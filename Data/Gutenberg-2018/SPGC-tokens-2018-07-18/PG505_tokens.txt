introduction
my
book
is
ready
for
the
printer
and
as
i
begin
this
preface
my
eye
lights
upon
the
crowd
of
russian
peasants
at
work
on
the
neva
under
my
windows
with
pick
and
shovel
they
are
letting
the
rays
of
the
april
sun
into
the
great
ice
barrier
which
binds
together
the
modern
quays
and
the
old
granite
fortress
where
lie
the
bones
of
the
romanoff
czars
this
barrier
is
already
weakened
it
is
widely
decayed
in
many
places
thin
and
everywhere
treacherous
but
it
is
as
a
whole
so
broad
so
crystallized
about
old
boulders
so
imbedded
in
shallows
so
wedged
into
crannies
on
either
shore
that
it
is
a
great
danger
the
waters
from
thousands
of
swollen
streamlets
above
are
pressing
behind
it
wreckage
and
refuse
are
piling
up
against
it
every
one
knows
that
it
must
yield
but
there
is
danger
that
it
may
resist
the
pressure
too
long
and
break
suddenly
wrenching
even
the
granite
quays
from
their
foundations
bringing
desolation
to
a
vast
population
and
leaving
after
the
subsidence
of
the
flood
a
widespread
residue
of
slime
a
fertile
for
the
germs
of
disease
but
the
patient
mujiks
are
doing
the
right
thing
the
barrier
exposed
more
and
more
to
the
warmth
of
spring
by
the
scores
of
channels
they
are
making
will
break
away
gradually
and
the
river
will
flow
on
beneficent
and
beautiful
my
work
in
this
book
is
like
that
of
the
russian
mujik
on
the
neva
i
simply
try
to
aid
in
letting
the
light
of
historical
truth
into
that
decaying
mass
of
outworn
thought
which
attaches
the
modern
world
to
mediaeval
conceptions
of
christianity
and
which
still
lingers
among
us
a
most
serious
barrier
to
religion
and
morals
and
a
menace
to
the
whole
normal
evolution
of
society
for
behind
this
barrier
also
the
flood
is
rapidly
rising
the
flood
of
increased
knowledge
and
new
thought
and
this
barrier
also
though
honeycombed
and
in
many
places
thin
creates
a
danger
danger
of
a
sudden
breaking
away
distressing
and
calamitous
sweeping
before
it
not
only
out
worn
creeds
and
noxious
dogmas
but
cherished
principles
and
ideals
and
even
wrenching
out
most
precious
religious
and
moral
foundations
of
the
whole
social
and
political
fabric
my
hope
is
to
aid
even
if
it
be
but
a
little
in
the
gradual
and
healthful
dissolving
away
of
this
mass
of
unreason
that
the
stream
of
religion
pure
and
undefiled
may
flow
on
broad
and
clear
a
blessing
to
humanity
and
now
a
few
words
regarding
the
evolution
of
this
book
it
is
something
over
a
quarter
of
a
century
since
i
labored
with
ezra
cornell
in
founding
the
university
which
bears
his
honored
name
our
purpose
was
to
establish
in
the
state
of
new
york
an
institution
for
advanced
instruction
and
research
in
which
science
pure
and
applied
should
have
an
equal
place
with
literature
in
which
the
study
of
literature
ancient
and
modern
should
be
emancipated
as
much
as
possible
from
pedantry
and
which
should
be
free
from
various
useless
trammels
and
vicious
methods
which
at
that
period
hampered
many
if
not
most
of
the
american
universities
and
colleges
we
had
especially
determined
that
the
institution
should
be
under
the
control
of
no
political
party
and
of
no
single
religious
sect
and
with
cornell
approval
i
embodied
stringent
provisions
to
this
effect
in
the
charter
it
had
certainly
never
entered
into
the
mind
of
either
of
us
that
in
all
this
we
were
doing
anything
irreligious
or
unchristian
cornell
was
reared
a
member
of
the
society
of
friends
he
had
from
his
fortune
liberally
aided
every
form
of
christian
effort
which
he
found
going
on
about
him
and
among
the
permanent
trustees
of
the
public
library
which
he
had
already
founded
he
had
named
all
the
clergymen
of
the
town
catholic
and
protestant
as
for
myself
i
had
been
bred
a
churchman
had
recently
been
elected
a
trustee
of
one
church
college
and
a
professor
in
another
those
nearest
and
dearest
to
me
were
devoutly
religious
and
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
speak
of
a
matter
so
personal
to
my
self
my
most
cherished
friendships
were
among
deeply
religious
men
and
women
and
my
greatest
sources
of
enjoyment
were
ecclesiastical
architecture
religious
music
and
the
more
devout
forms
of
poetry
so
far
from
wishing
to
injure
christianity
we
both
hoped
to
promote
it
but
we
did
not
confound
religion
with
sectarianism
and
we
saw
in
the
sectarian
character
of
american
colleges
and
universities
as
a
whole
a
reason
for
the
poverty
of
the
advanced
instruction
then
given
in
so
many
of
them
it
required
no
great
acuteness
to
see
that
a
system
of
control
which
in
selecting
a
professor
of
mathematics
or
language
or
rhetoric
or
physics
or
chemistry
asked
first
and
above
all
to
what
sect
or
even
to
what
wing
or
branch
of
a
sect
he
belonged
could
hardly
do
much
to
advance
the
moral
religious
or
intellectual
development
of
mankind
the
reasons
for
the
new
foundation
seemed
to
us
then
so
cogent
that
we
expected
the
of
all
good
citizens
and
anticipated
no
opposition
from
any
source
as
i
look
back
across
the
intervening
years
i
know
not
whether
to
be
more
astonished
or
amused
at
our
simplicity
opposition
began
at
once
in
the
state
legislature
it
confronted
us
at
every
turn
and
it
was
soon
in
full
blaze
throughout
the
state
from
the
good
protestant
bishop
who
proclaimed
that
all
professors
should
be
in
holy
orders
since
to
the
church
alone
was
given
the
command
go
teach
all
nations
to
the
zealous
priest
who
published
a
charge
that
goldwin
smith
a
profoundly
christian
scholar
had
come
to
cornell
in
order
to
inculcate
the
infidelity
of
the
westminster
review
and
from
the
eminent
divine
who
went
from
city
to
city
denouncing
the
atheistic
and
pantheistic
tendencies
of
the
proposed
education
to
the
perfervid
minister
who
informed
a
denominational
synod
that
agassiz
the
last
great
opponent
of
darwin
and
a
devout
theist
was
preaching
darwinism
and
atheism
in
the
new
institution
as
the
struggle
deepened
as
hostile
resolutions
were
introduced
into
various
ecclesiastical
bodies
as
honored
clergymen
solemnly
warned
their
flocks
first
against
the
atheism
then
against
the
infidelity
and
finally
against
the
indifferentism
of
the
university
as
devoted
pastors
endeavoured
to
dissuade
young
men
from
matriculation
i
took
the
defensive
and
in
answer
to
various
attacks
from
pulpits
and
religious
newspapers
attempted
to
allay
the
fears
of
the
public
sweet
reasonableness
was
fully
tried
there
was
established
and
endowed
in
the
university
perhaps
the
most
effective
christian
pulpit
and
one
of
the
most
vigorous
branches
of
the
christian
association
then
in
the
united
states
but
all
this
did
nothing
to
ward
off
the
attack
the
clause
in
the
charter
of
the
university
forbidding
it
to
give
predominance
to
the
doctrines
of
any
sect
and
above
all
the
fact
that
much
prominence
was
given
to
instruction
in
various
branches
of
science
seemed
to
prevent
all
compromise
and
it
soon
became
clear
that
to
stand
on
the
defensive
only
made
matters
worse
then
it
was
that
there
was
borne
in
upon
me
a
sense
of
the
real
difficulty
the
antagonism
between
the
theological
and
scientific
view
of
the
universe
and
of
education
in
relation
to
it
therefore
it
was
that
having
been
invited
to
deliver
a
lecture
in
the
great
hall
of
the
cooper
institute
at
new
york
i
took
as
my
subject
the
battlefields
of
science
maintaining
this
thesis
which
follows
in
all
modern
history
interference
with
science
in
the
supposed
interest
of
religion
no
matter
how
conscientious
such
interference
may
have
been
has
resulted
in
the
direst
evils
both
to
religion
and
science
and
invariably
and
on
the
other
hand
all
untrammeled
scientific
investigation
no
matter
how
dangerous
to
religion
some
of
its
stages
may
have
seemed
for
the
time
to
be
has
invariably
resulted
in
the
highest
good
both
of
religion
and
science
the
lecture
was
next
day
published
in
the
new
york
tribune
at
the
request
of
horace
greeley
its
editor
who
was
also
one
of
the
cornell
university
trustees
as
a
result
of
this
widespread
publication
and
of
sundry
attacks
which
it
elicited
i
was
asked
to
maintain
my
thesis
before
various
university
associations
and
literary
clubs
and
i
shall
always
remember
with
gratitude
that
among
those
who
stood
by
me
and
presented
me
on
the
lecture
platform
with
words
of
approval
and
cheer
was
my
revered
instructor
the
rev
theodore
dwight
woolsey
at
that
time
president
of
yale
college
my
lecture
grew
first
into
a
couple
of
magazine
articles
and
then
into
a
little
book
called
the
warfare
of
science
for
which
when
republished
in
england
john
tyndall
wrote
a
preface
sundry
translations
of
this
little
book
were
published
but
the
most
curious
thing
in
its
history
is
the
fact
that
a
very
friendly
introduction
to
the
swedish
translation
was
written
by
a
lutheran
bishop
meanwhile
john
draper
published
his
book
on
the
conflict
between
science
and
religion
a
work
of
great
ability
which
as
i
then
thought
ended
the
matter
so
far
as
my
giving
it
further
attention
was
concerned
but
two
things
led
me
to
keep
on
developing
my
own
work
in
this
field
first
i
had
become
deeply
interested
in
it
and
could
not
refrain
from
directing
my
observation
and
study
to
it
secondly
much
as
i
admired
draper
treatment
of
the
questions
involved
his
point
of
view
and
mode
of
looking
at
history
were
different
from
mine
he
regarded
the
struggle
as
one
between
science
and
religion
i
believed
then
and
am
convinced
now
that
it
was
a
struggle
between
science
and
dogmatic
theology
more
and
more
i
saw
that
it
was
the
conflict
between
two
epochs
in
the
evolution
of
human
thought
the
theological
and
the
scientific
so
i
kept
on
and
from
time
to
time
published
new
chapters
in
the
warfare
of
science
as
magazine
articles
in
the
popular
science
monthly
this
was
done
under
many
difficulties
for
twenty
years
as
president
of
cornell
university
and
professor
of
history
in
that
institution
i
was
immersed
in
the
work
of
its
early
development
besides
this
i
could
not
hold
myself
entirely
aloof
from
public
affairs
and
was
three
times
sent
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
do
public
duty
abroad
first
as
a
commissioner
to
santo
domingo
in
afterward
as
minister
to
germany
in
finally
as
minister
to
russia
in
and
was
also
called
upon
by
the
state
of
new
york
to
do
considerable
labor
in
connection
with
international
exhibitions
at
philadelphia
and
at
paris
i
was
also
obliged
from
time
to
time
to
throw
off
by
travel
the
effects
of
overwork
the
variety
of
residence
and
occupation
arising
from
these
causes
may
perhaps
explain
some
peculiarities
in
this
book
which
might
otherwise
puzzle
my
reader
while
these
journeyings
have
enabled
me
to
collect
materials
over
a
very
wide
range
in
the
new
world
from
quebec
to
santo
domingo
and
from
boston
to
mexico
san
francisco
and
seattle
and
in
the
old
world
from
trondhjem
to
cairo
and
from
petersburg
to
palermo
they
have
often
obliged
me
to
write
under
circumstances
not
very
favorable
sometimes
on
an
atlantic
steamer
sometimes
on
a
nile
boat
and
not
only
in
my
own
library
at
cornell
but
in
those
of
berlin
helsingfors
munich
florence
and
the
british
museum
this
fact
will
explain
to
the
benevolent
reader
not
only
the
citation
of
different
editions
of
the
same
authority
in
different
chapters
but
some
iterations
which
in
the
steady
quiet
of
my
own
library
would
not
have
been
made
it
has
been
my
constant
endeavour
to
write
for
the
general
reader
avoiding
scholastic
and
technical
terms
as
much
as
possible
and
stating
the
truth
simply
as
it
presents
itself
to
me
that
errors
of
omission
and
commission
will
be
found
here
and
there
is
probable
nay
certain
but
the
substance
of
the
book
will
i
believe
be
found
fully
true
i
am
encouraged
in
this
belief
by
the
fact
that
of
the
three
bitter
attacks
which
this
work
in
its
earlier
form
has
already
encountered
one
was
purely
declamatory
objurgatory
and
hortatory
and
the
others
based
upon
ignorance
of
facts
easily
pointed
out
and
here
i
must
express
my
thanks
to
those
who
have
aided
me
first
and
above
all
to
my
former
student
and
dear
friend
george
lincoln
burr
of
cornell
university
to
whose
contributions
suggestions
criticisms
and
cautions
i
am
most
deeply
indebted
also
to
my
friends
weatherly
formerly
travelling
fellow
of
cornell
and
now
assistant
professor
in
the
university
of
indiana
and
earl
barnes
and
william
hudson
of
stanford
university
and
p
evans
formerly
of
the
university
of
michigan
but
now
of
munich
for
extensive
aid
in
researches
upon
the
lines
i
have
indicated
to
them
but
which
i
could
never
have
prosecuted
without
their
in
libraries
at
home
and
abroad
they
have
all
worked
for
me
most
effectively
and
i
am
deeply
grateful
to
them
this
book
is
presented
as
a
sort
of
festschrift
a
tribute
to
cornell
university
as
it
enters
the
second
of
its
existence
and
probably
my
last
tribute
the
ideas
for
which
so
bitter
a
struggle
was
made
at
its
foundation
have
triumphed
its
faculty
numbering
over
one
hundred
and
fifty
its
students
numbering
but
little
short
of
two
thousand
its
noble
buildings
and
equipment
the
munificent
gifts
now
amounting
to
millions
of
dollars
which
it
has
received
from
men
and
women
the
evidences
of
public
confidence
on
all
sides
and
above
all
the
adoption
of
its
cardinal
principles
and
main
features
by
various
institutions
of
learning
in
other
states
show
this
abundantly
but
there
has
been
a
triumph
far
greater
and
wider
everywhere
among
the
leading
modern
nations
the
same
general
tendency
is
seen
during
the
just
past
the
control
of
public
instruction
not
only
in
america
but
in
the
leading
nations
of
europe
has
passed
more
and
more
from
the
clergy
to
the
laity
not
only
are
the
presidents
of
the
larger
universities
in
the
united
states
with
but
one
or
two
exceptions
laymen
but
the
same
thing
is
seen
in
the
old
european
strongholds
of
metaphysical
theology
at
my
first
visit
to
oxford
and
cambridge
forty
years
ago
they
were
entirely
under
ecclesiastical
control
now
all
this
is
changed
an
eminent
member
of
the
present
british
government
has
recently
said
a
candidate
for
high
university
position
is
handicapped
by
holy
orders
i
refer
to
this
with
not
the
slightest
feeling
of
hostility
toward
the
clergy
for
i
have
none
among
them
are
many
of
my
dearest
friends
no
one
honours
their
proper
work
more
than
i
but
the
above
fact
is
simply
noted
as
proving
the
continuance
of
that
evolution
which
i
have
endeavoured
to
describe
in
this
series
of
monographs
an
evolution
indeed
in
which
the
warfare
of
theology
against
science
has
been
one
of
the
most
active
and
powerful
agents
my
belief
is
that
in
the
field
left
to
them
their
proper
field
the
clergy
will
more
and
more
as
they
cease
to
struggle
against
scientific
methods
and
conclusions
do
work
even
nobler
and
more
beautiful
than
anything
they
have
heretofore
done
and
this
is
saying
much
my
conviction
is
that
science
though
it
has
evidently
conquered
dogmatic
theology
based
on
biblical
texts
and
ancient
modes
of
thought
will
go
hand
in
hand
with
religion
and
that
although
theological
control
will
continue
to
diminish
religion
as
seen
in
the
recognition
of
a
power
in
the
universe
not
ourselves
which
makes
for
righteousness
and
in
the
love
of
god
and
of
our
neighbor
will
steadily
grow
stronger
and
stronger
not
only
in
the
american
institutions
of
learning
but
in
the
world
at
large
thus

preserve

much
of

theology
one
frequently
recurring
group
is
noteworthy
for
its
presentment
of
a
doctrine
regarding
the
origin
of
the
universe
the
almighty
in
human
form
sits
benignly
making
the
sun
moon
and
stars
and
hanging
them
from

firmament

supports

work

the
knotted
muscles

arms
show
that
he
is
obliged
to
toil
naturally
then
the
sculptors
and
painters
of
the
medieval
and
early
modern
period
frequently
represented
him
as
the
writers
whose
conceptions
they
embodied
had
done
as
on
the
seventh
day
weary
after
thought
and
toil
enjoying
repose
and
the
plaudits
of
the
hosts
of
heaven
in
these
of
the
cathedrals
and
in
other
revelations
of
the
same
idea
through
sculpture
painting
mosaic
work
and
engraving
during
the
middle
ages
and
the
two
centuries
following
culminated
a
belief
which
had
been
developed
through
thousands
of
years
and
which
has
determined
the
world
thought
until
our
own
time
its
beginnings
lie
far
back
in
human
history
we
find
them
among
the
early
records
of
nearly
all
the
great
civilizations
and
they
hold
a
most
prominent
place
in
the
various
sacred
books
of
the
world
in
nearly
all
of
them
is
revealed
the
conception
of
a
creator
of
whom
man
is
an
imperfect
image
and
who
literally
and
directly
created
the
visible
universe
with
his
hands
and
fingers
among
these
theories
of
especial
interest
to
us
are
those
which
controlled
theological
thought
in
chaldea
the
assyrian
inscriptions
which
have
been
recently
recovered
and
given
to
the
peoples
by
layard
george
smith
sayce
and
others
show
that
in
the
ancient
religions
of
chaldea
and
babylonia
there
was
elaborated
a
narrative
of
the
creation
which
in
its
most
important
features
must
have
been
the
source
of
that
in
our
own
sacred
books
it
has
now
become
perfectly
clear
that
from
the
same
sources
which
inspired
the
accounts
of
the
creation
of
the
universe
among
the
the
assyrian
the
phoenician
and
other
ancient
civilizations
came
the
ideas
which
hold
so
prominent
a
place
in
the
sacred
books
of
the
hebrews
in
the
two
accounts
imperfectly
fused
together
in
genesis
and
also
in
the
account
of
which
we
have
indications
in
the
book
of
job
and
in
the
proverbs
there
is
presented
often
with
the
greatest
sublimity
the
same
early
conception
of
the
creator
and
of
the
creation
the
conception
so
natural
in
the
childhood
of
civilization
of
a
creator
who
is
an
enlarged
human
being
working
literally
with
his
own
hands
and
of
a
creation
which
is
the
work
of
his
fingers
to
supplement
this
view
there
was
developed
the
belief
in
this
creator
as
one
who
having
from
his
ample
palm
launched
forth
the
rolling
planets
into
space
sits
on
high
enthroned
upon
the
circle
of
the
heavens
perpetually
controlling
and
directing
them
from
this
idea
of
creation
was
evolved
in
time
a
somewhat
nobler
view
ancient
thinkers
and
especially
as
is
now
found
in
egypt
suggested
that
the
main
agency
in
creation
was
not
the
hands
and
fingers
of
the
creator
but
his
voice
hence
was
mingled
with
the
earlier
cruder
belief
regarding
the
origin
of
the
earth
and
heavenly
bodies
by
the
almighty
the
more
impressive
idea
that
he
spake
and
they
were
made
that
they
were
brought
into
existence
by
his
word
among
the
many
mediaeval
representations
of
the
creation
of
the
universe
i
especially
recall
from
personal
observation
those
sculptured
above
the
portals
of
the
cathedrals
of
freiburg
and
upsala
the
paintings
on
the
walls

striking

and
those
in
the
capella

at

among
peculiarities
showing
the
simplicity
of
the
earlier
conception
the
representation
of
the
response
of
the
almighty
on
the
seventh
day
is
very
striking
he
is
shown
as
seated
in
almost
the
exact
attitude
of
the
weary
mercury
of
classic
sculpture
bent
and
with
a
very
marked
expression

fatigue

the
dawn
of

pp
among
the
early
fathers
of
the
church
this
general
view
of
creation
became
fundamental
they
impressed
upon
christendom
more
and
more
strongly
the
belief
that
the
universe
was
created
in
a
perfectly
literal
sense
by
the
hands
or
voice
of
god
here
and
there
sundry
theologians
of
larger
mind
attempted
to
give
a
more
spiritual
view
regarding
some
parts
of
the
creative
work
and
of
these
were
gregory
of
nyssa
and
augustine
ready
as
they
were
to
accept
the
literal
text
of
scripture
they
revolted
against
the
conception
of
an
actual
creation
of
the
universe
by
the
hands
and
fingers
of
a
supreme
being
and
in
this
they
were
followed
by
bede
and
a
few
others
but
the
more
material
conceptions
prevailed
and
we
find
these
taking
shape
not
only
in
the
sculptures
and
mosaics
and
stained
glass
of
cathedrals
and
in
the
illuminations
of
missals
and
psalters
but
later
at
the
close
of
the
middle
ages
in
the
pictured
bibles
and
in
general
literature
into
the
mind
this
ancient
material
conception
of
the
creation
was
riveted
by
two
poets
whose
works
appealed
especially
to
the
deeper
religious
feelings
in
the
seventh
century
caedmon
paraphrased
the
account
given
in

bringing
out
this
material
conception
in
the
most
literal
form
and
a
thousand
years
later
milton
developed
out
of
the
various
statements
in
the
old
testament
mingled
with
a
theology
regarding
the
creative
word
which
had
been
drawn
from
the
new
his
description
of
the
creation
by
the
second
person
in
the
trinity
than
which
nothing
could
be
more
literal

so
much
for
the
orthodox
view
of
the
manner
of
creation
the
next
point
developed
in
this
theologic
evolution
had
reference
to
the
matter
of
which
the
universe
was
made
and
it
was
decided
by
an
overwhelming
majority
that
no
material
substance
existed
before
the
creation
of
the
material
universe
that
god
created
everything
out
of
nothing
some
venturesome
thinkers
basing
their
reasoning
upon
the
first
verses
of
genesis
hinted
at
a
different
view
namely
that
the
mass
without
form
and
void
existed
before
the
universe
but
this
doctrine
was
soon
swept
out
of
sight
the
vast
majority
of
the
fathers
were
explicit
on
this
point
tertullian
especially
was
very
severe
against
those
who
took
any
other
view
than
that
generally
accepted
as
orthodox
he
declared
that
if
there
had
been
any
matter
out
of
which
the
world
was
formed
scripture
would
have
mentioned
it
that
by
not
mentioning
it
god
has
given
us
a
clear
proof
that
there
was
no
such
thing
and
after
a
manner
not
unknown
in
other
theological
controversies
he
threatens
hermogenes
who
takes
the
opposite
view
with
the
woe
which
impends
on
all
who
add
to
or
take
away
from
the
written
word
augustine
who
showed
signs
of
a
belief
in
a
of
matter
made
his
peace
with
the
prevailing
belief
by
the
simple
reasoning
that
although
the
world
has
been
made
of
some
material
that
very
same
material
must
have
been
made
out
of
nothing
in
the
wake
of
these
great
men
the
universal
church
steadily
followed
the
fourth
lateran
council
declared
that
god
created
everything
out
of
nothing
and
at
the
present
hour
the
vast
majority
of
the
faithful
whether
catholic
or
protestant
are
taught
the
same
doctrine
on
this
point

syllabus
of

catholic

having
thus
disposed
of
the
manner
and
matter
of
creation
the
next
subject
taken
up
by
theologians
was
the
time
required
for
the
great
work
here
came
a
difficulty
the
first
of
the
two
accounts
given
in
genesis
extended
the
creative
operation
through
six
days
each
of
an
evening
and
a
morning
with
much
explicit
detail
regarding
the
progress
made
in
each
but
the
second
account
spoke
of
the
day
in
which
the
lord
god
made
the
earth
and
the
heavens
the
explicitness
of
the
first
account
and
its
naturalness
to
the
minds
of
the
great
mass
of
early
theologians
gave
it
at
first
a
decided
advantage
but
jewish
thinkers
like
philo
and
christian
thinkers
like
origen
forming
higher
conceptions
of
the
creator
and
his
work
were
not
content
with
this
and
by
them
was
launched
upon
the
troubled
sea
of
christian
theology
the
idea
that
the
creation
was
instantaneous
this
idea
being
strengthened
not
only
by
the
second
of
the
genesis
legends
but
by
the
great
text
he
spake
and
it
was
done
he
commanded
and
it
stood
fast
or
as
it
appears
in
the
vulgate
and
in
most
translations
he
spake
and
they
were
made
he
commanded
and
they
were
created
as
a
result
it
began
to
be
held
that
the
safe
and
proper
course
was
to
believe
literally
both
statements
that
in
some
mysterious
manner
god
created
the
universe
in
six
days
and
yet
brought
it
all
into
existence
in
a
moment
in
spite
of
the
outcries
of
sundry
great
theologians
like
ephrem
syrus
that
the
universe
was
created
in
exactly
six
days
of
hours
each
this
compromise
was
promoted
by
athanasius
and
st
basil
in
the
east
and
by
augustine
and
hilary
in
the
west
serious
difficulties
were
found
in
reconciling
these
two
views
which
to
the
natural
mind
seem
absolutely
contradictory
but
by
ingenious
manipulation
of
texts
by
dexterous
play
upon
phrases
and
by
the
abundant
use
of
metaphysics
to
dissolve
away
facts
a
reconciliation
was
effected
and
men
came
at
least
to
believe
that
they
believed
in
a
creation
of
the
universe
instantaneous
and
at
the
same
time
extended
through
six
days

accounts

record

eastern
and
western
developed
out
of
the
double
account
in
genesis
and
the
indications
in
the
psalms
the
proverbs
and
the
book
of
job
a
vast
mass
of
sacred
science
bearing
upon
this
point
as
regards
the
whole
work
of
creation
stress
was
laid
upon
certain
occult
powers
in
numerals
philo
judaeus
while
believing
in
an
instantaneous
creation
had
also
declared
that
the
world
was
created
in
six
days
because
of
all
numbers
six
is
the
most
productive
he
had
explained
the
creation
of
the
heavenly
bodies
on
the
fourth
day
by
the
harmony
of
the
number
four
of
the
animals
on
the
fifth
day
by
the
five
senses
of
man
on
the
sixth
day
by
the
same
virtues
in
the
number
six
which
had
caused
it
to
be
set
as
a
limit
to
the
creative
work
and
greatest
of
all
the
rest
on
the
seventh
day
by
the
vast
mass
of
mysterious
virtues
in
the
number
seven
jerome
held
that
the
reason
why
god
did
not
pronounce
the
work
of
the
second
day
good
is
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
there
is
something
essentially
evil
in
the
number
two
and
this
was
echoed
centuries
afterward
afar
off
in
britain
by
bede
augustine
brought
this
view
to
bear
upon
the
church
in
the
following
statement
there
are
three
classes
of
numbers
the
more
than
perfect
the
perfect
and
the
less
than
perfect
according
as
the
sum
of
them
is
greater
than
equal
to
or
less
than
the
original
number
six
is
the
first
perfect
number
wherefore
we
must
not
say
that
six
is
a
perfect
number
because
god
finished
all
his
works
in
six
days
but
that
god
finished
all
his
works
in
six
days
because
six
is
a
perfect
number
reasoning
of
this
sort
echoed
along
through
the
mediaeval
church
until
a
year
after
the
discovery
of
america
when
the
nuremberg
chronicle
it
as
follows
the
creation
of
things
is
explained
by
the
number
six
the
parts
of
which
one
two
and
three
assume
the
form
of
a
triangle
this
view
of
the
creation
of
the
universe
as
instantaneous
and
also
as
in
six
days
each
made
up
of
an
evening
and
a
morning
became
virtually
universal
peter
lombard
and
hugo
of

authorities
of
vast
weight
gave
it
their
sanction
in
the
twelfth
century
and
impressed
it
for
ages
upon
the
mind
of
the
church
both
these
lines
of
speculation
as
to
the
creation
of
everything
out
of
nothing
and
the
reconciling
of
the
instantaneous
creation
of
the
universe
with
its
creation
in
six
days
were
still
further
developed
by
other
great
thinkers
of
the
middle
ages
hilary
of
poictiers
reconciled
the
two
conceptions
as
follows
for
although
according
to
moses
there
is
an
appearance
of
regular
order
in
the
fixing
of
the
firmament
the
laying
bare
of
the
dry
land
the
gathering
together
of
the
waters
the
formation
of
the
heavenly
bodies
and
the
arising
of
living
things
from
land
and
water
yet
the
creation
of
the
heavens
earth
and
other
elements
is
seen
to
be
the
work
of
a
single
moment
thomas
aquinas
drew
from
augustine
a
subtle
distinction
which
for
ages
eased
the
difficulties
in
the
case
he
taught
in
effect
that
god
created
the
substance
of
things
in
a
moment
but
gave
to
the
work
of
separating
shaping
and

this
creation

accepted

developed
the

view
and
luther
especially
showed
himself
equal
to

occasion

his
usual
boldness
he
declared
first
that
moses
spoke
properly
and
plainly
and
neither
allegorically
nor
figuratively
and
that
therefore
the
world
with
all
creatures
was
created
in
six
days
and
he
then
goes
on
to
show
how
by
a
great
miracle
the
whole
creation
was
also
instantaneous
melanchthon
also
insisted
that
the
universe
was
created
out
of
nothing
and
in
a
mysterious
way
both
in
an
instant
and
in
six
days
citing
the
text
he
spake
and
they
were
made
calvin
opposed
the
idea
of
an
instantaneous
creation
and
laid
especial
stress
on
the
creation
in
six
days
having
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
biblical
chronology
shows
the
world
to
be
not
quite
six
thousand
years
old
and
that
it
is
now
near
its
end
he
says
that
creation
was
extended
through
six
days
that
it
might
not
be
tedious
for
us
to
occupy
the
whole
of
life
in
the
consideration
of
it
peter
martyr
clinched
the
matter
by
declaring
so
important
is
it
to
comprehend
the
work
of
creation
that
we
see
the
creed
of
the
church
take
this
as
its
starting
point
were
this
article
taken
away
there
would
be
no
original
sin
the
promise
of
christ
would
become
void
and
all
the
vital
force
of
our
religion
would
be
destroyed
the
westminster
divines
in
drawing
up
their
confession
of
faith
specially
laid
it
down
as
necessary
to
believe
that
all
things
visible
and
invisible
were
created
not
only
out
of
nothing
but
in
exactly
six
days
nor
were
the
roman
divines
less
strenuous
than
the
protestant
reformers
regarding
the
necessity
of
holding
closely
to
the
mosaic
account
of
creation
as
late
as
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
when
buffon
attempted
to
state
simple
geological
truths
the
theological
faculty
of
the
sorbonne
forced
him
to
make
and
to
publish
a
most
ignominious
recantation
which
ended
with
these
words
i
abandon
everything
in
my
book
respecting
the
formation
of
the
earth
and
generally
all
which
may
be
contrary
to
the
narrative
of
moses
theologians
having
thus
settled
the
manner
of
the
creation
the
matter
used
in
it
and
the
time
required
for
it
now
exerted
themselves
to
fix
its
date
the
long
series
of
efforts
by
the
greatest
minds
in
the
church
from
eusebius
to
archbishop
usher
to
settle
this
point
are
presented
in
another
chapter
suffice
it
here
that
the
general
conclusion
arrived
at
by
an
overwhelming
majority
of
the
most
competent
students
of
the
biblical
accounts
was
that
the
date
of
creation
was
in
round
numbers
four
thousand
years
before
our
era
and
in
the
seventeenth
century
in
his
great
work
john
lightfoot
of
the
university
of
cambridge
and
one
of
the
most
eminent
hebrew
scholars
of
his
time
declared
as
the
result
of
his
most
profound
and
exhaustive
study
of
the
scriptures
that
heaven
and
earth
centre
and
circumference
were
created
all
together
in
the
same
instant
and
clouds
full
of
water
and
that
this
work
took
place
and
man
was
created
by
the
trinity
on
october
at
nine
in
the
morning
here
was
indeed
a
triumph
of
lactantius
method
the
result
of
hundreds
of
years
of
biblical
study
and
theological
thought
since
bede
in
the
eighth
century
and
vincent
of
beauvais
in
the
thirteenth
had
declared
that
creation
must
have
taken
place
in
the
spring
yet
alas
within
two
centuries
after
lightfoot
great
biblical
demonstration
as
to
the
exact
hour
of
creation
it
was
discovered
that
at
that
hour
an
exceedingly
cultivated
people
enjoying
all
the
fruits
of
a
highly
developed
civilization
had
long
been
swarming
in
the
great
cities
of
egypt
and
that
other
nations
hardly
less
advanced
had
at

but
strange
as
it
may
seem
even
after
theologians
had
thus
settled
the
manner
of
creation
the
matter
employed
in
it
the
time
required
for
it
and
the
exact
date
of
it
there
remained
virtually
unsettled
the
first
and
greatest
question
of
all
and
this
was
nothing
less
than
the
question
who
actually
created
the
universe
various
theories
more
or
less
nebulous
but
all
centred
in
texts
of
scripture
had
swept
through
the
mind
of
the
church
by
some
theologians
it
was
held
virtually
that
the
actual
creative
agent
was
the
third
person
of
the
trinity
who
in
the
opening
words
of
our
sublime
creation
poem
moved
upon
the
face
of
the
waters
by
others
it
was
held
that
the
actual
creator
was
the
second
person
of
the
trinity
in
behalf
of
whose
agency
many
texts
were
cited
from
the
new
testament
others
held
that
the
actual
creator
was
the
first
person
and
this
view
was
embodied
in
the
two
great
formulas
known
as
the
apostles
and
nicene
creeds
which
explicitly
assigned
the
work
to
god
the
father
almighty
maker
of
heaven
and
earth
others
finding
a
deep
meaning
in
the
words
let
us
make
ascribed
in
genesis
to
the
creator
held
that
the
entire
trinity
directly
created
all
things
and
still
others
by
curious
metaphysical
processes
seemed
to
arrive
at
the
idea
that
peculiar
combinations
of
two
persons
of
the
trinity
achieved
the
creation
in
all
this
there
would
seem
to
be
considerable
courage
in
view
of
the
fearful
condemnations
launched
in
the
athanasian
creed
against
all
who
should
confound
the
persons
or
divide
the
substance
of
the
trinity
these
various
stages
in
the
evolution
of
scholastic
theology
were
also
embodied
in
sacred
art
and
especially
in
cathedral
sculpture
in
in
mosaic
working
and
in
missal
painting
the
creative
being
is
thus
represented
sometimes
as
the
third
person
of
the
trinity
in
the
form
of
a
dove
brooding
over
chaos
sometimes
as
the
second
person
and
therefore
a
youth
sometimes
as
the
first
person
and
therefore
fatherly
and
venerable
sometimes
as
the
first
and
second
persons
one
being
venerable
and
the
other
youthful
and
sometimes
as
three
persons
one
venerable
and
one
youthful
both
wearing
papal
crowns
and
each
holding
in
his
lips
a
tip
of
the
wing
of
the
dove
which
thus
seems
to
proceed
from
both
and
to
be
suspended
between
them
nor
was
this
the
most
complete
development
of
the
medieval
idea
the
creator
was
sometimes
represented
with
a
single
body
but
with
three
faces
thus
showing
that
christian
belief
had
in
some
pious
minds
gone
through
substantially
the
same
cycle
which
an
earlier
form
of
belief
had
made
ages
before
in
india
when
the
supreme
being
was
represented
with
one
body
but
with
the
three
faces
of
brahma
vishnu
and
siva
but
at
the
beginning
of
the
modern
period
the
older
view
in
its
primitive
jewish
form
was
impressed
upon
christians
by
the
most
mighty
genius
in
art
the
world
has
known
for
in
after
four
years
of
titanic
labour

angelo

his
frescoes
within
the
vault
of
the
sistine
chapel
they
had
been
executed
by
the
command
and
under
the
sanction
of
the
ruling
pope
julius
ii
to
represent
the
conception
of
christian
theology
then
dominant
and
they
remain
in
all
their
majesty
to
show
the
highest
point
ever
attained
by
the
older
thought
upon
the
origin
of
the
visible
universe
in
the
midst
of

and
moving
through

compartments
of
the

vault

the
work
of
the
creative

a
simple
gesture

from

darkness

in
this
sublime
work
culminated
the
thought
of
thousands
of
years
the
strongest
minds
accepted
it
or
pretended
to
accept
it
and
nearly
two
centuries
later
this
conception
in
accordance
with
the
first
of
the
two
accounts
given
in
genesis
was
especially
enforced
by
bossuet
and
received
a
new
lease
of
life
in
the
church
both
catholic
and
protestant
for
strange
representations
of
the
creator
and
of
the
creation
by
one
two
or
three
persons
of
the
trinity
see
didron

and
elsewhere
also
detzel
as
already
cited
the
most
naive
of
all
survivals
of
the
mediaeval
idea
of
creation
which
the
present
writer
has
ever
seen
was
exhibited
in
on
the
banner
of
one
of
the
guilds
at
the
celebration
of
the
anniversary
of
the
founding
of
the
munich
cathedral
jesus
of
nazareth
as
a
beautiful
boy
and
with
a
nimbus
encircling
his
head
was
shown
turning
and
shaping
the
globe
on
a
lathe
which
he
keeps
in
motion
with
his
foot
the
emblems
of
the
passion
are
about
him
god
the
father
looking
approvingly
upon
him
from
a
cloud
and
the
dove
hovering
between
the
two
the
date
upon
the
banner
was
but
to
these
discussions
was
added
yet
another
which
beginning
in
the
early
days
of
the
church
was
handed
down
the
ages
until
it
had
died
out
among
the
theologians
of
our
own
time
in
the
first
of
the
biblical
accounts
light
is
created
and
the
distinction
between
day
and
night
thereby
made
on
the
first
day
while
the
sun
and
moon
are
not
created
until
the
fourth
day
masses
of
profound
theological
and
reasoning
have
been
developed
to
account
for
this
masses
so
great
that
for
ages
they
have
obscured
the
simple
fact
that
the
original
text
is
a
precious
revelation
to
us
of
one
of
the
most
ancient
of
recorded
beliefs
the
belief
that
light
and
darkness
are
entities
independent
of
the
heavenly
bodies
and
that
the
sun
moon
and
stars
exist
not
merely
to
increase
light
but
to
divide
the
day
from
the
night
to
be
for
signs
and
for
seasons
and
for
days
and
for
years
and
to
rule
the
day
and
the
night
of
this
belief
we
find
survivals
among
the
early
fathers
and
especially
in
ambrose
in
his
work
on
creation
he
tells
us
we
must
remember
that
the
light
of
day
is
one
thing
and
the
light
of
the
sun
moon
and
stars
another
the
sun
by
his
rays
appearing
to
add
lustre
to
the
daylight
for
before
sunrise
the
day
dawns
but
is
not
in
full
refulgence
for
the
sun
adds
still
further
to
its
splendour
this
idea
became
one
of
the
treasures
of
sacred
knowledge
committed
to
the
church
and
was
faithfully
received
by
the
middle
ages
the
medieval
mysteries
and
miracle
plays
give
curious
evidences
of
this
in
a
performance
of
the
creation
when
god
separates
light
from
darkness
the
stage
direction
is
now
a
painted
cloth
is
to
be
exhibited
one
half
black
and

figures
of

each
suitably

see

didron
iconographie
thus
down
to
a
period
almost
within
living
memory
it
was
held
virtually
always
everywhere
and
by
all
that
the
universe
as
we
now
see
it
was
created
literally
and
directly
by
the
voice
or
hands
of
the
almighty
or
by
both
out
of
nothing
in
an
instant
or
in
six
days
or
in
both
about
four
thousand
years
before
the
christian
era
and
for
the
convenience
of
the
dwellers
upon
the
earth
which
was
at
the
base
and
foundation
of
the
whole
structure
but
there
had
been
implanted
along
through
the
ages
germs
of
another
growth
in
human
thinking
some
of
them
even
as
early
as
the
babylonian
period
in
the
assyrian
inscriptions
we
find
recorded
the
idea
of
an
evolution
of
the
universe
out
of
the
primeval
flood
or
great
deep
and
of
the
animal
creation
out
of
the
earth
and
sea
this
idea
recast
partially
at
least
into
monotheistic
form
passed
naturally
into
the
sacred
books
of
the
neighbours
and
pupils
of
the
chaldeans
the
hebrews
but
its
growth
in
christendom
afterward
was
checked
as
we
shall
hereafter
find
by
the
more
powerful
influence
of
other
inherited
statements
which
appealed
more
intelligibly
to
the
mind
of
the
church
striking
also
was
the
effect
of
this
idea
as
rewrought
by
the
early
ionian
philosophers
to
whom
it
was
probably
transmitted
from
the
chaldeans
through
the
phoenicians
in
the
minds
of
ionians
like
anaximander
and
anaximenes
it
was
most
clearly
developed
the
first
of
these
conceiving
of
the
visible
universe
as
the
result
of
processes
of
evolution
and
the
latter
pressing
further
the
same
mode
of
reasoning
and
dwelling
on
agencies
in
cosmic
development
recognised
in
modern
science
this
general
idea
of
evolution
in
nature
thus
took
strong
hold
upon
greek
thought
and
was
developed
in
many
ways
some
ingenious
some
perverse
plato
indeed
withstood
it
but
aristotle
sometimes
developed
it
in
a
manner
which
reminds
us
of
modern
views
among
the
romans
lucretius
caught
much
from
it
extending
the
evolutionary
process
virtually
to
all
things
in
the
early
church
as
we
have
seen
the
idea
of
a
creation
direct
material
and
by
means
like
those
used
by
man
was
for
the
exclusion
of
conceptions
based
on
evolution
from
the
more
simple
and
crude
of
the
views
of
creation
given
in
the
babylonian
legends
and
thence
incorporated
into
genesis
rose
the
stream
of
orthodox
thought
on
the
subject
which
grew
into
a
flood
and
swept
on
through
the
middle
ages
and
into
modern
times
yet
here
and
there
in
the
midst
of
this
flood
were
high
grounds
of
thought
held
by
strong
men
scotus
erigena
and
duns
scotus
among
the
schoolmen
bewildered
though
they
were
had
caught
some
rays
of
this
ancient
light
and
passed
on
to
their
successors
in
modified
form
doctrines
of
an
evolutionary
process
in
the
universe
in
the
latter
half
of
the
sixteenth
century
these
evolutionary
theories
seemed
to
take
more
definite
form
in
the
mind
of
giordano
bruno
who
evidently
divined
the
fundamental
idea
of
what
is
now
known
as
the
nebular
hypothesis
but
with
his
murder
by
the
inquisition
at
rome
this
idea
seemed
utterly
to
disappear
dissipated
by
the
flames
which
in
consumed
his
body
on
the
campo
dei
fiori
yet
within
the
two
centuries
divided
by
bruno
death
the
world
was
led
into
a
new
realm
of
thought
in
which
an
evolution
theory
of
the
visible
universe
was
sure
to
be
rapidly
developed
for
there
came
one
after
the
other
five
of
the
greatest
men
our
race
has
produced
copernicus
kepler
galileo
descartes
and
newton
and
when
their
work
was
done
the
old
theological
conception
of
the
universe
was
gone
the
spacious
firmament
on
high
the
crystalline
spheres
the
almighty
enthroned
upon
the
circle
of
the
heavens
and
with
his
own
lands
or
with
angels
as
his
agents
keeping
sun
moon
and
planets
in
motion
for
the
benefit
of
the
earth
opening
and
closing
the
windows
of
heaven
letting
down
upon
the
earth
the
waters
above
the
firmament
setting
his
bow
in
the
cloud
hanging
out
signs
and
wonders
hurling
comets
casting
forth
lightnings
to
scare
the
wicked
and
shaking
the
earth
in
his
wrath
all
this
had
disappeared
these
five
men
had
given
a
new
divine
revelation
to
the
world
and
through
the
last
newton
had
come
a
vast
new
conception
destined
to
be
fatal
to
the
old
theory
of
creation
for
he
had
shown
throughout
the
universe
in
place
of
almighty
caprice
law
the
bitter
opposition
of
theology
to
the
first
four
of
these
men
is
well
known
but
the
fact
is
not
so
widely
known
that
newton
in
spite
of
his
deeply
religious
spirit
was
also
strongly
opposed
it
was
vigorously
urged
against
him
that
by
his
statement
of
the
law
of
gravitation
he
took
from
god
that
direct
action
on
his
works
so
constantly
ascribed
to
him
in
scripture
and
transferred
it
to
material
mechanism
and
that
he
substituted
gravitation
for
providence
but
more
than
this
these
men
gave
a
new
basis
for
the
theory
of
evolution
as
distinguished
from
the
theory
of
creation
especially
worthy
of
note
is
it
that
the
great
work
of
descartes
erroneous
as
many
of
its
deductions
were
and
in
view
of
the
lack
of
physical
knowledge
in
his
time
must
be
had
done
much
to
weaken
the
old
conception
his
theory
of
a
universe
brought
out
of
matter
wrought
into
orderly
arrangement
by
movements
in
accordance
with
physical
laws
though
it
was
but
a
provisional
hypothesis
had
done
much
to
draw
men
minds
from
the
old
theological
view
of
creation
it
was
an
example
of
intellectual
honesty
arriving
at
errors
but
thereby
aiding
the
advent
of
truths
crippled
though
descartes
was
by
his
almost
morbid
fear
of
the
church
this
part
of
his
work
was
no
small
factor
in
bringing
in
that
attitude
of
mind
which
led
to
a
reception
of
the
thoughts
of
more
unfettered
thinkers
thirty
years
later
came
in
england
an
effort
of
a
different
sort
but
with
a
similar
result
in
ralph
cudworth
published
his
intellectual
system
of
the
universe
to
this
day
he
remains
in
breadth
of
scholarship
in
strength
of
thought
in
tolerance
and
in
honesty
one
of
the
greatest
glories
of
the
english
church
and
his
work
was
worthy
of
him
he
purposed
to
build
a
fortress
which
should
protect
christianity
against
all
dangerous
theories
of
the
universe
ancient
or
modern
the
foundations
of
the
structure
were
laid
with
old
thoughts
thrown
often
into
new
and
striking
forms
but
as
the
superstructure
arose
more
and
more
into
view
while
genius
marked
every
part
of
it
features
appeared
which
gave
the
rigidly
orthodox
serious
misgivings
from
the
old
theories
of
direct
personal
action
on
the
universe
by
the
almighty
he
broke
utterly
he
dwelt
on
the
action
of
law
rejected
the
continuous
exercise
of
miraculous
intervention
pointed
out
the
fact
that
in
the
natural
world
there
are
errors
and
bungles
and
argued
vigorously
in
favour
of
the
origin
and
maintenance
of
the
universe
as
a
slow
and
gradual
development
of
nature
in
obedience
to
an
inward
principle
the
balaks
of
orthodoxy
might
well
condemn
this
honest
balaam
toward
the
end
of
the
next
century
a
still
more
profound
genius
immanuel
kant
presented
the
nebular
theory
giving
it
in
the
light
of
newton
great
utterances
a
consistency
which
it
never
before
had
and
about
the
same
time
laplace
gave
it
yet
greater
strength
by
mathematical
reasonings
of
wonderful
power
and
extent
thus
implanting
firmly
in
modern
thought
the
idea
that
our
own
solar
system
and
others
suns
planets
satellites
and
their
various
movements
distances
and
magnitudes
necessarily
result
from
the
obedience
of
nebulous
masses
to
natural
laws
throughout
the
theological
world
there
was
an
outcry
at
once
against
atheism
and
war
raged
fiercely
herschel
and
others
pointed
out
many
nebulous
patches
apparently
gaseous
they
showed
by
physical
and
mathematical
demonstrations
that
the
hypothesis
accounted
for
the
great
body
of
facts
and
despite
clamour
were
gaining
ground
when
the
improved
telescopes
resolved
some
of
the
patches
of
nebulous
matter
into
multitudes
of
stars
the
opponents
of
the
nebular
hypothesis
were
overjoyed
they
now
sang
paeans
to
astronomy
because
as
they
said
it
had
proved
the
truth
of
scripture
they
had
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
all
nebula
must
be
alike
that
if
some
are
made
up
of
systems
of
stars
all
must
be
so
made
up
that
none
can
be
masses
of
attenuated
gaseous
matter
because
some
are
not
science
halted
for
a
time
the
accepted
doctrine
became
this
that
the
only
reason
why
all
the
nebula
are
not
resolved
into
distinct
stars
is
that
our
telescopes
are
not
sufficiently
powerful
but
in
time
came
the
discovery
of
the
spectroscope
and
spectrum
analysis
and
thence
fraunhofer
discovery
that
the
spectrum
of
an
ignited
gaseous
body
is
with
interrupting
lines
and
draper
discovery
that
the
spectrum
of
an
ignited
solid
is
continuous
with
no
interrupting
lines
and
now
the
spectroscope
was
turned
upon
the
nebula
and
many
of
them
were
found
to
be
gaseous
here
then
was
ground
for
the
inference
that
in
these
nebulous
masses
at
different
stages
of
condensation
some
apparently
mere
pitches
of
mist
some
with
luminous
centres
we
have
the
process
of
development
actually
going
on
and
observations
like
those
of
lord
rosse
and
arrest
gave
yet
further
confirmation
to
this
view
then
came
the
great
contribution
of
the
nineteenth
century
to
physics
aiding
to
explain
important
parts
of
the
vast
process
by
the
mechanical
theory
of
heat
again
the
nebular
hypothesis
came
forth
stronger
than
ever
and
about
the
beautiful
experiment
of
plateau
on
the
rotation
of
a
fluid
globe
came
in
apparently
to
illustrate
if
not
to
confirm
it
even
so
determined
a
defender
of
orthodoxy
as
gladstone
at
last
acknowledged
some
form
of
a
nebular
hypothesis
as
probably
true
here
too
was
exhibited
that
form
of
surrendering
theological
views
to
science
under
the
claim
that
science
concurs
with
theology
which
we
have
seen
in
so
many
other
fields
and
as
typical
an
example
may
be
given
which
however
restricted
in
its
scope
throws
light
on
the
process
by
which
such
surrenders
are
obtained
a
few
years
since
one
of
the
most
noted
professors
of
chemistry
in
the
city
of
new
york
under
the
auspices
of
one
of
its
most
fashionable
churches
gave
a
lecture
which
as
was
claimed
in
the
public
prints
and
in
placards
posted
in
the
streets
was
to
show
that
science
supports
the
theory
of
creation
given
in
the
sacred
books
ascribed
to
moses
a
large
audience
assembled
and
a
brilliant
series
of
elementary
experiments
with
oxygen
hydrogen
and
carbonic
acid
was
concluded
by
the
plateau
demonstration
it
was
beautifully
made
as
the
coloured
globule
of
oil
representing
the
earth
was
revolved
in
a
transparent
medium
of
equal
density
as
it
became
flattened
at
the
poles
as
rings
then
broke
forth
from
it
and
revolved
about
it
and
finally
as
some
of
these
rings
broke
into
satellites
which
for
a
moment
continued
to
circle
about
the
central
mass
the
audience
as
well
they
might
rose
and
burst
into
rapturous
applause
thereupon
a
citizen
arose
and
moved
the
thanks
of
the
audience
to
the
eminent
professor
for
this
perfect
demonstration
of
the
exact
and
literal
conformity
of
the
statements
given
in
holy
scripture
with
the
latest
results
of
science
the
motion
was
carried
unanimously
and
with
applause
and
the
audience
dispersed
feeling
that
a
great
service
had
been
rendered
to
orthodoxy
sancta
simplicitas
what
this
incident
exhibited
on
a
small
scale
has
been
seen
elsewhere
with
more
distinguished
actors
and
on
a
broader
stage
scores
of
theologians
chief
among
whom
of
late
in
zeal
if
not
in
knowledge
has
been
gladstone
have
endeavoured
to
reconcile
the
two
accounts
in
genesis
with
each
other
and
with
the
truths
regarding
the
origin
of
the
universe
gained
by
astronomy
geology
geography
physics
and
chemistry
the
result
has
been
recently
stated
by
an
eminent
theologian
the
hulsean
professor
of
divinity
at
the
university
of
cambridge
he
declares
no
attempt
at
reconciling
genesis
with
the
exacting
requirements
of
modern
sciences
has
ever
been
known
to
succeed
without
entailing
a
degree
of
special
pleading
or
forced
interpretation
to
which
in
such
a
question
we
should
be
wise

at
rest
first

come
the
biblical
critics
earnest
christian
scholars
working
for
the
sake

and
these
have
revealed
beyond
the
shadow
of
a
reasonable
doubt
the
existence
of
at
least
two
distinct
accounts
of
creation
in
our
book
of
genesis
which
can
sometimes
be
forced
to
agree
but
which
are
generally
absolutely
at
variance
with
each
other
these
scholars
have
further
shown
the
two
accounts
to
be
not
the
cunningly
devised
fables
of
priestcraft
but
evidently
fragments
of
earlier
legends
myths
and
theologies
accepted
in
good
faith
and
brought
together
for
the
noblest
of
purposes
by
those
who
put
in
order
the
first
of
our
sacred
books
next
have
come
the
archaeologists
and
philologists
the
devoted
students
of
ancient
monuments
and
records
of
these
are
such
as
rawlinson
george
smith
sayce
oppert
jensen
schrader
delitzsch
and
a
phalanx
of
similarly
devoted
scholars
who
have
deciphered
a
multitude
of
ancient
texts
especially
the
inscriptions
found
in
the
great
library
of
assurbanipal
at
nineveh
and
have
discovered
therein
an
account
of
the
origin
of
the
world
identical
in
its
most
important
features
with
the
later
accounts
in
our
own
book
of
genesis
these
men
have
had
the
courage
to
point
out
these
facts
and
to
connect
them
with
the
truth
that
these
chaldean
and
babylonian
myths
legends
and
theories
were
far
earlier
than
those
of
the
hebrews
which
so
strikingly
resemble
them
and
which
we
have
in
our
sacred
books
and
they
have
also
shown
us
how
natural
it
was
that
the
jewish
accounts
of
the
creation
should
have
been
obtained
at
that
remote
period
when
the
earliest
hebrews
were
among
the
chaldeans
and
how
the
great
hebrew
poetic
accounts
of
creation
were
drawn
either
from
the
sacred
traditions
of
these
earlier
peoples
or
from
antecedent
sources
common
to
various
ancient
nations
in
a
summary
which
for
profound
thought
and
fearless
integrity
does
honour
not
only
to
himself
but
to
the
great
position
which
he
holds
the
rev
driver
professor
of
hebrew
and
canon
of
christ
church
at
oxford
has
recently
stated
the
case
fully
and
fairly
having
pointed
out
the
fact
that
the
hebrews
were
one
people
out
of
many
who
thought
upon
the
origin
of
the
universe
he
says
that
they
framed
theories
to
account
for
the
beginnings
of
the
earth
and
man
that
they
either
did
this
for
themselves
or
borrowed
those
of
their
neighbours
that
of
the
theories
current
in
assyria
and
phoenicia
fragments
have
been
preserved
and
these
exhibit
points
of
resemblance
with
the
biblical
narrative
sufficient
to
warrant
the
inference
that
both
are
derived
from
the
same
cycle
of
tradition
after
giving
some
extracts
from
the
chaldean
creation
tablets
he
says
in
the
light
of
these
facts
it
is
difficult
to
resist
the
conclusion
that
the
biblical
narrative
is
drawn
from
the
same
source
as
these
other
records
the
biblical
historians
it
is
plain
derived
their
materials
from
the
best
human
sources
available
the
materials
which
with
other
nations
were
combined
into
the
crudest
physical
theories
or
associated
with
a
grotesque
polytheism
were
vivified
and
transformed
by
the
inspired
genius
of
the
hebrew
historians
and
adapted
to
become
the
vehicle
of
profound
religious
truth
not
less
honourable
to
the
sister
university
and
to
himself
is
the
statement
recently
made
by
the
rev
ryle
hulsean
professor
of
divinity
at
cambridge
he
says
that
to
suppose
that
a
christian
must
either
renounce
his
confidence
in
the
achievements
of
scientific
research
or
abandon
his
faith
in
scripture
is
a
monstrous
perversion
of
christian
freedom
he
declares
the
old
position
is
no
longer
tenable
a
new
position
has
to
be
taken
up
at
once
prayerfully
chosen
and
hopefully
held
he
then
goes
on
to
compare
the
hebrew
story
of
creation
with
the
earlier
stories
developed
among
kindred
peoples
and
especially
with
the
cosmogony
and
shows
that
they
are
from
the
same
source
he
points
out
that
any
attempt
to
explain
particular
features
of
the
story
into
harmony
with
the
modern
scientific
ideas
necessitates
a
interpretation
but
he
says
that
if
we
adopt
a
natural
interpretation
we
shall
consider
that
the
hebrew
description
of
the
visible
universe
is
unscientific
as
judged
by
modern
standards
and
that
it
shares
the
limitations
of
the
imperfect
knowledge
of
the
age
at
which
it
was
committed
to
writing
regarding
the
account
in
genesis
of
man
physical
origin
he
says
that
it
is
expressed
in
the
simple
terms
of
prehistoric
legend
of
unscientific
pictorial
description
in
these
statements
and
in
a
multitude
of
others
made
by
eminent
christian
investigators
in
other
countries
is
indicated
what
the
victory
is
which
has
now
been
fully
won
over
the
older
theology
thus
from
the
assyrian
researches
as
well
as
from
other
sources
it
has
come
to
be
acknowledged
by
the
most
eminent
scholars
at
the
leading
seats
of
christian
learning
that
the
accounts
of
creation
with
which
for
nearly
two
thousand
years
all
scientific
discoveries
have
had
to
be
reconciled
the
accounts
which
blocked
the
way
of
copernicus
and
galileo
and
newton
and
laplace
were
simply
transcribed
or
evolved
from
a
mass
of
myths
and
legends
largely
derived
by
the
hebrews
from
their
ancient
relations
with
chaldea
rewrought
in
a
monotheistic
sense
imperfectly
welded
together
and
then
thrown
into
poetic
forms
in
the
sacred
books
which
we
have
inherited
on
one
hand
then
we
have
the
various
groups
of
men
devoted
to
the
physical
sciences
all
converging
toward
the
proofs
that
the
universe
as
we
at
present
know
it
is
the
result
of
an
evolutionary
process
that
is
of
the
gradual
working
of
physical
laws
upon
an
early
condition
of
matter
on
the
other
hand
we
have
other
great
groups
of
men
devoted
to
historical
philological
and
archaeological
science
whose
researches
all
converge
toward
the
conclusion
that
our
sacred
accounts
of
creation
were
the
result
of
an
evolution
from
an
early
chaos
of
rude
opinion
the
great
body
of
theologians
who
have
so
long
resisted
the
conclusions
of
the
men
of
science
have
claimed
to
be
fighting
especially
for
the
truth
of
scripture
and
their
final
answer
to
the
simple
conclusions
of
science
regarding
the
evolution
of
the
material
universe
has
been
the
cry
the
bible
is
true
and
they
are
right
though
in
a
sense
nobler
than
they
have
dreamed
science
while
conquering
them
has
found
in
our
scriptures
a
far
nobler
truth
than
that
literal
historical
exactness
for
which
theologians
have
so
long
and
so
vainly
contended
more
and
more
as
we
consider
the
results
of
the
long
struggle
in
this
field
we
are
brought
to
the
conclusion
that
the
inestimable
value
of
the
great
sacred
books
of
the
world
is
found
in
their
revelation
of
the
steady
striving
of
our
race
after
higher
conceptions
beliefs
and
aspirations
both
in
morals
and
religion
unfolding
and
exhibiting
this
effort
each
of
the
great
sacred
books
of
the
world
is
precious
and
all
in
the
highest
sense
are
true
not
one
of
them
indeed
conforms
to
the
measure
of
what
mankind
has
now
reached
in
historical
and
scientific
truth
to
make
a
claim
to
such
conformity
is
folly
for
it
simply
exposes
those
who
make
it
and
the
books
for
which
it
is
made
to
loss
of
their
just
influence
that
to
which
the
great
sacred
books
of
the
world
conform
and
our
own
most
of
all
is
the
evolution
of
the
highest
conceptions
beliefs
and
aspirations
of
our
race
from
its
childhood
through
the
great
in
its
history
herein
lies
the
truth
of
all
bibles
and
especially
of
our
own
of
vast
value
they
indeed
often
are
as
a
record
of
historical
outward
fact
recent
researches
in
the
east
are
constantly
increasing
this
value
but
it
is
not
for
this
that
we
prize
them
most
they
are
eminently
precious
not
as
a
record
of
outward
fact
but
as
a
mirror
of
the
evolving
heart
mind
and
soul
of
man
they
are
true
because
they
have
been
developed
in
accordance
with
the
laws
governing
the
evolution
of
truth
in
human
history
and
because
in
poem
chronicle
code
legend
myth
apologue
or
parable
they
reflect
this
development
of
what
is
best
in
the
onward
march
of
humanity
to
say
that
they
are
not
true
is
as
if
one
should
say
that
a
flower
or
a
tree
or
a
planet
is
not
true
to
scoff
at
them
is
to
scoff
at
the
law
of
the
universe
in
welding
together
into
noble
form
whether
in
the
book
of
genesis
or
in
the
psalms
or
in
the
book
of
job
or
elsewhere
the
great
conceptions
of
men
acting
under
earlier
inspiration
whether
in
egypt
or
chaldea
or
india
or
persia
the
compilers
of
our
sacred
books
have
given
to
humanity
a
possession
ever
becoming
more
and
more
precious
and
modern
science
in
substituting
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
for
the
old
the
reign
of
law
for
the
reign
of
caprice
and
the
idea
of
evolution
for
that
of
creation
has
added
and
is
steadily
adding
a
new
revelation
divinely
inspired
in
the
light
of
these
two
evolutions
then
one
of
the
visible
universe
the
other
of
a
sacred
science
and
theology
if
the
master
minds
in
both
are
wise
may
at
last
be
reconciled
a
great
step
in
this
reconciliation
was
recently
seen
at
the
main
centre
of
theological
thought
among
people
when
in
the
collection
of
essays
entitled
lux
mundi
emanating
from
the
college
established
in
these
latter
days
as
a
fortress
of
orthodoxy
at
oxford
the
legendary
character
of
the
creation
accounts
in
our
sacred
books
was
acknowledged
and
when
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
asked
may
not
the
holy
spirit
at
times
have
made
use
of
myth
and
legend
for
the
first

for
evidence
that
even
the
stiffest
of
scotch
presbyterians
have
come
to
discard
the
old
literal
biblical
narrative
of
creation
and
to
regard
the
declaration
of
the
westminster
confession
thereon
as
a
disproved
theory
of

side

this
view
of
the

creation
had
come
from
far
appearing
under
varying
forms
in
various
ancient
cosmogonies

work
is
ascribed
in

assyrian
tablets
to
the
gods

babylonia
passing
into

own
sacred
books
these
ideas
became
the
starting

the
fathers
of
the
church
generally
received
each
of
the
two
conflicting
creation
legends
in
genesis
literally
and
then
having
done
their
best
to
reconcile
them
with
each
other
and
to
mould
them
together
made
them
the
final
test
of
thought
upon
the
universe
and
all
things
therein
at
the
beginning
of
the
fourth
century
lactantius
struck
the
of
this
mode
of
subordinating
all
other
things
in
the
study
of
creation
to
the
literal
text
of
scripture
and
he
enforces
his
view
of
the
creation
of
man
by
a
bit
of
philology
saying
the
final
being
created
is
called
man
because
he
is
made
from
the
ground
homo
ex
humo
in
the
second
half
of
the
same
century
this
view
as
to
the
literal
acceptance
of
the
sacred
text
was
reasserted
by
ambrose
who
in
his
work
on
the
creation
declared
that
moses
opened
his
mouth
and
poured
forth
what
god
had
said
to
him
but
a
greater
than
either
of
them
fastened
this
idea
into
the
christian
theologies
augustine
preparing
his
commentary
on
the
book
of
genesis
laid
down
in
one
famous
sentence
the
law
which
has
lasted
in
the
church
until
our
own
time
nothing
is
to
be
accepted
save
on
the
authority
of
scripture
since
greater
is
that
authority
than
all
the
powers
of
the
human
mind
the
vigour
of
the
sentence
in
its
original
latin
carried
it
ringing
down
the
centuries
major
est
scripturae
auctoritas
quam
omnis
humani
ingenii
capacitas
through
the
mediaeval
period
in
spite
of
a
revolt
led
by
no
other
than
augustine
himself
and
followed
by
a
series
of
influential
churchmen
contending
as
we
shall
hereafter
see
for
a
modification
of
the
accepted
view
of
creation
this
phrase
held
the
minds
of
men
firmly
the
great
dominican
encyclopaedist
vincent
of
beauvais
in
his
mirror
of
nature
while
mixing
ideas
brought
from
aristotle
with
a
theory
drawn
from
the
bible
stood
firmly
by
the
first
of
the
accounts
given
in
genesis
and
assigned
the
special
virtue
of
the
number
six
as
a
reason
why
all
things
were
created
in
six
days
and
in
the
later
middle
ages
that
eminent
authority
cardinal
d
ailly
accepted
everything
regarding
creation
in
the
sacred
books
literally
only
a
faint
dissent
is
seen
in
gregory
reisch
another
authority
of
this
later
period
who
while
giving
in
his
book
on
the
beginning
of
things
a
full
length
woodcut
showing
the
almighty
in
the
act
of
extracting
eve
from
adam
side
with
all
the
rest
of
nature
in
the
background
leans
in
his
writings
like
augustine
toward
a
belief
in
the
of
matter
at
the
reformation
the
vast
authority
of
luther
was
thrown
in
favour
of
the
literal
acceptance
of
scripture
as
the
main
source
of
natural
science
the
allegorical
and
mystical
interpretations
of
earlier
theologians
he
utterly
rejected
why
he
asks
should
moses
use
allegory
when
he
is
not
speaking
of
allegorical
creatures
or
of
an
allegorical
world
but
of
real
creatures
and
of
a
visible
world
which
can
be
seen
felt
and
grasped
moses
calls
things
by
their
right
names
as
we
ought
to
do
i
hold
that
the
animals
took
their
being
at
once
upon
the
word
of
god
as
did
also
the
fishes
in
the
sea
not
less
explicit
in
his
adherence
to
the
literal
account
of
creation
given
in
genesis
was
calvin
he
warns
those
who
by
taking
another
view
than
his
own
basely
insult
the
creator
to
expect
a
judge
who
will
annihilate
them
he
insists
that
all
species
of
animals
were
created
in
six
days
each
made
up
of
an
evening
and
a
morning
and
that
no
new
species
has
ever
appeared
since
he
dwells
on
the
production
of
birds
from
the
water
as
resting
upon
certain
warrant
of
scripture
but
adds
if
the
question
is
to
be
argued
on
physical
grounds
we
know
that
water
is
more
akin
to
air
than
the
earth
is
as
to
difficulties
in
the
scriptural
account
of
creation
he
tells
us
that
god
wished
by
these
to
give
proofs
of
his
power
which
should
fill
us
with
astonishment
the
controlling
minds
in
the
roman
church
steadfastly
held
this
view
in
the
seventeenth
century
bossuet
threw
his
vast
authority
in
its
favour
and
in
his
discourse
on
universal
history
which
has
remained
the
foundation
not
only
of
theological
but
of
general
historical
teaching
in
france
down
to
the
present
republic
we
find
him
calling
attention
to
what
he
regards
as
the
culminating
act
of
creation
and
asserting
that
literally
for
the
creation
of
man
earth
was
used
and
the
finger
of
god
applied
to
corruptible
matter
the
protestant
world
held
this
idea
no
less
persistently
in
the
seventeenth
century
john
lightfoot
of
the
university
of
cambridge
the
great
rabbinical
scholar
of
his
time
attempted
to
reconcile
the
two
main
legends
in
genesis
by
saying
that
of
the
clean
sort
of
beasts
there
were
seven
of
every
kind
created
three
couples
for
breeding
and
the
odd
one
for
adam
sacrifice
on
his
fall
which
god
foresaw
and
that
of
unclean
beasts
only
one
couple
was
created
so
literal
was
this
whole
conception
of
the
work
of
creation
that
in
these
days
it
can
scarcely
be
imagined
the
almighty
was
represented
in
theological
literature
in
the
pictured
bibles
and
in
works
of
art
generally
as
a
sort
of
enlarged
and
venerable
nuremberg
toymaker
at
times
the
accounts
in
genesis
were
illustrated
with
even
more
literal
exactness
thus
in
connection
with
a
passage
in
the
sacred
text
the
creator
was
shown
as
a
tailor
seated
needle
in
hand
diligently
sewing
together
skins
of
beasts
into
coats
for
adam
and
eve
such
representations
presented
no
difficulties
to
the
docile
minds
of
the
middle
ages
and
the
reformation
period
and
in
the
same
spirit
when
the
discovery
of
fossils
began
to
provoke
thought
these
were
declared
to
be
models
of
his
works
approved
or
rejected
by
the
great
artificer
outlines
of
future
creations
sports
of
nature
or
objects
placed
in
the
strata
to
bring
to
naught
human
curiosity
and
this
kind
of
explanation
lingered
on
until
in
our
own
time
an
eminent
naturalist
in
his
anxiety
to
save
the
literal
account
in
genesis
has
urged
that
jehovah
tilted
and
twisted
the
strata
scattered
the
fossils
through
them
scratched
the
glacial
furrows
upon
them
spread
over
them
the
marks
of
erosion
by
water
and
set
niagara
pouring
all
in
an
instant

mystifying
the
world

the
next
important
development
of
theological
reasoning
had
regard
to
the
divisions
of
the
animal
kingdom
naturally
one
of
the
first
divisions
which
struck
the
inquiring
mind
was
that
between
useful
and
noxious
creatures
and
the
question
therefore
occurred
how
could
a
good
god
create
tigers
and
serpents
thorns
and
thistles
the
answer
was
found
in
theological
considerations
upon
sin
to
man
first
disobedience
all
woes
were
due
great
men
for
eighteen
hundred
years
developed
the
theory
that
before
disobedience
there
was
no
death
and
therefore
neither
ferocity
nor
venom
some
typical
utterances
in
the
evolution
of
this
doctrine
are
worthy
of
a
passing
glance
augustine
expressly
confirmed
and
emphasized
the
view
that
the
vegetable
as
well
as
the
animal
kingdom
was
cursed
on
account
of
man
sin
two
hundred
years
later
this
utterance
had
been
echoed
on
from
father
to
father
of
the
church
until
it
was
caught
by
bede
he
declared
that
before
man
fall
animals
were
harmless
but
were
made
poisonous
or
hurtful
by
adam
sin
and
he
said
thus
fierce
and
poisonous
animals
were
created
for
terrifying
man
because
god
foresaw
that
he
would
sin
in
order
that
he
might
be
made
aware
of
the
final
punishment
of
hell
in
the
twelfth
century
this
view
was
incorporated
by
peter
lombard
into
his
great
theological
work
the
sentences
which
became
a
of
theology
through
the
middle
ages
he
affirmed
that
no
created
things
would
have
been
hurtful
to
man
had
he
not
sinned
they
became
hurtful
for
the
sake
of
terrifying
and
punishing
vice
or
of
proving
and
perfecting
virtue
they
were
created
harmless
and
on
account
of
sin
became
hurtful
this
theological
theory
regarding
animals
was
brought
out
in
the
eighteenth
century
with
great
force
by
john
wesley
he
declared
that
before
adam
sin
none
of
these
attempted
to
devour
or
in
any
wise
hurt
one
another
the
spider
was
as
harmless
as
the
fly
and
did
not
lie
in
wait
for
blood
not
only
wesley
but
the
eminent
adam
clarke
and
richard
watson
whose
ideas
had
the
very
greatest
weight
among
the
english
dissenters
and
even
among
leading
thinkers
in
the
established
church
held
firmly
to
this
theory
so
that
not
until
in
our
own
time
geology
revealed
the
remains
of
vast
multitudes
of
carnivorous
creatures
many
of
them
with
remains
of
other
animals
in
their
stomachs
all
extinct
long
ages
before
the
appearance
of
man
upon
earth
was
a
victory
won
by
science
over
theology
in
this
field
a
curious
development
of
this
doctrine
was
seen
in
the
belief
drawn
by
sundry
old
commentators
from
the
condemnation
of
the
serpent
in
genesis
a
belief
indeed
perfectly
natural
since
it
was
evidently
that
of
the
original
writers
of
the
account
preserved
in
the
first
of
our
sacred
books
this
belief
was
that
until
the
tempting
serpent
was
cursed
by
the
almighty
all
serpents
stood
erect
walked
and
talked
this
belief
was
handed
down
the
ages
as
part
of
the
sacred
deposit
of
the
faith
until
watson
the
most
prolific
writer
of
the
evangelical
reform
in
the
eighteenth
century
and
the
standard
theologian
of
the
evangelical
party
declared
we
have
no
reason
at
all
to
believe
that
the
animal
had
a
serpentine
form
in
any
mode
or
degree
until
its
transformation
that
he
was
then
degraded
to
a
reptile
to
go
upon
his
belly
imports
on
the
contrary
an
entire
loss
and
alteration
of
the
original
form
here
again
was
a
ripe
result
of
the
theologic
method
diligently
pursued
by
the
strongest
thinkers
in
the
church
during
nearly
two
thousand
years
but
this
sacred
deposit
also
faded
away
when
the
geologists
found
abundant
remains
of
fossil
serpents
dating
from
periods
long
before
the
appearance
of
man
troublesome
questions
also
arose
among
theologians
regarding
animals
classed
as
superfluous
augustine
was
especially
exercised
thereby
he
says
i
confess
i
am
ignorant
why
mice
and
frogs
were
created
or
flies
and
worms
all
creatures
are
either
useful
hurtful
or
superfluous
to
us
as
for
the
hurtful
creatures
we
are
either
punished
or
disciplined
or
terrified
by
them
so
that
we
may
not
cherish
and
love
this
life
as
to
the
superfluous
animals
he
says
although
they
are
not
necessary
for
our
service
yet
the
whole
design
of
the
universe
is
thereby
completed
and
finished
luther
who
followed
augustine
in
so
many
other
matters
declined
to
follow
him
fully
in
this
to
him
a
fly
was
not
merely
superfluous
it
was
noxious
sent
by
the
devil
to
vex
him
when
reading
another
subject
which
gave
rise
to
much
searching
of
scripture
and
long
trains
of
theological
reasoning
was
the
difference
between
the
creation
of
man
and
that
of
other
living
beings
great
stress
was
laid
by
theologians
from
st
basil
and
augustine
to
thomas
aquinas
and
bossuet
and
from
luther
to
wesley
on
the
radical
distinction
indicated
in
genesis
god
having
created
man
in
his
own
image
what
this
statement
meant
was
seen
in
the
light
of
the
later
biblical
statement
that
adam
begat
seth
in
his
own
likeness
after
his
image
in
view
of
this
and
of
texts
incorporated
from
older
creation
legends
into
the
hebrew
sacred
books
it
came
to
be
widely
held
that
while
man
was
directly
moulded
and
fashioned
separately
by
the
hand
the
animals
generally
were
evoked
in
numbers
from
the
earth
and
sea
by
the
creator
voice
a
question
now
arose
naturally
as
to
the
distinctions
of
species
among
animals
the
vast
majority
of
theologians
agreed
in
representing
all
animals
as
created
in
the
beginning
and
named
by
adam
preserved
in
the
ark
and
continued
ever
afterward
under
exactly
the
same
species
this
belief
ripened
into
a
dogma
like
so
many
other
dogmas
in
the
church
catholic
and
protestant
its
real
origins
are
to
be
found
rather
in
pagan
philosophy
than
in
the
christian
scriptures
it
came
far
more
from
plato
and
aristotle
than
from
moses
and
paul
but
this
was
not
considered
more
and
more
it
became
necessary
to
believe
that
each
and
every
difference
of
species
was
impressed
by
the
creator
in
the
beginning
and
that
no
change
had
taken
place
or
could
have
taken
place
since
some
difficulties
arose
here
and
there
as
zoology
progressed
and
revealed
numbers
of
species
but
through
the
middle
ages
and
indeed
long
after
the
reformation
these
difficulties
were
easily
surmounted
by
making
the
ark
of
noah
larger
and
larger
and
especially
by
holding
that
there
had
been
a
human
error

regard
to
its
measurement

see

and
note
also
but
naturally
there
was
developed
among
both
ecclesiastics
and
laymen
a
human
desire
to
go
beyond
these
special
points
in
the
history
of
animated
beings
a
desire
to
know
what
the
creation
really
is
current
legends
stories
and
travellers
observations
poor
as
they
were
tended
powerfully
to
stimulate
curiosity
in
this
field
three
centuries
before
the
christian
era
aristotle
had
made
the
first
really
great
attempt
to
satisfy
this
curiosity
and
had
begun
a
development
of
studies
in
natural
history
which
remains
one
of
the
leading
achievements
in
the
story
of
our
race
but
the
feeling
which
we
have
already
seen
so
strong
in
the
early
church
that
all
study
of
nature
was
futile
in
view
of
the
approaching
end
of
the
world
indicated
so
clearly
in
the
new
testament
and
voiced
so
powerfully
by
lactantius
and
augustine
held
back
this
current
of
thought
for
many
centuries
still
the
better
tendency
in
humanity
continued
to
assert
itself
there
was
indeed
an
influence
coming
from
the
hebrew
scriptures
themselves
which
wrought
powerfully
to
this
end
for
in
spite
of
all
that
lactantius
or
augustine
might
say
as
to
the
futility
of
any
study
of
nature
the
grand
utterances
in
the
psalms
regarding
the
beauties
and
wonders
of
creation
in
all
the
glow
of
the
truest
poetry
ennobled
the
study
even
among
those
whom
logic
drew
away
from
it
but
as
a
matter
of
course
in
the
early
church
and
throughout
the
middle
ages
all
such
studies
were
cast
in
a
theologic
mould
without
some
purpose
of
biblical
illustration
or
spiritual
edification
they
were
considered
futile
too
much
prying
into
the
secrets
of
nature
was
very
generally
held
to
be
dangerous
both
to
body
and
soul
only
for
showing
forth
god
glory
and
his
purposes
in
the
creation
were
such
studies
praiseworthy
the
great
work
of
aristotle
was
under
eclipse
the
early
christian
thinkers
gave
little
attention
to
it
and
that
little
was
devoted
to
transforming
it
into
something
absolutely
opposed
to
his
whole
spirit
and
method
in
place
of
it
they
developed
the
physiologus
and
the
bestiaries
mingling
scriptural
statements
legends
of
the
saints
and
fanciful
inventions
with
pious
intent
and
childlike
simplicity
in
place
of
research
came
authority
the
authority
of
the
scriptures
as
interpreted
by
the
physio
cogus
and
the
bestiaries
and
these
remained
the
principal
source
of
thought
on
animated
nature
for
over
a
thousand
years
occasionally
indeed
fear
was
shown
among
the
rulers
in
the
church
even
at
such
poor
prying
into
the
creation
as
this
and
in
the
fifth
century
a
synod
under
pope
gelasius
administered
a
rebuke
to
the
physiologus
but
the
interest
in
nature
was
too
strong
the
great
work
on
creation
by
st
basil
had
drawn
from
the
physiologus
precious
illustrations
of
holy
writ
and
the
strongest
of
the
early
popes
gregory
the
great
virtually
sanctioned
it
thus
was
developed
a
sacred
science
of
creation
and
of
the
divine
purpose
in
nature
which
went
on
developing
from
the
fourth
century
to
the
nineteenth
from
st
basil
to
isidore
of
seville
from
isidore
to
vincent
of
beauvais
and
from
vincent
to
archdeacon
paley
and
the
bridgewater
treatises
like
all
else
in
the
middle
ages
this
sacred
science
was
developed
purely
by
theological
methods
neglecting
the
wonders
which
the
dissection
of
the
commonest
animals
would
have
afforded
them
these
naturalists
attempted
to
throw
light
into
nature
by
ingenious
use
of
scriptural
texts
by
research
among
the
lives
of
the
saints
and
by
the
plentiful
application
of
metaphysics
hence
even
such
strong
men
as
isidore
of
seville
treasured
up
accounts
of
the
unicorn
and
dragons
mentioned
in
the
scriptures
and
of
the
phoenix
and
basilisk
in
profane
writings
hence
such
contributions
to
knowledge
as
that
the
basilisk
kills
serpents
by
his
breath
and
men
by
his
glance
that
the
lion
when
pursued
effaces
his
tracks
with
the
end
of
his
tail
that
the
pelican
nourishes
her
young
with
her
own
blood
that
serpents
lay
aside
their
venom
before
drinking
that
the
salamander
quenches
fire
that
the
hyena
can
talk
with
shepherds
that
certain
birds
are
born
of
the
fruit
of
a
certain
tree
when
it
happens
to
fall
into
the
water
with
other
masses
of
science
equally
valuable
as
to
the
method
of
bringing
science
to
bear
on
scripture
the
physiologus
gives
an
example
illustrating
the
passage
in
the
book
of
job
which
speaks
of
the
old
lion
perishing
for
lack
of
prey
out
of
the
attempt
to
explain
an
unusual
hebrew
word
in
the
text
there
came
a
curious
development
of
error
until
we
find
fully
evolved
an
account
of
the
which
it
gives
us
to
understand
was
the
lion
mentioned
by
job
and
it
says
as
to
the
his
father
hath
the
shape
of
a
lion
his
mother
that
of
an
ant
the
father
liveth
upon
flesh
and
the
mother
upon
herbs
these
bring
forth
the
a
compound
of
both
and
in
part
like
to
either
for
his
fore
part
is
like
that
of
a
lion
and
his
hind
part
like
that
of
an
ant
being
thus
composed
he
is
neither
able
to
eat
flesh
like
his
father
nor
herbs
like
his
mother
and
so
he
perisheth
in
the
middle
of
the
thirteenth
century
we
have
a
triumph
of
this
theological
method
in
the
great
work
of
the
english
franciscan
bartholomew
on
the
properties
of
things
the
theological
method
as
applied
to
science
consists
largely
in
accepting
tradition
and
in
spinning
arguments
to
fit
it
in
this
field
bartholomew
was
a
master
having
begun
with
the
intent
mainly
to
explain
the
allusions
in
scripture
to
natural
objects
he
soon
rises
logically
into
a
survey
of
all
nature
discussing
the
cockatrice
of
scripture
he
tells
us
he
drieth
and
burneth
leaves
with
his
touch
and
he
is
of
so
great
venom
and
perilous
that
he
slayeth
and
wasteth
him
that
nigheth
him
without
tarrying
and
yet
the
weasel
overcometh
him
for
the
biting
of
the
weasel
is
death
to
the
cockatrice
nevertheless
the
biting
of
the
cockatrice
is
death
to
the
weasel
if
the
weasel
eat
not
rue
before
and
though
the
cockatrice
be
venomous
without
remedy
while
he
is
alive
yet
he
looseth
all
the
malice
when
he
is
burnt
to
ashes
his
ashes
be
accounted
profitable
in
working
of
alchemy
and
namely
in
turning
and
changing
of
metals
bartholomew
also
enlightens
us
on
the
animals
of
egypt
and
says
if
the
crocodile
findeth
a
man
by
the
water
brim
he
slayeth
him
and
then
he
weepeth
over
him
and
swalloweth
him
naturally
this
good
franciscan
naturalist
devotes
much
thought
to
the
dragons
mentioned
in
scripture
he
says
the
dragon
is
most
greatest
of
all
serpents
and
oft
he
is
drawn
out
of
his
den
and
riseth
up
into
the
air
and
the
air
is
moved
by
him
and
also
the
sea
swelleth
against
his
venom
and
he
hath
a
crest
and
reareth
his
tongue
and
hath
teeth
like
a
saw
and
hath
strength
and
not
only
in
teeth
but
in
tail
and
grieveth
with
biting
and
with
stinging
whom
he
findeth
he
slayeth
oft
four
or
five
of
them
fasten
their
tails
together
and
rear
up
their
heads
and
sail
over
the
sea
to
get
good
meat
between
elephants
and
dragons
is
everlasting
fighting
for
the
dragon
with
his
tail
spanneth
the
elephant
and
the
elephant
with
his
nose
throweth
down
the
dragon
the
cause
why
the
dragon
desireth
his
blood
is
the
coldness
thereof
by
the
which
the
dragon
desireth
to
cool
himself
jerome
saith
that
the
dragon
is
a
full
thirsty
beast
insomuch
that
he
openeth
his
mouth
against
the
wind
to
quench
the
burning
of
his
thirst
in
that
wise
therefore
when
he
seeth
ships
in
great
wind
he
flieth
against
the
sail
to
take
the
cold
wind
and
overthroweth
the
ship
these
ideas
of
friar
bartholomew
spread
far
and
struck
deep
into
the
popular
mind
his
book
was
translated
into
the
principal
languages
of
europe
and
was
one
of
those
most
generally
read
during
the
ages
of
faith
it
maintained
its
position
nearly
three
hundred
years
even
after
the
invention
of
printing
it
held
its
own
and
in
the
fifteenth
century
there
were
issued
no
less
than
ten
editions
of
it
in
latin
four
in
french
and
various
versions
of
it
in
dutch
spanish
and
english
preachers
found
it
especially
useful
in
illustrating
the
ways
of
god
to
man
it
was
only
when
the
great
voyages
of
discovery
substituted
ascertained
fact
for
theological
reasoning
in
this
province
that
its
authority
was
broken
the
same
sort
of
science
flourished
in
the
bestiaries
which
were
used
everywhere
and
especially
in
the
pulpits
for
the
edification
of
the
faithful
in
all
of
these
as
in
that
compiled
early
in
the
thirteenth
century
by
an
ecclesiastic
william
of
normandy
we
have
this
lesson
borrowed
from
the
physiologus
the
lioness
giveth
birth
to
cubs
which
remain
three
days
without
life
then
cometh
the
lion
breatheth
upon
them
and
bringeth
them
to
life
thus
it
is
that
jesus
christ
during
three
days
was
deprived
of
life
but
god
the
father
raised
him
gloriously
pious
use
was
constantly
made
of
this
science
especially
by
monkish
preachers
the
phoenix
rising
from
his
ashes
proves
the
doctrine
of
the
resurrection
the
structure
and
mischief
of
monkeys
proves
the
existence
of
demons
the
fact
that
certain
monkeys
have
no
tails
proves
that
satan
has
been
shorn
of
his
glory
the
weasel
which
constantly
changes
its
place
is
a
type
of
the
man
estranged
from
the
word
of
god
who
findeth
no
rest
the
moral
treatises
of
the
time
often
took
the
form
of
works
on
natural
history
in
order
the
more
fully
to
exploit
these
religious
teachings
of
nature
thus
from
the
book
on
bees
the
dominican
thomas
of
cantimpre
we
learn
that
wasps
persecute
bees
and
make
war
on
them
out
of
natural
hatred
and
these
he
tells
us
typify
the
demons
who
dwell
in
the
air
and
with
lightning
and
tempest
assail
and
vex
mankind
whereupon
he
fills
a
long
chapter
with
anecdotes
of
such
demonic
warfare
on
mortals
in
like
manner
his
the
inquisitor
nider
in
his
book
the
ant
hill
teaches
us
that
the
ants
in
ethiopia
which
are
said
to
have
horns
and
to
grow
so
large
as
to
look
like
dogs
are
emblems
of
atrocious
heretics
like
wyclif
and
the
hussites
who
bark
and
bite
against
the
truth
while
the
ants
of
india
which
dig
up
gold
out
of
the
sand
with
their
feet
and
hoard
it
though
they
make
no
use
of
it
symbolize
the
fruitless
toil
with
which
the
heretics
dig
out
the
gold
of
holy
scripture
and
hoard
it
in
their
books
to
no
purpose
this
pious
spirit
not
only
pervaded
science
it
bloomed
out
in
art
and
especially
in
the
cathedrals
in
the
gargoyles
overhanging
the
walls
in
the
grotesques
clambering
about
the
towers
or
perched
upon
pinnacles
in
the
dragons
prowling
under
archways
or
lurking
in
bosses
of
foliage
in
the
apocalyptic
beasts
carved
upon
the
stalls
of
the
choir
stained
into
the
windows
wrought
into
the
tapestries
illuminated

abd
allatif
made
observations
upon
the
natural
history
of
egypt
which
showed
a
truly
scientific
spirit
and
the
emperor
frederick
ii
attempted
to
promote
a
more
fruitful
study
of
nature
but
one
of
these
men
was
abhorred
as
a
mussulman
and
the
other
as
an
infidel
far
more
in
accordance
with
the
spirit
of
the
time
was
the
ecclesiastic
giraldus
cambrensis
whose
book
on
the
topography
of
ireland
bestows
much
attention
upon
the
animals
of
the
island
and
rarely
fails
to
make
each
contribute
an
appropriate
moral
for
example
he
says
that
in
ireland
eagles
live
for
so
many
ages
that
they
seem
to
contend
with
eternity
itself
so
also
the
saints
having
put
off
the
old
man
and
put
on
the
new
obtain
the
blessed
fruit
of
everlasting
life
again
he
tells
us
eagles
often
fly
so
high
that
their
wings
are
scorched
by
the
sun
so
those
who
in
the
holy
scriptures
strive
to
unravel
the
deep
and
hidden
secrets
of
the
heavenly
mysteries
beyond
what
is
allowed
fall
below
as
if
the
wings
of
the
presumptuous
imaginations
on
which
they
are
borne
were
scorched
in
one
of
the
great
men
of
the
following
century
appeared
a
gleam
of
healthful
criticism
albert
the
great
in
his
work
on
the
animals
dissents
from
the
widespread
belief
that
certain
birds
spring
from
trees
and
are
nourished
by
the
sap
and
also
from
the
theory
that
some
are
generated
in
the
sea
from
decaying
wood
but
it
required
many
generations
for
such
scepticism
to
produce
much
effect
and
we
find
among
the
illustrations
in
an
edition
of
mandeville
published
just
before
the
reformation
not
only
careful
accounts

this
general
employment
of
natural
science
for
pious
purposes
went
on
after
the
reformation
luther
frequently
made
this
use
of
it
and
his
example
controlled
his
followers
in
wolfgang
franz
professor
of
theology
at
luther
university
gave
to
the
world
his
sacred
history
of
animals
which
went
through
many
editions
it
contained
a
very
ingenious
classification
describing
natural
dragons
which
have
three
rows
of
teeth
to
each
jaw
and
he
piously
adds
the
principal
dragon
is
the
devil
near
the
end
of
the
same
century
father
kircher
the
great
jesuit
professor
at
rome
holds
back
the
sceptical
current
insists
upon
the
orthodox
view
and
represents
among
the
animals
entering
the
ark
sirens
and
griffins
yet
even
among
theologians
we
note
here
and
there
a
sceptical
spirit
in
natural
science
early
in
the
same
seventeenth
century
eugene
roger
published
his
travels
in
palestine
as
regards
the
utterances
of
scripture
he
is
soundly
orthodox
he
prefaces
his
work
with
a
map
showing
among
other
important
points
referred
to
in
biblical
history
the
place
where
samson
slew
a
thousand
philistines
with
the
jawbone
of
an
ass
the
cavern
which
adam
and
eve
inhabited
after
their
expulsion
from
paradise
the
spot
where
balaam
ass
spoke
the
place
where
jacob
wrestled
with
the
angel
the
steep
place
down
which
the
swine
possessed
of
devils
plunged
into
the
sea
the
position
of
the
salt
statue
which
was
once
lot
wife
the
place
at
sea
where
jonah
was
swallowed
by
the
whale
and
the
exact
spot
where
peter
caught
one
hundred
and
fishes
as
to
natural
history
he
describes
and
discusses
with
great
theological
acuteness
the
basilisk
he
tells
us
that
the
animal
is
about
a
foot
and
a
half
long
is
shaped
like
a
crocodile
and
kills
people
with
a
single
glance
the
one
which
he
saw
was
dead
fortunately
for
him
since
in
the
time
of
pope
leo
iv
as
he
tells
us
one
appeared
in
rome
and
killed
many
people
by
merely
looking
at
them
but
the
pope
destroyed
it
with
his
prayers
and
the
sign
of
the
cross
he
informs
us
that
providence
has
wisely
and
mercifully
protected
man
by
requiring
the
monster
to
cry
aloud
two
or
three
times
whenever
it
leaves
its
den
and
that
the
divine
wisdom
in
creation
is
also
shown
by
the
fact
that
the
monster
is
obliged
to
look
its
victim
in
the
eye
and
at
a
certain
fixed
distance
before
its
glance
can
penetrate
the
victim
brain
and
so
pass
to
his
heart
he
also
gives
a
reason
for
supposing
that
the
same
divine
mercy
has
provided
that
the
crowing
of
a
cock
will
kill
the
basilisk
yet
even
in
this
good
and
credulous
missionary
we
see
the
influence
of
bacon
and
the
dawn
of
experimental
science
for
having
been
told
many
stories
regarding
the
salamander
he
secured
one
placed
it
alive
upon
the
burning
coals
and
reports
to
us
that
the
legends
concerning
its
power
to
live
in
the
fire
are
untrue
he
also
tried
experiments
with
the
chameleon
and
found
that
the
stories
told
of
it
were
to
be
received
with
much
allowance
while
then
he
locks
up
his
judgment
whenever
he
discusses
the
letter
of
scripture
he
uses
his
mind
in
other
things
much
after
the
modern
method
in
the
second
half
of
the
same
century
hottinger
in
his
theological
examination
of
the
history
of
creation
breaks
from
the
belief
in
the
phoenix
but
his
scepticism
is
carefully
kept
within
the
limits
imposed
by
scripture
he
avows
his
doubts
first
because
god
created
the
animals
in
couples
while
the
phoenix
is
represented
as
a
single
unmated
creature
secondly
because
noah
when
he
entered
the
ark
brought
the
animals
in
by
sevens
while
there
were
never
so
many
individuals
of
the
phoenix
species
thirdly
because
no
man
is
known
who
dares
assert
that
he
has
ever
seen
this
bird
fourthly
because
those
who
assert
there
is
a
phoenix
differ
among
themselves
in
view
of
these
attacks
on
the
salamander
and
the
phoenix
we
are
not
surprised
to
find
before
the
end
of
the
century
scepticism
regarding
the
basilisk
the
eminent
kirchmaier
at
the
university
of
wittenberg
treats
phoenix
and
basilisk
alike
as
old
wives
fables
as
to
the
phoenix
he
denies
its
existence
not
only
because
noah
took
no
such
bird
into
the
ark
but
also
because
as
he
pithily
remarks
birds
come
from
eggs
not
from
ashes
but
the
unicorn
he
can
not
resign
nor
will
he
even
concede
that
the
unicorn
is
a
rhinoceros
he
appeals
to
job
and
to
marco
polo
to
prove
that
this
animal
as
usually
conceived
really
exists
and
says
who
would
not
fear
to
deny
the
existence
of
the
unicorn
since
holy
scripture
names
him
with
distinct
praises
as
to
the
other
great
animals
mentioned
in
scripture
he
is
so
rationalistic
as
to
admit
that
behemoth
was
an
elephant
and
leviathan
a
whale
but
these
germs
of
a
fruitful
scepticism
grew
and
we
soon
find
dannhauer
going
a
step
further
and
declaring
his
disbelief
even
in
the
unicorn
insisting
that
it
was
a
rhinoceros
only
that
and
nothing
more

main
current

the
inquiry
into
nature
having
thus
been
pursued
nearly
two
thousand
years
theologically
we
find
by
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
some
promising
beginnings
of
a
different
method
the
method
of
inquiry
into
nature
scientifically
the
method
which
seeks
not
plausibilities
but
facts
at
that
time
edward
wotton
led
the
way
in
england
and
conrad
gesner
on
the
continent
by
observations
widely
extended
carefully
noted
and
thoughtfully
classified
this
better
method
of
interrogating
nature
soon
led
to
the
formation
of
societies
for
the
same
purpose
in
was
founded
an
academy
for
the
study
of
nature
at
naples
but
theologians
becoming
alarmed
suppressed
it
and
for
nearly
one
hundred
years
there
was
no
new
combined
effort
of
that
sort
until
in
began
the
meetings
in
london
of
what
was
afterward
the
royal
society
then
came
the
academy
of
sciences
in
france
and
the
accademia
del
cimento
in
italy
others
followed
in
all
parts
of
the
world
and
a
great
new
movement
was
begun
theologians
soon
saw
a
danger
in
this
movement
in
italy
prince
leopold
de
medici
a
protector
of
the
florentine
academy
was
bribed
with
a
cardinal
hat
to
neglect
it
and
from
the
days
of
urban
viii
to
pius
ix
a
similar
spirit
was
there
shown
in
france
there
were
frequent
ecclesiastical
interferences
of
which
buffon
humiliation
for
stating
a
simple
scientific
truth
was
a
noted
example
in
england
protestantism
was
at
first
hardly
more
favourable
toward
the
royal
society
and
the
great
south
denounced
it
in
his
sermons
as
irreligious
fortunately
one
thing
prevented
an
open
breach
between
theology
and
science
while
new
investigators
had
mainly
given
up
the
medieval
method
so
dear
to
the
church
they
had
very
generally
retained
the
conception
of
direct
creation
and
of
design
throughout
creation
a
design
having
as
its
main
purpose
the
profit
instruction
enjoyment
and
amusement
of
man
on
this
the
naturally
opposing
tendencies
of
theology
and
science
were
compromised
science
while
somewhat
freed
from
its
old
limitations
became
the
handmaid
of
theology
in
illustrating
the
doctrine
of
creative
design
and
always
with
apparent
deference
to
the
chaldean
and
other
ancient
myths
and
legends
embodied
in
the
hebrew
sacred
books
about
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
came
a
great
victory
of
the
scientific
over
the
theologic
method
at
that
time
francesco
redi
published
the
results
of
his
inquiries
into
the
doctrine
of
spontaneous
generation
for
ages
a
widely
accepted
doctrine
had
been
that
water
filth
and
carrion
had
received
power
from
the
creator
to
generate
worms
insects
and
a
multitude
of
the
smaller
animals
and
this
doctrine
had
been
especially
welcomed
by
augustine
and
many
of
the
fathers
since
it
relieved
the
almighty
of
making
adam
of
naming
and
noah
of
living
in
the
ark
with
these
innumerable
despised
species
but
to
this
fallacy
redi
put
an
end
by
researches
which
could
not
be
gainsaid
he
showed
that
every
one
of
these
animals
came
from
an
egg
each
therefore
must
be
the
lineal
descendant
of
an
animal
created
named
and
preserved
from
the
beginning
similar
work
went
on
in
england
but
under
more
distinctly
theological
limitations
in
the
same
seventeenth
century
a
very
famous
and
popular
english
book
was
published
by
the
naturalist
john
ray
a
fellow
of
the
royal
society
who
produced
a
number
of
works
on
plants
fishes
and
birds
but
the
most
widely
read
of
all
was
entitled
the
wisdom
of
god
manifested
in
the
works
of
creation
between
the
years
and
it
passed
through
nearly
twenty
editions
ray
argued
the
goodness
and
wisdom
of
god
from
the
adaptation
of
the
animals
not
only
to
man
uses
but
to
their
own
lives
and
surroundings
in
the
first
years
of
the
eighteenth
century
nehemiah
grew
of
the
royal
society
published
his
cosmologia
sacra
to
refute
opinions
by
producing
evidences
of
creative
design
discussing
the
ends
of
providence
he
says
a
crane
which
is
scurvy
meat
lays
but
two
eggs
in
the
year
but
a
pheasant
and
partridge
both
excellent
meat
lay
and
hatch
fifteen
or
twenty
he
points
to
the
fact
that
those
of
value
which
lay
few
at
a
time
sit
the
oftener
as
the
woodcock
and
the
dove
he
breaks
decidedly
from
the
doctrine
that
noxious
things
in
nature
are
caused
by
sin
and
shows
that
they
too
are
useful
that
if
nettles
sting
it
is
to
secure
an
excellent
medicine
for
children
and
cattle
that
if
the
bramble
hurts
man
it
makes
all
the
better
hedge
and
that
if
it
chances
to
prick
the
owner
it
tears
the
thief
weasels
kites
and
other
hurtful
animals
induce
us
to
watchfulness
thistles
and
moles
to
good
husbandry
lice
oblige
us
to
cleanliness
in
our
bodies
spiders
in
our
houses
and
the
moth
in
our
clothes
this
very
optimistic
view
triumphing
over
the
theological
theory
of
noxious
animals
and
plants
as
effects
of
sin
which
prevailed
with
so
much
force
from
augustine
to
wesley
was
developed
into
nobler
form
during
the
century
by
various
thinkers
and
especially
by
archdeacon
paley
whose
natural
theology
exercised
a
powerful
influence
down
to
recent
times
the
same
tendency
appeared
in
other
countries
though
various
philosophers
showed
weak
points
in
the
argument
and
goethe
made
sport
of
it
in
a
noted
verse
praising
the
forethought
of
the
creator
in
foreordaining
the
cork
tree
to
furnish
stoppers
for
shortly
before
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
main
movement
culminated
in
the
bridgewater
treatises
pursuant
to
the
will
of
the
eighth
earl
of
bridgewater
the
president
of
the
royal
society
selected
eight
persons
each
to
receive
a
thousand
pounds
sterling
for
writing
and
publishing
a
treatise
on
the
power
wisdom
and
goodness
of
god
as
manifested
in
the
creation
of
these
the
leading
essays
in
regard
to
animated
nature
were
those
of
thomas
chalmers
on
the
adaptation
of
external
nature
to
the
moral
and
intellectual
condition
of
man
of
sir
charles
bell
on
the
hand
as
evincing
design
of
roget
on
animal
and
vegetable
physiology
with
reference
to
natural
theology
and
of
kirby
on
the
habits
and
instincts
of
animals
with
reference
to
natural
theology
besides
these
there
were
treatises
by
whewell
buckland
kidd
and
prout
the
work
was
well
done
it
was
a
marked
advance
on
all
that
had
appeared
before
in
matter
method
and
spirit
looking
back
upon
it
now
we
can
see
that
it
was
provisional
but
that
it
was
none
the
less
fruitful
in
truth
and
we
may
well
remember
darwin
remark
on
the
stimulating
effect
of
mistaken
theories
as
compared
with
the
sterilizing
effect
of
mistaken
observations
mistaken
observations
lead
men
astray
mistaken
theories
suggest
true
theories
an
effort
made
in
so
noble
a
spirit
certainly
does
not
deserve
the
ridicule
that
in
our
own
day
has
sometimes
been
lavished
upon
it
curiously
indeed
one
of
the
most
contemptuous
of
these
criticisms
has
been
recently
made
by
one
of
the
most
strenuous
defenders
of
orthodoxy
no
less
eminent
a
of
the
faith
than
the
rev
zoeckler
says
of
this
movement
to
demonstrate
creative
purpose
and
design
and
of
the
men
who
took
part
in
it
the
earth
appeared
in
their
representation
of
it
like
a
great
clothing
shop
and
soup
kitchen
and
god
as
a
glorified
rationalistic
professor
such
a
statement
as
this
is
far
from
just
to
the
conceptions
of
such
men
as
butler
paley
and
chalmers
no
matter
how
fully
the
thinking
world
has
now
outlived
them

but
noble
as
the
work
of
these
men
was
the
foundation
of
fact
on
which
they
reared
it
became
evidently
more
and
more
insecure
for
as
far
back
as
the
seventeenth
century
acute
theologians
had
begun
to
discern
difficulties
more
serious
than
any
that
had
before
confronted
them
more
and
more
it
was
seen
that
the
number
of
different
species
was
far
greater
than
the
world
had
hitherto
imagined
greater
and
greater
had
become
the
old
difficulty
in
conceiving
that
of
these
innumerable
species
each
had
been
specially
created
by
the
almighty
hand
that
each
had
been
brought
before
adam
by
the
almighty
to
be
named
and
that
each
in
couples
or
in
sevens
had
been
gathered
by
noah
into
the
ark
but
the
difficulties
thus
suggested
were
as
nothing
compared
to
those
raised
by
the
distribution
of
animals
even
in
the
first
days
of
the
church
this
had
aroused
serious
thought
and
above
all
in
the
great
mind
of
augustine
in
his
city
of
god
he
had
stated
the
difficulty
as
follows
but
there
is
a
question
about
all
these
kinds
of
beasts
which
are
neither
tamed
by
man
nor
spring
from
the
earth
like
frogs
such
as
wolves
and
others
of
that
sort
as
to
how
they
could
find
their
way
to
the
islands
after
that
flood
which
destroyed
every
living
thing
not
preserved
in
the
ark
some
indeed
might
be
thought
to
reach
islands
by
swimming
in
case
these
were
very
near
but
some
islands
are
so
remote
from
continental
lands
that
it
does
not
seem
possible
that
any
creature
could
reach
them
by
swimming
it
is
not
an
incredible
thing
either
that
some
animals
may
have
been
captured
by
men
and
taken
with
them
to
those
lands
which
they
intended
to
inhabit
in
order
that
they
might
have
the
pleasure
of
hunting
and
it
can
not
be
denied
that
the
transfer
may
have
been
accomplished
through
the
agency
of
angels
commanded
or
allowed
to
perform
this
labour
by
god
but
this
difficulty
had
now
assumed
a
magnitude
of
which
augustine
never
dreamed
most
powerful
of
all
agencies
to
increase
it
were
the
voyages
of
columbus
vasco
da
gama
magellan
amerigo
vespucci
and
other
navigators
of
the
period
of
discovery
still
more
serious
did
it
become
as
the
great
islands
of
the
southern
seas
were
explored
every
navigator
brought
home
tidings
of
new
species
of
animals
and
of
races
of
men
living
in
parts
of
the
world
where
the
theologians
relying
on
the
statement
of
paul
that
the
gospel
had
gone
into
all
lands
had
for
ages
declared
there
could
be
none
until
finally
it
overtaxed
even
the
theological
imagination
to
conceive
of
angels
in
obedience
to
the
divine
command
distributing
the
various
animals
over
the
earth
dropping
the
megatherium
in
south
america
the
archeopteryx
in
europe
the
ornithorhynchus
in
australia
and
the
opossum
in
north
america
the
first
striking
evidence
of
this
new
difficulty
was
shown
by
the
eminent
jesuit
missionary
joseph
acosta
in
his
natural
and
moral
history
of
the
indies
published
in
he
proved
himself
honest
and
lucid
though
entangled
in
most
of
the
older
scriptural
views
he
broke
away
from
many
but
the
distribution
of
animals
gave
him
great
trouble
having
shown
the
futility
of
augustine
other
explanations
he
quaintly
asks
who
can
imagine
that
in
so
long
a
voyage
men
woulde
take
the
paines
to
carrie
foxes
to
peru
especially
that
kinde
they
call
which
is
the
filthiest
i
have
seene
who
woulde
likewise
say
that
they
have
carried
tygers
and
lyons
truly
it
were
a
thing
worthy
the
laughing
at
to
thinke
so
it
was
sufficient
yea
very
much
for
men
driven
against
their
willes
by
tempest
in
so
long
and
unknowne
a
voyage
to
escape
with
their
owne
lives
without
busying
themselves
to
carrie
woolves
and
foxes
and
to
nourish
them
at
sea
it
was
under
the
impression
made
by
this
new
array
of
facts
that
in
abraham
milius
published
at
geneva
his
book
on
the
origin
of
animals
and
the
migration
of
peoples
this
book
shows
like
that
of
acosta
the
shock
and
strain
to
which
the
discovery
of
america
subjected
the
received
theological
scheme
of
things
it
was
issued
with
the
special
approbation
of
the
bishop
of
salzburg
and
it
indicates
the
possibility
that
a
solution
of
the
whole
trouble
may
be
found
in
the
text
let
the
earth
bring
forth
the
living
creature
after
his
kind
milius
goes
on
to
show
that
the
ancient
philosophers
agree
with
moses
and
that
the
earth
and
the
waters
and
especially
the
heat
of
the
sun
and
of
the
genial
sky
together
with
that
slimy
and
putrid
quality
which
seems
to
be
inherent
in
the
soil
may
furnish
the
origin
for
fishes
terrestrial
animals
and
birds
on
the
other
hand
he
is
very
severe
against
those
who
imagine
that
man
can
have
had
the
same
origin
with
animals
but
the
subject
with
which
milius
especially
grapples
is
the
distribution
of
animals
he
is
greatly
exercised
by
the
many
species
found
in
america
and
in
remote
islands
of
the
ocean
species
entirely
unknown
in
the
other
continents
and
of
course
he
is
especially
troubled
by
the
fact
that
these
species
existing
in
those
exceedingly
remote
parts
of
the
earth
do
not
exist
in
the
neighbourhood
of
mount
ararat
he
confesses
that
to
explain
the
distribution
of
animals
is
the
most
difficult
part
of
the
problem
if
it
be
urged
that
birds
could
reach
america
by
flying
and
fishes
by
swimming
he
asks
what
of
the
beasts
which
neither
fly
nor
swim
yet
even
as
to
the
birds
he
asks
is
there
not
an
infinite
variety
of
winged
creatures
who
fly
so
slowly
and
heavily
and
have
such
a
horror
of
the
water
that
they
would
not
even
dare
trust
themselves
to
fly
over
a
wide
river
as
to
fishes
he
says
they
are
very
averse
to
wandering
from
their
native
waters
and
he
shows
that
there
are
now
reported
many
species
of
american
and
east
indian
fishes
entirely
unknown
on
the
other
continents
whose
presence
therefore
can
not
be
explained
by
any
theory
of
natural
dispersion
of
those
who
suggest
that
land
animals
may
have
been
dispersed
over
the
earth
by
the
direct
agency
of
man
for
his
use
or
pleasure
he
asks
who
would
like
to
get
different
sorts
of
lions
bears
tigers
and
other
ferocious
and
noxious
creatures
on
board
ship
who
would
trust
himself
with
them
and
who
would
wish
to
plant
colonies
of
such
creatures
in
new
desirable
lands
his
conclusion
is
that
plants
and
animals
take
their
origin
in
the
lands
wherein
they
are
found
an
opinion
which
he
supports
by
quoting
from
the
two
narrations
in
genesis
passages
which
imply
generative
force
in
earth
and
water
but
in
the
eighteenth
century
matters
had
become
even
worse
for
the
theological
view
to
meet
the
difficulty
the
eminent
benedictine
dom
calmet
in
his
commentary
expressed
the
belief
that
all
the
species
of
a
genus
had
originally
formed
one
species
and
he
dwelt
on
this
view
as
one
which
enabled
him
to
explain
the
possibility
of
gathering
all
animals
into
the
ark
this
idea
dangerous
as
it
was
to
the
fabric
of
orthodoxy
and
involving
a
profound
separation
from
the
general
doctrine
of
the
church
seems
to
have
been
abroad
among
thinking
men
for
we
find
in
the
latter
half
of
the
same
century
even
linnaeus
inclining
to
consider
it
it
was
time
indeed
that
some
new
theological
theory
be
evolved
the
great
linnaeus
himself
in
spite
of
his
famous
declaration
favouring
the
fixity
of
species
had
dealt
a
to
the
old
theory
in
his
systema
naturae
published
in
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
he
had
enumerated
four
thousand
species
of
animals
and
the
difficulties
involved
in
the
naming
of
each
of
them
by
adam
and
in
bringing
them
together
in
the
ark
appeared
to
all
thinking
men
more
and
more
insurmountable
what
was
more
embarrassing
the
number
of
distinct
species
went
on
increasing
rapidly
indeed
enormously
until
as
an
eminent
zoological
authority
of
our
own
time
has
declared
for
every
one
of
the
species
enumerated
by
linnaeus
more
than
fifty
kinds
are
known
to
the
naturalist
of
and
the
number
of
species
still
unknown
doubtless
far
exceeds
the
list
of
those
recorded
already
there
were
premonitions
of
the
strain
made
upon
scripture
by
requiring
a
hundred
and
sixty
distinct
miraculous
interventions
of
the
creator
to
produce
the
hundred
and
sixty
species
of
land
shells
found
in
the
little
island
of
madeira
alone
and
fourteen
hundred
distinct
interventions
to
produce
the
actual
number
of
distinct
species
of
a
single
shell
ever
more
and
more
difficult
too
became
the
question
of
the
geographical
distribution
of
animals
as
new
explorations
were
made
in
various
parts
of
the
world
this
danger
to
the
theological
view
went
on
increasing
the
sloths
in
south
america
suggested
painful
questions
how
could
animals
so
sluggish
have
got
away
from
the
neighbourhood
of
mount
ararat
so
completely
and
have
travelled
so
far
the
explorations
in
australia
and
neighbouring
islands
made
matters
still
worse
for
there
was
found
in
those
regions
a
whole
realm
of
animals
differing
widely
from
those
of
other
parts
of
the
earth
the
problem
before
the
strict
theologians
became
for
example
how
to
explain
the
fact
that
the
kangaroo
can
have
been
in
the
ark
and
be
now
only
found
in
australia
his
saltatory
powers
are
indeed
great
but
how
could
he
by
any
series
of
leaps
have
sprung
across
the
intervening
mountains
plains
and
oceans
to
that
remote
continent
and
if
the
theory
were
adopted
that
at
some
period
a
causeway
extended
across
the
vast
chasm
separating
australia
from
the
nearest
mainland
why
did
not
lions
tigers
camels
and
camelopards
force
or
find
their
way
across
it
the
theological
theory
therefore
had
by
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
gone
to
pieces
the
wiser
theologians
waited
the
unwise
indulged
in
exhortations
to
root
out
the
wicked
heart
of
unbelief
in
denunciation
of
science
falsely
so
called
and
in
frantic
declarations
that
the
bible
is
true
by
which
they
meant
that
the
limited
understanding
of
it
which
they
had
happened
to
inherit
is
true
by
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
whole
theological
theory
of
creation
though
still
preached
everywhere
as
a
matter
of
form
was
clearly
seen
by
all
thinking
men
to
be
hopelessly
lost
such
strong
men
as
cardinal
wiseman
in
the
roman
church
dean
buckland
in
the
anglican
and
hugh
miller
in
the
scottish
church
made
heroic
efforts
to
save
something
from
it
but
all
to
no
purpose
that
sturdy
teutonic
and
honesty
which
is
the
best
legacy
of
the
middle
ages
to
christendom
asserted
itself
in
the
old
strongholds
of
theological
thought
the
universities
neither
the
powerful
logic
of
bishop
butler
nor
the
nimble
reasoning
of
archdeacon
paley
availed
just
as
the
line
of
astronomical
thinkers
from
copernicus
to
newton
had
destroyed
the
old
astronomy
in
which
the
earth
was
the
centre
and
the
almighty
sitting
above
the
firmament
the
agent
in
moving
the
heavenly
bodies
about
it
with
his
own
hands
so
now
a
race
of
biological
thinkers
had
destroyed
the
old
idea
of
a
creator
minutely
contriving
and
fashioning
all
animals
to
suit
the
needs
and
purposes
of
man
they
had
developed
a
system
of
a
very
different
sort

theological
and
scientific
theories
of
an
evolution
in
animated
nature
we
have
seen
thus
far
how
there
came
into
the
thinking
of
mankind
upon
the
visible
universe
and
its
inhabitants
the
idea
of
a
creation
virtually
instantaneous
and
complete
and
of
a
creator
in
human
form
with
human
attributes
who
spoke
matter
into
existence
literally
by
the
exercise
of
his
throat
and
lips
or
shaped
and
placed
it
with
his
hands
and
fingers
we
have
seen
that
this
view
came
from
far
that
it
existed
in
the
and
egyptian
civilizations
and
probably
in
others
of
the
earliest
date
known
to
us
that
its
main
features
passed
thence
into
the
sacred
books
of
the
hebrews
and
then
into
the
early
christian
church
by
whose
theologians
it
was
developed
through
the
middle
ages
and
maintained
during
the
modern
period
but
while
this
idea
was
thus
developed
by
a
succession
of
noble
and
thoughtful
men
through
thousands
of
years
another
conception
to
all
appearance
equally
ancient
was
developed
sometimes
in
antagonism
to
it
sometimes
mingled
with
it
the
conception
of
all
living
beings
as
wholly
or
in
part
the
result
of
a
growth
process
of
an
evolution
this
idea
in
various
forms
became
a
powerful
factor
in
nearly
all
the
greater
ancient
theologies
and
philosophies
for
very
widespread
among
the
early
peoples
who
attained
to
much
thinking
power
was
a
conception
that
in
obedience
to
the
divine
fiat
a
watery
chaos
produced
the
earth
and
that
the
sea
and
land
gave
birth
to
their
inhabitants
this
is
clearly
seen
in
those
records
of
thought
deciphered
in
these
latter
years
to
which
reference
has
already
been
made
in
these
we
have
a
watery
chaos
which
under
divine
action
brings
forth
the
earth
and
its
inhabitants
first
the
sea
animals
and
then
the
land
animals
the
latter
being
separated
into
three
kinds
substantially
as
recorded
afterward
in
the
hebrew
accounts
at
the
various
stages
in
the
work
the
chaldean
creator
pronounces
it
beautiful
just
as
the
hebrew
creator
in
our
own
later
account
pronounces
it
good
in
both
accounts
there
is
placed
over
the
whole
creation
a
solid
concave
firmament
in
both
light
is
created
first
and
the
heavenly
bodies
are
afterward
placed
for
signs
and
for
seasons
in
both
the
number
seven
is
especially
sacred
giving
rise
to
a
sacred
division
of
time
and
to
much
else
it
may
be
added
that
with
many
other
features
in
the
hebrew
legends
evidently
drawn
from
the
chaldean
the
account
of
the
creation
in
each
is
followed
by
a
legend
regarding
the
fall
of
man
and
a
deluge
many
details
of
which
clearly
passed
in
slightly
modified
form
from
the
chaldean
into
the
hebrew
accounts
it
would
have
been
a
miracle
indeed
if
these
primitive
conceptions
wrought
out
with
so
much
poetic
vigour
in
that
earlier
civilization
on
the
tigris
and
euphrates
had
failed
to
influence
the
hebrews
who
during
the
most
plastic
periods
of
their
development
were
under
the
tutelage
of
their
chaldean
neighbours
since
the
researches
of
layard
george
smith
oppert
schrader
jensen
sayce
and
their
compeers
there
is
no
longer
a
reasonable
doubt
that
this
ancient
view
of
the
world
elaborated
if
not
originated
in
that
earlier
civilization
came
thence
as
a
legacy
to
the
hebrews
who
wrought
it
in
a
somewhat
disjointed
but
mainly
monotheistic
form
into
the
poetic
whole
which
forms
one
of
the
most
precious
treasures
of
ancient
thought
preserved
in
the
book
of
genesis
thus
it
was
that
while
the
idea
of
a
simple
material
creation
literally
by
the
hands
and
fingers
or
voice
of
the
creator
became
as
we
have
seen
the
of
a
powerful
stream
of
theological
thought
and
while
this
stream
was
swollen
from
age
to
age
by
contributions
from
the
fathers
doctors
and
learned
divines
of
the
church
catholic
and
protestant
there
was
poured
into
it
this
lesser
current
always
discernible
and
at
times
clearly
separated
from
it
a
current
of
belief
in
a
process
of
evolution
the
rev
sayce
of
oxford
than
whom
no
scholar
carries
more
weight
in
a
matter
of
this
kind
has
recently
declared
his
belief
that
the
theory
was
the
undoubted
source
of
the
similar
theory
propounded
by
the
ionic
philosopher
anaximander
the
greek
thinkers
deriving
this
view
from
the
babylonians
through
the
phoenicians
he
also
allows
that
from
the
same
source
its
main
features
were
adopted
into
both
the
accounts
given
in
the
first
of
our
sacred
books
and
in
this
general
view
the
most
eminent
christian
assyriologists
concur
it
is
true
that
these
sacred
accounts
of
ours
contradict
each
other
in
that
part
of
the
first
or
elohistic
account
given
in
the
first
chapter
of
genesis
the
waters
bring
forth
fishes
marine
animals
and
birds
genesis
i
but
in
that
part
of
the
second
or
jehovistic
account
given
in
the
second
chapter
of
genesis
both
the
land
animals
and
birds
are
declared
to
have
been
created
not
out
of
the
water
but
out
of
the
ground
genesis
ii
the
dialectic
skill
of
the
fathers
was
easily
equal
to
explaining
away
this
contradiction
but
the
old
current
of
thought
strengthened
by
both
these
legends
arrested
their
attention
and
passing
through
the
minds
of
a
succession
of
the
greatest
men
of
the
church
influenced
theological
opinion
deeply
if
not
widely
for
ages
in
favour
of
an
evolution
theory
but
there
was
still
another
ancient
source
of
evolution
ideas
thoughtful
men
of
the
early
civilizations
which
were
developed
along
the
great
rivers
in
the
warmer
regions
of
the
earth
noted
how
the
as
he
rose
in
his
fullest
might
caused
the
water
and
the
rich
soil
to
teem
with
the
lesser
forms
of
life
in
egypt
especially
men
saw
how
under
this
divine
power
the
nile
slime
brought
forth
creeping
things
innumerable
hence
mainly
this
ancient
belief
that
the
animals
and
man
were
produced
by
lifeless
matter
at
the
divine
command
in
the
beginning
was
supplemented
by
the
idea
that
some
of
the
lesser
animals
especially
the
insects
were
produced
by
a
later
evolution
being
evoked
after
the
original
creation
from
various
sources
but
chiefly
from
matter
in
a
state
of
decay
this
crude
early
view
aided
doubtless
in
giving
germs
of
a
better
evolution
theory
to
the
early
greeks
anaximander
empedocles
anaxagoras
and
greatest
of
all
aristotle
as
we
have
seen
developed
them
making
their
way
at
times
by
guesses
toward
truths
since
established
by
observation
aristotle
especially
both
by
speculation
and
observation
arrived
at
some
results
which
had
greek
freedom
of
thought
continued
might
have
brought
the
world
long
since
to
its
present
plane
of
biological
knowledge
for
he
reached
something
like
the
modern
idea
of
a
succession
of
higher
organizations
from
lower
and
made
the
fruitful
suggestion
of
a
perfecting
principle
in
nature
with
the
coming
in
of
christian
theology
this
tendency
toward
a
yet
truer
theory
of
evolution
was
mainly
stopped
but
the
old
crude
view
remained
and
as
a
typical
example
of
it
we
may
note
the
opinion
of
st
basil
the
great
in
the
fourth
century
discussing
the
work
of
creation
he
declares
that
at
the
command
of
god
the
waters
were
gifted
with
productive
power
from
slime
and
muddy
places
frogs
flies
and
gnats
came
into
being
and
he
finally
declares
that
the
same
voice
which
gave
this
energy
and
quality
of
productiveness
to
earth
and
water
shall
be
similarly
efficacious
until
the
end
of
the
world
gregory
of
nyssa
held
a
similar
view
this
idea
of
these
great
fathers
of
the
eastern
church
took
even
stronger
hold
on
the
great
father
of
the
western
church
for
augustine
so
fettered
usually
by
the
letter
of
the
sacred
text
broke
from
his
own
famous
doctrine
as
to
the
acceptance
of
scripture
and
spurned
the
generally
received
belief
of
a
creative
process
like
that
by
which
a
toymaker
brings
into
existence
a
box
of
playthings
in
his
great
treatise
on
genesis
he
says
to
suppose
that
god
formed
man
from
the
dust
with
bodily
hands
is
very
childish
god
neither
formed
man
with
bodily
hands
nor
did
he
breathe
upon
him
with
throat
and
lips
augustine
then
suggests
the
adoption
of
the
old
emanation
or
evolution
theory
shows
that
certain
very
small
animals
may
not
have
been
created
on
the
fifth
and
sixth
days
but
may
have
originated
later
from
putrefying
matter
argues
that
even
if
this
be
so
god
is
still
their
creator
dwells
upon
such
a
potential
creation
as
involved
in
the
actual
creation
and
speaks
of
animals
whose
numbers
the
unfolded
in
his
great
treatise
on
the
trinity
the
work
to
which
he
devoted
the
best
thirty
years
of
his
life
we
find
the
full
growth
of
this
opinion
he
develops
at
length
the
view
that
in
the
creation
of
living
beings
there
was
something
like
a
growth
that
god
is
the
ultimate
author
but
works
through
secondary
causes
and
finally
argues
that
certain
substances
are
endowed
by
god
with
the
power
of
producing
certain
classes

this
idea
of
a
development
by
secondary
causes
apart
from
the
original
creation
was
helped
in
its
growth
by
a
theological
exigency
more
and
more
as
the
organic
world
was
observed
the
vast
multitude
of
petty
animals
winged
creatures
and
creeping
things
was
felt
to
be
a
strain
upon
the
sacred
narrative
more
and
more
it
became
difficult
to
reconcile
the
dignity
of
the
almighty
with
his
work
in
bringing
each
of
these
creatures
before
adam
to
be
named
or
to
reconcile
the
human
limitations
of
adam
with
his
work
in
naming
every
living
creature
or
to
reconcile
the
dimensions
of
noah
ark
with
the
space
required
for
preserving
all
of
them
and
the
food
of
all
sorts
necessary
for
their
sustenance
whether
they
were
admitted
by
twos
as
stated
in
one
scriptural
account
or
by
sevens
as
stated
in
the
other
the
inadequate
size
of
the
ark
gave
especial
trouble
origen
had
dealt
with
it
by
suggesting
that
the
cubit
was
six
times
greater
than
had
been
supposed
bede
explained
noah
ability
to
complete
so
large
a
vessel
by
supposing
that
he
worked
upon
it
during
a
hundred
years
and
as
to
the
provision
of
food
taken
into
it
he
declared
that
there
was
no
need
of
a
supply
for
more
than
one
day
since
god
could
throw
the
animals
into
a
deep
sleep
or
otherwise
miraculously
make
one
day
supply
sufficient
he
also
lessened
the
strain
on
faith
still
more
by
diminishing
the
number
of
animals
taken
into
the
ark
supporting
his
view
upon
augustine
theory
of
the
later
development
of
insects
out
of
carrion
doubtless
this
theological
necessity
was
among
the
main
reasons
which
led
isidore
of
seville
in
the
seventh
century
to
incorporate
this
theory
supported
by
st
basil
and
augustine
into
his
great
encyclopedic
work
which
gave
materials
for
thought
on
god
and
nature
to
so
many
generations
he
familiarized
the
theological
world
still
further
with
the
doctrine
of
secondary
creation
giving
such
examples
of
it
as
that
bees
are
generated
from
decomposed
veal
beetles
from
horseflesh
grasshoppers
from
mules
scorpions
from
crabs
and
in
order
to
give
still
stronger
force
to
the
idea
of
such
transformations
he
dwells
on
the
biblical
account
of
nebuchadnezzar
which
appears
to
have
taken
strong
hold
upon
medieval
thought
in
science
and
he
declares
that
other
human
beings
had
been
changed
into
animals
especially
into
swine
wolves
and
owls
this
doctrine
of
went
on
gathering
strength
until
in
the
twelfth
century
peter
lombard
in
his
theological
summary
the
sentences
so
powerful
in
moulding
the
thought
of
the
church
emphasized
the
distinction
between
animals
which
spring
from
carrion
and
those
which
are
created
from
earth
and
water
the
former
he
holds
to
have
been
created
potentially
the
latter
actually
in
the
century
following
this
idea
was
taken
up
by
thomas
aquinas
and
virtually
received
from
him
its
final
form
in
the
summa
which
remains
the
greatest
work
of
medieval
thought
he
accepts
the
idea
that
certain
animals
spring
from
the
decaying
bodies
of
plants
and
animals
and
declares
that
they
are
produced
by
the
creative
word
of
god
either
actually
or
virtually
he
develops
this
view
by
saying
nothing
was
made
by
god
after
the
six
days
of
creation
absolutely
new
but
it
was
in
some
sense
included
in
the
work
of
the
six
days
and
that
even
new
species
if
any
appear
have
existed
before
in
certain
native
properties
just
as
animals
are
produced
from
putrefaction
the
distinction
thus
developed
between
creation
causally
or
potentially
and
materially
or
formally
was
made
much
of
by
commentators
afterward
cornelius
a
lapide
spread
it
by
saying
that
certain
animals
were
created
not
absolutely
but
only
derivatively
and
this
thought
was
still
further
developed
three
centuries
later
by
augustinus
eugubinus
who
tells
us
that
after
the
first
creative
energy
had
called
forth
land
and
water
light
was
made
by
the
almighty
the
instrument
of
all
future
creation
and
that
the
light
called
everything
into
existence
all
this
science
falsely
so
called
so
sedulously
developed
by
the
master
minds
of
the
church
and
yet
so
futile
that
we
might
almost
suppose
that
the
great
apostle
in
a
glow
of
prophetic
vision
had
foreseen
it
in
his
famous
condemnation
seems
at
this
distance
very
harmless
indeed
yet
to
many
guardians
of
the
sacred
deposit
of
doctrine
in
the
church
even
so
slight
a
departure
from
the
main
current
of
thought
seemed
dangerous
it
appeared
to
them
like
pressing
the
doctrine
of
secondary
causes
to
a
perilous
extent
and
about
the
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
century
we
have
the
eminent
spanish
jesuit
and
theologian
suarez
denouncing
it
and
declaring
augustine
a
heretic
for
his
share
in
it
but
there
was
little
danger
to
the
older
idea
just
then
the
main
theological
tendency
was
so
strong
that
the
world
kept
on
as
of
old
biblical
theology
continued
to
spin
its
own
webs
out
of
its
own
bowels
and
all
the
lesser
theological
flies
continued
to
be
entangled
in
them
yet
here
and
there
stronger
thinkers
broke
loose
from
this
entanglement
and
helped
somewhat
to
disentangle
others

thinking
on

problems
of

began
to
gain

on

sides

were

caused

general
theological
view
to
appear
more
and
more
inadequate

of
those
who
should
be
mentioned
with
reverence
as
beginning
to
develop
again
that
current
of
greek
thought
which
the
system
drawn
from
our
sacred
books
by
the
fathers
and
doctors
of
the
church
had
interrupted
for
more
than
a
thousand
years
was
giordano
bruno
his
utterances
were
indeed
vague
and
enigmatical
but
this
fault
may
well
be
forgiven
him
for
he
saw
but
too
clearly
what
must
be
his
reward
for
any
more
open
statements
his
reward
indeed
came
even
for
his
faulty
utterances
when
toward
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
thoughtful
men
from
all
parts
of
the
world
united
in
erecting
his
statue
on
the
spot
where
he
had
been
burned
by
the
roman
inquisition
nearly
three
hundred
years
before
after
bruno
death
during
the
first
half
of
the
seventeenth
century
descartes
seemed
about
to
take
the
leadership
of
human
thought
his
theories
however
superseded
now
gave
a
great
impulse
to
investigation
then
his
genius
in
promoting
an
evolution
doctrine
as
regards
the
mechanical
formation
of
the
solar
system
was
great
and
his
mode
of
thought
strengthened
the
current
of
evolutionary
doctrine
generally
but
his
constant
dread
of
persecution
both
from
catholics
and
protestants
led
him
steadily
to
veil
his
thoughts
and
even
to
suppress
them
the
execution
of
bruno
had
occurred
in
his
childhood
and
in
the
midst
of
his
career
he
had
watched
the
galileo
struggle
in
all
its
stages
he
had
seen
his
own
works
condemned
by
university
after
university
under
the
direction
of
theologians
and
placed
upon
the
roman
index
although
he
gave
new
and
striking
arguments
to
prove
the
existence
of
god
and
humbled
himself
before
the
jesuits
he
was
condemned
by
catholics
and
protestants
alike
since
roger
bacon
perhaps
no
great
thinker
had
been
so
completely
abased
and
thwarted
by
theological
oppression
near
the
close
of
the
same
century
another
great
thinker
leibnitz
though
not
propounding
any
full
doctrine
on
evolution
gave
it
an
impulse
by
suggesting
a
view
contrary
to
the
sacrosanct
belief
in
the
immutability
of
species
that
is
to
the
pious
doctrine
that
every
species
in
the
animal
kingdom
now
exists
as
it
left
the
hands
of
the
creator
the
naming
process
by
adam
and
the
door
of
noah
ark
his
punishment
at
the
hands
of
the
church
came
a
few
years
later
when
in
the
jesuits
defeated
his
attempt
to
found
an
academy
of
science
at
vienna
the
imperial
authorities
covered
him
with
honours
but
the
priests
ruling
in
the
confessionals
and
pulpits
would
not
allow
him
the
privilege
of
aiding
his
to
ascertain
god
truths
revealed
in
nature
spinoza
hume
and
kant
may
also
be
mentioned
as
among
those
whose
thinking
even
when
mistaken
might
have
done
much
to
aid
in
the
development
of
a
truer
theory
had
not
the
theologic
atmosphere
of
their
times
been
so
unpropitious
but
a
few
years
after
leibnitz
death
came
in
france
a
thinker
in
natural
science
of
much
less
influence
than
any
of
these
who
made
a
decided
step
forward
early
in
the
eighteenth
century
benoist
de
maillet
a
man
of
the
world
but
a
wide
observer
and
close
thinker
upon
nature
began
meditating
especially
upon
the
origin
of
animal
forms
and
was
led
into
the
idea
of
the
transformation
of
species
and
so
into
a
theory
of
evolution
which
in
some
important
respects
anticipated
modern
ideas
he
definitely
though
at
times
absurdly
conceived
the
production
of
existing
species
by
the
modification
of
their
predecessors
and
he
plainly
accepted
one
of
the
fundamental
maxims
of
modern
geology
that
the
structure
of
the
globe
must
be
studied
in
the
light
of
the
present
course
of
nature
but
he
fell
between
two
ranks
of
adversaries
on
one
side
the
church
authorities
denounced
him
as
a
freethinker
on
the
other
voltaire
ridiculed
him
as
a
devotee
feeling
that
his
greatest
danger
was
from
the
orthodox
theologians
de
maillet
endeavoured
to
protect
himself
by
disguising
his
name
in
the
title
of
his
book
and
by
so
wording
its
preface
and
dedication
that
if
persecuted
he
could
declare
it
a
mere
sport
of
fancy
he
therefore
announced
it
as
the
reverie
of
a
hindu
sage
imparted
to
a
christian
missionary
but
this
strategy
availed
nothing
he
had
allowed
his
hindu
sage
to
suggest
that
the
days
of
creation
named
in
genesis
might
be
long
periods
of
time
and
this
with
other
ideas
of
equally
fearful
import
was
fatal
though
the
book
was
in
type
in
it
was
not
published
till
three
years
after
his
death
on
the
other
hand
the
heterodox
theology
of
voltaire
was
also
aroused
and
as
de
maillet
had
seen
in
the
presence
of
fossils
on
high
mountains
a
proof
that
these
mountains
were
once
below
the
sea
voltaire
recognising
in
this
an
argument
for
the
deluge
of
noah
ridiculed
the
new
thinker
without
mercy
unfortunately
some
of
de
maillet
vagaries
lent
themselves
admirably
to
voltaire
sarcasm
better
material
for
it
could
hardly
be
conceived
than
the
theory
seriously
proposed
that
the
first
human
being
was
born
of
a
mermaid
hence
it
was
that
between
these
two
extremes
of
theology
de
maillet
received
no
recognition
until
very
recently
the
greatest
men
of
science
in
england
and
france
have
united
in
giving
him
his
due
but
his
work
was
not
lost
even
in
his
own
day
robinet
and
bonnet
pushed
forward
victoriously
on
helpful
lines
in
the
second
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
a
great
barrier
was
thrown
across
this
current
the
authority
of
linnaeus
he
was
the
most
eminent
naturalist
of
his
time
a
wide
observer
a
close
thinker
but
the
atmosphere
in
which
he
lived
and
moved
and
had
his
being
was
saturated
with
biblical
theology
and
this
permeated
all
his
thinking
he
who
visits
the
tomb
of
linnaeus
entering
the
beautiful
cathedral
of
upsala
by
its
southern
porch
sees
above
it
wrought
in
stone
the
hebrew
legend
of
creation
in
a
series
of
medallions
the
almighty
in
human
form
accomplishes
the
work
of
each
creative
day
in
due
order
he
puts
in
place
the
solid
firmament
with
the
waters
above
it
the
sun
moon
and
stars
within
it
the
beasts
birds
and
plants
below
it
and
finishes
his
task
by
taking
man
out
of
a
little
hillock
of
the
earth
beneath
and
woman
out
of
man
side
doubtless
linnaeus
as
he
went
to
his
devotions
often
smiled
at
this
childlike
portrayal
yet
he
was
never
able
to
break
away
from
the
idea
it
embodied
at
times
in
face
of
the
difficulties
which
beset
the
orthodox
theory
he
ventured
to
favour
some
slight
concessions
toward
the
end
of
his
life
he
timidly
advanced
the
hypothesis
that
all
the
species
of
one
genus
constituted
at
the
creation
one
species
and
from
the
last
edition
of
his
systema
naturae
he
quietly
left
out
the
strongly
orthodox
statement
of
the
fixity
of
each
species
which
he
had
insisted
upon
in
his
earlier
works
but
he
made
no
adequate
declaration
what
he
might
expect
if
he
openly
and
decidedly
sanctioned
a
newer
view
he
learned
to
his
cost
warnings
came
speedily
both
from
the
catholic
and
protestant
sides
at
a
time
when
eminent
prelates
of
the
older
church
were
eulogizing
debauched
princes
like
louis
xv
and
using
the
unspeakably
obscene
casuistry
of
the
jesuit
sanchez
in
the
education
of
the
priesthood
as
to
the
relations
of
men
to
women
the
modesty
of
the
church
authorities
was
so
shocked
by
linnaeus
proofs
of
a
sexual
system
in
plants
that
for
many
years
his
writings
were
prohibited
in
the
papal
states
and
in
various
other
parts
of
europe
where
clerical
authority
was
strong
enough
to
resist
the
new
scientific
current
not
until
did
one
of
the
more
cardinals
zelanda
succeed
in
gaining
permission
that
minasi
should
discuss
the
linnaean
system
at
rome
and
protestantism
was
quite
as
oppressive
in
a
letter
to
eloius
linnaeus
tells
of
the
rebuke
given
to
science
by
one
of
the
great
lutheran
prelates
of
sweden
bishop
svedberg
from
various
parts
of
europe
detailed
statements
had
been
sent
to
the
royal
academy
of
science
that
water
had
been
turned
into
blood
and
ecclesiastics
had
seen
in
this
an
indication
of
the
wrath
of
god
certainly
against
the
regions
in
which
these
miracles
had
occurred
and
possibly
against
the
whole
world
a
miracle
of
this
sort
appearing
in
sweden
linnaeus
looked
into
it
carefully
and
found
that
the
reddening
of
the
water
was
caused
by
dense
masses
of
minute
insects
news
of
this
explanation
having
reached
the
bishop
he
took
the
field
against
it
he
denounced
this
scientific
discovery
as
a
satanic
abyss
abyssum
satanae
and
declared
the
reddening
of
the
water
is
not
natural
and
when
god
allows
such
a
miracle
to
take
place
satan
endeavours
and
so
do
his
ungodly
and
worldly
tools
to
make
it
signify
nothing
in
face
of
this
onslaught
linnaeus
retreated
he
tells
his
correspondent
that
it
is
difficult
to
say
anything
in
this
matter
and
shields
himself
under
the
statement
it
is
certainly
a
miracle
that
so
many
millions
of
creatures
can
be
so
suddenly
propagated
and
it
shows
undoubtedly
the
power
of
the
infinite
the
great
naturalist
grown
old
and
worn
with
labours
for
science
could
no
longer
resist
the
contemporary
theology
he
settled
into
obedience
to
it
and
while
the
modification
of
his
early
orthodox
view
was
as
we
have
seen
quietly
imbedded
in
the
final
edition
of
his
great
work
he
made
no
special
effort
to
impress
it
upon
the
world
to
all
appearance
he
continued
to
adhere
to
the
doctrine
that
all
existing
species
had
been
created
by
the
almighty
in
the
beginning
and
that
since
the
beginning
no
new
species
had
appeared
yet
even
his
great
authority
could
not
arrest
the
swelling
tide
more
and
more
vast
became
the
number
of
species
more
and
more
incomprehensible
under
the
old
theory
became
the
newly
ascertained
facts
in
geographical
distribution
more
and
more
it
was
felt
that
the
universe
and
animated
beings
had
come
into
existence
by
some
process
other
than
a
special
creation
in
the
beginning
and
the
question
was
constantly
pressing
by
what
process
throughout
the
whole
of
the
eighteenth
century
one
man
was
at
work
on
natural
history
who
might
have
contributed
much
toward
an
answer
to
this
question
this
man
was
buffon
his
powers
of
research
and
thought
were
remarkable
and
his
gift
in
presenting
results
of
research
and
thought
showed
genius
he
had
caught
the
idea
of
an
evolution
in
nature
by
the
variation
of
species
and
was
likely
to
make
a
great
advance
with
it
but
he
too
was
made
to
feel
the
power
of
theology
as
long
as
he
gave
pleasing
descriptions
of
animals
the
church
petted
him
but
when
he
began
to
deduce
truths
of
philosophical
import
the
batteries
of
the
sorbonne
were
opened
upon
him
he
was
made
to
know
that
the
sacred
deposit
of
truth
committed
to
the
church
was
that
in
the
beginning
god
made
the
heavens
and
the
earth
and
that
all
things
were
made
at
the
beginning
of
the
world
for
his

triumph
of

legends
which

had

availed
but
little
for
about
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
fruitful
suggestions
and
even
clear
presentations
of
this
or
that
part
of
a
large
evolutionary
doctrine
came
thick
and
fast
and
from
the
most
divergent
quarters
especially
remarkable
were
those
which
came
from
erasmus
darwin
in
england
from
maupertuis
in
france
from
oken
in
switzerland
and
from
herder
and
most
brilliantly
of
all
from
goethe
in
germany
two
men
among
these
thinkers
must
be
especially
mentioned
treviranus
in
germany
and
lamarck
in
france
each
independently
of
the
other
drew
the
world
more
completely
than
ever
before
in
this
direction
from
treviranus
came
in
his
work
on
biology
and
in
this
he
gave
forth
the
idea
that
from
forms
of
life
originally
simple
had
arisen
all
higher
organizations
by
gradual
development
that
every
living
feature
has
a
capacity
for
receiving
modifications
of
its
structure
from
external
influences
and
that
no
species
had
become
really
extinct
but
that
each
had
passed
into
some
other
species
from
lamarck
came
about
the
same
time
his
researches
and
a
little
later
his
zoological
philosophy
which
introduced
a
new
factor
into
the
process
of
evolution
the
action
of
the
animal
itself
in
its
efforts
toward
a
development
to
suit
new
needs
and
he
gave
as
his
principal
conclusions
the
following
life
tends
to
increase
the
volume
of
each
living
body
and
of
all
its
parts
up
to
a
limit
determined
by
its
own
necessities
new
wants
in
animals
give
rise
to
new
organs
the
development
of
these
organs
is
in
proportion
to
their
employment
new
developments
may
be
transmitted
to
offspring
his
examples
to
illustrate
these
views
such
as
that
of
successive
generations
of
giraffes
lengthening
their
necks
by
stretching
them
to
gather
foliage
and
of
successive
generations
of
kangaroos
lengthening
and
strengthening
their
hind
legs
by
the
necessity
of
keeping
themselves
erect
while
jumping
provoked
laughter
but
the
very
comicality
of
these
illustrations
aided
to
fasten
his
main
conclusion
in
men
memories
in
both
these
statements
imperfect
as
they
were
great
truths
were
embodied
truths
which
were
sure
to
grow
lamarck
declaration
especially
that
the
development
of
organs
is
in
ratio
to
their
employment
and
his
indications
of
the
reproduction
in
progeny
of
what
is
gained
or
lost
in
parents
by
the
influence
of
circumstances
entered
as
a
most
effective
force
into
the
development
of
the
evolution
theory
the
next
great
successor
in
the
apostolate
of
this
idea
of
the
universe
was
geoffroy
as
early
as
he
had
begun
to
form
a
theory
that
species
are
various
modifications
of
the
same
type
and
this
theory
he
developed
testing
it
at
various
stages
as
nature
was
more
and
more
displayed
to
him
it
fell
to
his
lot
to
bear
the
brunt
in
a
struggle
against
heavy
odds
which
lasted
many
years
for
the
man
who
now
took
up
the
warfare
avowedly
for
science
but
unconsciously
for
theology
was
the
foremost
naturalist
then
living
cuvier
his
scientific
eminence
was
deserved
the
highest
honours
of
his
own
and
other
countries
were
given
him
and
he
bore
them
worthily
an
imperial
councillor
under
napoleon
president
of
the
council
of
public
instruction
and
chancellor
of
the
university
under
the
restored
bourbons
grand
officer
of
the
legion
of
honour
a
peer
of
france
minister
of
the
interior
and
president
of
the
council
of
state
under
louis
philippe
he
was
eminent
in
all
these
capacities
and
yet
the
dignity
given
by
such
high
administrative
positions
was
as
nothing
compared
to
his
leadership
in
natural
science
science
throughout
the
world
acknowledged
in
him
its
chief
contemporary
ornament
and
to
this
hour
his
fame
rightly
continues
but
there
was
in
him
as
in
linnaeus
a
survival
of
certain
theological
ways
of
looking
at
the
universe
and
certain
theological
conceptions
of
a
plan
of
creation
it
must
be
said
too
that
while
his
temperament
made
him
distrust
new
hypotheses
of
which
he
had
seen
so
many
born
and
die
his
environment
as
a
great
functionary
of
state
honoured
admired
almost
adored
by
the
greatest
not
only
in
the
state
but
in
the
church
his
solicitude
lest
science
should
receive
some
detriment
by
openly
resisting
the
church
which
had
recaptured
europe
after
the
french
revolution
and
had
made
of
its
enemies
its
footstool
all
these
considerations
led
him
to
oppose
the
new
theory
amid
the
plaudits
then
of
the
foremost
he
threw
across
the
path
of
the
evolution
doctrines
the
whole
mass
of
his
authority
in
favour
of
the
old
theory
of
catastrophic
changes
and
special
creations
geoffroy
stoutly
withstood
him
braving
and
ridicule
treviranus
afar
off
in
his
mathematical
at
bremen
seemed
simply
forgotten
but
the
current
of
evolutionary
thought
could
not
thus
be
checked
dammed
up
for
a
time
it
broke
out
in
new
channels
and
in
ways
and
places
least
expected
turned
away
from
france
it
appeared
especially
in
england
where
great
paleontologists
and
geologists
arose
whose
work
culminated
in
that
of
lyell
specialists
throughout
all
the
world
now
became
more
vigorous
than
ever
gathering
facts
and
thinking
upon
them
in
a
way
which
caused
the
special
creation
theory
to
shrink
more
and
more
broader
and
more
full
became
these
various
rivulets
soon
to
unite
in
one
great
stream
of
thought
in
wells

a
theory
of
evolution
by
natural
selection

varieties

and

the
main
doctrine
of
natural

in

and
others
here
and
there
in
europe
and
america
caught
an
inkling
of
it
but
no
one
outside
of
a
circle
apparently
uninfluential
cared
for
these
things
the
church
was
serene
on
the
continent
it
had
obtained
reactionary
control
of
courts
cabinets
and
universities
in

dean

denouncing

delight
of

and
the
rev

was
doing
the
same
thing
for
the
edification
of
dissenters
in
america
the
mild
suggestions
of
silliman
and
his
compeers
were
met
by
the
protestations
of
the
andover
theologians
headed
by
moses
stuart
neither
of
the
great
english
universities
as
a
rule
took
any
notice
of
the
innovators
save
by
sneers
to
this
current
of
thought
there
was
joined
a
new
element
when
in
robert
chambers
published
his
vestiges
of
creation
the
book
was
attractive
and
was
widely
read
in
chambers
view
the
several
series
of
animated
beings
from
the
simplest
and
oldest
up
to
the
highest
and
most
recent
were
the
result
of
two
distinct
impulses
each
given
once
and
for
all
time
by
the
creator
the
first
of
these
was
an
impulse
imparted
to
forms
of
life
lifting
them
gradually
through
higher
grades
the
second
was
an
impulse
tending
to
modify
organic
substances
in
accordance
with
external
circumstances
in
fact
the
doctrine
of
the
book
was
evolution
tempered
by
miracle
a
stretching
out
of
the
creative
act
through
all
time
a
pious
version
of
lamarck
two
results
followed
one
the
other
leading
to
serious
thought
the
amusing
result
was
that
the
theologians
were
greatly
alarmed
by
the
book
it
was
loudly
insisted
that
it
promoted
atheism
looking
back
along
the
line
of
thought
which
has
since
been
developed
one
feels
that
the
older
theologians
ought
to
have
put
up
thanksgivings
for
chambers
theory
and
prayers
that
it
might
prove
true
the
more
serious
result
was
that
it
accustomed
men
minds
to
a
belief
in
evolution
as
in
some
form
possible
or
even
probable
in
this
way
it
was
provisionally
of
service
eight
years
later
herbert
spencer
published
an
essay
contrasting
the
theories
of
creation
and
evolution
reasoning
with
great
force
in
favour
of
the
latter
showing
that
species
had
undoubtedly
been
modified
by
circumstances
but
still
only
few
and
chosen
men
saw
the
significance
of
all
these
lines
of
reasoning
which
had
been
converging
during
so
many
years
toward
one
conclusion
on
july
there
were
read
before
the
linnaean
society
at
london
two
papers
one
presented
by
charles
darwin
the
other
by
alfred
russel
wallace
and
with
the
reading
of
these
papers
the
doctrine
of
evolution
by
natural
selection
was
born
then
and
there
a
fatal
breach
was
made
in
the
great
theological
barrier
of
the
continued
fixity
of
species
since
the
creation
the
story
of
these
papers
the
scientific
world
knows
by
heart
how
charles
darwin
having
been
sent
to
the
university
of
cambridge
to
fit
him
for
the
anglican
priesthood
left
it
in
to
go
upon
the
scientific
expedition
of
the
beagle
how
for
five
years
he
studied
with
wonderful
vigour
and
acuteness
the
problems
of
life
as
revealed
on
land
and
at
sea
among
volcanoes
and
coral
reefs
in
forests
and
on
the
sands
from
the
tropics
to
the
arctic
regions
how
in
the
cape
verde
and
the
galapagos
islands
and
in
brazil
patagonia
and
australia
he
interrogated
nature
with
matchless
persistency
and
skill
how
he
returned
unheralded
quietly
settled
down
to
his
work
and
soon
set
the
world
thinking
over
its
first
published
results
such
as
his
book
on
coral
reefs
and
the
monograph
on
the
cirripedia
and
finally
how
he
presented
his
paper
and
followed
it
up
with
treatises
which
made
him
one
of
the
great
leaders
in
the
history
of
human
thought
the
scientific
world
realizes
too
more
and
more
the
power
of
character
shown
by
darwin
in
all
this
great
career
the
faculty
of
silence
the
reserve
of
strength
seen
in
keeping
his
great
thought
his
idea
of
evolution
by
natural
selection
under
silent
study
and
meditation
for
nearly
twenty
years
giving
no
hint
of
it
to
the
world
at
large
but
working
in
every
field
to
secure
proofs
or
disproofs
and
accumulating
masses
of
precious
material
for
the
solution
of
the
questions
involved
to
one
man
only
did
he
reveal
his
thought
to
joseph
hooker
to
whom
in
under
the
seal
of
secrecy
he
gave
a
summary
of
his
conclusions
not
until
fourteen
years
later
occurred
the
event
which
showed
him
that
the
fulness
of
time
had
come
the
letter
from
alfred
russel
wallace
to
whom
in
brilliant
researches
during
the
decade
from
to
in
brazil
and
in
the
malay
archipelago
the
same
truth
of
evolution
by
natural
selection
had
been
revealed
among
the
proofs
that
scientific
study
does
no
injury
to
the
more
delicate
shades
of
sentiment
is
the
story
of
this
letter
with
it
wallace
sent
darwin
a
memoir
asking
him
to
present
it
to
the
linnaean
society
on
examining
it
darwin
found
that
wallace
had
independently
arrived
at
conclusions
similar
to
his
own
possibly
had
deprived
him
of
fame
but
darwin
was
loyal
to
his
friend
and
his
friend
remained
ever
loyal
to
him
he
publicly
presented
the
paper
from
wallace
with
his
own
conclusions
and
the
date
of
this
presentation
july
separates
two
epochs
in
the
history
not
merely
of
natural
science
but
of
human
thought
in
the
following
year
came
the
first
instalment
of
his
work
in
its
fuller
development
his
book
on
the
origin
of
species
in
this
book
one
at
least
of
the
main
secrets
at
the
heart
of
the
evolutionary
process
which
had
baffled
the
long
line
of
investigators
and
philosophers
from
the
days
of
aristotle
was
more
broadly
revealed
the
effective
mechanism
of
evolution
was
shown
at
work
in
three
ascertained
facts
in
the
struggle
for
existence
among
organized
beings
in
the
survival
of
the
fittest
and
in
heredity
these
facts
were
presented
with
such
minute
research
wide
observation
patient
collation
transparent
honesty
and
judicial
fairness
that
they
at
once
commanded
the
world
attention
it
was
the
outcome
of
thirty
years
work
and
thought
by
a
worker
and
thinker
of
genius
but
it
was
yet
more
than
that
it
was
the
outcome
also
of
the
work
and
thought
of
another
man
of
genius
fifty
years
before
the
book
of
malthus
on
the
principle
of
population
mainly
founded
on
the
fact
that
animals
increase
in
a
geometrical
ratio
and
therefore
if
unchecked
must
encumber
the
earth
had
been
generally
forgotten
and
was
only
recalled
with
a
sneer
but
the
genius
of
darwin
recognised
in
it
a
deeper
meaning
and
now
the
thought
of
malthus
was
joined
to
the
new
current
meditating
upon
it
in
connection
with
his
own
observations
of
the
luxuriance
of
nature
darwin
had
arrived
at
his
doctrine
of
natural
selection
and
survival
of
the
fittest
as
the
great
dogmatic
barrier
between
the
old
and
new
views
of
the
universe
was
broken
down
the
flood
of
new
thought
pouring
over
the
world

and
nourished
strong
growths

every
field

the

a
few
years

so
deeply
lamented

seemed

formerly
without

by

authority

source

to
be
especially
mentioned
louis
agassiz
a
great
investigator
an
inspired
and
inspiring
teacher
a
noble
man
he
had
received
and
elaborated
a
theory
of
animated
creation
which
he
could
not
readily
change
in
his
heart
and
mind
still
prevailed
the
atmosphere
of
the
little
swiss
parsonage
in
which
he
was
born
and
his
religious
and
moral
nature
so
beautiful
to
all
who
knew
him
was
especially
repelled
by
sundry
evolutionists
who
in
their
zeal
as
neophytes
made
proclamations
seeming
to
have
a
decidedly
irreligious
if
not
immoral
bearing
in
addition
to
this
was
the
direction
his
thinking
had
received
from
cuvier
both
these
influences
combined
to
prevent
his
acceptance
of
the
new
view
he
was
the
third
great
man
who
had
thrown
his
influence
as
a
barrier
across
the
current
of
evolutionary
thought
linnaeus
in
the
second
half
of

eighteenth
century
cuvier
in
the
first
half
and
agassiz
in
the
second
half
of

nineteenth
all
made
the

effort
each
remains
great
but
not
all
of
them
together
could
arrest
the
current
strong
efforts
throughout
the
united
states
and
indeed
throughout
europe
to
check
it
really
promoted
it
from
the
great
museum
he
had
founded
at
cambridge
from
his
summer
school
at
penikese
from
his
lecture
rooms
at
harvard
and
cornell
his
disciples
went
forth
full
of
love
and
admiration
for
him
full
of
enthusiasm
which
he
had
stirred
and
into
fields
which
he
had
indicated
but
their
powers
which
he
had
aroused
and
strengthened
were
devoted
to
developing
the
truth
he
failed
to
recognise
shaler
verrill
packard

wilder
jordan
with
a
multitude
of
others
and
especially
the
son
who
bore
his
honoured
name
did
justice
to
his
memory
by
applying
what
they
had
received
from
him
to
research
under
inspiration
of
the
new
revelation
still
another
man
deserves
especial
gratitude
and
honour
in
this
progress
edward
livingston
youmans
he
was
perhaps
the
first
in
america
to
recognise
the
vast
bearings
of
the
truths
presented
by
darwin
wallace
and
spencer
he
became
the
apostle
of
these
truths
sacrificing
the
brilliant
career
on
which
he
had
entered
as
a
public
lecturer
subordinating
himself
to
the
three
leaders
and
giving
himself
to
editorial
drudgery
in
the
stimulation
of
research
and
the
announcement
of
results
in
support
of
the
new
doctrine
came
a
world
of
new
proofs
those
which
darwin
himself
added
in
regard
to
the
of
plants
and
which
he
had
adopted
from
embryology
led
the
way
and
these
were
followed
by
the
discoveries
of
wallace
bates
huxley

a

a
reminiscence
of
my
own
enables
me
to
appreciate
his
deep
ethical
and
religious
feeling
i
was
passing
the
day
with
him
at
nahant
in
consulting
him
regarding
candidates
for
various
scientific
chairs
at
the
newly
established
cornell
university
in
which
he
took
a
deep
interest
as
we
discussed
one
after
another
of
the
candidates
he
suddenly
said
who
is
to
be
your
professor
of
moral
philosophy
that
is
a
far
more
important
position
than
all
the
others
iv
the
final
effort
of
theology
darwin
origin
of
species
had
come
into
the
theological
world
like
a
plough
into
an
everywhere
those
thus
rudely
awakened
from
their
old
comfort
and
repose
had
swarmed
forth
angry
and
confused
reviews
sermons
books
light
and
heavy
came
flying
at
the
new
thinker
from
all
sides
the
keynote
was
struck
at
once
in
the
quarterly
review
by
wilberforce
bishop
of
oxford
he
declared
that
darwin
was
guilty
of
a
tendency
to
limit
god
glory
in
creation
that
the
principle
of
natural
selection
is
absolutely
incompatible
with
the
word
of
god
that
it
contradicts
the
revealed
relations
of
creation
to
its
creator
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
fulness
of
his
glory
that
it
is
a
dishonouring
view
of
nature
and
that
there
is
a
simpler
explanation
of
the
presence
of
these
strange
forms
among
the
works
of
god
that
explanation
being
the
fall
of
adam
nor
did
the
bishop
efforts
end
here
at
the
meeting
of
the
british
association
for
the
advancement
of
science
he
again
disported
himself
in
the
tide
of
popular
applause
referring
to
the
ideas
of
darwin
who
was
absent
on
account
of
illness
he
congratulated
himself
in
a
public
speech
that
he
was
not
descended
from
a
monkey
the
reply
came
from
huxley
who
said
in
substance
if
i
had
to
choose
i
would
prefer
to
be
a
descendant
of
a
humble
monkey
rather
than
of
a
man
who
employs
his
knowledge
and
eloquence
in
misrepresenting
those
who
are
wearing
out
their
lives
in
the
search
for
truth
this
shot
reverberated
through
england
and
indeed
through
other
countries
the
utterances
of
this
the
most
brilliant
prelate
of
the
anglican
church
received
a
sort
of
antiphonal
response
from
the
leaders
of
the
english
catholics
in
an
address
before
the
academia
which
had
been
organized
to
combat
science
falsely
so
called
cardinal
manning
declared
his
abhorrence
of
the
new
view
of
nature
and
described
it
as
a
brutal
philosophy
to
wit
there
is
no
god
and
the
ape
is
our
adam
these
attacks
from
such
eminent
sources
set
the
clerical
fashion
for
several
years
one
distinguished
clerical
reviewer
in
spite
of
thirty
years
of
quiet
labour
and
in
spite
of
the
powerful
summing
up
of
his
book
prefaced
a
diatribe
by
saying
that
darwin
might
have
been
more
modest
had
he
given
some
slight
reason
for
dissenting
from
the
views
generally
entertained
another
distinguished
clergyman
of
a
protestant
institute
to
combat
dangerous
science
declared
darwinism
an
attempt
to
dethrone
god
another
critic
spoke
of
persons
accepting
the
darwinian
views
as
under
the
frenzied
inspiration
of
the
inhaler
of
mephitic
gas
and
of
darwin
argument
as
a
jungle
of
fanciful
assumption
another
spoke
of
darwin
views
as
suggesting
that
god
is
dead
and
declared
that
darwin
work
does
open
violence
to
everything
which
the
creator
himself
has
told
us
in
the
scriptures
of
the
methods
and
results
of
his
work
still
another
theological
authority
asserted
if
the
darwinian
theory
is
true
genesis
is
a
lie
the
whole
framework
of
the
book
of
life
falls
to
pieces
and
the
revelation
of
god
to
man
as
we
christians
know
it
is
a
delusion
and
a
snare
another
who
had
shown
excellent
qualities
as
an
observing
naturalist
declared
the
darwinian
view
a
huge
imposture
from
the
beginning
echoes
came
from
america
one
review
the
organ
of
the
most
widespread
of
american
religious
sects
declared
that
darwin
was
attempting
to
befog
and
to
pettifog
the
whole
question
another
denounced
views
as
infidelity
another
representing
the
american
branch
of
the
anglican
church
poured
contempt
over
darwin
as
sophistical
and
illogical
and
then
plunged
into
an
exceedingly
dangerous
line
of
argument
in
the
following
words
if
this
hypothesis
be
true
then
is
the
bible
an
unbearable
fiction
then
have
christians
for
nearly
two
thousand
years
been
duped
by
a
monstrous
lie
darwin
requires
us
to
disbelieve
the
authoritative
word
of
the
creator
a
leading
journal
representing
the
same
church
took
pains
to
show
the
evolution
theory
to
be
as
contrary
to
the
explicit
declarations
of
the
new
testament
as
to
those
of
the
old
and
said
if
we
have
all
men
and
monkeys
oysters
and
eagles
developed
from
an
original
germ
then
is
paul

flesh
is
not
the
same
flesh
there
is
one
kind
of
flesh
of
men
another
of
beasts
another
of
fishes
and
another
of
birds
untrue
another
echo
came
from
australia
where
perry
lord
bishop
of
melbourne
in
a
most
bitter
book
on
science
and
the
bible
declared
that
the
obvious
object
of
chambers
darwin
and
huxley
is
to
produce
in
their
readers
a
disbelief
of
the
bible
nor
was
the
older
branch
of
the
church
to
be
left
behind
in
this
chorus
bayma
in
the
catholic
world
declared
darwin
is
we
have
reason
to
believe
the
mouthpiece
or
chief
trumpeter
of
that
infidel
clique
whose
object
is
to
do
away
with
all
idea
of
a
god
worthy
of
especial
note
as
showing
the
determination
of
the
theological
side
at
that
period
was
the
foundation
of
organizations
to
combat
the
new
ideas
first
to
be
noted
is
the
academia
planned
by
cardinal
wiseman
in
a
circular
letter
the
cardinal
usually
so
moderate
and
just
sounded
an
alarm
and
summed
up
by
saying
now
it
is
for
the
church
which
alone
possesses
divine
certainty
and
divine
discernment
to
place
itself
at
once
in
the
front
of
a
movement
which
threatens
even
the
fragmentary
remains
of
christian
belief
in
england
the
necessary
permission
was
obtained
from
rome
the
academia
was
founded
and
the
divine
discernment
of
the
church
was
seen
in
the
utterances
which
came
from
it
such
as
those
of
cardinal
manning
which
every
thoughtful
catholic
would
now
desire
to
recall
and
in
the
diatribes
of
laing
which
only
aroused
laughter
on
all
sides
a
similar
effort
was
seen
in
protestant
quarters
the
victoria
institute
was
created
and
perhaps
the
most
noted
utterance
which
ever
came
from
it
was

if

development
of
man
out
of

brutal
condition
then
the

in

is
utterly
annihilated
rougemont
in
switzerland
called
for
a
crusade
against
the
obnoxious
doctrine
luthardt
professor
of
theology
at
leipsic
declared
the
idea
of
creation
belongs
to
religion
and
not
to
natural
science
the
whole
superstructure
of
personal
religion
is
built
upon
the
doctrine
of
creation
and
he
showed
the
evolution
theory
to
be
in
direct
contradiction
to
holy
writ
but
in
came
an
event
which
brought
serious
confusion
to
the
theological
camp
sir
charles
lyell
the
most
eminent
of
living
geologists
a
man
of
deeply
christian
feeling
and
of
exceedingly
cautious
temper
who
had
opposed
the
evolution
theory
of
lamarck
and
declared
his
adherence
to
the
idea
of
successive
creations
then
published
his
work
on
the
antiquity
of
man
and
in
this
and
other
utterances
showed
himself
a
complete
though
unwilling
convert
to
the
fundamental
ideas
of
darwin
the
blow
was
serious
in
many
ways
and
especially
so
in
two
first
as
withdrawing
all
foundation
in
fact
from
the
scriptural
chronology
and
secondly
as
discrediting
the
creation
theory
the
blow
was
not
unexpected
in
various
review
articles
against
the
darwinian
theory
there
had
been
appeals
to
lyell
at
times
almost
piteous
not
to
flinch
from
the
truths
he
had
formerly
proclaimed
but
lyell
like
the
honest
man
he
was
yielded
unreservedly
to
the
mass
of
new
proofs
arrayed
on
the
side
of
evolution
against
that
of
creation
at
the
same
time
came
huxley
man
place
in
nature
giving
new
and
most
cogent
arguments
in
favour
of
evolution
by
natural
selection
in
was
published
darwin
descent
of
man
its
doctrine
had
been
anticipated
by
critics
of
his
previous
books
but
it
made
none
the
less
a
great
stir
again
the
opposing
army
trooped
forth
though
evidently
with
much
less
heart
than
before
a
few
were
very
violent
the
dublin
university
magazine
after
the
traditional
hibernian
fashion
charged
darwin
with
seeking
to
displace
god
by
the
unerring
action
of
vagary
and
with
being
resolved
to
hunt
god
out
of
the
world
but
most
notable
from
the
side
of
the
older
church
was
the
elaborate
answer
to
darwin
book
by
the
eminent
french
catholic
physician
constantin
james
in
his
work
on
darwinism
or
the
published
at
paris
in
james
not
only
refuted
darwin
scientifically
but
poured
contempt
on
his
book
calling
it
a
fairy
tale
and
insisted
that
a
work
so
fantastic
and
so
burlesque
was
doubtless
only
a
huge
joke
like
erasmus
praise
of
folly
or
montesquieu
persian
letters
the
princes
of
the
church
were
delighted
the
cardinal
archbishop
of
paris
assured
the
author
that
the
book
had
become
his
spiritual
reading
and
begged
him
to
send
a
copy
to
the
pope
himself
his
holiness
pope
pius
ix
acknowledged
the
gift
in
a
remarkable
letter
he
thanked
his
dear
son
the
writer
for
the
book
in
which
he
refutes
so
well
the
aberrations
of
darwinism
a
system
his
holiness
adds
which
is
repugnant
at
once
to
history
to
the
tradition
of
all
peoples
to
exact
science
to
observed
facts
and
even
to
reason
herself
would
seem
to
need
no
refutation
did
not
alienation
from
god
and
the
leaning
toward
materialism
due
to
depravity
eagerly
seek
a
support
in
all
this
tissue
of
fables
and
in
fact
pride
after
rejecting
the
creator
of
all
things
and
proclaiming
man
independent
wishing
him
to
be
his
own
king
his
own
priest
and
his
own
god
pride
goes
so
far
as
to
degrade
man
himself
to
the
level
of
the
unreasoning
brutes
perhaps
even
of
lifeless
matter
thus
unconsciously
confirming
the
divine
declaration
when
pride
cometh
then
cometh
shame
but
the
corruption
of
this
age
the
machinations
of
the
perverse
the
danger
of
the
simple
demand
that
such
fancies
altogether
absurd
though
they
are
should
since
they
borrow
the
mask
of
science
be
refuted
by
true
science
wherefore
the
pope
thanked
james
for
his
book
so
opportune
and
so
perfectly
appropriate
to
the
exigencies
of
our
time
and
bestowed
on
him
the
apostolic
benediction
nor
was
this
brief
all
with
it
there
came
a
second
creating
the
author
an
officer
of
the
papal
order
of
sylvester
the
cardinal
archbishop
assured
the
delighted
physician
that
such
a
double
honour
of
brief
and
brevet
was
perhaps
unprecedented
and
suggested
only
that
in
a
new
edition
of
his
book
he
should
insist
a
little
more
on
the
relation
existing
between
the
narratives
of
genesis
and
the
discoveries
of
modern
science
in
such
fashion
as
to
convince
the
most
incredulous
of
their
perfect
agreement
the
prelate
urged
also
a
more
dignified
title
the
proofs
of
this
new
edition
were
accordingly
all
submitted
to
his
eminence
and
in
it
appeared
as
moses
and
darwin
the
man
of
genesis
compared
with
the
or
religious
education
opposed
to
atheistic
no
wonder
the
cardinal
embraced
the
author
thanking
him
in
the
name
of
science
and
religion
we
have
at
last
he
declared
a
handbook
which
we
can
safely
put
into
the
hands
of
youth
scarcely
less
vigorous
were
the
champions
of
english
protestant
orthodoxy
in
an
address
at
liverpool
gladstone
remarked
upon
the
grounds
of
what
is
termed
evolution
god
is
relieved
of
the
labour
of
creation
in
the
name
of
unchangeable
laws
he
is
discharged
from
governing
the
world
and
when
herbert
spencer
called
his
attention
to
the
fact
that
newton
with
the

but
it
was
noted
that
this
second
series
of
attacks
on
the

of
man
differed
in
one
remarkable
respect
so
far
as
england
was
concerned
from
those
which
had
been
made
over
ten
years
before
on
the
origin
of
species
while
everything
was
done
to
discredit
darwin
to
pour
contempt
upon
him
and
even
of
all
things
in
the
world
to
make
him
the
gentlest
of
mankind
only
occupied
with
the
scientific
side
of
the
problem
a
persecutor
of
christianity
while
his
followers
were
represented
more
and
more
as
charlatans
or
dupes
there
began
to
be
in
the
most
influential
quarters
careful
avoidance
of
the
old
argument
that
evolution
even
by
natural
selection
contradicts
scripture
it
began
to
be
felt
that
this
was
dangerous
ground
the
defection
of
lyell
had
perhaps
more
than
anything
else
started
the
question
among
theologians
who
had
preserved
some
equanimity
what
if
after
all
the
darwinian
theory
should
prove
to
be
true
recollections
of
the
position
in
which
the
roman
church
found
itself
after
the
establishment
of
the
doctrines
of
copernicus
and
galileo
naturally
came
into
the
minds
of
the
more
thoughtful
in
germany
this
consideration
does
not
seem
to
have
occurred
at
quite
so
early
a
day
one
eminent
lutheran
clergyman
at
magdeburg
called
on
his
hearers
to
choose
between
darwin
and
religion
delitszch
in
his
new
commentary
on
genesis
attempted
to
bring
science
back
to
recognise
human
sin
as
an
important
factor
in
creation
heinrich
ewald
while
carefully
avoiding
any
sharp
conflict
between
the
scriptural
doctrine
and
evolution
comforted
himself
by
covering
darwin
and
his
followers
with
contempt
christlieb
in
his
address
before
the
evangelical
alliance
at
new
york
in
simply
took
the
view
that
the
tendencies
of
the
darwinian
theory
were
toward
infidelity
but
declined
to
make
any
serious
battle
on
biblical
grounds
the
jesuit
father
pesch
in
holland
drew
up
in
latin
after
the
old
scholastic
manner
a
sort
of
general
indictment
of
evolution
of
which
one
may
say
that
it
was
interesting
as
interesting
as
the
display
of
a
troop
in
chain
armour
and
with
on
a
battlefield
from
america
there
came
new
echoes
among
the
myriad
attacks
on
the
darwinian
theory
by
protestants
and
catholics
two
should
be
especially
mentioned
the
first
of
these
was
by
noah
porter
president
of
yale
college
an
excellent
scholar
an
interesting
writer
a
noble
man
broadly
tolerant
combining
in
his
thinking
a
curious
mixture
of
radicalism
and
conservatism
while
giving
great
latitude
to
the
evolutionary
teaching
in
the
university
under
his
care
he
felt
it
his
duty
upon
one
occasion
to
avow
his
disbelief
in
it
but
he
was
too
wise
a
man
to
suggest
any
necessary
antagonism
between
it
and
the
scriptures
he
confined
himself
mainly
to
pointing
out
the
tendency
of
the
evolution
doctrine
in
this
form
toward
agnosticism
and
pantheism
to
those
who
knew
and
loved
him
and
had
noted
the
genial
way
in
which
by
wise
neglect
he
had
allowed
scientific
studies
to
flourish
at
yale
there
was
an
amusing
side
to
all
this
within
a
stone
throw
of
his
college
rooms
was
the
museum
of
paleontology
in
which
marsh
had
laid
side
by
side
among
other
evidences
of
the
new
truth
that
wonderful
series
of
specimens
showing
the
evolution
of
the
horse
from
the
earliest
form
of
the
animal
not
larger
than
a
fox
with
five
toes
through
the
whole
series
up
to
his
present
form
and
size
that
series
which
huxley
declared
an
absolute
proof
of
the
existence
of
natural
selection
as
an
agent
in
evolution
in
spite
of
the
veneration
and
love
which
all
yale
men
felt
for
president
porter
it
was
hardly
to
be
expected
that
these
particular
arguments
of
his
would
have
much
permanent
effect
upon
them
when
there
was
constantly
before
their
eyes
so
convincing
a
refutation
but
a
far
more
determined
opponent
was
the
rev
hodge
of
princeton
his
anger
toward
the
evolution
doctrine
was
bitter
he
denounced
it
as
thoroughly
atheistic
he
insisted
that
christians
have
a
right
to
protest
against
the
arraying
of
probabilities
against
the
clear
evidence
of
the
scriptures
he
even
censured
so
orthodox
a
writer
as
the
duke
of
argyll
and
declared
that
the
darwinian
theory
of
natural
selection
is
utterly
inconsistent
with
the
scriptures
and
that
an
absent
god
who
does
nothing
is
to
us
no
god
that
to
ignore
design
as
manifested
in
god
creation
is
to
dethrone
god
that
a
denial
of
design
in
nature
is
virtually
a
denial
of
god
and
that
no
teleologist
can
be
a
darwinian
even
more
uncompromising
was
another
of
the
leading
authorities
at
the
same
university
the
rev
duffield
he
declared
war
not
only
against
darwin
but
even
against
men
like
asa
gray
le
conte
and
others
who
had
attempted
to
reconcile
the
new
theory
with
the
bible
he
insisted
that
evolutionism
and
the
scriptural
account
of
the
origin
of
man
are
irreconcilable
that
the
darwinian
theory
is
in
direct
conflict
with
the
teaching
of
the
apostle
scripture
is
given
by
inspiration
of
god
he
pointed
out
in
his
opposition
to
darwin
descent
of
man
and
lyell
antiquity
of
man
that
in
the
bible
the
genealogical
links
which
connect
the
israelites
in
egypt
with
adam
and
eve
in
eden
are
explicitly
given
these
utterances
of
duffield
culminated
in
a
declaration
which
deserves
to
be
cited
as
showing
that
a
presbyterian
minister
can
deal
damnation
round
the
land
ex
cathedra
in
a
fashion
quite
equal
to
that
of
popes
and
bishops
it
is
as
follows
if
the
development
theory
of
the
origin
of
man
wrote
duffield
in
the
princeton
review
shall
in
a
little
while
take
its
place
as
doubtless
it
will
with
other
exploded
scientific
speculations
then
they
who
accept
it
with
its
proper
logical
consequences
will
in
the
life
to
come
have
their
portion
with
those
who
in
this
life
not
god
and
obey
not
the
gospel
of
his
son
fortunately
at
about
the
time
when
darwin
descent
of
man
was
published
there
had
come
into
princeton
university
deus
ex
machina
in
the
person
of
james
mccosh
called
to
the
presidency
he
at
once
took
his
stand
against
teachings
so
dangerous
to
christianity
as
those
of
drs
hodge
duffield
and
their
associates
in
one
of
his
personal
confidences
he
has
let
us
into
the
secret
of
this
matter
with
that
hard
scotch
sense
which
thackeray
had
applauded
in
his
verses
he
saw
that
the
most
dangerous
thing
which
could
be
done
to
christianity
at
princeton
was
to
reiterate
in
the
university
pulpit
week
after
week
solemn
declarations
that
if
evolution
by
natural
selection
or
indeed
evolution
at
all
be
true
the
scriptures
are
false
he
tells
us
that
he
saw
that
this
was
the
certain
way
to
make
the
students
unbelievers
he
therefore
not
only
checked
this
dangerous
preaching
but
preached
an
opposite
doctrine
with
him
began
the
inevitable
compromise
and
in
spite
of
mutterings
against
him
as
a
darwinian
he
carried
the
day
whatever
may
be
thought
of
his
general
system
of
philosophy
no
one
can
deny
his
great
service
in
neutralizing
the
teachings
of
his
predecessors
and
colleagues
so
dangerous
to
all
that
is
essential
in
christianity
other
divines
of
strong
sense
in
other
parts
of
the
country
began
to
take
similar
ground
namely
that
men
could
be
christians
and
at
the
same
time
darwinians
there
appeared
indeed
here
and
there
curious
discrepancies
thus
in
the
monthly
religious
magazine
of
boston
congratulated
its
readers
that
the
rev
burr
had
demolished
the
evolution
theory
knocking
the
breath
of
life
out
of
it
and
throwing
it
to
the
dogs
this
amazing
performance
by
the
rev
burr
was
repeated
in
a
very
striking
way
by
bishop
keener
before
the
oecumenical
council
of
methodism
at
washington
in
in
what
the
newspapers
described
as
an
admirable
speech
he
refuted
evolution
doctrines
by
saying
that
evolutionists
had
only
to
make
a
journey
of
twelve
hours
from
the
place
where
he
was
then
standing
to
find
together
the
bones
of
the
muskrat
the
opossum
the
coprolite
and
the
ichthyosaurus
he
asserted
that
agassiz
whom
the
good
bishop
like
so
many
others
seemed
to
think
an
evolutionist
when
he
visited
these
beds
near
charleston
declared
these
old
beds
have
set
me
crazy
they
have
destroyed
the
work
of
a
lifetime
and
the
methodist
prelate
ended
by
saying
now
gentlemen
brethren
take
these
facts
home
with
you
get
down
and
look
at
them
this
is
the
watch
that
was
under
the
steam
hammer
the
doctrine
of
evolution
and
this
steam
hammer
is
the
wonderful
deposit
of
the
ashley
beds
exhibitions
like
these
availed
little
while
the
good
bishop
amid
vociferous
applause
thus
made
comically
evident
his
belief
that
agassiz
was
a
darwinian
and
a
coprolite
an
animal
scientific
men
were
recording
in
all
parts
of
the
world
facts
confirming
the
dreaded
theory
of
an
evolution
by
natural
selection
while
the
rev
burr
was
so
loudly
praised
for
throwing
darwinism
to
the
dogs
marsh
was
completing
his
series
leading
from
the
ungulates
to
the
horse
while
tayler
lewis
at
union
and
drs
hodge
and
duffield
at
princeton
were
showing
that
if
evolution
be
true
the
biblical
accounts
must
be
false
the
indefatigable
yale
professor
was
showing
his
cretaceous
birds
and
among
them
hesperornis
and
ichthyornis
with
teeth
while
in
germany
luthardt
schund
and
their
compeers
were
demonstrating
that
scripture
requires
a
belief
in
special
and
separate
creations
the
archaeopteryx
showing
a
most
remarkable
connection
between
birds
and
reptiles
was
discovered
while
in
france
monseigneur
segur
and
others
were
indulging
in
diatribes
against
a
certain
darwin
gaudry
and
filhol
were
discovering
a
striking
series
of
missing
links
among
the
carnivora
in
view
of
the
proofs
accumulating
in
favour
of
the
new
evolutionary
hypothesis
the
change
in
the
tone
of
controlling
theologians
was
now
rapid
from
all
sides
came
evidences
of
desire
to
compromise
with
the
theory
strict
adherents
of
the
biblical
text
pointed
significantly
to
the
verses
in
genesis
in
which
the
earth
and
sea
were
made
to
bring
forth
birds
and
fishes
and
man
was
created
out
of
the
dust
of
the
ground
men
of
larger
mind
like
kingsley
and
farrar
with
english
and
american
broad
churchmen
generally
took
ground
directly
in
darwin
favour
even
whewell
took
pains
to
show
that
there
might
be
such
a
thing
as
a
darwinian
argument
for
design
in
nature
and
the
rev
samuel
houghton
of
the
royal
society
gave
interesting
suggestions
of
a
divine
design
in
evolution
both
the
great
english
universities
received
the
new
teaching
as
a
leaven
at
oxford
in
the
very
front
of
the
high
church
party
at
keble
college
was
elaborated
a
statement
that
the
evolution
doctrine
is
an
advance
in
our
theological
thinking
and
temple
bishop
of
london
perhaps
the
most
influential
thinker
then
in
the
anglican
episcopate
accepted
the
new
revelation
in
the
following
words
it
seems
something
more
majestic
more
befitting
him
to
whom
a
thousand
years
are
as
one
day
thus
to
impress
his
will
once
for
all
on
his
creation
and
provide
for
all
the
countless
varieties
by
this
one
original
impress
than
by
special
acts
of
creation
to
be
perpetually
modifying
what
he
had
previously
made
in
scotland
the
duke
of
argyll
head
and
front
of
the
orthodox
party
dissenting
in
many
respects
from
darwin
full
conclusions
made
concessions
which
badly
shook
the
old
position
curiously
enough
from
the
roman
catholic
church
bitter
as
some
of
its
writers
had
been
now
came
argument
to
prove
that
the
catholic
faith
does
not
prevent
any
one
from
holding
the
darwinian
theory
and
especially
a
declaration
from
an
authority
eminent
among
american
catholics
a
declaration
which
has
a
very
curious
sound
but
which
it
would
be
ungracious
to
find
fault
with
that
the
doctrine
of
evolution
is
no
more
in
opposition
to
the
doctrine
of
the
catholic
church
than
is
the
copernican
theory
or
that
of
galileo
here
and
there
indeed
men
of
science
like
dawson
mivart
and
wigand
in
view
of
theological
considerations
sought
to
make
conditions
but
the
current
was
too
strong
and
eminent
theologians
in
every
country
accepted
natural
selection
as
at
least
a
very
important
part
in
the
mechanism
of
evolution
at
the
death
of
darwin
it
was
felt
that
there
was
but
one
place
in
england
where
his
body
should
be
laid
and
that
this
place
was
next
the
grave
of
sir
isaac
newton
in
westminster
abbey
the
noble
address
of
canon
farrar
at
his
funeral
was
echoed
from
many
pulpits
in
europe
and
america
and
theological
opposition
as
such
was
ended
occasionally
appeared
it
is
true
a
survival
of
the
old
feeling
the
rev
laing
referred
to
the
burial
of
darwin
in
westminster
abbey
as
a
proof
that
england
is
no
longer
a
christian
country
and
added
that
this
burial
was
a
desecration
that
this
honour
was
given
him
because
he
had
been
the
chief
promoter
of
the
mock
doctrine
of
evolution
of
the
species
and
the
ape
descent
of
man
still
another
of
these
belated
prophets
was
of
all
men
thomas
carlyle
soured
and
embittered
in
the
same
spirit
which
led
him
to
find
more
heroism
in
a
marauding
viking
or
in
one
of
frederick
the
generals
than
in
washington
or
lincoln
or
grant
and
which
caused
him
to
see
in
the
american
civil
war
only
the
burning
out
of
a
foul
chimney
he
with
the
petulance
natural
to
a
dyspeptic
eunuch
railed
at
darwin
as
an
apostle
of
dirt
worship
the
last
echoes
of
these
utterances
reverberated
between
scotland
and
america
in
the
former
country
in
the
rev
lee
issued
a
volume
declaring
that
if
the
darwinian
view
be
true
there
is
no
place
for
god
that
by
no
method
of
interpretation
can
the
language
of
holy
scripture
be
made
wide
enough
to
the
theory
of
man
natural
history
that
darwinism
reverses
the
revelation
of
god
and
implies
utter
blasphemy
against
the
divine
and
human
character
of
our
incarnate
lord
and
he
was
pleased
to
call
darwin
and
his
followers
gospellers
of
the
gutter
in
one
of
the
intellectual
centres
of
america
the
editor
of
a
periodical
called
the
christian
urged
frantically
that
the
battle
be
set
in
array
and
that
men
find
out
who
is
on
the
lord
side
and
who
is
on
the
side
of
the
devil
and
the
monkeys
to
the
honour
of
the
church
of
england
it
should
be
recorded
that
a
considerable
number
of
her
truest
men
opposed
such
utterances
as
these
and
that
one
of
them
farrar
archdeacon
of
westminster
made
a
protest
worthy
to
be
held
in
perpetual
remembrance
while
confessing
his
own
inability
to
accept
fully
the
new
scientific
belief
he
said
we
should
consider
it
disgraceful
and
humiliating
to
try
to
shake
it
by
an
ad
captandum
argument
or
by
a
platform
appeal
to
the
unfathomable
ignorance
and
unlimited
arrogance
of
a
prejudiced
assembly
we
should
blush
to
meet
it
with
an
anathema
or
a
sneer
all
opposition
had
availed
nothing
darwin
work
and
fame
were
secure
as
men
looked
back
over
his
beautiful
life
simple
honest
tolerant
kindly
and
thought
upon
his
great
labours
in
the
search
for
truth
all
the
attacks
faded
into
nothingness
there
were
indeed
some
dark
spots
which
as
time
goes
on
appear
darker
at
trinity
college
cambridge
whewell
the
omniscient
author
of
the
history
of
the
inductive
sciences
refused
to
allow
a
copy
of
the
origin
of
species
to
be
placed
in
the
library
at
multitudes
of
institutions
under
theological
control
protestant
as
well
as
catholic
attempts
were
made
to
stamp
out
or
to
stifle
evolutionary
teaching
especially
was
this
true
for
a
time
in
america
and
the
case
of
the
american
college
at
beyrout
where
nearly
all
the
younger
professors
were
dismissed
for
adhering
to
darwin
views
is
worthy
of
remembrance
the
treatment
of
winchell
at
the
vanderbilt
university
in
tennessee
showed
the
same
spirit
one
of
the
truest
of
men
devoted
to
science
but
of
deeply
christian
feeling
he
was
driven
forth
for
views
which
centred
in
the
darwinian
theory
still
more
striking
was
the
case
of
woodrow
he
had
about
been
appointed
to
a
professorship
of
natural
science
as
connected
with
revealed
religion
in
the
presbyterian
seminary
at
columbia
south
carolina
he
was
a
devoted
christian
man
and
his
training
had
led
him
to
accept
the
presbyterian
standards
of
faith
with
great
gifts
for
scientific
study
he
visited
europe
made
a
most
conscientious
examination
of
the
main
questions
under
discussion
and
adopted
the
chief
points
in
the
doctrine
of
evolution
by
natural
selection
a
struggle
soon
began
a
movement
hostile
to
him
grew
more
and
more
determined
and
at
last
in
spite
of
the
efforts
made
in
his
behalf
by
the
directors
of
the
seminary
and
by
a
large
and
minority
in
the
representative
bodies
controlling
it
an
orthodox
storm
raised
by
the
delegates
from
various
presbyterian
bodies
drove
him
from
his
post
fortunately
he
was
received
into
a
professorship
at
the
university
of
south
carolina
where
he
has
since
taught
with
more
power
than
ever
before
this
testimony
to
the
faith
by
american
provincial
protestantism
was
very
properly
echoed
from
spanish
provincial
catholicism
in
the
year
a
spanish
colonial
man
of
science
chil
y
marango
published
a
work
on
the
canary
islands
but
chil
had
the
imprudence
to
sketch
in
his
introduction
the
modern
hypothesis
of
evolution
and
to
exhibit
some
proofs
found
in
the
canary
islands
of
the
barbarism
of
primitive
man
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
under
the
lead
of
bishop
urquinaona
y
bidot
at
once
grappled
with
this
new
idea
by
a
solemn
act
they
declared
it
falsa
impia
scandalosa
all
persons
possessing
copies
of
the
work
were
ordered
to
surrender
them
at
once
to
the
proper
ecclesiastics
and
the
author
was
placed
under
the
major
excommunication
but
all
this
opposition
may
be
reckoned
among
the
last
expiring
convulsions
of
the
old
theologic
theory
even
from
the
new
catholic
university
at
washington
has
come
an
utterance
in
favour
of
the
new
doctrine
and
in
other
universities
in
the
old
world
and
in
the
new
the
doctrine
of
evolution
by
natural
selection
has
asserted
its
right
to
full
and
honest
consideration
more
than
this
it
is
clearly
evident
that
the
stronger
men
in
the
church
have
in
these
latter
days
not
only
relinquished
the
struggle
against
science
in
this
field
but
have
determined
frankly
and
manfully
to
make
an
alliance
with
it
in
two
very
remarkable
lectures
given
in
at
the
parish
church
of
rochdale
wilson
archdeacon
of
manchester
not
only
accepted
darwinism
as
true
but
wrought
it
with
great
argumentative
power
into
a
higher
view
of
christianity
and
what
is
of
great
significance
these
sermons
were
published
by
the
same
society
for
the
promotion
of
christian
knowledge
which
only
a
few
years
before
had
published
the
most
bitter
attacks
against
the
darwinian
theory
so
too
during
the
year
henry
drummond
whose
praise
is
in
all
the
dissenting
churches
developed
a
similar
view
most
brilliantly
in
a
series
of
lectures
delivered
before
the
american
chautauqua
schools
and
published
in
one
of
the
most
widespread
of
english
orthodox
newspapers
whatever
additional
factors
may
be
added
to
natural
selection
and
darwin
himself
fully
admitted
that
there
might
be
others
the
theory
of
an
evolution
process
in
the
formation
of
the
universe
and
of
animated
nature
is
established
and
the
old
theory
of
direct
creation
is
gone
forever
in
place
of
it
science
has
given
us
conceptions
far
more
noble
and
opened
the
way
to
an
argument
for
design
infinitely
more
beautiful
than
any
ever
developed

theology

geography
i
the
form
of
the
earth
among
various
rude
tribes
we
find
survivals
of
a
primitive
idea
that
the
earth
is
a
flat
table
or
disk
ceiled
domed
or
canopied
by
the
sky
and
that
the
sky
rests
upon
the
mountains
as
pillars
such
a
belief
is
entirely
natural
it
conforms
to
the
appearance
of
things
and
hence
at
a
very
early
period
entered
into
various
theologies
in
the
civilizations
of
chaldea
and
egypt
it
was
very
fully
developed
the
assyrian
inscriptions
deciphered
in
these
latter
years
represent
the
god
marduk
as
in
the
beginning
creating
the
heavens
and
the
earth
the
earth
rests
upon
the
waters
within
it
is
the
realm
of
the
dead
above
it
is
spread
the
firmament
a
solid
dome
coming
down
to
the
horizon
on
all
sides
and
resting
upon
foundations
laid
in
the
great
waters
which
extend
around
the
earth
on
the
east
and
west
sides
of
this
domed
firmament
are
doors
through
which
the
sun
enters
in
the
morning
and
departs
at
night
above
it
extends
another
ocean
which
goes
down
to
the
ocean
surrounding
the
earth
at
the
horizon
on
all
sides
and
which
is
supported
and
kept
away
from
the
earth
by
the
firmament
above
the
firmament
and
the
upper
ocean
which
it
supports
is
the
interior
of
heaven
the
egyptians
considered
the
earth
as
a
table
flat
and
oblong
the
sky
being
its
ceiling
a
huge
firmament
of
metal
at
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
were
the
pillars
supporting
this
firmament
and
on
this
solid
sky
were
the
waters
above
the
heavens
they
believed
that
when
chaos
was
taking
form
one
of
the
gods
by
main
force
raised
the
waters
on
high
and
spread
them
out
over
the
firmament
that
on
the
under
side
of
this
solid
vault
or
ceiling
or
firmament
the
stars
were
suspended
to
light
the
earth
and
that
the
rains
were
caused
by
the
letting
down
of
the
waters
through
its
windows
this
idea
and
others
connected
with
it
seem
to
have
taken
strong
hold
of
the
egyptian
priestly
caste
entering
into
their
theology
and
sacred
science
ceilings
of
great
temples
with
stars
constellations
planets
and
signs
of

figured
upon

remain
as
striking
evidences
of
this
in

we
have
theories

they
were

these

began

a
few
of
the
fathers
of
the
church
influenced
possibly
by
pythagorean
traditions
but
certainly
by
aristotle
and
plato
were
willing
to
accept
this
view
but
the
majority
of
them
took
fright
at
once
to
them
it
seemed
fraught
with
dangers
to
scripture
by
which
of
course
they
meant
their
interpretation
of
scripture
among
the
first
who
took
up
arms
against
it
was
eusebius
in
view
of
the
new
testament
texts
indicating
the
immediately
approaching
end
of
the
world
he
endeavoured
to
turn
off
this
idea
by
bringing
scientific
studies
into
contempt
speaking
of
investigators
he
said
it
is
not
through
ignorance
of
the
things
admired
by
them
but
through
contempt
of
their
useless
labour
that
we
think
little
of
these
matters
turning
our
souls
to
better
things
basil
of
caesarea
declared
it
a
matter
of
no
interest
to
us
whether
the
earth
is
a
sphere
or
a
cylinder
or
a
disk
or
concave
in
the
middle
like
a
fan
lactantius
referred
to
the
ideas
of
those
studying
astronomy
as
bad
and
senseless
and
opposed
the
doctrine
of
the
earth
sphericity
both
from
scripture
and
reason
john
chrysostom
also
exerted
his
influence
against
this
scientific
belief
and
ephraem
syrus
the
greatest
man
of
the
old
syrian
church
widely
known
as
the
lute
of
the
holy
ghost
opposed
it
no
less
earnestly
but
the
strictly
biblical
men
of
science
such
eminent
fathers
and
bishops
as
theophilus
of
antioch
in
the
second
century
and
clement
of
alexandria
in
the
third
with
others
in
centuries
following
were
not
content
with
merely
opposing
what
they
stigmatized
as
an
old
heathen
theory
they
drew
from
their
bibles
a
new
christian
theory
to
which
one
church
authority
added
one
idea
and
another
until
it
was
fully
developed
taking
the
survival
of
various
early
traditions
given
in
the
seventh
verse
of
the
first
chapter
of
genesis
they
insisted
on
the
clear
declarations
of
scripture
that
the
earth
was
at
creation
arched
over
with
a
solid
vault
a
firmament
and
to
this
they
added
the
passages
from
isaiah
and
the
psalms
in
which
it
declared
that
the
heavens
are
stretched
out
like
a
curtain
and
again
like
a
tent
to
dwell
in
the
universe
then
is
like
a
house
the
earth
is
its
ground
floor
the
firmament
its
ceiling
under
which
the
almighty
hangs
out
the
sun
to
rule
the
day
and
the
moon
and
stars
to
rule
the
night
this
ceiling
is
also
the
floor
of
the
apartment
above
and
in
this
is
a
cistern
shaped
as
one
of
the
authorities
says
like
a
and
containing
the
waters
which
are
above
the
firmament
these
waters
are
let
down
upon
the
earth
by
the
almighty
and
his
angels
through
the
windows
of
heaven
as
to
the
movement
of
the
sun
there
was
a
citation
of
various
passages
in
genesis
mixed
with
metaphysics
in
various
proportions
and
this
was
thought
to
give
ample
proofs
from
the
bible

the
earth
could
not

sphere

in
the
sixth
century
this
development
culminated
in
what
was
nothing
less
than
a
complete
and
detailed
system
of
the
universe
claiming
to
be
based
upon
scripture
its
author
being
the
egyptian
monk
cosmas
indicopleustes
egypt
was
a
great
of
theologic
thought
to
various
religions
of
antiquity
and
cosmas
appears
to
have
urged
upon
the
early
church
this
egyptian
idea
of
the
construction
of
the
world
just
as
another
egyptian
ecclesiastic
athanasius
urged
upon
the
church
the
egyptian
idea
of
a
triune
deity
ruling
the
world
according
to
cosmas
the
earth
is
a
parallelogram
flat
and
surrounded
by
four
seas
it
is
four
hundred
days
journey
long
and
two
hundred
broad
at
the
outer
edges
of
these
four
seas
arise
massive
walls
closing
in
the
whole
structure
and
supporting
the
firmament
or
vault
of
the
heavens
whose
edges
are
cemented
to
the
walls
these
walls
inclose
the
earth
and
all
the
heavenly
bodies
the
whole
of
this
structure
was
built
most
carefully
and
as
was
then
thought
most
scripturally
starting
with
the
expression
applied
in
the
ninth
chapter
of
hebrews
to
the
tabernacle
in
the
desert
cosmas
insists
with
other
interpreters
of
his
time
that
it
gives
the
key
to
the
whole
construction
of
the
world
the
universe
is
therefore
made
on
the
plan
of
the
jewish
tabernacle
boxlike
and
oblong
going
into
details
he
quotes
the
sublime
words
of
isaiah
it
is
he
that
sitteth
upon
the
circle
of
the
earth
that
stretcheth
out
the
heavens
like
a
curtain
and
spreadeth
them
out
like
a
tent
to
dwell
in
and
the
passage
in
job
which
speaks
of
the
pillars
of
heaven
he
works
all
this
into
his
system
and
reveals
as
he
thinks
treasures
of
science
this
vast
box
is
divided
into
two
compartments
one
above
the
other
in
the
first
of
these
men
live
and
stars
move
and
it
extends
up
to
the
first
solid
vault
or
firmament
above
which
live
the
angels
a
main
part
of
whose
business
it
is
to
push
and
pull
the
sun
and
planets
to
and
fro
next
he
takes
the
text
let
there
be
a
firmament
in
the
midst
of
the
waters
and
let
it
divide
the
waters
from
the
waters
and
other
texts
from
genesis
to
these
he
adds
the
text
from
the
psalms
praise
him
ye
heaven
of
heavens
and
ye
waters
that
be
above
the
heavens
then
casts
all
and
these
growths
of
thought
into
his
crucible
together
finally
brings
out
the
theory
that
over
this
first
vault
is
a
vast
cistern
containing
the
waters
he
then
takes
the
expression
in
genesis
regarding
the
windows
of
heaven
and
establishes
a
doctrine
regarding
the
regulation
of
the
rain
to
the
effect
that
the
angels
not
only
push
and
pull
the
heavenly
bodies
to
light
the
earth
but
also
open
and
close
the
heavenly
windows
to
water
it
to
understand
the
surface
of
the
earth
cosmas
following
the
methods
of
interpretation
which
origen
and
other
early
fathers
of
the
church
had
established
studies
the
table
of
in
the
jewish
tabernacle
the
surface
of
this
table
proves
to
him
that
the
earth
is
flat
and
its
dimensions
prove
that
the
earth
is
twice
as
long
as
broad
its
four
corners
symbolize
the
four
seasons
the
twelve
loaves
of
bread
the
twelve
months
the
hollow
about
the
table
proves
that
the
ocean
surrounds
the
earth
to
account
for
the
movement
of
the
sun
cosmas
suggests
that
at
the
north
of
the
earth
is
a
great
mountain
and
that
at
night
the
sun
is
carried
behind
this
but
some
of
the
commentators
ventured
to
express
a
doubt
here
they
thought
that
the
sun
was
pushed
into
a
pit
at
night
and
pulled
out
in
the
morning
nothing
can
be
more
touching
in
its
simplicity
than
cosmas
summing
up
of
his
great
argument
he
declares
we
say
therefore
with
isaiah
that
the
heaven
embracing
the
universe
is
a
vault
with
job
that
it
is
joined
to
the
earth
and
with
moses
that
the
length
of
the
earth
is
greater
than
its
breadth
the
treatise
closes
with
rapturous
assertions
that
not
only
moses
and
the
prophets
but
also
angels
and
apostles
agree
to
the
truth
of
his
doctrine
and
that
at
the
last
day
god
will
condemn
all
who
do
not
accept
it
although
this
theory
was
drawn
from
scripture
it
was
also
as
we
have
seen
the
result
of
an
evolution
of
theological
thought
begun
long
before
the
scriptural
texts
on
which
it
rested
were
written
it
was
not
at
all
strange
that
cosmas
egyptian
as
he
was
should
have
received
this
old
doctrine
as
we
see
it
indicated
in
the
structure
of
egyptian
temples
and
that
he
should
have
developed
it
by
the
aid
of
the
jewish
scriptures
but
the
theological
world
knew
nothing
of
this
more
remote
evolution
from
pagan
germs
it
was
received
as
virtually
inspired
and
was
soon
regarded
as
a
fortress
of
scriptural
truth
some
of
the
foremost
men
in
the
church
devoted
themselves
to
buttressing
it
with
new
texts
and
throwing
about
it
new
outworks
of
theological
reasoning
the
great
body
of
the
faithful
considered
it
a
direct
gift
from
the
almighty
even
in
the
later
centuries
of

john

largely
from
this
geographical
germ
nor
did
this
evolution
end
here
naturally
in
this
view
of
things
if
heaven
was
a
loft
hell
was
a
cellar
and
if
there
were
ascensions
into
one
there
were
descents
into
the
other
hell
being
so
near
interferences
by
its
occupants
with
the
dwellers
of
the
earth
just
above
were
constant
and
form
a
vast
chapter
in
medieval
literature
dante
made
this
conception
of
the
location
of
hell
still
more
vivid
and
we
find
some
forms
of
it
serious
barriers
to
geographical
investigation
many
a
bold
navigator
who
was
quite
ready
to
brave
pirates
and
tempests
trembled
at
the
thought
of
tumbling
with
his
ship
into
one
of
the
openings
into
hell
which
a
widespread
belief
placed
in
the
atlantic
at
some
unknown
distance
from
europe
this
terror
among
sailors
was
one
of
the
main
obstacles
in
the
great
voyage
of
columbus
in
a
medieval
giving
science
the
form
of
a
dialogue
occur
the
following
question
and
answer
why
is
the
sun
so
red
in
the
evening
because
he
looketh
down
upon
hell
but
the
ancient
germ
of
scientific
truth
in
geography
the
idea
of
the
earth
sphericity
still
lived
although
the
great
majority
of
the
early
fathers
of
the
church
and
especially
lactantius
had
sought
to
crush
it
beneath
the
utterances
attributed
to
isaiah
david
and
paul
the
better
opinion
of
eudoxus
and
aristotle
could
not
be
forgotten
clement
of
alexandria
and
origen
had
even
supported
it
ambrose
and
augustine
had
tolerated
it
and
after
cosmas
had
held
sway
a
hundred
years
it
received
new
life
from
a
great
churchman
of
southern
europe
isidore
of
seville
who
however
fettered
by
the
dominant
theology
in
many
other
things
braved
it
in
this
in
the
eighth
century
a
similar
declaration
was
made
in
the
north
of
europe
by
another
great
church
authority
bede
against
the
new
life
thus
given
to
the
old
truth
the
sacred
theory
struggled
long
and
vigorously
but
in
vain
eminent
authorities
in
later
ages
like
albert
the
great
thomas
aquinas
dante
and
vincent
of
beauvais
felt
obliged
to
accept
the
doctrine
of
the
earth
sphericity
and
as
we
approach
the
modern
period
we
find
its
truth
acknowledged
by
the
vast
majority
of
thinking
men
the
reformation
did
not
at
first
yield
fully
to
this
better
theory
luther
melanchthon
and
calvin
were
very
strict
in
their
adherence
to
the
exact
letter
of
scripture
even
zwingli
broad
as
his
views
generally
were
was
closely
bound
down
in
this
matter
and
held
to
the
opinion
of
the
fathers
that
a
great
firmament
or
floor
separated
the
heavens
from
the
earth
that
above
it
were
the
waters
and
angels
and
below
it
the
earth
and
man
the
main
scope
given
to
independent
thought
on
this
general
subject
among
the
reformers
was
in
a
few
minor
speculations
regarding
the
universe
which
encompassed
eden
the
exact
character
of
the
conversation
of
the
serpent
with
eve
and
the
like
in
the
times
immediately
following
the
reformation
matters
were
even
worse
the
interpretations
of
scripture
by
luther
and
calvin
became
as
sacred
to
their
followers
as
the
scripture
itself
when
calixt
ventured
in
interpreting
the
psalms
to
question
the
accepted
belief
that
the
waters
above
the
heavens
were
contained
in
a
vast
receptacle
upheld
by
a
solid
vault
he
was
bitterly
denounced
as
heretical
in
the
latter
part
of
the
sixteenth
century
musaeus
interpreted
the
accounts
in
genesis
to
mean
that
first
god
made
the
heavens
for
the
roof
or
vault
and
left
it
there
on
high
swinging
until
three
days
later
he
put
the
earth
under
it
but
the
new
scientific
thought
as
to
the
form
had
gained
the
day
the
most
sturdy
believers
were
obliged
to
adjust
their
biblical
theories

speak

accordance
then
with
a
simple
tendency
of
human
thought
that
the
jews
believed
the
centre
of
the
world
to
be
jerusalem
the
book
of
ezekiel
speaks
of
jerusalem
as
in
the
middle
of
the
earth
and
all
other
parts
of
the
world
as
set
around
the
holy
city
throughout
the
ages
of
faith
this
was
very
generally
accepted
as
a
direct
revelation
from
the
almighty
regarding
the
earth
form
jerome
the
greatest
authority
of
the
early
church
upon
the
bible
declared
on
the
strength
of
this
utterance
of
the
prophet
that
jerusalem
could
be
nowhere
but
at
the
earth
centre
in
the
ninth
century
archbishop
rabanus
maurus
reiterated
the
same
argument
in
the
eleventh
century
hugh
of
victor
gave
to
the
doctrine
another
scriptural
demonstration
and
pope
urban
in
his
great
sermon
at
clermont
urging
the
franks
to
the
crusade
declared
jerusalem
is
the
middle
point
of
the
earth
in
the
thirteenth
century
an
ecclesiastical
writer
much
in
vogue
the
monk
caesarius
of
heisterbach
declared
as
the
heart
in
the
midst
of
the
body
so
is
jerusalem
situated
in
the
midst
of
our
inhabited
earth
so
it
was
that
christ
was
crucified
at
the
centre
of
the
earth
dante
accepted
this
view
of
jerusalem
as
a
certainty
wedding
it
to
immortal
verse
and
in
the
pious
book
of
travels
ascribed
to
sir
john
mandeville
so
widely
read
in
the
middle
ages
it
is
declared
that
jerusalem
is
at
the
centre
of
the
world
and
that
a
spear
standing
erect
at
the
holy
sepulchre
casts
no
shadow
at
the
equinox
ezekiel
statement
thus
became
the
standard
of
orthodoxy
to
early
the
map
of
the
world
at
hereford
cathedral
the
maps
of
andrea
bianco
marino
sanuto
and
a
multitude
of
others
fixed
this
view
in
men
minds
and
doubtless
discouraged
during
many
generations
any
scientific
statements
tending
to
unbalance
this
geographical
centre
revealed
in
scripture
for
beliefs
of
various
nations
of
antiquity
that
the

we
have
typical
statements
in

the
stone
in

altar
at
delphi
is
repeatedly
called

nor
did
medieval
thinkers
rest
with
this
conception
in
accordance
with
the
dominant
view
that
physical
truth
must
be
sought
by
theological
reasoning
the
doctrine
was
evolved
that
not
only
the
site
of
the
cross
on
calvary
marked
the
geographical
centre
of
the
world
but
that
on
this
very
spot
had
stood
the
tree
which
bore
the
forbidden
fruit
in
eden
thus
was
geography
made
to
reconcile
all
parts
of
the
great
theologic
plan
this
doctrine
was
hailed
with
joy
by
multitudes
and
we
find
in
the
works
of
medieval
pilgrims
to
palestine
again
and
again
evidence
that
this
had
become
precious
truth
to
them
both
in
theology
and
geography
even
as
late
as
the
eminent
french
priest
eugene
roger
in
his
published
travels
in
palestine
dwelt
upon
the
chapter
of
ezekiel
coupled
with
a
text
from
isaiah
to
prove
that
the
exact
centre
of
the
earth
is
a
spot
marked
on
the
pavement
of
the
church
of
the
holy
sepulchre
and
that
on
this
spot
once
stood
the
tree
which
bore
the
forbidden
fruit
and
the
cross
of
christ
for
the
site
of
the
cross
on
calvary
as
the
point
where
stood
the
tree
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
in
eden
at
the
centre
of
the

edited

the
passage
deserves
to
be
quoted
as
an
example
of
it
is
as
follows
at
the
time
of
our
lord
crucifixion
when
he
gave
up
the
ghost
on
the
cross
the
veil
of
the
temple
was
rent
and
the
rock
above
adam
skull
opened
and
the
blood
and
water
which
flowed
from
christ
side
ran
down
through
the
fissure
upon
the
skull
thus
washing
away
the
sins
of
men
nor
was
this
the
only
misconception
which
forced
its
way
from
our
sacred
writings
into
medieval
two
others
were
almost
as
marked
first
of
these
was
the
vague
terror
inspired
by
gog
and
magog
few
passages
in
the
old
testament
are
more
sublime
than
the
denunciation
of
these
great
enemies
by
ezekiel
and
the
statement
in
the
apocalypse
fastened
the
hebrew
feeling
regarding
them
with
a
new
meaning
into
the
mind
of
the
early
church
hence
it
was
that
the
medieval
took
great
pains
to
delineate
these
monsters
and
their
habitations
on
the
maps
for
centuries
no
map
was
considered
orthodox
which
did
not
show
them
the
second
conception
was
derived
from
the
mention
in
our
sacred
books
of
the
four
winds
hence
came
a
vivid
belief
in
their
real
existence
and
their
delineation
on
the
maps
generally
as
colossal
heads
with
distended
cheeks
blowing
vigorously
toward
jerusalem
after
these
conceptions
had
mainly
disappeared
we
find
here
and
there
evidences
of
the
difficulty
men
found
in
giving
up
the
scriptural
idea
of
direct
personal
interference
by
agents
of
heaven
in
the
ordinary
phenomena
of
nature
thus
in
a
noted
map
of
the
sixteenth
century
representing
the
earth
as
a
sphere
there
is
at
each
pole
a
crank
with
an
angel
laboriously
turning
the
earth
by
means
of
it
and
in
another
map
the
hand
of
the
almighty
thrust
forth
from
the
clouds
holds
the
earth
suspended
by
a
rope
and
spins
it
with
his
thumb
and
fingers
even
as
late
as
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
heylin
the
most
authoritative
english
geographer
of
the
time
shows
a
like
tendency
to
mix
science
and
theology
he
warps
each
to
help
the
other
as
follows
water
making
but
one
globe
with
the
earth
is
yet
higher
than
it
this
appears
first
because
it
is
a
body
not
so
heavy
secondly
it
is
observed
by
sailors
that
their
ships
move
faster
to
the
shore
than
from
it
whereof
no
reason
can
be
given
but
the
height
of
the
water
above
the
land
thirdly
to
such
as
stand
on
the
shore
the
sea
seems
to
swell
into
the
form
of
a
round
hill
till
it
puts
a
bound
upon
our
sight
now
that
the
sea
hovering
thus
over
and
above
the
earth
doth
not
overwhelm
it
can
be
ascribed
only
to
his
providence
who
made
the
waters
to
stand
on

heap

the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
even
while
the
doctrine
of
the
sphericity
of
the
earth
was
undecided
another
question
had
been
suggested
which
theologians
finally
came
to
consider
of
far
greater
importance
the
doctrine
of
the
sphericity
of
the
earth
naturally
led
to
thought
regarding
its
inhabitants
and
another
ancient
germ
was
warmed
into
life
the
idea
of
antipodes
of
human
beings
on
the
earth
opposite
sides
in
the
greek
and
roman
world
this
idea
had
found
supporters
and
opponents
cicero
and
pliny
being
among
the
former
and
epicurus
lucretius
and
plutarch
among
the
latter
thus
the
problem
came
into
the
early
church
unsolved
among
the
first
churchmen
to
take
it
up
was
in
the
east
gregory
nazianzen
who
showed
that
to
sail
beyond
gibraltar
was
impossible
and
in
the
west
lactantius
who
asked
is
there
any
one
so
senseless
as
to
believe
that
there
are
men
whose
footsteps
are
higher
than
their
heads
that
the
crops
and
trees
grow
downward
that
the
rains
and
snow
and
hail
fall
upward
toward
the
earth
i
am
at
a
loss
what
to
say
of
those
who
when
they
have
once
erred
steadily
persevere
in
their
folly
and
defend
one
vain
thing
by
another
in
all
this
contention
by
gregory
and
lactantius
there
was
nothing
to
be
especially
regretted
for
whatever
their
motive
they
simply
supported
their
inherited
belief
on
grounds
of
natural
law
and
probability
unfortunately
the
discussion
was
not
long
allowed
to
rest
on
these
scientific
and
philosophical
grounds
other
christian
thinkers
followed
who
in
their
ardour
adduced
texts
of
scripture
and
soon
the
question
had
become
theological
hostility
to
the
belief
in
antipodes
became
dogmatic
the
universal
church
was
arrayed
against
it
and
in
front
of
the
vast
phalanx
stood
to
a
man
the
fathers
to
all
of
them
this
idea
seemed
dangerous
to
most
of
them
it
seemed
damnable
st
basil
and
ambrose
were
tolerant
enough
to
allow
that
a
man
might
be
saved
who
thought
the
earth
inhabited
on
its
opposite
sides
but
the
great
majority
of
the
fathers
doubted
the
possibility
of
salvation
to
such
misbelievers
the
great
champion
of
the
orthodox
view
was
augustine
though
he
seemed
inclined
to
yield
a
little
in
regard
to
the
sphericity
of
the
earth
he
fought
the
idea
that
men
exist
on
the
other
side
of
it
saying
that
scripture
speaks
of
no
such
descendants
of
adam
he
insists
that
men
could
not
be
allowed
by
the
almighty
to
live
there
since
if
they
did
they
could
not
see
christ
at
his
second
coming
descending
through
the
air
but
his
most
cogent
appeal
one
which
we
find
echoed
from
theologian
to
theologian
during
a
thousand
years
afterward
is
to
the
nineteenth
psalm
and
to
its
confirmation
in
the
epistle
to
the
romans
to
the
words
their
line
is
gone
out
through
all
the
earth
and
their
words
to
the
end
of
the
world
he
dwells
with
great
force
on
the
fact
that
paul
based
one
of
his
most
powerful
arguments
upon
this
declaration
regarding
the
preachers
of
the
gospel
and
that
he
declared
even
more
explicitly
that
verily
their
sound
went
into
all
the
earth
and
their
words
unto
the
ends
of
the
world
thenceforth
we
find
it
constantly
declared
that
as
those
preachers
did
not
go
to
the
antipodes
no
antipodes
can
exist
and
hence
that
the
supporters
of
this
geographical
doctrine
give
the
lie
direct
to
king
david
and
to
paul
and
therefore
to
the
holy
ghost
thus
the
great
bishop
of
hippo
taught
the
whole
world
for
over
a
thousand
years
that
as
there
was
no
preaching
of
the
gospel
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
earth
there
could
be
no
human
beings
there
the
great
authority
of
augustine
and
the
cogency
of
his
scriptural
argument
held
the
church
firmly
against
the
doctrine
of
the
antipodes
all
schools
of
interpretation
were
now
agreed
the
followers
of
the
allegorical
tendencies
of
alexandria
the
strictly
literal
exegetes
of
syria
the
more
eclectic
theologians
of
the
west
for
over
a
thousand
years
it
was
held
in
the
church
always
everywhere
and
by
all
that
there
could
not
be
human
beings
on
the
opposite
sides
of
the
earth
even
if
the
earth
had
opposite
sides
and
when
attacked
by
gainsayers
the
great
mass
of
true
believers
from
the
fourth
century
to
the
fifteenth
simply
used
that
opiate
which
had
so
soothing
an
effect
on
john
henry
newman
in
the
nineteenth
century
securus
judicat
orbis
terrarum
yet
gainsayers
still
appeared
that
the
doctrine
of
the
antipodes
continued
to
have
life
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
in
the
sixth
century
procopius
of
gaza
attacks
it
with
a
tremendous
argument
he
declares
that
if
there
be
men
on
the
other
side
of
the
earth
christ
must
have
gone
there
and
suffered
a
second
time
to
save
them
and
therefore
that
there
must
have
been
there

necessary
preliminaries

coming

the
doctrine
with

bitterness

are
theologically
impossible
at
the
end
of
the
sixth
century
came
a
man
from
whom
much
might
be
expected
isidore
of
seville
he
had
pondered
over
ancient
thought
in
science
and
as
we
have
seen
had
dared
proclaim
his
belief
in
the
sphericity
of
the
earth
but
with
that
he
stopped
as
to
the
antipodes
the
authority
of
the
psalmist
paul
and
augustine
silences
him
he
shuns
the
whole
question
as
unlawful
subjects
reason
to
faith
and
declares
that
men
can
not
and
ought
not
to
exist
on
opposite
sides
of
the

seems

by

eighth
century
the

of

had
come
to
be
generally
accepted
among
the
leaders
of
thought
and
now
the
doctrine
of
the
antipodes
was
again

his
genius
for

work
made
him

his

willingly
to

there
sat
too
at
that
time
on
the
papal
throne
a
great
christian
statesman
pope
zachary
boniface
immediately
declared
against
the
revival
of
such
a
heresy
as
the
doctrine
of
the
antipodes
he
stigmatized
it
as
an
assertion
that
there
are
men
beyond
the
reach
of
the
appointed
means
of
salvation
he
attacked
virgil
and
called
on
pope
zachary
for
aid
the
pope
as
the
infallible
teacher
of

made
a
strong
response
he
cited
passages
from
the
book

and
the
wisdom
of
solomon
against
the
doctrine
of
the
antipodes
he
declared
it
perverse
iniquitous
and
against

own
soul
and
indicated
a
purpose
of
driving
him
from
his
bishopric
whether
this
purpose
was
carried
out
or
not
the
old
theological
view

of

ordered
and
protected
inerrancy
was
and
the
doctrine
that
the
earth
has
inhabitants

us
one
of
the
most
striking
examples
in
history
of
a
great
man
in
theological
fetters
as
he
approaches
this
question
he
states
it
with
such
clearness
that
we
expect
to
hear
him
assert
the
truth
but
there
stands
the
argument
of
augustine
there
too
stand
the
biblical
texts
on
which
it
is
founded
the
text
from
the
psalms
and
the
explicit
declaration
of

to
the
romans

sound
went
into
all
the

and
their

unto
the
ends
of
the
world
attempts
to
reason
but
he
is
overawed
and
gives
to
the
world
virtually
nothing
still
the
doctrine
of
the
antipodes
lived
and
moved
so
much
so
that
the
eminent
spanish
theologian
tostatus
even
as
late
as
the
age
of
columbus
felt
called
upon
to
protest
against
it
as
unsafe
he
had
shaped
the
old
missile
of
augustine
into
the
following
syllogism
the
apostles
were
commanded
to
go
into
all
the
world
and
to
preach
the
gospel
to
every
creature
they
did
not
go
to
any
such
part
of
the
world
as
the
antipodes
they
did
not
preach
to
any
creatures
there
ergo
no
antipodes
exist
the
warfare
of
columbus
the
world
knows
well
how
the
bishop
of
ceuta
worsted
him
in
portugal
how
sundry
wise
men
of
spain
confronted
him
with
the
usual
quotations
from
the
psalms
from
paul
and
from
augustine
how
even
after
he
was
triumphant
and
after
his
voyage
had
greatly
strengthened
the
theory
of
the
earth
sphericity
with
which
the
theory
of
the
antipodes
was
so
closely
connected
the
church
by
its
highest
authority
solemnly
stumbled
and
persisted
in
going
astray
in
pope
alexander
vi
having
been
appealed
to
as
an
umpire
between
the
claims
of
spain
and
portugal
to
the
newly
discovered
parts
of
the
earth
issued
a
bull
laying
down
upon
the
earth
surface
a
line
of
demarcation
between
the
two
powers
this
line
was
drawn
from
north
to
south
a
hundred
leagues
west
of
the
azores
and
the
pope
in
the
plenitude
of
his
knowledge
declared
that
all
lands
discovered
east
of
this
line
should
belong
to
the
portuguese
and
all
west
of
it
should
belong
to
the
spaniards
this
was
hailed
as
an
exercise
of
divinely
illuminated
power
by
the
church
but
difficulties
arose
and
in
another
attempt
was
made
by
pope
julius
ii
to
draw
the
line
three
hundred
and
seventy
leagues
west
of
the
cape
verde
islands
this
again
was
supposed
to
bring
divine
wisdom
to
settle
the
question
but
shortly
overwhelming
difficulties
arose
for
the
portuguese
claimed
brazil
and
of
course
had
no
difficulty
in
showing
that
they
could
reach
it
by
sailing
to
the
east
of
the
line
provided
they
sailed
long
enough
the
lines
laid
down
by
popes
alexander
and
julius
may
still
be
found
upon
the
maps
of
the
period
but
their
bulls
have
quietly
passed
into
the
catalogue
of
ludicrous
errors
yet
the
theological
barriers
to
this
geographical
truth
yielded
but
slowly
plain
as
it
had
become
to
scholars
they
hesitated
to
declare
it
to
the
world
at
large
eleven
hundred
years
had
passed
since
augustine
had
proved
its
antagonism
to
scripture
when
gregory
reysch
gave
forth
his
famous
encyclopaedia
the
margarita
philosophica
edition
after
edition
was
issued
and
everywhere
appeared
in
it
the
orthodox
statements
but
they
were
evidently
strained
to
the
breaking
point
for
while
in
treating
of
the
antipodes
reysch
refers
respectfully
to
augustine
as
objecting
to
the
scientific
doctrine
he
is
careful
not
to
cite
scripture
against
it
and
not
less
careful
to
suggest
geographical
reasoning
in
favour
of
it
but
in
science
gains
a
crushing
victory
magellan
makes
his
famous
voyage
he
proves
the
earth
to
be
round
for
his
expedition
circumnavigates
it
he
proves
the
doctrine
of
the
antipodes
for
his
shipmates
see
the
peoples
of
the
antipodes
yet
even
this
does
not
end
the
war
many
conscientious
men
oppose
the
doctrine
for
two
hundred
years
longer
then
the
french
astronomers
make
their
measurements
of
degrees
in
equatorial
and
polar
regions
and
add
to
their
proofs
that
of
the
lengthened
pendulum
when
this
was
done
when
the
deductions
of
science
were
seen
to
be
established
by
the
simple
test
of
measurement
beautifully
and
perfectly
and
when
a
long
line
of
trustworthy
explorers
including
devoted
missionaries
had
sent
home
accounts
of
the
antipodes
then
and
then
only
this
war
of
twelve
centuries
ended
such
was
the
main
result
of
this
long
war
but
there
were
other
results
not
so
fortunate
the
efforts
of
eusebius
basil
and
lactantius
to
deaden
scientific
thought
the
efforts
of
augustine
to
combat
it
the
efforts
of
cosmas
to
crush
it
by
dogmatism
the
efforts
of
boniface
and
zachary
to
crush
it
by
force
conscientious
as
they
all
were
had
resulted
simply
in
impressing
upon
many
leading
minds
the
conviction
that
science
and
religion
are
enemies
on
the
other
hand
what
was
gained
by
the
warriors
of
science
for
religion
certainly
a
far
more
worthy
conception
of
the
world
and
a
far
more
ennobling
conception
of
that
power
which
pervades
and
directs
it
which
is
more
consistent
with

the

various
ancient
investigators
had
by
different
methods
reached
measurements
more
or
less

these
methods
were

results
were

obtained

they

as

charge
of
sorcery
far
more
consonant
with
the
theological
spirit
of
the
middle
ages
was
a
solution
of
the
problem
from
scripture
and
this
solution
deserves
to
be
given
as
an
example
of
a
very
curious
theological
error
chancing
to
result
in
the
establishment
of
a
great
truth
the
second
book
of
esdras
which
among
protestants
is
placed
in
the
apocrypha
was
held
by
many
of
the
foremost
men
of
the
ancient
church
as
fully
inspired
though
jerome
looked
with
suspicion
on
this
book
it
was
regarded
as
prophetic
by
clement
of
alexandria
tertullian
and
ambrose
and
the
church
acquiesced
in
that
view
in
the
eastern
church
it
held
an
especially
high
place
and
in
the
western
church
before
the
reformation
was
generally
considered
by
the
most
eminent
authorities
to
be
part
of
the
sacred
canon
in
the
sixth
chapter
of
this
book
there
is
a
summary
of
the
works
of
creation
and
in
it
occur
the
following
verses
upon
the
third
day
thou
didst
command
that
the
waters
should
be
gathered
in
the
seventh
part
of
the
earth
six
parts
hast
thou
dried
up
and
kept
them
to
the
intent
that
of
these
some
being
planted
of
god
and
tilled
might
serve
thee
upon
the
fifth
day
thou
saidst
unto
the
seventh
part
where
the
waters
were
gathered
that
it
should
bring
forth
living
creatures
fowls
and
fishes
and
so
it
came
to
pass
these
statements
were
reiterated
in
other
verses
and
were
naturally
considered
as
of
controlling
authority
among
the
scholars
who
pondered
on
this
as
on
all
things
likely
to
increase
knowledge
was
cardinal
pierre
as
we
have
seen
this
great
man
while
he
denied
the
existence
of
the
antipodes
as
augustine
had
done
believed
firmly
in
the
sphericity
of
the
earth
and
interpreting
these
statements
of
the
book
of
esdras
in
connection
with
this
belief
he
held
that
as
only
one
seventh
of
the
earth
surface
was
covered
by
water
the
ocean
between
the
west
coast
of
europe
and
the
east
coast
of
asia
could
not
be
very
wide
knowing
as
he
thought
the
extent
of
the
land
upon
the
globe
he
felt
that
in
view
of
this
divinely
authorized
statement
the
globe
must
be
much
smaller
and
the
land
of
zipango
reached
by
marco
polo
on
the
extreme
east
coast
of
asia
much
nearer
than
had
been
generally
believed
on
this
point
he
laid
stress
in
his
great
work
the
ymago
mundi
and
an
edition
of
it
having
been
published
in
the
days
when
columbus
was
thinking
most
closely
upon
the
problem
of
a
westward
voyage
it
naturally
exercised
much
influence
upon
his
reasonings
among
the
treasures
of
the
library
at
seville
there
is
nothing
more
interesting
than
a
copy
of
this
work
annotated
by
columbus
himself
from
this
very
copy
it
was
that
columbus
obtained
confirmation
of
his
belief
that
the
passage
across
the
ocean
to
marco
polo
land
of
zipango
in
asia
was
short
but
for
this
error
based
upon
a
text
supposed
to
be
inspired
it
is
unlikely
that
columbus
could
have
secured
the
necessary
support
for
his
voyage
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
this
single
theological
error
thus
promoted
a
series
of
voyages
which
completely
destroyed
not
only
this
but
every
other
conception
of
geography

the
sacred
writings

this
error

in

michael

was
on

for
his
life
at
geneva
on
the
charge
of
arianism
servetus
had
rendered
many
services
to
scientific
truth
and
one
of
these
was
an
edition
of
geography
in
which
judea
was
spoken
of
not
as
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
but
in
strict
accordance
with
the
truth
as
in
the
main
meagre
barren
and
inhospitable
in
his
trial
this
simple
statement
of
geographical
fact
was
used
against
him
by
his
john
calvin
with
fearful
power
in
vain
did
servetus
plead
that
he
had
simply
drawn
the
words
from
a
previous
edition
of
ptolemy
in
vain
did
he
declare
that
this
statement
was
a
simple
geographical
truth
of
which
there
were
ample
proofs
it
was
answered
that
such
language
necessarily
inculpated

grievously
outraged

was
discreetly
retrenched
in
a
reprint
of
the
same
edition
in
summing
up
the
action
of
the
church
upon
geography
we
must
say
then
that
the
dogmas
developed
in
strict
adherence
to
scripture
and
the
conceptions
held
in
the
church
during
many
centuries
always
every
where
and
by
all
were
on
the
whole
steadily
hostile
to
truth
but
it
is
only
just
to
make
a
distinction
here
between
the
religious
and
the
theological
spirit
to
the
religious
spirit
are
largely
due
several
of
the
noblest
among
the
great
voyages
of
discovery
a
deep
longing
to
extend
the
realms
of
christianity
influenced
the
minds
of
prince
john
of
portugal
in
his
great
series
of
efforts
along
the
african
coast
of
vasco
da
gama
in
his
circumnavigation
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
of
magellan
in
his
voyage
around
the
world
and
doubtless
found
a
place
among
the
more
worldly
motives
of
columbus
as
to
the
earlier
mixture
in
the
motives
of
columbus
it
may
be
well
to
compare
with
the
earlier
biographies
the
recent
ones
by
winsor
and
president
adams
thus
in
this
field
from
the
supremacy
accorded
to
theology
we
find
resulting
that
tendency
to
dogmatism
which
has
shown
itself
in
all
ages
the
deadly
foe
not
only
of
scientific
inquiry
but
of
the
higher
religious
spirit
itself
while
from
the
love
of
truth
for

the
inspiration
of

the
old
sacred
theory
of
the
universe
the
next
great
series
of
battles
was
fought
over
the
relations
of
the
visible
heavens
to
the
earth
in
the
early
church
in
view
of
the
doctrine
so
prominent
in
the
new
testament
that
the
earth
was
soon
to
be
destroyed
and
that
there
were
to
be
new
heavens
and
a
new
earth
astronomy
like
other
branches
of
science
was
generally
looked
upon
as
futile
why
study
the
old
heavens
and
the
old
earth
when
they
were
so
soon
to
be
replaced
with
something
infinitely
better
this
feeling
appears
in
augustine
famous
utterance
what
concern
is
it
to
me
whether
the
heavens
as
a
sphere
inclose
the
earth
in
the
middle
of
the
world
or
overhang
it
on
either
side
as
to
the
heavenly
bodies
theologians
looked
on
them
as
at
best
only
objects
of
pious
speculation
regarding
their
nature
the
fathers
of
the
church
were
divided
origen
and
others
with
him
thought
them
living
beings
possessed
of
souls
and
this
belief
was
mainly
based
upon
the
scriptural
vision
of
the
morning
stars
singing
together
and
upon
the
beautiful
appeal
to
the
stars
and
light
in
the
song
of
the
three
children
the
benedicite
which
the
anglican
communion
has
so
wisely
retained
in
its
liturgy
other
fathers
thought
the
stars
of
the
angels
and
that
stars
were
moved
by
angels
the
gnostics
thought
the
stars
spiritual
beings
governed
by
angels
and
appointed
not
to
cause
earthly
events
but
to
indicate
them
as
to
the
heavens
in
general
the
prevailing
view
in
the
church
was
based
upon
the
scriptural
declarations
that
a
solid
vault
a
firmament
was
extended
above
the
earth
and
that
the
heavenly
bodies
were
simply
lights
hung
within
it
this
was
for
a
time
held
very
tenaciously
philastrius
in
his
famous
treatise
on
heresies
pronounced
it
a
heresy
to
deny
that
the
stars
are
brought
out
by
god
from
his
and
hung
in
the
sky
every
evening
any
other
view
he
declared
false
to
the
catholic
faith
this
view
also
survived
in
the
sacred
theory
established
so
firmly
by
cosmas
in
the
sixth
century
having
established
his
plan
of
the
universe
upon
various
texts
in
the
old
and
new
testaments
and
having
made
it
a
vast
oblong
box
covered
by
the
solid
firmament
he
brought
in
additional
texts
from
scripture
to
account
for
the
planetary
movements
and
developed
at
length
the
theory
that
the
sun
and
planets
are
moved
and
the
windows
of
heaven
opened
and
shut
by
angels
appointed
for
that
purpose
how
intensely
real
this
way
of
looking
at
the
universe
was
we
find
in
the
writings
of
isidore
the
greatest
leader
of
orthodox
thought
in
the
seventh
century
he
affirms
that
since
the
fall
of
man
and
on
account
of
it
the
sun
and
moon
shine
with
a
feebler
light
but
he
proves
from
a
text
in
isaiah
that
when
the
world
shall
be
fully
redeemed
these
great
lights
will
shine
again
in
all
their
early
splendour
but
despite
these
authorities
and
their
theological
finalities
the
evolution
of
scientific
thought
continued
its
main
germ
being
the
geocentric
doctrine
the
doctrine
that
the
earth
is
the
centre
and
that
the
sun
and
planets
revolve
about
it

mainly
out
of
fragments
of

and

theories
preserved
in
the
hebrew
scriptures
a
new
sacred
system
of
astronomy
which
became
one
of
the
great
treasures
of
the
universal
church
the
last
word
of
revelation
three
great
men
mainly
reared
this
structure
first
was
the
unknown
who
gave
to
the
world
the
treatises
ascribed
to
dionysius
the
areopagite
it
was
unhesitatingly
believed
that
these
were
the
work
of
athenian
convert
and
therefore
virtually
of
paul
himself
though
now
known
to
be
spurious
they
were
then
considered
a
treasure
of
inspiration
and
an
emperor
of
the
east
sent
them
to
an
emperor
of
the
west
as
the
most
worthy
of
gifts
in
the
ninth
century
they
were
widely
circulated
in
western
europe
and
became
a
fruitful
source
of
thought
especially
on
the
whole
celestial
hierarchy
thus
the
old
ideas
of
astronomy
were
vastly
developed
and
the
heavenly
hosts
were
classed
and
named
in
accordance
with
indications
scattered
through
the
sacred
scriptures
the
next
of
these
three
great
theologians
was
peter
lombard
professor
at
the
university
of
paris
about
the
middle
of
the
twelfth
century
he
gave
forth
his
collection
of
sentences
or
statements
by
the
fathers
and
this
remained
until
the
end
of
the
middle
ages
the
universal
manual
of
theology
in
it
was
especially
developed
the
theological
view
of
man
relation
to
the
universe
the
author
tells
the
world
just
as
man
is
made
for
the
sake
of
god
that
is
that
he
may
serve
him
so
the
universe
is
made
for
the
sake
of
man
that
is
that
it
may
serve
him
therefore
is
man
placed
at
the
middle
point
of
the
universe
that
he
may
both
serve
and
be
served
the
vast
significance
of
this
view
and
its
power
in
resisting
any
real
astronomical
science
we
shall
see
especially
in
the
time
of
galileo
the
great
triad
of
thinkers
culminated
in
thomas
aquinas
the
sainted
theologian
the
glory
of
the
mediaeval
church
the
angelic
doctor
the
most
marvellous
intellect
between
aristotle
and
newton
he
to
whom
it
was
believed
that
an
image
of
the
crucified
had
spoken
words
praising
his
writings
large
of
mind
strong
acute
yet
just
even
more
than
just
to
his
opponents
he
gave
forth
in
the
latter
half
of
the
thirteenth
century
his
cyclopaedia
of
theology
the
summa
theologica
in
this
he
carried
the
sacred
theory
of
the
universe
to
its
full
development
with
great
power
and
clearness
he
brought
the
whole
vast
system
material
and
spiritual
into
its
relations
to
god
and
man
for
the
beliefs
of
chaldean
astronomers
in
revolving
spheres
carrying
sun
moon
and
planets
in
a
solid
firmament
supporting
the
celestial
waters
and
in

giving

thus
was
the

by
these

came
the

it

let
us
look
into
this
vast
creation
the
highest
achievement
of
theology
somewhat
more
closely
its
first
feature
shows
a
development
out
of
earlier
theological
ideas
the
earth
is
no
longer
a
flat
plain
inclosed
by
four
walls
and
solidly
vaulted
above
as
theologians
of
previous
centuries
had
believed
it
under
the
inspiration
of
cosmas
it
is
no
longer
a
mere
flat
disk
with
sun
moon
and
stars
hung
up
to
give
it
light
as
the
earlier
cathedral
sculptors
had
figured
it
it
has
become
a
globe
at
the
centre
of
the
universe
encompassing
it
are
successive
transparent
spheres
rotated
by
angels
about
the
earth
and
each
carrying
one
or
more
of
the
heavenly
bodies
with
it
that
nearest
the
earth
carrying
the
moon
the
next
mercury
the
next
venus
the
next
the
sun
the
next
three
mars
jupiter
and
saturn
the
eighth
carrying
the
fixed
stars
the
ninth
was
the
primum
mobile
and
inclosing
all
was
the
tenth
heaven
the
empyrean
this
was
immovable
the
boundary
between
creation
and
the
great
outer
void
and
here
in
a
light
which
no
one
can
enter
the
triune
god
sat
enthroned
the
music
of
the
spheres
rising
to
him
as
they
moved
thus
was
the
old
heathen
doctrine
of
the
spheres
made
christian
in
attendance
upon
the
divine
majesty
thus
enthroned
are
vast
hosts
of
angels
who
are
divided
into
three
hierarchies
one
serving
in
the
empyrean
one
in
the
heavens
between
the
empyrean
and
the
earth
and
one
on
the
earth
each
of
these
hierarchies
is
divided
into
three
choirs
or
orders
the
first
into
the
orders
of
seraphim
cherubim
and
thrones
and
the
main
occupation
of
these
is
to
chant
incessantly
to
continually
cry
the
divine
praises
the
order
of
thrones
conveys
god
will
to
the
second
hierarchy
which
serves
in
the
movable
heavens
this
second
hierarchy
is
also
made
up
of
three
orders
the
first
of
these
the
order
of
dominions
receives
the
divine
commands
the
second
the
order
of
powers
moves
the
heavens
sun
moon
planets
and
stars
opens
and
shuts
the
windows
of
heaven
and
brings
to
pass
all
other
celestial
phenomena
the
third
the
order
of
empire
guards
the
others
the
third
and
lowest
hierarchy
is
also
made
up
of
three
orders
first
of
these
are
the
principalities
the
guardian
spirits
of
nations
and
kingdoms
next
come
archangels
these
protect
religion
and
bear
the
prayers
of
the
saints
to
the
foot
of
god
throne
finally
come
angels
these
care
for
earthly
affairs
in
general
one
being
appointed
to
each
mortal
and
others
taking
charge
of
the
qualities
of
plants
metals
stones
and
the
like
throughout
the
whole
system
from
the
great
triune
god
to
the
lowest
group
of
angels
we
see
at
work
the
mystic
power
attached
to
the
triangle
and
sacred
number
three
the
same
which
gave
the
triune
idea
to
ancient
hindu
theology
which
developed
the
triune
deities
in
egypt
and
which
transmitted
this
theological
gift
to
the
christian
world
especially
through
the
egyptian
athanasius
below
the
earth
is
hell
this
is
tenanted
by
the
angels
who
rebelled
under
the
lead
of
lucifer
prince
of
the
seraphim
the
former
favourite
of
the
trinity
but
of
these
rebellious
angels
some
still
rove
among
the
planetary
spheres
and
give
trouble
to
the
good
angels
others
pervade
the
atmosphere
about
the
earth
carrying
lightning
storm
drought
and
hail
others
infest
earthly
society
tempting
men
to
sin
but
peter
lombard
and
thomas
aquinas
take
pains
to
show
that
the
work
of
these
devils
is
after
all
but
to
discipline
man
or
to
mete
out
deserved
punishment
all
this
vast
scheme
had
been
so
riveted
into
the
ptolemaic
view
by
the
use
of
biblical
texts
and
theological
reasonings
that
the
resultant
system
of
the
universe
was
considered
impregnable
and
final
to
attack
it
was
blasphemy
it
stood
for
centuries
great
theological
men
of
science
like
vincent
of
beauvais
and
cardinal
devoted
themselves
to
showing
not
only
that
it
was
supported
by
scripture
but
that
it
supported
scripture
thus
was
the
geocentric
theory
embedded
in
the
beliefs
and
aspirations
in
the
hopes
and
fears
of
christendom
down
to
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth

and
the
present
writer
once
heard
a

cairo
from
an
eminent
scotch
doctor
of
medicine
to
account
for
the
ancient
hindu
and
egyptian
sacred
threes
and
trinities
the
theory
was
that
when
jehovah
came
down
into
the
garden
of
eden
and
walked
with
adam
in
the
cool
of
the
day
he
explained
his
triune
character
to
adam
and
that
from
adam
it
was
spread
abroad
to
the
various
ancient
nations
ii
the
heliocentric
theory
but
on
the
other
hand
there
had
been
planted
long
before
the
germs
of
a
heliocentric
theory
in
the
sixth
century
before
our
era
pythagoras
and
after
him
philolaus
had
suggested
the
movement
of
the
earth
and
planets
about
a
central
fire
and
three
centuries
later
aristarchus
had
restated
the
main
truth
with
striking
precision
here
comes
in
a
proof
that
the
antagonism
between
theological
and
scientific
methods
is
not
confined
to
christianity
for
this
statement
brought
upon
aristarchus
the
charge
of
blasphemy
and
drew
after
it
a
cloud
of
prejudice
which
hid
the
truth
for
six
hundred
years
not
until
the
fifth
century
of
our
era
did
it
timidly
appear
in
the
thoughts
of
martianus
capella
then
it
was
again
lost
to
sight
for
a
thousand
years
until
in
the
fifteenth
century
distorted
and
imperfect
it
appeared
in
the
writings
of
cardinal
nicholas
de
cusa
but
in
the
shade
cast
by
the
vast
system
which
had
grown
from
the
minds
of
the
great
theologians
and
from
the
heart
of
the
great
poet
there
had
come
to
this
truth
neither
bloom
nor
fruitage
quietly
however
the
soil
was
receiving
enrichment
and
the
air
warmth
the
processes
of
mathematics
were
constantly
improved
the
heavenly
bodies
were
steadily
observed
and
at
length
appeared
far
from
the
centres
of
thought
on
the
borders
of
poland
a
plain
scholar
who
first
fairly
uttered
to
the
modern
world
the
truth
now
so
commonplace
then
so
astounding
that
the
sun
and
planets
do
not
revolve
about
the
earth
but
that
the
earth
and
planets
revolve
about
the
sun
this
man
was
nicholas
copernicus
copernicus
had
been
a
professor
at
rome
and
even
as
early
as
had
announced
his
doctrine
there
but
more
in
the
way
of
a
scientific
curiosity
or
paradox
as
it
had
been
previously
held
by
cardinal
de
cusa
than
as
the
statement
of
a
system
representing
a
great
fact
in
nature
about
thirty
years
later
one
of
his
disciples
widmanstadt
had
explained
it
to
clement
vii
but
it
still
remained
a
mere
hypothesis
and
soon
like
so
many
others
disappeared
from
the
public
view
but
to
copernicus
steadily
studying
the
subject
it
became
more
and
more
a
reality
and
as
this
truth
grew
within
him
he
seemed
to
feel
that
at
rome
he
was
no
longer
safe
to
announce
his
discovery
there
as
a
theory
or
a
paradox
might
amuse
the
papal
court
but
to
announce
it
as
a
truth
as
the
truth
was
a
far
different
matter
he
therefore
returned
to
his
little
town
in
poland
to
publish
his
thought
as
it
had
now
developed
was
evidently
dangerous
even
there
and
for
more
than
thirty
years
it
lay
slumbering
in
the
mind
of
copernicus
and
of
the
friends
to
whom
he
had
privately
intrusted
it
at
last
he
prepared
his
great
work
on
the
revolutions
of
the
heavenly
bodies
and
dedicated
it
to
the
pope
himself
he
next
sought
a
place
of
publication
he
dared
not
send
it
to
rome
for
there
were
the
rulers
of
the
older
church
ready
to
seize
it
he
dared
not
send
it
to
wittenberg
for
there
were
the
leaders
of
protestantism
no
less
hostile
he
therefore
intrusted
it
to
osiander

nuremberg

the
germs
of
heliocentric
theory

as

at

the
catholic

for

cites
a
speech
of
the
archbishop
of
mechlin
before
the
university
of
louvain
to
the
effect
that
copernicus
defended
his
theory
at
rome
in
before
two
thousand
scholars
also
that
another
professor
taught
the
system
in
and
was
made
apostolic
notary
by
clement
viii
all
this
even
if
the
doctrines
taught
were
identical
with
copernicus
as
finally
developed
which
is
simply
not
the
case
avails
nothing
against
the
overwhelming
testimony
that
copernicus
felt
himself
in
danger
testimony
which
the
of
the
copernican
theory
renders
invincible
the
very
title
of
fromundus
book
already
cited
published
within
a
few
miles
of
the
archbishop
own
cathedral
and
sanctioned
expressly
by
the
theological
faculty
of
that
same
university
of
louvain
in
utterly
refutes
the
archbishop
idea
that
the
church
was
inclined
to
treat
copernicus
kindly
the
title
is
as
follows

but
osiander
courage
failed
him
he
dared
not
launch
the
new
thought
boldly
he
wrote
a
grovelling
preface
endeavouring
to
excuse
copernicus
for
his
novel
idea
and
in
this
he
inserted
the
apologetic
lie
that
copernicus
had
propounded
the
doctrine
of
the
earth
movement
not
as
a
fact
but
as
a
hypothesis
he
declared
that
it
was
lawful
for
an
astronomer
to
indulge
his
imagination
and
that
this
was
what
copernicus
had
done
thus
was
the
greatest
and
most
ennobling
perhaps
of
scientific
truths
a
truth
not
less
ennobling
to
religion
than
to
science

of

it
was
put
into

hands
but
he
was
on
his
deathbed
a
few
hours
later
he
was
beyond
the
reach
of
the
conscientious
men
who
would
have
blotted
his
reputation

perhaps
have
destroyed
his
life
yet
not
wholly
beyond

reach
even
death
could
not
be
trusted
to
shield
him
there
seems
to
have
been
fear
of
vengeance
upon

corpse
for
on
his
tombstone
was
placed
no
record
of

no

the
preface
of
osiander
pretending
that
the
book
of
copernicus
suggested
a
hypothesis
instead
of
announcing
a
truth
served
its
purpose
well
during
nearly
seventy
years
the
church
authorities
evidently
thought
it
best
not
to
stir
the
matter
and
in
some
cases
professors
like
calganini
were
allowed
to
present
the
new
view
purely
as
a
hypothesis
there
were
indeed
mutterings
from
time
to
time
on
the
theological
side
but
there
was
no
great
demonstration
against
the
system
until
then
when
the
copernican
doctrine
was
upheld
by
galileo
as
a
truth
and
proved
to
be
a
truth
by
his
telescope
the
book
was
taken
in
hand
by
the
roman
curia
the
statements
of
copernicus
were
condemned
until
they
should
be
corrected
and
the
corrections
required
were
simply
such
as
would
substitute
for
his
conclusions
the
old
ptolemaic
theory
that
this
was
their
purpose
was
seen
in
that
year
when
galileo
was
forbidden
to
teach
or
discuss
the
copernican
theory
and
when
were
forbidden
all
books
which
affirm
the
motion
of
the
earth
henceforth
to
read
the
work
of
copernicus
was
to
risk
damnation
and
the
world
accepted
the
decree
the
strongest
minds
were
thus
held
fast
if
they
could
not
believe
the
old
system
they
must
pretend
that
they
believed
it
and
this
even
after
the
great
circumnavigation
of
the
globe
had
done
so
much
to
open
the
eyes
of
the
world
very
striking
is
the
case
of
the
eminent
jesuit
missionary
joseph
acosta
whose
great
work
on
the
natural
and
moral
history
of
the
indies
published
in
the
last
quarter
of
the
sixteenth
century
exploded
so
many
astronomical
and
geographical
errors
though
at
times
curiously
credulous
he
told
the
truth
as
far
as
he
dared
but
as
to
the
movement
of
the
heavenly
bodies
he
remained
orthodox
declaring
i
have
seen
the
two
poles
whereon
the
heavens
turn

upon
their
axletrees
the
authorities

this
matter
in

of

recent
desperate
attempts
to
fasten
the
responsibility
on

as

seem
ridiculous

simple
fact
that
their
work
was
sanctioned
by
the
highest
church
authority
and
required
to
be
universally

was

one

sweep
away
so
many

so

this
was
peter

he
was
one
of

astronomical
scholars
of

his

brought

of

his

in

and
astronomical

brought
him
the
praise
of
kepler

a
place
in

history
of

never
had
a
true
man
better
opportunity
to
do
a
great
deed
when
copernicus
work
appeared
apian
was
at
the
height
of
his
reputation
and
power
a
quiet
earnest
plea
from
him
even
if
it
had
been
only
for
ordinary
fairness
and
a
suspension
of
judgment
must
have
carried
much
weight
his
devoted
pupil
charles
v
who
sat
on
the
thrones
of
germany
and
spain
must
at
least
have
given
a
hearing
to
such
a
plea
but
unfortunately
apian
was
a
professor
in
an
institution
of
learning
under
the
strictest
church
control
the
university
of
ingolstadt
his
foremost
duty
was
to
teach
safe
science
to
keep
science
within
the
line
of
scriptural
truth
as
interpreted
by
theological
professors
his
great
opportunity
was
lost
apian
continued
to
maunder
over
the
ptolemaic
theory
and
astrology
in
his
the
attack
on
the
copernican
theory
he
neither
supported
nor
opposed
he
was
silent
and
the
cause
of
his
silence
should
never
be
forgotten

doubtless
many
will
exclaim
against
the
roman
catholic
church
for
this
but
the
simple
truth
is
that
protestantism
was
no
less
zealous
against
the
new
scientific
doctrine
all
branches
of
the
protestant
church
lutheran
calvinist
anglican
vied
with
each
other
in
denouncing
the
copernican
doctrine
as
contrary
to
scripture
and
at
a
later
period
the
puritans
showed
the
same
tendency
said
martin
luther
people
gave
ear
to
an
upstart
astrologer
who
strove
to
show
that
the
earth
revolves
not
the
heavens
or
the
firmament
the
sun
and
the
moon
whoever
wishes
to
appear
clever
must
devise
some
new
system
which
of
all
systems
is
of
course
the
very
best
this
fool
wishes
to
reverse
the
entire
science
of
astronomy
but
sacred
scripture
tells
us
that
joshua
commanded
the
sun
to
stand
still
and
not
the
earth
melanchthon
mild
as
he
was
was
not
behind
luther
in
condemning
copernicus
in
his
treatise
on
the
elements
of
physics
published
six
years
after
copernicus
death
he
says
the
eyes
are
witnesses
that
the
heavens
revolve
in
the
space
of
hours
but
certain
men
either
from
the
love
of
novelty
or
to
make
a
display
of
ingenuity
have
concluded
that
the
earth
moves
and
they
maintain
that
neither
the
eighth
sphere
nor
the
sun
revolves
now
it
is
a
want
of
honesty
and
decency
to
assert
such
notions
publicly
and
the
example
is
pernicious
it
is
the
part
of
a
good
mind
to
accept
the
truth
as
revealed
by
god
and
to
acquiesce
in
it
melanchthon
then
cites
the
passages
in
the
psalms
and
ecclesiastes
which
he
declares
assert
positively
and
clearly
that
the
earth
stands
fast
and
that
the
sun
moves
around
it
and
adds
eight
other
proofs
of
his
proposition
that
the
earth
can
be
nowhere
if
not
in
the
centre
of
the
universe
so
earnest
does
this
mildest
of
the
reformers
become
that
he
suggests
severe
measures
to
restrain
such
impious
teachings

those

of

so
important
was
it
thought

in

were

as
to

strange
as

may
seem

were
the

confirming

theory
more
carefully
kept
out

than
at

the
university
of

about
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth

there
were
at

centre
of

instruction
two
astronomers
of
a
very
high
order
rheticus
and
reinhold
both
of
these
after
thorough
study
had
convinced
themselves
that
the
copernican
system
was
true
but
neither
of
them
was
allowed
to
tell
this
truth
to
his
students
neither
in
his
lecture
announcements
nor
in
his
published
works
did
rheticus
venture
to
make
the
new
system
known
and
he
at
last
gave
up
his
professorship
and
left
wittenberg
that
he
might
have
freedom
to
seek
and
tell
the
truth
reinhold
was
even
more
wretchedly
humiliated
convinced
of
the
truth
of
the
new
theory
he
was
obliged
to
advocate
the
old
if
he
mentioned
the
copernican
ideas
he
was
compelled
to
overlay
them
with
the
ptolemaic
even
this
was
not
thought
safe
enough
and
in
the
subject
was
intrusted
to
peucer
he
was
eminently
sound
and
denounced
the
copernican
theory
in
his
lectures
as
absurd
and
unfit
to
be
introduced
into
the
schools
to
clinch
ideas
more
firmly
into
german
protestant
teaching
rector
hensel
wrote
a
for
schools
entitled
the
restored
mosaic
system
of
the
world
which
showed
the
copernican
astronomy
to
be
unscriptural
doubtless
this
has
a
sound
yet
its
echo
comes
very
near
modern
protestantism
in
the
expulsion
of
woodrow
by
the
presbyterian
authorities
in

galileo
the

his

had
clearly
taken
the
copernican
theory
out
of
the
list
of
hypotheses
and
had
placed
it
before
the

as
a
truth
against
him
then

was
long
and
bitter
the
supporters
of

was
called

declared

deceptions
and
his

blasphemy
professors
endeavouring
to
curry

congregations
of

and
at
last
two
popes
dealt
with
him
and
as
was
supposed
silenced
his
impious
doctrine
forever
a
very
curious
example
of
this
sham
science
employed
by
theologians
is
seen
in
the
argument
frequently
used
at
that
time
that

would
fall

so

as

no
careful
summary
of
it
has
been

in

since
the
whole
history
was
placed
in
a
new
light
by
the
revelations
of
the

in

vatican
library
honestly
published
for
the
first
time
by
in
and
since
that
by
gebler
berti
favaro
and
others
the
first
important
attack
on
galileo
began
in
when
he
announced
that
his
telescope
had
revealed
the
moons
of
the
planet
jupiter
the
enemy
saw
that
this
took
the
copernican
theory
out
of
the
realm
of
hypothesis
and
they
gave
battle
immediately
they
denounced
both
his
method
and
its
results
as
absurd
and
impious
as
to
his
method
professors
bred
in
the
safe
science
favoured
by
the
church
argued
that
the
divinely
appointed
way
of
arriving
at
the
truth
in
astronomy
was
by
theological
reasoning
on
texts
of
scripture
and
as
to
his
results
they
insisted
first
that
aristotle
knew
nothing
of
these
new
revelations
and
next
that
the
bible
showed
by
all
applicable
types
that
there
could
be
only
seven
planets
that
this
was
proved
by
the
seven
golden
candlesticks
of
the
apocalypse
by
the
candlestick
of
the
tabernacle
and
by
the
seven
churches
of
asia
that
from
galileo
doctrine
consequences
must
logically
result
destructive
to
christian
truth
bishops
and
priests
therefore
warned
their
flocks
and
multitudes
of
the
faithful
besought
the
inquisition
to
deal
speedily
and
sharply
with
the
heretic
see

the
discovery
of
the

bacon
see
jevons
as

for
argument
drawn
from
the
candlestick
and
the
seven
churches

in
vain
did
galileo
try
to
prove
the
existence
of
satellites
by
showing
them
to
the
doubters
through
his
telescope
they
either
declared
it
impious
to
look
or
if
they
did
look
denounced
the
satellites
as
illusions
from
the
devil
good
father
clavius
declared
that
to
see
satellites
of
jupiter
men
had
to
make
an
instrument
which
would
create
them
in
vain
did
galileo
try
to
save
the
great
truths
he
had
discovered
by
his
letters
to
the
benedictine
castelli
and
the
christine
in
which
he
argued
that
literal
biblical
interpretation
should
not
be
applied
to
science
it
was
answered
that
such
an
argument
only
made
his
heresy
more
detestable
that
he
was
worse
than
luther
or
calvin
the
war
on
the
copernican
theory
which
up
to
that
time
had
been
carried
on
quietly
now
flamed
forth

was
declared
that
the
doctrine
was
proved
false

the

declarations
that

still
swept

another
revelation
was
announced

on
another

it

this

statement
that

contradict

another
struggle
was
aroused
when
the
hated
telescope
revealed
spots
upon

their
motion
indicating
the
sun
rotation
monsignor
elci
head
of
the
university

forbade

castelli
to
mention
these
spots
to
his
students
father
busaeus
at
the
university
of
innspruck
forbade
the
astronomer
scheiner
who
had
also
discovered
the
spots
and
proposed
a
safe
explanation
of
them
to
allow
the
new
discovery
to
be
known
there
at
the
college
of
douay
and
the
university
of

this
discovery
was
expressly
placed
under
the
ban
and
this
became
the
general
rule
among
the
catholic
universities
and
colleges
of
europe
the
spanish
universities
were
especially
intolerant
of
this
and
similar
ideas
and
up
to
a
recent
period
their
presentation
was
strictly
forbidden

nothing
could
be
more
in

forth
by
sundry
ecclesiastics
catholic
and
protestant
that
the
church
alone
is
empowered
to
promulgate

truth
or
direct

instruction
but
science
gained
a
victory
here
also
observations
of
the
solar
spots
were
reported
not
only
from
galileo
in
italy
but
from
fabricius
in
holland
father
scheiner
then
endeavoured
to
make
the
usual
compromise
between
theology
and
science
he
promulgated
a
theory
which
only
provoked
derision
the
war
became
more
and
more
bitter
the
dominican
father
caccini
preached
a
sermon
from
the
text
ye
men
of
galilee
why
stand
ye
gazing
up
into
heaven
and
this
wretched
pun
upon
the
great
astronomer
name
ushered
in
sharper
weapons
for
before
caccini
ended
he
insisted
that
geometry
is
of
the
devil
and
that
mathematicians
should
be
banished
as
the
authors
of
all
heresies
the
church
authorities
gave
caccini
promotion
father
lorini
proved
that
galileo
doctrine
was
not
only
heretical
but
atheistic
and
besought
the
inquisition
to
intervene
the
bishop
of
fiesole
screamed
in
rage
against
the
copernican
system
publicly
insulted
galileo
and
denounced
him
to
the
the
archbishop
of
pisa
secretly
sought
to
entrap
galileo
and
deliver
him
to
the
inquisition
at
rome
the
archbishop
of
florence
solemnly
condemned
the
new
doctrines
as
unscriptural
and
paul
v
while
petting
galileo
and
inviting
him
as
the
greatest
astronomer
of
the
world
to
visit
rome
was
secretly
moving
the
archbishop
of
pisa
to
pick
up
evidence
against
the
astronomer
but
by
far
the
most
terrible
champion
who
now
appeared
was
cardinal
bellarmin
one
of
the
greatest
theologians
the
world
has
known
he
was
earnest
sincere
and
learned
but
insisted
on
making
science
conform
to
scripture
the
weapons
which
men
of
bellarmin
stamp
used
were
purely
theological
they
held
up
before
the
world
the
dreadful
consequences
which
must
result
to
christian
theology
were
the
heavenly
bodies
proved
to
revolve
about
the
sun
and
not
about
the
earth
their
most
tremendous
dogmatic
engine
was
the
statement
that
his
pretended
discovery
vitiates
the
whole
christian
plan
of
salvation
father
lecazre
declared
it
casts
suspicion
on
the
doctrine
of
the
incarnation
others
declared
it
upsets
the
whole
basis
of
theology
if
the
earth
is
a
planet
and
only
one
among
several
planets
it
can
not
be
that
any
such
great
things
have
been
done
specially
for
it
as
the
christian
doctrine
teaches
if
there
are
other
planets
since
god
makes
nothing
in
vain
they
must
be
inhabited
but
how
can
their
inhabitants
be
descended
from
adam
how
can
they
trace
back
their
origin
to
noah
ark
how
can
they
have
been
redeemed
by
the
saviour
nor
was
this
argument
confined
to
the
theologians
of
the
roman
church
melanchthon
protestant
as
he
was
had
already
used
it
in
his
attacks
on
copernicus
and
his
school
in
addition
to
this
prodigious
theological
engine
of
war
there
was
kept
up
a
fire
of
smaller
artillery
in
the
shape
of
texts
and
scriptural
extracts
but
the
war
grew
still
more
bitter
and
some
weapons
used
in
it
are
worth
examining
they
are
very
easily
examined
for
they
are
to
be
found
on
all
the
battlefields
of
science
but
on
that
field
they
were
used
with
more
effect
than
on
almost
any
other
these
weapons
are
the
epithets
infidel
and
atheist
they
have
been
used
against
almost
every
man
who
has
ever
done
anything
new
for
his
the
list
of
those
who
have
been
denounced
as
infidel
and
atheist
includes
almost
all
great
men
of
science
general
scholars
inventors
and
philanthropists
the
purest
christian
life
the
noblest
christian
character
have
not
availed
to
shield
combatants
christians
like
isaac
newton
pascal
locke
milton
and
even
fenelon
and
howard
have
had
this
weapon
hurled
against
them
of
all
proofs
of
the
existence
of
a
god
those
of
descartes
have
been
wrought
most
thoroughly
into
the
minds
of
modern
men
yet
the
protestant
theologians
of
holland
sought
to
bring
him
to
torture
and
to
death
by
the
charge
of
atheism
and
the
roman
catholic
theologians
of
france
thwarted
him
during
his
life
and
prevented
any
due
honours
to
him
after
his
death

various
objectors

these

arrows
they

to

sometimes

are
somewhat
blunted
indeed
they
not

injure
the
assailants
more
than
the
assailed
so
it
was
not

days

were

yet
a
baser
warfare
was
waged
by
the
archbishop
of
pisa
this
man
whose
cathedral
derives
its
most
enduring
fame
from
galileo
deduction
of
a
great
natural
law
from
the
swinging
lamp
before
its
altar
was
not
an
archbishop
after
the
noble
mould
of
borromeo
and
fenelon
and
cheverus
sadly
enough
for
the
church
and
humanity
he
was
simply
a
zealot
and
intriguer
he
perfected
the
plan
for
entrapping
the
great
astronomer
galileo
after
his
discoveries
had
been
denounced
had
written
to
his
friend
castelli
and
to
the
christine
two
letters
to
show
that
his
discoveries
might
be
reconciled
with
scripture
on
a
hint
from
the
inquisition
at
rome
the
archbishop
sought
to
get
hold
of
these
letters
and
exhibit
them
as
proofs
that
galileo
had
uttered
heretical
views
of
theology
and
of
scripture
and
thus
to
bring
him
into
the
clutch
of
the
inquisition
the
archbishop
begs
castelli
therefore
to
let
him
see
the
original
letter
in
the
handwriting
of
galileo
castelli
declines
the
archbishop

while
as
is
now
revealed
writing
constantly
and
bitterly
to
the
inquisition
against
galileo
professes
to

the
greatest
admiration
of
galileo
genius
and
a
sincere
desire
to
know
more
of
his
discoveries
this
not
succeeding
the
archbishop
at
last
throws
off
the
mask
and
resorts
to
open
attack
the
whole
struggle
to
crush
galileo
and
to
save
him
would
be
amusing
were
it
not
so
fraught
with
evil
there
were
intrigues
and
plots
and
lying
and
spying
and
in
the
thickest
of
this
seething
squabbling
screaming
mass
of
priests
bishops
archbishops
and
cardinals
appear
two
popes
paul
v
and
urban
viii
it
is
most
suggestive
to
see
in
this
crisis
of
the
church
at
the
tomb
of
the
prince
of
the
apostles
on
the
eve
of
the
greatest
errors
in
church
policy
the
world
has
known
in
all
the
intrigues
and
deliberations
of
these
consecrated
leaders
of
the
church
no
more
evidence
of
the
guidance
or
presence
of
the
holy
spirit
than
in
a
caucus
of
new
york
politicians
at
tammany
hall
but
the
opposing
powers
were
too
strong
in
galileo
was
summoned
before
the
inquisition
at
rome
and
the
mine
which
had
been
so
long
preparing
was
sprung
sundry
theologians
of
the
inquisition
having
been
ordered
to
examine
two
propositions
which
had
been
extracted
from
galileo
letters
on
the
solar
spots
solemnly
considered
these
points
during
about
a
month
and
rendered
their
unanimous
decision
as
follows
the
first
proposition
that
the
sun
is
the
centre
and
does
not
revolve
about
the
earth
is
foolish
absurd
false
in
theology
and
heretical
because
expressly
contrary
to
holy
scripture
and
the
second
proposition
that
the
earth
is
not
the
centre
but
revolves
about
the
sun
is
absurd
false
in
philosophy
and
from
a
theological
point
of
view
at
least
opposed
to
the
true
faith
the
pope
himself
paul
v
now
intervened
again
he
ordered
that
galileo
be
brought
before
the
inquisition
then
the
greatest
man
of
science
in
that
age
was
brought
face
to
face
with
the
greatest
theologian
galileo
was
confronted
by
bellarmin
bellarmin
shows
galileo
the
error
of
his
opinion
and
orders
him
to
renounce
it
de
lauda
fortified
by
a
letter
from
the
pope
gives
orders
that
the
astronomer
be
placed
in
the
dungeons
of
the
inquisition
should
he
refuse
to
yield
bellarmin
now
commands
galileo
in
the
name
of
his
holiness
the
pope
and
the
whole
congregation
of
the
holy
office
to
relinquish
altogether
the
opinion
that
the
sun
is
the
centre
of
the
world
and
immovable
and
that
the
earth
moves
nor
henceforth
to
hold
teach
or
defend
it
in
any
way
whatsoever
verbally
or
in
writing
this
injunction
galileo
acquiesces
in
and
promises
to
obey
i
am
aware
that
the
theory
proposed
by
wohwill
and
developed
by
gebler
denied
that
this
promise
was
ever
made
by
galileo
and
holds
that
the
passage
was
a
forgery
devised
later
by
the
church
rulers
to
justify
the
proceedings
of
and
this
would
make
the
conduct
of
the
church
worse
but
authorities
as
eminent
consider
the
charge
not
proved
a
careful
examination
of
the
documents
seems
to
disprove
it
this
was
on
the
of
february
about
a
fortnight
later
the
congregation
of
the
index
moved
thereto
as
the
letters
and
documents
now
brought
to
light
show
by
pope
paul
v
solemnly
rendered
a
decree
that
the
doctrine
of
the
double
motion
of
the
earth
about
its
axis
and
about
the
sun
is
false
and
entirely
contrary
to
holy
scripture
and
that
this
opinion
must
neither
be
taught
nor
advocated
the
same
decree
condemned
all
writings
of
copernicus
and
all
writings
which
affirm
the
motion
of
the
earth
the
great
work
of
copernicus
was
interdicted
until
corrected
in
accordance
with
the
views
of
the
inquisition
and
the
works
of
galileo
and
kepler
though
not
mentioned
by
name
at
that
time
were
included
among
those
implicitly
condemned
as
affirming
the
motion
of
the
earth
the
condemnations
were
inscribed
upon
the
index
and
finally
the
papacy
committed
itself
as
an
infallible
judge
and
teacher
to
the
world
by
prefixing
to
the
index
the
usual
papal
bull
giving
its
monitions
the
most
solemn
papal
sanction
to
teach
or
even
read
the
works
denounced
or
passages
condemned
was
to
risk
persecution
in
this
world
and
damnation
in
the
next
science
had
apparently
lost
the
decisive
battle
for
a
time
after
this
judgment
galileo
remained
in
rome
apparently
hoping
to
find
some
way
out
of
this
difficulty
but
he
soon
discovered
the
hollowness
of
the
protestations
made
to
him
by
ecclesiastics
and
being
recalled
to
florence
remained
in
his
hermitage
near
the
city
in
silence
working
steadily
indeed
but
not
publishing
anything
save
by
private
letters
to
friends
in
various
parts
of
europe
but
at
last
a
better
vista
seemed
to
open
for
him
cardinal
barberini
who
had
seemed
liberal
and
friendly
became
pope
under
the
name
of
urban
viii
galileo
at
this
conceived
new
hopes
and
allowed
his
continued
allegiance
to
the
copernican
system
to
be
known
new
troubles
ensued
galileo
was
induced
to
visit
rome
again
and
pope
urban
tried
to
cajole
him
into
silence
personally
taking
the
trouble
to
show
him
his
errors
by
argument
other
opponents
were
less
considerate
for
works
appeared
attacking
his
ideas
works
all
the
more
unmanly
since
their
authors
knew
that
galileo
was
restrained
by
force
from
defending
himself
then
too
as
if
to
accumulate
proofs
of
the
unfitness
of
the
church
to
take
charge
of
advanced
instruction
his
salary
as
a
professor
at
the
university
of
pisa
was
taken
from
him
and
sapping
and
mining
began
just
as
the
archbishop
of
pisa
some
years
before
had
tried
to
betray
him
with
honeyed
words
to
the
inquisition
so
now
father
grassi
tried
it
and
after
various
attempts
to
draw
him
out
by
flattery
suddenly
denounced
his
scientific
ideas
as
leading
to
a
denial
of
the
real
presence
in
the
eucharist
for
the
final
assault
upon
him
a
park
of
heavy
artillery
was
at
last
wheeled
into
place
it
may
be
seen
on
all
the
scientific
battlefields
it
consists
of
general
denunciation
and
in
father
melchior
inchofer
of
the
jesuits
brought
his
artillery
to
bear
upon
galileo
with
this
declaration
the
opinion
of
the
earth
motion
is
of
all
heresies
the
most
abominable
the
most
pernicious
the
most
scandalous
the
immovability
of
the
earth
is
thrice
sacred
argument
against
the
immortality
of
the
soul
the
existence
of
god
and
the
incarnation
should
be
tolerated
sooner
than
an
argument
to
prove
that
the
earth
moves
from
the
other
end
of
europe
came
a
powerful
echo
from
the
shadow
of
the
cathedral
of
antwerp
the
noted
theologian
fromundus
gave
forth
his
famous
treatise
the
its
very
was
a
contemptuous
insult
to
the
memory
of
copernicus
since
it
paraded
the
assumption
that
the
new
truth
was
only
an
exploded
theory
of
a
pagan
astronomer
fromundus
declares
that
sacred
scripture
fights
against
the
copernicans
to
prove
that
the
sun
revolves
about
the
earth
he
cites
the
passage
in
the
psalms
which
speaks
of
the
sun
which
cometh
forth
as
a
bridegroom
out
of
his
chamber
to
prove
that
the
earth
stands
still
he
quotes
a
passage
from
ecclesiastes
the
earth
standeth
fast
forever
to
show
the
utter
futility
of
the
copernican
theory
he
declares
that
if
it
were
true
the
wind
would
constantly
blow
from
the
east
and
that
buildings
and
the
earth
itself
would
fly
off
with
such
a
rapid
motion
that
men
would
have
to
be
provided
with
claws
like
cats
to
enable
them
to
hold
fast
to
the
earth
surface
greatest
weapon
of
all
he
works
up
by
the
use
of
aristotle
and
thomas
aquinas
a
demonstration
from
theology
and
science
combined
that
the
earth
must
stand
in
the
centre
and
that
the
sun
must
revolve
about
it
nor
was
it
merely

opposed
the
truth
revealed
by
copernicus
such
strong

as

and
upon

prepared
a

in
the
form
of
a
dialogue
exhibiting
the
arguments
for
and
against
the
copernican
and

ideas
of
father
ricciardi
master
of
the
sacred

and
signed
by

in
which
the
copernican
theory
was
virtually
exhibited
as
a
play
of
the
imagination
and
not
at
all
as
opposed
to

doctrine
reasserted

under

direction

paul
this

prodigious
success
it
put
new
weapons
into

hands

the
supporters
of
the
copernican
theory
the
pious
preface
was
laughed
at
from
one
end
of
europe
to
the
other
this
roused
the
enemy
the
jesuits
dominicans
and
the
great
majority
of
the
clergy
returned
to
the
attack
more
violent
than
ever
and
in
the
midst
of
them
stood
pope
urban
viii
most
bitter
of
all
his
whole
power
was
now
thrown
against
galileo
he
was
touched
in
two
points
first
in
his
personal
vanity
for
galileo
had
put
the
pope
arguments
into
the
mouth
of
one
of
the
persons
in
the
dialogue
and
their
refutation
into
the
mouth
of
another
but
above
all
he
was
touched
in
his
religious
feelings
again
and
again
his
holiness
insisted
to
all
comers
on
the
absolute
and
specific
declarations
of
holy
scripture
which
prove
that
the
sun
and
heavenly
bodies
revolve
about
the
earth
and
declared
that
to
gainsay
them
is
simply
to
dispute
revelation
certainly
if
one
ecclesiastic
more
than
another
ever
seemed
not
under
the
care
of
the
spirit
of
truth
it
was
urban
viii
in
all
this
matter
herein
was
one
of
the
greatest
pieces
of
ill
fortune
that
has
ever
befallen
the
older
church
had
pope
urban
been
and
tolerant
like
benedict
xiv
or
had
he
been
taught
moderation
by
adversity
like
pius
vii
or
had
he
possessed
the
large
scholarly
qualities
of
leo
xiii
now
reigning
the
vast
scandal
of
the
galileo
case
would
never
have
burdened
the
church
instead
of
devising
endless
quibbles
and
special
pleadings
to
escape
responsibility
for
this
colossal
blunder
its
defenders
could
have
claimed
forever
for
the
church
the
glory
of
fearlessly
initiating
a
great
epoch
in
human
thought
but
it
was
not
so
to
be
urban
was
not
merely
pope
he
was
also
a
prince
of
the
house
of
barberini
and
therefore
doubly
angry
that
his
arguments
had
been
publicly
controverted
the
opening
strategy
of
galileo
enemies
was
to
forbid
the
sale
of
his
work
but
this
was
soon
seen
to
be
unavailing
for
the
first
edition
had
already
been
spread
throughout
europe
urban
now
became
more
angry
than
ever
and
both
galileo
and
his
works
were
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
inquisition
in
vain
did
the
good
benedictine
castelli
urge
that
galileo
was
entirely
respectful
to
the
church
in
vain
did
he
insist
that
nothing
that
can
be
done
can
now
hinder
the
earth
from
revolving
he
was
dismissed
in
disgrace
and
galileo
was
forced
to
appear
in
the
presence
of
the
dread
tribunal
without
defender
or
adviser
there
as
was
so
long
concealed
but
as
is
now
fully
revealed
he
was
menaced
with
torture
again
and
again
by
express
order
of
pope
urban
and
as
is
also
thoroughly
established
from
the
trial
documents
themselves
forced
to
abjure
under
threats
and
subjected
to
imprisonment
by
command
of
the
pope
the
inquisition
deferring
in
this
whole
matter
to
the
papal
authority
all
the
long
series
of
attempts
made
in
the
supposed
interest
of
the
church
to
mystify
these
transactions
have
at
last
failed
the
world
knows
now
that
galileo
was
subjected
certainly
to
indignity
to
imprisonment
and
to
threats
equivalent
to
torture
and
was
at
last
forced
to
pronounce
publicly
and
on
his
knees
his
recantation
as
follows
i
galileo
being
in
my
seventieth
year
being
a
prisoner
and
on
my
knees
and
before
your
eminences
having
before
my
eyes
the
holy
gospel
which
i
touch
with
my
hands
abjure
curse
and
detest
the
error
and
the
heresy
of
the
movement
of
the
earth
for
various
utterances
of
pope
urban
against
the
copernican
theory
at
this
period
see

from
the
original
documents
given
by

punishment
of
those
who
had

is
not
probable
that
torture
in
the
ordinary
sense
was
administered
to
galileo
though
it
was
threatened
see
th
martin
vie
de
galilee
for
a
fair
summing
up
of
the
case
he
was
vanquished
indeed
for
he
had
been
forced
in
the
face
of
all
coming
ages
to
perjure
himself
to
complete
his
dishonour
he
was
obliged
to
swear
that
he
would
denounce
to
the
inquisition
any
other
man
of
science
whom
he
should
discover
to
be
supporting
the
heresy
of
the
motion
of
the
earth
many
have
wondered
at
this
abjuration
and
on
account
of
it
have
denied
to
galileo
the
title
of
martyr
but
let
such
gainsayers
consider
the
circumstances
here
was
an
old
man
one
who
had
reached
the
allotted
threescore
years
and
ten
broken
with
disappointments
worn
out
with
labours
and
cares
dragged
from
florence
to
rome
with
the
threat
from
the
pope
himself
that
if
he
delayed
he
should
be
brought
in
chains
sick
in
body
and
mind
given
over
to
his
oppressors
by
the
who
ought
to
have
protected
him
and
on
his
arrival
in
rome
threatened
with
torture
what
the
inquisition
was
he
knew
well
he
could
remember
as
but
of
yesterday
the
burning
of
giordano
bruno
in
that
same
city
for
scientific
and
philosophic
heresy
he
could
remember
too
that
only
eight
years
before
this
very
time
de
dominis
archbishop
of
spalatro
having
been
seized
by
the
inquisition
for
scientific
and
other
heresies
had
died
in
a
dungeon
and
that
his
body
and
his
writings
had
been
publicly
burned
to
the
end
of
his
life
nay
after
his
life
was
ended
the
persecution
of
galileo
was
continued
he
was
kept
in
exile
from
his
family
from
his
friends
from
his
noble
employments
and
was
held
rigidly
to
his
promise
not
to
speak
of
his
theory
when
in
the
midst
of
intense
bodily
sufferings
from
disease
and
mental
sufferings
from
calamities
in
his
family
he
besought
some
little
liberty
he
was
met
with
threats
of
committal
to
a
dungeon
when
at
last
a
special
commission
had
reported
to
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
that
he
had
become
blind
and
wasted
with
disease
and
sorrow
he
was
allowed
a
little
more
liberty
but
that
little
was
hampered
by
close
surveillance
he
was
forced
to
bear
contemptible
attacks
on
himself
and
on
his
works
in
silence
to
see
the
men
who
had
befriended
him
severely
punished
father
castelli
banished
ricciardi
the
master
of
the
sacred
palace
and
ciampoli
the
papal
secretary
thrown
out
of
their
positions
by
pope
urban
and
the
inquisitor
at
florence
reprimanded
for
having
given
permission
to
print
galileo
work
he
lived
to
see
the
truths
he
had
established
carefully
weeded
out
from
all
the
church
colleges
and
universities
in
europe
and
when
in
a
scientific
work
he
happened
to
be
spoken
of
as
renowned
the
inquisition
ordered
the
substitution
of
the
word
notorious
for
the
substitution
of
the
word
notorious
for
renowned
by
order
of
the
inquisition
see
martin
and
now
measures
were
taken
to
complete
the
destruction
of
the
copernican
theory
with
galileo
proofs
of
it
on
the
of
june
the
holy
congregation
with
the
permission
of
the
reigning
pope
ordered
the
sentence
upon
galileo
and
his
recantation
to
be
sent
to
all
the
papal
nuncios
throughout
europe
as
well
as
to
all
archbishops
bishops
and
inquisitors
in
italy
and
this
document
gave
orders
that
the
sentence
and
abjuration
be
made
known
to
your
vicars
that
you
and
all
professors
of
philosophy
and
mathematics
may
have
knowledge
of
it
that
they
may
know
why
we
proceeded
against
the
said
galileo
and
recognise
the
gravity
of
his
error
in
order
that
they
may
avoid
it
and
thus
not
incur
the
penalties
which
they
would
have
to
suffer
in
case
they
fell
into
the
same
for
a
copy
of
this
document
see
gebler
as
to
the
spread
of
this
and
similar
documents
notifying
europe
of
condemnation
see
favaro
pp
as
a
consequence
the
processors
of
mathematics
and
astronomy
in
various
universities
of
europe
were
assembled
and
these
documents
were
read
to
them
to
the
theological
authorities
this
gave
great
satisfaction
the
rector
of
the
university
of
douay
referring
to
the
opinion
of
galileo
wrote
to
the
papal
nuncio
at
brussels
the
professors
of
our
university
are
so
opposed
to
this
fanatical
opinion
that
they
have
always
held
that
it
must
be
banished
from
the
schools
in
our
english
college
at
douay
this
paradox
has
never
been
approved
and
never
will
be
still
another
step
was
taken
the
inquisitors
were
ordered
especially
in
italy
not
to
permit
the
publication
of
a
new
edition
of
any
of
galileo
works
or
of
any
similar
writings
on
the
other
hand
theologians
were
urged
now
that
copernicus
and
galileo
and
kepler
were
silenced
to
reply
to
them
with
tongue
and
pen
europe
was
flooded
with
these
theological
refutations
of
the
copernican
system
to
make
all
complete
there
was
prefixed
to
the
index
of
the
church
forbidding
all
writings
which
affirm
the
motion
of
the
earth
a
bull
signed
by
the
reigning
pope
which
by
virtue
of
his
infallibility
as
a
divinely
guided
teacher
in
matters
of
faith
and
morals
clinched
this
condemnation
into
the
consciences
of
the
whole
christian
world
from
the
mass
of
books
which
appeared
under
the
auspices
of
the
church
immediately
after
the
condemnation
of
galileo
for
the
purpose
of
rooting
out
every
vestige
of
the
hated
copernican
theory
from
the
mind
of
the
world
two
may
be
taken
as
typical
the
first
of
these
was
a
work
by
scipio
chiaramonti
dedicated
to
cardinal
barberini
among
his
arguments
against
the
double
motion
of
the
earth
may
be
cited
the
following
animals
which
move
have
limbs
and
muscles
the
earth
has
no
limbs
or
muscles
therefore
it
does
not
move
it
is
angels
who
make
saturn
jupiter
the
sun
turn
round
if
the
earth
revolves
it
must
also
have
an
angel
in
the
centre
to
set
it
in
motion
but
only
devils
live
there
it
would
therefore
be
a
devil
who
would
impart
motion
to
the
earth
the
planets
the
sun
the
fixed
stars
all
belong
to
one
species
namely
that
of
stars
it
seems
therefore
to
be
a
grievous
wrong
to
place
the
earth
which
is
a
sink
of
impurity
among
these
heavenly
bodies
which
are
pure
and
divine
things
the
next
which
i
select
from
the
mass
of
similar
works
is
the
anticopernicus
catholicus
of
polacco
it
was
intended
to
deal
a
finishing
stroke
at
galileo
heresy
in
this
it
is
declared
the
scripture
always
represents
the
earth
as
at
rest
and
the
sun
and
moon
as
in
motion
or
if
these
latter
bodies
are
ever
represented
as
at
rest
scripture
represents
this
as
the
result
of
a
great
miracle
these
writings
must
be
prohibited
because
they
teach
certain
principles
about
the
position
and
motion
of
the
terrestrial
globe
repugnant
to
holy
scripture
and
to
the
catholic
interpretation
of
it
not
as
hypotheses
but
as
established
facts
speaking
of
galileo
book
polacco
says
that
it
smacked
of
copernicanism
and
that
when
this
was
shown
to
the
inquisition
galileo
was
thrown
into
prison
and
was
compelled
to
utterly
abjure
the
baseness
of
this
erroneous
dogma
as
to
the
authority
of
the
cardinals
in
their
decree
polacco
asserts
that
since
they
are
the
pope
council
and
his
brothers
their
work
is
one
except
that
the
pope
is
favoured
with
special
divine
enlightenment
having
shown
that
the
authority
of
the
scriptures
of
popes
and
of
cardinals
is
against
the
new
astronomy
he
gives
a
refutation
based
on
physics
he
asks
if
we
concede
the
motion
of
the
earth
why
is
it
that
an
arrow
shot
into
the
air
falls
back
to
the
same
spot
while
the
earth
and
all
things
on
it
have
in
the
meantime
moved
very
rapidly
toward
the
east
who
does
not
see
that
great
confusion
would
result
from
this
motion
next
he
argues
from
metaphysics
as
follows
the
copernican
theory
of
the
earth
motion
is
against
the
nature
of
the
earth
itself
because
the
earth
is
not
only
cold
but
contains
in
itself
the
principle
of
cold
but
cold
is
opposed
to
motion
and
even
destroys
it
as
is
evident
in
animals
which
become
motionless
when
they
become
cold
finally
he
clinches
all
with
a
piece
of
theological
reasoning
as
follows
since
it
can
certainly
be
gathered
from
scripture
that
the
heavens
move
above
the
earth
and
since
a
circular
motion
requires
something
immovable
around
which
to
move
the
earth
is
at
the
centre
of
the
universe

the
date
of
it
is
but
any
sketch
of
the
warfare
between
theology
and
science
in
this
field
would
be
incomplete
without
some
reference
to
the
treatment
of
galileo
after
his
death
he
had
begged
to
be
buried
in
his
family
tomb
in
santa
croce
this
request
was
denied
his
friends
wished
to
erect
a
monument
over
him
this
too
was
refused
pope
urban
said
to
the
ambassador
niccolini
that
it
would
be
an
evil
example
for
the
world
if
such
honours
were
rendered
to
a
man
who
had
been
brought
before
the
roman
inquisition
for
an
opinion
so
false
and
erroneous
who
had
communicated
it
to
many
others
and
who
had
given
so
great
a
scandal
to
christendom
in
accordance
therefore
with
the
wish
of
the
pope
and
the
orders
of
the
inquisition
galileo
was
buried
ignobly
apart
from
his
family
without
fitting
ceremony
without
monument
without
epitaph
not
until
forty
years
after
did
pierrozzi
dare
write
an
inscription
to
be
placed
above
his
bones
not
until
a
hundred
years
after
did
nelli
dare
transfer
his
remains
to
a
suitable
position
in
santa
croce
and
erect
a
monument
above
them
even
then
the
old
conscientious
hostility
burst
forth
the
inquisition
was
besought
to
prevent
such
honours
to
a
man
condemned
for
notorious
errors
and
that
tribunal
refused
to
allow
any
epitaph
to
be
placed
above
him
which
had
not
been
submitted
to
its
censorship
nor
has
that
old
conscientious
consistency
in
hatred
yet
fully
relented
hardly
a
generation
since
has
not
seen
some
ecclesiastic
like
marini
or
de
bonald
or
rallaye
or
de
gabriac
suppressing
evidence
or
torturing
expressions
or
inventing
theories
to
blacken
the
memory
of
galileo
and
save
the
reputation
of
the
church
nay
more
there
are
school
histories
widely
used
which
in
the
supposed
interest
of
the
church
misrepresent
in
the
grossest
manner
all
these
transactions
in
which
galileo
was
concerned
sancta
simplicitas
the
church
has
no
worse
enemies
than
those
who
devise
and
teach
these
perversions
they
are
simply
rooting
out
in
the
long
run
from
the
minds
of
the
more
thoughtful
scholars
respect
for
the
great
organization
which
such
writings
are
supposed
to
serve
for
the
persecutions
of
galileo

death

both

but
unlike
monsignor
marini
are
too
upright
to
resort
to
the
pious
fraud
of
suppressing
documents
or
interpolating
pretended
facts
the
protestant
church
was
hardly
less
energetic
against
this
new
astronomy
than
the
mother
church
the
sacred
science
of
the
first
lutheran
reformers
was
transmitted
as
a
precious
legacy
and
in
the
next
century
was
made
much
of
by
calovius
his
great
learning
and
determined
orthodoxy
gave
him
the
lutheran
leadership
utterly
refusing
to
look
at
ascertained
facts
he
cited
the
turning
back
of
the
shadow
upon
king
hezekiah
dial
and
the
standing
still
of
the
sun
for
joshua
denied
the
movement
of
the
earth
and
denounced
the
whole
new
view
as
clearly
opposed
to
scripture
to
this
day
his
arguments
are
repeated
by
sundry
orthodox
leaders
of
american
lutheranism
as
to
the
other
branches
of
the
reformed
church
we
have
already
seen
how
calvinists
anglicans
and
indeed
protestant
sectarians
generally
opposed
the
new
truth
for
clovius
see
zoeckler

i

and
for
calvin
and
turretin
see
shields
the

in

among
the
strict
churchmen
the
great
south
denounced
the
royal
society
as
irreligious
and
among
the
puritans
the
eminent
john
owen
declared
that
newton
discoveries
were
built
on
fallible
phenomena
and
advanced
by
many
arbitrary
presumptions
against
evident
testimonies
of
scripture
even
milton
seems
to
have
hesitated
between
the
two
systems
at
the
beginning
of
the
eighth
book
of
paradise
lost
he
makes
adam
state
the
difficulties
of
the
ptolemaic
system
and
then
brings
forward
an
angel
to
make
the
usual
orthodox
answers
later
milton
seems
to
lean
toward
the
copernican
theory
for
referring
to
the
earth

says

along
english
orthodoxy
continued
to
assert
itself
in
john
hutchinson
professor
at
cambridge
published
his
moses
principia
a
system
of
philosophy
in
which
he
sought
to
build
up
a
complete
physical
system
of
the
universe
from
the
bible
in
this
he
assaulted
the
newtonian
theory
as
atheistic
and
led
the
way
for
similar
attacks
by
such
church
teachers
as
horne
duncan
forbes
and
jones
of
nayland
but
one
far
greater
than
these
involved
himself
in
this
view
that
same
limitation
of
his
reason
by
the
simple
statements
of
scripture
which
led
john
wesley
to
declare
that
unless
witchcraft
is
true
nothing
in
the
bible
is
true
led
him
while
giving
up
the
ptolemaic
theory
and
accepting
in
a
general
way
the
copernican
to
suspect
the
demonstrations
of
newton
happily
his
inborn
nobility
of
character
lifted
him
above
any
bitterness
or
persecuting
spirit
or
any
imposition
of
doctrinal
tests
which
could
prevent
those
who
came
after
him
from
finding
their
way
to
the
truth
but
in
the
midst
of
this
vast
expanse
of
theologic
error
signs
of
right
reason
began
to
appear
both
in
england
and
america
noteworthy
is
it
that
cotton
mather
bitter
as
was
his
orthodoxy
regarding
witchcraft
accepted
in
the
modern
astronomy
fully
with
all
its
consequences
in
the
following
year
came
an
even
more
striking
evidence
that
the
new
scientific
ideas
were
making
their
way
in
england
in
thomas
burnet
published
the
sixth
edition
of
his
sacred
theory
of
the
earth
in
this
he
argues
as
usual
to
establish
the
scriptural
doctrine
of
the
earth
stability
but
in
his
preface
he
sounds
a
remarkable
warning
he
mentions
the
great
mistake
into
which
augustine
led
the
church
regarding
the
doctrine
of
the
antipodes
and
says
if
within
a
few
years
or
in
the
next
generation
it
should
prove
as
certain
and
demonstrable
that
the
earth
is
moved
as
it
is
now
that
there
are
antipodes
those
that
have
been
zealous
against
it
and
engaged
the
scripture
in
the
controversy
would
have
the
same
reason
to
repent
of
their
forwardness
that
augustine
would
now
if
he
were
still
alive
fortunately
too
protestantism
had
no
such
power
to
oppose
the
development
of
the
copernican
ideas
as
the
older
church
had
enjoyed
yet
there
were
some
things
in
its
warfare
against
science
even
more
indefensible
in
the
famous
english
expedition
for
scientific
discovery
sailed
from
england
under
captain
cook
greatest
by
far
of
all
the
scientific
authorities
chosen
to
accompany
it
was
priestley
sir
joseph
banks
had
especially
invited
him
but
the
clergy
of
oxford
and
cambridge
interfered
priestley
was
considered
unsound
in
his
views
of
the
trinity
it
was
evidently
suspected
that
this
might
vitiate
his
astronomical
observations
he
was
rejected
and
the
expedition
crippled
the
orthodox
view
of
astronomy
lingered
on
in
other
branches
of
the
protestant
church
in
germany
even
leibnitz
attacked
the
newtonian
theory
of
gravitation
on
theological
grounds
though
he
found
some
little
consolation
in
thinking
that
it
might
be
used
to
support
the
lutheran
doctrine
of
consubstantiation
in
holland
the
calvinistic
church
was
at
first
strenuous
against
the
whole
new
system
but
we
possess
a
comical
proof
that
calvinism
even
in
its
strongholds
was
powerless
against
it

side
devoted
one
part
of

have
efforts

been
wanting

the

absolutely
incompatible
with

belief

dissolved

in
ridicule
in

the
wisdom
of
the
catholic
church
in

more
civilized
countries
has
prevented
its
yielding
to
some
astounding
errors
into
which
one
part
of
the
protestant
church
has
fallen
heedlessly
though
various

in

have
committed
the
absurd
error
of

misstate
the
galileo
episode
with
the
certainty
of
ultimately
undermining
confidence
in
her
teachings
among
her
more
thoughtful
young
men
she
has
kept
clear
of
the
folly
of
continuing
to
tie
her
instruction
and
the
acceptance
of
our
sacred
books
to
an
adoption
of
the
ptolemaic
theory
not
so
with
american
lutheranism
in
was
published
in
louis
at
the
publishing
house
of
the
lutheran
synod
of
missouri
a
work
entitled
astronomische
unterredung
the
author
being
well
known
as
a
late
president
of
a
lutheran
teachers
seminary
no
attack
on
the
whole
modern
system
of
astronomy
could
be
more
bitter
on
the
first
page
of
the
introduction
the
author
after
stating
the
two
theories
asks
which
is
right
and
says
it
would
be
very
simple
to
me
which
is
right
if
it
were
only
a
question
of
human
import
but
the
wise
and
truthful
god
has
expressed
himself
on
this
matter
in
the
bible
the
entire
holy
scripture
settles
the
question
that
the
earth
is
the
principal
body
hauptkorper
of
the
universe
that
it
stands
fixed
and
that
sun
and
moon
only
serve
to
light
it
the
author
then
goes
on
to
show
from
scripture
the
folly
not
only
of
copernicus
and
newton
but
of
a
long
line
of
great
astronomers
in
more
recent
times
he
declares
let
no
one
understand
me
as
inquiring
first
where
truth
is
to
be
found
in
the
bible
or
with
the
astronomers
no
i
know
that
beforehand
that
my
god
never
lies
never
makes
a
mistake
out
of
his
mouth
comes
only
truth
when
he
speaks
of
the
structure
of
the
universe
of
the
earth
sun
moon
and
stars
because
the
truth
of
the
holy
scripture
is
involved
in
this
therefore
the
above
question
is
of
the
highest
importance
to
me
scientists
and
others
lean
upon
the
miserable
reed
rohrstab
that
god
teaches
only
the
order
of
salvation
but
not
the
order
of
the
universe
very
noteworthy
is
the
fact
that
this
late
survival
of
an
ancient
belief
based
upon
is
found
not
in
the
teachings
of
any
zealous
priest
of
the
mother
church
but
in
those
of
an
eminent
professor
in
that
branch
of
protestantism
which
claims
special
enlightenment
for
the
amusing
details
of
the
attempt
in
the
english
church
to
repress
science

we
return
now
to
the
sequel
of
the
galileo
case
having
gained
their
victory
over
galileo
living
and
dead
having
used
it
to
scare
into

the
professors
of
astronomy
throughout
europe
conscientious
churchmen
exulted
loud
was
their
rejoicing
that
the
heresy
the
infidelity
the
atheism
involved
in
believing
that
the
earth
revolves
about
its
axis
and
moves
around
the
sun
had
been
crushed
by
the
great
tribunal
of
the
church
acting
in
strict
obedience
to
the
expressed
will
of
one
pope
and
the
written
order
of
another
as
we
have
seen
all
books
teaching
this
hated
belief
were
put
upon
the
index
of
books
forbidden
to
christians
and
that
index
was
prefaced
by
a
bull
enforcing
this
condemnation
upon
the
consciences
of
the
faithful
throughout
the
world
and
signed
by
the
reigning
pope
the
losses
to
the
world
during
this
complete
triumph
of
theology
were
even
more
serious
than
at
first
appears
one
must
especially
be
mentioned
there
was
then
in
europe
one
of
the
greatest
thinkers
ever
given
to
mankind
rene
descartes
mistaken
though
many
of
his
reasonings
were
they
bore
a
rich
fruitage
of
truth
he
had
already
done
a
vast
work
his
theory
of
vortices
assuming
a
uniform
material
regulated
by
physical
laws
as
the
beginning
of
the
visible
universe
though
it
was
but
a
provisional
hypothesis
had
ended
the
whole
old
theory
of
the
heavens
with
the
vaulted
firmament
and
the
direction
of
the
planetary
movements
by
angels
which
even
kepler
had
allowed
the
scientific
warriors
had
stirred
new
life
in
him
and
he
was
working
over
and
summing
up
in
his
mighty
mind
all
the
researches
of
his
time
the
result
would
have
made
an
epoch
in
history
his
aim
was
to
combine
all
knowledge
and
thought
into
a
treatise
on
the
world
and
in
view
of
this
he
gave
eleven
years
to
the
study
of
anatomy
alone
but
the
fate
of
galileo
robbed
him
of
all
hope
of
all
courage
the
battle
seemed
lost
he
gave
up
his
great

but
ere
long
it
was
seen
that
this
triumph
of
the
church
was
in
reality
a
prodigious
defeat
from
all
sides
came
proofs
that
copernicus
and
galileo
were
right
and
although
pope
urban
and
the
inquisition
held
galileo
in
strict
seclusion
forbidding
him
even
to
speak
regarding
the
double
motion
of
the
earth
and
although
this
condemnation
of
all
books
which
affirm
the
motion
of
the
earth
was
kept
on
the
index
and
although
the
papal
bull
still
bound
the
index
and
the
condemnations
in
it
on
the
consciences
of
the
faithful
and
although
colleges
and
universities
under
church
control
were
compelled
to
teach
the
old
doctrine
it
was
seen
by
men
everywhere
that
this
victory
of
the
church
was
a
disaster
to
the
victors
new

pressed
on

full

was
wrote

apology
for

for
that
and
other
heresies
religious
and
political
he
seven
times
underwent
torture
and
kepler
comes
he
leads
science
on
to
greater
victories
copernicus
great
as
he
was
could
not
disentangle
scientific
reasoning
entirely
from
the
theological
bias
the
doctrines
of
aristotle
and
thomas
aquinas
as
to
the
necessary
superiority
of
the
circle
had
vitiated
the
minor
features
of
his
system
and
left
breaches
in
it
through
which
the
enemy
was
not
slow
to
enter
but
kepler
sees
these
errors
and
by
wonderful
genius
and
vigour
he
gives
to
the
world
the
three
laws
which
bear
his
name
and
this
fortress
of
science
is
complete
he
thinks
and
speaks
as
one
inspired
his
battle
is
severe
he
is
solemnly
warned
by
the
protestant
consistory
of
stuttgart
not
to
throw
christ
kingdom
into
confusion
with
his
silly
fancies
and
as
solemnly
ordered
to
bring
his
theory
of
the

into

sometimes
abused
sometimes

honour
the
memory
of
copernicus
and
to
unveil

of
him
copernicus
had
lived
a
pious
christian
life
he
had
been
beloved
for
unostentatious
christian
charity
with
his
religious
belief
no
fault
had
ever
been
found
he
was
a
canon
of
the
church
at
frauenberg
and
over
his
grave
had
been
written
the
most
touching
of
christian
epitaphs
naturally
then
the
people
expected
a
religious
service
all
was
understood
to
be
arranged
for
it
the
procession
marched
to
the
church
and
waited
the
hour
passed
and
no
priest
appeared
none
could
be
induced
to
appear
copernicus
gentle
charitable
pious
one
of
the
noblest
gifts
of
god
to
religion
as
well
as
to
science
was
evidently
still
under
the
ban
five
years
after
that
his
book
was
still
standing
on
the
index
of
books
prohibited
to
christians
the
edition
of
the
index
published
in
was
as
inexorable
toward
the
works
of
copernicus
and
galileo
as
its
predecessors
had
been
but
in
the
year
came
a
crisis
canon
settele
professor
of
astronomy
at
rome
had
written
an
elementary
book
in
which
the
copernican
system
was
taken
for
granted
the
master
of
the
sacred
palace
anfossi
as
censor
of
the
press
refused
to
allow
the
book
to
be
printed
unless
settele
revised
his
work
and
treated
the
copernican
theory
as
merely
a
hypothesis
on
this
settele
appealed
to
pope
pius
vii
and
the
pope
referred
the
matter
to
the
congregation
of
the
holy
office
at
last
on
the
of
august
it
was
decided
that
settele
might
teach
the
copernican
system
as
established
and
this
decision
was
approved
by
the
pope
this
aroused
considerable
discussion
but
finally
on
the
of
september
the
cardinals
of
the
holy
inquisition
graciously
agreed
that
the
printing
and
publication
of
works
treating
of
the
motion
of
the
earth
and
the
stability
of
the
sun
in
accordance
with
the
general
opinion
of
modern
astronomers
is
permitted
at
rome
this
decree
was
ratified
by
pius
vii
but
it
was
not
until
thirteen
years
later
in
that
there
was
issued
an
edition
of
the
index
from
which
the
condemnation
of
works
defending
the
double
motion
of
the
earth
was
left
out
this
was
not
a
moment
too
soon
for
as
if
the
previous
proofs
had
not
been
sufficient
each
of
the
motions
of
the
earth
was
now
absolutely
demonstrated
anew
so
as
to
be
recognised
by
the
ordinary
observer
the
parallax
of
fixed
stars
shown
by
bessel
as
well
as
other
noted
astronomers
in
clinched
forever
the
doctrine
of
the
revolution
of
the
earth
around
the
sun
and
in
the
great
experiment
of
foucault
with
the
pendulum
showed
to
the
human
eye
the
earth
in
motion
around
its
own
axis
to
make
the
matter

this
experiment
was
publicly
made
in
one
of
the
churches
at
rome
by
the
eminent
astronomer
father
secchi
of
the
jesuits
in
just
two
hundred
and
twenty
years
after
the
jesuits
had
done
so
much
to
secure

as
to
the
time
when
the
decree
of

was

there
have
been
various
pious
attempts
to
make
it
earlier
than

the
retreat
of
the
church
after
its
victory
over
galileo
any
history
of
the
victory
of
astronomical
science
over
dogmatic
theology
would
be
incomplete
without
some
account
of
the
retreat
made
by
the
church
from
all
its
former
positions
in
the
galileo
case
the
retreat
of
the
protestant
theologians
was
not
difficult
a
little
skilful
warping
of
scripture
a
little
skilful
use
of
that
phrase
attributed
to
cardinal
baronius
that
the
bible
is
given
to
teach
us
not
how
the
heavens
go
but
how
men
go
to
heaven
and
a
free
use
of
explosive
rhetoric
against
the
pursuing
army
of
scientists
sufficed
but
in
the
older
church
it
was
far
less
easy
the
retreat
of
the
army
of
church
apologists
lasted
through
two
centuries
in
spite
of
all
that
has
been
said
by
these
apologists
there
no
longer
remains
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
the
papal
infallibility
was
committed
fully
and
irrevocably
against
the
double
revolution
of
the
earth
as
the
documents
of
galileo
trial
now
published
show
paul
v
in
pushed
on
with
all
his
might
the
condemnation
of
galileo
and
of
the
works
of
copernicus
and
of
all
others
teaching
the
motion
of
the
earth
around
its
own
axis
and
around
the
sun
so
too
in
the
condemnation
of
galileo
in
and
in
all
the
proceedings
which
led
up
to
it
and
which
followed
it
urban
viii
was
the
central
figure
without
his
sanction
no
action
could
have
been
taken
true
the
pope
did
not
formally
sign
the
decree
against
the
copernican
theory
then
but
this
came
later
in
alexander
vii
prefixed
to
the
index
containing
the
condemnations
of
the
works
of
copernicus
and
galileo
and
all
books
which
affirm
the
motion
of
the
earth
a
papal
bull
signed
by
himself
binding
the
contents
of
the
index
upon
the
consciences
of
the
faithful
this
bull
confirmed
and
approved
in
express
terms

and
infallibly

that
the
papal

was
fully
given
the
position
of
the
mother
church
had
been
thus
made
especially
difficult
and
the
first
important
move
in
retreat
by
the
apologists
was
the
statement
that
galileo
was
condemned
not
because
he
affirmed
the
motion
of
the
earth
but
because
he
supported
it
from
scripture
there
was
a
slight
appearance
of
truth
in
this
undoubtedly
galileo
letters
to
castelli
and
the
grand
duchess
in
which
he
attempted
to
show
that
his
astronomical
doctrines
were
not
opposed
to
scripture
gave
a
new
stir
to
religious
bigotry
for
a
considerable
time
then
this
quibble
served
its
purpose
even
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
after
condemnation
it
was
renewed
by
the
protestant
mallet
du
pan
in
his
wish
to
gain
favour
from
the
older
church
but
nothing
can
be
more
absurd
in
the
light
of
the
original
documents
recently
brought
out
of
the
vatican
archives
than
to
make
this
contention
now
the
letters
of
galileo
to
castelli
and
the
were
not
published
until
after
the
condemnation
and
although
the
archbishop
of
pisa
had
endeavoured
to
use
them
against
him
they
were
but
casually
mentioned
in
and
entirely
left
out
of
view
in
what
was
condemned
in
by
the
sacred
congregation
held
in
the
presence
of
pope
paul
v
as
absurd
false
in
theology
and
heretical
because
absolutely
contrary
to
holy
scripture
was
the
proposition
that
the
sun
is
the
centre
about
which
the
earth
revolves
and
what
was
condemned
as
absurd
false
in
philosophy
and
from
a
theologic
point
of
view
at
least
opposed
to
the
true
faith
was
the
proposition
that
the
earth
is
not
the
centre
of
the
universe
and
immovable
but
has
a
diurnal
motion
and
again
what
galileo
was
made
by
express
order
of
pope
urban
and
by
the
action
of
the
inquisition
under
threat
of
torture
to
abjure
in
was
the
error
and
heresy
of
the
movement
of
the
earth
what
the
index
condemned
under
sanction
of
the
bull
issued
by
alexander
vii
in
was
all
books
teaching
the
movement
of
the
earth
and
the
stability
of
the

what
the
index
prefaced
by
papal
bulls
infallibly
binding
its
contents
upon
the
consciences
of
the
faithful
for
nearly
two
hundred
years
steadily
condemned
was
all
books
which
affirm
the
motion
of

not

these
condemnations
was

of

of
the
venetian
institute
for

especially
pp
and
following
having
been
dislodged
from
this
point
the
church
apologists
sought
cover
under
the
statement
that
galileo
was
condemned
not
for
heresy
but
for
contumacy
and
want
of
respect
toward
the
pope
there
was
a
slight
chance
also
for
this
quibble
no
doubt
urban
viii
one
of
the
haughtiest
of
pontiffs
was
induced
by
galileo
enemies
to
think
that
he
had
been
treated
with
some
lack
of
proper
etiquette
first
by
galileo
adhesion
to
his
own
doctrines
after
his
condemnation
in
and
next
by
his
supposed
reference
in
the
dialogue
of
to
the
arguments
which
the
pope
had
used
against
him
but
it
would
seem
to
be
a
very
poor
service
rendered
to
the
doctrine
of
papal
infallibility
to
claim
that
a
decision
so
immense
in
its
consequences
could
be
influenced
by
the
personal
resentment
of
the
reigning
pontiff
again
as
to
the
first
point
the
very
language
of
the
various
sentences
shows
the
folly
of
this
assertion
for
these
sentences
speak
always
of
heresy
and
never
of
contumacy
as
to
the
last
point
the
display
of
the
original
documents
settled
that
forever
they
show
galileo
from
first
to
last
as
most
submissive
toward
the
pope
and
patient
under
the
papal
arguments
and
exactions
he
had
indeed
expressed
his
anger
at
times
against
his
traducers
but
to
hold
this
the
cause
of
the
judgment
against
him
is
to
degrade
the
whole
proceedings
and
to
convict
paul
v
urban
viii
bellarmin
the
other
theologians
and
the
inquisition
of
direct
falsehood
since
they
assigned
entirely
different
reasons
for
their
conduct
from
this
position
therefore
the
assailants
retreated
the
invention
of
the
contumacy
quibble
seems
due
to
monsignor
marini
who
appears
also
to
have
manipulated
the
original
documents
to
prove
it
even
whewell
was
evidently
somewhat
misled
by
him
but
whewell
wrote
before
had
shown
all
the
documents
and
under
the
supposition
that
marini
was
an
honest
man
the
next
rally
was
made
about
the
statement
that
the
persecution
of
galileo
was
the
result
of
a
quarrel
between
aristotelian
professors
on
one
side
and
professors
favouring
the
experimental
method
on
the
other
but
this
position
was
attacked
and
carried
by
a
very
simple
statement
if
the
divine
guidance
of
the
church
is
such
that
it
can
be
dragged
into
a
professorial
squabble
and
made
the
tool
of
a
faction
in
bringing
about
a
most
disastrous
condemnation
of
a
proved
truth
how
did
the
church
at
that
time
differ
from
any
human
organization
sunk
into
decrepitude
managed
nominally
by
simpletons
but
really
by
schemers
if
that
argument
be
true
the
condition
of
the
church
was
even
worse
than
its
enemies
have
declared
it
and
amid
the
jeers
of
an
unfeeling
world
the
apologists
sought
new
shelter
the
next
point
at
which
a
stand
was
made
was
the
assertion
that
the
condemnation
of
galileo
was
provisory
but
this
proved
a
more
treacherous
shelter
than
the
others
the
wording
of
the
decree
of
condemnation
itself
is
a
sufficient
answer
to
this
claim
when
doctrines
have
been
solemnly
declared
as
those
of
galileo
were
solemnly
declared
under
sanction
of
the
highest
authority
in
the
church
contrary
to
the
sacred
scriptures
opposed
to
the
true
faith
and
false
and
absurd
in
theology
and
philosophy
to
say
that
such
declarations
are
provisory
is
to
say
that
the
truth
held
by
the
church
is
not
immutable
from
this
then
the
apologists
retreated
this
argument
also
seems
to
have
been
foisted
upon
the
world
by
the
wily
monsignor
marini
still
another
contention
was
made
in
some
respects
more
curious
than
any
other
it
was
mainly
that
galileo
was
no
more
a
victim
of
catholics
than
of
protestants
for
they
more
than
the
catholic
theologians
impelled
the
pope
to
the
action
taken
see
the
rev
kirsch
on
professor
huxley
and
evolution
in
the
american
catholic
quarterly
october
the
article
is
as
a
whole
remarkably
and
in
the
main
just
as
to
the
protestant
attitude
and
as
to
the
causes
underlying
the
whole
action
against
galileo
but
if
protestantism
could
force
the
papal
hand
in
a
matter
of
this
magnitude
involving
vast
questions
of
belief
and
questions
of
policy
what
becomes
of
inerrancy
of
special
protection
and
guidance
of
the
papal
authority
in
matters
of
faith
while
this
retreat
from
position
to
position
was
going
on
there
was
a
constant
discharge
of
in
the
shape
of
innuendoes
hints
and
sophistries
every
effort
was
made
to
blacken
galileo
private
character
the
irregularities
of
his
early
life
were
dragged
forth
and
stress
was
even
laid
upon
breaches
of
etiquette
but
this
succeeded
so
poorly
that
even
as
far
back
as
it
was
thought
necessary
to
cover
the
retreat
by
some
more
careful
strategy
this
new
strategy
is
instructive
the
original
documents
of
the
galileo
trial
had
been
brought
during
the
napoleonic
conquests
to
paris
but
in
they
were
returned
to
rome
by
the
french
government
on
the
express
pledge
by
the
papal
authorities
that
they
should
be
published
in
after
many
delays
on
various
pretexts
the
publication
appeared
the
personage
charged
with
presenting
them
to
the
world
was
monsignor
marini
this
ecclesiastic
was
of
a
kind
which
has
too
often
afflicted
both
the
church
and
the
world
at
large
despite
the
solemn
promise
of
the
papal
court
the
wily
marini
became
the
instrument
of
the
roman
authorities
in
evading
the
promise
by
suppressing
a
document
here
and
interpolating
a
statement
there
he
managed
to
give
plausible
for
nearly
every
important
sophistry
ever
broached
to
save
the
infallibility
of
the
church
and
destroy
the
reputation
of
galileo
he
it
was
who
supported
the
idea
that
galileo
was
condemned
not
for
heresy
but
for
contumacy
the
first
effect
of
monsignor
marini
book
seemed
useful
in
covering
the
retreat
of
the
church
apologists
aided
by
him
such
vigorous
writers
as
ward
were
able
to
throw
up
temporary
intrenchments
between
the
roman
authorities
and
the
indignation
of
the
world
but
some
time
later
came
an
investigator
very
different
from
monsignor
marini
this
was
a
frenchman
like
marini
was
devoted
to
the
church
but
unlike
marini
he
could
not
lie
having
obtained
access
in
to
the
galileo
documents
at
the
vatican
he
published
several
of
the
most
important
without
suppression
or
manipulation
this
made
all
the
intrenchments
based
upon
marini
statements
untenable
another
retreat
had
to
be
made
and
now
came
the
most
desperate
effort
of
all
the
apologetic
army
reviving
an
idea
which
the
popes
and
the
church
had
spurned
for
centuries
declared
that
the
popes
as
popes
had
never
condemned
the
doctrines
of
copernicus
and
galileo
that
they
had
condemned
them
as
men
simply
that
therefore
the
church
had
never
been
committed
to
them
that
the
condemnation
was
made
by
the
cardinals
of
the
inquisition
and
index
and
that
the
pope
had
evidently
been
restrained
by
interposition
of
providence
from
signing
their
condemnation
nothing
could
show
the
desperation
of
the
retreating
party
better
than
jugglery
like
this
the
fact
is
that
in
the
official
account
of
the
condemnation
by
bellarmin
in
he
declares
distinctly
that
he
makes
this
condemnation
in
the
name
of
his
holiness
the
pope
see

citation
from
the
vatican
manuscript
given
in

from

point
that

not
sanctioned

such
an
eminent
theological
authority

him
and
declared
that
it
was
not
certain
cardinals
but
the
supreme
authority
of
the
church
that
had
condemned
galileo
and
to
this
statement
the
pope
and
other
church
authorities
gave
consent
either
openly
or
by
silence
when
descartes
and
others
attempted
to
raise
the
same
point
they
were
treated
with
contempt
father
castelli
who
had
devoted
himself
to
galileo
and
knew
to
his
cost
just
what
the
condemnation
meant
and
who
made
it
takes
it

it

writing
under
church
inspection
and
approval
at
the
time
took
the
view
that
the
pope
and
the
church
condemned
galileo
and
this
was
never
denied
at
rome
the
inquisition
itself
backed
by
the
greatest
theologian
of
the
time
bellarmin
took
the
same
view
not
only
does
he
declare
that
he
makes
the
condemnation
in
the
name
of
his
holiness
the
pope
but
we
have
the
roman
index
containing
the
condemnation
for
nearly
two
hundred
years
prefaced
by
a
solemn
bull
of
the
reigning
pope
binding
this
condemnation
on
the
consciences
of
the
whole
church
and
declaring
year
after
year
that
all
books
which
affirm
the
motion
of
the
earth
are
damnable
to
attempt
to
face
all
this
added
to
the
fact
that
galileo
was
required
to
abjure
the
heresy
of
the
movement
of
the
earth
by
written
order
of
the
pope
was
soon
seen
to
be
impossible
against

heresy
the
sufficient
answer
to
all
this
is
that
the
words
of
the
inflexible
sentence
designating
the
condemned
books
are
libri
omnes
qui
affirmant
telluris
motum
see
bertrand
as
to
the
idea
that
galileo
was
punished
for
not
his
opinion
but
for
basing
it
on
scripture
the
answer
may
be
found
in
the
roman
index
of
in
which
are
noted
for
condemnation
libri
omnes
docentes
mobilitatem
terrae
et
immobilitatem
solis
for
the
way
in
which
when
it
was
found
convenient
in
argument
church
apologists
insisted
that
it
was
the
supreme
chief
of
the
church
by
a
pontifical
decree
and
not
certain
cardinals
who
condemned
galileo
and
his
doctrine

own
declarations
as
given
by
martin
for
the
way
in
which
when
necessary
church
apologists
asserted
the
very
contrary
of
this
declaring
that
it
was
issued
in
a
doctrinal
degree
of
the
congregation
of
the
index
and
not
as
the

see

review
september
this
contention
then
was
at
last
utterly
given
up
by
honest
catholics
themselves
in
a
roman
catholic
clergy
man
in
england
the
rev
roberts
evidently
thinking
that
the
time
had
come
to
tell
the
truth
published
a
book
entitled
the
pontifical
decrees
against
the
movement
and
in
this
exhibited
the
incontrovertible
evidences
that
the
papacy
had
committed
itself
and
its
infallibility
fully
against
the
movement
of
the
earth
this
catholic
clergyman
showed
from
the
original
record
that
pope
paul
v
in
had
presided
over
the
tribunal
condemning
the
doctrine
of
the
earth
movement
and
ordering
galileo
to
give
up
the
opinion
he
showed
that
pope
urban
viii
in
pressed
on
directed
and
promulgated
the
final
condemnation
making
himself
in
all
these
ways
responsible
for
it
and
finally
he
showed
that
pope
alexander
vii
in
by
his
bull
speculatores
domus
israel
attached
to
the
index
condemning
all
books
which
affirm
the
motion
of
the
earth
had
absolutely
pledged
the
papal
infallibility
against
the
earth
movement
he
also
confessed
that
under
the
rules
laid
down
by
the
highest
authorities
in
the
church
and
especially
by
sixtus
v
and
pius
ix
there
was
no
escape
from
this
conclusion
various
theologians
attempted
to
evade
the
force
of
the
argument
some
like
ward
and
bouix
took
refuge
in
verbal
niceties
some
like
jeremiah
murphy
comforted
themselves
with
declamation
the
only
result
was
that
in
came
another
edition
of
the
rev
roberts
work
even
more
cogent
than
the
first
and
besides
this
an
essay
by
that
eminent
catholic
george
mivart
acknowledging
the
rev
roberts
position
to
be
impregnable
and
declaring
virtually
that
the
almighty
allowed
pope
and
church
to
fall
into
complete
error
regarding
the
copernican
theory
in
order
to
teach
them
that
science
lies
outside
their
province
and
that
the
true
priesthood
of
scientific
truth
rests
with
scientific
investigators
alone
for
the
crushing
answer
by
two
eminent
roman
catholics
to
the
sophistries
cited
an
answer
which
does
infinitely
more
credit
to
the
older
church
that
all
the
perverted
ingenuity
used
in
concealing
the
truth
or
breaking
the
force
of
it
see
roberts
and
george
mivart
as
already
cited
in
spite
then
of
all
casuistry
and
special
pleading
this
sturdy
honesty
ended
the
controversy
among
catholics
themselves
so
far
as
men
are
concerned
in
recalling
it
at
this
day
there
stand
out
from
its
later
phases
two
efforts
at
compromise
especially
instructive
as
showing
the
embarrassment
of
militant
theology
in
the
nineteenth
century
the
first
of
these
was
made
by
john
henry
newman
in
the
days
when
he
was
hovering
between
the
anglican
and
roman
churches
in
one
of
his
sermons
before
the
university
of
oxford
he
spoke
as
follows
scripture
says
that
the
sun
moves
and
the
earth
is
stationary
and
science
that
the
earth
moves
and
the
sun
is
comparatively
at
rest
how
can
we
determine
which
of
these
opposite
statements
is
the
very
truth
till
we
know
what
motion
is
if
our
idea
of
motion
is
but
an
accidental
result
of
our
present
senses
neither
proposition
is
true
and
both
are
true
neither
true
philosophically
both
true
for
certain
practical
purposes
in
the
system
in
which
they
are
respectively
found
in
all
literature
there
is
no
utterance
more
hopelessly
skeptical
and
for
what
were
the
youth
of
oxford
led
into
such
bottomless
depths
of
disbelief
as
to
any
real
existence
of
truth
or
any
real
foundation
for
it
simply
to
save
an
outworn
system
of
interpretation
into
which
the
gifted
preacher
happened
to
be
born
the
other
utterance
was
suggested
by
de
bonald
and
developed
in
the
dublin
review
as
is
understood
by
one
of
newman
associates
this
argument
was
nothing
less
than
an
attempt
to
retreat
under
the
charge
of
deception
against
the
almighty
himself
it
is
as
follows
but
it
may
well
be
doubted
whether
the
church
did
retard
the
progress
of
scientific
truth
what
retarded
it
was
the
circumstance
that
god
has
thought
fit
to
express
many
texts
of
scripture
in
words
which
have
every
appearance
of
denying
the
earth
motion
but
it
is
god
who
did
this
not
the
church
and
moreover
since
he
saw
fit
so
to
act
as
to
retard
the
progress
of
scientific
truth
it
would
be
little
to
her
discredit
even
if
it
were
true
that
she
had
followed
his
example
this
argument
like
gosse
famous
attempt
to
reconcile
geology
to
genesis
by
supposing
that
for
some
inscrutable
purpose
god
deliberately
deceived
the
thinking
world
by
giving
to
the
earth
all
the
appearances
of
development
through
long
periods
of
time
while
really
creating
it
in
six
days
each
of
an
evening
and
a
morning
seems
only
to
have
awakened
the
amazed
pity
of
thinking
men
this
like
the
argument
of
newman
was
a
last
desperate
effort
of
anglican
and
roman
divines
to
save
something
from
the
wreckage
of
dogmatic
theology
for
the
quotation
from
newman
see
his
sermons
on
the
theory
of
religious
belief
sermon
xiv
cited
by
bishop
goodwin
in

review

january
for
the
attempt
to
take
the
blame
off
the
shoulders
of
both
pope
and
cardinals
and
place
it
upon
the
almighty

fairness
see
th
martin
vie
de

though
there
is
some
special
pleading
to
save
the
infallibility
of
the
pope
and

close
is

as
to
a

later

the
main
thing
in
it
being
an
attempt
to
establish
against
the
honest
and
honourable
concessions
of
catholics
like
roberts
and
mivart
sundry
and
distinctions
between
dogmatic
and
disciplinary
bulls
an
attempt
which
will
only
deepen
the
distrust
of
straightforward
reasoners
the
author
point
of
view
is
stated
in
the
words
i
have
maintained
that
the
church
has
a
right
to
lay
her
restraining
hand
on
the
speculations
of
natural
science
all
these
defenders
of
the
faith
but
wrought
into
the
hearts
of
great
numbers
of
thinking
men
the
idea
that
there
is
a
necessary
antagonism
between
science
and
religion
like
the
landsman
who
lashes
himself
to
the
anchor
of
the
sinking
ship
they
simply
attached
christianity
by
the
strongest
cords
of
logic
which
they
could
spin
to
these
mistaken
ideas
in
science
and
could
they
have
had
their
way
the
advance
of
knowledge
would
have
ingulfed
both
together
on
the
other
hand

had
science
done

religion

the
conquest
made
in
this
long
struggle
by
science
for
religion
as
a
pendant
to
this
ejaculation
of
kepler
may
be
cited
the
words
of
linnaeus
deum
ominpotentem
a
tergo
transeuntem
vidi
et
obstupui
nothing
is
more
unjust
than
to
cast
especial
blame
for
all
this
resistance
to
science
upon
the
roman
church
the
protestant
church
though
rarely
able
to
be
so
severe
has
been
more
blameworthy
the
persecution
of
galileo
and
his
compeers
by
the
older
church
was
mainly
at
the
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
persecution
of
robertson
smith
and
winchell
and
woodrow
and
toy
and
the
young
professors
at
beyrout
by
various
protestant
authorities
was
near
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
those
earlier
persecutions
by
catholicism
were
strictly
in
accordance
with
principles
held
at
that
time
by
all
religionists
catholic
and
protestant
throughout
the
world
these
later
persecutions
by
protestants
were
in
defiance
of
principles
which
all
protestants
hold
or
pretend
to
hold
and
none
make
louder
claim
to
hold
them
than
the
very
sects
which
persecuted
these
eminent
christian
men
of
our
day
men
whose
crime
was
that
they
were
intelligent
enough
to
accept
the
science
of
their
time
and
honest
enough
to
acknowledge
it
most
unjustly
then
would
protestantism
taunt
catholicism
for
excluding
knowledge
of
astronomical
truths
from
european
catholic
universities
in
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
while
real
knowledge
of
geological
and
biological
and
anthropological
truth
is
denied
or
pitifully
diluted
in
so
many
american
protestant
colleges
and
universities
in
the
nineteenth
century
nor
has
protestantism
the
right
to
point
with
scorn
to
the
catholic
index
and
to
lay
stress
on
the
fact
that
nearly
every
really
important
book
in
the
last
three
centuries
has
been
forbidden
by
it
so
long
as
young
men
in
so
many
american
protestant
universities
and
colleges
are
nursed
with
ecclesiastical
pap
rather
than
with
real
thought
and
directed
to
the
works
of
solemnly
constituted
impostors
or
to
sundry
approved
courses
of
reading
while
they
are
studiously
kept
aloof
from
such
leaders
in
modern
thought
as
darwin
spencer
huxley
draper
and
lecky
it
may
indeed
be
justly
claimed
by
protestantism
that
some
of
the
former
strongholds
of
her
bigotry
have
become
liberalized
but
on
the
other
hand
catholicism
can
point
to
the
fact
that
pope
leo
xiii
now
happily
reigning
has
made
a
noble
change
as
regards
open
dealing
with
documents
the
days
of
monsignor
marini
it
may
be
hoped
are
gone
the
vatican
library
with
its
masses
of
historical
material
has
been
thrown
open
to
protestant
and
catholic
scholars
alike
and
this
privilege
has
been
freely
used
by
men
representing
all
shades
of
religious
thought
as
to
the
older
errors
the
whole
civilized
world
was
at
fault
protestant
as
well
as
catholic
it
was
not
the
fault
of
religion
it
was
the
fault
of
that
linking
of
theological
dogmas
to
scriptural
texts
which
in
utter
defiance
of
the
words
and
works
of
the
blessed
founder
of
christianity
men
are
ever
prone
to
substitute
for
religion
justly
is
it
said
by
one
of
the
most
eminent
among
contemporary
anglican
divines
that
it
is
because
they
have
mistaken
the
dawn
for
a
conflagration
that
theologians
have
so
often
been
foes
of
light
for
an
exceedingly
striking
statement
by
a
roman
catholic
historian
of
genius
as
to
the
popular
demand
for
persecution
and
the
pressure
of
the

in
under

out
of

had
come
a

of

regarding

meteors

all
these
were
held
to

for

stars
and
meteors
were
generally
thought
to
presage
happy
events

the

of

rooted

as
well
as

and
others
the
same
conception
entered
into
our
christian
sacred
books
of
all
the
legends
which
grew
in
such
luxuriance
and
beauty
about
the
cradle
of
jesus
of
nazareth
none
appeals
more
directly
to
the
highest
poetic
feeling
than
that
given
by
one
of
the
evangelists
in
which
a
star
rising
in
the
east
conducted
the
wise
men
to
the
manger
where
the
galilean
the
hope
of
mankind
the
light
of
the
world
was
lying
in
poverty
and
helplessness
among
the
mohammedans
we
have
a
curious
example
of
the
same
tendency
toward
a
kindly
interpretation
of
stars
and
meteors
in
the
belief
of
certain
mohammedan
teachers
that
meteoric
showers
are
caused
by
good
angels
hurling
missiles
to
drive
evil
angels
out
of
the
sky
eclipses
were
regarded
in
a
very
different
light
being
supposed
to
express
the
distress
of
nature
at
earthly
calamities
the
greeks
believed
that
darkness
overshadowed
the
earth
at
the
deaths
of
prometheus
atreus
hercules
aesculapius
and
alexander
the
great
the
roman
legends
held
that
at
the
death
of
romulus
there
was
darkness
for
six
hours
in
the
history
of
the
caesars
occur
portents
of
all
three
kinds
for
at
the
death
of
julius
the
earth
was
shrouded
in
darkness
the
birth
of
augustus
was
heralded
by
a
star
and
the
downfall
of
nero
by
a
comet
so
too
in
one
of
the
christian
legends
clustering
about
the
crucifixion
darkness
overspread
the
earth
from
the
sixth
to
the
ninth
hour
neither
the
silence
regarding
it
of
the
only
evangelist
who
claims
to
have
been
present
nor
the
fact
that
observers
like
seneca
and
pliny
who
though
they
carefully
described
much
less
striking
occurrences
of
the
same
sort
and
in
more
remote
regions
failed
to
note
any
such
darkness
even
in
judea
have
availed
to
shake
faith
in
an
account
so
true
to
the
highest
poetic
instincts
of
humanity
this
view
of
the
relations
between
nature
and
man
continued
among
both
jews
and
christians
according
to
jewish
tradition
darkness
overspread
the
earth
for
three
days
when
the
books
of
the
law
were
profaned
by
translation
into
greek
tertullian
thought
an
eclipse
an
evidence
of
god
wrath
against
unbelievers
nor
has
this
mode
of
thinking
ceased
in
modern
times

claim
was
made
at

expected
eclipses
to
be
the
final
tokens
of
woe
at
the
destruction
of
the
world
and
traces
of
this
feeling
have
come
down
to
our
own
time
the
quaint
story
of
the
connecticut
statesman
who
when
his
associates
in
the
general
assembly
were
alarmed
by
an
eclipse
of
the
sun
and
thought
it
the
beginning
of
the
day
of
judgment
quietly
ordered
in
candles
that
he
might
in

the
story
of
abraham

has
been
made
familiar
by
the
poem
of
whittier
in
these
beliefs
regarding
meteors
and
eclipses
there
was
little
calculated
to
do
harm
by
arousing
that
superstitious
terror
which
is
the
worst
of
cruelty
far
otherwise
was
it
with
the
belief
regarding
comets
during
many
centuries
it
gave
rise
to
the
direst
superstition
and
fanaticism
the
chaldeans
alone
among
the
ancient
peoples
generally
regarded
comets
without
fear
and
thought
them
bodies
wandering
as
harmless
as
fishes
in
the
sea
the
pythagoreans
alone
among
philosophers
seem
to
have
had
a
vague
idea
of
them
as
bodies
returning
at
fixed
periods
of
time
and
in
all
antiquity
so
far
as
is
known
one
man
alone
seneca
had
the
scientific
instinct
and
prophetic
inspiration
to
give
this
idea
definite
shape
and
to
declare
that
the
time
would
come
when
comets
would
be
found
to
move
in
accordance
with
natural
law
here
and
there
a
few
strong
men
rose
above
the
prevailing
superstition
the
emperor
vespasian
tried
to
laugh
it
down
and
insisted
that
a
certain
comet
in
his
time
could
not
betoken
his
death
because
it
was
hairy
and
he
bald
but
such
scoffing
produced
little
permanent
effect
and
the
prophecy
of
seneca
was
soon
forgotten
these
and
similar
isolated
utterances
could
not
stand
against
the
mass
of
opinion
which
upheld
the
doctrine
that
comets
are
signs
and
wonders
for
terror
caused
in
rome

evils
thence
arising
were
three
the
paralysis
of

arousing
of

and
the
strengthening
of
ecclesiastical
and
political
tyranny
the
first
two
of
these
evils
the
paralysis
of
and
the
arousing
of
fanaticism
are
evident
throughout
all
these
ages
at
the
appearance
of
a
comet
we
constantly
see
all
christendom
from
pope
to
peasant
instead
of
striving
to
avert
war
by
wise
statesmanship
instead
of
striving

of
god
upon
misbelievers
as
to
the
third
of
these
evils
the
strengthening
of
ecclesiastical
and
civil
despotism
examples
appear
on
every
side
it
was
natural
that
hierarchs
and
monarchs
whose
births
were
announced
by
stars
or
whose
deaths
were
announced
by
comets
should
regard
themselves
as
far
above
the
common
herd
and
should
be
so
regarded
by
mankind
passive
obedience
was
thus
strengthened
and
the
most
monstrous
assumptions
of
authority
were
considered
simply
as
manifestations
of

a
type
of
many
thus
encouraged
to
prey
upon
mankind
and

of

most
powerful
monarchs

abdicating
under

of
the

taking
refuge

essay

but
for
the
retention
of
this
belief
there
was
a
moral
cause
myriads
of
good
men
in
the
christian
church
down
to
a
recent
period
saw
in
the
appearance
of
comets
not
merely
an
exhibition
of
signs
in
the
heavens
foretold
in
scripture
but
also
divine
warnings
of
vast
value
to
humanity
as
incentives
to
repentance
and
improvement
of
indeed
so
precious
that
they
could
not
be
spared
without
danger
to
the
moral
government
of
the
world
and
this
belief
in
the
portentous
character
of
comets
as
an
essential
part
of
the
divine
government
being
as
it
was
thought
in
full
accord
with
scripture
was
made
for
centuries
a
source
of
terror
to
humanity
to
say
nothing
of
examples
in
the
earlier
periods
comets
in
the
tenth
century
especially
increased
the
distress
of
all
europe
in
the
middle
of
the
eleventh
century
a
comet
was
thought
to
accompany
the
death
of
edward
the
confessor
and
to
presage
the
norman
conquest
the
traveller
in

belief

nearly
every

of
years
throughout

saw
europe
plunged
into
alarm
by
appearances
of
this
sort
but
the
culmination
seems
to
have
been
reached
in
at
that
time
the
turks
after
a
long
effort
had
made
good
their
footing
in
europe
a
large
statesmanship
or
generalship
might
have
kept
them
out
but
while
different
religious
factions
were
disputing
over
petty
shades
of
dogma
they
had
advanced
had
taken
constantinople
and
were
evidently
securing
their
foothold
now
came
the
full
bloom
of
this
superstition
a
comet
appeared
the
pope
of
that
period
calixtus
iii
though
a
man
of
more
than
ordinary
ability
was
saturated
with
the
ideas
of
his
time
alarmed
at
this
monster
if
we
are
to
believe
the
contemporary
historian
this
infallible
head
of
the
church
solemnly
decreed
several
days
of
prayer
for
the
averting
of
the
wrath
of
god
that
whatever
calamity
impended
might
be
turned
from
the
christians
and
against
the
turks
and
that
all
might
join
daily
in
this
petition
there
was
then
established
that
midday
angelus
which
has
ever
since
called
good
catholics
to
prayer
against
the
powers
of
evil
then
too
was
incorporated
into
a
litany
the
plea
from
the
turk
and
the
comet
good
lord
deliver
us
never
was
papal
intercession
less
effective
for
the
turk
has
held
constantinople
from
that
day
to
this
while
the
obstinate
comet
being
that
now
known
under
the
name
of
halley
has
returned
imperturbably
at
short
periods
ever
since
the
usual
statement
is
that
calixtus
excommunicated
the
comet
by
a
bull
and
this
is
accepted
by
arago
grant
hoefer
guillemin
watson
and
many
historians
of
astronomy
hence
the
parallel
is
made
on
a
noted
occasion
by
president
lincoln
no
such
bull
however
is
to
be
found
in
the
published
bulleria
and
that
establishing
the
angelus
as
given
by
raynaldus
in
the
annales
eccl
contains
no
mention
of
the
comet
but
the
authority
of
platina
in
his
vitae
pontificum
venice
sub
calistus
iii
who
was
not
only
in
rome
at
the
time
but
when
he
wrote
his
history
archivist
of
the
vatican
is
final
as
to
the
attitude
platina
authority
was
never
questioned
until
modern
science
changed
the
ideas
of
the
world
the
recent
attempt
of
pastor
in
his
geschichte
der
papste
to
down
the
whole
matter
is
too
evident
an
evasion
to
carry
weight
with
those
who
know
how
even
the
most
careful
histories
have
to
be
modified
to
suit
the
views
of
the
censorship
at
rome
but
the
superstition
went
still
further
it
became
more
and
more
incorporated
into
what
was
considered
scriptural
science
and
sound
learning
the
encyclopedic
summaries
in
which
the
science
of
the
middle
ages
and
the
reformation
period
took
form
furnish
abundant
proofs
of
this
yet
scientific
observation
was
slowly
undermining
this
structure
the
inspired
prophecy
of
seneca
had
not
been
forgotten
even
as
far
back
as
the
ninth
century
in
the
midst
of
the
sacred
learning
so
abundant
at
the
court
of
charlemagne
and
his
successors
we
find
a
scholar
protesting
against
the
accepted
doctrine
in
the
thirteenth
century
we
have
a
mild
question
by
albert
the
great
as
to
the
supposed
influence
of
comets
upon
individuals
but
the
prevailing
theological
current
was
too
strong
and
he
finally
yielded
to
it
in
this
as
in
so
many
other
things
so
too
in
the
sixteenth
century
we
have
copernicus
refusing
to
accept
the
usual
theory
paracelsus
writing
to
zwingli
against
it
and
julius
caesar
scaliger
denouncing
it
as

felt
the
influence

greatest
men
on
the
side
of
this
superstition
jean
bodin
so
far
before
his
time
in
political
theories
was
only
thoroughly
abreast
of
it
in
religious
theories
the
same
reverence
for
the
mere
letter
of
scripture
which
made
him
so
fatally
powerful
in
supporting
the
witchcraft
delusion
led
him
to
support

for

among

things
referred

are
comets
eclipses

in

during

far
into

stuart
period
strype
the
ecclesiastical
annalist
gives
ample
evidence
of
this
and
among
the
more
curious
examples
is
the
surmise
that
the
comet
of
was
a
token
of
divine
wrath
provoked
by
the
bartholomew
massacre

archbishop
spottiswoode
seems
to
have

active
in
carrying
the
superstition
from
the
sixteenth

to
the
seventeenth
and
archbishop
bramhall
cites
scripture
in
support
of
it
rather
curiously
while
the
diary
of
archbishop
laud
shows
so
much
superstition
regarding
dreams
as
portents
it
shows
little
or
none
regarding
comets

as
he
was
evidently
favoured
the
usual
view
john
howe
the
eminent
nonconformist
divine
in
the
latter
part
of
the
century
seems
to
have
regarded
the
comet
superstition
as
almost
a
fundamental
article
of
belief
he
laments
the
total
neglect
of
comets
and
portents
generally
declaring
that
this
neglect
betokens
want
of
reverence
for
the
ruler
of
the
world
he
expresses
contempt
for
scientific
inquiry
regarding
comets
insists
that
they
may
be
natural
bodies
and
yet
supernatural
portents
and
ends

saying
i
conceive
it
very
safe
to
suppose
that
some
very
considerable
thing
either
in
the
way
of
judgment

may

just

to
take
effect
for
in

in

to
them
as
changing
public
opinion
somewhat
regarding
comets
and
just
before
the
middle
of

century
sir
thomas
browne
expresses
a
doubt
whether
comets
produce
such
terrible
effects
since
it
is
found
that
many
of
them
are
above
the
moon
yet
even
as
late
as
the
last
years
of
the
seventeenth
century
we
have
english
authors
of
much
power
battling
for
this
supposed
scriptural
view
and
among
the
natural
and
typical
results
we
find
in
ralph

fellow
of

royal

terrified
at
the

of

is
it
to

here
that
this

that

was
at

the
belief
in
comets
as
warnings
against
sin
was
especially
one
of
those
held
always
everywhere
and
by
all
and
by
eastern
christians
as
well
as
by
western
one
of
the
most
striking
scenes
in
the
history
of
the
eastern
church
is
that
which
took
place
at
the
condemnation
of
nikon
the
great
patriarch
of
moscow
turning
toward
his
judges
he
pointed
to
a
comet
then
blazing
in
the
sky
and
said
god
besom
shall
sweep
you
all
away
of
all
countries
in
western
europe
it
was
in
germany
and
german
switzerland
that
this
superstition
took
strongest
hold
that
same
depth
of
religious
feeling
which
produced
in
those
countries
the
most
terrible
growth
of
witchcraft
persecution
brought
superstition
to
its
highest
development
regarding
comets
no
country
suffered
more
from
it
in
the
middle
ages
at
the
reformation
luther
declared
strongly
in
favour
of
it
in
one
of
his
advent
sermons
he
said
the
heathen
write
that
the
comet
may
arise
from
natural
causes
but
god
creates
not
one
that
does
not
foretoken
a
sure
calamity
again
he
said
whatever
moves
in
the
heaven
in
an
unusual
way
is
certainly
a
sign
of
god
wrath
and
sometimes
yielding
to
another
phase
of
his
belief

declared
them
works
of

theological
efforts
to
crush
the
scientific
view
out
of
this
belief
was
developed
a
great
series
of
efforts
to
maintain
the
theological
view
of
comets
and
to
put
down
forever
the
scientific
view
these
efforts
may
be
divided
into
two
classes
those
directed
toward
learned
men
and
scholars
through
the
universities
and
those
directed
toward
the
people
at
large
through
the
pulpits
as
to
the
first
of
these
that
learned
men
and
scholars
might
be
kept
in
the
paths
of
sacred
science
and
sound
learning
especial
pains
was
taken
to
keep
all
knowledge
of
the
scientific
view
of
comets
as
far
as
possible
from
students
in
the
universities
even
to
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
oath
generally
required
of
professors
of
astronomy
over
a
large
part
of
europe
prevented
their
teaching
that
comets
are
heavenly
bodies
obedient
to
law
efforts
just
as
earnest
were
made
to
fasten
into
students
minds
the
theological
theory
two
or
three
examples
out
of
many
may
serve
as
types
first
of
these
may
be
named
the
teaching
of
jacob
heerbrand
professor
at
the
university
of
tubingen
who
in
illustrated
the
moral
value
of
comets
by
comparing
the
almighty
sending
a
comet
to
the
judge
laying
the
executioner
sword
on
the
table
between
himself
and
the
criminal
in
a
court
of
justice
and
again
to
the
father
or
schoolmaster
displaying
the
rod
before
naughty
children
a
little
later
we
have
another
churchman
of
great
importance
in
that
region
schickhart
head
pastor
and
superintendent
at
goppingen
preaching
and
publishing
a
comet
sermon
in
which
he
denounces
those
who
stare
at
such
warnings
of
god
without
heeding
them
and
compares
them
to
calves
gaping
at
a
new
barn
door
still
later
at
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
we
find
conrad
dieterich
director
of
studies
at
the
university
of
marburg
denouncing
all
scientific
investigation
of
comets
as
impious
and
insisting
that
they
are
only
to
be
regarded
as
signs
and
wonders

the
effect
of
the

see
his

described
more
fully
below
the
results
of
this
ecclesiastical
pressure
upon
science
in
the
universities
were
painfully
shown
during
generation
after
generation
as
regards
both
professors
and
students
and
examples
may
be
given
typical
of
its
effects
upon
each
of
these
two
classes
the
first
of
these
is
the
case
of
michael
maestlin
he
was
by
birth
a
swabian
protestant
was
educated
at
tubingen
as
a
pupil
of
apian
and
after
a
period
of
travel
was
settled
as
deacon
in
the
little
parish
of
backnang
when
the
comet
of
gave
him
an
occasion
to
apply
his
astronomical
studies
his
minute
and
accurate
observation
of
it
is
to
this
day
one
of
the
wonders
of
science
it
seems
almost
impossible
that
so
much
could
be
accomplished
by
the
naked
eye
his
observations
agreed
with
those
of
tycho
brahe
and
won
for
maestlin
the
professorship
of
astronomy
in
the
university
of
heidelberg
no
man
had
so
clearly
proved
the
supralunar
position
of
a
comet
or
shown
so
conclusively
that
its
motion
was
not
erratic
but
regular
the
young
astronomer
though
apian
pupil
was
an
avowed
copernican
and
the
destined
master
and
friend
of
kepler
yet
in
the
treatise
embodying
his
observations
he
felt
it
necessary
to
save
his
reputation
for
orthodoxy
by
calling
the
comet
a
new
and
horrible
prodigy
and
by
giving
a
chapter
of
conjectures
on
the
signification
of
the
present
comet
in
which
he
proves
from
history
that
this
variety
of
comet
betokens
peace
but
peace
purchased
by
a
bloody
victory
that
he
really
believed
in
this
theological
theory
seems
impossible
the
very
fact
that
his
observations
had
settled
the
supralunar
character
and
regular
motion
of
comets
proves
this
it
was
a
humiliation
only
to
be
compared
to
that
of
osiander
when
he
wrote
his
grovelling
preface
to
the
great
book
of
copernicus
maestlin
had
his
reward
when
a
few
years
later
his
old
teacher
apian
was
driven
from
his
chair
at
tubingen
for
refusing
to
sign
the
lutheran
maestlin
was
elected
to
his
place
not
less
striking
was
the
effect
of
this
theological
pressure
upon
the
minds
of
students
noteworthy
as
an
example
of
this
is
the
book
of
the
leipsic
lawyer
buttner
from
no
less
than
biblical
texts
he
proves
the
almighty
purpose
of
using
the
heavenly
bodies
for
the
instruction
of
men
as
to
future
events
and
then
proceeds
to
frame
exhaustive
tables
from
which
the
time
and
place
of
the
comet
first
appearance
being
known
its
signification
can
be
deduced
this
manual
he
gave
forth
as
a
triumph
of
religious
science
under
the
name
of
the
comet
for
maestlin
see
his
observatio
et
demonstration
cometae
tubingen
for
buttner
see
his
cometen
stundbuchlein
leipsic
the
same
devotion
to
the
portent
theory
is
found
in
the
universities
of
protestant
holland
striking
is
it
to
see
in
the
sixteenth
century
after
tycho
brahe
discovery
the
dutch
theologian
gerard
vossius
professor
of
theology
and
eloquence
at
leyden
lending
his
great
weight
to
the
superstition
the
history
of
all
times
he
says
shows
comets
to
be
the
messengers
of
misfortune
it
does
not
follow
that
they
are
endowed
with
intelligence
but
that
there
is
a
deity
who
makes
use
of
them
to
call
the
human
race
to
repentance
though
familiar
with
the
works
of
tycho
brahe
he
finds
it
hard
to
believe
that
all
comets
are
ethereal
and
adduces
several
historical
examples
of
sublunary
ones
nor
was
this
attempt
to
hold
back
university
teaching
to
the
old
view
of
comets
confined
to
protestants
the
roman
church
was
if
possible
more
strenuous
in
the
same
effort
a
few
examples
will
serve
as
types
representing
the
orthodox
teaching
at
the
great
centres
of
catholic
theology
one
of
these
is
seen
in
spain
the
eminent
jurist
torreblanca
was
recognised
as
a
controlling
authority
in
all
the
universities
of
spain
and
from
these
he
swayed
in
the
seventeenth
century
the
thought
of
catholic
europe
especially
as
to
witchcraft
and
the
occult
powers
in
nature
he
lays
down
the
old
cometary
superstition
as
one
of
the
foundations
of
orthodox
teaching
begging
the
question
after
the
fashion
of
his
time
he
argues
that
comets
can
not
be
stars
because
new
stars
always
betoken
good
while
comets
betoken
evil
the
same
teaching
was
given
in
the
catholic
universities
of
the
netherlands
fromundus
at
louvain
the
enemy
of
galileo
steadily
continued
his
crusade
against
all
cometary
heresy
for
vossius
see
the
de
idololatria
in
his
opera
vol
v
pp
for
torreblanc
see
his
de
magia
seville
and
often
reprinted
for
fromundus
see
his
meteorologica
but
a
still
more
striking
case
is
seen
in
italy
the
reverend
father
augustin
de
angelis
rector
of
the
clementine
college
at
rome
as
late
as
after
the
new
cometary
theory
had
been
placed
beyond
reasonable
doubt
and
even
while
newton
was
working
out
its
final
demonstration
published
a
third
edition
of
his
lectures
on
meteorology
it
was
dedicated
to
the
cardinal
of
hesse
and
bore
the
express
sanction
of
the
master
of
the
sacred
palace
at
rome
and
of
the
head
of
the
religious
order
to
which
de
angelis
belonged
this
work
deserves
careful
analysis
not
only
as
representing
the
highest
and
most
approved
university
teaching
of
the
time
at
the
centre
of
roman
catholic
christendom
but
still
more
because
it
represents
that
attempt
to
make
a
compromise
between
theology
and
science
or
rather
the
attempt
to
confiscate
science
to
the
uses
of
theology
which
we
so
constantly
find
whenever
the
triumph
of
science
in
any
field
has
become
inevitable
as
to
the
scientific
element
in
this
compromise
de
angelis
holds
in
his
general
introduction
regarding
meteorology
that
the
main
material
cause
of
comets
is
exhalation
and
says
if
this
exhalation
is
thick
and
sticky
it
blazes
into
a
comet
and
again
he
returns
to
the
same
view
saying
that
one
form
of
exhalation
is
dense
hence
easily
inflammable
and
long
retentive
of
fire
from
which
sort
are
especially
generated
comets
but
it
is
in
his
third
lecture
that
he
takes
up
comets
specially
and
his
discussion
of
them
is
extended
through
the
fourth
fifth
and
sixth
lectures
having
given
in
detail
the
opinions
of
various
theologians
and
philosophers
he
declares
his
own
in
the
form
of
two
conclusions
the
first
of
these
is
that
comets
are
not
heavenly
bodies
but
originate
in
the
earth
atmosphere
below
the
moon
for
everything
heavenly
is
eternal
and
incorruptible
but
comets
have
a
beginning
and
ending
ergo
comets
can
not
be
heavenly
bodies
this
we
may
observe
is
levelled
at
the
observations
and
reasonings
of
tycho
brahe
and
kepler
and
is
a
very
good
illustration
of
the
scholastic
and
mediaeval
method
the
method
which
blots
out
an
ascertained
fact
by
means
of
a
metaphysical
formula
his
second
conclusion
is
that
comets
are
of
elemental
and
sublunary
nature
for
they
are
an
exhalation
hot
and
dry
fatty
and
well
condensed
inflammable
and
kindled
in
the
uppermost
regions
of
the
air
he
then
goes
on
to
answer
sundry
objections
to
this
mixture
of
metaphysics
and
science
and
among
other
things
declares
that
the
fatty
sticky
material
of
a
comet
may
be
kindled
from
sparks
falling
from
fiery
heavenly
bodies
or
from
a
thunderbolt
and
again
that
the
thick
fatty
sticky
quality
of
the
comet
holds
its
tail
in
shape
and
that
so
far
are
comets
from
having
their
paths
beyond
the
moon
orbit
as
tycho
brahe
and
kepler
thought
he
himself
in
saw
a
bearded
comet
so
near
the
summit
of
vesuvius
that
it
almost
seemed
to
touch
it
as
to
sorts
and
qualities
of
comets
he
accepts
aristotle
view
and
divides
them
into
bearded
and
tailed
he
goes
on
into
long
disquisitions
upon
their
colours
forms
and
motions
under
this
latter
head
he
again
plunges
deep
into
a
sea
of
metaphysical
considerations
and
does
not
reappear
until
he
brings
up
his
compromise
in
the
opinion
that
their
movement
is
as
yet
uncertain
and
not
understood
but
that
if
we
must
account
definitely
for
it
we
must
say
that
it
is
effected
by
angels
especially
assigned
to
this
service
by
divine
providence
but
while
proposing
this
compromise
between
science
and
theology
as
to
the
origin
and
movement
of
comets
he
will
hear
to
none
as
regards
their
mission
as
signs
and
wonders
and
presages
of
evil
he
draws
up
a
careful
table
of
these
evils
arranging
them
in
the
following
order
drought
wind
earthquake
tempest
famine
pestilence
war
and
to
clinch
the
matter
declares
that
the
comet
observed
by
him
in
brought
not
only
war
famine
pestilence
and
earthquake
but
also
a
general
volcanic
eruption
which
would
have
destroyed
naples
had
not
the
blood
of
the
invincible
martyr
januarius
withstood
it
barbata
et
caudata
it
will
be
observed
even
from
this
sketch
that
while
the
learned
father
augustin
thus
comes
infallibly
to
the
mediaeval
conclusion
he
does
so
very
largely
by
scientific
and
essentially
modern
processes
giving
unwonted
prominence
to
observation
and
at
times
twisting
scientific
observation
into
the
strand
with
his
metaphysics
the
observations
and
methods
of
his
science
are
sometimes
shrewd
sometimes
comical
good
examples
of
the
latter
sort
are
such
as
his
observing
that
the
comet
stood
very
near
the
summit
of
vesuvius
and
his
reasoning
that
its
tail
was
kept
in
place
by
its
stickiness
but
observations
and
reasonings
of
this
sort
are
always
the
first
homage
paid
by
theology
to
science
as
the
end
of
their
struggle
approaches

de
angelis

rome
equally
striking
is
an
example
seen
a
little
later
in
another
part
of
europe
and
it
is
the
more
noteworthy
because
halley
and
newton
had
already
fully
established
the
modern
scientific
theory
just
at
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
jesuit
reinzer
professor
at
linz
put
forth
his
meteorologia
in
which
all
natural
phenomena
received
both
a
physical
and
a
moral
interpretation
it
was
profusely
and
elaborately
illustrated
and
on
account
of
its
instructive
contents
was
in
translated
into
german
for
the
unlearned
reader
the
comet
receives
of
course
great
attention
it
appears
says
reinzer
only
then
in
the
heavens
when
the
latter
punish
the
earth
and
through
it
the
comet
not
only
predict
but
bring
to
pass
all
sorts
of
calamity
and
to
that
end
its
tail
serves
for
a
rod
its
hair
for
weapons
and
arrows
its
light
for
a
threat
and
its
heat
for
a
sign
of
anger
and
vengeance
its
warnings
are
threefold
comets
generated
in
the
air
betoken
naturally
drought
wind
earthquake
famine
and
pestilence
comets
can
indirectly
in
view
of
their
material
betoken
wars
tumults
and
the
death
of
princes
for
being
hot
and
dry
they
bring
the
moistnesses
feuchtigkeiten
in
the
human
body
to
an
extraordinary
heat
and
dryness
increasing
the
gall
and
since
the
emotions
depend
on
the
temperament
and
condition
of
the
body
men
are
through
this
change
driven
to
violent
deeds
quarrels
disputes
and
finally
to
arms
especially
is
this
the
result
with
princes
who
are
more
delicate
and
also
more
arrogant
than
other
men
and
whose
moistnesses
are
more
liable
to
inflammation
of
this
sort
inasmuch
as
they
live
in
luxury
and
seldom
restrain
themselves
from
those
things
which
in
such
a
dry
state
of
the
heavens
are
especially
injurious
all
comets
whatever
prophetic
significance
they
may
have
naturally
in
and
of
themselves
are
yet
principally
according
to
the
divine
pleasure
heralds
of
the
death
of
great
princes
of
war
and
of
other
such
great
calamities
and
this
is
known
and
proved
first
of
all
from
the
words
of
christ
himself
shall
rise
against
nation
and
kingdom
against
kingdom
and
great
earthquakes
shall
be
in
divers
places
and
famines
and
pestilences
and
fearful
sights
and
great
signs
shall
there
be

while
such
pains
was
taken
to
keep
the
more
highly
educated
classes
in
the
paths
of
scriptural
science
and
sound
learning
at
the
universities
equal
efforts
were
made
to
preserve
the
cometary
orthodoxy
of
the
people
at
large
by
means
of
the
pulpits
out
of
the
mass
of
sermons
for
this
purpose
which
were
widely
circulated
i
will
select
just
two
as
typical
and
they
are
worthy
of
careful
study
as
showing
some
special
dangers
of
applying
theological
methods
to
scientific
facts
in
the
second
half
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
recognised
capital
of
orthodox
lutheranism
was
magdeburg
and
in
the
region
tributary
to
this
metropolis
no
church
official
held
a
more
prominent
station
than
the
superintendent
or
lutheran
bishop
of
the
neighbouring
altmark
it
was
this
dignitary
andreas
celichius
by
name
who
at
magdeburg
in
gave
to
the
press
his
theological
reminder
of
the
new
comet
after
deprecating
as
blasphemous
the
attempt
of
aristotle
to
explain
the
phenomenon
otherwise
than
as
a
supernatural
warning
from
god
to
sinful
man
he
assures
his
hearers
that
whoever
would
know
the
comet
real
source
and
nature
must
not
merely
gape
and
stare
at
the
scientific
theory
that
it
is
an
earthy
greasy
tough
and
sticky
vapour
and
mist
rising
into
the
upper
air
and
set
ablaze
by
the
celestial
heat
far
more
important
for
them
is
it
to
know
what
this
vapour
is
it
is
really
in
the
opinion
of
celichius
nothing
more
or
less
than
the
thick
smoke
of
human
sins
rising
every
day
every
hour
every
moment
full
of
stench
and
horror
before
the
face
of
god
and
becoming
gradually
so
thick
as
to
form
a
comet
with
curled
and
plaited
tresses
which
at
last
is
kindled
by
the
hot
and
fiery
anger
of
the
supreme
heavenly
judge
he
adds
that
it
is
probably
only
through
the
prayers
and
tears
of
christ
that
this
blazing
monument
of
human
depravity
becomes
visible
to
mortals
in
support
of
this
theory
he
urges
the
coming
up
before
god
of
the
wickedness
of
sodom
and
gomorrah
and
of
nineveh
and
especially
the
words
of
the
prophet
regarding
babylon
her
stench
and
rottenness
is
come
up
before
me
that
the
anger
of
god
can
produce
the
conflagration
without
any
intervention
of
nature
is
proved
from
the
psalms
he
sendeth
out
his
word
and
melteth
them
from
the
position
of
the
comet
its
course
and
the
direction
of
its
tail
he
augurs
especially
the
near
approach
of
the
judgment
day
though
it
may
also
betoken
as
usual
famine
pestilence
and
war
yet
even
in
these
days
he
mourns
there
are
people
reckless
and
giddy
enough
to
pay
no
heed
to
such
celestial
warnings
and
these
even
cite
in
their
own
defence
the
injunction
of
jeremiah
not
to
fear
signs
in
the
heavens
this
idea
he
explodes
and
shows
that
good
and
orthodox
christians
while
not
superstitious
like
the
heathen
know
well
that
god
is
not
bound
to
his
creation
and
the
ordinary
course
of
nature
but
must
often
especially
in
these
last
dregs
of
the
world
resort
to
irregular
means
to
display
his
anger
at
human
guilt
for
celichius
or
celich
see
his
own
treatise
as
above
the
other
typical
case
occurred
in
the
following
century
and
in
another
part
of
germany
conrad
dieterich
was
during
the
first
half
of
the
seventeenth
century
a
lutheran
ecclesiastic
of
the
highest
authority
his
ability
as
a
theologian
had
made
him
archdeacon
of
marburg
professor
of
philosophy
and
director
of
studies
at
the
university
of
giessen
and
superintendent
or
lutheran
bishop
in
southwestern
germany
in
the
year
on
the
second
sunday
in
advent
in
the
great
cathedral
of
ulm
he
developed
the
orthodox
doctrine
of
comets
in
a
sermon
taking
up
the
questions
what
are
comets
what
do
they
indicate
what
have
we
to
do
with
their
significance
this
sermon
marks
an
epoch
delivered
in
that
stronghold
of
german
protestantism
and
by
a
prelate
of
the
highest
standing
it
was
immediately
printed
prefaced
by
three
laudatory
poems
from
different
men
of
note
and
sent
forth
to
drive
back
the
scientific
or
as
it
was
called
the
godless
view
of
comets
the
preface
shows
that
dieterich
was
sincerely
alarmed
by
the
tendency
to
regard
comets
as
natural
appearances
his
text
was
taken
from
the
verse
of
the
chapter
of
luke
and
there
shall
be
signs
in
the
sun
and
in
the
moon
and
in
the
stars
and
upon
the
earth
distress
of
nations
with
perplexity
the
sea
and
the
waves
roaring
as
to
what
comets
are
he
cites
a
multitude
of
philosophers
and
finding
that
they
differ
among
themselves
he
uses
a
form
of
argument
not
uncommon
from
that
day
to
this
declaring
that
this
difference
of
opinion
proves
that
there
is
no
solution
of
the
problem
save
in
revelation
and
insisting
that
comets
are
signs
especially
sent
by
the
almighty
to
warn
the
earth
an
additional
proof
of
this
he
finds
in
the
forms
of
comets
one
he
says
took
the
form
of
a
trumpet
another
of
a
spear
another
of
a
goat
another
of
a
torch
another
of
a
sword
another
of
an
arrow
another
of
a
sabre
still
another
of
a
bare
arm
from
these
forms
of
comets
he
infers
that
we
may
divine
their
purpose
as
to
their
creation
he
quotes
john
of
damascus
and
other
early
church
authorities
in
behalf
of
the
idea
that
each
comet
is
a
star
newly
created
at
the
divine
command
out
of
nothing
and
that
it
indicates
the
wrath
of
god
as
to
their
purpose
having
quoted
largely
from
the
bible
and
from
luther
he
winds
up
by
insisting
that
as
god
can
make
nothing
in
vain
comets
must
have
some
distinct
object
then
from
isaiah
and
joel
among
the
prophets
from
matthew
mark
and
luke
among
the
evangelists
from
origen
and
john
chrysostom
among
the
fathers
from
luther
and
melanchthon
among
the
reformers
he
draws
various
texts
more
or
less
conclusive
to
prove
that
comets
indicate
evil
and
only
evil
and
he
cites
luther
advent
sermon
to
the
effect
that
though
comets
may
arise
in
the
course
of
nature
they
are
still
signs
of
evil
to
mankind
in
answer
to
the
theory
of
sundry
naturalists
that
comets
are
made
up
of
a
certain
fiery
warm
sulphurous
saltpetery
sticky
fog
he
declaims
our
sins
our
sins
they
are
the
fiery
heated
vapours
the
thick
sticky
sulphurous
clouds
which
rise
from
the
earth
toward
heaven
before
god
throughout
the
sermon
dieterich
pours
contempt
over
all
men
who
simply
investigate
comets
as
natural
objects
calls
special
attention
to
a
comet
then
in
the
heavens
resembling
a
long
broom
or
bundle
of
rods
and
declares
that
he
and
his
hearers
can
only
consider
it
rightly
when
we
see
standing
before
us
our
lord
god
in
heaven
as
an
angry
father
with
a
rod
for
his
children
in
answer
to
the
question
what
comets
signify
he
commits
himself
entirely
to
the
idea
that
they
indicate
the
wrath
of
god
and
therefore
calamities
of
every
sort
page
after
page
is
filled
with
the
records
of
evils
following
comets
beginning
with
the
creation
of
the
world
he
insists
that
the
first
comet
brought
on
the
deluge
of
noah
and
cites
a
mass
of
authorities
ranging
from
moses
and
isaiah
to
albert
the
great
and
melanchthon
in
support
of
the
view
that
comets
precede
earthquakes
famines
wars
pestilences
and
every
form
of
evil
he
makes
some
parade
of
astronomical
knowledge
as
to
the
greatness
of
the
sun
and
moon
but
relapses
soon
into
his
old
line
of
argument
imploring
his
audience
not
to
be
led
away
from
the
belief
of
christendom
and
the
principles
of
their
fathers
he
comes
back
to
his
old
assertion
insists
that
our
sins
are
the
inflammable
material
of
which
comets
are
made
and
winds
up
with
a
most
earnest
appeal
to
the
almighty
to
spare
his
people

from

showing
the
connection
of
the
eleventh
and
twelfth
verses
of

chapter
of
jeremiah
with
the
comet
giving
notice
that
at
his
suggestion
the
authorities
had
proclaimed
a
solemn
fast
and
exhorting
the
clergy
to
preach
earnestly
on
the
subject
of
this

it
can
be
easily
understood
that
such
authoritative
utterances
as
that
of
dieterich
must
have
produced
a
great
effect
throughout
protestant
christendom
and
in
due
time
we
see
their
working
in
new
england
that
same
tendency
to
provincialism
which
save
at
rare
intervals
has
been
the
bane
of
massachusetts
thought
from
that
day
to
this
appeared
and
in
we
find
samuel
danforth
arguing
from
the
bible
that
comets
are
portentous
signals
of
great
and
notable
changes
and
arguing
from
history
that
they
have
been
many
times
heralds
of
wrath
to
a
secure
and
impenitent
world
he
cites
especially
the
comet
of
which
appeared
just
before
cotton
sickness
and
disappeared
after
his
death
morton
also
in
his
memorial
recording
the
death
of
john
putnam
alludes
to
the
comet
of
as
a
very
signal
testimony
that
god
had
then
removed
a
bright
star
and
a
shining
light
out
of
the
heaven
of
his
church
here
into
celestial
glory
above
again
he
speaks
of
another
comet
insisting
that
it
was
no
fiery
meteor
caused
by
exhalation
but
it
was
sent
immediately
by
god
to
awaken
the
secure
world
and
goes
on
to
show
how
in
that
year
it
pleased
god
to
smite
the
fruits
of
the
earth
namely
the
wheat
in
special
with
blasting
and
mildew
whereby
much
of
it
was
spoiled
and
became
profitable
for
nothing
and
much
of
it
worth
little
being
light
and
empty
this
was
looked
upon
by
the
judicious
and
conscientious
of
the
land
as
a
speaking
providence
against
the
unthankfulness
of
many
as
also
against
voluptuousness
and
abuse
of
the
good
creatures
of
god
by
licentiousness
in
drinking
and
fashions
in
apparel
for
the
obtaining
whereof
a
great
part
of
the
principal
grain
was
oftentimes
unnecessarily
expended
but
in
a
stronger
than
either
of
these
seized
upon
the
doctrine
and
wielded
it
with
power
increase
mather
so
open
always
to
ideas
from
europe
and
always
so
powerful
for
good
or
evil
in
the
cloonies
preached
his
sermon
on
heaven
alarm
to
the
world
wherein
is
shown
that
fearful
sights
and
signs
in
the
heavens
are
the
presages
of
great
calamities
at
hand
the
texts
were
taken
from
the
book
of
revelation
and
the
third
angel
sounded
and
there
fell
a
great
star
from
heaven
burning
as
it
were
a
lamp
and
behold
the
third
woe
cometh
quickly
in
this
as
in
various
other
sermons
he
supports
the
theological
cometary
theory
fully
he
insists
that
we
are
fallen
into
the
dregs
of
time
and
that
the
day
of
judgment
is
evidently
approaching
he
explains
away
the
words
of
jeremiah
be
not
dismayed
at
signs
in
the
heavens
and
shows
that
comets
have
been
forerunners
of
nearly
every
form
of
evil
having
done
full
justice
to
evils
thus
presaged
in
scriptural
times
he
begins
a
similar
display
in
modern
history
by
citing
blazing
stars
which
foretold
the
invasions
of
goths
huns
saracens
and
turks
and
warns
gainsayers
by
citing
the
example
of
vespasian
who
after
ridiculing
a
comet
soon
died
the
general
shape
and
appearance
of
comets
he
thinks
betoken
their
purpose
and
he
cites
tertullian
to
prove
them
god
sharp
razors
on
mankind
whereby
he
doth
poll
and
his
scythe
whereby
he
doth
shear
down
multitudes
of
sinful
creatures
at
last
rising
to
a
fearful
height
he
declares
for
the
lord
hath
fired
his
beacon
in
the
heavens
among
the
stars
of
god
there
the
fearful
sight
is
not
yet
out
of
sight
the
warning
piece
of
heaven
is
going
off
now
then
if
the
lord
discharge
his
murdering
pieces
from
on
high
and
men
be
found
in
their
sins
unfit
for
death
their
blood
shall
be
upon
them
and
again
in
an
agony
of
supplication
he
cries
out
do
we
see
the
sword
blazing
over
us
let
it
put
us
upon
crying
to
god
that
the
judgment
be
diverted
and
not
return
upon
us
again
so
speedily
doth
god
threaten
our
very
heavens

pray
unto
him

he
would
not

and

two
years
later
in
august
he
followed
this
with
another
sermon
on
the
latter
sign
wherein
is
showed
that
the
voice
of
god
in
signal
providences
especially
when
repeated
and
iterated
ought
to
be
hearkened
unto
here
too
of
course
the
comet
comes
in
for
a
large
share
of
attention
but
his
tone
is
less
sure
even
in
the
midst
of
all
his
arguments
appears
an
evident
misgiving
the
thoughts
of
newton
in
science
and
bayle
in
philosophy
were
evidently
tending
to
accomplish
the
prophecy
of
seneca
mather
alarm
at
this
is
clear
his
natural
tendency
is
to
uphold
the
idea
that
a
comet
is
simply
a
flung
from
the
hand
of
an
avenging
god
at
a
guilty
world
but
he
evidently
feels
obliged
to
yield
something
to
the
scientific
spirit
hence
in
the
discourse
concerning
comets
published
in
he
declares
there
are
those
who
think
that
inasmuch
as
comets
may
be
supposed
to
proceed
from
natural
causes
there
is
no
speaking
voice
of
heaven
in
them
beyond
what
is
to
be
said
of
all
other
works
of
god
but
certain
it
is
that
many
things
which
may
happen
according
to
the
course
of
nature
are
portentous
signs
of
divine
anger
and
prognostics
of
great
evils
hastening
upon
the
world
he
then
notices
the
eclipse
of
august
and
adds
that
year
the
college
was
eclipsed
by
the
death
of
the
learned
president
there
worthy
chauncey
and
two
colonies
namely
massachusetts
and
plymouth
by
the
death
of
two
governors
who
died
within
a
twelvemonth
after
shall
then
such
mighty
works
of
god
as
comets
are
be
insignificant

increase

printed
at

the
invasion
of
scepticism
vigorous
as
mather
argument
is
we
see
scepticism
regarding
signs
continuing
to
invade
the
public
mind
and
in
spite
of
his
threatenings
about
twenty
years
after
we
find
a
remarkable
evidence
of
this
progress
in
the
fact
that
this
scepticism
has
seized
upon
no
less
a
personage
than
that
colossus
of
orthodoxy
his
thrice
illustrious
son
cotton
mather
himself
and
him
we
find
in
despite
the
arguments
of
his
father
declaring
in
his
manuductio
perhaps
there
may
be
some
need
for
me
to
caution
you
against
being
dismayed
at
the
signs
of
the
heavens
or
having
any
superstitious
fancies
upon
eclipses
and
the
like
i
am
willing
that
you
be
apprehensive
of
nothing
portentous
in
blazing
stars
for
my
part
i
know
not
whether
all
our
worlds
and
even
the
sun
itself
may
not
fare
the
better
for
them
for
cotton
mather
see
the
manuductio
pp
curiously
enough
for
this
scientific
scepticism
in
cotton
mather
there
was
a
cause
identical
with
that
which
had
developed
superstition
in
the
mind
of
his
father
the
same
provincial
tendency
to
receive
implicitly
any
new
european
fashion
in
thinking
or
speech
wrought
upon
both
plunging
one
into
superstition
and
drawing
the
other
out
of
it
european
thought
which
new
england
followed
had
at
last
broken
away
in
great
measure
from
the
theological
view
of
comets
as
signs
and
wonders
the
germ
of
this
emancipating
influence
was
mainly
in
the
great
utterance
of
seneca
and
we
find
in
nearly
every
century
some
evidence
that
this
germ
was
still
alive
this
life
became
more
and
more
evident
after
the
reformation
period
even
though
theologians
in
every
church
did
their
best
to
destroy
it
the
first
series
of
attacks
on
the
old
theological
doctrine
were
mainly
founded
in
philosophic
reasoning
as
early
as
the
first
half
of
the
sixteenth
century
we
hear
julius
caesar
scaliger
protesting
against
the
cometary
superstition
as
ridiculous
folly
of
more
real
importance
was
the
treatise
of
blaise
de
vigenere
published
at
paris
in
in
this
little
book
various
statements
regarding
comets
as
signs
of
wrath
or
causes
of
evils
are
given
and
then
followed
by
a
very
gentle
and
quiet
discussion
usually
tending
to
develop
that
healthful
scepticism
which
is
the
parent
of
investigation
a
fair
example
of
his
mode
of
treating
the
subject
is
seen
in
his
dealing
with
a
bit
of
sacred
science
this
was
simply
that
comets
menace
princes
and
kings
with
death
because
they
live
more
delicately
than
other
people
and
therefore
the
air
thickened
and
corrupted
by
a
comet
would
be
naturally
more
injurious
to
them
than
to
common
folk
who
live
on
coarser
food
to
this
de
vigenere
answers
that
there
are
very
many
persons
who
live
on
food
as
delicate
as
that
enjoyed
by
princes
and
kings
and
yet
receive
no
harm
from
comets
he
then
goes
on
to
show
that
many
of
the
greatest
monarchs
in
history
have
met
death
without
any
comet
to
herald
it
for
scaliger
see
of
dudith
book
cited
below
in
the
same
year
thoughtful
scepticism
of
a
similar
sort
found
an
advocate
in
another
part
of
europe
thomas
erastus
the
learned
and
devout
professor
of
medicine
at
heidelberg
put
forth
a
letter
dealing
in
the
plainest
terms
with
the
superstition
he
argued
especially
that
there
could
be
no
natural
connection
between
the
comet
and
pestilence
since
the
burning
of
an
exhalation
must
tend
to
purify
rather
than
to
infect
the
air
in
the
following
year
the
eloquent
hungarian
divine
dudith
published
a
letter
in
which
the
theological
theory
was
handled
even
more
shrewdly
for
he
argued
that
if
comets
were
caused
by
the
sins
of
mortals
they
would
never
be
absent
from
the
sky
but
these
utterances
were
for
the
time
brushed
aside
by
the
theological
leaders
of
thought
as
shallow
or
impious
in
the
seventeenth
century
able
arguments
against
the
superstition
on
general
grounds
began
to
be
multiplied
in
holland
balthasar
bekker
opposed
this
as
he
opposed
the
witchcraft
delusion
on
general
philosophic
grounds
and
lubienitzky
wrote
in
a
compromising
spirit
to
prove
that
comets
were
as
often
followed

good
as
by
evil
events

a
vehement
protest
against
the
superstition
basing
his
arguments
not
on
astronomy
but
on
common
sense
a
very
effective
part
of
the
little
treatise
was
devoted
to
answering
the
authority
of
the
fathers
of
the
early
church
to
do
this
he
simply
reminded
his
readers
that
augustine
and
john
damascenus
had
also
opposed
the
doctrine
of
the

yet
none

did
they
set

at
thinking
and
prepare
the
way
for
a
far
greater
genius
for
toward
the
end
of
the
same
century
the
philosophic
attack
was
taken
up
by
pierre
bayle
and
in
the
whole
series
of
philosophic
champions
he
is
chief
while
professor
at
the
university
of
sedan
he
had
observed
the
alarm
caused
by
the
comet
of
and
he
now
brought
all
his
reasoning
powers
to
bear
upon
it
thoughts
deep
and
witty
he
poured
out
in
volume
after
volume
catholics
and
protestants
were
alike
scandalized
catholic
france
spurned
him
and
jurieu
the
great
reformed
divine
called
his
cometary
views
atheism
and
tried
hard
to
have
protestant
holland
condemn
him
though
bayle
did
not
touch
immediately
the
mass
of
mankind
he
wrought
with
power
upon
men
who
gave
themselves
the
trouble
of
thinking
it
was
indeed
unfortunate
for
the
church
that
theologians
instead
of
taking
the
initiative
in
this
matter
left
it
to
bayle
for
in
tearing
down
the
pretended
scriptural
doctrine
of
comets
he
tore
down
much
else
of
all
men
in
his
time
no
one
so
thoroughly
prepared
the
way
for
voltaire
bayle
whole
argument
is
rooted
in
the
prophecy
of
seneca
he
declares
comets
are
bodies
subject
to
the
ordinary
law
of
nature
and
not
prodigies
amenable
to
no
law
he
shows
historically
that
there
is
no
reason
to
regard
comets
as
portents
of
earthly
evils
as
to
the
fact
that
such
evils
occur
after
the
passage
of
comets
across
the
sky
he
compares
the
person
believing
that
comets
cause
these
evils
to
a
woman
looking
out
of
a
window
into
a
paris
street
and
believing
that
the
carriages
pass
because
she
looks
out
as
to
the
accomplishment
of
some
predictions
he
cites
the
shrewd
saying
of
henry
iv
to
the
effect
that
the
public
will
remember
one
prediction
that
comes
true
better
than
all
the
rest
that
have
proved
false
finally
he
sums
up
by
saying
the
more
we
study
man
the
more
does
it
appear
that
pride
is
his
ruling
passion
and
that
he
affects
grandeur
even
in
his
misery
mean
and
perishable
creature
that
he
is
he
has
been
able
to
persuade
men
that
he
can
not
die
without
disturbing
the
whole
course
of
nature
and
obliging
the
heavens
to
put
themselves
to
fresh
expense
in
order
to
light
his
funeral
pomp
foolish
and
ridiculous
vanity
if
we
had
a
just
idea
of
the
universe
we
should
soon
comprehend
that
the
death
or
birth
of
a
prince
is
too
insignificant

matter

stir

heavens

a
point
of
capital
importance
in
france
was
made
by
rendering
the
army
of
ignorance
ridiculous
see
fontenelle
cited
by

such
was
the
line
of
philosophic
and
literary
attack
as
developed
from
scaliger
to
fontenelle
but
beneath

in
the
midst

of
it
from

giving
firmness

and

sources
of
vitality

it

steady
development
of
scientific
effort
and
to

series
of
great
men
who
patiently
wrought
and
thought
out
the
truth
by
scientific
methods
through
all
these
centuries
belong
the
honours
of
the
victory
for
generations
men
in
various
parts
of
the
world
had
been
making
careful
observations
on
these
strange
bodies
as
far
back
as
the
time
when
luther
and
melanchthon
and
zwingli
were
plunged
into
alarm
by
various
comets
from
to
peter
apian
kept
his
head
sufficiently
cool
to
make
scientific
notes
of
their
paths
through
the
heavens
a
little
later
when
the
great
comet
of
scared
popes
emperors
and
reformers
alike
such
men
as
fabricius
at
vienna
and
heller
at
nuremberg
quietly
observed
its
path
in
vain
did
men
like
dieterich
and
heerbrand
and
celich
from
various
parts
of
germany
denounce
such
observations
and
investigations
as
impious
they
were
steadily
continued
and
in
came
the
first
which
led
to
the
distinct
foundation
of
the
modern
doctrine
in
that
year
appeared
a
comet
which
again
plunged
europe
into
alarm
in
every
european
country
this
alarm
was
strong
but
in
germany
strongest
of
all
the
churches
were
filled
with
multitudes
celich
preaching
at
magdeburg
was
echoed
by
heerbrand
preaching
at
tubingen
and
both
these
from
thousands
of
other
pulpits
catholic
and
protestant
throughout
europe
in
the
midst
of
all
this
din
and
outcry
a
few
men
quietly
but
steadily
observed
the
monster
and
tycho
brahe
announced
as
the
result
that
its
path
lay
farther
from
the
earth
than
the
orbit
of
the
moon
another
great
astronomical
genius
kepler
confirmed
this
this
distinct
beginning
of
the
new
doctrine
was
bitterly
opposed
by
theologians
they
denounced
it
as
one
of
the
evil
results
of
that
scientific
meddling
with
the
designs
of
providence
against
which
they
had
so
long
declaimed
in
pulpits
and
chairs
they
even
brought
forward
some
astronomers
ambitious
or
enough
to
testify
that
tycho
and
kepler
were
in
error

a
good

of
the
theologic
attitude
see
pingre
vol

nothing
could
be
more
natural
than
such
opposition
for
this
simple
announcement
by
tycho
brahe
began
a
new
era
it
shook
the
very
foundation
of
cometary
superstition
the
aristotelian
view
developed
by
the
theologians
was
that
what
lies
within
the
moon
orbit
appertains
to
the
earth
and
is
essentially
transitory
and
evil
while
what
lies
beyond
it
belongs
to
the
heavens
and
is
permanent
regular
and
pure
tycho
brahe
and
kepler
therefore
having
by
means
of
scientific
observation
and
thought
taken
comets
out
of
the
category
of
meteors
and
appearances
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
earth
and
placed
them
among
the
heavenly
bodies
dealt
a
blow
at
the
very
foundations
of
the
theological
argument
and
gave
a
great
impulse
to
the
idea
that
comets
are
themselves
heavenly
bodies
moving
regularly
and
in
obedience
to
law
iv
theological
efforts
at
the
final
victory
of
science
attempts
were
now
made
to
compromise
it
was
declared
that
while
some
comets
were
doubtless
supralunar
some
must
be
sublunar
but
this
admission
was
no
less
fatal
on
another
account
during
many
centuries
the
theory
favoured
by
the
church
had
been
as
we
have
seen
that
the
earth
was
surrounded
by
hollow
spheres
concentric
and
transparent
forming
a
number
of
glassy
strata
incasing
one
another
like
the
different
coatings
of
an
onion
and
that
each
of
these
in
its
movement
about
the
earth
carries
one
or
more
of
the
heavenly
bodies
some
maintained
that
these
spheres
were
crystal
but
lactantius
and
with
him
various
fathers
of
the
church
spoke
of
the
heavenly
vault
as
made
of
ice
now
the
admission
that
comets
could
move
beyond
the
moon
was
fatal
to
this
theory
for
it
sent
them
crashing
through
these
spheres
of
ice
or
crystal
and
therefore
through
the
whole
sacred
fabric
of
the
ptolemaic
theory
for
these
features
in
cometary
theory

here
we
may
pause
for
a
moment
to
note
one
of
the
chief
differences
between
scientific
and
theological
reasoning
considered
in
themselves
kepler
main
reasoning
as
to
the
existence
of
a
law
for
cometary
movement
was
right
but
his
secondary
reasoning
that
comets
move
nearly
in
straight
lines
was
wrong
his
right
reasoning
was
developed
by
gassendi
in
france
by
borelli
in
italy
by
hevel
and
doerfel
in
germany
by
eysat
and
bernouilli
in
switzerland
by
percy
and
most
important
of
all
as
regards
mathematical
demonstration
by
newton
in
england
the
general
theory
which
was
true
they
accepted
and
developed
the
secondary
theory
which
was
found
untrue
they
rejected
and
as
a
result
both
of
what
they
thus
accepted
and
of
what
they
rejected
was
evolved
the
basis
of
the
whole
modern
cometary
theory
very
different
was
this
from
the
theological
method
as
a
rule
when
there
arises
a
thinker
as
great
in
theology
as
kepler
in
science
the
whole
mass
of
his
conclusions
ripens
into
a
dogma
his
disciples
labour
not
to
test
it
but
to
establish
it
and
while
in
the
catholic
church
it
becomes
a
dogma
to
be
believed
or
disbelieved
under
the
penalty
of
damnation
it
becomes
in
the
protestant
church
the
basis
for
one
more
sect
various
astronomers
laboured
to
develop
the
truth
discovered
by
tycho
and
strengthened
by
kepler
cassini
seemed
likely
to
win
for
italy
the
glory
of
completing
the
great
structure
but
he
was
sadly
fettered
by
church
influences
and
was
obliged
to
leave
most
of
the
work
to
others
early
among
these
was
hevel
he
gave
reasons
for
believing
that
comets
move
in
parabolic
curves
toward
the
sun
then
came
a
man
who
developed
this
truth
further
samuel
doerfel
and
it
is
a
pleasure
to
note
that
he
was
a
clergyman
the
comet
of
which
set
erni
in
switzerland
mather
in
new
england
and
so
many
others
in
all
parts
of
the
world
at
declaiming
set
doerfel
at
thinking
undismayed
by
the
authority
of
origen
and
john
chrysostom
the
arguments
of
luther
melanchthon
and
zwingli
the
outcries
of
celich
heerbrand
and
dieterich
he
pondered
over
the
problem
in
his
little
saxon
parsonage
until
in
he
set
forth
his
proofs
that
comets
are
heavenly
bodies
moving
in
parabolas
of
which
the
sun
is
the
focus
bernouilli
arrived
at
the
same
conclusion
and
finally
this
great
series
of
men
and
works
was
closed
by
the
greatest
of
all
when
newton
in
having
taken
the
data
furnished
by
the
comet
of
demonstrated
that
comets
are
guided
in
their
movements
by
the
same
principle
that
controls
the
planets
in
their
orbits
thus
was
completed
the
evolution
of
this
new
truth
in
science
yet
we
are
not
to
suppose
that
these
two
great
series
of
philosophical
and
scientific
victories
cleared
the
field
of
all
opponents
declamation
and
pretended
demonstration
of
the
old
theologic
view
were
still
heard
but
the
day
of
complete
victory
dawned
when
halley
after
most
thorough
observation
and
calculation
recognised
the
comet
of
as
one
which
had
already
appeared
at
stated
periods
and
foretold
its
return
in
about
years
and
the
battle
was
fully
won
when
clairaut
seconded
by
lalande
and
mme
lepaute
predicted
distinctly
the
time
when
the
comet
would
arrive
at
its
perihelion
and
this
prediction
was
verified
then
it
was
that
a
roman
heathen
philosopher
was
proved
more
infallible
and
more
directly
under
divine
inspiration
than
a
roman
christian
pontiff
for
the
very
comet
which
the
traveller
finds
depicted
on
the
bayeux
tapestry
as
portending
destruction
to
harold
and
the
saxons
at
the
norman
invasion
of
england
and
which
was
regarded
by
pope
calixtus
as
portending
evil
to
christendom
was
found
six
centuries
later
to
be
as
seneca
had
prophesied
a
heavenly
body
obeying
the
great
laws
of
the
universe
and
coming
at
regular
periods
thenceforth
the
whole
ponderous
enginery
of
this
superstition
with
its
regarding
signs
in
the
heavens
its
theological
reasoning
to
show
the
moral
necessity
of
cometary
warnings
and
its
ecclesiastical
fulminations
against
the
atheism
godlessness
and
infidelity
of
scientific
investigation
was
seen
by
all
thinking
men
to
be
as
weak
against
the
scientific
method

a

attempt
always
seen
under
like
circumstances
to
effect
a
compromise
to
establish
a
safe
science
on
grounds
and
luther
with
his
strong
common
sense
had
foreshadowed
this
kepler
had
expressed
a
willingness
to
accept
it
it
was
insisted
that
comets
might
be
heavenly
bodies
moving
in
regular
orbits
and
even
obedient
to
law
and
yet
be
sent
as
signs
in
the
heavens
many
good
men
clung
longingly
to
this
phase
of
the
old
belief
and
in
semler
professor
at
halle
tried
to
satisfy
both
sides
he
insisted
that
while
from
a
scientific
point
of
view
comets
could
not
exercise
any
physical
influence
upon
the
world
yet
from
a
religious
point
of
view
they
could
exercise
a
moral
influence
as
reminders
of
the
just
judge
of
the
universe
so
hard
was
it
for
good
men
to
give
up
the
doctrine
of
signs
in
the
heavens
seemingly
based
upon
scripture
and
exercising
such
a
healthful
moral
tendency
as
is
always
the
case
after
such
a
defeat
these
votaries
of
sacred
science
exerted
the
greatest
ingenuity
in
devising
statements
and
arguments
to
avert
the
new
doctrine
within
our
own
century
the
great
catholic
champion
joseph
de
maistre
echoed
these
in
declaring
his
belief
that
comets
are
special
warnings
of
evil
so
too
in
protestant
england
in
the
gentleman
magazine
stated
that
under
the
malign
influence
of
a
recent
comet
flies
became
blind
and
died
early
in
the
season
and
the
wife
of
a
london
shoemaker
had
four
children
at
a
birth
and
even
as
late
as
forster
an
english
physician
published
a
work
to
prove
that
comets
produce
hot
summers
cold
winters
epidemics
earthquakes
clouds
of
midges
and
locusts
and
nearly
every
calamity
conceivable
he
bore
especially
upon
the
fact
that
the
comet
of
was
coincident
with
the
plague
in
london
apparently
forgetting
that
the
other
great
cities
of
england
and
the
continent
were
not
thus
visited
and
in
a
climax
announces
the
fact
that
the
comet
of
made
all
the
cats
in
westphalia
sick
there
still
lingered
one
little
of
superstition
arising
mainly
from
the
supposed
fact
that
comets
had
really
been
followed
by
a
marked
rise
in
temperature
even
this
poor
basis
for
the
belief
that
they
might
after
all
affect
earthly
affairs
was
swept
away
and
science
won
here
another
victory
for
arago
by
thermometric
records
carefully
kept
at
paris
from
to
proved
that
comets
had
produced
no
effect
upon
temperature
among
multitudes
of
similar
examples
he
showed
that
in
some
years
when
several
comets
appeared
the
temperature
was
lower
than
in
other
years
when
few
or
none
appeared
in
there
were
two
comets
and
the
weather
was
cool
in
there
was
no
comet
and
the
weather
was
hot
through
the
whole
fifty
years
it
was
shown
that
comets
were
sometimes
followed
by
hot
weather
sometimes
by
cool
and
that
no
rule
was
deducible
the
victory
of
science
was
complete
at
every
point
for
forster
see

illustrations
of
the

cited
by

also
in
quarterly
review
for
april
for
the
writings
of
several
on
both
sides
and
especially
those
who
sought
to
save
as
far
as
possible
the
sacred
theory
of
comets
see
madler
vol
ii
et
and
wolf
but
in
this
history
there
was
one
little
exhibition
so
curious
as
to
be
worthy
of
notice
though
its
permanent
effect
upon
thought
was
small
whiston
and
burnet
so
devoted
to
what
they
considered
sacred
science
had
determined
that
in
some
way
comets
must
be
instruments
of
divine
wrath
one
of
them
maintained
that
the
deluge
was
caused
by
the
tail
of
a
comet
striking
the
earth
the
other
put
forth
the
theory
that
comets
are
places
of
punishment
for
the
damned
in
fact
flying
hells
the
theories
of
whiston
and
burnet
found
wide
acceptance
also
in
germany
mainly
through
the
mediation
of
gottsched
so
long
from
his
professor
chair
at
leipsic
the
dictator
of
orthodox
thought
who
not
only
wrote
a
brief
tractate
of
his
own
upon
the
subject
but
furnished
a
voluminous
historical
introduction
to
the
more
elaborate
treatise
of
heyn
in
this
book
which
appeared
at
leipsic
in
the
agency
of
comets
in
the
creation
the
flood
and
the
final
destruction
of
the
world
is
fully
proved
both
these
theories
were
however
soon
discredited
perhaps
the
more
interesting
of
them
can
best
be
met
by
another
which
if
not
fully
established
appears
much
better
based
namely
that
in
the
earth
passed
directly
through
the
tail
of
a
comet
with
no
deluge
no
sound
of
any
wailings
of
the
damned
with
but
slight
appearances
here
and
there
only
to
be
detected
by
the
keen
sight
of
the
meteorological
or
astronomical
observer
in
our
own
country
superstitious
ideas
regarding
comets
continued
to
have
some
little
currency
but
their
life
was
short
the
tendency
shown
by
cotton
mather
at
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
toward
acknowledging
the
victory
of
science
was
completed
by
the
utterances
of
winthrop
professor
at
harvard
who
in
published
two
lectures
on
comets
in
which
he
simply
and
clearly
revealed
the
truth
never
scoffing
but
reasoning
quietly
and
reverently
in
one
passage
he
says
to
be
thrown
into
a
panic
whenever
a
comet
appears
on
account
of
the
ill
effects
which
some
few
of
them
might
possibly
produce
if
they
were
not
under
proper
direction
betrays
a
weakness
unbecoming
a
reasonable
being
a
happy
influence
in
this
respect
was
exercised
on
both
continents
by
john
wesley
tenaciously
as
he
had
held
to
the
supposed
scriptural
view
in
so
many
other
matters
of
science
in
this
he
allowed
his
reason
to
prevail
accepted
the
demonstrations
of
halley

them

appeal
no

the
deepest
things
in
the
human
heart
in

serviceable
as
the
idea
of
firebrands
thrown
by
the
right
hand
of
an
avenging
god
to
scare
a
naughty
world
might
seem
any
competent
historian
must
find
that
the
destruction
of
the
old
theological
cometary
theory
was
followed
by
moral
improvement
rather
than
by
deterioration
we
have
but
to
compare
the
general
moral
tone
of
society
wretchedly
imperfect
as
it
is
with
that
existing
in
the
time
when
this
superstition
had
its
strongest
hold
we
have
only
to
compare
the
court
of
henry
viii
with
the
court
of
victoria
the
reign
of
the
later
valois
and
earlier
bourbon
princes
with
the

the

monstrous
wickedness
of
the
thirty
years

with
the
ennobling
patriotism
of

and

of

miserable
german
princelings
of
the
sixteenth

seventeenth
centuries
with
the
reign
of

emperor
william
the
gain
is
not
simply
that
mankind
has
arrived
at
a
clearer
conception
of
law
in
the
universe
not
merely
that
thinking
men
see
more
clearly
that
we
are
part
of
a
system
not
requiring
constant
patching
and
arbitrary
interference
but
perhaps
best
of
all
is
the
fact
that
science
has
cleared
away
one
more
series
of
those
dogmas
which
tend
to
debase
rather
than
to
develop
whole
moral
and
religious
nature
in
this
emancipation
from
terror
and
fanaticism
as
in
so
many
other
results
of
scientific
thinking
we
have
a
proof
of
the
inspiration
of
those
great

chapter
from

i
growth
of
theological
explanations
among
the
philosophers
of
greece
we
find
even
at
an
early
period
germs
of
geological
truth
and
what
is
of
vast
importance
an
atmosphere
in
which
such
germs
could
grow
these
germs
were
transmitted
to
roman
thought
an
atmosphere
of
tolerance
continued
there
was
nothing
which
forbade
unfettered
reasoning
regarding
either
the
earth
strata
or
the
remains
of
former
life
found
in
them
and
under
the
roman
empire
a
period
of
fruitful
observation
seemed
sure
to
begin
but
as
christianity
took
control
of
the
world
there
came
a
great
change
the
earliest
attitude
of
the
church
toward
geology
and
its
kindred
sciences
was
indifferent
and
even
contemptuous
according
to
the
prevailing
belief
the
earth
was
a
fallen
world
and
was
soon
to
be
destroyed
why
then
should
it
be
studied
why
indeed
give
a
thought
to
it
the
scorn
which
lactantius
and
augustine
had
cast
upon
the
study
of
astronomy
was
extended
largely
to
other
sciences
for
a
compact
and
admirable
statement
as
to
the
dawn
of
geological
conceptions
in
greece
and
rome
see
lester
ward
essay
on
paleobotany
in
the
fifth
annual
report
of
the
united

geological
survey
for
as
to
the
reasons
why
greek
philosophers
did
comparatively
so
little
for
geology
see
geologie
for
the
contempt
felt
by
lactantius
and
augustine
toward
astronomical
science
see
foregoing
chapters
on
astronomy
and
geography
but
the
germs
of
scientific
knowledge
and
thought
developed
in
the
ancient
world
could
be
entirely
smothered
neither
by
eloquence
nor
by
logic
some
little
scientific
observation
must
be
allowed
though
all
close
reasoning
upon
it
was
fettered
by
theology
thus
it
was
that
jerome
insisted
that
the
broken
and
twisted
crust
of
the
earth
exhibits
the
wrath
of
god
against
sin
and
tertullian
asserted
that
fossils
resulted
from
the
flood
of
noah
to
keep
all
such
observation
and
reasoning
within
orthodox
limits
augustine
about
the
beginning
of
the
fifth
century
began
an
effort
to
develop
from
these
germs
a
growth
in
science
which
should
be
sacred
and
safe
with
this
intent
he
prepared
his
great
commentary
on
the
work
of
creation
as
depicted
in
genesis
besides
dwelling
upon
the
subject
in
other
writings
once
engaged
in
this
work
he
gave
himself
to
it
more
earnestly
than
any
other
of
the
earlier
fathers
ever
did
but
his
vast
powers
of
research
and
thought
were
not
directed
to
actual
observation
or
reasoning
upon
observation
the
keynote
of
his
whole
method
is
seen
in
his
famous
phrase
nothing
is
to
be
accepted
save
on
the
authority
of
scripture
since
greater
is
that
authority
than
all
the
powers
of
the
human
mind
all
his
thought
was
given
to
studying
the
letter
of
the
sacred
text
and
to
making
it
explain
natural
phenomena
by
methods
purely
theological
for
citations
and
authorities
on
these
points
see
the
chapter
on
meteorology
among
the
many
questions
he
then
raised
and
discussed
may
be
mentioned
such
as
these
what
caused
the
creation
of
the
stars
on
the
fourth
day
were
beasts
of
prey
and
venomous
animals
created
before
or
after
the
fall
of
adam
if
before
how
can
their
creation
be
reconciled
with
god
goodness
if
afterward
how
can
their
creation
be
reconciled
to
the
letter
of
god
word
why
were
only
beasts
and
birds
brought
before
adam
to
be
named
and
not
fishes
and
marine
animals
why
did
the
creator
not
say
fruitful
and
multiply
to
plants
as
well
as
to
animals

sundry
answers
to
these
and
similar
questions
formed
the
main
contributions
of

greatest
of

to
the
scientific
knowledge
of

after
a
most
thorough
study
of

profound
application

the
results
of
these
contributions
were
most
important
in
this
as
in
so
many
other
fields
augustine
gave
direction
to
the
main
current
of
thought
in
western
europe
catholic
and
protestant
for
nearly
thirteen
centuries
in
the
ages
that
succeeded

his

such
leaders
of

as
isidore
in

seventh
century
and
the
venerable
bede
in
the
eighth
planting
themselves
upon
augustine
premises
only
ventured
timidly
to
extend
their
conclusions
upon
lines
he
had
laid
down
in
his
great
work
on
etymologies
isidore
took
up
augustine
attempt
to
bring
the
creation
into
satisfactory
relations
with
the
book
of
genesis
and
as
to
fossil
remains
he
like
tertullian
thought
that
they
resulted
from
the
flood
of
noah
in
the
following
century

the
best
guess
in
a
geological
sense
among
the
followers
of
augustine
was
made
by
an
irish
monkish
scholar
who
in
order
to
diminish
the
difficulty
arising
from
the
distribution
of
animals
especially
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
same
animals
are
found
in
ireland
as
in
england
held
that
various
lands
now
separated
were
once
connected
but
alas
the
exigencies
of
theology
forced
him
to
place
their
separation
later
than
the
flood
happily
for
him
such
facts
were
not
yet
known
as
that
the
kangaroo
is
found
only
on
an
island
in
the
south
pacific
and
must
therefore
according
to
his
theory
have
migrated
thither
with
all
his
progeny
and
along
a
causeway
so
curiously
constructed
that
none
of
the
beasts
of
prey
who
were
his
in
the
ark
could
follow
him
these
general
lines
of
thought
upon
geology
and
its
kindred
science
of
zoology
were
followed
by
thomas
aquinas
and
by
the
whole
body
of
medieval
theologians
so
far
as
they
gave
any
attention
to
such
subjects
the
next
development
of
geology
mainly
under
church
guidance
was
by
means
of
the
scholastic
theology
was
substituted
for
investigation
without
the
church
and
within
it
wonderful
contributions
were
thus
made
in
the
eleventh
century

attributed
them
to
a
formative
quality
in
the
following
centuries
some
philosophers
ventured
the
idea
that
they
grew
from
seed
and
the
aristotelian
doctrine
of
spontaneous
generation
was
constantly
used
to
prove
that
these
stony
fossils
possessed
powers
of
reproduction

by
the

of
the
koran
than
the
contemporary

by

of

and
to
avicenna
belongs
the
credit
of
first
announcing
substantially
the
modern
geological
theory
of
changes
in
the
earth
surface
for
avicenna
see
lyell
and
the
direct
influence
of
the
reformation
was
at
first
unfavourable
to
scientific
progress
for
nothing
could
be
more
at
variance
with
any
scientific
theory
of
the
development
of
the
universe
than
the
ideas
of
the
protestant
leaders
that
strict
adherence
to
the
text
of
scripture
which
made
luther
and
melanchthon
denounce
the
idea
that
the
planets
revolve
about
the
sun
was
naturally
extended
to
every
other
scientific
statement
at
variance
with
the
sacred
text
there
is
much
reason
to
believe
that
the
fetters
upon
scientific
thought
were
closer
under
the
strict
interpretation
of
scripture
by
the
early
protestants
than
they
had
been
under
the
older
church
the
dominant
spirit
among
the
reformers
is
shown
by
the
declaration
of
peter
martyr
to
the
effect
that
if
a
wrong
opinion
should
obtain
regarding
the
creation
as
described
in
genesis
all
the
promises
of
christ
fall
into
nothing
and
all
the
life
of
our
religion
would
be
lost

in
the
times
immediately
succeeding
the
reformation
matters
went
from
bad
to
worse
under
luther
and
melanchthon
there
was
some
little
freedom
of
speculation
but
under
their
successors
there
was
none
to
question
any
interpretation
of
luther
came
to
be
thought
almost
as
wicked
as
to
question
the
literal
interpretation
of
the
scriptures
themselves
examples
of
this
are
seen
in
the
struggles
between
those
who
held
that
birds
were
created
entirely
from

those
who
held

were

strict
text
of

alone
is
safety
that
it
contains
all
wisdom
and
knowledge
human
and
divine
this
being
the
case
who
could
care
to
waste
time
on
the
study
of
material
things
and
give
thought
to
the
structure
of
the
world
above
all
who
after
such
a
proclamation
by
such
a
ruler
in
the
lutheran
israel
would
dare
to
talk
of
the
days
mentioned
in

as
periods
of
time
or
of

as
not
meaning
a
solid

of

in

origination
of

published
in
the
strictest
devotion
to
a
theory
of
creation
based
upon
the
mere
letter
of
scripture
and
a
complete
inability
to
draw
knowledge
regarding
the
earth
origin
and
structure
from
any
other
source
while
the
lutheran
calvinistic
and
anglican
reformers
clung
to
literal
interpretations
of
the
sacred
books
and
turned
their
faces
away
from
scientific
investigation
it
was
among
their
contemporaries
at
the
revival
of
learning
that
there
began
to
arise
fruitful
thought
in
this
field
then
it
was
about
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
that
leonardo
da
vinci
as
great
a
genius
in
science
as
in
art
broached
the
true
idea
as
to
the
origin
of
fossil
remains
and
his
compatriot
fracastoro
developed
this
on
the
modern
lines
of
thought
others
in
other
parts
of
europe
took
up
the
idea
and
while
mixing
with
it
many
crudities
drew
from
it
more
and
more
truth
toward
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
bernard
palissy
in

took
hold
of
it
with
the
same
genius
which
he
showed
in
artistic
creation
but
remarkable
as
were
his
assertions
of
scientific
realities
they
could
gain
little
hearing
theologians
philosophers
and
even
some
scientific
men
of
value
under
the
sway
of
scholastic
phrases
continued
to
insist
upon
such
explanations
as
that
fossils
were
the
product
of
fatty
matter
set
into
a
fermentation
by
heat
or
of
a
lapidific
juice
or
of
a
seminal
air
or
of
a
tumultuous
movement
of
terrestrial
exhalations
and
there
was
a
prevailing
belief
that
fossil
remains
in
general
might
be
brought
under
the
head
of
sports
of
nature
a
pious
turn
being
given
to
this

the
marvellous
likenesses
of
two
hundred
figured
or
rather
insectiform
stones
beringer
for
the
greater
glory
of
god
had
previously
committed
himself
so
completely
to
the
theory
that
fossils
are
simply
stones
of
a
peculiar
sort
hidden
by
the
author
of
nature
for
his
own
pleasure
that
some
of
his
students
determined
to
give
his
faith
in
that
pious
doctrine
a
thorough
trial
they
therefore
prepared
a
collection
of
sham
fossils
in
baked
clay
imitating
not
only
plants
reptiles
and
fishes
of
every
sort
that
their
knowledge
or
imagination
could
suggest
but
even
hebrew
and
syriac
inscriptions
one
of
them
the
name
of
the
almighty
and
these
they
buried
in
a
place
where
the
professor
was
wont
to
search
for
specimens
the
joy
of
beringer
on
unearthing
these
proofs
of
the
immediate
agency
of
the
finger
of
god
in
creating
fossils
knew
no
bounds
at
great
cost
he
prepared
this
book
whose
elaborate
plates
of
facsimiles
were
forever
to
settle
the
question
in
favour
of
theology
and
against
science
and
prefixed
to
the
work
an
allegorical
title
page
wherein
not
only
the
glory
of
his
own
sovereign
but
that
of
heaven
itself
was
pictured
as
based
upon
a
pyramid
of
these
miraculous
fossils
so
robust
was
his
faith
that
not
even
a
premature
exposure
of
the
fraud
could
dissuade
him
from
the
publication
of
his
book
dismissing
in
one
contemptuous
chapter
this
exposure
as
a
slander
by
his
rivals
he
appealed
to
the
learned
world
but
the
shout
of
laughter
that
welcomed
the
work
soon
convinced
even
its
author
in
vain
did
he
try
to
suppress
it
and
according
to
tradition
having
wasted
his
fortune
in
vain
attempts
to
buy
up
all
the
copies
of
it
and
being
taunted
by
the
rivals
whom
he
had
thought
to
overwhelm
he
died
of
chagrin
even
death
did
not
end
his
misfortunes
the
copies
of
the
first
edition
having
been
sold
by
a
graceless
descendant
to
a
leipsic
bookseller
a
second
edition
was
brought
out
under
a
new
title
and
this
too
is
now
much
sought
as
a
precious
memorial
of
human
credulity

and

but
even
this
discomfiture
did
not
end
the
idea
which
had
caused
it
for
although
some
latitude
was
allowed
among
the
various
explanations
it
was
still
held
meritorious
to
believe
that
all
fossils
were
placed
in
the
strata
on
one
of
the
creative
days
by
the
hand
of
the
almighty
and
that
this
was
done
for
some
mysterious
purpose
probably
for
the
trial
of
human
faith
strange
as
it
may
at
first
seem
the
theological
war
against
a
scientific
method
in
geology
was
waged
more
fiercely
in
protestant
countries
than
in
catholic
the
older
church
had
learned
by
her
costly
mistakes
especially
in
the
cases
of
copernicus
and
galileo
what
dangers
to
her
claim
of
infallibility
lay
in
meddling
with
a
growing
science
in
italy
therefore
comparatively
little
opposition
was
made
while
england
furnished
the
most
bitter
opponents
to
geology
so
long
as
the
controversy
could
be
maintained
and
the
most
active
negotiators
in
patching
up
a
truce
on
the
basis
of
a
sham
science
afterward
the
church
of
england
did
indeed
produce
some
noble
men
like
bishop
clayton
and
john
mitchell
who
stood
firmly
by
the
scientific
method
but
these
appear
generally
to
have
been
overwhelmed
by
a
chorus
of
churchmen
and
dissenters
whose
mixtures
of
theology
and
science
sometimes
tragic
in
their
results
and
sometimes
comic
are
among
the
most
instructive
things
in
modern
history

a
comparison
between
the
conduct
of
italian
and
english
ecclesiastics

geology

than
elsewhere

the
first
of
these
gentlemen
it
must
not
be
forgotten
is
a
roman
catholic
clergyman
and
the
second
an
eminent
layman
of
the
same
church
and
both
admit
that
it
was
the
pope
speaking
ex
cathedra
who
erred
in
the
galileo
case
but
their
explanation
is
that
god
allowed
the
pope
and
church
to
fall
into
this
grievous
error
which
has
cost
so
dear
in
order
to
show
once
and
for
all
that
the
church
has
no
right
to
decide
questions
in
science
we
have
already
noted
that
there
are
generally
three
periods
or
phases
in
a
theological
attack
upon
any
science
the
first
of
these
is
marked
by
the
general
use
of
scriptural
texts
and
statements
against
the
new
scientific
doctrine
the
third
by
attempts
at
compromise
by
means
of
reconciliations
of
textual
statements
with
ascertained
fact
but
the
second
or
intermediate
period
between
these
two
is
frequently
marked
by
the
pitting
against
science
of
some
great
doctrine
in
theology
we
saw
this
in
astronomy
when
bellarmin
and
his
followers
insisted
that
the
scientific
doctrine
of
the
earth
revolving
about
the
sun
is
contrary
to
the
theological
doctrine
of
the
incarnation
so
now
against
geology
it
was
urged
that
the
scientific
doctrine
that
fossils
represent
animals
which
died
before
adam
contradicts
the
theological
doctrine
of
adam
fall
and
the
statement
that
death
entered
the
world
by
sin
in
this
second
stage
of
the
theological
struggle
with
geology
england
was
especially
fruitful
in
champions
of
orthodoxy
first
among
whom
may
be
named
thomas
burnet
in
the
last
quarter
of
the
seventeenth
century
just
at
the
time
when
newton
great
discovery
was
given
to
the
world
burnet
issued
his
sacred
theory
of
the
earth
his
position
was
commanding
he
was
a
royal
chaplain
and
a
cabinet
officer
planting
himself
upon
the
famous
text
in
the
second
epistle
of
peter
he
declares
that
the
flood
had
destroyed
the
old
and
created
a
new
world
the
newtonian
theory
he
refuses
to
accept
in
his
theory
of
the
deluge
he
lays
less
stress
upon
the
opening
of
the
windows
of
heaven
than
upon
the
breaking
up
of
the
fountains
of
the
great
deep
on
this
latter
point
he
comes
forth
with
great
strength
his
theory
is
that
the
earth
is
hollow
and
filled
with
fluid
like
an
egg
mixing
together
sundry
texts
from
genesis
and
from
the
second
epistle
of
peter
the
theological
doctrine
of
the
fall
an
astronomical
theory
regarding
the
ecliptic
and
various
notions
adapted
from
descartes
he
insisted
that
before
sin
brought
on
the
deluge
the
earth
was
of
perfect
mathematical
form
smooth
and
beautiful
like
an
egg
with
neither
seas
nor
islands
nor
valleys
nor
rocks
with
not
a
wrinkle
scar
or
fracture
and
that
all
creation
was
equally
perfect
see
ii
peter
iii
in
the
second
book
of
his
great
work
burnet
went
still
further
as
in
his
first
book
he
had
mixed
his
texts
of
genesis
and
peter
with
descartes
he
now
mixed
the
account
of
the
garden
of
eden
in
genesis
with
heathen
legends
of
the
golden
age
and
concluded
that
before
the
flood
there
was
over
the
whole
earth
perpetual
spring
disturbed
by
no
rain
more
severe
than
the
falling
of
the
dew
in
addition
to
his
other
grounds
for
denying
the
earlier
existence
of
the
sea
he
assigned
the
reason
that
if
there
had
been
a
sea
before
the
deluge
sinners
would
have
learned
to
build
ships
and
so
when
the
deluge
set
in
could
have
saved
themselves
the
work
was
written
with
much
power
and
attracted
universal
attention
it
was
translated
into
various
languages
and
called
forth
a
multitude
of
supporters
and
opponents
in
all
parts
of
europe
strong
men
rose
against
it
especially
in
england
and
among
them
a
few
dignitaries
of
the
church
but
the
church
generally
hailed
the
work
with
joy
addison
praised
it
in
a
latin
ode
and
for
nearly
a
century
it
exercised
a
strong
influence
upon
european
feeling
and
aided
to
plant
more
deeply
than
ever
the
theological
opinion
that
the
earth
as
now
existing
is
merely
a
ruin
whereas
before
sin
brought
on
the
flood
it
was
beautiful
in
its
form
and
free
from
every
imperfection
a
few
years
later
came
another
writer
of
the
highest
standing
william
whiston
professor
at
cambridge
who
in
published
his
new
theory
of
the
earth
unlike
burnet
he
endeavoured
to
avail
himself
of
the
newtonian
idea
and
brought
in
to
aid
the
geological
catastrophe
caused
by
human
sin
a
comet
which
broke
open
the
fountains
of
the
great
deep
but
far
more
important
than
either
of
these
champions
there
arose
in
the
eighteenth
century
to
aid
in
the
subjection
of
science
to
theology
three
men
of
extraordinary
power
john
wesley
adam
clarke
and
richard
watson
all
three
were
men
of
striking
intellectual
gifts
lofty
character
and
noble
purpose
and
the
one
of
the
greatest
men
in
english
history
yet
we
find
them
in
geology
hopelessly
fettered
by
the
mere
letter
of
scripture
and
by
a
temporary
phase
in
theology
as
in
regard
to
witchcraft
and
the
doctrine
of
comets
so
in
regard
to
geology
this
theological
view
drew
wesley
into
enormous
error
the
great
doctrine
which
wesley
watson
clarke
and
their
compeers
following
augustine
bede
peter
lombard
and
a
long
line
of
the
greatest
minds
in
the
universal
church
thought
it
especially
necessary
to
uphold
against
geologists
was
that
death
entered
the
world
by
sin
by
the
first
transgression
of
adam
and
eve
the
extent
to
which
the
supposed
necessity
of
upholding
this
doctrine
carried
wesley
seems
now
almost
beyond
belief
basing
his
theology
on
the
declaration
that
the
almighty
after
creation
found
the
earth
and
all
created
things
very
good
he
declares
in
his
sermon
on
the
cause
and
cure
of
earthquakes
that
no
one
who
believes
the
scriptures
can
deny
that
sin
is
the
moral
cause
of
earthquakes
whatever
their
natural
cause
may
be
again
he
declares
that
earthquakes
are
the
effect
of
that
curse
which
was
brought
upon
the
earth
by
the
original
transgression
bringing
into
connection
with
genesis
the
declaration
of
paul
that
the
whole
creation
groaneth
and
travaileth
together
in
pain
until
now
he
finds
additional
scriptural
proof
that
the
earthquakes
were
the
result
of
adam
fall
he
declares
in
his
sermon
on
god
approbation
of
his
works
that
before
the
sin
of
adam
there
were
no
agitations
within
the
bowels
of
the
earth
no
violent
convulsions
no
concussions
of
the
earth
no
earthquakes
but
all
was
unmoved
as
the
pillars
of
heaven
there
were
then
no
such
things
as
eruptions
of
fires
no
volcanoes
or
burning
mountains
of
course
a
science
which
showed
that
earthquakes
had
been
in
operation
for
ages
before
the
appearance
of
man
on
the
planet
and
which
showed
also
that
those
very
earthquakes
which
he
considered
as
curses
resultant
upon
the
fall
were
really
blessings
producing
the
fissures
in
which
we
find
today
those
mineral
veins
so
essential
to
modern
civilization
was
entirely
beyond
his
comprehension
he
insists
that
earthquakes
are
god
strange
works
of
judgment
the
proper
effect
and
punishment
of
sin
for
his
statement
that
the
giving
up
of
witchcraft
is
in
effect
the
giving
up
of
the
bible
see
welsey
journal
so
too
as
to
death
and
pain
in
his
sermon
on
the
fall
of
man
he
took
the
ground
that
death
and
pain
entered
the
world
by
transgression
insisting
that
the
carnage
now
going
on
among
animals
is
the
result
of
adam
sin
speaking
of
the
birds
beasts
and
insects
he
says
that
before
sin
entered
the
world
by
adam
fall
none
of
these
attempted
to
devour
or
in
any
way
hurt
one
another
that
the
spider
was
then
as
harmless
as
the
fly
and
did
not
then
lie
in
wait
for
blood
here
again
wesley
arrayed
his
early
followers
against
geology
which
reveals
in
the
fossil
remains
of
carnivorous
animals
pain
and
death
countless
ages
before
the
appearance
of
man
the
fragments
of
weaker
animals
within
the
fossilized
bodies
of
the
stronger
have
destroyed
all
wesley
arguments

of
his
great
theory

views

of

treating

we
have
no
reason
at
all
to
believe
that
the
animal
had
a
serpentine
form
in
any
mode
or
degree
until
his
transformation
that
he
was
then
degraded
to
a
reptile
to
go
upon
his
belly
imports
on
the
contrary
an
entire
alteration

of
the
original
form
all
that
admirable
adjustment
of
the
serpent
to
its
environment
which
delights
naturalists
was
to
the
wesleyan
divine
simply
an
evil
result
of
the
sin
of

here

as

such
was
the
influence

this
succession
of
great
men
that
toward
the
close
of

last

the
english
opponents
of

on

seemed
likely
to
sweep
all
before

cramping

literature

compend

showed
the
terrible

difficult
as
it
is
to
realize
it
now
within
the
memory
of
many
now
living
the
battle
was
still
raging
most
fiercely
in
england
and
both
kinds
of
artillery
usually
brought
against
a
new
science
were
in
full
play
and
filling
the
civilized
world
with
their
roar
about
half
a
century
since
the
rev
mellor
brown
the
rev
henry

and
others
were
hurling
at
all

the
favourite
weapon
of
the
orthodox
party
was
the
charge
that
the
geologists
were
attacking
the
truth
of
god
they
declared
geology
not
a
subject
of
lawful
inquiry
denouncing
it
as
a
dark
art
as
dangerous
and
disreputable
as
a
forbidden
province
as
infernal
artillery
and
as
an
awful
evasion

the
testimony
of

this
attempt
to
scare
men
from
the
science
having
failed
various
other
means
were
taken
to
say
nothing
about
england
it
is
humiliating
to
human
nature
to
remember
the
annoyances
and
even
trials
to
which
the
pettiest
and
narrowest
of
men
subjected
such
christian
scholars
in
our
own
country
as
benjamin
silliman
and
edward
hitchcock
and
louis
agassiz
but
it
is
a
duty
and
a
pleasure
to
state
here
that
one
great
christian
scholar
did
honour
to
religion
and
to
himself
by
quietly
accepting
the
claims
of
science
and
making
the
best
of
them
despite
all
these
clamours
this
man
was
nicholas
wiseman
better
known
afterward
as
cardinal
wiseman
the
conduct
of
this
pillar
of
the
roman
catholic
church
contrasts
admirably
with
that
of
timid
protestants

were

stuart
of
andover
justly
honoured
as
a
hebrew
scholar
declared
that
to
speak
of
six
periods
of
time
for
the
creation
was
flying
in
the
face
of
scripture
that
genesis
expressly
speaks
of
six
days
each
made
up
of
the
evening
and
the
morning
and
not
six
periods
of
time
to
him
replied
a
professor
in
yale
college
james
kingsley
in
an
article
admirable
for
keen
wit
and
kindly
temper
he
showed
that
genesis
speaks
just
as
clearly
of
a
solid
firmament
as
of
six
ordinary
days
and
that
if
stuart
had
surmounted
one
difficulty
and
accepted
the
copernican
theory
he
might
as
well
get
over
another
and
accept
the
revelations
of
geology
the
encounter
was
quick
and
decisive
and
the
victory
was
with
science

broader
scholarship

perhaps
the
most
singular
attempt
against
geology
was
made
by
a
fine
survival
of
the
eighteenth
century
don
dean
cockburn
of
york
to
scold
its
champions
off
the
field
having
no
adequate
knowledge
of
the
new
science
he
opened
a
battery
of
abuse
giving
it
to
the
world
at
large
from
the
pulpit
and
through
the
press
and
even
through
private
letters
from
his
pulpit
in
york
minster
he
denounced
mary
somerville
by
name
for
those
studies
in
physical
geography
which
have
made
her
name
honoured
throughout
the
world
but
the
special
object
of
his
antipathy
was
the
british
association
for
the
advancement
of
science
he
issued
a
pamphlet
against
it
which
went
through
five
editions
in
two
years
sent
solemn
warnings
to
its
president
and
in
various
ways
made
life
a
burden
to
sedgwick
buckland
and
other
eminent
investigators
who
ventured
to
state
geological
facts
as
they
found
them
these
weapons
were
soon
seen
to
be
ineffective
they
were
like
chinese
gongs
and
dragon
lanterns
against
rifled
cannon
the

of

nothing
has
afforded
me
so
convincing
a
proof
of
the
deity
as
these
purely
mental
conceptions
of
numerical
and
mathematical
science
which
have
been
by
slow
degrees
vouchsafed
to
man
and
are
still
granted

latter
times

the
first
great
effort
at
compromise
based
on
the
flood
of
noah
long
before
the
end
of
the
struggle
already
described
even
at
a
very
early
period
the
futility
of
the
usual
scholastic
weapons
had
been
seen
by
the
more
champions
of
orthodoxy
and
as
the
difficulties
of
the
ordinary
attack
upon
science
became
more
and
more
evident
many
of
these
champions
endeavoured
to
patch
up
a
truce
so
began
the
third
stage
in
the
war
the
period
of
attempts
at
compromise
the
position
which
the
compromise
party
took
was
that
the
fossils
were
produced
by
the
deluge
of
noah
this
position
was
strong
for
it
was
apparently
based
upon
scripture
moreover
it
had
high
ecclesiastical
sanction
some
of
the
fathers
having
held
that
fossil
remains
even
on
the
highest
mountains
represented
animals
destroyed
at
the
deluge
tertullian
was
especially
firm
on
this
point
and
augustine
thought
that
a
fossil
tooth
discovered
in
north
africa
must
have
belonged
to
one
of
the
giants
mentioned
in
scripture
for
tertullian

fourth

vol

in
the
sixteenth
century
especially
weight
began
to
be
attached
to
this
idea
by
those
who
felt
the
worthlessness
of
various
scholastic
explanations
strong
men
in
both
the
catholic
and
the
protestant
camps
accepted
it
but
the
man
who
did
most
to
give
it
an
impulse
into
modern
theology
was
martin
luther
he
easily
saw
that
scholastic
could
not
meet
the
difficulties
raised
by
fossils
and
he
naturally
urged
the
doctrine
of
their
origin
at
noah
flood
for
luther
opinion
see
his
commentary
on
genesis
with
such
support
it
soon
became
the
dominant
theory
in
christendom
nothing
seemed
able
to
stand
against
it
but
before
the
end
of
the
same
sixteenth
century
it
met
some
serious
obstacles
bernard
palissy
one
of
the
most
of
scientific
thinkers
in
france
as
well
as
one
of
the
most
devoted
of
christians
showed
that
it
was
utterly
untenable
conscientious
investigators
in
other
parts
of
europe
and
especially
in
italy
showed
the
same
thing
all
in
vain
in
vain
did
good
men
protest
against
the
injury
sure
to
be
brought
upon
religion
by
tying
it
to
a
scientific
theory
sure
to
be
exploded
the
doctrine
that
fossils
are
the
remains
of
animals
drowned
at
the
flood
continued
to
be
upheld
by
the
great
majority
of
theological
leaders
for
nearly
three
centuries
as
sound
doctrine
and
as
a
blessed
means
of
reconciling
science
with
scripture
to
sustain
this
scriptural
view
efforts
energetic
and
persistent
were
put
forth
both
by
catholics
and
protestants
for
a
very
full
statement
of
the
honourable
record
of
italy
in
this
respect
and
for
the
enlightened
views
of
some
italian
churchmen

milan
pp
et

in

the

benedictine
calmet
in
his
great
works
on

bible
accepted
it
as
late
as
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
believing
the
mastodon
bones
exhibited
by
mazurier
to
be
those
of
king
teutobocus
and
holding
them
valuable
testimony
to
the
existence
of
the
giants
mentioned
in
scripture
and
of
the
early
inhabitants
of
the
earth
overwhelmed
by
the
flood
for
the
steady
adherence
to
this
sacred
theory

but
the
greatest
champion
appeared
in
england
we
have
already
seen
how
near
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century
thomas
burnet
prepared
the
way
in
his
sacred
theory
of
the
earth
by
rejecting
the
discoveries
of
newton
and
showing
how
sin
led
to
the
breaking
up
of
the
foundations
of
the
great
deep
and
we
have
also
seen
how
whiston
in
his
new
theory
of
the
earth
while
yielding
a
little
and
accepting
the
discoveries
of
newton
brought
in
a
comet
to
aid
in
producing
the
deluge
but
far
more
important
than
these
in
permanent
influence
was
john
woodward
professor
at
gresham
college
a
leader
in
scientific
thought
at
the
university
of
cambridge
and
as
a
patient
collector
of
fossils
and
an
earnest
investigator
of
their
meaning
deserving
of
the
highest
respect
in
he
published
his
natural
history
of
the
earth
and
rendered
one
great
service
to
science
for
he
yielded
another
point
and
thus
destroyed
the
foundations
for
the
old
theory
of
fossils
he
showed
that
they
were
not
sports
of
nature
or
models
inserted
by
the
creator
in
the
strata
for
some
inscrutable
purpose
but
that
they
were
really
remains
of
living
beings
as
xenophanes
had
asserted
two
thousand
years
before
him
so
far
he
rendered
a
great
service
both
to
science
and
religion
but
this
done
the
text
of
the
old
testament
narrative
and
the
famous
passage
in
peter
epistle
were
too
strong
for
him
and
he
too
insisted
that
the
fossils
were
produced
by
the
deluge
aided
by
his
great
authority
the
assault
on
the
true
scientific
position
was

but
the
most
brilliant
service
rendered
to
the
theological
theory
came
from
another
quarter
for
in
scheuchzer
having
discovered
a
large
fossil
lizard
exhibited
it
to
the
world
as
the
human
witness
of
the
deluge
this
great
discovery
was
hailed
everywhere
with
joy
for
it
seemed
to
prove
not
only
that
human
beings
were
drowned
at
the
deluge
but
that
there
were
giants
in
those
days
cheered
by
the
applause
thus
gained
he
determined
to
make
the
theological
position
impregnable
mixing
together
various
texts
of
scripture
with
notions
derived
from
the
philosophy
of
descartes
and
the
speculations
of
whiston
he
developed
the
theory
that
the
fountains
of
the
great
deep
were
broken
up
by
the
direct
physical
action
of
the
hand
of
god
which
being
literally
applied
to
the
axis
of
the
earth
suddenly
stopped
the
earth
rotation
broke
up
the
fountains
of
the
great
deep
spilled
the
water
therein
contained
and
produced
the
deluge
but
his
service
to
sacred
science
did
not
end
here
for
he
prepared
an
edition
of
the
bible
in
which
magnificent
engravings
in
great
number
illustrated
his
view
and
enforced
it
upon
all
readers
of
these
engravings

but
far
more
prejudicial
to
christianity
was
the
continued
effort
on
the
other
side
to
show
that
the
fossils
were
caused
by
the
deluge
of
noah
no
supposition
was
too
violent
to
support
this
theory
which
was
considered
vital
to
the
bible
by
taking
the
mere
husks
and
rinds
of
biblical
truth
for
truth
itself
by
taking
sacred
poetry
as
prose
and
by
giving
a
literal
interpretation
of
it
the
followers
of
burnet
whiston
and
woodward
built
up
systems
which
bear
to
real
geology
much
the
same
relation
that
the
christian
topography
of
cosmas
bears
to
real
geography
in
vain
were
exhibited
the
absolute
geological
zoological
astronomical
proofs
that
no
universal
deluge

deluge
covering
any
large
part
of
the
earth
had
taken
place
within
the
last
six
thousand
or
sixty
thousand
years
in
vain
did
so
enlightened
a
churchman
as
bishop
clayton
declare
that
the
deluge
could
not
have
extended
beyond
that
district
where
noah
lived
before
the
flood
in
vain
did
others
like
bishop
croft
and
bishop
stillingfleet
and
the
nonconformist
matthew
poole
show
that
the
deluge
might
not
have
been
and
probably
was
not
universal
in
vain
was
it
shown
that
even
if
there
had
been
a
universal
deluge
the
fossils
were
not
produced

it
the
only
answers
were
the
citation
of

all
the
high

which
were
under

were
covered
and
to
clinch
the
matter
worthington
and
men
like
him
insisted
that
any
argument
to
show
that
fossils
were
not
remains
of
animals
drowned
at
the
deluge
of
noah
was
infidelity
in
england
france
and
germany
belief
that
the
fossils
were
produced
by
the
deluge
of
noah
was
widely
insisted
upon
as
part
of
that
faith
essential
to
salvation

not
even
the
splendid
engravings
in

could
stop

and
the
foundations
of

theological
theory
began
to
crumble
away

process
was
indeed
slow
it
required
a
hundred
and
twenty
years
for
the
searchers
of
god
truth
as
revealed
in

such
men
as
hooke
linnaeus
whitehurst
daubenton
cuvier
and
william

to
push
their
works
under
this
fabric
of
error
and
by
statements
which
could
not
be
resisted
to
undermine
it
as
we
arrive
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
science
is
becoming
irresistible
in
this
field
blumenbach
von
buch
and
schlotheim
led
the
way
but
most
important
on
the
continent
was
the
work
of
cuvier
in
the
early
years
of
the
present
century
his
researches
among
fossils
began
to
throw
new
light
into
the
whole
subject
of
geology
he
was
indeed
very
conservative
and
even
more
wary
and
diplomatic
seeming
like
voltaire
to
feel
that
among
wolves
one
must
howl
a
little
it
was
a
time
of
reaction
napoleon
had
made
peace
with
the
church
and
to
disturb
that
peace
was
akin
to
treason
by
large
but
vague
concessions
cuvier
kept
the
theologians
satisfied
while
he
undermined
their
strongest
fortress
the
danger
was
instinctively
felt
by
some
of
the
champions
of
the
church
and
typical
among
these
was
chateaubriand
who
in
his
work
once
so
great
now
so
little
the
genius
of
christianity
grappled
with
the
questions
of
creation
by
insisting
upon
a
sort
of
general
deception
in
the
beginning
under
which
everything
was
created
by
a
sudden
fiat
but
with
appearances
of
his
words
are
as
follows
it
was
part
of
the
perfection
and
harmony
of
the
nature
which
was
displayed
before
men
eyes
that
the
deserted
nests
of
last
year
birds
should
be
seen
on
the
trees
and
that
the
seashore
should
be
covered
with
shells
which
had
been
the
abode
of
fish
and
yet
the
world
was
quite
new
and
nests
and
shells
had
never
been
inhabited
but
the
real
victory
was
with
brongniart
who
about
gave
forth
his
work
on
fossil
plants
and
thus
built
a
barrier
against
which
the
enemies
of
science
raged
in
vain

christianisme
pp
cited

i
for
admirable
sketches
of
brongniart
and
other
paleobotanists
see
ward
as
above
still
the
struggle
was
not
ended
and
a
few
years
later
a
forlorn
hope
was
led
in
england
by
granville
penn
his
fundamental
thesis
was
that
our
globe
has
undergone
only
two
revolutions
the
creation
and
the
deluge
and
both
by
the
immediate
fiat
of
the
almighty
he
insisted
that
the
creation
took
place
in
exactly
six
days
of
ordinary
time
each
made
up
of
the
evening
and
the
morning
and
he
ended
with
a
piece
of
that
peculiar
presumption
so
familiar
to
the
world
by
calling
on
cuvier
and
all
other
geologists
to
ask
for
the
old
paths
and
walk
therein
until
they
shall
simplify
their
system
and
reduce
their
numerous
revolutions
to
the
two
events
or
epochs
only
the
six
days
of
creation
and
the
deluge
the
geologists
showed
no
disposition
to
yield
to
this
peremptory
summons
on
the
contrary
the
president
of
the
british
geological
society
and
even
so
eminent
a
churchman
and
geologist
as
dean
buckland
soon
acknowledged
that
facts
obliged
them
to
give
up
the
theory
that
the
fossils
of
the
coal
measures
were
deposited
at
the
deluge
of
noah
and
to
deny
that
the
deluge
was
universal
see
the
works
of
granville
penn
vol
ii
the
defection
of
buckland
was
especially
felt
by
the
orthodox
party
his
ability
honesty
and
loyalty
to
his
profession
as
well
as
his
position
as
canon
of
christ
church
and
professor
of
geology
at
oxford
gave
him
great
authority
which
he
exerted
to
the
utmost
in
soothing
his
brother
ecclesiastics
in
his
inaugural
lecture
he
had
laboured
to
show
that
geology
confirmed
the
accounts
of
creation
and
the
flood
as
given
in
genesis
and
in
after
his
cave
explorations
had
revealed
overwhelming
evidences
of
the
vast
antiquity
of
the
earth
he
had
still
clung
to
the
flood
theory
in
his
reliquiae
diluvianae
this
had
not
indeed
fully
satisfied
the
party
but
as
a
rule
their
attacks
upon
him
took
the
form
not
so
much
of
abuse
as
of
humorous
disparagement
an
epigram
by
shuttleworth
afterward
bishop
of
chichester
in
imitation
of
pope
famous
lines
upon
newton
ran
as
follows
some
doubts
were
once
expressed
about
the
flood
buckland
arose
and
all
was
clear
as
mud
on
his
leaving
oxford
for
a
journey
to
southern
europe
dean
gaisford
was
heard
to
exclaim
well
buckland
is
gone
to
italy
so
thank
god
we
shall
have
no
more
of
this
geology
still
there
was
some
comfort
as
long
as
buckland
held
to
the
deluge
theory
but
on
his
surrender
the
combat
deepened
instead
of
epigrams
and
caricatures
came
bitter
attacks
and
from
the
pulpit
and
press
came
showers
of
missiles
the
worst
of
these
were
hurled
at
lyell
as
we
have
seen
he
had
published
in
his
principles
of
geology
nothing
could
have
been
more
cautious
it
simply
gave
an
account
of
the
main
discoveries
up
to
that
time
drawing
the
necessary
inferences
with
plain
yet
convincing
logic
and
it
remains
to
this
day
one
of
those
works
in
which
the
race
may
most
justly
take
pride
one
of
the
in
the
advance
of
human
thought
but
its
tendency
was
inevitably
at
variance
with
the
chaldean
and
other
ancient
myths
and
legends
regarding
the
creation
and
deluge
which
the
hebrews
had
received
from
the
older
civilizations
among
their
neighbours
and
had
incorporated
into
the
sacred
books
which
they
transmitted
to
the
modern
world
it
was
therefore
extensively
refuted
theologians
and
men
of
science
influenced
by
them
insisted
that
his
minimizing
of
geological
changes
and
his
laying
stress
on
the
gradual
action
of
natural
causes
still
in
force
endangered
the
sacred
record
of
creation
and
left
no
place
for
miraculous
intervention
and
when
it
was
found
that
he
had
entirely
cast
aside
their
cherished
idea
that
the
great
geological
changes
of
the
earth
surface
and
the
multitude
of
fossil
remains
were
due
to
the
deluge
of
noah
and
had
shown
that
a
far
longer
time
was
demanded
for
creation
than
any
which
could
possibly
be
deduced
from
the
old
testament
genealogies
and
chronicles
orthodox
indignation
burst
forth
violently
eminent
dignitaries
of
the
church
attacked
him
without
mercy
and
for
a
time
he
was
under
social
ostracism
as
this
availed
little
an
effort
was
made
on
the
scientific
side
to
crush
him
beneath
the
weighty
authority
of
cuvier
but
the
futility
of
this
effort
was
evident
when
it
was
found
that
thinking
men
would
no
longer
listen
to
cuvier
and
persisted
in
listening
to
lyell
the
great
orthodox
cuvier
theory
of
the
earth
became
at
once
so
discredited
in
the
estimation
of
men
of
science
that
no
new
edition
of
it
was
called
for
while
lyell
work
speedily
ran
through
twelve
editions
and
remained
a
firm
basis
of
modern
thought
for
buckland
and
the
various
forms
of
attack
upon
him
see
gordon
life
of
buckland
especially
pp
for
the
attack
on
lyell
and
his
book
see
huxley
the
lights
of
the
church
and
the
light
of
science
as
typical
of
his
more
moderate
opponents
we
may
take
fairholme
who
in
published
his
mosaic
deluge
and
argued
that
no
early
convulsions
of
the
earth
such
as
those
supposed
by
geologists
could
have
taken
place
because
there
could
have
been
no
deluge
before
moral
guilt
could
possibly
have
been
incurred
that
is
to
say
before
the
creation
of
mankind
in
touching
terms
he
bewailed
the
defection
of
the
president
of
the
geological
society
and
dean
buckland
protesting
against
geologists
who
persist
in
closing
their
eyes
upon
the
solemn
declarations
of
the
almighty
still
the
geologists
continued
to
seek
truth
the
germs
planted
especially
by
william
smith
the
father
of
english
geology
were
developed
by
a
noble
succession
of
investigators
and
the
victory
was
sure
meanwhile
those
theologians
who
felt
that
denunciation
of
science
as
godless
could
accomplish
little
laboured
upon
schemes
for
reconciling
geology
with
genesis
some
of
these
show
amazing
ingenuity
but
an
eminent
religious
authority
going
over
them
with
great
thoroughness
has
well
characterized
them
as
daring
and
fanciful
such
attempts
have
been
variously
classified
but
the
fact
regarding
them
all
is
that
each
mixes
up
more
or
less
of
science
with
more
or
less
of
scripture
and
produces
a
result
more
or
less
absurd
though
a
few
men
here
and
there
have
continued
these
exercises
the
capitulation
of
the
party
which
set
the
literal
account
of
the
deluge
of
noah
against
the
facts
revealed
by
geology
was
at
last
clearly
made
for
fairholme

very
just

reconciliation

the
final
philosophy
one
of
the
first
evidences
of
the
completeness
of
this
surrender
has
been
so
well
related
by
the
eminent
physiologist
carpenter
that
it
may
best
be
given
in
his
own
words
you
are
familiar
with
a
book
of
considerable
value
smith
dictionary
of
the
bible
i
happened
to
know
the
influences
under
which
that
dictionary
was
framed
the
idea
of
the
publisher
and
of
the
editor
was
to
give
as
much
scholarship
and
such
results
of
modern
criticism
as
should
be
compatible
with
a
very
judicious
conservatism
there
was
to
be
no
objection
to
geology
but
the
universality
of
the
deluge
was
to
be
strictly
maintained
the
editor
committed
the
article
deluge
to
a
man
of
very
considerable
ability
but
when
the
article
came
to
him
he
found
that
it
was
so
excessively
heretical
that
he
could
not
venture
to
put
it
in
there
was
not
time
for
a
second
article
under
that
head
and
if
you
look
in
that
dictionary
you
will
find
under
the
word
deluge
a
reference
to
flood
before
flood
came
a
second
article
had
been
commissioned
from
a
source
that
was
believed
safely
conservative
but
when
the
article
came
in
it
was
found
to
be
worse
than
the
first
a
third
article
was
then
commissioned
and
care
was
taken
to
secure
its
if
you
look
for
the
word
flood
in
the
dictionary
you
will
find
a
reference
to
noah
under
that
name
you
will
find
an
article
written
by
a
distinguished
professor
of
cambridge
of
which
i
remember
that
bishop
colenso
said
to
me
at
the
time
a
very
guarded
way
the
writer
concedes
the
whole
thing
you
will
see
by
this
under
what
trammels
scientific
thought
has
laboured
in
this
department
of
inquiry
see
official
report
of
the
national
conference
of
unitarian
and
other
christian
churches
held
at
saratoga
a
similar
surrender
was
seen
when
from
a
new
edition
of
introduction
to
the
scriptures
the
standard
textbook
of
orthodoxy
its
accustomed
use
of
fossils
to
prove
the
universality
of
the
deluge
was
quietly
dropped
this
was
about
see

early
history
of
mankind
a
like
capitulation
in
the
united
states
was
foreshadowed
in
when

eminent
professor
of
biblical
literature
and
interpretation
in
the
most
important
theological
seminary
of
the
protestant
episcopal
church
samuel
turner
showed
his
christian
faith
and
courage
by
virtually
accepting
the
new
view
and
the
old
contention
was
utterly
cast
away
by
the
thinking
men
of
another
great
religious
body
when
at
a
later
period
two
divines
among
the
most
eminent
for
piety
and
learning

inserted

from

that
the
deluge
of

was
not
universal

even
widely
extended

the
time
when
the
struggle
was
relinquished
by
enlightened
theologians
of
the
roman
catholic
church
may
be
fixed
at
about
when
reusch
professor
of
theology
at
bonn
in
his
work
on
the
bible
and
nature
cast
off
the
old
diluvial
theory

all
its
supporters
accepting
the
conclusions
of
science
see

chap
xxi
but
though
the
sacred
theory
with
the
deluge
of
noah
as
a
universal
solvent
for
geological
difficulties
was
evidently
dying
there
still
remained
in
various
quarters

touching
fidelity
to
it

even
farther
and
refused
to
allow
the
faithful
to
believe
that
any
change
had
taken
place
since
the
beginning
mentioned
in

hosts

a
phrase
apparently
pithy

really
hollow

declaration
that
modern
geology
observes
what
is
but
has
no
right
to
judge
concerning
the
beginning
of
things
as
late
as
zugler
took
a
similar
view
and
a
multitude
of
lesser
lights
through
pulpit
and
press
brought
these
antiscientific
doctrines
to
bear
upon
the
people
at
large
the
only
effect
being
to
arouse
grave
doubts
regarding
christianity
among
thoughtful
men
and
especially
among
young
men
who
naturally
distrusted
a
cause
using
such
weapons
for
just
at
this
time
the
traditional
view
of
the
deluge
received
its
and
in
a
manner
entirely
unexpected
by
the
investigations
of
george
smith
among
the
assyrian
tablets
of
the
british
museum
in
and
by
his
discoveries
just
afterward
in
assyria
it
was
put
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
a
great
mass
of
accounts
in
genesis
are
simply
adaptations
of
earlier
and
especially
of
chaldean
myths
and
legends
while
this
proved
to
be
the
fact
as
regards
the
accounts
of
creation
and
the
fall
of
man
it
was
seen
to
be
most
strikingly
so
as
regards
the
deluge
the
eleventh
of
the
twelve
tablets
on
which
the
most
important
of
these
inscriptions
was
found
was
almost
wholly
preserved
and
it
revealed
in
this
legend
dating
from
a
time
far
earlier
than
that
of
moses
such
features
peculiar
to
the
childhood
of
the
world
as
the
building
of
the
great
ship
or
ark
to
escape
the
flood
the
careful
caulking
of
its
seams
the
saving
of
a
man
beloved
of
heaven
his
selecting
and
taking
with
him
into
the
vessel
animals
of
all
sorts
in
couples
the
impressive
final
closing
of
the
door
the
sending
forth
different
birds
as
the
flood
abated
the
offering
of
sacrifices
when
the
flood
had
subsided
the
joy
of
the
divine
being
who
had
caused
the
flood
as
the
odour
of
the
sacrifice
reached
his
nostrils
while
throughout
all
was
shown
that
partiality
for
the
chaldean
sacred
number
seven
which
appears
so
constantly
in
the
genesis
legends
and
throughout
the
hebrew
sacred
books
other
devoted
scholars
followed
in
the
paths
thus
opened
sayce
in
england
lenormant
in
france
schrader
in
germany
with
the
result
that
the
hebrew
account
of
the
deluge
to
which
for
ages
theologians
had
obliged
all
geological
research
to
conform
was
quietly
relegated
even
by
most
eminent
christian
scholars
to
the
realm
of
myth
and
legend

and
and
elsewhere
sundry
feeble
attempts
to
break
the
force
of
this
discovery
and
an
evidently
widespread
fear
to
have
it
known
have
certainly
impaired
not
a
little
the
legitimate
influence
of
the
christian
clergy
and
yet
this
adoption
of
chaldean
myths
into
the
hebrew
scriptures
furnishes
one
of
the
strongest
arguments
for
the
value
of
our
bible
as
a
record
of
the
upward
growth
of
man
for
while
the
chaldean
legend
primarily
ascribes
the
deluge
to
the
mere
arbitrary
caprice
of
one
among
many
gods
bel
the
hebrew
development
of
the
legend
ascribes
it
to
the
justice
the
righteousness
of
the
supreme
god
thus
showing
the
evolution
of
a
higher
and
nobler
sentiment
which
demanded
a
moral
cause
adequate
to
justify
such
a
catastrophe
unfortunately
thus
far
save
in
a
few
of
the
broader
and
nobler
minds
among
the
clergy
the
policy
of
ignoring
such
new
revelations
has
prevailed
and
the
results
of
this
policy
both
in
roman
catholic
and
in
protestant
countries
are
not
far
to
seek
what
the
condition
of
thought
is
among
the
middle
classes
of
france
and
italy
needs
not
to
be
stated
here
in
germany
as
a
typical
fact
it
may
be
mentioned
that
there
was
in
the
year
church
accommodation
in
the
city
of
berlin
for
but
two
per
cent
of
the
population
and
that
even
this
accommodation
was
more
than
was
needed
this
fact
is
not
due
to
the
want
of
a
deep
religious
spirit
among
the
north
germans
no
one
who
has
lived
among
them
can
doubt
the
existence
of
such
a
spirit
but
it
is
due
mainly
to
the
fact
that
while
the
simple
results
of
scientific
investigation
have
filtered
down
among
the
people
at
large
the
dominant
party
in
the
lutheran
church
has
steadily
refused
to
recognise
this
fact
and
has
persisted
in
imposing
on
scripture
the
fetters
of
literal
and
dogmatic
interpretation
which
germany
has
largely
outgrown
a
similar
danger
threatens
every
other
country
in
which
the
clergy
pursue
a
similar
policy
no
thinking
man
whatever
may
be
his
religious
views
can
fail
to
regret
this
a
thoughtful
reverent
enlightened
clergy
is
a
great
blessing
to
any
country
and
anything
which
undermines
their
legitimate
work
of
leading
men
out
of
the
worship
of
material
things
to
the
consideration
of
that
which
is
highest
is
a
vast
misfortune
for
the
foregoing
statements
regarding
germany
the
writer
relies
on
his
personal
observation
as
a
student
at
the
university
of
berlin
in
as
a
traveller
at
various
periods
afterward
and
as
minister
of
the
united
states
in
and
iv
final
efforts
at
the
victory
of
science
complete
before
concluding
it
may
be
instructive
to
note
a
few
especially
desperate
attempts
at
truces
or
compromises
such
as
always
appear
when
the
victory
of
any
science
has
become
absolutely
sure
typical
among
the
earliest
of
these
may
be
mentioned
the
effort
of
carl
von
raumer
in
with
much
pretension
to
scientific
knowledge
but
with
aspirations
bounded
by
the
limits
of
prussian
orthodoxy
he
made
a
laboured
attempt
to
produce
a
statement
which
by
its
vagueness
haziness
and
depth
should
obscure
the
real
questions
at
issue
this
statement
appeared
in
the
shape
of
an
argument
used
by
bertrand
and
others
in
the
previous
century
to
prove
that
fossil
remains
of
plants
in
the
coal
measures
had
never
existed
as
living
plants
but
had
been
simply
a
result
of
the
development
of
imperfect
plant
embryos
and
the
same
misty
theory
was
suggested
to
explain
the
existence
of
fossil
animals
without
supposing
the
epochs
and
changes
required
by
geological
science
in
wagner
sought
to
uphold
this
explanation
but
it
was
so
clearly
a
mere
hollow
phrase
unable
to
bear
the
weight
of
the
facts
to
be
accounted
for
that
it
was
soon
given
up
similar
attempts
were
made
throughout
europe
the
most
noteworthy
appearing
in
england
in
was
issued
an
anonymous
work
having
as
its
title
a
brief
and
complete
refutation
of
the
theory
of
geologists
the
author
having
revived
an
old
idea
and
put
a
spark
of
life
into
it
this
idea
being
that
all
the
organisms
found
in
the
depths
of
the
earth
were
made
on
the
first
of
the
six
creative
days
as
models
for
the
plants
and
animals
to
be
created
on
the
third
fifth
and
sixth
days
see
zoeckler
vol
ii
but
while
these
attempts
to
preserve
the
old
theory
as
to
fossil
remains
of
lower
animals
were
thus
pressed
there
appeared
upon
the
geological
field
a
new
scientific
column
far
more
terrible
to
the
old
doctrines
than
any
which
had
been
seen
previously
for
just
at
the
close
of
the
first
quarter
of
the
nineteenth
century
geologists
began
to
examine
the
caves
and
beds
of
drift
in
various
parts
of
the
world
and
within
a
few
years
from
that
time
a
series
of
discoveries
began
in
france
in
belgium
in
england
in
brazil
in
sicily
in
india
in
egypt
and
in
america
which
established
the
fact
that
a
period
of
time
much
greater
than
any
which
had
before
been
thought
of
had
elapsed
since
the
first
human
occupation
of
the
earth
the
chronologies
of
archbishop
usher
petavius
bossuet
and
the
other
great
authorities
on
which
theology
had
securely
leaned
were
found
worthless
it
was
clearly
seen
that
no
matter
how
well
based
upon
the
old
testament
genealogies
and
lives
of
the
patriarchs
all
these
systems
must
go
for
nothing
the
most
conservative
geologists
were
gradually
obliged
to
admit
that
man
had
been
upon
the
earth
not
merely
six
thousand
or
sixty
thousand
or
one
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
years
and
when
in
sir
charles
lyell
in
his
book
on
the
antiquity
of
man
retracted
solemnly
his
earlier
view
yielding
with
a
reluctance
almost
pathetic
but
with
a
thoroughness
absolutely
convincing

last

of

the
supporters
of
a
theory
based
upon
the
letter
of

who
had
so
long
taken
the
offensive
were
now
obliged
to
fight
upon
the
defensive
and
at
fearful
odds
various
lines
of
defence
were
taken
but
perhaps
the
most
pathetic
effort
was
that
made
in
the
year
in
england
by
gosse
as
a
naturalist
he
had
rendered
great
services
to
zoological
science
but
he
now
concentrated
his
energies
upon
one
last
effort
to
save
the
literal
interpretation
of
genesis
and
the
theological
structure
built
upon
it
in
his
work
entitled
omphalos
he
developed
the
theory
previously
urged
by
granville
penn
and
asserted
a
new
principle
called
prochronism
in
accordance
with
this
all
things
were
created
by
the
almighty
hand
literally
within
the
six
days
each
made
up
of
the
evening
and
the
morning
and
each
great
branch
of
creation
was
brought
into
existence
in
an
instant
accepting
a
declaration
of
ure
that
neither
reason
nor
revelation
will
justify
us
in
extending
the
origin
of
the
material
system
beyond
six
thousand
years
from
our
own
days
gosse
held
that
all
the
evidences
of
convulsive
changes
and
long
epochs
in
strata
rocks
minerals
and
fossils
are
simply
appearances
only
that
and
nothing
more
among
these
mere
appearances
all
created
simultaneously
were
the
glacial
furrows
and
scratches
on
rocks
the
marks
of
retreat
on
rocky
masses
as
at
niagara
the
tilted
and
twisted
strata
the
piles
of
lava
from
extinct
volcanoes
the
fossils
of
every
sort
in
every
part
of
the
earth
the
of
birds
and
reptiles
the
remains
of
weaker
animals
found
in
the
fossilized
bodies
of
the
stronger
the
marks
of
hyenas
teeth
on
fossilized
bones
found
in
various
caves
and
even
the
skeleton
of
the
siberian
mammoth
at
petersburg
with
lumps
of
flesh
bearing
the
marks
of
teeth
all
these
with
all
gaps
and
imperfections
he
urged
mankind
to
believe
came
into
being
in
an
instant
the
preface
of
the
work
is
especially
touching
and
it
ends
with
the
prayer
that
science
and
scripture
may
be
reconciled
by
his
theory
and
that
the
god
of
truth
will
deign
so
to
use
it
and
if
he
do
to
him
be
all
the
glory
at
the
close
of
the
whole
book
gosse
declared
the
field
is
left
clear
and
undisputed
for
the
one
witness
on
the
opposite
side
whose
testimony
is
as
follows
six
days
jehovah
made
heaven
and
earth
the
sea
and
all
that
in
them
is
this
quotation
he
placed
in
capital
letters
as
the
final
refutation
of
all
that
the
science
of
geology
had
built

desperate
attempts
were
made
even
later
to
save
the
letter
of
our
sacred
books
by
the
revival
of
a
theory
in
some
respects
more
striking

shape
this
theory

of

mixture
thus
obtained
schubert
developed
the
idea
that
the
satanic
principalities
and
powers
formerly
inhabiting
our
universe
plunged
it
into
the
chaos
from
which
it
was
newly
created
by
a
process
accurately
described
in

rougemont
made
the
earth
one
of

morning
stars
of
job
reduced
to
chaos
by
lucifer
and
his
followers
and
thence
developed
in
accordance
with
the
nebular
hypothesis
kurtz
evolved
from
this
theory
an
opinion
that
the
geological
disturbances
were
caused
by
the
opposition
of
the
devil
to
the
rescue
of

universe

chaos

the
almighty
delitzsch
put
a
similar
idea
into

more
scholastic
jargon

most
desperate
of
all
were
the
statements
of
anton
westermeyer
of
munich
in
the
old
testament
vindicated
from
modern
infidel
objections
the
following
passage
will
serve
to
show
his
ideas

fructifying
brooding
of

divine

inhabited

that
they
were
to
be
driven
from
their
possessions
or
at
least
that
their
place
of
habitation
was
to
be
contracted
and
they
therefore
tried
to
frustrate
god
plan
of
creation
and
exert
all
that
remained
to
them
of
might
and
power
to
hinder
or
at

to
mar
the
new
creation
so
came
into
being
the
horrible
and
destructive
monsters
these
caricatures
and
distortions
of
creation
of
which
we
have
fossil
remains
westermeyer
goes
on
to
insist
that
whole
generations
called
into
existence
by
god
succumbed
to
the
corruption
of
the
devil
and
for
that
reason
had
to
be
destroyed
and
that
in
the
work
of
the
six
days
god
caused
the
devil
to
feel
his
power

such
was
the
last
important
assault
upon
the
strongholds
of
geological
science
in
germany
and
in
view
of
this
and
others
of
the
same
kind
it
is
little
to
be
wondered
at
that
when
in
johann
silberschlag
made
an
attempt
to
again
base
geology
upon
the
deluge
of
noah
he
found
such
difficulties
that
in
a
touching
passage
he
expressed
a
desire
to
get
back
to
the
theory
that
fossils
were
sports
of
nature
see
reusch
vol
i
but
the
most
noted
among
efforts
to
keep
geology
well
within
the
letter
of
scripture
is
of
still
more
recent
date
in
the
year
gladstone
found
time
amid
all
his
labours
and
cares
as
the
greatest
parliamentary
leader
in
england
to
take
the
field
in
the
struggle
for
the
letter
of
genesis
against
geology
on
the
face
of
it
his
effort
seemed
quixotic
for
he
confessed
at
the
outset
that
in
science
he
was
utterly
destitute
of
that
kind
of
knowledge
which
carries
authority
and
his
argument
soon
showed
that
this
confession
was
entirely
true
but
he
had
some
other
qualities
of
which
much
might
be
expected
great
skill
in
great
shrewdness
in
adapting
the
meanings
of
single
words
to
conflicting
necessities
in
discussion
wonderful
power
in
erecting
showy
structures
of
argument
upon
the
smallest
basis
of
fact
and
a
facility
almost
preternatural
in
explaining
away
troublesome
realities
so
striking
was
his
power
in
this
last
respect
that
a
humorous
london
chronicler
once
advised
a
bigamist
as
his
only
hope
to
induce
gladstone
to
explain
away
one
of
his
wives
at
the
basis
of
this
structure
gladstone
placed
what
he
found
in
the
text
of
genesis
a
grand
fourfold
division
of
animated
nature
set
forth
in
an
orderly
succession
of
times
and
he
arranged
this
order
and
succession
of
creation
as
follows
first
the
water
population
secondly
the
air
population
thirdly
the
land
population
of
animals
fourthly
the
land
population
consummated
in
man
his
next
step
was
to
slide
in
upon
this
basis
the
apparently
harmless
proposition
that
this
division
and
sequence
is
understood
to
have
been
so
affirmed
in
our
time
by
natural
science
that
it
may
be
taken
as
a
demonstrated
conclusion
and
established
fact
finally
upon
these
foundations
he
proceeded
to
build
an
argument
out
of
the
coincidences
thus
secured
between
the
record
in
the
hebrew
sacred
books
and
the
truths
revealed
by
science
as
regards
this
order
and
sequence
and
he
easily
arrived
at
the
desired
conclusion
with
which
he
crowned
the
whole
structure
namely
as
regards
the
writer
of
genesis
that
his
knowledge
was
divine

reply

was
the
skeleton
of

structure

was
abundantly
decorated

the
rhetoric
in
which
gladstone
is
so
skilful
an
artificer

above

the
scientific
questions
concerned
took
up
the
matter
gladstone
first
proposition
that
the
sacred
writings
give
us
a
great
fourfold
division
created
in
an
orderly
succession
of
times
huxley
did
not
presume
to
gainsay
as
to
gladstone
second
proposition
that
this
great
fourfold
division
created
in
an
orderly
succession
of
times
has
been
so
affirmed
in
our
own
time
by
natural
science
that
it
may
be
taken
as
a
demonstrated
conclusion
and
established
fact
huxley
showed
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
no
such
fourfold
division
and
orderly
succession
exist
that
so
far
from
establishing
assumption
that
the
population
of
water
air
and
land
followed
each
other
in
the
order
given
all
the
evidence
we
possess
goes
to
prove
that
they
did
not
that
the
distribution
of
fossils
through
the
various
strata
proves
that
some
land
animals
originated
before
sea
animals
that
there
has
been
a
mixing
of
sea
land
and
air
population
utterly
destructive
to
the
great
fourfold
division
and
to
the
creation
in
an
orderly
succession
of
times
that
so
far
is
the
view
presented
in
the
sacred
text
as
stated
by
gladstone
from
having
been
so
affirmed
in
our
own
time
by
natural
science
that
it
may
be
taken
as
a
demonstrated
conclusion
and
established
fact
that
assertion
is
directly
contradictory
to
facts
known
to
every
one
who
is
acquainted
with
the
elements
of
natural
science
that
only
geological
authority
cuvier
had
died
more
than
fifty
years
before
when
geological
science
was
in
its
infancy
and
he
might
have
added
when
it
was
necessary
to
make
every
possible
concession
to
the
church
and
finally
he
challenged
gladstone
to
produce
any
contemporary
authority
in
geological
science
who
would
support
his
scriptural
view
and
when
in
a
rejoinder
gladstone
attempted
to
support
his
view
on
the
authority
of
dana
huxley
had
no
difficulty
in
showing
from
dana
works
that
gladstone
inference
was
utterly
unfounded
but
while
the
fabric
reared
by
gladstone
had
been
thus
undermined
by
huxley
on
the
scientific
side
another
opponent
began
an
attack
from
the
biblical
side
the
rev
canon
driver
professor
at
gladstone
own
university
of
oxford
took
up
the
question
in
the
light
of
scriptural
interpretation
in
regard
to
the
comparative
table
drawn
up
by
sir
dawson
showing
the
supposed
correspondence
between
the
scriptural
and
the
geological
order
of
creation
canon
driver
said
the
two
series
are
evidently
at
variance
the
geological
record
contains
no
evidence
of
clearly
defined
periods
corresponding
to
the
of
genesis
in
genesis
vegetation
is
complete
two
days
before
animal
life
appears
geology
shows
that
they
appear
simultaneously
even
if
animal
life
does
not
appear
first
in
genesis
birds
appear
together
with
aquatic
creatures
and
precede
all
land
animals
according
to
the
evidence
of
geology
birds
are
unknown
till
a
period
much
later
than
that
at
which
aquatic
creatures
including
fishes
and
amphibia
abound
and
they
are
preceded
by
numerous
species
of
land
animals
in
particular
by
insects
and
other
things
of
the
mosaic
account
of
the
existence
of
vegetation
before
the
creation
of
the
sun
canon
driver
said
no
reconciliation
of
this
representation
with
the
data
of
science
has
yet
been
found
and
again
from
all
that
has
been
said
however
reluctant
we
may
be
to
make
the
admission
only
one
conclusion
seems
possible
read
without
prejudice
or
bias
the
narrative
of
genesis
i
creates
an
impression
at
variance
with
the
facts
revealed
by
science
the
eminent
professor
ends
by
saying
that
the
efforts
at
reconciliation
are
different
modes
of
obliterating
the
characteristic
features
of
genesis
and
of
reading
into
it
a
view
which
it
does
not
express
thus
fell
gladstone
fabric
of
coincidences
between
the
great
fourfold
division
in
genesis
and
the
facts
ascertained
by
geology
huxley
had
shattered
the
scientific
parts
of
the
structure
driver
had
removed
its
biblical
foundations
and
the
last
great
fortress
of
the
opponents
of
unfettered
scientific
investigation
was
in
ruins
in
opposition
to
all
such
attempts
we
may
put
a
noble
utterance
by
a
clergyman
who
has
probably
done
more
to
save
what
is
essential
in
christianity
among
people
than
any
other
ecclesiastic
of
his
time
the
late
dean
of
westminster
arthur
stanley
was
widely
known
and
beloved
on
both
continents
in
his
memorial
sermon
after
the
funeral
of
sir
charles
lyell
he
said
it
is
now
clear
to
diligent
students
of
the
bible
that
the
first
and
second
chapters
of
genesis
contain
two
narratives
of
the
creation
side
by
side
differing
from
each
other
in
almost
every
particular
of
time
and
place
and
order
it
is
well
known
that
when
the
science
of
geology
first
arose
it
was
involved
in
endless
schemes
of
attempted
reconciliation
with
the
letter
of
scripture
there
were
there
are
perhaps
still
two
modes
of
reconciliation
of
scripture
and
science
which
have
been
each
in
their
day
attempted
and
each
has
totally
and
deservedly
failed
one
is
the
endeavour
to
wrest
the
words
of
the
bible
from
their
natural
meaning
and
force
it
to
speak
the
language
of
science
and
again
speaking
of
the
earliest
known
example
which
was
the
interpolation
of
the
word
not
in
leviticus
xi
he
continues
this
is
the
earliest
instance
of
the
falsification
of
scripture
to
meet
the
demands
of
science
and
it
has
been
followed
in
later
times
by
the
various
efforts
which
have
been
made
to
twist
the
earlier
chapters
of
the
book
of
genesis
into
apparent
agreement
with
the
last
results
of
geology
representing
days
not
to
be
days
morning
and
evening
not
to
be
morning
and
evening
the
deluge
not
to
be
the
deluge
and
the
ark
not
to
be
the
ark
after
a
statement
like
this
we
may
fitly
ask
which
is
the
more
likely
to
strengthen
christianity
for
its
work
in
the
twentieth
century
which
we
are
now
about
to
enter
a
large
manly
honest
fearless
utterance
like
this
of
arthur
stanley
or
sophistries
bearing
in
their
every
line
the
germs
of
failure
like
those
attempted
by
gladstone
the
world
is
finding
that
the
scientific
revelation
of
creation
is
ever
more
and
more
in
accordance
with
worthy
conceptions
of
that
great
power
working
in
and
through
the
universe
more
and
more
it
is
seen
that
inspiration
has
never
ceased
and
that
its
prophets
and
priests
are
not
those
who
work
to
fit
the
letter
of
its
older
literature
to
the
needs
of
dogmas
and
sects
but
those
above
all
others
who
patiently
fearlessly
and
reverently
devote
themselves
to
the
search
for
truth
as
truth
in
the
faith
that
there
is
a
power
in
the
universe
wise
enough
to
make
safe
and
good
enough
to
make
useful
for
the
controversy
see
the
nineteenth
century
for
for
canon
driver

his
article

cosmogony

genesis

expositor

egyptology
and
assyriology
i
the
sacred
chronology
in
the
great
ranges
of
investigation
which
bear
most
directly
upon
the
origin
of
man
there
are
two
in
which
science
within
the
last
few
years
has
gained
final
victories
the
significance
of
these
in
changing
and
ultimately
in
reversing
one
of
the
greatest
currents
of
theological
thought
can
hardly
be
overestimated
not
even
the
tide
set
in
motion
by
cusa
copernicus
and
galileo
was
more
powerful
to
bring
in
a
new
epoch
of
belief
the
first
of
these
conquests
relates
to
the
antiquity
of
man
on
the
earth
the
fathers
of
the
early
christian
church
receiving
all
parts
of
our
sacred
books
as
equally
inspired
laid
little
if
any
less
stress
on
the
myths
legends
genealogies
and
tribal
family
and
personal
traditions
contained
in
the
old
and
the
new
testaments
than
upon
the
most
powerful
appeals
the
most
instructive
apologues
and
the
most
lofty
poems
of
prophets
psalmists
and
apostles
as
to
the
age
of
our
planet
and
the
life
of
man
upon
it
they
found
in
the
bible
a
carefully
recorded
series
of
periods
extending
from
adam
to
the
building
of
the
temple
at
jerusalem
the
length
of
each
period
being
explicitly
given
thus
they
had
a
biblical
chronology
full
consecutive
and
definite
extending
from
the
first
man
created
to
an
event
of
known
date
well
within
ascertained
profane
history
as
a
result
the
early
christian
commentators
arrived
at
conclusions
varying
somewhat
but
in
the
main
agreeing
some
like
origen
eusebius
lactantius
clement
of
alexandria
and
the
great
fathers
generally
of
the
first
three
centuries
dwelling
especially
upon
the
septuagint
version
of
the
scriptures
thought
that
man
creation
took
place
about
six
thousand
years
before
the
christian
era
strong
confirmation
of
this
view
was
found
in
a
simple
piece
of
purely
theological
reasoning
for
just
as
the
seven
candlesticks
of
the
apocalypse
were
long
held
to
prove
the
existence
of
seven
heavenly
bodies
revolving
about
the
earth
so
it
was
felt
that
the
six
days
of
creation
prefigured
six
thousand
years
during
which
the
earth
in
its
first
form
was
to
endure
and
that
as
the
first
adam
came
on
the
sixth
day
christ
the
second
adam
had
come
at
the
sixth
millennial
period
theophilus
bishop
of
antioch
in
the
second
century
clinched
this
argument
with
the
text
one
day
is
with
the
lord
as
a
thousand
years
on
the
other
hand
eusebius
and
jerome
dwelling
more
especially
upon
the
hebrew
text
which
we
are
brought
up
to
revere
thought
that
man
origin
took
place
at
a
somewhat
shorter
period
before
the
christian
era
and
jerome
overwhelming
authority
made
this
the
dominant
view
throughout
western
europe
during
fifteen
centuries
the
simplicity
of
these
great
fathers
as
regards
chronology
is
especially
reflected
from
the
tables
of
eusebius
in
these
moses
joshua
and
bacchus
deborah
orpheus
and
the
amazons
abimelech
the
sphinx
and
oedipus
appear
together
as
personages
equally
real
and
their
positions
in
chronology
equally
ascertained
at
times
great
bitterness
was
aroused
between
those
holding
the
longer
and
those
holding
the
shorter
chronology
but
after
all
the
difference
between
them
as
we
now
see
was
trivial
and
it
may
be
broadly
stated
that
in
the
early
church
always
everywhere
and
by
all
it
was
held
as
certain
upon
the
absolute
warrant
of
scripture
that
man
was
created
from
four
to
six
thousand
years
before
the
christian
era
to
doubt
this
and
even
much
less
than
this
was
to
risk
damnation
augustine
insisted
that
belief
in
the
antipodes
and
in
the
longer
duration
of
the
earth
than
six
thousand
years
were
deadly
heresies
equally
hostile
to
scripture
philastrius
the
friend
of
ambrose
and
augustine
whose
fearful
catalogue
of
heresies
served
as
a
guide
to
intolerance
throughout
the
middle
ages
condemned
with
the
same
holy
horror
those
who
expressed
doubt
as
to
the
orthodox
number
of
years
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
and
those
who
doubted
an
earthquake
to
be
the
literal
voice
of
an
angry
god
or
who
questioned
the
plurality
of
the
heavens
or
who
gainsaid
the
statement
that
god
brings
out
the
stars
from
his
treasures
and
hangs
them
up
in
the
solid
firmament
above
the
earth
every
night
about
the
beginning
of
the
seventh
century
isidore
of
seville
the
great
theologian
of
his
time
took
up
the
subject
he
accepted
the
dominant
view
not
only
of
hebrew
but
of
all
other
chronologies
without
anything
like
real
criticism
the
childlike
faith
of
his
system
may
be
imagined
from
his
summaries
which
follow
he
tells
us
joseph

reasoning
in
this
general
way
isidore
kept
well
under
the
longer
date
and
the
great
theological
authority
of
southern
europe
having
thus
spoken
the
question
was
virtually
at
rest
throughout
christendom
for
nearly
a
hundred
years
early
in
the
eighth
century
the
venerable
bede
took
up
the
problem
dwelling
especially
upon
the
received
hebrew
text
of
the
old
testament
he
soon
entangled
himself
in
very
serious
difficulties
but
in
spite
of
the
great
fathers
of
the
first
three
centuries
he
reduced
the
antiquity
of
man
on
the
earth
by
nearly
a
thousand
years
and
in
spite
of
mutterings
against
him
as
coming
dangerously
near
a
limit
which
made
the
theological
argument
from
the
six
days
of
creation
to
the
six
ages
of
the
world
look
doubtful
his
authority
had
great
weight
and
did
much
to
fix
western
europe
in
its
allegiance
to
the
general
system
laid
down
by
eusebius
and
jerome
in
the
twelfth
century
this
belief
was
by
a
tide
of
thought
from
a
very
different
quarter
rabbi
moses
maimonides
and
other
jewish
scholars
by
careful
study
of
the
hebrew
text
arrived
at
conclusions
diminishing
the
antiquity
of
man
still
further
and
thus
gave
strength
throughout
the
middle
ages
to
the
shorter
chronology
it
was
incorporated
into
the
sacred
science
of
christianity
and

at
the

this

was
not
disturbed
the

manner
of
accepting
the
sacred
text
which
led
luther
melanchthon
and
the
great
protestant
leaders
generally
to
oppose
the
copernican
theory
fixed
them
firmly
in
this
biblical
chronology
the
keynote
was
sounded
for
them
by
luther
when
he
said
we
know
on
the
authority
of
moses
that
longer
ago
than
six
thousand
years
the
world
did
not
exist
melanchthon
more
exact
fixed
the
creation
of
man
at
but
the
great
christian
scholars
continued
the
old
endeavour
to
make
the
time
of
man
origin
more
precise
there
seems
to
have
been
a
sort
of
fascination
in
the
subject
which
developed
a
long
array
of
chronologists
all
weighing
the
minutest
indications
in
our
sacred
books
until
the
protestant
divine
de
vignolles
who
had
given
forty
years
to
the
study
of
biblical
chronology
declared
in
that
he
had
gathered
no
less
than
two
hundred
computations
based
upon
scripture
and
no
two
alike
as
to
the
roman
church
about
there
was
published
by
authority
of
pope
gregory
xiii
the
roman
martyrology
and
this
both
as
originally
published
and
as
revised
in
under
pope
urban
viii
declared
that
the
creation
of
man
took
place
years
before
christ
but
of
all
who
gave
themselves
up
to
these
chronological
studies
the
man
who
exerted
the
most
powerful
influence
upon
the
dominant
nations
of
christendom
was
archbishop
usher
in
he
published
his
annals
of
the
ancient
and
new
testaments
and
it
at
once
became
the
greatest
authority
for
all
peoples
usher
was
a
man
of
deep
and
wide
theological
learning
powerful
in
controversy
and
his
careful
conclusion
after
years
of
the
most
profound
study
of
the
hebrew
scriptures
was
that
man
was
created
years
before
the
christian
era
his
verdict
was
widely
received
as
final
his
dates
were
inserted
in
the
margins
of
the
authorized
version
of
the
english
bible
and
were
soon
practically
regarded
as
equally
inspired
with
the
sacred
text
itself
to
question
them
seriously
was
to
risk
preferment
in
the
church
and
reputation
in
the
world
at
large
the
same
adhesion
to
the
hebrew
scriptures
which
had
influenced
usher
brought
leading
men
of
the
older
church
to
the
same
view
men
who
would
have
burned
each
other
at
the
stake
for
their
differences
on
other
points
agreed
on
this
melanchthon
and
tostatus
lightfoot
and
jansen
salmeron
and
scaliger
petavius
and
kepler
inquisitors
and
reformers
jesuits
and
jansenists
priests
and
rabbis
stood
together
in
the
belief
that
the
creation
of
man
was
proved
by
scripture
to
have
taken
place
between
and
years
before
christ
in
spite
of
the
severe
pressure
of
this
line
of
authorities
extending
from
jerome
and
eusebius
to
usher
and
petavius
in
favour
of
this
scriptural
chronology
even
devoted
christian
scholars
had
sometimes
felt
obliged
to
revolt
the
first
great
source
of
difficulty
was
increased
knowledge
regarding
the
egyptian
monuments
as
far
back
as
the
last
years
of
the
sixteenth
century
joseph
scaliger
had
done
what
he
could
to
lay
the
foundations
of
a
more
scientific
treatment
of
chronology
insisting
especially
that
the
historical
indications
in
persia
in
babylon
and
above
all
in
egypt
should
be
brought
to
bear
on
the
question
more
than
that
he
had
the
boldness
to
urge
that
the
chronological
indications
of
the
hebrew
scriptures
should
be
fully
and
critically
discussed
in
the
light
of
egyptian
and
other
records
without
any
undue
bias
from
theological
considerations
his
idea
may
well
be
called
inspired
yet
it
had
little
effect
as
regards
a
true
view
of
the
antiquity
of
man
even
upon
himself
for
the
theological
bias
prevailed
above
all
his
reasonings
even
in
his
own
mind
well
does
a
brilliant
modern
writer
declare
that
among
the
multitude
of
strong
men
in
modern
times
abdicating
their
reason
at
the
command
of
their
prejudices
joseph
scaliger
is
perhaps
the
most
striking
example
early
in
the
following
century
sir
walter
raleigh
in
his
history
of
the
world
pointed
out
the
danger
of
adhering
to
the
old
system
he
too
foresaw
one
of
the
results
of
modern
investigation
stating
it
in
these
words
which
have
the
ring
of
prophetic
inspiration
for
in
abraham
time
all
the
then
known
parts
of
the
world
were
developed
egypt
had
many
magnificent
cities
and
these
not
built
with
sticks
but
of
hewn
stone
which
magnificence
needed
a
parent
of
more
antiquity
than
these
other
men
have
supposed
in
view
of
these
considerations
raleigh
followed
the
chronology
of
the
septuagint
version
which
enabled
him
to
give
to
the
human
race
a
few
more
years
than
were
usually
allowed
about
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
isaac
vossius
one
of
the
most
eminent
scholars
of
christendom
attempted
to
bring
the
prevailing
belief
into
closer
accordance
with
ascertained
facts
but
save
by
a
chosen
few
his
efforts
were
rejected
in
some
parts
of
europe
a
man
holding
new
views
on
chronology
was
by
no
means
safe
from
bodily
harm
as
an
example
of
the
extreme
pressure
exerted
by
the
old
theological
system
at
times
upon
honest
scholars
we
may
take
the
case
of
la
peyrere
who
about
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
put
forth
his
book
on
the
an
attempt
to
reconcile
sundry
difficulties
in
scripture
by
claiming
that
man
existed
on
earth
before
the
time
of
adam
he
was
taken
in
hand
at
once
great
theologians
rushed
forward
to
attack
him
from
all
parts
of
europe
within
fifty
years
different
refutations
of
his
arguments
had
appeared
the
parliament
of
paris
burned
the
book
and
the
grand
vicar
of
the
archdiocese
of
mechlin
threw
him
into
prison
and
kept
him
there
until
he
was
forced
not
only
to
retract
his
statements
but
to
abjure
his
protestantism
in
england
opposition
to
the
growing
truth
was
hardly
less
earnest
especially
strong
was
pearson
afterward
master
of
trinity
and
bishop
of
chester
in
his
treatise
on
the
creed
published
in
which
has
remained
a
theologic
classic
he
condemned
those
who
held
the
earth
to
be
more
than
hundred
years
old
insisted
that
the
first
man
was
created
just
six
days
later
declared
that
the
egyptian
records
were
forged
and
called
all
christians
to
turn
from
them
to
the
infallible
annals
of
the
spirit
of
god
but
in
spite
of
warnings
like
these
we
see
the
new
idea
cropping
out
in
various
parts
of
europe
in
sir
john
marsham
published
a
work
in
which
he
showed
himself
bold
and
honest
after
describing
the
heathen
sources
of
oriental
history
he
turns
to
the
christian
writers
and
having
used
the
history
of
egypt
to
show
that
the
great
church
authorities
were
not
exact
he
ends
one
important
argument
with
the
following
words
thus
the
most
interesting
antiquities
of
egypt
have
been
involved
in
the
deepest
obscurity
by
the
very
interpreters
of
her
chronology
who
have
jumbled
everything
up
qui
omnia
susque
deque
permiscuerunt
so
as
to
make
them
match
with
their
own
reckonings
of
hebrew
chronology
truly
a
very
bad
example
and
quite
unworthy
of
religious
writers
this
sturdy
protest
of
sir
john
against
the
dominant
system
and
against
the
jumbling
by
which
eusebius
had
endeavoured
to
cut
down
ancient
chronology
within
safe
and
sound
orthodox
limits
had
little
effect
though
eminent
chronologists
of
the
eighteenth
century
like
jackson
hales
and
drummond
gave
forth
multitudes
of
ponderous
volumes
pleading
for
a
period
somewhat
longer
than
that
generally
allowed
and
insisting
that
the
received
hebrew
text
was
grossly
vitiated
as
regards
chronology
even
this
poor
favour
was
refused
them
the
mass
of
believers
found
it
more
comfortable
to
hold
fast
the
faith
committed
to
them
by
usher
and
it
remained
settled
that
man
was
created
about
four
thousand
years
before
our
era
to
those
who
wished
even
greater
precision
john
lightfoot
of
the
university
of
cambridge
the
great
rabbinical
scholar
of
his
time
gave
his
famous
demonstration
from
our
sacred
books
that
heaven
and
earth
centre
and
circumference
were
created
together
in
the
same
instant
and
clouds
full
of
water
and
that
this
work
took
place
and
man
was
created
by
the
trinity
on
the
of
october
at
nine
in
the
morning
this
tide
of
theological
reasoning
rolled
on
through
the
eighteenth
century
swollen
by
the
biblical
researches
of
leading
commentators
catholic
and
protestant
until
it
came
in
much
majesty
and
force
into
our
own
nineteenth
century
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
century
it
gained
new
strength
from
various
great
men
in
the
church
among
whom
may
be
especially
named
adam
clarke
who
declared
that
to
preclude
the
possibility
of
a
mistake
the
unerring
spirit
of
god
directed
moses
in
the
selection
of
his
facts
and
the
ascertaining
of
his
dates
all
opposition
to
the
received
view
seemed
broken
down
and
as
late
as
indeed
as
late
as
came
an
announcement
in
the
work
of
one
of
the
most
eminent
egyptologists
sir
wilkinson
to
the
effect
that
he
had
modified
the
results
he
had
obtained

the
new
chronology
but
all
investigators
were
not
so
docile
as
wilkinson
and
there
soon
came
a
new
train
of
scientific
thought
which
rapidly
undermined
all
this
theological
chronology
not
to
speak
of
other
noted
men
we
have
early
in
the
present
century
young
champollion
and
rosellini
beginning
a
new
epoch
in
the
study
of
the
egyptian
monuments
nothing
could
be
more
cautious
than
their
procedure
but
the
evidence
was
soon
overwhelming
in
favour
of
a
vastly
longer
existence
of
man
in
the
nile
valley
than
could
be
made
to
agree
with
even
the
longest
duration
then
allowed
by
theologians
for
in
spite
of
all
the
suppleness
of
men
like
wilkinson
it
became
evident
that
whatever
system
of
scriptural
chronology
was
adopted
egypt
was
the
seat
of
a
flourishing
civilization
at
a
period
before
the
flood
of
noah
and
that
no
such
flood
had
ever
interrupted
it
this
was
bad
but
worse
remained
behind
it
was
soon
clear
that
the
civilization
of
egypt
began
earlier
than
the
time
assigned
for
the
creation
of
man
even
according
to
the
most
liberal
of
the
sacred
chronologists
as
time
went
on
this
became
more
and
more
evident
the
long
duration
assigned
to
human
civilization
in
the
fragments
of
manetho
the
egyptian
scribe
at
thebes
in
the
third
century
was
discovered
to
be
more
accordant
with
truth
than
the
chronologies
of
the
great
theologians
and
as
the
present
century
has
gone
on
scientific
results
have
been
reached
absolutely
fatal
to
the
chronological
view
based
by
the
universal
church
upon
scripture
for
nearly
two
thousand
years
as
is
well
known
the
first
of
the
egyptian
kings
of
whom
mention
is
made
upon
the
monuments
of
the
nile
valley
is
mena
or
menes
manetho
had
given
a
statement
according
to
which
mena
must
have
lived
nearly
six
thousand
years
before
the
christian
era
this
was
looked
upon
for
a
long
time
as
utterly
inadmissible
as
it
was
so
clearly
at
variance
with
the
chronology
of
our
own
sacred
books
but
as
time
went
on
large
fragments
of
the
original
work
of
manetho
were
more
carefully
studied
and
distinguished
from
corrupt
transcriptions
the
lists
of
kings
at
karnak
sacquarah
and
the
two
temples
at
abydos
were
brought
to
light
and
the
lists
of
court
architects
were
discovered
among
all
these
monuments
the
scholar
who
visits
egypt
is
most
impressed
by
the
sculptured
tablets
giving
the
lists
of
kings
each
shows
the
monarch
of
the
period
doing
homage
to
the
long
line
of
his
ancestors
each
of
these
sculptured
monarchs
has
near
him
a
tablet
bearing
his
name
that
great
care
was
always
taken
to
keep
these
imposing
records
correct
is
certain
the
loyalty
of
subjects
the
devotion
of
priests
and
the
family
pride
of
kings
were
all
combined
in
this
and
how
effective
this
care
was
is
seen
in
the
fact
that
kings
now
known
to
be
usurpers
are
carefully
omitted
the
lists
of
court
architects
extending
over
the
period
from
seti
to
darius
throw
a
flood
of
light
over
the
other
records
comparing
then
all
these
sources
and
applying
an
average
from
the
lengths
of
the
long
series
of
reigns
to
the
reigns
preceding
the
most
careful
and
cautious
scholars
have
satisfied
themselves
that
the
original
fragments
of
manetho
represent
the
work
of
a
man
honest
and
well
informed
and
after
making
all
allowances
for
discrepancies
and
the
overlapping
of
reigns
it
has
become
clear
that
the
period
known
as
the
reign
of
mena
must
be
fixed
at
more
than
three
thousand
years
in
this
the
great
egyptologists
of
our
time
concur
mariette
the
eminent
french
authority
puts
the
date
at
brugsch
the
leading
german
authority
puts
it
at
about
and
meyer
the
latest
and
most
cautious
of
the
historians
of
antiquity
declares
the
latest
possible
date
that
can
be
assigned
it
with
these
dates
the
foremost
english
authorities
sayce
and
flinders
petrie
substantially
agree
this
view
is
also
confirmed
on
astronomical
grounds
by
lockyer
the
astronomer
royal
we
have
it
then
as
the
result
of
a
century
of
work
by
the
most
acute
and
trained
egyptologists
and
with
the
inscriptions
upon
the
temples
and
papyri
before
them
both
of
which
are
now
read
with
as
much
facility
as
many
medieval
manuscripts
that
the
reign
of
mena
must
be
placed
more
than
five
thousand
years
ago
but
the
significance
of
this
conclusion
can
not
be
fully
understood
until
we
bring
into
connection
with
it
some
other
facts
revealed
by
the
egyptian
monuments
the
first
of
these
is
that
which
struck
sir
walter
raleigh
that
even
in
the
time
of
the
first
dynasties
in
the
nile
valley
a
high
civilization
had
already
been
developed
take
first
man
himself
we
find
sculptured
upon
the
early
monuments
types
of
the
various
races
egyptians
israelites
negroes
and
libyans
as
clearly
distinguishable
in
these
paintings
and
sculptures
of
from
four
to
six
thousand
years
ago
as
the
same
types
are
at
the
present
day
no
one
can
look
at
these
sculptures
upon
the
egyptian
monuments
or
even
the
drawings
of
them
as
given
by
lepsius
or
prisse
d
avennes
without
being
convinced
that
they
indicate
even
at
that
remote
period
a
difference
of
races
so
marked
that
long
previous
ages
must
have
been
required
to
produce
it
the
social
condition
of
egypt
revealed
in
these
early
monuments
of
art
forces
us
to
the
same
conclusion
those
earliest
monuments
show
that
a
very
complex
society
had
even
then
been
developed
we
not
only
have
a
separation
between
the
priestly
and
military
orders
but
agriculturists
manufacturers
and
traders
with
a
whole
series
of
subdivisions
in
each
of
these
classes
the
early
tombs
show
us
sculptured
and
painted
representations
of
a
daily
life
which
even
then
had
been
developed
into
a
vast
wealth
and
variety
of
grades
forms
and
usages
take
next
the
political
and
military
condition
one
fact
out
of
many
reveals
a
policy
which
must
have
been
the
result
of
long
experience
just
as
now
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
british
government
having
found
that
they
can
not
rely
upon
the
native
egyptians
for
the
protection
of
the
country
are
drilling
the
negroes
from
the
interior
of
africa
as
soldiers
so
the
celebrated
inscription
of
prince
una
as
far
back
as
the
sixth
dynasty
speaks
of
the
maksi
or
negroes
levied
and
drilled
by
tens
of
thousands
for
the
egyptian
army
take
next
engineering
here
we
find
very
early
operations
in
the
way
of
canals
dikes
and
great
public
edifices
so
bold
in
conception
and
thorough
in
execution
as
to
fill
our
greatest
engineers
of
these
days
with
astonishment
the
quarrying
conveyance
cutting
jointing
and
polishing
of
the
enormous
blocks
in
the
interior
of
the
great
pyramid
alone
are
the
marvel
of
the
foremost
of
our
century
as
regards
architecture
we
find
not
only
the
pyramids
which
date
from
the
very
earliest
period
of
egyptian
history
and
which
are
to
this
hour
the
wonder
of
the
world
for
size
for
boldness
for
exactness
and
for
skilful
contrivance
but
also
the
temples
with
long
ranges
of
colossal
columns
wrought
in
polished
granite
with
wonderful
beauty
of
ornamentation
with
architraves
and
roofs
vast
in
size
and
exquisite
in
adjustment
which
by
their
proportions
tax
the
imagination
and
lead
the
beholder
to
ask
whether
all
this
can
be
real
as
to
sculpture
we
have
not
only
the
great
sphinx
of
gizeh
so
marvellous
in
its
boldness
and
dignity
dating
from
the
very
first
period
of
egyptian
history
but
we
have
ranges
of
sphinxes
heroic
statues
and
showing
that
even
in
the
early
ages
this
branch
of
art
had
reached
an
amazing
development
as

the
perfection
of
these
lubke
the
most
eminent
german
authority
on

art
referring

the
early
works
in

tombs
about
memphis
declares
that
as
monuments
of
the
period
of
the
fourth
dynasty
they
are
an
evidence
of
the
high
perfection
to
which
the
sculpture
of
the
egyptians
had
attained
brugsch
declares
that
every
artistic
production
of
those
early
days
whether
picture
writing
or
sculpture
bears
the
stamp
of
the
highest
perfection
in
art
maspero
the
most
eminent
french
authority
in
this
field
while
expressing
his
belief
that
the
sphinx
was
sculptured
even
before
the
time
of
mena
declares
that
the
art
which
conceived
and
carved
this
prodigious
statue
was
a
finished
art
an
art
which
had
attained
and
was
sure
of
its
effects
while
among
the
more
eminent
english
authorities
sayce
tells
us
that
art
is
at
its
best
in
the
age
of
the
and
sir
james
fergusson
declares
we
are
startled
to
find
egyptian
art
nearly
as
perfect
in
the
oldest
periods
as
in
any
of
the
later
the
evidence
as
to
the
high
development
of
egyptian
sculpture
in
the
earlier
dynasties
becomes
every
day
more
overwhelming
what
exquisite
genius
the
early
egyptian
sculptors
showed
in
their
lesser
statues
is
known
to
all
who
have
seen
those
most
precious
specimens
in
the
museum
at
cairo
which
were
wrought
before
the
conventional
type
was
adopted
in
obedience
to
religious
considerations
in
decorative
and
especially
in
ceramic
art
as
early
as
the
fourth
and
fifth
dynasties
we
have
vases
cups
and
other
vessels
showing
exquisite
beauty
of
outline
and
a
general
sense
of
form
almost
if
not
quite
equal
to
etruscan
and
grecian
work
of
the
best
periods
take
next
astronomy
going
back
to
the
very
earliest
period
of
egyptian
civilization
we
find
that
the
four
sides
of
the
great
pyramid
are
adjusted
to
the
cardinal
points
with
the
utmost
precision
the
day
of
the
equinox
can
be
taken
by
observing
the
sun
set
across
the
face
of
the
pyramid
and
the
neighbouring
arabs
adjust
their
astronomical
dates
by
its
shadow
yet
this
is
but
one
out
of
many
facts
which
prove
that
the
egyptians
at
the
earliest
period
of
which
their
monuments
exist
had
arrived
at
knowledge
and
skill
only
acquired
by
long
ages
of
observation
and
thought
lockyer
astronomer
royal
of
great
britain
has
recently
convinced
himself
after
careful
examination
of
various
ruined
temples
at
thebes
and
elsewhere
that
they
were
placed
with
reference
to
observations
of
stars
to
state
his
conclusion
in
his
own
words
there
seems
a
very
high
probability
that
three
thousand
and
possibly
four
thousand
years
before
christ
the
egyptians
had
among
them
men
with
some
knowledge
of
astronomy
and
that
six
thousand
years
ago
the
course
of
the
sun
through
the
year
was
practically
very
well
known
and
methods
had
been
invented
by
means
of
which
in
time
it
might
be
better
known
and
that
not
very
long
after
that
they
not
only
considered
questions
relating
to
the
sun
but
began
to
take
up
other
questions
relating
to
the
position
and
movement
of
the
stars
the
same
view
of
the
antiquity
of
man
in
the
nile
valley
is
confirmed
by
philologists
to
use
the
words
of
max
duncker
the
oldest
monuments
of
egypt
and
they
are
the
oldest
monuments
in
the
world
exhibit
the
egyptian
in
possession
of
the
art
of
writing
it
is
found
also
by
the
inscriptions
of
the
early
dynasties
that
the
egyptian
language
had
even
at
that
early
time
been
developed
in
all
essential
particulars
to
the
highest
point
it
ever
attained
what
long
periods
it
must
have
required
for
such
a
development
every
scholar
in
philology
can
imagine
as
regards
medical
science
we
have
the
berlin
papyrus
which
although
of
a
later
period
refers
with
careful
specification
to
a
medical
literature
of
the
first
dynasty
as
regards
archaeology
the
earliest
known
inscriptions
point
to
still
earlier
events
and
buildings
indicating
a
long
sequence
in
previous
history
as
to
all
that
pertains
to
the
history
of
civilization
no
man
of
fair
and
open
mind
can
go
into
the
museums
of
cairo
or
the
louvre
or
the
british
museum
and
look
at
the
monuments
of
those
earlier
dynasties
without
seeing
in
them
the
results
of
a
development
in
art
science
laws
customs
and
language
which
must
have
required
a
vast
period
before
the
time
of
mena
and
this
conclusion
is
forced
upon
us
all
the
more
invincibly
when
we
consider
the
slow
growth
of
ideas
in
the
earlier
stages
of
civilization
as
compared
with
the
later
a
slowness
of
growth
which
has
kept
the
natives
of
many
parts
of
the
world
in
that
earliest
civilization
to
this
hour
to
this
we
must
add
the
fact
that
egyptian
civilization
was
especially
immobile
its
development
into
castes
is
but
one
among
many
evidences
that
it
was
the
very
opposite
of
a
civilization
developed
rapidly
as
to
the
length
of
the
period
before
the
time
of
mena
there
is
of
course
nothing
exact
manetho
gives
lists
of
great
personages
before
that
first
dynasty
and
these
extend
over
thousand
years
bunsen
one
of
the
most
learned
of
christian
scholars
declares
that
not
less
than
ten
thousand
years
were
necessary
for
the
development
of
civilization
up
to
the
point
where
we
find
it
in
mena
time
no
one
can
claim
precision
for
either
of
these
statements
but
they
are
valuable
as
showing
the
impression
of
vast
antiquity
made
upon
the
most
competent
judges
by
the
careful
study
of
those
remains
no
unbiased
judge
can
doubt
that
an
immensely
long
period
of
years
must
have
been
required
for
the
development
of
civilization
up
to
the
state
in
which
we
there
find
it
the
investigations
in
the
bed
of
the
nile
confirm
these
views
that
some
unwarranted
conclusions
have
at
times
been
announced
is
true
but
the
fact
remains
that
again
and
again
rude
pottery
and
other
evidences
of
early
stages
of
civilization
have
been
found
in
borings
at
places
so
distant
from
each
other
and
at
depths
so
great
that
for
such
a
range
of
concurring
facts
considered
in
connection
with
the
rate
of
earthy
deposit
by
the
nile
there
is
no
adequate
explanation
save
the
existence
of
man
in
that
valley
thousands
on
thousands
of
years
before
the
longest
time
admitted
by
our
sacred
chronologists
nor
have
these
investigations
been
of
a
careless
character
between
the
years
and
horner
an
extremely
cautious
english
geologist
sank
shafts
in
four
rows
at
intervals
of
eight
english
miles
at
right
angles
to
the
nile
in
the
neighbourhood
of
memphis
in
these
pottery
was
brought
up
from
various
depths
and
beneath
the
statue
of
rameses
ii
at
memphis
from
a
depth
of
feet
at
the
rate
of
the
nile
deposit
a
careful
estimate
has
declared
this
to
indicate
a
period
of
over
eleven
thousand
years
so
eminent
a
german
authority
in
geography
as
peschel
characterizes
objections
to
such
deductions
as
groundless
however
this
may
be
the
general
results
of
these
investigations
taken
in
connection
with
the
other
results
of
research
are
convincing
and
finally
as
if
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
a
series
of
archaeologists
of
the
highest
standing
french
german
english
and
american
have
within
the
past
twenty
years
discovered
relics
of
a
savage
period
of
vastly
earlier
date
than
the
time
of
mena
prevailing
throughout
egypt
these
relics
have
been
discovered
in
various
parts
of
the
country
from
cairo
to
luxor
in
great
numbers
they
are
the
same
sort
of
prehistoric
implements
which
prove
to
us
the
early
existence
of
man
in
so
many
other
parts
of
the
world
at
a
geological
period
so
remote
that
the
figures
given
by
our
sacred
chronologists
are
but
trivial
the
last
and
most
convincing
of
these
discoveries
that
of
flint
implements
in
the
drift
far
down
below
the
tombs
of
early
kings
at
thebes
and
upon
high
terraces
far
above
the
present
bed
of
the
nile
will
be
referred
to
later
but
it
is
not
in
egypt
alone
that
proofs
are
found
of
the
utter
inadequacy
of
the
entire
chronological
system
derived
from
our
sacred
books
these
results
of
research
in
egypt
are
strikingly
confirmed
by
research
in
assyria
and
babylonia
sayce
exhibits
various
proofs
of
this
to
use
his
own
words
regarding
one
of
these
proofs
on
the
shelves
of
the
british
museum
you
may
see
huge
bricks
on
which
are
stamped
the
names
and
titles
of
kings
who
erected
or
repaired
the
temples
where
they
have
been
found
they
must
have
reigned
before
the
time
when
according
to
the
margins
of
our
bibles
the
flood
of
noah
was
covering
the
earth
and
reducing
such
bricks
as
these
to
their
primeval
slime
this
conclusion
was
soon
placed
beyond
a
doubt
the
lists
of
king
and
collateral
inscriptions
recovered
from
the
temples
of
the
great
valley
between
the
tigris
and
euphrates
and
the
records
of
astronomical
observations
in
that
region
showed
that
there
too
a
powerful
civilization
had
grown
up
at
a
period
far
earlier
than
could
be
made
consistent
with
our
sacred
chronology
the
science
of
assyriology
was
thus
combined
with
egyptology
to
furnish
one
more
convincing
proof
that
precious
as
are
the
moral
and
religious
truths
in
our
sacred
books
and
the
historical
indications
which
they
give
us

the

i
the
while
the
view
of
chronology
based
upon
the
literal
acceptance
of
scripture
texts
was
thus
shaken
by
researches
in
egypt
another
line
of
observation
and
thought
was
slowly
developed
even
more
fatal
to
the
theological
view
from
a
very
early
period
there
had
been
dug
from
the
earth
in
various
parts
of
the
world
strangely
shaped
masses
of
stone
some
rudely
chipped
some
polished
in
ancient
times
the
larger
of
these
were
very
often
considered
as
thunderbolts
the
smaller
as
arrows
and
all
of
them
as
weapons
which
had
been
hurled
by
the
gods
and
other
supernatural
personages
hence
a
sort
of
sacredness
attached
to
them
in
chaldea
they
were
built
into
the
wall
of
temples
in
egypt
they
were
strung
about
the
necks
of
the
dead
in
india
fine
specimens
are
to
this
day
seen
upon
altars
receiving
prayers
and
sacrifices
naturally
these
beliefs
were
brought
into
the
christian
mythology
and
adapted
to
it
during
the
middle
ages
many
of
these
stones
were
venerated
as
weapons
which
during
the
war
in
heaven
had
been
used
in
driving
forth
satan
and
his
hosts
hence
in
the
eleventh
century
an
emperor
of
the
east
sent
to
the
emperor
of
the
west
a
heaven
axe
and
in
the
twelfth
century
a
bishop
of
rennes
asserted
the
value
of
as
a
means
of
securing
success
in
battle
safety
on
the
sea
security
against
thunder
and
immunity
from
unpleasant
dreams
even
as
late
as
the
seventeenth
century
a
french
ambassador
brought
a
stone
hatchet
which
still
exists
in
the
museum
at
nancy
as
a
present
to
the
of
verdun
and
claimed
for
it
virtues
in
the
last
years
of
the
sixteenth
century
michael
mercati
tried
to
prove
that
the
were
weapons
or
implements
of
early
races
of
men
but
from
some
cause
his
book
was
not
published
until
the
following
century
when
other
thinkers
had
begun
to
take
up
the
same
idea
and
then
it
had
to
contend
with
a
theory
far
more
accordant
with
theologic
modes
of
reasoning
in
science
this
was
the
theory
of
the
learned
tollius
who
in
told
the
world
that
these
chipped
or
smoothed
stones
were
generated
in
the
sky
by
a
fulgurous
exhalation
conglobed
in
a
cloud
by
the
circumposed
humour
but
about
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
a
fact
of
great
importance
was
quietly
established
in
the
year
a
large
pointed
weapon
of
black
flint
was
found
in
contact
with
the
bones
of
an
elephant
in
a
gravel
bed
near
gray
inn
lane
in
london
the
world
in
general
paid
no
heed
to
this
if
the
attention
of
theologians
was
called
to
it
they
dismissed
it
summarily
with
a
reference
to
the
deluge
of
noah
but
the
specimen
was
labelled
the
circumstances
regarding
it
were
recorded
and
both
specimen
and
record
carefully
preserved
in
jussieu
addressed
the
french
academy
on
the
origin
and
uses
of
he
showed
that
recent
travellers
from
various
parts
of
the
world
had
brought
a
number
of
weapons
and
other
implements
of
stone
to
france
and
that
they
were
essentially
similar
to
what
in
europe
had
been
known
as
a
year
later
this
fact
was
clinched
into
the
scientific
mind
of
france
by
the
jesuit
lafitau
who
published
a
work
showing
the
similarity
between
the
customs
of
aborigines
then
existing
in
other
lands
and
those
of
the
early
inhabitants
of
europe
so
began
in
these
works
of
jussieu
and
lafitau
the
science
of
comparative
ethnography
but
it
was
at
their
own
risk
and
peril
that
thinkers
drew
from
these
discoveries
any
conclusions
as
to
the
antiquity
of
man
montesquieu
having
ventured
to
hint
in
an
early
edition
of
his
persian
letters
that
the
world
might
be
much
older
than
had
been
generally
supposed
was
soon
made
to
feel
danger
both
to
his
book
and
to
himself
so
that
in
succeeding
editions
he
suppressed
the
passage
in
mahudel
presented
a
paper
to
the
french
academy
of
inscriptions
on
the
and
also
presented
a
series
of
plates
which
showed
that
these
were
stone
implements
which
must
have
been
used
at
an
early
period
in
human
history
in
buffon
in
his
epoques
de
la
nature
intimated
his
belief
that
were
made
by
early
races
of
men
but
he
did
not
press
this
view
and
the
reason
for
his
reserve
was
obvious
enough
he
had
already
one
quarrel
with
the
theologians
on
his
hands
which
had
cost
him
dear
public
retraction
and
humiliation
his
declaration
therefore
attracted
little
notice
in
the
year
another
fact
came
into
the
minds
of
thinking
men
in
england
in
that
year
john
frere
presented
to
the
london
society
of
antiquaries
sundry
flint
implements
found
in
the
clay
beds
near
hoxne
that
they
were
of
human
make
was
certain
and
in
view
of
the
undisturbed
depths
in
which
they
were
found
the
theory
was
suggested
that
the
men
who
made
them
must
have
lived
at
a
very
ancient
geological
epoch
yet
even
this
discovery
and
theory
passed
like
a
troublesome
dream
and
soon
seemed
to
be
forgotten
about
twenty
years
later
buckland
published
a
discussion
of
the
subject
in
the
light
of
various
discoveries
in
the
drift
and
in
caves
it
received
wide
attention
but
theology
was
soothed
by
his
temporary
concession
that
these
striking
relics
of
human
handiwork
associated
with
the
remains
of
various
extinct
animals
were
proofs
of
the
deluge
of
noah
in
boue
of
the
vienna
academy
of
sciences
showed
to
cuvier
sundry
human
bones
found
deep
in
the
alluvial
deposits
of
the
upper
rhine
and
suggested
that
they
were
of
an
early
geological
period
this
cuvier
virtually
if
not
explicitly
denied
great
as
he
was
in
his
own
field
he
was
not
a
great
geologist
he
in
fact
led
geology
astray
for
many
years
moreover
he
lived
in
a
time
of
reaction
it
was
the
period
of
the
restored
bourbons
of
the
voltairean
king
louis
xviii
governing
to
please
orthodoxy
boue
discovery
was
therefore
at
first
opposed
then
enveloped
in
studied
silence
cuvier
evidently
thought
as
voltaire
had
felt
under
similar
circumstances
that
among
wolves
one
must
howl
a
little
and
his
leading
disciple
elie
de
beaumont
who
succeeded
him
in
the
sway
over
geological
science
in
france
was
even
more
opposed
to
the
new
view
than
his
great
master
had
been
boue
discoveries
were
therefore
apparently
laid
to
rest
forever

general

in

cavern
near

was
explored
by
the
rev
mcenery
a
roman
catholic
clergyman
who
seems
to
have
been
completely
overawed
by
orthodox
opinion
in
england
and
elsewhere
for
though
he
found
human
bones
and
implements
mingled
with
remains
of
extinct
animals
he
kept
his
notes
in
manuscript
and
they
were
only
brought
to
light
more
than
thirty
years
later
by
vivian
the
coming
of
charles
x
the
last
of
the
french
bourbons
to
the
throne
made
the
orthodox
pressure
even
greater
it
was
the
culmination
of
the
reactionary
period
the
time
in
france
when
a
clerical
committee
sitting
at
the
tuileries
took
such
measures
as
were
necessary
to
hold
in
check
all
science
that
was
not
perfectly
safe
the
time
in
austria
when
kaiser
franz
made
his
famous
declaration
to
sundry
professors
that
what
he
wanted
of
them
was
simply
to
train
obedient
subjects
and
that
those
who
did
not
make
this
their
purpose
would
be
dismissed
the
time
in
germany
when
nicholas
of
russia
and
the
princelings
and
ministers
under
his
control
from
the
king
of
prussia
downward
put
forth
all
their
might
in
behalf
of
scriptural
science
the
time
in
italy
when
a
scientific
investigator
arriving
at
any
conclusion
distrusted
by
the
church
was
sure
of
losing
his
place
and
in
danger
of
losing
his
liberty
the
time
in
england
when
what
little
science
was
taught
was
held
in
due
submission
to
archdeacon
paley
the
time
in
the
united
states
when
the
first
thing
essential
in
science
was
that
it
be
adjusted
to
the
ideas
of
revival
exhorters
yet
men
devoted
to
scientific
truth
laboured
on
and
in
tournal
of
narbonne
discovered
in
the
cavern
of
bize
specimens
of
human
industry
with
a
fragment
of
a
human
skeleton
among
bones
of
extinct
animals
in
the
following
year
christol
published
accounts
of
his
excavations
in
the
caverns
of
gard
he
had
found
in
position
and
under
conditions
which
forbade
the
idea
of
human
remains
mixed
with
bones
of
the
extinct
hyena
of
the
early
quaternary
period
little
general
notice
was
taken
of
this
for
the
reactionary
orthodox
atmosphere
involved
such
discoveries
in
darkness
but
in
the
french
revolution
of
the
old
system
collapsed
charles
x
and
his
advisers
fled
for
their
lives
the
other
continental
monarchs
got
glimpses
of
new
light
the
priesthood
in
charge
of
education
were
put
on
their
good
behaviour
for
a
time
and
a
better
era
began
under
the
constitutional
monarchy
of
the
house
of
orleans
in
france
and
belgium
less
attention
was
therefore
paid
by
government
to
the
saving
of
souls
and
we
have
in
rapid
succession
new
discoveries
of
remains
of
human
industry
and
even
of
human
skeletons
so
mingled
with
bones
of
extinct
animals
as
to
give
additional
proofs
that
the
origin
of
man
was
at
a
period
vastly
earlier
than
any
which
theologians
had
dreamed
of
a
few
years
later
the
reactionary
clerical
influence
against
science
in
this
field
rallied
again
schmerling
in
had
explored
a
multitude
of
caverns
in
belgium
especially
at
engis
and
engihoul
and
had
found
human
skulls
and
bones
closely
associated
with
bones
of
extinct
animals
such
as
the
cave
bear
hyena
elephant
and
rhinoceros
while
mingled
with
these
were
evidences
of
human
workmanship
in
the
shape
of
chipped
flint
implements
discoveries
of
a
similar
sort
had
been
made
by
de
serres
in
france
and
by
lund
in
brazil
but
at
least
as
far
as
continental
europe
was
concerned
these
discoveries
were
received
with
much
coolness
both
by
catholic
leaders
of
opinion
in
france
and
belgium
and
by
protestant
leaders
in
england
and
holland
schmerling
himself
appears
to
have
been
overawed
and
gave
forth
a
sort
of
apologetic
theory
half
scientific
half
theologic
vainly
hoping
to
satisfy
the
clerical
side
nor
was
it
much
better
in
england
sir
charles
lyell
so
devoted
a
servant
of
prehistoric
research
thirty
years
later
was
still
holding
out
against
it
on
the
scientific
side
and
as
to
the
theological
side
it
was
the
period
when
that
great
churchman
dean
cockburn
was
insulting
geologists
from
the
pulpit
of
york
minster
and
the
rev
mellor
brown
denouncing
geology
as
a
black
art
a
forbidden
province
and
when
in
america
moses
stuart
and
others
like
him
were
belittling
the
work
of
benjamin
silliman
and
edward
hitchcock
in
godwin
austin
presented
to
the
royal
geological
society
an
account
of
his
discoveries
in
kent
cavern
near
torquay
and
especially
of
human
bones
and
implements
mingled
with
bones
of
the
elephant
rhinoceros
cave
bear
hyena
and
other
extinct
animals
yet
this
memoir
like
that
of
mcenery
fifteen
years
before
found
an
atmosphere
so
unfavourable
that
it
was
not
published
ii
the
flint
weapons
and
implements
at
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
came
the
beginning
of
a
new
epoch
in
science
an
epoch
when
all
these
earlier
discoveries
were
to
be
interpreted
by
means
of
investigations
in
a
different
field
for
in
a
man
previously
unknown
to
the
world
at
large
boucher
de
perthes
published
at
paris
the
first
volume
of
his
work
on
celtic
and
antediluvian
antiquities
and
in
this
he
showed
engravings
of
typical
flint
implements
and
weapons
of
which
he
had
discovered
thousands
upon
thousands
in
the
high
drift
beds
near
abbeville
in
northern
france
the
significance
of
this
discovery
was
great
indeed
far
greater
than
boucher
himself
at
first
supposed
the
very
title
of
his
book
showed
that
he
at
first
regarded
these
implements
and
weapons
as
having
belonged
to
men
overwhelmed
at
the
deluge
of
noah
but
it
was
soon
seen
that
they
were
something
very
different
from
proofs
of
the
literal
exactness
of
genesis
for
they
were
found
in
terraces
at
great
heights
above
the
river
somme
and
under
any
possible
theory
having
regard
to
fact
must
have
been
deposited
there
at
a
time
when
the
river
system
of
northern
france
was
vastly
different
from
anything
known
within
the
historic
period
the
whole
discovery
indicated
a
series
of
great
geological
changes
since
the
time
when
these
implements
were
made
requiring
cycles
of
time
compared
to
which
the
space
allowed
by
the
orthodox
chronologists
was
as
nothing
his
work
was
the
result
of
over
ten
years
of
research
and
thought
year
after
year
a
force
of
men
under
his
direction
had
dug
into
these
gravel
deposits
of
the
river
somme
and
in
his
book
he
now
gave
in
the
first
full
form
the
results
of
his
labour
so
far
as
france
was
concerned
he
was
met
at
first
by
what
he
calls
a
conspiracy
of
silence
and
then
by
a
contemptuous
opposition
among
orthodox
scientists
at
the
head
of
whom
stood
elie
de
beaumont
this
heavy
sluggish
opposition
seemed
immovable
nothing
that
boucher
could
do
or
say
appeared
to
lighten
the
pressure
of
the
orthodox
theological
opinion
behind
it
not
even
his
belief
that
these
fossils
were
remains
of
men
drowned
at
the
deluge
of
noah
and
that
they
were
proofs
of
the
literal
exactness
of
genesis
seemed
to
help
the
matter
his
opponents
felt
instinctively
that
such
discoveries
boded
danger
to
the
accepted
view
and
they
were
right
boucher
himself
soon
saw
the
folly
of
trying
to
account
for
them
by
the
orthodox
theory
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
not
a
little
force
was
added
to
the
opposition
by
certain
characteristics
of
boucher
de
perthes
himself
gifted
and
vigorous
as
he
was
he
was
his
own
worst
enemy
carried
away
by
his
own
discoveries
he
jumped
to
the
most
astounding
conclusions
the
engravings
in
the
later
volume
of
his
great
work
showing
what
he
thought
to
be
human
features
and
inscriptions
upon
some
of
the
flint
implements
are
worthy
of
a
comic
almanac
and
at
the
national
museum
of
archaeology
at
germain
beneath
the
shelves
bearing
the
remains
which
he
discovered
which
mark
the
beginning
of
a
new
epoch
in
science
are
drawers
containing
specimens
hardly
worthy
of
a
penny
museum
but
from
which
he
drew
the
most
unwarranted
inferences
as
to
the
language
religion
and
usages
of
prehistoric
man
boucher
triumphed
none
the
less
among
his
bitter
opponents
at
first
was
rigollot
who
in
searching
earnestly
for
materials
to
refute
the
innovator
dug
into
the
deposits
of
acheul
and
was
converted
for
he
found
implements
similar
to
those
of
abbeville
making
still
more
certain
the
existence
of
man
during
the
drift
period
so
too
gaudry
a
year
later
made
similar
discoveries
but
most
important
was
the
evidence
of
the
truth
which
now
came
from
other
parts
of
france
and
from
other
countries
the
french
leaders
in
geological
science
had
been
held
back
not
only
by
awe
of
cuvier
but
by
recollections
of
scheuchzer
ridicule
has
always
been
a
serious
weapon
in
france
and
the
ridicule
which
finally
overtook
the
supporters
of
the
attempt
of
scheuchzer
mazurier
and
others
to
square
geology
with
genesis
was
still
remembered
from
the
great
body
of
french
geologists
therefore
boucher
secured
at
first
no
aid
his
support
came
from
the
other
side
of
the
channel
the
most
eminent
english
geologists
such
as
falconer
prestwich
and
lyell
visited
the
beds
at
abbeville
and
acheul
convinced
themselves
that
the
discoveries
of
boucher
rigollot
and
their
colleagues
were
real
and
then
quietly
but
firmly
told
england
the
truth
and
now
there
appeared
a
most
effective
ally
in
france
the
arguments
used
against
boucher
de
perthes
and
some
of
the
other
early
investigators
of
bone
caves
had
been
that
the
implements
found
might
have
been
washed
about
and
turned
over
by
great
floods
and
therefore
that
they
might
be
of
a
recent
period
but
in
edward
lartet
published
an
account
of
his
own
excavations
at
the
grotto
of
aurignac
and
the
proof
that
man
had
existed
in
the
time
of
the
quaternary
animals
was
complete
this
grotto
had
been
carefully
sealed
in
prehistoric
times
by
a
stone
at
its
entrance
no
interference
from
disturbing
currents
of
water
had
been
possible
and
lartet
found
in
place
bones
of
eight
out
of
nine
of
the
main
species
of
animals
which
characterize
the
quaternary
period
in
europe
and
upon
them
marks
of
cutting
implements
and
in
the
midst
of
them
coals
and
ashes
close
upon
these
came
the
excavations
at
eyzies
by
lartet
and
his
english
colleague
christy
in
both
these
men
there
was
a
carefulness
in
making
researches
and
a
sobriety
in
stating
results
which
converted
many
of
those
who
had
been
repelled
by
the
enthusiasm
of
boucher
de
perthes
the
two
colleagues
found
in
the
stony
deposits
made
by
the
water
dropping
from
the
roof
of
the
cave
at
eyzies
the
bones
of
numerous
animals
extinct
or
departed
to
arctic
regions
one
of
these
a
vertebra
of
a
reindeer
with
a
flint
still
fast
in
it
and
with
these
were
found
evidences
of
fire
discoveries
like
these
were
thoroughly
convincing
yet
there
still
remained
here
and
there
gainsayers
in
the
supposed
interest
of
scripture
and
these
in
spite
of
the
convincing
array
of
facts
insisted
that
in
some
way
by
some
combination
of
circumstances
these
bones
of
extinct
animals
of
vastly
remote
periods
might
have
been
brought
into
connection
with
all
these
human
bones
and
implements
of
human
make
in
all
these
different
places
refusing
to
admit
that
these
ancient
relics
of
men
and
animals
were
of
the
same
period
such
gainsayers
virtually

for

a
new
class
of
discoveries
came
to
silence
this
opposition
at
la
madeleine
in
france
at
the
kessler
cave
in
switzerland
and
at
various
other
places
were
found
rude
but
striking
carvings
and
engravings
on
bone
and
stone
representing
sundry
specimens
of
those
species
and
these
specimens

casts
of
them
were
soon
to
be
seen
in

showed

hairy
mammoth
the
cave
bear
and
various
other
animals
of

carved
rudely

vigorously
by

men
and
to
complete
the
significance
of
these
discoveries
travellers
returning

of

especially
those

as

showing
that
man
was

contemporary
with
animals
of
past
geological
epochs
but
that
he
had
already
developed
into
a
stage
of
culture
above
pure
savagery
the
tide
of
thought
began
to
turn
especially
was
this
seen
in
when
lyell
published
the
first
edition
of
his
geological
evidence
of
the
antiquity
of
man
and
the
fact
that
he
had
so
long
opposed
the
new
ideas
gave
force
to
the
clear
and
conclusive
argument
which
led
him
to
renounce
his
early
scientific
beliefs
research
among
the
evidences
of
man
existence
in
the
early
quaternary
and
possibly
in
the
tertiary
period
was
now
pressed
forward
along
the
whole
line
in
gabriel
mortillet
founded
his
review
devoted
to
this
subject
and
in
the
first
of
a
series
of
scientific
congresses
devoted
to
such
researches
was
held
in
italy
these
investigations
went
on
vigorously
in
all
parts
of
france
and
spread
rapidly
to
other
countries
the
explorations
which
dupont
began
in
in
the
caves
of
belgium
gave
to
the
museum
at
brussels
eighty
thousand
flint
implements
forty
thousand
bones
of
animals
of
the
quaternary
period
and
a
number
of
human
skulls
and
bones
found
mingled
with
these
remains
from
germany
italy
spain
america
india
and
egypt
similar
results
were
reported
especially
noteworthy
were
the
further
explorations
of
the
caves
and
drift
throughout
the
british
islands
the
discovery
by
colonel
wood
in
of
flint
tools
in
the
same
strata
with
bones
of
the
earlier
forms
of
the
rhinoceros
was
but
typical
of
many
a
thorough
examination
of
the
caverns
of
brixham
and
torquay
by
pengelly
and
others
made
it
still
more
evident
that
man
had
existed
in
the
early
quaternary
period
the
existence
of
a
period
before
the
glacial
epoch
or
between
different
glacial
epochs
in
england
when
the
englishman
was
a
savage
using
rude
stone
tools
was
then
fully
ascertained
and
what
was
more
significant
there
were
clearly
shown
a
gradation
and
evolution
even
in
the
history
of
that
period
it
was
found
that
this
ancient
stone
epoch
showed
progress
and
development
in
the
upper
layers
of
the
caves
with
remains
of
the
reindeer
who
although
he
has
migrated
from
these
regions
still
exists
in
more
northern
climates
were
found
stone
implements
revealing
some
little
advance
in
civilization
next
below
these
sealed
up
in
the
stalagmite
came
as
a
rule
another
layer
in
which
the
remains
of
reindeer
were
rare
and
those
of
the
mammoth
more
frequent
the
implements
found
in
this
stratum
being
less
skilfully
made
than
those
in
the
upper
and
more
recent
layers
and
finally
in
the
lowest
levels
near
the
floors
of
these
ancient
caverns
with
remains
of
the
cave
bear
and
others
of
the
most
ancient
extinct
animals
were
found
stone
implements
evidently
of
a
yet
ruder
and
earlier
stage
of
human
progress
no
fairly
unprejudiced
man
can
visit
the
cave
and
museum
at
torquay
without
being
convinced
that
there
were
a
gradation
and
an
evolution
in
these
beginnings
of
human
civilization
the
evidence
is
complete
the
masses
of
breccia
taken
from
the
cave
with
the
various
soils
implements
and
bones
carefully
kept
in
place
put
this
progress
beyond
a
doubt
all
this
indicated
a
great
antiquity
for
the
human
race
but
in
it
lay
the
germs
of
still
another
great
truth
even
more
important
and
more
serious
in
its
consequences
to
the
older
theologic
view
which
will
be
discussed
in
the
following
chapter
but
new
evidences
came
in
showing
a
yet
greater
antiquity
of
man
remains
of
animals
were
found
in
connection
with
human
remains
which
showed
not
only
that
man
was
living
in
times
more
remote
than
the
earlier
of
the
new
investigators
had
dared
dream
but
that
some
of
these
early
periods
of
his
existence
must
have
been
of
immense
length
embracing
climatic
changes
betokening
different
geological
periods
for
with
remains
of
fire
and
human
implements
and
human
bones
were
found
not
only
bones
of
the
hairy
mammoth
and
cave
bear
woolly
rhinoceros
and
reindeer
which
could
only
have
been
deposited
there
in
a
time
of
arctic
cold
but
bones
of
the
hyena
hippopotamus
tiger
and
the
like
which
could
only
have
been
deposited
when
there
was
in
these
regions
a
torrid
climate
the
conjunction
of
these
remains
clearly
showed
that
man
had
lived
in
england
early
enough
and
long
enough
to
pass
through
times
when
there
was
arctic
cold
and
times
when
there
was
torrid
heat
times
when
great
glaciers
stretched
far
down
into
england
and
indeed
into
the
continent
and
times
when
england
had
a
land
connection
with
the
european
continent
and
the
european
continent
with
africa
allowing
tropical
animals
to
migrate
freely
from
africa
to
the
middle
regions
of
england
the
question
of
the
origin
of
man
at
a
period
vastly
earlier
than
the
sacred
chronologists
permitted
was
thus
absolutely
settled
but
among
the
questions
regarding
the
existence
of
man
at
a
period
yet
more
remote
the
drift
period
there
was
one
which
for
a
time
seemed
to
give
the
champions
of
science
some
difficulty
the
orthodox
leaders
in
the
time
of
boucher
de
perthes
and
for
a
considerable
time
afterward
had
a
weapon
of
which
they
made
vigorous
use
the
statement
that
no
human
bones
had
yet
been
discovered
in
the
drift
the
supporters
of
science
naturally
answered
that
few
if
any
other
bones
as
small
as
those
of
man
had
been
found
and
that
this
fact
was
an
additional
proof
of
the
great
length
of
the
period
since
man
had
lived
with
the
extinct
animals
for
since
specimens
of
human
workmanship
proved
man
existence
as
fully
as
remains
of
his
bones
could
do
the
absence
or
even
rarity
of
human
and
other
small
bones
simply
indicated
the
long
periods
of
time
required
for
dissolving
them
away
yet
boucher
inspired
by
the
genius
he
had
already
shown
and
filled
with
the
spirit
of
prophecy
declared
that
human
bones
would
yet
be
found
in
the
midst
of
the
flint
implements
and
in
he
claimed
that
this
prophecy
had
been
fulfilled
by
the
discovery
at
moulin
quignon
of
a
portion
of
a
human
jaw
deep
in
the
early
quaternary
deposits
but
his
triumph
was
the
opposition
ridiculed
his
discovery
they
showed
that
he
had
offered
a
premium
to
his
workmen
for
the
discovery
of
human
remains
and
they
naturally
drew
the
inference
that
some
tricky
labourer
had
deceived
him
the
result
of
this
was
that
the
men
of
science
felt
obliged
to
acknowledge
that
the
moulin
quignon
discovery
was
not
proven
but
ere
long
human
bones
were
found
in
the
deposits
of
the
early
quaternary
period
or
indeed
of
an
earlier
period
in
various
other
parts
of
the
world
and
the
question
regarding
the
moulin
quignon
relic
was
of
little
importance
we
have
seen
that
researches
regarding
the
existence
of
prehistoric
man
in
england
and
on
the
continent
were
at
first
mainly
made
in
the
caverns
but
the
existence
of
man
in
the
earliest
quaternary
period
was
confirmed
on
both
sides
of
the
english
channel
in
a
way
even
more
striking
by
the
close
examination
of
the
drift
and
early
gravel
deposits
the
results
arrived
at
by
boucher
de
perthes
were
amply
confirmed
in
england
rude
stone
implements
were
found
in
terraces
a
hundred
feet
and
more
above
the
levels
at
which
various
rivers
of
great
britain
now
flow
and
under
circumstances
which
show
that
at
the
time
when
they
were
deposited
the
rivers
of
great
britain
in
many
cases
were
entirely
different
from
those
of
the
present
period
and
formed
parts
of
the
river
system
of
the
european
continent
researches
in
the
high
terraces
above
the
thames
and
the
ouse
as
well
as
at
other
points
in
great
britain
placed
beyond
a
doubt
the
fact
that
man
existed
on
the
british
islands
at
a
time
when
they
were
connected
by
solid
land
with
the
continent
and
made
it
clear
that
within
the
period
of
the
existence
of
man
in
northern
europe
a
large
portion
of
the
british
islands
had
been
sunk
to
depths
between
fifteen
hundred
and
hundred
feet
beneath
the
northern
ocean
had
risen
again
from
the
water
had
formed
part
of
the
continent
of
europe
and
had
been
in
unbroken
connection
with
africa
so
that
elephants
bears
tigers
lions
the
rhinoceros
and
hippopotamus
of
species
now
mainly
extinct
had
left
their
bones
in
the
same
deposits
with
human
implements
as
far
north
as
yorkshire
moreover
connected
with
this
fact
came
in
the
new
conviction
forced
upon
geologists
by
the
more
careful
examination
of
the
earth
and
its
changes
that
such
elevations
and
depressions
of
great
britain
and
other
parts
of
the
world
were
not
necessarily
the
results
of
sudden
cataclysms
but
generally
of
slow
processes
extending
through
vast
cycles
of
years
processes
such
as
are
now
known
to
be
going
on
in
various
parts
of
the
world
thus
it
was
that
the
six
or
seven
thousand
years
allowed
by
the
most
liberal
theologians
of
former
times
were
seen
more
and
more
clearly
to
be
but
a
mere
nothing
in
the
long
succession
of
ages
since
the
appearance
of
man
confirmation
of
these
results
was
received
from
various
other
parts
of
the
world
in
africa
came
the
discovery
of
flint
implements
deep
in
the
hard
gravel
of
the
nile
valley
at
luxor
and
on
the
high
hills
behind
esneh
in
america
the
discoveries
at
trenton
and
at
various
places
in
delaware
ohio
minnesota
and
elsewhere
along
the
southern
edge
of
the
drift
of
the
glacial
epochs
clinched
the
new
scientific
truth
yet
more
firmly
and
the
statement
made
by
an
eminent
american
authority
is
that
man
was
on
this
continent
when
the
climate
and
ice
of
greenland
extended
to
the
mouth
of
new
york
harbour
the
discoveries
of
prehistoric
remains
on
the
pacific
coast
and
especially
in
british
columbia
finished
completely
the
last
chance
at
a
reasonable
contention
by
the
adherents
of
the
older
view
as
to
these
investigations
on
the
pacific
slope
of
the
united
states
the
discoveries
of
whitney
and
others
in
california
had
been
so
made
and
announced
that
the
judgment
of
scientific
men
regarding
them
was
suspended
until
the
visit
of
perhaps
the
greatest
living
authority
in
his
department
alfred
russel
wallace
in
he
confirmed
the
view
of
whitney
and
others
with
the
statement
that
both
the
actual
remains
and
works
of
man
found
deep
under
the
of
pliocene
age
show
that
he
existed
in
the
new
world
at
least
as
early
as
in
the
old
to
this
may
be
added
the
discoveries
in
british
columbia
which
prove
that
since
man
existed
in
these
regions
valleys
have
been
filled
up
by
drift
from
the
waste
of
mountains
to
a
depth
in
some
cases
of
fifteen
hundred
feet
this
covered
by
a
succession
of
tuffs
ashes
and
from
volcanoes
long
since
extinct
and
finally
cut
down
by
the
present
rivers
through
beds
of
solid
basalt
and
through
this
accumulation
of
lavas
and
gravels
the
immense
antiquity
of
the
human
remains
in
the
gravels
of
the
pacific
coast
is
summed
up
by
a
most
eminent
english
authority
and
declared
to
be
proved
first
by
the
present
river
systems
being
of
subsequent
date
sometimes
cutting
through
them
and
their
superincumbent
to
a
depth
of
two
thousand
feet
secondly
by
the
great
denudation
that
has
taken
place
since
they
were
deposited
for
they
sometimes
lie
on
the
summits
of

thousand
feet
high

fact

as
an
important
supplement
to
these
discoveries
of
ancient
implements
came
sundry
comparisons
made
by
eminent
physiologists
between
human
skulls
and
bones
found
in
different
places
and
under
circumstances
showing
vast
antiquity
human
bones
had
been
found
under
such
circumstances
as
early
as
at
cannstadt
near
stuttgart
and
in
in
the
neanderthal
near
dusseldorf
but
in
more
recent
searches
they
had
been
discovered
in
a
multitude
of
places
especially
in
germany
france
belgium
england
the
caucasus
africa
and
north
and
south
america
comparison
of
these
bones
showed
that
even
in
that
remote
quaternary
period
there
were
great
differences
of
race
and
here
again
came
in
an
argument
for
the
yet
earlier
existence
of
man
on
the
earth
for
long
previous
periods
must
have
been
required
to
develop
such
racial
differences
considerations
of
this
kind
gave
a
new
impulse
to
the
belief
that
man
existence
might
even
date
back
into
the
tertiary
period
the
evidence
for
this
earlier
origin
of
man
was
ably
summed
up
not
only
by
its
brilliant
advocate
mortillet
but
by
a
former
opponent
one
of
the
most
conservative
of
modern
anthropologists
quatrefages
and
the
conclusion
arrived
at
by
both
was
that
man
did
really
exist
in
the
tertiary
period
the
acceptance
of
this
conclusion
was
also
seen
in
the
more
recent
work
of
alfred
russel
wallace
who
though
very
cautious
and
conservative
placed
the
origin
of
man
not
only
in
the
tertiary
period
but
in
an
earlier
stage
of
it
than
most
had
dared
assign
even
in
the
miocene
the
first
thing
raising
a
strong
presumption
if
not
giving
proof
that
man
existed
in
the
tertiary
was
the
fact
that
from
all
explored
parts
of
the
world
came
in
more
and
more
evidence
that
in
the
earlier
quaternary
man
existed
in
different
strongly
marked
races
and
in
great
numbers
from
all
regions
which
geologists
had
explored
even
from
those
the
most
distant
and
different
from
each
other
came
this
same
evidence
from
northern
europe
to
southern
africa
from
france
to
china
from
new
jersey
to
british
columbia
from
british
columbia
to
peru
the
development
of
man
in
such
numbers
and
in
so
many
different
regions
with
such
differences
of
race
and
at
so
early
a
period
must
have
required
a
long
previous
time
this
argument
was
strengthened
by
discoveries
of
bones
bearing
marks
apparently
made
by
cutting
instruments
in
the
tertiary
formations
of
france
and
italy
and
by
the
discoveries
of
what
were
claimed
to
be
flint
implements
by
the
abbe
bourgeois
in
france
and
of
implements
and
human
bones
by
capellini
in
italy
on
the
other
hand
some
of
the
more
cautious
men
of
science
are
still
content
to
say
that
the
existence
of
man
in
the
tertiary
period
is
not
yet
proven
as
to
his
existence
throughout
the
quaternary
epoch
no
new
proofs
are
needed
even
so
determined
a
supporter
of
the
theological
side
as
the
duke
of
argyll
has
been
forced
to
yield
to
the
evidence
of
attempts
to
make
an
exact
chronological
statement
throwing
light
on
the
length
of
the
various
prehistoric
periods
the
most
notable
have
been
those
by
morlot
on
the
accumulated
strata
of
the
lake
of
geneva
by
gillieron
on
the
silt
of
lake
neufchatel
by
horner
in

and
by

delta
of
the
mississippi
but
while
these
have
failed
to
give
anything
like
an
exact
result
all
these
investigations
together
point
to
the
central
truth
so
amply
established
of
the
vast
antiquity
of
man
and
the
utter
inadequacy
of
the
chronology
given
in

sacred
books

period
of
man
past
life
upon
our
planet
which
has
been
fixed
by

always
everywhere
and
by
all
is
thus
perfectly
proved
to
be
insignificant

we
have

how
science
especially
within
the
eighteenth

nineteenth
centuries
has
thoroughly
changed
the
intelligent
thought
of
the
world
in
regard
to
the
antiquity
of
man
upon

and
how
the
fabric
built
upon

chronological
indications
in

first
by
the
early
fathers
of
the
church
afterward
by
the
medieval
doctors
and
finally
by
the
reformers
and
modern
orthodox
chronologists
has
virtually
disappeared
before
an
entirely
different
view
forced
upon
us
especially
by
egyptian
and
assyrian
studies
as
well
as
by
geology
and
archeology
in
this
chapter
i
purpose
to
present
some
outlines
of
the
work
of
anthropology
especially
as
assisted
by
ethnology
in
showing
what
the
evolution
of
human
civilization
has
been
here
too
the
change
from
the
old
theological
view
based
upon
the
letter
of
our
sacred
books
to
the
modern
scientific
view
based
upon
evidence
absolutely
irrefragable
is
complete
here
too
we
are
at
the
beginning
of
a
vast
change
in
the
basis
and
modes
of
thought
upon
man
a
change
even
more
striking
than
that
accomplished
by
copernicus
and
galileo
when
they
substituted
for
a
universe
in
which
sun
and
planets
revolved
about
the
earth
a
universe
in
which
the
earth
is
but
the
merest
grain
or
atom
revolving
with
other
worlds
larger
and
smaller
about
the
sun
and
all
these
forming
but
one
among
innumerable
systems
ever
since
the
beginning
of
man
effective
thinking
upon
the
great
problems
around
him
two
antagonistic
views
have
existed
regarding
the
life
of
the
human
race
upon
earth
the
first
of
these
is
the
belief
that
man
was
created
in
the
beginning
a
perfect
being
endowed
with
the
highest
moral
and
intellectual
powers
but
that
there
came
a
fall
and
as
its
result
the
entrance
into
the
world
of
evil
toil
sorrow
and
death
nothing
could
be
more
natural
than
such
an
explanation
of
the
existence
of
evil
in
times
when
men
saw
everywhere
miracle
and
nowhere
law
it
is
under
such
circumstances
by
far
the
most
easy
of
explanations
for
it
is
in
accordance
with
the
appearances
of
things
men
adopted
it
just
as
naturally
as
they
adopted
the
theory
that
the
almighty
hangs
up
the
stars
as
lights
in
the
solid
firmament
above
the
earth
or
hides
the
sun
behind
a
mountain
at
night
or
wheels
the
planets
around
the
earth
or
flings
comets
as
signs
and
wonders
to
scare
a
wicked
world
or
allows
evil
spirits
to
control
thunder
lightning
and
storm
and
to
cause
diseases
of
body
and
mind
or
opens
the
windows
of
heaven
to
let
down
the
waters
that
be
above
the
heavens
and
thus
to
give
rain
upon
the
earth
a
belief
then
in
a
primeval
period
of
innocence
and
perfection
moral
intellectual
and
physical
from
which
men
for
some
fault
fell
is
perfectly
in
accordance
with
what
we
should
expect
among
the
earliest
known
records
of
our
race
we
find
this
view
taking
shape
in
the
chaldean
legends
of
war
between
the
gods
and
of
a
fall
of
man
both
of
which
seemed
necessary
to
explain
the
existence
of
evil
in
greek
mythology
perhaps
the
statement
was
made
by
hesiod
to
him
it
was
revealed
regarding
the
men
of
the
most
ancient
times
that
they
were
at
first
a
golden
race
that
as
gods
they
were
wont
to
live
with
a
life
void
of
care
without
labour
and
trouble
nor
was
wretched
old
age
at
all
impending
but
ever
did
they
delight
themselves
out
of
the
reach
of
all
ills
and
they
died
as
if
overcome
by
sleep
all
blessings
were
theirs
of
its
own
will
the
fruitful
field
would
bear
them
fruit
much
and
ample
and
they
gladly
used
to
reap
the
labours
of
their
hands
in
quietness
along
with
many
good
things
being
rich
in
flocks
and
true
to
the
blessed
gods
but
there
came
a
fall
caused
by
human
curiosity
pandora
the
first
woman
created
received
a
vase
which
by
divine
command
was
to
remain
closed
but
she
was
tempted
to
open
it
and
troubles
sorrow
and
disease
escaped
into
the
world
hope
alone
remaining
so
too
in
roman
mythological
poetry
the
picture
by
ovid
is
but
one
among
the
many
exhibitions
of
this
same
belief
in
a
primeval
golden
age
a
saturnian
cycle
one
of
the
constantly
recurring
attempts
so
universal
and
so
natural
in
the
early
history
of
man
to
account
for
the
existence
of
evil
care
and
toil
on
earth
by
explanatory
myths
and
legends
this
view
growing
out
of
the
myths
legends
and
theologies
of
earlier
peoples
we
also
find
embodied
in
the
sacred
tradition
of
the
jews
and
especially
in
one
of
the
documents
which
form
the
impressive
poem
beginning
the
books
attributed
to
moses
as
to
the
christian
church
no
word
of
its
blessed
founder
indicates
that
it
was
committed
by
him
to
this
theory
or
that
he
even
thought
it
worthy
of
his
attention
how
like
so
many
other
dogmas
never
dreamed
of
by
jesus
of
nazareth
and
those
who
knew
him
best
it
was
developed
it
does
not
lie
within
the
province
of
this
chapter
to
point
out
nor
is
it
worth
our
while
to
dwell
upon
its
evolution
in
the
early
church
in
the
middle
ages
at
the
reformation
and
in
various
branches
of
the
protestant
church
suffice
it
that
though
among
nations
by
far
the
most
important
influence
in
its
favour
has
come
from
milton
inspiration
rather
than
from
that
of
older
sacred
books
no
doctrine
has
been
more
universally
accepted
always
everywhere
and
by
all
from
the
earliest
fathers
of
the
church
down
to
the
present
hour
on
the
other
hand
appeared
at
an
early
period
the
opposite
view
that
mankind
instead
of
having
fallen
from
a
high
intellectual
moral
and
religious
condition
has
slowly
risen
from
low
and
brutal
beginnings
in
greece
among
the
philosophers
contemporary
with
socrates
we
find
critias
depicting
a
rise
of
man
from
a
time
when
he
was
beastlike
and
lawless
through
a
period
when
laws
were
developed
to
a
time
when
morality
received
enforcement
from
religion
but
among
all
the
statements
of
this
theory
the
most
noteworthy
is
that
given
by
lucretius
in
his
great
poem
on
the
nature
of
things
despite
its
errors
it
remains
among
the
most
remarkable
examples
of
prophetic
insight
in
the
history
of
our
race
the
inspiration
of
lucretius
gave
him
almost
miraculous
glimpses
of
truth
his
view
of
the
development
of
civilization
from
the
rudest
beginnings
to
the
height
of
its
achievements
is
a
wonderful
growth
rooted
in
observation
and
thought
branching
forth
into
a
multitude
of
striking
facts
and
fancies
and
among
these
is
the
statement
regarding
the
sequence
of
inventions
man
earliest
arms
were
fingers
teeth
and
nails
and
stones
and
fragments
from
the
branching
woods
then
copper
next
and
last
as
latest
traced
the
tyrant
iron
thus
did
the
poet
prophesy
one
of
the
most
fruitful
achievements
of
modern
science
the
discovery
of
that
series
of
epochs
which
has
been
so
carefully
studied
in
our
century
very
striking
also
is
the
statement
of
horace
though
his
idea
is
evidently
derived
from
lucretius
he
dwells
upon
man
first
condition
on

as
low
and
bestial
and
pictures

in

progressing
from
the

of

to

this

at

it
seemed

to
remain
so
typical
of
the
simplicity
of
belief

took

then
came
the
fall
according
to
our
account
at
about
two
but
in
the
revival
of
learning
the
old
eclipsed
truth
reappeared
and
in
the
first
part
of
the
seventeenth
century
we
find
that
among
the
crimes
for
which
vanini
was
sentenced
at
toulouse
to
have
his
tongue
torn
out
and
to
be
burned
alive
was
his
belief
that
there
is
a
gradation
extending
upward
from
the
lowest
to
the
highest
form
of
created
beings
yet
in
the
same
century
the

of
bodin
bacon

and

were
evidently
undermining
the
old
idea
of
the
fall

upward
movement
of
man
out
of
animalism
and
barbarism
this
idea
took
firm
hold
upon
human
thought
and
in
the
following
centuries
such
men
as
lessing
and
turgot
gave
new
force
to
it

investigations
of
the

lucretius

prophets
what
they

been

thoroughly
based
upon
facts
carefully
ascertained
and
arranged
until
thomsen

the

these

the
first
blow
at
the
fully
developed
doctrine
of
the
fall
came
as
we
have
seen
from
geology
according
to
that
doctrine
as
held
quite
generally
from
its
beginnings
among
the
fathers
and
doctors
of
the
primitive
church
down
to
its
culmination
in
the
minds
of
great
protestants
like
john
wesley
the
statement
in
our
sacred
books
that
death
entered
the
world
by
sin
was
taken
as
a
historic
fact
necessitating
the
conclusion
that
before
the
serpent
persuaded
eve
to
eat
of
the
forbidden
fruit
death
on
our
planet
was
unknown
naturally
when
geology
revealed
in
the
strata
of
a
period
long
before
the
coming
of
man
on
earth
a
vast
multitude
of
carnivorous
tribes
fitted
to
destroy
their
on
land
and
sea
and
within
the
fossilized
skeletons
of
many
of
these
the
partially
digested
remains
of
animals
this
doctrine
was
too
heavy
to
be
carried
and
it
was
quietly
dropped
but
about
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
doctrine
of
the
rise
of
man
as
opposed
to
the
doctrine
of
his
fall
received
a
great
accession
of
strength
from
a
source
most
unexpected
as
we
saw
in
the
last
chapter
the
facts
proving
the
great
antiquity
of
man
foreshadowed
a
new
and
even
more
remarkable
idea
regarding
him
we
saw
it
is
true
that
the
opponents
of
boucher
de
perthes
while
they
could
not
deny
his
discovery
of
human
implements
in
the
drift
were
successful
in
securing
a
verdict
of
not
proven
as
regarded
his
discovery
of
human
bones
but
their
triumph
was
many
previous
discoveries
little
thought
of
up
to
that
time
began
to
be
studied
and
others
were
added
which
resulted
not
merely
in
confirming
the
truth
regarding
the
antiquity
of
man
but
in
establishing
another
doctrine
which
the
opponents
of
science
regarded
with
vastly
greater
dislike
the
doctrine
that
man
has
not
fallen
from
an
original
high
estate
in
which
he
was
created
about
six
thousand
years
ago
but
that
from
a
period
vastly
earlier
than
any
warranted
by
the
sacred
chronologists
he
has
been
in
spite
of
lapses
and
deteriorations
rising
a
brief
review
of
this
new
growth
of
truth
may
be
useful
as
early
as
jaeger
had
brought
out
from
a
quantity
of
quaternary
remains
dug
up
long
before
at
cannstadt
near
stuttgart
a
portion
of
a
human
skull
apparently
of
very
low
type
a
battle
raged
about
it
for
a
time
but
this
finally
subsided
owing
to
uncertainties
arising
from
the
circumstances
of
the
discovery
in
in
the
neanderthal
near
dusseldorf
among
quaternary
remains
gathered
on
the
floor
of
a
grotto
another
skull
was
found
bearing
the
same
evidence
of
a
low
human
type
as
in
the
case
of
the
cannstadt
skull
this
again
was
fiercely
debated
and
finally
the
questions
regarding
it
were
allowed
to
remain
in
suspense
but
new
discoveries
were
made
at
eguisheim
at
brux
at
spy
and
elsewhere
human
skulls
were
found
of
a
similarly
low
type
and
while
each
of
the
earlier
discoveries
was
open
to
debate
and
either
had
no
other
been
discovered
might
have
been
considered
an
abnormal
specimen
the
combination
of
all
these
showed
conclusively
that
not
only
had
a
race
of
men
existed
at
that
remote
period
but
that
it
was
of
a
type
as
low
as
the
lowest
perhaps
below
the
lowest
now
known
research
was
now
redoubled
and
as
a
result
human
skulls
and
complete
skeletons
of
various
types
began
to
be
discovered
in
the
ancient
deposits
of
many
other
parts
of
the
world
and
especially
in
france
belgium
germany
the
caucasus
africa
and
north
and
south
america
but
soon
began
to
emerge
from
all
these
discoveries
a
fact
of
enormous
importance
the
skulls
and
bones
found
at
cro
magnon
solutre
furfooz
grenelle
and
elsewhere
were
compared
and
it
was
thus
made
certain
that
various
races
had
already
appeared
and
lived
in
various
grades
of
civilization
even
in
those
exceedingly
remote
epochs
that
even
then
there
were
various
strata
of
humanity
ranging
from
races
of
a
very
low
to
those
of
a
very
high
type
and
that
upon
any
theory
certainly
upon
the
theory
of
the
origin
of
mankind
from
a
single
pair
two
things
were
evident
first
that
long
slow
processes
during
vast
periods
of
time
must
have
been
required
for
the
differentiation
of
these
races
and
for
the
evolution
of
man
up
to
the
point
where
the
better
specimens
show
him
certainly
in
the
early
quaternary
and
perhaps
in
the
tertiary
period
and
secondly
that
there
had
been
from
the
first
appearance
of
man
of
which
we
have
any
traces
an
upward
tendency

this
second
conclusion
the
upward
tendency
of
man
from
low
beginnings
was
made
more
and
more
clear
by
bringing
into
relations
with
these
remains
of
human
bodies
and
of
extinct
animals
the
remains
of
human
handiwork
as
stated
in
the
last
chapter
the
river
drift
and
bone
caves
in
great
britain
france
and
other
parts
of
the
world
revealed
a
progression
even
in
the
various
divisions
of
the
earliest
stone
period
for
beginning
at
the
very
lowest
strata
of
these
remains
on
the
floors
of
the
caverns
associated
mainly
with
the
bones
of
extinct
animals
such
as
the
cave
bear
the
hairy
elephant
and
the
like
were
the
rudest
implements
then
in
strata
above
these
sealed
in
the
stalagmite
of
the
cavern
floors
lying
with
the
bones
of
animals
extinct
but
more
recent
stone
implements
were
found
still
rude
but
as
a
rule
of
an
improved
type
and
finally
in
a
still
higher
stratum
associated
with
bones
of
animals
like
the
reindeer
and
bison
which
though
not
extinct
have
departed
to
other
climates
were
rude
stone
implements
on
the
whole
of
a
still
better
workmanship
such
was
the
foreshadowing
even
at
that
early
rude
stone
period
of
the
proofs
that
the
tendency
of
man
has
been
from
his
earliest
epoch
and
in
all
parts
of
the
world
as
a
rule
upward
but
this
rule
was
to
be
much
further
exemplified
about
while
the
french
and
english
geologists
were
working
more
especially
among
the
relics
of
the
drift
and
cave
periods
noted
archaeologists
of
the
north
forchammer
steenstrup
and
worsaae
were
devoting
themselves
to
the
investigation
of
certain
remains
upon
the
danish
peninsula
these
remains
were
of
two
kinds
first
there
were
vast
or
accumulations
of
shells
and
other
refuse
cast
aside
by
rude
tribes
which
at
some
unknown
age
in
the
past
lived
on
the
shores
of
the
baltic
principally
on
shellfish
that
these
were
very
ancient
was
evident
the
shells
of
oysters
and
the
like
found
in
them
were
far
larger
than
any
now
found
on
those
coasts
their
size
so
far
from
being
like
that
of
the
corresponding
varieties
which
now
exist
in
the
brackish
waters
of
the
baltic
was
in
every
case
like
that
of
those
varieties
which
only
thrive
in
the
waters
of
the
open
salt
sea
here
was
a
clear
indication
that
at
the
time
when
man
formed
these
those
coasts
were
in
far
more
direct
communication
with
the
salt
sea
than
at
present
and
that
sufficient
time
must
have
elapsed
since
that
period
to
have
wrought
enormous
changes
in
sea
and
land
throughout
those
regions
scattered
through
these
heaps
were
found
indications
of
a
grade
of
civilization
when
man
still
used
implements
of
stone
but
implements
and
weapons
which
though
still
rude
showed
a
progress
from
those
of
the
drift
and
early
cave
period
some
of
them
being
of
polished
stone
with
these
were
other
evidences
that
civilization
had
progressed
with
implements
rude
enough
to
have
survived
from
early
periods
other
implements
never
known
in
the
drift
and
bone
caves
began
to
appear
and
though
there
were
few
if
any
bones
of
other
domestic
animals
the
remains
of
dogs
were
found
everything
showed
that
there
had
been
a
progress
in
civilization
between
the
former
stone
epoch
and
this
the
second
series
of
discoveries
in
scandinavia
was
made
in
the
these
were
generally
formed
in
hollows
or
bowls
varying
in
depth
from
ten
to
thirty
feet
and
a
section
of
them
like
a
section
of
the
deposits
in
the
bone
caverns
showed
a
gradual
evolution
of
human
culture
the
lower
strata
in
these
great
bowls
were
found
to
be
made
up
chiefly
of
mosses
and
various
plants
matted
together
with
the
trunks
of
fallen
trees
sometimes
of
very
large
diameter
and
the
botanical
examination
of
the
lowest
layer
of
these
trees
and
plants
in
the
various
bowls
revealed
a
most
important
fact
for
this
layer
the
first
in
point
of
time
was
always
of
the
scotch
fir
which
now
grows
nowhere
in
the
danish
islands
and
can
not
be
made
to
grow
anywhere
in
them
and
of
plants
which
are
now
extinct
in
these
regions
but
have
retreated
within
the
arctic
circle
coming
up
from
the
bottom
of
these
great
bowls
there
was
found
above
the
first
layer
a
second
in
which
were
matted
together
masses
of
oak
trees
of
different
varieties
these
too
were
relics
of
a
bygone
epoch
since
the
oak
has
almost
entirely
disappeared
from
denmark
above
these
came
a
third
stratum
made
up
of
fallen
beech
trees
and
the
beech
is
now
and
has
been
since
the
beginning
of
recorded
history
the
most
common
tree
of
the
danish
peninsula
now
came
a
second
fact
of
the
utmost
importance
as
connected
with
the
first
scattered
as
a
rule
through
the
lower
of
these
deposits
that
of
the
extinct
fir
trees
and
plants
were
found
implements
and
weapons
of
smooth
stone
in
the
layer
of
oak
trees
were
found
implements
of
bronze
and
among
the
layer
of
beeches
were
found
implements
and
weapons
of
iron
the
general
result
of
these
investigations
in
these
two
sources
the
shell
mounds
and
the
peat
deposits
was
the
same
the
first
civilization
evidenced
in
them
was
marked
by
the
use
of
stone
implements
more
or
less
smooth
showing
a
progress
from
the
earlier
rude
stone
period
made
known
by
the
bone
caves
then
came
a
later
progress
to
a
higher
civilization
marked
by
the
use
of
bronze
implements
and
finally
a
still
higher
development
when
iron
began
to
be
used
the
labours
of
the
danish
archaeologists
have
resulted
in
the
formation
of
a
great
museum
at
copenhagen
and
on
the
specimens
they
have
found
coupled
with
those
of
the
drift
and
bone
caves
is
based
the
classification
between
the
main
periods
or
divisions
in
the
evolution
of
the
human
race
above
referred
to
it
was
not
merely
in
scandinavian
lands
that
these
results
were
reached
substantially
the

discoveries
were
made
in

but
from
another
quarter
came
a
yet
more
striking
indication
of
this
same
evolution
as
far
back
as
the
year
there
were
discovered
in
the
lake

and

antiquities
indicating
a
former
existence
of
human
dwellings
standing
in

but
the
usual
mixture

thoughtlessness
and
dread

ideas
seems
to
have
prevailed

was
done

than
his
predecessor
of
the
drift
cave
and
periods
and
had
gone
on
from
better
to
better
very
striking
evidences
of
this
upward
tendency
were
found
in
each
class
of
implements
as
by
comparing
the
chipped
flint
implements
of
the
lower
and
earlier
strata
in
the
cave
period
with
those
of
the
later
and
upper
strata
we
saw
progress
so
in
each
of
the
periods
of
polished
stone
bronze
and
iron
we
see
by
similar
comparisons
a
steady
progress
from
rude
to
perfected
implements
and
especially
is
this
true
in
the
remains
of
the
various
for
among
these
can
be
traced
out
constant
increase
in
the
variety
of
animals
domesticated
and
gradual
improvements
in
means
of
subsistence
and
in
ways
of
living
incidentally
too
a
fact
at
first
sight
of
small
account
but
on
reflection
exceedingly
important
was
revealed
the
earlier
bronze
implements
were
frequently
found
to
imitate
in
various
minor
respects
implements
of
stone
in
other
words
forms
were
at
first
given
to
bronze
implements
natural
in
working
stone
but
not
natural
in
working
bronze
this
showed
the
direction
of
the
development
that
it
was
upward
from
stone
to
bronze
not
downward
from
bronze
to
stone
that
it
was
progress
rather
than
decline
these
investigations
were
supplemented
by
similar
researches
elsewhere
in
many
other
parts
of
the
world
it
was
found
that
had
existed
in
different
grades
of
civilization
but
all
within
a
certain
range
intermediate
between
the
and
the
historic
period
to
explain
this
epoch
of
the
history
came
in
with
the
account
given
by
herodotus
of
the
on
lake
prasias
which
gave
protection
from
the
armies
of
persia
still
more
important
comparative
ethnography
showed
that
in
various
parts
of
the
world
especially
in
new
guinea
and
west
africa
races
of
men
are
living
in
built
upon
piles
and
with
a
range
of
implements
and
weapons
strikingly
like
many
of
those
discovered
in
these
ancient
lake
deposits
of
switzerland
in
great
britain
france
germany
italy
ireland
scotland
and
other
countries
remains
of
a
different
sort
were
also
found
throwing
light
on
this
progress
the
cromlechs
cranogs
mounds
and
the
like
though
some
of
them
indicate
the
work
of
weaker
tribes
pressed
upon
by
stronger
show
as
a
rule
the
same
upward
tendency
at
a
very
early
period
in
the
history
of
these
discoveries
various
attempts
were
made
nominally
in
the
interest
of
religion
but
really
in
the
interest
of
sundry
creeds
and
catechisms
framed
when
men
knew
little
or
nothing
of
natural
laws
to
break
the
force
of
such
evidences
of
the
progress
and
development
of
the
human
race
from
lower
to
higher
out
of
all
the
earlier
efforts
two
may
be
taken
as
fairly
typical
for
they
exhibit
the
opposition
to
science
as
developed
under
two
different
schools
of
theology
each
working
in
its
own
way
the
first
of
these
shows
great
ingenuity
and
learning
and
is
presented
by
southall
in
his
book
published
in
entitled
the
recent
origin
of
the
world
in
this
he
grapples
first
of
all
with
the
difficulties
presented
by
the
early
date
of
egyptian
civilization
and
the
keynote
of
his
argument
is
the
statement
made
by
an
eminent
egyptologist
at
a
period
before
modern
archaeological
discoveries
were
well
understood
that
egypt
laughs
the
idea
of
a
rude
stone
age
a
polished
stone
age
a
bronze
age
an
iron
age
to
scorn
southall
method
was
substantially
that
of
the
late
excellent
gosse
in
geology
gosse
as
the
readers
of
this
work
may
remember
felt
obliged
in
the
supposed
interest
of
genesis
to
urge
that
safety
to
men
souls
might
be
found
in
believing
that
six
thousand
years
ago
the
almighty
for
some
inscrutable
purpose
suddenly
set
niagara
pouring
very
near
the
spot
where
it
is
pouring
now
laid
the
various
strata
and
sprinkled
the
fossils
through
them
like
plums
through
a
pudding
scratched
the
glacial
grooves
upon
the
rocks
and
did
a
vast
multitude
of
things
subtle
and
cunning
little
and
great
in
all
parts
of
the
world
required
to
delude
geologists
of
modern
times
into
the
conviction
that
all
these
things
were
the
result
of
a
steady
progress
through
long
epochs
on
a
similar
plan
southall
proposed
at
the
very
beginning
of
his
book
as
a
final
solution
of
the
problem
the
declaration
that
egypt
with
its
high
civilization
in
the
time
of
mena
with
its
races
classes
institutions
arrangements
language
monuments
all
indicating
an
evolution
through
a
vast
previous
history
was
a
sudden
creation
which
came
fully
made
from
the
hands
of
the
creator
to
use
his
own
words
the
egyptians
had
no
stone
age
and
were
born
civilized
there
is
an
old
story
that
once
on
a
time
a
certain
jovial
king
of
france
making
a
progress
through
his
kingdom
was
received
at
the
gates
of
a
provincial
town
by
the
mayor
deputy
who
began
his
speech
on
this
wise
may
it
please
your
majesty
there
are
just
thirteen
reasons
why
his
honour
the
mayor
can
not
be
present
to
welcome
you
this
morning
the
first
of
these
reasons
is
that
he
is
dead
on
this
the
king
graciously
declared
that
this
first
reason
was
sufficient
and
that
he
would
not
trouble
the
mayor
deputy
for
the
twelve
others
so
with
southall
argument
one
simple
result
of
scientific
research
out
of
many
is
all
that
it
is
needful
to
state
and
this
is
that
in
these
later
years
we
have
a
new
and
convincing
evidence
of
the
existence
of
prehistoric
man
in
egypt
in
his
earliest
rudest
beginnings
the
very
same
evidence
which
we
find
in
all
other
parts
of
the
world
which
have
been
carefully
examined
this
evidence
consists
of
stone
implements
and
weapons
which
have
been
found
in
egypt
in
such
forms
at
such
points
and
in
such
positions
that
when
studied
in
connection
with
those
found
in
all
other
parts
of
the
world
from
new
jersey
to
california
from
france
to
india
and
from
england
to
the
andaman
islands
they
force
upon
us
the
conviction
that
civilization
in
egypt
as
in
all
other
parts
of
the
world
was
developed
by
the
same
slow
process
of
evolution
from
the
rudest
beginnings
it
is
true
that
men
learned
in
egyptology
had
discouraged
the
idea
of
an
earlier
stone
age
in
egypt
and
that
among
these
were
lepsius
and
brugsch
but
these
men
were
not
trained
in
prehistoric
archaeology
their
devotion
to
the
study
of
the
monuments
of
egyptian
civilization
had
evidently
drawn
them
away
from
sympathy
and
indeed
from
acquaintance
with
the
work
of
men
like
boucher
de
perthes
lartet
nilsson
troyon
and
dawkins
but
a
new
era
was
beginning
in
worsaae
called
attention
to
the
prehistoric
implements
found
on
the
borders
of
egypt
two
years
later
arcelin
discussed
such
stone
implements
found
beneath
the
soil
of
sakkara
and
gizeh
the
very
focus
of
the
earliest
egyptian
civilization
in
the
same
year
hamy
and
lenormant
found
such
implements
washed
out
from
the
depths
higher
up
the
nile
at
thebes
near
the
tombs
of
the
kings
and
in
the
following
year
they
exhibited
more
flint
implements
found
at
various
other
places
coupled
with
these
discoveries
was
the
fact
that
horner
and
linant
found
a
copper
knife
at
feet
and
pottery
at
sixty
feet
below
the
surface
in
reil
director
of
the
baths
at
helouan
near
cairo
discovered
implements
of
chipped
flint
and
in
jukes
brown
made
similar
discoveries
in
that
region
in
oscar
fraas
summing
up
the
question
showed
that
the
stone
implements
were
mainly
such
as
are
found
in
the
prehistoric
deposits
of
other
countries
and
that
zittel
having
found
them
in
the
libyan
desert
far
from
the
oases
there
was
reason
to
suppose
that
these
implements
were
used
before
the
region
became
a
desert
and
before
egypt
was
civilized
two
years
later
mook
of
wurzburg
published
a
work
giving
the
results
of
his
investigations
with
careful
drawings
of
the
rude
stone
implements
discovered
by
him
in
the
upper
nile
valley
and
it
was
evident
that
while
some
of
these
implements
differed
slightly
from
those
before
known
the
great
mass
of
them
were
of
the
character
so
common
in
the
prehistoric
deposits
of
other
parts
of
the
world
a
yet
more
important
contribution
to
this
mass
of
facts
was
made
by
henry
haynes
of
boston
who
in
the
winter
of
and
began
a
very
thorough
investigation
of
the
subject
and
discovered
a
few
miles
east
of
cairo
many
flint
implements
the
significance
of
discoveries
was
twofold
first
there
were
among
these
stone
axes
like
those
found
in
the
french
drift
beds
of
acheul
showing
that
the
men
who
made
or
taught
men
how
to
make
these
in
egypt
were
passing
through
the
same
phase
of
savagery
as
that
of
quaternary
france
secondly
he
found
a
workshop
for
making
these
implements
proving
that
these
flint
implements
were
not
brought
into
egypt
by
invaders
but
were
made
to
meet
the
necessities
of
the
country
from
this
first
field
haynes
went
to
helouan
north
of
cairo
and
there
found
as
reil
had
done
various
worked
flints
some
of
them
like
those
discovered
by
riviere
in
the
caves
of
southern
france
thence
he
went
up
the
nile
to
luxor
the
site
of
ancient
thebes
began
a
thorough
search
in
the
tertiary
limestone
hills
and
found
multitudes
of
chipped
stone
implements
some
of
them
indeed
of
original
forms
but
most
of
forms
common
in
other
parts
of
the
world
under
similar
circumstances
some
of
the
chipped
stone
axes
corresponding
closely
to
those
found
in
the
drift
beds
of
northern
france
all
this
seemed
to
show
conclusively
that
long
ages
before
the
earliest
period
of
egyptian
civilization
of
which
the
monuments
of
the
first
dynasties
give
us
any
trace
mankind
in
the
nile
valley
was
going
through
the
same
slow
progress
from
the
period
when
standing
just
above
the
brutes
he
defended
himself
with
implements
of
rudely
chipped
stone
but
in
came
discoveries
which
settled
the
question
entirely
in
that
year
general
a
fellow
of
the
royal
society
and
president
of
the
anthropological
institute
and
campbell
fellow
of
the
royal
geographical
society
of
england
found
implements
not
only
in
alluvial
deposits
associated
with
the
bones
of
the
zebra
hyena
and
other
animals
which
have
since
retreated
farther
south
but
at
djebel
assas
near
thebes
they
found
implements
of
chipped
flint
in
the
hard
stratified
gravel
from
six
and
a
half
to
ten
feet
below
the
surface
relics
evidently
as
campbell
says
beyond
calculation
older
than
the
oldest
egyptian
temples
and
tombs
they
certainly
proved
that
egyptian
civilization
had
not
issued
in
its
completeness
and
all
at
once
from
the
hand
of
the
creator
in
the
time
of
mena
nor
was
this
all
investigators
of
the
highest
character
and
ability
men
like
hull
and
flinders
petrie
revealed
geological
changes
in
egypt
requiring
enormous
periods
of
time
and
traces
of
man
handiwork
dating
from
a
period
when
the
waters
in
the
nile
valley
extended
hundreds
of
feet
above
the
present
level
thus
was
ended
the
contention
of
southall
still
another
attack
upon
the
new
scientific
conclusions
came
from
france
when
in
the
abbe
hamard
priest
of
the
oratory
published
his
age
of
stone
and
primitive
man
he
had
been
especially
vexed
at
the
arrangement
of
prehistoric
implements
by
periods
at
the
paris
exposition
of
he
bitterly
complains
of
this
as
having
an
tendency
and
rails
at
science
as
the
idol
of
the
day
he
attacks
mortillet
one
of
the
leaders
in
french
archaeology
with
a
great
display
of
contempt
speaks
of
the
venom
in
books
on
prehistoric
man
generally
complains
that
the
church
is
too
mild
and
gentle
with
such
monstrous
doctrines
bewails
the
concessions
made
to
science
by
some
eminent
preachers
and
foretells
his
own
martyrdom
at
the
hands
of
men
of
science
efforts
like
this
accomplished
little
and
a
more
legitimate
attempt
was
made
to
resist
the
conclusions
of
archaeology
by
showing
that
knives
of
stone
were
used
in
obedience
to
a
sacred
ritual
in
egypt
for
embalming
and
in
judea
for
circumcision
and
that
these
flint
knives
might
have
had
this
later
origin
but
the
argument
against
the
conclusions
drawn
from
this
view
was
triple
first
as
we
have
seen
not
only
stone
knives
but
axes
and
other
implements
of
stone
similar
to
those
of
a
prehistoric
period
in
western
europe
were
discovered
secondly
these
implements
were
discovered
in
the
hard
gravel
drift
of
a
period
evidently
far
earlier
than
that
of
mena
and
thirdly
the
use
of
stone
implements
in
egyptian
and
jewish
sacred
functions
within
the
historic
period
so
far
from
weakening
the
force
of
the
arguments
for
the
long
and
slow
development
of
egyptian
civilization
from
the
men
who
used
rude
flint
implements
to
the
men
who
built
and
adorned
the
great
temples
of
the
early
dynasties
is
really
an
argument
in
favour
of
that
long
evolution
a
study
of
comparative
ethnology
has
made
it
clear
that
the
sacred
stone
knives
and
implements
of
the
egyptian
and
jewish
priestly
ritual
were
natural
survivals
of
that
previous
period
for
sacrificial
or
ritual
purposes
the
knife
of
stone
was
considered
more
sacred
than
the
knife
of
bronze
or
iron
simply
because
it
was
ancient
just
as
in
india
brahman
priests
kindle
the
sacred
fire
not
with
matches
or
flint
and
steel
but
by
a
process
found
in
the
earliest
lowest
stages
of
human
culture
by
violently
boring
a
pointed
stick
into
another
piece
of
wood
until
a
spark
comes
and
just
as
in
europe
and
america
the
architecture
of
the
middle
ages
survives
as
a
special
religious
form
in
the
erection
of
our
most
recent
churches
and
to
such
an
extent
that
thousands
on
thousands
of
us
feel
that
we
can
not
worship
fitly
unless
in
the
midst
of
windows
decorations
vessels
implements
vestments
and
ornaments
no
longer
used
for
other
purposes
but
which
have
survived
in
sundry
branches
of
the
christian
church
and
derived
a
special
sanctity
from
the
fact
that
they
are
of
ancient
origin
taking
then
the
whole
mass
of
testimony
together
even
though
a
plausible
or
very
strong
argument
against
single
evidences
may
be
made
here
and
there
the
force
of
its
combined
mass
remains
and
leaves
both
the
vast
antiquity
of
man
and
the
evolution
of
civilization
from
its
lowest
to
its
highest
forms
as
proved
by
the
prehistoric
remains
of
egypt
and
so
many
other
countries
in
all
parts
of
the
world
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
most
important
of
all
the
recent
discoveries
in
assyria
have
thrown
a
new
light
upon
the
evolution
of
the
dogma
of
the
fall
of
man
reverent
scholars
like
george
smith
sayce
delitzsch
jensen
schrader
and
their
compeers
have
found
in
the
ninevite
records
the
undoubted
source
of
that
form
of
the
fall
legend
which
was
adopted
by
the
hebrews

them

egypt
at

passed

its

chapter

the
fall
of
man
and
ethnology
we
have
seen
that
closely
connected
with
the
main
lines
of
investigation
in
archaeology
and
anthropology
there
were
other
researches
throwing
much
light
on
the
entire
subject
in
a
previous
chapter
we
saw
especially
that
lafitau
and
jussieu
were
among
the
first
to
collect
and
compare
facts
bearing
on
the
natural
history
of
man
gathered
by
travellers
in
various
parts
of
the
earth
thus
laying
foundations
for
the
science
of
comparative
ethnology
it
was
soon
seen
that
ethnology
had
most
important
bearings
upon
the
question
of
the
material
intellectual
moral
and
religious
evolution
of
the
human
race
in
every
civilized
nation
therefore
appeared
scholars
who
began
to
study
the
characteristics
of
various
groups
of
men
as
ascertained
from
travellers
and
to
compare
the
results
thus
gained
with
each
other
and
with
those
obtained
by
archaeology
thus
more
and
more
clear
became
the
evidences
that
the
tendency
of
the
race
has
been
upward
from
low
beginnings
it
was
found
that
groups
of
men
still
existed
possessing
characteristics
of
those
in
the
early
periods
of
development
to
whom
the
drift
and
caves
and
and
bear
witness
groups
of
men
using
many
of
the
same
implements
and
weapons
building
their
houses
in
the
same
way
seeking
their
food
by
the
same
means
enjoying
the
same
amusements
and
going
through
the
same
general
stages
of
culture
some
being
in
a
condition
corresponding
to
the
earlier
some
to
the
later
of
those
early
periods
from
all
sides
thus
came
evidence
that
we
have
still
upon
the
earth
examples
of
all
the
main
stages
in
the
development
of
human
civilization
that
from
the
period
when
man
appears
little
above
the
brutes
and
with
little
if
any
religion
in
any
accepted
sense
of
the
word
these
examples
can
be
arranged
in
an
ascending
series
leading
to
the
highest
planes
which
humanity
has
reached
that
philosophic
observers
may
among
these
examples
study
existing
beliefs
usages
and
institutions
back
through
earlier
and
earlier
forms
until
as
a
rule
the
whole
evolution
can
be
easily
divined
if
not
fully
seen
moreover
the
basis
of
the
whole
structure
became
more
and
more
clear
the
fact
that
the
lines
of
intelligence
have
always
been
what
they
are
and
have
always
operated
as
they
do
now
that
man
has
progressed
from
the
simple
to
the
complex
from
the
particular
to
the
general
as
this
evidence
from
ethnology
became
more
and
more
strong
its
significance
to
theology
aroused
attention
and
naturally
most
determined
efforts
were
made
to
break
its
force
on
the
continent
the
two
great
champions
of
the
church
in
this
field
were
de
maistre
and
de
bonald
but
the
two
attempts
which
may
be
especially
recalled
as
the
most
influential
among
peoples
were
those
of
whately
archbishop
of
dublin
and
the
duke
of
argyll
first
in
the
combat
against
these
new
deductions
of
science
was
whately
he
was
a
strong
man
whose
breadth
of
thought
and
liberality
in
practice
deserve
all
honour
but
these
very
qualities
drew
upon
him
the
distrust
of
his
orthodox
brethren
and
while
his
writings
were
powerful
in
the
first
half
of
the
present
century
to
break
down
many
bulwarks
of
unreason
he
seems
to
have
been
constantly
in
fear
of
losing
touch
with
the
church
and
therefore
to
have
promptly
attacked
some
scientific
reasonings
which
had
he
been
a
layman
not
holding
a
brief
for
the
church
he
would
probably
have
studied
with
more
care
and
less
prejudice
he
was
not
slow
to
see
the
deeper
significance
of
archaeology
and
ethnology
in
their
relations
to
the
theological
conception
of
the
fall
and
he
set
the
battle
in
array
against
them
his
contention
was
to
use
his
own
words
that
no
community
ever
did
or
ever
can
emerge
unassisted
by
external
helps
from
a
state
of
utter
barbarism
into
anything
that
can
be
called
civilization
and
that
in
short
all
imperfectly
civilized
barbarous
and
savage
races
are
but
fallen
descendants
of
races
more
fully
civilized
this
view
was
urged
with
his
usual
ingenuity
and
vigour
but
the
facts
proved
too
strong
for
him
they
made
it
clear
first
that
many
races
were
without
simple
possessions
instruments
and
arts
which
never
probably
could
have
been
lost
if
once
acquired
as
for
example
pottery
the
bow
for
shooting
various
domesticated
animals
spinning
the
simplest
principles
of
agriculture
household
economy
and
the
like
and
secondly
it
was
shown
as
a
simple
matter
of
fact
that
various
savage
and
barbarous
tribes
had
raised
themselves
by
a
development
of
means
which
no
one
from
outside
could
have
taught
them
as
in
the
cultivation
and
improvement
of
various
indigenous
plants
such
as
the
potato
and
indian
corn
among
the
indians
of
north
america
in
the
domestication
of
various
animals
peculiar
to
their
own
regions
such
as
the
llama
among
the
indians
of
south
america
in
the
making
of
sundry
fabrics
out
of
materials
and
by
processes
not
found
among
other
nations
such
as
the
bark
cloth
of
the
polynesians
and
in
the
development
of
weapons
peculiar
to
sundry
localities
but
known
in
no
others
such
as
the
boomerang
in
australia
most
effective
in
bringing
out
the
truth
were
such
works
as
those
of
sir
john
lubbock
and
tylor
and
so
conclusive
were
they
that
the
arguments
of
whately
were
given
up
as
untenable
by
the
other
of
the
two
great
champions
above
referred
to
and
an
attempt
was
made
by
him
to
form
the
diminishing
number
of
thinking
men
supporting
the
old
theological
view
on
a
new
line
of
defence
this
second
champion
the
duke
of
argyll
was
a
man
of
wide
knowledge
and
strong
powers
in
debate
whose
high
moral
sense
was
amply
shown
in
his
adhesion
to
the
side
of
the
american
union
in
the
struggle
against
disunion
and
slavery
despite
the
overwhelming
majority
against
him
in
the
high
aristocracy
to
which
he
belonged
as
an
honest
man
and
close
thinker
the
duke
was
obliged
to
give
up
completely
the
theological
view
of
the
antiquity
of
man
the
whole
biblical
chronology
as
held
by
the
universal
church
always
everywhere
and
by
all
he
sacrificed
and
gave
all
his
powers
in
this
field
to
support
the
theory
of
the
fall
noblesse
oblige
the
duke
and
his
ancestors
had
been
for
centuries
the
chief
pillars
of
the
church
of
scotland
and
it
was
too
much
to
expect
that
he
could
break
away
from
a
tenet
which
forms
really
its
chief
cornerstone
acknowledging
the
insufficiency
of
archbishop
whately
argument
the
duke
took
the
ground
that
the
lower
barbarous
savage
brutal
races
were
the
remains
of
civilized
races
which
in
the
struggle
for
existence
had
been
pushed
and
driven
off
to
remote
and
inclement
parts
of
the
earth
where
the
conditions
necessary
to
a
continuance
in
their
early
civilization
were
absent
that
therefore
the
descendants
of
primeval
civilized
men
degenerated
and
sank
in
the
scale
of
culture
to
use
his
own
words
the
weaker
races
were
driven
by
the
stronger
to
the
woods
and
rocks
so
that
they
became
mere
outcasts
of
the
human
race
in
answer
to
this
while
it
was
conceded
first
that
there
have
been
examples
of
weaker
tribes
sinking
in
the
scale
of
culture
after
escaping
from
the
stronger
into
regions
unfavourable
to
civilization
and
secondly
that
many
powerful
nations
have
declined
and
decayed
it
was
shown
that
the
men
in
the
most
remote
and
unfavourable
regions
have
not
always
been
the
lowest
in
the
scale
that
men
have
been
frequently
found
among
the
woods
and
rocks
in
a
higher
state
of
civilization
than
on
the
fertile
plains
such
examples
being
cited
as
mexico
peru
and
even
scotland
and
that
while
there
were
many
examples
of
special
and
local
decline
overwhelming
masses
of
facts
point
to
progress
as
a
rule
the
improbability
not
to
say
impossibility
of
many
of
the
conclusions
arrived
at
by
the
duke
appeared
more
and
more
strongly
as
more
became
known
of
the
lower
tribes
of
mankind
it
was
necessary
on
his
theory
to
suppose
many
things
which
our
knowledge
of
the
human
race
absolutely
forbids
us
to
believe
for
example
it
was
necessary
to
suppose
that
the
australians
or
new
zealanders
having
once
possessed
so
simple
and
convenient
an
art
as
that
of
the
potter
had
lost
every
trace
of
it
and
that
the
same
tribes
having
once
had
so
simple
a
means
of
saving
labour
as
the
spindle
or
small
stick
weighted
at
one
end
for
spinning
had
given
it
up
and
gone
back
to
twisting
threads
with
the
hand
in
fact
it
was
necessary
to
suppose
that
one
of
the
main
occupations
of
man
from
the
beginning
had
been
the
forgetting
of
simple
methods
processes
and
implements
which
all
experience
in
the
actual
world
teaches
us
are
never
entirely
forgotten
by
peoples
who
have
once
acquired
them
some
leading
arguments
of
the
duke
were
overthrown
by
simple
statements
of
fact
thus
his
instance
of
the
eskimo
as
pushed
to
the
verge
of
habitable
america
and
therefore
living
in
the
lowest
depths
of
savagery
which
even
if
it
were
true
by
no
means
proved
a
general
rule
was
deprived
of
its
force
by
the
simple
fact
that
the
eskimos
are
by
no
means
the
lowest
race
on
the
american
continent
and
that
various
tribes
far
more
centrally
and
advantageously
placed
as
for
instance
those
in
brazil
are
really
inferior
to
them
in
the
scale
of
culture
again
his
statement
that
in
africa
there
appear
to
be
no
traces
of
any
time
when
the
natives
were
not
acquainted
with
the
use
of
iron
is
met
by
the
fact
that
from
the
nile
valley
to
the
cape
of
good
hope
we
find
wherever
examination
has
been
made
the
same
early
stone
implements
which
in
all
other
parts
of
the
world
precede
the
use
of
iron
some
of
which
would
not
have
been
made
had
their
makers
possessed
iron
the
duke
also
tried
to
show
that
there
were
no
distinctive
epochs
of
stone
bronze
and
iron
by
adducing
the
fact
that
some
stone
implements
are
found
even
in
some
high
civilizations
this
is
indeed
a
fact
we
find
some
few
european
peasants
using
stone
but
this
proves
simply
that
the
old
stone
have
survived
as
implements
cheap
and
effective
the
argument
from
comparative
ethnology
in
support
of
the
view
that
the
tendency
of
mankind
is
upward
has
received
strength
from
many
sources
comparative
philology
shows
that
in
the
less
civilized
barbarous
and
savage
races
childish
forms
of
speech
prevail
frequent
reduplications
and
the
like
of
which
we
have
survivals
in
the
later
and
even
in
the
most
highly
developed
languages
in
various
languages
too
we
find
relics
of
ancient
modes
of
thought
in
the
simplest
words
and
expressions
used
for
arithmetical
calculations
words
and
phrases
for
this
purpose
are
frequently
found
to
be
derived
from
the
words
for
hands
feet
fingers
and
toes
just
as
clearly
as
in
our
own
language
some
of
our
simplest
measures
of
length
are
shown
by
their
names
to
have
been
measures
of
parts
of
the
human
body
as
the
cubit
the
foot
and
the
like
and
therefore
to
date
from
a
time
when
exactness
was
not
required
to
add
another
out
of
many
examples
it
is
found
that
various
rude
nations
go
through
the
simplest
arithmetical
processes
by
means
of
pebbles
into
our
own
language
through
the
latin
has
come
a
word
showing
that
our
distant
progenitors
reckoned
in
this
way
the
word
calculate
gives
us
an
absolute
proof
of
this
according
to
the
theory
of
the
duke
of
argyll
men
ages
ago
used
pebbles
calculi
in
performing
the
simplest
arithmetical
calculations
because
we
calculate
no
reduction
to
absurdity
could
be
more
thorough
the
simple
fact
must
be
that
we
calculate
because
our
remote
ancestors
used
pebbles
in
their
arithmetic
comparative
literature
and
folklore
also
show
among
peoples
of
a
low
culture
childish
modes
of
viewing
nature
and
childish
ways
of
expressing
the
relations
of
man
to
nature
such
as
clearly
survive
from
a
remote
ancestry
noteworthy
among
these
are
the
beliefs
in
witches
and
fairies
and
multitudes
of
popular
and
poetic
expressions
in
the
most
civilized
nations
so
too
comparative
ethnography
the
basis
of
ethnology
shows
in
contemporary
barbarians
and
savages
a
childish
love
of
playthings
and
games
of
which
we
have
many
survivals
all
these
facts
which
were
at
first
unobserved
or
observed
as
matters
of
no
significance
have
been
brought
into
connection
with
a
fact
in
biology
acknowledged
alike
by
all
important
schools
by
agassiz
on
one
hand
and
by
darwin
on
the
other
namely
as
stated
by
agassiz
that
the
young
states
of
each
species
and
group
resemble
older
forms
of
the
same
group
or
as
stated
by
darwin
that
in
two
or
more
groups
of
animals
however
much
they
may
at
first
differ
from
each
other
in
structure
and
habits
if
they
pass
through
closely
similar
embryonic
stages
we
may
feel
almost
assured
that
they
have
descended
from
the
same
parent
form
and
are
therefore
closely
related

from

the
development
of
man
in
the
prehistoric
period
from
his
development
within
historic
times
nothing
is
more
evident
from
history
than
the
fact
that
weaker
bodies
of
men
driven
out
by
stronger
do
not
necessarily
relapse
into
barbarism
but
frequently
rise
even
under
the
most
unfavourable
circumstances
to
a
civilization
equal
or
superior
to
that
from
which
they
have
been
banished
out
of
very
many
examples
showing
this
law
of
upward
development
a
few
may
be
taken
as
typical
the
slavs
who
sank
so
low
under
the
pressure
of
stronger
races
that
they
gave
the
modern
world
a
new
word
to
express
the
most
hopeless
servitude
have
developed
powerful
civilizations
peculiar
to
themselves
the
barbarian
tribes
who
ages
ago
took
refuge
amid
the
and
morasses
of
holland
have
developed
one
of
the
world
leading
centres
of
civilization
the
wretched
peasants
who
about
the
fifth
century
took
refuge
from
invading
hordes
among
the
lagoons
and
mud
banks
of
venetia
developed
a
power
in
art
arms
and
politics
which
is
among
the
wonders
of
human
history
the
puritans
driven
from
the
civilization
of
great
britain
to
the
unfavourable
climate
soil
and
circumstances
of
early
new
england
the
huguenots
driven
from
france
a
country
admirably
fitted
for
the
highest
growth
of
civilization
to
various
countries
far
less
fitted
for
such
growth
the
irish
peasantry
driven
in
vast
numbers
from
their
own
island
to
other
parts
of
the
world
on
the
whole
less
fitted
to
them
all
are
proofs
that
as
a
rule
bodies
of
men
once
enlightened
when
driven
to
unfavourable
climates
and
brought
under
the
most
depressing
circumstances
not
only
retain
what
enlightenment
they
have
but
go
on
increasing
it
besides
these
we
have
such
cases
as
those
of
criminals
banished
to
various
penal
colonies
from
whose
descendants
has
been
developed
a
better
morality
and
of
pirates
like
those
of
the
bounty
whose
descendants
in
a
remote
pacific
island
became
sober
steady
citizens
thousands
of
examples
show
the
prevalence
of
this
same
rule
that
men
in
masses
do
not
forget
the
main
gains
of
their
civilization
and
that
in
spite
of
deteriorations
their
tendency
is
upward
another
class
of
historic
facts
also
testifies
in
the
most
striking
manner
to
this
same
upward
tendency
the
decline
and
destruction
of
various
civilizations
brilliant
but
hopelessly
vitiated
these
catastrophes
are
seen
more
and
more
to
be
but
steps
in
this
development
the
crumbling
away
of
the
great
ancient
civilizations
based
upon
despotism
whether
the
despotism
of
monarch
priest
or
mob
the
decline
and
fall
of
roman
civilization
for
example
which
in
his
most
remarkable
generalization
guizot
has
shown
to
have
been
necessary
to
the
development
of
the
richer
civilization
of
modern
europe
the
terrible
struggle
and
loss
of
the
crusades
which
once
appeared
to
be
a
mere
catastrophe
but
are
now
seen
to
have
brought
in
with
the
downfall
of
feudalism
the
beginnings
of
the
centralizing
civilizing
monarchical
period
the
french
revolution
once
thought
a
mere
outburst
of
diabolic
passion
but
now
seen
to
be
an
unduly
delayed
transition
from
the
monarchical
to
the
constitutional
epoch
all
show
that
even
widespread
deterioration
and
decline
often
indeed
the
greatest
political
and
moral
catastrophes
so
far
from
leading
to
a
fall
of
mankind
tend
in
the
long
run
to
raise
humanity
to
higher
planes
thus
then
anthropology
and
its
handmaids
ethnology
philology
and
history
have
wrought
out
beyond
a
doubt
proofs
of
the
upward
evolution
of
humanity
since
the
appearance
of
man
upon
our
planet
nor
have
these
researches
been
confined
to
progress
in
man
material
condition
far
more
important
evidences
have
been
found
of
upward
evolution
in
his
family
social
moral
intellectual
and
religious
relations
the
light
thrown
on
this
subject
by
such
men
as
lubbock
tylor
herbert
spencer
buckle
draper
max
muller
and
a
multitude
of
others
despite
mistakes
haltings
stumblings
and
occasional
following
of
delusive
paths
is
among
the
greatest
glories
of
the
century
now
ending
from
all
these
investigators
in
their
various
fields
holding
no
brief
for
any
system
sacred
or
secular
but
seeking
truth
as
truth
comes
the
same
general
testimony
of
the
evolution
of
higher
out
of
lower
the
process
has
been
indeed
slow
and
painful
but
this
does
not
prove
that
it
may
not
become
more
rapid
and
less
fruitful
in
sorrow
as
humanity
goes
on
as
to
the
good
effects
of
migration
see
waitz
introduction
to
anthropology
london
while
then
it
is
not
denied
that
many
instances
of
retrogression
can
be
found
the
consenting
voice
of
unbiased
investigators
in
all
lands
has
declared
more
and
more
that
the
beginnings
of
our
race
must
have
been
low
and
brutal
and
that
the
tendency
has
been
upward
to
combat
this
conclusion
by
examples
of
decline
and
deterioration
here
and
there
has
become
impossible
as
well
try
to
prove
that
because
in
the
mississippi
there
are
eddies
in
which
the
currents
flow
northward
there
is
no
main
stream
flowing
southward
or
that
because
trees
decay
and
fall
there
is
no
law
of
upward
growth
from
germ
to
trunk
branches
foliage
and
fruit
a
very
striking
evidence
that
the
theological
theory
had
become
untenable
was
seen
when
its
main
supporter
in
the
scientific
field
von
martius
in
the
full
ripeness
of
his
powers
publicly
declared
his
conversion
to
the
scientific
view
yet
while
the
tendency
of
enlightened
human
thought
in
recent
times
is
unmistakable
the
struggle
against
the
older
view
is
not
yet
ended
the
bitterness
of
the
abbe
hamard
in
france
has
been
carried
to
similar
and
even
greater
extremes
among
sundry
protestant
bodies
in
europe
and
america
the
simple
truth
of
history
mates
it
a
necessity
unpleasant
though
it
be
to
chronicle
two
typical
examples
in
the
united
states
in
the
year
a
leader
in
american
industrial
enterprise
endowed
at
the
capital
of
a
southern
state
a
university
which
bore
his
name
it
was
given
into
the
hands
of
one
of
the
religious
sects
most
powerful
in
that
region
and
a
bishop
of
that
sect
became
its
president
to
its
chair
of
geology
was
called
alexander
winchell
a
scholar
who
had
already
won
eminence
as
a
teacher
and
writer
in
that
field
a
professor
greatly
beloved
and
respected
in
the
two
universities
with
which
he
had
been
connected
and
a
member
of
the
sect
which
the
institution
of
learning
above
referred
to
represented
but
his
relations
to
this
southern
institution
were
destined
to
be
brief
that
his
lectures
at
the
vanderbilt
university
were
learned
attractive
and
stimulating
even
his
enemies
were
forced
to
admit
but
he
was
soon
found
to
believe
that
there
had
been
men
earlier
than
the
period
as
signed
to
adam
and
even
that
all
the
human
race
are
not
descended
from
adam
his
desire
was
to
reconcile
science
and
scripture
and
he
was
now
treated
by
a
methodist
episcopal
bishop
in
tennessee
just
as
two
centuries
before
la
peyrere
had
been
treated
for
a
similar
effort
by
a
roman
catholic
in
belgium
the
publication
of
a
series
of
articles
on
the
subject
contributed
by
the
professor
to
a
northern
religious
newspaper
at
its
own
request
brought
matters
to
a
climax
for
the
articles
having
fallen
under
the
notice
of
a
leading
southwestern
organ
of
the
denomination
controlling
the
vanderbilt
university
the
result
was
a
most
bitter
denunciation
of
winchell
and
of
his
views
shortly
afterward
the
professor
was
told
by
bishop
mctyeire
that
our
people
are
of
the
opinion
that
such
views
are
contrary
to
the
plan
of
redemption
and
was
requested
by
the
bishop
to
quietly
resign
his
chair
to
this
the
professor
made
the
fitting
reply
if
the
board
of
trustees
have
the
manliness
to
dismiss
me
for
cause
and
declare
the
cause
i
prefer
that
they
should
do
it
no
power
on
earth
could
persuade
me
to
resign
we
do
not
propose
said
the
bishop
with
quite
gratuitous
suggestiveness
to
treat
you
as
the
inquisition
treated
galileo
but
what
you
propose
is
the
same
thing
rejoined
winchell
it
is
ecclesiastical
proscription
for
an
opinion
which
must
be
settled
by
scientific
evidence
hours
later
winchell
was
informed
that
his
chair
had
been
abolished
and
its
duties
with
its
salary
added
to
those
of
a
colleague
the
public
were
given
to
understand
that
the
reasons
were
purely
economic
the
banished
scholar
was
heaped
with
official
compliments
evidently
in
hope
that
he
would
keep
silence
such
was
not
winchell
view
in
a
frank
letter
to
the
leading
journal
of
the
university
town
he
stated
the
whole
matter
the
press
of
the
country
religious
and
secular
did
not
hold
its
peace
in
vain
the
authorities
of
the
university
waited
for
the
storm
to
blow
over
it
was
evident
at
last
that
a
defence
must
be
made
and
a
local
organ
of
the
sect
which
under
the
editorship
of
a
had
always
treated
winchell
views
with
the
luminous
inaccuracy
which
usually
characterizes
a
professor
ideas
of
a
rival
teachings
assumed
the
task
in
the
articles
which
followed
the
usual
scientific
hypotheses
as
to
the
creation
were
declared
to
be
absurd
vague
and
unintelligible
preposterous
and
gratuitous
this
new
champion
stated
that
the
objections
drawn
from
the
fossiliferous
strata
and
the
like
are
met
by
reference
to
the
analogy
of
adam
and
eve
who
presented
the
phenomena
of
adults
when
they
were
but
a
day
old
and
by
the
flood
of
noah
and
other
cataclysms
which
with
the
constant
change
of
nature
are
sufficient
to
account
for
the
phenomena
in
question
under
inspiration
of
this
sort
the
tennessee
conference
of
the
religious
body
in
control
of
the
university
had
already
in
october
given
utterance
to
its
opinion
of
unsanctified
science
as
follows
this
is
an
age
in
which
scientific
atheism
having
divested
itself
of
the
habiliments
that
most
adorn
and
dignify
humanity
walks
abroad
in
shameless
denudation
the
arrogant
and
impertinent
claims
of
this
falsely
so
called
have
been
so
boisterous
and
persistent
that
the
unthinking
mass
have
been
sadly
deluded
but
our
university
alone
has
had
the
courage
to
lay
its
young
but
vigorous
hand
upon
the
mane
of
untamed
speculation
and
say
will
have
no
more
of
this
it
is
a
consolation
to
know
how
the
result
thus
devoutly
sought
has
been
achieved
for
in
the
ode
sung
at
the
laying
of
the
of
a
new
theological
building
of
the
same
university
in
may
we
read
science
and
revelation
here
in
perfect
harmony
appear
guiding
young
feet
along
the
road
through
grace
and
nature
up
to
god
it
is
also
pleasing
to
know
that
while
an
institution
calling
itself
a
university
thus
violated
the
fundamental
principles
on
which
any
institution
worthy
of
the
name
must
be
based
another
institution
which
has
the
glory
of
being
the
first
in
the
entire
north
to
begin
something
like
a
university
organization
the
state
university
of
michigan
recalled
winchell
at
once
to
his
former
professorship
and
honoured
itself
by
maintaining
him
in
that
position
where
unhampered
he
was
thereafter
able
to
utter
his
views
in
the
midst
of
the
largest
body
of
students
on
the
american
continent
disgraceful
as
this
history
was
to
the
men
who
drove
out
winchell
they
but
succeeded
as

similar
bodies

years
after
this
suppression
of
earnest

thought
at
an
institution
of
learning
in
the
western
part
of
our
southern
states
there
appeared
a
similar
attempt
in
sundry
seaboard
states
of
the
south
as
far
back
as
the
year
the
presbyterian
synod
of
mississippi
passed
the
following
resolution
whereas
we
live
in
an
age
in
which
the
most
insidious
attacks
are
made
on
revealed
religion
through
the
natural
sciences
and
as
it
behooves
the
church
at
all
times
to
have
men
capable
of
defending
the
faith
once
delivered
to
the
saints
resolved
that
this
presbytery
recommend
the
endowment
of
a
professorship
of
natural
science
as
connected
with
revealed
religion
in
one
or
more
of
our
theological
seminaries
pursuant
to
this
resolution
such
a
chair
was
established
in
the
theological
seminary
at
columbia
and
james
woodrow
was
appointed
professor
woodrow
seems
to
have
been
admirably
fitted
for
the
position
a
devoted
christian
man
accepting
the
presbyterian
standards
of
faith
in
which
he
had
been
brought
up
and
at
the
same
time
giving
every
effort
to
acquaint
himself
with
the
methods
and
conclusions
of
science
to
great
natural
endowments
he
added
constant
labours
to
arrive
at
the
truth
in
this
field
visiting
europe
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
many
of
the
foremost
scientific
investigators
became
a
student
in
university
lecture
rooms
and
laboratories
an
interested
hearer
in
scientific
conventions
and
a
correspondent
of
leading
men
of
science
at
home
and
abroad
as
a
result
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
hypothesis
of
evolution
is
the
only
one
which
explains
various
leading
facts
in
natural
science
this
he
taught
and
he
also
taught
that
such
a
view
is
not
incompatible
with
a
true
view
of
the
sacred
scriptures
in
and
the
board
of
directors
of
the
theological
seminary
in
fear
that
scepticism
in
the
world
is
using
alleged
discoveries
in
science
to
impugn
the
word
of
god
requested
woodrow
to
state
his
views
in
regard
to
evolution
the
professor
complied
with
this
request
in
a
very
powerful
address
which
was
published
and
widely
circulated
to
such
effect
that
the
board
of
directors
shortly
afterward
passed
resolutions
declaring
the
theory
of
evolution
as
defined
by
woodrow
not
inconsistent
with
perfect
soundness
in
the
faith
in
the
year
alarm
regarding
woodrow
teachings
began
to
show
itself
in
larger
proportions
and
a
minority
report
was
introduced
into
the
synod
of
south
carolina
declaring
that
the
synod
is
called
upon
to
decide
not
upon
the
question
whether
the
said
views
of
woodrow
contradict
the
bible
in
its
highest
and
absolute
sense
but
upon
the
question
whether
they
contradict
the
interpretation
of
the
bible
by
the
presbyterian
church
in
the
united
states
perhaps
a
more
statement
was
never
presented
for
it
clearly
recognized
as
a
basis
for
intolerance
at
least
a
possible
difference
between
the
interpretation
of
the
bible
by
the
presbyterian
church
and
the
teachings
of
the
bible
in
its
highest
and
absolute
sense
this
hostile
movement
became
so
strong
that
in
spite
of
the
favourable
action
of
the
directors
of
the
seminary
and
against
the
efforts
of
a
minority
in
the
representative
bodies
having
ultimate
charge
of
the
institution
the
delegates
from
the
various
synods
raised
a
storm
of
orthodoxy
and
drove
woodrow
from
his
post
happily
he
was
at
the
same
time
professor
in
the
university
of
south
carolina
in
the
same
city
of
columbia
and
from
his
chair
in
that
institution
he
continued
to
teach
natural
science
with
the
approval
of
the
great
majority
of
thinking
men
in
that
region
hence
the
only
effect
of
the
attempt
to
crush
him
was
that
his
position
was
made
higher
respect
for
him
deeper
and
his
reputation
wider
in
spite
of
attempts
by
the
more
orthodox
to
prevent
students
of
the
theological
seminary
from
attending
his
lectures
at
the
university
they
persisted
in
hearing
him
indeed
the
reputation
of
heresy
seemed
to
enhance
his
influence
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
professor
thus
treated
had
been
one
of
the
most
respected
and
beloved
university
instructors
in
the
south
during
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
and
that
he
was
turned
out
of
his
position
with
no
opportunity
for
careful
defence
and
indeed
without
even
the
formality
of
a
trial
well
did
an
eminent
but
thoughtful
divine
of
the
southern
presbyterian
church
declare
that
the
method
of
procedure
to
destroy
evolution
by
the
majority
in
the
church
is
vicious
and
suicidal
and
that
logical
dynamite
has
been
used
to
put
out
a
supposed
fire
in
the
upper
stories
of
our
house
and
all
the
family
in
the
house
at
that
wisely
too
did
he
refer
to
the
majority
as
sowing
in
the
fields
of
the
church
the
thorns
of
its
errors
and
cumbering
its
path
with
the
debris
and
ruin
of
its
own
folly
to
these
recent
cases
may
be
added
the
expulsion
of
toy
from
teaching
under
ecclesiastical
control
at
louisville
and
his
election
to
a
far
more
influential
chair
at
harvard
university
the
driving
out
from
the
american
college
at
beyrout
of
the
young
professors
who
accepted
evolution
as
probable
and
the
rise
of
one
of
them
nimr
to
a
far
more
commanding
position
than
that
which
he
left
the
control
of
three
leading
journals
at
cairo
the
driving
out
of
robertson
smith
from
his
position
at
edinburgh
and
his
reception
into
the
far
more
important
and
influential
professorship
at
the
english
university
of
cambridge
and
multitudes
of
similar
cases
from
the
days
when
henry
dunster
the
first
president
of
harvard
college
was
driven
from
his
presidency
as
cotton
mather
said
for
falling
into
the
briers
of
antipedobaptism
until
now
the
same
spirit
is
shown
in
all
such
attempts
in
each
we
have
generally
on
one
side
a
body
of
older
theologians
who
since
their
youth
have
learned
nothing
and
forgotten
nothing
sundry
professors
who
do
not
wish
to
rewrite
their
lectures
and
a
mass
of
unthinking
ecclesiastical
persons
of
little
or
no
importance
save
in
making
up
a
retrograde
majority
in
an
ecclesiastical
tribunal
on
the
other
side
we
have
as
generally
the
thinking
devoted
men
who
have
listened
to
the
revelation
of
their
own
time
as
well
as
of
times
past
and
who
are
evidently
thinking
the
future
thought
of
the
world
here
we
have
survivals
of
that
same
oppression
of
thought
by
theology
which
has
cost
the
modern
world
so
dear
the
system
which
forced
great
numbers
of
professors
under
penalty
of
deprivation
to
teach
that
the
sun
and
planets
revolve
about
the
earth
that
comets
are
flung
by
an
angry
god
at
a
wicked
world
that
insanity
is
diabolic
possession
that
anatomical
investigation
of
the
human
frame
is
sin
against
the
holy
ghost
that
chemistry
leads
to
sorcery
that
taking
interest
for
money
is
forbidden
by
scripture
that
geology
must
conform
to
ancient
hebrew
poetry
from
the
same
source
came
in
austria
the
rule
of
the
immaculate
oath
under
which
university
professors
long
before
the
dogma
of
the
immaculate
conception
was
defined
by
the
church
were
obliged
to
swear
to
their
belief
in
that
dogma
before
they
were
permitted
to
teach
even
arithmetic
or
geometry
in
england
the
denunciation
of
inoculation
against
smallpox
in
scotland
the
protests
against
using
chloroform
in
childbirth
as
vitiating
the
primal
curse
against
woman
in
france
the
use
in
clerical
schools
of
a
historical
from
which
napoleon
was
left
out
and
in
america
the
use
of
catholic
manuals
in
which
the
inquisition
is
declared
to
have
been
a
purely
civil
tribunal
or
protestant
manuals
in
which
the
puritans
are
shown
to
have
been
all
that
we
could
now
wish
they
had
been
so
too
among
multitudes
of
similar
efforts
abroad
we
have
during
centuries
the
fettering
of
professors
at
english
and
scotch
universities
by
test
oaths
subscriptions
to
articles
and
catechisms
without
number
in
our
own
country
we
have
had
in
a
vast
multitude
of
denominational
colleges
as
the
first
qualification
for
a
professorship
not
ability
in
the
subject
to
be
taught
but
fidelity
to
the
particular
shibboleth
of
the
denomination
controlling
the
college
or
university
happily
in
these
days
such
attempts
generally
defeat
themselves
the
supposed
victim
is
generally
made
a
man
of
mark
by
persecution
and
advanced
to
a
higher
and
wider
sphere
of
usefulness
in
withstanding
the
march
of
scientific
truth
any
conference
synod
board
of
commissioners
board
of
trustees
or
faculty
is
but
as
a
nest
of
in
the
path
of
a
steam
plough
the
harm
done
to
religion
in
these
attempts
is
far
greater
than
that
done
to
science
for
thereby
suspicions
are
widely
spread
especially
among
young
men
that
the
accepted
christian
system
demands
a
concealment
of
truth
with
the
persecution
of
honest
investigators
and
therefore
must
be
false
well
was
it
said
in
substance
by
president
mccosh
of
princeton
that
no
more
sure
way
of
making
unbelievers
in
christianity
among
young
men
could
be
devised
than
preaching
to
them
that
the
doctrines
arrived
at
by
the
great
scientific
thinkers
of
this
period
are
opposed
to
religion
yet
it
is
but
justice
here
to
say
that
more
and
more
there
is
evolving
out
of
this
past
history
of
oppression
a
better
spirit
which
is
making
itself
manifest
with
power
in
the
leading
religious
bodies
of
the
world
in
the
church
of
rome
we
have
such
utterances
as
those
of
george
mivart
declaring
that
the
church
must
not
attempt
to
interfere
with
science
that
the
almighty
in
the
galileo
case
gave
her
a
distinct
warning
that
the
priesthood
of
science
must
remain
with
the
men
of
science
in
the
anglican
church
and
its
american
daughter
we
have
the
acts
and
utterances
of
such
men
as
archbishop
tait
bishop
temple
dean
stanley
dean
farrar
and
many
others
proving
that
the
deepest
religious
thought
is
more
and
more
tending
to
peace
rather
than
warfare
with
science
and
in
the
other
churches
especially
in
america
while
there
is
yet
much
to
be
desired
the
welcome
extended
in
many
of
them
to
alexander
winchell
and
the
freedom
given
to
views
like
his
augur
well
for
a
better
state
of
things
in
the
future
from
the
science
of
anthropology
when
rightly
viewed
as
a
whole
has
come
the
greatest
aid
to
those
who
work
to
advance
religion
rather
than
to
promote
any
particular
system
of
theology
for
anthropology
and
its
subsidiary
sciences
show
more
and
more
that
man
since
coming
upon
the
earth
has
risen
from
the
period
when
he
had
little
if
any
idea
of
a
great
power
above
him
through
successive
stages
of
fetichism
shamanism
and
idolatry
toward
better
forms
of
belief
making
him
more
and
more
accessible
to
nobler
forms
of
religion
the
same
sciences
show
too
within
the
historic
period
the
same
tendency
and
especially
within
the
events
covered
by
our
sacred
books
a
progress
from
fetichism
of
which
so
many
evidences
crop
out
in
the
early
jewish
worship
as
shown
in
the
old
testament
scriptures
through
polytheism
when
jehovah
was
but
a
god
above
all
gods
through
the
period
when
he
was
a
jealous
god
capricious
and
cruel
until
he
is
revealed
in
such
inspired
utterances
as
those
of
the
nobler
psalms
the
great
passages
in
isaiah
the
sublime
preaching
of
micah
and
above
all
through
the
ideal
given
to
the
world
by
jesus
of
nazareth
well
indeed
has
an
eminent
divine
of
the
church
of
england
in
our
own
time
called
on
christians
to
rejoice
over
this
evolution
between
the
god
of
samuel
who
ordered
infants
to
be
slaughtered
and
the
god
of
the
psalmist
whose
tender
mercies
are
over
all
his
works
between
the
god
of
the
patriarchs
who
was
always
repenting
and
the
god
of
the
apostles
who
is
the
same
yesterday
and
forever
with
whom
there
is
no
variableness
nor
shadow
of
turning
between
the
god
of
the
old
testament
who
walked
in
the
garden
in
the
cool
of
the
day
and
the
god
of
the
new
testament
whom
no
man
hath
seen
nor
can
see
between
the
god
of
leviticus
who
was
so
particular
about
the
sacrificial
furniture
and
utensils
and
the
god
of
the
acts
who
dwelleth
not
in
temples
made
with
hands
between
the
god
who
hardened
pharaoh
heart
and
the
god
who
will
have
all
men
to
be
saved
between
the
god
of
exodus
who
is
merciful
only
to
those
who
love
him
and
the
god
of
christ
the
heavenly
father
who
is
kind
unto
the
unthankful
and
the
evil
however
overwhelming
then
the
facts
may
be
which
anthropology
history
and
their
kindred
sciences
may
in
the
interest
of
simple
truth
establish
against
the
theological
doctrine
of
the
fall
however
completely
they
may
fossilize
various
dogmas

like

further
theological
development
is
seen
in
the
pythagorean
statement
that
lightnings
are
intended
to
terrify
the
damned
in
tartarus
but
at
a
very
early
period
we
see
the
beginning
of
a
scientific
view
in
greece
the
ionic
philosophers
held
that
such
phenomena
are
obedient
to
law
plato
aristotle
and
many
lesser
lights
attempted
to
account
for
them
on
natural
grounds
and
their
explanations
though
crude
were
based
upon
observation
and
thought
in
rome
lucretius
seneca
pliny
and
others
inadequate
as
their
statements
were
implanted
at
least
the
germs
of
a
science
but
as
the
christian
church
rose
to
power
this
evolution
was
checked
the
new
leaders
of
thought
found
in
the
scriptures
recognized
by
them
as
sacred
the
basis
for
a
new
view
or
rather
for
a
modification
of
the
old
view
this
ending
of
a
scientific
evolution
based
upon
observation
and
reason
and
this
beginning
of
a
sacred
science
based
upon
the
letter
of
scripture
and
on
theology
are
seen
in
the
utterances
of
various
fathers
in
the
early
church
as
to
the
general
features
of
this
new
development
tertullian
held
that
sundry
passages
of
scripture
prove
lightning
identical
with
and
this
idea
was
transmitted
from
generation
to
generation
of
later
churchmen
who
found
an
especial
support
of
tertullian
view
in
the
sulphurous
smell
experienced
during
thunderstorms
hilary
thought
the
firmament
very
much
lower
than
the
heavens
and
that
it
was
created
not
only
for
the
support
of
the
upper
waters
but
also
for
the
tempering
of
our
atmosphere
ambrose
held
that
thunder
is
caused
by
the
winds
breaking
through
the
solid
firmament
and
cited
from
the
prophet
amos
the
sublime
passage
regarding
him
that
establisheth
the
thunders
he
shows
indeed
some
conception
of
the
true
source
of
rain
but
his
whole
reasoning
is
limited
by
various
scriptural
texts
he
lays
great
stress
upon
the
firmament
as
a
solid
outer
shell
of
the
universe
the
heavens
he
holds
to
be
not
far
outside
this
outer
shell
and
argues
regarding
their
character
from
paul
epistle
to
the
corinthians
and
from
the
one
hundred
and
psalm
as
to
the
waters
which
are
above
the
firmament
he
takes
up
the
objection
of
those
who
hold
that
this
outside
of
the
universe
being
spherical
the
waters
must
slide
off
it
especially
if
the
firmament
revolves
and
he
points
out
that
it
is
by
no
means
certain
that
the
outside
of
the
firmament
is
spherical
and
insists
that
if
it
does
revolve
the
water
is
just
what
is
needed

lubricate

cool
its

the
germinal
principle
in
accordance
with
which
all
these
theories
were
evolved
was
most
clearly
proclaimed
to
the
world
by
augustine
in
his
famous
utterance
nothing
is
to
be
accepted
save
on
the
authority
of
scripture
since
greater
is
that
authority
than
all

powers

breathe

unfortunately
what
was

understood

authority
of

was
the
tyranny
of
sacred
books
imperfectly
transcribed

following
this
precept
of
augustine
there
were
developed
in
every
field
theological
views
of
science
which
have
never
led
to
a
single
truth
which
without
exception
have
forced
mankind
away
from
the
truth
and
have
caused
christendom
to
stumble
for
centuries
into
abysses
of
error
and
sorrow
in
meteorology
as
in
every
other
science
with
which
he
dealt
augustine
based
everything
upon
the
letter
of
the
sacred
text
and
it
is
characteristic
of
the
result
that
this
man
so
great
when
untrammelled
thought
it
his
duty
to
guard
especially
the
whole
theory
of
the
waters
above
the
heavens
in
the
sixth
century
this
theological
reasoning
was
still
further
developed
as
we
have
seen
by
cosmas
indicopleustes
finding
a
sanction
for
the
old
egyptian
theory
of
the
universe
in
the
ninth
chapter
of
hebrews
he
insisted
that
the
earth
is
a
flat
parallelogram
and
that
from
its
outer
edges
rise
immense
walls
supporting
the
firmament
then
throwing
together
the
reference
to
the
firmament
in
genesis
and
the
outburst
of
poetry
in
the
psalms
regarding
the
waters
that
be
above
the
heavens
he
insisted
that
over
the
terrestrial
universe
are
solid
arches
bearing
a
vault
supporting
a
vast
cistern
containing
the
waters
finally
taking
from
genesis
the
expression
regarding
the
windows
of
heaven
he
insisted
that
these
windows
are
opened
and
closed
by
the
angels
whenever
the
almighty
wishes
to
send
rain
upon
the
earth
or
to
withhold
it
this
was
accepted
by
the
universal
church
as
a
vast
contribution
to
thought
for
several
centuries
it
was
the
orthodox
doctrine
and
various
leaders
in
theology
devoted
themselves
to
developing
and
supplementing
it
about
the
beginning
of
the
seventh
century
isidore
bishop
of
seville
was
the
ablest
prelate
in
christendom
and
was
showing
those
great
qualities
which
led
to
his
enrolment
among
the
saints
of
the
church
his
theological
view
of
science
marks
an
epoch
as
to
the
waters
above
the
firmament
isidore
contends
that
they
must
be
lower
than
the
uppermost
heaven
though
higher
than
the
lower
heaven
because
in
the
one
hundred
and
psalm
they
are
mentioned
after
the
heavenly
bodies
and
the
heaven
of
heavens
but
before
the
terrestrial
elements
as
to
their
purpose
he
hesitates
between
those
who
held
that
they
were
stored
up
there
by
the
prescience
of
god
for
the
destruction
of
the
world
at
the
flood
as
the
words
of
scripture
that
the
windows
of
heaven
were
opened
seemed
to
indicate
and
those
who
held
that
they
were
kept
there
to
moderate
the
heat
of
the
heavenly
bodies
as
to
the
firmament
he
is
in
doubt
whether
it
envelops
the
earth
like
an
eggshell
or
is
merely
spread
over
it
like
a
curtain
for
he
holds
that
the
passage
in
the
one
hundred
and
fourth
psalm
may
be
used
to
support
either
view
having
laid
these
scriptural
foundations
isidore
shows
considerable
power
of
thought
indeed
at
times
when
he
discusses
the
rainbow
rain
hail
snow
and
frost
his
theories
are
rational
and
give
evidence
that
if
he
could
have
broken
away
from
his
adhesion
to
the
letter
of
scripture
he
might
have
given
a
strong
impulse
to
the
evolution
of
a
true
science

cosmas

the
venerable
the
nucleus
of
his
theory
also
is
to
be
found
in
the
accepted
view
of
the
firmament
and
of
the
waters
above
the
heavens
derived
from
genesis
the
firmament
he
holds
to
be
spherical
and
of
a
nature

the

he
says
which
contain
the

god
has

with

they

elements
as
to
the
waters
placed
above
the
firmament
lower
than
the
spiritual
heavens
but
higher
than
all
corporeal
creatures
he
says
some
declare
that
they
were
stored
there
for
the
deluge
but
others
more
correctly
that
they
are
intended
to
temper
the
fire
of
the
stars
he
goes
on
with
long
discussions
as
to
various
elements
and
forces
in
nature
and
dwells
at
length
upon
the
air
of
which
he
says
that
the
upper
serene
air
is
over
the
heavens
while
the
lower
which
is
coarse
with
humid
exhalations
is
sent
off
from
the
earth
and
that
in
this
are
lightning
hail
snow
ice
and
tempests
finding
proof
of
this
in
the
one
hundred
and

where
these
are
commanded
to
praise
the

so
great
was
bede
authority
that
nearly
all
the
anonymous
speculations
of
the
next
following
centuries
upon
these
subjects
were
eventually
ascribed
to
him
in
one
of
these
spurious
treatises
an
attempt
is
made
to
get
new
light
upon
the
sources
of
the
waters
above
the
heavens
the
main
reliance
being
the
sheet
containing
the
animals
let
down
from
heaven
in
the
vision
of
peter
another
of
these
treatises
is
still
more
curious
for
it
endeavours
to
account
for
earthquakes
and
tides
by
means
of
the
leviathan
mentioned
in
scripture
this
characteristic
passage
runs
as
follows
some
say
that
the
earth
contains
the
animal
leviathan
and
that
he
holds
his
tail
after
a
fashion
of
his
own
so
that
it
is
sometimes
scorched
by
the
sun
whereupon
he
strives
to
get
hold
of
the
sun
and
so
the
earth
is
shaken
by
the
motion
of
his
indignation
he
drinks
in
also
at
times
such
huge
masses
of
the
waves
that
when
he
belches
them
forth
all
the
seas
feel
their
effect
and
this
theological
theory
of
the
tides
as
caused
by
the
alternate
suction
and
belching
of
leviathan
went
far
and
wide
see
the
treatise
de
mundi
constitutione
in
bede
opera

in
the
writings
thus
covered
with
the
name
of

there
is
much
showing
a
scientific
spirit
which
might
have
come
to
something
of
permanent
value
had
it
not
been
hampered
by
the
supposed
necessity
of
conforming
to
the
letter

it
is
as
startling
as
it
is
refreshing
to
hear
one
of
these
medieval
theorists
burst
out
as
follows
against
those
who
are
content
to
explain
everything
by
the
power
of
god
what
is
more
pitiable
than
to
say
that
a
thing
is
because
god
is
able
to
do
it
and
not
to
show
any
reason
why
it
is
so
nor
any
purpose
for
which
it
is
so
just
as
if
god
did
everything
that
he
is
able
to
do
you
talk
like
one
who
says
that
god
is
able
to
make
a
calf
out
of
a
log
but
did
he
ever
do
it
either
then
show
a
reason
why
a
thing
is
so
or
a
purpose
wherefore
it
is
so
or
else
cease
to
declare
it
so
for
this
remonstrance
see

which
has
also
been
printed
under
the
title
of

is
believed
by
modern
scholars
haureau

to
be
the
production
of
william
of
conches
the
most
permanent
contribution
of
bede
to
scientific
thought
in
this
field
was
his
revival
of
the
view
that
the
firmament
is
made
of
ice
and
he
supported
this
from
the
words
in
the
chapter
of
job
he
bindeth
up
the
waters
in
his
thick
cloud
and
the
cloud
is
not
rent
under
them
about
the
beginning
of
the
ninth
century
appeared
the
third
in
that
triumvirate
of
churchmen
who
were
the
oracles
of
sacred
science
throughout
the
early
middle
ages
rabanus
maurus
abbot
of
fulda
and
archbishop
of
mayence
starting
like
all
his
predecessors
from
the
first
chapter
of
genesis
borrowing
here
and
there
from
the
ancient
philosophers
and
excluding
everything
that
could
conflict
with
the
letter
of
scripture
he
follows
in
his
work
upon
the
universe
his
two
predecessors
isidore
and
bede
developing
especially
theory
drawn
from
ezekiel
that
the
firmament
is
strong
enough
to
hold
up
the
waters
above
the
heavens
because
it
is
made
of
ice
for
centuries
the
authority
of
these
three
great
teachers
was
unquestioned
and
in
countless
manuals
and
catechisms
their
doctrine
was
translated
and
diluted
for
the
common
mind
but
about
the
second
quarter
of
the
twelfth
century
a
priest
honorius
of
autun
produced
several
treatises
which
show
that
thought
on
this
subject
had
made
some
little
progress
he
explained
the
rain
rationally
and
mainly
in
the
modern
manner
with
the
thunder
he
is
less
successful
but
insists
that
the
thunderbolt
is
not
stone
as
some
assert
his
thinking
is
vigorous
and
independent
had
theorists
such
as
he
been
many
a
new
science
could
have
been
rapidly
evolved
but
the
theological
current
was
too
strong
for
rabanus
maurus
see
the
comment
in
genesim
and
de
universo
migne
patr
vol
cvii
cxi
for
a
charmingly
naive
example
of
the
primers
referred
to
see
the
little
manual
of
astronomy
sometimes
attributed
to
aelfric
it
is
in
the
vernacular
but
is
translated
in
wright
popular
treatises
on
science
during
the
middle
ages
bede
is
of
course
its
chief
source
for
honorius
see
de
imagine
mundi
and
hexaemeron
migne
patr
vol
clxxii
the
de
philosophia
mundi
the
most
rational
of
all
is
however
believed
by
modern
scholars
to
be
unjustly
ascribed
to
him
see
note
above
the
strength
of
this
current
which
overwhelmed
the
thought
of
honorius
is
seen
again
in
the
work
of
the
dominican
monk
john
of
san
geminiano
who
in
the
thirteenth
century
gave
forth
his
summa
de
exemplis
for
the
use
of
preachers
in
his
order
of
its
thousand
pages
over
two
hundred
are
devoted
to
illustrations
drawn
from
the
heavens
and
the
elements
a
characteristic
specimen
is
his
explanation
of
the
psalmist
phrase
the
arrows
of
the
thunder
these
he
tells
us
are
forged
out
of
a
dry
vapour
rising
from
the
earth
and
kindled
by
the
heat
of
the
upper
air
which
then
coming
into
contact
with
a
cloud
just
turning
into
rain
is
conglutinated
like
flour
into
dough
but
being
too
hot
to
be
extinguished
its
particles
become
merely
sharpened
at
the
lower
end
and
so
blazing
arrows
cleaving
and
burning
everything
they
touch
see
joannes
a
geminiano
summa
but
far
more
important
in
the
thirteenth
century
was
the
fact
that
the
most
eminent
scientific
authority
of
that
age
albert
the
great
bishop
of
ratisbon
attempted
to
reconcile
the
speculations
of
aristotle
with
theological
views
derived
from
the
fathers
in
one
very
important
respect
he
improved
upon
the
meteorological
views
of
his
great
master
the
thunderbolt
he
says
is
no
mere
fire
but
the
product
of
black
clouds
containing
much
mud
which
when
it
is
baked
by
the
intense
heat
forms
a
fiery
black
or
red
stone
that
falls
from
the
sky
tearing
beams
and
crushing
walls
in
its
course
such
he
has
seen
with
his
own
eyes
see
albertus
magnus
ii
vol
xv
a
cited
by
heller
gesch
physik
vol
i
and
his
liber
methaurorum
iii
iv
of
which
i
have
used
the
edition
of
venice
the
monkish
encyclopedists
of
the
later
middle
ages
added
little
to
these
theories
as
we
glance
over
the
pages
of
vincent
of
beauvais
the
monk
bartholomew
and
william
of
conches
we
note
only
a
growing
deference
to
the
authority
of
aristotle
as
supplementing
that
of
isidore
and
bede
and
explaining
sacred
scripture
aristotle
is
treated
like
a
church
father
but
extreme
care
is
taken
not
to
go
beyond
the
great
maxim
of
augustine
then
little
by
little
bede
and
isidore
fall
into
the
background
aristotle
fills
the
whole
horizon
and
his
utterances
are
second
in
sacredness
only
to
the
text
of
holy
writ
a
curious
illustration
of
the
difficulties
these
medieval
scholars
had
to
meet
in
reconciling
the
scientific
theories
of
aristotle
with
the
letter
of
the
bible
is
seen
in
the
case
of
the
rainbow
it
is
to
the
honour
of
aristotle
that
his
conclusions
regarding
the
rainbow
though
slightly
erroneous
were
based
upon
careful
observation
and
evolved
by
reasoning
alone
but
his
christian
commentators
while
anxious
to
follow
him
had
to
bear
in
mind
the
scriptural
statement
that
god
had
created
the
rainbow
as
a
sign
to
noah
that
there
should
never
again
be
a
flood
on
the
earth
even
so
bold
a
thinker
as
cardinal
whose
speculations
as
to
the
geography
of
the
earth
did
so
much
afterward
in
stimulating
columbus
faltered
before
this
statement
acknowledging
that
god
alone
could
explain
it
but
suggested
that
possibly
never
before
the
deluge
had
a
cloud
been
suffered
to
take
such
a
position
toward
the
sun
as
to
cause
a
rainbow
the
learned
cardinal
was
also
constrained
to
believe
that
certain
stars
and
constellations
have
something
to
do
in
causing
the
rain
since
these
would
best
explain
noah
foreknowledge
of
the
deluge
in
connection
with
this
scriptural
doctrine
of
winds
came
a
scriptural
doctrine
of
earthquakes
they
were
believed
to
be
caused
by
winds
issuing
from
the
earth
and
this
view
was
based
upon
the
passage
in
the
one
hundred
and
psalm
he
bringeth
the
wind
out
of
his
treasuries
for
see
his

such
were
the
main
typical
attempts
during
nearly
fourteen
centuries
to
build
up
under
theological
guidance
and
within
scriptural
limitations
a
sacred
science
of
meteorology
but
these
theories
were
mainly
evolved
in
the
effort
to
establish
a
basis
and
general
theory
of
phenomena
it
still
remained
to
account
for
special
manifestations
and
here
came
a
twofold
development
of
theological
thought
on
one
hand
these
phenomena
were
attributed
to
the
almighty
and
on
the
other
to
satan
as
to
the
first
of
these
theories
we
constantly
find
the
divine
wrath
mentioned
by
the
earlier
fathers
as
the
cause
of
lightning
hailstorms
hurricanes
and
the
like
in
the
early
days
of
christianity
we
see
a
curious
struggle
between
pagan
and
christian
belief
upon
this
point
near
the
close
of
the
second
century
the
emperor
marcus
aurelius
in
his
effort
to
save
the
empire
fought
a
hotly
contested
battle
with
the
quadi
in
what
is
now
hungary
while
the
issue
of
this
great
battle
was
yet
doubtful
there
came
suddenly
a
blinding
storm
beating
into
the
faces
of
the
quadi
and
this
gave
the
roman
troops
the
advantage
enabling
marcus
aurelius
to
win
a
decisive
victory
votaries
of
each
of
the
great
religions
claimed
that
this
storm
was
caused
by
the
object
of
their
own
adoration
the
pagans
insisted
that
jupiter
had
sent
the
storm
in
obedience
to
their
prayers
and
on
the
antonine
column
at
rome
we
may
still
see
the
figure
of
olympian
jove
casting
his
thunderbolts
and
pouring
a
storm
of
rain
from
the
open
heavens
against
the
quadi
on
the
other
hand
the
christians
insisted
that
the
storm
had
been
sent
by
jehovah
in
obedience
to
their
prayers
and
tertullian
eusebius
gregory
of
nyssa
and
jerome
were
among
those
who
insisted
upon
this
meteorological
miracle
the
first
two
indeed
in
the
fervour
of
their
arguments
for
its
reality
allowing
themselves
to
be
carried
considerably
beyond
exact
historical
truth
for
the
authorities
pagan
and
christian
see

note
of

the
fathers
developed
this
view
more
and
more
from
various
texts
in
the
jewish
and
christian
sacred
books
substituting
for
jupiter
flinging
his
thunderbolts
the
almighty
wrapped
in
thunder
and
sending
forth
his
lightnings
through
the
middle
ages
this
was
fostered
until
it
came
to
be
accepted
as
a
mere
truism
entering
into
all
medieval
thinking
and
was
still
further
developed
by
an
attempt
to
specify
the
particular
sins
which
were
thus
punished
thus
even
the
rational
florentine
historian
villani
ascribed
floods
and
fires
to
the
too
great
pride
of
the
city
of
florence
and
the
ingratitude
of
the
citizens
toward
god
which
of
course
says
a
recent
historian
meant
their
insufficient
attention

the
ceremonies

in
the
thirteenth
century
the
cistercian
monk
caesarius
of
heisterbach
popularized
the
doctrine
in
central
europe
his
rich
collection
of
anecdotes
for
the
illustration
of
religious
truths
was
the
favourite
recreative
reading
in
the
convents
for
three
centuries
and
exercised
great
influence
over
the
thought
of
the
later
middle
ages
in
this
work
he
relates
several
instances
of
the
divine
use
of
lightning
both
for
rescue
and
for
punishment
thus
he
tells
us
how
the
steward
cellerarius
of
his
own
monastery
was
saved
from
the
clutch
of
a
robber
by
a
clap
of
thunder
which
in
answer
to
his
prayer
burst
suddenly
from
the
sky
and
frightened
the
bandit
from
his
purpose
how
in
a
saxon
theatre
twenty
men
were
struck
down
while
a
priest
escaped
not
because
he
was
not
a
greater
sinner
than
the
rest
but
because
the
thunderbolt
had
respect
for
his
profession
it
is
cesarius
too
who
tells
us
the
story
of
the
priest
of
treves
struck
by
lightning
in
his
own
church
whither
he
had
gone
to
ring
the
bell
against
the
storm
and
whose
sins
were
revealed
by
the
course
of
the
lightning
for
it
tore
his
clothes
from
him
and
consumed
certain
parts
of
his
body
showing
that
the
sins
for
which
he
was
punished
were
vanity

unchastity

this
mode
of
explaining
the
divine
interference
more
minutely
is
developed
century
after
century
and
we
find
both
catholics

protestants
assigning
as
causes
of
unpleasant
meteorological
phenomena
whatever
appears
to
them
wicked

early
in
the
seventeenth
century
majoli
bishop
of
voltoraria
in
southern
italy
produced
his
huge
work
dies
canicularii
or
dog
days
which
remained
a
favourite
encyclopedia
in
catholic
lands
for
over
a
hundred
years
treating
of
thunder
and
lightning
he
compares
them
to
bombs
against
the
wicked
and
says
that
the
thunderbolt
is
an
exhalation
condensed
and
cooked
into
stone
and
that
it
is
not
to
be
doubted
that
of
all
instruments
of
god
vengeance
the
thunderbolt
is
the
chief
that
by
means
of
it
sennacherib
and
his
army
were
consumed
that
luther
was
struck
by
lightning
in
his
youth
as
a
caution
against
departing
from
the
catholic
faith
that
blasphemy
and
are
the
sins
to
which
this
punishment
is
especially
assigned
and
he
cites
the
case
of
dathan
and
abiram
fifty
years
later
the
jesuit
stengel
developed
this
line
of
thought
still
further
in
four
thick
quarto
volumes
on
the
judgments
of
god
adding
an
elaborate
schedule
for
the
use
of
preachers
in
the
sermons
of
an
entire
year
three
chapters
were
devoted
to
thunder
lightning
and
storms
that
the
author
teaches
the
agency
in
these
of
diabolical
powers
goes
without
saying
but
this
can
only
act
he
declares
by
divine
permission
and
the
thunderbolt
is
always
the
finger
of
god
which
rarely
strikes
a
man
save
for
his
sins
and
the
nature
of
the
special
sin
thus
punished
may
be
inferred
from
the
bodily
organs
smitten
a
few
years
later
in
protestant
swabia
pastor
georg
nuber
issued
a
volume
of
in
which
he
discusses
nearly
every
sort
of
elemental
disturbances
storms
floods
droughts
lightning
and
hail
these
he
says
come
direct
from
god
for
human
sins
yet
no
doubt
with
discrimination
for
there
are
five
sins
which
god
especially
punishes
with
lightning
and
hail
namely
impenitence
incredulity
neglect
of
the
repair
of
churches
fraud
in
the
payment
of
tithes
to
the
clergy
and
oppression
of
subordinates

of
which
points

adaptability

meteorological
emergencies
the
preface
of
this
volume
is
contributed
by
dilherr
pastor
of
the
great
church
of
sebald
at
nuremberg
who
in
discussing
the
divine
purposes
of
storms
adds
to
the
three
usually
assigned
namely
wish
to
manifest
his
power
to
display
his
anger
and
to
drive
sinners
to
repentance
a
fourth
which
he
says
is
that
god
may
show
us
with
what
sort
of
a
stormbell
he
will
one
day
ring
in
the
last
judgment
about
the
end
of
the
first
quarter
of
the
eighteenth
century

find
in

even
the
eminent
and
rational
professor
of
mathematics
scheuchzer
publishing
his
physica
sacra
with
the
bible
as
a
basis
and
forced
to
admit
that
the
elements
in
the
most
literal
sense
utter
the
voice
of
god

pressure
was
felt
in

voice
of
god
speaking

out
of

word
he
declares
when
there
are
great
tempests
the
angels
oftentimes
have
a
hand
therein
yea
and
sometimes
evil
angels
he
gives
several
cases
of
blasphemers
struck
by
lightning
and
says
nothing
can
be
more
dangerous
for
mortals
than
to
contemn
dreadful
providences
and
in
particular
dreadful
tempests

distinguished
son

himself
somewhat
from
the

view
as
he

his
thoughts
for

day
of

and
his
sermon
preached
at

tending

this
theory
which
attributed
injurious
meteorological
phenomena
mainly
to
the
purposes
of
god
was
a
natural
development
and
comparatively
harmless
but
at
a
very
early
period
there
was
evolved
another
theory
which
having
been
ripened
into
a
doctrine
cost
the
earth
dear
indeed
never
perhaps
in
the
modern
world
has
there
been
a
dogma
more
prolific
of
physical
mental
and
moral
agony
throughout
whole
nations
and
during
whole
centuries

theory

development

fearful

its
destruction

while
the
fathers
and

were
labouring

from

books
there
oozed
up
in

society
a
mass
of
traditions
and
observances
which
had
been
lurking
since
the
days
of
paganism
and
although
here
and
there
appeared
a
churchman
to
oppose
them
the
theologians
and
ecclesiastics
ere
long
began
to
adopt
them
and
to
clothe
them
with
the
authority
of
religion
both
among
the
pagans
of
the
roman
empire
and
among
the
barbarians
of
the
north
the
christian
missionaries
had
found
it
easier
to
prove
the
new
god
supreme
than
to
prove
the
old
gods
powerless
faith
in
the
miracles
of
the
new
religion
seemed
to
increase
rather
than
to
diminish
faith
in
the
miracles
of
the
old
and
the
church
at
last
began
admitting
the
latter
as
facts
but
ascribing
them
to
the
devil
jupiter
and
odin
sank
into
the
category
of
ministers
of
satan
and
transferred
to
that
master
all
their
former
powers
a
renewed
study
of
scripture
by
theologians
elicited
overwhelming
proofs
of
the
truth
of
this
doctrine
stress
was
especially
laid
on
the
declaration
of
scripture
the
gods
of
the
heathen
are
devils
supported
by
this
and
other
texts
it
soon
became
a
dogma
so
strong
was
the
hold
it
took
under
the
influence
of
the
church
that
not
until
late
in
the
seventeenth
century
did
its
substantial
truth
begin
to
be
questioned
for
so
the
vulgate
and
all
the
early
versions
rendered
ps
xcvi
with
no
field
of
action
had
the
sway
of
the
ancient
deities
been
more
identified
than
with
that
of
atmospheric
phenomena
the
roman
heard
jupiter
and
the
teuton
heard
thor
in
the
thunder
could
it
be
doubted
that
these
powerful
beings
would
now
take
occasion
unless
hindered
by
the
command
of
the
almighty
to
vent
their
spite
against
those
who
had
deserted
their
altars
might
not
the
almighty
himself
be
willing
to
employ
the
malice
of
these
powers
of
the
air
against
those
who
had
offended
him
it
was
indeed
no
great
step
for
those
whose
simple
faith
accepted
rain
or
sunshine
as
an
answer
to
their
prayers
to
suspect
that
the
untimely
storms
or
droughts
which
baffled
their
most
earnest
petitions
were
the
work
of
the
archenemy
the
prince
of
the
power
of
the
air
the
great
fathers
of
the
church
had
easily
found
warrant
for
this
doctrine
in
scripture
jerome
declared
the
air
to
be
full
of
devils
basing
this
belief
upon
various
statements
in
the
prophecies
of
isaiah
and
in
the
epistle

the

reisch
margarita
or
eck
aristotle
these
peculiar
phenomena
made
much
of
by
the
allegorizing
sermonizers
of
the
day
were
used
in
moral
lessons
from
every
pulpit
thus
the
carmelite
matthias
farinator
of

at
the
pope
own
instance
compiled
early
in
the
fifteenth
century
that

this
doctrine
grew
robust
and
noxious
until
in
the
fifteenth
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
we
find
its
bloom
in
a
multitude
of
treatises
by
the
most
learned
of
the
catholic
and
protestant
divines
and
its
fruitage
in
the
torture
chambers
and
on
the
scaffolds
throughout
christendom
at
the
reformation
period
and
for
nearly
two
hundred
years
afterward
catholics
and
protestants
vied
with
each
other
in
promoting
this
growth
john
eck
the
great
opponent
of
luther
gave
to
the
world
an
annotated
edition
of
aristotle
physics
which
was
long
authoritative
in
the
german
universities
and
though
the
text
is
free
from
this
doctrine
the
woodcut
illustrating
the
earth
atmosphere
shows
most
vividly
among
the
clouds
of
the
devils
who
there
reign
supreme
see
eck
aristotelis

augsburg
luther
in
the
other
religious
camp
supported
the
superstition
even
more
zealously
asserting
at
times
his
belief
that
the
winds
themselves
are
only
good
or
evil
spirits
and
declaring
that
a
stone
thrown
into
a
certain
pond
in
his
native
region
would
cause
a
dreadful
storm
because
of
the
devils
kept
prisoners

for

translated
by

just
at
the
close
of
the
same
century
catholics
and
protestants
welcomed
alike
the
great
work
of
delrio
in
this
the
power
of
devils
over
the
elements
is
proved
first
from
the
holy
scriptures
since
he
declares
they
show
that
satan
brought
fire
down
from
heaven
to
consume
the
servants
and
flocks
of
job
and
that
he
stirred
up
a
violent
wind
which
overwhelmed
in
ruin
the
sons
and
daughters
of
job
at
their
feasting
next
delrio
insists
on
the
agreement
of
all
the
orthodox
fathers
that
it
was
the
devil
himself
who
did
this
and
attention
is
called
to
the
fact
that
the
hail
with
which
the
egyptians
were
punished
is
expressly
declared
in
holy
scripture
to
have
been
brought
by
the
evil
angels
citing
from
the
apocalypse
he
points
to
the
four
angels
standing
at
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
holding
back
the
winds
and
preventing
their
doing
great
damage
to
mortals
and
he
dwells
especially
upon
the
fact
that
the
devil
is
called
by
the
apostle
a
prince
of
the
power
of
the
air
he
then
goes
on
to
cite
the
great
fathers
of
the
church
clement
jerome
augustine
and
thomas
aquinas
for
delrio
see
his
disquisitiones
magicae
first
printed
at
liege
in
but
reprinted
again
and
again
throughout
the
seventeenth
century
his
interpretation
of
psalm
lxxviii
was
apparently
shared
by
the
translators
of
our
own
authorized
edition
for
citations
by
him
see

vii
ephesians
ii
even
according
to
modern
commentators
alford
the
word
here
translated
power
denotes
not
might
but
government
court
hierarchy
and
in
this
sense
it
was
always
used
by
the
ecclesiastical
writers
whose
conception
is
best
rendered
by
our
plural
powers
see
delrio
disquisitiones
magicae
lib

this
doctrine
was
spread
not
only
in
ponderous
treatises
but
in
light
literature
and
by
popular
illustrations
in
the
compendium
maleficarum
of
the
italian
monk
guacci
perhaps
the
most
amusing
book
in
the
whole
literature
of
witchcraft
we
may
see
the
witch
in
propria
persona
riding
the
diabolic
goat
through
the
clouds
while
the
storm
rages
around
and
beneath
her
and
we
may
read
a
rich
collection
of
anecdotes
largely
contemporary
which
establish
the
required
doctrine
beyond
question
the
first
and
most
natural
means
taken
against
this
work
of
satan
in
the
air
was
prayer
and
various
petitions
are
to
be
found
scattered
through
the
christian
liturgies
some
very
beautiful
and
touching
this
means
of
escape
has
been
relied
upon
with
greater
or
less
faith
from
those
days
to
these
various
medieval
saints
and
reformers
and
devoted
men
in
all
centuries
from
giles
to
john
wesley
have
used
it
with
results
claimed
to
be
miraculous
whatever
theory
any
thinking
man
may
hold
in
the
matter
he
will
certainly
not
venture
a
reproachful
word
such
prayers
have
been
in
all
ages
a
natural
outcome
of
the
mind
of
man
in
trouble
for
guacci
see
his
compendium
maleficarum
milan
for
the
cases
of
giles
john
wesley
and
others
stilling
the
tempests
see
brewer
dictionary
of
miracles
prayer
but
against
the
power
of
the
air
were
used
other
means
of
a
very
different
character
and
tendency
and
foremost
among
these
was
exorcism
in
an
exorcism
widely
used
and
ascribed
to
pope
gregory
xiii
the
formula
is
given
i
a
priest
of
christ
do
command
ye
most
foul
spirits
who
do
stir
up
these
clouds
that
ye
depart
from
them
and
disperse
yourselves
into
wild
and
untilled
places
that
ye
may
be
no
longer
able
to
harm
men
or
animals
or
fruits
or
herbs
or
whatsoever
is
designed
for
human
use
but
this
is
mild
indeed
compared
to
some
later
exorcisms
as
when
the
ritual
runs
all
the
people
shall
rise
and
the
priest
turning
toward
the
clouds
shall
pronounce
these
words
exorcise
ye
accursed
demons
who
have
dared
to
use
for
the
accomplishment
of
your
iniquity
those
powers
of
nature
by
which
god
in
divers
ways
worketh
good
to
mortals
who
stir
up
winds
gather
vapours
form
clouds
and
condense
them
into
hail
i
exorcise
ye
that
ye
relinquish
the
work
ye
have
begun
dissolve
the
hail
scatter
the
clouds
disperse
the
vapours
and
restrain
the
winds
the
rubric
goes
on
to
order
that
then
there
shall
be
a
great
fire
kindled
in
an
open
place
and
that
over
it
the
sign
of
the
cross
shall
be
made
and
the
one
hundred
and
fourteenth
psalm
chanted
while
malodorous
substances
among
them
sulphur
and
asafoetida
shall
be
cast
into
the
flames
the
purpose
seems
to
have
been
literally
to
smoke
out

devotes
a
chapter
to
this
subject

conclusive

nor
was
this
theory
of
exorcism
by
any
means
confined
to
the
elder
church
luther
vehemently
upheld
it
and
prescribed
especially
the
first
chapter
of
john
gospel
as
of
unfailing
efficacy
against
thunder
and
lightning
declaring
that
he
had
often
found
the
mere
sign
of
the
cross
with
the
text
the
word
was
made
flesh
sufficient
to
put
storms
to
flight
so
at
least
says
gretser
in
his
de
ben
et
as
above
from
the
beginning
of
the
middle
ages
until
long
after
the
reformation
the
chronicles
give
ample
illustration
of
the
successful
use
of
such
exorcisms
so
strong
was
the
belief
in
them
that
it
forced
itself
into
minds
comparatively
rational
and
found
utterance
in
treatises
of
much
importance
but
since
exorcisms
were
found
at
times
ineffectual
other
means
were
sought
and
especially
fetiches
of
various
sorts
one
of
the
earliest
of
these
appeared
when
pope
alexander
i
according
to
tradition
ordained
that
holy
water
should
be
kept
in
churches
and
bedchambers
to
drive
away
devils
another
safeguard
was
found
in
relics
and
of
similar
efficacy
were
the
conception
billets
sold
by
the
carmelite
monks
they
contained
a
formula
upon
consecrated
paper
at
which
the
devil
might
well
turn
pale
buried
in
the
corner
of
a
field
one
of
these
was
thought
to
give
protection
against
bad
weather
and
destructive
insects

the

but
highest
in
repute
during
centuries
was
the
agnus

a
piece
of
wax
blessed
by
the
pope
own
hand
and
stamped
with
the
device
representing
the
lamb
of
god
its
powers
were
so
marvellous
that

three
of

the
greek
emperor

their
virtues
their
meteorological
efficacy
stands
first
for
especial
stress
is
laid
on
their
power
of
dispelling
the
thunder
the
stress
thus
laid
by
pope
urban
as
the
infallible
guide
of
christendom
on
the
efficacy
of
this
fetich
gave
it
great
value
throughout
europe
and
the
doggerel
verses
reciting
its
virtues
sank
deep
into
the
popular
mind
it
was
considered
a
most
potent
means
of
dispelling
hail
pestilence
storms
conflagrations
and
enchantments
and
this
feeling
was
deepened
by
the
rules
and
rites
for
its
consecration
so
solemn
was
the
matter
that
the
manufacture
and
sale
of
this
particular
fetich
was
by
a
papal
bull
of
reserved
for
the
pope
himself
and
he
only
performed
the
required
ceremony
in
the
first
and
seventh
years
of
his
pontificate
standing
unmitred
he
prayed
o
god
we
humbly
beseech
thee
that
thou
wilt
bless
these
waxen
forms
figured
with
the
image
of
an
innocent
lamb
that
at
the
touch
and
sight
of
them
the
faithful
may
break
forth
into
praises
and
that
the
crash
of
hailstorms
the
blast
of
hurricanes
the
violence
of
tempests
the
fury
of
winds
and
the
malice
of
thunderbolts
may
be
tempered
and
evil
spirits
flee
and
tremble
before
the
standard
of
thy
holy
cross
which
is
graven
upon
them
these
pious
charms
are
still
in
use
in
the
church
and
may
be
found

in

was
a

for

most
temporal
ills
during

let

consult

passim
another
favourite
means
with
the
clergy
of
the
older
church
for
bringing
to
naught
the
power
of
the
air
was
found
in
great
processions
bearing
statues
relics
and
holy
emblems
through
the
streets
yet
even
these
were
not
always
immediately
effective
one
at
liege
in
the
thirteenth
century
thrice
proved
unsuccessful
in
bringing
rain
when
at
last
it
was
found
that
the
image
of
the
virgin
had
been
forgotten
a
new
procession
was
at
once
formed
the
salve
regina
sung
and
the
rain
came
down
in
such
torrents
as
to
drive
the
devotees
to
shelter
john
of
winterthur
describes
many
such
processions
in
switzerland
in
the
thirteenth
century
and
all
the
monkish
chronicles
speak
of
them
see
also
rydberg
magic
of
the
middle
ages
in
catholic
lands
this
custom
remains
to
this
day
and
very
important
features
in
these
processions
are
the
statues
and
the
reliquaries
of
patron
saints
some
of
these
excel
in
bringing
sunshine
others
in
bringing
rain
the
cathedral
of

so
fortunate
as
to
possess
sundry
relics
of
taurin
especially
potent
against
dry
weather
and
some
of
piat
very
nearly
as
infallible
against
wet
weather
in
certain
regions
a
single
saint
gives
protection
alternately
against
wet
and
dry
weather
as
for
example
godeberte

against

barbara
is
very
generally
considered
the
most
powerful
protectress
but
in
the
french
diocese
of
limoges
notre
dame
de

has
proved
a
most
powerful
rival
for
when
a
few
years
since
all
the
neighbouring

were
ravaged
by
storms

a
hailstone
fell

especially
invoked

cited
by
paul
parfait
in
his

des

pp
of
the
dossier
but
the
means
of
baffling
the
powers
of
the
air
which
came
to
be
most
widely
used
was
the
ringing
of
consecrated
church
bells
this
usage
had
begun
in
the
time
of
charlemagne
and
there
is
extant
a
prohibition
of
his
against
the
custom
of
baptizing
bells
and
of
hanging
certain
tags
on
their
tongues
as
a
protection
against
hailstorms
but
even
charlemagne
was
powerless
against
this
current
of
medieval
superstition
theological
reasons
were
soon
poured
into
it
and
in
the
year
pope
john
xiii
gave
it
the
highest
ecclesiastical
sanction
by
himself
baptizing
the
great
bell
of
his
cathedral
church
the
lateran
and
christening
it
with
his

the
conjecture
of
baronius
that
the
bell
was
named
after
john
the
baptist
is
even
more
startling
than
the
accepted
tradition
of
the
pope
sponsorship
this
idea
was
rapidly
developed
and
we
soon
find
it
supported
in
ponderous
treatises
spread
widely
in
sermons
and
popularized
in
multitudes
of
inscriptions
cast
upon
the
bells
themselves
this
branch
of
theological
literature
may
still
be
studied
in
multitudes
of
church
towers
throughout
europe
a
bell
at
basel

the
inscription

these

became
matters
of
great
importance
popes

were
proud
to
stand
as
sponsors
four
of
the

at
the
cathedral
of
versailles
having
been
destroyed
during
the
french
revolution
four
new

were
baptized

the
voltairean
king
louis
xviii
and
the
pious
duchess
standing
as
sponsors
in
some
of
these
ceremonies
zeal
appears
to
have
outrun
knowledge
and
one
of
luther
stories
at
the
expense
of
the
older
church
was
that
certain
authorities
thus
christened
a
bell
hosanna
supposing
that
to
be
the
name
of
a
woman
to
add
to
the
efficacy
of
such
baptisms
water
was
sometimes
brought
from
the

see
montanus

beck

the
statement
that
many

were
carried

by

for
this

the
prayers
used
at
bell
baptisms
fully
recognise
this
doctrine
the

embraces
the
petition
that
whensoever
this

it
shall
drive
away
the
malign

of

assailing
spirits
the
horror
of
their

the
fiery

of
the
enemy
of

others
vary
the
form
but
not
the
substance
of
this
petition
the
great
jesuit
theologian
bellarmin
did
indeed
try
to
deny
the
reality
of
this
baptism
but
this
can
only
be
regarded
as
a
piece
of
casuistry
suited
to
protestant
hardness
of
heart
or
as
strategy
in
the
warfare
against
heretics
for
prayers
at
bell
baptisms
see

vol

forms
of
baptism
were
laid
down
in
various
manuals
sanctioned
directly
by
papal
authority
and
sacramental
efficacy
was
everywhere
taken
for
granted
the
development
of
this
idea
in
the
older
church
was
too
strong
to
be
resisted
but
as
a
rule
the
protestant
theologians
of
the
reformation
while
admitting
that
storms
were
caused
by
satan
and
his
legions
opposed
the
baptism
of
bells
and
denied
the
theory
of
their
influence
in
dispersing
storms
luther
while
never
doubting
that
troublesome
meteorological
phenomena
were
caused
by
devils
regarded
with
contempt
the
idea
that
the
demons
were
so
childish
as
to
be
scared
by
the
clang
of
bells
his
theory
made
them
altogether
too
powerful
to
be
affected
by
means
so
trivial
the
great
english
reformers
while
also
accepting
very
generally
the
theory
of
diabolic
interference
in
storms
reproved
strongly
the
baptizing
of
bells
as
the
perversion
of
a
sacrament
and
involving
blasphemy
bishop
hooper
declared
reliance
upon
bells
to
drive
away
tempests
futile
bishop
pilkington
while
arguing
that
tempests
are
direct
instruments
of
god
wrath
is
very
severe
against
using
unlawful
means
and
among
these
he
names
the
hallowed
bell
and
these
opinions
were
very
generally
shared
by
the
leading
english
clergy
as
has
often
been
pointed
out
the
ceremony
was
in
all
its
details
even
to
the
sponsors
the
wrapping
a
garment
about
the
baptised
the
baptismal
fee
the
feast
precisely
the
same
as
when
a
child
was
baptised
magius
who
is
no
sceptic
relates
from
his
own
experience
an
instant
of
this
sort
where
a
certain
bishop
stood
sponsor
for
two
bells
giving
them
both
his
own
name
william
see
his
de
tintinnabulis
vol
xiv
and
no
wonder
when
the
oracle
of
the
church
thomas
aquinas
expressly
pronounced
church
bells
provided
they
have
been
duly
consecrated
and
baptised
the
foremost
means
of
frustrating
the
atmospheric
mischiefs
of
the
devil
and
likened
steeples
in
which
bells
are
ringing
to
a
hen
brooding
her
chickens
for
the
tones
of
the
consecrated
metal
repel
the
demons
and
avert
storm
and
lightning
when
preachers
of
such
universal
currency
as
johannes
herolt
declared
bells
as
all
agree
are
baptised
with
the
result
that
they
are
secure
from
the
power
of
satan
terrify
the
demons
compel
the
powers
when
geiler
of
kaiserberg
especially
commended
as
a
means
of
beating
off
the
devil
in
storms
and
when
a
canonist
like
durandus
explained
the
purpose
of
the
rite
to
be
that
the
demons
hearing
the
trumpets
of
the
eternal
king
to
wit
the
bells
may
flee
in
terror
and
may
cease
from
the
stirring
up
of
tempests

the
baptism
of
bells
was
indeed
one
of
the
express
complaints
of
the
german
protestant
princes
at
the
reformation
see
their
gravam
cent
german
for
hooper
see
his
early
writings
in
parker
society
publications
for
pilkington
see
his
works
in
same
among
others
sharing
these
opinions
were
tyndale
bishop
ridley
archbishop
sandys
becon
calfhill
and
rogers
it
is
to
be
noted
that
all
of
these
speak
of
the
rite
as
baptism
toward
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
elector
of
saxony
strictly
forbade
the
ringing
of
bells
against
storms
urging
penance
and
prayer
instead
but
the
custom
was
not
so
easily
driven
out
of
the
protestant
church
and
in
some
quarters
was
developed
a
protestant
theory
of
a
rationalistic
sort
ascribing
the
good
effects
of
in
storms
to
the
calling
together
of
the
devout
for
prayer
or
to
the
suggestion
of
prayers
during
storms
at
night
as
late
as
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
we
find
the
bells
of
protestant
churches
in
northern
germany
rung
for
the
dispelling
of
tempests
in
catholic
austria
this
seems
to
have
become
a
nuisance
in
the
last
century
for
the
emperor
joseph
ii
found
it
necessary
to
issue
an
edict
against
it
but
this
doctrine
had
gained
too
large
headway
to
be
arrested
by
argument
or
edict
and
the
bells
may
be
heard
ringing
during
storms
to
this
day
in
various
remote
districts
in
europe
for
this
was
no
mere
superficial
view
it
was
really
part
of
a
deep
theological
current
steadily
developed
through
the
middle
ages
the
fundamental
idea
of
the
whole
being
the
direct
influence
of
the
bells
upon
the
power
of
the
air
and
it
is
perhaps
worth
our
while
to
go
back
a
little
and
glance
over
the
coming
of
this
current
into
the
modern
world
having
grown
steadily
through
the
middle
ages
it
appeared
in
full
strength
at
the
reformation
period
and
in
the
sixteenth
century
olaus
magnus
archbishop
of
upsala
and
primate
of
sweden
in
his
great
work
on
the
northern
nations
declares
it
a
fact
that
cities
and
harvests
may
be
saved
from
lightning
by
the
ringing
of
bells
and
the
burning
of
consecrated
incense
accompanied
by
prayers
and
he
cautions
his
readers
that
the
workings
of
the
thunderbolt
are
rather
to
be
marvelled
at
than
inquired
into
even
as
late
as
the
franciscan
professor
lealus
in
italy
in
a
schoolbook
which
was
received
with
great
applause
in
his
region
taught
unhesitatingly
the
agency
of
demons
in
storms
and
the
power
of
bells
over
them
as
well
as
the
portentousness
of
comets
and
the
movement
of
the
heavens
by
angels
he
dwells
especially
too
upon
the
perfect
protection
afforded
by
the
waxen
agnus
dei
how
strong
this
current
was
and
how
difficult
even
for
philosophical
minds
to
oppose
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
both
descartes
and
francis
bacon
speak
of
it
with
respect
admitting
the
fact
and
suggesting
very
mildly
that
the
bells
may
accomplish
this
purpose

the

in

he
again
alludes
to
the
belief
and
without
comment
but
no
such
moderate
doctrine
sufficed
and
the
renowned
bishop
binsfeld
of
treves
in
his
noted
treatise
on
the
credibility
of
the
confessions
of
witches
gave
an
entire
chapter
to
the
effect
of
bells
in
calming
atmospheric
disturbances
basing
his
general
doctrine
upon
the
first
chapter
of
job
and
the
second
chapter
of
ephesians
he
insisted
on
the
reality
of
diabolic
agency
in
storms
and
then
by
theological
reasoning
corroborated
by
the
statements
extorted
in
the
torture
chamber
he
showed
the
efficacy
of
bells
in
putting
the
hellish
legions
to
flight
this
continued
therefore
an
accepted
tenet
developed
in
every
nation
and
coming
to
its
climax
near
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
at
that
period
the
period
of
isaac
newton
father
augustine
de
angelis
rector
of
the
clementine
college
at
rome
published
under
the
highest
church
authority
his
lectures
upon
meteorology
coming
from
the
centre
of
catholic
christendom
at
so
late
a
period
they
are
very
important
as
indicating
what
had
been
developed
under
the
influence
of
theology
during
nearly
seventeen
hundred
years
this
learned
head
of
a
great
college
at
the
heart
of
christendom
taught
that
the
surest
remedy
against
thunder
is
that
which
our
holy
mother
the
church
practises
namely
the
ringing
of
bells
when
a
thunderbolt
impends
thence
follows
a
twofold
effect
physical
and
moral
a
physical
because
the
sound
variously
disturbs
and
agitates
the
air
and
by
agitation
disperses
the
hot
exhalations
and
dispels
the
thunder
but
the
moral
effect
is
the
more
certain
because
by
the
sound
the
faithful
are
stirred
to
pour
forth
their
prayers
by
which
they
win
from
god
the
turning
away
of
the
thunderbolt
here
we
see
in
this
branch
of
thought
as
in
so

others

close
of

seventeenth
century

preparing

compromise

but
while
this
comparatively
harmless
doctrine
of
thwarting
the
powers
of
the
air
by
fetiches
and
was
developed
there
were
evolved
another
theory
and
a
series
of
practices
sanctioned
by
the
church
which
must
forever
be
considered
as
among
the
most
fearful
calamities
in

indeed
few
errors
have
ever
cost
so
much
shedding
of
innocent
blood
over
such
wide
territory
and
during
so
many
generations
out
of
the
old
doctrine
pagan
and
christian
of
evil
agency
in
atmospheric
phenomena
was
evolved
the
belief
that
certain
men
women
and
children
may
secure
infernal
aid
to
produce
whirlwinds
hail
frosts
floods
and
the
like
as
early
as

ninth

one
great
churchman
agobard
archbishop
of

struck
a
heavy
blow
at
this
superstition
his
work
against
the
absurd
opinion
of

vulgar
touching

him
to
have
been
one
of
the
most
devoted
apostles
of
right
reason
whom
human
history
has
known

at
times
by

lofty
eloquence

breast
this
tide

passage

significance
he
declares

wretched

of

of
such
absurdity
as
no

exhorting

countries

the
application
of

to
thousands
of

in
accordance
with
the
precepts
laid
down
in
the
malleus
it
was
not
difficult
to
extract
masses
of
proof
for
this
sacred
theory
of

the
poor
creatures
writhing
on
the
rack
held
in
horror
by
those
who
had
been
nearest
and
dearest
to
them
anxious
only
for
death
to
relieve
their
sufferings
confessed
to
anything
and
everything
that
would
satisfy
the
inquisitors
and
judges
all
that
was
needed
was
that
the
inquisitors
should
ask
leading
questions
and
suggest
satisfactory
answers
the
prisoners
to
shorten
the
torture
were
sure
sooner
or
later
to
give
the
answer
required
even
though
they
knew
that
this
would
send
them
to
the
stake
or
scaffold
under
the
doctrine
of
excepted
cases
there
was
no
limit
to
torture
for
persons
accused
of
heresy
or
witchcraft
even
the
safeguards
which
the
old
pagan
world
had
imposed
upon
torture
were
thus
thrown
down
and
the
prisoner
must
confess

father

gives
a
similar
list
for

by

manuscript
lists
of
this
sort
which
have
actually
done
service
in
the
courts
of
baden
and
bavaria
may
be
seen
in
the
library
of
cornell
university
the
theological
literature
of
the
middle
ages
was
thus
enriched
with
numberless
statements
regarding
modes
of
satanic
influence
on
the
weather
pathetic
indeed
are
the
records
and
none
more
so
than
the
confessions
of
these
poor
creatures
chiefly
women
and
children
during
hundreds
of
years
as
to
their
manner
of
raising
hailstorms
and
tempests
such
confessions
by
tens
of
thousands
are
still
to
be
found
in
the
judicial
records
of
germany
and
indeed
of
all
europe
typical
among
these
is
one
on
which
great
stress
was
laid
during
ages
and
for
which
the
world
was
first
indebted
to
one
of
these
poor
women
crazed
by
the
agony
of
torture
she
declared
that
returning
with
a
demon
through
the
air
from
the
witches
sabbath
she
was
dropped
upon
the
earth
in
the
confusion
which
resulted
among
the
hellish
legions
when
they
heard
the
bells
sounding
the
ave
maria
it
is
sad
to
note
that
after
a
contribution
so
valuable
to
sacred
science
the
poor
woman
was
condemned
to
the
flames
this
revelation
speedily
ripened
the
belief
that
whatever
might
be
going
on
at
the
witches
sabbath
no
matter
how
triumphant
satan
might
be
at
the
moment
of
sounding
the
consecrated
bells
the
satanic
power
was
paralyzed
this
theory
once
started
proofs
came
in
to
support
it
during
a
hundred
years
from
the
torture
chambers
in
all
parts
of
europe
throughout
the
later
middle
ages
the
dominicans
had
been
the
main
agents
in
extorting
and
promulgating
these
revelations
but
in
the
centuries
following
the
reformation
the
jesuits
devoted
themselves
with
even
more
keenness
and
vigour
to
the
same
task
some
curious
questions
incidentally
arose
it
was
mooted
among
the
orthodox
authorities
whether
the
damage
done
by
storms
should
or
should
not
be
assessed
upon
the
property
of
convicted
witches
the
theologians
inclined
decidedly
to
the
affirmative
the
jurists
on
the
whole
to
the
negative
for
proofs
of
the
vigour
of
the
jesuits
in
this
persecution
see
not
only
the
histories
of
witchcraft
but
also
the
annuae
litterae
of
the
jesuits
themselves
passim
in
spite
of
these
tortures
lightning
and
tempests
continued
and
great
men
arose
in
the
church
throughout
europe
in
every
generation
to
point
out
new
cruelties
for
the
discovery
of
and
new
methods
for
bringing
their
machinations
to
naught
but
here
and
there
as
early
as
the
sixteenth
century
we
begin
to
see
thinkers
endeavouring
to
modify
or
oppose
these
methods
at
that
time
paracelsus
called
attention
to
the
reverberation
of
cannon
as
explaining
the
rolling
of
thunder
but
he
was
confronted
by
one
of
his
greatest
contemporaries
jean
bodin
as
superstitious
in
natural
as
he
was
rational
in
political
science
made
sport
of
the
scientific
theory
and
declared
thunder
to
be
a
flaming
exhalation
set
in
motion
by
evil
spirits
and
hurled
downward
with
a
great
crash
and
a
horrible
smell
of
sulphur
in
support
of
this
view
he
dwelt
upon
the
confessions
of
tortured
witches
upon
the
acknowledged
agency
of
demons
in
the
and
specially
upon
the
passage
in
the
one
hundred
and
fourth
psalm
who
maketh
his
angels
spirits
his
ministers
a
flaming
fire
to
resist
such
powerful
arguments
by
such
powerful
men
was
dangerous
indeed
in
pomponatius
professor
at
padua
published
a
volume
of
doubts
as
to
the
fourth
book
of
aristotle
meteorologica
and
also
dared
to
question
this
power
of
devils
but
he
soon
found
it
advisable
to
explain
that
while
as
a
philosopher
he
might
doubt
yet
as
a
christian
he
of
course
believed
everything
taught
by
mother
church
devils
and
all
and
so
escaped
the
fate
of
several
others
who
dared
to
question
the
agency
of
witches
in
atmospheric
and
other
disturbances
a
few
years
later
agrippa
of
nettesheim
made
a
somewhat
similar
effort
to
breast
this
theological
tide
in
northern
europe
he
had
won
a
great
reputation
in
various
fields
but
especially
in
natural
science
as
science
was
then
understood
seeing
the
folly
and
cruelty
of
the
prevailing
theory
he
attempted
to
modify
it
and
in
as
syndic
of
metz
endeavoured
to
save
a
poor
woman
on
trial
for
witchcraft
but
the
chief
inquisitor
backed
by
the
sacred
scriptures
the
papal
bulls
the
theological
faculties
and
the
monks
was
too
strong
for
him
he
was
not
only
forced
to
give
up
his
office
but
for
this
and
other
offences
of
a
similar
sort
was
imprisoned
driven
from
city
to
city
and
from
country
to
country
and
after
his
death
his
clerical
enemies
especially
the
dominicans
pursued
his
memory
with
calumny
and
placed
over
his
grave
probably
the
most
malignant
epitaph
ever
written
as
to
argument
these
efforts
were
met
especially
by
jean
bodin
in
his
famous
book
the
demonomanie
des
sorciers
published
in
it
was
a
work
of
great
power
by
a
man
justly
considered
the
leading
thinker
in
france
and
perhaps
in
europe
all
the
learning
of
the
time
divine
and
human
he
marshalled
in
support
of
the
prevailing
theory
with
inexorable
logic
he
showed
that
both
the
veracity
of
sacred
scripture
and
the
infallibility
of
a
long
line
of
popes
and
councils
of
the
church
were
pledged
to
it
and
in
an
eloquent
passage
this
great
publicist
warned
rulers
and
judges
against
any
mercy
to
witches
citing
the
example
of
king
ahab
condemned
by
the
prophet
to
die
for
having
pardoned
a
man
worthy
of
death
and
pointing
significantly
to
king
charles
ix
of
france
who
having
pardoned
a
sorcerer
died
soon
afterward
to
the
argument
cited
above

in
the
last
years
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
persecutions
for
witchcraft
and
magic
were
therefore
especially
cruel
and
in
the
western
districts
of
germany
the
main
instrument
in
them
was
binsfeld
suffragan
bishop
of
treves
at
that
time
cornelius
loos
was
a
professor
at
the
university
of
that
city
he
was
a
devoted
churchman
and
one
of
the
most
brilliant
opponents
of
protestantism
but
he
finally
saw
through
the
prevailing
belief
regarding
occult
powers
and
in
an
evil
hour
for
himself
embodied
his
idea
in
a
book
entitled
true
and
false
magic
the
book
though
earnest
was
temperate
but
this
helped
him
and
his
cause
not
at
all
the
texts
of
scripture
clearly
sanctioning
belief
in
sorcery
and
magic
stood
against
him
and
these
had
been
confirmed
by
the
infallible
teachings
of
the
church
and
the
popes
from
time
immemorial
the
book
was
stopped
in
the
press
the
manuscript
confiscated
and
loos
thrown
into
a
dungeon
the
inquisitors
having
wrought
their
will
upon
him
in
the
spring
of
he
was
brought
out
of
prison
forced
to
recant
on
his
knees
before
the
assembled
dignitaries
of
the
church
and
thenceforward
kept
constantly
under
surveillance
and
at
times
in
prison
even
this
was
considered
too
light
a
punishment
and
his
the
jesuit
delrio
declared
that
but
for
his
death
by
the
plague
he
would
have
been
finally
sent
to
the
stake
what
remains
of
the
manuscript
of
loos
which
until
recently
was
supposed
to
be
lost
was
found
hidden
away
on
the
shelves
of
the
old
jesuit
library
at
treves
by
george
lincoln
burr
now
a
professor
at

the
manuscript

the
facts
regarding
the
of
loos
were
discovered
by
burr
in
manuscript
records
at
brussels
that
this
threat
was
not
unmeaning
had
been
seen
a
few
years
earlier
in
a
case
even
more
noted
and
in
the
same
city
during
the
last
decades
of
the
sixteenth
century
dietrich
flade
an
eminent
jurist
was
rector
of
the
university
of
treves
and
chief
judge
of
the
electoral
court
and
in
the
latter
capacity
he
had
to
pass
judgment
upon
persons
tried
on
the
capital
charge
of
magic
and
witchcraft
for
a
time
he
yielded
to
the
long
line
of
authorities
ecclesiastical
and
judicial
supporting
the
reality
of
this
crime
but
he
at
last
seems
to
have
realized
that
it
was
unreal
and
that
the
confessions
in
his
torture
chamber
of
compacts
with
satan
riding
on
broomsticks
to
the
raising
tempests
producing
diseases
and
the
like
were
either
the
results
of
madness
or
of
willingness
to
confess
anything
and
everything
and
even
to
die
in
order
to
shorten
the
fearful
tortures
to
which
the
accused
were
in
all
cases
subjected
until
a
satisfactory
confession
was
obtained
on
this
conviction
of
the
unreality
of
many
at
least
of
the
charges
flade
seems
to
have
acted
and
he
at
once
received
his
reward
he
was
arrested
by
the
authority
of
the
archbishop
and
charged
with
having
sold
himself
to
satan
the
fact
of
his
hesitation
in
the
persecution
being
perhaps
what
suggested
his
guilt
he
was
now
in
his
turn
brought
into
the
torture
chamber
over
which
he
had
once
presided
was
racked
until
he
confessed
everything
which
his
torturers
suggested
and
finally
in
was
strangled
and
burnt
of
that
trial
a
record
exists
in
the
library
of
cornell
university
in
the
shape
of
the
original
minutes
of
the
case
and
among
them
the
depositions
of
flade
when
under
torture
taken
down
from
his
own
lips
in
the
torture
chamber
in
these
depositions
this
revered
and
venerable
scholar
and
jurist
acknowledged
the
truth
of
every
absurd
charge
brought
against
him
anything
everything
which
would
end
the
fearful
torture
compared
with
that
death
was
nothing
for
the
case
of
flade
see
the
careful
study
by
burr
the
fate
of
dietrich
flade
in
the
papers
of
the
american
historical
association
nor
was
even
a
priest
secure
who
ventured
to
reveal
the
unreality
of
magic
when
friedrich
spee
the
jesuit
poet
of
western
germany
found
in
taking
the
confessions
of
those
about
to
be
executed
for
magic
that
without
exception
just
when
about
to
enter
eternity
and
utterly
beyond
hope
of
pardon
they
all
retracted
their
confessions
made
under
torture
his
sympathies
as
a
man
rose
above
his
loyalty
to
his
order
and
he
published
his
cautio
criminalis
as
a
warning
stating
with
entire
moderation
the
facts
he
had
observed
and
the
necessity
of
care
but
he
did
not
dare
publish
it
under
his
own
name
nor
did
he
even
dare
publish
it
in
a
catholic
town
he
gave
it
to
the
world
anonymously
and
in
order
to
prevent
any
tracing
of
the
work
to
him
through
the
confessional
he
secretly
caused
it
to
be
published
in
the
protestant
town
of
rinteln
nor
was
this
all
nothing
shows
so
thoroughly
the
hold
that
this
belief
in
magic
had
obtained
as
the
conduct
of
spee
powerful
friend
and
contemporary
john
philip
von
schonborn
later
the
elector
and
prince
archbishop
of
mayence
as
a
youth
schonborn
had
loved
and
admired
spee
and
had
especially
noted
his
persistent
melancholy
and
his
hair
whitened
even
in
his
young
manhood
on
schonborn
pressing
him
for
the
cause
spee
at
last
confessed
that
his
sadness
whitened
hair
and
premature
old
age
were
due
to
his
recollections
of
the
scores
of
men
and
women
and
children
whom
he
had
been
obliged
to
see
tortured
and
sent
to
the
scaffold
and
stake
for
magic
and
witchcraft
when
he
as
their
father
confessor
positively
knew
them
to
be
innocent
the
result
was
that
when
schonborn
became
elector
and
archbishop
of
mayence
he
stopped
the
witch
persecutions
in
that
province
and
prevented
them
as
long
as
he
lived
but
here
was
shown
the
strength
of
theological
and
ecclesiastical
traditions
and
precedents
even
a
man
so
strong
by
family
connections
and
enjoying
such
great
temporal
and
spiritual
power
as
schonborn
dared
not
openly
give
his
reasons
for
this
change
of
policy
so
far
as
is
known
he
never
uttered
a
word
publicly
against
the
reality
of
magic
and
under
his
successor
in
the
electorate
witch
trials
were
resumed
the
great
upholders
of
the
orthodox
view
retained
full
possession
of
the
field
the
victorious
bishop
binsfeld
of
treves
wrote
a
book
to
prove
that
everything
confessed
by
the
witches
under
torture
especially
the
raising
of
storms
and
the
general
controlling
of
the
weather
was
worthy
of
belief

book

throughout

fully
as
catholicism
in
the
same
century
john
wier
a
disciple
of
agrippa
tried
to
frame
a
pious
theory
which
while
satisfying
orthodoxy
should
do
something
to
check
the
frightful
cruelties
around
him
in
his
book
de
praestigiis
daemonum
published
in
he
proclaimed
his
belief
in
witchcraft
but
suggested
that
the
compacts
with
satan
journeys
through
the
air
on
broomsticks
bearing
children
to
satan
raising
storms
and
producing
diseases
to
which
so
many
women
and
children
confessed
under
torture
were
delusions
suggested
and
propagated
by
satan
himself
and
that
the
persons
charged
with
witchcraft
were
therefore
to
be
considered
as
possessed
that
is
rather
as
sinned
against
than
sinning
for
wier
or
weyer
see
besides
his
own
works
the
excellent
biography
by
binz
of
bonn
but
neither
catholics
nor
protestants
would
listen
for
a
moment
to
any
such
suggestion
wier
was
bitterly
denounced
and
persecuted
nor
did
bekker
a
protestant
divine
in
holland
fare
any
better
in
the
following
century
for
his
world
bewitched
in
which
he
ventured
not
only
to
question
the
devil
power
over
the
weather
but
to
deny
his
bodily
existence
altogether
he
was
solemnly
tried
by
the
synod
of
his
church
and
expelled
from
his
pulpit
while
his
views
were
condemned
as
heresy
and
overwhelmed
with
a
flood
of
refutations
whose
mere
catalogue
would
fill
pages
and
these
cases
were
typical
of
many
the
reformation
had
indeed
at
first
deepened
the
superstition
the
new
church
being
anxious
to
show
itself
equally
orthodox
and
zealous
with
the
old
during
the
century
following
the
first
great
movement
the
eminent
lutheran
jurist
and
theologian
benedict
carpzov
whose
boast
was
that
he
had
read
the
bible
times
especially
distinguished
himself
by
his
skill
in
demonstrating
the
reality
of
witchcraft
and
by
his
cruelty
in
detecting
and
punishing
it
the
torture
chambers
were
set
at
work
more
vigorously
than
ever
and
a
long
line
of
theological
jurists
followed
to
maintain
the
system
and
to
extend
it
to
argue
against
it
or
even
doubt
it
was
exceedingly
dangerous
even
as
late
as
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
when
christian
thomasius
the
greatest
and
bravest
german
between
luther
and
lessing
began
the
efforts
which
put
an
end
to
it
in
protestant
germany
he
did
not
dare
at
first
bold
as
he
was
to
attack
it
in
his
own
name
but
presented
his
views
as
the
university
thesis
of
an
irresponsible
student
for
thomasius
see
his
various
bigraphies
by
luden
and
others
also
the
treatises
on
witchcraft
by
soldan
and
others
manuscript
notes
of
his
lectures
and
copies
of
his
earliest
books
on
witchcraft
as
well
as
on
other
forms
of
folly
are
to
be
found
in
the
library
of
cornell
university
the
same
stubborn
resistance
to
the
gradual
encroachment
of
the
scientific
spirit
upon
the
orthodox
doctrine
of
witchcraft
was
seen
in
great
britain
typical
as
to
the
attitude
both
of
scotch
and
english
protestants
were
the
theory
and
practice
of
king
james
i
himself
the
author
of
a
book
on
demonology
and
nothing
if
not
a
theologian
as
to
theory
his
treatise
on
demonology
supported
the
worst
features
of
the
superstition
as
to
practice
he
ordered
the
learned
and
acute
work
of
reginald
scot
the
discoverie
of
witchcraft
one
of
the
best
treatises
ever
written
on
the
subject
to
be
burned
by
the
hangman
and
he
applied
his
own
knowledge
to
investigating
the
causes
of
the
tempests
which
beset
his
bride
on
her
voyage
from
denmark
skilful
use
of
unlimited
torture
soon
brought
these
causes
to
light
a
fian
while
his
legs
were
crushed
in
the
boots
and
wedges
were
driven
under
his
finger
nails
confessed
that
several
hundred
witches
had
gone
to
sea
in
a
sieve
from
the
port
of
leith
and
had
raised
storms
and
tempests
to
drive
back
the
princess
with
the
coming
in
of
the
puritans
the
persecution
was
even
more
largely
systematically
and
cruelly
developed
the
great
matthew
hopkins
having
gone
through
the
county
of
suffolk
and
tested
multitudes
of
poor
old
women
by
piercing
them
with
pins
and
needles
declared
that
county
to
be
infested
with
witches
thereupon
parliament
issued
a
commission
and
sent
two
eminent
presbyterian
divines
to
accompany
it
with
the
result
that
in
that
county
alone
sixty
persons
were
hanged
for
witchcraft
in
a
single
year
in
scotland
matters
were
even
worse
the
auto
da
fe
of
spain
was
celebrated
in
scotland
under
another
name
and
with
presbyterian
ministers
instead
of
roman
catholic
priests
as
the
main
attendants
at
leith
in
nine
women
were
burned
together
condemnations
and
punishments
of
women
in
batches
were
not
uncommon
torture
was
used
far
more
freely
than
in
england
both
in
detecting
witches
and
in
punishing
them
the
natural
argument
developed
in
hundreds
of
pulpits
was
this
if
the
allwise
god
punishes
his
creatures
with
tortures
infinite
in
cruelty
and
duration
why
should
not
his
ministers
as
far
as
they
can
imitate
him
the
strongest
minds
in
both
branches
of
the
protestant
church
in
great
britain
devoted
themselves
to
maintaining
the
superstition
the
newer
scientific
modes
of
thought
and
especially
the
new
ideas
regarding
the
heavens
revealed
first
by
copernicus
and
galileo
and
later
by
newton
huygens
and
halley
were
gradually
dissipating
the
whole
domain
of
the
prince
of
the
power
of
the
air
but
from
first
to
last
a
long
line
of
eminent
divines

and

to
resist

and
these
marshalled
in
behalf
of
this
cruel
superstition
a
long
line
of
eminent
divines
the
most
earnest
of
all
perhaps
being
john
wesley
nor
was
the
lutheran
church
in
sweden
and
the
other
scandinavian
countries
behind
its
sister
churches
either
in
persecuting
witchcraft
or
in
repressing
doubts
regarding
the
doctrine
which
supported
it
but
in
spite
of
all
these
great
authorities
in
every
land
in
spite
of
such
summary
punishments
as
those
of
flade
loos
and
bekker
and
in
spite
of
the
virtual
exclusion
from
church
preferment
of
all
who
doubted
the
old
doctrine
the
new
scientific
view
of
the
heavens
was
developed
more
and
more
the
physical
sciences
were
more
and
more
cultivated
the
new
scientific
atmosphere
in
general
more
and
more
prevailed
and
at
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
this
vast
growth
of
superstition
began
to
wither
and
droop
montaigne
bayle
and
voltaire
in
france
thomasius
in
germany
calef
in
new
england
and
beccaria
in
italy
did
much
also
to
create
an
intellectual
and
moral
atmosphere
fatal
to
it
and
here
it
should
be
stated
to
the
honour
of
the
church
of
england
that
several
of
her
divines
showed
great
courage
in
opposing
the
dominant
doctrine
such
men
as
harsnet
archbishop
of
york
and
morton
bishop
of
lichfield
who
threw
all
their
influence
against
cruelties
even
early
in
the
seventeenth
century
deserve
lasting
gratitude
but
especially
should
honour
be
paid
to
the
younger
men
in
the
church
who
wrote
at
length
against
the
whole
system
such
men
as
wagstaffe
and
webster
and
hutchinson
who
in
the
humbler
ranks
of
the
clergy
stood
manfully
for
truth
with
the
certainty
that
by
so
doing
they
were
making
their
own
promotion
impossible
by
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
doctrine
was
evidently
dying
out
where
torture
had
been
abolished
or
even
made
milder
no
longer
confessed
and
the
fundamental
proofs
in
which
the
system
was
rooted
were
evidently
slipping
away
even
the
great
theologian
fromundus
at
the
university
of
louvain
the
oracle
of
his
age
who
had
demonstrated
the
futility
of
the
copernican
theory
had
foreseen
this
and
made
the
inevitable
attempt
at
compromise
declaring
that
devils
though
often
are
not
always
or
even
for
the
most
part
the
causes
of
thunder
the
learned
jesuit
caspar
schott
whose
physica
curiosa
was
one
of
the
most
popular
books
of
the
seventeenth
century
also
ventured
to
make
the
same
mild
statement
but
even
such
concessions
by
such
great
champions
of
orthodoxy
did
not
prevent
frantic
efforts
in
various
quarters
to
bring
the
world
back
under
the
old
dogma
as
late
as
there
was
published
in
catholic
germany
a
manual
by
father
vincent
of
berg
in
which
the
superstition
was
taught
to
its
fullest
extent
with
the
declaration
that
it
was
issued
for
the
use
of
priests
under
the
express
sanction
of
the
theological
professors
of
the
university
of
cologne
and
years
later
in
we
find
in
protestant
england
john
wesley
standing
firmly
for
witchcraft
and
uttering
his
famous
declaration
the
giving
up
of
witchcraft
is
in
effect
the
giving
up
of
the
bible
the
latest
notable
demonstration
in
scotland
was
made
as
late
as
when
the
divines
of
the
associated
presbytery
passed
a
resolution
declaring
their
belief
in
witchcraft
and
deploring

scepticism

by

in

of

by

like

and
by
protestants
like
john
wesley
to
save
the
old
sacred
theory
it
received
its
in
franklin
made
his
experiments
with
the
kite
on
the
banks
of
the
schuylkill
and
at
the
moment
when
he
drew
the
electric
spark
from
the
cloud
the
whole
tremendous
fabric
of
theological
meteorology
reared
by
the
fathers
the
popes
the
medieval
doctors
and
the
long
line
of
great
theologians
catholic
and
protestant
collapsed
the
prince
of
the
power
of
the
air
tumbled
from
his
seat
the
great
doctrine
which
had
so
long
afflicted
the
earth
was
prostrated
forever
the
experiment
of
franklin
was
repeated
in
various
parts
of
europe
but
at
first
the
church
seemed
careful
to
take
no
notice
of
it
the
old
church
formulas
against
the
prince
of
the
power
of
the
air
were
still
used
but
the
theological
theory
especially
in
the
protestant
church
began
to
grow
milder
four
years
after
franklin
discovery
pastor
karl
koken
member
of
the
consistory
and
official
preacher
to
the
city
council
of
hildesheim
was
moved
by
a
great
hailstorm
to
preach
and
publish
a
sermon
on
the
revelation
of
god
in
weather
of
the
prince
of
the
power
of
the
air
he
says
nothing
the
theory
of
diabolical
agency
he
throws
overboard
altogether
his
whole
attempt
is
to
save
the
older
and
more
harmless
theory
that
the
storm
is
the
voice
of
god
he
insists
that
since
christ
told
nicodemus
that
men
know
not
whence
the
wind
cometh
it
can
not
be
of
mere
natural
origin
but
is
sent
directly
by
god
himself
as
david
intimates
in
the
psalm
out
of
his
secret
places
as
to
the
hailstorm
he
lays
great
stress
upon
the
plague
of
hail
sent
by
the
almighty
upon
egypt
and
clinches
all
by
insisting
that
god
showed
at
mount
sinai
his
purpose
to
startle
the
body
before
impressing
the
conscience
while
the
theory
of
diabolical
agency
in
storms
was
thus
drooping
and
dying
very
shrewd
efforts
were
made
at
compromise
the
first
of
these
attempts
we
have
already
noted
in
the
effort
to
explain
the
efficacy
of
bells
in
storms
by
their
simple
use
in
stirring
the
faithful
to
prayer
and
in
the
concession
made
by
sundry
theologians
and
even
by
the
great
lord
bacon
himself
that
church
bells
might
under
the
sanction
of
providence
disperse
storms
by
agitating
the
air
this
gained
ground
somewhat
though
it
was
resisted
by
one
eminent
church
authority
who
answered
shrewdly
that
in
that
case
cannon
would
be
even
more
pious
instruments
still
another
argument
used
in
trying
to
save
this
part
of
the
theological
theory
was
that
the
bells
were
consecrated
instruments
for
this
purpose
like
the
horns
at
whose
blowing
the
walls
of
jericho
fell
for
koken
see
his
offenbarung
gottes
in
wetter
hildesheim
and
for
the
answer
to
bacon
see
gretser
de
benedictionibus
lib
ii
cap
but
these
compromises
were
of
little
avail
in
father
sterzinger
attacked
the
very
groundwork
of
the
whole
diabolic
theory
he
was
of
course
bitterly
assailed
insulted
and
hated
but
the
church
thought
it
best
not
to
condemn
him
more
and
more
the
prince
of
the
power
of
the
air
retreated
before
the
of
franklin
the
older
church
while
clinging
to
the
old
theory
was
finally
obliged
to
confess
the
supremacy
of
franklin
theory
practically
for
his
did
what
exorcisms
and
holy
water
and
processions
and
the
agnus
dei
and
the
ringing
of
church
bells
and
the
rack
and
the
burning
of
witches
had
failed
to
do
this
was
clearly
seen
even
by
the
poorest
peasants
in
eastern
france
when
they
observed
that
the
grand
spire
of
strasburg
cathedral
which
neither
the
sacredness
of
the
place
nor
the
bells
within
it
nor
the
holy
water
and
relics
beneath
it
could
protect
from
frequent
injuries
by
lightning
was
once
and
for
all
protected
by
franklin
rod
then
came
into
the
minds
of
multitudes
the
answer
to
the
question
which
had
so
long
exercised
the
leading
theologians
of
europe
and
america
namely
why
should
the
almighty
strike
his
own
consecrated
temples
or
suffer
satan
to
strike
them
yet
even
this
practical
solution
of
the
question
was
not
received
without
opposition
in
america
the
earthquake
of
was
widely
ascribed
especially
in
massachusetts
to
franklin
rod
the
rev
thomas
prince
pastor
of
the
old
south
church
published
a
sermon
on
the
subject
and
in
the
appendix
expressed
the
opinion
that
the
frequency
of
earthquakes
may
be
due
to
the
erection
of
iron
points
invented
by
the
sagacious
mr
franklin
he
goes
on
to
argue
that
in
boston
are
more
erected
than
anywhere
else
in
new
england
and
boston
seems
to
be
more
dreadfully
shaken
oh
there
is
no
getting
out
of
the
mighty
hand
of
god
three
years
later
john
adams
speaking
of
a
conversation
with
arbuthnot
a
boston
physician
says
he
began
to
prate
upon
the
presumption
of
philosophy
in
erecting
iron
rods
to
draw
the
lightning
from
the
clouds
he
railed
and
foamed
against
the
points
and
the
presumption
that
erected
them
he
talked
of
presuming
upon
god
as
peter
attempted
to
walk
upon
the
water
and
of
attempting
to
control
the
artillery
of
heaven
as
late
as
religious
scruples
regarding
were
still
felt
the
theory
being
that
as
thunder
and
lightning
were
tokens
of
the
divine
displeasure
it
was
impiety
to
prevent
their
doing
their
full
work
fortunately
john
winthrop
of
harvard
showed
himself
wise
in
this
as
in
so
many
other
things
in
a
lecture
on
earthquakes
he
opposed
the
dominant
theology
and
as
to
arguments
against
rods
he
declared
it
is
as
much
our
duty
to
secure
ourselves
against
the
effects
of
lightning
as
against
those
of
rain
snow
and
wind
by
the
means
god
has
put
into
our
hands
still
for
some
years
theological
sentiment
had
to
be
regarded
carefully
in
philadelphia
a
popular
lecturer
on
science
for
some
time
after
franklin
discovery
thought
it
best
in
advertising
his
lectures
to
explain
that
the
erection
of
is
not
chargeable
with
presumption
nor
inconsistent
with
any
of
the
principles
either
of
natural
or
revealed
religion

opposition

franklin

the
first
lightning
conductor
upon
a
church
was
not
put
up
until
ten
years
after
franklin
discovery
the
spire
of
bride
church
in
london
was
greatly
injured
by
lightning
in
and
in
a
storm
so
wrecked
its
masonry
that
it
had
to
be
mainly
rebuilt
yet
for
years
after
this
the
authorities
refused
to
attach
a
the
protestant
cathedral
of
paul
in
london
was
not
protected
until
sixteen
years
after
franklin
discovery
and
the
tower
of
the
great
protestant
church
at
hamburg
not
until
a
year
later
still
as
late
as
it
was
declared
in
germany
on
excellent
authority
that
within
a
space
of
years
nearly
four
hundred
towers
had
been
damaged
and
one
hundred
and
twenty
killed
in
roman
catholic
countries
a
similar
prejudice
was
shown
and
its
cost
at
times
was
heavy
in
austria
the
church
of
rosenberg
in
the
mountains
of
carinthia
was
struck
so
frequently
and
with
such
loss
of
life
that
the
peasants
feared
at
last
to
attend
service
three
times
was
the
spire
rebuilt
and
it
was
not
until
years
after
franklin
discovery
that
the
authorities
permitted
a
rod
to
be
attached
then
all
trouble
ceased
a
typical
case
in
italy
was
that
of
the
tower
of
mark
at
venice
in
spite
of
the
angel
at
its
summit
and
the
bells
consecrated
to
ward
off
the
powers
of
the
air
and
the
relics
in
the
cathedral
hard
by
and
the
processions
in
the
adjacent
square
the
tower
was
frequently
injured
and
even
ruined
by
lightning
in
it
was
badly
shattered
in
and
again
in
the
wooden
spire
surmounting
it
was
utterly
consumed
it
was
again
greatly
injured
in
and
in
was
struck
so
powerfully
that
the
whole
tower
which
had
been
rebuilt
of
stone
and
brick
was
shattered
in
places
although
the
invention
of
franklin
had
been
introduced
into
italy
by
the
physicist
beccaria
the
tower
of
mark
still
went
unprotected
and
was
again
badly
struck
in
and
and
not
until
fourteen
years
after
discovery
was
a
placed
upon
it
and
it
has
never
been
struck
since
for
reluctance
in
england
to
protect
churches
with
rods
see
priestley
history
of
electricity
london
vol
i
pp
et
seq
so
too
though
the
beautiful
tower
of
the
cathedral
of
siena
protected
by
all
possible
theological
means
had
been
struck
again
and
again
much
opposition
was
shown
to
placing
upon
it
what
was
generally
known
as
the
heretical
rod
but
the
tower
was
at
last
protected
by
invention
and
in
though
a
very
heavy
bolt
passed
down
the
rod
the
church
received
not
the
slightest
injury
this
served
to
reconcile
theology
and
science
so
far
as
that
city
was
concerned
but
the
case
which
did
most
to
convert
the
italian
theologians
to
the
scientific
view
was
that
of
the
church
of
san
nazaro
at
brescia
the
republic
of
venice
had
stored
in
the
vaults
of
this
church
over
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
of
powder
in
seventeen
years
after
franklin
discovery
no
rod
having
been
placed
upon
it
it
was
struck
by
lightning
the
powder
in
the
vaults
was
exploded
one
sixth
of
the
entire
city
destroyed
and
over
three
thousand
lives
were
lost
see
article
on
lightning
in
the
edinburgh
review
for
october
such
examples
as
these
in
all
parts
of
europe
had
their
effect
the
formulas
for
conjuring
off
storms
for
consecrating
bells
to
ward
off
lightning
and
tempests
and
for
putting
to
flight
the
powers
of
the
air
were
still
allowed
to
stand
in
the
liturgies
but
the
the
barometer
and
the
thermometer
carried
the
day
a
vigorous
line
of
investigators
succeeding
franklin
completed
his
victory
the
traveller
in
remote
districts
of
europe
still
hears
the
church
bells
ringing
during
tempests
the
polish
or
italian
peasant
is
still
persuaded
to
pay
fees
for
sounding
bells
to
keep
off
hailstorms
but
the
universal
tendency
favours
more
and
more
the
use
of
the
and
of
the
insurance
offices
where
men
can
be
relieved
of
the
ruinous
results
of
meteorological
disturbances
in
accordance
with
the
scientific
laws
of
average
based
upon
the
ascertained
recurrence
of
storms
so
too
though
many
a
poor
seaman
trusts
to
his
charm
that
has
been
bathed
in
holy
water
or
that
has
touched
some
relic
the
tendency
among
mariners
is
to
value
more
and
more
those
warnings
which
are
sent
far
and
wide
each
day
over
the
earth
and
under
the
sea
by
the
electric
wires
in
accordance
with
laws
ascertained
by
observation
yet
even
in
our
own
time
attempts
to
revive
the
old
theological
doctrine
of
meteorology
have
not
been
wanting
two
of
these
one
in
a
roman
catholic
and
another
in
a
protestant
country
will
serve
as
types
of
many
to
show
how
completely
scientific
truth
has
saturated
and
permeated
minds
supposed
to
be
entirely
surrendered
to
the
theological
view
the
island
of
honorat
just
off
the
southern
coast
of
france
is
deservedly
one
of
the
places
most
venerated
in
christendom
the
monastery
of
lerins
founded
there
in
the
fourth
century
became
a
mother
of
similar
institutions
in
western
europe
and
a
centre
of
religious
teaching
for
the
christian
world
in
its
atmosphere
legends
and
myths
grew
in
beauty
and
luxuriance
here
as
the
chroniclers
tell
us
at
the
touch
of
honorat
burst
forth
a
stream
of
living
water
which
a
recent
historian
of
the
monastery
declares
a
greater
miracle
than
that
of
moses
here
he
destroyed
with
a
touch
of
his
staff
the
reptiles
which
infested
the
island
and
then
forced
the
sea
to
wash
away
their
foul
remains
here
to
please
his
sister
a
cherry
tree
burst
into
full
bloom
every
month
here
he
threw
his
cloak
upon
the
waters
and
it
became
a
raft
which
bore
him
safely
to
visit
the
neighbouring
island
here
patrick
received
from
just
the
staff
with
which
he
imitated
honorat
by
driving
all
reptiles
from
ireland
pillaged
by
saracens
and
pirates
the
island
was
made
all
the
more
precious
by
the
blood
of
christian
martyrs
popes
and
kings
made
pilgrimages
to
it
saints
confessors
and
bishops
went
forth
from
it
into
all
europe
in
one
of
its
cells
vincent
of
lerins
wrote
that
famous
definition
of
pure
religion
which
for
nearly
fifteen
hundred
years
has
virtually
superseded
that
of
james
naturally
the
monastery
became
most
illustrious
and
its
seat
the
mediterranean
isle
of
saints
but
toward
the
close
of
the
last
century
its
inmates
having
become
slothful
and
corrupt
it
was
dismantled
all
save
a
small
portion
torn
down
and
the
island
became
the
property
first
of
impiety
embodied
in
a
french
actress
and
finally
of
heresy
embodied
in
an
english
clergyman
bought
back
for
the
church
by
the
bishop
of
frejus
in
there
was
little
revival
of
life
for
twelve
years
then
came
the
reaction
religious
and
political
after
the
humiliation
of
france
and
the
vatican
by
germany
and
of
this
reaction
the
monastery
of
honorat
was
made
one
of
the
most
striking
outward
and
visible
signs
pius

himself
directly

into
it
a

of

it
became

restore
its
sacredness
the
strict
system
of

was
established
labour

the
word
thus
given
from

for
promotion
in

the

handsomely
rebuilt
and
a
multitude
of
altars
erected
and
beautiful
frescoes
and

windows
came
from
the
leaders
of
the
reaction
the
whole
effect
was
perhaps
somewhat
theatrical
and
thin
but
it
showed
none
the
less
earnestness
in
making
the
old
isle
of

a
protest
against
the
hated
modern
world
as
if
to
bid
defiance
still
further
to
modern

the
ages
of
faith
were
to

the

as
their
one
great

dwelt
upon
the
miracles
of

as
the
most
precious
refutation
of
modern
science
high
in
the
cupola
above
the
altars
and
relics
were
placed
the
bells
sent
by
pious
donors
they
were
solemnly
baptized
and
consecrated
in
four
bishops
officiating

multitude
of
the
faithful

present
from
all

the
good
bishop
who
baptized

consecrated
them
with
a
formula
announcing
their
efficacy
in
driving
away
the
prince
of
the
power
of
the
air
and
the
lightning
and
tempests
he
provokes
and
then
above
all
at
the
summit
of
the
central
spire
high
above
relics
altars
and
bells
was
placed
a
see

as

les

by
the
abbe
alliez
paris
and
the
histoire
de

by
the
same
author
are
the
authorities
for
the
general
history
of
the
abbey
and
are
especially
strong
in
presenting
the
miracles
of
honorat
etc
the
cartulaire
of
the
monastery
recently
published
is
also
valuable
but
these
do
not
cover
the
recent
revival
for
an
account
of
which
recourse
must
be
had
to
the
very
interesting
and
naive
guide
already
cited
the
account
of
the
monastery
published
under
the
direction
of
the
present
worthy
abbot
more
than
hints
at
the
saving
by
its
bells
of
a
ship
which
was
wrecked
a
few
years
since
on
that
coast
and
yet
to
protect
the
bells
and
church
and
monks
and
relics
from
the
very
foe
whom
in
the
medieval
faith
all
these
were
thought
most
powerful
to
drive
away
recourse
was
had
to
the
scientific
discovery
of
that
benjamin
franklin
perhaps
the
most
striking
recent
example
in
protestant
lands
of
this
change
from
the
old
to
the
new
occurred
not
long
since
in
one
of
the
great
pacific
dependencies
of
the
british
crown
at
a
time
of
severe
drought
an
appeal
was
made
to
the
bishop
moorhouse
to
order
public
prayers
for
rain
the
bishop
refused
advising
the
petitioners
for
the
future
to
take
better
care
of
their
water
supply
virtually
telling
them
heaven
helps
those
who
help
themselves
but
most
noteworthy
in
this
matter
was
it
that
the
english
government
not
long
after
scanning
the
horizon
to
find
some
man
to
take
up
the
good
work
laid
down
by
the
lamented
bishop
fraser
of
manchester
chose
moorhouse
and
his
utterance
upon
meteorology
which
a
few
generations
since
would
have
been
regarded
by
the
whole
church
as
blasphemy
was
universally
alluded
to
as
an
example
of
strong
good
sense
proving
him
especially
fit
for
one
of
the
most
important
bishoprics
in
england
throughout
christendom
the
prevalence
of
the
conviction
that
meteorology
is
obedient
to
laws
is
more
and
more
evident
in
cities
especially
where
men
are
accustomed
each
day
to
see
posted
in
public
places
charts
which
show
the
storms
moving
over
various
parts
of
the
country
and
to
read
in
the
morning
papers
scientific
prophecies
as
to
the
weather
the
old
view
can
hardly
be
very
influential
significant
of
this
was
the
feeling
of
the
american
people
during
the
fearful
droughts
a
few
years
since
in
the
states
west
of
the
missouri
no
days
were
appointed
for
fasting
and
prayer
to
bring
rain
there
was
no
attribution
of
the
calamity
to
the
wrath
of
god
or
the
malice
of
satan
but
much
was
said
regarding
the
folly
of
our
people
in
allowing
the
upper
regions
of
their
vast
rivers
to
be
denuded
of
forests
thus
subjecting
the
states
below
to
alternations
of
drought
and
deluge
partly
as
a
result
of
this
a
beginning
has
been
made
of
teaching
forest
culture
in
many
schools
societies
have
been
formed
and
arbor
day
is
recognised
in
several
of
the
states
a
true
and
noble
theology
can
hardly
fail
to
recognise
in
the
love
of
nature
and
care
for
our
thus
promoted
something
far
better
both
from
a
religious
and
a
moral
point
of
view
than
any
efforts
to
win
the
divine
favour
by
flattery
or
to
avert
satanic
malice

of
this

proper
the
first
distinct
impulse
toward
a
higher
view
of
research
into
natural
laws
was
given
by
the
philosophers
of
greece
it
is
true
that
philosophical
opposition
to
physical
research
was
at
times
strong
and
that
even
a
great
thinker
like
socrates
considered
certain
physical
investigations
as
an
impious
intrusion
into
the
work
of
the
gods
it
is
also
true
that
plato
and
aristotle
while
bringing
their
thoughts
to
bear
upon
the
world
with
great
beauty
and
force
did
much
to
draw
mankind
away
from
those
methods
which
in
modern
times
have
produced
the
best
results
plato
developed
a
world
in
which
the
physical
sciences
had
little
if
any
real
reason
for
existing
aristotle
a
world
in
which
the
same
sciences
were
developed
largely
indeed
by
observation
of
what
is
but
still
more
by
speculation
on
what
ought
to
be
from
the
former
of
these
two
great
men
came
into
christian
theology
many
germs
of
medieval
magic
and
from
the
latter
sundry
modes
of
reasoning
which
aided
in
the
evolution
of
these
yet
the
impulse
to
human
thought
given
by
these
great
masters
was
of
inestimable
value
to
our
race
and
one
legacy
from
them
was
especially
precious
the
idea
that
a
science
of
nature
is
possible
and
that
the
highest
occupation
of
man
is
the
discovery
of
its
laws
still
another
gift
from
them
was
greatest
of
all
for
they
gave
scientific
freedom
they
laid
no
interdict
upon
new
paths
they
interposed
no
barriers
to
the
extension
of
knowledge
they
threatened
no
doom
in
this
life
or
in
the
next
against
investigators
on
new
lines
they
left
the
world
free
to
seek
any
new
methods
and
to
follow
any
new
paths
which
thinking
men
could
find
this
legacy
of
belief
in
science
of
respect
for
scientific
pursuits
and
of
freedom
in
scientific
research
was
especially
received
by
the
school
of
alexandria
and
above
all
by
archimedes
who
began
just
before
the
christian
era
to
open
new
paths
through
the
great
field
of
the
inductive
sciences
by
observation
comparison
and
experiment
as
to
the
beginnings
of
physical
science
in
greece
and
of
the
theological
opposition
to
physical
science

the
supposed
opposition
to
freedom
of
opinion
in
the
laws
of
plato
toward
the
end
of
his
life
can
hardly
make
against
the
whole
spirit
of
greek
thought
the
establishment
of
christianity
beginning
a
new
evolution
of
theology
arrested
the
normal
development
of
the
physical
sciences
for
over
fifteen
hundred
years
the
cause
of
this
arrest
was
twofold
first
there
was
created
an
atmosphere
in
which
the
germs
of
physical
science
could
hardly
grow
an
atmosphere
in
which
all
seeking
in
nature
for
truth
as
truth
was
regarded
as
futile
the
general
belief
derived
from
the
new
testament
scriptures
was
that
the
end
of
the
world
was
at
hand
that
the
last
judgment
was
approaching
that
all
existing
physical
nature
was
soon
to
be
destroyed
hence
the
greatest
thinkers
in
the
church
generally
poured
contempt
upon
all
investigators
into
a
science
of
nature
and
insisted
that
everything
except
the
saving
of
souls
was
folly
this
belief
appears
frequently
through
the
entire
period
of
the
middle
ages
but
during
the
first
thousand
years
it
is
clearly
dominant
from
lactantius
and
eusebius
in
the
third
century
pouring
contempt
as
we
have
seen
over
studies
in
astronomy
to
peter
damian
the
noted
chancellor
of
pope
gregory
vii
in
the
eleventh
century
declaring
all
worldly
sciences
to
be
absurdities
and
fooleries
it
becomes
a
very
important
element
in
the
atmosphere
of
thought
for
the
view
of
peter
damian
and
others
through
the
middle
ages
as
to
the
futility
of
scientific
investigation
see
citations
in
eicken
geschichte
und
system

mittelalterlichen

chap
vi
then
too
there
was
established
a
standard
to
which
all
science
which
did
struggle
up
through
this
atmosphere
must
be
made
to
conform
a
standard
which
favoured
magic
rather
than
science
for
it
was
a
standard
of
rigid
dogmatism
obtained
from
literal
readings
in
the
jewish
and
christian
scriptures
the
most
careful
inductions
from
ascertained
facts
were
regarded
as
wretchedly
fallible
when
compared
with
any
view
of
nature
whatever
given
or
even
hinted
at
in
any
poem
chronicle
code
apologue
myth
legend
allegory
letter
or
discourse
of
any
sort
which
had
happened
to
be
preserved
in
the
literature
which
had
come
to
be
held
as
sacred
for
twelve
centuries
then
the
physical
sciences
were
thus
discouraged
or
perverted
by
the
dominant
orthodoxy
whoever
studied
nature
studied
it
either
openly
to
find
illustrations
of
the
sacred
text
useful
in
the
saving
of
souls
or
secretly
to
gain
the
aid
of
occult
powers
useful
in
securing
personal
advantage
great
men
like
bede
isidore
of
seville
and
rabanus
maurus
accepted
the
scriptural
standard
of
science
and
used
it
as
a
means
of
christian
edification
the
views
of
bede
and
isidore
on
kindred
subjects
have
been
shown
in
former
chapters
and
typical
of
the
view
taken
by
rabanus
is
the
fact
that
in
his
great
work
on
the
universe
there
are
only
two
chapters
which
seem
directly
or
indirectly
to
recognise
even
the
beginnings
of
a
real
philosophy
of
nature
a
multitude
of
men
found
warrant
in
scripture
for
magic
applied
to
less
worthy
purposes

after
the
thousand
years
had
passed
to
which
various
thinkers
in
the
church
upon
supposed
scriptural
warrant
had
lengthened
out
the
term
of
the
earth
existence
the
end
of
all
things
seemed
further
off
than
ever
and
in
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
owing
to
causes
which
need
not
be
dwelt
upon
here
came
a
great
revival
of
thought
so
that
the
forces
of
theology
and
of
science
seemed
arrayed
for
a
contest
on
one
side
came
a
revival
of
religious
fervour
and
to
this
day
the
works
of
the
cathedral
builders
mark
its
depth
and
strength
on
the
other
side
came
a
new
spirit
of
inquiry
incarnate
in
a
line
of
powerful
thinkers
first
among
these
was
albert
of
bollstadt
better
known
as
albert
the
great
the
most
renowned
scholar
of
his
time
fettered
though
he
was
by
the
methods
sanctioned
in
the
church
dark
as
was
all
about
him
he
had
conceived
better
methods
and
aims
his
eye
pierced
the
mists
of
scholasticism
he
saw
the
light
and
sought
to
draw
the
world
toward
it
he
stands
among
the
great
pioneers
of
physical
and
natural
science
he
aided
in
giving
foundations
to
botany
and
chemistry
he
rose
above
his
time
and
struck
a
heavy
blow
at
those
who
opposed
the
possibility
of
human
life
on
opposite
sides
of
the
earth
he
noted
the
influence
of
mountains
seas
and
forests
upon
races
and
products
so
that
humboldt
justly
finds
in
his
works
the
germs
of
physical
geography
as
a
comprehensive
science
but
the
old
system
of
deducing
scientific
truth
from
scriptural
texts
was
renewed
in
the
development
of
scholastic
theology
and
ecclesiastical
power
acting
through
thousands
of
subtle
channels
was
made
to
aid
this
development
the
old
idea
of
the
futility
of
physical
science
and
of
the
vast
superiority
of
theology
was
revived
though
albert
main
effort
was
to
christianize
science
he
was
dealt
with
by
the
authorities
of
the
dominican
order
subjected
to
suspicion
and
indignity
and
only
escaped
persecution
for
sorcery
by
yielding
to
the
ecclesiastical
spirit
of
the
time
and
working
finally
in
theological
channels
by
scholastic
methods
it
was
a
vast
loss
to
the
earth
and
certainly
of
all
organizations
that
have
reason
to
lament
the
pressure
of
ecclesiasticism
which
turned
albert
the
great
from
natural
philosophy
to
theology
foremost
of
all
in
regret
should
be
the
christian
church
and
especially
the
roman
branch
of
it
had
there
been
evolved
in
the
church
during
the
thirteenth
century
a
faith
strong
enough
to
accept
the
truths
in
natural
science
which
albert
and
his
compeers
could
have
given
and
to
have
encouraged
their
growth
this
faith
and
this
encouragement
would
to
this
day
have
formed
the
greatest
argument
for
proving
the
church
directly
under
divine
guidance
they
would
have
been
among
the
brightest
jewels
in
her
crown
the
loss
to
the
church
by
this
want
of
faith
and
courage
has
proved
in
the
long
run
even
greater
than
the
loss
to
science

the
next
great
man
of
that
age
whom
the
theological
and
ecclesiastical
forces
of
the
time
turned
from
the
right
path
was
vincent
of
beauvais
during
the
first
half
of
the
twelfth
century
he
devoted
himself
to
the
study
of
nature
in
several
of
her
most
interesting
fields
to
astronomy
botany
and
zoology
he
gave
special
attention
but
in
a
larger
way
he
made
a
general
study
of
the
universe
and
in
a
series
of
treatises
undertook
to
reveal
the
whole
field
of
science
but
his
work
simply
became
a
vast
commentary
on
the
account
of
creation
given
in
the
book
of
genesis
beginning
with
the
work
of
the
trinity
at
the
creation
he
goes
on
to
detail
the
work
of
angels
in
all
their
fields
and
makes
excursions
into
every
part
of
creation
visible
and
invisible
but
always
with
the
most
complete
subordination
of
his
thought
to
the
literal
statements
of
scripture
could
he
have
taken
the
path
of
experimental
research
the
world
would
have
been
enriched
with
most
precious
discoveries
but
the
force
which
had
given
wrong
direction
to
albert
of
bollstadt
backed
as
it
was
by
the
whole
ecclesiastical
power
of
his
time
was
too
strong
and
in
all
the
life
labour
of
vincent
nothing
appears
of
any
permanent
value
he
reared
a
structure
which
the
adaptation
of
facts
to
literal
interpretations
of
scripture
and
the
application
of
theological
subtleties
to
nature
combine
to
make
one
of
the
most
striking
monuments
of
human
error

but
the
theological
spirit
of
the
thirteenth
century
gained
its
greatest
victory
in
the
work
of
thomas
aquinas
in
him
was
the
theological
spirit
of
his
age
incarnate
although
he
yielded
somewhat
at
one
period
to
love
of
natural
science
it
was
he
who
finally
made
that
great
treaty
or
compromise
which
for
ages
subjected
science
entirely
to
theology
he
it
was
who
reared
the
most
enduring
barrier
against
those
who
in
that
age
and
in
succeeding
ages
laboured
to
open
for
science
the
path
by
its
own
methods
toward
its
own
ends
he
had
been
the
pupil
of
albert
the
great
and
had
gained
much
from
him
through
the
earlier
systems
of
philosophy
as
they
were
then
known
and
through
the
earlier
theologic
thought
he
had
gone
with
great
labour
and
vigour
and
all
his
mighty
powers
thus
disciplined
and
cultured
he
brought
to
bear
in
making
a
truce
which
was
to
give
theology
permanent
supremacy
over
science
the
experimental
method
had
already
been
practically
initiated
albert
of
bollstadt
and
roger
bacon
had
begun
their
work
in
accordance
with
its
methods
but
thomas
gave
all
his
thoughts
to
bringing
science
again
under
the
sway
of
theological
methods
and
ecclesiastical
control
in
his
commentary
on
aristotle
treatise
upon

and

he
gave
to

a

which
arise
in
combining
theological

literal

claimed
that
miracles
were
vouchsafed
proving
that
the
blessing
of
heaven
rested
upon
his
labours

among

legends
embodying
this
claim
is
that
given
by

immortalized
by

historians
of
the
roman
church
like
rohrbacher
and
historians
of
science
like
pouchet
have
found
it
convenient
to
propitiate
the
church
by
dilating
upon
the
glories
of
thomas
aquinas
in
thus
making
an
alliance
between
religious
and
scientific
thought
and
laying
the
foundations
for
a
sanctified
science
but
the
unprejudiced
historian
can
not
indulge
in
this
enthusiastic
view
the
results
both
for
the
church
and
for
science
have
been
most
unfortunate
it
was
a
wretched
delay
in
the
evolution
of
fruitful
thought
for
the
first
result
of
this
great
man
great
compromise
was
to
close
for
ages
that
path
in
science
which
above
all
others
leads
to
discoveries
of
value
the
experimental
method
and
to
reopen
that
old
path
of
mixed
theology
and
science
which

three
or
four
hundred
years
had
not
untied
a
single
knot
or
added
one
unequivocal
truth
to
the

the

the
theological
path
thus
opened
by
these
strong
men
became
the
main
path
for
science
during
ages
and
it
led
the
world
ever
further
and
further
from
any
fruitful
fact
or
useful
method
roger
investigations
already
begun
were
discredited
worthless
mixtures
of
scriptural
legends
with
imperfectly
authenticated
physical
facts
took
their
place
thus
it
was
that
for
twelve
hundred
years
the
minds
in
control
of
europe
regarded
all
real
science
as
futile
and
diverted
the
great
current
of
earnest
thought
into
theology
the
next
stage
in
this
evolution
was
the
development
of
an
idea
which
acted
with
great
force
throughout
the
middle
ages
the
idea
that
science
is
dangerous
this
belief
was
also
of
very
ancient
origin
from
the
time
when
the
egyptian
magicians
made
their
tremendous
threat
that
unless
their
demands
were
granted
they
would
reach
out
to
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
pull
down
the
pillars
of
heaven
wreck
the
abodes
of
the
gods
above
and
crush
those
of
men
below
fear
of
these
representatives
of
science
is
evident
in
the
ancient
world
but
differences
in
the
character
of
magic
were
recognised
some
sorts
being
considered
useful
and
some
baleful
of
the
former
was
magic
used
in
curing
diseases
in
determining
times
auspicious
for
enterprises
and
even
in
contributing
to
amusement
of
the
latter
was
magic
used
to
bring
disease
and
death
on
men
and
animals
or
tempests
upon
the
growing
crops
hence
gradually
arose
a
general
distinction
between
white
magic
which
dealt
openly
with
the
more
beneficent
means
of
nature
and
black
magic
which
dealt
secretly
with
occult
malignant
powers
down
to
the
christian
era
the
fear
of
magic
rarely
led
to
any
persecution
very
systematic
or
very
cruel
while
in
greece
and
rome
laws
were
at
times
enacted
against
magicians
they
were
only
occasionally
enforced
with
rigour
and
finally
toward
the
end
of
the
pagan
empire
the
feeling
against
them
seemed
dying
out
altogether
as
to
its
more
kindly
phases
men
like
marcus
aurelius
and
julian
did
not
hesitate
to
consult
those
who
claimed
to
foretell
the
future
as
to
black
magic
it
seemed
hardly
worth
while
to
enact
severe
laws
when
charms
amulets
and
even
gestures
could
thwart
its
worst
machinations
moreover
under
the
old
empire
a
real
science
was
coming
in
and
thought
was
progressing
both
the
theory
and
practice
of
magic
were
more
and
more
held
up
to
ridicule
even
as
early
a
writer
as
ennius
ridiculed
the
idea
that
magicians
who
were
generally
poor
and
hungry
themselves
could
bestow
wealth
on
others
pliny
in
his
natural
philosophy
showed
at
great
length
their
absurdities
and
cheatery
others
followed
in
the
same
line
of
thought
and
the
whole
theory
except
among
the
very
lowest
classes
seemed
dying
out
but
with
the
development
of
christian
theology
came
a
change
the
idea
of
the
active
interference
of
satan
in
magic
which
had
come
into
the
hebrew
mind
with
especial
force
from
persia
during
the
captivity
of
israel
had
passed
from
the
hebrew
scriptures
into
christianity
and
had
been
made
still
stronger
by
various
statements
in
the
new
testament
theologians
laid
stress
especially
upon
the
famous
utterances
of
the
psalmist
that
all
the
gods
of
the
heathen
are
devils
and
of
paul
that
the
things
which
the
gentiles
sacrifice
they
sacrifice
to
devils
and
it
was
widely
held
that
these
devils
were
naturally
indignant
at
their
dethronement
and
anxious
to
wreak
vengeance
upon
christianity
magicians
were
held
to
be
active
agents
of
these
dethroned
gods
and
this
persuasion
was
strengthened
by
sundry
old
practitioners
in
the
art
of
magic
impostors
who
pretended
to
supernatural
powers
and
who
made
use
of
old
rites
and
phrases
inherited
from
paganism
hence
it
was
that
as
soon
as
christianity
came
into
power
it
more
than
renewed
the
old
severities
against
the
forbidden
art
and
one
of
the
first
acts
of
the
emperor
constantine
after
his
conversion
was
to
enact
a
most
severe
law
against
magic
and
magicians
under
which
the
main
offender
might
be
burned
alive
but
here
too
it
should
be
noted
that
a
distinction
between
the
two
sorts
of
magic
was
recognised
for
constantine
shortly
afterward
found
it
necessary
to
issue
a
proclamation
stating
that
his
intention
was
only
to
prohibit
deadly
and
malignant
magic
that
he
had
no
intention
of
prohibiting
magic
used
to
cure
diseases
and
to
protect
the
crops
from
hail
and
tempests
but
as
new
emperors
came
to
the
throne
who
had
not
in
them
that
old
leaven
of
paganism
which
to
the
last
influenced
constantine
and
as
theology
obtained
a
firmer
hold
severity
against
magic
increased
toleration
of
it
even
in
its
milder
forms
was
more
and
more
denied
black
magic
and
white
were
classed
together
this
severity
went
on
increasing
and
threatened
the
simplest
efforts
in
physics
and
chemistry
even
the
science
of
mathematics
was
looked
upon
with
dread
by
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
the
older
theology
having
arrived
at
the
climax
of
its
development
in
europe
terror
of
magic
and
witchcraft
took
complete
possession
of
the
popular
mind
in
sculpture
painting
and
literature
it
appeared
in
forms
ever
more
and
more
striking
the
lives
of
saints
were
filled
with
it
the
cathedral
sculpture
embodied
it
in
every
part
the
storied
windows
made
it
all
the
more
impressive
the
missal
painters
wrought
it
not
only
into
prayer
books
but
despite
the
fact
that
hardly
a
trace
of
the
belief
appears
in
the
psalms
they
illustrated
it
in
the
great
illuminated
psalters
from
which
the
noblest
part
of
the
service
was
sung
before
the
high
altar
the
service
books
showed
every
form
of
agonizing
petition
for
delivery
from
this
dire
influence
and
every
form
of
exorcism
for
thwarting
it
all
the
great
theologians
of
the
church
entered
into
this
belief
and
aided
to
develop
it
the
fathers
of
the
early
church
were
full
and
explicit
and
the
medieval
doctors
became
more
and
more
minute
in
describing
the
operations
of
the
black
art
and
in
denouncing
them
it
was
argued
that
as
the
devil
afflicted
job
so
he
and
his
minions
continue
to
cause
diseases
that
as
satan
is
the
prince
of
the
power
of
the
air
he
and
his
minions
cause
tempests
that
the
cases
of
nebuchadnezzar
and
lot
wife
prove
that
sorcerers
can
transform
human
beings
into
animals
or
even
lifeless
matter
that
as
the
devils
of
gadara
were
cast
into
swine
all
animals
could
be
afflicted
in
the
same
manner
and
that
as
christ
himself
had
been
transported
through
the
air
by
the
power
of
satan
so
any
human
being
might
be
thus
transported
to
an
exceeding
high
mountain
thus
the
horror
of
magic
and
witchcraft
increased
on
every
hand
and
in
pope
john
xxii
issued
his
bull
spondent
pariter
levelled
at
the
alchemists
but
really
dealing
a
terrible
blow
at
the
beginnings
of
chemical
science
that
many
alchemists
were
knavish
is
no
doubt
true
but
no
infallibility
in
separating
the
evil
from
the
good
was
shown
by
the
papacy
in
this
matter
in
this
and
in
sundry
other
bulls
and
briefs
we
find
pope
john
by
virtue
of
his
infallibility
as
the
instructor
in
all
that
pertains
to
faith
and
morals
condemning
real
science
and
alike
in
two
of
these
documents
supposed
to
be
inspired
by
wisdom
from
on
high
he
complains
that
both
he
and
his
flock
are
in
danger
of
their
lives
by
the
arts
of
the
sorcerers
he
declares
that
such
sorcerers
can
send
devils
into
mirrors
and
finger
rings
and
kill
men
and
women
by
a
magic
word
that
they
had
tried
to
kill
him
by
piercing
a
waxen
image
of
him
with
needles
in
the
name
of
the
devil
he
therefore
called
on
all
rulers
secular
and
ecclesiastical
to
hunt
down
the
miscreants
who
thus
afflicted
the
faithful
and
he
especially
increased
the
powers
of
inquisitors
in
various
parts
of
europe
for
this
purpose
the
impulse
thus
given
to
childish
fear
and
hatred
against
the
investigation
of
nature
was
felt
for
centuries
more
and
more
chemistry
came
to
be
known
as
one
of
the
seven
devilish
arts
thus
began
a
long
series
of
demonstrations
against
magic
from
the
centre
of
christendom
in
and
again
in
pope
eugene
iv
issued
bulls
exhorting
inquisitors
to
be
more
diligent
in
searching
out
and
delivering
over
to
punishment
magicians
and
witches
who
produced
bad
weather
the
result
being
that
persecution
received
a
fearful
impulse
but
the
worst
came
forty
years
later
still
when
in
there
came
the
yet
more
terrible
bull
of
pope
innocent
viii
known
as
summis
desiderantes
which
let
inquisitors
loose
upon
germany
with
sprenger
at
their
head
armed
with
the
the
fearful
manual
malleus
maleficarum
to
torture
and
destroy
men
and
women
by
tens
of
thousands
for
sorcery
and
magic
similar
bulls
were
issued
in
by
julius
ii
and
in
by
adrian
vi
the
system
of
repression
thus
begun
lasted
for
hundreds
of
years
the
reformation
did
little
to
change
it
and
in
germany
where
catholics
and
protestants
vied
with
each
other
in
proving
their
orthodoxy
it
was
at
its
worst
on
german
soil
more
than
one
hundred
thousand
victims
are
believed
to
have
been
sacrificed
to
it
between
the
middle
of
the
fifteenth
and
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
centuries
thus
it
was
that
from
augustine
to
thomas
aquinas
from
aquinas
to
luther
and
from
luther
to
wesley
theologians
of
both
branches
of
the
church
with
hardly
an
exception
enforced
the
belief
in
magic
and
witchcraft
and
as
far
as
they
had
power
carried
out
the
injunction
thou
shalt
not
suffer
a
witch
to
live
how
this
was
ended
by
the
progress
of
scientific
modes
of
thought
i
shall
endeavour
to
show
elsewhere
here
we
are
only
concerned
with
the
effect
of
this
widespread
terrorism
on
the
germs
and
early
growth
of
the
physical
sciences
of
course
the
atmosphere
created
by
this
persecution
of
magicians
was
deadly
to
any
open
beginnings
of
experimental
science
the
conscience
of
the
time
acting
in
obedience
to
the
highest
authorities
of
the
church
and
as
was
supposed
in
defence
of
religion
now
brought
out
a
missile
which
it
hurled
against
scientific
investigators
with
deadly
effect
the
mediaeval
battlefields
of
thought
were
strewn
with
various
forms
of
it
this
missile
was
the
charge
of
unlawful
compact
with
satan
and
it
was
most
effective
we
find
it
used
against
every
great
investigator
of
nature
in
those
times
and
for
ages
after
the
list
of
great
men
in
those
centuries
charged
with
magic
as
given
by
naude
is
astounding
it
includes
every
man
of
real
mark
and
in
the
midst
of
them
stands
one
of
the
most
thoughtful
popes
sylvester
ii
gerbert
and
the
foremost
of
mediaeval
thinkers
on
natural
science
albert
the
great
it
came
to
be
the
accepted
idea
that
as
soon
as
a
man
conceived
a
wish
to
study
the
works
of
god
his
first
step
must
be
a
league
with
the
devil
it
was
entirely
natural
then
that
in
pope
alexander
iii
in
connection
with
the
council
of
tours
forbade
the
study
of
physics
to
all
ecclesiastics
which
of
course
in
that
age
meant
prohibition
of
all
such
scientific
studies
to
the
only
persons
likely
to
make
them
what
the
pope
then
expressly
forbade
was
in
the
words
of
the
papal
bull
the
study
of
physics
or
the
laws
of
the
world
and
it
was
added
that
any
person
violating
this
rule
shall
be
avoided
by
all
and
excommunicated
for
the
charge
of
magic

steadily
approaches
him
in
brightness
more
than
three
centuries
before
francis
bacon
advocated
the
experimental
method
roger
bacon
practised
it
and
the
results
as
now
revealed
are
wonderful
he
wrought
with
power
in
many
sciences
and
his
knowledge
was
sound
and
exact
by
him
more
than
by
any
other
man
of
the
middle
ages
was
the
world
brought
into
the
more
fruitful
paths
of
scientific
thought
the
paths
which
have
led
to
the
most
precious
inventions
and
among
these
are
clocks
lenses
and
burning
specula
which
were
given
by
him
to
the
world
directly
or
indirectly
in
his
writings
are
found
formulae
for
extracting
phosphorus
manganese
and
bismuth
it
is
even
claimed
with
much
appearance
of
justice
that
he
investigated
the
power
of
steam
and
he
seems
to
have
very
nearly
reached
some
of
the
principal
doctrines
of
modern
chemistry
but
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
his
method
of
investigation
was
even
greater
than
its
results
in
an
age
when
theological
subtilizing
was
alone
thought
to
give
the
title
of
scholar
he
insisted
on
real
reasoning
and
the
aid
of
natural
science
by
mathematics
in
an
age
when
experimenting
was
sure
to
cost
a
man
his
reputation
and
was
likely
to
cost
him
his
life
he
insisted
on
experimenting
and
braved
all
its
risks
few
greater
men
have
lived
as
we
follow
bacon
process
of
reasoning
regarding
the
refraction
of
light
we
see
that
he
was
divinely
inspired
on
this
man
came
the
brunt
of
the
battle
the
most
conscientious
men
of
his
time
thought
it
their
duty
to
fight
him
and
they
fought
him
steadily
and
bitterly
his
sin
was
not
disbelief
in
christianity
not
want
of
fidelity
to
the
church
not
even
dissent
from
the
main
lines
of
orthodoxy
on
the
contrary
he
showed
in
all
his
writings
a
desire
to
strengthen
christianity
to
build
up
the
church
and
to
develop
orthodoxy
he
was
attacked
and
condemned
mainly
because
he
did
not
believe
that
philosophy
had
become
complete
and
that
nothing
more
was
to
be
learned
he
was
condemned
as
his
opponents
expressly
declared
on
account
of
certain
suspicious
novelties
propter
quasdam
novitates
suspectas
upon
his
return
to
oxford
about
the
forces
of
unreason
beset
him
on
all
sides
greatest
of
all
his
enemies
was
bonaventura
this
enemy
was
the
theologic
idol
of
the
period
the
learned
world
knew
him
as
the
seraphic
doctor
dante
gave
him
an
honoured
place
in
the
great
poem
of
the
middle
ages
the
church
finally
enrolled
him
among
the
saints
by
force
of
great
ability
in
theology
he
had
become
in
the
middle
of
the
thirteenth
century
general
of
the
franciscan
order
thus
as
master
his
hands
were
laid
heavily
on
the
new
teaching
so
that
in
the
troublesome
monk
was
forbidden
to
lecture
all
men
were
solemnly
warned
not
to
listen
to
his
teaching
and
he
was
ordered
to
paris
to
be
kept
under
surveillance
by
the
monastic
authorities
herein
was
exhibited
another
of
the
myriad
examples
showing
the
care
exercised
over
scientific
teaching
by
the
church
the
reasons
for
thus
dealing
with
bacon
were
evident
first
he
had
dared
attempt
scientific
explanations
of
natural
phenomena
which
under
the
mystic
theology
of
the
middle
ages
had
been
referred
simply
to
supernatural
causes
typical
was
his
explanation
of
the
causes
and
character
of
the
rainbow
it
was
clear
cogent
a
great
step
in
the
right
direction
as
regards
physical
science
but
there
in
the
book
of
genesis
stood
the
legend
regarding
the
origin
of
the
rainbow
supposed
to
have
been
dictated
immediately
by
the
holy
spirit
and
according
to
that
the
bow
in
the
cloud
was
not
the
result
of
natural
laws
but
a
sign
arbitrarily
placed
in
the
heavens
for
the
simple
purpose
of
assuring
mankind
that
there
was
not
to
be
another
universal
deluge
but
this
was
not
the
worst
another
theological
idea
was
arrayed
against
him
the
idea
of
satanic
intervention
in
science
hence
he
was
attacked
with
that
goodly
missile
which
with
the
epithets
infidel
and
atheist
has
decided
the
fate
of
so
many
battles
the
charge
of
magic
and
compact
with
satan
he
defended
himself
with
a
most
unfortunate
weapon
a
weapon
which
exploded
in
his
hands
and
injured
him
more
than
the
enemy
for
he
argued
against
the
idea
of
compacts
with
satan
and
showed
that
much
which
is
ascribed
to
demons
results
from
natural
means
this
added
fuel
to
the
flame
to
limit
the
power
of
satan
was
deemed
hardly
less
impious
than
to
limit
the
power
of
god
the
most
powerful
protectors
availed
him
little
his
friend
guy
of
foulques
having
in
been
made
pope
under
the
name
of
clement
iv
shielded
him
for
a
time
but
the
fury
of
the
enemy
was
too
strong
and
when
he
made
ready
to
perform
a
few
experiments
before
a
small
audience
we
are
told
that
all
oxford
was
in
an
uproar
it
was
believed
that
satan
was
about
to
be
let
loose
everywhere
priests
monks
fellows
and
students
rushed
about
their
garments
streaming
in
the
wind
and
everywhere
rose
the
cry
down
with
the
magician
and
this
cry
down
with
the
magician
resounded
from
cell
to
cell
and
from
hall
to
hall
another
weapon
was
also
used
upon
the
battlefields
of
science
in
that
time
with
much
effect
the
arabs
had
made
many
noble
discoveries
in
science
and
averroes
had
in
the
opinion
of
many
divided
the
honours
with
thomas
aquinas
these
facts
gave
the
new
missile
it
was
the
epithet
mohammedan
this
too
was
flung
with
effect
at
bacon
the
attack
now
began
to
take
its
final
shape
the
two
great
religious
orders
franciscan
and
dominican
then
in
all
the
vigour
of
their
youth
vied
with
each
other
in
fighting
the
new
thought
in
chemistry
and
physics
dominic
solemnly
condemned
research
by
experiment
and
observation
the
general
of
the
franciscan
order
took
similar
ground
in
the
dominicans
interdicted
every
member
of
their
order
from
the
study
of
medicine
and
natural
philosophy
and
in
this
interdiction
was
extended
to
the
study
of
chemistry
in
the
authorities
of
the
franciscan
order
assembled
at
paris
solemnly
condemned
bacon
teaching
and
the
general
of
the
franciscans
jerome
of
ascoli
afterward
pope
threw
him
into
prison
where
he
remained
for
fourteen
years
though
pope
clement
iv
had
protected
him
popes
nicholas
iii
and
iv
by
virtue
of
their
infallibility
decided
that
he
was
too
dangerous
to
be
at
large
and
he
was
only
released
at
the
age
of
eighty
but
a
year
or
two
before
death
placed
him
beyond
the
reach
of
his
enemies
how
deeply
the
struggle
had
racked
his
mind
may
be
gathered
from
that
last
affecting
declaration
of
his
would
that
i
had
not
given
myself
so
much
trouble
for
the
love
of
science
the
attempt
has
been
made
by
sundry
champions
of
the
church
to
show
that
some
of
bacon
utterances
against
ecclesiastical
and
other
corruptions
in
his
time
were
the
main
cause
of
the
severity
which
the
church
authorities
exercised
against
him
this
helps
the
church
but
little
even
if
it
be
well
based
but
it
is
not
well
based
that
some
of
his
utterances
of
this
sort
made
him
enemies
is
doubtless
true
but
the
charges
on
which
bonaventura
silenced
him
and
jerome
of
ascoli
imprisoned
him
and
successive
popes
kept
him
in
prison
for
fourteen
years
were
dangerous
novelties
and
suspected
sorcery
sad
is
it
to
think
of
what
this
great
man
might
have
given
to
the
world
had
ecclesiasticism
allowed
the
gift
he
held
the
key
of
treasures
which
would
have
freed
mankind
from
ages
of
error
and
misery
with
his
discoveries
as
a
basis
with
his
method
as
a
guide
what
might
not
the
world
have
gained
nor
was
the
wrong
done
to
that
age
alone
it
was
done
to
this
age
also
the
nineteenth
century
was
robbed
at
the
same
time
with
the
thirteenth
but
for
that
interference
with
science
the
nineteenth
century
would
be
enjoying
discoveries
which
will
not
be
reached
before
the
twentieth
century
and
even
later
thousands
of
precious
lives
shall
be
lost
tens
of
thousands
shall
suffer
discomfort
privation
sickness
poverty
ignorance
for
lack
of
discoveries
and
methods
which
but
for
this
mistaken
dealing
with
roger
bacon
and
his
compeers
would
now
be
blessing
the
earth
in
two
recent
years
sixty
thousand
children
died
in
england
and
in
wales
of
scarlet
fever
probably
quite
as
many
died
in
the
united
states
had
not
bacon
been
hindered
we
should
have
had
in
our
hands
by
this
time
the
means
to
save
two
thirds
of
these
victims
and
the
same
is
true
of
typhoid
typhus
cholera
and
that
great
class
of
diseases
of
whose
physical
causes
science
is
just
beginning
to
get
an
inkling
put
together
all
the
efforts
of
all
the
atheists
who
have
ever
lived
and
they
have
not
done
so
much
harm
to
christianity
and
the
world
as
has
been
done
by
the
conscientious
men
who
persecuted
roger
bacon
and
closed
the
path
which
he
gave
his
life
to
open
but
despite
the
persecution
of
bacon
and
the
defection
of
those
who
ought
to
have
followed
him
champions
of
the
experimental
method
rose
from
time
to
time
during
the
succeeding
centuries
we
know
little
of
them
personally
our
main
knowledge
of
their
efforts
is
derived
from
the
endeavours
of
their
persecutors
under
such
guidance
the
secular
rulers
were
naturally
vigorous
in
france
charles
v
forbade
in
the
possession
of
furnaces
and
apparatus
necessary
for
chemical
processes
under
this
law
the
chemist
john
barrillon
was
thrown
into
prison
and
it
was
only
by
the
greatest
effort
that
his
life
was
saved
in
england
henry
iv
in
issued
a
similar
decree
in
italy
the
republic
of
venice
in
followed
these
examples
the
judicial
torture
and
murder
of
antonio
de
dominis
were
not
simply
for
heresy
his
investigations
in
the
phenomena
of
light
were
an
additional
crime
in
spain
everything
like
scientific
research
was
crushed
out
among
christians
some
earnest
efforts
were
afterward
made
by
jews
and
moors
but
these
were
finally
ended
by
persecution
and
to
this
hour
the
spanish
race
in
some
respects
the
most
gifted
in
europe
which
began
its
career
with
everything
in
its
favour
and
with
every
form
of
noble
achievement
remains
in
intellectual
development
behind
every
other
in
christendom
to
question
the
theological
view
of
physical
science
was
even
long
after
the
close
of
the
middle
ages
exceedingly
perilous
we
have
seen
how
one
of
roger
bacon
unpardonable
offences
was
his
argument
against
the
efficacy
of
magic
and
how
centuries
afterward
cornelius
agrippa
weyer
flade
loos
bekker

a

of
thinking
men
under

they
could
secure
still
persisted
in
devoting
themselves

the
physical
sciences

italy
in
the

half
of
the
sixteenth
century
came
a
striking
example
of
the
difficulties
which
science
still
encountered
even
after

renaissance

undermined

old
beliefs
at

john
baptist

conducting

they
were
fruitful
his
was
not
black
magic
claiming
the
aid
of
satan
but
white
magic
bringing
into
service
the
laws
of
nature
the
precursor
of
applied
science
his
book
on
meteorology
was
the
first
in
which
sound
ideas
were
broached
on
this
subject
his
researches
in
optics
gave
the
world
the
camera
obscura
and
possibly
the
telescope
in
chemistry
he
seems
to
have
been
the
first
to
show
how
to
reduce
the
metallic
oxides
and
thus
to
have
laid
the
foundation
of
several
important
industries
he
did
much
to
change
natural
philosophy
from
a
black
art
to
a
vigorous
open
science
he
encountered
the
old
ecclesiastical
policy
the
society
founded
by
him
for
physical
research
i
secreti
was
broken
up
and
he
was
summoned
to
rome
by
pope
paul
iii
and
forbidden
to
continue
his
investigations
so
too
in
france
in
some
young
chemists

taught
the
experimental
method
and
cut

from
aristotle
the
faculty
of
theology
beset
the
parliament
of
paris
and
the
parliament
prohibited
these
new
chemical
researches
under
the
severest
penalties
the
same
war
continued
in
italy
even
after
the
belief
in
magic
had
been
seriously
weakened
the
old
theological
fear
and
dislike
of

a
hostility
similar
in
kind
though
less
in
degree
was
shown
in
protestant
countries
even
after
thomasius
in
germany
and
voltaire
in
france
and
beccaria
in
italy
had
given
final
blows
to
the
belief
in
magic
and
witchcraft
throughout
christendom
the
traditional
orthodox
distrust
of
the
physical
sciences
continued
for
a
long
time
in
england
a
marked
dislike
was
shown
among
various
leading
ecclesiastics
and
theologians
towards
the
royal
society
and
later
toward
the
association
for
the
advancement
of
science
and
this
dislike
as
will
hereafter
be
seen
sometimes
took
shape
in
serious
opposition
as
a
rule
both
in
protestant
and
catholic
countries
instruction
in
chemistry
and
physics
was
for
a
long
time
discouraged
by
church
authorities
and
when
its
suppression
was
no
longer
possible
great
pains
were
taken
to
subordinate
it
to
instruction
supposed
to
be
more
fully
in
accordance
with
the
older
methods
of
theological
reasoning
i
have
now
presented
in
outline
the
more
direct
and
open
struggle
of
the
physical
sciences
with
theology
mainly
as
an
exterior
foe
we
will
next
consider
their
warfare
with
the
same
foe
in
its
more
subtle
form
mainly
as
a
vitiating
and
sterilizing
principle
in
science
itself
we
have
seen
thus
far
first
how
such
men
as
eusebius
lactantius
and
their
compeers
opposed
scientific
investigation
as
futile
next
how
such
men
as
albert
the
great
thomas
aquinas
and
the
multitude
who
followed
them
turned
the
main
current
of
medieval
thought
from
science
to
theology
and
finally
how
a
long
line
of
church
authorities
from
popes
john
xxii
and
innocent
viii
and
the
heads
of
the
great
religious
orders
down
to
various
theologians
and
ecclesiastics
catholic
and
protestant
of
a
very
recent
period
endeavoured
first
to
crush
and
afterward
to
discourage
scientific
research
as
dangerous
yet
injurious
as
all
this
was
to
the
evolution
of
science
there
was
developed
something
in
many
respects
more
destructive
and
this
was
the
influence
of
mystic
theology
penetrating
permeating
vitiating
sterilizing
nearly
every
branch
of
science
for
hundreds
of
years
among
the
forms
taken
by
this
development
in
the
earlier
middle
ages
we
find
a
mixture
of
physical
science
with
a
obtained
from
texts
of
scripture
in
compounding
this
mixture
jews
and
christians
vied
with
each
other
in
this
process
the
sacred
books
were
used
as
a
fetich
every
word
every
letter
being
considered
to
have
a
divine
and
hidden
meaning
by
combining
various
scriptural
letters
in
various
abstruse
ways
new
words
of
prodigious
significance
in
magic
were
obtained
and
among
them
the
great
word
embracing
the
mystical
names
of
god
the
mighty
word
schemhamphoras
why
should
men
seek
knowledge
by
observation
and
experiment
in
the
book
of
nature
when
the
book
of
revelation
interpreted
by
the
kabbalah
opened
such
treasures
to
the
ingenious
believer
so
too
we
have
ancient
mystical
theories
of
number
which
the
theological
spirit
had
made
christian
usurping
an
enormous
place
in
medieval
science
the
sacred
power
of
the
number
three
was
seen
in
the
trinity
in
the
three
main
divisions
of
the
universe
the
empyrean
the
heavens
and
the
earth
in
the
three
angelic
hierarchies
in
the
three
choirs
of
seraphim
cherubim
and
thrones
in
the
three
of
dominions
virtues
and
powers
in
the
three
of
principalities
archangels
and
angels
in
the
three
orders
in
the
church
bishops
priests
and
deacons
in
the
three
classes
the
baptized
the
communicants
and
the
monks
in
the
three
degrees
of
attainment
light
purity
and
knowledge
in
the
three
theological
virtues
faith
hope
and
charity
and
in
much
else
all
this
was
brought
into
a
relation
then
and
afterward
with
the
three
dimensions
of
space
with
the
three
divisions
of
time
past
present
and
future
with
the
three
realms
of
the
visible
world
sky
earth
and
sea
with
the
three
constituents
of
man
body
soul
and
spirit
with
the
threefold
enemies
of
man
the
world
the
flesh
and
the
devil
with
the
three
kingdoms
in
nature
mineral
vegetable
and
animal
with
the
three
colours
red
yellow
and
blue
with
the
three
eyes
of
the
and
with
a
multitude
of
other
analogues
equally
precious
the
sacred
power
of
the
number
seven
was
seen
in
the
seven
golden
candlesticks
and
the
seven
churches
in
the
apocalypse
in
the
seven
cardinal
virtues
and
the
seven
deadly
sins
in
the
seven
liberal
arts
and
the
seven
devilish
arts
and
above
all
in
the
seven
sacraments
and
as
this
proved
in
astrology
that
there
could
be
only
seven
planets
so
it
proved
in
alchemy
that
there
must
be
exactly
seven
metals
the
twelve
apostles
were
connected
with
the
twelve
signs
in
the
zodiac
and
with
much
in
physical
science
the
disciples
the
interpreters
of
the
old
testament
the
mystical
names
of
god
were
connected
with
the
alleged
fact
in
anatomy
that
there
were
joints
in
the
human
frame
then
also
there
were
revived
such
theologic
and
metaphysical
substitutes
for
scientific
thought
as
the
declaration
that
the
perfect
line
is
a
circle
and
hence
that
the
planets
must
move
in
absolute
circles
a
statement
which
led
astronomy
astray
even
when
the
great
truths
of
the
copernican
theory
were
well
in
sight
also
the
declaration
that
nature
abhors
a
vacuum
a
statement
which
led
physics
astray
until
torricelli
made
his
experiments
also
the
declaration
that
we
see
the
lightning
before
we
hear
the
thunder
because
sight
is
nobler
than
hearing
in
chemistry
we
have
the
same
theologic
tendency
to
magic
and
as
a
result
a
muddle
of
science
and
theology
which
from
one
point
of
view
seems
blasphemous
and
from
another
idiotic
but
which
none
the
less
sterilized
physical
investigation
for
ages
that
debased
platonism
which
had
been
such
an
important
factor
in
the
evolution
of
christian
theology
from
the
earliest
days
of
the
church
continued
its
work
as
everything
in
inorganic
nature
was
supposed
to
have
spiritual
significance
the
doctrines
of
the
trinity
and
incarnation
were
turned
into
an
argument
in
behalf
of
the
philosopher
stone
arguments
for
the
scheme
of
redemption
and
for
transubstantiation
suggested
others
of
similar
construction
to
prove
the
transmutation
of
metals
the
doctrine
of
the
resurrection
of
the
human
body
was
by
similar
mystic
jugglery
connected
with
the
processes
of
distillation
and
sublimation
even
after
the
middle
ages
were
past
strong
men
seemed
unable
to
break
away
from
such
reasoning
as
this
among
them
such
leaders
as
basil
valentine
in
the
fifteenth
century
agricola
in
the
sixteenth
and
van
helmont
in
the
seventeenth
the
greatest
theologians
contributed
to
the
welter
of
unreason
from
which
this
was
developed
one
question
largely
discussed
was
whether
at
the
redemption
it
was
necessary
for
god
to
take
the
human
form
thomas
aquinas
answered
that
it
was
necessary
but
william
occam
and
duns
scotus
answered
that
it
was
not
that
god
might
have
taken
the
form
of
a
stone
or
of
a
log
or
of
a
beast
the
possibilities
opened
to
wild
substitutes
for
science
by
this
sort
of
reasoning
were
infinite
men
have
often
asked
how
it
was
that
the
arabians
accomplished
so
much
in
scientific
discovery
as
compared
with
christian
investigators
but
the
answer
is
easy
the
arabians
were
comparatively
free
from
these
theologic
allurements
which
in
christian
europe
flickered
in
the
air
on
all
sides
luring
men
into
paths
which
led
strong
investigators
like
arnold
of
villanova
raymond
lully
basil
valentine
paracelsus
and
their
compeers
were
thus
drawn
far
out
of
the
only
paths
which
led
to
fruitful
truths
in
a
work
generally
ascribed
to
the
first
of
these
the
student
is
told
that
in
mixing
his
chemicals
he
must
repeat
the
psalm
exsurge
domine
and
that
on
certain
chemical
vessels
must
be
placed
the
last
words
of
jesus
on
the
cross
vincent
of
beauvais
insisted
that
as
the
bible
declares
that
noah
when
five
hundred
years
old
had
children
born
to
him
he
must
have
possessed
alchemical
means
of
preserving
life
and
much
later
dickinson
insisted
that
the
patriarchs
generally
must
have
owed
their
long
lives
to
such
means
it
was
loudly
declared
that
the
reality
of
the
stone
was
proved
by
the
words
of
john
in
the
revelation
to
him
that
overcometh
i
will
give
a
white
stone
the
reasonableness
of
seeking
to
develop
gold
out
of
the
baser
metals
was
for
many
generations
based
upon
the
doctrine
of
the
resurrection
of
the
physical
body
which
though
explicitly
denied
by
paul
had
become
a
part
of
the
creed
of
the
church
martin
luther
was
especially
drawn
to
believe
in
the
alchemistic
doctrine
of
transmutation
by
this
analogy
the
bible
was
everywhere
used
both
among
protestants
and
catholics
in
support
of
these
mystic
adulterations
of
science
and
one
writer
as
late
as
based
his
alchemistic
arguments
on
more
than
a
hundred
passages
of
scripture
as
an
example
of
this
sort
of
reasoning
we
have
a
proof
that
the
elect
will
preserve
the
philosopher
stone
until
the
last
judgment
drawn
from
a
passage
in
paul
epistle
to
the
corinthians
we
have
this
treasure
in
earthen
vessels
the
greatest
thinkers
devoted
themselves
to
adding
new
ingredients
to
this
strange
mixture
of
scientific
and
theologic
thought
the
catholic
philosophy
of
thomas
aquinas
the
protestant
mysticism
of
jacob
boehme
and
the
alchemistic
reveries
of
basil
valentine
were
all
cast
into
this
seething
mass
and
when
alchemy
in
its
old
form
had
been
discredited
we
find
scriptural
arguments
no
less
perverse
and
even
comical
used
on
the
other
side
as
an
example
of
this
just
before
the
great
discoveries
by
stahl
we
find
the
valuable
scientific
efforts
of
becher
opposed
with
the
following
syllogism
king
solomon
according
to
the
scriptures
possessed
the
united
wisdom
of
heaven
and
earth
but
king
solomon
knew
nothing
about
alchemy
or
chemistry
in
the
form
it
then
took
and
sent
his
vessels
to
ophir
to
seek
gold
and
levied
taxes
upon
his
subjects
ergo
alchemy
or
chemistry
has
no
reality
or
truth
and
we
find
that
becher
is
absolutely
turned
away
from
his
labours
and
obliged
to
devote
himself
to
proving
that
solomon
used
more
money
than
he
possibly
could
have
obtained
from
ophir
or
his
subjects
and
therefore
that
he
must
have
possessed

knowledge

chemical
methods

two
and
these

they

this

ideas
took
hold

the
strongest
supporters

of
these

which
embittered
the
last
years
of
his
life
and
tortured
him
upon
his
deathbed
during
his
career
at
the
university
of
wittenberg
he
gave
a
course
of
lectures
on
physics
and
in
these
he
dwelt
upon
scriptural
texts
as
affording
scientific
proofs
accepted
the
interference
of
the
devil
in
physical
phenomena
as
in
other
things
and
applied
the
medieval
method
throughout
his
whole
work
for
melanchthon
ideas
on
physics

and
also
in
vol
xiii
of

edition
of
the

and
especially
pp
yet
far
more
remarkable
was
the
example
a
century
later
of
the
man
who
more
than
any
other
led
the
world
out
of
the
path
opened
by
aquinas
and
into
that
through
which
modern
thought
has
advanced
to
its
greatest
conquests
strange
as
it
may
at
first
seem
francis
bacon
whose
keenness
of
sight
revealed
the
delusions
of
the
old
path
and
the
promises
of
the
new
and
whose
boldness
did
so
much
to
turn
the
world
from
the
old
path
into
the
new
presents
in
his
own
writings
one
of
the
most
striking
examples
of
the
evil
he
did
so
much
to
destroy
the
novum
organon
considering
the
time
when
it
came
from
his
pen
is
doubtless
one
of
the
greatest
exhibitions
of
genius
in
the
history
of
human
thought
it
showed
the
modern
world
the
way
out
of
the
scholastic
method
and
reverence
for
dogma
into
the
experimental
method
and
reverence
for
fact
in
it
occur
many
passages
which
show
that
the
great
philosopher
was
fully
alive
to
the
danger
both
to
religion
and
to
science
arising
from
their
mixture
he
declares
that
the
corruption
of
philosophy
from
superstition
and
theology
introduced
the
greatest
amount
of
evil
both
into
whole
systems
of
philosophy
and
into
their
parts
he
denounces
those
who
have
endeavoured
to
found
a
natural
philosophy
on
the
books
of
genesis
and
job
and
other
sacred
scriptures
so
the
dead
among
the
living
he
speaks
of
the
result
as
an
unwholesome
mixture
of
things
human
and
divine
not
merely
fantastic
philosophy
but
heretical
religion
he
refers
to
the
opposition
of
the
fathers
to
the
doctrine
of
the
rotundity
of
the
earth
and
says
that
thanks
to
some
of
them
you
may
find
the
approach
to
any
kind
of
philosophy
however
improved
entirely
closed
up
he
charges
that
some
of
these
divines
are
afraid
lest
perhaps
a
deeper
inquiry
into
nature
should
penetrate
beyond
the
allowed
limits
of
sobriety
and
finally
speaks
of
theologians
as
sometimes
craftily
conjecturing
that
if
science
be
little
understood
each
single
thing
can
be
referred
more
easily
to
the
hand
and
rod
of
god
and
says
this
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
wishing
to
please
god
by
a
lie
no
man
who
has
reflected
much
upon
the
annals
of
his
race
can
without
a
feeling
of
awe
come
into
the
presence
of
such
clearness
of
insight
and
boldness
of
utterance
and
the
first
thought
of
the
reader
is
that
of
all
men
francis
bacon
is
the
most
free
from
the
unfortunate
bias
he
condemns
that
he
certainly
can
not
be
deluded
into
the
old
path
but
as
we
go
on
through
his
main
work
we
are
surprised
to
find
that
the
strong
arm
of
aquinas
has
been
stretched
over
the
intervening
ages
and
has
laid
hold
upon
this
of
the
seventeenth
century
for
only
a
few
chapters
beyond
those
containing
the
citations
already
made
we
find
bacon
alluding
to
the
recent
voyage
of
columbus
and
speaking
of
the
prophecy
of
daniel
regarding
the
latter
days
that
many
shall
run
to
and
fro
and
knowledge
be
increased
as
clearly
signifying
that
the
circumnavigation
of
the
world
and
the
increase
of
science
should
happen
in
the
same
age
see
the
novum
organon
translated
by
the
rev
kitchin
oxford
chaps
lxv
and
lxxxix
in
his
great
work
on
the
advancement
of
learning
the
firm
grasp
which
the
methods
he
condemned
held
upon
him
is
shown
yet
more
clearly
in
the
first
book
of
it
he
asserts
that
that
excellent
book
of
job
if
it
be
revolved
with
diligence
will
be
found
pregnant
and
swelling
with
natural
philosophy
and
he
endeavours
to
show
that
in
it
the
roundness
of
the
earth
the
fixing
of
the
stars
ever
standing
at
equal
distances
the
depression
of
the
southern
pole
the
matter
of
generation
and
matter
of
minerals
are
with
great
elegancy
noted
but
curiously
enough
he
uses
to
support
some
of
these
truths
the
very
texts
which
the
fathers
of
the
church
used
to
destroy
them
and
those
for
which
he
finds
scripture
warrant
most
clearly
are
such
as
science
has
since
disproved
so
too
he
says
that
solomon
was
enabled
in
his
proverbs
by
donation
of
god
to
compile
a
natural
history

verdure

certainly
no
more
striking
examples
of
the
strength
of
the
evil
which
he
had
all
along
been
denouncing
could
be
exhibited
that
these
in
his
own
writings
nothing
better
illustrates
the
sway
of
the
mediaeval
theology
or
better
explains
his
blindness
to
the
discoveries
of
copernicus

to

experiments

such
was
the
struggle
of
the
physical
sciences
in
general
let
us
now
look
briefly
at
one
special
example
out
of
many
which
reveals
as
well
as
any
one
of
the
main
theories
which
prompted
theological
interference
with
them
it
will
doubtless
seem
amazing
to
many
that
for
ages
the
weight
of
theological
thought
in
christendom
was
thrown
against
the
idea
of
the
suffocating
properties
of
certain
gases
and
especially
of
carbonic
acid
although
in
antiquity
we
see
men
forming
a
right
theory
of
gases
in
mines
we
find
that
early
in
the
history
of
the
church
clement
of
alexandria
put
forth
the
theory
that
these
gases
are
manifestations
of
diabolic
action
and
that
throughout
christendom
suffocation
in
caverns
wells
and
cellars
was
attributed
to
the
direct
action
of
evil
spirits
evidences
of
this
view
abound
through
the
medieval
period
and
during
the
reformation
period
a
great
authority
agricola
one
of
the
most
earnest
and
truthful
of
investigators
still
adhered
to
the
belief
that
these
gases
in
mines
were
manifestations
of
devils
and
he
specified
two
classes
one
of
malignant
imps
who
blow
out
the
lamps
and
the
other
of
friendly
imps
who
simply
tease
the
workmen
in
various
ways
he
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
one
of
these
spirits
in
the
saxon
mine
of
annaberg
destroyed
twelve
workmen
at
once
by
the
power
of
his
breath
at
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
we
find
a
writer
on
mineralogy
complaining
that
the
mines
in
france
and
germany
had
been
in
large
part
abandoned
on
account
of
the
evil
spirits
of
metals
which
had
taken
possession
of
them
even
as
late
as
the
seventeenth
century
van
helmont
after
he
had
broken
away
from
alchemy
and
opened
one
of
the
great
paths
to
chemistry
even
after
he
had
announced
to
the
world
the
existence
of
various
gases
and
the
mode
of
their
generation
was
not
strong
enough
to
free
himself
from
theologic
bias
he
still
inclined
to
believe
that
the
gases
he
had
discovered
were
in
some
sense
living
spirits
beneficent
or
diabolical
but
at
various
periods
glimpses
of
the
truth
had
been
gained
the
ancient
view
had
not
been
entirely
forgotten
and
as
far
back
as
the
first
part
of
the
thirteenth
century
albert
the
great
suggested
a
natural
cause
in
the
possibility
of
exhalations
from
minerals
causing
a
corruption
of
the
air
but
he
as
we
have
seen
was
driven
or
dragged
off
into
theological
studies
and
the
world
relapsed
into
the
theological
view
toward
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
there
had
come
a
great
genius
laden
with
important
truths
in
chemistry
but
for
whom
the
world
was
not
ready
basil
valentine
his
discoveries
anticipated
much
that
has
brought
fame
and
fortune
to
chemists
since
yet
so
fearful
of
danger
was
he
that
his
work
was
carefully
concealed
not
until
after
his
death
was
his
treatise
on
alchemy
found
and
even
then
it
was
for
a
long
time
not
known
where
and
when
he
lived
the
papal
bull
spondent
pariter
and
the
various
prohibitions
it
bred
forcing
other
alchemists
to
conceal
their
laboratories
led
him
to
let
himself
be
known
during
his
life
at
erfurt
simply
as
an
apothecary
and
to
wait
until
after
his
death
to
make
a
revelation
of
truth
which
during
his
lifetime
might
have
cost
him
dear
among
the
legacies
of
this
greatest
of
the
alchemists
was
the
doctrine
that
the
air
which
asphyxiates
workers
in
mines
is
similar
to
that
which
is
produced
by
fermentation
of
malt
and
a
recommendation
that
in
order
to
drive
away
the
evil
and
to
prevent
serious
accidents
fires
be
lighted
and
jets
of
steam
used
to
ventilate
the
mines
stress
being
especially
laid
upon
the
idea
that
the
danger
in
the
mines
is
produced
by
exhalations
of
metals
thanks
to
men
like
valentine
this
idea
of
the
interference
of
satan
and
his
minions
with
the
mining
industry
was
gradually
weakened
and
the
working
of
the
deserted
mines
was
resumed
yet
even
at
a
comparatively
recent
period
we
find
it
still
lingering
and
among
leading
divines
in
the
very
heart
of
protestant
germany
in
a
having
been
stifled
at
jena
the
medical
faculty
of
the
university
decided
that
the
cause
was
not
the
direct
action
of
the
devil
but
a
deadly
gas
thereupon
loescher
of
the
university
of
wittenberg
entered
a
solemn
protest
declaring
that
the
decision
of
the
medical
faculty
was
only
a
proof
of
the
lamentable
license
which
has
so
taken
possession
of
us
and
which
if
we
are
not
earnestly
on
our
guard
will
finally
turn
away
from
us
the
blessing
of
god
but
denunciations
of
this
kind
could
not
hold
back
the
little
army
of
science
in
spite
of
adverse
influences
the
evolution
of
physics
and
chemistry
went
on
more
and
more
there
rose
men
bold
enough
to
break
away
from
theological
methods
and
strong
enough
to
resist
ecclesiastical
bribes
and
threats
as
alchemy
in
its
first
form
seeking
for
the
philosopher
stone
and
the
transmutation
of
metals
had
given
way
to
alchemy
in
its
second
form
seeking
for
the
elixir
of
life
and
remedies
more
or
less
magical
for
disease
so
now
the
latter
yielded
to
the
search
for
truth
as
truth
more
and
more
the
solemnly
constituted
impostors
were
resisted
in

just
at
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
at
the
very
centre
of
opposition
to
physical
science
robert
boyle
began
the
new
epoch
in
chemistry
strongly
influenced
by
the
writings
of
bacon
and
the
discoveries
of
galileo
he
devoted
himself
to
scientific
research
establishing
at
oxford
a
laboratory
and
putting
into
it
a
chemist
from
strasburg
for
this
he
was
at
once
bitterly
attacked
in
spite
of
his
high
position
his
blameless
life
his
liberal
gifts
to
charity
and
learning
the
oxford
pulpit
was
especially
severe
against
him
declaring
that
his
researches
were
destroying
religion
and
his
experiments
undermining
the
university
public
orators
denounced
him
the
wits
ridiculed
him
and
his
associates
in
the
peerage
were
indignant
that
he
should
condescend
to
pursuits
so
unworthy
but
boyle
pressed
on
his
discoveries
opened
new
paths
in
various
directions
and
gave
an
impulse
to
a
succession
of
vigorous
investigators
thus
began
the
long
series
of
discoveries
culminating
those
of
black
bergmann
cavendish
priestley
and
lavoisier
who
ushered
in
the
chemical
science
of
the
nineteenth
century
yet
not
even
then
without
a
sore
struggle
against
unreason
and
it
must
here
be
noticed
that
this
unreason
was
not
all
theological
the
unreasoning
heterodox
when
intrusted
with
irresponsible
power
can
be
as
and
cruel
as
the
unreasoning
orthodox
lavoisier
one
of
the
best
of
our
race
not
only
a
great
chemist
but
a
true
man
was
sent
to
the
scaffold
by
the
parisian
mob
led
by
bigoted
liberals
and
atheists
with
the
sneer
that
the
republic
had
no
need
of
savants
as
to
priestley
who
had
devoted
his
life
to
science
and
to
every
good
work
among
his
the
birmingham
mob
favoured
by
the
anglican
clergymen
who
harangued
them
as
wrecked
his
house
destroyed
his
library
philosophical
instruments
and
papers
containing
the
results
of
long
years
of
scientific
research
drove
him
into
exile
and
would
have
murdered
him
if
they
could
have
laid
their
hands
upon
him
nor
was
it
entirely
his
devotion
to
rational
liberty
nor
even
his
disbelief
in
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
which
brought
on
this
catastrophe
that
there
was
a
deep
distrust
of
his
scientific
pursuits
was
evident
when
the
leaders
of
the
mob
took
pains
to
use
his
electrical
apparatus
to
set
fire
to
his
papers
still
though
theological
modes
of
thought
continued
to
sterilize
much
effort
in
chemistry
the
old
influence
was
more
and
more
thrown
off
and
truth
sought
more
and
more
for
truth
sake
black
magic
with
its
satanic
machinery
vanished

reappearing
occasionally

though
it
went
on
with

felt
in
various
ways
the
reaction
which
followed
the
french
revolution
it
was
not
merely
under
the
bourbons
and
hapsburgs
that
resistance
was
offered
even
in
england
the
old
spirit
lingered
long
as
late
as
when
the
british
association
for
the
advancement
of
science
first
visited
oxford
no
less
amiable
a
man
than
john
keble
at
that
time
a
power
in
the
university
condemned
indignantly
the
conferring
of
honorary
degrees
upon
the
leading
men
thus
brought
together
in
a
letter
of
that
date
to
pusey
he
complained
bitterly
to
use
his
own
words
that
the
oxford
doctors
have
truckled
sadly
to
the
spirit
of
the
times
in
receiving
the
hotchpotch
of
philosophers
as
they
did
it
is
interesting
to
know
that
among
the
men
thus
contemptuously
characterized
were
brewster
faraday
and
dalton
nor
was
this
a
mere
isolated
exhibition
of
feeling
it
lasted
many
years
and
was
especially
shown
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
in
all
higher
institutions
of
learning
where
theology
was
dominant
down
to
a
period
within
the
memory
of
men
still
in
active
life
students
in
the
sciences
not
only
at
oxford
and
cambridge
but
at
harvard
and
yale
were
considered
a
doubtful
if
not
a
distinctly
inferior
class
intellectually
and
socially
to
be
relegated
to
different
instructors
and
buildings
and
to
receive
their
degrees
on
a
different
occasion
and
with
different
ceremonies
from
those
appointed
for
students
in
literature
to
the
state

of
michigan
among
the
greater
american
institutions
of
learning
which
have
never
possessed
or
been
possessed
by
a
theological
seminary
belongs
the
honour
of
first
breaking
down
this
wall
of
separation
but
from
the
middle
years
of
the
century
chemical
science
progressed
with
force
and
the
work
of
bunsen
kirchhoff
dalton
and
faraday
has
in
the
last
years
of
the
century
led
up
to
the
establishment
of

by
which
chemistry
has
become
predictive

astronomy
had
become

by
the
calculations
of

of

succession
were
developing
physics
out
of
another
form
first
in
this
latter
succession
may
be
mentioned
that
line
of
thinkers
who
divined
and
reasoned
out
great
physical
laws
a
line
extending
from
galileo
and
kepler
and
newton
to
ohm
and
faraday
and
joule
and
helmholtz
these
by
revealing
more
and
more
clearly
the
reign
of
law
steadily
undermined
the
older
theological
view
of
arbitrary
influence
in
nature
next
should
be
mentioned
the
line
of
profound
observers
from
galileo
and
torricelli
to
kelvin
these
have
as
thoroughly
undermined
the
old
theologic
substitution
of
phrases
for
facts
when
galileo
dropped
the
differing
weights
from
the
leaning
tower
of
pisa
he
began
the
end
of
aristotelian
authority
in
physics
when
torricelli
balanced
a
column
of
mercury
against
a
column
of
water
and
each
of
these
against
a
column
of
air
he
ended
the
theologic
phrase
that
nature
abhors
a
vacuum
when
newton
approximately
determined
the
velocity
of
sound
he
ended
the
theologic
argument
that
we
see
the
flash
before
we
hear
the
roar
because
sight
is
nobler
than
hearing
when
franklin
showed
that
lightning
is
caused
by
electricity
and
ohm
and
faraday
proved
that
electricity
obeys
ascertained
laws
they
ended
the
theological
idea
of
a
divinity
seated
above
the
clouds
and
casting
thunderbolts
resulting
from
the
labour
of
both
these
branches
of
physical
science
we
have
the
establishment
of
the
great
laws
of
the
indestructibility
of
matter
the
correlation
of
forces
and
chemical
affinity
thereby
is
ended
with
various
other
sacred
traditions
the
theological
theory
of
a
visible
universe
created
out
of
nothing

imbedded

the
theological

among
those
who
can
not
relinquish
the
idea
that
our
body
of
sacred
literature
should
be
kept

controlling
of

the
only
effect
of
such
teachings
has
been
to
weaken

has
of
late
years
been
mainly
confined

excluding

diluting
it
in
university
teachings
early
in
the
present
century
a
great
effort
was
made
by
ferdinand
vii
of
spain
he
simply
dismissed
the
scientific
professors
from
the
university
of

and
until
a
recent
period
there
has
been
general
exclusion
from
spanish
universities
of
professors
holding
to
the
newtonian
physics
so
too
the
contemporary
emperor
of

attempted

sort

war
between
theology
and
science
which
had
long
been
smouldering
came
in
the
years
and
to
an
outbreak
toward
the
end
of
the
last
century
after
the
church
had
held
possession
of
advanced
instruction
for
more
than
a
thousand
years
and
had
so
far
as
it
was
able
kept
experimental
science
in
servitude
after
it
had
humiliated
buffon
in
natural
science
thrown
its
weight
against
newton
in
the
physical
sciences
and
wrecked
turgot
noble
plans
for
a
system
of
public
instruction
the
french
nation
decreed
the
establishment
of
the
most
thorough
and
complete
system
of
higher
instruction
in
science
ever
known
it
was
kept
under
lay
control
and
became
one
of
the
glories
of
france
but
emboldened
by
the
restoration
of
the
bourbons
in
the
church
began
to
undermine
this
hated
system
and
in
had
made
such
progress
that
all
was
ready
for
the
final
assault
foremost
among
the
leaders
of
the
besieging
party
was
the
bishop
of
orleans
dupanloup
a
man
of
many
winning
characteristics
and
of
great
oratorical
power
in
various
ways
and
especially
in
an
open
letter
he
had
fought
the
materialism
of
science
at
paris
and
especially
were
his
attacks
levelled
at
profs
vulpian
and
see
and
the
minister
of
public
instruction
duruy
a
man
of
great
merit
whose
only
crime
was
devotion
to
the
improvement
of
education
and
to
the
promotion
of
the
highest
research
in
science
for
the
exertions
of
the
restored
bourbons

crush

see
the
revue

of
the
main
attack
was
made
rather
upon
biological
science
than
upon
physics
and
chemistry
yet
it
was
clear
that
all
were
involved
together
the
first
onslaught
was
made
in
the
french
senate
and
the
storming
party
in
that
body
was
led
by
a
venerable
and
conscientious
prelate
cardinal
de
bonnechose
archbishop
of
rouen
it
was
charged
by
him
and
his
party
that
the
tendencies
of
the
higher
scientific
teaching
at
paris
were
fatal
to
religion
and
morality
heavy
missiles
were
hurled
such
phrases
as
sapping
the
foundations
breaking
down
the
bulwarks
and
the
like
and
withal
a
new
missile
was
used
with
much
effect
the
epithet
materialist
the
results
can
be
easily
guessed
crowds
came
to
the
of
the
attacked
professors
and
the
of
see
the
chief
offender
was
crowded
to
suffocation
a
siege
was
begun
in
due
form
a
young
physician
was
sent
by
the
cardinal
party
into
the
heterodox
camp
as
a
spy
having
heard
one
lecture
of
see
he
returned
with
information
that
seemed
to
promise
easy
victory
to
the
besieging
party
he
brought
a
terrible
statement
one
that
seemed
enough
to
overwhelm
see
vulpian
duruy
and
the
whole
hated
system
of
public
instruction
in
france
the
statement
that
see
had
denied
the
existence
of
the
human
soul
cardinal
bonnechose
seized
the
tremendous
weapon
at
once
rising
in
his
place
in
the
senate
he
launched
a
most
eloquent
invective
against
the
minister
of
state
who
could
protect
such
a
fortress
of
impiety
as
the
college
of
medicine
and
as
a
climax
he
asserted
on
the
evidence
of
his
spy
fresh
from
see
that
the
professor
had
declared
in
his
lecture
of
the
day
before
that
so
long
as
he
had
the
honour
to
hold
his
professorship
he
would
combat
the
false
idea
of
the
existence
of
the
soul
the
weapon
seemed
resistless
and
the
wound
fatal
but
duruy
rose
and
asked
to
be
heard
his
statement
was
simply
that
he
held
in
his
hand
documentary
proofs
that
see
never
made
such
a
declaration
he
held
the
notes
used
by
see
in
his
lecture
see
it
appeared
belonged
to
a
school
in
medical
science
which
combated
certain
ideas
regarding
medicine
as
an
art
the
inflamed
imagination
of
the
cardinal
emissary
had
as
the
proved
led
him
to
mistake
the
word
art
for
ame
and
to
exhibit
see
as
treating
a
theological
when
he
was
discussing
a
purely
scientific
question
of
the
existence
of
the
soul
the
professor
had
said
nothing
the
forces
of
the
enemy
were
immediately
turned
they
retreated
in
confusion
amid
the
laughter
of
all
france
and
a
quiet
dignified
statement
as
to
the
rights
of
scientific
instructors
by
wurtz
dean
of
the
faculty
completed
their
discomfiture
thus
a
attempt
to
check
science
simply
ended
in
bringing
ridicule
on
religion
and
in
thrusting
still
deeper
into
the
minds
of
thousands
of
men
that
most
mistaken
of
all
mistaken
ideas
the
conviction
that
religion
and
science
are
enemies

up
a
declaration

by
students
in

expressing
sincere
regret
that

are
perverted
by

in

into
occasion
for
casting
doubt
upon
the
truth
and

of

nine

was

it
their
duty
to
meet
for
the
denunciation
of

falsely
so
called
two
results
followed
upon
the
great
majority
of
these
really
men
whose
first
utterances
showed
complete
ignorance
of
the
theories
they
attacked
there
came
quiet
and
widespread
contempt
upon
pastor
knak
who
stood
forth
and
proclaimed
views
of
the
universe
which
he
thought
scriptural
but
which
most
schoolboys
knew
to
be
childish
came
a
burst
of
derision
from
every
quarter
of
the
german
nation
see
the
berlin
newspapers
for
the
summer
of
especially
kladderdatsch
but
in
all
the
greater
modern
nations
warfare
of
this
kind
after
the
first
quarter
of
the
nineteenth
century
became
more
and
more
futile
while
conscientious
roman
bishops
and
no
less
conscientious
protestant
clergymen
in
europe
and
america
continued
to
insist
that
advanced
education
not
only
in
literature
but
in
science
should
be
kept
under
careful
control
in
their
own
sectarian
universities
and
colleges
wretchedly
in
organization
and
inadequate
in
equipment
while
catholic
clerical
authorities
in
spain
were
rejecting
all
professors
holding
the
newtonian
theory
and
in
austria
and
italy
all
holding
unsafe
views
regarding
the
immaculate
conception
and
while
protestant
clerical
authorities
in
great
britain
and
america
were
keeping
out
of
professorships
men
holding
unsatisfactory
views
regarding
the
incarnation
or
infant
baptism
or
the
apostolic
succession
or
ordination
by
elders
or
the
perseverance
of
the
saints
and
while
both
catholic
and
protestant
ecclesiastics
were
openly
or
secretly
weeding
out
of
university
faculties
all
who
showed
willingness
to
consider
fairly
the
ideas
of
darwin
a
movement
was
quietly
in
progress
destined
to
take
instruction
and
especially
instruction
in
the
physical
and
natural
sciences
out
of
its
old
subordination
to
theology
and
ecclesiasticism
whatever
may
be
thought
of
the
system
of
philosophy
advocated
by
president
mccosh
at
princeton
every
thinking
man
must
honor
him
for
the
large
way
in
which
he
at
least
broke
away
from
the
traditions
of
that
centre
of
thought
prevented
so
far
as
he
was
able
persecution
of
scholars
for
holding
to
the
darwinian
view
and
paved
the
way
for
the
highest
researches
in
physical
science
in
that
university
for
a
most
eloquent
statement
of
the
opposition
of
modern
physical
science
to
mediaeval
theological
views
as
shown
in
the
case
of
sir
isaac
newton
see
thomas
chalmers
cited
in
gore
art
of
scientific
discovery
london
the
most
striking
beginnings
of
this
movement
had
been
seen
when
in
the
darkest
period
of
the
french
revolution
there
was
founded
at
paris
the
great
conservatory
of
arts
and
trades
and
when
in
the
early
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
scientific
and
technical
education
spread
quietly
upon
the
continent
by
the
middle
of
the
century
france
and
germany
were
dotted
with
technical
and
scientific
schools
each
having
chemical
and
physical
laboratories
the
lands
lagged
behind
in
england
oxford
and
cambridge
showed
few
if
any
signs
of
this
movement
and
in
the
united
states
down
to
evidences
of
it
were
few
and
feeble
very
significant
is
it
that
at
that
period
while
yale
college
had
in
its
faculty
silliman
and
olmsted
the
professor
of
chemistry
and
the
professor
of
physics
most
widely
known
in
the
united
states
it
had
no
physical
or
chemical
laboratory
in
the
modern
sense
and
confined
its
instruction
in
these
subjects
to
examinations
upon
a
and
the
presentation
of
a
few
lectures
at
the
state
university
of
michigan
which
had
even
then
taken
a
foremost
place
in
the
higher
education
west
of
the
great
lakes
there
was
very
meagre
instruction
in
chemistry
and
virtually
none
in
physics
this
being
the
state
of
things
in
the
middle
of
the
century
in
institutions
remarkably
free
from
clerical
control
it
can
be
imagined
what
was
the
position
of
scientific
instruction
in
smaller
colleges
and
universities
where
theological
considerations
were
entirely
dominant
but
in
with
the
international
exhibition
at
london
began
in
great
britain
and
america
a
movement
in
favour
of
scientific
education
men
of
wealth
and
public
spirit
began
making
contributions
to
them
and
thus
came
the
growth
of
a
new
system
of
instruction
in
which
chemistry
and
physics
took
just
rank
by
far
the
most
marked
feature
in
this
movement
was
seen
in
america
when
in
justin
morrill
a
young
member
of
congress
from
vermont
presented
the
project
of
a
law
endowing
from
the
public
lands
a
broad
national
system
of
colleges
in
which
scientific
and
technical
studies
should
be
placed
on
an
equality
with
studies
in
classical
literature
one
such
college
to
be
established
in
every
state
of
the
union
the
bill
though
opposed
mainly
by
representatives
from
the
southern
states
where
doctrinaire
politics
and
orthodox
theology
were
in
strong
alliance
with
negro
slavery
was
passed
by
both
houses
of
congress
but
vetoed
by
president
buchanan
in
whom
the
doctrinaire
and
orthodox
spirit
was
incarnate
but
morrill
persisted
and
again
presented
his
bill
which
was
again
carried
in
spite
of
the
opposition
of
the
southern
members
and
again
vetoed
in
by
president
buchanan
then
came
the
civil
war
but
morrill
and
his
associates
did
not
despair
of
the
republic
in
the
midst
of
all
the
measures
for
putting
vast
armies
into
the
field
and
for
saving
the
union
from
foreign
interference
as
well
as
from
domestic
anarchy
they
again
passed
the
bill
and
in
in
the
darkest
hour
of
the
struggle
for
national
existence
it
became
a
law
by
the
signature
of
president
lincoln
and
here
it
should
not
be
unrecorded
that
while
the
vast
majority
of
the
supporters
of
the
measure
were
laymen
most
efficient
service
was
rendered
by
a
clergyman
the
rev
amos
brown
born
in
new
hampshire
but
at
that
time
an
instructor
in
a
little
village
of
new
york
his
ideas
were
embodied
in
the
bill
and
his
efforts
did
much
for
its
passage
thus
was
established
in
every
state
of
the
american
union
at
least
one
institution
in
which
scientific
and
technical
studies
were
given
equal
rank
with
classical
and
promoted
by
laboratories
for
research
in
physical
and
natural
science
of
these
institutions
there
are
now
nearly
fifty
all
have
proved
valuable
and
some
of
them
by
the
addition
of
splendid
gifts
from
individuals
and
from
the
states
in
which
they
are
situated
have
been
developed
into
great
universities
nor
was
this
all
many
of
the
older
universities
and
colleges
thus
received
a
powerful
stimulus
in
the
new
direction
the
great
physical
and
chemical
laboratories
founded
by
gifts
from
individuals
as
at
harvard
yale
and
chicago
or
by
enlightened
state
legislators
as
in
michigan
wisconsin
minnesota
california
kansas
and
nebraska
have
also
become
centres
from
which
radiate
influences
favouring
the
unfettered
search
for
truth
as
truth
this
system
has
been
long
enough
in
operation
to
enable
us
to
note
in
some
degree
its
effects
on
religion
and
these
are
certainly
such
as
to
relieve
those
who
have
feared
that
religion
was
necessarily
bound
up
with
the
older
instruction
controlled
by
theology
while
in
europe
by
a
natural
reaction
the
colleges
under
strict
ecclesiastical
control
have
sent
forth
the
most
powerful
foes
the
christian
church
has
ever
known
of
whom
voltaire
and
diderot
and
volney
and
and
renan
are
types
no
such
effects
have
been
noted
in
these
newer
institutions
while
the
theological
way
of
looking
at
the
universe
has
steadily
yielded
there
has
been
no
sign
of
any
tendency
toward
irreligion
on
the
contrary
it
is
the
testimony
of
those
best
acquainted
with
the
american
colleges
and
universities
during
the
last
years
that
there
has
been
in
them
a
great
gain
not
only
as
regards
morals
but
as
regards
religion
in
its
highest
and
best
sense
the
reason
is
not
far
to
seek
under
the
old
american
system
the
whole
body
of
students
at
a
university
were
confined
to
a
single
course
for
which
the
majority
cared
little
and
very
many
cared
nothing
and
as
a
result
widespread
idleness
and
dissipation
were
inevitable
under
the
new
system
presenting
various
courses
and
especially
courses
in
various
sciences
appealing
to
different
tastes
and
aims
the
great
majority
of
students
are
interested
and
consequently
indolence
and
dissipation
have
steadily
diminished
moreover
in
the
majority
of
american
institutions
of
learning
down
to
the
middle
of
the
century
the
main
reliance
for
the
religious
culture
of
students
was
in
the
perfunctory
presentation
of
sectarian
theology
and
the
occasional
stirring
up
of
what
were
called
revivals
which
after
a
period
of
unhealthy
stimulus
inevitably
left
the
main
body
of
students
in
a
state
of
religious
and
moral
reaction
and
collapse
this
method
is
now
discredited
and
in
the
more
important
american
universities
it
has
become
impossible
religious
truth
to
secure
the
attention
of
the
modern
race
of
students
in
the
better
american
institutions
is
presented
not
by
sensation
preachers
but
by
thoughtful
scholars
less
and
less
avail
sectarian
arguments
more
and
more
impressive
becomes
the
presentation
of
fundamental
religious
truths
the
result
is
that
while
young
men
care
less
and
less
for
the
great
mass
of
petty
sectarian
formulas
they
approach
the
deeper
questions
of
religion
with
increasing
reverence
while
striking
differences
exist
between
the
european
universities
and
those
of
the
united
states
this
at
least
may
be
said
that
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
the
great
majority
of
the
leading
institutions
of
learning
are
under
the
sway
of
enlightened
public
opinion
as
voiced
mainly
by
laymen
and
that
this
being
the
case
the
physical
and
natural
sciences
are
henceforth
likely
to
be
developed
normally
and
without
fear
of
being
sterilized
by
theology
or
oppressed
by
ecclesiasticism
chapter
xiii
from
miracles
to
medicine
i
the
early
and
sacred
theories
of
disease
nothing
in
the
evolution
of
human
thought
appears
more
inevitable
than
the
idea
of
supernatural
intervention
in
producing
and
curing
disease
the
causes
of
disease
are
so
intricate
that
they
are
reached
only
after
ages
of
scientific
labour
in
those
periods
when
man
sees
everywhere
miracle
and
nowhere
law
when
he
attributes
all
things
which
he
can
not
understand
to
a
will
like
his
own
he
naturally
ascribes
his
diseases
either
to
the
wrath
of
a
good
being
or
to
the
malice
of
an
evil
being
this
idea
underlies
the
connection
of
the
priestly
class
with
the
healing
art
a
connection
of
which
we
have
survivals
among
rude
tribes
in
all
parts
of
the
world
and
which
is
seen
in
nearly
every
ancient
civilization
especially
in
the
powers
over
disease
claimed
in
egypt
by
the
priests
of
osiris
and
isis
in
assyria
by
the
priests
of
gibil
in
greece
by
the
priests
of
aesculapius
and
in
judea
by
the
priests
and
prophets
of
jahveh
in
egypt
there
is
evidence
reaching
back
to
a
very
early
period
that
the
sick
were
often
regarded
as
afflicted
or
possessed
by
demons
the
same
belief
comes
constantly
before
us
in
the
great
religions
of
india
and
china
and
as
regards
chaldea
the
assyrian
tablets
recovered
in
recent
years
while
revealing
the
source
of
so
many
myths
and
legends
transmitted
to
the
modern
world
through
the
book
of
genesis
show
especially
this
idea
of
the
healing
of
diseases
by
the
casting
out
of
devils
a
similar
theory
was
elaborated
in
persia
naturally
then
the
old
testament
so
precious
in
showing
the
evolution
of
religious
and
moral
truth
among
men
attributes
such
diseases
as
the
leprosy
of
miriam
and
uzziah
the
boils
of
job
the
dysentery
of
jehoram
the
withered
hand
of
jeroboam
the
fatal
illness
of
asa
and
many
other
ills
to
the
wrath
of
god
or
the
malice
of
satan
while
in
the
new
testament
such
examples
as
the
woman
bound
by
satan
the
rebuke
of
the
fever
the
casting
out
of
the
devil
which
was
dumb
the
healing
of
the
person
whom
the
devil
ofttimes
casteth
into
the
fire
of
which
case
one
of
the
greatest
modern
physicians
remarks
that
never
was
there
a
truer
description
of
epilepsy
and
various
other
episodes
show
this
same
inevitable
mode
of
thought
as
a
refracting
medium
through
which
the
teachings
and
doings
of
the
great
physician
were
revealed
to
future
generations
in
greece
though
this
idea
of
an
occult
evil
agency
in
producing
bodily
ills
appeared
at
an
early
period
there
also
came
the
first
beginnings
so
far
as
we
know
of
a
really
scientific
theory
of
medicine
five
hundred
years
before
christ
in
the
bloom
period
of
thought
the
period
of
aeschylus
phidias
pericles
socrates
and
plato
appeared
hippocrates
one
of
the
greatest
names
in
history
quietly
but
thoroughly
he
broke
away
from
the
old
tradition
developed
scientific
thought
and
laid
the
foundations
of
medical
science
upon
experience
observation
and
reason
so
deeply
and
broadly
that
his
teaching
remains
to
this
hour
among
the
most
precious
possessions
of
our
race
his
thought
was
passed
on
to
the
school
of
alexandria
and
there
medical
science
was
developed
yet
further
especially
by
such
men
as
herophilus
and
erasistratus
under
their
lead
studies
in
human
anatomy
began
by
dissection
the
old
prejudice
which
had
weighed
so
long
upon
science
preventing
that
method
of
anatomical
investigation
without
which
there
can
be
no
real
results

pp

but
with
the
coming
in
of
christianity
a
great
new
chain
of
events
was
set
in
motion
which
modified
this
development
most
profoundly
the
influence
of
christianity
on
the
healing
art
was
twofold
there
was
first
a
blessed
impulse
the
thought
aspiration
example
ideals
and
spirit
of
jesus
of
nazareth
this
spirit
then
poured
into
the
world
flowed
down
through
the
ages
promoting
for
the
sick
and
wretched
through
all
those
succeeding
centuries
even
through
the
rudest
hospitals
and
infirmaries
sprang
up
along
this
blessed
stream
of
these
were
the
eastern
establishments
for
the
cure
of
the
sick
at
the
earliest
christian
periods
the
infirmary
of
monte
cassino
and
the
at
lyons
in
the
sixth
century
the
at
paris
in
the
seventh
and
the
myriad
refuges
for
the
sick
and
suffering
which
sprang
up
in
every
part
of
europe
during
the
following
centuries
vitalized
by
this
stream
all
medieval
growths
of
mercy
bloomed
luxuriantly
to
say
nothing
of
those
at
an
earlier
period
we
have
in
the
time
of
the
crusades
great
charitable
organizations
like
the
order
of
john
of
jerusalem
and
thenceforward
every
means
of
bringing
the
spirit
of
jesus
to
help
afflicted
humanity
so
too
through
all
those
ages
we
have
a
succession
of
men
and
women
devoting
themselves
to
works
of
mercy
culminating
during
modern
times
in
saints
like
vincent
de
paul
francke
howard
elizabeth
fry
florence
nightingale
and
muhlenberg
but
while
this
vast
influence
poured
forth
from
the
heart
of
the
founder
of
christianity
streamed
through
century
after
century
inspiring
every
development
of
mercy
there
came
from
those
who
organized
the
church
which
bears
his
name
and
from
those
who
afterward
developed
and
directed
it
another
stream
of
influence
a
theology
drawn
partly
from
prehistoric
conceptions
of
unseen
powers
partly
from
ideas
developed
in
the
earliest
historic
nations
but
especially
from
the
letter
of
the
hebrew
and
christian
sacred
books
the
theology
developed
out
of
our
sacred
literature
in
relation
to
the
cure
of
disease
was
mainly
twofold
first
there
was
a
new
and
strong
evolution
of
the
old
idea
that
physical
disease
is
produced
by
the
wrath
of
god
or
the
malice
of
satan
or
by
a
combination
of
both
which
theology
was
especially
called
in
to
explain
secondly
there
were
evolved
theories
of
miraculous
methods
of
cure
based
upon
modes
of
appeasing
the
divine
anger
or
of
thwarting
satanic
malice
along
both
these
streams
of
influence
one
arising
in
the
life
of
jesus
and
the
other
in
the
reasonings
of
theologians
legends
of
miracles
grew
luxuriantly
it
would
be
utterly
unphilosophical
to
attribute
these
as
a
whole
to
conscious
fraud
whatever
part
priestcraft
may
have
taken
afterward
in
sundry
discreditable
developments
of
them
the
mass
of
miraculous
legends
century
after
century
grew
up
mainly
in
good
faith
and
as
naturally
as
elms
along
or
flowers
upon
the
prairie
ii
growth
of
legends
of
healing
the
life
of
xavier
as
a
typical
example
legends
of
miracles
have
thus
grown
about
the
lives
of
all
great
benefactors
of
humanity
in
early
ages
and
about
saints
and
devotees
throughout
human
history
the
lives
of
such
personages
almost
without
exception
have
been
accompanied
or
followed
by
a
literature
in
which
legends
of
miraculous
powers
form
a
very
important
part
a
part
constantly
increasing
until
a
different
mode
of
looking
at
nature
and
of
weighing
testimony
causes
miracles
to
disappear
while
modern
thought
holds
the
testimony
to
the
vast
mass
of
such
legends
in
all
ages
as
worthless
it
is
very
widely
acknowledged
that
great
and
gifted
beings
who
endow
the
earth
with
higher
religious
ideas
gaining
the
deepest
hold
upon
the
hearts
and
minds
of
multitudes
may
at
times
exercise
such
influence
upon
those
about
them
that
the
sick
in
mind
or
body
are
helped
or
healed
we
have
within
the
modern
period
very
many
examples
which
enable
us
to
study
the
evolution
of
legendary
miracles
out
of
these
i
will
select
but
one
which
is
chosen
because
it
is
the
life
of
one
of
the
most
noble
and
devoted
men
in
the
history
of
humanity
one
whose
biography
is
before
the
world
with
its
most
minute
details
in
his
own
letters
in
the
letters
of
his
associates
in
contemporary
histories
and
in
a
multitude
of
biographies
this
man
is
francis
xavier
from
these
sources
i
draw
the
facts
now
to
be
given
but
none
of
them
are
of
protestant
origin
every
source
from
which
i
shall
draw
is
catholic
and
roman
and
published
under
the
sanction
of
the
church
born
a
spanish
noble
xavier
at
an
early
age
cast
aside
all
ordinary
aims
devoted
himself
to
study
was
rapidly
advanced
to
a
professorship
at
paris
and
in
this
position
was
rapidly
winning
a
commanding
influence
when
he
came
under
the
sway
of
another
spaniard
even
greater
though
less
brilliantly
endowed
than
himself
ignatius
loyola
founder
of
the
society
of
jesus
the
result
was
that
the
young
professor
sacrificed
the
brilliant
career
on
which
he
had
entered
at
the
french
capital
went
to
the
far
east
as
a
simple
missionary
and
there
devoted
his
remaining
years
to
redeeming
the
lowest
and
most
wretched
of
our
race
among
the
various
tribes
first
in
lower
india
and
afterward
in
japan
he
wrought
untiringly
toiling
through
village
after
village
collecting
the
natives
by
the
sound
of
a
trying
to
teach
them
the
simplest
christian
formulas
and
thus
he
brought
myriads
of
them
to
a
nominal
confession
of
the
christian
faith
after
twelve
years
of
such
efforts
seeking
new
conquests
for
religion
he
sacrificed
his
life
on
the
desert
island
of
san
chan
during
his
career
as
a
missionary
he
wrote
great
numbers
of
letters
which
were
preserved
and
have
since
been
published
and
these
with
the
letters
of
his
contemporaries
exhibit
clearly
all
the
features
of
his
life
his
own
writings
are
very
minute
and
enable
us
to
follow
him
fully
no
account
of
a
miracle
wrought
by
him
appears
either
in
his
own
letters
or
in
any
contemporary
document
at
the
outside
but
two
or
three
things
occurred
in
his
whole
life
as
exhibited
so
fully
by
himself
and
his
contemporaries
for
which
the
most
earnest
devotee
could
claim
anything
like
divine
interposition
and
these
are
such
as
may
be
read
in
the
letters
of
very
many
fervent
missionaries
protestant
as
well
as
catholic
for
example
in
the
beginning
of
his
career
during
a
journey
in
europe
with
an
ambassador
one
of
the
servants
in
fording
a
stream
got
into
deep
water
and
was
in
danger
of
drowning
xavier
tells
us
that
the
ambassador
prayed
very
earnestly
and
that
the
man
finally
struggled
out
of
the
stream
but
within
sixty
years
after
his
death
at
his
canonization
and
by
various
biographers
this
had
been
magnified
into
a
miracle
and
appears
in
the
various
histories
dressed
out
in
glowing
colours
xavier
tells
us
that
the
ambassador
prayed
for
the
safety
of
the
young
man
but
his
biographers
tell
us
that
it
was
xavier
who
prayed
and
finally
by
the
later
writers
xavier
is
represented
as
lifting
horse
and
rider
out
of
the
stream
by
a
clearly
supernatural
act
this
statement
was
denied
with
much
explosive
emphasis
by
a
writer
in
the
catholic
world
for
september
and
october
but
he
brought
no
fact
to
support
this
denial
i
may
perhaps
be
allowed
to
remind
the
reverend
writer
that
since
the
days
of
pascal
whose
eminence
in
the
church
he
will
hardly
dispute
the
bare
assertion
even
of
a
jesuit
father
against
established
facts
needs
some
support
other
than
mere
scurrility
still
another
claim
to
miracle
is
based
upon
his
arriving
at
lisbon
and
finding
his
great
colleague
simon
rodriguez
ill
of
fever
xavier
informs
us
in
a
very
simple
way
that
rodriguez
was
so
overjoyed
to
see
him
that
the
fever
did
not
return
this
is
entirely
similar
to
the
cure
which
martin
luther
wrought
upon
melanchthon
melanchthon
had
broken
down
and
was
supposed
to
be
dying
when
his
joy
at
the
visit
of
luther
brought
him
to
his
feet
again
after
which
he
lived
for
many
years
again
it
is
related
that
xavier
finding
a
poor
native
woman
very
ill
baptized
her
saying
over
her
the
prayers
of
the
church
and
she
recovered
two
or
three
occurrences
like
these
form
the
whole
basis
for
the
miraculous
account
so
far
as
xavier
own
writings
are
concerned
of
miracles
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
there
is
in
these
letters
of
his
no
mention
though
he
writes
of
his
doings
with
especial
detail
taking
evident
pains
to
note
everything
which
he
thought
a
sign
of
divine
encouragement
he
says
nothing
of
his
performing
miracles
and
evidently
knows
nothing
of
them
this
is
clearly
not
due
to
his
unwillingness
to
make
known
any
token
of
divine
favour
as
we
have
seen
he
is
very
prompt
to
report
anything
which
may
be
considered
an
answer
to
prayer
or
an
evidence
of
the
power
of
religious
means
to
improve
the
bodily
or
spiritual
health
of
those
to
whom
he
was
sent
nor
do
the
letters
of
his
associates
show
knowledge
of
any
miracles
wrought
by
him
his
brother
missionaries
who
were
in
constant
and
loyal
fellowship
with
him
make
no
allusions
to
them
in
their
communications
with
each
other
or
with
their
brethren
in
europe
of
this
fact
we
have
many
striking
evidences
various
collections
of
letters
from
the
jesuit
missionaries
in
india
and
the
east
generally
during
the
years
of
xavier
activity
were
published
and
in
not
one
of
these
letters
written
during
xavier
lifetime
appears
any
account
of
a
miracle
wrought
by
him
as
typical
of
these
collections
we
may
take
perhaps
the
most
noted
of
all
that
which
was
published
about
twenty
years
after
xavier
death
by
a
jesuit
father
emanuel
acosta
the
letters
given
in
it
were
written
by
xavier
and
his
associates
not
only
from
goa
which
was
the
focus
of
all
missionary
effort
and
the
centre
of
all
knowledge
regarding
their
work
in
the
east
but
from
all
other
important
points
in
the
great
field
the
first
of
them
were
written
during
the
saint
lifetime
but
though
filled
with
every
sort
of
detail
regarding
missionary
life
and
work
they
say
nothing
regarding
any
miracles
by
xavier
the
same
is
true
of
various
other
similar
collections
published
during
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
in
not
one
of
them
does
any
mention
of
a
miracle
by
xavier
appear
in
a
letter
from
india
or
the
east
contemporary
with
him
this
silence
regarding
his
miracles
was
clearly
not
due
to
any
evil
heart
of
unbelief
on
the
contrary
these
good
missionary
fathers
were
prompt
to
record
the
slightest
occurrence
which
they
thought
evidence
of
the
divine
favour
it
is
indeed
touching
to
see
how
eagerly
they
grasp
at
the
most
trivial
things
which
could
be
thus
construed
their
ample
faith
was
fully
shown
one
of
them
in
acosta
collection
sends
a
report
that
an
illuminated
cross
had
been
recently
seen
in
the
heavens
another
that
devils
had
been
cast
out
of
the
natives
by
the
use
of
holy
water
another
that
various
cases
of
disease
had
been
helped
and
even
healed
by
baptism
and
sundry
others
sent
reports
that
the
blind
and
dumb
had
been
restored
and
that
even
lepers
had
been
cleansed
by
the
proper
use
of
the
rites
of
the
church
but
to
xavier
no
miracles
are
imputed
by
his
associates
during
his
life
or
during
several
years
after
his
death
on
the
contrary
we
find
his
own
statements
as
to
his
personal
limitations
and
the
difficulties
arising
from
them
fully
confirmed
by
his
brother
workers
it
is
interesting
for
example
in
view
of
the
claim
afterward
made
that
the
saint
was
divinely
endowed
for
his
mission
with
the
gift
of
tongues
to
note
in
these
letters
confirmation
of
xavier
own
statement
utterly
disproving
the
existence
of
any
such
divine
gift
and
detailing
the
difficulties
which
he
encountered
from
his
want
of
knowing
various
languages
and
the
hard
labour
which
he
underwent
in
learning
the
elements
of
the
japanese
tongue
until
about
ten
years
after
xavier
death
then
as
emanuel
publication
shows
the
letters
of
the
missionaries
continued
without
any
indication
of
miracles
performed
by
the
saint
though
as
we
shall
see
presently
abundant
legends
had
already
begun
to
grow
elsewhere
not
one
word
regarding
these
miracles
came
as
yet
from
the
country
which
according
to
later
accounts
accepted
and
sanctioned
by
the
church
was
at
this
very
period
filled
with
miracles
not
the
slightest
indication
of
them
from
the
men
who
were
supposed
to
be
in
the
very
thick
of
these
miraculous
manifestations
but
this
negative
evidence
is
by
no
means
all
there
is
also
positive
evidence
direct
testimony
from
the
jesuit
order
itself
that
xavier
wrought
no
miracles
for
not
only
did
neither
xavier
nor
his
know
anything
of
the
mighty
works
afterward
attributed
to
him
but
the
highest
contemporary
authority
on
the
whole
subject
a
man
in
the
closest
correspondence
with
those
who
knew
most
about
the
saint
a
member
of
the
society
of
jesus
in
the
highest
standing
and
one
of
its
accepted
historians
not
only
expressly
tells
us
that
xavier
wrought
no
miracles
but
gives
the
reasons
why
he
wrought
none
this
man
was
joseph
acosta
a
provincial
of
the
jesuit
order
its
visitor
in
aragon
superior
at
valladolid
and
finally
rector
of
the
university
of
salamanca
in
nineteen
years
after
death
acosta
devoted
himself
to
writing
a
work
mainly
concerning
the
conversion
of
the
indies
and
in
this
he
refers
especially
and
with
the
greatest
reverence
to
xavier
holding
him
up
as
an
ideal
and
his
work
as
an
example
but
on
the
same
page
with
this
tribute
to
the
great
missionary
acosta
goes
on
to
discuss
the
reasons
why
progress
in
the
world
conversion
is
not
so
rapid
as
in
the
early
apostolic
times
and
says
that
an
especial
cause
why
apostolic
preaching
could
no
longer
produce
apostolic
results
lies
in
the
missionaries
themselves
because
there
is
now
no
power
of
working
miracles
he
then
asks
why
should
our
age
be
so
completely
destitute
of
them
this
question
he
answers
at
great
length
and
one
of
his
main
contentions
is
that
in
early
apostolic
times
illiterate
men
had
to
convert
the
learned
of
the
world
whereas
in
modern
times
the
case
is
reversed
learned
men
being
sent
to
convert
the
illiterate
and
hence
that
in
the
early
times
miracles
were
necessary
but
in
our
time
they
are
not
this
statement
and
argument
refer
as
we
have
seen
directly
to
xavier
by
name
and
to
the
period
covered
by
his
activity
and
that
of
the
other
great
missionaries
of
his
time
that
the
jesuit
order
and
the
church
at
large
thought
this
work
of
acosta
trustworthy
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
it
was
published
at
salamanca
a
few
years
after
it
was
written
and
republished
afterward
with
ecclesiastical
sanction
in
france
nothing
shows
better
than
the
sequel
how
completely
the
evolution
of
miraculous
accounts
depends
upon
the
intellectual
atmosphere
of
any
land
and
time
and
how
independent
it
is
of
fact
the
work
of
joseph
acosta
is
in
the
cornell
university
library
its
title
being
as
follows

for
a
passage
which
shows
that
xavier
was
not
then
at
all
credited
with
the
miraculous
gift
of
tongues
see
lib
i
cap
vii
since
writing
the
above
my
attention
has
been
called
to
the
alleged
miraculous
preservation
of
xavier
body
claimed
in
sundry
letters
contemporary
with
its
disinterment
at
san
chan
and
reinterment
at
goa
there
is
no
reason
why
this
preservation
in
itself
need
be
doubted
and
no
reason
why
it
should
be
counted
miraculous
such
exceptional
preservation
of
bodies
has
been
common
enough
in
all
ages
and
alas
for
the
claims
of
the
church
quite
as
common
of
pagans
or
protestants
as
of
good
catholics
one
of
the
most
famous
cases
is
that
of
the
fair
roman
maiden
julia
daughter
of
claudius
over
whose
exhumation
at
rome
in
such
ado
was
made
by
the
sceptical
scholars
of
the
renaissance
contemporary
observers
tell
us
enthusiastically
that
she
was
very
beautiful
perfectly
preserved
the
bloom
of
youth
still
upom
her
cheeks
and
exhaling
a
sweet
odour
but
this
enthusiasm
was
so
little
to
the
taste
of
pope
innocent
viii
that
he
had
her
reburied
secretly
by
night
only
the
other
day
in
june
of
the
year
there
was
unearthed
at
stade
in
hanover
the
perfectly
preserved
body
of
a
soldier
of
the
eighth
century
so
too
i
might
mention
the
bodies
preserved
at
the
church
of
thomas
at
strasburg
beneath
the
cathedral
of
bremen
and
elsewhere
during
hundreds
of
years
past
also
the
cases
of
adiposeration
in
various
american
cemeteries
which
never
grow
less
wonderful
by
repetition
from
mouth
to
mouth
and
in
the
public
prints
but
while
such
preservation
is
not
incredible
or
even
strange
there
is
much
reason
why
precisely
in
the
case
of
a
saint
like
francis
xavier
the
evidence
for
it
should
be
received
with
especial
caution
what
the
touching
fidelity
of
disciples
may
lead
them
to
believe
and
proclaim
regarding
an
adored
leader
in
a
time
when
faith
is
thought
more
meritorious
than
careful
statement
and
miracle
more
probable
than
the
natural
course
of
things
is
seen
for
example
in
similar
pious
accounts
regarding
the
bodies
of
many
other
saints
especially
that
of
carlo
borromeo
so
justly
venerated
by
the
church
for
his
beautiful
and
charitable
life
and
yet
any
one
looking
at
the
relics
of
various
saints
especially
those
of
carlo
preserved
with
such
tender
care
in
the
crypt
of
milan
cathedral
will
see
that
they
have
shared
the
common
fate
being
either
mummified
or
reduced
to
skeletons
and
this
is
true
in
all
cases
as
far
as
my
observation
has
extended
what
even
a
great
theologian
can
be
induced
to
believe
and
testify
in
a
somewhat
similar
matter
is
seen
in
declaration
that
the
flesh
of
the
peacock
which
in
antiquity
and
in
the
early
church
was
considered
a
bird
somewhat
supernaturally
endowed
is
incorruptible
the
saint
declares
that
he
tested
it
and
found
it
so
see
the
de
civitate
dei
xxi
under
the
passage
beginning
quis
enim
deus
with
this
we
may
compare
the
testimony
of
the
pious
author
of
sir
john
mandeville
travels
that
iron
floats
upon
the
dead
sea
while
feathers
sink
in
it
and
that
he
would
not
have
believed
this
had
he
not
seen
it
so
too
testimony
to
the
sweet
odour
diffused
by
the
exhumed
remains
of
the
saint
seem
to
indicate
feeling
rather
than
fact
those
highly
wrought
feelings
of
disciples
standing
by
the
same
feeling
which
led
those
who
visited
simon
stylites
on
his
heap
of
ordure
and
other
hermits
unwashed
and
living
in
filth
to
dwell
upon
the
delicious
odour
of
sanctity
pervading
the
air
in
point
perhaps
is
louis
veuillot
idealization
of
the
parfum
de
rome
in
face
of
the
fact
to
which
the
present
writer
and
thousands
of
others
can
testify
that
under
papal
rule
rome
was
materially
one
of
the
most
filthy
cities
in
christendom

companions
from
the
east
indies
and
japan
and
cover
the
years
from
to
though
these
refer
frequently
to
xavier
there
is
no
mention
of
a
miracle
wrought
by
him
in
any
of
them
written
during
his
lifetime
for
shortly
after
xavier
heroic
and
beautiful
death
in
stories
of
miracles
wrought
by
him
began
to
appear
at
first
they
were
few
and
feeble
and
two
years
later
melchior
nunez
provincial
of
the
jesuits
in
the
portuguese
dominions
with
all
the
means
at
his
command
and
a
correspondence
extending
throughout
eastern
asia
had
been
able
to
hear
of
but
three
these
were
entirely
from
hearsay
first
john
deyro
said
he
knew
that
xavier
had
the
gift
of
prophecy
but
unfortunately
xavier
himself
had
reprimanded
and
cast
off
deyro
for
untruthfulness
and
cheatery
secondly
it
was
reported
vaguely
that
at
cape
comorin
many
persons
affirmed
that
xavier
had
raised
a
man
from
the
dead
thirdly
father
pablo
de
santa
fe
had
heard
that
in
japan
xavier
had
restored
sight
to
a
blind
man
this
seems
a
feeble
beginning
but
little
by
little
the
stories
grew
and
in
de
quadros
provincial
of
the
jesuits
in
ethiopia
had
heard
of
nine
miracles
and
asserted
that
xavier
had
healed
the
sick
and
cast
out
devils
the
next
year
being
four
years
after
xavier
death
king
john
iii
of
portugal
a
very
devout
man
directed
his
viceroy
barreto
to
draw
up
and
transmit
to
him
an
authentic
account
of
xavier
miracles
urging
him
especially
to
do
the
work
with
zeal
and
speedily
we
can
well
imagine
what
treasures
of
grace
an
obsequious
viceroy
only
too
anxious
to
please
a
devout
king
could
bring
together
by
means
of
the
hearsay
of
ignorant
compliant
natives
through
all
the
little
towns
of
portuguese
india
but
the
letters
of
the
missionaries
who
had
been
or
immediate
successors
of
xavier
in
his
eastern
field
were
still
silent
as
regards
any
miracles
by
him
and
they
remained
silent
for
nearly
ten
years
in
the
collection
of
letters
published
by
emanuel
acosta
and
others
no
hint
at
any
miracles
by
him
is
given
until
at
last
in
fully
ten
years
after
xavier
death
the
first
faint
beginnings
of
these
legends
appear
in
them
at
that
time
the
jesuit
almeida
writing
at
great
length
to
the
brethren
stated
that
he
had
found
a
pious
woman
who
believed
that
a
book
left
behind
by
xavier
had
healed
sick
folk
when
it
was
laid
upon
them
and
that
he
had
met
an
old
man
who
preserved
a
whip
left
by
the
saint
which
when
properly
applied
to
the
sick
had
been
found
good
both
for
their
bodies
and
their
souls
from
these
and
other
small
beginnings
grew
always
luxuriant
and
sometimes
beautiful
the
vast
mass
of
legends
which
we
shall
see
hereafter
this
growth
was
affectionately
garnered
by
the
more
zealous
and
less
critical
brethren
in
europe
until
it
had
become
enormous
but
it
appears
to
have
been
thought
of
little
value
by
those
best
able
to
judge
for
when
in
julius
gabriel
eugubinus
delivered
a
solemn
oration
on
the
condition
and
glory
of
the
church
before
the
papal
legates
and
other
fathers
assembled
at
the
council
of
trent
while
he
alluded
to
a
multitude
of
things
showing
the
divine
favour
there
was
not
the
remotest
allusion
to
the
vast
multitude
of
miracles
which
according
to
the
legends
had
been
so
profusely
lavished
on
the
faithful
during
many
years
and
which
if
they
had
actually
occurred
formed
an
argument
of
prodigious
value
in
behalf
of
the
special
claims
of
the
church
the
same
complete
absence
of
knowledge
of
any
such
favours
vouchsafed
to
the
church
or
at
least
of
any
belief
in
them
appears
in
that
great
council
of
trent
among
the
fathers
themselves
certainly
there
if
anywhere
one
might
on
the
roman
theory
expect
divine
illumination
in
a
matter
of
this
kind
the
presence
of
the
holy
spirit
in
the
midst
of
it
was
especially
claimed
and
yet
its
members
with
all
their
spiritual
as
well
as
material
advantages
for
knowing
what
had
been
going
on
in
the
church
during
the
previous
thirty
years
and
with
xavier
own
friend
and
colleague
laynez
present
to
inform
them
show
not
the
slightest
sign
of
any
suspicion
of
xavier
miracles
we
have
the
letters
of
julius
gabriel
to
the
foremost
of
these
fathers
assembled
at
trent
from
onward
for
a
considerable
time
and
we
have
also
a
multitude
of
letters
written
from
the
council
by
bishops
cardinals
and
even
by
the
pope
himself
discussing
all
sorts
of
church
affairs
and
in
not
one
of
these
is
there
evidence
of
the
remotest
suspicion
that
any
of
these
reports
which
they
must
have
heard
regarding
xavier
miracles
were
worthy
of
mention
here
too
comes
additional
supplementary
testimony
of
much
significance
with
these
orations
and
letters
eugubinus
gives
a
latin
translation
of
a
letter
on
religious
affairs
in
the
indies
written
by
a
jesuit
father
twenty
years
after
xavier
death
though
the
letter
came
from
a
field
very
distant
from
that
in
which
xavier
laboured
it
was
sure
among
the
general
tokens
of
divine
favour
to
the
church
and
to
the
order
on
which
it
dwelt
to
have
alluded
to
miracles
wrought
by
xavier
had
there
been
the
slightest
ground
for
believing
in
them
but
no
such
allusion
appears
for
the
work
referred
to
see
julii
gabrielii
eugubini
orationum
et
epistolarum
libri
duo
et
epitola
de
rebus
indicis
a
quodam
societatis
jesu
presbytero
venetiis
the
epistola
begins
at
fol
so
too
when
in
years
after
xavier
death
the
jesuit
father
maffei
who
had
been
especially
conversant
with
xavier
career
in
the
east
published
his
history
of
india
though
he
gave
a
biography
of
xavier
which
shows
fervent
admiration
for
his
subject
he
dwelt
very
lightly
on
the
alleged
miracles
but
the
evolution
of
miraculous
legends
still
went
on
six
years
later
in
father
tursellinus
published
his
life
of
xavier
and
in
this
appears
to
have
made
the
first
large
use
of
the
information
collected
by
the
portuguese
viceroy
and
the
more
zealous
brethren
this
work
shows
a
vast
increase
in
the
number
of
miracles
over
those
given
by
all
sources
together
up
to
that
time
xavier
is
represented
as
not
only
curing
the
sick
but
casting
out
devils
stilling
the
tempest
raising
the
dead
and
performing
miracles
of
every
sort
in
came
the
canonization
proceedings
at
rome
among
the
speeches
made
in
the
presence
of
pope
gregory
xv
supporting
the
claims
of
xavier
to
saintship
the
most
important
was
by
cardinal
monte
in
this
the
orator
selects
out
ten
great
miracles
from
those
performed
by
xavier
during
his
lifetime
and
describes
them
minutely
he
insists
that
on
a
certain
occasion
xavier
by
the
sign
of
the
cross
made
fresh
so
that
his
and
the
crew
could
drink
it
that
he
healed
the
sick
and
raised
the
dead
in
various
places
brought
back
a
lost
boat
to
his
ship
was
on
one
occasion
lifted
from
the
earth
bodily
and
transfigured
before
the
bystanders
and
that
to
punish
a
blaspheming
town
he
caused
an
earthquake
and
buried
the
offenders
in
cinders
from
a
volcano
this
was
afterward
still
more
highly
developed
and
the
saint
was
represented
in
engravings
as
calling
down
fire
from
heaven
and
thus
destroying
the
town
the
most
curious
miracle
of
all
is
the
eighth
on
the
cardinal
list
regarding
this
he
states
that
xavier
having
during
one
of
his
voyages
lost
overboard
a
crucifix
it
was
restored
to
him
after
he
had
reached
the
shore
by
a
crab
the
cardinal
also
dwelt
on
miracles
performed
by
xavier
relics
after
his
death
the
most
original
being
that
sundry
lamps
placed
before
the
image
of
the
saint
and
filled
with
holy
water
burned
as
if
filled
with
oil
this
latter
account
appears
to
have
deeply
impressed
the
pope
for
in
the
bull
of
canonization
issued
by
virtue
of
his
power
of
teaching
the
universal
church
infallibly
in
all
matters
pertaining
to
faith
and
morals
his
holiness
dwells
especially
upon
the
miracle
of
the
lamp
filled
with
holy
water
and
burning
before
xavier
image
xavier
having
been
made
a
saint
many
other
lives
of
him
appeared
and
as
a
rule
each
surpassed
its
predecessor
in
the
multitude
of
miracles
in
appeared
that
compiled
and
published
under
the
sanction
of
father
vitelleschi
and
in
it
not
only
are
new
miracles
increased
but
some
old
ones
are
greatly
improved
one
example
will
suffice
to
show
the
process
in
his
edition
of
tursellinus
had
told
how
xavier
one
day
needing
money
and
having
asked
vellio
one
of
his
friends
to
let
him
have
some
vellio
gave
him
the
key
of
a
safe
containing
thirty
thousand
gold
pieces
xavier
took
three
hundred
and
returned
the
key
to
vellio
whereupon
vellio
finding
only
three
hundred
pieces
gone
reproached
xavier
for
not
taking
more
saying
that
he
had
expected
to
give
him
half
of
all
that
the
strong
box
contained
xavier
touched
by
this
generosity
told
vellio
that
the
time
of
his
death
should
be
made
known
to
him
that
he
might
have
opportunity
to
repent
of
his
sins
and
prepare
for
eternity
but
years
later
the
life
of
xavier
published
under
the
sanction
of
vitelleschi
giving
the
story
says
that
vellio
on
opening
the
safe
found
that
all
his
money
remained
as
he
had
left
it
and
that
none
at
all
had
disappeared
in
fact
that
there
had
been
a
miraculous
restitution
on
his
blaming
xavier
for
not
taking
the
money
xavier
declares
to
vellio
that
not
only
shall
he
be
apprised
of
the
moment
of
his
death
but
that
the
box
shall
always
be
full
of
money
still
later
biographers
improved
the
account
further
declaring
that
xavier
promised
vellio
that
the
strong
box
should
always
contain
money
sufficient
for
all
his
needs
in
that
warm
and
uncritical
atmosphere
this
and
other
legends
grew
rapidly
obedient
to
much
the
same
laws
which
govern
the
evolution
of
fairy
tales
the
writer
in
the
catholic
world
already
mentioned
rather
rashly
asserts
that
there
is
no
such
life
of
xavier
as
that
i
have
above
quoted
the
reverend
jesuit
father
has
evidently
glanced
over
the
bibliographies
of
carayon
and
de
backer
and
not
finding
it
there
under
the
name
of
vitelleschi
has
spared
himself
further
trouble
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
the
book
may
be
seen
by
him
in
the
library
of
cornell
university
its
full
title
is
as
follows

my
critic
hazards
a
guess
that
the
book
may
be
a
later
edition
of
torsellino
tursellinus
but
here
again
he
is
wrong
it
is
entirely
a
different
book
giving
in
its
preface
a
list
of
sources
comprising
eleven
authorities
besides
torsellino
in
one
hundred
and
thirty
years
after
xavier
death
appeared
his
biography
by
father
bouhours
and
this
became
a
classic
in
it
the
old
miracles
of
all
kinds
were
enormously
multiplied
and
many
new
ones
given
miracles
few
and
small
in
tursellinus
became
many
and
great
in
bouhours
in
tursellinus
xavier
during
his
life
saves
one
person
from
drowning
in
bouhours
he
saves
during
his
life
three
in
tursellinus
xavier
during
his
life
raises
four
persons
from
the
dead
in
bouhours
fourteen
in
tursellinus
there
is
one
miraculous
supply
of
water
in
bouhours
three
in
tursellinus
there
is
no
miraculous
draught
of
fishes
in
bouhours
there
is
one
in
tursellinus
xavier
is
transfigured
twice
in
bouhours
five
times
and
so
through
a
long
series
of
miracles
which
in
the
earlier
lives
appearing
either
not
at
all
or
in
very
moderate
form
are
greatly
increased
and
enlarged
by
tursellinus
and
finally
enormously
amplified
and
multiplied
by
father
bouhours
and
here
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
bouhours
writing
ninety
years
after
tursellinus
could
not
have
had
access
to
any
new
sources
xavier
had
been
dead
one
hundred
and
thirty
years
and
of
course
all
the
natives
upon
whom
he
had
wrought
his
miracles
and
their
children
and
grandchildren
were
gone
it
can
not
then
be
claimed
that
bouhours
had
the
advantage
of
any
new
witnesses
nor
could
he
have
had
anything
new
in
the
way
of
contemporary
writings
for
as
we
have
seen
the
missionaries
of
xavier
time
wrote
nothing
regarding
his
miracles
and
certainly
the
ignorant
natives
of
india
and
japan
did
not
commit
any
account
of
his
miracles
to
writing
nevertheless
the
miracles
of
healing
given
in
bouhours
were
more
numerous
and
brilliant
than
ever
but
there
was
far
more
than
this
although
during
the
lifetime
of
xavier
there
is
neither
in
his
own
writings
nor
in
any
contemporary
account
any
assertion
of
a
resurrection
from
the
dead
wrought
by
him
we
find
that
shortly
after
his
death
stories
of
such
resurrections
began
to
appear
a
simple
statement
of
the
growth
of
these
may
throw
some
light
on
the
evolution
of
miraculous
accounts
generally
at
first
it
was
affirmed
that
some
people
at
cape
comorin
said
that
he
had
raised
one
person
then
it
was
said
that
there
were
two
persons
then
in
various
authors
emanuel
acosta
in
his
commentaries
written
as
an
afterthought
nearly
twenty
years
after
xavier
death
de
quadros
and
others
the
story
wavers
between
one
and
two
cases
finally
in
the
time
of
tursellinus
four
cases
had
been
developed
in
at
the
canonization
proceedings
three
were
mentioned
but
by
the
time
of
father
bouhours
there
were
fourteen
all
raised
from
the
dead
by
xavier
himself
during
his
lifetime
and
the
name
place
and
circumstances
are
given
with
much
detail
in
each
case
the
writer
in
the
catholic
world
already
referred
to
has
based
an
attack
here
upon
a
misconception
i
will
not
call
it
a
deliberate
misrepresentation
of
his
own
by
stating
that
these
resurrections
occurred
after
xavier
death
and
were
due
to
his
intercession
or
the
use
of
his
relics
the
statement
of
the
jesuit
father
is
utterly
without
foundation
as
a
simple
reference
to
bouhours
will
show
i
take
the
liberty
of
commending
to
his
attention
the
life
of
francis
xavier
by
father
dominic
bouhours
translated
by
james
dryden
dublin
for
examples
of
raising
the
dead
by
the
saint
during
his
lifetime
see
pp
fourteen
cases
in
all
it
seems
to
have
been
felt
as
somewhat
strange
at
first
that
xavier
had
never
alluded
to
any
of
these
wonderful
miracles
but
ere
long
a
subsidiary
legend
was
developed
to
the
effect
that
one
of
the
brethren
asked
him
one
day
if
he
had
raised
the
dead
whereat
he
blushed
deeply
and
cried
out
against
the
idea
saying
and
so
i
am
said
to
have
raised
the
dead
what
a
misleading
man
i
am
some
men
brought
a
youth
to
me
just
as
if
he
were
dead
who
when
i
commanded
him
to
arise
in
the
name
of
christ
straightway
arose
noteworthy
is
the
evolution
of
other
miracles
tursellinus
writing
in
tells
us
that
on
the
voyage
from
goa
to
malacca
xavier
having
left
the
ship
and
gone
upon
an
island
was
afterward
found
by
the
persons
sent
in
search
of
him
so
deeply
absorbed
in
prayer
as
to
be
unmindful
of
all
things
about
him
but
in
the
next
century
father
bouhours
develops
the
story
as
follows
the
servants
found
the
man
of
god
raised
from
the
ground
into
the
air
his
eyes
fixed
upon
heaven
and
rays
of
light
about
his
countenance
instructive
also
is
a
comparison
between
the
successive
accounts
of
his
noted
miracle
among
the
badages
at
travancore
in
xavier
in
his
letters
makes
no
reference
to
anything
extraordinary
and
emanuel
acosta
in
declares
simply
that
xavier
threw
himself
into
the
midst
of
the
christians
that
reverencing
him
they
might
spare
the
rest
the
inevitable
evolution
of
the
miraculous
goes
on
and
twenty
years
later
tursellinus
tells
us
that
at
the
onslaught
of
the
badages
they
could
not
endure
the
majesty
of
his
countenance
and
the
splendour
and
rays
which
issued
from
his
eyes
and
out
of
reverence
for
him
they
spared
the
others
the
process
of
incubation
still
goes
on
during
ninety
years
more
and
then
comes
father
bouhours
account
having
given
xavier
prayer
on
the
battlefield
bouhours
goes
on
to
say
that
the
saint
crucifix
in
hand
rushed
at
the
head
of
the
people
toward
the
plain
where
the
enemy
was
marching
and
said
to
them
in
a
threatening
voice
forbid
you
in
the
name
of
the
living
god
to
advance
farther
and
on
his
part
command
you
to
return
in
the
way
you
came
these
few
words
cast
a
terror
into
the
minds
of
those
soldiers
who
were
at
the
head
of
the
army
they
remained
confounded
and
without
motion
they
who
marched
afterward
seeing
that
the
foremost
did
not
advance
asked
the
reason
of
it
the
answer
was
returned
from
the
front
ranks
that
they
had
before
their
eyes
an
unknown
person
habited
in
black
of
more
than
human
stature
of
terrible
aspect
and
darting
fire
from
his
eyes
they
were
seized
with
amazement
at
the
sight
and
all
of
them
fled
in
precipitate
confusion
curious
too
is
the
of
the
miracle
of
the
crab
restoring
the
crucifix
in
its
first
form
xavier
lost
the
crucifix
in
the
sea
and
the
earlier
biographers
dwell
on
the
sorrow
which
he
showed
in
consequence
but
the
later
historians
declare
that
the
saint
threw
the
crucifix
into
the
sea
in
order
to
still
a
tempest
and
that
after
his
safe
getting
to
land
a
crab
brought
it
to
him
on
the
shore
in
this
form
we
find
it
among
illustrations
of
books
of
devotion
in
the
next
century
but
perhaps
the
best
illustration
of
this
evolution
of
xavier
miracles
is
to
be
found
in
the
growth
of
another
legend
and
it
is
especially
instructive
because
it
grew
luxuriantly
despite
the
fact
that
it
was
utterly
contradicted
in
all
parts
of
xavier
writings
as
well
as
in
the
letters
of
his
associates
and
in
the
work
of
the
jesuit
father
joseph
acosta
throughout
his
letters
from
first
to
last
xavier
constantly
dwells
upon
his
difficulties
with
the
various
languages
of
the
different
tribes
among
whom
he
went
he
tells
us
how
he
surmounted
these
difficulties
sometimes
by
learning
just
enough
of
a
language
to
translate
into
it
some
of
the
main
church
formulas
sometimes
by
getting
the
help
of
others
to
patch
together
some
pious
teachings
to
be
learned
by
rote
sometimes
by
employing
interpreters
and
sometimes
by
a
mixture
of
various
dialects
and
even
by
signs
on
one
occasion
he
tells
us
that
a
very
serious
difficulty
arose
and
that
his
voyage
to
china
was
delayed
because
among
other
things
the
interpreter
he
had
engaged
had
failed
to
meet
him
in
various
lives
which
appeared
between
the
time
of
his
death
and
his
canonization
this
difficulty
is
much
dwelt
upon
but
during
the
canonization
proceedings
at
rome
in
the
speeches
then
made
and
finally
in
the
papal
bull
great
stress
was
laid
upon
the
fact
that
xavier
possessed
the
gift
of
tongues
it
was
declared
that
he
spoke
to
the
various
tribes
with
ease
in
their
own
languages
this
legend
of
miraculous
gift
of
tongues
was
especially
mentioned
in
the
papal
bull
and
was
solemnly
given
forth
by
the
pontiff
as
an
infallible
statement
to
be
believed
by
the
universal
church
gregory
xv
having
been
prevented
by
death
from
issuing
the
bull
of
canonization
it
was
finally
issued
by
urban
viii
and
there
is
much
food
for
reflection
in
the
fact
that
the
same
pope
who
punished
galileo
and
was
determined
that
the
inquisition
should
not
allow
the
world
to
believe
that
the
earth
revolves
about
the
sun
thus
solemnly
ordered
the
world
under
pain
of
damnation
to
believe
in
xavier
miracles
including
his
gift
of
tongues
and
the
return
of
the
crucifix
by
the
pious
crab
but
the
legend
was
developed
still
further
father
bouhours
tells
us
the
holy
man
spoke
very
well
the
language
of
those
barbarians
without
having
learned
it
and
had
no
need
of
an
interpreter
when
he
instructed
and
finally
in
our
own
time
the
rev
father
coleridge
speaking
of
the
saint
among
the
natives
says
he
could
speak
the
language
excellently
though
he
had
never
learned
it
in
the
early
biography
tursellinus
writes
nothing
was
a
greater
impediment
to
him
than
his
ignorance
of
the
japanese
tongues
for
ever
and
anon
when
some
uncouth
expression
offended
their
fastidious
and
delicate
ears
the
awkward
speech
of
francis
was
a
cause
of
laughter
but
father
bouhours
a
century
later
writing
of
xavier
at
the
same
period
says
he
preached
in
the
afternoon
to
the
japanese
in
their
language
but
so
naturally
and
with
so
much
ease
that
he
could
not
be
taken
for
a
foreigner
and
finally
in
father
coleridge
of
the
society
of
jesus
speaking
of
xavier
at
this
time
says
he
spoke
freely
flowingly
elegantly
as
if
he
had
lived
in
japan
all
his
life
nor
was
even
this
sufficient
to
make
the
legend
complete
it
was
finally
declared
that
when
xavier
addressed
the
natives
of
various
tribes
each
heard
the
sermon
in
his
own
language
in
which
he
was
born
all
this
as
we
have
seen
directly
contradicts
not
only
the
plain
statements
of
xavier
himself
and
various
incidental
testimonies
in
the
letters
of
his
associates
but
the
explicit
declaration
of
father
joseph
acosta
the
latter
historian
dwells
especially
on
the
labour
which
xavier
was
obliged
to
bestow
on
the
study
of
the
japanese
and
other
languages
and
says
even
if
he
had
been
endowed
with
the
apostolic
gift
of
tongues
he
could
not
have
spread
more
widely
the
glory
of
christ

it
is
hardly

to

to

generally
a
conscious
attempt
to
deceive
the
simple

is
that
as

they

wrote
in
obedience
to
the
natural
laws
which
govern
the
luxuriant
growth
of

warm
atmosphere

and

constantly

leaders
in
times
when

have
little
or
no
knowledge
of

law
when
there
is
little
care
for

evidence
and
when
he
who
believes
most
is
thought
most
meritorious
instances
can
be
given
of
the
same
evolution
of
miraculous
legend
in
our
own
time
to
say
nothing
of
the
sacred
fountain
at
la
salette
which
preserves
its
healing
powers
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
miracle
that
gave
rise
to
them
has
twice
been
pronounced
fraudulent
by
the
french
courts
and
to
pass
without
notice
a
multitude
of
others
not
only
in
catholic
but
in
protestant
countries
the
present
writer
may
allude
to
one
which
in
the
year
came
under
his
own
observation
on
arriving
in
petersburg
to
begin
an
official
residence
there
his
attention
was
arrested
by
various
portraits
of
a
priest
of
the
church
they
were
displayed
in
shop
windows
and
held
an
honoured
place
in
many
private
dwellings
these
portraits
ranged
from
lifelike
photographs
which
showed
a
plain
shrewd
kindly
face
to
those
which
were
idealized
until
they
bore
a
strong
resemblance
to
the
conventional
representations
of
jesus
of
nazareth
on
making
inquiries
the
writer
found
that
these
portraits
represented
father
ivan
of
cronstadt
a
priest
noted
for
his
good
works
and
very
widely
believed
to
be
endowed
with
the
power
of
working
miracles
one
day
in
one
of
the
most
brilliant
reception
rooms
of
the
northern
capital
the
subject
of
father
ivan
miracles
having
been
introduced
a
gentleman
in
very
high
social
position
and
entirely
trustworthy
spoke
as
follows
there
is
something
very
surprising
about
these
miracles
i
am
slow
to
believe
in
them
but
i
know
the
following
to
be
a
fact
the
late
metropolitan
archbishop
of
petersburg
loved
quiet
and
was
very
adverse
to
anything
which
could
possibly
cause
scandal
hearing
of
father
ivan
miracles
he
summoned
him
to
his
presence
and
solemnly
commanded
him
to
abstain
from
all
of
the
things
which
had
given
rise
to
his
reported
miracles
and
with
this
injunction
dismissed
him
hardly
had
the
priest
left
the
room
when
the
archbishop
was
struck
with
blindness
and
remained
in
this
condition
until
the
priest
returned
and
removed
his
blindness
by
intercessory
prayers
when
the
present
writer
asked
the
person
giving
this
account
if
he
directly
knew
these
facts
he
replied
that
he
was
of
course
not
present
when
the
miracle
was
wrought
but
that
he
had
the
facts
immediately
from
persons
who
knew
all
the
parties
concerned
and
were
cognizant
directly
of
the
circumstances
of
the
case
some
time
afterward
the
present
writer
being
at
an
afternoon
reception
at
one
of
the
greater
embassies
the
same
subject
was
touched
upon
when
an
eminent
general
spoke
as
follows
i
am
not
inclined
to
believe
in
miracles
in
fact
am
rather
sceptical
but
the
proofs
of
those
wrought
by
father
ivan
are
overwhelming
he
then
went
on
to
say
that
the
late
metropolitan
archbishop
was
a
man
who
loved
quiet
and
disliked
scandal
and
that
on
this
account
he
had
summoned
father
ivan
to
his
palace
and
ordered
him
to
put
an
end
to
the
conduct
which
had
caused
the
reports
concerning
his
miraculous
powers
and
then
with
a
wave
of
the
arm
had
dismissed
him
the
priest
left
the
room
and
from
that
moment
the
archbishop
arm
was
paralyzed
and
it
remained
so
until
the
penitent
prelate
summoned
the
priest
again
by
whose
prayers
the
arm
was
restored
to
its
former
usefulness
there
was
present
at
the
time
another
person
besides
the
writer
who
had
heard
the
previous
statement
as
to
the
blindness
of
the
archbishop
and
on
their
both
questioning
the
general
if
he
were
sure
that
the
archbishop
arm
was
paralyzed
as
stated
he
declared
that
he
could
not
doubt
it
as
he
had
it
directly
from
persons
entirely
trustworthy
who
were
cognizant
of
all
the
facts
some
time
later
the
present
writer
having
an
interview
with
the
most
eminent
lay
authority
in
the
greek
church
a
functionary
whose
duties
had
brought
him
into
almost
daily
contact
with
the
late
archbishop
asked
him
which
of
these
stories
was
correct
this
gentleman
answered
immediately
neither
i
saw
the
archbishop
constantly
and
no
such
event
occurred
he
was
never
paralyzed
and
never
blind
the
same
gentleman
went
on
to
say
that
in
his
belief
father
ivan
had
shown
remarkable
powers
in
healing
the
sick
and
the
greatest
charity
in
relieving
the
distressed
it
was
made
clearly
evident
that
father
ivan
is
a
saintlike
man
devoted
to
the
needy
and
distressed
and
exercising
an
enormous
influence
over
them
an
influence
so
great
that
crowds
await
him
whenever
he
visits
the
capital
in
the
atmosphere
of
russian
devotion
myths
and
legends
grow
luxuriantly
about
him
nor
is
belief
in
him
confined
to
the
peasant
class
in
the
autumn
of
he
was
summoned
to
the
bedside
of
the
emperor
alexander
iii
unfortunately
for
the
peace
of
europe
his
intercession
at
that
time
proved
unavailing
these
examples
will
serve
to
illustrate
the
process
which
in
thousands
of
cases
has
gone
on
from
the
earliest
days
of
the
church
until
a
very
recent
period
everywhere
miraculous
cures
became
the
rule
rather
than
the
exception
throughout
christendom
iii
the
mediaeval
miracles
of
healing
check
medical
science
so
it
was
that
throughout
antiquity
during
the
early
history
of
the
church
throughout
the
middle
ages
and
indeed
down
to
a
comparatively
recent
period
testimony
to
miraculous
interpositions
which
would
now
be
laughed
at
by
a
schoolboy
was
accepted
by
the
leaders
of
thought
augustine
was
certainly
one
of
the
strongest
minds
in
the
early
church
and
yet
we
find
him
mentioning
with
much
seriousness
a
story
that
sundry
innkeepers
of
his
time
put
a
drug
into
cheese
which
metamorphosed
travellers
into
domestic
animals
and
asserting
that
the
peacock
is
so
favoured
by
the
almighty
that
its
flesh
will
not
decay
and
that
he
has
tested
it
and
knows
this
to
be
a
fact
with
such
a
disposition
regarding
the
wildest
stories
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
assertion
of
gregory
of
nazianzen
during
the
second
century
as
to
the
cures
wrought
by
the
martyrs
cosmo
and
damian
was
echoed
from
all
parts
of
europe
until
every
hamlet
had
its
saint
or
relic
the
literature
of
these
miracles
is
simply
endless
to
take
our
own
ancestors
alone
no
one
can
read
the
ecclesiastical
history
of
bede
or
abbot
samson
miracles
of
edmund
or
the
accounts
given
by
eadmer
and
osbern
of
the
miracles
of
dunstan
or
the
long
lists
of
those
wrought
by
thomas
a
becket
or
by
any
other
in
the
army
of
english
saints
without
seeing
the
perfect
naturalness
of
this
growth
this
evolution
of
miracle
in
all
parts
of
europe
came
out
of
a
vast
preceding
series
of
beliefs
extending
not
merely
through
the
early
church
but
far
back
into
paganism
just
as
formerly
patients
were
cured
in
the
temples
of
aesculapius
so
they
were
cured
in
the
middle
ages
and
so
they
are
cured
now
at
the
shrines
of
saints
just
as
the
ancient
miracles
were
solemnly
attested
by
votive
tablets
giving
names
dates
and
details
and
these
tablets
hung
before
the
images
of
the
gods
so
the
medieval
miracles
were
attested
by
similar
tablets
hung
before
the
images
of
the
saints
and
so
they
are
attested
by
similar
tablets
hung
before
the
images
of
our
lady
of
la
salette
or
of
lourdes
just
as
faith
in
such
miracles
persisted
in
spite
of
the
small
percentage
of
cures
at
those
ancient
places
of
healing
so
faith
persists
despite
the
fact
that
in
at
least
ninety
per
cent
of
the
cases
at
lourdes
prayers
prove
unavailing
as
a
rule
the
miracles
of
the
sacred
books
were
taken
as
models
and
each
of
those
given
by
the
sacred
chroniclers
was
repeated
during
the
early
ages
of
the
church
and
through
the
medieval
period
with
endless
variations
of
circumstance
but
still
with
curious
fidelity
to
the
original
type
it
should
be
especially
kept
in
mind
that
while
the
vast
majority
of
these
were
doubtless
due
to
the
faculty
and
to
that
development
of
legends
which
always
goes
on
in
ages
ignorant
of
the
relation
between
physical
causes
and
effects
some
of
the
miracles
of
healing
had
undoubtedly
some
basis
in
fact
we
in
modern
times
have
seen
too
many
cures
performed
through
influences
exercised
upon
the
imagination
such
as
those
of
the
jansenists
at
the
cemetery
of
medard
of
the
ultramontanes
at
la
salette
and
lourdes
of
the
russian
father
ivan
at
petersburg
and
of
various
protestant
sects
at
old
orchard
and
elsewhere
as
well
as
at
sundry
camp
meetings
to
doubt
that
some
cures
more
or
less
permanent
were
wrought
by
sainted
personages
in
the
early
church
and
throughout
the
middle
ages

medical
view
of
the
miracles
at

in

century
for

but
miraculous
cures
were
not
ascribed
to
persons
merely
another
growth
developed
by
the
early
church
mainly
from
germs
in
our
sacred
books
took
shape
in
miracles
wrought
by
streams
by
pools
of
water
and
especially
by
relics
here
too
the
old
types
persisted
and
just
as
we
find
holy
and
healing
wells
pools
and
streams
in
all
other
ancient
religions
so
we
find
in
the
evolution
of
our
own
such
examples
as
naaman
the
syrian
cured
of
leprosy
by
bathing
in
the
river
jordan
the
blind
man
restored
to
sight
by
washing
in
the
pool
of
siloam
and
the
healing
of
those
who
touched
the
bones
of
elisha
the
shadow
of
peter
or
the
handkerchief
of
paul
cyril
ambrose
augustine
and
other
great
fathers
of
the
early
church
sanctioned
the
belief
that
similar
efficacy
was
to
be
found
in
the
relics
of
the
saints
of
their
time
hence
ambrose
declared
that
the
precepts
of
medicine
are
contrary
to
celestial
science
watching
and
prayer
and
we
find
this
statement
reiterated
from
time
to
time
throughout
the
middle
ages
from
this
idea
was
evolved
that
fetichism
which
we
shall
see
for
ages
standing
in
the
way
of
medical
science
theology
developed
in
accordance
with
this
idea
threw
about
all
cures
even
those
which
resulted
from
scientific
effort
an
atmosphere
of
supernaturalism
the
vividness
with
which
the
accounts
of
miracles
in
the
sacred
books
were
realized
in
the
early
church
continued
the
idea
of
miraculous
intervention
throughout
the
middle
ages
the
testimony
of
the
great
fathers
of
the
church
to
the
continuance
of
miracles
is
overwhelming
but
everything
shows
that
they
so
fully
expected
miracles
on
the
slightest
occasion
as
to
require
nothing
which
in
these
days
would
be
regarded
as
adequate
evidence
in
this
atmosphere
of
theologic
thought
medical
science
was
at
once
checked
the
school
of
alexandria
under
the
influence
first
of
jews
and
later
of
christians
both
permeated
with
oriental
ideas
and
taking
into
their
theory
of
medicine
demons
and
miracles
soon
enveloped
everything
in
mysticism
in
the
byzantine
empire
of
the
east
the
same
cause
produced
the
same
effect
the
evolution
of
ascertained
truth
in
medicine
begun
by
hippocrates
and
continued
by
herophilus
seemed
lost
forever
medical
science
trying
to
advance
was
like
a
ship
becalmed
in
the
sargasso
sea
both
the
atmosphere
about
it
and
the
medium
through
which
it
must
move
resisted
all
progress
instead
of
reliance
upon
observation
experience
experiment
and
thought
attention
was
turned
toward
supernatural
agencies

checks
scientific
effort
especially
prejudicial
to
a
true
development
of
medical
science
among
the
first
christians
was
their
attribution
of
disease
to
diabolic
influence
as
we
have
seen
this
idea
had
come
from
far
and
having
prevailed
in
chaldea
egypt
and
persia
had
naturally
entered
into
the
sacred
books
of
the
hebrews
moreover
paul
had
distinctly
declared
that
the
gods
of
the
heathen
were
devils
and
everywhere
the
early
christians
saw
in
disease
the
malignant
work
of
these
dethroned
powers
of
evil
the
gnostic
and
manichaean
struggles
had
ripened
the
theologic
idea
that
although
at
times
diseases
are
punishments
by
the
almighty
the
main
agency
in
them
is
satanic
the
great
fathers
and
renowned
leaders
of
the
early
church
accepted
and
strengthened
this
idea

said
it
is
demons
which
produce

they
hover

the
heathen
offer
to
them
as

all
diseases
of

are
to
be
ascribed
to
these
demons

do
they

are
provoked
by

and
that

are
useless
but
that
they
are
often
cured
by
the
laying
on
of
consecrated
hands
nilus
and
gregory

ambrose
gave
examples
to
show
the
sinfulness
of
resorting
to

instead
of
trusting

bernard
in
a
letter
to

monks
warned
them
that
to
seek
relief
from
disease
in
medicine
was
in
harmony
neither
with
their
religion
nor
with
the
honour
and
purity
of
their

view
even
found
its
way
into
the

which
declared
the

contrary
to
divine
knowledge
as
a
rule
the

the

powerful
not
only
through
the
middle
ages
but
even
in
modern
times
both
among
catholics
and
protestants
as
to
its
results
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
while
there
is
no
need
to
attribute
the
mass
of
stories
regarding
miraculous
cures
to
conscious
fraud
there
was
without
doubt
at
a
later
period
no
small
admixture
of
belief
biased
by
with
much
pious
invention
and
suppression
of
facts
enormous
revenues
flowed
into
various
monasteries
and
churches
in
all
parts
of
europe
from
relics
noted
for
their
healing
powers
every
cathedral
every
great
abbey
and
nearly
every
parish
church
claimed
possession
of
healing
relics
while
undoubtedly
a
childlike
faith
was
at
the
bottom
of
this
belief
there
came
out
of
it
unquestionably
a
great
development
of
the
mercantile
spirit
the
commercial
value
of
sundry
relics
was
often
very
high
in
the
year
a
french
ruler
pledged
securities
to
the
amount
of
ten
thousand
solidi
for
the
production
of
the
relics
of
just
and
pastor
pending
a
legal
decision
regarding
the
ownership
between
him
and
the
archbishop
of
narbonne
the
emperor
of
germany
on
one
occasion
demanded
as
a
sufficient
pledge
for
the
establishment
of
a
city
market
the
arm
of
george
the
body
of
sebastian
brought
enormous
wealth
to
the
abbey
of
soissons
rome
canterbury
treves
marburg
every
great
city
drew
large
revenues
from
similar
sources
and
the
venetian
republic
ventured
very
considerable
sums
in
the
purchase
of
relics
naturally
then
corporations
whether
lay
or
ecclesiastical
which
drew
large
revenue
from
relics
looked
with
little
favour
on
a
science
which
tended
to
discredit
their
investments
nowhere
perhaps
in
europe
can
the
philosophy
of
this
development
of
fetichism
be
better
studied
than
at
cologne
at
the
cathedral
preserved
in
a
magnificent
shrine
since
about
the
twelfth
century
are
the
skulls
of
the
three
kings
or
wise
men
of
the
east
who
guided
by
the
star
of
bethlehem
brought
gifts
to
the
saviour
these
relics
were
an
enormous
source
of
wealth
to
the
cathedral
chapter
during
many
centuries
but
other
ecclesiastical
bodies
in
that
city
were
both
pious
and
shrewd
and
so
we
find
that
not
far
off
at
the
church
of
gereon
a
cemetery
has
been
dug
up
and
the
bones
distributed
over
the
walls
as
the
relics
of
gereon
and
his
theban
band
of
martyrs
again
at
the
neighbouring
church
of
ursula
we
have
the
later
spoils
of
another
cemetery
covering
the
interior
walls
of
the
church
as
the
bones
of
ursula
and
her
eleven
thousand
virgin
martyrs
the
fact
that
many
of
them
as
anatomists
now
declare
are
the
bones
of
men
does
not
appear
in
the
middle
ages
to
have
diminished
their
power
of
competing
with
the
relics
at
the
other
shrines
in
healing
efficiency
no
error
in
the
choice
of
these
healing
means
seems
to
have
diminished
their
efficacy
when
buckland
the
eminent
osteologist
and
geologist
discovered
that
the
relics
of
rosalia
at
palermo
which
had
for
ages
cured
diseases
and
warded
off
epidemics
were
the
bones
of
a
goat
this
fact
caused
not
the
slightest
diminution
in
their
miraculous
power
other
developments
of
fetich
cure
were
no
less
discouraging
to
the
evolution
of
medical
science
very
important
among
these
was
the
agnus
dei
or
piece
of
wax
from
the
paschal
candles
stamped
with
the
figure
of
a
lamb
and
consecrated
by
the
pope
in
pope
paul
ii
expatiated
to
the
church
on
the
efficacy
of
this
fetich
in
preserving
men
from
fire
shipwreck
tempest
lightning
and
hail
as
well
as
in
assisting
women
in
childbirth
and
he
reserved
to
himself
and
his
successors
the
manufacture
of
it
even
as
late
as
pope
leo
x
issued
for
a
consideration
tickets
bearing
a
cross
and
the
following
inscription
this
cross
measured
forty
times
makes
the
height
of
christ
in
his
humanity
he
who
kisses
it
is
preserved
for
seven
days
from
apoplexy
and
sudden
death
naturally
the
belief
thus
sanctioned
by
successive
heads
of
the
church
infallible
in
all
teaching
regarding
faith
and
morals
created
a
demand
for
amulets
and
charms
of
all
kinds
and
under
this
influence
we
find
a
reversion
to
old
pagan
fetiches
nothing
on
the
whole
stood
more
constantly
in
the
way
of
any
proper
development
of
medical
science
than
these
fetich
cures
whose
efficacy
was
based
on
theological
reasoning
and
sanctioned
by
ecclesiastical
policy
it
would
be
expecting
too
much
from
human
nature
to
imagine
that
pontiffs
who
derived
large
revenues
from
the
sale
of
the
agnus
dei
or
priests
who
derived
both
wealth
and
honours
from
cures
wrought
at
shrines
under
their
care
or
lay
dignitaries
who
had
invested
heavily
in
relics

theological
opposition
to

yet
a
more
serious
hindering
the
beginnings
of
modern
medicine
and
surgery
was
a
theory
regarding
the
unlawfulness
of
meddling
with
the
bodies
of
the
dead
this
theory
like
so
many
others
which
the
church
cherished
as
peculiarly
its
own
had
really
been
inherited
from
the
old
pagan
civilizations
so
strong
was
it
in
egypt
that
the
embalmer
was
regarded
as
accursed
traces
of
it
appear
in
life
and
hence
it
came
into
the
early
church
where
it
was
greatly
strengthened
by
the
addition
of
perhaps
the
most
noble
of
mystic
ideas
the
recognition
of
the
human
body
as
the
temple
of
the
holy
spirit
hence
tertullian
denounced
the
anatomist
herophilus
as
a
butcher
and
augustine
spoke
of
anatomists
generally
in
similar
terms
but
this
nobler
conception
was
alloyed
with
a
medieval
superstition
even
more
effective
when
the
formula
known
as
the
apostles
creed
had
in
its
teachings
regarding
the
resurrection
of
the
body
supplanted
the
doctrine
laid
down
by
paul
thence
came
a
dread
of
mutilating
the
body
in
such
a
way
that
some
injury
might
result
to
its
final
resurrection
at
the
last
day
and
additional
reasons
for
hindering
dissections
in
the
study
of
anatomy
to
these
arguments
against
dissection
was
now
added
another
one
which
may
well
fill
us
with
amazement
it
is
the
remark
of
the
foremost
of
recent
english
philosophical
historians
that
of
all
organizations
in
human
history
the
church
of
rome
has
caused
the
greatest
spilling
of
innocent
blood
no
one
conversant
with
history
even
though
he
admit
all
possible
extenuating
circumstances
and
honour
the
older
church
for
the
great
services
which
can
undoubtedly
be
claimed
for
her
can
deny
this
statement
strange
is
it
then
to
note
that
one
of
the
main
objections
developed
in
the
middle
ages
against
anatomical
studies
was
the
maxim
that
the
church
abhors
the
shedding
of
blood
on
this
ground
in
the
council
of
le
mans
forbade
surgery
to
monks
many
other
councils
did
the
same
and
at
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
came
the
most
serious
blow
of
all
for
then
it
was
that
pope
boniface
viii
without
any
of
that
foresight
of
consequences
which
might
well
have
been
expected
in
an
infallible
teacher
issued
a
decretal
forbidding
a
practice
which
had
come
into
use
during
the
crusades
namely
the
separation
of
the
flesh
from
the
bones
of
the
dead
whose
remains
it
was
desired
to
carry
back
to
their
own
country
the
idea
lying
at
the
bottom
of
this
interdiction
was
in
all
probability
that
which
had
inspired
tertullian
to
make
his
bitter
utterance
against
herophilus
but
be
that
as
it
may
it
soon
came
to
be
considered
as
extending
to
all
dissection
and
thereby
surgery
and
medicine
were
crippled
for
more
than
two
centuries
it
was
the
worst
blow
they
ever
received
for
it
impressed
upon
the
mind
of
the
church
the
belief
that
all
dissection
is
sacrilege
and
led
to
ecclesiastical
mandates
withdrawing
from
the
healing
art
the
most
thoughtful
and
cultivated
men
of
the
middle
ages
and
giving
up
surgery
to
the
lowest
class
of
nomadic
charlatans
so
deeply
was
this
idea
rooted
in
the
mind
of
the
universal
church
that
for
over
a
thousand
years
surgery
was
considered
dishonourable
the
greatest
monarchs
were
often
unable
to
secure
an
ordinary
surgical
operation
and
it
was
only
in
that
a
better
beginning
was
made
when
the
emperor
wenzel
of
germany
ordered
that
dishonour
should
no
longer
attach
to
the
surgical
profession
as
to
religious
scruples
against
dissection
and
abhorrence

paraschites

new
beginnings
of
medical
science
in
spite
of
all
these
opposing
forces
the
evolution
of
medical
science
continued
though
but
slowly
in
the
second
century
of
the
christian
era
galen
had
made
himself
a
great
authority
at
rome
and
from
rome
had
swayed
the
medical
science
of
the
world
his
genius
triumphed
over
the
defects
of
his
method
but
though
he
gave
a
powerful
impulse
to
medicine
his
dogmatism
stood
in
its
way
long
afterward
the
places
where
medicine
such
as
it
thus
became
could
be
applied
were
at
first
mainly
the
infirmaries
of
various
monasteries
especially
the
larger
ones
of
the
benedictine
order
these
were
frequently
developed
into
hospitals
many
monks
devoted
themselves
to
such
medical
studies
as
were
permitted
and
sundry
churchmen
and
laymen
did
much
to
secure
and
preserve
copies
of
ancient
medical
treatises
so
too
in
the
cathedral
schools
established
by
charlemagne
and
others
provision
was
generally
made
for
medical
teaching
but
all
this
instruction
whether
in
convents
or
schools
was
wretchedly
poor
it
consisted
not
in
developing
by
individual
thought
and
experiment
the
gifts
of
hippocrates
aristotle
and
galen
but
almost
entirely
in
the
repetition
of
their
writings
but
while
the
inherited
ideas
of
church
leaders
were
thus
unfavourable
to
any
proper
development
of
medical
science
there
were
two
bodies
of
men
outside
the
church
who
though
largely
fettered
by
superstition
were
far
less
so
than
the
monks
and
students
of
ecclesiastical
schools
these
were
the
jews
and
mohammedans
the
first
of
these
especially
had
inherited
many
useful
sanitary
and
hygienic
ideas
which
had
probably
been
first
evolved
by
the
egyptians
and
from
them
transmitted
to
the
modern
world
mainly
through
the
sacred
books
attributed
to
moses
the
jewish
scholars
became
especially
devoted
to
medical
science
to
them
is
largely
due
the
building
up
of
the
school
of
salerno
which
we
find
flourishing
in
the
tenth
century
judged
by
our
present
standards
its
work
was
poor
indeed
but
compared
with
other
medical
instruction
of
the
time
it
was
vastly
superior
it
developed
hygienic
principles
especially
and
brought
medicine
upon
a
higher
plane
still
more
important
is
the
rise
of
the
school
of
montpellier
this
was
due
almost
entirely
to
jewish
physicians
and
it
developed
medical
studies
to
a
yet
higher
point
doing
much
to
create
a
medical
profession
worthy
of
the
name
throughout
southern
europe
as
to
the
arabians
we
find
them
from
the
tenth
to
the
fourteenth
century
especially
in
spain
giving
much
thought
to
medicine
and
to
chemistry
as
subsidiary
to
it
about
the
beginning
of
the
ninth
century
when
the
greater
christian
writers
were
supporting
fetich
by
theology
almamon
the
moslem
declared
they
are
the
elect
of
god
his
best
and
most
useful
servants
whose
lives
are
devoted
to
the
improvement
of
their
rational
faculties
the
influence
of
avicenna
the
translator
of
the
works
of
aristotle
extended
throughout
all
europe
during
the
eleventh
century
the
arabians
were
indeed
much
fettered
by
tradition
in
medical
science
but
their
translations
of
hippocrates
and
galen
preserved
to
the
world
the
best
thus
far
developed
in
medicine
and
still
better
were
their
contributions
to
pharmacy

under

brought
together
in

centuries
under

power
a
science
indeed
alloyed
with

still
infolding

of

were

men
who

early
as

a

prepared

milo
archbishop

and
john

did
something
for

they
understood

unfortunately
they
generally
understood
its
theory
as
a
mixture
of
deductions
from
scripture
with
dogmas
from
galen
and
its
practice
as
a
mixture
of
incantations
with
fetiches
even
pope
honorius
iii
did
something
for
the
establishment
of
medical
schools
but
he
did
so
much
more
to
place
ecclesiastical
and
theological
fetters
upon
teachers
and
taught
that
the
value
of
his
gifts
may
well
be
doubted
all
germs
of
a
higher
evolution
of
medicine
were
for
ages
well
kept

the
theological
spirit
as
far
back
as
the
sixth
century
so
great
a
man
as
pope
gregory
i
showed
himself
hostile
to
the
development
of
this
science
in
the
beginning
of
the
twelfth
century
the
council
of
rheims
interdicted
the
study
of
law
and
physic
to
monks
and
a
multitude
of
other
councils
enforced
this
decree
about
the
middle
of
the
same
century
bernard
still
complained
that
monks
had
too
much
to
do
with
medicine
and
a
few
years
later
we
have
decretals
like
those
of
pope
alexander
iii
forbidding
monks
to
study
or
practise
it
for
many
generations
there
appear
evidences
of
a
desire
among
the
more
churchmen
to
allow
the
cultivation
of
medical
science
among
ecclesiastics
popes
like
clement
iii
and
sylvester
ii
seem
to
have
favoured
this
and
we
even
hear
of
an
archbishop
of
canterbury
skilled
in
medicine
but
in
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
the
fourth
council
of
the
lateran
forbade
surgical
operations
to
be
practised
by
priests
deacons
and
subdeacons
and
some
years
later
honorius
iii
reiterated
this
decree
and
extended
it
in
the
dominican
order
forbade
medical
treatises
to
be
brought
into
their
monasteries
and
finally
all
participation
of
ecclesiastics
in
the
science
and
art
of
medicine
was
effectually
prevented
for
statements
as

these
decrees

theological
discouragement
of

while
various
churchmen
building
better
than
they
knew
thus
did
something
to
lay
foundations
for
medical
study
the
church
authorities
as
a
rule
did
even
more
to
thwart
it
among
the
very
men
who
had
they
been
allowed
liberty
would
have
cultivated
it
to
the
highest
advantage
then
too
we
find
cropping
out
every
where
the
feeling
that
since
supernatural
means
are
so
abundant
there
is
something
irreligious
in
seeking
cure
by
natural
means
ever
and
anon
we
have
appeals
to
scripture
and
especially
to
the
case
of
king
asa
who
trusted
to
physicians
rather
than
to
the
priests
of
jahveh
and
so
died
hence
it
was
that
bernard
declared
that
monks
who
took
medicine
were
guilty
of
conduct
unbecoming
to
religion
even
the
school
of
salerno
was
held
in
aversion
by
multitudes
of
strict
churchmen
since
it
prescribed
rules
for
diet
thereby
indicating
a
belief
that
diseases
arise
from
natural
causes
and
not
from
the
malice
of
the
devil
moreover
in
the
medical
schools
hippocrates
was
studied
and
he
had
especially
declared
that
demoniacal
possession
is
nowise
more
divine
nowise
more
infernal
than
any
other
disease
hence
it
was
doubtless
that
the
lateran
council
about
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
forbade
physicians
under
pain
of
exclusion
from
the
church
to
undertake
medical
treatment
without
calling
in
ecclesiastical
advice
this
view
was
long
cherished
in
the
church
and
nearly
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
later
pope
pius
v
revived
it
by
renewing
the
command
of
pope
innocent
and
enforcing
it
with
penalties
not
only
did
pope
pius
order
that
all
physicians
before
administering
treatment
should
call
in
a
physician
of
the
soul
on
the
ground
as
he
declares
that
bodily
infirmity
frequently
arises
from
sin
but
he
ordered
that
if
at
the
end
of
three
days
the
patient
had
not
made
confession
to
a
priest
the
medical
man
should
cease
his
treatment
under
pain
of
being
deprived
of
his
right
to
practise
and
of
expulsion
from
the
faculty
if
he
were
a
professor
and
that
every
physician
and
professor
of
medicine
should
make
oath
that
he
was
strictly
fulfilling
these
conditions
out
of
this
feeling
had
grown
up
another
practice
which
made
the
development
of
medicine
still
more
difficult
the
classing
of
scientific
men
generally
with
sorcerers
and
from
this
largely
rose
the
charge
of
atheism
against
physicians
which
ripened
into
a
proverb
where
there
are
three
physicians
there
are
two
atheists

sylvester

was
at
once
suspected
of

when
he

charge
nearly
cost
the
life
of
constantine
africanus
when
he
broke
from
the
beaten
path
of
medicine
in

thirteenth
it
gave
roger
bacon
one
of
the
greatest
benefactors
of
mankind
many

brought

these
cases
are
typical
of
very
many
still
another
charge
against
physicians
who
showed
a
talent
for
investigation
was

monthly

the
effect
of
this
widespread
ecclesiastical
opposition
was
that
for
many
centuries
the
study
of
medicine
was
relegated
mainly
to
the
lowest
order
of
practitioners
there
was
indeed
one
orthodox
line
of
medical
evolution
during
the
later
middle
ages
thomas
aquinas
insisted
that
the
forces
of
the
body
are
independent
of
its
physical
organization
and
that
therefore
these
forces
are
to
be
studied
by
the
scholastic
philosophy
and
the
theological
method
instead
of
by
researches
into
the
structure
of
the
body
as
a
result
of
this
mingled
with
survivals
of
various
pagan
superstitions
we
have
in
anatomy
and
physiology
such
doctrines
as
the
increase

decrease
of
the
brain

as

with

the

that

was
that
of

this

amalgamation
of
theology
with
survivals
of
pagan
beliefs
continued
to
check
the
evolution
of
medical
science
down
to
the
modern
epoch
the
nominal
hostility
of
the
church
to
the
shedding
of
blood
withdrew
as
we
have
seen
from
surgical
practice
the
great
body
of
her
educated
men
hence
surgery
remained
down
to
the
fifteenth
century
a
despised
profession
its
practice
continued
largely
in
the
hands
of
charlatans
and
down
to
a
very
recent
period
the
name
was
a
survival
of

the
enormous
development
of
miracle
and
fetich
cures
in
the
church
continued
during
century
after
century
and
here
probably
lay
the
main
causes
of
hostility
between
the
church
on
the
one
hand
and
the
better
sort
of
physicians
on
the
other
namely
in
the
fact
that
the
church
supposed
herself
in
possession
of
something
far
better
than
scientific
methods
in
medicine
under
the
sway
of
this
belief
a
natural
and
laudable
veneration
for
the
relics
of

martyrs

fetichism

and
not
waste
his

in

or

a

attempted
by
causing
the

had

reality
of
fetich
cures
and
among
the
choice
stories
collected
by

jacques
de
vitry
for
the
use
of
preachers
was
one
which
judging
from
its
frequent
recurrence

must
have
sunk
deep
into
the
popular
mind
two
lazy
beggars
one
blind
the
other

try
to
avoid
the

of

borne
about

that
they
may

at

find
that
the
sick
were
cured
not
only
by
medicine
but
by
the
relics
of
matthew
and
others
human
nature
too
asserted
itself
then
as
now
by
making
various
pious
cures
fashionable
for
a
time
and
then
allowing
them
to
become
unfashionable
just
as
we
see
the
relics
of
cosmo
and
damian
in
great
vogue
during
the
early
middle
ages
but
out
of
fashion
and
without
efficacy
afterward
so
we
find
in
the
thirteenth
century
that
the
bones
of
louis
having
come
into
fashion
wrought
multitudes
of
cures
while
in
the
fourteenth
having
become
unfashionable
they
ceased
to
act
and
gave
place
for
a
time
to
the
relics
of
roch
of
montpellier
and
catherine
of
sienna
which
in
their
turn
wrought
many
cures
until
they
too
became
out
of
date
and
yielded
to
other
saints

so
in

the
healing
miracles
of

too
with
a
multitude

in

hardly
a
parish
has
not
had
one
such
sacred
centre
in
england

scotland
there
have
been
many
and
as
late
as
the
eminent
milner
of
the
roman
catholic
church
gave
a
careful
and
earnest
account
of
a
miraculous
cure
wrought
at
a
sacred
well
in
flintshire
in
all
parts
of
europe
the
pious
resort
to
wells
and
springs
continued
long
after
the
close
of
the
middle
ages
and
has
not
entirely
ceased
it
is
not
at
all
necessary
to
suppose
intentional
deception
in
the
origin
and
maintenance
of
all
fetich
cures
although
two
different
judicial
investigations
of
the
modern
miracles
at
la
salette
have
shown
their
origin
tainted
with
fraud
and
though
the
recent
restoration
of
the
cathedral
of
trondhjem
has
revealed
the
fact
that
the
healing
powers
of
the
sacred
spring
which
once
brought
such
great
revenues
to
that
shrine
were
assisted
by
angelic
voices
spoken
through
a
tube
in
the
walls
not
unlike
the
pious
machinery
discovered
in
the
temple
of
isis
at
pompeii
there
is
little
doubt
that
the
great
majority
of
fountain
and
even
shrine
cures
such
as
they
have
been
have
resulted
from
a
natural
law
and
that
belief
in
them
was
based
on
honest
argument
from
scripture
for
the
theological
argument
which
thus
stood
in
the
way
of
science
was
simply
this
if
the
almighty
saw
fit
to
raise
the
dead
man
who
touched
the
bones
of
elisha
why
should
he
not
restore
to
life
the
patient
who
touches
at
cologne
the
bones
of
the
wise
men
of
the
east
who
followed
the
star
of
the
nativity
if
naaman
was
cured
by
dipping
himself
in
the
waters
of
the
jordan
and
so
many
others
by
going
down
into
the
pool
of
siloam
why
should
not
men
still
be
cured
by
bathing
in
pools
which
men
equally
holy
with
elisha
have
consecrated
if
one
sick
man
was
restored
by
touching
the
garments
of
paul
why
should
not
another
sick
man
be
restored
by
touching
the
seamless
coat
of
christ
at
treves
or
the
of
christ
at
besancon
and
out
of
all
these
inquiries
came
inevitably
that
question
whose
logical
answer
was
especially
injurious
to
the
development
of
medical
science
why
should
men
seek
to
build
up
scientific
medicine
and
surgery
when
relics
pilgrimages
and
sacred
observances
according
to
an
overwhelming
mass

fetich
cures
under
the
royal
touch
the
reformation
made
no
sudden
change
in
the
sacred
theory
of
medicine
luther
as
is
well
known
again
and
again
ascribed
his
own
diseases
to
devils
spells
declaring
that
satan
produces
all
the
maladies
which
afflict
mankind
for
he
is
the
prince
of
death
and
that
he
poisons
the
air
but
that
no
malady
comes
from
god
from
that
day
down
to
the
faith
cures
of
boston
old
orchard
and
among
the
sect
of
peculiar
people
in
our
own
time
we
see
the
results
among
protestants
of
seeking
the
cause
of
disease
in
satanic
influence
and
its
cure
in
fetichism
yet
luther
with
his
sturdy
common
sense
broke
away
from
one
belief
which
has
interfered
with
the
evolution
of
medicine
from
the
dawn
of
christianity
until
now
when
that
troublesome
declaimer
carlstadt
declared
that
whoso
falls
sick
shall
use
no
physic
but
commit
his
case
to
god
praying
that
his
will
be
done
luther
asked
do
you
eat
when
you
are
hungry
and
the
answer
being
in
the
affirmative
he
continued
even
so
you
may
use
physic
which
is
god
gift
just
as
meat
and
drink
is
or
whatever
else
we
use
for
the
preservation
of
life
hence
it
was
doubtless
that
the
protestant
cities
of
germany
were
more
ready
than
others
to
admit
anatomical
investigation
by
proper
dissections
for
luther
belief

the
century
for
the
greater
readiness
of
protestant
cities
to
facilitate
dissections
see

andreas
vesalius
perhaps
the
development
of
a
theological
view
in
the
protestant
church
was
that
mainly
evolved
in
england
out
of
a
french
germ
of
theological
thought
a
belief
in
the
efficacy
of
the
royal
touch
in
sundry
diseases
especially
epilepsy
and
scrofula
the
latter
being
consequently
known
as
the
king
evil
this
mode
of
cure
began
so
far
as
history
throws
light
upon
it
with
edward
the
confessor
in
the
eleventh
century
and
came
down
from
reign
to
reign
passing
from
the
catholic
saint
to
protestant
debauchees
upon
the
english
throne
with
miraculous
efficacy
testimony
to
the
reality
of
these
cures
is
overwhelming
as
a
simple
matter
of
fact
there
are
no
miracles
of
healing
in
the
history
of
the
human
race
more
thoroughly
attested
than
those
wrought
by
the
touch
of
henry
viii
elizabeth
the
stuarts
and
especially
of
that
chosen
vessel
charles
ii
though
elizabeth
could
not
bring
herself
fully
to
believe
in
the
reality
of
these
cures
tooker
the
queen
chaplain
afterward
dean
of
lichfield
testifies
fully
of
his
own
knowledge
to
the
cures
wrought
by
her
as
also
does
william
clowes
the
queen
surgeon
fuller
in
his
church
history
gives
an
account
of
a
roman
catholic
who
was
thus
cured
by
the
queen
touch
and
converted
to
protestantism
similar
testimony
exists
as
to
cures
wrought
by
james
charles
i
also
enjoyed
the
same
power
in
spite
of
the
public
declaration
against
its
reality
by
parliament
in
one
case
the
king
saw
a
patient
in
the
crowd
too
far
off
to
be
touched
and
simply
said
god
bless
thee
and
grant
thee
thy
desire
whereupon
it
is
asserted
the
blotches
and
humours
disappeared
from
the
patient
body
and
appeared
in
the
bottle
of
medicine
which
he
held
in
his
hand
at
least
so
says
john
nicholas
warden
of
winchester
college
who
declares
this
of
his
own
knowledge
to
be
every
word
of
it
true
but
the
most
incontrovertible
evidence
of
this
miraculous
gift
is
found
in
the
case
of
charles
ii
the
most
thoroughly
cynical
debauchee
who
ever
sat
on
the
english
throne
before
the
advent
of
george
iv
he
touched
nearly
one
hundred
thousand
persons
and
the
outlay
for
gold
medals
issued
to
the
afflicted
on
these
occasions
rose
in
some
years
as
high
as
ten
thousand
pounds
john
brown
surgeon
in
ordinary
to
his
majesty
and
to
thomas
hospital
and
author
of
many
learned
works
on
surgery
and
anatomy
published
accounts
of
sixty
cures
due
to
the
touch
of
this
monarch
and
wiseman
devotes
an
entire
book
to
proving
the
reality
of
these
cures
saying
i
myself
have
been
frequent
witness
to
many
hundreds
of
cures
performed
by
his
touch
alone
without
any
assistance
of
chirurgery
and
these
many
of
them
had
tyred
out
the
endeavours
of
able
chirurgeons
before
they
came
thither
yet
it
is
especially
instructive
to
note
that
while
in
no
other
reign
were
so
many
people
touched
for
scrofula
and
in
none
were
so
many
cures
vouched
for
in
no
other
reign
did
so
many
people
die
of
that
disease
the
bills
of
mortality
show
this
clearly
and
the
reason
doubtless
is
the
general
substitution
of
supernatural
for
scientific
means
of
cure
this
is
but
one
out
of
many
examples
showing
the
havoc
which
a
scientific
test
always
makes
among
miracles
if
men
allow
it
to
be
applied
to
james
ii
the
same
power
continued
and
if
it
be
said
in
the
words
of
lord
bacon
that
imagination
is
next
of
kin
to
miracle
a
working
faith
something
else
seems
required
to
account
for
the
testimony
of
heylin
to
cures
wrought
by
the
royal
touch
upon
babes
in
their
mothers
arms
and
were
evidently
at
work
here
as
in
so
many
other
places
and
so
great
was
the
fame
of
these
cures
that
we
find
in
the
year
before
james
was
dethroned
a
pauper
at
portsmouth
new
hampshire
petitioning
the
general
assembly
to
enable
him
to
make
the
voyage
to
england
in
order
that
he
may
be
healed
by
the
royal
touch
the
change
in
the
royal
succession
does
not
seem
to
have
interfered
with
the
miracle
for
though
william
iii
evidently
regarded
the
whole
thing
as
a
superstition
and
on
one
occasion
is
said
to
have
touched
a
patient
saying
to
him
god
give
you
better
health
and
more
sense
whiston
assures
us
that
this
person
was
healed
notwithstanding
william
incredulity
as
to
queen
anne
daniel
turner
in
his
art
of
surgery
relates
that
several
cases
of
scrofula
which
had
been
unsuccessfully
treated
by
himself
and
charles
bernard
to
her
majesty
yielded
afterward
to
the
efficacy
of
the
queen
touch
naturally
does
collier
in
his
ecclesiastical
history
say
regarding
these
cases
that
to
dispute
them
is
to
come
to
the
extreme
of
scepticism
to
deny
our
senses
and
be
incredulous
even
to
ridiculousness
testimony
to
the
reality
of
these
cures
is
indeed
overwhelming
and
a
multitude
of
most
sober
scholars
divines
and
doctors
of
medicine
declared
the
evidence
absolutely
convincing
that
the
church
of
england
accepted
the
doctrine
of
the
royal
touch
is
witnessed
by
the
special
service
provided
in
the
of
that
period
for
occasions
when
the
king
exercised
this
gift
the
ceremony
was
conducted
with
great
solemnity
and
pomp
during
the
reading
of
the
service
and
the
laying
on
of
the
king
hands
the
attendant
bishop
or
priest
recited
the
words
they
shall
lay
their
hands
on
the
sick
and
they
shall
recover
afterward
came
special
prayers
the
epistle
and
gospel
with
the
blessing
and
finally
his
majesty
washed
his
royal
hands
in
golden
vessels
which
high
noblemen
held
for
him
in
france
too
the
royal
touch
continued
with
similar
testimony
to
its
efficacy
on
a
certain
easter
sunday
that
pious
king
louis
xiv
touched
about
sixteen
hundred
persons
at
versailles
this
curative
power
was
then
acknowledged
far
and
wide
by
catholics
and
protestants
alike
upon
the
continent
in
great
britain
and
in
america
and
it
descended
not
only
in
spite
of
the
transition
of
the
english
kings
from
catholicism
to
protestantism
but
in
spite
of
the
transition
from
the
legitimate
sovereignty
of
the
stuarts
to
the
illegitimate
succession
of
the
house
of
orange
and
yet
within
a
few
years
after
the
whole

held
this
belief
it
was

the
scientific
struggle
for
anatomy
we
may
now
take
up
the
evolution
of
medical
science
out
of
the
medieval
view
and
its
modern
survivals
all
through
the
middle
ages
as
we
have
seen
some
few
laymen
and
ecclesiastics
here
and
there
braving
the
edicts
of
the
church
and
popular
superstition
persisted
in
medical
study
and
practice
this
was
especially
seen
at
the
greater
universities
which
had
become
somewhat
emancipated
from
ecclesiastical
control
in
the
thirteenth
century
the
university
of
paris
gave
a
strong
impulse
to
the
teaching
of
medicine
and
in
that
and
the
following
century
we
begin
to
find
the
first
intelligible
reports
of
medical
cases
since
the
coming
in
of
christianity
in
the
thirteenth
century
also
the
of
the
papacy
the
emperor
frederick
ii
showed
his
tendencies
by
granting
from
time
to
time
permissions
to
dissect
the
human
subject
in
the
centuries
following
sundry
other
monarchs
timidly
followed
his
example
thus
john
of
aragon
in
gave
to
the
university
of
lerida
the
privilege
of
dissecting
one
dead
criminal
every
three
years
for
the
promotion
of
medical
science
and
practice
especially
in
the
thirteenth
century
by
the
universities
see
baas
pp
during
the
fifteenth
century
and
the
earlier
years
of
the
sixteenth
the
revival
of
learning
the
invention
of
printing
and
the
great
voyages
of
discovery
gave
a
new
impulse
to
thought
and
in
this
medical
science
shared
the
old
theological
way
of
thinking
was
greatly
questioned
and
gave
place
in
many
quarters
to
a
different
way
of
looking
at
the
universe
in
the
sixteenth
century
paracelsus
appears
a
great
genius
doing
much
to
develop
medicine
beyond
the
reach
of
sacred
and
scholastic
tradition
though
still
fettered
by
many
superstitions
more
and
more
in
spite
of
theological
dogmas
came
a
renewal
of
anatomical
studies
by
dissection
of
the
human
subject
the
practice
of
the
old
alexandrian
school
was
thus
resumed
mundinus
professor
of
medicine
at
bologna
early
in
the
fourteenth
century
dared
use
the
human
subject
occasionally
in
his
lectures
but
finally
came
a
far
greater
champion
of
scientific
truth
andreas
vesalius
founder
of
the
modern
science
of
anatomy
the
battle
waged
by
this
man
is
one
of
the
glories
of
our
race
from
the
outset
vesalius
proved
himself
a
master
in
the
search
for
real
knowledge
he
risked
the
most
terrible
dangers
and
especially
the
charge
of
sacrilege
founded
upon
the
teachings
of
the
church
for
ages
as
we
have
seen
even
such
men
in
the
early
church
as
tertullian
and
augustine
held
anatomy
in
abhorrence
and
the
decretal
of
pope
boniface
viii
was
universally
construed
as
forbidding
all
dissection
and
as
threatening
excommunication
against
those
practising
it
through
this
sacred
conventionalism
vesalius
broke
without
fear
despite
ecclesiastical
censure
great
opposition
in
his
own
profession
and
popular
fury
he
studied
his
science
by
the
only
method
that
could
give
useful
results
no
peril
daunted
him
to
secure
material
for
his
investigations
he
haunted
gibbets
and
braving
the
fires
of
the
inquisition
and
the
virus
of
the
plague
first
of
all
men
he
began
to
place
the
science
of
human
anatomy
on
its
solid
modern
foundations
on
careful
examination
and
observation
of
the
human
body
this
was
his
first
great
sin
and
it
was
soon
aggravated
by
one
considered
even
greater
perhaps
the
most
unfortunate
thing
that
has
ever
been
done
for
christianity
is
the
tying
it
to
forms
of
science
which
are
doomed
and
gradually
sinking
just
as
in
the
time
of
roger
bacon
excellent
men
devoted
all
their
energies
to
binding
christianity
to
aristotle
just
as
in
the
time
of
reuchlin
and
erasmus
they
insisted
on
binding
christianity
to
thomas
aquinas
so
in
the
time
of
vesalius
such
men
made
every
effort
to
link
christianity
to
galen
the
cry
has
been
the
same
in
all
ages
it
is
the
same
which
we
hear
in
this
age
for
curbing
scientific
studies
the
cry
for
what
is
called
sound
learning
whether
standing
for
aristotle
against
bacon
or
for
aquinas
against
erasmus
or
for
galen
against
vesalius
the
cry
is
always
for
sound
learning
the
idea
always
has
been
that
the
older
studies
are
safe
at
years
of
age
vesalius
gave
to
the
world
his
great
work
on
human
anatomy
with
it
ended
the
old
and
began
the
new
its
researches
by
their
thoroughness
were
a
triumph
of
science
its
illustrations
by
their
fidelity
were
a
triumph
of
art
to
shield
himself
as
far
as
possible
in
the
battle
which
he
foresaw
must
come
vesalius
dedicated
the
work
to
the
emperor
charles
v
and
in
his
preface
he
argues
for
his
method
and
against
the
parrot
repetitions
of
the
mediaeval
he
also
condemns
the
wretched
anatomical
preparations
and
specimens
made
by
physicians
who
utterly
refused
to
advance
beyond
the
ancient
master
the
repeaters
of
galen
gave
battle
at
once
after
the
manner
of
their
time
their
first
missiles
were
epithets
and
the
vast
arsenal
of
these
having
been
exhausted
they
began
to
use
sharper
weapons
weapons
theologic
in
this
case
there
were
especial
reasons
why
the
theological
authorities
felt
called
upon
to
intervene
first
there
was
the
old
idea
prevailing
in
the
church
that
the
dissection
of
the
human
body
is
forbidden
to
christians
this
was
used
with
great
force
against
vesalius
but
he
at
first
gained
a
temporary
victory
for
a
conference
of
divines
having
been
asked
to
decide
whether
dissection
of
the
human
body
is
sacrilege
gave
a
decision
in
the
negative
the
reason
was
simple
the
great
emperor
charles
v
had
made
vesalius
his
physician
and
could
not
spare
him
but
on
the
accession
of
philip
ii
to
the
throne
of
spain
and
the
netherlands
the
whole
scene
changed
vesalius
now
complained
that
in
spain
he
could
not
obtain
even
a
human
skull
for
his
anatomical
investigations
the
medical
and
theological
reactionists
had
their
way
and
to
all
appearance
they
have
as
a
rule
had
it
in
spain
ever
since
as
late
as
the
last
years
of
the
eighteenth
century
an
observant
english
traveller
found
that
there
were
no
dissections
before
medical
classes
in
the
spanish
universities
and
that
the
doctrine
of
the
circulation
of
the
blood
was
still
denied
more
than
a
century
and
a
half
after
sarpi
and
harvey
had
proved
it
another
theological
idea
barred
the
path
of
vesalius
throughout
the
middle
ages
it
was
believed
that
there
exists
in
man
a
bone
imponderable
incorruptible
incombustible
the
necessary
nucleus
of
the
resurrection
body
belief
in
a
resurrection
of
the
physical
body
despite
paul
epistle
to
the
corinthians
had
been
incorporated
into
the
formula
evolved
during
the
early
christian
centuries
and
known
as
the
apostles
creed
and
was
held
throughout
christendom
always
everywhere
and
by
all
this
hypothetical
bone
was
therefore
held
in
great
veneration
and
many
anatomists
sought
to
discover
it
but
vesalius
revealing
so
much
else
did
not
find
it
he
contented
himself
with
saying
that
he
left
the
question
regarding
the
existence
of
such
a
bone
to
the
theologians
he
could
not
lie
he
did
not
wish
to
fight
the
inquisition
and
thus
he
fell
under
suspicion
the
strength
of
this
theological
point
may
be
judged
from
the
fact
that
no
less
eminent
a
surgeon
than
riolan
consulted
the
executioner
to
find
out
whether
when
he
burned
a
criminal
all
the
parts
were
consumed
and
only
then
was
the
answer
received
which
fatally
undermined
this
superstition
yet
in
we
find
it
still
lingering
in
france
stimulating
opposition
in
the
church
to
dissection
even
as
late
as
the
eighteenth
century
bernouilli
having
shown
that
the
living
human
body
constantly
undergoes
a
series
of
changes
so
that
all
its
particles
are
renewed
in
a
given
number
of
years
so
much
ill
feeling
was
drawn
upon
him
from
theologians
who
saw
in
this
statement
danger
to
the
doctrine
of
the
resurrection
of
the
body
that
for
the
sake
of
peace
he
struck
out
his
argument
on
this
subject
from
his
collected
works

permissions

dissect

human
subject

was

by

that
the

still
other
encroachments
upon
the
theological
view
were
made
by
the
new
school
of
anatomists
and
especially
by
vesalius
during
the
middle
ages
there
had
been
developed
various
theological
doctrines
regarding
the
human
body
these
were
based
upon
arguments
showing
what
the
body
ought
to
be
and
naturally
when
anatomical
science
showed
what
it
is
these
doctrines
fell
an
example
of
such
popular
theological
reasoning
is
seen
in
a
widespread
belief
of
the
twelfth
century
that
during
the
year
in
which
the
cross
of
christ
was
captured
by
saladin
children
instead
of
having
thirty
or
teeth
as
before
had
twenty
or
so
too
in
vesalius
time
another
doctrine
of
this
sort
was
dominant
it
had
long
been
held
that
eve
having
been
made
by
the
almighty
from
a
rib
taken
out
of
adam
side
there
must
be
one
rib
fewer
on
one
side
of
every
man
than
on
the
other
this
creation
of
eve
was
a
favourite
subject
with
sculptors
and
painters
from
giotto
who
carved
it
upon
his
beautiful
campanile
at
florence
to
the
illuminators
of
missals
and
even
to
those
who
illustrated
bibles
and
religious
books
in
the
first
years
after
the
invention
of
printing
but
vesalius
and
the
anatomists
who
followed
him
put
an
end
among
thoughtful
men
to
this
belief
in
the
missing
rib
and
in
doing
this
dealt
a
blow
at
much
else
in
the
sacred
theory
naturally
all
these
considerations
brought
the
forces
of
ecclesiasticism
against
the
innovators
in
anatomy
as
to
the
supposed
change
in
the
number
of
teeth

apparently
undertaken

he
was
shipwrecked
and

and
strength
he
was
lost
to
the

yet
not
lost
in
this
century
a
great
painter
has
again
given
him
to
us

again

and
we
look
once
more
into
his
cell
its
windows

doors
bolted

barred
within
betoken
the
storm
of
bigotry
which
rages
without

spirit
in
which
he
labours

corpse

to
be

his
very
soul
seems
to
send
forth
rays
from
the
canvas
which
strengthen
us
for
the
good
fight
in
this
age
the
original
painting
of
vesalius
at
work
in
his
cell
by
hamann
is
now
at
cornell
university
his
death
was
hastened
if
not
caused
by
men
who
conscientiously
supposed
that
he
was
injuring
religion
his
poor
blind
foes
aided
in
destroying
one
of
religion
greatest
apostles
what
was
his
influence
on
religion
he
substituted
for
the
repetition
of
theories
a
conscientious
and
reverent
search
into
the
works
of
the
great
power
giving
life
to
the
universe
he
substituted
for
representations
of
the
human
structure
pitiful
and
unreal
representations
revealing
truths
most
helpful
to
the
whole
human
race
the
death
of
this
champion
seems
to
have
virtually
ended
the
contest
licenses
to
dissect
soon
began
to
be
given
by
sundry
popes
to
universities
and
were
renewed
at
intervals
of
from
three
to
four
years
until
the
reformation
set
in
motion
trains
of
thought
which
did
much
to
release
science
from
this
yoke

i
hasten
now
to
one
of
the
most
singular
struggles
of
medical
science
during
modern
times
early
in
the
last
century
boyer
presented
inoculation
as
a
preventive
of
smallpox
in
france
and
thoughtful
physicians
in
england
inspired
by
lady
montagu
and
maitland
followed
his
example
in
medicine
took
fright
at
once
on
both
sides
of
the
channel
and
theology
was
soon
finding
profound
reasons
against
the
new
practice
the
french
theologians
of
the
sorbonne
solemnly
condemned
it
the
english
theologians
were
most
loudly
represented
by
the
rev
edward
massey
who
in
preached
and
published
a
sermon
entitled
the
dangerous
and
sinful
practice
of
inoculation
in
this
he
declared
that
job
distemper
was
probably
confluent
smallpox
that
he
had
been
inoculated
doubtless
by
the
devil
that
diseases
are
sent
by
providence
for
the
punishment
of
sin
and
that
the
proposed
attempt
to
prevent
them
is
a
diabolical
operation
not
less
vigorous
was
the
sermon
of
the
rev
delafaye
entitled
inoculation
an
indefensible
practice
this
struggle
went
on
for
thirty
years
it
is
a
pleasure
to
note
some
churchmen
and
among
them
madox
bishop
of
worcester
giving
battle
on
the
side
of
right
reason
but
as
late
as
we
have
a
noted
rector
at
canterbury
denouncing
inoculation
from
his
pulpit
in
the
primatial
city
and
many
of
his
brethren
following
his
example
the
same
opposition
was
vigorous
in
protestant
scotland
a
large
body
of
ministers
joined
in
denouncing
the
new
practice
as
flying
in
the
face
of
providence
and
endeavouring
to
baffle
a
divine
judgment
on
our
own
side
of
the
ocean
also
this
question
had
to
be
fought
out
about
the
year
zabdiel
boylston
a
physician
in
boston
made
an
experiment
in
inoculation
one
of
his
first
subjects
being
his
own
son
he
at
once
encountered
bitter
hostility
so
that
the
selectmen
of
the
city
forbade
him
to
repeat
the
experiment
foremost
among
his
opponents
was
douglas
a
scotch
physician
supported
by
the
medical
profession
and
the
newspapers
the
violence
of
the
opposing
party
knew
no
bounds
they
insisted
that
inoculation
was
poisoning
and
they
urged
the
authorities
to
try
boylston
for
murder
having
thus
settled
his
case
for
this
world
they
proceeded
to
settle
it
for
the
next
insisting
that
for
a
man
to
infect
a
family
in
the
morning
with
smallpox
and
to
pray
to
god
in
the
evening
against
the
disease
is
blasphemy
that
the
smallpox
is
a
judgment
of
god
on
the
sins
of
the
people
and
that
to
avert
it
is
but
to
provoke
him
more
that
inoculation
is
an
encroachment
on
the
prerogatives
of
jehovah
whose
right
it
is
to
wound
and
smite
among
the
mass
of
scriptural
texts
most
remote
from
any
possible
bearing
on
the
subject
one
was
employed
which
was
equally
cogent
against
any
use
of
healing
means
in
any
disease
the
words
of
hosea
he
hath
torn
and
he
will
heal
us
he
hath
smitten
and
he
will
bind
us
up
so
bitter
was
this
opposition
that
boylston
life
was
in
danger
it
was
considered
unsafe
for
him
to
be
out
of
his
house
in
the
evening
a
lighted
grenade
was
even
thrown
into
the
house
of
cotton
mather
who
had
favoured
the
new
practice
and
had
sheltered
another
clergyman
who
had
submitted
himself
to
it
to
the
honour
of
the
puritan
clergy
of
new
england
it
should
be
said
that
many
of
them
were
boylston
strongest
supporters
increase
and
cotton
mather
had
been
among
the
first
to
move
in
favour
of
inoculation
the
latter
having
called
boylston
attention
to
it
and
at
the
very
crisis
of
affairs
six
of
the
leading
clergymen
of
boston
threw
their
influence
on
boylston
side
and
shared
the
obloquy
brought
upon
him
although
the
gainsayers
were
not
slow
to
fling
into
the
faces
of
the
mathers
their
action
regarding
witchcraft
urging
that
their
credulity
in
that
matter
argued
credulity
in
this
they
persevered
and
among
the
many
services
rendered
by
the
clergymen
of
new
england
to
their
country
this
ought
certainly
to
be
remembered
for
these
men
had
to
withstand
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
boylston
and
benjamin
franklin
the
same
weapons
which
were
hurled
at
the
supporters
of
inoculation
in
europe
charges
of
unfaithfulness
to
the
revealed
law
of
god
the
facts
were
soon
very
strong
against
the
gainsayers
within
a
year
or
two
after
the
first
experiment
nearly
three
hundred
persons
had
been
inoculated
by
boylston
in
boston
and
neighbouring
towns
and
out
of
these
only
six
had
died
whereas
during
the
same
period
out
of
nearly
six
thousand
persons
who
had
taken
smallpox
naturally
and
had
received
only
the
usual
medical
treatment
nearly
one
thousand
had
died
yet
even
here
the
gainsayers
did
not
despair
and
when
obliged
to
confess
the
success
of
inoculation
they
simply
fell
back
upon
a
new
argument
and
answered
it
was
good
that
satan
should
be
dispossessed
of
his
habitation
which
he
had
taken
up
in
men
in
our
lord
day
but
it
was
not
lawful
that
the
children
of
the
pharisees
should
cast
him
out
by
the
help
of
beelzebub
we
must
always
have
an
eye
to
the
matter
of
what
we
do
as
well
as
the
result
if
we
intend
to
keep
a
good
conscience
toward
god
but
the
facts
were
too
strong
the
new
practice
made
its
way
in
the
new
world
as
in
the
old

bitter
opposition
continued

no

too
sundry

survivals
of

caused
many
of

to
side

retrograde

most
virulent
of

enemies
was

of

was

called
on

to

the

number

deaths
from

terrible
scourge
was
amazing
in
berlin
during
the
eight
years

over
four
thousand
children

eight
years

adopted

larger
number
of

there
were
but
five

and
from

in

years

in

while

hundred
persons

sixteen

after

only

hundred
and
persons
died
of
it
throughout
all
denmark
in
vienna
where
the
average
yearly
mortality
from

had
been
over
eight
hundred
it
was

reduced

at

up

honoured

the

that

has
saved

now
saving
and

continue
to
save
in
all
coming
ages
more
lives
in
one
generation
than
were
destroyed
in
all
the
wars
of
napoleon
it
will
have
been
noticed
by
those
who
have
read
this
history
thus
far
that
the
record
of
the
church
generally
was
far
more
honourable
in
this
struggle
than
in
many
which
preceded
it
the
reason
is
not
difficult
to
find
the
decline
of
theology
enured
to
the
advantage
of
religion
and
religion
gave
powerful
aid
to
science
yet
there
have
remained
some
survivals
both
in
protestantism
and
in
catholicism
which
may
be
regarded
with
curiosity
a
small
body
of
perversely
ingenious
minds
in
the
medical
profession
in
england
have
found
a
few
ardent
allies
among
the
less
intellectual
clergy
the
rev
rothery
and
the
rev
allen
of
the
primitive
methodists
have
for
sundry
vague
theological
reasons
especially
distinguished
themselves
by
opposition
to
compulsory
vaccination
but
it
is
only
just
to
say
that
the
great
body
of
the
english
clergy
have
for
a
long
time
taken
the
better
view
far
more
painful
has
been
the
recent
history
of
the
other
great
branch
of
the
christian
church
a
history
developed
where
it
might
have
been
least
expected
the
recent
annals
of
the
world
hardly
present
a
more
striking
antithesis
between
religion
and
theology
on
the
religious
side
few
things
in
the
history
of
the
roman
church
have
been
more
beautiful
than
the
conduct
of
its
clergy
in
canada
during
the
great
outbreak
of
among
immigrants
at
montreal
about
the
middle
of
the
present
century
day
and
night
the
catholic
priesthood
of
that
city
ministered
fearlessly
to
those
victims
of
sanitary
ignorance
fear
of
suffering
and
death
could
not
drive
these
ministers
from
their
work
they
laid
down
their
lives
cheerfully
while
carrying
comfort
to
the
poorest
and
most
ignorant
of
our
kind
such
was
the
record
of
their
religion
but
in
a
record
was
made
by
their
theology
in
that
year
the
smallpox
broke
out
with
great
virulence
in
montreal
the
protestant
population
escaped
almost
entirely
by
vaccination
but
multitudes
of
their
catholic
under
some
vague
survival
of
the
old
orthodox
ideas
refused
vaccination
and
suffered
fearfully
when
at
last
the
plague
became
so
serious
that
travel
and
trade
fell
off
greatly
and
quarantine
began
to
be
established
in
neighbouring
cities
an
effort
was
made
to
enforce
compulsory
vaccination
the
result
was
that
large
numbers
of
the
catholic
working
population
resisted
and
even
threatened
bloodshed
the
clergy
at
first
tolerated
and
even
encouraged
this
conduct
the
abbe
filiatrault
priest
of
james
church
declared
in
a
sermon
that
if
we
are
afflicted
with
smallpox
it
is
because
we
had
a
carnival
last
winter
feasting
the
flesh
which
has
offended
the
lord
it
is
to
punish
our
pride
that
god
has
sent
us
smallpox
the
clerical
press
went
further
the
etendard
exhorted
the
faithful
to
take
up
arms
rather
than
submit
to
vaccination
and
at
least
one
of
the
secular
papers
was
forced
to
pander
to
the
same
sentiment
the
board
of
health
struggled
against
this
superstition
and
addressed
a
circular
to
the
catholic
clergy
imploring
them
to
recommend
vaccination
but
though
two
or
three
complied
with
this
request
the
great
majority
were
either
silent
or
openly
hostile
the
oblate
fathers
whose
church
was
situated
in
the
very
heart
of
the
infected
district
continued
to
denounce
vaccination
the
faithful
were
exhorted
to
rely
on
devotional
exercises
of
various
sorts
under
the
sanction
of
the
hierarchy
a
great
procession
was
ordered
with
a
solemn
appeal
to
the
virgin
and
the
use
of
the
rosary
was
carefully
specified
meantime
the
disease
which
had
nearly
died
out
among
the
protestants
raged
with
virulence
among
the
catholics
and
the
truth
becoming
more
and
more
clear
even
to
the
most
devout
proper
measures
were
at
last
enforced
and
the
plague
was
stayed
though
not
until
there
had
been
a
fearful
waste
of
life
among
these
believers
and
germs
of
scepticism
planted
in
the
hearts
of
their
children
which
will
bear
fruit
for
generations

come

another
class
of
cases
in
which
the
theologic
spirit
has
allied
itself
with
the
retrograde
party
in
medical
science
is
found
in
the
history
of
certain
remedial
agents
and
first
may
be
named
cocaine
as
early
as
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
value
of
coca
had
been
discovered
in
south
america
the
natives
of
peru
prized
it
highly
and
two
eminent
jesuits
joseph
acosta
and
antonio
julian
were
converted
to
this
view
but
the
conservative
spirit
in
the
church
was
too
strong
in
the
second
council
of
lima
consisting
of
bishops
from
all
parts
of
south
america
condemned
it
and
two
years
later
came
a
royal
decree
declaring
that
the
notions
entertained
by
the
natives
regarding
it
are
an
illusion
of
the
devil
as
a
pendant
to
this
singular
mistake
on
the
part
of
the
older
church
came
another
committed
by
many
protestants
in
the
early
years
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
jesuit
missionaries
in
south
america
learned
from
the
natives
the
value
of
the
peruvian
bark
in
the
treatment
of
ague
and
in
the
countess
of
cinchon
regent
of
peru
having
derived
great
benefit
from
the
new
remedy
it
was
introduced
into
europe
although
its
alkaloid
quinine
is
perhaps
the
nearest
approach
to
a
medical
specific
and
has
diminished
the
death
rate
in
certain
regions
to
an
amazing
extent
its
introduction
was
bitterly
opposed
by
many
conservative
members
of
the
medical
profession
and
in
this
opposition
large
numbers
of
joined
out
of
hostility
to
the
roman
church
in
the
heat
of
sectarian
feeling
the
new
remedy
was
stigmatized
as
an
invention
of
the
devil
and
so
strong
was
this
opposition
that
it
was
not
introduced
into
england
until
and
even
then
its
use
was
long
held
back
owing
mainly
to
feeling
what
the
theological
method
on
the
side
could
do
to
help
the
world
at
this
very
time
is
seen
in
the
fact
that
while
this
struggle
was
going
on
hoffmann
was
attempting
to
give
a
scientific
theory
of
the
action
of
the
devil
in
causing
job
boils
this
effort
at
a
explanation
which
should
satisfy
the
theological
spirit
comical
as
it
at
first
seems
is
really
worthy
of
serious
notice
because
it
must
be
considered
as
the
beginning
of
that
inevitable
effort
at
compromise
which
we
see
in
the
history
of
every
science
when
it
begins
to
appear
triumphant

the
opposition
of
the

i
pass
to
a
typical
conflict
in

and
in
a
protestant
country
in
james
young
simpson
a
scotch
physician
who
afterward
rose
to
the
highest
eminence
in
his
profession
having
advocated
the
use
of
anaesthetics
in
obstetrical
cases
was
immediately
met
by
a
storm
of
opposition
this
hostility
flowed
from
an
ancient
and
belief
in
scotland
as
far
back
as
the
year
eufame
macalyane
a
lady

view
persisted
even
to
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
from
pulpit
after
pulpit
simpson
use
of
chloroform
was
denounced
as
impious
and
contrary
to
holy
writ
texts
were
cited
abundantly
the
ordinary
declaration
being
that
to
use
chloroform
was
to
avoid
one
part
of
the
primeval
curse
on
woman
simpson
wrote
pamphlet
after
pamphlet
to
defend
the
blessing
which
he
brought
into
use
but
he
seemed
about
to
be
overcome
when
he
seized
a
new
weapon
probably
the
most
absurd
by
which
a
great
cause
was
ever
won
my
opponents
forget
he
said
the
verse
of
the
second
chapter
of
genesis
it
is
the
record
of
the
first
surgical
operation
ever
performed
and
that
text
proves
that
the
maker
of
the
universe
before
he
took
the
rib
from
adam
side
for
the
creation
of
eve
caused
a
deep
sleep
to
fall
upon
adam
this
was
a
stunning
blow
but
it
did
not
entirely
kill
the
opposition
they
had
strength
left
to
maintain
that
the
deep
sleep
of
adam
took
place
before
the
introduction
of
pain
into
the
world
in
a
state
of
innocence
but
now
a
new
champion
intervened
thomas
chalmers
with
a
few
pungent
arguments
from
his
pulpit
he
scattered
the
enemy
forever
and
the
greatest
battle
of
science
against
suffering
was
won
this
victory
was
won
not
less
for
religion
wisely
did
those
who
raised
the
monument
at
boston
to
one
of
the
discoverers
of
anaesthetics
inscribe
upon

pedestal
the
words

the
whole

view
rested
the

as

of

was

may
be
selected
as
indicating
the
drift
of
thought
among

themselves
toward

end
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
most
eminent
divines
of

branch
of

anglican
church

common
prayer
abounding
as
it
does
in
evidences
of
their
wisdom
and
piety
few
things
are
more
noteworthy
than
a
change
made
in
the
exhortation
to
the
faithful
to
present
themselves
at
the
communion
while
in
the
old
form
laid
down
in
the
english
prayer
book
the
minister
was
required
to
warn
his
flock
not
to
kindle
god
wrath
or
provoke
him
to
plague
us
with
divers
diseases
and
sundry
kinds
of
death
from
the
american
form
all
this
and
more
of
similar
import
in
various
services
was
left
out
since
that
day
progress
in
medical
science
has
been
rapid
indeed
and
at
no
period
more
so
than
during
the
last
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
theological
view
of
disease
has
steadily
faded
and
the
theological
hold
upon
medical
education
has
been
almost
entirely
relaxed
in
three
great
fields
especially
discoveries
have
been
made
which
have
done
much
to
disperse
the
atmosphere
of
miracle
first
there
has
come
knowledge
regarding
the
relation
between
imagination
and
medicine
which
though
still
defective
is
of
great
importance
this
relation
has
been
noted
during
the
whole
history
of
the
science
when
the
soldiers
of
the
prince
of
orange
at
the
siege
of
breda
in
were
dying
of
scurvy
by
scores
he
sent
to
the
physicians
two
or
three
small
vials
filled
with
a
decoction
of
camomile
wormwood
and
camphor
gave
out
that
it
was
a
very
rare
and
precious
medicine
a
medicine
of
such
virtue
that
two
or
three
drops
sufficed
to
impregnate
a
gallon
of
water
and
that
it
had
been
obtained
from
the
east
with
great
difficulty
and
danger
this
statement
made
with
much
solemnity
deeply
impressed
the
soldiers
they
took
the
medicine
eagerly
and
great
numbers
recovered
rapidly
again
two
centuries
later
young
humphry
davy
being
employed
to
apply
the
bulb
of
the
thermometer
to
the
tongues
of
certain
patients
at

after
they
had
inhaled
various
gases
as
remedies
for
disease
and
finding
that
the
patients
supposed
this
application
of
the
was
the
cure
finally
wrought
cures
by
this
application
alone
without
any
use
of
the
gases
whatever
innumerable
cases
of
this
sort
have
thrown
a
flood
of
light
upon
such
cures
as
those
wrought
by
prince
hohenlohe
by
the
metallic
tractors
and
by
a
multitude
of
other
agencies
temporarily
in
vogue
but
above
all
upon
the
miraculous
cures
which
in
past
ages
have
been
so
frequent
and
of
which
a
few
survive
the
second
department
is
that
of
hypnotism
within
the
last
many
scattered
indications
have
been
collected
and
supplemented
by
thoughtful
patient
investigators
of
genius
and
especially
by
braid
in
england
and
charcot
in
france
here
too
great
inroads
have
been
made
upon
the
province
hitherto
sacred
to
miracle
and
in
the
cathedral
preacher
steigenberger
of
augsburg
sounded
an
alarm
he
declared
his
fears
lest
accredited
church
miracles
lose
their
hold
upon
the
public
denounced
hypnotism
as
a
doctrine
of
demons
and
ended
with
the
singular
argument
that
inasmuch
as
hypnotism
is
avowedly
incapable
of
explaining
all
the
wonders
of
history
it
is
idle
to
consider
it
at
all
but
investigations
in
hypnotism
still
go
on
and
may
do
much
in
the
twentieth
century
to
carry
the
world
yet
further
from
the
realm
of
the
miraculous

a
third
field
science

won

striking

victories

prevailing

be
inscrutable

processes
involved
in

phenomena

tendency
to

the
feeling
of
joy
in
believing
in
summing
up
the
history
of
this
long
struggle
between
science
and
theology
two
main
facts
are
to
be
noted
first
that
in
proportion
as
the
world
approached
the
ages
of
faith
it
receded
from
ascertained
truth
and
in
proportion
as
the
world
has
receded
from
the
ages
of
faith
it
has
approached
ascertained
truth
secondly
that
in
proportion
as
the
grasp
of
theology
upon
education
tightened
medicine
declined
and
in
proportion
as
that
grasp
has
relaxed
medicine
has
been
developed
the
world
is
hardly
beyond
the
beginning
of
medical
discoveries
yet
they
have
already
taken
from
theology
what
was
formerly
its
strongest
province
sweeping
away
from
this
vast
field
of
human
effort
that
belief
in
miracles
which
for
more
than
twenty
centuries
has
been
the
main
in
the
path
of
medicine
and
in
doing
this
they
have
cleared
higher
paths
not
only
for
science
but
for
religion

the
rescue
of
medical

feature
in
recorded
history
has
been
the
recurrence
of
great
pestilences
various
indications
in
ancient
times
show
their
frequency
while
the
famous
description
of
the
plague
of
athens
given
by
thucydides
and
the
discussion
of
it
by
lucretius
exemplify
their
severity
in
the
middle
ages
they
raged
from
time
to
time
throughout
europe
such
plagues
as
the
black
death
and
the
sweating
sickness
swept
off
vast
multitudes
the
best
authorities
estimating
that
of
the
former
at
the
middle
of
the
fourteenth
century
more
than
half
the
population
of
england
died
and
that
millions
of
people
perished
in
various
parts
of
europe
in
thousand
patients
died
of
the
plague
at
paris
alone
and
in
more
than
twenty
thousand
the
great
plague
in
england
and
other
parts
of
europe
in
the
seventeenth
century
was
also
fearful
and
that
which
swept
the
south
of
europe
in
the
early
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
as
well
as
the
invasions
by
the
cholera
at
various
times
during
the
nineteenth
while
less
terrible
than
those
of
former
years
have
left
a
deep
impress
upon
the
imaginations
of
men
from
the
earliest
records
we
find
such
pestilences
attributed
to
the
wrath
or
malice
of
unseen
powers
this
had
been
the
prevailing
view
even
in
the
most
cultured
ages
before
the
establishment
of
christianity
in
greece
and
rome
especially
plagues
of
various
sorts
were
attributed
to
the
wrath
of
the
gods
in
judea
the
scriptural
records
of
various
plagues
sent
upon
the
earth
by
the
divine
fiat
as
a
punishment
for
sin
show
the
continuance
of
this
mode
of
thought
among
many
examples
and
intimations
of
this
in
our
sacred
literature
we
have
the
epidemic
which
carried
off
fourteen
thousand
seven
hundred
of
the
children
of
israel
and
which
was
only
stayed
by
the
prayers
and
offerings
of
aaron
the
high
priest
the
destruction
of
seventy
thousand
men
in
the
pestilence
by
which
king
david
was
punished
for
the
numbering
of
israel
and
which
was
only
stopped
when
the
wrath
of
jahveh
was
averted
by
the
plague
threatened
by
the
prophet
zechariah
and
that
delineated
in
the
apocalypse
from
these
sources
this
current
of
ideas
was
poured
into
the
early
christian
church
and
hence
it
has
been
that
during
nearly
twenty
centuries
since
the
rise
of
christianity
and
down
to
a
period
within
living
memory
at
the
appearance
of
any
pestilence
the
church
authorities
instead
of
devising
sanitary
measures
have
very
generally
preached
the
necessity
of
immediate
atonement
for
offences
against
the
almighty
this
view
of
the
early
church
was
enriched
greatly
by
a
new
development
of
theological
thought
regarding
the
powers
of
satan
and
evil
angels
the
declaration
of
paul
that
the
gods
of

moreover
comets
falling
stars
and
earthquakes
were
thought
upon
scriptural
authority
to
be
signs
and
wonders
evidences
of
the
divine
wrath
heralds
of
fearful
visitations
and
this
belief
acting
powerfully
upon
the
minds
of
millions
did
much
to
create
a
sure
to
increase
epidemic
disease
wherever
it
broke
forth
the
main
cause
of
this
immense
sacrifice
of
life
is
now
known
to
have
been
the
want
of
hygienic
precaution
both
in
the
eastern
centres
where
various
plagues
were
developed
and
in
the
european
towns
through
which
they
spread
and
here
certain
theological
reasonings
came
in
to
resist
the
evolution
of
a
proper
sanitary
theory
out
of
the
orient
had
been
poured
into
the
thinking
of
western
europe
the
theological
idea
that
the
abasement
of
man
adds
to
the
glory
of
god
that
indignity
to
the
body
may
secure
salvation
to
the
soul
hence
that
cleanliness
betokens
pride
and
filthiness
humility
living
in
filth
was
regarded
by
great
numbers
of
holy
men
who
set
an
example
to
the
church
and
to
society
as
an
evidence
of
sanctity
jerome
and
the
breviary
of
the
roman
church
dwell
with
unction
on
the
fact
that
hilarion
lived
his
whole
life
long
in
utter
physical
uncleanliness
athanasius
glorifies
anthony
because
he
had
never
washed
his
feet
abraham
most
striking
evidence
of
holiness
was
that
for
fifty
years
he
washed
neither
his
hands
nor

sylvia

washed
any
part
of
her
body
save
her

euphraxia

which
the

religiously
abstained
from
bathing
mary
of
egypt
was
eminent
for
filthiness
simnon
stylites
was
in
this
respect
unspeakable
the
least
that
can
be
said
is
that
he
lived
in
ordure
and
stench
intolerable
to
his
visitors
the
lives
of
the
saints
dwell
with
complacency
on
the
statement
that
when
sundry
eastern
monks
showed
a
disposition
to
wash
themselves
the
almighty
manifested
his
displeasure
by
drying
up
a
neighbouring
stream
until
the
bath
which
it
had
supplied
was
destroyed
the
religious
world
was
far
indeed
from
the
inspired
utterance
attributed
to
john
wesley
that
cleanliness
is
near
akin
to
godliness
for
century
after
century
the
idea
prevailed
that
filthiness
was
akin
to
holiness
and
while
we
may
well
believe
that
the
devotion
of
the
clergy
to
the
sick
was
one
cause
why
during
the
greater
plagues
they
lost
so
large
a
proportion
of
their
numbers
we
can
not
escape
the
conclusion
that
their
want
of
cleanliness
had
much
to
do
with
it
in
france
during
the
fourteenth
century
guy
de
chauliac
the
great
physician
of
his
time
noted
particularly
that
certain
carmelite
monks
suffered
especially
from
pestilence
and
that
they
were
especially
filthy
during
the
black
death
no
less
than
nine
hundred
carthusian
monks
fell
victims
in
one
group
of
buildings
naturally
such
an
example
set
by
the
venerated
leaders
of
thought
exercised
great
influence
throughout
society
and
all
the
more
because
it
justified
the
carelessness
and
sloth
to
which
ordinary
humanity
is
prone
in
the
principal
towns
of
europe
as
well
as
in
the
country
at
large
down
to
a
recent
period
the
most
ordinary
sanitary
precautions
were
neglected
and
pestilences
continued
to
be
attributed
to
the
wrath
of
god
or
the
malice
of
satan
as
to
the
wrath
of
god
a
new
and
powerful
impulse
was
given
to
this
belief
in
the
church
toward
the
end
of
the
sixth
century
by
gregory
the
great
in
when
he
was
elected
pope
the
city
of
rome
was
suffering
from
a
dreadful
pestilence
the
people
were
dying
by
thousands
out
of
one
procession
imploring
the
mercy
of
heaven
no
less
than
eighty
persons
died
within
an
hour
what
the
heathen
in
an
earlier
epoch
had
attributed
to
apollo
was
now
attributed
to
jehovah
and
chroniclers
tell
us
that
fiery
darts
were
seen
flung
from
heaven
into
the
devoted
city
but
finally
in
the
midst
of
all
this
horror
gregory
at
the
head
of
a
penitential
procession
saw
hovering
over
the
mausoleum
of
hadrian
the
figure
of
the
archangel
michael
who
was
just
sheathing
a
flaming
sword
while
three
angels
were
heard
chanting
the
regina
coeli
the
legend
continues
that
the
pope
immediately
broke
forth
into
hallelujahs
for
this
sign
that
the
plague
was
stayed
and
as
it
shortly
afterward
became
less
severe
a
chapel
was
built
at
the
summit
of
the
mausoleum
and
dedicated
to
michael
still
later
above
the
whole
was
erected
the
colossal
statue
of
the
archangel
sheathing
his
sword
which
still
stands
to
perpetuate
the
legend
thus
the
greatest
of
rome
ancient
funeral
monuments
was
made
to
bear
testimony
to
this
medieval
belief
the
mausoleum
of
hadrian
became
the
castle
of
angelo
a
legend
like
this
claiming
to
date
from
the
greatest
of
the
early
popes
and
vouched
for
by
such
an
imposing
monument
had
undoubtedly
a
marked
effect
upon
the
dominant
theology
throughout
europe
which
was
constantly
developing
a
great
body
of
thought
regarding
the
agencies
by
which
the
divine
wrath
might
be
averted
first
among
these
agencies
naturally
were
evidences
of
devotion
especially
gifts
of
land
money
or
privileges
to
churches
monasteries
and
shrines
the
seats
of
fetiches
which
it
was
supposed
had
wrought
cures
or
might
work
them
the
whole
evolution
of
modern
history
not
only
ecclesiastical
but
civil
has
been
largely
affected
by
the
wealth
transferred
to
the
clergy
at
such
periods
it
was
noted
that
in
the
fourteenth
century
after
the
great
plague
the
black
death
had
passed
an
immensely
increased
proportion
of
the
landed
and
personal
property
of
every
european
country
was

the
hands
of
the

very
noted

were
the

of

flagellants
trooping
through
various
parts

scourging
their

bodies
shrieking
the
penitential
psalms
and
often
running
from
wild
excesses
of
devotion
to
the
maddest
orgies
sometimes
too
plagues
were
attributed
to
the
wrath
of
lesser
heavenly
powers
just
as
in
former
times
the
fury
of
apollo
was
felt
when
his
name
was
not
respectfully
treated
by
mortals
so
in
the
church
authorities
at
rome
discovered
that
the
plague
then
raging
resulted
from
the
anger
of
sebastian
because
no
monument
had
been
erected
to
him
such
a
monument
was
therefore
placed
in
the
church
of
peter
ad
vincula
and
the
plague
ceased
so
much
for
the
endeavour
to
avert
the
wrath
of
the
heavenly
powers
on
the
other
hand
theological
reasoning
no
less
subtle
was
used
in
thwarting
the
malice
of
satan
this
idea
too
came
from
far
in
the
sacred
books
of
india
and
persia
as
well
as
in
our
own
we
find
the
same
theory
of
disease
leading
to
similar
means
of
cure
perhaps
the
most
astounding
among
christian
survivals
of
this
theory
and
its
resultant
practices
was
seen
during
the
plague
at
rome
in
in
that
year
at
that
centre
of
divine
illumination
certain
people
having
reasoned
upon
the
matter
came
to
the
conclusion
that
this
great
scourge
was
the
result
of
satanic
malice
and
in
view
of
paul
declaration
that
the
ancient
gods
were
devils
and
of
the
theory
that
the
ancient
gods
of
rome
were
the
devils
who
had
the
most
reason
to
punish
that
city
for
their
dethronement
and
that
the
great
amphitheatre
was
the
chosen
haunt
of
these
demon
gods
an
ox
decorated
with
garlands
after
the
ancient
heathen
manner
was
taken
in
procession
to
the
colosseum
and
solemnly
sacrificed
even
this
proved
vain
and
the
church
authorities
then
ordered
expiatory
processions
and
ceremonies
to
propitiate
the
almighty
the
virgin
and
the
saints
who
had
been
offended
by
this
temporary
effort
to
bribe
their
enemies
but
this
sort
of
theological
reasoning
developed
an
idea
far
more
disastrous
and
this
was
that
satan
in
causing
pestilences
used
as
his
emissaries
especially
jews
and
witches
the
proof
of
this
belief
in
the
case
of
the
jews
was
seen
in
the
fact
that
they
escaped
with
a
less
percentage
of
disease
than
did
the
christians
in
the
great
plague
periods
this
was
doubtless
due
in
some
measure
to
their
remarkable
sanitary
system
which
had
probably
originated
thousands
of
years
before
in
egypt
and
had
been
handed
down
through
jewish
lawgivers
and
statesmen
certainly
they
observed
more
careful
sanitary
rules
and
more
constant
abstinence
from
dangerous
foods
than
was
usual
among
christians
but
the
public
at
large
could
not
understand
so
simple
a
cause
and
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
their
immunity
resulted
from
protection
by
satan
and
that
this
protection
was
repaid
and
the
pestilence
caused
by
their
wholesale
poisoning
of
christians
as
a
result
of
this
mode
of
thought
attempts
were
made
in
all
parts
of
europe
to
propitiate
the
almighty
to
thwart
satan
and
to
stop
the
plague
by
torturing
and
murdering
the
jews
throughout
europe
during
great
pestilences
we
hear
of
extensive
burnings
of
this
devoted
people
in
bavaria
at
the
time
of
the
black
death
it
is
computed
that
twelve
thousand
jews
thus
perished
in
the
small
town
of
erfurt
the
number
is
said
to
have
been
three
thousand

castle
of

near

an
immense
trench
was
dug
filled
with
blazing
wood
and
in
a
single
day
one
hundred
and
sixty
jews
were
burned
everywhere
in

europe
this
mad
persecution
went
on
but
it
is
a
pleasure
to
say
that
one
great
churchman
pope
clement
vi
stood
against
this
popular
unreason

so
far
as
he
could
bring

appealed
to

during

passed

if

would

city

apparently
accepted
the
bargain

were

to
witches

believing
them
the

came

belief
too
had
been
poured
mainly
from

sources

thence
into

church

was
strengthened

the

subject
george
burr
paper
on
the
literature
of
witchcraft
read
before
the
american
historical
association
at
washington
in
germany
its
development
was
especially
terrible
from
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
to
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
catholic
and
protestant
theologians
and
ecclesiastics
vied
with
each
other
in
detecting
witches
guilty
of
producing
sickness
or
bad
weather
women
were
sent
to
torture
and
death
by
thousands
and
with
them
from
time
to
time
men
and
children
on
the
catholic
side
sufficient
warrant
for
this
work
was
found
in
the
bull
of
pope
innocent
viii
and
the
palaces
of
south
germany
became
shambles
the
lordly
prelates
of
salzburg
wurzburg
and
bamberg
taking
the
lead
in
this
butchery
in
north
germany
protestantism
was
just
as
conscientiously
cruel
it
based
its
theory
and
practice
toward
witches
directly
upon
the
bible
and
above
all
on
the
great
text
which
has
cost
the
lives
of
so
many
myriads
of
innocent
men
women
and
children
thou
shalt
not
suffer
a
witch
to
live
naturally
the
protestant
authorities
strove
to
show
that
protestantism
was
no
less
orthodox
in
this
respect
than
catholicism
and
such
theological
jurists
as
carpzov
damhouder
and
calov
did
their
work
thoroughly

eminent
authority
on
this
subject
estimates
the
number
of
victims
thus
sacrificed
during
that
century
in
germany
alone
at
over
a
hundred
thousand
among
the
methods
of
this
witch
activity
especially
credited
in
central
and
southern
europe
was
the
anointing
of
city
walls
and
pavements
with
a
diabolical
unguent
causing
pestilence
in
michael
caddo
was
executed
with
fearful
tortures
for
thus
besmearing
the
pavements
of
geneva
but
far
more
dreadful
was
the
torturing
to
death
of
a
large
body
of
people
at
milan
in
the
following
century
for
producing
the
plague
by
anointing
the
walls
and
a
little
later
similar
punishments
for
the
same
crime
were
administered
in
toulouse
and
other
cities
the
case
in
milan
may
be
briefly
summarized
as
showing
the
ideas
on
sanitary
science
of
all
classes
from
highest
to
lowest
in
the
seventeenth
century
that
city
was
then
under
the
control
of
spain
and
its
authorities
having
received
notice
from
the
spanish
government
that
certain
persons
suspected
of
witchcraft
had
recently
left
madrid
and
had
perhaps
gone
to
milan
to
anoint
the
walls
this
communication
was
dwelt
upon
in
the
pulpits
as
another
evidence
of
that
satanic
malice
which
the
church
alone
had
the
means
of
resisting
and
the
people
were
thus
excited
and
put
upon
the
alert
one
morning
in
the
year
an
old
woman
looking
out
of
her
window
saw
a
man
walking
along
the
street
and
wiping
his
fingers
upon
the
walls
she
immediately
called
the
attention
of
another
old
woman
and
they
agreed
that
this
man
must
be
one
of
the
diabolical
anointers
it
was
perfectly
evident
to
a
person
under
ordinary
conditions
that
this
unfortunate
man
was
simply
trying
to
remove
from
his
fingers
the
ink
gathered
while
writing
from
the
which
he
carried
in
his
girdle
but
this
explanation
was
too
simple
to
satisfy
those
who
first
observed
him
or
those
who
afterward
tried
him
a
mob
was
raised
and
he
was
thrown
into
prison
being
tortured
he
at
first
did
not
know
what
to
confess
but
on
inquiring
from
the
jailer
and
others
he
learned
what
the
charge
was
and
on
being
again
subjected
to
torture
utterly
beyond
endurance
he
confessed
everything
which
was
suggested
to
him
and
on
being
tortured
again
and
again
to
give
the
names
of
his
accomplices
he
accused
at
hazard
the
first
people
in
the
city
whom
he
thought
of
these
being
arrested
and
tortured
beyond
endurance
confessed
and
implicated
a
still
greater
number
until
members
of
the
foremost
families
were
included
in
the
charge
again
and
again
all
these
unfortunates
were
tortured
beyond
endurance
under
paganism
the
rule
regarding
torture
had
been
that
it
should
not
be
carried
beyond
human
endurance
and
we
therefore
find
cicero
ridiculing
it
as
a
means
of
detecting
crime
because
a
stalwart
criminal
of
strong
nerves
might
resist
it
and
go
free
while
a
physically
delicate
man
though
innocent
would
be
forced
to
confess
hence
it
was
that
under
paganism
a
limit
was
imposed
to
the
torture
which
could
be
administered
but
when
christianity
had
become
predominant
throughout
europe
torture
was
developed
with
a
cruelty
never
before
known
there
had
been
evolved
a
doctrine
of
excepted
cases
these
excepted
cases
being
especially
heresy
and
witchcraft
for
by
a
very
simple
and
logical
process
of
theological
reasoning
it
was
held
that
satan
would
give
supernatural
strength
to
his
special
devotees
that
is
to
heretics
and
witches
and
therefore
that
in
dealing
with
them
there
should
be
no
limit
to
the
torture
the
result
was
in
this
particular
case
as
in
tens
of
thousands
besides
that
the
accused
confessed
everything
which
could
be
suggested
to
them
and
often
in
the
delirium
of
their
agony
confessed
far
more
than
all
that
the
zeal
of
the
prosecutors
could
suggest
finally
a
great
number
of
worthy
people
were
sentenced
to
the
most
cruel
death
which
could
be
invented
the
records
of
their
trials
and
deaths
are
frightful
the
treatise
which
in
recent
years
has
first
brought
to
light
in
connected
form
an
authentic
account
of
the
proceedings
in
this
affair
and
which
gives
at
the
end
engravings
of
the
accused
subjected
to
horrible
tortures
on
their
way
to
the
stake
and
at
the
place
of
execution
itself
is
one
of
the
most
fearful
monuments
of
theological
reasoning
and
human
folly
to
cap
the
climax
after
a
poor
apothecary
had
been
tortured
into
a
confession
that
he
had
made
the
magic
ointment
and
when
he
had
been
put
to
death
with
the
most
exquisite
refinements
of
torture
his
family
were
obliged
to
take
another
name
and
were
driven
out
from
the
city
his
house
was
torn
down
and
on
its
site
was
erected
the
column
of
infamy
which
remained
on
this
spot
until
toward
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
a
party
of
young
radicals
probably
influenced
by
the
reading
of
beccaria
sallied
forth
one
night
and
leveled
this
pious
monument
to
the
ground
herein
was
seen
the
culmination
and
decline
of
the
bull
summis
desiderantes
it
had
been
issued
by
him
whom
a
majority
of
the
christian
world
believes
to
be
infallible
in
his
teachings
to
the
church
as
regards
faith
and
morals
yet
here
was
a
deliberate
utterance
in
a
matter
of
faith
and
morals
which
even
children
now
know
to
be
utterly
untrue
though
beccaria
book
on
crimes
and
punishments
with
its
declarations
against
torture
was
placed
by
the
church
authorities
upon
the
index
and
though
the
faithful
throughout
the
christian
world
were
forbidden
to
read
it
even
this
could
not
prevent
the
victory
of
truth
over
this
infallible
utterance
of
innocent

fearful
effects
of

and
following
as

seventeenth

went
on
ingenuity

a

curious

curious

the
theological
doctrine

executing
with
horrible
tortures
the
jews
heretics
and
witches
who
were
supposed
to
cause
the
pestilence
of
while
in
the
heavens
the
virgin
and
januarius
are
interceding
with
christ
to
sheathe
his
sword
and
stop
the
plague
in
such
an
atmosphere
of
thought
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
death
statistics
were
appalling
we
hear
of
districts
in
which
not
more
than
one
in
ten
escaped
and
some
were
entirely
depopulated
such
appeals
to
fetich
against
pestilence
have
continued
in
naples
down
to
our
own
time
the
great
saving
power
being
the
liquefaction
of
the
blood
of
januarius
in
the
present
writer
saw
this
miracle
performed
in
the
gorgeous
chapel
of
the
saint
forming
part
of
the
cathedral
of
naples
the
chapel
was
filled
with
devout
worshippers
of
every
class
from
the
officials
in
court
dress
representing
the
bourbon
king
down
to
the
lowest
lazzaroni
the
reliquary
of
shaped
like
a
large
human
head
and
supposed
to
contain
the
skull
of
the
saint
was
first
placed
upon
the
altar
next
two
vials
containing
a
dark
substance
said
to
be
his
blood
having
been
taken
from
the
wall
were
also
placed
upon
the
altar
near
the
head
as
the
priests
said
masses
they
turned
the
vials
from
time
to
time
and
the
liquefaction
being
somewhat
delayed
the
great
crowd
of
people
burst
out
into
more
and
more
impassioned
expostulation
and
petitions
to
the
saint
just
in
front
of
the
altar
were
the
lazzaroni
who
claimed
to
be
descendants
of
the
saint
family
and
these
were
especially
importunate
at
such
times
they
beg
they
scold
they
even
threaten
they
have
been
known
to
abuse
the
saint
roundly
and
to
tell
him
that
if
he
did
not
care
to
show
his
favour
to
the
city
by
liquefying
his
blood
cosmo
and
damian
were
just
as
good
saints
as
he
and
would
no
doubt
be
very
glad
to
have
the
city
devote
itself
to
them
at
last
on
the
occasion
above
referred
to
the
priest
turning
the
vials
suddenly
announced
that
the
saint
had
performed
the
miracle
and
instantly
priests
people
choir
and
organ
burst
forth
into
a
great
te
deum
bells
rang
and
cannon
roared
a
procession
was
formed
and
the
shrine
containing
the
saint
relics
was
carried
through
the
streets
the
people
prostrating
themselves
on
both
sides
of
the
way
and
throwing
showers
of
rose
leaves
upon
the
shrine
and
upon
the
path
before
it
the
contents
of
these
precious
vials
are
an
interesting
relic
indeed
for
they
represent
to
us
vividly
that
period
when
men
who
were
willing
to
go
to
the
stake
for
their
religious
opinions
thought
it
not
wrong
to
save
the
souls
of
their
fellowmen
by
pious
mendacity
and
consecrated
fraud
to
the
scientific
eye
this
miracle
is
very
simple
the
vials
contain
no
doubt
one
of
those
mixtures
fusing
at
low
temperature
which
while
kept
in
its
place
within
the
cold
stone
walls
of
the
church
remains
solid
but
upon
being
brought
out
into
the
hot
crowded
chapel
and
fondled
by
the
warm
hands
of
the
priests
gradually
softens
and
becomes
liquid
it
was
curious
to
note
at
the
time
above
mentioned
that
even
the
high
functionaries
representing
the
king
looked
at
the
miracle
with
awe
they
evidently
found
joy
in
believing
and
one
of
them
assured
the
present
writer
that
the
only
thing
which
could
cause
it
was
the
direct
exercise
of
miraculous
power
it
may
be
reassuring
to
persons
contemplating
a
visit
to
that
beautiful
capital
in
these
days
that
while
this
miracle
still
goes
on
it
is
no
longer
the
only
thing
relied
upon
to
preserve
the
public
health
an
unbelieving
generation
especially
taught
by
the
recent
horrors
of
the
cholera
has
thought
it
wise
to
supplement
the
power
of
januarius
by
the
risanamento
begun
mainly
in
and
still
going
on
the
drainage
of
the
city
has
thus
been
greatly
improved
the
old
wells
closed
and
pure
water
introduced
from
the
mountains
moreover
at
the
last
outburst
of
cholera
a
few
years
since
a
noble
deed
was
done
which
by
its
moral
effect
exercised
a
widespread
healing
power
upon
hearing
of
this
terrific
outbreak
of
pestilence
king
humbert
though
under
the
ban
of
the
church
broke
from
all
the
entreaties
of
his
friends
and
family
went
directly
into
the
city
and
there
in
the
streets
public
places
and
hospitals
encouraged
the
living
comforted
the
sick
and
dying
and
took
means
to
prevent
a
further
spread
of
the
pestilence
to
the
credit
of
the
church
it
should
also
be
said
that
the
cardinal
archbishop
san
felice
joined
him
in
this
miracle
for
miracle
the
effect
of
this
visit
of
the
king
seems
to
have
surpassed
anything
that
januarius
could
do
for
it
gave
confidence
and
courage
which
very
soon
showed
their
effects
in
diminishing
the
number
of
deaths
it
would
certainly
appear
that
in
this
matter
the
king
was
more
directly
under
divine
inspiration
and
guidance
than
was
the
pope
for
the
fact
that
king
humbert
went
to
naples
at
the
risk
of
his
life
while
leo
xiii
remained
in
safety
at
the
vatican
impressed
the
italian
people
in
favour
of
the
new
regime
and
against
the
old
as
nothing
else
could
have
done
in
other
parts
of
italy
the
same
progress
is
seen
under
the
new
italian
government
venice
genoa
leghorn
and
especially
rome
which
under
the
sway
of
the
popes
was
scandalously
filthy
are
now
among
the
cleanest
cities
in
europe
what
the
relics
of
januarius
anthony
and
a
multitude
of
local
fetiches
throughout
italy
were
for
ages
utterly
unable
to
do
has
been
accomplished
by
the
development
of
the
simplest
sanitary
principles
spain
shows
much
the
same
characteristics
of
a
country
where
theological
considerations
have
been
for
centuries
down
to
the
interference
of
napoleon
with
that
kingdom
all
sanitary
efforts
were
looked
upon
as
absurd
if
not
impious
the
most
sober
accounts
of
travellers
in
the
spanish
peninsula
until
a
recent
period
are
sometimes
irresistibly
comic
in
their
pictures
of
peoples
insisting
on
maintaining
arrangements
more
filthy
than
any
which
would
be
permitted
in
an
american
backwoods
camp
while
taking
enormous
pains
to
stop
pestilence
by
processions
and
new
dresses
bestowed
upon
the
local
madonnas
yet
here
too
a
healthful
scepticism
has
begun
to
work
for
good
the
outbreaks
of
cholera
in
recent
years
have
done
some
little
to
bring
in
better
sanitary
measures
as
to
the
recourse
to
fetichism
in
italy
in
time
of
plague
and
the
pictures

the
intercession
of

gradual
decay
of
theological
views
regarding
sanitation
we
have
seen
how
powerful
in
various
nations
especially
obedient
to
theology
were
the
forces
working
in
opposition
to
the
evolution
of
hygiene
and
we
shall
find
this
same
opposition
less
effective
it
is
true
but
still
acting
with
great
power
in
countries
which
had
become
somewhat
emancipated
from
theological
control
in
england
during
the
medieval
period
persecutions
of
jews
were
occasionally
resorted
to
and
here
and
there
we
hear
of
persecutions
of
witches
but
as
torture
was
rarely
used
in
england
there
were
from
those
charged
with
producing
plague
few
of
those
confessions
which
in
other
countries
gave
rise
to
widespread
cruelties
down
to
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
the
filthiness
in
the
ordinary
mode
of
life
in
england
was
such
as
we
can
now
hardly
conceive
fermenting
organic
material
was
allowed
to
accumulate
and
become
a
part
of
the
earthen
floors
of
rural
dwellings
and
this
undoubtedly
developed
the
germs
of
many
diseases
in
his
noted
letter
to
the
physician
of
cardinal
wolsey
erasmus
describes
the
filth
thus
incorporated
into
the
floors
of
english
houses
and
what
is
of
far
more
importance
he
shows
an
inkling
of
the
true
cause
of
the
wasting
diseases
of
the
period
he
says
if
i
entered
into
a
chamber
which
had
been
uninhabited
for
months
i
was
immediately
seized
with
a
fever
he
ascribed
the
fearful
plague
of
the
sweating
sickness
to
this
cause
so
too
the
noted
caius
advised
sanitary
precautions
against
the
plague
and
in
mead
pringle
and
others
urged
them
but
the
prevailing
thought
was
too
strong
and
little
was
done
even
the
floor
of
the
presence
chamber
of
queen
elizabeth
in
greenwich
palace
was
covered
with
hay
after
the
english
fashion
as
one
of
the
chroniclers
tells
us
in
the
seventeenth
century
aid
in
these
great
scourges
was
mainly
sought
in
special
church
services
the
foremost
english
churchmen
during
that
century
being
greatly
given
to
study
of
the
early
fathers
of
the
church
the
theological
theory
of
disease
so
dear
to
the
fathers
still
held
sway
and
this
was
the
case
when
the
various
visitations
reached
their
climax
in
the
great
plague
of
london
in
which
swept
off
more
than
a
hundred
thousand
people
from
that
city
the
attempts
at
meeting
it
by
sanitary
measures
were
few
and
poor
the
medical
system
of
the
time
was
still
largely
tinctured
by
superstitions
resulting
from
medieval
modes
of
thought
hence
that
plague
was
generally
attributed
to
the
divine
wrath
caused
by
the
prophaning
of
the
sabbath
texts
from
numbers
the
psalms
zechariah
and
the
apocalypse
were
dwelt
upon
in
the
pulpits
to
show
that
plagues
are
sent
by
the
almighty
to
punish
sin
and
perhaps
the
most
ghastly
figure
among
all
those
fearful
scenes
described
by
de
foe
is
that
of
the
naked
fanatic
walking
up
and
down
the
streets
with
a
pan
of
fiery
coals
upon
his
head
and
after
the
manner
of
jonah
at
nineveh
proclaiming
woe
to
the
city
and
its
destruction
in
forty
days
that
sin
caused
this
plague
is
certain
but
it
was
sanitary
sin
both
before
and
after
this
culmination
of
the
disease
cases
of
plague
were
constantly
occurring
in
london
throughout
the
seventeenth
century
but
about
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
it
began
to
disappear
the
great
fire
had
done
a
good
work
by
sweeping
off
many
causes
and
centres
of
infection
and
there
had
come
wider
streets
better
pavements
and
improved
water
supply
so
that
with
the
disappearance
of
the
plague
other
diseases
especially
dysenteries
which
had
formerly
raged
in
the
city
became
much
less
frequent
but
while
these
epidemics
were
thus
checked
in
london
others
developed
by
sanitary
ignorance
raged
fearfully
both
there
and
elsewhere
and
of
these
perhaps
the
most
fearful
was
the
jail
fever
the
prisons
of
that
period
were
vile
beyond
belief
men
were
confined
in
dungeons
rarely
if
ever
disinfected
after
the
death
of
previous
occupants
and
on
corridors
connecting
directly
with
the
foulest
sewers
there
was
no
proper
disinfection
ventilation
or
drainage
hence
in
most
of
the
large
prisons
for
criminals
or
debtors
the
jail
fever
was
supreme
and
from
these
centres
it
frequently
spread
through
the
adjacent
towns
this
was
especially
the
case
during
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
in
the
black
assize
at
oxford
in
the
chief
baron
the
sheriff
and
about
three
hundred
men
died
within
forty
hours
lord
bacon
declared
the
jail
fever
the
most
pernicious
infection
next
to
the
plague
in
at
the
dorsetshire
assize
the
chief
baron
and
many
lawyers
were
killed
by
it
the
high
sheriff
of
somerset
also
took
the
disease
and
died
a
single
scotch
regiment
being
infected
from
some
prisoners
lost
no
less
than
two
hundred
in
the
disease
was
so
virulent
at
newgate
in
the
heart
of
london
that
two
judges
the
lord
mayor
sundry
aldermen
and
many
others
died
of
it
it
is
worth
noting
that
while
efforts
at
sanitary
dealing
with
this
state
of
things
were
few
the
theological
spirit
developed
a
new
and
special
form
of
prayer
for
the
sufferers
and
placed
it
in
the
irish
prayer
book
these
forms
of
prayer
seem
to
have
been
the
main
reliance
through
the
first
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
but
about
began
the
work
of
john
howard
who
visited
the
prisons
of
england
made
known
their
condition
to
the
world
and
never
rested
until
they
were
greatly
improved
then
he
applied
the
same
benevolent
activity
to
prisons
in
other
countries
in
the
far
east
and
in
southern
europe
and
finally
laid
down
his
life
a
victim
to
disease
contracted
on
one
of
his
missions
of
mercy
but
the
hygienic
reforms
he
began
were
developed
more
and
more
until

fearful

upon
modern
civilization

removed

the

was
seen
in

protestant
colonies
of

but
here
while
plagues
were
steadily
attributed
to
divine
wrath
or
satanic
malice
there
was
one
case
in
which
it
was
claimed
that
such
a
visitation
was
due
to
the
divine
mercy
the
pestilence
among
the
indians
before
the
arrival
of

in

is

at

near

the
chronicles
of
its
sway
are
ghastly
they
speak
of
great
heaps
of

dead
in

public
places
forming
pestilential
volcanoes
of
men
and
women
in
delirium
wandering
naked
through

thronged
with
great
crowds
shrieking
for

of

crowds
flinging
themselves
into

debauchery
of

bands
assassinating
the

and
plundering
the
dead
of

thousand
neglected
children
collected
in

numbering

fifty
thousand
out
of
a
population
of
less
than
ninety
thousand
in
the
midst
of
these
fearful
scenes
stood
a
body
of
men
and
women
worthy
to
be
held
in
eternal
honour
the
physicians
from
paris
and
montpellier
the
mayor
of
the
city
and
one
or
two
of
his
associates
but
above
all
the
chevalier
roze
and
bishop
belzunce
the
history
of
these
men
may
well
make
us
glory
in
human
nature
but
in
all
this
noble
group
the
figure
of
belzunce
is
the
most
striking
nobly
and
firmly
when
so
many
others
even
among
the
regular
and
secular
ecclesiastics
fled
he
stood
by
his
flock
day
and
night
he
was
at
work
in
the
hospitals
cheering
the
living
comforting
the
dying
and
doing
what
was
possible
for
the
decent
disposal
of
the
dead
in
him
were
united
the
two
great
antagonistic
currents
of
religion
and
of
theology
as
a
theologian
he
organized
processions
and
expiatory
services
which
it
must
be
confessed
rather
increased
the
disease
than
diminished
it
moreover
he
accepted
that
wild
dream
of
a
hysterical
nun
the
worship
of
the
material
physical
sacred
heart

was
one
of

consecrate
his
diocese
to

but
on
the
other
hand
the
religious
spirit
gave
in
him
one
of
its
most
beautiful
manifestations
in
that
or
any
other
century
justly
have
the
people
of
marseilles
placed
his
statue
in
the
midst
of
their
city
in
an
attitude
of
prayer
and
blessing
in
every
part
of
europe
and
america
down
to
a
recent
period
we
find
pestilences
resulting
from
carelessness
or
superstition
still
called
inscrutable
providences
as
late
as
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
when
great
epidemics
made
fearful
havoc
in
austria
the
main
means
against
them
seem
to
have
been
grovelling
before
the
image
of
sebastian
and
calling
in
special
that
is
monks
who
cast
out
devils
to
seek
the
aid
of
physicians
was
in
the
neighbourhood
of
these
monastic
centres
very
generally
considered
impious
and
the
enormous
death
rate
in
such
neighbourhoods
was
only
diminished
in
the
present
century
when
scientific
hygiene
began
to
make
its
way
the
old
view
of
pestilence
had
also
its
full
course
in
calvinistic
scotland
the
only
difference
being
that
while
in
roman
catholic
countries
relief
was
sought
by
fetiches
gifts
processions
exorcisms
burnings
of
witches
and
other
works
of
expiation
promoted
by
priests
in
scotland
after
the
reformation
it
was
sought
in
and
executions
of
witches
promoted
by
protestant
elders
accounts
of
the
filthiness
of
scotch
cities
and
villages
down
to
a
period
well
within
this
century
seem
monstrous
all
that
in
these
days
is
swept
into
the
sewers
was
in
those
allowed
to
remain
around
the
houses
or
thrown
into
the
streets
the
old
theological
theory
that
vain
is
the
help
of
man
checked
scientific
thought
and
paralyzed
sanitary
endeavour
the
result
was
natural
between
the
thirteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
thirty
notable
epidemics
swept
the
country
and
some
of
them
carried
off
multitudes
but
as
a
rule
these
never
suggested
sanitary
improvement
they
were
called
visitations
attributed
to
divine
wrath
against
human
sin
and
the
work
of
the
authorities
was
to
announce
the
particular
sin
concerned
and
to
declaim
against
it
amazing
theories
were
thus
propounded
theories
which
led
to
spasms
of
severity
and
in
some
of
these
offences
generally
punished
much
less
severely
were
visited
with
death
every
pulpit
interpreted
the
ways
of
god
to
man
in
such
seasons
so
as
rather
to
increase
than
to
diminish
the
pestilence
the
effect
of
thus
seeking
supernatural
causes
rather
than
natural
may
be
seen
in
such
facts
as
the
death
by
plague
of
one
fourth
of
the
whole
population
of
the
city
of
perth
in
a
single
year
of
the
fifteenth
century
other
towns
suffering
similarly
both
then
and
afterward
here
and
there
physicians
more
wisely
inspired
endeavoured
to
push
sanitary
measures
and
in
attempts
were
made
to
clean
the
streets
of
edinburgh
but
the
chroniclers
tell
us
that
the
magistrates
and
ministers
gave
no
heed
one
sort
of
calamity
indeed
came
in
as
a
mercy
the
great
fires
which
swept
through
the
cities
clearing
and
cleaning
them
though
the
town
council
of
edinburgh
declared
the
noted
fire
of
a
fearful
rebuke
of
god
it
was
observed
that
after
it
had
done
its
work
disease
and
death
were
greatly
diminished
for
the

the
triumph
of
sanitary
science
but
by
those
standing
in
the
higher
places
of
thought
some
glimpses
of
scientific
truth
had
already
been
obtained
and
attempts
at
compromise
between
theology
and
science
in
this
field
began
to
be
made
not
only
by
ecclesiastics
but
first
of
all
as
far
back
as
the
seventeenth
century
by
a
man
of
science
eminent
both
for
attainments
and
character
robert
boyle
inspired
by
the
discoveries
in
other
fields
which
had
swept
away
so
much
of
theological
thought
he
could
no
longer
resist
the
conviction
that
some
epidemics
are
due
in
his
own
words
to
a
tragical
concourse
of
natural
causes
but
he
argued
that
some
of
these
may
be
the
result
of
divine
interpositions
provoked
by
human
sins
as
time
went
on
great
difficulties
showed
themselves
in
the
way
of
this
compromise
difficulties
theological
not
less
than
difficulties
scientific
to
a
catholic
it
was
more
and
more
hard
to
explain
the
theological
grounds
why
so
many
orthodox
cities
firm
in
the
faith
were
punished
and
so
many
heretical
cities
spared
and
why
in
regions
devoted
to
the
church
the
poorer
people
whose
faith
in
theological
fetiches
was
unquestioning
died
in
times
of
pestilence
like
flies
while
sceptics
so
frequently
escaped
difficulties
of
the
same
sort
beset
devoted
protestants
they
too
might
well
ask
why
it
was
that
the
devout
peasantry
in
their
humble
cottages
perished
while
so
much
larger
a
proportion
of
the
more
sceptical
upper
classes
were
untouched
gradually
it
dawned
both
upon
catholic
and
protestant
countries
that
if
any
sin
be
punished
by
pestilence
it
is
the
sin
of
filthiness
more
and
more
it
began
to
be
seen
by
thinking
men
of
both
religions
that
wesley
great
dictum
stated
even
less
than
the
truth
that
not
only
was
cleanliness
akin
to
godliness
but
that
as
a
means
of
keeping
off
pestilence
it
was
far
superior
to
godliness
as
godliness
was

understood

note
the
recent
history
of
sanitation
in
all
civilized
countries
shows
triumphs
which
might
well
fill
us
with
wonder
did
there
not
rise
within
us
a
far
greater
wonder
that
they
were
so
long
delayed
amazing
is
it
to
see
how
near
the
world
has
come
again
and
again
to
discovering
the
key
to
the
cause
and
cure
of
pestilence
it
is
now
a
matter
of
the
simplest
elementary
knowledge
that
some
of
the
worst
epidemics
are
conveyed
in
water
but
this
fact
seems
to
have
been
discovered
many
times
in
human
history
in
the
peloponnesian
war
the
athenians
asserted
that
their
enemies
had
poisoned
their
cisterns
in
the
middle
ages
the
people
generally
declared
that
the
jews
had
poisoned
their
wells
and
as
late
as
the
cholera
of
the
parisian
mob
insisted
that
the
who
distributed
water
for
drinking
purposes
from
the
seine
polluted
as
it
was
by
sewage
had
poisoned
it
and
in
some
cases
murdered
them
on
this
charge
so
far
did
this
feeling
go
that
locked
covers
were
sometimes
placed
upon
the
had
not
such
men
as
roger
bacon
and
his
long
line
of
successors
been
thwarted
by
theological
authority
had
not
such
men
as
thomas
aquinas
vincent
of
beauvais
and
albert
the
great
been
drawn
or
driven
from
the
paths
of
science
into
the
dark
tortuous
paths
of
theology
leading
no
whither
the
world
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
would
have
arrived
at
the
solution
of
great
problems
and
the
enjoyment
of
great
results
which
will
only
be
reached
at
the
end
of
the
twentieth
century
and
even
in
generations
more
remote
diseases
like
typhoid
fever
influenza
and
pulmonary
consumption
scarlet
fever
diphtheria
pneumonia
and
la
grippe
which
now
carry
off
so
many
most
precious
lives
would
have
long
since
ceased
to
scourge
the
world
still
there
is
one
cause
for
satisfaction
the
law
governing
the
relation
of
theology
to
disease
is
now
well
before
the
world
and
it
is
seen
in
the
fact
that
just
in
proportion
as
the
world
progressed
from
the
sway
of
hippocrates
to
that
of
the
ages
of
faith
so
it
progressed
in
the
frequency
and
severity
of
great
pestilences
and
that
on
the
other
hand
just
in
proportion
as
the
world
has
receded
from
that
period
when
theology
was
and
plague
after
plague
has
disappeared
and
those
remaining
have
become
less
and
less
frequent
and
virulent

the
charge
of
poisoning
water
and
producing
pestilence
among
the
greeks
see

the

a

and
these
may
well
be
studied
in
great
britain
and
the
united
states
in
the
former
though
there
had
been
many
warnings
from
eminent
physicians
and
above
all
in
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
from
men
like
caius
mead
and
pringle
the
result
was
far
short
of
what
might
have
been
gained
and
it
was
only
in
the
year
that
a
systematic
sanitary
effort
was
begun
in
england
by
the
public
authorities
the
state
of
things
at
that
time
though
by
comparison
with
the
middle
ages
happy
was
by
comparison
with
what
has
since
been
gained
fearful
the
death
rate
among
all
classes
was
high
but
among
the
poor
it
was
ghastly
out
of
thousand
paupers
in
london
during
the
years
and
fourteen
thousand
were
suffering
from
fever
and
of
these
nearly
six
thousand
from
typhus
in
many
other
parts
of
the
british
islands
the
sanitary
condition
was
no
better
a
noble
body
of
men
grappled
with
the
problem
and
in
a
few
years
one
of
these
rose
above
his
fellows
the
late
edwin
chadwick
the
opposition
to
his
work
was
bitter
and
though
many
churchmen
aided
him
the
support
given
by
theologians
and
ecclesiastics
as
a
whole
was
very
far
short
of
what
it
should
have
been
too
many
of
them
were
occupied
in
that
most
costly
and
most
worthless
of
all
processes
the
saving
of
souls
by
the
inculcation
of
dogma
yet
some
of
the
higher
ecclesiastics
and
many
of
the
lesser
clergy
did
much
sometimes
risking
their
lives
and
one
of
them
sidney
godolphin
osborne
deserves
lasting
memory
for
his
struggle
to
make
known
the
sanitary
wants
of
the
peasantry
chadwick
began
to
be
widely
known
in
as
a
member
of
the
board
of
health
and
was
driven
out
for
a
time
for
overzeal
but
from
one
point
or
another
during
forty
years
he
fought
the
opposition
developed
the
new
work
and
one
of
the
best
exhibits
of
its
results
is
shown
in
his
address
before
the
sanitary
conference
at
brighton
in
from
this
and
other
perfectly
trustworthy
sources
some
idea
may
be
gained
of
the
triumph
of
the
scientific
over
the
theological
method
of
dealing
with
disease
whether
epidemic
or
sporadic
in
the
latter
half
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
annual
mortality
of
london
is
estimated
at
not
less
than
eighty
in
a
thousand
about
the
middle
of
this
century
it
stood
at
in
a
thousand
in
it
stood
at
less
than
eighteen
in
a
thousand
and
in
many
parts
the
most
recent
statistics
show
that
it
has
been
brought
down
to
fourteen
or
fifteen
in
a
thousand
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
the
death
rate
from
disease
in
the
royal
guards
at
london
was
twenty
in
a
thousand
in
it
had
been
reduced
to
six
in
a
thousand
in
the
army
generally
it
had
been
seventeen
in
a
thousand
but
it
has
been
reduced
until
it
now
stands
at
eight
in
the
old
indian
army
it
had
been
in
a
thousand
but
of
late
it
has
been
brought
down
first
to
twenty
and
finally
to
fourteen
chadwick
in
his
speech
proved
that
much
more
might
be
done
for
he
called
attention
to
the
german
army
where
the
death
rate
from
disease
has
been
reduced
to
between
five
and
six
in
a
thousand
the
public
health
act
having
been
passed
in
the
death
rate
in
england
among
men
fell
between
and
more
than
four
in
a
thousand
and
among
women
more
than
six
in
a
thousand
in
the
decade
between
and
there
died
of
diseases
attributable
to
defective
drainage
and
impure
water
over
four
thousand
persons
in
every
million
throughout
england
these
numbers
have
declined
until
in
there
died
less
than
two
thousand
in
every
million
the
most
striking
diminution
of
the
deaths
from
such
causes
was
found
in
in
the
case
of
typhoid
fever
that
diminution
being
fifty
per
cent
as
to
the
scourge
which
next
to
plagues
like
the
black
death
was
formerly
the
most
dreaded
smallpox
there
died
of
it
in
london
during
the
year
just
one
person
drainage
in
bristol
reduced
the
death
rate
by
consumption
from
to
at
cardiff
from
to
and
in
all
england
and
wales
from
in
to
in
what
can
be
accomplished
by
better
sanitation
is
also
seen
by
a
comparison
between
the
death
rate
among
the
children
outside
and
inside
the
charity
schools
the
death
rate
among
those
outside
in
was
twelve
in
a
thousand
while
inside
where
the
children
were
under
sanitary
regulations
maintained
by
competent
authorities
it
has
been
brought
down
first
to
eight
then
to
four
and
finally
to
less
than
three
in
a
thousand
in
view
of
statistics
like
these
it
becomes
clear
that
edwin
chadwick
and
his
compeers
among
the
sanitary
authorities
have
in
half
a
century
done
far
more
to
reduce
the
rate
of
disease
and
death
than
has
been
done
in
fifteen
hundred
years
by
all
the
fetiches
which
theological
reasoning
could
devise
or
ecclesiastical
power
enforce
not
less
striking
has
been
the
history
of
hygiene
in
france
thanks
to
the
decline
of
theological
control
over
the
universities
to
the
abolition
of
monasteries
and
to
such
labours
in
hygienic
research
and
improvement
as
those
of
tardieu
levy
and
bouchardat
a
wondrous
change
has
been
wrought
in
public
health
statistics
carefully
kept
show
that
the
mean
length
of
human
life
has
been
remarkably
increased
in

iv
the
relation
of
sanitary
science
to
religion
the
question
may
now
arise
whether
this
progress
in
sanitary
science
has
been
purchased
at
any
real
sacrifice
of
religion
in
its
highest
sense
one
piece
of
recent
history
indicates
an
answer
to
this
question
the
second
empire
in
france
had
its
head
in
napoleon
iii
a
noted
voltairean
at
the
climax
of
his
power
he
determined
to
erect
an
academy
of
music
which
should
be
the
noblest
building
of
its
kind
it
was
projected
on
a
scale
never
before
known
at
least
in
modern
times
and
carried
on
for
years
millions
being
lavished
upon
it
at
the
same
time
the
emperor
determined
to
rebuild
the
the
great
paris
hospital
this
too
was
projected
on
a
greater
scale
than
anything
of
the
kind
ever
before
known
and
also
required
millions
but
in
the
erection
of
these
two
buildings
the
emperor
determination
was
distinctly
made
known
that
with
the
highest
provision
for
aesthetic
enjoyment
there
should
be
a
similar
provision
moving
on
parallel
lines
for
the
relief
of
human
suffering
this
plan
was
carried
out
to
the
letter
the
palace
of
the
opera
and
the
went
on
with
equal
steps
and
the
former
was
not
allowed
to
be
finished
before
the
latter
among
all
the
most
christian
kings
of
the
house
of
bourbon
who
had
preceded
him
for
five
hundred
years
history
shows
no
such
obedience
to
the
religious
and
moral
sense
of
the
nation
catharine
de
medici
and
her
sons
plunging
the
nation
into
the
great
wars
of
religion
never
showed
any
such
feeling
louis

revoking
the
edict
of
nantes
for
the
glory
of
god
and

the
nation
to
sorrow

of
making
the

of
his
palaces

buildings

subservient

things
never
betrayed
the

consciousness
that
while
making
enormous
expenditures
to
gratify
his
own
and
the
national
vanity
he
ought
to
carry
on

pari
passu
for
charity
nor
did
the
french
nation
at
those
periods
when
it
was
most
largely
under
the
control
of
theological
considerations
seem
to
have
any
inkling
of
the
idea
that
nation
or
monarch
should
make
provision
for
relief
from
human
suffering
to
justify
provision
for
the
sumptuous
enjoyment
of
art
it
was
reserved
for
the
second
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
to
develop
this
feeling
so
strongly
though
quietly
that
napoleon
iii
notoriously
an
unbeliever
in
all
orthodoxy
was
obliged
to
recognise
it
and
to
set
this
great
example
nor
has
the
recent
history
of
the

been
less
fruitful
in
lessons
yellow
fever
which
formerly
swept
not
only
southern
cities
but
even
new
york
and
philadelphia
has
now
been
almost
entirely
warded
off
such
epidemics
as
that
in
memphis
a
few
years
since
and
the
immunity
of
the
city
from
such
visitations
since
its
sanitary
condition
was
changed
by
waring
are
a
most
striking
object
lesson
to
the
whole
country
cholera
which
again
and
again
swept
the
country
has
ceased
to
be
feared
by
the
public
at
large
typhus
fever
once
so
deadly
is
now
rarely
heard
of
curious
is
it
to
find
that
some
of
the
diseases
which
in
the
olden
time
swept
off
myriads
on
myriads
in
every
country
now
cause
fewer
deaths
than
some
diseases
thought
of
little
account
and
for
the
cure
of
which
people
therefore
rely
to
their
cost
on
quackery
instead
of
medical
science
this
development
of
sanitary
science
and
hygiene
in
the
united
states
has
also
been
coincident
with
a
marked
change
in
the
attitude
of
the
american
pulpit
as
regards
the
theory
of
disease
in
this
country
as
in
others
down
to
a
period
within
living
memory
deaths
due
to
want
of
sanitary
precautions
were
constantly
dwelt
upon
in
funeral
sermons
as
results
of
national
sin
or
as
inscrutable
providences
that
view
has
mainly
passed
away
among
the
clergy
of
the
more
enlightened
parts
of
the
country
and
we
now
find
them
as
a
rule
active
in
spreading
useful
ideas
as
to
the
prevention
of
disease
the
religious
press
has
been
especially
faithful
in
this
respect
carrying
to
every
household
more
just
ideas
of
sanitary
precautions
and
hygienic
living
the
attitude
even
of
many
among
the
most
orthodox
rulers
in
church
and
state
has
been
changed
by
facts
like
these
lord
palmerston
refusing
the
request
of
the
scotch
clergy
that
a
fast
day
be
appointed
to
ward
off
cholera
and
advising
them
to
go
home
and
clean
their
streets
the
devout
emperor
william
ii
forbidding
in
a
similar
emergency
on
the
ground
that
they
led
to
neglect
of
practical
human
means
of
help
all
this
is
in
striking
contrast
to
the
older
methods
well
worthy
of
note
is
the
ground
taken
in
at
philadelphia
by
an
eminent
divine
of
the
protestant
episcopal
church
the
bishop
of
pennsylvania
having
issued
a
special
call
to
prayer
in
order
to
ward
off
the
cholera
this
clergyman
refused
to
respond
to
the
call
declaring
that
to
do
so
in
the
filthy
condition
of
the
streets
then
prevailing
in
philadelphia
would
be
blasphemous
in
summing
up
the
whole
subject
we
see
that
in
this
field
as
in
so
many
others

triumph
of

but
this
is
the
result
of
a
struggle
long
and
severe
between
two
great
forces
on
one
side
have
stood
the
survivals
of
various
superstitions
the
metaphysics
of
various
philosophies
the
dogmatism
of
various
theologies
the
literal
interpretation
of
various
sacred
books
and
especially
of
our
own
all
compacted
into
a
creed
that
insanity
is
mainly
or
largely
demoniacal
possession
on
the
other
side
has
stood
science
gradually
accumulating
proofs
that
insanity
is
always
the
result
of
physical
disease
i
purpose
in
this
chapter
to
sketch
as
briefly
as
i
may
the
history
of
this
warfare
or
rather
of
this
evolution
of
truth
out
of
error
nothing
is
more
simple
and
natural
in
the
early
stages
of
civilization
than
belief
in
occult
powers
of
evil
troubles
and
calamities
come
upon
man
his
ignorance
of
physical
laws
forbids
him
to
attribute
them
to
physical
causes
he
therefore
attributes
them
sometimes
to
the
wrath
of
a
good
being
but
more
frequently
to
the
malice
of
an
evil
being
especially
is
this
the
case
with
diseases
the
real
causes
of
disease
are
so
intricate
that
they
are
reached
only
after
ages
of
scientific
labour
hence
they
above
all
have
been
attributed
to
the
influence
of
evil
spirits
on
the
general
attribution
of
disease
to
demoniacal
influence

were

agency
how
much
more
diseases
of
the
brain
and
especially
the
more
obscure
of
these
these
indeed
seemed
to
the
vast
majority
of
mankind
possible
only
on
the
theory
of
satanic
intervention
any
approach
to
a
true
theory
of
the
connection
between
physical
causes
and
mental
results
is
one
of
the
highest
acquisitions
of
science
here
and
there
during
the
whole
historic
period
keen
men
had
obtained
an
inkling
of
the
truth
but
to
the
vast
multitude
down
to
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
nothing
was
more
clear
than
that
insanity
is
in
many
if
not
in
most
cases
demoniacal
possession
yet
at
a
very
early
date
in
greece
and
rome
science
had
asserted
itself
and
a
beginning
had
been
made
which
seemed
destined
to
bring
a
large
fruitage
of
blessings
in
the
fifth
century
before
the
christian
era
hippocrates
of
cos
asserted
the
great
truth
that
all
madness
is
simply
disease
of
the
brain
thereby
beginning
a
development
of
truth
and
mercy
which
lasted
nearly
a
thousand
years
in
the
first
century
after
christ
aretaeus
carried
these
ideas
yet
further
observed
the
phenomena
of
insanity
with
great
acuteness
and
reached
yet
more
valuable
results
near
the
beginning
of
the
following
century
soranus
went
still
further
in
the
same
path
giving
new
results
of
research
and
strengthening
scientific
truth
toward
the
end
of
the
same
century
a
new
epoch
was
ushered
in
by
galen
under
whom
the
same
truth
was
developed
yet
further
and
the
path
toward
merciful
treatment
of
the
insane
made
yet
more
clear
in
the
third
century
celius
aurelianus
received
this
deposit
of
precious
truth
elaborated
it
and
brought
forth
the
great
idea
which
had
theology
citing
biblical
texts
not
banished
it
would
have
saved
fifteen
centuries
of
cruelty
an
idea
not
fully
recognised
again
till
near
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
the
idea
that
insanity
is
brain
disease
and
that
the
treatment
of
it
must
be
gentle
and
kind
in
the
sixth
century
alexander
of
tralles
presented
still
more
fruitful
researches
and
taught
the
world
how
to
deal
with
melancholia
and
finally
in
the
seventh
century
this
great
line
of
scientific
men
working
mainly
under
pagan
auspices
was
closed
by
paul
of
aegina
who
under
the
protection
of
caliph
omar
made
still
further
observations
but
above
all
laid
stress
on
the
cure
of
madness
as
a
disease
and
on
the
absolute
necessity
of
mild
treatment
it
is
significant
of
this
scientific
attitude
that
the
greek
word
for
superstition
means
literally
fear
of
gods
or
demons
such
was
this
great
succession
in
the
apostolate
of
science
evidently
no
other
has
ever
shown
itself
more
directly
under
divine
grace
illumination
and
guidance
it
had
given
to
the
world
what
might
have
been
one
of
its
greatest
blessings
for
authorities
regarding
this
development
of
scientific
truth
and
mercy
in
antiquity

this
evolution
of
divine
truth
was
interrupted
by
theology
there
set
into
the
early
church
a
current
of
belief
which
was
destined
to
bring
all
these
noble
acquisitions
of
science
and
religion
to
naught
and
during
centuries
to
inflict
tortures
physical
and
mental
upon
hundreds
of
thousands
of
innocent
men
and
women
a
belief
which
held
its
cruel
sway
for
nearly
eighteen
centuries
and
this
belief
was
that
madness
was
mainly
or
largely
possession
by
the
devil
this
idea
of
diabolic
agency
in
mental
disease
had
grown
luxuriantly
in
all
the
oriental
sacred
literatures
in
the
series
of
assyrian
mythological
tablets
in
which
we
find
those
legends
of
the
creation
the
fall
the
flood
and
other
early
conceptions
from
which
the
hebrews
so
largely
drew
the
accounts
wrought
into
the
book
of
genesis
have
been
discovered
the
formulas
for
driving
out
the
evil
spirits
which
cause
disease
in
the
persian
theology
regarding
the
struggle
of
the
great
powers
of
good
and
evil
this
idea
was
developed
to
its
highest
point
from
these
and
other
ancient
sources
the
jews
naturally
received
this
addition
to
their
earlier
view
the
mocker
of
the
garden
of
eden
became
satan
with
legions
of
evil
angels
at
his
command
and
the
theory
of
diabolic
causes
of
mental
disease
took
a
firm
place
in
our
sacred
books
such
cases
in
the
old
testament
as
the
evil
spirit
in
saul
which
we
now
see
to
have
been
simply
melancholy
and
in
the
new
testament
the
various
accounts
of
the
casting
out
of
devils
through
which
is
refracted
the
beautiful
and
simple
story
of
that
power
by
which
jesus
of
nazareth
soothed
perturbed
minds
by
his
presence
or
quelled
outbursts
of
madness
by
his
words
give
examples
of
this
in
greece
too
an
idea
akin
to
this
found
lodgment
both
in
the
popular
belief
and
in
the
philosophy
of
plato
and
socrates
and
though
as
we
have
seen
the
great
leaders
in
medical
science
had
taught
with
more
or
less
distinctness
that
insanity
is
the
result
of
physical
disease
there
was
a
strong
popular
tendency
to
attribute
the
more
troublesome
cases
of
it
to
hostile
spiritual
influence
for
the
exorcism
against
disease
found
at
ninevah
see

a
very
interesting
passage

the
representaion

very
frank
statement
regarding
the
transmission
of
ideas
regarding
satanic
power

our
sacred
books
see
sayce
herodotus
appendix
ii
it
is
indeed
extremely
doubtful
whether
plato
himself
or
his
contemporaries
knew
anything
of
evil
demons
this
conception
probably
coming
into
the
greek
world
as
into
the
latin
with
the
oriental
influences
that
began
to
prevail
about
the
time
of
the
birth
of
christ
but
to
the
early
christians
a
demon
was
a
demon
and
plato
good
or
bad
were
pagan
and
therefore
devils
the
greek
word
epilepsy
is
itself
a
survival
of
the
old
belief
fossilized
in
a
word
since
its
literal
meaning
refers
to
the
seizure
of
the
patient
by
evil
spirits
from
all
these
sources
but
especially
from
our
sacred
books
and
the
writings
of
plato
this
theory
that
mental
disease
is
caused
largely
or
mainly
by
satanic
influence
passed
on
into
the
early
church
in
the
apostolic
times
no
belief
seems
to
have
been
more
firmly
settled
the
early
fathers
and
doctors
in
the
following
age
universally
accepted
it
and
the
apologists
generally
spoke
of
the
power
of
casting
out
devils
as
a
leading
proof
of
the
divine
origin
of
the
christian
religion
this
belief
took
firm
hold
upon
the
strongest
men
the
case
of
gregory
the
great
is
typical
he
was
a
pope
of
exceedingly
broad
mind
for
his
time
and
no
one
will
think
him
unjustly
reckoned
one
of
the
four
doctors
of
the
western
church
yet
he
solemnly
relates
that
a
nun
having
eaten
some
lettuce
without
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
swallowed
a
devil
and
that
when
commanded
by
a
holy
man
to
come
forth
the
devil
replied
how
am

blame

sitting

see
the

and
following
as
a
result
of
this
idea
the
christian
church
at
an
early
period
in
its
existence
virtually
gave
up
the
noble
conquests
of
greek
and
roman
science
in
this
field
and
originated
for
persons
supposed
to
be
possessed
a
regular
discipline
developed
out
of
dogmatic
theology
but
during
the
centuries
before
theology
and
ecclesiasticism
had
become
fully
dominant
this
discipline
was
as
a
rule
gentle
and
useful
the
afflicted
when
not
too
violent
were
generally
admitted
to
the
exercises
of
public
worship
and
a
kindly
system
of
cure
was
attempted
in
which
prominence
was
given
to
holy
water
sanctified
ointments
the
breath
or
spittle
of
the
priest
the
touching
of
relics
visits
to
holy
places
and
submission
to
mild
forms
of
exorcism
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
many
of
these
things
when
judiciously
used
in
that
spirit
of
love
and
gentleness
and
devotion
inherited
by
the
earlier
disciples
from
the
master
produced
good
effects
in
soothing
disturbed
minds
and
in
aiding
their
cure
among
the
thousands
of
fetiches
of
various
sorts
then
resorted
to
may
be
named
as
typical
the
holy
handkerchief
of
besancon
during
many
centuries
multitudes
came
from
far
and
near
to
touch
it
for
it
was
argued
if
touching
the
garments
of
paul
at
ephesus
had
cured
the
diseased
how
much
more
might
be
expected
of
a
handkerchief
of
the
lord
himself
with
ideas
of
this
sort
was
mingled
a
vague
belief
in
medical
treatment
and
out
of
this
mixture
were
evolved
such
prescriptions
as
the
following
if
an
elf
or
a
goblin
come
smear
his
forehead
with
this
salve
put
it
on
his
eyes
cense
him

had
this
been
the
worst
treatment
of
lunatics
developed
in
the
theological
atmosphere
of
the
middle
ages
the
world
would
have
been
spared
some
of
the
most
terrible
chapters
in
its
history
but
unfortunately
the
idea
of
the
satanic
possession
of
lunatics
led
to
attempts
to
punish
the
indwelling
demon
as
this
theological
theory
and
practice
became
more
fully
developed
and
ecclesiasticism
more
powerful
to
enforce
it
all
mildness
began
to
disappear
the
admonitions
to
gentle
treatment
by
the
great
pagan
and
moslem
physicians
were
forgotten
and
the
treatment
of
lunatics
tended
more
and
more
toward
severity
more
and
more
generally
it
was
felt
that
cruelty
to
madmen
was
punishment
of
the
devil
residing
within
or
acting
upon
them
a
few
strong
churchmen
and
laymen
made
efforts
to
resist
this
tendency
as
far
back
as
the
fourth
century
nemesius
bishop
of
emesa
accepted
the
truth
as
developed
by
pagan
physicians
and
aided
them
in
strengthening
it
in
the
seventh
century
a
lombard
code
embodied
a
similar
effort
in
the
eighth
century
one
of
charlemagne
capitularies
seems
to
have
had
a
like
purpose
in
the
ninth
century

great
churchman

statesman
agobard

superior
to
his
time
in
this
as
in
so
many
other
things
tried
to
make

reason
prevail
in
this
field
and
near
the
beginning
of
the
tenth
century
regino
abbot
of
prum
in
the
diocese
of
treves
insisted
on
treating
possession
as
disease
but
all
in
vain
the
current
streaming
most
directly
from
sundry
texts
in
the
christian
sacred
books

two
of
his
conclusions
the
results

profound
thought
enforced

popularized
by

soon
took
special
hold
upon
the
thinking
portion
of
the
people
at
large
the
first
of
these
which
he
easily
based
upon
scripture
and
st
basil
was
that
since
all
demons
suffer
by
material
fire
and
brimstone
they
must
have
material
bodies
the
second
was

by

of

in
the
warm
atmosphere
of

the
idea
of
demoniacal
possession
as
the
main
source
of
lunacy
grew
and
blossomed
and
bore
fruit
in
noxious
luxuriance
there
had
indeed
come
into
the
middle
ages
an
inheritance
of
scientific
thought
the
ideas
of
hippocrates
celius
aurelianus
galen
and
their
followers
were
from
time
to
time
revived
the
arabian
physicians
the
school
of
salerno
such
writers
as
salicetus
and
guy
de
chauliac
and
even
some
of
the
religious
orders
did
something
to
keep
scientific
doctrines
alive
but
the
tide
of
theological
thought
was
too
strong
it
became
dangerous
even
to
seem
to
name
possible
limits
to
diabolical
power
to
deny
satan
was
atheism
and
perhaps
nothing
did
so
much
to
fasten
the
epithet
atheist
upon
the
medical
profession
as
the
suspicion
that
it
did
not
fully
acknowledge
diabolical
interference
in
mental
disease
following
in
the
lines
of
the
earlier
fathers
anselm
abelard
thomas
aquinas
vincent
of
beauvais
all
the
great
doctors
in
the
medieval
church
some
of
them
in
spite
of
occasional
misgivings
upheld
the
idea
that
insanity
is
largely
or
mainly
demoniacal
possession
basing
their
belief
steadily
on
the
sacred
scriptures
and
this
belief
was
followed
up
in
every
quarter
by
more
and
more
constant
citation
of
the
text
thou
shalt
not
suffer
a
witch
to
live
no
other
text
of
scripture
save
perhaps
one
has
caused
the
shedding
of
so
much
innocent
blood
as
we
look
over
the
history
of
the
middle
ages
we
do
indeed
see
another
growth
from
which
one
might
hope
much
for
there
were
two
great
streams
of
influence
in
the
church
and
never
were
two
powers
more
unlike
each
other
on
one
side
was
the
spirit
of
christianity
as
it
proceeded
from
the
heart
and
mind
of
its
blessed
founder
immensely
powerful
in
aiding
the
evolution
of
religious
thought
and
effort
and
especially
of
provision
for
the
relief
of
suffering
by
religious
asylums
and
tender
care
nothing
better
expresses
this
than
the
touching
words
inscribed
upon
a
great
medieval
hospital
christo
in
pauperibus
suis
but
on
the
other
side
was
the
theological
theory
proceeding
as
we
have
seen
from
the
survival
of
ancient
superstitions
and
sustained
by
constant
reference
to
the
texts
in
our
sacred
books
that
many
and
probably
most
of
the
insane
were
possessed
by
the
devil
or
in
league
with
him
and
that
the
cruel
treatment
of
lunatics
was
simply
punishment
of
the
devil
and
his
minions
by
this
current
of
thought
was
gradually
developed
one
of
the
greatest
masses
of
superstitious
cruelty
that
has
ever
afflicted
humanity
at
the
same
time
the
stream
of
christian
endeavour
so
far
as
the
insane
were
concerned
was
almost
entirely
cut
off
in
all
the
beautiful
provision
during
the
middle
ages
for
the
alleviation
of
human
suffering
there
was
for
the
insane
almost
no
care
some
monasteries
indeed
gave
them
refuge
we
hear
of
a
charitable
work
done
for
them
at
the
london
bethlehem
hospital
in
the
thirteenth
century
at
geneva
in
the
fifteenth
at
marseilles
in
the
sixteenth
by
the
black
penitents
in
the
south
of
france
by
certain
franciscans
in
northern
france
by
the
alexian
brothers
on
the
rhine
and
by
various
agencies
in
other
parts
of
europe
but
curiously
enough
the
only
really
important
effort
in
the
christian
church
was
stimulated
by
the
mohammedans
certain
monks
who
had
much
to
do
with
them
in
redeeming
christian
slaves
found
in
the
fifteenth
century
what
john
howard
found
in
the
eighteenth
that
the
arabs
and
turks
made
a
large
and
merciful
provision
for
lunatics
such
as
was
not
seen
in
christian
lands
and
this
example
led
to
better
establishments
in
spain
and
italy
all
honour
to
this
work
and
to
the
men
who
engaged
in
it
but
as
a
rule
these
establishments
were
few
and
poor
compared
with
those
for
other
diseases
and
they
usually
degenerated
into
where
devils
were
cast
out
mainly
by
cruelty
for
a
very
full
and
learned
if
somewhat
account
of
the
earlier
effects
of
this
stream
of
charitable
thought
see

it
is
instructive
to
note
that
while
this
book
is
very
full
in
regard
to
the
action
of
the
church
on
slavery
and
on
provision
for
the
widows
and
orphans
the
sick
infirm
captives
and
lepers
there
is
hardly
a
trace
of
any
care
for
the
insane
this
same
want
is
incidentally
shown
by

the
first
main
weapon
against
the
indwelling
satan
continued
to
be
the
exorcism
but
under
the
influence
of
inferences
from
scripture
farther
and
farther
fetched
and
of
theological
reasoning
more
and
more
subtle
it
became
something
very
different
from
the
gentle
procedure
of
earlier
times
and
some
description
of
this
great
weapon
at
the
time
of
its
highest
development
will
throw
light
on
the
laws
which
govern
the
growth
of
theological
reasoning
as
well
as
upon
the
main
subject
in
hand
a
fundamental
premise
in
the
fully
developed
exorcism
was
that
according
to
sacred
scripture
a
main
characteristic
of
satan
is
pride
pride
led
him
to
rebel
for
pride
he
was
cast
down
therefore
the
first
thing
to
do
in
driving
him
out
of
a
lunatic
was
to
strike
a
fatal
blow
at
his
pride
to
disgust
him
this
theory
was
carried
out
logically
to
the
letter
the
treatises
on
the
subject
simply
astound
one
by
their
wealth
of
blasphemous
and
obscene
epithets
which
it
was
allowable
for
the
exorcist
to
use
in
casting
out
devils
the
treasury
of
exorcisms
contains
hundreds
of
pages
packed
with
the
vilest
epithets
which
the
worst
imagination
could
invent
for
the
purpose

this
procedure
and
its
results
were
recognised
as
among
the
glories
of
the
church
as
typical
we
may
mention
an
exorcism
directed
by
a
certain
bishop
of
beauvais
which
was
so
effective
that
five
devils
gave
up
possession
of
a
sufferer
and
signed
their
names
each
for
himself
and
his
subordinate
imps
to
an
agreement
that
the
possessed
should
be
molested
no
more
so
too
the
jesuit
fathers
at
vienna
in
gloried
in
the
fact
that
in
such
a
contest
they
had
cast
out
twelve
thousand
six
hundred
and
living
devils
the
ecclesiastical
annals
of
the
middle
ages
and
indeed
of
a
later
period
abound
in
boasts
of
such
mighty
works
in
my
previous
chapters
especially
that
on
meteorology
i
have
quoted
extensively
from
the
original
treatises
of
which
a
very
large
collection
is
in
my
posession
but
in
this
chapter
i
have
mainly
availed
myself
of
the
copious
translations
given
by

excellent

such
was
the
result
of
a
thousand
years
of
theological
reasoning
by
the
strongest
minds
in
europe
upon
data
partly
given
in
scripture
and
partly
inherited
from
paganism
regarding
satan
and
his
work
among
men
under
the
guidance
of
theology
always
so
severe
against
science
falsely
so
called
the
world
had
come
a
long
way
indeed
from
the
soothing
treatment
of
the
possessed
by
him
who
bore
among
the
noblest
of
his
titles
that
of
the
great
physician
the
result
was
natural
the
treatment
of
the
insane
fell
more
and
more
into
the
hands
of
the
jailer
the
torturer
and
the
executioner
to
go
back
for
a
moment
to
the
beginnings
of
this
unfortunate
development
in
spite
of
the
earlier
and
more
kindly
tendency
in
the
church
the
synod
of
ancyra
as
early
as
commanded
the
expulsion
of
possessed
persons
from
the
church
the
visigothic
christians
whipped
them
and
charlemagne
in
spite
of
some
good
enactments
imprisoned
them
men
and
women
whose
distempered
minds
might
have
been
restored
to
health
by
gentleness
and
skill
were
driven
into
hopeless
madness
by
noxious
medicines
and
brutality
some
few
were
saved
as
mere
lunatics
they
were
surrendered
to
general
carelessness
and
became
simply
a
prey
to
ridicule
and
aimless
brutality
but
vast
numbers
were
punished
as
tabernacles
of
satan
one
of
the
least
terrible
of
these
punishments
and
perhaps
the
most
common
of
all
was
that
of
scourging
demons
out
of
the
body
of
a
lunatic
this
method
commended
itself
even
to
the
judgment
of
so
thoughtful
and
kindly
a
personage
as
sir
thomas
more
and
as
late
as
the
sixteenth
century
but
if
the
disease
continued
as
it
naturally
would
after
such
treatment
the
authorities
frequently
felt
justified
in
driving
out
the
demons

torture

what
wonder
then
that
men

women
had
vivid
dreams
of
satanic
influence
that
dread
of
it
was
like
dread
of
the
plague
and
that
this
terror
spread
the
disease
enormously
until
we
hear
of
convents
villages
and
even
large
districts
ravaged
by
epidemics
of
diabolical
possession
i
shall
discuss
these
epidemics
of
possession
which
form
a
somewhat
distinct
class
of
phenomena
in
the
next
chapter
and
this
terror
naturally
bred
not
only
active
cruelty
toward
those
supposed
to
be
possessed
but
indifference
to
the
sufferings
of
those
acknowledged
to
be
lunatics
as
we
have
already
seen
while
ample
and
beautiful
provision
was
made
for
every
other
form
of
human
suffering
for
this
there
was
comparatively
little
and
indeed
even
this
little
was
generally
worse
than
none
of
this
indifference
and
cruelty
we
have
a
striking
monument
in
a
single
english
word
a
word
originally
significant
of
gentleness
and
mercy
but
which
became
significant
of
wild
riot
brutality
and
confusion
bethlehem

modern
art
has
also
dwelt
upon
this
theme
and
perhaps
the
most
touching
of
all
its
exhibitions
is
the
picture
by
a
great
french
master
representing
a
tender
woman
bound
to
a
column
and
exposed
to
the
jeers
insults
and
missiles

typical
picture

struggle

is

gallery

modern
picture
is
robert
fleury
painting
in
the
luxembourg
gallery
at
paris
here
and
there
even
in
the
worst
of
times
men
arose
who
attempted
to
promote
a
more
humane
view
but
with
little
effect
one
expositor
of
matthew
having
ventured
to
recall
the
fact
that
some
of
the
insane
were
spoken
of
in
the
new
testament
as
lunatics
and
to
suggest
that
their
madness
might
be
caused
by
the
moon
was
answered
that
their
madness
was
not
caused
by
the
moon
but
by
the
devil
who
avails
himself
of
the
moonlight
for
his
work

one
result
of
this
idea
was
a
mode
of
cure
which
especially
aggravated
and
spread
mental
disease
the
promotion
of
great
religious
processions
troops
of
men
and
women
crying
howling
imploring
saints
and
beating
themselves
with
whips
visited
various
sacred
shrines
images
and
places
in
the
hope
of
driving
off
the
powers
of
evil
the
only
result
was
an
increase
in
the
numbers
of
the
diseased
for
hundreds
of
years
this
idea
of
diabolic
possession
was
steadily
developed
it
was
believed
that
devils
entered
into
animals
and
animals
were
accordingly
exorcised
tried
tortured
convicted
and
executed
the
great
ambrose
tells
us
that
a
priest
while
saying
mass
was
troubled
by
the
croaking
of
frogs
in
a
neighbouring
marsh
that
he
exorcised
them
and
so
stopped
their
noise
bernard
as
the
monkish
chroniclers
tell
us
mounting
the
pulpit
to
preach
in
his
abbey
was
interrupted
by
a
cloud
of
flies
straightway
the
saint
uttered
the
sacred
formula
of
excommunication
when
the
flies
fell
dead
upon
the
pavement
in
heaps
and
were
cast
out
with
shovels
a
formula
of
exorcism
attributed
to
a
saint
of
the
ninth
century
which
remained
in
use
down
to
a
recent
period
especially
declares
insects
injurious
to
crops
to
be
possessed
of
evil
spirits
and
names
among
the
animals
to
be
excommunicated
or
exorcised
mice
moles
and
serpents
the
use
of
exorcism
against
caterpillars
and
grasshoppers
was
also
common
in
the
thirteenth
century
a
bishop
of
lausanne
finding
that
the
eels
in
lake
leman
troubled
the
fishermen
attempted
to
remove
the
difficulty
by
exorcism
and
two
centuries
later
one
of
his
successors
excommunicated
all
the
in
the
diocese
as
late
as
there
appears
an
entry
on
the
municipal
register
of
thonon
as
follows
resolved
that
this
town
join
with
other
parishes
of
this
province
in
obtaining
from
rome
an
excommunication
against
the
insects
and
that
it
will
contribute
pro
rata
to
the
expenses
of
the
same
did
any
one
venture
to
deny
that
animals
could
be
possessed
by
satan
he
was
at
once
silenced
by
reference
to
the
entrance
of
satan
into
the
serpent
in
the
garden
of
eden
and
to
the
casting
of
devils
into
swine
by
the
founder
of
christianity
himself

and
for
a
formula
and
ceremonies
used
in
excommunicating
insects
see
rydberg
pp
and
following
one
part
of
this
superstition
most
tenaciously
held
was
the
belief
that
a
human
being
could
be
transformed
into
one
of
the
lower
animals
this
became
a
fundamental
point
the
most
dreaded
of
predatory
animals
in
the
middle
ages
were
the
wolves
driven
from
the
hills
and
forests
in
the
winter
by
hunger
they
not
only
devoured
the
flocks
but
sometimes
came
into
the
villages
and
seized
children
from
time
to
time
men
and
women
whose
brains
were
disordered
dreamed
that
they
had
been
changed
into
various
animals
and
especially
into
wolves
on
their
confessing
this
and
often
implicating
others
many
executions
of
lunatics
resulted
moreover
countless
sane
victims
suspected
of
the
same
impossible
crime
were
forced
by
torture
to
confess
it
and
sent
unpitied
to
the
stake
the
belief
in
such
a
transformation
pervaded
all
europe
and
lasted
long
even
in
protestant
countries
probably
no
article
in
the
witch
creed
had
more
adherents
in
the
fifteenth
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
than
this
nearly
every
parish
in
europe
had
its
resultant
horrors
the
reformed
church
in
all
its
branches
fully
accepted
the
doctrines
of
witchcraft
and
diabolic
possession
and
developed
them
still
further
no
one
urged
their
fundamental
ideas
more
fully
than
luther
he
did
indeed
reject
portions
of
the
witchcraft
folly
but
to
the
influence
of
devils
he
not
only
attributed
his
maladies
but
his
dreams
and
nearly
everything
that
thwarted
or
disturbed
him
the
flies
which
lighted
upon
his
book
the
rats
which
kept
him
awake
at
night
he
believed
to
be
devils
the
resistance
of
the
archbishop
of
mayence
to
his
ideas
he
attributed
to
satan
literally
working
in
that
prelate
heart
to
his
disciples
he
told
stories
of
men
who
had
been
killed
by
rashly
resisting
the
devil
insanity
he
was
quite
sure
was
caused
by
satan
and
he
exorcised
sufferers
against
some
he
appears
to
have
advised
stronger
remedies
and
his
horror
of
idiocy
as
resulting
from
satanic
influence
was
so
great
that
on
one
occasion
he
appears
to
have
advised
the
killing
of
an
idiot
child
as
being
the
direct
offspring
of
satan
yet
luther
was
one
of
the
most
tender
and
loving
of
men
in
the
whole
range
of
literature
there
is
hardly
anything
more
touching
than
his
words
and
tributes
to
children
in
enforcing
his
ideas
regarding
insanity
he
laid
stress
especially
upon
the
question
of
paul
as
to
the
bewitching
of
the
galatians
and
regarding
idiocy
on
the
account
in
genesis
of
the
birth
of
children
whose
fathers
were
sons
of
god
and
whose
mothers
were
daughters
of
men
one
idea
of
his
was
especially
characteristic
the
descent
of
christ
into
hell
was
a
frequent
topic
of
discussion
in
the
reformed
church
melanchthon
with
his
love
of
greek
studies
held
that
the
purpose
of
the
saviour
in
making
such
a
descent
was
to
make
himself
known
to
the
great
and
noble
men
of
antiquity
plato
socrates
and
the
rest
but
luther
insisted
that
his
purpose
was
to
conquer
satan
in
a
struggle
this
idea
of
diabolic
influence
pervaded
his
conversation
his
preaching
his
writings
and
spread
thence
to
the
lutheran
church
in
general
calvin
also
held
to
the
same
theory
and
having
more
power
with
less
kindness
of
heart
than
luther
carried
it
out
with
yet
greater
harshness
beza
was
especially
severe
against
those
who
believed
insanity
to
be
a
natural
malady
and
declared
such
persons
are
refuted
both
by
sacred
and
profane
history
under
the
influence
then
of
such
infallible
teachings
in
the
older
church
and
in
the
new
this
superstition
was
developed
more
and
more
into
cruelty
and
as
the
biblical
texts
popularized
in
the
sculptures
and
windows
and
mural
decorations
of
the
great
medieval
cathedrals
had
done
much
to
develop
it
among
the
people
so
luther
translation
of
the
bible
especially
in
the
numerous
editions
of
it
illustrated
with
engravings
wrought
with
enormous
power
to
spread
and
deepen
it
in
every
peasant
cottage
some
one
could
spell
out
the
story
of
the
devil
bearing
christ
through
the
air
and
placing
him
upon
the
pinnacle
of
the
temple
of
the
woman
with
seven
devils
of
the
devils
cast
into
the
swine
every
peasant
child
could
be
made
to
understand
the
quaint
pictures
in
the
family
bible
or
the
catechism
which
illustrated
vividly
all
those
texts
in
the
ideas
thus
deeply
implanted
the
men
who
in
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
struggled
against
this
mass
of
folly
and
cruelty
found
the
worst
barrier
to

the
writer
of
this

in
visiting
the
town
church
of
wittenberg
noticed
just
opposite
the
pulpit
where
luther
so
often
preached
a
very
spirited
figure
of
an
imp
peering
out
upon
the
congregation
one
can
but
suspect
that
this
mediaeval
survival
frequently
suggested
luther
favourite
topic
during
his
sermons
for
beza
see
his
notes
on
the
new
testament

iv
such
was
the
treatment
of
demoniacs
developed
by
theology
and
such
the
practice
enforced
by
ecclesiasticism
for
more
than
a
thousand
years
how
an
atmosphere
was
spread
in
which
this
belief
began
to
dissolve
away
how
its
main
foundations
were
undermined
by
science
and
how
there
came
in
gradually
a
reign
of
humanity
will
now
be
related
ii
beginnings
of
a
healthful
scepticism
we
have
now
seen
the
culmination
of
the
old
procedure
regarding
insanity
as
it
was
developed
under
theology
and
enforced
by
ecclesiasticism
and
we
have
noted
how
under
the
influence
of
luther
and
calvin
the
reformation
rather
deepened
than
weakened
the
faith
in
the
malice
and
power
of
a
personal
devil
nor
was
this
in
the
reformed
churches
any
more
than
in
the
old
mere
matter
of
theory
as
in
the
early
ages
of
christianity
its
priests
especially
appealed
in
proof
of
the
divine
mission
to
their
power
over
the
enemy
of
mankind
in
the
bodies
of
men
so
now
the
clergy
of
the
rival
creeds
eagerly
sought
opportunities
to
establish
the
truth
of
their
own
and
the
falsehood
of
their
opponents
doctrines
by
the
visible
casting
out
of
devils
true
their
methods
differed
somewhat
where
the
catholic
used
holy
water
and
consecrated
wax
the
protestant
was
content
with
texts
of
scripture
and
importunate
prayer
but
the
supplementary
physical
annoyance
of
the
indwelling
demon
did
not
greatly
vary
sharp
was
the
competition
for
the
unhappy
objects
of
treatment
each
side
of
course
stoutly
denied
all
efficacy
to
its
adversaries
efforts
urging
that
any
seeming
victory
over
satan
was
due
not
to
the
defeat
but
to
the
collusion
of
the
fiend
as
according
to
the
master
himself
no
man
can
by
beelzebub
cast
out
devils
the
patient
was
now
in
greater
need
of
relief
than
before
and
more
than
one
poor
victim
had
to
bear
alternately
lutheran
roman
and
perhaps
calvinistic
exorcism
for
instances
of
this
competition

to
an

by
the
great
canisius
of
a
spirit

had
baffled

conjuration
among
the
most
jubilant

exulting
in
luther
alleged
failure
as
an
exorcist
but
far
more
serious
in
its
consequences
was
another
rivalry
to
which
in
the
sixteenth
century
the
clergy
of
all
creeds
found
themselves
subject
the
revival
of
the
science
of
medicine
under
the
impulse
of
the
new
study
of
antiquity
suddenly
bade
fair
to
take
out
of
the
hands
of
the
church
the
profession
of
which
she
had
enjoyed
so
long
and
so
profitable
a
monopoly
only
one
class
of
diseases
remained
unquestionably
hers
those
which
were
still
admitted
to
be
due
to
the
direct
personal
interference
of
satan
and
foremost
among
these
was
insanity
it
was
surely
no
wonder
that
an
age
of
religious
controversy
and
excitement
should
be
exceptionally
prolific
in
ailments
of
the
mind
and
to
men
who
mutually
taught
the
utter
futility
of
that
baptismal
exorcism
by
which
the
babes
of
their
misguided
neighbours
were
made
to
renounce
the
devil
and
his
works
it
ought
not
to
have
seemed
strange
that
his
victims
now
became
more
numerous
but
so
simple
an
explanation
did
not
satisfy
these
physicians
of
souls
they
therefore
devised
a
simpler
one
their
patients
they
alleged
were
bewitched
and
their
increase
was
due
to
the
growing
numbers
of
those
human
allies
of
satan
known
as
witches
for
the
attitude
of
the
catholic
clergy
the
best
sources
are
the
confidential
jesuit
litterae
annuae
to
this
day
the
numerous
treatises
on
pastoral
medicine
in
use
in
the
older
church
devote
themselves
mainly
to
this
sort
of
warfare
with
the
devil
baptismal
exorcism
continued
in
use
among
the
lutherans
till
the
eighteenth
century
though
the
struggle
over
its
abandonment
had
been
long
and
sharp
see
krafft
histories
vom
exorcismo
hamburg
already
before
the
close
of
the
fifteenth
century
pope
innocent
viii
had
issued
the
startling
bull
by
which
he
called
on
the
archbishops
bishops
and
other
clergy
of
germany
to
join
hands
with
his
inquisitors
in
rooting
out
these
willing
of
satan
who
were
said
to
swarm
throughout
all
that
country
and
to
revel
in
the
blackest
crimes
other
popes
had
since
reiterated
the
appeal
and
though
none
of
these
documents
touched
on
the
blame
of
witchcraft
for
diabolic
possession
the
inquisitors
charged
with
their
execution
pointed
it
out
most
clearly
in
their
fearful
handbook
the
and
prescribed
the
special
means
by
which
possession
thus
caused
should
be
met
these
teachings
took
firm
root
in
religious
minds
everywhere
and
during
the
great
age
of
that
followed
the
reformation
it
may
well
be
doubted
whether
any
single
cause
so
often
gave
rise
to
an
outbreak
of
the
persecution
as
the
alleged
bewitchment
of
some
poor
mad
or
foolish
or
hysterical
creature
the
persecution
thus
once
under
way
fed
itself
for
under
the
terrible
doctrine
of
excepted
cases
by
which
in
the
religious
crimes
of
heresy
and
witchcraft
there
was
no
limit
to
the
use
of
torture
the
witch
was
forced
to
confess
to
accomplices
who
in
turn
accused
others
and
so
on
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
the
jesuit
stengel
professor
at
ingolstadt
who
in
his
great
work
de
judiciis
divinis
urges
as
reasons
why
a
merciful
god
permits
illness
his
wish
to
glorify
himself
through
the
miracles
wrought
by
his
church
and
his
desire
to
test
the
faith
of
men
by
letting
them
choose
between
the
holy
aid
of
the
church
and
the
illicit
resort
to
medicine
declares
that
there
is
a
difference
between
simple
possession
and
that
brought
by
bewitchment
and
insists
that
the
latter
is
the
more
difficult
to
treat
the
horrors
of
such
a
persecution
with
the
consciousness
of
an
devil
it
breathed
and
the
panic
terror
of
him
it
inspired
could
not
but
aggravate
the
insanity
it
claimed
to
cure
though
rarer
than
is
often
believed
were
the
cases
where
crazed
women
voluntarily
accused
themselves
of
this
impossible
crime
one
of
the
most
eminent
authorities
on
diseases
of
the
mind
declares
that
among
the
unfortunate
beings
who
were
put
to
death
for
witchcraft
he
recognises
victims
of
cerebral
disorders
while
an
equally
eminent
authority
in
germany
tells
us
that
in
a
most
careful
study
of
the
original
records
of
their
trials
by
torture
he
has
often
found
their
answers
and
recorded
conversations
exactly
like
those
familiar
to
him
in
our
modern
lunatic
asylums
and
names
some
forms
of
insanity
which
constantly
and
un
mistakably
appear
among
those
who
suffered
for
criminal
dealings
with
the
devil
the
result
of
this
widespread
terror
was
naturally
therefore
a
steady
increase
in
mental
disorders
a
great
modern
authority
tells
us
that
although
modern
civilization
tends
to
increase
insanity
the
number
of
lunatics
at
present
is
far
less
than
in
the
ages
of
faith
and
in
the
reformation
period
the
treatment
of
the
possessed
as
we
find
it
laid
down
in
standard
treatises
sanctioned
by
orthodox
churchmen
and
jurists
accounts
for
this
abundantly
one
sort
of
treatment
used
for
those
accused
of
witchcraft

also
serve
to
show
this
the

all
things
in

most
certainly
beneficial
yet
under
this
practice
these
creatures
were
prevented
night
after
night
and
day
after
day
from
sleeping
or
even
resting
in
this
way

delusion
became
chronic
insanity
mild

became
violent

and
death
ensued
and
the
ways
of

to

were
justified
but
the
most
contemptible
creatures
in
all
those
centuries
were
the
physicians
who
took
sides
with

orthodoxy

when

form

disease
took

character

the
profundity
of
theologians
and
jurists
constantly
developed
new
theories
as
to
the
modes
of
diabolic
entrance
into
the
possessed
one
such
theory
was
that
satan
could
be
taken
into
the
mouth
with
food
perhaps
in
the
form
of
an
insect
swallowed
on
a
leaf
of
salad
and
this
was
sanctioned
as
we
have
seen
by
no
less
infallible
an
authority
than
gregory
the
great
pope
and
saint
another
theory
was
that
satan
entered
the
body
when
the
mouth
was
opened
to
breathe
and
there
are
cases
of
doctors
and
divines
who
when
casting
out
evil
spirits
took
especial
care
lest
the
imp
might
jump
into
their
own
mouths
from
the
mouth
of
the
patient
another
theory
was
that
the
devil
entered
human
beings
during
sleep
and
at
a
comparatively
recent
period
a
king
of
spain
was
wont
to
sleep
between
two
monks
to
keep
off
the
devil

the
devil

into
the
mouth
while
eating

the
monasteries
were
frequent
sources
of
that
form
of
mental
disease
which
was
supposed
to
be
caused
by
bewitchment
from
the
earliest
period
it
is
evident
that
monastic
life
tended
to
develop
insanity
such
cases
as
that
of
anthony
are
typical
of
its
effects
upon
the
strongest
minds
but
it
was
especially
the
convents
for
women
that
became
the
great
of
this
disease
among
the
large
numbers
of
women
and
girls
thus
assembled
many
of
them
forced
into
monastic
seclusion
against
their
will
for
the
reason
that
their
families
could
give
them
no

subjected
to
the
unsatisfied
longings
suspicions
bickerings
petty
jealousies
envies
and
hatreds
so
inevitable
in
convent
life
mental
disease
was
not
unlikely
to
be
developed
at
any
moment
hysterical
excitement
in
nunneries
took
shapes
sometimes
comical
but
more
generally
tragical
noteworthy
is
it
that
the
last
places
where
executions
for
witchcraft
took
place
were
mainly
in
the
neighbourhood
of
great
nunneries
and
the
last
famous
victim
of
the
myriads
executed
in
germany
for
this
imaginary
crime
was

the
impulse

undoubtedly
produced
an
atmosphere

the
year
in
the
midst
of
demonstrations
of
demoniacal
possession
by
the
most
eminent
theologians
and
judges
who
sat
in
their
robes
and
looked
wise
while
women
shrieking
praying
and
blaspheming
were
put
to
the
torture
a
man
arose
who
dared
to
protest
effectively
that
some
of
the
persons
thus
charged
might
be
simply
insane
and
this
man
was
john
wier
of
cleves
his
protest
does
not
at
this
day
strike
us
as
particularly
bold
in
his
books
de
praestigiis
daemonum
and
de
lamiis
he
did
his
best
not
to
offend
religious
or
theological
susceptibilities
but
he
felt
obliged
to
call
attention
to
the
mingled
fraud
and
delusion
of
those
who
claimed
to
be
bewitched
and
to
point
out
that
it
was
often
not
their
accusers
but
the
alleged
witches
themselves
who
were
really
ailing
and
to
urge
that
these
be
brought
first
of
all
to
a
physician
his
book
was
at
once
attacked
by
the
most
eminent
theologians
one
of
the
greatest
laymen
of
his
time
jean
bodin
also
wrote
with
especial
power
against
it
and
by
a
plentiful
use
of
scriptural
texts
gained
to
all
appearance
a
complete
victory
this
superstition
seemed
thus
fastened
upon
europe
for
a
thousand
years
more
but
doubt
was
in
the
air
and
about
a
quarter
of
a
century
after
the
publication
of
book
there
were
published
in
france
the
essays
of
a
man
by
no
means
so
noble
but
of
far
greater
genius
michel
de
montaigne
the
general
scepticism
which
his
work
promoted
among
the
french
people
did
much
to
produce
an
atmosphere
in
which
the
belief
in
witchcraft
and
demoniacal
possession
must
inevitably
wither
but
this
process
though
real
was
hidden
and
the
victory
still
seemed
on
the
theological
side
the
development
of
the
new
truth
and
its
struggle
against
the
old
error
still
went
on
in
holland
balthazar
bekker
wrote
his
book
against
the
worst
forms
of
the
superstition
and
attempted
to
help
the
scientific
side
by
a
text
from
the
second
epistle
of
peter
showing
that
the
devils
had
been
confined
by
the
almighty
and
therefore
could
not
be
doing
on
earth
the
work
which
was
imputed
to
them
but
protestant
brethren
drove
him
from
his
pulpit
and
he
narrowly
escaped
with
his
life
the
last
struggles
of
a
great
superstition
are
very
frequently
the
worst
so
it
proved
in
this
case
in
the
first
half
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
cruelties
arising
from
the
old
doctrine
were
more
numerous
and
severe
than
ever
before
in
spain
sweden
italy
and
above
all
in
germany
we
see
constant
efforts
to
suppress
the
evolution
of
the
new
truth
but
in
the
midst
of
all
this
reactionary
rage
glimpses
of
right
reason
began
to
appear
it
is
significant
that
at
this
very
time
when
the
old
superstition
was
apparently
everywhere
triumphant
the
declaration
by
poulet
that
he
and
his
brother
and
his
cousin
had
by
smearing
themselves
with
ointment
changed
themselves
into
wolves
and
devoured
children
brought
no
severe
punishment
upon
them
the
judges
sent
him
to
a
more
and
more
in
spite
of
frantic
efforts
from
the
pulpit
to
save
the
superstition
great
writers
and
jurists
especially
in
france
began
to
have
glimpses
of
the
truth
and
courage
to
uphold
it
malebranche
spoke
against
the
delusion
seguier
led
the
french
courts
to
annul
several
decrees
condemning
sorcerers
the
great
chancellor
declared
to
the
parliament
of
paris
that
if
they
wished
to
stop
sorcery
they
must
stop
talking
about
it
that
sorcerers
are
more
to
be
pitied
than
blamed
see

but
just
at
this
time
as
the
eighteenth
century
was
approaching
the
theological
current
was
strengthened
by
a
great
ecclesiastic
the
greatest
theologian
that
france
has
produced
whose
influence
upon
religion
and
upon
the
mind
of
louis
xiv
was
enormous
bossuet
bishop
of
meaux
there
had
been
reason
to
expect
that
bossuet
would
at
least
do
something
to
mitigate
the
superstition
for
his
writings
show
that
in
much
which
before
his
day
had
been
ascribed
to
diabolic
possession
he
saw
simple
lunacy
unfortunately
the
same
adherence
to
the
literal
interpretation
of
scripture
which
led
him
to
oppose
every
other
scientific
truth
developed
in
his
time
led
him
also
to
attack
this
he
delivered
and
published
two
great
sermons
which
while
showing
some
progress
in
the
form
of
his
belief
showed
none
the
less
that
the
fundamental
idea
of
diabolic
possession
was
still
to
be
tenaciously
held
what
this
idea
was
may
be
seen
in
one
typical
statement
he
declared
that
a
single
devil
could
turn
the
earth
round
as
easily
as
we
turn
a
marble
see
the
two
sermons
sur
les
demons
which
are
virtually
but
two
versions
of

the
final
struggle
and
victory
of
pinel
and
tuke
the
theological
current
thus
seemed
to
become
again
irresistible
but
it
was
only
so
in
appearance
in
spite
of
it
french
scepticism
continued
to
develop
signs
of
quiet
change
among
the
mass
of
thinking
men
were
appearing
more
and
more
and
in
came
one
of
great
significance
for
the
parliament
of
rouen
having
doomed
fourteen
sorcerers
to
be
burned
their
execution
was
delayed
for
two
years
evidently
on
account
of
scepticism
among
officials
and
at
length
the
great
minister
of
louis
xiv
colbert
issued
an
edict
checking
such
trials
and
ordering
the
convicted
to
be
treated
for
madness
victory
seemed
now
to
incline
to
the
standard
of
science
and
in
no
less
a
personage
than
andre
a
court
physician
dared
to
publish
a
work
virtually
showing
demoniacal
possession
to
be
lunacy
the
french
philosophy
from
the
time
of
its
early
development
in
the
eighteenth
century
under
montesquieu
and
voltaire
naturally
strengthened
the
movement
the
results
of
examinations
of
the
brains
of
the
possessed
confirmed
it
and
in
we
see
it
take
form
in
a
declaration
by
the
parliament
of
paris
that
possessed
persons
were
to
be
considered
as
simply
diseased
still
the
old
belief
lingered
on
its
life
flickering
up
from
time
to
time
in
those
parts
of
france
most
under
ecclesiastical
control
until
in
these
last
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
a
blow
has
been
given
it
by
the
researches
of
charcot
and
his
compeers
which
will
probably
soon
extinguish
it
one
evidence
of
satanic
intercourse
with
mankind
especially
on
which
for
many
generations
theologians
had
laid
peculiar
stress
and
for
which
they
had
condemned
scores
of
little
girls
and
hundreds
of
old
women
to
a
most
cruel
death
was
found
to
be
nothing
more
than
one
of
the
many
results
of
hysteria

colbert

in

the
same
warfare
went
on
john
locke
had
asserted
the
truth
but
the
theological
view
continued
to
control
public
opinion
most
prominent
among
those
who
exercised
great
power
in
its
behalf
was
john
wesley
and
the
strength
and
beauty
of
his
character
made
his
influence
in
this
respect
all
the
more
unfortunate
the
same
servitude
to
the
mere
letter
of
scripture
which
led
him
to
declare
that
to
give
up
witchcraft
is
to
give
up
the
bible
controlled
him
in
regard
to
insanity
he
insisted
on
the
authority
of
the
old
testament
that
bodily
diseases
are
sometimes
caused
by
devils
and
upon
the
authority
of
the
new
testament
that
the
gods
of
the
heathen
are
demons
he
believed
that
dreams
while
in
some
cases
caused
by
bodily
conditions
and
passions
are
shown
by
scripture
to
be
also
caused
by
occult
powers
of
evil
he
cites
a
physician
to
prove
that
most
lunatics
are
really
demoniacs
in
his
great
sermon
on
evil
angels
he
dwells
upon
this
point
especially
resists
the
idea
that
possession
may
be
epilepsy
even
though
ordinary
symptoms
of
epilepsy
be
present
protests
against
giving
up
to
infidels
such
proofs
of
an
invisible
world
as
are
to
be
found
in
diabolic
possession
and
evidently
believes
that
some
who
have
been
made
hysterical
by
his
own
preaching
are
possessed
of
satan
on
all
this
and
much
more
to
the
same
effect
he
insisted
with
all
the
power
given
to
him
by
his
deep
religious
nature
his
wonderful
familiarity
with
the
scriptures
his
natural
acumen
and
his
eloquence
but
here
too
science
continued
its
work
the
old
belief
was
steadily
undermined
an
atmosphere
favourable
to
the
truth
was
more
and
more
developed
and
the
act
of
parliament
in
which
banished
the
crime
of
witchcraft
from
the
statute
book
was
the
beginning
of
the
end
in
germany
we
see
the
beginnings
of
a
similar
triumph
for
science
in
prussia
that
sturdy
old
monarch
frederick
william
i
nullified
the
efforts
of
the
more
zealous
clergy
and
orthodox
jurists
to
keep
up
the
old
doctrine
in
his
dominions
throughout
protestant
germany
where
it
had
raged
most
severely
it
was
as
a
rule
cast
out
of
the
church
formulas
catechisms
and
hymns
and
became
more
and
more
a
subject
for
jocose
allusion
from
force
of
habit
and
for
the
sake
of
consistency
some
of
the
more
conservative
theologians
continued
to
repeat
the
old
arguments
and
there
were
many
who
insisted
upon
the
belief
as
absolutely
necessary
to
ordinary
orthodoxy
but
it
is
evident
that
it
had
become
a
mere
conventionality
that
men
only
believed
that
they
believed
it
and
now
a
reform
seemed
possible

treatment

in

the
government
set
antonio
haen
at
making
careful
researches
into
the
causes
of
diabolic
possession
he
did
not
think
it
best
in
view
of
the
power
of
the
church
to
dispute
the
possibility
or
probability
of
such
cases
but
simply
decided
after
thorough
investigation
that
out
of
the
many
cases
which
had
been
brought
to
him
not
one
supported
the
belief
in
demoniacal
influence
an
attempt
was
made
to
follow
up
this
examination
and
much
was
done
by
men
like
francke
and
van
swieten
and
especially
by
the
reforming
emperor
joseph
ii
to
rescue
men
and
women
who
would
otherwise
have
fallen
victims
to
the
prevalent
superstition
unfortunately
joseph
had
arrayed
against
himself
the
whole
power
of
the
church
and
most
of
his
good
efforts
seemed
brought
to
naught
but
what
the
noblest
of
the
old
race
of
german
emperors
could
not
do
suddenly
the
german
men
of
science
did
gradually
quietly
and
thoroughly
by
proofs
that
could
not
be
gainsaid
they
recovered
the
old
scientific
fact
established
in
pagan
greece
and
rome
that
madness
is
simply
physical
disease
but
they
now
established
it
on
a
basis
that
can
never
again
be
shaken
for
in
examinations
of
large
numbers
of
possessed
persons
they
found
evidence
of
typical
is
a
case
at
hamburg
in
an
afflicted
woman
showed
in
a
high
degree
all
the
recognised
characteristics
of
diabolic
possession
exorcisms
preachings
and
sanctified
remedies
of
every
sort
were
tried
in
vain
milder
medical
means
were
then
tried
and
she
so
far
recovered
that
she
was
allowed
to
take
the
communion
before
she
died
the
autopsy
held
in
the
presence
of
fifteen
physicians
and
a
public
notary
showed
it
to
be
simply
a
case
of
chronic
meningitis
the
work
of
german
men
of
science
in
this
field
is
noble
indeed
a
great
succession
from
wier
to
virchow
have
erected
a
barrier
against

of

the

superior

were
among

results

the
discussion
of
that
folly
by
calef
struck
it
a
severe
blow
and
a
better
influence
spread
rapidly
throughout
the
colonies
by
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
belief
in
diabolic
possession
had
practically
disappeared
from
all
enlightened
countries
and
during
the
nineteenth
century
it
has
lost
its
hold
even
in
regions
where
the
medieval
spirit
continues
strongest
throughout
the
middle
ages
as
we
have
seen
satan
was
a
leading
personage
in
the
but
in
the
bavarian
government
refused
to
allow
the
passion
play
at
if
satan
was
permitted
to
take
any
part
in
it
in
spite
of
heroic
efforts
to
maintain
the
old
belief
even
the
childlike
faith
of
the
tyrolese
had
arrived
at
a
point
which
made
a
representation
of
satan
simply
a
thing
to
provoke
laughter
very
significant
also
was
the
trial
which
took
place
at
wemding
in
southern
germany
in
a
boy
had
become
hysterical
and
the
capuchin
father
aurelian
tried
to
exorcise
him
and
charged
a
peasant
wife
frau
herz
with
bewitching
him
on
evidence
that
would
have
cost
the
woman
her
life
at
any
time
during
the
seventeenth
century
thereupon
the
woman
husband
brought
suit
against
father
aurelian
for
slander
the
latter
urged
in
his
defence
that
the
boy
was
possessed
of
an
evil
spirit
if
anybody
ever
was
that
what
had
been
said
and
done
was
in
accordance
with
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
church
as
laid
down
in
decrees
formulas
and
rituals
sanctioned
by
popes
councils
and
innumerable
bishops
during
ages
all
in

the
court
condemned
the
good
father
to
fine
and
imprisonment
as
in
a
famous
english
case
hell
was
dismissed
with
costs
even
more
significant
is
the
fact
that
recently
a
boy
declared
by
two
bavarian
priests
to
be
possessed
by
the
devil
was
taken
after
all

exorcisms

the
especial
point
to
be
noted
is
that

the
of

day
satan
and
his
works
have
disappeared
the

was
unable
to
detect
in

play
at
in
the
slightest
reference
to
diabolic
interference
with
the
course

main

these
representations
for
twenty
years
before
and
in
none
of
these
was
there
an
apparent
survival
of
the
old
belief
but
although
the
old
superstition
had
been
discarded
the
inevitable
conservatism
in
theology
and
medicine
caused
many
old
abuses
to
be
continued
for
years
after
the
theological
basis
for
them
had
really
disappeared
there
still
lingered
also
a
feeling
of
dislike
toward
madmen
engendered
by
the
early
feeling
of
hostility
toward
them
which
sufficed
to
prevent
for
many
years
any
practical
reforms
what
that
old
theory
had
been
even
under
the
most
favourable
circumstances
and
among
the
best
of
men
we
have
seen
in
the
fact
that
sir
thomas
more
ordered
acknowledged
lunatics
to
be
publicly
flogged
and
it
will
be
remembered
that
shakespeare
makes
one
of
his
characters
refer
to
madmen
as
deserving
a
dark
house
and
a
whip
what
the
old
practice
was
and
continued
to
be
we
know
but
too
well
taking
protestant
england
as
an
example
and
it
was
probably
the
most
humane
we
have
a
chain
of
testimony
toward
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
bethlehem
hospital
was
reported
too
loathsome
for
any
man
to
enter
in
the
seventeenth
century
john
evelyn
found
it
no
better
in
the
eighteenth
hogarth
pictures
and
contemporary
reports
show
it
to
be
essentially
what
it
had
been
in
those
previous
centuries

thomas

the
condition
of
bedlam

one
of
the
passages
of
shakespeare
is
in
as

like
it
act

scene
as
to
the
survival
of
indifference
to
the
sufferings
of
the
insane
so
long

generally

the
older
english
practice
is
thus
quaintly
described
by
richard
carew
in
his
survey
of
cornwall
london
in
our
daies
when
devotion
as
much
exceeded
knowledge
as
knowledge
now
commeth
short
of
devotion
there
were
many
bowssening
places
for
curing
of
mad
men
and
amongst
the
rest
one
at
alternunne
in
this
hundred
called
nunnespoole
which
saints
altar
it
may
be
gave
name
to
the
church
the
watter
running
from
nunnes
well
fell
into
a
square
and
close
walled
plot
which
might
bee
filled
at
what
depth
they
listed
vpon
this
wall
was
the
franticke
person
set
to
stand
his
backe
towards
the
poole
and
from
thence
with
a
sudden
blow
in
the
brest
tumbled
headlong
into
the
pond
where
a
strong
fellowe
provided
for
the
nonce
tooke
him
and
tossed
him
vp
and
downe
alongst
and
athwart
the
water
vntill
the
patient
by
forgoing
strength
had
somewhat
forgot
his
fury
then
there
was
hee
conveyed
to
the
church
and
certain
masses
sung
over
him
vpon
which
handling
if
his
right
wits
returned
nunne
had
the
thanks
but
if
there
appeared
any
small
amendment
he
was
bowsened
againe
and
againe
while
there
remayned
in
him
any
hope
of
life
for
recovery
the
first
humane
impulse
of
any
considerable
importance
in
this
field
seems
to
have
been
aroused
in
america
in
the
year
certain
members
of
the
society
of
friends
founded
a
small
hospital
for
the
insane
on
better
principles
in
pennsylvania
to
use
the
language
of
its
founders
it
was
intended
as
a
good
work
acceptable
to
god
twenty
years
later
virginia
established
a
similar
asylum
and
gradually
others
appeared
in
other
colonies
but
it
was
in
france
that
mercy
was
to
be
put
upon
a
scientific
basis
and
was
to
lead
to
practical
results
which
were
to
convert
the
world
to
humanity
in
this
case
as
in
so
many
others
from
france
was
spread
and
popularized
not
only
the
scepticism
which
destroyed
the
theological
theory
but
also
the
devotion
which
built
up
the
new
scientific
theory
and
endowed
the
world
with
a
new
treasure
of
civilization
in
some
physicians
of
the
great
hospital
at
paris
known
as
the
protested
that
the
cruelties
prevailing
in
the
treatment
of
the
insane
were
aggravating
the
disease
and
some
protests
followed
from
other
quarters
little
effect
was
produced
at
first
but
just
before
the
french
revolution
tenon
la
and
others
took
up
the
subject
and
in
a
commission
was
appointed
to
undertake
a
reform
by
great
good
fortune
the
man
selected
to
lead
in
the
movement
was
one
who
had
already
thrown
his
heart
into
it
jean
baptiste
pinel
in
pinel
was
made
physician
at
bicetre
one
of
the
most
extensive
lunatic
asylums
in
france
and
to
the
work
there
imposed
upon
him
he
gave
all
his
powers
little
was
heard
of
him
at
first
the
most
terrible
scenes
of
the
french
revolution
were
drawing
nigh
but
he
laboured
on
modestly
and
devotedly
apparently
without
a
thought
of
the
great
political
storm
raging
about
him
his
first
step
was
to
discard
utterly
the
whole
theological
doctrine
of
possession
and
especially
the
idea
that
insanity
is
the
result
of
any
subtle
spiritual
influence
he
simply
put
in
practice
the
theory
that
lunacy
is
the
result
of
bodily
disease
it
is
a
curious
matter
for
reflection
that
but
for
this
sway
of
the
destructive
philosophy
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
of
the
terrorists
during
the
french
revolution
pinel
blessed
work
would
in
all
probability
have
been
thwarted
and
he
himself
excommunicated
for
heresy
and
driven
from
his
position
doubtless
the
same
efforts
would
have
been
put
forth
against
him
which
the
church
a
little
earlier
had
put
forth
against
inoculation
as
a
remedy
for
smallpox
but
just
at
that
time
the
great
churchmen
had
other
things
to
think
of
besides
crushing
this
particular
heretic
they
were
too
much
occupied
in
keeping
their
own
heads
from
the
guillotine
to
give
attention
to
what
was
passing
in
the
head
of
pinel
he
was
allowed
to
work
in
peace
and
in
a
short
time
the
reign
of
diabolism
at
bicetre
was
ended
what
the
exorcisms
and
fetiches
and
prayers
and
processions
and
drinking
of
holy
water
and
ringing
of
bells
had
been
unable
to
accomplish
during
eighteen
hundred
years
he
achieved
in
a
few
months
his
method
was
simple
for
the
brutality
and
cruelty
which
had
prevailed
up
to
that
time
he
substituted
kindness
and
gentleness
the
possessed
were
taken
out
of
their
dungeons
given
sunny
rooms
and
allowed
the
liberty
of
pleasant
ground
for
exercise
chains
were
thrown
aside
at
the
same
time
the
mental
power
of
each
patient
was
developed
by
its
fitting
exercise
and
disease
was
met
with
remedies
sanctioned
by
experiment
observation
and
reason
thus
was
gained
one
of
the
greatest
though
one
of
the
least
known
triumphs
of
modern
science
and
humanity
the
results
obtained
by
pinel
had
an
instant
effect
not
only
in
france
but
throughout
europe
the
news
spread
from
hospital
to
hospital
at
his
death
esquirol
took
up
his
work
and
in
the
place
of
the
old
training
of
judges
torturers
and
executioners
by
theology
to
carry
out
its
ideas
in
cruelty
there
was
now
trained
a
school
of
physicians
to
develop
science
in
this
field
and
carry
out
its
decrees
in
mercy
for
the
services
of
tenon
and
his
associates
and
also
for
the
work
of
pinel
see
especially
esquirol
des
maladies
mentales
paris
vol
i
and
for
the
general
subject
and
the
condition
of
the
hospitals
at
this
period
see
dagron
as
above
a
similar
evolution
of
better
science
and
practice
took
place
in
england
in
spite
of
the
coldness
and
even
hostility
of
the
greater
men
in
the
established
church
and
notwithstanding
the
scriptural
demonstrations
of
wesley
that
the
majority
of
the
insane
were
possessed
of
devils
the
scientific
method
steadily
gathered
strength
in
the
condition
of
the
insane
began
to
attract
especial
attention
it
was
found
that
were
swayed
by
ideas
utterly
indefensible
and
that
the
practices
engendered
by
these
ideas
were
monstrous
as
a
rule
the
patients
were
immured
in
cells
and
in
many
cases
were
chained
to
the
walls
in
others
flogging
and
starvation
played
leading
parts
and
in
some
cases
the
patients
were
killed
naturally
enough
john
howard
declared
in
that
he
found
in
constantinople
a
better
insane
asylum
than
the
great
luke
hospital
in
london
well
might
he
do
so
for
ever
since
caliph
omar
had
protected
and
encouraged
the
scientific
investigation
of
insanity
by
paul
of
aegina
the
moslem
treatment
of
the
insane
had
been
far
more
merciful
than
the
system
prevailing
throughout
christendom
see
tuke
as
above
also
trelat
as
already
cited
in
the
same
year
in
which
pinel
began
his
great
work
in
france
william
tuke
began
a
similar
work
in
england
there
seems
to
have
been
no
connection
between
these
two
reformers
each
wrought
independently
of
the
other
but
the
results
arrived
at
were
the
same
so
too
in
the
main
were
their
methods
and
in
the
little
house
of
william
tuke
at
york
began
a
better
era
for
england
the
name
which
this
little
asylum
received
is
a
monument
both
of
the
old
reign
of
cruelty
and
of
the
new
reign
of
humanity
every
old
name
for
such
an
asylum
had
been
made
odious
and
repulsive
by
ages
of
misery
in
a
happy
moment
of
inspiration
tuke
gentle
quaker
wife
suggested
a
new
name
and
in
accordance
with
this
suggestion
the
place
became
known
as
a
retreat
from
the
great
body
of
influential
classes
in
church
and
state
tuke
received
little
aid
the
influence
of
the
theological
spirit
was
shown
when
in
that
same
year
pangster
published
his
observations
on
mental
disorders
and
after
displaying
much
ignorance
as
to
the
causes
and
nature
of
insanity
summed
up
by
saying
piously
here
our
researches
must
stop
and
we
must
declare
that
are
the
works
of
the
lord
and
his
ways
past
finding
out
such
seemed
to
be
the
view
of
the
church
at
large
though
the
new
retreat
was
at
one
of
the
two
great
ecclesiastical
centres
of
england
we
hear
of
no
aid
or
encouragement
from
the
archbishop
of
york
or
from
his
clergy
nor
was
this
the
worst
the
indirect
influence
of
the
theological
habit
of
thought
and
ecclesiastical
prestige
was
displayed
in
the
edinburgh
review
that
great
organ
of
opinion
not
content
with
attacking
tuke
poured
contempt
upon
his
work
as
well
as
on
that
of
pinel
a
few
of
tuke
brother
and
sister
quakers
seem
to
have
been
his
only
reliance
and
in
a
letter
regarding
his
efforts
at
that
time
he
says
all
men
seem
to
desert
me
see
tuke
as
above
and
also
the
edinburgh
review
for
april
in
this
atmosphere
of
english
conservative
opposition
or
indifference
the
work
could
not
grow
rapidly
as
late
as
a
member
of
parliament
stigmatized
the
insane
asylums
of
england
as
the
shame
of
the
nation
and
even
as
late
as
and
in
a
few
cases
as
late
as
there
were
revivals
of
the
old
absurdity
and
brutality
down
to
a
late
period
in
the
hospitals
of
luke
and
bedlam
long
rows
of
the
insane
were
chained
to
the
walls
of
the
corridors
but
gardner
at
lincoln
donnelly
at
hanwell
and
a
new
school
of
practitioners
in
mental
disease
took
up
the
work
of
tuke
and
the
victory
in
england
was
gained
in
practice
as
it
had
been
previously
gained
in
theory
there
need
be
no
controversy
regarding
the
comparative
merits
of
these
two
benefactors
of
our
race
pinel
and
tuke
they
clearly
did
their
thinking
and
their
work
independently
of
each
other
and
thereby
each
strengthened
the
other
and
benefited
mankind
all
that
remains
to
be
said
is
that
while
france
has
paid
high
honours
to
pinel
as
to
one
who
did
much
to
free
the
world
from
one
of
its
most
cruel
superstitions
and
to
bring
in
a
reign
of
humanity
over
a
wide
empire
england
has
as
yet
made
no
fitting
commemoration
of
her
great
benefactor
in
this
field
york
minster
holds
many
tombs
of
men
of
whom
some
were
blessings
to
their
while
some
were
but
solemnly
constituted
impostors
and
parasites
upon
the
body
politic
yet
to
this
hour
that
great
temple
has
received
no
consecration
by
a
monument
to
the
man
who
did
more
to
alleviate
human
misery
than
any
other
who
has
ever
entered
it
but
the
place
of
these
two
men
in
history
is
secure
they
stand
with
grotius
thomasius
and
beccaria
the
men
who
in
modern
times
have
done
most
to
prevent
unmerited
sorrow
they
were
not
indeed
called
to
suffer
like
their
great
compeers
they
were
not
obliged
to
see
their
writings
among
the
most
blessed
gifts
of
god
to
man
condemned
as
were
those
of
grotius
and
beccaria
by
the
catholic
church
and
those
of
thomasius
by
a
large
section
of
the
protestant
church
they
were
not
obliged
to
flee
for
their
lives
as
were
grotius
and
thomasius
but
their
effort
is
none
the
less
worthy
the
french
revolution
indeed
saved
pinel
and
the
decay
of
english
ecclesiasticism
gave
tuke
his
opportunity
but
their
triumphs
are
none
the
less
among
the
glories
of
our
race
for
they
were
the
first
acknowledged
victors
in
a
struggle
of
science
for
humanity
which
had
lasted
nearly
two
thousand
years
chapter
xvi
from
diabolism
to
hysteria
i
the
epidemics
of
possession
in
the
foregoing
chapter
i
have
sketched
the
triumph
of
science
in
destroying
the
idea
that
individual
lunatics
are
possessed
by
devils
in
establishing
the
truth
that
insanity
is
physical
disease
and
in
substituting
for
superstitious
cruelties
toward
the
insane
a
treatment
mild
kindly
and
based
upon
ascertained
facts
the
satan
who
had
so
long
troubled
individual
men
and
women
thus
became
extinct
henceforth
his
fossil
remains
only
were
preserved
they
may
still
be
found
in
the
sculptures
and
storied
windows
of
medieval
churches
in
sundry
liturgies
and
in
popular
forms
of
speech
but
another
satan
still
lived
a
satan
who
wrought
on
a
larger
scale
who
took
possession
of
multitudes
for
after
this
triumph
of
the
scientific
method
there
still
remained
a
class
of
mental
disorders
which
could
not
be
treated
in
asylums
which
were
not
yet
fully
explained
by
science
and
which
therefore
gave
arguments
of
much
apparent
strength
to
the
supporters
of
the
old
theological
view
these
were
the
epidemics
of
diabolic
possession
which
for
so
many
centuries
afflicted
various
parts
of
the
world
when
obliged
then
to
retreat
from
their
old
position
in
regard
to
individual
cases
of
insanity
the
more
conservative
theologians
promptly
referred
to
these
epidemics
as
beyond
the
domain
of
science
as
clear
evidences
of
the
power
of
satan
and
as
the
basis
of
this
view
they
cited
from
the
old
testament
frequent
references
to
witchcraft
and
from
the
new
testament
paul
question
as
to
the
possible
bewitching
of
the
galatians
and
the
bewitching
of
the
people
of
samaria
by
simon
the
magician
naturally
such
leaders
had
very
many
adherents
in
that
class
so
large
in
all
times
who
find
that
to
follow
foolish
precedents
and
wink
with
both
our
eyes
is
easier
than
to
think
as
to
eminent
physicians
finding
a
in
hysterical
mania
see
kirchhoff
article
cited
in
previous
chapter
it
must
be
owned
that
their
case
seemed
strong
though
in
all
human
history
so
far
as
it
is
closely
known
these
phenomena
had
appeared
and
though
every
classical
scholar
could
recall
the
wild
orgies
of
the
priests
priestesses
and
devotees
of
dionysus
and
cybele
and
the
epidemic
of
wild
rage
which
took
its
name
from
some
of
these
the
great
fathers
and
doctors
of
the
church
had
left
a
complete
answer
to
any
scepticism
based
on
these
facts
they
simply
pointed
to
declaration
that
the
gods
of
the
heathen
were
devils
these
examples
then
could
be
transformed
into
a
powerful
argument
for
diabolic
possession
as
to
the
maenads
corybantes
and
the
disease

strength
to
the
theological
view
and
from
these
i
shall
present
a
chain
of
typical
examples
as
early
as
the
eleventh
century
we
find
clear
accounts
of
diabolical
possession
taking
the
form
of
epidemics
of
raving
jumping
dancing
and
convulsions
the
greater
number
of
the
sufferers
being
women
and
children
in
a
time
so
rude
accounts
of
these
manifestations
would
rarely
receive
permanent
record
but
it
is
very
significant
that
even
at
the
beginning
of
the
eleventh
century
we
hear
of
them
at
the
extremes
of
europe
in
northern
germany
and
in
southern
italy
at
various
times
during
that
century
we
get
additional
glimpses
of
these
exhibitions
but
it
is
not
until
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
that
we
have
a
renewal
of
them
on
a
large
scale
in
at
erfurt
a
jumping
disease
and
dancing
mania
afflicted
a
hundred
children
many
of
whom
died
in
consequence
it
spread
through
the
whole
region
and
fifty
years
later
we
hear
of
it
in
holland
but
it
was
the
last
quarter
of
the
fourteenth
century
that
saw
its
greatest
manifestations
there
was
abundant
cause
for
them
it
was
a
time
of
oppression
famine
and
pestilence
the
crusading
spirit
having
run
its
course
had
been
succeeded
by
a
wild
mystical
fanaticism
the
most
frightful
plague
in
human
history
the
black
death
was
depopulating
whole
regions
reducing
cities
to
villages
and
filling
europe
with
that
strange
mixture
of
devotion
and
dissipation
which
we
always
note
during
the
prevalence
of
deadly
epidemics
on
a
large
scale
it
was
in
this
ferment
of
religious
moral
and
social
disease
that
there
broke
out
in
in
the
lower
rhine
region
the
greatest
perhaps
of
all
manifestations
of
possession
an
epidemic
of
dancing
jumping
and
wild
raving
the
cures
resorted
to
seemed
on
the
whole
to
intensify
the
disease
the
afflicted
continued
dancing
for
hours
until
they
fell
in
utter
exhaustion
some
declared
that
they
felt
as
if
bathed
in
blood
some
saw
visions
some
prophesied
into
this
mass
of
possession
there
was
also
clearly
poured
a
current
of
scoundrelism
which
increased
the
disorder
the
immediate
source
of
these
manifestations
seems
to
have
been
the
wild
revels
of
john
day
in
those
revels
sundry
old
heathen
ceremonies
had
been
perpetuated
but
under
a
nominally
christian
form
wild
bacchanalian
dances
had
thus
become
a
ceremonial
the
religious
and
social
atmosphere
was
propitious
to
the
development
of
the
germs
of
diabolic
influence
vitalized
in
these
orgies
and
they
were
scattered
far
and
wide
through
large
tracts
of
the
netherlands
and
germany
and
especially
through
the
whole
region
of
the
rhine
at
cologne
we
hear
of
five
hundred
afflicted
at
once
at
metz
of
eleven
hundred
dancers
in
the
streets
at
strasburg
of
yet
more
painful
manifestations
and
from
these
and
other
cities
they
spread
through
the
villages
and
rural
districts
the
great
majority
of
the
sufferers
were
women
but
there
were
many
men
and
especially
men
whose
occupations
were
sedentary
remedies
were
tried
upon
a
large
first
but
especially
pilgrimages
to
the
shrine
of
vitus
the
exorcisms
accomplished
so
little
that
popular
faith
in
them
grew
small
and
the
main
effect
of
the
pilgrimages
seemed
to
be
to
increase
the
disorder
by
subjecting
great
crowds
to
the
diabolic
contagion
yet
another
curative
means
was
seen
in
the
flagellant
processions
vast
crowds
of
men
women
and
children
who
wandered
through
the
country
screaming
praying
beating
themselves
with
whips
imploring
the
divine
mercy
and
the
intervention
of
vitus
most
fearful
of
all
the
main
attempts
at
cure
were
the
persecutions
of
the
jews
a
feeling
had
evidently
spread
among
the
people
at
large
that
the
almighty
was
filled
with
wrath
at
the
toleration
of
his
enemies
and
might
be
propitiated
by
their
destruction
in
the
principal
cities
and
villages
of
germany
then
the
jews
were
plundered
tortured
and
murdered
by
tens
of
thousands
no
doubt
that
in
all
this
greed
was
united
with
fanaticism
but
the
argument
of
fanaticism
was
simple
and
cogent
the
dart
which
pierced
the
breast
of
israel
at
that
time
was
winged
and
pointed
from
its
own
sacred
books
the
biblical
argument
was
the
same
used
in
various
ages
to
promote
persecution
and
this
was
that
the
wrath
of
the
almighty
was
stirred
against
those
who
tolerated
his
enemies
and
that
because
of
this
toleration
the
same
curse
had
now
come
upon
europe
which
the
prophet
samuel
had
denounced
against
saul
for
showing
mercy
to
the
enemies
of
jehovah
it
is
but
just
to
say
that
various
popes
and
kings
exerted
themselves
to
check
these
cruelties
although
the
argument
of
samuel
to
saul
was
used
with
frightful
effect
two
hundred
years
later
by
a
most
conscientious
pope
in
spurring
on
the
rulers
of
france
to
extirpate
the
huguenots
the
papacy
in
the
fourteenth
century
stood
for
mercy
to
the
jews
but
even
this
intervention
was
long
without
effect
the
tide
of
popular
superstition
had
become
too
strong
to
be
curbed
even
by
the
spiritual
and
temporal
powers

ventured
to

this

to

cases
of

on

began
to
be
brought
within
the
scope
of
medical
research
and
the
man
who
led
in
this
evolution
of
medical
science
was
paracelsus
he
it
was
who
first
bade
modern
europe
think
for
a
moment
upon
the
idea
that
these
diseases
are
inflicted
neither
by
saints
nor
demons
and
that
the
dancing
possession
is
simply
a
form
of
disease
of
which
the
cure
may
be
effected
by
proper
remedies
and
regimen
paracelsus
appears
to
have
escaped
any
serious
interference
it
took
some
time
perhaps
for
the
theological
leaders
to
understand
that
he
had
let
a
new
idea
loose
upon
the
planet
but
they
soon
understood
it
and
their
course
was
simple
for
about
fifty
years
the
new
idea
was
well
kept
under
but
in
another
physician
john
wier
of
cleves
revived
it
at
much
risk

his

although
the
new
idea
was
thus
resisted
it
must
have
taken
some
hold
upon
thoughtful
men
for
we
find
that
in
the
second
half
of
the
same
century
the
vitus
dance
and
forms
of
demoniacal
possession
akin
to
it
gradually
diminished
in
frequency
and
were
sometimes
treated
as
diseases
in
the
seventeenth
century
so
far
as
the
north
of
europe
is
concerned
these
displays
of
possession
on
a
great
scale
had
almost
entirely
ceased
here
and
there
cases
appeared
but
there
was
no
longer
the
wild
rage
extending
over
great
districts
and
afflicting
thousands
of
people
yet
it
was
as
we
shall
see
in
this
same
seventeenth
century
in
the
last
expiring
throes
of
this
superstition
that
it
led
to
the
worst
acts
of
cruelty

there
too
epidemics
of
dancing

seized
groups
and
communities
but
they
were
attributed
to
a
physical
cause
the
theory
being
that
the
bite
of
a
tarantula
in
some
way
provoked
a
supernatural
intervention
of
which
dancing
was
the
accompaniment
and
cure
in
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
fracastoro
made
an
evident
impression
on
the
leaders
of
italian
opinion
by
using
medical
means
in
the
cure
of
the
possessed
though
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
the
medicine
which
he
applied
successfully
was
such
as
we
now
know
could
not
by
any
direct
effects
of
its
own
accomplish
any
cure
whatever
effect
it
exerted
was
wrought
upon
the
imagination
of
the
sufferer
this
form
of
possession
then
passed
out
of
the
supernatural
domain
and
became
known
as
tarantism
though
it
continued
much
longer
than
the
corresponding
manifestations
in
northern
europe
by
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
it
had
nearly
disappeared
and
though
special
manifestations
of
it
on
a
small
scale
still
break
out
occasionally
its
main
survival
is
the
tarantella
which
the
traveller

danced
at

a

and
following
but
long
before
this
form
of
possession
had
begun
to
disappear
there
had
arisen
new
manifestations
apparently
more
inexplicable
as
the
first
great
epidemics
of
dancing
and
jumping
had
their
main
origin
in
a
religious
ceremony
so
various
new
forms
had
their
principal
source
in
what
were
supposed
to
be
centres
of
religious
life
in
the
convents
and
more
especially
in
those
for
women
out
of
many
examples
we
may
take
a
few
as
typical
in
the
fifteenth
century
the
chroniclers
assure
us
that
an
inmate
of
a
german
nunnery
having
been
seized
with
a
passion
for
biting
her
companions
her
mania
spread
until
most
if
not
all
of
her
began
to
bite
each
other
and
that
this
passion
for
biting
passed
from
convent
to
convent
into
other
parts
of
germany
into
holland
and
even
across
the
alps
into
italy
so
too
in
a
french
convent
when
a
nun
began
to
mew
like
a
cat
others
began
mewing
the
disease
spread
and
was

checked
by
severe
measures

power

alarm
spread
until
at
last
even
jovial
sceptical
king
henry
iv
was
disquieted
and
the
reigning
pope
was
asked
to
take
measures
to
ward
off
the
evil
fortunately
there
then
sat
in
the
episcopal
chair
of
angers
a
prelate
who
had
apparently
imbibed
something
of
montaigne
scepticism
miron
and
when
the
case
was
brought
before
him
he
submitted
it
to
the
most
of
sacred
tests
he
first
brought
into
the
girl
presence
two
bowls
one
containing
holy
water
the
other
ordinary
spring
water
but
allowed
her
to
draw
a
false
inference
regarding
the
contents
of
each
the
result
was
that
at
the
presentation
of
the
holy
water
the
devils
were
perfectly
calm
but
when
tried
with
the
ordinary
water
they
threw
martha
into
convulsions
the
next
experiment
made
by
the
shrewd
bishop
was
to
similar
purpose
he
commanded
loudly
that
a
book
of
exorcisms
be
brought
and
under
a
previous
arrangement
his
attendants
brought
him
a
copy
of
virgil
no
sooner
had
the
bishop
begun
to
read
the
first
line
of
the
aeneid
than
the
devils
threw
martha
into
convulsions
on
another
occasion
a
latin
dictionary
which
she
had
reason
to
believe
was
a
book
of
exorcisms
produced
a
similar
effect
although
the
bishop
was
thereby
led
to
pronounce
the
whole
matter
a
mixture
of
insanity
and
imposture
the
capuchin
monks
denounced
this
view
as
godless
they
insisted
that
these
tests
really
proved
the
presence
of
satan
showing
his
cunning
in
covering
up
the
proofs
of
his
existence
the
people
at
large
sided
with
their
preachers
and
martha
was
taken
to
paris
where
various
exorcisms
were
tried
and
the
parisian
mob
became
as
devoted
to
her
as
they
had
been
twenty
years
before
to
the
murderers
of
the
huguenots
as
they
became
two
centuries
later
to
robespierre
and
as
they
more
recently
were

bishop
miron
was
not
the
only
sceptic

of

charged
the
most
eminent
physicians
of
the
city
and
among
them
riolan
to
report
upon
the
case
various
examinations
were
made
and
the
verdict
was
that
martha
was
simply
a
hysterical
impostor
thanks
then
to
medical
science
and
to
these
two
enlightened
ecclesiastics
who
summoned

aid

or
a
hundred

persons

been
condemned
to

public
opinion
was
strong
enough
to
secure
a

examination

having

largely

a

twenty
years
later
a
far
more
striking
case
occurred
at
loudun
in
western
france
where
a
convent
of
ursuline
nuns
was
afflicted
by
demons
the
convent
was
filled

with

birth

not

what
this
work
was
may
be
seen
throughout
the
middle
ages
but
it
is
especially
in
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
that
we
find
it
frequently
taking
shape
in
outbursts
of
diabolic
possession

near
the
convent
dwelt
a
priest
urbain
grandier
noted
for
his
brilliancy
as
a
writer
and
preacher
but
careless
in
his
way
of
living
several
of
the
nuns
had
evidently
conceived
a
passion
for
him
and
in
their
wild
rage
and
despair
dwelt
upon
his
name
in
the
same
city
too
were
sundry
ecclesiastics
and
laymen
with
whom
grandier
had
fallen
into
petty
neighbourhood
quarrels
and
some
of
these
men
held
the
main
control
of
the
convent
out
of
this
mixture
of
possession
within
the
convent
and
malignity
without
it
came
a
charge
that
grandier
had
bewitched
the
young
women
the
bishop
of
poictiers
took
up
the
matter
a
trial
was
held
and
it
was
noted
that
whenever
grandier
appeared
the
possessed
screamed
shrieked
and
showed
every
sign
of
diabolic
influence
grandier
fought
desperately
and
appealed
to
the
archbishop
of
bordeaux
de
sourdis
the
archbishop
ordered
a
more
careful
examination
and
on
separating
the
nuns
from
each
other
and
from
certain
monks
who
had
been
bitterly
hostile
to
grandier
such
glaring
discrepancies
were
found
in
their
testimony
that
the
whole
accusation
was
brought
to
naught
but
the
enemies
of
satan
and
of
grandier
did
not
rest
through
their
efforts
cardinal
richelieu
who
appears
to
have
had
an
old
grudge
against
grandier
sent
a
representative
laubardemont
to
make
another
investigation
most
frightful
scenes
were
now
enacted
the
whole
convent
resounded
more
loudly
than
ever
with
shrieks
groans
howling
and
cursing
until
finally
grandier
though
even
in
the
agony
of
torture
he
refused
to
confess
the
crimes
that
his
enemies
suggested
was
hanged
and
burned
from
this
centre
the
epidemic
spread
multitudes
of
women
and
men
were
affected
by
it
in
various
convents
several
of
the
great
cities
of
the
south
and
west
of

came
under
the
same

the
possession
went
on
for
several
years
longer
and
then
gradually
died

occurred

toward
the
end
of
the

century
similar
manifestations
began
to
appear
on
a
large
scale
in
america
the
life
of
the
early
colonists
in
new
england
was
such
as
to
give
rapid
growth
to
the
germs
of
the
doctrine
of
possession
brought
from
the
mother
country
surrounded
by
the
dark
pine
forests
having
as
their
neighbours
indians
who
were
more
than
suspected
of
being
children

by

beasts
apparently
sent

the
powers
of

to
torment
the

to
while
away
the
long
winter
evenings
with
few
amusements
save
neighbourhood
quarrels
dwelling
intently
on
every
text
of
scripture
which
supported
their
gloomy
theology
and
adopting
its
most
literal
interpretation
it
is
not
strange
that
they
rapidly
developed
ideas
regarding
the
darker
side
of
nature
for
the
idea
that
america
before
the
pilgims
had
been
especially
given
over
to
satan

of
the

this
fear
of
witchcraft
received
a
powerful
stimulus
from
the
treatises
of
learned
men
such
works
coming
from
europe
which
was
at
that
time
filled
with
the
superstition
acted
powerfully
upon
conscientious
preachers
and
were
brought
by
them
to
bear
upon
the
people
at
large
naturally
then
throughout
the
latter
half
of
the
seventeenth
century
we
find
scattered
cases
of
diabolic
possession
at
boston
springfield
hartford
groton
and
other
towns
cases
occurred
and
here
and
there
we

quarter

began

this

influence
there

came

of
no

children

of

began
leaping
and
barking
like

or
purring
like
cats
and
complaining
of
being
pricked
pinched
and
cut
and
to
help
the
matter
an
old
irishwoman
was
tried
and
executed
all
this
belief
might
have
passed
away
like
a
troubled
dream
had
it
not
become
incarnate
in
a
strong

this
man
was
cotton

deeply
religious
possessed
of
excellent
abilities
a
great
scholar
anxious
to
promote
the
welfare
of
his
flock
in
this
world
and
in
the
next
he
was
far
in
advance
of
ecclesiastics
generally
on
nearly
all
the
main
questions
between
science
and
theology
he
came
out
of
his
earlier
superstition
regarding
the
divine
origin
of
the
hebrew
punctuation
he
opposed
the
old
theologic
idea
regarding
the
taking
of
interest
for
money
he
favoured
inoculation
as
a
preventive
of
smallpox
when
a
multitude
of
clergymen
and
laymen
opposed
it
he
accepted
the
newtonian
astronomy
despite
the
outcries
against
its
atheistic
tendency
he
took
ground
against
the
dogma
that
comets
are
signs
and
wonders
he
had
indeed
some
of
the
defects
of
his
qualities
and
among
them
pedantic
vanity
pride
of
opinion
and
love
of
power
but
he
was
for
his
time
remarkably
liberal
and
undoubtedly
sincere
he
had
thrown
off
a
large
part
of
his
father
theology
but
one
part
of
it
he
could
not
throw
off
he
was
one
of
the
best
biblical
scholars
of
his
time
and
he
could
not
break
away
from
the
fact
that
the
sacred
scriptures
explicitly
recognise
witchcraft
and
demoniacal
possession
as
realities
and
enjoin
against
witchcraft
the
penalty
of
death
therefore
it
was
that
in
he
published
his
memorable
providences
relating
to
witchcrafts
and
possessions
the
book
according
to
its
was
recommended
by
the
ministers
of
boston
and
charleston
and
its
stories
soon
became
the
familiar
reading
of
men
women
and
children
throughout
new
england
out
of
all
these
causes
thus
brought
to
bear
upon
public
opinion
began
in
a
new
outbreak
of
possession
which
is
one
of
the
most
instructive
in
history
the
rev
samuel
parris
was
the
minister
of
the
church
in
salem
and
no
pope
ever
had
higher
ideas
of
his
own
infallibility
no
bishop
a
greater
love
of
ceremony
no
inquisitor
a
greater

for
prying
and
spying
for
curious
examples
of
this
see

vol

before
long
parris
had
much
upon
his
hands
many
of
his
hardy
independent
parishioners
disliked
his
ways
quarrels
arose
some
of
the
leading
men
of
the
congregation
were
pitted
against
him
the
previous
minister
george
burroughs
had
left
the
germs
of
troubles
and
quarrels
and
to
these
were
now
added
new
complications
arising
from
the
assumptions
of
parris
there
were
innumerable
wranglings
and
lawsuits
in
fact
all
the
essential
causes
for
satanic
interference
which
we
saw
at
work
in
and
about
the
monastery
at
loudun
and
especially
the
turmoil
of
a
petty
village
where
there
is
no
intellectual
activity
and
where
men
and
women
find
their
chief
substitute
for
it
in
squabbles
religious
legal
political
social
and
personal
in
the
darkened
atmosphere
thus
charged
with
the
germs
of
disease
it
was
suddenly
discovered
that
two
young
girls
in
the
family
of
parris
were
possessed
of
devils
they
complained
of
being
pinched
pricked
and
cut
fell
into
strange
spasms
and
made
strange
speeches
showing
the
signs
of
diabolic
possession
handed
down
in
fireside
legends
or
dwelt
upon
in
popular
witch
literature
and
especially
such
as
had
lately
been
described
by
cotton
mather
in
his
book
on
memorable
providences
the
two
girls
having
been
brought
by
parris
and
others
to
tell
who
had
bewitched
them
first
charged
an
old
indian
woman
and
the
poor
old
indian
husband
was
led
to
join
in
the
charge
this
at
once
afforded
new
scope
for
the
activity
of
parris
magnifying
his
office
he
immediately
began
making
a
great
stir
in
salem
and
in
the
country
round
about
two
magistrates
were
summoned
with
them
came
a
crowd
and
a
court
was
held
at
the
the
scenes
which
then
took
place
would
have
been
the
richest
of
farces
had
they
not
led
to
events
so
tragical
the
possessed
went
into
spasms
at
the
approach
of
those
charged
with
witchcraft
and
when
the
poor
old
men
and
women
attempted
to
attest
their
innocence
they
were
overwhelmed
with
outcries
by
the
possessed
quotations
of
scripture
by
the
ministers
and
denunciations
by
the
mob
one
especially
ann
putnam
a
child
of
twelve
years
showed
great
precocity
and
played
a
striking
part
in
the
performances
the
mania
spread
to
other
children
and
two
or
three
married
women
also
seeing
the
great
attention
paid
to
the
afflicted
and
influenced
by
that
epidemic
of
morbid
imitation
which
science
now
recognises
in
all
such
cases
soon
became
similarly
afflicted
and
in
their
turn
made
charges
against
various
persons
the
indian
woman
was
flogged
by
her
master
parris
until
she
confessed
relations
with
satan
and
others
were
forced
or
deluded
into
confession
these
hysterical
confessions
the
results
of
unbearable
torture
or
the
reminiscences
of
dreams
which
had
been
prompted
by
the
witch
legends
and
sermons
of
the
period
embraced
such
facts
as
flying
through
the
air
to
witch
gatherings
partaking
of
witch
sacraments
signing
a
book
presented
by
the
devil
and
submitting
to
satanic
baptism
the
possessed
had
begun
with
charging
their
possession
upon
poor
and
vagrant
old
women
but
ere
long
emboldened
by
their
success
they
attacked
higher
game
struck
at
some
of
the
foremost
people
of
the
region
and
did
not
cease
until
several
of
these
were
condemned
to
death
and
every
man
woman
and
child
brought
under
a
reign
of
terror
many
fled
outright
and
one
of
the
foremost
citizens
of
salem
went
constantly
armed
and
kept
one
of
his
horses
saddled
in
the
stable
to
flee
if
brought
under
accusation
the
hysterical
ingenuity
of
the
possessed
women
grew
with
their
success
they
insisted
that
they
saw
devils
prompting
the
accused
to
defend
themselves
in
court
did
one
of
the
accused
clasp
her
hands
in
despair
the
possessed
clasped
theirs
did
the
accused
in
appealing
to
heaven
make
any
gesture
the
possessed
simultaneously
imitated
it
did
the
accused
in
weariness
drop
her
head
the
possessed
dropped
theirs
and
declared
that
the
witch
was
trying
to
break
their
necks
the
resounded
with
groans
shrieks
prayers
and
curses
judges
jury
and
people
were
aghast
and
even
the
accused
were
sometimes
thus
led
to
believe
in
their
own
guilt
very
striking
in
all
these
cases
was
the
alloy
of
frenzy
with
trickery
in
most
of
the
madness
there
was
method
sundry
witches
charged
by
the
possessed
had
been
engaged
in
controversy
with
the
salem
church
people
others
of
the
accused
had
quarrelled
with
parris
still
others
had
been
engaged
in
old
lawsuits
against
persons
more
or
less
connected
with
the
girls
one
of
the
most
fearful
charges
which
cost
the
life
of
a
noble
and
lovely
woman
arose
undoubtedly
from
her
better
style
of
dress
and
living
old
slumbering
neighbourhood
or
personal
quarrels
bore
in
this
way
a
strange
fruitage
of
revenge
for
the
cardinal
doctrine
of
a
fanatic
creed
is
that
his
enemies
are
the
enemies
of
god
any
person
daring
to
hint
the
slightest
distrust
of
the
proceedings
was
in
danger
of
being
immediately
brought
under
accusation
of
a
league
with
satan
husbands
and
children
were
thus
brought
to
the
gallows
for
daring
to
disbelieve
these
charges
against
their
wives
and
mothers
some
of
the
clergy
were
accused
for
endeavouring
to
save
members
of
their
churches
this
is
admirably
brought
out
by
upham
and
the
lawyerlike
thoroughness
with
which
he
has
examined
all
these
hidden
springs
of
the
charges
is
one
of
the
main
things
which
render
his
book
one
of
the
most
valuable
contributions
to
the
history
and
philosophy
of
demoniacal
possession
ever
written
one
poor
woman
was
charged
with
giving
a
look
toward
the
great
of
salem
and
immediately
a
demon
entered
the
house
and
tore
down
a
part
of
it
this
cause
for
the
falling
of
a
bit
of
poorly
nailed
wainscoting
seemed
perfectly
satisfactory
to
cotton
mather
as
well
as
to
the
judge
and
jury
and
she
was
hanged
protesting
her
innocence
still
another
lady
belonging
to
one
of
the
most
respected
families
of
the
region
was
charged
with
the
crime
of
witchcraft
the
children
were
fearfully
afflicted
whenever
she
appeared
near
them
it
seemed
never
to
occur
to
any
one
that
a
bitter
old
feud
between
the
rev
parris
and
the
family
of
the
accused
might
have
prejudiced
the
children
and
directed
their
attention
toward
the
woman
no
account
was
made
of
the
fact
that
her
life
had
been
entirely
blameless
and
yet
in
view
of
the
wretched
insufficiency
of
proof
the
jury
brought
in
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
as
they
brought
in
this
verdict
all
the
children
began
to
shriek
and
scream
until
the
court
committed
the
monstrous
wrong
of
causing
her
to
be
indicted
anew
in
order
to
warrant
this
the
judge
referred
to
one
perfectly
natural
and
harmless
expression
made
by
the
woman
when
under
examination
the
jury
at
last
brought
her
in
guilty
she
was
condemned
and
having
been
brought
into
the
church
heavily
ironed
was
solemnly
excommunicated
and
delivered
over
to
satan
by
the
minister
some
good
sense
still
prevailed
and
the
governor
reprieved
her
but
ecclesiastical
pressure
and
popular
clamour
were
too
powerful
the
governor
was

to
recall

and
executed
at
the
last
moment
he
repeated
the
lord
prayer
solemnly
and
fully
which
it
was
supposed
that
no
sorcerer
could
do
and
this
together
with
his
straightforward
christian
utterances
at
the
execution
shook
the
faith
of
many
in
the
reality
of
diabolic
possession
ere
long
it
was
known
that
one
of
the
girls
had
acknowledged
that
she
had
belied
some
persons
who
had
been
executed
and
especially
burroughs
and
that
she
had
begged
forgiveness
but
this
for
a
time
availed
nothing
persons
who
would
not
confess
were
tied
up
and
put
to
a
sort
of
torture
which
was
effective
in
securing
new
revelations
in
the
case
of
giles
corey
the
horrors
of
the
persecution
culminated
seeing
that
his
doom
was
certain
and
wishing
to
preserve
his
family
from
attainder
and
their
property
from
confiscation
he
refused
to
plead
though
eighty
years
of
age
he
was
therefore
pressed
to
death
and
when
in
his
last
agonies
his
tongue
was
pressed
out
of
his
mouth
the
sheriff
with
his
thrust
it
back
again
everything
was
made
to
contribute
to
the
orthodox
view
of
possession
on
one
occasion
when
a
cart
conveying
eight
condemned
persons
to
the
place
of
execution
stuck
fast
in
the
mire
some
of
the
possessed
declared
that
they
saw
the
devil
trying
to
prevent
the
punishment
of
his
associates
confessions
of
witchcraft
abounded
but
the
way
in
which
these
confessions
were
obtained
is
touchingly
exhibited
in
a
statement
afterward
made
by
several
women
in
explaining
the
reasons
why
when
charged
with
afflicting
sick
persons
they
made
a
false
confession
they
said
by
reason
of
that
suddain
surprizal
we
knowing
ourselves
altogether
innocent
of
that
crime
we
were
all
exceedingly
astonished
and
amazed
and
consternated
and
affrighted
even
out
of
our
reason
and
our
nearest
and
dearest
relations
seeing
us
in
that
dreadful
condition
and
knowing
our
great
danger
apprehending
that
there
was
no
other
way
to
save
our
lives
out
of
tender
pitty
persuaded
us
to
confess
what
we
did
confess
and
indeed
that
confession
that
it
is
said
we
made
was
no
other
than
what
was
suggested
to
us
by
some
gentlemen
they
telling
us
that
we
were
witches
and
they
knew
it
and
we
knew
it
and
they
knew
that
we
knew
it
which
made
us
think
that
it
was
so
and
our
understanding
our
reason
and
our
faculties
almost
gone
we
were
not
capable
of
judging
our
condition
as
also
the
hard
measures
they
used
with
us
rendered
us
uncapable
of
making
our
defence
but
said
anything
and
everything
which
they
desired
and
most
of
what
we
said
was
in
effect
a
consenting
to
what
they
said
see
calef
in
drake

ii
also
upham
case
after
case
in
which
hysteria
fanaticism
cruelty
injustice
and
trickery
played
their
part
was
followed
up
to
the
scaffold
in
a
short
time
twenty
persons
had
been
put
to
a
cruel
death
and
the
number
of
the
accused
grew
larger
and
larger
the
highest
position
and
the
noblest
character
formed
no
barrier
daily
the
possessed
became
more
bold
more
tricky
and
more
wild
no
plea
availed
anything
in
behalf
of
several
women
whose
lives
had
been
of
the
purest
and
gentlest
petitions
were
presented
but
to
no
effect
a
scriptural
text
was
always
ready
to
aid
in
the
repression
of
mercy
it
was
remembered
that
satan
himself
is
transformed
into
an
angel
of
light
and
above
all
resounded
the
old
testament
injunction
which
had
sent
such
multitudes
in
europe
to
the
and
the
stake
thou
shalt
not
suffer
a
witch
to
live
such
clergymen
as
noyes
parris
and
mather
aided
by
such
judges
as
stoughton
and
hathorn
left
nothing
undone
to
stimulate
these
proceedings
the
great
cotton
mather
based
upon
this
outbreak
of
disease
thus
treated
his
famous
book
wonders
of
the
invisible
world
thanking
god
for
the
triumphs
over
satan
thus
gained
at

and
his
book
received
the
approbation
of
the
governor
of
the
province
the
president
of
harvard
college
and
various
eminent
theologians
in
europe
as
well
as
in
america
but
despite
such
efforts
as
these

and
thought
upon
observation
which
form
the
beginning
of
all
true
science
brought
in
a
new
order
of
things
the
people
began
to
fall
away
justice
bradstreet
having
committed
thirty
or
forty
persons
became
aroused
to
the
absurdity
of
the
whole
matter
the
minister
of

the
good
sense
to
resist
the
theological
view
even
so
high
a
personage
as
lady
phips
the

of
the
governor
began
to
show
lenity
each
of
these
was
in
consequence
of
this
disbelief
charged
with
collusion
with
satan
but
such
charges
seemed
now
to
lose
their
force
in
the
midst
of
all
this
delusion
and
terrorism
stood
cotton
mather
firm
as
ever
his
efforts
to
uphold
the
declining
superstition
were
heroic
but
he
at
last
went
one
step
too
far
being
himself
possessed
of
a
mania
for
and
and
having
described
a
case
of
witchcraft
with
possibly
greater
exaggeration
than
usual
he
was
confronted
by
robert
calef
calef
was
a
boston
merchant
who
appears
to
have
united
the
good
sense
of
a
man
of
business
to
considerable
shrewdness
in
observation
power
in
thought
and
love
for
truth
and
he
began
writing
to
mather
and
others
to
show
the
weak
points
in
the
system
mather
indignant
that
a
person
so
much
his
inferior
dared
dissent
from
his
opinion
at
first
affected
to
despise
calef
but
as
calef
pressed
him
more
and
more
closely
mather
denounced
him
calling
him
among
other
things
a
coal
from
hell
all
to
no
purpose
calef
fastened
still
more
firmly
upon
the
flanks
of
the
great
theologian
thought
and
reason
now
began
to
resume
their
sway
the
possessed
having
accused
certain
men
held
in
very
high
respect
doubts
began
to
dawn
upon
the
community
at
large
here
was
the
repetition
of
that
which
had
set
men
thinking
in
the
german
bishoprics
when
those
under
trial
for
witchcraft
there
had
at
last
in
their
desperation
or
madness
charged
the
very
bishops
and
the
judges
upon
the
bench
with
sorcery
the
party
of
reason
grew
stronger
the
rev
parris
was
soon
put
upon
the
defensive
for
some
of
the
possessed
began
to
confess
that
they
had
accused
people
wrongfully
herculean
efforts
were
made
by
certain
of
the
clergy
and
devout
laity
to
support
the
declining
belief
but
the
more
thoughtful
turned
more
and
more
against
it
jurymen
prominent
in
convictions
solemnly
retracted
their
verdicts
and
publicly
craved
pardon
of
god
and
man
most
striking
of
all
was
the
case
of
justice
sewall
a
man
of
the
highest
character
he
had
in
view
of
authority
deduced
from
scripture
and
the
principles
laid
down
by
the
great
english
judges
unhesitatingly
condemned
the
accused
but
reason
now
dawned
upon
him
he
looked
back
and
saw
the
baselessness
of
the
whole
proceedings
and
made
a
public
statement
of
his
errors
his
diary
contains
many
passages
showing
deep
contrition
and
ever
afterward
to
the
end
of
his
life
he
was
wont
on
one
day
in
the
year
to
enter
into
solitude
and
there
remain
all
the
day
long
in
fasting
prayer
and
penitence
stoughton
never
yielded
to
the
last
he
lamented
the
evil
spirit
of
unbelief
which
was
thwarting
the
glorious
work
of
freeing
new
england
from
demons
the
church
of
salem
solemnly
revoked
the
excommunications
of
the
condemned
and
drove
parris
from
the
pastorate
cotton
mather
passed
his
last
years
in
groaning
over
the
decline
of
the
faith
and
the
ingratitude
of
a
people
for
whom
he
had
done
so
much
very
significant
is
one
of
his
complaints
since
it
shows
the
evolution
of
a
more
scientific
mode
of
thought
abroad
as
well
as
at
home
he
laments
in
his
diary
that
english
publishers
gladly
printed
calef
book
but
would
no
longer
publish
his
own
and
he
declares
this
an
attack
upon
the
glory
of
the
lord
about
forty
years
after
the
new
england
epidemic
of
possession
occurred
another
typical
series
of
phenomena
in
france
in
there
died
at
the
french
capital
a
simple
and
kindly
ecclesiastic
the
archdeacon
paris
he
had
lived
a
pious
christian
life
and
was
endeared
to
multitudes
by
his
charity
unfortunately
he
had
espoused
the
doctrine
of
jansen
on
grace
and
free
will
and
though
he
remained
in
the
gallican
church
he
and
those
who
thought
like
him
were
opposed
by
the
jesuits
and
finally
condemned
by
a
papal
bull
his
remains
having
been
buried
in
the
cemetery
of
medard
the
jansenists
flocked
to
say
their
prayers
at
his
grave
and
soon
miracles
began
to
be
wrought
there
ere
long
they
were
multiplied
the
sick
being
brought
and
laid
upon
the
tombstone
many
were
cured
wonderful
stories
were
attested
by
the
tendency
the
passion
for
developing
enlarging
and
spreading
tales
of
wonder
came
into
full
play
and
was
given
free
course
many
thoughtful
men
satisfied
themselves
of
the
truth
of
these
representations
one
of
the
foremost
english
scholars
came
over
examined
into
them
and
declared
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
reality
of
the
cures
this
state
of
things
continued
for
about
four
years
when
in
more
violent
effects
showed
themselves
sundry
persons
approaching
the
tomb
were
thrown
into
convulsions
hysterics
and
catalepsy
these
diseases
spread
became
epidemic
and
soon
multitudes
were
similarly
afflicted
both
religious
parties
made
the
most
of
these
cases
in
vain
did
such
great
authorities
in
medical
science
as
hecquet
and
lorry
attribute
the
whole
to
natural
causes
the
theologians
on
both
sides
declared
them
supernatural
the
jansenists
attributing
them
to
god
the
jesuits
to
satan
of
late
years
such
cases
have
been
treated
in
france
with
much
shrewdness
when
about
the
middle
of
the
present
century
the
arab
priests
in
algiers
tried
to
arouse
fanaticism
against
the
french
christians
by
performing
miracles
the
french
government
instead
of
persecuting
the
priests
sent
the
most
renowned
juggler
of
his
time
to
the
scene
of
action
and
for
every
arab
miracle
houdin
performed
two
did
an
arab
marabout
turn
a
rod
into
a
serpent
houdin
turned
his
rod
into
two
serpents
and
afterward
showed
the
people
how
he
did
it
so
too
at
the
last
international
exposition
the
french
government
observing
the
evil
effects
produced
by
the
mania
for
table
turning
and
tipping
took
occasion
when
a
great
number
of
french
schoolmasters
and
teachers
were
visiting
the
exposition
to
have
public
lectures
given
in
which
all
the
business
of
dark
closets
materialization
of
spirits
presenting
the
faces
of
the
departed
and
ghostly
portraiture
was
fully
performed
by
professional
mountebanks
and
afterward
as
fully
explained
so
in
this
case
the
government
simply
ordered
the
gate
of
the
cemetery
to
be
locked
and
when
the
crowd
could
no
longer
approach
the
tomb
the
miracles
ceased
a
little
parisian
ridicule
helped
to
end
the
matter
a
wag
wrote
up
over
the
gate
of
the
cemetery
de
par
le
roi
defense
a
dieu
de
faire
des
miracles
dans
ce
lieu
which
being
translated
from
doggerel
french
into
doggerel
english
is
by
order
of
the
king
the
lord
must
forbear
to
work
any
more
of
his
miracles
here
but
the
theological
spirit
remained
powerful
the
french
revolution
had
not
then
intervened
to
bring
it
under
healthy
limits
the
agitation
was
maintained
and
though
the
miracles
and
cases
of
possession
were
stopped
in
the
cemetery
it
spread
again
full
course
was
given
to
and
the
retailing
of
wonders
it
was
said
that
men
had
allowed
themselves
to
be
roasted
before
slow
fires
and
had
been
afterward
found
uninjured
that
some
had
enormous
weights
piled
upon
them
but
had
supernatural
powers
of
resistance
given
them
and
that
in
one
case
a
voluntary
crucifixion
had
taken
place
this
agitation
was
long
troublesome
and
no
doubt
robbed
many
temporarily
or
permanently
of
such
little
brains
as
they
possessed
it
was
only
when
the
violence
had
become
an
old
story
and
the
charm
of
novelty
had
entirely
worn
off
and
the
afflicted
found
themselves
no
longer
regarded
with
especial
interest
that
the
epidemic
died
away

see

and

various
epidemics
of
this
sort
broke
out
from
time
to
time
in
other
parts
of
the
world
though
happily
as
modern
scepticism
prevailed
with
less
cruel
results
in
some
congregations
of
calvinistic
methodists
in
wales
became
so
fervent
that
they
began
leaping
for
joy
the
mania
spread
and
gave
rise
to
a
sect
called
the
jumpers
a
similar
outbreak
took
place
afterward
in
england
and
has
been
repeated
at
various
times
and
places
since
in
our
own
country
see
adam

of
all
religions
article
on
jumpers
also
hecker
in
came
another
outbreak
in
france
but
this
time
it
was
not
the
jansenists
who
were
affected
but
the
strictly
orthodox
a
large
number
of
young
girls
between
twelve
and
nineteen
years
of
age
having
been
brought
together
at
the
church
of
roch
in
paris
with
preaching
and
ceremonies
calculated
to
arouse
hysterics
one
of
them
fell
into
convulsions
immediately
other
children
were
similarly
taken
until
some
fifty
or
sixty
were
engaged
in
the
same
antics
this
mania
spread
to
other
churches
and
gatherings
proved
very
troublesome
and
in
some
cases
led
to
results
especially
painful
about
the
same
period
came
a
similar
outbreak
among
the
protestants
of
the
shetland
isles
a
woman
having
been
seized
with
convulsions
at
church
the
disease
spread
to
others
mainly
women
who
fell
into
the
usual
contortions
and
wild
shriekings
a
very
effective
cure
proved
to
be
a
threat
to
plunge
the
diseased
into
a
neighbouring
pond
ii
beginnings
of
helpful
scepticism
but
near
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
a
fact
very
important
for
science
was
established
it
was
found
that
these
manifestations
do
not
arise
in
all
cases
from
supernatural
sources
in
came
the
noted
case
at
hodden
bridge
in
lancashire
a
girl
working
in
a
cotton
manufactory
there
put
a
mouse
into
the
bosom
of
another
girl
who
had
a
great
dread
of
mice
the
girl
thus
treated
immediately
went
into
convulsions
which
lasted
hours
shortly
afterward
three
other
girls
were
seized
with
like
convulsions
a
little
later
six
more
and
then
others
until
in
all
were
attacked
then
came
a
fact
throwing
a
flood
of
light
upon
earlier
occurrences
this
epidemic
being
noised
abroad
soon
spread
to
another
factory
five
miles
distant
the
patients
there
suffered
from
strangulation
danced
tore
their
hair
and
dashed
their
heads
against
the
walls
there
was
a
strong
belief
that
it
was
a
disease
introduced
in
cotton
but
a
resident
physician
amused
the
patients
with
electric
shocks
and
the
disease
died
out
in
came
a
case
of
like
import
in
the
charite
hospital
in
berlin
a
girl
fell
into
strong
convulsions
the
disease
proved
contagious
several
others
becoming
afflicted
in
a
similar
way
but
nearly
all
were
finally
cured
principally
by
the
administration
of
opium
which
appears
at
that
time
to
have
been
a
fashionable
remedy
of
the
same
sort
was
a
case
at
lyons
in
sixty
women
were
working
together
in
a
shop
when
one
of
them
after
a
bitter
quarrel
with
her
husband
fell
into
a
violent
nervous
paroxysm
the
other
women
sympathizing
with
her
gathered
about
to
assist
her
but
one
after
another
fell
into
a
similar
condition
until
twenty
were
thus
prostrated
and
a
more
general
spread

while
these
cases
seemed
in
the
eye
of
science
fatal
to
the
old
conception
of
diabolic
influence
the
great
majority
of
such
epidemics
when
unexplained
continued
to
give
strength
to
the
older
view
in
roman
catholic
countries
these
manifestations
as
we
have
seen
have
generally
appeared
in
convents
or
in
churches
where
young
girls
are
brought
together
for
their
first
communion
or
at
shrines
where
miracles
are
supposed
to
be
wrought
in
protestant
countries
they
appear
in
times
of
great
religious
excitement
and
especially
when
large
bodies
of
young
women
are
submitted
to
the
influence
of
noisy
and
frothy
preachers
examples
of
this

are
seen
in

and
various

among

generally
a
congregation
composed
mainly
of
young
women
any
fanatic
or
overzealous
priest
or
preacher
may
stimulate
hysterical
seizures
which
are
very
likely
to
become
epidemic
as
a
recent
typical
example
on
a
large
scale
i
take
the
case
of
diabolic
possession
at
morzine
a
french
village
on
the
borders
of
switzerland
and
it
is
especially
instructive
because
it
was
thoroughly
investigated
by
a
competent
man
of
science
about
the
year
a
sick
girl
at
morzine
acting
strangely
was
thought
to
be
possessed
of
the
devil
and
was
taken
to
besancon
where
she
seems
to
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
kindly
and
sensible
ecclesiastics
and
under
the
operation
of
the
relics
preserved
in
the
cathedral
there
especially
the
handkerchief
of
christ
the
devil
was
cast
out
and
she
was
cured
naturally
much
was
said
of
the
affair
among
the
peasantry
and
soon
other
cases
began
to
show
themselves
the
priest
at
morzine
attempted
to
quiet
the
matter
by
avowing
his
disbelief
in
such
cases
of
possession
but
immediately
a
great
outcry
was
raised
against
him
especially
by
the
possessed
themselves
the
matter
was
now
widely
discussed
and
the
malady
spread
rapidly
and
began
amazing
accounts
were
thus
developed
and
sent
out
to
the
world
the
afflicted
were
said
to
have
climbed
trees
like
squirrels
to
have
shown
superhuman
strength
to
have
exercised
the
gift
of
tongues
speaking
in
german
latin
and
even
in
arabic
to
have
given
accounts
of
historical
events
they
had
never
heard
of
and
to
have
revealed
the
secret
thoughts
of
persons
about
them
mingled
with
such
exhibitions
of
power
were
outbursts
of
blasphemy
and
obscenity
but
suddenly
came
something
more
miraculous
apparently
than
all
these
wonders
without
any
assigned
cause
this
epidemic
of
possession
diminished
and
the
devil
disappeared
not
long
after
this
tissot
an
eminent
member
of
the
medical
faculty
at
dijon
visited
the
spot
and
began
a
series
of
researches
of
which
he
afterward
published
a
full
account
he
tells
us
that
he
found
some
reasons
for
the
sudden
departure
of
satan
which
had
never
been
published
he
discovered
that
the
government
had
quietly
removed
one
or
two
very
zealous
ecclesiastics
to
another
parish
had
sent
the
police
to
morzine
to
maintain
order
and
had
given
instructions
that
those
who
acted
outrageously
should
be
simply
treated
as
lunatics
and
sent
to
asylums
this
policy
so
accordant
with
french
methods
of
administration
cast
out
the
devil
the
possessed
were
mainly
cured
and
the
matter
appeared
ended
but
tissot
found
a
few
of
the
diseased
still
remaining
and
he
soon
satisfied
himself
by
various
investigations
and
experiments
that
they
were
simply
suffering
from
hysteria
one
of
his
investigations
is
especially
curious
in
order
to
observe
the
patients
more
carefully
he
invited
some
of
them
to
dine
with
him
gave
them
without
their
knowledge
holy
water
in
their
wine
or
their
food
and
found
that
it
produced
no
effect
whatever
though
its
results
upon
the
demons
when
the
possessed
knew
of
its
presence
had
been
very
marked
even
after
large
draughts
of
holy
water
had
been
thus
given
the
possessed
remained
afflicted
urged
that
the
devil
should
be
cast
out
and
some
of
them
even
went
into
convulsions
the
devil
apparently
speaking
from
their
mouths
it
was
evident
that
satan
had
not
the
remotest
idea
that
he
had
been
thoroughly
dosed
with
the
most
effective
medicine
known
to
the
older
theology
for
an
amazing
delineation
of
the
curative
and
other
virtues
of
holy
water
see
the
abbe
gaume
benite
au
xixme
siecle
paris
at
last
tissot
published
the
results
of
his
experiments
and
the
stereotyped
answer
was
soon
made
it
resembled
the
answer
made
by
the
clerical
opponents
of
galileo
when
he
showed
them
the
moons
of
jupiter
through
his
telescope
and
they
declared
that
the
moons
were
created
by
the
telescope
the
clerical
opponents
of
tissot
insisted
that
the
of
the
holy
water
upon
the
demons
proved
nothing
save
the
extraordinary
cunning
of
satan
that
the
archfiend
wished
it
to
be
thought
that
he
does
not
exist
and
so
overcame
his
repugnance
to
holy
water
gulping
it
down
in
order
to
conceal
his
presence
tissot
also
examined
into
the
gift
of
tongues
exercised
by
the
possessed
as
to
german
and
latin
no
great
difficulty
was
presented
it
was
by
no
means
hard
to
suppose
that
some
of
the
girls
might
have
learned
some
words
of
the
former
language
in
the
neighbouring
swiss
cantons
where
german
was
spoken
or
even
in
germany
itself
and
as
to
latin
considering
that
they
had
heard
it
from
their
childhood
in
the
church
there
seemed
nothing
very
wonderful
in
their
uttering
some
words
in
that
language
also
as
to
arabic
had
they
really
spoken
it
that
might
have
been
accounted
for
by
the
relations
of
the
possessed
with
zouaves
or
spahis
from
the
french
army
but
as
tissot
could
discover
no
such
relations
he
investigated
this
point
as
the
most
puzzling
of
all
on
a
close
inquiry
he
found
that
all
the
wonderful
examples
of
speaking
arabic
were
reduced
to
one
he
then
asked
whether
there
was
any
other
person
speaking
or
knowing
arabic
in
the
town
he
was
answered
that
there
was
not
he
asked
whether
any
person
had
lived
there
so
far
as
any
one
could
remember
who
had
spoken
or
understood
arabic
and
he
was
answered
in
the
negative
he
then
asked
the
witnesses
how
they
knew
that
the
language
spoken
by
the
girl
was
arabic
no
answer
was
vouchsafed
him
but
he
was
overwhelmed
with
such
stories
as
that
of
a
pig
which
at
sight
of
the
cross
on
the
village
church
suddenly
refused
to
go
farther
and
he
was
denounced
thoroughly
in
the
clerical
newspapers
for
declining
to
accept
such
evidence
at
tissot
visit
in
the
possession
had
generally
ceased
and
the
cases
left
were
few
and
quiet
but
his
visits
stirred
a
new
controversy
and
its
echoes
were
long
and
loud
in
the
pulpits
and
clerical
journals
believers
insisted
that
satan
had
been
removed
by
the
intercession
of
the
blessed
virgin
unbelievers
hinted
that
the
main
cause
of
the
deliverance
was
the
reluctance
of
the
possessed
to
be
shut
up
in
asylums
under
these
circumstances
the
bishop
of
annecy
announced
that
he
would
visit
morzine
to
administer
confirmation
and
word
appears
to
have
spread
that
he
would
give
a
more
orthodox
completion
to
the
work
already
done
by
exorcising
the
devils
who
remained
immediately
several
new
cases
of
possession
appeared
young
girls
who
had
been
cured
were
again
affected
the
embers
thus
kindled
were
fanned
into
a
flame
by
a
mission
which
sundry
priests
held
in
the
parish
to
arouse
the
people
to
their
religious
duties
a
mission
in
roman
catholic
countries
being
akin
to
a
revival
among
some
protestant
sects
multitudes
of
young
women
excited
by
the
preaching
and
appeals
of
the
clergy
were
again
thrown
into
the
old
disease
and
at
the
coming
of
the
good
bishop
it
culminated
the
account
is
given
in
the
words
of
an
at
the
solemn
entrance
of
the
bishop
into
the
church
the
possessed
persons
threw
themselves
on
the
ground
before
him
or
endeavoured
to
throw
themselves
upon
him
screaming
frightfully
cursing
blaspheming
so
that
the
people
at
large
were
struck
with
horror
the
possessed
followed
the
bishop
hooted
him
and
threatened
him
up
to
the
middle
of
the
church
order
was
only
established
by
the
intervention
of
the
soldiers
during
the
confirmation
the
diseased
redoubled
their
howls
and
infernal
vociferations
and
tried
to
spit
in
the
face
of
the
bishop
and
to
tear
off
his
pastoral
raiment
at
the
moment
when
the
prelate
gave
his
benediction
a
still
more
outrageous
scene
took
place
the
violence
of
the
diseased
was
carried
to
fury
and
from
all
parts
of
the
church
arose
yells
and
fearful
howling
so
frightful
was
the
din
that
tears
fell
from
the
eyes
of
many
of
the
spectators
and
many
strangers
were
thrown
into
consternation
among
the
very
large
number
of
these
diseased
persons
there
were
only
two
men
of
the
remainder
only
two
were
of
advanced
age
the
great
majority
were
young
women
between
the
ages
of
eighteen
and
years
the
public
authorities
shortly
afterward
intervened
and
sought
to
cure
the
disease
and
to
draw
the
people
out
of
their
mania
by
singing
dancing
and
sports
of
various
sorts
until
at
last
it
was
brought
under
control

scenes
similar
to
these
in
their
essential
character
have
arisen
more
recently
in
protestant
countries
but
with
the
difference
that
what
has
been
generally
attributed
by

catholic
ecclesiastics
to
satan
is
attributed
by
protestant
ecclesiastics
to
the
almighty
typical
among

greater
exhibitions
of
this
were
those
which
began
in
the
methodist
chapel
at

leaping

some
four
thousand

were

and
some
of

patients
were
so
seriously
affected
that
they
were
taken
to

another

these
exhibitions
are
seen

more
after

of

the
characteristics

mentioned

had

was
gradually
diminishing
this

among

to

boerhaave
finding
in

at

a
number
of
women
going
into
convulsions
and
imitating

in

immediately
ordered
a
furnace

blazing
coals
into

of

declared
that

these
and
similar
successful
dealings
of
medical
science
with
mental
disease
brought
about
the
next
stage
in
the
theological
development
the
church
sought
to
retreat
after
the
usual
manner
behind
a
compromise
early
in
the
eighteenth
century
appeared
a
new
edition
of
the
great
work
by
the
jesuit
delrio
which
for
a
hundred
years
had
been
a
for
the
use
of
ecclesiastics
in
fighting
witchcraft
but
in
this
edition
the
part
played
by
satan
in
diseases
was
changed
it
was
suggested
that
while
diseases
have
natural
causes
it
is
necessary
that
satan
enter
the
human
body
in
order
to
make
these
causes
effective
this
work
claims
that
satan
attacks
lunatics
at
the
full
moon
when
their
brains
are
full
of
humours
that
in
other
cases
of
illness
he
stirs
the
black
bile
and
that
in
cases
of
blindness
and
deafness
he
clogs
the
eyes
and
ears
by
the
close
of
the
century
this
restatement
was
evidently
found
untenable
and
one
of
a
very
different
sort
was
attempted
in
england
in
the
third
edition
of
the
encyclopaedia
britannica
published
in
under
the
article
daemoniacs
the
orthodox
view
was
presented
in
the
following
words
the
reality
of
demoniacal
possession
stands
upon
the
same
evidence
with
the
gospel
system
in
general
this
statement
though
necessary
to
satisfy
the
older
theological
sentiment
was
clearly
found
too
dangerous
to
be
sent
out
into
the
modern
sceptical
world
without
some
qualification
another
view
was
therefore
suggested
namely
that
the
personages
of
the
new
testament
adopted
the
vulgar
language
in
speaking
of
those
unfortunate
persons
who
were
generally
imagined
to
be
possessed
with
demons
two
or
three
editions
contained
this
curious
compromise
but
near
the
middle
of
the
present
century
the
whole
discussion
was
quietly
dropped
science
declining
to
trouble
itself
with
any
of
these
views
pressed
on
and
toward
the
end
of
the
century
we
see
rhodes
at
lyons
curing
a
very
serious
case
of
possession
by
the
use
of
a
powerful
emetic
yet
came
in
here
also
and
it
was
stated
that
when
the
emetic
produced
its
effect
people
had
seen
multitudes
of
green
and
yellow
devils
cast
forth
from
the
mouth
of
the
possessed
the
last
great
demonstration
of
the
old
belief
in
england
was
made
in
near
the
city
of
bristol
at
that
time
lived
a
drunken
epileptic
george
lukins
in
asking
alms
he
insisted
that
he
was
possessed
and
proved
it
by
jumping
screaming
barking
and
treating
the
company
to
a
parody
of
the
te
deum
he
was
solemnly
brought
into
the
temple
church
and
seven
clergymen
united
in
the
effort
to
exorcise
the
evil
spirit
upon
their
adjuring
satan
he
swore
by
his
infernal
den
that
he
would
not
come
out
of
the
man
an
oath
says
the
chronicler
nowhere
to
be
found
but
in
bunyan
pilgrim
progress
from
which
lukins
probably
got
it
but
the
seven
clergymen
were
at
last
successful
and
seven
devils
were
cast
out
after
which
lukins
retired
and
appears
to
have
been
supported
during
the
remainder
of
his
life
as
a
monument
of
mercy
with
this
great
effort
the
old
theory
in
england
seemed
practically
exhausted
science
had
evidently
carried
the
stronghold
in
at
a
little
town
near
amiens
in
france
a
young
woman
suffering
with
all
the
usual
evidences
of
diabolic
possession
was
brought
to
the
priest
the
priest
was
besought
to
cast
out
the
devil
but
he
simply
took
her
to
the
hospital
where
under
scientific
treatment
she
rapidly
became

the
final
triumph
of
science
in
this
part
of
the
great
field
has
been
mainly
achieved
during
the
latter
half
of
the
present
century
following
in
the
noble
succession
of
paracelsus
and
john
hunter
and
pinel
and
tuke
and
esquirol
have
come
a
band
of
thinkers
and
workers
who
by
scientific
observation
and
research
have
developed
new
growths
of
truth
ever
more
and
more
precious
among
the
many
facts
thus
brought
to
bear
upon
this
last
stronghold
of
the
prince
of
darkness
may
be
named

those
indicating
expectant
attention
an
expectation
of
phenomena
dwelt
upon
until
the
longing
for
them
becomes
morbid
and
invincible
and
the
creation
of
them
perhaps
unconscious
still
other
classes
of
phenomena
leading
to
epidemics
are
found
to
arise
from
a
morbid
tendency
to

periodically
for

past
we
have
seen
in

accounts
of
the
wonderful
performances
of

that
he
had

these
exhibitions
and
that
so
far
from
being
wonderful
they
were
much
inferior
to
the
jugglery
so
well
known
in
all
our
western
capitals
conscientious
men
still
linger
on
who
find
comfort
in
holding
fast
to
some
shred
of
the
old
belief
in
diabolic
possession
the
sturdy
declaration
in
the
last
century
by
john
wesley
that
giving
up
witchcraft
is
giving
up
the
bible
is
echoed
feebly
in
the
latter
half
of
this
century
by
the
eminent
catholic
ecclesiastic
in
france
who
declares
that
to
deny
possession
by
devils
is
to
charge
jesus
and
his
apostles
with
imposture
and
asks
how
can
the
testimony
of
apostles
fathers
of
the
church
and
saints
who
saw
the
possessed
and
so
declared
be
denied
and
a
still
fainter
echo
lingers
in
protestant
england
see
the
abbe

in
the

also
the

despite

science

in
this
field
to

from

i
the
sacred
theory
in
its
first
form
among
the
sciences
which
have
served
as
entering
wedges
into
the
heavy
mass
of
ecclesiastical
orthodoxy
to
cleave
it
disintegrate
it
and
let
the
light
of
christianity
into
it
none
perhaps
has
done
a
more
striking
work
than
comparative
philology
in
one
very
important
respect
the
history
of
this
science
differs
from
that
of
any
other
for
it
is
the
only
one
whose
conclusions
theologians
have
at
last
fully
adopted
as
the
result
of
their
own
studies
this
adoption
teaches
a
great
lesson
since
while
it
has
destroyed
theological
views
cherished
during
many
centuries
and
obliged
the
church
to
accept
theories
directly
contrary
to
the
plain
letter
of
our
sacred
books
the
result
is
clearly
seen
to
have
helped
christianity
rather
than
to
have
hurt
it
it
has
certainly
done
much
to
clear
our
religious
foundations
of
the
dogmatic
rust
which
was
eating
into
their
structure
how
this
result
was
reached
and
why
the
church
has
so
fully
accepted
it
i
shall
endeavour
to
show
in
the
present
chapter
at
a
very
early
period
in
the
evolution
of
civilization
men
began
to
ask
questions
regarding
language
and
the
answers
to
these
questions
were
naturally
embodied
in
the
myths
legends
and
chronicles
of
their
sacred
books
among
the
foremost
of
these
questions
were
three
whence
came
language
which
was
the
first
language
how
came
the
diversity
of
language
the
answer
to
the
first
of
these
was
very
simple
each
people
naturally
held
that
language
was
given
it
directly
or
indirectly
by
some
special
or
national
deity
of
its
own
thus
to
the
chaldeans
by
oannes
to
the
egyptians
by
thoth
to
the
hebrews
by
jahveh
the
hebrew
answer
is
embodied
in
the
great
poem
which
opens
our
sacred
books
jahveh
talks
with
adam
and
is
perfectly
understood
the
serpent
talks
with
eve
and
is
perfectly
understood
jahveh
brings
the
animals
before
adam
who
bestows
on
each
its
name
language
then
was
and
complete
of
the
fact
that
every
language
is
the
result
of
a
growth
process
there
was
evidently
among
the
compilers
of
our
sacred
books
no
suspicion
the
answer
to
the
second
of
these
questions
was
no
less
simple
as
very
generally
each
nation
believed
its
own
chief
divinity
to
be
a
god
above
all
gods
as
each
believed
itself
a
chosen
people
as
each
believed
its
own
sacred
city
the
actual
centre
of
the
earth
so
each
believed
its
own
language
to
be
the
first
the
original
of
all
this
answer
was
from
the
first
taken
for
granted
by
each
chosen
people
and
especially
by
the
hebrews
throughout
their
whole
history
whether
the
almighty
talks
with
adam
in
the
garden
or
writes
the
commandments
on
mount
sinai
he
uses
the
same
language
the
hebrew
the
answer
to
the
third
of
these
questions
that
regarding
the
diversity
of
languages
was
much
more
difficult
naturally
explanations
of
this
diversity
frequently
gave
rise
to
legends
somewhat
complicated
the
law
of
wills
and
causes
formulated
by
comte
was
exemplified
here
as
in
so
many
other
cases
that
law
is
that
when
men
do
not
know
the
natural
causes
of
things
they
simply
attribute
them
to
wills
like
their
own
thus
they
obtain
a
theory
which
provisionally
takes
the
place
of
science
and
this
theory
forms
a
basis
for
theology
examples
of
this
recur
to
any
thinking
reader
of
history
before
the
simpler
laws
of
astronomy
were
known
the
sun
was
supposed
to
be
trundled
out
into
the
heavens
every
day
and
the
stars
hung
up
in
the
firmament
every
night
by
the
right
hand
of
the
almighty
before
the
laws
of
comets
were
known
they
were
thought
to
be
missiles
hurled
by
an
angry
god
at
a
wicked
world
before
the
real
cause
of
lightning
was
known
it
was
supposed
to
be
the
work
of
a
good
god
in
his
wrath
or
of
evil
spirits
in
their
malice
before
the
laws
of
meteorology
were
known
it
was
thought
that
rains
were
caused
by
the
almighty
or
his
angels
opening
the
windows
of
heaven
to
let
down
upon
the
earth
the
waters
that
be
above
the
firmament
before
the
laws
governing
physical
health
were
known
diseases
were
supposed
to
result
from
the
direct
interposition
of
the
almighty
or
of
satan
before
the
laws
governing
mental
health
were
known
insanity
was
generally
thought
to
be
diabolic
possession
all
these
early
conceptions
were
naturally
embodied
in
the
sacred
books
of
the
world
and
especially
in
our
own
any
one
who
wishes
to
realize
the
mediaeval
view
of
the
direct
personal
attention
of
the
almighty
to
the
universe
can
perhaps
do
so
most
easily
by
looking
over
the
engravings
in
the
nuremberg
chronicle
representing
him
in
the
work
of
each
of
the
six
days
and
resting
afterward
so
in
this
case
to
account
for
the
diversity
of
tongues
the
direct
intervention
of
the
divine
will
was
brought
in
as
this
diversity
was
felt
to
be
an
inconvenience
it
was
attributed
to
the
will
of
a
divine
being
in
anger
to
explain
this
anger
it
was
held
that
it
must
have
been
provoked
by
human
sin
out
of
this
conception
explanatory
myths
and
legends
grew
as
thickly
and
naturally
as
elms
along
of
these
the
earliest
form
known
to
us
is
found
in
the
chaldean
accounts
and
nowhere
more
clearly
than
in
the
legend
of
the
tower
of
babel
the
inscriptions
recently
found
among
the
ruins
of
assyria
have
thrown
a
bright
light
into
this
and
other
scriptural
myths
and
legends
the
deciphering
of
the
characters
in
these
inscriptions
by
grotefend
and
the
reading
of
the
texts
by
george
smith
oppert
sayce
and
others
have
given
us
these
traditions
more
nearly
in
their
original
form
than
they
appear
in
our
own
scriptures
the
hebrew
story
of
babel
like
so
many
other
legends
in
the
sacred
books
of
the
world
combined
various
elements
by
a
play
upon
words
such
as
the
history
of
myths
and
legends
frequently
shows
it
wrought
into
one
fabric
the
earlier
explanations
of
the
diversities
of
human
speech
and
of
the
great
ruined
tower
at
babylon
the
name
babel
means
gate
of
god
or
gate
of
the
gods
all
modern
scholars
of
note
agree
that
this
was
the
real
significance
of
the
name
but
the
hebrew
verb
which
signifies
to
confound
resembles
somewhat
the
word
babel
so
that
out
of
this
resemblance
by
one
of
the
most
common
processes
in
myth
formation
came
to
the
hebrew
mind
an
indisputable
proof
that
the
tower
was
connected
with
the
confusion
of
tongues
and
this
became
part
of
our
theological
heritage
in
our
sacred
books
the
account
runs
as
follows
and
the
whole
earth
was
of
one
language
and
of
one
speech
and
it
came
to
pass
as
they
journeyed
from
the
east
that
they
found
a
plain
in
the
land
of
shinar
and
they
dwelt
there
and
they
said
one
to
another
go
to
let
us
make
brick
and
burn
them
thoroughly
and
they
had
brick
for
stone
and
slime
had
they
for
mortar
and
they
said
go
to
let
us
build
us
a
city
and
a
tower
whose
top
may
reach
unto
heaven
and
let
us
make
us
a
name
lest
we
be
scattered
abroad
upon
the
face
of
the
whole
earth
and
the
lord
came
down
to
see
the
city
and
the
tower
which
the
children
of
men
builded
and
the
lord
said
behold
the
people
is
one
and
they
have
all
one
language
and
this
they
begin
to
do
and
now
nothing
will
be
restrained
from
them
which
they
have
imagined
to
do
go
to
let
us
go
down
and
there
confound
their
language
that
they
may
not
understand
one
another
speech
so
the
lord
scattered
them
abroad
from
thence
upon
the
face
of
all
the
earth
and
they
left
off
to
build
the
city
therefore
is
the
name
of
it
called
babel
because
the
lord
did
there
confound
the
language
of
all
the
earth
and
from
thence
did
the
lord
scatter
them
abroad
upon
the
face
of
all
the
earth
genesis
xi
thus
far
the
legend
had
been
but
slightly
changed
from
the
earlier
chaldean
form
in
which
it
has
been
found
in
the
assyrian
inscriptions
its
character
is
very
simple
to
use
the
words
of
sayce
it
takes
us
back
to
the
age
when
the
gods
were
believed
to
dwell
in
the
visible
sky
and
when
man
therefore
did
his
best
to
rear
his
altars
as
near
them
as
possible
and
this
eminent
divine
might
have
added
that
it
takes
us
back
also
to
a
time
when
it
was
thought
that
jehovah
in
order
to
see
the
tower
fully
was
obliged
to
come
down
from
his
seat
above
the
firmament
as
to
the
real
reasons
for
the
building
of
the
towers
which
formed
so
striking
a
feature
in
chaldean
architecture
any
one
of
which
may
easily
have
given
rise
to
the
explanatory
myth
which
found
its
way
into
our
sacred
books
there
seems
a
substantial
agreement
among
leading
scholars
that
they
were
erected
primarily
as
parts
of
temples
but
largely
for
the
purpose
of
astronomical
observations
to
which
the
chaldeans
were
so
devoted
and
to
which
their
country
with
its
level
surface
and
clear
atmosphere
was
so
well
adapted
as
to
the
real
cause
of
the
ruin
of
such
structures
one
of
the
inscribed
cylinders
discovered
in
recent
times
speaking
of
a
tower
which
most
of
the
archaeologists
identify
with
the
tower
of
babel
reads
as
follows
the
building
named
the
stages
of
the
seven
spheres
which
was
the
tower
of
borsippa
had
been
built
by
a
former
king
he
had
completed
cubits
but
he
did
not
finish
its
head
during
the
lapse
of
time
it
had
become
ruined
they
had
not
taken
care
of
the
exit
of
the
waters
so
that
rain
and
wet
had
penetrated
into
the
brickwork
the
casing
of
burned
brick
had
swollen
out
and
the
terraces
of
crude
brick
are
scattered
in
heaps
we
can
well
understand
how
easily
the
gods
assisted
by
the
winds
as
stated
in
the
chaldean
legend
could
overthrow
a
tower
thus
built
it
may
be
instructive
to
compare
with
the
explanatory
myth
developed
first
by
the
chaldeans
and
in
a
slightly
different
form
by
the
hebrews
various
other
legends
to
explain
the
same
diversity
of
tongues
the
hindu
legend
of
the
confusion
of
tongues
is
as
follows
there
grew
in
the
centre
of
the
earth
the
wonderful
tree
or
tree
it
was
so
tall
that
it
reached
almost
to
heaven
it
said
in
its
heart
shall
hold
my
head
in
heaven
and
spread
my
branches
over
all
the
earth
and
gather
all
men
together
under
my
shadow
and
protect
them
and
prevent
them
from
separating
but
brahma
to
punish
the
pride
of
the
tree
cut
off
its
branches
and
cast
them
down
on
the
earth
when
they
sprang
up
as
wata
trees
and
made
differences
of
belief
and
speech
and
customs
to
prevail
on
the
earth
to
disperse
men
upon
its
surface
still
more
striking
is
a
mexican
legend
according
to
this
the
giant
xelhua
built
the
great
pyramid
of
cholula
in
order
to
reach
heaven
until
the
gods
angry
at
his
audacity
threw
fire
upon
the
building
and
broke
it
down
whereupon
every
separate
family
received
a
language
of
its
own
such
explanatory
myths
grew
or
spread
widely
over
the
earth
a
form
of
the
legend
more
like
the
chaldean
than
the
hebrew
later
form
appeared
among
the
greeks
according
to
this
the
aloidae
piled
mount
ossa
upon
olympus
and
pelion
upon
ossa
in
their
efforts
to
reach
heaven
and
dethrone
jupiter
still
another
form
of
it
entered
the
thoughts
of
plato
he
held
that
in
the
golden
age
men
and
beasts
all
spoke
the
same
language
but
that
zeus
confounded
their
speech
because
men
were
proud
and
demanded
eternal
youth
and
immortality

but
naturally
the
version
of
the
legend
which
most
affected
christendom
was
that
modification
of
the
chaldean
form
developed
among
the
jews
and
embodied
in
their
sacred
books
to
a
thinking
man
in
these
days
it
is
very
instructive
the
coming
down
of
the
almighty
from
heaven
to
see
the
tower
and
put
an
end
to
it
by
dispersing
its
builders
points
to
the
time
when
his
dwelling
was
supposed
to
be
just
above
the
firmament
or
solid
vault
above
the
earth
the
time
when
he
exercised
his
beneficent
activity
in
such
acts
as
opening
the
windows
of
heaven
to
give
down
rain
upon
the
earth
in
bringing
out
the
sun
every
day
and
hanging
up
the
stars
every
night
to
give
light
to
the
earth
in
hurling
comets
to
give
warning
in
placing
his
bow
in
the
cloud
to
give
hope
in
coming
down
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
to
walk
and
talk
with
the
man
he
had
made
in
making
coats
of
skins
for
adam
and
eve
in
enjoying
the
odour
of
flesh
which
noah
burned
for
him
in
eating
with
abraham
under
the
oaks
of
mamre
in
wrestling
with
jacob
and
in
writing
with
his
own
finger
on
the
stone
tables
for
moses
so
came
the
answer
to
the
third
question
regarding
language
and
all
three
answers
embodied
in
our
sacred
books
and
implanted
in
the
jewish
mind
supplied
to
the
christian
church
the
germs
of
a
theological
development
of
philology
these
germs
developed
rapidly
in
the
warm
atmosphere
of
devotion
and
ignorance
of
natural
law
which
pervaded
the
early
church
and
there
grew
a
great
orthodox
theory
of
language
which
was
held
throughout
christendom
always
everywhere
and
by
all
for
nearly
two
thousand
years
and
to
which
until
the
present
century
all
science
has
been
obliged
under
pains
and
penalties
to
conform
there
did
indeed
come
into
human
thought
at
an
early
period
some
suggestions
of
the
modern
scientific
view
of
philology
lucretius
had
proposed
a
theory
inadequate
indeed
but
still
pointing
toward
the
truth
as
follows
nature
impelled
man
to
try
the
various
sounds
of
the
tongue
and
so
struck
out
the
names
of
things
much
in
the
same
way
as
the
inability
to
speak
is
seen
in
its
turn
to
drive
children
to
the
use
of
gestures
but
among
the
early
fathers
of
the
church
the
only
one
who
seems
to
have
caught
an
echo
of
this
utterance
was
gregory
of
nyssa
as
a
rule
all
the
other
great
founders
of
christian
theology
as
far
as
they
expressed
themselves
on
the
subject
took
the
view
that
the
original
language
spoken
by
the
almighty
and
given
by
him
to
men
was
hebrew
and
that
from
this
all
other
languages
were
derived
at
the
destruction
of
the
tower
of
babel
this
doctrine
was
especially
upheld
by
origen
jerome
and
augustine
origen
taught
that
the
language
given
at
the
first
through
adam
the
hebrew
remained
among
that
portion
of
mankind
which
was
assigned
not
to
any
angel
but
continued
the
portion
of
god
himself
augustine
declared
that
when
the
other
races
were
divided
by
their
own
peculiar
languages
family
preserved
that
language
which
is
not
unreasonably
believed
to
have
been
the
common
language
of
the
race
and
that
on
this
account
it
was
henceforth
called
hebrew
jerome
wrote
the
whole
of
antiquity
affirms
that
hebrew
in
which
the
old
testament
is
written
was
the
beginning
of
all
human
speech
amid
such
great
authorities
as
these
even
gregory
of
nyssa
struggled
in
vain
he
seems
to
have
taken
the
matter
very
earnestly
and
to
have
used
not
only
argument
but
ridicule
he
insists
that
god
does
not
speak
hebrew
and
that
the
tongue
used
by
moses
was
not
even
a
pure
dialect
of
one
of
the
languages
resulting
from
the
confusion
he
makes
man
the
inventor
of
speech
and
resorts
to
raillery
speaking
against
his
opponent
eunomius
he
says
that
passing
in
silence
his
base
and
abject
garrulity
he
will
note
a
few
things
which
are
thrown
into
the
midst
of
his
useless
or
wordy
discourse
where
he
represents
god
teaching
words
and
names
to
our
first
parents
sitting
before
them
like
some
pedagogue
or
grammar
master
but
naturally
the
great
authority
of
origen
jerome
and
augustine
prevailed
the
view
suggested
by
lucretius
and
again
by
gregory
of
nyssa
died
out
and
always
everywhere
and
by
all
in
the
church
the
doctrine
was
received
that
the
language
spoken
by
the
almighty
was
hebrew
that
it
was
taught
by
him
to
adam
and
that
all
other
languages
on
the
face
of
the
earth
originated
from
it

the
dispersion

but
especially
for
a
most
candid
though
somewhat
reluctant
summing
up
see
this
idea
threw
out
roots
and
branches
in
every
direction
and
so
developed
ever
into
new
and
strong
forms
as
all
scholars
now
know
the
vowel
points
in
the
hebrew
language
were
not
adopted
until
at
some
period
between
the
second
and
tenth
centuries
but
in
the
mediaeval
church
they
soon
came
to
be
considered
as
part
of
the
great
miracle
as
the
work
of
the
right
hand
of
the
almighty
and
never
until
the
eighteenth
century
was
there
any
doubt
allowed
as
to
the
divine
origin
of
these
rabbinical
additions
to
the
text
to
hesitate
in
believing
that
these
points
were
dotted
virtually
by
the
very
hand
of
god
himself
came
to
be
considered
a
fearful
heresy
the
series
of
battles
between
theology
and
science
in
the
field
of
comparative
philology
opened
just
on
this
point
apparently
so
insignificant
the
direct
divine
inspiration
of
the
rabbinical
punctuation
the
first
to
impugn
this
divine
origin
of
these
vocal
points
and
accents
appears
to
have
been
a
spanish
monk
raymundus
martinus
in
his
pugio
fidei
or
poniard
of
the
faith
which
he
put
forth
in
the
thirteenth
century
but
he
and
his
doctrine
disappeared
beneath
the
waves
of
the
orthodox
ocean
and
apparently
left
no
trace
for
nearly
three
hundred
years
longer
the
full
sacred
theory
held
its
ground
but
about
the
opening
of
the
sixteenth
century
another
glimpse
of
the
truth
was
given
by
a
jew
elias
levita
and
this
seems
to
have
had
some
little
effect
at
least
in
keeping
the
germ
of
scientific
truth
alive
the
reformation
with
its
renewal
of
the
literal
study
of
the
scriptures
and
its
transfer
of
all
infallibility
from
the
church
and
the
papacy
to
the
letter
of
the
sacred
books
intensified
for
a
time
the
devotion
of
christendom
to
this
sacred
theory
of
language
the
belief
was
strongly
held
that
the
writers
of
the
bible
were
merely
pens
in
the
hand
of
god
dei
hence
the
conclusion
that
not
only
the
sense
but
the
words
letters
and
even
the
punctuation
proceeded
from
the
holy
spirit
only
on
this
one
question
of
the
origin
of
the
hebrew
points
was
there
any
controversy
and
this
waxed
hot
it
began
to
be
especially
noted
that
these
vowel
points
in
the
hebrew
bible
did
not
exist
in
the
synagogue
rolls
were
not
mentioned
in
the
talmud
and
seemed
unknown
to
jerome
and
on
these
grounds
some
earnest
men
ventured
to
think
them
no
part
of
the
original
revelation
to
adam
zwingli
so
much
before
most
of
the
reformers
in
other
respects
was
equally
so
in
this
while
not
doubting
the
divine
origin
and
preservation
of
the
hebrew
language
as
a
whole
he
denied
the
antiquity
of
the
vocal
points
demonstrated
their
unessential
character
and
pointed
out
the
fact
that
jerome
makes
no
mention
of
them
his
denial
was
long
the
refuge
of
those
who
shared
this
heresy
but
the
full
orthodox
theory
remained
established
among
the
vast
majority
both
of
catholics
and
protestants
the
attitude
of
the
former
is
well
illustrated
in
the
imposing
work
of
the
canon
marini
which
appeared
at
venice
in
under
the
title
of
noah
ark
a
new
treasury
of
the
sacred
tongue
the
huge
folios
begin
with
the
declaration
that
the
hebrew
tongue
was
divinely
inspired
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
world
and
the
doctrine
is
steadily
maintained
that
this
divine
inspiration
extended
not
only
to
the
letters
but
to
the
punctuation
not
before
the
seventeenth
century
was
well
under
way
do
we
find
a
thorough
scholar
bold
enough
to
gainsay
this
preposterous
doctrine
this
new
assailant
was
capellus
professor
of
hebrew
at
saumur
but
he
dared
not
put
forth
his
argument
in
france
he
was
obliged
to
publish
it
in
holland
and
even
there
such
obstacles
were
thrown
in
his
way
that
it
was
ten
years
before
he
published
another
treatise
of
importance
the
work
of
capellus
was
received
as
settling
the
question
by
very
many
scholars
among
whom
was
hugo
grotius
but
many
theologians
felt
this
view
to
be
a
blow
at
the
sanctity
and
integrity
of
the
sacred
text
and
in
the
great
scholar
john
buxtorf
the
younger
rose
to
defend
the
orthodox
citadel
in
his
anticritica
he
brought
all
his
stores
of
knowledge
to
uphold
the
doctrine
that
the
rabbinical
points
and
accents
had
been
jotted
down
by
the
right
hand
of
god
the
controversy
waxed
hot
scholars
like
voss
and
brian
walton
supported
capellus
wasmuth
and
many
others
of
note
were
as
fierce
against
him
the
swiss
protestants
were
especially
violent
on
the
orthodox
side
their
formula
consensus
of
declared
the
vowel
points
to
be
inspired
and
three
years
later
the
calvinists
of
geneva
by
a
special
canon
forbade
that
any
minister
should
be
received
into
their
jurisdiction
until
he
publicly
confessed
that
the
hebrew
text
as
it
exists
in
the
masoretic
copies
is
both
as
to
the
consonants
and
vowel
points
divine
and
authentic
while
in
holland
so
great
a
man
as
hugo
grotius
supported
the
view
of
capellus
and
while
in
france
the
eminent
catholic
scholar
richard
simon
and
many
others
catholic
and
protestant
took
similar
ground
against
this
divine
origin
of
the
hebrew
punctuation
there
was
arrayed
against
them
a
body
apparently
overwhelming
in
france
bossuet
the
greatest
theologian
that
france
has
ever
produced
did
his
best
to
crush
simon
in
germany
wasmuth
professor
first
at
rostock
and
afterward
at
kiel
hurled
his
vindiciae
at
the
innovators
yet
at
this
very
moment
the
battle
was
clearly
won
the
arguments
of
capellus
were
irrefragable
and
despite
the
commands
of
bishops
the
outcries
of
theologians
and
the
sneering
of
critics
his
application
of
strictly
scientific
observation
and
reasoning
carried
the
day
yet
a
casual
observer
long
after
the
fate
of
the
battle
was
really
settled
might
have
supposed
that
it
was
still
in
doubt
as
is
not
unusual
in
theologic
controversies
attempts
were
made
to
galvanize
the
dead
doctrine
into
an
appearance
of
life
famous
among
these
attempts
was
that
made
as
late
as
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
by
two
bremen
theologians
hase
and
iken
they
put
forth
a
compilation
in
two
huge
folios
simultaneously
at
leyden
and
amsterdam
prominent
in
which
work
is
the
treatise
on
the
integrity
of
scripture
by
johann
andreas
danzius
professor
of
oriental
languages
and
senior
member
of
the
philosophical
faculty
of
jena
and
to
preface
it
there
was
a
formal
and
fulsome
approval
by
three
eminent
professors
of
theology
at
leyden
with
great
fervour
the
author
pointed
out
that
religion
itself
depends
absolutely
on
the
infallible
inspiration
both
verbal
and
literal
of
the
scripture
text
and
with
impassioned
eloquence
he
assailed
the
blasphemers
who
dared
question
the
divine
origin
of
the
hebrew
points
but
this
was
really
the
last
great
effort
that
the
case
was
lost
was
seen
by
the
fact
that
danzius
felt
obliged
to
use
other
missiles
than
arguments
and
especially
to
call
his
opponents
hard
names
from
this
period
the
old
sacred
theory
as
to
the
origin
of
the
hebrew
points
may
be
considered
as
dead
and
buried
ii
the
sacred
theory
of
language
in
its
second
form
but
the
war
was
soon
to
be
waged
on
a
wider
and
far
more
important
field
the
inspiration
of
the
hebrew
punctuation
having
been
given
up
the
great
orthodox
body
fell
back
upon
the
remainder
of
the
theory
and
intrenched
this
more
strongly
than
ever
the
theory
that
the
hebrew
language
was
the
first
of
all
languages
that
which
was
spoken
by
the
almighty
given
by
him
to
adam
transmitted
through
noah
to
the
world
after
the
deluge
and
that
the
confusion
of
tongues
was
the
origin
of
all
other
languages
in
giving
account
of
this
new
phase
of
the
struggle
it
is
well
to
go
back
a
little
from
the
revival
of
learning
and
the
reformation
had
come
the
renewed
study
of
hebrew
in
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
and
thus
the
sacred
doctrine
regarding
the
origin
of
the
hebrew
language
received
additional
authority
all
the
early
hebrew
grammars
from
that
of
reuchlin
down
assert
the
divine
origin
and
miraculous
claims
of
hebrew
it
is
constantly
mentioned
as
the
sacred
tongue
sancta
lingua
in
reuchlin
though
himself
persecuted
by
a
large
faction
in
the
church
for
advanced
views
refers
to
hebrew
as
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
god
this
idea
was
popularized
by
the
edition
of
the
margarita
philosophica
published
at
strasburg
in
that
work
in
its
successive
editions
a
mirror
of
human
knowledge
at
the
close
of
the
middle
ages
and
the
opening
of
modern
times
contains
a
curious
introduction
to
the
study
of
hebrew
in
this
it
is
declared
that
hebrew
was
the
original
speech
used
between
god
and
man
and
between
men
and
angels
its
frontispiece
represents
moses
receiving
from
god
the
tables
of
stone
written
in
hebrew
and
as
a
conclusive
argument
it
reminds
us
that
christ
himself
by
choosing
a
hebrew
maid
for
his
mother
made
that
his
mother
tongue
it
must
be
noted
here
however

of
those
outbursts
of
strong
sense

often

his
career
enforced
the
explanation
that
the
words
god
said
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
articulation
of
human
language
still
he
evidently
yielded
to
the
general
view
in
the
roman
church
at
the
same
period
we
have
a
typical
example
of
the
theologic
method
applied
to
philology
as
we
have
seen
it
applied
to
other
sciences
in
the
statement
by
luther
great
opponent
cajetan
that
the
three
languages
of
the
inscription
on
the
cross
of
calvary
were
the
representatives
of
all
languages
because
the
number
three
denotes
perfection
in
postillus
made
a
very
important
endeavour
at
a
comparative
study
of
languages
but
with
the
orthodox
assumption
that
all
were
derived
from
one
source
namely
the
hebrew
naturally
comparative
philology
blundered
and
stumbled
along
this
path
into
endless
absurdities
the
most
amazing
efforts
were
made
to
trace
back
everything
to
the
sacred
language
english
and
latin
dictionaries
appeared
in
which
every
word
was
traced
back
to
a
hebrew
root
no
supposition
was
too
absurd
in
this
attempt
to
square
science
with
scripture
it
was
declared
that
as
hebrew
is
written
from
right
to
left
it
might
be
read
either
way
in
order
to
produce
a
satisfactory
etymology
the
whole
effort
in
all
this
sacred
scholarship
was
not
to
find
what
the
truth
is
not
to
see
how
the
various
languages
are
to
be
classified
or
from
what
source
they
are
really
derived
but
to
demonstrate
what
was
supposed
necessary
to
maintain
what
was
then
held
to
be
the
truth
of
scripture
namely
that
all
languages
are
derived
from
the
hebrew
this
stumbling
and
blundering
under
the
sway
of
orthodox
necessity
was
seen
among
the
foremost
scholars
throughout
europe
about
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
great
swiss
scholar
conrad
gesner
beginning
his
mithridates
says
while
of
all
languages
hebrew
is
the
first
and
oldest
of
all
is
alone
pure
and
unmixed
all
the
rest
are
much
mixed
for
there
is
none
which
has
not
some
words
derived
and
corrupted
from
hebrew
typical
as
we
approach
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
are
the
utterances
of
two
of
the
most
noted
english
divines
first
of
these
may
be
mentioned
william
fulke
master
of
pembroke
hall
in
the
university
of
cambridge
in
his
discovery
of
the
dangerous
rock
of
the
romish
church
published
in
he
speaks
of
the
hebrew
tongue
the
first
tongue
of
the
world
and
for
the
excellency
thereof
called
holy
tongue
yet
more
emphatic
eight
years
later
was
another
eminent
divine
william
whitaker
regius
professor
of
divinity
and
master
of
college
at
cambridge
in
his
disputation
on
holy
scripture
first
printed
in
he
says
the
hebrew
is
the
most
ancient
of
all
languages
and
was
that
which
alone
prevailed
in
the
world
before
the
deluge
and
the
erection
of
the
tower
of
babel
for
it
was
this
which
adam
used
and
all
men
before
the
flood
as
is
manifest
from
the
scriptures
as
the
fathers
testify
he
then
proceeds
to
quote
passages
on
this
subject
from
jerome
augustine
and
others
and
cites
chrysostom
in
support
of
the
statement
that
god
himself
showed
the
model
and
method
of
writing
when
he
delivered
the
law
written
by
his
own
finger
to
moses
for
the
whole
scriptural
argument
embracing
the
various
texts
on
which
the
sacred
science
of
philology
was
founded

that

in
stephen
guichard
built
new
buttresses
for
it
in
catholic
france
he
explains
in
his
preface
that
his
intention
is
to
make
the
reader
see
in
the
hebrew
word
not
only
the
greek
and
latin
but
also
the
italian
the
spanish
the
french
the
german
the
flemish
the
english
and
many
others
from
all
languages
as
the
merest
tyro
in
philology
can
now
see
the
great
difficulty
that
guichard
encounters
is
in
getting
from
the
hebrew
to
the
aryan
group
of
languages
how
he
meets
this
difficulty
may
be
imagined
from
his
statement
as
follows
as
for
the
derivation
of
words
by
addition
subtraction
and
inversion
of
the
letters
it
is
certain
that
this
can
and
ought
thus
to
be
done
if
we
would
find
etymologies
a
thing
which
becomes
very
credible
when
we
consider
that
the
hebrews
wrote
from
right
to
left
and
the
greeks
and
others
from
left
to
right
all
the
learned
recognise
such
derivations
as
necessary
and
certainly
otherwise
one
could
scarcely
trace
any
etymology
back
to
hebrew
of
course
by
this
method
of
philological
juggling
anything
could
be
proved
which
the
author
thought
necessary
to
his
pious
purpose
two
years
later
andrew
willett
published
at
london
his
hexapla
or
sixfold
commentary
upon
genesis
in
this
he
insists
that
the
one
language
of
all
mankind
in
the
beginning
was
the
hebrew
tongue
preserved
still
in
heber
family
he
also
takes
pains
to
say
that
the
tower
of
babel
was
not
so
called
of
belus
as
some
have
imagined
but
of
confusion
for
so
the
hebrew
word
ballal
signifieth
and
he
quotes
from
chrysostom
to
strengthen
his
position
in
constantine
was
inducted
into
the
chair
of
philosophy
of
the
sacred
language
in
the
university
of
leyden
in
his
inaugural
oration
on
the
dignity
and
utility
of
the
hebrew
tongue
he
puts
himself
on
record
in
favour
of
the
divine
origin
and
miraculous
purity
of
that
language
who
he
says
can
call
in
question
the
fact
that
the
hebrew
idiom
is
coeval
with
the
world
itself
save
such
as
seek
to
win
vainglory
for
their
own
sophistry
two
years
after
willett
in
england
comes
the
famous
lightfoot
the
most
renowned
scholar
of
his
time
in
hebrew
greek
and
latin
but
all
his
scholarship
was
bent
to
suit
theological
requirements
in
his
erubhin
published
in
he
goes
to
the
full
length
of
the
sacred
theory
though
we
begin
to
see
a
curious
endeavour
to
get
over
some
linguistic
difficulties
one
passage
will
serve
to
show
both
the
robustness
of
his
faith
and
the
acuteness
of
his
reasoning
in
view
of
the
difficulties
which
scholars
now
began
to
find
in
the
sacred
theory
other
commendations
this
tongue
hebrew
needeth
none
than
what
it
hath
of
itself
namely
for
sanctity
it
was
the
tongue
of
god
and
for
antiquity
it
was
the
tongue
of
adam
god
the
first
founder
and
adam
the
first
speaker
of
it
it
began
with
the
world
and
the
church
and
continued
and
increased
in
glory
till
the
captivity
in
babylon
as
the
man
in
seneca
that
through
sickness
lost
his
memory
and
forgot
his
own
name
so
the
jews
for
their
sins
lost
their
language
and
forgot
their
own
tongue
before
the
confusion
of
tongues
all
the
world
spoke
their
tongue
and
no
other
but
since
the
confusion
of
the
jews
they
speak
the
language
of
all
the
world
and
not
their
own
but
just
at
the
middle
of
the
century
came
in
england
a
champion
of
the
sacred
theory
more
important
than
any
of
these
brian
walton
bishop
of
chester
his
polyglot
bible
dominated
english
scriptural
criticism
throughout
the
remainder
of
the
century
he
prefaces
his
great
work
by
proving
at
length
the
divine
origin
of
hebrew
and
the
derivation
from
it
of
all
other
forms
of
speech
he
declares
it
probable
that
the
first
parent
of
mankind
was
the
inventor
of
letters
his
chapters
on
this
subject
are
full
of
interesting
details
he
says
that
the
welshman
davis
had
already
tried
to
prove
the
welsh
the
primitive
speech
wormius
the
danish
mitilerius
the
german
but
the
bishop
stands
firmly
by
the
sacred
theory
informing
us
that
even
in
the
new
world
are
found
traces
of
the
hebrew
tongue
namely
in
new
england
and
in
new
belgium
where
the
word
aguarda
signifies
earth
and
the
name
joseph
is
found
among
the
hurons
as
we
have
seen
bishop
walton
had
been
forced
to
give
up
the
inspiration
of
the
rabbinical
punctuation
but
he
seems
to
have
fallen
back
with
all
the
more
tenacity
on
what
remained
of
the
great
sacred
theory
of
language
and
to
have
become
its
leading
champion
among
peoples
at
that
same
period
the
same
doctrine
was
put
forth
by
a
great
authority
in
germany
in
andreas
sennert
published
his
inaugural
address
as
professor
of
sacred
letters
and
dean
of
the
theological
faculty
at
wittenberg
all
his
efforts
were
given
to
making
luther
old
university
a
fortress
of
the
orthodox
theory
his
address
like
many
others
in
various
parts
of
europe
shows
that
in
his
time
an
inaugural
with
any
save
an
orthodox
statement
of
the
theological
platform
would
not
be
tolerated
few
things
in
the
past
are
to
the
sentimental
mind
more
pathetic
to
the
philosophical
mind
more
natural
and
to
the
progressive
mind
more
ludicrous
than
addresses
at
high
festivals
of
theological
schools
the
audience
has
generally
consisted
mainly
of
estimable
elderly
gentlemen
who
received
their
theology
in
their
youth
and
who
in
their
old
age
have
watched
over
it
with
jealous
care
to
keep
it
well
protected
from
every
fresh
breeze
of
thought
naturally
a
theological
professor
inaugurated
under
such
auspices
endeavours
to
propitiate
his
audience
sennert
goes
to
great
lengths
both
in
his
address
and
in
his
grammar
published
nine
years
later
for
declaring
the
divine
origin
of
hebrew
to
be
quite
beyond
controversy
he
says
noah
received
it
from
our
first
parents
and
guarded
it
in
the
midst
of
the
waters
heber
and
peleg
saved
it
from
the
confusion
of
tongues
the
same
doctrine
was
no
less
loudly
insisted
upon
by
the
greatest
authority
in
switzerland
buxtorf
professor
at
basle
who
proclaimed
hebrew
to
be
the
tongue
of
god
the
tongue
of
angels
the
tongue
of
the
prophets
and
the
effect
of
this
proclamation
may
be
imagined
when
we
note
in
that
his
book
had
reached
its
sixth
edition
it
was
through
england
germany
france
and
america
and
if
possible
yet
more
highly
developed
in
england
theophilus
gale
set
himself
to
prove
that
not
only
all
the
languages
but
all
the
learning
of
the
world
had
been
drawn
from
the
hebrew
records
this
orthodox
doctrine
was
also
fully
vindicated
in
holland
six
years
before
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century
morinus
doctor
of
theology
professor
of
oriental
languages
and
pastor
at
amsterdam
published
his
great
work
on
primaeval
language
its
frontispiece
depicts
the
confusion
of
tongues
at
babel
and
as
a
pendant
to
this
the
pentecostal
gift
of
tongues
to
the
apostles
in
the
successive
chapters
of
the
first
book
he
proves
that
language
could
not
have
come
into
existence
save
as
a
direct
gift
from
heaven
that
there
is
a
primitive
language
the
mother
of
all
the
rest
that
this
primitive
language
still
exists
in
its
pristine
purity
that
this
language
is
the
hebrew
the
second
book
is
devoted
to
proving
that
the
hebrew
letters
were
divinely
received
have
been
preserved
intact
and
are
the
source
of
all
other
alphabets
but
in
the
third
book
he
feels
obliged
to
allow
in
the
face
of
the
contrary
dogma
held
as
he
says
by
not
a
few
most
eminent
men
piously
solicitous
for
the
authority
of
the
sacred
text
that
the
hebrew
punctuation
was
after
all
not
of
divine
inspiration
but
a
late
invention
of
the
rabbis
france
also
was
held
to
all
appearance
in
complete
subjection
to
the
orthodox
idea
up
to
the
end
of
the
century
in
appeared
at
paris
perhaps
the
most
learned
of
all
the
books
written
to
prove
hebrew
the
original
tongue
and
source
of
all
others
the
gallican
church
was
then
at
the
height
of
its
power
bossuet
as
bishop
as
thinker

as
adviser
of
louis
xiv

crushed
all
opposition
to
orthodoxy
the
edict
of
nantes
had
been
revoked
and
the
huguenots
so
far
as
they
could
escape
were
scattered
throughout
the
world
destined
to
repay
france
with
interest
a
thousandfold
during
the
next
two
centuries
the
bones
of
the
jansenists
at
port
royal
were
dug
up
and
scattered
louis
xiv
stood
guard
over
the
piety
of
his
people
it
was
in
the
midst
of
this
series
of
triumphs
that
father
louis
thomassin
priest
of
the
oratory
issued
his
universal
hebrew
glossary
in
this

use
his
own
language
the

perpetuity
of
the
hebrew
tongue
with
its
letters

and
other
characters
are
established
forever
and
beyond
all
cavil
by
proofs
drawn
from
all
peoples
kindreds
and
nations
under
the
sun
this
superb
folio
was
issued
from
the
royal
press
and
is
one
of
the
most
imposing
monuments
of
human
piety
and
folly

steadily
maintained
and
as
in
a
responsive
chant
its
doctrines
were
echoed
from
land
to
land
from
america
there
came
the
earnest
words
of
john
eliot
praising
hebrew
as
the
most
fit
to
be
made
a
universal
language
and
declaring
it
the
tongue
which
it
pleased
our
lord
jesus
to
make
use
of
when
he
spake
from
heaven
unto
paul
at
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century
came
from
england
a
strong
antiphonal
answer
in
this
chorus
meric
casaubon
the
learned
prebendary
of
canterbury
thus
declared
one
language
the
hebrew
i
hold
to
be
simply
and
absolutely
the
source
of
all
and
to
swell
the
chorus
there
came
into
it
in
complete
unison
the
voice
of
bentley
the
greatest
scholar
of
the
old
sort
whom
england
has
ever
produced
he
was
indeed
one
of
the
most
learned
and
acute
critics
of
any
age
but
he
was
also
master
of
trinity
archdeacon
of
bristol
held
two
livings
besides
and
enjoyed
the
honour
of
refusing
the
bishopric
of
bristol
as
not
rich
enough
to
tempt
him
noblesse
oblige
that
bentley
should
hold
a
brief
for
the
theological
side
was
inevitable
and
we
need
not
be
surprised
when
we
hear
him
declaring
we
are
sure
from
the
names
of
persons
and
places
mentioned
in
scripture
before
the
deluge
not
to
insist
upon
other
arguments
that
the
hebrew
was
the
primitive
language
of
mankind
and
that
it
continued
pure
above
three
thousand
years
until
the
captivity
in
babylon
the
power
of
the
theologic
bias
when
properly
stimulated
with
ecclesiastical
preferment
could
hardly
be
more
perfectly
exemplified
than
in
such
a
captivity
of
such
a
man
as
bentley
yet
here
two
important
exceptions
should
be
noted
in
england
prideaux
whose
biblical
studies
gave
him
much
authority
opposed
the
dominant
opinion
and
in
america
cotton
mather
who
in
taking
his
degree
at
harvard
had
supported
the
doctrine
that
the
hebrew
vowel
points
were
of
divine
origin
bravely
recanted

but
even
this
dissent
produced
little
immediate
effect
and
at
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
this
sacred
doctrine
based
upon
explicit
statements
of
scripture
seemed
forever
settled
as
we
have
seen
strong
fortresses
had
been
built
for
it
in
every
christian
land
nothing
seemed
more
unlikely
than
that
the
little
groups
of
scholars
scattered
through
these
various
countries
could
ever
prevail
against
them
these
strongholds
were
built
so
firmly
and
had
behind
them
so
vast
an
army
of
religionists
of
every
creed
that
to
conquer
them
seemed
impossible
and
yet
at
that
very
moment
their
doom
was
decreed
within
a
few
years
from
this
period
of
their
greatest
triumph
the
garrisons
of
all
these
sacred
fortresses
were
in
hopeless
confusion
and
the
armies
behind
them
in
full
retreat
a
little
later
all
the
important
orthodox
fortresses
and
forces
were
in
the
hands
of
the
scientific
philologists
how
this
came
about
will
be
shown
in
the
third
part
of
this
chapter
iii
breaking
down
of
the
theological
view
we
have
now
seen
the
steps
by
which
the
sacred
theory
of
human
language
had
been
developed
how
it
had
been
strengthened
in
every
land
until
it
seemed
to
bid
defiance
forever
to
advancing
thought
how
it
rested
firmly
upon
the
letter
of
scripture
upon
the
explicit
declarations
of
leading
fathers
of
the
church
of
the
great
doctors
of
the
middle
ages
of
the
most
eminent
theological
scholars
down
to
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
was
guarded
by
the
decrees
of
popes
kings
bishops
catholic
and
protestant
and
the
whole
hierarchy
of
authorities
in
church
and
state
and
yet
as
we
now
look
back
it
is
easy
to
see
that
even
in
that
hour
of
its
triumph
it
was
doomed
the
reason
why
the
church
has
so
fully
accepted
the
conclusions
of
science
which
have
destroyed
the
sacred
theory
is
instructive
the
study
of
languages
has
been
since
the
revival
of
learning
and
the
reformation
a
favourite
study
with
the
whole
western
church
catholic
and
protestant
the
importance
of
understanding
the
ancient
tongues
in
which
our
sacred
books
are
preserved
first
stimulated
the
study
and
church
missionary
efforts
have
contributed
nobly
to
supply
the
material
for
extending
it
and
for
the
application
of
that
comparative
method
which
in
philology
as
in
other
sciences
has
been
so
fruitful
hence
it
is
that
so
many
leading
theologians
have
come
to
know
at
first
hand
the
truths
given
by
this
science
and
to
recognise
its
fundamental
principles
what
the
conclusions
which
they
as
well
as
all
other
scholars
in
this
field
have
been
absolutely
forced
to
accept
i
shall
now
endeavour
to
show
the
beginnings
of
a
scientific
theory
seemed
weak
indeed
but
they
were
none
the
less
effective
as
far
back
as
hottinger
professor
at
heidelberg
came
into
the
chorus
of
theologians
like
a
great
bell
in
a
chime
but
like
a
bell
whose
opening
tone
is
harmonious
and
whose
closing
tone
is
discordant
for
while
at
the
beginning
hottinger
cites
a
formidable
list
of
great
scholars
who
had
held
the
sacred
theory
of
the
origin
of
language
he
goes
on
to
note
a
closer
resemblance
to
the
hebrew
in
some
languages
than
in
others
and
explains
this
by
declaring
that
the
confusion
of
tongues
was
of
two
sorts
total
and
partial
the
arabic
and
chaldaic
he
thinks
underwent
only
a
partial
confusion
the
egyptian
persian
and
all
the
european
languages
a
total
one
here
comes
in
the
discord
here
gently
sounds
forth
from
the
great
chorus
a
new
note
that
idea
of
grouping
and
classifying
languages
which
at
a
later
day
was
to
destroy
utterly
the
whole
sacred
theory
but
the
great
chorus
resounded
on
as
we
have
seen
from
shore
to
shore
until
the
closing
years
of
the
seventeenth
century
then
arose
men
who
silenced
it
forever
the
first
leader
who
threw
the
weight
of
his
knowledge
thought
and
authority
against
it
was
leibnitz
he
declared
there
is
as
much
reason
for
supposing
hebrew
to
have
been
the
primitive
language
of
mankind
as
there
is
for
adopting
the
view
of
goropius
who
published
a
work
at
antwerp
in
to
prove
that
dutch
was
the
language
spoken
in
paradise
in
a
letter
to
tenzel
leibnitz
wrote
to
call
hebrew
the
primitive
language
is
like
calling
the
branches
of
a
tree
primitive
branches
or
like
imagining
that
in
some
country
hewn
trunks
could
grow
instead
of
trees
he
also
asked
if
the
primeval
language
existed
even
up
to
the
time
of
moses
whence
came
the
egyptian
language
but
the
efficiency
of
leibnitz
did
not
end
with
mere
suggestions
he
applied
the
inductive
method
to
linguistic
study
made
great
efforts
to
have
vocabularies
collected
and
grammars
drawn
up
wherever
missionaries
and
travellers
came
in
contact
with
new
races
and
thus
succeeded
in
giving
the
initial
impulse
to
at
least
three
notable
collections
that
of
catharine
the
great
of
russia
that
of
the
spanish
jesuit
lorenzo
hervas
and
at
a
later
period
the
mithridates
of
adelung
the
interest
of
the
empress
catharine
in
her
collection
of
linguistic
materials
was
very
strong
and
her
influence
is
seen
in
the
fact
that
washington
to
please
her
requested
governors
and
generals
to
send
in
materials
from
various
parts
of
the
united
states
and
the
territories
the
work
of
hervas
extended
over
the
period
from
to
a
missionary
in
america
he
enlarged
his
catalogue
of
languages
to
six
volumes
which
were
published
in
spanish
in
and
contained
specimens
of
more
than
three
hundred
languages
with
the
grammars
of
more
than
forty
it
should
be
said
to
his
credit
that
hervas
dared
point
out
with
especial
care
the
limits
of
the
semitic
family
of
languages
and
declared
as
a
result
of
his
enormous
studies
that
the
various
languages
of
mankind
could
not
have
been
derived
from
the
hebrew
while
such
work
was
done
in
catholic
spain
protestant
germany
was
honoured
by
the
work
of
adelung
it
contained
the
lord
prayer
in
nearly
five
hundred
languages
and
dialects
and
the
comparison
of
these
early
in
the
nineteenth
century
helped
to
end
the
sway
of
theological
philology
but
the
period
which
intervened
between
leibnitz
and
this
modern
development
was
a
period
of
philological
chaos
it
began
mainly
with
the
doubts
which
leibnitz
had
forced
upon
europe
and
ended
only
with
the
beginning
of
the
study
of
sanskrit
in
the
latter
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
with
the
comparisons
made
by
means
of
the
collections
of
catharine
hervas
and
adelung
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
the
old
theory
that
hebrew
was
the
original
language
had
gone
to
pieces
but
nothing
had
taken
its
place
as
a
finality
great
authorities
like
buddeus
were
still
cited
in
behalf
of
the
narrower
belief
but
everywhere
researches
unorganized
though
they
were
tended
to
destroy
it
the
story
of
babel
continued
indeed
throughout
the
whole
eighteenth
century
to
hinder
or
warp
scientific
investigation
and
a
very
curious
illustration
of
this
fact
is
seen
in
the
book
of
lord
nelme
on
the
origin
and
elements
of
language
he
declares
that
connected
with
the
confusion
was
the
cleaving
of
america
from
europe
and
he
regards
the
most
terrible
chapters
in
the
book
of
job
as
intended
for
a
description
of
the
flood
which
in
all
probability
job
had
from
noah
himself
again
rowland
jones
tried
to
prove
that
celtic
was
the
primitive
tongue
and
that
it
passed
through
babel
unharmed
still
another
effect
was
made
by
a
breton
to
prove
that
all
languages
took
their
rise
in
the
language
of
brittany
all
was
chaos
there
was
much
wrangling
but
little
earnest
controversy
here
and
there
theologians
were
calling
out
frantically
beseeching
the
church
to
save
the
old
doctrine
as
essential
to
the
truth
of
scripture
here
and
there
other
divines
began
to
foreshadow
the
inevitable
compromise
which
has
always
been
thus
vainly
attempted
in
the
history
of
every
science
but
it
was
soon
seen
by
thinking
men
that
no
concessions
as
yet
spoken
of
by
theologians
were
sufficient
in
the
latter
half
of
the
century
came
the
bloom
period
of
the
french
philosophers
and
encyclopedists
of
the
english
deists
of
such
german
thinkers
as
herder
kant
and
lessing
and
while
here
and
there
some
writer
on
the
theological
side
like
perrin
amused
thinking
men
by
his
flounderings

this
great

nothing
better
reveals
to
us
the
darkness
and
duration
of
this
chaos
in
england
than
a
comparison
of
the
articles
on
philology
given
in
the
successive
editions
of
the
encyclopaedia
britannica
the
first
edition
of
that
great
mirror
of
british
thought
was
printed
in
chaos
reigns
through
the
whole
of
its
article
on
this
subject
the
writer
divides
languages
into
two
classes
seems
to
indicate
a
mixture
of
divine
inspiration
with
human
invention
and
finally
escapes
under
a
cloud
in
the
second
edition
published
in
some
progress
has
been
made
the
author
states
the
sacred
theory
and
declares
there
are
some
divines
who
pretend
that
hebrew
was
the
language
in
which
god
talked
with
adam
in
paradise
and
that
the
saints
will
make
use
of
it
in
heaven
in
those
praises
which
they
will
eternally
offer
to
the
almighty
these
doctors
seem
to
be
as
certain
in
regard
to
what
is
past
as
to
what
is
to
come
this
was
evidently
considered
dangerous
it
clearly
outran
the
belief
of
the
average
british
philistine
and
accordingly
we
find
in
the
third
edition
published
seventeen
years
later
a
new
article
in
which
while
the
author
gives
as
he
says
the
best
arguments
on
both
sides
he
takes
pains
to
adhere
to
a
fairly
orthodox
theory
this
soothing
dose
was
repeated
in
the
fourth
and
fifth
editions
in
appeared
a
supplement
to
the
fourth
fifth
and
sixth
editions
which
dealt
with
the
facts
so
far
as
they
were
known
but
there
was
scarcely
a
reference
to
the
biblical
theory
throughout
the
article
three
years
later
came
another
supplement
while
this
chaos
was
fast
becoming
cosmos
in
germany
such
a
change
had
evidently
not
gone
far
in
england
for
from
this
edition
of
the
encyclopaedia
the
subject
of
philology
was
omitted
in
fact
babel
and
philology
made
nearly
as
much
trouble
to
encyclopedists
as
noah
deluge
and
geology
just
as
in
the
latter
case
they
had
been
obliged
to
stave
off
a
presentation
of
scientific
truth
by
the
words
for
deluge
see
flood
and
for
flood
see
noah
so
in
the
former
they
were
obliged
to
take
various
provisional
measures
some
of
them
comical
in
came
the
seventh
edition
in
this
the
first
part
of
the
old
article
on
philology
which
had
appeared
in
the
third
fourth
and
fifth
editions
was
printed
but
the
supernatural
part
was
mainly
cut
out
yet
we
find
a
curious
evidence
of
the
continued
reign
of
chaos
in
a
inserted
by
the
publishers
disavowing
any
departure
from
orthodox

eighth

this
abandoned
the
old
article
completely
and
in
its
place
gave
a
history
of
philology
free
from

finally
in

appeared
the

in
which
professors
whitney
of

give
admirably
and

what

making
short
work
of

sacred

in
fact
throwing
it
overboard
entirely
iv
triumph
of
the
new
science
such
was
that
chaos
of
thought
into
which
the
discovery
of
sanskrit
suddenly
threw
its
great
light
well
does
one
of
the
foremost
modern
philologists
say
that
this
was
the
electric
spark
which
caused
the
floating
elements
to
crystallize
into
regular
forms
among
the
first
to
bring
the
knowledge
of
sanskrit
to
europe
were
the
jesuit
missionaries
whose
services
to
the
material
basis
of
the
science
of
comparative
philology
had
already
been
so
great
and
the
importance
of
the
new
discovery
was
soon
seen
among
all
scholars
whether
orthodox
or
scientific
in
the
asiatic
society
at
calcutta
was
founded
and
with
it
began
sanskrit
philology
scholars
like
sir
william
jones
carey
wilkins
foster
colebrooke
did
noble
work
in
the
new
field
a
new
spirit
brooded
over
that
chaos
and
a
great
new
orb
of
science
was
evolved
the
little
group
of
scholars
who
gave
themselves
up
to
these
researches
though
almost
without
exception
reverent
christians
were
recognised
at
once
by
theologians
as
mortal
foes
of
the
whole
sacred
theory
of
language
not
only
was
the
dogma
of
the
multiplication
of
languages
at
the
tower
of
babel
swept
out
of
sight
by
the
new
discovery
but
the
still
more
vital
dogma
of
the
divine
origin
of
language
never
before
endangered
was
felt
to
be
in
peril
since
the
evidence
became
overwhelming
that
so
many
varieties
had
been
produced
by
a
process
of
natural
growth
heroic
efforts
were
therefore
made
in
the
supposed
interest
of
scripture
to
discredit
the
new
learning
even
such
a
man
as
dugald
stewart
declared
that
the
discovery
of
sanskrit
was
altogether
fraudulent
and
endeavoured
to
prove
that
the
brahmans
had
made
it
up
from
the
vocabulary
and
grammar
of
greek
and
latin
others
exercised
their
ingenuity
in
picking
the
new
discovery
to
pieces
and
still
others
attributed
it
all
to
the
machinations
of
satan
on
the
other
hand
the
more
thoughtful
men
in
the
church
endeavoured
to
save
something
from
the
wreck
of
the
old
system
by
a
compromise
they
attempted
to
prove
that
hebrew
is
at
least
a
cognate
tongue
with
the
original
speech
of
mankind
if
not
the
original
speech
itself
but
here
they
were
confronted
by
the
authority
they
dreaded
most
the
great
christian
scholar
sir
william
jones
himself
his
words
were
i
can
only
declare
my
belief
that
the
language
of
noah
is
irretrievably
lost
after
diligent
search
i
can
not
find
a
single
word
used
in
common
by
the
arabian
indian
and
tartar
families
before
the
intermixture
of
dialects
occasioned
by
the
mohammedan
conquests
so
too
in
germany
came
full
acknowledgment
of
the
new
truth
and
from
a
roman
catholic
frederick
schlegel
he
accepted
the
discoveries
in
the
old
language
and
literature
of
india
as
final
he
saw
the
significance
of
these
discoveries
as
regards
philology
and
grouped
the
languages
of
india
persia
greece
italy
and
germany
under
the
name
afterward
so
universally
accepted
it
now
began
to
be
felt
more
and
more
even
among
the
most
devoted
churchmen
that
the
old
theological
dogmas
regarding
the
origin
of
language
as
held
always
everywhere
and
by
all
were
wrong
and
that
lucretius
and
sturdy
old
gregory
of
nyssa
might
be
right
but
this
was
not
the
only
wreck
during
ages
the
great
men
in
the
church
had
been
calling
upon
the
world
to
admire
the
amazing
exploit
of
adam
in
naming
the
animals
which
jehovah
had
brought
before
him
and
to
accept
the
history
of
language
in
the
light
of
this
exploit
the
early
fathers
the
mediaeval
doctors
the
great
divines
of
the
reformation
period
catholic
and
protestant
had
united
in
this
universal
chorus
clement
of
alexandria
declared
adam
naming
of
the
animals
proof
of
a
prophetic
gift
john
chrysostom
insisted
that
it
was
an
evidence
of
consummate
intelligence
eusebius
held
that
the
phrase
that
was
the
name
thereof
implied
that
each
name
embodied
the
real
character
and
description
of
the
animal
concerned
this
view
was
echoed
by
a
multitude
of
divines
in
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
typical
among
these
was
the
great
south
who
in
his
sermon
on
the
state
of
man
before
the
fall
declared
that
adam
came
into
the
world
a
philosopher
which
sufficiently
appears
by
his
writing
the
nature
of
things
upon
their
names
in
the
chorus
of
modern
english
divines
there
appeared
one
of
eminence
who
declared
against
this
theory
shuckford
chaplain
in
ordinary
to
his
majesty
george
ii
in
the
preface
to
his
work
on
the
creation
and
fall
of
man
pronounced
the
whole
theory
romantic
and
irrational
he
goes
on
to
say
the
original
of
our
speaking
was
from
god
not
that
god
put
into
adam
mouth
the
very
sounds
which
he
designed
he
should
use
as
the
names
of
things
but
god
made
adam
with
the
powers
of
a
man
he
had
the
use
of
an
understanding
to
form
notions
in
his
mind
of
the
things
about
him
and
he
had
the
power
to
utter
sounds
which
should
be
to
himself
the
names
of
things
according
as
he
might
think
fit
to
call
them
this
echo
of
gregory
of
nyssa
was
for
many
years
of
little
avail
historians
of
philosophy
still
began
with
adam
because
only
a
philosopher
could
have
named
all
created
things
there
was
indeed
one
difficulty
which
had
much
troubled
some
theologians
this
was
that
fishes
were
not
specially
mentioned
among
the
animals
brought
by
jehovah
before
adam
for
naming
to
meet
this
difficulty
there
was
much
argument
and
some
theologians
laid
stress
on
the
difficulty
of
bringing
fishes
from
the
sea
to
the
garden
of
eden
to
receive
their
names
but
naturally
other
theologians
replied
that
the
almighty
power
which
created
the
fishes
could
have
easily
brought
them
into
the
garden
one
by
one
even
from
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
sea
this
point
therefore
seems
to
have
been
left
in
abeyance
for
the
danger
of
the
little

see

pp
it
had
continued
then
the
universal
belief
in
the
church
that
the
names
of
all
created
things
except
possibly
fishes
were
given
by
adam
and
in
hebrew
but
all
this
theory
was
whelmed
in
ruin
when
it
was
found
that
there
were
other
and
indeed
earlier
names
for
the
same
animals
than
those
in
the
hebrew
language
and
especially
was
this
enforced
on
thinking
men
when
the
egyptian
discoveries
began
to
reveal
the
pictures
of
animals
with
their
names
in
hieroglyphics
at
a
period
earlier
than
that
agreed
on
by
all
the
sacred
chronologists
as
the
date
of
the
creation
still
another
part
of
the
sacred
theory
now
received
its
closely
allied
with
the
question
of
the
origin
of
language
was
that
of
the
origin
of
letters
the
earlier
writers
had
held
that
letters
were
also
a
divine
gift
to
adam
but
as
we
go
on
in
the
eighteenth
century
we
find
theological
opinion
inclining
to
the
belief
that
this
gift
was
reserved
for
moses
this
as
we
have
seen
was
the
view
of
john
chrysostom
and
an
eminent
english
divine
early
in
the
eighteenth
century
john
johnson
vicar
of
kent
echoed
it
in
the
declaration
concerning
the
alphabet
that
moses
first
learned
it
from
god
by
means
of
the
lettering
on
the
tables
of
the
law
but
here
a
difficulty
arose
the
biblical
statement
that
god
commanded
moses
to
write
in
a
book
his
decree
concerning
amalek
before
he
went
up
into
sinai
with
this
the
good
vicar
grapples
manfully
he
supposes
that
god
had
previously
concealed
the
tables
of
stone
in
mount
horeb
and
that
moses
when
he
kept
jethro
sheep
thereabout
had
free
access
to
these
tables
and
perused
them
at
discretion
though
he
was
not
permitted
to
carry
them
down
with
him
our
reconciler
then
asks
for
what
other
reason
could
god
have
kept
moses
up
in
the
mountain
forty
days
at
a
time
except
to
teach
him
to
write
and
says
it
seems
highly
probable
that
the
angel
gave
him
the
alphabet
of
the
hebrew
or
in
some
other
way
unknown
to
us
became
his
guide
but
this
theory
of
letters
was
soon
to
be
doomed
like
the
other
parts
of
the
sacred
theory
studies
in
comparative
philology
based
upon
researches
in
india
began
to
be
reenforced
by
facts
regarding
the
inscriptions
in
egypt
the
cuneiform
inscriptions
of
assyria
the
legends
of
chaldea
and
the
folklore
of
china
where
it
was
found
in
the
sacred
books
that
the
animals
were
named
by
fohi
and
with
such
wisdom
and
insight
that
every
name
disclosed
the
nature
of
the
corresponding
animal
but
although
the
old
theory
was
doomed
heroic
efforts
were
still
made
to
support
it
in
james
beattie
in
all
the
glory
of
his
oxford
doctorate
and
royal
pension
made
a
vigorous
onslaught
declaring
the
new
system
of
philology
to
be
degrading
to
our
nature
and
that
the
theory
of
the
natural
development
of
language
is
simply
due
to
the
beauty
of
lucretius
poetry
but
his
main
weapon
was
ridicule
and
in
this
he
showed
himself
a
master
he
tells
the
world
the
following
paraphrase
has
nothing
of
the
elegance
of
horace
or
lucretius
but
seems
to
have
all
the
elegance
that
so
ridiculous
a
doctrine
deserves
when
men
out
of
the
earth
of
old
a
dumb
and
beastly
vermin
crawled
for
acorns
first
and
holes
of
shelter
they
tooth
and
nail
and
helter
skelter
fought
fist
to
fist
then
with
a
club
each
learned
his
brother
brute
to
drub
till
more
experienced
grown
these
cattle
forged
fit
accoutrements
for
battle
at
last
lucretius
says
and
creech
they
set
their
wits
to
work
on
speech
and
that
their
thoughts
might
all
have
marks
to
make
them
known
these
learned
clerks
left
off
the
trade
of
cracking
crowns
and
manufactured
verbs
and
nouns
but
a
far
more
powerful
theologian
entered
the
field
in
england
to
save
the
sacred
theory
of
language
adam
clarke
he
was
no
less
severe
against
philology
than
against
geology
in
as
president
of
the
manchester
philological
society
he
delivered
an
address
in
which
he
declared
that
while
men
of
all
sects
were
eligible
to
membership
he
who
rejects
the
establishment
of
what
we
believe
to
be
a
divine
revelation
he
who
would
disturb
the
peace
of
the
quiet
and
by
doubtful
disputations
unhinge
the
minds
of
the
simple
and
unreflecting
and
endeavour
to
turn
the
unwary
out
of
the
way
of
peace
and
rational
subordination
can
have
no
seat
among
the
members
of
this
institution
the
first
sentence
in
this
declaration
gives
food
for
reflection
for
it
is
the
same
confusion
of
two
ideas
which
has
been
at
the
root
of
so
much
interference
of
theology
with
science
for
the
last
two
thousand
years
adam
clarke
speaks
of
those
who
reject
the
establishment
of
what
we
believe
to
be
a
divine
revelation
thus
comes
in
that
customary
begging
of
the
question
the
substitution
as
the
real
significance
of
scripture
of
what
we
believe
for
what
is
the
intended
result
too
of
this
ecclesiastical
sentence
was
simple
enough
it
was
that
great
men
like
sir
william
jones
colebrooke
and
their
compeers
must
not
be
heard
in
the
manchester
philological
society
in
discussion
with
adam
clarke
on
questions
regarding
sanskrit
and
other
matters
regarding
which
they
knew
all
that
was
then
known
and
clarke
knew
nothing
but
even
clarke
was
forced
to
yield
to
the
scientific
current
thirty
years
later
in
his
commentary
on
the
old
testament
he
pitched
the
claims
of
the
sacred
theory
on
a
much
lower
key
he
says
mankind
was
of
one
language
in
all
likelihood
the
hebrew
the
proper
names
and
other
significations
given
in
the
scripture
seem
incontestable
evidence
that
the
hebrew
language
was
the
original
language
of
the
earth
the
language
in
which
god
spoke
to
man
and
in
which
he
gave
the
revelation
of
his
will
to
moses
and
the
prophets
here
are
signs
that
this
great
champion
is
growing
weaker
in
the
faith
in
the
citations
made
it
will
be
observed
he
no
longer
says
is
but
seems
and
finally
we
have
him
saying
what
the
first
language
was
is
almost
useless
to
inquire
as
it
is
impossible
to
arrive
at
any
satisfactory
information
on
this
point
in
france
during
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
yet
more
heavy
artillery
was
wheeled
into
place
in
order
to
make
a
last
desperate
defence
of
the
sacred
theory
the
leaders
in
this
effort
were
the
three
great
ultramontanes
de
maistre
de
bonald
and
lamennais
condillac
contention
that
languages
were
gradually
and
insensibly
acquired
and
that
every
man
had
his
share
of
the
general
result
they
attacked
with
reasoning
based
upon
premises
drawn
from
the
book
of
genesis
de
maistre
especially
excelled
in
ridiculing
the
philosophic
or
scientific
theory
lamennais
who
afterward
became
so
vexatious
a
thorn
in
the
side
of
the
church
insisted
at
this
earlier
period
that
man
can
no
more
think
without
words
than
see
without
light
and
then
by
that
sort
of
mystical
play
upon
words
so
well
known
in
the
higher
ranges
of
theologic
reasoning
he
clinches
his
argument
by
saying
the
word
is
truly
and
in
every
sense
light
which
lighteth
every
man
that
cometh
into
the
world
but
even
such
champions
as
these
could
not
stay
the
progress
of
thought
while
they
seemed
to
be
carrying
everything
before
them
in
france
researches
in
philology
made
at
such
centres
of
thought
as
the
sorbonne
and
the
college
of
france
were
undermining
their
last
great
fortress
curious
indeed
is
it
to
find
that
the
sorbonne
the
stronghold
of
theology
through
so
many
centuries
was
now
made
in
the
nineteenth
century
the
arsenal
and
stronghold
of
the
new
ideas
but
the
most
striking
result
of
the
new
tendency
in
france
was
seen
when
the
greatest
of
the
three
champions
lamennais
himself
though
offered
the
highest
church
preferment
and
even
a
cardinal
hat
braved
the
papal
anathema

science
took
so
strong
a
hold
that
its
positions
were
soon
recognised
as
impregnable
leaders
like
the
schlegels
wilhelm
von
humboldt
and
above
all
franz
bopp
and
jacob
grimm
gave
such
additional
force
to
scientific
truth
that
it
could
no
longer
be
withstood
to
say
nothing
of
other
conquests
the
demonstration
of
that
great
law
in
philology
which
bears
grimm
name
brought
home
to
all
thinking
men
the
evidence
that
the
evolution
of
language
had
not
been
determined
by
the
philosophic
utterances
of
adam
in
naming
the
animals
which
jehovah
brought
before
him
but
in
obedience
to
natural
law
true
a
few
devoted
theologians
showed
themselves
willing
to
lead
a
forlorn
hope
and
perhaps
the
most
forlorn
of
all
was
that
of
led
by
gottlieb
christian
kayser
professor
of
theology
at
the
protestant
university
of
erlangen
he
does
not
indeed
dare
put
in
the
old
claim
that
hebrew
is
identical
with
the
primitive
tongue
but
he
insists
that
it
is
nearer
it
than
any
other
he
relinquishes
the
two
former
theological
strongholds
first
the
idea
that
language
was
taught
by
the
almighty
to
adam
and
next
that
the
alphabet
was
thus
taught
to
moses
and
falls
back
on
the
position
that
all
tongues
are
thus
derived
from
noah
giving
as
an
example
the
language
of
the
caribbees
and
insisting
that
it
was
evidently
so
derived
what
chance
similarity
in
words
between
hebrew
and
the
caribbee
tongue
he
had
in
mind
is
past
finding
out
he
comes
out
strongly
in
defence
of
the
biblical
account
of
the
tower
of
babel
and
insists
that
by
the
symbolical
expression
said
let
us
go
down
a
further
natural
phenomenon
is
intimated
to
wit
the
cleaving
of
the
earth
whereby
the
return
of
the
dispersed
became
impossible
that
is
to
say
through
a
new
or
not
universal
flood
a
partial
inundation
and
temporary
violent
separation
of
great
continents
until
the
time
of
the
rediscovery
by
these
words
the
learned
doctor
means
nothing
less
than
the
separation
of
europe
from
america
while
at
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
theory
of
the
origin
and
development
of
language
was
upon
the
continent
considered
as
settled
and
a
science
had
there
emerged
from
the
old
chaos
great
britain
still
held
back
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
most
important
contributors
to
the
science
were
of
british
origin
leaders
in
every
english
church
and
sect
vied
with
each
other
either
in
denouncing
the
encroachments
of
the
science
of
language
or
in
explaining
them
away
but
a
new
epoch
had
come
and
in
a
way
least
expected
perhaps
the
most
notable
effort
in
bringing
it
in
was
made
by
wiseman
afterward
cardinal
archbishop
of
westminster
his
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
a
method
which
has
been
used
with
considerable
effect
during
the
latest
stages
of
nearly
all
the
controversies
between
theology
and
science
it
consists
in
stating
with
much
fairness
the
conclusions
of
the
scientific
authorities
and
then
in
persuading
one
self
and
trying
to
persuade
others
that
the
church
has
always
accepted
them
and
accepts
them
now
as
additional
proofs
of
the
truth
of
scripture
a
little
juggling
with
words
a
little
amalgamation
of
texts
a
little
judicious
suppression
a
little
imaginative
deduction
a
little
unctuous
phrasing
and
the
thing
is
done
one
great
service
this
eminent
and
kindly
catholic
champion
undoubtedly
rendered
by
this
acknowledgment
so
widely
spread
in
his
published
lectures
he
made
it
impossible
for
catholics
or
protestants
longer
to
resist
the
main
conclusions
of
science
henceforward
we
only
have
efforts
to
save
theological
appearances
and
these
only
by
men
whose
zeal
outran
their
discretion
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
down
to
a
recent
period
we
see
these
efforts
but
we
see
no
less
clearly
that
they
are
mutually
destructive
yet
out
of
this
chaos
among
peoples
the
new
science
began
to
develop
steadily
and
rapidly
attempts
did
indeed
continue
here
and
there
to
save
the
old
theory
even
as
late
as
we
hear
the
eminent
presbyterian
divine
john
cumming
from
his
pulpit
in
london
speaking
of
hebrew
as
that
magnificent
tongue
that
from
which
all
others
are
but
distant
and
debilitated
progenies
but
the
honour
of
producing
in
the
nineteenth
century
the
most
absurd
known
attempt
to
prove
hebrew
the
primitive
tongue
belongs
to
the
youngest
of
the
continents
australia
in
the
year
was
printed
at
melbourne
the
triumph
of
truth
or
a
popular
lecture
on
the
origin
of
languages
by
atkinson
whatever
that
may
mean
in
this
work
starting
with
the
assertion
that
the
hebrew
was
the
primary
stock
whence
all
languages
were
derived
the
author
states
that
sanskrit
is
a
dialect
of
the
hebrew
and
declares
that
the
manuscripts
found
with
mummies
agree
precisely
with
the
chinese
version
of
the
psalms
of
david
it
all
sounds
like
alice
in
wonderland
curiously
enough
in
the
latter
part
of
his
book
evidently
thinking
that
his
views
would
not
give
him
authority
among
fastidious
philologists
he
says
a
great
deal
of
our
consent
to
the
foregoing
statements
arises
in
our
belief
in
the
divine
inspiration
of
the
mosaic
account
of
the
creation
of
the
world
and
of
our
first
parents
in
the
garden
of
eden
a
yet
more
interesting
light
is
thrown
upon
the
author
view
of
truth
and
of
its
promulgation
by
his
dedication
he
says
that
being
persuaded
that
literary
men
ought
to
be
fostered
by
the
hand
of
power
he
dedicates
his
treatise
to
his
excellency
sir
barkly
who
was
at
the
time
governor
of
victoria
still
another
curious
survival
is
seen
in
a
work
which
appeared
as
late
as
at
edinburgh
by
william
galloway
the
author
thinks
that
he
has
produced
abundant
evidence
to
prove
that
jehovah
the
second
person
of
the
godhead
wrote
the
first
chapter
of
genesis
on
a
stone
pillar
and
that
this
is
the
manner
by
which
he
first
revealed
it
to
adam
and
thus
adam
was
taught
not
only
to
speak
but
to
read
and
write
by
jehovah
the
divine
son
and
that
the
first
lesson
he
got
was
from
the
first
chapter
of
genesis
he
goes
on
to
say
jehovah
wrote
these
first
two
documents
the
first
containing
the
history
of
the
creation
and
the
second
the
revelation
of
man
redemption
for
adam
and
eve
instruction
it
is
evident
that
he
wrote
them
in
the
hebrew
tongue
because
that
was
the
language
of
adam
and
eve
but
this
was
only
a
flower
out
of
season
and
finally
in
these
latter
days
gladstone
has
touched
the
subject
with
that
facility
in
believing
anything
he
wishes
to
believe
which
he
once
showed
in
connecting
neptune
trident
with
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
he
floats
airily
over
all
the
impossibilities
of
the
original
babel
legend
and
all
the
conquests
of
science
makes
an
assertion
regarding
the
results
of
philology
which
no
philologist
of
any
standing
would
admit
and
then
escapes
in
a
cloud
of
rhetoric
after
his
fashion
this
too
must
be
set
down
simply
as
a
survival
for
in
the
british
isles
as
elsewhere
the
truth
has
been
established
such
men
as
max
muller
and
sayce
in
england
steinthal
schleicher
weber
karl
abel
and
a
host
of
others
in
germany
ascoli
and
de
gubernatis
in
italy
and
whitney
with
the
scholars
inspired
by
him
in
america
have
carried
the
new
science
to
a
complete
triumph
the
sons
of
yale
university
may
well
be
proud
of
the
fact
that
this
old
puritan
foundation
was
made
the
headquarters
of
the
american
oriental
society
which
has
done
so
much
for
the
truth
in
this
field
for
gladstone
view
see
his
impregnable
rock
of
holy
scripture
london
pp
et
seq
the
passage
connecting
the
trident
of
neptune
with
the
trinity
is
in
his
juventus
mundi
to
any
american
boy
who
sees
how
inevitably
both
among
indian
and
white
fishermen
the
fish
spear
takes
the
form
this
utterance
of
gladstone
is
amazing
summary
it
may
be
instructive
in
conclusion
to
sum
up
briefly
the
history
of
the
whole
struggle
first
as
to
the
origin
of
speech
we
have
in
the
beginning
the
whole
church
rallying
around
the
idea
that
the
original
language
was
hebrew
that
this
language
even
including
the
medieval
rabbinical
punctuation
was
directly
inspired
by
the
almighty
that
adam
was
taught
it
by
god
himself
in
walks
and
talks
and
that
all
other
languages
were
derived
from
it
at
the
confusion
of
babel
next
we
see
parts
of
this
theory
fading
out
the
inspiration
of
the
rabbinical
points
begins
to
disappear
adam
instead
of
being
taught
directly
by
god
is
inspired
by
him
then
comes
the
third
stage
advanced
theologians
endeavour
to
compromise
on
the
idea
that
adam
was
given
verbal
roots
and
a
mental
power
finally
in
our
time
we
have
them
accepting
the
theory
that
language
is
the
result
of
an
evolutionary
process
in
obedience
to
laws
more
or
less
clearly
ascertained
babel
thus
takes
its
place
quietly
among
the
sacred
myths
as
to
the
origin
of
writing
we
have
the
more
eminent
theologians
at
first
insisting
that
god
taught
adam
to
write
next
we
find
them
gradually
retreating
from
this
position
but
insisting
that
writing
was
taught
to
the
world
by
noah
after
the
retreat
from
this
position
we
find
them
insisting
that
it
was
moses
whom
god
taught
to
write
but
scientific
modes
of
thought
still
progressed
and
we
next
have
influential
theologians
agreeing
that
writing
was
a
mosaic
invention
this
is
followed
by
another
theological
retreat
to
the
position
that
writing
was
a
invention
finally
all
the
positions
are
relinquished
save
by
some
few
skirmishers
who
appear
now
and
then
upon
the
horizon
making
attempts
to
defend
some
subtle
method
of
reconciling
the
babel
myth
with
modern
science
just
after
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
last
stage
of
theological
defence
was
evidently
reached
the
same
which
is
seen
in
the
history
of
almost
every
science
after
it
has
successfully
fought
its
way
through
the
theological
period
the
declaration
which
we
have
already
seen
foreshadowed
by
wiseman
that
the
scientific
discoveries
in
question
are
nothing
new
but
have
really
always
been
known
and
held
by
the
church
and
that
they
simply
substantiate
the
position
taken
by
the
church
this
new
contention
which
always
betokens
the
last
gasp
of
theological
resistance
to
science
was
now
echoed
from
land
to
land
in
it
was
given
forth
by
a
divine
of
the
anglican
church
archdeacon
pratt
of
calcutta
he
gives
a
long
list
of
eminent
philologists
who
had
done
most
to
destroy
the
old
supernatural
view
of
language
reads
into
their
utterances
his
own
wishes
and
then
exclaims
so
singularly
do
their
labours
confirm
the
literal
truth
of
scripture
two
years
later
this
contention
was
echoed
from
the
american
presbyterian
church
and
dwight
having
stigmatized
as
infidels
those
who
had
not
incorporated
into
their
science
the
literal
acceptance
of
hebrew
legend
declared
that
chronology
ethnography
and
etymology
have
all
been
tortured
in
vain
to
make
them
contradict
the
mosaic
account
of
the
early
history
of
man
twelve
years
later
this
was
from
england
the
rev
baylee
principal
of
the
college
of
aidan
declared
with
regard
to
the
varieties
of
human
language
the
account
of
the
confusion
of
tongues
is
receiving
daily
confirmation
by
all
the
recent
discoveries
in
comparative
philology
so
too
in
the
same
year
in
the
united
presbyterian
church
of
scotland
john
eadie
professor
of
biblical
literature
and
exegesis
declared
comparative
philology
has
established
the
miracle
of
babel
a
skill
in
theology
and
casuistry
so
exquisite
as
to
contrive
such
assertions
and
a
faith
so
robust
as
to
accept
them
certainly
leave
nothing
to
be
desired
but
how
baseless
these
contentions
are
is
shown
first
by
the
simple
history
of
the
attitude
of
the
church
toward
this
question
and
secondly
by
the
fact
that
comparative
philology
now
reveals
beyond
a
doubt
that
not
only
is
hebrew
not
the
original
or
oldest
language
upon
earth
but
that
it
is
not
even
the
oldest
form
in
the
semitic
group
to
which
it
belongs
to
use
the
words
of
one
of
the
most
eminent
modern
authorities
it
is
now
generally
recognised
that
in
grammatical
structure
the
arabic
preserves
much
more
of
the
original
forms
than
either
the
hebrew
or
aramaic
history
ethnology
and
philology
now
combine
inexorably
to
place
the
account
of
the
confusion
of
tongues
and
the
dispersion
of
races
at
babel
among
the
myths
but
their
work
has
not
been
merely
destructive
more
and
more
strong
are
the
grounds
for
belief
in
an
evolution
of
language
a
very
complete
acceptance
of
the
scientific
doctrines
has
been
made
by
archdeacon
farrar
canon
of
westminster
with
a
boldness
which
in
an
earlier
period
might
have
cost
him
dear
and
which
merits
praise
even
now
for
its
courage
he
says
for
all
reasoners
except
that
portion
of
the
clergy
who
in
all
ages
have
been
found
among
the
bitterest
enemies
of
scientific
discovery
these
considerations
have
been
conclusive
but
strange
to
say
here
as
in
so
many
other
instances
this
orthodoxy
more
orthodox
than
the
bible
itself
directly
contradicts
the
very
scriptures
which
it
professes
to
explain
and
by
sheer
misrepresentation
succeeds
in
producing
a
needless
and
deplorable
collision
between
the
statements
of
scripture
and
those
other
mighty
and
certain
truths
which
have
been
revealed
to
science
and
humanity
as
their
glory
and
reward
still
another
acknowledgment
was
made
in
america
through
the
instrumentality
of
a
divine
of
the
methodist
episcopal
church
whom
the
present
generation
at
least
will

it
may
indeed
be
now
fairly
said
that
the
thinking
leaders
of
theology
have
come
to
accept
the
conclusions
of
science

the
origin

against
the
old
explanations

legend
the
result
has
been
a
blessing
both
to

and
to

no
harm
has
been
done

what
has
been
done
is
to

it

the
almighty
lest
men
might
climb
up
into
his
realm
above
the
firmament
and
of
the
confusion
of
tongues
and
the
dispersion
of
nations
the
essentials
of
christianity
as
taught
by
its
blessed
founder
have
simply
been
freed
by
comparative
philology
from
one
more
great
incubus
and
have
therefore
been
left
to
work
with
more
power
upon
the
hearts
and
minds
of
mankind
nor
has
any
harm
been
done
to
the
bible
on
the
contrary
this
divine
revelation
through
science
has
made
it
all
the
more
precious
to
us
in
these
myths
and
legends
caught
from
earlier
civilizations
we
see
an
evolution
of
the
most
important
religious
and
moral
truths
for
our
race
myth
legend
and
parable
seem
in
obedience
to
a
divine
law
the
necessary
setting
for
these
truths
as
they
are
successively
evolved
ever
in
higher
and
higher
forms
what
matters
it
then
that
we
have
come
to
know
that
the
accounts
of
creation
the
fall
the
deluge
and
much
else
in
our
sacred
books
were
remembrances
of
lore
obtained
from
the
chaldeans
what
matters
it
that
the
beautiful
story
of
joseph
is
found
to
be
in
part
derived
from
an
egyptian
romance
of
which
the
hieroglyphs
may
still
be
seen
what
matters
it
that
the
story
of
david
and
goliath
is
poetry
and
that
samson
like
so
many
men
of
strength
in
other
religions
is
probably
a
what
matters
it
that
the
inculcation
of
high
duty
in
the
childhood
of
the
world
is
embodied
in
such
quaint
stories
as
those
of
jonah
and
balaam
the
more
we
realize
these
facts
the
richer
becomes
that
great
body
of
literature
brought
together
within
the
covers
of
the
bible
what
matters
it
that
those
who
incorporated
the
creation
lore
of
babylonia
and
other
oriental
nations
into
the
sacred
books
of
the
hebrews
mixed
it
with
their
own
conceptions
and
deductions
what
matters
it
that
darwin
changed
the
whole
aspect
of
our
creation
myths
that
lyell
and
his
compeers
placed
the
hebrew
story
of
creation
and
of
the
deluge
of
noah
among
legends
that
copernicus
put
an
end
to
the
standing
still
of
the
sun
for
joshua
that
halley
in
promulgating
his
law
of
comets
put
an
end
to
the
doctrine
of
signs
and
wonders
that
pinel
in
showing
that
all
insanity
is
physical
disease
relegated
to
the
realm
of
mythology
the
witch
of
endor
and
all
stories
of
demoniacal
possession
that
the
rev
schaff
and
a
multitude
of
recent
christian
travellers
in
palestine
have
put
into
the
realm
of
legend
the
story
of
lot
wife
transformed
into
a
pillar
of
salt
that
the
anthropologists
by
showing
how
man
has
risen
everywhere
from
low
and
brutal
beginnings
have
destroyed
the
whole
theological
theory
of
the
fall
of
man
our
great
body
of
sacred
literature
is
thereby
only
made
more
and
more
valuable
to
us
more
and
more
we
see
how
long
and
patiently
the
forces
in
the
universe
which
make
for
righteousness
have
been
acting
in
and
upon
mankind
through
the
only
agencies
fitted
for
such
work
in
the
earliest
ages
of
the

a

since
maxime
du
camp
an
eminent
member
of
the
french
academy
travelling
from
the
red
sea
to
the
nile
through
the
desert
of
kosseir
came
to
a
barren
slope
covered
with
boulders
rounded
and
glossy
his
mohammedan
accounted
for
them
on
this
wise
many
years
ago
hadji
a
sheik
of
the
dervishes
was
travelling
on
foot
through
this
desert
it
was
summer
the
sun
was
hot
and
the
dust
stifling
thirst
parched
his
lips
fatigue
weighed
down
his
back
sweat
dropped
from
his
forehead
when
looking
up
he
saw
on
this
very
spot
a
garden
beautifully
green
full
of
fruit
and
in
the
midst
of
it
the
gardener
cried
hadji
the
name
of
allah
clement
and
merciful
give
me
a
melon
and
i
will
give
you
my
prayers
the
gardener
answered
care
not
for
your
prayers
give
me
money
and
i
will
give
you
fruit
said
the
dervish
am
a
beggar
i
have
never
had
money
i
am
thirsty
and
weary
and
one
of
your
melons
is
all
that
i
need
said
the
gardener
to
the
nile
and
quench
your
thirst
thereupon
the
dervish
lifting
his
eyes
toward
heaven
made
this
prayer
allah
thou
who
in
the
midst
of
the
desert
didst
make
the
fountain
of
spring
forth
to
satisfy
the
thirst
of
ismail
father
of
the
faithful
wilt
thou
suffer
one
of
thy
creatures
to
perish
thus
of
thirst
and
fatigue
and
it
came
to
pass
that
hardly
had
the
dervish
spoken
when
an
abundant
dew
descended
upon
him
quenching
his
thirst
and
refreshing
him
even
to
the
marrow
of
his
bones
now
at
the
sight
of
this
miracle
the
gardener
knew
that
the
dervish
was
a
holy
man
beloved
of
allah
and
straightway
offered
him
a
melon
so
answered
hadji
what
thou
hast
thou
wicked
man
may
thy
melons
become
as
hard
as
thy
heart
and
thy
field
as
barren
as
thy
soul
and
straightway
it
came
to
pass
that
the
melons
were
changed
into
these
blocks
of
stone
and
the
grass
into
this
sand
and
never
since
has
anything
grown
thereon
in
this
story
and
in
myriads
like
it
we
have
a
survival
of
that
early
conception
of
the
universe
in
which
so
many
of
the
leading
moral
and
religious
truths
of
the
great
sacred
books
of
the
world
are
imbedded
all
ancient
sacred
lore
abounds
in
such
mythical
explanations
of
remarkable
appearances
in
nature
and
these
are
most
frequently
prompted
by
mountains
rocks
and
boulders
seemingly
misplaced
in
india
we
have
such
typical
examples
among
the
brahmans
as
the
which
durgu
threw
at
parvati
and
among
the
buddhists
the
stone
which
devadatti
hurled
at
buddha
in
greece
the
athenian
rejoicing
in
his
belief
that
athena
guarded
her
chosen
people
found
it
hard
to
understand
why
the
great
rock
lycabettus
should
be
just
too
far
from
the
acropolis
to
be
of
use
as
an
outwork
but
a
myth
was
developed
which
explained
all
according
to
this
athena
had
intended
to
make
lycabettus
a
defence
for
the
athenians
and
she
was
bringing
it
through
the
air
from
pallene
for
that
very
purpose
but
unfortunately
a
raven
met
her
and
informed
her
of
the
wonderful
birth
of
erichthonius
which
so
surprised
the
goddess
that
she
dropped
the
rock
where
it
now
stands
so
too
a
peculiar
rock
at
aegina
was
accounted
for
by
a
long
and
circumstantial
legend
to
the
effect
that
peleus
threw
it
at
phocas
a
similar
mode
of
explaining
such
objects
is
seen
in
the
mythologies
of
northern
europe
in
scandinavia
we
constantly
find
rocks
which
tradition
accounts
for
by
declaring
that
they
were
hurled
by
the
old
gods
at
each
other
or
at
the
early
christian
churches
in
teutonic
lands
as
a
rule
wherever
a
strange
rock
or
stone
is
found
there
will
be
found
a
myth
or
a
legend
heathen
or
christian
to
account
for
it
so
too
in
celtic
countries
typical
of
this
mode
of
thought
in
brittany
and
in
ireland
is
the
popular
belief
that
such
features
in
the
landscape
were
dropped
by
the
devil
or
by
fairies
even
at
a
much
later
period
such
myths
have
grown
and
bloomed
marco
polo
gives
a
long
and
circumstantial
legend
of
a
mountain
in
asia
minor
which
not
long
before
his
visit
was
removed
by
a
christian
who
having
faith
as
a
grain
of
mustard
seed
and
remembering
the
promise
transferred
the
mountain
to
its
present
place
by
prayer
at
which
marvel
many

christians

out

we
may
take
one
or
two
as
typical
one
of
the
most
beautiful
was
evolved
at
rome
on
the
border
of
the
medieval
city
stands
the
church
of
domine
quo
vadis
it
was
erected
in
honour
of
a
stone
which
is
still
preserved
bearing
a
mark
resembling
a
human
footprint
perhaps
the
bed
of
a
fossil
out
of
this
a
pious
legend
grew
as
naturally
as
a
wild
rose
in
a
prairie
according
to
this
story
in
one
of
the
first
great
persecutions
the
heart
of
peter
failed
him
and
he
attempted
to
flee
from
the
city
arriving
outside
the
walls
he
was
suddenly
confronted
by
the
master
whereupon
peter
in
amazement
asked
lord
whither
goest
thou
domine
quo
vadis
to
which
the
master
answered
to
rome
to
be
crucified
again
the
apostle
thus
rebuked
returned
to
martyrdom
the
master
vanished
but
left
as
a
perpetual
memorial
his
footprint
in
the
solid
rock
another
legend
accounts
for
a
curious
mark
in
a
stone
at
jerusalem
according
to
this
thomas
after
the
ascension
of
the
lord
was
again
troubled
with
doubts
whereupon
the
virgin
mother
threw
down
her
girdle
which
left
its
imprint
upon
the
rock
and
thus
converted
the
doubter
fully
and
finally
and
still
another
example
is
seen
at
the
very
opposite
extreme
of
europe
in
the
legend
of
the
priestess
of
hertha
in
the
island
of
rugen
she
had
been
unfaithful
to
her
vows
and
the
gods
furnished
a
proof
of
her
guilt
by
causing
her
and
her
child

every
schoolboy
knows
when
he
has
read
his
virgil
in

later
christian
mythologies
we
have
such
typical
legends
as
those
which
grew
up
about
the
old
crater
in
ceylon
the
salt
water
in
it
being
accounted
for
by
supposing
it
the
tears
of
adam
and
eve
who
retreated
to
this
point
after
their
expulsion
from
paradise
and
bewailed
their
sin
during
a
hundred
years
so
too
in
germany
we
have
multitudes
of
lakes
supposed
to
owe
their
origin
to
the
sinking
of
valleys
as
a
punishment
for
human
sin

these
are

lake

to
the
same
manner
of
explaining
striking
appearances
in
physical
geography
and
especially
strange
rocks
and
boulders
we
mainly
owe
the
innumerable
stories
of
the
transformation
of
living
beings
and
especially
of
men
and
women
into
these
natural
features
in
the
mythology
of
china
we
constantly
come
upon
legends
of
such
transformations
from
that
of
the
first
counsellor
of
the
han
dynasty
to
those
of
shepherds
and
sheep
in
the
brahmanic
mythology
of
india
salagrama
the
fossil
ammonite
is
recognised
as
containing
the
body
of
vishnu
wife
and
the
binlang
stone
has
much
the
same
relation
to
siva
so
too
the
nymph
ramba
was
changed
for
offending
ketu
into
a
mass
of
sand
by
the
breath
of
siva
elephants
were
turned
into
stone
and
in
a
very
touching
myth
luxman
is
changed
into
stone
but
afterward
released
in
the
buddhist
mythology
a
nat
demon
is
represented
as
changing
himself
into
a
grain
of
sand
among
the
greeks
such
transformation
myths
come
constantly
before
us
both
the
changing
of
stones
to
men
and
the
changing
of
men
to
stones
deucalion
and
pyrrha
escaping
from
the
flood
repeopled
the
earth
by
casting
behind
them
stones
which
became
men
and
women
heraulos

stone
for
offending
mercury
pyrrhus
for
offending
rhea
phineus
and
polydectes
with
his
guests
for
offending
perseus
under
the
petrifying
glance
of
medusa
head
such
transformations
became
a
thing
of
course
to
in
obedience
to
the
desire
of
explaining
unusual
natural
appearances
coupled
with
the
idea
that
sin
must
be
followed
by
retribution
we
also
owe
the
niobe
myth
having
incurred
the
divine
wrath
niobe
saw
those
dearest
to
her
destroyed
by
missiles
from
heaven
and
was
finally
transformed
into
a
rock
on
mount
sipylos
which
bore
some
vague
resemblance
to
the
human
form
and
her
tears
became
the
rivulets
which
trickled
from
the
neighbouring
strata
thus
in
obedience
to
a
moral
and
intellectual
impulse
a
striking
geographical
appearance
was
explained
and
for
ages
pious
greeks
looked
with
bated
breath
upon
the
rock
at
sipylos
which
was
once
niobe
just
as
for
ages
pious
jews
christians
and
mohammedans
looked
with
awe
upon
the
salt
pillar
at
the
dead
sea
which
was
once
lot
wife
pausanias
one
of
the
most
honest
of
ancient
travellers
gives
us
a
notable
exhibition
of
this
feeling
having
visited
this
monument
of
divine
vengeance
at
mount
sipylos
he
tells
us
very
naively
that
though
he
could
discern
no
human
features
when
standing
near
it
he
thought
that
he
could
see
them
when
standing
at
a
distance
there
could
hardly
be
a
better
example
of
that
most
common
and
deceptive
of
all
things
belief
created
by
the
desire
to
believe
in
the
pagan
mythology
of
scandinavia
we
have
such
typical
examples
as
bors
slaying
the
giant
ymir
and
transforming
his
bones
into
boulders
also
the
giant
who
had
no
heart
transforming
six
brothers
and
their
wives
into
stone
and
in
the
old
christian
mythology
olaf
changing
into
stone
the
wicked
giants
who
opposed
his
preaching
so
too
in
celtic
countries
we
have
in
ireland
such
legends
as
those
of
the
dancers
turned
into
stone
and
in
brittany
the
stones
at
plesse
which
were
once
hunters
and
dogs
violating
the
sanctity
of
sunday
and
the
stones
of
carnac
which
were
once
soldiers
who
sought
to
kill
cornely
teutonic
mythology
inherited
from
its
earlier
eastern
days
a
similar
mass
of
old
legends
and
developed
a
still
greater
mass
of
new
ones
thus
near
the
konigstein
which
all
visitors
to
the
saxon
switzerland
know
so
well
is
a
boulder
which
for
ages
was
believed
to
have
once
been
a
maiden
transformed
into
stone
for
refusing
to
go
to
church
and
near
rosenberg
in
mecklenburg
is
another
curiously
shaped
stone
of
which
a
similar
story
is
told
near
spornitz
in
the
same
region
are
seven
boulders
whose
forms
and
position
are
accounted
for
by
a
long
and
circumstantial
legend
that
they
were
once
seven
impious
herdsmen
near
brahlsdorf
is
a
stone
which
according
to
a
similar
explanatory
myth
was
once
a
blasphemous
shepherd
near
schwerin
are
three
boulders
which
were
once
wasteful
servants
and
at
neustadt
down
to
a
recent
period
was
shown
a
collection
of
stones
which
were
once
a
bride
and
bridegroom
with
their
horses
all
punished
for
an
act
of
cruelty
and
these
stories
are
but
typical
of
thousands
at
the
other
extremity
of
europe
we
may
take
out
of
the
multitude
of
explanatory
myths
that
which
grew
about
the
group
of
boulders
near
belgrade
in
the
midst
of
them
stands
one
larger
than
the
rest
according
to
the
legend
which
was
developed
to
account
for
all
these
there
once
lived
there
a
swineherd
who
was
disrespectful
to
the
consecrated
host
whereupon
he
was
changed
into
the
larger
stone
and
his
swine
into
the
smaller
ones
so
also
at
saloniki
we
have
the
pillars
of
the
ruined
temple
which
are
widely
believed
especially
among
the
jews
of
that
region
to
have
once
been
human
beings
and
are
therefore
known
as
the
enchanted
columns
among
the
arabs
we
have
an
addition
to
our
sacred
account
of
adam
the
legend
of
the
black
stone
of
the
caaba
at
mecca
into
which
the
angel
was
changed
who
was
charged
by
the
almighty
to
keep
adam
away
from
the
forbidden
fruit
and
who
neglected
his
duty
similar
old
transformation
legends
are
abundant
among
the
indians
of
america
the
negroes
of
africa
and
the
natives
of
australia
and
the
pacific
islands
nor
has
this
making
of
myths
to
account
for
remarkable
appearances
yet
ceased
even
in
civilized
countries
about
the
beginning
of
this
century
the
grand
duke
of
weimar
smitten
with
the
classical
mania
of
his
time
placed
in
the
public
park
near
his
palace
a
little
altar
and
upon
this
was
carved
after
the
manner
so
frequent
in
classical
antiquity
a
serpent
taking
a
cake
from
it
and
shortly
there
appeared
in
the
town
and
the
country
round
about
a
legend
to
explain
this
altar
and
its
decoration
it
was
commonly
said
that
a
huge
serpent
had
laid
waste
that
region
in
the
olden
time
until
a
wise
and
benevolent
baker
had
rid
the
world
of
the
monster
by
means
of
a
poisoned
biscuit
so
too
but
a
few
years
since
in
the
heart
of
the
state
of
new
york
a
swindler
of
genius
having
made
and
buried
a
petrified
giant
one
theologian
explained
it
by
declaring
it
a
phoenician
idol
and
published
the
phoenician
inscription
which
he
thought
he
had
found
upon
it
others
saw
in
it
proofs
that
there
were
giants
in
those
days
and
within
a
week
after
its
discovery
myths
were
afloat
that
the
neighbouring
remnant
of
the
onondaga
indians
had
traditions
of
giants
who
frequently
roamed
through
that
region

transformation

and
hopes
ere
long
to
prepare
a
supplement
to
valuable
paper
to
the
same
stage
of
thought
belongs
the
conception
of
human
beings
changed
into
trees
but
in
the
historic
evolution
of
religion
and
morality
while
changes
into
stone
or
rock
were
considered
as
punishments
or
evidences
of
divine
wrath
those
into
trees
and
shrubs
were
frequently
looked
upon
as
rewards
or
evidences
of
divine
favour
a
very
beautiful
and
touching
form
of
this
conception
is
seen
in
such
myths
as
the
change
of
philemon
into
the
oak
and
of
baucis
into
the
linden
of
myrrha
into
the
myrtle
of
melos
into
the
apple
tree
of
attis
into
the
pine
of
adonis
into
the
rose
tree
and
in
the
springing
of
the
vine
and
grape
from
the
blood
of
the
titans
the
violet
from
the
blood
of
attis
and
the
hyacinth
from
the
blood
of
hyacinthus
thus
it
was
during
the
long
ages
when
mankind
saw
everywhere
miracle
and
nowhere
law
that
in
the
evolution
of
religion
and
morality
striking
features
in
physical
geography
became
connected
with
the
idea
of
divine
retribution
for
the
view
taken
in
greece
and
rome
of
transformations
into
trees
and
shrubs
see
botticher
baumcultus
der
hellenen
book
i
chap
xix
also
ovid
metamorphoses
passim
also
foregoing
notes
but
in
the
natural
course
of
intellectual
growth
thinking
men
began
to
doubt
the
historical
accuracy
of
these
myths
and
legends
or
at
least
to
doubt
all
save
those
of
the
theology
in
which
they
happened
to
be
born
and
the
next
step
was
taken
when
they
began
to
make
comparisons
between
the
myths
and
legends
of
different
neighbourhoods
and
countries
so
came
into
being
the
science
of
comparative
mythology
a
science
sure
to
be
of
vast
value
because
despite
many
stumblings
and
vagaries
it
shows
ever
more
and
more
how
our
religion
and
morality
have
been
gradually
evolved
and
gives
a
firm
basis
to
a
faith
that
higher
planes
may
yet
be
reached
such
a
science
makes
the
sacred
books
of
the
world
more
and
more
precious
in
that
it
shows
how
they
have
been
the
necessary
envelopes
of
our
highest
spiritual
sustenance
how
even
myths
and
legends
apparently
the
most
puerile
have
been
the
natural
husks
and
rinds
and
shells
of
our
best
ideas
and
how
the
atmosphere
is
created
in
which
these
husks
and
rinds
and
shells
in
due
time
wither
shrivel
and
fall
away
so
that
the
fruit
itself
may
be
gathered
to
sustain
a
nobler
religion
and
a
purer
morality
the
coming
in
of
christianity
contributed
elements
of
inestimable
value
in
this
evolution
and
at
the
centre
of
all
the
thoughts
words
and
life
of
the
master
but
when
in
the
darkness
that
followed
the
downfall
of
the
roman
empire
there
was
developed
a
theology
and
a
vast
ecclesiastical
power
to
enforce
it
the
most
interesting
chapters
in
this
evolution
of
religion
and
morality
were
removed
from
the
domain
of
science
so
it
came
that
for
over
eighteen
hundred
years
it
has
been
thought
natural
and
right
to
study
and
compare
the
myths
and
legends
arising
east
and
west
and
south
and
north
of
palestine
with
each
other
but
never
with
those
of
palestine
itself
so
it
came
that
one
of
the
regions
most
fruitful
in
materials
for
reverent
thought
and
healthful
comparison
was
held
exempt
from
the
unbiased
search
for
truth
so
it
came
that
in
the
name
of
truth
truth
was
crippled
for
ages
while
observation
and
thought
upon
observation
and
the
organized
knowledge
or
science
which
results
from
these
progressed
as
regarded
the
myths
and
legends
of
other
countries
and
an
atmosphere
was
thus
produced
giving
purer
conceptions
of
the
world
and
its
government
myths
of
that
little
geographical
region
at
the
eastern
end
of
the
mediterranean
retained
possession
of
the
civilized
world
in
their
original
crude
form
and
have
at
times
done
much
to
thwart
the
noblest
efforts
of
religion
morality
and
civilization

the
history
of

of

but
since
to
treat
it
as
a
whole
would
require
volumes
i
shall
select
only
one
small
group
and
out
of
this
mainly
a
single
myth
one
about
which
there
can
no
longer
be
any
dispute
the
group
of
myths
and
legends
which
grew
upon
the
shore
of
the
dead
sea
and
especially
that
one
which
grew
up
to
account
for
the
successive
salt
columns
washed
out
by
the
rains
at
its
southwestern
extremity
the
dead
sea
is
about
fifty
miles
in
length
and
ten
miles
in
width
it
lies
in
a
very
deep
fissure
extending
north
and
south
and
its
surface
is
about
thirteen
hundred
feet
below
that
of
the
mediterranean
it
has
therefore
no
outlet
and
is
the
receptacle
for
the
waters
of
the
whole
system
to
which
it
belongs
including
those
collected
by
the
sea
of
galilee
and
brought
down
thence
by
the
river
jordan
it
certainly
or
at
least
the
larger
part
of
it
ranks
geologically
among
the
oldest
lakes
on
earth
in
a
broad
sense
the
region
is
volcanic
on
its
shore
are
evidences
of
volcanic
action
which
must
from
the
earliest
period
have
aroused
wonder
and
fear
and
stimulated
the
tendency
to
account
for
them
on
the
eastern
side
are
impressive
mountain
masses
which
have
been
thrown
up
from
old
volcanic
vents
mineral
and
hot
springs
abound
some
of
them
spreading
sulphurous
odours
earthquakes
have
been
frequent
and
from
time
to
time
these
have
cast
up
masses
of
bitumen
concretions
of
sulphur
and
large
formations
of
salt
constantly
appear
the
water
which
comes
from
the
springs
or
oozes
through
the
salt
layers
upon
its
shores
constantly
brings
in
various
salts
in
solution
and
being
rapidly
evaporated
under
the
hot
sun
and
dry
wind
there
has
been
left
in
the
bed
of
the
lake
a
strong
brine
heavily
charged
with
the
usual
chlorides
and
bromides
a
sort
of
bitter
mother
liquor
this
fluid
has
become
so
dense
as
to
have
a
remarkable
power
of
supporting
the
human
body
it
is
of
an
acrid
and
nauseating
bitterness
and
by
ordinary
eyes
no
evidence
of
life
is
seen
in
it
thus
it
was
that
in
the
lake
itself
and
in
its
surrounding
shores
there
was
enough
to
make
the
generation
of
explanatory
myths
on
a
large
scale
inevitable
the
main
northern
part
of
the
lake
is
very
deep
the
plummet
having
shown
an
abyss
of
thirteen
hundred
feet
but
the
southern
end
is
shallow
and
in
places
marshy
the
system
of
which
it
forms
a
part
shows
a
likeness
to
that
in
south
america
of
which
the
mountain
lake
titicaca
is
the
main
feature
as
a
receptacle
for
surplus
waters
only
rendering
them
by
evaporation
it
resembles
the
caspian
and
many
other
seas
as
a
sort
of
evaporating
dish
for
the
leachings
of
salt
rock
and
consequently
holding
a
body
of
water
unfit
to
support
the
higher
forms
of
animal
life
it
resembles
among
others
the
median
lake
of
urumiah
as
a
deposit
of
bitumen
it
resembles
the
pitch

in

there

nothing
presenting

difficulty
to

or
geographer
but
with
the
early
dweller
in
palestine
the
case
was
very
different
the
rocky
barren
desolation
of
the
dead
sea
region
impressed
him
deeply
he
naturally
reasoned
upon
it
and
this
impression
and
reasoning
we
find
stamped
into
the
pages
of
his
sacred
literature
rendering
them
all
the
more
precious
as
a
revelation
of
the
earlier
thought
of
mankind
the
long
circumstantial
account
given
in
genesis
its
application
in
deuteronomy
its
use
by
amos
by
isaiah
by
jeremiah
by
zephaniah
and
by
ezekiel
the
references
to
it
in
the
writings
attributed
to
paul
peter
and
jude
in
the
apocalypse
and
above
all
in
more
than
one
utterance
of
the
master
himself
all
show
how
deeply
these
geographical
features
impressed
the
jewish
mind
at
a
very
early
period
myths
and
legends
many
and
circumstantial
grew
up
to
explain
features
then
so
incomprehensible
as
the
myth
and
legend
grew
up
among
the
greeks
of
a
refusal
of
hospitality
to
zeus
and
hermes
by
the
village
in
phrygia
and
the
consequent
sinking
of
that
beautiful
region
with
its
inhabitants
beneath
a
lake
and
morass
so
there
came
belief
in
a
similar
offence
by
the
people
of
the
beautiful
valley
of
siddim
and
the
consequent
sinking
of
that
valley
with
its
inhabitants
beneath
the
waters
of
the
dead
sea
very
similar
to
the
accounts
of
the
saving
of
philemon
and
baucis
are
those
of
the
saving
of
lot
and
his
family
but
the
and
by
no
means
ceased
in
ancient
times
they
continued
to
grow
through
the
medieval
and
modern
period
until
they
have
quietly
withered
away
in
the
light
of
modern
scientific
investigation
leaving
to
us
the
religious
and
moral
truths
they
inclose
it
would
be
interesting
to
trace
this
whole
group
of
myths
their
origin
in
times
prehistoric
their
development
in
greece
and
rome
their
culmination
during
the
ages
of
faith
and
their
disappearance
in
the
age
of
science
it
would
be
especially
instructive
to
note
the
conscientious
efforts
to
prolong
their
life
by
making
futile
compromises
between
science
and
theology
regarding
them
but
i
shall
mention
this
main
group
only
incidentally
confining
my
self
almost
entirely
to
the
one
above
named
the
most
remarkable
of
all
the
myth
which
grew
about
the
salt
pillars
of
usdum
i
select
this
mainly
because
it
involves
only
elementary
principles
requires
no
abstruse
reasoning
and
because
all
controversy
regarding
it
is
ended
there
is
certainly
now
no
theologian
with
a
reputation
to
lose
who
will
venture
to
revive
the
idea
regarding
it
which
was
sanctioned
for
hundreds
nay
thousands
of
years
by
theology
was
based
on
scripture
and
was
held
by
the
universal
church
until
our
own
century
the
main
feature
of
the
salt
region
of
usdum
is
a
low
range
of
hills
near
the
southwest
corner
of
the
dead
sea
extending
in
a
southeasterly
direction
for
about
five
miles
and
made
up
mainly
of
salt
rock
this
rock
is
soft
and
friable
and
under
the
influence
of
the
heavy
winter
rains
it
has
been
without
doubt
from
a
period
long
before
human
history
as
it
is
now
cut
ever
into
new
shapes
and
especially
into
pillars
or
columns
which
sometimes
bear
a
resemblance
to
the
human
form
an
eminent
clergyman
who
visited
this
spot
recently
speaks
of
the
appearance
of
this
salt
range
as
follows
fretted
by
fitful
showers
and
storms
its
ridge
is
exceedingly
uneven
its
sides
carved
out
and
constantly
changing
and
each
traveller
might
have
a
new
pillar
of
salt
to
wonder
over
at
intervals
of
a
few
years
as
to
the
substance
of
the
pillars
or
statues
or
needles
of
salt
at
usdum
many
travellers
speak
of
it
as
marl
and
salt
irby
and
mangles
in
their
travels
in
egypt
nubia
syria
and
the
holy
land
chap
vii
call
it
salt
and
hardened
sand
the
citation
as
to
frequent
carving
out
of
new
pillars
is
from
the
travels
in
palestine
of
the
rev
osborn
see
also

the
exodus
vol
ii
pp
for
engravings
of
the
salt
pillar
at
different
times
compare
that
given
by
lynch
in
when
it
appeared
as
a
column
forty
feet
high
with
that
given
by
palmer
as
the
frontpiece
to
his
desert
of
the
exodus
cambridge
england
when
it
was
small
and
does
really
bear
a
curious
resemblance
to
an
arab
woman
with
a
child
upon
he
shoulders
and
this
again
with
the
picture
of
the
salt
formation
at
usdum
given
by
canon
tristram
at
whose
visit
there
was
neither
pillar
nor
statue
see

land
of
israel
by
tristram
london
for
similar
pillars
of
salt
washed

from
the
mud

catalonia
see
lyell
few
things
could
be
more
certain
than
that
in
the
indolent
of
the
east
myths
and
legends
would
grow
up
to
account
for
this
as
for
other
strange
appearances
in
all
that
region
the
question
which
a
religious
oriental
put
to
himself
in
ancient
times
at
usdum
was
substantially
that
which
his
descendant
puts
to
himself
at
kosseir
why
is
this
region
thus
blasted
whence
these
pillars
of
salt
or
whence
these
blocks
of
granite
what
aroused
the
vengeance
of
jehovah
or
of
allah
to
work
these
miracles
of
desolation
and
just
as
maxime
du
camp
recorded
the
answer
of
the
modern
shemite
at
kosseir
so
the
compilers
of
the
jewish
sacred
books
recorded
the
answer
of
the
ancient
shemite
at
the
dead
sea
just
as
allah
at
kosseir
blasted
the
land
and
transformed
the
melons
into
boulders
which
are
seen
to
this
day
so
jehovah
at
usdum
blasted
the
land
and
transformed
lot
wife
into
a
pillar
of
salt
which
is
seen
to
this
day
no
more
difficulty
was
encountered
in
the
formation
of
the
lot
legend
to
account
for
that
rock
resembling
the
human
form
than
in
the
formation
of
the
niobe
legend
which
accounted
for
a
supposed
resemblance
in
the
rock
at
sipylos
it
grew
up
just
as
we
have
seen
thousands
of
similar
myths
and
legends
grow
up
about
striking
natural
appearances
in
every
early
home
of
the
human
race
being
thus
consonant
with
the
universal
view
regarding
the
relation
of
physical
geography
to
the
divine
government
it
became
a
treasure
of
the
jewish
nation
and
of
the
christian
church
a
treasure
not
only
to
be
guarded
against
all
hostile
intrusion
but
to
be
increased
as
we
shall
see
by
the
powers
of
jews
christians
and
mohammedans
for
thousands
of
years
the
spot
where
the
myth
originated
was
carefully
kept
in
mind
indeed
it
could
not
escape
for
in
that
place
alone
were
constantly
seen
the
phenomena
which
gave
rise
to
it
we
have
a
steady
chain
of
testimony
through
the
ages
all
pointing
to
the
salt
pillar
as
the
irrefragable
evidence
of
divine
judgment
that
great
theological
test
of
truth
the
dictum
of
vincent
of
lerins
would
certainly
prove
that
the
pillar
was
lot
wife
for
it
was
believed
so
to
be
by
jews
christians
and
mohammedans
from
the
earliest
period
down
to
a
time
almost
within
present
memory
always
everywhere
and
by
all
it
would
stand
perfectly
the
ancient
test
insisted
upon
by
cardinal
newman
securus
judicat
orbis
terrarum
for
ever
since
the
earliest
days
of
christianity
the
identity
of
the
salt
pillar
with
lot
wife
has
been
universally
held
and
supported
by
passages
in
genesis
in
luke
gospel
and
in
the
second
epistle
of
peter
coupled
with
a
passage
in
the
book
of
the
wisdom
of
solomon
which
to
this
day
by
a
majority
in
the
christian
church
is
believed
to
be
inspired
and
from
which
are
specially
cited
the
words
a
standing
pillar
of
salt
is
a
monument
of
an
unbelieving
soul

and
never
was
chain
of
belief
more
continuous
in

first
century
of
the
christian
era
josephus
refers
to
the
miracle
and
declares
regarding
the
statue
i
have
seen
it
and
it
remains
at
this
day
and
clement
bishop
of
rome
one
of
the
most
revered
fathers
of
the
church
noted
for
the
moderation
of
his
statements
expresses
a
similar
certainty
declaring
the
miraculous
statue
to
be
still
standing
in
the
second
century
that
great
father
of
the
church
bishop
and
martyr
irenaeus
not
only
vouched
for
it
but
gave
his
approval
to
the
belief
that
the
soul
of
lot
wife
still
lingered
in
the
statue
giving
it
a
sort
of
organic
life
thus
virtually
began
in
the
church
that
amazing
development
of
the
legend
which
we
shall
see
taking
various
forms
through
the
middle
ages
the
story
that
the
salt
statue
exercised
certain
physical
functions
which
in
these
more
delicate
days
can
not
be
alluded
to
save
under
cover
of
a
dead
language
this
addition
to
the
legend
which
in
these
signs
of
life
as
in
other
things
is
developed
almost
exactly
on
the
same
lines
with
the
legend
of
the
niobe
statue
in
the
rock
of
mount
sipylos
and
with
the
legends
of
human
beings
transformed
into
boulders
in
various
mythologies
was
for
centuries
regarded
as
an
additional
confirmation
of
revealed
truth
in
the
third
century
the
myth
burst
into
still
richer
bloom
in
a
poem
long
ascribed
to
tertullian
in
this
poem
more
miraculous
characteristics
of
the
statue
are
revealed
it
could
not
be
washed
away
by
rains
it
could
not
be
overthrown
by
winds
any
wound
made
upon
it
was
miraculously
healed
and
the
earlier
statements
as
to
its
physical
functions
were
amplified
in
sonorous
latin
verse
with
this
appeared
a
new
legend
regarding
the
dead
sea
it
became
universally
believed
and
we
find
it
repeated
throughout
the
whole
medieval
period
that
the
bitumen
could
only
he
dissolved
by
such
fluids
as
in
the
processes
of
animated
nature
came
from
the
statue
the
legend
thus
amplified
we
shall
find
dwelt
upon
by
pious
travellers
and
monkish
chroniclers
for
hundreds
of
years
so
it
came
to
be
more
and
more
treasured
by
the
universal
church
and
held
more
and
more
firmly
always
everywhere
and
by
all
in
the
two
following
centuries
we
have
an
overwhelming
mass
of
additional
authority
for
the
belief
that
the
very
statue
of
salt
into
which
lot
wife
was
transformed
was
still
existing
in
the
fourth
the
continuance
of
the
statue
was
vouched
for
by
silvia
who
visited
the
place
though
she
could
not
see
it
she
was
told
by
the
bishop
of
segor
that
it
had
been
there
some
time
before
and
she
concluded
that
it
had
been
temporarily
covered
by
the
sea
in
both
the
fourth
and
fifth
centuries
such
great
doctors
in
the
church
as
jerome
john
chrysostom
and
cyril
of
jerusalem
agreed
in
this
belief
and
statement
hence
it
was
doubtless
that
the
hebrew
word
which
is
translated
in
the
authorized
english
version
pillar
was
translated
in
the
vulgate
which
the
majority
of
christians
believe
virtually
inspired
by
the
word
statue
we
shall
find
this
fact
insisted
upon
by
theologians
arguing
in
behalf
of
the
statue
as
a
result
and
monument
of
the
miracle

fourteen

about

of

sixth
century
antoninus
martyr
visited
the
dead
sea
region
and
described
it
but
curiously
reversed
a
simple
truth
in
these
words
nor
do
sticks
or
straws
float
there
nor
can
a
man
swim
but
whatever
is
cast
into
it
sinks
to
the
bottom
as
to
the
statue
of
lot

he
threw
doubt
upon
its
miraculous
renewal
but
testified
that
it
was
still
standing
in
the
seventh
century
the
targum
of
jerusalem
not
only
testified
that
the
salt
pillar
at

must
retain

too
bishop
arculf
travelled
to
the
dead
sea
and
his
work
was
added
to

of
the

he
greatly
develops
the
legend
and
especially
that
part
of
it
given
by
josephus
the
bitumen
that
floats
upon
the

resembles

in
the
tenth
century
new
force
is
given
to
it
by
the
pious
moslem
mukadassi
speaking
of
the
town
of
segor
near
the
salt
region
he
says
that
the
proper
translation
of
its
name
is
hell
and
of
the
lake
he
says
its
waters
are
hot
even
as
though
the
place
stood
over
in
the
crusading
period
immediately
following
all
the
legends
burst
forth
more
brilliantly
than
ever
the
first
of
these
new
travellers
who
makes
careful
statements
is
fulk
of
chartres
who
in
accompanied
king
baldwin
to
the
dead
sea
and
saw
many
wonders
but
though
he
visited
the
salt
region
at
usdum
he
makes
no
mention
of
the
salt
pillar
evidently
he
had
fallen
on
evil
times
the
older
statues
had
probably
been
washed
away
and
no
new
one
had
happened
to
be
washed
out
of
the
rocks
just
at
that
period
but
his
misfortune
was
more
than
made
up
by
the
triumphant
experience
of
a
far
more
famous
traveller
half
a
century
later
rabbi
benjamin
of
tudela
rabbi
benjamin
finds
new
evidences
of
miracle
in
the
dead
sea
and
develops
to
a
still
higher
point
the
legend
of
the
salt
statue
of
wife
enriching
the
world
with
the
statement
that
it
was
steadily
and
miraculously
rene
wed
that
though
the
cattle
of
the
region
licked
its
surface
it
never
grew
smaller
again
a
thrill
of
joy
went
through
the
monasteries
and
pulpits
of
christendom
at
this
increasing
evidence
of
the
truth
of
scripture
toward
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
there
appeared
in
palestine
a
traveller
superior
to
most
before
or
since
count
burchard
monk
of
mount
sion
he
had
the
advantage
of
knowing
something
of
arabic
and
his
writings
show
him
to
have
been
observant
and
thoughtful
no
statue
of
lot
wife
appears
to
have
been
washed
clean
of
the
salt
rock
at
his
visit
but
he
takes
it
for
granted
that
the
dead
sea
is
the
mouth
of
hell
and
that
the
vapour
rising
from
it
is
the
smoke
from
furnaces
these
ideas
seem
to
have
become
part
of
the
common
stock
for
ernoul
who
travelled
to
the
dead
sea
during
the
same
century
always
speaks
of
it
as
the
sea
of
devils
near
the
beginning
of
the
fourteenth
century
appeared
the
book
of
far
wider
influence
which
bears
the
name
of
sir
john
mandeville
and
in
the
various
editions
of
it
myths
and
legends
of
the
dead
sea
and
of
the
pillar
of
salt
burst
forth
into
wonderful
luxuriance
this
book
tells
us
that
masses
of
fiery
matter
are
every
day
thrown
up
from
the
water
as
large
as
a
horse
that
though
it
contains
no
living
thing
it
has
been
shown
that
men
thrown
into
it
can
not
die
and
finally
as
if
to
prove
the
worthlessness
of
devout
testimony
to
the
miraculous
he
says
and
whoever
throws
a
piece
of
iron
therein
it
floats
and
whoever
throws
a
feather
therein
it
sinks
to
the
bottom
and
because
that
is
contrary
to
nature
i
was
not
willing
to
believe
it
until
i
saw
it
the
book
of
course
mentions
lot
wife
and
says
that
the
pillar
of
salt
stands
there
and
has
a
right
salty
taste
injustice
has
perhaps
been
done
to
the
compilers
of
this
famous
work
in
holding
them
liars
of
the
first
magnitude
they
simply
abhorred
scepticism
and
thought
it
meritorious
to
believe
all
pious
legends
the
ideal
mandeville
was
a
man
of
overmastering
faith
and
resembled
tertullian
in
believing
some
things
because
they
are
impossible
he
was
doubtless
entirely
conscientious
the
solemn
ending
of
the
book
shows
that
he
listened
observed
and
wrote
under
the
deepest
conviction
and
those
who
his
book
were
probably
just
as
honest
in
adding
the
later
stories
of
pious
travellers
the
travels
of
sir
john
mandeville
thus
appealing
to
the
popular
heart
were
most
widely
read
in
the
monasteries
and
repeated
among
the
people
innumerable
copies
were
made
in
manuscript
and
finally
in
print
and
so
the
old
myths
received
a
new
life

in

wonders
increased
in
we
have
the
lord
of
caumont
who
makes
a
pilgrimage
and
gives
us
a
statement
which
is
the
result
of
the
theological
reasoning
of
centuries
and
especially
interesting
as
a
typical
example
of
the
theological
method
in
contrast
with
the
scientific
he
could
not
understand
how
the
blessed
waters
of
the
jordan
could
be
allowed
to
mingle
with
the
accursed
waters
of
the
dead
sea
in
spite
then
of
the
eye
of
sense
he
beheld
the
water
with
the
eye
of
faith
and
calmly
announced
that
the
jordan
water
passes
through
the
sea
but
that
the
two
masses
of
water
are
not
mingled
as
to
the
salt
statue
of
lot
wife
he
declares
it
to
be
still
existing
and
copying
a
table
of
indulgences
granted
by
the
church
to
pious
pilgrims
he
puts
down
the
visit
to
the
salt
statue
as
giving
an
indulgence
of
seven
years
toward
the
end
of
the
century
we
have
another
traveller
yet
more
influential
bernard
of
breydenbach
dean
of
mainz
his
book
of
travels
was
published
in
at
the
famous
press
of
schoeffer
and
in
various
translations
it
was
spread
through
europe
exercising
an
influence
wide
and
deep
his
first
important
notice
of
the
dead
sea
is
as
follows
in
this
tirus
the
serpent
is
found
and
from
him
the
tiriac
medicine
is
made
he
is
blind
and
so
full
of
venom
that
there
is
no
remedy
for
his
bite
except
cutting
off
the
bitten
part
he
can
only
be
taken
by
striking
him
and
making
him
angry
then
his
venom
flies
into
his
head
and
tail
breydenbach
calls
the
dead
sea
the
chimney
of
hell
and
repeats
the
old
story
as
to
the
miraculous
solvent
for
its
bitumen
he
too
makes
the
statement
that
the
holy
water
of
the
jordan
does
not
mingle
with
the
accursed
water
of
the
infernal
sea
but
increases
the
miracle
which
caumont
had
announced
by
saying
that
although
the
waters
appear
to
come
together
the
jordan
is
really
absorbed
in
the
earth
before
it
reaches
the
sea
as
to
lot
wife
various
travellers
at
that
time
had
various
fortunes
some
like
caumont
and
breydenbach
took
her
continued
existence
for
granted
some
like
count
john
of
solms
saw
her
and
were
greatly
edified
some
like
hans
werli
tried
to
find
her
and
could
not
but
like
silvia
a
thousand
years
before
were
none
the
less
edified
by
the
idea
that
for
some
inscrutable
purpose
the
sea
had
been
allowed
to
hide
her
from
them
some
found
her
larger
than
they
expected
even
forty
feet
high
as
was
the
salt
pillar
which
happened
to
be
standing
at
the
visit
of
commander
lynch
in
but
this
only
added
a
new
proof
to
the
miracle
for
the
text
was
remembered
there
were
giants
in
those
days
out
of
the
mass
of
works
of
pilgrims
during
the
fifteenth
century
i
select
just
one
more
as
typical
of
the
theological
view
then
dominant
and
this
is
the
noted
book
of
felix
fabri
a
preaching
friar
of
ulm
i
select
him
because
even
so
eminent
an
authority
in
our
own
time
as
edward
robinson
declares
him
to
have
been
the
most
thorough
thoughtful
and
enlightened
traveller
of
that
century
fabri
is
greatly
impressed
by
the
wonders
of
the
dead
sea
and
typical
of
his
honesty
influenced
by
faith
is
his
account
of
the
dead
sea
fruit
he
describes
it
with
almost
perfect
accuracy
but
adds
the
statement
that
when
mature
it
is
filled
with
ashes
and
cinders
as
to
the
salt
statue
he
says
we
saw
the
place
between
the
sea
and
mount
segor
but
could
not
see
the
statue
itself
because
we
were
too
far
distant
to
see
anything
of
human
size
but
we
saw
it
with
firm
faith
because
we
believed
scripture
which
speaks
of
it
and
we
were
filled
with
wonder
to
sustain
absolute
faith
in
the
statue
he
reminds
his
reader
that
god
is
able
even
of
these
stones
to
raise
up
seed
to
abraham
and
goes
into
a
long
argument
discussing
such
transformations
as
those
of
king
atlas
and
pygmalion
statue
with
a
multitude
of
others
winding
up
with
the
case
given
in
the
miracles
of
jerome
of
a
heretic
who
was
changed
into
a
log
of
wood
which
was
then
burned
he
gives
a
statement
of
the
hebrews
that
lot
wife
received
her
peculiar
punishment
because
she
had
refused
to
add
salt
to
the
food
of
the
angels
when
they
visited
her
and
he
preaches
a
short
sermon
in
which
he
says
that
as
salt
is
the
condiment
of
food
so
the
salt
statue
of
lot
wife
gives
us
a
condiment
of
wisdom
for
bernard
of
breydenbach

there
were
indeed
many
discrepancies
in
the
testimony
of
travellers
regarding
the
salt
pillar
so
many
in
fact
that
at
a
later
period
the
learned
dom
calmet
acknowledged
that
they
shook
his
belief
in
the
whole
matter
but
during
this
earlier
time
under
the
complete
sway
of
the
theological
spirit
these
difficulties
only
gave
new
and
more
glorious
opportunities
for
faith
for
if
a
considerable
interval
occurred
between
the
washing
of
one
salt
pillar
out
of
existence
and
the
washing
of
another
into
existence
the
idea
arose
that
the
statue
by
virtue
of
the
soul
which
still
remained
in
it
had
departed
on
some
mysterious
excursion
did
it
happen
that
one
statue
was
washed
out
one
year
in
one
place
and
another
statue
another
year
in
another
place
this
difficulty
was
surmounted
by
believing
that
lot
wife
still
walked
about
did
it
happen
that
a
salt
column
was
undermined
by
the
rains
and
fell
this
was
believed
to
be
but
another
sign
of
life
did
a
pillar
happen
to
be
covered
in
part
by
the
sea
this
was
enough
to
arouse
the
belief
that
the
statue
from
time
to
time
descended
into
the
dead
sea
depths
possibly
to
satisfy
that
old
fatal
curiosity
regarding
her
former
neighbours
did
some
smaller
block
of
salt
happen
to
be
washed
out
near
the
statue
it
was
believed
that
a
household
dog
also
transformed
into
salt
had
followed
her
back
from
beneath
the
deep
did
more
statues
than
one
appear
at
one
time
that
simply
made
the
mystery
more
impressive
in
facts
now
so
easy
of
scientific
explanation
the
theologians
found
wonderful
matter
for
argument
one
great
question
among
them
was
whether
the
soul
of
lot
wife
did
really
remain
in
the
statue
on
one
side
it
was
insisted
that
as
holy
scripture
declares
that
lot
wife
was
changed
into
a
pillar
of
salt
and
as
she
was
necessarily
made
up
of
a
soul
and
a
body
the
soul
must
have
become
part
of
the
statue
this
argument
was
clinched
by
citing
that
passage
in
the
book
of
wisdom
in
which
the
salt
pillar
is
declared
to
be
still
standing
as
the
monument
of
an
unbelieving
soul
on
the
other
hand
it
was
insisted
that
the
soul
of
the
woman
must
have
been
incorporeal
and
immortal
and
hence
could
not
have
been
changed
into
a
substance
corporeal
and
mortal
naturally
to
this
it
would
be
answered
that
the
salt
pillar
was
no
more
corporeal
than
the
ordinary
materials
of
the
human
body
and
that
it
had
been
made
miraculously
immortal
and
with
god
all
things
are
possible
thus
were
opened
long
vistas
of
theological
discussion
for
a
brief
statement
of
the
main
arguments
for
and
against
the
idea
that
the
soul
of
lot
wife
remained
within
the
salt
statue
see
cornelius
a
lapide
commentarius
in
pentateuchum
antwerp
chap
xix
as
we
enter
the
sixteenth
century
the
dead
sea
myths
and
especially
the
legends
of
lot
wife
are
still
growing
in
father
anselm
of
the
minorites
declares
that
the
sea
sometimes
covers
the
feet
of
the
statue
sometimes
the
legs
sometimes
the
whole
body
in
gabriel
giraudet
priest
at
puy
journeyed
through
palestine
his
faith
was
robust
and
his
attitude
toward
the
myths
of
the
dead
sea
is
seen
by
his
declaration
that
its
waters
are
so
foul
that
one
can
smell
them
at
a
distance
of
three
leagues
that
straw
hay
or
feathers
thrown
into
them
will
sink
but
that
iron
and
other
metals
will
float
that
criminals
have
been
kept
in
them
three
or
four
days
and
could
not
drown
as
to
lot
wife
he
says
that
he
found
her
lying
there
her
back
toward
heaven
converted
into
salt
stone
for
i
touched
her
scratched
her
and
put
a
piece
of
her
into
my
mouth
and
she
tasted
salt
at
the
centre
of
all
these
legends
we
see
then
the
idea
that
though
there
were
no
living
beasts
in
the
dead
sea
the
people
of
the
overwhelmed
cities
were
still
living
beneath
its
waters
probably
in
hell
that
there
was
life
in
the
salt
statue
and
that
it
was
still
curious
regarding
its
old
neighbours
hence
such
travellers
in
the
latter
years
of
the
century
as
count
albert
of
lowenstein
and
prince
nicolas
radziwill
are
not
at
all
weakened
in
faith
by
failing
to
find
the
statue
what
the
former
is
capable
of
believing
is
seen
by
his
statement
that
in
a
certain
cemetery
at
cairo
during
one
night
in
the
year
the
dead
thrust
forth
their
feet
hands
limbs
and
even
rise
wholly
from
their
graves
there
seemed
then
no
limit
to
these
pious
beliefs
the
idea
that
there
is
merit
in
credulity
with
the
love
of
and
constantly
made
them
larger
nor
did
the
protestant
reformation
diminish
them
at
first
it
rather
strengthened
them
and
fixed
them
more
firmly
in
the
popular
mind
they
seemed
destined
to
last
forever
how
they
were
thus
strengthened
at
first
under
protestantism
and
how
they
were
finally
dissolved
away

the
atmosphere

culmination
of

of

the

of

legends
and
to
make

vouches
for
the
continued
existence
of

insisting
that

are
not
really
poured
into
the
infernal
basin
of
the
dead
sea
but
that
they
are

these
ideas
were
not
confined
to
the
people
at
large
we
trace
them
among
scholars
in

a
north
german
professor
and
theologian
published
his
itinerary
of

scripture
and
in
this
the
dead

legends
continue
to

tells
us
that
the
water
of
the
sea
changes
three
times

that
it
spits
forth
fire
that
it
throws
up
on

a
dutch
theologian
published
his
famous
work
on
sacred
geography
he
does
not
insist
upon
the
dead
sea
legends
generally
but
declares
that
the
statue
of
lot
wife
is
still
in
existence
and
on
his

he
gives
a
picture
of
her
standing
at

was
it
altogether
safe
to
dissent
from
such
beliefs

sound
in
the
faith
that
some
vestige
of
it
still
remains
and
makes
up
for
his
bit
of
freethinking
by
adding
a
new
mythical
horror
to
the
region

with

and

foul
odour
of

prevented

in
father
jean
boucher
publishes
the
first
of
many
editions
of
his
sacred
bouquet
of
the
holy
land
he
depicts
the
horrors
of
the
dead
sea
in
a
number
of
striking
antitheses
and
among
these
is
the
statement
that
it
is
made
of
mud
rather
than
of
water
that
it
soils
whatever
is
put
into
it
and
so
corrupts
the
land
about
it
that
not
a
blade
of
grass
grows
in
all
that
region
in
the
same
spirit
thirteen
years
later
the
protestant
christopher
heidmann
publishes
his
palaestina
in
which
he
speaks
of
a
fluid
resembling
blood
oozing
from
the
rocks
about
the
dead
sea
and
cites
authorities
to
prove
that
the
statue
of
lot
wife
still
exists
and
gives
signs
of
life
yet
as
we
near
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
some
evidences
of
a
healthful
and
fruitful
scepticism
begin
to
appear
the
old
stream
of
travellers
commentators
and
preachers
accepting
tradition
and
repeating
what
they
have
been
told
flows
on
but
here
and
there
we
are
refreshed
by
the
sight
of
a
man
who
really
begins
to
think
and
look
for
himself
first
among
these
is
the
french
naturalist
pierre
belon
as
regards
the
ordinary
wonders
he
had
the
simple
faith
of
his
time
among
a
multitude
of
similar
things
he
believed
that
he
saw
the
stones
on
which
the
disciples
were
sleeping
during
the
prayer
of
christ
the
stone
on
which
the
lord
sat
when
he
raised
lazarus
from
the
dead
the
lord
footprints
on
the
stone
from
which
he
ascended
into
heaven
and
most
curious
of
all
the
stone
which
the
builders
rejected
yet
he
makes
some
advance
on
his
predecessors
since
he
shows
in
one
passage
that
he
had
thought
out
the
process
by
which
the
simpler
myths
of
palestine
were
made
for
between
bethlehem
and
jerusalem
he
sees
a
field
covered
with
small
pebbles
and
of
these
he
says
the
common
people
tell
you
that
a
man
was
once
sowing
peas
there
when
our
lady
passed
that
way
and
asked
him
what
he
was
doing
the
man
answered
am
sowing
pebbles
and
straightway
all
the
peas
were
changed
into
these
little
stones
his
ascribing
belief
in
this
explanatory
transformation
myth
to
the
common
people
marks
the
faint
dawn
of
a
new
epoch
typical
also
of
this
new
class
is
the
german
botanist
leonhard
rauwolf
he
travels
through
palestine
in
and
though
devout
and
at
times
credulous
notes
comparatively
few
of
the
old
wonders
while
he
makes
thoughtful
and
careful
mention
of
things
in
nature
that
he
really
saw
he
declines
to
use
the
eyes
of
the
monks
and
steadily
uses
his
own
to
good
purpose
as
we
go
on
in
the
seventeenth
century
this
current
of
new
thought
is
yet
more
evident
a
habit
of
observing
more
carefully
and
of
comparing
observations
had
set
in
the
great
voyages
of
discovery
by
columbus
vasco
da
gama
magellan
and
others
were
producing
their
effect
and
this
effect
was
increased
by
the
inductive
philosophy
of
bacon
the
reasonings
of
descartes
and
the
suggestions
of
montaigne
so
evident
was
this
current
that
as
far
back
as
the
early
days
of
the
century
a
great
theologian
quaresmio
of
lodi
had
made
up
his
mind
to
stop
it
forever
in
therefore
he
began
his
ponderous
work
entitled
the
historical
theological
and
moral
explanation
of
the
holy
land
he
laboured
upon
it
for
nine
years
gave
nine
years
more
to
perfecting
it
and
then
put
it
into
the
hands
of
the
great
publishing
house
of
plantin
at
antwerp
they
were
four
years
in
printing
and
correcting
it
and
when
it
at
last
appeared
it
seemed
certain
to
establish
the
theological
view
of
the
holy
land
for
all
time
while
taking
abundant
care
of
other
myths
which
he
believed
sanctified
by
holy
scripture
quaresmio
devoted
himself
at
great
length
to
the
dead
sea
but
above
all
to
the
salt
statue
and
he
divides
his
chapter
on
it
into
three
parts
each
headed
by
a
question
first
how
was
wife
changed
into
a
statue
of
salt
secondly
where
was
she
thus
transformed
and
thirdly
does
that
statue
still
exist
through
each
of
these
divisions
he
fights
to
the
end
all
who
are
inclined
to
swerve
in
the
slightest
degree
from
the
orthodox
opinion
he
utterly
refuses
to
compromise
with
any
modern
theorists
to
all
such
he
says
the
narration
of
moses
is
historical
and
is
to
be
received
in
its
natural
sense
and
no
man
will
deny
this
to
those
who
favoured
the
figurative
interpretation
he
says
with
such
reasonings
any
passage
of
scripture
can
be
denied
as
to
the
spot
where
the
miracle
occurred
he
discusses
four
places
but
settles
upon
the
point
where
the
picture
of
the
statue
is
given
in
adrichom
map
as
to
the
continued
existence
of
the
statue
he
plays
with
the
opposing
view
as
a
cat
fondles
a
mouse
and
then
shows
that
the
most
revered
ancient
authorities
venerable
men
still
living
and
the
bedouins
all
agree
that
it
is
still
in
being
throughout
the
whole
chapter
his
thoroughness
in
scriptural
knowledge
and
his
profundity
in
logic
are
only
excelled
by
his
scorn
for
those
theologians
who
were
willing
to
yield
anything
to
rationalism
so
powerful
was
this
argument
that
it
seemed
to
carry
everything
before
it
not
merely
throughout
the
roman
obedience
but
among
the
most
eminent
theologians
of
protestantism
as
regards
the
roman
church
we
may
take
as
a
type
the
missionary
priest
eugene
roger
who
shortly
after
the
appearance
of
quaresmio
book
published
his
own
travels
in
palestine
he
was
an
observant
man
and
his
work
counts
among
those
of
real
value
but
the
spirit
of
quaresmio
had
taken
possession
of
him
fully
his
work
is
prefaced
with
a
map
showing
the
points
of
most
importance
in
scriptural
history
and
among
these
he
identifies
the
place
where
samson
slew
the
thousand
philistines
with
the
jawbone
of
an
ass
and
where
he
hid
the
gates
of
gaza
the
cavern
which
adam
and
eve
inhabited
after
their
expulsion
from
paradise
the
spot
where
balaam
ass
spoke
the
tree
on
which
absalom
was
hanged
the
place
where
jacob
wrestled
with
the
angel
the
steep
place
where
the
swine
possessed
of
devils
plunged
into
the
sea
the
spot
where
the
prophet
elijah
was
taken
up
in
a
chariot
of
fire
and
of
course
the
position
of
the
salt
statue
which
was
once
lot
wife
he
not
only
indicates
places
on
land
but
places
in
the
sea
thus
he
shows
where
jonah
was
swallowed
by
the
whale
and
where
peter
caught
one
hundred
and
fishes
as
to
the
dead
sea
miracles
generally
he
does
not
dwell
on
them
at
great
length
he
evidently
felt
that
quaresmio
had
exhausted
the
subject
but
he
shows
largely
the
fruits
of
quaresmio
teaching
in
other
matters
so
too
we
find
the
thoughts
and
words
of
quaresmio
echoing
afar
through
the
german
universities
in
public
disquisitions
dissertations
and
sermons
the
great
bible
commentators
both
catholic
and
protestant
generally
agreed
in
accepting
them
but
strong
as
this
theological
theory
was
we
find
that
as
time
went
on
it
required
to
be
braced
somewhat
and
in
wedelius
professor
of
medicine
at
jena
chose
as
the
subject
of
his
inaugural
address
the
physiology
of
the
destruction
of
sodom
and
of
the
statue
of
salt
it
is
a
masterly
example
of
sanctified
science
at
great
length
he
dwells
on
the
characteristics
of
sulphur
salt
and
thunderbolts
mixes
up
scriptural
texts
theology
and
chemistry
after
a
most
bewildering
fashion
and
finally
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
a
thunderbolt
flung
by
the
almighty
calcined
the
body
of
lot
wife
and
at
the
same
time
vitrified
its
particles
into
a
glassy
mass

not
only
were
these
views
demonstrated
so
far
as
reasoning
could
demonstrate
anything
but
it
was
clearly
shown
by
a
continuous
chain
of
testimony
from
the
earliest
ages
that
the
salt
statue
at
usdum
had
been
recognised
as
the
body
of
lot
wife
by
jews
mohammedans
and
the
universal
christian
church
always
everywhere
and
by
all
under
the
influence
of
teachings
like
these
and
of
the
winter
rains
new
wonders
began
to
appear
at
the
salt
pillar
in
the
franciscan
monk
zwinner
published
his
travels
in
palestine
and
gave
not
only
most
of
the
old
myths
regarding
the
salt
statue
but
a
new
one
in
some
respects
more
striking
than
any
of
the
old
for
he
had
heard
that
a
dog
also
transformed
into
salt
was
standing
by
the
side
of
lot
wife
even
the
more
solid
benedictine
scholars
were
carried
away
and
we
find
in
the
sacred
history
by
mezger
of
the
order
of
benedict
published
in
a
renewal
of
the
declaration
that
the
salt
statue
must
be
a
perpetual
memorial
but
it
was
soon
evident
that
the
scientific
current
was
still
working
beneath
this
ponderous
mass
of
theological
authority
a
typical
evidence
of
this
we
find
in
in
the
travels
of
doubdan
a
canon
of
denis
as
to
the
dead
sea
he
says
that
he
saw
no
smoke
no
clouds
and
no
black
sticky
water
as
to
the
statue
of
lot
wife
he
says
the
moderns
do
not
believe
so
easily
that
she
has
lasted
so
long
then
as
if
alarmed
at
his
own
boldness
he
concedes
that
the
sea
may
be
black
and
sticky
in
the
middle
and
from
lot
wife
he
escapes
under
cover
of
some
pious
generalities
four
years
later
another
french
ecclesiastic
jacques
goujon
referring
in
his
published
travels
to
the
legends
of
the
salt
pillar
says
people
may
believe
these
stories
as
much
as
they
choose
i
did
not
see
it
nor
did
i
go
there
so
too
in
morison
a
dignitary
of
the
french
church
having
travelled
in
palestine
confesses
that
as
to
the
story
of
the
pillar
of
salt
he
has
difficulty
in
believing
it
the
same
current
is
observed
working
still
more
strongly
in
the
travels
of
the
rev
henry
maundrell
an
english
chaplain
at
aleppo
who
travelled
through
palestine
during
the
same
year
he
pours
contempt
over
the
legends
of
the
dead
sea
in
general
as
to
the
story
that
birds
could
not
fly
over
it
he
says
that
he
saw
them
flying
there
as
to
the
utter
absence
of
life
in
the
sea
he
saw
small
shells
in
it
he
saw
no
traces
of
any
buried
cities
and
as
to
the
stories
regarding
the
statue
of
lot
wife
and
the
proposal
to
visit
it
he
says
nor
could
we
give
faith
enough
to
these
reports
to
induce
us
to
go
on
such
an
errand
the
influence
of
the
baconian
philosophy
on
his
mind
is
very
clear
for
in
expressing
his
disbelief
in
the
dead
sea
apples
with
their
contents
of
ashes
he
says
that
he
saw
none
and
he
cites
lord
bacon
in
support
of
scepticism
on
this
and
similar
points
but
the
strongest
effect
of
this
growing
scepticism
is
seen
near
the
end
of
that
century
when
the
eminent
dutch
commentator
clericus
le
clerc
published
his
commentary
on
the
pentateuch
and
his
dissertation
on
the
statue
of
salt
at
great
length
he
brings
all
his
shrewdness
and
learning
to
bear
against
the
whole
legend
of
the
actual
transformation
of
lot
wife
and
the
existence
of
the
salt
pillar
and
ends
by
saying
that
the
whole
story
is
due
to
the
vanity
of
some
and
the
credulity
of
more
in
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
we
find
new
tributaries
to
this
rivulet
of
scientific
thought
in
father
felix
beaugrand
dismisses
the
dead
sea
legends
and
the
salt
statue
very
curtly
and
dryly
expressing
not
his
belief
in
it
but
a
conventional
wish
to
believe
in
a
scholar
appeared
in
another
part
of
europe
and
of
different
faith
who
did
far
more
than
any
of
his
predecessors
to
envelop
the
dead
sea
legends
in
an
atmosphere

truth
adrian
reland
professor

university
of
utrecht
his
work
on
palestine
is
a
monument
of
patient
scholarship
having
as
its
nucleus
a
love
of
truth
as
truth
there
is
no
irreverence
in
him
but
he
quietly
brushes
away
a
great
mass
of
myths
and
legends
as
to
the
statue
of
lot
wife
he
treats
it
warily
but
applies
the
comparative
method
to
it
with
killing
effect
by
showing
that
the
story
of
its
miraculous
renewal
is
but
one

yet
to
superficial
observers
the
old
current
of
myth
and
marvel
seemed
to
flow
into
the
eighteenth
century
as
strong
as
ever
and
of
this
we
may
take
two
typical
evidences
the
first
of
these
is
the
pious
pilgrimage
of
vincent
briemle
his
journey
was
made
about
and
his
work
brought
out
under
the
auspices
of
a
high
papal
functionary
some
years
later
in
a
heavy
quarto
gave
new
life
to
the
stories
of
the
hellish
character
of
the
dead
sea
and
especially
to
the
miraculous
renewal
of
the
salt
statue
in
came
a
still
more
striking
effort
to
maintain
the
old
belief
in
the
north
of
europe
for
in
that
year
the
eminent
theologian
masius
published
his
great
treatise
on
the
conversion
of
lot
wife
into
a
statue
of
salt
evidently
intending
that
this
work
should
be
the
last
word
on
this
subject
in
germany
as
quaresmio
had
imagined
that
his
work
would
be
the
last
in
italy
he
develops
his
subject
after
the
high
scholastic
and
theologic
manner
calling
attention
first
to
the
divine
command
in
the
new
testament
remember
lot
wife
he
argues
through
a
long
series
of
chapters
in
the
ninth
of
these
he
discusses
the
impelling
cause
of
her
looking
back
and
introduces
us
to
the
question
formerly
so
often
treated
by
theologians
whether
the
soul
of
lot
wife
was
finally
saved
here
we
are
glad
to
learn
that
the
big
warm
heart
of
luther
lifted
him
above
the
common
herd
of
theologians
and
led
him
to
declare
that
she
was
a
faithful
and
saintly
woman
and
that
she
certainly
was
not
eternally
damned
in
justice
to
the
roman
church
also
it
should
be
said
that
several
of
her
most
eminent
commentators
took
a
similar
view
and
insisted
that
the
sin
of
lot
wife
was
venial
and
therefore
at
the
worst
could
only
subject
her
to
the
fires
of
purgatory
the
eleventh
chapter
discusses
at
length
the
question
how
she
was
converted
into
salt
and
mentioning
many
theological
opinions
dwells
especially
upon
the
view
of
rivetus
that
a
thunderbolt
made
up
apparently
of
fire
sulphur
and
salt
wrought
her
transformation
at
the
same
time
that
it
blasted
the
land
and
he
bases
this
opinion
upon
the
chapter
of
deuteronomy
and
the
one
hundred
and
seventh
psalm
later
masius
presents
a
sacred
scientific
theory
that
saline
particles
entered
into
her
until
her
whole
body
was
infected
and
with
this
he
connects
another
piece
of
sanctified
science
to
the
effect
that
stagnant
bile
may
have
rendered
the
surface
of
her
body
entirely
shining
bitter
dry
and
deformed
finally
he
comes
to
the
great
question
whether
the
salt
pillar
is
still
in
existence
on
this
he
is
full
and
fair
on
one
hand
he
allows
that
luther
thought
that
it
was
involved
in
the
general
destruction
of
sodom
and
gomorrah
and
he
cites
various
travellers
who
had
failed
to
find
it
but
on
the
other
hand
he
gives
a
long
chain
of
evidence
to
show
that
it
continued
to
exist
very
wisely
he
reminds
the
reader
that
the
positive
testimony
of
those
who
have
seen
it
must
outweigh
the
negative
testimony
of
those
who
have
not
and
he
finally
decides
that
the
salt
statue
is
still
in
being
no
doubt
a
work
like
this
produced
a
considerable
effect
in
protestant
countries
indeed
this
effect
seems
evident
as
far
off
as
england
for
in
we
find
in
dean
prideaux
old
and
new
testament
connected
a
map
on
which
the
statue
of
salt
is
carefully
indicated
so
too
in
holland
in
the
sacred
geography
published
at
utrecht
in
by
the
theologian
bachiene
we
find
him
while
showing
many
signs
of
rationalism
evidently
inclined
to
the
old
views
as
to
the
existence
of
the
salt
pillar
but
just
here
comes
a
curious
evidence
of
the
real
direction
of
the
current
of
thought
through
the
century
for
nine
years
later
in
the
german
translation
of
bachiene
work
we
find
copious
notes
by
the
translator
in
a
far
more
rationalistic
spirit
indeed
we
see
the
dawn
of
the
inevitable
day
of
compromise
for
we
now
have
instead
of
the
old
argument
that
the
divine
power
by
one
miraculous
act
changed
lot
wife
into
a
salt
pillar
the
suggestion
that
she
was
caught
in
a
shower
of
sulphur
and
saltpetre
covered
by
it
and
that
the
result
was
a
lump
which
in
a
general
way
is
called
in
our
sacred
books
a
pillar
of
salt

and

but
from
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
new
current
sets
through
christendom
with
strength
very
interesting
is
it
to
compare
the
great
scriptural
commentaries
of
the
middle
of
this
century
with
those
published
a
century
earlier
of
the
earlier
ones
we
may
take
matthew
poole
synopsis
as
a
type
as
authorized
by
royal
decree
in
it
contains
very
substantial
arguments
for
the
pious
belief
in
the
statue
of
the
later
ones
we
may
take
the
edition
of
the
noted
commentary
of
the
jesuit
tirinus
seventy
years
later
while
he
feels
bound
to
present
the
authorities
he
evidently
endeavours
to
get
rid
of
the
subject
as
speedily
as
possible
under
cover
of
conventionalities
of
the
spirit
of
quaresmio
he
shows
no
trace
for
poole
polus
see
his
synopsis
and
for
titinus
the
lyons
edition
of
his
commentary
about
came
a
striking
evidence
of
the
strength
of
this
new
current
the
abate
mariti
then
published
his
book
upon
the
holy
land
and
of
this
book
by
an
italian
ecclesiastic
the
most
eminent
of
german
bibliographers
in
this
field
says
that
it
first
broke
a
path
for
critical
study
of
the
holy
land
mariti
is
entirely
sceptical
as
to
the
sinking
of
the
valley
of
siddim
and
the
overwhelming
of
the
cities
he
speaks
kindly
of
a
capuchin
father
who
saw
everywhere
at
the
dead
sea
traces
of
the
divine
malediction
while
he
himself
could
not
see
them
and
says
it
is
because
a
capuchin
carries
everywhere
the
five
senses
of
faith
while
i
only
carry
those
of
nature
he
speaks
of
the
lies
of
josephus
and
makes
merry
over
the
rude
and
shapeless
block
which
the
guide
assured
him
was
the
statue
of
lot
wife
explaining
the
want
of
human
form
in
the
salt
pillar
by
telling
him
that
this
complete
metamorphosis
was
part
of
her
punishment
about
twenty
years
later
another
remarkable
man
volney
broaches
the
subject
in
what
was
then
known
as
the
philosophic
spirit
between
the
years
and
he
made
an
extensive
journey
through
the
holy
land
and
published
a
volume
of
travels
which
by
acuteness
of
thought
and
vigour
of
style
secured
general
attention
in
these
myth
and
legend
were
thrown
aside
and
we
have
an
account
simply
dictated
by
the
love
of
truth
as
truth
he
too
keeps
the
torch
of
science
burning
by
applying
his
geological
knowledge
to
the
regions
which
he
traverses
as
we
look
back
over
the
eighteenth
century
we
see
mingled
with
the
new
current
of
thought
and
strengthening
it
a
constantly
increasing
stream
of
more
strictly
scientific
observation
and
reflection
to
review
it
briefly
in
the
very
first
years
of
the
century
maraldi
showed
the
paris
academy
of
sciences
fossil
fishes
found
in
the
lebanon
region
a
little
later
cornelius
bruyn
in
the
french
edition
of
his
eastern
travels
gave
representations
of
fossil
fishes
and
shells
some
of
them
from
the
region
of
the
dead
sea
about
the
middle
of
the
century
richard
pococke
bishop
of
meath
and
korte
of
altona
made
more
statements
of
the
same
sort
and
toward
the
close
of
the
century
as
we
have
seen
volney
gave
still
more
of
these
researches
with
philosophical
deductions
from
them
the
result
of
all
this
was
that
there
gradually
dawned
upon
thinking
men
the
conviction
that
for
ages
before
the
appearance
of
man
on
the
planet
and
during
all
the
period
since
his
appearance
natural
laws
have
been
steadily
in
force
in
palestine
as
elsewhere
this
conviction
obliged
men
to
consider
other
than
supernatural
causes
for
the
phenomena
of
the
dead
sea
and
myth
and
marvel
steadily
shrank
in
value
but
at
the
very
threshold
of
the
nineteenth
century
chateaubriand
came
into
the
field
and
he
seemed
to
banish
the
scientific
spirit
though
what
he
really
did
was
to
conceal
it
temporarily
behind
the
vapours
of
his
rhetoric
the
time
was
propitious
for
him
it
was
the
period
of
reaction
after
the
french
revolution
when
what
was
called
religion
was
again
in
fashion
and
when
even
atheists
supported
it
as
a
good
thing
for
common
people
of
such
an
epoch
chateaubriand
with
his
superficial
information
thin
sentiment
and
showy
verbiage
was
the
foreordained
prophet
his
enemies
were
wont
to
deny
that
he
ever
saw
the
holy
land
whether
he
did
or
not
he
added
nothing
to
real
knowledge
but
simply
threw
a
momentary
glamour
over
the
regions
he
described
and
especially
over
the
dead
sea
the
legend
of
lot
wife
he
carefully
avoided
for
he
knew
too
well
the
danger
of
ridicule
in
france
as
long
as
the
napoleonic
and
bourbon
reigns
lasted
and
indeed
for
some
time
afterward
this
kind
of
dealing
with
the
holy
land
was
fashionable
and
we
have
a
long
series
of
men
especially
of
frenchmen
who
evidently
received
their
impulse
from
chateaubriand
about
de
geramb
abbot
of
la
trappe
evidently
a
very
noble
and
devout
spirit
sees
vapour
above
the
dead
sea
but
stretches
the
truth
a
little
speaking
of
it
as
vapour
or
smoke
he
could
not
find
the
salt
statue
and
complains
of
the
diversity
of
stories
regarding
it
the
simple
physical
cause
of
this
diversity
the
washing
out
of
different
statues
in
different
years
never
occurs
to
him
but
he
comforts
himself
with
the
scriptural
warrant
for
the
metamorphosis
for
mariti

but
to
the
honour
of
scientific
men
and
scientific
truth
it
should
be
said
that
even
under
napoleon
and
the
bourbons
there
were
men
who
continued
to
explore
observe
and
describe
with
the
simple
love
of
truth
as
truth
and
in
spite
of
the
probability
that
their
researches
would
be
received
during
their
lifetime
with
contempt
and
even
hostility
both
in
church
and
state
the
pioneer
in
this
work
of
the
nineteenth
century
was
the
german
naturalist
ulrich
seetzen
he
began
his
main
investigation
in
and
soon
his
learning
courage
and
honesty
threw
a
flood
of
new
light
into
the
dead
sea
questions
in
this
light
myth
and
legend
faded
more
rapidly
than
ever
typical
of
his
method
is
his
examination
of
the
dead
sea
fruit
he
found
on
reaching
palestine
that
josephus
story
regarding
it
which
had
been
accepted
for
nearly
two
thousand
years
was
believed
on
all
sides
more
than
this
he
found
that
the
original
myth
had
so
grown
that
a
multitude
of
respectable
people
at
bethlehem
and
elsewhere
assured
him
that
not
only
apples
but
pears
pomegranates
figs
lemons
and
many
other
fruits
which
grow
upon
the
shores
of
the
dead
sea
though
beautiful
to
look
upon
were
filled
with
ashes
these
good
people
declared
to
seetzen
that
they
had
seen
these
fruits
and
that
not
long
before
a
basketful
of
them
which
had
been
sent
to
a
merchant
of
jaffa
had
turned
to
ashes
seetzen
was
evidently
perplexed
by
this
mass
of
testimony
and
naturally
anxious
to
examine
these
fruits
on
arriving
at
the
sea
he
began
to
look
for
them
and
the
guide
soon
showed
him
the
apples
these
he
found
to
be
simply
an
asclepia
which
had
been
described
by
linnaeus
and
which
is
found
in
the
east
indies
arabia
egypt
jamaica
and
elsewhere
the
ashes
being
simply
seeds
he
looked
next
for
the
other
fruits
and
the
guide
soon
found
for
him
the
lemons
these
he
discovered
to
be
a
species
of
solanum
found
in
other
parts
of
palestine
and
elsewhere
and
the
seeds
in
these
were
the
famous
cinders
he
looked
next
for
the
pears
figs
and
other
accursed
fruits
but
instead
of
finding
them
filled
with
ashes
and
cinders
he
found
them
like
the
same
fruits
in
other
lands
and
he
tells
us
that
he
ate
the
figs
with
much
pleasure
so
perished
a
myth
which
had
been
kept
alive
two
thousand
years
partly
by
modes
of
thought
natural
to
theologians
partly
by
the
of
guides
and
partly
by
the
love
of
among
travellers
the
other
myths
fared
no
better
as
to
the
appearance
of
the
sea
he
found
its
waters
not
black
and
sticky
but
blue
and
transparent
he
found
no
smoke
rising
from
the
abyss
but
tells
us
that
sunlight
and
cloud
and
shore
were
pleasantly
reflected
from
the
surface
as
to
wife
he
found
no
salt
pillar
which
had
been
a
careless
woman
but
the
arabs
showed
him
many
boulders
which
had
once
been
wicked
men
his
work
was
worthily
continued
by
a
long
succession
of
true
investigators
among
them
such
travellers
or
geographers
as
burckhardt
irby
mangles
fallmerayer
and
carl
von
raumer
by
men
like
these
the
atmosphere
of
myth
and
legend
was
steadily
cleared
away
as
a
rule
they
simply
forgot
lot
wife
altogether
in
this
noble
succession
should
be
mentioned
an
american
theologian
edward
robinson
professor
at
new
york
beginning
about
he
devoted
himself
for
thirty
years
to
the
thorough
study
of
the
geography
of
palestine
and
he
found
a
worthy
coadjutor
in
another
american
divine
eli
smith
neither
of
these
men
departed
openly
from
the
old
traditions
that
would
have
cost
a
price
the
loss
of
all
further
opportunity
to
carry
on
their
researches
robinson
did
not
even
think
it
best
to
call
attention
to
the
mythical
character
of
much
on
which
his
predecessors
had
insisted
he
simply
brought
in
more
and
more
the
dry
clear
atmosphere
of
the
love
of
truth
for
truth
sake
and
in
this
myths
and
legends
steadily
disappeared
by
doing
this
he
rendered
a
far
greater
service
to
real
christianity
than
any
other
theologian
had
ever
done
in
this
field
very
characteristic
is
his
dealing
with
the
myth
of
lot
wife
though
more
than
once
at
usdum
though
giving
valuable
information
regarding
the
sea
shore
and
mountains
there
he
carefully
avoids
all
mention
of
the
salt
pillar
and
of
the
legend
which
arose
from
it
in
this
he
set
an
example
followed
by
most
of
the
more
thoughtful
religious
travellers
since
his
time
very
significant
is
it
to
see
the
new
testament
injunction
remember
lot
wife
so
utterly
forgotten
these
later
investigators
seem
never
to
have
heard
of
it
and
this
constant
forgetfulness
shows
the
change
which
had
taken
place
in
the
enlightened
thinking
of
the
world
but
in
the
year
came
an
episode
very
striking
in
its
character
and
effect
at
that
time
the
war
between
the
united
states
and
mexico
having
closed
lieutenant
lynch
of
the
united
states
navy
found
himself
in
the
port
of
vera
cruz
commanding
an
old
hulk
the
supply
looking
about
for
something
to
do
it
occurred
to
him
to
write
to
the
secretary
of
the
navy
asking
permission
to
explore
the
dead
sea
under
ordinary
circumstances
the
proposal
would
doubtless
have
been
strangled
with
red
tape
but
fortunately
the
secretary
at
that
time
was
john
mason
of
virginia
mason
was
famous
for
his
good
nature
both
at
washington
and
at
paris
where
he
was
afterward
minister
this
predominant
trait
has
left
a
multitude
of
amusing
traditions
it
was
of
him
that
senator
benton
said
to
be
supremely
happy
he
must
have
his
paunch
full
of
oysters
and
his
hands
full
of
cards
the
secretary
granted
permission
but
evidently
gave
the
matter
not
another
thought
as
a
result
came
an
expedition
the
most
comical
and
one
of
the
most
rich
in
results
to
be
found
in
american
annals
never
was
anything
so
lieutenant
lynch
started
with
his
hulk
with
hardly
an
instrument
save
those
ordinarily
found
on
shipboard
and
with
a
body
of
men
probably
the
most
unfit
for
anything
like
scientific
investigation
ever
sent
on
such
an
errand
fortunately
he
picked
up
a
young
instructor
in
mathematics
anderson
and
added
to
his
apparatus
two
strong
iron
boats
arriving
after
a
tedious
voyage
on
the
coast
of
asia
minor
he
set
to
work
he
had
no
adequate
preparation
in
general
history
archaeology
or
the
physical
sciences
but
he
had
his
american
patriotism
energy
pluck
pride
and
devotion
to
duty
and
these
qualities
stood
him
in
good
stead
with
great
labour
he
got
the
iron
boats
across
the
country
then
the
tug
of
war
began
first
of
all
investigators
he
forced
his
way
through
the
whole
length
of
the
river
jordan
and
from
end
to
end
of
the
dead
sea
there
were
constant
difficulties
geographical
climatic
and
personal
but
lynch
cut
through
them
all
he
was
brave
or
shrewd
as
there
was
need
anderson
proved
an
admirable
helper
and
together
they
made
surveys
of
distances
altitudes
depths
and
sundry
simple
investigations
in
a
geological
mineralogical
and
chemical
way
much
was
poorly
done
much
was
left
undone
but
the
general
result
was
most
honourable
both
to
lynch
and
anderson
and
secretary
mason
found
that
his
patronage
of
the
enterprise
was
the
best
act
of
his
official
life
the
results
of
this
expedition
on
public
opinion
were
most
curious
lynch
was
no
scholar
in
any
sense
he
had
travelled
little
and
thought
less
on
the
real
questions
underlying
the
whole
investigation
as
to
the
difference
in
depth
of
the
two
parts
of
the
lake
he
jumped
with
a
sailor
disregard
of
logic
to
the
conclusion
that
it
somehow
proved
the
mythical
account
of
the
overwhelming
of
the
cities
and
he
indulged
in
reflections
of
a
sort
probably
suggested
by
his
recollections
of
american
especially
noteworthy
is
his
treatment
of
the
legend
of
lot
wife
he
found
the
pillar
of
salt
it
happened
to
be
at
that
period
a
circular
column
of
friable
salt
rock
about
forty
feet
high
yet
while
he
accepts
every
other
old
myth
he
treats
the
belief
that
this
was
once
the
wife
of
lot
as
a
superstition
one
little
circumstance
added
enormously
to
the
influence
of
this
book
for
as
a
frontispiece
he
inserted
a
picture
of
the
salt
column
it
was
delineated
in
rather
a
poetic
manner
light
streamed
upon
it
heavy
clouds
hung
above
it
and
as
a
background
were
ranged
buttresses
of
salt
rock
furrowed
and
channelled
out
by
the
winter
rains
this
salt
statue
picture
was
spread
far
and
wide
and
in
thousands
of
country
pulpits
and
it
was
shown
as
a
tribute
of
science
to
scripture
nor
was
this
influence
confined
to
american
children
lynch
had
innocently
set
a
trap
into
which
several
european
theologians
stumbled
one
of
these
was
lorenz
gratz
of
augsburg
a
theological
professor
in
the
second
edition
of
his
theatre
of
the
holy
scriptures
published
in
he
hails
lynch
discovery
of
the
salt
pillar
with
joy
forgets
his
allusion
to
the
old
theory
regarding
it
as
a
superstition
and
does
not
stop
to
learn
that
this
was
one
of
a
succession
of
statues
washed
out
yearly
by
the
rains
but
accepts
it
as
the
original
lot
wife
the
french
churchmen
suffered
most
about
two
years
after
lynch
de
saulcy
visited
the
dead
sea
to
explore
it
thoroughly
evidently
in
the
interest
of
sacred
science
and
of
his
own
promotion
of
the
modest
thoroughness
of
robinson
there
is
no
trace
in
his
writings
he
promptly
discovered
the
overwhelmed
cities
which
no
one
before
or
since
has
ever
found
poured
contempt
on
other
investigators
and
threw
over
his
whole
work
an
air
of
piety
but
unfortunately
having
a
frenchman
dread
of
ridicule
he
attempted
to
give
a
rationalistic
explanation
of
what
he
calls
the
enormous
needles
of
salt
washed
out
by
the
winter
rain
and
their
connection
with
the
lot
wife
myth
and
declared
his
firm
belief
that
she
being
delayed
by
curiosity
or
terror
was
crushed
by
a
rock
which
rolled
down
from
the
mountain
and
when
lot
and
his
children
turned
about
they
saw
at
the
place
where
she
had
been
only
the
rock
of
salt
which
covered
her
body
but
this
would
not
do
at
all
and
an
eminent
ecclesiastic
privately
and
publicly
expostulated
with
de
saulcy
very
naturally
declaring
that
it
was
not
lot
who
wrote
the
book
of
genesis
the
result
was
that
another
edition
of
de
saulcy
work
was
published
by
a
church
book
society
with
the
offending
passage
omitted
but
a
passage
was
retained
really
far
more
suggestive
of
heterodoxy
and
this
was
an
arab
legend
accounting
for
the
origin
of
certain
rocks
near
the
dead
sea
curiously
resembling
salt
formations
this
in
effect
ran
as
follows
abraham
the
friend
of
god
having
come
here
one
day
with
his
mule
to
buy
salt
the
impudently
told
him
that
they
had
no
salt
to
sell
whereupon
the
patriarch
said
words
are
true
you
have
no
salt
to
sell
and
instantly
the
salt
of
this
whole
region
was
transformed
into
stone
or
rather
into
a
salt
which
has
lost
its
savour
nothing
could
be
more
sure
than
this
story
to
throw
light
into
the
mental
and
moral
process
by
which
the
salt
pillar
myth
was
originally
created
in
the
years
and
came
an
expedition
on
a
much
more
imposing
scale
that
of
the
duc
de
luynes
his
knowledge
of
archaeology
and
his
wealth
were
freely
devoted
to
working
the
mine
which
lynch
had
opened
and
taking
with
him
an
iron
vessel
and
several
savants
he
devoted
himself
especially
to
finding
the
cities
of
the
dead
sea
and
to
giving
less
vague
accounts
of
them
than
those
of
de
saulcy
but
he
was
disappointed
and
honest
enough
to
confess
his
disappointment
so
vanished
one
of
the
most
cherished
parts
of
the
legend
but
worse
remained
behind
in
the
orthodox
duke
company
was
an
acute
geologist
monsieur
lartet
who
in
due
time
made
an
elaborate
report
which
let
a
flood
of
light
into
the
whole
region
the
abbe
richard
had
been
rejoicing
the
orthodox
heart
of
france
by
exhibiting
some
prehistoric
flint
implements
as
the
knives
which
joshua
had
made
for
circumcision
by
a
truthful
statement
monsieur
lartet
set
all
france
laughing
at
the
abbe
and
then
turned
to
the
geology
of
the
dead
sea
basin
while
he
conceded
that
man
may
have
seen
some
volcanic
crisis
there
and
may
have
preserved
a
vivid
remembrance
of
the
vapour
then
rising
his
whole
argument
showed
irresistibly
that
all
the
phenomena
of
the
region
are
due
to
natural
causes
and
that
so
far
from
a
sudden
rising
of
the
lake
above
the
valley
within
historic
times
it
has
been
for
ages
steadily
subsiding
since
balaam
was
called
by
balak
to
curse
his
enemies
and
blessed
them
altogether
there
has
never
been
a
more
unexpected
tribute
to
truth
even
the
salt
pillar
at
usdum
as
depicted
in
lynch
book
aided
to
undermine
the
myth
among
thinking
men
for
the
background
of
the
picture
showed
other
pillars
of
salt
in
process
of
formation
and
the
ultimate
result
of
all
these
expeditions
was
to
spread
an
atmosphere
in
which
myth
and
legend
became
more
and
more
attenuated
to
sum
up
the
main
points
in
this
work
of
the
nineteenth
century
seetzen
robinson
and
others
had
found
that
a
human
being
could
traverse
the
lake
without
being
killed
by
hellish
smoke
that
the
waters
gave
forth
no
odours
that
the
fruits
of
the
region
were
not
created
full
of
cinders
to
match
the
desolation
of
the
dead
sea
but
were
growths
not
uncommon
in
asia
minor
and
elsewhere
in
fact
that
all
the
phenomena
were
due
to
natural
causes
ritter
and
others
had
shown
that
all
noted
features
of
the
dead
sea
and
the
surrounding
country
were
to
be
found
in
various
other
lakes
and
regions
to
which
no
supernatural
cause
was
ascribed
among
enlightened
men
lynch
van
de
velde
osborne
and
others
had
revealed
the
fact
that
the
pillar
of
salt
was
frequently
formed
anew
by
the
rains
and
lartet
and
other
geologists
had
given
a
final
blow
to
the
myths
by
making
it
clear
from
the
markings
on
the
neighbouring
rocks
that
instead
of
a
sudden
upheaval
of
the
sea
above
the
valley
of
siddim
there
had
been
a
gradual
subsidence

even
before
all
this
evidence
was
in
a
judicial
decision
had
been
pronounced
upon
the
whole
question
by
an
authority
both
christian
and
scientific
from
whom
there
could
be
no
appeal
during
the
second
quarter
of
the
century
carl
ritter
of
the
university
of
berlin
began
giving
to
the
world
those
researches
which
have
placed
him
at
the
head
of
all
geographers
ancient
or
modern
and
finally
he
brought
together
those
relating
to
the
geography
of
the
holy
land
publishing
them
as
part
of
his
great
work
on
the
physical
geography
of
the
earth
he
was
a
christian
and
nothing
could
be
more
reverent
than
his
treatment
of
the
whole
subject
but
his
german
honesty
did
not
permit
him
to
conceal
the
truth
and
he
simply
classed
together
all
the
stories
of
the
dead
sea
old
and
new
no
matter
where
found
whether
in
the
sacred
books
of
jews
christians
or
mohammedans
whether
in
lives
of
saints
or
accounts
of
travellers
as
myths
and
sagas
from
this
decision
there
has
never
been
among
intelligent
men
any
appeal
the
recent
adjustment
of
orthodox
thought
to
the
scientific
view
of
the
dead
sea
legends
presents
some
curious
features
as
typical
we
may
take
the
travels
of
two
german
theologians
between
and
john
kranzel
pastor
in
munich
and
peter
schegg
lately
professor
in
the
university
of
that
city
the
archdiocese
of
is
one
of
those
in
which
the
attempt
to
suppress
modern
scientific
thought
has
been
most
steadily
carried
on
its
archbishops
have
constantly
shown
themselves
assiduous
in
securing
cardinals
hats
by
thwarting
science
and
by
stupefying
education
the
twin
towers
of
the
old
cathedral
of
munich
have
seemed
to
throw
a
killing
shadow
over
intellectual
development
in
that
region
naturally
then
these
two
clerical
travellers
from
that
diocese
did
not
commit
themselves
to
clearing
away
any
of
the
dead
sea
myths
but
it
is
significant
that
neither
of
them
follows
the
example
of
so
many
of
their
clerical
predecessors
in
defending
the
legend
they
steadily
avoid
it
altogether
the
more
recent
history
of
the
salt
pillar
since
lynch
deserves
mention
it
appears
that
the
travellers
immediately
after
him
found
it
shaped
by
the
storms
into
a
spire
that
a
year
or
two
later
it
had
utterly
disappeared
and
about
the
year
palmer
on
visiting
the
place
found
at
some
distance
from
the
main
salt
bed
as
he
says
a
tall
isolated
needle
of
rock
which
does
really
bear
a
curious
resemblance
to
an
arab
woman
with
a
child
upon
her
shoulders
and
finally
smith
dictionary
of
the
bible
the
standard
work
of
reference
for
scholars
makes
its
concession
to
the
old
belief
regarding
sodom
and
gomorrah
as
slight
as
possible
and
the
myth
of
lot
wife
entirely
disappears
iv
theological
efforts
at
triumph
of
the
scientific
view
the
theological
effort
to
compromise
with
science
now
came
in
more
strongly
than
ever
this
effort
had
been
made
long
before
as
we
have
seen
it
had
begun
to
show
itself
decidedly
as
soon
as
the
influence
of
the
baconian
philosophy
was
felt
le
clerc
suggested
that
the
shock
caused
by
the
sight
of
fire
from
heaven
killed
lot
wife
instantly
and
made
her
body
rigid
as
a
statue
eichhorn
suggested
that
she
fell
into
a
stream
of
melted
bitumen
michaelis
suggested
that
her
relatives
raised
a
monument
of
salt
rock
to
her
memory
friedrichs
suggested
that
she
fell
into
the
sea
and
that
the
salt
stiffened
around
her
clothing
thus
making
a
statue
of
her
some
claimed
that
a
shower
of
sulphur
came
down
upon
her
and
that
the
word
which
has
been
translated
salt
could
possibly
be
translated
sulphur
others
hinted
that
the
salt
by
its
antiseptic
qualities
preserved
her
body
as
a
mummy
de
saulcy
as
we
have
seen
thought
that
a
piece
of
salt
rock
fell
upon
her
and
very
recently
principal
dawson
has
ventured
the
explanation
that
a
flood
of
salt
mud
coming
from
a
volcano
incrusted
her
but
theologians
themselves
were
the
first
to
show
the
inadequacy
of
these
explanations
the
more
rationalistic
pointed
out
the
fact
that
they
were
contrary
to
the
sacred
text
von
bohlen
an
eminent
professor
at
konigsberg
in
his
sturdy
german
honesty
declared
that
the
salt
pillar
gave
rise
to
the
story
and
compared
the
pillar
of
salt
causing
this
transformation
legend
to
the
rock
in
greek
mythology
which
gave
rise
to
the
transformation
legend
of
niobe
on
the
other
hand
the
more
severely
orthodox
protested
against
such
attempts
to
explain
away
the
clear
statements
of
holy
writ
dom
calmet
while
presenting
many
of
these
explanations
made
as
early
as
his
time
gives
us
to
understand
that
nearly
all
theologians
adhered
to
the
idea
that
lot
wife
was
instantly
and
really
changed
into
salt
and
in
our
own
time
as
we
shall
presently
see
have
come
some
very
vigorous
protests
similar
attempts
were
made
to
explain
the
other
ancient
legends
regarding
the
dead
sea
one
of
the
most
recent
of
these
is
that
the
cities
of
the
plain
having
been
built
with
blocks
of
bituminous
rock
were
set
on
fire
by
lightning
a
contemporary
earthquake
helping
on
the
work
still
another
is
that
accumulations
of
petroleum
and
inflammable
gas
escaped
through
a
fissure
took
fire
and
so
produced
the
catastrophe

the
revolt
against
such
efforts
to
reconcile
scientific
fact
with
myth
and
legend
had
become
very
evident
about
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
and
van
de
velde
made
his
journey
he
was
a
most
devout
man
but
he
confessed
that
the
volcanic
action
at
the
dead
sea
must
have
been
far
earlier
than
the
catastrophe
mentioned
in
our
sacred
books
and
that
the
overthrow
of
sodom
and
gomorrah
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
a
few
years
later
an
eminent
dignitary
of
the
english
church
canon
tristram
doctor
of
divinity
and
fellow
of
the
royal
society
who
had
explored
the
holy
land
thoroughly
after
some
generalities
about
miracles
gave
up
the
whole
attempt
to
make
science
agree
with
the
myths
and
used
these
words
it
has
been
frequently
assumed
that
the
district
of
usdum
and
its
sister
cities
was
the
result
of
some
tremendous
geological
catastrophe
now
careful
examination
by
competent
geologists
such
as
monsieur
lartet
and
others
has
shown
that
the
whole
district
has
assumed
its
present
shape
slowly
and
gradually
through
a
succession
of
ages
and
that
its
peculiar
phenomena
are
similar
to
those
of
other
lakes
so
sank
from
view
the
whole
mass
of
dead
sea
myths
and
legends
and
science
gained
a
victory
both
for
geology
and
comparative
mythology
as
a
protest
against
this
sort
of
rationalism
appeared
in
an
edition
of
monseigneur
mislin
work
on
the
holy
places
in
order
to
give
weight
to
the
book
it
was
prefaced
by
letters
from
pope
pius
ix
and
sundry
high
ecclesiastics
and
from
alexandre
dumas
his
hatred
of
protestant
missionaries
in
the
east
is
phenomenal
he
calls
them
bagmen
ascribes
all
mischief
and
infamy
to
them
and
his
hatred
is
only
exceeded
by
his
credulity
he
cites
all
the
arguments
in
favour
of
the
salt
statue
at
usdum
as
the
identical
one
into
which
lot
wife
was
changed
adds
some
of
his
own
and
presents
her
as
a
type
of
doubt
and
heresy
with
the
proverbial
facility
of
dogmatists
in
translating
any
word
of
a
dead
language
into
anything
that
suits
their
purpose
he
says
that
the
word
in
the
nineteenth
chapter
of
genesis
which
is
translated
statue
or
pillar
may
be
translated
eternal
monument
he
is
especially
severe
on
poor
monsieur
de
saulcy
for
thinking
that
wife
was
killed
by
the
falling
of
a
piece
of
salt
rock
and
he
actually
boasts
that
it
was
he
who
caused
de
saulcy
a
member
of
the
french
institute
to
suppress
the
obnoxious
passage
in
a
later
edition
between
and
came
two
killing
blows
at
the
older
theories
and
they
were
dealt
by
two
american
scholars
of
the
highest
character
first
of
these
may
be
mentioned
philip
schaff
a
professor
in
the
presbyterian
theological
seminary
at
new
york
who
published
his
travels
in
in
a
high
degree
he
united
the
scientific
with
the
religious
spirit
but
the
trait
which
made
him
especially
fit
for
dealing
with
this
subject
was
his
straightforward
german
honesty
he
tells
the
simple
truth
regarding
the
pillar
of
salt
so
far
as
its
physical
origin
and
characteristics
are
concerned
and
leaves
his
reader
to
draw
the
natural
inference
as
to
its
relation
to
the
myth
with
the
fate
of
robertson
smith
in
scotland
and
woodrow
in
south
carolina
before
him
both
recently
driven
from
their
professorships
for
schaff
deserves
honour
for
telling
as
much
as
he
does
similar
in
effect
and
even
more
bold
in
statement
were
the
travels
of
the
rev
henry
osborn
published
in
in
a
truly
scientific
spirit
he
calls
attention
to
the
similarity
of
the
dead
sea
with
the
river
jordan
to
sundry
other
lake
and
river
systems
points
out
the
endless
variations
between
writers
describing
the
salt
formations
at
usdum
accounts
rationally
for
these
variations
and
quotes
from
report
saying
from
the
soluble
nature
of
the
salt
and
the
crumbling
looseness
of
the
marl
it
may
well
be
imagined
that
while
some
of
these
needles
are
in
the
process
of
formation
others
are
being
washed
away
thus
came
out
little
by
little
the
truth
regarding
the
dead
sea
myths
and
especially
the
salt
pillar
at
usdum
but
the
final
truth
remained
to
be
told
in
the
church
and
now
one
of
the
purest
men
and
truest
divines
of
this
century
told
it
arthur
stanley
dean
of
westminster
visiting
the
country
and
thoroughly
exploring
it
allowed
that
the
physical
features
of
the
dead
sea
and
its
shores
suggested
the
myths
and
legends
and
he
sums
up
the
whole
as
follows
a
great
mass
of
legends
and
exaggerations
partly
the
cause
and
partly
the
result
of
the
old
belief
that
the
cities
were
buried
under
the
dead
sea
has
been
gradually
removed
in
recent
years
so
too
about
the
same
time
conrad
furrer
pastor
of
the
great
church
of
peter
at
zurich
gave
to
the
world
a
book
of
travels
reverent
and
thoughtful
and
in
this
honestly
acknowledged
that
the
needles
of
salt
at
the
southern
end
of
the
dead
sea
in
primitive
times
gave
rise
to
the
tradition
that
lot
wife
was
transformed
into
a
statue
of
salt
thus
was
the
mythical
character
of
this
story
at
last
openly
confessed
by
leading
churchmen
on
both
continents
plain
statements
like
these
from
such
sources
left
the
high
theological
position
more
difficult
than
ever
and
now
a
new
compromise
was
attempted
as
the
siberian
mother
tried
to
save
her
child
from
the
pursuing
wolves
by
throwing
over
to
them
her
less
favoured
children
so
an
effort
was
now
made
in
a
leading
commentary
to
save
the
legends
of
the
valley
of
siddim
and
the
miraculous
destruction
of
the
cities

an
amusing
result
has
followed
this
development
of
opinion
as
we
have
already
seen
traveller
after
traveller
catholic
and
protestant
now
visits
the
dead
sea
and
hardly
one
of
them
follows
the
new

injunction
to
remember
lot
wife
nearly
every
one
of
them
seems
to
think
it
best
to
forget
her
of
the
great
mass
of
pious
legends
they
are
shy
enough
but
that
of
lot
wife
as
a
rule
they
seem
never
to
have
heard
of
and
if
they
do
allude
to
it
they
simply
cover
the
whole
subject
with
a
haze
of
pious
rhetoric
the
only
notice
of
the
lot
wife
legend
in
the
editions
of
robinson
at
my
command
is
a
very
curious
one
by
leopold
von

the
eminent
geologist
robinson
with
a
fearlessness
which
does
him
credit
consulted
von
buch
who
in
his
answer
was
evidently
inclined
to
make
things
easier
for
robinson
by
hinting
that
lot
was
so
much
struck
by
the
salt
formations
that
he
imagined
that
his
wife
had
been
changed
into
salt
on
this
theory
robinson
makes
no
comment
see
robinson
biblical
researches

london
vol
ii
naturally
under
this
state
of
things
there
has
followed
the
usual
attempt
to
throw
off
from
christendom
the
responsibility
of
the
old
belief
and
in
came
a
curious
effort
of
this
sort
in
that
year
appeared
the
rev
cunningham
geikie
valuable
work
on
the
holy
land
and
the
bible
in
it
he
makes
the
following
statement
as
to
the
salt
formation
at
usdum
here
and
there
hardened
portions
of
salt
withstanding
the
water
while
all
around
them
melts
and
wears
off
rise
up
isolated
pillars
one
of
which
bears
among
the
arabs
the
name
of
wife
in
the
light
of
the
previous
history
there
is
something
at
once
pathetic
and
comical
in
this
attempt
to
throw
the
myth
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
poor
arabs
the
myth
was
not
originated
by
mohammedans
it
appears
as
we
have
seen
first
among
the
jews
and
i
need
hardly
remind
the
reader
comes
out
in
the
book
of
wisdom
and
in
josephus
and
has
been
steadily
maintained
by
fathers
martyrs
and
doctors
of
the
church
by
at
least
one
pope
and
by
innumerable
bishops
priests
monks
commentators
and
travellers
catholic
and
protestant
ever
since
in
thus
throwing
the
responsibility
of
the
myth
upon
the
arabs
geikie
appears
to
show
both
the
perfervid
genius
of
his
countrymen
and
their
incapacity
to
recognise
a
joke
nor
is
he
more
happy
in
his
rationalistic
explanations
of
the
whole
mass
of
myths
he
supposes
a
terrific
storm
in
which
the
lightning
kindled
the
combustible
materials
of
the
cities
aided
perhaps
by
an
earthquake
but
this
shows
a
disposition
to
break
away
from
the
exact
statements
of
the
sacred
books
which
would
have
been
most
severely
condemned
by
the
universal
church
during
at
least
eighteen
hundred
years
of
its
history
nor
would
the
explanations
of
sir
william
dawson
have
fared
any
better
it
is
very
doubtful
whether
either
of
them
could
escape
unscathed
today
from
a
synod
of
the
free
church
of
scotland
or
of
any
of
the
leading
orthodox
bodies
in
the
southern
states
of

how
unsatisfactory
all
such
rationalism
must
be
to

truly
theological
mind
is
seen
not
only
in
the
dealings
with
robertson

in

most
clearly
in

not
only
the
danger
of
yielding
this
evidence
of
miracle
to
rationalism
but
the
fact
that
the
divinely
inspired
authority
of
the
book
of
wisdom
written
at
the
latest
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
before
christ
distinctly
refers
to
it
he
summons
josephus
as
a
witness
he
dwells
on
the
fact
that
clement
of
rome
irenaeus
hegesippus
and
cyril
who
as
bishop
of
jerusalem
must
have
known
better
than
any
other
person
what
existed
in
palestine
with
jerome
chrysostom
and
a
multitude
of
others
attest
as
a
matter
of
their
own
knowledge
or
of
popular
notoriety
that
the
remains
of
lot
wife
really
existed
in
their
time
in
the
form
of
a
column
of
salt
and
he
points
triumphantly
to
the
fact
that
lieutenant
lynch
found
this
very
column
in
the
presence
of
such
a
continuous
line
of
witnesses
some
of
them
considered
as
divinely
inspired
and
all
of
them
greatly
revered
a
line
extending
through
hundred
years
he
condemns
most
vigorously
all
those
who
do
not
believe
that
the
pillar
of
salt
now
at
usdum
is
identical
with
the
wife
of
lot
and
stigmatizes
them
as
people
who
do
not
wish
to
believe
the
truth
of
the
word
of
god
his
ignorance
of
many
of
the
simplest
facts
bearing
upon
the
legend
is
very
striking
yet
he
does
not
hesitate
to
speak
of
men
who
know
far
more
and
have
thought
far
more
upon
the
subject
as
grossly
ignorant
the
most
curious
feature
in
his
ignorance
is
the
fact
that
he
is
utterly
unaware
of
the
annual
changes
in
the
salt
statue
he
is
entirely
ignorant
of
such
facts
as
that
the
priest
gabriel
giraudet
in
the
sixteenth
century
found
the
statue
lying
down
that
the
monk
zwinner
found
it
in
the
seventeenth
century
standing
and
accompanied
by
a
dog
also
transformed
into
salt
that
prince
radziwill
found
no
statue
at
all
that
the
pious
vincent
briemle
in
the
eighteenth
century
found
the
monument
renewing
itself
that
about
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
lynch
found
it
in
the
shape
of
a
tower
or
column
forty
feet
high
that
within
two
years
afterward
de
saulcy
found
it
washed
into
the
form
of
a
spire
that
a
year
later
van
de
velde
found
it
utterly
washed
away
and
that
a
few
years
later
palmer
found
it
a
statue
bearing
a
striking
resemblance
to
an
arab
woman
with
a
child
in
her
arms
so
ended
the
last
great
demonstration
thus
far
on
the
side
of
sacred
science
the
last
retreating
shot
from
the
theological
rear
guard
it
is
but
just
to
say
that
a
very
great
share
in
the
honour
of
the
victory
of
science
in
this
field
is
due
to
men
trained
as
theologians
it
would
naturally
be
so
since
few
others
have
devoted
themselves
to
direct
labour
in
it
yet
great
honour
is
none
the
less
due
to
such
men
as
reland
mariti
smith
robinson
stanley
tristram
and
schat
they
have
rendered
even
a
greater
service
to
religion
than
to
science
for
they
have
made
a
beginning
at
least
of
doing
away
with
that
enforced
belief
in
myths
as
history
which
has
become
a
most
serious
danger
to
christianity
for
the
worst
enemy
of
christianity
could
wish
nothing
more
than
that
its
main
leaders
should
prove
that
it
can
not
be
adopted
save
by
those
who
accept
as
historical
statements
which
unbiased
men
throughout
the
world
know
to
be
mythical
the
result
of
such
a
demonstration
would
only
be
more
and
more
to
make
thinking
people
inside
the
church
dissemblers
and
thinking
people
outside
scoffers
far
better
is
it
to
welcome
the
aid
of
science
in
the
conviction
that
all
truth
is
one
and
in
the
light
of
this
truth
to
allow
theology
and
science
to
work
together
in
the
steady
evolution
of
religion
and
morality
the
revelations
made
by
the
sciences
which
most
directly
deal
with
the
history
of
man
all
converge
in
the
truth
that
during
the
earlier
stages
of
this
evolution
moral
and
spiritual
teachings
must
be
inclosed
in
myth
legend
and
parable
the
master
felt
this
when
he
gave
to
the
poor
peasants
about
him
and
so
to
the
world
his
simple
and
beautiful
illustrations
in
making
this
truth
clear
science
will
give
to
religion
far
more
than
it
will
take
away
for
it
will
throw
new
life
and
light
into
all
sacred
literature

i
origin
and
progress
of
hostility
to
loans
at
interest
among
questions
on
which
the
supporters
of
right
reason
in
political
and
social
science
have
only
conquered
theological
opposition
after
centuries
of
war
is
the
taking
of
interest
on
loans
in
hardly
any
struggle
has
rigid
adherence
to
the
letter
of
our
sacred
books
been
more
prolonged
and
injurious
certainly
if
the
criterion
of
truth
as
regards
any
doctrine
be
that
of
vincent
of
lerins
that
it
has
been
held
in
the
church
always
everywhere
and
by
all
then
on
no
point
may
a
christian
of
these
days
be
more
sure
than
that
every
savings
institution
every
loan
and
trust
company
every
bank
every
loan
of
capital
by
an
individual
every
means
by
which
accumulated
capital
has
been
lawfully
lent
even
at
the
most
moderate
interest
to
make
men
workers
rather
than
paupers
is
based
on
deadly
sin
the
early
evolution
of
the
belief
that
taking
interest
for
money
is
sinful
presents
a
curious
working
together
of
metaphysical
theological
and
humanitarian
ideas
in
the
main
centre
of
ancient
greek
civilization
the
loaning
of
money
at
interest
came
to
be
accepted
at
an
early
period
as
a
condition
of
productive
industry
and
no
legal
restriction
was
imposed
in
rome
there
was
a
long
process
of
development
the
greed
of
creditors
in
early
times
led
to
laws
against
the
taking
of
interest
but
though
these
lasted
long
that
strong
practical
sense
which
gave
rome
the
empire
of
the
world
substituted
finally
for
this
absolute
prohibition
the
establishment
of
rates
by
law
yet
many
of
the
leading
greek
and
roman
thinkers
opposed
this
practical
settlement
of
the
question
and
foremost
of
all
aristotle
in
a
metaphysical
way
he
declared
that
money
is
by
nature
barren
that
the
birth
of
money
from
money
is
therefore
unnatural
and
hence
that
the
taking
of
interest
is
to
be
censured
and
hated
plato
plutarch
both
the
catos
cicero
seneca
and
various
other
leaders
of
ancient
thought
arrived
at
much
the
same
conclusion
sometimes
from
sympathy
with
oppressed
debtors
sometimes
from
dislike
of
usurers
sometimes
from
simple
contempt
of
trade
from
these
sources
there
came
into
the
early
church
the
germ
of
a
theological
theory
upon
the
subject
but
far
greater
was
the
stream
of
influence
from
the
jewish
and
christian
sacred
books
in
the
old
testament
stood
various
texts
condemning
usury
the
term
usury
meaning
any
taking
of
interest
the
law
of
moses
while
it
allowed
usury
in
dealing
with
strangers
forbade
it
in
dealing
with
jews
in
the
new
testament
in
the
sermon
on
the
mount
as
given
by
luke
stood
the
text
lend
hoping
for
nothing
again
these
texts
seemed
to
harmonize
with
the
most
beautiful
characteristic
of
primitive
christianity
its
tender
care
for
the
poor
and
oppressed
hence
we
find
from
the
earliest
period
the
whole
weight
of
the
church
brought
to
bear
against
the
taking
of
interest
for
money
on
the
general
allowance
of
interest
for
money

this
unanimity
of
the
fathers
of
the
church
brought
about
a
crystallization
of
hostility
to
loans
into
numberless
decrees
of
popes
and
councils
and
kings
and
legislatures
throughout
christendom
during
more
than
fifteen
hundred
years
and
the
canon
law
was
shaped
in
accordance
with
these
at
first
these
were
more
especially
directed
against
the
clergy
but
we
soon
find
them
extending
to
the
laity
these
prohibitions
were
enforced
by
the
council
of
arles
in
and
a
modern
church
apologist
insists
that
every
great
assembly
of
the
church
from
the
council
of
elvira
in
to
that
of
vienne
in
inclusive
solemnly
condemned
lending

of
denying

burial
in

ground
and
similar
decrees
were
made
in
other
parts
of
europe
in
the
twelfth
century
the
greek
church
seems
to
have
relaxed
its
strictness
somewhat
but
the
roman
church
grew
more
severe
anselm
proved
from
the
scriptures
that
the
taking
of
interest
is
a
breach
of
the
ten
commandments
peter
lombard
in
his
sentences
made
the
taking
of
interest
purely
and
simply
theft
bernard
reviving
religious
earnestness
in
the
church
took
the
same
view
in
the
third
council
of
the
lateran
decreed
that
impenitent
should
be
excluded
from
the
altar
from
absolution
in
the
hour
of
death
and
from
christian
burial
pope
urban
iii
reiterated
the
declaration
that
the
passage
in
luke
forbade
the
taking
of
any
interest
whatever
pope
alexander
iii
declared
that
the
prohibition
in
this
matter
could
never
be
suspended
by
dispensation
in
the
thirteenth
century
pope
gregory
ix
dealt
an
especially
severe
blow
at
commerce
by
his
declaration
that
even
to
advance
on
interest
the
money
necessary
in
maritime
trade
was
damnable
usury
and
this
was
fitly
followed
by
gregory
x
who
forbade
christian
burial
to
those
guilty
of
this
practice
the
council
of
lyons
meted
out
the
same
penalty
this
idea
was
still
more
firmly
fastened
upon
the
world
by
the
two
greatest
thinkers
of
the
time
first
by
thomas
aquinas
who
knit
it
into
the
mind
of
the
church
by
the
use
of
the
scriptures
and
of
aristotle
and
next
by
dante
who
pictured
in
one
of
the
worst
regions
of
hell
about
the
beginning
of
the
fourteenth
century
the
subtile
doctor
of
the
middle
ages
duns
scotus
gave
to
the
world
an
exquisite
piece
of
reasoning
in
evasion
of
the
accepted
doctrine
but
all
to
no
purpose
the
council
of
vienne
presided
over
by
pope
clement
v
declared
that
if
any
one
shall
pertinaciously
presume
to
affirm
that
the
taking
of
interest
for
money
is
not
a
sin
we
decree
him
to
be
a
heretic
fit
for
punishment
this
infallible
utterance
bound
the
dogma
with
additional
force
on
the
conscience
of
the
universal
church
nor
was
this
a
doctrine
enforced
by
rulers
only
the
people
were
no
less
strenuous
in
the
city
authorities
of
london
enacted
that
if
any
person
shall
lend
or
put
into
the
hands
of
any
person
gold
or
silver
to
receive
gain
thereby
such
person
shall
have
the
punishment
for
usurers
and
in
the
same
year
the
commons
prayed
the
king
that
the
laws
of
london
against
usury
might
have
the
force
of
statutes
throughout
the
realm
in
the
fifteenth
century
the
council
of
the
church
at
salzburg
excluded
from
communion
and
burial
any
who
took
interest
for
money
and
this
was
a
very
general
rule
throughout
germany
an
exception
was
indeed
sometimes
made
some
canonists
held
that
jews
might
be
allowed
to
take
interest
since
they
were
to
be
damned
in
any
case
and
their
monopoly
of
might
prevent
christians
from
losing
their
souls
by
going
into
the
business
yet
even
the
jews
were
from
time
to
time
punished
for
the
crime
of
usury
and
as
regards
christians
punishment
was
bestowed
on
the
dead
as
well
as
the
living
the
bodies
of
dead
being
here
and
there
dug
up
and
cast
out
of
consecrated
ground
the
popular
preachers
constantly
declaimed
against
all
who
took
interest
the
medieval
anecdote

for
pulpit
use
are
especially
full
on
this
point

de
vitry
tells
us
that
demons
on

occasion
filled

this
theological
hostility
to
the
taking
of
interest
was
imbedded
firmly
in
the
canon
law
again
and
again
it
defined
usury
to
be
the
taking
of
anything
of
value
beyond
the
exact
original
amount
of
a
loan
and
under
sanction
of
the
universal
church
it
denounced
this
as
a
crime
and
declared
all
persons
defending
it
to
be
guilty
of
heresy
what
this
meant
the
world
knows
but
too
well
the
whole
evolution
of
european
civilization
was
greatly
hindered
by
this
conscientious
policy
money
could
only
be
loaned
in
most
countries
at
the
risk
of
incurring
odium
in
this
world
and
damnation
in
the
next
hence
there
was
but
little
capital
and
few
lenders
the
rates
of
interest
became
at
times
enormous
as
high
as
forty
per
cent
in
england
and
ten
per
cent
a
month
in
italy
and
spain
commerce
manufactures
and
general
enterprise
were
dwarfed
while
pauperism
flourished
yet
worse
than
these
were
the
moral
results
doing
what
one
holds
to
be
evil
is
only
second
in
bad
consequences
to
doing
what
is
really
evil
hence
all
lending
and
borrowing
even
for
the
most
legitimate
purposes
and
at
the
most
reasonable
rates
tended
to
debase
both
borrower
and
lender
the
prohibition
of
lending
at
interest
in
continental
europe
promoted
luxury
and
discouraged
economy
the
rich
who
were
not
engaged
in
business
finding
no
easy
way
of
employing
their
incomes
productively
spent
them
largely
in
ostentation
and
riotous
living
one
evil
effect
is
felt
in
all
parts
of
the
world
to
this
hour
the
jews
so
acute
in
intellect
and
strong
in

were
virtually
drawn

driven
out
of

these
evils
were
so
manifest
when
trade
began
to
revive
throughout
europe
in
the
fifteenth
century
that
most
earnest
exertions
were
put
forth
to
induce
the
church
to
change
its
position
the
first
important
effort
of
this
kind
was
made
by
john
gerson
his

him
chancellor
of
the
university
of

his
sacred
learning
made

his
piety
led
men

him
the
imitation
of
christ
shaking
off
theological
shackles
he
declared
better
is
it
to
lend
money
at
reasonable
interest
and
thus
to
give
aid
to
the
poor
than
to
see
them
reduced
by
poverty
to
steal
waste
their
goods
and
sell
at
a
low
price
their
personal
and
real
property
but
this
idea
was
at
once
buried
beneath
citations
from
the
scriptures
the
fathers
councils
popes
and
the
canon
law
even
in
the
most
active
countries
there
seemed
to
be
no
hope
in
england
under
henry
vii
cardinal
morton
the
lord
chancellor
addressed
parliament
asking
it
to
take
into
consideration
loans
of
money
at
interest
the
result
was
a
law
which
imposed
on
lenders
at
interest
a
fine
of
a
hundred
pounds
besides
the
annulment
of
the
loan
and
to
show
that
there
was
an
offence
against
religion
involved
there
was
added
a
clause
reserving
to
the
church
notwithstanding
this
punishment
the
correction
of
their
souls
according
to
the
laws
of
the
same
similar
enactments
were
made
by
civil
authority
in
various
parts
of
europe
and
just
when
the
trade
commerce
and
manufactures
of
the
modern
epoch
had
received

immense

from
the
great

another
mode
of
obtaining
relief
was
tried
subtle
theologians
devised
evasions
of
various
sorts
two
among
these
inventions
of
the
schoolmen
obtained
much
notoriety
the
first
was
the
doctrine
of
damnum
emergens
if
a
lender
suffered
loss
by
the
failure
of
the
borrower
to
return
a
loan
at
a
date
named
compensation
might
be
made
thus
it
was
that
if
the
nominal
date
of
payment
was
made
to
follow
quickly
after
the
real
date
of
the
loan
the
compensation
for
the
anticipated
delay
in
payment
had
a
very
strong
resemblance
to
interest
equally
cogent
was
the
doctrine
of
lucrum
cessans
if
a
man
in
order
to
lend
money
was
obliged
to
diminish
his
income
from
productive
enterprises
it
was
claimed
that
he
might
receive
in
return
in
addition
to
his
money
an
amount
exactly
equal
to
this
diminution
in
his
income
but
such
evasions
were
looked
upon
with
little
favour
by
the
great
body
of
theologians
and
the
name
of
thomas
aquinas
was
triumphantly
cited
against
them
opposition
on
scriptural
grounds
to
the
taking
of
interest
was
not
confined
to
the
older
church
protestantism
was
led
by
luther
and
several
of
his
associates
into
the
same
line
of
thought
and
practice
said
luther
to
exchange
anything
with
any
one
and
gain
by
the
exchange
is
not
to
do
a
charity
but
to
steal
every
usurer
is
a
thief
worthy
of
the
gibbet
i
call
those
usurers
who
lend
money
at
five
or
six
per
cent
but
it
is
only
just
to
say
that
at
a
later
period
luther
took
a
much
more
moderate
view
melanchthon
defining
usury
as
any
interest
whatever
condemned
it
again
and
again
and
the
goldberg
catechism
of
for
which
he
wrote
a
preface
and
recommendation
declares
every
person
taking
interest
for
money
a
thief
from
generation
to
generation
this
doctrine
was
upheld
by
the
more
eminent
divines
of
the
lutheran
church
in
all
parts
of
germany
the
english
reformers
showed
the
same
hostility
to
loans
under
henry
viii
the
law
of
henry
vii
against
taking
interest
had
been
modified
for
the
better
but
the
revival
of
religious
feeling
under
edward
vi
caused
in
the
passage
of
the
bill
of
usury
in
this
it
is
said
forasmuch
as
usury
is
by
the
word
of
god
utterly
prohibited
as
a
vice
most
odious
and
detestable
as
in
divers
places
of
the
holy
scriptures
it
is
evident
to
be
seen
which
thing
by
no
godly
teachings
and
persuasions
can
sink
into
the
hearts
of
divers
greedy
uncharitable
and
covetous
persons
of
this
realm
nor
yet
by
any
terrible
threatenings
of
god
wrath
and
vengeance
it
is
enacted
that
whosoever
shall
thereafter
lend
money
for
any
manner
of
usury
increase
lucre
gain
or
interest
to
be
had
received
or
hoped
for
shall
forfeit
principal
and
interest
and
suffer
imprisonment
and
fine

pleasure

but
most
fortunately
it

though
at
times
stumbling
over
the
usual
texts
against
the
taking
of

for

turned
finally
in
the

direction
he
cut
through
the
metaphysical
arguments

and
characterized
the
subtleties
devised
to
evade
the
scriptures
as
a
childish
game
with
god
in
place
of
these
subtleties
there
was
developed
among
protestants
a
serviceable
fiction
the
statement
that
usury
means
illegal
or
oppressive
interest
under
the
action
of
this
fiction
commerce
and
trade
revived
rapidly
in
protestant
countries
though
with
occasional
checks
from
exact
interpreters
of
scripture
at
the
same
period
in
france
the
great
protestant
jurist
dumoulin
brought
all
his
legal
learning
and
skill
in
casuistry
to
bear
on
the
same
side
a
certain
ferretlike
acuteness
and
litheness
seem
to
have
enabled
him
to
hunt
down
the
opponents
of
through
the
most
tortuous
arguments
of
scholasticism
in
england
the
struggle
went
on
with
varying
fortune
statesmen
on
one
side
and
theologians
on
the
other
we
have
seen
how
under
henry
viii
interest
was
allowed
at
a
fixed
rate
and
how
the
development
of
english
protestantism
having
at
first
strengthened
the
old
theological
view
there
was
under
edward
vi
a
temporarily
successful
attempt
to
forbid
the
taking
of
interest
by
law
the
puritans
dwelling
on
old
testament
texts
continued
for
a
considerable
time
especially
hostile
to
the
taking
of
any
interest
henry
smith
a
noted
preacher
thundered
from
the
pulpit
of
clement
danes
in
london
against
the
evasions
of
scripture
which
permitted
men
to
lend
money
on
interest
at
all
in
answer
to
the
contention
that
only
biting
usury
was
oppressive
wilson
a
noted
upholder
of
the
strict
theological
view
in
political
economy
declared
there
is
difference
in
deed
between
the
bite
of
a
dogge
and
the
bite
of
a
flea
and
yet
though
the
flea
doth
lesse
harm
yet
the
flea
doth
bite
after
hir
kinde
yea
and
draweth
blood
too
but
what
a
world
this
is
that
men
will
make
sin
to
be
but
a
fleabite
when
they
see
god
word
directly
against
them
the
same
view
found
strong
upholders
among
contemporary
english
catholics
one
of
the
most
eminent
of
these
nicholas
sanders
revived
very
vigorously
the
use
of
an
old
scholastic
argument
he
insisted
that
man
can
not
sell
time
that
time
is
not
a
human
possession
but
something
which
is
given
by
god
alone
he
declared
time
was
not
of
your
gift
to
your
neighbour
but
of
god
gift
to
you
both
in
the
parliament
of
the
period
we
find
strong
assertions
of
the
old
idea
with
constant
reference
to
scripture
and
the
fathers
in
one
debate
wilson
cited
from
ezekiel
and
other
prophets
and
attributed
to
augustine
the
doctrine
that
to
take
but
a
cup
of
wine
is
usury
and
damnable
fleetwood
recalled
the
law
of
king
edward
the
confessor
which
submitted
usurers
to
the
ordeal
but
arguments
of
this
sort
had
little
influence
upon
elizabeth
and
her
statesmen
threats
of
damnation
in
the
next
world
troubled
them
little
if
they
could
have
their
way
in
this
they
the
practice
of
taking
interest
under
restrictions
and
this
in
various
forms
has
remained
in
england
ever
since
most
notable
in
this
phase
of
the
evolution
of
scientific
doctrine
in
political
economy
at
that
period
is
the
emergence
of
a
recognised
difference
between
usury
and
interest
between
these
two
words
which
had
so
long
been
synonymous
a
distinction
now
appears
the
former
being
construed
to
indicate
oppressive
interest
and
the
latter
just
rates
for
the
use
of
money
this
idea
gradually
sank
into
the
popular
mind
of
protestant
countries
and
the
scriptural
texts
no
longer
presented
any
difficulty
to
the
people
at
large
since
there
grew
up
a
general
belief
that
the
word
usury
as
employed
in
scripture
had
always
meant
exorbitant
interest
and
this
in
spite
of
the
parable
of
the
talents
still
that
the
old
aristotelian
quibble
had
not
been
entirely
forgotten
is
clearly
seen
by
various
passages
in
shakespeare
merchant
of
venice
but
this
line
of
reasoning
seems
to
have
received
its
quietus
from
lord
bacon
he
did
not
indeed
develop
a
strong
and
connected
argument
on
the
subject
but
he
burst
the
bonds
of
aristotle
and
based
interest
for
money
upon
natural
laws
how
powerful
the
new
current
of
thought
was
is
seen
from
the
fact
that
james
i
of
all
monarchs
the
most
fettered
by
scholasticism
and
theology
sanctioned
a
statute
dealing
with
interest
for
money
as
absolutely
necessary
yet
even
after
this
the
old
idea
asserted
itself
for
the
bishops
utterly
refused
to
agree
to
the
law
allowing
interest
until
a
proviso
was
inserted
that
nothing
in
this
law
contained
shall
be
construed
or
expounded
to
allow
the
practice
of
usury
in
point
of
religion
or
conscience
the
old
view
cropped
out
from
time
to
time
in
various
public
declarations
famous
among
these
were
the
treatise
of
usury
published
in
by
fenton
who
restated
the
old
arguments
with
much
force
and
the
usury
condemned
of
john
blaxton
published
in
blaxton
who
also
was
a
clergyman
defined
usury
as
the
taking
of
any
interest
whatever
for
money
citing
in
support
of
this
view
six
archbishops
and
bishops
and
over
thirty
doctors
of
divinity
in
the
anglican
church
some
of
their
utterances
being
very
violent
and
all
of
them
running
their
roots
down
into
texts
of
scripture
typical
among
these
is
a
sermon
of
bishop
sands
in
which
he
declares
regarding
the
taking
of
interest
this
canker
hath
corrupted
all
england
we
shall
doe
god
and
our
country
true
service
by
taking
away
this

ii
retreat
of
the
church
protestant
and
catholic
but
about
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
sir
robert
filmer
gave
this
doctrine
the
heaviest
blow
it
ever
received
in
england
taking
up
fenton
treatise
he
answered
it
and
all
works
like
it
in
a
way
which
however
unsuitable
to
this
century
was
admirably
adapted
to
that
he
cites
scripture
and
chops
logic
after
a
masterly
manner
characteristic
is
this
declaration
paul
doth
with
one
breath
reckon
up
seventeen
sins
and
yet
usury
is
none
of
them
but
many
preachers
can
not
reckon
up
seven
deadly
sins
except
they
make
usury
one
of
them
filmer
followed
fenton
not
only
through
his
theology
but
through
his
political
economy
with
such
relentless
keenness
that
the
old
doctrine
seems
to
have
been
then
and
there
practically
worried
out
of
existence
so
far
as
england
was
concerned
departures
from
the
strict
scriptural
doctrines
regarding
interest
soon
became
frequent
in
protestant
countries
and
they
were
followed
up
with
especial
vigour
in
holland
various
theologians
in
the
dutch
church
attempted
to
assert
the
scriptural
view
by
excluding
bankers
from
the
holy
communion
but
the
commercial
vigour
of
the
republic
was
too
strong
salmasius
led
on
the
forces
of
right
reason
brilliantly
and
by
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
question
was
settled
rightly
in
that
country
this
work
was
aided
indeed
by
a
far
greater
man
hugo
grotius
but
here
was
shown
the
power
of
an
established
dogma
great
as
grotius
was
and
it
may
well
be
held
that
his
book
on
war
and
peace
has
wrought
more
benefit
to
humanity
than
any
other
attributed
to
human
authorship
he
was
in
the
matter
of
interest
for
money
too
much
entangled
in
theological
reasoning
to
do
justice
to
his
cause
or
to
himself
he
declared
the
prohibition
of
it
to
be
scriptural
but
resisted
the
doctrine
of
aristotle
and
allowed
interest
on
certain
natural
and
practical
grounds
in
germany
the
struggle
lasted
longer
of
some
little
significance
perhaps
is
the
demand
of
adam
contzen
in
that
lenders
at
interest
should
be
punished
as
thieves
but
by
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
puffendorf
and
leibnitz
had
gained
the
victory
protestantism
open
as
it
was
to
the
currents
of
modern
thought
could
not
long
continue
under
the
dominion
of
ideas
unfavourable
to
economic
development
and
perhaps
the
most
remarkable
proof
of
this
was
presented
early
in
the
eighteenth
century
in
america
by
no
less
strict
a
theologian
than
cotton
mather
in
his
magnalia
he
argues
against
the
whole
theological
view
with
a
boldness
acuteness
and
good
sense
which
cause
us
to
wonder
that
this
can
be
the
same
man
who
was
so
infatuated
regarding
witchcraft
after
an
argument
so
conclusive

his

but
while
the
retreat
of
the
protestant
church
from
the
old
doctrine
regarding
the
taking
of
interest
was
henceforth
easy
in
the
catholic
church
it
was
far
more
difficult
infallible
popes
and
councils
with
saints
fathers
and
doctors
had
so
constantly
declared
the
taking
of
any
interest
at
all
to
be
contrary
to
scripture
that
the
more
exact
though
less
fortunate
interpretation
of
the
sacred
text
relating
to
interest
continued
in
catholic
countries
when
it
was
attempted
in
france
in
the
seventeenth
century
to
argue
that
usury
means
oppressive
interest
the
theological
faculty
of
the
sorbonne
declared
that
usury
is
the
taking
of
any
interest
at
all
no
matter
how
little
and
the
eighteenth
chapter
of
ezekiel
was
cited
to
clinch
this
argument
another
attempt
to
ease
the
burden
of
industry
and
commerce
was
made
by
declaring
that
usury
means
interest
demanded
not
as
a
matter
of
favour
but
as
a
matter
of
right
this
too
was
solemnly
condemned
by
pope
innocent
xi
again
an
attempt
was
made
to
find
a
way
out
of
the
difficulty
by
declaring
that
usury
is
interest
greater
than
the
law
allows
this
too
was
condemned
and
so
also
was
the
declaration
that
usury
is
interest
on
loans
not
for
a
fixed
time
still
the
forces
of
right
reason
pressed
on
and
among
them
in
the
seventeenth
century
in
france
was
richard
simon
he
attempted
to
gloss
over
the
declarations
of
scripture
against
lending
at
interest
in
an
elaborate
treatise
but
was
immediately
confronted
by
bossuet
just
as
bossuet
had
mingled
scripture
with
astronomy
and
opposed
the
copernican
theory
so
now
he
mingled
scripture
with
political
economy
and
denounced
the
lending
of
money
at
interest
he
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
scriptures
the
councils
of
the
church
from
the
beginning
the
popes
the
fathers
had
all
interpreted
the
prohibition
of
usury
to
be
a
prohibition
of
any
lending
at
interest
and
he
demonstrated
this
interpretation
to
be
the
true
one
simon
was
put
to
confusion
and
his
book
condemned
there
was
but
too
much
reason
for
bossuet
interpretation
there
stood
the
fact
that
the
prohibition
of
one
of
the
most
simple
and
beneficial
principles
in
political
and
economical
science
was
affirmed
not
only
by
the
fathers
but
by
councils
of
the
church
six
of
them
general
councils
and
by
seventeen
popes
to
say
nothing
of
innumerable
doctors
in
theology
and
canon
law
and
these
prohibitions
by
the
church
had
been
accepted
as
of
divine
origin
by
all
obedient
sons
of
the
church
in
the
government
of
france
such
rulers
as
charles
the
bald
in
the
ninth
century
and
louis
in
the
thirteenth
had
riveted
this
idea
into
the
civil
law
so
firmly
that
it
seemed
impossible
ever
to
detach
it
for
the
declaration
of
the
sorbonne
in

seventeenth

taking
of

italy
was
one
of
the
countries
in
which
the
theological
theory
regarding
usury
lending
at
interest
was
most
generally
asserted
and
assented
to
among
the
great
number
of
italian
canonists
who
supported
the
theory
two
deserve
especial
mention
as
affording
a
contrast
to
the
practical
manner
in
which
the
commercial
italians
met
the
question
in
the
sixteenth
century
very
famous
among
canonists
was
the
learned
benedictine
vilagut
in
he
published
at
venice
his
great
work
on
usury
supporting
with
much
learning
and
vigour
the
most
extreme
theological
consequences
of
the
old
doctrine
he
defines
usury
as
the
taking
of
anything
beyond
the
original
loan
and
declares
it
mortal
sin
he
advocates
the
denial
to
usurers
of
christian
burial
confession
the
sacraments
absolution
and
connection
with
the
universities
he
declares
that
priests
receiving
offerings
from
usurers
should
refrain
from
exercising
their
ministry
until
the
matter
is
passed
upon
by
the
bishop
about
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
another
ponderous
folio
was
published
in
venice
upon
the
same
subject
and
with
the
same
title
by
onorato
leotardi
so
far
from
showing
any
signs
of
yielding
he
is
even
more
extreme
than
vilagut
had
been
and
quotes
with
approval
the
old
declaration
that
lenders
of
money
at
interest
are
not
only
robbers
but
murderers
so
far
as
we
can
learn
no
real
opposition
was
made
in
either
century
to
this
theory
as
a
theory
as
to
practice
it
was
different
the
italian
traders
did
not
answer
theological
argument
they
simply
overrode
it
in
spite
of
theology
great
banks
were
established
and
especially
that
of
venice
at
the
end
of
the
twelfth
century
and
those
of
barcelona
and
genoa
at
the
beginning
of
the
fifteenth
nowhere
was
commerce
carried
on
in
more
complete
defiance
of
this
and
other
theological
theories
hampering
trade
than
in
the
very
city
where
these
great
treatises
were
published
the
sin
of
usury
like
the
sin
of
commerce
with
the
mohammedans
seems
to
have
been
settled
for
by
the
venetian
merchants
on
their
deathbeds
and
greatly
to
the
advantage
of
the
magnificent
churches
and
ecclesiastical
adornments
of
the
city
by
the
seventeenth
century
the
clearest
thinkers
in
the
roman
church
saw
that
her
theology
must
be
readjusted
to
political
economy
so
began
a
series
of
amazing
attempts
to
reconcile
a
view
permitting
usury
with
the
long
series
of
decrees
of
popes
and
councils
forbidding
it
in
spain
the
great
jesuit
casuist
escobar
led
the
way
and
rarely
had
been
seen
such
exquisite
but
his
efforts
were
not
received
with
the
gratitude
they
perhaps
deserved
pascal
revolting
at
their
moral
effect
attacked
them
unsparingly
in
his
provincial
letters
citing
especially
such
passages
as
the
following
it
is
usury
to
receive
profit
from
those
to
whom
one
lends
if
it
be
exacted
as
justly
due
but
if
it
be
exacted
as
a
debt
of
gratitude
it
is
not
usury
this
and
a
multitude
of
similar
passages
pascal
covered
with
the
keen
ridicule
and
indignant
denunciation
of
which
he
was
so
great
a
master
but
even
the
genius
of
pascal
could
not
stop
such
efforts
in
the
eighteenth
century
they
were
renewed
by
a
far
greater
theologian
than
escobar
by
him
who
was
afterward
made
a
saint
and
proclaimed
a
doctor
of
the
church
alphonso
liguori
starting
with
bitter
denunciations
of
usury
liguori
soon
developed
a
multitude
of
subtle
devices
for
escaping
the
guilt
of
it
presenting
a
long
and
elaborate
theory
of
mental
usury
he
arrives
at
the
conclusion
that
if
the
borrower
pay
interest
of
his
own
free
will
the
lender
may
keep
it
in
answer
to
the
question
whether
the
lender
may
keep
what
the
borrower
paid
not
out
of
gratitude
but
out
of
fear
fear
that
otherwise
loans
might
be
refused
him
in
future
liguori
says
to
be
usury
it
must
be
paid
by
reason
of
a
contract
or
as
justly
due
payment
by
reason
of
such
a
fear
does
not
cause
interest
to
be
paid
as
an
actual
price
again
liguori
tells
us
it
is
not
usury
to
exact
something
in
return
for
the
danger
and
expense
of
regaining
the
principal
the
old
subterfuges
of
damnum
emergens
and
lucrum
cessans
are
made
to
do
full
duty
a
remarkable
quibble
is
found
in
the
answer
to
the
question
whether
he
sins
who
furnishes
money
to
a
man
whom
he
knows
to
intend
employing
it
in
usury
after
citing
affirmative
opinions
from
many
writers
liguori
says
notwithstanding
these
opinions
the
better
opinion
seems
to
me
to
be
that
the
man
thus
putting
out
his
money
is
not
bound
to
make
restitution
for
his
action
is
not
injurious
to
the
borrower
but
rather
favourable
to
him
and
this
reasoning
the
saint
develops
at
great
length
in
the
latin
countries
this
sort
of
casuistry
eased
the
relations
of
the
church
with
the
bankers
and
it
was
full
time
for
now
there
came
arguments
of
a
different
kind
the
eighteenth
century
philosophy
had
come
upon
the
stage
and
the
first
effective
onset
of
political
scientists
against
the
theological
opposition
in
southern
europe
was
made
in
italy
the
most
noted
leaders
in
the
attack
being
galiani
and
maffei
here
and
there
feeble
efforts
were
made
to
meet
them
but
it
was
felt
more
and
more
by
thinking
churchmen
that
entirely
different
tactics
must
be
adopted
about
the
same
time
came
an
attack
in
france
and
though
its
results
were
less
immediate
at
home
they
were
much
more
effective

thinker

interests
of
the
world
about
him
in
eighteen
months
it
went
through
editions
it
was
translated
into
every
civilized
language
and
among
the
things
on
which
montesquieu
brought
his
wit
and
wisdom
to
bear
with
especial
force
was
the
doctrine
of
the
church
regarding
interest
on
loans
in
doing
this
he
was
obliged
to
use
a
caution
in
forms
which
seems
strangely
at
variance
with
the
boldness
of
his
ideas
in
view
of
the
strictness
of
ecclesiastical
control
in
france
he
felt
it
safest
to
make
his
whole
attack
upon
those
theological
and
economic
follies
of
mohammedan
countries
which
were
similar

in
the
first
years
of
the
century
the
jesuit
casuists
had
come
to
the
rescue
with
exquisite
subtlety
some
of
their
acutest
intellects
devoted
themselves
to
explaining
away
the
utterances
on
this
subject
of
saints
fathers
doctors
popes
and
councils
these
explanations
were
wonderfully
ingenious
but
many
of
the
older
churchmen
continued
to
insist
upon
the
orthodox
view
and
at
last
the
pope
himself
intervened
fortunately
for
the
world
the
seat
of
peter
was
then
occupied
by
benedict
xiv
certainly
one
of
the
most
gifted
morally
and
intellectually
in
the
whole
line
of
roman
pontiffs
tolerant
and
sympathetic
for
the
oppressed
he
saw
the
necessity
of
taking
up
the
question
and
he
grappled
with
it
effectually
he
rendered
to
catholicism
a
service
like
that
which
calvin
had
rendered
to
protestantism
by
shrewdly
cutting
a
way
through
the
theological
barrier
in
he
issued
his
encyclical
vix
pervenit
which
declared
that
the
doctrine
of
the
church
remained
consistent
with
itself
that
usury
is
indeed
a
sin
and
that
it
consists
in
demanding
any
amount
beyond
the
exact
amount
lent
but
that
there
are
occasions
when
on
special
grounds
the
lender
may
obtain
such
additional
sum
what
these
occasions
and
special
grounds
might
be
was
left
very
vague
but
this
action
was
sufficient
at
the
same
time
no
new
restrictions
upon
books
advocating
the
taking
of
interest
for
money
were
imposed
and
in
the
year
following
his
encyclical
benedict
openly
accepted
the
dedication
of
one
of
them
the
work
of
maffei
and
perhaps
the
most
cogent
of
all
like
the
casuistry
of
boscovich
in
using
the
copernican
theory
for
convenience
in
argument
while
acquiescing
in
its
condemnation
by
the
church
authorities
this
encyclical
of
pope
benedict
broke
the
spell

has

telling
an
untruth

to
preserve
the
consistency
of
papal
action
in
the
matter
of
usury
pp
and
elsewhere
yet
in
this
case
as
in
others
insurrections
against
the
sway
of
scientific
truth
appeared
among
some
overzealous
religionists
when
the
sorbonne
having
retreated
from
its
old
position
armed
itself
with
new
casuistries
against
those
who
held
to
its
earlier
decisions
sundry
provincial
doctors
in
theology
protested
indignantly
making
the
old
citations
from
the
scriptures
fathers
saints
doctors
popes
councils
and
canonists
again
the
roman
court
intervened
in
the
inquisition
at
rome
with
the
approval
of
pius
viii
though
still
declining
to
commit
itself
on
the
doctrine
involved
decreed
that
as
to
practice
confessors
should
no
longer
disturb
lenders
of
money
at
legal
interest
but
even
this
did
not
quiet
the
more
conscientious
theologians
the
old
weapons
were
again
furbished
and
hurled
by
the
abbe
laborde
vicar
of
the
metropolitan
archdiocese
of
auch
and
by
the
abbe
dennavit
professor
of
theology
at
lyons
good
abbe
dennavit
declared
that
he
refused
absolution
to
those
who
took
interest
and
to
priests
who
pretend
that
the
sanction
of
the
civil
law
is
sufficient
but
the
wisdom
of
the
serpent
was
again
brought
into
requisition
and
early
in
the
decade
between
and
the
abbate
mastrofini
issued
a
work
on
usury
which
he
declared
on
its
demonstrated
that
moderate
usury
is
not
contrary
to
holy
scripture
or
natural
law
or
the
decisions
of
the
church
nothing
can
be
more
comical
than
the
suppressions
of
truth
evasions
of
facts
jugglery
with
phrases
and
perversions
of
history
to
which
the
abbate
is
forced
to
resort
throughout
his
book
in
order
to
prove
that
the
church
has
made
no
mistake
in
the
face
of
scores
of
explicit
deliverances
and
decrees
of
fathers
doctors
popes
and
councils
against
the
taking
of
any
interest
whatever
for
money
he
coolly
pretended
that
what
they
had
declared
against
was
exorbitant
interest
he
made
a
merit
of
the
action
of
the
church
and
showed
that
its
course
had
been
a
blessing
to
humanity
but
his
masterpiece
is
in
dealing
with
the
edicts
of
clement
v
and
benedict
xiv
as
to
the
first
it
will
be
remembered
that
clement
in
accord
with
the
council
of
vienne
had
declared
that
any
one
who
shall
pertinaciously
presume
to
affirm
that
the
taking
of
interest
for
money
is
not
a
sin
we
decree
him
to
be
a
heiretic
fit
for
punishment
and
we
have
seen
that
benedict
xiv
did
not
at
all
deviate
from
the
doctrines
of
his
predecessors
yet
mastrofini
is
equal
to
his
task
and
brings
out
as
the
conclusion
of
his
book
the
statement
put
upon
his
that
what
the
church
condemns
is
only
exorbitant
interest
this
work
was
sanctioned
by
various
high
ecclesiastical
dignitaries
and
served
its
purpose
for
it
covered
the
retreat
of
the
church
in
the
holy
office
answering
a
question
solemnly
put
by
the
bishop
of
ariano
as
solemnly
declared
that
those
who
take
eight
per
cent
interest
per
annum
are
not
to
be
disquieted
and
in
appeared
a
book
published
under
authority

the
faithful
to
take

fought

perversion
of

in

greek
church
many
of
the
peasantry
of
russia
were
prevented
from
raising
and
eating
potatoes
how
in
scotland
at
the
beginning
of
this
century
the
use
of
fanning
mills
for
winnowing
grain
was
widely
denounced
as
contrary
to
the
text
the
wind
bloweth
where
it
listeth
as
leaguing
with
satan
who
is
prince
of
the
powers
of
the
air
and
therefore
as
sufficient
cause
for
excommunication
from
the
scotch
church
instructive
it
would
be
also
to
note
how
the
introduction
of
railways
was
declared
by
an
archbishop
of
the
french
church
to
be
an
evidence
of
the
divine
displeasure
against
country
innkeepers
who
set
meat
before
their
guests
on
fast
days
and
who
were
now
punished
by
seeing
travellers
carried
by
their
doors
how
railways
and
telegraphs
were
denounced
from
a
few
noted
pulpits
as
heralds
of
antichrist
and
how
in
protestant
england
the
curate
of
rotherhithe
at
the
breaking
in
of
the
thames
tunnel
so
destructive
to
life
and
property
declared
it
from
his
pulpit
a
just
judgment
upon
the
presumptuous
aspirations
of
mortal
man
the
same
tendency
is
seen
in
the
opposition
of
conscientious
men
to
the
taking
of
the
census
in

the
united
states
on
account
of
the
terms
in
which
the

is
spoken

scruples
on
similar
grounds
have
also
been
avowed
against
so
beneficial
a
thing

unimportant
as
these

are

the
great
sacred
books
of
the
world
are
the
most
precious
of
human
possessions
they
embody
the
deepest
searchings
into
the
most
vital
problems
of
humanity
in
all
its
stages
the
naive
guesses
of
the
childhood
the
opening
conceptions
of
its
youth
the
more
fully
rounded
beliefs
of
its
maturity
these
books
no
matter
how
unhistorical
in
parts
and
at
times
are
profoundly
true
they
mirror
the
evolution
of
man
loftiest
aspirations
hopes

consolations
and
enthusiasms
his
hates
and
fears
his
views
of
his
origin
and
destiny
his
theories
of
his
rights
and
duties
and
these
not
merely
in
their
lights
but
in
their
shadows
therefore
it
is
that
they
contain
the
germs
of
truths
most
necessary
in
the
evolution
of
humanity
and
give
to
these
germs
the
environment
and
sustenance
which
best
insure
their
growth
and
strength
with
wide
differences
in
origin
and
character
this
sacred
literature
has
been
developed
and
has
exercised
its
influence
in
obedience
to
certain
general
laws
first
of
these
in
time
if
not
in
importance
is
that
which
governs
its
origin
in
all
civilizations
we
find
that
the
divine
spirit
working
in
the
mind
of
man
shapes
his
sacred
books
first
of
all
out
of
the
chaos
of
myth
and
legend
and
of
these
books
when
life
is
thus
breathed
into
them
the
fittest
survive
so
broad
and
dense
is
this
atmosphere
of
myth
and
legend
enveloping
them
that
it
lingers
about
them
after
they
have
been
brought
forth
and
sometimes
from
it
are
even
produced
secondary
mythical
and
legendary
concretions
satellites
about
these
greater
orbs
of
early
thought
of
these
secondary
growths
one
may
be
mentioned
as
showing
how
rich
in
material
was
the
atmosphere
which
enveloped
our
own
earlier
sacred
literature
in
the
third
century
before
christ
there
began
to
be
elaborated
among
the
jewish
scholars
of
alexandria
then
the
great
centre
of
human
thought
a
greek
translation
of
the
main
books
constituting
the
old
testament
nothing
could
be
more
natural
at
that
place
and
time
than
such
a
translation
yet
the
growth
of
explanatory
myth
and
legend
around
it
was
none
the
less
luxuriant
there
was
indeed
a
twofold
growth
among
the
jews
favourable
to
the
new
version
a
legend
rose
which
justified
it
this
legend
in
its
first
stage
was
to
the
effect
that
the
ptolemy
then
on
the
egyptian
throne
had
at
the
request
of
his
chief
librarian
sent
to
jerusalem
for
translators
that
the
jewish
high
priest
eleazar
had
sent
to
the
king
a
most
precious
copy
of
the
scriptures
from
the
temple
at
jerusalem
and
six
most
venerable
devout
and
learned
scholars
from
each
of
the
twelve
tribes
of
israel
that
the
number
of
translators
thus
corresponded
with
the
mysterious
appellations
of
god
and
that
the
combined
efforts
of
these
men
produced
a
marvellously
perfect
translation
but
in
that
atmosphere
of
myth
and
marvel
the
legend
continued
to
grow
and
soon
we
have
it
blooming
forth
yet
more
gorgeously
in
the
statement
that
king
ptolemy
ordered
each
of
the
to
make
by
himself
a
full
translation
of
the
entire
old
testament
and
shut
up
each
translator
in
a
separate
cell
on
the
island
of
pharos
secluding
him
there
until
the
work
was
done
that
the
work
of
each
was
completed
in
exactly
days
and
that
when
at
the
end
of
the
days
the
translations
were
compared
each
was
found
exactly
like
all
the
others
this
showed
clearly
jehovah
approval
but
out
of
all
this
myth
and
legend
there
was
also
evolved
an
account
of
a
very
different
sort
the
jews
who
remained
faithful
to
the
traditions
of
their
race
regarded
this
greek
version
as
a
profanation
and
therefore
there
grew
up
the
legend
that
on
the
completion
of
the
work
there
was
darkness
over
the
whole
earth
during
three
days
this
showed
clearly
jehovah
disapproval
these
legends
which
arose
within
what
as
compared
with
any
previous
time
was
an
exceedingly
enlightened
period
and
which
were
steadfastly
believed
by
a
vast
multitude
of
jews
and
christians
for
ages
are
but
single
examples
among
scores
which
show
how
inevitably
such
traditions
regarding
sacred
books
are
developed
in
the

as
the
second
of
these
laws
governing
the
evolution
of
sacred
literature
may
be
mentioned
that
which
we
have
constantly
seen
so
effective
in
the
growth
of
theological
ideas
that
to
which
comte
gave
the
name
of
the
law
of
wills
and
causes
obedient
to
this
man
attributes
to
the
supreme
being
a
physical
intellectual
and
moral
structure
like
his
own
hence
it
is
that
the
votary
of
each
of
the
great
world
religions
ascribes
to
its
sacred
books
what
he
considers
absolute
perfection
he
imagines
them
to
be
what
he
himself
would
give
the
world
were
he
himself
infinitely
good
wise
and
powerful
a
very
simple
analogy
might
indeed
show
him
that
even
a
literature
emanating
from
an
beneficent
and
powerful
author
might
not
seem
perfect
when
judged
by
a
human
standard
for
he
has
only
to
look
about
him
in
the
world
to
find
that
the
work
which
he
attributes
to
an
and
creator
is
by
no
means
free
from
evil
and
wrong
but
this
analogy
long
escapes
him
and
the
exponent
of
each
great
religion
proves
to
his
own
satisfaction
and
to
the
edification
of
his
fellows
that
their
own
sacred
literature
is
absolutely
accurate
in
statement
infinitely
profound
in
meaning
and
miraculously
perfect
in
form
from
these
premises
also
he
arrives
at
the
conclusion
that
his
own
sacred
literature
is
unique
that
no
other
sacred
book
can
have
emanated
from
a
divine
source
and
that
all
others
claiming
to
be
sacred
are
impostures
still
another
law
governing
the
evolution
of
sacred
literature
in
every
great
world
religion
is
that
when
the
books
which
compose
it
are
once
selected
and
grouped
they
come
to
be
regarded
as
a
final
creation
from
which
nothing
can
be
taken
away
and
of
which
even
error
in
form
if
sanctioned
by
tradition
may
not
be
changed
the
working
of
this
law
has
recently
been
seen
on
a
large
scale
a
few
years
since
a
body
of
chosen
scholars
universally
acknowledged
to
be
the
most
fit
for
the
work
undertook
at
the
call
of
christendom
to
revise
the
authorized
english
version
of
the
bible
beautiful
as
was
that
old
version
there
was
abundant
reason
for
a
revision
the
progress
of
biblical
scholarship
had
revealed
multitudes
of
imperfections
and
not
a
few
gross
errors
in
the
work
of
the
early
translators
and
these
if
uncorrected
were
sure
to
bring
the
sacred
volume
into
discredit
nothing
could
be
more
reverent
than
the
spirit
of
the
revisers
and
the
nineteenth
century
has
known
few
historical
events
of
more
significant
and
touching
beauty
than
the
participation
in
the
holy
communion
by
all
these
scholars
prelates
presbyters
ministers
and
laymen
of
churches
most
widely
differing
in
belief
and
observance
kneeling
side
by
side
at
the
little
altar
in
westminster
abbey
nor
could
any
work
have
been
more
conservative
and
cautious
than
theirs
as
far
as
possible
they
preserved
the
old
matter
and
form
with
scrupulous
care
yet
their
work
was
no
sooner
done
than
it
was
bitterly
attacked
and
widely
condemned
to
this
day
it
is
largely
regarded
with
dislike
in
great
britain
in
america
in
australia
the
old
version
with
its
glaring
misconceptions
mistranslations
and
interpolations
is
still
read
in
preference
to
the
new
the
great
body
of
christians
clearly
preferring
the
accustomed
form
of
words
given
by
the
translators
rather
than
a
nearer
approach
to
the
exact
teaching
of
the
holy
ghost
still
another
law
is
that
when
once
a
group
of
sacred
books
has
been
evolved
even
though
the
group
really
be
a
great
library
of
most
dissimilar
works
ranging
in
matter
from
the
hundredth
psalm
to
the
song
of
songs
and
in
manner
from
the
sublimity
of
isaiah
to
the
offhand
of
jonah
all
come
to
be
thought
one
inseparable
mass
of
interpenetrating
parts
every
statement
in
each
fitting
exactly
and
miraculously
into
each
statement
in
every
other
and
each
and
every
one
and
all
together
literally
true
to
fact
and
at
the
same
time
full
of
hidden
meanings
the
working
of
these
and
other
laws
governing
the
evolution
of
sacred
literature
is
very
clearly
seen
in
the
great
rabbinical
schools
which
flourished
at
jerusalem
tiberias
and
elsewhere
after
the
return
of
the
jews
from
the
babylonian
captivity
and
especially
as
we
approach
the
time
of
christ
these
schools
developed
a
subtlety
in
the
study
of
the
old
testament
which
seems
almost
preternatural
the
resultant
system
was
mainly
a
jugglery
with
words
phrases
and
numbers
which
finally
became
a
sacred
science
with
various
recognised
departments
in
which
interpretation
was
carried
on
sometimes
by
attaching
a
numerical
value
to
letters
sometimes
by
interchange
of
letters
from
differently
arranged
alphabets
sometimes
by
the
making
of
new
texts
out
of
the
initial
letters
of
the
old
and
with
subtlety
such
efforts
as
these
culminated
fitly
in
the
rabbinical
declaration
that
each
passage
in
the
law
has
seventy
distinct
meanings
and
that
god
himself
gives
three
hours
every
day
to
their
study
after
this
the
jewish
world
was
prepared
for
anything
and
it
does
not
surprise
us
to
find
such
discoveries
in
the
domain
of
ethical
culture
as
the
doctrine
that
for
inflicting
the
forty
stripes
save
one
upon
those
who
broke
the
law
the
lash
should
be
braided
of
and
and
as
warrant
for
this
construction
of
the
lash
the
text
the
ox
knoweth
his
owner
and
the
ass
his
master
crib
but
israel
doth
not
know
and
as
the
logic
connecting
text
and
lash
the
statement
that
jehovah
evidently
intended
to
command
that
the
men
who
know
not
shall
be
beaten
by
those
animals
whose
knowledge
shames
them
by
such
methods
also
were
revealed
such
historical
treasures
as
that
og
king
of
bashan
escaped
the
deluge
by
wading
after
noah
ark
there
were
indeed
noble
exceptions
to
this
kind
of
teaching
it
can
not
be
forgotten
that
rabbi
hillel
formulated
the
golden
rule
which
had
before
him
been
given
to
the
extreme
orient
by
confucius
and
which
afterward
received
a
yet
more
beautiful
and
positive
emphasis
from
jesus
of
nazareth
but
the
seven
rules
of
interpretation
laid
down
by
hillel
were
multiplied
and
refined
by
men
like
rabbi
ismael
and
rabbi
eleazar
until
they
justified
every
absurd
subtlety
for
a
multitude
of
amusing
examples
of
rabbinical
interpretations

an
eminent
scholar
has
said
that
while
the
letter
of
scripture
became
ossified
in
palestine
it
became
volatilized
at
alexandria
and
the
truth
of
this
remark
was
proved
by
the
alexandrian
jewish
theologians
just
before
the
beginning
of
our
era
this
too
was
in
obedience
to
a
law
of
development
which
is
that
when
literal
interpretation
clashes
with
increasing
knowledge
or
with
progress
in
moral
feeling
theologians
take
refuge
in
mystic
meanings
a
law
which
we
see
working
in
all
great
religions
from
the
brahmans
finding
hidden
senses
in
the
vedas
to
plato
and
the
stoics
finding
them
in
the
greek
myths
and
from
the
sofi
reading
new
meanings
into
the
koran
to
eminent
christian
divines
of
the
nineteenth
century
giving
a
sense
to
some
of
the
plainest
statements
in
the
bible
nothing
is
more
natural
than
all
this
when
naive
statements
of
sacred
writers
in
accord
with
the
ethics
of
early
ages
make
brahma
perform
atrocities
which
would
disgrace
a
pirate
and
jupiter
take
part
in
adventures
worthy
of
don
juan
and
jahveh
practise
trickery
cruelty
and
injustice
which
would
bring
any
civilized
mortal
into
the
criminal
courts
the
invention
of
allegory
is
the
one
means
of
saving
the
divine
authority
as
soon
as
men
reach
higher
planes
of
civilization
the
great
early
master
in
this
evolution
of
allegory
for
the
satisfaction
of
jews
and
christians
was
philo
by
him
its
use
came
in
as
never
before
the
four
streams
of
the
garden
of
eden
thus
become
the
four
virtues
abraham
country
and
kindred
from
which
he
was
commanded
to
depart
the
human
body
and
its
members
the
five
cities
of
sodom
the
five
senses
the
euphrates
correction
of
manners
by
philo
and
his
compeers
even
the
most
insignificant
words
and
phrases
and
those
especially
were
held
to
conceal
the
most
precious
meanings
a
perfectly
natural
and
logical
result
of
this
view
was
reached
when
philo
saturated
as
he
was
with
greek
culture
and
nourished
on
pious
traditions
of
the
utterances
at
delphi
and
dodona
spoke
reverently
of
the
jewish
scriptures
as
oracles
oracles
they
became
as
oracles
they
appeared
in
the
early
history
of
the
christian
church
and
oracles
they
remained
for
centuries
eternal
life
or
death
infinite
happiness
or
agony
as
well
as
ordinary
justice
in
this
world
being
made
to
depend
on
shifting
interpretations
of
a
long
series
of
dark
and
doubtful
utterances
interpretations
frequently
given
by
men
who
might
have
been
prophets
and
apostles
but
who
had
become
simply
pressing
these
oracles
into
the
service
of
science
philo
became
the
forerunner
of
that
long
series
of
theologians
who
from
augustine
and
cosmas
to
gladstone
have
attempted
to
extract
from
scriptural
myth
and
legend
profound
contributions
to
natural
science
thus
he
taught
that
the
golden
candlesticks
in
the
tabernacle
symbolized
the
planets
the
high
priest
robe
the
universe
and
the
bells
upon
it
the
harmony
of
earth
and
water
whatever
that
may
mean
so
cosmas
taught
a
thousand
years
later
that
the
table
of
shewbread
in
the
tabernacle
showed
forth
the
form
and
construction
of
the
world
and
gladstone
hinted
more
than
a
thousand
years
later
still
that
neptune
trident
had
a
mysterious
connection

typical

clear
prophecy

he
lessened
any

involved
in

it
really
means
is
that
jesus
gave
mankind
a

means
of
the
law
and
philosophy
because
as
he
says
barley

ripens
sooner

but
the
instrument
in
exegesis
which
was
used
with
most
cogent
force
was
the
occult
significance
of
certain
numbers
the
chaldean
and
egyptian
researches
of
our
own
time
have
revealed
the
main
source
of
this
line
of
thought
the
speculations
of
plato
upon
it
are
well
known
but
among
the
jews
and
in
the
early
church
it
grew
into
something
far
beyond
the
wildest
imaginings
of
the
priests
of
memphis
and
babylon
philo
had
found
for
the
elucidation
of
scripture
especially
deep
meanings
in
the
numbers
four
six
and
seven
but
other
interpreters
soon
surpassed
him
at
the
very
outset
this
occult
power
was
used
in
ascertaining
the
canonical
books
of
scripture
josephus
argued
that
since
there
were
letters
in
the
hebrew
alphabet
there
must
be
sacred
books
in
the
old
testament
other
jewish
authorities
thought
that
there
should
be
books
on
account
of
the
watches
in
the
temple
jerome
wavered
between
the
argument
based
upon
the
letters
in
the
hebrew
alphabet
and
that
suggested
by
the
elders
in
the
apocalypse
hilary
of
poitiers
argued
that
there
must
be
books
on
account
of
the
letters

the
greek
alphabet
origen
found
an
argument
for
the
existence
of
exactly
four
gospels
in
the
existence
of
just
four
elements
irenaeus
insisted
that
there
could
be
neither
more
nor
fewer
than
four
gospels
since
the
earth
has
four
quarters
the
air
four
winds
and
the
cherubim
four
faces
and
he
denounced
those
who
declined
to
accept
this
reasoning
as

during
the
first
half
of

came
one
who
exercised
a
still
stronger
influence
in

direction
a
great
man
who

rendering
precious
services
did
more
than

to
fasten

a
system
which
has
been
one
of
its
heaviest
burdens
for
more
than
sixteen
hundred
years
this
was
origen
yet
his
purpose
was
noble
and
his
work
based
on
profound
thought
he
had
to
meet
the
leading
philosophers
of
the
pagan
world
to
reply
to
their
arguments
against
the
old
testament
and
especially
to
break
the
force
of
their
taunts
against
its
imputation
of
human
form
limitations
passions
weaknesses
and
even
immoralities
to
the
almighty
starting
with
a
mistaken
translation
of
a
verse
in
the
book
of
proverbs
origen
presented
as
a
basis
for
his
main
structure
the
idea
of
a
threefold
sense
of
scripture
the
literal
the
moral
and
the
mystic
corresponding
to
the
platonic
conception
of
the
threefold
nature
of
man
as
results
of
this
we
have
such
masterpieces
as
his
proof
from
the
fifth
verse
of
chapter
xxv
of
job
that
the
stars
are
living
beings
and
from
the
passage
in
the
nineteenth
chapter
of
matthew
his
warrant
for
but
his
great
triumphs
were
in
the
allegorical
method
by
its
use
the
bible
was
speedily
made
an
oracle
indeed
or
rather
a
book
of
riddles
a
list
of
kings
in
the
old
testament
thus
becomes
an
enumeration
of
sins
the
waterpots
of
stone
containing
two
or
three
firkins
apiece
at
the
marriage
of
cana
signify
the
literal
moral
and
spiritual
sense
of
scripture
the
ass
upon
which
the
saviour
rode
on
his
triumphal
entry
into
jerusalem
becomes
the
old
testament
the
foal
the
new
testament
and
the
two
apostles
who
went
to
loose
them
the
moral
and
mystical
senses
blind
bartimeus
throwing
off
his
coat
while
hastening
to
jesus
opens
a
whole
treasury
of
oracular
meanings
the
genius
and
power
of
origen
made
a
great
impression
on
the
strong
thinkers
who
followed
him
jerome
called
him
the
greatest
master
in
the
church
since
the
apostles
and
athanasius
was
hardly
less
emphatic
the
structure
thus
begun
was
continued
by
leading
theologians
during
the
centuries
following
hilary
of
poitiers
the
athanasius
of
gaul
produced
some
wonderful
results
of
this
method
but
jerome
inspired
by
the
example
of
the
man
whom
he
so
greatly
admired
went
beyond
him
a
triumph
of
his
exegesis
is
seen
in
his
statement
that
the
shunamite
damsel
who
was
selected
to
cherish
david
in
his
old
age
signified
heavenly
wisdom
the
great
mind
of
augustine
was
drawn
largely
into
this
kind
of
creation
and
nothing
marks
more
clearly
the
vast
change
which
had
come
over
the
world
than
the
fact
that
this
greatest
of
the
early
christian
thinkers
turned
from
the
broader
paths
opened
by
plato
and
aristotle
into
that
opened
by
clement
of
alexandria
in
the
mystic
power
of
numbers
to
reveal
the
sense
of
scripture
augustine
found
especial
delight
he
tells
us
that
there
is
deep
meaning
in
sundry
scriptural
uses
of
the
number
forty
and
especially
as
the
number
of
days
required
for
fasting
forty
he
reminds
us
is
four
times
ten
now
four
he
says
is
the
number
especially
representing
time
the
day
and
the
year
being
each
divided
into
four
parts
while
ten
being
made
up
of
three
and
seven
represents
knowledge
of
the
creator
and
creature
three
referring
to
the
three
persons
in
the
triune
creator
and
seven
referring
to
the
three
elements
heart
soul
and
mind
taken
in
connection
with
the
four
elements
fire
air
earth
and
water
which
go
to
make
up
the
creature
therefore
this
number
ten
representing
knowledge
being
multiplied
by
four
representing
time
admonishes
us
to
live
during
time
according
to
knowledge
that
is
to
fast
for
forty
days
referring
to
such
misty
methods
as
these
which
lead
the
reader
to
ask
himself
whether
he
is
sleeping
or
waking
augustine
remarks
that
ignorance
of
numbers
prevents
us
from
understanding
such
things
in
scripture
but
perhaps
the
most
amazing
example
is
to
be
seen
in
his
notes
on
the
hundred
and
fifty
and
three
fishes
which
according
to
john
gospel
were
caught
by
peter
and
the
other
apostles
some
points
in
his
long
development
of
this
subject
may
be
selected
to
show
what
the
older
theological
method
could
be
made
to
do
for
a
great
mind
he
tells
us
that
the
hundred
and
fifty
and
three
fishes
embody
a
mystery
that
the
number
ten
evidently
as
the
number
of
the
commandments
indicates
the
law
but
as
the
law
without
the
spirit
only
kills
we
must
add
the
seven
gifts
of
the
spirit
and
we
thus
have
the
number
seventeen
which
signifies
the
old
and
new
dispensations
then
if
we
add
together
every
several
number
which
seventeen
contains
from
one
to
seventeen
inclusive
the
result
is
a
hundred
and
fifty
and
three
the
number
of
the
fishes
with
this
sort
of
reasoning
he
finds
profound
meanings
in
the
number
of
furlongs
mentioned
in
he
sixth
chapter
of
john
referring
to
the
fact
that
the
disciples
had
rowed
about
or
thirty
furlongs
he
declares
that
typifies
the
law
because
it
is
five
times
five
but
the
law
was
imperfect
before
the
gospel
came
now
perfection
is
comprised
in
six
since
god
in
six
days
perfected
the
world
hence
five
is
multiplied
by
six
that
the
law
may
be
perfected
by
the
gospel
and
six
times
five
is
thirty
but
augustine
exploits
in
exegesis
were
not
all
based
on
numerals
he
is
sometimes
equally
profound
in
other
modes
thus
he
tells
us
that
the
condemnation
of
the
serpent
to
eat
dust
typifies
the
sin
of
curiosity
since
in
eating
dust
he
penetrates
the
obscure
and
shadowy
and
that
noah
ark
was
pitched
within
and
without
with
pitch
to
show
the
safety
of
the
church
from
the
leaking
in
of
heresy
still
another
exploit
one
at
which
the
church
might
well
have
stood
aghast
was
his
statement
that
the
drunkenness
of
noah
prefigured
the
suffering
and
death
of
christ
it
is
but
just
to
say
that
he
was
not
the
original
author
of
this
interpretation
it
had
been
presented
long
before
by
cyprian
but
this
was
far
from
augustine
worst
perhaps
no
interpretation
of
scripture
has
ever
led
to
more
cruel
and
persistent
oppression
torture
and
bloodshed
than
his
reading
into
one
of
the
most
beautiful
parables
of
jesus
of
nazareth
into
the
words
compel
them
to
come
in
a
warrant
for
religious
persecution
of
all
unintended
blasphemies
since
the
world
began
possibly
the
most
appalling
another
strong
man
follows
to
fasten
these
methods
on
the
church
gregory
the
great
in
his
renowned
work
on
the
book
of
job
the
magna
moralia
given
to
the
world
at
the
end
of
the
sixth
century
he
lays
great
stress
on
the
deep
mystical
meanings
of
the
statement
that
job
had
seven
sons
he
thinks
the
seven
sons
typify
the
twelve
apostles
for
the
apostles
were
selected
through
the
sevenfold
grace
of
the
spirit
moreover
twelve
is
produced
from
seven
that
is
the
two
parts
of
seven
four
and
three
when
multiplied
together
give
twelve
he
also
finds
deep
significance
in
the
number
of
the
apostles
this
number
being
evidently
determined
by
a
multiplication
of
the
number
of
persons
in
the
trinity
by
the
number
of
quarters
of
the
globe
still
to
do
him
justice
it
must
be
said
that
in
some
parts
of
his
exegesis
the
strong
sense
which
was
one
of
his
most
striking
characteristics
crops
out
in
a
way
very
refreshing
thus
referring
to
a
passage
in
the
first
chapter
of
job
regarding
the
oxen
which
were
ploughing
and
the
asses
which
were
feeding
beside
them
he
tells
us
pithily
that
these
typify
two
classes
of
christians
the
oxen
the
energetic
christians
who
do
the
work
of
the
church
the
asses
the
lazy
christians
who
merely
feed

thus
began
the
vast
theological
structure
of
oracular
interpretation
applied
to
the
bible
as
we
have
seen
the
men
who
prepared
the
ground
for
it
were
the
rabbis
of
palestine
and
the
hellenized
jews
of
alexandria
and
the
four
great
men
who
laid
its
foundation
courses
were
origen
augustine
jerome
and
gregory
during
the
ten
centuries
following
the
last
of
these
men
this
structure
continued
to
rise
steadily
above
the
plain
meanings
of
scripture
the
christian
world
rejoiced
in
it
and
the
few
great
thinkers
who
dared
bring
the
truth
to
bear
upon
it
were
rejected
it
did
indeed
seem
at
one
period
in
the
early
church
that
a
better
system
might
be
developed
the
school
of
antioch
especially
as
represented
by
chrysostom
appeared
likely
to
lead
in
this
better
way
but
the
dominant
forces
were
too
strong
the
passion
for
myth
and
marvel
prevailed
over
the
love
of
real
knowledge
and
the
reasonings
of
chrysostom
and
his
compeers
were
neglected
for
the
work
of
the
school
of
antioch
and
especially
of
chrysostom
see
the
eloquent
tribute
to
it
by
farrar
as
above
in
the
ninth
century
came
another
effort
to
present
the
claims
of
right
reason
the
first
man
prominent
in
this
was
agobard
bishop
of
lyons
whom
an
eminent
historian
has
well
called
the
clearest
head
of
his
time
with
the
same
insight
which
penetrated
the
fallacies
and
follies
of
image
worship
belief
in
witchcraft
persecution
the
ordeal
and
the
judicial
duel
he
saw
the
futility
of
this
vast
fabric
of
interpretation
protested
against
the
idea
that
the
divine
spirit
extended
its
inspiration
to
the
mere
words
of
scripture
and
asked
a
question
which
has
resounded
through
every
generation
since
if
you
once
begin
such
a
system
who
can
measure
the
absurdity
which
will
follow
during
the
same
century
another
opponent
of
this
dominant
system
appeared
john
scotus
erigena
he
contended
that
reason
and
authority
come
alike
from
the
one
source
of
divine
wisdom
that
the
fathers
great
as
their
authority
is
often
contradict
each
other
and
that
in
last
resort
reason
must
be
called
in
to
decide
between
them
but
the
evolution
of
unreason
continued
agobard
was
unheeded
and
erigena
placed
under
the
ban
by
two
councils
his
work
being
condemned
by
a
synod
as
a
commentum
diaboli
four
centuries
later
honorius
iii
ordered
it
to
be
burned
as
teeming
with
the
venom
of
hereditary
depravity
and
finally
after
eight
centuries
pope
gregory
xiii
placed
it
on
the
index
where
with
so
many
other
works
which
have
done
good
service
to
humanity
it
remains
to
this
day
nor
did
abelard
who
three
centuries
after
agobard
and
erigena
made
an
attempt
in
some
respects
like
theirs
have
any
better
success
his
fate
at
the
hands
of
bernard
and
the
council
of
sens
the
world
knows
by
heart
far
more
consonant
with
the
spirit
of
the
universal
church
was
the
teaching
in
the
twelfth
century
of
the
great
hugo
of
victor
conveyed
in
these
ominous
words
learn
first
what
is
to
be
believed
disce
primo
quod
credendum
est
meaning
thereby
that
one
should
first
accept
doctrines
and
then
find
texts
to
confirm
them
these
principles
being
dominant
the
accretions
to
the
enormous
fabric
of
interpretation
went
steadily
on
typical
is
the
fact
that
the
venerable
bede
contributed
to
it
the
doctrine
that
in
the
text
mentioning
elkanah
and
his
two
wives
elkanah
means
christ
and
the
two
wives
the
synagogue
and
the
church
even
such
men
as
alfred
the
great
and
thomas
aquinas
were
added
to
the
forces
at
work
in
building
above
the
sacred
books
this
prodigious
structure
of
sophistry
perhaps
nothing
shows
more
clearly
the
tenacity
of
the
old
system
of
interpretation
than
the
sermons
of
savonarola
during
the
last
decade
of
the
fifteenth
century
just
at
the
close
of
the
medieval
period
he
was
engaged
in
a
struggle
at
florence
no
man
ever
preached
more
powerfully
the
gospel
of
righteousness
none
ever
laid
more
stress
on
conduct
even
luther
was
not
more
zealous
for
reform
or
more
careless
of
tradition
and
yet
we
find
the
great
florentine
apostle
and
martyr
absolutely
tied
fast
to
the
old
system
of
allegorical
interpretation
the
autograph
notes
of
his
sermons
still
preserved
in
his
cell
at
san
marco
show
this
abundantly
thus
we
find
him
attaching
to
the
creation
of
grasses
and
plants
on
the
third
day
an
allegorical
connection
with
the
multitude
of
the
elect
and
with
the
sound
doctrines
of
the
church
and
to
the
creation
of
land

the
revival
of
learning
in
the
fifteenth
century
seemed
likely
to
undermine
this
older
structure
then
it
was
that
lorenzo
valla
brought
to
bear
on
biblical
research
for
the
first
time
the
spirit
of
modern
criticism
by
truly
scientific
methods
he
proved
the
famous
letter
of
christ
to
abgarus
a
forgery
the
donation
of
constantine
one
of
the
great
foundations
of
the
ecclesiastical
power
in
temporal
things
a
fraud
and
the
creed
a
creation
which
the
apostles
by
several
centuries
of
even
more
permanent
influence
was
his
work
upon
the
new
testament
in
which
he
initiated
the
modern
method
of
comparing
manuscripts
to
find
what
the
sacred
text
really
is
at
an
earlier
or
later
period
he
would
doubtless
have
paid
for
his
temerity
with
his
life
fortunately
just
at
that
time
the
ruling
pontiff
and
his
contemporaries
cared
much
for
literature
and
little
for
orthodoxy
and
from
their
palaces
he
could
bid
defiance
to
the
inquisition
while
valla
thus
initiated
biblical
criticism
south
of
the
alps
a
much
greater
man
began
a
more
fruitful
work
in
northern
europe
erasmus
with
his
edition
of
the
new
testament
stands
at
the
source
of
that
great
stream
of
modern
research
and
thought
which
is
doing
so
much
to
undermine
and
dissolve
away
the
vast
fabric
of
patristic
and
scholastic
interpretation
yet
his
efforts
to
purify
the
scriptural
text
seemed
at
first
to
encounter
insurmountable
difficulties
and
one
of
these
may
stimulate
reflection
he
had
found
what
some
others
had
found
before
him
that
the
famous
verse
in
the
fifth
chapter
of
the
first
epistle
general
of
john
regarding
the
three
witnesses
was
an
interpolation
careful
research
through
all
the
really
important
early
manuscripts
showed
that
it
appeared
in
none
of
them
even
after
the
bible
had
been
corrected
in
the
eleventh
and
twelfth
centuries
by
lanfranc
archbishop
of
canterbury
and
by
nicholas
cardinal
and
librarian
of
the
roman
church
in
accordance
with
the
orthodox
faith
the
passage
was
still
wanting
in
the
more
authoritative
latin
manuscripts
there
was
not
the
slightest
tenable
ground
for
believing
in
the
authenticity
of
the
text
on
the
contrary
it
has
been
demonstrated
that
after
a
universal
silence
of
the
orthodox
fathers
of
the
church
of
the
ancient
versions
of
the
scriptures
and
of
all
really
important
manuscripts
the
verse
first
appeared
in
a
confession
of
faith
drawn
up
by
an
obscure
zealot
toward
the
end
of
the
fifth
century
in
a
very
mild
exercise
then
of
critical
judgment
erasmus
omitted
this
text
from
the
first
two
editions
of
his
greek
testament
as
evidently
spurious
a
storm
arose
at
once
in
england
lee
afterward
archbishop
of
york
in
spain
stunica
one
of
the
editors
of
the
complutensian
polyglot
and
in
france
bude
syndic
of
the
sorbonne
together
with
a
vast
army
of
monks
in
england
and
on
the
continent
attacked
him
ferociously
he
was
condemned
by
the
university
of
paris
and
various
propositions
of
his
were
declared
to
be
heretical
and
impious
fortunately
the
worst
persecutors
could
not
reach
him
otherwise
they
might
have
treated
him
as
they
treated
his
disciple
berquin
whom
in
they
burned
at
paris
the
fate
of
this
spurious
text
throws
light
into
the
workings
of
human
nature
in
its
relations
to
sacred
literature
although
luther
omitted
it
from
his
translation
of
the
new
testament
and
kept
it
out
of
every
copy
published
during
his
lifetime
and
although
at
a
later
period
the
most
eminent
christian
scholars
showed
that
it
had
no
right
to
a
place
in
the
bible
it
was
after
luther
death
replaced
in
the
german
translation
and
has
been
incorporated
into
all
important
editions
of
it
save
one
since
the
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
century
so
essential
was
it
found
in
maintaining
the
dominant
theology
that
despite
the
fact
that
sir
isaac
newton
richard
porson
the
revisers
and
all
other
eminent
authorities
have
rejected
it
the
anglican
church
still
retains
it
in
its
lectionary
and
the
scotch
church
continues
to
use
it
in
the
westminster
catechism
as
a
main
support
of
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
nor
were
other
new
truths
presented
by
erasmus
better
received
his
statement
that
some
of
the
epistles
ascribed
to
paul
are
certainly
not
his
which
is
universally
acknowledged
as
a
truism
also
aroused
a
storm
for
generations
then
his
work
seemed
vain
on
the
coming
in
of
the
reformation
the
great
structure
of
belief
in
the
literal
and
historical
correctness
of
every
statement
in
the
scriptures
in
the
profound
allegorical
meanings
of
the
simplest
texts
and
even
in
the
divine
origin
of
the
vowel
punctuation
towered
more
loftily
and
grew
more
rapidly
than
ever
before
the
reformers
having
cast
off
the
authority
of
the
pope
and
of
the
universal
church
fell
back
all
the
more
upon
the
infallibility
of
the
sacred
books
the
attitude
of
luther
toward
this
great
subject
was
characteristic
as
a
rule
he
adhered
tenaciously
to
the
literal
interpretation
of
the
scriptures
his
argument
against
copernicus
is
a
fair
example
of
his
reasoning
in
this
respect
but
with
the
strong
good
sense
which
characterized
him
he
from
time
to
time
broke
away
from
the
received
belief
thus
he
took
the
liberty
of
understanding
certain
passages
in
the
old
testament
in
a
different
sense
from
that
given
them
by
the
new
testament
and
declared
paul
allegorical
use
of
the
story
of
sarah
and
hagar
too
unsound
to
stand
the
test
he
also
emphatically
denied
that
the
epistle
to
the
hebrews
was
written
by
paul
and
he
did
this
in
the
exercise
of
a
critical
judgment
upon
internal
evidence
his
utterance
as
to
the
epistle
of
james
became
famous
he
announced
to
the
church
i
do
not
esteem
this
an
apostolic
epistle
i
will
not
have
it
in
my
bible
among
the
canonical
books
and
he
summed
up
his
opinion
in
his
allusion
to
it
as
an
epistle
of
straw
emboldened
by
him
the
gentle
spirit
of
melanchthon
while
usually
taking
the
bible
very
literally
at
times
revolted
but
this
was
not
due
to
any
want
of
loyalty
to
the
old
method
of
interpretation
whenever
the
wildest
and
most
absurd
system
of
exegesis
seemed
necessary
to
support
any
part
of
the
reformed
doctrine
luther
and
melanchthon
unflinchingly
developed
it
both
of
them
held
firmly
to
the
old
dictum
of
hugo
of
victor
which
as
we
have
seen
was
virtually
that
one
must
first
accept
the
doctrine
and
then
find
scriptural
warrant
for
it
very
striking
examples
of
this
were
afforded
in
the
interpretation
by
luther
and
melanchthon
of
certain
alleged
marvels
of
their
time
and
one
out
of
several
of
these
may
be
taken
as
typical
of
their
methods
in
luther
and
melanchthon
jointly
published
a
work
under
the
title
der
papstesel
interpreting
the
significance
of
a
strange
monster
which
according
to
a
popular
story
had
been
found
floating
in
the
tiber
some
time
before
this
book
was
illustrated
by
startling
pictures
and
both
text
and
pictures
were
devoted
to
proving
that
this
monster
was
a
sign
from
god
indicating
the
doom
of
the
papacy
this
treatise
by
the
two
great
founders
of
german
protestantism
pointed
out
that
the
ass
head
signified
the
pope
himself
for
said
they
as
well
as
an
ass
head
is
suited
to
a
human
body
so
well
is
the
pope
suited
to
be
head
over
the
church
this
argument
was
clinched
by
a
reference
to
exodus
the
right
hand
of
the
monster
said
to
be
like
an
elephant
foot
they
made
to
signify
the
spiritual
rule
of
the
pope
since
with
it
he
tramples
upon
all
the
weak
this
they
proved
from
the
book
of
daniel
and
the
second
epistle
to
timothy
the
monster
left
hand
which
was
like
the
hand
of
a
man
they
declared
to
mean
the
secular
rule
and
they
found
passages
to
support
this
view
in
daniel
and
luke
the
right
foot
which
was
like
the
foot
of
an
ox
they
declared
to
typify
the
servants
of
the
spiritual
power
and
proved
this
by
a
citation
from
matthew
the
left
foot
like
a
griffin
claw
they
made
to
typify
the
servants
of
the
temporal
power
of
the
pope
and
the
highly
developed
breasts
and
various
other
members
cardinals
bishops
priests
and
monks
whose
life
is
eating
drinking
and
unchastity
to
prove
this
they
cited
passages
from
second
timothy
and
philippians
the
alleged
on
the
arms
legs
and
neck
of
the
monster
they
made
to
typify
secular
princes
and
lords
since
as
they
said
in
matthew
and
job
the
sea
typifies
the
world
and
fishes
men
the
old
man
head
at
the
base
of
the
monster
spine
they
interpreted
to
mean
the
abolition
and
end
of
the
papacy
and
proved
this
from
hebrews
and
daniel
the
dragon
which
opens
his
mouth
in
the
rear
and
vomits
fire
refers
to
the
terrible
virulent
bulls
and
books
which
the
pope
and
his
minions
are
now
vomiting
forth
into
the
world
the
two
great
reformers
then
went
on
to
insist
that
since
this
monster
was
found
at
rome
it
could
refer
to
no
person
but
the
pope
for
they
said
god
always
sends
his
signs
in
the
places
where
their
meaning
applies
finally
they
assured
the
world
that
the
monster
in
general
clearly
signified
that
the
papacy
was
then
near
its
end
to
this
development
of
interpretation
luther
and
melanchthon
especially
devoted
themselves
the
latter
by
revising
this
exposition
of
the
prodigy
and
the
former
by
making
additions
to
a
new
edition
such
was
the
success
of
this
kind
of
interpretation
that
luther
hearing
that
a
monstrous
calf
had
been
found
at
freiburg
published
a
treatise
upon
it
showing
by
citations
from
the
books
of
exodus
kings
the
psalms
isaiah
daniel
and
the
gospel
of
john
that
this
new
monster
was
the
especial
work
of
the
devil
but
full
of
meaning
in
regard
to
the
questions
at
issue
between
the
reformers
and
the
older
church
the
other
main
branch
of
the
reformed
church
appeared
for
a
time
to
establish
a
better
system
calvin
strong
logic
seemed
at
one
period
likely
to
tear
his
adherents
away
from
the
older
method
but
the
evolution
of
scholasticism
continued
and
the
influence
of
the
german
reformers
prevailed
at
every
theological
centre
came
an
amazing
development
of
interpretation
eminent
lutheran
divines
in
the
seventeenth
century
like
gerhard
calovius
coccerus
and
multitudes
of
others
wrote
scores
of
quartos
to
further
this
system
and
the
other
branch
of
the
protestant
church
emulated
their
example
the
pregnant
dictum
of
augustine
greater
is
the
authority
of
scripture
than
all
human
capacity
was
steadily
insisted
upon
and
toward
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century
voetius
the
renowned
professor
at
utrecht
declared
not
a
word
is
contained
in
the
holy
scriptures
which
is
not
in
the
strictest
sense
inspired
the
very
punctuation
not
excepted
and
this
declaration
was
echoed
back
from
multitudes
of
pulpits
theological
chairs
synods
and
councils
unfortunately
it
was
very
difficult
to
find
what
the
authority
of
scripture
really
was
to
the
greater
number
of
protestant
ecclesiastics
it
meant
the
authority
of
any
meaning
in
the
text
which
they
had
the
wit
to
invent
and
the
power
to
enforce
to
increase
this
vast
confusion
came
in
the
older
branch
of
the
church
the
idea
of
the
divine
inspiration
of
the
latin
translation
of
the
bible
ascribed
to
jerome
the
vulgate
it
was
insisted
by
leading
catholic
authorities
that
this
was
as
completely
a
product
of
divine
inspiration
as
was
the
hebrew
original
strong
men
arose
to
insist
even
that
where
the
hebrew
and
the
latin
differed
the
hebrew
should
be
altered
to
fit
jerome
mistranslation
as
the
latter
having
been
made
under
the
new
dispensation
must
be
better
than
that
made

have
wrought
so
strongly
against

revision
of

acted
even
more
forcibly
against
that
revision
in

seventeenth
century
straightway
great
masses
of
the
people
led
by
monks
and
parish
priests
rose
in
revolt
the
fact
that
the
revisers
had
written
in
the
new
testament
the
name
of
jesus
correctly
instead
of
following
the
old
wrong
orthography
aroused
the
wildest
fanaticism
the
monks
of

convent
of

when
the

books
were
sent
them
cried
in
terror
woe
woe

until
after
a
struggle
lasting
seven
years
their
monastery
was
besieged
and
taken
by
an
imperial
army
hence
arose
the
great
sect
of
the
old
believers
lasting
to
this
day
and
fanatically
devoted
to
the
corrupt
readings
of
the
old
text

members

the
sect
of
old
believers
which
dates
from
the
reform
of
nikon
nothing
could
exceed
the
fervor
with
which
this
venerable
man
standing
in
the
chapel
of
his
superb
villa
expatiated
on
the
horrors
of
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
with
three
fingers
instead
of
two
his
argument
was
that
the
two
fingers
as
used
by
the
old
believers
typify
the
divine
and
human
nature
of
our
lord
and
hence
that
the
use
of
them
is
strictly
correct
whereas
signing
with
three
fingers
representing
the
blessed
trinity
is
virtually
to
crucify
all
three
persons
of
the
godhead
afresh
not
less
cogent
were
his
arguments
regarding
the
immense
value
of
the
old
text
of
scripture

at

in

his
power
appears
from

evidence
he
not

discarded
the
text
of
the

he
decided
that
the
pentateuch
must
have
been
made
up
from
several
books
that
genesis
was
not
written
until
the
reign
of
saul
that
the
books
of
kings
and
chronicles
were
probably
collected
by
ezra
and
in
a
curious
anticipation
of
modern
criticism
that
the
book
of
psalms
and
the
prophecies
of
isaiah
and
daniel
were
each
written
by
various
authors
at
various
dates
but
the
old
belief
in
prophecy
as
prediction
was
too
strong
for
him
and
we
find
him
applying
his
great
powers
to
the
relation
of
the
details
given
by
the
prophets
and
in
the
apocalypse
to
the
history
of
mankind
since
unrolled
and
tracing
from
every
statement
in
prophetic
literature
its
exact
fulfilment
even
in
the
most
minute
particulars
by
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
structure
of
scriptural
interpretation
had
become
enormous
it
seemed
destined
to
hide
forever
the
real
character
of
our
sacred
literature
and
to
obscure
the
great
light
which
christianity
had
brought
into
the
world
the
church
eastern
and
western
catholic
and
protestant
was
content
to
sit
in
its
shadow
and
the
great
divines
of
all
branches
of
the
church
reared
every
sort
of
fantastic
buttress
to
strengthen
or
adorn
it
it
seemed
to
be
founded
for
eternity
and
yet
at
this
very
time
when
it
appeared
the
strongest
a
current
of
thought
was
rapidly
dissolving
away
its
foundations
and
preparing
that
wreck
and
ruin
of
the
whole
fabric
which
is
now
at
the
close
of
the
nineteenth
century
going
on
so
rapidly
the
account
of
the
movement
thus
begun
is
next

boldness
in

criticism

beginnings
of
scientific
interpretation
at
the
base
of
the
vast
structure
of
the
older
scriptural
interpretation
were
certain
ideas
regarding
the
first
five
books
of
the
old
testament
it
was
taken
for
granted
that
they
had
been
dictated
by
the
almighty
to
moses
about
fifteen
hundred
years
before
our
era
that
some
parts
of
them
indeed
had
been
written
by
the
corporeal
finger
of
jehovah
and
that
all
parts
gave
not
merely
his
thoughts
but
his
exact
phraseology
it
was
also
held
virtually
by
the
universal
church
that
while
every
narrative
or
statement
in
these
books
is
a
precise
statement
of
historical
or
scientific
fact
yet
that
the
entire
text
contains
vast
hidden
meanings
such
was
the
rule
the
exceptions
made
by
a
few
interpreters
here
and
there
only
confirmed
it
even
the
indifference
of
jerome
to
the
doctrine
of
mosaic
authorship
did
not
prevent
its
ripening
into
a
dogma
the
book
of
genesis
was
universally
held
to
be
an
account
not
only
divinely
comprehensive
but
miraculously
exact
of
the
creation
and
of
the
beginnings
of
life
on
the
earth
an
account
to
which
all
discoveries
in
every
branch
of
science
must
under
pains
and
penalties
be
made
to
conform
in
lands
this
has
lasted
until
our
own
time
the
most
eminent
of
recent
english
biologists
has
told
us
how
in
every
path
of
natural
science
he
has
at
some
stage
in
his
career
come
across
a
barrier
labelled
no
thoroughfare
moses
a
favourite
subject
of
theological
eloquence
was
the
perfection
of
the
pentateuch
and
especially
of
genesis
not
only
as
a
record
of
the
past
but
as
a
revelation
of
the
future
the
culmination
of
this
view
in
the
protestant
church
was
the
pansophia
mosaica
of
pfeiffer
a
lutheran
general
superintendent
or
bishop
in
northern
germany
near
the
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
century
he
declared
that
the
text
of
genesis
must
be
received
strictly
that
it
contains
all
knowledge
human
and
divine
that
articles
of
the
augsburg
confession
are
to
be
found
in
it
that
it
is
an
arsenal
of
arguments
against
all
sects
and
sorts
of
atheists
pagans
jews
turks
tartars
papists
calvinists
socinians
and
baptists
the
source
of
all
sciences
and
arts
including
law
medicine
philosophy
and
rhetoric
the
source
and
essence
of
all
histories
and
of
all
professions
trades
and
works
an
exhibition
of
all
virtues
and
vices
the
origin
of
all
consolation
this
utterance
resounded
through
germany
from
pulpit
to
pulpit
growing
in
strength
and
volume
until
a
century
later
it
was
echoed
back
by
huet
the
eminent
bishop
and
commentator
of
france
he
cited
a
hundred
authors
sacred
and
profane
to
prove
that
moses
wrote
the
pentateuch
and
not
only
this
but
that
from
the
jewish
lawgiver
came
the
heathen
theology
that
moses
was
in
fact
nearly
the
whole
pagan
pantheon
rolled
into
one
and
really
the
being
worshipped

such
names
as

came
so
far
as
the
world
now
knows
the
first
gainsayer
of
this
general
theory
then
it
was
that
aben
ezra
the
greatest
biblical
scholar
of
the
middle
ages
ventured
very
discreetly
to
call
attention
to
certain
points
in
the
pentateuch
incompatible
with
the
belief
that
the
whole
of
it
had
been
written
by
moses
and
handed
down
in
its
original
form
his
opinion
was
based
upon
the
texts
which
have
turned
all
really
eminent
biblical
scholars
in
the
nineteenth
century
from
the
old
view
by
showing
the
mosaic
authorship
of
the
five
books
in
their
present
form
to
be
clearly
disproved
by
the
books
themselves
and
among
these
texts
accounts
of
moses
own
death
and
burial
as
well
as
statements
based
on
names
events
and
conditions
which
only
came
into
being
ages
after
the
time
of
moses
but
aben
ezra
had
evidently
no
aspirations
for
martyrdom
he
fathered
the
idea
upon
a
rabbi
of
a
previous
generation
and
having
veiled
his
statement
in
an
enigma
added
the
caution
let
him
who
understands
hold
his
tongue

the
texts
referred

by

for
about
four
centuries
the
learned
world
followed
the
prudent
advice
and
then
two
noted
scholars
one
of
them
a
protestant
the
other
a
catholic
revived
his
idea
the
first
of
these
carlstadt
insisted
that
the
authorship
of
the
pentateuch
was
unknown
and
unknowable
the
other
andreas
maes
expressed
his
opinion
in
terms
which
would
not
now
offend
the
most
orthodox
that
the
pentateuch
had
been
edited
by
ezra
and
had
received
in
the
process
sundry
divinely
inspired
words
and
phrases
to
clear
the
meaning
both
these
innovators
were
dealt
with
promptly
carlstadt
was
for
this
and
other
troublesome
ideas
suppressed
with
the
applause
of
the
protestant
church
and
the
book
of
maes
was
placed
by
the
older
church
on
the
index
but
as
we
now
look
back
over
the
revival
of
learning
the
age
of
discovery
and
the
reformation
we
can
see
clearly
that
powerful
as
the
older
church
then
was
and
powerful
as
the
reformed
church
was
to
be
there
was
at
work
something
far
more
mighty
than
either
or
than
both
and
this
was
a
great
law
of
nature
the
law
of
evolution
through
differentiation
obedient
to
this
law
there
now
began
to
arise
both
within
the
church
and
without
it
a
new
body
of
scholars
not
so
much
theologians
as
searchers
for
truth
by
scientific
methods
some
like
cusa
were
ecclesiastics
some
like
valla
erasmus
and
the
scaligers
were
not
such
in
any
real
sense
but
whether
in
holy
orders
really
nominally
or
not
at
all
they
were
first
of
all
literary
and
scientific
investigators
during
the
sixteenth
century
a
strong
impulse
was
given
to
more
thorough
research
by
several
very
remarkable
triumphs
of
the
critical
method
as
developed
by
this
new
class
of
men
and
two
of
these
ought
here
to
receive
attention
on
account
of
their
influence
upon
the
whole
after
course
of
human
thought
for
many
centuries
the
decretals
bearing
the
great
name
of
isidore
had
been
cherished
as
among
the
most
valued
muniments
of
the
church
they
contained
what
claimed
to
be
a
mass
of
canons
letters
of
popes
decrees
of
councils
and
the
like
from
the
days
of
the
apostles
down
to
the
eighth
century
all
supporting
at
important
points
the
doctrine
the
discipline
the
ceremonial
and
various
high
claims
of
the
church
and
its
hierarchy
but
in
the
fifteenth
century
that
sturdy
german
thinker
cardinal
nicholas
of
cusa
insisted
on
examining
these
documents
and
on
applying
to
them
the
same
thorough
research
and
patient
thought
which
led
him
even
before
copernicus
to
detect
the
error
of
the
ptolemaic
astronomy
as
a
result
he
avowed
his
scepticism
regarding
this
pious
literature
other
close
thinkers
followed
him
in
investigating
it
and
it
was
soon
found
a
tissue
of
absurd
anachronisms
with
endless
clashing
and
confusion
of
events
and
persons
for
a
time
heroic
attempts
were
made
by
church
authorities
to
cover
up
these
facts
scholars
revealing
them
were
frowned
upon
even
persecuted
and
their
works
placed
upon
the
index
scholars
explaining
them
away
the
apologists
or
reconcilers
of
that
day
were
rewarded
with
church
preferment
one
of
them
securing
for
a
very
feeble
treatise
a
cardinal
hat
but
all
in
vain
these
writings
were
at
length
acknowledged
by
all
scholars
of
note
catholic
and
protestant
to
be
mainly
a
mass
of
devoutly
cunning
forgeries
while
the
eyes
of
scholars
were
thus
opened
as
never
before
to
the
skill
of
early
church
zealots
in
forging
documents
useful
to
ecclesiasticism
another
discovery
revealed
their
equal
skill
in
forging
documents
useful
to
theology
for
more
than
a
thousand
years
great
stress
had
been
laid
by
theologians
upon
the
writings
ascribed
to
dionysius
the
areopagite
the
athenian
convert
of
paul
claiming
to
come
from
one
so
near
the
great
apostle
they
were
prized
as
a
most
precious
supplement
to
holy
writ
a
belief
was
developed
that
when
paul
had
returned
to
earth
after
having
been
caught
up
to
the
third
heaven
he
had
revealed
to
dionysius
the
things
he
had
seen
hence
it
was
that
the
varied
pictures
given
in
these
writings
of
the
heavenly
hierarchy
and
the
angelic
ministers
of
the
almighty
took
strong
hold
upon
the
imagination
of
the
universal
church
their
theological
statements
sank
deeply
into
the
hearts
and
minds
of
the
mystics
of
the
twelfth
century
and
the
platonists
of
the
fifteenth
and
the
ten
epistles
they
contained
addressed
to
john
to
titus
to
polycarp
and
others
of
the
earliest
period
were
considered
treasures
of
sacred
history
an
emperor
of
the
east
had
sent
these
writings
to
an
emperor
of
the
west
as
the
most
precious
of
imperial
gifts
scotus
erigena
had
translated
them
thomas
aquinas
had
expounded
them
dante
had
glorified
them
albert
the
great
had
claimed
that
they
were
virtually
given
by
paul
and
inspired
by
the
holy
ghost
their
authenticity
was
taken
for
granted
by
fathers
doctors
popes
councils
and
the
universal
church
but
now
in
the
glow
of
the
renascence
all
this
treasure
was
found
to
be
but
dross
investigators
in
the
old
church
and
in
the
new
joined
in
proving
that
the
great
mass
of
it
was
spurious
to
say
nothing
of
other
evidences
it
failed
to
stand
the
simplest
of
all
tests
for
these
writings
constantly
presupposed
institutions
and
referred
to
events
of
much
later
date
than
the
time
of
dionysius
they
were
at
length
acknowledged
by
all
authorities
worthy
of
the
name
catholic
as
well
as
protestant
to
be
simply
like
the
isidorian
decretals
pious
frauds
thus
arose
an
atmosphere
of
criticism
very
different
from
the
atmosphere
of
literary
docility
and
acquiescence
of
the
ages
of
faith
thus
it
came
that
great
scholars
in
all
parts
of
europe
began
to
realize
as
never
before
the
part
which
theological
skill
and
ecclesiastical
zeal
had
taken
in
the
development
of
spurious
sacred
literature
thus
was
stimulated
a
new
energy
in
research
into
all
ancient
documents
no
matter
what
their
claims
to
strengthen
this
feeling
and
to
intensify
the
stimulating
qualities
of
this
new
atmosphere
came
as
we
have
seen
the
researches
and
revelations
of
valla
regarding
the
forged
letter
of
christ
to
abgarus
the
fraudulent
donation
of
constantine
and
the
late
date
of
the
apostles
creed
and
to
give
this
feeling
direction
toward
the
hebrew
and
christian
sacred
books
came
the
example
of
erasmus

very
fair
statements

in

that

what
we
now
call
a
forgery

in

the

soon
began
to
push
more
vigorously
the
researches
begun
centuries
before
by
aben
ezra
and
the
next
efforts
of
these
men
were
seen
about
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
when
hobbes
in
his
leviathan
and
la
pevrere
in
his
preadamites
took
them
up
and
developed
them
still
further
the
result
came
speedily
hobbes
for
this
and
other
sins
was
put
under
the
ban
even
by
the
political
party
which
sorely
needed
him
and
was
regarded
generally
as
an
outcast
while
la
peyrere
for
this
and
other
heresies
was
thrown
into
prison
by
the
grand
vicar
of
mechlin
and
kept
there
until
he
fully
retracted
his
book
was
refuted
by
seven
theologians
within
a
year
after
its
appearance
and
within
a
generation
elaborate
answers
to
it
had
appeared
the
parliament
of
paris
ordered
it
to
be
burned
by
the
hangman
in
came
an
utterance
vastly
more
important
by
a
man
far
greater
than
any
of
these
the
tractatus
of
spinoza
reverently
but
firmly
he
went
much
more
deeply
into
the
subject
suggesting
new
arguments
and
recasting
the
old
he
summed
up
all
with
judicial
fairness
and
showed
that
moses
could
not
have
been
the
author
of
the
pentateuch
in
the
form
then
existing
that
there
had
been
glosses
and
revisions
that
the
biblical
books
had
grown
up
as
a
literature
that
though
great
truths
are
to
be
found
in
them
and
they
are
to
be
regarded
as
a
divine
revelation
the
old
claims
of
inerrancy
for
them
can
not
be
maintained
that
in
studying
them
men
had
been
misled
by
mistaking
human
conceptions
for
divine
meanings
that
while
prophets
have
been
inspired
the
prophetic
faculty
has
not
been
the
dowry
of
the
jewish
people
alone
that
to
look
for
exact
knowledge
of
natural
and
spiritual
phenomena
in
the
sacred
books
is
an
utter
mistake
and
that
the
narratives
of
the
old
and
new
testaments
while
they
surpass
those
of
profane
history
differ
among
themselves
not
only
in
literary
merit
but
in
the
value
of
the
doctrines
they
inculcate
as
to
the
authorship
of
the
pentateuch
he
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
it
was
written
long
after
moses
but
that
moses
may
have
written
some
books
from
which
it
was
compiled
as
for
example
those
which
are
mentioned
in
the
scriptures
the
book
of
the
wars
of
god
the
book
of
the
covenant
and
the
like
and
that
the
many
repetitions
and
contradictions
in
the
various
books
show
a
lack
of
careful
editing
as
well
as
a
variety
of
original
sources
spinoza
then
went
on
to
throw
light
into
some
other
books
of
the
old
and
new
testaments
and
added
two
general
statements
which
have
proved
exceedingly
serviceable
for
they
contain
the
germs
of
all
modern
broad
churchmanship
and
the
first
of
them
gave
the
formula
which
was
destined
in
our
own
time
to
save
to
the
anglican
church
a
large
number
of
her
noblest
sons
this
was
that
sacred
scripture
contains
the
word
of
god
and
in
so
far
as
it
contains
it
is
incorruptible
the
second
was
that
error
in
speculative
doctrine
is
not
impious
though
published
in
various
editions
the
book
seemed
to
produce
little
effect
upon
the
world
at
that
time
but
its
result
to
spinoza
himself
was
none
the
less
serious
though
so
deeply
religious
that
novalis
spoke
of
him
as
a
man
and
schleiermacher
called
him
a
saint
he
had
been
for
the
earlier
expression
of
some
of
the
opinions
it
contained
abhorred
as
a
heretic
both
by
jews
and
christians
from
the
synagogue
he
was
cut
off
by
a
public
curse
and
by
the
church
he
was
now
regarded
as
in
some
sort
a
forerunner
of
antichrist
for
all
this
he
showed
no
resentment
but
devoted
himself
quietly
to
his
studies
and
to
the
simple
manual
labour
by
which
he
supported
himself
declined
all
proffered
honours
among
them
a
professorship
at
heidelberg
found
pleasure
only
in
the
society
of
a
few
friends
as
gentle
and
affectionate
as
himself
and
died
contentedly
without
seeing
any
widespread
effect
of
his
doctrine
other
than
the
prevailing
abhorrence
of
himself
perhaps
in
all
the
seventeenth
century
there
was
no
man
whom
jesus
of
nazareth
would
have
more
deeply
loved
and
no
life
which
he
would
have
more
warmly
approved
yet
down
to
a
very
recent
period
this
hatred
for
spinoza
has
continued
when
about
it
was
proposed
to
erect
a
monument
to
him
at
amsterdam
discourses
were
given
in
churches
and
synagogues
prophesying
the
wrath
of
heaven
upon
the
city
for
such
a
profanation
and
when
the
monument
was
finished
the
police
were
obliged
to
exert
themselves
to
prevent
injury
to
the
statue
and
to
the
eminent
scholars
who
unveiled
it
but
the
ideas
of
spinoza
at
last
secured
recognition
they
had
sunk
deeply
into
the
hearts
and
minds
of
various
leaders
of
thought
and
most
important
of
all
into
the
heart
and
mind
of
lessing
he
brought
them
to
bear
in
his
treatise
on
the
education
of
the
world
as
well
as
in
his
drama
nathan
the
wise
and
both
these
works
have
spoken
with
power
to
every
generation
since
in
france
also
came
the
same
healthful
evolution
of
thought
for
generations
scholars
had
known
that
multitudes
of
errors
had
crept
into
the
sacred
text
robert
stephens
had
found
over
two
thousand
variations
in
the
oldest
manuscripts
of
the
old
testament
and
in
jean
morin
a
priest
of
the
oratory
pointed
out
clearly
many
of
the
most
glaring
of
these
seventeen
years
later
in
spite
of
the
most
earnest
protestant
efforts
to
suppress
his
work
cappellus
gave
forth
his
critica
sacra
demonstrating
not
only
that
the
vowel
pointing
of
scripture
was
not
divinely
inspired
but
that
the
hebrew
text
itself
from
which
the
modern
translations
were
made
is
full
of
errors
due
to
the
carelessness
ignorance
and
doctrinal
zeal
of
early
scribes
and
that
there
had
clearly
been
no
miraculous
preservation
of
the
original
autographs
of
the
sacred
books
while
orthodox
france
was
under
the
uneasiness
and
alarm
thus
caused
appeared
a
critical
history
of
the
old
testament
by
richard
simon
a
priest
of
the
oratory
he
was
a
thoroughly
religious
man
and
an
acute
scholar
whose
whole
purpose
was
to
develop
truths
which
he
believed
healthful
to
the
church
and
to
mankind
but
he
denied
that
moses
was
the
author
of
the
pentateuch
and
exhibited
the
internal
evidence
now
so
well
known
that
the
books
were
composed
much
later
by
various
persons
and
edited
later
still
he
also
showed
that
other
parts
of
the
old
testament
had
been
compiled
from
older
sources
and
attacked
the
theory
that
hebrew
was
the
primitive
language
of
mankind
the
whole
character
of
his
book
was
such
that
in
these
days
it
would
pass
on
the
whole
as
conservative
and
orthodox
it
had
been
approved
by
the
censor
in
and
printed
when
the
table
of
contents
and
a
page
of
the
preface
were
shown
to
bossuet
the
great
bishop
and
theologian
was
instantly
aroused
he
pronounced
the
work
a
mass
of
impieties
and
a
bulwark
of
irreligion
his
biographer
tells
us
that
although
it
was
holy
thursday
the
bishop
in
spite
of
the
solemnity
of
the
day
hastened
at
once
to
the
chancellor
le
tellier
and
secured
an
order
to
stop
the
publication
of
the
book
and
to
burn
the
whole
edition
of
it
fortunately
a
few
copies
were
rescued
and
a
few
years
later
the
work
found
a
new
publisher
in
holland
yet
not
until
there
had
been
attached
to
it
evidently
by
some
protestant
divine
of
authority
an
essay
warning
the
reader
against
its
dangerous
doctrines
two
years
later
a
translation
was
published
in
england
this
first
work
of
simon
was
followed
by
others
in
which
he
sought
in
the
interest
of
scriptural
truth
to
throw
a
new
and
purer
light
upon
our
sacred
literature
but
bossuet
proved
implacable
although
unable
to
suppress
all
of
simon
works
he
was
able
to
drive
him
from
the
oratory
and
to
bring
him
into
disrepute
among
the
very
men
who
ought
to
have
been
proud
of
him
as
frenchmen
and
thankful
to
him
as
christians
but
other
scholars
of
eminence
were
now
working
in
this
field
and
chief
among
them
le
clerc
virtually
driven
out
of
geneva
he
took
refuge
at
amsterdam
and
there
published
a
series
of
works
upon
the
hebrew
language
the
interpretation
of
scripture
and
the
like
in
these
he
combated
the
prevalent
idea
that
hebrew
was
the
primitive
tongue
expressed
the
opinion
that
in
the
plural
form
of
the
word
used
in
genesis
for
god
elohim
there
is
a
trace
of
chaldean
polytheism
and
in
his
discussion
on
the
serpent
who
tempted
eve
curiously
anticipated
modern
geological
and
zoological
ideas
by
quietly
confessing
his
inability
to
see
how
depriving
the
serpent
of
feet
and
compelling
him
to
go
on
his
belly
could
be
punishment
since
all
this
was
natural
to
the
animal
he
also
ventured
explanations
of
the
confusion
of
tongues
at
babel
the
destruction
of
sodom
the
conversion
of
wife
into
a
pillar
of
salt
and
the
dividing
of
the
red
sea
as
to
the
pentateuch
in
general
he
completely
rejected
the
idea
that
it
was
written
by
moses
but
his
most
permanent
gift
to
the
thinking
world
was
his
answer
to
those
who
insisted
upon
the
reference
by
christ
and
his
apostles
to
moses
as
the
author
of
the
pentateuch
the
answer
became
a
formula
which
has
proved
effective
from
his
day
to
ours
our
lord
and
his
apostles
did
not
come
into
this
world
to
teach
criticism
to
the
jews
and
hence
spoke
according
to
the
common
opinion
against
all
these
scholars
came
a
theological
storm
but
it
raged
most
pitilessly
against
le
clerc
such
renowned
theologians
as
carpzov
in
germany
witsius
in
holland
and
huet
in
france
berated
him
unmercifully
and
overwhelmed
him
with
assertions
which
still
fill
us
with
wonder
that
of
huet
attributing
the
origin
of
pagan
as
well
as
christian
theology
to
moses
we
have
already
seen
but
carpzov
showed
that
protestantism
could
not
be
outdone
by
catholicism
when
he
declared
in
the
face
of
all
modern
knowledge
that
not
only
the
matter
but
the
exact
form
and
words
of
the
bible
had
been
divinely
transmitted
to
the
modern
world
free
from
all
error
at
this

of

scriptural
interpretation
some
of
them
gaining
the
applause
of
the
christian
world
then
though
nearly
all
are
utterly
discredited
now
but
in
appeared
two
contributions
of
permanent
influence
though
differing
vastly
in
value
in
the
comparative
estimate
of
these
two
works
the
world
has
seen
a
remarkable
reversal
of
public
opinion
the
first
of
these
was
bishop
lowth
prelections
upon
the
sacred
poetry
of
the
hebrews
in
this
was
well
brought
out
that
characteristic
of
hebrew
poetry
to
which
it
owes
so
much
of
its
peculiar
charm
its
parallelism
the
second
of
these
books
was
astruc
conjectures
on
the
original
memoirs
which
moses
used
in
composing
the
book
of
genesis
in
this
was
for
the
first
time
clearly
revealed
the
fact
that
amid
various
fragments
of
old
writings
at
least
two
main
narratives
enter
into
the
composition
of
genesis
that
in
the
first
of
these
is
generally
used
as
an
appellation
of
the
almighty
the
word
elohim
and
in
the
second
the
word
yahveh
jehovah
that
each
narrative
has
characteristics
of
its
own
in
thought
and
expression
which
distinguish
it
from
the
other
that
by
separating
these
two
clear
and
distinct
narratives
may
be
obtained
each
consistent
with
itself
and
that
thus
and
thus
alone
can
be
explained
the
repetitions
discrepancies
and
contradictions
in
genesis
which
so
long
baffled
the
ingenuity
of
commentators
especially
the
two
accounts
of
the
creation
so
utterly
inconsistent
with
each
other
interesting
as
was
lowth
book
this
work
by
astruc
was
as
the
thinking
world
now
acknowledges
infinitely
more
important
it
was
indeed
the
most
valuable
single
contribution
ever
made
to
biblical
study
but
such
was
not
the
judgment
of
the
world
then
while
book
was
covered
with
honour
and
its
author
promoted
from
the
bishopric
of
david
to
that
of
london
and
even
offered
the
primacy
astruc
and
his
book
were
covered
with
reproach
though
as
an
orthodox
catholic
he
had
mainly
desired
to
reassert
the
authorship
of
moses
against
the
argument
of
spinoza
he
received
no
thanks
on
that
account
theologians
of
all
creeds
sneered
at
him
as
a
doctor
of
medicine
who
had
blundered
beyond
his
province
his
in
france
bitterly
denounced
him
as
a
heretic
and
in
germany
the
great
protestant
theologian
michaelis
who
had
edited
and
exalted
lowth
work
poured
contempt
over
astruc
as
an
ignoramus
the
case
of
astruc
is
one
of
the
many
which
show
the
wonderful
power
of
the
older
theological
reasoning
to
close
the
strongest
minds
against
the
clearest
truths
the
fact
which
he
discovered
is
now
as
definitely
established
as
any
in
the
whole
range
of
literature
or
science
it
has
become
as
clear
as
the
day
and
yet
for
two
thousand
years
the
minds
of
professional
theologians
jewish
and
christian
were
unable
to
detect
it
not
until
this
eminent
physician
applied
to
the
subject
a
mind
trained
in
making
scientific
distinctions
was
it
given
to
the
world
it
was
of
course
not
possible
even
for
so
eminent
a
scholar
as
michaelis
to
down
a
discovery
so
pregnant
and
curiously
enough
it
was
one
of
michaelis
own
scholars
eichhorn
who
did
the
main
work
in
bringing
the
new
truth
to
bear
upon
the
world
he
with
others
developed
out
of
it
the
theory
that
genesis
and
indeed
the
pentateuch
is
made
up
entirely
of
fragments
of
old
writings
mainly
disjointed
but
they
did
far
more
than
this
they
impressed
upon
the
thinking
part
of
christendom
the
fact
that
the
bible
is
not
a
book
but
a
literature
that
the
style
is
not
supernatural
and
unique
but
simply
the
oriental
style
of
the
lands
and
times
in
which
its
various
parts
were
written
and
that
these
must
be
studied
in
the
light
of
the
modes
of
thought
and
statement
and
the
literary
habits
generally
of
oriental
peoples
from
eichhorn
time
the
process
which
by
historical
philological
and
textual
research
brings
out
the
truth
regarding
this
literature
has
been
known
as
the
higher
criticism
he
was
a
deeply
religious
man
and
the
mainspring
of
his
efforts
was
the
desire
to
bring
back
to
the
church
the
educated
classes
who
had
been
repelled
by
the
stiff
lutheran
orthodoxy
but
this
only
increased
hostility
to
him
opposition
met
him
in
germany
at
every
turn
and
in
england
lloyd
regius
professor
of
hebrew
at
cambridge
who
sought
patronage
for
a
translation
of
eichhorn
work
was
met
generally
with
contempt
and
frequently
with
insult
throughout
catholic
germany
it
was
even
worse
in
isenbiehl
a
priest
at
mayence
who
had
distinguished
himself
as
a
greek
and
hebrew
scholar
happened
to
question
the
usual
interpretation
of
the
passage
in
isaiah
which
refers
to
the
immanuel
and
showed
then
what
every
competent
critic
knows
now
that
it
had
reference
to
events
looked
for
in
older
jewish
history
the
censorship
and
faculty
of
theology
attacked
him
at
once
and
brought
him
before
the
elector
luckily
this
potentate
was
one
of
the
old
and
contented
himself
with
telling
the
priest
that
though
his
contention
was
perhaps
true
he
must
remain
in
the
old
paths
and
avoid
everything
likely
to
make
trouble
but
at
the
elector
death
soon
afterward
the
theologians
renewed
the
attack
threw
isenbiehl
out
of
his
professorship
and
degraded
him
one
insult
deserves
mention
for
its
ingenuity
it
was
declared
that
he
the
successful
and
brilliant
professor
showed
by
the
obnoxious
interpretation
that
he
had
not
yet
rightly
learned
the
scriptures
he
was
therefore
sent
back
to
the
benches
of
the
theological
school
and
made
to
take
his
seat
among
the
ingenuous
youth
who
were
conning
the
rudiments
of
theology
at
this
he
made
a
new
statement
so
carefully
guarded
that
it
disarmed
many
of
his
enemies
and
his
high
scholarship
soon
won
for
him
a
new
professorship
of
greek
the
condition
being
that
he
should
cease
writing
upon
scripture
but
a
crafty
bookseller
having
republished
his
former
book
and
having
protected
himself
by
keeping
the
place
and
date
of
publication
secret
a
new
storm
fell
upon
the
author
he
was
again
removed
from
his
professorship
and
thrown
into
prison
his
book
was
forbidden
and
all
copies
of
it
in
that
part
of
germany
were
confiscated
in
having
escaped
from
prison
he
sought
refuge
with
another
of
the
minor
rulers
who
in
blissful
unconsciousness
were
doing
their
worst
while
awaiting
the
french
revolution
but
was
at
once
delivered
up
to
the
mayence
authorities
and
again
thrown
into
prison
the
pope
pius
vi
now
intervened
with
a
brief
on
isenbiehl
book
declaring
it
horrible
false
perverse
destructive
tainted
with
heresy
and
excommunicating
all
who
should
read
it
at
this
isenbiehl
declaring
that
he
had
written
it
in
the
hope
of
doing
a
service
to
the
church
recanted
and
vegetated
in
obscurity
until
his
death
in
but
despite
theological
faculties
and
even
popes
the
new
current
of
thought
increased
in
strength
and
volume
and
into
it
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
came
important
contributions
from
two
sources
widely
separated
and
most
dissimilar
the
first
of
these
which
gave
a
stimulus
not
yet
exhausted
was
the
work
of
herder
by
a
remarkable
intuition
he
had
anticipated
some
of
those
ideas
of
an
evolutionary
process
in
nature
and
in
literature
which
first
gained
full
recognition
nearly
three
quarters
of
a
century
after
him
but
his
greatest
service
in
the
field
of
biblical
study
was
his
work
at
once
profound
and
brilliant
the
spirit
of
hebrew
poetry
in
this
field
he
eclipsed
bishop
lowth
among
other
things
of
importance
he
showed
that
the
psalms
were
by
different
authors
and
of
different
periods
the
bloom
of
a
great
poetic
literature
until
his
time
no
one
had
so
clearly
done
justice
to
their
sublimity
and
beauty
but
most
striking
of
all
was
his
discussion
of
solomon
song
for
over
twenty
centuries
it
had
been
customary
to
attribute
to
it
mystical
meanings
if
here
and
there
some
man
saw
the
truth
he
was
careful
like
aben
ezra
to
speak
with
bated
breath
the
penalty
for
any
more
honest
interpretation
was
seen
among
protestants
when
calvin
and
beza
persecuted
castellio
covered
him
with
obloquy
and
finally
drove
him
to
starvation
and
death
for
throwing
light
upon
the
real
character
of
the
song
of
songs
and
among
catholics
it
was
seen
when
philip
ii
allowed
the
pious
and
gifted
luis
de
leon
for
a
similar
offence
to
be
thrown
into
a
dungeon
of
the
inquisition
and
kept
there
for
five
years
until
his
health
was
utterly
shattered
and
his
spirit
so
broken
that
he
consented
to
publish
a
new
commentary
on
the
song
as
theological
and
obscure
as
the
most
orthodox
could
desire
here
too
we
have
an
example
of
the
efficiency
of
the
older
biblical
theology
in
fettering
the
stronger
minds
and
in
stupefying
the
weaker
just
as
the
book
of
genesis
had
to
wait
over
two
thousand
years
for
a
physician
to
reveal
the
simplest
fact
regarding
its
structure
so
the
song
of
songs
had
to
wait
even
longer
for
a
poet
to
reveal
not
only
its
beauty
but
its
character
commentators
innumerable
had
interpreted
it
bernard
had
preached
over
eighty
sermons
on
its
first
two
chapters
palestrina
had
set
its
most
erotic
parts
to
sacred
music
jews
and
gentiles
catholics
and
protestants
from
origen
to
aben
ezra
and
from
luther
to
bossuet
had
uncovered
its
deep
meanings
and
had
demonstrated
it
to
be
anything
and
everything
save
that
which
it
really
is
among
scores
of
these
strange
imaginations
it
was
declared
to
represent
the
love
of
jehovah
for
israel
the
love
of
christ
for
the
church
the
praises
of
the
blessed
virgin
the
union
of
the
soul
with
the
body
sacred
history
from
the
exodus
to
the
messiah
church
history
from
the
crucifixion
to
the
reformation
and
some
of
the
more
acute
protestant
divines
found
in
it
references
even
to
the
religious
wars
in
germany
and
to
the
peace
of
passau
in
these
days
it
seems
hard
to
imagine
how
really
competent
reasoners
could
thus
argue
without
laughing
in
each
other
faces
after
the
manner
of
cicero
augurs
herder
showed
solomon
song
to
be
what
the
whole
thinking
world
now
knows
it
to
be
simply
an
oriental
but
his
frankness
brought
him
into
trouble
he
was
bitterly
assailed
neither
his
noble
character
nor
his
genius
availed
him
obliged
to
flee
from
one
pastorate
to
another
he
at
last
found
a
happy
refuge
at
weimar
in
the
society
of
goethe
wieland
and
jean
paul
and
thence
he
exercised
a
powerful
influence
in
removing
noxious
and
parasitic
growths
from
religious
thought
it
would
hardly
be
possible
to
imagine
a
man
more
different
from
herder
than
was
the
other
of
the
two
who
most
influenced
biblical
interpretation
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
this
was
alexander
geddes
a
roman
catholic
priest
and
a
scotchman
having
at
an
early
period
attracted
much
attention
by
his
scholarship
and
having
received
the
very
rare
distinction
for
a
catholic
of
a
doctorate
from
the
university
of
aberdeen
he
began
publishing
in
a
new
translation
of
the
old
testament
and
followed
this
in
with
a
volume
of
critical
remarks
in
these
he
supported
mainly
three
views
first
that
the
pentateuch
in
its
present
form
could
not
have
been
written
by
moses
secondly
that
it
was
the
work
of
various
hands
and
thirdly
that
it
could
not
have
been
written
before
the
time
of
david
although
there
was
a
fringe
of
doubtful
theories
about
them
these
main
conclusions
supported
as
they
were
by
deep
research
and
cogent
reasoning
are
now
recognised
as
of
great
value
but
such
was
not
the
orthodox
opinion
then
though
a
man
of
sincere
piety
who
throughout
his
entire
life
remained
firm
in
the
faith
of
his
fathers
he
and
his
work
were
at
once
condemned
he
was
suspended
by
the
catholic
authorities
as
a
misbeliever
denounced
by
protestants
as
an
infidel
and
taunted
by
both
as
a
corrector
of
the
holy
ghost
of
course
by
this
taunt
was
meant
nothing
more
than
that
he
dissented
from
sundry
ideas
inherited
from
less
enlightened
times
by
the
men
who
just
then
happened
to
wield
ecclesiastical
power
but
not
all
the
opposition
to
him
could
check
the
evolution
of
his
thought
a
line
of
great
men
followed
in
these
paths
opened
by
astruc
and
eichhorn
and
broadened
by
herder
and
geddes
of
these
was
de
wette
whose
various
works
especially
his
introduction
to
the
old
testament
gave
a
new
impulse
early
in
the
nineteenth
century
to
fruitful
thought
throughout
christendom
in
these
writings
while
showing
how
largely
myths
and
legends
had
entered
into
the
hebrew
sacred
books
he
threw
especial
light
into
the
books
deuteronomy
and
chronicles
the
former
he
showed
to
be
in
the
main
a
late
priestly
summary
of
law
and
the
latter
a
very
late
priestly
recast
of
early
history
he
had
indeed
to
pay
a
penalty
for
thus
aiding
the
world
in
its
march
toward
more
truth
for
he
was
driven
out
of
germany
and
obliged
to
take
refuge
in
a
swiss
professorship
while
theodore
parker
who
published
an
english
translation
of
his
work
was
for
this
and
similar
sins
virtually
rejected
by
what
claimed
to
be
the
most
liberal
of
all
christian
bodies
in
the
united
states
but
contributions
to
the
new
thought
continued
from
quarters
whence
least
was
expected
gesenius
by
his
hebrew
grammar
and
ewald
by
his
historical
studies
greatly
advanced
it
to
them
and
to
all
like
them
during
the
middle
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
was
sturdily
opposed
the
colossus
of
orthodoxy
hengstenberg
in
him
was
combined
the
haughtiness
of
a
prussian
the
zeal
of
a
spanish
inquisitor
and
the
flippant
brutality
of
a
french
orthodox
journalist
behind
him
stood
the
gifted
but
erratic
frederick
william
iv
a
man
admirably
fitted
for
a
professorship
of
aesthetics
but
whom
an
inscrutable
fate
had
made
king
of
prussia
both
these
rulers
in
the
german
israel
arrayed
all
possible
opposition
against
the
great
scholars
labouring
in
the
new
paths
but
this
opposition
was
vain
the
succession
of
acute
and
honest
scholars
continued
vatke
bleek
reuss
graf
kayser
hupfeld
delitzsch
kuenen
and
others
wrought
on
in
germany
and
holland
steadily
developing
the
new
truth
especially
to
be
mentioned
among
these
is
hupfeld
who
published
in
his
treatise
on
the
sources
of
genesis
accepting
the
conjectures
which
astruc
had
published
just
a
hundred
years
before
he
established
what
has
ever
since
been
recognised
by
the
leading
biblical
commentators
as
the
true
basis
of
work
upon
the
pentateuch
the
fact
that
three
true
documents
are
combined
in
genesis
each
with
its
own
characteristics
he
too
had
to
pay
a
price
for
letting
more
light
upon
the
world
a
determined
attempt
was
made
to
punish
him
though
deeply
religious
in
his
nature
and
aspirations
he
was
denounced
in
to
the
prussian
government
as
guilty
of
irreverence
but
to
the
credit
of
his
noble
and
true
colleagues
who
trod
in
the
more
orthodox
paths
men
like
tholuck
and
julius
muller
the
theological
faculty
of
the
university
of
halle
protested
against
this
persecuting
effort
and
it
was
brought
to
naught
the
demonstrations
of
hupfeld
gave
new
life
to
biblical
scholarship
in
all
lands
more
and
more
clear
became
the
evidence
that
throughout
the
pentateuch
and
indeed
in
other
parts
of
our
sacred
books
there
had
been
a
fusion
of
various
ideas
a
confounding
of
various
epochs
and
a
compilation
of
various
documents
thus
was
opened
a
new
field
of
thought
and
work
in
sifting
out
this
literature
in
rearranging
it
and
in
bringing
it
into
proper
connection
with
the
history
of
the
jewish
race
and
of
humanity
astruc
and
hupfeld
having
thus
found
a
key
to
the
true
character
of
the
mosaic
scriptures
a
second
key
was
found
which
opened
the
way
to
the
secret
of
order
in
all
this
chaos
for
many
generations
one
thing
had
especially
puzzled
commentators
and
given
rise
to
masses
of
futile
reconciliation
this
was
the
patent
fact
that
such
men
as
samuel
david
elijah
isaiah
and
indeed
the
whole
jewish
people
down
to
the
exile
showed
in
all
their
utterances
and
actions
that
they
were
utterly
ignorant
of
that
vast
system
of
ceremonial
law
which
according
to
the
accounts
attributed
to
moses
and
other
parts
of
our
sacred
books
was
in
full
force
during
their
time
and
during
nearly
a
thousand
years
before
the
exile
it
was
held
always
everywhere
and
by
all
that
in
the
old
testament
the
chronological
order
of
revelation
was
first
the
law
secondly
the
psalms
thirdly
the
prophets
this
belief
continued
unchallenged
during
more
than
two
thousand
years
and
until
after
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
yet
as
far
back
as
vatke
at
berlin
had
in
his
religion
of
the
old
testament
expressed
his
conviction
that
this
belief
was
unfounded
reasoning
that
jewish
thought
must
have
been
subject
to
the
laws
of
development
which
govern
other
systems
he
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
the
legislation
ascribed
to
moses
and
especially
the
elaborate
paraphernalia
and
composite
ceremonies
of
the
ritual
could
not
have
come
into
being
at
a
period
so
rude
as
that
depicted
in
the
mosaic
accounts
although
vatke
wrapped
this
statement
in
a
mist
of
hegelian
metaphysics
a
sufficient
number
of
watchmen
on
the
walls
of
the
prussian
zion
saw
its
meaning
and
an
alarm
was
given
the
chroniclers
tell
us
that
fear
of
failing
in
the
examinations
through
knowing
too
much
kept
students
away
from
vatke
lectures
naturally
while
hengstenberg
and
frederick
william
iv
were
commanding
the
forces
of
orthodoxy
vatke
thought
it
wise
to
be
silent
still
the
new
idea
was
in
the
air
indeed
it
had
been
divined
about
a
year
earlier
on
the
other
side
of
the
rhine
by
a
scholar
well
known
as
acute
and
thoughtful
reuss
of
strasburg
unfortunately
he
too
was
overawed
and
he
refrained
from
publishing
his
thought
during
more
than
forty
years
but
his
ideas
were
caught
by
some
of
his
most
gifted
scholars
and
of
these
graf
and
kayser
developed
them
and
had
the
courage
to
publish
them
at
the
same
period
this
new
master
key
was
found
and
applied
by
a
greater
man
than
any
of
these
by
kuenen
of
holland
and
thus
it
was
that
three
eminent
scholars
working
in
different
parts
of
europe
and
on
different
lines
in
spite
of
all
obstacles
joined
in
enforcing
upon
the
thinking
world
the
conviction
that
the
complete
levitical
law
had
been
established
not
at
the
beginning
but
at
the
end
of
the
jewish
nation
mainly
indeed
after
the
jewish
nation
as
an
independent
political
body
had
ceased
to
exist
that
this
code
had
not
been
revealed
in
the
childhood
of
israel
but
that
it
had
come
into
being
in
a
perfectly
natural
way
during
israel
final
decay
during
the
period
when
heroes
and
prophets
had
been
succeeded
by
priests
thus
was
the
historical
and
psychological
evolution
of
jewish
institutions
brought
into
harmony
with
the
natural
development
of
human
thought
elaborate
ceremonial
institutions
being
shown
to
have
come
after
the
ruder
beginnings
of
religious
development
instead
of
before
them
thus
came
a
new
impulse
to
research
and
the
fruitage
was
abundant
the
older
theological
interpretation
with
its
insoluble
puzzles
yielded
on
all
sides
the
lead
in
the
new
epoch
thus
opened
was
taken
by
kuenen
starting
with
strong
prepossessions
in
favour
of
the
older
thought
and
even
with
violent
utterances
against
some
of
the
supporters
of
the
new
view
he
was
borne
on
by
his
love
of
truth
until
his
great
work
the
religion
of
israel
published
in
attracted
the
attention
of
thinking
scholars
throughout
the
world
by
its
arguments
in
favour
of
the
upward
movement
from
him
now
came
a
third
master
key
to
the
mystery
for
he
showed
that
the
true
opening
point
for
research
into
the
history
and
literature
of
israel
is
to
be
found
in
the
utterances
of
the
great
prophets
of
the
eighth
century
before
our
era
starting
from
these
he
opened
new
paths
into
the
periods
preceding
and
following
them
recognising
the
fact
that
the
religion
of
israel
was
like
other
great
world
religions
a
development
of
higher
ideas
out
of
lower
he
led
men
to
bring
deeper
thinking
and
wider
research
into
the
great
problem
with
ample
learning
and
irresistible
logic
he
proved
that
old
testament
history
is
largely
mingled
with
myth
and
legend
that
not
only
were
the
laws
attributed
to
moses
in
the
main
a
far
later
development
but
that
much
of
their
historical
setting
was
an
afterthought
also
that
old
testament
prophecy
was
never
supernaturally
predictive
and
least
of
all
predictive
of
events
recorded
in
the
new
testament
thus
it
was
that
his
genius
gave
to
the
thinking
world
a
new
point
of
view
and
a
masterly
exhibition
of
the
true
method
of
study
justly
has
one
of
the
most
eminent
divines
of
the
contemporary
anglican
church
indorsed
the
statement
of
another
eminent
scholar
that
kuenen
stood
upon
his
as
it
were
the
conscience
of
old
testament
science
that
his
work
is
characterized
not
merely
by
fine
scholarship
critical
insight
historical
sense
and
a
religious
nature
but
also
by
an
incorruptible
conscientiousness
and
a
majestic
devotion
to
the
quest
of
truth
thus
was
established
the
science
of
biblical
criticism
and
now
the
question
was
whether
the
church
of
northern
germany
would
accept
this
great
gift
the
fruit
of
centuries
of
devoted
toil
and
and
take
the
lead
of
christendom
in
and
by
it
the
great
curse
of
theology
and
ecclesiasticism
has
always
been
their
tendency
to
sacrifice
large
interests
to
small
charity
to
creed
unity
to
uniformity
fact
to
tradition
ethics
to
dogma
and
now
there
were
symptoms
throughout
the
governing
bodies
of
the
reformed
churches
indicating
a
determination
to
sacrifice
leadership
in
this
new
thought
to
ease
in
orthodoxy
every
revelation
of
new
knowledge
encountered
outcry
opposition
and
repression
and
what
was
worse
the
declarations
of
some
unwise
workers
in
the
critical
field
were
seized
upon
and
used
to
discredit
all
fruitful
research
fortunately
a
man
now
appeared
who
both
met
all
this
opposition
successfully
and
put
aside
all
the
half
truths
or
specious
untruths
urged
by
minor
critics
whose
zeal
outran
their
discretion
this
was
a
great
constructive
scholar
not
a
destroyer
but
a
builder
wellhausen
reverently
but
honestly
and
courageously
with
clearness
fulness
and
convicting
force
he
summed
up
the
conquests
of
scientific
criticism
as
bearing
on
hebrew
history
and
literature
these
conquests
had
reduced
the
vast
structures
which
theologians
had
during
ages
been
erecting
over
the
sacred
text
to
shapeless
ruin
and
rubbish
this
rubbish
he
removed
and
brought
out
from
beneath
it
the
reality
he
showed
jewish
history
as
an
evolution
obedient
to
laws
at
work
in
all
ages
and
jewish
literature
as
a
growth
out
of
individual
tribal
and
national
life
thus
was
our
sacred
history
and
literature
given
a
beauty
and
high
use
which
had
long
been
foreign
to
them
thereby
was
a
vast
service
rendered
immediately
to
germany
and
eventually
to
all
mankind
and
this
service
was
greatest
of
all

criticism
was
as

developed

in

many
considerations
there
as

combined
to
deter
men
from
opening

paths
to

not
even
in

were

there
at

the
sturdy

love
of
truth
for

sake
strengthened
by
the
kantian
ethics
found
no
such
obstacles
as
in

had
not

in

high
thinking

went
steadily
on

liberty
of
teaching

is
the
glory
of
the
northern

universities

it
did
not
secure

thinkers

did
at

in

in

see
pfleiderer
as
above
chap
i
in
england
the
admission
of
the
new
current
of
thought
was
apparently
impossible
the
traditional
system
of
biblical
interpretation
seemed
established
on
british
soil
forever
it
was
knit
into
the
whole
fabric
of
thought
and
observance
it
was
protected
by
the
most
justly
esteemed
hierarchy
the
world
has
ever
seen
it
was
intrenched
behind
the
palaces
the
cathedral
stalls
the
professors
chairs
the
country
parsonages
all
these
as
a
rule
the
seats
of
high
endeavour
and
beautiful
culture
the
older
thought
held
a
controlling
voice
in
the
senate
of
the
nation
it
was
dear
to
the
hearts
of
all
classes
it
was
superbly
endowed
every
strong
thinker
seemed
to
hold
a
brief
or
to
be
in
receipt
of
a
retaining
fee
for
it
as
to
preferment
in
the
church
there
was
a
cynical
aphorism
current
he
may
hold
anything
who
will
hold
his
tongue
for
an
eloquent
and
at
the
same
time
profound
statement
of

evils
flowing
from
the
moral
terrorism
and

tyrrany
at

i
yet
while
there
was
inevitably
much
alloy
of
worldly
wisdom
in
the
opposition
to
the
new

no
just
thinker
can
deny
far
higher
motives
to
many
perhaps
to
most
of
the
ecclesiastics
who
were
resolute
against
it
the
evangelical
movement
incarnate
in
the
wesleys
had
not
spent
its
strength
the
movement
begun
by
pusey
newman
keble
and
their
compeers
was
in
full
force
the
aesthetic
reaction
represented
on
the
continent
by
chateaubriand
manzoni
and
victor
hugo
and
in
england
by
walter
scott
pugin
ruskin
and
above
all
by
wordsworth
came
in
to
give
strength
to
this
barrier
under
the
magic
of
the
men
who
led
in
this
reaction
cathedrals
and
churches
which
in
the
previous
century
had
been
regarded
by
men
of
culture
as
mere
barbaric
masses
of
stone
and
mortar
to
be
masked
without
by
classic
colonnades
and
within
by
rococo
work
in
stucco
and
papier
mache
became
even
more
beloved
than
in
the
thirteenth
century
even
men
who
were
repelled
by
theological
disputations
were
fascinated
and
made
devoted
reactionists
by
the
newly
revealed
beauties
of
medieval
architecture
and
ritual
a
very
curious
example
of
this
insensibility
among
persons
of
really
high
culture
is
to
be
found
in
american
literature
toward
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
adams
wife
of
john
adams
afterward
president
of
the
united
states
but
at
that
time
minister
to
england
one
of
the
most
gifted
women
of
her
time
speaking
in
her
very
interesting
letters
from
england
of
her
journey
to
the
seashore
refers
to
canterbury
cathedral
seen
from
her
carriage
windows
and
which
she
evidently
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
enter
as
looking
like
a
vast
prison
so
too
about
the
same
time
thomas
jefferson
the
american
plenipotentiary
in
france
a
devoted
lover
of
classical
and
renaissance
architecture
giving
an
account
of
his
journey
to
paris
never
refers
to
any
of
the
beautiful
cathedrals
or
churches
upon
his
route
the
centre
and
fortress
of
this
vast
system
and
of
the
reaction
against
the
philosophy
of
the
eighteenth
century
was
the
university
of
oxford
orthodoxy
was
its
vaunt
and
a
special
exponent
of
its
spirit
and
object
of
its
admiration
was
its
member
of
parliament
william
ewart
gladstone
who
having
begun
his
political
career
by
a
laboured
plea
for
the
union
of
church
and
state
ended
it
by
giving
that
union
what
is
likely
to
be
a
the
mob
at
the
circus
of
constantinople
in
the
days
of
the
byzantine
emperors
was
hardly
more
wildly
orthodox
than
the
mob
of
students
at
this
foremost
seat
of
learning
of
the
race
during
the
middle
decades
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
moslem
students
of
el
azhar
are
hardly
more
intolerant
now
than
these
english
students
were
then
a
curious
proof
of
this
had
been
displayed
just
before
the
end
of
that
period
the
minister
of
the
united
states
at
the
court
of
james
was
then
edward
everett
he
was
undoubtedly
the
most
accomplished
scholar
and
one
of
the
foremost
statesmen
that
america
had
produced
his
eloquence
in
early
life
had
made
him
perhaps
the
most
admired
of
american
preachers
his
classical
learning
had
at
a
later
period
made
him
professor
of
greek
at
harvard
he
had
successfully
edited
the
leading
american
review
and
had
taken
a
high
place
in
american
literature
he
had
been
ten
years
a
member
of
congress
he
had
been
again
and
again
elected
governor
of
massachusetts
and
in
all
these
posts
he
had
shown
amply
those
qualities
which
afterward
made
him
president
of
harvard
secretary
of
state
of
the
united
states
and
a
united
states
senator
his
character
and
attainments
were
of
the
highest
and
as
he
was
then
occupying
the
foremost
place
in
the
diplomatic
service
of
his
country
he
was
invited
to
receive
an
appropriate
honorary
degree
at
oxford
but
on
his
presentation
for
it
in
the
sheldonian
theatre
there
came
a
revelation
to
the
people
he
represented
and
indeed
to
all
christendom
a
riot
having
been
carefully
prepared
beforehand
by
sundry
zealots
he
was
most
grossly
and
ingeniously
insulted
by
the
mob
of
undergraduates
and
bachelors
of
art
in
the
galleries
and
masters
of
arts
on
the
floor
and
the
reason
for
this
was
that
though
by
no
means
radical
in
his
religious
opinions
he
was
thought
to
have
been
in
his
early
life
and
to
be
possibly
at
that
time
below
what
was
then
the
oxford
fashion
in
belief
or
rather
feeling
regarding
the
mystery
of
the
trinity
at
the
centre
of
biblical
teaching
at
oxford
sat
pusey
regius
professor
of
hebrew
a
scholar
who
had
himself
remained
for
a
time
at
a
german
university
and
who
early
in
life
had
imbibed
just
enough
of
the
german
spirit
to
expose
him
to
suspicion
and
even
to
attack
one
charge
against
him
at
that
time
shows
curiously
what
was
then
expected
of
a
man
perfectly
sound
in
the
older
anglican
theology
he
had
ventured
to
defend
holy
writ
with
the
argument
that
there
were
fishes
actually
existing
which
could
have
swallowed
the
prophet
jonah
the
argument
proved
unfortunate
he
was
attacked
on
the
scriptural
ground
that
the
fish
which
swallowed
jonah
was
created
for
that
express
purpose
he
like
others
fell
back
under
the
charm
of
the
old
system
his
ideas
gave
force
to
the
reaction
in
the
quiet
of
his
study
which
especially
after
the
death
of
his
son
became
a
hermitage
he
relapsed
into
patristic
and
medieval
conceptions
of
christianity
enforcing
them
from
the
pulpit
and
in
his
published
works
he
now
virtually
accepted
the
famous
dictum
of
hugo
of
victor
that
one
is
first
to
find
what
is
to
be
believed
and
then
to
search
the
scriptures
for
proofs
of
it
his
devotion
to
the
main
features
of
the
older
interpretation
was
seen
at
its
strongest
in
his
utterances
regarding
the
book
of
daniel
just
as
cardinal
bellarmine
had
insisted
that
the
doctrine
of
the
incarnation
depends
upon
the
retention
of
the
ptolemaic
astronomy
just
as
danzius
had
insisted
that
the
very
continuance
of
religion
depends
on
the
divine
origin
of
the
hebrew
punctuation
just
as
peter
martyr
had
made
everything
sacred
depend
on
the
literal
acceptance
of
genesis
just
as
bishop
warburton
had
insisted
that
christianity
absolutely
depends
upon
a
right
interpretation
of
the
prophecies
regarding
antichrist
just
as
john
wesley
had
insisted
that
the
truth
of
the
bible
depends
on
the
reality
of
witchcraft
just
as
at
a
later
period
bishop
wilberforce
insisted
that
the
doctrine
of
the
incarnation
depends
on
the
mosaic
statements
regarding
the
origin
of
man
and
just
as
canon
liddon
insisted
that
christianity
itself
depends
on
a
literal
belief
in
flood
in
the
transformation
of
lot
wife
and
in
the
sojourn
of
jonah
in
the
whale
so
did
pusey
then
virtually
insist
that
christianity
must
stand
or
fall
with
the
early
date
of
the
book
of
daniel
happily
though
the
ptolemaic
astronomy
and
witchcraft
and
the
genesis
creation
myths
and
the
adam
noah
lot
and
jonah
legends
and
the
divine
origin
of
the
hebrew
punctuation
and
the
prophecies
regarding
antichrist
and
the
early
date
of
the
book
of
daniel
have
now
been
relegated
to
the
limbo
of
ontworn
beliefs
christianity
has
but
come
forth
the
stronger
nothing
seemed
less
likely
than
that
such
a
vast
intrenched
camp
as
that
of
which
oxford
was
the
centre
could
be
carried
by
an
effort
proceeding
from
a
few
isolated
german
and
dutch
scholars
yet
it
was
the
unexpected
which
occurred
and
it
is
instructive
to
note
that
even
at
the
period
when
the
champions
of
the
older
thought
were
to
all
appearance
impregnably
intrenched
in
england
a
way
had
been
opened
into
their
citadel
and
that
the
most
effective
agents
in
preparing
it
were
really
the
very
men
in
the
universities
and
cathedral
chapters
who
had
most
distinguished
themselves
by
uncompromising
and
intolerant
orthodoxy
a
rapid
survey
of
the
history
of
general
literary
criticism
at
that
epoch
will
reveal
this
fact
fully
during
the
last
decade
of
the
seventeenth
century
there
had
taken
place
the
famous
controversy
over
the
letters
of
phalaris
in
which
against
charles
boyle
and
his
supporters
at
oxford
was
pitted
richard
bentley
at
cambridge
who
insisted
that
the
letters
were
spurious
in
the
series
of
battles
royal
which
followed
although
boyle
aided
by
atterbury
afterward
so
noted
for
his
mingled
ecclesiastical
and
political
intrigues
had
gained
a
temporary
triumph
by
wit
and
humour
bentley
final
attack
had
proved
irresistible
drawing
from
the
stores
of
his
wonderfully
wide
and
minute
knowledge
he
showed
that
the
letters
could
not
have
been
written
in
the
time
of
phalaris
proving
this
by
an
exhibition
of
their
style
which
could
not
then
have
been
in
use
of
their
reference
to
events
which
had
not
then
taken
place
and
of
a
mass
of
considerations
which
no
one
but
a
scholar
almost
miraculously
gifted
could
have
marshalled
so
fully
the
controversy
had
attracted
attention
not
only
in
england
but
throughout
europe
with
bentley
reply
it
had
ended
in
spite
of
public
applause
at
atterbury
wit
scholars
throughout
the
world
acknowledged
victory
he
was
recognised
as
the
foremost
classical
scholar
of
his
time
the
mastership
of
trinity
which
he
accepted
and
the
bristol
bishopric
which
he
rejected
were
his
formal
reward
although
in
his
new
position
as
head
of
the
greatest
college
in
england
he
went
to
extreme
lengths
on
the
orthodox
side
in
biblical
theology
consenting
even
to
support
the
doctrine
that
the
hebrew
punctuation
was
divinely
inspired
this
was
as
nothing
compared
with
the
influence
of
the
system
of
criticism
which
he
introduced
into
english
studies
of
classical
literature
in
preparing
the
way
for
the
application
of
a
similar
system
to
all
literature
whether
called
sacred
or
profane
up
to
that
period
there
had
really
been
no
adequate
criticism
of
ancient
literature
whatever
name
had
been
attached
to
any
ancient
writing
was
usually
accepted
as
the
name
of
the
author
what
texts
should
be
imputed
to
an
author
was
settled
generally
on
authority
but
with
bentley
began
a
new
epoch
his
acute
intellect
and
exquisite
touch
revealed
clearly
to
english
scholars
the
new
science
of
criticism
and
familiarized
the
minds
of
thinking
men
with
the
idea
that
the
texts
of
ancient
literature
must
be
submitted
to
this
science
henceforward
a
new
spirit
reigned
among
the
best
classical
scholars
prophetic
of
more
and
more
light
in
the
greater
field
of
sacred
literature
scholars
of
whom
porson
was
chief
followed
out
this
method
and
though
at
times
as
in
own
case
they
were
warned
off
with
much
loss
and
damage
from
the
application
of
it
to
the
sacred
text
they
kept
alive
the
better
tradition
a
hundred
years
after
bentley
main
efforts
appeared
in
germany
another
book
wolf
introduction
to
homer
in
this
was
broached
the
theory
that
the
iliad
and
odyssey
are
not
the
works
of
a
single
great
poet
but
are
made
up
of
ballad
literature
wrought
into
unity
by
more
or
less
skilful
editing
in
spite
of
various
changes
and
phases
of
opinion
on
this
subject
since
wolf
day
he
dealt
a
killing
blow
at
the
idea
that
classical
works
are
necessarily
to
be
taken
at
what
may
be
termed
their
face
value
more
and
more
clearly
it
was
seen
that
the
ideas
of
early
copyists
and
even
of
early
possessors
of
masterpieces
in
ancient
literature
were
entirely
different
from
those
to
which
the
modern
world
is
accustomed
it
was
seen
that
manipulations
and
interpolations
in
the
text
by
copyists
and
possessors
had
long
been
considered
not
merely
venial
sins
but
matters
of
right
and
that
even
the
issuing
of
whole
books
under
assumed
names
had
been
practised
freely
in
a
light
akin
to
that
thrown
by
bentley
and
wolf
upon
ancient
literature
was
thrown
by
niebuhr
upon
ancient
history
in
his
history
of
rome
the
application
of
scientific
principles
to
the
examination
of
historical
sources
was
for
the
first
time
exhibited
largely
and
brilliantly
up
to
that
period
the
utterances
of
ancient
authorities
had
been
as
a
rule
accepted
as
final
no
breaking
away
even
from
the
most
absurd
of
them
was
looked
upon
with
favour
and
any
one
presuming
to
go
behind
them
was
regarded
as
troublesome
and
even
as
dangerous
through
this
sacred
conventionalism
niebuhr
broke
fearlessly
and
though
at
times
overcritical
he
struck
from
the
early
history
of
rome
a
vast
mass
of
accretions
and
gave
to
the
world
a
residue
infinitely
more
valuable
than
the
original
amalgam
of
myth
legend
and
chronicle
his
methods
were
especially
brought
to
bear
on
students
history
by
one
of
the
truest
men
and
noblest
scholars
that
the
english
race
has
produced
arnold
of
rugby
and
in
spite
of
the
inevitable
heavy
conservatism
were
allowed
to
do
their
work
in
the
field
of
ancient
history
as
well
as
in
that
of
ancient
classical
literature
the
place
of
myth
in
history
thus
became
more
and
more
understood
and
historical
foundations
at
least
so
far
as
secular
history
was
concerned
were
henceforth
dealt
with
in
a
scientific
spirit
the
extension
of
this
new
treatment
to
all
ancient
literature
and
history
was
now
simply
a
matter
of
time
such
an
extension
had
already
begun
for
in
had
appeared
history
of
the
jews
in
this
work
came
a
further
evolution
of
the
truths
and
methods
suggested
by
bentley
wolf
and
niebuhr
and
their
application
to
sacred
history
was
made
strikingly
evident
milman
though
a
clergyman
treated
the
history
of
the
chosen
people
in
the
light
of
modern
knowledge
of
oriental
and
especially
of
semitic
peoples
he
exhibited
sundry
great
biblical
personages
of
the
wandering
days
of
israel
as
sheiks
or
emirs
or
bedouin
chieftains
and
the
tribes
of
israel
as
obedient
then
to
the
same
general
laws
customs
and
ideas
governing
wandering
tribes
in
the
same
region
now
he
dealt
with
conflicting
sources
somewhat
in
the
spirit
of
bentley
and
with
the
mythical
legendary
and
miraculous
somewhat
in
the
spirit
of
niebuhr
this
treatment
of
the
history
of
the
jews
simply
as
the
development
of
an
oriental
tribe
raised
great
opposition
such
champions
of
orthodoxy
as
bishop
mant
and
faussett
straightway
took
the
field
and
with
such
effect
that
the
family
library
a
very
valuable
series
in
which
milman
history
appeared
was
put
under
the
ban
and
its
further
publication
stopped
for
years
milman
though
a
man
of
exquisite
literary
and
lofty
historical
gifts
as
well
as
of
most
honourable
character
was
debarred
from
preferment
and
outstripped
by
ecclesiastics
vastly
inferior
to
him
in
everything
save
worldly
wisdom
for
years
he
was
passed
in
the
race
for
honours
by
divines
who
were
content
either
to
hold
briefs
for
all
the
contemporary
unreason
which
happened
to
be
popular
or
to
keep
their
mouths
shut
altogether
this
opposition
to
him
extended
to
his
works
for
many
years
they
were
sneered
at
decried
and
kept
from
the
public
as
far
as
possible
fortunately
the
progress
of
events
lifted
him
before
the
closing
years
of
his
life
above
all
this
opposition
as
dean
of
paul
he
really
outranked
the
contemporary
archbishops
he
lived
to
see
his
main
ideas
accepted
and
his
history
of
latin
christianity
received
as
certainly
one
of
the
most
valuable
and
no
less
certainly
the
most
attractive
of
all
church
histories
ever
written
the
two
great
english
histories
of
greece
that
by
thirlwall
which
was
finished
and
that
by
grote
which
was
begun
in
the
middle
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
came
in
to
strengthen
this
new
development
by
application
of
the
critical
method
to
historical
sources
by
pointing
out
more
and
more
fully
the
inevitable
part
played
by
myth
and
legend
in
early
chronicles
by
displaying
more
and
more
clearly
the
ease
with
which
interpolations
of
texts
falsifications
of
statements
and
attributions
to
pretended
authors
were
made
they

the

while
it
had
not

able
to
maintain

effective
quarantine
against
continental
criticism
of
classical
literature
had
been
able
to
keep
up
barriers
fairly
strong
against
continental
discussions
of
sacred
literature
but
in
the
second
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
these
barriers
were
broken
at
many
points
and
the
stream
of
german
thought
being
united
with
the
current
of
devotion
to
truth
in
england
there
appeared
early
in
a
modest
volume
entitled
essays
and
reviews
this
work
discussed
sundry
of
the
older
theological
positions
which
had
been
rendered
untenable
by
modern
research
and
brought
to
bear
upon
them
the
views
of
the
newer
school
of
biblical
interpretation
the
authors
were
as
a
rule
scholars
in
the
prime
of
life
holding
influential
positions
in
the
universities
and
public
schools
they
were
seven
the
first
being
temple
a
successor
of

at
rugby

others

and
the
rev
jowett
the
only
one
of
the
seven
not
in
holy
orders
being
goodwin
all
the
articles
were
important
though
the
first
by
temple
on
the
education
of
the
world
and
the
last
by
jowett
on
the
interpretation
of
scripture
being
the
most
moderate
served
most
effectually
as
entering
wedges
into
the
old
tradition
at
first
no
great
attention
was
paid
to
the
book
the
only
notice
being
the
usual
attempts
in
sundry
clerical
newspapers
to
it
but
in
october
appeared
in
the
westminster
review
an
article
exulting
in
the
work
as
an
evidence
that
the
new
critical
method
had
at
last
penetrated
the
church
of
england
the
opportunity
for
defending
the
church
was
at
once
seized
by
no
less
a
personage
than
bishop
wilberforce
of
oxford
the
same
who
a
few
months
before
had
secured
a
fame
more
lasting
than
enviable
by
his
attacks
on
darwin
and
the
evolutionary
theory
his
first
onslaught
was
made
in
a
charge
to
his
clergy
this
he
followed
up
with
an
article
in
the
quarterly
review
very
explosive
in
its
rhetoric
much
like
that
which
he
had
devoted
in
the
same
periodical
to
darwin
the
bishop
declared
that
the
work
tended
toward
infidelity
if
not
to
atheism
that
the
writers
had
been
guilty
of
criminal
levity
that
with
the
exception
of
the
essay
by
temple
their
writings
were
full
of
sophistries
and
scepticisms
he
was
especially
bitter
against
jowett
dictum
interpret
the
scripture
like
any
other
book
he
insisted
that
goodwin
treatment
of
the
mosaic
account
of
the
origin
of
man
sweeps
away
the
whole
basis
of
inspiration
and
leaves
no
place
for
the
incarnation
and
through
the
article
were
scattered
such
rhetorical
adornments
as
the
words
infidel
atheistic
false
and
wanton
it
at
once
attracted
wide
attention
but
its
most
immediate
effect
was
to
make
the
fortune
of
essays
and
reviews
which
was
straightway
demanded
on
every
hand
went
through
edition
after
edition
and
became
a
power
in
the
land
at
this
a
panic
began
and
with
the
usual
results
of
panic
much
folly
and
some
cruelty
addresses
from
clergy
and
laity
many
of
them
frantic
with
rage
and
fear
poured
in
upon
the
bishops
begging
them
to
save
christianity
and
the
church
a
storm
of
abuse
arose
the
seven
essayists
were
stigmatized
as
the
seven
extinguishers
of
the
seven
lamps
of
the
apocalypse
the
seven
champions
not
of
christendom
as
a
result
of
all
this
pressure
sumner
archbishop
of
canterbury
one
of
the
last
of
the
old
kindly
bewigged
pluralists
of
the
georgian
period
headed
a
declaration
which
was
signed
by
the
archbishop
of
york
and
a
long
list
of
bishops
expressing
pain
at
the
appearance
of
the
book
but
doubts
as
to
the
possibility
of
any
effective
dealing
with
it
this
letter
only
made
matters
worse
the
orthodox
decried
it
as
timid
and
the
liberals
denounced
it
as
irregular
the
same
influences
were
exerted
in
the
sister
island
and
the
protestant
archbishops
in
ireland
issued
a
joint
letter
warning
the
faithful
against
the
disingenuousness
of
the
book
everything
seemed
to
increase
the
ferment
a
meeting
of
clergy
and
laity
having
been
held
at
oxford
in
the
matter
of
electing
a
professor
of
sanscrit
the
older
orthodox
party
having
made
every
effort
to
defeat
the
eminent
scholar
max
miller
and
all
in
vain
found
relief
after
their
defeat
in
new
denunciations
of
essays
and
reviews
of
the
two
prelates
who
might
have
been
expected
to
breast
the
storm
tait
bishop
of
london
afterward
archbishop
of
canterbury
bent
to
it
for
a
period
though
he
soon
recovered
himself
and
did
good
service
the
other
thirlwall
bishop
of
david
bided
his
time
and
when
the
proper
moment
came
struck
most
effective
blows
for
truth
and
justice
tait
and
shrewd
one
of
the
most
statesmanlike
of
prelates
at
first
endeavoured
to
detach
temple
and
jowett
from
their
associates
but
though
temple
was
broken
down
with
a
load
of
care
and
especially
by
the
fact
that
he
had
upon
his
shoulders
the
school
at
rugby
whose
patrons
had
become
alarmed
at
his
connection
with
the
book
he
showed
a
most
refreshing
courage
and
manliness
a
passage
from
his
letters
to
the
bishop
of
london
runs
as
follows
with
regard
to
my
own
conduct
i
can
only
say
that
nothing
on
earth
will
induce
me
to
do
what
you
propose
i
do
not
judge
for
others
but
in
me
it
would
be
base
and
untrue
on
another
occasion
temple
when
pressed
in
the
interest
of
the
institution
of
learning
under
his
care
to
detach
himself
from
his
associates
in
writing
the
book
declared
to
a
meeting
of
the
masters
of
the
school
that
if
any
statements
were
made
to
the
effect
that
he
disapproved
of
the
other
writers
in
the
volume
he
should
probably
find
it
his
duty
to
contradict
them
another
of
these
letters
to
the
bishop
of
london
contains
sundry
passages
of
great
force
one
is
as
follows
many
years
ago
you
urged
us
from
the
university
pulpit
to
undertake
the
critical
study
of
the
bible
you
said
that
it
was
a
dangerous
study
but
indispensable
you
described
its
difficulties
and
those
who
listened
must
have
felt
a
confidence
as
i
assuredly
did
for
i
was
there
that
if
they
took
your
advice
and
entered
on
the
task
you
at
any
rate
would
never
join
in
treating
them
unjustly
if
their
study
had
brought
with
it
the
difficulties
you
described
such
a
study
so
full
of
difficulties
imperatively
demands
freedom
for
its
condition
to
tell
a
man
to
study
and
yet
bid
him
under
heavy
penalties
come
to
the
same
conclusions
with
those
who
have
not
studied
is
to
mock
him
if
the
conclusions
are
prescribed
the
study
is
precluded
and
again
what
as
coming
from
a
man
who
has
since
held
two
of
the
most
important
bishoprics
in
the
english
church
is
of
great
importance
what
can
be
a
grosser
superstition
than
the
theory
of
literal
inspiration
but
because
that
has
a
regular
footing
it
is
to
be
treated
as
a
good
man
mistake
while
the
courage
to
speak
the
truth
about
the
first
chapter
of
genesis
is
a
wanton
piece
of
wickedness
the
storm
howled
on
in
the
convocation
of
canterbury
it
was
especially
violent
in
the
lower
house
archdeacon
denison
insisted
on
the
greatest
severity
as
he
said
for
the
sake
of
the
young
who
are
tainted
and
corrupted
and
thrust
almost
to
hell
by
the
action
of
this
book
at
another
time
the
same
eminent
churchman
declared
of
all
books
in
any
language
which
i
ever
laid
my
hands
on
this
is
incomparably
the
worst
it
contains
all
the
poison
which
is
to
be
found
in
tom
paine
age
of
reason
while
it
has
the
additional
disadvantage
of
having
been
written
by
clergymen
hysterical
as
all
this
was
the
upper
house
was
little
more
both
tait
and
thirlwall
trying
to
make
some
headway
against
the
swelling
tide
were
for
a
time
beaten
back
by
wilberforce
who
insisted
on
the
duty
of
the
church
to
clear
itself
publicly
from
complicity
with
men
who
as
he
said
gave
up
god
word
creation
redemption
and
the
work
of
the
holy
ghost
the
matter
was
brought
to
a
curious
issue
by
two
prosecutions
one
against
the
rev
williams
by
the
bishop
of
salisbury
the
other
against
the
rev
wilson
by
one
of
his
clerical
brethren
the
first
result
was
that
both
these
authors
were
sentenced
to
suspension
from
their
offices
for
a
year
at
this
the
two
condemned
clergymen
appealed
to
the
queen
in
council
upon
the
judicial
committee
to
try
the
case
in
last
resort
sat
the
lord
chancellor
the
two
archbishops
and
the
bishop
of
london
and
one
occurrence
now
brought
into
especial
relief
the
power
of
the
older
theological
reasoning
and
ecclesiastical
zeal
to
close
the
minds
of
the
best
of
men
to
the
simplest
principles
of
right
and
justice
among
the
men
of
his
time
most
deservedly
honoured
for
lofty
character
thorough
scholarship
and
keen
perception
of
right
and
justice
was
pusey
no
one
doubted
then
and
no
one
doubts
now
that
he
would
have
gone
to
the
stake
sooner
than
knowingly
countenance
wrong
or
injustice
and
yet
we
find
him
at
this
time
writing
a
series
of
long
and
earnest
letters
to
the
bishop
of
london
who
as
a
judge
was
hearing
this
case
which
involved
the
livelihood
and
even
the
good
name
of
the
men
on
trial
pointing
out
to
the
bishop
the
evil
consequences
which
must
follow
should
the
authors
of
essays
and
reviews
be
acquitted
and
virtually
beseeching
the
judges
on
grounds
of
expediency
to
convict
them
happily
bishop
tait
was
too
just
a
man
to
be
thrown
off
his
bearings
by
appeals
such
as
this
the
decision
of
the
court
as
finally
rendered
by
the
lord
chancellor
virtually
declared
it
to
be
no
part
of
the
duty
of
the
tribunal
to
pronounce
any
opinion
upon
the
book
that
the
court
only
had
to
do
with
certain
extracts
which
had
been
presented
among
these
was
one
adduced
in
support
of
a
charge
against
wilson
that
he
denied
the
doctrine
of
eternal
punishment
on
this
the
court
decided
that
it
did
not
find
in
the
formularies
of
the
english
church
any
such
distinct
declaration
upon
the
subject
as
to
require
it
to
punish
the
expression
of
a
hope
by
a
clergyman
that
even
the
ultimate
pardon
of
the
wicked
who
are
condemned
in
the
day
of
judgment
may
be
consistent
with
the
will
of
almighty
god
while
the
archbishops
dissented
from
this
judgment
bishop
tait
united
in
it
with
the
lord
chancellor
and
the
lay
judges
and
now
the
panic
broke
out
more
severely
than
ever
confusion
became
worse
confounded
the
insisted
that
the
tribunal
had
virtually
approved
essays
and
reviews
the
cynical
remarked
that
it
had
dismissed
hell
with
costs
an
alliance
was
made
at
once
between
the
more
zealous
high
and
low
church
men
and
oxford
became
its
headquarters
pusey
and
archdeacon
denison
were
among
the
leaders
and
an
impassioned
declaration
was
posted
to
every
clergyman
in
england
and
ireland
with
a
letter
begging
him
for
the
love
of
god
to
sign
it
thus
it
was
that
in
a
very
short
time
eleven
thousand
signatures
were
obtained
besides
this
deputations
claiming
to
represent
one
hundred
and
thousand
laymen
waited
on
the
archbishops
to
thank
them
for
dissenting
from
the
judgment
the
convocation
of
canterbury
also
plunged
into
the
fray
bishop
wilberforce
being
the
champion
of
the
older
orthodoxy
and
bishop
tait
of
the
new
caustic
was
the
speech
made
by
bishop
thirlwall
in
which
he
declared
that
he
considered
the
eleven
thousand
names
headed
by
that
of
pusey
attached
to
the
oxford
declaration
in
the
light
of
a
row
of
figures
preceded
by
a
decimal
point
so
that
however
far
the
series
may
be
advanced
it
never
can
rise
to
the
value
of
a
single
unit
in
spite
of
all
that
could
be
done
the
act
of
condemnation
was
carried
in
convocation
the
last
main
echo
of
this
whole
struggle
against
the
newer
mode
of
interpretation
was
heard
when
the
chancellor
referring
to
the
matter
in
the
house
of
lords
characterized
the
ecclesiastical
act
as
simply
a
series
of
terms
a
sentence
so
oily
and
saponaceous
that
no
one
can
grasp
it
like
an
eel
it
slips
through
your
fingers
and
is
simply
nothing
the
word
saponaceous
necessarily
elicited
a
bitter
retort
from
bishop
wilberforce
but
perhaps
the
most
valuable
judgment
on
the
whole
matter
was
rendered
by
bishop
tait
who
declared
these
things
have
so
effectually
frightened
the
clergy
that
i
think
there
is
scarcely
a
bishop
on
the
bench
unless
it
be
the
bishop
of
david
thirlwall
that
is
not
useless
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
the
widespread
alienation
of
intelligent
men
during
the
whole
controversy
and
for
some
time
afterward
the
press
was
burdened
with
replies
ponderous
and
pithy
lurid
and
vapid
vitriolic
and
unctuous
but
in
the
main
bearing
the
inevitable
characteristics
of
pleas
for
inherited
opinions
stimulated
by
ample
endowments
the
authors
of
the
book
seemed
for
a
time
likely
to
be
swept
out
of
the
church
one
of
the
least
daring
but
most
eminent
finding
himself
apparently
forsaken
seemed
though
a
man
of
very
tough
fibre
about
to
die
of
a
broken
heart
but
sturdy
english
sense
at
last
prevailed
the
storm
passed
and
afterward
came
the
still
small
voice
really
sound
thinkers
throughout
england
especially
those
who
held
no
briefs
for
conventional
orthodoxy
recognised
the
service
rendered
by
the
book
it
was
found
that
after
all
there
existed
even
among
churchmen
a
great
mass
of
public
opinion
in
favour
of
giving
a
full
hearing
to
the
reverent
expression
of
honest
thought
and
inclined
to
distrust
any
cause
which
subjected
fair
play
to
zeal
the
authors
of
the
work
not
only
remained
in
the
church
of
england
but
some
of
them
have
since
represented
the
broader
views
though
not
always
with
their
early
courage

where
the
noted
epitaph
is

richard
baron
westbury
lord
high
chancellor
of
england
he
was
an
eminent
christian
an
energetic
and
merciful
statesman
and
a
still
more
eminent
and
merciful
judge
during
his
three
years
tenure
of
office
he
abolished
the
ancient
method
of
conveying
land
the
institution
of
the
insolvent
court
and
the
eternity
of
punishment
toward
the
close
of
his
early
career
in
the
judicial
committee
of
the
privy
council
he
dismissed
hell
with
costs
and
took
away
from
the
orthodox
members
of
the
church
of
england
their
last
hope
of
everlasting
damnation
iv
the
closing
struggle
the
storm
aroused
by
essays
and
reviews
had
not
yet
subsided
when
a
far
more
serious
tempest
burst
upon
the
english
theological
world
in
appeared
a
work
entitled
the
pentateuch
and
the
book
of
joshua
critically
examined
its
author
being
colenso
anglican
bishop
of
natal
in
south
africa
he
had
formerly
been
highly
esteemed
as
fellow
and
tutor
at
cambridge
master
at
harrow
author
of
various
valuable
in
mathematics
and
as
long
as
he
exercised
his
powers
within
the
limits
of
popular
orthodoxy
he
was
evidently
in
the
way
to
the
highest
positions
in
the
church
but
he
chose
another
path
his
treatment
of
his
subject
was
reverent
but
he
had
gradually
come
to
those
conclusions
then
so
daring
now
so
widespread
among
christian
scholars
that
the
pentateuch
with
much
valuable
historical
matter
contains
much
that
is
unhistorical
that
a
large
portion
of
it
was
the
work
of
a
comparatively
late
period
in
jewish
history
that
many
passages
in
deuteronomy
could
only
have
been
written
after
the
jews
settled
in
canaan
that
the
mosaic
law
was
not
in
force
before
the
captivity
that
the
books
of
chronicles
were
clearly
written
as
an
afterthought
to
enforce
the
views
of
the
priestly
caste
and
that
in
all
the
books
there
is
much
that
is
mythical
and
legendary
very
justly
has
a
great
german
scholar
recently
adduced
this
work
of
a
churchman
relegated
to
the
most
petty
of
bishoprics
in
one
of
the
most
remote
corners
of
the
world
as
a
proof
that
the
problems
of
biblical
criticism
can
no
longer
be
suppressed
that
they
are
in
the
air
of
our
time
so
that
theology
could
not
escape
them
even
if
it
took
the
wings
of
the
morning
and
dwelt
in
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
sea
the
bishop
statements
which
now
seem
so
moderate
then
aroused
horror
especial
wrath
was
caused
by
some
of
his
arithmetical
arguments
and
among
them
those
which
showed
that
an
army
of
six
hundred
thousand
men
could
not
have
been
mobilized
in
a
single
night
that
three
millions
of
people
with
their
flocks
and
herds
could
neither
have
obtained
food
on
so
small
and
arid
a
desert
as
that
over
which
they
were
said
to
have
wandered
during
forty
years
nor
water
from
a
single
well
and
that
the
butchery
of
two
hundred
thousand
midianites
by
twelve
thousand
israelites
exceeding
infinitely
in
atrocity
the
tragedy
at
cawnpore
had
happily
only
been
carried
out
on
paper
there
was
nothing
of
the
scoffer
in
him
while
preserving
his
own
independence
he
had
kept
in
touch
with
the
most
earnest
thought
both
among
european
scholars
and
in
the
little
flock
intrusted
to
his
care
he
evidently
remembered
what
had
resulted
from
the
attempt
to
hold
the
working
classes
in
the
towns
of
france
germany
and
italy
to
outworn
beliefs
he
had
found
even
the
zulus
whom
he
thought
to
convert
suspicious
of
the
legendary
features
of
the
old
testament
and
with
his
clear
practical
mind
he
realized
the
danger
which
threatened
the
english
church
and
christianity
the
danger
of
tying
its
religion
and
morality
to
interpretations
and
conceptions
of
scripture
more
and
more
widely
seen
and
felt
to
be
contrary
to
facts
he
saw
the
especial
peril
of
sham
explanations
of
covering
up
facts
which
must
soon
be
known
and
which
when
revealed
must
inevitably
bring
the
plain
people
of
england
to
regard
their
teachers
even
the
most
deserving
as
solemnly
constituted
impostors
ecclesiastics
whose
tenure
depends
on
assertions
which
they
know
to
be
untrue
therefore
it
was
that
when
his
catechumens
questioned
him
regarding
some
of
the
old
testament
legends
the
bishop
determined
to
tell
the
truth
he
says
my
heart
answered
in
the
words
of
the
prophet
a
man
speak
lies
in
the
name
of
the
lord
i
determined
not
to
do
so
but
none
of
these
considerations
availed
in
his
behalf
at
first
the
outcry
against
the
work
was
deafening
churchmen
and
dissenters
rushed
forward
to
attack
it
archdeacon
denison
chairman
of
the
committee
of
convocation
appointed
to
examine
it
uttered
a
noisy
anathema
convocation
solemnly
condemned
it
and
a
zealous
colonial
bishop
relying
upon
a
nominal
supremacy
deposed
and
excommunicated
its
author
declaring
him
given
over
to
satan
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
the
press
groaned
with
answers
some
of
these
being
especially
injurious
to
the
cause
they
were
intended
to
serve
and
none
more
so
than
sundry
efforts
by
the
bishops
themselves
one
of
the
points
upon
which
they
attacked
him
was
his
assertion
that
the
reference
in
leviticus
to
the
hare
chewing
its
cud
contains
an
error
upon
this
hitzig
of
leipsic
one
of
the
best
hebrew
scholars
of
his
time
remarked
your
bishops
are

themselves
the
of
europe
every
hebraist
knows

the
animal
mentioned

of
the
clergy
and
laity
who
felt
grateful
for
his
years
of
devotion
to
them
received
him
with
signs
of
affection
an
attempt
was
made
to
ruin
these
clergymen
by
depriving
them
of
their
little
stipends
and
to
terrify
the
laity
by
threatening
them
with
the
same
greater
excommunication
which
had
been
inflicted
upon
their
bishop

make
the
meaning
of
this
more
evident

and
solemnly
bade
him
depart

one
who
has
been
handed
over
to
the
evil
one
the
sentence
of
excommunication
was
read
before
the
assembled
faithful
and
they
were
enjoined
to
treat
their
bishop
as
a
heathen
man
and
a
publican
but
these
and
a
long
series
of
other
persecutions
created
a
reaction
in
his
favour
there
remained
to
colenso
one
bulwark
which
his
enemies
found
stronger
than
they
had
imagined
the
british
courts
of
justice
the
greatest
efforts
were
now
made
to
gain
the
day
before
these
courts
to
humiliate
colenso
and
to
reduce
to
beggary
the
clergy
who
remained
faithful
to
him
and
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
one
of
the
leaders
in
preparing
the
legal
plea
of
the
com
mittee
against
him
was
gladstone
but
this
bulwark
proved
impregnable
both
the
judicial
committee
of
the
privy
council
and
the
rolls
court
decided
in
colenso
favour
not
only
were
his
enemies
thus
forbidden
to
deprive
him
of
his
salary
but
their
excommunication
of
him
was
made
null
and
void
it
became
indeed
a
subject
of
ridicule
and
even
a
man
so
nurtured
in
religious
sentiment
as
john
keble
confessed
and
lamented
that
the
english
people
no
longer
believed
in
excommunication
the
bitterness
of
the
defeated
found
vent
in
the
utterances
of
the
colonial
metropolitan
who
had
excommunicated
colenso
bishop
gray
the
lion
of
cape
town
who
denounced
the
judgment
as
awful
and
profane
and
the
privy
council
as
a
masterpiece
of
satan
and
the
great
dragon
of
the
english
church
even
wilberforce
careful
as
he
was
to
avoid
attacking
anything
established
alluded
with
deep
regret
to
the
devotion
of
the
english
people
to
the
law
in
matters
of
this
sort
their
failure
in
the
courts
only
seemed
to
increase
the
violence
of
the
attacking
party
the
anglican
communion
both
in
england
and
america
was
stirred
to
its
depths
against
the
heretic
and
various
dissenting
bodies
strove
to
show
equal
zeal
great
pains
were
taken
to
root
out
his
reputation
it
was
declared
that
he
had
merely
stolen
the
ideas
of
rationalists
on
the
continent
by
wholesale
and
peddled
them
out
in
england
at
retail
the
fact
being
that
while
he
used
all
the
sources
of
information
at
his
command
and
was
enough
to
put
himself
into
relations
with
the
best
biblical
scholarship
of
the
continent
he
was
singularly
independent
in
his
judgment
and
that
his
investigations
were
of
lasting
value
in
modifying
continental
thought

most
distinguished

to

with
and
as
to
the
opinion

i
need
only
say
that
inasmuch
as
ewald

were
every
one
of
them
logically
forced
to
revise
their
theories
in
the
light
of
the
english
bishop
research
there
was
small
reason
in
the
cry
that
his
methods
were
antiquated
and
his
objections
stale
for
a
very
brief
but
effective
tribute
to
colenso
as
an
independent
thinker
whose
merits
are
now
acknowledged
by
continental
scholars
see
pfleiderer

of
theory
as
above
but
the
zeal
of
the
bishop
enemies
did
not
end
with
calumny
he
was
socially
ostracized
more
completely

than

of

and
people
of

books
in

a
large
part
of
the
english
populace
was
led
to
regard
him
as
an
infidel
a
traitor
an
apostate
and
even
as
an
unclean
being
servants
left
his
house
in
horror
tray
blanche

were
let
loose
upon
him
and
one
of
the
favourite
amusements
of
the
period
among
men
of
petty
wit
and
no
convictions
was
the
devising
of
light
ribaldry
against
him
one
of
the
nonsense
verses
in
vogue
at
the
time
summed
up
the
controversy

quite
as
good
appeared
on

of

being
as

is
this
then

colenso

bishops
offends

said

on

see
macmillan
magazine
january
for
maurice
see
the
references
already
given
in
the
midst
of
all
this
controversy
stood
three
men
each
of
whom
has
connected
his
name
with
it
permanently
first
of
these
was
samuel
wilberforce
at
that
time
bishop
of
oxford
the
gifted
son
of
william
wilberforce
who
had
been
honoured
throughout
the
world
for
his
efforts
in
the
suppression
of
the
slave
trade
he
had
been
rapidly
advanced
in
the
english
church
and
was
at
this
time
a
prelate
of
wide
influence
he
was
eloquent
and
diplomatic
witty
and
amiable
always
sure
to
be
with
his
and
polite
society
against
uncomfortable
changes
whether
the
struggle
was
against
the
slave
power
in
the
united
states
or
the
squirearchy
in
great
britain
or
the
evolution
theory
of
darwin
or
the
new
views
promulgated
by
the
essayists
and
reviewers
he
was
always
the
suave
spokesman
of
those
who
opposed
every
innovator
and
besought
him
to
depart
out
of
their
coasts
mingling
in
curious
proportions
a
truly
religious
feeling
with
care
for
his
own
advancement
his
remarkable
power
in
the
pulpit
gave
him
great
strength
to
carry
out
his
purposes
and
his
charming
facility
in
being
all
things
to
all
men
as
well
as
his
skill
in
evading
the
consequences
of
his
many
mistakes
gained
him
the
sobriquet
of
soapy
sam
if
such
brethren
of
his
in
the
episcopate
as
thirlwall
and
selwyn
and
tait
might
claim
to
be
in
the
apostolic
succession
wilberforce
was
no
less
surely
in
the
succession
from
the
most
gifted
and
eminently
respectable
sadducees
who
held
high
preferment
under
pontius
pilate
by
a
curious
coincidence
he
had
only
a
few
years
before
preached
the
sermon
when
colenso
was
consecrated
in
westminster
abbey
and
one
passage
in
it
may
be
cited
as
showing
the
preacher
gift
of
prophecy
both
hortatory
and
predictive
wilberforce
then
said
to
colenso
you
need
boldness
to
risk
all
for
god
to
stand
by
the
truth
and
its
supporters
against
men
threatenings
and
the
devil
wrath
you
need
a
patient
meekness
to
bear
the
galling
calumnies
and
false
surmises
with
which
if
you
are
faithful
that
same
satanic
working
which
if
it
could
would
burn
your
body
will
assuredly
assail
you
daily
through
the
pens
and
tongues
of
deceivers
and
deceived
who
under
a
semblance
of
a
zeal
for
christ
will
evermore
distort
your
words
misrepresent
your
motives
rejoice
in
your
failings
exaggerate
your
errors
and
seek
by
every
poisoned
breath
of
slander
to
destroy
your
powers
of
service
for
the
social
ostracism
of
colenso

of

persecutors

to
men

measures

redressed

prelates

more
and
more
of
all
men
as
a
righteous
leader
in
a
noble
effort
to
cut
the
church
loose
from
fatal
entanglements
with
an
outworn
system
of
interpretation
wilberforce

the
remembrance

eloquence

his
personal
charm
dies
away
and
as
the
revelations
of
his
indiscreet
biographers
lay
bare
his
modes
of
procedure
is
seen
to
have
left
on
the
whole
the
most
disappointing
record
made
by
any
anglican
prelate
during
the
nineteenth
century
but
there
was
a
far
brighter
page
in
the
history
of
the
church
of
england
for
the
second
of
the
three
who
linked
their
names
with
that
of
colenso
in
the
struggle
was
arthur
penrhyn
stanley
dean
of
westminster
his
action
during
this
whole
persecution
was
an
honour
not
only
to
the
anglican
church
but
to
humanity
for
his
own
manhood
and
the
exercise
of
his
own
intellectual
freedom
he
had
cheerfully
given
up
the
high
preferment
in
the
church
which
had
been
easily
within
his
grasp
to
him
truth
and
justice
were
more
than
the
decrees
of
a
convocation
of
canterbury
or
of
a
synod
in
this
as
in
other
matters
he
braved
the
storm
never
yielded
to
theological
prejudice
from
first
to
last
held
out
a
brotherly
hand
to
the
persecuted
bishop
and
at
the
most
critical
moment
opened
to
him
the
pulpit
of
westminster
abbey
for
interesting
testimony
to
stanley
character
from
a
quarter
from
whence
it
would
have
been
least
expected
see
a
reminiscence
of
lord
shaftesbury
in
the
life
of
frances
power
cobbe
london
and
new
york
the
late
bishop
of
massachusetts
phillips
brooks
whose
death
was
a
bereavement
to
his
country
and
to
the
church
universal
once
gave
the
present
writer
a
vivid
description
of
a
scene
witnessed
by
him
in
the
convocation
of
canterbury
when
stanley
virtually
withstood
alone
the
obstinate
traditionalism
of
the
whole
body
in
the
matter
of
the
athanasian
creed
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
this
account
may
be
brought
to
light
among
the
letters
written
by
brooks
at
that
time
see
also
dean
church
life
and
letters
for
a
very
important
testimony
the
third
of
the
high
ecclesiastics
of
the
church
of
england
whose
names
were
linked
in
this
contest
was
thirlwall
he
was
undoubtedly
the
foremost
man
in
the
church
of
his
time
the
greatest
ecclesiastical
statesman
the
profoundest
historical
scholar
the
theologian
of
clearest
vision
in
regard
to
the
relations
between
the
church
and
his
epoch
alone
among
his
brother
bishops
at
this
period
he
stood
four
square
to
all
the
winds
that
blew
as
during
all
his
life
he
stood
against
all
storms
of
clerical
or
popular
unreason
he
had
his
reward
he
was
never
advanced
beyond
a
poor
welsh
bishopric
but
though
he
saw
men
wretchedly
inferior
constantly
promoted
beyond
him
he
never
flinched
never
lost
heart
or
hope
but
bore
steadily
on
refusing
to
hold
a
brief
for
lucrative
injustice
and
resisting
to
the
last
all
reaction
and
fanaticism
thus
preserving
not
only
his
own
but
the
future
respect
of
the
english
nation
for
the
church
a
few
other
leading
churchmen
were
discreetly
kind
to
colenso
among
them
tait
who
had
now
been
made
archbishop
of
canterbury
but
manly
as
he
was
he
was
somewhat
more
cautious
in
this
matter
than
those
who
most
revere
his
memory
could
now
wish
in
spite
of
these
friends
the
clerical
onslaught
was
for
a
time
effective
colenso
so
far
as
england
was
concerned
was
discredited
and
virtually
driven
from
his
functions
but
this
enforced
leisure
simply
gave
him
more
time
to
struggle
for
the
protection
of
his
native
flock
against
colonial
rapacity
and
to
continue
his
great
work
on
the
bible
his
work
produced
its
effect
it
had
much
to
do
with
arousing
a
new
generation
of
english
scotch
and
american
scholars
while
very
many
of
his
minor
statements
have
since
been
modified
or
rejected
his
main
conclusion
was
seen
more
and
more
clearly
to
be
true
reverently
and
in
the
deepest
love
for
christianity
he
had
made
the
unhistorical
character
of
the
pentateuch
clear
as
noonday
henceforth
the
crushing
weight
of
the
old
interpretation
upon
science
and
morality
and
religion
steadily
and
rapidly
grew
less
and
less
that
a
new
epoch
had
come
was
evident
and
out
of
many
proofs
of
this
we
may
note
two
of
the
most
striking
for
many
years
the
bampton
lectures
at
oxford
had
been
considered
as
adding
steadily
and
strongly
to
the
bulwarks
of
the
old
orthodoxy
if
now
and
then
orthodoxy
had
appeared
in
danger
from
such
additions
to
the
series
as
those
made
by
hampden
these
lectures
had
been
as
a
rule
saturated
with
the
older
traditions
of
the
anglican
church
but
now
there
was
an
evident
change
the
departures
from
the
old
paths
were
many
and
striking
until
at
last
in
came
the
lectures
on
inspiration
by
the
rev
sanday
ireland
professor
of
exegesis
in
the
university
of
oxford
in
these
concessions
were
made
to
the
newer
criticism
which
at
an
earlier
time
would
have
driven
the
lecturer
not
only
out
of
the
church
but
out
of
any
decent
position
in
society
for
sanday
not
only
gave
up
a
vast
mass
of
other
ideas
which
the
great
body
of
churchmen
had
regarded
as
fundamental
but
accepted
a
number
of
conclusions
established
by
the
newer
criticism
he
declared
that
kuenen
and
wellhausen
had
mapped
out
on
the
whole
rightly
the
main
stages
of
development
in
the
history
of
hebrew
literature
he
incorporated
with
approval
the
work
of
other
eminent
heretics
he
acknowledged
that
very
many
statements
in
the
pentateuch
show
the
naive
ideas
and
usages
of
a
primitive
age
but
most
important
of
all
he
gave
up
the
whole
question
in
regard
to
the
book
of
daniel
up
to
a
time
then
very
recent
the
early
authorship
and
predictive
character
of
the
book
of
daniel
were
things
which
no
one
was
allowed
for
a
moment
to
dispute
pusey
as
we
have
seen
had
proved
to
the
controlling
parties
in
the
english
church
that
christianity
must
stand
or
fall
with
the
traditional
view
of
this
book
and
now
within
a
few
years
of
pusey
death
there
came
in
his
own
university
speaking
from
the
pulpit
of
mary
whence
he
had
so
often
insisted
upon
the
absolute
necessity
of
maintaining
the
older
view
this
professor
of
biblical
criticism
a
doctor
of
divinity
showing
conclusively
as
regards
the
book
of
daniel
that
the
critical
view
had
won
the
day
that
the
name
of
daniel
is
only
assumed
that
the
book
is
in
no
sense
predictive
but
was
written
mainly
at
least
after
the
events
it
describes
that
its
author
lived
at
the
time
of
the
maccabean
struggle
that
it
is
very
inaccurate
even
in
the
simple
facts
which
it
cites
and
hence
that
all
the
vast
fabric
erected
upon
its
predictive
character
is
baseless
but
another
evidence
of
the
coming
in
of
a
new
epoch
was
even
more
striking
to
uproot
every
growth
of
the
newer
thought
to
destroy
even
every
germ
that
had
been
planted
by
colenso
and
men
like
him
a
special
movement
was
begun
of
which
the
most
important
part
was
the
establishment
at
the
university
of
oxford
of
a
college
which
should
bring
the
old
opinion
with
crushing
force
against
the
new
thought
and
should
train
up
a
body
of
young
men
by
feeding
them
upon
the
utterances
of
the
fathers
of
the
medieval
doctors
and
of
the
apologists
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
and
should
keep
them
in
happy
ignorance
of
the
reforming
spirit
of
the
sixteenth
and
the
scientific
spirit
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
new
college
thus
founded
bore
the
name

of

one
of

the

of
the

that
there
is
a
considerable
idealizing
element
in

history
that
the

of

show
an
idealizing
of

a

he
had
arrived
in

way
at

much
like

he
presented
the
newer
view
with
fearless
honesty
admitting
that
the
same
research
must
be
applied
to
these
as
to
other
oriental
sacred
books
and
that
such
research
establishes
the
fact
that
all
alike
contain
legendary
and
mythical
elements

aroused
certain

this
very
important
work
of
reference
which
had

so
timid
was
now
arrayed
on
the
side
of
the
newer
thought
insuring
its
due
consideration
wherever
the
english
language
is
spoken
in
france
the
same
tendency
was
seen
though
with
striking
variations
from
the
course
of
events
in
other
countries
variations
due
to
the
very
different
conditions
under
which
biblical
students
in
france
were
obliged
to
work
down
to
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
orthodoxy
of
bossuet
stiffly
opposing
the
letter
of
scripture
to
every
step
in
the
advance
of
science
had
only
yielded
in
a
very
slight
degree
but
then
came
an
event
ushering
in
a
new
epoch
at
that
time
jules
simon
afterward
so
eminent
as
an
author
academician
and
statesman
was
quietly
discharging
the
duties
of
a
professorship
when
there
was
brought
him
the
visiting
card
of
a
stranger
bearing
the
name
of
ernest
renan
student
at
st
sulpice
admitted
to
library
renan
told
his
story
as
a
theological
student
he
had
devoted
himself
most
earnestly
even
before
he
entered
the
seminary
to
the
study
of
hebrew
and
the
semitic
languages
and
he
was
now
obliged
during
the
lectures
on
biblical
literature
at
sulpice
to
hear
the
reverend
professor
make
frequent
comments
based
on
the
vulgate
but
absolutely
disproved
by
renan
own
knowledge
of
hebrew
on
questioning
any
interpretation
of
the
lecturer
the
latter
was
wont
to
rejoin
monsieur
do
you
presume
to
deny
the
authority
of
the
vulgate
the
translation
by
jerome
sanctioned
by
the
holy
ghost
and
the
church
you
will
at
once
go
into
the
chapel
and
say
mary
for
an
hour
before
the
image
of
the
blessed
virgin
but
said
renan
to
jules
simon
this
has
now
become
very
serious
it
happens
nearly
every
day
and
mon
dieu
monsieur
i
can
not
spend
all
my
time
in
saying
hail
mary
before
the
statue
of
the
virgin
the
result
was
a
warm
personal
attachment
between
simon
and
renan
both
were
bretons
educated
in
the
midst
of
the
most
orthodox
influences
and
both
had
unwillingly
broken
away
from
them
renan
was
now
emancipated
and
pursued
his
studies
with
such
effect
that
he
was
made
professor
at
the
college
de
france
his
life
of
jesus
and
other
books
showing
the
same
spirit
brought
a
tempest
upon
him
which
drove
him
from
his
professorship
and
brought
great
hardships
upon
him
for
many
years
but
his
genius
carried
the
day
and
to
the
honour
of
the
french
republic
he
was
restored
to
the
position
from
which
the
empire
had
driven
him
from
his
pen
finally
appeared
the
histoire
du
peuple
israel
in
which
scholarship
broad
though
at
times
inaccurate
in
minor
details
was
supplemented
by
an
exquisite
acuteness
and
a
poetic
insight
which
far
more
than
made
good
any
of
those
lesser
errors
which
a
german
student
would
have
avoided
at
his
death
in
october
this
monumental
work
had
been
finished
in
clearness
and
beauty
of
style
it
has
never
been
approached
by
any
other
treatise
on
this
or
any
kindred
subject
it
is
a
work
of
genius
and
its
profound
insight
into
all
that
is
of
importance
in
the
great
subjects
which
he
treated
will
doubtless
cause
it
to
hold
a
permanent
place
in
the
literature
not
only
of
the
latin
nations
but
of
the
world
an
interesting
light
is
thrown
over
the
history
of
advancing
thought
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
by
the
fact
that
this
most
detested
of
heresiarchs
was
summoned
to
receive
the
highest
of
academic
honours
at
the
university
which
for
ages
had
been
regarded
as
a
stronghold
of
presbyterian
orthodoxy
in
great
britain
in
france
the
anathemas
lavished
upon
him
by
church
authorities
during
his
life
their
denial
to
him
of
christian
burial
and
their
refusal
to
allow
him
a
grave
in
the
place
he
most
loved
only
increased
popular
affection
for
him
during
his
last
years
and
deepened
the
general
mourning
at
his
death
for
a
remarkably
just
summary
of
renan
work
eminently
judicial
and
at
the
same
time
deeply
appreciative

the
deep
and
hearty
evidences
of
gratitude
and
respect
then
paid
to
renan
not
merely
by
eminent
orators
and
scholars
but
by
the
people
at
large
as
to
the
refusal
of
the
place
of
burial
that
renan
especially
chose
see
his
own
souvenirs
in
which
he
laments
the
inevitable
exclusion
of
his
grave
from
the
site
which
he
most
loved
as
to
calumnies
one
masterpiece
very
widely
spread
through
the
zeal
of
clerical
journals
was
that
renan
received
enormous
sums
from
the
rothschilds
for
attacking
christianity
in
spite
of
all
resistance
the
desire
for
more
light
upon
the
sacred
books
penetrated
the
older
church
from
every
side
in
germany
toward
the
close
of
the
eighteenth
century

catholic
professor
at

had
endeavoured
in
a
similar
introduction
to
bring
modern
research
to
bear
on
the
older
view
but
the
church
authorities
took
care
to
have
all
passages
really
giving
any
new
light
skilfully
and
speedily
edited
out
of
the
book
later
still
movers
professor
at
breslau
showed
remarkable
gifts
for
old
testament
research
and
much
was
expected
of
him
but
his
ecclesiastical
superiors
quietly
prevented
his
publishing
any
extended
work
during
the
latter
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
much
the
same
pressure
has
continued
in
catholic
germany
strong
scholars
have
very
generally
been
drawn
into
the
position
of
apologists
or
reconcilers
and
when
found
intractable
they
have
been
driven
out
of
the
church
the
same
general
policy
had
been
evident
in
france
and
italy
but
toward
the
last
decade
of
the
century
it
was
seen
by
the
more
supporters
of
the
older
church
in
those
countries
that
the
multifarious
refutations
and
explosive
attacks
upon
renan
and
his
teachings
had
accomplished
nothing
that
even
special
services
of
atonement
for
his
sin
like
the
famous
triduo
at
florence
only
drew
a
few
women
and
provoked
ridicule
among
the
public
at
large
that
throwing
him
out
of
his
professorship
and
calumniating
him
had
but
increased
his
influence
and
that
his
brilliant
intuitions
added
to
the
careful
researches
of
german
and
english
scholars
had
brought
the
thinking
world
beyond
the
reach
of
the
old
methods
of
hiding
troublesome
truths
and
crushing
persistent
therefore
it
was
that
about
a
body
of
earnest
roman
catholic
scholars
began
very
cautiously
to
examine
and
explain
the
biblical
text
in
the
light
of
those
results
of
the
newer
research
which
could
no
longer
be
gainsaid
among
these
men
were

bartolo

berta
and
father
savi
and
in
france
monseigneur
the
abbe
loisy
professor
at
the
roman

and
most
eminent
of
all
professor
lenormant
of
the
french
institute
whose
researches
into
biblical
and
other
ancient
history
and
literature
had
won
him
distinction
throughout
the
world
these
men
while
standing
up
manfully
for
the
church
were
obliged
to
allow
that
some
of
the
conclusions
of
modern
biblical
criticism
were
well
founded
the
result
came
rapidly
the
treatise
of
bartolo
and
the
great
work
of
lenormant
were
placed
on
the
index
canon
berta
was
overwhelmed
with
reproaches
and
virtually
silenced
the
abbe
loisy
was
first
deprived
of
his
professorship
and
then
ignominiously
expelled
from
the
university
monseigneur
was
summoned
to

and
may
the
ghastly
part
of
the
record
as
stated
in
this

is
that
both
these
great
scholars
were
forced
to
abjure
their
errors
and
to
acquiesce
in
the
condemnation
lenorment
doing
this
on
his

the
matter
was
evidently
thought
serious
in
the
higher
regions
of
the
church
for
in
november
appeared
an
encyclical
letter
by
the
reigning
pope
leo
xiii
on
the
study
of
sacred
scripture
much
was
expected
from
it
for
since
benedict
xiv
in
the
last
century
there
had
sat
on
the
papal
throne
no
pope
intellectually
so
competent
to
discuss
the
whole
subject
while
then
those
devoted
to
the
older
beliefs
trusted
that
the
papal
thunderbolts
would
crush
the
whole
brood
of
biblical
critics
votaries
of
the
newer
thought
ventured
to
hope
that
the
encyclical
might
in
the
language
of
one
of
them
prove
a
stupendous
bridge
spanning
the
broad
abyss
that
now
divides
alleged
orthodoxy
from
established
science
for
this
statement
see
an
article
in
the
contemporary
review
april
both
these
expectations
were
disappointed
and
yet
on
the
whole
it
is
a
question
whether
the
world
at
large
may
not
congratulate
itself
upon
this
papal
utterance
the
document
if
not
apostolic
won
credit
as
statesmanlike
it
took
pains
of
course
to
insist
that
there
can
be
no
error
of
any
sort
in
the
sacred
books
it
even
defended
those
parts
which
protestants
count
apocryphal
as
thoroughly
as
the
remainder
of
scripture
and
declared
that
the
book
of
tobit
was
not
compiled
of
man
but
written
by
god
his
holiness
naturally
condemned
the
higher
criticism
but
he
dwelt
at
the
same
time
on
the
necessity
of
the
most
thorough
study
of
the
sacred
scriptures
and
especially
on
the
importance
of
adjusting
scriptural
statements
to
scientific
facts
this
utterance
was
admirably
oracular
being
susceptible
of
cogent
quotation
by
both
sides
nothing
could
be
in
better
form
from
an
orthodox
point
of
view
but
with
that
statesmanlike
forecast
which
the
present
pope
has
shown
more
than
once
in
steering
the
bark
of
peter
over
the
troubled
waves
of
the
nineteenth
century
he
so
far
abstained
from
condemning
any
of
the
greater
results
of
modern
critical
study
that
the
main
english
defender
of
the
encyclical
the
jesuit
father
clarke
did
not
hesitate
publicly
to
admit
a
multitude
of
such
results
results
indeed
which
would
shock
not
only
italian
and
spanish
catholics
but
many
english
and
american
protestants
according
to
this
interpreter
the
pope
had
no
thought
of
denying
the
variety
of
documents
in
the
pentateuch
or
the
plurality
of
sources
of
the
books
of
samuel
or
the
twofold
authorship
of
isaiah
or
that
all
after
the
ninth
verse
of
the
last
chapter
of
mark
gospel
is
spurious
and
as
regards
the
whole
encyclical
the
distinguished
jesuit
dwelt
significantly
on
the
power
of
the
papacy
at
any
time
to
define
out
of
existence
any
previous
decisions
which
may
be
found
inconvenient
more
than
that
father
clarke
himself
while
standing
as
the
champion
of
the
most
thorough
orthodoxy
acknowledged
that
in
the
old
testament
numbers
must
be
expected
to
be
used
orientally
and
that
all
these
seventies
and
forties
as
for
example
when
absalom
is
said
to
have
rebelled
against
david
for
forty
years
can
not
possibly
be
meant
numerically
and
what
must
have
given
a
fearful
shock
to
some
protestant
believers
in
plenary
inspiration
he
while
advocating
it
as
a
dutiful
son
of
the
church
wove
over
it
an
exquisite
web
with
the
declaration
that
there
is
a
human
element
in
the
bible
for
by
the
divine
for
these
admissions
of
father
clarke
see
his
article
the
papal
encyclical
on
the
bible
in
the
contemporary
review
for
july
considering
the
difficulties
in
the
case
the
world
has
reason
to
be
grateful
to
pope
leo
and
father
clarke
for
these
utterances
which
perhaps
after
all
may
prove
a
better
bridge
between
the
old
and
the
new
than
could
have
been
framed
by
engineers
more
learned
but
less
astute
evidently
pope
leo
xiii
is
neither
a
paul
v
nor
an
urban
viii
and
is
too
wise
to
bring
the
church
into
a
position
from
which
it
can
only
be
extricated
by
such
ludicrous
subterfuges
as
those
by
which
it
was
dragged
out
of
the
galileo
scandal
or
by
such
a
tortuous
policy
as
that
by
which
it
writhed
out
of
the
old
doctrine
regarding
the
taking
of
interest
for
money
in
spite
then
of
the
attempted
crushing
out
of
bartolo
and
berta
and
savi
and
lenormant
and
loisy
during
this
very
epoch
in
which
the
pope
issued
this
encyclical
there
is
every
reason
to
hope
that
the
path
has
been
paved
over
which
the
church
may
gracefully
recede
from
the
old
system
of
interpretation
and
quietly
accept
and
appropriate
the
main
results
of
the
higher
criticism
certainly
she
has
never
had
a
better
opportunity
to
play
at
the
game
of
beggar
my
neighbour
and
to
drive
the
older
protestant
orthodoxy
into
bankruptcy
in
america
the
same
struggle
between
the
old
ideas
and
the
new
went
on
in
the
middle
years
of
the
century
the
first
adequate
effort
in
behalf
of
the
newer
conception
of
the
sacred
books
was
made
by
theodore
parker
at
boston
a
thinker
brave
and
of
the
widest
range
a
scholar
indefatigable
and
of
the
deepest
sympathies
with
humanity
a
man
called
by
one
of
the
most
eminent
scholars
in
the
english
church
a
religious
titan
and
by
a
distinguished
french
theologian
a
prophet
he
had
struggled
on
from
the
divinity
school
until
at
that
time
he
was
one
of
the
foremost
biblical
scholars
and
preacher
to
the
largest
regular
congregation
on
the
american
continent
the
great
hall
in
boston
could
seat
four
thousand
people
and
at
his
regular
discourses
every
part
of
it
was
filled
in
addition
to
his
pastoral
work
he
wielded
a
vast
influence
as
a
platform
speaker
especially
in
opposition
to
the
extension
of
slavery
into
the
territories
of
the
united
states
and
as
a
lecturer
on
a
wide
range
of
vital
topics
and
among
those
whom
he
most
profoundly
influenced
both
politically
and
religiously
was
abraham
lincoln
during
each
year
at
that
period
he
was
heard
discussing
the
most
important
religious
and
political
questions
in
all
the
greater
northern
cities
but
his
most
lasting
work
was
in
throwing
light
upon
our
sacred
scriptures
and
in
this
he
was
one
of
the
forerunners
of
the
movement
now
going
on
not
only
in
the
united
states
but
throughout
christendom
even
before
he
was
fairly
out
of
college
his
translation
of
de
wette
introduction
to
the
old
testament
made
an
impression
on
many
thoughtful
men
his
sermon
in
on
the
transient
and
permanent
in
christianity
marked
the
beginning
of
his
great
individual
career
his
speeches
his
lectures
and
especially
his
discourse
on
matters
pertaining
to
religion
greatly
extended
his
influence
his
was
a
deeply
devotional
nature
and
his
public
prayers
exercised
by
their
touching
beauty
a
very
strong
religious
influence
upon
his
audiences
he
had
his
reward
beautiful
and
noble
as
were
his
life
and
his
he
was
widely
abhorred
on
one
occasion
of
public
worship
in
one
of
the
more
orthodox
churches
news
having
been
received
that
he
was
dangerously
ill
a
prayer
was
openly
made
by
one
of
the
zealous
brethren
present
that
this
might
be
removed
from
earth
he
was
even
driven
out
from
the
unitarian
body
but
he
was
none
the
less
steadfast
and
bold
and
the
great
mass
of
men
and
women
who
thronged
his
audience
room
at
boston
and
his
lecture
rooms
in
other
cities
spread
his
ideas
his
fate
was
pathetic
full
of
faith
and
hope
but
broken
prematurely
by
his
labours
he
retired
to
italy
and
died
there
at
the
darkest
period
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
when
slavery
in
the
state
and
the
older
orthodoxy
in
the
church
seemed
absolutely
and
forever
triumphant
the
death
of
moses
within
sight
of
the
promised
land
seems
the
only
parallel
to
the
death
of
parker
less
than
six
months
before
the
publication
of
essays
and
reviews
and
the
election
of
abraham
lincoln
to
the
presidency
of
the
united
states
for
the
appellation
religious
titan
applied
to
theodore
parker

regarding
parker
audiences
and
his
power
over
them
the
present
writer
trusts
to
his
own
memory
but
here
it
must
be
noted
that
parker
effort
was
powerfully
aided
by
the
conscientious
utterances
of
some
of
his
foremost
opponents
nothing
during
the
american
struggle
against
the
slave
system
did
more
to
wean
religious
and
men
and
women
from
the
old
interpretation
of
scripture
than
the
use
of
it
to
justify
slavery
typical
among
examples
of
this
use
were
the
arguments
of
hopkins
bishop
of
vermont
a
man
whose
noble
character
and
beautiful
culture
gave
him
very
wide
influence
in
all
branches
of
the
american
protestant
church
while
avowing
his
personal
dislike
to
slavery
he
demonstrated
that
the
bible
sanctioned
it
other
theologians
catholic
and
protestant
took
the
same
ground
and
then
came
that
tremendous
rejoinder
which
echoed
from
heart
to
heart
throughout
the
northern
states
the
bible
sanctions
slavery
so
much
the
worse
for
the
bible
then
was
fulfilled
that
old
saying
of
bishop
ulrich
of
augsburg
press
not
the
breasts
of
holy
writ
too
hard
lest
they
yield
blood
rather
than
milk
there
is
a
curious
reference
to
bishop
hopkins
ideas
on
slavery
in
archbishop
tait
life
and
letters
for
a
succinct
statement
of
the
biblical
proslavery
argument
referred
to
see
rhodes
as
above
vol
i
pp
et
seq
yet
throughout
christendom
a
change
in
the
mode
of
interpreting
scripture
though
absolutely
necessary
if
its
proper
authority
was
to
be
maintained
still
seemed
almost
hopeless
even
after
the
foremost
scholars
had
taken
ground
in
favour
of
it
and
the
most
conservative
of
those
whose
opinions
were
entitled
to
weight
had
made
concessions
showing
the
old
ground
to
be
untenable
there
was
fanatical
opposition
to
any
change
the
syllabus
of
errors
put
forth
by
pius
ix
in
as
well
as
certain
other
documents
issued
from
the
vatican
had
increased
the
difficulties
of
this
needed
transition
and
while
the
more
roman
catholic
scholars
skilfully
explained
away
the
obstacles
thus
created
others
published
works
insisting
upon
the
most
extreme
views
as
to
the
verbal
inspiration
of
the
sacred
books
in
the
church
of
england
various
influential
men
took
the
same
view
baylee
principal
of
aidan
college
declared
that
in
scripture
every
scientific
statement
is
infallibly
accurate
all
its
histories
and
narrations
of
every
kind
are
without
any
inaccuracy
its
words
and
phrases
have
a
grammatical
and
philological
accuracy
such
as
is
possessed
by
no
human
composition
in
dean
burgon
preached
in
christ
church
cathedral
oxford
as
follows
no
sirs
the
bible
is
the
very
utterance
of
the
eternal
as
much
god
own
word
as
if
high
heaven
were
open
and
we
heard
god
speaking
to
us
with
human
voice
every
book
is
inspired
alike
and
is
inspired
entirely
inspiration
is
not
a
difference
of
degree
but
of
kind
the
bible
is
filled
to
overflowing
with
the
holy
spirit
of
god
the
books
of
it
and
the
words
of
it
and
the
very
letters
of
it
in
canon
macneile
declared
in
exeter
hall
that
we
must
either
receive
the
verbal
inspiration
of
the
old
testament
or
deny
the
veracity
the
insight
the
integrity
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
as
a
teacher
of
divine
truth
as
late
as
one
of
the
two
most
eloquent
pulpit
orators
in
the
church
of
england
canon
liddon
preaching
at
paul
cathedral
used
in
his
fervour
the
same
dangerous
argument
that
the
authority
of
christ
himself
and
therefore
of
christianity
must
rest
on
the
old
view
of
the
old
testament
that
since
the
founder
of
christianity
in
divinely
recorded
utterances
alluded
to
the
transformation
of
lot
wife
into
a
pillar
of
salt
to
noah
ark
and
the
flood
and
to
the
sojourn
of
jonah
in
the
whale
the
biblical
account
of
these
must
be
accepted
as
historical
or
that
christianity
must
be
given
up
altogether
in
the
light
of
what
was
rapidly
becoming
known
regarding
the
chaldean
and
other
sources
of
the
accounts
given
in
genesis
no
argument
could
be
more
fraught
with
peril
to
the
interest
which
the
gifted
preacher
sought
to
serve
in
france
and
germany
many
similar
utterances
in
opposition
to
the
newer
biblical
studies
were
heard
and
from
america
especially
from
the
college
at
princeton
came
resounding
echoes
as
an
example
of
many
may
be
quoted
the
statement
by
the
eminent
hodge
that
the
books
of
scripture
are
one
and
all
in
thought
and
verbal
expression
in
substance
and
in
form
wholly
the
work
of
god
conveying
with
absolute
accuracy
and
divine
authority
all
that
god
meant
to
convey
without
human
additions
and
admixtures
and
that
infallibility
and
authority
attach
as
much
to
the
verbal
expression
in
which
the
revelation
is
made
as
to
the
matter
of
the
revelation
itself
but
the
newer
thought
moved
steadily
on
as
already
in
protestant
europe
so
now
in
the
protestant
churches
of
america
it
took
strong
hold
on
the
foremost
minds
in
many
of
the
churches
known
as
orthodox
toy
briggs
francis
brown
evans
preserved
smith
moore
haupt
harper
peters
and
bacon
developed
it
and
though
most
of
them
were
opposed
bitterly
by
synods
councils
and
other
authorities
of
their
respective
churches
they
were
manfully
supported
by
the
more
intellectual
clergy
and
laity
the
greater
universities
of
the
country
ranged
themselves
on
the
side
of
these
men
persecution
but
intrenched
them
more
firmly
in
the
hearts
of
all
intelligent
of
christianity
the
triumphs
won
by
their
opponents
in
assemblies
synods
conventions
and
conferences
were
really
victories
for
the
nominally
defeated
since
they
revealed
to
the
world
the
fact
that
in
each
of
these
bodies
the
strong
and
fruitful
thought
of
the
church
the
thought
which
alone
can
have
any
hold
on
the
future
was
with
the
new
race
of
thinkers
no
theological
triumphs
more
surely
fatal
to
the
victors
have
been
won
since
the
vatican
defeated
copernicus
and
galileo
and
here
reference
must
be
made
to
a
series
of
events
which
in
the
second
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
have
contributed
most
powerful
aid
to
the
new
school
of
biblical
research
victory
of
the
scientific
and
literary
methods
while
this
struggle
for
the
new
truth
was
going
on
in
various
fields
aid
appeared
from
a
quarter
whence
it
was
least
expected
the
great
discoveries
by
botta
and
layard
in
assyria
were
supplemented
by
the
researches
of
rawlinson
george
smith
oppert
sayce
sarzec
pinches
and
others
and
thus
it
was
revealed
more
clearly
than
ever
before
that
as
far
back
as
the
time
assigned
in
genesis
to
the
creation
a
great
civilization
was
flourishing
in
mesopotamia
that
long
ages
probably
two
thousand
years
before
the
scriptural
date
assigned
to
the
migration
of
abraham
from
ur
of
the
chaldees
this
chaldean
civilization
had
bloomed
forth
in
art
science
and
literature
that
the
ancient
inscriptions
recovered
from
the
sites
of
this
and
kindred
civilizations
presented
the
hebrew
sacred
myths
and
legends
in
earlier
forms
forms
long
antedating
those
given
in
the
hebrew
scriptures
and
that
the
accounts
of
the
creation
the
tree

life
in
eden
the
institution
and
even
the
name
of
the
sabbath
the
deluge
the
tower
of
babel
and
much
else
in
the
pentateuch
were
simply
an
evolution
out
of
earlier
chaldean
myths
and
legends
so
perfect
was
the
proof
of
this
that
the
most
eminent
scholars
in
the
foremost
seats
of
christian
learning
were
obliged
to
acknowledge
it
as
to
the
revelations

english
edition
the
more
general
conclusions
which
were
thus
given
to
biblical
criticism
were
all
the
more
impressive
from
the
fact
that
they
had
been
revealed
by
various
groups
of
earnest
christian
scholars
working
on
different
lines
by
different
methods
and
in
various
parts
of
the
world
very
honourable
was
the
full
and
frank
testimony
to
these
results
given
in
by
the
rev
francis
brown
a
professor
in
the
presbyterian
theological
seminary
at
new
york
in
his
admirable
though
brief
book
on
assyriology
starting
with
the
declaration
that
it
is
a
great
pity
to
be
afraid
of
facts
he
showed
how
assyrian
research
testifies
in
many
ways
to
the
historical
value
of
the
bible
record
but
at
the
same
time
he
freely
allowed
to
chaldean
history
an
antiquity
fatal
to
the
sacred
chronology
of
the
hebrews
he
also
cast
aside
a
mass
of
doubtful
apologetics
and
dealt
frankly
with
the
fact
that
very
many
of
the
early
narratives
in
genesis
belong
to
the
common
stock
of
ancient
tradition
and
mentioning
as
an
example
the
cuneiform
inscriptions
which
record
a
story
of
the
accadian
king
sargon
how
he
was
born
in
retirement
placed
by
his
mother
in
a
basket
of
rushes
launched
on
a
river
rescued
and
brought
up
by
a
stranger
after
which
he
became
king
he
did
not
hesitate
to
remind
his
readers
that
sargon
lived
a
thousand
years
and
more
before
moses
that
this
story
was
told
of
him
several
hundred
years
before
moses
was
born
and
that
it
was
told
of
various
other
important
personages
of
antiquity
the
professor
dealt
just
as
honestly
with
the
inscriptions
which
show
sundry
statements
in
the
book
of
daniel
to
be
unhistorical
candidly
making
admissions
which
but
a
short
time
before
would
have
filled
orthodoxy
with
horror
a
few
years
later
came
another
testimony
even
more
striking
early
in
the
last
decade
of
the
nineteenth
century
it
was
noised
abroad
that
the
rev
professor
sayce
of
oxford
the
most
eminent
assyriologist
and
egyptologist
of
great
britain
was
about
to
publish
a
work
in
which
what
is
known
as
the
higher
criticism
was
to
be
vigorously
and
probably
destructively
dealt
with
in
the
light
afforded
by
recent
research
among
the
monuments
of
assyria
and
egypt
the
book
was
looked
for
with
eager
expectation
by
the
supporters
of
the
traditional
view
of
scripture
but
when
it
appeared
the
exultation
of
the
traditionalists
was
speedily
changed
to
dismay
for
sayce
while
showing
some
severity
toward
sundry
minor
assumptions
and
assertions
of
biblical
critics
confirmed
all
their
more
important
conclusions
which
properly
fell
within
his
province
while
his
readers
soon
realized
that
these
assumptions
and
assertions
of
overzealous
critics
no
more
disproved
the
main
results
of
biblical
criticism
than
the
wild
guesses
of
kepler
disproved
the
theory
of
copernicus
or
the
discoveries
of
galileo
or
even
the
great
laws
which
bear
kepler
own
name
they
found
new
mines
sprung
under
some
of
the
most
lofty
fortresses
of
the
old
dogmatic
theology
a
few
of
the
statements
of
this
champion
of
orthodoxy
may
be
noted
he
allowed
that
the
week
of
seven
days
and
the
sabbath
rest
are
of
babylonian
origin
indeed
that
the
very
word
sabbath
is
babylonian
that
there
are
two
narratives
of
creation
on
the
babylonian
tablets
wonderfully
like
the
two
leading
hebrew
narratives
in
genesis
and
that
the
latter
were
undoubtedly
drawn
from
the
former
that
the
garden
of
eden
and
its
mystical
tree
were
known
to
the
inhabitants
of
chaldea
in
days
that
the
beliefs
that
woman
was
created
out
of
man
and
that
man
by
sin
fell
from
a
state
of
innocence
are
drawn
from
very
ancient
texts
that
assyriology
confirms
the
belief
that
the
book
genesis
is
a
compilation
that
portions
of
it
are
by
no
means
so
old
as
the
time
of
moses
that
the
expression
in
our
sacred
book
the
lord
smelled
a
sweet
savour
at
the
sacrifice
made
by
noah
is
identical
with
that
of
the
babylonian
poet
that
it
is
impossible
to
believe
that
the
language
of
the
latter
was
not
known
to
the
biblical
writer
and
that
the
story
of
joseph
and
potiphar
wife
was
drawn
in
part
from
the
old
egyptian
tale
of
the
two
brothers
finally
after
a
multitude
of
other
concessions
sayce
allowed
that
the
book
of
jonah
so
far
from
being
the
work
of
the
prophet
himself
can
not
have
been
written
until
the
assyrian
empire
was
a
thing
of
the
past
that
the
book
of
daniel
contains
serious
mistakes
that
the
historical
chapters
of
that
book
so
conflict
with
the
monuments
that
the
author
can
not
have
been
a
contemporary
of
nebuchadnezzar
and
cyrus
that
the
story
of
belshazzar
fall
is
not
historical
that
the
belshazzar
referred
to
in
it
as
king
and
as
the
son
of
nehuchadnezzar
was
not
the
son
of
nebuchadnezzar
and
was
never
king
that
king
darius
the
mede
who
plays
so
great
a
part
in
the
story
never
existed
that
the
book
associates
persons
and
events
really
many
years
apart
and
that
it
must
have
been
written
at
a
period
far
later
than
the
time
assigned
in
it
for
its
own
origin
as
to
the
book
of
ezra
he
tells
us
that
we
are
confronted
by
a
chronological
inconsistency
which
no
amount
of
ingenuity
can
explain
away
he
also
acknowledges
that
the
book
of
esther
contains
many
exaggerations
and
improbabilities
and
is
simply
founded
upon
one
of
those
same
historical
tales
of
which
the
persian
chronicles
seem
to
have
been
full
great
was
the
dissatisfaction
of
the
traditionalists
with
their
expected
champion
well
might
they
repeat

all
the
more
valuable
they

at

revealed
the
limitations
of
the

they
have

to

facts
utterly
disproving
the
sacred
hebrew
date
of

the
main
framework

suggestive
correspondence

these

have
also
found
that
the
legends
of
the
plagues
of
egypt
are
in
the
main
but
natural
exaggerations
of
what
occurs
every
year
as
for
example
the
changing
of
the
water
of
the
nile
into
blood
evidently
suggested
by
the
phenomena
exhibited
every
summer
when
as
various
eminent

most
recent

tell

these

have
also
shown
that
some
of
the
most
important
features
in
the
legends
can
not
possibly
be
reconciled
with
the
records
of
the
monuments
for
example
that
the
pharaoh
of
the
exodus
was
certainly
not
overwhelmed
in
the
red
sea
as
to
the
supernatural
features
of
the
hebrew
relations
with
egypt
even
the
most
devoted
apologists
have
become
discreetly
silent
egyptologists
have
also
translated
for
us
the
old
nile
story
of
the
two
brothers

have
shown
as
we
have
already
seen
that
one
of
the
most
striking
parts
of
our
sacred
joseph
legend
was
drawn
from
it
they
have
been
obliged
to
admit
that
the
story
of
the
exposure
of
moses
in
the
basket
of
rushes
his
rescue
and
his
subsequent
greatness
had
been
previously
told
long
before
moses
time
not
only
of
king
sargon
but
of
various
other
great
personages
of
the
ancient
world
they
have
published
plans
of

temples

the

origin
of
some
of
the
most
striking
features
of
the
worship

ceremonial
claimed
to
have
been
revealed
especially
to
the
hebrews
they
have
found
in

egyptian

the
dead

in

have
been

only
to

of
the
covenant
in

ten
commandments
and
elsewhere
they
have
given
to
the
world

of
the

texts

that
the
theology
of
the

was

while

sort
the
centre

being
the
university
of
oxford
by
their
efforts
was
presented
to
the
world
a
series
of
translations
of
the
sacred
books
of
the
east
which
showed
the
relations
of
the
more
eastern
sacred
literature
to
our
own
and
proved
that
in
the
religions
of
the
world
the
ideas
which
have
come
as
the
greatest
blessings
to
mankind
are
not
of
sudden
revelation
or
creation
but
of
slow
evolution
out
of
a
remote
past
the
facts
thus
shown
did
not
at
first
elicit
much
gratitude
from
supporters
of
traditional
theology
and
perhaps
few
things
brought
more
obloquy
on
renan
for
a
time
than
his
statement
that
the
influence
of
persia
is
the
most
powerful
to
which
israel
was
submitted
whether
this
was
an
overstatement
or
not
it
was
soon
seen
to
contain
much
truth
not
only
was
it
made
clear
by
study
of
the
zend
avesta
that
the
old
and
new
testament
ideas
regarding
satanic
and
demoniacal
modes
of
action
were
largely
due
to
persian
sources
but
it
was
also
shown
that
the
idea
of
immortality
was
mainly
developed
in
the
hebrew
mind
during
the
close
relations
of
the
jews
with
the
persians
nor
was
this
all
in
the
zend
avesta
were
found
in
earlier
form
sundry
myths
and
legends
which
judging
from
their
frequent
appearance
in
early
religions
grow
naturally
about
the
history
of
the
adored
teachers
of
our
race
typical
among
these
was
the
temptation
of
zoroaster
it
is
a
fact
very
significant
and
full
of
promise
that
the
first
large
frank
and
explicit
revelation
regarding
this
whole
subject
in
form
available
for
the
general
thinking
public
was
given
to
the
world
by
an
eminent
christian
divine
and
scholar
the
rev
mills
having
already
shown
himself
by
his
translations
a
most
competent
authority
on
the
subject
he
in
called
attention
in
a
review
widely
read
to
the
now
undoubted
and
long
since
suspected
fact
that
it
pleased
the
divine
power
to
reveal
some
of
the
important
articles
of
our
catholic
creed
first
to
the
zoroastrians
and
through
their
literature
to
the
jews
and
ourselves
among
these
beliefs
mills
traced
out
very
conclusively
many
jewish
doctrines
regarding
the
attributes
of
god
and
all
virtually
regarding
the
attributes
of
satan
there
too
he
found
accounts
of
the
miraculous
conception
virgin
birth
and
temptation
of
zoroaster
as
to
the
last
mills
presented
a
series
of
striking
coincidences
with
our
own
later
account
as
to
its
main
features
he
showed
that
there
had
been
developed
among
the
persians
many
centuries
before
the
christian
era
the
legend
of
a
vain
effort
of
the
one
seat
of
whose
power
was
the
summit
of
mount
arezura
to
tempt
zoroaster
to
worship
him
of
an
argument
between
tempter
and
tempted
and
of
zoroaster
refusal
and
the
doctor
continued
no
persian
subject
in
the
streets
of
jerusalem
soon
after
or
long
after
the
return
could
have
failed
to
know
this
striking
myth
mills
then
went
on
to
show
that
among
the
jews
the
doctrine
of
immortality
was
scarcely
mooted
before
the
later
isaiah
that
is
before
the
captivity
while
the
zoroastrian
scriptures
are
one
mass
of
spiritualism
referring
all
results
to
the
heavenly
or
to
the
infernal
worlds
he
concludes
by
saying
that
as
regards
the
old
and
new
testaments
the
humble
and
to
a
certain
extent
prior
religion
of
the
mazda
worshippers
was
useful
in
giving
point
and
beauty
to
many
loose
conceptions
among
the
jewish
religious
teachers
and
in

the
resemblances

in

with
those
of

were
especially
suggestive
here
too
had
been
a
long

history
the
discoveries

made
in
the

half
of

and
the
first
half
of

by

carey

met
at

with

and
its

became
the
sources
from
which
many
ideas
and
narratives
in

had
been
developed
studies
in
the
sacred

and
in
the
institutions
of

the
most
widespread
of
all
religions
its
devotees
outnumbering
those
of
all
branches
of
the
christian
church
together
proved
especially
fruitful
in
facts
relating
to
general
sacred
literature
and
early
european
religious
ideas
noteworthy
in
the
progress
of
this
knowledge
was
the
work
of
fathers
huc
and
gabet
in
the
former
of
these
a
french
lazarist
priest
set
out
on
a
mission
to
china
having
prepared
himself
at
macao
by
eighteen
months
of
hard
study
and
having
arrayed
himself
like
a
native
even
to
the
wearing
of
the
queue
and
the
staining
of
his
skin
he
visited
peking
and
penetrated
mongolia
five
years
later
taking
gabet
with
him
both
disguised
as
lamas
he
began
his
long
and
toilsome
journey
to
the
chief
seats
of
buddhism
in
thibet
and
after
two
years
of
fearful
dangers
and
sufferings
accomplished
it
driven
out
finally
by
the
chinese
huc
returned
to
europe
in
having
made
one
of
the
most
heroic
and
as
it
turned
out
one
of
the
most
valuable
efforts
in
all
the
noble
annals
of
christian
missions
his
accounts
of
these
journevs
written
in
a
style
simple
clear
and
interesting
at
once
attracted
attention
throughout
the
world
but
far
more
important
than
any
services
he
had
rendered
to
the
church
he
served
was
the
influence
of
his
book
upon
the
general
opinions
of
thinking
men
for
he
completed
a
series
of
revelations
made
by
earlier
less
gifted
and
less
devoted
travellers
and
brought
to
the
notice
of
the
world
the
amazing
similarity
of
the
ideas
institutions
observances
ceremonies
and
ritual
and
even
the
ecclesiastical
costumes
of
the
buddhists
to
those
of
his
own
church
buddhism
was
thus
shown
with
its
hierarchy
in
which
the
grand
lama
an
infallible
representative
of
the
most
high
is
surrounded
by
its
minor
lamas
much
like
cardinals
with
its
bishops
wearing
mitres
its
celibate
priests
with
shaven
crown
cope
dalmatic
and
censer
its
cathedrals
with
clergy
gathered
in
the
choir
its
vast
monasteries
filled
with
monks
and
nuns
vowed
to
poverty
chastity
and
obedience
its
church
arrangements
with
shrines
of
saints
and
angels
its
use
of
images
pictures
and
illuminated
missals
its
service
with
a
striking
general
resemblance
to
the
mass
antiphonal
choirs
intoning
of
prayers
recital
of
creeds
repetition
of
litanies
processions
mystic
rites
and
incense
the
offering
and
adoration
of
bread
upon
an
altar
lighted
by
candles
the
drinking
from
a
chalice
by
the
priest
prayers
and
offerings
for
the
dead
benediction
with
outstretched
hands
fasts
confessions
and
doctrine
of
purgatory
all
this
and
more
was
now
clearly
revealed
the
good
father
was
evidently
staggered
by
these
amazing
facts
but
his
robust
faith
soon
gave
him
an
explanation
he
suggested
that
satan
in
anticipation
of
christianity
had
revealed
to
buddhism
this
divinely
constituted
order
of
things
this
naive
explanation
did
not
commend
itself
to
his
superiors
in
the
roman
church
in
the
days
of
augustine
or
of
thomas
aquinas
it
would
doubtless
have
been
received
much
more
kindly
but
in
the
days
of
cardinal
antonelli
this
was
hardly
to
be
expected
the
roman
authorities
seeing
the
danger
of
such
plain
revelations
in
the
nineteenth
century
even
when
coupled
with
such
devout
explanations
put
the
book
under
the
ban
though
not
before
it
had
been
spread
throughout
the
world
in
various
translations
father
huc
was
sent
on
no
more
missions
yet
there
came
even
more
significant
discoveries
especially
bearing
upon
the
claims
of
that
great
branch
of
the
church
which
supposes
itself
to
possess
a
divine
safeguard
against
error
in
belief
for
now
was
brought
to
light
by
literary
research
the
irrefragable
evidence
that
the
great
buddha
sakya
muni
himself
had
been
canonized
and
enrolled
among
the
christian
saints
whose
intercession
may
be
invoked
and
in
whose
honour
images
altars
and
chapels
may
be
erected
and
this
not
only
by
the
usage
of
the
medieval
church
greek
and
roman
but
by
the
special
and
infallible
sanction
of
a
long
series
of
popes
from
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
to
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
a
sanction
granted
under
one
of
the
most
curious
errors
in
human
history
the
story
enables
us
to
understand
the
way
in
which
many
of
the
beliefs
of
christendom
have
been
developed
especially
how
they
have
been
influenced
from
the
seats
of
older
religions
and
it
throws
much
light
into
the
character
and
exercise
of
papal
infallibility
early
in
the
seventh
century
there
was
composed
as
is
now
believed
at
the
convent
of
saba
near
jerusalem
a
pious
romance
entitled
barlaam
and
josaphat
the
latter
personage
the
hero
of
the
story
being
represented
as
a
hindu
prince
converted
to
christianity
by
the
former
this
story
having
been
attributed
to
john
of
damascus
in
the
following
century
became
amazingly
popular
and
was
soon
accepted
as
true
it
was
translated
from
the
greek
original
not
only
into
latin
hebrew
arabic
and
ethiopic
but
into
every
important
european
language
including
even
polish
bohemian
and
icelandic
thence
it
came
into
the
pious
historical
encyclopaedia
of
vincent
of
beauvais
and
most
important
of
all
into
the
lives
of
the
saints
hence
the
name
of
its
pious
hero
found
its
way
into
the
list
of
saints
whose
intercession
is
to
be
prayed
for
and
it
passed
without
challenge
until
about
when
the
general
subject
of
canonization
having
been
brought
up
at
rome
pope
sixtus
v
by
virtue
of
his
infallibility
and
immunity
against
error
in
everything
relating
to
faith
and
morals
sanctioned
a
revised
list
of
saints
authorizing
and
directing
it
to
be
accepted
by
the
church
and
among
those
on
whom
he
thus
forever
infallibly
set
the
seal
of
heaven
was
included
the
holy
saint
josaphat
of
india
whose
wonderful
acts
john
of
damascus
has
related
the
of
november
was
appointed
as
the
day
set
apart
in
honour
of
this
saint
and
the
decree
having
been
enforced
by
successive
popes
for
over
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
was
again
officially
approved
by
pius
ix
in
this
decree
was
duly
accepted
as
infallible
and
in
one
of
the
largest
cities
of
italy
may
be
seen
a
christian
church
dedicated
to
this
saint
on
its
front
are
the
initials
of
his
italianized
name
over
its
main
entrance
is
the
inscription
divo
josafat
and
within
it
is
an
altar
dedicated
to
the
saint
above
this
being
a
pedestal
bearing
his
name
and
supporting
a
large
statue
which
represents
him
as
a
youthful
prince
wearing
a
crown
and
contemplating
a
crucifix
moreover
relics
of
this
saint
were
found
bones
alleged
to
be
parts
of
his
skeleton
having
been
presented
by
a
doge
of
venice
to
a
king
of
portugal
are
now
treasured
at
antwerp
but
even
as
early
as
the
sixteenth
century
a
pregnant
fact
regarding
this
whole
legend
was
noted
for
the
portuguese
historian
diego
conto
showed
that
it
was
identical
with
the
legend
of
buddha
fortunately
for
the
historian
his
faith
was
so
robust
that
he
saw
in
this
resemblance
only
a
trick
of
satan
the
life
of
buddha
being
in
his
opinion
merely
a
diabolic
counterfeit
of
the
life
of
josaphat
centuries
before
the
latter
was
lived
or
written
just
as
good
abbe
huc
saw
in
the
ceremonies
of
buddhism
a
similar
anticipatory
counterfeit
of
christian
ritual
there
the
whole
matter
virtually
rested
for
about
three
hundred
years
various
scholars
calling
attention
to
the
legend
as
a
curiosity
but
none
really
showing
its
true
bearings
until
in
laboulaye
in
france
liebrecht
in
germany
and
others
following
them
demonstrated
that
this
christian
work
was
drawn
almost
literally
from
an
early
biography
of
buddha
being
conformed
to
it
in
the
most
minute
details
not
only
of
events
but
of
phraseology
the
only
important
changes
being
that
at
the
end
of
the
various
experiences
showing
the
wretchedness
of
the
world
identical
with
those
ascribed
in
the
original
to
the
young
prince
buddha
the
hero
instead
of
becoming
a
hermit
becomes
a
christian
and
that
for
the
appellation
of
buddha
bodisat
is
substituted
the
more
scriptural
name
josaphat
thus
it
was
that
by
virtue
of
the
infallibility
vouchsafed
to
the
papacy
in
matters
of
faith
and
morals
buddha
became
a
christian
saint
yet
these
were
by
no
means
the
most
pregnant
revelations
as
the
buddhist
scriptures
were
more
fully
examined
there
were
disclosed
interesting
anticipations
of
statements
in
later
sacred
books
the
miraculous
conception
of
buddha
and
his
virgin
birth
like
that
of
horus
in
egypt
and
of
krishna
in
india
the
previous
annunciation
to
his
mother
maja
his
birth
during
a
journey
by
her
the
star
appearing
in
the
east
and
the
angels
chanting
in
the
heavens
at
his
birth
his
temptation
all
these
and
a
multitude
of
other
statements
were
full
of
suggestions
to
larger
thought
regarding
the
development
of
sacred
literature
in
general
even
the
eminent
roman
catholic
missionary
bishop
bigandet
was
obliged
to
confess
in
his
scholarly
life
of
buddha
these
striking
similarities
between
the
buddhist
scriptures
and
those
which
it
was
his
mission
to
expound
though
by
this
honest
statement
his
own
further
promotion
was
rendered
impossible
fausboll
also
found
the
story
of
the
judgment
of
solomon
imbedded
in
buddhist
folklore
and
sir
edwin
arnold
by
his
poem
the
light
of
asia
spread
far
and
wide
a
knowledge
of
the
anticipation
in
buddhism
of
some
ideas
which
down
to
a
recent
period
were
considered
distinctively
christian
imperfect
as
the
revelations
thus
made
of
an
evolution
of
religious
beliefs
institutions
and
literature
still
are
they
have
not
been
without
an
important
bearing
upon
the
newer
conception
of
our
own
sacred
books
more
and
more
manifest
has
become
the
interdependence
of
all
human
development
more
and
more
clear
the
truth
that
christianity
as
a
great
fact
in
man
history
is
not

of
the
innumerable
murderous
affrays
of
the
seventeenth
century
between
different
sorts
of
fanatics
greek
catholic
and
protestant
in
poland
he
also
was
finally
canonized

to
go
into
the
subject
in
detail
would
be
beyond
the
scope
of
this
work
but
a
few
of
the
main
truths
which
it
brought
before
the
world
may
be
here
summarized
for
a
brief
but
thorough
statement
of
the
work
of
strauss
baur
and
the
earlier
cruder
efforts
in
new
testament
exegesis

and
for
the
later
work
on

religion
and

answer
book
iv
chap
ii
by
the
new
race
of
christian
scholars
it
has
been
clearly
shown
that
the
first
three
gospels
which
down
to
the
close
of
the
last
century
were
so
constantly
declared
to
be
three
independent
testimonies
agreeing
as
to
the
events
recorded
are
neither
independent
of
each
other
nor
in
that
sort
of
agreement
which
was
formerly
asserted
all
biblical
scholars
of
any
standing
even
the
most
conservative
have
come
to
admit
that
all
three
took
their
rise
in
the
same
original
sources
growing
by
the
accretions
sure
to
come
as
time
went
on
accretions
sometimes
useful
and
often
beautiful
but
in
no
inconsiderable
degree
ideas
and
even
narratives
inherited
from
older
religions
it
is
also
fully
acknowledged
that
to
this
growth
process
are
due
certain
contradictions
which
can
not
otherwise
be
explained
as
to
the
fourth
gospel
exquisitely
beautiful
as
large
portions
of
it
are
there
has
been
growing
steadily
and
irresistibly
the
conviction
even
among
the
most
devout
scholars
that
it
has
no
right
to
the
name
and
does
not
really
give
the
ideas
of
john
but
that
it
represents
a
mixture
of
greek
philosophy
with
jewish
theology
and
that
its
final
form
which
one
of
the
most
eminent
among
recent
christian
scholars
has
characterized
as
an
unhistorical
product
of
abstract
reflection
is
mainly
due
to
some
gifted
representative
or
representatives
of
the
alexandrian
school
bitter
as
the
resistance
to
this
view
has
been
it
has
during
the
last
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
won
its
way
more
and
more
to
acknowledgment
a
careful
examination
made
in
by
a
competent
christian
scholar
showed
facts
which
are
best
given
in
his
own
words
as
follows
in
the
period
of
thirty
years
ending
in
of
the
fifty
great
authorities
in
this
line
four
to
one
were
in
favour
of
the
johannine
authorship
of
those
who
in
that
period
had
advocated
this
traditional
position
one
quarter
and
certainly
the
very
greatest
finally
changed
their
position
to
the
side
of
a
late
date
and
authorship
of
those
who
have
come
into
this
field
of
scholarship
since
about
some
forty
men
of
the
first
class
two
thirds
reject
the
traditional
theory
wholly
or
very
largely
of
those
who
have
contributed
important
articles
to
the
discussion
from
about
to
about
two
to
one
reject
the
johannine
authorship
of
the
gospel
in
its
present
shape
that
is
to
say
while
forty
years
ago
great
scholars
were
four
to
one
in
favour
of
they
are
now
two
to
one
against
the
claim
that
the
apostle
john
wrote
this
gospel
as
we
have
it
again
one
half
of
those
on
the
conservative
side
scholars
like
weiss
beyschlag
sanday
and
reynolds
admit
the
existence
of
a
dogmatic
intent
and
an
ideal
element
in
this
gospel
so
that
we
do
not
have
jesus
thought
in
his
exact
words
but
only
in
substance

the
citations
given
regarding
the
development
of
thought

among

and

whole
series
of
subjects
of
which
this
forms
a
part
may
most
profitably
study
the
rev
cone
gospel
criticism
and
historic
christianity
one
of
the
most
lucid
and
judicial
of
recent
works
in
this
field
in
came
an
event
of
great
importance
as
regards
the
development
of
a
more
frank
and
open
dealing
with
scriptural
criticism
in
that
year
appeared
the
revised
version
of
the
new
testament
it
was
exceedingly
cautious
and
conservative
but
it
had
the
vast
merit
of
being
absolutely
conscientious
one
thing
showed
in
a
striking
way
ethical
progress
in
theological
methods
although
all
but
one
of
the
english
revisers
represented
trinitarian
bodies
they
rejected
the
two
great
proof
texts
which
had
so
long
been
accounted
essential
bulwarks
of
trinitarian
doctrine
thus
disappeared
at
last
from
the
epistle
of
john
the
text
of
the
three
witnesses
which
had
for
centuries
held
its
place
in
spite
of
its
absence
from
all
the
earlier
important
manuscripts
and
of
its
rejection
in
later
times
by
erasmus
luther
isaac
newton
porson
and
a
long
line
of
the
greatest
biblical
scholars
and
with
this
was
thrown
out
the
other
like
unto
it
in
spurious
origin
and
zealous
intent
that
interpolation
of
the
word
god
in
the
sixteenth
verse
of
the
third
chapter
of
the
first
epistle
to
timothy
which
had
for
ages
served
as
a
warrant
for
condemning
some
of
the
noblest
of
christians
even
such
men
as
newton
and
milton
and
locke
and
priestley
and
channing
indeed
so
honest
were
the
revisers
that
they
substituted
the
correct
reading
of
luke
ii
in
place
of
the
corruption
in
the
king
james
version
which
had
been
thought
necessary
to
safeguard
the
dogma
of
the
virgin
birth
of
jesus
of
nazareth
thus
came
the
true
reading
his
father
and
his
mother
instead
of
the
old
piously
fraudulent
words
joseph
and
his
mother
an
even
more
important
service
to
the
new
and
better
growth
of
christianity
was
the
virtual
setting
aside
of
the
last
twelve
verses
of
the
gospel
according
to
mark
for
among
these
stood
that
sentence
which
has
cost
the
world
more
innocent
blood
than
any
other
the
words
he
that
believeth
not
shall
be
damned
from
this
source
had
logically
grown
the
idea
that
the
intellectual
rejection
of
this
or
that
dogma
which
dominant
theology
had
happened
at
any
given
time
to
pronounce
essential
since
such
rejection
must
bring
punishment
infinite
in
agony
and
duration
is
a
crime
to
be
prevented
at
any
cost
of
finite
cruelty
still
another
service
rendered
to
humanity
by
the
revisers
was
in
substituting
a
new
and
correct
rendering
for
the
old
reading
of
the
famous
text
regarding
the
inspiration
of
scripture
which
had
for
ages
done
so
much
to
make
our
sacred
books
a
fetich
by
this
more
correct
reading
the
revisers
gave
a
new
charter
to
liberty
in
biblical
research
the
texts
referred
to
as
most
beneficially
changed
by
the
revisers
are
i
john
v
and
i
timothy
iii
mention
may
also
be
made
of
the
fact
that
the
american
revision
gave
up
the
trinitarian
version
of
romans
ix
and
that
even
their
more
conservative
british
brethren
while
leaving
it
in
the
text
discredited
it
in
the
margin
though
revisers
thought
it
better
not
to
suppress
altogether
the
last
twelve
verses
of
mark
gospel
they
softened
the
word
damned
to
condemned
and
separated
them
from
the
main
gospel
adding
a
note
stating
that
the
two
oldest
greek
manuscripts
and
some
other
authorities
omit
from
verse
nine
to
the
end
and
that
some
other
authorities
have
a
different
ending
to
this
gospel
the
resistance
of
staunch
high
churchmen
of
the
older
type
even
to
so
mild
a
reform
as
the
first
change
above
noted
may
be
exemplified
by
a
story
told
of
philpotts
bishop
of
exeter
about
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
a
kindly
clergyman
reading
an
invitation
to
the
holy
communion
and
thinking
that
so
an
affectionate
a
call
was
disfigured
by
the
harsh
phrase
eateth
and
drinketh
to
his
own
damnation
ventured
timidly
to
substitute
the
word
condemnation
thereupon
the
bishop
who
was
kneeling
with
the
rest
of
the
congregation
threw
up
his
head
and
roared
damnation
the
story
is
given
in
trollope
what
i
remember
vol
i
american
churchmen
may
well
rejoice
that
the
fathers
of
the
american
branch
of
the
anglican
church
were
wise
enough
and
christian
enough
to
omit
from
their
prayer
book
this
damnatory
clause
as
well
as
the
commination
service
and
the
athanasian
creed
most
valuable
too
have
been
studies
during
the
latter
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
upon
the
formation
of
the
canon
of
scripture
the
result
of
these
has
been
to
substitute
something
far
better
for
that
conception
of
our
biblical
literature
as
forming
one
book
handed
out
of
the
clouds
by
the
almighty
which
had
been
so
long
practically
the
accepted
view
among
probably
the
majority
of
christians
reverent
scholars
have
demonstrated
our
sacred
literature
to
be
a
growth
in
obedience
to
simple
laws
natural
and
historical
they
have
shown
how
some
books
of
the
old
testament
were
accepted
as
sacred
centuries
before
our
era
and
how
others
gradually
gained
sanctity
in
some
cases
only
fully
acquiring
it
long
after
the
establishment
of
the
christian
church
the
same
slow
growth
has
also
been
shown
in
the
new
testament
canon
it
has
been
demonstrated
that
the
selection
of
the
books
composing
it
and
their
separation
from
the
vast
mass
of
spurious
gospels
epistles
and
apocalyptic
literature
was
a
gradual
process
and
indeed
that
the
rejection
of
some
books
and
the
acceptance
of
others
was
accidental
if
anything
is
accidental
so
too
scientific
biblical
research
has
as
we
have
seen
been
obliged
to
admit
the
existence
of
much
mythical
and
legendary
matter
as
a
setting
for
the
great
truths
not
only
of
the
old
testament
but
of
the
new
it
has
also
shown
by
the
comparative
study
of
literatures
the
process
by
which
some
books
were
compiled
and
recompiled
adorned
with
beautiful
utterances
strengthened
or
weakened
by
alterations
and
interpolations
expressing
the
views
of
the
possessors
or
transcribers
and
attributed
to
personages
who
could
not
possibly
have
written
them
the
presentation
of
these
things
has
greatly
weakened
that
sway
of
mere
dogma
which
has
so
obscured
the
simple
teachings
of
christ
himself
for
it
has
shown
that
the
more
we
know
of
our
sacred
books
the
less
certain
we
become
as
to
the
authenticity
of
proof
texts
and
it
has
disengaged
more
and
more
as
the
only
valuable
residuum
like
the
mass
of
gold
at
the
bottom
of
the
crucible
the
personality
spirit
teaching
and
ideals
of
the
blessed
founder
of
christianity
more
and
more
too
the
new
scholarship
has
developed
the
conception
of
the
new
testament
as
like
the
old
the
growth
of
literature
in
obedience
to
law
a
conception
which
in
al
probability
will
give
it
its
strongest
hold
on
the
coming
centuries
in
making
this
revelation
christian
scholarship
has
by
no
means
done
work
mainly
destructive
it
has
indeed
swept
away
a
mass
of
noxious
growths
but
it
has
at
the
same
time
cleared
the
ground
for
a
better
growth
of
christianity
a
growth
through
which
already
pulsates
the
current
of
a
nobler
life
it
has
forever
destroyed
the
contention
of
scholars
like
those
of
the
eighteenth
century
who
saw
in
the
multitude
of
irreconcilable
discrepancies
between
various
biblical
statements
merely
evidences
of
priestcraft
and
intentional
fraud
the
new
scholarship
has
shown
that
even
such
absolute
contradictions
as
those
between
the
accounts
of
the
early
life
of
jesus
by
matthew
and
luke
and
between
the
date
of
the
crucifixion
and
details
of
the
resurrection
in
the
first
three
gospels
and
in
the
fourth
and
other
discrepancies
hardly
less
serious
do
not
destroy
the
historical
character
of
the
narrative
even
the
hopelessly
conflicting
genealogies
of
the
saviour
and
the
evidently
mythical
accretions
about
the
simple
facts
of
his
birth
and
life
are
thus
full
of
interest
when
taken
as
a
natural
literary
development
in
obedience
to
the
deepest
religious
feeling
among
the
newer
english
works
of
the
canon
of
scripture

the

lucid

work
of

to
bear
upon
the
development
of
a
broader
and
deeper
view
in
the
light
of
his
genius
a
conception
of
our
sacred
books
at
the
same
time
more
literary
as
well
as
more
scientific
has
grown
widely
and
vigorously
while
the
older
view
which
made
of
them
a
fetich
and
a
support
for
unchristian
dogmas
has
been
more
and
more
thrown
into
the
background
the
contributions
to
these
results
by
the
most
eminent
professors
at
the
great
christian
universities
of
the
world
oxford
and
cambridge
taking
the
lead
are
most
hopeful
signs
of
a
new
epoch
very
significant
also
is
a
change
in
the
style
of
argument
against
the
scientific
view
leading
supporters
of
the
older
opinions
see
more
and
more
clearly
the
worthlessness
of
rhetoric
against
ascertained
fact
mere
dogged
resistance
to
cogent
argument
evidently
avails
less
and
less
and
the
readiness
of
the
more
prominent
representatives
of
the
older
thought
to
consider
opposing
arguments
and
to
acknowledge
any
force
they
may
have
is
certainly
of
good
omen
the
concessions
made
in
lux
mundi
regarding
scriptural
myths
and
legends
have
been
already
mentioned
significant
also
has
been
the
increasing
reprobation
in
the
church
itself
of
the
profound
though
doubtless
unwitting
immoralities
of
reconcilers
the
castigation
which
followed
the
exploits
of
the
greatest
of
these
in

own
time
gladstone
at
the
hands
of

did
much
to
complete
a
work
in
which
such
eminent
churchmen
as
stanley
farrar
sanday
cheyne
driver
and
sayce
had
rendered
good
service
typical
among
these
evidences
of
a
better
spirit
in
controversy
has
been
the
treatment
of
the
question
regarding
mistaken
quotations
from
the
old
testament
in
the
new
and
especially
regarding
quotations
by
christ
himself
for
a
time
this
was
apparently
the
most
difficult
of
all
matters
dividing
the
two
forces
but
though
here
and
there
appear
champions
of
tradition
like
the
bishop
of
gloucester
effectual
resistance
to
the
new
view
has
virtually
ceased
in
one
way
or
another
the
most
conservative
authorities
have
accepted
the
undoubted
truth
revealed
by
a
simple
scientific
method
their
arguments
have
indeed
been
varied
while
some
have
fallen
back
upon

contention
that
christ
did
not

to
teach

to

a

happy
departure

pass
without

of

truly
pathetic
is
it
to
see
this
venerable
and
learned
prelate
one
of
the
most
eminent
representatives
of
the
older
biblical
research
even
when
giving
solemn
warnings
against
the
newer
criticisms
and
under
all
the
temptations
of
ex
cathedra
utterance
remaining
mild
and
gentle
and
just
in
the
treatment
of
adversaries
whose
ideas
he
evidently
abhors
happily
he
is
comforted
by
the
faith
that
christianity
will
survive
and
this
faith
his
opponents
fully
share
as
an
example
of
courtesy
between

be
cited
the

principal

testimonies
one

was
mentioned
to

honoured
diplomatist

scholar
at

while
this
gentleman
was
looking
over
the

of

cardinal
recently
deceased
he
noticed
a

of
octavos
bearing
on
their
backs
the
title
acta
apostolorum
surprised
at
such
an
extension
of
the
acts
of

he
opened
a
volume
and
found
the

to
be
the

reconstructive

for
all
this
dissolving

more
general
and
powerful
than
any
which

been

for
it
is
a
cause
surrounding
and
permeating
all
this
is
simply
the
atmosphere
of
thought
engendered
by
the
development
of
all
sciences
during
the
last
three
centuries
vast
masses
of
myth
legend
marvel
and
dogmatic
assertion
coming
into
this
atmosphere
have
been
dissolved
and
are
now
dissolving
quietly
away
like
icebergs
drifted
into
the
gulf
stream
in
earlier
days
when
some
critic
in
advance
of
his
time
insisted
that
moses
could
not
have
written
an
account
embracing
the
circumstances
of
his
own
death
it
was
sufficient
to
answer
that
moses
was
a
prophet
if
attention
was
called
to
the
fact
that
the
great
early
prophets
by
all
which
they
did
and
did
not
do
showed
that
there
could
not
have
existed
in
their
time
any
levitical
code
a
sufficient
answer
was
mystery
and
if
the
discrepancy
was
noted
between
the
two
accounts
of
creation
in
genesis
or
between
the
genealogies
or
the
dates
of
the
crucifixion
in
the
gospels
the
cogent
reply
was
infidelity
but
the
thinking
world
has
at
last
been
borne
by
the
general
development
of
a
scientific
atmosphere
beyond
that
kind
of
refutation
if
in
the
atmosphere
generated
by
the
earlier
developed
sciences
the
older
growths
of
biblical
interpretation
have
drooped
and
withered
and
are
evidently
perishing
new
and
better
growths
have
arisen
with
roots
running
down
into
the
newer
sciences
comparative
anthropology
in
general
by
showing
that
various
early
stages
of
belief
and
observance
once
supposed
to
be
derived
from
direct
revelation
from
heaven
to
the
hebrews
are
still
found
as
arrested
developments
among
various
savage
and
barbarous
tribes
comparative
mythology
and
folklore
by
showing
that
ideas
and
beliefs
regarding
the
supreme
power
in
the
universe
are
progressive
and
not
less
in
judea
than
in
other
parts
of
the
world
comparative
religion
and
literature
by
searching
out
and
laying
side
by
side
those
main
facts
in
the
upward
struggle
of
humanity
which
show
that
the
israelites
like
other
gifted
peoples
rose
gradually
through
ghost
worship
fetichism
and
polytheism
to
higher
theological
levels
and
that
as
they
thus
rose
their
conceptions
and
statements
regarding
the
god
they
worshipped
became
nobler
and
better
all
these
sciences
are
giving
a
new
solution
to
those
problems
which
dogmatic
theology
has
so
long
laboured
in
vain
to
solve
while
researches
in
these
sciences
have
established
the
fact
that
accounts
formerly
supposed
to
be
special
revelations
to
jews
and
christians
are
but
repetitions
of
widespread
legends
dating
from
far
earlier
civilizations
and
that
beliefs
formerly
thought
fundamental
to
judaism
and
christianity
are
simply
based
on
ancient
myths
they
have
also
begun
to
impress
upon
the
intellect
and
conscience
of
the
thinking
world
the
fact
that
the
religious
and
moral
truths
thus
disengaged
from
the
old
masses
of
myth
and
legend
are
all
the
more
venerable
and
authoritative
and
that
all
individual
or
national
life
of
any
value
must
be
vitalized
by
them

it

in
obedience
to
this
new
conception

idea

which
mirrors
the
most
striking
evolution
of
morals

religion
in
the
history
of
our
race
of
all
the
sacred
writings
of
the

own
as
the
most
beautiful
and
the
most
precious
exhibiting

us
the
most
complete
religious
development
to
which
humanity
has
attained
and
holding
before
us
the
loftiest
ideals
which
our
race
has
known
thus
it
is
that
with
the
keys
furnished
by
this
new
race
of
biblical
scholars
the
way
has
been
opened
to
treasures
of
thought
which
have
been
inaccessible
to
theologians
for
two
thousand
years
as
to
the
divine
power
in

universe
these
interpreters
have
shown
how
beginning
with
the
tribal
god
of
the
hebrews
one
among
many
jealous
fitful
unseen
local
sovereigns
of

minor
the
higher
races
have
been

to
the
idea
of
the
just
ruler
of
the
whole
earth
as
revealed
by
the
later
and
greater
prophets
of
israel
and
finally
to
the
belief
in
the
universal
father
as
best
revealed
in
the
new
testament
as
to
man
beginning
with
men
after
jehovah

cruel

we
are
borne
on
to
an
ideal
of
men
who
do
right
for
right
sake
who
search
and
speak
the
truth
for
truth
sake
who
love
others
as
themselves
as
to
the
world
at
large
the
races
dominant
in
religion
and
morals
have
been
lifted
from
the
idea
of
a
chosen
people
stimulated
and
abetted
by
their
tribal
god
in
every
sort
of
cruelty
and
injustice
to
the
conception
of
a
vast
community
in
which
the
fatherhood
of
god
overarches
all
and
the
brotherhood
of
man
permeates
all
thus
at
last
out
of
the
old
conception
of
our
bible
as
a
collection
of
oracles
a
mass
of
entangling
utterances
fruitful
in
wrangling
interpretations
which
have
given
to
the
world
long
and
weary
ages
of
hatred
malice
and
all
uncharitableness
of
fetichism
subtlety
and
pomp
of
tyranny
bloodshed
and
solemnly
constituted
imposture
of
everything
which
the
lord
jesus
christ
most
abhorred
has
been
gradually
developed
through
the
centuries
by
the
labours
sacrifices
and
even
the
martyrdom
of
a
long
succession
of
men
of
god
the
conception
of
it
as
a
sacred
literature
a
growth
only
possible
under
that
divine
light
which
the
various
orbs
of
science
have
done
so
much
to
bring
into
the
mind
and
heart
and
soul
of
man
a
revelation
not
of
the
fall
of
man
but
of
the
ascent
of
man
an
exposition
not
of
temporary
dogmas
and
observances
but
of
the
eternal
law
of
righteousness
the
one
upward
path
for
individuals
and
for
nations
no
longer
an
oracle
good
for
the
lower
orders
to
accept
but
to
be
quietly
sneered
at
by
the
enlightened
no
longer
a
fetich
whose
defenders
must
be
persecutors
or
reconcilers
or
apologists
but
a
most
fruitful
fact
which
religion
and
science
may
accept
as
a
source
of
strength
to
both
