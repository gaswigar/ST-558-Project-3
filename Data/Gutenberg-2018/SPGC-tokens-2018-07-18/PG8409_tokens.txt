proofreading
team
between
a
nobleman
and
his
sister
by
aphra
behn
the
argument
in
the
time
of
the
rebellion
of
the
true
protestant
in
under
the
conduct
of
the
prince
of
whom
we
will
call
many
illustrious
persons
were
drawn
into
the
association
amongst
which
there
was
one
whose
quality
and
fortune
joined
with
his
youth
and
beauty
rendered
him
more
elevated
in
the
esteem
of
the
gay
part
of
the
world
than
most
of
that
age
in
his
tender
years
unhappily
enough
he
chanced
to
fall
in
love
with
a
lady
whom
we
will
call
who
had
charms
enough
to
engage
any
heart
she
had
all
the
advantages
of
youth
and
nature
a
shape
excellent
a
most
agreeable
stature
not
too
tall
and
far
from
low
delicately
proportioned
her
face
a
little
inclined
round
soft
smooth
and
white
her
eyes
were
blue
a
little
languishing
and
full
of
love
and
wit
a
mouth
curiously
made
dimpled
and
full
of
sweetness
lips
round
soft
plump
and
red
white
teeth
firm
and
even
her
nose
a
little
and
which
gave
a
noble
grace
to
her
lovely
face
her
hair
light
brown
a
neck
and
bosom
delicately
turned
white
and
rising
her
arms
and
hands
exactly
shaped
to
this
a
vivacity
of
youth
engaging
a
wit
quick
and
flowing
a
humour
gay
and
an
air
irresistibly
charming
and
nothing
was
wanting
to
complete
the
joys
of
the
young
so
we
call
our
amorous
hero
but
heart
which
the
illustrious
had
before
possessed
however
consulting
her
honour
and
her
interest
and
knowing
all
the
arts
as
women
do
to
feign
a
tenderness
she
yields
to
marry
him
while
who
scorned
to
owe
his
happiness
to
the
commands
of
parents
or
to
chaffer
for
a
beauty
with
her
consent
steals
her
away
and
marries
her
but
see
how
transitory
is
a
violent
passion
after
being
satiated
he
slights
the
prize
he
had
so
dearly
conquered
some
say
the
change
was
occasioned
by
her
too
visibly
continued
love
to
but
whatever
it
was
this
was
most
certain
cast
his
eyes
upon
a
young
maid
sister
to
a
beauty
whose
early
bloom
promised
wonders
when
come
to
perfection
but
i
will
spare
her
picture
here
in
the
following
epistles
will
often
enough
present
it
to
your
view
he
loved
and
languished
long
before
he
durst
discover
his
pain
her
being
sister
to
his
wife
nobly
born
and
of
undoubted
fame
rendered
his
passion
too
criminal
to
hope
for
a
return
while
the
young
lovely
so
we
shall
call
the
noble
maid
sighed
out
her
hours
in
the
same
pain
and
languishment
for
and
knew
not
that
it
was
love
till
she
betraying
it
innocently
to
the
overjoyed
lover
and
brother
he
soon
taught
her
to
understand
it
was
love
he
pursues
it
she
permits
it
and
at
last
yields
when
being
discovered
in
the
criminal
intrigue
she
flies
with
him
he
absolutely
quits
lives
some
time
in
a
village
near
called
st
with
this
betrayed
unfortunate
till
being
found
out
and
like
to
be
apprehended
one
for
the
rape
the
other
for
the
flight
she
is
forced
to
marry
a
cadet
a
creature
of
to
bear
the
name
of
husband
only
to
her
while
had
the
entire
possession
of
her
soul
and
body
still
the
went
forward
and
all
things
were
ready
for
a
war
in
but
it
is
not
my
business
here
to
mix
the
rough
relation
of
a
war
with
the
soft
affairs
of
love
let
it
suffice
the
were
defeated
and
the
king
got
the
day
and
every
rebel
lay
at
the
mercy
of
his
sovereign
was
taken
prisoner
made
his
escape
to
a
little
cottage
near
his
own
palace
not
far
from
writes
to
to
come
to
him
which
she
does
and
in
spite
of
all
the
industry
to
him
he
got
away
with
after
their
flight
these
letters
were
found
in
their
cabinets
at
their
house
at
st
where
they
both
lived
together
for
the
space
of
a
year
and
they
are
as
exactly
as
possible
placed
in
the
order
they
were
sent
and
were
those
supposed
to
be
written
towards
the
latter
end
of
their
amours
part
i
sylvia
though
i
parted
from
you
resolved
to
obey
your
impossible
commands
yet
know
oh
charming
that
after
a
thousand
conflicts
between
love
and
honour
i
found
the
god
too
mighty
for
the
idol
reign
absolute
monarch
in
my
soul
and
soon
banished
that
tyrant
thence
that
cruel
counsellor
that
would
suggest
to
you
a
thousand
fond
arguments
to
hinder
my
noble
pursuit
came
in
view
her
irresistible
with
all
the
charms
of
blooming
youth
with
all
the
attractions
of
heavenly
beauty
loose
wanton
gay
all
flowing
her
bright
hair
and
languishing
her
lovely
eyes
her
dress
all
negligent
as
when
i
saw
her
last
discovering
a
thousand
ravishing
graces
round
white
small
breasts
delicate
neck
and
rising
bosom
heaved
with
sighs
she
would
in
vain
conceal
and
all
besides
that
nicest
fancy
can
imagine
surprising
oh
i
dare
not
think
on
lest
my
desires
grow
mad
and
raving
let
it
suffice
oh
adorable
i
think
and
know
enough
to
justify
that
flame
in
me
which
our
weak
alliance
of
brother
and
sister
has
rendered
so
criminal
but
he
that
adores
should
do
it
at
an
uncommon
rate
tis
not
enough
to
sacrifice
a
single
heart
to
give
you
a
simple
passion
your
beauty
should
like
itself
produce
wondrous
effects
it
should
force
all
obligations
all
laws
all
ties
even
of
nature
s
self
you
my
lovely
maid
were
not
born
to
be
obtained
by
the
dull
methods
of
ordinary
loving
and
tis
in
vain
to
prescribe
me
measures
and
oh
much
more
in
vain
to
urge
the
nearness
of
our
relation
what
kin
my
charming
are
you
to
me
no
ties
of
blood
forbid
my
passion
and
what
s
a
ceremony
imposed
on
man
by
custom
what
is
it
to
my
divine
that
the
priest
took
my
hand
and
gave
it
to
your
sister
what
alliance
can
that
create
why
should
a
trick
devised
by
the
wary
old
only
to
make
provision
for
posterity
tie
me
to
an
eternal
slavery
no
no
my
charming
maid
tis
nonsense
all
let
us
born
for
mightier
joys
scorn
the
dull
but
let
us
love
like
the
first
race
of
men
nearest
allied
to
god
promiscuously
they
loved
and
possessed
father
and
daughter
brother
and
sister
met
and
reaped
the
joys
of
love
without
control
and
counted
it
religious
coupling
and
twas
encouraged
too
by
heaven
itself
therefore
start
not
too
nice
and
lovely
maid
at
shadows
of
things
that
can
but
frighten
fools
put
me
not
off
with
these
delays
rather
say
you
but
dissembled
love
all
this
while
than
now
tis
born
to
die
again
with
a
poor
fright
of
nonsense
a
fit
of
honour
a
phantom
imaginary
and
no
more
no
no
represent
me
to
your
soul
more
favourably
think
you
see
me
languishing
at
your
feet
breathing
out
my
last
in
sighs
and
kind
reproaches
on
the
pitiless
reflect
when
i
am
dead
which
will
be
the
more
afflicting
object
the
ghost
as
you
are
pleased
to
call
it
of
your
murdered
honour
or
the
pale
and
bleeding
one
of
philander
have
lived
a
whole
day
and
yet
no
letter
sylvia
philander
oh
why
will
you
make
me
own
oh
too
importunate
with
what
regret
i
made
you
promise
to
prefer
my
honour
before
your
love
i
confess
with
blushes
which
you
might
then
see
kindling
in
my
face
that
i
was
not
at
all
pleased
with
the
vows
you
made
me
to
endeavour
to
obey
me
and
i
then
even
wished
you
would
obstinately
have
denied
obedience
to
my
just
commands
have
pursued
your
criminal
flame
and
have
left
me
raving
on
my
undoing
for
when
you
were
gone
and
i
had
leisure
to
look
into
my
heart
alas
i
found
whether
you
obliged
or
not
whether
love
or
honour
were
preferred
i
unhappy
i
was
either
way
inevitably
lost
oh
what
pitiless
god
fond
of
his
wondrous
power
made
us
the
objects
of
his
almighty
vanity
oh
why
were
we
two
made
the
first
precedents
of
his
new
found
revenge
for
sure
no
brother
ever
loved
a
sister
with
so
criminal
a
flame
before
at
least
my
inexperienced
innocence
never
met
with
so
fatal
a
story
and
it
is
in
vain
my
too
charming
brother
to
make
me
insensible
of
our
alliance
to
persuade
me
i
am
a
stranger
to
all
but
your
eyes
and
soul
alas
your
fatally
kind
industry
is
all
in
vain
you
grew
up
a
brother
with
me
the
title
was
fixed
in
my
heart
when
i
was
too
young
to
understand
your
subtle
distinctions
and
there
it
thrived
and
spread
and
it
is
now
too
late
to
transplant
it
or
alter
its
native
property
who
can
graft
a
flower
on
a
contrary
stalk
the
rose
will
bear
no
tulips
nor
the
hyacinth
the
poppy
no
more
will
the
brother
the
name
of
lover
oh
spoil
not
the
natural
sweetness
and
innocence
we
now
retain
by
an
endeavour
fruitless
and
destructive
no
no
dress
yourself
in
what
charms
you
will
be
powerful
as
love
can
make
you
in
your
soft
argument
yet
oh
yet
you
are
my
brother
but
why
oh
cruel
and
eternal
powers
was
not
my
lover
before
you
destined
him
a
brother
or
why
being
a
brother
did
you
malicious
and
spiteful
powers
destine
him
a
lover
oh
take
either
title
from
him
or
from
me
a
life
which
can
render
me
no
satisfaction
since
your
cruel
laws
permit
it
not
for
nor
his
to
bless
the
now
sylvia
philander
after
i
had
dismissed
my
page
this
morning
with
my
letter
i
walked
filled
with
sad
soft
thoughts
of
my
brother
into
the
grove
and
commanding
to
retire
who
only
attended
me
i
threw
myself
down
on
that
bank
of
grass
where
we
last
disputed
the
dear
but
fatal
business
of
our
souls
where
our
prints
that
invited
me
still
remain
on
the
pressed
greens
there
with
ten
thousand
sighs
with
remembrance
of
the
tender
minutes
we
passed
then
i
drew
your
last
letter
from
my
bosom
and
often
kissed
and
often
read
it
over
but
oh
who
can
conceive
my
torment
when
i
came
to
that
fatal
part
of
it
where
you
say
you
gave
your
hand
to
my
sister
i
found
my
soul
agitated
with
a
thousand
different
passions
but
all
insupportable
all
mad
and
raving
sometimes
i
threw
myself
with
fury
on
the
ground
and
pressed
my
panting
heart
to
the
earth
then
rise
in
rage
and
tear
my
heart
and
hardly
spare
that
face
that
taught
you
first
to
love
then
fold
my
wretched
arms
to
keep
down
rising
sighs
that
almost
rend
my
breast
i
traverse
swiftly
the
conscious
grove
with
my
distracted
show
ring
eyes
directed
in
vain
to
pitiless
heaven
the
lovely
silent
shade
favouring
my
complaints
i
cry
aloud
oh
god
married
the
lovely
charming
thing
for
whom
i
languish
is
married
that
fatal
word
s
enough
i
need
not
add
to
whom
married
is
enough
to
make
me
curse
my
birth
my
youth
my
beauty
and
my
eyes
that
first
betrayed
me
to
the
undoing
object
curse
on
the
charms
you
have
flattered
for
every
fancied
grace
has
helped
my
ruin
on
now
like
flowers
that
wither
unseen
and
unpossessed
in
shades
they
must
die
and
be
no
more
they
were
to
no
end
created
since
is
married
married
oh
fate
oh
hell
oh
torture
and
confusion
tell
me
not
it
is
to
my
sister
that
addition
is
needless
and
vain
to
make
me
eternally
wretched
there
needs
no
more
than
that
is
married
than
that
the
priest
gave
your
hand
away
from
me
to
another
and
not
to
me
tired
out
with
life
i
need
no
other
than
this
repetition
is
married
tis
that
alone
is
sufficient
to
lay
in
her
cold
tomb
wretched
and
despairing
wednesday
night
sylvia
sylvia
twice
last
night
oh
unfaithful
and
unloving
i
sent
the
page
to
the
old
place
for
letters
but
he
returned
the
object
of
my
rage
because
without
the
least
remembrance
from
my
fickle
maid
in
this
torment
unable
to
hide
my
disorder
i
suffered
myself
to
be
laid
in
bed
where
the
restless
torments
of
the
night
exceeded
those
of
the
day
and
are
not
even
by
the
languisher
himself
to
be
expressed
but
the
returning
light
brought
a
short
slumber
on
its
wings
which
was
interrupted
by
my
atoning
boy
who
brought
two
letters
from
my
adorable
he
waked
me
from
dreams
more
agreeable
than
all
my
watchful
hours
could
bring
for
they
are
all
and
even
the
softest
mixed
with
a
thousand
despairs
difficulties
and
disappointments
but
these
were
all
love
which
gave
a
loose
to
joys
undenied
by
honour
and
this
way
my
charming
you
shall
be
mine
in
spite
of
all
the
tyrannies
of
that
cruel
hinderer
honour
appears
not
my
within
the
curtains
in
shades
and
gloomy
light
the
phantom
frights
not
but
when
one
beholds
its
blushes
when
it
is
attended
and
adorned
and
the
sun
sees
its
false
beauties
in
silent
groves
and
grottoes
dark
alcoves
and
lonely
recesses
all
its
formalities
are
laid
aside
it
was
then
and
there
methought
my
yielded
with
a
faint
struggle
and
a
soft
resistance
i
heard
her
broken
sighs
her
tender
whispering
voice
that
trembling
cried
oh
can
you
be
so
cruel
have
you
the
heart
will
you
undo
a
maid
because
she
loves
you
oh
will
you
ruin
me
because
you
may
my
faithless
my
unkind
then
sighed
and
yielded
and
made
me
happier
than
a
triumphing
god
but
this
was
still
a
dream
i
waked
and
sighed
and
found
it
vanished
all
but
oh
my
your
letters
were
substantial
pleasure
and
pardon
your
adorer
if
he
tell
you
even
the
disorder
you
express
is
infinitely
dear
to
him
since
he
knows
it
all
the
effects
of
love
love
my
soul
which
you
in
vain
oppose
pursue
it
dear
and
call
it
not
undoing
or
else
explain
your
fear
and
tell
me
what
your
soft
your
trembling
heart
gives
that
cruel
title
to
is
it
undoing
to
love
and
love
the
man
you
say
has
youth
and
beauty
to
justify
that
love
a
man
that
adores
you
with
so
submissive
and
perfect
a
resignation
a
man
that
did
not
only
love
first
but
is
resolved
to
die
in
that
agreeable
flame
in
my
creation
i
was
formed
for
love
and
destined
for
my
and
she
for
her
and
shall
we
can
we
disappoint
our
fate
no
my
soft
charmer
our
souls
were
touched
with
the
same
shafts
of
love
before
they
had
a
being
in
our
bodies
and
can
we
contradict
divine
decree
or
is
it
undoing
dear
to
bless
with
what
you
must
some
time
or
other
sacrifice
to
some
hated
loathed
object
for
can
never
love
again
and
are
those
treasures
for
the
dull
conjugal
lover
to
rifle
was
the
beauty
of
divine
shape
created
for
the
cold
matrimonial
embrace
and
shall
the
eternal
joys
that
can
dispense
be
returned
by
the
clumsy
husband
s
careless
forced
insipid
duties
oh
my
shall
a
husband
whose
insensibility
will
call
those
raptures
of
joy
those
heavenly
blisses
the
drudgery
of
life
shall
he
i
say
receive
them
while
your
with
the
very
thought
of
the
excess
of
pleasure
the
least
possession
would
afford
faints
over
the
paper
that
brings
here
his
eternal
vows
oh
where
my
lies
the
undoing
then
my
quality
and
fortune
are
of
the
highest
rank
amongst
men
my
youth
gay
and
fond
my
soul
all
soft
all
love
and
all
i
adore
her
i
am
sick
of
love
and
sick
of
life
till
she
yields
till
she
is
all
mine
you
say
my
i
am
married
and
there
my
happiness
is
shipwrecked
but
i
deny
it
and
will
not
have
you
think
it
no
my
soul
was
married
to
yours
in
its
first
creation
and
only
is
the
wife
of
my
sacred
my
everlasting
vows
of
my
solemn
considerate
thoughts
of
my
ripened
judgement
my
mature
considerations
the
rest
are
all
repented
and
forgot
like
the
hasty
follies
of
unsteady
youth
like
vows
breathed
in
anger
and
die
perjured
as
soon
as
vented
and
unregarded
either
of
heaven
or
man
oh
why
should
my
soul
suffer
for
ever
why
eternal
pain
for
the
unheedy
sin
of
my
unwilling
lips
besides
this
fatal
thing
called
wife
this
unlucky
sister
this
this
stop
to
all
my
heaven
that
breeds
such
fatal
differences
in
our
affairs
this
i
say
first
broke
her
to
me
i
blame
her
not
nor
is
it
reasonable
i
should
she
saw
the
young
and
loved
him
whom
the
envying
world
in
spite
of
prejudice
must
own
has
irresistible
charms
that
godlike
form
that
sweetness
in
his
face
that
softness
in
his
eyes
and
delicate
mouth
and
every
beauty
besides
that
women
dote
on
and
men
envy
that
lovely
composition
of
man
and
angel
with
the
addition
of
his
eternal
youth
and
illustrious
birth
was
formed
by
heaven
and
nature
for
universal
conquest
and
who
can
love
the
charming
hero
at
a
cheaper
rate
than
being
undone
and
she
that
would
not
venture
fame
honour
and
a
for
the
glory
of
the
young
heart
merits
not
the
noble
victim
oh
would
i
could
say
so
much
for
the
young
who
would
run
a
thousand
times
more
hazards
of
life
and
fortune
for
the
adorable
than
that
amorous
hero
ever
did
for
though
from
that
prince
i
learned
some
of
my
disguises
for
my
thefts
of
love
for
he
like
courted
in
several
shapes
i
saw
them
all
and
suffered
the
delusion
to
pass
upon
me
for
i
had
seen
the
lovely
yes
i
had
seen
her
and
loved
her
too
but
honour
kept
me
yet
master
of
my
vows
but
when
i
knew
her
false
when
i
was
once
confirmed
when
by
my
own
soul
i
found
the
dissembled
passion
of
hers
when
she
could
no
longer
hide
the
blushes
or
the
paleness
that
seized
at
the
approaches
of
my
disordered
rival
when
i
saw
love
dancing
in
her
eyes
and
her
false
heart
beat
with
nimble
motions
and
soft
trembling
seized
every
limb
at
the
approach
or
touch
of
the
royal
lover
then
i
thought
myself
no
longer
obliged
to
conceal
my
flame
for
nay
ere
i
broke
silence
ere
i
discovered
the
hidden
treasure
of
my
heart
i
made
her
falsehood
plainer
yet
even
the
time
and
place
of
the
dear
assignations
i
discovered
certainty
happy
certainty
broke
the
dull
heavy
chain
and
i
with
joy
submitted
to
my
shameful
freedom
and
caressed
my
generous
rival
nay
and
by
heaven
i
loved
him
for
it
pleased
at
the
resemblance
of
our
souls
for
we
were
secret
lovers
both
but
more
pleased
that
he
loved
for
that
made
way
to
my
passion
for
the
adorable
let
the
dull
jealous
fool
upbraid
me
with
cold
patience
let
the
fond
coxcomb
whose
honour
depends
on
the
frail
reproach
me
or
tell
me
that
my
reputation
depends
on
the
feeble
constancy
of
a
wife
persuade
me
it
is
honour
to
fight
for
an
irretrievable
and
unvalued
prize
and
that
because
my
rival
has
taken
leave
to
cuckold
me
i
shall
give
him
leave
to
kill
me
too
unreasonable
nonsense
grown
to
custom
no
by
heaven
i
had
gather
should
be
false
as
she
is
than
wish
and
languish
for
the
happy
occasion
the
sin
is
the
same
only
the
act
is
more
generous
believe
me
my
we
have
all
false
notions
of
virtue
and
honour
and
surely
this
was
taken
up
by
some
despairing
husband
in
love
with
a
fair
jilting
wife
and
then
i
pardon
him
i
should
have
done
as
much
for
only
she
that
has
my
soul
can
engage
my
sword
she
that
i
love
and
myself
only
commands
and
keeps
my
stock
of
honour
for
the
charming
the
distracting
i
could
fight
for
a
glance
or
smile
expose
my
heart
for
her
dearer
fame
and
wish
no
recompense
but
breathing
out
my
last
gasp
into
her
soft
white
delicate
bosom
but
for
a
wife
that
stranger
to
my
soul
and
whom
we
wed
for
interest
and
necessity
a
wife
light
loose
unregarding
property
who
for
a
momentary
appetite
will
expose
her
fame
without
the
noble
end
of
loving
on
she
that
will
abuse
my
bed
and
yet
return
again
to
the
loathed
conjugal
embrace
back
to
the
arms
so
hated
and
even
strong
fancy
of
the
absent
youth
beloved
can
not
so
much
as
render
supportable
curse
on
her
and
yet
she
kisses
fawns
and
dissembles
on
hangs
on
his
neck
and
makes
the
sot
believe
damn
her
brute
i
ll
whistle
her
off
and
let
her
down
the
wind
as
says
no
i
adore
the
wife
that
when
the
heart
is
gone
boldly
and
nobly
pursues
the
conqueror
and
generously
owns
the
whore
not
poorly
adds
the
nauseous
sin
of
jilting
to
it
that
i
could
have
borne
at
least
commended
but
this
can
never
pardon
at
worst
then
the
world
had
said
her
passion
had
undone
her
she
loved
and
love
at
worst
is
worthy
of
pity
no
no
i
forgive
your
love
but
never
can
your
poor
dissimulation
one
drives
you
but
from
the
heart
you
value
not
but
the
other
to
my
eternal
contempt
one
deprives
me
but
of
thee
but
the
other
entitles
me
to
a
beauty
more
surprising
renders
thee
no
part
of
me
and
so
leaves
the
lover
free
to
without
the
brother
thus
my
excellent
maid
i
have
sent
you
the
sense
and
truth
of
my
soul
in
an
affair
you
have
often
hinted
to
me
and
i
take
no
pleasure
to
remember
i
hope
you
will
at
least
think
my
aversion
reasonable
and
that
being
thus
indisputably
free
from
all
obligations
to
as
a
husband
i
may
be
permitted
to
lay
claim
to
as
a
lover
and
marry
myself
more
effectually
by
my
everlasting
vows
than
the
priest
by
his
common
method
could
do
to
any
other
woman
less
beloved
there
being
no
other
way
at
present
left
by
heaven
to
render
me
happy
lover
and
i
die
to
see
philander
sylvia
when
i
had
sealed
the
enclosed
told
me
you
were
this
morning
come
from
and
with
infinite
impatience
have
expected
seeing
you
here
which
deferred
my
sending
this
to
the
old
place
and
i
am
so
vain
oh
adorable
as
to
believe
my
fancied
silence
has
given
you
disquiets
but
sure
my
could
not
charge
me
with
neglect
no
she
knows
my
soul
and
lays
it
all
on
chance
or
some
strange
accident
she
knows
no
business
could
divert
me
no
were
the
nation
sinking
the
great
senate
of
the
world
confounded
our
glorious
designs
betrayed
and
ruined
and
the
vast
city
all
in
flames
like
unconcerned
i
would
sing
my
everlasting
song
of
love
to
which
no
time
or
fortune
shall
untune
i
know
my
soul
and
all
its
strength
and
how
it
is
fortified
the
charming
of
my
young
will
for
ever
remain
there
the
original
may
fade
time
may
render
it
less
fair
less
blooming
in
my
arms
but
never
in
my
soul
i
shall
find
thee
there
the
same
gay
glorious
creature
that
first
surprised
and
enslaved
me
believe
me
ravishing
maid
i
shall
why
then
oh
why
my
cruel
are
my
joys
delayed
why
am
i
by
your
rigorous
commands
kept
from
the
sight
of
my
heaven
my
eternal
bliss
an
age
my
fair
tormentor
is
past
four
tedious
days
are
numbered
over
since
i
beheld
the
object
of
my
lasting
vows
my
eternal
wishes
how
can
you
think
oh
unreasonable
that
i
could
live
so
long
without
you
and
yet
i
am
alive
i
find
it
by
my
pain
by
torments
of
fears
and
jealousies
insupportable
i
languish
and
go
downward
to
the
earth
where
you
will
shortly
see
me
laid
without
your
recalling
mercy
it
is
true
i
move
about
this
unregarded
world
appear
every
day
in
the
great
at
clubs
cabals
and
private
consultations
for
knows
all
the
business
of
my
soul
even
in
politics
of
state
as
well
as
love
i
say
i
appear
indeed
and
give
my
voice
in
public
business
but
oh
my
heart
more
kindly
is
employed
that
and
my
thoughts
are
ten
thousand
times
a
day
i
breathe
that
name
my
busy
fingers
are
eternally
tracing
out
those
six
mystic
letters
a
thousand
ways
on
every
thing
i
touch
form
words
and
make
them
speak
a
thousand
things
and
all
are
still
my
melancholy
change
is
evident
to
all
that
see
me
which
they
interpret
many
mistaken
ways
our
party
fancy
i
repent
my
league
with
them
and
doubting
i
ll
betray
the
cause
grow
jealous
of
me
till
by
new
oaths
new
arguments
i
confirm
them
then
they
smile
all
and
cry
i
am
in
love
and
this
they
would
believe
but
that
they
see
all
women
that
i
meet
or
converse
with
are
indifferent
to
me
and
so
can
fix
it
no
where
for
none
can
guess
it
thus
while
i
dare
not
tell
my
soul
no
not
even
to
the
stifled
flame
burns
inward
and
torments
me
so
that
unlike
the
thing
i
was
i
fear
will
lose
her
love
and
lover
too
for
those
few
charms
she
said
i
had
will
fade
and
this
fatal
distance
will
destroy
both
soul
and
body
too
my
very
reason
will
abandon
me
and
i
shall
rave
to
see
thee
restore
me
oh
restore
me
then
to
happy
still
blest
with
presence
permit
me
oh
permit
me
into
those
sacred
shades
where
i
have
been
so
often
too
innocently
blest
let
me
survey
again
the
dear
character
of
on
the
smooth
birch
oh
when
shall
i
sit
beneath
those
boughs
gazing
on
the
young
goddess
of
the
grove
hearing
her
sigh
for
love
touching
her
glowing
small
white
hands
beholding
her
killing
eyes
languish
and
her
charming
bosom
rise
and
fall
with
d
uncertain
breath
breath
as
soft
and
sweet
as
the
restoring
breeze
that
glides
o
er
the
flowers
but
oh
what
is
it
what
heaven
of
perfumes
when
it
inclines
to
the
ravish
d
and
whispers
love
it
dares
not
name
aloud
what
power
me
then
from
rushing
on
thee
from
pressing
thee
with
kisses
folding
thee
in
my
transported
arms
and
following
all
the
dictates
of
love
without
respect
or
awe
what
is
it
oh
my
can
detain
a
love
so
violent
and
raving
and
so
wild
admit
me
sacred
maid
admit
me
again
to
those
soft
delights
that
i
may
find
if
possible
what
divinity
envious
of
my
bliss
checks
my
eager
joys
my
raging
flame
while
you
too
make
an
experiment
worth
the
trial
what
tis
makes
deny
her
philander
page
is
ill
and
i
am
oblig
d
to
brilliard
these
to
the
dear
cottage
of
their
rendezvous
send
me
your
opinion
of
his
fidelity
and
ah
remember
i
die
to
see
philander
not
yet
not
yet
oh
ye
dull
tedious
hours
when
will
you
glide
away
and
bring
that
happy
moment
on
in
which
i
shall
at
least
hear
from
my
eight
and
forty
tedious
ones
are
past
and
i
am
here
forgotten
still
forlorn
impatient
restless
every
where
not
one
of
all
your
little
moments
ye
undiverting
hours
can
afford
me
repose
i
drag
ye
on
a
heavy
load
i
count
ye
all
and
bless
ye
when
you
are
gone
but
tremble
at
the
approaching
ones
and
with
a
dread
expect
you
and
nothing
will
divert
me
now
my
couch
is
tiresome
my
glass
is
vain
my
books
are
dull
and
conversation
insupportable
the
grove
affords
me
no
relief
nor
even
those
birds
to
whom
i
have
so
often
breath
d
name
they
sing
it
on
their
perching
boughs
no
nor
the
reviewing
of
his
dear
letters
can
bring
me
any
ease
oh
what
fate
is
reserved
for
me
for
thus
i
can
not
live
nor
surely
thus
i
shall
not
die
perhaps
making
a
trial
of
virtue
by
this
silence
pursue
it
call
up
all
your
reason
my
lovely
brother
to
your
aid
let
us
be
wise
and
silent
let
us
try
what
that
will
do
towards
the
cure
of
this
too
infectious
flame
let
us
oh
let
us
my
brother
sit
down
here
and
pursue
the
crime
of
loving
on
no
farther
call
me
sister
swear
i
am
so
and
nothing
but
your
sister
and
forbear
oh
forbear
my
charming
brother
to
pursue
me
farther
with
your
soft
bewitching
passion
let
me
alone
let
me
be
ruin
d
with
honour
if
i
must
be
ruin
for
oh
twere
much
happier
i
were
no
more
than
that
i
should
be
more
than
sister
or
he
than
brother
oh
let
me
ever
call
you
by
that
cold
name
till
that
of
lover
be
forgotten
ha
methinks
on
the
sudden
a
fit
of
virtue
informs
my
soul
and
bids
me
ask
you
for
what
sin
of
mine
my
charming
brother
you
still
pursue
a
maid
that
can
not
fly
ungenerous
and
unkind
why
did
you
take
advantage
of
those
freedoms
i
gave
you
as
a
brother
i
smil
d
on
you
and
sometimes
kiss
d
you
too
but
for
my
sister
s
sake
i
play
d
with
you
suffer
d
your
hands
and
lips
to
wander
where
i
dare
not
now
all
which
i
thought
a
sister
might
allow
a
brother
and
knew
not
all
the
while
the
treachery
of
love
oh
none
but
under
that
intimate
title
of
a
brother
could
have
had
the
opportunity
to
have
ruin
d
me
that
that
betray
d
me
i
play
d
away
my
heart
at
a
game
i
did
not
understand
nor
knew
i
when
twas
lost
by
degrees
so
subtle
and
an
authority
so
lawful
you
won
me
out
of
all
nay
then
too
even
when
all
was
lost
i
would
not
think
it
love
i
wonder
d
what
my
sleepless
nights
my
waking
eternal
thoughts
and
slumbering
visions
of
my
lovely
brother
meant
i
wonder
d
why
my
soul
was
continually
fill
d
with
wishes
and
new
desires
and
still
concluded
twas
for
my
sister
all
till
i
discover
d
the
cheat
by
jealousy
for
when
my
sister
hung
upon
your
neck
kiss
d
and
caress
d
that
face
that
i
ador
d
oh
how
i
found
my
colour
change
my
limbs
all
trembled
and
my
blood
enrag
d
and
i
could
scarce
forbear
reproaching
you
or
crying
out
oh
why
this
fondness
brother
sometimes
you
perceiv
d
my
concern
at
which
you
d
smile
for
you
who
had
been
before
in
love
a
curse
upon
the
fatal
time
could
guess
at
my
disorder
then
would
you
turn
the
wanton
play
on
me
when
sullen
with
my
jealousy
and
the
cause
i
fly
your
soft
embrace
yet
wish
you
would
pursue
and
overtake
me
which
you
ne
er
fail
d
to
do
where
after
a
kind
quarrel
all
was
pardon
d
and
all
was
well
again
while
the
poor
injur
d
innocent
my
sister
made
herself
sport
at
our
delusive
wars
still
i
was
ignorant
till
you
in
a
most
fatal
hour
inform
d
me
i
was
a
lover
thus
was
it
with
my
heart
in
those
blest
days
of
innocence
thus
it
was
won
and
lost
nor
can
all
my
stars
in
heav
n
prevent
i
doubt
prevent
my
ruin
now
you
are
sure
of
the
fatal
conquest
you
scorn
the
trifling
glory
you
are
silent
now
oh
i
am
inevitably
lost
or
with
you
or
without
you
and
i
find
by
this
little
silence
and
absence
of
yours
that
tis
most
certain
i
must
either
die
or
be
sylvia
dorillus
not
with
a
letter
or
that
my
page
whom
i
have
sent
to
this
cottage
for
one
bring
it
not
i
can
not
support
my
life
for
philander
have
a
thousand
wild
distracting
fears
knowing
how
you
are
involv
d
in
the
interest
you
have
espoused
with
the
cesario
danger
surrounds
you
how
your
life
and
glory
depend
on
the
frail
sacrifice
of
villains
and
rebels
oh
give
me
leave

why

why

some
little
god
of
love
bring
the
grateful

on
his
painted
wings
if
sick
why
does

my

by

that
is

and
busy
in

if
you

false
if
you

of

strike
me
for
ever
silent
lay
me
for
ever
quiet
lost
to
the
world
lost
to
my
faithless
charmer
but
if
a
sense
of
honour
in
you
has

prefer
mine
before
your

will
it

can
i

the
crime
that
made
her
lose
your

will
make
me
mistress
of
it
no
if
by
any
action

oh
if
all
were

that
busy
babbler
says
what
lady
has
her
fame
what
husband
is
not
a
cuckold

and
a

him
that
made
him
so
and
it
is
in

my
too
subtle
brother
you
think
to
build
the
trophies
of
your
conquests
on
the
ruin
of
both
fame
and
mine
oh
how
dear
would
your
inglorious
passion
cost
the
great
unfortunate
house
of
the
while
you
poorly
ruin
the
fame
of
to
make
way
to

as
violent
for

all
the

oaths
protestations
tears
and
prayers
you
make
and
pay
at
my
feet
are
but
the
faint

the
feeble
echoes
of
what
you
sigh
d
out
at
hers
nay
like
young
fled
with
the
fair
prize
your
fond
your
eager
passion
made
it
a
rape
oh
perfidious
let
me
not
call
it
back
to
my
oh
let
me
die
rather
than
call
to
mind
a
time
so
fatal
when
the
lovely
false
vow
d
his
heart
his
faithless
heart
away
to
any
maid
but
oh
let
it
not
be
possible
for
me
to
imagine
his
dear
arms
ever
grasping
any
body
with
joy
but
and
yet
they
did
with
transports
of
love
yes
yes
you
lov
d
by
heaven
you
lov
d
this
false
this
perfidious
for
false
she
is
you
lov
d
her
and
i
ll
have
it
so
nor
shall
the
sister
in
me
plead
her
cause
she
is
false
beyond
all
pardon
for
you
are
beautiful
as
heaven
itself
can
render
you
a
shape
exactly
form
d
not
too
low
nor
too
tall
but
made
to
beget
soft
desire
and
everlasting
wishes
in
all
that
look
on
you
but
your
face
your
lovely
face
inclining
to
round
large
piercing
languishing
black
eyes
delicate
proportion
d
nose
charming
dimpled
mouth
plump
red
lips
inviting
and
swelling
white
teeth
small
and
even
fine
complexion
and
a
beautiful
turn
all
which
you
had
an
art
to
order
in
so
engaging
a
manner
that
it
charm
d
all
the
beholders
both
sexes
were
undone
with
looking
on
you
and
i
have
heard
a
witty
man
of
your
party
swear
your
face
gain
d
more
to
the
league
and
association
than
the
cause
and
has
curs
d
a
thousand
times
the
false
for
preferring
less
beautiful
to
the
adorable
to
add
to
this
heaven
how
you
spoke
when
ere
you
spoke
of
love
in
that
you
far
surpass
d
the
young
as
young
as
he
almost
as
great
and
glorious
oh
perfidious
oh
false
oh
foolish
and
ingrate
that
you
abandon
d
her
was
just
she
was
not
worth
retaining
in
your
heart
nor
could
be
worth
defending
with
your
sword
but
grant
her
false
oh
how
does
her
perfidy
entitle
you
to
me
false
as
she
is
you
still
are
married
to
her
inconstant
as
she
is
she
is
still
your
wife
and
no
breach
of
the
nuptial
vow
can
untie
the
fatal
knot
and
that
is
a
mystery
to
common
sense
sure
she
was
born
for
mischief
and
fortune
when
she
gave
her
you
designed
the
ruin
of
us
all
but
most
particularly
sylvia
sylvia
my
soul
s
eternal
joy
my
what
have
you
done
and
oh
how
durst
you
knowing
my
fond
heart
try
it
with
so
fatal
a
stroke
what
means
this
severe
letter
and
why
so
eagerly
at
this
time
oh
the
day
is
virtue
so
defended
is
it
a
question
now
whether
she
is
false
or
not
oh
poor
oh
frivolous
excuse
you
love
me
not
by
all
that
s
good
you
love
me
not
to
try
your
power
you
have
flatter
d
and
feign
d
oh
woman
false
charming
woman
you
have
undone
me
i
rave
and
shall
commit
such
extravagance
that
will
ruin
both
i
must
upbraid
you
fickle
and
inconstant
i
must
and
this
distance
will
not
serve
too
great
my
reproaches
lose
their
force
i
burst
with
resentment
with
injur
d
love
and
you
are
either
the
most
faithless
of
your
sex
or
the
most
malicious
and
tormenting
oh
i
am
past
tricks
my
your
little
arts
might
do
well
in
a
beginning
flame
but
to
a
settled
fire
that
is
arriv
d
to
the
highest
degree
it
does
but
damp
its
fierceness
and
instead
of
drawing
me
on
would
lessen
my
esteem
if
any
such
deceit
were
capable
to
harbour
in
the
heart
of
but
she
is
all
divine
and
i
am
mistaken
in
the
meaning
of
what
she
says
oh
my
adorable
think
no
more
on
that
dull
false
thing
a
wife
let
her
be
banish
d
thy
thoughts
as
she
is
my
soul
let
her
never
appear
though
but
in
a
dream
to
fright
our
solid
joys
or
true
happiness
no
let
us
look
forward
to
pleasures
vast
and
unconfin
d
to
coming
transports
and
leave
all
behind
us
that
contributes
not
to
that
heaven
of
bliss
remember
oh
that
five
tedious
days
are
past
since
i
sigh
d
at
your
dear
feet
and
five
days
to
a
man
so
madly
in
love
as
your
is
a
tedious
age
now
six
o
clock
in
the
morning
will
be
with
you
by
eight
and
by
ten
i
may
have
your
permission
to
see
you
and
then
i
need
not
say
how
soon
i
will
present
myself
before
you
at
for
heaven
s
sake
my
eternal
blessing
if
you
design
me
this
happiness
contrive
it
so
that
i
may
see
no
body
that
belongs
to
but
the
fair
the
lovely
for
i
must
be
more
moments
with
you
than
will
be
convenient
to
be
taken
notice
of
lest
they
suspect
our
business
to
be
love
and
that
discovery
yet
may
ruin
us
oh
i
will
delay
no
longer
my
soul
is
impatient
to
see
you
i
can
not
live
another
night
without
it
i
die
by
heaven
i
languish
for
the
appointed
hour
you
will
believe
when
you
see
my
languid
face
and
dying
eyes
how
much
and
greater
a
sufferer
in
love
i
am
my
soul
s
delight
you
may
perhaps
deny
me
from
your
fear
but
oh
do
not
though
i
ask
a
mighty
blessing
company
alone
silent
and
perhaps
by
dark
oh
though
i
faint
with
the
thought
only
of
so
bless
d
an
opportunity
yet
you
shall
secure
me
by
what
vows
what
imprecations
or
ties
you
please
bind
my
busy
hands
blind
my
ravish
d
eyes
command
my
tongue
do
what
you
will
but
let
me
hear
your
angel
s
voice
and
have
the
transported
joy
of
throwing
my
self
at
your
feet
and
if
you
please
give
me
leave
a
man
condemned
eternally
to
love
to
plead
a
little
for
my
life
and
passion
let
me
remove
your
fears
and
though
that
mighty
task
never
make
me
entirely
happy
at
least
it
will
be
a
great
satisfaction
to
me
to
know
that
tis
not
through
my
own
fault
that
i
am
the
philander
have
order
brilliard
wait
your
commands
cottage
that
he
may
not
be
seen
bellfont
to
see
me
or
i
shall
come
without
order
and
injure
both
my
dear
damn
d
wife
is
dispos
d
of
at
a
cesario
the
opportunity
will
be
lucky
not
that
i
fear
her
jealousy
but
the
effects
of
philander
i
tremble
with
the
apprehension
of
what
you
ask
how
shall
i
comply
with
your
fond
desires
my
soul
bodes
some
dire
effect
of
this
bold
enterprise
for
i
must
own
and
blush
while
i
do
own
it
that
my
soul
yields
obedience
to
your
soft
request
and
even
whilst
i
read
your
letter
was
diverted
with
the
contrivance
of
seeing
you
for
though
as
my
brother
you
have
all
the
freedoms
imaginable
at
to
entertain
and
walk
with
me
yet
it
would
be
difficult
and
prejudicial
to
my
honour
to
receive
you
alone
any
where
without
my
sister
and
cause
a
suspicion
which
all
about
me
now
are
very
far
from
conceiving
except
my
faithful
confidante
and
too
fatal
counsellor
and
but
for
this
fear
i
know
my
charming
brother
three
little
leagues
should
not
five
long
days
separate
from
his
but
my
lovely
brother
since
you
beg
it
so
earnestly
and
my
heart
consents
so
easily
i
must
pronounce
my
own
doom
and
say
come
my
whether
love
or
soft
desire
invites
you
and
take
this
direction
in
the
management
of
this
mighty
affair
i
would
have
you
as
soon
as
this
comes
to
your
hands
to
haste
to
cottage
without
your
equipage
only
whom
i
believe
you
may
trust
both
from
his
own
discretion
and
your
vast
bounties
to
him
wait
there
till
you
receive
my
commands
and
i
will
retire
betimes
to
my
apartment
pretending
not
to
be
well
and
as
soon
as
the
evening
s
obscurity
will
permit
shall
let
you
in
at
the
that
is
next
the
unseen
and
unsuspected
but
oh
thou
powerful
charmer
have
a
care
i
trust
you
with
my
all
my
dear
dear
my
precious
honour
guard
it
well
for
oh
i
fear
my
forces
are
too
weak
to
stand
your
shock
of
beauties
you
have
charms
enough
to
justify
my
yielding
but
yet
by
heaven
i
would
not
for
an
empire
but
what
is
dull
empire
to
almighty
love
the
god
subdues
the
monarch
tis
to
your
strength
i
trust
for
i
am
a
feeble
woman
a
virgin
quite
disarm
d
by
two
fair
eyes
an
angel
s
voice
and
form
but
yet
i
ll
die
before
i
ll
yield
my
honour
no
though
our
unhappy
family
have
met
reproach
from
the
imagined
levity
of
my
sister
tis
i
ll
redeem
the
bleeding
honour
of
our
family
and
my
great
parents
virtues
shall
shine
in
me
i
know
it
for
if
it
passes
this
test
if
i
can
stand
this
temptation
i
am
proof
against
all
the
world
but
i
conjure
you
aid
me
if
i
need
it
if
i
incline
but
in
a
languishing
look
if
but
a
wish
appear
in
my
eyes
or
i
betray
consent
but
in
a
sigh
take
not
oh
take
not
the
opportunity
lest
when
you
have
done
i
grow
raging
mad
and
discover
all
in
the
wild
fit
oh
who
would
venture
on
an
enemy
with
such
unequal
force
what
hardy
fool
would
hazard
all
at
sea
that
sees
the
rising
storm
come
rolling
on
who
but
fond
woman
giddy
heedless
woman
would
thus
expose
her
virtue
to
temptation
i
see
i
know
my
danger
yet
i
must
permit
it
love
soft
bewitching
love
will
have
it
so
that
can
not
deny
what
my
feebler
honour
forbids
and
though
i
tremble
with
fear
yet
love
suggests
it
will
be
an
age
to
night
i
long
for
my
undoing
for
oh
i
can
not
stand
the
batteries
of
your
eyes
and
tongue
these
fears
these
conflicts
i
have
a
thousand
times
it
is
pitiful
sometimes
to
see
me
on
one
hand
a
thousand
all
gay
and
smiling
present
with
all
the
beauties
of
his
sex
with
all
the
softness
in
his
looks
and
language
those
gods
of
love
can
inspire
with
all
the
charms
of
youth
adorn
d
bewitching
all
and
all
transporting
on
the
other
hand
a
poor
lost
virgin
languishing
and
undone
sighing
her
willing
rape
to
the
deaf
shades
and
fountains
filling
the
woods
with
cries
swelling
the
murmuring
rivulets
with
tears
her
noble
parents
with
a
generous
rage
reviling
her
and
her
betray
d
sister
loading
her
bow
d
head
with
curses
and
reproaches
and
all
about
her
looking
forlorn
and
sad
judge
oh
judge
my
adorable
brother
of
the
vastness
of
my
courage
and
passion
when
even
this
deplorable
prospect
can
not
defend
me
from
the
resolution
of
giving
you
admittance
into
my
apartment
this
night
nor
shall
ever
drive
you
from
the
soul
of
your
sylvia
sylvia
i
have
obey
d
my
dear
commands
and
the
dictates
of
my
own
impatient
soul
as
soon
as
i
receiv
d
them
i
immediately
took
horse
for
though
i
knew
i
should
not
see
my
adorable
eight
or
nine
at
night
but
oh
tis
wondrous
pleasure
to
be
so
much
more
near
my
eternal
joy
i
wait
at
cottage
the
tedious
approaching
night
that
must
shelter
me
in
its
kind
shades
and
conduct
me
to
a
pleasure
i
faint
but
with
imagining
tis
now
my
lovely
charmer
three
o
clock
and
oh
how
many
tedious
hours
i
am
to
languish
here
before
the
blessed
one
arrive
i
know
you
love
my
and
therefore
must
guess
at
some
part
of
my
torment
which
yet
is
mix
d
with
a
certain
trembling
joy
not
to
be
imagin
d
by
any
but
who
surely
loves
if
there
be
truth
in
beauty
faith
in
youth
she
surely
loves
him
much
and
much
more
above
her
sex
she
is
capable
of
love
by
how
much
more
her
soul
is
form
d
of
a
softer
and
more
delicate
composition
by
how
much
more
her
wit
s
refin
d
and
elevated
above
her
duller
sex
and
by
how
much
more
she
is
oblig
d
if
passion
can
claim
passion
in
return
sure
no
beauty
was
ever
so
much
indebted
to
a
slave
as
to
none
ever
lov
d
like
me
judge
then
my
pains
of
love
my
joys
my
fears
my
impatience
and
desires
and
call
me
to
your
sacred
presence
with
all
the
speed
of
love
and
as
soon
as
it
is
duskish
imagine
me
in
the
meadow
behind
the
grove
till
when
think
me
employed
in
eternal
thoughts
of
restless
and
talking
to
the
trees
of
sighing
her
charming
name
circling
with
folded
arms
my
panting
heart
that
beats
and
trembles
the
more
the
nearer
it
approaches
the
happy
and
fortifying
the
feeble
trembler
against
a
sight
so
ravishing
and
surprising
i
fear
to
be
sustain
d
with
life
but
if
i
faint
in
arms
it
will
be
happier
far
than
all
the
glories
of
life
without
her
send
my
angel
something
from
you
to
make
the
hours
less
tedious
consider
me
love
me
and
be
as
impatient
as
i
that
you
may
the
sooner
find
at
your
feet
your
everlasting
lover
philander
philander
i
have
at
last
recover
d
sense
enough
to
tell
you
i
have
receiv
d
your
letter
by
and
which
had
like
to
have
been
discover
d
for
he
prudently
enough
put
it
under
the
strawberries
he
brought
me
in
a
basket
fearing
he
should
get
no
other
opportunity
to
have
given
it
me
and
my
mother
seeing
them
look
so
fair
and
fresh
snatch
d
the
basket
with
a
greediness
i
have
not
seen
in
her
before
whilst
she
was
calling
to
her
page
for
a
porcelain
dish
to
put
them
out
had
an
opportunity
to
hint
to
me
what
lay
at
the
bottom
heavens
had
you
seen
my
disorder
and
confusion
what
should
i
do
love
had
not
one
invention
in
store
and
here
it
was
that
all
the
subtlety
of
women
abandon
d
me
oh
heavens
how
cold
and
pale
i
grew
lest
the
most
important
business
of
my
life
should
be
betray
d
and
ruin
d
but
not
to
terrify
you
longer
with
fears
of
my
danger
the
dish
came
and
out
the
strawberries
were
pour
d
and
the
basket
thrown
aside
on
the
bank
where
my
mother
sat
for
we
were
in
the
garden
when
we
met
accidentally
first
with
the
basket
there
were
some
leaves
of
fern
put
at
the
bottom
between
the
basket
and
letter
which
by
good
fortune
came
not
out
with
the
strawberries
and
after
a
minute
or
two
i
took
up
the
basket
and
walking
carelessly
up
and
down
the
garden
gather
d
here
and
there
a
flower
pinks
and
jessamine
and
filling
my
basket
sat
down
again
till
my
mother
had
eat
her
fill
of
the
fruit
and
gave
me
an
opportunity
to
retire
to
my
apartment
where
opening
the
letter
and
finding
you
so
near
and
waiting
to
see
me
i
had
certainly
sunk
down
on
the
floor
had
not
supported
me
who
only
was
by
something
so
new
and
till
now
so
strange
seiz
d
me
at
the
thought
of
so
secret
an
interview
that
i
lost
all
my
senses
and
life
wholly
departing
i
rested
on
without
breath
or
motion
the
violent
effects
of
love
and
honour
the
impetuous
meeting
tides
of
the
extremes
of
joy
and
fear
rushing
on
too
suddenly
overwhelm
d
my
senses
and
it
was
a
pretty
while
before
i
recover
d
strength
to
get
to
my
cabinet
where
a
second
time
i
open
d
your
letter
and
read
it
again
with
a
thousand
changes
of
countenance
my
whole
mass
of
blood
was
in
that
moment
so
discompos
d
that
i
chang
d
from
an
ague
to
a
fever
several
times
in
a
minute
oh
what
will
all
this
bring
me
to
and
where
will
the
raging
fit
end
i
die
with
that
thought
my
guilty
pen
slackens
in
my
trembling
hand
and
i
languish
and
fall
over
the
d
paper
oh
help
me
some
divinity
or
if
you
did
i
fear
i
should
be
angry
oh
a
thousand
passions
and
distracted
thoughts
crowd
to
get
out
and
make
their
soft
complaints
to
thee
but
oh
they
lose
themselves
with
mixing
they
are
blended
in
a
confusion
together
and
love
nor
art
can
divide
them
to
deal
them
out
in
order
sometimes
i
would
tell
you
of
my
joy
at
your
arrival
and
my
unspeaking
transports
at
the
thought
of
seeing
you
so
soon
that
i
shall
hear
your
charming
voice
and
find
you
at
my
feet
making
soft
vows
anew
with
all
the
passion
of
an
impatient
lover
with
all
the
eloquence
that
sighs
and
cries
and
tears
from
those
lovely
eyes
can
express
and
sure
that
is
enough
to
conquer
any
where
and
to
which
coarse
vulgar
words
are
dull
the
rhetoric
of
love
is
d
interrupted
words
languishing
eyes
flattering
speeches
broken
sighs
pressing
the
hand
and
falling
tears
ah
how
do
they
not
persuade
how
do
they
not
charm
and
conquer
twas
thus
with
these
soft
easy
arts
that
first
was
won
for
sure
no
arts
of
speaking
could
have
talked
my
heart
away
though
you
can
speak
like
any
god
oh
whither
am
i
driven
what
do
i
say
twas
not
my
purpose
not
my
business
here
to
give
a
character
of
no
nor
to
speak
of
love
but
oh
like
lute
my
soul
will
sound
to
nothing
but
to
love
talk
what
you
will
begin
what
discourse
you
please
i
end
it
all
in
love
because
my
soul
is
ever
fix
d
on
and
insensibly
its
biass
leads
to
that
subject
no
i
did
not
when
i
began
to
write
think
of
speaking
one
word
of
my
own
weakness
but
to
have
told
you
with
what
resolv
d
courage
honour
and
virtue
i
expect
your
coming
and
sure
so
sacred
a
thing
as
love
was
not
made
to
ruin
these
and
therefore
in
vain
my
lovely
brother
you
will
attempt
it
and
yet
oh
heavens
i
gave
a
private
assignation
in
my
apartment
alone
and
at
night
where
silence
love
and
shades
are
all
your
friends
where
opportunity
obliges
your
passion
while
heaven
knows
not
one
of
all
these
nor
any
kind
of
power
is
friend
to
me
i
shall
be
left
to
you
and
all
these
tyrants
expos
d
without
other
guards
than
this
boasted
virtue
which
had
need
be
wondrous
to
resist
all
these
powerful
enemies
of
its
purity
and
repose
alas
i
know
not
its
strength
i
never
tried
it
yet
and
this
will
be
the
first
time
it
has
ever
been
expos
d
to
your
power
the
first
time
i
ever
had
courage
to
meet
you
as
a
lover
and
let
you
in
by
stealth
and
put
myself
unguarded
into
your
hands
oh
i
die
with
the
apprehension
of
approaching
danger
and
yet
i
have
not
power
to
retreat
i
must
on
love
compels
me
love
holds
me
fast
the
smiling
flatterer
promises
a
thousand
joys
a
thousand
ravishing
minutes
of
delight
all
innocent
and
harmless
as
his
mother
s
doves
but
oh
they
bill
and
kiss
and
do
a
thousand
things
i
must
forbid
for
i
have
often
heard
him
say
with
sighs
that
his
complexion
render
d
him
less
capable
of
the
soft
play
of
love
than
any
other
lover
i
have
seen
him
fly
my
very
touches
yet
swear
they
were
the
greatest
joy
on
earth
i
tempt
him
even
with
my
looks
from
virtue
and
when
i
ask
the
cause
or
cry
he
is
cold
he
vows
tis
because
he
dares
not
endure
my
temptations
says
his
blood
runs
hotter
and
fiercer
in
his
veins
than
any
other
s
does
nor
have
the
oft
repeated
joys
reaped
in
the
marriage
bed
any
thing
abated
that
which
he
wish
d
but
he
fear
d
would
ruin
me
thus
thus
whole
days
we
have
sat
and
gaz
d
and
sigh
d
but
durst
not
trust
our
virtues
with
fond
dalliance
my
page
is
come
to
tell
me
that
madam
the
duchess
of
is
come
to
and
i
am
oblig
d
to
quit
my
cabinet
but
with
infinite
regret
being
at
present
much
more
to
my
soul
s
content
employ
d
but
love
must
sometimes
give
place
to
and
respect
too
waits
and
tells
he
will
not
depart
without
something
for
his
lord
to
entertain
him
till
the
happy
hour
the
rustic
pleas
d
me
with
the
concern
he
had
for
my
oh
my
charming
brother
you
have
an
art
to
tame
even
savages
a
tongue
that
would
charm
and
engage
wildness
itself
to
softness
and
gentleness
and
give
the
rough
unthinking
love
tis
a
tedious
time
how
shall
i
pass
the
hours
sylvia
say
fond
love
whither
wilt
thou
lead
me
thou
hast
brought
me
from
the
noisy
hurries
of
the
town
to
charming
solitude
from
crowded
cabals
where
mighty
things
are
resolving
to
lonely
groves
to
thy
own
abodes
where
thou
dwell
st
gay
and
pleas
d
among
the
rural
swains
in
shady
homely
cottages
thou
hast
brought
me
to
a
grove
of
flowers
to
the
brink
of
purling
streams
where
thou
hast
laid
me
down
to
contemplate
on
to
think
my
tedious
hours
away
in
the
softest
imagination
a
soul
inspir
d
by
love
can
conceive
to
increase
my
passion
by
every
thing
i
behold
for
every
sound
that
meets
the
sense
is
thy
proper
music
oh
love
and
every
thing
inspires
thy
dictates
the
winds
around
me
blow
soft
and
mixing
with
wanton
boughs
continually
play
and
kiss
while
those
like
a
coy
maid
in
love
resist
and
comply
by
turns
they
like
a
ravish
d
vigorous
lover
rush
on
with
a
transported
violence
rudely
embracing
their
d
mistress
ruffling
her
native
order
while
the
pretty
birds
on
the
dancing
branches
incessantly
make
love
upbraiding
duller
man
with
his
defective
want
of
fire
man
the
lord
of
all
he
to
be
stinted
in
the
most
valuable
joy
of
life
is
it
not
pity
here
is
no
troublesome
honour
amongst
the
pretty
inhabitants
of
the
woods
and
streams
fondly
to
give
laws
to
nature
but
uncontrolled
they
play
and
sing
and
love
no
parents
checking
their
dear
delights
no
slavish
matrimonial
ties
to
restrain
their
nobler
flame
no
spies
to
interrupt
their
blest
appointments
but
every
little
nest
is
free
and
open
to
receive
the
young
fledg
d
lover
every
bough
is
conscious
of
their
passion
nor
do
the
generous
pair
languish
in
tedious
ceremony
but
meeting
look
and
like
and
love
embrace
with
their
wingy
arms
and
salute
with
their
little
opening
bills
this
is
their
courtship
this
the
amorous
compliment
and
this
only
the
introduction
to
all
their
following
happiness
and
thus
it
is
with
the
flocks
and
herds
while
scanted
man
born
alone
for
the
fatigues
of
love
with
industrious
toil
and
all
his
boasting
arts
of
eloquence
his
image
and
his
noble
form
may
labour
on
a
tedious
term
of
years
with
pain
expense
and
hazard
before
he
can
arrive
at
happiness
and
then
too
perhaps
his
vows
are
unregarded
and
all
his
sighs
and
tears
are
vain
tell
me
oh
you
ye
amorous
dear
brutes
tell
me
when
ever
you
lay
languishing
beneath
your
coverts
thus
for
your
fair
she
and
durst
not
approach
for
fear
of
honour
tell
me
by
a
gentle
bleat
ye
little
butting
rams
do
you
sigh
thus
for
your
soft
white
ewes
do
you
lie
thus
conceal
d
to
wait
the
coming
shades
of
night
all
the
cursed
spies
are
folded
no
no
even
you
are
much
more
blest
than
man
who
is
bound
up
to
rules
fetter
d
by
the
nice
decencies
of
honour
my
divine
maid
thus
were
my
thoughts
employ
d
when
from
the
farthest
end
of
the
grove
where
i
now
remain
i
saw
approach
with
thy
welcome
letter
he
tells
you
had
like
to
have
been
surpris
d
in
making
it
up
and
he
receiv
d
it
with
much
difficulty
ah
should
any
accident
happen
to
prevent
my
seeing
you
i
were
undone
for
ever
and
you
must
expect
to
find
me
stretch
d
out
dead
and
cold
under
this
oak
where
now
i
lie
writing
on
its
knotty
root
thy
letter
i
confess
is
dear
it
contains
thy
soul
and
my
happiness
by
this
of
the
surprise
i
long
to
be
inform
d
of
for
from
thence
i
may
gather
part
of
my
fortune
i
rave
and
die
with
fear
of
a
disappointment
not
but
i
would
undergo
a
thousand
torments
and
deaths
for
but
oh
consider
me
and
let
me
not
suffer
if
possible
for
know
my
charming
angel
my
impatient
heart
is
almost
broke
and
will
not
contain
itself
without
being
nearer
my
adorable
maid
without
taking
in
at
my
eyes
a
little
comfort
no
i
am
resolv
d
put
me
not
off
with
tricks
which
foolish
honour
invents
to
jilt
mankind
with
for
if
you
do
by
heaven
i
will
forget
all
considerations
and
respect
and
force
myself
with
all
the
violence
of
raging
love
into
the
presence
of
my
cruel
own
her
mine
and
ravish
my
delight
nor
shall
the
happy
walls
of
be
of
strength
sufficient
to
secure
her
nay
persuade
me
not
for
if
you
make
me
mad
and
raving
this
will
be
the
effects
on
oh
pardon
me
my
sacred
maid
pardon
the
wildness
of
my
frantic
love
i
paused
took
a
turn
or
two
in
the
lone
path
consider
d
what
i
had
said
and
found
it
was
too
much
too
bold
too
rude
to
approach
my
soft
my
tender
maid
i
am
calm
my
soul
as
thy
bewitching
smiles
hush
as
thy
secret
sighs
and
will
resolve
to
die
rather
than
offend
my
adorable
virgin
only
send
me
word
what
you
think
of
my
fate
while
i
expect
it
here
on
this
kind
mossy
bed
where
now
i
lie
which
i
would
not
quit
for
a
throne
since
here
i
may
hope
the
news
may
soonest
arrive
to
make
me
happier
than
a
god
which
that
nothing
on
my
part
may
prevent
i
here
vow
in
the
face
of
heaven
i
will
not
abuse
the
freedom
my
blesses
me
with
nor
shall
my
love
go
beyond
the
limits
of
honour
shall
command
with
a
frown
and
fetter
me
with
a
smile
prescribe
rules
to
my
longing
ravish
d
eyes
and
pinion
my
busy
fond
roving
hands
and
lay
at
her
feet
like
a
tame
slave
her
adoring
philander
philander
approach
approach
you
sacred
queen
of
night
and
bring
veil
d
from
all
eyes
but
mine
approach
at
a
fond
lover
s
call
behold
how
i
lie
panting
with
expectation
tir
d
out
with
your
tedious
ceremony
to
the
god
of
day
be
kind
oh
lovely
night
and
let
the
deity
descend
to
his
beloved
arms
and
i
to
my
the
sun
and
i
must
snatch
our
joys
in
the
same
happy
hours
favour
d
by
thee
oh
sacred
silent
night
see
see
the
enamour
d
sun
is
hasting
on
apace
to
his
expecting
mistress
while
thou
dull
night
art
slowly
lingering
yet
advance
my
friend
my
goddess
and
my
confidante
hide
all
my
blushes
all
my
soft
confusions
my
tremblings
transports
and
eyes
all
languishing
oh
a
thousand
things
i
have
done
to
divert
the
tedious
hours
but
nothing
can
all
things
are
dull
without
thee
i
am
tir
d
with
every
thing
impatient
to
end
as
soon
as
i
begin
them
even
the
shades
and
solitary
walks
afford
me
now
no
ease
no
satisfaction
and
thought
but
afflicts
me
more
that
us
d
to
relieve
and
i
at
last
have
recourse
to
my
kind
pen
for
while
i
write
methinks
i
am
talking
to
thee
i
tell
thee
thus
my
soul
while
thou
methinks
art
all
the
while
smiling
and
listening
by
this
is
much
easier
than
silent
thought
and
my
soul
is
never
weary
of
this
converse
and
thus
i
would
speak
a
thousand
things
but
that
still
methinks
words
do
not
enough
express
my
soul
to
understand
that
right
there
requires
looks
there
is
a
rhetoric
in
looks
in
sighs
and
silent
touches
that
surpasses
all
there
is
an
accent
in
the
sound
of
words
too
that
gives
a
sense
and
soft
meaning
to
little
things
which
of
themselves
are
of
trivial
value
and
insignificant
and
by
the
cadence
of
the
utterance
may
express
a
tenderness
which
their
own
meaning
does
not
bear
by
this
i
wou
d
insinuate
that
the
story
of
the
heart
can
not
be
so
well
told
by
this
way
as
by
presence
and
conversation
sure
understands
what
i
mean
by
this
which
possibly
is
nonsense
to
all
but
a
lover
who
apprehends
all
the
little
fond
prattle
of
the
thing
belov
d
and
finds
an
eloquence
in
it
that
to
a
sense
unconcern
d
would
appear
even
approaching
to
folly
but
who
has
the
true
notions
of
love
in
him
apprehends
all
that
can
be
said
on
that
dear
subject
to
him
i
venture
to
say
any
thing
whose
kind
and
soft
imaginations
can
supply
all
my
wants
in
the
description
of
the
soul
will
it
not
answer
me
but
oh
where
art
thou
i
see
thee
not
i
touch
thee
not
but
when
i
haste
with
transport
to
embrace
thee
tis
shadow
all
and
my
poor
arms
return
empty
to
my
bosom
why
oh
why
com
st
thou
not
why
art
thou
cautious
and
prudently
waitest
the
d
night
oh
cold
oh
unreasonable
lover
why
but
i
grow
wild
and
know
not
what
i
say
impatient
love
betrays
me
to
a
thousand
follies
a
thousand
rashnesses
i
die
with
shame
but
i
must
be
undone
and
it
is
no
matter
how
whether
by
my
own
weakness
charms
or
both
i
know
not
but
so
it
is
destin
d
oh
it
is
two
tedious
hours
love
has
counted
since
you
writ
to
me
yet
are
but
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
what
have
you
been
doing
all
that
while
are
you
not
unkind
does
not
lie
neglected
and
unregarded
in
your
thoughts
huddled
up
confusedly
with
your
graver
business
of
state
and
almost
lost
in
the
ambitious
crowd
say
say
my
lovely
charmer
is
she
not
does
not
this
fatal
interest
you
espouse
rival
your
is
she
not
too
often
remov
d
thence
to
let
in
that
haughty
tyrant
mistress
alas
i
more
than
fear
she
is
and
oh
my
adorable
lover
when
i
look
forward
on
our
coming
happiness
whenever
i
lay
by
the
thoughts
of
honour
and
give
a
loose
to
love
i
run
not
far
in
the
pleasing
career
before
that
dreadful
thought
stopp
d
me
on
my
way
i
have
a
fatal
prophetic
fear
that
gives
a
check
to
my
soft
pursuit
and
tells
me
that
thy
unhappy
engagement
in
this
league
this
accursed
association
will
one
day
undo
us
both
and
part
for
ever
thee
and
thy
unlucky
yes
yes
my
dear
lord
my
soul
does
presage
an
unfortunate
event
from
this
dire
engagement
nor
can
your
false
reasoning
your
fancied
advantages
reconcile
it
to
my
honest
d
heart
and
surely
the
design
is
inconsistent
with
love
for
two
such
mighty
contradictions
and
enemies
as
love
and
ambition
or
revenge
can
never
sure
abide
in
one
soul
together
at
least
love
can
but
share
heart
when
blood
and
revenge
which
he
miscalls
glory
rivals
it
and
has
possibly
the
greater
part
in
it
methinks
this
notion
enlarges
in
me
and
every
word
i
speak
and
every
minute
s
thought
of
it
strengthens
its
reason
to
me
and
give
me
leave
while
i
am
full
of
the
jealousy
of
it
to
express
my
sentiments
and
lay
before
you
those
reasons
that
love
and
i
think
most
substantial
ones
what
you
have
hitherto
desired
of
me
oh
unreasonable
and
what
i
out
of
modesty
and
honour
denied
i
have
reason
to
fear
from
the
absolute
conquest
you
have
made
of
my
heart
that
some
time
or
other
the
charming
thief
may
break
in
and
rob
me
of
for
fame
and
virtue
love
begins
to
laugh
at
my
dear
unfortunate
condition
being
thus
it
is
not
impossible
oh
but
i
may
one
day
in
some
unlucky
hour
in
some
soft
bewitching
moment
in
some
spiteful
critical
ravishing
minute
yield
all
to
the
charming
and
if
so
where
oh
where
is
my
security
that
i
shall
not
be
abandon
d
by
the
lovely
victor
for
it
is
not
your
vows
which
you
call
sacred
and
i
alas
believe
so
that
can
secure
me
though
i
heaven
knows
believe
them
all
and
am
undone
you
may
keep
them
all
too
and
i
believe
you
will
but
oh
in
these
fatal
circumstances
you
have
engag
d
yourself
can
you
secure
me
my
lover
your
protestations
you
may
but
not
the
dear
protestor
is
it
not
enough
oh
for
my
eternal
unquiet
and
undoing
to
know
that
you
are
married
and
can
not
therefore
be
entirely
mine
is
not
this
enough
oh
cruel
but
you
must
espouse
a
fatal
cause
too
more
pernicious
than
that
of
matrimony
and
more
destructive
to
my
repose
oh
give
me
leave
to
reason
with
you
and
since
you
have
been
pleas
d
to
trust
and
afflict
me
with
the
secret
which
honest
as
i
am
i
will
never
betray
yet
yet
give
me
leave
to
urge
the
danger
of
it
to
you
and
consequently
to
me
if
you
pursue
it
when
you
are
with
me
we
can
think
and
talk
and
argue
nothing
but
the
mightier
business
of
love
and
it
is
fit
that
i
so
fondly
and
fatally
lov
d
by
you
should
warn
you
of
the
danger
consider
my
lord
you
are
born
noble
from
parents
of
untainted
loyalty
blest
with
a
fortune
few
princes
beneath
sovereignty
are
masters
of
blest
with
youth
commanding
beauty
wit
courage
bravery
of
mind
and
all
that
renders
men
esteem
d
and
ador
d
what
would
you
more
what
is
it
oh
my
charming
brother
then
that
you
set
up
for
is
it
glory
oh
mistaken
lovely
youth
that
glory
is
but
a
glittering
light
that
flashes
for
a
moment
and
then
disappears
it
is
a
false
bravery
that
will
bring
an
eternal
blemish
upon
your
honest
fame
and
house
render
your
honourable
name
hated
detested
and
abominable
in
story
to
after
ages
a
traitor
the
worst
of
titles
the
most
inglorious
and
shameful
what
has
the
king
our
good
our
gracious
monarch
done
to
how
disoblig
d
him
or
indeed
what
injury
to
mankind
who
has
he
oppress
d
where
play
d
the
tyrant
or
the
ravisher
what
one
cruel
or
angry
thing
has
he
committed
in
all
the
time
of
his
fortunate
and
peaceable
reign
over
us
whose
ox
or
whose
ass
has
he
unjustly
taken
what
orphan
wrong
d
or
widow
s
tears
neglected
but
all
his
life
has
been
one
continued
miracle
all
good
all
gracious
calm
and
merciful
and
this
good
this
king
is
mark
d
out
for
slaughter
design
d
a
sacrifice
to
the
private
revenge
of
a
few
ambitious
knaves
and
rebels
whose
pretence
is
the
public
good
and
doomed
to
be
basely
murdered
a
murder
even
on
the
worst
of
criminals
carries
with
it
a
cowardice
so
black
and
infamous
as
the
most
abject
wretches
the
meanest
spirited
creature
has
an
abhorrence
for
what
to
murder
a
man
unthinking
unwarn
d
unprepar
d
and
undefended
oh
barbarous
oh
poor
and
most
unbrave
what
villain
is
there
lost
to
all
humanity
to
be
found
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
that
when
done
dare
own
so
hellish
a
deed
as
the
murder
of
the
meanest
of
his
fellow
subjects
much
less
the
sacred
person
of
the
king
the
lord
s
anointed
on
whose
awful
face
tis
impossible
to
look
without
that
reverence
wherewith
one
would
behold
a
god
for
tis
most
certain
that
every
glance
from
his
piercing
wondrous
eyes
begets
a
trembling
adoration
for
my
part
i
swear
to
you
i
never
approach
his
sacred
person
but
my
heart
beats
my
blood
runs
cold
about
me
and
my
eyes
overflow
with
tears
of
joy
while
an
awful
confusion
seizes
me
all
over
and
i
am
certain
should
the
most
harden
d
of
your
bloody
rebels
look
him
in
the
face
the
devilish
instrument
of
death
would
drop
from
his
sacrilegious
hand
and
leave
him
confounded
at
the
feet
of
the
royal
forgiving
sufferer
his
eyes
have
in
them
something
so
fierce
so
majestic
commanding
and
yet
so
good
and
merciful
as
would
soften
rebellion
itself
into
repenting
loyalty
and
like
seem
to
say
who
is
it
dares
hurt
the
king
they
alone
like
his
guardian
angels
defend
his
sacred
person
oh
what
pity
it
is
unhappy
young
man
thy
education
was
not
near
the
king
plain
tis
reasonable
tis
honest
great
and
glorious
to
believe
what
thy
own
sense
if
thou
wilt
but
think
and
consider
will
instruct
thee
in
that
treason
rebellion
and
murder
are
far
from
the
paths
that
lead
to
glory
which
are
as
distant
as
hell
from
heaven
what
is
it
then
to
advance
since
i
say
tis
plain
glory
is
never
this
way
to
be
achiev
d
is
it
to
add
more
thousands
to
those
fortune
has
already
so
lavishly
bestow
d
on
you
oh
my
that
s
to
double
the
vast
crime
which
reaches
already
to
damnation
would
your
honour
your
conscience
your
christianity
or
common
humanity
suffer
you
to
enlarge
your
fortunes
at
the
price
of
another
s
ruin
and
make
the
spoils
of
some
honest
noble
unfortunate
family
the
rewards
of
your
treachery
would
you
build
your
fame
on
such
a
foundation
perhaps
on
the
destruction
of
some
friend
or
kinsman
oh
barbarous
and
mistaken
greatness
thieves
and
robbers
would
scorn
such
outrages
that
had
but
souls
and
sense
is
it
for
addition
of
titles
what
elevation
can
you
have
much
greater
than
where
you
now
stand
fix
d
if
you
do
not
grow
giddy
with
your
fancied
false
hopes
and
fall
from
that
glorious
height
you
are
already
arrived
to
and
which
with
the
honest
addition
of
loyalty
is
of
far
more
value
and
lustre
than
to
arrive
at
crowns
by
blood
and
treason
this
will
last
to
ages
last
while
t
other
will
be
ridicul
d
to
all
posterity
short
liv
d
and
reproachful
here
infamous
and
accursed
to
all
eternity
is
it
to
make
king
oh
what
is
to
my
if
a
monarchy
you
design
then
why
not
this
king
this
great
this
good
this
royal
forgiver
this
who
was
born
a
king
and
born
your
king
and
holds
his
crown
by
right
of
nature
by
right
of
law
by
right
of
heaven
itself
heaven
who
has
preserved
him
and
confirmed
him
ours
by
a
thousand
miraculous
escapes
and
sufferings
and
indulged
him
ours
by
ten
thousand
acts
of
mercy
and
endeared
him
to
us
by
his
wondrous
care
and
conduct
by
securing
of
peace
plenty
ease

luxurious
happiness
over
all
the
fortunate
limits

his
blessed
kingdoms
and
will
you
would
you
destroy
this
wondrous
gift
of
heaven
this
king
this
real
good
we
now
possess
for
a
most
uncertain
one
and
with
it
the
repose
of
all
the
happy
nation
to
establish
a
king
without
law
without
right
without
consent
without
title
and
indeed
without
even
competent
parts
for
so
vast
a
trust
or
so
glorious
a
rule
one
who
never
oblig
d
the
nation
by
one
single
act
of
goodness
or
valour
in
all
the
course
of
his
life
and
who
never
signaliz
d
himself
to
the
advantage
of
one
man
of
all
the
kingdom
a
prince
unfortunate
in
his
principles
and
morals
and
whose
sole
single
ingratitude
to
his
majesty
for
so
many
royal
bounties
honours
and
glories
heap
d
upon
him
is
of
itself
enough
to
set
any
honest
generous
heart
against
him
what
is
it
bewitches
you
so
is
it
his
beauty
then
has
a
greater
title
than
and
not
one
other
merit
has
he
since
in
piety
chastity
sobriety
charity
and
honour
he
as
little
excels
as
in
gratitude
obedience
and
loyalty
what
then
my
dear
is
it
his
weakness
ah
there
s
the
argument
you
all
propose
and
think
to
govern
so
soft
a
king
but
believe
me
oh
unhappy
nothing
is
more
ungovernable
than
a
fool
nothing
more
obstinate
wilful
conceited
and
cunning
and
for
his
gratitude
let
the
world
judge
what
he
must
prove
to
his
servants
who
has
dealt
so
ill
with
his
lord
and
master
how
he
must
reward
those
that
present
him
with
a
crown
who
deals
so
ungraciously
with
him
who
gave
him
life
and
who
set
him
up
an
happier
object
than
a
monarch
no
no
he
that
can
cabal
and
contrive
to
dethrone
a
father
will
find
it
easy
to
discard
the
wicked
and
hated
instruments
that
assisted
him
to
mount
it
decline
him
then
oh
fond
and
deluded
decline
him
early
for
you
of
all
the
rest
ought
to
do
so
and
not
to
set
a
helping
hand
to
load
him
with
honours
that
chose
you
out
from
all
the
world
to
load
with
infamy
remember
that
remember
and
then
renounce
him
do
not
you
contribute
to
the
adorning
of
his
unfit
head
with
a
diadem
the
most
glorious
of
ornaments
who
unadorned
yours
with
the
most
inglorious
of
all
reproaches
think
of
this
oh
thou
unconsidering
noble
youth
lay
thy
hand
upon
thy
generous
heart
and
tell
it
all
the
fears
all
the
reasonings
of
her
that
loves
thee
more
than
life
a
thousand
arguments
i
could
bring
but
these
few
unstudied
falling
in
amongst
my
softer
thoughts
i
beg
you
will
accept
of
till
i
can
more
at
large
deliver
the
glorious
argument
to
your
soul
let
this
suffice
to
tell
thee
that
like
i
rave
and
prophesy
in
vain
this
association
will
be
the
eternal
ruin
of
for
let
it
succeed
or
not
either
way
thou
art
undone
if
thou
pursuest
it
i
must
infallibly
fall
with
thee
if
i
resolve
to
follow
thy
good
or
ill
fortune
for
you
can
not
intend
love
and
ambition
and
at
once
no
persuade
me
not
the
title
to
one
or
t
other
must
be
laid
down
or
must
be
abandon
d
this
is
my
fix
d
resolve
if
thy
too
powerful
arguments
convince
not
in
spite
of
reason
for
they
can
do
it
thou
hast
the
tongue
of
an
angel
and
the
eloquence
of
a
god
and
while
i
listen
to
thy
voice
i
take
all
thou
say
st
for
wondrous
farewell
about
two
hours
hence
i
shall
expect
you
at
the
gate
that
leads
into
the
garden
grove
adieu
remember
sylvia
sylvia
how
comes
my
charming
so
skilled
in
the
mysteries
of
state
where
learnt
her
tender
heart
the
notions
of
rigid
business
where
her
soft
tongue
formed
only
for
the
dear
language
of
love
to
talk
of
the
concerns
of
nations
and
kingdoms
tis
true
when
i
gave
my
soul
away
to
my
dear
counsellor
i
reserved
nothing
to
myself
not
even
that
secret
that
so
concerned
my
life
but
laid
all
at
her
mercy
my
generous
heart
could
not
love
at
a
less
rate
than
to
lavish
all
and
be
undone
for
tis
glorious
ruin
and
it
pleases
me
if
it
advance
one
single
joy
or
add
one
demonstration
of
my
love
to
tis
not
enough
that
we
tell
those
we
love
all
they
love
to
hear
but
one
ought
to
tell
them
too
every
secret
that
we
know
and
conceal
no
part
of
that
heart
one
has
made
a
present
of
to
the
person
one
loves
tis
a
treason
in
love
not
to
be
pardoned
i
am
sensible
that
when
my
story
is
told
and
this
happy
one
of
my
love
shall
make
up
the
greatest
part
of
my
history
those
that
love
not
like
me
will
be
apt
to
blame
me
and
charge
me
with
weakness
for
revealing
so
great
a
trust
to
a
woman
and
amongst
all
that
i
shall
do
to
arrive
at
glory
that
will
brand
me
with
feebleness
but
when
lovers
shall
read
it
the
men
will
excuse
me
and
the
maids
bless
me
i
shall
be
a
fond
admired
precedent
for
them
to
point
out
to
their
remiss
reserving
lovers
who
will
be
reproached
for
not
pursuing
my
example
i
know
not
what
opinion
men
generally
have
of
the
weakness
of
women
but
tis
sure
a
vulgar
error
for
were
they
like
my
adorable
had
they
had
her
wit
her
vivacity
of
spirit
her
courage
her
generous
fortitude
her
command
in
every
graceful
look
and
action
they
were
most
certainly
fit
to
rule
and
reign
and
man
was
only
born
robust
and
strong
to
secure
them
on
those
thrones
they
are
formed
by
beauty
softness
and
a
thousand
charms
which
men
want
to
possess
glorious
woman
was
born
for
command
and
dominion
and
though
custom
has
usurped
us
the
name
of
rule
over
all
we
from
the
beginning
found
ourselves
in
spite
of
all
our
boasted
prerogative
slaves
and
vassals
to
the
almighty
sex
take
then
my
share
of
empire
ye
gods
and
give
me
love
let
me
toil
to
gain
but
let
triumph
and
reign
i
ask
no
more
than
the
led
slave
at
her
chariot
wheels
to
gaze
on
my
charming
conqueress
and
wear
with
joy
her
fetters
oh
how
proud
i
should
be
to
see
the
dear
victor
of
my
soul
so
elevated
so
adorn
d
with
crowns
and
sceptres
at
her
feet
which
i
had
won
to
see
her
smiling
on
the
adoring
crowd
distributing
her
glories
to
young
waiting
princes
there
dealing
provinces
and
there
a
coronet
heavens
methinks
i
see
the
lovely
virgin
in
this
state
her
chariot
slowly
driving
through
the
multitude
that
press
to
gaze
upon
her
she
dress
d
like
richly
gay
and
loose
her
hair
and
robe
blown
by
the
flying
winds
discovering
a
thousand
charms
to
view
thus
the
young
goddess
looked
then
when
she
drove
her
chariot
down
descending
clouds
to
meet
the
gods
in
cooling
shades
and
so
would
look
my
ah
my
soft
lovely
maid
such
thoughts
as
these
fir
d
me
with
ambition
for
me
i
swear
by
every
power
that
made
me
love
and
made
thee
wondrous
fair
i
design
no
more
by
this
great
enterprise
than
to
make
thee
some
glorious
thing
elevated
above
what
we
have
seen
yet
on
earth
to
raise
thee
above
fate
or
fortune
beyond
that
pity
of
thy
duller
sex
who
understand
not
thy
soul
nor
can
ever
reach
the
flights
of
thy
generous
love
no
my
soul
s
joy
i
must
not
leave
thee
liable
to
their
little
natural
malice
and
scorn
to
the
impertinence
of
their
reproaches
no
my
i
must
on
the
great
design
must
move
forward
though
i
abandon
it
twill
advance
it
is
already
too
far
to
put
a
stop
to
it
and
now
i
am
entered
it
is
in
vain
to
retreat
if
we
are
prosperous
it
will
to
all
ages
be
called
a
glorious
enterprise
but
if
we
fail
it
will
be
base
horrid
and
infamous
for
the
world
judges
of
nothing
but
by
the
success
that
cause
is
always
good
that
is
prosperous
that
is
ill
which
is
unsuccessful
should
i
now
retreat
i
run
many
hazards
but
to
go
on
i
run
but
one
by
the
first
i
shall
alarm
the
whole
cabal
with
a
jealousy
of
my
discovering
and
those
are
persons
of
too
great
sense
and
courage
not
to
take
some
private
way
of
revenge
to
secure
their
own
stakes
and
to
make
myself
uncertainly
safe
by
a
discovery
indeed
were
to
gain
a
refuge
so
ignoble
as
a
man
of
honour
would
scorn
to
purchase
life
at
nor
would
that
baseness
secure
me
but
in
going
on
oh
when
three
kingdoms
shall
lie
unpossess
d
and
be
exposed
as
it
were
amongst
the
raffling
crowd
who
knows
but
the
chance
may
be
mine
as
well
as
any
other
s
who
has
but
the
same
hazard
and
throw
for
it
if
the
strongest
sword
must
do
it
as
that
must
do
it
why
not
mine
still
why
may
not
mine
be
that
fortunate
one
has
no
more
right
to
it
than
tis
true
a
few
of
the
rabble
will
pretend
he
has
a
better
title
to
it
but
they
are
a
sort
of
easy
fools
lavish
in
nothing
but
noise
and
nonsense
true
to
change
and
inconstancy
and
will
abandon
him
to
their
own
fury
for
the
next
that
cries
haloo
neither
is
there
one
part
of
fifty
of
the
fools
that
cry
him
up
for
his
interest
though
they
use
him
for
a
tool
to
work
with
he
being
the
only
great
man
that
wants
sense
enough
to
find
out
the
cheat
which
they
dare
impose
upon
can
any
body
of
reason
believe
if
they
had
design
d
him
good
they
would
let
him
d
have
own
d
a
party
so
opposite
to
all
laws
of
nature
religion
humanity
and
common
gratitude
when
his
interest
if
design
d
might
have
been
carried
on
better
if
he
had
still
dissembled
and
stay
d
in
court
no
believe
me
the
politicians
shew
him
to
render
him
odious
to
all
men
of
tolerable
sense
of
the
party
for
what
reason
soever
they
have
who
are
disoblig
d
or
at
least
think
themselves
so
to
set
up
for
liberty
the
world
knows
renders
himself
the
worst
of
criminals
by
it
and
has
abandon
d
an
interest
more
glorious
and
easy
than
empire
to
side
with
and
aid
people
that
never
did
or
ever
can
oblige
him
and
he
is
so
dull
as
to
imagine
that
for
his
sake
who
never
did
us
service
or
good
unless
cuckolding
us
be
good
we
should
venture
life
and
fame
to
pull
down
a
true
monarch
to
set
up
his
bastard
over
us
must
pardon
me
if
i
think
his
politics
are
shallow
as
his
parts
and
that
his
own
interest
has
undone
him
for
of
what
advantage
soever
the
design
may
be
to
us
it
really
shocks
one
s
nature
to
find
a
son
engag
d
against
a
father
and
to
him
such
a
father
nor
when
time
comes
shall
i
forget
the
ruin
of
but
let
him
hope
on
and
so
will
i
as
do
a
thousand
more
for
ought
i
know
i
set
out
as
fair
as
they
and
will
start
as
eagerly
if
i
miss
it
now
i
have
youth
and
vigour
sufficient
for
another
race
and
while
i
stand
on
fortune
s
wheel
as
she
rolls
it
round
it
may
be
my
turn
to
be
o
th
top
for
when
tis
set
in
motion
believe
me
it
is
not
easily
fix
d
however
let
it
suffice
i
am
now
in
past
a
retreat
and
to
urge
it
now
to
me
is
but
to
put
me
into
inevitable
danger
at
best
it
can
but
set
me
where
i
was
that
is
worse
than
death
when
every
fool
is
aiming
at
a
kingdom
what
man
of
tolerable
pride
and
ambition
can
be
unconcerned
and
not
put
himself
into
a
posture
of
catching
when
a
diadem
shall
be
thrown
among
the
crowd
it
were
insensibility
stupid
dullness
not
to
lift
a
hand
or
make
an
effort
to
snatch
it
as
it
flies
though
the
glorious
falling
weight
should
crush
me
it
is
great
to
attempt
and
if
fortune
do
not
favour
fools
i
have
as
fair
a
grasp
for
it
as
any
other
adventurer
this
my
is
my
sense
of
a
business
you
so
much
dread
i
may
rise
but
i
can
not
fall
therefore
my
urge
it
no
more
love
gave
me
ambition
and
do
not
divert
the
glorious
effects
of
your
wondrous
charms
but
let
them
grow
and
spread
and
see
what
they
will
produce
for
my
lovely
the
advantages
will
most
certainly
be
hers
but
no
more
how
came
my
love
so
dull
to
entertain
thee
so
many
minutes
thus
with
reasons
for
an
affair
which
one
soft
hour
with
will
convince
to
what
she
would
have
it
believe
me
it
will
i
will
sacrifice
all
to
her
repose
nay
to
her
least
command
even
the
life
of
my
eternal
pleasure
philander
have
no
longer
patience
i
must
be
coming
towards
the
grove
though
it
will
do
me
no
good
more
than
knowing
i
am
so
much
nearer
to
my
adorable
conjure
you
burn
this
for
writing
in
haste
i
have
not
counterfeited
my
sylvia
in
a
pair
of
my
charmer
i
wait
your
commands
in
the
meadow
behind
the
grove
where
i
saw
his
daughter
entering
with
a
basket
of
cowslips
for
unnecessarily
offering
sweets
to
the
goddess
of
the
groves
from
whence
they
with
all
the
rest
of
their
gaudy
fellows
of
the
spring
assume
their
ravishing
odours
i
take
every
opportunity
of
telling
my
what
i
have
so
often
repeated
and
shall
be
ever
repeating
with
the
same
joy
while
i
live
that
i
love
my
to
death
and
madness
that
my
soul
is
on
the
rack
till
she
send
me
the
happy
advancing
word
and
yet
believe
me
lovely
maid
i
could
grow
old
with
waiting
here
the
blessed
moment
though
set
at
any
distance
within
the
compass
of
life
and
impossible
to
be
till
then
arriv
d
to
but
when
i
am
so
near
approach
d
it
love
from
all
parts
rallies
and
hastens
to
my
heart
for
the
mighty
encounter
till
the
poor
panting
victim
dies
with
the
pressing
weight
no
more
you
know
it
for
it
is
and
will
be
eternally
postscript
my
adorable
it
is
now
seven
o
clock
i
have
my
watch
in
my
hand
waiting
and
looking
on
the
slow
pac
d
minutes
eight
will
quickly
arrive
i
hope
and
then
it
is
dark
enough
to
hide
me
think
where
i
am
and
who
i
am
waiting
sylvia
and
her
philander
think
my
dear
angel
you
have
the
other
key
of
these
tablets
if
not
they
are
easily
broke
open
you
have
an
hour
good
to
write
in
sylvia
i
shall
wait
unemployed
by
any
thing
but
thought
send
me
word
how
you
were
like
to
have
been
surpris
d
it
may
possibly
be
of
advantage
to
me
in
this
night
s
dear
adventure
i
wonder
d
at
the
superscription
of
my
letter
indeed
of
dorillus
give
me
no
other
account
than
that
you
were
surpris
d
and
he
receiv
d
it
with
difficulty
give
me
the
story
now
do
it
in
charity
my
angel
besides
i
would
employ
all
thy
moments
for
i
am
jealous
of
every
one
that
is
not
dedicated
sylvia
s
philander
philander
i
have
received
your
tablets
of
which
i
have
the
key
and
heaven
only
knows
for
lovers
can
not
unless
they
loved
like
and
her
what
pains
and
pantings
my
heart
sustain
d
at
every
thought
they
brought
me
of
thy
near
approach
every
moment
i
start
and
am
ready
to
faint
with
joy
fear
and
something
not
to
be
express
d
that
seizes
me
to
add
to
this
i
have
busied
myself
with
dressing
my
apartment
up
with
flowers
so
that
i
fancy
the
ceremonious
business
of
the
light
looks
like
the
preparations
for
the
dear
joy
of
the
nuptial
bed
that
too
is
so
adorn
d
and
deck
d
with
all
that
s
sweet
and
gay
all
which
possesses
me
with
so
ravishing
and
solemn
a
confusion
that
it
is
even
approaching
to
the
most
profound
sadness
itself
oh
i
find
i
am
fond
of
being
undone
and
unless
you
take
a
more
than
mortal
care
of
me
i
know
this
night
some
fatal
mischief
will
befall
me
what
it
is
i
know
not
either
the
loss
of
my
life
or
my
honour
or
all
together
which
a
discovery
only
of
your
being
alone
in
my
apartment
and
at
such
an
hour
will
most
certainly
draw
upon
us
death
is
the
least
we
must
expect
by
some
surprise
or
other
my
father
being
rash
and
extremely
jealous
and
the
more
so
of
me
by
how
much
more
he
is
fond
of
me
and
nothing
would
enrage
him
like
the
discovery
of
an
interview
like
this
though
you
have
liberty
to
range
the
house
of
as
a
son
and
are
indeed
at
home
there
but
when
you
come
by
stealth
when
he
shall
find
his
son
and
virgin
daughter
the
brother
and
the
sister
so
retired
so
entertained
what
but
death
can
ensue
or
what
is
worse
eternal
shame
eternal
confusion
on
my
honour
what
excuse
what
evasions
vows
and
protestations
will
convince
him
or
appease
jealousy
my
sister
and
wife
oh
god
that
cruel
thought
will
put
me
into
ravings
i
have
a
thousand
streams
of
killing
reflections
which
flow
from
that
original
fountain
curse
on
the
alliance
that
gave
you
a
welcome
to
ah
could
you
not
have
stay
d
ten
short
years
longer
alas
you
thought
that
was
an
age
in
youth
but
it
is
but
a
day
in
love
ah
could
not
your
eager
youth
have
led
you
to
a
thousand
diversions
a
thousand
times
have
baited
in
the
long
journey
of
life
without
hurrying
on
to
the
last
stage
to
the
last
retreat
but
the
grave
and
to
me
seem
as
irrecoverable
as
impossible
to
retrieve
thee
could
no
kind
beauty
stop
thee
on
thy
way
in
charity
or
pity
saw
me
then
and
though
was
more
fit
for
his
caresses
and
i
but
capable
to
please
with
childish
prattle
oh
could
he
not
have
seen
a
promising
bloom
in
my
face
that
might
have
foretold
the
future
conquests
i
was
born
to
make
oh
was
there
no
prophetic
charm
that
could
bespeak
your
heart
engage
it
and
prevent
that
fatal
marriage
you
say
my
adorable
brother
we
were
destined
from
our
creation
for
one
another
that
the
decrees
of
heaven
or
fate
or
both
design
d
us
for
this
mutual
passion
why
then
oh
why
did
not
heaven
fate
or
destiny
do
the
mighty
work
when
first
you
saw
my
infant
charms
but
oh
why
do
i
vainly
rave
why
call
in
vain
on
time
that
s
fled
and
gone
why
idly
wish
for
ten
years
retribution
that
will
not
yield
a
day
an
hour
a
minute
no
no
tis
past
tis
past
and
flown
for
ever
as
distant
as
a
thousand
years
to
me
as
irrecoverable
oh
what
hast
thou
thrown
away
ten
glorious
years
of
ravishing
youth
of
unmatch
d
heavenly
beauty
on
one
that
knew
not
half
the
value
of
it
was
only
born
to
set
a
rate
upon
it
was
only
capable
of
love
such
love
as
might
deserve
it
oh
why
was
that
charming
face
ever
laid
on
any
bosom
that
knew
not
how
to
sigh
and
pant
and
heave
at
every
touch
of
so
much
distracting
beauty
oh
why
were
those
dear
arms
whose
soft
pressings
ravish
where
they
circle
destin
d
for
a
body
cold
and
dull
that
could
sleep
insensibly
there
and
not
so
much
as
dream
the
while
what
the
transporting
pleasure
signified
but
unconcerned
receive
the
wondrous
blessing
and
never
knew
its
price
or
thank
d
her
stars
she
has
thee
all
the
day
to
gaze
upon
and
yet
she
lets
thee
pass
her
careless
sight
as
if
there
were
no
miracles
in
view
she
does
not
see
the
little
gods
of
love
that
play
eternally
in
thy
eyes
and
since
she
never
received
a
dart
from
thence
believes
there
s
no
artillery
there
she
plays
not
with
thy
hair
nor
weaves
her
snowy
fingers
in
the
curls
of
jet
sets
it
in
order
and
adores
its
beauty
the
fool
with
had
done
as
well
for
her
a
dull
white
coxcomb
had
made
as
good
a
property
a
husband
is
no
more
at
best
no
more
oh
thou
charming
object
of
my
eternal
wishes
why
wert
thou
thus
dispos
d
oh
save
my
life
and
tell
me
what
indifferent
impulse
obliged
thee
to
these
nuptials
had
been
recommended
or
forc
d
by
the
tyranny
of
a
father
into
thy
arms
or
for
base
lucre
thou
hadst
chosen
her
this
had
excus
d
thy
youth
and
crime
obedience
or
vanity
i
could
have
pardon
d
but
oh
twas
love
love
my
thy
raving
love
and
that
which
has
undone
thee
was
a
rape
rather
than
marriage
you
fled
with
her
oh
heavens
mad
to
possess
you
stole
the
unloving
prize
yes
you
lov
d
her
false
as
you
are
you
did
perjur
d
and
faithless
lov
d
her
hell
and
confusion
on
the
word
it
was
so
oh
i
am
lost
letter
was
found
torn
in
monsieur
the
count
of
these
pieces
of
paper
which
i
have
put
together
as
well
as
i
could
were
writ
by
my
lady
to
have
been
sent
by
when
on
a
sudden
she
rose
in
rage
from
her
seat
tore
first
the
paper
and
then
her
robes
and
hair
and
indeed
nothing
has
escaped
the
violence
of
her
passion
nor
could
my
prayers
or
tears
retrieve
them
or
calm
her
tis
however
chang
d
at
last
to
mighty
passions
of
weeping
in
which
employment
i
have
left
her
on
her
repose
being
commanded
away
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
give
your
lordship
this
account
and
to
send
the
pieces
of
paper
that
your
lordship
may
guess
at
the
occasion
of
the
sudden
storm
which
ever
rises
in
that
fatal
quarter
but
in
putting
them
in
order
i
had
like
to
have
been
surprised
by
my
lady
s
father
for
my
lord
the
count
having
long
solicited
me
for
favours
and
taking
all
opportunities
of
entertaining
me
found
me
alone
in
my
chamber
employ
d
in
serving
your
lordship
i
had
only
time
to
hide
the
papers
and
to
get
rid
of
him
having
given
him
an
assignation
in
the
garden
grove
to
give
him
the
hearing
to
what
he
says
he
has
to
propose
to
me
pray
heaven
all
things
go
right
to
your
lordship
s
wish
this
evening
for
many
ominous
things
happen
d
madam
the
countess
had
like
to
have
taken
a
letter
writ
for
your
lordship
for
the
duchess
of
coming
to
make
her
a
visit
came
on
a
sudden
with
her
into
my
lady
s
apartment
and
surpris
d
her
writing
in
her
dressing
room
giving
her
only
time
to
slip
the
paper
into
her
combbox
the
first
ceremonies
being
pass
d
as
madam
the
duchess
uses
not
much
she
fell
to
commend
my
lady
s
and
taking
up
the
box
and
opening
it
found
the
letter
and
laughing
cried
oh
have
i
found
you
making
love
at
which
my
lady
with
an
infinite
confusion
would
have
retrieved
it
but
the
duchess
not
quitting
her
hold
cried
nay
i
am
resolved
to
see
in
what
manner
you
write
to
a
lover
and
whether
you
have
a
heart
tender
or
cruel
at
which
she
began
to
read
aloud
my
lady
to
blush
and
change
colour
a
hundred
times
in
a
minute
i
ready
to
die
with
fear
madam
the
countess
in
infinite
amazement
my
lady
interrupting
every
word
the
duchess
read
by
prayers
and
entreaties
which
heightened
her
curiosity
and
being
young
and
airy
regarded
not
the
indecency
to
which
she
preferr
d
her
curiosity
who
still
laughing
cried
she
was
resolv
d
to
read
it
out
and
know
the
constitution
of
her
heart
when
my
lady
whose
wit
never
fail
d
her
cried
i
beseech
you
madam
let
us
have
so
much
complaisance
for
as
to
ask
her
consent
in
this
affair
and
then
i
am
pleas
d
you
should
see
what
love
i
can
make
upon
occasion
i
took
the
hint
and
with
a
real
confusion
cried
i
implore
you
madam
not
to
discover
my
weakness
to
madam
the
duchess
i
would
not
for
the
world
be
thought
to
love
so
passionately
as
your
ladyship
in
favour
of
has
made
me
profess
under
the
name
of
to
this
encouraged
my
lady
who
began
to
say
a
thousand
pleasant
things
of
his
son
and
my
lover
as
your
lordship
knows
and
who
is
no
inconsiderable
fortune
for
a
maid
enrich
d
only
by
your
lordship
s
bounty
my
lady
after
this
took
the
letter
and
all
being
resolv
d
it
should
be
read
she
herself
did
it
and
turned
it
so
prettily
into
burlesque
love
by
her
manner
of
reading
it
that
made
madam
the
duchess
laugh
extremely
who
at
the
end
of
it
cried
to
my
lady
well
madam
i
am
satisfied
you
have
not
a
heart
wholly
insensible
of
love
that
could
so
express
it
for
thus
they
rallied
on
till
careful
of
my
lover
s
repose
the
duchess
urg
d
the
letter
might
be
immediately
sent
away
at
which
my
lady
readily
folding
up
the
letter
writ
the
alexis
on
the
outside
i
took
it
and
begg
d
i
might
have
leave
to
retire
to
write
it
over
in
my
own
hand
they
permitted
me
and
i
carried
it
after
sealing
it
to
who
waited
for
it
and
wondering
to
find
his
son
s
name
on
it
cried
mistress
i
doubt
you
have
mistook
my
present
business
i
wait
for
a
letter
from
my
lady
to
my
lord
and
you
give
me
one
from
yourself
to
my
son
twill
be
very
welcome
to
i
confess
but
at
this
time
i
had
rather
oblige
my
lord
than
my
son
i
laughing
replied
he
was
mistaken
that
at
this
time
meant
no
other
than
my
lord
which
pleas
d
the
good
man
extremely
who
thought
it
a
good
omen
for
his
son
and
so
went
his
way
satisfied
as
every
body
was
except
the
countess
who
fancied
something
more
in
it
than
my
lady
s
inditing
for
me
and
after
madam
the
duchess
was
gone
she
went
ruminating
and
pensive
to
her
chamber
from
whence
i
am
confident
she
will
not
depart
and
will
possibly
set
spies
in
every
corner
at
least
tis
good
to
fear
the
worst
that
we
may
prevent
all
things
that
would
hinder
this
night
s
assignation
as
soon
as
the
coast
is
clear
i
ll
wait
on
your
lordship
and
be
your
conductor
and
in
all
things
else
am
ready
to
shew
myself
lord
lordship
s
most
humble
and
most
obedient
servant
melinda
sylvia
given
orders
to
wait
on
your
lordship
as
soon
as
all
is
melinda
oh
what
have
you
told
me
stay
me
with
an
immediate
account
of
the
recovery
and
calmness
of
my
adorable
weeping
or
i
shall
enter
with
my
sword
drawn
bearing
down
all
before
me
till
i
make
my
way
to
my
charming
mourner
o
god
in
a
rage
in
any
passion
but
that
of
love
i
can
not
bear
it
no
by
heaven
i
can
not
i
shall
do
some
outrage
either
on
myself
or
at
oh
thou
dear
advocate
of
my
tenderest
wishes
thou
confidante
of
my
never
dying
flame
thou
kind
administering
maid
send
some
relief
to
my
breaking
heart
haste
and
tell
me
is
calm
that
her
bright
eyes
sparkle
with
smiles
or
if
they
languish
say
with
love
with
expecting
joys
that
her
dear
hands
are
no
more
employed
in
exercises
too
rough
and
unbecoming
their
native
softness
o
eternal
god
tearing
perhaps
her
divine
hair
brighter
than
the
sun
s
reflecting
beams
injuring
the
heavenly
beauty
of
her
charming
face
and
bosom
the
joy
and
wish
of
all
mankind
that
look
upon
her
oh
charm
her
with
prayers
and
tears
stop
her
dear
fingers
from
the
rude
assaults
bind
her
fair
hands
repeat
to
her
tell
her
he
s
fainting
with
the
news
of
her
unkindness
and
outrage
on
her
lovely
self
but
tell
her
too
i
die
adoring
her
tell
her
i
rave
i
tear
i
curse
myself
for
so
i
do
tell
her
i
would
break
out
into
a
violence
that
should
set
all
in
a
flame
but
for
my
care
of
her
heaven
and
earth
should
not
restrain
me
no
they
should
not
but
her
least
frown
should
still
me
tame
me
and
make
me
a
calm
coward
say
this
say
all
say
any
thing
to
charm
her
rage
and
tears
oh
i
am
mad
and
ready
to
run
on
business
i
die
to
think
her
guilty
of
tell
her
how
it
would
grieve
her
to
see
me
torn
and
mangled
to
see
that
hair
she
loves
ruffled
and
diminish
d
by
rage
violated
by
my
insupportable
grief
myself
quite
bereft
of
all
sense
but
that
of
love
but
that
of
adoration
for
my
charming
cruel
insensible
who
is
possessed
with
every
thought
with
every
imagination
that
can
render
me
unhappy
borne
away
with
every
fancy
that
is
in
disfavour
of
the
wretched
oh
write
immediately
or
you
will
behold
me
enter
a
most
deplorable
object
of
pity
when
i
receiv
d
yours
i
fell
into
such
a
passion
that
i
forc
d
myself
back
to
his
house
left
my
transports
and
hurried
me
to
where
i
should
have
undone
all
but
as
i
can
now
rest
no
where
i
am
now
returning
to
the
meadow
again
where
i
will
expect
your
aid
or
die
dorillus
cottage
almost
nine
o
philander
i
must
own
my
charming
that
my
love
is
now
arrived
to
that
excess
that
every
thought
which
before
but
discompos
d
me
now
puts
me
into
a
violence
of
rage
unbecoming
my
sex
or
any
thing
but
the
mighty
occasion
of
it
love
and
which
only
had
power
to
calm
what
it
had
before
ruffled
into
a
destructive
storm
but
like
the
anger
d
sea
which
pants
and
heaves
and
retains
still
an
uneasy
motion
long
after
the
rude
winds
are
appeas
d
and
hush
d
to
silence
my
heart
beats
still
and
heaves
with
the
sensible
remains
of
the
late
dangerous
tempest
of
my
mind
and
nothing
can
absolutely
calm
me
but
the
approach
of
the
though
that
thought
possesses
me
with
ten
thousand
fears
which
i
know
will
vanish
all
at
thy
appearance
and
assume
no
more
their
dreadful
shapes
till
thou
art
gone
again
bring
me
then
that
kind
cessation
bring
me
my
and
set
me
above
the
thoughts
of
cares
frights
or
any
other
thoughts
but
those
of
tender
love
haste
then
thou
charming
object
of
my
eternal
wishes
and
of
my
new
desires
haste
to
my
arms
my
eyes
my
soul
but
oh
be
wondrous
careful
there
do
not
betray
the
easy
maid
that
trusts
thee
amidst
all
her
sacred
store
almost
dark
and
my
mother
is
retired
to
her
chamber
my
father
to
his
cabinet
and
has
left
all
that
apartment
next
the
garden
wholly
without
spies
i
have
by
trusty
sent
you
a
key
got
made
to
the
door
which
leads
from
the
garden
to
the
to
my
apartment
so
carefully
locked
and
the
original
key
so
closely
guarded
by
my
jealous
father
that
way
i
beg
you
to
come
a
way
but
too
well
known
to
and
by
which
he
has
made
many
an
escape
to
and
from
oh
damn
that
thought
what
makes
it
torturing
me
let
me
change
it
for
those
of
the
advantage
will
be
as
great
as
bartering
hell
for
heaven
haste
then
but
what
need
i
bid
thee
love
will
lend
thee
his
wings
thou
who
commandest
all
his
artillery
put
them
on
and
fly
to
thy
languishing
sylvia
i
faint
with
the
dear
thought
of
thy
the
sylvia
with
much
ado
with
many
a
sigh
a
panting
heart
and
many
a
languishing
look
back
towards
happy
i
have
recovered
his
farm
where
i
threw
me
on
a
bed
and
lay
without
motion
and
almost
without
life
for
two
hours
till
at
last
through
all
my
sighs
my
great
concern
my
torment
my
love
and
rage
broke
silence
and
burst
into
all
the
different
complaints
both
soft
and
mad
by
turns
that
ever
possessed
a
soul
extravagantly
seized
with
frantic
love
ah
what
did
not
i
say
how
did
i
not
curse
and
who
except
my
charming
maid
for
yet
my
is
a
maid
yes
yes
ye
envying
powers
she
is
and
yet
the
sacred
and
inestimable
treasure
was
offered
a
trembling
victim
to
the
overjoyed
and
fancied
deity
for
then
and
there
i
thought
myself
happier
than
a
triumphing
god
but
having
overcome
all
difficulties
all
the
fatigues
and
toils
of
love
s
long
sieges
vanquish
d
the
mighty
phantom
of
the
fair
the
giant
honour
and
routed
all
the
numerous
host
of
women
s
little
reasonings
passed
all
the
bounds
of
peevish
modesty
nay
even
all
the
loose
and
silken
counterscarps
that
fenced
the
sacred
fort
and
nothing
stopped
my
glorious
pursuit
then
then
ye
gods
just
then
by
an
to
fall
just
fainting
before
the
surrendering
gates
unable
to
receive
the
yielding
treasure
oh
what
malicious
at
my
glory
seized
my
vigour
what
god
envious
of
my
mighty
joy
rendered
me
a
shameful
object
of
his
raillery
snatched
my
till
then
never
failing
power
and
left
me
dying
on
thy
charming
bosom
heavens
how
i
lay
silent
with
wonder
rage
and
ecstasy
of
love
unable
to
complain
or
rail
or
storm
or
seek
for
ease
but
with
my
sighs
alone
which
made
up
all
my
breath
my
mad
desires
remained
but
all
inactive
as
age
or
death
itself
as
cold
and
feeble
as
unfit
for
joy
as
if
my
youthful
fire
had
long
been
past
or
had
never
been
blest
with
charms
tell
me
thou
wondrous
perfect
creature
tell
me
where
lay
the
hidden
witchcraft
was
beauty
too
divine
to
mix
with
mortal
joys
ah
no
twas
ravishing
but
human
all
yet
sure
twas
so
approaching
to
divinity
as
changed
my
fire
to
awful
adoration
and
all
my
wanton
heat
to
reverent
but
this
is
nonsense
all
it
was
something
more
that
gave
me
rage
despair
and
torments
insupportable
no
it
was
no
dull
devotion
tame
divinity
but
mortal
killing
agony
unlucky
disappointment
unnatural
impotence
oh
i
am
lost
enchanted
by
some
magic
spell
oh
what
can
say
what
can
she
think
of
my
fond
passion
she
ll
swear
it
is
all
a
cheat
i
had
it
not
no
it
could
not
be
such
tales
i
ve
often
heard
as
often
laughed
at
too
of
disappointed
lovers
would
believe
as
sure
she
may
mine
was
excess
of
passion
what
my
being
arrived
to
all
the
joy
of
love
just
come
to
reap
the
glorious
recompense
the
full
reward
the
heaven
for
all
my
sufferings
do
i
lie
gazing
only
and
no
more
a
dull
a
feeble
unconcerned
admirer
oh
my
eternal
shame
curse
on
my
youth
give
me
ye
powers
old
age
for
that
has
some
excuse
but
youth
has
none
tis
dullness
stupid
insensibility
where
shall
i
hide
my
head
when
this
lewd
story
s
told
when
it
shall
be
confirmed
the
young
the
brisk
and
gay
who
never
failed
the
woman
he
scarce
wished
for
never
baulked
the
amorous
conceited
old
nor
the
young
yet
when
he
had
extended
in
his
arms
the
young
the
charming
fair
and
longing
the
untouched
unspotted
and
till
then
unwishing
lovely
maid
yielded
defenceless
and
unguarded
all
he
wanted
power
to
seize
the
trembling
prey
defend
me
heaven
from
madness
oh
i
have
reflected
on
all
the
little
circumstances
that
might
occasion
this
disaster
and
damn
me
to
this
degree
of
coldness
but
i
can
fix
on
none
i
had
it
is
true
for
sake
some
apprehensions
of
fear
of
being
surprised
for
coming
through
the
garden
i
saw
at
the
farther
end
a
man
at
least
i
fancied
by
that
light
it
was
a
man
who
perceiving
the
glimpse
of
something
approach
from
the
grove
made
softly
towards
me
but
with
such
caution
as
if
he
feared
to
be
mistaken
in
the
person
as
much
as
i
was
to
approach
him
and
reminding
what
told
me
of
an
assignation
she
had
made
to
the
count
imagined
it
him
nor
was
i
mistaken
when
i
heard
his
voice
calling
in
low
tone
at
which
i
mended
my
pace
and
ere
he
got
half
way
the
garden
recovered
the
door
and
softly
unlocking
it
got
in
unperceived
and
fastened
it
after
me
well
enough
assured
that
he
saw
not
which
way
i
vanished
however
it
failed
not
to
alarm
me
with
some
fears
on
your
dear
account
that
disturbed
my
repose
and
which
i
thought
then
not
necessary
to
impart
to
you
and
which
indeed
all
vanished
at
the
sight
of
my
adorable
maid
when
entering
thy
apartment
i
beheld
thee
extended
on
a
bed
of
roses
in
garments
which
if
possible
by
their
wanton
loose
negligence
and
gaiety
augmented
thy
natural
charms
i
trembling
fell
on
my
knees
by
your
and
gazed
a
while
unable
to
speak
for
transports
of
joy
and
love
you
too
were
silent
and
remained
so
so
long
that
i
ventured
to
press
your
lips
with
mine
which
all
their
eager
kisses
could
not
put
in
motion
so
that
i
feared
you
fainted
a
sudden
fright
that
in
a
moment
changed
my
fever
of
love
into
a
cold
ague
fit
but
you
revived
me
with
a
sigh
again
and
fired
me
anew
by
pressing
my
hand
and
from
that
silent
soft
encouragement
i
by
degrees
ravished
a
thousand
blisses
yet
still
between
your
tempting
charming
kisses
you
would
cry
oh
my
do
not
injure
me
be
sure
you
press
me
not
to
the
last
joys
of
love
oh
have
a
care
or
i
am
undone
for
ever
restrain
your
roving
hands
oh
whither
would
they
wander
my
soul
my
joy
my
everlasting
charmer
oh
whither
would
you
go
thus
with
a
thousand
cautions
more
which
did
but
raise
what
you
designed
to
calm
you
made
me
but
the
madder
to
possess
not
all
the
vows
you
bid
me
call
to
mind
could
now
restrain
my
wild
and
headstrong
passion
my
raving
raging
but
my
soft
desire
no
no
it
was
not
in
the
power
of
feeble
flesh
and
blood
to
find
resistance
against
so
many
charms
yet
still
you
made
me
swear
still
i
protested
but
still
burnt
on
with
the
same
torturing
flame
till
the
vast
pleasure
even
became
a
pain
to
add
to
this
i
saw
yes
not
all
your
art
and
modesty
could
hide
it
i
saw
the
ravishing
maid
as
much
inflamed
as
i
she
burnt
with
equal
fire
with
equal
languishment
not
all
her
care
could
keep
the
sparks
concealed
but
it
broke
out
in
every
word
and
look
her
trembling
tongue
her
feeble
fainting
voice
betrayed
it
all
sighs
interrupting
every
syllable
a
languishment
i
never
saw
till
then
dwelt
in
her
charming
eyes
that
contradicted
all
her
little
vows
her
short
and
double
breathings
heaved
her
breast
her
swelling
snowy
breast
her
hands
that
grasped
me
trembling
as
they
closed
while
she
permitted
mine
unknown
unheeded
to
traverse
all
her
beauties
till
quite
forgetting
all
i
had
faintly
promised
and
wholly
abandoning
my
soul
to
joy
i
rushed
upon
her
who
all
fainting
lay
beneath
my
useless
weight
for
on
a
sudden
all
my
power
was
fled
swifter
than
lightning
hurried
through
my
enfeebled
veins
and
vanished
all
not
the
dear
lovely
beauty
which
i
pressed
the
dying
charms
of
that
fair
face
and
eyes
the
clasps
of
those
soft
arms
nor
the
bewitching
accent
of
her
voice
that
murmured
love
half
smothered
in
her
sighs
nor
all
my
love
my
vast
my
mighty
passion
could
call
my
fugitive
vigour
back
again
oh
no
the
more
i
looked
the
more
i
touched
and
saw
the
more
i
was
undone
oh
pity
me
my
too
i
too
lovely
maid
do
not
revile
the
faults
which
you
alone
create
consider
all
your
charms
at
once
exposed
consider
every
sense
about
me
ravished
overcome
with
joys
too
mighty
to
be
supported
no
wonder
if
i
fell
a
shameful
sacrifice
to
the
fond
deity
consider
how
i
waited
how
i
strove
and
still
i
burnt
on
and
every
tender
touch
still
added
fuel
to
the
vigorous
fire
which
by
your
delay
consumed
itself
in
burning
i
want
philosophy
to
make
this
out
or
faith
to
fix
my
unhappiness
on
any
chance
or
natural
accident
but
this
my
charming
i
am
sure
that
had
i
loved
you
less
i
d
been
less
wretched
nor
had
we
parted
on
so
ill
terms
nor
had
i
left
you
with
an
opinion
so
disadvantageous
for
but
for
that
unhappy
noise
at
your
which
alarming
your
fear
occasioned
your
recovery
from
that
dear
trance
to
which
love
and
soft
desire
had
reduced
you
and
me
from
the
most
tormenting
silent
agony
that
disappointed
joy
ever
possessed
a
fond
expecting
heart
with
oh
heavens
to
have
my
in
my
power
favoured
by
silence
night
and
safe
retreat
then
then
to
lie
a
tame
cold
sigher
only
as
if
my
gave
that
assignation
alone
by
stealth
undressed
all
loose
and
languishing
fit
for
the
mighty
business
of
the
night
only
to
hear
me
prattle
see
me
gaze
or
tell
her
what
a
pretty
sight
it
was
to
see
the
moon
shine
through
the
dancing
boughs
oh
damn
my
hardened
dullness
but
no
more
i
am
all
fire
and
madness
at
the
thought
but
i
was
saying
we
both
recovered
then
when
the
noise
alarmed
us
i
long
to
know
whether
you
think
we
were
betrayed
for
on
that
knowledge
rests
a
mighty
part
of
my
destiny
i
hope
we
are
not
by
an
accident
that
befell
me
at
my
going
away
which
but
for
my
untimely
force
of
leaving
my
lovely
which
gave
me
pains
insupportable
would
have
given
me
great
diversion
you
know
our
fear
of
being
discovered
occasioned
my
disguise
for
you
found
it
necessary
i
should
depart
your
fear
had
so
prevailed
and
that
in
and
thus
attired
with
much
ado
i
went
and
left
my
soul
behind
me
and
finding
no
body
all
along
the
gallery
nor
in
my
passage
from
your
apartment
into
the
garden
i
was
a
thousand
times
about
to
return
to
all
my
joys
when
in
the
midst
of
this
almost
ended
dispute
i
saw
by
the
light
of
the
moon
which
was
by
good
fortune
under
a
cloud
and
could
not
distinctly
direct
the
sight
a
man
making
towards
me
with
cautious
speed
which
made
me
advance
with
the
more
haste
to
recover
the
grove
believing
to
have
escaped
him
under
the
covert
of
the
trees
for
retreat
i
could
not
without
betraying
which
way
i
went
but
just
at
the
entrance
of
the
thicket
he
turning
short
made
up
to
me
and
i
perceived
it
the
count
who
taking
me
for
whom
it
seems
he
expected
caught
hold
of
my
gown
as
i
would
have
passed
him
and
cried
now
i
see
you
are
a
maid
of
honour
come
retire
with
me
into
the
grove
where
i
have
a
present
of
a
heart
and
something
else
to
make
you
that
will
be
of
more
advantage
to
you
than
that
of
though
something
i
all
confounded
knew
not
what
to
reply
nor
how
lest
he
should
find
his
mistake
at
least
if
he
discovered
not
who
i
was
which
silence
gave
him
occasion
to
go
on
which
he
did
in
this
manner
what
not
a
word
or
do
you
design
i
shall
take
your
silence
for
consent
if
so
come
my
pretty
creature
let
us
not
lose
the
hour
love
has
given
us
at
this
he
would
have
advanced
leading
me
by
the
hand
which
he
pressed
and
kissed
very
amorously
judge
my
adorable
in
what
a
fine
condition
your
then
was
in
what
should
i
do
to
go
had
disappointed
him
worse
than
i
was
with
thee
before
not
to
go
betrayed
me
i
had
much
ado
to
hold
my
countenance
and
unwilling
to
speak
while
i
was
thus
employed
in
thought
pulling
me
eager
of
joys
to
come
and
i
holding
back
he
stopped
and
cried
sure
you
came
not
hither
to
bring
me
a
i
then
replied
whispering
softly
sir
for
heaven
s
sake
sweetening
my
voice
as
much
as
possible
i
am
a
maid
and
would
not
be
discovered
for
the
can
discover
us
replied
my
lover
what
i
take
from
thee
shall
never
be
missed
not
by
himself
upon
thy
wedding
night
come
sweet
child
come
with
that
i
pulled
back
and
whispered
heavens
would
you
make
a
mistress
of
me
says
he
a
mistress
what
would
st
thou
be
a
cherubin
then
i
replied
as
before
i
am
no
whore
sir
no
cries
he
but
i
can
quickly
make
thee
one
i
have
my
tools
about
me
therefore
let
us
lose
no
time
but
fall
to
work
this
last
raillery
from
the
brisk
old
gentleman
had
in
spite
of
resolution
almost
made
me
burst
out
into
a
loud
laughter
when
he
took
more
gravity
upon
him
and
cried
come
come
why
all
this
foolish
argument
at
this
hour
in
this
place
and
after
so
much
serious
courtship
believe
me
i
ll
be
kind
to
thee
for
ever
with
that
he
clapped
fifty
guineas
in
a
purse
into
one
hand
and
something
else
that
shall
be
nameless
into
the
other
presents
that
had
been
both
worth
acceptance
all
this
while
was
i
studying
an
evasion
at
last
to
shorten
my
pleasant
adventure
looking
round
i
cried
softly
are
you
sure
sir
we
are
safe
for
heaven
s
sake
step
towards
the
garden
door
and
see
for
i
would
not
be
discovered
for
the
nor
i
cried
he
but
do
not
fear
all
is
safe
however
see
whispered
i
that
my
fear
may
not
disturb
your
with
that
he
went
toward
the
house
and
i
slipping
into
the
grove
got
immediately
into
the
meadow
where
waited
my
coming
with
so
i
left
the
expecting
lover
i
suppose
ranging
the
grove
for
his
fled
nymph
and
i
doubt
will
fall
heavy
on
poor
who
shall
have
the
guineas
either
to
restore
or
keep
as
she
and
the
angry
count
can
agree
i
leave
the
management
of
it
to
her
wit
and
conduct
this
account
i
thought
necessary
to
give
my
charmer
that
she
might
prepare
for
the
assault
who
understanding
all
that
passed
between
us
may
so
dispose
of
matters
that
no
discovery
may
happen
by
mistake
and
i
know
my
and
she
can
find
a
thousand
excuses
for
the
supposed
flight
but
my
adorable
maid
my
business
here
was
not
to
give
an
account
of
my
adventure
only
nor
of
my
ravings
but
to
tell
my
on
what
my
life
depends
which
is
in
a
permission
to
wait
on
her
again
this
ensuing
night
make
no
excuse
for
if
you
do
by
all
i
adore
in
heaven
and
earth
i
ll
end
my
life
here
where
i
received
it
i
will
say
no
more
nor
give
your
love
instructions
but
wait
impatiently
here
the
life
or
death
of
your
philander
six
o
clock
and
yet
my
eyes
have
not
closed
themselves
to
sleep
alexis
brilliard
me
hopes
of
a
kind
return
to
this
and
have
brought
their
flute
and
violin
to
charm
me
into
a
slumber
sylvia
as
i
am
sure
she
does
she
will
wake
me
with
a
dear
consent
to
see
me
if
not
i
only
wake
to
sleep
for
my
charmer
when
i
had
sealed
the
enclosed
my
page
whom
i
had
ordered
to
come
to
me
with
an
account
of
any
business
extraordinary
is
this
morning
arrived
with
a
letter
from
which
i
have
sent
here
enclosed
that
my
may
see
how
little
i
regard
the
world
or
the
mighty
revolution
in
hand
when
set
in
competition
with
the
least
hope
of
beholding
her
adorable
face
or
hearing
her
charming
tongue
when
it
whispers
the
soft
dictates
of
her
tender
heart
into
my
ravished
soul
one
moment
s
joy
like
that
surmounts
an
age
of
dull
empire
no
let
the
busy
unregarded
rout
perish
the
cause
fall
or
stand
alone
for
me
give
me
but
love
love
and
my
i
ask
no
more
of
heaven
to
which
vast
joy
could
you
but
imagine
o
wondrous
miracle
of
beauty
how
poor
and
little
i
esteem
the
valued
trifles
of
the
world
you
would
in
return
contemn
your
part
of
it
and
live
with
me
in
silent
shades
for
ever
oh
what
hast
thou
this
night
to
add
to
the
soul
of
thy
philander
the
count
of
i
ll
allow
you
my
dear
to
be
very
fond
of
so
much
beauty
as
the
world
must
own
adorns
the
lovely
i
ll
permit
love
too
to
rival
me
in
your
heart
but
not
glory
haste
then
my
dear
to
the
advance
of
that
make
no
delay
but
with
the
morning
s
dawn
let
me
find
you
in
my
arms
where
i
have
something
that
will
surprise
you
to
relate
to
you
you
were
last
night
expected
at
it
behoves
you
to
give
no
umbrage
to
persons
whose
interest
renders
them
enough
jealous
we
have
two
new
advancers
come
in
of
youth
and
money
teach
them
not
negligence
be
careful
and
let
nothing
hinder
you
from
taking
horse
immediately
as
you
value
the
repose
and
fortune
of
cesario
called
last
night
on
you
and
your
page
following
me
to
my
coach
whispered
me
if
i
had
any
earnest
business
with
you
he
knew
where
to
find
you
i
soon
imagined
where
and
bid
him
call
within
an
hour
for
this
and
post
with
it
immediately
though
philander
ah
what
have
i
done
and
where
shall
i
hide
my
guilty
blushing
face
thou
hast
undone
my
eternal
quiet
oh
thou
hast
ruin
d
my
everlasting
repose
and
i
must
never
never
look
abroad
again
curse
on
my
face
that
first
debauched
my
virtue
and
taught
thee
how
to
love
curse
on
my
tempting
youth
my
shape
my
air
my
eyes
my
voice
my
hands
and
every
charm
that
did
contribute
to
my
fatal
love
a
lasting
curse
on
all
but
those
of
the
adorable
and
those
even
in
this
raging
minute
my
furious
passion
dares
not
approach
with
an
indecent
thought
no
they
are
sacred
all
madness
itself
would
spare
them
and
shouldst
thou
now
behold
me
as
i
sit
my
hair
dishevelled
ruffled
and
disordered
my
eyes
bedewing
every
word
i
write
when
for
each
letter
i
let
fall
a
tear
then
pressed
with
thought
starting
i
dropped
my
pen
and
fell
to
rave
anew
and
tear
those
garments
whose
loose
negligence
helped
to
betray
me
to
my
shameful
ruin
wounding
my
breast
but
want
the
resolution
to
wound
it
as
i
ought
which
when
i
but
propose
love
stays
the
thought
raging
and
wild
as
it
is
the
conqueror
checks
it
with
whispering
only
to
my
soul
the
dear
name
calms
me
to
an
easiness
gives
me
the
pen
into
my
trembling
hand
and
i
pursue
my
silent
soft
complaint
oh
shouldst
thou
see
me
thus
in
all
these
sudden
different
changes
of
passion
thou
wouldst
say
i
were
mad
indeed
madness
itself
can
find
no
stranger
motions
and
i
would
calmly
ask
thee
for
i
am
calm
again
how
comes
it
my
adorable
that
thou
canst
possess
a
maid
with
so
much
madness
who
art
thyself
a
miracle
of
softness
all
sweet
and
all
serene
the
most
of
angel
in
thy
composition
that
ever
mingled
with
humanity
the
very
words
fall
so
gently
from
thy
tongue
are
uttered
with
a
voice
so
ravishingly
soft
a
tone
so
tender
and
so
full
of
love
it
would
charm
even
frenzy
calm
rude
distraction
and
wildness
would
become
a
silent
listener
there
s
such
a
sweet
serenity
in
thy
face
such
innocence
and
softness
in
thy
eyes
should
desert
savages
but
gaze
on
thee
sure
they
would
forget
their
native
forest
wildness
and
be
inspired
with
easy
gentleness
most
certainly
this
power
thou
hast
why
then
oh
tell
me
in
the
agony
of
my
soul
why
must
those
charms
that
bring
tranquillity
and
peace
to
all
make
me
alone
a
wild
unseemly
raver
why
has
it
contrary
effects
on
me
oh
all
i
act
and
say
is
perfect
madness
yet
this
is
the
least
unaccountable
part
of
my
most
wretched
story
oh
i
must
never
behold
thy
lovely
face
again
for
if
i
should
sure
i
should
blush
my
soul
away
no
no
i
must
not
nor
ever
more
believe
thy
dear
deluding
vows
never
thy
charming
perjured
oaths
after
a
violation
like
to
this
oh
heaven
what
have
i
done
yet
by
heaven
i
swear
i
dare
not
ask
my
soul
lest
it
inform
me
how
i
was
to
blame
unless
that
fatal
minute
would
instruct
me
how
to
revenge
my
wrongs
upon
my
heart
my
fond
betraying
heart
despair
and
madness
seize
me
darkness
and
horror
hide
me
from
human
sight
after
an
easiness
like
this
what
to
yield
to
yield
my
honour
betray
the
secrets
of
my
virgin
wishes
my
new
desires
my
unknown
shameful
hell
and
death
where
got
i
so
much
confidence
where
learned
i
the
hardened
and
unblushing
folly
to
wish
was
such
a
fault
as
is
a
crime
unpardonable
to
own
to
shew
desire
is
such
a
sin
in
virtue
as
must
deserve
reproach
from
all
the
world
but
i
unlucky
i
have
not
only
betrayed
all
these
but
with
a
transport
void
of
sense
and
shame
i
yield
to
thy
arms
i
ll
not
endure
the
thought
by
heaven
i
can
not
there
is
something
more
than
rage
that
animates
that
thought
some
magic
spell
that
in
the
midst
of
all
my
sense
of
shame
keeps
me
from
true
repentance
this
angers
me
and
makes
me
know
my
honour
but
a
phantom
now
i
could
curse
again
my
youth
and
love
but
oh
when
i
have
done
alas
i
find
myself
as
guilty
as
before
i
can
not
make
one
firm
resolve
against
thee
or
if
i
do
when
i
consider
thee
they
weigh
not
all
one
lovely
hair
of
thine
it
is
all
in
vain
the
charming
cause
remains
still
as
lovely
as
before
it
is
him
i
must
remove
from
my
fond
eyes
and
heart
him
i
must
banish
from
my
touch
my
smell
and
every
other
sense
by
heaven
i
can
not
bear
the
mighty
pressure
i
can
not
see
his
eyes
and
touch
his
hands
smell
the
perfume
every
pore
of
his
breathes
forth
taste
thy
soft
kisses
hear
thy
charming
voice
but
i
am
all
on
a
flame
no
it
is
these
i
must
exclaim
on
not
my
youth
it
is
they
debauch
my
soul
no
natural
propensity
in
me
to
yield
or
to
admit
of
such
destructive
fires
fain
i
would
put
it
off
but
it
will
not
do
i
am
the
aggressor
still
else
why
is
not
every
living
maid
undone
that
does
but
touch
or
see
thee
tell
me
why
no
the
fault
is
in
me
and
thou
art
were
but
my
soul
less
delicate
were
it
less
sensible
of
what
it
loves
and
likes
in
thee
i
yet
were
dully
happy
but
oh
there
is
a
nicety
there
so
charmed
so
apprehensive
of
thy
beauties
as
has
betrayed
me
to
unrest
for
ever
yet
something
i
will
do
to
tame
this
lewd
betrayer
of
my
right
and
it
shall
plead
no
more
in
thy
behalf
no
more
no
more
disperse
the
joys
which
it
conceives
through
every
vein
cold
and
insensible
by
nature
to
kindle
new
desires
no
more
shall
fill
me
with
unknown
curiosity
no
i
will
in
spite
of
all
the
perfumes
that
dwell
about
thee
in
spite
of
all
the
arts
thou
hast
of
looking
of
speaking
and
of
touching
i
will
i
say
assume
my
native
temper
i
will
be
calm
be
cold
and
unconcerned
as
i
have
been
to
all
the
world
but
to
the
almighty
power
he
has
is
unaccountable
by
yonder
breaking
day
that
opens
in
the
east
opens
to
see
my
shame
i
swear
by
that
great
ruler
of
the
day
the
sun
by
that
almighty
power
that
rules
them
both
i
swear
i
swear
charming
lovely
youth
thou
art
the
first
e
er
kindled
soft
desires
about
my
soul
thou
art
the
first
that
ever
did
inform
me
that
there
was
such
a
sort
of
wish
about
me
i
thought
the
vanity
of
being
beloved
made
up
the
greatest
part
of
the
satisfaction
it
was
joy
to
see
my
lovers
sigh
about
me
adore
and
praise
me
and
increase
my
pride
by
every
look
by
every
word
and
action
and
him
i
fancied
best
i
favoured
most
and
he
past
for
the
happy
fortune
him
i
have
suffered
too
to
kiss
and
press
me
to
tell
me
all
his
tale
of
love
and
sigh
which
i
would
listen
to
with
pride
and
pleasure
permitted
it
and
smiled
him
kind
returns
nay
by
my
life
then
thought
i
loved
him
too
thought
i
could
have
been
content
to
have
passed
my
life
at
this
gay
rate
with
this
fond
hoping
lover
and
thought
no
farther
than
of
being
great
having
rich
coaches
shewing
equipage
to
pass
my
hours
in
dressing
in
going
to
the
operas
and
the
tower
make
visits
where
i
list
be
seen
at
balls
and
having
still
the
vanity
to
think
the
men
would
gaze
and
languish
where
i
came
and
all
the
women
envy
me
i
thought
no
farther
on
but
thou
hast
made
me
take
new
measures
i
now
can
think
of
nothing
but
of
thee
i
loathe
the
sound
of
love
from
any
other
voice
and
conversation
makes
my
soul
impatient
and
does
not
only
dull
me
into
melancholy
but
perplexes
me
out
of
all
humour
out
of
all
patient
sufferance
and
i
am
never
so
well
pleased
when
from
as
when
i
am
retired
and
curse
my
character
and
figure
in
the
world
because
it
permits
me
not
to
prevent
being
visited
one
thought
of
thee
is
worth
the
world
s
enjoyment
i
hate
to
dress
i
hate
to
be
agreeable
to
any
eyes
but
thine
i
hate
the
noise
of
equipage
and
crowds
and
would
be
more
content
to
live
with
thee
in
some
lone
shaded
cottage
than
be
a
queen
and
hindered
by
that
grandeur
one
moment
s
conversation
with
may
st
thou
despise
and
loathe
me
a
curse
the
greatest
that
i
can
invent
if
this
be
any
thing
but
real
honest
truth
no
no
i
find
i
never
lov
d
till
now
i
understood
it
not
nor
knew
what
those
sighs
and
pressings
meant
which
others
gave
me
yet
every
speaking
glance
thy
eyes
put
on
inform
my
soul
what
it
is
they
plead
and
languish
for
if
you
but
touch
my
hand
my
breath
grows
faint
and
short
my
blood
glows
in
my
face
and
runs
with
an
unusual
warmth
through
every
vein
and
tells
my
heart
what
it
is
ails
when
he
falls
sighing
on
my
bosom
oh
then
i
fear
i
answer
every
look
and
every
sigh
and
touch
in
the
same
silent
but
intelligible
language
and
understood
i
fear
too
well
by
thee
till
now
i
never
feared
love
as
a
criminal
oh
tell
me
not
mistaken
foolish
maids
true
love
is
innocent
ye
cold
ye
dull
ye
unconsidering
lovers
though
i
have
often
heard
it
from
the
grave
and
wise
and
preached
myself
that
doctrine
i
now
renounce
it
all
it
is
false
by
heaven
it
is
false
for
now
i
love
and
know
it
all
a
fiction
yes
and
love
so
as
never
any
woman
can
equal
me
in
love
my
soul
being
all
composed
as
i
have
often
said
of
softer
materials
nor
is
it
fancy
sets
my
rates
on
beauty
there
is
an
intrinsic
value
in
thy
charms
who
surely
none
but
i
am
able
to
understand
and
to
those
that
view
thee
not
with
my
judging
eyes
ugliness
fancied
would
appear
the
same
and
please
as
well
if
all
could
love
or
judge
like
me
why
does
pass
so
unregarded
by
a
thousand
women
who
never
sighed
for
him
what
makes
who
possesses
all
looks
on
thee
feels
thy
kisses
hears
thee
speak
and
yet
wants
sense
to
know
how
blessed
she
is
it
is
want
of
judgement
all
and
how
and
how
can
she
that
judges
ill
love
well
granting
my
passion
equal
to
its
object
you
must
allow
it
infinite
and
more
in
me
than
any
other
woman
by
how
much
more
my
soul
is
composed
of
tenderness
and
yet
i
say
i
own
for
i
may
own
it
now
heaven
and
you
are
witness
of
my
shame
i
own
with
all
this
love
with
all
this
passion
so
vast
so
true
and
so
unchangeable
that
i
have
wishes
new
unwonted
wishes
at
every
thought
of
thee
i
find
a
strange
disorder
in
my
blood
that
pants
and
burns
in
every
vein
and
makes
me
blush
and
sigh
and
grow
impatient
ashamed
and
angry
but
when
i
know
it
the
effects
of
love
i
am
reconciled
and
wish
and
sigh
anew
for
when
i
sit
and
gaze
upon
thy
eyes
thy
languishing
thy
lovely
dying
eyes
play
with
thy
soft
white
hand
and
lay
my
glowing
cheeks
to
thine
oh
god
what
language
can
express
my
transport
all
that
is
tender
all
that
is
soft
desire
seizes
every
trembling
limb
and
it
is
with
pain
yes
yes
it
is
the
fatal
truth
since
thou
hast
found
it
i
confess
it
too
and
yet
i
love
thee
dearly
long
long
it
was
that
i
essayed
to
hide
the
guilty
flame
if
love
be
guilt
for
i
confess
i
did
dissemble
a
coldness
which
i
was
not
mistress
of
there
lies
a
woman
s
art
there
all
her
boasted
virtue
it
is
but
well
dissembling
and
no
more
but
mine
alas
is
gone
for
ever
fled
this
this
feeble
guard
that
should
secure
my
honour
thou
hast
betrayed
and
left
it
quite
defenceless
ah
what
s
a
woman
s
honour
when
it
is
so
poorly
guarded
no
wonder
that
you
conquer
with
such
ease
when
we
are
only
safe
by
the
mean
arts
of
base
dissimulation
an
ill
as
shameful
as
that
to
which
we
fall
oh
silly
refuge
what
foolish
nonsense
fond
custom
can
persuade
yet
so
it
is
and
she
that
breaks
her
laws
loses
her
fame
her
honour
and
esteem
oh
heavens
how
quickly
lost
it
is
give
me
ye
powers
my
fame
and
let
me
be
a
fool
let
me
retain
my
virtue
and
my
honour
and
be
a
dull
insensible
but
oh
where
is
it
i
have
lost
it
all
it
is
irrecoverably
lost
yes
yes
ye
charming
perjured
man
it
is
gone
and
thou
hast
quite
undone
what
though
i
lay
extended
on
my
bed
undressed
unapprehensive
of
my
fate
my
bosom
loose
and
easy
of
access
my
garments
ready
thin
and
wantonly
put
on
as
if
they
would
with
little
force
submit
to
the
fond
straying
hand
what
then
must
you
take
the
advantage
must
you
be
perjured
because
i
was
tempting
it
is
true
i
let
you
in
by
stealth
by
night
whose
silent
darkness
favoured
your
treachery
but
oh
were
not
your
vows
as
binding
by
a
glimmering
taper
as
if
the
sun
with
all
his
awful
light
had
been
a
looker
on
i
urged
your
vows
as
you
pressed
on
but
oh
i
fear
it
was
in
such
a
way
so
faintly
and
so
feebly
i
upbraided
you
as
did
but
more
advance
your
perjuries
your
strength
increas
d
but
mine
alas
declin
d
i
quite
fainted
in
your
arms
left
you
triumphant
lord
of
all
no
more
my
faint
denials
do
persuade
no
more
my
trembling
hands
resist
your
force
unregarded
lay
the
treasure
which
you
toil
d
for
betrayed
and
yielded
to
the
lovely
conqueror
but
oh
tormenting
when
you
saw
the
store
and
found
the
prize
no
richer
with
what
contempt
yes
false
dear
man
with
what
contempt
you
view
d
the
unvalu
d
trophy
what
despised
was
all
you
call
a
heaven
of
joy
and
beauty
exposed
to
view
and
then
neglected
were
all
your
prayers
heard
your
wishes
granted
and
your
toils
rewarded
the
trembling
victim
ready
for
the
sacrifice
and
did
you
want
devotion
to
perform
it
and
did
you
thus
receive
the
expected
blessing
oh
by
heaven
i
ll
never
see
thee
more
and
it
will
be
charity
to
thee
for
thou
hast
no
excuse
in
store
that
can
convince
my
opinion
that
i
am
hated
loathed
i
can
not
bear
that
thought
or
if
i
do
it
shall
only
serve
to
fortify
my
fixed
resolve
never
to
see
thee
and
yet
i
long
to
hear
thy
false
excuse
let
it
be
quickly
then
it
is
my
disdain
invites
thee
to
strengthen
which
there
needs
no
more
than
that
you
let
me
hear
your
poor
but
it
is
a
tedious
time
to
that
slow
hour
wherein
i
dare
permit
thee
but
hope
not
to
incline
my
soul
to
love
no
i
am
yet
safe
if
i
can
stop
but
here
but
here
be
wise
resolve
and
be
myself
sylvia
philander
as
my
page
was
coming
with
the
enclosed
he
met
at
the
gate
with
yours
and
who
would
not
depart
without
an
answer
to
it
to
go
or
stay
is
the
question
ah
philander
why
do
you
press
a
heart
too
ready
to
yield
to
love
and
you
alas
i
fear
you
guess
too
well
my
answer
and
your
own
soul
might
save
me
the
blushing
trouble
of
a
reply
i
am
plunged
in
past
hope
of
a
retreat
and
since
my
fate
has
pointed
me
out
for
ruin
i
can
not
fall
more
gloriously
take
then
to
your
dear
arms
a
maid
that
can
no
longer
resist
who
is
disarmed
of
all
defensive
power
she
yields
she
yields
and
does
confess
it
too
and
sure
she
must
be
more
than
mortal
that
can
hold
out
against
thy
charms
and
vows
since
i
must
be
undone
and
give
all
away
i
ll
do
it
generously
and
scorn
all
mean
reserves
i
will
be
brave
in
love
and
lavish
all
nor
shall
think
i
love
him
well
unless
i
do
take
charming
victor
then
what
your
own
merits
and
what
love
has
given
you
take
take
at
last
the
dear
reward
of
all
your
sighs
and
tears
your
vows
and
sufferings
but
since
it
is
an
age
to
night
and
till
the
approach
of
those
dear
silent
hours
thou
knowest
i
dare
not
give
thee
admittance
i
do
conjure
thee
go
to
whom
i
find
too
pressing
not
to
believe
the
concerns
great
and
so
jealous
i
am
of
thy
dear
safety
that
every
thing
alarms
my
fears
oh
satisfy
them
then
and
go
it
is
early
yet

satisfaction

thou
most
charming
of
thy
sex
thou
lovely
dear
delight
of
my
transported
soul
thou
everlasting
treasure
of
my
heart
what
hast
thou
done
given
me
an
that
fails
but
very
little
of
performing
what
grief
s
excess
had
almost
finished
before
eternal
blessings
on
thee
for
a
goodness
so
divine
oh
thou
most
excellent
and
dearest
of
thy
sex
i
know
not
what
to
do
or
what
to
say
i
am
not
what
i
was
i
do
not
speak
nor
walk
nor
think
as
i
was
wont
to
do
sure
the
excess
of
joy
is
far
above
dull
sense
or
formal
thinking
it
can
not
stay
for
ceremonious
method
i
rave
with
pleasure
rage
with
the
dear
thought
of
coming
ecstasy
oh
my
soul
my
vital
blood
and
without
which
i
could
as
well
subsist
oh
my
adorable
my
methinks
i
press
thee
kiss
thee
hear
thee
sigh
behold
thy
eyes
and
all
the
wondrous
beauty
of
thy
face
a
solemn
joy
has
spread
itself
through
every
vein
sensibly
through
every
artery
of
my
heart
and
i
can
think
of
nothing
but
of
the
lovely
the
blooming
flowing
and
shall
i
see
thee
shall
i
touch
thy
hands
and
press
thy
dear
thy
charming
body
in
my
arms
and
taste
a
thousand
joys
a
thousand
ravishments
oh
god
shall
i
oh
say
but
thou
hast
said
enough
to
make
me
mad
and
i
forgetful
of
thy
safety
and
my
own
shall
bring
thy
wild
adoring
slave
to
and
throw
him
at
thy
feet
to
pay
his
humble
gratitude
for
this
great
condescension
this
vast
bounty
ah
how
shall
i
live
till
night
and
you
impose
too
cruelly
upon
me
in
conjuring
me
to
go
to
alas
does
know
to
what
she
exposes
her
whose
joy
is
so
transporting
great
that
when
he
comes
into
the
grave
cabal
he
must
betray
the
story
of
his
heart
and
in
lieu
of
the
mighty
business
there
in
hand
be
raving
still
on
telling
his
joy
to
all
the
amazed
listeners
and
answering
questions
that
concern
our
great
affair
with
something
of
my
love
all
which
will
pass
for
madness
and
undo
me
no
give
me
leave
to
rave
in
silence
and
unseen
among
the
trees
they
ll
humour
my
disease
answer
my
murmuring
joy
and
echoes
flatter
it
repeat
thy
name
repeat
that
mine
and
never
hurt
her
fame
while
the
cabals
business
and
noisy
town
will
add
confusion
to
my
present
transport
and
make
me
mad
indeed
no
let
me
alone
thou
sacred
lovely
creature
let
me
be
calm
and
quiet
here
and
tell
all
the
insensibles
i
meet
in
the
woods
what
has
this
happy
minute
destined
me
oh
let
me
record
it
on
every
bark
on
every
oak
and
beech
that
all
the
world
may
wonder
at
my
fortune
and
bless
the
generous
maid
let
it
grow
up
to
ages
that
shall
come
that
they
may
know
the
story
of
our
loves
and
how
a
happy
youth
they
called
was
once
so
blest
by
heaven
as
to
possess
the
charming
the
adored
and
loved
by
all
the
glorious
a
maid
the
most
divine
that
ever
graced
a
story
and
when
the
nymphs
would
look
for
an
example
of
love
and
constancy
let
them
point
out
to
their
doubted
swains
and
cry
ah
love
but
as
the
young
did
and
then
be
fortunate
and
then
reap
all
your
wishes
and
when
the
shepherd
would
upbraid
his
nymph
let
him
but
cry
see
here
what
did
to
save
the
young
but
oh
there
never
will
be
such
another
nymph
as
heaven
formed
but
one
to
shew
the
world
what
angels
are
and
she
was
formed
for
me
yes
she
was
in
whom
i
would
not
quit
my
glorious
interest
to
reign
a
monarch
here
or
any
boasted
gilded
thing
above
take
all
take
all
ye
gods
and
give
me
but
this
happy
coming
night
oh
by
all
thy
promised
joys
i
am
undone
if
any
accident
should
ravish
this
night
from
me
this
night
no
not
for
a
lease
of
years
to
all
eternity
would
i
throw
thee
away
oh
i
am
all
flame
all
joyful
fire
and
softness
methinks
it
is
heaven
i
look
round
me
air
where
i
tread
and
ravishing
music
when
i
speak
because
it
is
all
of
let
me
alone
oh
let
me
cool
a
little
or
i
shall
by
an
excess
of
joyful
thought
lose
all
my
hoped
for
bliss
remove
a
little
from
me
go
my
you
are
so
excessive
sweet
so
wondrous
dazzling
you
press
my
senses
even
to
pain
away
let
me
take
air
let
me
recover
breath
oh
let
me
lay
me
down
beneath
some
cooling
shade
near
some
refreshing
crystal
murmuring
spring
and
fan
the
gentle
air
about
me
i
suffocate
i
faint
with
this
close
loving
i
must
allay
my
joy
or
be
undone
i
will
read
thy
cruel
letters
or
i
will
think
of
some
sad
melancholy
hour
wherein
thou
hast
dismissed
me
despairing
from
thy
presence
or
while
you
press
me
now
to
be
gone
with
so
much
earnestness
you
have
some
lover
to
receive
and
entertain
perhaps
it
is
only
for
the
vanity
to
hear
him
tell
his
nauseous
passion
to
you
breathe
on
your
lovely
face
and
daub
your
garments
with
his
fulsome
embrace
but
oh
by
heaven
i
can
not
think
that
thought
and
thou
hast
sworn
thou
canst
not
suffer
it
if
i
should
find
thee
false
but
it
is
oh
should
i
find
visit
thee
him
whom
thy
parents
favour
i
should
undo
you
all
by
heaven
i
should
but
thou
hast
sworn
what
need
more
yes
thou
hast
sworn
and
called
heaven
s
vengeance
down
whenever
thou
gavest
a
look
or
a
dear
smile
in
love
to
that
pretending
fop
yet
from
his
mighty
fortune
there
is
danger
in
him
what
makes
that
thought
torment
me
now
be
gone
for
loves
me
and
will
preserve
my
life
i
am
not
able
my
adorable
charmer
to
obey
your
commands
in
going
from
the
sight
of
happy
no
let
the
great
wheel
of
the
vast
design
roll
on
or
for
ever
stand
still
for
i
will
not
aid
its
motion
to
leave
the
mightier
business
of
my
love
unfinished
no
let
fortune
and
the
duller
fools
toil
on
for
i
ll
not
bate
a
minute
of
my
joys
with
thee
to
save
the
world
much
less
so
poor
a
parcel
of
it
and
sure
there
is
more
solid
pleasure
even
in
these
expecting
hours
i
wait
to
snatch
my
bliss
than
to
be
lord
of
all
the
universe
without
it
then
let
me
wait
my
in
those
melancholy
shades
that
part
from
farm
perhaps
my
may
walk
that
way
so
unattended
that
we
might
meet
and
lose
ourselves
for
a
few
moments
in
those
intricate
retreats
ah
i
am
dying
with
that
thought
oh
heavens
what
cruel
destiny
is
mine
whose
fatal
circumstances
do
not
permit
me
to
own
my
passion
and
lay
claim
to
to
take
her
without
control
to
shades
and
palaces
to
live
for
ever
with
her
to
gaze
for
ever
on
her
to
eat
to
loll
to
rise
to
play
to
sleep
to
act
over
all
the
pleasures
and
the
joys
of
life
with
her
but
it
is
in
vain
i
rave
in
vain
employ
myself
in
the
fool
s
barren
business
wishing
this
thought
has
made
me
sad
as
death
oh
i
can
never
be
truly
happy
adieu
employ
thyself
in
writing
to
me
and
remember
my
life
bears
date
but
only
with
thy
faith
and
love
philander
my
adorable
what
you
can
do
to
meet
me
in
the
wood
this
afternoon
for
there
i
will
live
philander
obstinate
i
conjure
you
by
all
your
vows
by
all
your
sacred
love
by
those
dear
hours
this
happy
night
designed
in
favour
of
you
to
go
without
delay
to
twill
be
unsafe
to
disobey
a
prince
in
his
jealous
circumstances
the
fatigue
of
the
journey
can
not
be
great
and
you
well
know
the
torment
of
my
fears
oh
i
shall
never
be
happy
or
think
you
safe
till
you
have
quitted
this
fatal
interest
go
my
and
remember
whatever
toils
you
take
will
be
rewarded
at
night
in
the
arms
of
sylvia
sylvia
whatever
toils
you
take
shall
be
rewarded
in
the
arms
of
by
heaven
i
am
inspired
to
act
wonders
yes
yes
my
adorable
maid
i
am
gone
i
fly
as
swift
as
lightning
or
the
soft
darts
of
love
shot
from
thy
charming
eyes
and
i
can
hardly
stay
to
say
adieu
the
lady
long
foreseeing
the
misery
whereto
you
must
arrive
by
this
fatal
correspondence
with
my
unhappy
lord
i
have
often
with
tears
and
prayers
implored
you
to
decline
so
dangerous
a
passion
i
have
never
yet
acquainted
our
parents
with
your
misfortunes
but
i
fear
i
must
at
last
make
use
of
their
authority
for
the
prevention
of
your
ruin
it
is
not
my
dearest
child
that
part
of
this
unhappy
story
that
relates
to
me
that
grieves
me
but
purely
that
of
thine
consider
oh
young
noble
maid
the
infamy
of
being
a
prostitute
and
yet
the
act
itself
in
this
fatal
amour
is
not
the
greatest
sin
but
the
manner
which
carries
an
unusual
horror
with
it
for
it
is
a
brother
too
my
child
as
well
as
a
lover
one
that
has
lain
by
thy
unhappy
sister
s
side
so
many
tender
years
by
whom
he
has
a
dear
and
lovely
by
which
he
has
more
fixed
himself
to
thee
by
relation
and
blood
consider
this
oh
fond
heedless
girl
and
suffer
not
a
momentary
joy
to
rob
thee
of
thy
eternal
fame
me
of
my
eternal
repose
and
fix
a
brand
upon
our
noble
house
and
so
undo
us
alas
consider
after
an
action
so
shameful
thou
must
obscure
thyself
in
some
remote
corner
of
the
world
where
honesty
and
honour
never
are
heard
of
no
thou
canst
not
shew
thy
face
but
it
will
be
pointed
at
for
something
monstrous
for
a
hundred
ages
may
not
produce
a
story
so
lewdly
infamous
and
loose
as
thine
perhaps
fond
as
you
are
you
imagine
the
sole
joy
of
being
beloved
by
him
will
atone
for
those
affronts
and
reproaches
you
will
meet
with
in
the
censuring
world
but
child
remember
and
believe
me
there
is
no
lasting
faith
in
sin
he
that
has
broke
his
vows
with
heaven
and
me
will
be
again
perjured
to
heaven
and
thee
and
all
the
world
he
once
thought
me
as
lovely
lay
at
my
feet
and
sighed
away
his
soul
and
told
such
piteous
stories
of
his
sufferings
such
sad
such
mournful
tales
of
his
departed
rest
his
broken
heart
and
everlasting
love
that
sure
i
thought
it
had
been
a
sin
not
to
have
credited
his
charming
perjuries
in
such
a
way
he
swore
with
such
a
grace
he
sighed
so
artfully
he
moved
so
tenderly
he
looked
alas
dear
child
then
all
he
said
was
new
unusual
with
him
never
told
before
now
it
is
a
beaten
road
it
is
learned
by
heart
and
easily
addressed
to
any
fond
believing
woman
the
tattered
worn
out
fragments
of
my
trophies
the
dregs
of
what
i
long
since
drained
from
off
his
fickle
heart
then
it
was
fine
then
it
was
brisk
and
new
now
palled
and
dull
by
being
repeated
often
think
my
child
what
your
victorious
beauty
merits
the
victim
of
a
heart
unconquered
by
any
but
your
eyes
alas
he
has
been
my
captive
my
humble
whining
slave
disdain
to
put
him
on
your
fetters
now
alas
he
can
say
no
new
thing
of
his
heart
to
thee
it
is
love
at
second
hand
worn
out
and
all
its
gaudy
lustre
tarnished
besides
my
child
if
thou
hadst
no
religion
binding
enough
no
honour
that
could
stay
thy
fatal
course
yet
nature
should
oblige
thee
and
give
a
check
to
the
unreasonable
enterprise
the
griefs
and
dishonour
of
our
noble
parents
who
have
been
eminent
for
virtue
and
piety
oh
suffer
them
not
to
be
regarded
in
this
censuring
world
as
the
most
unhappy
of
all
the
race
of
old
nobility
thou
art
the
darling
child
the
joy
of
all
the
last
hope
left
the
refuge
of
their
sorrow
for
they
alas
have
had
but
unkind
stars
to
influence
their
unadvised
no
want
of
virtue
in
their
education
but
this
last
blow
of
fate
must
strike
them
dead
think
think
of
this
my
child
and
yet
retire
from
ruin
haste
fly
from
destruction
which
pursues
thee
fast
haste
haste
and
save
thy
parents
and
a
sister
or
what
is
more
dear
thy
fame
mine
has
already
received
but
too
many
desperate
wounds
and
all
through
my
unkind
lord
s
growing
passion
for
thee
which
was
most
fatally
founded
on
my
ruin
and
nothing
but
my
ruin
could
advance
it
and
when
my
sister
thou
hast
run
thy
race
made
thyself
loathed
undone
and
infamous
as
hell
despis
d
scorn
d
and
abandon
d
by
all
lampoon
d
perhaps
diseas
d
this
faithless
man
this
cause
of
all
will
leave
thee
too
grow
weary
of
thee
nauseated
by
use
he
may
perhaps
consider
what
sins
what
evils
and
what
inconveniencies
and
shames
thou
st
brought
him
to
and
will
not
be
the
last
shall
loathe
and
hate
thee
for
though
youth
fancy
it
have
a
mighty
race
to
run
of
pleasing
vice
and
vanity
the
course
will
end
the
goal
will
be
arrived
to
at
the
last
where
they
will
sighing
stand
look
back
and
view
the
length
of
precious
time
they
ve
fool
d
away
when
traversed
over
with
honour
and
discretion
how
glorious
were
the
journey
and
with
what
joy
the
wearied
traveller
lies
down
and
basks
beneath
the
shades
that
end
the
happy
course
forgive
dear
child
this
advice
and
pursue
it
it
is
the
effect
of
my
pity
not
anger
nor
could
the
name
of
rival
ever
yet
have
power
to
banish
that
of
sister
from
my
soul
farewell
remember
me
pray
heaven
thou
hast
not
this
night
made
a
forfeit
of
thy
honour
and
that
this
which
comes
from
a
tender
bleeding
heart
may
have
the
fortune
to
inspire
thee
with
grace
to
avoid
all
temptations
for
the
future
since
they
must
end
in
sorrows
which
is
the
eternal
prayer
of
child
affectionate
philander
ask
me
not
my
dearest
brother
the
reason
of
this
sudden
change
ask
me
no
more
from
whence
proceeds
this
strange
coldness
or
why
this
alteration
it
is
enough
my
destiny
has
not
decreed
me
for
alas
i
see
my
error
and
looking
round
about
me
find
nothing
but
approaching
horror
and
confusion
in
my
pursuit
of
love
oh
whither
was
i
going
to
what
dark
paths
to
what
everlasting
shades
had
smiling
love
betray
d
me
had
i
pursued
him
farther
but
i
at
last
have
subdued
his
force
and
the
fond
charmer
shall
no
more
renew
his
arts
and
flatteries
for
i
m
resolv
d
as
heaven
as
fix
d
as
fate
and
death
and
i
conjure
you
trouble
my
repose
no
more
for
if
you
do
regardless
of
my
honour
which
if
you
loved
you
would
preserve
i
will
do
a
deed
shall
free
me
from
your
importunities
that
shall
amaze
and
cool
your
vicious
flame
no
more
remember
you
have
a
noble
wife
companion
of
your
vows
and
i
have
honour
both
which
are
worth
preserving
and
for
which
though
you
want
generous
love
you
will
find
neither
that
nor
courage
wanting
in
sylvia
yes
my
adorable
i
will
pursue
you
no
farther
only
for
all
my
pains
for
all
my
sufferings
for
my
tormenting
sleepless
nights
and
thoughtful
anxious
days
for
all
my
faithless
hopes
my
fears
my
sighs
my
prayers
and
my
tears
for
my
unequalled
and
unbounded
passion
and
my
unwearied
pursuits
in
love
my
flame
and
lastly
for
my
death
i
only
beg
in
recompense
for
all
this
last
favour
from
your
pity
that
you
will
deign
to
view
the
bleeding
wound
that
pierced
the
truest
heart
that
ever
fell
a
sacrifice
to
love
you
will
find
my
body
lying
beneath
that
spreading
oak
so
sacred
to
since
it
was
there
he
first
took
into
his
greedy
ravished
soul
the
dear
the
soft
confession
of
thy
passion
though
now
forgotten
and
neglected
all
make
what
haste
you
can
you
will
find
there
stretched
out
the
mangled
carcase
of
the
lost
philander
sylvia
it
for
this
that
i
was
sent
in
such
haste
away
this
morning
did
i
for
this
neglect
the
world
our
great
affair
and
all
that
prince
s
interest
and
fly
back
bellfont
the
wings
of
love
where
in
lieu
of
receiving
a
dear
blessing
from
thy
hand
do
i
find
never
see
me
more
good
heaven
but
with
my
life
all
my
complaints
are
ended
only
it
would
be
some
ease
even
in
death
to
know
what
happy
rival
it
is
has
armed
thy
cruel
hand
philander
s
philander
stay
i
conjure
thee
stay
thy
sacrilegious
hand
for
the
least
wound
it
gives
the
lord
of
all
my
wishes
i
ll
double
on
my
breast
a
thousand
fold
stay
then
by
all
thy
vows
thy
love
and
all
thy
hopes
i
swear
thou
hast
this
night
a
full
recompense
of
all
thy
pains
from
yielding
i
do
conjure
thee
stay
for
when
the
news
arrives
thou
art
no
more
this
poor
this
lost
abandoned
heart
of
mine
shall
fall
a
victim
to
thy
cruelty
no
live
my
i
conjure
thee
and
receive
all
thou
canst
ask
and
all
that
can
be
given
by
sylvia
philander
oh
my
charming
how
very
ill
have
you
recompensed
my
last
lost
commands
which
were
that
you
should
live
and
yet
at
the
same
moment
while
you
are
reading
of
the
dear
obligation
and
while
my
page
was
waiting
your
kind
return
you
desperately
exposed
your
life
to
the
mercy
of
this
innocent
rival
betraying
unadvisedly
at
the
same
time
my
honour
and
the
secret
of
your
love
and
where
to
kill
or
to
be
killed
had
been
almost
equally
unhappy
it
was
well
my
page
told
me
you
disarmed
him
in
this
rencounter
yet
you
he
says
are
wounded
some
sacred
drops
of
blood
are
fallen
to
the
earth
and
lost
the
least
of
which
is
precious
enough
to
ransom
captive
queens
oh
haste
to
my
arms
for
cure
i
die
with
fear
there
may
be
danger
haste
and
let
me
bathe
the
dear
the
wounded
part
in
floods
of
tears
lay
to
my
warm
lips
and
bind
it
with
my
torn
hair
oh
i
rave
with
my
concern
for
thee
and
am
ready
to
break
all
laws
of
decency
and
duty
and
fly
without
considering
to
thy
succour
but
that
i
fear
to
injure
thee
much
more
by
the
discovery
which
such
an
unadvised
absence
would
make
pray
heaven
the
unlucky
adventure
reach
not
has
no
reason
to
proclaim
it
and
thou
art
too
generous
to
boast
the
conquest
and
my
page
was
the
only
witness
and
he
is
as
silent
and
as
secret
as
the
grave
but
why
was
he
sent
me
back
without
reply
what
meant
that
cruel
silence
say
my
will
you
not
obey
me
will
you
abandon
me
can
that
dear
tongue
be
perjured
and
can
you
this
night
disappoint
your
what
have
i
done
oh
obstinately
cruel
irreconcileable
what
for
my
first
offence
a
little
poor
resentment
and
no
more
a
little
faint
care
of
my
gasping
honour
could
that
displease
so
much
besides
i
had
a
cause
which
you
shall
see
a
letter
that
would
cool
love
s
hottest
fires
and
turn
it
to
devotion
by
heaven
it
was
such
a
check
such
a
surprise
but
you
yourself
shall
judge
if
after
that
i
could
say
less
than
bid
eternally
farewell
to
love
at
least
to
thee
but
i
recanted
soon
one
sad
dear
word
one
soft
resenting
line
from
thee
gained
love
the
day
again
and
i
despised
the
censures
of
the
duller
world
yes
yes
and
i
confessed
you
had
overcome
and
did
this
merit
no
reply
i
asked
the
boy
a
thousand
times
what
you
said
how
and
in
what
manner
you
received
it
chid
him
and
laid
your
silent
fault
on
him
till
he
with
tears
convinced
me
and
said
he
found
you
hastening
to
the
grove
and
when
he
gave
you
my
commands
you
looked
upon
him
with
such
a
wild
and
fixed
regard
surveying
him
all
over
while
you
were
opening
it
as
argued
some
unusual
motion
in
you
then
cried
be
gone
i
can
not
answer
flattery
good
heaven
what
can
you
mean
but
ere
he
got
to
the
farther
end
of
the
grove
where
still
you
walked
a
solemn
pace
he
saw
pass
him
unattended
and
looking
back
saw
your
rencounter
saw
all
that
happened
between
you
then
ran
to
your
assistance
just
as
you
parted
still
you
were
roughly
sullen
and
neither
took
notice
of
his
proffered
service
nor
that
you
needed
it
although
you
bled
apace
he
offered
you
his
aid
to
tie
your
wounds
up
but
you
replied
be
gone
and
do
not
trouble
me
oh
could
you
imagine
i
could
live
with
this
neglect
could
you
my
oh
what
would
you
have
me
do
if
nothing
but
my
death
or
ruin
can
suffice
for
my
atonement
i
will
sacrifice
either
with
joy
yes
i
ll
proclaim
my
passion
aloud
proclaim
it
at
own
the
dear
criminal
flame
fly
to
my
philander
s
aid
and
be
undone
for
thus
i
can
not
no
i
will
not
live
i
rave
i
languish
faint
and
die
with
pain
say
that
you
live
oh
say
but
that
you
live
say
you
are
coming
to
the
meadow
behind
the
in
order
to
your
approach
to
my
arms
oh
swear
that
all
your
vows
are
true
oh
swear
that
you
are
and
in
return
i
will
swear
that
i
am
yours
without
reserve
whatever
fate
is
destined
for
your
sylvia
die
with
impatience
either
to
see
or
hear
from
you
i
fear
it
is
yet
too
soon
for
the
first
oh
therefore
save
me
with
the
last
or
i
shall
rave
and
wildly
betray
all
by
coming
dorillus
farm
or
seeking
you
you
cruelly
have
hid
yourself
sylvia
sylvia
ah
how
have
you
in
one
day
destroyed
that
repose
i
have
been
designing
so
many
years
oh
thou
false
but
wondrous
fair
creature
why
did
heaven
ordain
so
much
beauty
and
so
much
perfidy
so
much
excellent
wit
and
so
much
cunning
things
inconsistent
in
any
but
in
in
one
divine
frame
but
to
undo
mankind
yes
thou
wert
born
to
murder
more
believing
men
than
the
unhappy
and
undone
tell
me
thou
charming
hypocrite
why
hast
thou
thus
deluded
me
why
oh
why
was
i
made
the
miserable
object
of
thy
fatal
what
have
i
done
thou
lovely
fickle
maid
that
thou
shouldst
be
my
murderer
and
why
dost
thou
call
me
from
the
grave
with
such
dear
soft
commands
as
would
awake
the
very
quiet
dead
to
torture
me
anew
after
my
eyes
curse
on
their
fatal
sense
were
too
sure
witnesses
of
thy
infidelity
oh
fickle
maid
how
much
more
kind
it
had
been
to
have
sent
me
down
to
earth
with
plain
truth
than
a
mean
subtle
falsehood
that
has
undone
thy
credit
in
my
soul
truth
though
it
were
cruel
had
been
generous
in
thee
though
thou
wert
perjured
false
forsworn
thou
shouldst
not
have
added
to
it
that
yet
baser
sin
of
treachery
you
might
have
been
provoked
to
have
killed
your
friend
but
it
were
base
to
stab
him
unawares
defenceless
and
unwarned
smile
in
my
face
and
strike
me
to
the
heart
soothe
me
with
all
the
tenderest
marks
of
my
passion
nay
with
an
invitation
too
that
would
have
gained
a
credit
in
one
that
had
been
jilted
over
the
world
flattered
and
ruined
by
all
thy
cozening
sex
and
all
to
send
me
vain
and
pleased
away
only
to
gain
a
day
to
entertain
another
lover
in
oh
fantastic
woman
destructive
glorious
thing
what
needed
this
deceit
hadst
thou
not
with
unwonted
industry
persuaded
me
to
have
hasted
to
by
heaven
i
had
dully
lived
the
tedious
day
in
traversing
the
flowery
meads
and
silent
groves
laid
by
some
murmuring
spring
had
sigh
d
away
the
often
counted
hours
and
thought
on
till
the
blessed
minute
of
my
ravishing
approach
to
her
had
been
a
fond
believing
and
imposed
on
coxcomb
and
never
had
dreamt
the
treachery
never
seen
the
snake
that
basked
beneath
the
gay
the
smiling
flowers
securely
thou
hadst
cozened
me
reaped
the
new
joys
and
made
my
rival
sport
at
the
expense
of
all
my
happiness
yes
yes
your
hasty
importunity
first
gave
me
jealousy
made
me
impatient
with
and
excuse
myself
to
him
by
a
hundred
inventions
neglected
all
to
hasten
back
where
all
my
joys
where
all
my
killing
fears
and
torments
resided
but
when
i
came
how
was
i
welcomed
with
your
confirming
billet
yes
how
let
inform
you
between
whose
arms
i
fell
dead
shame
on
me
dead
and
the
first
thought
my
soul
conceived
when
it
returned
was
not
to
die
in
jest
i
answered
your
commands
and
hastened
to
the
grove
where
by
all
that
is
sacred
by
thyself
i
swear
a
dearer
oath
than
heaven
and
earth
can
furnish
me
with
i
did
resolve
to
die
but
oh
how
soon
my
soft
my
silent
passion
turned
to
loud
rage
rage
easier
to
be
borne
to
dire
despair
to
fury
and
revenge
for
there
i
saw
my
young
my
fair
my
rich
and
powerful
rival
he
hasted
through
the
grove
all
warm
and
glowing
from
the
fair
false
one
s
arms
the
blushes
which
thy
eyes
had
kindled
were
fresh
upon
his
cheeks
his
looks
were
sparkling
with
the
fire
his
heart
so
briskly
burnt
with
a
glad
peaceful
smile
dressed
all
his
face
tricked
like
a
bridegroom
while
he
perfum
d
the
air
as
he
passed
through
it
none
but
the
man
that
loves
and
dotes
like
me
is
able
to
express
my
sense
of
rage
i
quickly
turned
the
sword
from
my
own
heart
to
send
it
to
his
elevated
one
giving
him
only
time
to
draw
that
was
the
word
and
i
confess
your
spark
was
wondrous
ready
brisk
with
success
vain
with
your
favours
he
only
cried
if
be
the
quarrel
i
am
prepared
and
he
maintained
your
cause
with
admirable
courage
i
confess
though
chance
or
fortune
luckily
gave
me
his
sword
which
i
would
fain
have
rendered
back
and
that
way
would
have
died
but
he
refused
to
arm
his
hand
anew
against
the
man
that
had
not
took
advantage
of
him
and
thus
we
parted
then
it
was
that
malice
supported
me
with
life
and
told
me
i
should
scorn
to
die
for
so
perfidious
and
so
ruinous
a
creature
but
charming
and
bewitching
still
it
was
then
i
borrowed
so
much
calmness
of
my
lessening
anger
to
read
the
billet
over
your
page
had
brought
me
which
melted
all
the
rough
remaining
part
of
rage
away
into
tame
languishment
ah
this
heart
of
mine
was
never
formed
by
nature
to
hold
out
long
in
stubborn
sullenness
i
am
already
on
the
excusing
part
and
fain
would
think
thee
innocent
and
just
deceive
me
prettily
i
know
thou
canst
soothe
my
fond
heart
and
ask
how
it
could
harbour
a
faithless
thought
of
do
flatter
me
protest
a
little
swear
my
rival
saw
thee
not
say
he
was
there
by
chance
say
any
thing
or
if
thou
sawest
him
say
with
how
cold
a
look
he
was
received
oh
calm
my
soul
deceive
it
flatter
it
and
i
shall
still
believe
and
love
thee
on
yet
shouldest
thou
tell
me
truth
that
thou
art
false
by
heaven
i
do
adore
thee
so
i
still
should
love
thee
on
should
i
have
seen
thee
clasp
him
in
thy
arms
print
kisses
on
his
cheeks
and
lips
and
more
so
fondly
and
so
dotingly
i
love
i
think
i
should
forgive
thee
for
i
swear
by
all
the
powers
that
pity
frail
mortality
there
is
no
joy
no
life
no
heaven
without
thee
be
false
be
cruel
perjured
infamous
yet
still
i
must
adore
thee
my
soul
was
formed
of
nothing
but
of
love
and
all
that
love
and
all
that
soul
is
but
yet
since
thou
hast
framed
me
an
excuse
be
kind
and
carry
it
on
to
be
deluded
well
as
thou
canst
do
it
will
be
the
same
to
innocence
as
loving
i
shall
not
find
the
cheat
i
will
come
then
and
lay
myself
at
thy
feet
and
seek
there
that
repose
that
dear
content
which
is
not
to
be
found
in
this
vast
world
besides
though
much
of
my
heart
s
joy
thou
hast
abated
and
fixed
a
sadness
in
my
soul
that
will
not
easily
vanish
oh
take
care
of
me
for
i
am
in
thy
power
my
life
my
fame
my
soul
are
all
in
thy
hands
be
tender
of
the
victims
and
remember
if
any
action
of
thy
life
should
shew
a
fading
love
that
very
moment
i
perceive
the
change
you
shall
find
dead
at
your
feet
the
abandoned
philander
as
death
i
am
going
towards
the
meadow
in
order
to
my
approach
sylvia
world
affording
no
repose
to
me
but
when
i
am
where
the
dear
charmer
philander
the
and
can
you
be
jealous
of
me
i
mean
so
poorly
jealous
as
to
believe
me
capable
of
falsehood
of
and
what
is
worse
of
loving
any
thing
but
the
adorable
i
could
not
once
believe
so
cruel
a
thought
could
have
entered
into
the
imaginations
of
a
soul
so
entirely
possessed
with
and
so
great
a
judge
of
love
abandon
me
reproach
me
hate
me
scorn
me
whenever
i
harbour
any
thing
in
mind
so
destructive
to
my
repose
and
thine
can
i
give
you
a
greater
proof
of
my
passion
of
my
faithful
passion
than
being
undone
for
you
have
i
any
other
prospect
in
all
this
soft
adventure
but
shame
dishonour
reproach
eternal
infamy
and
destruction
even
of
soul
and
body
i
tremble
with
fear
of
future
punishment
but
oh
love
will
have
no
devotion
mixed
with
his
ceremonies
to
any
other
deity
and
yet
alas
i
might
have
loved
another
and
have
been
saved
or
any
maid
but
might
have
possessed
without
damnation
but
it
is
a
brother
i
pursue
it
is
a
sister
gives
her
honour
up
and
none
but
that
ever
i
read
in
story
was
ever
found
so
wretched
as
to
love
a
brother
with
so
criminal
a
flame
and
possibly
i
may
meet
her
fate
i
have
a
father
too
as
great
as
as
angry
and
revengeful
where
his
honour
is
concerned
and
you
found
my
dearest
brother
how
near
you
were
last
night
to
a
discovery
in
the
garden
i
have
some
reason
too
to
fear
this
night
s
adventure
for
as
ill
fate
would
have
it
loaded
with
other
thoughts
i
told
not
of
your
adventure
last
night
with
the
count
who
meeting
her
early
this
morning
had
like
to
have
made
a
discovery
if
he
have
not
really
so
already
she
strove
to
shun
him
but
he
cried
out
you
can
not
fly
me
by
light
as
you
did
last
night
in
the
dark
she
turned
and
begged
his
pardon
for
neither
coming
nor
designing
to
come
since
she
had
resolved
never
to
violate
her
vows
to
not
coming
cried
he
not
returning
again
you
meant
secure
of
my
heart
and
my
purse
you
fled
with
whose
honour
was
now
concerned
and
not
reminding
your
escape
in
her
likeness
blushing
she
sharply
denied
the
fact
and
with
a
disdain
that
had
laid
aside
all
respect
left
him
nor
can
it
be
doubted
but
he
fancied
if
she
spoke
truth
there
was
some
other
intrigue
of
love
carried
on
at
judge
my
charming
if
i
have
not
reason
to
be
fearful
of
thy
safety
and
my
fame
and
to
be
jealous
that
so
wise
a
man
as
did
not
take
that
parly
to
be
held
with
a
spirit
last
night
or
that
it
was
an
apparition
he
courted
but
if
there
be
no
boldness
like
that
of
love
nor
courage
like
that
of
a
lover
sure
there
never
was
so
great
a
heroine
as
undaunted
i
resolve
to
stand
the
shock
of
all
since
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
leave
any
doubt
or
jealousy
that
i
can
dissipate
and
heaven
knows
how
far
i
was
from
any
thought
of
seeing
when
i
urged
to
depart
i
have
to
clear
my
innocence
sent
thee
the
letter
i
received
two
hours
after
thy
absence
which
falling
into
my
mother
s
hands
whose
favourite
he
is
he
had
permission
to
make
his
visit
which
within
an
hour
he
did
but
how
received
by
me
be
thou
the
judge
whenever
it
is
thy
fate
to
be
obliged
to
entertain
some
woman
to
whom
thy
soul
has
an
entire
aversion
i
forced
a
complaisance
against
my
nature
endured
his
racking
courtship
with
a
fortitude
that
became
the
great
heart
that
bears
thy
sacred
image
as
martyrs
do
i
suffered
without
murmuring
or
the
least
sign
of
the
pain
i
endured
it
is
below
the
dignity
of
my
mighty
passion
to
justify
it
farther
let
it
plead
its
own
cause
it
has
a
thousand
ways
to
do
it
and
those
all
such
as
can
not
be
resisted
can
not
be
doubted
especially
this
last
proof
of
sacrificing
to
your
repose
the
never
more
to
be
doubted
sylvia
an
hour
hence
i
shall
expect
you
to
the
lady
not
always
the
divine
graces
wherewith
heaven
has
adorned
your
resplendent
beauties
that
can
maintain
the
innumerable
conquests
they
gain
without
a
noble
goodness
which
may
make
you
sensibly
compassionate
the
poor
and
forlorn
captives
you
have
undone
but
most
fair
of
your
sex
it
is
i
alone
that
have
a
destiny
more
cruel
and
severe
and
find
myself
wounded
from
your
very
frowns
and
secured
a
slave
as
well
as
made
one
the
very
scorn
from
those
triumphant
stars
your
eyes
have
the
same
effects
as
if
they
shined
with
the
continual
splendour
of
ravishing
smiles
and
i
can
no
more
shun
their
killing
influence
than
their
aspects
and
i
shall
expire
contentedly
since
i
fall
by
so
glorious
a
fate
if
you
will
vouchsafe
to
pronounce
my
doom
from
that
of
perfection
your
mouth
from
lips
that
open
like
the
blushing
rose
strow
d
over
with
morning
dew
and
from
a
breath
sweeter
than
holy
incense
in
order
to
which
i
approach
you
most
excellent
beauty
with
this
most
humble
petition
that
you
will
deign
to
permit
me
to
throw
my
unworthy
self
before
the
throne
of
your
mercy
there
to
receive
the
sentence
of
my
life
or
death
a
happiness
though
incomparably
too
great
for
so
mean
a
vassal
yet
with
that
reverence
and
awe
i
shall
receive
it
as
i
would
the
sentence
of
the
gods
and
which
i
will
no
more
resist
than
i
would
the
thunderbolts
of
or
the
revenge
of
angry
for
madam
my
immense
passion
knows
no
medium
between
life
and
death
and
as
i
never
had
the
presumption
to
aspire
to
the
glory
of
the
first
i
am
not
so
abject
as
to
fear
i
am
wholly
deprived
of
the
glory
of
the
last
i
have
too
long
lain
convicted
extend
your
mercy
and
put
me
now
out
of
pain
you
have
often
wrecked
me
to
confess
my
promethean
sin
spare
the
cruel
vulture
of
despair
take
him
from
my
heart
in
pity
and
either
by
killing
words
or
blasting
lightning
from
those
refulgent
eyes
pronounce
the
death
of
admiring
foscario
sylvia
everlasting
i
am
convinc
d
and
pleas
d
my
fears
are
vanish
d
and
a
heaven
of
solid
joy
is
opened
to
my
view
and
i
have
nothing
now
in
prospect
but
glittering
youth
dazzling
beauty
charming
sounds
and
ravishing
touches
and
all
around
me
ecstasies
of
pleasure
inconceivable
transports
without
conclusion
never
fancied
such
a
heaven
not
all
his
paradise
promised
such
lasting
felicity
or
ever
provided
there
the
recompense
of
such
a
maid
as
such
a
bewitching
form
such
soft
such
glorious
eyes
where
the
soul
speaks
and
dances
and
betrays
love
s
secrets
in
every
killing
glance
a
face
where
every
motion
every
feature
sweetly
languishes
a
neck
all
tempting
and
her
lovely
breast
inviting
presses
from
the
eager
lips
such
hands
such
clasping
arms
so
white
so
soft
and
slender
no
nor
one
of
all
his
heavenly
enjoyments
though
promised
years
of
fainting
in
one
continued
ecstasy
can
make
one
moment
s
joy
with
charming
oh
i
am
wrapt
with
bare
imagination
with
a
much
vaster
pleasure
than
any
other
dull
appointment
can
dispense
oh
thou
blessing
sent
from
heaven
to
ease
my
toils
of
life
thou
sacred
dear
delight
of
my
fond
doting
heart
oh
whither
wilt
thou
lead
me
to
what
vast
heights
of
love
into
extremes
as
fatal
and
as
dangerous
as
those
excesses
were
that
rendered
me
so
cold
in
your
opinion
oh
have
a
care
of
me
manage
my
overjoyed
soul
and
all
its
eager
passions
chide
my
fond
heart
be
angry
if
i
faint
upon
thy
bosom
and
do
not
with
thy
tender
voice
recall
me
a
voice
that
kills
and
calls
my
fleeting
soul
out
of
its
habitation
lay
not
such
charming
lips
to
my
cold
cheeks
but
let
me
lie
extended
at
thy
feet
untouched
unsighed
upon
unpressed
with
kisses
oh
change
those
tender
trembling
words
of
love
into
rough
sounds
and
noises
unconcerned
and
when
you
see
me
dying
do
not
call
my
soul
to
mingle
with
thy
sighs
yet
shouldst
thou
abate
one
word
one
look
or
tear
by
heaven
i
should
be
mad
oh
never
let
me
live
to
see
declension
in
thy
love
no
no
my
charmer
i
can
not
bear
the
least
supposed
decay
in
those
dear
fondnesses
of
thine
and
sure
none
ever
became
a
maid
so
well
nor
ever
were
received
with
adorations
like
to
mine
pardon
my
adorable
the
rashness
of
my
passion
in
this
rencounter
with
i
am
satisfied
he
is
too
unhappy
in
your
disfavour
to
merit
the
being
so
in
mine
but
it
was
sufficient
i
then
saw
a
joy
in
his
face
a
pleased
gaiety
in
his
looks
to
make
me
think
my
rage
reasonable
and
my
quarrel
just
by
the
style
he
writes
i
dread
his
sense
less
than
his
person
but
you
my
lovely
maid
have
said
enough
to
quit
me
of
my
fears
for
both
the
night
comes
on
i
can
not
call
it
envious
though
it
rob
me
of
the
light
that
should
assist
me
to
finish
this
since
it
will
more
gloriously
repay
me
in
a
happier
place
come
on
then
thou
blest
retreat
of
lovers
i
forgive
by
interruptions
here
since
thou
wilt
conduct
to
the
arms
of
the
adoring
philander
you
have
any
commands
for
me
this
weeder
of
the
gardens
whom
i
met
in
going
in
thither
will
bring
it
back
i
wait
in
the
meadow
and
date
this
from
the
dear
where
i
have
sat
sylvia
philander
the
happy
done
yes
it
is
done
and
after
that
what
will
not
love
and
grief
oblige
me
to
own
to
you
oh
by
what
insensible
degrees
a
maid
in
love
may
arrive
to
say
any
thing
to
her
lover
without
blushing
i
have
known
the
time
the
blest
innocent
time
when
but
to
think
i
loved
would
have
covered
my
face
with
shame
and
to
have
spoke
it
would
have
filled
me
with
confusion
have
made
me
tremble
blush
and
bend
my
guilty
eyes
to
earth
not
daring
to
behold
my
charming
conqueror
while
i
made
that
bashful
confession
though
now
i
am
grown
bold
in
love
yet
i
have
known
the
time
when
being
at
court
and
coming
from
the
presence
being
offered
some
officious
hand
to
lead
me
to
my
coach
i
have
shrunk
back
with
my
aversion
to
your
sex
and
have
concealed
my
hands
in
my
pockets
to
prevent
their
being
touched
kiss
would
turn
my
stomach
and
amorous
looks
though
they
would
make
me
vain
gave
me
a
hate
to
him
that
sent
them
and
never
any
maid
resolved
so
much
as
i
to
tread
the
paths
of
honour
and
i
had
many
precedents
before
me
to
make
me
careful
thus
i
was
armed
with
resolution
pride
and
scorn
against
all
mankind
but
alas
i
made
no
defence
against
a
brother
but
innocently
lay
exposed
to
all
his
attacks
of
love
and
never
thought
it
criminal
till
it
kindled
a
new
desire
about
me
oh
that
i
should
not
die
with
shame
to
own
it
yet
see
i
say
how
from
one
soft
degree
to
another
i
do
not
only
confess
the
shameful
truth
but
act
it
too
what
with
a
brother
oh
heavens
a
crime
so
monstrous
and
so
new
but
by
all
thy
love
by
those
surprising
joys
so
lately
experienced
i
never
will
no
no
i
never
can
repent
it
oh
incorrigible
passion
oh
harden
d
love
at
least
i
might
have
some
remorse
some
sighing
after
my
poor
departed
honour
but
why
should
i
dissemble
with
the
powers
divine
that
know
the
secrets
of
a
soul
doomed
to
eternal
love
yet
i
am
mad
i
rave
and
tear
myself
traverse
my
guilty
chamber
in
a
disordered
but
a
soft
confusion
and
often
opening
the
conscious
curtains
survey
the
print
where
thou
and
i
were
last
night
laid
surveying
it
with
a
thousand
tender
sighs
and
kiss
and
press
thy
dear
forsaken
side
imagine
over
all
our
solemn
joys
every
dear
transport
all
our
ravishing
repeated
blisses
then
almost
fainting
languishing
cry
oh
my
charming
little
god
then
lay
me
down
in
the
dear
place
you
pressed
still
warm
and
fragrant
with
the
sweet
remains
that
thou
hast
left
behind
thee
on
the
pillow
oh
my
soul
s
joy
my
dear
eternal
pleasure
what
softness
hast
thou
added
to
my
heart
within
a
few
hours
but
oh
if
as
i
ve
oft
been
told
possession
which
makes
women
fond
and
doting
should
make
thee
cold
and
grow
indifferent
if
nauseated
with
repeated
joy
and
having
made
a
full
discovery
of
all
that
was
but
once
imaginary
when
fancy
rendered
every
thing
much
finer
than
experience
oh
how
were
i
undone
for
me
by
all
the
inhabitants
of
heaven
i
swear
by
thy
dear
charming
self
and
by
thy
vows
thou
so
transcendest
all
fancy
all
dull
imagination
all
wondering
ideas
of
what
man
was
to
me
that
i
believe
thee
more
than
human
some
charm
divine
dwells
in
thy
touches
besides
all
these
thy
charming
look
thy
love
the
beauties
that
adorn
thee
and
thy
wit
i
swear
there
is
a
secret
in
nature
that
renders
thee
more
dear
and
fits
thee
to
my
soul
do
not
ask
it
me
let
it
suffice
it
is
so
and
is
not
to
be
told
yes
by
it
i
know
thou
art
the
man
created
for
my
soul
and
he
alone
that
has
the
power
to
touch
it
my
eyes
and
fancy
might
have
been
diverted
i
might
have
favoured
this
above
the
other
preferred
that
face
that
wit
or
shape
or
air
but
to
concern
my
soul
to
make
that
capable
of
something
more
than
love
it
was
only
necessary
that
should
be
formed
and
formed
just
as
he
is
that
shape
that
face
that
height
that
dear
proportion
i
would
not
have
a
feature
not
a
look
not
a
hair
altered
just
as
thou
art
thou
art
an
angel
to
me
and
i
without
considering
what
i
am
what
i
might
be
or
ought
without
considering
the
fatal
circumstances
of
thy
being
married
a
thought
that
shocks
my
soul
whenever
it
enters
or
whatever
other
thought
that
does
concern
my
happiness
or
quiet
have
fixed
my
soul
to
love
and
my
to
love
thee
with
all
thy
disadvantages
and
glory
in
my
ruin
these
are
my
firm
resolves
these
are
my
thoughts
but
thou
art
gone
with
all
the
trophies
of
my
love
and
honour
gay
with
the
spoils
which
now
perhaps
are
unregarded
the
mystery
is
now
revealed
the
mighty
secret
is
known
and
now
will
be
no
wonder
or
surprise
but
hear
my
vows
by
all
on
which
my
life
depends
i
swear
if
ever
i
perceive
the
least
decay
of
love
in
thee
if
ever
thou
breakest
an
oath
a
vow
a
word
if
ever
i
see
repentance
in
thy
face
a
coldness
in
thy
eyes
which
heaven
divert
by
that
bright
heaven
i
will
die
you
may
believe
me
since
i
had
the
courage
and
durst
love
thee
and
after
that
durst
sacrifice
my
fame
lose
all
to
justify
that
love
will
when
a
change
so
fatal
shall
arrive
find
courage
too
to
die
yes
die
assure
thyself
i
will
and
therefore
have
a
care
of
sylvia
philander
oh
where
shall
i
find
repose
where
seek
a
silent
quiet
but
in
my
last
retreat
the
grave
i
say
not
this
my
dearest
that
i
do
or
ever
can
repent
my
love
though
the
fatal
source
of
all
for
already
we
are
betrayed
our
race
of
joys
our
course
of
stolen
delight
is
ended
ere
begun
i
chid
alas
at
morning
s
dawn
i
chid
you
to
be
gone
and
yet
heaven
knows
i
grasped
you
fast
and
rather
would
have
died
than
parted
with
you
i
saw
the
day
come
on
and
cursed
its
busy
light
and
still
you
cried
one
blessed
minute
more
before
i
part
with
all
the
joys
of
life
and
hours
were
minutes
then
and
day
grew
old
upon
us
unawares
it
was
all
abroad
and
had
called
up
all
the
household
spies
to
pry
into
the
secrets
of
our
loves
and
thou
by
some
flatterer
were
seen
in
passing
through
the
garden
the
news
was
carried
to
my
father
and
a
mighty
consult
has
been
held
in
my
mother
s
apartment
who
now
refuses
to
see
me
while
i
possessed
with
love
and
full
of
wonder
at
my
new
change
lulled
with
dear
contemplation
for
i
am
altered
much
since
yesterday
however
thou
hast
charmed
me
imagining
none
knew
our
theft
of
love
but
only
heaven
and
but
oh
alas
i
had
no
sooner
finished
this
enclosed
but
my
father
entered
my
cabinet
but
it
was
with
such
a
look
as
soon
informed
me
all
was
betrayed
to
him
a
while
he
gazed
on
me
with
fierceness
in
his
eyes
which
so
surprised
and
frighted
me
that
i
all
pale
and
trembling
threw
myself
at
his
feet
he
seeing
my
disorder
took
me
up
and
fixed
so
steadfast
and
so
sad
a
look
upon
me
as
would
have
broken
any
heart
but
mine
supported
with
image
i
sighed
and
wept
and
silently
attended
when
the
storm
should
fall
which
turned
into
a
shower
so
soft
and
piercing
i
almost
died
to
see
it
at
last
delivering
me
a
paper
here
cried
he
with
a
sigh
and
voice
what
i
can
not
tell
thee
oh
cried
he
thou
joy
and
hope
of
all
my
aged
years
thou
object
of
my
dotage
how
hast
thou
brought
me
to
my
grave
with
sorrow
so
left
me
with
the
paper
in
my
hand
speechless
unmov
d
a
while
i
stood
till
he
awaked
me
by
new
sighs
and
cries
for
passing
through
my
chamber
by
chance
or
by
design
he
cast
his
melancholy
eyes
towards
my
bed
and
saw
the
dear
disorder
there
unusual
then
cried
oh
wretched
thou
art
lost
and
left
me
almost
fainting
the
letter
i
soon
found
was
one
you
d
sent
from
his
farm
this
morning
after
you
had
parted
from
me
which
has
betrayed
us
all
but
how
it
came
into
their
hands
i
since
have
understood
for
as
i
said
you
were
seen
passing
through
the
garden
from
thence
to
be
confirmed
they
dogged
you
to
the
farm
and
waiting
there
your
motions
saw
come
forth
with
a
letter
in
his
hand
which
though
he
soon
concealed
yet
not
so
soon
but
it
was
taken
notice
of
when
hastening
to
the
nearest
way
they
gave
an
account
to
my
father
who
going
out
to
commanded
him
to
deliver
him
the
letter
his
vassal
durst
not
disobey
but
yielded
it
with
such
dispute
and
reluctancy
as
he
durst
maintain
with
a
man
so
great
and
powerful
before
returned
you
had
taken
horse
so
that
you
are
a
stranger
to
our
misfortune
what
shall
i
do
where
shall
i
seek
a
refuge
from
the
danger
that
threatens
us
a
sad
and
silent
grief
appears
throughout
and
the
face
of
all
things
is
changed
yet
none
knows
the
unhappy
cause
but
my
father
and
my
mother
and
myself
and
my
page
are
both
dismissed
from
waiting
on
me
as
supposed
confidants
of
this
dear
secret
and
strangers
creatures
of
the
countess
put
about
me
oh
what
can
i
do
thy
advice
or
i
am
lost
but
how
alas
shall
i
either
convey
these
to
thee
or
receive
any
thing
from
thee
unless
some
god
of
love
in
pity
of
our
miseries
should
offer
us
his
aid
i
will
try
to
corrupt
my
new
boy
i
see
good
nature
pity
and
generosity
in
his
looks
he
is
well
born
too
and
may
be
honest
thus
far
i
had
writ
when
supper
was
brought
me
for
yet
my
parents
have
not
deigned
to
let
me
come
into
their
presence
those
that
serve
me
tell
me
is
this
afternoon
arrived
at
all
is
mighty
close
carried
in
the
countess
s
apartment
i
tremble
with
the
thought
of
what
will
be
the
result
of
the
great
consultation
i
have
been
tempting
of
the
boy
but
i
perceive
they
have
strictly
charged
him
not
to
obey
me
he
says
against
his
will
he
shall
betray
me
for
they
will
have
him
searched
but
he
has
promised
me
to
see
one
of
the
weeders
who
working
in
the
garden
into
which
my
window
opens
may
from
thence
receive
what
i
shall
let
down
if
it
be
true
i
shall
get
this
fatal
knowledge
to
you
that
you
may
not
only
prepare
for
the
worst
but
contrive
to
set
at
liberty
sylvia
heart
is
ready
to
break
and
my
eyes
are
drowned
in
tears
philander
much
unlike
the
last
will
this
fatal
night
prove
farewell
and
think
sylvia
was
writ
in
the
cover
to
both
the
foregoing
letters
philander
philander
all
that
i
dreaded
all
that
i
feared
is
fallen
upon
me
i
have
been
arraigned
and
convicted
three
judges
severe
as
the
three
infernal
ones
sat
in
condemnation
on
me
a
father
a
mother
and
a
sister
the
fact
alas
was
too
clearly
proved
and
too
many
circumstantial
truths
appeared
against
me
for
me
to
plead
not
guilty
but
oh
heavens
had
you
seen
the
tears
and
heard
the
prayers
threats
reproaches
and
upbraidings
these
from
an
injured
sister
those
my
heartbroken
parents
a
tender
mother
here
a
railing
and
reviling
sister
there
an
angry
father
and
a
guilty
conscience
thou
wouldst
have
wondered
at
my
fortitude
my
courage
and
my
resolution
and
all
from
love
for
surely
i
had
died
had
not
thy
love
thy
powerful
love
supported
me
through
all
the
accidents
of
life
and
fate
that
can
and
will
support
me
in
the
midst
of
all
their
clamours
and
their
railings
i
had
from
that
a
secret
and
soft
repose
within
that
whispered
me
loves
me
still
discarded
and
renounced
by
my
fond
parents
love
still
replies
still
will
own
thee
thrown
from
thy
mother
s
and
thy
sister
s
arms
still
are
open
to
receive
thee
and
though
i
rave
and
almost
die
to
see
them
grieve
to
think
that
i
am
the
fatal
cause
who
makes
so
sad
confusion
in
our
family
for
oh
tis
piteous
to
behold
my
sister
s
sighs
and
tears
my
mother
s
sad
despair
my
father
s
raging
and
his
weeping
by
melancholy
turns
yet
even
these
deplorable
objects
that
would
move
the
most
obdurate
stubborn
heart
to
pity
and
repentance
render
not
mine
relenting
and
yet
i
am
wondrous
pitiful
by
nature
and
i
can
weep
and
faint
to
see
the
sad
effects
of
my
loose
wanton
love
yet
can
not
find
repentance
for
the
dear
charming
sin
and
yet
should
st
thou
behold
my
mother
s
languishment
no
bitter
words
proceeding
from
her
lips
no
tears
fall
from
her
downcast
eyes
but
silent
and
sad
as
death
she
sits
and
will
not
view
the
light
should
st
thou
i
say
behold
it
thou
would
st
if
not
repent
yet
grieve
that
thou
hadst
loved
me
sure
love
has
quite
confounded
nature
in
me
i
could
not
else
behold
this
fatal
ruin
without
revenging
it
upon
my
stubborn
heart
a
thousand
times
a
day
i
make
new
vows
against
the
god
of
love
but
it
is
too
late
and
i
am
as
often
perjured
oh
should
the
gods
revenge
the
broken
vows
of
lovers
what
man
what
maid
betrayed
like
me
but
would
be
damned
a
thousand
times
for
every
little
every
kind
resentment
makes
us
swear
to
love
no
more
and
every
smile
and
every
flattering
softness
from
the
dear
injurer
makes
us
perjured
let
all
the
force
of
virtue
honour
interest
join
with
my
suffering
parents
to
persuade
me
to
cease
to
love
yet
let
him
but
appear
let
him
but
look
on
me
with
those
dear
charming
eyes
let
him
but
sigh
or
press
me
to
his
fragrant
cheek
fold
me
and
cry
ah
can
you
quit
me
nay
you
must
not
you
shall
not
nay
i
know
you
can
not
remember
you
are
mine
there
is
such
eloquence
in
those
dear
words
when
uttered
with
a
voice
so
tender
and
so
passionate
that
i
believe
them
irresistible
alas
i
find
them
so
and
easily
break
all
the
feebler
vows
i
make
against
thee
yes
i
must
be
undone
perjured
forsworn
incorrigible
unnatural
disobedient
and
any
thing
rather
than
not
turn
then
my
soul
from
these
domestic
melancholy
objects
and
look
abroad
look
forward
for
a
while
on
charming
prospects
look
on
the
dear
the
young
the
amorous
whose
very
looks
infuse
a
tender
joy
throughout
the
soul
and
chase
all
cares
all
sorrows
and
anxious
thoughts
from
thence
whose
wanton
play
is
softer
i
than
that
of
angels
and
when
he
looks
and
sighs
and
speaks
and
touches
he
is
a
very
god
where
art
thou
oh
miracle
of
youth
thou
charming
dear
undoer
now
thou
hast
gained
the
glory
of
the
conquest
thou
slightest
the
rifled
captive
what
not
a
line
two
tedious
days
are
past
and
no
kind
power
relieves
me
with
a
word
or
any
tidings
of
and
yet
thou
mayest
have
sent
but
i
shall
never
see
it
till
they
raise
up
fresh
witnesses
against
me
i
can
not
think
thee
wavering
or
forgetful
for
if
i
did
surely
thou
knowest
my
heart
so
well
thou
canst
not
think
it
would
live
to
think
another
thought
confirm
my
kind
belief
and
send
to
me
there
is
a
gate
well
known
to
thee
through
which
thou
passest
to
it
is
in
the
road
about
half
a
league
from
hence
an
old
man
opens
it
his
daughter
weeds
in
the
garden
and
will
convey
this
to
thee
as
i
have
ordered
her
by
the
same
messenger
thou
mayest
return
thine
and
early
as
she
comes
i
ll
let
her
down
a
string
by
which
way
unperceived
i
shall
receive
them
from
her
i
will
say
no
more
nor
instruct
you
how
you
shall
preserve
your
sylvia
sylvia
which
was
left
in
her
hands
monsieur
father
in
her
sylvia
i
can
no
more
describe
to
thee
the
torment
with
which
i
part
from
than
i
can
that
heaven
of
joy
i
was
raised
to
last
night
by
the
transporting
effects
of
thy
wondrous
love
both
are
to
excess
and
both
killing
but
in
different
kinds
oh
by
all
my
unspeakable
raptures
in
thy
arms
by
all
thy
charms
of
beauty
too
numerous
and
too
ravishing
for
fancy
to
imagine
i
swear
by
this
last
night
by
this
dear
new
discovery
thou
hast
increased
my
love
to
that
vast
height
it
has
undone
my
peace
all
my
repose
is
gone
this
dear
dear
night
has
ruined
me
it
has
confirmed
me
now
i
must
have
and
can
not
live
without
her
no
not
a
day
an
hour
to
save
the
world
unless
i
had
the
entire
possession
of
my
lovely
maid
ah
i
am
not
that
indifferent
dull
lover
that
can
be
raised
by
one
beauty
to
an
appetite
and
satisfy
it
with
another
i
can
not
carry
the
dear
flame
you
kindle
to
quench
it
in
the
embraces
of
no
by
the
eternal
powers
he
that
pretends
to
love
and
loves
at
that
coarse
rate
needs
fear
no
danger
from
that
passion
he
never
was
born
to
love
or
die
for
love
and
a
thousand
more
were
all
the
same
to
such
a
dull
insensible
no
when
you
find
i
can
return
back
to
the
once
left
matrimonial
bed
despise
me
scorn
me
swear
as
then
thou
justly
may
st
i
love
not
let
the
hot
brute
drudge
on
he
who
is
fired
by
nature
not
by
love
whom
any
body
s
kisses
can
inspire
and
ease
the
necessary
heats
of
youth
love
is
a
nobler
fire
which
nothing
can
allay
but
the
dear
she
that
raised
it
no
no
my
purer
stream
shall
never
run
back
to
the
fountain
whence
it
is
parted
nay
it
can
not
it
were
as
possible
to
love
again
where
one
has
ceased
to
love
as
carry
the
desire
and
wishes
back
by
heaven
to
me
there
is
nothing
so
unnatural
no
it
is
you
i
must
possess
you
have
completed
my
undoing
now
and
i
must
die
unless
you
give
me
all
but
oh
i
am
going
from
thee
when
are
we
like
to
meet
oh
how
shall
i
support
my
absent
hours
thought
will
destroy
me
for
it
will
be
all
on
thee
and
those
at
such
a
distance
will
be
what
shall
i
do
without
thee
if
after
all
the
toils
of
dull
insipid
life
i
could
return
and
lay
me
down
by
thee
labours
would
be
soft
and
easy
the
harsh
fatigues
of
war
the
dangerous
hurries
of
affairs
of
state
the
business
and
the
noise
of
life
i
could
support
with
pleasure
with
wondrous
satisfaction
could
treat
too
with
that
respect
that
generous
care
as
would
become
a
husband
i
could
be
easy
every
where
and
every
one
should
be
at
ease
with
me
now
i
shall
go
and
find
no
there
but
sigh
and
wander
like
an
unknown
thing
on
some
strange
foreign
shore
i
shall
grow
peevish
as
a
new
wean
d
child
no
toys
no
bauble
of
the
gaudy
world
will
please
my
wayward
fancy
i
shall
be
out
of
humour
rail
at
every
thing
in
anger
shall
demand
and
sullenly
reply
to
every
question
asked
and
answered
and
when
i
think
to
ease
my
soul
by
a
retreat
a
thousand
soft
desires
a
thousand
wishes
wreck
me
pain
me
to
raving
till
beating
the
senseless
floor
with
my
feet
i
cried
aloud
my
thus
thus
my
charming
dear
the
poor
is
employed
when
banished
from
his
heaven
if
thus
it
used
to
be
when
only
that
bright
outside
was
adored
judge
now
my
pain
now
thou
hast
made
known
a
thousand
graces
more
oh
pity
me
for
it
is
not
in
thy
power
to
guess
what
i
shall
now
endure
in
absence
of
thee
for
thou
hast
charmed
my
soul
to
an
excess
too
mighty
for
a
patient
suffering
alas
i
die
already
i
am
yet
at
his
farm
lingering
on
from
one
swift
minute
to
the
other
and
have
not
power
to
go
a
thousand
looks
all
languishing
i
ve
cast
from
eyes
all
drowned
in
tears
towards
have
sighed
a
thousand
wishes
to
my
angel
from
a
sad
breaking
heart
love
will
not
let
me
go
and
honour
calls
me
alas
i
must
away
when
shall
we
meet
again
ah
when
my
oh
charming
maid
thou
lt
see
me
shortly
dead
for
thus
i
can
not
live
thou
must
be
mine
or
i
must
be
no
more
i
must
away
farewell
may
all
the
softest
joys
of
heaven
attend
thee
adieu
fail
not
to
send
a
hundred
times
a
day
if
possible
i
ve
ordered
to
do
nothing
but
wait
for
all
that
comes
and
post
away
with
what
thou
sendest
to
me
again
adieu
think
on
me
and
till
thou
callest
me
to
thee
imagine
nothing
upon
earth
so
wretched
as
own
philander
my
angel
that
passing
through
the
garden
this
morning
i
erasto
fear
he
saw
me
near
enough
to
know
me
and
will
give
an
account
of
it
let
me
know
what
happens
adieu
half
dead
just
taking
horse
to
go
sylvia
philander
in
a
leaf
of
a
i
have
only
time
to
say
on
thursday
i
am
destined
a
sacrifice
to
which
day
finishes
the
life
of
sylvia
dorillus
raving
and
mad
at
the
news
your
billet
brought
me
i
without
considering
the
effects
that
would
follow
am
arrived
at
i
have
yet
so
much
patience
about
me
to
suffer
myself
to
be
concealed
at
his
cottage
but
if
i
see
thee
not
or
find
no
hopes
of
it
by
heaven
i
ll
set
bellfont
all
in
a
flame
but
i
will
have
my
be
sure
i
ll
do
it
what
to
be
married
sylvia
to
be
married
and
given
from
oh
never
think
it
forsworn
fair
creature
what
give
that
dear
charming
body
shall
he
be
grasped
in
those
dear
naked
arms
taste
all
thy
kisses
press
thy
snowy
breasts
command
thy
joys
and
rifle
all
thy
heaven
furies
and
hell
environ
me
if

sylvia
faithless
perjured
charming
and
canst
thou
suffer
it
hear
my
vows
oh
fickle
angel
hear
me
thou
faithless
ravisher
that
fatal
moment
that
the
daring
priest
offers
to
join
your
hands
and
give
thee
from
me
i
will
sacrifice
your
lover
by
heaven
i
will
before
the
altar
stab
him
at
your
feet
the
holy
place
nor
the
numbers
that
attend
ye
nor
all
your
prayers
nor
tears
shall
save
his
heart
look
to
it
and
be
not
false
yet
i
ll
trust
not
thy
faith
no
she
that
can
think
but
falsely
and
she
that
can
so
easily
be
perjured
for
but
to
suffer
it
is
such
a
sin
such
an
undoing
sin
that
thou
art
surely
damned
and
yet
by
heaven
that
is
not
all
the
ruin
shall
attend
thee
no
lovely
mischief
no
you
shall
not
escape
till
the
damnation
day
for
i
will
rack
thee
torture
thee
and
plague
thee
those
few
hours
i
have
to
live
if
spiteful
fate
prevent
my
just
revenge
upon
and
when
i
am
dead
as
i
shall
quickly
be
killed
by
thy
cruelty
know
thou
fair
murderer
i
will
haunt
thy
sight
be
ever
with
thee
and
surround
thy
bed
and
fright
thee
from
the
ravisher
fright
all
thy
loose
delights
and
check
thy
joys
oh
i
am
mad
i
can
not
think
that
thought
no
thou
shalt
never
advance
so
far
in
wickedness
i
will
save
thee
if
i
can
oh
my
adorable
why
dost
thou
torture
me
how
hast
thou
sworn
so
often
and
so
loud
that
heaven
i
am
sure
has
heard
thee
and
will
punish
thee
how
didst
thou
swear
that
happy
blessed
night
in
which
i
saw
thee
last
clasped
in
my
arms
weeping
with
eager
love
with
melting
softness
on
my
bosom
remember
how
thou
swor
st
oh
that
dear
night
let
me
recover
strength
and
then
i
will
tell
thee
more
i
must
repeat
the
story
of
that
night
which
thou
perhaps
oh
faithless
hast
forgot
that
glorious
night
when
all
the
heavens
were
gay
and
every
favouring
power
looked
down
and
smiled
upon
our
thefts
of
love
that
gloomy
night
the
first
of
all
my
joys
the
blessedest
of
my
life
trembling
and
fainting
i
approach
your
chamber
and
while
you
met
and
grasped
me
at
the
door
taking
my
trembling
body
in
your
how
i
fainted
at
your
feet
and
what
dear
arts
you
used
to
call
me
back
to
life
remember
how
you
kissed
and
pressed
my
face
remember
what
dear
charming
words
you
spoke
and
when
i
did
recover
how
i
asked
you
with
a
feeble
doubtful
voice
ah
will
you
still
continue
thus
thus
wondrous
soft
and
fond
will
you
be
ever
mine
and
ever
true
what
did
you
then
reply
when
kneeling
on
the
carpet
where
i
lay
what
did
you
vow
how
invoke
heaven
how
call
its
vengeance
down
if
ever
you
loved
another
man
again
if
ever
you
touched
or
smiled
on
any
other
if
ever
you
suffered
words
or
acts
of
love
but
from
both
heaven
and
hell
thou
didst
awaken
with
thy
oaths
one
was
an
angry
listener
to
what
it
knew
thou
dst
break
the
other
laughed
to
know
thou
would
st
be
perjured
while
only
i
poor
i
was
all
the
while
a
silent
fond
believer
your
vows
stopped
all
my
language
as
your
kisses
did
my
lips
you
swore
and
kissed
and
vowed
and
clasped
my
neck
oh
charming
flatterer
oh
artful
dear
beguiler
thus
into
life
and
peace
and
fond
security
you
charmed
my
willing
soul
it
was
then
my
certain
of
your
heart
and
that
it
never
could
be
given
away
to
any
other
i
pressed
my
eager
joys
but
with
such
tender
caution
such
fear
and
fondness
such
an
awful
passion
as
overcame
your
faint
resistance
my
reasons
and
my
arguments
were
strong
for
you
were
mine
by
love
by
sacred
vows
and
who
could
lay
a
better
claim
to
how
oft
i
cried
why
this
resistance
my
charming
dear
whose
are
you
not
and
shall
not
command
his
own
you
must
ah
cruel
then
a
soft
struggle
followed
with
words
with
sighs
and
trembling
hearts
and
now
and
then
ah
cruel
and
unreasonable
was
softly
said
on
both
sides
thus
strove
thus
argued
till
both
lay
panting
in
each
other
s
arms
not
with
the
toil
but
rapture
i
need
not
say
what
followed
after
this
what
tender
showers
of
strange
endearing
mixtures
twixt
joy
and
shame
twixt
love
and
new
surprise
and
ever
when
i
dried
your
eyes
with
kisses
unable
to
repeat
any
other
language
than
oh
my
oh
my
charming
angel
while
sighs
of
joy
and
close
grasping
thee
spoke
all
the
rest
while
every
tender
word
and
every
sigh
was
echoed
back
by
thee
you
pressed
me
and
you
vowed
you
loved
me
more
than
ever
yet
you
did
then
swore
anew
and
in
my
bosom
hid
your
charming
blushing
face
then
with
excess
of
love
would
call
on
heaven
be
witness
oh
ye
powers
a
thousand
times
ye
cried
if
ever
maid
e
er
loved
like
punish
me
strangely
oh
eternal
powers
if
ever
i
leave
if
ever
i
cease
to
love
him
no
force
no
art
not
interest
honour
wealth
convenience
duty
or
what
other
necessary
cause
shall
ever
be
of
force
to
make
me
leave
thee
thus
hast
thou
sworn
oh
charming
faithless
flatterer
thus
betwixt
each
ravishing
minute
thou
would
st
swear
and
i
as
fast
believed
and
loved
thee
more
hast
thou
forgot
it
all
oh
fickle
charmer
hast
thou
hast
thou
forgot
between
each
awful
ceremony
of
love
how
you
cried
out
farewell
the
world
and
mortal
cares
give
me
heaven
i
ask
no
more
hast
thou
forgot
all
this
did
all
the
night
hear
any
other
sound
but
those
our
mutual
vows
of
invocations
broken
sighs
and
soft
and
trembling
whispers
say
had
we
any
other
business
for
the
tender
hours
oh

host
of
heaven

faithless
lovely
maid

how
she
is
perjur

ye
injured
powers

since
by
it
she
has
undone
the
faithfullest
youth
and

the
tenderest
heart

a
sacrifice
to
love
and

ye
little
weeping

murdered
victim

philander

leaves
of

on
my
how
dearly
welcome
and
how
needless
were
thy
kind
reproaches
which
i
will
not
endeavour
to
convince
by
argument
but
such
a
deed
as
shall
at
once
secure
thy
fears
now
and
for
the
future
i
have
not
a
minute
to
write
in
place
my
dear
your
chariot
in
st
wood
and
since
i
am
not
able
to
fix
the
hour
of
my
flight

it
wait
there
my
coming

is
but
a
little
mile
from

thyself
to
the
cottage
there
i

call
on
thee
twas
lucky
that

my
flight

farewell
i
leave
you
all
to
follow
my
haste
the
chariot
to
the
thickest
part
of
the
wood
for
i
am
impatient
to
be
gone
and
shall
take
the
first
opportunity
to
fly
to
my
oh
love

love
me
love
me
pretence
of
reaching
the
jessamine
which
shades
my
window

down
and
receive
what
letters

send
by
the
honest
weeder

her

your
sense
of
my
flight
or
rather
your
direction
for
it
is
resolved
sylvia
lovely
so
careful
i
will
be
of
this
dear
mighty
secret
that
i
will
only
say
shall
be
obeyed
no
more
nay
i
ll
not
dare
to
think
of
it
lest
in
my
rapture
i
should
name
my
joy
aloud
and
busy
winds
should
bear
it
to
some
officious
listener
and
undo
me
no
more
no
more
my
extremes
of
joy
as
grief
are
ever
dumb
let
it
suffice
this
blessing
which
you
proffer
i
had
designed
to
ask
as
soon
as
you
d
convinced
me
of
your
faith
yes
i
had
asked
it
though
it
was
a
bounty
too
great
for
any
mortal
to
conceive
heaven
should
bestow
upon
him
but
if
it
do
that
very
moment
i
ll
resign
the
world
and
barter
all
for
love
and
charming
haste
haste
my
life
my
arms
my
bosom
and
my
soul
are
open
to
receive
the
lovely
fugitive
haste
for
this
moment
i
am
going
to
plant
myself
where
you
directed
philander
her
ah
how
have
you
undone
a
harmless
poor
unfortunate
alas
where
are
you
why
would
you
thus
abandon
me
is
this
the
soul
the
bosom
these
the
arms
that
should
receive
me
i
ll
not
upbraid
thee
with
my
love
or
charge
thee
with
my
undoing
it
was
all
my
own
and
were
it
yet
to
do
i
should
again
be
ruined
for
and
never
find
repentance
no
not
for
a
thought
a
word
or
deed
of
love
to
the
dear
false
forsworn
but
i
can
die
yes
hopeless
friendless
left
by
all
even
by
all
but
resolution
has
abandoned
me
and
that
can
lay
me
down
whenever
i
please
in
safe
repose
and
peace
but
oh
thou
art
not
false
or
if
thou
be
st
oh
let
me
hear
it
from
thy
mouth
see
thy
repented
love
that
i
may
know
there
is
no
such
thing
on
earth
as
faith
as
honesty
as
love
or
truth
however
be
thou
true
or
be
thou
false
be
bold
and
let
me
know
it
for
thus
to
doubt
is
torture
worse
than
death
what
accident
thou
dear
dear
man
has
happened
to
prevent
thee
from
pursuing
my
directions
and
staying
for
me
at
the
gate
where
have
i
missed
thee
thou
joy
of
my
soul
by
what
dire
mistake
have
i
lost
thee
and
where
oh
where
art
thou
my
charming
lover
i
sought
thee
every
where
but
like
the
languishing
abandoned
mistress
in
the
i
sought
thee
but
i
found
thee
not
no
bed
of
roses
would
discover
thee
i
saw
no
print
of
thy
dear
shape
nor
heard
no
amorous
sigh
that
could
direct
me
i
asked
the
wood
and
springs
complained
and
called
on
thee
through
all
the
groves
but
they
confessed
thee
not
nothing
but
echoes
answered
me
and
when
i
cried
cried
thus
searched
i
till
the
coming
night
and
my
increasing
fears
made
me
resolve
for
flight
which
soon
we
did
and
soon
arrived
at
but
whither
then
to
go
heaven
knows
i
could
not
tell
for
i
was
almost
naked
friendless
and
forlorn
at
last
consulting
what
to
do
after
a
thousand
revolutions
he
concluded
to
trust
me
with
a
sister
he
had
who
was
married
to
a
of
the
de
he
changed
my
name
and
made
me
pass
for
a
fortune
he
had
stolen
but
oh
no
welcomes
nor
my
safe
retreat
were
sufficient
to
repose
me
all
the
ensuing
night
for
i
had
no
news
of
no
not
a
dream
informed
me
a
thousand
fears
and
jealousies
have
kept
me
waking
and
who
has
been
all
night
in
pursuit
of
thee
is
now
returned
successless
and
distracted
as
thy
for
duty
and
generosity
have
almost
the
same
effects
in
him
with
love
and
tenderness
and
jealousy
in
me
and
since
affords
no
news
of
thee
which
sure
it
would
if
thou
wert
in
it
for
oh
the
sun
might
hide
himself
with
as
much
ease
as
great
he
is
resolved
to
search
st
wood
and
all
the
adjacent
cottages
and
groves
he
thinks
that
you
not
knowing
of
my
escape
may
yet
be
waiting
thereabouts
since
quitting
the
chariot
for
fear
of
being
seen
you
might
be
so
far
advanced
into
the
wood
as
not
to
find
the
way
back
to
the
thicket
where
the
chariot
waited
it
is
thus
he
feeds
my
hope
and
flatters
my
poor
heart
that
fain
would
think
thee
true
or
if
thou
be
st
not
but
cursed
be
all
such
thoughts
and
far
from
soul
no
no
thou
art
not
false
it
can
not
be
thou
art
a
god
and
art
unchangeable
i
know
by
some
mistake
thou
art
attending
me
as
wild
and
impatient
as
i
perhaps
you
thinkest
me
false
and
thinkest
i
have
not
courage
to
pursue
my
love
and
fly
and
thou
perhaps
art
waiting
for
the
hour
wherein
thou
thinkest
i
will
give
myself
away
to
oh
cruel
and
unkind
to
think
i
loved
so
lightly
to
think
i
would
attend
that
fatal
hour
no
no
faithless
dear
enchanter
last
night
the
eve
to
my
intended
having
reposed
my
soul
by
my
resolves
for
flight
and
only
waiting
the
lucky
minute
for
escape
i
set
a
willing
hand
to
every
thing
that
was
preparing
for
the
ceremony
of
the
ensuing
morning
with
that
pretence
i
got
me
early
to
my
chamber
tried
on
a
thousand
dresses
and
asked
a
thousand
questions
all
impertinent
which
would
do
best
which
looked
most
gay
and
rich
then
dressed
my
gown
with
jewels
decked
my
apartment
up
and
left
nothing
undone
that
might
secure
em
both
of
my
being
pleased
and
of
my
stay
nay
and
to
give
the
less
suspicion
i
undressed
myself
even
to
my
and
i
would
not
take
a
jewel
not
a
pistole
but
left
my
women
finishing
my
work
and
carelessly
and
thus
undressed
walked
towards
the
garden
and
while
every
one
was
busy
in
their
office
getting
myself
out
of
sight
posted
over
the
meadow
to
the
wood
as
swift
as
from
the
god
of
day
till
i
arrived
most
luckily
where
i
found
the
chariot
waiting
attended
by
of
whom
when
i
all
fainting
and
breathless
with
my
swift
flight
demanded
his
lord
he
lifted
me
into
the
chariot
and
cried
a
little
farther
you
will
find
him
for
he
for
fear
of
making
a
discovery
took
yonder
shaded
path
towards
which
we
went
but
no
dear
vision
of
my
love
appeared
and
thus
my
charming
lover
you
have
my
kind
adventure
send
me
some
tidings
back
that
you
are
found
that
you
are
well
and
lastly
that
you
are
mine
or
this
that
should
have
been
my
will
see
itself
that
of
the
death
of
sylvia
paris
from
my
bed
for
want
of
clothes
or
rather
news
philander
sylvia
my
life
my
my
eternal
joy
art
thou
then
safe
and
art
thou
reserved
for
am
i
so
blest
by
heaven
by
love
and
my
dear
charming
maid
then
let
me
die
in
peace
since
i
have
lived
to
see
all
that
my
soul
desires
in
being
mine
perplex
not
thy
soft
heart
with
fears
or
jealousies
nor
think
so
basely
so
poorly
of
my
love
to
need
more
oaths
or
vows
yet
to
confirm
thee
i
would
swear
my
breath
away
but
oh
it
needs
not
here
take
then
no
care
my
lovely
dear
turn
not
thy
charming
eyes
or
thoughts
on
afflicting
objects
oh
think
not
on
what
thou
hast
abandoned
but
what
thou
art
arrived
to
look
forward
on
the
joys
of
love
and
youth
for
i
will
dedicate
all
my
remaining
life
to
render
thine
serene
and
glad
and
yet
my
thou
art
so
dear
to
me
so
wondrous
precious
to
my
soul
that
in
my
extravagance
of
love
i
fear
i
shall
grow
a
troublesome
and
wearying
coxcomb
shall
dread
every
look
thou
givest
away
from
me
a
smile
will
make
me
rave
a
sigh
or
touch
make
me
commit
a
murder
on
the
happy
slave
or
my
own
jealous
heart
but
all
the
world
besides
is
all
but
another
lover
but
i
rave
and
run
too
fast
away
ages
must
pass
a
tedious
term
of
years
before
i
can
be
jealous
or
conceive
thou
can
st
be
weary
of
i
will
be
so
fond
so
doting
and
so
playing
thou
shalt
not
have
an
idle
minute
to
throw
away
a
look
in
or
a
thought
on
any
other
no
no
i
have
thee
now
and
will
maintain
my
right
by
dint
and
force
of
love
oh
i
am
wild
to
see
thee
but
i
am
wounded
do
not
be
frighted
though
for
it
is
not
much
or
dangerous
but
very
troublesome
since
it
permits
me
not
to
fly
to
but
she
must
come
to
me
in
order
to
it
has
a
bill
on
my
goldsmith
in
for
a
thousand
pistoles
to
buy
thee
something
to
put
on
any
thing
that
is
ready
and
he
will
conduct
thee
to
me
for
i
shall
rave
myself
into
a
fever
if
i
see
thee
not
i
can
not
live
without
thee
now
for
thou
art
my
life
my
everlasting
charmer
i
have
ordered
to
get
a
chariot
and
some
unknown
livery
for
thee
and
i
think
the
continuance
of
passing
for
what
he
has
already
rendered
thee
will
do
very
well
till
i
have
taken
farther
care
of
thy
dear
safety
which
will
be
as
soon
as
i
am
able
to
rise
for
most
unfortunately
my
dear
quitting
the
chariot
in
the
thicket
for
fear
of
being
seen
with
it
and
walking
down
a
shaded
path
that
suited
with
the
melancholy
and
fears
of
unsuccess
in
thy
adventure
i
went
so
far
as
ere
i
could
return
to
the
place
where
i
left
the
chariot
it
was
gone
it
seems
with
thee
i
know
not
how
you
missed
me
but
possessed
myself
with
a
thousand
false
fears
sometimes
that
in
thy
flight
thou
mightest
be
pursued
and
overtaken
seized
in
the
chariot
and
returned
back
to
or
that
the
chariot
was
found
seized
on
upon
suspicion
though
the
coachman
and
were
disguised
past
knowledge
or
if
thou
wert
gone
alas
i
knew
not
whither
but
that
was
a
thought
my
doubts
and
fears
would
not
suffer
me
to
ease
my
soul
with
no
i
as
jealous
lovers
do
imagined
the
most
tormenting
things
for
my
own
repose
i
imagined
the
chariot
taken
or
at
least
so
discovered
as
to
be
forced
away
without
thee
i
imagined
that
thou
wert
false
heaven
forgive
me
false
my
and
hadst
changed
thy
mind
mad
with
this
thought
which
i
fancied
most
reasonable
and
fixt
it
in
my
soul
i
raved
about
the
wood
making
a
thousand
vows
to
be
revenged
on
all
in
order
to
it
i
left
the
thicket
and
betook
myself
to
the
high
road
of
the
wood
where
i
laid
me
down
among
the
fern
close
hid
with
sword
ready
waiting
for
the
happy
bridegroom
who
i
knew
it
being
the
wedding
eve
would
that
way
pass
that
evening
pleased
with
revenge
which
now
had
got
even
the
place
of
love
i
waited
there
not
above
a
little
hour
but
heard
the
trampling
of
a
horse
and
looking
up
with
mighty
joy
i
found
it
alone
he
was
and
unattended
for
he
d
outstripped
his
equipage
and
with
a
lover
s
haste
and
full
of
joy
was
making
towards
but
i
now
fired
with
rage
leaped
from
my
cover
cried
stay
ere
you
arrive
to
we
must
adjust
an
odd
account
between
us
at
which
he
stopping
as
nimbly
alighted
in
fine
we
fought
and
many
wounds
were
given
and
received
on
both
sides
till
his
people
coming
up
parted
us
just
as
we
were
fainting
with
loss
of
blood
in
each
other
s
arms
his
coach
and
chariot
were
amongst
his
equipage
into
the
first
his
servants
lifted
him
when
he
cried
out
with
a
feeble
voice
to
have
me
who
now
lay
bleeding
on
the
ground
put
into
the
chariot
and
to
be
safely
conveyed
i
commanded
and
so
in
haste
they
drove
him
towards
and
me
who
was
resolved
not
to
stir
far
from
it
to
a
village
within
a
mile
of
it
from
whence
i
sent
to
for
a
surgeon
and
dismissed
the
chariot
ordering
in
the
hearing
of
the
coachman
a
litter
to
be
brought
me
immediately
to
convey
me
that
night
to
but
the
surgeon
coming
found
it
not
safe
for
me
to
be
removed
and
i
am
now
willing
to
live
since
is
mine
haste
to
me
then
my
lovely
maid
and
fear
not
being
discovered
for
i
have
given
order
here
in
the
where
i
am
if
any
inquiry
is
made
after
me
to
say
i
went
last
night
to
haste
my
love
haste
to
my
arms
as
feeble
as
they
are
they
ll
grasp
thee
a
dear
welcome
i
will
say
no
more
nor
prescribe
rules
to
thy
love
that
can
inform
thee
best
what
thou
must
do
to
save
the
life
of
thy
most
passionate
adorer
philander
philander
i
have
sent
to
see
if
the
coast
be
clear
that
we
may
come
with
safety
he
brings
you
instead
of
a
young
cavalier
that
will
be
altogether
as
welcome
to
and
who
impatiently
waits
his
return
at
a
little
cottage
at
the
end
of
the
village
sylvia
bastille
i
know
my
expected
me
at
home
with
her
at
dinner
and
wonders
how
i
could
live
so
long
as
since
morning
without
the
eternal
joy
of
my
soul
but
know
my
that
a
trivial
misfortune
is
now
fallen
upon
me
which
in
the
midst
of
all
our
heaven
of
joys
our
softest
hours
of
life
has
so
often
changed
thy
smiles
into
fears
and
sighings
and
ruffled
thy
calm
soul
with
cares
nor
let
it
now
seem
strange
or
afflicting
since
every
day
for
these
three
months
we
have
been
alarmed
with
new
fears
that
have
made
thee
uneasy
even
in
arms
we
knew
some
time
or
other
the
storm
would
fall
on
us
though
we
had
for
three
happy
months
sheltered
ourselves
from
its
threatening
rage
but
love
i
hope
has
armed
us
both
for
me
let
me
be
deprived
of
all
joys
but
those
my
charmer
can
dispense
all
the
false
world
s
respect
the
dull
esteem
of
fools
and
formal
coxcombs
the
grave
advice
of
the
censorious
wise
the
kind
opinion
of
women
no
matter
so
my
remain
but
mine
i
am
my
arrested
at
the
suit
of
the
count
your
father
for
a
rape
on
my
lovely
maid
i
desire
my
soul
you
will
immediately
take
coach
and
go
to
the
prince
and
he
will
bail
me
out
i
fear
not
a
fair
trial
and
thefts
of
mutual
love
were
never
counted
felony
i
may
die
for
love
my
but
not
for
loving
go
haste
my
that
i
may
be
no
longer
detained
from
the
solid
pleasure
and
business
of
my
soul
haste
my
loved
dear
haste
and
relieve
philander
not
to
me
lest
there
should
be
an
order
to
detain
my
philander
i
am
not
at
all
surprised
my
at
the
accident
that
has
befallen
thee
because
so
long
expected
and
love
has
so
well
fortified
my
heart
that
i
support
our
misfortunes
with
a
courage
worthy
of
her
that
loves
and
is
beloved
by
the
glorious
i
am
armed
for
the
worst
that
can
befall
me
and
that
is
my
being
rendered
a
public
shame
who
have
been
so
in
the
private
whispers
of
all
the
court
for
near
these
happy
three
months
in
which
i
have
had
the
wondrous
satisfaction
of
being
retired
from
the
world
with
the
charming
my
father
too
knew
it
long
since
at
least
he
could
not
hinder
himself
from
guessing
it
though
his
fond
indulgence
suffered
his
justice
and
his
anger
to
sleep
and
possibly
had
still
slept
had
not
spite
and
rage
i
should
say
just
resentment
but
i
can
not
roused
up
his
drowsy
vengeance
i
know
she
has
plied
him
with
her
softening
eloquence
her
prayers
and
tears
to
win
him
to
consent
to
make
a
public
business
of
it
but
i
am
entered
love
has
armed
my
soul
and
i
ll
pursue
my
fortune
with
that
height
of
fortitude
as
shall
surprise
the
world
yes
since
i
have
lost
my
honour
fame
and
friends
my
interest
and
my
parents
and
all
for
mightier
love
i
ll
stop
at
nothing
now
if
there
be
any
hazards
more
to
run
i
will
thank
the
spiteful
fates
that
bring
them
on
and
will
even
tire
them
out
with
my
unwearied
passion
love
on
if
thou
darest
like
me
let
em
pursue
me
with
their
hate
and
vengeance
let
prisons
poverty
and
tortures
seize
me
it
shall
not
take
one
grain
of
love
away
from
my
resolved
heart
nor
make
me
shed
a
tear
of
penitence
for
loving
thee
no
since
i
know
what
a
ravishing
pleasure
it
is
to
live
thine
i
will
never
quit
the
glory
of
dying
also
thy
sylvia
cesario
dear
is
coming
to
be
your
bail
monsieur
count
of
i
die
to
see
you
after
your
suffering
sylvia
sylvia
believe
me
charming
i
live
not
those
hours
i
am
absent
from
thee
thou
art
my
life
my
soul
and
my
eternal
felicity
while
you
believe
this
truth
my
you
will
not
entertain
a
thousand
fears
if
i
but
stay
a
moment
beyond
my
appointed
hour
especially
when
who
is
not
able
to
support
the
thought
that
any
thing
should
afflict
his
lovely
baby
takes
care
from
hour
to
hour
to
satisfy
her
tender
doubting
heart
my
dearest
i
am
gone
into
the
city
to
my
advocate
s
my
trial
with
the
count
your
father
coming
on
and
it
will
be
at
least
two
tedious
hours
ere
i
can
bring
my
adorable
her
philander
sylvia
i
was
called
on
my
dearest
child
at
my
advocate
s
by
there
is
some
great
business
this
evening
debated
in
the
cabal
which
is
at
in
the
city
tells
me
there
is
a
very
diligent
search
made
by
the
count
your
father
for
my
i
die
if
you
are
taken
lest
the
fright
should
hurt
thee
if
possible
i
would
have
thee
remove
this
evening
from
those
lodgings
lest
the
people
who
are
of
the
royal
party
should
be
induced
through
malice
or
gain
to
discover
thee
i
dare
not
come
myself
to
wait
on
thee
lest
my
being
seen
should
betray
thee
but
i
have
sent
whose
zeal
for
thee
shall
be
rewarded
to
conduct
thee
to
a
little
house
in
the
st
where
lives
a
pretty
woman
and
mistress
to
called
a
woman
of
wit
and
discreet
enough
to
understand
what
ought
to
be
paid
to
a
maid
of
the
quality
and
character
of
she
already
knows
the
stories
of
our
loves
thither
i
ll
come
to
thee
and
bring
to
supper
as
soon
as
the
cabal
breaks
up
oh
my
i
shall
one
day
recompense
all
thy
goodness
all
thy
bravery
thy
love
and
thy
suffering
for
thy
eternal
lover
and
slave
philander
philander
so
hasty
i
was
to
obey
commands
that
by
the
unwearied
care
and
industry
of
the
faithful
i
went
before
three
o
clock
disguised
away
to
the
place
whither
you
ordered
us
and
was
well
received
by
the
very
pretty
young
woman
of
the
house
who
has
sense
and
breeding
as
well
as
beauty
but
oh
this
flight
pleases
me
not
alas
what
have
i
done
my
fault
is
only
love
and
that
sure
i
should
boast
as
the
most
divine
passion
of
the
soul
no
no
it
is
not
my
love
s
the
criminal
no
not
the
placing
it
on
the
crime
but
it
is
thy
most
unhappy
circumstances
thy
being
married
and
that
was
no
crime
to
heaven
till
man
made
laws
and
can
laws
reach
to
damnation
if
so
curse
on
the
fatal
hour
that
thou
wert
married
curse
on
the
priest
that
joined
ye
and
curst
be
all
that
did
contribute
to
the
undoing
ceremony
except
tongue
that
answered
yes
oh
heavens
was
there
but
one
dear
man
of
all
your
whole
creation
that
could
charm
the
soul
of
and
could
ye
oh
ye
wise
powers
that
knew
my
soul
could
ye
give
him
away
how
had
my
innocence
offended
ye
our
hearts
you
did
create
for
mutual
love
how
came
the
dire
mistake
another
would
have
pleased
the
indifferent
soul
as
well
but
mine
was
fitted
for
no
other
man
only
the
adored
with
that
dear
form
that
shape
that
charming
face
that
hair
those
lovely
speaking
eyes
that
wounding
softness
in
his
tender
voice
had
power
to
conquer
and
can
this
be
a
sin
oh
heavens
can
it
must
laws
which
man
contrived
for
mere
conveniency
have
power
to
alter
the
divine
decrees
at
our
creation
perhaps
they
argue
at
the
bar
that
was
ordained
by
heaven
for
no
no
he
mistook
the
sister
it
was
pretty
near
he
came
but
by
a
fatal
error
was
mistaken
his
hasty
youth
made
him
too
negligently
stop
before
his
time
at
the
wrong
woman
he
should
have
gazed
a
little
farther
on
and
then
it
had
been
lot
it
is
fine
divinity
they
teach
that
cry
marriages
are
made
in
heaven
folly
and
madness
grown
into
grave
custom
should
an
unheedy
youth
in
heat
of
blood
take
up
with
the
first
convenient
she
that
offers
though
he
be
an
heir
to
some
grave
politician
great
and
rich
and
she
the
outcast
of
the
common
stews
coupled
in
height
of
wine
and
sudden
lust
which
once
allayed
and
that
the
sober
morning
wakes
him
to
see
his
error
he
quits
with
shame
the
jilt
and
owns
no
more
the
folly
shall
this
be
called
a
heavenly
conjunction
were
i
in
height
of
youth
as
now
i
am
forced
by
my
parents
obliged
by
interest
and
honour
to
marry
the
old
deformed
diseased
decrepit
count
whose
person
qualities
and
principles
i
loathe
and
rather
than
suffer
him
to
consummate
his
nuptials
suppose
i
should
as
sure
i
should
kill
myself
it
were
blasphemy
to
lay
this
fatal
marriage
to
heaven
s
charge
curse
on
your
nonsense
ye
imposing
gownmen
curse
on
your
holy
cant
you
may
as
well
call
rapes
and
murders
treason
and
robbery
the
acts
of
heaven
because
heaven
suffers
them
to
be
committed
is
it
heaven
s
pleasure
therefore
heaven
s
decree
a
trick
a
wise
device
of
priests
no
more
to
make
the
nauseated
pair
drag
on
the
careful
business
of
life
drudge
for
the
family
with
greater
satisfaction
because
they
are
taught
to
think
marriage
was
made
in
heaven
a
mighty
comfort
that
when
all
the
joys
of
life
are
lost
by
it
were
it
not
nobler
far
that
honour
kept
him
just
and
that
good
nature
made
him
reasonable
provision
daily
experience
proves
to
us
no
couple
live
with
less
content
less
ease
than
those
who
cry
heaven
joins
who
is
it
loves
less
than
those
that
marry
and
where
love
is
not
there
is
hate
and
loathing
at
best
disgust
disquiet
noise
and
repentance
no
that
s
a
heavenly
match
when
two
souls
touched
with
equal
passion
meet
which
is
but
rarely
seen
when
willing
vows
with
serious
considerations
are
weighed
and
made
when
a
true
view
is
taken
of
the
soul
when
no
base
interest
makes
the
hasty
bargain
when
no
conveniency
or
design
or
drudge
or
slave
shall
find
it
necessary
when
equal
judgements
meet
that
can
esteem
the
blessings
they
possess
and
distinguish
the
good
of
either
s
love
and
set
a
value
on
each
other
s
merits
and
where
both
understand
to
take
and
pay
who
find
the
beauty
of
each
other
s
minds
and
rate
them
as
they
ought
whom
not
a
formal
ceremony
binds
with
which
i
ve
nought
to
do
but
dully
give
a
cold
consenting
affirmative
but
well
considered
vows
from
soft
inclining
hearts
uttered
with
love
with
joy
with
dear
delight
when
heaven
is
called
to
witness
she
is
thy
wife
he
is
my
husband
this
is
the
match
this
heaven
designs
and
means
how
then
oh
how
came
i
to
miss
or
he
his
sylvia
i
writ
this
which
i
designed
not
an
invective
against
marriage
when
i
began
but
to
inform
thee
of
my
being
where
you
directed
but
since
i
write
this
i
say
the
house
where
i
am
is
broken
open
with
warrants
and
officers
for
me
but
being
all
undressed
and
ill
the
officer
has
taken
my
word
for
my
appearance
it
seems
they
saw
me
when
i
went
from
my
lodgings
and
pursued
me
haste
to
me
for
i
shall
need
your
sylvia
my
eternal
joy
my
affliction
is
inexpressible
at
the
news
you
send
me
of
your
being
surprised
i
am
not
able
to
wait
on
thee
yet
not
being
suffered
to
leave
the
cabal
i
only
borrow
this
minute
to
tell
thee
the
sense
of
my
advocate
in
this
case
which
was
if
thou
should
be
taken
there
was
no
way
no
law
to
save
thee
from
being
ravished
from
my
arms
but
that
of
marrying
thee
to
some
body
whom
i
can
trust
this
we
have
often
discoursed
and
thou
hast
often
vowed
thou
lt
do
any
thing
rather
than
kill
me
with
a
separation
resolve
then
oh
thou
charmer
of
my
soul
to
do
a
deed
that
though
the
name
would
fright
thee
only
can
preserve
both
thee
and
me
it
is
and
though
it
have
no
other
terror
in
it
than
the
name
i
faint
to
speak
it
to
marry
yes
thou
must
marry
though
thou
art
mine
as
fast
as
heaven
can
make
us
yet
thou
must
marry
i
have
pitched
upon
the
property
it
is
him
i
can
only
trust
in
this
affair
it
is
but
joining
hands
no
more
my
is
a
gentleman
though
a
and
may
be
supposed
to
pretend
to
so
great
a
happiness
and
whose
only
crime
is
want
of
fortune
he
is
handsome
too
well
made
well
bred
and
so
much
real
esteem
he
has
for
me
and
i
have
so
obliged
him
that
i
am
confident
he
will
pretend
no
farther
than
to
the
honour
of
owning
thee
in
court
i
ll
time
him
from
it
nay
he
dares
not
do
it
i
will
trust
him
with
my
life
but
oh
is
more
think
of
it
and
this
night
we
will
perform
it
there
being
no
other
way
to
keep
eternally
philander
s
sylvia
now
my
adorable
you
have
truly
need
of
all
that
heroic
bravery
of
mind
i
ever
thought
thee
mistress
of
for
coming
from
thee
this
morning
and
riding
full
speed
for
i
was
met
stopped
and
seized
for
by
the
king
s
messengers
and
possibly
may
fall
a
sacrifice
to
the
anger
of
an
incensed
monarch
my
bear
this
last
shock
of
fate
with
a
courage
worthy
thy
great
and
glorious
soul
tis
but
a
little
separation
and
we
shall
one
day
meet
again
by
heaven
i
find
no
other
sting
in
death
but
parting
with
my
and
every
parting
would
have
been
the
same
i
might
have
died
by
thy
disdain
thou
might
st
have
grown
weary
of
thy
have
loved
another
and
have
broke
thy
vows
and
tortured
me
to
death
these
crueller
ways
but
fate
is
kinder
to
me
and
i
go
blest
with
my
love
for
which
heaven
may
do
much
for
her
dear
sake
to
recompense
her
faith
a
maid
so
innocent
and
true
to
sacred
love
expect
the
best
my
lovely
dear
the
worst
has
this
comfort
in
it
that
i
shall
die
my
charming
philander
philander
i
ll
only
say
thou
dear
supporter
of
my
soul
that
if
dies
he
shall
not
go
to
heaven
without
his
by
heaven
and
earth
i
swear
it
i
can
not
live
without
thee
nor
shall
thou
die
without
thy
sylvia
sylvia
see
see
my
adorable
angel
what
care
the
powers
above
take
of
divine
innocence
true
love
and
beauty
oh
see
what
they
have
done
for
their
darling
could
they
do
less
know
my
dear
maid
that
after
being
examined
before
the
king
i
was
found
guilty
enough
to
be
committed
to
the
from
whence
if
i
had
gone
i
had
never
returned
but
to
my
death
but
the
messenger
into
whose
hands
i
was
committed
refusing
other
guards
being
alone
with
me
in
my
own
coach
i
resolved
to
kill
if
i
could
no
other
way
oblige
him
to
favour
my
escape
i
tried
with
gold
before
i
shewed
my
dagger
and
that
prevailed
a
way
less
criminal
and
i
have
taken
sanctuary
in
a
small
cottage
near
the
where
i
wait
for
and
though
my
life
depend
upon
my
flight
nay
more
the
life
of
i
can
not
go
without
her
dress
yourself
then
my
dearest
in
your
boy
s
clothes
and
haste
with
whither
this
seaman
will
conduct
thee
whom
i
have
hired
to
set
us
on
some
shore
of
safety
bring
what
news
you
can
learn
of
i
would
not
have
him
die
poorly
after
all
his
mighty
hopes
nor
be
conducted
to
a
scaffold
with
shouts
of
joys
by
that
uncertain
beast
the
rabble
who
used
to
stop
his
with
fickle
adorations
whenever
he
looked
abroad
by
heaven
i
pity
him
but
presence
will
chase
away
all
thoughts
but
those
of
love
from
philander
need
not
bid
thee
end
of
the
first
between
a
nobleman
and
his
sister
part
ii
at
the
end
of
the
first
part
of
these
letters
we
left
impatiently
waiting
on
the
for
the
approach
of
the
lovely
who
accordingly
came
to
him
dressed
like
a
youth
to
secure
herself
from
a
discovery
they
stayed
not
long
to
caress
each
other
but
he
taking
the
welcome
maid
in
his
arms
with
a
transported
joy
bore
her
to
a
small
vessel
that
lay
ready
near
the
beach
where
with
only
and
two
men
servants
they
put
to
sea
and
passed
into
landing
at
the
nearest
port
where
after
having
refreshed
themselves
for
two
or
three
days
they
passed
forwards
towards
the
still
remaining
under
that
amiable
disguise
but
in
their
passage
from
town
to
town
which
is
sometimes
by
coach
and
other
times
by
boat
they
chanced
one
day
to
encounter
a
young
of
a
more
than
ordinary
gallantry
for
that
country
so
degenerate
from
good
manners
and
almost
common
civility
and
so
far
short
of
all
the
good
qualities
that
made
themselves
appear
in
this
young
nobleman
he
was
very
handsome
well
made
well
dressed
and
very
well
attended
and
whom
we
will
call
and
who
young
as
he
was
was
one
of
the
of
he
spoke
admirable
good
and
had
a
vivacity
and
quickness
of
wit
unusual
with
the
natives
of
that
part
of
the
world
and
almost
above
all
the
rest
of
his
sex
and
having
already
agreed
for
the
cabin
of
the
vessel
that
was
to
carry
them
to
the
next
stage
came
too
late
to
have
any
place
there
but
amongst
the
common
crowd
which
the
master
of
the
vessel
who
knew
him
was
much
troubled
at
and
addressed
himself
as
civilly
as
he
could
to
to
beg
permission
for
one
stranger
of
quality
to
dispose
of
himself
in
the
cabin
for
that
day
being
well
enough
pleased
so
to
make
an
acquaintance
with
some
of
power
of
that
country
readily
consented
and
entered
with
an
address
so
graceful
and
obliging
that
at
first
sight
he
inclined
heart
to
a
friendship
with
him
and
on
the
other
side
the
lovely
person
of
the
quality
that
appeared
in
his
face
and
mien
obliged
to
become
no
less
his
admirer
but
when
he
saluted
who
appeared
to
him
a
youth
of
quality
he
was
extremely
charmed
with
her
pretty
gaiety
and
an
unusual
air
and
life
in
her
address
and
motion
he
felt
a
secret
joy
and
pleasure
play
about
his
soul
he
knew
not
why
and
was
almost
angry
that
he
felt
such
an
emotion
for
a
youth
though
the
most
lovely
that
he
ever
saw
after
the
first
compliments
they
fell
into
discourse
of
a
thousand
indifferent
things
and
if
he
were
pleased
at
first
sight
with
the
two
lovers
he
was
wholly
charmed
by
their
conversation
especially
that
of
the
amiable
youth
who
well
enough
pleased
with
the
young
stranger
or
else
hitherto
having
met
nothing
so
accomplished
in
her
short
travels
and
indeed
despairing
to
meet
any
such
she
put
on
all
her
gaiety
and
charms
of
wit
and
made
as
absolute
a
conquest
as
it
was
possible
for
her
supposed
sex
to
do
over
a
man
who
was
a
great
admirer
of
the
other
and
surely
the
lovely
maid
never
appeared
so
charming
and
desirable
as
that
day
they
dined
together
in
the
cabin
and
after
dinner
reposed
on
little
mattresses
by
each
other
s
side
where
every
motion
every
limb
as
carelessly
she
lay
discovered
a
thousand
graces
and
more
and
more
enflamed
the
now
beginning
lover
she
could
not
move
nor
smile
nor
speak
nor
order
any
charm
about
her
but
had
some
peculiar
grace
that
began
to
make
him
uneasy
and
from
a
thousand
little
modesties
both
in
her
blushes
and
motions
he
had
a
secret
hope
she
was
not
what
she
seemed
but
of
that
sex
whereof
she
discovered
so
many
softnesses
and
beauties
though
to
what
advantage
that
hope
would
amount
to
his
repose
was
yet
a
disquiet
he
had
not
considered
nor
felt
nor
could
he
by
any
fondness
between
them
or
indiscretion
of
love
conceive
how
the
lovely
strangers
were
allied
he
only
hoped
and
had
no
thoughts
of
fear
or
any
thing
that
could
check
his
new
beginning
flame
while
thus
they
passed
the
afternoon
they
asked
a
thousand
questions
of
lovers
of
the
country
and
manners
and
their
security
and
civility
to
strangers
to
all
which
answered
as
a
man
who
would
recommend
the
place
and
persons
purely
to
oblige
their
stay
for
now
makes
him
say
all
things
in
favour
of
it
and
of
his
own
friendship
offers
them
all
the
service
of
a
man
in
power
and
who
could
make
an
interest
in
those
that
had
more
than
himself
much
he
protested
much
he
offered
and
yet
no
more
than
he
designed
to
make
good
on
all
occasions
which
they
received
with
an
acknowledgement
that
plainly
discovered
a
generosity
and
quality
above
the
common
rate
of
men
so
that
finding
in
each
other
occasions
for
love
and
friendship
they
mutually
professed
it
and
nobly
entertained
it
told
his
name
and
quality
left
nothing
unsaid
that
might
confirm
the
lovers
of
his
sincerity
this
begot
a
confidence
in
who
in
return
told
him
so
much
of
his
circumstances
as
sufficed
to
let
him
know
he
was
a
person
so
unfortunate
to
have
occasioned
the
displeasure
of
his
king
against
him
and
that
he
could
not
continue
with
any
repose
in
that
kingdom
whose
monarch
thought
him
no
longer
fit
for
those
honours
he
had
before
received
renewed
his
protestations
of
serving
him
with
his
interest
and
fortune
which
the
other
receiving
with
all
the
gallant
modesty
of
an
unfortunate
man
they
came
ashore
where
coaches
and
equipage
waiting
his
coming
to
conduct
him
to
his
house
he
offered
his
new
friends
the
best
of
them
to
carry
them
to
their
lodging
which
he
had
often
pressed
might
be
his
own
palace
but
that
being
refused
as
too
great
an
honour
he
would
himself
see
them
placed
in
some
one
which
he
thought
might
be
most
suitable
to
their
quality
they
excused
the
trouble
but
he
pressed
too
eagerly
to
be
denied
and
he
conducted
them
to
a
merchant
s
house
not
far
from
his
own
so
love
had
contrived
for
the
better
management
of
this
new
affair
of
his
heart
which
he
resolved
to
pursue
be
the
fair
object
of
what
sex
soever
but
after
having
well
enough
recommended
them
to
the
care
of
the
merchant
he
thought
it
justice
to
leave
them
to
their
rest
though
with
abundance
of
reluctancy
so
took
his
leave
of
both
the
lovely
strangers
and
went
to
his
own
home
and
after
a
hasty
supper
got
himself
up
to
bed
not
to
sleep
for
now
he
had
other
business
love
took
him
now
to
task
and
asked
his
heart
a
thousand
questions
then
it
was
he
found
the
idea
of
that
fair
unknown
had
absolute
possession
there
nor
was
he
at
all
displeased
to
find
he
was
a
captive
his
youth
and
quality
promise
his
hopes
a
thousand
advantages
above
all
other
men
but
when
he
reflected
on
the
beauty
of
philander
on
his
charming
youth
and
conversation
and
every
grace
that
adorns
a
conqueror
he
grew
inflamed
disordered
restless
angry
and
out
of
love
with
his
own
attractions
considered
every
beauty
of
his
own
person
and
found
them
or
at
least
thought
them
infinitely
short
of
those
of
his
now
fancied
rival
yet
it
was
a
rival
that
he
could
not
hate
nor
did
his
passion
abate
one
thought
of
his
friendship
for
philander
but
rather
more
increased
it
insomuch
that
he
once
resolved
it
should
surmount
his
love
if
possible
at
least
he
left
it
on
the
till
time
should
make
a
better
discovery
when
tired
with
thought
we
ll
suppose
him
asleep
and
see
how
our
lovers
fared
who
being
lodged
all
on
one
that
is
philander
sylvia
and
brilliard
it
was
not
hard
for
the
lover
to
steal
into
the
longing
arms
of
the
expecting
no
fatigues
of
tedious
journeys
and
little
voyages
had
abated
her
fondness
or
his
vigour
the
night
was
like
the
first
all
joy
all
transport
lay
so
near
as
to
be
a
witness
to
all
their
sighs
of
love
and
little
soft
murmurs
who
now
began
from
a
servant
to
be
permitted
as
an
humble
companion
since
he
had
had
the
honour
of
being
married
to
though
yet
he
durst
not
lift
his
eyes
or
thoughts
that
way
yet
it
might
be
perceived
he
was
melancholy
and
sullen
whenever
he
saw
their
dalliances
nor
could
he
know
the
joys
his
lord
nightly
stole
without
an
impatience
which
if
but
minded
or
known
perhaps
had
cost
him
his
life
he
began
from
the
thoughts
she
was
his
wife
to
fancy
fine
enjoyment
to
fancy
authority
which
he
durst
not
assume
and
often
wished
his
lord
would
grow
cold
as
possessing
lovers
do
that
then
he
might
advance
his
hope
when
he
should
even
abandon
or
slight
her
he
could
not
see
her
kissed
without
blushing
with
resentment
but
if
he
has
assisted
to
undress
him
for
her
bed
he
was
ready
to
die
with
anger
and
would
grow
sick
and
leave
the
office
to
himself
he
could
not
see
her
naked
charms
her
arms
stretched
out
to
receive
a
lover
with
impatient
joy
without
madness
to
see
her
clasp
him
fast
when
he
threw
himself
into
her
soft
white
bosom
and
smother
him
with
kisses
no
he
could
not
bear
it
now
and
almost
lost
his
respect
when
he
beheld
it
and
grew
saucy
unperceived
and
it
was
in
vain
that
he
looked
back
upon
the
reward
he
had
to
stand
for
that
necessary
cypher
a
husband
in
vain
he
considered
the
reasons
why
and
the
occasion
wherefore
he
now
seeks
precedents
of
usurped
dominion
and
thinks
she
is
his
wife
and
has
forgot
that
he
is
her
creature
and
vassal
these
thoughts
disturbed
him
all
the
night
and
a
certain
jealousy
or
rather
curiosity
to
listen
to
every
motion
of
the
lovers
while
they
were
employed
after
a
different
manner
next
day
it
was
debated
what
was
best
to
be
done
as
to
their
conduct
in
that
place
or
whether
should
yet
own
her
sex
or
not
but
she
pleased
with
the
cavalier
in
herself
begged
she
might
live
under
that
disguise
which
indeed
gave
her
a
thousand
charms
to
those
which
nature
had
already
bestowed
on
her
sex
and
philander
was
well
enough
pleased
she
should
continue
in
that
agreeable
dress
which
did
not
only
add
to
her
beauty
but
gave
her
a
thousand
little
privileges
which
otherwise
would
have
been
denied
to
women
though
in
a
country
of
much
freedom
every
day
she
appeared
in
the
tour
she
failed
not
to
make
a
conquest
on
some
unguarded
heart
of
the
fair
sex
not
was
it
long
ere
she
received
from
many
of
the
most
accomplished
who
could
speak
and
write
this
gave
them
a
pleasure
in
the
midst
of
her
unlucky
exile
and
she
failed
not
to
boast
her
conquests
to
octavio
who
every
day
gave
all
his
hours
to
love
under
the
disguise
of
friendship
and
every
day
received
new
wounds
both
from
her
conversation
and
beauty
and
every
day
confirmed
him
more
in
his
first
belief
that
she
was
a
woman
and
that
confirmed
his
love
but
still
he
took
care
to
hide
his
passion
with
a
gallantry
that
was
natural
to
him
and
to
very
few
besides
and
he
managed
his
eyes
which
were
always
full
of
love
so
equally
to
both
that
when
he
was
soft
and
fond
it
appeared
more
his
natural
humour
than
from
any
particular
cause
and
that
you
may
believe
that
all
the
arts
of
gallantry
and
graces
of
good
management
were
more
peculiarly
his
than
another
s
his
race
was
illustrious
being
descended
from
that
of
the
princes
of
and
great
birth
will
shine
through
and
shew
itself
in
spite
of
education
and
obscurity
but
had
all
those
additions
that
render
a
man
truly
great
and
brave
and
this
is
the
character
of
him
that
was
next
undone
by
our
unfortunate
and
fatal
beauty
at
this
rate
for
some
time
they
lived
thus
disguised
under
feigned
names
omitting
nothing
that
might
oblige
them
in
the
highest
degree
and
hardly
any
thing
was
talked
of
but
the
new
and
beautiful
strangers
whose
conquests
in
all
places
over
the
ladies
are
well
worthy
both
for
their
rarity
and
comedy
to
be
related
entirely
by
themselves
in
a
novel
saw
every
day
with
abundance
of
pleasure
the
little
revenges
of
love
on
those
women
s
hearts
who
had
made
before
little
conquests
over
him
and
strove
by
all
the
gay
presents
he
made
a
young
for
so
they
called
to
make
him
appear
unresistible
to
the
ladies
and
while
gave
them
new
wounds
failed
not
to
receive
them
too
among
the
crowd
till
at
last
he
became
a
confirmed
slave
to
the
lovely
unknown
and
that
which
was
yet
more
strange
she
captivated
the
men
no
less
than
the
women
who
often
gave
her
under
her
window
with
songs
fitted
to
the
courtship
of
a
boy
all
which
added
to
their
diversion
but
fortune
had
smiled
long
enough
and
now
grew
weary
of
obliging
she
was
resolved
to
undeceive
both
sexes
and
let
them
see
the
errors
of
their
love
for
fell
into
a
fever
so
violent
that
no
longer
hoped
for
her
recovery
insomuch
that
she
was
obliged
to
own
her
sex
and
take
women
servants
out
of
decency
this
made
the
first
discovery
of
who
and
what
they
were
and
for
which
every
body
languished
under
a
secret
grief
but
who
now
was
not
only
confirmed
she
was
a
woman
but
that
she
was
neither
wife
to
nor
could
in
almost
all
possibility
ever
be
so
that
she
was
his
mistress
gave
him
hope
that
she
might
one
day
as
well
be
conquered
by
him
and
he
found
her
youth
her
beauty
and
her
quality
merited
all
his
pains
of
lavish
courtship
and
now
there
remains
no
more
than
the
fear
of
her
dying
to
oblige
him
immediately
to
a
discovery
of
his
passion
too
violent
now
by
his
new
hope
to
be
longer
concealed
but
decency
forbids
he
should
now
pursue
the
dear
design
he
waited
and
made
vows
for
her
recovery
visited
her
and
found
the
most
deplorable
object
that
despair
and
love
could
render
him
who
lay
eternally
weeping
on
her
bed
and
no
counsel
or
persuasion
could
remove
him
thence
but
if
by
chance
they
made
him
sensible
it
was
for
her
repose
he
would
depart
to
ease
his
mind
by
new
torments
he
would
rave
and
tear
his
delicate
hair
sigh
and
weep
upon
bosom
and
a
thousand
times
begin
to
unfold
the
story
already
known
to
the
generous
rival
despair
and
hopes
of
pity
from
him
made
him
utter
all
and
one
day
when
by
the
advice
of
the
physician
he
was
forced
to
quit
the
chamber
to
give
her
rest
he
carried
to
his
own
and
told
him
from
the
beginning
all
the
story
of
his
love
with
the
charming
and
with
it
all
the
story
of
his
fate
sighing
though
glad
of
the
opportunity
told
him
his
affairs
were
already
but
too
well
known
and
that
he
feared
his
safety
from
that
discovery
since
the
states
had
obliged
themselves
to
harbour
no
declared
enemy
to
the
king
at
this
news
our
young
unfortunate
shewed
a
resentment
that
was
so
moving
that
even
who
felt
a
secret
joy
at
the
thoughts
of
his
departure
could
no
longer
refrain
from
pity
and
tenderness
even
to
a
wish
that
he
were
less
unhappy
and
never
to
part
from
but
love
soon
grew
again
triumphant
in
his
heart
and
all
he
could
say
was
that
he
would
afford
him
the
aids
of
all
his
power
in
this
encounter
which
with
the
acknowledgements
of
a
lover
whose
life
depended
on
it
he
received
and
parted
with
him
who
went
to
learn
what
was
decreed
in
council
concerning
him
while
returned
to
the
most
dejected
lover
that
ever
fate
produced
when
he
had
not
sighed
away
above
an
hour
but
received
a
billet
by
page
from
his
lord
he
went
to
his
own
apartment
to
read
it
fearing
it
might
contain
something
too
sad
for
him
to
be
able
to
hold
his
temper
at
the
reading
of
and
which
would
infallibly
have
disturbed
the
repose
of
who
shared
in
every
cruel
thought
of
when
he
was
alone
he
opened
it
and
read
this
octavio
philander
i
had
rather
die
than
be
the
ungrateful
messenger
of
news
which
i
am
sensible
will
prove
too
fatal
to
you
and
which
will
be
best
expressed
in
fewest
words
it
is
decreed
that
you
must
retire
from
the
united
provinces
in
four
and
twenty
hours
if
you
will
save
a
life
that
is
dear
to
me
and
there
being
no
other
security
against
your
being
rendered
up
to
the
king
of
support
it
well
and
hope
all
things
from
the
assistance
of
your
octavio
the
council
having
finished
the
reading
of
this
remained
a
while
wholly
without
life
or
motion
when
coming
to
himself
he
sighed
and
cried
why
farewell
trifling
life
if
of
the
two
extremes
one
must
be
chosen
rather
than
i
ll
abandon
i
ll
stay
and
be
delivered
up
a
victim
to
incensed
it
is
but
a
life
at
best
i
never
valued
thee
and
now
i
scorn
to
preserve
thee
at
the
price
of
tears
then
taking
a
hasty
turn
or
two
about
his
chamber
he
pausing
cried
but
by
my
stay
i
ruin
both
and
myself
her
life
depends
on
mine
and
it
is
impossible
hers
can
be
preserved
when
mine
is
in
danger
by
retiring
i
shall
shortly
again
be
blessed
with
her
sight
in
a
more
safe
security
by
staying
i
resign
myself
poorly
to
be
made
a
public
scorn
to
and
the
cruel
murderer
of
now
it
was
after
an
hundred
turns
and
pauses
intermixed
with
sighs
and
ravings
that
he
resolved
for
both
their
safeties
to
retire
and
having
a
while
longer
debated
within
himself
how
and
where
and
a
little
time
ruminated
on
his
hard
pursuing
fate
grown
to
a
calm
of
grief
less
easy
to
be
borne
than
rage
he
hastes
to
whom
he
found
something
more
cheerful
than
before
but
dares
not
acquaint
her
with
the
commands
he
had
to
depart
but
silently
he
views
her
while
tears
of
love
and
grief
glide
unperceivably
from
his
fine
eyes
his
soul
grows
tenderer
at
every
look
and
pity
and
compassion
joining
to
his
love
and
his
despair
set
him
on
the
wreck
of
life
and
now
believing
it
less
pain
to
die
than
to
leave
resolves
to
disobey
and
dare
the
worst
that
shall
befall
him
he
had
some
glimmering
hope
as
lovers
have
that
some
kind
chance
will
prevent
his
going
or
being
delivered
up
he
trusts
much
to
the
friendship
of
whose
power
joined
with
that
of
his
uncle
who
was
one
of
the
also
and
whom
he
had
an
ascendant
over
as
his
nephew
and
his
heir
might
serve
him
he
therefore
ventures
to
move
him
to
compassion
by
this
following
letter
philander
octavio
i
know
my
lord
that
the
exercise
of
virtue
and
justice
is
so
innate
to
your
soul
and
fixed
to
the
very
principle
of
a
generous
commonwealth
s
man
that
where
those
are
in
competition
it
is
neither
birth
wealth
or
glorious
merit
that
can
render
the
unfortunate
condemned
by
you
worthy
of
your
pity
or
pardon
your
very
sons
and
fathers
fall
before
your
justice
and
it
is
crime
enough
to
offend
though
innocently
the
least
of
your
wholesome
laws
to
fall
under
the
extremity
of
their
rigour
i
am
not
ignorant
neither
how
flourishing
this
necessary
tyranny
this
lawful
oppression
renders
your
state
how
safe
and
glorious
how
secure
from
enemies
at
home
those
worst
of
foes
and
how
feared
by
those
abroad
pursue
then
sir
your
justifiable
method
and
still
be
high
and
mighty
retain
your
ancient
roman
virtue
and
still
be
great
as
herself
in
her
height
of
glorious
commonwealths
rule
your
stubborn
natives
by
her
excellent
examples
and
let
the
height
of
your
ambition
be
only
to
be
as
severely
just
as
rigidly
good
as
you
please
but
like
her
too
be
pitiful
to
strangers
and
dispense
a
noble
charity
to
the
distressed
compassionate
a
poor
wandering
young
man
who
flies
to
you
for
refuge
lost
to
his
native
home
lost
to
his
fame
his
fortune
and
his
friends
and
has
only
left
him
the
knowledge
of
his
innocence
to
support
him
from
falling
on
his
own
sword
to
end
an
unfortunate
life
pursued
every
where
and
safe
no
where
a
life
whose
only
refuge
is
goodness
nor
is
it
barely
to
preserve
this
life
that
i
have
recourse
to
that
only
as
my
sanctuary
and
like
an
humble
slave
implore
your
pity
oh
pity
my
youth
and
intercede
for
my
stay
yet
a
little
longer
yourself
makes
one
of
the
illustrious
number
of
the
grave
the
wise
and
mighty
council
your
uncle
and
relations
make
up
another
considerable
part
of
it
and
you
are
too
dear
to
all
to
find
a
refusal
of
your
just
and
compassionate
application
oh
what
fault
have
i
committed
against
you
that
i
should
not
find
a
safety
here
as
well
as
those
charged
with
the
same
crime
with
me
though
of
less
quality
many
i
have
encountered
here
of
our
unlucky
party
who
find
a
safety
among
you
is
my
birth
a
crime
or
does
the
greatness
of
that
augment
my
guilt
have
i
broken
any
of
your
laws
committed
any
outrage
do
they
suspect
me
for
a
spy
to
or
do
i
hold
any
correspondence
with
that
ungrateful
nation
does
my
religion
principle
or
opinion
differ
from
yours
can
i
design
the
subversion
of
your
glorious
state
can
i
plot
cabal
or
mutiny
alone
oh
charge
me
with
some
offence
or
yourselves
of
injustice
say
why
am
i
denied
my
length
of
earth
amongst
you
if
i
die
or
why
to
breathe
the
open
air
if
i
live
since
i
shall
neither
oppress
the
one
nor
infect
the
other
but
on
the
contrary
am
ready
with
my
sword
my
youth
and
blood
to
serve
you
and
bring
my
little
aids
on
all
occasions
to
yours
and
should
be
proud
of
the
glory
to
die
for
you
in
battle
who
would
deliver
me
up
a
sacrifice
to
oh
where
is
the
glory
or
virtue
of
this
for
it
is
no
other
there
are
no
laws
that
bind
you
to
it
no
obligatory
article
of
nations
but
an
unnecessary
compliment
made
a
of
your
senate
that
argues
nothing
but
ill
nature
and
can
not
redound
to
any
one
s
advantage
an
ill
nature
that
s
levelled
at
me
alone
for
many
i
found
here
and
many
shall
leave
under
the
same
circumstances
with
me
it
is
only
me
whom
you
have
marked
out
the
victim
to
atone
for
all
well
then
my
lord
if
nothing
can
move
you
to
a
safety
for
this
unfortunate
at
least
be
so
merciful
to
suspend
your
cruelty
a
little
yet
a
little
and
possibly
i
shall
render
you
the
body
of
though
dead
to
send
into
as
the
trophy
of
your
fidelity
to
that
crown
oh
yet
a
little
stay
your
cruel
sentence
till
my
lovely
sister
who
pursued
my
hard
fortunes
declare
my
fate
by
her
life
or
death
oh
my
lord
if
ever
the
soft
passion
of
love
have
touched
your
soul
if
you
have
felt
the
unresistible
force
of
young
charms
about
your
heart
if
ever
you
have
known
a
pain
and
pleasure
from
fair
eyes
or
the
transporting
joys
of
beauty
pity
a
youth
undone
by
love
and
ambition
those
powerful
conquerors
of
the
young
pity
oh
pity
a
youth
that
dies
and
will
ere
long
no
more
complain
upon
your
rigours
yes
my
lord
he
dies
without
the
force
of
a
terrifying
sentence
without
the
grim
reproaches
of
an
angry
judge
without
the
soon
consulted
arbitrary
guilty
of
a
severe
and
hasty
jury
without
the
ceremony
of
the
scaffold
axe
and
hangman
and
the
clamours
of
inconsidering
crowds
all
which
melancholy
ceremonies
render
death
so
terrible
which
else
would
fall
like
gentle
slumbers
upon
the
and
which
in
field
i
would
encounter
with
that
joy
i
would
the
sacred
thing
i
love
but
oh
i
fear
my
fate
is
in
the
lovely
and
in
her
dying
eyes
you
may
read
it
in
her
languishing
face
you
will
see
how
near
it
is
approached
ah
will
you
not
suffer
me
to
attend
it
there
by
her
dear
side
i
shall
fall
as
calmly
as
flowers
from
their
stalks
without
regret
or
pain
will
you
by
forcing
me
to
die
from
her
run
me
to
a
madness
to
wild
distraction
oh
think
it
sufficient
that
i
die
here
before
half
my
race
of
youth
be
run
before
the
light
be
half
burnt
out
that
might
have
conducted
me
to
a
world
of
glory
alas
she
lovely
dies
she
is
sighing
out
a
soul
to
which
mine
is
so
entirely
fixed
that
they
must
go
upward
together
yes
yes
she
breathes
it
sick
into
my
bosom
and
kindly
gives
mine
its
disease
of
death
let
us
at
least
then
die
in
silence
quietly
and
if
it
please
heaven
to
restore
the
languished
charmer
i
will
resign
myself
up
to
all
your
rigorous
honour
only
let
me
bear
my
treasure
with
me
while
we
wander
over
the
world
to
seek
us
out
a
safety
in
some
part
of
it
where
pity
and
compassion
is
no
crime
where
men
have
tender
hearts
and
have
heard
of
the
god
of
love
where
politics
are
not
all
the
business
of
the
powerful
but
where
civility
and
good
nature
reign
perhaps
my
lord
you
will
wonder
i
plead
no
weightier
argument
for
my
stay
than
love
or
the
griefs
and
tears
of
a
languishing
maid
but
oh
they
are
such
tears
as
every
drop
would
ransom
lives
and
nothing
that
proceeds
from
her
charming
eyes
can
be
valued
at
a
less
rate
in
pity
to
her
to
me
and
your
amorous
youths
let
me
bear
her
hence
for
should
she
look
abroad
as
her
own
sex
should
she
appear
in
her
natural
and
proper
beauty
alas
they
were
undone
reproach
not
my
lord
the
weakness
of
this
confession
and
which
i
make
with
more
glory
than
could
i
boast
myself
lord
of
all
the
universe
if
it
appear
a
fault
to
the
more
grave
and
wise
i
hope
my
youth
will
plead
something
for
my
excuse
oh
say
at
least
it
was
pity
that
love
had
the
ascendant
over
soul
say
it
was
his
destiny
but
say
withal
that
it
put
no
stop
to
his
advance
to
glory
rather
it
set
an
edge
upon
his
sword
and
gave
wings
to
his
ambition
yes
try
me
in
your
councils
prove
me
in
your
camps
place
me
in
any
hazard
but
give
me
love
and
leave
me
to
wait
the
life
or
death
of
and
then
dispose
as
you
please
my
lord
of
your
unfortunate
philander
octavio
philander
i
am
much
concerned
that
a
request
so
reasonable
as
you
have
made
will
be
of
so
little
force
with
these
arbitrary
tyrants
of
state
and
though
you
have
addressed
and
appealed
to
me
as
one
of
that
grave
and
rigid
number
though
without
one
grain
of
their
formalities
and
i
hope
age
which
renders
us
less
gallant
and
more
envious
of
the
joys
and
liberties
of
youth
will
never
reduce
me
to
so
dull
and
thoughtless
a
member
of
state
yet
i
have
so
small
and
single
a
portion
of
their
power
that
i
am
ashamed
of
my
incapacity
of
serving
you
in
this
great
affair
i
bear
the
honour
and
the
name
it
is
true
of
glorious
sway
but
i
can
boast
but
of
the
worst
and
most
impotent
part
of
it
the
title
only
but
the
busy
absolute
mischievous
politician
finds
no
room
in
my
soul
my
humour
or
constitution
and
plodding
restless
power
i
have
made
so
little
the
business
of
my
gayer
and
more
careless
youth
that
i
have
even
lost
my
right
of
rule
my
share
of
empire
amongst
them
that
little
power
whose
unregarded
loss
i
never
bemoaned
till
it
rendered
me
incapable
of
serving
i
have
stretched
to
the
utmost
bound
for
your
stay
insomuch
that
i
have
received
many
reproaches
from
the
wiser
coxcombs
have
made
my
youth
s
little
debauches
hinted
on
and
judgements
made
of
you
disadvantageous
from
my
friendship
to
you
a
friendship
which
my
lord
at
first
sight
of
you
found
a
being
in
my
soul
and
which
your
wit
your
goodness
your
greatness
and
your
misfortunes
have
improved
to
all
the
degrees
of
it
though
i
am
infinitely
unhappy
that
it
proves
of
no
use
to
you
here
and
that
the
greatest
testimony
i
can
now
render
of
it
is
to
warn
you
of
your
approaching
danger
and
hasten
your
departure
for
there
is
no
safety
in
your
stay
i
just
now
heard
what
was
decreed
against
you
in
council
which
no
pleading
nor
eloquence
of
friendship
had
force
enough
to
evade
alas
i
had
but
one
single
voice
in
the
number
which
i
sullenly
and
singly
gave
and
which
unregarded
passed
go
then
my
lord
haste
to
some
place
where
good
breeding
and
humanity
reigns
go
and
preserve
in
providing
for
your
own
safety
and
believe
me
till
she
be
in
a
condition
to
pursue
your
fortunes
i
will
take
such
care
that
nothing
shall
be
wanting
to
her
recovery
here
in
order
to
her
following
after
you
i
am
alas
but
too
sensible
of
all
the
pains
you
must
endure
by
such
a
separation
for
i
am
neither
insensible
nor
incapable
of
love
or
any
of
its
violent
effects
go
then
my
lord
and
preserve
the
lovely
maid
in
your
flight
since
your
stay
and
danger
will
serve
but
to
hasten
on
her
death
go
and
be
satisfied
she
shall
find
a
protection
suitable
to
her
sex
her
innocence
her
beauty
and
her
quality
and
that
wherever
you
fix
your
stay
she
shall
be
resigned
to
your
arms
by
my
lord
your
eternal
friend
and
humble
servant
octavio
in
this
sudden
remove
you
should
want
money
i
have
sent
you
several
bills
of
exchange
to
what
place
soever
you
arrive
and
what
you
want
more
make
no
scruple
to
use
me
as
a
friend
and
after
this
letter
finding
no
hopes
but
on
the
contrary
a
dire
necessity
of
departing
he
told
his
misfortune
and
asked
his
counsel
in
this
extremity
of
affairs
who
of
a
servant
was
become
a
rival
you
may
believe
gave
him
such
advice
as
might
remove
him
from
the
object
he
adored
but
after
a
great
deal
of
dissembled
trouble
the
better
to
hide
his
joy
he
gave
his
advice
for
his
going
with
all
the
arguments
that
appeared
reasonable
enough
to
and
at
every
period
urged
that
his
life
being
dear
to
and
on
which
hers
so
immediately
depended
he
ought
no
longer
to
debate
but
hasten
his
flight
to
all
which
counsel
our
amorous
hero
with
a
soul
ready
to
make
its
way
through
his
trembling
body
gave
a
sighing
unwilling
assent
it
was
now
no
longer
a
dispute
but
was
concluded
he
must
go
but
how
was
the
only
question
how
should
he
take
his
farewell
how
he
should
bid
adieu
and
leave
the
dear
object
of
his
soul
in
an
estate
so
hazardous
he
formed
a
thousand
sad
ideas
to
torment
himself
with
fancying
he
should
never
see
her
more
that
he
should
hear
that
she
was
dead
though
now
she
appeared
on
this
side
the
grave
and
had
all
the
signs
of
a
declining
disease
he
fancied
absence
might
make
her
cold
and
abate
her
passion
to
him
that
her
powerful
beauty
might
attract
adorers
and
she
being
but
a
woman
and
no
part
angel
but
her
form
not
expected
she
should
want
her
sex
s
frailties
now
he
could
consider
how
he
had
won
her
how
by
importunity
and
opportunity
she
had
at
last
yielded
to
him
and
therefore
might
to
some
new
gamester
when
he
was
not
by
to
keep
her
heart
in
continual
play
then
it
was
that
all
the
despair
of
jealous
love
the
throbs
and
piercing
of
a
violent
passion
seized
his
timorous
and
tender
heart
he
fancied
her
already
in
some
new
lover
s
arms
and
ran
over
all
these
soft
enjoyments
he
had
with
her
and
fancied
with
tormenting
thought
that
so
another
would
possess
her
till
racked
with
tortures
he
almost
fainted
on
the
repose
on
which
he
was
set
but
roused
and
endeavoured
to
convince
him
told
him
he
hoped
his
fear
was
needless
and
that
he
would
take
all
the
watchful
care
imaginable
of
her
conduct
be
a
spy
upon
her
virtue
and
from
time
to
time
give
him
notice
of
all
that
should
pass
bid
him
consider
her
quality
and
that
she
was
no
common
mistress
whom
hire
could
lead
astray
and
that
if
from
the
violence
of
her
passion
or
her
most
severe
fate
she
had
yielded
to
the
most
charming
of
men
he
ought
as
little
to
imagine
she
could
be
again
a
lover
as
that
she
could
find
an
object
of
equal
beauty
with
that
of
in
fine
he
soothed
and
flattered
him
into
so
much
ease
that
he
resolves
to
take
his
leave
for
a
day
or
two
under
pretence
of
meeting
and
consulting
with
some
of
the
rebel
party
and
that
he
would
return
again
to
her
by
that
time
it
might
be
imagined
her
fever
might
be
abated
and
in
a
condition
to
receive
the
news
of
his
being
gone
for
a
longer
time
and
to
know
all
his
affairs
while
prepared
all
things
necessary
for
his
departure
went
to
from
whom
having
been
absent
two
tedious
hours
she
caught
him
in
her
arms
with
a
transport
of
joy
reproached
him
with
want
of
love
for
being
absent
so
long
but
still
the
more
she
spoke
soft
sighing
words
of
love
the
more
his
soul
was
seized
with
melancholy
his
sighs
redoubled
and
he
could
not
refrain
from
letting
fall
some
tears
upon
her
bosom
which
perceiving
with
a
look
and
a
trembling
in
her
voice
that
spoke
her
fears
she
cried
oh
these
are
unusual
marks
of
your
tenderness
oh
tell
me
tell
me
quickly
what
they
he
answered
with
a
sigh
and
she
went
on
it
is
so
i
am
undone
it
is
your
lost
vows
your
broken
faith
you
weep
yes
you
find
the
flower
of
my
beauty
faded
and
what
you
loved
before
you
pity
now
and
these
be
the
effects
of
then
sighing
as
if
his
soul
had
been
departing
on
her
neck
he
cried
by
heaven
by
all
the
powers
of
love
thou
art
the
same
dear
charmer
that
thou
wert
then
pressing
her
body
to
his
bosom
he
sighed
anew
as
if
his
heart
were
breaking
i
know
says
she
there
is
some
hidden
cause
that
gives
these
sighs
their
way
and
that
dear
face
a
paleness
oh
tell
me
all
for
she
that
could
abandon
all
for
thee
can
dare
the
worst
of
fate
if
thou
must
quit
me
oh
if
it
must
be
so
i
need
not
stay
the
lingering
death
of
a
feeble
fever
i
know
a
way
more
noble
and
more
pleased
at
her
resolution
which
almost
destroyed
his
jealousy
and
fears
a
thousand
times
he
kissed
her
mixing
his
grateful
words
and
thanks
with
sighs
and
finding
her
fair
hands
which
he
put
often
to
his
mouth
to
increase
their
fires
and
her
pulse
to
be
more
high
and
quick
fearing
to
relapse
her
into
her
abating
fever
he
forced
a
smile
and
told
her
he
had
no
griefs
but
what
she
made
him
feel
no
torments
but
her
sickness
nor
sighs
but
for
her
pain
and
left
nothing
unsaid
that
might
confirm
her
he
was
still
more
and
more
her
slave
and
concealing
his
design
in
favour
of
her
health
he
ceased
not
vowing
and
protesting
till
he
had
settled
her
in
all
the
tranquillity
of
a
recovering
beauty
and
as
since
her
first
illness
he
had
never
departed
from
her
bed
so
now
this
night
he
strove
to
appear
in
her
arms
with
all
that
usual
gaiety
of
love
that
her
condition
would
permit
or
his
circumstances
could
feign
and
leaving
her
asleep
at
with
a
force
upon
his
soul
that
can
not
be
conceived
but
by
parting
lovers
he
stole
from
her
arms
and
retiring
to
his
chamber
he
soon
got
himself
ready
for
his
flight
and
departed
we
will
leave
ravings
to
be
expressed
by
none
but
herself
and
tell
you
that
after
about
fourteen
days
absence
received
this
letter
from
philander
octavio
being
safely
arrived
at
and
by
a
very
pretty
and
lucky
adventure
lodged
in
the
house
of
the
best
quality
in
the
town
i
find
myself
much
more
at
ease
than
i
thought
it
possible
to
be
without
from
whom
i
am
nevertheless
impatient
to
hear
i
hope
absence
appears
not
so
great
a
bugbear
to
her
as
it
was
imagined
for
i
know
not
what
effects
it
would
have
on
me
to
hear
her
griefs
exceeded
a
few
sighs
and
tears
those
my
kind
absence
has
taught
me
to
allow
and
bear
without
much
pain
but
should
her
love
transport
her
to
extremes
of
rage
and
despair
i
fear
i
should
quit
my
safety
here
and
give
her
the
last
proof
of
my
love
and
my
compassion
throw
myself
at
her
feet
and
expose
my
life
to
preserve
hers
honour
would
oblige
me
to
it
i
conjure
you
my
dear
by
all
the
friendship
you
have
vowed
me
and
which
i
no
longer
doubt
let
me
speedily
know
how
she
bears
my
absence
for
on
that
knowledge
depends
a
great
deal
of
the
satisfaction
of
my
life
carry
her
this
enclosed
which
i
have
writ
her
and
soften
my
silent
departure
which
possibly
may
appear
rude
and
unkind
plead
my
pardon
and
give
her
the
story
of
my
necessity
of
offending
which
none
can
so
well
relate
as
yourself
and
from
a
mouth
so
eloquent
to
a
maid
so
full
of
love
will
soon
reconcile
me
to
her
heart
with
her
letter
i
send
you
a
bill
to
pay
her
patacons
which
i
have
paid
here
as
his
letter
will
inform
you
as
also
those
bills
i
received
of
you
at
my
departure
having
been
supplied
by
an
merchant
here
who
gave
me
credit
it
will
be
an
age
till
i
hear
from
you
and
receive
the
news
of
the
health
of
than
which
two
blessings
nothing
will
be
more
welcome
to
generous
your
philander
your
letters
for
me
to
your
vander
hanskin
philander
sylvia
there
is
no
way
left
to
gain
my
pardon
for
leaving
her
and
leaving
her
in
such
circumstances
but
to
tell
her
it
was
to
preserve
a
life
which
i
believed
entirely
dear
to
her
but
that
unhappy
crime
is
too
severely
punished
by
the
cruelties
of
my
absence
believe
me
lovely
i
have
felt
all
your
pains
i
have
burnt
with
your
fever
and
sighed
with
your
oppressions
say
has
my
pain
abated
yours
tell
me
and
hasten
my
health
by
the
assurance
of
your
recovery
or
i
have
fled
in
vain
from
those
dear
arms
to
save
my
life
of
which
i
know
not
what
account
to
give
you
till
i
receive
from
you
the
knowledge
of
your
perfect
health
the
true
state
of
mine
i
can
only
say
i
sigh
and
have
a
sort
of
a
being
in
where
i
have
some
more
assurance
of
protection
than
i
could
hope
i
from
those
interested
brutes
who
sent
me
from
you
yet
brutish
as
they
are
i
know
thou
art
safe
from
their
clownish
outrages
for
were
they
senseless
as
their
of
the
sea
they
durst
not
profane
so
pure
an
excellence
as
thine
the
sullen
boars
would
jouder
out
a
welcome
to
thee
and
gape
i
and
wonder
at
thy
awful
beauty
though
they
want
the
tender
sense
to
know
to
what
use
it
was
made
or
if
i
doubted
their
humanity
i
can
not
the
friendship
of
since
he
has
given
me
too
good
a
proof
of
it
to
leave
me
any
fear
that
he
has
not
in
my
absence
pursued
those
generous
sentiments
for
which
he
vowed
to
and
of
which
this
first
proof
must
be
his
relating
the
necessity
of
my
absence
to
set
me
well
with
my
adorable
maid
who
better
than
i
can
inform
her
and
that
i
rather
chose
to
quit
you
only
for
a
short
space
than
reduce
myself
to
the
necessity
of
losing
you
eternally
let
the
satisfaction
this
ought
to
give
you
retrieve
your
health
and
beauty
and
put
you
into
a
condition
of
restoring
to
me
all
my
joys
that
by
pursuing
the
dictates
of
your
love
you
may
again
bring
the
greatest
happiness
on
earth
to
the
arms
of
your
philander
postscript
affairs
here
are
yet
so
unsettled
that
i
can
take
no
order
for
your
coming
to
me
but
as
soon
as
i
know
where
i
can
fix
with
safety
i
shall
make
it
my
business
and
my
happiness
adieu
with
your
letters
this
letter
would
not
carry
himself
to
her
who
had
omitted
no
day
scarce
an
hour
wherein
he
saw
not
or
sent
not
to
the
charming
but
he
found
in
that
which
had
writ
to
him
an
air
of
coldness
altogether
unusual
with
that
passionate
lover
and
infinitely
short
in
point
of
tenderness
to
those
he
had
formerly
seen
of
his
and
from
what
he
had
heard
him
speak
so
that
he
no
longer
doubted
and
the
rather
because
he
hoped
it
but
that
found
an
abatement
of
that
heat
which
was
wont
to
inspire
at
a
more
amorous
rate
this
appearing
declension
he
could
not
conceal
from
at
least
to
let
her
know
he
took
notice
of
it
for
he
knew
her
love
was
too
and
sensible
to
pass
it
unregarded
but
he
with
reason
thought
that
when
she
should
find
others
observe
the
little
slight
she
had
put
on
her
her
pride
which
is
natural
to
women
in
such
cases
would
decline
and
lessen
her
love
for
his
rival
he
therefore
sent
his
page
with
the
letters
enclosed
in
this
from
himself
octavio
sylvia
from
a
little
necessary
debauch
i
made
last
night
with
the
prince
i
am
forced
to
employ
my
page
in
those
duties
i
ought
to
have
performed
myself
he
brings
you
madam
a
letter
from
as
mine
which
i
have
also
sent
you
informs
me
i
should
else
have
doubted
it
it
is
i
think
his
character
and
all
he
says
of
confesses
the
friend
but
where
he
speaks
of
sure
he
disguises
the
lover
i
wonder
the
mask
should
be
put
on
now
to
me
to
whom
before
he
so
frankly
discovered
the
secrets
of
his
amorous
heart
it
is
a
mystery
i
would
fain
persuade
myself
he
finds
absolutely
necessary
to
his
interest
and
i
hope
you
will
make
the
same
favourable
constructions
of
it
and
not
impute
the
lessened
zeal
wherewith
he
treats
the
charming
to
any
possible
change
or
coldness
since
i
am
but
too
fatally
sensible
that
no
man
can
arrive
at
the
glory
of
being
beloved
by
you
that
had
ever
power
to
shorten
one
link
of
that
dear
chain
that
holds
him
and
you
need
but
survey
that
adorable
face
to
confirm
your
tranquillity
set
a
just
value
on
your
charms
and
you
need
no
arguments
to
secure
your
everlasting
empire
or
to
establish
it
in
what
heart
you
please
this
fatal
truth
i
learned
from
your
fair
eyes
ere
they
discovered
to
me
your
sex
and
you
may
as
soon
change
to
what
i
then
believed
you
as
i
from
adoring
what
i
now
find
you
if
all
then
madam
that
do
but
look
on
you
become
your
slaves
and
languish
for
you
love
on
even
without
hope
and
die
what
must
pay
you
who
has
the
mighty
blessing
of
your
love
your
vows
and
all
that
renders
the
hours
of
amorous
youth
sacred
glad
and
triumphant
but
you
know
the
conquering
power
of
your
charms
too
well
to
need
either
this
daring
confession
or
a
defence
of
virtue
from
madam
your
obedient
slave
octavio
had
no
sooner
read
this
with
blushes
and
a
thousand
fears
and
trembling
of
what
was
to
follow
in
letters
both
to
and
to
herself
but
with
an
indignation
agreeable
to
her
haughty
soul
she
cried
how
slighted
and
must
see
it
too
by
heaven
if
i
should
find
it
true
he
shall
not
dare
to
think
then
with
a
generous
rage
she
broke
open
letter
and
which
she
soon
perceived
did
but
too
well
prove
the
truth
of
suspicion
and
her
own
fears
she
repeated
it
again
and
again
and
still
she
found
more
cause
of
grief
and
anger
love
occasioned
the
first
and
pride
the
last
and
to
a
soul
perfectly
haughty
as
was
that
of
it
was
hard
to
guess
which
had
the
ascendant
she
considered
to
all
the
advantages
that
thought
could
conceive
in
one
who
was
not
a
lover
of
him
she
knew
he
merited
a
heart
though
she
had
none
to
give
him
she
found
him
charming
without
having
a
tenderness
for
him
she
found
him
young
and
amorous
without
desire
towards
him
she
found
him
great
rich
powerful
and
generous
without
designing
on
him
and
though
she
knew
her
soul
free
from
all
passion
but
that
for
nevertheless
she
blushed
and
was
angry
that
he
had
thoughts
no
more
advantageous
to
the
power
of
those
charms
which
she
wish
d
might
appear
to
him
above
her
sex
it
being
natural
to
women
to
desire
conquests
though
they
hate
the
conquered
to
glory
in
the
triumph
though
they
despise
the
slave
and
she
believed
while
had
so
poor
a
sense
of
her
beauty
as
to
believe
it
could
be
forsaken
he
would
adore
it
less
and
first
to
satisfy
her
pride
she
left
the
softer
business
of
her
heart
to
the
next
tormenting
hour
and
sent
him
this
careless
answer
by
his
page
believing
if
she
valued
his
opinion
and
therefore
dissembled
her
thoughts
as
women
in
those
cases
ever
do
who
when
most
angry
seem
the
most
galliard
especially
when
they
have
need
of
the
friendship
of
those
they
flatter
sylvia
octavio
is
it
indeed
that
you
believe
cold
or
would
you
make
that
a
pretext
to
the
declaration
of
your
own
passion
we
ladies
are
not
so
nicely
tied
up
to
the
formalities
of
virtue
but
we
can
hear
love
at
both
ears
and
if
we
receive
not
the
addresses
of
both
at
least
we
are
perhaps
vain
enough
not
to
be
displeased
to
find
we
make
new
conquests
but
you
have
made
your
attack
with
so
ill
conduct
that
i
shall
find
force
enough
without
more
aids
to
repulse
you
alas
my
lord
did
you
believe
my
heart
was
left
unguarded
when
departed
no
the
careful
charming
lover
left
a
thousand
little
gods
to
defend
it
of
no
less
power
than
himself
young
deities
who
laugh
at
all
your
little
arts
and
treacheries
and
scorn
to
resign
their
empire
to
any
feeble
you
can
draw
up
against
them
your
thick
foggy
air
breeds
love
too
dull
and
heavy
for
noble
flights
nor
can
i
stoop
to
them
the
boy
wants
arrows
keen
enough
for
hearts
like
mine
and
is
a
bungler
in
his
art
too
lazy
and
remiss
rather
a
heavy
than
a
a
bottle
sends
him
to
his
bed
of
moss
where
he
sleeps
hard
and
never
dreams
of
how
poorly
have
you
paid
yourself
my
lord
by
this
pursuit
of
your
discovered
love
for
all
the
little
friendship
you
have
rendered
me
how
well
you
have
explained
you
can
be
no
more
a
lover
than
a
friend
if
one
may
judge
the
first
by
the
last
had
you
been
thus
obstinate
in
your
passion
before
went
or
you
had
believed
me
abandoned
i
should
perhaps
have
thought
that
you
had
loved
indeed
because
i
should
have
seen
you
durst
and
should
have
believed
it
true
because
it
ran
some
hazards
for
me
the
resolution
of
it
would
have
reconciled
me
then
to
the
temerity
of
it
and
the
greatest
demonstration
you
could
have
given
of
it
would
have
been
the
danger
you
would
have
ran
and
contemned
and
the
preference
of
your
passion
above
any
other
consideration
this
my
lord
had
been
generous
and
like
a
lover
but
poorly
thus
to
set
upon
a
single
woman
in
the
disguise
of
a
friend
in
the
dark
silent
melancholy
hour
of
absence
from
then
to
surprise
me
then
to
bid
me
deliver
to
pad
for
hearts
it
is
not
like
that
made
his
friend
and
for
whose
dear
sake
my
lord
i
will
no
farther
reproach
you
but
from
a
goodness
which
i
hope
you
will
merit
i
will
forgive
an
offence
which
your
has
rendered
almost
inexcusable
and
expect
you
will
for
the
future
consider
better
how
you
ought
to
treat
sylvia
as
soon
as
she
had
dismissed
the
page
she
hasted
to
her
business
of
love
and
again
read
over
letter
and
finding
still
new
occasion
for
fear
she
had
recourse
to
pen
and
paper
for
a
relief
of
that
heart
which
no
other
way
could
find
and
after
having
wiped
the
tears
from
her
eyes
she
writ
this
following
letter
sylvia
philander
yes
i
have
received
your
letter
and
but
i
found
my
name
there
should
have
hoped
it
was
not
meant
for
oh
it
is
all
cold
short
short
and
cold
as
a
dead
winter
s
day
it
chilled
my
blood
it
shivered
every
vein
where
oh
where
hast
thou
lavished
out
all
those
soft
words
so
natural
to
thy
soul
with
which
thou
usedst
to
charm
so
tuned
to
the
dear
music
of
thy
voice
what
is
become
of
all
the
tender
things
which
as
i
used
to
read
made
little
nimble
pantings
in
my
heart
my
blushes
rise
and
tremblings
in
my
blood
adding
new
fire
to
the
poor
burning
victim
oh
where
are
all
thy
pretty
flatteries
of
love
that
made
me
fond
and
vain
and
set
a
value
on
this
trifling
beauty
hast
thou
forgot
thy
wondrous
art
of
loving
thy
pretty
cunnings
and
thy
soft
deceivings
hast
thou
forgot
them
all
or
hast
thou
forgot
indeed
to
love
at
all
has
thy
industrious
passion
gathered
all
the
sweets
and
left
the
rifled
flower
to
hang
its
withered
head
and
die
in
i
shades
neglected
for
who
will
prize
it
now
now
when
all
its
i
perfumes
are
fled
oh
my
oh
my
charming
fugitive
was
it
not
enough
you
left
me
like
false
on
the
shore
on
the
forsaken
shore
departed
from
my
fond
my
clasping
arms
where
i
believed
you
safe
secure
and
pleased
when
sleep
and
night
that
favoured
you
and
ruined
me
had
rendered
them
incapable
of
their
dear
loss
oh
was
it
not
enough
that
when
i
found
them
empty
and
abandoned
and
the
place
cold
where
you
had
lain
and
my
poor
trembling
bosom
unpossessed
of
that
dear
load
it
bore
that
i
almost
expired
with
my
first
fears
oh
if
loved
he
would
have
thought
that
cruelty
enough
without
the
sad
addition
of
a
growing
coldness
i
awaked
i
missed
thee
and
i
called
aloud
my
but
no
philander
heard
then
drew
the
curtains
and
with
a
hasty
and
busy
view
surveyed
the
chamber
over
but
oh
in
vain
i
viewed
and
called
yet
louder
but
none
appeared
to
my
assistance
but
and
to
torture
me
with
dull
excuses
urging
a
thousand
feigned
and
frivolous
reasons
to
satisfy
my
fears
but
i
who
loved
who
doted
even
to
madness
by
nature
soft
and
timorous
as
a
dove
and
fearful
as
a
criminal
escaped
that
dreads
each
little
noise
fancied
their
eyes
and
guilty
looks
confessed
the
treasons
of
their
hearts
and
tongues
while
they
more
kind
than
true
strove
to
convince
my
killing
doubts
protested
that
you
would
return
by
night
and
feigned
a
likely
story
to
deceive
thus
between
hope
and
fear
i
languished
out
a
day
oh
heavens
a
tedious
day
without
who
would
have
thought
that
such
a
dismal
day
should
not
with
the
end
of
its
reign
have
finished
that
of
my
life
but
then
came
to
visit
me
and
who
till
then
i
never
wished
to
see
but
now
i
was
impatient
for
his
coming
who
by
degrees
told
me
that
you
were
gone
i
never
asked
him
where
or
how
or
why
that
you
were
gone
was
enough
to
possess
me
of
all
i
feared
your
being
apprehended
and
sent
into
your
delivering
yourself
up
your
abandoning
me
all
all
i
had
an
easy
faith
for
without
consulting
more
than
that
thou
wert
gone
that
very
word
yet
strikes
a
terror
to
my
soul
disables
my
trembling
hand
and
i
must
wait
for
reinforcements
from
some
kinder
thoughts
but
oh
from
whence
should
they
arrive
from
what
dear
present
felicity
or
prospect
of
a
future
though
never
so
distant
and
all
those
past
ones
serve
but
to
increase
my
pain
they
favour
me
no
more
they
charm
and
please
no
more
and
only
present
themselves
to
my
memory
to
complete
the
number
of
my
sighs
and
tears
and
make
me
wish
that
they
had
never
been
though
even
with
oh
say
thou
monarch
of
my
panting
soul
how
hast
thou
treated
to
make
her
wish
that
she
had
never
known
a
tender
joy
with
thee
is
it
possible
she
should
repent
her
loving
thee
and
thou
shouldst
give
her
cause
say
dear
false
charmer
is
it
but
oh
there
is
no
lasting
faith
in
sin
ah
what
have
i
done
how
dreadful
is
the
scene
of
my
first
debauch
and
how
glorious
that
never
to
be
regained
prospect
of
my
virgin
innocence
where
i
sat
enthroned
in
awful
virtue
crowned
with
shining
honour
and
adorned
with
unsullied
reputation
till
thou
o
tyrant
with
a
charming
usurpation
invaded
all
my
glories
and
which
i
resigned
with
greater
pride
and
joy
than
a
young
monarch
puts
them
on
oh
why
then
do
i
repent
as
if
the
vast
the
dear
expense
of
pleasures
past
were
not
enough
to
recompense
for
all
the
pains
of
love
to
come
but
why
oh
why
do
i
treat
thee
as
a
lover
lost
already
thou
art
not
canst
not
no
i
will
not
believe
it
till
thou
thyself
confess
it
nor
shall
the
omission
of
a
tender
word
or
two
make
me
believe
thou
hast
forgot
thy
vows
alas
it
may
be
i
mistake
thy
cares
thy
hard
fatigues
of
life
thy
present
ill
circumstances
and
all
the
melancholy
effects
of
thine
and
my
misfortunes
for
coldness
and
declining
love
alas
i
had
forgot
my
poor
my
dear
is
now
obliged
to
contrive
for
life
as
well
as
love
thou
perhaps
fearing
the
worst
are
preparing
eloquence
for
a
council
table
and
in
thy
busy
and
guilty
imaginations
haranguing
it
to
the
grave
judges
defending
thy
innocence
or
evading
thy
guilt
feeing
advocates
excepting
juries
and
confronting
witnesses
when
thou
shouldst
be
giving
satisfaction
to
my
fainting
heart
sometimes
in
thy
labouring
fancy
the
horror
of
a
dreadful
sentence
for
an
ignominious
death
strikes
upon
thy
tender
soul
with
a
force
that
frights
the
little
god
from
thence
and
i
am
persuaded
there
are
some
moments
of
this
melancholy
nature
wherein
your
is
even
quite
forgotten
and
this
too
she
can
think
just
and
reasonable
without
reproaching
thy
heart
with
a
declining
passion
especially
when
i
am
not
by
to
call
thy
fondness
up
and
divert
thy
more
tormenting
hours
but
oh
for
those
soft
minutes
thou
hast
designed
for
love
and
hast
dedicated
to
should
dismiss
the
dull
formalities
of
rigid
business
the
pressing
cares
of
dangers
and
have
given
a
loose
to
softness
could
my
imagine
this
short
and
unloving
letter
sufficient
to
atone
for
such
an
absence
and
has
then
forgotten
the
pain
with
which
i
languished
when
but
absent
from
him
an
hour
how
then
can
he
imagine
i
can
live
when
distant
from
him
so
many
leagues
and
so
many
days
while
all
the
scanty
comfort
i
have
for
life
is
that
one
day
we
might
meet
again
but
where
or
when
or
hast
not
love
enough
so
much
as
to
divine
but
poorly
leavest
me
to
be
satisfied
by
committing
the
business
of
thy
heart
the
once
great
importance
of
thy
soul
the
most
necessary
devoirs
of
thy
life
to
be
supplied
by
another
oh
i
have
known
a
blessed
time
in
our
reign
of
love
when
thou
wouldst
have
thought
even
all
thy
own
power
of
too
little
force
to
satisfy
the
doubting
soul
of
tell
me
hast
thou
forgot
that
time
i
dare
not
think
thou
hast
and
yet
o
god
i
find
an
alteration
but
heaven
divert
the
omen
yet
something
whispers
to
my
soul
i
am
undone
oh
where
art
thou
my
where
is
thy
heart
and
what
has
it
been
doing
since
it
begun
my
fate
how
can
it
justify
thy
coldness
and
thou
this
cruel
absence
without
accounting
with
me
for
every
parting
hour
my
charming
dear
was
wont
to
find
me
business
for
all
my
lonely
absent
ones
and
writ
the
softest
letters
loading
the
paper
with
fond
vows
and
wishes
which
ere
i
had
read
over
another
would
arrive
to
keep
eternal
warmth
about
my
soul
nor
wert
thou
ever
wearied
more
with
writing
than
i
with
reading
or
with
sighing
after
thee
but
now
oh
there
is
some
mystery
in
it
i
dare
not
understand
be
kind
at
least
and
satisfy
my
fears
for
it
is
a
wondrous
pain
to
live
in
doubt
if
thou
still
lovest
me
swear
it
over
anew
and
curse
me
if
i
do
not
credit
thee
but
if
thou
art
declining
or
shouldst
be
sent
a
shameful
victim
into
oh
thou
deceiving
charmer
yet
be
just
and
let
me
know
my
doom
by
heaven
this
last
will
find
a
welcome
to
me
for
it
will
end
the
torment
of
my
doubts
and
fears
of
losing
thee
another
way
and
i
shall
have
the
joy
to
die
with
thee
die
beloved
and
die
thy
sylvia
having
read
over
this
letter
she
feared
she
had
said
too
much
of
her
doubts
and
apprehensions
of
a
change
in
him
for
now
she
flies
to
all
the
little
stratagems
and
artifices
of
lovers
she
begins
to
consider
the
worst
and
to
make
the
best
of
that
but
quite
abandoned
she
could
not
believe
herself
without
flying
into
all
the
rage
that
disappointed
woman
could
be
possessed
with
she
calls
shews
him
his
lord
s
letters
and
told
him
while
he
read
her
doubts
and
fears
he
being
thus
instructed
by
herself
in
the
way
how
to
deceive
her
on
like
who
gather
people
s
fortune
from
themselves
and
then
return
it
back
for
their
own
divinity
tells
her
he
saw
indeed
a
change
glad
to
improve
her
fear
and
feigns
a
sorrow
almost
equal
to
hers
it
is
evident
says
he
it
is
evident
that
he
is
the
most
ungrateful
of
his
sex
pardon
madam
continued
he
bowing
if
my
zeal
for
the
most
charming
creature
on
earth
make
me
forget
my
duty
to
the
best
of
masters
and
ah
cried
she
with
an
air
of
languishment
that
more
enflamed
him
have
a
care
lest
that
mistaken
zeal
for
me
should
make
you
profane
virtue
which
has
not
but
on
this
occasion
shewed
that
it
wanted
angels
for
its
guard
oh
if
he
be
false
if
the
dear
man
be
perjured
take
take
kind
heaven
the
life
you
have
preserved
but
for
a
greater
proof
of
your
revenge
and
at
that
word
she
sunk
into
his
arms
which
he
hastily
extended
as
she
was
falling
both
to
save
her
from
harm
and
to
give
himself
the
pleasure
of
grasping
the
loveliest
body
in
the
world
to
his
bosom
on
which
her
fair
face
declined
cold
dead
and
pale
but
so
transporting
was
the
pleasure
of
that
dear
burden
that
he
forgot
to
call
for
or
to
use
any
aid
to
bring
her
back
to
life
but
trembling
with
his
love
and
eager
passion
he
took
a
thousand
joys
he
kissed
a
thousand
times
her
lukewarm
lips
sucked
her
short
sighs
and
ravished
all
the
sweets
her
bosom
which
was
but
guarded
with
a
loose
yielded
his
impatient
touches
oh
heaven
who
can
express
the
pleasures
he
received
because
no
other
way
he
ever
could
arrive
to
so
much
daring
it
was
all
beyond
his
hope
loose
were
her
robes
insensible
the
maid
and
love
had
made
him
insolent
he
roved
he
kissed
he
gazed
without
control
forgetting
all
respect
of
persons
or
of
place
and
quite
despairing
by
fair
means
to
win
her
resolves
to
take
this
lucky
opportunity
the
door
he
knew
was
fast
for
the
counsel
she
had
to
ask
him
admitted
of
no
so
that
at
his
entrance
she
had
secured
the
pass
for
him
herself
and
being
near
her
bed
when
she
fell
into
his
arms
at
this
last
daring
thought
he
lifts
her
thither
and
lays
her
gently
down
and
while
he
did
so
in
one
minute
ran
over
all
the
killing
joys
he
had
been
witness
to
which
she
had
given
on
which
he
never
paus
d
but
urged
by
a
altogether
malicious
and
wicked
he
resolves
his
cowardly
conquest
when
some
kinder
god
awakened
and
brought
to
the
chamber
door
who
having
been
used
to
a
freedom
which
was
permitted
to
none
but
himself
with
her
woman
waiting
for
admittance
after
having
knocked
twice
softly
heard
it
and
redoubled
his
disorder
which
from
that
of
love
grew
to
that
of
surprise
he
knew
not
what
to
do
whether
to
refuse
answering
or
to
the
reviving
sense
of
in
this
moment
of
perplexing
thought
he
failed
not
however
to
set
his
hair
in
order
and
adjust
him
though
there
were
no
need
of
it
and
stepping
to
the
door
after
having
raised
leaning
her
head
on
her
hand
on
the
he
gave
admittance
to
but
oh
heaven
how
was
he
surprised
when
he
saw
it
was
his
heart
with
more
force
than
before
redoubled
its
beats
that
one
might
easily
perceive
every
stroke
by
the
motion
of
his
cravat
he
blushed
which
to
a
complexion
perfectly
fair
as
that
of
who
wants
no
beauty
either
in
face
or
person
was
the
more
discoverable
add
to
this
his
trembling
and
you
may
easily
imagine
what
a
figure
he
represented
himself
to
who
almost
as
much
surprised
as
himself
to
find
the
goddess
of
his
vows
and
devotions
with
a
young
alone
a
door
shut
to
her
gown
loose
which
from
the
late
fit
she
was
in
and
rape
upon
her
bosom
was
still
open
and
discovered
a
world
of
unguarded
beauty
which
she
knew
not
was
in
view
with
some
other
disorders
of
her
headcloths
gave
him
in
a
moment
a
thousand
false
apprehensions
was
no
less
surprised
so
that
all
had
their
part
of
amazement
but
the
innocent
whose
eyes
were
beautified
with
a
melancholy
calm
which
almost
set
the
generous
lover
at
ease
and
took
away
his
new
fears
however
he
could
not
choose
but
ask
what
the
matter
was
with
him
he
looked
so
out
of
countenance
and
trembled
so
he
told
him
how
had
been
and
what
extreme
frights
she
had
possessed
him
with
and
told
him
the
occasion
which
the
lovely
with
her
eyes
and
sighs
assented
to
and
departed
how
well
pleased
you
may
imagine
or
with
what
gusto
he
left
her
to
be
with
the
lovely
whom
he
perceived
too
well
was
a
lover
in
the
disguise
of
a
friend
but
there
are
in
love
those
wonderful
lovers
who
can
quench
the
fire
one
beauty
kindles
with
some
other
object
and
as
much
in
love
as
was
he
found
an
antidote
that
dispelled
the
grosser
part
of
it
for
she
was
in
love
with
our
amorous
friend
and
courted
him
with
that
passion
those
of
that
country
do
almost
all
handsome
strangers
and
one
convenient
principle
of
the
religion
of
that
country
is
to
think
it
no
sin
to
be
kind
while
they
are
single
women
though
otherwise
when
wives
they
are
just
enough
nor
does
a
woman
that
manages
her
affairs
thus
discreetly
meet
with
any
reproach
of
this
humour
was
our
who
pursued
her
lover
out
half
jealous
there
might
be
some
amorous
intrigue
between
her
lady
and
him
which
she
sought
in
vain
by
all
the
feeble
arts
of
her
country
s
sex
to
get
from
him
while
on
the
other
side
he
believing
she
might
be
of
use
in
the
farther
discovery
he
desired
to
make
between
and
not
only
told
her
she
herself
was
the
object
of
his
wishes
but
gave
her
substantial
proofs
on
it
and
told
her
his
design
after
having
her
honour
for
security
that
she
would
be
secret
the
best
pledge
a
man
can
take
of
a
woman
after
she
had
promised
to
betray
all
things
to
him
she
departed
to
her
affairs
and
he
to
giving
his
lord
an
account
of
as
he
desired
in
a
letter
which
came
to
him
with
that
of
and
which
was
thus
philander
brilliard
i
doubt
not
but
you
will
wonder
that
all
this
time
you
have
not
heard
of
me
nor
indeed
can
well
excuse
it
since
i
have
been
in
a
place
whence
with
ease
i
could
have
sent
every
post
but
a
new
affair
of
gallantry
has
engaged
my
thoughtful
hours
not
that
i
find
any
passion
here
that
has
abated
one
sigh
for
but
a
man
s
hours
are
very
dull
when
undiverted
by
an
intrigue
of
some
kind
or
other
especially
to
a
heart
young
and
gay
as
mine
is
and
which
would
not
if
possible
bend
under
the
fatigues
of
more
serious
thought
and
business
i
should
not
tell
you
this
but
that
i
would
have
you
say
all
the
dilatory
excuses
that
possibly
you
can
to
hinder
coming
to
me
while
i
remain
in
this
town
where
i
design
to
make
my
abode
but
a
short
time
and
had
not
stayed
at
all
but
for
this
stop
to
my
journey
and
i
scorn
to
be
vanquished
without
taking
my
revenge
it
is
a
sally
of
youth
no
more
a
flash
that
blazes
for
a
while
and
will
go
out
without
enjoyment
i
need
not
bid
you
keep
this
knowledge
to
yourself
for
i
have
had
too
good
a
confirmation
of
your
faith
and
friendship
to
doubt
you
now
and
believe
you
have
too
much
respect
for
to
occasion
her
any
disquiet
i
long
to
know
how
she
takes
my
absence
send
me
at
large
of
all
that
passes
and
give
your
letters
to
for
none
else
shall
know
where
i
am
or
how
to
send
to
me
be
careful
of
and
observe
her
with
diligence
for
possibly
i
should
not
be
extravagantly
afflicted
to
find
she
was
inclined
to
love
me
less
for
her
own
ease
and
mine
since
love
is
troublesome
when
the
height
of
it
carries
it
to
jealousies
little
quarrels
and
eternal
discontents
all
which
beginning
lovers
prize
and
pride
themselves
on
every
distrust
of
the
fond
mistress
since
it
is
not
only
a
demonstration
of
love
in
them
but
of
power
and
charms
in
us
that
occasion
it
but
when
we
no
longer
find
the
mistress
so
desirable
as
our
first
wishes
form
her
we
value
less
their
opinion
of
our
persons
and
only
endeavour
to
render
it
agreeable
to
new
beauties
and
adorn
it
for
new
conquests
but
you
have
been
a
lover
and
understand
already
this
philosophy
i
need
say
no
more
then
to
a
man
who
knows
so
well
my
soul
but
to
tell
him
i
am
his
constant
friend
philander
this
came
as
soul
could
wish
and
had
he
sent
him
word
he
had
been
chosen
king
of
he
could
not
have
received
the
news
with
so
great
joy
and
so
perfect
a
welcome
how
to
manage
this
to
his
best
advantage
was
the
business
he
was
next
to
consult
after
returning
an
answer
now
he
fancied
himself
sure
of
the
lovely
prize
in
spite
of
all
other
oppositions
for
says
he
in
reasoning
the
case
if
she
can
by
degrees
arrive
to
a
coldness
to
and
consider
him
no
longer
as
a
lover
she
may
perhaps
consider
me
as
a
husband
or
should
she
receive
addresses
when
once
i
have
found
her
feeble
i
will
make
her
pay
me
for
keeping
of
every
so
either
way
he
entertained
a
hope
though
never
so
distant
from
reason
and
probability
but
all
things
seem
possible
to
longing
lovers
who
can
on
the
least
hope
resolve
to
even
eternity
if
possible
in
expectation
of
a
promised
blessing
and
now
with
more
than
usual
care
he
resolved
to
dress
and
set
out
all
his
youth
and
beauty
to
the
best
advantage
and
being
a
gentleman
well
born
he
wanted
no
arts
of
dressing
nor
any
advantage
of
shape
or
mien
to
make
it
appear
well
pleased
with
this
hope
his
art
was
now
how
to
make
his
advances
without
appearing
to
have
designed
doing
so
and
first
to
act
the
hypocrite
with
his
lord
was
his
business
for
he
considered
rightly
if
he
should
not
represent
sorrows
to
the
life
and
appear
to
make
him
sensible
of
them
he
should
not
be
after
credited
if
he
related
any
thing
to
her
disadvantage
for
to
be
the
greater
enemy
you
ought
to
seem
to
be
the
greatest
friend
this
was
the
policy
of
his
heart
who
in
all
things
was
inspired
with
fanatical
notions
in
order
to
this
being
alone
in
his
chamber
after
the
defeat
he
had
in
that
of
he
writ
this
letter
brilliard
philander
lord
you
have
done
me
the
honour
to
make
me
your
confidant
in
an
affair
that
does
not
a
little
surprise
me
since
i
believed
after
no
mortal
beauty
could
have
touched
your
heart
and
nothing
but
your
own
excuses
could
have
sufficed
to
have
made
it
reasonable
and
i
only
wish
that
when
the
fatal
news
shall
arrive
to
ear
as
for
me
it
never
shall
that
she
may
think
it
as
pardonable
as
i
do
but
i
doubt
it
will
add
abundance
of
grief
to
what
she
is
already
possessed
of
if
but
such
a
fear
should
enter
in
her
tender
thoughts
but
since
it
is
not
my
business
my
lord
to
advise
or
counsel
but
to
obey
i
leave
you
to
all
the
success
of
happy
love
and
will
only
give
you
an
account
how
affairs
stand
here
since
your
departure
that
morning
you
left
the
and
in
bed
i
must
disturb
your
more
serene
thoughts
with
telling
you
that
her
first
surprise
and
griefs
at
the
news
of
your
departure
were
most
deplorable
where
raging
madness
and
the
softer
passion
of
love
complaints
of
grief
and
anger
sighs
tears
and
cries
were
so
mixed
together
and
by
turns
so
violently
seized
her
that
all
about
her
wept
and
pitied
her
it
was
sad
it
was
wondrous
sad
my
lord
to
see
it
nor
could
we
hope
her
life
or
that
she
would
preserve
it
if
she
could
for
by
many
ways
she
attempted
to
have
released
herself
from
pain
by
a
violent
death
and
those
that
strove
to
preserve
that
could
not
hope
she
would
ever
have
returned
to
sense
again
sometimes
a
wild
extravagant
raving
would
require
all
our
aid
and
then
again
she
would
talk
and
rail
so
tenderly
and
express
her
resentment
in
the
kindest
softest
words
that
ever
madness
uttered
and
all
of
her
till
she
has
set
us
all
a
weeping
round
her
sometimes
she
d
sit
as
calm
and
still
as
death
and
we
have
perceived
she
lived
only
by
sighs
and
silent
tears
that
fell
into
her
bosom
then
on
a
sudden
wildly
gaze
upon
us
with
eyes
that
even
then
had
wondrous
charms
and
frantically
survey
us
all
then
cry
aloud
where
is
my
lord
oh
bring
me
my
oh
where
have
you
hid
the
treasure
of
my
soul
then
weeping
floods
of
tears
would
sink
all
fainting
in
our
arms
anon
with
trembling
words
and
sighs
she
d
cry
but
oh
my
dear
is
no
more
you
have
surrendered
him
to
yes
yes
you
have
given
him
up
and
he
must
die
publicly
die
be
led
a
sad
victim
through
the
joyful
crowd
reproached
and
fall
ingloriously
then
rave
again
and
tear
her
lovely
hair
and
act
such
wildness
so
moving
and
so
sad
as
even
infected
the
pitying
beholders
and
all
we
could
do
was
gently
to
persuade
her
grief
and
soothe
her
raving
fits
but
so
we
swore
so
heartily
we
vowed
that
you
were
safe
that
with
the
aid
of
who
came
that
day
to
visit
her
we
made
her
capable
of
hearing
a
little
reason
from
us
kneeled
and
begged
she
would
but
calmly
hear
him
speak
he
pawned
his
soul
his
honour
and
his
life
was
as
safe
from
any
injury
either
from
or
any
other
enemy
as
he
as
she
or
heaven
itself
in
fine
my
lord
he
vowed
he
swore
and
pleaded
till
she
with
patience
heard
him
tell
his
story
and
the
necessity
of
your
absence
this
brought
her
temper
back
and
dried
her
eyes
then
sighing
answered
him
that
if
for
your
safety
you
were
fled
she
would
forgive
your
cruelty
and
your
absence
and
endeavour
to
be
herself
again
but
then
she
would
a
thousand
times
conjure
him
not
to
deceive
her
faith
by
all
the
friendship
that
he
bore
not
to
possess
her
with
false
hopes
then
would
he
swear
anew
and
as
he
swore
she
would
behold
him
with
such
charming
sadness
in
her
eyes
that
he
almost
forgot
what
he
would
say
to
gaze
upon
her
and
to
pass
his
pity
but
if
with
all
his
power
of
beauty
and
of
rhetoric
he
left
her
calm
he
was
no
sooner
gone
but
she
returned
to
all
the
tempests
of
despairing
love
to
all
the
unbelief
of
faithless
passion
would
neither
sleep
nor
eat
nor
suffer
day
to
enter
but
all
was
sad
and
gloomy
as
the
vault
that
held
the
matron
nor
suffered
she
any
to
approach
her
but
her
page
and
count
and
he
in
the
midst
of
all
was
well
received
not
that
i
think
my
lord
she
feigned
any
part
of
that
close
retirement
to
entertain
him
with
any
freedom
that
did
not
become
a
woman
of
perfect
love
and
honour
though
i
must
own
my
lord
i
believe
it
impossible
for
him
to
behold
the
lovely
without
having
a
passion
for
her
what
restraint
his
friendship
to
you
may
put
upon
his
heart
or
tongue
i
know
not
but
i
conclude
him
a
lover
though
without
success
what
effects
that
may
have
upon
the
heart
of
only
time
can
render
an
account
of
and
whose
conduct
i
shall
the
more
particularly
observe
from
a
curiosity
natural
to
me
to
see
if
it
may
be
possible
for
to
love
again
after
the
adorable
which
levity
in
one
so
perfect
would
cure
me
of
the
disease
of
love
while
i
lived
amongst
the
fickle
sex
but
since
no
such
thought
can
yet
get
possession
of
my
belief
i
humbly
beg
your
lordship
will
entertain
no
jealousy
that
may
be
so
fatal
to
your
repose
and
to
that
of
doubt
not
but
my
fears
proceed
perfectly
from
the
zeal
i
have
for
your
lordship
for
whose
honour
and
tranquillity
none
shall
venture
so
far
as
my
lord
your
lordship
s
most
humble
and
obedient
servant
brilliard
postscript
lord
the
groom
shall
set
forward
with
your
coach
horses
tomorrow
morning
according
to
your
having
writ
this
he
read
it
over
not
to
see
whether
it
were
witty
or
eloquent
or
writ
up
to
the
sense
of
so
good
a
judge
as
but
to
see
whether
he
had
cast
it
for
his
purpose
for
there
his
masterpiece
was
to
be
shewn
and
having
read
it
he
doubted
whether
the
relation
of
griefs
were
not
too
moving
and
whether
they
might
not
serve
to
revive
his
fading
love
which
were
intended
only
as
a
demonstration
of
his
own
pity
and
compassion
that
from
thence
the
deceived
lover
might
with
the
more
ease
entertain
a
belief
in
what
he
hinted
of
her
levity
when
he
was
to
make
that
out
as
he
now
had
but
touched
upon
it
for
he
would
not
have
it
thought
the
business
of
malice
to
but
duty
and
respect
to
that
thought
reconciled
him
to
the
first
part
without
alteration
and
he
fancied
he
had
said
enough
in
the
latter
to
give
any
man
of
love
and
sense
a
jealousy
which
might
inspire
a
young
lover
in
pursuit
of
a
new
mistress
with
a
revenge
that
might
wholly
turn
to
his
advantage
for
now
every
ray
gave
him
light
enough
to
conduct
him
to
hope
and
he
believed
nothing
too
difficult
for
his
love
nor
what
his
invention
could
not
conquer
he
fancied
himself
a
very
already
and
almost
promised
himself
the
charming
with
these
thoughts
he
seals
up
his
letters
and
hastes
to
chamber
for
her
farther
commands
having
in
his
politic
transports
forgotten
he
had
left
with
her
who
no
sooner
had
seen
quit
the
chamber
all
trembling
and
disordered
after
having
given
him
entrance
but
the
next
step
was
to
the
feet
of
the
new
recovered
languishing
beauty
who
not
knowing
any
thing
of
the
freedom
the
daring
husband
lover
had
taken
was
not
at
all
surprised
to
hear
cry
kneeling
before
her
ah
madam
i
no
longer
wonder
you
use
with
such
rigour
then
sighing
declined
his
melancholy
eyes
where
love
and
jealousy
made
themselves
too
apparent
while
she
believing
he
had
only
reproached
her
want
of
ceremony
at
his
entrance
checking
herself
she
started
from
the
bed
and
taking
him
by
the
hand
to
raise
him
she
cried
rise
my
lord
and
pardon
the
omission
of
that
respect
which
was
not
wanting
but
with
even
life
answered
yes
madam
but
you
took
care
not
to
make
the
world
absolutely
unhappy
in
your
eternal
loss
and
therefore
made
choice
of
such
a
time
to
die
in
when
you
were
sure
of
a
skilful
person
at
hand
to
bring
you
back
to
life
my
lord
said
she
with
an
innocent
wonder
in
her
eyes
and
an
ignorance
that
did
not
apprehend
him
i
mean
said
he
whom
i
found
sufficiently
disordered
to
make
me
believe
he
took
no
little
pains
to
restore
you
to
the
world
this
he
spoke
with
such
an
air
as
easily
made
her
imagine
he
was
a
lover
to
the
degree
of
jealousy
and
therefore
beholding
him
with
a
look
that
told
him
her
disdain
before
she
spoke
she
replied
hastily
my
lord
if
have
expressed
by
any
disorder
or
concern
his
kind
sense
of
my
sufferings
i
am
more
obliged
to
him
for
it
than
i
am
to
you
for
your
opinion
of
my
virtue
and
i
shall
hereafter
know
how
to
set
a
value
both
on
the
one
and
the
other
since
what
he
wants
in
quality
and
ability
to
serve
me
he
sufficiently
makes
good
with
his
respect
and
at
that
she
would
have
quitted
him
but
he
still
kneeling
held
her
train
of
her
gown
and
besought
her
with
all
the
eloquence
of
moving
and
petitioning
love
that
she
would
pardon
the
effect
of
a
passion
that
could
not
run
into
less
extravagancy
at
a
sight
so
new
and
strange
as
that
she
should
in
a
morning
with
only
her
thrown
loosely
about
her
lovely
body
and
which
left
a
thousand
charms
to
view
alone
receive
a
man
into
her
chamber
and
make
fast
the
door
upon
them
which
when
from
his
importunity
it
was
opened
he
found
her
all
ruffled
and
almost
fainting
on
her
bed
and
a
young
blushing
youth
start
from
her
arms
with
trembling
limbs
and
a
heart
that
beat
time
to
the
tune
of
active
love
faltering
in
his
speech
as
if
scarce
yet
he
had
recruited
the
sense
he
had
so
happily
lost
in
the
amorous
encounter
with
that
surveying
of
herself
as
she
stood
in
a
great
glass
which
she
could
not
hinder
herself
from
doing
she
found
indeed
her
her
gown
and
the
bosom
of
her
shift
in
such
disorder
as
if
at
least
she
had
yet
any
doubt
remaining
that
had
not
treated
her
well
she
however
found
cause
enough
to
excuse
opinion
weighing
all
the
circumstances
together
and
adjusting
her
linen
and
gown
with
blushes
that
almost
appeared
criminal
she
turned
to
who
still
held
her
and
still
begged
her
pardon
assuring
him
upon
her
honour
her
love
to
and
her
friendship
for
him
that
she
was
perfectly
innocent
and
that
though
he
should
have
quality
and
all
other
advantages
which
he
wanted
to
render
him
acceptable
yet
there
was
in
nature
something
which
compelled
her
to
a
sort
of
coldness
and
disgust
to
his
person
for
she
had
so
much
the
more
abhorrence
to
him
as
he
was
a
husband
but
that
was
a
secret
to
but
she
continued
speaking
and
cried
no
could
i
be
brought
to
yield
to
any
but
i
own
i
find
charms
enough
in
to
make
a
conquest
but
since
the
possession
of
that
dear
man
is
all
i
ask
of
heaven
i
charge
my
soul
with
a
crime
when
i
but
hear
love
from
any
other
therefore
i
conjure
you
if
you
have
any
satisfaction
in
my
conversation
never
to
speak
of
love
more
to
me
for
if
you
do
honour
will
oblige
me
to
make
vows
against
seeing
you
all
the
freedoms
of
friendship
i
will
allow
give
you
the
liberties
of
a
brother
admit
you
alone
by
night
or
any
way
but
that
of
love
but
that
is
a
reserve
of
my
soul
which
is
only
for
and
the
only
one
that
ever
shall
be
kept
from
she
ended
speaking
and
raised
him
with
a
smile
and
he
with
a
sigh
told
her
she
must
command
then
she
fell
to
telling
him
how
she
had
sent
for
and
all
the
discourse
that
passed
with
the
reason
of
her
falling
into
a
swoon
in
which
she
continued
a
moment
or
two
and
while
she
told
it
she
blushed
with
a
secret
fear
that
in
that
trance
some
freedoms
might
be
taken
which
she
durst
not
confess
but
while
she
spoke
our
still
more
passionate
lover
devoured
her
with
his
eyes
fixed
his
very
soul
upon
her
charms
of
speaking
and
looking
and
was
a
thousand
times
urged
by
transporting
passion
ready
to
break
all
her
dictates
and
vow
himself
her
eternal
slave
but
he
feared
the
result
and
therefore
kept
himself
within
the
bounds
of
seeming
friendship
so
that
after
a
thousand
things
she
said
of
he
took
his
leave
to
go
to
dinner
but
as
he
was
going
out
he
saw
enter
who
as
i
said
had
forgot
he
left
with
her
but
in
a
moment
recollecting
himself
he
blushed
at
the
apprehension
that
they
might
make
his
disorder
the
subject
of
their
discourse
so
what
with
that
and
the
sight
of
the
dear
object
of
his
late
disappointed
pleasures
he
had
much
ado
to
assume
an
assurance
to
approach
but
passed
out
and
gave
him
a
little
release
confusion
was
almost
equal
to
his
for
she
looked
on
him
as
a
ravisher
but
how
to
find
that
truth
which
she
was
very
curious
to
know
she
called
up
all
the
arts
of
women
to
instruct
her
in
by
threats
she
knew
it
was
in
vain
therefore
she
assumed
an
artifice
which
indeed
was
almost
a
stranger
to
her
heart
that
of
jilting
him
out
of
a
secret
which
she
knew
he
wanted
generosity
to
give
handsomely
and
meeting
him
with
a
smile
which
she
forced
she
cried
how
now
are
you
so
a
soldier
you
can
not
see
a
lady
die
without
being
terrified
rather
madam
replied
he
blushing
anew
so
i
can
not
see
the
loveliest
person
in
the
world
fainting
in
my
arms
without
being
disordered
with
grief
and
fear
beyond
the
power
of
many
days
to
resettle
at
which
she
approached
him
who
stood
near
the
door
and
shutting
it
she
took
him
by
the
hand
and
smiling
cried
and
had
you
no
other
business
for
your
heart
but
grief
and
fear
when
a
fair
lady
throws
herself
into
your
arms
it
ought
to
have
had
some
kinder
effect
on
a
person
of
youth
and
and
while
she
spoke
this
she
held
him
by
the
wrist
and
found
on
the
sudden
his
pulse
to
beat
more
high
and
his
heart
to
heave
his
bosom
with
sighs
which
now
he
no
longer
took
care
to
hide
but
with
a
transported
joy
he
cried
oh
madam
do
not
urge
me
to
a
confession
that
must
undo
me
without
making
it
criminal
by
my
discovery
of
it
you
know
i
am
your
slave
when
she
with
a
pretty
wondering
smile
cried
what
a
lover
too
and
yet
so
dull
oh
charming
says
he
and
falling
on
his
knees
give
my
profound
respect
a
kinder
name
to
which
she
answered
you
that
know
your
sentiments
may
best
instruct
me
by
what
name
to
call
them
and
you
may
do
it
without
fear
you
saw
i
did
not
struggle
in
your
arms
nor
strove
i
to
defend
the
kisses
which
you
gave
oh
heavens
cried
he
transported
with
what
she
said
is
it
possible
that
you
could
know
of
my
presumption
and
favour
it
too
i
will
no
longer
then
curse
those
unlucky
stars
that
sent
just
in
the
blessed
minute
to
snatch
me
from
my
heaven
the
lovely
victim
lay
ready
for
the
sacrifice
all
prepared
to
offer
my
hands
my
eyes
my
lips
were
tired
with
pleasure
but
yet
they
were
not
satisfied
oh
there
was
joy
beyond
those
ravishments
of
which
one
kind
minute
more
had
made
me
absolute
lord
yes
and
the
next
said
she
had
sent
this
to
your
heart
snatching
a
penknife
that
lay
on
her
toilet
where
she
had
been
writing
which
she
offered
so
near
to
his
bosom
that
he
believed
himself
already
pierced
so
sensibly
killing
her
words
her
motion
and
her
look
he
started
from
her
and
she
threw
away
the
knife
and
walked
a
turn
or
two
about
the
chamber
while
he
stood
immovable
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
earth
and
his
thoughts
on
nothing
but
a
wild
confusion
which
he
vowed
afterwards
he
could
give
no
account
of
but
as
she
turned
she
beheld
him
with
some
compassion
and
remembering
how
he
had
it
in
his
power
to
expose
her
in
a
strange
country
and
own
her
for
a
wife
she
believed
it
necessary
to
hide
her
resentments
and
cried
for
the
friendship
your
lord
has
for
you
i
forgive
you
but
have
a
care
you
never
raise
your
thoughts
to
a
presumption
of
that
nature
more
do
not
hope
i
will
ever
fall
below
love
go
and
repent
your
crime
and
expect
all
things
else
from
my
favour
at
this
he
left
her
with
a
bow
that
had
some
malice
in
it
and
she
returned
into
her
after
dinner
writes
her
this
letter
which
his
page
brought
octavio
sylvia
true
that
in
obedience
to
your
commands
i
begged
your
pardon
for
the
confession
i
made
you
of
my
passion
but
since
you
could
not
but
see
the
contradiction
of
my
tongue
in
my
eyes
and
hear
it
but
too
well
confirmed
by
my
sighs
why
will
you
confine
me
to
the
formalities
of
a
silent
languishment
unless
to
increase
my
flame
with
my
pain
you
conjure
me
to
see
you
often
and
at
the
same
time
forbid
me
speaking
my
passion
and
this
bold
intruder
comes
to
tell
you
now
it
is
impossible
to
obey
the
first
without
disobliging
the
last
and
since
the
crime
of
adoring
you
exceeds
my
disobedience
in
not
waiting
on
you
be
pleased
at
least
to
pardon
that
fault
which
my
profound
respect
to
the
lovely
makes
me
commit
for
it
is
impossible
to
see
you
and
not
give
you
an
occasion
of
reproaching
me
if
i
could
make
a
truce
with
my
eyes
and
like
a
mortified
capuchin
look
always
downwards
not
daring
to
behold
the
glorious
temptations
of
your
beauty
yet
you
wound
a
thousand
ways
besides
your
touches
inflame
me
and
your
voice
has
music
in
it
that
strikes
upon
my
soul
with
ravishing
tenderness
your
wit
is
unresistible
and
piercing
your
very
sorrows
and
complaints
have
charms
that
make
me
soft
without
the
aid
of
love
but
pity
joined
with
passion
raises
a
flame
too
mighty
for
my
conduct
and
i
in
transports
every
way
confess
it
yes
yes
upbraid
me
call
me
traitor
and
ungrateful
tell
me
my
friendship
is
false
but
yet
be
just
and
say
my
love
was
true
say
only
he
had
seen
the
charming
and
who
is
he
that
after
that
would
not
excuse
the
rest
in
one
so
absolutely
born
to
be
undone
by
love
as
is
her
destined
slave
octavio
postscript
among
some
rarities
i
this
morning
saw
i
found
these
florio
you
which
because
uncommon
i
presume
to
send
notwithstanding
the
seeming
severity
of
her
commands
was
well
enough
pleased
to
be
disobeyed
and
women
never
pardon
any
fault
more
willingly
than
one
of
this
nature
where
the
crime
gives
so
infallible
a
demonstration
of
their
power
and
beauty
nor
can
any
of
their
sex
be
angry
in
their
hearts
for
being
thought
desirable
and
it
was
not
with
pain
that
she
saw
him
obstinate
in
his
passion
as
you
may
believe
by
her
answering
his
letters
nor
ought
any
lover
to
despair
when
he
receives
denial
under
his
mistress
s
own
hand
which
she
sent
in
this
to
sylvia
octavio
you
but
ill
judge
of
my
wit
or
humour
when
you
send
me
such
a
present
and
such
a
billet
if
you
believe
i
either
receive
the
one
or
the
other
as
you
designed
in
obedience
to
me
you
will
no
more
tell
me
of
your
love
and
yet
at
the
same
time
you
are
breaking
your
word
from
one
end
of
the
paper
to
the
other
out
of
respect
to
me
you
will
see
me
no
more
and
yet
are
bribing
me
with
presents
believing
you
have
found
out
the
surest
way
to
a
woman
s
heart
i
must
needs
confess
there
is
great
eloquence
in
a
pair
of
bracelets
of
five
thousand
crowns
it
is
an
argument
to
prove
your
passion
that
has
more
prevailing
reason
in
it
than
either
or
could
have
urged
nor
can
a
lover
write
or
speak
in
any
language
so
significant
and
very
well
to
be
understood
as
in
that
silent
one
of
presenting
the
malicious
world
has
a
long
time
agreed
to
reproach
poor
women
with
cruel
unkind
insensible
and
dull
when
indeed
it
is
those
men
that
are
in
fault
who
want
the
right
way
of
addressing
the
true
and
secret
arts
of
moving
that
sovereign
remedy
against
disdain
it
is
you
alone
my
lord
like
a
young
that
have
found
the
direct
unpractised
way
to
that
little
and
so
much
desired
world
the
favour
of
the
fair
nor
could
love
himself
have
pointed
his
arrows
with
any
thing
more
successful
for
his
conquest
of
hearts
but
mine
my
lord
like
shield
is
already
so
full
of
arrows
shot
from
eyes
it
has
no
room
for
any
other
darts
take
back
your
presents
then
my
lord
and
when
you
make
them
next
be
sure
you
first
consider
the
receiver
for
know
maids
of
my
quality
ought
to
find
themselves
secure
from
addresses
of
this
nature
unless
they
first
invite
you
ought
to
have
seen
advances
in
my
freedoms
consenting
in
my
eyes
or
that
usual
vanity
of
my
sex
a
thousand
little
trifling
arts
of
affectation
to
furnish
out
a
conquest
a
forward
complaisance
to
every
gaudy
coxcomb
to
fill
my
train
with
amorous
cringing
captives
this
might
have
justified
your
pretensions
but
on
the
contrary
my
eyes
and
thoughts
which
never
strayed
from
the
dear
man
i
love
were
always
bent
to
earth
when
gazed
upon
by
you
and
when
i
did
but
fear
you
looked
with
love
i
entertained
you
with
praise
his
wondrous
beauty
and
his
wondrous
love
and
left
nothing
untold
that
might
confirm
you
how
much
impossible
it
was
i
ever
should
love
again
that
i
might
leave
you
no
room
for
hope
and
since
my
story
has
been
so
unfortunate
to
alarm
the
whole
world
with
a
conduct
so
fatal
i
made
no
scruple
of
telling
you
with
what
joy
and
pride
i
was
undone
if
this
encourage
you
if
have
sentiments
so
meanly
poor
of
me
to
think
because
i
yielded
to
his
hopes
should
be
advanced
i
banish
him
for
ever
from
my
sight
and
after
that

this

she
sent
him
back
by
his
page
but
not
the
bracelets
which
were
indeed
very
fine
and
very
considerable
at
the

time
she
threatened
him
with
banishment
she
so
absolutely
expected
to
be
disobeyed
in
all
things
of
that
kind
that
she
dressed
herself
that
day
to
advantage
which
since
her
arrival
she
had
never
done
in
her
own
habits
what
with
her
illness
and
absence
a
careless
negligence
had
seized
her
till
roused
and
weakened
to
the
thoughts
of
beauty
by
love
she
began
to
try
its
force
and
that
day
dressed
while
she
was
so
employed
the
page
hastes
with
the
letter
to
his
lord
who
changed
colour
at
the
sight
of
it
ere
he
received
it
not
that
he
hoped
it
brought
love
it
was
enough
she
would
but
answer
though
she
railed
let
her
said
he
opening
it
she
hates
me
let
her
call
me
traitor
and
unjust
so
she
take
the
pains
to
tell
it
this
way
for
he
knew
well
those
that
argue
will
yield
and
only
she
that
sends
him
back
his
own
letters
without
reading
them
can
give
despair
he
read
therefore
without
a
sigh
nor
complained
he
on
her
rigours
and
because
it
was
too
early
yet
to
make
his
visit
to
shew
the
impatience
of
his
love
as
much
as
the
reality
and
resolution
of
it
he
bid
his

wait

sent
her
back

answer

how
has
my

offended
has
its
excess
betrayed
the
least
part
of
that
respect

your
birth
and
beauty
though
i
am
young
as
the
gay
ruddy
morning
and
vigorous
as
the
gilded
sun
at
noon
and
amorous
as
that
god
when
with
such
haste
he
chased
young
over
the
flowery
plain
it
never
made
me
guilty
of
a
thought
that
might
not

and
allow
nor
came
that
trifling
present
to
plead
for
any
wish
or
mend
my
eloquence
which
you
with
such
disdain
upbraid
me
with
the
bracelets
came
not
to
be
raffled
for
your

nor

to
my
desires

has
a

way
of

and
you
have
taught
me
too
well
to
judge
of
and
to
value
beauty
to
dare
to
bid
so
cheaply
for
it
i
found
the
toy
was

the
work
was
neat

new

not

would
so
well
adorn

if
after
this
i
should
have
been
the
mercenary
fool
to
have
dunned
you
for

you
might
have
used
me
thus
condemn
me
ere
you
find
me
sin
in

that
part
of
it
was

so
far
behind

was
scarce
arrived
in
wish
you
should
have
stayed
till
it
approached
more
near
before
you
damned
it
to
eternal
silence
to
love
to
sigh
to
weep
to
pray
and
to
complain
why
one
may
be
allowed
it
in
devotion

you
nicer
than

itself
make
that
a
crime
which
all
the

have
never

will
not

is

will
claim
my

as
well
as
your
the
echoes
answer
me
as
willingly

i
complain
or
name
the
cruel
fountains
receive
my
tears
and
the
kind
spring
s
reflection
agreeably
flatters
me
to
hope
and
makes
me
vain
enough
to
think
it
just
and
reasonable
i
should
pursue
the
dictates
of
my
soul
love
on
in
spite
of
opposition
because
i
will
not
lose
my
privileges
you
may
forbid
me
naming
it
to
you
in
that
i
can
obey
because
i
can
but
not
to
love
not
to
adore
the
fair
and
not
to
languish
for
you
were
as
impossible
as
for
you
not
to
be
lovely
not
to
be
the
most
charming
of
your
sex
but
i
am
so
far
from
a
pretending
fool
because
you
have
been
possessed
that
often
that
thought
comes
cross
my
soul
and
checks
my
advancing
love
and
i
would
buy
that
thought
off
with
almost
all
my
share
of
future
bliss
were
i
a

the

should
be

you
a

again
for

whatever
reasons
flattering
love
can
bring
to
make
it
look
like
just
the
world
the
world
fair
still
will
censure
and
say
you
were
to
blame
but
it
was
that
fault
alone
that
made
you
mortal
we
else
should
have
adored
you
as
a
deity
and
so
have
lost
a
generous
race
of
young
succeeding
heroes

may
be
born
of

had
loved

half
so
well
as

your
glorious
fame
entire

alone

let
her
be
false
to
honour
false
to

wanton
and
proud
vain
fantastic
or
what
is
worse
let
her
pursue
her
love
be
constant
and
still
dote

still
she
will
be

octavio
this
he
sent
by
his
page
at
the
same
time
that
she
expected
the
visit
of
his
lord
and
blushed
with
a
little
anger
and
concern
at
the
disappointment
however
she
hasted
to
read
the
letter
and
was
pleased
with
the
haughty
resolution
he
made
in
spite
of
her
to
love
on
as
his
right
by
birth
and
she
was
glad
to
find
from
these
positive
resolves
that
she
might
the
more
safely
disdain
or
at
least
assume
a
tyranny
which
might
render
her
virtue
glorious
and
yet
at
the
same
time
keep
him
her
slave
on
all
occasions
when
she
might
have
need
of
his
service
which
in
the
circumstances
she
was
in
she
did
not
know
of
what
great
use
it
might
be
to
her
she
having
no
other
design
on
him
bating
the
little
vanity
of
her
sex
which
is
an
ingredient
so
intermixed
with
the
greatest
virtues
of
that
those
who
endeavour
to
cure
them
of
that
disease
rob
them
of
a
very
considerable
pleasure
and
in
most
it
is
incurable
give
then
leave
to
share
it
with
her
sex
since
she
was
so
much
the
more
excusable
by
how
much
a
greater
portion
of
beauty
she
had
than
any
other
and
had
sense
enough
to
know
it
too
as
indeed
whatever
other
knowledge
they
want
they
have
still
enough
to
set
a
price
on
beauty
though
they
do
not
always
rate
it
for
had
done
that
she
had
been
the
happiest
of
her
sex
but
as
she
was
she
waited
the
coming
of
but
not
so
as
to
make
her
quit
one
sad
thought
for
love
and
vanity
though
they
both
reigned
in
her
soul
yet
the
first
surmounted
the
last
and
she
grew
to
impatient
ravings
whenever
she
cast
a
thought
upon
her
fear
that
grew
cold
and
possibly
pride
and
vanity
had
as
great
a
share
in
that
concern
of
hers
as
love
itself
for
she
would
oft
survey
herself
in
her
glass
and
cry
gods
can
this
beauty
be
despised
this
shape
this
face
this
youth
this
air
and
what
s
more
obliging
yet
a
heart
that
adores
the
fugitive
that
languishes
and
sighs
after
the
dear
runaway
is
it
possible
he
can
find
a
beauty
added
she
of
greater
perfection
but
oh
it
is
fancy
sets
the
rate
on
beauty

he
may
as
well
love
a
third

as
he
has
a
second

that
once
break
the
rules
and
laws
of
that
deity

no
bounds
to
their
treasons
and
disobedience
yes
yes
would
she
cry

that
could
leave
the
fair
the
young
the
noble
chaste
and
fond

after
that
may
he
not
do
to
on
whom
he
has

less
obligations
oh
wretched
maid
what
has
thy
fondness
done
he
is
satiated
now
with
thee
as
before
with
and
carries
all
those
dear
those
charming
joys
to
some
new
beauty
whom
his
looks
have
conquered
and
whom
his
soft
bewitching
vows
will
with
that
she
raved
and
stamped
and
cried
aloud
hell
fires
tortures
daggers
racks
and
poison
come
all
to
my
relief
revenge
me
on
the
perjured
lovely
devil
but
i
will
be
brave
i
will
be
brave
and
hate
him
this
she
spoke
in
a
tone
less
fierce
and
with
great
pride
and
had
not
paused
and
walked
above
a
hasty
turn
or
two
but
as
impatient
as
love
could
make
him
entered
the
chamber
so
dressed
so
set
out
for
conquest
that
i
wonder
at
nothing
more
than
that
did
not
find
him
altogether
charming
and
fit
for
her
revenge
who
was
formed
by
nature
for
love
and
had
all
that
could
render
him
the
dotage
of
women
but
where
a
heart
is
prepossessed
all
that
is
beautiful
in
any
other
man
serves
but
as
an
ill
comparison
to
what
it
loves
and
even
likeness
that
was
not
indeed
wanted
the
secret
to
charm
at
entrance
she
was
so
fixed
on
her
revenge
of
love
that
she
did
not
see
him
who
presented
himself
as
so
proper
an
instrument
till
he
first
sighing
spoke
ah
shall
i
never
see
that
beauty
easy
more
shall
i
never
see
it
reconciled
to
content
and
a
soft
calmness
fixed
upon
those
eyes
which
were
formed
for
looks
all
tender
and
serene
or
are
they
resolved
continued
he
sighing
never
to
appear
but
in
storms
when
i
approach
yes
replied
she
when
there
is
a
calm
of
love
in
yours
that
raises
will
you
confine
my
eyes
said
he
that
are
by
nature
soft
may
not
their
silent
language
tell
you
my
heart
s
sad
story
but
she
replied
with
a
sigh
it
is
not
generously
done
thus
to
pursue
a
poor
unguarded
maid
left
to
your
care
your
promises
of
friendship
ah
will
you
use
with
such
treachery
sylvia
said
he
flame
is
so
just
and
reasonable
that
i
dare
even
to
him
pronounce
i
love
you
and
after
that
dare
love
you
on
and
would
you
said
she
to
satisfy
a
little
short
lived
passion
forfeit
those
vows
you
have
made
of
friendship
to
that
heart
that
loves
you
sylvia
he
replied
can
not
be
guilty
of
so
base
a
thought
is
my
friend
and
as
he
is
so
shall
know
the
dearest
secrets
of
my
soul
i
should
believe
myself
indeed
ungrateful
continued
he
wherever
i
loved
should
i
not
tell
he
told
me
frankly
all
his
soul
his
loves
his
griefs
his
treasons
and
escapes
and
in
return
i
will
pay
him
back
with
and
do
you
imagine
said
she
that
he
would
permit
your
love
how
should
he
hinder
me
replied
he
i
do
believe
said
she
he
d
forget
all
his
safety
and
his
friendship
and
fight
i
d
defend
myself
said
he
if
he
were
so
while
they
thus
argued
had
her
thoughts
apart
on
the
little
stratagems
that
women
in
love
sometimes
make
use
of
and
no
sooner
told
her
he
would
send
word
of
his
love
but
she
imagined
that
such
a
knowledge
might
retrieve
the
heart
of
her
lover
if
indeed
it
were
on
the
wing
and
revive
the
dying
embers
in
his
soul
as
usually
it
does
from
such
occasions
and
on
the
other
side
she
thought
that
she
might
more
allowably
receive
addresses
when
they
were
with
the
permission
of
if
he
could
love
so
well
to
permit
it
and
if
he
could
not
she
should
have
the
joy
to
undeceive
her
fears
of
his
inconstancy
though
she
banished
for
ever
the
agreeable
so
that
on
farther
urging
the
necessity
of
his
giving
that
sure
mark
of
his
friendship
she
permitted
him
to
write
which
he
immediately
did
on
her
table
where
there
stood
a
little
silver
escritoire
which
contained
all
things
for
this
purpose
octavio
philander
since
i
have
vowed
you
my
eternal
friendship
and
that
i
absolutely
believe
myself
honoured
with
that
of
yours
i
think
myself
obliged
by
those
powerful
ties
to
let
you
know
my
heart
not
only
now
as
that
friend
from
whom
i
ought
to
conceal
nothing
but
as
a
rival
too
whom
in
honour
i
ought
to
treat
as
a
generous
one
perhaps
you
will
be
so
unkind
as
to
say
i
can
not
be
a
friend
and
a
rival
at
the
same
time
and
that
almighty
love
that
sets
the
world
at
odds
chases
all
things
from
the
heart
where
that
reigns
to
establish
itself
the
more
absolutely
there
but
my
lord
i
avow
mine
a
love
of
that
good
nature
that
can
endure
the
equal
sway
of
friendship
where
like
two
perfect
friends
they
support
each
other
s
empire
there
nor
can
the
glory
of
one
eclipse
that
of
the
other
but
both
like
the
notion
we
have
of
the
deity
though
two
distinct
passions
make
but
one
in
my
soul
and
though
friendship
first
entered
twas
in
vain
i
called
it
to
my
aid
at
the
first
soft
invasion
of
power
and
you
my
charming
friend
are
the
most
oblig
d
to
pity
me
who
already
know
so
well
the
force
of
her
beauty
i
would
fain
have
you
think
i
strove
at
first
with
all
my
reason
against
the
irresistible
lustre
of
her
eyes
and
at
the
first
assaults
of
love
i
gave
him
not
a
welcome
to
my
bosom
but
like
slaves
unused
to
fetters
i
grew
sullen
with
my
chains
and
wore
them
for
your
sake
uneasily
i
thought
it
base
to
look
upon
the
mistress
of
my
friend
with
wishing
eyes
but
softer
love
soon
furnished
me
with
arguments
to
justify
my
claim
since
love
is
not
the
choice
but
the
face
of
the
soul
who
seldom
regards
the
object
lov
d
as
it
is
but
as
it
wishes
to
have
it
be
and
then
kind
fancy
makes
it
soon
the
same
love
that
almighty
creator
of
something
from
nothing
forms
a
wit
a
hero
or
a
beauty
virtue
good
humour
honour
any
excellence
when
oftentimes
there
is
neither
in
the
object
but
where
the
agreeing
world
has
fixed
all
these
and
since
it
is
by
all
resolved
whether
they
love
or
not
that
this
is
she
you
ought
no
more
to
upbraid
my
flame
than
to
wonder
at
it
it
is
enough
i
tell
you
that
it
is
to
justify
my
passion
nor
is
it
a
crime
that
i
confess
i
love
since
it
can
never
rob
of
the
least
part
of
what
i
have
vowed
him
or
if
his
mere
honour
will
believe
me
guilty
of
a
fault
let
this
atone
for
all
that
if
i
wrong
my
friend
in
loving
i
right
him
in
despairing
for
oh
i
am
repulsed
with
all
the
rigour
of
the
coy
and
fair
with
all
the
little
malice
of
the
witty
sex
and
all
the
love
of
to
there
there
is
the
stop
to
all
my
hopes
and
happiness
and
yet
by
heaven
i
love
thee
oh
thou
favoured
rival
after
this
frank
confession
my
i
should
be
glad
to
hear
your
sentiment
since
yet
in
spite
of
love
in
spite
of
beauty
i
am
resolved
to
die
constant
friend
octavio
after
he
had
writ
this
he
gave
it
to
see
charming
creature
said
he
in
delivering
it
if
after
this
you
either
doubt
my
love
or
what
i
dare
for
i
neither
receive
it
said
she
as
a
proof
of
the
one
or
the
other
but
rather
that
you
believe
by
this
frank
confession
to
render
it
as
a
piece
of
gallantry
and
diversion
to
for
no
man
of
sense
will
imagine
that
love
true
or
arrived
to
any
height
that
makes
a
public
confession
of
it
to
his
ah
answered
he
how
malicious
is
your
wit
and
how
active
to
turn
its
pointed
mischief
on
me
had
i
not
writ
you
would
have
said
i
durst
not
and
when
i
make
a
declaration
of
it
you
call
it
only
a
slight
piece
of
gallantry
but
you
have
wit
enough
to
try
it
a
thousand
ways
and
power
enough
to
make
me
obey
use
the
extremity
of
both
so
you
recompense
me
at
last
with
a
confession
that
i
was
at
least
found
worthy
to
be
numbered
in
the
crowd
of
your
replied
he
were
a
dull
lover
indeed
that
would
need
instructions
from
the
wit
of
his
mistress
to
give
her
proofs
of
his
passion
whatever
opinion
you
have
of
my
sense
i
have
too
good
a
one
of
to
believe
that
when
he
is
a
lover
he
will
want
aids
to
make
it
appear
till
then
we
will
let
that
argument
alone
and
consider
his
address
to
she
then
read
over
the
letter
he
had
writ
which
she
liked
very
well
for
her
purpose
for
at
this
time
our
young
was
made
a
property
of
in
order
to
her
revenge
on
she
told
him
he
had
said
too
much
both
for
himself
and
her
he
told
her
he
had
declared
nothing
with
his
pen
that
he
would
not
make
good
with
his
sword
sir
said
she
and
do
not
imagine
from
the
freedom
you
have
taken
in
owning
your
passion
to
that
i
shall
allow
it
here
what
you
declare
to
the
world
is
your
own
crime
but
when
i
hear
it
it
is
no
longer
yours
but
mine
i
therefore
conjure
you
my
lord
not
to
charge
my
soul
with
so
great
a
sin
against
and
i
confess
to
you
i
shall
be
infinitely
troubled
to
be
obliged
to
banish
you
my
sight
for
he
heard
her
and
answered
with
a
sigh
for
she
went
from
him
to
the
table
and
sealed
her
letter
and
gave
it
him
to
be
enclosed
to
and
left
him
to
consider
on
her
last
words
which
he
did
not
lay
to
heart
because
he
fancied
she
spoke
this
as
women
do
that
will
be
won
with
industry
he
in
standing
up
as
she
went
from
him
saw
himself
in
the
great
glass
and
bid
his
person
answer
his
heart
which
from
every
view
he
took
was
reinforced
with
new
hope
for
he
was
too
good
a
judge
of
beauty
not
to
find
it
in
every
part
of
his
own
amiable
person
nor
could
he
imagine
from
eyes
which
were
naturally
soft
and
languishing
and
now
the
more
so
from
her
fears
and
jealousies
that
she
meant
from
her
heart
the
rigours
she
expressed
much
he
allowed
for
his
short
time
of
courtship
much
to
her
sex
s
modesty
much
from
her
quality
and
very
much
from
her
love
and
imagined
it
must
be
only
time
and
assiduity
opportunity
and
obstinate
passion
that
were
capable
of
reducing
her
to
break
her
faith
with
he
therefore
endeavour
d
by
all
the
good
dressing
the
advantage
of
lavish
gaiety
to
render
his
person
agreeable
and
by
all
the
arts
of
gallantry
to
charm
her
with
his
conversation
and
when
he
could
handsomely
bring
in
love
he
failed
not
to
touch
upon
it
as
far
as
it
would
be
permitted
and
every
day
had
the
vanity
to
fancy
he
made
some
advances
for
indeed
every
day
more
and
more
she
found
she
might
have
use
for
so
considerable
a
person
so
that
one
may
very
well
say
never
any
passed
their
time
better
than
and
though
with
different
ends
all
he
had
now
to
fear
was
from
the
answer
letter
should
bring
for
whom
he
had
in
spite
of
love
so
entire
a
friendship
that
he
even
doubted
whether
if
could
urge
reasons
potent
enough
he
should
not
choose
to
die
and
quit
sylvia
rather
than
be
false
to
friendship
one
post
passed
and
another
and
so
eight
successive
ones
before
they
received
one
word
of
answer
to
what
they
sent
so
that
who
was
the
most
impatient
of
her
sex
and
the
most
in
love
was
raving
and
acting
all
the
extravagance
of
despair
and
even
now
became
less
pleasing
yet
he
failed
not
to
visit
her
every
day
to
send
her
rich
presents
and
to
say
all
that
a
fond
lover
or
a
faithful
friend
might
urge
for
her
relief
at
last
received
this
following
letter
philander
octavio
you
have
shewed
a
freedom
so
generous
and
so
beyond
the
usual
measures
of
a
rival
that
it
were
almost
injustice
in
me
not
to
permit
you
to
love
on
if
can
be
false
to
me
and
all
her
vows
she
is
not
worth
preserving
if
she
prefer
to
then
he
has
greater
merit
and
deserves
her
best
but
if
on
the
contrary
she
be
just
if
she
be
true
and
constant
i
can
not
fear
his
love
will
injure
me
so
either
way
has
my
leave
to
love
the
charming
alas
i
know
her
power
and
do
not
wonder
at
thy
fate
for
it
is
as
natural
for
her
to
conquer
as
tis
for
youth
to
yield
oh
she
has
fascination
in
her
eyes
a
spell
upon
her
tongue
her
wit
s
a
philtre
and
her
air
and
motion
all
snares
for
heedless
hearts
her
very
faults
have
charms
her
pride
her
peevishness
and
her
disdain
have
unresisted
power
alas
you
find
it
every
day
and
every
night
she
sweeps
the
tour
along
and
shews
the
beauty
she
enslaves
the
men
and
rivals
all
the
women
how
oft
with
pride
and
anger
i
have
seen
it
and
was
the
unconsidering
coxcomb
then
to
rave
and
rail
at
her
to
curse
her
charms
her
fair
inviting
and
perplexing
charms
and
bullied
every
gazer
by
heaven
i
could
not
spare
a
smile
a
look
and
she
has
such
a
lavish
freedom
in
her
humour
that
if
you
chance
to
love
as
i
have
done
it
will
surely
make
thee
mad
if
she
but
talked
aloud
or
put
her
little
affectation
on
to
show
the
force
of
beauty
oh
god
how
lost
in
rage
how
mad
with
jealousy
was
my
fond
breaking
heart
my
eyes
grew
fierce
and
clamorous
my
tongue
and
i
have
scarce
contained
myself
from
hurting
what
i
so
much
adored
but
then
the
subtle
charmer
had
such
arts
to
flatter
me
to
peace
again
to
clasp
her
lovely
arms
about
my
neck
to
sigh
a
thousand
dear
confirming
vows
into
my
bosom
and
kiss
and
smile
and
swear
and
take
away
my
rage
and
then
oh
my
no
human
fancy
can
present
the
joy
of
the
dear
reconciling
moment
where
little
quarrels
raised
the
rapture
higher
and
she
was
always
new
these
are
the
wondrous
pains
and
wondrous
pleasures
that
love
by
turns
inspires
till
it
grows
wise
by
time
and
repetition
and
then
the
god
assumes
a
serious
gravity
enjoyment
takes
off
the
uneasy
keenness
of
the
passion
the
little
jealous
quarrels
rise
no
more
quarrels
the
very
feathers
of
love
s
darts
that
send
them
with
more
swiftness
to
the
heart
and
when
they
cease
your
transports
lessen
too
then
we
grow
reasonable
and
consider
we
love
with
prudence
then
as
fencers
fight
with
foils
a
sullen
brush
perhaps
sometimes
or
so
but
nothing
that
can
touch
the
heart
and
when
we
are
arrived
to
love
at
that
dull
easy
rate
we
never
die
of
that
disease
then
we
have
recourse
to
all
the
little
arts
the
aids
of
flatterers
and
dear
dissimulation
that
to
the
lukewarm
lover
to
keep
up
a
good
character
of
constancy
and
a
right
understanding
thus
i
have
ran
through
both
the
degrees
of
love
which
i
have
taken
so
often
that
i
am
grown
most
learned
and
able
in
the
art
my
easy
heart
is
of
the
constitution
of
those
whom
frequent
sickness
renders
apt
to
take
relapses
from
every
little
cause
or
wind
that
blows
too
fiercely
on
them
it
renders
itself
to
the
first
effects
of
new
surprising
beauty
and
finds
such
pleasure
in
beginning
passion
such
dear
delight
of
fancying
new
enjoyment
that
all
past
loves
past
vows
and
obligations
have
power
to
bind
no
more
no
pity
no
remorse
no
threatening
danger
invades
my
amorous
course
i
scour
along
the
flow
ry
plains
of
love
view
all
the
charming
prospect
at
a
distance
which
represents
itself
all
gay
and
glorious
and
long
to
lay
me
down
to
stretch
and
bask
in
those
dear
joys
that
fancy
makes
so
ravishing
nor
am
i
one
of
those
dull
whining
slaves
whom
quality
or
my
respect
can
awe
into
a
silent
cringer
and
no
more
no
love
youth
and
oft
success
has
taught
me
boldness
and
art
desire
and
cunning
to
attack
to
search
the
feeble
side
of
female
weakness
and
there
to
play
love
s
engines
for
women
will
be
won
they
will
if
love
and
wit
find
any
opportunity
perhaps
my
friend
you
are
wondering
now
what
this
discourse
this
odd
discovery
of
my
own
inconstancy
tends
to
then
since
i
can
not
better
pay
you
back
the
secret
you
had
told
me
of
your
love
than
by
another
of
my
own
take
this
confession
from
thy
friend
i
love
languish
and
am
dying
for
a
new
beauty
to
you
you
that
have
lived
twenty
dull
tedious
years
and
never
understood
the
mystery
of
love
till
taught
you
to
adore
this
change
may
seem
a
wonder
you
that
have
lazily
run
more
than
half
your
youth
s
gay
course
of
life
away
without
the
pleasure
of
one
nobler
hour
of
mine
who
like
a
miser
hoard
your
sacred
store
or
scantily
have
dealt
it
but
to
one
think
me
a
lavish
prodigal
in
love
and
gravely
will
reproach
me
with
inconstancy
but
use
me
like
a
friend
and
hear
my
story
it
happened
in
my
last
day
s
journey
on
the
road
i
overtook
a
man
of
quality
for
so
his
equipage
confessed
we
joined
and
fell
into
discourse
of
many
things
indifferent
till
from
a
chain
of
one
thing
to
another
we
chanced
to
talk
of
and
of
the
factions
there
and
i
soon
found
him
a
for
he
grew
hot
with
his
concern
for
that
prince
and
fiercely
owned
his
interest
this
pleased
me
and
i
grew
familiar
with
him
and
i
pleased
him
so
well
in
my
devotion
for
that
being
arrived
at
he
invites
me
home
to
his
palace
which
he
begged
i
would
make
use
of
as
my
own
during
my
stay
at
glad
of
the
opportunity
i
obeyed
and
soon
informed
myself
by
a
page
that
waited
on
him
to
whom
i
was
obliged
he
told
me
it
was
the
count
of
a
born
and
of
quality
who
for
some
disgust
at
court
retired
hither
that
he
was
a
person
of
much
gravity
a
great
politician
and
very
rich
and
though
well
in
years
was
lately
married
to
a
very
beautiful
young
lady
and
that
very
much
against
her
consent
a
lady
whom
he
had
taken
out
of
a
monastery
where
she
had
been
pensioned
from
a
child
and
of
whom
he
was
so
fond
and
jealous
he
never
would
permit
her
to
see
or
be
seen
by
any
man
and
if
she
took
the
air
in
her
coach
or
went
to
church
he
obliged
her
to
wear
a
veil
having
learned
thus
much
of
the
boy
i
dismissed
him
with
a
present
for
he
had
already
inspired
me
with
curiosity
that
prologue
to
love
and
i
knew
not
of
what
use
he
might
be
hereafter
a
curiosity
that
i
was
resolved
to
satisfy
though
i
broke
all
the
laws
of
hospitality
and
even
that
first
night
i
felt
an
impatience
that
gave
me
some
wonder
in
fine
three
days
i
languished
out
in
a
disorder
that
was
very
nearly
allied
to
that
of
love
i
found
myself
magnificently
lodged
attended
with
a
formal
ceremony
and
indeed
all
things
were
as
well
as
i
could
imagine
bating
a
kind
opportunity
to
get
a
sight
of
this
young
beauty
now
half
a
lover
grown
i
sighed
and
grew
oppressed
with
thought
and
had
recourse
to
groves
to
shady
walks
and
fountains
of
which
the
delicate
gardens
afforded
variety
the
most
resembling
nature
that
ever
art
produced
and
of
the
most
melancholy
recesses
fancying
there
in
some
lucky
hour
i
might
encounter
what
i
already
so
much
adored
in
which
still
i
formed
just
as
my
fancy
wished
there
for
the
first
two
days
i
walked
and
sighed
and
told
my
passion
to
every
gentle
wind
that
played
among
the
boughs
for
yet
no
lady
bright
appeared
beneath
them
no
visionary
nymph
the
groves
afforded
but
on
the
third
day
all
full
of
love
and
stratagem
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
i
passed
into
a
thicket
near
a
little
rivulet
that
purled
and
murmured
through
the
glade
and
passed
into
the
meads
this
pleased
and
fed
my
present
amorous
humour
and
down
i
laid
myself
on
the
shady
brink
and
listened
to
its
melancholy
glidings
when
from
behind
me
i
heard
a
sound
more
ravishing
a
voice
that
sung
these
words
alas
in
vain
you
pow
rs
above
you
gave
me
youth
you
gave
me
charms
and
ev
ry
tender
sense
of
love
to
destine
me
to
old
arms
ah
how
can
youth
s
gay
spring
allow
the
chilling
kisses
of
the
winter
s
snow
all
night
i
languish
by
his
side
and
fancy
joys
i
never
taste
as
men
in
dreams
a
feast
provide
and
waking
find
with
grief
they
fast
either
ye
gods
my
youthful
fires
allay
or
make
the
old
young
and
gay
like
a
fair
flower
in
shades
obscurity
though
every
sweet
adorns
my
head
ungather
d
unadmired
i
lie
and
wither
on
my
silent
gloomy
bed
while
no
kind
aids
to
my
relief
appear
and
no
kind
bosom
makes
me
triumph
there
by
this
you
may
easily
guess
as
i
soon
did
that
the
song
was
sung
by
madam
the
countess
of
as
indeed
it
was
at
the
very
beginning
of
her
song
my
joyful
soul
divined
it
so
i
rose
and
advanced
by
such
slow
degrees
as
neither
alarmed
the
fair
singer
nor
hindered
me
the
pleasure
of
hearing
any
part
of
the
song
till
i
approached
so
near
as
behind
the
shelter
of
some
jessamine
that
divided
us
i
unseen
completed
those
wounds
at
my
eyes
which
i
had
received
before
at
my
ears
yes
i
saw
the
lovely
leaning
on
a
pillow
made
of
some
of
those
jessamines
which
favoured
me
and
served
her
for
a
canopy
but
oh
my
friend
how
shall
i
present
her
to
thee
in
that
angel
form
she
then
appeared
to
me
all
young
all
ravishing
as
light
to
lost
benighted
travellers
her
face
the
fairest
in
the
world
was
adorned
with
curls
of
shining
jet
tied
up
i
know
not
how
all
carelessly
with
scarlet
ribbon
mixed
with
pearls
her
robe
was
gay
and
rich
such
as
young
royal
brides
put
on
when
they
undress
for
joys
her
eyes
were
black
the
softest
heaven
ever
made
her
mouth
was
sweet
and
formed
for
all
delight
so
red
her
lips
so
round
so
graced
with
dimples
that
without
one
other
charm
that
was
enough
to
kindle
warm
desires
about
a
frozen
heart
a
sprightly
air
of
wit
completed
all
increased
my
flame
and
made
me
mad
with
love
endless
it
were
to
tell
thee
all
her
beauties
nature
all
over
was
lavish
and
profuse
let
it
suffice
her
face
her
shape
her
mien
had
more
of
angel
in
them
than
humanity
i
saw
her
thus
all
charming
thus
she
lay
a
smiling
melancholy
dressed
her
eyes
which
she
had
fixed
upon
the
rivulet
near
which
i
found
her
lying
just
such
i
fancied
famed
was
when
first
beheld
her
nor
was
that
royal
ravisher
more
inflamed
than
i
or
readier
for
the
encounter
alone
she
was
which
heightened
my
desires
oh
gods
alone
lay
the
young
lovely
charmer
with
wishing
eyes
and
all
prepared
for
love
the
shade
was
gloomy
and
the
leaves
combined
so
close
they
must
have
given
us
warning
if
any
had
approached
from
either
side
all
favoured
my
design
and
i
advanced
but
with
such
caution
as
not
to
inspire
her
with
a
fear
instead
of
that
of
love
a
slow
uneasy
pace
with
folded
arms
love
in
my
eyes
and
burning
in
my
heart
at
my
approach
she
scarce
contained
her
cries
and
rose
surprised
and
blushing
discovering
to
me
such
a
proportioned
height
so
lovely
and
majestic
that
i
stood
gazing
on
her
all
lost
in
wonder
and
gave
her
time
to
dart
her
eyes
at
me
and
every
look
pierced
deeper
to
my
soul
and
i
had
no
sense
but
love
silent
admiring
love
immovable
i
stood
and
had
no
other
motion
but
that
of
a
heart
all
panting
which
lent
a
feeble
trembling
to
my
tongue
and
even
when
i
would
have
spoke
to
her
it
sent
a
sigh
up
to
prevent
my
boldness
and
oh
though
i
have
been
bred
in
all
the
saucy
daring
of
a
forward
lover
yet
now
i
wanted
a
convenient
impudence
awed
with
a
haughty
sweetness
in
her
look
like
a
fauxbrave
after
a
vigorous
onset
finding
the
danger
fly
so
thick
around
him
sheers
off
and
dares
not
face
the
pressing
foe
struck
with
too
fierce
a
lightning
from
her
eyes
whence
the
gods
sent
a
thousand
winged
darts
i
veiled
my
own
and
durst
not
play
with
fire
while
thus
she
hotly
did
pursue
her
conquest
and
i
stood
fixed
on
the
defensive
part
i
heard
a
rustling
among
the
leaves
and
through
their
mystic
windings
soon
perceived
the
good
old
count
of
approaching
muttering
and
mumbling
to
old
the
dragon
appointed
to
guard
this
lovely
treasure
and
which
she
having
left
alone
in
the
thicket
and
had
retired
but
at
an
awful
distance
had
most
extremely
disobliged
her
lord
i
only
had
time
enough
in
this
little
moment
to
look
with
eyes
that
asked
a
thousand
pities
and
told
her
in
their
silent
language
how
loath
they
were
to
leave
the
charming
object
and
with
a
sigh
i
vanished
from
the
wondering
fair
one
nimble
as
lightning
silent
as
a
shade
to
my
first
post
behind
the
jessamines
that
was
the
utmost
that
i
could
persuade
my
heart
to
do
you
may
believe
my
dear
i
did
not
bless
the
minute
that
brought
old
to
that
dear
recess
nor
him
nor
my
own
fate
and
to
complete
my
torment
i
saw
him
after
having
gravely
reproached
her
for
being
alone
without
her
woman
yes
i
saw
him
fall
on
her
neck
her
lovely
snowy
neck
and
loll
and
kiss
and
hang
his
tawny
withered
arms
on
her
fair
shoulders
and
press
his
nauseous
load
upon
body
for
so
i
heard
him
name
her
while
she
was
gazing
still
upon
the
empty
place
whence
she
had
seen
me
vanish
which
he
perceiving
cried
my
little
fool
what
is
it
thou
gazest
on
turn
to
thy
known
old
man
and
buss
him
soundly
when
putting
him
by
with
a
disdain
that
half
made
amends
for
the
injury
he
had
done
me
by
coming
ah
my
lord
cried
she
even
now
just
there
i
saw
a
lovely
vision
i
never
beheld
so
excellent
a
thing
how
cried
he
a
vision
a
thing
what
vision
what
thing
where
how
and
when
there
said
she
with
my
eyes
and
just
now
is
vanished
behind
yon
with
that
i
drew
my
sword
for
i
despaired
to
get
off
unknown
and
being
well
enough
acquainted
with
the
jealous
nature
of
the
spaniards
which
is
no
more
than
see
and
stab
i
prepared
to
stand
on
my
defence
till
i
could
reconcile
him
if
possible
to
reason
yet
even
in
that
moment
i
was
more
afraid
of
the
injury
he
might
do
the
innocent
fair
one
than
of
what
he
could
do
to
me
but
he
not
so
much
as
dreaming
she
meant
a
man
by
her
lovely
vision
fell
a
kissing
her
anew
and
beckoning
off
to
pimp
at
distance
told
her
the
grove
was
so
sweet
the
river
s
murmurs
so
delicate
and
she
was
so
curiously
dressed
that
all
together
had
inspired
him
with
a
and
then
assaulting
her
anew
with
a
sneer
which
you
have
seen
a
satyr
make
in
pictures
he
fell
to
act
the
little
tricks
of
youth
that
looked
so
goatish
in
him
instead
of
kindling
it
would
have
damped
a
flame
which
she
resisted
with
a
scorn
so
charming
gave
me
new
hope
and
fire
when
to
oblige
me
more
with
pride
disdain
and
loathing
in
her
eyes
she
fled
like
from
the
ravisher
he
being
bent
on
love
pursued
her
with
a
feeble
pace
like
an
old
chasing
some
coy
nymph
who
winged
with
fear
the
flying
wind
and
though
a
god
he
can
not
overtake
her
and
left
me
fainting
with
new
love
new
hope
new
jealousy
impatience
sighs
and
wishes
in
the
abandoned
grove
nor
could
i
go
without
another
view
of
that
dear
place
in
which
i
saw
her
lie
i
went
and
laid
me
down
just
on
the
print
which
her
fair
body
made
and
pressed
and
kissed
it
over
a
thousand
times
with
eager
transports
and
even
fancied
fair
there
there
twas
i
found
the
paper
with
the
song
which
i
have
sent
you
there
i
ran
over
a
thousand
stratagems
to
gain
another
view
no
little
statesman
had
more
plots
and
arts
than
i
to
gain
this
object
i
adored
the
soft
idea
of
my
burning
heart
now
raging
wild
abandoned
all
to
love
and
loose
desire
but
hitherto
my
industry
is
vain
each
day
i
haunt
the
thickest
groves
and
springs
the
flowery
walks
close
arbours
all
the
day
my
busy
eyes
and
heart
are
searching
her
but
no
intelligence
they
bring
me
in
in
fine
all
that
i
can
since
learn
is
that
the
bright
had
seen
a
vision
in
the
garden
and
ever
since
was
so
possessed
with
melancholy
that
she
had
not
since
quitted
her
chamber
she
is
daily
pressing
the
count
to
permit
her
to
go
into
the
garden
to
see
if
she
can
again
encounter
the
lovely
but
whether
from
any
description
she
hath
made
of
it
or
from
any
other
cause
he
imagines
how
it
was
i
know
not
but
he
endeavours
all
he
can
to
hinder
her
and
tells
her
it
is
not
lawful
to
tempt
heaven
by
invoking
an
apparition
so
that
till
a
second
view
eases
the
torments
of
my
mind
there
is
nothing
in
nature
to
be
conceived
so
raving
mad
as
i
as
if
my
despair
of
finding
her
again
increased
my
impatient
flame
instead
of
lessening
it
after
this
declaration
judge
who
has
given
the
greatest
proofs
of
his
friendship
you
or
i
you
being
my
rival
trust
me
with
the
secret
of
loving
my
mistress
which
can
no
way
redound
to
your
disadvantage
but
i
by
telling
you
the
secrets
of
my
soul
put
it
into
your
power
to
ruin
me
with
and
to
establish
yourself
in
her
heart
a
thought
i
yet
am
not
willing
to
bear
for
i
have
an
ambition
in
my
love
that
would
not
while
i
am
toiling
for
empire
here
lose
my
dominion
in
another
place
but
since
i
can
no
more
rule
a
woman
s
heart
than
a
lover
s
fate
both
you
and
may
deceive
my
opinion
in
that
but
shall
never
have
power
to
make
me
believe
you
less
my
friend
than
i
am
your
philander
postscript
enclosed
i
need
not
oblige
you
to
deliver
you
see
i
give
you
no
sooner
arrived
to
that
part
of
the
letter
which
named
the
count
of
but
he
stopped
and
was
scarce
able
to
proceed
for
the
charming
was
his
sister
the
only
one
he
had
who
having
been
bred
in
a
nunnery
was
taken
then
to
be
married
to
this
old
rich
count
who
had
a
great
fortune
before
he
proceeded
his
soul
divined
this
was
the
new
amour
that
had
engaged
the
heart
of
his
friend
he
was
afraid
to
be
farther
convinced
and
yet
a
curiosity
to
know
how
far
he
had
proceeded
made
him
read
it
out
with
all
the
disorder
of
a
man
jealous
of
his
honour
and
nicely
careful
of
his
fame
he
considered
her
young
about
eighteen
married
to
an
old
jealous
husband
no
parents
but
himself
to
right
her
wrongs
or
revenge
her
levity
he
knew
though
she
wanted
no
wit
she
did
art
for
being
bred
without
the
conversation
of
men
she
had
not
learnt
the
little
cunnings
of
her
sex
he
guessed
by
his
own
soul
that
hers
was
soft
and
apt
for
impression
he
judged
from
her
confession
to
her
husband
of
the
vision
that
she
had
a
simple
innocence
that
might
betray
a
young
beauty
under
such
circumstances
to
all
this
he
considered
the
charms
of
unresistible
his
unwearied
industry
in
love
and
concludes
his
sister
lost
at
first
he
upbraids
and
calls
him
ungrateful
but
soon
thought
it
unreasonable
to
accuse
himself
of
an
injustice
and
excused
the
frailty
of
since
he
knew
not
that
she
whom
he
adored
was
sister
to
his
friend
however
it
failed
not
to
possess
him
with
inquietude
that
exercised
all
his
wit
to
consider
how
he
might
prevent
an
irreparable
injury
to
his
honour
and
an
intrigue
that
possibly
might
cost
his
sister
her
life
as
well
as
fame
in
the
midst
of
all
these
torments
he
forgot
not
the
more
important
business
of
his
love
for
to
a
lover
who
has
his
soul
perfectly
fixed
on
the
fair
object
of
its
adoration
whatever
other
thoughts
fatigue
and
cloud
his
mind
that
like
a
soft
gleam
of
new
sprung
light
darts
in
and
spreads
a
glory
all
around
and
like
the
god
of
day
cheers
every
drooping
vital
yet
even
these
dearer
thoughts
wanted
not
their
torments
at
first
he
strove
to
atone
for
the
fears
of
with
those
of
imagining
false
to
well
cried
he
if
thou
be
st
lost
at
least
thy
ruin
has
laid
a
foundation
for
my
happiness
and
every
triumph
makes
of
thy
virtue
it
the
more
secures
my
empire
over
and
since
the
brother
can
not
be
happy
but
by
the
sister
s
being
undone
yield
thou
o
faithless
fair
one
yield
to
and
make
me
blest
in
and
thou
continued
he
oh
perjured
lover
and
inconstant
friend
glut
thy
insatiate
flame
rifle
of
every
virtue
heaven
and
nature
gave
her
so
i
may
but
revenge
it
on
thy
pleased
with
this
joyful
hope
he
traverses
his
chamber
glowing
and
blushing
with
new
kindling
fire
his
heart
that
was
all
gay
diffused
a
gladness
that
expressed
itself
in
every
feature
of
his
lovely
face
his
eyes
that
were
by
nature
languishing
shone
now
with
an
unusual
air
of
briskness
smiles
graced
his
mouth
and
dimples
dressed
his
face
insensibly
his
busy
fingers
trick
and
dress
and
set
his
hair
and
without
designing
it
his
feet
are
bearing
him
to
till
he
stopped
short
and
wondered
whither
he
was
going
for
yet
it
was
not
time
to
make
his
visit
whither
fond
heart
said
he
o
whither
wouldst
thou
hurry
this
slave
to
thy
soft
fires
and
now
returning
back
he
paused
and
fell
to
thought
he
remembered
how
impatiently
waited
the
return
of
the
answer
he
writ
to
him
wherein
he
owned
his
passion
for
that
beauty
he
knew
she
permitted
him
to
write
it
more
to
raise
the
little
brisk
fires
of
jealousy
in
and
to
set
an
edge
on
his
blunted
love
than
from
any
favours
she
designed
and
that
on
this
answer
depended
all
her
happiness
or
the
confirmation
of
her
doubts
and
that
she
would
measure
love
by
the
effects
she
found
there
of
it
so
that
never
lover
had
so
hard
a
game
to
play
as
our
new
one
he
knew
he
had
it
now
in
his
power
to
ruin
his
rival
and
to
make
almost
his
own
terms
with
his
fair
conqueress
but
he
considered
the
secret
was
not
rendered
him
for
so
base
an
end
nor
could
his
love
advance
itself
by
ways
so
false
dull
and
criminal
between
each
thought
he
paused
and
now
resolves
she
must
know
he
sent
an
answer
to
his
letter
for
should
she
know
he
had
and
that
he
should
refuse
her
the
sight
of
it
he
believed
with
reason
she
ought
to
banish
him
for
ever
her
presence
as
the
most
disobedient
of
her
slaves
he
walks
and
pauses
on
but
no
kind
thought
presents
itself
to
save
him
either
way
he
finds
himself
undone
and
from
the
most
gay
and
most
triumphing
lover
on
the
earth
he
now
with
one
desirous
thought
of
right
reasoning
finds
he
is
the
most
miserable
of
all
the
creation
he
reads
the
superscription
of
that
writ
to
which
was
enclosed
in
his
and
finds
it
was
directed
only
for
which
would
plainly
demonstrate
it
came
not
so
into
but
that
some
other
cover
secured
it
so
that
never
any
but
the
most
nice
in
honour
had
ever
so
great
a
contest
with
love
and
friendship
for
his
noble
temper
was
not
one
of
those
that
could
sacrifice
his
friend
to
his
little
lusts
or
his
more
solid
passion
but
truly
brave
resolves
now
rather
to
die
than
to
confess
secret
to
evade
which
he
sent
her
letter
by
his
page
with
one
from
himself
and
commanded
him
to
tell
her
that
he
was
going
to
receive
some
commands
from
the
prince
of
and
that
he
would
wait
on
her
himself
in
the
evening
the
page
obeys
and
sent
him
with
a
sigh
and
eyes
that
languishingly
told
him
he
did
it
with
regret
the
page
hastening
to
finds
her
in
all
the
disquiet
of
an
expecting
lover
and
snatching
the
papers
from
his
hand
the
first
she
saw
was
that
from
at
which
she
trembled
with
fear
and
joy
for
hope
love
and
despair
at
once
seized
her
and
hardly
able
to
make
a
sign
with
her
hand
for
the
boy
to
withdraw
she
sank
down
into
her
chair
all
pale
and
almost
fainting
but
her
courage
she
opened
it
and
read
this
philander
sylvia
ah
why
all
these
doubts
and
fears
why
at
this
distance
do
you
accuse
your
lover
when
he
is
incapable
to
fall
before
you
and
undeceive
your
little
jealousies
oh
i
fear
this
first
reproaching
me
is
rather
the
effects
of
your
own
guilt
than
any
that
love
can
make
you
think
of
mine
yes
yes
my
it
is
the
waves
that
roll
and
glide
away
and
not
the
steady
shore
tis
you
begin
to
unfasten
from
the
vows
that
hold
you
and
float
along
the
flattering
tide
of
vanity
it
is
you
whose
pride
and
beauty
scorning
to
be
confined
give
way
to
the
admiring
crowd
that
sigh
for
you
yes
yes
you
like
the
rest
of
your
fair
glorious
sex
love
the
admirer
though
you
hate
the
coxcomb
it
is
vain
it
is
great
and
shews
your
beauty
s
power
is
it
possible
that
for
the
safety
of
my
life
i
can
not
retire
but
you
must
think
i
am
fled
from
love
and
or
is
it
possible
that
pitying
tenderness
that
made
me
incapable
of
taking
leave
of
her
should
be
interpreted
as
false
and
base
and
that
an
absence
of
thirty
days
so
forc
d
and
so
compelled
must
render
me
inconstant
lost
ungrateful
as
if
that
after
heaven
ever
made
a
beauty
that
could
charm
me
you
charge
my
letter
with
a
thousand
faults
it
is
short
it
is
cold
and
wants
those
usual
softnesses
that
gave
them
all
their
welcome
and
their
graces
i
fear
my
loves
the
flatterer
and
not
the
man
the
lover
only
not
and
she
considers
him
not
for
himself
but
the
gay
glorious
thing
he
makes
of
her
ah
too
is
that
your
justice
you
never
allow
for
my
unhappy
circumstances
you
never
think
how
care
oppresses
me
nor
what
my
love
contributes
to
that
care
how
business
danger
and
a
thousand
ills
take
up
my
harrassed
mind
by
every
power
i
love
thee
still
my
but
time
has
made
us
more
familiar
now
and
we
begin
to
leave
off
ceremony
and
come
to
closer
joys
to
join
our
interests
now
as
people
fixed
resolved
to
live
and
die
together
to
weave
our
thoughts
and
be
united
stronger
at
first
we
shew
the
gayest
side
of
love
dress
and
be
nice
in
every
word
and
look
set
out
for
conquest
all
spread
every
art
use
every
stratagem
but
when
the
toil
is
past
and
the
dear
victory
gained
we
then
propose
a
little
idle
rest
a
little
easy
slumber
we
then
embrace
lay
by
the
gaudy
shew
the
plumes
and
gilded
equipage
of
love
the
trappings
of
the
conqueror
and
bring
the
naked
lover
to
your
arms
we
shew
him
then
uncased
with
all
his
little
disadvantages
perhaps
the
flowing
hair
those
ebony
curls
you
have
so
often
combed
and
dressed
and
kissed
are
then
put
up
and
shew
a
fiercer
air
more
like
an
antique
than
and
shall
i
then
because
i
want
a
grace
be
thought
to
love
you
less
because
the
embroidered
coat
the
point
and
garniture
s
laid
by
must
i
put
off
my
passion
with
my
dress
no
love
allows
a
thousand
little
freedoms
allows
me
to
unbosom
all
my
secrets
tell
thee
my
wants
my
fears
complaints
and
dangers
and
think
it
great
relief
if
thou
but
sigh
and
pity
me
and
oft
thy
charming
wit
has
aided
me
but
now
i
find
thee
adding
to
my
pain
o
where
shall
i
unload
my
weight
of
cares
when
who
was
wont
to
sigh
and
weep
and
suffer
me
to
ease
the
heavy
burden
now
grows
displeased
and
peevish
with
my
moans
and
calls
them
the
effects
of
dying
love
instead
of
those
dear
smiles
that
fond
bewitching
prattle
that
used
to
calm
my
roughest
storm
of
grief
she
now
reproaches
me
with
coldness
want
of
concern
and
lover
s
rhetoric
and
when
i
seem
to
beg
relief
and
shew
my
soul
s
resentment
it
is
then
i
m
false
it
is
my
aversion
or
the
effects
of
some
new
kindling
flame
is
this
fair
dealing
can
i
not
spare
a
little
sigh
from
love
but
you
must
think
i
rob
you
of
your
due
if
i
omit
a
tender
name
by
which
i
used
to
call
you
must
i
be
thought
to
lose
that
passion
that
taught
me
such
endearments
and
must
i
never
reflect
upon
the
ruin
both
of
my
fame
and
fortune
but
i
must
run
the
risk
of
losing
too
oh
cruelty
of
love
oh
too
too
fond
and
jealous
maid
what
crimes
thy
innocent
passion
can
create
when
it
extends
beyond
the
bounds
of
reason
ah
too
too
nicely
tender
that
will
not
give
me
leave
to
cast
a
thought
back
on
my
former
glory
yet
even
that
loss
i
could
support
with
tameness
and
content
if
i
believed
my
suffering
reached
only
to
my
heart
but
if
she
love
must
feel
my
torments
too
must
share
my
loss
and
want
a
thousand
ornaments
my
sinking
fortune
can
not
purchase
her
believe
me
charming
creature
if
i
should
love
you
less
i
have
a
sense
so
just
of
what
you
have
suffered
for
i
d
be
content
to
be
a
to
give
thy
beauty
birth
and
love
their
due
but
as
i
am
thy
faithful
lover
still
depend
upon
that
fortune
heaven
has
left
me
which
if
thou
canst
as
thou
hast
often
sworn
then
thou
would
st
submit
to
be
cheerful
still
be
gay
and
confident
and
do
not
judge
my
heart
by
little
words
my
heart
too
great
and
fond
for
such
poor
demonstrations
you
ask
me
where
i
am
and
what
i
do
and
all
i
can
say
is
that
at
present
i
am
safe
from
any
fears
of
being
delivered
up
to
and
what
i
do
is
sighing
dying
grieving
i
want
my
but
my
circumstances
yet
have
nothing
to
encourage
that
hope
when
i
resolve
where
to
settle
you
shall
see
what
haste
i
will
make
to
have
you
brought
to
me
i
am
impatient
to
hear
from
you
and
to
know
how
that
dear
pledge
of
our
soft
hours
advances
i
mean
what
i
believe
i
left
thee
possessed
of
a
young
cherish
it
for
that
is
a
certain
obligation
to
keep
a
dying
fire
alive
be
sure
you
do
it
no
hurt
by
your
unnecessary
grief
though
there
needs
no
other
tie
but
that
of
love
to
make
me
more
entirely
philander
if
fears
were
great
before
she
opened
the
letter
what
were
her
pains
when
all
those
fears
were
confirmed
from
that
mark
of
a
declining
love
the
coldness
and
alteration
of
the
style
of
letters
that
first
symptom
of
a
dying
flame
o
where
said
she
oh
perjured
charmer
is
all
that
ardency
that
used
to
warm
the
reader
where
is
all
that
natural
innocence
of
love
that
could
not
even
to
discover
and
express
a
grace
in
eloquence
force
one
soft
word
or
one
passion
oh
continued
she
he
is
lost
and
gone
from
and
his
vows
some
other
has
him
all
clasps
that
dear
body
hangs
upon
that
face
gazes
upon
his
eyes
and
listens
to
his
voice
when
he
is
looking
sighing
swearing
dying
lying
and
damning
of
himself
for
some
new
beauty
he
is
i
will
not
endure
it
aid
me
oh
where
is
the
perjured
traitor
who
was
waiting
on
her
seeing
her
rise
on
the
sudden
in
so
great
a
fury
would
have
stayed
her
hasty
turns
and
ravings
beseeching
her
to
tell
her
what
was
the
occasion
and
by
a
discovery
to
ease
her
heart
but
she
with
all
the
fury
imaginable
flung
from
her
arms
and
ran
to
the
table
and
snatching
up
a
penknife
had
certainly
sent
it
to
her
heart
had
not
stepped
to
her
and
caught
her
hand
which
she
resisted
not
and
blushing
resigned
with
telling
her
she
was
ashamed
of
her
own
cowardice
for
said
she
if
it
had
designed
to
have
been
brave
i
had
sent
you
off
and
by
a
noble
resolution
have
freed
this
slave
within
striking
her
breast
from
a
tyranny
which
it
should
disdain
to
suffer
under
with
that
she
raged
about
the
chamber
with
broken
words
and
imperfect
threatenings
unconsidered
imprecations
and
unheeded
vows
and
oaths
at
which
redoubled
her
petition
to
know
the
cause
and
she
replied
the
dear
the
soft
the
fond
and
charming
is
now
no
more
the
same
o
said
she
didst
thou
but
see
this
letter
compared
to
those
of
heretofore
when
love
was
gay
and
young
when
new
desire
dressed
his
soft
eyes
in
tears
and
taught
his
tongue
the
harmony
of
angels
when
every
tender
word
had
more
of
passion
than
volumes
of
this
forced
this
trifling
business
oh
thou
wouldst
say
i
were
the
wretchedest
thing
that
ever
nature
made
oh
thou
wouldst
curse
as
i
do
not
the
dear
murderer
but
thy
frantic
self
thy
mad
deceived
believing
easy
self
if
thou
wert
so
undone
then
while
she
wept
she
gave
liberty
to
speak
which
was
to
persuade
her
her
fears
were
vain
she
urged
every
argument
of
love
she
had
been
witness
to
and
could
not
think
it
possible
he
could
be
false
to
all
which
the
still
weeping
lent
a
willing
ear
for
lovers
are
much
inclined
to
believe
every
thing
they
wish
having
a
little
calmed
her
continued
telling
her
that
to
be
better
convinced
of
his
love
or
his
perfidy
she
ought
to
have
patience
till
should
come
to
visit
her
for
you
have
forgotten
madam
said
she
that
the
generous
rival
has
sent
him
word
he
is
your
lover
for
was
waiting
at
the
reading
of
that
letter
nor
was
there
any
thing
the
concealed
from
that
servant
and
women
who
have
made
a
breach
in
their
honour
are
seldom
so
careful
of
their
rest
of
fame
as
those
who
have
a
stock
entire
and
believed
after
she
had
entrusted
the
secret
of
one
amour
to
her
discretion
she
might
conceal
none
madam
says
here
is
a
letter
yet
unread
who
had
been
a
great
while
impatient
for
the
return
of
answer
from
expecting
from
thence
the
confirmation
of
all
her
doubts
hastily
snatched
the
letter
out
of
hand
and
read
it
hoping
to
have
found
something
there
to
have
eased
her
soul
one
way
or
other
a
soul
the
most
raging
and
haughty
by
nature
that
ever
possessed
a
body
the
words
were
these
octavio
sylvia
at
least
you
will
pity
me
oh
charming
when
you
shall
call
to
mind
the
cruel
services
i
am
obliged
to
render
you
to
be
the
messenger
of
love
from
him
whom
beauty
and
that
god
plead
so
strongly
for
already
in
your
heart
if
after
this
you
can
propose
a
torture
that
yet
may
speak
my
passion
and
obedience
in
any
higher
measure
command
and
try
my
fortitude
for
i
too
well
divine
o
rigorous
beauty
the
business
of
your
slave
will
be
only
to
give
you
proofs
how
much
he
does
adore
you
and
never
to
taste
a
joy
even
in
a
distant
hope
like
lamps
in
urns
my
lasting
fire
must
burn
without
one
kind
material
to
supply
it
ah
if
ever
it
be
thy
wretched
fate
to
see
the
lord
of
all
your
vows
given
to
another
s
arms
when
you
shall
see
in
those
soft
eyes
that
you
adore
a
languishment
and
joy
if
you
but
name
another
beauty
to
him
when
you
behold
his
blushes
fade
and
rise
at
the
approaches
of
another
mistress
hear
broken
sighs
and
unassured
replies
whenever
he
answers
some
new
conqueress
tremblings
and
pantings
seizing
every
part
at
the
warm
touch
as
of
a
second
charmer
ah
do
but
do
me
justice
then
and
sighing
say
i
pity
poor
take
here
a
letter
from
the
blest
which
i
had
brought
myself
but
can
not
bear
the
torment
of
that
joy
that
i
shall
see
advancing
in
your
eyes
when
you
shall
read
it
over
no
it
is
too
much
that
i
imagine
all
yet
bless
that
patient
fondness
of
my
passion
that
makes
me
still
your
slave
and
your
adorer
octavio
at
finishing
this
the
jealous
fair
one
redoubled
her
tears
with
such
violence
that
it
was
in
vain
her
woman
strove
to
abate
the
flowing
tide
by
all
the
reasonable
arguments
she
could
bring
to
her
aid
and
to
increase
it
read
again
the
latter
part
of
the
ominous
letter
which
she
wet
with
the
tears
that
streamed
from
her
bright
eyes
yes
yes
cried
she
laying
the
letter
down
i
know
this
is
no
prophecy
of
yours
but
a
known
truth
alas
you
know
too
well
the
fatal
time
is
already
come
when
i
shall
find
these
changes
in
ah
madam
replied
how
curious
are
you
to
search
out
torment
for
your
own
heart
and
as
much
a
lover
as
you
are
how
little
do
you
understand
the
arts
and
politics
of
love
alas
madam
continued
she
you
yourself
have
armed
my
lord
with
these
weapons
that
wound
you
the
last
time
he
writ
to
my
lord
he
found
you
possessed
with
a
thousand
fears
and
jealousies
of
these
he
took
advantage
to
attack
his
rival
for
what
man
is
there
so
dull
that
would
not
assault
his
enemy
in
that
part
where
the
most
considerable
mischief
may
be
done
him
it
is
now
interest
and
his
business
to
render
false
to
give
you
all
the
umbrage
that
is
possible
of
so
powerful
a
rival
and
to
say
any
thing
that
may
render
him
hateful
to
you
or
at
least
to
make
him
love
you
away
replied
with
an
uneasy
smile
how
foolish
are
thy
reasonings
for
were
it
possible
i
could
love
less
is
it
to
be
imagined
that
should
make
way
for
in
my
heart
or
any
after
that
dear
deceiver
no
doubt
of
it
replied
but
that
very
effect
it
would
have
on
your
heart
for
love
in
the
soul
of
a
witty
person
is
like
a
skein
of
silk
to
unwind
it
from
the
bottom
you
must
wind
it
on
another
or
it
runs
into
confusion
and
becomes
of
no
use
and
then
of
course
as
one
lessens
the
other
increases
and
what
loses
in
love
or
some
one
industrious
lover
will
most
certainly
replied
you
are
a
great
philosopher
in
i
should
madam
cried
had
i
but
had
a
good
memory
for
i
had
a
young
churchman
once
in
love
with
me
who
has
read
many
a
philosophical
lecture
to
me
upon
love
among
the
rest
he
used
to
say
the
soul
was
all
composed
of
love
i
used
to
ask
him
then
if
it
were
formed
of
so
soft
materials
how
it
came
to
pass
that
we
were
no
oftener
in
love
or
why
so
many
were
so
long
before
they
loved
and
others
who
never
loved
at
all
no
question
but
he
answered
you
wisely
said
carelessly
and
sighing
with
her
thoughts
but
half
attentive
marry
and
so
he
did
cried
at
least
i
thought
so
then
because
i
loved
a
little
he
said
love
of
itself
was
inactive
but
it
was
informed
by
object
and
then
too
that
object
must
depend
on
fancy
for
souls
though
all
love
are
not
to
love
all
now
fancy
he
said
was
sometimes
nice
humorous
and
fantastic
which
is
the
reason
we
so
often
love
those
of
no
merit
and
despise
those
that
are
most
excellent
and
sometimes
fancy
guides
us
to
like
neither
he
used
to
say
women
were
like
misers
though
they
had
always
love
in
store
they
seldom
cared
to
part
with
it
but
on
very
good
interest
and
security
per
most
commonly
heart
for
heart
at
least
and
for
security
he
said
we
were
most
times
too
unconscionable
we
asked
vows
at
least
at
worst
matrimony
half
angry
cried
and
what
is
all
this
to
my
loving
again
oh
madam
replied
he
said
a
woman
was
like
a
gamester
if
on
the
winning
hand
hope
interest
and
vanity
made
him
play
on
besides
the
pleasure
of
the
play
itself
if
on
the
losing
then
he
continued
throwing
at
all
to
save
a
stake
at
last
if
not
to
recover
all
so
either
way
they
find
occasion
to
continue
the
but
oh
said
sighing
what
shall
that
gamester
set
who
has
already
played
for
all
he
had
and
lost
it
at
a
cast
o
madam
replied
young
and
fair
find
credit
every
where
there
is
still
a
prospect
of
a
return
and
that
gamester
that
plays
thus
upon
the
tick
is
sure
to
lose
but
little
and
if
they
win
it
is
all
clear
i
find
said
you
are
a
good
manager
in
love
you
are
for
the
frugal
part
of
faith
madam
said
i
am
indeed
of
that
opinion
that
love
and
interest
always
do
best
together
as
two
most
excellent
ingredients
in
that
rare
art
of
preserving
of
beauty
love
makes
us
put
on
all
our
charms
and
interest
gives
us
all
the
advantage
of
dress
without
which
beauty
is
lost
and
of
little
use
love
would
have
us
appear
always
new
always
gay
and
magnificent
and
money
alone
can
render
us
so
and
we
find
no
women
want
lovers
so
much
as
those
who
want
petticoats
jewels
and
all
the
necessary
trifles
of
gallantry
of
this
last
opinion
i
find
you
yourself
to
be
for
even
when
comes
on
whose
heart
you
have
no
design
i
see
you
dress
to
the
best
advantage
and
put
on
many
to
like
one
why
is
this
but
that
even
unknown
to
yourself
you
have
a
secret
joy
and
pleasure
in
gaining
conquests
and
of
being
adored
and
thought
the
most
charming
of
your
sex
that
is
not
from
the
inconstancy
of
my
heart
cried
but
from
the
little
vanity
of
our
oh
madam
replied
there
is
no
friend
to
love
like
vanity
it
is
the
falsest
betrayer
of
a
woman
s
heart
of
any
passion
not
love
itself
betrays
her
sooner
to
love
than
vanity
or
pride
and
madam
i
would
i
might
have
the
pleasure
of
my
next
wish
when
i
find
you
not
only
listening
to
the
love
of
but
even
approving
it
away
replied
in
frowning
your
mirth
grows
rude
and
troublesome
go
bid
the
page
wait
while
i
return
an
answer
to
what
his
lord
has
sent
so
sitting
at
the
table
she
dismissed
and
writ
this
following
letter
sylvia
octavio
i
find
this
little
gallantry
of
yours
of
shewing
me
the
lover
stands
you
in
very
great
stead
and
serves
you
upon
all
occasions
for
abundance
of
uses
amongst
the
rest
it
is
no
small
obligation
you
have
to
it
for
furnishing
you
with
handsome
pretences
to
keep
from
those
who
importune
you
and
from
giving
them
that
satisfaction
by
your
counsel
and
conversation
which
possibly
the
unfortunate
may
have
need
of
sometimes
and
when
you
are
pressed
and
obliged
to
render
me
the
friendship
of
your
visits
this
necessary
ready
love
of
yours
is
the
only
evasion
you
have
for
the
answering
a
thousand
little
questions
i
ask
you
of
whose
heart
i
am
afraid
you
know
much
better
than
does
i
could
almost
wish
that
all
you
tell
me
of
your
passion
were
true
that
my
commands
might
be
of
force
sufficient
to
compel
you
to
resolve
my
heart
in
some
doubts
that
oppress
it
and
indeed
if
you
would
have
me
believe
the
one
you
must
obey
me
in
the
other
to
which
end
i
conjure
you
to
hasten
to
me
for
something
of
an
unusual
coldness
in
letter
and
some
ominous
divinations
in
yours
have
put
me
on
a
rack
of
thought
from
which
nothing
but
confirmation
can
relieve
me
this
you
dare
not
deny
if
you
value
the
repose
of
sylvia
she
read
it
over
and
was
often
about
to
tear
it
fancying
it
was
too
kind
but
when
she
considered
it
was
from
no
other
inclination
of
her
heart
than
that
of
getting
the
secrets
out
of
his
she
pardoned
herself
the
little
levity
she
found
it
guilty
of
all
which
considering
as
the
effects
of
the
violent
passion
she
had
for
she
found
it
easy
to
do
and
sealing
it
she
gave
it
to
to
deliver
to
the
page
and
set
herself
down
to
ease
her
soul
of
its
heavy
weight
of
grief
by
her
complaints
to
the
dear
author
of
her
pain
for
when
a
lover
is
insupportably
afflicted
there
is
no
ease
like
that
of
writing
to
the
person
loved
and
that
all
that
comes
uppermost
in
the
soul
for
true
love
is
all
unthinking
artless
speaking
incorrect
disorder
and
without
method
as
tis
without
bounds
or
rules
such
were
unstudied
thoughts
and
such
her
following
letter
sylvia
philander
oh
my
how
hard
it
is
to
bring
my
soul
to
doubt
when
i
consider
all
thy
past
tender
vows
when
i
reflect
how
thou
hast
loved
and
sworn
methinks
i
hear
the
music
of
thy
voice
still
whispering
in
my
bosom
methinks
the
charming
softness
of
thy
words
remains
like
lessening
echoes
of
my
soul
whose
distant
voices
by
degrees
decay
till
they
be
heard
no
more
alas
i
ve
read
thy
letter
over
and
over
and
turned
the
sense
a
thousand
several
ways
and
all
to
make
it
speak
and
look
like
love
oh
i
have
flattered
it
with
all
my
heart
sometimes
i
fancied
my
ill
reading
spoiled
it
and
then
i
tuned
my
voice
to
softer
notes
and
read
it
over
again
but
still
the
words
appeared
too
rough
and
harsh
for
any
moving
air
i
which
way
soever
i
changed
which
way
soever
i
questioned
it
of
love
it
answered
in
such
language
as
others
would
perhaps
interpret
love
or
something
like
it
but
i
who
ve
heard
the
very
god
himself
speak
from
thy
wondrous
lips
and
known
him
guide
thy
pen
when
all
the
eloquence
of
moving
angels
flowed
from
thy
charming
tongue
when
i
have
seen
thee
fainting
at
my
feet
whilst
all
heaven
opened
in
thy
glorious
face
and
now
and
then
sigh
out
a
trembling
word
in
which
there
was
contained
more
love
more
soul
than
all
the
arts
of
speaking
ever
found
what
sense
oh
what
reflections
must
i
make
on
this
decay
this
strange
this
sudden
alteration
in
thee
but
that
the
cause
is
fled
and
the
effect
is
ceased
the
god
retired
and
all
the
oracles
silenced
confess
oh
thou
eternal
conqueror
of
my
soul
whom
every
hour
and
every
tender
joy
renders
more
dear
and
lovely
tell
me
why
if
thou
still
lovest
me
and
lovest
as
well
does
love
not
dictate
to
thee
as
before
dost
thou
want
words
oh
then
begin
again
i
repeat
the
old
ones
over
ten
thousand
times
such
repetitions
are
love
s
rhetoric
how
often
have
i
asked
thee
in
an
hour
when
my
fond
soul
was
doting
on
thy
eyes
when
with
my
arms
clasping
thy
yielding
neck
my
lips
imprinting
kisses
on
thy
cheeks
and
taking
in
the
breath
that
sighed
from
thine
how
often
have
i
asked
this
little
but
important
question
of
thee
does
my
love
me
then
kiss
thee
for
thy
yes
and
sighs
and
ask
again
and
still
my
soul
was
ravished
with
new
joy
when
thou
wouldst
answer
yes
i
love
thee
dearly
and
if
i
thought
you
spoke
it
with
a
tone
that
seemed
less
soft
and
fervent
than
i
wished
i
asked
so
often
till
i
made
thee
answer
in
such
a
voice
as
i
would
wish
to
hear
it
all
this
had
been
impertinent
and
foolish
in
any
thing
but
love
to
any
but
a
lover
but
oh
give
me
the
impertinence
of
love
talk
little
nonsense
to
me
all
the
day
and
be
as
wanton
as
a
playing
and
that
will
please
and
charm
my
heart
better
than
all
fine
sense
and
reasoning
tell
me
what
new
accident
what
powerful
misfortune
has
befallen
thee
greater
than
what
we
have
experienced
yet
to
drive
the
little
god
out
of
thy
heart
and
make
thee
so
unlike
my
soft
what
place
contains
thee
or
what
pleasures
ease
thee
that
thou
art
now
contented
to
live
a
tedious
day
without
thy
how
then
the
long
long
age
of
forty
more
and
yet
thou
livest
art
patient
tame
and
well
thou
talkest
not
now
of
ravings
or
of
dying
but
look
st
about
thee
like
a
well
pleased
conqueror
after
the
toils
of
battle
oh
i
have
known
a
time
but
let
me
never
think
upon
it
more
it
can
not
be
remembered
without
madness
what
think
thee
fallen
from
love
to
think
that
i
must
never
hear
thee
more
pouring
thy
soul
out
in
soft
sighs
of
love
a
thousand
dear
expressions
by
which
i
knew
the
story
of
thy
heart
and
while
you
tell
it
bid
me
feel
it
panting
never
to
see
thy
eyes
fixed
on
my
face
till
the
soft
showers
of
joy
would
gently
fall
and
hang
their
shining
dew
upon
thy
looks
then
in
a
transport
snatch
me
to
thy
bosom
and
sigh
a
thousand
times
ere
thou
couldst
utter
ah
how
i
love
thee
oh
the
dear
eloquence
those
few
short
words
contain
when
they
are
sent
with
lovers
accents
to
a
soul
all
languishing
but
now
alas
thy
love
is
more
familiar
grown
oh
take
the
other
part
of
the
proverb
too
and
say
it
has
bred
contempt
for
nothing
less
than
that
your
letter
shews
but
more
it
does
and
that
is
indifference
less
to
be
borne
than
hate
or
any
thing
at
least
be
just
and
let
me
know
my
doom
do
not
deceive
the
heart
that
trusted
all
thy
vows
if
thou
be
st
generous
if
thou
lettest
me
know
thy
date
of
love
is
out
for
love
perhaps
as
life
has
dates
and
equally
uncertain
and
thou
no
more
canst
stay
the
one
than
the
other
yet
if
thou
art
so
kind
for
all
my
honour
lost
my
youth
undone
my
beauty
tarnished
and
my
lasting
vows
to
let
me
fairly
know
thou
art
departing
my
worthless
life
will
be
the
only
loss
but
if
thou
still
continuest
to
impose
upon
my
easy
faith
and
i
should
any
other
way
learn
my
approaching
fate
look
to
it
she
that
had
the
courage
to
abandon
all
for
love
and
faithless
thee
can
when
she
finds
herself
betrayed
and
lost
nobly
revenge
the
ruin
of
her
fame
and
send
thee
to
the
other
world
with
sylvia
she
having
writ
this
read
it
over
and
fancied
she
had
not
spoke
half
the
sense
of
her
soul
fancied
if
she
were
again
to
begin
she
could
express
herself
much
more
to
the
purpose
she
designed
than
she
had
done
she
began
again
and
writ
two
or
three
new
ones
but
they
were
either
too
kind
or
too
rough
the
first
she
feared
would
shew
a
weakness
of
spirit
since
he
had
given
her
occasion
of
jealousy
the
last
she
feared
would
disoblige
if
all
those
jealousies
were
false
she
therefore
tore
those
last
she
had
writ
and
before
she
sealed
up
the
first
she
read
letter
again
but
still
ended
it
with
fears
that
did
not
lessen
those
she
had
first
conceived
still
she
thought
she
had
more
to
say
as
lovers
do
who
are
never
weary
of
speaking
or
writing
to
the
dear
object
of
their
vows
and
having
already
forgotten
what
she
had
just
said
before
and
her
heart
being
by
this
time
as
full
as
ere
she
began
she
took
up
her
complaining
pen
and
made
it
say
this
in
the
covert
of
the
letter
oh
oh
thou
eternal
charmer
of
my
soul
how
fain
i
would
repent
me
of
the
cruel
thoughts
i
have
of
thee
when
i
had
finished
this
enclosed
i
read
again
thy
chilling
letter
and
strove
with
all
the
force
of
love
and
soft
imagination
to
find
a
dear
occasion
of
asking
pardon
for
those
fears
which
press
my
breaking
heart
but
oh
the
more
i
read
the
more
they
strike
upon
my
tenderest
part
something
so
very
cold
so
careless
and
indifferent
you
end
your
letter
with
i
will
not
think
of
it
by
heaven
it
makes
me
rave
and
hate
my
little
power
that
could
no
longer
keep
thee
soft
and
kind
oh
if
those
killing
fears
bred
by
excess
of
love
are
vainly
taken
up
in
pity
my
adorable
in
pity
to
my
tortured
soul
convince
them
redress
the
torment
of
my
jealous
doubts
and
either
way
confirm
me
be
kind
to
her
that
dies
and
languishes
for
thee
return
me
all
the
softness
that
first
charmed
me
or
frankly
tell
me
my
approaching
fate
be
generous
or
be
kind
to
the
unfortunate
and
undone
sylvia
she
thought
she
had
ended
here
but
here
again
she
read
letter
as
if
on
purpose
to
find
new
torments
out
for
a
heart
too
much
pressed
already
a
sour
that
is
always
mixed
with
the
sweets
of
love
a
pain
that
ever
accompanies
the
pleasure
love
else
were
not
to
be
numbered
among
the
passions
of
men
and
was
at
first
ordained
in
heaven
for
some
divine
motion
of
the
soul
till
with
his
loss
of
debauched
it
with
jealousies
fears
and
curiosities
and
mixed
it
with
all
that
was
afflicting
but
you
ll
say
he
had
reason
to
be
jealous
whose
woman
for
want
of
other
seducers
listened
to
the
serpent
and
for
the
love
of
change
would
give
way
even
to
a
devil
this
little
love
of
novelty
and
knowledge
has
been
entailed
upon
her
daughters
ever
since
and
i
have
known
more
women
rendered
unhappy
and
miserable
from
this
torment
of
curiosity
which
they
bring
upon
themselves
than
have
ever
been
undone
by
less
villainous
men
one
of
this
humour
was
our
haughty
and
charming
whose
pride
and
beauty
possessing
her
with
a
belief
that
all
men
were
born
to
die
her
slaves
made
her
uneasy
at
every
action
of
the
lover
whether
beloved
or
not
that
did
but
seem
to
slight
her
empire
but
where
indeed
she
loved
and
doted
as
now
in
this
humour
put
her
on
the
rack
at
every
thought
or
fancy
that
he
might
break
his
chains
and
having
laid
the
last
obligation
upon
him
she
expected
him
to
be
her
slave
for
ever
and
treated
him
with
all
the
haughty
tyranny
of
her
sex
in
all
those
moments
when
softness
was
not
predominant
in
her
soul
she
was
chagrin
at
every
thing
if
but
displeased
with
one
thing
and
while
she
gave
torments
to
others
she
failed
not
to
feel
them
the
most
sensibly
herself
so
that
still
searching
for
new
occasion
of
quarrel
with
she
drew
on
herself
most
intolerable
pains
such
as
doubting
lovers
feel
after
long
hopes
and
confirmed
joy
she
reads
and
weeps
and
when
she
came
to
that
part
of
it
that
inquired
of
the
health
and
being
of
the
pledge
of
love
she
grew
so
tender
that
she
was
almost
fainting
in
her
chair
but
recovering
from
the
soft
reflection
and
finding
she
had
said
nothing
of
it
already
she
took
her
pen
again
and
writ
you
ask
me
oh
charming
how
the
pledge
of
our
soft
hours
thrives
alas
as
if
it
meant
to
brave
the
worst
of
fate
it
does
advance
my
sorrows
and
all
your
cruelties
have
not
destroyed
that
but
i
still
bear
about
me
the
destiny
of
many
a
sighing
maid
that
this
who
will
i
am
sure
be
like
will
ruin
with
his
looks
thou
sacred
treasure
of
my
soul
forgive
me
if
i
have
wronged
thy
love
she
made
an
end
of
writing
this
just
when
arrived
and
told
her
was
alighted
at
the
gate
and
coming
to
visit
her
which
gave
her
occasion
to
say
this
of
him
to
i
think
i
had
not
ended
here
but
that
the
bravest
and
the
best
of
friends
is
come
to
visit
me
the
only
satisfaction
i
have
to
support
my
life
in
absence
pay
him
those
thanks
that
are
due
to
him
from
me
pay
him
for
all
the
generous
cares
he
has
taken
of
me
beyond
a
friend
almost
in
his
blooming
passion
when
it
was
all
new
and
young
and
full
of
duty
could
not
have
rendered
me
his
service
with
a
more
awful
industry
sure
he
was
made
for
love
and
glorious
friendship
cherish
him
then
preserve
him
next
your
soul
for
he
is
a
jewel
fit
for
such
a
cabinet
his
form
his
parts
and
every
noble
action
shews
us
the
royal
race
from
whence
he
sprung
and
the
victorious
confesses
him
his
own
in
every
virtue
and
in
every
grace
nor
can
the
illegitimacy
eclipse
him
sure
he
was
got
in
the
first
heat
of
love
which
formed
him
so
a
but
no
more
is
as
kind
a
judge
as
sylvia
she
had
no
sooner
finished
this
and
sealed
it
but
came
into
the
chamber
and
with
such
an
air
with
such
a
grace
and
mien
he
approached
her
with
all
the
languishment
of
soft
trembling
love
in
his
face
which
with
the
addition
of
the
dress
he
was
that
day
in
which
was
extremely
rich
and
advantageous
and
altogether
such
as
pleases
the
vanity
of
women
i
have
since
heard
the
charming
say
in
spite
of
her
tenderness
for
she
found
a
soft
emotion
in
her
soul
a
kind
of
pleasure
at
his
approach
which
made
her
blush
with
some
kind
of
anger
at
her
own
easiness
nor
could
she
have
blushed
in
a
more
happy
season
for
saw
it
and
it
served
at
once
to
add
a
lustre
to
her
paler
beauty
and
to
betray
some
little
kind
sentiment
which
possessed
him
with
a
joy
that
had
the
same
effects
on
him
saw
it
and
the
care
she
took
to
hide
her
own
served
but
to
increase
her
blushes
which
put
her
into
a
confusion
she
had
much
ado
to
reclaim
she
cast
her
eyes
to
earth
and
leaning
her
cheek
on
her
hand
she
continued
on
her
seat
without
paying
him
that
usual
ceremony
she
was
wont
to
do
while
he
stood
speechless
for
a
moment
gazing
on
her
with
infinite
satisfaction
when
she
to
assume
a
formality
as
well
as
she
could
rose
up
and
cried
fearing
he
had
seen
too
much
i
have
been
considering
after
what
manner
i
ought
to
receive
you
and
while
i
was
so
i
left
those
civilities
unpaid
which
your
quality
and
my
good
manners
ought
to
have
rendered
ah
madam
replied
he
sighing
you
would
receive
me
as
i
merited
and
you
ought
at
least
you
would
receive
me
as
the
most
passionate
lover
that
ever
adored
was
rather
believing
said
that
i
ought
to
have
received
you
as
my
foe
since
you
conceal
from
me
so
long
what
you
can
not
but
believe
i
am
extremely
impatient
of
hearing
and
what
so
nearly
concerns
my
at
this
he
only
answering
with
a
sigh
she
pursued
sure
you
understand
me
answer
to
the
letter
of
your
confessing
passion
has
not
so
long
been
the
subject
of
our
discourse
and
expectation
but
you
guess
at
what
i
mean
who
on
all
occasions
wanted
not
wit
or
reply
was
here
at
a
loss
what
to
answer
notwithstanding
he
had
considered
before
what
he
would
say
but
let
those
in
love
fancy
and
make
what
fine
speeches
they
please
and
believe
themselves
furnished
with
abundance
of
eloquent
harangues
at
the
sight
of
the
dear
object
they
lose
them
all
and
love
teaches
them
a
dialect
much
more
prevailing
without
the
expense
of
duller
thought
and
they
leave
unsaid
all
they
had
so
floridly
formed
before
a
sigh
a
thousand
things
with
more
success
love
like
poetry
can
not
be
taught
but
uninstructed
flows
without
painful
study
if
it
be
true
it
is
born
in
the
soul
a
noble
inspiration
not
a
science
such
was
he
thought
it
dishonourable
to
be
guilty
of
the
meanness
of
a
lie
and
say
he
had
no
answer
he
thought
it
rude
to
say
he
had
one
and
would
not
shew
it
and
he
believed
it
the
height
of
ungenerous
baseness
to
shew
it
while
he
remained
this
moment
silent
whose
love
jealousy
and
impatience
endured
no
delay
with
a
malicious
half
smile
and
a
tone
all
angry
scorn
in
her
eyes
and
passion
on
her
tongue
she
cried
it
is
well
that
you
so
early
let
me
know
you
can
be
false
unjust
and
faithless
you
knew
your
power
and
in
pity
to
that
youth
and
easiness
you
found
in
me
have
given
a
civil
warning
to
my
heart
in
this
i
must
confess
continued
she
have
given
a
much
greater
testimony
of
your
friendship
for
than
your
passion
for
and
i
suppose
you
came
not
here
to
resolve
yourself
which
you
should
prefer
that
was
decided
ere
you
arrived
and
this
visit
i
imagine
was
only
to
put
me
out
of
doubt
a
piece
of
charity
you
might
have
she
ended
this
with
a
scorn
that
had
a
thousand
charms
because
it
gave
him
a
little
hope
and
he
answered
with
a
sigh
ah
madam
how
very
easy
you
find
it
to
entertain
thoughts
disadvantageous
of
me
and
how
small
a
fault
your
wit
and
cruelty
can
improve
to
a
crime
you
are
not
offended
at
my
friendship
for
i
know
you
do
not
value
my
life
and
my
repose
so
much
as
to
be
concerned
who
or
what
shares
this
heart
that
adores
you
no
it
has
not
merited
that
glory
nor
dare
i
presume
to
hope
you
should
so
much
as
wish
my
passion
for
should
surmount
my
friendship
to
if
i
did
replied
she
with
a
scorn
i
perceive
i
might
wish
in
madam
answered
he
i
have
too
divine
an
opinion
of
the
justice
of
the
charming
to
believe
i
ought
or
could
make
my
approaches
to
her
heart
by
ways
so
base
and
ungenerous
the
result
of
even
tolerated
treason
is
to
hate
the
oh
you
are
very
nice
replied
your
punctilio
to
but
i
perceive
you
are
not
so
tender
in
those
you
ought
to
have
for
i
find
honour
in
you
men
is
only
what
you
please
to
make
it
for
at
the
same
time
you
think
it
ungenerous
to
betray
you
believe
it
no
breach
of
honour
to
betray
the
eternal
repose
of
you
have
promised
your
friendship
you
have
avowed
yourself
my
lover
my
slave
my
friend
my
every
thing
and
yet
not
one
of
these
has
any
tie
to
oblige
you
to
my
interest
pray
tell
me
continued
she
when
you
last
writ
to
him
was
it
not
in
order
to
receive
an
answer
from
him
and
was
not
i
to
see
that
answer
and
here
you
think
it
no
dishonour
to
break
your
word
or
promise
by
which
i
find
your
false
notions
of
virtue
and
honour
with
which
you
serve
yourselves
when
interest
design
or
makes
you
think
it
madam
replied
you
are
pleased
to
pursue
your
anger
as
if
indeed
i
had
disobeyed
your
command
or
refused
to
shew
you
what
you
imagine
i
have
from
yes
i
do
replied
she
hastily
and
wonder
why
you
should
have
a
greater
friendship
for
than
for
especially
if
it
be
true
that
you
say
you
have
joined
love
to
friendship
or
are
you
of
the
opinion
of
those
that
cry
they
can
not
be
a
lover
and
a
friend
of
the
same
ah
madam
cried
our
perplexed
lover
i
beg
you
to
believe
i
think
it
so
much
more
my
duty
and
inclination
to
serve
and
obey
than
i
do
that
i
swear
to
you
oh
charming
conqueress
of
my
soul
if
have
betrayed
he
has
at
the
same
time
betrayed
and
that
i
would
revenge
it
with
the
loss
of
my
life
in
injuring
the
adorable
believe
me
lovely
maid
he
injures
so
much
more
than
a
friend
as
honour
is
above
the
inclinations
if
he
wrong
you
by
heaven
he
cancels
all
he
wrongs
my
soul
my
honour
mistress
and
my
sister
fearing
he
had
said
too
much
he
stopped
and
sighed
at
the
word
sister
and
casting
down
his
eyes
blushing
with
shame
and
anger
he
continued
oh
give
me
leave
to
say
a
sister
madam
lest
mistress
had
been
too
daring
and
presumptuous
and
a
title
that
would
not
justify
my
quarrel
half
so
well
since
it
would
take
the
honour
from
my
just
resentment
and
blast
it
with
the
scandal
of
or
jealous
what
you
say
replied
she
deserves
abundance
of
acknowledgement
but
if
you
would
have
me
believe
you
you
ought
to
hide
nothing
from
me
and
he
methinks
that
was
so
daring
to
confess
his
passion
to
may
after
that
venture
on
any
discovery
in
short
i
demand
to
see
the
return
you
have
from
for
possibly
said
she
sweetening
her
charming
face
into
a
smile
designed
i
should
not
be
displeased
to
find
i
might
with
more
freedom
receive
your
addresses
and
on
the
coldness
of
reasoning
may
depend
a
great
part
of
your
fate
or
fortune
come
come
produce
your
credentials
they
may
recommend
your
heart
more
effectually
than
all
the
fine
things
you
can
say
you
know
how
the
least
appearance
of
a
slight
from
a
lover
may
advance
the
pride
of
a
mistress
and
pride
in
this
affair
will
be
your
best
thus
she
insinuated
with
all
her
female
arts
and
put
on
all
her
charms
of
looks
and
smiles
sweetened
her
mouth
softened
her
voice
and
eyes
assuming
all
the
tenderness
and
little
affectations
her
subtle
sex
was
capable
of
while
he
lay
all
ravished
and
almost
expiring
at
her
feet
sometimes
transported
with
imagined
joys
in
the
possession
of
the
dear
flattering
charmer
he
was
ready
to
unravel
all
the
secrets
of
letter
but
honour
yet
was
even
above
his
passion
and
made
him
blush
at
his
first
hasty
thought
and
now
he
strove
to
put
her
off
with
all
the
art
he
could
who
had
so
very
little
in
his
nature
and
whose
real
love
and
perfect
honour
had
set
him
above
the
little
evasions
of
truth
who
scorned
in
all
other
cases
the
baseness
and
cowardice
of
a
lie
and
so
unsuccessful
now
was
the
little
honest
cheat
which
he
knew
not
how
to
manage
well
that
it
was
soon
discovered
to
the
witty
jealous
and
angry
so
that
after
all
the
rage
a
passionate
woman
could
express
who
believed
herself
injured
by
the
only
two
persons
in
the
world
from
whom
she
expected
most
adoration
she
had
recourse
to
that
natural
and
softening
aid
of
her
sex
her
tears
and
having
already
reproached
with
all
the
malice
of
a
defeated
woman
she
now
continued
it
in
so
moving
a
manner
that
our
could
no
longer
remain
unconquered
by
that
powerful
way
of
charming
but
unfixed
to
all
he
had
resolved
gave
up
at
least
a
part
of
the
secret
and
owned
he
had
a
letter
from
and
after
this
confession
knowing
very
well
he
could
not
keep
her
from
the
sight
of
it
no
though
an
empire
were
rendered
her
to
buy
it
off
his
wit
was
next
employed
how
he
should
defend
the
sense
of
it
that
she
might
not
think
false
in
order
to
this
he
forcing
a
smile
told
her
that
was
the
most
malicious
of
his
sex
and
had
contrived
the
best
stratagem
in
the
world
to
find
whether
still
loved
or
retained
his
friendship
for
him
and
but
that
continued
he
i
know
the
nature
of
your
curious
sex
to
be
such
that
if
i
should
persuade
you
not
to
see
it
it
would
but
the
more
inflame
your
desire
of
seeing
it
i
would
ask
no
more
of
the
charming
than
that
she
would
not
oblige
me
to
shew
what
would
turn
so
greatly
to
my
own
advantage
if
i
were
not
too
sensible
it
is
but
to
entrap
me
that
has
taken
this
method
in
his
answer
believe
me
adorable
i
plead
against
my
own
life
while
i
beg
you
not
to
put
my
honour
to
the
test
by
commanding
me
to
shew
this
letter
and
that
i
join
against
the
interest
of
my
own
eternal
repose
while
i
plead
she
hears
him
with
a
hundred
changes
of
countenance
love
rage
and
jealousy
swell
in
her
fierce
eyes
her
breath
beats
short
and
she
was
ready
to
burst
into
speaking
before
he
had
finished
what
he
had
to
say
she
called
up
all
the
little
discretion
and
reason
love
had
left
her
to
manage
herself
as
she
ought
in
this
great
occasion
she
bit
her
lips
and
swallowed
her
rising
sighs
but
he
soon
saw
the
storm
he
had
raised
and
knew
not
how
to
stand
the
shock
of
its
fury
he
sighs
he
pleads
in
vain
and
the
more
he
endeavours
to
excuse
the
levity
of
the
more
he
rends
her
heart
and
sets
her
on
the
rack
and
concluding
him
false
she
could
no
longer
contain
her
rage
but
broke
out
into
all
the
fury
that
madness
can
inspire
and
from
one
degree
to
another
wrought
her
passion
to
the
height
of
lunacy
she
tore
her
hair
and
bit
his
hands
that
endeavoured
to
restrain
hers
from
violence
she
rent
the
ornaments
from
her
fair
body
and
discovered
a
thousand
charms
and
beauties
and
finding
now
that
both
his
strength
and
reason
were
too
weak
to
prevent
the
mischiefs
he
found
he
had
brought
on
her
he
calls
for
help
when
was
but
too
ready
at
hand
with
and
some
others
who
came
to
his
assistance
who
knew
nothing
of
the
occasion
of
all
this
believed
it
the
second
part
of
his
own
late
adventure
and
fancied
that
had
used
some
violence
to
her
upon
this
he
assumes
the
authority
of
his
lord
and
secretly
that
of
a
husband
or
lover
and
upbraiding
the
innocent
with
his
brutality
they
fell
to
such
words
as
ended
in
a
challenge
the
next
morning
for
appeared
a
gentleman
companion
to
his
lord
and
one
whom
could
not
well
refuse
this
was
not
carried
so
silently
but
busy
as
she
was
about
her
raving
lady
heard
the
appointment
and
quitted
the
chamber
almost
as
much
disturbed
as
whom
with
much
ado
they
persuaded
him
to
leave
but
before
he
did
so
he
on
his
knees
offered
her
the
letter
and
implored
her
to
receive
it
so
absolutely
his
love
had
vanquished
his
nobler
part
that
of
honour
but
she
attending
no
motions
but
those
of
her
own
rage
had
no
regard
either
to
proffer
or
his
arguments
of
excuse
so
that
he
went
away
with
the
letter
in
all
the
extremity
of
disorder
this
last
part
of
his
submission
was
not
seen
by
who
immediately
left
the
chamber
upon
receiving
answer
to
his
challenge
so
that
was
now
left
with
her
woman
only
who
by
degrees
brought
her
to
more
calmness
and
impatient
to
hear
the
reproaches
he
hoped
she
would
give
when
she
was
returned
to
reason
being
curious
of
any
thing
that
might
redound
to
his
disadvantage
whom
he
took
to
be
a
powerful
rival
returned
again
into
her
chamber
but
in
lieu
of
hearing
what
he
wished
being
recovered
from
her
passion
of
madness
and
her
soul
in
a
state
of
thinking
a
little
with
reason
she
misses
in
the
crowd
and
with
a
voice
her
rage
had
enfeebled
to
a
languishment
she
cried
surveying
carefully
those
about
her
oh
where
is
where
is
that
angel
man
he
who
of
all
his
kind
can
give
me
comfort
replied
he
is
gone
while
he
was
here
he
kneeled
and
prayed
in
vain
but
for
a
word
or
look
his
tears
are
yet
remaining
wet
upon
your
feet
and
all
for
one
sensible
reply
but
rage
had
deafened
you
what
has
he
done
to
merit
this
oh
cried
it
was
what
he
would
not
do
that
makes
me
rave
run
haste
and
fetch
him
back
but
let
him
leave
his
honour
all
behind
tell
him
he
has
too
much
consideration
for
and
none
for
my
repose
oh
have
i
no
friend
in
view
dares
carry
a
message
from
me
to
bid
him
return
oh
instantly
return
i
die
i
languish
for
a
sight
of
him
descending
angels
would
not
be
so
welcome
why
stand
ye
still
have
i
no
power
with
you
will
none
obey
then
running
hastily
to
the
chamber
door
she
called
her
page
to
whom
she
cried
haste
haste
dear
youth
and
find
out
and
bring
him
to
me
instantly
tell
him
i
die
to
see
the
boy
glad
of
so
kind
a
message
to
so
liberal
a
lover
runs
on
his
errand
while
she
returns
to
her
chamber
and
endeavours
to
recollect
her
senses
against
coming
as
much
as
possibly
she
could
she
dismisses
her
attendant
with
different
apprehensions
sometimes
believed
this
was
the
second
part
of
her
first
raving
and
having
never
seen
her
thus
but
for
concludes
it
the
height
of
tenderness
and
passion
for
but
because
she
made
so
public
a
declaration
of
it
he
believed
he
had
given
her
a
philtre
which
had
raised
her
flame
so
much
above
the
bounds
of
modesty
and
discretion
concluding
it
so
he
knew
the
usual
effects
of
things
of
that
nature
and
that
nothing
could
allay
the
heat
of
such
a
love
but
possession
and
easily
deluded
with
every
fancy
that
flattered
his
love
mad
by
any
way
to
obtain
the
last
blessing
with
he
consults
with
how
to
get
one
of
letters
out
of
her
lady
s
cabinet
and
feigning
many
frivolous
reasons
which
deluded
the
amorous
maid
he
persuaded
her
to
get
him
one
which
she
did
in
half
an
hour
after
for
by
this
time
being
in
as
much
tranquillity
as
it
was
possible
a
lover
could
be
in
who
had
the
hopes
of
knowing
all
the
secrets
of
the
false
betrayer
she
had
called
to
dress
her
which
she
resolved
should
be
in
all
the
careless
magnificence
that
art
or
nature
could
put
on
to
charm
wholly
to
obedience
whom
she
had
sent
for
and
whom
she
expected
but
she
was
no
sooner
set
to
her
toilet
but
page
arrived
with
a
letter
from
his
master
which
she
greedily
snatched
and
read
this
octavio
sylvia
by
this
time
oh
charming
give
me
leave
to
hope
your
rage
is
abated
and
your
reason
returned
and
that
you
will
hear
a
little
from
the
most
unfortunate
of
men
whom
you
have
reduced
to
this
miserable
extremity
of
losing
either
the
adorable
object
of
his
soul
or
his
honour
if
you
can
prefer
a
little
curiosity
that
will
serve
but
to
afflict
you
before
either
that
or
my
repose
what
esteem
ought
i
to
believe
you
have
for
the
unfortunate
and
if
you
hate
me
as
it
is
evident
if
you
compel
me
to
the
extremity
of
losing
my
repose
or
honour
what
reason
or
argument
have
i
to
prefer
so
careless
a
fair
one
above
the
last
it
is
certain
you
neither
do
nor
can
love
me
now
and
how
much
below
that
hope
shall
the
exposed
and
abandoned
be
when
he
shall
pretend
to
that
glory
without
his
honour
believe
me
charming
maid
i
would
sacrifice
my
life
and
my
entire
fortune
at
your
least
command
to
serve
you
but
to
render
you
a
devoir
that
must
point
me
out
the
basest
of
my
sex
is
what
my
temper
must
resist
in
spite
of
all
the
violence
of
my
love
and
i
thank
my
happier
stars
that
they
have
given
me
resolution
enough
rather
to
fall
a
sacrifice
to
the
last
than
be
guilty
of
the
breach
of
the
first
this
is
the
last
and
present
thought
and
pleasure
of
my
soul
and
lest
it
should
by
the
force
of
those
divine
ideas
which
eternally
surround
it
be
soothed
and
flattered
from
its
noble
principles
i
will
put
myself
out
of
the
hazard
of
temptation
and
divert
if
possible
by
absence
to
the
campaign
those
soft
importunate
betrayers
of
my
liberty
that
perpetually
solicit
in
favour
of
you
i
dare
not
so
much
as
bid
you
adieu
one
sight
of
that
bright
angel
s
face
would
undo
me
unfix
my
nobler
resolution
and
leave
me
a
despicable
slave
sighing
my
unrewarded
treason
at
your
insensible
feet
my
fortune
i
leave
to
be
disposed
by
you
but
the
more
useless
necessary
i
will
for
ever
take
from
those
lovely
eyes
you
can
look
on
nothing
with
joy
but
the
happy
if
i
have
denied
you
one
satisfaction
at
least
i
have
given
you
this
other
of
securing
you
eternally
from
the
trouble
and
importunity
of
madam
your
faithful
octavio
this
letter
to
any
other
less
secure
of
her
power
than
was
our
fair
subject
would
have
made
them
impatient
and
angry
but
she
found
that
there
was
something
yet
in
her
power
the
dispensation
of
which
could
soon
recall
him
from
any
resolution
he
was
able
to
make
of
absenting
himself
her
glass
stood
before
her
and
every
glance
that
way
was
an
assurance
and
security
to
her
heart
she
could
not
see
that
beauty
and
doubt
its
power
of
persuasion
she
therefore
took
her
pen
and
writ
him
this
answer
being
in
a
moment
furnished
with
all
the
art
and
subtlety
that
was
necessary
on
this
occasion
sylvia
octavio
though
i
have
not
beauty
enough
to
command
your
heart
at
least
allow
me
sense
enough
to
oblige
your
belief
that
i
fancy
and
resent
all
that
the
letter
contains
which
you
have
denied
me
and
that
i
am
not
of
that
sort
of
women
whose
want
of
youth
or
beauty
renders
so
constant
to
pursue
the
ghost
of
a
departed
love
it
is
enough
to
justify
my
honour
that
i
was
not
the
first
aggressor
i
find
myself
pursued
by
too
many
charms
of
wit
youth
and
gallantry
to
bury
myself
beneath
the
willows
or
to
whine
away
my
youth
by
murmuring
rivers
or
betake
me
to
the
last
refuge
of
a
declining
beauty
a
monastery
no
my
lord
when
i
have
revenged
and
recompensed
myself
for
the
injuries
of
one
inconstant
with
the
joys
a
thousand
imploring
lovers
offer
it
will
be
time
to
be
weary
of
a
world
which
yet
every
day
presents
me
new
joys
and
i
swear
to
you
that
it
was
more
to
recompense
what
i
owed
your
passion
that
i
desired
a
convincing
proof
of
falsehood
than
for
any
other
reason
and
you
have
too
much
wit
not
to
know
it
for
what
other
use
could
i
make
of
the
secret
if
he
be
false
he
is
gone
unworthy
of
me
and
impossible
to
be
retrieved
and
i
would
as
soon
dye
my
sullied
garments
and
wear
them
over
again
as
take
to
my
embraces
a
reformed
lover
the
native
first
lustre
of
whose
passion
is
quite
extinct
and
is
no
more
the
same
no
my
lord
she
must
be
poor
in
beauty
that
has
recourse
to
shifts
so
mean
if
i
would
know
the
secret
by
all
that
is
good
it
were
to
hate
him
heartily
and
to
dispose
of
my
person
to
the
best
advantage
which
in
honour
i
can
not
do
while
i
am
unconvinced
of
the
falseness
of
him
with
whom
i
exchanged
a
thousand
vows
of
fidelity
but
if
he
unlink
the
chain
i
am
at
perfect
liberty
and
why
by
this
delay
you
should
make
me
lose
my
time
i
am
not
able
to
conceive
unless
you
fear
i
should
then
take
you
at
your
word
and
expect
the
performance
of
all
the
vows
of
love
you
have
made
me
if
that
be
it
my
pride
shall
be
your
security
or
if
other
recompense
you
expect
set
the
price
upon
your
secret
and
see
at
what
rate
i
shall
purchase
the
liberty
it
will
procure
me
possibly
it
may
be
such
as
may
at
once
enfranchise
me
and
revenge
me
on
the
perjured
ingrate
than
which
nothing
can
be
a
greater
satisfaction
to
sylvia
she
seals
this
letter
with
a
wafer
and
giving
it
to
to
give
the
page
believing
she
had
writ
what
would
not
be
in
vain
to
the
takes
both
that
and
the
other
which
had
sent
and
left
her
lady
busy
in
dressing
her
head
and
went
to
chamber
who
thought
every
moment
an
age
till
she
came
so
vigorous
he
was
on
his
new
design
that
which
was
sent
to
being
sealed
with
a
wet
wafer
he
neatly
opens
as
it
was
easy
to
do
and
read
and
sealed
again
and
delivered
it
to
the
page
after
receiving
what
pay
could
force
himself
to
bestow
upon
her
some
flatteries
of
dissembled
love
and
some
cold
kisses
which
even
imagination
could
not
render
better
she
returned
to
her
lady
and
he
to
his
stratagem
which
was
to
counterfeit
a
letter
from
she
having
in
hers
given
him
a
hint
by
bidding
him
set
a
price
upon
the
secret
which
he
had
heard
was
that
of
a
letter
from
with
all
the
circumstances
of
it
from
the
faithless
whom
love
had
betrayed
and
after
blotting
much
paper
to
try
every
letter
through
the
alphabet
and
to
produce
them
like
those
of
which
was
not
hard
for
a
lover
of
ingenuity
he
fell
to
the
business
of
what
he
would
write
and
having
finished
it
to
his
liking
his
next
trouble
was
how
to
convey
it
to
her
for
always
sent
his
by
his
page
whom
he
could
trust
he
now
was
certain
of
love
between
them
for
though
he
often
had
persuaded
to
bring
him
letters
yet
she
could
not
be
wrought
on
till
now
to
betray
her
trust
and
what
he
long
apprehended
he
found
too
true
on
both
sides
and
now
he
waited
but
for
an
opportunity
to
send
it
seasonably
and
in
a
lucky
minute
in
the
mean
time
adorns
herself
for
an
absolute
conquest
and
disposing
herself
in
the
most
charming
careless
and
tempting
manner
she
could
devise
she
lay
expecting
her
coming
lover
on
a
repose
of
rich
embroidery
of
gold
on
blue
satin
hung
with
little
amorous
pictures
of
descending
in
her
chariot
naked
to
she
embracing
while
the
youth
more
eager
of
his
rural
sports
turns
half
from
her
in
a
posture
of
pursuing
his
dogs
who
are
on
their
chase
another
of
who
is
dressing
the
sleeping
warrior
up
in
wreaths
of
flowers
while
a
hundred
little
loves
are
playing
with
his
gilded
armour
this
puts
on
his
helmet
too
big
for
his
little
head
that
hides
his
whole
face
another
makes
a
of
his
sword
and
lance
another
fits
on
his
while
three
or
four
little
are
seeming
to
heave
and
help
him
to
hold
it
an
end
and
all
turned
the
emblems
of
the
hero
into
ridicule
these
and
some
either
of
the
like
nature
adorned
the
pavilion
of
the
languishing
fair
one
who
lay
carelessly
on
her
side
her
arm
leaning
on
little
pillows
of
point
of
and
a
book
of
amours
in
her
other
hand
every
noise
alarmed
her
with
trembling
hope
that
her
lover
was
come
and
i
have
heard
she
said
she
verily
believed
that
acting
and
feigning
the
lover
possessed
her
with
a
tenderness
against
her
knowledge
and
will
and
she
found
something
more
in
her
soul
than
a
bare
curiosity
of
seeing
for
the
letter
s
sake
but
in
lieu
of
her
lover
she
found
herself
once
more
approached
with
a
billet
from
him
which
brought
this
octavio
sylvia
ah
he
must
be
more
than
human
that
can
withstand
your
charms
i
confess
my
frailty
and
fall
before
you
the
weakest
of
my
sex
and
own
i
am
ready
to
believe
all
your
dear
letter
contains
and
have
vanity
enough
to
wrest
every
hopeful
word
to
my
own
interest
and
in
favour
of
my
own
heart
what
will
become
of
me
if
my
easy
faith
should
only
flatter
me
and
i
with
shame
should
find
it
was
not
meant
to
me
or
if
it
were
it
was
only
to
draw
me
from
a
virtue
which
has
been
hitherto
the
pride
and
beauty
of
my
youth
the
glory
of
my
name
and
my
comfort
and
refuge
in
all
extremes
of
fortune
the
eternal
companion
guide
and
counsellor
of
all
my
actions
yet
this
good
you
only
have
power
to
rob
me
of
and
leave
me
exposed
to
the
scorn
of
all
the
laughing
world
yet
give
me
love
give
me
but
hope
in
lieu
of
it
and
i
am
content
to
divest
myself
of
all
besides
perhaps
you
will
say
i
ask
too
mighty
a
rate
for
so
poor
a
secret
but
even
in
that
there
lies
one
of
my
own
that
will
more
expose
the
feebleness
of
my
blood
and
name
than
the
discovery
will
me
in
particular
so
that
i
know
not
what
i
do
when
i
give
you
up
the
knowledge
you
desire
still
you
will
say
all
this
is
to
enhance
its
value
and
raise
the
price
and
oh
i
fear
you
have
taught
my
soul
every
quality
it
fears
and
dreads
in
yours
and
learnt
it
to
chaffer
for
every
thought
if
i
could
fix
upon
the
rate
to
sell
it
at
and
i
with
shame
confess
i
would
be
mercenary
could
we
but
agree
upon
the
price
but
my
respect
forbids
me
all
things
but
silent
hope
and
that
in
spite
of
me
and
all
my
reason
will
predominate
for
the
rest
i
will
wholly
resign
myself
and
all
the
faculties
of
my
soul
to
the
charming
arbitrator
of
my
peace
the
powerful
judge
of
love
the
adorable
and
at
her
feet
render
all
she
demands
yes
she
shall
find
me
there
to
justify
all
the
weakness
this
proclaims
for
i
confess
oh
too
too
powerful
maid
that
you
have
absolutely
subdued
octavio
she
had
no
sooner
read
this
letter
but
instead
of
laying
it
by
carried
it
to
and
departed
the
chamber
to
make
way
for
who
she
imagined
was
coming
to
make
his
visit
and
left
considering
how
she
should
manage
him
to
the
best
advantage
and
with
most
honour
acquit
herself
of
what
she
had
made
him
hope
but
instead
of
his
coming
to
wait
on
her
an
unexpected
accident
arrived
to
prevent
him
for
a
messenger
from
the
prince
came
with
commands
that
he
should
forthwith
come
to
his
highness
the
messenger
having
command
to
bring
him
along
with
him
so
that
not
able
to
disobey
he
only
begged
time
to
write
a
note
of
business
which
was
a
billet
to
to
excuse
himself
till
the
next
day
for
it
being
five
leagues
to
the
village
where
the
prince
waited
his
coming
he
could
not
return
that
night
which
was
the
business
of
the
note
with
which
his
page
hasted
to
who
was
now
a
vigilant
lover
and
waiting
for
every
opportunity
that
might
favour
his
design
saw
the
page
arrive
with
the
note
and
as
it
was
usual
he
took
it
to
carry
to
his
conqueress
but
meeting
on
the
stairs
he
gave
her
what
he
had
before
counterfeited
with
such
art
after
he
had
opened
what
had
sent
and
found
fortune
was
wholly
on
his
side
he
having
learned
from
the
page
besides
that
his
lord
had
taken
coach
with
monsieur
to
go
to
his
highness
and
would
not
return
that
night
not
knowing
the
deceit
carried
her
lady
the
forged
letter
who
opened
it
with
eager
haste
and
read
this
the
sylvia
since
i
have
a
secret
which
none
but
i
can
unfold
and
that
you
have
offered
at
any
rate
to
buy
it
of
me
give
me
leave
to
say
that
you
fair
creature
have
another
secret
a
joy
to
dispense
which
none
but
you
can
give
the
languishing
if
you
dare
purchase
this
of
mine
with
that
infinitely
more
valuable
one
of
yours
i
will
be
as
secret
as
death
and
think
myself
happier
than
a
fancied
god
take
what
methods
you
please
for
the
payment
and
what
time
order
me
command
me
conjure
me
i
will
wait
watch
and
pay
my
duty
at
all
hours
to
snatch
the
most
convenient
one
to
reap
so
ravishing
a
blessing
i
know
you
will
accuse
me
with
all
the
confidence
and
rudeness
in
the
world
but
oh
consider
lovely
that
that
passion
which
could
change
my
soul
from
all
the
course
of
honour
has
power
to
make
me
forget
that
nice
respect
your
beauty
awes
me
with
and
my
passion
is
now
arrived
at
such
a
height
it
obeys
no
laws
but
its
own
and
i
am
obstinately
bent
on
the
pursuit
of
that
vast
pleasure
i
fancy
to
find
in
the
dear
the
ravishing
arms
of
the
adorable
impatient
of
your
answer
i
am
as
love
compels
me
madam
your
slave
octavio
the
page
who
waited
no
answer
was
departed
but
who
believed
he
attended
was
in
a
thousand
minds
what
to
say
or
do
she
blushed
as
she
read
and
then
looked
pale
with
anger
and
disdain
and
but
that
she
had
already
given
her
honour
up
it
would
have
been
something
more
surprising
but
she
was
used
to
questions
of
that
nature
and
therefore
received
this
with
so
much
the
less
concern
nevertheless
it
was
sufficient
to
fill
her
soul
with
a
thousand
agitations
but
when
she
would
be
angry
the
consideration
of
what
she
had
writ
to
him
to
encourage
him
to
this
boldness
stopped
her
rage
when
she
would
take
it
ill
she
considered
his
knowledge
of
her
lost
fame
and
that
took
off
a
great
part
of
her
resentment
on
that
side
and
in
midst
of
all
she
was
raving
for
the
knowledge
of
secret
she
rose
from
the
bed
and
walked
about
the
room
in
much
disorder
full
of
thought
and
no
conclusion
she
is
ashamed
to
consult
of
this
affair
with
and
knows
not
what
to
fix
on
the
only
thing
she
was
certain
of
and
which
was
fully
and
undisputably
resolved
in
her
soul
was
never
to
consent
to
so
false
an
action
never
to
buy
the
secret
at
so
dear
a
rate
she
abhors
whom
she
regards
no
more
as
that
fine
thing
which
before
she
thought
him
and
a
thousand
times
she
was
about
to
write
her
despite
and
contempt
but
still
the
dear
secret
stayed
her
hand
and
she
was
fond
of
the
torment
at
last
who
was
afflicted
to
know
the
cause
of
this
disorder
asked
her
lady
if
would
not
come
no
replied
blushing
at
the
name
nor
never
shall
the
ungrateful
man
dare
to
behold
my
face
any
jesu
replied
what
has
he
done
madam
to
deserve
this
severity
for
he
was
a
great
benefactor
to
and
had
already
by
his
gifts
and
presents
made
her
a
fortune
for
a
burgomaster
he
has
said
committed
such
an
impudence
as
deserves
death
from
my
hand
this
she
spoke
in
rage
and
walked
away
cross
the
chamber
madam
cried
he
deny
to
give
you
the
letter
replied
but
asks
me
such
a
price
for
it
as
makes
me
hate
myself
that
am
reduced
by
my
ill
conduct
to
addresses
of
that
nature
heavens
madam
what
can
he
ask
you
to
afflict
you
so
the
presumptuous
man
said
she
in
rage
has
the
impudence
to
ask
what
never
man
but
was
ever
possessed
of
at
this
laughed
good
lord
madam
said
she
and
are
you
angry
at
such
desires
in
men
towards
you
i
believe
you
are
the
first
lady
in
the
world
that
was
ever
offended
for
being
desirable
can
any
thing
proclaim
your
beauty
more
or
your
youth
or
wit
marry
madam
i
wish
i
were
worthy
to
be
asked
the
question
by
all
the
fine
dancing
dressing
fops
in
and
you
would
yield
replied
not
so
neither
replied
but
i
would
spark
myself
and
value
myself
the
more
upon
oh
said
she
that
is
so
fond
of
hearing
of
love
no
doubt
but
will
find
some
one
to
practise
it
that
is
as
i
should
find
myself
inclined
replied
was
not
so
intent
on
raillery
but
she
employed
all
her
thought
the
while
on
what
she
had
to
do
and
those
last
words
of
jogged
a
thought
that
ran
on
to
one
very
advantageous
at
least
her
present
and
first
apprehension
of
it
was
such
and
she
turned
to
with
a
face
more
gay
than
it
was
the
last
minute
and
cried
prithee
good
wench
tell
me
what
sort
of
man
would
soonest
incline
you
to
a
yielding
if
you
command
me
madam
to
be
free
with
your
ladyship
replied
i
must
confess
there
are
two
sorts
of
men
that
would
most
villainously
incline
me
the
first
is
he
that
would
make
my
fortune
best
the
next
he
that
would
make
my
pleasure
the
young
the
handsome
or
rather
the
and
but
above
all
the
man
of
but
what
would
you
say
replied
if
all
these
made
up
in
one
man
should
make
his
addresses
to
you
why
then
most
certainly
madam
replied
i
should
yield
him
my
honour
after
a
reasonable
this
though
the
wanton
young
maid
spoke
possibly
at
first
more
to
put
her
lady
in
good
humour
than
from
any
inclination
she
had
to
what
she
said
yet
after
many
arguments
upon
that
subject
cunning
enough
to
pursue
her
design
brought
the
business
more
home
and
told
her
in
plain
terms
that
was
the
man
who
had
been
so
presumptuous
as
to
ask
so
great
a
reward
as
the
possession
of
herself
for
the
secret
she
desired
and
after
a
thousand
little
subtleties
having
made
the
forward
girl
confess
with
blushes
she
was
not
a
maid
she
insinuated
into
her
an
opinion
that
what
she
had
done
already
without
any
other
motive
than
that
of
love
as
she
confessed
in
which
interest
had
no
part
would
make
the
trick
the
easier
to
do
again
especially
if
she
brought
to
her
arms
a
person
of
youth
wit
gallantry
beauty
and
all
the
charming
qualities
that
adorn
a
man
and
that
besides
she
should
find
it
turn
to
good
account
and
for
her
secrecy
she
might
depend
upon
it
since
the
person
to
whose
embraces
she
should
submit
herself
should
not
know
but
that
she
herself
was
the
woman
so
that
says
i
will
have
all
the
infamy
and
you
the
reward
every
way
with
unblemished
while
she
spoke
the
willing
maid
gave
an
inward
pleasing
attention
though
at
first
she
made
a
few
faint
modest
scruples
nor
was
she
less
joyed
to
hear
it
should
be
whom
she
knew
to
be
rich
and
very
handsome
and
she
immediately
found
the
humour
of
inconstancy
seize
her
and
appeared
a
very
husband
lover
in
comparison
of
this
new
brisker
man
of
quality
so
that
after
some
pros
and
cons
the
whole
matter
was
thus
concluded
on
between
these
two
young
persons
who
neither
wanted
wit
nor
beauty
and
both
crowed
over
the
little
contrivance
as
a
most
diverting
piece
of
little
malice
that
should
serve
their
present
turn
and
make
them
sport
for
the
future
the
next
thing
that
was
considered
was
a
letter
which
was
to
be
sent
in
answer
and
that
being
to
write
with
her
own
hand
begot
a
new
doubt
insomuch
as
the
whole
business
was
at
a
stand
for
when
it
came
to
that
point
that
she
herself
was
to
consent
she
found
the
project
look
with
a
face
so
foul
that
she
a
hundred
times
resolved
and
unresolved
but
filled
her
soul
revenge
was
in
her
view
and
that
one
thought
put
her
on
new
resolves
to
pursue
the
design
let
it
be
never
so
base
and
dishonourable
yes
cried
she
at
last
i
can
commit
no
action
that
is
not
more
just
excusable
and
honourable
than
that
which
has
done
to
me
who
uses
me
like
a
common
mistress
of
the
town
and
dares
ask
me
that
which
he
knows
he
durst
not
do
if
he
had
not
mean
and
abject
thoughts
of
me
his
baseness
deserves
death
at
my
hand
if
i
had
courage
to
give
it
him
and
the
least
i
can
do
is
to
deceive
the
deceiver
well
then
give
me
my
escritoire
says
she
so
sitting
down
she
writ
this
not
without
abundance
of
guilt
and
confusion
for
yet
a
certain
honour
which
she
had
by
birth
checked
the
cheat
of
her
pen
sylvia
octavio
the
price
which
you
have
set
upon
your
secret
i
more
generous
than
you
will
give
your
merit
to
which
alone
it
is
due
if
i
should
pay
so
high
a
price
for
the
first
you
would
believe
i
had
the
less
esteem
for
the
last
and
i
would
not
have
you
think
me
so
poor
in
spirit
to
yield
on
any
other
terms
if
i
valued
yet
after
his
confirmed
inconstancy
i
would
have
you
think
i
scorn
to
yield
a
body
where
i
do
not
give
a
soul
and
am
yet
to
be
persuaded
there
are
any
such
brutes
amongst
my
sex
but
as
i
never
had
a
wish
but
where
i
loved
so
i
never
extended
one
till
now
to
any
but
yet
so
much
my
sense
of
shame
is
above
my
growing
tenderness
that
i
could
wish
you
would
be
so
generous
to
think
no
more
of
what
you
seem
to
pursue
with
such
earnestness
and
haste
but
lest
i
should
retain
any
sort
of
former
love
for
whom
i
am
impatient
to
rase
wholly
from
my
soul
i
grant
you
all
you
ask
provided
you
will
be
discreet
in
the
management
therefore
shall
only
be
trusted
with
the
secret
the
outward
gate
you
shall
find
at
twelve
only
shut
to
and
wait
you
at
the
to
conduct
you
to
me
come
alone
i
blush
and
gild
the
paper
with
their
reflections
at
the
thought
of
an
encounter
like
this
before
i
am
half
enough
secured
of
your
heart
and
that
you
may
be
made
more
absolutely
the
master
of
mine
send
me
immediately
letter
enclosed
that
if
any
remains
of
chagrin
possess
me
they
may
be
totally
vanquished
by
twelve
o
clock
sylvia
she
having
with
much
difficulty
writ
this
read
it
to
her
trusty
confidante
for
this
was
the
only
secret
of
her
lady
s
she
was
resolved
never
to
discover
to
and
to
the
end
he
might
know
nothing
of
it
she
sealed
the
letter
with
wax
but
before
she
sealed
it
she
told
her
lady
she
thought
she
might
have
spared
abundance
of
her
blushes
and
have
writ
a
less
kind
letter
for
a
word
of
invitation
or
consent
would
have
served
as
well
to
which
replied
her
anger
against
him
was
too
high
not
to
give
him
all
the
defeat
imaginable
and
the
greater
the
love
appeared
the
greater
would
be
the
revenge
when
he
should
come
to
know
as
in
time
he
should
how
like
a
false
friend
she
had
treated
him
this
reason
or
any
at
that
time
would
have
served
whose
heart
was
set
upon
a
new
adventure
and
in
such
haste
she
was
the
night
coming
on
to
know
how
she
should
dress
and
what
more
was
to
be
done
that
she
only
went
out
to
call
the
page
and
meeting
who
watched
every
body
s
motion
on
the
he
asked
her
what
that
was
and
she
said
to
send
by
page
you
need
not
look
in
it
said
she
when
he
snatched
it
hastily
out
of
her
hand
for
i
can
tell
you
the
contents
and
it
is
sealed
so
it
must
be
known
if
you
unrip
well
well
said
he
if
you
tell
it
me
it
will
satisfy
my
curiosity
as
well
therefore
i
ll
give
it
the
she
returns
in
again
to
her
lady
and
he
to
his
own
chamber
to
read
what
answer
the
dear
object
of
his
desire
had
sent
to
his
forged
one
so
opening
it
he
found
it
such
as
his
soul
wished
and
was
all
joy
and
ecstasy
he
views
himself
a
hundred
times
in
the
glass
and
set
himself
in
order
with
all
the
opinion
and
pride
as
if
his
own
good
parts
had
gained
him
the
blessing
he
enlarged
himself
as
he
walked
and
knew
not
what
to
do
so
extremely
was
he
ravished
with
his
coming
joy
he
blessed
himself
his
wit
his
stars
his
fortune
then
read
the
dear
obliging
letter
and
kissed
it
all
over
as
if
it
had
been
meant
to
him
and
after
he
had
forced
himself
to
a
little
more
serious
consideration
he
bethought
himself
of
what
he
had
to
do
in
order
to
this
dear
appointment
he
finds
in
her
letter
that
in
the
first
place
he
was
to
send
her
the
letter
from
i
told
you
before
he
took
letter
from
the
page
when
he
understood
his
lord
was
going
five
leagues
out
of
town
to
the
prince
could
not
avoid
his
going
and
wrote
to
in
which
he
sent
her
the
letter
writ
wherein
was
the
first
part
of
the
confession
of
his
love
to
madam
the
countess
of
generously
sent
it
without
terms
but
slid
his
own
forged
one
into
hand
in
lieu
of
it
and
now
he
read
that
from
and
wondered
at
his
lord
s
inconstancy
yet
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
take
heart
a
little
more
off
from
him
he
soon
resolved
she
should
have
the
letter
but
being
wholly
mercenary
and
fearing
that
either
when
once
she
had
it
it
might
make
her
go
back
from
her
promised
assignation
or
at
least
put
her
out
of
humour
so
as
to
spoil
a
great
part
of
the
entertainment
he
designed
he
took
the
pains
to
counterfeit
another
billet
to
her
which
was
this
sylvia
since
we
have
begun
to
chaffer
you
must
give
me
leave
to
make
the
best
of
the
advantage
i
find
i
have
upon
you
and
having
violated
my
honour
to
allow
the
breach
of
it
in
some
degree
on
other
occasions
not
but
i
have
all
the
obedience
and
adoration
for
you
that
ever
possessed
the
soul
of
a
most
passionate
and
languishing
lover
but
fair
i
know
not
whether
when
you
have
seen
the
secret
of
the
false
you
may
not
think
it
less
valuable
than
you
before
did
and
so
defraud
me
of
my
due
give
me
leave
oh
wondrous
creature
to
suspect
even
the
most
perfect
of
your
sex
and
to
tell
you
that
i
will
no
sooner
approach
your
presence
but
i
will
resign
the
paper
you
so
much
wish
if
you
send
me
no
answer
i
will
come
according
to
your
directions
if
you
do
i
must
obey
and
wait
though
with
that
impatience
that
never
attended
a
suffering
lover
or
any
but
divine
creature
your
octavio
this
he
sealed
and
after
a
convenient
distance
of
time
carried
as
from
the
page
to
who
was
yet
contriving
with
her
lady
to
whom
she
gives
it
who
read
it
with
abundance
of
impatience
being
extremely
angry
at
the
rudeness
of
the
style
which
she
fancied
much
altered
from
what
it
was
and
had
not
her
rage
blinded
her
she
might
easily
have
perceived
the
difference
too
of
the
character
though
it
came
as
near
to
the
like
as
possible
so
short
a
practice
could
produce
she
took
it
with
the
other
and
tore
it
in
pieces
with
rage
and
swore
she
would
be
revenged
but
after
calmer
thoughts
she
took
up
the
pieces
to
keep
to
upbraid
him
with
and
fell
to
weeping
for
anger
defeat
and
shame
but
the
shower
being
past
she
returned
to
her
former
resentment
and
had
some
pleasure
amidst
all
her
torment
of
fears
jealousies
and
sense
of
disrespect
in
the
thoughts
of
revenge
in
order
to
which
she
contrives
how
shall
manage
herself
and
commanding
her
to
bring
out
some
fine
point
linen
she
dressed
up
head
with
them
and
put
her
on
a
shift
laced
with
the
same
for
though
she
intended
no
light
should
be
in
the
chamber
when
should
enter
she
knew
he
understood
by
his
touch
the
difference
of
fine
things
from
other
in
fine
having
dressed
her
exactly
as
she
herself
used
to
be
when
she
received
visits
in
bed
she
embraced
her
and
fancied
she
was
much
of
her
own
shape
and
bigness
and
that
it
was
impossible
to
find
the
deceit
and
now
she
made
dress
her
up
in
her
clothes
and
mobbing
her
sarsenet
hood
about
her
head
she
appeared
so
like
all
but
the
face
that
it
was
not
easy
to
distinguish
them
and
night
coming
on
they
both
long
for
the
hour
of
twelve
though
with
different
designs
and
having
before
given
notice
that
was
gone
to
bed
and
would
receive
no
visit
that
night
they
were
alone
to
finish
all
their
business
this
while
was
not
idle
but
having
a
fine
bath
made
he
washed
and
perfumed
his
body
and
after
dressed
himself
in
the
finest
linen
perfumed
that
he
had
and
made
himself
as
fit
as
possible
for
his
design
nor
was
his
shape
which
was
very
good
or
his
stature
unlike
to
that
of
and
ready
for
the
approach
he
conveys
himself
out
of
the
house
telling
his
footman
he
would
put
himself
to
bed
after
his
bathing
and
locking
his
chamber
door
stole
out
and
it
being
dark
many
a
longing
turn
he
walked
impatient
till
all
the
candles
were
out
in
every
room
of
the
house
in
the
mean
time
he
employed
his
thoughts
on
a
thousand
things
but
all
relating
to
sometimes
the
treachery
he
shewed
in
this
action
to
his
lord
caused
blushes
in
his
face
which
vanished
as
soon
when
he
considered
his
lord
false
to
the
most
beautiful
of
her
sex
sometimes
he
accused
and
cursed
the
levity
of
that
could
yield
to
and
was
as
jealous
as
if
she
had
indeed
been
to
have
received
that
charming
lover
but
when
his
thought
directed
him
to
his
own
happiness
his
pulse
beat
high
his
blood
flushed
apace
in
his
cheeks
his
eyes
languished
with
love
and
his
body
with
a
feverish
fit
in
these
extremes
by
turns
he
passed
at
least
three
tedious
hours
with
a
striking
watch
in
his
hand
and
when
it
told
it
was
twelve
he
advanced
near
the
door
but
finding
it
shut
walked
yet
with
greater
impatience
every
half
minute
going
to
the
door
at
last
he
found
it
yield
to
his
hand
that
pushed
it
but
oh
what
mortal
can
express
his
joy
his
heart
beats
double
his
knees
tremble
and
a
feebleness
seizes
every
limb
he
breathes
nothing
but
short
sighs
and
is
ready
in
the
dark
hall
to
fall
on
the
floor
and
was
forced
to
lean
on
the
rail
that
begins
the
stairs
to
take
a
little
courage
while
he
was
there
recruiting
himself
intent
on
nothing
but
his
vast
joy
who
going
to
meet
the
prince
being
met
halfway
by
that
young
was
dispatched
back
again
without
advancing
to
the
end
of
his
five
leagues
and
impatient
to
see
after
letter
that
he
had
sent
her
or
at
least
impatient
to
hear
how
she
took
it
and
in
what
condition
she
was
he
as
soon
as
he
alighted
went
towards
her
house
in
order
to
have
met
or
her
page
or
some
that
could
inform
him
of
her
welfare
though
it
was
usual
for
to
sit
up
very
late
and
he
had
often
made
her
visits
at
that
hour
and
wholly
intent
on
his
adventure
had
left
the
door
open
so
that
perceiving
it
believed
they
were
all
up
in
the
back
rooms
where
apartment
was
towards
a
garden
for
he
saw
no
light
forward
but
he
was
no
sooner
entered
which
he
did
without
noise
but
he
heard
a
soft
breathing
which
made
him
stand
in
the
hall
and
by
and
by
he
heard
the
soft
tread
of
some
body
descending
the
stairs
at
this
he
approaches
near
and
the
hall
being
a
marble
floor
his
tread
was
not
heard
when
he
heard
one
cry
with
a
sigh
who
is
there
and
another
replied
it
is
i
who
are
you
the
first
replied
a
faithful
and
an
impatient
give
me
your
hand
then
replied
the
female
voice
i
will
conduct
you
to
your
you
may
imagine
in
what
surprise
was
at
so
unexpected
an
adventure
and
like
a
jealous
lover
did
not
at
all
doubt
but
the
happiness
expected
was
and
the
impatient
lover
some
one
whom
he
could
not
imagine
but
raved
within
to
know
and
in
a
moment
ran
over
in
his
thoughts
all
the
men
of
quality
or
celebrated
beauty
or
fortune
in
the
town
but
was
at
as
great
a
loss
as
at
first
thinking
but
be
thou
who
thou
wilt
cried
he
to
himself
traitor
as
thou
art
i
will
by
thy
death
revenge
myself
on
the
faithless
fair
and
taking
out
his
sword
he
had
advanced
towards
the
when
he
heard
them
both
softly
ascend
but
being
a
man
of
perfect
good
nature
as
all
the
brave
and
witty
are
he
reflected
on
the
severe
usage
he
had
from
notwithstanding
all
his
industry
his
vast
expense
and
all
the
advantages
of
nature
this
thought
made
him
in
the
midst
of
all
his
jealousy
and
haste
pause
a
little
moment
and
fain
he
would
have
persuaded
himself
that
what
he
heard
was
the
errors
of
his
sense
or
that
he
dreamed
or
that
it
was
at
least
not
to
to
whom
this
ascending
lover
was
advancing
but
to
undeceive
him
of
that
favourable
imagination
they
were
no
sooner
on
the
top
of
the
stairs
but
he
not
being
many
steps
behind
could
both
hear
and
see
by
the
ill
light
of
a
great
on
the
the
happy
lover
enter
the
of
which
he
knew
too
well
to
be
mistaken
not
that
he
could
perceive
who
or
what
they
were
but
two
persons
not
to
be
distinguished
oh
what
human
fancy
but
that
of
a
lover
to
that
degree
that
was
our
young
hero
can
imagine
the
amazement
and
torture
of
his
soul
wherein
a
thousand
other
passions
reigned
at
once
and
maugre
all
his
courage
and
resolution
forced
him
to
sink
beneath
their
weight
he
stood
holding
himself
up
by
the
rails
of
the
without
having
the
power
to
ascend
farther
or
to
shew
any
other
signs
of
life
but
that
of
sighing
had
he
been
a
favoured
lover
had
he
been
a
known
declared
lover
to
all
the
world
had
he
but
hoped
he
had
had
so
much
interest
with
the
false
beauty
as
but
to
have
been
designed
upon
for
a
future
love
or
use
he
would
have
rushed
in
and
have
made
the
guilty
night
a
covert
to
a
scene
of
blood
but
even
yet
he
had
an
awe
upon
his
soul
for
the
perjured
fair
one
though
at
the
same
time
he
resolved
she
should
be
the
object
of
his
hate
for
the
nature
of
his
honest
soul
abhorred
an
action
so
treacherous
and
base
he
begins
in
a
moment
from
all
his
good
thoughts
of
her
to
think
her
the
most
jilting
of
her
sex
he
knew
if
interest
could
oblige
her
no
man
in
had
a
better
pretence
to
her
than
himself
who
had
already
without
any
return
even
so
much
as
hope
presented
her
the
value
of
eight
or
ten
thousand
pounds
in
fine
plate
and
jewels
if
it
were
looser
desire
he
fancied
himself
to
have
appeared
as
capable
to
have
served
her
as
any
man
but
oh
he
considers
there
is
a
fate
in
things
a
destiny
in
love
that
elevates
and
advances
the
most
mean
deformed
or
abject
and
debases
and
condemns
the
most
worthy
and
magnificent
then
he
wonders
at
her
excellent
art
of
dissembling
for
he
runs
in
a
minute
over
all
her
passions
of
rage
jealousy
tears
and
softness
and
now
he
hates
the
whole
sex
and
thinks
them
all
like
than
whom
nothing
could
appear
more
despicable
to
his
present
thought
and
with
a
smile
while
yet
his
heart
was
insensibly
breaking
he
fancies
himself
a
very
coxcomb
a
cully
an
imposed
on
fool
and
a
conceited
fop
values
as
a
common
fair
jilt
whose
whole
design
was
to
deceive
the
world
and
make
herself
a
fortune
at
the
price
of
her
honour
one
that
receives
all
kind
bidders
and
that
he
being
too
lavish
and
too
modest
was
reserved
the
cully
on
purpose
to
be
undone
and
jilted
out
of
all
his
fortune
this
thought
was
so
perfectly
fixed
in
him
that
he
recovered
out
of
his
excess
of
pain
and
fancied
himself
perfectly
cured
of
his
blind
passion
resolves
to
leave
her
to
her
beastly
entertainment
and
to
depart
but
before
he
did
so
who
had
conducted
the
amorous
spark
to
the
bed
where
the
expecting
lady
lay
dressed
rich
and
sweet
to
receive
him
returned
out
of
the
chamber
and
the
light
being
a
little
more
favourable
to
his
eyes
by
his
being
so
long
in
the
dark
he
perceived
it
at
least
such
a
sort
of
figure
as
he
fancied
her
and
to
confirm
him
saw
her
go
into
that
chamber
where
he
knew
she
lay
he
saw
her
perfect
dress
and
all
confirmed
him
this
brought
him
back
almost
to
his
former
confusion
but
yet
he
commands
his
passion
and
descended
the
stairs
and
got
himself
out
of
the
hall
into
the
street
and
remembering
the
was
open
went
and
shut
it
and
returned
to
chamber
with
the
letter
which
had
given
to
as
she
lay
in
the
bed
believing
it
for
that
trembling
lover
was
no
sooner
entered
the
chamber
and
approached
the
but
he
kneeled
before
it
and
offered
the
price
of
his
happiness
this
letter
which
she
immediately
gave
to
unperceived
who
quitted
the
room
and
now
with
all
the
eager
haste
of
impatient
love
she
strikes
a
light
and
falls
to
reading
the
sad
contents
but
as
she
read
she
many
times
fainted
over
the
paper
and
as
she
has
since
said
it
was
a
wonder
she
ever
recovered
having
no
body
with
her
by
that
time
she
had
finished
it
she
was
so
ill
she
was
not
able
to
get
herself
into
bed
but
threw
herself
down
on
the
place
where
she
sat
which
was
the
side
of
it
in
such
agony
of
grief
and
despair
as
never
any
soul
was
possessed
of
but
wholly
abandoned
to
the
violence
of
love
and
despair
it
is
impossible
to
paint
a
torment
to
express
hers
by
and
though
she
had
vowed
to
it
should
not
at
all
affect
her
being
so
prepossessed
before
yet
when
she
had
the
confirmation
of
her
fears
and
heard
his
own
dear
soft
words
addressed
to
another
object
saw
his
transports
his
impatience
his
languishing
industry
and
endeavour
to
obtain
the
new
desire
of
his
soul
she
found
her
resentment
above
rage
and
given
over
to
a
more
silent
and
less
supportable
torment
brought
herself
into
a
high
fever
where
she
lay
without
so
much
as
calling
for
aid
in
her
extremity
not
that
she
was
afraid
the
cheat
she
had
put
on
would
be
discovered
for
she
had
lost
the
remembrance
that
any
such
prank
was
played
and
in
this
multitude
of
thoughts
of
more
concern
had
forgot
all
the
rest
of
that
night
s
action
this
while
was
traversing
the
street
wrapped
in
his
cloak
just
as
if
he
had
come
from
horse
for
he
was
no
sooner
gone
from
the
door
but
his
resenting
passion
returned
and
he
resolved
to
go
up
again
and
disturb
the
lovers
though
it
cost
him
his
life
and
fame
but
returning
hastily
to
the
door
he
found
it
shut
at
which
being
enraged
he
was
often
about
to
break
it
open
but
still
some
unperceivable
respect
for
prevented
him
but
he
resolved
not
to
stir
from
the
door
till
he
saw
the
fortunate
rogue
come
out
who
had
given
him
all
this
torment
at
first
he
cursed
himself
for
being
so
much
concerned
for
or
her
actions
to
waste
a
minute
but
flattering
himself
that
it
was
not
love
to
her
but
pure
curiosity
to
know
the
man
who
was
made
the
next
fool
to
himself
though
the
more
happy
one
he
waited
all
night
and
when
he
began
to
see
the
day
break
which
he
thought
a
thousand
years
his
eye
was
never
off
from
the
door
and
wondered
at
their
confidence
who
would
let
the
day
break
upon
them
but
the
curtains
there
cried
he
the
happy
still
he
walked
on
and
still
he
might
for
any
rival
that
was
to
appear
for
a
most
unlucky
accident
prevented
coming
out
as
he
doubly
intended
to
do
first
for
the
better
carrying
on
of
his
cheat
of
being
and
next
that
he
had
challenged
to
fight
and
when
he
knew
his
error
designed
to
have
gone
this
morning
and
asked
him
pardon
if
he
had
been
returned
but
the
amorous
lover
over
night
ordering
himself
for
the
encounter
to
the
best
advantage
had
sent
a
note
to
a
doctor
for
something
that
would
encourage
his
spirits
the
doctor
came
and
opening
a
little
box
wherein
was
a
powerful
medicine
he
told
him
that
a
dose
of
those
little
flies
would
make
him
come
off
with
wondrous
honour
in
the
battle
of
love
and
the
doctor
being
gone
to
call
for
a
glass
of
sack
the
doctor
having
laid
out
of
the
box
what
he
thought
requisite
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
leaving
the
box
open
our
spark
thought
if
such
a
dose
would
encourage
him
so
a
greater
would
yet
make
him
do
greater
wonders
and
taking
twice
the
quantity
out
of
the
box
puts
them
into
his
pocket
and
having
drank
the
first
with
full
directions
the
doctor
leaves
him
who
was
no
sooner
gone
but
he
takes
those
out
of
his
pocket
and
in
a
glass
of
sack
drinks
them
down
after
this
he
bathes
and
dresses
and
believes
himself
a
very
that
could
have
got
at
least
twelve
sons
that
happy
night
but
he
was
no
sooner
laid
in
bed
with
the
charming
as
he
thought
but
he
was
taken
with
intolerable
gripes
and
pains
such
as
he
had
never
felt
before
insomuch
that
he
was
not
able
to
lie
in
the
bed
this
enrages
him
he
grows
mad
and
ashamed
sometimes
he
had
little
intermissions
for
a
moment
of
ease
and
then
he
would
plead
softly
by
her
and
ask
ten
thousand
pardons
which
being
easily
granted
he
would
go
into
bed
again
but
then
the
pain
would
seize
him
anew
so
that
after
two
or
three
hours
of
distraction
he
was
forced
to
dress
and
retire
but
instead
of
going
down
he
went
softly
up
to
his
own
chamber
where
he
sat
him
down
and
cursed
the
world
himself
and
his
hard
fate
and
in
this
extremity
of
pain
shame
and
grief
he
remained
till
break
of
day
by
which
time
who
was
almost
as
violently
afflicted
got
her
coats
on
and
went
to
her
own
chamber
where
she
found
her
lady
more
dead
than
alive
she
immediately
shifted
her
and
made
her
bed
and
conducted
her
to
it
without
endeavouring
to
divert
her
with
the
history
of
her
own
misfortune
and
only
asked
her
many
questions
concerning
her
being
thus
ill
to
which
the
wretched
only
answered
with
sighs
so
that
perceived
it
was
the
letter
that
had
disordered
her
and
begged
she
might
be
permitted
to
see
it
she
gave
her
leave
and
read
it
but
no
sooner
was
she
come
to
that
part
of
it
which
named
the
countess
of
but
she
asked
her
lady
if
she
understood
who
that
person
was
with
great
amazement
at
this
was
content
to
speak
pleased
a
little
that
she
should
have
an
account
of
her
rival
no
said
she
dost
thou
know
her
yes
madam
replied
particularly
well
for
i
have
served
her
ever
since
i
was
a
girl
of
five
years
old
she
being
of
the
same
age
with
me
and
sent
at
six
years
old
both
to
a
monastery
for
she
being
fond
of
my
play
her
father
sent
me
at
that
age
with
her
both
to
serve
and
to
divert
her
with
babies
and
baubles
there
we
lived
seven
years
together
when
an
old
rich
the
count
of
fell
in
love
with
my
lady
and
married
her
from
the
monastery
before
she
had
seen
any
part
of
the
world
beyond
those
sanctified
walls
she
cried
bitterly
to
have
had
me
to
with
her
but
he
said
i
was
too
young
now
for
her
service
and
so
sent
me
away
back
to
my
own
town
which
is
this
and
here
my
lady
was
born
too
and
is
sister
to
here
she
stopped
fearing
to
tell
which
perceiving
with
a
briskness
which
her
indisposition
one
would
have
thought
could
not
have
allowed
sat
up
in
bed
and
cried
ha
sister
to
whom
oh
how
thou
wouldst
please
me
to
say
to
why
madam
would
it
please
you
said
the
blushing
maid
because
said
it
would
in
part
revenge
me
on
his
bold
addresses
to
me
and
he
would
also
be
obliged
in
honour
to
his
family
to
revenge
himself
on
ah
madam
said
she
as
to
his
presumption
towards
you
fortune
has
sufficiently
revenged
it
at
this
she
hung
down
her
head
and
looked
very
foolishly
how
said
smiling
and
rearing
herself
yet
more
in
her
bed
is
any
misfortune
arrived
to
oh
how
i
will
triumph
and
upbraid
the
daring
man
tell
me
quickly
what
it
is
for
nothing
would
rejoice
me
more
than
to
hear
he
were
punished
a
upon
this
told
her
what
an
unlucky
night
she
had
how
was
seized
and
how
he
departed
by
which
believed
he
had
made
some
discovery
of
the
cheat
that
was
put
upon
him
and
that
he
only
feigned
illness
to
get
himself
loose
from
her
embraces
and
now
she
falls
to
considering
how
she
shall
be
revenged
on
both
her
lovers
and
the
best
she
can
pitch
upon
is
that
of
setting
them
both
at
odds
and
making
them
fight
and
revenge
themselves
on
one
another
but
she
like
a
right
woman
could
not
dissemble
her
resentment
of
jealousy
whatever
art
she
had
to
do
so
in
any
other
point
but
mad
to
ease
her
soul
that
was
full
and
to
upbraid
she
writes
him
a
letter
but
not
till
she
had
once
more
to
make
her
read
his
over
again
which
he
sent
sylvia
philander
yes
perjured
villain
at
last
all
thy
perfidy
is
arrived
to
my
knowledge
and
thou
hadst
better
have
been
damned
or
have
fallen
like
an
ungrateful
traitor
as
thou
art
under
the
public
shame
of
dying
by
the
common
executioner
than
have
fallen
under
the
grasp
of
my
revenge
insatiate
as
thy
lust
false
as
thy
treasons
to
thy
prince
fatal
as
thy
destiny
loud
as
thy
infamy
and
bloody
as
thy
party
villain
villain
where
got
you
the
courage
to
use
me
thus
knowing
my
injuries
and
my
spirit
thou
seest
base
traitor
i
do
not
fall
on
thee
with
treachery
as
thou
hast
with
thy
king
and
mistress
to
which
thou
hast
broken
thy
holy
vows
of
allegiance
and
eternal
love
but
thou
that
hast
broken
the
laws
of
god
and
nature
what
could
i
expect
when
neither
religion
honour
common
justice
nor
law
could
bind
thee
to
humanity
thou
that
betrayest
thy
prince
abandonest
thy
wife
renouncest
thy
child
killest
thy
mother
ravishest
thy
sister
and
art
in
open
rebellion
against
thy
native
country
and
very
kindred
and
brothers
oh
after
this
what
must
the
wretch
expect
who
has
believed
thee
and
followed
thy
abject
fortunes
the
miserable
slave
and
contempt
of
the
world
what
could
she
expect
but
that
the
villain
is
still
potent
in
the
unrepented
and
all
the
lover
dead
and
gone
the
vice
remains
and
all
the
virtue
vanished
oh
what
could
i
expect
from
such
a
devil
so
lost
in
sin
and
wickedness
that
even
those
for
whom
he
ventured
all
his
fame
and
lost
his
fortune
lent
like
a
upon
the
public
faith
on
the
security
of
rogues
knaves
and
traitors
even
those
i
say
turned
him
out
of
their
councils
for
a
reprobate
too
lewd
for
the
villainous
society
oh
cursed
that
i
was
by
heaven
and
fate
to
be
blind
and
deaf
to
all
thy
infamy
and
suffer
thy
adorable
bewitching
face
and
tongue
to
charm
me
to
madness
and
undoing
when
that
was
all
thou
hadst
left
thee
thy
false
person
to
cheat
the
silly
easy
fond
believing
world
into
any
sort
of
opinion
of
thee
for
not
one
good
principle
was
left
not
one
poor
virtue
to
guard
thee
from
damnation
thou
hadst
but
one
friend
left
thee
one
true
on
real
friend
and
that
was
wretched
she
when
all
abandoned
thee
but
the
executioner
fled
with
thee
suffered
with
thee
starved
with
thee
lost
her
fame
and
honour
with
thee
lost
her
friends
her
parents
and
all
her
beauty
s
hopes
for
thee
and
in
lieu
of
all
found
only
the
accusation
of
all
the
good
the
hate
of
all
the
virtuous
the
reproaches
of
her
kindred
the
scorn
of
all
chaste
maids
and
curses
of
all
honest
wives
and
in
requital
had
only
thy
false
vows
thy
empty
love
thy
faithless
embraces
and
cold
dissembling
kisses
my
only
comfort
was
ah
miserable
comfort
to
fancy
they
were
true
now
that
it
is
departed
too
and
i
have
nothing
but
a
brave
revenge
left
in
the
room
of
all
in
which
i
will
be
as
merciless
and
irreligious
as
even
thou
hast
been
in
all
thy
actions
and
there
remains
about
me
only
this
sense
of
honour
yet
that
i
dare
tell
thee
of
my
bold
design
a
bravery
thou
hast
never
shewed
to
me
who
takest
me
unawares
stabb
st
me
without
a
warning
of
the
blow
so
would
st
thou
serve
thy
king
hadst
thou
but
power
and
so
thou
servest
thy
mistress
when
i
look
back
even
to
thy
infancy
thy
life
has
been
but
one
continued
race
of
treachery
and
i
destined
thy
evil
genius
was
born
for
thy
tormentor
for
thou
hast
made
a
very
fiend
of
me
and
i
have
hell
within
all
rage
all
torment
fire
distraction
madness
i
rave
i
burn
i
tear
myself
and
faint
am
still
a
dying
but
can
never
fall
till
i
have
grasped
thee
with
me
oh
i
should
laugh
in
flames
to
see
thee
howling
by
i
scorn
thee
hate
thee
loathe
thee
more
than
ever
i
have
loved
thee
and
hate
myself
so
much
for
ever
loving
thee
to
be
revenged
upon
the
filthy
criminal
i
will
expose
myself
to
all
the
world
cheat
jilt
and
flatter
all
as
thou
hast
done
and
having
not
one
sense
or
grain
of
honour
left
will
yield
the
abandoned
body
thou
hast
rifled
to
every
asking
fop
nor
is
that
all
for
they
that
purchase
this
shall
buy
it
at
the
price
of
being
my
and
all
shall
aid
in
my
revenge
on
thee
all
merciless
and
as
resolved
as
i
as
i
the
injured
sylvia
having
shot
this
flash
of
the
lightning
of
her
soul
and
finished
her
rant
she
found
herself
much
easier
in
the
resolves
on
revenge
she
had
fixed
there
she
scorned
by
any
vain
endeavour
to
recall
him
from
his
passion
she
had
wit
enough
to
have
made
those
eternal
observations
that
love
once
gone
is
never
to
be
retrieved
and
that
it
was
impossible
to
cease
loving
and
then
again
to
love
the
same
person
one
may
believe
for
some
time
one
s
love
is
abated
but
when
it
comes
to
a
trial
it
shews
itself
as
vigorous
as
in
its
first
shine
and
finds
its
own
error
but
when
once
one
comes
to
love
a
new
object
it
can
never
return
with
more
than
pity
compassion
or
civility
for
the
first
this
is
a
most
certain
truth
which
all
lovers
will
find
as
most
wives
may
experience
and
which
our
now
took
for
granted
and
gave
him
over
for
dead
to
all
but
her
revenge
though
fits
of
softness
weeping
raving
and
tearing
would
by
turns
seize
the
distracted
abandoned
beauty
in
which
extremities
she
has
recourse
to
scorn
and
pride
too
feeble
to
aid
her
too
often
the
first
thing
she
resolved
on
by
the
advice
of
her
reasonable
counsellor
was
to
hear
love
at
both
ears
no
matter
whether
she
regard
it
or
not
but
to
hear
all
as
a
remedy
against
loving
one
in
particular
for
it
is
most
certain
that
the
use
of
hearing
love
or
of
making
love
though
at
first
without
design
either
in
women
or
men
shall
at
last
unfix
the
most
confirmed
and
constant
resolution
and
since
you
are
assured
continued
that
sighs
nor
tears
bring
back
the
wandering
lover
and
that
dying
for
him
will
be
no
revenge
on
him
but
rather
a
kind
assurance
that
you
will
no
more
trouble
the
man
who
is
already
weary
of
you
you
ought
with
all
your
power
industry
and
reason
rather
to
seek
the
preservation
of
that
beauty
of
that
fine
humour
to
serve
you
on
all
occasions
either
of
revenge
or
love
than
by
a
foolish
and
insignificant
concern
and
sorrow
reduce
yourself
to
the
condition
of
being
scorned
by
all
or
at
best
but
how
pitied
cried
the
haughty
is
there
any
thing
so
insupportable
to
our
sex
as
pity
no
surely
replied
the
servant
tis
accompanied
by
love
oh
what
blessed
comfort
tis
to
hear
people
cry
she
was
once
charming
once
a
is
any
thing
more
grating
madam
at
this
rate
she
ran
on
and
left
nothing
unsaid
that
might
animate
the
angry
to
love
anew
or
at
least
to
receive
and
admit
of
love
for
in
that
climate
the
air
naturally
breeds
spirits
avaricious
and
much
inclines
them
to
the
love
of
money
which
they
will
gain
at
any
price
or
hazard
and
all
this
discourse
to
was
but
to
incline
the
revengeful
listening
beauty
to
admit
of
the
addresses
of
because
she
knew
he
would
make
her
fortune
thus
was
the
unhappy
maid
left
by
her
own
unfortunate
conduct
encompassed
in
on
every
side
with
distraction
and
she
was
pointed
out
by
fate
to
be
made
the
most
wretched
of
all
her
sex
nor
had
she
left
one
faithful
friend
to
advise
or
stay
her
youth
in
its
hasty
advance
to
ruin
she
hears
the
persuading
eloquence
of
the
flattering
maid
and
finds
now
nothing
so
prevalent
on
her
soul
as
revenge
and
nothing
soothes
it
more
and
among
all
her
lovers
or
those
at
least
that
she
knew
adored
her
none
was
found
so
proper
an
instrument
as
the
noble
his
youth
his
wit
his
gallantry
but
above
all
his
fortune
pleads
most
powerfully
with
her
so
that
she
resolves
upon
the
revenge
and
fixes
him
the
man
whom
she
now
knew
by
so
many
obligations
was
obliged
to
serve
her
turn
on
thus
found
a
little
tranquillity
such
as
it
was
in
hope
of
revenge
while
the
passionate
was
wrecked
with
a
thousand
pains
and
torments
such
as
none
but
jilted
lovers
can
imagine
and
having
a
thousand
times
resolved
to
hate
her
and
as
often
to
love
on
in
spite
of
all
after
a
thousand
arguments
against
her
and
as
many
in
favour
of
her
he
arrived
only
to
this
knowledge
that
his
love
was
extreme
and
that
he
had
no
power
over
his
heart
that
honour
fame
interest
and
whatever
else
might
oppose
his
violent
flame
were
all
too
weak
to
extinguish
the
least
spark
of
it
and
all
the
conquest
he
could
get
of
himself
was
that
he
suffered
all
his
torment
all
the
hell
of
raging
jealousy
grown
to
confirmation
and
all
the
pangs
of
absence
for
that
whole
day
and
had
the
courage
to
live
on
the
rack
without
easing
one
moment
of
his
agony
by
a
letter
or
billet
which
in
such
cases
discharges
the
burden
and
pressures
of
the
heart
and
who
dressed
and
suffered
herself
wholly
to
be
carried
away
by
her
vengeance
expected
him
with
as
much
impatience
as
ever
she
did
the
coming
of
the
once
adorable
though
with
a
different
passion
but
all
the
day
passed
in
expectation
of
him
and
no
lover
appeared
no
not
so
much
as
a
billet
nor
page
at
her
to
ask
her
health
so
that
believing
he
had
been
very
ill
indeed
from
what
told
her
of
his
being
so
all
night
and
fearing
now
that
it
was
no
discovery
of
the
cheat
put
upon
him
by
the
exchange
of
the
maid
for
the
mistress
but
real
sickness
she
resolved
to
send
to
him
and
the
rather
because
assured
her
he
was
really
sick
and
in
a
cold
damp
sweat
all
over
his
face
and
hands
which
she
touched
and
that
from
his
infinite
concern
at
the
defeat
the
extreme
respect
he
shewed
her
in
midst
of
all
the
rage
at
his
own
disappointment
and
every
circumstance
she
knew
it
was
no
feigned
thing
for
any
discovery
he
had
made
on
this
confirmation
from
a
maid
cunning
enough
to
distinguish
truth
from
flattery
she
writ
this
letter
at
night
sylvia
octavio
after
such
a
parting
from
a
maid
so
entirely
kind
to
you
she
might
at
least
have
hoped
the
favour
of
a
billet
from
you
to
have
informed
her
of
your
health
unless
you
think
that
after
we
have
surrendered
all
we
are
of
the
humour
of
most
of
your
sex
who
despise
the
obliger
but
i
believed
you
a
man
above
the
little
crimes
and
levities
of
your
race
and
i
am
yet
so
hard
to
be
drawn
from
that
opinion
i
am
willing
to
flatter
myself
that
tis
yet
some
other
reason
that
has
hindered
you
from
visiting
me
since
or
sending
me
an
account
of
your
recovery
which
i
am
too
sensible
of
to
believe
was
feigned
and
which
indeed
has
made
me
so
tender
that
i
easily
forgive
all
the
disappointment
i
received
from
it
and
beg
you
will
not
afflict
yourself
at
any
loss
you
sustained
by
it
since
i
am
still
so
much
the
same
i
was
to
be
as
sensible
as
before
of
all
the
obligations
i
have
to
you
send
me
word
immediately
how
you
do
for
on
that
depends
a
great
part
of
the
happiness
of
sylvia
you
may
easily
see
by
this
letter
she
was
not
in
a
humour
of
either
writing
love
or
much
flattery
for
yet
she
knew
not
how
she
ought
to
resent
this
absence
in
all
kinds
from
and
therefore
with
what
force
she
could
put
upon
a
soul
too
wholly
taken
up
with
the
thoughts
of
another
more
dear
and
more
afflicting
she
only
writ
this
to
fetch
one
from
him
that
by
it
she
might
learn
part
of
his
sentiment
of
her
last
action
and
sent
her
page
with
it
to
him
who
as
was
usual
was
carried
directly
up
to
whom
he
found
in
a
gallery
walking
in
a
most
dejected
posture
without
a
band
unbraced
his
arms
his
open
breast
and
his
eyes
bent
to
the
floor
and
not
taking
any
notice
when
the
pages
entered
his
own
was
forced
to
pull
him
by
the
sleeve
before
he
would
look
up
and
starting
from
a
thousand
thoughts
that
oppressed
him
almost
to
death
he
gazed
wildly
about
him
and
asked
their
business
when
the
page
delivered
him
the
letter
he
took
it
but
with
such
confusion
as
he
had
much
ado
to
support
himself
but
resolving
not
to
shew
his
feebleness
to
her
page
he
made
a
shift
to
get
a
that
was
on
the
table
and
read
it
and
was
not
much
amazed
at
the
contents
believing
she
was
pursuing
the
business
of
her
sex
and
life
and
jilting
him
on
for
such
was
his
opinion
of
all
women
now
he
forced
a
smile
of
scorn
though
his
soul
were
bursting
and
turning
to
the
page
gave
him
a
liberal
reward
as
was
his
daily
use
when
he
came
and
mustered
up
so
much
courage
as
to
force
himself
to
say
child
tell
your
lady
it
requires
no
answer
you
may
tell
her
too
that
i
am
in
perfect
good
health
he
was
oppressed
to
speak
more
but
sighs
stopped
him
and
his
former
resolution
wholly
to
abandon
all
correspondence
with
her
checked
his
forward
tongue
and
he
walked
away
to
prevent
himself
from
saying
more
while
the
page
who
wondered
at
this
turn
of
love
after
a
little
waiting
departed
and
when
had
ended
his
walk
and
turned
and
saw
him
gone
his
heart
felt
a
thousand
pangs
not
to
be
borne
or
supported
he
was
often
ready
to
recall
him
and
was
angry
the
boy
did
not
urge
him
for
an
answer
he
read
the
letter
again
and
wonders
at
nothing
now
after
her
last
night
s
action
though
all
was
riddle
to
him
he
found
it
was
writ
to
some
happier
man
than
himself
however
he
chanced
to
have
it
by
mistake
and
turning
to
the
outside
viewed
the
superscription
where
there
happened
to
be
none
at
all
for
writ
in
haste
and
when
she
did
it
it
was
the
least
of
her
thoughts
and
now
he
believed
he
had
found
out
the
real
mystery
that
it
was
not
meant
to
him
he
therefore
calls
his
page
whom
he
sent
immediately
after
that
of
who
being
yet
below
for
the
lads
were
laughing
together
for
a
moment
he
brought
him
to
his
distracted
lord
who
nevertheless
assumed
a
mildness
to
the
innocent
boy
and
cried
my
child
thou
hast
mistaken
the
person
to
whom
thou
shouldst
have
carried
the
letter
and
i
am
sorry
i
opened
it
pray
return
it
to
the
happy
man
it
was
meant
to
giving
him
the
letter
my
lord
replied
the
boy
i
do
not
use
to
carry
letters
to
any
but
your
lordship
it
is
the
footmen
s
business
to
do
that
to
other
is
a
mistake
where
ever
it
lies
cried
sighing
in
thee
or
thy
lady
so
turning
from
the
wondering
boy
he
left
him
to
return
with
his
letter
to
his
lady
who
grew
mad
at
the
relation
of
what
she
heard
from
the
page
and
notwithstanding
the
torment
she
had
upon
her
soul
occasioned
by
she
now
found
she
had
more
to
endure
and
that
in
spite
of
all
her
and
resentments
she
had
something
for
to
which
she
could
not
give
a
name
she
fancies
it
all
pride
and
concern
for
the
indignity
put
on
her
beauty
but
whatever
it
was
this
slight
of
his
so
wholly
took
up
her
soul
that
she
had
for
some
time
quite
forgot
or
when
she
did
think
on
him
it
was
with
less
resentment
than
of
this
affront
she
considers
with
some
excuse
now
as
having
long
been
possessed
of
a
happiness
he
might
grow
weary
of
but
a
new
lover
who
had
for
six
months
incessantly
lain
at
her
feet
imploring
dying
vowing
weeping
sighing
giving
and
acting
all
things
the
most
passionate
of
men
was
capable
of
or
that
love
could
inspire
for
him
to
be
at
last
admitted
to
the
possession
of
the
ravishing
object
of
his
vows
and
soul
to
be
laid
in
her
bed
nay
in
her
very
arms
as
she
imagined
he
thought
and
then
even
before
gathering
the
roses
he
came
to
pluck
before
he
had
begun
to
compose
or
finished
his
nosegay
to
depart
the
happy
paradise
with
a
disgust
and
such
a
disgust
as
first
to
oblige
him
to
dissemble
sickness
and
next
fall
even
from
all
his
civilities
was
a
contempt
she
was
not
able
to
bear
especially
from
him
of
whom
all
men
living
she
designed
to
make
the
greatest
property
of
as
most
fit
for
her
revenge
of
all
degrees
and
sorts
but
when
she
reflected
with
reason
which
she
seldom
did
for
either
love
or
rage
blinded
that
she
could
not
conceive
it
possible
that
could
be
fallen
so
suddenly
from
all
his
vows
and
professions
but
on
some
very
great
provocation
sometimes
she
thinks
he
tempted
her
to
try
her
virtue
to
and
being
a
perfect
honourable
friend
hates
her
for
her
levity
but
she
considers
his
presents
and
his
unwearied
industry
and
believes
he
would
not
at
that
expense
have
bought
a
knowledge
which
could
profit
neither
himself
nor
then
she
believes
some
disgusted
scent
or
something
about
might
disoblige
him
but
having
called
the
maid
conjuring
her
to
tell
her
whether
any
thing
passed
between
her
and
she
again
told
her
lady
the
whole
truth
in
which
there
could
be
no
discovery
of
infirmity
there
she
embraced
her
she
kissed
her
bosom
and
found
her
touches
soft
her
breath
and
bosom
sweet
as
any
thing
in
nature
could
be
and
now
lost
almost
in
a
confusion
of
thought
she
could
not
tell
what
to
imagine
at
last
she
being
wholly
possessed
that
all
the
fault
was
not
in
for
too
often
we
believe
as
we
hope
she
concludes
that
has
told
him
all
the
cheat
she
put
upon
him
this
last
thought
pleased
her
because
it
seemed
the
most
probable
and
was
the
most
favourable
to
herself
and
a
thought
that
if
true
could
not
do
her
any
injury
with
him
this
set
her
heart
a
little
to
rights
and
she
grew
calm
with
a
belief
that
if
so
it
was
as
now
she
doubted
not
a
sight
of
her
or
a
future
hope
from
her
would
calm
all
his
discontent
and
beget
a
right
understanding
she
therefore
resolves
to
write
to
him
and
own
her
little
fallacy
but
before
she
did
so
whose
passion
was
violent
as
ever
in
his
soul
though
it
was
oppressed
with
a
thousand
torments
and
languished
under
as
many
feeble
resolutions
burst
at
last
into
all
its
former
softness
and
he
resolves
to
write
to
the
false
fair
one
and
upbraid
her
with
her
last
night
s
infidelity
nor
could
he
sleep
till
he
had
that
way
charmed
his
senses
and
eased
his
sick
afflicted
soul
it
being
now
ten
at
night
and
he
retired
to
his
chamber
he
set
himself
down
and
writ
this
octavio
sylvia
you
have
at
last
taught
me
a
perfect
knowledge
of
myself
and
in
one
unhappy
night
made
me
see
all
the
follies
and
vanities
of
my
soul
which
and
fond
imagination
had
too
long
rendered
that
way
guilty
long
long
i
have
played
the
fop
as
others
do
and
shewed
the
gaudy
monsieur
and
set
a
value
on
my
worthless
person
for
being
well
dressed
as
i
believed
and
furnished
out
for
conquest
by
being
the
gayest
coxcomb
in
the
town
where
even
as
i
passed
perhaps
i
fancied
i
made
advances
on
some
wishing
hearts
and
vain
with
but
imaginary
victory
i
still
fooled
on
and
was
at
last
undone
for
i
saw
the
charming
faithless
a
beauty
that
one
would
have
thought
had
had
the
power
to
have
cured
the
fond
disease
of
and
foppery
since
love
they
say
is
a
remedy
against
those
faults
of
youth
but
still
my
vanity
was
powerful
in
me
and
even
this
beauty
too
i
thought
it
not
impossible
to
vanquish
and
still
dressed
on
and
took
a
mighty
care
to
shew
myself
a
blockhead
curse
upon
me
while
you
were
laughing
at
my
industry
and
turned
the
fancying
fool
to
ridicule
oh
he
deserved
it
well
most
wondrous
well
for
but
believing
any
thing
about
him
could
merit
but
a
serious
thought
from
whose
business
is
to
laugh
at
all
yet
love
that
is
my
sin
and
punishment
reigns
still
as
absolutely
in
my
soul
as
when
i
wished
and
hoped
and
longed
for
mighty
blessings
you
could
give
yes
i
still
love
only
this
wretchedness
is
fixed
to
it
to
see
those
errors
which
i
can
not
shun
my
love
is
as
high
but
all
my
wishes
gone
my
passion
still
remains
entire
and
raving
but
no
desire
i
burn
i
die
but
do
not
wish
to
hope
i
would
be
all
despair
and
like
a
martyr
am
vain
and
proud
even
in
suffering
yes
when
you
made
me
wise
you
made
me
wretched
too
before
like
a
false
worshipper
i
only
saw
the
gay
the
gilded
side
of
the
deceiving
idol
but
now
it
is
fallen
discovers
all
the
cheat
and
shews
a
god
no
more
and
it
is
in
love
as
in
religion
too
there
is
nothing
makes
their
votaries
truly
happy
but
being
well
deceived
for
even
in
love
itself
harmless
and
innocent
as
it
is
by
nature
there
needs
a
little
art
to
hide
the
daily
discontents
and
torments
that
fears
distrusts
and
jealousies
create
a
little
soft
dissimulation
is
needful
for
where
the
lover
is
easy
he
is
most
constant
but
oh
when
love
itself
is
defective
too
and
managed
by
design
and
little
interest
what
cunning
oh
what
cautions
ought
the
fair
designer
then
to
call
to
her
defence
yet
i
confess
your
plot
still
charming
was
subtly
enough
contrived
discreetly
carried
on
the
shades
of
night
the
happy
lover
s
refuge
favoured
you
too
it
was
only
fate
was
cruel
fate
that
conducted
me
in
an
unlucky
hour
dark
as
it
was
and
silent
too
the
night
i
saw
yes
faithless
fair
i
saw
i
was
betrayed
by
too
much
faith
by
too
much
love
undone
i
saw
my
fatal
ruin
and
your
perfidy
and
like
a
tame
ignoble
sufferer
left
you
without
revenge
i
must
confess
oh
thou
deceiving
fair
one
i
never
could
pretend
to
what
i
wished
and
yet
methinks
because
i
know
my
heart
and
the
entire
devotion
that
is
paid
you
i
merited
at
least
not
to
have
been
imposed
upon
but
after
so
dishonourable
an
action
as
the
betraying
the
secret
of
my
friend
it
was
but
just
that
i
should
be
betrayed
and
you
have
paid
me
well
deservedly
well
and
that
shall
make
me
silent
and
whatsoever
i
suffer
however
i
die
however
i
languish
out
my
wretched
life
i
ll
bear
my
sighs
where
you
shall
never
hear
them
nor
the
reproaches
my
complaints
express
live
thou
a
punishment
to
vain
fantastic
hoping
youth
live
and
advance
in
cunning
and
deceit
to
make
the
fond
believing
men
more
wise
and
teach
the
women
new
arts
of
falsehood
till
they
deceive
so
long
that
man
may
hate
and
set
as
vast
a
distance
between
sex
and
sex
as
i
have
resolved
oh
thou
shalt
be
for
ever
from
octavio
this
letter
came
just
as
was
going
to
write
to
him
of
which
she
was
extremely
glad
for
all
along
there
was
nothing
expressed
that
could
make
her
think
he
meant
any
other
than
the
cheat
she
put
upon
him
in
instead
of
herself
and
it
was
some
ease
to
her
mind
to
be
assured
of
the
cause
of
his
anger
and
absence
and
to
find
her
own
thought
confirmed
that
he
had
indeed
discovered
the
truth
of
the
matter
she
knew
since
that
was
all
she
could
easily
reconcile
him
by
a
plain
confession
and
giving
him
new
hopes
she
therefore
writes
this
answer
to
him
which
she
sent
by
his
page
who
waited
for
it
sylvia
octavio
i
own
too
angry
and
too
nice
the
crime
you
charge
me
with
and
did
believe
a
person
of
your
gallantry
wit
and
gaiety
would
have
passed
over
so
little
a
fault
with
only
reproaching
me
pleasantly
i
did
not
expect
so
grave
a
reproof
or
rather
so
serious
an
accusation
youth
has
a
thousand
follies
to
answer
for
and
can
not
pardon
one
sally
of
it
in
i
rather
expected
to
have
seen
you
early
here
this
morning
pleasantly
rallying
my
little
perfidy
than
to
find
you
railing
at
a
distance
at
it
calling
it
by
a
thousand
names
that
does
not
merit
half
this
malice
and
sure
you
do
not
think
me
so
poor
in
good
nature
but
i
could
some
other
coming
hour
have
made
you
amends
for
those
you
lost
last
night
possibly
i
could
have
wished
myself
with
you
at
the
same
time
and
had
i
perhaps
followed
my
inclination
i
had
made
you
happy
as
you
wished
but
there
were
powerful
reasons
that
prevented
me
i
conjure
you
to
let
me
see
you
where
i
will
make
a
confession
of
my
last
night
s
sin
and
give
such
arguments
to
convince
you
of
the
necessity
of
it
as
shall
absolutely
reconcile
you
to
love
hope
and
sylvia
it
being
late
she
only
sent
this
short
billet
and
not
hoping
that
night
to
see
him
she
went
to
bed
after
having
inquired
the
health
of
who
she
heard
was
very
ill
and
that
young
defeated
lover
finding
it
impossible
to
meet
as
he
had
promised
not
to
fight
him
but
to
ask
his
pardon
for
his
mistake
made
a
shift
with
much
ado
to
write
him
a
note
which
was
this
i
confess
my
yesterday
s
rudeness
and
beg
you
will
give
me
a
pardon
before
i
leave
the
world
for
i
was
last
night
taken
violently
ill
and
am
unable
to
wait
on
your
lordship
to
beg
what
this
most
earnestly
does
for
your
lordship
s
most
devoted
servant
brilliard
this
billet
though
it
signified
nothing
to
it
served
afterwards
to
very
good
use
and
purpose
as
a
little
time
shall
make
appear
and
received
these
two
notes
from
and
at
the
same
time
the
one
he
flung
by
regardless
the
other
he
read
with
infinite
pain
scorn
hate
indignation
all
at
once
stormed
in
his
heart
he
felt
every
passion
there
but
that
of
love
which
caused
them
all
if
he
thought
her
false
and
ungrateful
before
he
now
thinks
her
fallen
to
the
lowest
degree
of
lewdness
to
own
her
crime
with
such
impudence
he
fancies
now
he
is
cured
of
love
and
hates
her
absolutely
thinks
her
below
even
his
scorn
and
puts
himself
to
bed
believing
he
shall
sleep
as
well
as
before
he
saw
the
light
the
foolish
but
oh
he
boasts
in
vain
the
light
the
foolish
was
charming
still
still
all
the
beauty
appeared
even
in
his
slumbers
the
angel
dawned
about
him
and
all
the
fiend
was
laid
he
sees
her
lovely
face
but
the
false
heart
is
hid
he
hears
her
charming
wit
but
all
the
cunning
is
hushed
he
views
the
motions
of
her
delicate
body
without
regard
to
those
of
her
mind
he
thinks
of
all
the
tender
words
she
has
given
him
in
which
the
jilting
part
is
lost
and
all
forgotten
or
if
by
chance
it
crossed
his
happier
thought
he
rolls
and
tumbles
in
his
bed
he
raves
and
calls
upon
her
charming
name
till
he
have
quite
forgot
it
and
takes
all
the
pains
he
can
to
deceive
his
own
heart
oh
it
is
a
tender
part
and
can
endure
no
hurt
he
soothes
it
therefore
and
at
the
worst
resolves
since
the
vast
blessing
may
be
purchased
to
revel
in
delight
and
cure
himself
that
way
these
flattering
thoughts
kept
him
all
night
waking
and
in
the
morning
he
resolves
his
visit
but
taking
up
her
letter
which
lay
on
the
table
he
read
it
over
again
and
by
degrees
wrought
himself
up
to
madness
at
the
thought
that
was
possessed
he
could
bear
with
little
patience
but
that
because
before
he
loved
or
knew
her
he
could
allow
but
this
this
wrecks
his
very
soul
and
in
his
height
of
fury
he
writes
this
letter
without
consideration
octavio
sylvia
since
you
profess
yourself
a
common
mistress
and
set
up
for
the
glorious
trade
of
sin
send
me
your
price
and
i
perhaps
may
purchase
damnation
at
your
rate
may
be
you
have
a
method
in
your
dealing
and
i
have
mistook
you
all
this
while
and
dealt
not
your
way
instruct
my
youth
great
mistress
of
the
art
and
i
shall
be
obedient
tell
me
which
way
i
may
be
happy
too
and
put
in
for
an
adventurer
i
have
a
stock
of
ready
youth
and
money
pray
name
your
time
and
sum
for
hours
or
nights
or
months
i
will
be
in
at
all
or
any
as
you
shall
find
leisure
to
receive
the
impatient
this
in
a
mad
moment
he
writ
and
sent
it
ere
he
had
considered
farther
and
who
expected
not
so
coarse
and
rough
a
return
grew
as
mad
as
he
in
reading
it
and
she
had
much
ado
to
hold
her
hands
off
from
beating
the
innocent
page
that
brought
it
to
whom
she
turned
with
fire
in
her
eyes
flames
in
her
cheeks
and
thunder
on
her
tongue
and
cried
go
tell
your
master
that
he
is
a
villain
and
if
you
dare
approach
me
any
more
from
him
i
ll
have
my
footmen
whip
you
and
with
a
scorn
that
discovered
all
the
indignation
in
the
world
she
turned
from
him
and
tearing
his
note
threw
it
from
her
and
walked
her
way
and
the
page
returned
to
his
lord
who
by
this
time
was
repenting
he
had
managed
his
passion
no
better
and
at
what
the
boy
told
him
was
wholly
convinced
of
his
error
he
now
considered
her
character
and
quality
and
accused
himself
of
great
indiscretion
and
as
he
was
sitting
the
most
dejected
melancholy
man
on
earth
reflecting
on
his
misfortune
the
post
arrived
with
letters
from
which
he
opened
and
laying
by
that
which
was
enclosed
for
he
read
that
from
to
himself
philander
octavio
there
is
no
pain
my
dear
either
in
love
or
friendship
like
that
of
doubt
and
i
confess
myself
guilty
of
giving
it
you
in
a
great
measure
by
my
silence
the
last
post
but
having
business
of
so
much
greater
concern
to
my
heart
than
even
writing
to
i
found
myself
unable
to
pursue
any
other
and
i
believe
you
could
too
with
the
less
impatience
bear
with
my
neglect
having
affairs
of
the
same
nature
there
our
circumstances
and
the
business
of
our
hearts
then
being
so
resembling
methinks
i
have
as
great
an
impatience
to
be
recounting
to
you
the
story
of
my
love
and
fortune
as
i
am
to
receive
that
of
yours
and
to
know
what
advances
you
have
made
in
the
heart
of
the
still
charming
though
there
will
be
this
difference
in
the
relations
mine
whenever
i
recount
it
will
give
you
a
double
satisfaction
first
from
the
share
your
friendship
makes
you
have
in
all
the
pleasures
of
and
next
that
it
excuses
if
she
can
be
false
to
me
for
and
still
advances
his
design
on
her
heart
but
yours
whenever
i
receive
it
will
give
me
a
thousand
pains
which
it
is
however
but
just
i
should
feel
since
i
was
the
first
breaker
of
the
solemn
league
and
covenant
made
between
us
which
yet
i
do
by
all
that
is
sacred
with
a
regret
that
makes
me
reflect
with
some
repentance
in
all
those
moments
wherein
i
do
not
wholly
give
my
soul
up
to
love
and
the
more
beautiful
yes
more
because
new
in
my
last
my
dear
you
left
me
pursuing
like
a
a
beauty
enchanted
within
some
invisible
tree
or
castle
or
lake
or
any
thing
inaccessible
or
rather
wandering
in
a
dream
after
some
glorious
disappearing
phantom
and
for
some
time
indeed
i
knew
not
whether
i
slept
or
waked
i
saw
daily
the
good
old
count
of
of
whom
i
durst
not
so
much
as
ask
a
civil
question
towards
the
satisfaction
of
my
soul
the
page
was
sent
into
with
some
express
to
a
of
the
count
s
of
whom
before
i
had
the
intelligence
of
a
fair
young
wife
to
the
old
lord
his
master
and
for
the
rest
of
the
servants
they
spoke
all
and
the
devil
a
word
we
understood
each
other
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
learn
any
thing
farther
from
them
and
i
found
i
was
to
owe
all
my
good
fortune
to
my
own
industry
but
how
to
set
it
i
could
not
devise
at
last
it
happened
that
being
walking
in
the
garden
which
had
very
high
walls
on
three
sides
and
a
fine
large
apartment
on
the
other
i
concluded
that
it
was
in
that
part
of
the
house
my
fair
new
conqueress
resided
but
how
to
be
resolved
i
could
not
tell
nor
which
way
the
windows
looked
that
were
to
give
the
light
towards
that
part
of
the
garden
there
was
none
at
last
i
saw
the
good
old
gentleman
come
trudging
through
the
garden
fumbling
out
of
his
pocket
a
key
i
stepped
into
an
arbour
to
observe
him
and
saw
him
open
a
little
door
that
led
him
into
another
garden
and
locking
the
door
after
him
vanished
and
observing
how
that
side
of
the
apartment
lay
i
went
into
the
street
and
after
a
large
compass
found
that
which
faced
the
garden
which
made
the
of
the
apartment
i
made
a
story
of
some
occasion
i
had
for
some
upper
rooms
and
went
into
many
houses
to
find
which
fronted
best
the
apartment
and
still
disliked
something
till
i
met
with
one
so
directly
to
it
that
i
could
when
i
got
a
story
higher
look
into
the
very
rooms
which
only
a
delicate
garden
parted
from
this
there
it
was
i
fixed
and
learned
from
a
young
woman
that
spoke
good
that
this
was
the
very
place
i
looked
for
the
apartment
of
madam
the
countess
of
she
told
me
too
that
every
day
after
dinner
the
old
gentleman
came
thither
and
sometimes
and
bewailed
the
young
beauty
who
had
no
better
entertainment
than
what
an
old
withered
of
threescore
and
ten
could
give
her
i
found
this
young
woman
apt
for
my
purpose
and
having
very
well
pleased
her
with
my
conversation
and
some
little
presents
i
made
her
i
left
her
in
good
humour
and
resolved
to
serve
me
on
any
design
and
returning
to
my
lodging
i
found
old
returned
as
brisk
and
gay
as
if
he
had
been
caressed
by
so
fair
and
young
a
lady
which
very
thought
made
me
rave
and
i
had
abundance
of
pain
to
my
rage
from
breaking
out
upon
him
so
jealous
and
envious
was
i
of
what
now
i
loved
and
desired
a
thousand
times
more
than
ever
since
the
relation
my
new
young
female
friend
had
given
me
who
had
wit
and
beauty
sufficient
to
make
her
judgement
impartial
however
i
contained
my
jealousy
with
the
hopes
of
a
sudden
revenge
for
i
fancied
the
business
half
accomplished
in
my
knowledge
of
her
residence
i
feigned
some
business
to
the
old
gentleman
that
would
call
me
out
of
town
for
a
week
to
consult
with
some
of
our
party
and
taking
my
leave
of
him
he
offered
me
the
compliment
of
money
or
what
else
i
should
need
in
my
affair
which
at
that
time
was
not
unwelcome
to
i
me
and
being
well
furnished
for
my
enterprise
i
took
horse
without
a
page
or
footman
to
attend
me
because
i
pretended
my
business
was
a
secret
and
taking
a
turn
about
the
town
in
the
evening
i
left
my
horse
without
the
gates
and
went
to
my
secret
new
quarters
where
my
young
friend
received
me
with
the
joy
of
a
mistress
and
with
whom
indeed
i
could
not
forbear
entertaining
myself
very
well
which
engaged
her
more
to
my
service
with
the
aid
of
my
liberality
but
all
this
did
not
allay
one
spark
of
the
fire
kindled
in
my
soul
for
the
lovely
and
i
was
impatient
for
night
against
which
time
i
was
preparing
an
engine
to
mount
the
battlement
for
so
it
was
that
divided
the
garden
from
the
street
rather
than
a
wall
all
things
fitted
to
my
purpose
i
fixed
myself
at
the
window
that
looked
directly
towards
her
sashes
and
had
the
satisfaction
to
see
her
leaning
there
and
looking
on
a
fountain
that
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
garden
and
cast
a
thousand
little
streams
into
the
air
that
made
a
melancholy
noise
in
falling
into
a
large
alabaster
cistern
beneath
oh
how
my
heart
danced
at
the
dear
sight
to
all
the
tunes
of
love
i
had
not
power
to
stir
or
speak
or
to
remove
my
eyes
but
languished
on
the
window
where
i
leant
half
dead
with
joy
and
transport
for
she
appeared
more
charming
to
my
view
undressed
and
fit
for
love
oh
my
such
are
the
pangs
which
i
believe
thou
feelest
at
the
approach
of
so
beats
thy
heart
so
rise
thy
sighs
and
wishes
so
trembling
and
so
pale
at
every
view
as
i
was
in
this
lucky
amorous
moment
and
thus
i
fed
my
soul
till
night
came
on
and
left
my
eyes
no
object
but
my
heart
a
thousand
dear
ideas
and
now
i
sallied
out
and
with
good
success
for
with
a
long
engine
which
reached
the
top
of
the
wall
i
fixed
the
end
of
my
ladder
there
and
mounted
it
and
sitting
on
the
top
brought
my
ladder
easily
up
to
me
and
turned
over
to
the
other
side
and
with
abundance
of
ease
descended
into
the
garden
which
was
the
finest
i
had
ever
seen
for
now
as
good
luck
would
have
it
who
was
designed
to
favour
me
the
moon
began
to
shine
so
bright
as
even
to
make
me
distinguish
the
colours
of
the
flowers
that
dressed
all
the
banks
in
ravishing
order
but
these
were
not
the
beauty
i
came
to
possess
and
my
new
thoughts
of
disposing
myself
and
managing
my
matters
now
took
off
all
that
admiration
that
was
justly
due
to
so
delightful
a
place
which
art
and
nature
had
agreed
to
render
charming
to
every
sense
thus
much
i
considered
it
that
there
was
nothing
that
did
not
invite
to
love
a
thousand
pretty
recesses
of
arbours
grotts
and
little
artificial
groves
fountains
environed
with
beds
of
flowers
and
little
rivulets
to
whose
dear
fragrant
banks
a
wishing
amorous
god
would
make
his
soft
retreat
after
having
ranged
about
rather
to
seek
a
covert
on
occasion
and
to
know
the
passes
of
the
garden
which
might
serve
me
in
any
extremity
of
surprise
that
might
happen
i
returned
to
the
fountain
that
faced
window
and
leaning
upon
its
brink
viewed
the
whole
apartment
which
appeared
very
magnificent
just
against
me
i
perceived
a
door
that
went
into
it
which
while
i
was
considering
how
to
get
open
i
heard
it
unlock
and
skulking
behind
the
large
basin
of
the
fountain
yet
so
as
to
mark
who
came
out
i
saw
to
my
unspeakable
transport
the
fair
the
charming
dressed
just
as
she
was
at
the
window
a
loose
gown
of
silver
stuff
lapped
about
her
delicate
body
her
head
in
fine
and
all
careless
as
my
soul
could
wish
she
came
and
with
her
the
old
dragon
and
i
heard
her
say
in
coming
out
this
is
too
fine
a
night
to
sleep
in
prithee
do
not
grudge
me
the
pleasure
of
it
since
there
are
so
very
few
that
entertain
this
last
she
spoke
with
a
sigh
and
a
languishment
in
her
voice
that
shot
new
flames
of
love
into
my
panting
heart
and
trilled
through
all
my
veins
while
she
pursued
her
walk
with
the
old
gentlewoman
and
still
i
kept
myself
at
such
a
distance
to
have
them
in
my
sight
but
slid
along
the
shady
side
of
the
walk
where
i
could
not
be
easily
seen
while
they
kept
still
on
the
shiny
part
she
led
me
thus
through
all
the
walks
through
all
the
maze
of
love
and
all
the
way
i
fed
my
greedy
eyes
upon
the
melancholy
object
of
my
raving
desire
her
shape
her
gait
her
motion
every
step
and
every
movement
of
her
hand
and
head
had
a
peculiar
grace
a
thousand
times
i
was
tempted
to
approach
her
and
discover
myself
but
i
dreaded
the
fatal
consequence
the
old
woman
being
by
nor
knew
i
whether
they
did
not
expect
the
husband
there
i
therefore
waited
with
impatience
when
she
would
speak
that
by
that
i
might
make
some
discovery
of
my
destiny
that
night
and
after
having
tired
herself
a
little
with
walking
she
sat
down
on
a
fine
seat
of
white
marble
that
was
placed
at
the
end
of
a
grassy
walk
and
only
shadowed
with
some
tall
trees
that
ranked
themselves
behind
it
against
one
of
which
i
leaned
there
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
sat
as
silent
as
the
night
where
only
winds
were
heard
amongst
the
boughs
and
softer
sighs
from
fair
at
last
the
old
thing
broke
silence
who
was
almost
asleep
while
she
spoke
if
you
are
weary
let
us
retire
to
bed
and
not
sit
gazing
here
at
the
to
bed
replied
what
should
i
do
there
marry
sleep
quoth
the
old
gentlewoman
what
should
you
do
ah
sighed
would
age
would
seize
me
too
for
then
perhaps
i
should
find
at
least
the
pleasure
of
the
old
be
dull
and
lazy
love
to
eat
and
sleep
not
have
my
slumbers
disturbed
with
dreams
more
insupportable
than
my
waking
wishes
for
reason
then
suppresses
rising
thoughts
and
the
impossibility
of
obtaining
keeps
the
fond
soul
in
order
but
sleep
gives
an
unguarded
loose
to
soft
desire
it
brings
the
lovely
phantom
to
my
view
and
tempts
me
with
a
thousand
charms
to
love
i
see
a
face
a
mien
a
shape
a
look
such
as
heaven
never
made
or
any
thing
but
fond
imagination
oh
it
was
a
wondrous
vision
for
my
part
replied
the
old
one
i
am
such
a
heathen
christian
madam
as
i
do
not
believe
there
are
any
such
things
as
visions
or
ghosts
or
phantoms
but
your
head
runs
of
a
young
man
because
you
are
married
to
an
old
one
such
an
idea
as
you
framed
in
your
wishes
possessed
your
fancy
which
was
so
strong
as
indeed
fancy
will
be
sometimes
that
it
persuaded
you
it
was
a
very
phantom
or
let
it
be
fancy
or
vision
or
whatever
else
you
can
give
a
name
to
replied
still
it
is
that
that
never
ceased
since
to
torture
me
with
a
thousand
pains
and
prithee
why
is
not
fancy
since
as
powerful
in
me
as
it
was
before
fancy
has
not
been
since
so
kind
yet
i
have
given
it
room
for
thought
which
before
i
never
did
i
sat
whole
hours
and
days
and
fixed
my
soul
upon
the
lovely
figure
i
know
its
stature
to
an
inch
tall
and
divinely
made
i
saw
his
hair
long
black
and
curling
to
his
waist
all
loose
and
flowing
i
saw
his
eyes
where
all
the
played
black
large
and
sparkling
piercing
loving
languishing
i
saw
his
lips
sweet
dimpled
red
and
soft
a
youth
complete
in
all
like
early
that
looks
and
smells
and
cheers
above
the
rest
in
fine
i
saw
him
such
as
nothing
but
the
nicest
fancy
can
imagine
and
nothing
can
describe
i
saw
him
such
as
robs
me
of
my
rest
as
gives
me
all
the
raging
pains
of
love
love
i
believe
it
is
without
the
joy
of
any
single
oh
madam
said
that
love
will
quickly
die
which
is
not
nursed
with
hope
why
that
is
its
only
pray
heaven
i
find
it
so
replied
at
that
she
sighed
as
if
her
heart
had
broken
and
leaned
her
arm
upon
a
rail
of
the
end
of
the
seat
and
laid
her
lovely
cheek
upon
her
hand
and
so
continued
without
speaking
while
i
who
was
not
a
little
transported
with
what
i
heard
with
infinite
pain
myself
from
kneeling
at
her
feet
and
prostrating
before
her
that
happy
phantom
of
which
she
had
spoke
so
favourably
but
still
i
feared
my
fate
and
to
give
any
offence
while
i
was
amidst
a
thousand
thoughts
considering
which
to
pursue
i
could
hear
snoring
as
fast
as
could
be
leaning
at
her
ease
on
the
other
end
of
the
seat
supported
by
a
wide
marble
rail
which
hearing
also
turned
and
looked
on
her
then
softly
rose
and
walked
away
to
see
how
long
she
would
sleep
there
if
not
waked
judge
now
my
dear
whether
love
and
fortune
were
not
absolutely
subdued
to
my
interest
and
if
all
things
did
not
favour
my
design
the
very
thought
of
being
alone
with
of
making
myself
known
to
her
of
the
opportunity
she
gave
me
by
going
from
into
a
the
very
joy
of
ten
thousand
hopes
that
filled
my
soul
in
that
happy
moment
which
i
fancied
the
most
blessed
of
my
life
made
me
tremble
all
over
and
with
unassured
steps
i
softly
pursued
the
object
of
my
new
desire
sometimes
i
even
overtook
her
and
fearing
to
fright
her
and
cause
her
to
make
some
noise
that
might
alarm
the
sleeping
i
slackened
my
pace
till
in
a
walk
at
the
end
of
which
she
was
obliged
to
turn
back
i
remained
and
suffered
her
to
go
on
it
was
a
walk
of
grass
broad
and
at
the
end
of
it
a
little
arbour
of
greens
into
which
she
went
and
sat
down
looking
towards
me
and
methought
she
looked
full
at
me
so
that
finding
she
made
no
noise
i
softly
approached
the
door
of
the
arbour
at
a
convenient
distance
she
then
stood
up
in
great
amaze
as
she
after
said
and
i
kneeling
down
in
an
humble
posture
cried
wonder
not
oh
sacred
charmer
of
my
soul
to
see
me
at
your
feet
at
this
late
hour
and
in
a
place
so
inaccessible
for
what
attempt
is
there
so
hazardous
despairing
lovers
dare
not
undertake
and
what
impossibility
almost
can
they
not
overcome
remove
your
fears
oh
conqueress
of
my
soul
for
i
am
an
humble
mortal
that
adores
you
i
have
a
thousand
wounds
a
thousand
pains
that
prove
me
flesh
and
blood
if
you
would
hear
my
story
oh
give
me
leave
to
approach
you
with
that
awe
you
do
the
sacred
altars
for
my
devotion
is
as
pure
as
that
which
from
your
charming
lips
ascends
the
heavens
with
such
cant
and
stuff
as
this
which
lovers
serve
themselves
with
on
occasion
i
lessened
the
terrors
of
the
frighted
beauty
and
she
soon
saw
with
joy
in
her
eyes
that
i
both
was
a
mortal
and
the
same
she
had
before
seen
in
the
outward
garden
i
rose
from
my
knees
then
and
with
a
joy
that
wandered
all
over
my
body
trembling
and
panting
i
approached
her
and
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
with
a
transport
that
was
almost
ready
to
lay
me
fainting
at
her
feet
nor
did
she
answer
any
thing
to
what
i
had
said
but
with
sighs
suffered
her
hand
to
remain
in
mine
her
eyes
she
cast
to
earth
her
breast
heaved
with
nimble
motions
and
we
both
unable
to
support
ourselves
sat
down
together
on
a
green
bank
in
the
arbour
where
by
the
light
we
had
we
gazed
at
each
other
unable
to
utter
a
syllable
on
either
side
i
confess
my
dear
i
have
felt
love
before
but
do
not
know
that
ever
i
was
possessed
with
such
pleasing
pain
such
agreeable
languishment
in
all
my
life
as
in
those
happy
moments
with
the
fair
and
on
the
other
i
dare
answer
for
the
soft
fair
one
she
felt
a
passion
as
tender
as
mine
which
when
she
could
recover
her
first
transport
she
expressed
in
such
a
manner
as
has
wholly
charmed
me
for
with
all
the
eloquence
of
young
angels
and
all
their
innocence
too
she
said
she
whispered
she
sighed
the
softest
things
that
ever
lover
heard
i
told
you
before
she
had
from
her
infancy
been
bred
in
a
monastery
kept
from
the
sight
of
men
and
knew
no
one
art
or
subtlety
of
her
sex
but
in
the
very
purity
of
her
innocence
she
appeared
like
the
maid
in
paradise
generously
giving
her
soul
away
to
the
great
lord
of
all
the
man
and
nothing
of
her
heart
s
dear
thoughts
she
did
reserve
but
such
as
modest
nature
should
conceal
yet
if
i
touched
but
on
that
tender
part
where
honour
dwelt
she
had
a
sense
too
nice
as
it
was
a
wonder
to
find
so
vast
a
store
of
that
mixed
with
so
soft
a
passion
oh
what
an
excellent
thing
a
perfect
woman
is
ere
man
has
taught
her
arts
to
keep
her
empire
by
being
himself
inconstant
all
i
could
ask
of
love
she
freely
gave
and
told
me
every
sentiment
of
her
heart
but
it
was
in
such
a
way
so
innocently
she
confessed
her
passion
that
every
word
added
new
flames
to
mine
and
made
me
raging
mad
at
last
she
suffered
me
to
kiss
with
caution
but
one
begat
another
that
a
number
and
every
one
was
an
advance
to
happiness
and
i
who
knew
my
advantage
lost
no
time
but
put
each
minute
to
the
properest
use
now
i
embrace
clasp
her
fair
lovely
body
close
to
mine
which
nothing
parted
but
her
shift
and
gown
my
busy
hands
find
passage
to
her
breasts
and
give
and
take
a
thousand
nameless
joys
all
but
the
last
i
reaped
that
heaven
was
still
denied
though
she
were
fainting
in
my
trembling
arms
still
she
had
watching
sense
to
guard
that
treasure
yet
in
spite
of
all
a
thousand
times
i
brought
her
to
the
very
point
of
yielding
but
oh
she
begs
and
pleads
with
all
the
eloquence
of
love
tells
me
that
what
she
had
to
give
me
she
gave
but
would
not
violate
her
no
not
to
save
that
life
she
found
in
danger
with
too
much
love
and
too
extreme
desire
she
told
me
that
i
had
undone
her
quite
she
sighed
and
wished
that
she
had
seen
me
sooner
ere
fate
had
rendered
her
a
sacrifice
to
the
embraces
of
old
she
wept
with
love
and
answered
with
a
sob
to
every
vow
i
made
thus
by
degrees
she
wrought
me
to
undoing
and
made
me
mad
in
love
it
was
thus
we
passed
the
night
we
told
the
hasty
hours
and
cursed
their
coming
we
told
from
ten
to
three
and
all
that
time
seemed
but
a
little
minute
nor
would
i
let
her
go
who
was
as
loath
to
part
till
she
had
given
me
leave
to
see
her
often
there
i
told
her
all
my
story
of
her
conquest
and
how
i
came
into
the
garden
she
asked
me
pleasantly
if
i
were
not
afraid
of
old
i
told
her
no
of
nothing
but
of
his
being
happy
with
her
which
thought
i
could
not
bear
she
assured
me
i
had
so
little
reason
to
envy
him
that
he
rather
deserved
my
compassion
for
that
her
aversion
was
so
extreme
to
him
his
person
years
his
temper
and
his
diseases
were
so
disagreeable
to
her
that
she
could
not
dissemble
her
disgust
but
gave
him
most
evident
proofs
of
it
too
frequently
ever
since
she
had
the
misfortune
of
being
his
wife
but
that
since
she
had
seen
the
charming
for
so
we
must
let
her
call
him
too
his
company
and
conversation
was
wholly
insupportable
to
her
and
but
that
he
had
ever
used
to
let
her
have
four
nights
in
the
week
her
own
wherein
he
never
disturbed
her
repose
she
should
have
been
dead
with
his
nasty
entertainment
she
vowed
she
never
knew
a
soft
desire
but
for
she
never
had
the
least
concern
for
any
of
his
sex
besides
and
till
she
felt
his
touches
took
in
his
kisses
and
suffered
his
dear
embraces
she
never
knew
that
woman
was
ordained
for
any
joy
with
man
but
fancied
it
designed
in
its
creation
for
a
poor
slave
to
be
oppressed
at
pleasure
by
the
husband
dully
to
yield
obedience
and
no
more
but
i
had
taught
her
now
she
said
to
her
eternal
ruin
that
there
was
more
in
nature
than
she
knew
or
ever
should
had
she
not
seen
she
knew
not
what
dear
name
to
call
it
by
but
something
in
her
blood
something
that
panted
in
her
heart
glowed
in
her
cheeks
and
languished
in
her
looks
told
her
she
was
not
born
for
or
love
would
do
her
wrong
i
soothed
the
thought
and
urged
the
laws
of
nature
the
power
of
love
necessity
of
youth
and
the
wonder
that
was
yet
behind
that
ravishing
something
which
not
love
or
kisses
could
make
her
guess
at
so
beyond
all
soft
imagination
that
nothing
but
a
trial
could
convince
her
but
she
resisted
still
and
still
i
pleaded
with
all
the
subtlest
arguments
of
love
words
mixed
with
kisses
sighing
mixed
with
vows
but
all
in
vain
religion
was
my
foe
and
tyrant
honour
guarded
all
her
charms
thus
did
we
pass
the
night
till
the
young
morn
advancing
in
the
east
forced
us
to
bid
adieu
which
oft
we
did
and
oft
we
sighed
and
kissed
oft
parted
and
returned
and
sighed
again
and
as
she
went
away
she
weeping
cried
wringing
my
hand
in
hers
pray
heaven
this
dear
interview
do
not
prove
fatal
to
me
for
oh
i
find
frail
nature
weak
about
me
and
one
dear
minute
more
would
forfeit
all
my
at
this
she
started
from
my
trembling
hand
and
swept
the
walk
like
wind
so
swift
and
sudden
and
left
me
panting
sighing
wishing
dying
with
mighty
love
and
hope
and
after
a
little
time
i
scaled
my
wall
and
returned
unseen
to
my
new
lodging
it
was
four
days
after
before
i
could
get
any
other
happiness
but
that
of
seeing
her
at
her
window
which
was
just
against
mine
from
which
i
never
stirred
hardly
to
eat
or
sleep
and
that
she
saw
with
joy
for
every
morning
i
had
a
billet
from
her
which
we
contrived
that
happy
night
should
be
conveyed
me
thus
it
was
a
where
i
lodged
and
the
other
side
was
only
the
dead
wall
of
her
garden
where
early
in
the
morning
she
used
to
walk
and
having
the
billet
ready
she
put
it
with
a
stone
into
a
little
and
tossed
it
over
the
wall
where
either
myself
from
the
window
or
my
young
friend
below
waited
for
it
and
that
way
every
morning
and
every
evening
she
received
one
from
me
but
impossible
to
tell
you
the
innocent
passion
she
expressed
in
them
innocent
in
that
there
was
no
art
no
feigned
nice
folly
to
express
a
virtue
that
was
not
in
the
soul
but
all
she
spoke
confessed
her
heart
s
soft
wishes
at
last
for
i
am
tedious
in
a
relation
of
what
gave
me
so
much
pleasure
in
the
entertainment
at
last
i
say
i
received
the
happy
invitation
to
come
into
the
garden
as
before
and
night
advancing
for
my
purpose
i
need
not
say
that
i
delivered
myself
upon
the
place
appointed
which
was
by
the
beneath
her
towards
which
i
cast
you
may
believe
many
a
longing
look
the
clock
struck
ten
eleven
and
then
twelve
but
no
dear
star
appeared
to
conduct
me
to
my
happiness
at
last
i
heard
the
little
against
the
fountain
open
and
saw
there
wrapped
in
her
only
i
ran
like
lightning
to
her
arms
with
all
the
transports
of
an
eager
lover
and
almost
smothered
myself
in
her
warm
rising
breast
for
she
taking
me
in
her
arms
let
go
her
gown
which
falling
open
left
nothing
but
her
shift
between
me
and
all
her
charming
body
but
she
bid
me
hear
what
she
had
to
say
before
i
proceeded
farther
she
told
me
she
was
forced
to
wait
till
was
asleep
who
lay
in
her
chamber
and
then
stealing
the
key
she
came
softly
down
to
let
me
in
but
said
she
since
i
am
all
undressed
and
can
not
walk
in
the
garden
with
you
will
you
promise
me
on
love
and
honour
to
be
obedient
to
all
my
commands
if
i
carry
you
to
my
chamber
for
sleep
is
like
death
itself
however
lest
she
chance
to
awake
and
should
take
an
occasion
to
speak
to
me
it
were
absolutely
necessary
that
i
were
there
for
since
i
served
her
such
a
trick
the
other
night
and
let
her
sleep
so
long
she
will
not
let
me
walk
a
very
little
argument
persuaded
me
to
yield
to
any
thing
to
be
with
any
where
so
that
both
returning
softly
to
her
chamber
she
put
herself
into
bed
and
left
me
kneeling
on
the
carpet
but
it
was
not
long
that
i
remained
so
from
the
dear
touches
of
her
hands
and
breast
we
came
to
kisses
and
so
equally
to
a
forgetfulness
of
all
we
had
promised
and
agreed
on
before
and
broke
all
rules
and
articles
that
were
not
in
the
favour
of
love
so
that
stripping
myself
by
degrees
while
she
with
an
unwilling
force
made
some
feeble
resistance
i
got
into
the
arms
of
the
most
charming
woman
that
ever
nature
made
she
was
all
over
perfection
i
dare
not
tell
you
more
let
it
suffice
she
was
all
that
luxurious
man
could
wish
and
all
that
renders
woman
fine
and
ravishing
about
two
hours
thus
was
my
soul
in
rapture
while
sometimes
she
reproached
me
but
so
gently
that
it
was
to
bid
me
still
be
false
and
perjured
if
these
were
the
effects
of
it
if
disobedience
have
such
wondrous
charms
may
i
said
she
be
still
commanding
thee
and
thou
still
while
thus
we
lay
with
equal
ravishment
we
heard
a
murmuring
noise
at
a
distance
which
we
knew
not
what
to
make
of
but
it
grew
still
louder
and
louder
but
still
at
a
distance
too
this
first
alarmed
us
and
i
was
no
sooner
persuaded
to
rise
but
i
heard
a
door
unlock
at
the
side
of
the
bed
which
was
not
that
by
which
i
entered
for
that
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
chamber
towards
the
window
oh
heavens
said
the
fair
frighted
trembler
here
is
the
count
of
for
he
always
came
up
that
way
and
those
stairs
by
which
i
ascended
were
the
so
that
i
had
just
time
to
grope
my
way
towards
the
door
without
so
much
as
taking
my
clothes
with
me
never
was
any
amorous
adventurer
in
so
lamentable
a
condition
i
would
fain
have
turned
upon
him
and
at
once
have
hindered
him
from
entering
with
my
sword
in
my
hand
and
secured
him
from
ever
disturbing
my
pleasure
any
more
but
she
implored
i
would
not
and
in
this
minute
s
dispute
he
came
so
near
me
that
he
touched
me
as
i
glided
from
him
but
not
being
acquainted
very
well
with
the
chamber
having
never
seen
my
way
i
lighted
in
my
passage
on
and
threw
myself
quite
over
her
to
the
which
made
a
damnable
clattering
and
awaking
with
my
catastrophe
she
set
up
such
a
bawl
as
frighted
and
alarmed
the
old
count
who
was
just
taking
in
a
candle
from
his
footman
who
had
lighted
it
at
his
flambeau
so
that
hearing
the
noise
and
knowing
it
must
be
some
body
in
the
chamber
he
let
fall
his
candle
in
the
fright
and
called
his
footman
in
with
the
flambeau
draws
his
toledo
which
he
had
in
his
hand
and
wrapped
in
his
with
three
or
four
woollen
caps
one
upon
the
top
of
another
tied
under
his
tawny
leathern
chops
he
made
a
very
pleasant
figure
and
such
a
one
as
had
like
to
have
betrayed
me
by
laughing
at
it
he
closely
pursued
me
though
not
so
close
as
to
see
me
before
him
yet
so
as
not
to
give
me
time
to
ascend
the
wall
or
to
make
my
escape
up
or
down
any
walk
which
were
straight
and
long
and
not
able
to
conceal
any
body
from
pursuers
approached
so
near
as
the
count
was
to
me
what
should
i
do
i
was
naked
unarmed
and
no
defence
against
his
jealous
rage
and
now
in
danger
of
my
life
i
knew
not
what
to
resolve
on
yet
i
swear
to
you
even
in
that
minute
which
i
thought
my
last
i
had
no
repentance
of
the
dear
sin
or
any
other
fear
but
that
which
possessed
me
for
the
fair
and
calling
upon
and
her
son
for
my
safety
for
i
had
scarce
a
thought
yet
of
any
other
deity
the
queen
lent
me
immediate
aid
and
ere
i
was
aware
of
it
i
touched
the
fountain
and
in
the
same
minute
threw
myself
into
the
water
which
a
mighty
large
basin
or
cistern
of
white
marble
contained
of
a
compass
that
forty
men
might
have
hid
themselves
in
it
they
had
pursued
me
so
hard
they
fancied
they
heard
me
press
the
gravel
near
the
fountain
and
with
the
torch
they
searched
round
about
it
and
beat
the
fringing
flowers
that
grew
pretty
high
about
the
bottom
of
it
while
i
sometimes
dived
and
sometimes
peeped
up
to
take
a
view
of
my
busy
coxcomb
who
had
like
to
have
made
me
burst
into
laughter
many
times
to
see
his
figure
the
dashing
of
the
stream
which
continually
fell
from
the
little
pipes
above
in
the
basin
hindered
him
from
hearing
the
noise
i
might
possibly
have
made
by
my
swimming
in
it
after
he
had
surveyed
it
round
he
took
the
torch
in
his
own
hand
and
surveyed
the
water
itself
while
i
dived
and
so
long
forced
to
remain
so
that
i
believed
i
had
escaped
his
sword
to
die
that
foolisher
way
but
just
as
i
was
like
to
expire
he
departed
muttering
that
he
was
sure
some
body
did
go
out
before
him
and
now
he
searched
every
walk
and
arbour
of
the
garden
while
like
a
fish
i
lay
basking
in
element
still
not
daring
to
adventure
out
lest
his
hasty
return
should
find
me
on
the
wall
or
in
my
passage
over
i
thanked
my
stars
he
had
not
found
the
ladder
so
that
at
last
returning
to
chamber
after
finding
no
body
he
desired
as
i
heard
the
next
morning
to
know
what
the
matter
was
in
her
chamber
but
who
till
now
never
knew
an
art
had
before
he
came
laid
her
bed
in
order
and
taken
up
my
clothes
and
put
them
between
her
bed
and
quilt
not
forgetting
any
one
thing
that
belonged
to
me
she
was
laid
as
fast
asleep
as
innocence
itself
so
that
awaking
her
she
seemed
as
surprised
and
ignorant
of
all
as
if
she
had
indeed
been
innocent
so
that
now
remained
the
only
suspected
person
who
being
asked
what
she
could
say
concerning
that
uproar
she
made
she
only
said
as
she
thought
that
she
dreamed
his
honour
fell
out
of
the
bed
upon
her
and
awaking
in
a
fright
she
found
it
was
but
a
dream
and
so
she
fell
asleep
again
till
he
awaked
her
whom
she
wondered
to
see
there
at
that
hour
he
told
them
that
while
they
were
securely
sleeping
he
was
like
to
have
been
burned
in
his
bed
a
piece
of
his
apartment
being
burned
down
which
caused
him
to
come
thither
but
he
made
them
both
swear
that
there
was
no
body
in
the
chamber
of
before
he
would
be
undeceived
for
he
vowed
he
saw
something
in
the
garden
which
to
his
thinking
was
all
white
and
it
vanished
on
the
sudden
behind
the
fountain
and
we
could
see
no
more
of
it
dissembled
abundance
of
fear
and
said
she
would
never
walk
after
candlelight
for
fear
of
that
ghost
and
so
they
passed
the
rest
of
the
night
while
i
all
wet
and
cold
got
me
to
my
lodging
unperceived
for
my
young
friend
had
left
the
door
open
for
me
thus
dear
i
have
sent
you
a
novel
instead
of
a
letter
of
my
first
most
happy
adventure
of
which
i
must
repeat
thus
much
again
that
of
all
the
enjoyments
i
ever
had
i
was
never
so
perfectly
well
entertained
for
two
hours
and
i
am
waiting
with
infinite
patience
for
a
second
encounter
i
shall
be
extremely
glad
to
hear
what
progress
you
have
made
in
your
amour
for
i
have
lost
all
for
but
the
affection
of
a
brother
with
that
natural
pity
we
have
for
those
we
have
undone
for
my
heart
my
soul
and
body
are
all
the
bright
the
young
the
witty
the
gay
the
only
some
reserve
i
have
in
all
for
pardon
this
long
history
for
it
is
a
sort
of
acting
all
one
s
joys
again
to
be
telling
them
to
a
friend
so
dear
as
is
the
gallant
to
philander
postscript
should
for
some
reasons
that
concern
my
safety
have
quitted
his
town
before
but
i
am
chained
to
it
and
no
sense
of
danger
calista
my
if
trouble
was
great
before
from
but
his
fear
of
yielding
what
must
it
be
now
when
he
found
all
his
fears
confirmed
the
pressures
of
his
soul
were
too
extreme
before
and
the
concern
he
had
for
had
brought
it
to
the
highest
tide
of
grief
so
that
this
addition
overwhelmed
it
quite
and
left
him
no
room
for
rage
no
it
could
not
discharge
itself
so
happily
but
bowed
and
yielded
to
all
the
extremes
of
love
grief
and
sense
of
honour
he
threw
himself
upon
his
bed
and
lay
without
sense
or
motion
for
a
whole
hour
confused
with
thought
and
divided
in
his
concern
half
for
a
mistress
false
and
half
for
a
sister
loose
and
undone
by
turns
the
sister
and
the
mistress
torture
by
turns
they
break
his
heart
he
had
this
comfort
left
before
that
if
were
undone
her
ruin
made
way
for
his
love
and
happiness
with
but
now
he
had
no
prospect
left
that
could
afford
any
ease
he
changes
from
one
sad
object
to
another
from
to
then
back
to
but
like
to
feverish
men
that
toss
about
here
and
there
remove
for
some
relief
he
shifts
but
to
new
pain
wherever
he
turns
he
finds
the
madman
still
in
this
distraction
of
thought
he
remained
till
a
page
from
brought
him
this
letter
which
in
midst
of
all
he
started
from
his
bed
with
excess
of
joy
and
read
sylvia
octavio
after
your
last
affront
by
your
page
i
believe
it
will
surprise
you
to
receive
any
thing
from
but
scorn
and
disdain
but
my
lord
the
interest
you
have
by
a
thousand
ways
been
so
long
making
in
my
heart
can
not
so
soon
be
cancelled
by
a
minute
s
offence
and
every
action
of
your
life
has
been
too
generous
to
make
me
think
you
writ
what
i
have
received
at
least
you
are
not
well
in
your
senses
i
have
committed
a
fault
against
your
love
i
must
confess
and
am
not
ashamed
of
the
little
cheat
i
put
upon
you
in
bringing
you
to
bed
to
instead
of
i
was
ashamed
to
be
so
easily
won
and
took
it
ill
your
passion
was
so
mercenary
to
ask
so
coarsely
for
the
possession
of
me
too
great
a
pay
i
thought
for
so
poor
service
as
rendering
up
a
letter
which
in
honour
you
ought
before
to
have
shewed
me
i
own
i
gave
you
hope
in
that
too
i
was
criminal
but
these
are
faults
that
sure
deserved
a
kinder
punishment
than
what
i
last
received
a
whore
a
common
mistress
death
you
are
a
coward
and
even
to
a
woman
dare
not
say
it
when
she
confronts
the
scandaler
yet
pardon
me
i
mean
not
to
revile
but
gently
to
reproach
it
was
unkind
at
least
allow
me
that
and
much
unlike
i
think
i
had
not
troubled
you
my
lord
with
the
least
confession
of
my
resentment
but
i
could
not
leave
the
town
where
for
the
honour
of
your
conversation
and
friendship
alone
i
have
remained
so
long
without
acquitting
myself
of
those
obligations
i
had
to
you
i
send
you
therefore
the
key
of
my
closet
and
cabinet
where
you
shall
find
not
only
your
letters
but
all
those
presents
you
have
been
pleased
once
to
think
me
worthy
of
but
having
taken
back
your
friendship
i
render
you
the
less
valuable
trifles
and
will
retain
no
more
of
than
the
dear
memory
of
that
part
of
his
life
that
was
so
agreeable
to
the
unfortunate
sylvia
he
reading
this
letter
finished
with
tears
of
tender
love
but
considering
it
all
over
he
fancied
she
had
put
great
constraint
upon
her
natural
high
spirit
to
write
in
this
calm
manner
to
him
and
through
all
he
found
dissembled
rage
which
yet
was
visible
in
that
one
breaking
out
in
the
middle
of
the
letter
he
found
she
was
not
able
to
contain
at
the
word
common
mistress
in
fine
however
calm
it
was
and
however
designed
he
found
and
at
least
he
thought
he
found
the
charming
jilt
all
over
he
fancies
from
the
hint
she
gave
him
of
the
change
of
for
herself
in
bed
that
it
was
some
new
cheat
that
was
to
be
put
upon
him
and
to
bring
herself
off
with
credit
yet
in
spite
of
all
this
appearing
reason
he
wishes
and
has
a
secret
hope
that
either
she
is
not
in
fault
or
that
she
will
so
cozen
him
into
a
belief
she
is
not
that
it
may
serve
as
well
to
soothe
his
willing
heart
and
now
all
he
fears
is
that
she
will
not
put
so
neat
a
cheat
upon
him
but
that
he
shall
be
able
to
see
through
it
and
still
be
obliged
to
retain
his
ill
opinion
of
her
but
love
returned
she
had
roused
the
flame
anew
and
softened
all
his
rougher
thoughts
with
this
dear
letter
and
now
in
haste
he
calls
for
his
clothes
and
suffering
himself
to
be
dressed
with
all
the
advantage
of
his
sex
he
throws
himself
into
his
coach
and
goes
to
whom
he
finds
just
dressed
and
setting
her
head
and
feather
in
good
order
before
the
glass
with
a
design
to
depart
the
town
at
least
so
far
as
should
have
raised
a
concern
in
if
yet
he
had
any
for
her
to
have
followed
her
he
ran
up
without
asking
leave
into
her
chamber
and
ere
she
was
aware
of
him
he
threw
himself
at
her
feet
and
clasping
her
knees
to
which
he
fixed
his
mouth
he
remained
there
for
a
little
space
without
life
or
motion
and
pressed
her
in
his
arms
as
fast
as
a
dying
man
she
was
not
offended
to
see
him
there
and
he
appeared
more
lovely
than
ever
he
yet
had
been
his
grief
had
added
a
languishment
and
paleness
to
his
face
which
sufficiently
told
her
he
had
not
been
at
ease
while
absent
from
her
and
on
the
other
side
appeared
ten
thousand
times
more
charming
than
ever
the
dress
of
a
boy
adding
extremely
to
her
beauty
you
are
a
pretty
lover
said
she
raising
him
from
her
knees
to
her
arms
to
treat
a
mistress
so
for
a
little
innocent
come
sit
and
tell
me
how
you
came
to
discover
the
harmless
cheat
setting
him
down
on
the
side
of
her
bed
oh
name
it
no
more
cried
he
let
that
damned
night
be
blotted
from
the
year
deceive
me
flatter
me
say
you
are
innocent
tell
me
my
senses
rave
my
eyes
were
false
deceitful
and
my
ears
were
deaf
say
any
thing
that
may
convince
my
madness
and
bring
me
back
to
tame
adoring
means
replied
sure
he
is
not
so
nice
and
squeamish
a
lover
but
a
fair
young
maid
might
have
been
welcome
to
him
coming
so
prepared
for
love
though
it
was
not
she
whom
he
expected
it
might
have
served
as
well
in
the
dark
at
least
well
said
replied
forcing
a
smile
advance
pursue
the
dear
design
and
cheat
me
still
and
to
convince
my
soul
oh
swear
it
too
for
women
want
no
weapons
of
defence
oaths
vows
and
tears
sighs
imprecations
ravings
are
all
the
tools
to
fashion
mankind
coxcombs
i
am
an
easy
fellow
fit
for
use
and
long
to
be
initiated
fool
come
swear
i
was
not
here
the
other
it
is
granted
sir
you
were
why
all
this
passion
this
spoke
and
took
him
by
the
hand
which
burnt
with
raging
fire
and
though
he
spoke
with
all
the
heat
of
love
his
looks
were
soft
the
while
as
infant
still
he
proceeded
oh
charming
since
you
are
so
unkind
to
tell
me
truth
cease
cease
to
speak
at
all
and
let
me
only
gaze
upon
those
eyes
that
can
so
well
deceive
their
looks
are
innocent
at
least
they
will
flatter
me
and
tell
mine
they
lost
their
faculties
that
other
no
replied
i
am
convinced
they
did
not
you
saw
conduct
a
happy
man
interrupted
he
to
bed
oh
why
by
your
confession
must
my
soul
be
tortured
over
anew
at
this
he
hung
his
head
upon
his
bosom
and
sighed
as
if
each
breath
would
be
his
last
heavens
cried
what
is
it
says
conduct
a
happy
lover
to
my
bed
by
all
that
is
sacred
i
am
abused
designed
upon
to
be
betrayed
and
lost
what
said
you
sir
a
lover
to
my
bed
when
he
replied
in
a
fainting
tone
clasping
her
to
his
arms
now
you
are
kind
be
perfect
woman
and
keep
to
cozening
still
now
back
it
with
a
very
little
oath
and
i
am
as
well
as
before
i
saw
your
falsehood
and
never
will
lose
one
thought
upon
it
forbear
said
she
you
will
make
me
angry
in
short
what
is
it
you
would
say
or
swear
you
rave
and
then
i
will
pity
what
i
now
despise
if
you
can
think
me
he
only
answered
with
a
sigh
and
she
pursued
i
not
worth
an
answer
tell
me
your
soul
and
thoughts
as
ever
you
hope
for
favour
from
my
love
or
to
preserve
my
if
you
will
promise
me
to
say
it
is
false
replied
he
softly
i
will
confess
the
errors
of
my
senses
i
came
the
other
night
at
twelve
the
door
was
it
is
true
said
at
the
i
found
a
man
and
saw
him
led
to
you
into
your
chamber
sighing
as
he
went
and
panting
with
impatience
now
if
you
value
my
repose
my
life
my
reputation
or
my
services
turn
it
off
handsomely
and
i
am
at
that
being
wholly
amazed
she
told
him
the
whole
story
as
you
heard
of
her
dressing
and
bringing
him
to
her
at
which
he
smiled
and
begged
her
to
go
on
she
fetched
the
pieces
of
counterfeit
letters
and
shewed
him
this
brought
him
a
little
to
his
wits
and
at
first
sight
he
was
ready
to
fancy
the
letters
came
indeed
from
him
he
found
the
character
his
but
not
his
business
and
in
great
amaze
replied
ah
madam
did
you
know
soul
so
well
and
could
you
imagine
it
capable
of
a
thought
like
this
a
presumption
so
daring
to
the
most
awful
of
her
sex
this
was
unkind
indeed
and
did
you
answer
them
yes
replied
she
with
all
the
kindness
i
could
force
my
pen
to
so
that
after
canvassing
the
matter
and
relating
the
whole
story
again
with
his
being
taken
ill
they
concluded
from
every
circumstance
was
the
man
for
was
called
to
council
who
now
recollecting
all
things
in
her
mind
and
knowing
but
too
well
she
confessed
she
verily
believed
it
was
he
especially
when
she
told
how
she
stole
a
letter
of
for
him
that
day
and
how
he
was
ill
of
the
same
disease
still
then
called
his
page
and
sent
him
home
for
the
note
had
sent
him
and
all
appeared
as
clear
as
day
but
met
with
a
great
many
reproaches
for
shewing
her
lady
s
letters
which
she
excused
as
well
as
she
could
but
never
was
man
so
ravished
with
joy
as
was
at
the
knowledge
of
innocence
a
thousand
times
he
kneeled
and
begged
her
pardon
and
her
figure
encouraging
his
caresses
a
thousand
times
he
embraced
her
he
smiled
and
blushed
and
sighed
with
love
and
joy
and
knew
not
how
to
express
it
most
effectually
and
who
had
other
business
than
love
in
her
heart
and
head
suffered
all
the
marks
of
his
eager
passion
and
transport
out
of
design
for
she
had
a
farther
use
to
make
of
though
when
she
surveyed
his
person
handsome
young
and
adorned
with
all
the
graces
and
beauties
of
the
sex
not
at
all
inferior
to
if
not
exceeding
in
every
judgement
but
that
of
when
she
considered
his
soul
where
wit
love
and
honour
equally
reigned
when
she
consults
the
excellence
of
his
nature
his
generosity
courage
friendship
and
softness
she
sighed
and
cried
it
was
pity
to
impose
upon
him
and
make
his
love
for
which
she
should
esteem
him
a
property
to
draw
him
to
his
ruin
for
so
she
fancied
it
must
be
if
ever
he
encountered
and
though
good
nature
was
the
least
ingredient
that
formed
the
soul
of
this
fair
charmer
yet
now
she
found
she
had
a
mixture
of
it
from
her
concern
for
and
that
generous
lover
made
her
so
many
soft
vows
and
tender
protestations
of
the
respect
and
awfulness
of
his
passion
that
she
was
wholly
convinced
he
was
her
slave
nor
could
she
see
the
constant
languisher
pouring
out
his
soul
and
fortune
at
her
feet
without
suffering
some
warmth
about
her
heart
which
she
had
never
felt
but
for
and
this
day
she
expressed
herself
more
obligingly
than
ever
she
had
done
and
allows
him
little
freedoms
of
approaching
her
with
more
softness
than
hitherto
she
had
and
absolutely
charmed
he
promises
lavishly
and
without
reserve
all
she
would
ask
of
him
and
in
requital
she
assured
him
all
he
could
wish
or
hope
if
he
would
serve
her
in
her
revenge
against
she
recounts
to
him
at
large
the
story
of
her
undoing
her
quality
her
fortune
her
nice
education
the
care
and
tenderness
of
her
noble
parents
and
charges
all
her
fate
to
the
evil
conduct
of
her
heedless
youth
sometimes
the
reflection
on
her
ruin
she
looking
back
upon
her
former
innocence
and
tranquillity
forces
the
tears
to
flow
from
her
fair
eyes
and
makes
sigh
and
weep
by
sympathy
sometimes
arrived
at
the
amorous
part
of
her
relation
she
would
sigh
and
languish
with
the
remembrance
of
past
joys
in
their
beginning
love
and
sometimes
smile
at
the
little
unlucky
adventures
they
met
with
and
their
escapes
so
that
different
passions
seized
her
soul
while
she
spoke
while
that
of
all
love
filled
he
dotes
he
burns
and
every
word
she
utters
enflames
him
still
the
more
he
fixes
his
very
soul
upon
her
tongue
and
darts
his
very
eyes
into
her
face
and
every
thing
she
says
raises
his
vast
esteem
and
passion
higher
in
fine
having
with
the
eloquence
of
sacred
wit
and
all
the
charms
of
every
differing
passion
finished
her
moving
tale
they
both
declined
their
eyes
whose
falling
showers
kept
equal
time
and
pace
and
for
a
little
time
were
still
as
thought
when
oppressed
with
mighty
love
broke
the
soft
silence
and
burst
into
extravagance
of
passion
says
all
that
men
grown
mad
with
love
and
wishing
could
utter
to
the
idol
of
his
heart
and
to
oblige
her
more
recounts
his
life
in
short
wherein
in
spite
of
all
his
modesty
she
found
all
that
was
great
and
brave
all
that
was
noble
fortunate
and
honest
and
having
now
confirmed
her
he
deserved
her
kneeling
implored
she
would
accept
of
him
not
as
a
lover
for
a
term
of
passion
for
dates
of
months
or
years
but
for
a
long
eternity
not
as
a
rifler
of
her
sacred
honour
but
to
defend
it
from
the
censuring
world
he
vowed
he
would
forget
that
ever
any
part
of
it
was
lost
nor
by
a
look
or
action
ever
upbraid
her
with
a
misfortune
past
but
still
look
forward
on
nobler
joys
to
come
and
now
implores
that
he
may
bring
a
priest
to
tie
the
solemn
knot
in
spite
of
all
her
love
for
she
could
not
choose
but
take
this
offer
kindly
and
indeed
it
made
a
very
great
impression
on
her
heart
she
knew
nothing
but
the
height
of
love
could
oblige
a
man
of
his
quality
and
vast
fortune
with
all
the
advantages
of
youth
and
beauty
to
marry
her
in
so
ill
circumstances
and
paying
him
first
those
acknowledgements
that
were
due
on
so
great
an
occasion
with
all
the
tenderness
in
her
voice
and
eyes
that
she
could
put
on
she
excused
herself
from
receiving
the
favour
by
telling
him
she
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
be
with
child
by
the
ungrateful
man
and
falling
at
that
thought
into
new
tears
she
moved
him
to
infinite
love
and
infinite
compassion
insomuch
that
wholly
abandoning
himself
to
softness
he
assured
her
if
she
would
secure
him
all
his
happiness
by
marrying
him
now
that
he
would
wait
till
she
were
brought
to
bed
before
he
would
demand
the
glorious
recompense
he
aspired
to
so
that
being
oppressed
with
obligation
finding
yet
in
her
soul
a
violent
passion
for
she
knew
not
how
to
take
or
how
to
refuse
the
blessing
offered
since
was
a
man
whom
in
her
height
of
innocence
and
youth
she
might
have
been
vain
and
proud
of
engaging
to
this
degree
he
saw
her
pain
and
irresolution
and
being
absolutely
undone
with
love
delivers
her
last
letter
to
him
with
what
he
had
sent
her
enclosed
the
sight
of
the
very
outside
of
it
made
her
grow
pale
as
death
and
a
feebleness
seized
her
all
over
that
made
her
unable
for
a
moment
to
open
it
all
which
confusion
saw
with
pain
which
she
perceiving
recollected
her
thoughts
as
well
as
she
could
and
opened
it
and
read
it
that
to
first
as
being
fondest
of
the
continuation
of
the
history
of
his
falsehood
she
read
and
often
paused
to
recover
her
spirits
that
were
fainting
at
every
period
and
having
finished
it
she
fell
down
on
the
bed
where
they
sat
caught
her
in
her
fall
in
his
arms
where
she
remained
dead
some
moments
whilst
he
just
on
the
point
of
being
so
himself
ravingly
called
for
help
and
being
in
the
ran
to
them
and
by
degrees
recovered
and
asked
a
thousand
pardons
for
exposing
a
weakness
to
him
which
was
but
the
effects
of
the
last
blaze
of
love
and
taking
a
cordial
which
brought
her
she
roused
resolved
and
took
by
the
hand
now
said
she
shew
yourself
that
generous
lover
you
have
professed
and
give
me
your
vows
of
revenge
on
and
after
that
by
all
that
is
holy
kneeling
as
she
spoke
and
holding
him
fast
by
all
my
injured
innocence
by
all
my
noble
father
s
wrongs
and
my
dear
mother
s
grief
by
all
my
sister
s
sufferings
i
swear
i
will
marry
you
love
you
and
give
you
all
this
she
spoke
without
considering
was
by
and
spoke
it
with
all
the
rage
and
blushes
in
her
face
that
injured
love
and
revenge
could
inspire
and
on
the
other
side
the
sense
of
his
sister
s
honour
lost
and
that
of
the
tender
passion
he
had
for
made
him
swear
by
all
that
was
sacred
and
by
all
the
vows
of
eternal
love
and
honour
he
had
made
to
to
go
and
revenge
himself
and
her
on
the
false
friend
and
lover
and
confessed
the
second
motive
which
was
his
sister
s
fame
for
cried
he
foul
adulteress
that
false
is
so
allied
to
but
still
he
urged
that
would
add
to
the
justness
of
his
cause
if
he
might
depart
her
husband
as
well
as
lover
and
revenge
an
injured
wife
as
well
as
sister
and
now
he
could
ask
nothing
she
did
not
easily
grant
and
because
it
was
late
in
the
day
they
concluded
that
the
morning
shall
consummate
all
his
desires
and
now
she
gives
him
her
letter
to
read
for
said
she
i
shall
esteem
myself
henceforth
so
absolutely
that
i
will
not
so
much
as
read
a
line
from
that
perjured
ruiner
of
my
honour
he
took
the
letter
with
smiles
and
bows
of
gratitude
and
read
it
philander
sylvia
there
are
a
thousand
reasons
dearest
at
this
time
that
prevent
my
writing
to
you
reasons
that
will
be
convincing
enough
to
oblige
my
pardon
and
plead
my
cause
with
her
that
loves
me
all
which
i
will
lay
before
you
when
i
have
the
happiness
to
see
you
i
have
met
with
some
affairs
since
my
arrival
to
this
place
that
wholly
take
up
my
time
affairs
of
state
whose
fatigues
have
put
my
heart
extremely
out
of
tune
and
if
not
carefully
managed
may
turn
to
my
perpetual
ruin
so
that
i
have
not
an
hour
in
a
day
to
spare
for
which
believe
me
is
the
greatest
affliction
of
my
life
and
i
have
no
prospect
of
ease
in
the
endless
toils
of
life
but
that
of
reposing
in
the
arms
of
some
short
intervals
pardon
my
haste
for
you
can
not
guess
the
weighty
business
that
at
present
robs
you
of
philander
lie
false
villain
replied
in
mighty
rage
i
can
guess
your
business
and
can
revenge
it
too
curse
on
thee
slave
to
think
me
grown
as
poor
in
sense
as
honour
to
be
cajoled
with
this
stuff
that
would
never
sham
a
chambermaid
death
am
i
so
forlorn
so
despicable
i
am
not
worth
the
pains
of
being
well
dissembled
with
confusion
overtake
him
misery
seize
him
may
i
become
his
plague
while
life
remains
or
public
tortures
end
him
this
with
all
the
madness
that
ever
inspired
a
lunatic
she
uttered
with
tears
and
violent
actions
when
besought
her
not
to
afflict
herself
and
almost
wished
he
did
not
love
a
temper
so
contrary
to
his
own
he
told
her
he
was
sorry
extremely
sorry
to
find
she
still
retained
so
violent
a
passion
for
a
man
unworthy
of
her
least
concern
when
she
replied
do
not
mistake
my
soul
by
heaven
it
is
pride
disdain
despite
and
hate
to
think
he
should
believe
this
dull
excuse
could
pass
upon
my
judgement
had
the
false
traitor
told
me
that
he
hated
me
or
that
his
faithless
date
of
love
was
out
i
had
been
tame
with
all
my
injuries
but
poorly
thus
to
impose
upon
my
wit
by
heaven
he
shall
not
bear
the
affront
to
hell
in
triumph
no
more
i
have
vowed
he
shall
not
my
soul
has
fixed
and
now
will
be
at
ease
forgive
me
oh
and
letting
herself
fall
into
his
arms
she
soon
obtained
what
she
asked
for
one
touch
of
the
fair
charmer
could
calm
him
into
love
and
softness
thus
after
a
thousand
transports
of
passion
on
his
side
and
all
the
seeming
tenderness
on
hers
the
night
being
far
advanced
and
new
confirmations
given
and
taken
on
either
side
of
pursuing
the
happy
agreement
in
the
morning
which
they
had
again
resolved
they
appointed
that
and
should
go
three
miles
out
of
town
to
a
little
village
where
there
was
a
church
and
that
should
meet
them
there
to
be
confirmed
and
secured
of
all
the
happiness
he
proposed
to
himself
in
this
world
being
so
wholly
bent
upon
revenge
for
the
accomplishment
of
which
alone
she
accepted
of
that
she
had
lost
all
remembrance
of
her
former
marriage
with
or
if
it
ever
entered
into
her
thought
it
was
only
considered
as
a
sham
nothing
designed
but
to
secure
her
from
being
taken
from
by
her
parents
and
without
any
respect
to
the
sacred
tie
to
be
regarded
no
more
nor
did
she
design
this
with
from
any
respect
she
had
to
the
holy
state
of
matrimony
but
from
a
lust
of
vengeance
which
she
would
buy
at
any
price
and
which
she
found
no
man
so
well
able
to
satisfy
as
but
what
wretched
changes
of
fortune
she
met
with
after
this
and
what
miserable
portion
of
fate
was
destined
to
this
unhappy
wanderer
the
last
part
of
life
and
the
third
and
last
part
of
this
history
shall
most
faithfully
relate
end
of

second

amours
of

part
iii
the
brave
the
generous
and
the
amorous
having
left
absolutely
resolved
to
give
herself
to
that
doting
fond
lover
or
rather
to
sacrifice
herself
to
her
revenge
that
unconsidering
unfortunate
whose
passion
had
exposed
him
to
all
the
unreasonable
effects
of
it
returned
to
his
own
house
wholly
transported
with
his
happy
success
he
thinks
on
nothing
but
vast
coming
joys
nor
did
one
kind
thought
direct
him
back
to
the
evil
consequences
of
what
he
so
hastily
pursued
he
reflects
not
on
her
circumstances
but
her
charms
not
on
the
infamy
he
should
espouse
with
but
on
those
ravishing
pleasures
she
was
capable
of
giving
him
he
regards
not
the
reproaches
of
his
friends
but
wholly
abandoned
to
love
and
youthful
imaginations
gives
a
loose
to
young
desire
and
fancy
that
deludes
him
with
a
thousand
soft
ideas
he
reflects
not
that
his
gentle
and
easy
temper
was
most
unfit
to
join
with
that
of
which
was
the
most
haughty
and
humorous
in
nature
for
though
she
had
all
the
charms
of
youth
and
beauty
that
are
conquering
in
her
sex
all
the
wit
and
insinuation
that
even
surpasses
youth
and
beauty
yet
to
render
her
character
impartially
she
had
also
abundance
of
disagreeing
qualities
mixed
with
her
perfections
she
was
imperious
and
proud
even
to
insolence
vain
and
conceited
even
to
folly
she
knew
her
virtues
and
her
graces
too
well
and
her
vices
too
little
she
was
very
opinionated
and
obstinate
hard
to
be
convinced
of
the
falsest
argument
but
very
positive
in
her
fancied
judgement
abounding
in
her
own
sense
and
very
critical
on
that
of
others
censorious
and
too
apt
to
charge
others
with
those
crimes
to
which
she
was
herself
addicted
or
had
been
guilty
of
amorously
inclined
and
indiscreet
in
the
management
of
her
amours
and
constant
rather
from
pride
and
shame
than
inclination
fond
of
catching
at
every
trifling
conquest
and
loving
the
triumph
though
she
hated
the
slave
yet
she
had
virtues
too
that
balanced
her
vices
among
which
we
must
allow
her
to
have
loved
with
a
passion
that
nothing
but
his
ingratitude
could
have
decayed
in
her
heart
nor
was
it
lessened
but
by
a
force
that
gave
her
a
thousand
tortures
racks
and
pangs
which
had
almost
cost
her
her
less
valued
life
for
being
of
a
temper
nice
in
love
and
very
fiery
apt
to
fly
into
rages
at
every
accident
that
did
but
touch
that
tenderest
part
her
heart
she
suffered
a
world
of
violence
and
extremity
of
rage
and
grief
by
turns
at
this
affront
and
inconstancy
of
nevertheless
she
was
now
so
discreet
or
rather
cunning
to
dissemble
her
resentment
the
best
she
could
to
her
generous
lover
for
whom
she
had
more
inclination
than
she
yet
had
leisure
to
perceive
and
which
she
now
attributes
wholly
to
her
revenge
and
considering
as
the
most
proper
instrument
for
that
she
fancies
what
was
indeed
a
growing
tenderness
from
the
sense
of
his
merit
to
be
the
effects
of
that
revenge
she
so
much
thirsted
after
and
though
without
she
dissembled
a
calm
within
she
was
all
fury
and
disorder
all
storm
and
distraction
she
went
to
bed
racked
with
a
thousand
thoughts
of
despairing
love
sometimes
all
the
softness
of
in
their
happy
enjoyments
came
in
view
and
made
her
sometimes
weep
and
sometimes
faint
with
the
dear
loved
remembrance
sometimes
his
late
enjoyments
with
and
then
she
raved
and
burnt
with
frantic
rage
but
oh
at
last
she
found
her
hope
was
gone
and
wisely
fell
to
argue
with
her
soul
she
knew
love
would
not
long
subsist
on
the
thin
diet
of
despair
and
resolving
he
was
never
to
be
retrieved
who
once
had
ceased
to
love
she
strove
to
bend
her
soul
to
useful
reason
and
thinks
on
all
obligations
his
vows
his
assiduity
his
beauty
his
youth
his
fortune
and
his
generous
offer
and
with
the
aid
of
pride
resolves
to
unfix
her
heart
and
give
it
better
treatment
in
his
bosom
to
cease
at
least
to
love
the
false
if
she
could
never
force
her
soul
to
hate
him
and
though
this
was
not
so
soon
done
as
thought
on
in
a
heart
so
prepossesed
as
that
of
yet
there
is
some
hope
of
a
recovery
when
a
woman
in
that
extremity
will
but
think
of
listening
to
love
from
any
new
adorer
and
having
once
resolved
to
pursue
the
fugitive
no
more
with
the
natural
artillery
of
their
sighs
and
tears
reproaches
and
complaints
they
have
recourse
to
every
thing
that
may
soonest
chase
from
the
heart
those
thoughts
that
oppress
it
for
nature
is
not
inclined
to
hurt
itself
and
there
are
but
very
few
who
find
it
necessary
to
die
of
the
disease
of
love
of
this
sort
was
our
though
to
give
her
her
due
never
any
person
who
did
not
indeed
die
ever
languished
under
the
torments
of
love
as
did
that
charming
and
afflicted
maid
while
remained
in
these
eternal
inquietudes
having
quitted
her
chamber
takes
this
opportunity
to
go
to
that
of
whom
she
had
not
visited
in
two
days
before
being
extremely
troubled
at
his
design
which
she
now
found
he
had
on
her
lady
she
had
a
mind
to
vent
her
spleen
and
as
the
proverb
says
whore
first
longed
as
much
to
see
her
to
rail
at
her
for
being
privy
to
approach
to
bed
as
he
thought
she
imagined
and
not
giving
him
an
account
of
it
as
she
used
to
do
of
all
the
secrets
of
her
lady
she
finds
him
alone
in
her
chamber
recovered
from
all
but
the
torments
of
his
unhappy
disappointment
she
approached
him
with
all
the
anger
her
sort
of
passion
could
inspire
for
love
in
a
mean
unthinking
soul
is
not
that
glorious
thing
it
is
in
the
brave
however
she
had
enough
to
serve
her
pleasure
for
was
young
and
handsome
and
both
being
bent
on
railing
without
knowing
each
other
s
intentions
they
both
equally
flew
into
high
words
he
upbraiding
her
with
her
infidelity
and
she
him
with
his
are
not
you
said
he
growing
more
calm
the
falsest
of
your
tribe
to
keep
a
secret
from
me
that
so
much
concerned
me
is
it
for
this
i
have
refused
the
addresses
of
burgomasters
wives
and
daughters
where
i
could
have
made
my
fortune
and
my
satisfaction
to
keep
myself
entirely
for
a
thing
that
betrays
me
and
keeps
every
secret
of
her
heart
from
me
false
and
forsworn
i
will
be
fool
no
it
is
well
sir
replied
that
you
having
been
the
most
perfidious
man
alive
should
accuse
me
who
am
innocent
come
come
sir
you
have
not
carried
matters
so
swimmingly
but
i
could
easily
dive
into
the
other
night
s
intrigue
and
what
secret
thou
false
one
thou
art
all
over
secret
a
very
hopeful
bawd
at
eighteen
go
i
hate
ye
at
this
she
wept
and
he
pursued
his
railing
to
her
you
thought
because
your
deed
were
done
in
darkness
they
were
concealed
from
a
lover
s
eye
no
thou
young
viper
i
saw
i
heard
and
felt
and
satisfied
every
sense
of
this
thy
falsehood
when
was
conducted
to
bed
by
what
said
she
if
instead
of
i
conducted
the
perfidious
traitor
to
love
who
then
was
false
and
perjured
at
this
he
blushed
extremely
which
was
too
visible
on
his
fair
face
she
being
now
confirmed
she
had
the
better
of
him
continued
let
thy
confusion
said
she
with
scorn
witness
the
truth
of
what
i
say
and
i
have
been
but
too
well
acquainted
with
that
body
of
yours
weeping
as
she
spoke
to
mistake
it
for
that
of
softly
dear
replied
he
nay
now
your
tears
have
calmed
me
and
taking
her
in
his
arms
sought
to
appease
her
by
all
the
arguments
of
seeming
love
and
tenderness
while
she
yet
wholly
unsatisfied
in
that
cheat
of
his
of
going
to
sylvia
s
bed
remained
still
pouting
and
very
frumpish
but
he
that
had
but
one
argument
left
that
on
all
occasions
served
to
convince
her
had
at
last
recourse
to
that
which
put
her
in
good
humour
and
hanging
on
his
neck
she
kindly
chid
him
for
putting
such
a
trick
upon
her
lady
he
told
her
and
confirmed
it
with
an
oath
that
he
did
it
but
to
try
how
far
she
was
just
to
his
friend
and
lord
and
not
any
desire
he
had
for
a
beauty
that
was
too
much
of
his
own
complexion
to
charm
him
it
was
only
the
brunette
and
the
black
such
as
herself
that
could
move
him
to
desire
thus
he
shams
her
into
perfect
peace
and
why
said
she
were
you
not
satisfied
that
she
was
false
as
well
from
the
assignation
as
the
trial
oh
no
said
he
you
women
have
a
thousand
arts
of
gibing
and
no
man
ought
to
believe
you
but
put
you
to
the
well
said
she
when
i
had
brought
you
to
the
bed
when
you
found
her
arms
stretched
out
to
receive
you
why
did
you
not
retire
like
an
honest
man
and
leave
her
to
herself
oh
fie
said
he
that
had
not
been
to
have
acted
to
the
life
but
would
have
made
a
ah
said
she
that
was
your
aim
to
have
acted
to
the
life
i
believe
and
not
to
discover
my
lady
s
constancy
to
your
lord
but
i
suppose
you
have
been
sworn
at
the
butt
of
never
to
kiss
the
maid
when
you
can
kiss
the
but
he
renewing
his
caresses
and
asseverations
of
love
to
her
she
suffered
herself
to
be
convinced
of
all
he
had
a
mind
to
have
her
believe
after
this
she
could
not
contain
any
secret
from
him
but
told
him
she
had
something
to
say
to
him
which
if
he
knew
would
convince
him
she
had
all
the
passion
in
the
world
for
him
he
presses
eagerly
to
know
and
she
pursues
to
tell
him
it
is
as
much
as
her
life
is
worth
to
discover
it
and
that
she
lies
under
the
obligation
of
an
oath
not
to
tell
it
but
kisses
and
rhetoric
prevail
and
she
cries
what
will
you
say
now
if
my
lady
may
marry
one
of
the
greatest
and
most
considerable
persons
in
all
this
country
i
should
not
wonder
at
her
conquest
replied
but
i
should
wonder
if
she
should
then
cease
your
wonder
replied
she
she
is
to
be
married
to
count
whom
she
is
to
meet
at
nine
in
the
morning
to
that
end
at
a
little
village
a
league
from
this
she
spoke
and
he
believes
and
finds
it
true
by
the
raging
of
his
blood
which
he
could
not
conceal
from
and
for
which
he
feigns
a
thousand
excuses
to
the
amorous
maid
and
charges
his
concern
on
that
for
his
lord
at
last
after
some
more
discourse
on
that
subject
he
pretends
to
grow
sleepy
and
hastens
her
to
her
chamber
and
locking
the
door
after
her
he
began
to
reflect
on
what
she
had
said
and
grew
to
all
the
torment
of
rage
and
jealousy
and
all
the
despairs
of
a
passionate
lover
and
though
this
hope
was
not
extreme
before
yet
as
lovers
do
he
found
or
fancied
a
probability
from
his
lord
s
inconstancy
and
his
own
right
of
marriage
that
the
necessity
she
might
chance
to
be
in
of
his
friendship
and
assistance
in
a
strange
country
might
some
happy
moment
or
other
render
him
the
blessing
he
so
long
had
waited
for
from
for
he
ever
designed
when
either
his
lord
left
her
grew
cold
or
should
happen
to
die
to
put
in
his
claim
of
husband
and
the
soft
familiar
way
with
which
she
eternally
lived
with
him
encouraged
this
hope
and
design
nay
she
had
often
made
him
advances
to
that
happy
expectation
but
this
fatal
blow
had
driven
him
from
all
his
fancied
joys
to
the
most
wretched
estate
of
a
desperate
lover
he
traverses
his
chamber
wounded
with
a
thousand
different
thoughts
mixed
with
those
of
preventing
this
union
the
next
morning
sometimes
he
resolves
to
fight
for
his
birth
might
pretend
to
it
and
he
wanted
no
courage
but
he
is
afraid
of
being
overcome
by
that
gallant
man
and
either
losing
his
hopes
with
his
life
or
if
he
killed
to
be
forced
from
his
happiness
or
die
an
ignominious
death
sometimes
he
resolves
to
own
for
his
wife
but
then
he
fears
the
rage
of
that
dear
object
of
his
soul
which
he
dreads
more
than
death
itself
so
that
tossed
from
one
extreme
to
another
from
one
resolution
to
a
hundred
he
was
not
able
to
fix
upon
any
thing
in
this
perplexity
he
remained
till
day
appeared
that
day
must
advance
with
his
undoing
while
and
were
preparing
for
the
design
concluded
on
the
last
night
this
he
heard
and
every
minute
that
approached
gave
him
new
torments
so
that
now
he
would
have
given
himself
to
the
prince
of
darkness
for
a
kind
disappointment
he
was
often
ready
to
go
and
throw
himself
at
her
feet
and
plead
against
her
enterprise
in
hand
and
to
urge
the
unlawfulness
of
a
double
marriage
ready
to
make
vows
for
the
fidelity
of
though
before
so
much
against
his
own
interest
and
to
tell
her
all
those
letters
from
him
were
forged
he
thought
on
all
things
but
nothing
remained
with
him
but
despair
of
every
thing
at
last
the
devil
and
his
own
subtlety
put
him
upon
a
prevention
though
base
yet
the
most
likely
to
succeed
in
his
opinion
he
knew
there
were
many
factions
in
and
that
the
themselves
were
divided
in
their
interests
and
a
thousand
jealousies
and
fears
were
eternally
spread
amongst
the
rabble
there
were
cabals
for
every
interest
that
of
the
so
prevailing
that
of
the
and
that
of
the
illustrious
and
others
for
the
so
that
it
was
not
a
difficulty
to
move
any
mischief
and
pass
it
off
among
the
crowd
for
dangerous
consequences
knew
each
division
and
which
way
they
were
inclined
he
knew
was
not
so
well
with
the
as
not
to
be
easily
rendered
worse
for
he
was
so
entirely
a
creature
and
favourite
of
the
prince
that
they
conceived
abundance
of
jealousies
of
him
which
they
durst
not
own
besides
knew
a
great
man
who
having
a
pique
to
might
the
sooner
be
brought
to
receive
any
ill
character
of
him
to
this
sullen
magistrate
he
applies
himself
and
deluding
the
credulous
busy
old
man
with
a
thousand
circumstantial
lies
he
discovers
to
him
that
held
a
correspondence
with
the
king
to
betray
the
state
and
that
he
caballed
to
that
end
with
some
who
were
looked
upon
as
rebels
but
indeed
were
no
other
than
spies
to
this
coming
from
a
man
of
that
party
and
whose
lord
was
a
rebel
gained
a
perfect
credit
with
the
old
sir
so
that
immediately
hasting
to
the
he
lays
this
weighty
affair
before
them
who
soon
found
it
reasonable
if
not
true
at
least
they
feared
and
sent
out
a
warrant
for
the
speedy
apprehending
him
but
coming
to
his
house
though
early
they
found
him
gone
and
being
informed
which
way
he
took
the
messenger
pursued
him
and
found
his
coach
at
the
door
of
a
too
obscure
for
his
quality
which
made
them
apprehend
this
was
some
place
of
rendezvous
where
he
possibly
met
with
his
traitorous
associators
they
send
in
and
cunningly
inquire
who
he
waited
for
or
who
was
with
him
and
they
understood
he
stayed
for
some
gentleman
of
the
nation
for
he
had
ordered
to
come
in
man
s
clothes
that
she
might
not
be
known
and
had
given
order
below
that
if
two
gentlemen
came
they
should
be
brought
to
him
this
information
made
the
scandal
as
clear
as
day
and
the
messenger
no
longer
doubted
of
the
reasonableness
of
his
warrant
though
he
was
loath
to
serve
it
on
a
person
whose
father
he
had
served
so
many
years
he
waits
at
some
distance
from
the
house
unseen
though
he
could
take
a
view
of
all
he
saw
come
often
out
into
the
balcony
and
look
with
longing
eyes
towards
the
road
that
leads
to
the
town
he
saw
him
all
rich
and
gay
as
a
young
bridegroom
lovely
and
young
as
the
morning
that
flattered
him
with
so
fair
and
happy
a
day
at
last
he
saw
two
gentlemen
alight
at
the
door
and
giving
their
horses
to
a
page
to
walk
the
while
they
ran
up
into
the
chamber
where
was
waiting
who
had
already
sent
his
page
to
prepare
the
priest
in
the
to
marry
them
you
may
imagine
with
what
love
and
joy
the
ravished
youth
approached
the
idol
of
his
soul
and
she
who
beholds
him
in
more
beauty
than
ever
yet
she
thought
he
had
appeared
pleased
with
all
things
he
had
on
with
the
gay
morning
the
flowery
field
the
air
the
little
journey
and
a
thousand
diverting
things
made
no
resistance
to
those
fond
embraces
that
pressed
her
a
thousand
times
with
silent
transport
and
falling
tears
of
eager
love
and
pleasure
but
even
in
that
moment
of
content
she
forgot
and
received
all
the
satisfaction
so
soft
a
lover
could
dispense
while
they
were
mutually
thus
exchanging
looks
and
almost
hearts
the
messenger
came
into
the
room
and
as
civilly
as
possible
told
he
had
a
warrant
for
him
to
secure
him
as
a
traitor
to
the
state
and
a
spy
for
you
need
not
be
told
the
surprise
and
astonishment
he
was
in
however
he
obeyed
the
messenger
turning
to
cried
sir
though
i
can
hardly
credit
this
crime
that
is
charged
to
my
lord
yet
the
finding
him
here
with
two
gentlemen
gives
me
some
more
fears
that
there
may
be
something
in
it
and
it
would
do
well
if
you
would
deliver
yourselves
into
my
hands
for
the
farther
clearing
this
this
foolish
grave
speech
of
the
messenger
had
like
to
have
put
into
a
loud
laughter
he
addressing
himself
to
two
women
for
two
men
but
replied
i
hope
you
do
not
take
us
for
so
little
friends
to
the
gallant
to
abandon
him
in
this
misfortune
no
we
will
share
it
with
him
be
it
what
it
to
this
the
generous
lover
blushing
with
kind
surprise
bowed
and
kissing
her
hand
with
transport
called
her
his
charming
friend
and
so
all
three
being
guarded
back
in
coach
they
return
to
the
town
and
to
the
house
of
the
messenger
which
made
a
great
noise
all
over
that
was
taken
with
two
jesuits
plotting
to
fire
and
a
thousand
things
equally
ridiculous
they
were
all
three
lodged
together
in
one
house
that
of
the
messenger
which
was
very
fine
and
fit
to
entertain
any
persons
of
quality
while
who
did
not
like
that
part
of
the
project
bethought
him
of
a
thousand
ways
how
to
free
her
from
thence
for
he
designed
as
soon
as
should
be
taken
to
have
got
her
to
have
quitted
the
town
under
pretence
of
being
taken
upon
suspicion
of
holding
correspondence
with
him
because
they
were
but
her
delivering
herself
up
had
not
only
undone
all
his
design
but
had
made
it
unsafe
for
him
to
stay
while
he
was
thus
bethinking
himself
what
he
should
do
uncle
who
was
one
of
the
extremely
affronted
at
the
indignity
put
upon
his
nephew
and
his
sole
heir
the
darling
of
his
heart
and
eyes
commands
that
this
informer
may
be
secured
and
accordingly
was
taken
into
custody
who
giving
himself
over
for
a
lost
man
resolves
to
put
himself
upon
mercy
by
telling
him
the
motives
that
induced
him
to
this
violent
and
ungenerous
course
it
was
some
days
before
the
council
thought
fit
to
call
for
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
for
himself
in
the
mean
time
he
having
not
had
permission
yet
to
see
and
being
extremely
desirous
of
that
happiness
he
bethought
himself
that
the
messenger
having
been
in
his
father
s
service
might
have
so
much
respect
for
the
son
as
to
allow
him
to
speak
to
that
fair
charmer
provided
he
might
be
a
witness
to
what
he
should
say
he
sends
for
him
and
demanded
of
him
where
those
two
fair
prisoners
were
lodged
who
came
with
him
in
the
morning
he
told
him
in
a
very
good
apartment
on
the
same
floor
and
that
they
were
very
well
accommodated
and
seemed
to
have
no
other
trouble
but
what
they
suffered
for
him
i
hope
my
lord
added
he
your
confinement
will
not
be
long
for
i
hear
there
is
a
person
taken
up
who
has
confessed
he
did
it
for
a
revenge
on
at
this
was
very
well
pleased
and
asked
him
who
it
was
and
he
told
him
a
gentleman
belonging
to
the
count
who
about
six
months
ago
was
obliged
to
quit
the
town
as
an
enemy
to
he
soon
knew
it
to
be
and
comparing
this
action
with
some
others
of
his
lately
committed
he
no
longer
doubts
it
the
effects
of
his
jealousy
he
asked
the
messenger
if
it
were
impossible
to
gain
so
much
favour
of
him
as
to
let
him
visit
those
two
gentlemen
he
being
by
while
he
was
with
them
the
keeper
soon
granted
his
request
and
replied
there
was
no
hazard
he
would
not
run
to
serve
him
and
immediately
putting
back
the
hangings
with
one
of
those
keys
he
had
in
his
hand
he
opened
a
door
in
his
chamber
that
led
into
a
gallery
of
fine
pictures
and
from
thence
they
passed
into
the
apartment
of
as
soon
as
he
came
in
he
threw
himself
at
her
feet
and
she
received
him
and
took
him
up
into
her
arms
with
all
the
transports
of
joy
a
soul
more
than
ever
possessed
with
love
for
him
could
conceive
and
though
they
all
appeared
of
the
masculine
sex
the
messenger
soon
perceived
his
error
and
begged
a
thousand
pardons
makes
haste
to
tell
her
his
opinion
of
the
cause
of
all
this
trouble
to
both
and
she
easily
believed
when
she
heard
was
taken
that
it
was
as
he
imagined
for
he
had
been
found
too
often
faulty
not
to
be
suspected
now
this
thought
brought
a
great
calm
to
both
their
spirits
and
almost
reduced
them
to
the
first
soft
tranquillity
with
which
they
began
the
day
for
he
protested
his
innocence
a
thousand
times
which
was
wholly
needless
for
the
generous
maid
believed
before
he
spoke
he
could
not
be
guilty
of
the
sin
of
treachery
he
renews
his
vows
to
her
of
eternal
love
and
that
he
would
perform
what
they
were
so
unluckily
prevented
from
doing
this
morning
and
that
though
possibly
by
this
unhappy
adventure
his
design
might
have
taken
air
and
have
arrived
to
the
knowledge
of
his
uncle
yet
in
spite
of
all
opposition
of
friends
or
the
malice
of
he
would
pursue
his
glorious
design
of
marrying
her
though
he
were
forced
for
it
to
wander
in
the
farthest
parts
of
the
earth
with
his
lovely
prize
he
begs
she
will
not
disesteem
him
for
this
scandal
on
his
fame
for
he
was
all
love
all
soft
desire
and
had
no
other
design
than
that
of
making
himself
master
of
that
greatest
treasure
in
the
world
that
of
the
possessing
the
most
charming
the
in
return
she
paid
him
all
the
vows
that
could
secure
an
infidel
in
love
she
made
him
all
the
endearing
advances
a
heart
could
wish
wholly
given
up
to
tender
passion
insomuch
that
he
believes
and
is
the
gayest
man
that
ever
was
blest
by
love
and
the
messenger
who
was
present
all
this
while
found
that
this
caballing
with
the
spies
was
only
an
innocent
design
to
give
himself
away
to
a
fine
young
lady
and
therefore
gave
them
all
the
freedom
they
desired
and
which
they
made
use
of
to
the
most
advantage
love
could
direct
or
youth
inspire
this
suffering
with
begot
a
pity
and
compassion
in
the
heart
of
and
that
grew
up
to
love
for
he
had
all
the
charms
that
could
inspire
and
every
hour
was
adding
new
fire
to
her
heart
which
at
last
burnt
into
a
flame
such
power
has
mighty
obligation
on
a
heart
that
has
any
grateful
sentiments
and
yet
when
she
was
absent
from
and
thought
on
passion
for
she
would
rage
and
rave
and
find
the
effects
of
wondrous
love
and
wondrous
pride
and
be
even
ready
to
make
vows
against
but
those
were
fits
that
seldomer
seized
her
now
and
every
fit
was
like
a
departing
ague
still
weaker
than
the
former
and
at
the
sight
of
all
would
vanish
her
blushes
would
rise
and
discover
the
soft
thoughts
her
heart
conceived
for
the
approaching
lover
and
she
soon
found
that
vulgar
error
of
the
impossibility
of
loving
more
than
once
it
was
four
days
they
thus
remained
without
being
called
to
the
council
and
every
day
brought
its
new
joys
along
with
it
they
were
never
asunder
never
interrupted
with
any
visit
but
one
for
a
few
moments
in
a
day
by
uncle
and
then
he
would
go
into
his
own
apartment
to
receive
him
he
offered
to
bail
him
out
but
who
had
found
more
real
joy
there
than
in
any
part
of
the
earth
besides
evaded
the
obligation
by
telling
his
uncle
he
would
be
obliged
to
nothing
but
his
innocence
for
his
liberty
so
would
get
rid
of
the
fond
old
gentleman
who
never
knew
a
passion
but
for
his
darling
nephew
and
returned
with
as
much
joy
to
the
lodgings
of
as
if
he
had
been
absent
a
week
which
is
an
age
to
a
lover
there
they
sometimes
would
play
at
cards
where
he
would
lose
considerable
sums
to
her
or
at
hazard
or
be
studying
what
they
should
do
next
to
pass
the
hours
most
to
her
content
not
but
he
had
rather
have
lain
eternally
at
her
feet
gazing
doting
and
saying
a
thousand
fond
things
which
at
every
view
he
took
were
conceived
in
his
soul
and
though
but
this
last
minute
he
had
finished
saying
all
that
love
could
dictate
he
found
his
heart
oppressed
with
a
vast
store
of
new
softness
which
he
languished
to
unload
in
her
ravishing
bosom
but
she
who
was
not
arrived
to
his
pitch
of
loving
diverts
his
softer
hours
with
play
sometimes
and
otherwhile
with
making
him
follow
her
into
the
gallery
which
was
adorned
with
pleasant
pictures
all
of
hand
which
afforded
great
variety
of
objects
very
droll
and
antique
finding
something
to
say
of
every
one
that
might
be
of
advantage
to
his
own
heart
for
whatever
argument
was
in
dispute
he
would
be
sure
to
bring
it
home
to
the
passion
he
had
for
it
should
end
in
love
however
remotely
begun
so
strange
an
art
has
love
to
turn
all
things
to
the
advantage
of
a
lover
it
was
thus
they
passed
their
time
and
nothing
was
wanting
that
lavish
experience
could
procure
and
every
minute
he
advances
to
new
freedoms
and
unspeakable
delights
but
still
such
as
might
hitherto
be
allowed
with
honour
he
sighs
and
wishes
he
languishes
and
dies
for
more
but
dares
not
utter
the
meaning
of
one
motion
of
breath
for
he
loved
so
very
much
that
every
look
from
those
fair
eyes
charmed
him
awed
him
to
a
respect
that
robbed
him
of
many
happy
moments
a
bolder
lover
would
have
turned
to
his
advantage
and
he
treated
her
as
if
she
had
been
an
unspotted
maid
with
caution
of
offending
he
had
forgot
that
general
rule
that
where
the
sacred
laws
of
honour
are
once
invaded
love
makes
the
easier
conquest
all
this
while
you
may
imagine
endured
no
little
torment
he
could
not
on
the
one
side
determine
what
the
would
do
with
him
when
once
they
should
find
him
a
false
accuser
of
so
great
a
man
and
on
the
other
side
he
suffered
a
thousand
pains
and
jealousies
from
love
he
knew
too
well
the
charms
and
power
of
and
what
effects
importunity
and
opportunity
have
on
the
temper
of
feeble
woman
he
found
the
did
not
make
so
considerable
a
matter
of
his
being
impeached
as
to
confine
him
strictly
and
he
dies
with
the
fears
of
those
happy
moments
he
might
possibly
enjoy
with
where
there
might
be
no
spies
about
her
to
give
him
any
kind
intelligence
and
all
that
could
afford
him
any
glimpse
of
consolation
was
that
while
they
were
thus
confined
he
was
out
of
fear
of
their
being
married
uncle
this
while
was
not
idle
but
taking
it
for
a
high
indignity
his
nephew
should
remain
so
long
without
being
heard
he
moved
it
to
the
council
and
accordingly
they
sent
for
him
to
the
the
next
morning
where
was
brought
to
confront
him
whom
as
soon
as
saw
with
a
scornful
smile
he
cried
it
is
well
that
you
who
durst
not
fight
me
fairly
should
find
out
this
nobler
way
of
ridding
yourself
of
a
rival
i
am
glad
at
least
that
i
have
no
more
honourable
a
witness
against
who
never
before
wanted
assurance
at
this
reproach
was
wholly
confounded
for
it
was
not
from
any
villainy
in
his
nature
but
the
absolute
effects
of
mad
and
desperate
passion
which
put
him
on
the
only
remedy
that
could
relieve
him
and
looking
on
with
modest
blushes
that
half
pleaded
for
him
he
cried
yes
my
lord
i
am
your
accuser
and
come
to
charge
your
innocence
with
the
greatest
of
crimes
and
you
ought
to
thank
me
for
my
accusation
when
you
shall
know
it
is
regard
to
my
own
honour
violent
love
for
and
extreme
respect
to
your
lordship
has
made
me
thus
saucy
with
your
unspotted
replied
shall
i
thank
you
for
accusing
me
with
a
plot
upon
the
state
yes
my
lord
replied
and
yet
you
had
a
plot
to
betray
the
state
and
by
so
new
a
way
as
could
be
found
out
by
none
but
so
great
and
brave
a
man
heavens
replied
enraged
this
is
an
impudence
that
nothing
but
a
traitor
to
his
own
king
and
one
bred
up
in
plots
and
mischiefs
could
have
invented
i
betray
my
own
country
yes
my
lord
cried
he
more
briskly
than
before
seeing
colour
so
at
him
to
all
the
looseness
of
unthinking
youth
to
all
the
breach
of
laws
both
human
and
divine
if
all
the
youth
should
follow
your
example
you
would
betray
posterity
itself
and
only
mad
confusion
would
abound
in
short
my
lord
that
lady
who
was
taken
with
you
by
the
messenger
was
my
and
going
towards
who
was
struck
as
with
a
he
seized
her
hand
and
cried
while
all
stood
gazing
on
this
lady
sir
i
mean
she
is
my
wife
my
lawful
married
at
this
could
no
longer
hold
her
patience
within
its
bounds
but
with
that
other
hand
he
had
left
her
she
struck
him
a
box
on
the
ear
that
almost
staggered
him
coming
unawares
and
as
she
struck
she
cried
aloud
thou
liest
base
villain
and
i
will
be
revenged
and
flinging
herself
out
of
his
hand
she
got
on
the
other
side
of
while
the
whole
company
remained
confounded
at
what
they
saw
and
heard
how
cried
out
old
uncle
to
woman
this
by
my
troth
sweet
lady
if
you
be
one
methought
you
were
a
very
pretty
and
turning
to
he
cried
why
what
sir
then
it
seems
all
this
noise
of
betraying
the
state
was
but
a
cuckold
s
dream
hah
and
this
wonderful
and
dangerous
plot
was
but
one
upon
your
wife
sir
hah
was
it
so
marry
sir
at
this
rate
i
rather
think
it
is
you
have
a
design
of
betraying
the
state
you
cuckoldy
knaves
that
bring
your
handsome
wives
to
seduce
our
young
senators
from
their
sobriety
and
are
these
the
recompenses
replied
you
give
the
injured
and
in
lieu
of
restoring
me
my
right
am
i
reproached
with
the
most
scandalous
infamy
that
can
befall
a
man
well
sir
replied
is
this
all
you
have
to
charge
this
gentleman
with
at
which
he
bowed
and
was
silent
and
continued
if
your
wife
sir
have
a
mind
to
my
nephew
or
he
to
her
it
should
have
been
your
care
to
have
forbid
it
or
prevented
it
by
keeping
her
under
lock
and
key
if
no
other
way
to
be
secured
and
sir
we
do
not
sit
here
to
relieve
fools
and
cuckolds
if
your
lady
will
be
civil
to
my
nephew
what
is
that
to
us
let
her
speak
for
herself
what
say
you
madam
i
say
replied
that
this
fellow
is
mad
and
raves
that
he
is
my
vassal
my
servant
my
slave
but
after
this
unworthy
of
the
meanest
of
these
this
she
spoke
with
a
disdain
that
sufficiently
shewed
the
pride
and
anger
of
her
soul
la
you
sir
replied
you
are
discharged
your
lady
s
service
it
is
a
plain
case
she
has
more
mind
to
the
young
count
than
the
husband
and
we
can
not
compel
people
to
be
honest
against
their
and
coming
down
from
the
seat
where
he
sat
he
embraced
a
hundred
times
and
told
the
board
he
was
extremely
glad
they
found
the
mighty
plot
but
a
vagary
of
youth
and
the
spleen
of
a
jealous
husband
or
lover
or
whatsoever
other
malicious
thing
and
desired
the
angry
man
might
be
discharged
since
he
had
so
just
a
provocation
as
the
loss
of
a
mistress
so
all
laughing
at
the
jest
that
had
made
so
great
a
noise
among
the
grave
and
wise
they
freed
them
all
and
advised
his
nephew
that
the
next
cuckold
he
made
he
would
make
a
friend
of
him
first
that
he
might
hear
of
no
more
complaints
against
him
but
very
gravely
replied
sir
you
have
infinitely
mistaken
the
character
of
this
lady
she
is
a
person
of
too
great
quality
for
this
raillery
at
more
leisure
you
shall
have
her
while
he
was
speaking
this
and
their
discharges
were
making
confounded
with
shame
indignation
and
anger
goes
out
and
taking
coach
that
stood
at
the
gate
went
directly
to
his
house
for
she
resolved
to
go
no
more
where
was
after
this
fell
seriously
to
good
advice
and
earnestly
besought
his
darling
to
leave
off
those
wild
extravagancies
that
had
so
long
made
so
great
a
discourse
all
the
province
over
where
nothing
but
his
splendid
amours
treats
balls
and
magnificences
of
love
was
the
business
of
the
town
and
that
he
had
forborne
to
tell
him
of
it
and
had
hitherto
justified
his
actions
though
they
had
not
deserved
it
and
he
doubted
this
was
the
lady
to
whom
for
these
six
or
eight
months
he
heard
he
had
so
entirely
dedicated
himself
he
desires
him
to
quit
this
lady
or
if
he
will
pursue
his
love
to
do
it
discreetly
to
love
some
unmarried
woman
and
not
injure
his
neighbours
to
all
which
he
blushed
and
bowed
and
silently
seemed
to
thank
him
for
his
grave
counsel
and
having
received
his
discharge
and
advice
how
he
provoked
the
displeasure
of
the
any
more
by
accusing
of
great
persons
he
was
ordered
to
ask
pardon
but
in
lieu
of
that
he
came
up
to
him
and
challenged
him
to
fight
him
for
the
injustice
he
had
done
him
in
taking
from
him
his
wife
for
he
was
sure
he
was
undone
in
her
favour
and
that
thought
made
him
mad
enough
to
put
himself
on
this
second
extravagancy
however
this
was
not
so
silently
managed
but
perceived
it
and
was
so
enraged
at
the
young
fellow
for
his
second
insolence
that
he
was
again
confined
and
sent
back
to
prison
where
he
swore
he
should
suffer
the
utmost
of
the
law
and
the
council
breaking
up
every
one
departed
to
his
own
home
but
never
was
man
ravished
with
excess
of
joy
as
was
to
find
meet
him
with
extended
arms
on
the
whom
he
did
not
imagine
to
have
found
there
nor
knew
he
how
he
stood
in
the
heart
of
the
charmer
of
his
own
since
the
affront
she
had
received
in
the
court
from
those
that
however
did
not
know
her
for
they
did
not
imagine
this
was
that
lady
sister
to
of
whose
beauty
they
had
heard
so
much
and
her
face
being
turned
from
the
light
the
old
gentleman
did
not
so
much
consider
or
see
it
came
into
his
house
the
back
way
through
the
stables
and
garden
and
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
seen
by
none
of
his
family
but
the
coachman
who
brought
her
home
whom
she
conjured
not
to
speak
of
it
to
the
rest
of
his
servants
and
unseen
of
any
body
she
got
into
his
apartment
for
often
she
had
been
there
at
treats
and
balls
with
she
was
alone
for
stayed
to
see
what
became
of
her
false
lover
and
after
he
was
seized
again
retired
to
her
lodging
the
most
disconsolate
woman
in
the
world
for
having
lost
her
hopes
of
to
whom
she
had
engaged
all
that
honour
she
had
but
when
she
missed
her
lady
there
she
accused
herself
with
all
the
falsehood
in
the
world
and
fell
to
repent
her
treachery
she
sends
the
page
to
inquire
at
house
but
no
body
there
could
give
him
any
intelligence
so
that
the
poor
amorous
youth
returning
without
hope
endured
all
the
pain
of
a
hopeless
lover
for
had
anew
charmed
his
coachman
and
calling
up
an
ancient
woman
who
was
his
who
had
been
his
nurse
he
acquainted
her
with
the
short
history
of
his
passion
for
and
ordered
her
to
give
her
attendance
on
the
treasure
of
his
life
he
bid
her
prepare
all
things
as
magnificent
as
she
could
in
that
apartment
he
designed
her
which
was
very
rich
and
gay
and
towards
a
fine
garden
the
hangings
and
beds
all
glorious
and
fitter
for
a
monarch
than
a
subject
the
finest
pictures
the
world
afforded
flowers
with
silver
and
ivory
gilded
roofs
carved
wainscot
tables
of
plate
with
all
the
rest
of
the
movables
in
the
chambers
of
the
same
all
of
great
value
and
all
was
perfumed
like
an
altar
or
the
marriage
bed
of
some
young
king
here
was
designed
to
lodge
and
hither
conducted
her
and
setting
her
on
a
couch
while
the
supper
was
getting
ready
he
sits
himself
down
by
her
and
his
heart
being
ready
to
burst
with
grief
at
the
thought
of
the
claim
which
was
laid
to
her
by
he
silently
views
her
while
tears
were
ready
to
break
from
his
fixed
eyes
and
sighs
stopped
what
he
would
fain
have
spoke
while
she
wholly
confounded
with
shame
guilt
and
disappointment
for
she
could
not
imagine
that
could
have
had
the
impudence
to
have
claimed
her
for
a
wife
fixed
her
fair
eyes
to
the
earth
and
durst
not
behold
the
languishing
they
remained
thus
a
long
time
silent
she
not
daring
to
defend
herself
from
a
crime
of
which
she
knew
too
well
she
was
guilty
nor
he
daring
to
ask
her
a
question
to
which
the
answer
might
prove
so
fatal
he
fears
to
know
what
he
dies
to
be
satisfied
in
and
she
fears
to
discover
too
late
a
secret
which
was
the
only
one
she
had
concealed
from
him
runs
over
in
his
mind
a
thousand
thoughts
that
perplex
him
of
the
probability
of
her
being
married
he
considers
how
often
he
had
found
her
with
that
happy
young
man
who
more
freely
entertained
her
than
servants
use
to
do
he
now
considers
how
he
had
seen
them
once
on
a
bed
together
when
was
in
the
disorder
of
a
yielding
mistress
and
of
a
ravished
lover
he
considers
how
he
has
found
them
alone
at
cards
and
dice
and
often
entertaining
her
with
freedoms
of
a
husband
and
how
he
wholly
managed
her
affairs
commanded
her
servants
like
their
proper
master
and
was
in
full
authority
of
all
these
and
a
thousand
more
circumstances
confirm
in
all
his
fears
a
thousand
times
she
is
about
to
speak
but
either
fear
to
lose
by
clear
confession
or
to
run
herself
into
farther
error
by
denying
the
matter
of
fact
stops
her
words
and
she
only
blushes
and
sighs
at
what
she
dares
not
tell
and
if
by
chance
their
speaking
eyes
meet
they
would
both
decline
them
hastily
again
as
afraid
to
find
there
what
their
language
could
not
confess
sometimes
he
would
press
her
hand
and
ah
you
have
undone
my
quiet
to
which
she
would
return
no
answer
but
sigh
and
now
rising
from
the
couch
she
walked
about
the
chamber
as
sad
and
silent
as
death
attending
when
he
should
have
advanced
in
speaking
to
her
though
she
dreads
the
voice
she
wishes
to
hear
and
he
waits
for
her
reply
though
the
mouth
that
he
adores
should
deliver
poison
and
daggers
to
his
heart
while
thus
they
remained
in
the
most
silent
and
sad
entertainment
that
ever
was
between
lovers
that
had
so
much
to
say
the
page
which
only
trusts
to
wait
brought
him
this
letter
brilliard
octavio
i
am
too
sensible
of
my
many
high
offences
to
your
lordship
and
have
as
much
penitence
for
my
sin
committed
towards
you
as
it
is
possible
to
conceive
but
when
i
implore
a
pardon
from
a
lover
who
by
his
own
passion
may
guess
at
the
violent
effects
of
my
despairing
flame
i
am
yet
so
vain
to
hope
it
gave
me
the
intelligence
of
your
design
and
raised
me
up
to
a
madness
that
hurried
me
to
that
barbarity
against
your
unspotted
honour
i
own
the
baseness
of
the
fact
but
lovers
are
not
my
lord
always
guided
by
rules
of
justice
and
reason
or
if
i
had
i
should
have
killed
the
fair
adulteress
that
drew
you
to
your
undoing
and
who
merits
more
your
hate
than
your
regard
and
who
having
first
violated
her
to
me
with
would
sacrifice
us
both
to
you
and
at
the
same
time
betray
you
to
a
marriage
that
can
not
but
prove
fatal
to
you
as
it
is
most
unlawful
in
her
so
that
my
lord
if
i
have
injured
you
i
have
at
the
same
time
saved
you
from
a
sin
and
ruin
and
humbly
implore
that
you
will
suffer
the
good
i
have
rendered
you
in
the
last
to
atone
for
the
ill
i
did
you
in
the
first
if
i
have
accused
you
of
a
design
against
the
state
it
was
to
save
you
from
that
of
the
too
subtle
and
too
charming
which
none
but
myself
could
have
snatched
you
from
it
is
true
i
might
have
acted
something
more
worthy
of
my
birth
and
education
but
my
lord
i
knew
the
power
of
and
if
i
should
have
sent
you
the
knowledge
of
this
when
i
sent
the
warrant
for
the
security
of
your
person
the
haughty
creature
would
have
prevailed
above
all
my
truths
with
the
eloquence
of
love
and
you
had
yielded
and
been
betrayed
worse
by
her
than
by
the
most
ungenerous
measures
i
took
to
prevent
it
suffer
this
reason
my
lord
to
plead
for
me
in
that
heart
where
reigns
and
shews
how
powerful
she
is
every
where
pardon
all
the
faults
of
a
most
unfortunate
man
undone
by
love
and
by
your
own
guess
what
his
passion
would
put
him
on
who
aims
or
wishes
at
least
for
the
entire
possession
of
though
it
was
never
absolutely
hoped
by
the
most
unfortunate
brilliard
at
the
beginning
of
this
letter
hoped
it
contained
the
confession
of
his
fault
in
claiming
he
hoped
he
would
have
owned
it
done
in
order
to
his
service
to
his
lord
or
his
love
to
or
any
thing
but
what
it
really
was
but
when
he
read
on
and
found
that
he
yet
confirmed
his
claim
he
yielded
to
all
the
grief
that
could
sink
a
heart
with
violent
love
he
fell
down
on
the
couch
where
he
was
sat
and
only
calling
with
a
dying
groan
he
held
out
his
hand
in
which
the
letter
remained
and
looked
on
her
with
eyes
that
languished
with
death
love
and
despair
while
she
who
already
feared
from
whom
it
came
received
it
with
disdain
shame
and
confusion
and
recovering
a
little
cried
in
a
faint
voice
see
charming
cruel
fair
see
how
much
my
soul
adores
you
when
even
this
can
not
extinguish
one
spark
of
the
flame
you
have
kindled
in
my
at
this
she
blushed
and
bowed
with
a
graceful
modesty
that
was
like
to
have
given
the
lie
to
all
the
accusations
against
her
she
reads
the
letter
while
he
greedily
fixes
his
eyes
upon
her
face
as
she
reads
observing
with
curious
search
every
motion
there
all
killing
and
adorable
he
saw
her
blushes
sometimes
rise
then
sink
again
to
their
proper
fountain
her
heart
there
swell
and
rise
and
beat
against
her
breast
that
had
no
other
covering
than
a
thin
shirt
for
all
her
bosom
was
open
and
betrayed
the
nimble
motion
of
her
heart
her
eyes
sometimes
would
sparkle
with
disdain
and
glow
upon
the
fatal
lines
and
sometimes
languish
with
excess
of
grief
but
having
concluded
the
letter
she
laid
it
on
the
table
and
began
again
to
traverse
the
room
her
head
declined
and
her
arms
her
bosom
made
too
true
an
interpretation
of
this
silence
and
calm
in
and
no
longer
doubted
his
fate
he
fixes
his
eyes
eternally
upon
her
while
she
considers
what
she
shall
say
to
that
afflicted
lover
she
considers
lost
or
if
he
ever
returns
it
is
not
to
love
to
that
he
was
for
ever
gone
for
too
well
she
knew
no
arts
obligations
or
industry
could
retrieve
a
flying
she
found
if
even
that
could
return
his
whole
fortune
was
so
exhausted
he
could
not
support
her
and
that
she
was
of
a
nature
so
haughty
and
impatient
of
injuries
that
she
could
never
forgive
him
those
affronts
he
had
done
her
honour
first
and
now
her
love
she
resolves
no
law
or
force
shall
submit
her
to
she
finds
this
fallacy
she
had
put
on
has
ruined
her
credit
in
his
esteem
at
least
she
justly
fears
it
so
that
believing
herself
abandoned
by
all
in
a
strange
country
she
fell
to
weeping
her
fate
and
the
tears
wet
the
floor
as
she
walked
at
which
sight
so
melting
starts
from
the
couch
and
catching
her
in
his
trembling
arms
he
cried
be
false
be
cruel
and
deceitful
yet
still
i
must
i
am
compelled
to
adore
you
this
being
spoken
in
so
hearty
and
resolved
a
tone
from
a
man
of
whose
heart
she
was
so
sure
and
knew
to
be
generous
gave
her
a
little
courage
and
like
sinking
men
she
catches
at
all
that
presents
her
any
hope
of
escaping
she
resolves
by
discovering
the
whole
truth
to
save
that
last
stake
his
heart
though
she
could
pretend
to
no
more
and
taking
the
fainting
lover
by
the
hand
she
leads
him
to
the
couch
well
said
she
you
are
too
generous
to
be
imposed
on
in
any
thing
and
therefore
i
will
tell
you
my
heart
without
reserve
as
absolutely
as
to
heaven
itself
if
i
were
interceding
my
last
peace
she
begged
a
thousand
pardons
of
him
for
having
concealed
any
part
of
her
story
from
him
but
she
could
no
longer
be
guilty
of
that
crime
to
a
man
for
whom
she
had
so
perfect
a
passion
and
as
she
spoke
she
embraced
him
with
an
irresistible
softness
that
wholly
charmed
him
she
reconciles
him
with
every
touch
and
sighs
on
his
bosom
a
thousand
grateful
vows
and
excuses
for
her
fault
while
he
weeps
his
love
and
almost
expires
in
her
arms
she
is
not
able
to
see
his
passion
and
his
grief
and
tells
him
she
will
do
all
things
for
his
repose
ah
sighed
he
not
of
my
repose
when
you
confess
yourself
wife
to
one
and
mistress
to
another
in
either
of
which
i
have
alas
no
part
ah
what
is
reserved
for
the
unfortunate
when
two
happy
lovers
divide
the
treasure
of
his
soul
yet
tell
me
truth
because
it
will
look
like
love
shew
me
that
excellent
virtue
so
rarely
found
in
all
your
fickle
sex
o
tell
me
truth
and
let
me
know
how
much
my
heart
can
bear
before
it
break
with
love
and
yet
perhaps
to
hear
thee
speak
to
me
with
that
insinuating
dear
voice
of
thine
may
save
me
from
the
terror
of
thy
words
and
though
each
make
a
wound
their
very
accents
have
a
balm
to
heal
o
quickly
pour
it
then
into
my
listening
soul
and
i
will
be
silent
as
lovers
whom
joys
have
charmed
to
tender
sighs
and
at
this
embracing
her
anew
he
let
fall
a
shower
of
tears
upon
her
bosom
and
sighing
cried
now
i
attend
thy
story
she
then
began
anew
the
repetition
of
the
loves
between
herself
and
which
she
slightly
ran
over
because
he
had
already
heard
every
circumstance
of
it
both
from
herself
and
till
she
arrived
to
that
part
of
it
where
she
left
her
father
s
house
thus
far
said
she
you
have
had
a
faithful
relation
and
i
was
no
sooner
missed
by
my
parents
but
you
may
imagine
the
diligent
search
that
would
be
made
both
by
whom
i
was
to
have
married
the
next
day
and
my
tender
parents
but
all
search
all
were
vain
at
last
they
put
me
into
the
weekly
describing
me
to
the
very
features
of
my
face
my
hair
my
breast
my
stature
youth
and
beauty
omitting
nothing
that
might
render
me
apparent
to
all
that
should
see
me
offering
vast
sums
to
any
that
should
give
intelligence
of
such
a
lost
maid
of
quality
who
understood
too
well
the
nature
of
the
common
people
and
that
they
would
betray
their
very
fathers
for
such
a
proffered
sum
durst
trust
me
no
longer
to
their
mercy
his
affairs
were
so
involved
with
those
of
he
could
not
leave
for
they
every
moment
expected
the
people
should
rise
against
their
king
and
those
glorious
chiefs
of
the
faction
were
obliged
to
wait
and
watch
the
motions
of
the
dirty
crowd
nor
durst
he
trust
me
in
any
place
from
him
for
he
could
not
live
a
day
without
me
at
that
thought
she
sighed
and
then
went
on
so
that
i
was
obliged
to
remain
obscurely
lodged
in
where
now
i
durst
no
longer
trust
myself
though
disguised
in
as
many
shapes
as
i
was
obliged
to
have
lodgings
at
last
we
were
betrayed
and
had
only
the
short
notice
given
us
to
yield
or
secure
ourselves
from
the
hand
of
justice
by
the
next
morning
when
they
designed
to
surprise
us
to
escape
we
found
almost
impossible
and
very
hazardous
to
attempt
it
so
that
who
was
raving
with
fears
called
myself
and
this
young
gentleman
then
master
of
his
horse
and
one
that
had
served
us
faithfully
through
the
whole
course
of
our
lives
to
council
many
things
were
in
vain
debated
but
at
last
this
hard
shift
was
found
out
of
marrying
me
to
for
to
it
was
impossible
so
that
no
authority
of
a
father
could
take
me
from
the
husband
i
was
at
first
extremely
unwilling
but
when
told
me
it
was
to
be
only
a
to
secure
me
to
himself
i
was
reconciled
to
it
and
more
when
i
found
the
infinite
submission
of
the
young
man
who
vowed
he
would
never
look
up
to
me
with
the
eyes
of
a
lover
or
husband
but
in
obedience
to
his
lord
did
it
to
preserve
me
entirely
for
him
nay
farther
to
secure
my
future
fear
he
confessed
to
me
he
was
already
married
to
a
gentlewoman
by
whom
he
had
two
oh
tell
me
true
my
was
he
married
to
another
cried
out
the
overjoyed
lover
yes
on
my
life
replied
for
when
it
was
proved
in
court
that
i
was
married
to
as
at
last
i
was
and
innocently
bedded
this
lady
came
and
brought
her
children
to
me
and
falling
at
my
feet
wept
and
implored
i
would
not
own
her
husband
for
only
she
had
right
to
him
we
all
were
forced
to
discover
to
her
the
truth
of
the
matter
and
that
he
had
only
married
me
to
secure
me
from
the
rage
of
my
parents
that
if
he
were
her
husband
she
was
still
as
entirely
possessed
of
him
as
ever
and
that
he
had
advanced
her
fortune
in
what
he
had
done
for
she
should
have
him
restored
with
those
advantages
that
should
make
her
life
and
that
of
her
children
more
comfortable
and
making
both
her
and
the
children
considerable
presents
sent
her
away
very
well
satisfied
after
this
before
people
we
used
him
to
a
thousand
freedoms
but
when
alone
he
retained
his
respect
entire
however
this
used
him
to
something
more
familiarity
than
formerly
and
he
grew
to
be
more
a
companion
than
a
servant
as
indeed
we
desired
he
should
and
of
late
have
found
him
more
presumptuous
than
usual
and
thus
much
more
i
must
confess
i
have
reason
to
believe
him
a
most
passionate
lover
and
have
lately
found
he
had
designs
upon
me
as
you
well
know
now
oh
dear
how
unfortunate
i
am
yet
judge
too
whether
i
ought
to
esteem
this
a
marriage
or
him
a
husband
no
replied
more
briskly
than
before
nor
can
he
by
the
laws
of
god
or
man
pretend
to
such
a
blessing
and
you
may
be
pleased
with
this
thought
he
soon
assumed
his
native
temper
of
joy
and
softness
and
making
a
thousand
new
vows
that
he
would
perform
all
he
had
sworn
on
his
part
and
imploring
and
pressing
her
to
renew
those
she
had
made
to
him
she
obeys
him
she
makes
a
thousand
grateful
returns
and
they
pass
the
evening
the
most
happily
that
ever
lovers
did
by
this
time
supper
was
served
up
noble
and
handsome
and
after
supper
he
led
her
to
his
closet
where
he
presented
her
with
jewels
and
other
rarities
of
great
value
and
omitted
nothing
that
might
oblige
an
avaricious
designing
woman
if
had
been
such
nor
any
thing
that
might
beget
love
and
gratitude
in
the
most
insensible
heart
and
all
he
did
and
all
he
gave
was
with
a
peculiar
grace
in
which
there
lies
as
great
an
obligation
as
in
the
gift
itself
the
handsome
way
of
giving
being
an
art
so
rarely
known
even
to
the
most
generous
in
these
happy
and
glorious
moments
of
love
wherein
the
lover
omitted
nothing
that
could
please
was
almost
forgotten
for
it
is
natural
for
love
to
beget
love
and
inconstancy
its
likeness
or
disdain
and
we
must
conclude
a
maid
wholly
insensible
if
she
had
not
been
touched
with
tenderness
and
even
love
itself
at
all
these
extravagant
marks
of
passion
in
and
it
must
be
confessed
she
was
of
a
nature
soft
and
apt
for
impression
she
was
in
a
word
a
woman
she
had
her
vanities
and
her
little
foiblesses
and
loved
to
see
adorers
at
her
feet
especially
those
in
whom
all
things
all
graces
charms
of
youth
wit
and
fortune
agreed
to
form
for
love
and
conquest
she
naturally
loved
power
and
dominion
and
it
was
her
maxim
that
never
any
woman
was
displeased
to
find
she
could
beget
desire
it
was
thus
they
lived
with
uninterrupted
joys
no
spies
to
pry
upon
their
actions
no
false
friends
to
censure
their
real
pleasures
no
rivals
to
poison
their
true
content
no
parents
to
give
bounds
or
grave
rules
to
the
destruction
of
nobler
lavish
love
but
all
the
day
was
passed
in
new
delights
and
every
day
produced
a
thousand
pleasures
and
even
the
thoughts
of
revenge
were
no
more
remembered
on
either
side
it
lessened
in
heart
as
love
advanced
there
and
her
resentment
against
was
lost
in
her
growing
passion
for
and
sure
if
any
woman
had
excuses
for
loving
and
inconstancy
the
most
wise
and
prudent
must
allow
them
now
to
and
if
she
had
reason
for
loving
it
was
now
for
what
she
paid
the
most
deserving
of
his
sex
and
whom
she
managed
with
that
art
of
loving
if
there
be
art
in
love
that
she
gained
every
minute
upon
his
heart
and
he
became
more
and
more
her
slave
the
more
he
found
he
was
beloved
in
spite
of
all
pretension
he
would
have
married
her
but
durst
not
do
it
while
he
remained
in
because
of
the
noise
claim
had
made
and
he
feared
the
displeasure
of
his
uncle
but
waited
for
a
more
happy
time
when
he
could
settle
his
affairs
so
as
to
remove
her
into
though
he
could
not
tell
how
to
accomplish
that
without
ruining
his
interest
these
thoughts
alone
took
up
his
time
whenever
he
was
absent
from
and
would
often
give
him
abundance
of
trouble
for
he
was
given
over
to
his
wish
of
possessing
of
and
could
not
live
without
her
he
loved
too
much
and
thought
and
considered
too
little
these
were
his
eternal
entertainments
when
from
the
lovely
object
of
his
desire
which
was
as
seldom
as
possible
for
they
were
both
unwilling
to
part
though
decency
and
rest
required
it
a
thousand
soft
things
would
hinder
him
and
make
her
willing
to
retain
him
and
though
they
were
to
meet
again
next
morning
they
grudge
themselves
the
parting
hours
and
the
repose
of
nature
he
longs
and
languishes
for
the
blessed
moment
that
shall
give
him
to
the
arms
of
the
ravishing
and
she
finds
but
too
much
yielding
on
her
part
in
some
of
those
silent
lone
hours
when
love
was
most
prevailing
and
feeble
mortals
most
apt
to
be
overcome
by
that
insinuating
god
so
that
though
could
not
ask
what
he
sighed
and
died
for
though
for
the
safety
of
his
life
for
any
favours
and
though
on
the
other
side
resolved
she
would
not
grant
no
though
mutual
vows
had
passed
though
love
within
pleaded
and
almost
irresistible
beauties
and
inducements
without
though
all
the
powers
of
love
of
silence
night
and
opportunity
though
on
the
very
point
a
thousand
times
of
yielding
she
had
resisted
all
but
oh
one
night
let
it
not
rise
up
in
judgement
against
her
ye
bashful
modest
maids
who
never
yet
tried
any
powerful
minute
nor
ye
chaste
wives
who
give
no
opportunities
one
night
they
lost
themselves
in
dalliance
forgot
how
very
near
they
were
to
yielding
and
with
imperfect
transports
found
themselves
half
dead
with
love
clasped
in
each
other
s
arms
betrayed
by
soft
degrees
of
joy
to
all
they
wished
it
would
be
too
amorous
to
tell
you
more
to
tell
you
all
that
night
that
happy
night
produced
let
it
suffice
that
yielded
all
and
made
happier
than
a
god
at
first
he
found
her
weeping
in
his
arms
raving
on
what
she
had
inconsiderately
done
and
with
her
soft
reproaches
chiding
her
ravished
lover
who
lay
sighing
by
unable
to
reply
any
other
way
he
held
her
fast
in
those
arms
that
trembled
yet
with
love
and
joy
he
found
a
pleasure
even
in
her
railing
with
a
tenderness
that
spoke
more
love
than
any
other
language
love
could
speak
betwixt
his
sighs
he
pleads
his
right
of
love
and
the
authority
of
his
solemn
vows
he
tells
her
that
the
was
but
contrived
to
satisfy
the
ignorant
and
to
proclaim
his
title
to
the
crowd
but
vows
and
contracts
were
the
same
to
heaven
he
speaks
and
she
believes
and
well
she
might
for
all
he
spoke
was
honourable
truth
he
knew
no
guile
but
uttered
all
his
soul
and
all
that
soul
was
honest
just
and
brave
thus
by
degrees
he
brought
her
to
a
calm
in
this
soft
rencounter
he
had
discovered
a
thousand
new
charms
in
and
contrary
to
those
men
whose
end
of
love
is
lust
which
extinguish
together
found
increase
of
tenderness
from
every
bliss
she
gave
and
grew
at
last
so
fond
so
doting
on
the
still
more
charming
maid
that
he
neglected
all
his
interest
his
business
in
the
state
and
what
he
owed
his
uncle
and
his
friends
and
became
the
common
theme
over
all
the
united
provinces
for
his
wantonness
and
luxury
as
they
were
pleased
to
call
it
and
living
so
contrary
to
the
humour
of
those
more
sordid
and
slovenly
men
of
quality
which
make
up
the
nobility
of
that
parcel
of
the
world
for
while
thus
he
lived
retired
scarce
visiting
any
one
or
permitting
any
one
to
visit
him
they
charge
him
with
a
thousand
crimes
of
having
given
himself
over
to
effeminacy
as
indeed
he
grew
too
lazy
in
her
arms
neglecting
glory
arms
and
power
for
the
more
real
joys
of
life
while
she
even
rifles
him
with
extravagancy
and
grows
so
bold
and
hardy
that
regarding
not
the
humours
of
the
stingy
censorious
nation
his
interest
or
her
own
fame
she
is
seen
every
day
in
his
coaches
going
to
take
the
air
out
of
town
puts
him
upon
balls
and
vast
expensive
treats
devises
new
projects
and
ways
of
diversion
till
some
of
the
more
busy
impertinents
of
the
town
made
a
public
complaint
to
his
uncle
and
the
rest
of
the
urging
he
was
a
scandal
to
the
reverend
and
honourable
society
on
which
it
was
decreed
that
he
should
either
lose
that
honour
or
take
up
and
live
more
according
to
the
gravity
and
authority
of
a
senator
this
incensed
both
against
the
and
his
nephew
for
though
he
had
often
reproved
and
counselled
him
yet
he
scorned
his
darling
should
be
schooled
by
his
equals
in
power
so
that
resolving
either
to
discard
him
or
draw
him
from
the
love
of
this
woman
he
one
morning
goes
to
his
nephew
s
house
and
sending
him
up
word
by
his
page
he
would
speak
to
him
he
was
conducted
to
his
chamber
where
he
found
him
in
his
he
began
to
upbraid
him
first
with
his
want
of
respect
and
duty
to
him
and
next
of
his
affairs
neglecting
to
give
his
attendance
on
the
public
he
tells
him
he
is
become
a
scandal
to
the
commonwealth
and
that
he
lived
a
lewd
life
with
another
man
s
wife
he
tells
him
he
has
all
her
story
and
she
was
not
only
a
wife
but
a
scandalous
mistress
too
to
she
boasts
says
he
of
honourable
birth
but
what
is
that
when
her
conduct
is
infamous
in
short
sir
continued
he
your
life
is
obnoxious
to
the
whole
province
why
what
sir
can
not
honest
men
s
daughters
cried
he
more
angrily
serve
your
turn
but
you
must
crack
a
commandment
why
this
is
flat
adultery
a
little
fornication
in
a
civil
way
might
have
been
allowed
but
this
is
stark
naught
in
fine
sir
quit
me
this
woman
and
quit
her
presently
or
in
the
first
place
i
renounce
thee
cast
thee
from
me
as
a
stranger
and
will
leave
thee
to
ruin
and
the
incensed
a
little
pleasure
a
little
recreation
i
can
allow
a
layer
of
love
and
a
layer
of
business
but
to
neglect
the
nation
for
a
wench
is
flat
treason
against
the
state
and
i
wish
there
were
a
law
against
all
such
unreasonable
that
are
statesmen
for
the
rest
it
is
no
great
matter
therefore
in
a
word
sir
leave
me
off
this
mistress
of
yours
or
we
will
secure
her
yet
for
a
spy
that
comes
to
debauch
our
commonwealth
s
men
the
can
do
it
sir
they
can
hitherto
received
all
with
a
blush
and
bow
in
sign
of
obedience
but
when
his
uncle
told
him
the
would
send
away
his
mistress
no
longer
able
to
contain
his
rage
he
broke
out
into
all
the
violence
imaginable
against
them
and
swore
he
would
not
now
forgo
to
be
monarch
over
all
the
nasty
provinces
and
it
was
a
greater
glory
to
be
a
slave
at
her
feet
go
tell
your
cried
he
they
are
a
company
of
cynical
fops
born
to
moil
on
in
sordid
business
who
never
were
worthy
to
understand
so
great
a
happiness
of
life
as
that
of
nobler
love
tell
them
i
scorn
the
dull
gravity
of
those
asses
of
the
commonwealth
fit
only
to
bear
the
dirty
load
of
and
die
old
busy
the
uncle
who
little
expected
such
a
return
from
him
who
used
to
be
all
obedience
began
more
gently
to
persuade
him
with
more
solid
reason
but
could
get
no
other
answer
from
him
than
that
what
he
commanded
he
should
find
it
difficult
to
disobey
and
so
for
that
time
they
parted
some
days
after
he
never
coming
so
much
as
near
their
councils
they
sent
for
him
to
answer
the
contempt
he
came
and
received
abundance
of
hard
reproaches
and
finding
they
were
resolved
to
degrade
him
he
presently
rallied
them
in
answer
to
all
they
said
nor
could
all
the
cautions
of
his
friends
persuade
him
to
any
submission
after
receiving
so
rough
and
a
treatment
as
they
gave
him
and
impatient
to
return
to
where
all
his
joys
were
centred
he
was
with
much
ado
persuaded
to
stay
and
hear
the
resolution
of
the
council
which
was
to
take
from
him
those
honours
he
held
amongst
them
at
which
he
cocked
and
smiled
and
told
them
he
received
what
he
was
much
more
proud
of
than
of
those
useless
trifles
they
called
honours
and
wishes
they
might
treat
all
that
served
them
at
that
ungrateful
rate
for
he
that
had
received
a
hundred
wounds
and
lost
a
stream
of
blood
for
their
security
shall
if
he
kiss
their
wives
against
their
wills
be
banished
like
a
coward
so
hasting
from
the
council
he
got
into
his
coach
and
went
to
this
incensed
the
old
gentlemen
to
a
high
degree
and
they
carried
it
against
the
younger
party
because
more
in
number
that
this
lady
who
was
for
as
they
called
it
forced
to
fly
should
be
no
longer
protected
in
and
in
order
to
her
removal
or
rather
their
revenge
on
they
sent
out
their
warrant
to
apprehend
her
and
either
to
send
her
as
an
enemy
to
or
force
her
to
some
other
part
of
the
world
for
a
day
or
two
interest
prevailed
for
the
stopping
the
warrant
believing
he
should
be
able
to
bring
his
nephew
to
some
submission
which
when
he
found
in
vain
he
betook
himself
to
his
chamber
and
refused
any
visits
or
diversions
by
this
time
rallying
the
was
become
the
jest
of
the
town
and
all
the
sparks
laughed
at
them
as
they
passed
and
lampooned
them
to
damnable
tunes
which
so
highly
incensed
them
that
they
sent
immediately
and
served
the
warrant
on
whom
they
surprised
in
coach
as
she
was
coming
from
taking
the
air
you
may
imagine
what
an
agony
of
trouble
and
grief
our
generous
and
surprised
lover
was
in
it
was
in
vain
to
make
resistance
and
he
who
before
would
not
have
submitted
to
have
saved
his
life
to
the
now
for
the
preservation
of
one
moment
s
content
to
was
ready
to
go
and
fall
at
their
feet
kiss
their
shoes
and
implore
their
pity
he
first
accompanies
her
to
the
house
of
the
messenger
where
he
only
is
permitted
to
behold
her
with
eyes
of
dying
love
and
unable
to
say
any
thing
to
her
left
her
with
such
gifts
and
charge
to
the
messenger
s
care
as
might
oblige
him
to
treat
her
well
while
less
surprised
bid
him
at
going
from
her
not
to
afflict
himself
for
any
thing
she
suffered
she
found
it
was
the
malice
of
the
peevish
old
magistrates
and
that
the
most
they
could
do
to
her
was
to
send
her
from
him
this
last
she
spoke
with
a
sigh
that
pierced
his
heart
more
sensibly
than
ever
any
thing
yet
had
done
and
he
only
replied
with
a
sigh
no
no
rigid
power
on
earth
shall
ever
be
able
to
deprive
you
of
my
eternal
adoration
or
to
separate
me
one
moment
from
after
she
is
compelled
to
leave
this
ungrateful
place
and
whose
departure
i
will
hasten
all
that
i
can
since
the
land
is
not
worthy
of
so
great
a
so
leaving
her
for
a
little
space
he
hasted
to
his
uncle
whom
he
found
very
much
discontented
he
throws
himself
at
his
feet
and
assails
him
with
all
the
moving
eloquence
of
sighs
and
tears
in
vain
was
all
in
vain
alas
he
pleads
from
this
he
flies
to
rage
and
says
all
a
distracted
lover
could
pour
forth
to
ease
a
tortured
heart
what
divinity
did
he
not
provoke
wholly
regardless
even
of
heaven
and
man
he
made
a
public
confession
of
his
passion
denied
her
being
married
to
and
weeps
as
he
protests
her
innocence
he
kneels
again
implores
and
begs
anew
and
made
the
movingest
moan
that
ever
touched
a
heart
but
could
receive
no
other
return
but
threats
and
frowns
the
old
gentleman
had
never
been
in
love
since
he
was
born
no
not
enough
to
marry
but
bore
an
unaccountable
hate
to
the
whole
sex
and
therefore
was
pitiless
to
all
he
could
say
on
the
score
of
love
though
he
endeavours
to
soften
him
by
a
thousand
things
more
dear
to
him
for
my
sake
sir
said
he
ever
my
lost
plea
were
grateful
to
you
when
all
your
joy
was
in
the
young
release
release
the
charming
regard
her
tender
youth
her
blooming
beauty
her
timorous
helpless
sex
her
noble
quality
and
save
her
from
rude
assaults
of
power
oh
save
the
lovely
maid
thus
he
uttered
with
interrupting
sighs
and
tears
which
fell
upon
the
floor
as
he
pursued
the
obdurate
on
his
knees
at
last
pity
touched
his
heart
and
he
said
spare
sir
the
character
of
your
enchanting
for
i
have
heard
too
much
of
her
and
what
mischief
she
has
bred
in
abandoning
her
honour
betraying
a
virtuous
sister
defaming
her
noble
parents
and
ruining
an
illustrious
young
nobleman
who
was
both
her
brother
and
her
lover
this
sir
in
short
is
the
character
of
your
beauteous
sir
replied
you
never
saw
this
maid
or
if
you
had
you
would
not
be
so
go
to
sir
replied
the
old
gentleman
i
am
not
so
soon
softened
at
the
sight
of
but
do
but
see
her
sir
replied
and
then
perhaps
you
will
be
charmed
like
me
you
are
a
fop
sir
replied
and
if
you
would
have
me
allow
any
favour
to
your
enchanting
lady
you
must
promise
me
first
to
abandon
her
and
marry
the
widow
of
monsieur
who
is
vastly
rich
and
whom
i
have
so
often
recommended
to
you
she
loves
you
too
and
though
she
be
not
fair
she
has
the
best
fortune
of
any
lady
in
the
on
these
terms
sir
i
am
for
a
reconciliation
with
you
and
will
immediately
go
and
deliver
the
fair
prisoner
and
she
shall
have
her
liberty
to
go
or
stay
or
do
what
she
please
and
now
sir
you
know
my
will
and
pleasure
found
it
in
vain
to
pursue
him
any
farther
with
his
petitions
only
replied
it
was
wondrous
hard
and
cruel
to
which
the
old
one
replied
it
is
what
must
be
done
i
have
resolved
it
or
my
estate
in
value
above
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
shall
be
disposed
of
to
your
sister
the
countess
of
and
this
he
ended
with
an
execration
on
himself
if
he
did
not
do
and
he
was
a
man
that
always
was
just
to
his
word
much
more
to
this
ungrateful
effect
he
spoke
and
had
recourse
to
all
the
dissimulation
his
generous
soul
was
capable
of
and
it
was
the
first
base
thing
and
sure
the
last
that
ever
he
was
guilty
of
he
promises
his
uncle
to
obey
all
his
commands
and
injunctions
since
he
would
have
it
so
and
only
begged
he
might
be
permitted
but
one
visit
to
take
his
last
leave
of
her
this
was
at
first
refused
but
at
last
provided
he
might
hear
what
he
said
to
her
he
would
suffer
him
to
go
for
said
the
crafty
old
man
who
knew
too
well
the
cunning
of
youth
i
will
have
no
tricks
put
upon
me
i
will
not
be
outwitted
by
a
young
knave
this
was
the
worst
part
of
all
he
knew
if
he
alone
could
speak
with
her
they
might
have
contrived
by
handsome
agreeing
flattery
to
have
accomplished
their
design
which
was
first
by
the
authority
of
the
old
gentleman
to
have
freed
her
from
confinement
and
next
to
have
settled
his
affairs
in
the
best
posture
he
could
and
without
valuing
his
uncle
s
fortune
his
own
being
greater
he
resolved
to
go
with
her
into
or
but
his
going
with
him
to
visit
her
would
prevent
whatever
they
might
resolve
but
since
the
liberty
of
was
first
to
be
considered
he
resolves
since
it
must
be
so
and
leaves
the
rest
to
time
and
his
good
fortune
well
then
sir
said
since
you
have
resolved
yourself
to
be
a
witness
of
those
melancholy
things
i
shall
possibly
say
to
her
let
us
haste
to
end
the
great
affair
hang
it
cried
if
i
go
i
shall
abuse
the
young
hussy
or
commit
some
indecency
that
will
not
be
suitable
to
good
manners
i
hope
you
will
sir
replied
whip
them
whip
them
replied
the
uncle
i
hate
the
young
cozening
baggages
that
wander
about
the
world
undoing
young
and
extravagant
coxcombs
gots
so
they
are
naught
stark
naught
be
sure
dispatch
as
soon
as
you
can
and
do
you
hear
let
s
have
no
overjoyed
he
should
have
her
released
promised
lavishly
all
he
was
urged
to
and
his
coach
being
at
the
gate
they
both
went
immediately
to
the
house
of
the
messenger
all
the
way
the
old
gentleman
did
nothing
but
rail
against
the
vices
of
the
age
and
the
sins
of
villainous
youth
the
snares
of
beauty
and
the
danger
of
witty
women
and
of
how
ill
consequences
these
were
to
a
commonwealth
he
said
if
he
were
to
make
laws
he
would
confine
all
young
women
to
monasteries
where
they
should
never
see
man
till
forty
and
then
come
out
and
marry
for
no
more
for
his
part
he
had
never
seen
the
beauty
that
yet
could
inspire
him
with
that
silly
thing
called
love
and
wondered
what
the
devil
ailed
all
the
young
fellows
of
this
age
that
they
talked
of
nothing
else
at
this
rate
they
discoursed
till
they
arrived
at
the
prison
and
calling
for
the
messenger
he
conducted
them
both
to
the
chamber
of
the
fair
prisoner
who
was
laid
on
a
couch
near
which
stood
a
table
with
two
candles
which
gave
a
great
light
to
that
part
of
the
room
and
made
appear
more
fair
than
ever
if
possible
she
had
not
that
day
been
dressed
but
in
a
rich
and
cornets
of
the
most
advantageous
fashion
at
his
approach
she
blushed
with
a
secret
joy
which
never
had
possessed
her
soul
for
him
before
and
spread
a
thousand
beauties
round
her
fair
face
she
was
leaping
with
a
transported
pleasure
to
his
arms
when
she
perceived
an
old
grave
person
follow
him
into
the
room
at
which
she
reassumed
a
strangeness
a
melancholy
languishment
which
charmed
no
less
than
her
gaiety
she
approaches
them
with
a
modest
grace
in
her
beautiful
eyes
and
by
the
reception
gave
her
she
found
that
reverend
person
was
his
uncle
or
at
least
somebody
of
authority
and
therefore
assuming
a
gravity
unusual
she
received
them
with
all
the
ceremony
due
to
their
quality
and
first
she
addressed
herself
to
the
old
gentleman
who
stood
gazing
at
her
without
motion
at
which
she
was
a
little
out
of
countenance
when
perceiving
it
approached
his
uncle
and
cried
sir
this
is
the
lady
starting
as
from
a
dream
cried
pardon
me
madam
i
am
a
fellow
whom
age
hath
rendered
less
ceremonious
than
youth
i
have
never
yet
been
so
happy
as
to
have
been
used
to
a
fair
lady
women
never
took
up
one
minute
of
my
more
precious
time
but
i
have
been
a
satyr
upon
the
whole
sex
and
if
my
treatment
of
you
be
rougher
than
your
birth
and
beauty
merits
i
beseech
you
fair
creature
pardon
it
since
i
come
in
order
to
do
you
sir
replied
blushing
with
anger
at
the
presence
of
a
man
who
had
contributed
to
the
having
brought
her
to
that
place
i
can
not
but
wonder
at
this
sudden
change
of
goodness
in
a
person
to
whom
i
am
indebted
for
part
of
my
misfortune
and
which
i
shall
no
longer
esteem
as
such
since
it
has
occasioned
me
a
happiness
and
an
honour
to
which
i
could
no
other
way
have
this
last
she
spoke
with
her
usual
insinuating
charms
the
little
affectation
of
the
voice
sweetened
to
all
the
tenderness
it
was
possible
to
put
on
and
so
easy
and
natural
to
and
if
before
the
old
gentleman
were
seized
with
some
unusual
pleasure
which
before
he
never
felt
about
his
icy
and
insensible
heart
and
which
now
began
to
thaw
at
the
fire
of
her
eyes
i
say
if
before
he
were
surprised
with
looking
what
was
he
when
she
spoke
with
a
voice
so
soft
and
an
air
so
bewitching
he
was
all
eyes
and
ears
and
had
use
of
no
other
sense
but
what
informed
those
he
gazes
upon
her
as
if
he
waited
and
listened
what
she
would
farther
say
and
she
stood
waiting
for
his
reply
till
ashamed
she
turned
her
eyes
into
her
bosom
and
knew
not
how
to
proceed
views
both
by
turns
and
knows
not
how
to
begin
the
discourse
again
it
being
his
uncle
s
cue
to
speak
but
finding
him
altogether
mute
he
steps
to
him
and
gently
pulled
him
by
the
sleeve
but
finds
no
motion
in
him
he
speaks
to
him
but
in
vain
for
he
could
hear
nothing
but
charming
voice
nor
saw
nothing
but
her
lovely
face
nor
attended
any
thing
but
when
she
would
speak
again
and
look
that
way
at
this
smiled
and
taking
his
adorable
by
the
hand
he
led
her
nearer
her
admiring
adversary
whom
she
approached
with
modesty
and
sweetness
in
her
eyes
that
the
old
fellow
having
never
before
beheld
the
like
vision
was
wholly
vanquished
and
his
old
heart
burnt
in
the
socket
which
being
his
last
blaze
made
the
greater
fire
fine
lady
cried
he
or
rather
fine
angel
how
is
it
i
shall
expiate
for
a
barbarity
that
nothing
could
be
guilty
of
but
the
brute
who
had
not
learned
humanity
from
your
eyes
what
atonement
can
i
make
for
my
sin
and
how
shall
i
be
punished
sir
replied
if
i
can
merit
your
esteem
and
assistance
to
deliver
me
from
this
cruel
confinement
i
shall
think
of
what
is
past
as
a
joy
since
it
renders
me
worthy
of
your
pity
and
to
answer
you
madam
were
to
hold
you
under
this
unworthy
roof
too
long
therefore
let
me
convince
you
of
my
service
by
leading
you
to
a
place
more
fit
for
so
fair
a
and
calling
for
the
messenger
he
asked
him
if
he
would
take
his
bail
for
his
fair
prisoner
who
replied
your
lordship
may
command
all
things
so
throwing
him
a
little
purse
about
thirty
pounds
in
gold
he
bid
him
drink
the
lady
s
health
and
without
more
ceremony
or
talk
led
her
to
the
coach
and
never
so
much
as
asking
her
whether
she
would
go
insensibly
carries
her
where
he
had
a
mind
to
have
her
to
his
own
house
this
was
a
little
affliction
to
who
nevertheless
durst
not
say
any
thing
to
his
uncle
nor
so
much
as
ask
him
the
reason
why
but
being
arrived
all
thither
he
conducts
her
to
a
very
fair
apartment
and
bid
her
there
command
that
world
he
could
command
for
her
he
gave
her
there
a
very
magnificent
supper
and
all
three
supped
together
could
not
imagine
that
his
uncle
who
was
a
single
man
and
a
grave
senator
one
famed
for
a
womanhater
a
great
railer
at
the
vices
of
young
men
should
keep
a
fair
young
single
woman
in
his
house
but
it
growing
late
and
no
preparation
for
her
departing
she
took
the
courage
to
say
sir
i
am
so
extremely
obliged
to
you
and
have
received
so
great
a
favour
from
you
that
i
can
not
flatter
myself
it
is
for
any
virtue
in
me
or
merely
out
of
compassion
to
my
sex
that
you
have
done
this
but
for
some
body
s
sake
to
whom
i
am
more
engaged
than
i
am
aware
of
and
when
you
passed
your
parole
for
my
liberty
i
am
not
so
vain
to
think
it
was
for
my
sake
therefore
pray
inform
me
sir
how
i
can
pay
this
debt
and
to
whom
and
who
it
is
you
require
should
be
bound
for
me
to
save
you
madam
cried
though
there
need
no
greater
security
than
your
own
innocence
yet
lest
that
innocence
should
not
be
sufficient
to
guard
you
from
the
outrage
of
a
people
approaching
to
savages
i
beg
for
your
own
security
not
mine
that
you
will
make
this
house
your
sanctuary
my
power
can
save
you
from
impending
harms
and
all
that
i
call
mine
you
shall
at
this
she
blushing
bowed
but
durst
not
make
reply
to
contradict
him
she
knew
at
least
that
there
she
was
safe
and
well
from
fear
of
the
tyranny
of
the
rest
or
any
other
apprehension
it
is
true
she
found
by
the
shyness
of
towards
her
before
his
uncle
that
she
was
to
manage
her
amour
with
him
by
stealth
till
they
could
contrive
matters
more
to
their
advantage
she
therefore
finding
she
should
want
nothing
but
as
much
of
conversation
as
she
desired
she
begged
he
would
give
her
leave
to
write
a
note
to
her
page
who
was
a
faithful
sober
youth
to
bring
her
jewels
and
what
things
she
had
of
value
to
her
which
he
did
and
received
those
and
her
servants
together
but
had
like
to
have
lost
her
place
but
that
pleaded
for
her
and
she
herself
confessing
it
was
love
to
the
false
that
made
her
do
that
foolish
thing
in
which
she
vowed
she
thought
no
harm
though
it
was
like
to
have
cost
her
so
dear
she
was
again
received
into
favour
so
that
for
some
days
found
herself
very
much
at
her
ease
with
the
old
gentleman
and
had
no
want
of
any
thing
but
company
but
she
had
the
pleasure
to
find
by
his
eyes
and
sighs
he
wanted
hers
more
he
died
every
day
and
his
fair
face
faded
like
falling
roses
still
she
was
gay
for
if
she
had
it
not
about
her
she
assumed
it
to
keep
him
in
heart
she
was
not
displeased
to
see
the
old
man
on
fire
too
and
fancied
some
diversion
from
the
intrigue
but
he
concealed
his
passion
all
he
could
both
to
hide
it
from
his
nephew
and
because
he
knew
not
what
he
ailed
a
strange
change
he
found
a
wondrous
disorder
in
nature
but
could
not
give
a
name
to
it
nor
sigh
aloud
for
fear
he
should
be
heard
and
lose
his
reputation
especially
for
this
woman
on
whom
he
had
railed
so
lavishly
one
day
therefore
after
a
night
of
torment
very
incommode
to
his
age
he
takes
into
the
garden
alone
telling
him
he
had
a
great
secret
to
impart
to
him
guessing
what
it
might
be
put
his
heart
in
as
good
order
as
he
could
to
receive
it
he
at
least
knew
the
worst
was
but
for
him
at
last
to
steal
from
him
if
he
should
be
weak
enough
to
dote
on
the
young
charmer
and
therefore
resolved
to
hear
with
patience
but
if
he
were
prepared
to
attend
the
other
was
not
prepared
to
begin
and
so
both
walked
many
silent
turns
about
the
garden
had
a
mind
to
ask
a
thousand
questions
of
his
nephew
who
he
found
maugre
all
his
vows
of
deserting
had
no
power
of
doing
it
he
had
a
mind
to
urge
him
to
marry
the
widow
but
durst
not
now
press
it
though
he
used
to
do
so
lest
he
should
take
it
for
jealousy
in
him
nor
durst
he
now
forbid
him
seeing
her
lest
he
should
betray
the
secrets
of
his
soul
he
began
every
moment
to
love
him
less
as
he
loved
more
and
beholds
him
as
an
enemy
to
his
repose
nay
his
very
life
at
last
the
old
man
who
thought
if
he
brought
his
nephew
forth
under
pretence
of
a
secret
and
said
nothing
to
him
it
would
have
looked
ill
began
to
speak
said
he
i
have
hitherto
found
you
so
just
in
all
you
have
said
that
it
were
a
sin
to
doubt
you
in
what
relates
to
you
have
told
me
she
is
nobly
born
and
you
have
with
infinite
imprecations
convinced
me
she
is
virtuous
and
lastly
you
have
sworn
she
was
not
married
at
this
he
sighed
and
paused
and
left
trembling
with
fear
of
the
result
a
thousand
times
he
was
like
to
have
denied
all
but
durst
not
defame
the
most
sacred
idol
of
his
soul
sometimes
he
thought
his
uncle
would
be
generous
and
think
it
fit
to
give
him
but
that
thought
was
too
seraphic
to
remain
a
moment
in
his
heart
sir
replied
i
own
i
said
so
of
and
hope
no
action
she
has
committed
since
she
had
a
protection
under
your
roof
has
contradicted
any
thing
i
said
no
said
sighing
and
pausing
as
loath
to
speak
more
sir
said
i
suppose
this
is
not
the
secret
you
had
to
impart
to
me
for
which
you
separate
me
to
this
lonely
walk
fear
not
to
trust
me
with
it
whatever
it
be
for
i
am
so
entirely
your
own
that
i
will
grant
submit
prostrate
myself
and
give
up
all
my
will
power
and
faculties
to
your
interest
or
this
encouraged
the
old
lover
who
replied
tell
me
one
truth
which
i
require
of
you
and
i
will
desire
no
more
have
not
you
had
the
possession
of
this
fair
maid
you
apprehend
now
it
was
that
he
feared
what
design
the
amorous
old
gentleman
had
in
his
head
and
heart
and
was
at
a
loss
what
to
say
whether
to
give
him
some
jealousy
that
he
had
known
and
possessed
her
and
so
prevent
his
designs
on
her
or
by
saying
he
had
not
to
leave
her
defenceless
to
his
love
but
on
second
thoughts
he
could
not
resolve
to
say
any
thing
to
the
disadvantage
of
though
to
save
his
own
life
and
therefore
assured
his
uncle
he
never
durst
assume
the
boldness
to
ask
so
rude
a
question
of
a
woman
of
quality
and
much
more
he
spoke
to
that
purpose
to
convince
him
that
it
is
true
he
would
have
married
her
if
he
could
have
gained
his
consent
maugre
all
the
scandal
that
the
malicious
world
had
thrown
upon
her
but
since
he
was
positive
in
his
command
for
the
widow
he
would
bend
his
mind
to
obedience
in
that
replied
you
are
wise
and
i
am
glad
all
your
youthful
fires
are
blown
over
and
having
once
fixed
you
in
the
world
as
i
design
i
have
resolved
on
an
affair
at
this
again
he
paused
i
am
says
he
in
love
i
think
it
is
love
or
that
which
you
call
so
i
can
not
eat
nor
sleep
nor
even
pray
but
this
fair
stranger
interposes
or
if
by
chance
i
slumber
all
my
dreams
are
of
her
i
see
her
i
touch
her
i
embrace
her
and
find
a
pleasure
even
then
that
all
my
waking
thoughts
could
never
procure
me
if
i
go
to
the
i
mind
nothing
there
my
heart
s
at
home
with
the
young
gentlewoman
or
the
change
or
wheresoever
i
go
my
restless
thoughts
present
her
still
before
me
and
prithee
tell
me
is
not
this
love
it
may
arrive
to
love
replied
the
blushing
youth
if
you
would
fondly
give
way
to
it
but
you
are
wise
and
grave
should
hate
all
women
sir
till
about
forty
and
then
for
generation
only
you
are
above
the
follies
of
vain
youth
and
let
me
tell
you
sir
without
offending
already
you
are
charged
with
a
thousand
little
vanities
unsuitable
to
your
years
and
the
character
you
have
had
and
the
figure
you
have
made
in
the
world
i
heard
a
lampoon
on
you
the
other
day
pardon
my
freedom
sir
for
keeping
a
beauty
in
your
house
who
they
are
pleased
to
say
was
my
mistress
and
pulling
out
a
lampoon
which
his
page
had
before
given
him
he
gave
it
his
uncle
but
instead
of
making
him
resolve
to
quit
it
only
served
to
incense
him
against
he
railed
at
all
wits
and
swore
there
was
not
a
more
dangerous
enemy
to
a
civil
sober
commonwealth
that
a
poet
was
to
be
banished
as
a
spy
or
hanged
as
a
traitor
that
it
ought
to
be
as
much
against
the
law
to
let
them
live
as
to
shoot
with
white
powder
and
that
to
write
lampoons
should
be
put
into
the
statute
against
stabbing
and
could
he
find
the
rogue
that
had
the
wit
to
write
that
he
would
make
him
a
warning
to
all
the
race
of
that
damnable
vermin
what
to
abuse
a
magistrate
one
of
the
a
very
monarch
of
the
commonwealth
it
was
abominable
and
not
to
be
borne
and
looking
on
his
nephew
and
considering
his
face
a
while
he
cried
i
fancy
sir
by
your
physiognomy
that
you
yourself
have
a
hand
in
this
libel
at
which
octavio
blushed
which
he
taking
for
guilt
flew
out
into
terrible
anger
against
him
not
suffering
him
to
speak
for
himself
or
clear
his
innocence
and
as
he
was
going
in
this
rage
from
him
having
forbidden
him
ever
to
set
his
foot
within
his
doors
he
told
him
if
said
he
the
scandalous
town
from
your
instructions
have
such
thoughts
of
me
i
will
convince
it
by
marrying
this
fair
stranger
the
first
thing
i
do
i
can
not
doubt
but
to
find
a
welcome
since
she
is
a
banished
woman
without
friends
or
protection
and
especially
when
she
shall
see
how
civilly
you
have
handled
her
here
in
your
doggerel
ballad
i
will
teach
you
to
be
a
wit
sir
and
so
your
humble
and
leaving
him
almost
wild
with
his
fears
he
went
directly
to
where
he
told
her
his
nephew
was
going
to
make
up
the
match
between
himself
and
madam
the
widow
of
and
that
he
had
made
a
scandalous
lampoon
on
her
fair
self
he
forgot
nothing
that
might
make
her
hate
the
amiable
young
nobleman
whom
she
knew
too
well
to
believe
that
any
thing
of
this
was
other
than
the
effects
of
his
own
growing
passion
for
her
for
though
she
saw
every
day
in
this
time
she
had
remained
at
his
uncle
s
yet
the
old
lover
so
watched
their
very
looks
that
it
was
impossible
almost
to
tell
one
another
s
heart
by
the
glance
there
but
had
once
in
this
time
conveyed
a
letter
to
her
which
having
opportunity
to
do
he
put
it
into
her
when
he
was
with
his
uncle
one
day
in
her
for
she
durst
not
trust
her
page
and
less
who
had
before
betrayed
them
and
having
for
release
so
solemnly
sworn
to
his
uncle
to
which
vows
he
took
religious
care
to
keep
him
he
had
so
perfect
an
awe
upon
his
spirits
from
every
look
and
command
of
his
uncle
s
he
took
infinite
heed
how
he
gave
him
any
umbrage
by
any
action
of
his
and
the
rather
because
he
hoped
when
time
should
serve
to
bring
about
his
business
of
stealing
from
him
for
she
was
kept
and
guarded
like
a
mighty
heiress
so
that
by
this
prudent
management
on
both
sides
they
heightened
the
growing
love
in
every
heart
in
that
billet
which
he
dropped
in
her
he
did
not
only
make
ten
thousand
vows
of
eternal
passion
and
faith
and
beg
the
same
assurance
of
her
again
but
told
her
he
was
secured
so
well
he
thought
of
her
from
fears
of
his
uncle
s
addresses
to
her
and
begged
she
would
not
let
them
perplex
her
but
rather
serve
her
for
her
diversion
that
she
should
from
time
to
time
write
him
all
he
said
to
her
and
how
he
treated
her
when
alone
and
that
since
the
old
lover
was
so
watchful
she
should
not
trust
her
letters
with
any
body
but
as
she
walked
into
the
garden
she
should
in
passing
through
the
hall
put
her
letter
in
at
the
broken
glass
of
an
old
sedan
that
stood
there
and
had
stood
for
several
years
and
that
his
own
page
whom
he
could
trust
should
when
he
came
with
him
to
his
uncle
s
take
it
from
thence
thus
every
day
they
writ
and
received
the
dearest
returns
in
the
world
where
all
the
satisfaction
that
vows
oft
repeated
could
give
was
rendered
each
other
with
an
account
from
that
was
very
pleasant
of
all
the
passion
of
the
doting
old
the
presents
he
made
her
the
fantastic
youth
he
would
assume
and
unusual
manner
of
his
love
which
was
a
great
diversion
to
both
and
this
difficulty
of
speaking
to
and
entertaining
her
with
love
though
it
had
its
pains
had
its
infinite
pleasure
too
it
increased
their
love
on
both
sides
and
all
their
wishes
but
now
by
this
last
banishment
from
the
house
where
she
was
to
lose
that
only
pleasure
of
beholding
the
adorable
maid
gave
him
all
the
pains
without
the
hope
of
one
pleasure
and
he
began
to
fear
he
should
have
a
world
of
difficulty
to
secure
the
dear
object
of
his
continual
thoughts
he
found
no
way
to
send
to
her
and
dreads
all
his
malicious
uncle
and
rival
may
say
to
his
disadvantage
he
dreads
even
that
infinite
tenderness
and
esteem
he
had
for
the
good
old
man
who
had
been
so
fond
a
parent
to
him
lest
even
that
should
make
him
unwilling
to
use
that
extremity
against
him
in
regaining
which
he
could
use
to
any
other
man
oh
how
he
curses
the
fatal
hour
that
ever
he
implored
his
aid
for
her
release
and
having
overcome
all
difficulties
even
that
of
his
fears
of
from
whom
they
had
received
no
letter
in
two
months
and
that
of
disdain
and
had
established
himself
in
her
soul
and
her
arms
he
should
by
employing
his
uncle
s
authority
for
service
be
so
unfortunate
to
involve
them
into
new
dangers
and
difficulties
of
which
he
could
foresee
no
other
end
than
that
which
must
be
fatal
to
some
of
them
but
he
believed
half
his
torture
would
be
eased
could
he
but
write
to
for
see
her
he
could
not
hope
he
bethought
himself
of
a
way
at
last
his
uncle
had
belonging
to
his
house
the
most
fine
garden
of
any
in
that
province
where
those
things
are
not
much
esteemed
in
which
the
old
gentleman
took
wonderful
delight
and
kept
a
gardener
and
his
family
in
a
little
house
at
the
farther
end
of
the
garden
on
purpose
to
look
to
it
and
dress
it
this
man
had
a
very
great
veneration
for
whom
he
called
his
young
lord
sure
of
the
fidelity
of
this
gardener
when
it
was
dark
enough
to
conceal
him
he
wrapped
himself
in
his
cloak
and
got
him
thither
by
a
back
way
where
with
presents
he
soon
won
those
to
his
interest
who
would
before
have
been
commanded
by
him
in
any
service
he
had
a
little
clean
room
and
some
little
novels
which
he
brought
and
there
he
was
as
well
concealed
as
if
he
had
been
in
the
he
left
word
at
home
that
he
was
gone
out
of
the
town
he
knew
well
enough
that
lodgings
looked
that
way
and
when
it
was
dark
enough
he
walked
under
her
window
till
he
saw
a
candle
lighted
in
which
was
as
great
a
joy
to
him
as
the
star
that
guides
the
traveller
or
wandering
seaman
or
the
lamp
at
that
guided
the
ravished
lover
over
the
and
by
that
time
he
could
imagine
all
in
bed
he
made
a
little
noise
with
a
key
on
the
pummel
of
his
sword
but
whether
heard
it
or
not
i
can
not
tell
but
she
anon
came
to
the
window
and
putting
up
the
sash
leaned
on
her
arms
and
looked
into
the
garden
oh
who
but
he
himself
that
loved
so
well
as
can
express
the
transports
he
was
in
at
the
sight
which
more
from
the
sight
within
than
that
without
he
saw
was
the
lovely
whom
calling
softly
by
her
name
answered
him
as
if
she
knew
the
welcome
voice
and
cried
who
is
there
she
was
soon
answered
you
may
imagine
and
they
began
the
most
endearing
conversation
that
ever
love
could
dictate
he
complains
on
his
fate
that
sets
them
at
that
distance
and
she
pities
him
he
makes
a
thousand
doubts
and
she
undeceives
them
all
he
fears
and
she
convinces
his
error
and
is
impatient
at
his
suspicions
she
will
not
endure
him
to
question
a
heart
that
has
given
him
so
many
proofs
of
its
tenderness
and
gratitude
she
tells
him
her
own
wishes
how
soft
and
fervent
they
are
and
assures
him
he
is
extremely
obliged
to
her
since
for
you
my
charming
friend
said
she
to
i
have
refused
this
night
to
marry
your
uncle
have
a
care
said
she
smiling
how
you
treat
me
lest
i
revenge
myself
on
you
become
your
aunt
and
bring
heirs
to
the
estate
you
have
a
right
to
the
writings
of
all
which
i
have
now
in
my
chamber
and
which
were
but
just
now
laid
at
my
feet
and
which
i
can
not
yet
get
him
to
receive
back
and
to
oblige
me
to
a
compliance
has
told
me
how
you
have
deceived
me
by
giving
yourself
to
another
and
exposing
me
in
to
this
would
have
replied
but
she
assured
him
she
needed
no
argument
to
convince
her
of
the
falsehood
of
all
he
sighs
and
told
her
all
she
said
though
dear
and
charming
was
not
sufficient
to
ease
his
heart
for
he
foresaw
a
world
of
hazard
to
get
her
from
thence
and
mischiefs
if
she
remained
insomuch
that
he
caused
the
tears
to
flow
from
the
fair
eyes
of
with
her
reflections
on
her
rigid
fortune
and
she
cried
oh
my
what
strange
fate
or
stars
ruled
my
birth
that
i
should
be
born
to
the
ruin
of
what
i
love
or
those
that
love
me
at
this
rate
they
passed
the
night
sometimes
more
soft
sometimes
encouraging
one
another
but
the
last
result
was
to
contrive
the
means
of
escaping
he
fancied
she
might
easily
do
it
by
the
garden
from
the
window
but
that
he
was
not
sure
he
could
trust
the
gardener
so
far
who
in
all
things
would
serve
him
in
which
his
lord
and
master
was
not
injured
and
he
amongst
the
rest
of
the
servants
had
orders
not
to
suffer
out
of
the
garden
for
which
reason
he
kept
a
guard
on
that
some
way
must
be
found
out
which
yet
was
not
and
was
left
to
time
he
told
her
whence
he
was
and
that
he
would
not
stir
from
thence
till
he
was
secured
of
her
flight
and
day
coming
on
though
loath
yet
for
fear
of
eyes
and
ears
that
might
spy
upon
them
he
retired
to
his
little
lodging
and
to
bed
after
giving
and
receiving
a
thousand
vows
and
farewells
the
next
night
he
came
to
the
same
place
but
instead
of
entertaining
her
he
only
saw
her
softly
put
up
the
sash
a
little
and
throw
something
white
out
of
the
window
and
retire
he
was
wondering
at
the
meaning
but
taking
up
what
was
thrown
down
he
found
and
smelt
it
was
handkerchief
in
which
was
tied
up
a
billet
he
went
to
his
little
lodging
and
read
it
sylvia
octavio
go
from
my
window
my
adorable
friend
and
be
not
afflicted
that
i
do
not
entertain
you
as
i
had
the
joy
to
do
last
night
for
both
our
voices
were
heard
by
some
one
that
lodges
below
and
though
your
uncle
could
not
tell
me
any
part
of
our
conversation
yet
he
heard
i
talked
to
some
body
i
have
persuaded
him
the
fellow
dreamed
who
gave
him
this
intelligence
and
he
is
almost
satisfied
he
did
so
however
hazard
not
thy
any
more
so
but
let
me
lose
for
a
while
the
greatest
happiness
this
earth
can
afford
me
in
the
circumstances
of
our
fortunes
rather
than
expose
what
is
dearer
to
me
than
life
or
honour
pity
the
fate
i
was
born
to
and
expect
all
things
from
sylvia
will
wait
at
the
window
for
your
answer
and
let
you
down
a
ribband
by
which
i
will
draw
it
up
but
as
you
love
me
do
not
he
had
no
sooner
read
this
but
he
went
to
write
an
answer
which
was
this
octavio
sylvia
complain
not
thou
goddess
of
my
vows
on
the
fate
thou
wert
born
to
procure
to
all
mankind
but
thank
heaven
for
having
received
ten
thousand
charms
that
can
recompense
all
the
injuries
you
so
unwillingly
do
us
and
who
would
not
implore
his
ruin
from
all
the
angry
powers
if
in
return
they
would
give
him
so
glorious
a
reward
who
would
not
be
undone
to
all
the
trifling
honours
of
the
mistaken
world
to
find
himself
in
lieu
of
all
possessed
of
the
ravishing
but
oh
where
is
that
presumptuous
man
that
can
at
the
price
of
all
lay
claim
to
so
vast
a
blessing
alas
my
even
while
i
dare
call
you
mine
i
am
not
that
hoping
slave
no
not
after
all
the
valued
dear
things
you
have
said
and
vowed
to
me
last
night
in
the
garden
welcome
to
my
soul
as
life
after
a
sentence
of
death
or
heaven
after
life
is
ended
but
oh
all
this
even
all
you
uttered
from
your
dear
mouth
is
not
sufficient
to
support
me
alas
i
die
for
i
am
not
able
to
bear
the
cruel
absence
longer
therefore
without
delay
assist
me
to
contrive
your
escape
or
i
shall
die
and
leave
you
to
the
ravage
of
his
love
who
holds
thee
from
me
the
very
thoughts
of
that
is
worse
than
death
i
die
alas
i
die
for
an
entire
possession
of
thee
oh
let
me
grasp
my
treasure
let
me
engross
it
all
here
in
my
longing
arms
i
can
no
longer
languish
at
this
distance
from
my
cruel
joy
my
life
my
soul
but
oh
i
rave
and
while
i
should
be
speaking
a
thousand
useful
things
i
am
telling
you
my
pain
a
pain
that
you
may
guess
and
confounding
myself
between
those
and
their
remedies
am
able
to
fix
on
nothing
help
me
to
think
oh
my
dear
charming
creature
help
me
to
think
how
i
shall
bear
thee
off
take
your
own
measures
flatter
him
with
love
soothe
him
to
faith
and
confidence
and
then
oh
pardon
me
if
there
be
baseness
in
the
action
then
cozen
him
deceive
him
any
thing
for
he
deserves
it
all
that
thinks
that
lovely
body
was
formed
for
his
embraces
whom
age
has
rendered
fitter
for
a
grave
form
any
plots
use
every
stratagem
to
save
the
life
of
octavio
he
wrote
this
in
haste
and
disorder
as
you
may
plainly
see
by
the
style
and
went
to
the
window
with
it
where
he
found
leaning
expecting
him
the
sashes
were
up
and
he
tossed
it
in
the
handkerchief
into
her
window
she
read
it
and
wrote
an
answer
back
as
soft
as
love
could
form
to
send
him
pleased
to
bed
wherein
she
commanded
him
to
hope
all
things
from
her
wit
and
industrious
love
this
had
partly
the
effects
she
wished
and
after
kissing
his
hand
and
throwing
it
up
towards
they
parted
as
silent
as
the
night
from
day
which
was
now
just
dividing
so
long
they
stayed
though
but
to
look
at
each
other
so
that
all
the
morning
was
passed
in
bed
to
make
the
day
seem
shorter
which
was
too
tedious
to
both
this
pleasure
he
had
after
noon
towards
the
evening
that
when
walked
as
she
always
did
in
the
garden
he
could
see
her
through
the
glass
of
his
window
but
durst
not
open
it
for
the
old
gentleman
was
ever
with
her
in
this
time
failed
not
however
to
essay
the
good
nature
of
the
gardener
in
order
to
flight
but
found
there
was
no
dealing
with
him
in
this
affair
and
therefore
durst
not
come
right
down
to
the
point
the
next
night
he
came
under
the
beloved
window
again
and
found
the
sacred
object
of
his
wishes
leaning
in
the
window
expecting
him
to
whom
as
soon
as
she
heard
his
tread
on
the
gravel
she
threw
down
a
handkerchief
again
which
he
took
up
and
tossed
his
own
with
a
soft
complaining
letter
to
entertain
her
till
his
return
for
he
hasted
to
read
hers
and
swept
the
garden
as
he
passed
as
swift
as
wind
so
impatient
he
was
to
see
the
inside
which
he
found
thus
sylvia
octavio
i
beg
my
charming
friend
you
will
be
assured
of
all
i
have
promised
you
and
to
believe
that
but
for
the
pleasure
of
those
dear
billets
i
receive
from
you
i
could
as
little
support
this
cruel
confinement
as
you
my
absence
i
have
but
one
game
to
play
and
i
beseech
you
not
to
be
surprised
at
it
it
is
to
promise
to
marry
he
is
eternally
at
my
feet
and
either
i
must
give
him
my
vow
to
become
his
wife
or
give
him
hope
of
other
favours
i
am
so
entirely
yours
that
i
will
be
guided
by
you
which
i
shall
flatter
him
in
to
gain
my
liberty
for
if
i
grant
either
he
has
proposed
to
carry
me
to
his
two
leagues
from
the
town
and
there
consummate
whatever
i
design
to
bless
him
with
and
this
is
it
that
has
wrought
my
consent
that
we
being
to
go
alone
only
my
own
servants
you
may
easily
take
me
thence
by
force
upon
the
road
or
after
our
arrival
where
he
will
not
guard
me
perhaps
so
strictly
as
he
does
here
for
that
i
leave
it
to
your
conduct
and
expect
your
answer
to
your
impatient
sylvia
he
immediately
sat
down
and
wrote
this
octavio
sylvia
have
a
care
my
charming
fair
how
you
play
with
vows
and
however
you
are
forced
for
that
religious
end
of
saving
your
honour
to
deceive
the
poor
old
lover
whom
by
heaven
i
pity
yet
rather
let
me
die
than
know
you
can
be
guilty
of
though
made
in
jest
i
am
well
pleased
at
the
glimpse
of
hope
you
give
me
that
i
shall
see
you
at
his
and
doubt
not
but
to
find
a
way
to
secure
you
to
myself
say
any
thing
promise
to
sacrifice
all
to
his
desire
but
oh
do
not
give
away
thy
dear
thy
precious
self
by
vow
to
any
but
the
languishing
octavio
after
he
had
wrote
this
he
hasted
and
throws
it
into
her
window
and
returned
to
bed
without
seeing
her
which
was
no
small
affliction
to
his
soul
he
had
an
ill
night
of
it
and
fancied
a
thousand
tormenting
things
that
the
old
gentleman
might
then
be
with
her
and
if
alone
what
might
he
not
persuade
by
force
of
rich
presents
of
which
his
uncle
was
well
stored
and
so
he
guessed
and
as
he
guessed
it
proved
as
by
his
next
night
s
letter
he
was
informed
that
the
old
lover
no
sooner
saw
retire
but
having
in
mind
to
try
his
fortune
in
some
critical
minute
for
such
a
minute
he
had
heard
there
was
that
favoured
lovers
but
he
goes
to
his
closet
and
taking
out
some
jewels
of
great
value
to
make
himself
the
more
welcome
he
goes
directly
to
chamber
and
entered
just
as
she
had
taken
up
letter
and
clapped
it
in
her
bosom
as
she
heard
some
body
at
the
door
but
was
not
in
a
little
confusion
when
she
saw
who
it
was
which
she
excused
by
telling
him
she
was
surprised
to
find
herself
with
a
man
in
her
chamber
that
there
he
fell
to
pleading
his
cause
of
love
and
offered
her
again
to
settle
his
estate
upon
her
and
implored
she
would
be
his
wife
after
a
thousand
faint
denials
she
told
him
she
could
not
possibly
receive
that
honour
but
if
she
could
she
would
have
looked
upon
it
as
a
great
favour
from
heaven
at
that
he
was
and
looked
as
ghastly
as
if
his
mother
s
ghost
had
frightened
him
and
after
much
debate
love
and
grief
on
his
side
design
and
dissimulation
on
hers
she
gave
him
hopes
that
atoned
for
all
she
had
before
said
insomuch
that
before
they
parted
an
absolute
bargain
was
struck
up
and
he
was
to
settle
part
of
his
estate
upon
her
as
also
that
to
which
he
had
resolved
in
two
days
to
carry
her
in
earnest
of
this
he
presents
her
with
a
necklace
of
pearl
of
good
value
and
other
jewels
which
was
the
best
rhetoric
he
had
yet
spoke
to
her
and
now
she
had
appeared
the
most
complaisant
lady
in
the
world
she
suffers
him
to
talk
wantonly
to
her
nay
even
to
kiss
her
and
rub
his
grizzly
beard
on
her
divine
face
grasp
her
hands
and
touch
her
breast
a
blessing
he
had
never
before
arrived
to
above
the
quality
of
his
own
to
all
which
she
makes
the
best
resistance
she
can
under
the
circumstances
of
one
who
was
to
deceive
well
and
while
she
loathes
she
seems
well
pleased
while
the
gay
jewels
sparkled
in
her
eyes
and
in
her
heart
so
fond
is
youth
of
vanities
and
to
purchase
an
addition
of
beauty
at
any
price
thus
with
her
pretty
flatteries
she
wrought
upon
his
soul
and
smiled
and
looked
him
into
faith
loath
to
depart
she
sends
him
pleased
away
and
having
her
heart
the
more
inclined
to
by
being
persecuted
with
his
uncle
s
love
for
by
comparison
she
finds
the
mighty
difference
she
sets
herself
to
write
him
the
account
of
what
i
have
related
this
night
s
adventure
and
agreement
between
his
uncle
and
herself
she
tells
him
that
for
now
it
was
almost
day
she
had
promised
him
to
go
to
his
she
tells
him
at
what
rate
she
has
purchased
the
blessing
expected
and
lastly
leaves
the
management
of
the
rest
to
him
who
needs
not
to
be
instructed
this
letter
he
received
the
next
night
at
the
old
place
and
with
it
lets
down
a
velvet
which
contained
all
the
jewels
and
things
of
value
she
had
received
of
himself
his
uncle
or
any
other
after
which
he
retired
and
was
pretty
well
at
ease
with
the
imagination
he
should
ere
long
be
made
happy
in
the
possession
of
in
order
to
it
the
next
morning
he
was
early
up
and
dressing
himself
in
a
great
coarse
of
the
gardener
s
putting
up
his
hair
as
well
as
he
could
under
a
country
hat
he
got
on
a
horse
that
suited
his
habit
and
rides
to
the
whither
they
were
to
come
and
which
he
knew
perfectly
well
every
room
of
for
there
our
hero
was
born
he
went
to
a
little
in
the
village
from
whence
he
could
survey
all
the
great
house
and
see
every
body
that
passed
in
and
out
he
remained
fixed
at
the
window
filled
with
a
thousand
agitations
this
he
had
resolved
not
to
set
upon
the
old
man
as
a
thief
or
robber
nor
could
he
find
in
his
heart
or
nature
to
injure
him
though
but
in
a
little
affrighting
him
who
had
given
him
so
many
anxious
hours
and
who
had
been
so
unjust
to
desire
that
blessing
himself
he
would
not
allow
him
and
to
believe
that
virtue
in
himself
which
he
exclaims
against
as
so
great
a
vice
in
his
nephew
nevertheless
he
resolved
to
deceive
him
to
save
his
own
life
and
he
wanted
that
nice
part
of
generosity
as
to
satisfy
a
little
unnecessary
lust
in
an
old
man
to
ruin
the
eternal
content
of
a
young
one
so
nearly
allied
to
his
soul
as
was
his
own
dear
proper
person
while
he
was
thus
considering
he
saw
his
uncle
s
coach
coming
and
with
that
doting
lover
in
it
who
was
that
day
dressed
in
all
the
fopperies
of
youth
and
every
thing
was
young
and
gay
about
him
but
his
person
that
was
winter
itself
disguised
in
artificial
spring
and
he
was
altogether
a
mere
contradiction
but
who
can
guess
the
disorders
and
pantings
of
heart
at
the
sight
and
though
he
had
resolved
before
he
would
not
to
save
his
life
lay
violent
hands
upon
his
old
parent
yet
at
their
approach
at
their
presenting
themselves
together
before
his
eyes
as
two
lovers
going
to
betray
him
to
all
the
miseries
pangs
and
confusions
of
love
going
to
possess
her
the
dear
object
and
certain
life
of
his
soul
and
he
the
parent
of
him
to
whom
she
had
disposed
of
herself
so
entirely
already
he
was
provoked
to
break
from
all
his
resolutions
and
with
one
of
those
pistols
he
had
in
his
pockets
to
have
sent
unerring
death
to
his
old
amorous
heart
but
that
thought
was
no
sooner
born
than
stifled
in
his
soul
where
it
met
with
all
the
sense
of
gratitude
that
ever
could
present
the
tender
love
and
dear
care
of
a
parent
there
and
the
coach
passing
into
the
gate
put
him
upon
new
designs
and
before
they
were
finished
he
saw
page
coming
from
the
house
after
seeing
his
lady
to
her
apartment
and
being
shewed
his
own
where
he
laid
his
valise
and
riding
things
and
was
now
come
out
to
look
about
a
country
where
he
had
never
been
before
goes
down
and
meets
him
and
ventures
to
make
himself
known
to
him
and
so
infinitely
glad
was
the
youth
to
have
an
opportunity
to
serve
him
that
he
vowed
he
would
not
only
do
it
with
his
life
on
occasion
but
believed
he
could
do
it
effectually
since
the
old
gentleman
had
no
sort
of
jealousy
now
especially
since
they
had
so
prudently
managed
matters
in
this
time
of
his
lady
s
remaining
at
house
so
that
sir
it
will
not
be
difficult
says
the
generous
boy
for
me
to
convey
you
to
my
lodging
when
it
is
he
told
him
his
lady
cast
many
a
longing
look
out
towards
the
road
as
she
passed
for
you
i
am
sure
my
lord
for
she
had
told
both
myself
and
of
her
design
before
lest
our
surprise
or
resistance
should
prevent
any
force
you
might
use
on
the
road
to
take
her
from
my
lord
she
sighed
and
looked
on
me
as
she
alighted
with
eyes
my
lord
that
told
me
her
grief
for
your
you
may
easily
imagine
how
transported
the
poor
was
he
kissed
and
embraced
the
amiable
boy
a
thousand
times
and
taking
a
ring
from
his
finger
of
considerable
value
gave
it
the
dear
reviver
of
his
hopes
already
knew
the
strength
of
the
house
which
consisted
but
of
a
gardener
whose
wife
was
and
their
son
who
was
his
father
s
servant
in
the
garden
and
their
daughter
who
was
a
sort
of
and
they
had
brought
only
the
coachman
and
one
footman
who
were
likely
to
be
merrily
employed
in
the
kitchen
at
night
when
all
got
to
supper
together
i
say
already
knew
this
and
there
was
now
nothing
that
opposed
his
wishes
so
that
dismissing
the
dear
boy
he
remained
the
rest
of
the
tedious
day
at
the
the
most
impatient
of
night
of
any
man
on
earth
and
when
the
boy
appeared
it
was
like
the
approach
of
an
angel
he
told
him
his
lady
was
the
most
melancholy
creature
that
ever
eyes
beheld
and
that
to
conceal
the
cause
she
had
feigned
herself
ill
and
had
not
stirred
from
her
chamber
all
the
day
that
the
old
lover
was
perpetually
with
her
and
the
most
concerned
dotard
that
ever
enslaved
that
he
had
so
wholly
taken
up
his
lady
with
his
disagreeable
entertainment
that
it
was
impossible
either
by
a
look
or
note
to
inform
her
of
his
being
so
near
her
whom
she
considered
as
her
present
defender
and
her
future
happiness
but
this
evening
continued
the
youth
as
i
was
waiting
on
her
at
supper
she
spied
the
ring
on
my
finger
which
my
lord
your
bounty
made
me
master
of
this
morning
she
blushed
a
thousand
times
and
fixed
her
eyes
upon
it
for
she
knew
it
and
was
impatient
to
have
asked
me
some
questions
but
contained
her
words
and
after
that
i
saw
a
joy
dance
in
her
lovely
eyes
that
told
me
she
divined
you
were
not
far
from
thence
therefore
i
beseech
your
lordship
let
us
so
both
went
out
together
and
the
page
conducted
him
into
a
chamber
he
better
knew
than
the
boy
while
every
moment
he
receives
intelligence
how
affairs
went
in
that
of
by
the
page
who
leaving
there
went
out
as
a
spy
for
him
in
fine
with
much
ado
persuaded
her
old
lover
to
urge
her
for
no
favours
that
night
for
she
was
indisposed
and
unfit
for
love
yet
she
persuades
with
such
an
air
so
smiling
and
insinuating
that
she
increases
the
fire
she
endeavoured
to
allay
but
he
who
was
all
obedience
as
well
as
new
desire
resolves
to
humour
her
and
shew
the
perfect
gallantry
of
his
love
he
promises
her
she
shall
command
and
after
that
never
was
the
old
gentleman
seen
in
so
excellent
a
humour
before
in
the
whole
course
of
his
life
a
certain
lightning
against
a
storm
that
must
be
fatal
to
him
he
was
no
sooner
gone
from
her
with
a
promise
to
go
to
bed
and
sleep
that
he
might
be
the
earlier
up
to
shew
her
the
fine
gardens
which
she
loved
but
she
sends
to
call
the
page
from
whom
she
longed
to
know
something
of
and
was
sure
he
could
inform
her
but
she
was
undressing
while
she
spoke
and
got
into
her
bed
before
she
left
her
but
instead
of
bringing
the
sighing
youth
brought
the
transported
and
ravished
who
had
by
this
time
pulled
his
coarse
campaign
and
put
down
his
hair
he
fell
breathless
with
joy
on
her
when
who
knew
that
love
desired
no
retired
and
left
almost
dead
with
joy
in
the
clasping
arms
of
the
trembling
maid
the
lovely
oh
who
can
guess
their
satisfaction
who
can
guess
their
sighs
and
love
their
tender
words
half
stifled
in
kisses
lovers
fond
lovers
only
can
imagine
to
all
besides
this
tale
will
be
insipid
he
now
forgets
where
he
is
that
not
far
off
lay
his
amorous
uncle
that
to
be
found
there
was
death
and
something
worse
but
wholly
ravished
with
the
languishing
beauty
taking
his
pistols
out
of
either
pocket
he
lays
them
on
a
near
the
and
in
a
moment
throws
off
his
clothes
and
gives
himself
up
to
all
the
heaven
of
love
that
lay
ready
to
receive
him
there
without
thinking
of
any
thing
but
the
vast
power
of
either
s
charms
they
lay
and
forgot
the
hasty
hours
but
old
did
not
they
were
all
counted
by
him
with
the
impatience
of
a
lover
he
burnt
he
raged
with
fierce
desire
and
tossed
from
side
to
side
and
found
no
ease
was
present
in
imagination
and
he
like
reaches
at
the
food
which
though
in
view
is
not
within
his
reach
he
would
have
prayed
but
he
had
no
devotion
for
any
deity
but
he
rose
and
walked
and
went
to
bed
again
and
found
himself
uneasy
every
way
a
thousand
times
he
was
about
to
go
and
try
what
opportunity
would
do
in
the
dark
silent
night
but
fears
her
rage
he
fears
she
will
chide
at
least
then
he
resolves
and
unresolves
as
fast
unhappy
lover
thus
to
blow
the
fire
when
there
was
no
materials
to
supply
it
at
last
overcome
with
fierce
desire
too
violent
to
be
withstood
or
rather
fate
would
have
it
so
ordained
he
ventures
all
and
steals
to
chamber
believing
when
she
found
him
in
her
arms
she
could
not
be
displeased
or
if
she
were
that
was
the
surest
place
of
reconciliation
so
that
only
putting
his
about
him
he
went
softly
to
her
chamber
for
fear
of
waking
her
the
unthinking
lovers
had
left
open
the
door
so
that
it
was
hardly
put
to
and
the
first
alarm
was
hand
being
seized
which
was
clasping
his
treasure
he
starts
from
the
frighted
arms
of
and
leaping
from
the
bed
would
have
escaped
for
he
knew
too
well
the
touch
of
that
old
hand
but
wholly
surprised
at
so
robust
a
repulse
took
most
unfortunately
a
stronger
hold
and
laying
both
his
hands
roughly
upon
him
with
a
resolution
to
know
who
he
was
for
he
felt
his
hair
and
struggling
at
the
same
minute
to
get
from
him
they
both
fell
against
the
and
threw
down
the
pistols
in
their
fall
one
of
which
going
off
shot
the
unfortunate
old
lover
into
the
head
so
that
he
never
spoke
word
more
at
the
going
off
of
the
pistol
who
had
not
minded
those
laid
on
the
table
cried
out
oh
my
my
dearest
charmer
replied
he
i
am
well
and
feeling
on
the
dead
body
which
he
wondered
had
no
longer
motion
he
felt
blood
flowing
round
it
and
sighing
cried
ah
i
am
undone
my
uncle
oh
my
parent
speak
dear
sir
what
unlucky
accident
has
done
this
fatal
deed
who
was
very
soft
by
nature
was
extremely
surprised
and
frightened
at
the
news
of
a
dead
man
in
her
chamber
so
that
she
was
ready
to
run
mad
with
the
apprehension
of
it
she
raved
and
tore
herself
and
expressed
her
fright
in
cries
and
distraction
so
that
was
compelled
from
one
charitable
grief
to
another
he
goes
to
her
and
comforts
her
and
tells
since
it
is
by
no
design
of
either
of
them
their
innocence
will
be
their
guardian
angel
he
tells
her
all
their
fault
was
love
which
made
him
so
heedlessly
fond
of
joys
with
her
he
stayed
to
reap
those
when
he
should
have
secured
them
by
flight
he
tells
her
this
is
now
no
place
to
stay
in
and
that
he
would
put
on
her
clothes
and
fly
with
her
to
some
secure
part
of
the
world
for
who
said
he
finds
this
poor
unfortunate
here
will
not
charge
his
death
on
me
or
thee
haste
then
my
dearest
maid
haste
haste
and
let
us
fly
so
dressing
her
he
led
her
into
chamber
while
he
went
to
see
which
way
they
could
get
out
so
locking
the
where
the
dead
body
lay
which
by
this
time
was
stiff
and
cold
he
locked
that
also
of
his
uncle
s
chamber
and
calling
the
page
they
all
got
themselves
ready
and
putting
two
horses
in
the
coach
they
unseen
and
unperceived
got
themselves
all
out
the
servants
having
drank
hard
at
their
meeting
in
the
country
last
night
were
all
too
sound
asleep
to
understand
any
thing
of
what
passed
it
being
now
about
the
break
of
day
was
the
coachman
and
the
page
riding
by
the
while
and
were
in
it
they
in
an
hour
s
time
reached
the
town
where
packed
up
all
that
was
carriageable
took
his
own
coach
and
six
horses
left
his
affairs
to
the
management
of
a
kinsman
that
dwelt
with
him
took
bills
to
the
value
of
two
thousand
pounds
and
immediately
left
the
town
after
receiving
some
letters
that
came
last
night
by
the
post
one
of
which
was
from
and
indeed
this
new
grief
upon
soul
made
him
the
most
dejected
and
melancholy
man
in
the
world
insomuch
that
he
who
never
wept
for
any
thing
but
for
love
was
often
found
with
tears
rolling
down
his
cheeks
at
the
remembrance
of
an
accident
so
deplorable
and
of
which
he
and
his
unhappy
passion
was
the
cause
though
innocently
yet
could
not
the
dire
reflection
of
that
nor
the
loss
of
so
tender
a
parent
as
was
lessen
one
spark
of
that
fire
for
whose
unfortunate
flame
had
been
so
fatal
while
they
were
safe
out
of
danger
the
servants
of
admired
when
ten
eleven
and
twelve
o
clock
was
come
they
saw
neither
the
old
lord
nor
any
of
the
new
guests
but
when
the
coachman
missed
his
coach
and
horses
he
was
in
a
greater
maze
and
thought
some
body
had
stolen
them
and
accusing
himself
of
sluggishness
and
debauchery
that
made
him
not
able
to
hear
when
the
coach
went
out
he
forswore
all
drinking
but
when
the
and
he
met
and
discoursed
about
the
lady
and
the
rest
they
concluded
that
the
old
gentleman
and
she
were
agreed
upon
the
matter
and
being
got
to
bed
together
had
quite
forgot
themselves
and
made
a
thousand
roguish
remarks
upon
them
they
believed
the
maid
and
the
page
too
were
as
well
employed
since
they
saw
neither
but
when
dinner
was
ready
she
went
up
to
the
maid
s
chamber
and
found
it
empty
as
also
that
of
the
page
her
heart
then
presaging
something
she
ventures
to
knock
at
her
lord
s
but
finding
it
locked
and
none
answer
they
broke
it
open
and
after
doing
the
same
by
that
of
they
found
the
poor
stretched
on
the
floor
and
shot
in
the
head
the
toilet
pulled
almost
down
and
the
lock
of
the
pistol
hanging
in
the
point
of
the
toilet
entangled
and
the
muzzle
of
it
just
against
the
wound
at
first
when
they
saw
him
they
fancied
might
kill
him
for
either
offering
to
come
to
bed
to
her
in
the
night
or
some
other
malicious
end
but
when
they
saw
how
the
pistol
lay
they
fancied
it
accident
in
the
dark
for
said
the
woman
i
and
my
daughter
have
been
up
ever
since
and
i
am
sure
no
such
thing
happened
then
nor
could
they
since
escape
and
it
being
natural
in
to
cry
loop
schellum
that
is
run
rogue
to
him
that
is
alive
and
who
has
killed
another
and
for
every
man
to
set
a
helping
hand
to
bear
him
out
of
danger
thinking
it
too
much
that
one
is
already
dead
i
say
this
being
the
nature
of
the
people
they
never
pursued
the
murderers
or
fled
persons
but
suffered
to
lie
till
the
coroner
sat
upon
him
who
found
it
or
at
least
thought
it
accident
and
there
was
all
for
that
time
but
this
with
all
the
reasonable
circumstances
did
not
satisfy
the
here
is
one
of
their
high
and
mighties
killed
a
fair
lady
fled
and
upon
inquiry
a
fine
young
fellow
too
the
nephew
all
knew
they
were
rivals
in
this
fair
lady
all
knew
there
were
animosities
between
them
all
knew
was
absconded
some
days
before
so
that
upon
consideration
they
concluded
he
was
murdered
by
compact
and
the
rather
because
they
wished
it
so
in
spite
of
and
because
both
he
and
were
fled
like
guilty
persons
upon
this
they
made
a
seizure
of
both
his
and
his
uncle
s
estate
to
the
use
of
the
thus
the
best
and
most
glorious
man
that
ever
graced
that
part
of
the
world
was
undone
by
love
while
with
sighs
and
tears
would
often
say
that
sure
she
was
born
the
fate
of
all
that
adored
her
and
no
man
ever
thrived
that
had
a
design
upon
her
or
a
pretension
to
her
thus
between
excess
of
grief
and
excess
of
love
which
indeed
lay
veiled
in
the
first
they
arrived
at
where
having
news
of
the
proceedings
of
the
against
him
resolving
rather
to
lose
his
life
than
tamely
to
surrender
his
right
he
went
forth
in
order
to
take
some
care
about
it
and
in
these
extremes
of
a
troubled
mind
he
had
forgot
to
read
letters
but
gave
them
to
to
peruse
till
he
returned
beseeching
and
conjuring
her
by
all
the
charms
of
love
not
to
suffer
herself
to
be
afflicted
but
now
to
consider
she
was
wholly
his
and
she
could
not
and
ought
not
to
rob
him
of
a
sigh
or
tear
for
any
other
man
for
they
had
concluded
to
marry
as
soon
as
should
be
delivered
from
that
part
of
of
which
she
was
possessed
therefore
beholding
her
entirely
his
own
of
whom
he
was
so
fondly
tender
he
could
not
endure
the
wind
should
blow
on
her
and
kiss
her
lovely
face
jealous
of
even
the
air
she
breathed
he
was
ever
putting
her
in
mind
of
whose
and
what
she
was
and
she
ever
giving
him
new
assurances
that
she
was
only
the
last
part
of
his
ill
news
he
concealed
from
her
that
of
the
usage
of
the
he
was
so
entirely
careful
of
her
fame
that
he
had
two
lodgings
one
most
magnificent
for
her
another
for
himself
and
only
visited
her
all
the
day
and
being
now
retired
from
her
she
whose
love
and
curiosity
grew
less
every
day
for
the
false
opened
his
letter
with
a
sigh
of
departed
love
and
read
this
philander
octavio
sure
of
your
friendship
my
dear
i
venture
to
lay
before
you
the
history
of
my
misfortunes
as
well
as
those
of
my
joys
equally
extreme
in
my
last
i
gave
you
an
account
how
triumphing
a
lover
i
was
in
the
possession
of
the
adorable
and
how
very
near
i
was
being
surprised
in
the
fountain
where
i
had
hid
myself
from
the
rage
of
old
and
escaped
wet
and
cold
to
my
lodging
and
though
indeed
i
escaped
it
was
not
without
giving
the
old
husband
a
jealousy
which
put
him
upon
inquiry
after
a
stricter
manner
as
i
heard
the
next
day
from
but
with
as
ill
success
as
the
night
before
notwithstanding
it
appears
by
what
after
happened
that
he
still
retained
his
jealousy
and
that
of
me
from
a
thousand
little
inquiries
i
had
from
time
to
time
made
from
my
being
now
absent
and
most
of
all
from
my
being
as
now
he
fancied
that
vision
which
saw
in
the
garden
all
these
circumstances
wrought
a
thousand
in
his
politic
noddle
and
he
resolves
that
actions
should
be
more
narrowly
watched
this
i
can
only
guess
from
what
ensued
i
am
not
able
to
say
by
what
good
fortune
i
escaped
several
happy
nights
after
the
first
but
it
is
certain
i
did
so
for
the
old
man
carrying
all
things
fair
to
the
lovely
countess
she
thought
herself
secure
in
her
joys
hitherto
as
to
any
discovery
however
i
never
went
on
this
dear
adventure
but
i
was
well
armed
against
any
mishaps
of
poniard
sword
and
pistol
that
garb
of
a
right
had
been
married
above
two
years
before
i
beheld
her
and
had
never
been
with
child
but
it
so
chanced
that
she
conceived
the
very
first
night
of
our
happiness
since
which
time
not
all
her
flatteries
and
charms
could
prevail
for
one
night
with
the
old
count
for
whether
from
her
seeming
fondness
he
imagined
the
cause
or
what
other
reason
he
had
to
withstand
her
desire
and
caresses
i
know
not
but
still
he
found
or
feigned
some
excuses
to
put
her
off
so
that
pleas
and
love
increased
with
her
growing
belly
and
though
almost
every
night
i
had
the
fair
young
charmer
in
bed
with
me
without
the
least
suspicion
on
side
or
else
in
the
arbours
or
on
flowery
banks
in
the
garden
till
i
am
confident
there
was
not
a
walk
a
grove
an
arbour
or
bed
of
sweets
that
was
not
conscious
of
our
stolen
delights
nay
we
grew
so
very
bold
in
love
that
we
often
suffered
the
day
to
break
upon
us
and
still
escaped
his
spies
who
by
either
watching
at
the
wrong
door
or
part
of
the
vast
garden
or
by
sleepiness
or
carelessness
still
let
us
pass
their
view
four
happy
months
thus
blessed
and
thus
secured
we
lived
when
could
no
longer
conceal
her
growing
shame
from
the
jealous
or
she
feared
with
too
much
reason
that
it
was
jealousy
which
made
him
refrain
her
bed
though
he
dissembled
well
all
day
and
one
night
weeping
in
my
bosom
with
all
the
tenderness
of
love
she
said
that
if
i
loved
her
as
she
hoped
i
did
i
should
be
shortly
very
miserable
for
oh
cries
she
i
can
no
longer
hide
this
dear
effect
of
my
stolen
happiness
and
will
no
sooner
perceive
my
condition
but
he
will
use
his
utmost
rigour
against
me
i
know
his
jealous
nature
and
find
i
am
undone
with
that
she
told
me
how
he
had
killed
his
first
wife
for
which
he
was
obliged
to
fly
from
the
court
and
country
of
and
that
she
found
from
all
his
severity
he
was
not
changed
from
his
nature
in
fine
she
said
and
loved
so
much
that
i
was
wholly
charmed
and
vowed
myself
her
slave
or
sacrifice
either
to
follow
what
she
could
propose
or
fall
a
victim
with
her
to
my
love
after
which
it
was
concluded
neither
having
a
mind
to
leave
the
world
when
we
both
knew
so
well
how
to
make
ourselves
happy
in
it
that
the
next
night
i
should
bring
her
a
suit
of
men
s
clothes
and
she
would
in
that
disguise
fly
with
me
to
any
part
of
the
world
for
she
vowed
if
this
unlucky
force
of
flying
had
not
happened
to
her
she
had
not
been
longer
able
to
endure
his
tyranny
and
slavery
but
had
resolved
to
break
her
chain
and
put
herself
upon
any
fortune
so
that
after
the
usual
endearments
on
both
sides
i
left
her
resolved
to
follow
my
fortune
and
she
me
to
sacrifice
all
to
her
repose
that
night
and
all
next
day
she
was
not
idle
but
put
up
all
her
jewels
of
which
she
had
the
richest
of
any
lady
in
all
those
parts
for
in
that
the
old
count
was
and
the
next
night
i
brought
her
a
suit
which
i
had
made
that
day
on
purpose
as
gay
as
could
be
made
in
so
short
a
time
and
scaling
my
wall
well
armed
i
found
her
ready
at
the
door
to
receive
me
and
going
into
an
arbour
by
the
aid
of
a
i
carried
she
dressed
her
in
a
laced
shirt
of
mine
and
this
suit
i
had
brought
her
of
blue
velvet
trimmed
with
rich
loops
and
buttons
of
gold
a
white
hat
and
white
feather
a
fair
peruke
and
scarlet
breeches
the
rest
suitable
and
i
must
confess
to
you
my
dear
that
never
any
thing
appeared
so
ravishing
and
yet
i
have
seen
but
even
she
a
baby
to
this
more
noble
figure
is
tall
and
fashioned
the
most
divinely
the
most
proper
for
that
dress
of
any
of
her
sex
and
i
own
i
never
saw
any
thing
so
beautiful
all
over
from
head
to
foot
and
viewing
her
thus
carrying
my
lanthorn
all
about
her
but
more
especially
her
face
her
wondrous
charming
face
pardon
me
if
i
say
what
does
but
look
like
flattery
i
never
saw
any
thing
more
resembling
my
dear
than
the
lovely
your
very
feature
your
very
smile
and
air
so
that
if
possible
that
increased
my
adoration
and
esteem
for
her
thus
completed
i
armed
her
and
buckled
on
her
sword
and
she
would
needs
have
one
of
my
pistols
too
that
stuck
in
my
belt
and
now
she
appeared
all
lovely
man
it
was
so
late
by
that
time
we
had
done
that
the
moon
which
began
to
shine
very
bright
gave
us
a
thousand
little
fears
and
disposing
her
jewels
all
about
us
safe
we
began
our
adventure
with
a
thousand
dreadful
apprehensions
on
side
and
going
up
the
walk
towards
the
place
where
we
were
to
mount
the
wall
just
at
the
end
of
it
turning
a
corner
we
encountered
two
men
who
were
too
near
us
to
be
prevented
oh
cried
to
me
who
saw
them
first
my
dear
we
are
undone
i
looked
and
saw
them
and
replied
my
charmer
do
not
fear
they
are
but
two
to
two
whoever
they
be
for
love
and
i
shall
be
of
force
enough
to
encounter
no
my
replied
she
briskly
it
is
i
will
be
your
second
in
this
at
this
approaching
them
more
near
for
they
hasted
to
us
nor
could
we
fly
from
them
we
soon
found
by
his
hobbling
that
old
was
one
and
the
other
a
tall
his
nephew
i
clapped
my
hair
under
my
hat
and
both
of
us
making
a
stand
we
resolved
if
they
durst
not
venture
on
us
to
let
them
pass
but
who
was
on
that
side
which
faced
cried
ah
villain
have
i
caught
thee
and
at
the
same
instant
with
a
poniard
stabbed
her
into
the
arm
for
with
a
sudden
turn
she
evaded
it
from
her
heart
to
which
it
was
designed
at
which
repaying
his
compliment
she
shot
off
her
pistol
and
down
he
fell
crying
out
for
a
priest
while
i
at
the
same
time
laid
my
tall
boy
at
his
feet
i
caught
my
dear
in
my
arms
and
hasted
through
the
garden
with
her
and
was
very
hasty
in
mounting
the
ladder
putting
my
fair
second
before
me
without
so
much
as
daring
yet
to
ask
her
if
she
were
wounded
lest
it
should
have
hindered
our
flight
if
i
had
found
her
hurt
nor
knew
i
she
was
so
till
i
felt
her
warm
precious
blood
streaming
on
my
face
as
i
lifted
her
over
the
wall
but
i
soon
conveyed
her
into
my
new
lodgings
yet
not
soon
enough
to
secure
her
from
those
that
pursued
us
for
with
their
bawling
they
alarmed
some
of
the
servants
who
looking
narrowly
for
the
murderers
tracked
us
by
blood
which
they
saw
with
their
flambeaus
from
the
place
where
and
his
nephew
lay
to
the
very
wall
and
thinking
from
our
wounds
we
could
not
escape
far
they
searching
the
houses
found
me
dressing
wound
which
i
kissed
a
thousand
times
but
the
matchless
courage
of
the
fair
the
magnanimity
of
soul
nothing
of
foolish
woman
harboured
there
nothing
but
softest
love
for
whilst
i
was
raving
mad
tearing
my
hair
and
cursing
my
fate
in
vain
she
had
no
concern
but
for
me
no
pain
but
that
of
her
fear
of
being
taken
from
me
and
being
delivered
to
old
whom
i
feared
was
not
dead
nor
could
the
very
seizing
her
daunt
her
spirits
but
with
an
unmatched
fortitude
she
bore
it
all
she
only
wished
she
could
have
escaped
without
bloodshed
we
were
both
led
to
prison
but
none
knew
who
we
were
for
those
that
seized
us
had
by
chance
never
seen
me
and
habit
secured
the
discovery
while
we
both
remained
there
we
had
this
comfort
of
being
well
lodged
together
for
they
did
not
go
about
to
part
us
being
in
for
one
crime
and
all
the
satisfaction
she
had
was
that
she
should
she
hoped
die
concealed
if
she
must
die
for
the
crime
and
that
was
much
a
greater
joy
than
to
think
she
should
be
rendered
back
to
who
in
a
few
days
we
heard
was
upon
his
recovery
this
gave
her
new
fears
but
i
confess
to
you
i
was
not
afflicted
at
it
nor
did
i
think
it
hard
for
me
to
bribe
off
for
the
master
of
the
prison
was
very
civil
and
poor
so
that
with
the
help
of
some
few
of
jewels
he
was
wrought
upon
to
let
her
escape
i
offering
to
remain
and
bear
all
the
brunt
of
the
business
and
to
pay
whatever
he
could
be
fined
for
it
these
reasons
with
the
ready
jewels
mollified
the
needy
rascal
and
though
loath
she
were
to
leave
me
yet
she
being
assured
that
all
they
could
do
was
but
to
fine
me
and
her
stay
she
knew
was
her
inevitable
ruin
at
last
submitted
leaving
me
sufficient
in
jewels
to
satisfy
for
all
that
could
happen
which
were
the
value
of
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
she
is
fled
to
to
a
nunnery
of
where
the
lady
abbess
is
her
aunt
and
where
for
a
little
time
she
is
secure
till
i
can
follow
her
i
beg
of
you
my
dear
write
to
me
and
write
me
a
letter
of
recommendation
to
the
magistrates
here
who
all
being
concerned
when
any
one
of
them
is
a
cuckold
are
very
severe
upon
criminals
in
those
cases
i
tire
you
with
my
melancholy
adventure
but
it
is
some
ease
in
the
extremes
of
grief
to
receive
the
tender
pity
of
a
friend
and
that
i
am
sure
will
afford
his
unhappy
philander
as
cold
and
as
unconcerned
as
imagined
she
had
found
her
heart
to
memory
at
the
reading
of
this
letter
in
spite
of
all
the
tenderness
she
had
for
she
was
possessed
with
all
those
pains
of
love
and
jealousy
which
heretofore
tormented
her
when
love
was
young
and
appeared
with
all
those
charms
with
which
he
first
conquered
she
found
the
fire
was
but
hid
under
those
embers
which
every
little
blast
blows
off
and
makes
it
flame
anew
it
was
now
that
she
forgetting
all
the
past
obligations
of
all
his
vast
presents
his
vows
his
sufferings
his
passion
and
his
youth
abandoned
herself
wholly
to
her
tenderness
for
and
drowns
her
fair
cheeks
in
a
shower
of
tears
and
having
eased
her
heart
a
little
by
this
natural
relief
of
her
sex
she
opened
the
letter
that
was
designed
for
herself
and
read
this
sylvia
i
know
my
lovely
i
am
accused
of
a
thousand
barbarities
for
unkindly
detaining
your
lover
who
long
ere
this
ought
to
have
thrown
himself
at
your
feet
imploring
a
thousand
pardons
for
his
tedious
six
months
absence
though
the
affliction
of
it
is
all
my
own
and
i
am
afraid
all
the
punishment
but
when
my
dearest
i
reflect
again
it
is
in
order
to
our
future
tranquillity
i
depend
on
your
love
and
reason
for
my
excuse
i
know
my
absence
has
procured
me
a
thousand
rivals
and
you
as
many
adorers
and
fear
appears
grown
old
in
love
and
worn
out
with
sorrow
and
care
unfit
for
the
soft
play
of
the
young
and
delicate
new
lovers
have
new
vows
and
new
presents
and
your
fickle
sex
stoop
to
the
lavish
prostrate
ill
luck
unkind
fate
has
rifled
me
and
of
a
shining
fortune
left
me
even
to
the
charity
of
a
stingy
world
and
i
have
now
no
compliment
to
maintain
the
esteem
in
so
great
a
soul
as
that
of
but
that
old
repeated
one
of
telling
her
my
dull
my
trifling
heart
is
still
her
own
but
oh
i
want
the
presenting
eloquence
that
so
persuades
and
charms
the
fair
and
am
reduced
to
that
fatal
torment
of
a
generous
mind
rather
to
ask
and
take
than
to
bestow
yet
out
of
my
contemptible
stock
i
have
sent
my
something
towards
that
dangerous
unavoidable
hour
which
will
declare
me
however
a
happy
father
of
what
my
bears
about
her
it
is
a
bill
for
a
thousand
pattacoons
i
am
at
present
under
an
easy
restraint
about
a
little
dispute
between
a
man
of
quality
here
and
myself
i
had
also
been
at
to
have
provided
all
things
for
your
coming
illness
but
every
day
expect
my
liberty
and
then
without
delay
i
will
take
post
and
bring
to
your
arms
i
have
news
that
is
arrived
at
i
am
at
present
a
stranger
to
all
that
passes
and
having
a
double
obligation
to
haste
you
need
not
fear
but
i
shall
do
so
this
letter
raised
in
her
a
different
sentiment
from
that
of
the
story
of
his
misfortune
and
that
taught
her
to
know
that
this
he
had
writ
to
her
was
all
false
and
dissembled
which
made
her
in
concluding
the
letter
cry
out
with
a
vehement
scorn
and
oh
how
i
hate
thee
traitor
who
hast
the
impudence
to
continue
thus
to
impose
upon
me
as
if
i
wanted
common
sense
to
see
thy
baseness
for
what
can
be
more
base
and
cowardly
than
lies
that
poor
plebeian
shift
condemned
by
men
of
honour
or
of
thus
she
spoke
without
reminding
that
this
most
contemptible
quality
she
herself
was
equally
guilty
of
though
infinitely
more
excusable
in
her
sex
there
being
a
thousand
little
actions
of
their
lives
liable
to
censure
and
reproach
which
they
would
willingly
excuse
and
colour
over
with
little
falsities
but
in
a
man
whose
most
inconstant
actions
pass
oftentimes
for
innocent
gallantries
and
to
whom
it
is
no
infamy
to
own
a
thousand
amours
but
rather
a
glory
to
his
fame
and
merit
i
say
in
him
whom
custom
has
favoured
with
an
allowance
to
commit
any
vices
and
boast
it
it
is
not
so
brave
and
this
fault
of
cured
of
her
disease
of
love
and
chased
from
her
heart
all
that
softness
which
once
had
so
much
favoured
him
nevertheless
she
was
filled
with
thoughts
that
failed
not
to
make
her
extremely
melancholy
and
it
was
in
this
humour
found
her
who
forgetting
all
his
own
griefs
to
lessen
hers
for
his
love
was
arrived
to
a
degree
of
madness
he
caresses
her
with
all
the
eloquence
his
passion
could
pour
out
he
falls
at
her
feet
and
pleads
with
such
a
look
and
voice
as
could
not
be
resisted
nor
ceased
he
till
he
had
talked
her
into
ease
till
he
had
looked
and
loved
her
into
a
perfect
calm
it
was
then
he
urged
her
to
a
new
confirmation
of
her
heart
to
him
and
took
hold
of
every
yielding
softness
in
her
to
improve
his
advantage
he
pressed
her
to
all
he
wished
but
by
such
tender
degrees
by
arts
so
fond
and
endearing
that
she
could
deny
nothing
in
this
humour
she
makes
a
thousand
vows
against
to
hate
him
as
a
man
that
had
first
ruined
her
honour
and
then
abandoned
her
to
all
the
ills
that
attend
ungovern
d
youth
and
unguarded
beauty
she
makes
swear
as
often
to
be
revenged
on
him
for
the
dishonour
of
his
sister
which
being
performed
they
all
the
satisfaction
which
had
seemed
almost
destroyed
by
adverse
fate
and
for
a
little
space
lived
in
great
tranquillity
or
if
had
sentiments
that
represented
past
unhappinesses
and
a
future
prospect
of
ill
consequences
he
strove
with
all
the
power
of
love
to
hide
them
from
in
this
time
they
often
sent
to
the
nunnery
of
the
to
inquire
of
the
countess
of
and
at
last
hearing
she
was
arrived
no
force
of
persuasion
or
reason
could
hinder
from
going
to
make
her
a
visit
pleads
in
vain
the
overthrow
of
all
his
revenge
by
his
sister
s
knowledge
that
her
intrigue
was
found
out
but
in
an
undress
for
her
condition
permitted
no
other
she
is
carried
to
the
monastery
and
asks
for
the
mother
prioress
who
came
to
the
grate
where
after
the
first
compliments
over
she
tells
her
she
is
a
relation
to
that
lady
who
such
a
day
came
to
the
house
by
her
habit
and
equipage
appearing
of
quality
was
answered
that
though
the
lady
were
very
much
indisposed
and
unfit
to
appear
at
the
grate
she
would
nevertheless
endeavour
to
serve
her
since
she
was
so
earnest
and
commanding
one
of
the
nuns
to
call
down
madam
the
countess
she
immediately
came
but
though
in
a
dress
all
negligent
and
a
face
where
languishment
appeared
she
at
first
sight
surprised
our
fair
one
with
a
certain
majesty
in
her
mien
and
motion
and
an
air
of
greatness
in
her
face
which
resembled
that
of
so
that
not
being
able
to
sustain
herself
on
her
trembling
supporters
she
was
ready
to
faint
at
a
sight
so
charming
and
a
form
so
angelic
she
saw
her
all
that
had
described
nor
could
the
partiality
of
his
passion
render
her
more
lovely
than
she
appeared
this
instant
to
she
came
to
reproach
her
but
she
found
a
majesty
in
her
looks
above
all
censure
that
awed
the
jealous
upbraider
and
almost
put
her
out
of
countenance
and
with
a
rising
blush
she
seemed
ashamed
of
her
errand
at
this
silence
the
lovely
a
little
surprised
demanded
of
an
attending
nun
if
that
lady
would
speak
with
her
this
awaked
into
an
address
and
she
replied
yes
madam
i
am
the
unfortunate
who
am
compelled
by
my
hard
fate
to
complain
of
the
most
charming
woman
that
ever
nature
made
i
thought
in
my
coming
hither
i
should
have
had
no
other
business
but
to
have
told
you
how
false
how
perjured
a
lover
i
had
had
but
at
a
sight
so
wondrous
i
blame
him
no
more
whom
i
find
now
compelled
to
love
but
you
who
have
taken
from
me
by
your
charms
the
only
blessing
heaven
had
lent
this
she
ended
with
a
sigh
and
madam
the
countess
who
from
the
beginning
of
her
speaking
guessed
from
a
certain
trembling
at
her
heart
who
it
was
she
spoke
of
resolved
to
shew
no
signs
of
a
womanish
fear
or
jealousy
but
with
an
unalterable
air
and
courage
replied
madam
if
my
charms
were
so
powerful
as
you
are
pleased
to
tell
me
they
are
they
sure
have
attracted
too
many
lovers
for
me
to
understand
which
it
is
i
have
been
so
unhappy
to
rob
you
of
if
he
be
a
gallant
man
i
shall
neither
deny
him
nor
repent
my
loving
him
the
more
for
his
having
been
a
lover
to
which
who
expected
not
so
brisk
an
answer
replied
she
makes
such
a
confession
with
so
much
generosity
i
know
she
can
not
be
insensible
of
the
injuries
she
does
but
will
have
a
consideration
and
pity
for
those
wretches
at
least
who
are
undone
to
establish
her
replied
the
countess
a
little
touched
with
the
tenderness
and
sadness
with
which
she
spoke
you
have
so
just
a
character
of
my
soul
that
i
assure
you
i
would
not
for
any
pleasure
in
the
world
do
an
action
should
render
it
less
worthy
of
your
good
thoughts
name
me
the
man
and
if
i
find
him
such
as
i
may
return
you
with
honour
he
shall
find
my
friendship
no
ah
madam
it
is
impossible
cried
he
can
ever
be
mine
that
has
once
had
the
glory
of
being
conquered
by
you
and
what
is
yet
more
of
having
conquered
nay
madam
replied
if
your
loss
be
irrecoverable
i
have
no
more
to
do
but
to
sigh
with
you
and
join
our
hard
fates
but
i
am
not
so
vain
of
my
own
beauty
nor
have
so
little
admiration
for
that
of
yours
to
imagine
i
can
retain
any
thing
you
have
a
claim
to
for
me
i
am
not
fond
of
admirers
if
heaven
be
pleased
to
give
me
one
i
ask
no
more
i
will
leave
the
world
to
you
so
it
allow
me
my
this
she
spoke
with
a
little
malice
which
called
up
all
the
blushes
in
the
fair
face
of
who
a
little
nettled
at
the
word
replied
go
take
the
perjured
man
and
see
how
long
you
can
maintain
your
empire
over
his
fickle
heart
who
has
already
betrayed
you
to
all
the
reproach
an
incensed
rival
and
an
injured
brother
can
load
you
with
see
where
he
has
exposed
you
to
and
after
that
tell
me
what
you
can
hope
from
such
a
perjured
villain
at
these
words
she
gave
her
the
letter
had
writ
to
with
that
he
had
writ
to
herself
and
without
taking
leave
or
speaking
any
more
she
left
her
thoughtful
rival
who
after
pausing
a
moment
on
what
should
be
writ
there
and
what
the
angry
lady
meant
she
silently
passed
on
to
her
chamber
but
if
she
were
surprised
with
her
visitor
she
was
much
more
when
opening
the
letters
she
found
one
to
her
brother
filled
with
the
history
of
her
infamy
and
what
pressed
her
soul
more
sensibly
the
other
filled
with
passion
and
softness
to
a
mistress
she
had
scarcely
read
them
out
but
a
young
nun
her
kinswoman
came
into
her
chamber
whom
i
have
since
heard
protest
she
scarce
saw
in
that
moment
any
alteration
in
her
but
that
she
rose
and
received
her
with
her
wonted
grace
and
sweetness
and
but
for
some
answers
that
she
made
à
and
sighs
that
against
her
will
broke
from
her
heart
she
should
not
have
found
an
alteration
but
this
being
unusual
made
her
inquisitive
and
the
faint
denial
she
met
with
made
her
importune
and
that
so
earnestly
and
with
so
many
vows
of
fidelity
and
secrecy
that
heart
even
breaking
within
poured
itself
for
ease
into
the
faithful
bosom
of
this
young
devotee
and
having
told
her
all
the
story
of
her
misfortune
she
began
with
so
much
courage
and
bravery
of
mind
to
make
vows
against
the
charming
betrayer
of
her
fame
and
with
him
all
mankind
and
this
with
such
consideration
and
repentance
as
left
no
room
for
reproach
or
persuasion
and
from
this
moment
resolved
never
to
quit
the
solitude
of
the
cloisters
she
had
all
her
life
before
her
marriage
lived
in
one
and
wished
now
she
had
never
seen
the
world
or
departed
from
a
life
so
pure
and
innocent
she
looked
upon
this
fatal
accident
now
a
blessing
to
bring
her
back
to
a
life
of
devotion
and
tranquillity
and
indeed
is
a
miracle
of
piety
some
time
after
this
she
was
brought
to
bed
but
commanded
the
child
should
be
removed
where
she
might
never
see
it
which
accordingly
was
done
after
which
in
due
time
she
took
the
habit
and
remains
a
rare
example
of
repentance
and
this
new
penitent
became
the
news
of
the
whole
town
and
it
was
not
without
some
pleasure
that
heard
it
as
the
only
action
she
could
do
that
could
reconcile
him
to
her
the
knowledge
of
which
and
some
few
soft
days
with
made
him
chase
away
all
those
shiverings
that
had
seized
him
upon
several
occasions
but
was
all
sweetness
all
love
and
good
humour
and
made
his
days
easy
and
his
nights
entirely
happy
while
on
the
other
side
there
was
no
satisfaction
no
pleasure
that
the
fond
lavish
lover
did
not
at
any
price
purchase
for
her
repose
for
it
was
the
whole
business
of
his
life
to
study
what
would
charm
and
please
her
and
being
assured
by
so
many
vows
of
her
heart
there
was
nothing
rested
to
make
him
perfectly
happy
but
her
being
delivered
of
what
belonged
to
his
rival
and
in
which
he
had
no
part
he
was
at
perfect
ease
this
she
wishes
with
an
impatience
equal
to
his
whose
love
and
fondness
for
appeared
to
be
arrived
to
the
highest
degree
and
she
every
minute
expected
to
be
free
from
the
only
thing
that
hindered
her
from
giving
herself
entirely
to
her
impatient
love
in
the
midst
of
this
serenity
of
affairs
page
one
day
brings
them
news
his
lord
was
arrived
and
that
he
saw
him
in
the
park
walking
with
some
gentlemen
and
undiscovered
to
him
came
to
give
her
notice
that
she
might
take
her
measures
accordingly
in
spite
of
all
her
love
to
her
blushes
flew
to
her
cheeks
at
the
news
and
her
heart
panted
with
unusual
motion
she
wonders
at
herself
and
fears
and
doubts
her
own
resolution
she
till
now
believed
him
wholly
indifferent
to
her
but
she
knows
not
what
construction
this
new
disorder
will
bear
and
what
confounded
and
perplexed
her
more
was
that
beheld
all
these
emotions
with
unconceivable
resentment
he
swells
with
pride
and
anger
and
even
bursts
with
grief
and
not
able
longer
to
contain
his
complaint
he
reproaches
her
in
the
softest
language
that
ever
love
and
grief
invented
while
she
weeps
with
shame
and
divided
love
and
demands
of
him
a
thousand
pardons
she
deals
thus
kindly
at
least
with
him
to
confess
this
truth
that
it
was
impossible
but
at
the
approach
of
a
man
who
taught
her
first
to
love
and
for
which
knowledge
she
had
paid
so
infinitely
dear
she
could
not
but
feel
unusual
motions
that
that
tenderness
and
infant
flame
he
once
inspired
could
not
but
have
left
some
warmth
about
her
heart
and
that
the
once
charming
dear
could
never
be
absolutely
to
her
as
a
common
man
and
begged
that
he
would
give
some
grains
of
allowance
to
a
maid
so
soft
by
nature
and
who
had
once
loved
so
well
to
be
undone
by
the
dear
object
and
though
every
kind
word
she
gave
his
rival
was
a
dagger
at
his
heart
nevertheless
he
found
or
would
think
he
found
some
reason
in
what
she
said
at
least
he
seemed
more
appeased
while
she
on
the
other
side
dissembled
all
the
ease
and
repose
of
mind
that
could
flatter
him
to
calmness
you
must
know
that
for
honour
she
had
lodgings
by
herself
and
had
his
in
another
house
at
an
aunt
s
of
his
a
widow
and
a
woman
of
great
quality
and
being
near
her
had
provided
all
things
with
the
greatest
magnificence
imaginable
and
passed
for
a
young
widow
whose
husband
died
at
the
siege
of
only
visited
her
daily
and
all
the
nights
she
had
to
herself
for
he
treated
her
as
one
whom
he
designed
to
make
his
wife
and
one
whose
honour
was
his
own
but
that
night
the
news
of
arrival
was
told
her
she
was
more
than
ordinary
impatient
to
have
him
gone
pretending
illness
and
yet
seemed
loath
to
let
him
go
and
lovers
the
greatest
cullies
in
nature
and
the
aptest
to
be
deceived
though
the
most
do
the
soonest
believe
and
finding
it
the
more
necessary
he
should
depart
the
more
ill
she
feigned
to
be
he
took
his
leave
and
left
her
to
repose
after
taking
all
care
necessary
for
one
in
her
circumstances
but
she
to
make
his
absence
more
sure
and
fearing
lest
he
should
suspect
something
of
her
design
being
herself
guilty
she
orders
him
to
be
called
back
and
caresses
him
anew
tells
him
she
was
never
more
unwilling
to
part
with
him
and
all
the
while
is
complaining
and
wishing
to
be
in
bed
and
says
he
must
not
stir
till
he
sees
her
laid
this
obliges
and
cajoles
him
anew
and
he
will
not
suffer
her
women
to
undress
her
but
does
the
grateful
business
himself
and
reaps
some
dear
recompense
by
every
service
and
pleases
his
eyes
and
lips
with
the
ravishing
beauties
of
the
loose
unguarded
suffering
fair
one
she
permits
him
any
thing
to
have
him
gone
which
was
not
till
he
saw
her
laid
as
if
to
her
rest
but
he
was
no
sooner
got
into
his
coach
but
she
rose
and
slipped
on
her
and
some
other
loose
thingss
and
got
into
a
chair
commanding
her
page
to
conduct
the
chairmen
to
all
the
great
where
she
believed
it
most
likely
to
find
which
was
accordingly
done
and
the
page
entering
inquires
for
such
a
describing
his
person
his
fine
remarkable
black
hair
of
his
own
but
the
first
he
entered
into
he
saw
bespeaking
supper
for
you
must
know
that
that
being
left
as
i
have
said
in
prison
in
for
the
accusation
of
the
unhappy
young
nobleman
was
no
sooner
fled
upon
the
unlucky
death
of
his
uncle
but
the
set
at
liberty
who
took
his
journey
immediately
to
whom
he
found
just
released
from
his
troublesome
affair
and
designed
for
where
they
arrived
that
very
morning
where
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
go
to
the
nunnery
of
st
to
inquire
for
the
fair
but
instead
of
encountering
the
kind
the
impatient
the
brave
he
was
addressed
to
by
the
old
lady
abbess
in
so
rough
a
manner
that
he
no
longer
doubted
upon
what
terms
he
stood
there
though
he
wondered
how
they
should
know
his
story
with
when
to
put
him
out
of
doubt
she
assured
him
he
should
never
more
behold
the
face
of
her
injured
niece
for
whose
revenge
she
left
him
to
heaven
it
was
in
vain
he
kneeled
and
implored
he
was
confirmed
again
and
again
she
should
never
come
from
out
the
confines
of
those
walls
and
that
her
whole
remaining
life
spent
in
penitence
was
too
little
to
wash
away
her
sins
with
him
and
giving
him
the
letter
he
sent
to
which
had
given
and
she
the
lady
abbess
with
a
full
confession
of
her
fault
she
cried
see
there
sir
the
treachery
you
have
committed
against
a
woman
of
quality
whom
your
criminal
love
has
rendered
the
most
miserable
of
her
at
the
ending
of
which
she
drew
the
curtain
over
the
grate
and
left
him
wholly
amazed
and
confounded
finding
it
to
be
the
same
he
had
writ
to
and
in
it
that
he
had
writ
to
by
the
sight
of
which
he
no
longer
doubted
but
that
confidante
had
betrayed
him
every
way
he
rails
on
his
false
friendship
curses
the
lady
abbess
himself
his
fortune
and
his
birth
but
finds
it
all
in
vain
nor
was
he
so
infinitely
afflicted
with
the
thought
of
the
eternal
loss
of
because
he
had
possessed
her
as
he
was
to
find
himself
betrayed
to
her
and
doubtless
to
by
and
nothing
but
being
confined
from
him
though
she
were
very
dear
and
charming
to
his
thought
could
have
made
him
rave
so
extremely
for
a
sight
of
her
he
loves
her
the
more
by
how
much
the
more
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
see
her
and
that
difficulty
and
his
despair
increased
his
flame
in
this
humour
he
went
to
his
lodging
the
most
undone
extravagant
that
ever
raged
with
love
he
considers
her
in
a
place
where
no
art
or
force
of
love
or
human
wit
can
retrieve
her
no
nor
so
much
as
send
her
a
letter
this
added
to
his
fury
and
in
his
first
wild
imaginations
he
resolves
nothing
less
than
firing
the
monastery
that
in
that
confusion
he
might
seize
his
right
of
love
and
do
a
deed
that
would
render
his
name
famous
as
the
youth
who
to
get
a
fame
though
an
inglorious
one
fired
the
temple
of
their
gods
but
his
rage
abating
by
consideration
that
impiety
dwelt
not
long
with
him
and
he
ran
over
a
number
more
till
from
one
to
another
he
reduced
himself
to
a
degree
of
moderation
which
presenting
him
with
some
flattering
hope
that
give
him
a
little
ease
it
was
then
that
and
another
gentleman
of
faction
who
were
newly
arrived
at
came
to
pay
him
their
respects
and
after
a
while
carried
him
into
the
park
to
walk
where
page
had
seen
him
and
from
whence
they
sent
to
bespeak
supper
at
this
where
chair
and
herself
waited
and
where
the
page
found
of
whom
he
asked
for
his
lord
but
understanding
he
could
not
possibly
come
in
some
hours
being
designed
for
court
that
evening
whither
he
was
obliged
to
go
and
kiss
the
governor
s
hands
he
went
to
the
lady
who
was
almost
dead
with
impatience
and
told
her
what
he
had
learned
upon
which
she
ordered
her
chairmen
to
carry
her
back
to
her
lodgings
for
she
would
not
be
persuaded
to
ask
any
questions
of
for
whom
she
had
a
mortal
hate
however
she
resolved
to
send
her
page
back
with
a
billet
to
wait
coming
which
was
not
long
for
having
sooner
dispatched
their
compliment
at
court
than
they
believed
they
should
they
went
all
to
supper
together
where
had
bespoke
it
where
being
impatient
to
learn
all
the
adventures
of
since
his
departure
from
him
and
of
which
no
person
could
give
so
good
an
account
as
gave
order
that
no
body
whomsoever
should
disturb
them
and
sat
himself
down
to
listen
to
the
fortune
of
the
prince
know
my
lord
said
state
of
things
at
your
departure
and
that
all
our
glorious
designs
for
the
liberty
of
all
were
discovered
and
betrayed
by
some
of
those
little
rascals
that
great
men
are
obliged
to
make
use
of
in
the
greatest
designs
upon
whose
confession
you
were
proscribed
myself
this
gentleman
and
several
others
it
was
our
good
fortunes
to
escape
untaken
and
yours
to
fall
first
in
the
messenger
s
hands
and
carried
to
the
even
from
whence
you
had
the
luck
to
escape
but
it
was
not
so
with
heavens
cried
the
prince
i
hope
is
not
not
so
neither
replied
nor
should
you
wonder
you
have
received
no
news
of
him
in
a
long
time
since
forty
thousand
crowns
being
offered
for
his
head
or
to
any
thing
that
could
discover
him
it
would
have
exposed
him
to
have
written
to
any
body
he
being
beset
on
all
sides
with
spies
from
the
king
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
venture
a
letter
without
very
great
hazard
of
his
life
besides
all
these
hindrances
who
you
know
was
ever
a
great
admirer
of
the
fair
sex
happened
in
this
his
retreat
to
fall
most
desperately
in
love
nor
could
the
fears
of
death
which
alarmed
him
on
all
sides
deter
him
from
his
new
amour
which
because
it
has
relation
to
some
part
of
his
adventures
i
can
not
omit
especially
to
your
lordship
his
friend
to
whom
every
circumstance
of
that
prince
s
fate
and
fortune
will
be
of
concern
must
imagine
my
lord
that
your
seizure
and
escape
was
enough
to
alarm
the
whole
party
and
there
was
not
a
man
of
the
league
who
did
not
think
it
high
time
to
look
about
him
when
one
so
considerable
as
your
lordship
was
surprised
nor
did
the
prince
himself
any
longer
believe
himself
safe
but
retired
himself
under
the
darkness
of
the
following
night
he
went
only
accompanied
with
his
page
to
a
lady
s
house
a
widow
of
quality
at
that
populous
city
being
as
he
conceived
the
securest
place
to
conceal
himself
in
this
lady
was
madam
the
countess
of
who
had
as
you
know
my
lord
one
only
daughter
the
heiress
of
her
family
the
prince
knew
this
young
lady
had
a
tenderness
for
him
ever
since
they
were
both
very
young
which
first
took
beginning
in
a
masque
at
court
where
she
then
acted
and
danced
so
exceedingly
finely
that
she
gave
our
young
hero
new
desire
if
not
absolute
love
and
charmed
him
at
least
into
wishes
she
was
not
then
old
enough
to
perceive
she
conquered
as
well
as
to
make
a
conquest
and
she
was
capable
of
receiving
impressions
as
well
as
to
give
them
and
it
was
believed
by
some
who
were
very
near
the
prince
and
knew
all
his
secrets
then
that
this
young
lady
pitied
the
sighs
of
the
royal
lover
and
even
then
rewarded
them
and
though
this
were
most
credibly
whispered
yet
methinks
it
seems
impossible
he
should
then
have
been
happy
and
after
so
many
years
after
the
possession
of
so
many
other
beauties
should
return
to
her
again
and
find
all
the
passions
and
pains
of
a
beginning
flame
but
there
is
nothing
to
be
wondered
at
in
the
contradictions
and
humours
of
human
nature
but
however
inconstant
and
wavering
he
had
been
retained
her
first
passion
for
him
and
that
i
less
wonder
at
since
you
know
the
prince
has
the
most
charming
person
in
the
world
and
is
the
most
perfectly
beautiful
of
all
his
sex
to
this
his
youth
and
quality
add
no
little
lustre
and
i
should
not
wonder
if
all
the
softer
sex
should
languish
for
him
nor
that
any
one
should
love
on
who
hath
once
been
touched
with
love
for
him
was
his
last
assurance
the
prince
so
absolutely
depended
on
that
notwithstanding
she
was
far
from
the
opinion
of
his
party
made
him
resolve
to
take
sanctuary
in
those
arms
he
was
sure
would
receive
him
in
any
condition
and
circumstances
but
now
he
makes
her
new
vows
which
possibly
at
first
his
safety
obliged
him
to
while
she
returned
them
with
all
the
passion
of
love
he
made
a
thousand
submissions
to
madam
the
countess
who
he
knew
was
fond
of
her
daughter
to
that
degree
that
for
her
repose
she
was
even
willing
to
behold
the
sacrifice
of
her
honour
to
this
prince
whom
she
knew
loved
even
to
death
so
fond
so
blindly
fond
is
nature
and
indeed
after
a
little
time
that
he
lay
there
concealed
he
reaped
all
the
satisfaction
that
love
could
give
him
or
his
youth
could
wish
with
all
the
freedom
imaginable
he
only
made
vows
of
renouncing
all
other
women
what
ties
or
obligations
soever
he
had
upon
him
and
to
resign
himself
entirely
up
to
i
know
not
what
new
charms
he
had
found
by
frequent
conversation
with
her
and
being
uninterrupted
by
the
sight
of
any
other
ladies
but
it
is
most
certain
my
lord
that
he
grew
to
that
excess
of
love
or
rather
dotage
if
love
in
one
so
young
can
be
called
so
that
he
languished
for
her
even
while
he
possessed
her
all
he
died
if
obliged
by
company
to
retire
from
her
an
hour
at
the
end
of
which
being
again
brought
to
her
he
would
fall
at
her
feet
and
sigh
and
weep
and
make
the
most
piteous
moan
that
ever
love
inspired
he
would
complain
upon
the
cruelty
of
a
moment
s
absence
and
vow
he
would
not
live
where
she
was
not
all
that
disturbed
his
happiness
he
reproached
as
enemies
to
his
repose
and
at
last
made
her
feign
an
illness
that
no
visits
might
be
made
her
and
that
he
might
possess
all
her
hours
nor
did
perceive
all
this
without
making
her
advantages
of
so
glorious
an
opportunity
but
with
the
usual
cunning
of
her
sex
improved
every
minute
she
gave
him
she
now
found
herself
sure
of
the
heart
of
the
finest
man
in
the
world
and
of
one
she
believed
would
prove
the
greatest
being
the
head
of
a
most
powerful
faction
who
were
resolved
the
first
opportunity
to
order
affairs
so
as
to
come
to
an
open
rebellion
and
to
make
him
a
king
all
these
things
how
unlikely
soever
in
reason
her
love
and
ambition
suggested
to
her
so
that
she
believed
she
had
but
one
game
more
to
play
to
establish
herself
the
greatest
and
most
happy
woman
in
the
world
she
consults
in
this
weighty
affair
with
her
mother
who
had
a
share
of
cunning
that
could
carry
on
a
design
as
well
as
any
of
her
sex
they
found
but
one
obstacle
to
all
rising
greatness
and
that
was
the
prince
s
being
married
and
that
to
a
lady
of
so
considerable
birth
and
fortune
so
eminent
for
her
virtue
and
all
perfections
of
womankind
and
withal
so
excellent
for
wit
and
beauty
that
it
was
impossible
to
find
any
cause
of
a
separation
between
them
so
that
finding
it
improbable
to
remove
that
let
to
her
glories
she
grew
very
melancholy
which
was
soon
perceived
by
the
too
amorous
prince
who
pleads
and
sighs
and
weeps
on
her
bosom
day
and
night
to
find
the
cause
but
she
who
found
she
had
a
difficult
game
to
play
and
that
she
had
need
of
all
her
little
aids
pretends
a
thousand
little
frivolous
reasons
before
she
discovers
the
true
one
which
served
but
to
oblige
him
to
ask
anew
as
she
designed
he
should
at
last
one
morning
finding
him
in
the
softest
fit
in
the
world
and
ready
to
give
her
whatever
she
could
ask
in
return
for
the
secret
of
her
disquiet
she
told
him
with
a
sigh
how
unhappy
she
was
in
loving
so
violently
a
man
who
could
never
be
any
thing
to
her
more
than
the
robber
of
her
honour
and
at
last
with
abundance
of
sighs
and
tears
bewailed
his
marriage
he
taking
her
with
all
the
joy
imaginable
in
his
arms
thanked
her
for
speaking
of
the
only
thing
he
had
a
thousand
times
been
going
to
offer
to
her
but
durst
not
for
fear
she
should
reproach
him
he
told
her
he
looked
upon
himself
as
married
to
no
woman
but
herself
to
whom
by
a
thousand
solemn
vows
he
had
contracted
himself
and
that
he
would
never
own
any
other
while
he
lived
let
fortune
do
what
she
pleased
with
him
thriving
hitherto
so
well
urged
his
easy
heart
yet
farther
and
told
him
though
she
had
left
no
doubt
remaining
in
her
of
his
love
and
virtue
no
suspicion
of
his
vows
yet
the
world
would
still
esteem
the
princess
his
wife
and
herself
only
as
a
prostitute
to
his
youthful
pleasure
and
as
she
conceived
her
birth
and
fortune
not
to
be
much
inferior
to
that
of
the
princess
she
should
die
with
indignation
and
shame
to
bear
all
the
reproach
of
his
wantonness
while
his
now
wife
would
live
esteemed
and
pitied
as
an
injured
innocent
to
all
which
he
replied
as
mad
in
love
that
the
princess
he
confessed
was
a
lady
to
whom
he
had
obligations
but
that
he
esteemed
her
no
more
his
wife
since
he
was
married
to
her
at
the
age
of
twelve
years
an
age
wherein
he
was
not
capacitated
to
choose
good
or
evil
or
to
answer
for
himself
or
his
inclinations
and
though
she
were
a
lady
of
absolute
virtue
of
youth
wit
and
beauty
yet
fate
had
so
ordained
it
that
he
had
reserved
his
heart
to
this
moment
entirely
for
herself
and
that
he
renounced
all
pretenders
to
him
except
herself
that
he
had
now
possessed
the
princess
for
the
space
of
twenty
years
that
youth
had
a
long
race
to
run
and
could
not
take
up
at
those
years
with
one
single
beauty
that
hitherto
ravage
and
destruction
of
hearts
had
been
his
province
and
glory
and
that
he
thought
he
never
lost
time
but
when
he
was
a
little
while
constant
but
now
he
was
fixed
to
all
he
would
ever
possess
whilst
he
had
breath
and
that
she
was
both
his
mistress
and
his
wife
his
eternal
happiness
and
the
end
of
all
his
loving
it
is
there
he
said
he
would
remain
as
in
his
first
state
of
innocence
that
hitherto
his
ambition
had
been
above
his
passion
but
that
now
his
heart
was
so
entirely
subdued
to
this
fair
charmer
for
so
he
call
d
and
thought
her
that
he
could
be
content
to
live
and
die
in
the
glory
of
being
hers
alone
without
wishing
for
liberty
or
empire
but
to
render
her
more
glorious
a
thousand
things
tender
and
fond
he
said
to
this
purpose
and
the
result
of
all
ended
in
most
solemn
vows
that
if
ever
fortune
favoured
him
with
a
crown
he
would
fix
it
on
her
head
and
make
her
in
spite
of
all
former
ties
and
obligations
queen
of
this
was
sufficient
to
appease
her
sighs
and
tears
and
she
remained
entirely
satisfied
of
his
vows
which
were
exchanged
before
madam
the
countess
and
confirmed
by
all
the
binding
obligations
love
on
his
side
could
invent
and
ambition
and
subtlety
on
hers
when
i
came
at
any
time
to
visit
him
which
by
stealth
sometimes
i
did
to
take
orders
from
him
how
i
should
act
in
all
things
though
i
lay
concealed
like
himself
he
would
tell
me
all
that
had
passed
between
him
and
i
suppose
not
so
much
for
the
reposing
the
secret
in
my
breast
as
out
of
a
fond
pleasure
to
be
repeating
passages
of
his
dotage
and
repeating
her
name
which
was
ever
in
his
mouth
i
saw
she
had
reduced
him
to
a
great
degree
of
slavery
and
could
not
look
tamely
on
while
a
hero
so
young
so
gay
so
great
and
so
hopeful
lay
idling
away
his
precious
time
without
doing
any
thing
either
in
order
for
his
own
safety
or
ambition
it
was
my
lord
a
great
pity
to
see
how
his
noble
resolution
was
changed
and
how
he
was
perfectly
effeminated
into
soft
woman
i
endeavoured
at
first
to
rouse
him
from
this
lethargy
of
love
and
argued
with
him
the
little
reason
that
in
my
opinion
he
had
to
be
so
charmed
i
told
him
of
all
the
beauties
of
was
esteemed
one
of
the
meanest
and
that
if
ever
she
had
gained
a
conquest
as
many
she
was
infamously
famed
for
it
was
purely
the
force
of
her
youth
and
quality
but
that
now
that
bloom
was
past
and
she
was
one
of
those
which
in
less
quality
we
called
old
at
these
reproaches
of
his
judgement
i
often
perceived
him
to
blush
but
more
with
anger
than
shame
yet
because
according
to
the
vogue
of
the
town
he
found
there
was
reason
in
what
i
said
and
which
he
could
only
contradict
by
saying
however
she
was
she
appeared
all
otherwise
to
him
he
blamed
me
a
little
kindly
for
my
hard
words
against
her
and
began
to
swear
to
me
that
he
thought
her
all
over
charm
he
vowed
there
was
absolute
fascination
in
her
eyes
and
tongue
it
is
confessed
said
he
she
has
not
much
of
youth
nor
of
that
which
we
agree
to
call
beauty
but
she
has
a
grace
so
masculine
an
air
so
ravishing
a
wit
and
humour
so
absolutely
made
to
charm
that
they
all
together
sufficiently
recompense
for
her
want
of
delicacy
in
complexion
and
feature
and
in
a
word
my
cries
he
embracing
me
she
is
though
i
know
not
what
or
how
a
maid
that
compels
me
to
adore
her
she
has
a
natural
power
to
please
above
the
rest
of
her
dull
sex
and
i
can
abate
her
a
face
and
shape
and
yet
vie
her
for
beauty
with
any
of
the
celebrated
ones
of
found
by
the
manner
of
his
saying
this
that
he
was
really
charmed
and
past
all
retrieve
bewitched
to
this
lady
i
found
it
vain
therefore
to
press
him
to
a
separation
or
to
lessen
his
passion
but
on
the
contrary
told
him
there
was
a
time
for
all
things
if
fate
had
so
ordained
it
that
he
must
love
but
i
besought
him
with
all
the
eloquence
of
perfect
duty
and
friendship
not
to
suffer
his
passion
to
surmount
his
ambition
and
his
reason
so
far
as
to
neglect
his
interest
and
safety
and
for
a
little
pleasure
with
a
woman
suffer
all
his
friends
to
perish
that
had
woven
their
fortunes
with
his
and
must
stand
or
fall
as
he
thrived
i
implored
him
not
to
cast
away
the
which
was
so
far
advanced
and
that
yet
notwithstanding
this
discourse
might
all
be
retrieved
by
his
conduct
and
good
management
that
i
knew
however
the
king
appeared
in
outward
shew
to
be
offended
that
it
was
yet
in
his
power
to
calm
the
greatest
tempest
this
discovery
had
raised
that
it
was
but
casting
himself
at
his
majesty
s
feet
and
begging
his
mercy
by
a
confession
of
the
truth
of
some
part
of
the
matter
and
that
it
was
impossible
he
could
fail
of
a
pardon
from
so
indulgent
a
monarch
as
he
had
offended
that
there
was
no
action
could
wholly
rase
out
of
the
king
s
heart
that
tenderness
and
passion
he
had
ever
expressed
towards
him
and
his
peace
might
be
made
with
all
the
facility
imaginable
to
this
he
urged
a
very
great
reluctancy
and
cried
he
would
sooner
die
than
by
a
confession
expose
the
lives
of
his
friends
and
let
the
world
see
their
whole
design
before
they
had
power
to
effect
it
and
not
only
so
but
put
it
past
all
their
industry
ever
to
bring
so
hopeful
a
plot
about
again
at
this
i
smiled
and
asked
his
highness
s
pardon
told
him
i
was
of
another
opinion
as
most
of
the
heads
of
the
were
that
what
he
said
to
his
majesty
in
private
could
never
possibly
be
made
public
that
his
majesty
would
content
himself
with
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
without
caring
to
satisfy
the
world
so
greatly
to
the
prejudice
of
a
prince
of
the
blood
and
a
man
so
very
dear
to
him
as
himself
he
urged
the
fears
this
would
give
those
of
the
reformed
religion
and
alarm
them
with
a
thousand
apprehensions
that
it
would
discover
every
man
of
them
by
unravelling
the
intrigue
to
this
i
replied
that
their
fears
would
be
very
for
as
soon
as
he
had
by
his
submission
and
confession
gained
his
pardon
he
had
no
more
to
do
but
to
renounce
all
he
had
said
leave
the
court
and
put
himself
into
the
protection
of
his
friends
who
were
ready
to
receive
him
that
he
need
but
appear
abroad
a
little
time
and
he
would
see
himself
addressed
to
again
by
all
the
party
who
would
quickly
put
him
into
a
condition
of
fearing
nothing
counsel
with
the
same
persuasion
from
all
of
quality
of
the
party
who
came
to
see
him
was
at
last
approved
of
by
him
and
he
began
to
say
a
thousand
things
to
assure
me
of
his
fidelity
to
his
friends
and
the
faction
which
he
vowed
never
to
forsake
for
any
other
interest
but
to
stand
or
fall
in
its
defence
and
that
he
was
resolved
to
be
a
king
or
nothing
and
that
he
would
put
in
practice
all
the
arts
and
stratagems
of
cunning
as
well
as
force
to
attain
to
this
glorious
end
however
crooked
and
indirect
they
might
appear
to
fools
however
he
conceived
the
first
necessary
step
to
this
was
the
getting
his
pardon
to
gain
a
little
time
to
manage
things
anew
to
the
best
advantage
that
at
present
all
things
were
at
a
stand
without
life
or
motion
wanting
the
sight
of
himself
who
was
the
very
life
and
soul
of
motion
the
that
could
turn
the
wheel
of
fortune
round
about
again
now
he
had
talked
himself
in
to
sense
again
he
cried
oh
my
i
long
to
be
in
action
my
soul
is
on
the
wing
and
ready
to
take
its
flight
through
any
hazard
but
sighing
on
a
sudden
again
he
cried
but
oh
my
friend
my
wings
are
impt
by
love
i
can
not
mount
the
regions
of
the
air
and
thence
survey
the
world
but
still
as
i
would
rise
to
mightier
glory
they
flag
to
humble
love
and
fix
me
there
here
i
am
charmed
to
lazy
soft
repose
here
it
is
i
smile
and
play
and
love
away
my
hours
but
i
will
rouse
i
will
my
dear
nor
shall
the
winged
boy
hold
me
enslaved
believe
me
friend
he
shall
he
sent
me
away
pleased
with
this
and
i
left
him
to
his
supper
being
ready
to
come
upon
the
table
though
were
impatient
to
hear
the
story
out
yet
he
would
not
press
till
after
supper
in
which
time
they
discoursed
of
nothing
but
of
the
miracles
of
love
to
he
could
not
but
wonder
a
prince
so
young
so
amorous
and
so
gay
should
return
again
after
almost
fifteen
years
to
an
old
mistress
and
who
had
never
been
in
her
youth
a
celebrated
beauty
one
whom
it
was
imagined
the
king
and
several
after
him
at
court
had
made
a
gallantry
with
on
this
he
paused
for
some
time
and
reflected
on
his
passion
for
and
this
fantastic
intrigue
of
the
prince
s
inspired
him
with
a
kind
of
curiosity
to
try
whether
fleeting
love
would
carry
him
back
again
to
this
abandoned
maid
in
these
thoughts
and
such
discourse
they
passed
away
the
time
during
supper
which
ended
and
a
fresh
bottle
brought
to
the
table
with
a
new
command
that
none
should
interrupt
them
the
impatient
obliged
to
give
him
a
farther
account
of
the
prince
s
proceedings
which
he
did
in
this
manner
lord
having
left
the
prince
as
i
imagined
very
well
resolved
i
spoke
of
it
to
as
many
of
our
party
as
i
could
conveniently
meet
with
to
prepare
them
for
the
discovery
i
believed
the
prince
would
pretend
to
make
that
they
should
not
by
being
alarmed
at
the
first
news
of
it
put
themselves
into
fears
that
might
indeed
discover
them
nor
would
i
suffer
to
rest
but
daily
saw
him
or
rather
nightly
stole
to
him
to
keep
up
his
resolution
and
indeed
in
spite
of
love
to
which
he
had
made
himself
so
entire
a
slave
i
brought
him
to
his
own
house
to
visit
madam
his
wife
who
was
very
well
at
court
maugre
her
husband
s
ill
conduct
as
they
called
it
the
king
being
as
you
know
my
lord
extremely
kind
to
that
deserving
lady
often
made
her
visits
and
would
without
very
great
impatiency
hear
her
plead
for
her
husband
the
prince
and
possibly
it
was
not
ungrateful
to
him
all
this
we
daily
learned
from
a
page
who
secretly
brought
intelligence
from
madam
the
princess
so
that
we
conceived
it
wholly
necessary
for
the
interest
of
the
prince
that
he
should
live
in
a
good
understanding
with
this
prudent
lady
to
this
end
he
feigned
more
respect
than
usual
to
her
and
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
every
evening
made
her
his
visits
one
evening
amongst
the
rest
he
happened
to
be
there
just
as
the
proclamation
came
forth
of
four
thousand
crowns
to
any
that
could
discover
him
and
within
half
an
hour
after
came
the
king
to
visit
the
princess
as
every
night
he
did
her
lodging
being
in
the
court
the
king
came
without
giving
any
notice
and
with
a
very
slender
train
that
night
so
that
he
was
almost
in
the
princess
s
before
any
body
informed
her
he
was
there
so
that
the
prince
had
no
time
to
retire
but
into
madam
the
princess
s
cabaret
the
door
of
which
she
immediately
locking
made
such
a
noise
and
bustle
that
it
was
heard
by
his
majesty
who
nevertheless
had
passed
it
by
if
her
confusion
and
blushes
had
not
farther
betrayed
her
with
the
unusual
address
she
made
to
the
king
who
therefore
asked
her
who
she
had
concealed
in
her
closet
she
endeavoured
to
put
him
off
with
some
feigned
replies
but
it
would
not
do
the
more
her
confusion
the
more
the
king
was
inquisitive
and
urged
her
to
give
him
the
key
of
her
but
she
who
knew
the
life
of
the
prince
would
be
in
very
great
danger
should
he
be
taken
so
and
knew
on
the
other
side
that
to
deny
it
would
betray
the
truth
as
much
as
his
discovery
would
and
cause
him
either
to
force
the
key
or
the
door
fell
down
at
his
feet
and
wetting
his
shoes
with
her
tears
and
grasping
his
knees
with
her
trembling
arms
implored
that
mercy
and
pity
for
the
prince
her
husband
whom
her
virtue
had
rendered
dear
to
her
however
criminal
he
appeared
to
his
majesty
she
told
him
his
majesty
had
more
peculiarly
the
attributes
of
a
god
than
any
other
monarch
upon
earth
and
never
heard
the
wretched
or
the
innocent
plead
in
vain
she
told
him
that
herself
and
her
children
who
were
dearer
to
her
than
life
should
all
be
as
hostages
for
the
good
conduct
and
duty
of
the
prince
s
future
life
and
actions
and
they
would
all
be
obliged
to
suffer
any
death
though
ever
so
ignominious
upon
the
least
breaking
out
of
her
lord
that
he
should
utterly
abandon
those
of
the
reformed
religion
and
yield
to
what
articles
his
majesty
would
graciously
be
pleased
to
impose
quitting
all
his
false
and
unreasonable
pretensions
to
the
crown
which
was
only
the
effects
of
the
flattery
of
the
party
and
the
thus
with
the
virtue
and
goodness
of
an
angel
she
pleaded
with
such
moving
eloquence
mixed
with
tears
from
beautiful
eyes
that
she
failed
not
to
soften
the
royal
heart
who
knew
not
how
to
be
deaf
when
beauty
pleaded
yet
he
would
not
seem
to
yield
so
suddenly
lest
it
should
be
imagined
he
had
too
light
a
sense
of
his
treasons
which
in
any
other
great
man
would
have
been
punished
with
no
less
than
death
yet
as
she
pleaded
he
grew
calmer
and
suffered
it
without
interruption
till
she
waited
for
his
reply
and
obliged
him
by
her
silence
to
speak
he
numbers
up
the
obligations
he
had
heaped
on
her
husband
how
he
had
by
putting
all
places
of
great
command
and
interest
into
his
hands
made
him
the
greatest
prince
and
favourite
of
a
subject
in
the
world
and
infinitely
happier
than
a
monarch
that
he
had
all
the
glory
and
power
of
one
and
wanted
but
the
care
all
the
sweets
of
empire
while
all
that
was
disagreeable
and
toilsome
remained
with
the
title
alone
he
therefore
upbraided
him
with
infinite
ingratitude
and
want
of
honour
with
all
the
folly
of
ambitious
youth
and
left
nothing
unsaid
that
might
make
the
princess
sensible
it
was
too
late
to
hide
any
of
his
treasons
from
him
since
they
were
all
but
too
apparent
to
his
majesty
it
was
therefore
that
she
urged
nothing
but
his
royal
mercy
and
forgiveness
without
endeavouring
to
lessen
his
guilt
or
enlarge
on
his
innocency
in
fine
my
lord
so
well
she
spoke
that
at
last
she
had
the
joy
to
perceive
the
happy
effects
of
her
wit
and
goodness
which
had
moved
tears
of
pity
and
compassion
from
his
majesty
s
eyes
which
was
cue
to
come
forth
as
immediately
he
did
having
heard
all
that
had
passed
and
threw
himself
at
his
majesty
s
feet
and
this
was
the
critical
minute
he
was
to
snatch
for
the
gaining
of
his
point
and
of
which
he
made
a
most
admirable
use
he
called
up
all
the
force
of
necessary
dissimulation
tenderness
to
his
voice
tears
to
his
eyes
and
trembling
to
his
hands
that
stayed
the
too
willing
and
melting
monarch
by
his
robe
till
he
had
heard
him
implore
and
granted
him
his
pity
nor
did
he
quit
his
hold
till
the
king
cried
with
a
soft
voice
rise
at
which
he
was
assured
of
what
he
asked
he
refused
however
to
rise
till
the
pardon
was
pronounced
he
owned
himself
the
greatest
criminal
in
nature
that
he
was
drawn
from
his
allegiance
by
the
most
subtle
artifices
of
his
enemies
who
under
false
friendships
had
allured
his
hopes
with
gilded
promises
and
which
he
now
too
plainly
saw
were
designed
to
propagate
their
own
private
interests
and
not
his
glory
he
humbly
besought
his
majesty
to
make
some
gracious
allowances
for
his
vanities
of
youth
and
to
believe
now
he
had
so
dearly
bought
discretion
at
almost
the
price
of
his
majesty
s
eternal
displeasure
that
he
would
reform
and
lead
so
good
a
life
so
absolutely
free
from
any
appearance
of
ambition
that
his
majesty
should
see
he
had
not
a
more
faithful
subject
than
himself
in
fine
he
found
himself
by
this
acknowledgement
he
had
begun
with
to
advance
yet
further
nor
would
his
majesty
be
satisfied
without
the
whole
scene
of
the
matter
and
how
they
were
to
have
surprised
and
seized
him
where
and
by
what
numbers
all
which
he
was
forced
to
give
an
account
of
since
now
to
have
fallen
back
when
he
was
in
their
hands
had
been
his
infallible
ruin
all
which
he
performed
with
as
much
tenderness
and
respect
to
his
friends
concerned
as
if
his
own
life
had
been
depending
and
though
he
were
extremely
pressed
to
discover
some
of
the
great
ones
of
the
party
he
would
never
give
his
consent
to
an
action
so
mean
as
to
be
an
evidence
all
that
could
be
got
from
him
farther
was
to
promise
his
majesty
to
give
under
his
hand
what
he
had
in
private
confessed
to
him
with
which
the
king
remained
very
well
satisfied
and
ordered
him
to
come
to
court
the
next
day
thus
for
that
night
they
parted
with
infinite
caresses
on
the
king
s
part
and
no
little
joy
on
his
his
majesty
was
no
sooner
gone
but
he
gave
immediate
order
to
the
secretaries
of
state
to
draw
up
his
pardon
which
was
done
with
so
good
speed
that
he
had
it
in
his
hands
the
next
day
when
he
came
to
court
it
is
not
to
be
imagined
the
surprise
it
was
to
all
to
behold
the
man
in
the
greatest
state
imaginable
who
but
yesterday
was
to
have
been
crucified
at
any
price
and
those
who
most
exclaimed
against
him
were
the
first
that
paid
him
homage
and
caressed
him
at
the
highest
rate
only
the
most
wise
and
judicious
prophesied
his
glories
were
not
of
long
continuation
the
king
made
no
visits
where
the
prince
did
not
publicly
appear
he
told
all
the
people
with
infinite
joy
that
the
prince
had
confessed
the
whole
plot
and
that
he
would
give
it
under
his
hand
and
seal
in
order
to
have
it
published
throughout
all
for
the
satisfaction
of
all
those
who
had
been
deluded
and
deceived
by
our
specious
pretences
and
for
the
terror
of
those
who
had
any
ways
adhered
to
so
pernicious
a
villainy
so
that
he
met
with
nothing
but
reproaches
from
those
of
our
own
party
at
court
for
there
were
many
who
hitherto
were
unsuspected
and
who
now
out
of
fear
of
being
betrayed
by
the
prince
were
ready
to
fall
at
the
king
s
feet
and
confess
all
others
there
were
that
left
the
court
and
town
upon
it
in
fine
the
face
of
things
seemed
extremely
altered
while
the
prince
bore
himself
like
a
person
who
had
the
misfortune
justly
to
lie
beneath
the
exclamations
of
a
disobliged
multitude
as
they
at
least
imagined
and
bore
all
as
if
their
fears
had
been
true
without
so
much
as
offering
at
his
justification
to
confirm
his
majesty
s
good
opinion
of
him
he
added
to
his
pardon
a
present
of
twenty
thousand
crowns
half
of
it
being
paid
the
next
day
after
his
coming
to
court
and
in
short
my
lord
his
majesty
grew
so
fond
of
the
prince
he
could
not
endure
to
suffer
him
out
of
his
presence
and
was
never
satisfied
with
seeing
him
he
carried
him
the
next
day
to
the
public
with
him
to
shew
the
world
he
was
reconciled
but
by
this
time
he
had
all
confirmed
and
grew
impatient
to
declare
himself
to
his
friends
whom
he
would
not
have
remain
long
in
their
ill
opinion
of
him
it
happened
the
third
day
of
his
coming
to
court
in
returning
some
of
those
visits
he
had
received
from
all
the
great
persons
he
went
to
wait
upon
the
duchess
of
a
lady
who
had
ever
had
a
tender
respect
for
the
prince
in
the
time
of
this
visit
a
young
lady
of
quality
happened
to
come
in
one
whom
your
lordship
knows
a
great
wit
and
much
esteemed
at
court
by
this
lady
he
found
himself
welcomed
to
court
with
all
the
demonstrations
of
joy
as
also
by
the
old
duchess
who
had
divers
times
heretofore
persuaded
the
prince
to
leave
the
and
return
to
the
king
and
court
she
used
to
tell
him
he
was
a
handsome
youth
and
she
loved
his
mother
well
that
he
danced
finely
and
she
had
rather
see
him
in
a
ball
at
court
than
in
rebellion
in
the
field
and
often
to
this
purpose
her
love
would
rally
him
and
now
shewed
no
less
concern
of
joy
for
his
reconciliation
and
looking
on
him
as
a
true
convert
fell
a
railing
with
all
the
malice
and
wit
she
could
invent
at
those
knaves
who
had
seduced
him
she
railed
on
and
cursed
those
politics
which
had
betrayed
him
to
almost
ruin
itself
prince
heard
her
with
all
the
patience
he
could
for
some
time
but
when
he
found
her
touch
him
so
tenderly
and
name
his
friends
as
if
he
had
owned
any
such
ill
counsellors
his
colour
came
in
his
face
and
he
could
not
forbear
defending
us
with
all
the
force
of
friendship
he
told
her
he
knew
of
no
such
seducers
no
villains
of
the
party
nor
of
any
traitorous
design
that
either
himself
or
any
man
in
had
ever
harboured
at
which
she
going
to
upbraid
him
in
a
manner
too
passionate
he
thought
it
decent
to
end
his
visit
and
left
her
very
abruptly
at
his
going
out
he
met
with
the
duke
of
brother
to
the
duchess
going
to
visit
her
a
very
indifferent
ceremony
passed
on
both
sides
for
this
duke
never
had
entertained
a
friendship
or
scarce
a
respect
for
but
going
into
his
sister
s
the
duchess
her
chamber
he
found
her
all
in
a
rage
at
the
prince
s
so
public
defence
of
the
and
their
allies
and
the
duke
entering
they
told
him
what
had
passed
this
was
a
very
great
pleasure
to
him
who
had
a
mortal
hate
at
this
time
to
the
prince
he
made
his
visit
very
short
hastens
to
court
and
went
directly
to
the
king
and
told
him
how
infinitely
he
found
his
majesty
mistaken
in
the
imagined
penitence
of
the
prince
and
then
told
him
what
he
had
said
at
the
duchess
of
lodgings
and
had
disowned
he
ever
confessed
any
treasonable
design
against
his
majesty
and
gave
them
the
lie
who
durst
charge
him
with
any
such
villainy
the
king
who
was
unwilling
to
credit
what
he
wished
not
true
plainly
told
the
duke
he
could
not
believe
it
but
that
it
was
the
malice
of
his
enemies
who
had
forged
this
the
duke
replied
he
would
bring
those
to
his
majesty
that
heard
the
words
immediately
thereupon
dispatched
away
his
page
to
beg
the
duchess
would
come
to
court
with
the
duchess
suspecting
the
truth
of
the
business
and
unwilling
to
do
the
prince
an
ill
office
excused
herself
by
sending
word
she
was
ill
of
the
colic
but
who
loved
the
king
s
interest
and
found
the
ingratitude
as
she
called
it
of
the
prince
hastened
in
her
chair
to
court
and
justified
all
the
duke
had
said
who
being
a
woman
of
great
wit
and
honour
found
that
credit
which
the
duke
failed
of
as
an
open
enemy
to
the
prince
about
an
hour
after
the
prince
appeared
at
court
and
found
the
face
of
things
changed
extremely
and
those
who
before
had
kissed
his
hand
and
were
proud
of
every
smile
from
him
now
beheld
him
with
coldness
and
scarce
made
way
as
he
passed
however
he
went
to
the
presence
and
found
the
king
whose
looks
were
also
very
much
changed
who
taking
him
into
the
shewed
him
his
whole
confession
drawn
up
ready
for
him
to
sign
as
he
had
promised
though
he
never
intended
any
such
thing
and
now
resolved
to
die
rather
than
do
it
he
took
it
in
his
hand
while
the
king
cried
here
keep
your
word
and
sign
your
narrative
stay
sir
replied
the
prince
i
have
the
counsel
of
my
friends
to
ask
in
so
weighty
an
the
king
confirmed
in
all
he
had
heard
no
longer
doubted
but
he
had
been
too
cunning
for
him
and
going
out
in
a
very
great
discontent
he
only
cried
sir
if
you
have
any
better
friends
than
myself
i
leave
you
to
them
and
with
this
left
him
the
prince
was
very
glad
he
had
got
the
hoping
it
would
never
come
to
light
again
the
king
was
the
only
person
to
whom
he
had
made
the
confession
and
he
was
but
one
accuser
and
him
he
thought
the
party
could
at
any
time
be
too
powerful
to
oppose
all
being
easily
believed
on
their
side
and
nothing
on
that
of
the
court
after
this
in
the
evening
the
king
going
to
visit
madam
the
duchess
of
for
whom
he
had
a
very
great
esteem
and
whither
every
day
the
whole
court
followed
him
the
prince
with
all
the
assurance
imaginable
made
his
court
there
also
but
he
was
no
sooner
come
into
the
presence
but
he
perceived
anger
in
the
eyes
of
that
monarch
who
had
indeed
a
peculiar
greatness
and
fierceness
there
when
angry
a
minute
after
he
sent
monsieur
to
the
prince
with
a
command
to
leave
the
court
and
without
much
ceremony
he
accordingly
departed
and
went
directly
to
who
with
all
the
impatience
of
love
expected
him
nor
was
much
surprised
to
find
him
banished
the
court
for
he
made
her
acquainted
with
his
most
secret
designs
who
having
made
all
his
interests
her
own
espoused
whatever
related
to
him
and
was
capable
of
retaining
all
with
great
fidelity
nor
had
he
quitted
her
one
night
since
his
coming
to
court
and
he
hath
often
with
rapture
told
me
was
a
friend
as
well
as
a
mistress
and
one
with
whom
when
the
first
play
was
ended
he
could
discourse
with
of
useful
things
of
state
as
well
as
love
and
improve
in
both
the
noble
mysteries
by
her
charming
conversation
the
night
of
this
second
disgrace
i
went
to
to
visit
him
where
we
discoursed
what
was
next
to
be
done
he
did
not
think
his
pardon
was
sufficient
to
secure
him
and
he
was
not
willing
to
trust
a
king
who
might
be
convinced
that
that
tenderness
he
had
for
him
was
absolutely
against
the
peace
and
quiet
of
all
i
was
of
this
opinion
so
that
upon
farther
debate
we
thought
it
absolutely
necessary
to
quit
till
the
court
s
heat
should
be
a
little
abated
and
that
the
king
might
imagine
himself
by
his
absence
in
more
tranquillity
than
he
really
is
in
order
to
this
he
made
me
take
my
flight
into
here
to
provide
all
things
necessary
against
his
coming
and
i
received
his
command
to
seek
you
out
and
beg
you
would
attend
his
coming
hither
i
expect
him
every
day
he
told
me
at
parting
he
longed
to
consult
with
you
how
next
to
play
this
mighty
game
on
which
so
many
kingdoms
are
staked
and
which
he
is
resolved
to
win
or
be
an
imperfect
relation
replied
we
had
of
this
affair
but
i
never
could
learn
by
what
artifice
the
prince
brought
about
his
good
fortune
at
court
but
of
your
own
escape
i
have
heard
nothing
pray
oblige
me
with
the
relation
of
sir
said
there
is
so
little
worthy
the
trouble
you
will
take
in
hearing
it
that
you
may
spare
yourself
the
sir
replied
philander
i
always
had
too
great
a
share
in
what
concerned
you
not
to
be
curious
of
the
in
which
replied
though
there
be
nothing
novel
i
will
satisfy
pleased
to
know
my
lord
that
about
a
week
before
our
design
was
fully
discovered
by
some
of
our
own
i
had
taken
a
great
house
in
st
for
my
mistress
whom
you
know
my
lord
i
had
lived
with
the
space
of
a
year
she
was
gone
to
drink
the
waters
of
for
some
indisposition
and
i
had
promised
her
all
things
should
be
fitted
against
her
return
agreeable
to
her
humour
and
desire
and
indeed
i
spared
no
cost
to
make
her
apartment
magnificent
and
i
believe
few
women
of
quality
could
purchase
one
so
rich
for
i
loved
the
young
woman
who
had
beauty
and
discretion
enough
to
charm
though
the
of
the
royal
party
called
her
which
was
given
her
in
derision
to
me
not
to
her
for
whom
every
body
for
her
own
sake
had
a
considerable
esteem
besides
my
lord
i
had
taken
up
money
out
of
the
orphans
and
widows
bank
from
the
chamber
of
and
could
very
well
afford
to
be
lavish
when
i
spent
upon
the
public
stock
while
i
was
thus
ordering
all
things
my
valet
came
running
out
of
breath
to
tell
me
that
being
at
the
he
saw
several
persons
carried
to
the
secretary
s
office
with
messengers
and
that
inquiring
who
they
might
be
he
found
they
were
two
who
had
offered
themselves
to
the
messengers
to
be
carried
to
be
examined
about
a
plot
the
prince
and
those
of
the
reformed
religion
had
to
surprise
his
majesty
kill
monsieur
his
brother
and
set
all
in
a
flame
and
as
to
what
particularly
related
to
myself
he
said
that
i
was
named
as
the
person
designed
to
seize
upon
the
king
s
guards
and
dispatch
monsieur
this
my
own
conscience
told
me
was
too
true
for
me
to
make
any
doubt
but
i
was
discovered
i
therefore
left
a
servant
in
the
house
and
in
a
took
my
flight
i
drove
a
little
out
of
till
night
and
then
returned
again
as
the
surest
part
of
the
world
where
i
could
conceal
myself
i
was
not
long
in
studying
who
i
should
trust
with
my
life
and
safety
but
went
directly
to
the
palace
of
madam
the
countess
of
who
you
know
my
lord
was
a
widow
and
a
woman
who
had
for
a
year
past
a
most
violent
passion
for
me
but
she
being
a
lady
who
had
made
many
such
gallantries
and
past
her
youth
i
had
only
a
very
great
respect
and
acknowledgement
for
her
and
her
quality
and
being
obliged
to
her
for
the
effects
of
her
tenderness
shewn
upon
several
occasions
i
could
not
but
acquit
myself
like
a
to
her
whenever
i
could
possibly
and
which
though
i
have
a
thousand
times
feigned
great
business
to
prevent
yet
i
could
not
always
be
ungrateful
and
when
i
paid
her
my
services
it
was
ever
extremely
well
received
and
because
of
her
quality
and
setting
up
for
a
second
marriage
she
always
took
care
to
make
my
approaches
to
her
in
as
concealed
a
manner
as
possible
and
only
her
porter
one
page
and
one
woman
knew
this
secret
amour
and
for
the
better
carrying
it
on
i
ever
went
in
a
lest
my
livery
should
be
seen
at
her
gate
and
as
it
was
my
custom
at
other
times
so
i
now
sent
the
porter
who
by
my
bounty
and
his
lady
s
was
entirely
my
own
creature
for
the
page
to
come
to
me
who
immediately
did
and
i
desired
him
to
let
his
lady
know
i
waited
her
commands
that
was
the
word
he
immediately
brought
me
answer
that
by
good
fortune
his
lady
was
all
alone
and
infinitely
wishing
she
knew
where
to
send
him
for
me
and
i
immediately
at
that
good
news
ran
up
to
her
chamber
where
i
was
no
sooner
come
but
desiring
me
to
sit
she
ordered
her
porter
to
be
called
and
gave
orders
upon
pain
of
life
not
to
tell
of
my
being
in
the
house
whatever
inquiry
should
be
made
after
me
and
having
given
the
same
command
to
her
page
she
dismissed
them
and
came
to
me
with
all
the
fear
and
trembling
imaginable
ah
monsieur
cried
she
falling
on
my
neck
we
are
undone
i
not
imagining
she
had
heard
the
news
already
cried
why
is
my
passion
discovered
ah
replied
she
in
tears
i
would
to
heaven
it
were
no
worse
would
all
the
earth
had
discovered
that
which
i
should
esteem
my
glory
but
it
is
my
charming
monsieur
continued
she
your
treasons
and
not
amour
whose
discovery
will
be
so
fatal
to
at
this
i
seemed
amazed
and
begged
her
to
let
me
understand
her
she
told
me
what
i
have
said
before
and
moreover
that
the
council
had
that
very
evening
issued
out
warrants
for
me
and
she
admired
how
i
escaped
after
a
little
discourse
of
this
kind
i
asked
her
what
she
would
advise
me
to
do
for
i
was
very
well
assured
the
violent
hate
the
king
had
particularly
for
me
would
make
him
never
consent
i
should
live
on
any
terms
and
therefore
it
was
determined
i
should
not
surrender
myself
and
she
resolved
to
run
the
risk
of
concealing
me
which
in
fine
she
did
three
days
furnishing
me
with
money
and
necessaries
for
my
flight
in
this
time
a
proclamation
came
forth
and
offered
five
hundred
crowns
for
my
head
or
to
seize
me
alive
or
dead
this
sum
so
wrought
with
the
slavish
minds
of
men
that
no
art
was
left
unassayed
to
take
me
they
searched
all
houses
all
that
passed
by
night
and
did
all
that
avarice
could
inspire
to
take
me
but
all
in
vain
at
last
this
glorious
sum
so
dazzled
the
mind
of
madam
the
countess
s
porter
that
he
went
to
a
captain
of
the
musketeers
and
assured
him
if
the
king
would
give
him
the
aforesaid
sum
he
would
betray
me
and
bring
him
the
following
night
to
surprise
me
without
any
resistance
the
captain
who
thought
if
the
porter
should
have
all
the
sum
he
should
get
none
and
every
one
hoping
to
be
the
happy
man
that
should
take
me
and
win
the
prize
could
not
endure
another
should
have
the
glory
of
both
and
so
never
told
the
king
of
the
offer
the
porter
had
made
but
however
secret
one
may
imagine
an
amour
to
be
kept
yet
in
so
busy
a
place
as
and
the
apartments
of
the
this
of
ours
had
been
discoursed
and
the
intrigue
more
than
suspected
whether
this
or
the
captain
before
named
imagined
to
find
me
at
the
house
of
the
countess
because
the
porter
had
made
such
an
offer
i
say
however
it
was
the
next
morning
upon
a
the
guards
broke
into
several
chambers
and
missing
me
had
the
insolence
to
come
to
the
door
of
that
of
the
countess
and
she
had
only
time
to
slip
on
her
and
running
to
the
door
besought
them
to
have
respect
to
her
sex
and
quality
while
i
started
from
my
bed
which
was
the
same
from
whence
the
countess
rose
and
not
knowing
where
to
hide
or
what
to
do
concealing
my
clothes
between
the
sheets
i
mounted
from
the
table
to
a
great
silver
sconce
that
was
fastened
to
the
wall
by
the
and
from
thence
made
but
one
spring
up
to
the
tester
of
the
bed
which
being
one
of
those
raised
with
strong
and
japan
i
could
easily
do
or
rather
it
was
by
miracle
i
did
it
and
laid
myself
along
the
top
while
my
back
touched
the
ceiling
of
the
chamber
by
this
time
when
no
entreaties
could
prevail
they
had
burst
open
the
and
running
directly
to
the
bed
they
could
not
believe
their
eyes
they
saw
no
person
there
but
the
plain
print
of
two
with
the
pillows
for
two
persons
this
gave
them
the
curiosity
to
search
farther
which
they
did
with
their
swords
under
the
bed
in
every
corner
behind
every
curtain
up
the
chimney
felt
all
about
the
wainscot
and
hangings
for
false
doors
or
closets
surveyed
the
floor
for
a
at
last
they
found
my
fringed
gloves
at
the
window
and
the
sash
a
little
up
and
then
they
concluded
i
had
made
my
escape
out
at
that
window
this
thought
they
seemed
confirmed
in
and
therefore
ran
to
the
garden
where
they
thought
i
had
descended
and
with
my
gloves
which
they
bore
away
as
the
trophies
of
their
almost
gained
victory
they
searched
every
hedge
and
bush
arbour
grotto
and
tree
but
not
being
able
to
find
what
they
sought
they
concluded
me
gone
and
told
all
the
town
how
very
near
they
were
to
seizing
me
after
this
the
very
porter
and
page
believed
me
escaped
out
of
that
window
and
there
was
no
farther
search
made
after
me
but
the
countess
was
amazed
as
much
as
any
of
the
soldiers
to
find
which
way
i
had
conveyed
myself
when
i
came
down
and
undeceived
her
but
when
she
saw
from
whence
i
came
she
wondered
more
than
before
how
i
could
get
up
so
high
when
trying
the
trick
again
i
could
not
do
it
if
i
might
have
won
never
so
considerable
a
wager
upon
it
without
pulling
down
the
sconce
and
the
tester
also
this
i
remained
there
undiscovered
the
whole
time
the
prince
was
at
till
his
coming
to
court
when
i
verily
believed
he
would
have
gained
me
my
pardon
with
his
own
but
the
king
had
sworn
my
final
destruction
if
he
ever
got
me
in
his
power
and
proclaiming
me
a
traitor
seized
all
they
could
find
of
mine
it
was
then
that
i
believed
it
high
time
to
take
my
flight
which
as
soon
as
i
heard
the
prince
again
in
disgrace
i
did
and
got
safely
into
where
i
remained
about
six
weeks
but
oh
what
is
woman
the
first
news
i
heard
and
that
was
while
i
remained
at
the
countess
s
that
my
mistress
for
whom
i
had
taken
such
cares
and
who
had
professed
to
love
me
above
all
things
no
sooner
heard
i
was
fled
and
proscribed
but
retiring
to
a
friend
s
house
for
her
own
was
seized
for
mine
and
the
officers
imagining
me
there
too
they
came
to
search
and
a
young
of
a
noble
aspect
great
wit
and
courage
and
indeed
a
very
fine
gentleman
was
the
officer
that
entered
her
chamber
to
search
for
me
who
being
at
first
sight
surprised
with
her
beauty
and
melting
with
her
tears
fell
most
desperately
in
love
with
her
and
after
hearing
how
she
had
lost
all
her
money
plate
and
jewels
and
rich
furniture
offered
her
his
service
to
retrieve
them
and
did
do
it
and
from
one
favour
to
another
continued
so
to
oblige
the
fair
fickle
creature
that
he
won
with
that
and
his
handsome
mien
a
possession
of
her
heart
and
she
yielded
in
a
week
s
time
to
my
most
mortal
enemy
and
the
countess
who
at
my
going
from
her
swooned
and
bathed
me
all
in
tears
making
a
thousand
vows
of
fidelity
and
never
to
favour
mankind
more
this
very
woman
sir
as
soon
as
my
back
was
turned
made
new
advances
to
a
young
lord
who
believing
her
to
be
none
of
the
most
faithful
would
not
trust
her
under
matrimony
he
being
a
man
of
no
great
fortune
and
she
a
mistress
of
a
very
considerable
one
his
standing
off
on
these
terms
inflames
her
the
more
and
i
have
advice
that
she
is
very
much
in
love
with
him
and
it
is
believed
will
do
what
he
desires
of
her
so
that
i
was
no
sooner
abandoned
by
fortune
but
fickle
woman
followed
her
example
and
fled
me
too
thus
my
lord
you
have
the
history
of
my
double
unhappiness
and
i
am
waiting
here
a
fate
which
no
human
wit
can
guess
at
the
arrival
of
the
prince
will
give
a
little
life
to
our
affair
and
i
yet
have
hope
to
see
him
in
at
the
head
of
forty
thousand
to
revenge
all
the
insolences
we
have
after
discoursing
of
several
things
and
of
the
fate
of
several
persons
it
was
and
they
taking
leave
each
man
departed
to
his
chamber
while
he
was
undressing
being
alone
with
began
to
discourse
of
and
to
take
some
care
of
letting
her
know
he
was
arrived
at
and
for
her
convoy
thither
who
even
yet
retained
some
unaccountable
hope
as
lovers
do
of
one
day
being
happy
with
that
fair
one
and
believing
he
could
not
be
so
with
so
much
felicity
while
she
was
in
the
hands
of
as
those
of
would
never
tell
his
lord
his
sentiments
of
her
conduct
nor
of
her
love
to
and
those
other
passages
that
had
occurred
in
he
only
cried
he
believed
she
might
be
overcome
being
left
to
herself
and
by
the
merits
and
good
fashion
of
but
would
not
give
his
master
an
absolute
fear
or
any
account
of
truth
that
he
might
live
with
her
again
if
possible
as
before
and
that
she
might
hold
herself
so
obliged
to
him
for
silence
in
these
affairs
as
might
one
day
render
him
happy
these
were
the
unweighed
reasons
he
gave
for
deluding
his
lord
into
a
kind
opinion
to
the
fickle
maid
but
ever
when
he
named
could
perceive
his
blushes
rise
and
from
them
believed
there
was
something
behind
in
his
thought
which
he
had
a
mind
to
know
he
therefore
pressed
him
to
the
last
degree
and
cried
come
confess
to
me
the
reason
of
your
blushes
i
know
you
are
a
lover
and
i
was
content
to
suffer
you
my
rival
knowing
your
respect
to
this
though
he
spoke
smiling
raised
a
greater
confusion
in
heart
i
own
my
lord
said
he
i
have
in
spite
of
that
respect
and
all
the
force
of
my
soul
had
the
daring
to
love
her
whom
you
loved
but
still
the
consideration
of
my
obligations
to
your
lordship
surmounted
that
saucy
flame
notwithstanding
all
the
encouragement
of
your
inconstancy
and
the
advantage
of
the
rage
it
put
sylvia
in
against
how
cried
does
know
then
of
my
falseness
and
is
it
certain
that
has
betrayed
me
to
her
with
that
was
forced
to
advance
and
with
a
design
of
some
revenge
upon
who
he
hoped
would
be
challenged
by
his
lord
where
one
or
both
might
fall
in
the
rencounter
and
leave
him
master
of
his
hopes
he
told
him
all
that
had
passed
between
them
all
but
real
possession
which
he
only
imagined
but
laid
the
whole
weight
on
making
act
but
as
an
incensed
woman
purely
out
of
high
revenge
and
resentment
of
so
great
an
injury
as
was
done
her
love
he
farther
told
him
how
in
the
extravagancy
of
her
rage
she
had
resolved
to
marry
and
how
he
prevented
it
by
making
a
public
declaration
she
was
his
wife
already
and
for
which
procured
the
to
put
him
in
prison
but
by
an
accident
that
happened
to
the
uncle
of
for
which
he
was
forced
to
fly
the
released
him
when
he
came
to
his
lord
how
cried
and
is
the
traitor
fled
from
and
from
the
reach
of
my
chastisement
yes
replied
and
not
to
hold
you
longer
from
the
truth
has
forced
away
with
at
this
grew
into
a
violent
rage
sometimes
against
for
his
treasons
against
friendship
sometimes
he
felt
the
old
flame
revive
raised
and
blown
jealousy
and
was
raving
to
imagine
any
other
should
possess
the
lovely
he
now
beholds
her
with
all
those
charms
that
first
fired
him
and
thinks
if
she
be
criminal
it
was
only
the
effects
of
the
greatest
love
which
always
hurries
women
on
to
the
highest
revenges
in
vain
he
seeks
to
extinguish
his
returning
flame
by
the
thought
of
yet
at
that
thought
he
starts
like
one
awakened
from
a
dream
of
honour
to
fall
asleep
again
and
dream
of
love
before
it
was
rage
and
pride
but
now
it
was
tenderness
and
grief
softer
passions
and
more
insupportable
new
wounds
smart
most
but
old
ones
are
most
dangerous
while
he
was
thus
raging
walking
pausing
and
loving
one
knocked
at
his
it
was
page
who
had
waited
all
the
evening
to
speak
to
him
and
could
not
till
now
be
admitted
was
just
going
to
tell
him
he
was
there
before
when
he
arrived
now
again
was
all
unbuttoned
his
stockings
down
and
his
hair
under
his
cap
when
the
page
being
let
in
by
ran
to
his
lord
who
knew
him
and
embraced
him
and
it
was
a
pretty
while
they
thus
caressed
each
other
without
the
power
of
speaking
he
of
asking
a
question
and
the
boy
of
delivering
his
message
at
last
he
gave
him
billet
which
was
thus
philander
false
and
perjured
as
you
are
i
languish
for
a
sight
of
you
and
conjure
you
to
give
it
me
as
soon
as
this
comes
to
your
hands
imagine
not
that
i
have
prepared
those
instruments
of
revenge
that
are
so
justly
due
to
your
perfidy
but
rather
that
i
have
yet
too
tender
sentiments
for
you
in
spite
of
the
outrage
you
have
done
my
heart
and
that
for
all
the
ruin
you
have
made
i
still
adore
you
and
though
i
know
you
now
another
s
slave
yet
i
beg
you
would
vouchsafe
to
behold
the
spoils
you
have
made
and
allow
me
this
recompense
for
all
to
say
here
was
the
beauty
i
once
esteemed
though
now
she
is
no
more
sylvia
cried
he
out
no
more
by
heaven
i
had
rather
be
no
more
and
at
that
word
without
considering
whether
he
were
in
order
for
a
visit
or
not
he
advancing
his
joyful
voice
cried
out
to
the
page
lead
on
my
faithful
boy
lead
on
to
in
vain
beseeches
him
to
put
himself
into
a
better
equipage
in
vain
he
urges
to
him
the
indecency
of
making
a
visit
in
that
posture
he
thought
of
nothing
but
however
he
ran
after
him
with
his
hat
cloak
and
comb
and
as
he
was
in
the
chair
dressed
his
hair
and
suffered
the
page
to
conduct
him
where
he
pleased
which
being
to
lodgings
he
ran
up
stairs
and
into
her
chamber
as
by
instinct
of
love
and
found
her
laid
on
her
bed
to
which
he
made
but
one
step
from
the
door
and
catching
her
in
his
arms
as
he
kneeled
upon
the
carpet
they
both
remained
unable
to
utter
any
thing
but
sighs
and
surely
never
appeared
more
charming
she
had
for
a
month
or
two
lived
at
her
ease
and
had
besides
all
the
advantage
of
fine
dressing
which
she
had
purposely
put
on
in
the
most
tempting
fashion
on
purpose
to
engage
him
or
rather
to
make
him
see
how
fine
a
creature
his
perfidy
had
lost
him
she
first
broke
silence
and
with
a
thousand
violent
reproaches
seemed
as
if
she
would
fain
break
from
those
arms
which
she
wished
might
be
too
strong
for
her
force
while
he
endeavours
to
appease
her
as
lovers
do
protesting
a
thousand
times
that
there
was
nothing
in
that
history
of
his
amour
with
but
revenge
on
who
he
knew
was
making
an
interest
in
her
heart
contrary
to
all
the
laws
of
honour
and
friendship
for
he
had
learned
by
the
reproaches
of
the
lady
abbess
that
was
sister
to
he
has
had
the
daring
to
confess
to
me
his
passion
said
he
for
you
and
could
i
do
less
in
revenge
than
to
tell
him
i
had
one
for
his
sister
i
knew
by
the
violent
reproaches
i
ever
met
with
in
your
letters
though
they
were
not
plainly
confessed
that
he
had
played
me
foul
and
discovered
my
feigned
intrigue
to
you
and
even
this
i
suffered
to
see
how
far
you
could
be
prevailed
with
against
me
i
knew
had
charms
of
youth
and
wit
and
that
you
had
too
much
the
ascendant
over
him
to
be
denied
any
secret
you
had
a
mind
to
draw
from
him
i
knew
your
nature
too
curious
and
your
love
too
inquisitive
not
to
press
him
to
a
sight
of
my
letters
which
seen
must
incense
you
and
this
trial
i
designedly
made
of
your
faith
and
as
a
return
to
thus
he
flatters
and
she
believes
because
she
has
a
mind
to
believe
and
thus
by
degrees
he
softens
the
listening
swears
his
faith
with
sighs
and
confirms
it
with
his
tears
which
bedewed
her
fair
bosom
as
they
fell
from
his
bright
dissembling
eyes
and
yet
so
well
he
dissembled
that
he
scarce
knew
himself
that
he
did
so
and
such
effects
it
wrought
on
that
in
spite
of
all
her
honour
and
vows
engaged
to
and
horrid
protestations
never
to
receive
again
the
fugitive
to
her
arms
she
suffers
all
he
asks
gives
herself
up
again
to
love
and
is
a
second
time
undone
she
regards
him
as
one
to
whom
she
had
a
peculiar
right
as
the
first
lover
she
was
married
to
his
love
to
his
heart
and
appeared
the
intruding
gallant
that
would
and
ought
to
be
content
with
the
gleanings
of
the
harvest
should
give
him
the
opportunity
to
take
up
and
though
if
she
had
at
this
very
time
been
put
to
her
sober
choice
which
she
would
have
abandoned
it
would
have
been
as
not
in
so
good
circumstances
at
that
time
to
gratify
all
her
extravagances
of
expense
but
she
would
not
endure
to
think
of
losing
either
she
was
for
two
reasons
covetous
of
both
and
swore
fidelity
to
both
protesting
each
the
only
man
and
she
was
now
contriving
in
her
thoughts
how
to
play
the
jilt
most
artificially
a
though
natural
enough
to
her
sex
she
had
not
yet
much
essayed
and
never
to
this
purpose
she
knew
well
she
should
have
need
of
all
her
cunning
in
this
affair
for
she
had
to
do
with
men
of
quality
and
honour
and
too
much
wit
to
be
grossly
imposed
upon
she
knew
loved
so
well
it
would
either
make
her
lose
him
by
death
or
resenting
pride
if
she
should
ever
be
discovered
to
him
to
be
untrue
and
she
knew
she
should
lose
to
some
new
mistress
if
he
once
perceived
her
false
he
asked
her
a
thousand
questions
concerning
and
she
seemed
to
lavish
every
secret
of
her
soul
to
her
lover
but
like
a
right
woman
so
ordered
her
discourse
as
all
that
made
for
her
advantage
she
declared
and
all
the
rest
she
concealed
she
told
him
that
those
hopes
which
her
revenge
had
made
her
give
had
obliged
him
to
present
her
with
such
and
such
fine
jewels
such
plate
such
sums
and
in
fine
made
him
understand
that
all
her
trophies
from
the
believing
lover
should
be
laid
at
his
feet
who
had
conquered
her
heart
and
that
now
having
enriched
herself
she
would
abandon
him
wholly
to
despair
this
did
not
so
well
satisfy
philander
but
that
he
needed
some
greater
proofs
of
her
fidelity
fearing
all
these
rich
presents
were
not
for
a
little
hope
alone
and
she
failed
not
giving
what
protestations
he
desired
thus
the
night
passed
away
and
in
the
morning
she
knowing
he
was
not
very
well
furnished
with
money
gave
him
the
key
of
her
cabinet
where
she
bid
him
furnish
himself
with
all
he
wanted
which
he
did
and
left
her
to
go
take
orders
about
his
horses
and
other
affairs
not
so
absolutely
satisfied
of
her
virtue
but
he
feared
himself
put
upon
which
the
advantage
he
was
likely
to
reap
by
the
deceit
made
him
less
consider
than
he
would
perhaps
otherwise
have
done
he
had
all
the
night
a
full
possession
of
and
found
in
the
morning
he
was
not
so
violently
concerned
as
he
was
over
night
it
was
but
a
repetition
of
what
he
had
been
feasted
with
before
it
was
no
new
treat
but
like
matrimony
went
dully
down
and
now
he
found
his
heart
warm
a
little
more
for
with
which
little
impatience
he
left
that
morning
a
lady
having
sent
to
to
give
her
an
assignation
in
the
park
though
he
were
not
curious
after
beauty
yet
believing
there
might
be
something
more
in
it
than
merely
a
lady
he
dressed
himself
and
went
which
was
the
reason
he
made
not
his
visit
that
morning
as
he
used
to
do
to
and
so
was
yet
ignorant
of
her
ingratitude
while
she
on
the
other
side
finding
herself
more
possessed
with
vanity
than
love
for
having
gained
her
end
as
she
imagined
and
a
second
victory
over
his
heart
in
spite
of
all
charms
she
did
not
so
much
consider
him
as
before
nor
was
he
so
dear
to
her
as
she
fancied
he
would
have
been
before
she
believed
it
possible
to
get
him
any
more
to
her
arms
and
she
found
it
was
pride
and
revenge
to
that
made
her
so
fond
of
endearing
him
and
that
she
should
thereby
triumph
over
that
haughty
rival
who
pretended
to
be
so
sure
of
the
heart
of
her
hero
and
having
satisfied
her
ambition
in
that
point
she
was
more
pleased
than
she
imagined
she
should
be
and
could
now
turn
her
thoughts
again
to
whose
charms
whose
endearments
and
lavish
obligations
came
anew
to
her
memory
and
made
him
appear
the
most
agreeable
to
her
genius
and
humour
which
now
leaned
to
interest
more
than
love
and
now
she
fancies
she
found
duller
in
her
arms
than
that
he
tasted
of
while
was
all
her
own
entirely
adoring
and
ever
presenting
two
excellencies
of
which
now
had
but
part
of
one
she
found
now
in
a
condition
to
be
ever
taking
from
her
while
was
still
to
be
giving
which
was
a
great
weight
in
the
scale
of
love
when
a
fair
woman
guides
the
balance
and
now
she
begins
to
distrust
all
that
had
said
of
his
innocence
from
what
she
now
remembers
she
heard
from
herself
and
reproaches
her
own
weakness
for
believing
while
her
penitent
thoughts
were
thus
wandering
in
favour
of
that
lover
arrived
and
approached
her
with
all
the
joy
in
his
soul
and
eyes
that
either
could
express
it
is
now
my
fair
charmer
said
he
that
i
am
come
to
offer
you
what
alone
can
make
me
more
worthy
of
you
and
pulling
from
his
pocket
the
writings
and
inventories
of
all
his
own
and
his
uncle
s
estate
see
here
said
he
what
those
mighty
powers
that
favour
love
have
done
for
it
is
not
continued
he
the
trifle
of
a
million
of
money
which
these
amount
to
that
has
pleased
me
but
because
i
am
now
able
to
lay
it
without
control
at
your
if
she
were
before
inclined
to
receive
him
well
what
was
she
now
when
a
million
of
money
rendered
him
so
charming
she
embraced
his
neck
with
her
snowy
arms
laid
her
cheeks
to
his
ravished
face
and
kissed
him
a
thousand
welcomes
so
well
she
knew
how
to
make
herself
mistress
of
all
this
vast
fortune
and
i
suppose
he
never
appeared
so
fine
as
at
this
moment
while
she
thus
caressed
him
he
could
not
forbear
sighing
as
if
there
were
yet
something
behind
to
complete
his
happiness
for
though
octavio
were
extremely
blinded
with
love
he
had
abundance
of
wit
and
a
great
many
doubts
which
were
augmented
by
the
arrival
of
and
he
was
too
wise
and
too
haughty
to
be
imposed
upon
at
least
as
he
believed
and
yet
he
had
so
very
good
an
opinion
of
honour
and
vows
which
she
had
engaged
to
him
that
he
durst
hardly
name
his
fears
when
by
his
sighs
she
found
them
and
willing
to
leave
no
obstacle
unremoved
that
might
hinder
her
possessing
this
fortune
she
told
him
my
dear
i
am
sensible
these
sighs
proceed
from
some
fears
you
have
of
being
in
and
consequently
that
i
will
see
him
as
heretofore
but
be
assured
that
that
false
man
shall
no
more
dare
to
pretend
to
me
but
on
the
contrary
i
will
behold
him
as
my
mortal
enemy
the
murderer
of
my
fame
and
innocence
and
as
the
most
ungrateful
and
perfidious
man
that
ever
this
she
confirmed
with
oaths
and
tears
and
a
thousand
endearing
expressions
so
that
establishing
his
heart
in
a
perfect
tranquillity
and
he
leaving
his
writings
and
accounts
with
her
he
told
her
he
was
obliged
to
dine
with
the
advocates
who
had
acted
for
him
in
and
could
not
stay
to
dine
with
her
you
must
know
that
as
soon
as
the
noise
of
old
uncle
s
death
was
noised
about
and
that
he
was
thereupon
fled
they
seized
all
the
estates
both
that
of
the
uncle
and
that
of
as
belonging
to
him
by
right
of
law
but
looking
upon
him
as
his
uncle
s
murderer
they
were
forfeited
to
the
this
part
of
ill
news
kept
from
but
took
order
that
such
a
process
might
be
begun
in
his
name
with
the
that
might
retrieve
it
and
sent
word
if
it
could
not
be
carried
on
by
attornies
for
he
was
not
he
said
in
health
that
nevertheless
he
would
come
into
himself
but
they
being
not
able
to
prove
by
the
witness
of
any
of
or
servants
that
had
any
hand
in
his
death
but
on
the
contrary
all
circumstances
and
the
coroner
s
verdict
brought
it
in
as
a
thing
done
by
accident
and
through
his
own
fault
they
were
obliged
to
release
to
all
his
fortune
with
that
of
his
uncle
which
was
this
day
brought
to
him
by
those
he
was
obliged
to
dine
and
make
up
some
accounts
withal
he
therefore
told
her
he
feared
he
should
be
absent
all
that
afternoon
which
she
was
the
more
pleased
at
because
if
should
return
before
she
had
ordered
the
method
of
their
visit
so
as
not
to
meet
with
each
other
which
was
her
only
contrivance
now
she
should
be
sure
he
would
not
see
or
be
seen
by
who
had
no
sooner
taken
his
leave
but
returns
who
being
now
fully
bent
upon
some
adventure
to
see
if
possible
and
which
intrigue
would
take
up
his
whole
time
to
excuse
his
absence
to
the
jealous
he
feigned
that
he
was
sent
to
by
to
meet
him
upon
the
frontiers
of
and
conduct
him
into
and
that
he
should
be
absent
some
days
this
was
as
could
have
wished
and
after
forcing
herself
to
take
as
kind
a
leave
of
him
as
she
could
whose
head
was
wholly
possessed
with
a
million
of
gold
she
sent
him
away
both
parties
being
very
well
pleased
with
the
artifices
with
which
they
jilted
each
other
at
going
into
his
chair
he
was
seen
by
the
old
count
of
who
cured
perfectly
of
his
wound
was
come
thither
to
seek
in
order
to
take
the
revenge
of
a
man
of
honour
as
he
called
it
which
in
is
the
private
stab
for
private
injuries
and
indeed
more
reasonable
than
base
duelling
where
the
injured
is
as
likely
to
suffer
as
the
injurer
but
durst
not
attack
him
by
in
the
open
street
nor
durst
he
indeed
appear
in
his
own
figure
in
the
king
of
dominions
standing
already
there
convicted
of
the
murder
of
his
first
wife
but
in
a
disguise
came
to
the
chair
with
was
no
sooner
gone
from
the
lodgings
but
he
inquired
of
some
of
the
house
who
lodged
there
that
that
gentleman
came
to
visit
and
they
told
him
a
woman
who
was
a
woman
of
quality
and
a
stranger
this
was
sufficient
you
may
believe
for
him
to
think
it
madam
the
countess
of
with
this
assurance
he
repairs
to
his
lodging
which
was
but
hard
by
and
sets
a
footman
that
attended
him
to
watch
the
return
of
to
those
lodgings
which
he
believed
would
not
be
long
the
footman
who
had
not
seen
only
asked
a
description
of
him
he
told
him
he
was
a
pretty
tall
man
in
black
clothes
for
the
court
was
then
in
mourning
with
long
black
hair
fine
black
eyes
very
handsome
and
well
made
this
was
enough
for
the
lad
he
thought
he
should
know
him
from
a
thousand
by
these
marks
and
tokens
away
goes
the
footman
and
waited
till
the
shutting
in
of
the
evening
and
then
running
to
his
lord
told
him
that
was
come
to
those
lodgings
that
he
saw
him
alight
out
of
the
chair
and
took
perfect
notice
of
him
that
he
was
sure
it
was
that
he
looked
for
overjoyed
that
his
revenge
was
at
hand
took
his
dagger
sword
and
pistol
and
hasted
to
lodgings
where
he
found
the
chair
still
waiting
and
the
doors
all
open
he
made
no
more
ado
but
goes
in
and
ascends
the
stairs
and
passes
on
without
opposition
to
the
very
chamber
where
they
sat
in
the
arms
of
her
lover
not
but
who
being
also
in
black
tall
long
brown
hair
and
handsome
and
by
a
sight
that
might
very
well
deceive
he
made
no
more
to
do
not
doubting
but
it
was
and
but
steps
to
him
and
offering
to
stab
him
was
prevented
by
his
starting
at
the
suddenness
of
his
approach
however
the
dagger
did
not
absolutely
miss
him
but
wounded
him
in
the
left
arm
but
youth
too
nimble
for
age
snatching
at
the
dagger
as
it
wounded
him
at
once
prevented
the
hurt
being
much
and
returned
a
home
blow
at
so
that
he
fell
at
feet
whose
shrieks
alarmed
the
house
to
their
aid
where
they
found
by
the
light
of
the
candle
that
was
brought
that
the
man
was
not
dead
but
lay
gazing
on
who
said
to
him
tell
me
thou
unfortunate
wretch
what
miserable
fate
brought
thee
to
this
place
to
disturb
the
repose
of
those
who
neither
know
thee
nor
had
done
thee
injury
ah
sir
replied
you
have
reason
for
what
you
say
and
i
ask
heaven
that
unknown
lady
and
yourself
a
thousand
pardons
for
my
mistake
and
crime
too
late
i
see
my
error
pity
and
forgive
me
and
let
me
have
a
priest
for
i
believe
i
am
a
dead
was
extremely
moved
with
compassion
at
these
words
and
immediately
sent
his
page
who
was
alarmed
up
in
the
crowd
for
a
father
and
a
surgeon
and
he
declared
before
the
rest
that
he
forgave
that
stranger
meaning
since
he
had
by
a
mistake
of
his
footman
pulled
on
his
own
death
and
had
deserved
it
and
thereupon
as
well
as
he
could
he
told
them
for
whom
he
had
mistaken
who
having
injured
his
honour
he
had
vowed
revenge
upon
and
that
he
took
the
fair
lady
meaning
for
a
faithless
wife
of
his
who
had
been
the
authoress
of
all
this
soon
divined
this
to
be
his
whom
yet
he
had
never
seen
and
stooping
down
to
him
he
cried
it
is
i
sir
that
ought
to
demand
a
thousand
pardons
of
you
for
letting
the
revenge
of
honour
alone
so
wondered
who
he
should
be
that
named
and
asking
him
his
name
he
told
him
he
was
the
unhappy
brother
to
that
fair
wanton
whose
story
was
but
too
well
known
to
him
thus
while
viewing
his
face
found
him
the
very
picture
of
that
false
charmer
while
went
on
and
assured
him
if
it
were
his
unhappiness
to
die
that
he
would
revenge
the
honour
of
him
and
his
sister
on
the
betrayer
of
both
by
this
time
the
surgeon
came
who
found
not
his
wound
to
be
mortal
as
was
feared
and
ventured
to
remove
him
to
his
own
lodgings
whither
would
accompany
him
and
leaving
inclined
after
her
fright
to
be
reposed
he
took
his
leave
of
her
for
that
evening
not
daring
out
of
respect
to
her
to
visit
her
any
more
that
night
he
was
no
sooner
gone
but
who
never
used
to
go
without
two
very
good
about
him
having
left
them
under
his
pillow
last
night
at
lodgings
and
being
upon
he
knew
not
what
occasion
he
might
have
for
them
returned
back
to
her
lodgings
when
he
came
she
was
a
little
surprised
at
first
to
see
him
but
after
reflecting
on
what
revenge
was
threatened
him
she
exposed
secret
to
him
and
told
him
the
whole
adventure
and
how
she
had
got
his
writings
which
would
be
all
her
own
if
she
might
be
suffered
to
manage
the
fond
believer
but
he
whose
thought
ran
on
the
revenge
was
threatened
him
cried
out
he
has
kindly
awakened
me
to
my
duty
by
what
he
threatens
it
is
i
that
ought
to
be
revenged
on
his
perfidy
of
shewing
you
my
letters
and
to
that
end
by
heaven
i
will
defer
all
the
business
in
the
world
to
meet
him
and
pay
his
courtesy
if
i
had
enjoyed
his
sister
he
might
suppose
i
knew
her
not
to
be
so
and
what
man
of
wit
or
youth
would
refuse
a
lovely
woman
that
presents
a
heart
laden
with
love
and
a
person
all
over
charms
to
his
bosom
i
were
to
be
esteemed
unworthy
the
friendship
of
a
man
of
honour
if
i
should
but
he
has
basely
betrayed
me
every
way
makes
love
to
my
celebrated
mistress
whom
he
knows
i
love
and
getting
secrets
unravels
them
to
make
his
court
and
his
access
the
she
foresaw
the
dangerous
consequence
of
a
quarrel
of
this
nature
and
had
no
sooner
blown
the
fire
which
she
did
to
the
end
that
should
avoid
her
lodgings
and
all
places
where
he
might
meet
but
she
hinders
all
her
designs
and
fixing
him
there
he
was
resolved
to
expect
him
at
the
first
place
he
thought
most
likely
to
find
him
in
she
endeavoured
by
a
thousand
entreaties
to
get
him
gone
urging
it
all
for
his
safety
but
that
made
him
the
more
resolved
and
all
she
could
do
could
not
hinder
him
from
staying
supper
and
after
that
from
going
to
bed
so
that
she
was
forced
to
hide
a
thousand
terrors
and
fears
by
feigned
caresses
the
sooner
to
get
him
to
meet
in
the
morning
as
he
said
he
was
to
do
and
though
she
could
not
help
flattering
both
while
by
yet
she
ever
loved
the
absent
best
and
now
repented
a
thousand
times
that
she
had
told
him
any
thing
early
the
next
morning
as
was
his
custom
came
to
inquire
of
health
and
though
he
had
oftentimes
only
inquired
and
no
more
taking
excuse
of
ill
nights
or
commands
that
none
should
come
to
her
till
she
called
and
had
departed
satisfied
and
came
again
yet
now
when
he
went
into
chamber
he
found
she
was
in
a
great
consternation
and
her
looks
and
flattering
excuses
made
him
know
there
was
more
than
usual
in
his
being
denied
he
therefore
pressed
it
the
more
and
she
grew
to
greater
confusion
by
his
pressing
her
at
last
he
demanded
the
key
of
her
lady
s
chamber
he
having
he
said
business
of
great
importance
to
communicate
to
her
she
told
him
she
had
as
great
reason
not
to
deliver
it
that
is
said
she
fearing
she
had
said
too
much
my
lady
s
commands
and
finding
no
persuasion
would
prevail
and
rather
venturing
eternal
displeasure
than
not
to
be
satisfied
in
the
jealousies
she
had
raised
especially
reflecting
on
being
in
town
he
took
in
his
arms
and
forced
the
key
from
her
who
was
willing
to
be
forced
for
she
admired
bounty
and
cared
not
for
being
master
of
the
key
flies
to
door
like
lightning
or
a
jealous
lover
mad
to
discover
what
seen
would
kill
him
he
opens
the
and
goes
softly
to
the
as
if
he
now
feared
to
find
what
he
sought
and
wished
to
heaven
he
might
be
mistaken
he
opened
the
curtains
and
found
sleeping
with
in
her
arms
i
need
make
no
description
of
his
confusion
and
surprise
the
character
i
have
given
of
that
gallant
honest
generous
lover
is
sufficient
to
make
you
imagine
his
heart
when
indeed
he
could
believe
his
eyes
before
he
thought
he
was
about
to
draw
his
sword
and
run
them
both
through
and
revenge
at
once
his
injured
honour
his
love
and
that
of
his
sister
but
that
little
reason
he
had
left
checked
that
barbarity
and
he
was
readier
from
his
own
natural
sweetness
of
disposition
to
run
himself
upon
his
own
sword
and
there
the
christian
pleaded
and
yet
found
his
heart
breaking
his
whole
body
trembling
his
mind
all
agony
his
cheeks
cold
and
pale
his
eyes
languishing
his
tongue
refusing
to
give
utterance
to
his
pressure
and
his
legs
to
support
his
body
and
much
ado
he
had
to
reel
into
chamber
where
he
found
the
maid
dying
with
grief
for
her
concern
for
him
he
was
no
sooner
got
to
her
but
he
fell
dead
upon
it
while
she
who
was
afraid
to
alarm
her
lady
and
lest
being
found
there
had
accused
her
with
betraying
them
but
shutting
the
door
close
for
yet
no
body
had
seen
him
but
herself
she
endeavoured
all
she
could
to
bring
him
to
life
again
and
it
was
a
great
while
before
she
could
do
so
as
soon
as
he
was
recovered
he
lay
a
good
while
without
speaking
reflecting
on
his
fate
but
after
appearing
as
if
he
had
assumed
all
his
manly
spirits
together
he
rose
up
and
conjured
to
say
nothing
of
what
had
happened
and
that
she
should
not
repent
the
service
she
would
do
him
by
it
who
was
his
absolute
devoted
slave
promised
him
all
he
desired
and
he
had
the
courage
to
go
once
again
to
confirm
himself
in
the
lewdness
of
this
undone
fair
one
whose
perjuries
had
rendered
her
even
odious
now
to
him
and
he
beheld
her
with
scorn
and
disdain
and
that
she
might
know
how
indifferently
he
did
so
when
she
should
come
to
know
it
he
took
sword
that
lay
on
her
and
left
his
own
in
the
place
and
went
out
pleased
at
least
in
this
that
he
had
commanded
his
passion
in
the
midst
of
the
most
powerful
occasion
for
madness
and
revenge
that
ever
was
they
lay
thus
secured
in
each
other
s
arms
till
nine
o
clock
in
the
morning
when
received
a
note
from
who
was
managing
his
lord
s
design
of
getting
a
billet
delivered
to
by
the
way
of
a
nun
whom
had
made
some
address
to
to
that
end
and
sent
to
beg
his
lord
would
come
to
the
grate
and
speak
to
the
young
nun
who
had
undertaken
for
any
innocent
message
this
note
made
him
rise
and
haste
to
go
out
when
he
received
another
from
an
unknown
hand
which
was
thus
philander
my
lord
i
have
important
business
with
you
and
beg
i
may
speak
with
you
at
three
of
the
clock
i
will
wait
for
you
by
the
fountain
in
the
park
yours
who
was
impatient
to
have
him
gone
never
asked
to
see
either
of
these
notes
lest
it
should
have
deterred
him
and
she
knew
would
visit
her
early
though
she
knew
withal
she
could
refuse
him
entrance
with
any
slight
excuse
so
good
an
opinion
he
had
of
her
virtue
and
so
absolute
an
ascendant
she
had
over
she
had
given
orders
if
he
came
to
be
refused
her
chamber
and
she
was
glad
to
know
he
had
not
yet
been
at
her
lodgings
a
hundred
times
she
was
about
to
make
use
of
the
lessened
love
had
for
her
and
to
have
proposed
to
him
the
suffering
to
share
her
embraces
for
so
good
an
interest
since
no
returns
could
be
had
from
nor
any
signs
of
amendment
of
their
fortunes
any
other
way
but
still
she
feared
he
had
too
much
honour
to
permit
such
a
cheat
in
love
to
be
put
even
upon
an
enemy
this
fear
deferred
her
speaking
of
it
or
offering
to
sacrifice
as
a
cully
to
their
interest
though
she
wished
it
nor
knew
she
long
how
to
deceive
both
the
business
was
to
put
off
handsomely
if
possible
since
she
failed
of
all
other
hopes
these
were
her
thoughts
while
was
dressing
and
raised
by
his
asking
for
some
more
pistoles
from
her
cabinet
which
she
found
would
quickly
be
at
an
end
if
one
lover
diminished
daily
and
the
other
was
hindered
from
increasing
but
was
no
sooner
dressed
but
he
left
her
to
her
repose
and
who
had
a
attending
the
motions
of
all
that
morning
and
had
brought
him
word
he
was
gone
from
went
to
visit
her
and
entering
her
chamber
all
changed
from
what
he
was
before
and
death
sat
in
his
face
and
eyes
maugre
all
his
resolves
and
art
of
dissembling
she
not
perceiving
it
as
she
lay
stretched
out
her
arms
to
receive
him
with
her
wonted
caresses
but
he
gently
put
her
off
and
sighing
cried
no
i
leave
those
joys
to
happier
she
was
a
little
surprised
at
that
but
not
imagining
he
had
known
her
guilt
replied
then
those
caresses
were
only
meant
for
him
for
if
could
make
him
happy
he
was
sure
of
being
the
man
and
by
force
compelled
him
to
suffer
her
kisses
and
embraces
while
his
heart
was
bursting
without
any
sense
of
the
pleasure
of
her
touches
ah
says
he
i
can
never
think
myself
secure
or
happy
while
is
so
near
you
every
absent
moment
alarms
me
with
ten
thousand
fears
in
sleep
i
dream
thou
art
false
and
givest
thy
honour
up
all
my
absent
nights
and
all
day
thy
vows
and
that
he
was
sure
should
she
again
suffer
herself
to
see
he
should
be
abandoned
and
she
again
undone
for
since
i
parted
with
you
continued
he
i
heard
from
that
he
saw
yesterday
come
out
of
your
lodgings
how
can
i
bear
this
when
you
have
vowed
not
to
see
him
with
imprecations
that
must
damn
thee
without
severe
repentance
at
this
she
offered
to
swear
again
but
he
stopped
her
and
begged
her
not
to
swear
till
she
had
well
considered
then
she
confessed
he
made
her
a
visit
but
that
she
used
him
with
that
pride
and
scorn
that
if
he
were
a
man
of
honour
he
could
never
bear
and
she
was
sure
he
would
trouble
her
no
more
in
fine
she
flattered
fawned
and
jilted
so
as
no
woman
common
in
the
trade
of
sinful
love
could
be
so
great
a
mistress
of
the
art
he
suffered
her
to
go
on
in
all
that
could
confirm
him
she
thought
him
an
errant
coxcomb
and
all
that
could
render
her
the
most
contemptible
of
her
sex
he
was
pleased
because
it
made
him
despise
her
and
that
was
easier
than
adoring
her
yet
though
he
heard
her
with
scorn
he
heard
her
with
too
much
love
when
she
was
even
breathless
with
eager
prostitution
he
cried
ah
indiscreet
and
unadvised
how
i
pity
thee
ah
said
she
observing
him
speak
this
with
a
scornful
smile
is
it
possible
you
should
indeed
be
offended
for
a
simple
visit
which
neither
was
by
my
invitation
or
wish
can
you
be
angry
if
i
treat
with
the
civility
of
a
brother
or
rather
that
i
suffer
him
to
see
me
to
receive
my
reproaches
stop
here
said
he
thou
fair
deluding
flatterer
or
thou
art
for
ever
ruined
do
not
charge
thy
soul
yet
farther
do
not
delude
me
on
all
yet
i
can
forgive
as
i
am
dying
but
should
i
live
i
could
not
promise
thee
add
not
new
crimes
by
cozening
me
anew
for
i
shall
find
out
truth
though
it
lie
hid
even
in
the
bottom
of
this
he
spoke
with
an
air
of
fierceness
which
seeing
her
grow
pale
upon
he
sunk
again
to
compassion
and
in
a
soft
voice
cried
whatever
injuries
thou
hast
done
my
honour
thy
word
and
faith
to
me
and
my
poor
heart
i
can
perhaps
forgive
when
you
dare
utter
truth
there
is
some
honesty
in
that
she
once
more
embracing
him
fell
anew
to
protesting
her
ill
treatment
of
how
she
gave
him
back
his
vows
and
assured
him
she
would
never
be
reconciled
to
him
and
did
you
part
so
replied
the
dying
upon
my
honour
said
she
did
you
not
kiss
at
parting
said
he
just
kissed
as
friends
no
more
by
all
thy
at
this
he
bursts
into
tears
and
cried
oh
why
when
i
reposed
my
heart
with
thee
and
lavished
out
my
very
soul
in
love
could
i
not
merit
this
poor
recompense
of
being
fairly
dealt
with
behold
this
sword
i
took
it
from
your
view
it
it
is
myself
this
morning
took
it
from
your
table
no
more
since
you
may
guess
the
fatal
rest
i
am
undone
and
i
am
satisfied
i
had
a
thousand
warnings
of
my
fate
but
still
the
beauty
charmed
and
my
too
good
nature
yielded
oft
you
have
cozened
me
and
oft
i
saw
it
and
still
love
made
me
willing
to
forgive
the
foolish
passion
hung
upon
my
soul
and
soothed
me
into
quite
confounded
not
so
much
with
the
knowledge
he
had
of
the
unlucky
adventure
as
at
her
so
earnestly
denying
and
forswearing
any
love
had
passed
between
them
lay
still
to
consider
how
to
retrieve
this
lost
game
and
gave
him
leisure
to
go
on
now
said
he
thou
art
silent
would
thou
hadst
still
been
so
ah
hapless
maid
who
hast
this
fate
attending
thee
to
ruin
all
that
love
thee
be
dumb
be
dumb
for
ever
let
the
false
charm
that
dwells
upon
thy
tongue
be
ended
with
my
life
let
it
no
more
undo
believing
man
lest
amongst
the
number
some
one
may
conquer
thee
and
deaf
to
all
thy
wit
and
blind
to
beauty
in
some
mad
passion
think
of
all
thy
cozenings
should
fall
upon
thee
and
forget
thy
sex
and
by
thy
death
revenge
the
lost
at
these
words
he
would
have
rose
from
her
arms
but
she
detained
him
and
with
a
piteous
voice
implored
his
pardon
but
he
calmly
replied
yes
i
will
pardon
thee
and
wish
that
heaven
may
do
so
to
whom
apply
thy
early
rhetoric
and
penitence
for
it
can
never
never
charm
me
more
my
fortune
if
thou
ever
wanted
support
to
keep
thee
chaste
and
virtuous
shall
still
be
commanded
by
thee
with
that
usual
frankness
it
has
hitherto
served
thee
but
for
he
is
resolved
to
go
where
he
will
never
more
be
seen
by
woman
or
hear
the
name
of
love
to
ought
but
heaven
farewell
one
parting
kiss
and
then
a
long
farewell
as
he
bowed
to
kiss
her
she
caught
him
fast
in
her
arms
while
a
flood
of
tears
bathed
his
face
nor
could
he
prevent
his
from
mixing
with
hers
while
thus
they
lay
came
into
the
room
and
finding
them
so
closely
entwined
he
was
as
much
surprised
almost
as
was
before
and
drawing
his
sword
was
about
to
have
killed
him
but
his
honour
overcame
his
passion
and
he
would
not
take
him
at
such
disadvantage
but
with
the
flat
of
his
sword
striking
him
on
the
back
as
he
lay
he
cried
rise
traitor
and
turn
to
thy
mortal
not
at
all
surprised
turned
his
head
and
his
eyes
bedewed
in
tears
towards
his
rival
if
thou
be
est
an
enemy
said
he
never
couldst
have
taken
me
in
a
better
humour
of
dying
finish
that
life
then
which
if
you
spare
it
will
possibly
never
leave
thine
in
repose
the
injuries
you
have
done
me
being
too
great
to
be
and
is
it
thus
replied
thus
with
my
mistress
that
you
would
revenge
them
is
it
in
the
arms
of
that
you
would
repay
me
the
favours
i
did
your
sister
you
have
by
that
word
said
reproached
my
and
leaping
briskly
from
the
bed
he
took
out
his
sword
and
cried
come
then
let
us
go
where
we
may
repair
both
our
losses
since
ladies
chambers
are
not
fit
places
to
adjust
debts
of
this
nature
at
these
words
they
both
went
down
stairs
and
it
was
in
vain
called
and
cried
out
to
conjure
them
to
come
back
her
power
of
commanding
she
had
in
one
unlucky
day
lost
over
both
those
gallant
lovers
and
both
left
her
with
pity
to
say
no
worse
of
the
effect
of
her
ill
conduct
went
directly
to
the
park
to
the
place
whither
he
before
had
challenged
who
lost
no
time
but
followed
him
as
soon
as
he
was
come
to
the
fountain
he
drew
and
told
that
was
the
place
whither
he
invited
him
in
his
billet
that
morning
however
if
he
liked
not
the
ground
he
was
ready
to
remove
to
any
other
was
a
little
surprised
to
find
that
invitation
was
a
challenge
and
that
should
be
beforehand
with
him
upon
the
score
of
revenge
and
replied
sir
if
the
billet
came
from
you
it
was
a
favour
i
thank
you
for
since
it
kindly
put
me
in
mind
of
that
revenge
i
ought
so
justly
to
take
of
you
for
betraying
the
secrets
of
friendship
i
reposed
in
you
and
making
base
advantages
of
them
to
recommend
yourself
to
a
woman
you
knew
i
loved
and
who
hates
you
in
spite
of
all
the
ungenerous
ways
you
have
taken
to
gain
sir
replied
i
confess
with
a
blush
and
infinite
shame
the
error
with
which
you
accuse
me
and
have
nothing
to
defend
so
great
a
perfidy
to
tell
you
i
was
wrought
out
of
it
by
the
greatest
cunning
imaginable
and
that
i
must
have
seen
die
at
my
feet
if
i
had
refused
them
is
not
excuse
enough
for
the
breach
of
that
friendship
no
though
i
were
exasperated
with
the
relation
there
of
my
sister
s
dishonour
i
must
therefore
adjust
that
debt
with
you
as
well
as
i
can
and
if
i
die
in
the
juster
quarrel
of
my
sister
s
honour
i
shall
believe
it
the
vengeance
of
heaven
upon
me
for
that
one
breach
of
sir
replied
you
have
given
me
so
great
a
satisfaction
in
this
confession
and
have
made
so
good
and
gallant
an
atonement
by
this
acknowledgement
that
it
is
with
relunctancy
i
go
to
punish
you
for
other
injuries
of
which
i
am
assured
you
can
not
so
well
acquit
though
i
would
not
justify
a
baseness
replied
for
which
there
ought
to
be
no
excuse
yet
i
will
not
accuse
myself
or
acknowledge
other
injuries
but
leave
you
something
to
maintain
the
quarrel
on
and
render
it
a
little
just
on
your
side
nor
go
to
wipe
off
the
outrage
you
pretend
i
have
done
your
love
by
adoring
the
fair
person
who
at
least
has
been
dear
to
you
by
the
wrongs
you
have
done
my
come
sir
we
shall
not
by
disputing
quit
scores
cried
a
little
impatiently
what
i
have
lately
seen
has
made
my
rage
too
brisk
for
long
at
that
they
both
advanced
and
made
about
twenty
passes
before
either
received
any
wound
the
first
that
bled
was
who
received
a
wound
in
his
breast
which
he
returned
on
and
after
that
many
were
given
and
taken
so
that
the
track
their
feet
made
in
following
and
advancing
as
they
fought
was
marked
out
by
their
blood
in
this
condition
still
fighting
who
had
called
them
back
in
vain
and
only
in
her
in
a
chair
pursued
them
that
minute
they
quitted
her
chamber
found
them
thus
employed
and
without
any
fear
she
threw
herself
between
them
out
of
respect
to
her
ceased
but
as
if
he
had
not
regarded
her
would
still
have
been
striving
for
victory
when
she
stayed
his
hand
and
begged
him
to
hear
her
he
then
set
the
point
of
his
sword
to
the
ground
and
breathless
and
fainting
almost
attended
what
she
had
to
say
she
conjured
him
to
cease
the
quarrel
and
told
him
if
had
injured
him
in
her
heart
he
ought
to
remember
he
had
injured
as
much
in
that
of
his
sister
she
conjured
him
by
all
the
friendship
both
she
and
himself
had
received
at
hands
and
concluded
with
saying
so
many
fine
things
of
that
cavalier
that
in
lieu
of
appeasing
it
but
the
more
exasperated
the
jealous
who
took
new
courage
with
new
breath
and
passed
at
she
then
addressed
to
and
cried
hold
oh
hold
or
make
your
way
through
me
for
here
i
will
defend
virtue
and
honour
and
put
herself
before
she
spoke
with
so
piteous
a
voice
and
pleaded
with
so
much
tenderness
that
laying
his
sword
at
her
feet
bid
her
dispose
false
as
she
was
of
his
honour
for
oh
said
he
my
life
is
already
fallen
a
victim
to
your
perjuries
he
could
say
no
more
but
falling
where
he
had
laid
his
sword
left
master
of
the
field
by
this
time
some
gentlemen
that
had
been
walking
came
up
to
them
and
found
a
man
lie
dead
and
a
lady
imploring
another
to
fly
they
looked
on
and
found
he
had
yet
life
and
immediately
sent
for
surgeons
who
carried
him
to
his
lodgings
with
very
little
hope
as
well
as
his
wounds
would
give
him
leave
got
into
a
chair
telling
the
gentlemen
that
looked
on
him
he
would
be
responsible
for
life
if
he
had
had
the
ill
fortune
to
take
it
that
his
quarrel
was
too
just
to
suffer
him
to
so
being
carried
to
the
with
an
absolute
command
to
not
to
follow
him
or
visit
him
for
fear
of
hurting
him
by
disobeying
she
suffered
herself
to
be
carried
to
her
lodgings
where
she
threw
herself
on
her
bed
and
drowned
her
fair
eyes
in
a
shower
of
tears
she
advises
with
and
her
page
what
to
do
in
this
extremity
she
fears
she
has
by
her
ill
management
lost
both
her
lovers
and
she
was
in
a
condition
of
needing
every
aid
they
who
knew
the
excellent
temper
of
and
knew
him
to
be
the
most
considerable
lover
of
the
two
besought
her
as
the
best
expedient
she
could
have
recourse
to
to
visit
who
could
not
but
take
it
kindly
and
they
did
not
doubt
but
she
had
so
absolute
a
power
over
him
that
with
a
very
little
complaisance
towards
him
she
would
retrieve
that
heart
her
ill
luck
had
this
morning
forfeited
and
which
they
protested
they
knew
nothing
of
nor
how
he
got
into
her
chamber
this
advice
she
took
but
because
was
carried
away
dead
she
feared
and
swooned
with
the
fear
that
he
was
no
longer
in
the
world
or
at
least
that
he
would
not
long
be
so
however
she
assumed
her
courage
again
at
the
thought
that
if
he
did
die
she
had
an
absolute
possession
of
all
his
fortune
which
was
to
her
the
most
considerable
part
of
the
man
or
at
least
what
rendered
him
so
very
agreeable
to
her
however
she
thought
fit
to
send
her
page
which
she
did
in
an
hour
after
he
was
carried
home
to
see
how
he
did
who
brought
her
word
that
he
was
revived
to
life
and
had
commanded
his
gentleman
to
receive
no
messages
from
her
this
was
all
she
could
learn
and
what
put
her
into
the
greatest
extremity
of
grief
she
after
sent
to
and
found
him
much
the
better
of
the
two
but
most
infinitely
incensed
against
this
also
added
to
her
despair
yet
since
she
found
she
had
not
a
heart
that
any
love
or
loss
of
honour
or
fortune
could
break
but
on
the
contrary
a
rest
of
youth
and
beauty
that
might
oblige
her
with
some
reason
to
look
forward
on
new
lovers
if
the
old
must
depart
the
next
thing
she
resolved
was
to
do
her
utmost
endeavour
to
retrieve
which
if
unattainable
she
would
make
the
best
of
her
youth
she
sent
therefore
notwithstanding
his
commands
to
suffer
none
of
her
people
to
come
and
see
him
to
inquire
of
his
health
and
in
four
days
finding
he
received
other
visits
she
dressed
herself
with
all
the
advantages
of
her
sex
and
in
a
chair
was
carried
to
his
aunt
s
where
he
lay
the
good
lady
not
knowing
but
she
might
be
that
person
of
quality
whom
she
knew
to
be
extremely
in
love
with
her
nephew
and
who
lived
at
the
court
of
and
was
niece
to
the
governor
carried
her
to
his
chamber
where
she
left
her
as
not
willing
to
be
a
witness
of
a
visit
she
knew
must
be
supposed
it
was
evening
and
was
in
bed
and
at
the
first
sight
of
her
his
blood
grew
disordered
in
his
veins
flushed
in
his
pale
face
and
burnt
all
over
his
body
and
he
was
near
to
swooning
as
he
lay
she
approached
his
bed
with
a
face
all
set
for
languishment
love
and
shame
in
her
eyes
and
sighs
that
without
speaking
seemed
to
tell
her
grief
at
his
disaster
she
sat
or
rather
fell
on
his
bed
as
unable
to
support
the
sight
of
him
in
that
condition
she
in
a
soft
manner
seized
his
burning
hand
grasped
it
and
sighed
then
put
it
to
her
mouth
and
suffered
a
tear
or
two
to
fall
upon
it
and
when
she
would
have
spoke
she
made
her
sobs
resist
her
words
and
left
nothing
unacted
that
might
move
the
to
that
degree
of
passion
she
wished
a
hundred
times
fain
he
would
have
spoke
but
still
his
rising
passion
choked
his
words
and
still
he
feared
they
would
prove
either
too
soft
and
kind
for
the
injuries
he
had
received
or
too
rough
and
cold
for
so
delicate
and
charming
a
creature
and
one
whom
in
spite
of
all
those
injuries
he
still
adored
she
appeared
before
him
with
those
attractions
that
never
failed
to
conquer
him
with
that
submission
and
pleading
in
her
modest
bashful
eyes
that
even
gave
his
the
lie
who
had
seen
her
perfidy
oh
what
should
he
do
to
keep
that
fire
from
breaking
forth
with
violence
which
she
had
so
thoroughly
kindled
in
his
heart
how
should
that
excellent
good
nature
assume
an
unwonted
sullenness
only
to
appear
what
it
could
not
by
nature
be
he
was
all
soft
and
sweet
and
if
he
had
pride
he
knew
also
how
to
make
his
pleasure
and
his
youth
loved
love
above
all
the
other
little
vanities
that
attend
it
and
was
the
most
proper
to
it
fain
he
would
palliate
her
crime
and
considers
in
the
condition
she
was
she
could
not
but
have
some
tenderness
for
that
it
was
no
more
than
what
before
passed
it
was
no
new
lover
that
came
to
kindle
new
passions
or
approach
her
with
a
new
flame
but
a
decliner
who
came
and
was
received
with
the
dregs
of
love
with
all
the
cold
indifference
imaginable
this
he
would
have
persuaded
himself
but
dares
not
till
he
hears
her
speak
and
yet
fears
she
should
not
speak
his
sense
and
this
fear
makes
him
sighing
break
silence
and
he
cried
in
a
soft
tone
ah
why
too
lovely
fair
why
do
you
come
to
trouble
the
repose
of
my
dying
hours
will
you
cruel
maid
pursue
me
to
my
grave
shall
i
not
have
one
lone
hour
to
ask
forgiveness
of
heaven
for
my
sin
of
loving
thee
the
greatest
that
ever
loaded
my
youth
and
yet
alas
the
least
repented
yet
be
kind
and
trouble
not
my
solitude
depart
with
all
the
trophies
of
my
ruin
and
if
they
can
add
any
glory
to
thy
future
life
boast
them
all
over
the
universe
and
tell
what
a
deluded
youth
thou
hast
undone
take
take
fair
deceiver
all
my
industry
my
right
of
my
birth
my
thriving
parents
have
been
so
long
to
make
me
happy
with
take
the
useless
trifle
and
lavish
it
on
pleasure
to
make
thee
gay
and
fit
for
luckier
lovers
take
that
best
part
of
me
and
let
this
worst
alone
it
was
that
first
won
the
dear
confession
from
thee
that
drew
my
ruin
on
for
which
i
hate
it
and
wish
myself
born
a
poor
cottage
boor
where
i
might
never
have
seen
thy
tempting
beauty
but
lived
for
ever
blessed
in
at
this
the
tears
ran
from
his
eyes
with
which
the
softened
mixed
her
welcome
stream
and
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
she
replied
with
half
cunning
and
half
love
for
still
there
was
too
much
of
the
first
mingled
with
the
last
oh
my
to
what
extremities
are
you
resolved
to
drive
a
poor
unfortunate
who
even
in
the
height
of
youth
and
some
small
stock
of
beauty
am
reduced
to
all
the
miseries
of
the
wretched
far
from
my
noble
noble
parents
lost
to
honour
and
abandoned
by
my
friends
a
helpless
wanderer
in
a
strange
land
exposed
to
want
and
perishing
and
had
no
sanctuary
but
thyself
thy
dear
thy
precious
self
whom
heaven
had
sent
in
mercy
to
my
aid
and
thou
at
last
by
a
mistaken
turn
of
miserable
fate
hast
taken
that
dear
aid
at
this
she
fell
weeping
on
his
panting
bosom
nevertheless
he
got
the
courage
to
reply
once
again
before
he
yielded
himself
a
shameful
victim
to
her
flattery
and
said
cruel
is
it
possible
that
you
can
charge
the
levity
on
me
is
it
i
have
taken
this
poor
aid
as
you
are
pleased
to
call
it
from
you
oh
rather
blame
your
own
unhappy
easiness
that
after
having
sworn
me
faith
and
love
could
violate
them
both
both
where
there
was
no
need
it
would
have
better
become
thy
pride
and
quality
to
have
resented
injuries
received
than
brought
again
that
scorned
abandoned
person
fine
as
it
was
and
shining
still
with
youth
to
his
forgetful
alas
said
she
i
will
not
justify
my
hateful
crime
a
crime
i
loathe
to
think
of
it
was
a
fault
beyond
a
prostitution
there
might
have
possibly
been
new
joy
in
such
a
sin
but
here
it
was
palled
and
gone
fled
to
eternity
away
and
but
for
the
dear
cause
i
did
commit
it
there
were
no
expiation
for
my
fault
no
penitent
tears
could
wash
away
my
alas
said
he
if
there
were
any
cause
if
there
be
any
possible
excuse
for
such
a
breach
of
love
give
it
my
heart
make
me
believe
it
and
i
may
yet
live
and
though
i
can
not
think
thee
innocent
to
be
compelled
by
any
frivolous
reason
it
would
greatly
satisfy
my
longing
soul
but
have
a
care
do
not
delude
me
on
for
if
thou
durst
persuade
me
into
pardon
and
to
return
to
all
my
native
fondness
and
then
again
shouldst
play
me
fast
and
loose
by
heaven
by
all
my
sacred
passion
to
thee
by
all
that
men
call
holy
i
will
pursue
thee
with
my
utmost
hate
forsake
thee
with
my
fortune
and
my
heart
and
leave
thee
wretched
to
the
scorning
crowd
pardon
these
rude
expressions
of
a
love
that
can
hardly
forgive
the
words
it
utters
i
blush
with
shame
while
i
pronounce
them
when
she
replied
may
all
you
have
pronounced
and
all
your
injured
love
can
invent
fall
on
me
when
i
ever
more
deceive
you
believe
me
now
and
but
forgive
what
is
past
and
trust
my
love
and
honour
for
the
at
this
she
told
him
that
in
the
first
visit
made
her
she
using
him
so
reproachfully
and
upbraiding
him
with
his
inconstancy
made
him
understand
that
he
was
betrayed
by
and
that
the
whole
intrigue
with
confessed
by
him
was
discovered
to
which
he
said
put
him
into
so
violent
a
rage
against
that
he
vowed
that
minute
to
find
him
out
and
kill
him
nor
could
all
the
persuasions
of
reason
serve
to
hinder
him
so
that
she
who
as
she
said
loved
to
death
finding
so
powerful
an
enemy
as
her
fears
made
her
fancy
was
ready
to
have
snatched
from
her
in
one
furious
moment
all
she
adored
she
had
recourse
to
all
the
flattery
of
love
to
him
from
an
attempt
so
dangerous
and
it
was
with
much
ado
with
all
those
aids
that
he
was
obliged
to
stay
which
she
had
forced
him
to
do
to
get
time
to
give
him
notice
in
the
morning
for
his
approaching
danger
not
that
she
feared
life
had
attacked
it
fairly
but
he
looked
on
himself
as
a
person
injured
by
close
private
ways
and
would
take
a
like
revenge
and
have
hurt
him
when
he
as
little
dreamed
of
it
as
did
of
the
discovery
he
made
of
his
letter
to
her
to
this
she
swore
she
wept
she
embraced
and
still
protested
it
true
adding
withal
a
thousand
protestations
of
her
future
detestation
of
him
and
that
since
the
worst
was
past
and
that
they
had
fought
and
he
was
come
off
though
with
so
many
wounds
yet
with
life
she
was
resolved
utterly
to
defy
as
the
most
perfidious
of
his
sex
and
assured
him
that
nothing
in
the
world
was
so
indifferent
as
she
in
his
arms
in
fine
after
having
omitted
nothing
that
might
gain
a
credit
and
assure
him
of
her
love
and
heart
and
possess
him
with
a
belief
for
the
future
of
her
lasting
vows
he
wholly
convinced
and
overcome
snatches
her
in
his
arms
and
bursting
into
a
shower
of
tears
cried
take
take
all
my
soul
thou
lovely
charmer
of
it
and
dispose
of
the
destiny
of
and
smothering
her
with
kisses
and
embraces
made
a
perfect
reconciliation
when
the
surgeons
who
came
to
visit
him
finding
him
in
the
disorder
of
a
fever
though
more
joy
was
triumphing
in
his
face
than
before
they
imagined
this
lady
the
fair
person
for
whom
this
quarrel
was
for
it
had
made
a
great
noise
you
may
believe
and
finding
it
hurtful
for
his
wounds
either
to
be
transported
with
too
much
rage
grief
or
love
besought
him
he
would
not
talk
too
much
or
suffer
any
visits
that
might
prejudice
his
health
and
indeed
with
what
had
been
past
he
found
himself
after
his
transport
very
ill
and
feverish
so
that
promised
the
doctors
she
would
visit
him
no
more
in
a
day
or
two
though
she
knew
not
well
how
to
be
from
him
so
long
but
would
content
herself
with
sending
her
page
to
inquire
of
his
health
to
this
made
very
great
opposition
but
his
aunt
and
the
rest
of
the
learned
were
of
opinion
it
ought
for
his
health
to
be
so
and
he
was
obliged
to
be
satisfied
with
her
absence
at
parting
she
came
to
him
and
again
besought
him
to
believe
her
vows
to
be
well
and
that
she
would
depart
somewhere
with
him
far
from
who
she
knew
was
obliged
to
attend
the
motions
of
at
whom
again
she
imprecated
never
to
see
more
this
satisfied
our
impatient
lover
and
he
suffered
her
to
go
and
leave
him
to
that
rest
he
could
get
she
was
no
sooner
got
home
and
retired
to
her
chamber
but
finding
herself
alone
which
now
she
did
not
care
to
be
and
being
assured
she
should
not
see
instead
of
triumphing
for
her
victory
she
sent
her
page
to
inquire
again
of
health
and
to
entreat
that
she
might
visit
him
at
first
before
she
sent
she
checked
this
thought
as
base
as
against
all
honour
and
all
her
vows
and
promises
to
the
brave
but
finding
an
inclination
to
it
and
proposing
a
pleasure
and
satisfaction
in
it
she
was
of
a
nature
not
to
lose
a
pleasure
for
a
little
punctilio
of
honour
and
without
considering
what
would
be
the
event
of
such
a
folly
she
sent
her
page
though
he
had
been
repulsed
before
and
forbid
coming
with
any
messages
from
his
lady
the
page
found
no
better
success
than
hitherto
he
had
done
but
being
with
much
entreaty
brought
to
chamber
he
found
him
sitting
in
his
to
whom
addressing
himself
he
had
no
sooner
named
his
lady
but
bid
him
be
gone
for
he
would
hear
nothing
from
that
false
woman
the
boy
would
have
replied
but
he
grew
more
enraged
and
reviling
her
with
all
the
railings
of
incensed
lovers
he
puts
himself
into
his
closet
without
speaking
any
more
or
suffering
any
answer
this
message
being
delivered
to
the
expecting
lady
put
her
into
a
very
great
rage
which
ended
in
as
deep
a
concern
her
great
pride
fortified
by
her
made
her
highly
resent
the
affront
and
she
believed
it
more
to
the
glory
of
her
beauty
to
have
quitted
a
hundred
lovers
than
to
be
abandoned
by
one
it
was
this
that
made
her
rave
and
tear
and
talk
high
and
after
all
to
use
her
cunning
to
retrieve
what
it
had
been
most
happy
for
her
should
have
been
for
ever
lost
and
she
ought
to
have
blessed
the
occasion
but
her
malicious
star
had
designed
other
fortune
for
her
she
wrote
to
him
several
letters
that
were
sent
back
sealed
she
railed
she
upbraided
and
then
fell
to
submission
at
last
he
was
persuaded
to
open
one
but
returned
such
answers
as
gave
her
no
satisfaction
but
encouraged
her
with
a
little
hope
that
she
should
draw
him
on
to
a
reconciliation
between
whiles
she
failed
not
to
send
the
kindest
impatient
letters
in
the
world
and
received
the
softest
replies
that
the
tongue
of
man
could
utter
for
he
could
not
write
yet
at
last
having
reduced
to
the
very
brink
of
despair
and
finding
by
her
passionate
importunity
that
he
could
make
his
peace
with
her
on
any
terms
of
advantage
to
himself
resolved
to
draw
such
articles
of
agreement
as
should
wholly
subdue
her
to
him
or
to
stand
it
out
to
the
last
the
conditions
were
that
he
being
a
person
by
no
means
of
a
humour
to
be
imposed
upon
if
he
were
dear
to
her
she
should
give
herself
entirely
to
his
possession
and
quit
the
very
conversation
of
all
those
he
had
but
an
apprehension
would
disturb
his
repose
that
she
should
remove
out
of
the
way
of
his
troublesome
rivals
and
suffer
herself
to
be
conducted
whither
he
thought
good
to
carry
her
these
conditions
she
liked
all
but
the
going
away
she
could
not
tell
to
what
sort
of
confinement
that
might
amount
he
flies
off
wholly
and
denies
all
treaty
upon
her
least
scruple
and
will
not
be
asked
the
explanation
of
what
he
has
proposed
so
that
she
bends
like
a
slave
for
a
little
empire
over
him
and
to
purchase
the
vanity
of
retaining
him
suffers
herself
to
be
absolutely
undone
she
submits
and
that
very
day
she
had
leave
from
the
doctors
to
visit
and
that
lover
lay
panting
in
expectation
of
the
blessed
sight
believing
every
minute
an
age
his
apartment
dressed
and
perfumed
and
all
things
ready
to
receive
the
darling
of
his
soul
came
in
a
coach
and
six
horses
and
making
her
pack
up
all
her
jewels
and
fine
things
and
what
they
could
not
carry
in
the
coach
put
up
to
come
after
them
and
hurries
her
to
a
little
town
in
a
place
between
flanders
and
germany
without
giving
her
time
to
write
or
letting
her
know
whither
she
was
going
while
she
was
putting
up
her
things
i
know
she
has
since
confessed
her
heart
trembled
and
foreboded
the
ill
that
was
to
come
that
is
that
she
was
hastening
to
ruin
but
she
had
chanced
to
say
so
much
to
him
of
her
passion
to
retrieve
him
that
she
was
ashamed
to
own
the
contrary
so
soon
but
suffered
that
force
upon
her
inclinations
to
do
the
most
dishonourable
and
disinterested
thing
in
the
world
she
had
not
been
there
a
week
and
her
trunks
of
plate
and
fine
things
were
arrived
but
she
fell
in
labour
and
was
brought
to
bed
though
she
shewed
very
little
of
her
condition
all
the
time
she
went
this
great
affair
being
well
over
she
considers
herself
a
new
woman
and
began
or
rather
continued
to
consider
the
advantage
she
had
lost
in
she
regrets
extremely
her
conduct
and
from
one
degree
to
another
she
looks
on
herself
as
lost
to
him
she
every
day
saw
what
she
had
decayed
her
jewels
sold
one
by
one
and
at
last
her
necessaries
whose
head
was
running
on
grudged
every
moment
he
was
not
about
that
affair
and
grew
as
peevish
as
she
she
recovers
to
new
beauty
but
he
grows
colder
and
colder
by
possession
love
decayed
and
ill
humour
increased
they
grew
uneasy
on
both
sides
and
not
a
day
passed
wherein
they
did
not
break
into
open
and
violent
quarrels
upbraiding
each
other
with
those
faults
which
both
wished
that
either
would
again
commit
that
they
might
be
fairly
rid
of
one
another
it
grew
at
last
to
that
height
that
they
were
never
well
but
when
they
were
absent
from
one
another
he
making
a
hundred
little
intrigues
and
gallantries
with
all
the
pretty
women
and
those
of
any
quality
in
the
town
or
neighbouring
she
saw
this
with
grief
shame
and
disdain
and
could
not
tell
which
way
to
relieve
herself
she
was
not
permitted
the
privilege
of
visits
unless
to
some
grave
ladies
or
to
monasteries
a
man
was
a
rarity
she
had
hardly
seen
in
two
months
which
was
the
time
she
had
been
there
so
that
she
had
leisure
to
think
of
her
folly
bemoan
the
effects
of
her
injustice
and
contrive
if
she
could
to
remedy
her
disagreeable
life
which
now
was
reduced
not
only
to
scurrilous
quarrels
and
hard
words
but
often
in
her
fury
she
flying
upon
him
and
with
the
courage
or
indiscretion
of
her
sex
would
provoke
him
to
indecencies
that
render
life
insupportable
on
both
sides
while
they
lived
at
this
rate
both
contriving
how
handsomely
to
get
quit
of
each
other
who
was
left
in
to
take
care
of
his
lord
s
affairs
there
and
that
as
soon
as
he
had
heard
of
arrival
he
should
come
with
all
speed
and
give
him
notice
thought
every
minute
an
hour
till
he
could
see
again
the
charmer
of
his
soul
for
whom
he
suffered
continual
fevers
of
love
he
studies
nothing
but
how
first
to
get
her
pardon
and
then
to
compass
his
designs
of
possessing
her
he
had
not
seen
her
nor
durst
pretend
to
it
since
she
left
he
believed
she
would
have
the
discretion
to
conceal
some
of
his
faults
lest
he
should
discover
in
revenge
some
of
hers
and
fancied
she
would
imagine
so
of
his
conduct
he
had
met
with
no
reproaches
yet
from
his
lord
and
believed
himself
safe
with
this
imagination
he
omitted
nothing
that
might
render
him
acceptable
to
her
nor
to
gain
any
secrets
he
believed
might
be
of
use
to
him
knowing
therefore
she
had
not
dealt
very
generously
with
by
this
flight
with
and
believing
that
that
exasperated
lover
would
in
revenge
declare
any
thing
to
the
prejudice
of
the
fair
fugitive
he
under
pretence
of
throwing
himself
at
his
feet
and
asking
his
pardon
for
his
ill
treating
him
in
designed
before
he
went
into
to
pay
a
visit
and
accordingly
went
he
met
first
with
his
page
who
being
very
well
acquainted
with
discoursed
with
him
before
he
carried
him
to
his
lord
he
told
him
that
his
lord
that
day
that
departed
being
in
impatient
expectation
of
her
and
that
she
came
not
according
to
appointment
sent
him
to
her
lodgings
to
know
if
any
accident
had
prevented
her
coming
but
that
when
he
came
though
he
had
been
with
her
but
an
hour
before
she
was
gone
away
with
never
more
to
return
the
youth
not
being
able
to
carry
this
sad
news
to
his
lord
when
he
came
home
offered
at
a
hundred
things
to
conceal
the
right
but
the
impatient
lover
would
not
be
answered
but
all
enraged
commanded
him
to
tell
that
truth
which
he
found
already
but
too
apparently
in
his
eyes
the
lad
so
commanded
could
no
longer
defer
telling
him
was
gone
and
being
asked
again
and
again
what
he
meant
with
a
face
and
voice
that
every
moment
altered
to
dying
the
page
assured
him
she
was
gone
out
of
with
never
more
to
return
which
was
no
sooner
told
him
but
he
sunk
on
the
couch
where
he
lay
and
fainted
he
farther
told
him
how
long
it
was
and
with
what
difficulty
he
was
recovered
to
life
and
that
after
he
was
so
he
refused
to
speak
or
see
any
visitors
could
for
a
long
time
be
neither
persuaded
to
eat
nor
sleep
but
that
he
had
spoken
to
no
body
ever
since
and
did
now
believe
he
could
not
procure
him
the
favour
he
begged
that
nevertheless
he
would
go
and
see
what
the
very
name
of
any
that
had
but
a
relation
to
the
family
of
would
produce
in
him
whether
a
storm
of
passion
or
a
calm
of
grief
either
would
be
better
than
a
dullness
all
silent
and
sad
in
which
there
was
no
understanding
what
he
meant
by
it
whoever
spoke
he
only
made
a
short
sign
and
turned
away
as
much
as
to
say
speak
no
more
to
me
but
now
resolved
to
try
his
temper
he
hastened
to
his
lord
and
told
him
that
full
of
penitence
for
his
past
fault
and
grief
for
the
ill
condition
he
heard
he
was
in
was
come
to
pay
his
humble
respects
to
him
and
gain
his
pardon
before
he
went
to
his
lord
and
without
which
he
had
not
nor
could
have
any
peace
of
mind
he
being
too
sensible
of
the
baseness
of
the
injury
he
had
done
him
at
the
name
of
and
shewed
some
signs
of
listening
but
to
the
rest
no
regard
and
starting
from
the
bed
where
he
was
laid
ah
what
hast
thou
said
cried
he
the
page
then
repeated
the
message
and
was
commanded
to
bring
him
up
who
accordingly
with
all
the
signs
of
submission
cast
himself
at
his
feet
and
mercy
and
though
he
were
an
enemy
the
very
thought
that
he
belonged
to
made
to
caress
him
as
the
dearest
of
friends
he
kept
him
with
him
two
or
three
days
and
would
not
suffer
him
to
stir
from
him
but
all
their
discourse
was
of
the
faithless
of
whom
the
deceived
lover
spoke
the
softest
unheard
tender
things
that
ever
passion
uttered
he
made
the
amorous
weep
a
hundred
times
a
day
and
ever
when
he
would
have
soothed
his
heart
with
hopes
of
seeing
her
and
one
day
enjoying
her
entirely
to
himself
he
would
with
so
much
peace
of
mind
renounce
her
as
brilliard
no
longer
doubted
but
he
would
indeed
no
more
trust
her
fickle
sex
at
last
the
news
arrived
that
cesario
was
in
brussels
and
brilliard
was
obliged
the
next
morning
to
take
horse
and
go
to
his
lord
and
to
make
himself
the
more
acceptable
to
sylvia
he
humbly
besought
octavio
to
write
some
part
of
his
resentments
to
her
that
he
might
oblige
her
to
a
reason
for
what
she
had
so
inhumanly
done
this
flattered
him
a
little
and
he
was
not
long
before
he
was
overcome
by
brilliard
s
entreaties
who
having
his
ends
in
every
thing
believed
this
letter
might
contain
at
least
something
to
assist
in
his
design
by
giving
him
authority
over
her
by
so
great
a
secret
the
next
morning
before
he
took
horse
he
waited
on
octavio
for
his
letter
and
promised
him
an
answer
at
his
return
which
would
be
in
a
few
days
this
letter
was
open
and
octavio
suffered
brilliard
to
read
it
making
him
an
absolute
confidant
in
his
amour
which
having
done
he
besought
him
to
add
one
thing
more
to
it
and
that
was
to
beg
her
to
forgive
brilliard
which
for
his
sake
he
knew
she
would
do
he
told
him
he
was
obliged
as
a
good
christian
and
a
dying
man
one
resolved
for
heaven
to
do
that
good
office
and
accordingly
did
brilliard
taking
post
immediately
arrived
to
philander
where
he
found
every
thing
as
he
wished
all
out
of
humour
still
on
the
fret
and
ever
peevish
he
had
not
seen
sylvia
as
i
said
since
she
went
from
holland
and
now
knew
not
which
way
to
approach
her
philander
was
abroad
on
some
of
his
usual
gallantries
when
brilliard
arrived
and
having
discoursed
a
while
of
the
affairs
of
his
lord
and
sylvia
he
told
antonet
he
had
a
great
desire
to
speak
with
that
dissatisfied
fair
one
assuring
her
he
believed
his
visit
would
be
welcome
from
what
he
had
to
say
to
her
concerning
octavio
she
told
him
with
infinite
joy
that
she
did
not
doubt
of
his
pardon
from
her
lady
if
he
brought
any
news
from
that
gallant
injured
man
and
in
all
haste
though
her
lady
saw
no
body
but
refused
to
rise
from
her
couch
she
ran
to
her
and
besought
her
to
see
brilliard
for
he
came
with
a
message
from
octavio
the
person
who
was
the
subject
of
their
discourse
night
and
day
when
alone
she
immediately
sent
for
brilliard
who
approached
his
goddess
with
a
trembling
devotion
he
knelt
before
her
and
humbly
besought
her
pardon
for
all
that
was
past
but
she
who
with
the
very
thought
that
he
had
something
to
say
from
octavio
forgot
all
but
that
hastily
bid
him
rise
and
take
all
he
asked
and
hoped
for
what
he
wished
in
this
transport
she
embraced
his
head
and
kissed
his
cheek
and
took
him
up
that
madam
said
which
your
divine
bounty
alone
has
given
me
without
any
merit
in
me
i
durst
not
have
had
the
confidence
to
have
hoped
without
my
credential
from
a
nobler
hand
this
madam
said
he
and
gave
her
a
letter
from
the
dear
hand
she
knew
and
kissed
a
hundred
times
as
she
opened
it
and
having
entreated
to
withdraw
for
a
moment
that
he
might
not
see
her
concern
at
the
reading
it
she
sat
her
down
and
found
it
thus
octavio
sylvia
i
confess
oh
faithless
that
i
shall
appear
in
writing
to
you
to
shew
a
weakness
even
below
that
of
your
infidelity
nor
durst
i
have
trusted
myself
to
have
spoken
so
many
sad
soft
things
as
i
shall
do
in
this
letter
had
i
not
tried
the
strength
of
my
heart
and
found
i
could
upbraid
you
without
talking
myself
out
of
that
resolution
i
have
taken
but
because
i
would
die
in
perfect
charity
with
thee
as
with
all
the
world
i
should
be
glad
to
know
i
could
forgive
thee
for
yet
thy
sins
appear
too
black
for
mercy
ah
why
charming
ingrate
have
you
left
me
no
one
excuse
for
all
your
ills
to
me
why
have
you
injured
me
to
that
degree
that
i
with
all
the
mighty
stock
of
love
i
had
hoarded
up
together
in
my
heart
must
die
reproaching
thee
to
my
last
gasp
of
life
which
hadst
thou
been
so
merciful
to
have
ended
by
all
the
love
that
s
breaking
of
my
heart
that
yet
even
yet
is
soft
and
charming
to
me
i
swear
with
my
last
breath
i
had
blessed
thee
but
thus
to
use
me
thus
to
leave
my
love
distracted
raving
love
and
no
one
hope
or
prospect
of
relief
either
from
reason
time
or
faithless
was
but
to
stretch
the
wretch
upon
the
rack
and
screw
him
up
to
all
degrees
of
pain
yet
such
as
do
not
end
in
kinder
death
oh
thou
unhappy
miner
of
my
repose
oh
fair
unfortunate
if
yet
my
agony
would
give
me
leave
to
argue
i
am
so
miserably
lost
to
ask
thee
yet
this
woeful
satisfaction
to
tell
me
why
thou
hast
undone
me
thus
why
thou
shouldst
choose
me
out
from
all
the
crowd
of
fond
admiring
fools
to
make
the
world
s
reproach
and
turn
to
ridicule
how
couldst
thou
use
that
soft
good
nature
so
that
had
not
one
ungrateful
sullen
humour
in
it
for
thy
revenge
and
pride
to
work
upon
no
baseness
in
my
love
no
dull
severity
for
malice
to
be
busy
with
but
all
was
gay
and
kind
all
lavish
fondness
and
all
that
woman
vain
with
youth
and
beauty
could
wish
in
her
adorer
what
couldst
thou
ask
but
empire
which
i
gave
not
my
love
my
soul
my
life
my
very
honour
all
was
resigned
to
thee
that
youth
that
might
have
gained
me
fame
abroad
was
dedicated
to
thy
service
laid
at
thy
feet
and
idly
passed
in
love
oh
charming
maid
whom
heaven
has
formed
for
the
punishment
of
all
whose
flames
are
criminal
why
couldst
not
thou
have
made
some
kind
distinction
between
those
common
passions
and
my
flame
i
gave
thee
all
my
vows
my
honest
vows
before
i
asked
a
recompense
for
love
i
made
thee
mine
before
the
sacred
powers
that
witness
every
sacred
solemn
vow
and
fix
them
in
the
eternal
book
of
fate
if
thou
hadst
given
thy
faith
to
any
other
as
oh
too
sure
thou
hadst
what
fault
was
this
in
me
who
knew
it
not
why
should
i
bear
that
sin
i
took
thee
to
me
as
a
virgin
treasure
sent
from
the
gods
to
charm
the
ills
of
life
to
make
the
tedious
journey
short
and
joyful
i
came
to
make
atonement
for
thy
sin
and
to
redeem
thy
fame
not
add
to
the
detested
number
i
came
to
gild
thy
stains
of
honour
over
and
set
so
high
a
price
upon
thy
name
that
all
reproaches
for
thy
past
offences
should
have
been
lost
in
future
crowds
of
glory
i
came
to
lead
thee
from
a
world
of
shame
approaching
ills
and
future
miseries
from
noisy
flatterers
that
would
sacrifice
thee
first
to
dull
lust
and
more
unthinking
wit
possess
thee
then
traduce
thee
by
heaven
i
swear
it
was
not
for
myself
alone
i
took
such
pains
to
gain
thee
and
set
thee
free
from
all
those
circumstances
that
might
perhaps
debauch
thy
worthier
nature
and
i
believed
it
was
with
pain
you
yielded
to
every
buying
lover
no
it
was
for
thy
sake
in
pity
to
thy
youth
heaven
had
inspired
me
with
religious
flame
and
when
i
aimed
at
it
was
alone
i
might
attain
to
heaven
the
surest
way
by
such
a
pious
conquest
why
hast
thou
ruined
a
design
so
glorious
as
saving
both
our
souls
perhaps
thou
vainly
thinkest
that
while
i
am
pleading
thus
i
am
arguing
still
for
love
or
think
this
way
to
move
thee
into
pity
no
by
my
hopes
of
death
to
ease
my
pain
love
is
a
passion
not
to
be
compelled
by
any
force
of
reason
s
arguments
it
is
an
unthinking
motion
of
the
soul
that
comes
and
goes
as
unaccountably
as
changing
moons
or
ebbs
and
flows
of
rivers
only
with
far
less
certainty
it
is
not
that
my
soul
is
all
over
love
that
can
beget
its
likeness
in
your
heart
had
heaven
and
nature
added
to
that
love
all
the
perfections
that
adorn
our
sex
it
had
availed
me
nothing
in
your
soul
there
is
a
chance
in
love
as
well
as
life
and
often
the
most
unworthy
are
preferred
and
from
a
lottery
i
might
win
the
prize
from
all
the
venturing
throng
with
as
much
reason
as
think
my
chance
should
favour
me
with
it
might
perhaps
have
been
but
it
was
a
wondrous
odds
against
me
beauty
is
more
uncertain
than
the
dice
and
though
i
ventured
like
a
forward
gamester
i
was
not
yet
so
vain
to
hope
to
win
nor
had
i
once
complained
upon
my
fate
if
i
had
never
hoped
but
when
i
had
fairly
won
to
have
it
basely
snatched
from
my
possession
and
like
a
baffled
cully
see
it
seized
by
a
false
gamester
and
look
tamely
on
has
given
me
such
of
the
fool
i
scorn
to
look
into
my
easy
heart
and
loathe
the
figure
you
made
me
there
oh
what
an
angel
hadst
thou
been
hadst
thou
not
soothed
me
thus
to
my
undoing
alas
it
had
been
no
crime
in
thee
to
hate
me
it
was
not
thy
fault
i
was
not
amiable
if
thy
soft
eyes
could
meet
no
charms
to
please
them
those
soft
those
charming
eyes
were
not
in
fault
nor
that
thy
sense
too
delicate
and
nice
could
meet
no
proper
subject
for
thy
wit
thy
heart
thy
tender
heart
was
not
in
fault
because
it
took
not
in
my
tale
of
love
and
sent
soft
wishes
back
oh
no
my
this
though
i
had
died
had
caused
you
no
reproach
but
first
to
fan
my
fire
by
all
the
arts
that
ever
subtle
beauty
could
invent
to
give
me
hope
nay
to
dissemble
love
yes
and
so
very
well
dissemble
too
that
not
one
tender
sigh
was
breathed
in
vain
all
that
my
soul
was
panting
for
the
subtle
charmer
gave
so
well
so
very
well
she
could
dissemble
oh
what
more
proofs
could
i
expect
from
love
what
greater
earnest
of
eternal
victory
oh
thou
hadst
raised
me
to
the
height
of
heaven
to
make
my
fall
to
hell
the
more
precipitate
like
a
fallen
angel
now
i
howl
and
roar
and
curse
that
pride
that
taught
me
first
ambition
it
is
a
poor
satisfaction
now
to
know
if
thou
couldst
yet
tell
truth
what
motive
first
seduced
thee
to
my
ruin
had
it
been
interest
by
heaven
i
would
have
bought
my
wanton
pleasures
at
as
high
rates
as
i
would
gratify
my
real
passions
at
least
when
set
a
price
on
pleasure
nay
higher
yet
for
love
when
it
is
repaid
with
equal
love
it
saves
the
chafferer
a
great
expense
or
were
it
wantonness
of
youth
in
thee
alas
you
might
have
made
me
understood
it
and
i
had
met
you
with
an
equal
ardour
and
never
thought
of
loving
but
quenched
the
blaze
as
soon
as
kindled
and
hoping
for
no
more
had
never
let
my
hasty
flame
arrive
any
higher
than
that
powerful
minute
s
cure
but
oh
in
vain
i
seek
for
reasons
from
thee
perhaps
thy
own
fantastic
fickle
humour
can
not
inform
thee
why
thou
hast
betrayed
me
but
thou
hast
done
it
and
may
it
never
rise
in
judgement
on
thee
nor
fix
a
brand
upon
thy
name
for
ever
greater
than
all
thy
other
guilts
can
load
thee
with
live
fair
deceiver
live
and
charm
to
all
the
heights
of
his
beginning
flame
mayst
thou
be
gaining
power
upon
his
heart
and
bring
it
repentance
for
inconstancy
may
all
thy
beauty
still
maintain
its
lustre
and
all
thy
charms
of
wit
be
new
and
gay
mayst
thou
be
chaste
and
true
and
since
it
was
thy
fate
to
be
undone
let
this
at
least
excuse
the
hapless
maid
it
was
love
alone
betrayed
her
to
that
ruin
and
it
was
only
had
that
power
if
thou
hast
sinned
with
me
as
heaven
is
my
witness
after
i
had
plighted
thee
my
sacred
vows
i
do
not
think
thou
didst
may
all
the
powers
above
forgive
thee
and
those
thou
hast
committed
since
those
vows
will
need
a
world
of
tears
to
wash
away
it
is
i
will
weep
for
both
it
is
i
will
go
and
be
a
sacrifice
to
atone
for
all
our
sins
it
is
i
will
be
the
pressing
penitent
and
watch
and
pray
and
weep
until
heaven
have
mercy
and
may
my
penance
be
accepted
for
thee
farewell
i
have
but
one
request
to
make
thee
which
is
that
thou
wilt
for
sake
forgive
the
faithful
slave
that
brings
thee
this
from
thy
octavio
whose
absence
and
ill
treatment
of
had
but
served
to
raise
her
flame
to
a
much
greater
degree
had
no
sooner
read
this
letter
but
she
suffered
herself
to
be
distracted
with
all
the
different
passions
that
possess
despairing
lovers
sometimes
raving
and
sometimes
sighing
and
weeping
it
was
a
good
while
she
continued
in
these
disorders
still
thinking
on
what
she
had
to
do
next
that
might
redeem
all
being
a
little
come
to
herself
she
thought
good
to
consult
with
in
this
affair
between
whom
and
she
found
there
was
a
very
good
understanding
and
resolving
absolutely
to
quit
she
no
longer
had
any
scruples
or
doubt
what
course
to
take
nor
cared
she
what
price
she
paid
for
a
reconciliation
with
if
any
price
would
purchase
it
in
order
to
this
resolve
fixed
in
her
heart
she
sends
for
whom
she
caresses
anew
with
all
the
fondness
and
familiarity
of
a
woman
who
was
resolved
to
make
him
her
confidant
or
rather
indeed
her
next
gallant
i
have
already
said
he
was
very
handsome
and
very
well
made
and
you
may
believe
he
took
all
the
care
he
could
in
dressing
which
he
understood
very
well
he
had
a
good
deal
of
wit
and
was
very
well
fashioned
and
bred
with
all
these
accomplishments
and
the
addition
of
love
and
youth
he
could
not
be
imagined
to
appear
wholly
indifferent
in
the
eyes
of
any
body
though
hitherto
he
had
in
those
of
whose
heart
was
doting
on
but
now
that
that
passion
was
wholly
extinguished
and
that
their
eternal
quarrels
had
made
almost
a
perpetual
separation
she
being
alone
without
the
conversation
of
men
which
she
loved
and
was
used
to
and
in
her
inclination
naturally
addicted
to
love
she
found
more
agreeable
than
he
used
to
be
which
together
with
the
designs
she
had
upon
him
made
her
take
such
a
freedom
with
him
as
wholly
transported
this
almost
hopeless
lover
she
discourses
with
him
concerning
and
his
condition
and
he
failed
not
to
answer
so
as
to
please
her
right
or
wrong
she
tells
him
how
uneasy
she
was
with
who
every
day
grew
more
and
more
insupportable
to
her
she
tells
him
she
had
a
very
great
inclination
for
and
more
for
his
fortune
that
was
able
to
support
her
than
his
person
she
knew
she
had
a
great
power
over
him
and
however
it
might
seem
now
to
be
diminished
by
her
unlucky
flight
with
she
doubted
not
but
to
reduce
him
to
all
that
love
he
once
professed
to
her
by
telling
him
she
was
forced
away
and
without
her
knowledge
being
carried
only
to
take
the
air
was
compelled
to
the
fatal
place
where
she
now
was
soothes
and
flatters
her
in
all
her
hope
and
offers
her
his
service
in
her
flight
which
he
might
easily
assist
unknown
to
it
was
now
about
six
o
clock
at
night
and
she
commanded
a
supper
to
be
provided
and
brought
to
her
chamber
where
and
she
supped
together
and
talked
of
nothing
but
the
new
design
the
hope
of
effecting
which
put
her
into
so
good
a
humour
that
she
frankly
drank
her
bottle
and
shewed
more
signs
of
mirth
than
she
had
done
in
many
months
before
in
this
good
humour
looked
more
amiable
than
ever
she
smiles
upon
him
she
caresses
him
with
all
the
assurance
of
friendship
imaginable
she
tells
him
she
shall
behold
him
as
her
dearest
friend
and
speaks
so
many
kind
things
that
he
was
emboldened
and
approached
her
by
degrees
more
near
he
makes
advances
and
the
greatest
encouragement
was
the
secret
he
had
of
her
intended
flight
he
tells
her
he
hoped
she
would
be
pleased
to
consider
that
while
he
was
serving
her
in
a
new
amour
and
assisting
to
render
her
into
the
arms
of
another
he
was
wounding
his
own
heart
which
languished
for
her
that
he
should
not
have
taken
the
presumption
to
have
told
her
this
at
such
a
time
as
he
offered
his
life
to
serve
her
but
that
it
was
already
no
secret
to
her
and
that
a
man
who
loved
at
his
rate
and
yet
would
contrive
to
make
his
mistress
happy
with
another
ought
in
justice
to
receive
some
recompense
of
a
flame
so
constant
and
submissive
while
he
spake
he
found
he
was
not
regarded
with
the
looks
of
scorn
or
disdain
he
knew
her
haughty
temper
and
finding
it
calm
he
pressed
on
to
new
submissions
he
fell
at
her
feet
and
pleaded
so
well
where
no
opposers
were
that
no
longer
resisted
or
if
she
did
it
was
very
feebly
and
with
a
sort
of
a
wish
that
he
would
pursue
his
boldness
yet
farther
which
at
last
he
did
from
one
degree
of
softness
and
gentle
force
to
another
and
made
himself
the
happiest
man
in
the
world
though
she
was
very
much
disordered
at
the
apprehension
of
what
she
had
suffered
from
a
man
of
his
character
as
she
imagined
so
infinitely
below
her
but
he
redoubled
his
submission
in
so
cunning
a
manner
that
he
soon
brought
her
to
her
good
humour
and
after
that
he
used
the
kind
authority
of
a
husband
whenever
he
had
an
opportunity
and
found
her
not
displeased
at
his
services
she
considered
he
had
a
secret
from
her
which
if
revealed
would
not
only
prevent
her
design
but
ruin
her
for
ever
she
found
too
late
she
had
discovered
too
much
to
him
to
keep
him
at
the
distance
of
a
servant
and
that
she
had
no
other
way
to
attach
him
eternally
to
her
interest
but
by
this
means
he
now
every
day
appeared
more
fine
and
well
dressed
and
omitted
nothing
that
might
make
him
if
possible
an
absolute
master
of
her
heart
which
he
vowed
he
would
defend
with
his
life
from
even
himself
and
that
he
would
pretend
to
no
other
empire
over
her
nor
presume
or
pretend
to
engross
that
fair
and
charming
person
which
ought
to
be
universally
adored
in
fine
he
failed
not
to
please
both
her
desire
and
her
vanity
and
every
day
she
loved
less
who
sometimes
in
two
or
three
days
together
came
not
to
visit
her
at
this
time
it
so
happened
he
being
in
love
with
the
young
daughter
of
an
advocate
about
a
league
from
his
own
lodgings
and
he
is
always
eager
on
the
first
address
till
he
has
completed
the
conquest
so
that
she
had
not
only
time
to
please
and
revenge
her
with
but
fully
to
resolve
their
affairs
and
to
provide
all
things
against
their
flight
which
they
had
absolutely
done
before
return
who
coming
home
received
very
kindly
and
the
news
which
he
brought
and
which
made
him
understand
he
should
not
have
any
long
time
to
finish
his
new
amour
in
but
as
he
was
very
conquering
both
in
wit
and
beauty
he
left
not
the
village
without
some
ruins
behind
of
beauty
which
ever
after
bewailed
his
charms
and
since
his
departure
was
so
necessary
and
that
in
four
or
five
days
he
was
obliged
to
go
they
deferred
their
flight
till
he
was
gone
which
time
they
had
wholly
to
themselves
and
made
as
good
use
of
it
as
they
could
at
least
she
thought
so
and
you
may
be
sure
he
also
whose
love
increased
with
his
possession
but
longs
for
liberty
and
those
necessary
gallantries
which
every
day
diminished
she
loved
rich
clothes
gay
coaches
and
to
be
lavish
and
now
she
was
stinted
to
good
housewifery
a
penury
she
hated
the
time
of
departure
being
come
he
took
a
very
careless
leave
of
telling
her
he
would
see
what
commands
the
prince
had
for
him
and
return
in
ten
or
twelve
days
pretended
some
little
indisposition
and
begged
he
might
be
permitted
to
follow
him
which
was
granted
and
the
next
day
though
brilliard
pleaded
infinitely
for
a
continuation
of
his
happiness
two
or
three
days
more
she
would
not
grant
it
but
obliged
him
by
a
thousand
kind
promises
of
it
for
the
future
to
get
horses
ready
for
her
page
and
woman
and
her
coach
for
herself
which
accordingly
was
done
and
they
left
the
village
whose
name
i
can
not
now
call
to
mind
taking
with
her
what
of
value
she
had
left
they
were
three
days
on
their
journey
under
pretence
of
care
of
her
health
the
weather
being
hot
and
for
fear
of
overtaking
by
some
accident
on
the
road
delayed
the
time
as
much
as
was
possible
to
be
as
happy
as
he
could
all
the
while
and
indeed
was
never
seen
in
a
humour
more
gay
she
found
this
short
time
of
hope
and
pleasure
had
brought
all
her
banished
beauties
back
that
care
sickness
and
grief
had
extremely
tarnished
only
her
shape
was
a
little
more
inclining
to
be
fat
which
did
not
at
all
however
yet
impair
her
fineness
and
she
was
indeed
too
charming
without
for
the
deformity
of
her
indiscretion
within
but
she
had
broke
the
bounds
of
honour
and
now
stuck
at
nothing
that
might
carry
on
an
interest
which
she
resolved
should
be
the
business
of
her
future
life
she
at
last
arrived
at
and
caused
a
lodging
to
be
taken
for
her
in
the
remotest
part
of
the
town
as
soon
as
she
came
she
obliged
to
visit
but
going
to
his
aunt
s
to
inquire
for
him
he
was
told
that
he
was
no
longer
in
the
world
he
stood
amazed
believing
he
had
been
dead
when
madam
the
aunt
told
him
he
was
retired
to
the
monastery
of
the
order
of
st
and
would
in
a
day
or
two
without
the
probationary
year
take
holy
orders
this
did
not
so
much
surprise
him
as
the
other
knowing
that
he
discoursed
to
him
when
he
saw
him
last
as
if
some
such
retirement
he
meant
to
resolve
upon
with
this
news
which
he
was
not
altogether
displeased
at
returned
to
which
soon
changed
all
her
good
humour
to
tears
and
melancholy
she
inquired
at
what
place
he
was
and
believed
she
should
have
power
to
withdraw
him
from
a
resolution
so
fatal
to
her
and
so
contradictive
to
his
youth
and
fortune
and
having
consulted
the
matter
with
he
had
promised
her
to
go
to
him
and
use
all
means
possible
to
withdraw
him
this
resolved
she
writ
a
most
insinuating
letter
to
him
wherein
she
excused
her
flight
by
a
surprise
of
and
urged
her
condition
as
it
then
was
for
the
excuse
of
her
long
silence
and
that
as
soon
as
her
health
would
give
her
leave
she
came
to
put
herself
eternally
into
his
arms
never
to
depart
more
from
thence
these
arguments
and
reasons
accompanied
with
all
the
endearing
tenderness
her
artful
fancy
was
capable
of
framing
she
sent
with
a
full
assurance
it
would
prevail
to
persuade
him
to
the
world
and
her
fair
arms
again
while
she
was
preparing
this
to
go
who
had
heard
at
his
arrival
what
made
so
much
noise
that
he
had
been
the
occasion
of
the
world
s
loss
of
two
of
the
finest
persons
in
it
the
sister
by
debauching
her
and
the
brother
by
ravishing
his
mistress
from
him
both
which
were
entering
without
all
possibility
of
prevention
into
holy
orders
he
took
so
great
a
melancholy
at
it
as
made
him
keep
his
chamber
for
two
days
maugre
all
the
urgent
affairs
that
ought
to
have
invited
him
from
thence
he
was
consulting
by
what
power
to
prevent
the
misfortune
he
now
ran
back
to
all
the
obligations
he
had
to
and
pardons
him
all
the
injuries
he
did
him
he
loves
him
more
by
loving
less
and
remembered
how
that
generous
friend
after
he
knew
he
had
dishonoured
his
sister
had
notwithstanding
sent
him
letters
of
credit
to
the
magistrates
of
and
bills
of
exchange
to
save
him
from
the
murder
of
his
as
he
was
likely
to
have
been
he
now
charges
all
his
little
faults
to
those
of
love
and
hearing
that
old
was
dead
of
the
wound
had
given
him
by
mistake
which
increased
in
him
new
hope
of
could
she
be
retrieved
from
the
monastery
he
resolved
in
order
to
this
to
make
a
visit
to
beg
his
pardon
and
beg
his
friendship
and
his
continuation
in
the
world
he
came
accordingly
to
the
monastery
and
was
extremely
civilly
received
by
who
yet
had
not
the
habit
on
told
him
he
heard
he
was
leaving
the
world
and
could
not
suffer
him
to
do
so
without
endeavouring
to
gain
his
pardon
of
him
for
all
the
injuries
he
had
done
him
that
as
to
what
related
to
his
sister
the
countess
he
protested
upon
his
honour
if
he
had
but
imagined
she
had
been
so
he
would
have
suffered
death
sooner
than
his
passion
to
have
approached
her
indiscreetly
and
that
for
if
he
were
assured
her
possession
would
make
him
happy
and
call
him
to
the
world
again
he
assured
him
he
would
quit
her
to
him
were
she
ten
times
dearer
to
him
than
she
was
this
he
confirmed
with
so
many
protestations
of
friendship
that
obliged
to
the
last
degree
believed
and
returned
him
this
answer
sir
i
must
confess
you
have
found
out
the
only
way
to
disarm
me
of
my
resentment
against
you
if
i
were
not
obliged
by
those
vows
i
am
going
to
take
to
pardon
and
be
at
peace
with
all
the
world
however
these
vows
can
not
hinder
me
from
conserving
entirely
that
friendship
in
my
heart
which
your
good
qualities
and
beauties
at
first
sight
engaged
there
and
from
esteeming
you
more
than
perhaps
i
ought
to
do
the
man
whom
i
must
yet
own
my
rival
and
the
undoer
of
my
sister
s
honour
but
oh
no
more
of
that
a
friend
is
above
a
sister
or
a
at
this
he
hung
down
his
eyes
and
sighed
told
him
he
was
too
much
concerned
in
him
not
to
be
extremely
afflicted
at
the
resolution
he
had
taken
and
besought
him
to
quit
a
design
so
injurious
to
his
youth
and
the
glorious
things
that
heaven
had
destined
him
to
he
urged
all
that
could
be
said
to
dissuade
him
and
after
all
could
not
believe
he
would
quit
the
world
at
this
age
when
it
would
be
sufficient
forty
years
hence
so
to
do
only
answered
with
a
smile
but
when
he
saw
still
persist
he
endeavoured
to
convince
him
by
speaking
and
lifting
up
his
eyes
to
heaven
he
vowed
by
all
the
holy
powers
there
he
never
would
look
down
to
earth
again
nor
more
consider
fickle
faithless
beauty
all
the
gay
vanities
of
youth
said
he
for
ever
i
renounce
and
leave
them
all
to
those
that
find
a
pleasure
or
a
constancy
in
them
for
the
fair
faithless
maid
that
has
undone
me
i
leave
to
you
the
empire
of
her
heart
but
have
a
care
said
he
and
sighing
laid
his
arms
about
his
neck
for
even
you
with
all
that
stock
of
charms
she
will
at
last
betray
i
wish
her
well
so
well
as
to
repent
of
all
her
wrongs
to
me
it
is
all
i
have
to
what
could
urge
being
impossible
to
prevail
with
him
and
begging
his
pardon
and
friendship
which
was
granted
by
and
implored
on
his
side
from
he
took
a
ring
of
great
value
from
his
finger
and
presented
it
to
and
begged
him
to
keep
it
for
his
sake
and
to
remember
him
while
he
did
so
they
kissed
and
sighing
parted
was
no
sooner
gone
but
came
to
wait
on
whom
he
found
at
his
devotion
and
begged
his
pardon
for
disturbing
him
he
received
him
with
a
very
good
grace
and
a
cheerful
countenance
embracing
him
and
after
some
discourse
of
the
condition
he
was
going
to
reduce
himself
to
and
his
admiration
that
one
so
young
should
think
of
devoting
himself
so
early
to
heaven
and
things
of
that
nature
as
the
time
and
occasion
required
he
told
him
the
extreme
affliction
was
seized
with
at
the
news
of
the
resolution
he
had
taken
and
delivered
him
a
letter
which
he
read
without
any
emotions
in
his
heart
or
face
as
at
other
times
used
to
be
visible
at
the
very
mention
of
her
name
or
approach
of
her
letters
at
the
finishing
of
which
he
only
smiling
cried
alas
i
pity
her
and
gave
him
back
the
letter
asked
if
he
would
not
please
to
write
her
some
answer
or
condescend
to
see
her
replied
i
have
done
with
all
the
gilded
vanities
of
life
now
i
shall
think
of
but
as
some
heavenly
thing
fit
for
diviner
contemplations
but
never
with
the
youthful
thoughts
of
what
he
should
send
her
now
he
said
would
have
a
different
style
to
those
she
used
to
receive
from
him
it
would
be
pious
counsel
grave
advice
unfit
for
ladies
so
young
and
gay
as
and
would
scarce
find
a
welcome
he
wished
he
could
convert
her
from
the
world
and
save
her
from
the
dangers
that
pursued
her
to
this
purpose
was
all
he
said
of
her
and
all
that
could
be
got
from
him
by
the
earnest
solicitor
of
love
who
perhaps
was
glad
his
negotiation
succeeded
no
better
and
took
his
leave
of
him
with
a
promise
to
visit
him
often
which
besought
him
to
do
and
told
him
he
would
take
some
care
that
for
the
good
of
better
part
she
should
not
be
reduced
by
want
of
necessaries
for
her
life
and
little
equipage
to
prostitute
herself
to
vile
inconstant
man
he
yet
had
so
much
respect
for
her
and
besought
to
come
and
take
care
of
it
with
him
and
to
entreat
to
accept
of
it
from
him
and
if
it
contributed
to
her
future
happiness
he
should
be
more
pleased
than
to
have
possessed
her
entirely
you
may
imagine
how
this
news
pleased
who
trembling
with
fear
every
moment
had
expected
coming
and
found
no
other
benefit
by
his
negotiation
but
she
must
bear
what
she
can
not
avoid
but
it
was
rather
with
the
fury
of
a
bacchanal
than
a
woman
of
common
sense
and
prudence
all
about
her
pleaded
some
days
in
vain
and
she
hated
for
not
doing
impossibilities
and
it
was
some
time
before
he
could
bring
her
to
permit
him
to
speak
to
her
or
visit
her
having
left
went
immediately
to
wait
on
who
was
extremely
pleased
to
meet
him
there
and
they
exchanged
their
souls
to
each
other
and
all
the
secrets
of
them
after
they
had
discoursed
of
all
that
they
had
a
mind
to
hear
and
know
on
both
sides
inquired
of
him
of
health
and
gave
him
an
account
of
the
uneasiness
of
her
temper
and
the
occasions
of
their
quarrels
in
which
had
his
part
as
being
the
subject
of
some
of
them
from
this
he
falls
to
give
a
character
of
that
rival
and
came
to
this
part
of
it
where
he
had
put
himself
into
the
orders
of
the
resolving
to
leave
the
world
and
all
its
charms
and
temptations
as
they
were
speaking
some
gentlemen
who
came
to
make
their
court
to
the
prince
finding
them
speak
of
told
them
that
he
was
to
be
initiated
without
the
year
s
trial
the
prince
would
needs
go
and
see
the
ceremony
having
heard
so
much
of
the
man
and
accordingly
next
day
accompanied
with
the
governor
and
abundance
of
persons
of
quality
and
officers
he
went
to
the
great
church
where
were
present
all
the
ladies
of
the
court
and
all
that
were
in
the
town
the
noise
of
it
was
so
great
that
all
languishing
and
ill
as
she
was
would
not
be
persuaded
from
going
but
so
muffled
in
her
hoods
as
she
was
not
to
be
known
by
any
never
was
any
thing
so
magnificent
as
this
ceremony
the
church
was
on
no
occasion
so
richly
adorned
chanced
to
be
seated
near
the
prince
of
who
was
then
in
and
at
the
ceremony
sad
as
she
was
while
the
soft
music
was
playing
she
discoursed
to
him
though
she
knew
him
not
of
the
business
of
the
day
he
told
her
she
was
to
see
a
sight
that
ought
to
make
her
sex
less
cruel
a
man
extremely
beautiful
and
young
whose
fortune
could
command
almost
all
the
pleasures
of
the
world
yet
for
the
love
of
the
most
amiable
creature
in
the
world
who
has
treated
him
with
rigour
he
abandons
this
youth
and
beauty
to
all
the
severity
of
rigid
devotion
this
relation
with
a
great
deal
he
said
of
virtues
and
bravery
had
like
to
have
discovered
her
by
putting
her
into
a
swoon
and
she
had
much
ado
to
support
herself
in
her
seat
i
myself
went
among
the
rest
to
this
ceremony
having
in
all
the
time
i
lived
in
never
been
so
curious
to
see
any
such
thing
the
order
of
st
is
one
of
the
neatest
of
them
and
there
is
a
monastery
of
that
order
which
are
obliged
to
be
all
noblemen
s
sons
of
which
i
have
seen
fifteen
hundred
at
a
time
in
one
house
all
handsome
and
most
of
them
young
their
habit
adds
a
grace
to
their
person
for
of
all
the
religious
that
is
the
most
becoming
long
white
vests
of
fine
cloth
tied
about
with
white
silk
sashes
or
a
cord
of
white
silk
over
this
a
long
cloak
without
a
cape
of
the
same
fine
white
broad
cloth
their
hair
of
a
pretty
length
as
that
of
our
persons
in
and
a
white
beaver
they
have
very
fine
apartments
fit
for
their
quality
and
above
all
every
one
their
library
they
have
attendance
and
equipage
according
to
their
rank
and
have
nothing
of
the
inconveniencies
and
slovenliness
of
some
of
the
religious
but
served
in
as
good
order
as
can
be
and
they
have
nothing
of
the
monastic
but
the
name
the
vow
of
chastity
and
the
opportunity
of
gaining
heaven
by
the
sweetest
retreat
in
the
world
fine
house
excellent
air
and
delicate
gardens
grottoes
and
groves
it
was
this
order
that
had
chosen
as
too
delicate
to
undertake
the
austerity
of
any
other
and
in
my
opinion
it
is
here
a
man
may
hope
to
become
a
saint
sooner
than
in
any
other
more
perplexed
with
want
cold
and
all
the
necessaries
of
life
which
takes
the
thought
too
much
from
heaven
and
afflicts
it
with
the
cares
of
this
world
with
pain
and
too
much
abstinence
and
i
rather
think
it
is
necessity
than
choice
that
makes
a
man
a
that
may
be
a
or
to
the
best
of
the
but
to
return
it
was
upon
a
this
ceremony
began
and
as
i
said
there
was
never
any
thing
beheld
so
fine
as
the
church
that
day
was
and
all
the
fathers
that
officiated
at
the
behind
which
a
most
magnificent
scene
of
glory
was
opened
with
clouds
most
rarely
and
artificially
set
off
behind
which
appeared
new
ones
more
bright
and
dazzling
till
from
one
degree
to
another
their
lustre
was
hardly
able
to
be
looked
on
and
in
which
sat
an
hundred
little
angels
so
rarely
dressed
such
shining
robes
such
charming
faces
such
flowing
bright
hair
crowned
with
roses
of
white
and
red
with
such
artificial
wings
as
one
would
have
said
they
had
borne
the
body
up
in
the
splendid
sky
and
these
to
soft
music
turned
their
soft
voices
with
such
sweetness
of
harmony
that
for
my
part
i
confess
i
thought
myself
no
longer
on
earth
and
sure
there
is
nothing
gives
an
idea
of
real
heaven
like
a
church
all
adorned
with
rare
pictures
and
the
other
ornaments
of
it
with
whatever
can
charm
the
eyes
and
music
and
voices
to
ravish
the
ear
both
which
inspire
the
soul
with
unresistible
devotion
and
i
can
swear
for
my
own
part
in
those
moments
a
thousand
times
i
have
wished
to
die
so
absolutely
had
i
forgot
the
world
and
all
its
vanities
and
fixed
my
thoughts
on
heaven
while
this
music
continued
and
the
anthems
were
singing
fifty
boys
all
in
white
bearing
silver
censers
cast
incense
all
round
and
perfumed
the
place
with
the
richest
and
most
agreeable
smells
while
two
hundred
silver
lamps
were
burning
upon
the
altar
to
give
a
greater
glory
to
the
opened
scene
whilst
other
boys
strewed
flowers
upon
the
inlaid
pavement
where
the
gay
victim
was
to
tread
for
no
crowd
of
gazers
filled
the
empty
space
but
those
that
were
spectators
were
so
placed
as
rather
served
to
adorn
than
disorder
the
awful
ceremony
where
all
were
silent
and
as
still
as
death
as
awful
as
mourners
that
attend
the
hearse
of
some
loved
monarch
while
we
were
thus
listening
the
soft
music
playing
and
the
angels
singing
the
whole
fraternity
of
the
order
of
st
came
in
two
by
two
in
a
very
graceful
order
and
going
up
to
the
shining
altar
whose
furniture
that
day
was
embroidered
with
diamonds
pearls
and
stones
of
great
value
they
bowed
and
retired
to
their
places
into
little
gilded
stalls
like
our
knights
of
the
garter
at
after
them
fifty
boys
that
sang
approached
in
order
to
the
altar
bowed
and
divided
on
each
side
they
were
dressed
in
white
cloth
of
silver
with
golden
wings
and
rosy
chaplets
after
these
the
bishop
in
his
pontific
robes
set
with
diamonds
of
great
price
and
his
mitre
richly
adorned
ascended
the
altar
where
after
a
short
anthem
he
turned
to
receive
the
young
devotee
who
was
just
entered
the
church
while
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
he
was
led
or
rather
on
each
side
attended
with
two
young
noblemen
his
relations
and
i
never
saw
any
thing
more
rich
in
dress
but
that
of
exceeded
all
imagination
for
the
gaiety
and
fineness
of
the
work
it
was
white
cloth
of
silver
embroidered
with
gold
and
buttons
of
diamonds
lined
with
rich
cloth
of
gold
and
silver
flowers
his
breeches
of
the
same
trimmed
with
a
pale
pink
garniture
rich
linen
and
a
white
plume
in
his
white
hat
his
hair
which
was
long
and
black
was
that
day
in
the
finest
order
that
could
be
imagined
but
for
his
face
and
eyes
i
am
not
able
to
describe
the
charms
that
adorned
them
no
fancy
no
imagination
can
paint
the
beauties
there
he
looked
indeed
as
if
he
were
made
for
heaven
no
mortal
ever
had
such
grace
he
looked
methought
as
if
the
gods
of
love
had
met
in
council
to
dress
him
up
that
day
for
everlasting
conquest
for
to
his
usual
beauties
he
seemed
to
have
the
addition
of
a
thousand
more
he
bore
new
lustre
in
his
face
and
eyes
smiles
on
his
cheeks
and
dimples
on
his
lips
he
moved
he
trod
with
nobler
motions
as
if
some
supernatural
influence
had
took
a
peculiar
care
of
him
ten
thousand
sighs
from
all
sides
were
sent
him
as
he
passed
along
which
mixed
with
the
soft
music
made
such
a
murmuring
as
gentle
breezes
moving
yielding
boughs
i
am
assured
he
won
that
day
more
hearts
without
design
than
ever
he
had
gained
with
all
his
toils
of
love
and
youth
before
when
industry
assisted
him
to
conquer
in
his
approach
to
the
altar
he
made
three
bows
where
at
the
foot
of
it
on
the
lower
step
he
kneeled
and
then
began
in
which
were
all
sorts
of
different
music
and
that
so
excellent
that
wholly
ravished
with
what
i
saw
and
heard
i
fancied
myself
no
longer
on
earth
but
absolutely
ascended
up
to
the
regions
of
the
sky
all
i
could
see
around
me
all
i
heard
was
ravishing
and
heavenly
the
scene
of
glory
and
the
dazzling
altar
the
noble
paintings
and
the
numerous
lamps
the
awfulness
the
music
and
the
order
made
me
conceive
myself
above
the
stars
and
i
had
no
part
of
mortal
thought
about
me
after
the
holy
ceremony
was
performed
the
bishop
turned
and
blessed
him
and
while
an
anthem
was
singing
who
was
still
kneeling
submitted
his
head
to
the
hands
of
a
father
who
with
a
pair
of
scissors
cut
off
his
delicate
hair
at
which
a
soft
murmur
of
pity
and
grief
filled
the
place
those
fine
locks
with
which
had
a
thousand
times
played
and
wound
the
curls
about
her
snowy
fingers
she
now
had
the
dying
grief
for
her
sake
for
her
infidelity
to
behold
sacrificed
to
her
cruelty
and
distributed
among
the
ladies
who
at
any
price
would
purchase
a
curl
after
this
they
took
off
his
linen
and
his
coat
under
which
he
had
a
white
satin
waistcoat
and
under
his
breeches
drawers
of
the
same
then
the
bishop
took
his
robes
which
lay
consecrated
on
the
altar
and
put
them
on
and
invested
him
with
the
holy
robe
the
singing
continuing
to
the
end
of
the
ceremony
where
after
an
anthem
was
sung
while
he
prostrated
himself
before
the
altar
he
arose
and
instead
of
the
two
noblemen
that
attended
him
to
the
altar
two
approached
and
conducted
him
from
it
to
the
seats
of
every
one
of
the
order
whom
he
kissed
and
embraced
as
they
came
forth
to
welcome
him
to
the
society
it
was
with
abundance
of
tears
that
every
one
beheld
this
transformation
but
swooned
several
times
during
the
ceremony
yet
would
not
suffer
herself
to
be
carried
out
but
and
another
young
lady
of
the
house
where
she
lodged
that
accompanied
her
did
what
they
could
to
conceal
her
from
the
public
view
for
my
part
i
swear
i
was
never
so
affected
in
my
life
with
any
thing
as
i
was
at
this
ceremony
nor
ever
found
my
heart
so
oppressed
with
tenderness
and
was
myself
ready
to
sink
where
i
sat
when
he
came
near
me
to
be
welcomed
by
a
father
that
sat
next
to
me
after
this
he
was
led
by
two
of
the
eldest
fathers
to
his
apartment
and
left
a
thousand
sighing
hearts
behind
him
had
he
died
there
had
not
been
half
that
lamentation
so
foolish
is
the
mistaken
world
to
grieve
at
our
happiest
fortune
either
when
we
go
to
heaven
or
retreat
from
this
world
which
has
nothing
in
it
that
can
really
charm
without
a
thousand
fatigues
to
attend
it
and
in
this
retreat
i
am
sure
he
himself
was
the
only
person
that
was
not
infinitely
concerned
who
quitted
the
world
with
so
modest
a
bravery
so
entire
a
joy
as
no
young
conqueror
ever
performed
his
triumphs
with
more
the
ceremony
being
ended
got
to
her
chair
concerned
even
to
death
and
she
vowed
afterwards
she
had
much
ado
to
herself
from
running
and
seizing
him
at
the
altar
and
preventing
his
fortune
and
design
but
that
she
believed
would
have
resented
it
to
the
last
degree
and
possibly
have
made
it
fatal
to
both
herself
and
it
was
a
great
while
before
she
could
recover
from
the
indisposition
to
which
this
fatal
and
unexpected
accident
had
reduced
her
but
as
i
have
said
she
was
not
of
a
nature
to
die
for
love
and
charming
and
brave
as
was
it
was
perhaps
her
interest
and
the
loss
of
his
considerable
fortune
that
gave
her
the
greatest
cause
of
grief
sometimes
she
vainly
fancied
that
yet
her
power
was
such
that
with
the
expense
of
one
visit
and
some
of
her
usual
arts
which
rarely
fail
she
had
power
to
withdraw
his
thoughts
from
heaven
and
fix
them
all
on
herself
again
and
to
make
him
fly
those
enclosures
to
her
more
agreeable
arms
but
again
she
wisely
considered
though
he
might
be
retrieved
his
fortune
was
disposed
of
to
holy
uses
and
could
never
be
so
this
last
thought
more
prevailed
upon
her
and
had
more
convincing
reason
in
it
than
all
that
could
besides
oppose
her
flame
for
she
had
this
wretched
prudence
even
in
the
highest
flights
and
passions
of
her
love
to
have
a
wise
regard
to
interest
insomuch
that
it
is
most
certain
she
refused
to
give
herself
up
entirely
even
to
him
whom
one
would
have
thought
nothing
but
perfect
love
soft
irresistible
love
could
have
compelled
her
to
have
transgressed
withal
when
so
many
reasons
contradicted
her
passion
how
much
more
then
ought
we
to
believe
that
interest
was
the
greatest
motive
of
all
her
however
this
powerful
motive
failed
not
to
beget
in
her
all
the
pains
and
melancholies
that
the
most
violent
of
passions
could
do
but
who
loved
her
to
a
greater
degree
than
ever
strove
all
he
could
to
divert
the
thoughts
of
a
grief
for
which
there
was
no
remedy
and
believed
if
he
could
get
her
out
of
retired
to
the
little
town
or
rather
village
where
he
was
first
made
happy
and
where
still
believed
her
to
be
he
should
again
that
power
over
her
heart
he
had
before
in
this
melancholy
fit
of
hers
he
proposed
it
urging
the
danger
he
should
be
in
for
obeying
her
should
once
come
to
know
that
she
was
in
and
that
possibly
she
would
not
find
so
civil
a
treatment
as
he
ought
to
pay
her
if
he
should
come
to
the
knowledge
of
it
besides
these
reasons
he
said
he
had
some
of
greater
importance
which
he
must
not
discover
till
she
were
withdrawn
from
but
there
needed
not
much
to
persuade
her
to
retire
in
the
humour
she
then
was
and
with
no
opposition
on
her
side
she
told
him
she
was
ready
to
go
where
he
thought
fit
and
accordingly
the
next
day
they
departed
the
town
and
in
three
more
arrived
to
the
village
in
all
this
journey
never
approached
her
but
with
all
the
respect
imaginable
but
withal
with
abundance
of
silent
passion
which
manner
of
carriage
obliged
very
often
to
take
notice
of
it
with
great
satisfaction
and
signs
of
favour
and
as
he
saw
her
melancholy
abate
he
increased
in
sighing
and
lover
s
boldnesses
yet
with
all
this
he
could
not
oblige
her
to
those
returns
he
wished
when
after
ten
days
stay
writ
to
him
to
inquire
of
his
health
and
of
to
whom
he
sent
a
very
kind
letter
but
no
more
of
the
lover
than
if
there
had
never
been
such
a
joy
between
them
he
begged
her
to
take
care
of
herself
and
told
her
he
would
be
with
her
in
ten
or
fifteen
days
and
desired
her
to
send
him
if
he
were
not
wholly
necessary
to
her
service
for
he
had
urgent
affairs
to
employ
him
in
so
that
not
being
able
longer
with
any
colour
to
defend
his
stay
writ
him
word
he
would
wait
on
him
in
two
days
which
short
time
he
wholly
employed
in
the
utmost
endeavour
to
gain
favour
but
she
whose
thoughts
were
roving
on
new
designs
which
she
thought
fit
to
conceal
from
a
lover
still
put
him
off
with
pretended
illness
and
thoughtfulness
on
the
late
melancholy
object
and
loss
of
but
assured
him
as
soon
as
she
was
recovered
of
that
pressure
she
would
receive
him
with
the
same
joy
she
had
before
and
which
his
person
and
his
services
merited
from
her
it
was
thus
she
soothed
the
hoping
lover
who
went
away
with
all
the
satisfaction
imaginable
bearing
a
letter
from
to
written
with
all
the
art
of
flattery
was
no
sooner
gone
but
whose
head
ran
on
new
adventures
resolved
to
try
her
chance
and
being
whenever
she
pleased
of
a
humour
very
gay
she
resolved
upon
a
design
in
which
she
could
trust
no
body
but
her
page
who
loved
his
lady
to
the
last
degree
of
passion
though
he
never
durst
shew
it
even
in
his
looks
or
sighs
and
yet
the
cunning
had
by
chance
found
his
flame
and
would
often
take
delight
to
torture
the
poor
youth
to
laugh
at
him
she
knew
he
would
die
to
serve
her
and
she
durst
trust
him
with
the
most
important
business
of
her
life
she
therefore
the
next
morning
sends
for
him
to
her
chamber
which
she
often
did
and
told
him
her
design
which
was
in
man
s
clothes
to
go
back
to
and
see
if
they
could
find
any
adventures
by
the
way
that
might
be
worth
the
journey
and
divert
them
she
told
him
she
would
trust
him
with
all
her
secrets
and
he
vowed
fidelity
she
bid
him
bring
her
a
suit
of
those
clothes
she
used
to
wear
at
her
first
arrival
at
and
he
looked
out
one
very
fine
and
which
she
had
worn
that
day
she
went
to
have
been
married
to
when
the
messengers
took
her
up
for
a
spy
a
suit
had
never
seen
she
equips
herself
and
leaving
in
charge
with
what
to
say
in
her
absence
and
telling
her
she
was
going
upon
a
frolic
to
divert
herself
a
day
or
two
she
accompanied
by
her
page
only
took
horse
and
made
away
towards
you
must
know
that
the
stage
is
a
very
small
village
in
which
there
is
most
lamentable
accommodation
and
may
vie
with
any
part
of
for
bad
inns
not
used
much
to
riding
as
a
man
was
pretty
well
tired
by
that
time
she
got
to
one
of
those
and
as
soon
as
she
alighted
she
went
to
her
chamber
to
refresh
and
cool
herself
and
while
the
page
was
gone
to
the
kitchen
to
see
what
there
was
to
eat
she
was
leaning
out
of
the
window
and
looking
on
the
passengers
that
rode
along
many
of
which
took
up
in
the
same
house
among
them
that
alighted
there
was
a
very
handsome
young
gentleman
appearing
of
quality
attended
only
by
his
page
she
considered
this
person
a
little
more
than
the
rest
and
finding
him
so
unaccompanied
had
a
curiosity
natural
to
her
to
know
who
he
was
she
ran
to
another
window
that
looked
into
the
yard
a
kind
of
balcony
and
saw
him
alight
and
look
at
her
and
saluted
her
in
passing
into
the
kitchen
seeing
her
look
like
a
youth
of
quality
coming
in
he
saw
her
page
and
asked
if
he
belonged
to
that
young
cavalier
in
the
gallery
the
page
told
him
he
did
and
being
asked
who
he
was
he
told
him
he
was
a
young
nobleman
of
a
stranger
to
all
those
parts
and
had
made
an
escape
from
his
tutors
and
said
he
was
of
a
humour
never
to
be
out
of
his
way
all
places
being
alike
to
him
in
those
little
adventures
so
leaving
him
with
yet
a
greater
curiosity
he
ran
to
and
told
her
what
had
passed
between
the
young
stranger
and
him
while
she
who
was
possessed
with
the
same
inquisitive
humour
bid
him
inquire
who
he
was
when
the
master
of
the
coming
in
the
interim
up
to
usher
in
her
supper
she
inquired
of
him
who
that
young
stranger
was
he
told
her
one
of
the
greatest
persons
in
that
he
was
nephew
to
the
governor
and
who
had
a
very
great
equipage
at
other
times
but
that
now
he
was
being
on
an
intrigue
this
intrigue
gave
new
curiosity
and
hoping
the
master
would
tell
him
again
she
fell
into
great
praises
of
his
beauty
and
his
mien
which
for
several
reasons
pleased
the
man
of
the
inn
who
departed
with
the
good
news
and
told
every
word
of
it
to
the
young
cavalier
the
good
man
having
besides
the
pleasing
him
with
the
grateful
compliments
a
farther
design
in
the
relation
for
his
house
being
very
full
of
persons
of
all
sorts
he
had
no
lodgings
for
the
governor
s
nephew
unless
he
could
recommend
him
to
our
young
cavalier
the
gay
unknown
extremely
pleased
with
the
character
he
had
given
him
by
so
beautiful
a
gentleman
and
one
who
appeared
of
so
much
quality
being
alone
and
knowing
he
was
so
also
sent
a
page
that
spoke
very
good
and
had
a
handsome
address
and
quick
wit
to
make
his
compliment
to
the
young
which
was
to
beg
to
be
admitted
to
sup
with
him
who
readily
accepted
the
honour
as
she
called
it
and
the
young
governor
whom
we
must
call
for
a
reason
or
two
immediately
after
entered
her
chamber
with
an
admirable
address
appearing
much
handsomer
near
than
at
a
distance
though
even
then
he
drew
eyes
with
admiration
on
him
there
were
a
thousand
young
graces
in
his
person
sweetnesses
in
his
face
love
and
fire
in
his
eyes
and
wit
on
his
tongue
his
stature
was
neither
tall
nor
low
very
well
made
and
fashioned
a
hair
hazel
eyes
and
a
very
soft
and
amorous
air
about
twenty
years
of
age
he
spoke
very
good
and
after
the
first
compliments
on
either
side
were
over
as
on
such
occasions
are
necessary
in
which
on
both
sides
were
nothing
but
great
expressions
of
esteem
began
so
very
well
to
be
pleased
with
the
fair
stranger
that
she
had
like
to
have
forgot
the
part
she
was
to
act
and
have
made
discoveries
of
her
sex
by
addressing
herself
with
the
modesty
and
blushes
of
a
woman
but
who
had
no
such
apprehension
though
she
appeared
with
much
more
beauty
than
he
fancied
ever
to
have
seen
in
a
man
nevertheless
admired
without
suspecting
and
took
all
those
signs
of
effeminacy
to
unassured
youth
and
first
address
and
he
was
absolutely
deceived
in
her
supper
being
brought
up
which
was
the
best
the
bad
inn
afforded
they
sat
down
and
all
the
supper
time
talked
of
a
thousand
pleasant
things
and
most
of
love
and
women
where
both
expressed
abundance
of
gallantry
for
the
fair
sex
related
many
short
and
pleasant
accidents
and
amours
he
had
had
with
women
though
the
stranger
were
by
birth
a
yet
while
they
discoursed
the
glass
was
not
idle
but
went
as
briskly
about
as
if
had
been
an
absolute
good
fellow
drinks
his
and
his
mistress
s
health
and
returned
the
civility
and
so
on
till
three
bottles
were
sacrificed
to
love
and
good
humour
while
she
at
the
expense
of
a
little
modesty
declared
herself
so
much
of
the
opinion
of
for
gay
inconstancy
and
the
blessing
of
variety
that
he
was
wholly
charmed
with
a
conversation
so
agreeable
to
his
own
i
have
heard
her
page
say
from
whom
i
have
had
a
great
part
of
the
truths
of
her
life
that
he
never
saw
in
so
pleasant
a
humour
all
his
life
before
nor
seemed
so
well
pleased
which
gave
him
her
lover
a
jealousy
that
perplexed
him
above
any
thing
he
had
ever
felt
from
love
though
he
durst
not
own
it
but
finding
his
young
companion
altogether
so
charming
and
in
his
own
way
too
could
not
forbear
very
often
from
falling
upon
his
neck
and
kissing
the
fair
disguised
with
as
hearty
an
ardour
as
ever
he
did
one
of
the
other
sex
he
told
her
he
adored
her
she
was
directly
of
his
principle
all
gay
inconstant
galliard
and
roving
and
with
such
a
gusto
he
commended
the
joys
of
fickle
youth
that
would
often
say
she
was
then
jealous
of
him
and
envious
of
those
who
possessed
him
though
she
knew
not
whom
the
more
she
looked
on
him
and
heard
him
speak
the
more
she
fancied
him
and
wine
that
warmed
her
head
made
her
give
him
a
thousand
demonstrations
of
love
that
warmed
her
heart
which
he
mistook
for
friendship
having
mistaken
her
sex
in
this
fit
of
beginning
love
which
is
always
the
best
and
jealousy
she
bethought
her
to
ask
him
on
what
adventure
he
had
now
been
for
he
being
without
his
equipage
she
believed
she
said
he
was
upon
some
affair
of
love
he
told
her
there
was
a
lady
within
an
hour
s
riding
of
that
place
of
quality
and
handsome
very
much
courted
amongst
those
that
were
of
the
number
of
her
adorers
he
said
was
a
young
man
of
quality
of
who
called
himself
this
had
been
about
eight
days
very
happy
in
her
favour
and
had
happened
to
boast
his
good
fortune
the
next
night
at
the
governor
s
table
where
he
dined
with
the
prince
i
told
him
continued
that
the
person
he
so
boasted
of
had
so
soon
granted
him
the
favour
that
i
believed
she
was
of
a
humour
to
suffer
none
to
die
at
her
feet
but
this
said
he
thought
an
indignity
to
his
good
parts
and
told
me
he
believed
he
was
the
only
man
happy
in
her
favour
and
that
could
be
so
on
this
i
ventured
a
wager
at
which
he
coloured
extremely
and
the
company
laughed
which
incensed
him
more
the
prince
urged
the
wager
which
was
a
pair
of
horses
the
best
in
the
court
on
my
side
against
a
discretion
on
his
this
odds
offered
by
me
incensed
him
yet
more
but
urged
to
lay
we
ended
the
dispute
with
the
wager
the
best
conclusion
of
all
controversies
he
would
have
known
what
measures
i
would
take
i
refused
to
satisfy
him
in
that
i
only
swore
him
upon
honour
that
he
should
not
discover
the
wager
or
the
dispute
to
the
lady
the
next
day
i
went
to
pay
her
a
visit
from
my
aunt
the
governor
s
lady
and
she
received
me
with
all
the
civility
in
the
world
i
seemed
surprised
at
her
beauty
and
could
talk
of
nothing
but
the
adoration
i
had
for
her
and
found
her
extremely
pleased
and
vain
of
which
feeble
resistance
i
made
so
good
advantage
that
before
we
parted
being
all
alone
i
received
from
her
all
the
freedoms
that
i
could
with
any
good
manners
be
allowed
the
first
time
she
firing
me
with
kisses
and
suffering
my
closest
embraces
having
prospered
so
well
i
left
her
for
that
time
and
two
days
after
i
made
my
visit
again
she
was
a
married
lady
and
her
husband
was
a
count
and
gone
to
a
little
government
he
held
under
my
uncle
so
that
again
i
found
a
free
admittance
i
told
her
it
was
my
aunt
s
compliment
i
brought
before
but
that
now
it
was
my
own
i
brought
which
was
that
of
an
impatient
heart
that
burnt
with
a
world
of
fire
and
flame
and
nonsense
in
fine
so
eager
i
was
and
so
pressing
for
something
more
than
dull
kissing
that
she
began
to
retire
as
fast
as
she
advanced
before
and
told
me
after
abundance
of
pressing
her
to
it
that
she
had
set
a
price
upon
her
beauty
and
unless
i
understood
how
to
purchase
her
it
was
not
her
fault
if
i
were
not
happy
at
first
i
so
little
expected
it
had
been
money
that
i
reiterated
my
vows
and
fancied
it
was
the
assurance
of
my
heart
she
meant
but
she
very
frankly
replied
sir
you
may
spare
your
pains
and
five
hundred
pistoles
will
ease
you
of
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
be
the
best
argument
of
your
this
generous
conscientious
humour
of
hers
of
suffering
none
to
die
that
had
five
hundred
pistoles
to
present
for
a
cure
was
very
good
news
to
me
and
i
found
i
was
not
at
all
obliged
to
my
youth
or
beauty
but
that
a
man
with
half
a
nose
or
a
single
eye
or
that
stunk
like
an
old
that
had
dined
on
rotten
cheese
and
garlic
should
have
been
equally
as
welcome
for
the
aforesaid
sum
to
this
charming
insensible
i
must
confess
i
do
not
love
to
chaffer
for
my
pleasure
it
takes
off
the
best
part
of
it
and
were
i
left
to
my
own
judgement
of
its
worth
i
should
hardly
have
offered
so
sneaking
a
sum
but
that
sort
of
bargaining
was
her
humour
and
to
enjoy
her
mind
though
she
had
strangely
palled
me
by
this
management
of
the
matter
all
i
had
now
to
do
was
to
appoint
my
night
and
bring
my
money
now
was
a
very
proper
time
for
it
her
husband
being
absent
i
took
my
leave
of
her
infinitely
well
pleased
to
have
gained
my
point
on
any
terms
with
a
promise
to
deliver
myself
there
the
next
night
but
she
told
me
she
had
a
brother
to
come
whom
she
would
not
have
see
me
and
for
that
reason
being
however
not
willing
to
delay
the
receiving
her
pistoles
she
desired
i
would
wait
at
this
very
house
till
a
footman
should
give
me
notice
when
to
come
accordingly
i
came
and
sent
her
a
billet
that
i
waited
prepared
at
all
points
and
she
returned
me
a
billet
to
this
purpose
that
her
brother
with
some
relations
being
arrived
as
she
expected
she
begged
for
her
honour
s
sake
that
i
would
wait
till
she
sent
which
should
be
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
to
their
chambers
and
they
having
rid
a
long
journey
would
early
retire
that
she
was
impatient
of
the
blessing
and
should
be
as
well
prepared
as
himself
and
that
she
would
leave
her
woman
to
give
me
this
satisfied
me
very
well
and
as
i
attended
her
some
of
my
acquaintance
chanced
to
arrive
with
whom
i
supped
and
took
so
many
glasses
to
her
health
as
it
passed
down
that
i
was
arrived
at
a
very
handsome
pitch
and
to
say
truth
was
as
full
of
as
of
however
as
soon
as
her
footman
arrived
i
stole
away
and
took
horse
and
by
that
time
it
was
quite
dark
arrived
at
her
house
where
i
was
led
in
by
a
young
maid
whose
habit
was
very
neat
and
clean
and
she
herself
appeared
to
my
eyes
then
dazzling
with
wine
the
most
beautiful
young
creature
i
had
ever
seen
as
in
truth
she
was
she
seemed
all
modesty
and
blushing
innocence
so
that
conducting
me
into
a
low
parlour
while
she
went
to
tell
her
lady
i
was
come
who
lay
ready
dressed
in
all
the
magnificences
of
to
receive
me
i
sat
contemplating
on
this
fair
young
maid
and
no
more
thought
of
her
lady
than
of
the
maid
soon
returned
and
curtseying
told
me
with
blushes
on
her
face
that
her
lady
expected
me
the
house
was
still
as
sleep
and
no
noise
heard
but
the
little
winds
that
rushed
among
the
jessamine
that
grew
at
the
window
now
whether
at
that
moment
the
false
light
in
the
room
or
the
true
wine
deceived
me
i
know
not
but
i
beheld
this
maid
as
an
angel
for
beauty
and
indeed
i
think
she
had
all
the
temptations
of
nature
i
began
to
kiss
her
and
she
to
tremble
and
blush
yet
not
so
much
out
of
fear
as
surprise
and
shame
at
my
address
i
found
her
pleased
with
my
vows
and
melting
at
my
kisses
i
sighed
in
her
bosom
which
panted
me
a
welcome
there
that
bosom
whiter
than
snow
sweeter
than
the
nosegay
she
had
planted
there
she
urged
me
faintly
to
go
to
her
lady
who
expected
me
and
i
swore
it
was
for
her
sake
i
came
whom
i
never
saw
and
that
i
scorned
all
other
beauties
she
kindled
at
this
and
her
cheeks
glowed
with
love
i
pressed
her
to
all
i
wished
but
she
replied
she
was
a
maid
and
should
be
undone
i
told
her
i
would
marry
her
and
swore
it
with
a
thousand
oaths
she
believed
and
grew
prettily
fond
in
fine
at
last
she
yielded
to
all
i
asked
of
her
which
we
had
scarce
recovered
when
her
lady
rung
i
could
not
stir
but
she
who
feared
a
surprise
ran
to
her
and
told
her
i
was
gone
into
the
garden
and
would
come
immediately
she
hastens
down
again
to
me
fires
me
anew
and
pleased
me
anew
it
was
thus
i
taught
a
longing
maid
the
first
lesson
of
sin
at
the
price
of
fifty
pistoles
which
i
presented
her
nor
could
i
yet
part
from
this
young
charmer
but
stayed
so
long
that
her
lady
rung
a
silver
bell
again
but
my
new
prize
was
so
wholly
taken
up
with
the
pleasure
of
this
new
amour
and
the
good
fortune
arrived
to
her
she
heard
not
the
bell
so
that
the
fair
deceived
put
on
her
and
slippers
and
came
softly
down
stairs
and
found
my
new
love
and
i
closely
embracing
with
all
the
passion
and
fondness
imaginable
i
know
not
what
she
saw
in
me
in
that
kind
moment
to
her
woman
or
whether
the
disappointment
gave
her
a
greater
desire
but
it
is
most
certain
she
fell
most
desperately
in
love
with
me
and
scorning
to
take
notice
of
the
indignity
i
put
upon
her
she
unseen
stole
to
her
chamber
where
after
a
most
afflicting
night
she
next
morning
called
her
woman
to
her
whom
i
left
towards
morning
better
pleased
with
my
fifty
pistoles
worth
of
beauty
than
i
should
have
been
with
that
of
five
hundred
the
maid
whose
guilt
made
her
very
much
unassured
approached
her
lady
with
such
tremblings
as
she
no
longer
doubted
but
she
was
guilty
but
durst
not
examine
her
about
it
lest
she
who
had
her
honour
in
keeping
should
by
the
discovery
she
found
she
had
made
of
her
levity
expose
that
of
her
lady
she
therefore
dissembled
as
well
as
she
could
and
examined
her
about
my
stay
to
which
the
maid
answered
i
had
fallen
asleep
and
it
was
impossible
to
awake
me
till
day
appeared
when
for
fear
of
discovery
i
posted
away
this
though
the
lady
knew
was
false
she
was
forced
to
take
for
current
excuse
and
more
raging
with
love
than
ever
she
immediately
dispatched
away
her
footman
with
a
letter
to
me
upbraiding
me
extremely
but
at
the
same
time
inviting
me
with
all
the
passion
imaginable
and
because
i
should
not
again
see
my
young
mistress
who
was
dying
in
love
with
me
she
appointed
me
to
meet
her
at
a
little
house
she
had
a
from
her
own
where
was
a
fine
decoy
and
a
great
number
of
kept
which
her
husband
took
great
delight
in
there
i
was
to
wait
her
coming
where
lived
only
a
man
and
his
old
wife
her
servants
i
was
very
glad
of
this
invitation
and
went
she
came
adorned
with
all
her
charms
i
considered
her
a
new
woman
and
one
whom
i
had
a
wager
to
win
upon
the
conquest
of
one
i
had
inclination
to
till
by
the
discovery
of
the
jilt
in
her
i
began
to
despise
the
beauty
however
as
i
said
she
was
new
and
now
perhaps
easy
to
be
brought
to
any
terms
as
indeed
it
happened
she
caressed
me
with
all
imaginable
fondness
was
ready
to
eat
my
lips
instead
of
kissing
them
and
much
more
forward
than
i
wished
who
do
not
love
an
conquest
however
she
pleased
me
for
three
days
together
in
all
which
time
she
detained
me
there
coming
to
me
early
and
staying
the
latest
hour
and
i
have
no
reason
to
repent
my
time
for
besides
that
i
have
passed
it
very
well
she
at
my
coming
away
presented
me
this
jewel
in
my
hat
and
this
ring
on
my
finger
and
i
have
saved
my
five
hundred
pistoles
my
heart
and
my
credit
in
the
encounter
and
am
going
to
to
triumph
over
the
haughty
conceited
who
set
so
great
a
value
on
his
own
beauty
and
yet
for
all
his
fine
person
has
paid
the
pistoles
before
he
could
purchase
the
blessing
as
she
swore
to
me
who
have
made
a
convert
of
her
and
reduced
her
to
the
thing
she
never
yet
was
a
lover
insomuch
that
she
has
promised
me
to
renounce
i
have
promised
to
visit
her
again
but
if
i
do
it
will
be
more
for
the
vanity
to
please
than
to
be
pleased
for
i
never
repeat
any
thing
with
all
the
while
he
spoke
fixed
her
eyes
and
all
her
soft
desires
upon
him
she
envies
the
happy
countess
but
much
more
the
happy
maid
with
whom
his
perfect
liking
made
him
happy
she
fancies
him
in
her
arms
and
wishes
him
there
she
is
ready
a
thousand
times
to
tell
him
she
is
a
woman
but
when
she
reflects
on
his
inconstancy
she
fears
when
he
had
ended
his
story
she
cried
sighing
and
you
are
just
come
from
this
fair
lady
he
answered
her
he
was
sound
and
heart
whole
she
replied
it
is
very
well
you
are
so
but
all
the
young
do
not
thus
escape
from
beauty
and
you
may
some
time
or
other
be
oh
cried
he
i
defy
the
power
of
one
while
heaven
has
distributed
variety
to
were
you
never
in
love
replied
sylvia
never
said
he
that
they
call
love
i
have
burnt
and
raved
an
hour
or
two
or
so
pursued
and
gazed
and
laid
sieges
till
i
had
overcome
but
what
is
this
to
love
did
i
ever
make
a
second
visit
unless
upon
necessity
or
gratitude
and
yet
and
there
he
sighed
and
yet
said
he
i
saw
a
beauty
once
upon
the
that
has
ever
since
given
me
at
said
there
replied
he
she
was
the
fairest
creature
heaven
ever
made
such
white
and
red
by
nature
such
hair
such
eyes
and
such
a
mouth
all
youth
and
ravishing
sweetness
i
pursued
her
to
her
lodgings
and
all
i
could
get
was
that
she
belonged
to
a
young
nobleman
who
since
has
taken
orders
from
the
night
i
saw
her
i
never
left
her
window
but
had
spies
of
all
sorts
who
brought
me
intelligence
and
a
little
after
i
found
she
had
quitted
the
place
with
a
new
lover
which
made
me
love
and
rave
ten
times
more
when
i
knew
assuredly
she
was
a
whore
and
how
fine
a
one
i
had
this
called
all
the
blood
to
face
and
so
confounded
her
she
could
not
answer
she
knew
it
was
herself
of
whom
he
spoke
and
that
coarse
word
though
innocently
spoken
or
rather
gaily
expressed
put
her
quite
out
of
countenance
however
she
recovered
again
when
she
considered
they
were
not
meant
as
rudenesses
to
her
she
loved
him
and
was
easy
to
pardon
with
such
discourse
they
passed
the
evening
till
towards
and
the
young
who
had
taken
little
rest
in
three
nights
before
wanted
some
repose
and
calling
for
his
chamber
the
host
besought
him
since
they
had
the
happiness
the
young
gentleman
and
himself
to
be
so
good
friends
that
they
would
share
a
bed
together
for
in
truth
said
he
sir
you
must
sit
up
all
night
else
he
replied
with
all
his
soul
it
was
the
most
grateful
proposal
had
been
ever
made
him
and
addressing
himself
to
asked
him
if
he
would
allow
him
that
blessing
she
blushed
extremely
at
the
question
and
hung
down
her
eyes
and
he
laughed
to
see
it
sir
said
i
will
give
you
my
bed
for
it
is
all
one
to
me
to
lie
on
a
bed
or
on
the
why
sir
said
i
am
too
passionate
an
adorer
of
the
female
sex
to
incommode
any
of
my
own
with
addresses
nor
am
i
so
nice
but
i
can
suffer
a
man
to
lie
by
me
especially
so
dear
a
youth
as
yourself
at
which
he
embraced
her
in
his
arms
which
did
but
the
more
raise
blushes
who
wished
for
what
she
dreaded
with
you
sir
said
she
i
could
methinks
be
content
to
do
what
i
do
not
use
to
do
and
fearing
to
betray
her
sex
forced
a
consent
for
either
one
or
the
other
she
was
compelled
to
do
and
with
the
assurance
that
he
thought
her
what
she
seemed
she
chose
to
give
her
consent
and
they
both
went
to
bed
together
to
add
to
her
deceit
she
being
forced
in
her
sickness
to
cut
off
her
hair
when
she
put
off
her
periwig
she
discovered
nothing
of
the
woman
nor
feared
she
any
thing
but
her
breasts
which
were
the
roundest
and
the
whitest
in
the
world
but
she
was
long
in
undressing
which
to
colour
the
matter
she
suffered
her
page
to
do
who
poor
lad
was
never
in
so
trembling
a
condition
as
in
that
manner
to
be
obliged
to
serve
her
where
she
discovered
so
many
charms
he
never
before
had
seen
but
all
such
as
might
be
seen
with
modesty
by
that
time
she
came
to
bed
was
fast
asleep
being
so
long
kept
waking
and
never
so
much
as
dreamt
he
had
a
woman
with
him
but
she
whose
fears
kept
her
waking
had
a
thousand
agitations
and
wishes
so
natural
it
is
when
virtue
has
broke
the
bounds
of
modesty
to
plunge
in
past
all
retreat
and
i
believe
there
are
very
few
who
retire
after
the
first
sin
she
considers
her
condition
in
a
strange
country
her
splendour
declining
her
love
for
quite
reduced
to
friendship
or
hardly
that
she
was
young
and
ate
and
drank
well
had
a
world
of
vanity
that
food
of
desire
that
fuel
to
vice
she
saw
this
the
beautifullest
youth
she
imagined
ever
to
have
seen
of
quality
and
fortune
able
to
serve
her
all
these
made
her
rave
with
a
desire
to
gain
him
for
a
lover
and
she
imagined
as
all
the
vain
and
young
do
that
though
no
charms
had
yet
been
able
to
hold
him
she
alone
had
those
that
would
her
glass
had
a
thousand
times
told
her
so
she
compares
him
to
and
finds
him
in
her
opinion
handsomer
she
was
possessed
with
some
love
for
when
he
first
addressed
to
her
and
shared
at
best
but
half
a
heart
but
now
that
she
had
lost
all
for
and
and
had
a
heart
to
cast
away
or
give
a
new
lover
it
was
like
her
money
she
hated
to
keep
it
and
lavished
it
on
any
trifle
rather
than
hoard
it
or
let
it
lie
by
it
was
a
loss
of
time
her
youth
could
not
spare
she
after
reflection
resolved
and
when
she
had
resolved
she
believed
it
done
by
a
candle
she
had
by
her
to
read
a
little
novel
she
had
brought
she
surveyed
him
often
as
curiously
as
did
her
and
though
he
slept
like
a
mere
mortal
he
appeared
as
charming
to
her
eyes
as
the
winged
god
himself
and
it
is
believed
she
wished
he
would
awake
and
find
by
her
curiosity
her
sex
for
this
i
know
she
durst
no
longer
trust
herself
with
him
but
got
up
and
all
the
last
part
of
the
night
walked
about
the
room
her
page
lay
in
the
room
with
her
by
her
order
on
the
table
with
a
little
valise
under
his
head
which
he
carried
linen
in
she
awoke
him
and
told
him
all
her
fears
in
a
pleasant
manner
in
the
morning
awakes
and
wonders
to
find
her
up
so
soon
and
reproached
her
for
the
unkindness
new
protestations
on
both
sides
passing
of
eternal
friendship
they
both
resolved
for
but
lest
she
should
encounter
on
the
way
who
possibly
might
be
on
visiting
his
countess
she
desired
him
to
ride
on
before
and
to
suffer
her
to
lose
the
happiness
of
his
company
till
they
met
in
with
much
ado
he
consents
and
taking
the
ring
the
countess
gave
him
from
off
his
finger
sir
said
he
be
pleased
to
wear
this
and
if
ever
you
need
my
fortune
or
my
sword
send
it
and
in
what
part
of
the
world
soever
i
am
i
will
fly
to
your
returned
him
a
little
ring
set
round
with
diamonds
that
philander
in
his
wooing
time
had
given
her
amongst
a
thousand
of
finer
value
his
name
and
hers
were
engraven
instead
of
a
posie
in
it
which
was
only
and
and
which
he
took
no
notice
of
and
parted
from
each
other
in
the
tenderest
manner
that
two
young
gentlemen
could
possibly
be
imagined
to
do
though
it
were
more
than
so
on
her
side
for
she
was
madly
in
love
with
him
as
soon
as
came
to
she
sent
in
the
evening
to
search
out
for
she
had
discovered
if
he
should
come
to
the
knowledge
of
her
being
in
town
and
she
should
not
send
to
him
he
would
take
it
so
very
ill
that
he
might
prevent
all
her
designs
and
rambles
the
now
joy
of
her
heart
she
knew
she
could
make
him
her
slave
her
pimp
her
any
thing
for
love
and
the
hope
of
her
favour
and
his
interest
might
defend
her
and
she
should
know
all
motions
whom
now
though
she
loved
no
more
she
feared
she
found
him
and
he
took
her
lodgings
infinitely
pleased
at
the
trust
she
reposed
in
him
the
only
means
by
which
he
could
arrive
to
happiness
she
continues
her
man
s
habit
and
he
supplied
the
place
of
dressed
her
and
undressed
her
shifted
her
linen
every
day
nor
did
he
take
all
these
freedoms
without
advancing
a
little
farther
upon
occasion
and
opportunity
which
was
the
hire
she
gave
him
to
serve
her
in
more
lucky
amours
the
fine
she
paid
to
live
free
and
at
ease
she
tells
him
her
adventure
which
though
it
were
daggers
to
his
heart
was
however
the
only
way
to
keep
her
his
own
for
he
knew
her
spirit
was
too
violent
to
be
restrained
by
any
means
at
last
she
told
him
her
design
upon
a
certain
young
man
of
quality
who
she
told
him
was
the
same
she
encountered
she
assured
him
it
was
not
love
or
liking
but
perfectly
interest
that
made
her
design
upon
him
and
that
if
he
would
assist
her
she
would
be
very
kind
to
him
as
a
man
that
had
gained
very
greatly
upon
her
heart
this
flattery
she
urged
with
infinite
fondness
and
art
and
he
overjoyed
believed
every
word
as
gospel
so
that
he
promised
her
the
next
day
to
carry
a
billet
to
the
young
in
the
mean
time
she
caused
him
to
sup
with
her
purposely
to
give
him
an
account
of
and
whom
she
heard
was
come
to
and
lived
publicly
with
the
prince
he
told
her
it
was
very
true
and
that
he
saw
them
every
day
nay
every
moment
together
for
he
verily
believed
they
could
not
live
asunder
that
was
every
evening
caballing
there
where
all
the
malcontents
of
the
reformed
religion
had
taken
sanctuary
and
where
the
grand
council
was
every
night
held
for
some
great
things
were
in
agitation
and
debating
how
to
trouble
the
repose
of
all
again
with
new
broils
he
told
her
that
all
the
world
made
their
court
to
that
if
any
body
had
any
petitions
or
addresses
to
make
to
the
prince
it
was
by
her
sole
interest
she
sat
in
their
closest
councils
and
heard
their
gravest
debates
and
she
was
the
oracle
of
the
board
the
prince
paying
her
perfect
adoration
while
she
whose
charms
of
youth
were
ended
being
turned
of
thirty
fortified
her
decays
with
all
the
art
her
wit
and
sex
were
capable
of
and
kept
her
illustrious
lover
as
perfectly
her
slave
as
if
she
had
engaged
him
by
all
those
ties
that
fetter
the
most
circumspect
and
totally
subdued
him
to
her
will
who
was
without
exception
the
most
lovely
person
upon
earth
and
though
madam
you
know
him
so
perfectly
well
yet
i
must
tell
you
my
opinion
of
him
he
is
all
the
softer
sex
can
wish
and
ours
admire
he
is
formed
for
love
and
war
and
as
he
is
the
most
amorous
and
wanton
in
courts
he
is
also
the
most
fierce
and
brave
in
field
his
birth
the
most
elevated
his
age
arrived
to
full
blown
man
adorned
with
all
the
spreading
glories
that
charm
the
fair
and
engage
the
world
and
i
have
often
heard
some
of
our
party
say
his
person
gained
him
more
numbers
to
his
side
than
his
cause
or
quality
for
he
understood
all
the
useful
arts
of
popularity
the
gracious
smile
and
bow
and
all
those
cheap
favours
that
so
gain
upon
hearts
and
without
the
expense
of
any
thing
but
ceremony
has
made
the
nation
mad
for
his
interest
who
never
otherwise
obliged
them
and
sure
nothing
is
more
necessary
in
the
great
than
affability
nor
shews
greater
marks
of
grandeur
or
shall
more
eternize
them
than
bowing
to
the
crowd
as
the
maiden
queen
i
have
read
of
in
who
made
herself
idolized
by
that
sole
piece
of
politic
cunning
understanding
well
the
stubborn
yet
good
nature
of
the
people
and
gained
more
upon
them
by
those
little
arts
than
if
she
had
parted
with
all
the
prerogatives
of
her
crown
ah
madam
you
can
not
imagine
what
little
slights
govern
the
whole
universe
and
how
easy
it
is
for
monarchs
to
oblige
this
was
made
to
know
and
there
is
no
one
so
poor
an
object
who
may
not
have
access
to
him
and
whom
he
does
not
send
away
well
pleased
though
he
do
not
grant
what
they
ask
he
dispatches
quickly
which
is
a
grateful
virtue
in
great
men
and
none
ever
espoused
his
interest
that
did
not
find
a
reward
and
a
protection
it
is
true
these
are
all
the
tools
he
is
to
work
with
and
he
stops
at
nothing
that
leads
to
his
ambition
nor
has
he
done
all
that
lies
in
the
power
of
man
only
to
set
all
yet
in
a
flame
but
he
calls
up
the
very
devils
from
hell
to
his
aid
and
there
is
no
man
famed
for
necromancy
to
whom
he
does
not
apply
himself
which
indeed
is
done
by
the
advice
of
who
is
very
much
affected
with
those
sort
of
people
and
puts
a
great
trust
and
confidence
in
them
she
sent
at
great
expense
for
a
conjurer
who
arrived
the
other
day
and
who
is
perpetually
consulting
with
another
of
the
same
sort
a
by
birth
called
he
was
once
in
holy
orders
and
still
is
so
but
all
his
practice
is
the
black
art
and
excellent
in
it
he
is
reported
to
be
undertakes
nothing
without
his
advice
and
as
he
is
absolutely
her
creature
so
his
art
governs
her
and
she
the
prince
she
holds
her
midnight
conferences
with
him
and
as
she
is
very
superstitious
so
she
is
very
learned
and
studies
this
art
taught
by
this
great
master
and
so
far
is
this
glorious
hero
bewitched
with
these
sorcerers
that
he
puts
his
whole
trust
in
these
conjurations
and
charms
and
so
far
they
have
imposed
on
him
that
with
an
enchanted
ointment
which
they
had
prepared
for
him
he
shall
be
invulnerable
though
he
should
face
the
mouth
of
a
cannon
they
have
at
the
earnest
request
of
calculated
his
nativity
and
find
him
born
to
be
a
king
and
that
before
twenty
moons
expire
he
shall
be
crowned
in
and
flattering
his
easy
youth
with
all
the
vanities
of
ambition
they
have
made
themselves
absolutely
useful
to
him
this
being
a
most
inveterate
enemy
to
lets
the
prince
rest
neither
night
nor
day
but
is
still
inspiring
him
with
new
hopes
of
a
crown
and
laying
him
down
all
the
false
arguments
imaginable
to
spur
the
active
spirit
my
lord
is
not
of
the
opinion
yet
seems
to
comply
with
them
in
council
he
laughs
at
all
the
fopperies
of
charms
and
incantations
insomuch
that
he
many
times
angers
the
prince
and
is
in
eternal
little
feuds
with
the
would
often
in
these
disputes
say
he
found
by
his
art
that
the
stop
to
the
prince
s
glory
would
be
his
love
this
so
incensed
and
consequently
the
prince
that
they
had
like
to
have
broke
with
him
but
durst
not
for
fear
he
knowing
too
much
to
be
disobliged
on
the
other
side
is
most
wonderfully
charmed
with
the
wit
and
masculine
spirit
of
her
courage
and
the
manliness
of
her
mind
and
understanding
which
way
she
would
be
served
resolved
to
obey
her
finding
she
had
an
absolute
ascendancy
over
the
prince
whom
by
this
means
he
knew
he
should
get
into
his
sole
management
though
she
seemed
to
be
possessed
so
entirely
of
heart
found
she
had
great
and
powerful
opposers
who
believed
the
prince
lay
idling
in
her
arms
and
that
possibly
she
might
eclipse
his
fame
by
living
at
that
rate
with
a
woman
he
had
no
other
pretensions
to
but
love
and
many
other
motives
were
urged
daily
to
him
by
the
admirers
of
his
great
actions
and
she
feared
with
reason
that
some
time
or
other
ambition
might
get
the
ascendancy
of
love
she
therefore
in
her
midnight
conferences
with
often
urged
him
to
shew
her
that
piece
of
his
art
to
make
a
philtre
to
retain
fleeting
love
and
not
only
keep
a
passion
alive
but
even
revive
it
from
the
dead
she
tells
him
of
her
contract
with
him
she
urges
his
forced
marriage
as
she
was
pleased
to
call
it
in
his
youth
and
that
he
being
so
young
she
believed
he
might
find
it
lawful
to
marry
himself
a
second
time
that
possibly
his
princess
was
for
the
interest
of
the
king
and
men
of
his
elevated
fortune
ought
not
to
be
tied
to
those
strictnesses
of
common
men
but
for
the
good
of
the
public
sometimes
act
beyond
the
musty
rules
of
law
and
equity
those
politic
bands
to
confine
the
at
this
unreasonable
rate
she
pleads
her
right
to
and
he
hearkens
with
all
attention
and
approves
so
well
all
she
says
that
he
resolves
not
only
to
attach
the
prince
to
her
by
all
the
force
of
the
black
art
but
that
of
necessary
marriage
also
this
pleased
her
to
the
last
degree
and
she
left
him
after
he
had
promised
her
to
bring
her
the
philtre
by
the
morning
for
it
was
that
she
most
urged
the
other
requiring
time
to
argue
with
him
and
work
him
by
degrees
to
it
accordingly
the
next
morning
he
brings
her
a
of
gold
of
rare
infernal
workmanship
wrought
with
a
thousand
charms
of
that
force
that
every
time
the
prince
should
touch
it
and
while
he
but
wore
it
about
him
his
fondness
should
not
only
continue
but
increase
and
he
should
hate
all
womankind
besides
at
least
in
the
way
of
love
and
have
no
power
to
possess
another
woman
though
she
had
all
the
attractions
of
nature
he
tells
her
the
prince
could
never
suspect
so
familiar
a
present
and
for
the
fineness
of
the
work
it
was
a
present
for
a
prince
for
said
he
no
human
art
could
frame
so
rare
a
piece
of
workmanship
that
nine
nights
the
most
delicate
of
the
infernals
were
mixing
the
metal
with
the
most
powerful
of
charms
and
watched
the
critical
minutes
of
the
stars
in
which
to
form
the
mystic
figures
every
one
being
a
spell
upon
the
heart
of
that
unerring
magic
no
mortal
power
could
ever
dissolve
undo
or
the
only
art
now
was
in
giving
it
so
as
to
oblige
him
never
to
part
with
it
and
she
who
had
all
the
cunning
of
her
sex
undertook
for
that
part
she
dismissed
her
infernal
confidant
and
went
to
her
to
dress
her
knowing
well
that
the
prince
would
not
be
long
before
that
he
came
to
her
she
laid
the
down
so
as
he
could
not
avoid
seeing
it
the
prince
came
immediately
after
in
as
he
ever
used
to
do
night
and
morning
to
see
her
dress
her
he
saw
this
gay
thing
on
the
table
and
took
it
in
his
hand
admiring
the
work
of
it
as
he
was
the
most
curious
person
in
the
world
she
told
him
there
was
not
a
finer
wrought
thing
in
the
world
and
that
she
had
a
very
great
esteem
for
it
it
being
made
by
the
and
bid
him
mind
the
antiqueness
of
the
work
the
more
she
commended
it
the
more
he
liked
it
and
told
her
she
must
let
him
call
it
his
she
told
him
he
would
give
it
away
to
the
next
commender
he
vowed
he
would
not
she
told
him
then
he
should
not
only
call
it
his
but
it
should
in
reality
be
so
and
he
vowed
it
should
be
the
last
thing
he
would
part
with
in
the
world
from
that
time
forward
she
found
or
thought
she
found
a
more
impatient
fondness
in
him
than
she
had
seen
before
however
it
was
she
ruled
and
governed
him
as
she
pleased
and
indeed
never
was
so
great
a
slave
to
beauty
as
in
my
opinion
he
was
to
none
at
all
for
she
is
far
from
having
any
natural
charms
yet
it
was
not
long
since
it
was
absolutely
believed
by
all
that
he
had
been
resolved
to
give
himself
wholly
up
to
her
arms
to
have
sought
no
other
glory
than
to
have
retired
to
a
corner
of
the
world
with
her
and
changed
all
his
crown
of
laurel
for
those
of
roses
but
some
stirring
spirits
have
roused
him
anew
and
awakened
ambition
in
him
and
they
are
on
great
designs
which
possibly
ere
long
may
make
all
to
tremble
yet
still
is
oppressed
with
love
and
the
effects
of
daily
increasing
passion
he
has
perpetual
correspondence
with
the
party
in
and
advice
of
all
things
that
pass
they
let
him
know
they
are
ready
to
receive
him
whenever
he
can
bring
a
force
into
nor
needs
he
any
considerable
number
he
having
already
there
in
every
place
through
which
he
shall
pass
all
or
the
most
part
of
the
hearts
and
hands
at
his
devotion
and
they
want
but
arms
and
they
shall
gather
as
they
go
they
desire
he
will
land
himself
in
some
part
of
the
kingdom
and
it
would
be
encouragement
enough
to
all
the
joyful
people
who
will
from
all
parts
flock
together
in
fine
he
is
offered
all
assistance
and
money
and
lest
all
the
forces
of
should
be
bent
against
him
he
has
friends
of
great
quality
and
interest
that
are
resolved
to
rise
in
several
places
of
the
kingdom
in
and
whither
the
king
must
be
obliged
to
send
his
forces
or
a
great
part
of
them
so
that
all
this
side
of
will
be
left
defenceless
i
myself
madam
have
some
share
in
this
great
design
and
possibly
you
will
one
day
see
me
a
person
of
a
quality
sufficient
to
merit
those
favours
i
am
now
blessed
pray
replied
smiling
with
a
little
scorn
what
part
are
you
to
play
to
arrive
at
this
good
fortune
i
am
said
he
trusted
to
provide
all
the
ammunition
and
arms
and
to
hire
a
vessel
to
transport
them
to
some
town
in
which
the
council
shall
think
most
proper
to
receive
laughed
and
said
she
prophesied
another
end
of
this
high
design
than
they
imagined
but
desperate
fortunes
must
take
their
chance
what
continued
she
does
not
speak
of
me
and
inquire
of
me
yes
replied
but
in
such
a
way
as
if
she
looked
on
you
as
a
lost
creature
and
one
of
such
a
reputation
she
would
not
receive
a
visit
from
for
all
the
at
this
laughed
extremely
and
cried
would
be
very
well
content
to
be
so
mean
a
sinner
as
myself
to
be
so
young
and
so
handsome
a
one
however
said
she
be
serious
i
would
be
glad
to
know
what
real
probability
there
is
in
advancing
and
succeeding
in
this
design
for
i
would
take
my
measures
accordingly
and
keep
whose
wavering
or
rather
lost
fortune
is
the
greatest
motive
of
my
resolves
to
part
with
him
and
that
have
made
me
so
uneasy
to
told
her
he
was
very
confident
of
the
design
and
that
it
was
almost
impossible
to
miscarry
in
the
discontent
all
was
in
at
this
juncture
and
they
feared
nothing
but
the
prince
s
relapsing
who
now
most
certainly
preferred
love
to
glory
he
farther
told
her
that
as
they
were
in
council
one
deputed
from
the
arrived
with
new
offers
and
to
know
the
last
result
of
the
prince
whether
he
would
espouse
their
interest
or
not
as
they
were
with
life
and
fortune
ready
to
espouse
his
glory
they
sent
him
word
it
was
from
him
they
expected
liberty
and
him
whom
they
looked
upon
as
their
tutelar
deity
old
was
then
in
council
that
wizard
that
manages
all
and
who
is
ever
at
hand
to
awaken
mischief
alarmed
the
prince
to
new
glories
reproaching
his
scandalous
life
withal
telling
him
there
were
measures
to
be
taken
to
reconcile
love
and
fame
and
which
he
was
to
discourse
to
him
about
in
his
closet
only
but
as
things
were
he
bid
him
look
into
the
story
of
and
and
compare
his
own
with
it
and
he
doubted
not
but
he
would
return
blushing
at
his
remissness
and
sloth
not
that
he
would
exempt
his
youth
from
the
pleasures
of
love
but
he
would
not
have
love
hinder
his
glory
this
bold
speech
before
had
like
to
have
begot
an
ill
understanding
but
she
was
as
much
for
the
prince
s
glory
as
and
therefore
could
not
be
angry
when
she
considered
the
elevation
of
the
prince
would
be
her
own
also
at
this
necessary
reproach
the
prince
blushed
the
board
seconding
the
wizard
had
this
good
effect
to
draw
this
assurance
from
him
that
they
should
see
he
was
not
so
attached
to
love
but
he
could
for
some
time
give
a
cessation
to
his
heart
and
that
the
envoy
from
the
might
return
assured
that
he
would
as
soon
as
he
could
put
his
affairs
in
good
order
come
to
their
relief
and
bring
arms
for
those
that
had
none
with
such
friends
as
he
could
get
together
he
could
not
promise
numbers
lest
by
leading
so
many
here
their
design
should
take
air
but
would
wholly
trust
to
fortune
and
their
good
resolutions
he
demanded
a
sum
of
money
of
them
for
the
buying
these
arms
and
they
have
promised
him
all
aids
this
is
the
last
result
of
council
which
broke
immediately
up
and
the
prince
retired
to
his
closet
where
he
was
no
sooner
come
but
reflecting
on
the
necessity
of
leaving
he
fell
into
the
most
profound
melancholy
and
musing
that
could
seize
a
man
while
he
sat
thus
who
had
schooled
for
his
rough
speech
in
council
and
desired
he
would
now
take
the
opportunity
to
repair
that
want
of
respect
while
the
prince
was
to
be
spoken
to
alone
sent
him
into
the
closet
to
him
where
he
found
him
walking
with
his
arms
not
minding
the
bard
who
stood
gazing
on
him
and
at
last
called
to
him
and
finding
no
reply
he
advanced
and
pulling
him
gently
by
the
arm
cried
awake
royal
young
man
awake
and
look
up
to
coming
greatness
i
was
reflecting
replied
on
all
the
various
fortunes
i
have
passed
from
the
time
of
my
birth
to
this
present
hapless
day
and
would
be
glad
to
know
if
any
supernatural
means
can
tell
me
what
future
events
will
befall
me
if
i
believed
i
should
not
gain
a
crown
by
this
great
enterprise
i
am
undertaking
here
i
would
lay
me
down
in
silent
ease
give
up
my
toils
and
restless
soul
to
love
and
never
think
on
vain
ambition
more
ease
thou
my
troubled
mind
if
thou
hast
any
friend
among
the
infernals
and
they
dare
utter
my
gracious
prince
replied
the
fawning
wizard
this
night
if
you
dare
loose
yourself
from
love
and
come
unattended
to
my
apartment
i
will
undertake
to
shew
you
all
the
future
fortune
you
are
to
run
the
hazards
dangers
and
escapes
that
attend
your
mighty
race
of
life
i
will
lay
the
adamantine
book
before
you
where
all
the
destinies
of
princes
are
hieroglyphick
d
i
will
shew
you
more
if
hell
can
furnish
objects
and
you
dare
stand
untrembling
at
the
terror
of
enough
replied
name
me
the
betwixt
twelve
and
one
said
he
for
that
is
the
sacred
dismal
time
of
night
for
fiends
to
come
tombs
to
open
and
let
loose
their
we
shall
have
use
of
both
no
more
replied
i
will
attend
the
prince
was
going
out
when
recalled
him
and
cried
one
thing
sir
i
must
caution
you
that
from
this
minute
to
that
wherein
i
shall
shew
you
your
destiny
you
commit
nothing
unlawful
with
away
replied
the
prince
smiling
and
leave
your
the
wizard
putting
on
a
more
grave
countenance
replied
by
all
the
infernals
sir
if
you
commit
unlawful
things
i
can
not
serve
if
your
devils
replied
the
prince
laughing
be
so
nice
i
doubt
i
shall
find
them
too
honest
for
my
sir
said
the
subtle
old
fiend
such
conscientious
devils
your
highness
is
to
converse
with
and
if
you
discover
the
secret
it
will
i
not
prove
so
since
they
are
so
humorous
cried
i
will
give
them
way
for
and
going
out
of
the
room
he
went
directly
to
apartment
where
it
being
late
she
is
preparing
for
bed
and
with
a
thousand
kisses
and
hanging
on
his
neck
she
asked
him
why
he
is
so
slow
and
why
he
suffers
not
himself
to
be
undressed
he
feigns
a
thousand
excuses
at
which
she
seems
extremely
amazed
she
complains
reproaches
and
commands
he
tells
her
he
was
to
wait
on
the
governor
about
his
most
urgent
affairs
and
was
late
as
it
was
to
consult
with
him
she
asked
him
what
affairs
he
was
to
negotiate
of
which
she
was
not
to
bear
her
part
he
refuses
to
tell
her
and
she
replied
she
had
sense
and
courage
for
any
enterprise
and
should
resent
it
very
ill
if
she
were
not
made
acquainted
with
it
but
he
swore
i
to
her
she
should
know
all
the
truth
as
soon
as
he
returned
pacified
her
in
some
measure
and
at
the
hour
appointed
she
suffered
him
to
go
and
in
a
chair
was
carried
to
a
little
house
had
taken
without
the
town
to
which
belonged
a
large
garden
at
the
farther
end
of
which
was
a
thicket
of
unordered
trees
that
surrounded
the
grotto
which
i
passed
a
good
way
under
the
ground
it
had
had
some
rarities
of
formerly
belonging
to
it
but
now
they
were
decayed
only
here
and
there
a
broken
rock
let
out
a
little
stream
that
murmured
and
dashed
upon
the
earth
below
and
ran
away
in
a
little
rivulet
which
served
to
add
a
melancholy
to
the
dismal
place
into
this
the
prince
was
conducted
by
the
old
who
assisted
in
the
charm
they
had
only
one
torch
to
light
the
way
which
at
the
entrance
of
the
cave
they
put
out
and
within
was
only
one
glimmering
lamp
that
rather
served
to
add
to
the
horror
of
the
vault
discovering
its
hollowness
and
ruins
at
his
entrance
he
was
saluted
with
a
noise
like
the
rushing
of
wind
which
whizzed
and
whistled
in
the
mighty
concave
anon
a
more
silent
whispering
surrounded
him
without
being
able
to
behold
any
creature
save
the
old
anon
came
in
old
who
rolling
a
great
stone
that
lay
at
one
corner
of
the
cave
he
desired
the
prince
to
place
himself
on
it
and
not
be
surprised
at
any
thing
he
should
behold
nor
to
stir
from
that
enchanted
ground
he
nodding
assented
to
obey
while
and
the
with
each
a
wand
in
their
hands
struck
against
the
unformed
rocks
that
finished
the
end
of
the
cave
muttering
a
thousand
incantations
with
voices
dreadful
and
motions
antic
and
after
a
mighty
stroke
of
thunder
that
shook
the
earth
the
rude
rock
divided
and
opened
a
space
that
discovered
a
most
magnificent
apartment
in
which
was
presented
a
young
hero
attended
with
military
officers
his
pages
dressing
him
for
the
field
all
in
gilded
armour
the
prince
began
to
doubt
himself
and
to
swear
in
his
thought
that
the
apparition
was
himself
so
very
like
he
was
to
himself
as
if
he
had
seen
his
proper
figure
in
a
glass
after
this
several
persons
seemed
to
address
to
this
great
man
of
all
sorts
and
conditions
from
the
prince
to
the
peasant
with
whom
he
seemed
to
discourse
with
great
confidence
and
affability
they
offered
him
the
league
which
he
took
and
signed
and
gave
them
back
they
attend
him
to
the
door
with
great
joy
and
respect
but
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
they
laughed
and
pointed
at
him
at
which
the
prince
infinitely
incensed
rose
and
cried
out
what
means
all
this
s
death
am
i
become
the
scorn
and
mockery
of
the
crowd
besought
him
to
sit
and
have
patience
and
he
obeyed
and
checked
himself
the
scene
of
the
apartment
being
changed
to
an
arbour
of
flowers
and
the
prospect
of
a
noble
and
ravishing
garden
the
hero
is
presented
armed
as
he
was
only
without
his
plume
kneeling
at
the
feet
of
a
fair
woman
in
loose
robes
and
hair
and
attended
with
abundance
of
little
loves
who
disarm
him
by
degrees
of
those
ornaments
of
war
while
she
caresses
him
with
all
the
signs
of
love
the
made
garlands
of
flowers
and
wreath
round
his
arms
and
neck
crowning
his
head
and
fettering
him
all
over
in
these
sweet
soft
chains
they
curl
his
hair
and
adorn
him
with
all
effeminacy
while
he
lies
smiling
and
pleased
the
wanton
boys
disposing
of
his
instruments
of
war
as
they
think
fit
putting
them
to
ridiculous
uses
and
laughing
at
them
while
thus
he
lay
there
enter
to
him
a
great
many
statesmen
and
politicians
grave
men
in
furs
and
chains
attended
by
the
common
crowd
and
opening
a
scene
farther
off
in
prospect
shew
him
crowns
sceptres
globes
ensigns
arms
and
trophies
promiscuously
shuffled
together
with
heaps
of
gold
jewels
parchments
records
charters
and
seals
at
which
sight
he
starts
from
the
arms
of
the
fair
and
strove
to
have
approached
those
who
waited
for
him
but
she
held
him
fast
and
with
abundance
of
tears
and
sighs
of
moving
flattery
brought
him
back
to
her
arms
again
and
all
dissatisfied
the
promiscuous
crowd
depart
some
looking
back
with
scorn
others
with
signs
of
rage
and
all
the
scene
of
glory
of
arms
and
crowns
disappeared
with
the
crowd
wholly
forgetting
cried
out
again
ha
lost
all
for
a
trifling
woman
lost
all
those
trophies
of
thy
conquest
for
a
mistress
by
heaven
i
will
shake
the
charmer
from
my
soul
if
both
i
can
not
when
advancing
to
him
cried
see
sir
how
supinely
the
young
hero
s
laid
upon
her
downy
breast
and
smiled
as
he
spoke
which
angered
the
prince
who
replied
with
scorn
now
by
my
life
a
plot
upon
my
love
but
they
protested
it
was
not
so
and
begged
he
would
be
silent
while
thus
the
hero
lay
regardless
of
his
glory
all
decked
with
flowers
and
bracelets
the
drums
beat
and
the
trumpets
were
heard
or
seemed
to
be
heard
to
sound
and
a
vast
opening
space
was
filled
with
armed
warriors
who
offer
him
their
swords
and
seem
to
point
at
crowns
that
were
borne
behind
them
a
while
they
plead
in
vain
and
point
to
crowns
in
vain
at
which
he
only
casts
a
scornful
smile
and
lays
him
down
in
the
soft
arms
of
love
they
urge
again
but
with
one
amorous
look
the
more
prevails
than
all
their
reasonings
at
last
by
force
they
divested
him
of
his
rosy
garlands
in
which
there
lay
a
charm
and
he
assumes
new
life
while
others
bore
the
enchantress
out
of
his
sight
and
then
he
suffered
himself
to
be
conducted
where
they
pleased
who
led
him
forth
shewing
him
all
the
way
a
prospect
of
crowns
at
this
sighed
and
the
ceremony
continued
scene
changed
discovering
a
where
the
is
represented
landed
but
with
a
very
melancholy
air
attended
with
several
officers
and
gentlemen
the
earth
seems
to
ring
with
joy
and
loud
acclamations
at
his
approach
vast
multitudes
thronging
to
behold
him
and
striving
who
first
should
kiss
his
hand
and
bearing
him
aloft
in
the
air
carry
him
out
of
sight
with
peals
of
welcome
and
joy
is
represented
next
in
council
and
deep
debate
and
so
disappears
then
soft
music
is
heard
and
he
enters
in
the
royal
robe
with
a
crown
presented
him
on
the
knee
which
he
receives
and
bows
to
all
the
rabble
and
the
numbers
to
give
them
thanks
he
having
in
his
hand
blue
garters
with
the
order
of
st
which
he
distributes
to
several
persons
on
either
hand
throwing
ducal
crowns
and
coronets
among
the
rabble
who
scuffle
and
strive
to
catch
at
them
after
a
great
shout
of
joy
thunder
and
lightning
again
shook
the
earth
at
which
they
seemed
all
amazed
when
a
thick
black
cloud
descended
and
covered
the
whole
scene
and
the
rock
closed
again
and
let
fall
his
wand
prince
seeing
the
ceremony
end
here
rises
in
a
rage
and
cries
out
i
charge
you
to
go
on
remove
the
veil
and
let
the
sun
appear
advance
your
mystic
wand
and
shew
what
follows
i
can
not
sir
replied
the
trembling
wizard
the
fates
have
closed
the
everlasting
book
forbidding
farther
then
damn
your
scanted
art
replied
the
prince
a
petty
juggler
could
have
done
as
is
it
not
enough
replied
the
rabbi
that
we
have
shewed
you
crowned
and
crowned
in
itself
i
find
the
infernals
themselves
are
bounded
here
and
can
declare
no
oh
they
are
petty
powers
that
can
be
bounded
replied
the
prince
with
scorn
they
strove
with
all
their
art
to
reconcile
him
laying
the
fault
on
some
mistake
of
theirs
in
the
ingredients
of
the
charm
which
at
another
time
they
would
strive
to
prevent
they
soothe
him
with
all
the
hope
in
the
world
that
what
was
left
unrevealed
must
needs
be
as
glorious
and
fortunate
to
him
as
what
he
had
seen
already
which
was
absolutely
to
be
depended
on
thus
they
brought
him
to
the
open
garden
again
where
they
continued
their
instructions
to
him
telling
him
that
now
was
the
time
to
arrive
at
all
the
glories
he
had
seen
they
presented
to
him
the
state
of
affairs
in
and
how
much
a
greater
interest
he
had
in
the
hearts
of
the
people
than
their
proper
monarch
arguing
a
thousand
fallacies
to
the
deluded
hero
who
blind
and
mad
with
his
dreams
of
glory
his
visions
and
prospects
listened
with
reverence
and
attention
to
all
their
false
persuasions
i
call
them
false
madam
for
i
never
had
faith
in
those
sort
of
people
and
am
sorry
so
many
great
men
and
ladies
of
our
time
are
so
bewitched
to
their
prophecies
they
there
presented
him
with
a
list
of
all
the
considerable
of
the
reformed
religion
in
who
had
assured
him
aids
of
men
and
money
in
this
expedition
merchants
rich
tradesmen
magistrates
and
gownmen
of
the
reformed
church
and
the
law
next
to
this
another
of
the
contribution
of
pious
ladies
all
which
sums
being
named
amounted
to
a
considerable
supply
so
that
they
assured
him
hell
itself
could
not
with
these
aids
obstruct
his
glory
but
on
the
contrary
should
be
compelled
to
render
him
assistance
by
the
help
of
charms
to
make
him
invincible
so
that
wholly
overcome
by
them
he
has
given
order
that
all
preparations
be
forthwith
made
for
the
most
secret
and
speedy
conveyance
of
himself
and
friends
to
some
in
he
has
ordered
abundance
of
letters
to
be
writ
to
those
of
the
party
in
all
parts
of
all
which
will
be
ready
to
assist
him
at
his
landing
undertakes
for
the
management
of
the
whole
affair
to
write
to
speak
and
to
persuade
and
you
know
madam
he
is
the
most
subtle
and
insinuating
of
all
his
race
and
the
most
malignant
of
all
our
party
and
sainted
by
them
for
the
most
pious
and
industrious
labourer
in
the
all
that
he
says
is
oracle
to
the
crowd
and
all
he
says
authentic
and
it
is
he
alone
is
that
great
engine
that
sets
the
great
work
a
yes
replied
and
makes
the
giddy
world
mad
with
his
damnable
pernicious
as
he
is
replied
he
has
the
sole
management
of
affairs
under
he
has
power
to
treat
to
advise
to
raise
money
to
make
and
name
officers
and
lastly
to
draw
out
a
scene
of
fair
pretences
for
to
the
crown
of
and
the
lawfulness
of
his
claim
for
let
the
conquest
be
never
so
sure
the
people
require
it
and
the
conqueror
is
obliged
to
give
some
better
reason
than
that
of
the
strength
of
his
sword
for
his
dominion
over
them
this
pretension
is
a
declaration
or
rather
a
most
scandalous
pernicious
and
treasonable
libel
if
i
may
say
so
who
have
so
great
an
interest
in
it
penned
with
all
the
malice
envy
can
invent
the
most
unbred
rude
piece
of
stuff
as
makes
it
apparent
the
author
had
neither
wit
nor
common
good
manners
besides
the
hellish
principles
he
has
made
evident
there
my
lord
would
have
no
hand
in
the
approbation
of
this
gross
piece
of
villainous
scandal
which
has
more
unfastened
him
from
their
interest
than
any
other
designs
and
from
which
he
daily
more
and
more
declines
or
seems
disgusted
with
though
he
does
not
wholly
intend
to
quit
the
interest
having
no
other
probable
means
to
make
good
that
fortune
which
has
been
so
evidently
and
wholly
destroyed
by
i
am
extremely
glad
said
sentiments
are
so
generous
and
am
at
nothing
so
much
amazed
as
to
hear
the
prince
could
suffer
so
gross
a
thing
to
pass
in
his
i
must
said
the
prince
right
in
this
point
to
assure
you
when
the
thing
was
first
in
the
rough
draught
shewed
him
he
told
that
those
accusations
of
a
crowned
head
were
too
villainous
for
the
thoughts
of
a
gentleman
and
giving
it
him
again
cried
no
let
it
never
be
said
that
the
royal
blood
that
runs
in
my
veins
could
dictate
to
me
no
more
noble
ways
for
its
defence
and
pretensions
than
the
mean
cowardice
of
lies
and
that
to
attain
to
empire
i
should
have
recourse
to
the
most
detestable
of
all
shifts
no
no
my
too
zealous
friend
continued
he
i
will
with
only
my
sword
in
my
hand
at
the
head
of
my
army
proclaim
my
right
and
demand
a
crown
which
if
i
win
is
mine
if
not
it
is
his
whose
sword
is
better
or
luckier
and
though
the
future
world
may
call
this
unjust
at
least
they
will
say
it
was
at
this
the
wizard
smiled
and
replied
alas
sir
had
we
hitherto
acted
by
rules
of
generosity
only
we
had
not
brought
so
great
advantages
to
our
interest
you
tell
me
sir
of
a
speech
you
will
make
with
your
sword
in
your
hand
that
will
do
very
well
at
the
head
of
an
army
and
a
handsome
declaration
would
be
proper
for
men
of
sense
but
this
is
not
to
the
wise
but
to
the
fools
on
whom
nothing
will
pass
but
what
is
penned
to
their
capacity
and
who
will
not
be
able
to
hear
the
speeches
you
shall
make
to
an
army
this
is
to
rouse
them
and
find
them
wherever
they
are
how
far
remote
soever
from
you
that
at
once
they
may
be
incited
to
assist
you
and
espouse
your
interest
this
is
the
sort
of
gospel
they
believe
all
other
is
too
fine
believe
me
sir
it
is
by
these
gross
devices
you
are
to
persuade
those
sons
of
earth
whose
spirits
never
mounted
above
the
dunghill
whence
they
grew
like
pumpkins
lies
are
the
spirit
that
inspires
them
they
are
the
very
brandy
that
makes
them
valiant
and
you
may
as
soon
beat
sense
into
their
brains
as
the
very
appearance
of
truth
it
is
the
very
language
of
the
scarlet
beast
to
them
they
understand
no
other
than
their
own
and
he
that
does
knows
to
what
ends
we
aim
no
matter
sir
what
tools
you
work
withal
so
the
finished
piece
be
fine
at
last
look
forward
to
the
goal
a
crown
attends
it
and
never
mind
the
dirty
road
that
leads
to
with
such
false
arguments
as
these
he
wrought
upon
the
easy
nature
of
the
prince
who
ordered
some
thousands
of
them
to
be
printed
for
their
being
dispersed
all
over
france
as
soon
as
they
should
be
landed
especially
among
the
too
apt
to
take
any
impressions
that
bore
the
stamp
and
pretence
of
religion
and
liberty
these
and
all
other
things
necessary
were
preparing
wholly
given
over
to
love
being
urged
by
to
know
the
occasion
of
his
last
night
s
absence
unravels
all
the
secret
and
told
my
lord
and
her
one
night
at
supper
the
whole
scene
of
the
so
that
more
than
ever
being
puffed
up
with
ambitious
thoughts
hastened
to
have
the
prince
pressed
to
marry
her
and
consulting
with
the
counsellor
of
her
closest
secrets
sets
him
anew
to
work
swearing
violently
that
if
he
did
not
bring
that
design
about
she
should
be
able
by
her
ascendancy
over
to
ruin
all
those
they
had
undertaken
and
yet
turn
the
prince
from
the
enterprise
and
that
it
was
more
to
satisfy
her
ambition
to
which
they
were
obliged
for
all
the
prince
had
promised
that
he
had
undertaken
to
head
an
army
and
put
himself
again
into
the
hands
of
the
and
forsake
all
the
soft
repose
of
love
and
life
than
for
any
inclination
or
ambition
of
his
own
and
that
she
who
had
power
to
animate
him
one
way
he
might
be
assured
had
the
same
power
another
this
she
ended
in
very
high
language
with
a
look
too
fierce
and
fiery
to
leave
him
any
doubt
of
and
he
promised
all
things
should
be
done
as
she
desired
and
that
he
would
overcome
the
prince
and
bring
him
absolutely
under
her
power
not
said
she
with
a
scornful
look
that
i
need
your
aid
in
this
affair
or
want
of
power
of
my
own
to
command
it
but
i
will
not
have
him
look
upon
it
as
my
act
alone
or
a
thing
of
my
seeking
but
by
your
advice
shall
be
made
to
understand
it
is
for
the
good
of
the
public
that
having
to
do
with
a
sort
of
people
of
the
reformed
religion
whose
pretences
were
more
nice
than
wise
more
seemingly
zealous
than
reasonable
or
just
they
might
look
upon
the
life
she
led
the
prince
as
scandalous
that
was
not
justified
by
form
though
never
so
a
thousand
things
she
urged
to
him
who
needed
no
instruction
how
to
make
that
appear
authentic
and
just
however
contrary
to
religion
and
sense
but
so
informed
he
parted
from
her
and
told
her
the
event
should
declare
his
zeal
for
her
service
and
so
it
did
for
he
no
sooner
spoke
of
it
to
the
prince
but
he
took
the
hint
as
a
divine
voice
his
very
soul
flushed
in
his
lovely
cheeks
and
all
the
fire
of
love
was
dancing
in
his
eyes
yet
as
if
he
had
feared
what
he
wished
could
not
handsomely
and
lawfully
be
brought
to
pass
he
asked
a
thousand
questions
concerning
it
all
which
the
subtle
wizard
so
well
resolved
at
least
in
his
judgement
who
easily
was
convinced
of
what
he
wished
that
he
no
longer
deferred
his
happiness
but
that
very
night
in
the
visit
he
made
fell
at
her
feet
and
implored
her
consent
of
what
he
told
her
had
fully
convinced
him
was
necessary
for
his
interest
and
glory
neither
of
which
he
could
enjoy
or
regard
if
she
was
not
the
partner
of
them
and
that
when
he
should
go
to
and
put
himself
in
the
field
to
demand
a
crown
he
should
do
it
with
absolute
vigour
and
resolution
if
she
were
to
be
seated
as
queen
on
the
same
throne
with
him
without
whom
a
cottage
would
be
more
pleasant
and
he
could
relish
no
joys
that
were
not
as
entirely
and
immediately
hers
as
his
own
he
pleaded
impatiently
for
what
she
longed
and
would
have
made
her
petition
for
and
all
the
while
she
makes
a
thousand
doubts
and
scruples
only
to
be
convinced
and
confirmed
by
him
and
after
seeming
fully
satisfied
he
led
her
into
a
chamber
where
waited
and
only
her
woman
and
his
faithful
confidant
and
married
her
since
which
she
has
wholly
managed
him
with
greater
power
than
before
takes
abundance
of
state
is
extremely
elevated
i
will
not
say
insolent
and
though
they
do
not
make
a
public
declaration
of
this
yet
she
owns
it
to
all
her
intimates
and
is
ever
reproaching
my
lord
with
his
lewd
course
of
life
wholly
forgetting
her
own
crying
out
upon
infamous
women
as
if
she
had
been
all
the
course
of
her
life
an
by
this
time
dinner
was
ended
and
urged
to
depart
with
her
letter
but
he
was
extremely
surprised
to
find
it
to
be
to
the
governor
s
nephew
who
was
his
lord
s
friend
and
who
would
doubtless
give
him
an
account
of
all
if
he
did
not
shew
him
the
billet
all
these
reasons
could
not
dissuade
this
fickle
wanderer
whose
heart
was
at
that
time
set
on
this
young
inconstant
at
least
her
inclinations
he
tells
her
that
her
life
would
be
really
in
danger
if
comes
to
the
knowledge
of
such
an
intrigue
which
could
not
possibly
be
carried
on
in
that
town
without
noise
she
tells
him
she
is
resolved
to
quit
that
false
injurer
of
her
fame
and
beauty
who
had
basely
abandoned
her
for
other
women
of
less
merit
even
since
she
had
pardoned
him
the
crimes
of
love
he
committed
at
that
while
he
was
in
the
country
with
her
during
the
time
of
her
he
had
given
himself
to
all
that
would
receive
him
there
that
since
he
came
away
he
had
left
no
beauty
unattempted
and
could
he
possibly
imagine
her
of
a
spirit
to
bow
beneath
such
injuries
no
she
would
on
to
all
the
revenges
her
youth
and
beauty
were
capable
of
taking
and
stick
at
nothing
that
led
to
that
interest
and
that
if
he
did
not
join
with
her
in
her
noble
design
she
would
abandon
him
and
put
herself
wholly
out
of
his
protection
this
she
spoke
with
a
fierceness
that
made
the
lover
tremble
with
fear
of
losing
her
he
therefore
told
her
she
had
reason
and
that
since
she
was
resolved
he
would
confess
to
her
that
was
the
most
perfidious
creature
in
the
world
and
that
the
haughty
who
hated
naughty
women
invited
and
treated
all
the
handsome
ladies
of
the
court
to
balls
and
to
the
and
made
very
great
entertainments
only
to
draw
to
her
interest
all
the
brave
and
the
young
men
and
that
she
daily
gained
abundance
by
these
arts
to
and
above
all
strove
by
these
amusements
to
engage
whom
she
perceived
to
grow
cold
in
the
great
concern
daily
treating
him
with
variety
of
beauty
so
that
there
was
no
gaiety
no
gallantry
or
play
but
at
whither
all
the
youth
of
both
qualities
repaired
and
it
was
there
the
governor
s
nephew
was
every
evening
to
be
found
possibly
madam
i
had
not
told
you
this
if
the
prince
s
bounty
had
not
taken
me
totally
off
from
so
that
i
have
no
other
dependence
on
him
but
that
of
my
respect
and
duty
out
of
perfect
after
this
to
gain
entirely
she
assured
him
if
his
fortune
were
suitable
to
her
quality
and
her
way
of
life
she
believed
she
should
devote
herself
to
him
and
though
what
she
said
were
the
least
of
her
thoughts
it
failed
not
to
flatter
him
agreeably
and
he
sighed
with
grief
that
he
could
not
engage
her
all
he
could
get
was
little
enough
to
support
him
fine
which
he
was
always
as
any
person
of
quality
at
court
and
appeared
as
graceful
and
might
have
had
some
happy
minutes
with
very
fine
ladies
who
thought
well
of
him
to
salve
this
defect
of
want
of
fortune
he
told
her
he
had
received
a
command
from
to
come
to
him
about
settling
of
a
very
considerable
pension
upon
her
and
that
he
had
at
his
investing
put
money
into
his
aunt
s
hands
who
was
a
woman
of
considerable
quality
to
be
disposed
of
to
that
charitable
use
and
that
if
she
pleased
to
maintain
her
rest
of
fame
and
live
without
receiving
from
men
she
might
now
command
that
which
would
be
a
much
better
and
nobler
support
than
that
from
a
lover
which
would
be
transitory
and
last
but
as
long
as
her
beauty
or
a
less
time
his
love
to
this
she
knew
not
what
to
answer
but
ready
money
being
the
joy
of
her
heart
and
the
support
of
her
vanity
she
seems
to
yield
to
this
having
said
so
much
before
and
she
considered
she
wanted
a
thousand
things
to
adorn
her
beauty
being
very
expensive
she
was
impatient
till
this
was
performed
and
deferred
the
sending
to
though
her
thoughts
were
perpetually
on
him
she
by
the
advice
of
writes
a
letter
to
which
was
not
like
those
she
had
before
written
but
as
an
humble
penitent
would
write
to
a
ghostly
father
treating
him
with
all
the
respect
that
was
possible
and
if
ever
she
mentioned
love
it
was
as
if
her
heart
had
violently
and
against
her
will
burst
out
into
softness
as
still
she
retained
there
and
then
she
would
take
up
again
and
ask
pardon
for
that
transgression
she
told
him
it
was
a
passion
which
though
she
could
never
extinguish
for
him
yet
that
it
should
never
warm
her
for
another
but
she
would
leave
to
the
world
and
retire
where
she
was
not
known
and
try
to
make
up
her
broken
fortunes
with
abundance
of
things
to
this
purpose
which
he
carried
to
he
said
he
could
have
wished
she
would
have
retired
to
a
monastery
as
all
the
first
part
of
her
letter
had
given
him
hope
and
resolved
and
retired
as
he
was
he
could
not
read
this
without
extreme
confusion
and
change
of
countenance
he
asked
a
thousand
times
whether
he
believed
he
might
trust
her
or
if
she
would
abandon
those
ways
of
shame
that
at
last
lost
all
he
answered
he
verily
believed
she
would
however
said
it
is
not
my
business
to
capitulate
but
to
believe
and
act
all
things
for
the
interest
and
satisfaction
of
her
whom
i
yet
adore
and
without
further
delay
writ
to
his
aunt
to
present
with
those
sums
he
had
left
for
her
and
which
had
been
sufficient
to
have
made
her
happy
all
the
rest
of
her
life
if
her
sins
of
love
had
not
obstructed
it
however
she
no
sooner
found
herself
mistress
of
so
considerable
a
sum
but
in
lieu
of
retiring
and
ordering
her
affairs
so
as
to
render
it
for
ever
serviceable
to
her
the
first
thing
she
does
is
to
furnish
herself
with
new
coach
and
equipage
and
to
lavish
out
in
clothes
and
jewels
a
great
part
of
it
immediately
and
was
impatient
to
be
seen
on
the
and
in
all
public
places
nor
could
persuade
the
contrary
but
against
all
good
manners
and
reason
she
flew
into
most
violent
passions
with
him
till
he
had
resolved
to
give
her
her
way
it
happened
that
the
first
day
she
shewed
on
the
neither
nor
chanced
to
be
there
so
that
at
supper
it
was
all
the
news
how
glorious
a
young
creature
was
seen
only
with
one
lady
which
was
very
well
dressed
in
the
coach
with
her
every
body
that
made
their
court
that
night
to
spoke
of
this
new
vision
as
the
most
extraordinary
charmer
that
had
ever
been
seen
all
were
that
day
undone
with
love
and
none
could
learn
who
this
fair
destroyer
was
for
all
the
time
of
being
at
before
her
being
big
with
child
had
kept
her
from
appearing
in
all
public
places
so
that
she
was
wholly
a
new
face
to
all
that
saw
her
and
it
is
easy
to
be
imagined
what
charms
that
delicate
person
appeared
with
to
all
when
dressed
to
such
advantage
who
naturally
was
the
most
beautiful
creature
in
the
world
with
all
the
bloom
of
youth
that
could
add
to
beauty
among
the
rest
that
day
that
lost
their
hearts
was
the
governor
s
nephew
who
came
into
the
presence
that
night
wholly
transported
and
told
he
died
for
the
lovely
charmer
he
had
that
day
seen
so
that
she
who
was
the
most
curious
to
gain
all
the
beauties
to
her
side
that
the
men
might
be
so
too
endeavoured
all
she
could
to
find
out
where
this
beauty
dwelt
now
grown
the
most
amorous
and
gallant
in
the
world
grew
passionately
in
love
with
the
very
description
of
her
not
imagining
it
had
been
because
of
her
equipage
he
knew
she
loved
him
at
least
he
thought
she
loved
him
too
well
to
conceal
herself
from
him
or
be
in
and
not
let
him
know
it
so
that
wholly
ravished
with
the
description
of
the
imagined
new
fair
one
he
burnt
with
desire
of
seeing
her
and
all
this
night
was
passed
in
discourse
of
this
stranger
alone
the
next
day
her
livery
being
described
to
she
sent
two
pages
all
about
the
town
to
see
if
they
could
discover
a
livery
so
remarkable
and
that
if
they
did
they
should
inquire
of
them
who
they
belonged
to
and
where
that
person
s
lodging
was
this
was
not
a
very
difficult
matter
to
perform
is
not
a
large
place
and
it
was
soon
surveyed
from
one
end
to
the
other
at
last
they
met
with
two
of
her
footmen
whom
they
saluted
and
taking
notice
of
their
livery
asked
them
who
they
belonged
to
these
lads
were
strangers
to
the
lady
they
served
and
newly
taken
and
at
first
coming
resolved
to
change
her
name
and
was
called
madame
de
a
name
very
considerable
in
which
they
told
the
pages
and
that
she
lived
in
such
a
place
this
news
no
sooner
heard
but
she
sends
a
gentleman
in
the
name
of
the
prince
and
herself
to
compliment
her
and
tell
her
she
had
the
honour
to
know
some
great
persons
of
that
name
in
and
did
not
doubt
but
she
was
related
to
them
she
therefore
sent
to
offer
her
her
friendship
which
possibly
in
a
strange
place
might
not
be
unserviceable
to
her
and
that
she
should
be
extreme
glad
to
see
her
at
court
that
is
at
palace
the
gentleman
who
delivered
this
message
being
surprised
at
the
dazzling
beauty
of
the
fair
stranger
was
almost
unassured
in
his
address
and
the
manner
of
it
surprised
no
less
to
be
invited
as
a
strange
lady
by
one
that
hated
her
she
could
not
tell
whether
it
were
real
or
a
plot
upon
her
however
she
made
answer
and
bid
him
tell
madam
the
princess
which
title
she
gave
her
that
she
received
her
compliment
as
the
greatest
honour
that
could
arrive
to
her
and
that
she
would
wait
upon
her
highness
and
let
her
know
from
her
own
mouth
the
sense
she
had
of
the
obligation
the
gentleman
returned
and
delivered
his
message
to
but
so
altered
in
his
look
so
sad
and
unusual
that
she
took
notice
of
it
and
asked
him
how
he
liked
the
new
beauty
he
blushed
and
bowed
and
told
her
she
was
a
wonder
this
made
colour
rise
it
being
spoke
before
for
though
she
was
assured
of
the
hero
s
heart
she
hated
he
should
believe
there
was
a
greater
beauty
in
the
world
and
one
universally
adored
she
knew
not
how
so
great
a
miracle
might
work
upon
him
and
began
to
repent
she
had
invited
her
to
court
in
the
mean
time
after
debating
what
to
do
in
this
affair
whether
to
visit
and
discover
herself
or
to
remove
from
resolved
rather
upon
the
last
but
she
had
fixed
her
design
as
to
and
would
not
depart
the
town
to
her
former
beginning
flame
for
him
was
added
more
fuel
she
had
seen
him
the
day
before
on
the
she
had
seen
him
gaze
at
her
with
all
the
impatience
of
love
with
madness
of
passion
in
his
eyes
ready
to
fling
himself
out
of
the
coach
every
time
she
passed
by
and
if
he
appeared
beautiful
before
when
in
his
riding
dress
and
harassed
for
four
nights
together
with
love
and
want
of
sleep
what
did
he
now
appear
to
her
amorous
eyes
and
heart
she
had
wholly
forgot
and
all
and
made
a
sacrifice
of
both
to
this
new
young
lover
she
saw
him
with
all
the
advantages
of
dress
magnificent
as
youth
and
fortune
could
invent
and
above
all
his
beauty
and
his
quality
warmed
her
heart
anew
and
what
advanced
her
flame
yet
farther
was
a
vanity
she
had
of
fixing
the
dear
wanderer
and
making
him
find
there
was
a
beauty
yet
in
the
world
that
could
put
an
end
to
his
inconstancy
and
make
him
languish
at
her
feet
as
long
as
she
pleased
resolved
on
this
new
design
she
defers
it
no
longer
but
as
soon
as
the
persons
of
quality
who
used
to
walk
every
evening
in
the
park
were
got
together
she
accompanied
with
and
three
or
four
strange
pages
and
footmen
went
into
the
park
and
dressed
in
perfect
glory
she
had
not
walked
long
there
before
she
saw
richer
than
ever
in
his
habit
and
more
beautiful
to
her
eyes
than
any
thing
she
had
ever
seen
he
was
gotten
among
the
young
and
fair
caressing
laughing
playing
and
acting
all
the
little
wantonnesses
of
youth
blood
grew
disordered
at
this
and
she
found
she
loved
by
her
jealousy
and
longs
more
than
ever
to
have
the
glory
of
vanquishing
that
heart
that
so
boasted
of
never
having
yet
been
conquered
she
therefore
uses
all
her
art
to
get
him
to
look
at
her
she
passed
by
him
often
and
as
often
as
she
did
so
he
viewed
her
with
pleasure
her
shape
her
air
her
mien
had
something
so
charming
as
without
the
assistance
of
her
face
she
gained
that
evening
a
thousand
conquests
but
those
were
not
the
trophies
she
aimed
at
it
was
was
the
victim
that
she
destined
for
the
sacrifice
of
love
she
found
him
so
engaged
with
women
of
great
quality
she
almost
despaired
to
get
to
speak
to
him
her
equipage
which
stood
at
the
entrance
of
the
park
not
being
by
her
he
did
not
imagine
this
fine
lady
to
be
her
he
saw
on
the
last
night
yet
he
looked
at
her
so
much
as
gave
occasion
to
those
he
was
with
to
rally
him
extremely
and
tell
him
he
was
in
love
with
what
he
had
not
seen
and
who
might
notwithstanding
all
that
delicate
appearance
be
ugly
when
her
mask
was
off
however
still
passed
on
with
abundance
of
sighing
lovers
after
her
some
daring
to
speak
others
only
languishing
to
all
she
would
vouchsafe
no
word
but
made
signs
as
if
she
were
a
stranger
and
understood
them
not
at
last
wholly
impatient
breaks
from
these
ralliers
and
gets
into
the
crowd
that
pursued
this
lovely
unknown
her
heart
leaped
when
he
approached
her
and
the
first
thing
she
did
was
to
pull
off
her
glove
and
not
only
shew
the
fairest
hand
that
ever
nature
made
but
that
ring
on
her
finger
gave
her
when
they
parted
at
the
village
the
hand
alone
was
enough
to
invite
all
eyes
with
pleasure
to
look
that
way
but
had
a
double
motive
he
saw
the
hand
with
love
and
the
ring
with
jealousy
and
surprise
and
as
it
is
natural
in
such
cases
the
very
first
thought
that
possessed
him
was
that
the
young
for
so
had
called
herself
at
the
village
was
a
lover
of
this
lady
and
had
presented
her
this
ring
and
after
his
sighings
and
little
pantings
that
seized
him
at
this
thought
would
give
him
leave
he
bowing
and
blushing
cried
madam
the
whole
piece
must
be
excellent
when
the
pattern
is
so
very
and
humbly
begging
the
favour
of
a
nearer
view
he
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
with
a
passionate
eagerness
which
possibly
did
not
so
well
please
because
she
did
not
think
he
took
her
for
the
same
person
to
whom
he
shewed
such
signs
of
love
last
night
in
taking
her
hand
he
surveyed
the
ring
and
cried
madam
would
to
heaven
i
could
lay
so
good
a
claim
to
this
fair
hand
as
i
think
i
once
could
to
this
ring
which
this
hand
adorns
and
how
sir
replied
i
hope
you
will
not
charge
me
with
felony
i
am
afraid
i
shall
replied
he
sighing
you
have
attacked
me
on
the
king
s
and
have
robbed
me
of
a
heart
i
could
never
have
robbed
a
person
said
who
could
more
easily
have
parted
with
that
trifle
the
next
fair
object
will
redeem
it
and
it
will
be
very
little
the
worse
for
my
madam
replied
he
sighing
that
will
be
according
as
you
will
treat
it
for
i
find
already
you
have
done
it
more
damage
than
it
ever
sustained
in
all
the
rencounters
it
has
had
with
love
and
you
complain
too
soon
replied
smiling
and
you
ought
to
make
a
trial
of
my
good
nature
before
you
reproach
me
with
harming
i
know
not
replied
sighing
what
i
may
venture
to
hope
from
that
but
i
am
afraid
from
your
inclinations
i
ought
to
hope
for
nothing
since
a
thousand
reasonable
jealousies
already
possess
me
from
the
sight
of
that
ring
and
i
more
than
doubt
i
have
a
powerful
rival
a
youth
of
the
most
divine
form
i
ever
met
with
of
his
sex
if
from
him
you
received
it
i
guess
my
i
perceive
stranger
said
you
begin
to
be
inconstant
already
and
find
excuses
to
complain
on
your
fate
before
you
have
tried
your
fortune
i
persuade
myself
that
fine
person
you
speak
of
and
to
whom
you
gave
this
ring
has
so
great
a
value
for
you
that
to
leave
you
no
excuse
i
assure
you
he
will
not
be
displeased
to
find
you
a
rival
provided
you
prove
a
very
constant
i
confess
said
constancy
is
an
imposition
i
never
yet
had
the
confidence
and
ill
nature
to
impose
on
the
fair
and
indeed
i
never
found
that
woman
yet
of
youth
and
beauty
that
ever
set
so
small
a
value
on
her
own
charms
to
be
much
in
love
with
that
dull
virtue
and
require
it
of
my
heart
but
upon
occasion
madam
if
such
an
unreasonable
fair
one
be
found
i
am
extremely
sorry
interrupted
to
find
you
have
no
better
way
of
recommending
yourself
this
will
be
no
great
encouragement
to
a
person
of
my
humour
to
receive
your
madam
i
do
not
tell
you
that
i
am
not
in
my
nature
wondrous
constant
replied
he
i
tell
you
only
what
has
hitherto
happened
to
me
not
what
will
that
i
have
yet
never
been
so
is
no
fault
of
mine
but
power
or
truth
in
those
beauties
to
whom
i
have
given
my
heart
rather
believe
they
wanted
charms
to
hold
me
than
that
i
where
wit
and
beauty
engaged
me
should
prove
so
false
to
my
own
pleasure
i
am
very
much
afraid
madam
if
i
find
my
eyes
as
agreeably
entertained
when
i
shall
have
the
honour
to
see
your
face
as
my
ears
are
with
your
excellent
wit
i
shall
be
reduced
to
that
very
whining
sighing
coxcomb
you
like
so
well
in
a
lover
and
be
ever
dying
at
your
feet
i
have
but
one
hope
left
to
preserve
myself
from
this
wretched
thing
you
women
love
that
is
that
i
shall
not
find
you
so
all
over
charming
as
what
i
have
hitherto
found
presents
itself
to
be
you
have
already
created
love
enough
in
me
for
any
reasonable
woman
but
i
find
you
are
not
to
be
approached
with
the
common
devotions
we
pay
your
sex
but
like
your
beauty
the
passion
too
must
be
great
and
you
are
not
content
unless
you
see
your
lovers
die
this
is
that
fatal
proof
alone
that
can
satisfy
you
of
their
passion
and
though
you
laugh
to
see
a
sir
a
fop
in
fashion
acted
on
the
stage
in
your
hearts
that
foolish
thing
that
fine
neat
pasquil
is
your
darling
your
fine
gentleman
your
thus
sometimes
in
jest
and
sometimes
in
earnest
they
recommended
themselves
to
each
other
and
to
so
great
a
degree
that
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
be
more
charmed
on
either
side
which
lasted
it
was
time
to
depart
but
he
besought
her
not
to
do
so
till
she
had
informed
him
where
he
might
wait
on
her
and
most
passionately
solicit
what
she
as
passionately
desired
to
tell
you
truth
said
she
i
can
not
permit
you
that
freedom
without
you
ask
it
of
he
replied
next
to
waiting
on
her
he
should
be
the
most
overjoyed
in
the
world
to
pay
his
respects
to
that
young
however
to
name
him
gave
him
a
thousand
fears
which
when
he
would
have
urged
she
bid
him
trust
to
the
generosity
of
that
man
who
was
of
quality
and
loved
him
she
then
told
him
his
lodgings
which
were
her
own
infinitely
overjoyed
resolved
to
lose
no
time
but
promised
that
evening
to
visit
him
and
at
their
parting
he
treated
her
with
so
much
passionate
respect
that
she
was
vexed
to
see
it
paid
to
one
he
yet
knew
not
however
she
verily
believed
her
conquest
was
certain
he
having
seen
her
three
times
and
all
those
times
for
a
several
person
and
yet
was
still
in
love
with
her
and
she
doubted
not
when
all
three
were
joined
in
one
he
would
be
much
more
in
love
than
yet
he
had
been
with
this
assurance
they
parted
was
no
sooner
got
home
but
she
resolved
to
receive
who
she
was
assured
would
come
she
hasted
to
dress
herself
in
a
very
rich
suit
of
man
s
clothes
to
receive
him
as
the
young
gentleman
she
believed
would
not
come
till
late
as
was
his
use
now
being
at
play
at
she
looked
extreme
pretty
when
she
was
dressed
and
had
all
the
charms
that
heaven
could
adorn
a
face
and
shape
withal
her
apartment
was
very
magnificent
and
all
looked
very
great
she
was
no
sooner
dressed
but
the
young
lover
came
received
him
on
the
with
open
arms
and
all
the
signs
of
joy
that
could
be
expressed
and
led
him
to
a
rich
where
she
began
to
entertain
him
with
that
happy
night
s
adventure
when
they
both
lay
together
at
the
village
while
makes
imperfect
replies
wholly
charmed
with
the
look
of
the
young
cavalier
which
so
resembled
what
he
had
seen
the
day
before
in
another
garb
on
the
he
is
wholly
ravished
with
his
voice
it
being
absolutely
the
same
that
had
charmed
him
that
day
in
the
park
the
more
he
gazed
and
listened
the
more
he
was
confirmed
in
his
opinion
that
he
was
the
same
and
he
had
the
music
of
that
dear
accent
still
in
his
ears
and
could
not
be
deceived
a
thousand
times
he
is
about
to
kneel
before
her
and
ask
her
pardon
but
still
is
checked
by
doubt
he
sees
he
hears
this
is
the
same
lovely
youth
who
lay
in
bed
with
him
at
the
village
and
then
no
longer
thinks
her
woman
he
hears
and
sees
it
is
the
same
face
and
voice
and
hands
he
saw
on
the
and
in
the
park
and
then
believes
her
woman
while
he
is
in
these
perplexities
who
with
vanity
and
pride
perceived
his
disorder
taking
him
in
her
arms
cried
my
that
you
shall
no
longer
doubt
but
i
am
perfectly
your
friend
i
will
shew
you
a
sister
of
mine
whom
you
will
say
is
a
beauty
or
i
am
too
partial
and
i
will
have
your
judgement
of
with
that
she
called
to
to
beg
her
lady
would
permit
her
to
bring
a
young
stranger
to
kiss
her
hand
the
maid
instructed
retires
and
stood
gazing
on
as
one
confounded
and
amazed
not
knowing
yet
how
to
determine
he
now
begins
to
think
himself
mistaken
in
the
fair
youth
and
is
ready
to
ask
his
pardon
for
a
fault
but
imagined
suffering
by
his
silence
the
little
prattler
to
discourse
and
laugh
at
him
at
his
pleasure
come
said
smiling
i
find
the
naming
a
beauty
to
you
has
made
you
melancholy
possibly
when
you
see
her
she
will
not
appear
so
to
you
we
do
not
always
agree
in
one
your
judgement
replied
is
too
good
to
leave
me
any
hope
of
liberty
at
the
sight
of
a
fine
woman
if
she
be
like
yourself
i
read
my
destiny
in
your
charming
answered
only
with
a
smile
and
calling
again
for
she
asked
if
her
sister
were
in
a
condition
of
being
seen
she
told
her
she
was
not
but
all
undressed
and
in
her
nay
then
said
i
must
use
my
authority
with
her
and
leaving
trembling
with
expectation
she
ran
to
her
where
all
things
were
ready
and
slipping
off
her
coat
put
on
a
rich
and
instead
of
her
peruke
fine
and
came
forth
to
the
charmed
who
was
not
able
to
approach
her
she
looked
with
such
a
majesty
and
so
much
dazzling
beauty
he
knew
her
to
be
the
same
he
had
seen
on
the
she
seeing
he
only
gazed
without
life
or
motion
approaching
him
gave
him
her
hand
and
cried
sir
possibly
this
is
a
more
old
acquaintance
of
yours
than
my
at
which
he
blushed
and
bowed
but
could
not
speak
at
last
laughing
cried
here
bring
me
again
my
peruke
for
i
find
i
shall
never
be
acquainted
with
in
at
this
he
blushed
a
thousand
times
more
than
before
and
no
longer
doubted
but
this
charmer
and
the
lovely
youth
were
one
he
fell
at
her
feet
and
told
her
he
was
undone
for
she
had
made
him
give
her
so
indisputable
proofs
of
his
dullness
he
could
never
hope
she
should
allow
him
capable
of
eternally
adoring
her
rise
cried
smiling
and
believe
you
have
not
committed
so
great
an
error
as
you
imagine
the
mistake
has
been
often
made
and
persons
of
a
great
deal
of
wit
have
been
you
may
say
what
you
please
replied
to
put
me
in
countenance
but
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
the
stupidity
of
that
happy
night
that
laid
me
by
the
most
glorious
beauty
of
the
world
and
yet
afforded
me
no
kind
instinct
to
inform
my
soul
how
much
i
was
blest
oh
pity
a
wretchedness
divine
maid
that
has
no
other
excuse
but
that
of
infatuation
a
thousand
times
my
greedy
ravished
eyes
wandered
over
the
dazzling
brightness
of
yours
a
thousand
times
i
wished
that
heaven
had
made
you
woman
and
when
i
looked
i
burnt
but
when
i
kissed
those
soft
those
lovely
lips
i
durst
not
trust
my
heart
for
every
touch
begot
wild
thoughts
about
it
which
yet
the
course
of
all
my
fiery
youth
through
all
the
wild
debauches
i
had
wandered
had
never
yet
betrayed
me
to
and
going
to
bed
with
all
this
love
and
fear
about
me
i
made
a
solemn
oath
not
to
approach
you
lest
so
much
beauty
had
overcome
my
virtue
but
by
this
new
discovery
you
have
given
me
a
flame
i
have
no
power
nor
virtue
to
oppose
it
is
just
it
is
natural
to
adore
you
and
not
to
do
it
were
a
greater
than
my
sin
of
dullness
and
since
you
have
made
me
lose
a
charming
friend
it
is
but
just
i
find
a
mistress
give
me
but
your
permission
to
love
and
i
will
give
you
all
my
life
in
service
and
wait
the
rest
i
will
watch
and
pray
for
coming
happiness
which
i
will
buy
at
any
price
of
life
or
well
sir
replied
our
easy
fair
one
if
you
believe
me
worth
a
conquest
over
you
convince
me
you
can
love
for
i
am
no
common
beauty
to
be
won
with
petty
sudden
services
and
could
you
lay
an
empire
at
my
feet
i
should
despise
it
where
the
heart
were
you
may
believe
the
amorous
youth
left
no
argument
to
convince
her
in
that
point
unsaid
and
it
is
most
certain
they
came
to
so
good
an
understanding
that
he
was
not
seen
in
for
eight
days
and
nights
after
nor
this
rare
beauty
for
so
long
a
time
seen
on
the
or
any
public
place
came
every
day
to
visit
her
and
receive
her
commands
as
he
used
to
do
but
was
answered
still
that
was
ill
and
kept
her
chamber
not
suffering
even
her
domestics
to
approach
her
this
did
not
so
well
satisfy
the
jealous
lover
but
he
soon
imagined
the
cause
and
was
very
much
displeased
at
the
ill
treatment
if
such
a
design
had
been
carried
on
he
desired
to
have
the
management
of
it
and
was
angry
that
had
not
only
deceived
him
in
the
promise
he
had
made
for
her
to
but
had
done
her
own
business
without
him
he
spoke
some
hard
words
so
that
to
undeceive
him
she
was
forced
to
oblige
to
appear
at
court
again
which
she
had
much
ado
to
incline
him
to
so
absolutely
she
had
charmed
him
however
he
went
and
she
suffered
to
visit
her
persuading
that
easy
lover
as
all
lovers
are
easy
that
it
was
only
indisposition
that
hindered
her
of
the
happiness
of
seeing
him
and
after
having
perfectly
reconciled
herself
to
him
she
asked
him
the
news
at
to
whom
i
had
forgot
to
tell
you
she
sent
every
day
a
page
with
a
compliment
and
to
let
her
know
she
was
ill
or
she
should
have
waited
on
her
she
every
day
received
the
compliment
from
her
again
as
an
unknown
lady
told
her
that
all
things
were
now
prepared
and
in
a
very
short
time
they
should
go
for
but
that
whatever
the
matter
was
almost
publicly
disowned
the
prince
s
interest
and
to
some
very
considerable
of
the
party
has
given
out
he
does
not
like
the
proceedings
and
that
he
verily
believed
they
would
find
themselves
all
mistaken
and
that
instead
of
a
throne
the
prince
would
meet
a
scaffold
so
bold
and
open
he
has
been
something
of
it
has
arrived
to
the
prince
s
ear
who
was
so
far
from
believing
it
that
he
could
hardly
be
persuaded
to
speak
of
it
to
him
and
when
he
did
it
was
with
an
assurance
that
he
did
not
credit
such
reports
so
that
he
gives
him
not
the
pain
to
deny
them
for
my
part
i
am
infinitely
afraid
he
will
disoblige
the
prince
one
day
for
last
night
when
the
prince
desired
him
to
get
his
equipage
ready
and
to
make
such
provision
for
you
as
was
necessary
he
coldly
told
him
he
had
a
mind
to
go
to
which
at
that
time
was
besieged
by
the
magnificent
and
that
he
had
no
inclination
of
returning
to
this
surprised
and
angered
the
prince
but
they
parted
good
friends
at
last
and
he
has
promised
him
all
things
so
that
i
am
very
well
assured
he
will
send
me
where
he
supposes
you
still
are
and
how
shall
we
manage
that
affair
who
had
more
cunning
and
subtleness
than
all
the
rest
of
her
sex
thought
it
best
to
see
and
part
with
him
on
as
good
terms
as
she
could
and
that
it
was
better
he
should
think
he
yet
had
the
absolute
possession
of
her
than
that
he
should
return
to
with
an
ill
opinion
of
her
virtue
as
yet
he
had
known
no
guilt
of
that
kind
nor
did
he
ever
more
than
fear
it
with
so
that
it
would
be
easy
for
her
to
cajole
him
yet
a
little
longer
and
when
he
was
gone
she
should
have
the
world
to
range
in
and
possess
this
new
lover
to
whom
she
had
promised
all
things
and
received
from
him
all
assurances
imaginable
of
inviolable
love
in
order
to
this
then
she
consulted
with
and
they
resolved
she
should
for
a
few
days
leave
with
her
equipage
at
that
house
where
she
was
and
retire
herself
to
the
village
where
had
left
her
and
where
he
still
imagined
she
was
she
desired
to
give
her
a
day
s
time
for
this
preparation
and
it
should
be
so
he
left
her
and
going
to
meets
who
immediately
gave
him
orders
to
go
to
the
next
morning
and
let
her
know
how
all
things
went
and
tell
her
he
would
be
with
her
in
two
days
in
the
mean
time
sent
for
who
was
but
that
evening
gone
from
her
he
flies
on
the
wings
of
love
and
she
tells
him
she
is
obliged
to
go
to
a
place
six
or
seven
days
journey
off
whither
he
could
not
conduct
her
for
reasons
she
would
tell
him
at
her
return
whatever
he
could
plead
with
all
the
force
of
love
to
the
contrary
she
gets
his
consent
with
a
promise
wholly
to
devote
herself
to
him
at
her
return
and
pleased
she
sent
him
from
her
when
returning
told
her
the
commands
he
had
and
it
was
concluded
they
should
both
depart
next
morning
accompanied
only
by
her
page
i
am
well
assured
she
was
very
kind
to
all
that
journey
and
which
was
but
too
visible
to
the
amorous
youth
who
attended
them
so
absolutely
had
she
depraved
her
reason
from
one
degree
of
sin
and
shame
to
another
and
he
was
happy
above
any
imagination
while
even
her
heart
was
given
to
another
and
when
she
could
propose
no
other
interest
in
this
looseness
but
security
that
should
not
know
how
ill
she
had
treated
him
in
four
days
came
and
finding
more
fair
than
ever
was
anew
pleased
for
she
pretended
to
receive
him
with
all
the
joy
imaginable
and
the
deceived
lover
believed
and
expressed
abundance
of
grief
at
the
being
obliged
to
part
from
her
a
great
many
vows
and
tears
were
lost
on
both
sides
and
both
believed
true
but
the
grief
of
was
not
to
be
conceived
he
could
not
persuade
himself
he
could
live
when
absent
from
her
some
bills
left
her
and
was
so
plain
with
her
and
he
told
her
that
he
went
indeed
with
but
it
was
in
order
to
serve
the
king
that
he
was
weary
of
their
actions
and
foresaw
nothing
but
ruin
would
attend
them
that
he
never
repented
him
of
any
thing
so
much
as
his
being
drawn
in
to
that
faction
in
which
he
found
himself
so
greatly
involved
he
could
not
retire
with
any
credit
but
since
was
the
first
principle
of
nature
he
had
resolved
to
make
that
his
aim
and
rather
prove
false
to
a
party
who
had
no
justice
and
honour
on
their
side
than
to
a
king
whom
all
the
laws
of
heaven
and
earth
obliged
him
to
serve
however
he
was
so
far
in
the
power
of
these
people
that
he
could
not
disengage
himself
without
utter
ruin
to
himself
but
that
as
soon
as
he
was
got
into
he
would
abandon
their
interest
let
the
censuring
world
say
what
it
would
who
never
had
right
notions
of
things
or
ever
made
true
judgements
of
men
s
actions
he
lived
five
or
six
days
with
there
in
which
time
she
failed
not
to
assure
him
of
her
constant
fidelity
a
thousand
ways
especially
by
vows
that
left
no
doubt
upon
his
heart
and
it
was
now
that
they
both
indeed
found
there
was
a
very
great
friendship
still
remaining
at
the
bottom
of
their
hearts
for
each
other
nor
did
they
part
without
manifold
proofs
of
it
took
a
sad
and
melancholy
leave
of
her
and
had
not
the
freedom
to
tell
her
aloud
but
obliged
to
depart
with
his
lord
they
left
and
posted
to
where
they
found
the
prince
ready
to
depart
having
left
to
her
women
more
than
half
dead
i
have
heard
there
never
was
so
sad
a
parting
between
two
lovers
a
hundred
times
they
swooned
with
the
apprehension
of
the
separation
in
each
other
s
arms
and
at
last
the
prince
was
forced
from
her
while
he
left
her
dead
and
was
little
better
himself
he
would
have
returned
but
the
officers
and
people
about
him
who
had
espoused
his
quarrel
would
by
no
means
suffer
him
and
he
has
a
thousand
times
told
a
person
very
near
him
that
he
had
rather
have
forfeited
all
his
glory
than
have
left
that
charmer
of
his
soul
after
he
had
taken
all
care
imaginable
for
for
that
name
so
dear
to
him
was
scarce
ever
out
of
his
mouth
he
suffered
himself
with
a
heavy
heart
and
pace
to
be
conducted
to
the
vessel
and
i
have
heard
he
was
hardly
seen
to
smile
all
the
little
voyage
or
his
whole
life
after
or
do
any
thing
but
sigh
and
sometimes
weep
which
was
a
very
great
discouragement
to
all
that
followed
him
they
were
a
great
while
at
sea
tossed
to
and
fro
by
stress
of
weather
and
often
driven
back
to
the
shore
where
they
first
took
shipping
and
not
being
able
to
land
where
they
first
designed
they
got
ashore
in
a
little
harbour
where
no
ship
of
any
bigness
could
anchor
so
that
with
much
ado
getting
all
their
arms
and
men
on
shore
they
sunk
the
ship
both
to
secure
any
from
flying
and
that
it
might
not
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
was
no
sooner
on
the
shore
but
numbers
came
to
him
of
the
party
for
whom
he
had
arms
and
who
wanted
them
he
furnished
as
far
as
he
could
and
immediately
proclaimed
himself
king
of
and
while
the
dirty
crowd
rang
him
peals
of
joy
but
though
the
under
world
came
in
great
crowds
to
his
aid
he
wanted
still
the
main
supporters
of
his
cause
the
men
of
substantial
quality
if
the
ladies
could
have
composed
an
army
he
would
not
have
wanted
one
for
his
beauty
had
got
them
all
on
his
side
and
he
charmed
the
fair
wheresoever
he
rode
he
marched
from
town
to
town
without
any
opposition
proclaiming
himself
king
in
all
the
places
he
came
to
still
gathering
as
he
marched
till
he
had
composed
a
very
formidable
army
he
made
officers
of
the
kingdom
was
to
have
been
a
cardinal
and
several
lords
and
dukes
were
nominated
and
he
found
no
opposition
in
all
his
prosperous
in
the
mean
time
the
royal
army
was
not
idle
which
was
composed
of
men
very
well
disciplined
and
conducted
by
several
princes
and
men
of
great
quality
and
conduct
but
as
it
is
not
the
business
of
this
little
history
to
treat
of
war
but
altogether
love
leaving
those
rougher
relations
to
the
chronicles
and
historiographers
of
those
times
i
will
only
hint
on
such
things
in
this
enterprise
as
are
most
proper
for
my
purpose
and
tell
you
that
omitted
nothing
for
the
carrying
on
his
great
design
he
dispersed
his
scandals
all
over
though
they
met
with
an
obstruction
at
and
were
immediately
suppressed
it
being
proclaimed
death
for
any
person
to
keep
one
in
their
houses
and
if
any
should
by
chance
come
to
their
hands
they
were
on
this
penalty
to
carry
them
to
the
secretary
of
state
and
after
the
punishment
had
passed
on
two
or
three
offenders
it
deterred
the
rest
from
meddling
with
those
edge
tools
i
must
tell
you
also
that
the
title
of
king
which
had
taken
so
early
upon
him
was
much
against
his
inclinations
and
he
desired
to
see
himself
at
the
head
of
a
more
satisfiable
army
before
he
would
take
on
him
a
title
he
found
in
the
condition
he
was
in
he
should
not
defend
but
those
about
him
insinuated
to
him
that
it
was
the
title
that
would
not
only
make
him
more
venerable
but
would
make
his
cause
appear
more
just
and
lawful
and
beget
him
a
perfect
adoration
with
those
people
who
lived
remote
from
courts
and
had
never
seen
that
glorious
thing
called
a
king
so
that
believing
it
would
give
nerves
to
the
cause
he
unhappily
took
upon
him
that
which
ruined
him
for
he
had
often
sworn
to
the
greatest
part
of
those
of
any
quality
of
his
interest
that
his
design
was
liberty
only
and
that
his
end
was
the
public
good
so
infinitely
above
his
own
private
interest
that
he
desired
only
the
honour
of
being
the
champion
for
the
oppressed
and
people
of
that
if
they
would
allow
him
to
lead
their
armies
to
fight
and
spend
his
dearest
blood
for
them
it
was
all
the
glory
he
aimed
at
it
was
this
pretended
humility
in
a
person
of
his
high
rank
that
cajoled
the
who
looked
on
him
as
their
god
their
deliverer
and
all
that
was
sacred
and
dear
to
them
but
the
wiser
sort
regarded
him
only
as
one
that
had
most
power
and
pretension
to
turn
the
whole
affairs
of
which
they
disliking
were
willing
at
any
price
to
reduce
to
their
own
conditions
and
to
what
they
desired
not
imagining
he
would
have
laid
a
claim
to
the
crown
which
many
of
them
fancied
themselves
as
capable
of
as
himself
rather
that
he
would
perhaps
have
set
up
the
king
of
this
knew
and
understanding
their
sentiments
was
unwilling
to
hinder
their
joining
with
him
by
such
a
declaration
which
he
knew
would
be
a
means
to
turn
abundance
of
hearts
against
him
as
indeed
it
fell
out
and
he
found
himself
master
of
some
few
towns
only
with
an
army
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
thousand
peasants
ill
armed
unused
to
war
watchings
and
very
ill
lodging
in
the
field
very
badly
victualled
and
worse
paid
for
from
no
aids
of
any
kind
could
be
brought
him
the
roads
all
along
being
so
well
guarded
and
secured
by
the
royal
forces
and
wanting
some
great
persons
to
espouse
his
quarrel
made
him
not
only
despair
of
success
but
highly
resent
it
of
those
who
had
given
him
so
large
promises
of
aid
many
as
i
said
and
most
were
disgusted
with
his
title
of
king
but
some
waited
the
success
of
his
first
battle
which
was
every
day
expected
though
kept
himself
as
clear
of
the
royal
army
as
he
could
a
long
time
marching
away
as
soon
as
they
drew
near
hoping
by
these
means
not
only
to
tire
them
out
and
watch
an
advantage
when
to
engage
but
gather
still
more
numbers
so
that
the
greatest
mischief
he
did
was
teasing
the
royal
army
who
could
never
tell
where
to
have
him
so
dexterous
he
was
in
marching
off
they
often
came
so
near
as
to
have
skirmishes
with
one
another
by
small
parties
where
some
few
men
would
fall
on
both
sides
and
to
say
truth
in
this
expedition
shewed
much
more
of
a
soldier
than
the
politician
his
skill
was
great
his
conduct
good
expert
in
advantages
and
indefatigable
in
toils
and
i
have
heard
it
from
the
mouth
of
a
gentleman
who
in
all
that
undertaking
never
was
from
him
that
in
seven
or
eight
weeks
that
he
was
in
arms
he
never
absolutely
undressed
himself
and
hardly
slept
an
hour
in
the
four
and
twenty
and
that
sometimes
he
was
on
his
horse
s
back
in
a
chariot
or
on
the
ground
suffering
even
with
the
meanest
of
his
soldiers
all
the
fatigues
of
the
enterprise
this
gentleman
told
me
he
would
in
those
hours
he
should
sleep
and
wherein
he
was
not
taking
measures
and
councils
which
were
always
held
in
the
night
that
he
would
be
eternally
speaking
to
him
of
and
that
with
the
softest
concern
it
was
possible
for
love
and
tenderest
passion
to
express
that
he
being
the
only
friend
he
could
repose
so
great
a
weakness
in
and
who
soothed
him
to
the
degree
he
wished
the
prince
was
so
well
pleased
with
him
as
to
establish
him
a
colonel
of
horse
for
no
other
merit
than
that
of
having
once
served
and
now
would
flatter
his
disease
agreeably
and
though
he
did
so
he
protested
he
was
ashamed
to
hear
how
this
poor
fond
concern
rendered
this
great
man
and
he
has
often
pitied
what
should
have
been
else
admired
but
who
can
tell
the
force
of
love
backed
by
charms
supernatural
and
who
is
it
that
will
not
sigh
at
the
fate
of
so
illustrious
a
young
man
whom
love
had
rendered
the
most
miserable
of
all
those
numbers
he
led
but
now
the
royal
army
as
if
they
had
purposely
suffered
him
to
take
his
tour
about
the
country
to
ensnare
him
with
the
more
facility
had
at
last
by
new
forces
that
came
to
their
assistance
daily
so
encompassed
him
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
avoid
any
longer
giving
them
battle
however
he
had
the
benefit
of
posting
himself
the
most
advantageously
that
he
could
wish
he
had
the
rising
grounds
to
place
his
cannon
and
all
things
concurred
to
give
him
success
his
numbers
exceeding
those
of
the
royal
army
not
but
he
would
have
avoided
a
set
battle
if
it
had
been
possible
till
he
had
made
himself
master
of
some
places
of
stronger
hold
for
yet
as
i
said
he
had
only
subdued
some
inconsiderable
places
which
were
not
able
to
make
defence
and
which
as
soon
as
he
was
marched
out
surrendered
again
to
their
lawful
prince
and
pulling
down
his
proclamation
put
up
those
of
the
king
but
he
was
on
all
sides
so
embarrassed
he
could
not
come
even
to
parly
with
any
town
of
note
so
that
as
i
said
at
last
being
as
it
were
blocked
up
though
the
royal
army
did
not
offer
him
battle
three
nights
they
lay
thus
in
view
of
each
other
the
first
night
the
prince
sent
out
his
scouts
who
brought
him
intelligence
that
the
enemy
was
not
so
well
prepared
for
battle
as
they
feared
they
might
be
if
they
imagined
the
prince
would
engage
them
but
he
had
so
often
given
them
the
slip
that
they
believed
he
had
no
mind
to
put
the
fortune
of
the
day
to
the
push
and
they
were
glad
of
these
delays
that
new
forces
might
advance
when
the
scouts
returned
with
this
news
the
prince
was
impatient
to
fall
upon
the
enemy
but
who
was
continually
taking
counsel
of
his
charms
and
looking
into
his
black
book
of
fate
for
every
sally
and
step
they
made
persuaded
his
highness
to
have
a
little
patience
positively
assuring
him
his
fortune
depended
on
a
critical
minute
which
was
not
yet
come
and
that
if
he
offered
to
give
battle
before
the
change
of
the
moon
he
was
inevitably
lost
and
that
the
attendance
of
that
fortunate
moment
would
be
the
beginning
of
those
of
his
whole
life
with
such
like
positive
persuasions
he
gained
upon
the
prince
and
overcame
his
impatience
of
engaging
for
that
night
all
which
he
passed
in
counsel
without
being
persuaded
to
take
any
rest
often
blaming
the
nicety
of
their
art
and
his
stars
and
often
asking
if
they
lost
that
opportunity
that
fortune
had
now
given
them
whether
all
their
arts
or
stars
or
devils
could
retrieve
it
and
nothing
would
that
night
appease
him
or
dispossess
the
sorcerers
of
this
opinion
the
next
day
they
received
certain
intelligence
that
a
considerable
supply
would
reinforce
the
royal
army
under
the
conduct
of
a
prince
of
the
blood
which
were
every
moment
expected
this
news
made
the
prince
rave
and
he
broke
out
into
all
the
rage
imaginable
against
the
wizards
who
defended
themselves
with
all
the
reasons
of
their
art
but
it
was
all
in
vain
and
he
vowed
he
would
that
night
engage
the
enemy
if
he
found
but
one
faithful
friend
to
second
him
though
he
died
in
the
attempt
that
he
was
worn
out
with
the
toils
he
had
undergone
harassed
almost
to
death
and
would
wait
no
longer
the
approach
of
his
lazy
fate
but
boldly
advancing
meet
it
what
face
so
ever
it
bore
they
besought
him
on
their
knees
he
would
not
overthrow
the
glorious
design
so
long
in
bringing
to
perfection
just
in
the
very
minute
of
happy
projection
but
to
wait
those
certain
fates
that
would
bring
him
glory
and
honour
on
their
wings
and
who
if
slighted
would
abandon
him
to
destruction
it
was
but
some
few
hours
more
and
then
they
were
his
own
to
be
commanded
by
him
it
was
thus
they
drilled
and
delayed
him
on
till
night
when
again
he
sent
out
his
scouts
to
discover
the
posture
of
the
enemy
and
himself
in
the
mean
time
went
to
council
failed
not
to
be
sent
for
thither
who
sometimes
feigned
excuses
to
keep
away
and
when
he
did
come
he
sat
unconcerned
neither
giving
or
receiving
any
advice
this
was
taken
notice
of
by
all
but
who
looked
upon
it
as
being
overwatched
and
fatigued
with
the
toils
of
the
day
his
sullenness
did
not
pass
so
in
the
opinion
of
the
rest
they
saw
or
at
least
thought
they
saw
some
other
marks
of
discontent
in
his
fine
eyes
which
love
so
much
better
became
one
of
the
prince
s
officers
and
captain
of
his
guard
who
was
an
old
hereditary
rogue
and
whose
father
had
suffered
in
rebellion
before
a
fellow
rough
and
daring
comes
boldly
to
the
prince
when
the
council
rose
and
asked
him
if
he
were
resolved
to
engage
he
told
him
he
was
then
said
he
give
me
leave
to
shoot
in
the
this
blunt
proposition
given
without
any
manner
of
reason
or
circumstance
made
the
prince
start
back
a
step
or
two
and
ask
him
his
meaning
of
what
he
said
replied
the
captain
if
you
will
be
safe
must
die
for
however
it
appear
to
your
highness
to
all
the
camp
he
shows
the
traitor
and
it
is
more
than
doubted
he
and
the
king
of
understand
one
another
but
too
well
therefore
if
you
would
be
victor
let
him
be
dispatched
and
i
myself
will
undertake
said
the
prince
if
i
could
believe
what
you
say
to
be
true
i
should
not
take
so
base
a
revenge
i
would
fight
like
a
soldier
and
he
should
be
treated
like
a
man
of
sir
said
for
that
was
the
captain
s
name
do
not
in
the
circumstances
we
are
now
in
talk
of
treating
with
those
that
would
betray
us
like
men
of
honour
we
can
not
stand
upon
decency
in
killing
who
have
so
many
to
dispatch
we
came
not
into
to
fight
duels
and
stand
on
nice
punctilios
i
say
we
must
make
quick
work
and
i
have
a
good
pistol
charged
with
two
handsome
bullets
that
shall
as
soon
as
he
appears
amongst
us
on
horseback
do
his
business
as
genteelly
as
can
be
and
rid
you
of
one
of
the
most
powerful
of
your
to
this
the
prince
would
by
no
means
agree
not
believing
one
syllable
of
the
accusation
swore
then
that
he
would
not
draw
a
sword
for
his
service
while
was
suffered
to
live
and
he
was
as
good
as
his
word
he
said
in
going
out
that
he
would
obey
the
prince
but
he
begged
his
pardon
if
he
did
not
lift
a
hand
on
his
side
and
in
an
hour
after
sent
him
his
commission
and
waited
on
him
and
was
with
him
almost
till
the
last
in
all
the
danger
but
would
not
fight
having
made
a
solemn
vow
several
others
were
of
opinion
but
the
prince
believed
nothing
of
it
being
indeed
as
he
said
weary
of
the
design
and
party
and
regarded
them
as
his
ruiners
who
with
fair
pretences
drew
him
into
a
bad
cause
which
his
youth
had
not
then
considered
and
from
which
he
could
not
untangle
himself
by
this
time
the
scout
was
come
back
who
informed
the
prince
that
now
was
the
best
time
in
the
world
to
attack
the
enemy
who
all
lay
supinely
in
their
tents
and
did
not
expect
a
surprise
that
the
very
were
slender
and
that
it
would
not
be
hard
to
put
them
to
a
great
deal
of
confusion
the
prince
who
was
enough
impatient
before
now
was
all
fire
and
spirit
and
it
was
not
in
the
power
of
magic
to
withhold
him
but
hasting
immediately
to
horse
with
as
much
speed
as
possible
he
got
at
the
head
of
his
men
and
marching
on
directly
to
the
enemy
put
them
into
so
great
a
surprise
that
it
may
be
admired
how
they
got
themselves
into
a
condition
of
defence
and
to
make
short
of
a
business
that
was
not
long
in
acting
i
may
avow
nothing
but
the
immediate
hand
of
the
almighty
who
favours
the
juster
side
and
is
always
ready
for
the
support
of
those
who
approach
so
near
his
own
divinity
sacred
and
anointed
heads
could
have
turned
the
fortune
of
the
battle
to
the
royal
side
it
was
prodigious
to
consider
the
unequal
numbers
and
the
advantage
all
on
the
prince
s
part
it
was
miraculous
to
behold
the
order
on
his
side
and
surprise
on
the
other
which
of
itself
had
been
sufficient
to
have
confounded
them
yet
notwithstanding
all
this
unpreparedness
on
this
side
and
the
watchfulness
and
care
on
the
other
so
well
the
general
and
officers
of
the
royal
army
managed
their
scanted
time
so
bravely
disciplined
and
experienced
the
soldiers
were
so
resolute
and
brave
and
all
so
well
mounted
and
armed
that
as
i
said
to
a
miracle
they
fought
and
it
was
a
miracle
they
won
the
field
though
that
fatal
night
did
in
his
own
person
wonders
and
when
his
horse
was
killed
under
him
he
took
a
partisan
and
as
a
common
soldier
at
the
head
of
his
foot
acted
the
with
as
much
courage
and
bravery
as
ever
himself
could
boast
yet
all
this
availed
him
nothing
he
saw
himself
abandoned
on
all
sides
and
then
under
the
covert
of
the
night
he
retired
from
the
battle
with
his
sword
in
his
hand
with
only
one
page
who
fought
by
his
side
a
thousand
times
he
was
about
to
fall
on
his
own
sword
and
like
have
finished
a
life
he
could
no
longer
sustain
with
glory
but
love
that
coward
of
the
mind
and
the
image
of
divine
as
he
esteemed
her
still
gave
him
love
to
life
and
while
he
could
remember
she
yet
lived
to
charm
him
he
could
even
look
with
contempt
on
the
loss
of
all
his
glory
at
which
if
he
repined
it
was
for
her
sake
who
expected
to
behold
him
return
covered
over
with
laurels
in
these
sad
thoughts
he
wandered
as
long
as
his
wearied
legs
would
bear
him
into
a
low
forest
far
from
the
camp
where
with
toil
all
over
pain
and
a
royal
heart
even
breaking
with
anxiety
he
laid
him
down
under
the
shelter
of
a
tree
and
found
but
his
length
of
earth
left
to
support
him
now
who
not
many
hours
before
beheld
himself
the
greatest
monarch
as
he
imagined
in
the
world
oh
who
that
had
seen
him
thus
which
of
his
most
mortal
enemies
that
had
viewed
the
royal
youth
adorned
with
all
the
charms
of
beauty
heaven
ever
distributed
to
man
born
great
and
but
now
adored
by
all
the
crowding
world
with
hat
and
knee
now
abandoned
by
all
but
one
kind
trembling
boy
weeping
by
his
side
while
the
illustrious
lay
gazing
with
melancholy
weeping
eyes
at
those
stars
that
had
lately
been
so
cruel
to
him
sighing
out
his
great
soul
to
the
winds
that
whistled
round
his
uncovered
head
breathing
his
griefs
as
silently
as
the
sad
fatal
night
passed
away
where
nothing
in
nature
seemed
to
pity
him
but
the
poor
wretched
youth
that
kneeled
by
him
and
the
sighing
air
i
say
who
that
beheld
this
would
not
have
scorned
the
world
and
all
its
fickle
worshippers
have
cursed
the
flatteries
of
vain
ambition
and
prized
a
cottage
far
above
a
throne
a
garland
wreathed
by
some
fair
innocent
hand
before
the
restless
glories
of
a
crown
some
authors
in
the
relation
of
this
battle
affirm
that
quitted
his
post
as
soon
as
the
charge
was
given
and
sheered
off
from
that
wing
he
commanded
but
all
historians
agree
in
this
point
that
if
he
did
it
was
not
for
want
of
courage
for
in
a
thousand
encounters
he
has
given
sufficient
proofs
of
as
much
bravery
as
a
man
can
be
capable
of
but
he
disliked
the
cause
disapproved
of
all
their
pretensions
and
looked
upon
the
whole
affair
and
proceeding
to
be
most
unjust
and
ungenerous
and
all
the
fault
his
greatest
enemies
could
charge
him
with
was
that
he
did
not
deal
so
gratefully
with
a
prince
that
loved
him
and
trusted
him
and
that
he
ought
frankly
to
have
told
him
he
would
not
serve
him
in
this
design
and
that
it
had
been
more
gallant
to
have
quitted
him
that
way
than
this
but
there
are
so
many
reasons
to
be
given
for
this
more
politic
and
safe
deceit
than
are
needful
in
this
place
and
it
is
most
certain
as
it
is
the
most
justifiable
to
heaven
and
man
to
one
born
a
subject
of
and
having
sworn
allegiance
to
his
proper
king
to
abandon
any
other
interest
so
let
the
enemies
of
this
great
man
say
what
they
please
if
a
man
be
obliged
to
be
false
to
this
or
that
interest
i
think
no
body
of
common
honesty
sense
and
honour
will
dispute
which
he
ought
to
abandon
and
this
is
most
certain
that
he
did
not
forsake
him
because
fortune
did
so
as
this
one
instance
may
make
appear
when
was
first
proclaimed
king
and
had
all
the
reason
in
the
world
to
believe
that
fortune
would
have
been
wholly
partial
to
him
he
offered
his
choice
of
any
principality
and
government
in
and
to
have
made
him
of
the
order
of
all
which
he
refused
though
he
knew
his
great
fortune
was
lost
and
already
distributed
to
favourites
at
court
and
himself
proscribed
and
convicted
as
a
traitor
to
yet
all
these
refusals
did
not
open
the
eyes
of
this
credulous
great
young
man
who
still
believed
it
the
sullenness
and
generosity
of
his
temper
no
sooner
did
the
day
discover
to
the
world
the
horrid
business
of
the
preceding
night
but
a
diligent
search
was
made
among
the
infinite
number
of
dead
that
covered
the
face
of
the
earth
for
the
body
of
the
prince
or
new
king
as
they
called
him
but
when
they
could
not
find
him
among
the
dead
they
sent
out
parties
all
ways
to
search
the
woods
the
forests
and
the
plains
nor
was
it
long
they
sought
in
vain
for
he
who
had
laid
himself
as
i
said
under
the
shelter
of
a
tree
had
not
for
any
consideration
removed
him
but
finding
himself
seized
by
a
common
hand
suffered
himself
without
resistance
to
be
detained
by
one
single
man
till
more
advanced
when
he
could
as
easily
have
killed
the
rustic
as
speak
or
move
an
action
so
below
the
character
of
this
truly
brave
man
that
there
is
no
reason
to
be
given
to
excuse
his
easy
submission
but
this
that
he
was
stupefied
with
long
watching
grief
and
the
fatigues
of
his
daily
toil
for
so
many
weeks
before
for
it
is
not
to
be
imagined
it
was
carelessness
or
little
regard
for
life
for
if
it
had
been
so
he
would
doubtless
have
lost
it
nobly
with
the
victory
and
never
have
retreated
while
there
had
been
one
sword
left
advanced
against
him
or
if
he
had
disdained
the
enemy
should
have
had
the
advantage
and
glory
of
so
great
a
conquest
at
least
when
his
sword
had
been
yet
left
him
he
should
have
died
like
a
and
have
scorned
to
have
added
to
the
triumph
of
the
enemy
but
love
had
unmanned
his
great
soul
and
pleaded
within
for
life
at
any
price
even
that
of
all
his
glory
the
thought
of
her
alone
blackened
this
last
scene
of
his
life
and
for
which
all
his
past
triumphs
could
never
atone
nor
excuse
thus
taken
he
suffered
himself
to
be
led
away
tamely
by
common
hands
without
resistance
a
victim
now
even
fallen
to
the
pity
of
the
as
he
passed
and
so
little
imagined
by
the
better
sort
who
saw
him
not
they
would
not
give
a
credit
to
it
every
one
affirming
and
laying
wagers
he
would
die
like
a
hero
and
never
surrender
with
life
to
the
conqueror
but
this
submission
was
but
too
true
for
the
repose
of
all
his
abettors
nor
was
his
mean
surrender
all
but
he
shewed
a
dejection
all
the
way
they
were
bringing
him
to
so
extremely
unworthy
of
his
character
that
it
is
hardly
to
be
credited
so
great
a
change
could
have
been
possible
and
to
shew
that
he
had
lost
all
his
spirit
and
courage
with
the
victory
and
that
the
great
strings
of
his
heart
were
broke
the
captain
who
had
the
charge
of
him
and
commanded
that
little
squadron
that
conducted
him
to
related
to
me
this
remarkable
passage
in
the
journey
he
said
that
they
lodged
in
an
inn
where
he
believed
both
the
master
and
a
great
many
strangers
who
that
night
lodged
there
were
and
great
lovers
of
the
prince
which
the
captain
did
not
know
till
after
the
lodgings
were
taken
however
he
ordered
a
file
of
musketeers
to
guard
the
door
and
himself
only
remaining
in
the
chamber
with
the
prince
while
supper
was
getting
ready
the
captain
being
extremely
weary
with
watching
and
toiling
for
a
long
time
together
laid
himself
down
on
a
bench
behind
a
great
long
table
that
was
fastened
to
the
floor
and
had
unadvisedly
laid
his
pistols
on
the
table
and
though
he
durst
not
sleep
he
thought
there
to
stretch
himself
into
a
little
ease
who
had
not
quitted
his
horseback
in
a
great
while
the
prince
who
was
walking
with
his
arms
about
the
room
musing
in
a
very
dejected
posture
often
casting
his
eyes
to
the
door
at
last
advances
to
the
table
and
takes
up
the
captain
s
pistols
the
while
he
who
saw
him
advance
feared
in
that
moment
what
the
prince
was
going
to
do
he
thought
if
he
should
rise
and
snatch
at
the
pistols
and
miss
of
them
it
would
express
so
great
a
distrust
of
the
prince
it
might
provoke
him
to
do
what
by
his
generous
submitting
of
them
might
make
him
escape
and
therefore
since
it
was
too
late
he
suffered
the
prince
to
arm
himself
with
two
pistols
who
before
was
disarmed
of
even
his
little
penknife
he
was
he
said
a
thousand
times
about
to
call
out
to
the
guards
but
then
he
thought
before
they
could
enter
to
his
relief
he
was
sure
to
be
shot
dead
and
it
was
possible
the
prince
might
make
his
party
good
with
four
or
five
common
soldiers
who
perhaps
loved
the
prince
as
well
as
any
and
might
rather
assist
than
hinder
his
flight
all
this
he
thought
in
an
instant
and
at
the
same
time
seeing
the
prince
stand
still
in
a
kind
of
consideration
what
to
do
looking
turning
and
viewing
of
the
pistols
he
doubted
not
but
his
thoughts
would
determine
with
his
life
and
though
he
had
been
in
the
heat
of
all
the
battle
and
had
looked
death
in
the
face
when
it
appeared
most
horrid
he
protested
he
knew
not
how
to
fear
till
this
moment
and
that
now
he
trembled
with
the
apprehension
of
unavoidable
ruin
he
cursed
a
thousand
times
his
unadvisedness
now
it
was
too
late
he
saw
the
prince
after
he
had
viewed
and
reviewed
the
pistols
walk
in
a
great
thoughtfulness
again
about
the
chamber
and
at
last
as
if
he
had
determined
what
to
do
came
back
and
laid
them
again
on
the
table
at
which
the
captain
snatched
them
up
resolving
never
to
commit
so
great
an
more
he
did
not
doubt
he
said
but
the
prince
in
taking
them
up
had
some
design
of
making
his
escape
and
most
certainly
if
he
had
but
had
courage
to
have
attempted
it
it
had
not
been
hard
to
have
been
accomplished
at
worst
he
could
but
have
died
but
there
is
a
fate
that
the
most
lucky
minutes
of
the
greatest
men
in
the
world
and
turns
even
all
advantages
offered
to
misfortunes
when
it
designs
their
ruin
while
they
were
on
their
way
to
he
gave
some
more
signs
that
the
misfortunes
he
had
suffered
had
lessened
his
heart
and
courage
he
writ
several
the
most
submissive
letters
in
the
world
to
the
king
and
to
the
of
wherein
he
strove
to
mitigate
his
treason
with
the
poorest
arguments
imaginable
and
as
if
his
good
sense
had
declined
with
his
fortune
his
style
was
altered
and
debased
to
that
of
a
common
man
or
rather
a
schoolboy
filled
with
tautologies
and
stuff
of
no
coherence
in
which
he
neither
shewed
the
majesty
of
a
prince
nor
sense
of
a
gentleman
as
i
could
make
appear
by
exposing
those
copies
which
i
leave
to
history
all
which
must
be
imputed
to
the
disorder
his
head
and
heart
were
in
for
want
of
that
natural
rest
he
never
after
found
when
he
came
to
he
fell
at
the
feet
of
his
majesty
to
whom
they
brought
him
and
with
a
shower
of
tears
bedewing
his
shoes
as
he
lay
prostrate
besought
his
pardon
and
asked
his
life
perhaps
one
of
his
greatest
weaknesses
to
imagine
he
could
hope
for
mercy
after
so
many
pardons
for
the
same
fault
and
which
if
he
had
had
but
one
grain
of
that
bravery
left
him
he
was
wont
to
be
master
of
he
could
not
have
expected
nor
have
had
the
confidence
to
have
implored
and
he
was
a
poor
spectacle
of
pity
to
all
that
once
adored
him
to
see
how
he
petitioned
in
vain
for
life
which
if
it
had
been
granted
had
been
of
no
other
use
to
him
but
to
have
passed
in
some
corner
of
the
earth
with
despised
by
all
the
rest
and
though
he
fetched
tears
of
pity
from
the
eyes
of
the
best
and
most
merciful
of
kings
he
could
not
gain
on
his
first
resolution
which
was
never
to
forgive
him
that
scurrilous
declaration
he
had
dispersed
at
his
first
landing
in
that
he
took
upon
him
the
title
of
king
he
could
forgive
that
he
had
been
the
cause
of
so
much
bloodshed
he
could
forgive
but
never
that
unworthy
scandal
on
his
unspotted
fame
of
which
he
was
much
more
nice
than
of
his
crown
or
life
and
left
him
as
he
told
him
this
prostrate
on
the
earth
when
the
guards
took
him
up
and
conveyed
him
to
the
as
he
came
out
of
the
it
is
said
he
looked
with
his
wonted
grace
only
a
languishment
sat
there
in
greater
beauty
than
possibly
all
his
gayer
looks
ever
put
on
at
least
in
his
circumstances
all
that
beheld
him
imagined
so
all
the
were
crowded
in
vast
numbers
to
see
him
and
oh
see
what
fortune
is
those
that
had
vowed
him
allegiance
in
their
hearts
and
were
upon
all
occasions
ready
to
rise
in
mutiny
for
his
least
interest
now
saw
him
and
suffered
him
to
be
carried
to
the
with
a
small
company
of
guards
and
never
offered
to
rescue
the
royal
unfortunate
from
the
hands
of
justice
while
he
viewed
them
all
around
with
scorning
dying
eyes
while
he
remained
in
the
he
was
visited
by
several
of
the
ministers
of
state
and
cardinals
and
men
of
the
church
who
urged
him
to
some
discoveries
but
could
not
prevail
with
him
he
spoke
he
thought
he
dreamed
of
nothing
but
and
when
they
talked
of
heaven
he
ran
on
some
discourse
of
that
beauty
something
of
her
praise
and
so
continued
to
his
last
moment
even
on
the
scaffold
where
when
he
was
urged
to
excuse
as
a
good
christian
ought
his
invasion
his
bloodshed
and
his
unnatural
war
he
set
himself
to
justify
his
passion
to
endeavouring
to
render
the
life
he
had
led
with
her
innocent
and
blameless
in
the
sight
of
heaven
and
all
the
churchmen
could
persuade
could
make
him
speak
of
very
little
else
just
before
he
laid
himself
down
on
the
block
he
called
to
one
of
the
gentlemen
of
his
chamber
and
taking
out
the
enchanted
he
whispered
him
in
the
ear
and
commanded
him
to
bear
it
from
him
to
and
laying
himself
down
suffered
the
justice
of
the
law
and
died
more
pitied
than
lamented
so
that
it
became
a
proverb
if
i
have
an
enemy
i
wish
he
may
live
like
and
die
like
so
ended
the
race
of
this
glorious
youth
who
was
in
his
time
the
greatest
man
of
a
subject
in
the
world
and
the
greatest
favourite
of
his
prince
happy
indeed
above
a
monarch
if
ambition
and
the
inspiration
of
knaves
and
fools
had
not
led
him
to
destruction
and
from
a
glorious
life
brought
him
to
a
shameful
death
this
deplorable
news
was
not
long
in
coming
to
who
must
receive
this
due
that
when
she
heard
her
was
dead
and
with
him
all
her
dearer
greatness
gone
she
betook
herself
to
her
bed
and
made
a
vow
she
would
never
rise
nor
eat
more
and
she
was
as
good
as
her
word
she
lay
in
that
melancholy
estate
about
ten
days
making
the
most
piteous
moan
for
her
dead
lover
that
ever
was
heard
drowning
her
pillow
in
tears
and
sighing
out
her
soul
she
called
on
him
in
vain
as
long
as
she
could
speak
at
last
she
fell
into
a
lethargy
and
dreamed
of
him
till
she
could
dream
no
more
an
everlasting
sleep
