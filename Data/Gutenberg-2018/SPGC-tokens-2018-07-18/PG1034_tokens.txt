introduction
in
writing
an
introduction
such
as
this
it
is
good
to
be
brief
the
poems
printed
in
this
book
need
no
preliminary
commendations
from
me
or
anyone
else
the
author
has
left
us
his
own
fragmentary
but
impressive
foreword
this
and
his
poems
can
speak
for
him
backed
by
the
authority
of
his
experience
as
an
infantry
soldier
and
sustained
by
nobility
and
originality
of
style
all
that
was
strongest
in
wilfred
owen
survives
in
his
poems
any
superficial
impressions
of
his
personality
any
records
of
his
conversation
behaviour
or
appearance
would
be
irrelevant
and
unseemly
the
curiosity
which
demands
such
morsels
would
be
incapable
of
appreciating
the
richness
of
his
work
the
discussion
of
his
experiments
in
assonance
and
dissonance
of
which
meeting
is
the
finest
example
may
be
left
to
the
professional
critics
of
verse
the
majority
of
whom
will
be
more
preoccupied
with
such
technical
details
than
with
the
profound
humanity
of
the
revelation
manifested
in
such
magnificent
lines
as
those
at
the
end
of
his
pro
poemate
meo
and
in
that
other
poem
which
he
named
love
the
importance
of
his
contribution
to
the
literature
of
the
war
can
not
be
decided
by
those
who
like
myself
both
admired
him
as
a
poet
and
valued
him
as
a
friend
his
conclusions
about
war
are
so
entirely
in
accordance
with
my
own
that
i
can
not
attempt
to
judge
his
work
with
any
critical
detachment
i
can
only
affirm
that
he
was
a
man
of
absolute
integrity
of
mind
he
never
wrote
his
poems
as
so
many
did
to
make
the
effect
of
a
personal
gesture
he
pitied
others
he
did
not
pity
himself
in
the
last
year
of
his
life
he
attained
a
clear
vision
of
what
he
needed
to
say
and
these
poems
survive
him
as
his
true
and
splendid
testament

in
order
to
help
these
boys
directly
by
leading
them
as
well
as
an
officer
can
indirectly
by
watching
their
sufferings
that
i
may
speak
of
them

well
as

preface
this
book
is
not
about
heroes
english
poetry
is
not
yet
fit
to
speak
of
them
nor
is
it
about
deeds
or
lands
nor
anything
about
glory
honour
dominion
or
power
except
war
above
all
this
book
is
not
concerned
with
poetry
the
subject
of
it
is
war
and
the
pity
of
war
the
poetry
is
in
the
pity
yet
these
elegies
are
not
to
this
generation
this
is
in
no
sense
consolatory
they
may
be
to
the
next
all
the
poet
can
do
is
to
warn
that
is
why
the
true
poets
must
be
truthful
if
i
thought
the
letter
of
this
book
would
last
i
might
have
used
proper
names
but
if
the
spirit
of
it
survives
prussia
my
ambition
and
those
names
will
be
content
for
they
will
have
achieved
themselves

fields
than
flanders

strange
meeting
it
seemed
that
out
of
the
battle
i
escaped
down
some
profound
dull
tunnel
long
since
scooped
through
granites
which
titanic
wars
had
groined
yet
also
there
encumbered
sleepers
groaned
too
fast
in
thought
or
death
to
be
bestirred
then
as
i
probed
them
one
sprang
up
and
stared
with
piteous
recognition
in
fixed
eyes
lifting
distressful
hands
as
if
to
bless
and
by
his
smile
i
knew
that
sullen
hall
with
a
thousand
fears
that
vision
face
was
grained
yet
no
blood
reached
there
from
the
upper
ground
and
no
guns
thumped
or
down
the
flues
made
moan
strange
friend
i
said
here
is
no
cause
to
mourn
none
said
the
other
save
the
undone
years
the
hopelessness
whatever
hope
is
yours
was
my
life
also
i
went
hunting
wild
after
the
wildest
beauty
in
the
world
which
lies
not
calm
in
eyes
or
braided
hair
but
mocks
the
steady
running
of
the
hour
and
if
it
grieves
grieves
richlier
than
here
for
by
my
glee
might
many
men
have
laughed
and
of
my
weeping
something
has
been
left
which
must
die
now
i
mean
the
truth
untold
the
pity
of
war
the
pity
war
distilled
now
men
will
go
content
with
what
we
spoiled
or
discontent
boil
bloody
and
be
spilled
they
will
be
swift
with
swiftness
of
the
tigress
none
will
break
ranks
though
nations
trek
from
progress
courage
was
mine
and
i
had
mystery
wisdom
was
mine
and
i
had
mastery
to
miss
the
march
of
this
retreating
world
into
vain
citadels
that
are
not
walled
then
when
much
blood
had
clogged
their
i
would
go
up
and
wash
them
from
sweet
wells
even
with
truths
that
lie
too
deep
for
taint
i
would
have
poured
my
spirit
without
stint
but
not
through
wounds
not
on
the
cess
of
war
foreheads
of
men
have
bled
where
no
wounds
were
i
am
the
enemy
you
killed
my
friend
i
knew
you
in
this
dark
for
so
you
frowned
yesterday
through
me
as
you
jabbed
and
killed
i
parried
but
my
hands
were
loath
and
cold
let
us
sleep
now
this
poem
was
found
among
the
author
papers
it
ends
on
this
strange
note
earth
wheels
run
oiled
with
blood
forget
we
that
let
us
lie
down
and
dig
ourselves
in
thought
beauty
is
yours
and
you
have
mastery
wisdom
is
mine
and
i
have
mystery
we
two
will
stay
behind
and
keep
our
troth
let
us
forego
men
minds
that
are
brute
natures
let
us
not
sup
the
blood
which
some
say
nurtures
be
we
not
swift
with
swiftness
of
the
tigress
let
us
break
ranks
from
those
who
trek
from
progress
miss
we
the
march
of
this
retreating
world
into
old
citadels
that
are
not
walled
let
us
lie
out
and
hold
the
open
truth
then
when
their
blood
hath
clogged
the
chariot
wheels
we
will
go
up
and
wash
them
from
deep
wells
what
though
we
sink
from
men
as
pitchers
falling
many
shall
raise
us
up
to
be
their
filling
even
from
wells
we
sunk
too
deep
for
war
and
filled
by
brows
that
bled
where
no
wounds
were
line
even
as
one
who
bled
where
no
wounds
were
greater
love
red
lips
are
not
so
red
as
the
stained
stones
kissed
by
the
english
dead
kindness
of
wooed
and
wooer
seems
shame
to
their
love
pure
o
love
your
eyes
lose
lure
when
i
behold
eyes
blinded
in
my
stead
your
slender
attitude
trembles
not
exquisite
like
limbs
rolling
and
rolling
there
where
god
seems
not
to
care
till
the
fierce
love
they
bear
cramps
them
in
death
extreme
decrepitude
your
voice
sings
not
so
soft
though
even
as
wind
murmuring
through
raftered
loft
your
dear
voice
is
not
dear
gentle
and
evening
clear
as
theirs
whom
none
now
hear
now
earth
has
stopped
their
piteous
mouths
that
coughed
heart
you
were
never
hot
nor
large
nor
full
like
hearts
made
great
with
shot
and
though
your
hand
be
pale
paler
are
all
which
trail
your
cross
through
flame
and
hail
weep
you
may
weep
for
you
may
touch
them
not
apologia
pro
poemate
meo
i
too
saw
god
through
mud
the
mud
that
cracked
on
cheeks
when
wretches
smiled
war
brought
more
glory
to
their
eyes
than
blood
and
gave
their
laughs
more
glee
than
shakes
a
child
merry
it
was
to
laugh
there
where
death
becomes
absurd
and
life
absurder
for
power
was
on
us
as
we
slashed
bones
bare
not
to
feel
sickness
or
remorse
of
murder
i
too
have
dropped
off
fear
behind
the
barrage
dead
as
my
platoon
and
sailed
my
spirit
surging
light
and
clear
past
the
entanglement
where
hopes
lay
strewn
and
witnessed
exultation
faces
that
used
to
curse
me
scowl
for
scowl
shine
and
lift
up
with
passion
of
oblation
seraphic
for
an
hour
though
they
were
foul
i
have
made
fellowships
untold
of
happy
lovers
in
old
song
for
love
is
not
the
binding
of
fair
lips
with
the
soft
silk
of
eyes
that
look
and
long
by
joy
whose
ribbon
slips
but
wound
with
war
hard
wire
whose
stakes
are
strong
bound
with
the
bandage
of
the
arm
that
drips
knit
in
the
welding
of
the
i
have
perceived
much
beauty
in
the
hoarse
oaths
that
kept
our
courage
straight
heard
music
in
the
silentness
of
duty
found
peace
where
spouted
reddest
spate
nevertheless
except
you
share
with
them
in
hell
the
sorrowful
dark
of
hell
whose
world
is
but
the
trembling
of
a
flare
and
heaven
but
as
the
highway
for
a
shell
you
shall
not
hear
their
mirth
you
shall
not
come
to
think
them
well
content
by
any
jest
of
mine
these
men
are
worth
your
tears
you
are
not
worth
their
merriment
november
the
show
my
soul
looked
down
from
a
vague
height
with
death
as
unremembering
how
i
rose
or
why
and
saw
a
sad
land
weak
with
sweats
of
dearth
gray
cratered
like
the
moon
with
hollow
woe
and
fitted
with
great
pocks
and
scabs
of
plaques
across
its
beard
that
horror
of
harsh
wire
there
moved
thin
caterpillars
slowly
uncoiled
it
seemed
they
pushed
themselves
to
be
as
plugs
of
ditches
where
they
writhed
and
shrivelled
killed
by
them
had
slimy
paths
been
trailed
and
scraped
round
myriad
warts
that
might
be
little
hills
from
gloom
last
dregs
these
creatures
crept
and
vanished
out
of
dawn
down
hidden
holes
and
smell
came
up
from
those
foul
openings
as
out
of
mouths
or
deep
wounds
deepening
on
dithering
feet
upgathered
more
and
more
brown
strings
towards
strings
of
gray
with
bristling
spines
all
migrants
from
green
fields
intent
on
mire
those
that
were
gray
of
more
abundant
spawns
ramped
on
the
rest
and
ate
them
and
were
eaten
i
saw
their
bitten
backs
curve
loop
and
straighten
i
watched
those
agonies
curl
lift
and
flatten
whereat
in
terror
what
that
sight
might
mean
i
reeled
and
shivered
earthward
like
a
feather
and
death
fell
with
me
like
a
deepening
moan
and
he
picking
a
manner
of
worm
which
half
had
hid
its
bruises
in
the
earth
but
crawled
no
further
showed
me
its
feet
the
feet
of
many
men
and
the
head
of
it
my
head
mental
cases
who
are
these
why
sit
they
here
in
twilight
wherefore
rock
they
purgatorial
shadows
drooping
tongues
from
jaws
that
slob
their
relish
baring
teeth
that
leer
like
skulls
tongues
wicked
stroke
on
stroke
of
pain
but
what
slow
panic
gouged
these
chasms
round
their
fretted
sockets
ever
from
their
hair
and
through
their
hand
palms
misery
swelters
surely
we
have
perished
sleeping
and
walk
hell
but
who
these
hellish
these
are
men
whose
minds
the
dead
have
ravished
memory
fingers
in
their
hair
of
murders
multitudinous
murders
they
once
witnessed
wading
sloughs
of
flesh
these
helpless
wander
treading
blood
from
lungs
that
had
loved
laughter
always
they
must
see
these
things
and
hear
them
batter
of
guns
and
shatter
of
flying
muscles
carnage
incomparable
and
human
squander
rucked
too
thick
for
these
men
extrication
therefore
still
their
eyeballs
shrink
tormented
back
into
their
brains
because
on
their
sense
sunlight
seems
a
bloodsmear
night
comes
dawn
breaks
open
like
a
wound
that
bleeds
afresh
thus
their
heads
wear
this
hilarious
hideous
awful
falseness
of
corpses
thus
their
hands
are
plucking
at
each
other
picking
at
the
of
their
scourging
snatching
after
us
who
smote
them
brother
pawing
us
who
dealt
them
war
and
madness
parable
of
the
old
men
and
the
young
so
abram
rose
and
clave
the
wood
and
went
and
took
the
fire
with
him
and
a
knife
and
as
they
sojourned
both
of
them
together
isaac
the
spake
and
said
my
father
behold
the
preparations
fire
and
iron
but
where
the
lamb
for
this
then
abram
bound
the
youth
with
belts
and
straps
and
builded
parapets
and
trenches
there
and
forth
the
knife
to
slay
his
son
when
lo
an
angel
called
him
out
of
heaven
saying
lay
not
thy
hand
upon
the
lad
neither
do
anything
to
him
behold
a
ram
caught
in
a
thicket
by
its
horns
offer
the
ram
of
pride
instead
of
him
but
the
old
man
would
not
so
but
slew
his
son
arms
and
the
boy
let
the
boy
try
along
this
how
cold
steel
is
and
keen
with
hunger
of
blood
blue
with
all
malice
like
a
madman
flash
and
thinly
drawn
with
famishing
for
flesh
lend
him
to
stroke
these
blind
blunt
which
long
to
muzzle
in
the
hearts
of
lads
or
give
him
cartridges
of
fine
zinc
teeth
sharp
with
the
sharpness
of
grief
and
death
for
his
teeth
seem
for
laughing
round
an
apple
there
lurk
no
claws
behind
his
fingers
supple
and
god
will
grow
no
talons
at
his
heels
nor
antlers
through
the
thickness
of
his
curls
anthem
for
doomed
youth
what
for
these
who
die
as
cattle
only
the
monstrous
anger
of
the
guns
only
the
stuttering
rifles
rapid
rattle
can
patter
out
their
hasty
orisons
no
mockeries
for
them
no
prayers
nor
bells
nor
any
voice
of
mourning
save
the
choirs
the
shrill
demented
choirs
of
wailing
shells
and
bugles
calling
for
them
from
sad
shires
what
candles
may
be
held
to
speed
them
all
not
in
the
hands
of
boys
but
in
their
eyes
shall
shine
the
holy
glimmers
of
goodbyes
the
pallor
of
girls
brows
shall
be
their
pall
their
flowers
the
tenderness
of
patient
minds
and
each
slow
dusk
a
of
blinds
the
down
the
close
darkening
lanes
they
sang
their
way
to
the
and
lined
the
train
with
faces
grimly
gay
their
breasts
were
stuck
all
white
with
wreath
and
spray
as
men
are
dead
dull
porters
watched
them
and
a
casual
tramp
stood
staring
hard
sorry
to
miss
them
from
the
upland
camp
then
unmoved
signals
nodded
and
a
lamp
winked
to
the
guard
so
secretly
like
wrongs
they
went
they
were
not
ours
we
never
heard
to
which
front
these
were
sent
nor
there
if
they
yet
mock
what
women
meant
who
gave
them
flowers
shall
they
return
to
beatings
of
great
bells
in
wild
trainloads
a
few
a
few
too
few
for
drums
and
yells
may
creep
back
silent
to
still
village
wells
up
roads
insensibility
i
happy
are
men
who
yet
before
they
are
killed
can
let
their
veins
run
cold
whom
no
compassion
fleers
or
makes

no

strange

are
these
who
lose

they
have
enough
to
carry

ammunition
their
spirit
drags
no

their
old
wounds
save
with
cold

their

the
hurt

the

remain

drawn
their
senses
in
some
scorching
cautery
of

laugh
among
the

unconcerned
iv
happy
the
soldier
home
with
not
a
notion
how
somewhere
every
dawn
some
men
attack
and
many
sighs
are
drained
happy
the
lad
whose
mind
was
never
trained
his
days
are
worth
forgetting
more
than
not
he
sings
along
the
march
which
we
march
taciturn
because
of
dusk
the
long
forlorn
relentless
trend
from
larger
day
to
huger
night
v
we
wise
who
with
a
thought
besmirch
blood
over
all
our
soul
how
should
we
see
our
task
but
through
his
blunt
and
lashless
eyes
alive
he
is
not
vital
overmuch
dying
not
mortal
overmuch
nor
sad
nor
proud
nor
curious
at
all
he
can
not
tell
old
men
placidity
from
his
vi
but
cursed
are
dullards
whom
no
cannon
stuns
that
they
should
be
as
stones
wretched
are
they
and
mean
with
paucity
that
never
was
simplicity
by
choice
they
made
themselves
immune
to
pity
and
whatever
mourns
in
man
before
the
last
sea
and
the
hapless
stars
whatever
mourns
when

shores

bent
double
like
old
beggars
under
sacks
coughing
like
hags
we
cursed
through
sludge
till
on
the
haunting
flares
we
turned
our
backs
and
towards
our
distant
rest
began
to
trudge
men
marched
asleep
many
had
lost
their
boots
but
limped
on
all
went
lame
all
blind
drunk
with
fatigue
deaf
even
to
the
hoots
of
dropping
softly
behind
gas
gas
quick
boys
an
ecstasy
of
fumbling
fitting
the
clumsy
helmets
just
in
time
but
someone
still
was
yelling
out
and
stumbling
and
like
a
man
in
fire
or
dim
through
the
misty
panes
and
thick
green
light
as
under
a
green
sea
i
saw
him
drowning
in
all
my
dreams
before
my
helpless
sight
he
plunges
at
me
guttering
choking
drowning
if
in
some
smothering
dreams
you
too
could
pace
behind
the
wagon
that
we
flung
him
in
and
watch
the
white
eyes
writhing
in
his
face
his
hanging
face
like
a
devil
sick
of
sin
if
you
could
hear
at
every
jolt
the
blood
come
gargling
from
the
lungs
bitter
as
the
cud
of
vile
incurable
sores
on
innocent
tongues
my
friend
you
would
not
tell
with
such
high
zest
to
children
ardent
for
some
desperate
glory
the
old
lie
dulce

decorum

pro

the
sentry
we
found
an
old
boche
and
he
knew
and
gave
us
hell
for
shell
on
frantic
shell
hammered
on
top
but
never
quite
burst
through
rain
guttering
down
in
waterfalls
of
slime
kept
slush
waist
high
that
rising
hour
by
hour
choked
up
the
steps
too
thick
with
clay
to
climb
what
murk
of
air
remained
stank
old
and
sour
with
fumes
of
and
the
smell
of
men
who
lived
there
years
and
left
their
curse
in
the
den
if
not
their
corpses
there
we
herded
from
the
blast
of
but
one
found
our
door
at
last
buffeting
eyes
and
breath
snuffing
the
candles
and
thud
flump
thud
down
the
steep
steps
came
thumping
and
splashing
in
the
flood
deluging
muck
the
sentry
body
then
his
rifle
handles
of
old
boche
bombs
and
mud
in
ruck
on
ruck
we
dredged
him
up
for
killed
until
he
whined
o
sir
my
eyes
i
blind
i
blind
i
blind
coaxing
i
held
a
flame
against
his
lids
and
said
if
he
could
see
the
least
blurred
light
he
was
not
blind
in
time
he
get
all
right
i
ca
he
sobbed
eyeballs
like
squids
watch
my
dreams
still
but
i
forgot
him
there
in
posting
next
for
duty
and
sending
a
scout
to
beg
a
stretcher
somewhere
and
floundering
about
to
other
posts
under
the
shrieking
air
those
other
wretches
how
they
bled
and
spewed
and
one
who
would
have
drowned
himself
for
good
i
try
not
to
remember
these
things
now
let
dread
hark
back
for
one
word
only
how
to
that
sentry
moans
and
jumps
and
the
wild
chattering
of
his
broken
teeth
renewed
most
horribly
whenever
crumps
pummelled
the
roof
and
slogged
the
air
beneath
through
the
dense
din
i
say
we
heard
him
shout
i
see
your
lights
but
ours
had
long
died
out
the
he
dropped
more
sullenly
than
wearily
lay
stupid
like
a
cod
heavy
like
meat
and
none
of
us
could
kick
him
to
his
feet
just
blinked
at
my
revolver
blearily
did
appear
to
know
a
war
was
on
or
see
the
blasted
trench
at
which
he
stared
i
do
in
he
whined
if
this
hand
spared
i
murder
them
i
will
a
low
voice
said
it
blighty
he
sees
his
pluck
all
gone
dreaming
of
all
the
valiant
that
are
dead
bold
uncles
smiling
ministerially
maybe
his
brave
young
wife
getting
her
fun
in
some
new
home
improved
materially
it
not
these
stiffs
have
crazed
him
nor
the
hun
we
sent
him
down
at
last
out
of
the
way
unwounded
stout
lad
too
before
that
strafe
malingering
winked
not
half
next
day
i
heard
the
doc
laugh
that
scum
you
sent
last
night
soon
died
hooray
exposure
i
our
brains
ache
in
the
merciless
iced
east
winds
that
knife
us
wearied
we
keep
awake
because
the
night
is
silent
low
drooping
flares
confuse
our
memory
of
the
salient
worried
by
silence
sentries
whisper
curious
nervous
but
nothing
happens
watching
we
hear
the
mad
gusts
tugging
on
the
wire
like
twitching
agonies
of
men
among
its
brambles
northward
incessantly
the
flickering
gunnery
rumbles
far
off
like
a
dull
rumour
of
some
other
war
what
are
we
doing
here
the
poignant
misery
of
dawn
begins
to
grow
we
only
know
war
lasts
rain
soaks
and
clouds
sag
stormy
dawn
massing
in
the
east
her
melancholy
army
attacks
once
more
in
ranks
on
shivering
ranks
of
gray
but
nothing
happens
sudden
successive
flights
of
bullets
streak
the
silence
less
deadly
than
the
air
that
shudders
black
with
snow
with
sidelong
flowing
flakes
that
flock
pause
and
renew
we
watch
them
wandering
up
and
down
the
wind
nonchalance
but
nothing
happens
ii
pale
flakes
with
lingering
stealth
come
feeling
for
our
faces
we
cringe
in
holes
back
on
forgotten
dreams
and
stare
deep
into
grassier
ditches
so
we
drowse
littered
with
blossoms
trickling
where
the
blackbird
fusses
is
it
that
we
are
dying
slowly
our
ghosts
drag
home
glimpsing
the
sunk
fires
glozed
with
crusted
jewels
crickets
jingle
there
for
hours
the
innocent
mice
rejoice
the
house
is
theirs
shutters
and
doors
all
closed
on
us
the
doors
are
closed
we
turn
back
to
our
dying
since
we
believe
not
otherwise
can
kind
fires
burn
nor
ever
suns
smile
true
on
child
or
field
or
fruit
for
god
invincible
spring
our
love
is
made
afraid
therefore
not
loath
we
lie
out
here
therefore
were
born
for
love
of
god
seems
dying
his
frost
will
fasten
on
this
mud
and
us
shrivelling
many
hands
and
puckering
foreheads
crisp
the
picks
and
shovels
in
their
shaking
grasp
pause
over
faces
all
their
eyes
are
ice
but
nothing
happens
spring
offensive
halted
against
the
shade
of
a
last
hill
they
fed
and
lying
easy
were
at
ease
and
finding
comfortable
chests
and
knees
carelessly
slept
but
many
there
stood
still
to
face
the
stark
blank
sky
beyond
the
ridge
knowing
their
feet
had
come
to
the
end
of
the
world
marvelling
they
stood
and
watched
the
long
grass
swirled
by
the
may
breeze
murmurous
with
wasp
and
midge
for
though
the
summer
oozed
into
their
veins
like
the
injected
drug
for
their
bones
pains
sharp
on
their
souls
hung
the
imminent
line
of
grass
fearfully
flashed
the
sky
mysterious
glass
hour
after
hour
they
ponder
the
warm
field
and
the
far
valley
behind
where
the
buttercups
had
blessed
with
gold
their
slow
boots
coming
up
where
even
the
little
brambles
would
not
yield
but
clutched
and
clung
to
them
like
sorrowing
hands
they
breathe
like
trees
unstirred
till
like
a
cold
gust
thrilled
the
little
word
at
which
each
body
and
its
soul
begird
and
tighten
them
for
battle
no
alarms
of
bugles
no
high
flags
no
clamorous
haste
only
a
lift
and
flare
of
eyes
that
faced
the
sun
like
a
friend
with
whom
their
love
is
done
o
larger
shone
that
smile
against
the
sun
mightier
than
his
whose
bounty
these
have
spurned
so
soon
they
topped
the
hill
and
raced
together
over
an
open
stretch
of
herb
and
heather
exposed
and
instantly
the
whole
sky
burned
with
fury
against
them
and
soft
sudden
cups
opened
in
thousands
for
their
blood
and
the
green
slopes
chasmed
and
steepened
sheer
to
infinite
space
of
them
who
running
on
that
last
high
place
leapt
to
swift
unseen
bullets
or
went
up
on
the
hot
blast
and
fury
of
hell
upsurge
or
plunged
and
fell
away
past
this
world
verge
some
say
god
caught
them
even
before
they
fell
but
what
say
such
as
from
existence
brink
ventured
but
drave
too
swift
to
sink
the
few
who
rushed
in
the
body
to
enter
hell
and
there
all
its
fiends
and
flames
with
superhuman
inhumanities
glories
immemorial
shames
and
crawling
slowly
back
have
by
degrees
regained
cool
peaceful
air
in
wonder
why
speak
they
not
of
comrades
that
went
under
the
chances
i
mind
as
the
night
afore
that
show
us
five
got
talking
we
was
in
the
know
over
the
top
boys
we
for
it
first
wave
we
are
first
ruddy
wave
that
tore
it
ah
well
says
jimmy
an
seen
some
scrappin
there
ai
more
nor
five
things
as
can
ye
get
knocked
out
else
wounded
bad
or
cushy
scuppered
or
nowt
except
yer
feeling
mushy
one
of
us
got
the
blown
to
chops
was
hurt
like
losin
both
props
an
one
to
use
the
word
of
the
misfortoon
to
be
took
by
fritz
now
me
i
was
scratched
praise
god
almighty
though
next
time
please
i
thank
for
a
blighty
but
poor
young
jim
livin
an
not
reckoned
five
chances
an
wounded
killed
and
all
the
lot
the
ruddy
lot
all
rolled
in
one
jim
mad
i
will
to
the
king
and
offer
him
consolation
in
his
trouble
for
that
man
there
has
set
his
teeth
to
die
and
being
one
that
hates
obedience
discipline
and
orderliness
of
life
i
can
not
mourn
him
yeats
patting
goodbye
doubtless
they
told
the
lad
he
always
show
the
hun
a
brave
man
face
father
would
sooner
him
dead
than
in
disgrace
was
proud
to
see
him
going
aye
and
glad
perhaps
his
mother
whimpered
how
she
fret
until
he
got
a
nice
safe
wound
to
nurse
sisters
would
wish
girls
too
could
shoot
charge
curse
brothers
would
send
his
favourite
cigarette
each
week
month
after
month
they
wrote
the
same
thinking
him
sheltered
in
some
hut
where
once
an
hour
a
bullet
missed
its
aim
and
misses
teased
the
hunger
of
his
brain
his
eyes
grew
old
with
wincing
and
his
hand
reckless
with
ague
courage
leaked
as
sand
from
the
best
sandbags
after
years
of
rain
but
never
leave
wound
fever
shock
untrapped
the
wretch
and
death
seemed
still
withheld
for
torture
of
lying
machinally
shelled
at
the
pleasure
of
this
world
powers
who
run
amok
he
seen
men
shoot
their
hands
on
night
patrol
their
people
never
knew
yet
they
were
vile
death
sooner
than
dishonour
that
the
style
so
father
said
one
dawn
our
wire
patrol
carried
him
this
time
death
had
not
missed
we
could
do
nothing
but
wipe
his
bleeding
cough
could
it
be
accident
rifles
go
off
not
sniped
no
later
they
found
the
english
ball
it
was
the
reasoned
crisis
of
his
soul
against
the
fires
that
would
not
burn
him
whole
but
kept
him
for
death
perjury
and
scoff
and
life
and
both
their
riling
with
him
they
buried
the
muzzle
his
teeth
had
kissed
and
truthfully
wrote
the
mother
tim
died
smiling
futility
move
him
into
the
sun
gently
its
touch
awoke
him
once
at
home
whispering
of
fields
unsown
always
it
woke
him
even
in
france
until
this
morning
and
this
snow
if
anything
might
rouse
him
now
the
kind
old
sun
will
know
think
how
it
wakes
the
seeds
woke
once
the
clays
of
a
cold
star
are
limbs
so
are
sides
still
warm
too
hard
to
stir
was
it
for
this
the
clay
grew
tall
o
what
made
fatuous
sunbeams
toil
to
break
earth
sleep
at
all
smile
smile
smile
head
to
limp
head
the

scanned
yesterday

the

typed
small

large
vast

from
our
latest
haul
also
they
read
of
cheap

said
the
paper
when
this
war
is
done
the
men
first
instinct
will
be
making
homes
meanwhile
their
foremost
need
is
aerodromes
it
being
certain
war
has
just
begun
peace
would
do
wrong
to
our
undying
dead
the
sons
we
offered
might
regret
they
died
if
we
got
nothing
lasting
in
their
stead
we
must
be
solidly
indemnified
though
all
be
worthy
victory
which
all
bought
we
rulers
sitting
in
this
ancient
spot
would
wrong
our
very
selves
if
we
forgot
the
greatest
glory
will
be
theirs
who
fought
who
kept
this
nation
in
integrity
nation
the
readers
did
not
chafe
but
smiled
at
one
another
curiously
like
secret
men
who
know
their
secret
safe
this
is
the
thing
they
know
and
never
speak
that
england
one
by
one
had
fled
to
france
not
many
elsewhere
now
save
under
france
pictures
of
these
broad
smiles
appear
each
week
and
people
in
whose
voice
real
feeling
rings
say
how
they
smile
they
happy
now
poor
things
september
conscious
his
fingers
wake
and
flutter
up
the

his

come
open
with
a
pull
of
will
helped
by
the
yellow
by
his
head
a
drawls
across
the
how
smooth
the
floor
of
the
ward
is
what
a
rug
and
who
that
talking
somewhere
out
of

why
are
they
laughing
what
inside
that
jug

doctor
yes
all
right
all
right
but
sudden
dusk
bewilders
all
the

there
seems
no

of

looks
so
far
away
and
everywhere
music

roses
burnt
through
crimson
slaughter
cold
cold

cold

so
hot
and
there
no

how

i
got
god
for
one

to

myself
to
nothing
more
than
air
one
spring
is
one

long
spring
wind
would
work
its

and
grow

legs
as
quick
as
my

lamed
but
listen
how
he
shouts
when
i
lugged
out
he
still
be
good
for
that
here
in
this
you
know
i
thought
how
well
i
might
have
swept
his
floors
for
ever
i
ask
no
night
off
when
the
bustle
over
enjoying
so
the

who
prejudiced
against

when
his

that

rats
lead
nosing
along
at

down
some
safe
vat
they
find
a
home
before
they
rot
dead
men
may
envy
living
mites
in
cheese
or
good
germs
even
microbes
have
their
joys
and

and
never

some

no

if

very
sure
i
shall
be
better
off
with
plants
that
share
more
peaceably
the
meadow
and
the

soft
rains
will
touch
me
as
they

and
nothing

the

poor
comfort
for

soldiers
may
grow
a
soul
when
turned
to
fronds
but
here
the
thing
best
left
at
home
with
friends
my
soul
a
little
grief
grappling
your
chest
to
climb
your
throat
on
sobs
easily
chased
on
other
sighs
and
wiped
by
fresher
winds
carry
my
crying
spirit
till
it
weaned
to
do
without
what
blood
remained
these
wounds
wild
with
all
regrets
another
version
of
a

my

we
said
we
hate
to
grow
dead
old
but
now
not
to

seems
awful
not
to
renew
my

with
my
boys
and
teach
hitting
shooting
and
hunting
all
the
arts
of
hurting
well
that
what
i

and
making

your

five

oh
could
i
do
that
here
in
this
coffin
of
a

i
like
to
kneel
and
sweep
his

for

and
ask
no

shall
stay
in
you
friend
for
some
few
hours
you
feel
my
heavy
spirit
chill
your
chest
and
climb
your
throat
on
sobs
until
it
chased
on
sighs
and
wiped
from
off
your

by

on

from

december
disabled
he
sat
in
a
wheeled
chair
waiting
for
dark
and
shivered
in
his
ghastly
suit
of
grey
legless
sewn
short
at
elbow
through
the
park
voices
of
boys
rang
saddening
like
a
hymn
voices
of
play
and
pleasure
after
day
till
gathering
sleep
had
mothered
them
from
him
about
this
time
town
used
to
swing
so
gay
when
budded
in
the
trees
and
girls
glanced
lovelier
as
the
air
grew
dim
in
the
old
times
before
he
threw
away
his
knees
now
he
will
never
feel
again
how
slim
girls
waists
are
or
how
warm
their
subtle
hands
all
of
them
touch
him
like
some
queer
disease
there
was
an
artist
silly
for
his
face
for
it
was
younger
than
his
youth
last
year
now
he
is
old
his
back
will
never
brace
he
lost
his
colour
very
far
from
here
poured
it
down
till
the
veins
ran
dry
and
half
his
lifetime
lapsed
in
the
hot
race
and
leap
of
purple
spurted
from
his
thigh
one
time
he
liked
a
bloodsmear
down
his
leg
after
the
matches
carried
it
was
after
football
when
he
drunk
a
peg
he
thought
he
better
join
he
wonders
why
someone
had
said
he
look
a
god
in
kilts
that
why
and
maybe
too
to
please
his
meg
aye
that
was
it
to
please
the
giddy
jilts
he
asked
to
join
he
did
have
to
beg
smiling
they
wrote
his
lie
aged
nineteen
years
germans
he
scarcely
thought
of
and
no
fears
of
fear
came
yet
he
thought
of
jewelled
hilts
for
daggers
in
plaid
socks
of
smart
salutes
and
care
of
arms
and
leave
and
pay
arrears
esprit
de
corps
and
hints
for
young
recruits
and
soon
he
was
drafted
out
with
drums
and
cheers
some
cheered
him
home
but
not
as
crowds
cheer
goal
only
a
solemn
man
who
brought
him
fruits
thanked
him
and
then
inquired
about
his
soul
now
he
will
spend
a
few
sick
years
in
institutes
and
do
what
things
the
rules
consider
wise
and
take
whatever
pity
they
may
dole
he
noticed
how
the
women
eyes
passed
from
him
to
the
strong
men
that
were
whole
how
cold
and
late
it
is
why
do
they
come
and
put
him
into
bed
why
do
they
come

the

of

general
notes
due
to
the
general
circumstances
surrounding
wilfred
owen
and
his
death
one
week
before
the
war
ended
it
should
be
noted
that
these
poems
are
not
all
in
their
final
form
owen
had
only
had
a
few
of
his
poems
published
during
his
lifetime
and
his
papers
were
in
a
state
of
disarray
when
siegfried
sassoon
his
friend
and
fellow
poet
put
together
this
volume
the
edition
was
the
first
edition
of
poems
the
reprint
of
which
this
is
a
transcript
added
one
more
and
nothing
else
happened
until
edmund
blunden
edition
even
with
that
edition
there
remained
gaps
and
several
more
editions
added
more
and
more
poems
and
fragments
in
various
forms
as
it
was
difficult
to
tell
which
of
owen
drafts
were
his
final
ones
until
jon
stallworthy
complete
poems
and
fragments
included
all
that
could
be
found
and
tried
to
put
them
in
chronological
order
with
the
latest
revisions
etc
therefore
it
should
not
be
surprising
if
some
or
most
of
these
poems
differ
from
later
editions
after
owen
death
his
writings
gradually
gained
so
that
although
virtually
unknown
during
the
war
he
came
into
high
regard
benjamin

british
composer

set
nine
of
owen
works
as
the
text

his
war

after
the
second
world
war
called
owen
by
far
our
greatest
war
poet
and
one
of
the
most
original
poets
of
this
century
owen
is
especially
noted
for
his
use
of
pararhyme
five
of
those
nine
texts
are
some
form
of

here
