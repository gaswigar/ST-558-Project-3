s
preface
if
the
volume
now
presented
to
the
public
were
a
mere
work
of
art
the
history
of
its
misfortune
might
be
written
in
two
very
simple
words
too
late
the
nature
and
character
of
slavery
have
been
subjects
of
an
almost
endless
variety
of
artistic
representation
and
after
the
brilliant
achievements
in
that
field
and
while
those
achievements
are
yet
fresh
in
the
memory
of
the
million
he
who
would
add
another
to
the
legion
must
possess
the
charm
of
transcendent
excellence
or
apologize
for
something
worse
than
rashness
the
reader
is
therefore
assured
with
all
due
promptitude
that
his
attention
is
not
invited
to
a
work
of
art
but
to
a
work
of
facts
facts
terrible
and
almost
incredible
it
may
be
yet
facts
nevertheless
i
am
authorized
to
say
that
there
is
not
a
fictitious
name
nor
place
in
the
whole
volume
but
that
names
and
places
are
literally
given
and
that
every
transaction
therein
described
actually
transpired
perhaps
the
best
preface
to
this
volume
is
furnished
in
the
following
letter
of
douglass
written
in
answer
to
my
urgent
solicitation
for
such
a
work
rochester
y
dear
friend
i
have
long
entertained
as
you
very
well
know
a
somewhat
positive
repugnance
to
writing
or
speaking
anything
for
the
public
which
could
with
any
degree
of
plausibilty
make
me
liable
to
the
imputation
of
seeking
personal
notoriety
for
its
own
sake
entertaining
that
feeling
very
sincerely
and
permitting
its
control
perhaps
quite
unreasonably
i
have
often
refused
to
narrate
my
personal
experience
in
public
meetings
and
in
sympathizing
circles
when
urged
to
do
so
by
friends
with
whose
views
and
wishes
ordinarily
it
were
a
pleasure
to
comply
in
my
letters
and
speeches
i
have
generally
aimed
to
discuss
the
question
of
slavery
in
the
light
of
fundamental
principles
and
upon
facts
notorious
and
open
to
all
making
i
trust
no
more
of
the
fact
of
my
own
former
enslavement
than
circumstances
seemed
absolutely
to
require
i
have
never
placed
my
opposition
to
slavery
on
a
basis
so
narrow
as
my
own
enslavement
but
rather
upon
the
indestructible
and
unchangeable
laws
of
human
nature
every
one
of
which
is
perpetually
and
flagrantly
violated
by
the
slave
system
i
have
also
felt
that
it
was
best
for
those
having
histories
worth
the
writing
or
supposed
to
be
so
to
commit
such
work
to
hands
other
than
their
own
to
write
of
one
s
self
in
such
a
manner
as
not
to
incur
the
imputation
of
weakness
vanity
and
egotism
is
a
work
within
the
ability
of
but
few
and
i
have
little
reason
to
believe
that
i
belong
to
that
fortunate
few
these
considerations
caused
me
to
hesitate
when
first
you
kindly
urged
me
to
prepare
for
publication
a
full
account
of
my
life
as
a
slave
and
my
life
as
a
freeman
nevertheless
i
see
with
you
many
reasons
for
regarding
my
autobiography
as
exceptional
in
its
character
and
as
being
in
some
sense
naturally
beyond
the
reach
of
those
reproaches
which
honorable
and
sensitive
minds
dislike
to
incur
it
is
not
to
illustrate
any
heroic
achievements
of
a
man
but
to
vindicate
a
just
and
beneficent
principle
in
its
application
to
the
whole
human
family
by
letting
in
the
light
of
truth
upon
a
system
esteemed
by
some
as
a
blessing
and
by
others
as
a
curse
and
a
crime
i
agree
with
you
that
this
system
is
now
at
the
bar
of
public
opinion
not
only
of
this
country
but
of
the
whole
civilized
world
for
judgment
its
friends
have
made
for
it
the
usual
plea
not
guilty
the
case
must
therefore
proceed
any
facts
either
from
slaves
slaveholders
or
calculated
to
enlighten
the
public
mind
by
revealing
the
true
nature
character
and
tendency
of
the
slave
system
are
in
order
and
can
scarcely
be
innocently
withheld
i
see
too
that
there
are
special
reasons
why
i
should
write
my
own
biography
in
preference
to
employing
another
to
do
it
not
only
is
slavery
on
trial
but
unfortunately
the
enslaved
people
are
also
on
trial
it
is
alleged
that
they
are
naturally
inferior
that
they
are
in
the
scale
of
humanity
and
so
utterly
stupid
that
they
are
unconscious
of
their
wrongs
and
do
not
apprehend
their
rights
looking
then
at
your
request
from
this
and
wishing
everything
of
which
you
think
me
capable
to
go
to
the
benefit
of
my
afflicted
people
i
part
with
my
doubts
and
hesitation
and
proceed
to
furnish
you
the
desired
manuscript
hoping
that
you
may
be
able
to
make
such
arrangements
for
its
publication
as
shall
be
best
adapted
to
accomplish
that
good
which
you
so
enthusiastically
anticipate
frederick
douglass
there
was
little
necessity
for
doubt
and
hesitation
on
the
part
of
douglass
as
to
the
propriety
of
his
giving
to
the
world
a
full
account
of
himself
a
man
who
was
born
and
brought
up
in
slavery
a
living
witness
of
its
horrors
who
often
himself
experienced
its
cruelties
and
who
despite
the
depressing
influences
surrounding
his
birth
youth
and
manhood
has
risen
from
a
dark
and
almost
absolute
obscurity
to
the
distinguished
position
which
he
now
occupies
might
very
well
assume
the
existence
of
a
commendable
curiosity
on
the
part
of
the
public
to
know
the
facts
of
his
remarkable
history
editor
introduction
when
a
man
raises
himself
from
the
lowest
condition
in
society
to
the
highest
mankind
pay
him
the
tribute
of
their
admiration
when
he
accomplishes
this
elevation
by
native
energy
guided
by
prudence
and
wisdom
their
admiration
is
increased
but
when
his
course
onward
and
upward
excellent
in
itself
furthermore
proves
a
possible
what
had
hitherto
been
regarded
as
an
impossible
reform
then
he
becomes
a
burning
and
a
shining
light
on
which
the
aged
may
look
with
gladness
the
young
with
hope
and
the
as
a
representative
of
what
they
may
themselves
become
to
such
a
man
dear
reader
it
is
my
privilege
to
introduce
you
the
life
of
frederick
douglass
recorded
in
the
pages
which
follow
is
not
merely
an
example
of
under
the
most
adverse
circumstances
it
is
moreover
a
noble
vindication
of
the
highest
aims
of
the
american
movement
the
real
object
of
that
movement
is
not
only
to
disenthrall
it
is
also
to
bestow
upon
the
negro
the
exercise
of
all
those
rights
from
the
possession
of
which
he
has
been
so
long
debarred
but
this
full
recognition
of
the
colored
man
to
the
right
and
the
entire
admission
of
the
same
to
the
full
privileges
political
religious
and
social
of
manhood
requires
powerful
effort
on
the
part
of
the
enthralled
as
well
as
on
the
part
of
those
who
would
disenthrall
them
the
people
at
large
must
feel
the
conviction
as
well
as
admit
the
abstract
logic
of
human
equality
the
negro
for
the
first
time
in
the
world
s
history
brought
in
full
contact
with
high
civilization
must
prove
his
title
first
to
all
that
is
demanded
for
him
in
the
teeth
of
unequal
chances
he
must
prove
himself
equal
to
the
mass
of
those
who
oppress
him
therefore
absolutely
superior
to
his
apparent
fate
and
to
their
relative
ability
and
it
is
most
cheering
to
the
friends
of
freedom
today
that
evidence
of
this
equality
is
rapidly
accumulating
not
from
the
ranks
of
the
colored
people
of
the
free
states
but
from
the
very
depths
of
slavery
itself
the
indestructible
equality
of
man
to
man
is
demonstrated
by
the
ease
with
which
black
men
scarce
one
remove
from
barbarism
if
slavery
can
be
honored
with
such
a
distinction
vault
into
the
high
places
of
the
most
advanced
and
painfully
acquired
civilization
ward
and
garnett
wells
brown
and
pennington
loguen
and
douglass
are
banners
on
the
outer
wall
under
which
abolition
is
fighting
its
most
successful
battles
because
they
are
living
exemplars
of
the
practicability
of
the
most
radical
abolitionism
for
they
were
all
of
them
born
to
the
doom
of
slavery
some
of
them
remained
slaves
until
adult
age
yet
they
all
have
not
only
won
equality
to
their
white
fellow
citizens
in
civil
religious
political
and
social
rank
but
they
have
also
illustrated
and
adorned
our
common
country
by
their
genius
learning
and
eloquence
the
characteristics
whereby
douglass
has
won
first
rank
among
these
remarkable
men
and
is
still
rising
toward
highest
rank
among
living
americans
are
abundantly
laid
bare
in
the
book
before
us
like
the
autobiography
of
hugh
miller
it
carries
us
so
far
back
into
early
childhood
as
to
throw
light
upon
the
question
when
positive
and
persistent
memory
begins
in
the
human
and
like
hugh
miller
he
must
have
been
a
shy
child
occasionally
oppressed
by
what
he
could
not
well
account
for
peering
and
poking
about
among
the
layers
of
right
and
wrong
of
tyrant
and
thrall
and
the
wonderfulness
of
that
hopeless
tide
of
things
which
brought
power
to
one
race
and
unrequited
toil
to
another
until
finally
he
stumbled
upon
his
ammonite
hidden
away
down
in
the
depths
of
his
own
nature
and
which
revealed
to
him
the
fact
that
liberty
and
right
for
all
men
were
anterior
to
slavery
and
wrong
when
his
knowledge
of
the
world
was
bounded
by
the
visible
horizon
on
lloyd
s
plantation
and
while
every
thing
around
him
bore
a
fixed
iron
stamp
as
if
it
had
always
been
so
this
was
for
one
so
young
a
notable
discovery
to
his
uncommon
memory
then
we
must
add
a
keen
and
accurate
insight
into
men
and
things
an
original
breadth
of
common
sense
which
enabled
him
to
see
and
weigh
and
compare
whatever
passed
before
him
and
which
kindled
a
desire
to
search
out
and
define
their
relations
to
other
things
not
so
patent
but
which
never
succumbed
to
the
marvelous
nor
the
supernatural
a
sacred
thirst
for
liberty
and
for
learning
first
as
a
means
of
attaining
liberty
then
as
an
end
in
itself
most
desirable
a
will
an
unfaltering
energy
and
determination
to
obtain
what
his
soul
pronounced
desirable
a
majestic
determined
courage
a
deep
and
agonizing
sympathy
with
his
embruted
crushed
and
bleeding
fellow
slaves
and
an
extraordinary
depth
of
passion
together
with
that
rare
alliance
between
passion
and
intellect
which
enables
the
former
when
deeply
roused
to
excite
develop
and
sustain
the
latter
with
these
original
gifts
in
view
let
us
look
at
his
schooling
the
fearful
discipline
through
which
it
pleased
god
to
prepare
him
for
the
high
calling
on
which
he
has
since
entered
the
advocacy
of
emancipation
by
the
people
who
are
not
slaves
and
for
this
special
mission
his
plantation
education
was
better
than
any
he
could
have
acquired
in
any
lettered
school
what
he
needed
was
facts
and
experiences
welded
to
acutely
wrought
up
sympathies
and
these
he
could
not
elsewhere
have
obtained
in
a
manner
so
peculiarly
adapted
to
his
nature
his
physical
being
was
well
trained
also
running
wild
until
advanced
into
boyhood
hard
work
and
light
diet
thereafter
and
a
skill
in
handicraft
in
youth
for
his
special
mission
then
this
was
considered
in
connection
with
his
natural
gifts
a
good
schooling
and
for
his
special
mission
he
doubtless
left
school
just
at
the
proper
moment
had
he
remained
longer
in
slavery
had
he
fretted
under
bonds
until
the
ripening
of
manhood
and
its
passions
until
the
drear
agony
of
and
had
been
piled
upon
his
already
bitter
experiences
then
not
only
would
his
own
history
have
had
another
termination
but
the
drama
of
american
slavery
would
have
been
essentially
varied
for
i
can
not
resist
the
belief
that
the
boy
who
learned
to
read
and
write
as
he
did
who
taught
his
fellow
slaves
these
precious
acquirements
as
he
did
who
plotted
for
their
mutual
escape
as
he
did
would
when
a
man
at
bay
strike
a
blow
which
would
make
slavery
reel
and
stagger
furthermore
blows
and
insults
he
bore
at
the
moment
without
resentment
deep
but
suppressed
emotion
rendered
him
insensible
to
their
sting
but
it
was
afterward
when
the
memory
of
them
went
seething
through
his
brain
breeding
a
fiery
indignation
at
his
injured
that
the
resolve
came
to
resist
and
the
time
fixed
when
to
resist
and
the
plot
laid
how
to
resist
and
he
always
kept
his
word
in
what
he
undertook
in
this
line
he
looked
fate
in
the
face
and
had
a
cool
keen
look
at
the
relation
of
means
to
ends
henry
bibb
to
avoid
chastisement
strewed
his
master
s
bed
with
charmed
leaves
and
frederick
douglass
quietly
pocketed
a
like
compared
his
muscles
with
those
of
covey
and
in
the
history
of
his
life
in
bondage
we
find
well
developed
that
inherent
and
continuous
energy
of
character
which
will
ever
render
him
distinguished
what
his
hand
found
to
do
he
did
with
his
might
even
while
conscious
that
he
was
wronged
out
of
his
daily
earnings
he
worked
and
worked
hard
at
his
daily
labor
he
went
with
a
will
with
keen
well
set
eye
brawny
chest
lithe
figure
and
fair
sweep
of
arm
he
would
have
been
king
among
calkers
had
that
been
his
mission
it
must
not
be
overlooked
in
this
glance
at
his
education
that
douglass
lacked
one
aid
to
which
so
many
men
of
mark
have
been
deeply
indebted
he
had
neither
a
mother
s
care
nor
a
mother
s
culture
save
that
which
slavery
grudgingly
meted
out
to
him
bitter
nurse
may
not
even
her
features
relax
with
human
feeling
when
she
gazes
at
such
offspring
how
susceptible
he
was
to
the
kindly
influences
of
may
be
gathered
from
his
own
words
on
page
it
has
been
a
standing
grief
to
me
that
i
know
so
little
of
my
mother
and
that
i
was
so
early
separated
from
her
the
counsels
of
her
love
must
have
been
beneficial
to
me
the
side
view
of
her
face
is
imaged
on
my
memory
and
i
take
few
steps
in
life
without
feeling
her
presence
but
the
image
is
mute
and
i
have
no
striking
words
of
hers
treasured
from
the
depths
of
chattel
slavery
in
maryland
our
author
escaped
into
the
of
the
north
in
new
bedford
massachusetts
here
he
found

very
handicraft

the

him

found
himself

of
a
class

position

words

us
its

its
features

in
running
thither
for

and

we
have
only
fled
from
the
hungry
to
the
devouring
wolf
from
a
corrupt
and
selfish
world
to
a
hollow
and
hypocritical
before
american
and
foreign
society
four
years
or
more
from
to
he
struggled
on
in
new
bedford
sawing
wood
rolling
casks
or
doing
what
labor
he
might
to
support
himself
and
young
family
four
years
he
brooded
over
the
scars
which
slavery
and
had
inflicted
upon
his
body
and
soul
and
then
with
his
wounds
yet
unhealed
he
fell
among
the
garrisonians
a
glorious
waif
to
those
most
ardent
reformers
it
happened
one
day
at
nantucket
that
he
diffidently
and
reluctantly
was
led
to
address
an
meeting
he
was
about
the
age
when
the
younger
pitt
entered
the
house
of
commons
like
pitt
too
he
stood
up
a
born
orator
william
lloyd
garrison
who
was
happily
present
writes
thus
of
douglass
maiden
effort
i
shall
never
forget
his
first
speech
at
the
convention
the
extraordinary
emotion
it
excited
in
my
own
mind
the
powerful
impression
it
created
upon
a
crowded
auditory
completely
taken
by
surprise
i
think
i
never
hated
slavery
so
intensely
as
at
that
moment
certainly
my
perception
of
the
enormous
outrage
which
is
inflicted
by
it
on
the
godlike
nature
of
its
victims
was
rendered
far
more
clear
than
ever
there
stood
one
in
physical
proportions
and
stature
commanding
and
exact
in
intellect
richly
endowed
in
natural
eloquence
a
it
is
of
interest
to
compare
douglass
s
account
of
this
meeting
with
garrison
s
of
the
two
i
think
the
latter
the
most
correct
it
must
have
been
a
grand
burst
of
eloquence
the
pent
up
agony
indignation
and
pathos
of
an
abused
and
harrowed
boyhood
and
youth
bursting
out
in
all
their
freshness
and
overwhelming
earnestness
this
unique
introduction
to
its
great
leader
led
immediately
to
the
employment
of
douglass
as
an
agent
by
the
american
society
so
far
as
his
and
independent
character
would
permit
he
became
after
the
strictest
sect
a
garrisonian
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
he
formed
a
complement
which
they
needed
and
they
were
a
complement
equally
necessary
to
his
with
his
deep
and
keen
sensitiveness
to
wrong
and
his
wonderful
memory
he
came
from
the
land
of
bondage
full
of
its
woes
and
its
evils
and
painting
them
in
characters
of
living
light
and
on
his
part
he
found
told
out
in
sound
saxon
phrase
all
those
principles
of
justice
and
right
and
liberty
which
had
dimly
brooded
over
the
dreams
of
his
youth
seeking
definite
forms
and
verbal
expression
it
must
have
been
an
electric
flashing
of
thought
and
a
knitting
of
soul
granted
to
but
few
in
this
life
and
will
be
a
memory
to
those
who
participated
in
it
in
the
society
moreover
of
wendell
phillips
edmund
quincy
william
lloyd
garrison
and
other
men
of
earnest
faith
and
refined
culture
douglass
enjoyed
the
high
advantage
of
their
assistance
and
counsel
in
the
labor
of
to
which
he
now
addressed
himself
with
wonted
energy
yet
these
gentlemen
although
proud
of
frederick
douglass
failed
to
fathom
and
bring
out
to
the
light
of
day
the
highest
qualities
of
his
mind
the
force
of
their
own
education
stood
in
their
own
way
they
did
not
delve
into
the
mind
of
a
colored
man
for
capacities
which
the
pride
of
race
led
them
to
believe
to
be
restricted
to
their
own
saxon
blood
bitter
and
vindictive
sarcasm
irresistible
mimicry
and
a
pathetic
narrative
of
his
own
experiences
of
slavery
were
the
intellectual
manifestations
which
they
encouraged
him
to
exhibit
on
the
platform
or
in
the
lecture
desk
a
visit
to
england
in
threw
douglass
among
men
and
women
of
earnest
souls
and
high
culture
and
who
moreover
had
never
drank
of
the
bitter
waters
of
american
caste
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
breathed
an
atmosphere
congenial
to
the
longings
of
his
spirit
and
felt
his
manhood
free
and
unrestricted
the
cordial
and
manly
greetings
of
the
british
and
irish
audiences
in
public
and
the
refinement
and
elegance
of
the
social
circles
in
which
he
mingled
not
only
as
an
equal
but
as
a
recognized
man
of
genius
were
doubtless
genial
and
pleasant
resting
places
in
his
hitherto
thorny
and
troubled
journey
through
life
there
are
joys
on
the
earth
and
to
the
wayfaring
fugitive
from
american
slavery
or
american
caste
this
is
one
of
them
but
his
sojourn
in
england
was
more
than
a
joy
to
douglass
like
the
platform
at
nantucket
it
awakened
him
to
the
consciousness
of
new
powers
that
lay
in
him
from
the
pupilage
of
garrisonism
he
rose
to
the
dignity
of
a
teacher
and
a
thinker
his
opinions
on
the
broader
aspects
of
the
great
american
question
were
earnestly
and
incessantly
sought
from
various
points
of
view
and
he
must
perforce
bestir
himself
to
give
suitable
answer
with
that
prompt
and
truthful
perception
which
has
led
their
sisters
in
all
ages
of
the
world
to
gather
at
the
feet
and
support
the
hands
of
reformers
the
gentlewomen
of
england
were
foremost
to
encourage
and
strengthen
him
to
carve
out
for
himself
a
path
fitted
to
his
powers
and
energies
in
the
against
slavery
and
caste
to
which
he
was
pledged
and
one
stirring
thought
inseparable
from
the
british
idea
of
the
evangel
of
freedom
must
have
smote
his
ear
from
every
side
bondmen
know
ye
not
who
would
be
free
themselves
mast
strike
the
blow
the
result
of
this
visit
was
that
on
his
return
to
the
united
states
he
established
a
newspaper
this
proceeding
was
sorely
against
the
wishes
and
the
advice
of
the
leaders
of
the
american
society
but
our
author
had
fully
grown
up
to
the
conviction
of
a
truth
which
they
had
once
promulged
but
now
forgotten
to
wit
that
in
their
own
elevation
colored
men
have
a
blow
to
strike
on
their
own
hook
against
slavery
and
caste
differing
from
his
boston
friends
in
this
matter
diffident
in
his
own
abilities
reluctant
at
their
dissuadings
how
beautiful
is
the
loyalty
with
which
he
still
clung
to
their
principles
in
all
things
else
and
even
in
this
now
came
the
trial
hour
without
cordial
support
from
any
large
body
of
men
or
party
on
this
side
the
atlantic
and
too
far
distant
in
space
and
immediate
interest
to
expect
much
more
after
the
much
already
done
on
the
other
side
he
stood
up
almost
alone
to
the
arduous
labor
and
heavy
expenditure
of
editor
and
lecturer
the
garrison
party
to
which
he
still
adhered
did
not
want
a
newspaper
there
was
an
odor
of
about
it
the
liberty
party
could
hardly
be
expected
to
give
warm
support
to
a
man
who
smote
their
principles
as
with
a
hammer
and
the
wide
gulf
which
separated
the
free
colored
people
from
the
garrisonians
also
separated
them
from
their
brother
frederick
douglass
the
arduous
nature
of
his
labors
from
the
date
of
the
establishment
of
his
paper
may
be
estimated
by
the
fact
that
papers
in
the
united
states
even
while
organs
of
and
when
supported
by
parties
have
with
a
single
exception
failed
to
pay
expenses
douglass
has
maintained
and
does
maintain
his
paper
without
the
support
of
any
party
and
even
in
the
teeth
of
the
opposition
of
those
from
whom
he
had
reason
to
expect
counsel
and
encouragement
he
has
been
compelled
at
one
and
the
same
time
and
almost
constantly
during
the
past
seven
years
to
contribute
matter
to
its
columns
as
editor
and
to
raise
funds
for
its
support
as
lecturer
it
is
within
bounds
to
say
that
he
has
expended
twelve
thousand
dollars
of
his
own
hard
earned
money
in
publishing
this
paper
a
larger
sum
than
has
been
contributed
by
any
one
individual
for
the
general
advancement
of
the
colored
people
there
had
been
many
other
papers
published
and
edited
by
colored
men
beginning
as
far
back
as
when
the
rev
samuel
cornish
and
john
russworm
a
graduate
of
bowdoin
college
and
afterward
governor
of
cape
palmas
published
the
s
in
new
york
city
probably
not
less
than
one
hundred
newspaper
enterprises
have
been
started
in
the
united
states
by
free
colored
men
born
free
and
some
of
them
of
liberal
education
and
fair
talents
for
this
work
but
one
after
another
they
have
fallen
through
although
in
several
instances
friends
contributed
to
their
support
it
had
almost
been
given
up
as
an
impracticable
thing
to
maintain
a
colored
newspaper
when
douglass
with
fewest
early
advantages
of
all
his
competitors
essayed
and
has
proved
the
thing
perfectly
practicable
and
moreover
of
great
public
benefit
this
paper
in
addition
to
its
power
in
holding
up
the
hands
of
those
to
whom
it
is
especially
devoted
also
affords
irrefutable
evidence
of
the
justice
safety
and
practicability
of
immediate
emancipation
it
further
proves
the
immense
loss
which
slavery
inflicts
on
the
land
while
it
dooms
such
energies
as
his
to
the
hereditary
degradation
of
slavery
it
has
been
said
in
this
introduction
that
douglass
had
raised
himself
by
his
own
efforts
to
the
highest
position
in
society
as
a
successful
editor
in
our
land
he
occupies
this
position
our
editors
rule
the
land
and
he
is
one
of
them
as
an
orator
and
thinker
his
position
is
equally
high
in
the
opinion
of
his
countrymen
if
a
stranger
in
the
united
states
would
seek
its
most
distinguished
men
the
movers
of
public
opinion
he
will
find
their
names
mentioned
and
their
movements
chronicled
under
the
head
of
by
magnetic
telegraph
in
the
daily
papers
the
keen
caterers
for
the
public
attention
set
down
in
this
column
such
men
only
as
have
won
high
mark
in
the
public
esteem
during
the
past
winter
very
frequent
mention
of
frederick
douglass
was
made
under
this
head
in
the
daily
papers
his
name
glided
as
often
this
week
from
chicago
next
week
from
boston
over
the
lightning
wires
as
the
name
of
any
other
man
of
whatever
note
to
no
man
did
the
people
more
widely
nor
more
earnestly
say
tell
me
thy
thought
and
somehow
or
other
revolution
seemed
to
follow
in
his
wake
his
were
not
the
mere
words
of
eloquence
which
kossuth
speaks
of
that
delight
the
ear
and
then
pass
away
no
they
were
words
that
brought
forth
fruits
in
the
revolution
in
illinois
and
in
the
passage
of
the
franchise
resolutions
by
the
assembly
of
new
york
and
the
secret
of
his
power
what
is
it
he
is
a
representative
american
man
a
type
of
his
countrymen
naturalists
tell
us
that
a
full
grown
man
is
a
resultant
or
representative
of
all
animated
nature
on
this
globe
beginning
with
the
early
embryo
state
then
representing
the
lowest
forms
of
organic
life
and
passing
through
every
subordinate
grade
or
type
until
he
reaches
the
last
and
highest
manhood
in
like
manner
and
to
the
fullest
extent
has
frederick
douglass
passed
through
every
gradation
of
rank
comprised
in
our
national
and
bears
upon
his
person
and
upon
his
soul
every
thing
that
is
american
and
he
has
not
only
full
sympathy
with
every
thing
american
his
proclivity
or
bent
to
active
toil
and
visible
progress
are
in
the
strictly
national
direction
delighting
to
outstrip
all
nor
have
the
natural
gifts
already
named
as
his
lost
anything
by
his
severe
training
when
unexcited
his
mental
processes
are
probably
slow
but
singularly
clear
in
perception
and
wide
in
vision
the
unfailing
memory
bringing
up
all
the
facts
in
their
every
aspect
incongruities
he
lays
hold
of
incontinently
and
holds
up
on
the
edge
of
his
keen
and
telling
wit
but
this
wit
never
descends
to
frivolity
it
is
rigidly
in
the
keeping
of
his
truthful
common
sense
and
always
used
in
illustration
or
proof
of
some
point
which
could
not
so
readily
be
reached
any
other
way
beware
of
a
yankee
when
he
is
feeding
is
a
shaft
that
strikes
home
in
a
matter
never
so
laid
bare
by
satire
before
the
garrisonian
views
of
disunion
if
carried
to
a
successful
issue
would
only
place
the
people
of
the
north
in
the
same
relation
to
american
slavery
which
they
now
bear
to
the
slavery
of
cuba
or
the
brazils
is
a
statement
in
a
few
words
which
contains
the
result
and
the
evidence
of
an
argument
which
might
cover
pages
but
could
not
carry
stronger
conviction
nor
be
stated
in
less
pregnable
form
in
proof
of
this
i
may
say
that
having
been
submitted
to
the
attention
of
the
garrisonians
in
print
in
march
it
was
repeated
before
them
at
their
business
meeting
in
may
the
platform
on
which
they
invite
free
fight
l
to
all
comers
it
was
given
out
in
the
clear
ringing
tones
wherewith
the
hall
of
shields
was
wont
to
resound
of
old
yet
neither
garrison
nor
phillips
nor
may
nor
remond
nor
foster
nor
burleigh
with
his
subtle
steel
of
the
ice
brook
s
temper
ventured
to
break
a
lance
upon
it
the
doctrine
of
the
dissolution
of
the
union
as
a
means
for
the
abolition
of
american
slavery
was
silenced
upon
the
lips
that
gave
it
birth
and
in
the
presence
of
an
array
of
defenders
who
compose
the
keenest
intellects
in
the
land
the
man
who
is
right
is
a
majority
is
an
aphorism
struck
out
by
douglass
in
that
great
gathering
of
the
friends
of
freedom
at
pittsburgh
in
where
he
towered
among
the
highest
because
with
abilities
inferior
to
none
and
moved
more
deeply
than
any
there
was
neither
policy
nor
party
to
trammel
the
outpourings
of
his
soul
thus
we
find
opposed
to
all
disadvantages
which
a
black
man
in
the
united
states
labors
and
struggles
under
is
this
one
vantage
ground
when
the
chance
comes
and
the
audience
where
he
may
have
a
say
he
stands
forth
the
freest
most
deeply
moved
and
most
earnest
of
all
men
it
has
been
said
of
douglass
that
his
descriptive
and
declamatory
powers
admitted
to
be
of
the
very
highest
order
take
precedence
of
his
logical
force
whilst
the
schools
might
have
trained
him
to
the
exhibition
of
the
formulas
of
deductive
logic
nature
and
circumstances
forced
him
into
the
exercise
of
the
higher
faculties
required
by
induction
the
first
ninety
pages
of
this
life
in
bondage
afford
specimens
of
observing
comparing
and
careful
classifying
of
such
superior
character
that
it
is
difficult
to
believe
them
the
results
of
a
child
s
thinking
he
questions
the
earth
and
the
children
and
the
slaves
around
him
again
and
again
and
finally
looks
to
god
in
the
sky
for
the
why
and
the
wherefore
of
the
unnatural
thing
slavery
yes
if
indeed
thou
art
wherefore
dost
thou
suffer
us
to
be
slain
is
the
only
prayer
and
worship
of
the
dodos
in
the
heart
of
africa
almost
the
same
was
his
prayer
one
of
his
earliest
observations
was
that
white
children
should
know
their
ages
while
the
colored
children
were
ignorant
of
theirs
and
the
songs
of
the
slaves
grated
on
his
inmost
soul
because
a
something
told
him
that
harmony
in
sound
and
music
of
the
spirit
could
not
consociate
with
miserable
degradation
to
such
a
mind
the
ordinary
processes
of
logical
deduction
are
like
proving
that
two
and
two
make
four
mastering
the
intermediate
steps
by
an
intuitive
glance
or
recurring
to
them
as
ferguson
resorted
to
geometry
it
goes
down
to
the
deeper
relation
of
things
and
brings
out
what
may
seem
to
some
mere
statements
but
which
are
new
and
brilliant
generalizations
each
resting
on
a
broad
and
stable
basis
thus
chief
justice
marshall
gave
his
decisions
and
then
told
brother
story
to
look
up
the
authorities
and
they
never
differed
from
him
thus
also
in
his
lecture
on
the
movement
delivered
before
the
rochester
ladies
society
douglass
presents
a
mass
of
thought
which
without
any
showy
display
of
logic
on
his
part
requires
an
exercise
of
the
reasoning
faculties
of
the
reader
to
keep
pace
with
him
and
his
claims
of
the
negro
ethnologically
considered
is
full
of
new
and
fresh
thoughts
on
the
dawning
science
of
if
as
has
been
stated
his
intellection
is
slow
when
unexcited
it
is
most
prompt
and
rapid
when
he
is
thoroughly
aroused
memory
logic
wit
sarcasm
invective
pathos
and
bold
imagery
of
rare
structural
beauty
well
up
as
from
a
copious
fountain
yet
each
in
its
proper
place
and
contributing
to
form
a
whole
grand
in
itself
yet
complete
in
the
minutest
proportions
it
is
most
difficult
to
hedge
him
in
a
corner
for
his
positions
are
taken
so
deliberately
that
it
is
rare
to
find
a
point
in
them
undefended
aforethought
professor
reason
tells
me
the
following
on
a
recent
visit
of
a
public
nature
to
philadelphia
and
in
a
meeting
composed
mostly
of
his
colored
brethren
douglass
proposed
a
comparison
of
views
in
the
matters
of
the
relations
and
duties
of
our
people
he
holding
that
prejudice
was
the
result
of
condition
and
could
be
conquered
by
the
efforts
of
the
degraded
themselves
a
gentleman
present
distinguished
for
logical
acumen
and
subtlety
and
who
had
devoted
no
small
portion
of
the
last
years
to
the
study
and
elucidation
of
this
very
question
held
the
opposite
view
that
prejudice
is
innate
and
unconquerable
he
terminated
a
series
of
well
socratic
questions
to
douglass
with
the
following
if
the
legislature
at
harrisburgh
should
awaken
morning
and
find
each
man
s
skin
turned
black
and
his
hair
woolly
what
could
they
do
to
remove
prejudice
immediately
pass
laws
entitling
black
men
to
all
civil
political
and
social
privileges
was
the
instant
reply
and
the
questioning
the
most
remarkable
mental
phenomenon
in
douglass
is
his
style
in
writing
and
speaking
in
march
he
delivered
an
address
in
the
assembly
chamber
before
the
members
of
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
new
york
an
eye
witness
describes
the
crowded
and
most
intelligent
audience
and
their
rapt
attention
to
the
speaker
as
the
grandest
scene
he
ever
witnessed
in
the
capitol
among
those
whose
eyes
were
riveted
on
the
speaker
full
two
hours
and
a
half
were
thurlow
weed
and
lieutenant
governor
raymond
the
latter
at
the
conclusion
of
the
address
exclaimed
to
a
friend
i
would
give
twenty
thousand
dollars
if
i
could
deliver
that
address
in
that
raymond
is
a
first
class
graduate
of
dartmouth
a
rising
politician
ranking
foremost
in
the
legislature
of
course
his
ideal
of
oratory
must
be
of
the
most
polished
and
finished
description
the
style
of
douglass
in
writing
is
to
me
an
intellectual
puzzle
the
strength
affluence
and
terseness
may
easily
be
accounted
for
because
the
style
of
a
man
is
the
man
but
how
are
we
to
account
for
that
rare
polish
in
his
style
of
writing
which
most
critically
examined
seems
the
result
of
careful
early
culture
among
the
best
classics
of
our
language
it
equals
if
it
does
not
surpass
the
style
of
hugh
miller
which
was
the
wonder
of
the
british
literary
public
until
he
unraveled
the
mystery
in
the
most
interesting
of
autobiographies
but
frederick
douglass
was
still
calking
the
seams
of
baltimore
clippers
and
had
only
written
a
pass
at
the
age
when
miller
s
style
was
already
formed
i
asked
william
whipper
of
pennsylvania
the
gentleman
alluded
to
above
whether
he
thought
douglass
s
power
inherited
from
the
negroid
or
from
what
is
called
the
caucasian
side
of
his
make
up
after
some
reflection
he
frankly
answered
i
must
admit
although
sorry
to
do
so
that
the
caucasian
at
that
time
i
almost
agreed
with
him
but
facts
narrated
in
the
first
part
of
this
work
throw
a
different
light
on
this
interesting
question
we
are
left
in
the
dark
as
to
who
was
the
paternal
ancestor
of
our
author
a
fact
which
generally
holds
good
of
the
romuluses
and
remuses
who
are
to
inaugurate
the
new
birth
of
our
republic
in
the
absence
of
testimony
from
the
caucasian
side
we
must
see
what
evidence
is
given
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
my
grandmother
though
advanced
in
years
was
yet
a
woman
of
power
and
spirit
she
was
marvelously
straight
in
figure
elastic
and
p
after
describing
her
skill
in
constructing
nets
her
perseverance
in
using
them
and
her
fame
in
the
agricultural
way
he
adds
it
happened
to
her
as
it
will
happen
to
any
careful
and
thrifty
person
residing
in
an
ignorant
and
improvident
neighborhood
to
enjoy
the
reputation
of
being
born
to
good
and
his
grandmother
was
a
black
woman
my
mother
was
tall
and
finely
proportioned
of
deep
black
glossy
complexion
had
regular
features
and
among
other
slaves
was
remarkably
sedate
in
her
being
a
field
hand
she
was
obliged
to
walk
twelve
miles
and
return
between
nightfall
and
daybreak
to
see
her
children
p
i
shall
never
forget
the
indescribable
expression
of
her
countenance
when
i
told
her
that
i
had
had
no
food
since
morning
there
was
pity
in
her
glance
at
me
and
a
fiery
indignation
at
aunt
katy
at
the
same
time
she
read
aunt
katy
a
lecture
which
she
never
p
i
learned
after
my
mother
s
death
that
she
could
read
and
that
she
was
the
one
of
all
the
slaves
and
colored
people
in
tuckahoe
who
enjoyed
that
advantage
how
she
acquired
this
knowledge
i
know
not
for
tuckahoe
is
the
last
place
in
the
world
where
she
would
be
apt
to
find
facilities
for
p
there
is
in
s
natural
history
of
the
head
of
a
figure
on
page
the
features
of
which
so
resemble
those
of
my
mother
that
i
often
recur
to
it
with
something
of
the
feeling
which
i
suppose
others
experience
when
looking
upon
the
pictures
of
dear
departed
p
the
head
alluded
to
is
copied
from
the
statue
of
ramses
the
great
an
egyptian
king
of
the
nineteenth
dynasty
the
authors
of
the
of
give
a
side
view
of
the
same
on
page
remarking
that
the
profile
like
napoleon
s
is
superbly
european
the
nearness
of
its
resemblance
to
douglass
mother
rests
upon
the
evidence
of
his
memory
and
judging
from
his
almost
marvelous
feats
of
recollection
of
forms
and
outlines
recorded
in
this
book
this
testimony
may
be
admitted
these
facts
show
that
for
his
energy
perseverance
eloquence
invective
sagacity
and
wide
sympathy
he
is
indebted
to
his
negro
blood
the
very
marvel
of
his
style
would
seem
to
be
a
development
of
that
other
marvel
how
his
mother
learned
to
read
the
versatility
of
talent
which
he
wields
in
common
with
dumas
ira
aldridge
and
miss
greenfield
would
seem
to
be
the
result
of
the
grafting
of
the
on
good
original
negro
stock
if
the
friends
of
caucasus
choose
to
claim
for
that
region
what
remains
after
this
analysis
to
wit
combination
they
are
welcome
to
it
they
will
forgive
me
for
reminding
them
that
the
term
caucasian
is
dropped
by
recent
writers
on

of

thinly

name
well
known
to
all

it
was
given
to
this
section
of

probably
at
the
first
merely
in
derision
or
it
may
possibly
have
been
applied
to
it
as
i
have
heard
because
some
one
of

earlier
inhabitants
had
been
guilty
of
the
petty
meanness
of
stealing

whatever
may
have
been

about
this
i
will
not
be
positive
that
name
has
stuck
to
the
district
in
question
and
it
is
seldom
mentioned
but
with
contempt
and
derision
on
account
of
the
barrenness
of
its
soil
and
the
ignorance
indolence
and
poverty
of
its
people
decay
and
ruin
are
everywhere
visible
and
the

population
of

place
would
have
quitted

long

for
the

runs
through

from
which
they
take

of

was
in

unthrifty
district

surrounded
by
a
white
population
of
the
lowest
order
indolent
and
drunken
to
a
proverb
and
among
slaves
who
seemed
to
ask
oh
what
s
the
use
every
time
they
lifted
a
hoe
that
i
without
any
fault
of
mine
was
born
and
spent
the
first
years
of
my
childhood
the
reader
will
pardon
so
much
about
the
place
of
my
birth
on
the
score
that
it
is
always
a
fact
of
some
importance
to
know
where
a
man
is
born
if
indeed
it
be
important
to
know
anything
about
him
in
regard
to
the
of
my
birth
i
can
not
be
as
definite
as
i
have
been
respecting
the
nor
indeed
can
i
impart
much
knowledge
concerning
my

a
person
of
some
consequence
here
in
the
north
sometimes
designated
is
literally
abolished
in
slave
law
and
slave
practice
it
is
only
once
in
a
while
that
an
exception
is
found
to
this
statement
i
never
met
with
a
slave
who
could
tell
me
how
old
he
was
few
know
anything
of
the
months
of
the
year
nor
of
the
days
of
the
month
they
keep
no
family
records
with
marriages
births
and
deaths
they
measure
the
ages
of
their
children
by
spring
time
winter
time
harvest
time
planting
time
and
the
like
but
these
soon
become
undistinguishable
and
forgotten
like
other
slaves
i
can
not
tell
how
old
i
am
this
destitution
was
among
my
earliest
troubles
i
learned
when
i
grew
up
that
my
master
and
this
is
the
case
with
masters
generally
allowed
no
questions
to
be
put
to
him
by
which
a
slave
might
learn
his
grandparents
age
such
questions
deemed
evidence
of
impatience
and
even
of
impudent
curiosity
from
certain
events
however
the
dates
of
which
i
have
since
learned
i
suppose
myself
to
have
been
born
about
the
year
the
first
experience
of
life
with
me
that
i
now
remember
and
i
remember
it
but
hazily
began
in
the
family
of
my
grandmother
and
grandfather
betsey
and
isaac
baily
they
were
quite
advanced
in
life
and
had
long
lived
on
the
spot
where
they
then
resided
they
were
considered
old
settlers
in
the
neighborhood
and
from
certain
circumstances
i
infer
that
my
grandmother
especially
was
held
in
high
esteem
far
higher
than
is
the
lot
of
most
colored
persons
in
the
slave
states
she
was
a
good
nurse
and
a
capital
hand
at
making
nets
for
catching
shad
and
herring
and
these
nets
were
in
great
demand
not
only
in
tuckahoe
but
at
denton
and
hillsboro
neighboring
villages
she
was
not
only
good
at
making
the
nets
but
was
also
somewhat
famous
for
her
good
fortune
in
taking
the
fishes
referred
to
i
have
known
her
to
be
in
the
water
half
the
day
grandmother
was
likewise
more
provident
than
most
of
her
neighbors
in
the
preservation
of
seedling
sweet
potatoes
and
it
happened
to
her
as
it
will
happen
to
any
careful
and
thrifty
person
residing
in
an
ignorant
and
improvident
community
to
enjoy
the
reputation
of
having
been
born
to
good
her
good
luck
was
owing
to
the
exceeding
care
which
she
took
in
preventing
the
succulent
root
from
getting
bruised
in
the
digging
and
in
placing
it
beyond
the
reach
of
frost
by
actually
burying
it
under
the
hearth
of
her
cabin
during
the
winter
months
in
the
time
of
planting
sweet
potatoes
grandmother
betty
as
she
was
familiarly
called
was
sent
for
in
all
directions
simply
to
place
the
seedling
potatoes
in
the
hills
for
superstition
had
it
that
if
grandmamma
betty
but
touches
them
at
planting
they
will
be
sure
to
grow
and
this
high
reputation
was
full
of
advantage
to
her
and
to
the
children
around
her
though
tuckahoe
had
but
few
of
the
good
things
of
life
yet
of
such
as
it
did
possess
grandmother
got
a
full
share
in
the
way
of
presents
if
good
potato
crops
came
after
her
planting
she
was
not
forgotten
by
those
for
whom
she
planted
and
as
she
was
remembered
by
others
so
she
remembered
the
hungry
little
ones
around
her
the
dwelling
of
my
grandmother
and
grandfather
had
few
pretensions
it
was
a
log
hut
or
cabin
built
of
clay
wood
and
straw
at
a
distance
it
resembled
though
it
was
smaller
less
commodious
and
less
substantial
the
cabins
erected
in
the
western
states
by
the
first
settlers
to
my
child
s
eye
however
it
was
a
noble
structure
admirably
adapted
to
promote
the
comforts
and
conveniences
of
its
inmates
a
few
rough
virginia
flung
loosely
over
the
rafters
above
answered
the
triple
purpose
of
floors
ceilings
and
bedsteads
to
be
sure
this
upper
apartment
was
reached
only
by
a
ladder
but
what
in
the
world
for
climbing
could
be
better
than
a
ladder
to
me
this
ladder
was
really
a
high
invention
and
possessed
a
sort
of
charm
as
i
played
with
delight
upon
the
rounds
of
it
in
this
little
hut
there
was
a
large
family
of
children
i
dare
not
say
how
many
my
grandmother
whether
because
too
old
for
field
service
or
because
she
had
so
faithfully
discharged
the
duties
of
her
station
in
early
life
i
know
not
enjoyed
the
high
privilege
of
living
in
a
cabin
separate
from
the
quarter
with
no
other
burden
than
her
own
support
and
the
necessary
care
of
the
little
children
imposed
she
evidently
esteemed
it
a
great
fortune
to
live
so
the
children
were
not
her
own
but
her
grandchildren
the
children
of
her
daughters
she
took
delight
in
having
them
around
her
and
in
attending
to
their
few
wants
the
practice
of
separating
children
from
their
mother
and
hiring
the
latter
out
at
distances
too
great
to
admit
of
their
meeting
except
at
long
intervals
is
a
marked
feature
of
the
cruelty
and
barbarity
of
the
slave
system
but
it
is
in
harmony
with
the
grand
aim
of
slavery
which
always
and
everywhere
is
to
reduce
man
to
a
level
with
the
brute
it
is
a
successful
method
of
obliterating
old
master
from
the
mind
and
heart
of
the
slave
all
just
ideas
of
the
sacredness
of
as
an
institution
most
of
the
children
however
in
this
instance
being
the
children
of
my
grandmother
s
daughters
the
notions
of
family
and
the
reciprocal
duties
and
benefits
of
the
relation
had
a
better
chance
of
being
understood
than
where
children
are
placed
as
they
often
are
in
the
hands
of
strangers
who
have
no
care
for
them
apart
from
the
wishes
of
their
masters
the
daughters
of
my
grandmother
were
five
in
number
their
names
were
jenny
esther
milly
priscilla
and
harriet
the
daughter
last
named
was
my
mother
of
whom
the
reader
shall
learn
more
living
here
with
my
dear
old
grandmother
and
grandfather
it
was
a
long
time
before
i
knew
myself
to
be
i
knew
many
other
things
before
i
knew
that
grandmother
and
grandfather
were
the
greatest
people
in
the
world
to
me
and
being
with
them
so
snugly
in
their
own
little
cabin
i
supposed
it
be
their
own
knowing
no
higher
authority
over
me
or
the
other
children
than
the
authority
of
grandmamma
for
a
time
there
was
nothing
to
disturb
me
but
as
i
grew
larger
and
older
i
learned
by
degrees
the
sad
fact
that
the
little
hut
and
the
lot
on
which
it
stood
belonged
not
to
my
dear
old
grandparents
but
to
some
person
who
lived
a
great
distance
off
and
who
was
called
by
grandmother
old
i
further
learned
the
sadder
fact
that
not
only
the
house
and
lot
but
that
grandmother
herself
grandfather
was
free
and
all
the
little
children
around
her
belonged
to
this
mysterious
personage
called
by
grandmother
with
every
mark
of
reverence
old
thus
early
did
clouds
and
shadows
begin
to
fall
upon
my
path
once
on
the
track
troubles
never
come
singly
i
was
not
long
in
finding
out
another
fact
still
more
grievous
to
my
childish
heart
i
was
told
that
this
old
master
whose
name
seemed
ever
to
be
mentioned
with
fear
and
shuddering
only
allowed
the
children
to
live
with
grandmother
for
a
limited
time
and
that
in
fact
as
soon
as
they
were
big
enough
they
were
promptly
taken
away
to
live
with
the
said
old
these
were
distressing
revelations
indeed
and
though
i
was
quite
too
young
to
comprehend
the
full
import
of
the
intelligence
and
mostly
spent
my
childhood
days
in
gleesome
sports
with
the
other
children
a
shade
of
disquiet
rested
upon
me
the
absolute
power
of
this
distant
old
master
had
touched
my
young
spirit
with
but
the
point
of
its
cold
cruel
iron
and
left
me
something
to
brood
over
after
the
play
and
in
moments
of
repose
grandmammy
was
indeed
at
that
time
all
the
world
to
me
and
the
thought
of
being
separated
from
her
in
any
considerable
time
was
more
than
an
unwelcome
intruder
it
was
intolerable
children
have
their
sorrows
as
well
as
men
and
women
and
it
would
be
well
to
remember
this
in
our
dealings
with
them
children
and
prove
no
exceptions
to
the
general
rule
the
liability
to
be
separated
from
my
grandmother
seldom
or
never
to
see
her
again
haunted
me
i
dreaded
the
thought
of
going
to
live
with
that
mysterious
old
master
whose
name
i
never
heard
mentioned
with
affection
but
always
with
fear
i
look
back
to
this
as
among
the
heaviest
of
my
childhood
s
sorrows
my
grandmother
my
grandmother
and
the
little
hut
and
the
joyous
circle
under
her
care
but
especially
who
made
us
sorry
when
she
left
us
but
for
an
hour
and
glad
on
her
return
how
could
i
leave
her
and
the
good
old
home
but
the
sorrows
of
childhood
like
the
pleasures
of
after
life
are
transient
it
is
not
even
within
the
power
of
slavery
to
write
sorrow
at
a
single
dash
over
the
heart
of
a
child
tear
down
childhood
s
cheek
that
flows
is
like
the
on
the
rose
when
next
the
summer
breeze
comes
by
and
waves
the
bush
the
flower
is
there
is
after
all
but
little
difference
in
the
measure
of
contentment
felt
by
the
neglected
and
the
slaveholder
s
comparative
happiness
child
cared
for
and
petted
the
spirit
of
the
all
just
mercifully
holds
the
balance
for
the
young
the
slaveholder
having
nothing
to
fear
from
impotent
childhood
easily
affords
to
refrain
from
cruel
inflictions
and
if
cold
and
hunger
do
not
pierce
the
tender
frame
the
first
seven
or
eight
years
of
the
s
life
are
about
as
full
of
sweet
content
as
those
of
the
most
favored
and
petted
children
of
the
slaveholder
the
escapes
many
troubles
which
befall
and
vex
his
white
brother
he
seldom
has
to
listen
to
lectures
on
propriety
of
behavior
or
on
anything
else
he
is
never
chided
for
handling
his
little
knife
and
fork
improperly
or
awkwardly
for
he
uses
none
he
is
never
reprimanded
for
soiling
the
for
he
takes
his
meals
on
the
clay
floor
he
never
has
the
misfortune
in
his
games
or
sports
of
soiling
or
tearing
his
clothes
for
he
has
almost
none
to
soil
or
tear
he
is
never
expected
to
act
like
a
nice
little
gentleman
for
he
is
only
a
rude
little
slave
thus
freed
from
all
restraint
the
can
be
in
his
life
and
conduct
a
genuine
boy
doing
whatever
his
boyish
nature
suggests
enacting
by
turns
all
the
strange
antics
and
freaks
of
horses
dogs
pigs
and
fowls
without
in
any
manner
compromising
his
dignity
or
incurring
reproach
of
any
sort
he
literally
runs
wild
has
no
pretty
little
verses
to
learn
in
the
nursery
no
nice
little
speeches
to
make
for
aunts
uncles
or
cousins
to
show
how
smart
he
is
and
if
he
can
only
manage
to
keep
out
of
the
way
of
the
heavy
feet
and
fists
of
the
older
slave
boys
he
may
trot
on
in
his
joyous
and
roguish
tricks
as
happy
as
any
little
heathen
under
the
palm
trees
of
africa
to
be
sure
he
is
occasionally
reminded
when
he
stumbles
in
the
path
of
his
master
and
this
he
early
learns
to
avoid
that
he
is
eating
his
white
bread
and
that
he
will
be
made
to
see
sights
the
threat
is
soon
forgotten
the
shadow
soon
passes
and
our
sable
boy
continues
to
roll
in
the
dust
or
play
in
the
mud
as
bests
suits
him
and
in
the
veriest
freedom
if
he
feels
uncomfortable
from
mud
or
from
dust
the
coast
is
clear
he
can
plunge
into
the
river
or
the
pond
without
the
ceremony
of
undressing
or
the
fear
of
wetting
his
clothes
his
little
shirt
for
that
is
all
he
has
on
is
easily
dried
and
it
needed
ablution
as
much
as
did
his
skin
his
food
is
of
the
coarsest
kind
consisting
for
the
most
part
of
cornmeal
mush
which
often
finds
it
way
from
the
wooden
tray
to
his
mouth
in
an
oyster
shell
his
days
when
the
weather
is
warm
are
spent
in
the
pure
open
air
and
in
the
bright
sunshine
he
always
sleeps
in
airy
apartments
he
seldom
has
to
take
powders
or
to
be
paid
to
swallow
pretty
little
pills
to
cleanse
his
blood
or
to
quicken
his
appetite
he
eats
no
candies
gets
no
lumps
of
loaf
sugar
always
relishes
his
food
cries
but
little
for
nobody
cares
for
his
crying
learns
to
esteem
his
bruises
but
slight
because
others
so
esteem
them
in
a
word
he
is
for
the
most
part
of
the
first
eight
years
of
his
life
a
spirited
joyous
uproarious
and
happy
boy
upon
whom
troubles
fall
only
like
water
on
a
duck
s
back
and
such
a
boy
so
far
as
i
can
now
remember
was
the
boy
whose
life
in
slavery
i
am
now
narrating
chapter
ii
from
my
first

on
reaching

s
departure

strange
meeting
of
sisters
and
brothers
refusal
to
be

that
mysterious
individual
referred
to
in
the
first
chapter
as
an
object
of
terror
among
the
inhabitants
of
our
little
cabin
under
the
ominous
title
of
old
master
was
really
a
man
of
some
consequence
he
owned
several
farms
in
tuckahoe
was
the
chief
clerk
and
butler
on
the
home
plantation
of
edward
lloyd
had
overseers
on
his
own
farms
and
gave
directions
to
overseers
on
the
farms
belonging
to
lloyd
this
plantation
is
situated
on
wye
river
the
river
receiving
its
name
doubtless
from
wales
where
the
lloyds
originated
they
the
lloyds
are
an
old
and
honored
family
in
maryland
exceedingly
wealthy
the
home
plantation
where
they
have
resided
perhaps
for
a
century
or
more
is
one
of
the
largest
most
fertile
and
best
appointed
in
the
state
about
this
plantation
and
about
that
queer
old
master
who
must
be
something
more
than
a
man
and
something
worse
than
an
angel
the
reader
will
easily
imagine
that
i
was
not
only
curious
but
eager
to
know
all
that
could
be
known
unhappily
for
me
however
all
the
information
i
could
get
concerning
him
increased
my
great
dread
of
being
carried
thither
of
being
separated
from
and
deprived
of
the
protection
of
my
grandmother
and
grandfather
it
was
evidently
a
great
thing
to
go
to
lloyd
s
and
i
was
not
without
a
little
curiosity
to
see
the
place
but
no
amount
of
coaxing
could
induce
in
me
the
wish
to
remain
there
the
fact
is
such
was
my
dread
of
leaving
the
little
cabin
that
i
wished
to
remain
little
forever
for
i
knew
the
taller
i
grew
the
shorter
my
stay
the
old
cabin
with
its
rail
floor
and
rail
bedsteads
upstairs
and
its
clay
floor
downstairs
and
its
dirt
chimney
and
windowless
sides
and
that
most
curious
piece
of
workmanship
dug
in
front
of
the
fireplace
beneath
which
grandmammy
placed
the
sweet
potatoes
to
keep
them
from
the
frost
was
my
home
the
only
home
i
ever
had
and
i
loved
it
and
all
connected
with
it
the
old
fences
around
it
and
the
stumps
in
the
edge
of
the
woods
near
it
and
the
squirrels
that
ran
skipped
and
played
upon
them
were
objects
of
interest
and
affection
there
too
right
at
the
side
of
the
hut
stood
the
old
well
with
its
stately
and
beam
so
aptly
placed
between
the
limbs
of
what
had
once
been
a
tree
and
so
nicely
balanced
that
i
could
move
it
up
and
down
with
only
one
hand
and
could
get
a
drink
myself
without
calling
for
help
where
else
in
the
world
could
such
a
well
be
found
and
where
could
such
another
home
be
met
with
nor
were
these
all
the
attractions
of
the
place
down
in
a
little
valley
not
far
from
grandmammy
s
cabin
stood
lee
s
mill
where
the
people
came
often
in
large
numbers
to
get
their
corn
ground
it
was
a
watermill
and
i
never
shall
be
able
to
tell
the
many
things
thought
and
felt
while
i
sat
on
the
bank
and
watched
that
mill
and
the
turning
of
that
ponderous
wheel
the
too
had
its
charms
and
with
my
pinhook
and
thread
line
i
could
get
if
i
could
catch
no
fish
but
in
all
my
sports
and
plays
and
in
spite
of
them
there
would
occasionally
come
the
painful
foreboding
that
i
was
not
long
to
remain
there
and
that
i
must
soon
be
called
away
to
the
home
of
old
master
i
was
a
slave
born
a
slave
and
though
the
fact
was
in
departure
from
tuckahoe
comprehensible
to
me
it
conveyed
to
my
mind
a
sense
of
my
entire
dependence
on
the
will
of
i
had
never
seen
and
from
some
cause
or
other
i
had
been
made
to
fear
this
somebody
above
all
else
on
earth
born
for
another
s
benefit
as
the
of
the
cabin
flock
i
was
soon
to
be
selected
as
a
meet
offering
to
the
fearful
and
inexorable
whose
huge
image
on
so
many
occasions
haunted
my
childhood
s
imagination
when
the
time
of
my
departure
was
decided
upon
my
grandmother
knowing
my
fears
and
in
pity
for
them
kindly
kept
me
ignorant
of
the
dreaded
event
about
to
transpire
up
to
the
morning
a
beautiful
summer
morning
when
we
were
to
start
and
indeed
during
the
whole
journey
a
journey
which
child
as
i
was
i
remember
as
well
as
if
it
were
yesterday
she
kept
the
sad
fact
hidden
from
me
this
reserve
was
necessary
for
could
i
have
known
all
i
should
have
given
grandmother
some
trouble
in
getting
me
started
as
it
was
i
was
helpless
and
she
dear
woman
led
me
along
by
the
hand
resisting
with
the
reserve
and
solemnity
of
a
priestess
all
my
inquiring
looks
to
the
last
the
distance
from
tuckahoe
to
wye
river
where
my
old
master
lived
was
full
twelve
miles
and
the
walk
was
quite
a
severe
test
of
the
endurance
of
my
young
legs
the
journey
would
have
proved
too
severe
for
me
but
that
my
dear
old
grandmother
blessings
on
her
memory
afforded
occasional
relief
by
toting
me
as
marylanders
have
it
on
her
shoulder
my
grandmother
though
advanced
in
years
as
was
evident
from
more
than
one
gray
hair
which
peeped
from
between
the
ample
and
graceful
folds
of
her
bandana
turban
was
yet
a
woman
of
power
and
spirit
she
was
marvelously
straight
in
figure
elastic
and
muscular
i
seemed
hardly
to
be
a
burden
to
her
she
would
have
toted
me
farther
but
that
i
felt
myself
too
much
of
a
man
to
allow
it
and
insisted
on
walking
releasing
dear
grandmamma
from
carrying
me
did
not
make
me
altogether
independent
of
her
when
we
happened
to
pass
through
portions
of
the
somber
woods
which
lay
between
tuckahoe
and
wye
river
she
often
found
me
increasing
the
energy
of
my
grip
and
holding
her
clothing
lest
something
should
come
out
of
the
woods
and
eat
me
up
several
old
logs
and
stumps
imposed
upon
me
and
got
themselves
taken
for
wild
beasts
i
could
see
their
legs
eyes
and
ears
or
i
could
see
something
like
eyes
legs
and
ears
till
i
got
close
enough
to
them
to
see
that
the
eyes
were
knots
washed
white
with
rain
and
the
legs
were
broken
limbs
and
the
ears
only
ears
owing
to
the
point
from
which
they
were
seen
thus
early
i
learned
that
the
point
from
which
a
thing
is
viewed
is
of
some
importance
as
the
day
advanced
the
heat
increased
and
it
was
not
until
the
afternoon
that
we
reached
the
much
dreaded
end
of
the
journey
i
found
myself
in
the
midst
of
a
group
of
children
of
many
colors
black
brown
copper
colored
and
nearly
white
i
had
not
seen
so
many
children
before
great
houses
loomed
up
in
different
directions
and
a
great
many
men
and
women
were
at
work
in
the
fields
all
this
hurry
noise
and
singing
was
very
different
from
the
stillness
of
tuckahoe
as
a
new
comer
i
was
an
object
of
special
interest
and
after
laughing
and
yelling
around
me
and
playing
all
sorts
of
wild
tricks
they
the
children
asked
me
to
go
out
and
play
with
them
this
i
refused
to
do
preferring
to
stay
with
grandmamma
i
could
not
help
feeling
that
our
being
there
boded
no
good
to
me
grandmamma
looked
sad
she
was
soon
to
lose
another
object
of
affection
as
she
had
lost
many
before
i
knew
she
was
unhappy
and
the
shadow
fell
from
her
brow
on
me
though
i
knew
not
the
cause
all
suspense
however
must
have
an
end
and
the
end
of
mine
in
this
instance
was
at
hand
affectionately
patting
me
on
the
head
and
exhorting
me
to
be
a
good
boy
grandmamma
told
me
to
go
and
play
with
the
little
children
they
are
kin
to
you
said
she
go
and
play
with
among
a
number
of
cousins
were
phil
tom
steve
and
jerry
nance
and
betty
grandmother
pointed
out
my
brother
perry
my
sister
sarah
and
my
sister
eliza
who
stood
in
the
group
i
had
never
seen
brothers
and
sisters
my
brother
nor
my
sisters
before
and
though
i
had
sometimes
heard
of
them
and
felt
a
curious
interest
in
them
i
really
did
not
understand
what
they
were
to
me
or
i
to
them
we
were
brothers
and
sisters
but
what
of
that
why
should
they
be
attached
to
me
or
i
to
them
brothers
and
sisters
we
were
by
blood
but
had
made
us
strangers
i
heard
the
words
brother
and
sisters
and
knew
they
must
mean
something
but
slavery
had
robbed
these
terms
of
their
true
meaning
the
experience
through
which
i
was
passing
they
had
passed
through
before
they
had
already
been
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
old
master
s
domicile
and
they
seemed
to
look
upon
me
with
a
certain
degree
of
compassion
but
my
heart
clave
to
my
grandmother
think
it
not
strange
dear
reader
that
so
little
sympathy
of
feeling
existed
between
us
the
conditions
of
brotherly
and
sisterly
feeling
were
wanting
we
had
never
nestled
and
played
together
my
poor
mother
like
many
other
had
many
but
no
family
the
domestic
hearth
with
its
holy
lessons
and
precious
endearments
is
abolished
in
the
case
of
a
and
her
children
little
children
love
one
another
are
words
seldom
heard
in
a
slave
cabin
i
really
wanted
to
play
with
my
brother
and
sisters
but
they
were
strangers
to
me
and
i
was
full
of
fear
that
grandmother
might
leave
without
taking
me
with
her
entreated
to
do
so
however
and
that
too
by
my
dear
grandmother
i
went
to
the
back
part
of
the
house
to
play
with
them
and
the
other
children
however
i
did
not
but
stood
with
my
back
against
the
wall
witnessing
the
playing
of
the
others
at
last
while
standing
there
one
of
the
children
who
had
been
in
the
kitchen
ran
up
to
me
in
a
sort
of
roguish
glee
exclaiming
fed
fed
grandmammy
gone
grandmammy
gone
i
could
not
believe
it
yet
fearing
the
worst
i
ran
into
the
kitchen
to
see
for
myself
and
found
it
even
so
grandmammy
had
indeed
gone
and
was
now
far
away
clean
out
of
sight
i
need
not
tell
all
that
happened
now
almost
at
the
discovery
i
fell
upon
the
ground
and
wept
a
boy
s
bitter
tears
refusing
to
be
comforted
my
brother
and
sisters
came
around
me
and
said
don
t
cry
and
gave
me
peaches
and
pears
but
i
flung
them
away
and
refused
all
their
kindly
advances
i
had
never
been
deceived
before
and
i
felt
not
only
grieved
at
parting
as
i
supposed
forever
with
my
grandmother
but
indignant
that
a
trick
had
been
played
upon
me
in
a
matter
so
serious
it
was
now
late
in
the
afternoon
the
day
had
been
an
exciting
and
wearisome
one
and
i
knew
not
how
or
where
but
i
suppose
i
sobbed
myself
to
sleep
there
is
a
healing
in
the
angel
wing
of
sleep
even
for
the
and
its
balm
was
never
more
welcome
to
any
wounded
soul
than
it
was
to
mine
the
first
night
i
spent
at
the
domicile
of
old
master
the
reader
may
be
surprised
that
i
narrate
so
minutely
an
incident
apparently
so
trivial
and
which
must
have
occurred
when
i
was
not
more
than
seven
years
old
but
as
i
wish
to
give
a
faithful
history
of
my
experience
in
slavery
i
can
not
withhold
a
circumstance
which
at
the
time
affected
me
so
deeply
besides
this
was
in
fact
my
first
introduction
to
the
realities
of
slavery
chapter
iii
my
father
shrouded
in
mystery
my
mother
her
personal

if
the
reader
will
now
be
kind
enough
to
allow
me
time
to
grow
bigger
and
afford
me
an
opportunity
for
my
experience
to
become
greater
i
will
tell
him
something
of
slave
life
as
i
saw
felt
and
heard
it
on
edward
lloyd
s
plantation
and
at
the
house
of
old
master
where
i
had
now
despite
of
myself
most
suddenly
but
not
unexpectedly
been
dropped
meanwhile
i
will
redeem
my
promise
to
say
something
more
of
my
dear
mother
i
say
nothing
of
for
he
is
shrouded
in
a
mystery
i
have
never
been
able
to
penetrate
slavery
does
away
with
fathers
as
it
does
away
with
families
slavery
has
no
use
for
either
fathers
or
families
and
its
laws
do
not
recognize
their
existence
in
the
social
arrangements
of
the
plantation
when
they
exist
they
are
not
the
outgrowths
of
slavery
but
are
antagonistic
to
that
system
the
order
of
civilization
is
reversed
here
the
name
of
the
child
is
not
expected
to
be
that
of
its
father
and
his
condition
does
not
necessarily
affect
that
of
the
child
he
may
be
the
slave
of
tilgman
and
his
child
when
born
may
be
the
slave
of
mr
gross
he
may
be
a
and
yet
his
child
may
be
a
he
may
be
white
glorying
in
the
purity
of
his
blood
and
his
child
may
be
ranked
with
the
blackest
slaves
indeed
he
be
and
often
master
and
father
to
the
same
child
he
can
be
father
without
being
a
husband
and
may
sell
his
child
without
incurring
reproach
if
the
child
be
by
a
woman
in
whose
veins
courses
one
part
of
african
blood
my
father
was
a
white
man
or
nearly
white
it
was
sometimes
whispered
that
my
master
was
my
father
but
to
return
or
rather
to
begin
my
knowledge
of
my
mother
is
very
scanty
but
very
distinct
her
personal
appearance
and
bearing
are
ineffaceably
stamped
upon
my
memory
she
was
tall
and
finely
proportioned
of
deep
black
glossy
complexion
had
regular
features
and
among
the
other
slaves
was
remarkably
sedate
in
her
manners
there
is
in
s
natural
history
of
the
head
of
a
figure
on
page
the
features
of
which
so
resemble
those
of
my
mother
that
i
often
recur
to
it
with
something
of
the
feeling
which
i
suppose
others
experience
when
looking
upon
the
pictures
of
dear
departed
ones
yet
i
can
not
say
that
i
was
very
deeply
attached
to
my
mother
certainly
not
so
deeply
as
i
should
have
been
had
our
relations
in
childhood
been
different
we
were
separated
according
to
the
common
custom
when
i
was
but
an
infant
and
of
course
before
i
knew
my
mother
from
any
one
else
the
germs
of
affection
with
which
the
almighty
in
his
wisdom
and
mercy
arms
the
hopeless
infant
against
the
ills
and
vicissitudes
of
his
lot
had
been
directed
in
their
growth
toward
that
loving
old
grandmother
whose
gentle
hand
and
kind
deportment
it
was
in
the
first
effort
of
my
infantile
understanding
to
comprehend
and
appreciate
accordingly
the
tenderest
affection
which
a
beneficent
father
allows
as
a
partial
compensation
to
the
mother
for
the
pains
and
lacerations
of
her
heart
incident
to
the
maternal
relation
was
in
my
case
diverted
from
its
true
and
natural
object
by
the
envious
greedy
and
treacherous
hand
of
slavery
the
can
be
spared
long
enough
from
my
mother
the
field
to
endure
all
the
bitterness
of
a
mother
s
anguish
when
it
adds
another
name
to
a
master
s
ledger
but
long
enough
to
receive
the
joyous
reward
afforded
by
the
intelligent
smiles
of
her
child
i
never
think
of
this
terrible
interference
of
slavery
with
my
infantile
affections
and
its
diverting
them
from
their
natural
course
without
feelings
to
which
i
can
give
no
adequate
expression
i
do
not
remember
to
have
seen
my
mother
at
my
grandmother
s
at
any
time
i
remember
her
only
in
her
visits
to
me
at
lloyd
s
plantation
and
in
the
kitchen
of
my
old
master
her
visits
to
me
there
were
few
in
number
brief
in
duration
and
mostly
made
in
the
night
the
pains
she
took
and
the
toil
she
endured
to
see
me
tells
me
that
a
true
mother
s
heart
was
hers
and
that
slavery
had
difficulty
in
paralyzing
it
with
unmotherly
indifference
my
mother
was
hired
out
to
a
stewart
who
lived
about
twelve
miles
from
old
master
s
and
being
a
field
hand
she
seldom
had
leisure
by
day
for
the
performance
of
the
journey
the
nights
and
the
distance
were
both
obstacles
to
her
visits
she
was
obliged
to
walk
unless
chance
flung
into
her
way
an
opportunity
to
ride
and
the
latter
was
sometimes
her
good
luck
but
she
always
had
to
walk
one
way
or
the
other
it
was
a
greater
luxury
than
slavery
could
afford
to
allow
a
black
a
horse
or
a
mule
upon
which
to
travel
miles
when
she
could
walk
the
distance
besides
it
is
deemed
a
foolish
whim
for
a
to
manifest
concern
to
see
her
children
and
in
one
point
of
view
the
case
is
made
out
she
can
do
nothing
for
them
she
has
no
control
over
them
the
master
is
even
more
than
the
mother
in
all
matters
touching
the
fate
of
her
child
why
then
should
she
give
herself
any
concern
she
has
no
responsibility
such
is
the
reasoning
and
such
the
practice
the
iron
rule
of
the
plantation
always
passionately
and
violently
enforced
in
that
neighborhood
makes
flogging
the
penalty
of
failing
to
be
in
the
field
before
sunrise
in
the
morning
unless
special
permission
be
given
to
the
absenting
slave
i
went
to
see
my
child
is
no
excuse
to
the
ear
or
heart
of
the
overseer
one
of
the
visits
of
my
mother
to
me
while
at
lloyd
s
i
remember
very
vividly
as
affording
a
bright
gleam
of
a
mother
s
love
and
the
earnestness
of
a
mother
s
care
i
had
on
that
day
offended
aunt
katy
called
aunt
by
way
of
respect
the
cook
of
old
master
s
establishment
i
do
not
now
remember
the
nature
of
my
offense
in
this
instance
for
my
offenses
were
numerous
in
that
quarter
greatly
depending
however
upon
the
mood
of
aunt
katy
as
to
their
heinousness
but
she
had
adopted
that
day
her
favorite
mode
of
punishing
me
namely
making
me
go
without
food
all
day
that
is
from
after
breakfast
the
first
hour
or
two
after
dinner
i
succeeded
pretty
well
in
keeping
up
my
spirits
but
though
i
made
an
excellent
stand
against
the
foe
and
fought
bravely
during
the
afternoon
i
knew
i
must
be
conquered
at
last
unless
i
got
the
accustomed
reenforcement
of
a
slice
of
corn
bread
at
sundown
sundown
came
but
and
in
its
stead
their
came
the
threat
with
a
scowl
well
suited
to
its
terrible
import
that
she
meant
to
the
life
out
of
me
brandishing
her
knife
she
chopped
off
the
heavy
slices
for
the
other
children
and
put
the
loaf
away
muttering
all
the
while
her
savage
designs
upon
myself
against
this
disappointment
for
i
was
expecting
that
her
heart
would
relent
at
last
i
made
an
extra
effort
to
maintain
my
dignity
but
when
i
saw
all
the
other
children
around
me
with
merry
and
satisfied
faces
i
could
stand
it
no
longer
i
went
out
behind
the
house
and
cried
like
a
fine
fellow
when
tired
of
this
i
returned
to
the
kitchen
sat
by
the
fire
and
brooded
over
my
hard
lot
i
was
too
hungry
to
sleep
while
i
sat
in
the
corner
i
caught
sight
of
an
ear
of
indian
corn
on
an
upper
shelf
of
the
kitchen
i
watched
my
chance
and
got
it
and
shelling
off
a
few
grains
i
put
it
back
again
the
grains
in
my
hand
i
quickly
put
in
some
ashes
and
covered
them
with
embers
to
roast
them
all
this
i
did
at
the
risk
of
getting
a
brutual
thumping
for
aunt
katy
could
beat
as
well
as
starve
me
my
corn
was
not
long
in
roasting
and
with
my
keen
appetite
it
did
not
matter
even
if
the
grains
were
not
exactly
done
i
eagerly
pulled
them
out
and
placed
them
on
my
stool
in
a
clever
little
pile
just
as
i
began
to
help
myself
to
my
very
dry
meal
in
came
my
dear
mother
and
now
dear
reader
a
scene
occurred
which
was
altogether
worth
beholding
and
to
me
it
was
instructive
as
well
as
interesting
the
friendless
and
hungry
boy
in
his
extremest
need
and
when
he
did
not
dare
to
look
for
succor
found
himself
in
the
strong
protecting
arms
of
a
mother
a
mother
who
was
at
the
moment
being
endowed
with
high
powers
of
manner
as
well
as
matter
more
than
a
match
for
all
his
enemies
i
shall
never
forget
the
indescribable
expression
of
her
countenance
when
i
told
her
that
i
had
had
no
food
since
morning
and
that
aunt
katy
said
she
meant
to
starve
the
life
out
of
there
was
pity
in
her
glance
at
me
and
a
fiery
indignation
at
aunt
katy
at
the
same
time
and
while
she
took
the
corn
from
me
and
gave
me
a
large
ginger
cake
in
its
stead
she
read
aunt
katy
a
lecture
which
she
never
forgot
my
mother
threatened
her
with
complaining
to
old
master
in
my
behalf
for
the
latter
though
harsh
and
cruel
himself
at
times
did
not
sanction
the
meanness
injustice
partiality
and
oppressions
enacted
by
aunt
katy
in
the
kitchen
that
night
i
learned
the
fact
that
i
was
not
only
a
child
but
child
the
sweet
cake
my
mother
gave
me
was
in
the
shape
of
a
heart
with
a
rich
dark
ring
glazed
upon
the
edge
of
it
i
was
victorious
and
well
off
for
the
moment
prouder
on
my
mother
s
knee
than
a
king
upon
his
throne
but
my
triumph
was
short
i
dropped
off
to
sleep
and
waked
in
the
morning
only
to
find
my
mother
gone
and
myself
left
at
the
mercy
of
the
sable
virago
dominant
in
my
old
master
s
kitchen
whose
fiery
wrath
was
my
constant
dread
i
do
not
remember
to
have
seen
my
mother
after
this
occurrence
death
soon
ended
the
little
communication
that
had
existed
between
us
and
with
it
i
believe
a
life
judging
from
her
weary
sad
countenance
and
mute
demeanor
full
of
heartfelt
sorrow
i
was
not
allowed
to
visit
her
during
any
part
of
her
long
illness
nor
did
i
see
her
for
a
long
time
before
she
was
taken
ill
and
died
the
heartless
and
ghastly
form
of
rises
between
mother
and
child
even
at
the
bed
of
death
the
mother
at
the
verge
of
the
grave
may
not
gather
her
children
to
impart
to
them
her
holy
admonitions
and
invoke
for
them
her
dying
benediction
the
lives
as
a
slave
and
is
left
to
die
as
a
beast
often
with
fewer
attentions
than
are
paid
to
a
favorite
horse
scenes
of
sacred
tenderness
around
the
never
forgotten
and
which
often
arrest
the
vicious
and
confirm
the
virtuous
during
life
must
be
looked
for
among
the
free
though
they
sometimes
occur
among
the
slaves
it
has
been
a
standing
grief
to
me
that
i
knew
so
little
of
my
mother
and
that
i
was
so
early
separated
from
her
the
counsels
of
her
love
must
have
been
beneficial
to
me
the
side
view
of
her
face
is
imaged
on
my
memory
and
i
take
few
steps
in
life
without
feeling
her
presence
but
the
image
is
mute
and
i
have
no
striking
words
of
her
s
treasured
up
i
learned
after
my
mother
s
death
that
she
could
read
and
that
she
was
the
one
of
all
the
slaves
and
colored
people
in
tuckahoe
who
enjoyed
that
advantage
how
she
acquired
this
knowledge
i
know
not
for
tuckahoe
is
the
last
place
in
the
world
where
she
would
be
apt
to
find
facilities
for
learning
i
can
therefore
fondly
and
proudly
ascribe
to
her
an
earnest
love
of
knowledge
that
a
field
hand
should
learn
to
read
in
any
slave
state
is
remarkable
but
the
achievement
of
my
mother
considering
the
place
was
very
extraordinary
and
in
view
of
that
fact
i
am
quite
willing
and
even
happy
to
attribute
any
love
of
letters
i
possess
and
for
which
i
have
got
despite
of
prejudices
only
too
much
credit
to
my
admitted
paternity
but
to
the
native
genius
of
my
sable
unprotected
and
uncultivated
a
woman
who
belonged
to
a
race
penalty
for
having
a
white
father
whose
mental
endowments
it
is
at
present
fashionable
to
hold
in
disparagement
and
contempt
summoned
away
to
her
account
with
the
impassable
gulf
of
slavery
between
us
during
her
entire
illness
my
mother
died
without
leaving
me
a
single
intimation
of
my
father
was
there
was
a
whisper
that
my
master
was
my
father
yet
it
was
only
a
whisper
and
i
can
not
say
that
i
ever
gave
it
credence
indeed
i
now
have
reason
to
think
he
was
not
nevertheless
the
fact
remains
in
all
its
glaring
odiousness
that
by
the
laws
of
slavery
children
in
all
cases
are
reduced
to
the
condition
of
their
mothers
this
arrangement
admits
of
the
greatest
license
to
brutal
slaveholders
and
their
profligate
sons
brothers
relations
and
friends
and
gives
to
the
pleasure
of
sin
the
additional
attraction
of
profit
a
whole
volume
might
be
written
on
this
single
feature
of
slavery
as
i
have
observed
it
one
might
imagine
that
the
children
of
such
connections
would
fare
better
in
the
hands
of
their
masters
than
other
slaves
the
rule
is
quite
the
other
way
and
a
very
little
reflection
will
satisfy
the
reader
that
such
is
the
case
a
man
who
will
enslave
his
own
blood
may
not
be
safely
relied
on
for
magnanimity
men
do
not
love
those
who
remind
them
of
their
sins
unless
they
have
a
mind
to
repent
and
the
mulatto
child
s
face
is
a
standing
accusation
against
him
who
is
master
and
father
to
the
child
what
is
still
worse
perhaps
such
a
child
is
a
constant
offense
to
the
wife
she
hates
its
very
presence
and
when
a
slaveholding
woman
hates
she
wants
not
means
to
give
that
hate
telling
effect
women
white
women
i
mean
are
idols
at
the
south
not
wives
for
the
slave
women
are
preferred
in
many
instances
and
if
these
but
nod
or
lift
a
finger
woe
to
the
poor
victim
kicks
cuffs
and
stripes
are
sure
to
follow
masters
are
frequently
compelled
to
sell
this
class
of
their
slaves
out
of
deference
to
the
feelings
of
their
white
wives
and
shocking
and
scandalous
as
it
may
seem
for
a
man
to
sell
his
own
blood
to
the
traffickers
in
human
flesh
it
is
often
an
act
of
humanity
toward
the
to
be
thus
removed
from
his
merciless
tormentors
it
is
not
within
the
scope
of
the
design
of
my
simple
story
to
comment
upon
every
phase
of
slavery
not
within
my
experience
as
a
slave
but
i
may
remark
that
if
the
lineal
descendants
of
ham
are
only
to
be
enslaved
according
to
the
scriptures
slavery
in
this
country
will
soon
become
an
unscriptural
institution
for
thousands
are
ushered
into
the
world
annually
who
like
myself
owe
their
existence
to
white
fathers
and
most
frequently
to
their
masters
and
master
s
sons
the
is
at
the
mercy
of
the
fathers
sons
or
brothers
of
her
master
the
thoughtful
know
the
rest
after
what
i
have
now
said
of
the
circumstances
of
my
mother
and
my
relations
to
her
the
reader
will
not
be
surprised
nor
be
disposed
to
censure
me
when
i
tell
but
the
simple
truth
viz
that
i
received
the
tidings
of
her
death
with
no
strong
emotions
of
sorrow
for
her
and
with
very
little
regret
for
myself
on
account
of
her
loss
i
had
to
learn
the
value
of
my
mother
long
after
her
death
and
by
witnessing
the
devotion
of
other
mothers
to
their
children
there
is
not
beneath
the
sky
an
enemy
to
filial
affection
so
destructive
as
slavery
it
had
made
my
brothers
and
sisters
strangers
to
me
it
converted
the
mother
that
bore
me
into
a
myth
it
shrouded
my
father
in
mystery
and
left
me
without
an
intelligible
beginning
in
the
world
my
mother
died
when
i
could
not
have
been
more
than
eight
or
nine
years
old
on
one
of
old
master
s
farms
in
tuckahoe
in
the
neighborhood
of
hillsborough
her
grave

his

of
rank
and

it
is
generally
supposed
that
slavery
in
the
state
of
maryland
exists
in
its
mildest
form
and
that
it
is
totally
divested
of
those
harsh
and
terrible
peculiarities
which
mark
and
characterize
the
slave
system
in
the
southern
and
states
of
the
american
union
the
argument
in
favor
of
this
opinion
is
the
contiguity
of
the
free
states
and
the
exposed
condition
of
slavery
in
maryland
to
the
moral
religious
and
humane
sentiment
of
the
free
states
i
am
not
about
to
refute
this
argument
so
far
as
it
relates
to
slavery
in
that
state
generally
on
the
contrary
i
am
willing
to
admit
that
to
this
general
point
the
arguments
is
well
grounded
public
opinion
is
indeed
an
unfailing
restraint
upon
the
cruelty
and
barbarity
of
masters
overseers
and
whenever
and
wherever
it
can
reach
them
but
there
are
certain
secluded
and
places
even
in
the
state
of
maryland
seldom
visited
by
a
single
ray
of
healthy
public
sentiment
where
slavery
wrapt
in
its
own
congenial
midnight
darkness
and
develop
all
its
malign
and
shocking
characteristics
where
it
can
be
indecent
without
shame
cruel
without
shuddering
and
murderous
without
apprehension
or
fear
of
exposure
just
such
a
secluded
dark
and
place
is
the
home
plantation
of
edward
lloyd
on
the
eastern
shore
maryland
it
is
far
away
from
all
the
great
thoroughfares
and
is
proximate
to
no
town
or
village
there
is
neither
nor
in
its
neighborhood
the
is
unnecessary
for
there
are
no
children
to
go
to
school
the
children
and
of
lloyd
were
taught
in
the
house
by
a
private
tutor
a
mr
page
a
tall
gaunt
sapling
of
a
man
who
did
not
speak
a
dozen
words
to
a
slave
in
a
whole
year
the
overseers
children
go
off
somewhere
to
school
and
they
therefore
bring
no
foreign
or
dangerous
influence
from
abroad
to
embarrass
the
natural
operation
of
the
slave
system
of
the
place
not
even
the
mechanics
through
whom
there
is
an
occasional
of
honest
and
telling
indignation
at
cruelty
and
wrong
on
other
plantations
are
white
men
on
this
plantation
its
whole
public
is
made
up
of
and
divided
into
three
classes
slaveholders

its

trusted
or
permitted
within
its
secluded
precincts
whether
with
a
view
of
guarding
against
the
escape
of
its
secrets
i
know
not
but
it
is
a
fact
the
every
leaf
and
grain
of
the
produce
of
this
plantation
and
those
of
the
neighboring
farms
belonging
to
lloyd
are
transported
to
baltimore
in
lloyd
s
own
vessels
every
man
and
boy
on
board
of
which
except
the
captain
are
owned
by
him
in
return
everything
brought
to
the
plantation
comes
through
the
same
channel
thus
even
the
glimmering
and
unsteady
light
of
trade
which
sometimes
exerts
a
civilizing
influence
is
excluded
from
this
tabooed
spot
nearly
all
the
plantations
or
farms
in
the
vicinity
of
the
home
plantation
of
lloyd
belong
to
him
and
those
which
do
not
are
owned
by
personal
friends
of
his
as
deeply
interested
in
maintaining
the
slave
system
in
all
its
rigor
as
lloyd
himself
some
of
his
neighbors
are
said
to
be
even
more
stringent
than
he
the
skinners
the
peakers
the
tilgmans
the
lockermans
and
the
gipsons
are
in
the
same
boat
being
slaveholding
neighbors
they
may
have
strengthened
each
other
in
their
iron
rule
they
are
on
intimate
terms
and
their
interests
and
tastes
are
identical
public
opinion
in
such
a
quarter
the
reader
will
see
is
not
likely
to
very
efficient
in
protecting
the
slave
from
cruelty
on
the
contrary
it
must
increase
and
intensify
his
wrongs
public
opinion
seldom
differs
very
widely
from
public
practice
to
be
a
restraint
upon
cruelty
and
vice
public
opinion
must
emanate
from
a
humane
and
virtuous
community
to
no
such
humane
and
virtuous
community
is
lloyd
s
plantation
exposed
that
plantation
is
a
little
nation
of
its
own
having
its
own
language
its
own
rules
regulations
and
customs
the
laws
and
institutions
of
the
state
apparently
touch
it
nowhere
the
troubles
arising
here
are
not
settled
by
the
civil
power
of
the
state
the
overseer
is
generally
accuser
judge
jury
advocate
and
executioner
the
criminal
is
always
dumb
the
overseer
attends
to
all
sides
of
a
case
there
are
no
conflicting
rights
of

for
all
the
people
are

by
one

can
themselves

religion

are
alike
excluded
one
class
of
the

high
to
be
reached
by
the

the
other
class
is
too
low
to

the

only
when
they

the

the

the

to
learn
politics
in
the
parlor
and
to
dispense
with
religion
altogether
in
its
isolation
seclusion
and
independence
lloyd
s
plantation
resembles
what
the
baronial
domains
were
during
the
middle
ages
in
europe
grim
cold
and
unapproachable
by
all
genial
influences
from
communities
without
it
stands
full
three
hundred
years
behind
the
age
in
all
that
relates
to
humanity
and
morals
this
however
is
not
the
only
view
that
the
place
presents
civilization
is
shut
out
but
nature
can
not
be
though
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
world
though
public
opinion
as
i
have
said
seldom
gets
a
chance
to
penetrate
its
dark
domain
though
the
whole
place
is
stamped
with
its
own
peculiar
ironlike
individuality
and
though
crimes
and
atrocious
may
there
be
committed
with
almost
as
much
impunity
as
upon
the
deck
of
a
pirate
ship
it
is
nevertheless
altogether
to
outward
seeming
a
most
strikingly
interesting
place
full
of
life
activity
and
spirit
and
presents
a
very
favorable
contrast
to
the
indolent
monotony
and
languor
of
tuckahoe
keen
as
was
my
regret
and
great
as
was
my
sorrow
at
leaving
the
latter
i
was
not
long
in
adapting
myself
to
this
my
new
home
a
man
s
troubles
are
always
half
disposed
of
when
he
finds
endurance
his
only
remedy
i
found
myself
here
there
was
no
getting
away
and
what
remained
for
me
but
to
make
the
best
of
it
here
were
plenty
of
children
to
play
with
and
plenty
of
places
of
pleasant
resort
for
boys
of
my
age
and
boys
older
the
little
tendrils
of
affection
so
rudely
and
treacherously
broken
from
around
the
darling
objects
of
my
grandmother
s
hut
gradually
began
to
extend
and
to
entwine
about
the
new
objects
by
which
i
now
found
myself
surrounded
there
was
a
windmill
always
a
commanding
object

or
more

was
a

to
swim
in
at
the
bottom
of
an
open
flat
space
of
twenty
acres

more

very
beautiful
for

a
short
distance
from

quietly

a

called
by
that

in

of

the

not
well
look

great
house
was
surrounded
by
numerous
and
variously
shaped
there
were
kitchens
dairies
and
arbors
of
many
sizes
and
devices
all
neatly
painted
and
altogether
interspersed
with
grand
old
trees
ornamental
and
primitive
which
afforded
delightful
shade
in
summer
and
imparted
to
the
scene
a
high
degree
of
stately
beauty
the
great
house
itself
was
a
large
white
wooden
building
with
wings
on
three
sides
of
it
in
front
a
large
portico
extending
the
entire
length
of
the
building
and
supported
by
a
long
range
of
columns
gave
to
the
whole
establishment
an
air
of
solemn
grandeur
it
was
a
treat
to
my
young
and
gradually
opening
mind
to
behold
this
elaborate
exhibition
of
wealth
power
and
vanity
the
carriage
entrance
to
the
house
was
a
large
gate
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
from
it
the
intermediate
space
was
a
beautiful
lawn
very
neatly
trimmed
and
watched
with
the
greatest
care
it
was
dotted
thickly
over
with
delightful
trees
shrubbery
and
flowers
the
road
or
lane
from
the
gate
to
the
great
house
was
richly
paved
with
white
pebbles
from
the
beach
and
in
its
course
formed
a
complete
circle
around
the
beautiful
lawn
carriages
going
in
and
retiring
from
the
great
house
made
the
circuit
of
the
lawn
and
their
passengers
were
permitted
to
behold
a
scene
of
almost
beauty
outside
this
select
inclosure
were
parks
where
as
about
the
residences
of
the
english
nobility
rabbits
deer
and
other
wild
game
might
be
seen
peering
and
playing
about
with
none
to
molest
them
or
make
them
afraid
the
tops
of
the
stately
poplars
were
often
covered
with
the
making
all
nature
vocal
with
the
joyous
life
and
beauty
of
their
wild
warbling
notes
these
all
belonged
to
me
as
well
as
to
edward
lloyd
and
for
a
time
i
greatly
enjoyed
them
a
short
distance
from
the
great
house
were
the
stately
mansions
of
the
dead
a
place
of
somber
aspect
vast
tombs
embowered
beneath
the
weeping
willow
and
the
fir
tree
told
of
the
antiquities
of
the
lloyd
family
as
well
as
of
their
wealth
superstition
was
rife
among
the
slaves
about
this
family
burying
ground
strange
sights
had
been
seen
there
by
some
of
the
older
slaves
shrouded
ghosts
riding
on
great
black
horses
had
been
seen
to
enter
balls
of
fire
had
been
seen
to
fly
there
at
midnight
and
horrid
sounds
had
been
repeatedly
heard
slaves
know
enough
of
the
rudiments
of
theology
to
believe
that
those
go
to
hell
who
die
slaveholders
and
they
often
fancy
such
persons
wishing
themselves
back
again
to
wield
the
lash
tales
of
sights
and
sounds
strange
and
terrible
connected
with
the
huge
black
tombs
were
a
very
great
security
to
the
grounds
about
them
for
few
of
the
slaves
felt
like
approaching
them
even
in
the
day
time
it
was
a
dark
gloomy
and
forbidding
place
and
it
was
difficult
to
feel
that
the
spirits
of
the
sleeping
dust
there
deposited
reigned
with
the
blest
in
the
realms
of
eternal
peace
the
business
of
twenty
or
thirty
farms
was
transacted
at
this
called
by
way
of
eminence
great
house
these
farms
all
belonged
to
lloyd
as
did
also
the
slaves
upon
them
each
farm
was
under
the
management
of
an
overseer
as
i
have
said
of
the
overseer
of
the
home
plantation
so
i
may
say
of
the
overseers
on
the
smaller
ones
they
stand
between
the
slave
and
all
civil
constitutions
their
word
is
law
and
is
implicitly
obeyed
the
colonel
at
this
time
was
reputed
to
be
and
he
apparently
was
very
rich
his
slaves
alone
were
an
immense
fortune
these
small
and
great
could
not
have
been
fewer
than
one
thousand
in
number
and
though
scarcely
a
month
passed
without
the
sale
of
one
or
more
lots
to
the
georgia
traders
there
was
no
apparent
diminution
in
the
number
of
his
human
stock
the
home
plantation
merely
groaned
at
a
removal
of
the
young
increase
or
human
crop
then
proceeded
as
lively
as
ever
coopering
grinding
and
weaving
for
all
the
neighboring
farms
were
performed
here
and
slaves
were
employed
in
all
these
branches
uncle
tony
was
the
blacksmith
uncle
harry
was
the
cartwright
uncle
abel
was
the
shoemaker
and
all
these
had
hands
to
assist
them
in
their
several
departments
these
mechanics
were
called
uncles
by
all
the
younger
slaves
not
because
they
really
sustained
that
relationship
to
any
but
according
to
plantation
as
a
mark
of
respect
due
from
the
younger
to
the
older
slaves
strange
and
even
ridiculous
as
it
may
seem
among
a
people
so
uncultivated
and
with
so
many
stern
trials
to
look
in
the
face
there
is
not
to
be
found
among
any
people
a
more
rigid
enforcement
of
the
law
of
respect
to
elders
than
they
maintain
i
set
this
down
as
partly
constitutional
with
my
race
and
partly
conventional
there
is
no
better
material
in
the
world
for
making
a
gentleman
than
is
furnished
in
the
african
he
shows
to
others
and
exacts
for
himself
all
the
tokens
of
respect
which
he
is
compelled
to
manifest
toward
his
master
a
young
slave
must
approach
the
company
of
the
older
with
hat
in
hand
and
woe
betide
him
if
he
fails
to
acknowledge
a
favor
of
any
sort
with
the
accustomed
tank
ee
so
uniformly
are
good
manners
enforced
among
slaves
i
can
easily
detect
a
bogus
fugitive
by
his
manners
among
other
slave
notabilities
of
the
plantation
was
one
called
by
everybody
uncle
isaac
copper
it
is
seldom
that
a
slave
gets
a
surname
from
anybody
in
maryland
and
so
completely
has
the
south
shaped
the
manners
of
the
north
in
this
respect
that
even
abolitionists
make
very
little
of
the
surname
of
a
negro
the
only
improvement
on
the
bills
jacks
jims
and
neds
of
the
south
observable
here
is
that
william
john
james
edward
are
substituted
it
goes
against
the
grain
to
treat
and
address
a
negro
precisely
as
they
would
treat
and
address
a
white
man
but
once
in
a
while
in
slavery
as
in
the
free
states
by
some
extraordinary
circumstance
the
negro
has
a
surname
fastened
to
him
and
holds
it
against
all
conventionalities
this
was
the
case
with
uncle
isaac
copper
when
the
uncle
was
dropped
he
generally
had
the
prefix
doctor
in
its
stead
he
was
our
doctor
of
medicine
and
doctor
of
divinity
as
well
where
he
took
his
degree
i
am
unable
to
say
for
he
was
not
very
communicative
to
inferiors
and
i
was
emphatically
such
being
but
a
boy
seven
or
eight
years
old
he
was
too
well
established
in
his
profession
to
permit
questions
as
to
his
native
skill
or
his
attainments
one
qualification
he
undoubtedly
had
he
praying
and
flogging
was
a
confirmed
and
he
could
neither
work
nor
would
he
bring
anything
if
offered
for
sale
in
the
market
the
old
man
though
lame
was
no
sluggard
he
was
a
man
that
made
his
crutches
do
him
good
service
he
was
always
on
the
alert
looking
up
the
sick
and
all
such
as
were
supposed
to
need
his
counsel
his
remedial
prescriptions
embraced
four
articles
for
diseases
of
the
body
salts
and
castor
oil
for
those
of
the
soul
lord
s
and
i
was
not
long
at
lloyd
s
before
i
was
placed
under
the
care
of
doctor
issac
copper
i
was
sent
to
him
with
twenty
or
thirty
other
children
to
learn
the
lord
s
i
found
the
old
gentleman
seated
on
a
huge
oaken
stool
armed
with
several
large
hickory
switches
and
from
his
position
he
could
reach
lame
as
he
was
any
boy
in
the
room
after
standing
awhile
to
learn
what
was
expected
of
us
the
old
gentleman
in
any
other
than
a
devotional
tone
commanded
us
to
kneel
down
this
done
he
commenced
telling
us
to
say
everything
he
said
our
father
this
was
repeated
after
him
with
promptness
and
uniformity
who
art
in
heaven
was
less
promptly
and
uniformly
repeated
and
the
old
gentleman
paused
in
the
prayer
to
give
us
a
short
lecture
upon
the
consequences
of
inattention
both
immediate
and
future
and
especially
those
more
immediate
about
these
he
was
absolutely
certain
for
he
held
in
his
right
hand
the
means
of
bringing
all
his
predictions
and
warnings
to
pass
on
he
proceeded
with
the
prayer
and
we
with
our
thick
tongues
and
unskilled
ears
followed
him
to
the
best
of
our
ability
this
however
was
not
sufficient
to
please
the
old
gentleman
everybody
in
the
south
wants
the
privilege
of
whipping
somebody
else
uncle
isaac
shared
the
common
passion
of
his
country
and
therefore
seldom
found
any
means
of
keeping
his
disciples
in
order
short
of
flogging
say
everything
i
say
and
bang
would
come
the
switch
on
some
poor
boy
s
undevotional
head
what
you
looking
at
there
stop
that
pushing
and
down
again
would
come
the
lash
the
whip
is
all
in
all
it
is
supposed
to
secure
obedience
to
the
slaveholder
and
is
held
as
a
sovereign
remedy
among
the
slaves
themselves
for
every
form
of
disobedience
temporal
or
spiritual
slaves
as
well
as
slaveholders
use
it
with
an
unsparing
hand
our
devotions
at
uncle
isaac
s
combined
too
much
of
the
tragic
and
comic
to
make
them
very
salutary
in
a
spiritual
point
of
view
and
it
is
due
to
truth
to
say
i
was
often
a
truant
when
the
time
for
attending
the
praying
and
flogging
of
doctor
isaac
copper
came
on
the
windmill
under
the
care
of
kinney
a
kind
hearted
old
englishman
was
to
me
a
source
of
infinite
interest
and
pleasure
the
old
man
always
seemed
pleased
when
he
saw
a
troop
of
darkey
little
urchins
with
their
shirts
fluttering
in
the
breeze
approaching
to
view
and
admire
the
whirling
wings
of
his
wondrous
machine
from
the
mill
we
could
see
other
objects
of
deep
interest
these
were
the
vessels
from
michael
s
on
their
way
to
baltimore
it
was
a
source
of
much
amusement
to
view
the
flowing
sails
and
complicated
rigging
as
the
little
crafts
dashed
by
and
to
speculate
upon
baltimore
as
to
the
kind
and
quality
of
the
place
with
so
many
sources
of
interest
around
me
the
reader
may
be
prepared
to
learn
that
i
began
to
think
very
highly
of
s
plantation
it
was
just
a
place
to
my
boyish
taste
there
were
fish
to
be
caught
in
the
creek
if
one
only
had
a
hook
and
line
and
crabs
clams
and
oysters
were
to
be
caught
by
wading
digging
and
raking
for
them
here
was
a
field
for
industry
and
enterprise
strongly
inviting
and
the
reader
may
be
assured
that
i
entered
upon
it
with
spirit
even
the
much
dreaded
old
master
whose
merciless
fiat
had
brought
me
from
tuckahoe
gradually
to
my
mind
parted
with
his
terrors
strange
enough
his
reverence
seemed
to
take
no
particular
notice
of
me
nor
of
my
coming
instead
of
leaping
out
and
devouring
me
he
scarcely
seemed
conscious
of
my
presence
the
fact
is
he
was
occupied
with
matters
more
weighty
and
important
than
either
looking
after
or
vexing
me
he
probably
thought
as
old
master
losing
its
terrors
little
of
my
advent
as
he
would
have
thought
of
the
addition
of
a
single
pig
to
his
stock
as
the
chief
butler
on
lloyd
s
plantation
his
duties
were
numerous
and
perplexing
in
almost
all
important
matters
he
answered
in
lloyd
s
stead
the
overseers
of
all
the
farms
were
in
some
sort
under
him
and
received
the
law
from
his
mouth
the
colonel
himself
seldom
addressed
an
overseer
or
allowed
an
overseer
to
address
him
old
master
carried
the
keys
of
all
store
houses
measured
out
the
allowance
for
each
slave
at
the
end
of
every
month
superintended
the
storing
of
all
goods
brought
to
the
plantation
dealt
out
the
raw
material
to
all
the
handicraftsmen
shipped
the
grain
tobacco
and
all
saleable
produce
of
the
plantation
to
market
and
had
the
general
oversight
of
the
coopers
shop
wheelwrights
shop
blacksmiths
shop
and
shoemakers
shop
besides
the
care
of
these
he
often
had
business
for
the
plantation
which
required
him
to
be
absent
two
and
three
days
thus
largely
employed
he
had
little
time
and
perhaps
as
little
disposition
to
interfere
with
the
children
individually
what
he
was
to
lloyd
he
made
aunt
katy
to
him
when
he
had
anything
to
say
or
do
about
us
it
was
said
or
done
in
a
wholesale
manner
disposing
of
us
in
classes
or
sizes
leaving
all
minor
details
to
aunt
katy
a
person
of
whom
the
reader
has
already
received
no
very
favorable
impression
aunt
katy
was
a
woman
who
never
allowed
herself
to
act
greatly
within
the
margin
of
power
granted
to
her
no
matter
how
broad
that
authority
might
be
ambitious
and
cruel
she
found
in
her
present
position
an
ample
field
for
the
exercise
of
her
qualities
she
had
a
strong
hold
on
old
master
she
was
considered
a
first
rate
cook
and
she
really
was
very
industrious
she
was
therefore
greatly
favored
by
old
master
and
as
one
mark
of
his
favor
she
was
the
only
mother
who
was
permitted
to
retain
her
children
around
her
even
to
these
children
she
was
often
fiendish
in
her
brutality
she
pursued
her
son
phil
one
day
in
my
presence
with
a
huge
butcher
knife
and
dealt
a
blow
with
its
edge
which
left
a
shocking
gash
on
his
arm
near
the
wrist
for
this
old
master
did
sharply
rebuke
her
and
threatened
that
if
she
ever
should
do
the
like
again
he
would
take
the
skin
off
her
back
cruel
however
as
aunt
katy
was
to
her
own
children
at
times
she
was
not
destitute
of
maternal
feeling
as
i
often
had
occasion
to
know
in
the
bitter
pinches
of
hunger
i
had
to
endure
differing
from
the
practice
of
lloyd
old
master
instead
of
allowing
so
much
for
each
slave
committed
the
allowance
for
all
to
the
care
of
aunt
katy
to
be
divided
after
cooking
it
amongst
us
the
allowance
consisting
of
coarse
was
not
very
abundant
indeed
it
was
very
slender
and
in
passing
through
aunt
katy
s
hands
it
was
made
more
slender
still
for
some
of
us
william
phil
and
jerry
were
her
children
and
it
is
not
to
accuse
her
too
severely
to
allege
that
she
was
often
guilty
of
starving
myself
and
the
other
children
while
she
was
literally
cramming
her
own
want
of
food
was
my
chief
trouble
the
first
summer
at
my
old
master
s
oysters
and
clams
would
do
very
well
with
an
occasional
supply
of
bread
but
they
soon
failed
in
the
absence
of
bread
i
speak
but
the
simple
truth
when
i
say
i
have
often
been
so
pinched
with
hunger
that
i
have
fought
with
the
dog
old
nep
for
the
smallest
crumbs
that
fell
from
the
kitchen
table
and
have
been
glad
when
i
won
a
single
crumb
in
the
combat
many
times
have
i
followed
with
eager
step
the
when
she
went
out
to
shake
the
table
cloth
to
get
the
crumbs
and
small
bones
flung
out
for
the
cats
the
water
in
which
meat
had
been
boiled
was
as
eagerly
sought
for
by
me
it
was
a
great
thing
to
get
the
privilege
of
dipping
a
piece
of
bread
in
such
water
and
the
skin
taken
from
rusty
bacon
was
a
positive
luxury
nevertheless
i
sometimes
got
full
meals
and
kind
words
from
sympathizing
old
slaves
who
knew
my
sufferings
and
received
the
comforting
assurance
that
i
should
be
a
man
some
day
never
mind
honey
better
day
comin
was
even
then
a
solace
a
cheering
consolation
to
me
in
my
troubles
nor
were
all
the
kind
words
i
received
from
slaves
i
had
a
friend
in
the
parlor
as
well
and
one
to
whom
i
shall
be
glad
to
do
justice
before
i
have
finished
this
part
of
my
story
i
was
not
long
at
old
master
s
before
i
learned
that
his
surname
was
anthony
and
that
he
was
generally
called
captain
anthony
a
title
which

where

could

less

of

from

immediate
associates
than
on
this
plantation
even
mas
daniel
by
his
association
with
his
father
s
slaves
had
measurably
adopted
their
dialect
and
their
ideas
so
far
as
they
had
ideas
to
be
adopted
the
equality
of
nature
is
strongly
asserted
in
childhood
and
childhood
requires
children

makes
no

with

are
you
a

common
to
children

the

as

mas
daniel
could
not
associate
with
ignorance
without
sharing
its
shade
and
he
could
not
give
his
black
playmates
his
company
without
giving
them
his
intelligence
as
well
without
knowing
this
or
caring
about
it
at
the
time
i
for
some
cause
or
other
spent
much
of
my
time
with
mas
daniel
in
preference
to
spending
it
with
most
of
the
other
boys
mas
daniel
was
the
youngest
son
of
lloyd
his
older
brothers
were
edward
and
murray
both
grown
up
and
fine
looking
men
edward
was
especially
esteemed
by
the
children
and
by
me
among
the
rest
not
that
he
ever
said
anything
to
us
or
for
us
which
could
be
called
especially
kind
it
was
enough
for
us
that
he
never
looked
nor
acted
scornfully
toward
us
there
were
also
three
sisters
all
married
one
to
edward
winder
a
second
to
edward
nicholson
a
third
to
lownes
the

of

capt
anthony
was
not
considered
a
rich
slaveholder
but
was
pretty
well
off
in
the
world
he
owned
about
thirty
head
of
slaves
and
three
farms
in
tuckahoe
the
most
valuable
part
of
his
property
was
his
slaves
of
whom
he
could
afford
to
sell
one
every
year
this
crop
therefore
brought
him
seven
or
eight
hundred
dollars
a
year
besides
his
yearly
salary
and
other
revenue
from
his
farms
the
idea
of
rank
and
station
was
rigidly
maintained
on
lloyd
s
plantation
our
family
never
visited
the
great
house
and
the
lloyds
never
came
to
our
home
equal

capt
anthony
s
family
and

of

the

such
kind
reader
was
the
community
and
such
the
place
in
which
my
earliest
and
most
lasting
impressions
of
slavery
and
of
were
received
of
which
impressions
you
will
learn
more
in
the
coming
chapters
of
this
book
chapter
initiation
to
the
mysteries
of

apparent

old
master
a
man
of
trouble
custom
of
muttering
to
himself
necessity
of
being
aware
of
his
words
the
supposed
obtuseness
of
brutal
outrage
drunken
overseer
slaveholder
s
impatience
wisdom
of
appealing
to
superiors
the
slaveholder
s
wrath
bad
as
that
of
the
overseer
a
base
and
selfish
attempt
to
break
up
a
courtship
a
harrowing
scene
although
my
old
master
capt
anthony
gave
me
at
first
as
the
reader
will
have
already
seen
very
little
attention
and
although
that
little
was
of
a
remarkably
mild
and
gentle
description
a
few
months
only
were
sufficient
to
convince
me
that
mildness
and
gentleness
were
not
the
prevailing
or
governing
traits
of
his
character
these
excellent
qualities
were
displayed
only
occasionally
he
could
when
it
suited
him
appear
to
be
literally
insensible
to
the
claims
of
humanity
when
appealed
to
by
the
helpless
against
an
aggressor
and
he
could
himself
commit
outrages
deep
dark
and
nameless
yet
he
was
not
by
nature
worse
than
other
men
had
he
been
brought
up
in
a
free
state
surrounded
by
the
just
restraints
of
free
society
restraints
which
are
necessary
to
the
freedom
of
all
its
members
alike
and
equally
capt
anthony
might
have
been
as
humane
a
man
and
every
way
as
respectable
as
many
who
now
oppose
the
slave
system
certainly
as
humane
and
respectable
as
are
members
of
society
generally
the
slaveholder
as
well
as
the
slave
is
the
victim
of
the
slave
system
a
man
s
character
greatly
takes
its
hue
and
shape
from
the
form
and
color
of
things
about
him
under
the
whole
heavens
there
is
no
relation
more
unfavorable
to
the
development
of
honorable
character
than
that
sustained
by
the
slaveholder
to
the
slave
reason
is
imprisoned
here
and
passions
run
wild
like
the
fires
of
the
prairie
once
lighted
they
are
at
the
mercy
of
every
wind
and
must
burn
till
they
have
consumed
all
that
is
combustible
within
their
remorseless
grasp
capt
anthony
could
be
kind
and
at
times
he
even
showed
an
affectionate
disposition
could
the
reader
have
seen
him
gently
leading
me
by
the
hand
as
he
sometimes
did
patting
me
on
the
head
speaking
to
me
in
soft
caressing
tones
and
calling
me
his
little
indian
boy
he
would
have
deemed
him
a
kind
old
man
and
really
almost
fatherly
but
the
pleasant
moods
of
a
slaveholder
are
remarkably
brittle
they
are
easily
snapped
they
neither
come
often
nor
remain
long
his
temper
is
subjected
to
perpetual
trials
but
since
these
trials
are
never
borne
patiently
they
add
nothing
to
his
natural
stock
of
patience
old
master
very
early
impressed
me
with
the
idea
that
he
was
an
unhappy
man
even
to
my
child
s
eye
he
wore
a
troubled
and
at
times
a
haggard
aspect
his
strange
movements
excited
my
curiosity
and
awakened
my
compassion
he
seldom
walked
alone
without
muttering
to
himself
and
he
occasionally
stormed
about
as
if
defying
an
army
of
invisible
foes
he
would
do
this
that
and
the
other
he
d
be
d
d
if
he
did
not
was
the
usual
form
of
his
threats
most
of
his
leisure
was
spent
in
walking
cursing
and
gesticulating
like
one
possessed
by
a
demon
most
evidently
he
was
a
wretched
man
at
war
with
his
own
soul
and
with
all
the
world
around
him
to
be
overheard
by
the
children
disturbed
him
very
little
he
made
no
more
of
our
presence
than
of
that
of
the
ducks
and
geese
which
he
met
on
the
green
he
little
thought
that
the
little
black
urchins
around
him
could
see
through
those
vocal
crevices
the
very
secrets
of
his
heart
slaveholders
ever
underrate
the
intelligence
with
which
supposed
obtuseness
of
they
have
to
grapple
i
really
understood
the
old
man
s
mutterings
attitudes
and
gestures
about
as
well
as
he
did
himself
but
slaveholders
never
encourage
that
kind
of
communication
with
the
slaves
by
which
they
might
learn
to
measure
the
depths
of
his
knowledge
ignorance
is
a
high
virtue
in
a
human
chattel
and
as
the
master
studies
to
keep
the
slave
ignorant
the
slave
is
cunning
enough
to
make
the
master
think
he
succeeds
the
slave
fully
appreciates
the
saying
where
ignorance
is
bliss
tis
folly
to
be
when
old
master
s
gestures
were
violent
ending
with
a
threatening
shake
of
the
head
and
a
sharp
snap
of
his
middle
finger
and
thumb
i
deemed
it
wise
to
keep
at
a
respectable
distance
from
him
for
at
such
times
trifling
faults
stood
in
his
eyes
as
momentous
offenses
and
having
both
the
power
and
the
disposition
the
victim
had
only
to
be
near
him
to
catch
the
punishment
deserved
or
undeserved
one
of
the
first
circumstances
that
opened
my
eyes
to
the
cruelty
and
wickedness
of
slavery
and
the
heartlessness
of
my
old
master
was
the
refusal
of
the
latter
to
interpose
his
authority
to
protect
and
shield
a
young
woman
who
had
been
most
cruelly
abused
and
beaten
by
his
overseer
in
tuckahoe
this
overseer
a
plummer
was
a
man
like
most
of
his
class
little
better
than
a
human
brute
and
in
addition
to
his
general
profligacy
and
repulsive
coarseness
the
creature
was
a
miserable
drunkard
he
was
probably
employed
by
my
old
master
less
on
account
of
the
excellence
of
his
services
than
for
the
cheap
rate
at
which
they
could
be
obtained
he
was
not
fit
to
have
the
management
of
a
drove
of
mules
in
a
fit
of
drunken
madness
he
committed
the
outrage
which
brought
the
young
woman
in
question
down
to
my
old
master
s
for
protection
this
young
woman
was
the
daughter
of
milly
an
own
aunt
of
mine
the
poor
girl
on
arriving
at
our
house
presented
a
pitiable
appearance
she
had
left
in
haste
and
without
preparation
and
probably
without
the
knowledge
of
plummer
she
had
traveled
twelve
miles
and
her
neck
and
shoulders
were
covered
with
scars
newly
made
and
not
content
with
marring
her
neck
and
shoulders
with
the
cowhide
the
cowardly
brute
had
dealt
her
a
blow
on
the
head
with
a
hickory
club
which
cut
a
horrible
gash
and
left
her
face
literally
covered
with
blood
in
this
condition
the
poor
young
woman
came
down
to
implore
protection
at
the
hands
of
my
old
master
i
expected
to
see
him
boil
over
with
rage
at
the
revolting
deed
and
to
hear
him
fill
the
air
with
curses
upon
the
brutual
plummer
but
i
was
disappointed
he
sternly
told
her
in
an
angry
tone
he
believed
she
deserved
every
bit
of
it
and
if
she
did
not
go
home
instantly
he
would
himself
take
the
remaining
skin
from
her
neck
and
back
thus
was
the
poor
girl
compelled
to
return
without
redress
and
perhaps
to
receive
an
additional
flogging
for
daring
to
appeal
to
old
master
against
the
overseer
old
master
seemed
furious
at
the
thought
of
being
troubled
by
such
complaints
i
did
not
at
that
time
understand
the
philosophy
of
his
treatment
of
my
cousin
it
was
stern
unnatural
violent
had
the
man
no
bowels
of
compassion
was
he
dead
to
all
sense
of
humanity
no
i
think
i
now
understand
it
this
treatment
is
a
part
of
the
system
rather
than
a
part
of
the
man
were
slaveholders
to
listen
to
complaints
of
this
sort
against
the
overseers
the
luxury
of
owning
large
numbers
of
slaves
would
be
impossible
it
would
do
away
with
the
office
of
overseer
entirely
or
in
other
words
it
would
convert
the
master
himself
into
an
overseer
it
would
occasion
great
loss
of
time
and
labor
leaving
the
overseer
in
fetters
and
without
the
necessary
power
to
secure
obedience
to
his
orders
a
privilege
so
dangerous
as
that
of
appeal
is
therefore
strictly
prohibited
and
any
one
exercising
it
runs
a
fearful
hazard
nevertheless
when
a
slave
has
nerve
enough
to
exercise
it
and
boldly
approaches
his
master
with
a
complaint
against
an
overseer
though
he
may
be
repulsed
and
may
even
have
that
of
which
he
complains
repeated
at
the
time
and
though
he
may
be
beaten
by
his
master
as
well
as
by
the
overseer
for
his
temerity
in
the
end
the
policy
of
complaining
is
generally
vindicated
by
the
relaxed
rigor
of
the
overseer
s
treatment
the
latter
becomes
more
careful
and
less
disposed
to
use
the
lash
upon
such
slaves
thereafter
it
is
with
this
final
result
in
view
rather
than
with
any
expectation
of
immediate
good
that
the
outraged
slave
is
induced
to
meet
his
master
with
a
complaint
the
overseer
very
naturally
dislikes
to
have
the
ear
of
the
master
disturbed
by
complaints
and
either
upon
this
consideration
or
upon
advice
and
warning
privately
given
him
by
his
employers
he
generally
modifies
the
rigor
of
his
rule
after
an
outbreak
of
the
kind
to
which
i
have
been
referring
howsoever
the
slaveholder
may
allow
himself
to
act
toward
his
slave
and
whatever
cruelty
he
may
deem
it
wise
for
example
s
sake
or
for
the
gratification
of
his
humor
to
inflict
he
can
not
in
the
absence
of
all
provocation
look
with
pleasure
upon
the
bleeding
wounds
of
a
defenseless
when
he
drives
her
from
his
presence
without
redress
or
the
hope
of
redress
he
acts
generally
from
motives
of
policy
rather
than
from
a
hardened
nature
or
from
innate
brutality
yet
let
but
his
own
temper
be
stirred
his
own
passions
get
loose
and
the
will
go
the
overseer
in
cruelty
he
will
convince
the
slave
that
his
wrath
is
far
more
terrible
and
boundless
and
vastly
more
to
be
dreaded
than
that
of
the
underling
overseer
what
may
have
been
mechanically
and
heartlessly
done
by
the
overseer
is
now
done
with
a
will
the
man
who
now
wields
the
lash
is
irresponsible
he
may
if
he
pleases
cripple
or
kill
without
fear
of
consequences
except
in
so
far
as
it
may
concern
profit
or
loss
to
a
man
of
violent
temper
as
my
old
master
was
this
was
but
a
very
slender
and
inefficient
restraint
i
have
seen
him
in
a
tempest
of
passion
such
as
i
have
just
described
a
passion
into
which
entered
all
the
bitter
ingredients
of
pride
hatred
envy
jealousy
and
the
thrist
sic
for
revenge
the
circumstances
which
i
am
about
to
narrate
and
which
gave
rise
to
this
fearful
tempest
of
passion
are
not
singular
nor
isolated
in
slave
life
but
are
common
in
every
slaveholding
community
in
which
i
have
lived
they
are
incidental
to
the
relation
of
master
and
slave
and
exist
in
all
sections
of
countries
the
reader
will
have
noticed
that
in
enumerating
the
names
of
the
slaves
who
lived
with
my
old
master
is
mentioned
this
was
a
young
woman
who
possessed
that
which
is
ever
a
curse
to
the
namely
personal
beauty
she
was
tall
well
formed
and
made
a
fine
appearance
the
daughters
of
lloyd
could
scarcely
surpass
her
in
personal
charms
esther
was
courted
by
ned
roberts
and
he
was
as
fine
looking
a
young
man
as
she
was
a
woman
he
was
the
son
of
a
favorite
slave
of
lloyd
some
slaveholders
would
have
been
glad
to
promote
the
marriage
of
two
such
persons
but
for
some
reason
or
other
my
old
master
took
it
upon
him
to
break
up
the
growing
intimacy
between
esther
and
edward
he
strictly
ordered
her
to
quit
the
company
of
said
roberts
telling
her
that
he
would
punish
her
severely
if
he
ever
found
her
again
in
edward
s
company
this
unnatural
and
heartless
order
was
of
course
broken
a
woman
s
love
is
not
to
be
annihilated
by
the
peremptory
command
of
any
one
whose
breath
is
in
his
nostrils
it
was
impossible
to
keep
edward
and
esther
apart
meet
they
would
and
meet
they
did
had
old
master
been
a
man
of
honor
and
purity
his
motives
in
this
matter
might
have
been
viewed
more
favorably
as
it
was
his
motives
were
as
abhorrent
as
his
methods
were
foolish
and
contemptible
it
was
too
evident
that
he
was
not
concerned
for
the
girl
s
welfare
it
is
one
of
the
damning
characteristics
of
the
slave
system
that
it
robs
its
victims
of
every
earthly
incentive
to
a
holy
life
the
fear
of
god
and

is
at

here
except
in

as
are
purer
and
higher
than
the
standard
morality
around

it
is
one
of
the
consolations
of
my
life
that
i
know
of
many
honorable
instances
of
persons
who
maintained
their
honor
where
all
around
was
corrupt
esther
was
evidently
much
attached
to
edward
and
abhorred
as
she
had
reason
to
do
the
tyrannical
and
base
behavior
of
old
master
edward
was
young
and
fine
looking
and
he
loved
and
courted
her
he
might
have
been
her
husband
in
the
high
sense
just
alluded
to
but
who
and
was
this
old
master
his
attentions
were
plainly
brutal
and
selfish
and
it
was
as
natural
that
esther
should
loathe
him
as
that
she
should
love
edward
abhorred
and
circumvented
as
he
was
old
master
having
the
power
very
easily
took
revenge
i
happened
to
see
this
exhibition
of
his
rage
and
cruelty
toward
esther
the
time
selected
was
singular
it
was
early
in
the
morning
when
all
besides
was
still
and
before
any
of
the
family
in
the
house
or
kitchen
had
left
their
beds
i
saw
but
few
of
the
shocking
preliminaries
for
the
cruel
work
had
begun
before
i
awoke
i
was
probably
awakened
by
the
shrieks
and
piteous
cries
of
poor
esther
my
sleeping
place
was
on
the
floor
of
a
little
rough
closet
which
opened
into
the
kitchen
and
through
the
cracks
of
its
unplaned
boards
i
could
distinctly
see
and
hear
what
was
going
on
without
being
seen
by
old
master
esther
s
wrists
were
firmly
tied
and
the
twisted
rope
was
fastened
to
a
strong
staple
in
a
heavy
wooden
joist
above
near
the
fireplace
here
she
stood
on
a
bench
her
arms
tightly
drawn
over
her
breast
her
back
and
shoulders
were
bare
to
the
waist
behind
her
stood
old
master
with
cowskin
in
hand
preparing
his
barbarous
work
with
all
manner
of
harsh
coarse
and
tantalizing
epithets
the
screams
of
his
victim
were
most
piercing
he
was
cruelly
deliberate
and
protracted
the
torture
as
one
who
was
delighted
with
the
scene
again
and
again
he
drew
the
hateful
whip
through
his
hand
adjusting
it
with
a
view
of
dealing
the
most
blow
poor
esther
had
never
yet
been
severely
whipped
and
her
shoulders
were
plump
and
tender
each
blow
vigorously
laid
on
brought
screams
as
well
as
blood
have
mercy
oh
have
mercy
she
cried
won
t
do
so
no
more
but
her
piercing
cries
seemed
only
to
increase
his
fury
his
answers
to
them
are
too
coarse
and
blasphemous
to
be
produced
here
the
whole
scene
with
all
its
attendants
was
revolting
and
shocking
to
the
last
degree
and
when
the
motives
of
this
brutal
castigation
are
considered
language
has
no
power
to
convey
a
just
sense
of
its
awful
criminality
after
laying
on
some
thirty
or
forty
stripes
old
master
untied
his
suffering
victim
and
let
her
get
down
she
could
scarcely
stand
when
untied
from
my
heart
i
pitied
her
and
child
though
i
was
the
outrage
kindled
in
me
a
feeling
far
from
peaceful
but
i
was
hushed
terrified
stunned
and
could
do
nothing
and
the
fate
of
esther
might
be
mine
next
the
scene
here
described
was
often
repeated
in
the
case
of
poor
esther
and
her
life
as
i
knew
it
was
one
of
wretchedness

the
contrast
the
incidents
related
in
the
foregoing
chapter
led
me
thus
early
to
inquire
into
the
nature
and
history
of
slavery
am
i
a
slave
why
are
some
people
slaves
and
others
masters
was
there
ever
a
time
this
was
not
so
how
did
the
relation
commence
these
were
the
perplexing
questions
which
began
now
to
claim
my
thoughts
and
to
exercise
the
weak
powers
of
my
mind
for
i
was
still
but
a
child
and
knew
less
than
children
of
the
same
age
in
the
free
states
as
my
questions
concerning
these
things
were
only
put
to
children
a
little
older
and
little
better
informed
than
myself
i
was
not
rapid
in
reaching
a
solid
footing
by
some
means
i
learned
from
these
inquiries
that
god
up
in
the
sky
made
every
body
and
that
he
made
people
to
be
masters
and
mistresses
and
people
to
be
slaves
this
did
not
satisfy
me
nor
lessen
my
interest
in
the
subject
i
was
told
too
that
god
was
good
and
that
he
knew
what
was
best
for
me
and
best
for
everybody
this
was
less
satisfactory
than
the
first
statement
because
it
came
point
blank
against
all
my
notions
of
goodness
it
was
not
good
to
let
old
master
cut
the
flesh
off
esther
and
make
her
cry
so
besides
how
did
people
know
that
god
made
black
people
to
be
slaves
did
they
go
up
in
the
sky
and
learn
it
or
did
he
come
down
and
tell
them
so
all
was
dark
here
it
was
some
relief
to
my
hard
notions
of
the
goodness
of
god
that
although
he
made
white
men
to
be
slaveholders
he
did
not
make
them
to
be
slaveholders
and
that
in
due
time
he
would
punish
the
bad
slaveholders
that
he
would
when
they
died
send
them
to
the
bad
place
where
they
would
be
burnt
nevertheless
i
could
not
reconcile
the
relation
of
slavery
with
my
crude
notions
of
goodness
then
too
i
found
that
there
were
puzzling
exceptions
to
this
theory
of
slavery
on
both
sides
and
in
the
middle
i
knew
of
blacks
who
were
slaves
i
knew
of
whites
who
were
slaveholders
and
i
knew
of
persons
who
were
white
who
were
slaves
therefore
was
a
very
unsatisfactory
basis
for
slavery
once
however
engaged
in
the
inquiry
i
was
not
very
long
in
finding
out
the
true
solution
of
the
matter
it
was
not
but
not
but
that
afforded
the
true
explanation
of
the
existence
of
slavery
nor
was
i
long
in
finding
out
another
important
truth
viz
what
man
can
make
man
can
unmake
the
appalling
darkness
faded
away
and
i
was
master
of
the
subject
there
were
slaves
here
direct
from
guinea
and
there
were
many
who
could
say
that
their
fathers
and
mothers
were
stolen
from
africa
forced
from
their
homes
and
compelled
to
serve
as
slaves
this
to
me
was
knowledge
but
it
was
a
kind
of
knowledge
which
filled
me
with
a
burning
hatred
of
slavery
increased
my
suffering
and
left
me
without
the
means
of
breaking
away
from
my
bondage
yet
it
was
knowledge
quite
worth
possessing
i
could
not
have
been
more
than
seven
or
eight
years
old
when
i
began
to
make
this
subject
my
study
it
was
with
me
in
the
woods
and
fields
along
the
shore
of
the
river
and
wherever
my
boyish
wanderings
led
me
and
though
i
was
at
that
time
early
reflections
on
slavery
quite
ignorant
of
the
existence
of
the
free
states
i
distinctly
remember
being
most
strongly
impressed
with
the
idea
of
being
a
freeman
some
day
this
cheering
assurance
was
an
inborn
dream
of
my
human
nature
a
constant
menace
to
slavery
and
one
which
all
the
powers
of
slavery
were
unable
to
silence
or
extinguish
up
to
the
time
of
the
brutal
flogging
of
my
aunt
esther
for
she
was
my
own
aunt
and
the
horrid
plight
in
which
i
had
seen
my
cousin
from
tuckahoe
who
had
been
so
badly
beaten
by
the
cruel
plummer
my
attention
had
not
been
called
especially
to
the
gross
features
of
slavery
i
had
of
course
heard
of
whippings
and
of
savage
between
overseers
and
slaves
but
i
had
always
been
out
of
the
way
at
the
times
and
places
of
their
occurrence
my
plays
and
sports
most
of
the
time
took
me
from
the
corn
and
tobacco
fields
where
the
great
body
of
the
hands
were
at
work
and
where
scenes
of
cruelty
were
enacted
and
witnessed
but
after
the
whipping
of
aunt
esther
i
saw
many
cases
of
the
same
shocking
nature
not
only
in
my
master
s
house
but
on
lloyd
s
plantation
one
of
the
first
which
i
saw
and
which
greatly
agitated
me
was
the
whipping
of
a
woman
belonging
to
lloyd
named
nelly
the
offense
alleged
against
nelly
was
one
of
the
commonest
and
most
indefinite
in
the
whole
catalogue
of
offenses
usually
laid
to
the
charge
of
slaves
viz
this
may
mean
almost
anything
or
nothing
at
all
just
according
to
the
caprice
of
the
master
or
overseer
at
the
moment
but
whatever
it
is
or
is
not
if
it
gets
the
name
of
impudence
the
party
charged
with
it
is
sure
of
a
flogging
this
offense
may
be
committed
in
various
ways
in
the
tone
of
an
answer
in
answering
at
all
in
not
answering
in
the
expression
of
countenance
in
the
motion
of
the
head
in
the
gait
manner
and
bearing
of
the
slave
in
the
case
under
consideration
i
can
easily
believe
that
according
to
all
slaveholding
standards
here
was
a
genuine
instance
of
impudence
in
nelly
there
were
all
the
necessary
conditions
for
committing
the
offense
she
was
a
bright
mulatto
the
recognized
wife
of
a
favorite
hand
on
board
lloyd
s
sloop
and
the
mother
of
five
sprightly
children
she
was
a
vigorous
and
spirited
woman
and
one
of
the
most
likely
on
the
plantation
to
be
guilty
of
impudence
my
attention
was
called
to
the
scene
by
the
noise
curses
and
screams
that
proceeded
from
it
and
on
going
a
little
in
that
direction
i
came
upon
the
parties
engaged
in
the
skirmish
siever
the
overseer
had
hold
of
nelly
when
i
caught
sight
of
them
he
was
endeavoring
to
drag
her
toward
a
tree
which
endeavor
nelly
was
sternly
resisting
but
to
no
purpose
except
to
retard
the
progress
of
the
overseer
s
plans
nelly
as
i
have
said
was
the
mother
of
five
children
three
of
them
were
present
and
though
quite
small
from
seven
to
ten
years
old
i
should
think
they
gallantly
came
to
their
mother
s
defense
and
gave
the
overseer
an
excellent
pelting
with
stones
one
of
the
little
fellows
ran
up
seized
the
overseer
by
the
leg
and
bit
him
but
the
monster
was
too
busily
engaged
with
nelly
to
pay
any
attention
to
the
assaults
of
the
children
there
were
numerous
bloody
marks
on
sevier
s
face
when
i
first
saw
him
and
they
increased
as
the
struggle
went
on
the
imprints
of
nelly
s
fingers
were
visible
and
i
was
glad
to
see
them
amidst
the
wild
screams
of
the
children
my
mammy
go
let
my
mammy
there
escaped
from
between
the
teeth
of
the
overseer
a
few
bitter
curses
mingled
with
threats
that
he
would
teach
the
d
d
b
h
how
to
give
a
white
man
there
is
no
doubt
that
nelly
felt
herself
superior
in
some
respects
to
the
slaves
around
her
she
was
a
wife
and
a
mother
her
husband
was
a
valued
and
favorite
slave
besides
he
was
one
of
the
first
hands
on
board
of
the
sloop
and
the
sloop
hands
since
they
had
to
represent
the
plantation
abroad
were
generally
treated
tenderly
the
overseer
never
was
allowed
to
whip
harry
why
then
should
he
be
allowed
to
whip
harry
s
wife
thoughts
of
this
kind
no
doubt
influenced
her
but
for
whatever
reason
she
nobly
resisted
and
unlike
most
of
the
slaves
combat
between
sevier
and
nelly
seemed
determined
to
make
her
whipping
cost
sevier
as
much
as
possible
the
blood
on
his
and
her
face
attested
her
skill
as
well
as
her
courage
and
dexterity
in
using
her
nails
maddened
by
her
resistance
i
expected
to
see
sevier
level
her
to
the
ground
by
a
stunning
blow
but
no
like
a
savage
which
he
resembled
both
in
temper
and
appearance
he
maintained
his
grip
and
steadily
dragged
his
victim
toward
the
tree
disregarding
alike
her
blows
and
the
cries
of
the
children
for
their
mother
s
release
he
would
doubtless
have
knocked
her
down
with
his
hickory
stick
but
that
such
act
might
have
cost
him
his
place
it
is
often
deemed
advisable
to
knock
a
slave
down
in
order
to
tie
him
but
it
is
considered
cowardly
and
inexcusable
in
an
overseer
thus
to
deal
with
a
he
is
expected
to
tie
her
up
and
to
give
her
what
is
called
in
southern
parlance
a
genteel
flogging
without
any
very
great
outlay
of
strength
or
skill
i
watched
with
palpitating
interest
the
course
of
the
preliminary
struggle
and
was
saddened
by
every
new
advantage
gained
over
her
by
the
ruffian
there
were
times
when
she
seemed
likely
to
get
the
better
of
the
brute
but
he
finally
overpowered
her
and
succeeded
in
getting
his
rope
around
her
arms
and
in
firmly
tying
her
to
the
tree
at
which
he
had
been
aiming
this
done
and
nelly
was
at
the
mercy
of
his
merciless
lash
and
now
what
followed
i
have
no
heart
to
describe
the
cowardly
creature
made
good
his
every
threat
and
wielded
the
lash
with
all
the
hot
zest
of
furious
revenge
the
cries
of
the
woman
while
undergoing
the
terrible
infliction
were
mingled
with
those
of
the
children
sounds
which
i
hope
the
reader
may
never
be
called
upon
to
hear
when
nelly
was
untied
her
back
was
covered
with
blood
the
red
stripes
were
all
over
her
shoulders
she
was
whipped
severely
whipped
but
she
was
not
subdued
for
she
continued
to
denounce
the
overseer
and
to
call
him
every
vile
name
he
had
bruised
her
flesh
but
had
left
her
invincible
spirit
undaunted
such
floggings
are
seldom
repeated
by
the
same
overseer
they
prefer
to
whip
those
who
are
most
easily
whipped
the
old
doctrine
that
submission
is
the
very
best
cure
for
outrage
and
wrong
does
not
hold
good
on
the
slave
plantation
he
is
whipped
oftenest
who
is
whipped
easiest
and
that
slave
who
has
the
courage
to
stand
up
for
himself
against
the
overseer
although
he
may
have
many
hard
stripes
at
the
first
becomes
in
the
end
a
freeman
even
though
he
sustain
the
formal
relation
of
a
slave
you
can
shoot
me
but
you
can
t
whip
me
said
a
slave
to
rigby
hopkins
and
the
result
was
that
he
was
neither
whipped
nor
shot
if
the
latter
had
been
his
fate
it
would
have
been
less
deplorable
than
the
living
and
lingering
death
to
which
cowardly
and
slavish
souls
are
subjected
i
do
not
know
that
sevier
ever
undertook
to
whip
nelly
again
he
probably
never
did
for
it
was
not
long
after
his
attempt
to
subdue
her
that
he
was
taken
sick
and
died
the
wretched
man
died
as
he
had
lived
unrepentant
and
it
was
said
with
how
much
truth
i
know
not
that
in
the
very
last
hours
of
his
life
his
ruling
passion
showed
itself
and
that
when
wrestling
with
death
he
was
uttering
horrid
oaths
and
flourishing
the
cowskin
as
though
he
was
tearing
the
flesh
off
some
helpless
slave
one
thing
is
certain
that
when
he
was
in
health
it
was
enough
to
chill
the
blood
and
to
stiffen
the
hair
of
an
ordinary
man
to
hear
sevier
talk
nature
or
his
cruel
habits
had
given
to
his
face
an
expression
of
unusual
savageness
even
for
a
tobacco
and
rage
had
worn
his
teeth
short
and
nearly
every
sentence
that
escaped
their
compressed
grating
was
commenced
or
concluded
with
some
outburst
of
profanity
his
presence
made
the
field
alike
the
field
of
blood
and
of
blasphemy
hated
for
his
cruelty
despised
for
his
cowardice
his
death
was
deplored
by
no
one
outside
his
own
house
if
indeed
it
was
deplored
there
it
was
regarded
by
the
slaves
as
a
merciful
interposition
of
providence
never
went
there
a
man
to
the
grave
loaded
with
heavier
curses
sevier
s
place
was
promptly
taken
by
a
hopkins
and
the
change
was
quite
a
relief
he
being
a
very
different
man
he
was
in
all
respects
a
better
man
than
his
predecessor
as
good
as
any
man
can
be
and
yet
be
an
overseer
his
course
was
characterized
by
no
extraordinary
cruelty
and
when
he
whipped
a
slave
as
he
sometimes
did
he
seemed
to
take
no
especial
pleasure
in
it
but
on
the
contrary
acted
as
though
he
felt
it
to
be
a
mean
business
hopkins
stayed
but
a
short
time
his
place
much
to
the
regret
of
the
slaves
generally
was
taken
by
a
gore
of
whom
more
will
be
said
hereafter
it
is
enough
for
the
present
to
say
that
he
was
no
improvement
on
sevier
except
that
he
was
less
noisy
and
less
profane
i
have
already
referred
to
the
aspect
of
lloyd
s
plantation
this
appearance
was
much
increased
on
the
two
days
at
the
end
of
each
month
when
the
slaves
from
the
different
farms
came
to
get
their
monthly
allowance
of
meal
and
meat
these
were
gala
days
for
the
slaves
and
there
was
much
rivalry
among
them
as
to
should
be
elected
to
go
up
to
the
great
house
farm
for
the
allowance
and
indeed
to
attend
to
any
business
at
this
for
them
the
capital
the
beauty
and
grandeur
of
the
place
its
numerous
slave
population
and
the
fact
that
harry
peter
and
jake
the
sailors
of
the
sloop
almost
always
kept
privately
little
trinkets
which
they
bought
at
baltimore
to
sell
made
it
a
privilege
to
come
to
the
great
house
farm
being
selected
too
for
this
office
was
deemed
a
high
honor
it
was
taken
as
a
proof
of
confidence
and
favor
but
probably
the
chief
motive
of
the
competitors
for
the
place
was
a
desire
to
break
the
dull
monotony
of
the
field
and
to
get
beyond
the
overseer
s
eye
and
lash
once
on
the
road
with
an
ox
team
and
seated
on
the
tongue
of
his
cart
with
no
overseer
to
look
after
him
the
slave
was
comparatively
free
and
if
thoughtful
he
had
time
to
think
slaves
are
generally
expected
to
sing
as
well
as
to
work
a
silent
slave
is
not
liked
by
masters
or
overseers
make
a
noise
make
a
noise
and
bear
a
hand
are
the
words
usually
addressed
to
the
slaves
when
there
is
silence
amongst
them
this
may
account
for
the
almost
constant
singing
heard
in
the
southern
states
there
was
generally
more
or
less
singing
among
the
teamsters
as
it
was
one
means
of
letting
the
overseer
know
where
they
were
and
that
they
were
moving
on
with
the
work
but
on
allowance
day
those
who
visited
the
great
house
farm
were
peculiarly
excited
and
noisy
while
on
their
way
they
would
make
the
dense
old
woods
for
miles
around
reverberate
with
their
wild
notes
these
were
not
always
merry
because
they
were
wild
on
the
contrary
they
were
mostly
of
a
plaintive
cast
and
told
a
tale
of
grief
and
sorrow
in
the
most
boisterous
outbursts
of
rapturous
sentiment
there
was
ever
a
tinge
of
deep
melancholy
i
have
never
heard
any
songs
like
those
anywhere
since
i
left
slavery
except
when
in
ireland
there
i
heard
the
same
and
was
much
affected
by
them
it
was
during
the
famine
of
in
all
the
songs
of
the
slaves
there
was
ever
some
expression
in
praise
of
the
great
house
farm
something
which
would
flatter
the
pride
of
the
owner
and
possibly
draw
a
favorable
glance
from
him
am
going
away
to
the
great
house
farm
o
yea
o
yea
o
yea
my
old
master
is
a
good
old
master
o
yea
o
yea
o
yea
this
they
would
sing
with
other
words
of
their
own
improvising
jargon
to
others
but
full
of
meaning
to
themselves
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
the
mere
hearing
of
those
songs
would
do
more
to
impress
truly
men
and
women
with
the
and
character
of
slavery
than
the
reading
of
whole
volumes
of
its
mere
physical
cruelties
they
speak
to
the
heart
and
to
the
soul
of
the
thoughtful
i
can
not
better
express
my
sense
of
them
now
than
ten
years
ago
when
in
sketching
my
life
i
thus
spoke
of
this
feature
of
my
plantation
experience
i
did
not
when
a
slave
understand
the
deep
meanings
of
those
rude
and
apparently
incoherent
songs
i
was
myself
within
the
circle
so
that
i
neither
saw
or
heard
as
those
without
might
see
and
hear
they
told
a
tale
which
was
then
altogether
beyond
my
feeble
comprehension
they
were
tones
loud
long
and
deep
breathing
the
prayer
and
complaint
of
souls
boiling
over
with
the
bitterest
anguish
every
tone
was
a
testimony
against
slavery
and
a
prayer
to
god
for
deliverance
from
chains
the
hearing
of
those
wild
notes
always
depressed
my
spirits
and
filled
my
heart
with
ineffable
sadness
the
mere
recurrence
even
now
afflicts
my
spirit
and
while
i
am
writing
these
lines
my
tears
are
falling
to
those
songs
i
trace
my
first
glimmering
conceptions
of
the
dehumanizing
character
of
slavery
i
can
never
get
rid
of
that
conception
those
songs
still
follow
me
to
deepen
my
hatred
of
slavery
and
quicken
my
sympathies
for
my
brethren
in
bonds
if
any
one
wishes
to
be
impressed
with
a
sense
of
the
power
of
slavery
let
him
go
to
lloyd
s
plantation
and
on
allowance
day
place
himself
in
the
deep
pine
woods
and
there
let
him
in
silence
thoughtfully
analyze
the
sounds
that
shall
pass
through
the
chambers
of
his
soul
and
if
he
is
not
thus
impressed
it
will
only
be
because
there
is
no
flesh
in
his
obdurate
the
remark
is
not
unfrequently
made
that
slaves
are
the
most
contended
and
happy
laborers
in
the
world
they
dance
and
sing
and
make
all
manner
of
joyful
noises
so
they
do
but
it
is
a
great
mistake
to
suppose
them
happy
because
they
sing
the
songs
of
the
slave
represent
the
sorrows
rather
than
the
joys
of
his
heart
and
he
is
relieved
by
them
only
as
an
aching
heart
is
relieved
by
its
tears
such
is
the
constitution
of
the
human
mind
that
when
pressed
to
extremes
it
often
avails
itself
of
the
most
opposite
methods
extremes
meet
in
mind
as
in
matter
when
the
slaves
on
board
of
the
pearl
were
overtaken
arrested
and
carried
to
prison
their
hopes
for
freedom
blasted
as
they
marched
in
chains
they
sang
and
found
as
emily
edmunson
tells
us
a
melancholy
relief
in
singing
the
singing
of
a
man
cast
away
on
a
desolate
island
might
be
as
appropriately
considered
an
evidence
of
his
contentment
and
happiness
as
the
singing
of
a
slave
sorrow
and
desolation
have
their
songs
as
well
as
joy
and
peace
slaves
sing
more
to
themselves
happy
than
to
express
their
happiness
it
is
the
boast
of
slaveholders
that
their
slaves
enjoy
more
of
the
physical
comforts
of
life
than
the
peasantry
of
any
country
in
the
world
my
experience
contradicts
this
the
men
and
the
women
slaves
on
lloyd
s
farm
received
as
their
monthly
allowance
of
food
eight
pounds
of
pickled
pork
or
their
equivalent
in
fish
the
pork
was
often
tainted
and
the
fish
was
of
the
poorest
quality
herrings
which
would
bring
very
little
if
offered
for
sale
in
any
northern
market
with
their
pork
or
fish
they
had
one
bushel
of
indian
meal
unbolted
of
which
quite
fifteen
per
cent
was
fit
only
to
feed
pigs
with
this
one
pint
of
salt
was
given
and
this
was
the
entire
monthly
allowance
of
a
full
grown
slave
working
constantly
in
the
open
field
from
morning
until
night
every
day
in
the
month
except
sunday
and
living
on
a
fraction
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
pound
of
meat
per
day
and
less
than
a
peck
of
per
week
there
is
no
kind
of
work
that
a
man
can
do
which
requires
a
better
supply
of
food
to
prevent
physical
exhaustion
than
the
of
a
slave
so
much
for
the
slave
s
allowance
of
food
now
for
his
raiment
the
yearly
allowance
of
clothing
for
the
slaves
on
this
plantation
consisted
of
two
shirts
such
linen
as
the
coarsest
crash
towels
are
made
of
one
pair
of
trowsers
of
the
same
material
for
summer
and
a
pair
of
trowsers
and
a
jacket
of
woolen
most
slazily
put
together
for
winter
one
pair
of
yarn
stockings
and
one
pair
of
shoes
of
the
coarsest
description
the
slave
s
entire
apparel
could
not
have
cost
more
than
eight
dollars
per
year
the
allowance
of
food
and
clothing
for
the
little
children
was
committed
to
their
mothers
or
to
the
older
slavewomen
having
the
care
of
them
children
who
were
unable
to
work
in
the
field
had
neither
shoes
stockings
jackets
nor
trowsers
given
them
their
clothing
consisted
of
two
coarse
shirts
already
described
per
year
and
when
these
failed
them
as
they
often
did
they
went
naked
until
the
next
allowance
day
flocks
of
little
children
from
five
to
ten
years
old
might
be
seen
on
lloyd
s
plantation
as
destitute
of
clothing
as
any
little
heathen
on
the
west
coast
of
africa
and
this
not
merely
during
the
summer
months
but
during
the
frosty
weather
of
march
the
little
girls
were
no
better
off
than
the
boys
all
were
nearly
in
a
state
of
nudity
as
to
beds
to
sleep
on
they
were
known
to
none
of
the
field
hands
nothing
but
a
coarse
blanket
not
so
good
as
those
used
in
the
north
to
cover
horses
was
given
them
and
this
only
to
the
men
and
women
the
children
stuck
themselves
in
holes
and
corners
about
the
quarters
often
in
the
corner
of
the
huge
chimneys
with
their
feet
in
the
ashes
to
keep
them
warm
the
want
of
beds
however
was
not
considered
a
very
great
privation
time
to
sleep
was
of
far
greater
importance
for
when
the
day
s
work
is
done
most
of
the
slaves
have
their
washing
mending
and
cooking
to
do
and
having
few
or
none
of
the
ordinary
facilities
for
doing
such
things
very
many
of
their
sleeping
hours
are
consumed
in
necessary
preparations
for
the
duties
of
the
coming
day
the
sleeping
apartments
if
they
may
be
called
such
have
little
regard
to
comfort
or
decency
old
and
young
male
and
female
married
and
single
drop
down
upon
the
common
clay
floor
each
covering
up
with
his
or
her
blanket
the
only
protection
they
have
from
cold
or
exposure
the
night
however
is
shortened
at
both
ends
the
slaves
work
often
as
long
as
they
can
see
and
are
late
in
cooking
and
mending
for
the
coming
day
and
at
the
first
gray
streak
of
morning
they
are
summoned
to
the
field
by
the
driver
s
horn
more
slaves
are
whipped
for
oversleeping
than
for
any
other
fault
neither
age
nor
sex
finds
any
favor
the
overseer
stands
at
the
quarter
door
armed
with
stick
and
cowskin
ready
to
whip
any
who
may
be
a
few
minutes
behind
time
when
the
horn
is
blown
there
is
a
rush
for
the
door
and
the
hindermost
one
is
sure
to
get
a
blow
from
the
overseer
young
mothers
who
worked
in
the
field
were
allowed
an
hour
about
ten
o
clock
in
the
morning
to
go
home
to
nurse
their
children
sometimes
they
were
compelled
to
take
their
children
with
them
and
to
leave
them
in
the
corner
of
the
fences
to
prevent
loss
of
time
in
nursing
them
the
overseer
generally
rides
about
the
field
on
horseback
a
cowskin
and
a
hickory
stick
are
his
constant
companions
the
cowskin
is
a
kind
of
whip
seldom
seen
in
the
northern
states
it
is
made
entirely
of
untanned
but
dried
ox
hide
and
is
about
as
hard
as
a
piece
of
live
oak
it
is
made
of
various
sizes
but
the
usual
length
is
about
three
feet
the
part
held
in
the
hand
is
nearly
an
inch
in
thickness
and
from
the
extreme
end
of
the
butt
or
handle
the
cowskin
tapers
its
whole
length
to
a
point
this
makes
it
quite
elastic
and
springy
a
blow
with
it
on
the
hardest
back
will
gash
the
flesh
and
make
the
blood
start
cowskins
are
painted
red
blue
and
green
and
are
the
favorite
slave
whip
i
think
this
whip
worse
than
the
it
condenses
the
whole
strength
of
the
arm
to
a
single
point
and
comes
with
a
spring
that
makes
the
air
whistle
it
is
a
terrible
instrument
and
is
so
handy
that
the
overseer
can
always
have
it
on
his
person
and
ready
for
use
the
temptation
to
use
it
is
ever
strong
and
an
overseer
can
if
disposed
always
have
cause
for
using
it
with
him
it
is
literally
a
word
and
a
blow
and
in
most
cases
the
blow
comes
first
as
a
general
rule
slaves
do
not
come
to
the
quarters
for
either
breakfast
or
dinner
but
take
their
ash
cake
with
them
and
eat
it
in
the
field
this
was
so
on
the
home
plantation
probably
because
the
distance
from
the
quarter
to
the
field
was
sometimes
two
and
even
three
miles
the
dinner
of
the
slaves
consisted
of
a
huge
piece
of
ash
cake
and
a
small
piece
of
pork
or
two
salt
herrings
not
having
ovens
nor
any
suitable
cooking
utensils
the
slaves
mixed
their
meal
with
a
little
water
to
such
thickness
that
a
spoon
would
stand
erect
in
it
and
after
the
wood
had
burned
away
to
coals
and
ashes
they
would
place
the
dough
between
oak
leaves
and
lay
it
carefully
in
the
ashes
completely
covering
it
hence
the
bread
is
called
ash
cake
the
surface
of
this
peculiar
bread
is
covered
with
ashes
to
the
depth
of
a
sixteenth
part
of
an
inch
and
the
ashes
certainly
do
not
make
it
very
grateful
to
the
teeth
nor
render
it
very
palatable
the
bran
or
coarse
part
of
the
meal
is
baked
with
the
fine
and
bright
scales
run
through
the
bread
this
bread
with
its
ashes
and
bran
would
disgust
and
choke
a
northern
man
but
it
is
quite
liked
by
the
slaves
they
eat
it
with
avidity
and
are
more
concerned
about
the
quantity
than
about
the
quality
they
are
far
too
scantily
provided
for
and
are
worked
too
steadily
to
be
much
concerned
for
the
quality
of
their
food
the
few
minutes
allowed
them
at
dinner
time
after
partaking
of
their
coarse
repast
are
variously
spent
some
lie
down
on
the
turning
row
and
go
to
sleep
others
draw
together
and
talk
and
others
are
at
work
with
needle
and
thread
mending
their
tattered
garments
sometimes
you
may
hear
a
wild
hoarse
laugh
arise
from
a
circle
and
often
a
song
soon
however
the
overseer
comes
dashing
through
the
field
tumble
up
tumble
and
to
work
is
the
cry
and
now
from
twelve
o
clock
till
dark
the
human
cattle
are
in
motion
wielding
their
clumsy
hoes
hurried
on
by
no
hope
of
reward
no
sense
of
gratitude
no
love
of
children
no
prospect
of
bettering
their
condition
nothing
save
the
dread
and
terror
of
the
s
lash
so
goes
one
day
and
so
comes
and
goes
another
but
let
us
now
leave
the
rough
usage
of
the
field
where
vulgar
coarseness
and
brutal
cruelty
spread
themselves
and
flourish
rank
as
weeds
in
the
tropics
where
a
vile
wretch
in
the
shape
of
a
man
rides
walks
or
struts
about
dealing
blows
and

and
disgraceful
that
rather
than
engage
in
it
a
decent
man
would
blow
his
own

out
and
let
the
reader
view
with
me
the
equally
wicked
but
less
repulsive
aspects
of
slave
life
where
pride
and
pomp
roll
luxuriously
at
ease
where
the
toil
of
a
thousand
men
supports
a
single
family
in
easy
idleness
and
sin
this
is
the
great
house
it
is
the
home
of
the
lloyds
some
idea
of
its
splendor
has
already
been
given
and
it
is
here
that
we
shall
find
that
height
of
luxury
which
is
the
opposite
of
that
depth
of
poverty
and
physical
wretchedness
that
we
have
just
now
been
contemplating
but
there
is
this
difference
in
the
two
extremes
viz
that
in
the
case
of
the
slave
the
miseries
and
hardships
of
his
lot
are
imposed
by
others
and
in
the
master
s
case
they
are
imposed
by
himself
the
slave
is
a
subject
subjected
by
others
the
slaveholder
is
a
subject
but
he
is
the
author
of
his
own
subjection
there
is
more
truth
in
the
saying
that
slavery
is
a
greater
evil
to
the
master
than
to
the
slave
than
many
who
utter
it
suppose
the
laws
of
eternal
justice
follow
close
on
the
heels
of
the
here
as
well
as
elsewhere
making
escape
from
all
its
penalties
impossible
but
let
others
philosophize
it
is
my
province
here
to
relate
and
describe
only

myself

two

these
servants
constituted
a
sort
of
black
aristocracy
on
lloyd
s
plantation
they
resembled
the
field
hands
in
nothing
except
in
color
and
in
this
they
held
the
advantage
of
a
glossiness
rich
and
beautiful
the
hair
too
showed
the
same
advantage
the
delicate
colored
maid
rustled
in
the
scarcely
worn
silk
of
her
young
mistress
while
the
servant
men
were
equally
well
attired
from
the

of

young
masters
so
that
in
dress
as
well
as
in
form
and
feature
in
manner
and
speech
in
tastes
and
habits
the
distance
between
these
favored
few
and
the
sorrow
and
multitudes
of
the
quarter
and
the
field
was
immense
and
this
is
seldom
passed
over
let
us
now
glance
at
the
stables
and
the
carriage
house
and
we
shall
find
the
same
evidences
of
pride
and
luxurious
extravagance
here
are
three
splendid
coaches
soft
within
and
lustrous
without
here
too
are
gigs
phaetons
barouches
sulkeys
and
sleighs
here
are
saddles
and
harnesses
beautifully
wrought
and
silver
mounted
kept
with
every
care
in
the
stable
you
will
find
kept
only
for
pleasure
full
horses
of
the
most
approved
blood
for
speed
and
beauty
there
are
two
men
here
constantly
employed
in
taking
care
of
these
horses
one
of
these
men
must
be
always
in
the
stable
to
answer
every
call
from
the
great
house
over
the
way
from
the
stable
is
a
house
built
expressly
for
the
hounds
a
pack
of
or
thirty
whose
fare
would
have
made
glad
the
heart
of
a
dozen
slaves
horses
and
hounds
are
not
the
only
consumers
of
the
slave
s
toil
there
was
practiced
at
the
lloyd
s
a
hospitality
which
would
have
astonished
and
charmed
any
northern
divine
or
merchant
who
might
have
chanced
to
share
it
viewed
from
his
own
table
and
from
the
field
the
colonel
was
a
model
of
generous
hospitality
his
house
was
literally
a
hotel
for
weeks
during
the
summer
months
at
these
times
especially
the
air
was
freighted
with
the
rich
fumes
of
baking
boiling
roasting
and
broiling
the
odors
i
shared
with
the
winds
but
the
meats
were
under
a
more
stringent
monopoly
except
that
occasionally
i
got
a
cake
from
mas
daniel
in
mas
daniel
i
had
a
friend
at
court
from
whom
i
learned
many
things
which
my
eager
curiosity
was
excited
to
know
i
always
knew
when
company
was
expected
and
who
they
were
although
i
was
an
outsider
being
the
property
not
of
lloyd
but
of
a
servant
of
the
wealthy
colonel
on
these
occasions
all
that
pride
taste
and
money
could
do
to
dazzle
and
charm
was
done
who
could
say
that
the
servants
of
lloyd
were
not
well
clad
and
cared
for
after
witnessing
one
of
his
magnificent
entertainments
who
could
say
that
they
did
not
seem
to
glory
in
being
the
slaves
of
such
a
master
who
but
a
fanatic
could
get
up
any
sympathy
for
persons
whose
every
movement
was
agile
easy
and
graceful
and
who
evinced
a
consciousness
of
high
superiority
and
who
would
ever
venture
to
suspect
that
lloyd
was
subject
to
the
troubles
of
ordinary
mortals
master
and
slave
seem
alike
in
their
glory
here
can
it
all
be
seeming
alas
it
may
only
be
a
sham
at
last
this
immense
wealth
this
gilded
splendor
this
profusion
of
luxury
this
exemption
from
toil
this
life
of
ease
this
sea
of
plenty
aye
what
of
it
all
are
the
pearly
gates
of
happiness
and
sweet
content
flung
open
to
such
suitors
from
it
the
poor
slave
on
his
hard
pine
plank
but
scantily
covered
with
his
thin
blanket
sleeps
more
soundly
than
the
feverish
voluptuary
who
reclines
upon
his
feather
bed
and
downy
pillow
food
to
the
indolent
lounger
is
poison
not
sustenance
lurking
beneath
all
their
dishes
are
invisible
spirits
of
evil
ready
to
feed
the
gormandizers
which
aches
pains
fierce
temper
uncontrolled
passions
dyspepsia
rheumatism
lumbago
and
gout
and
of
these
the
lloyds
got
their
full
share
to
the
pampered
love
of
ease
there
is
no
resting
place
what
is
pleasant
today
is
repulsive
tomorrow
what
is
soft
now
is
hard
at
another
time
what
is
sweet
in
the
morning
is
bitter
in
the
evening
neither
to
the
wicked
nor
to
the
idler
is
there
any
solid
peace
troubled
like
the
restless
i
had
excellent
opportunities
of
witnessing
the
restless
discontent
and
the
capricious
irritation
of
the
lloyds
my
fondness
for
horses
not
peculiar
to
me
more
than
to
other
boys
attracted
me
much
of
the
time
to
the
stables
this
establishment
was
especially
under
the
care
of
old
and
young
barney
father
and
son
old
barney
was
a
fine
looking
old
man
of
a
brownish
complexion
who
was
quite
portly
and
wore
a
dignified
aspect
for
a
slave
he
was
evidently
much
devoted
to
his
profession
and
held
his
office
an
honorable
one
he
was
a
farrier
as
well
as
an
ostler
he
could
bleed
remove
lampers
from
the
mouths
of
the
horses
and
was
well
instructed
in
horse
medicines
no
one
on
the
farm
knew
so
well
as
old
barney
what
to
do
with
a
sick
horse
but
his
gifts
and
acquirements
were
of
little
advantage
to
him
his
office
was
by
no
means
an
enviable
one
he
often
got
presents
but
he
got
stripes
as
well
for
in
nothing
was
lloyd
more
unreasonable
and
exacting
than
in
respect
to
the
management
of
his
pleasure
horses
any
supposed
inattention
to
these
animals
were
sure
to
be
visited
with
degrading
punishment
his
horses
and
dogs
fared
better
than
his
men
their
beds
must
be
softer
and
cleaner
than
those
of
his
human
cattle
no
excuse
could
shield
old
barney
if
the
colonel
only
suspected
something
wrong
about
his
horses
and
consequently
he
was
often
punished
when
faultless
it
was
absolutely
painful
to
listen
to
the
many
unreasonable
and
fretful
scoldings
poured
out
at
the
stable
by
lloyd
his
sons
and
of
the
latter
he
had
three
nicholson
winder
and
lownes
these
all
lived
at
the
great
house
a
portion
of
the
year
and
enjoyed
the
luxury
of
whipping
the
servants
when
they
pleased
which
was
by
no
means
unfrequently
a
horse
was
seldom
brought
out
of
the
stable
to
which
no
objection
could
be
raised
there
was
dust
in
his
hair
there
was
a
twist
in
his
reins
his
mane
did
not
lie
straight
he
had
not
been
properly
grained
his
head
did
not
look
well
his
was
not
combed
out
his
fetlocks
had
not
been
properly
trimmed
something
was
always
wrong
listening
to
complaints
however
groundless
barney
must
stand
hat
in
hand
lips
sealed
never
answering
a
word
he
must
make
no
reply
no
explanation
the
judgment
of
the
master
must
be
deemed
infallible
for
his
power
is
absolute
and
irresponsible
in
a
free
state
a
master
thus
complaining
without
cause
of
his
ostler
might
be
told
sir
i
am
sorry
i
can
not
please
you
but
since
i
have
done
the
best
i
can
your
remedy
is
to
dismiss
here
however
the
ostler
must
stand
listen
and
tremble
one
of
the
most
and
humiliating
scenes
i
ever
witnessed
was
the
whipping
of
old
barney
by
lloyd
himself
here
were
two
men
both
advanced
in
years
there
were
the
silvery
locks
of
and
there
was
the
bald
and
brow
of
old
barney
master
and
slave
superior
and
inferior
here
but
at
the
bar
of
god
and
in
the
common
course
of
events
they
must
both
soon
meet
in
another
world
in
a
world
where
all
distinctions
except
those
based
on
obedience
and
disobedience
are
blotted
out
forever
uncover
your
head
said
the
imperious
master
he
was
obeyed
take
off
your
jacket
you
old
rascal
and
off
came
barney
s
jacket
down
on
your
knees
down
knelt
the
old
man
his
shoulders
bare
his
bald
head
glistening
in
the
sun
and
his
aged
knees
on
the
cold
damp
ground
in
his
humble
and
debasing
attitude
the
master
that
master
to
whom
he
had
given
the
best
years
and
the
best
strength
of
his
life
came
forward
and
laid
on
thirty
lashes
with
his
horse
whip
the
old
man
bore
it
patiently
to
the
last
answering
each
blow
with
a
slight
shrug
of
the
shoulders
and
a
groan
i
can
not
think
that
lloyd
succeeded
in
marring
the
flesh
of
old
barney
very
seriously
for
the
whip
was
a
light
riding
whip
but
the
spectacle
of
an
aged
man
a
husband
and
a
father
humbly
kneeling
before
a
worm
of
the
dust
surprised
and
shocked
me
at
the
time
and
since
i
have
grown
old
enough
to
think
on
the
wickedness
of
slavery
few
facts
have
been
of
more
value
to
me
than
this
to
which
i
was
a
witness
it
reveals
slavery
in
its
true
color
and
in
its
maturity
of
repulsive
hatefulness
i
owe
it
to
truth
however
to
say
that
this
was
the
first
and
the
last
time
i
ever
saw
old
barney
or
any
other
slave
compelled
to
kneel
to
receive
a
whipping
i
saw
at
the
stable
another
incident
which
i
will
relate
as
it
is
illustrative
of
a
phase
of
slavery
to
which
i
have
already
referred
in
another
connection
besides
two
other
coachmen
lloyd
owned
one
named
william
who
strangely
enough
was
often
called
by
his
surname
wilks
by
white
and
colored
people
on
the
home
plantation
wilks
was
a
very
fine
looking
man
he
was
about
as
white
as
anybody
on
the
plantation
and
in
manliness
of
form
and
comeliness
of
features
he
bore
a
very
striking
resemblance
to
murray
lloyd
it
was
whispered
and
pretty
generally
admitted
as
a
fact
that
william
wilks
was
a
son
of
lloyd
by
a
highly
favored
who
was
still
on
the
plantation
there
were
many
reasons
for
believing
this
whisper
not
only
in
william
s
appearance
but
in
the
undeniable
freedom
which
he
enjoyed
over
all
others
and
his
apparent
consciousness
of
being
something
more
than
a
slave
to
his
master
it
was
notorious
too
that
william
had
a
deadly
enemy
in
murray
lloyd
whom
he
so
much
resembled
and
that
the
latter
greatly
worried
his
father
with
importunities
to
sell
william
indeed
he
gave
his
father
no
rest
until
he
did
sell
him
to
austin
woldfolk
the
great
at
that
time
before
selling
him
however
tried
what
giving
william
a
whipping
would
do
toward
making
things
smooth
but
this
was
a
failure
it
was
a
compromise
and
defeated
itself
for
immediately
after
the
infliction
the
colonel
atoned
to
william
for
the
abuse
by
giving
him
a
gold
watch
and
chain
another
fact
somewhat
curious
is
that
though
sold
to
the

william
by
means
always
a
mystery
to
me
outbid
all
his
purchasers
paid
for
himself
now
resides
in
baltimore
freeman
is
there
not
room
to
suspect
that
as
the
gold
watch
was
presented
to
atone
for
the
whipping
a
purse
of
gold
was
given
him
by
the

hand
with
which
to
effect
his
purchase
as
an
atonement
for
the
indignity
involved
in
selling
his
own
flesh
and
blood
all
the
circumstances
of
william
on
the
great
house
farm
show
him
to
have
occupied
a
different
position
from
the
other
slaves
and
certainly
there
is
nothing
in
the
supposed
hostility
of
slaveholders
to
amalgamation
to
forbid
the
supposition
that
william
wilks
was
the
son
of
edward
lloyd
amalgamation
is
common
in
every
neighborhood
where
i
have
been
in
slavery
lloyd
was
not
in
the
way
of
knowing
much
of
the
real
opinions
and
feelings
of
his
slaves
respecting
him
the
distance
between
him
and
them
was
far
too
great
to
admit
of
such
knowledge
his
slaves
were
so
numerous
that
he
did
not
know
them
when
he
saw
them
nor
indeed
did
all
his
slaves
know
him
in
this
respect
he
was
inconveniently
rich
it
is
reported
of
him
that
while
riding
along
the
road
one
day
he
met
a
colored
man
and
addressed
him
in
the
usual
way
of
speaking
to
colored
people
on
the
public
highways
of
the
south
well
boy
who
do
you
belong
to
to
lloyd
replied
the
slave
well
does
the
colonel
treat
you
well
no
sir
was
the
ready
reply
what
does
he
work
you
too
hard
yes
well
don
t
he
give
enough
to
eat
yes
sir
he
gives
me
enough
such
as
it
the
colonel
after
ascertaining
where
the
slave
belonged
rode
on
the
slave
also
went
on
about
his
business
not
dreaming
that
he
had
been
conversing
with
his
master
he
thought
said
and
heard
nothing
more
of
the
matter
until
two
or
three
weeks
afterwards
the
poor
man
was
then
informed
by
his
overseer
that
for
having
found
fault
with
his
master
he
was
now
to
be
sold
to
a
georgia
trader
he
was
immediately
chained
and
handcuffed
and
thus
without
a
moment
s
warning
he
was
snatched
away
and
forever
sundered
from
his
family
and
friends
by
a
hand
more
unrelenting
than
that
of
death
is
the
penalty
of
telling
the
simple
truth
in
answer
to
a
series
of
plain
questions
it
is
partly
in
consequence
of
such
facts
that
slaves
when
inquired
of
as
to
their
condition
and
the
character
of
their
masters
almost
invariably
say
they
are
contented
and
that
their
masters
are
kind
slaveholders
have
been
known
to
send
spies
among
their
slaves
to
ascertain
if
possible
their
views
and
feelings
in
regard
to
their
condition
the
frequency
of
this
had
the
effect
to
establish
among
the
slaves
the
maxim
that
a
still
tongue
makes
a
wise
head
they
suppress
the
truth
rather
than
take
the
consequence
of
telling
it
and
in
so
doing
they
prove
themselves
a
part
of
the
human
family
if
they
have
anything
to
say
of
their
master
it
is
generally
something
in
his
favor
especially
when
speaking
to
strangers
i
was
frequently
asked
while
a
slave
if
i
had
a
kind
master
and
i
do
not
remember
ever
to
have
given
a
negative
reply
nor
did
i
when
pursuing
this
course
consider
myself
as
uttering
what
was
utterly
false
for
i
always
measured
the
kindness
of
my
master
by
the
standard
of
kindness
set
up
by
slaveholders
around
us
however
slaves
are
like
other
people
and
imbibe
similar
prejudices
they
are
apt
to
think
better
than
that
of
others
many
under
the
influence
of
this
prejudice
think
their
own
masters
are
better
than
the
masters
of
other
slaves
and
this
too
in
some
cases
when
the
very
reverse
is
true
indeed
it
is
not
uncommon
for
slaves
even
to
fall
out
and
quarrel
among
themselves
about
the
relative
kindness
of
their
masters
contending
for
the
superior
goodness
of
his
own
over
that
of
others
at
the
very
same
time
they
mutually
execrate
their
masters
when
viewed
separately
it
was
so
on
our
plantation
when
lloyd
s
slaves
met
those
of
jacob
jepson
they
seldom
parted
without
a
quarrel
about
their
masters
lloyd
s
slaves
contending
that
he
was
the
richest
and
jepson
s
slaves
that
he
was
the
smartest
man
of
the
two
lloyd
s
slaves
would
boost
his
ability
to
buy
and
sell
jacob
jepson
jepson
s
slaves
would
boast
his
ability
to
whip
lloyd
these
quarrels
would
almost
always
end
in
a
fight
between
the
parties
those
that
beat
were
supposed
to
have
gained
the
point
at
issue
they
seemed
to
think
that
the
greatness
of
their
masters
was
transferable
to
themselves
to
be
a
slave
was
thought
to
be
bad
enough
but
to
be
a
man
slave
was
deemed
a
disgrace
indeed

of
austin
gore
a
sketch
of
his
character
overseers
as
a
class
their
peculiar
characteristics
the
marked
individuality
of
austin
gore
his
sense
of
duty
how
he
whipped
murder
of
poor
denby
how
it
occurred
sensation
how
gore
made
peace
with
lloyd
the
murder
unpunished
another
dreadful
murder
narrated
no
laws
for
the
protection
of
slaves
can
be
enforced
in
the
southern
states
as
i
have
already
intimated
elsewhere
the
slaves
on
lloyd
s
plantation
whose
hard
lot
under
sevier
the
reader
has
already
noticed
and
deplored
were
not
permitted
to
enjoy
the
comparatively
moderate
rule
of
hopkins
the
latter
was
succeeded
by
a
very
different
man
the
name
of
the
new
overseer
was
austin
gore
upon
this
individual
i
would
fix
particular
attention
for
under
his
rule
there
was
more
suffering
from
violence
and
bloodshed
than
had
according
to
the
older
slaves
ever
been
experienced
before
on
this
plantation
i
confess
i
hardly
know
how
to
bring
this
man
fitly
before
the
reader
he
was
it
is
true
an
overseer
and
possessed
to
a
large
extent
the
peculiar
characteristics
of
his
class
yet
to
call
him
merely
an
overseer
would
not
give
the
reader
a
fair
notion
of
the
man
i
speak
of
overseers
as
a
class
they
are
such
they
are
as
distinct
from
the
slaveholding
gentry
of
the
south
as
are
the
fishwomen
of
paris
and
the
of
london
distinct
from
other
members
of
society
they
constitute
a
separate
fraternity
at
the
south
not
less
marked
than
is
the
fraternity
of
park
lane
bullies
in
new
york
they
have
been
arranged
and
classified
by
that
great
law
of
attraction
which
determines
the
spheres
and
affinities
of
men
which
ordains
that
men
whose
malign
and
brutal
propensities
predominate
over
their
moral
and
intellectual
endowments
shall
naturally
fall
into
those
employments
which
promise
the
largest
gratification
to
those
predominating
instincts
or
propensities
the
office
of
overseer
takes
this
raw
material
of
vulgarity
and
brutality
and
stamps
it
as
a
distinct
class
of
southern
society
but
in
this
class
as
in
all
other
classes
there
are
characters
of
marked
individuality
even
while
they
bear
a
general
resemblance
to
the
mass
gore
was
one
of
those
to
whom
a
general
characterization
would
do
no
manner
of
justice
he
was
an
overseer
but
he
was
something
more
with
the
malign
and
tyrannical
qualities
of
an
overseer
he
combined
something
of
the
lawful
master
he
had
the
artfulness
and
the
mean
ambition
of
his
class
but
he
was
wholly
free
from
the
disgusting
swagger
and
noisy
bravado
of
his
fraternity
there
was
an
easy
air
of
independence
about
him
a
calm
and
a
sternness
of
glance
which
might
well
daunt
hearts
less
timid
than
those
of
poor
slaves
accustomed
from
childhood
and
through
life
to
cower
before
a
driver
s
lash
the
home
plantation
of
lloyd
afforded
an
ample
field
for
the
exercise
of
the
qualifications
for
overseership
which
he
possessed
in
such
an
eminent
degree
gore
was
one
of
those
overseers
who
could
torture
the
slightest
word
or
look
into
impudence
he
had
the
nerve
not
only
to
resent
but
to
punish
promptly
and
severely
he
never
allowed
himself
to
be
answered
back
by
a
slave
in
this
he
was
as
lordly
and
as
imperious
as
edward
lloyd
himself
acting
always
up
to
the
maxim
practically
maintained
by
slaveholders
that
it
is
better
that
a
dozen
slaves
suffer
under
the
lash
without
fault
than
that
the
master
or
the
overseer
should
to
have
been
wrong
in
the
presence
of
the
slave
must
be
absolute
guilty
or
not
guilty
it
is
enough
to
be
accused
to
be
sure
of
a
flogging
the
very
presence
of
this
man
gore
was
painful
and
i
shunned
him
as
i
would
have
shunned
a
rattlesnake
his
piercing
black
eyes
and
sharp
shrill
voice
ever
awakened
sensations
of
terror
among
the
slaves
for
so
young
a
man
i
describe
him
as
he
was
or
thirty
years
ago
gore
was
singularly
reserved
and
grave
in
the
presence
of
slaves
he
indulged
in
no
jokes
said
no
funny
things
and
kept
his
own
counsels
other
overseers
how
brutal
soever
they
might
be
were
at
times
inclined
to
gain
favor
with
the
slaves
by
indulging
a
little
pleasantry
but
gore
was
never
known
to
be
guilty
of
any
such
weakness
he
was
always
the
cold
distant
unapproachable
of
edward
lloyd
s
plantation
and
needed
no
higher
pleasure
than
was
involved
in
a
faithful
discharge
of
the
duties
of
his
office
when
he
whipped
he
seemed
to
do
so
from
a
sense
of
duty
and
feared
no
consequences
what
hopkins
did
reluctantly
gore
did
with
alacrity
there
was
a
stern
will
an
reality
about
this
gore
which
would
have
easily
made
him
the
chief
of
a
band
of
pirates
had
his
environments
been
favorable
to
such
a
course
of
life
all
the
coolness
savage
barbarity
and
freedom
from
moral
restraint
which
are
necessary
in
the
character
of
a
centered
i
think
in
this
man
gore
among
many
other
deeds
of
shocking
cruelty
which
he
perpetrated
while
i
was
at
lloyd
s
was
the
murder
of
a
young
colored
man
named
denby
he
was
sometimes
called
bill
denby
or
demby
i
write
from
sound
and
the
sounds
on
lloyd
s
plantation
are
not
very
certain
i
knew
him
well
he
was
a
powerful
young
man
full
of
animal
spirits
and
so
far
as
i
know
he
was
among
the
most
valuable
of
lloyd
s
slaves
in
something
i
know
not
what
he
offended
this
austin
gore
and
in
accordance
with
the
custom
of
the
latter
he
under
took
to
flog
him
he
gave
denby
but
few
stripes
the
latter
broke
away
from
him
and
plunged
into
the
creek
and
standing
there
to
the
depth
of
his
neck
in
water
he
refused
to
come
out
at
the
order
of
the
overseer
whereupon
for
this
refusal
shot
him
dead
it
is
said
that
gore
gave
denby
three
calls
telling
him
that
if
he
did
not
obey
the
last
call
he
would
shoot
him
when
the
third
call
was
given
denby
stood
his
ground
firmly
and
this
raised
the
question
in
the
minds
of
the
slaves
will
he
dare
to
shoot
gore
without
further
parley
and
without
making
any
further
effort
to
induce
denby
to
come
out
of
the
water
raised
his
gun
deliberately
to
his
face
took
deadly
aim
at
his
standing
victim
and
in
an
instant
poor
denby
was
numbered
with
the
dead
his
mangled
body
sank
out
of
sight
and
only
his
warm
red
blood
marked
the
place
where
he
had
stood
this
devilish
outrage
this
fiendish
murder
produced
as
it
was
well
calculated
to
do
a
tremendous
sensation
a
thrill
of
horror
flashed
through
every
soul
on
the
plantation
if
i
may
except
the
guilty
wretch
who
had
committed
the
deed
while
the
slaves
generally
were
and
howling
with
alarm
the
murderer
himself
was
calm
and
collected
and
appeared
as
though
nothing
unusual
had
happened
the
atrocity
roused
my
old
master
and
he
spoke
out
in
reprobation
of
it
but
the
whole
thing
proved
to
be
less
than
a
nine
days
wonder
both
lloyd
and
my
old
master
arraigned
gore
for
his
cruelty
in
the
matter
but
this
amounted
to
nothing
his
reply
or
explanation
as
i
remember
to
have
heard
it
at
the
time
was
that
the
extraordinary
expedient
was
demanded
by
necessity
that
denby
had
become
unmanageable
that
he
had
set
a
dangerous
example
to
the
other
slaves
and
that
without
some
such
prompt
measure
as
that
to
which
he
had
resorted
were
adopted
there
would
be
an
end
to
all
rule
and
order
on
the
plantation
that
very
convenient
covert
for
all
manner
of
cruelty
and
outrage
that
cowardly
that
the
slaves
would
take
the
place
was
pleaded
in
extenuation
of
this
revolting
crime
just
as
it
had
been
cited
in
defense
of
a
thousand
similar
ones
he
argued
that
if
one
slave
refused
to
be
corrected
and
was
allowed
to
escape
with
his
life
when
he
had
been
told
that
he
should
lose
it
if
he
persisted
in
his
course
the
other
slaves
would
soon
copy
his
example
the
result
of
which
would
be
the
freedom
of
the
slaves
and
the
enslavement
of
the
whites
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
gore
s
defense
or
explanation
was
deemed
satisfactory
at
least
to
lloyd
he
was
continued
in
his
office
on
the
plantation
his
fame
as
an
overseer
went
abroad
and
his
horrid
crime
was
not
even
submitted
to
judicial
investigation
the
murder
was
committed
in
the
presence
of
slaves
and
they
of
course
could
neither
institute
a
suit
nor
testify
against
the
murderer
his
bare
word
would
go
further
in
a
court
of
law
than
the
united
testimony
of
ten
thousand
black
witnesses
all
that
gore
had
to
do
was
to
make
his
peace
with
lloyd
this
done
and
the
guilty
perpetrator
of
one
of
the
most
foul
murders
goes
unwhipped
of
justice
and
uncensured
by
the
community
in
which
he
lives
gore
lived
in
michael
s
talbot
county
when
i
left
maryland
if
he
is
still
alive
he
probably
yet
resides
there
and
i
have
no
reason
to
doubt
that
he
is
now
as
highly
esteemed
and
as
greatly
respected
as
though
his
guilty
soul
had
never
been
stained
with
innocent
blood
i
am
well
aware
that
what
i
have
now
written
will
by
some
be
branded
as
false
and
malicious
it
will
be
denied
not
only
that
such
a
thing
ever
did
transpire
as
i
have
now
narrated
but
that
such
a
thing
could
happen
in
i
can
only
say
believe
it
or
not
that
i
have
said
nothing
but
the
literal
truth
gainsay
it
who
may
i
speak
advisedly
when
i
say
this
that
killing
a
slave
or
any
colored
person
in
talbot
county
maryland
is
not
treated
as
a
crime
either
by
the
courts
or
the
community
thomas
lanman
ship
carpenter
of
michael
s
killed
two
slaves
one
of
whom
he
butchered
with
a
hatchet
by
knocking
his
brains
out
he
used
to
boast
of
the
commission
of
the
awful
and
bloody
deed
i
have
heard
him
do
so
laughingly
saying
among
other
things
that
he
was
the
only
benefactor
of
his
country
in
the
company
and
that
when
others
would
do
as
much
as
he
had
done
we
should
be
relieved
of
the
d
d
as
an
evidence
of
the
reckless
disregard
of
human
life
where
the
life
is
that
of
a
slave
i
may
state
the
notorious
fact
that
the
wife
of
giles
hicks
who
lived
but
a
short
distance
from
lloyd
s
with
her
own
hands
murdered
my
wife
s
cousin
a
young
girl
between
fifteen
and
sixteen
years
of
age
mutilating
her
person
in
a
most
shocking
manner
the
atrocious
woman
in
the
paroxysm
of
her
wrath
not
content
with
murdering
her
victim
literally
mangled
her
face
and
broke
her
breast
bone
wild
however
and
infuriated
as
she
was
she
took
the
precaution
to
cause
the
to
be
buried
but
the
facts
of
the
case
coming
abroad
very
speedily
led
to
the
disinterment
of
the
remains
of
the
murdered
a
coroner
s
jury
was
assembled
who
decided
that
the
girl
had
come
to
her
death
by
severe
beating
it
was
ascertained
that
the
offense
for
which
this
girl
was
thus
hurried
out
of
the
world
was
this
she
had
been
set
that
night
and
several
preceding
nights
to
mind
hicks
s
baby
and
having
fallen
into
a
sound
sleep
the
baby
cried
waking
hicks
but
not
the
hicks
becoming
infuriated
at
the
girl
s
tardiness
after
calling
several
times
jumped
from
her
bed
and
seized
a
piece
of
from
the
fireplace
and
then
as
she
lay
fast
asleep
she
deliberately
pounded
in
her
skull
and
and
thus
ended
her
life
i
will
not
say
that
this
most
horrid
murder
produced
no
sensation
in
the
community
it
produce
a
sensation
but
incredible
to
tell
the
moral
sense
of
the
community
was
blunted
too
entirely
by
the
ordinary
nature
of
slavery
horrors
to
bring
the
murderess
to
punishment
a
warrant
was
issued
for
her
arrest
but
for
some
reason
or
other
that
warrant
was
never
served
thus
did
hicks
not
only
escape
condign
punishment
but
even
the
pain
and
mortification
of
being
arraigned
before
a
court
of
justice
whilst
i
am
detailing
the
bloody
deeds
that
took
place
during
my
stay
on
lloyd
s
plantation
i
will
briefly
narrate
another
dark
transaction
which
occurred
about
the
same
time
as
the
murder
of
denby
by
gore
on
the
side
of
the
river
wye
opposite
from
lloyd
s
there
lived
a
beal
bondley
a
wealthy
slaveholder
in
the
direction
of
his
land
and
near
the
shore
there
was
an
excellent
oyster
fishing
ground
and
to
this
some
of
the
slaves
of
lloyd
occasionally
resorted
in
their
little
canoes
at
night
with
a
view
to
make
up
the
deficiency
of
their
scanty
allowance
of
food
by
the
oysters
that
they
could
easily
get
there
this
bondley
took
it
into
his
head
to
regard
as
a
trespass
and
while
an
old
man
belonging
to
lloyd
was
engaged
in
catching
a
few
of
the
many
millions
of
oysters
that
lined
the
bottom
of
that
creek
to
satisfy
his
hunger
the
villainous
bondley
lying
in
ambush
without
the
slightest
ceremony
discharged
the
contents
of
his
musket
into
the
back
and
shoulders
of
the
poor
old
man
as
good
fortune
would
have
it
the
shot
did
not
prove
mortal
and
bondley
came
over
the
next
day
to
see
lloyd
whether
to
pay
him
for
his
property
or
to
justify
himself
for
what
he
had
done
i
know
not
but
this
i
say
the
cruel
and
dastardly
transaction
was
speedily
hushed
up
there
was
very
little
said
about
it
at
all
and
nothing
was
publicly
done
which
looked
like
the
application
of
the
principle
of
justice
to
the
man
whom
only
saved
from
being
an
actual
murderer
one
of
the
commonest
sayings
to
which
my
ears
early
became
accustomed
on
lloyd
s
plantation
and
elsewhere
in
maryland
was
that
it
was
worth
but
half
a
cent
to
kill
a
nigger
and
a
half
a
cent
to
bury
him
and
the
facts
of
my
experience
go
far
to
justify
the
practical
truth
of
this
strange
proverb
laws
for
the
protection
of
the
lives
of
the
slaves
are
as
they
must
needs
be
utterly
incapable
of
being
enforced
where
the
very
parties
who
are
nominally
protected
are
not
permitted
to
give
evidence
in
courts
of
law
against
the
only
class
of
persons
from
whom
abuse
outrage
and
murder
might
be
reasonably
apprehended
while
i
heard
of
numerous
murders
committed
by
slaveholders
on
the
eastern
shores
of
maryland
i
never
knew
a
solitary
instance
in
which
a
slaveholder
was
either
hung
or
imprisoned
for
having
murdered
a
slave
the
usual
pretext
for
killing
a
slave
is
that
the
slave
has
offered
resistance
should
a
slave
when
assaulted
but
raise
his
hand
in
self
defense
the
white
assaulting
party
is
fully
justified
by
southern
or
maryland
public
opinion
in
shooting
the
slave
down
sometimes
this
is
done
simply
because
it
is
alleged
that
the
slave
has
been
saucy
but
here
i
leave
this
phase
of
the
society
of
my
early
childhood
and
will
relieve
the
kind
reader
of
these
details

kind
reception
given
me
by
sophia
auld
little
tommy
my
new
position
my
new
duties
a
turning
point
in
my
history
i
have
nothing
cruel
or
shocking
to
relate
of
my
own
personal
experience
while
i
remained
on
lloyd
s
plantation
at
the
home
of
my
old
master
an
occasional
cuff
from
aunt
katy
and
a
regular
whipping
from
old
master
such
as
any
heedless
and
mischievous
boy
might
get
from
his
father
is
all
that
i
can
mention
of
this
sort
i
was
not
old
enough
to
work
in
the
field
and
there
being
little
else
than
field
work
to
perform
i
had
much
leisure
the
most
i
had
to
do
was
to
drive
up
the
cows
in
the
evening
to
keep
the
front
yard
clean
and
to
perform
small
errands
for
my
young
mistress
lucretia
auld
i
have
reasons
for
thinking
this
lady
was
very
kindly
disposed
toward
me
and
although
i
was
not
often
the
object
of
her
attention
i
constantly
regarded
her
as
my
friend
and
was
always
glad
when
it
was
my
privilege
to
do
her
a
service
in
a
family
where
there
was
so
much
that
was
harsh
cold
and
indifferent
the
slightest
word
or
look
of
kindness
passed
with
me
for
its
full
value
miss
lucretia
as
we
all
continued
to
call
her
long
after
her
marriage
had
bestowed
upon
me
such
words
and
looks
as
taught
me
that
she
pitied
me
if
she
did
not
love
me
in
addition
to
words
and
looks
she
sometimes
gave
me
a
piece
of
bread
and
butter
a
thing
not
set
down
in
the
bill
of
fare
and
which
must
have
been
an
extra
ration
planned
aside
from
either
aunt
katy
or
old
master
solely
out
of
the
tender
regard
and
friendship
she
had
for
me
then
too
i
one
day
got
into
the
wars
with
uncle
able
s
son
ike
and
had
got
sadly
worsted
in
fact
the
little
rascal
had
struck
me
directly
in
the
forehead
with
a
sharp
piece
of
cinder
fused
with
iron
from
the
old
blacksmith
s
forge
which
made
a
cross
in
my
forehead
very
plainly
to
be
seen
now
the
gash
bled
very
freely
and
i
roared
very
loudly
and
betook
myself
home
the
coldhearted
aunt
katy
paid
no
attention
either
to
my
wound
or
my
roaring
except
to
tell
me
it
served
me
right
i
had
no
business
with
ike
it
was
good
for
me
i
would
now
keep
away
from
dem
lloyd
miss
lucretia
in
this
state
of
the
case
came
forward
and
in
quite
a
different
spirit
from
that
manifested
by
aunt
katy
she
called
me
into
the
parlor
an
extra
privilege
of
itself
and
without
using
toward
me
any
of
the
and
reproachful
epithets
of
my
kitchen
tormentor
she
quietly
acted
the
good
samaritan
with
her
own
soft
hand
she
washed
the
blood
from
my
head
and
face
fetched
her
own
balsam
bottle
and
with
the
balsam
wetted
a
nice
piece
of
white
linen
and
bound
up
my
head
the
balsam
was
not
more
healing
to
the
wound
in
my
head
than
her
kindness
was
healing
to
the
wounds
in
my
spirit
made
by
the
unfeeling
words
of
aunt
katy
after
this
miss
lucretia
was
my
friend
i
felt
her
to
be
such
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
simple
act
of
binding
up
my
head
did
much
to
awaken
in
her
mind
an
interest
in
my
welfare
it
is
quite
true
that
this
interest
was
never
very
marked
and
it
seldom
showed
itself
in
anything
more
than
in
giving
me
a
piece
of
bread
when
i
was
hungry
but
this
was
a
great
favor
on
a
slave
plantation
and
i
was
the
only
one
of
the
children
to
whom
such
attention
was
paid
when
very
hungry
i
would
go
into
the
back
yard
and
play
under
miss
lucretia
s
window
when
pretty
severely
pinched
by
hunger
i
had
a
habit
of
singing
which
the
good
lady
very
soon
came
to
understand
as
a
petition
for
a
piece
of
bread
when
i
sung
under
miss
lucretia
s
window
i
was
very
apt
to
get
well
paid
for
my
music
the
reader
will
see
that
i
now
had
two
friends
both
at
important
points
mas
daniel
at
the
great
house
and
miss
lucretia
at
home
from
mas
daniel
i
got
protection
from
the
bigger
boys
and
from
miss
lucretia
i
got
bread
by
singing
when
i
was
hungry
and
sympathy
when
i
was
abused
by
that
termagant
who
had
the
reins
of
government
in
the
kitchen
for
such
friendship
i
felt
deeply
grateful
and
bitter
as
are
my
recollections
of
slavery
i
love
to
recall
any
instances
of
kindness
any
sunbeams
of
humane
treatment
which
found
way
to
my
soul
through
the
iron
grating
of
my
house
of
bondage
such
beams
seem
all
the
brighter
from
the
general
darkness
into
which
they
penetrate
and
the
impression
they
make
is
vividly
distinct
and
beautiful
as
i
have
before
intimated
i
was
seldom
whipped
and
never
severely
by
my
old
master
i
suffered
little
from
the
treatment
i
received
except
from
hunger
and
cold
these
were
my
two
great
physical
troubles
i
could
neither
get
a
sufficiency
of
food
nor
of
clothing
but
i
suffered
less
from
hunger
than
from
cold
in
hottest
summer
and
coldest
winter
i
was
kept
almost
in
a
state
of
nudity
no
shoes
no
stockings
no
jacket
no
trowsers
nothing
but
coarse
sackcloth
or
made
into
a
sort
of
shirt
reaching
down
to
my
knees
this
i
wore
night
and
day
changing
it
once
a
week
in
the
day
time
i
could
protect
myself
pretty
well
by
keeping
on
the
sunny
side
of
the
house
and
in
bad
weather
in
the
corner
of
the
kitchen
chimney
the
great
difficulty
was
to
keep
warm
during
the
night
i
had
no
bed
the
pigs
in
the
pen
had
leaves
and
the
horses
in
the
stable
had
straw
but
the
children
had
no
beds
they
lodged
anywhere
in
the
ample
kitchen
i
slept
generally
in
a
little
closet
without
even
a
blanket
to
cover
me
in
very
cold
weather
i
sometimes
got
down
the
bag
in
which
corn
meal
was
usually
carried
to
the
mill
and
crawled
into
that
sleeping
there
with
my
head
in
and
feet
out
i
was
partly
protected
though
not
comfortable
my
feet
have
been
so
cracked
with
the
frost
that
the
pen
with
which
i
am
writing
might
be
laid
in
the
gashes
the
manner
of
taking
our
meals
at
old
master
s
indicated
but
little
refinement
our
mush
when
sufficiently
cooled
was
placed
in
a
large
wooden
tray
or
trough
like
those
used
in
making
maple
sugar
here
in
the
north
this
tray
was
set
down
either
on
the
floor
of
the
kitchen
or
out
of
doors
on
the
ground
and
the
children
were
called
like
so
many
pigs
and
like
so
many
pigs
they
would
come
and
literally
devour
the
mush
some
with
oyster
shells
some
with
pieces
of
shingles
and
none
with
spoons
he
that
eat
fastest
got
most
and
he
that
was
strongest
got
the
best
place
and
few
left
the
trough
really
satisfied
i
was
the
most
unlucky
of
any
for
aunt
katy
had
no
good
feeling
for
me
and
if
i
pushed
any
of
the
other
children
or
if
they
told
her
anything
unfavorable
of
me
she
always
believed
the
worst
and
was
sure
to
whip
me
as
i
grew
older
and
more
thoughtful
i
was
more
and
more
filled
with
a
sense
of
my
wretchedness
the
cruelty
of
aunt
katy
the
hunger
and
cold
i
suffered
and
the
terrible
reports
of
wrong
and
outrage
which
came
to
my
ear
together
with
what
i
almost
daily
witnessed
led
me
when
yet
but
eight
or
nine
years
old
to
wish
i
had
never
been
born
i
used
to
contrast
my
condition
with
the
in
whose
wild
and
sweet
songs
i
fancied
them
so
happy
their
apparent
joy
only
deepened
the
shades
of
my
sorrow
there
are
thoughtful
days
in
the
lives
of
children
at
least
there
were
in
mine
when
they
grapple
with
all
the
great
primary
subjects
of
knowledge
and
reach
in
a
moment
conclusions
which
no
subsequent
experience
can
shake
i
was
just
as
well
aware
of
the
unjust
unnatural
and
murderous
character
of
slavery
when
nine
years
old
as
i
am
now
without
any
appeal
to
books
to
laws
or
to
authorities
of
any
kind
it
was
enough
to
accept
god
as
a
father
to
regard
slavery
as
a
crime
i
was
not
ten
years
old
when
i
left
lloyd
s
plantation
for
balitmore
sic
i
left
that
plantation
with
inexpressible
joy
i
never
shall
forget
the
ecstacy
with
which
i
received
the
intelligence
from
my
friend
miss
lucretia
that
my
old
master
had
determined
to
let
me
go
to
baltimore
to
live
with
hugh
auld
a
brother
to
thomas
auld
my
old
master
s
i
received
this
information
about
three
days
before
my
departure
they
were
three
of
the
happiest
days
of
my
childhood
i
spent
the
largest
part
of
these
three
days
in
the
creek
washing
off
the
plantation
scurf
and
preparing
for
my
new
home
lucretia
took
a
lively
interest
in
getting
me
ready
she
told
me
i
must
get
all
the
dead
skin
off
my
feet
and
knees
before
i
could
go
to
baltimore
for
the
people
there
were
very
cleanly
and
would
laugh
at
me
if
i
looked
dirty
and
besides
she
was
intending
to
give
me
a
pair
of
trowsers
which
i
should
not
put
on
unless
i
got
all
the
dirt
off
this
was
a
warning
to
which
i
was
bound
to
take
heed
for
the
thought
of
owning
a
pair
of
trowsers
was
great
indeed
it
was
almost
a
sufficient
motive
not
only
to
induce
me
to
scrub
off
the
as
pig
drovers
would
call
it
but
the
skin
as
well
so
i
went
at
it
in
good
earnest
working
for
the
first
time
in
the
hope
of
reward
i
was
greatly
excited
and
could
hardly
consent
to
sleep
lest
i
should
be
left
the
ties
that
ordinarily
bind
children
to
their
homes
were
all
severed
or
they
never
had
any
existence
in
my
case
at
least
so
far
as
the
home
plantation
of
was
concerned
i
therefore
found
no
severe
trail
at
the
moment
of
my
departure
such
as
i
had
experienced
when
separated
from
my
home
in
tuckahoe
my
home
at
my
old
master
s
was
charmless
to
me
it
was
not
home
but
a
prison
to
me
on
parting
from
it
i
could
not
feel
that
i
was
leaving
anything
which
i
could
have
enjoyed
by
staying
my
mother
was
now
long
dead
my
grandmother
was
far
away
so
that
i
seldom
saw
her
aunt
katy
was
my
unrelenting
tormentor
and
my
two
sisters
and
brothers
owing
to
our
early
separation
in
life
and
the
power
of
slavery
were
comparatively
strangers
to
me
the
fact
of
our
relationship
was
almost
blotted
out
i
looked
for
elsewhere
and
was
confident
of
finding
none
which
i
should
relish
less
than
the
one
i
was
leaving
if
however
i
found
in
my
new
home
to
which
i
was
going
with
such
blissful
anticipations
hardship
whipping
and
nakedness
i
had
the
questionable
consolation
that
i
should
not
have
escaped
any
one
of
these
evils
by
remaining
under
the
management
of
aunt
katy
then
too
i
thought
since
i
had
endured
much
in
this
line
on
lloyd
s
plantation
i
could
endure
as
much
elsewhere
and
especially
at
baltimore
for
i
had
something
of
the
feeling
about
that
city
which
is
expressed
in
the
saying
that
being
hanged
in
england
is
better
than
dying
a
natural
death
in
i
had
the
strongest
desire
to
see
baltimore
my
cousin
tom
a
boy
two
or
three
years
older
than
i
had
been
there
and
though
not
fluent
he
stuttered
immoderately
in
speech
he
had
inspired
me
with
that
desire
by
his
eloquent
description
of
the
place
tom
was
sometimes
capt
auld
s
cabin
boy
and
when
he
came
from
baltimore
he
was
always
a
sort
of
hero
amongst
us
at
least
till
his
baltimore
trip
was
forgotten
i
could
never
tell
him
of
anything
or
point
out
anything
that
struck
me
as
beautiful
or
powerful
but
that
he
had
seen
something
in
baltimore
far
surpassing
it
even
the
great
house
itself
with
all
its
pictures
within
and
pillars
without
he
had
the
hardihood
to
say
was
nothing
to
he
bought
a
trumpet
worth
six
pence
and
brought
it
home
told
what
he
had
seen
in
the
windows
of
stores
that
he
had
heard
shooting
crackers
and
seen
soldiers
that
he
had
seen
a
steamboat
that
there
were
ships
in
baltimore
that
could
carry
four
such
sloops
as
the
sally
he
said
a
great
deal
about
the
he
spoke
of
the
bells
ringing
and
of
many
other
things
which
roused
my
curiosity
very
much
and
indeed
which
heightened
my
hopes
of
happiness
in
my
new
home
we
sailed
out
of
miles
river
for
baltimore
early
on
a
saturday
morning
i
remember
only
the
day
of
the
week
for
at
that
time
i
had
no
knowledge
of
the
days
of
the
month
nor
indeed
of
the
months
of
the
year
on
setting
sail
i
walked
aft
and
gave
to
lloyd
s
plantation
what
i
hoped
would
be
the
last
look
i
should
ever
give
to
it
or
to
any
place
like
it
my
strong
aversion
to
the
great
farm
was
not
owing
to
my
own
personal
suffering
but
the
daily
suffering
of
others
and
to
the
certainty
that
i
must
sooner
or
later
be
placed
under
the
barbarous
rule
of
an
overseer
such
as
the
accomplished
gore
or
the
brutal
and
drunken
plummer
after
taking
this
last
view
i
quitted
the
quarter
deck
made
my
way
to
the
bow
of
the
sloop
and
spent
the
remainder
of
the
day
in
looking
ahead
interesting
myself
in
what
was
in
the
distance
rather
than
what
was
near
by
or
behind
the
vessels
sweeping
along
the
bay
were
very
interesting
objects
the
broad
bay
opened
like
a
shoreless
ocean
on
my
boyish
vision
filling
me
with
wonder
and
admiration
late
in
the
afternoon
we
reached
annapolis
the
capital
of
the
state
stopping
there
not
long
enough
to
admit
of
my
going
ashore
it
was
the
first
large
town
i
had
ever
seen
and
though
it
was
inferior
to
many
a
factory
village
in
new
england
my
feelings
on
seeing
it
were
excited
to
a
pitch
very
little
below
that
reached
by
travelers
at
the
first
view
of
rome
the
dome
of
the
state
house
was
especially
imposing
and
surpassed
in
grandeur
the
appearance
of
the
great
house
the
great
world
was
opening
upon
me
very
rapidly
and
i
was
eagerly
acquainting
myself
with
its
multifarious
lessons
we
arrived
in
baltimore
on
sunday
morning
and
landed
at
smith
s
wharf
not
far
from
bowly
s
wharf
we
had
on
board
the
sloop
a
large
flock
of
sheep
for
the
baltimore
market
and
after
assisting
in
driving
them
to
the
slaughter
house
of
curtis
on
loudon
slater
s
hill
i
was
speedily
conducted
by
rich
one
of
the
hands
belonging
to
the
sloop
to
my
new
home
in
alliciana
street
near
gardiner
s
on
fell
s
point
and
hugh
auld
my
new
mistress
and
master
were
both
at
home
and
met
me
at
the
door
with
their
rosy
cheeked
little
son
thomas
to
take
care
of
whom
was
to
constitute
my
future
occupation
in
fact
it
was
to
little
tommy
rather
than
to
his
parents
that
old
master
made
a
present
of
me
and
though
there
was
no
form
or
arrangement
entered
into
i
have
no
doubt
that
and
auld
felt
that
in
due
time
i
should
be
the
legal
property
of
their
and
beloved
boy
tommy
i
was
struck
with
the
appearance
especially
of
my
new
mistress
her
face
was
lighted
with
the
kindliest
emotions
and
the
reflex
influence
of
her
countenance
as
well
as
the
tenderness
with
which
she
seemed
to
regard
me
while
asking
me
sundry
little
questions
greatly
delighted
me
and
lit
up
to
my
fancy
the
pathway
of
my
future
miss
lucretia
was
kind
but
my
new
mistress
miss
sophy
surpassed
her
in
kindness
of
manner
little
thomas
was
affectionately
told
by
his
mother
that
there
was
his
freddy
and
that
freddy
would
take
care
of
him
and
i
was
told
to
be
kind
to
little
tommy
an
injunction
i
scarcely
needed
for
i
had
already
fallen
in
love
with
the
dear
boy
and
with
these
little
ceremonies
i
was
initiated
into
my
new
home
and
entered
upon
my
peculiar
duties
with
not
a
cloud
above
the
horizon
i
may
say
here
that
i
regard
my
removal
from
lloyd
s
plantation
as
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
fortunate
events
of
my
life
viewing
it
in
the
light
of
human
likelihoods
it
is
quite
probable
that
but
for
the
mere
circumstance
of
being
thus
removed
before
the
rigors
of
slavery
had
fastened
upon
me
before
my
young
spirit
had
been
crushed
under
the
iron
control
of
the
instead
of
being
today
a
freeman
i
might
have
been
wearing
the
galling
chains
of
slavery
i
have
sometimes
felt
however
that
there
was
something
more
intelligent
than
and
something
more
certain
than
to
be
seen
in
the
circumstance
if
i
have
made
any
progress
in
knowledge
if
i
have
cherished
any
honorable
aspirations
or
have
in
any
manner
worthily
discharged
the
duties
of
a
member
of
an
oppressed
people
this
little
circumstance
must
be
allowed
its
due
weight
in
giving
my
life
that
direction
i
have
ever
regarded
it
as
the
first
plain
manifestation
of
that
that
shapes
our
ends
rough
hew
them
as
we
i
was
not
the
only
boy
on
the
plantation
that
might
have
been
sent
to
live
in
baltimore
there
was
a
wide
margin
from
which
to
select
there
were
boys
younger
boys
older
and
boys
of
the
same
age
belonging
to
my
old
master
some
at
his
own
house
and
some
at
his
farm
but
the
high
privilege
fell
to
my
lot
i
may
be
deemed
superstitious
and
egotistical
in
regarding
this
event
as
a
special
interposition
of
divine
providence
in
my
favor
but
the
thought
is
a
part
of
my
history
and
i
should
be
false
to
the
earliest
and
most
cherished
sentiments
of
my
soul
if
i
suppressed
or
hesitated
to
avow
that
opinion
although
it
may
be
characterized
as
irrational
by
the
wise
and
ridiculous
by
the
scoffer
from
my
earliest
recollections
of
serious
matters
i
date
the
entertainment
of
something
like
an
ineffaceable
conviction
that
slavery
would
not
always
be
able
to
hold
me
within
its
foul
embrace
and
this
conviction
like
a
word
of
living
faith
strengthened
me
through
the
darkest
trials
of
my
lot
this
good
spirit
was
from
god
and
to
him

thanksgiving

praise

once
in

with
hard

pavements
under
my
feet
which
almost
raised
blisters
by
their
very
heat
for
it
was
in
the
height
of
summer
walled
in
on
all
sides
by
towering
brick
buildings
with
troops
of
hostile
boys
ready
to
pounce
upon
me
at
every
street
corner
with
new
and
strange
objects
glaring
upon
me
at
every
step
and
with
startling
sounds
reaching
my
ears
from
all
directions
i
for
a
time
thought
that
after
all
the
home
plantation
was
a
more
desirable
place
of
residence
than
my
home
on
alliciana
street
in
baltimore
my
country
eyes
and
ears
were
confused
and
bewildered
here
but
the
boys
were
my
chief
trouble
they
chased
me
and
called
me
eastern
shore
man
till
really
i
almost
wished
myself
back
on
the
eastern
shore
i
had
to
undergo
a
sort
of
moral
acclimation
and
when
that
was
over
i
did
much
better
my
new
mistress
happily
proved
to
be
all
she
to
be
when
with
her
husband
she
met
me
at
the
door
with
a
most
beaming
benignant
countenance
she
was
naturally
of
an
excellent
disposition
kind
gentle
and
cheerful
the
supercilious
contempt
for
the
rights
and
feelings
of
the
slave
and
the
petulance
and
bad
humor
which
generally
characterize
slaveholding
ladies
were
all
quite
absent
from
kind
miss
sophia
s
manner
and
bearing
toward
me
she
had
in
truth
never
been
a
slaveholder
but
had
a
thing
quite
unusual
in
the
south
depended
almost
entirely
upon
her
own
industry
for
a
living
to
this
fact
the
dear
lady
no
doubt
owed
the
excellent
preservation
of
her
natural
goodness
of
heart
for
slavery
can
change
a
saint
into
a
sinner
and
an
angel
into
a
demon
i
hardly
knew
how
to
behave
toward
miss
sopha
as
i
used
to
call
hugh
auld
i
had
been
treated
as
a
on
the
plantation
i
was
treated
as
a
now
i
could
not
even
approach
her
as
i
had
formerly
approached
thomas
auld
how
could
i
hang
down
my
head
and
speak
with
bated
breath
when
there
was
no
pride
to
scorn
me
no
coldness
to
repel
me
and
no
hatred
to
inspire
me
with
fear
i
therefore
soon
learned
to
regard
her
as
something
more
akin
to
a
mother
than
a
slaveholding
mistress
the
crouching
servility
of
a
slave
usually
so
acceptable
a
quality
to
the
haughty
slaveholder
was
not
understood
nor
desired
by
this
gentle
woman
so
far
from
deeming
it
impudent
in
a
slave
to
look
her
straight
in
the
face
as
some
slaveholding
ladies
do
she
seemed
ever
to
say
look
up
child
don
t
be
afraid
see
i
am
full
of
kindness
and
good
will
toward
the
hands
belonging
to
lloyd
s
sloop
esteemed
it
a
great
privilege
to
be
the
bearers
of
parcels
or
messages
to
my
new
mistress
for
whenever
they
came
they
were
sure
of
a
most
kind
and
pleasant
reception
if
little
thomas
was
her
son
and
her
most
dearly
beloved
child
she
for
a
time
at
least
made
me
something
like
his
in
her
affections
if
dear
tommy
was
exalted
to
a
place
on
his
mother
s
knee
feddy
was
honored
by
a
place
at
his
mother
s
side
nor
did
he
lack
the
caressing
strokes
of
her
gentle
hand
to
convince
him
that
though
he
was
not
auld
was
not
only
a
woman
but
she
was
remarkably
pious
frequent
in
her
attendance
of
public
worship
much
given
to
reading
the
bible
and
to
chanting
hymns
of
praise
when
alone
hugh
auld
was
altogether
a
different
character
he
cared
very
little
about
religion
knew
more
of
the
world
and
was
more
of
the
world
than
his
wife
he
set
out
doubtless
to
be
as
the
world
goes
a
respectable
man
and
to
get
on
by
becoming
a
successful
ship
builder
in
that
city
of
ship
building
this
was
his
ambition
and
it
fully
occupied
him
i
was
of
course
of
very
little
consequence
to
him
compared
with
what
i
was
to
good
auld
and
when
he
smiled
upon
me
as
he
sometimes
did
the
smile
was
borrowed
from
his
lovely
wife
and
like
all
borrowed
light
was
transient
and
vanished
with
the
source
whence
it
was
derived
while
i
must
characterize
master
hugh
as
being
a
very
sour
man
and
of
forbidding
appearance
it
is
due
to
him
to
acknowledge
that
he
was
never
very
cruel
to
me
according
to
the
notion
of
cruelty
in
maryland
the
first
year
or
two
which
i
spent
in
his
house
he
left
me
almost
exclusively
to
the
management
of
his
wife
she
was
my
in
hands
so
tender
as
hers
and
in
the
absence
of
the
cruelties
of
the
plantation
i
became
both
physically
and
mentally
much
more
sensitive
to
good
and
ill
treatment
and
perhaps
suffered
more
from
a
frown
from
my
mistress
than
i
formerly
did
from
a
cuff
at
the
hands
of
aunt
katy
instead
of
the
cold
damp
floor
of
my
old
master
s
kitchen
i
found
myself
on
carpets
for
the
corn
bag
in
winter
i
now
had
a
good
straw
bed
well
furnished
with
covers
for
the
coarse
in
the
morning
i
now
had
good
bread
and
mush
occasionally
for
my
poor
shirt
reaching
to
my
knees
i
had
good
clean
clothes
i
was
really
well
off
my
employment
was
to
run
errands
and
to
take
care
of
tommy
to
prevent
his
getting
in
the
way
of
carriages
and
to
keep
him
out
of
harm
s
way
generally
tommy
and
i
and
his
mother
got
on
swimmingly
together
for
a
time
i
say
a
because
the
fatal
poison
of
irresponsible
power
and
the
natural
influence
of
slavery
customs
were
not
long
in
making
a
suitable
impression
on
the
gentle
and
loving
disposition
of
my
excellent
mistress
at
first
auld
evidently
regarded
me
simply
as
a
child
like
any
other
child
she
had
not
come
to
regard
me
as
this
latter
thought
was
a
thing
of
conventional
growth
the
first
was
natural
and
spontaneous
a
noble
nature
like
hers
could
not
instantly
be
wholly
perverted
and
it
took
several
years
to
change
the
natural
sweetness
of
her
temper
into
fretful
bitterness
in
her
worst
estate
however
there
were
during
the
first
seven
years
i
lived
with
her
occasional
returns
of
her
former
kindly
disposition
the
frequent
hearing
of
my
mistress
reading
the
bible
for
she
often
read
aloud
when
her
husband
was
absent
soon
awakened
my
curiosity
in
respect
to
this
of
reading
and
roused
in
me
the
desire
to
learn
having
no
fear
of
my
kind
mistress
before
my
eyes
she
had
then
given
me
no
reason
to
fear
i
frankly
asked
her
to
teach
me
to
read
and
without
hesitation
the
dear
woman
began
the
task
and
very
soon
by
her
assistance
i
was
master
of
the
alphabet
and
could
spell
words
of
three
or
four
letters
my
mistress
seemed
almost
as
proud
of
my
progress
as
if
i
had
been
her
own
child
and
supposing
that
her
husband
would
be
as
well
pleased
she
made
no
secret
of
what
she
was
doing
for
me
indeed
she
exultingly
told
him
of
the
aptness
of
her
pupil
of
her
intention
to
persevere
in
teaching
me
and
of
the
duty
which
she
felt
it
to
teach
me
at
least
to
read
here
arose
the
first
cloud
over
my
baltimore
prospects
the
precursor
of
drenching
rains
and
chilling
blasts
master
hugh
was
amazed
at
the
simplicity
of
his
spouse
and
probably
for
the
first
time
he
unfolded
to
her
the
true
philosophy
of
slavery
and
the
peculiar
rules
necessary
to
be
observed
by
masters
and
mistresses
in
the
management
of
their
human
chattels
auld
promptly
forbade
continuance
of
her
instruction
telling
her
in
the
first
place
that
the
thing
itself
was
unlawful
that
it
was
also
unsafe
and
could
only
lead
to
mischief
to
use
his
own
words
further
he
said
if
you
give
a
nigger
an
inch
he
will
take
an
ell
he
should
know
nothing
but
the
will
of
his
master
and
learn
to
obey
if
you
teach
that
nigger
speaking
of
myself
how
to
read
the
bible
there
will
be
no
keeping
him
it
would
forever
unfit
him
for
the
duties
of
a
slave
and
as
to
himself
learning
would
do
him
no
good
but
probably
a
great
deal
of
harm
making
him
disconsolate
and
if
you
learn
him
now
to
read
he
ll
want
to
know
how
to
write
and
this
accomplished
he
ll
be
running
away
with
such
was
the
tenor
of
master
hugh
s
oracular
exposition
of
the
true
philosophy
of
training
a
human
chattel
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
he
very
clearly
comprehended
the
nature
and
the
requirements
of
the
relation
of
master
and
slave
his
discourse
was
the
first
decidedly
lecture
to
which
it
had
been
my
lot
to
listen
auld
evidently
felt
the
force
of
his
remarks
and
like
an
obedient
wife
began
to
shape
her
course
in
the
direction
indicated
by
her
husband
the
effect
of
his
words
was
neither
slight
nor
transitory
his
iron
sentences
cold
and
harsh
sunk
deep
into
my
heart
and
stirred
up
not
only
my
feelings
into
a
sort
of
rebellion
but
awakened
within
me
a
slumbering
train
of
vital
thought
it
was
a
new
and
special
revelation
dispelling
a
painful
mystery
against
which
my
youthful
understanding
had
struggled
and
struggled
in
vain
to
wit
the
man
s
power
to
perpetuate
the
enslavement
of
the
man
very
well
thought
i
knowledge
unfits
a
child
to
be
a
i
instinctively
assented
to
the
proposition
and
from
that
moment
i
understood
the
direct
pathway
from
slavery
to
freedom
this
was
just
what
i
needed
and
i
got
it
at
a
time
and
from
a
source
whence
i
least
expected
it
i
was
saddened
at
the
thought
of
losing
the
assistance
of
my
kind
mistress
but
the
information
so
instantly
derived
to
some
extent
compensated
me
for
the
loss
i
had
sustained
in
this
direction
wise
as
auld
was
he
evidently
underrated
my
comprehension
and
had
little
idea
of
the
use
to
which
i
was
capable
of
putting
the
impressive
lesson
he
was
giving
to
his
wife
wanted
me
to
be
slave
i
had
already
voted
against
that
on
the
home
plantation
of
lloyd
that
which
he
most
loved
i
most
hated
and
the
very
determination
which
he
expressed
to
keep
me
in
ignorance
only
rendered
me
the
more
resolute
in
seeking
intelligence
in
learning
to
read
therefore
i
am
not
sure
that
i
do
not
owe
quite
as
much
to
the
opposition
of
my
master
as
to
the
kindly
assistance
of
my
amiable
mistress
i
acknowledge
the
benefit
rendered
me
by
the
one
and
by
the
other
believing
that
but
for
my
mistress
i
might
have
grown
up
in
ignorance
i
had
resided
but
a
short
time
in
baltimore
before
i
observed
a
marked
difference
in
the
manner
of
treating
slaves
generally
from
which
i
had
witnessed
in
that
isolated
and
part
of
the
country
where
i
began
life
a
city
slave
is
almost
a
free
citizen
in
baltimore
compared
with
a
slave
on
lloyd
s
plantation
he
is
much
better
fed
and
clothed
is
less
dejected
in
his
appearance
and
enjoys
privileges
altogether
unknown
to
the
slave
on
the
plantation
slavery
dislikes
a
dense
population
in
which
there
is
a
majority
of
the
general
sense
of
decency
that
must
pervade
such
a
population
does
much
to
check
and
prevent
those
outbreaks
of
atrocious
cruelty
and
those
dark
crimes
without
a
name
almost
openly
perpetrated
on
the
plantation
he
is
a
desperate
slaveholder
who
will
shock
the
humanity
of
his
neighbors
by
the
cries
of
the
lacerated
slaves
and
very
few
in
the
city
are
willing
to
incur
the
odium
of
being
cruel
masters
i
found
in
baltimore
that
no
man
was
more
odious
to
the
white
as
well
as
to
the
colored
people
than
he
who
had
the
reputation
of
starving
his
slaves
work
them
flog
them
if
need
be
but
don
t
starve
them
these
are
however
some
painful
exceptions
to
this
rule
while
it
is
quite
true
that
most
of
the
slaveholders
in
baltimore
feed
and
clothe
their
slaves
well
there
are
others
who
keep
up
their
country
cruelties
in
the
city
an
instance
of
this
sort
is
furnished
in
the
case
of
a
family
who
lived
directly
opposite
to
our
house
and
were
named
hamilton
hamilton
owned
two
slaves
their
names
were
henrietta
and
mary
they
had
always
been
house
slaves
one
was
aged
about
and
the
other
about
fourteen
they
were
a
fragile
couple
by
nature
and
the
treatment
they
received
was
enough
to
break
down
the
constitution
of
a
horse
of
all
the
dejected
emaciated
mangled
and
excoriated
creatures
i
ever
saw
those
two
girls
in
the
refined
church
going
and
christian
city
of
baltimore
were
the
most
deplorable
of
stone
must
that
heart
be
made
that
could
look
upon
henrietta
and
mary
without
being
sickened
to
the
core
with
sadness
especially
was
mary
a
object
her
head
neck
and
shoulders
were
literally
cut
to
pieces
i
have
frequently
felt
her
head
and
found
it
nearly
covered
over
with
festering
sores
caused
by
the
lash
of
her
cruel
mistress
i
do
not
know
that
her
master
ever
whipped
her
but
i
have
often
been
an
eye
witness
of
the
revolting
and
brutal
inflictions
by
hamilton
and
what
lends
a
deeper
shade
to
this
woman
s
conduct
is
the
fact
that
almost
in
the
very
moments
of
her
shocking
outrages
of
humanity
and
decency
she
would
charm
you
by
the
sweetness
of
her
voice
and
her
seeming
piety
she
used
to
sit
in
a
large
rocking
chair
near
the
middle
of
the
room
with
a
heavy
cowskin
such
as
i
have
elsewhere
described
and
i
speak
within
the
truth
when
i
say
that
these
girls
seldom
passed
that
chair
during
the
day
without
a
blow
from
that
cowskin
either
upon
their
bare
arms
or
upon
their
shoulders
as
they
passed
her
she
would
draw
her
cowskin
and
give
them
a
blow
saying
move
faster
you
black
jip
and
again
take
that
you
black
jip
continuing
if
you
don
t
move
faster
i
will
give
you
then
the
lady
would
go
on
singing
her
sweet
hymns
as
though
her
soul
were
sighing
for
the
holy
realms
of
paradise
added
to
the
cruel
lashings
to
which
these
poor
were
subjected
enough
in
themselves
to
crush
the
spirit
of
men
they
were
really
kept
nearly
half
starved
they
seldom
knew
what
it
was
to
eat
a
full
meal
except
when
they
got
it
in
the
kitchens
of
neighbors
less
mean
and
stingy
than
the
hamilton
i
have
seen
poor
mary
contending
for
the
offal
with
the
pigs
in
the
street
so
much
was
the
poor
girl
pinched
kicked
cut
and
pecked
to
pieces
that
the
boys
in
the
street
knew
her
only
by
the
name
of
pecked
a
name
derived
from
the
scars
and
blotches
on
her
neck
head
and
shoulders
it
is
some
relief
to
this
picture
of
slavery
in
baltimore
to
say
what
is
but
the
simple
truth
that
hamilton
s
treatment
of
her
slaves
was
generally
condemned
as
disgraceful
and
shocking
but
while
i
say
this
it
must
also
be
remembered
that
the
very
parties
who
censured
the
cruelty
of
hamilton
would
have
condemned
and
promptly
punished
any
attempt
to
interfere
with
hamilton
s
to
cut
and
slash
her
slaves
to
pieces
there
must
be
no
force
between
the
slave
and
the
slaveholder
to
restrain
the
power
of
the
one
and
protect
the
weakness
of
the
other
and
the
cruelty
of
hamilton
is
as
justly
chargeable
to
the
upholders
of
the
slave
system
as
drunkenness
is
chargeable
on
those
who
by
precept
and
example
or
by
indifference
uphold
the
drinking
system
chapter
xi
a
change
came
o
er
the
spirit
of
my
dream
how
i
learned
to
read
my
mistress
her
slaveholding
duties
their
deplorable
effects
upon
her
originally
noble
nature
the
conflict
in
her
mind
her
final
opposition
to
my
learning
to
read
too
late
she
had
given
me
the
inch
i
was
resolved
to
take
the
ell
how
i
pursued
my
education
my
tutors
how
i
compensated
them
what
progress
i
made
slavery
what
i
heard
said
about
it
thirteen
years
old
the
a
rich
scene
a
dialogue
speeches
of
chatham
sheridan
pitt
and
fox
knowledge
ever
increasing
my
eyes
opened
liberty
how
i
pined
for
it
my
sadness
the
dissatisfaction
of
my
poor
mistress
my
hatred
of
slavery
one
upas
tree
overshadowed
us
both
i
lived
in
the
family
of
master
hugh
at
baltimore
seven
years
during
which
time
as
the
almanac
makers
say
of
the
weather
my
condition
was
variable
the
most
interesting
feature
of
my
history
here
was
my
learning
to
read
and
write
under
somewhat
marked
disadvantages
in
attaining
this
knowledge
i
was
compelled
to
resort
to
indirections
by
no
means
congenial
to
my
nature
and
which
were
really
humiliating
to
me
my
mistress
who
as
the
reader
has
already
seen
had
begun
to
teach
me
was
suddenly
checked
in
her
benevolent
design
by
the
strong
advice
of
her
husband
in
faithful
compliance
with
this
advice
the
good
lady
had
not
only
ceased
to
instruct
me
herself
but
had
set
her
face
as
a
flint
against
my
learning
to
read
by
any
means
it
is
due
however
to
my
mistress
to
say
that
she
did
not
adopt
this
course
in
all
its
stringency
at
the
first
she
either
thought
it
unnecessary
or
she
lacked
the
depravity
indispensable
to
shutting
me
up
in
mental
darkness
it
was
at
least
necessary
for
her
to
have
some
training
and
some
hardening
in
the
exercise
of
the
slaveholder
s
prerogative
to
make
her
equal
to
forgetting
my
human
nature
and
character
and
to
treating
me
as
a
thing
destitute
of
a
moral
or
an
intellectual
nature
auld
my
mistress
was
as
i
have
said
a
most
kind
and
woman
and
in
the
humanity
of
her
heart
and
the
simplicity
of
her
mind
she
set
out
when
i
first
went
to
live
with
her
to
treat
me
as
she
supposed
one
human
being
ought
to
treat
another
it
is
easy
to
see
that
in
entering
upon
the
duties
of
a
slaveholder
some
little
experience
is
needed
nature
has
done
almost
nothing
to
prepare
men
and
women
to
be
either
slaves
or
slaveholders
nothing
but
rigid
training
long
persisted
in
can
perfect
the
character
of
the
one
or
the
other
one
can
not
easily
forget
to
love
freedom
and
it
is
as
hard
to
cease
to
respect
that
natural
love
in
our
fellow
creatures
on
entering
upon
the
career
of
a
slaveholding
mistress
auld
was
singularly
deficient
nature
which
fits
nobody
for
such
an
office
had
done
less
for
her
than
any
lady
i
had
known
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
induce
her
to
think
and
to
feel
that
the
boy
who
stood
by
her
side
and
even
leaned
on
her
lap
who
was
loved
by
little
tommy
and
who
loved
little
tommy
in
turn
sustained
to
her
only
the
relation
of
a
chattel
i
was
than
that
and
she
felt
me
to
be
more
than
that
i
could
talk
and
sing
i
could
laugh
and
weep
i
could
reason
and
remember
i
could
love
and
hate
i
was
human
and
she
dear
lady
knew
and
felt
me
to
be
so
how
could
she
then
treat
me
as
a
brute
without
a
mighty
struggle
with
all
the
noble
powers
of
her
own
soul
that
struggle
came
and
the
will
and
power
of
the
husband
was
victorious
her
noble
soul
was
overthrown
but
he
that
overthrew
it
did
not
himself
escape
the
consequences
he
not
less
than
the
other
parties
was
injured
in
his
domestic
peace
by
the
fall
when
i
went
into
their
family
it
was
the
abode
of
happiness
and
contentment
the
mistress
of
the
house
was
a
model
of
affection
and
tenderness
her
fervent
piety
and
watchful
uprightness
made
it
impossible
to
see
her
without
thinking
and
feeling
woman
is
a
there
was
no
sorrow
nor
suffering
for
which
she
had
not
a
tear
and
there
was
no
innocent
joy
for
which
she
did
not
a
smile
she
had
bread
for
the
hungry
clothes
for
the
naked
and
comfort
for
every
mourner
that
came
within
her
reach
slavery
soon
proved
its
ability
to
divest
her
of
these
excellent
qualities
and
her
home
of
its
early
happiness
conscience
can
not
stand
much
violence
once
thoroughly
broken
down
is
he
that
can
repair
the
damage
it
may
be
broken
toward
the
slave
on
sunday
and
toward
the
master
on
monday
it
can
not
endure
such
shocks
it
must
stand
entire
or
it
does
not
stand
at
all
if
my
condition
waxed
bad
that
of
the
family
waxed
not
better
the
first
step
in
the
wrong
direction
was
the
violence
done
to
nature
and
to
conscience
in
arresting
the
benevolence
that
would
have
enlightened
my
young
mind
in
ceasing
to
instruct
me
she
must
begin
to
justify
herself
herself
and
once
consenting
to
take
sides
in
such
a
debate
she
was
riveted
to
her
position
one
needs
very
little
knowledge
of
moral
philosophy
to
see
my
mistress
now
landed
she
finally
became
even
more
violent
in
her
opposition
to
my
learning
to
read
than
was
her
husband
himself
she
was
not
satisfied
with
simply
doing
as
as
her
husband
had
commanded
her
but
seemed
resolved
to
better
his
instruction
nothing
appeared
to
make
my
poor
mistress
after
her
turning
toward
the
downward
path
more
angry
than
seeing
me
seated
in
some
nook
or
corner
quietly
reading
a
book
or
a
newspaper
i
have
had
her
rush
at
me
with
the
utmost
fury
and
snatch
from
my
hand
such
newspaper
or
book
with
something
of
the
wrath
and
consternation
which
a
traitor
might
be
supposed
to
feel
on
being
discovered
in
a
plot
by
some
dangerous
spy
auld
was
an
apt
woman
and
the
advice
of
her
husband
and
her
own
experience
soon
demonstrated
to
her
entire
satisfaction
that
education
and
slavery
are
incompatible
with
each
other
when
this
conviction
was
thoroughly
established
i
was
most
narrowly
watched
in
all
my
movements
if
i
remained
in
a
separate
room
from
the
family
for
any
considerable
length
of
time
i
was
sure
to
be
suspected
of
having
a
book
and
was
at
once
called
upon
to
give
an
account
of
myself
all
this
however
was
entirely
the
first
and
never
to
be
retraced
step
had
been
taken
in
teaching
me
the
alphabet
in
the
days
of
her
simplicity
and
kindness
my
mistress
had
given
me
the
inch
and
now
no
ordinary
precaution
could
prevent
me
from
taking
the
seized
with
a
determination
to
learn
to
read
at
any
cost
i
hit
upon
many
expedients
to
accomplish
the
desired
end
the
plea
which
i
mainly
adopted
and
the
one
by
which
i
was
most
successful
was
that
of
using
my
young
white
playmates
with
whom
i
met
in
the
streets
as
teachers
i
used
to
carry
almost
constantly
a
copy
of
webster
s
spelling
book
in
my
pocket
and
when
sent
of
errands
or
when
play
time
was
allowed
me
i
would
step
with
my
young
friends
aside
and
take
a
lesson
in
spelling
i
generally
paid
my
to
the
boys
with
bread
which
i
also
carried
in
my
pocket
for
a
single
biscuit
any
of
my
hungry
little
comrades
would
give
me
a
lesson
more
valuable
to
me
than
bread
not
every
one
however
demanded
this
consideration
for
there
were
those
who
took
pleasure
in
teaching
me
whenever
i
had
a
chance
to
be
taught
by
them
i
am
strongly
tempted
to
give
the
names
of
two
or
three
of
those
little
boys
as
a
slight
testimonial
of
the
gratitude
and
affection
i
bear
them
but
prudence
forbids
not
that
it
would
injure
me
but
it
might
possibly
embarrass
them
for
it
is
almost
an
unpardonable
offense
to
do
any
thing
directly
or
indirectly
to
promote
a
slave
s
freedom
in
a
slave
state
it
is
enough
to
say
of
my
little
play
fellows
that
they
lived
on
philpot
street
very
near
durgin
bailey
s
shipyard
although
slavery
was
a
delicate
subject
and
very
cautiously
talked
about
among
grown
up
people
in
maryland
i
frequently
talked
about
it
and
that
very
freely
with
the
white
boys
i
would
sometimes
say
to
them
while
seated
on
a
curb
stone
or
a
cellar
door
i
wish
i
could
be
free
as
you
will
be
when
you
get
to
be
you
will
be
free
you
know
as
soon
as
you
are
and
can
go
where
you
like
but
i
am
a
slave
for
life
have
i
not
as
good
a
right
to
be
free
as
you
have
words
like
these
i
observed
always
troubled
them
and
i
had
no
small
satisfaction
in
wringing
from
the
boys
occasionally
that
fresh
and
bitter
condemnation
of
slavery
that
springs
from
nature
unseared
and
unperverted
of
all
consciences
let
me
have
those
to
deal
with
which
have
not
been
bewildered
by
the
cares
of
life
i
do
not
remember
ever
to
have
met
with
a
while
i
was
in
slavery
who
defended
the
slave
system
but
i
have
often
had
boys
to
console
me
with
the
hope
that
something
would
yet
occur
by
which
i
might
be
made
free
over
and
over
again
they
have
told
me
that
they
believed
i
had
as
good
a
right
to
be
free
as
had
and
that
they
did
not
believe
god
ever
made
any
one
to
be
a
the
reader
will
easily
see
that
such
little
conversations
with
my
play
fellows
had
no
tendency
to
weaken
my
love
of
liberty
nor
to
render
me
contented
with
my
condition
as
a
slave
when
i
was
about
thirteen
years
old
and
had
succeeded
in
learning
to
read
every
increase
of
knowledge
especially
respecting
the
free
states
added
something
to
the
almost
intolerable
burden
of
the
thought
i
am
a
slave
for
life
to
my
bondage
i
saw
no
end
it
was
a
terrible
reality
and
i
shall
never
be
able
to
tell
how
sadly
that
thought
chafed
my
young
spirit
fortunately
or
unfortunately
about
this
time
in
my
life
i
had
made
enough
money
to
buy
what
was
then
a
very
popular
school
book
viz
the
i
bought
this
addition
to
my
library
of
knight
on
thames
street
fell
s
point
baltimore
and
paid
him
fifty
cents
for
it
i
was
first
led
to
buy
this
book
by
hearing
some
little
boys
say
they
were
going
to
learn
some
little
pieces
out
of
it
for
the
exhibition
this
volume
was
indeed
a
rich
treasure
and
every
opportunity
afforded
me
for
a
time
was
spent
in
diligently
perusing
it
among
much
other
interesting
matter
that
which
i
had
perused
and
reperused
with
unflagging
satisfaction
was
a
short
dialogue
between
a
master
and
his
slave
the
slave
is
represented
as
having
been
recaptured
in
a
second
attempt
to
run
away
and
the
master
opens
the
dialogue
with
an
upbraiding
speech
charging
the
slave
with
ingratitude
and
demanding
to
know
what
he
has
to
say
in
his
own
defense
thus
upbraided
and
thus
called
upon
to
reply
the
slave
rejoins
that
he
knows
how
little
anything
that
he
can
say
will
avail
seeing
that
he
is
completely
in
the
hands
of
his
owner
and
with
noble
resolution
calmly
says
i
submit
to
my
touched
by
the
slave
s
answer
the
master
insists
upon
his
further
speaking
and
recapitulates
the
many
acts
of
kindness
which
he
has
performed
toward
the
slave
and
tells
him
he
is
permitted
to
speak
for
himself
thus
invited
to
the
debate
the
quondam
slave
made
a
spirited
defense
of
himself
and
thereafter
the
whole
argument
for
and
against
slavery
was
brought
out
the
master
was
vanquished
at
every
turn
in
the
argument
and
seeing
himself
to
be
thus
vanquished
he
generously
and
meekly
emancipates
the
slave
with
his
best
wishes
for
his
prosperity
it
is
scarcely
neccessary
sic
to
say
that
a
dialogue
with
such
an
origin
and
such
an
ending
read
when
the
fact
of
my
being
a
slave
was
a
constant
burden
of
grief
powerfully
affected
me
and
i
could
not
help
feeling
that
the
day
might
come
when
the
answers
made
by
the
slave
to
the
master
in
this
instance
would
find
their
counterpart
in
myself
this
however
was
not
all
the
fanaticism
which
i
found
in
this
i
met
there
one
of
sheridan
s
mighty
speeches
on
the
subject
of
catholic
emancipation
lord
chatham
s
speech
on
the
american
war
and
speeches
by
the
great
william
pitt
and
by
fox
these
were
all
choice
documents
to
me
and
i
read
them
over
and
over
again
with
an
interest
that
was
ever
increasing
because
it
was
ever
gaining
in
intelligence
for
the
more
i
read
them
the
better
i
understood
them
the
reading
of
these
speeches
added
much
to
my
limited
stock
of
language
and
enabled
me
to
give
tongue
to
many
interesting
thoughts
which
had
frequently
flashed
through
my
soul
and
died
away
for
want
of
utterance
the
mighty
power
and
directness
of
truth
penetrating
even
the
heart
of
a
slaveholder
compelling
him
to
yield
up
his
earthly
interests
to
the
claims
of
eternal
justice
were
finely
illustrated
in
the
dialogue
just
referred
to
and
from
the
speeches
of
sheridan
i
got
a
bold
and
powerful
denunciation
of
oppression
and
a
most
brilliant
vindication
of
the
rights
of
man
here
was
indeed
a
noble
acquisition
if
i
ever
wavered
under
the
consideration
that
the
almighty
in
some
way
ordained
slavery
and
willed
my
enslavement
for
his
own
glory
i
wavered
no
longer
i
had
now
penetrated
the
secret
of
all
slavery
and
oppression
and
had
ascertained
their
true
foundation
to
be
in
the
pride
the
power
and
the
avarice
of
man
the
dialogue
and
the
speeches
were
all
redolent
of
the
principles
of
liberty
and
poured
floods
of
light
on
the
nature
and
character
of
slavery
with
a
book
of
this
kind
in
my
hand
my
own
human
nature
and
the
facts
of
my
experience
to
help
me
i
was
equal
to
a
contest
with
the
religious
advocates
of
slavery
whether
among
the
whites
or
among
the
colored
people
for
blindness
in
this
matter
is
not
confined
to
the
former
i
have
met
many
religious
colored
people
at
the
south
who
are
under
the
delusion
that
god
requires
them
to
submit
to
slavery
and
to
wear
their
chains
with
meekness
and
humility
i
could
entertain
no
such
nonsense
as
this
and
i
almost
lost
my
patience
when
i
found
any
colored
man
weak
enough
to
believe
such
stuff
nevertheless
the
increase
of
knowledge
was
attended
with
bitter
as
well
as
sweet
results
the
more
i
read
the
more
i
was
led
to
abhor
and
detest
slavery
and
my
enslavers
slaveholders
thought
i
are
only
a
band
of
successful
robbers
who
left
their
homes
and
went
into
africa
for
the
purpose
of
stealing
and
reducing
my
people
to
i
loathed
them
as
the
meanest
and
the
most
wicked
of
men
as
i
read
behold
the
very
discontent
so
graphically
pre
dicted
by
master
hugh
had
already
come
upon
me
i
was
no
longer
the
gleesome
boy
full
of
mirth
and
play
as
when
i
landed
first
at
baltimore
knowledge
had
come
light
had
penetrated
the
moral
dungeon
where
i
dwelt
and
behold
there
lay
the
bloody
whip
for
my
back
and
here
was
the
iron
chain
and
my
good
he
was
the
author
of
my
situation
the
revelation
haunted
me
stung
me
and
made
me
gloomy
and
miserable
as
i
writhed
under
the
sting
and
torment
of
this
knowledge
i
almost
envied
my
fellow
slaves
their
stupid
contentment
this
knowledge
opened
my
eyes
to
the
horrible
pit
and
revealed
the
teeth
of
the
frightful
dragon
that
was
ready
to
pounce
upon
me
but
it
opened
no
way
for
my
escape
i
have
often
wished
myself
a
beast
or
a
bird
anything
rather
than
a
slave
i
was
wretched
and
gloomy
beyond
my
ability
to
describe
i
was
too
thoughtful
to
be
happy
it
was
this
everlasting
thinking
which
distressed
and
tormented
me
and
yet
there
was
no
getting
rid
of
the
subject
of
my
thoughts
all
nature
was
redolent
of
it
once
awakened
by
the
silver
trump
of
knowledge
my
spirit
was
roused
to
eternal
wakefulness
liberty
the
inestimable
birthright
of
every
man
had
for
me
converted
every
object
into
an
asserter
of
this
great
right
it
was
heard
in
every
sound
and
beheld
in
every
object
it
was
ever
present
to
torment
me
with
a
sense
of
my
wretched
condition
the
more
beautiful
and
charming
were
the
smiles
of
nature
the
more
horrible
and
desolate
was
my
condition
i
saw
nothing
without
seeing
it
and
i
heard
nothing
without
hearing
it
i
do
not
exaggerate
when
i
say
that
it
looked
from
every
star
smiled
in
every
calm
breathed
in
every
wind
and
moved
in
every
storm
i
have
no
doubt
that
my
state
of
mind
had
something
to
do
with
the
change
in
the
treatment
adopted
by
my
once
kind
mistress
toward
me
i
can
easily
believe
that
my
leaden
downcast
and
discontented
look
was
very
offensive
to
her
poor
lady
she
did
not
know
my
trouble
and
i
dared
not
tell
her
could
i
have
freely
made
her
acquainted
with
the
real
state
of
my
mind
and
given
her
the
reasons
therefor
it
might
have
been
well
for
both
of
us
her
abuse
of
me
fell
upon
me
like
the
blows
of
the
false
prophet
upon
his
ass
she
did
not
know
that
an
stood
in
the
way
and
such
is
the
relation
of
master
and
slave
i
could
not
tell
her
nature
had
made
us
slavery
made
us
my
interests
were
in
a
direction
opposite
to
hers
and
we
both
had
our
private
thoughts
and
plans
she
aimed
to
keep
me
ignorant
and
i
resolved
to
know
although
knowledge
only
increased
my
discontent
my
feelings
were
not
the
result
of
any
marked
cruelty
in
the
treatment
i
received
they
sprung
from
the
consideration
of
my
being
a
slave
at
all
it
was
not
its
mere
that
i
hated
i
had
been
cheated
i
saw
through
the
attempt
to
keep
me
in
ignorance
i
saw
that
slaveholders
would
have
gladly
made
me
believe
that
they
were
merely
acting
under
the
authority
of
god
in
making
a
slave
of
me
and
in
making
slaves
of
others
and
i
treated
them
as
robbers
and
deceivers
the
feeding
and
clothing
me
well
could
not
atone
for
taking
my
liberty
from
me
the
smiles
of
my
mistress
could
not
remove
the
deep
sorrow
that
dwelt
in
my
young
bosom
indeed
these
in
time
came
only
to
deepen
my
sorrow
she
had
changed
and
the
reader
will
see
that
i
had
changed
too
we
were
both
victims
to
the
same
overshadowing
evil
as
mistress
i
as
slave
i
will
not
censure
her
harshly
she
can
not
censure
me
for
she
knows
i
speak
but
the
truth
and
have
acted
in
my
opposition
to
slavery
just
as
she
herself
would
have
acted
in
a
reverse
of
circumstances

were

whilst
in

painful
state
of
mind
described
in
the

chapter
almost
regretting
my
very
existence
because
doomed
to
a
life
of
bondage
so
goaded
and
so
wretched
at
times
that
i
was
even
tempted
to
destroy
my
own
life
i
was
keenly
sensitive
and
eager
to
know
any
and
every
thing
that
transpired
having
any
relation
to
the
subject
of
slavery
i
was
all
ears
all
eyes
whenever
the
words
dropped
from
the
lips
of
any
white
person
and
the
occasions
were
not
unfrequent
when
these
words
became
leading
ones
in
high
social
debate
at
our
house
every
little
while
i
could
hear
master
hugh
or
some
of
his
company
speaking
with
much
warmth
and
excitement
about
of
or
these
were
i
was
totally
ignorant
i
found
however
that
whatever
they
might
be
they
were
most
cordially
hated
and
soundly
abused
by
slaveholders
of
every
grade
i
very
soon
discovered
too
that
slavery
was
in
some
sort
under
consideration
whenever
the
abolitionists
were
alluded
to
this
made
the
term
a
very
interesting
one
to
me
if
a
slave
for
instance
had
made
good
his
escape
from
slavery
it
was
generally
alleged
that
he
had
been
persuaded
and
assisted
by
the
abolitionists
if
also
a
slave
killed
his
master
as
was
sometimes
the
case
or
struck
down
his
overseer
or
set
fire
to
his
master
s
dwelling
or
committed
any
violence
or
crime
out
of
the
common
way
it
was
certain
to
be
said
that
such
a
crime
was
the
legitimate
fruits
of
the
abolition
movement
hearing
such
charges
often
repeated
i
naturally
enough
received
the
impression
that
abolition
whatever
else
it
might
be
could
not
be
unfriendly
to
the
slave
nor
very
friendly
to
the
slaveholder
i
therefore
set
about
finding
out
if
possible
and
the
abolitionists
were
and
they
were
so
obnoxious
to
the
slaveholders
the
dictionary
afforded
me
very
little
help
it
taught
me
that
abolition
was
the
act
of
abolishing
but
it
left
me
in
ignorance
at
the
very
point
where
i
most
wanted
information
and
that
was
as
to
the
to
be
abolished
a
city
newspaper
the
gave
me
the
incendiary
information
denied
me
by
the
dictionary
in
its
columns
i
found
that
on
a
certain
day
a
vast
number
of
petitions
and
memorials
had
been
presented
to
congress
praying
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
for
the
abolition
of
the
slave
trade
between
the
states
of
the
union
this
was
enough
the
vindictive
bitterness
the
marked
caution
the
studied
reverse
and
the
cumbrous
ambiguity
practiced
by
our
white
folks
when
alluding
to
this
subject
was
now
fully
explained
ever
after
that
when
i
heard
the
words
abolition
or
abolition
movement
mentioned
i
felt
the
matter
one
of
a
personal
concern
and
i
drew
near
to
listen
when
i
could
do
so
without
seeming
too
solicitous
and
prying
there
was
hope
in
those
words
ever
and
anon
too
i
could
see
some
terrible
denunciation
of
slavery
in
our
papers
copied
from
abolition
papers
at
the
north
and
the
injustice
of
such
denunciation
commented
on
these
i
read
with
avidity
i
had
a
deep
satisfaction
in
the
thought
that
the
rascality
of
slaveholders
was
not
concealed
from
the
eyes
of
the
world
and
that
i
was
not
alone
in
abhorring
the
cruelty
and
brutality
of
slavery
a
still
deeper
train
of
thought
was
stirred
i
saw
that
there
was
as
well
as
in
the
manner
of
speaking
of
the
abolitionists
the
latter
therefore
i
was
compelled
to
regard
as
having
some
power
in
the
country
and
i
felt
that
they
might
possibly
succeed
in
their
designs
when
i
met
with
a
slave
to
whom
i
deemed
it
safe
to
talk
on
the
subject
i
would
impart
to
him
so
much
of
the
mystery
as
i
had
been
able
to
penetrate
thus
the
light
of
this
grand
movement
broke
in
upon
my
mind
by
degrees
and
i
must
say
that
ignorant
as
i
then
was
of
the
philosophy
of
that
movement
i
believe
in
it
from
the
first
and
i
believed
in
it
partly
because
i
saw
that
it
alarmed
the
consciences
of
slaveholders
the
insurrection
of
nathaniel
turner
had
been
quelled
but
the
alarm
and
terror
had
not
subsided
the
cholera
was
on
its
way
and
the
thought
was
present
that
god
was
angry
with
the
white
people
because
of
their
slaveholding
wickedness
and
therefore
his
judgments
were
abroad
in
the
land
it
was
impossible
for
me
not
to
hope
much
from
the
abolition
movement
when
i
saw
it
supported
by
the
almighty
and
armed
with
death
previous
to
my
contemplation
of
the
movement
and
its
probable
results
my
mind
had
been
seriously
awakened
to
the
subject
of
religion
i
was
not
more
than
thirteen
years
old
when
i
felt
the
need
of
god
as
a
father
and
protector
my
religious
nature
was
awakened
by
the
preaching
of
a
white
methodist
minister
named
hanson
he
thought
that
all
men
great
and
small
bond
and
free
were
sinners
in
the
sight
of
god
that
they
were
by
nature
rebels
against
his
government
and
that
they
must
repent
of
their
sins
and
be
reconciled
to
god
through
christ
i
can
not
say
that
i
had
a
very
distinct
notion
of
what
was
required
of
me
but
one
thing
i
knew
very
well
i
was
wretched
and
had
no
means
of
making
myself
otherwise
moreover
i
knew
that
i
could
pray
for
light
i
consulted
a
good
colored
man
named
charles
johnson
and
in
tones
of
holy
affection
he
told
me
to
pray
and
what
to
pray
for
i
was
for
weeks
a
poor
brokenhearted
mourner
traveling
through
the
darkness
and
misery
of
doubts
and
fears
i
finally
found
that
change
of
heart
which
comes
by
casting
all
one
s
care
upon
god
and
by
having
faith
in
jesus
christ
as
the
redeemer
friend
and
savior
of
those
who
diligently
seek
him
after
this
i
saw
the
world
in
a
new
light
i
seemed
to
live
in
a
new
world
surrounded
by
new
objects
and
to
be
animated
by
new
hopes
and
desires
i
loved
all
mankind
slaveholders
not
excepted
though
i
abhorred
slavery
more
than
ever
my
great
concern
was
now
to
have
the
world
converted
the
desire
for
knowledge
increased
and
especially
did
i
want
a
thorough
acquaintance
with
the
contents
of
the
bible
i
have
gathered
scattered
pages
from
this
holy
book
from
the
filthy
street
gutters
of
baltimore
and
washed
and
dried
them
that
in
the
moments
of
my
leisure
i
might
get
a
word
or
two
of
wisdom
from
them
while
thus
religiously
seeking
knowledge
i
became
acquainted
with
a
good
old
colored
man
named
lawson
a
more
devout
man
than
he
i
never
saw
he
drove
a
dray
for
james
ramsey
the
owner
of
a
on
fell
s
point
baltimore
this
man
not
only
prayed
three
time
a
day
but
he
prayed
as
he
walked
through
the
streets
at
his
work
on
his
dray
everywhere
his
life
was
a
life
of
prayer
and
his
words
when
he
spoke
to
his
friends
were
about
a
better
world
uncle
lawson
lived
near
master
hugh
s
house
and
becoming
deeply
attached
to
the
old
man
i
went
often
with
him
to
and
spent
much
of
my
leisure
time
with
him
on
sunday
the
old
man
could
read
a
little
and
i
was
a
great
help
to
him
in
making
out
the
hard
words
for
i
was
a
better
reader
than
he
i
could
teach
him
the
letter
but
he
could
teach
me
the
spirit
and
high
refreshing
times
we
had
together
in
singing
praying
and
glorifying
god
these
meetings
with
uncle
lawson
went
on
for
a
long
time
without
the
knowledge
of
master
hugh
or
my
mistress
both
knew
how
ever
that
i
had
become
religious
and
they
seemed
to
respect
my
conscientious
piety
my
mistress
was
still
a
professor
of
religion
and
belonged
to
class
her
leader
was
no
less
a
person
than
the
rev
beverly
waugh
the
presiding
elder
and
now
one
of
the
bishops
of
the
methodist
episcopal
church
waugh
was
then
stationed
over
wilk
street
church
i
am
careful
to
state
these
facts
that
the
reader
may
be
able
to
form
an
idea
of
the
precise
influences
which
had
to
do
with
shaping
and
directing
my
mind
in
view
of
the
cares
and
anxieties
incident
to
the
life
she
was
then
leading
and
especially
in
view
of
the
separation
from
religious
associations
to
which
she
was
subjected
my
mistress
had
as
i
have
before
stated
become
lukewarm
and
needed
to
be
looked
up
by
her
leader
this
brought
waugh
to
our
house
and
gave
me
an
opportunity
to
hear
him
exhort
and
pray
but
my
chief
instructor
in
matters
of
religion
was
uncle
lawson
he
was
my
spiritual
father
and
i
loved
him
intensely
and
was
at
his
house
every
chance
i
got
this
pleasure
was
not
long
allowed
me
master
hugh
became
averse
to
my
going
to
father
lawson
s
and
threatened
to
whip
me
if
i
ever
went
there
again
i
now
felt
myself
persecuted
by
a
wicked
man
and
i
go
to
father
lawson
s
notwithstanding
the
threat
the
good
old
man
had
told
me
that
the
lord
had
a
great
work
for
me
to
do
and
i
must
prepare
to
do
it
and
that
he
had
been
shown
that
i
must
preach
the
gospel
his
words
made
a
deep
impression
on
my
mind
and
i
verily
felt
that
some
such
work
was
before
me
though
i
could
not
see
i
should
ever
engage
in
its
performance
the
good
lord
he
said
would
bring
it
to
pass
in
his
own
good
time
and
that
i
must
go
on
reading
and
studying
the
scriptures
the
advice
and
the
suggestions
of
uncle
lawson
were
not
without
their
influence
upon
my
character
and
destiny
he
threw
my
thoughts
into
a
channel
from
which
they
have
never
entirely
diverged
he
fanned
my
already
intense
love
of
knowledge
into
a
flame
by
assuring
me
that
i
was
to
be
a
useful
man
in
the
world
when
i
would
say
to
him
how
can
these
things
be
and
what
can
do
his
simple
reply
was
trust
in
the
when
i
told
him
that
i
was
a
slave
and
a
slave
for
life
he
said
the
lord
can
make
you
free
my
dear
all
things
are
possible
with
him
only
faith
in
ask
and
it
shall
be
if
you
want
liberty
said
the
good
old
man
ask
the
lord
for
it
and
he
will
give
it
to
thus
assured
and
cheered
on
under
the
inspiration
of
hope
i
worked
and
prayed
with
a
light
heart
believing
that
my
life
was
under
the
guidance
of
a
wisdom
higher
than
my
own
with
all
other
blessings
sought
at
the
mercy
seat
i
always
prayed
that
god
would
of
his
great
mercy
and
in
his
own
good
time
deliver
me
from
my
bondage
i
went
one
day
on
the
wharf
of
mr
waters
and
seeing
two
irishmen
unloading
a
large
scow
of
stone
or
ballast
i
went
on
board
unasked
and
helped
them
when
we
had
finished
the
work
one
of
the
men
came
to
me
aside
and
asked
me
a
number
of
questions
and
among
them
if
i
were
a
slave
i
told
him
i
was
a
slave
and
a
slave
for
the
good
irishman
gave
his
shoulders
a
shrug
and
seemed
deeply
affected
by
the
statement
he
said
it
was
a
pity
so
fine
a
little
fellow
as
myself
should
be
a
slave
for
they
both
had
much
to
say
about
the
matter
and
expressed
the
deepest
sympathy
with
me
and
the
most
decided
hatred
of
slavery
they
went
so
far
as
to
tell
me
that
i
ought
to
run
away
and
go
to
the
north
that
i
should
find
friends
there
and
that
i
would
be
as
free
as
anybody
i
however
pretended
not
to
be
interested
in
what
they
said
for
i
feared
they
might
be
treacherous
white
men
have
been
known
to
encourage
slaves
to
escape
and
then
to
get
the
reward
they
have
kidnapped
them
and
returned
them
to
their
masters
and
while
i
mainly
inclined
to
the
notion
that
these
men
were
honest
and
meant
me
no
ill
i
feared
it
might
be
otherwise
i
nevertheless
remembered
their
words
and
their
advice
and
looked
forward
to
an
escape
to
the
north
as
a
possible
means
of
gaining
the
liberty
for
which
my
heart
panted
it
was
not
my
enslavement
at
the
then
present
time
that
most
affected
me
the
being
a
slave
was
the
saddest
thought
i
was
too
young
to
think
of
running
away
immediately
besides
i
wished
to
learn
how
to
write
before
going
as
i
might
have
occasion
to
write
my
own
pass
i
now
not
only
had
the
hope
of
freedom
but
a
foreshadowing
of
the
means
by
which
i
might
some
day
gain
that
inestimable
boon
meanwhile
i
resolved
to
add
to
my
educational
attainments
the
art
of
writing
after
this
manner
i
began
to
learn
to
write
i
was
much
in
the
ship
yard
master
hugh
s
and
that
of
durgan
bailey
and
i
observed
that
the
carpenters
after
hewing
and
getting
a
piece
of
timber
ready
for
use
wrote
on
it
the
initials
of
the
name
of
that
part
of
the
ship
for
which
it
was
intended
when
for
instance
a
piece
of
timber
was
ready
for
the
starboard
side
it
was
marked
with
a
capital
a
piece
for
the
larboard
side
was
marked
l
larboard
forward
l
larboard
aft
was
marked
l
starboard
aft
s
and
starboard
forward
s
i
soon
learned
these
letters
and
for
what
they
were
placed
on
the
timbers
my
work
was
now
to
keep
fire
under
the
steam
box
and
to
watch
the
ship
yard
while
the
carpenters
had
gone
to
dinner
this
interval
gave
me
a
fine
opportunity
for
copying
the
letters
named
i
soon
astonished
myself
with
the
ease
with
which
i
made
the
letters
and
the
thought
was
soon
present
if
i
can
make
four
i
can
make
but
having
made
these
easily
when
i
met
boys
about
bethel
church
or
any
of
our
i
entered
the
lists
with
them
in
the
art
of
writing
and
would
make
the
letters
which
i
had
been
so
fortunate
as
to
learn
and
ask
them
to
beat
that
if
they
with
playmates
for
my
teachers
fences
and
pavements
for
my
copy
books
and
chalk
for
my
pen
and
ink
i
learned
the
art
of
writing
i
however
afterward
adopted
various
methods
of
improving
my
hand
the
most
successful
was
copying
the
in
webster
s
spelling
book
until
i
could
make
them
all
without
looking
on
the
book
by
this
time
my
little
master
tommy
had
grown
to
be
a
big
boy
and
had
written
over
a
number
of
copy
books
and
brought
them
home
they
had
been
shown
to
the
neighbors
had
elicited
due
praise
and
were
now
laid
carefully
away
spending
my
time
between
the
ship
yard
and
house
i
was
as
often
the
lone
keeper
of
the
latter
as
of
the
former
when
my
mistress
left
me
in
charge
of
the
house
i
had
a
grand
time
i
got
master
tommy
s
copy
books
and
a
pen
and
ink
and
in
the
ample
spaces
between
the
lines
i
wrote
other
lines
as
nearly
like
his
as
possible
the
process
was
a
tedious
one
and
i
ran
the
risk
of
getting
a
flogging
for
marring
the
highly
prized
copy
books
of
the
oldest
son
in
addition
to
those
opportunities
sleeping
as
i
did
in
the
kitchen
loft
a
room
seldom
visited
by
any
of
the
family
i
got
a
flour
barrel
up
there
and
a
chair
and
upon
the
head
of
that
barrel
i
have
written
or
endeavored
to
write
copying
from
the
bible
and
the
methodist
hymn
book
and
other
books
which
had
accumulated
on
my
hands
till
late
at
night
and
when
all
the
family
were
in
bed
and
asleep
i
was
supported
in
my
endeavors
by
renewed
advice
and
by
holy
promises
from
the
good
father
lawson
with
whom
i
continued
to
meet
and
pray
and
read
the
scriptures
although
master
hugh
was
aware
of
my
going
there
i
must
say
for
his
credit
that
he
never
executed
his
threat
to
whip
me
for
having
thus
innocently
leisure

s
reasons
for
regretting
the
change
a
plan
of
escape
entertained
i
must
now
ask
the
reader
to
go
with
me
a
little
back
in
point
of
time
in
my
humble
story
and
to
notice
another
circumstance
that
entered
into
my
slavery
experience
and
which
doubtless
has
had
a
share
in
deepening
my
horror
of
slavery
and
increasing
my
hostility
toward
those
men
and
measures
that
practically
uphold
the
slave
system
it
has
already
been
observed
that
though
i
was
after
my
removal
from
lloyd
s
plantation
in
the
slave
of
master
hugh
i
was
in
and
in
the
slave
of
my
old
master
capt
anthony
very
well
in
a
very
short
time
after
i
went
to
baltimore
my
old
master
s
youngest
son
richard
died
and
in
three
years
and
six
months
after
his
death
my
old
master
himself
died
leaving
only
his
son
andrew
and
his
daughter
lucretia
to
share
his
estate
the
old
man
died
while
on
a
visit
to
his
daughter
in
hillsborough
where
capt
auld
and
lucretia
now
lived
the
former
having
given
up
the
command
of
lloyd
s
sloop
was
now
keeping
a
store
in
that
town
cut
off
thus
unexpectedly
capt
anthony
died
intestate
and
his
property
must
now
be
equally
divided
between
his
two
children
andrew
and
lucretia
the
valuation
and
the
division
of
slaves
among
contending
heirs
is
an
important
incident
in
slave
life
the
character
and
tendencies
of
the
heirs
are
generally
well
understood
among
the
slaves
who
are
to
be
divided
and
all
have
their
aversions
and
preferences
but
neither
their
aversions
nor
their
preferences
avail
them
anything
on
the
death
of
old
master
i
was
immediately
sent
for
to
be
valued
and
divided
with
the
other
property
personally
my
concern
was
mainly
about
my
possible
removal
from
the
home
of
master
hugh
which
after
that
of
my
grandmother
was
the
most
endeared
to
me
but
the
whole
thing
as
a
feature
of
slavery
shocked
me
it
furnished
me
anew
insight
into
the
unnatural
power
to
which
i
was
subjected
my
detestation
of
slavery
already
great
rose
with
this
new
conception
of
its
enormity
that
was
a
sad
day
for
me
a
sad
day
for
little
tommy
and
a
sad
day
for
my
dear
baltimore
mistress
and
teacher
when
i
left
for
the
eastern
shore
to
be
valued
and
divided
we
all
three
wept
bitterly
that
day
for
we
might
be
parting
and
we
feared
we
were
parting
forever
no
one
could
tell
among
which
pile
of
chattels
i
should
be
flung
thus
early
i
got
a
foretaste
of
that
painful
uncertainty
which
slavery
brings
to
the
ordinary
lot
of
mortals
sickness
adversity
and
death
may
interfere
with
the
plans
and
purposes
of
all
but
the
slave
has
the
added
danger
of
changing
homes
changing
hands
and
of
having
separations
unknown
to
other
men
then
too
there
was
the
intensified
degradation
of
the
spectacle
what
an
assemblage
men
and
women
young
and
old
married
and
single
moral
and
intellectual
beings
in
open
contempt
of
their
humanity
level
at
a
blow
with
horses
sheep
horned
cattle
and
swine
horses
and
men
cattle
and
women
pigs
and
children
all
holding
the
same
rank
in
the
scale
of
social
existence
and
all
subjected
to
the
same
narrow
inspection
to
ascertain
their
value
in
gold
and
silver
the
only
standard
of
worth
applied
by
slaveholders
to
slaves
how
vividly
at
that
moment
did
the
brutalizing
power
of
slavery
flash
before
me
personality
swallowed
up
in
the
sordid
idea
of
property
manhood
lost
in
chattelhood
after
the
valuation
then
came
the
division
this
was
an
hour
of
high
excitement
and
distressing
anxiety
our
destiny
was
now
to
be
for
and
we
had
no
more
voice
in
the
decision
of
the
question
than
the
oxen
and
cows
that
stood
chewing
at
the
haymow
one
word
from
the
appraisers
against
all
preferences
or
prayers
was
enough
to
sunder
all
the
ties
of
friendship
and
affection
and
even
to
separate
husbands
and
wives
parents
and
children
we
were
all
appalled
before
that
power
which
to
human
seeming
could
bless
or
blast
us
in
a
moment
added
to
the
dread
of
separation
most
painful
to
the
majority
of
the
slaves
we
all
had
a
decided
horror
of
the
thought
of
falling
into
the
hands
of
master
andrew
he
was
distinguished
for
cruelty
and
intemperance
slaves
generally
dread
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
drunken
owners
master
andrew
was
almost
a
confirmed
sot
and
had
already
by
his
reckless
mismanagement
and
profligate
dissipation
wasted
a
large
portion
of
old
master
s
property
to
fall
into
his
hands
was
therefore
considered
merely
as
the
first
step
toward
being
sold
away
to
the
far
south
he
would
spend
his
fortune
in
a
few
years
and
his
farms
and
slaves
would
be
sold
we
thought
at
public
outcry
and
we
should
be
hurried
away
to
the
cotton
fields
and
rice
swamps
of
the
sunny
south
this
was
the
cause
of
deep
consternation
the
people
of
the
north
and
free
people
generally
i
think
have
less
attachment
to
the
places
where
they
are
born
and
brought
up
than
have
the
slaves
their
freedom
to
go
and
come
to
be
here
and
there
as
they
list
prevents
any
extravagant
attachment
to
any
one
particular
place
in
their
case
on
the
other
hand
the
slave
is
a
fixture
he
has
no
choice
no
goal
no
destination
but
is
pegged
down
to
a
single
spot
and
must
take
root
here
or
nowhere
the
idea
of
removal
elsewhere
comes
generally
in
the
shape
of
a
threat
and
in
punishment
of
crime
it
is
therefore
attended
with
fear
and
dread
a
slave
seldom
thinks
of
bettering
his
condition
by
being
sold
and
hence
he
looks
upon
separation
from
his
native
place
with
none
of
the
enthusiasm
which
animates
the
bosoms
of
young
freemen
when
they
contemplate
a
life
in
the
far
west
or
in
some
distant
country
where
they
intend
to
rise
to
wealth
and
distinction
nor
can
those
from
whom
they
separate
give
them
up
with
that
cheerfulness
with
which
friends
and
relations
yield
each
other
up
when
they
feel
that
it
is
for
the
good
of
the
departing
one
that
he
is
removed
from
his
native
place
then
too
there
is
correspondence
and
there
is
at
least
the
hope
of
reunion
because
reunion
is
but
with
the
slave
all
these
mitigating
circumstances
are
wanting
there
is
no
improvement
in
his
condition
no
correspondence
no
reunion
attainable
his
going
out
into
the
world
is
like
a
living
man
going
into
the
tomb
who
with
open
eyes
sees
himself
buried
out
of
sight
and
hearing
of
wife
children
and
friends
of
kindred
tie
in
contemplating
the
likelihoods
and
possibilities
of
our
circumstances
i
probably
suffered
more
than
most
of
my
fellow
servants
i
had
known
what
it
was
to
experience
kind
and
even
tender
treatment
they
had
known
nothing
of
the
sort
life
to
them
had
been
rough
and
thorny
as
well
as
dark
they
had
most
of
them
lived
on
my
old
master
s
farm
in
tuckahoe
and
had
felt
the
reign
of
plummer
s
rule
the
overseer
had
written
his
character
on
the
living
parchment
of
most
of
their
backs
and
left
them
callous
my
back
thanks
to
my
early
removal
from
the
plantation
to
baltimore
was
yet
tender
i
had
left
a
kind
mistress
at
baltimore
who
was
almost
a
mother
to
me
she
was
in
tears
when
we
parted
and
the
probabilities
of
ever
seeing
her
again
trembling
in
the
balance
as
they
did
could
not
be
viewed
without
alarm
and
agony
the
thought
of
leaving
that
kind
mistress
forever
and
worse
still
of
being
the
slave
of
andrew
anthony
a
man
who
but
a
few
days
before
the
division
of
the
property
had
in
my
presence
seized
my
brother
perry
by
the
throat
dashed
him
on
the
ground
and
with
the
heel
of
his
boot
stamped
him
on
the
head
until
the
blood
gushed
from
his
nose
and
ears
was
terrible
this
fiendish
proceeding
had
no
better
apology
than
the
fact
that
perry
had
gone
to
play
when
master
andrew
wanted
him
for
some
trifling
service
this
cruelty
too
was
of
a
piece
with
his
general
character
after
inflicting
his
heavy
blows
on
my
brother
on
observing
me
looking
at
him
with
intense
astonishment
he
said
is
the
way
i
will
serve
you
one
of
these
days
meaning
no
doubt
when
i
should
come
into
his
possession
this
threat
the
reader
may
well
suppose
was
not
very
tranquilizing
to
my
feelings
i
could
see
that
he
really
thirsted
to
get
hold
of
me
but
i
was
there
only
for
a
few
days
i
had
not
received
any
orders
and
had
violated
none
and
there
was
therefore
no
excuse
for
flogging
me
at
last
the
anxiety
and
suspense
were
ended
and
they
ended
thanks
to
a
kind
providence
in
accordance
with
my
wishes
i
fell
to
the
portion
of
lucretia
the
dear
lady
who
bound
up
my
head
when
the
savage
aunt
katy
was
adding
to
my
sufferings
her
bitterest
maledictions
capt
thomas
auld
and
lucretia
at
once
decided
on
my
return
to
baltimore
they
knew
how
sincerely
and
warmly
hugh
auld
was
attached
to
me
and
how
delighted
hugh
s
son
would
be
to
have
me
back
and
withal
having
no
immediate
use
for
one
so
young
they
willingly
let
me
off
to
baltimore
i
need
not
stop
here
to
narrate
my
joy
on
returning
to
baltimore
nor
that
of
little
tommy
nor
the
tearful
joy
of
his
mother
nor
the
evident
saticfaction
sic
of
master
hugh
i
was
just
one
month
absent
from
baltimore
before
the
matter
was
decided
and
the
time
really
seemed
full
six
months
one
trouble
over
and
on
comes
another
the
slave
s
life
is
full
of
uncertainty
i
had
returned
to
baltimore
but
a
short
time
when
the
tidings
reached
me
that
my
friend
lucretia
who
was
only
second
in
my
regard
to
hugh
auld
was
dead
leaving
her
husband
and
only
one
child
a
daughter
named
amanda
shortly
after
the
death
of
lucretia
strange
to
say
master
andrew
died
leaving
his
wife
and
one
child
thus
the
whole
family
of
anthonys
was
swept
away
only
two
children
remained
all
this
happened
within
five
years
of
my
leaving
lloyd
s
no
alteration
took
place
in
the
condition
of
the
slaves
in
consequence
of
these
deaths
yet
i
could
not
help
feeling
less
secure
after
the
death
of
my
friend
lucretia
than
i
had
done
during
her
life
while
she
lived
i
felt
that
i
had
a
strong
friend
to
plead
for
me
in
any
emergency
ten
years
ago
while
speaking
of
the
state
of
things
in
our
family
after
the
events
just
named
i
used
this
language
now
all
the
property
of
my
old
master
slaves
included
was
in
the
hands
of
strangers
strangers
who
had
nothing
to
do
in
accumulating
it
not
a
slave
was
left
free
all
remained
slaves
from
youngest
to
oldest
if
any
one
thing
in
my
experience
more
than
another
served
to
deepen
my
conviction
of
the
infernal
character
of
slavery
and
to
fill
me
with
unutterable
loathing
of
slaveholders
it
was
their
base
ingratitude
to
my
poor
old
grandmother
she
had
served
my
old
master
faithfully
from
youth
to
old
age
she
had
been
the
source
of
all
his
wealth
she
had
peopled
his
plantation
with
slaves
she
had
become
a
in
his
service
she
had
rocked
him
in
infancy
attended
him
in
childhood
served
him
through
life
and
at
his
death
wiped
from
his
icy
brow
the
cold
and
closed
his
eyes
forever
she
was
nevertheless
left
a
slave
a
slave
for
life
a
slave
in
the
hands
of
strangers
and
in
their
hands
she
saw
her
children
her
grandchildren
and
her
divided
like
so
many
sheep
without
being
gratified
with
the
small
privilege
of
a
single
word
as
to
their
or
her
own
destiny
and
to
cap
the
climax
of
their
base
ingratitude
and
fiendish
barbarity
my
grandmother
who
was
now
very
old
having
outlived
my
old
master
and
all
his
children
having
seen
the
beginning
and
end
of
all
of
them
and
her
present
owners
finding
she
was
of
but
little
value
her
frame
already
racked
with
the
pains
of
old
age
and
complete
helplessness
fast
stealing
over
her
once
active
limbs
they
took
her
to
the
woods
built
her
a
little
hut
put
up
a
little
and
then
made
her
welcome
to
the
privilege
of
supporting
herself
there
in
perfect
loneliness
thus
virtually
turning
her
out
to
die
if
my
poor
old
grandmother
now
lives
she
lives
to
suffer
in
utter
loneliness
she
lives
to
remember
and
mourn
over
the
loss
of
children
the
loss
of
grandchildren
and
the
loss
of
they
are
in
the
language
of
the
slave
s
poet
whittier
gone
sold
and
gone
to
the
rice
swamp
dank
and
lone
where
the
ceaseless
swings
where
the
noisome
insect
stings
where
the
strews
poison
with
the
falling
dews
where
the
sickly
sunbeams
glare
through
the
hot
and
misty
air
gone
gone
sold
and
gone
to
the
rice
swamp
dank
and
lone
from
virginia
hills
and
waters
woe
is
me
my
stolen
the
hearth
is
desolate
the
children
the
unconscious
children
who
once
sang
and
danced
in
her
presence
are
gone
she
gropes
her
way
in
the
darkness
of
age
for
a
drink
of
water
instead
of
the
voices
of
her
children
she
hears
by
day
the
moans
of
the
dove
and
by
night
the
screams
of
the
hideous
owl
all
is
gloom
the
grave
is
at
the
door
and
now
when
weighed
down
by
the
pains
and
aches
of
old
age
when
the
head
inclines
to
the
feet
when
the
beginning
and
ending
of
human
existence
meet
and
helpless
infancy
and
painful
old
age
combine
together
at
this
time
this
most
needful
time
the
time
for
the
exercise
of
that
tenderness
and
affection
which
children
only
can
exercise
toward
a
declining
parent
my
poor
old
grandmother
the
devoted
mother
of
twelve
children
is
left
all
alone
in
yonder
little
hut
before
a
few
dim
embers
two
years
after
the
death
of
lucretia
master
thomas
married
his
second
wife
her
name
was
rowena
hamilton
the
eldest
daughter
of
william
hamilton
a
rich
slaveholder
on
the
eastern
shore
of
maryland
who
lived
about
five
miles
from
michael
s
the
then
place
of
my
master
s
residence
not
long
after
his
marriage
master
thomas
had
a
misunderstanding
with
master
hugh
and
as
a
means
of
punishing
his
brother
he
ordered
him
to
send
me
home
as
the
ground
of
misunderstanding
will
serve
to
illustrate
the
character
of
southern
chivalry
and
humanity
i
will
relate
it
among
the
children
of
my
aunt
milly
was
a
daughter
named
henny
when
quite
a
child
henny
had
fallen
into
the
fire
and
burnt
her
hands
so
bad
that
they
were
of
very
little
use
to
her
her
fingers
were
drawn
almost
into
the
palms
of
her
hands
she
could
make
out
to
do
something
but
she
was
considered
hardly
worth
the
having
of
little
more
value
than
a
horse
with
a
broken
leg
this
unprofitable
piece
of
human
property
ill
shapen
and
disfigured
capt
auld
sent
off
to
baltimore
making
his
brother
hugh
welcome
to
her
services
after
giving
poor
henny
a
fair
trial
master
hugh
and
his
wife
came
to
the
conclusion
that
they
had
no
use
for
the
crippled
servant
and
they
sent
her
back
to
master
thomas
thus
the
latter
took
as
an
act
of
ingratitude
on
the
part
of
his
brother
and
as
a
mark
of
his
displeasure
he
required
him
to
send
me
immediately
to
michael
s
saying
if
he
can
not
keep
hen
he
shall
not
have
here
was
another
shock
to
my
nerves
another
breaking
up
of
my
plans
and
another
severance
of
my
religious
and
social
alliances
i
was
now
a
big
boy
i
had
become
quite
useful
to
several
young
colored
men
who
had
made
me
their
teacher
i
had
taught
some
of
them
to
read
and
was
accustomed
to
spend
many
of
my
leisure
hours
with
them
our
attachment
was
strong
and
i
greatly
dreaded
the
separation
but
regrets
especially
in
a
slave
are
unavailing
i
was
only
a
slave
my
wishes
were
nothing
and
my
happiness
was
the
sport
of
my
masters
my
regrets
at
now
leaving
baltimore
were
not
for
the
same
reasons
as
when
i
before
left
that
city
to
be
valued
and
handed
over
to
my
proper
owner
my
home
was
not
now
the
pleasant
place
it
had
formerly
been
a
change
had
taken
place
both
in
master
hugh
and
in
his
once
pious
and
affectionate
wife
the
influence
of
brandy
and
bad
company
on
him
and
the
influence
of
slavery
and
social
isolation
upon
her
had
wrought
disastrously
upon
the
characters
of
both
thomas
was
no
longer
little
tommy
but
was
a
big
boy
and
had
learned
to
assume
the
airs
of
his
class
toward
me
my
condition
therefore
in
the
house
of
master
hugh
was
not
by
any
means
so
comfortable
as
in
former
years
my
attachments
were
now
outside
of
our
family
they
were
felt
to
those
to
whom
i
instruction
and
to
those
little
white
boys
from
whom
i
instruction
there
too
was
my
dear
old
father
the
pious
lawson
who
was
in
christian
graces
the
very
counterpart
of
uncle
tom
the
resemblance
is
so
perfect
that
he
might
have
been
the
original
of
stowe
s
christian
hero
the
thought
of
leaving
these
dear
friends
greatly
troubled
me
for
i
was
going
without
the
hope
of
ever
returning
to
baltimore
again
the
feud
between
master
hugh
and
his
brother
being
bitter
and
irreconcilable
or
at
least
supposed
to
be
so
in
addition
to
thoughts
of
friends
from
whom
i
was
parting
as
i
supposed
i
had
the
grief
of
neglected
chances
of
escape
to
brood
over
i
had
put
off
running
away
until
now
i
was
to
be
placed
where
the
opportunities
for
escaping
were
much
fewer
than
in
a
large
city
like
baltimore
on
my
way
from
baltimore
to
michael
s
down
the
chesapeake
bay
our
sloop
the
amanda
was
passed
by
the
steamers
plying
between
that
city
and
philadelphia
and
i
watched
the
course
of
those
steamers
and
while
going
to
michael
s
i
formed
a
plan
to
escape
from
slavery
of
which
plan
and
matters
connected
therewith

kind

that
was
the
year
i
went
to
reside
there
enjoyed
some
reputation
as
a
ship
building
community
but
that
business
had
almost
entirely
given
place
to
oyster
fishing
for
the
baltimore
and
philadelphia
markets
a
course
of
life
highly
unfavorable
to
morals
industry
and
manners
miles
river
was
broad
and
its
oyster
fishing
grounds
were
extensive
and
the
fishermen
were
out
often
all
day
and
a
part
of
the
night
during
autumn
winter
and
spring
this
exposure
was
an
excuse
for
carrying
with
them
in
considerable
quanties
sic
spirituous
liquors
the
then
supposed
best
antidote
for
cold
each
canoe
was
supplied
with
its
jug
of
rum
and
tippling
among
this
class
of
the
citizens
of
michael
s
became
general
this
drinking
habit
in
an
ignorant
population
fostered
coarseness
vulgarity
and
an
indolent
disregard
for
the
social
improvement
of
the
place
so
that
it
was
admitted
by
the
few
sober
thinking
people
who
remained
there
that
michael
s
had
become
a
very
as
well
as
unsightly
place
before
i
went
there
to
reside
i
left
baltimore
for
michael
s
in
the
month
of
march
i
know
the
year
because
it
was
the
one
succeeding
the
first
cholera
in
baltimore
and
was
the
year
also
of
that
strange
phenomenon
when
the
heavens
seemed
about
to
part
with
its
starry
train
i
witnessed
this
gorgeous
spectacle
and
was
the
air
seemed
filled
with
bright
descending
messengers
from
the
sky
it
was
about
daybreak
when
i
saw
this
sublime
scene
i
was
not
without
the
suggestion
at
the
moment
that
it
might
be
the
harbinger
of
the
coming
of
the
son
of
man
and
in
my
then
state
of
mind
i
was
prepared
to
hail
him
as
my
friend
and
deliverer
i
had
read
that
the
stars
shall
fall
from
heaven
and
they
were
now
falling
i
was
suffering
much
in
my
mind
it
did
seem
that
every
time
the
young
tendrils
of
my
affection
became
attached
they
were
rudely
broken
by
some
unnatural
outside
power
and
i
was
beginning
to
look
away
to
heaven
for
the
rest
denied
me
on
earth
but
to
my
story
it
was
now
more
than
seven
years
since
i
had
lived
with
master
thomas
auld
in
the
family
of
my
old
master
on
lloyd
s
plantation
we
were
almost
entire
strangers
to
each
other
for
when
i
knew
him
at
the
house
of
my
old
master
it
was
not
as
a
but
simply
as
captain
auld
who
had
married
old
master
s
daughter
all
my
lessons
concerning
his
temper
and
disposition
and
the
best
methods
of
pleasing
him
were
yet
to
be
learnt
slaveholders
however
are
not
very
ceremonious
in
approaching
a
slave
and
my
ignorance
of
the
new
material
in
shape
of
a
master
was
but
transient
nor
was
my
mistress
long
in
making
known
her
animus
she
was
not
a
miss
lucretia
traces
of
whom
i
yet
remembered
and
the
more
especially
as
i
saw
them
shining
in
the
face
of
little
amanda
her
daughter
now
living
under
a
s
government
i
had
not
forgotten
the
soft
hand
guided
by
a
tender
heart
that
bound
up
with
healing
balsam
the
gash
made
in
my
head
by
ike
the
son
of
abel
thomas
and
rowena
i
found
to
be
a
pair
was
stingy
and
was
cruel
and
what
was
quite
natural
in
such
cases
she
possessed
the
ability
to
make
him
as
cruel
as
herself
while
she
could
easily
descend
to
the
level
of
his
meanness
in
the
house
of
master
thomas
i
was
made
for
the
first
time
in
seven
years
to
feel
the
pinchings
of
hunger
and
this
was
not
very
easy
to
bear
for
in
all
the
changes
of
master
hugh
s
family
there
was
no
change
in
the
bountifulness
with
which
they
supplied
me
with
food
not
to
give
a
slave
enough
to
eat
is
meanness
intensified
and
it
is
so
recognized
among
slaveholders
generally
in
maryland
the
rule
is
no
matter
how
coarse
the
food
only
let
there
be
enough
of
it
this
is
the
theory
and
in
the
part
of
maryland
i
came
from
the
general
practice
accords
with
this
theory
lloyd
s
plantation
was
an
exception
as
was
also
the
house
of
master
thomas
auld
all
know
the
lightness
of
indian
as
an
article
of
food
and
can
easily
judge
from
the
following
facts
whether
the
statements
i
have
made
of
the
stinginess
of
master
thomas
are
borne
out
there
were
four
slaves
of
us
in
the
kitchen
and
four
whites
in
the
great
house
thomas
auld
auld
hadaway
auld
brother
of
thomas
auld
and
little
amanda
the
names
of
the
slaves
in
the
kitchen
were
eliza
my
sister
priscilla
my
aunt
henny
my
cousin
and
myself
there
were
eight
persons
in
the
family
there
was
each
week
one
half
bushel
of
brought
from
the
mill
and
in
the
kitchen
was
almost
our
exclusive
food
for
very
little
else
was
allowed
us
out
of
this
bushel
of
the
family
in
the
great
house
had
a
small
loaf
every
morning
thus
leaving
us
in
the
kitchen
with
not
quite
a
half
a
peck
per
week
apiece
this
allowance
was
less
than
half
the
allowance
of
food
on
lloyd
s
plantation
it
was
not
enough
to
subsist
upon
and
we
were
therefore
reduced
to
the
wretched
necessity
of
living
at
the
expense
of
our
neighbors
we
were
compelled
either
to
beg
or
to
steal
and
we
did
both
i
frankly
confess
that
while
i
hated
everything
like
stealing
i
nevertheless
did
not
hesitate
to
take
food
when
i
was
hungry
wherever
i
could
find
it
nor
was
this
practice
the
mere
result
of
an
unreasoning
instinct
it
was
in
my
case
the
result
of
a
clear
apprehension
of
the
claims
of
morality
i
weighed
and
considered
the
matter
closely
before
i
ventured
to
satisfy
my
hunger
by
such
means
considering
that
my
labor
and
person
were
the
property
of
master
thomas
and
that
i
was
by
him
deprived
of
the
necessaries
of
life
necessaries
obtained
by
my
own
labor
it
was
easy
to
deduce
the
right
to
supply
myself
with
what
was
my
own
it
was
simply
appropriating
what
was
my
own
to
the
use
of
my
master
since
the
health
and
strength
derived
from
such
food
were
exerted
in
service
to
be
sure
this
was
stealing
according
to
the
law
and
gospel
i
heard
from
michael
s
pulpit
but
i
had
already
begun
to
attach
less
importance
to
what
dropped
from
that
quarter
on
that
point
while
as
yet
i
retained
my
reverence
for
religion
it
was
not
always
convenient
to
steal
from
master
and
the
same
reason
why
i
might
innocently
steal
from
him
did
not
seem
to
justify
me
in
stealing
from
others
in
the
case
of
my
master
it
was
only
a
question
of
the
taking
his
meat
out
of
one
tub
and
putting
it
into
another
the
ownership
of
the
meat
was
not
affected
by
the
transaction
at
first
he
owned
it
in
the
and
last
he
owned
it
in
his
meat
house
was
not
always
open
there
was
a
strict
watch
kept
on
that
point
and
the
key
was
on
a
large
bunch
in
rowena
s
pocket
a
great
many
times
have
we
poor
creatures
been
severely
pinched
with
hunger
when
meat
and
bread
have
been
moulding
under
the
lock
while
the
key
was
in
the
pocket
of
our
mistress
this
had
been
so
when
she
we
were
nearly
half
starved
and
yet
that
mistress
with
saintly
air
would
kneel
with
her
husband
and
pray
each
morning
that
a
merciful
god
would
bless
them
in
basket
and
in
store
and
save
them
at
last
in
his
kingdom
but
i
proceed
with
the
argument
it
was
necessary
that
right
to
steal
from
should
be
established
and
this
could
only
rest
upon
a
wider
range
of
generalization
than
that
which
supposed
the
right
to
steal
from
my
master
it
was
sometime
before
i
arrived
at
this
clear
right
the
reader
will
get
some
idea
of
my
train
of
reasoning
by
a
brief
statement
of
the
case
i
am
thought
i
not
only
the
slave
of
thomas
but
i
am
the
slave
of
society
at
large
society
at
large
has
bound
itself
in
form
and
in
fact
to
assist
master
thomas
in
robbing
me
of
my
rightful
liberty
and
of
the
just
reward
of
my
labor
therefore
whatever
rights
i
have
against
master
thomas
i
have
equally
against
those
confederated
with
him
in
robbing
me
of
liberty
as
society
has
marked
me
out
as
privileged
plunder
on
the
principle
of
i
am
justified
in
plundering
in
turn
since
each
slave
belongs
to
all
all
must
therefore
belong
to
i
shall
here
make
a
profession
of
faith
which
may
shock
some
offend
others
and
be
dissented
from
by
all
it
is
this
within
the
bounds
of
his
just
earnings
i
hold
that
the
slave
is
fully
justified
in
helping
himself
to
the
and
silver
and
the
best
apparel
of
his
master
or
that
of
any
other
slaveholder
and
that
such
taking
is
not
stealing
in
any
just
sense
of
that
the
morality
of
society
can
have
no
application
to
society
slaveholders
have
made
it
almost
impossible
for
the
slave
to
commit
any
crime
known
either
to
the
laws
of
god
or
to
the
laws
of
man
if
he
steals
he
takes
his
own
if
he
kills
his
master
he
imitates
only
the
heroes
of
the
revolution
slaveholders
i
hold
to
be
individually
and
collectively
responsible
for
all
the
evils
which
grow
out
of
the
horrid
relation
and
i
believe
they
will
be
so
held
at
the
judgment
in
the
sight
of
a
just
god
make
a
man
a
slave
and
you
rob
him
of
moral
responsibility
freedom
of
choice
is
the
essence
of
all
accountability
but
my
kind
readers
are
probably
less
concerned
about
my
opinions
than
about
that
which
more
nearly
touches
my
personal
experience
albeit
my
opinions
have
in
some
sort
been
formed
by
that
experience
bad
as
slaveholders
are
i
have
seldom
met
with
one
so
entirely
destitute
of
every
element
of
character
capable
of
inspiring
respect
as
was
my
present
master
capt
thomas
auld
when
i
lived
with
him
i
thought
him
incapable
of
a
noble
action
the
leading
trait
in
his
character
was
intense
selfishness
i
think
he
was
fully
aware
of
this
fact
himself
and
often
tried
to
conceal
it
capt
auld
was
not
a
slaveholder
not
a
birthright
member
of
the
slaveholding
oligarchy
he
was
only
a
slaveholder
by
and
of
all
slaveholders
these
latter
are
the
most
exacting
there
was
in
him
all
the
love
of
domination
the
pride
of
mastery
and
the
swagger
of
authority
but
his
rule
lacked
the
vital
element
of
consistency
he
could
be
cruel
but
his
methods
of
showing
it
were
cowardly
and
evinced
his
meanness
rather
than
his
spirit
his
commands
were
strong
his
enforcement
weak
slaves
are
not
insensible
to
the
characteristics
of
a
generous
dashing
slaveholder
who
is
fearless
of
consequences
and
they
prefer
a
master
of
this
bold
and
daring
kind
even
with
the
risk
of
being
shot
down
for
impudence
to
the
fretful
little
soul
who
never
uses
the
lash
but
at
the
suggestion
of
a
love
of
gain
slaves
too
readily
distinguish
between
the
birthright
bearing
of
the
original
slaveholder
and
the
assumed
attitudes
of
the
accidental
slaveholder
and
while
they
can
not
respect
either
they
certainly
despise
the
latter
more
than
the
former
the
luxury
of
having
slaves
wait
upon
him
was
something
new
to
master
thomas
and
for
it
he
was
wholly
unprepared
he
was
a
slaveholder
without
the
ability
to
hold
or
manage
his
slaves
we
seldom
called
him
master
but
generally
addressed
him
by
his
bay
craft
title
it
is
easy
to
see
that
such
conduct
might
do
much
to
make
him
appear
awkward
and
consequently
fretful
his
wife
was
especially
solicitous
to
have
us
call
her
husband
is
your
at
the
store
where
is
your
go
and
tell
your
i
will
make
your
acquainted
with
your
conduct
she
would
say
but
we
were
inapt
scholars
especially
were
i
and
my
sister
eliza
inapt
in
this
particular
aunt
priscilla
was
less
stubborn
and
defiant
in
her
spirit
than
eliza
and
myself
and
i
think
her
road
was
less
rough
than
ours
in
the
month
of
august
when
i
had
almost
become
desperate
under
the
treatment
of
master
thomas
and
when
i
entertained
more
strongly
than
ever
the
determination
to
run
away
a
circumstance
occurred
which
seemed
to
promise
brighter
and
better
days
for
us
all
at
a
methodist
held
in
the
bay
side
a
famous
place
for
campmeetings
about
eight
miles
from
michael
s
master
thomas
came
out
with
a
profession
of
religion
he
had
long
been
an
object
of
interest
to
the
church
and
to
the
ministers
as
i
had
seen
by
the
repeated
visits
and
lengthy
exhortations
of
the
latter
he
was
a
fish
quite
worth
catching
for
he
had
money
and
standing
in
the
community
of
michael
s
he
was
equal
to
the
best
citizen
he
was
strictly
temperate
from
principle
but
most
likely
from
interest
there
was
very
little
to
do
for
him
to
give
him
the
appearance
of
piety
and
to
make
him
a
pillar
in
the
church
well
the
continued
a
week
people
gathered
from
all
parts
of
the
county
and
two
steamboat
loads
came
from
baltimore
the
ground
was
happily
chosen
seats
were
arranged
a
stand
erected
a
rude
altar
fenced
in
fronting
the
preachers
stand
with
straw
in
it
for
the
accommodation
of
mourners
this
latter
would
hold
at
least
one
hundred
persons
in
front
and
on
the
sides
of
the
preachers
stand
and
outside
the
long
rows
of
seats
rose
the
first
class
of
stately
tents
each
vieing
with
the
other
in
strength
neatness
and
capacity
for
accommodating
its
inmates
behind
this
first
circle
of
tents
was
another
less
imposing
which
reached
round
the
to
the
speakers
stand
outside
this
second
class
of
tents
were
covered
wagons
ox
carts
and
vehicles
of
every
shape
and
size
these
served
as
tents
to
their
owners
outside
of
these
huge
fires
were
burning
in
all
directions
where
roasting
and
boiling
and
frying
were
going
on
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
were
attending
to
their
own
spiritual
welfare
within
the
circle
the
preachers
stand
a
narrow
space
was
marked
out
for
the
use
of
the
colored
people
there
were
no
seats
provided
for
this
class
of
persons
the
preachers
addressed
them
over
the
left
if
they
addressed
them
at
all
after
the
preaching
was
over
at
every
service
an
invitation
was
given
to
mourners
to
come
into
the
pen
and
in
some
cases
ministers
went
out
to
persuade
men
and
women
to
come
in
by
one
of
these
ministers
master
thomas
auld
was
persuaded
to
go
inside
the
pen
i
was
deeply
interested
in
that
matter
and
followed
and
though
colored
people
were
not
allowed
either
in
the
pen
or
in
front
of
the
preachers
stand
i
ventured
to
take
my
stand
at
a
sort
of
place
between
the
blacks
and
whites
where
i
could
distinctly
see
the
movements
of
mourners
and
especially
the
progress
of
master
thomas
if
he
has
got
religion
thought
i
he
will
emancipate
his
slaves
and
if
he
should
not
do
so
much
as
this
he
will
at
any
rate
behave
toward
us
more
kindly
and
feed
us
more
generously
than
he
has
heretofore
appealing
to
my
own
religious
experience
and
judging
my
master
by
what
was
true
in
my
own
case
i
could
not
regard
him
as
soundly
converted
unless
some
such
good
results
followed
his
profession
of
religion
but
in
my
expectations
i
was
doubly
disappointed
master
thomas
was
still
the
fruits
of
his
righteousness
were
to
show
themselves
in
no
such
way
as
i
had
anticipated
his
conversion
was
not
to
change
his
relation
toward
men
at
any
rate
not
toward
black
men
but
toward
god
my
faith
i
confess
was
not
great
there
was
something
in
his
appearance
that
in
my
mind
cast
a
doubt
over
his
conversion
standing
where
i
did
i
could
see
his
every
movement
i
watched
narrowly
while
he
remained
in
the
little
pen
and
although
i
saw
that
his
face
was
extremely
red
and
his
hair
disheveled
and
though
i
heard
him
groan
and
saw
a
stray
tear
halting
on
his
cheek
as
if
inquiring
which
way
shall
i
go
i
could
not
wholly
confide
in
the
genuineness
of
his
conversion
the
hesitating
behavior
of
that
and
its
loneliness
distressed
me
and
cast
a
doubt
upon
the
whole
transaction
of
which
it
was
a
part
but
people
said
capt
auld
had
come
through
and
it
was
for
me
to
hope
for
the
best
i
was
bound
to
do
this
in
charity
for
i
too
was
religious
and
had
been
in
the
church
full
three
years
although
now
i
was
not
more
than
sixteen
years
old
slaveholders
may
sometimes
have
confidence
in
the
piety
of
some
of
their
slaves
but
the
slaves
seldom
have
confidence
in
the
piety
of
their
masters
he
cant
go
to
heaven
with
our
blood
in
his
is
a
settled
point
in
the
creed
of
every
slave
rising
superior
to
all
teaching
to
the
contrary
and
standing
forever
as
a
fixed
fact
the
highest
evidence
the
slaveholder
can
give
the
slave
of
his
acceptance
with
god
is
the
emancipation
of
his
slaves
this
is
proof
that
he
is
willing
to
give
up
all
to
god
and
for
the
sake
of
god
not
to
do
this
was
in
my
estimation
and
in
the
opinion
of
all
the
slaves
an
evidence
of
and
wholly
inconsistent
with
the
idea
of
genuine
conversion
i
had
read
also
somewhere
in
the
methodist
discipline
the
following
question
and
answer
what
shall
be
done
for
the
extirpation
of
slavery
we
declare
that
we
are
much
as
ever
convinced
of
the
great
evil
of
slavery
therefore
no
slaveholder
shall
be
eligible
to
any
official
station
in
our
these
words
sounded
in
my
ears
for
a
long
time
and
encouraged
me
to
hope
but
as
i
have
before
said
i
was
doomed
to
disappointment
master
thomas
seemed
to
be
aware
of
my
hopes
and
expectations
concerning
him
i
have
thought
before
now
that
he
looked
at
me
in
answer
to
my
glances
as
much
as
to
say
i
will
teach
you
young
man
that
though
i
have
parted
with
my
sins
i
have
not
parted
with
my
sense
i
shall
hold
my
slaves
and
go
to
heaven
possibly
to
convince
us
that
we
must
not
presume
upon
his
recent
conversion
he
became
rather
more
rigid
and
stringent
in
his
exactions
there
always
was
a
scarcity
of
good
nature
about
the
man
but
now
his
whole
countenance
was
over
with
the
seemings
of
piety
his
religion
therefore
neither
made
him
emancipate
his
slaves
nor
caused
him
to
treat
them
with
greater
humanity
if
religion
had
any
effect
on
his
character
at
all
it
made
him
more
cruel
and
hateful
in
all
his
ways
the
natural
wickedness
of
his
heart
had
not
been
removed
but
only
reinforced
by
the
profession
of
religion
do
i
judge
him
harshly
god
forbid
facts
facts
capt
auld
made
the
greatest
profession
of
piety
his
house
was
literally
a
house
of
prayer
in
the
morning
and
in
the
evening
loud
prayers
and
hymns
were
heard
there
in
which
both
himself
and
his
wife
joined
yet
more
was
brought
from
the
mill
more
was
paid
to
the
moral
welfare
of
the
kitchen
and
nothing
was
done
to
make
us
feel
that
the
heart
of
master
thomas
was
one
whit
better
than
it
was
before
he
went
into
the
little
pen
opposite
to
the
preachers
stand
on
the
camp
ground
our
hopes
founded
on
the
discipline
soon
vanished
for
the
authorities
let
him
into
the
church
and
before
he
was
out
of
his
term
of
i
heard
of
his
leading
class
he
distinguished
himself
greatly
among
the
brethren
and
was
soon
an
exhorter
his
progress
was
almost
as
rapid
as
the
growth
of
the
fabled
vine
of
jack
s
bean
no
man
was
more
active
than
he
in
revivals
he
would
go
many
miles
to
assist
in
carrying
them
on
and
in
getting
outsiders
interested
in
religion
his
house
being
one
of
the
holiest
if
not
the
happiest
in
michael
s
became
the
preachers
these
preachers
evidently
liked
to
share
master
thomas
s
hospitality
for
while
he
he
them
three
or
four
of
these
ambassadors
of
the
gospel
according
to
slavery
have
been
there
at
a
time
all
living
on
the
fat
of
the
land
while
we
in
the
kitchen
were
nearly
starving
not
often
did
we
get
a
smile
of
recognition
from
these
holy
men
they
seemed
almost
as
unconcerned
about
our
getting
to
heaven
as
they
were
about
our
getting
out
of
slavery
to
this
general
charge
there
was
one
exception
the
rev
george
cookman
unlike
rev
storks
ewry
hickey
humphrey
and
cooper
all
whom
were
on
the
michael
s
circuit
he
kindly
took
an
interest
in
our
temporal
and
spiritual
welfare
our
souls
and
our
bodies
were
all
alike
sacred
in
his
sight
and
he
really
had
a
good
deal
of
genuine
feeling
mingled
with
his
colonization
ideas
there
was
not
a
slave
in
our
neighborhood
that
did
not
love
and
almost
venerate
cookman
it
was
pretty
generally
believed
that
he
had
been
chiefly
instrumental
in
bringing
one
of
the
largest
slaveholders
samuel
harrison
in
that
neighborhood
to
emancipate
all
his
slaves
and
indeed
the
general
impression
was
that
cookman
had
labored
faithfully
with
slaveholders
whenever
he
met
them
to
induce
them
to
emancipate
their
bondmen
and
that
he
did
this
as
a
religious
duty
when
this
good
man
was
at
our
house
we
were
all
sure
to
be
called
in
to
prayers
in
the
morning
and
he
was
not
slow
in
making
inquiries
as
to
the
state
of
our
minds
nor
in
giving
us
a
word
of
exhortation
and
of
encouragement
great
was
the
sorrow
of
all
the
slaves
when
this
faithful
preacher
of
the
gospel
was
removed
from
the
talbot
county
circuit
he
was
an
eloquent
preacher
and
possessed
what
few
ministers
south
of
mason
dixon
s
line
possess
or
to
show
viz
a
warm
and
philanthropic
heart
the
cookman
of
whom
i
speak
was
an
englishman
by
birth
and
perished
while
on
his
way
to
england
on
board
the
president
could
the
thousands
of
slaves
in
maryland
know
the
fate
of
the
good
man
to
whose
words
of
comfort
they
were
so
largely
indebted
they
would
thank
me
for
dropping
a
tear
on
this
page
in
memory
of
their
favorite
preacher
friend
and
benefactor
but
let
me
return
to
master
thomas
and
to
my
experience
after
his
conversion
in
baltimore
i
could
occasionally
get
into
a
sabbath
school
among
the
free
children
and
receive
lessons
with
the
rest
but
having
already
learned
both
to
read
and
to
write
i
was
more
of
a
teacher
than
a
pupil
even
there
when
however
i
went
back
to
the
eastern
shore
and
was
at
the
house
of
master
thomas
i
was
neither
allowed
to
teach
nor
to
be
taught
the
whole
community
with
but
a
single
exception
among
the
whites
frowned
upon
everything
like
imparting
instruction
either
to
slaves
or
to
free
colored
persons
that
single
exception
a
pious
young
man
named
wilson
asked
me
one
day
if
i
would
like
to
assist
him
in
teaching
a
little
sabbath
school
at
the
house
of
a
free
colored
man
in
michael
s
named
james
mitchell
the
idea
was
to
me
a
delightful
one
and
i
told
him
i
would
gladly
devote
as
much
of
my
sabbath
as
i
could
command
to
that
most
laudable
work
wilson
soon
mustered
up
a
dozen
old
spelling
books
and
a
few
testaments
and
we
commenced
operations
with
some
twenty
scholars
in
our
sunday
school
here
thought
i
is
something
worth
living
for
here
is
an
excellent
chance
for
usefulness
and
i
shall
soon
have
a
company
of
young
friends
lovers
of
knowledge
like
some
of
my
baltimore
friends
from
whom
i
now
felt
parted
forever
our
first
sabbath
passed
delightfully
and
i
spent
the
week
after
very
joyously
i
could
not
go
to
baltimore
but
i
could
make
a
little
baltimore
here
at
our
second
meeting
i
learned
that
there
was
some
objection
to
the
existence
of
the
sabbath
school
and
sure
enough
we
had
scarcely
got
at
work
simply
teaching
a
few
colored
children
how
to
read
the
gospel
of
the
son
of
god
when
in
rushed
a
mob
headed
by
wright
fairbanks
and
garrison
west
two
and
master
thomas
who
armed
with
sticks
and
other
missiles
drove
us
off
and
commanded
us
never
to
meet
for
such
a
purpose
again
one
of
this
pious
crew
told
me
that
as
for
my
part
i
wanted
to
be
another
nat
turner
and
if
i
did
not
look
out
i
should
get
as
many
balls
into
me
as
nat
did
into
him
thus
ended
the
infant
sabbath
school
in
the
town
of
michael
s
the
reader
will
not
be
surprised
when
i
say
that
the
breaking
up
of
my
sabbath
school
by
these
and
professedly
holy
men
did
not
serve
to
strengthen
my
religious
convictions
the
cloud
over
my
michael
s
home
grew
heavier
and
blacker
than
ever
it
was
not
merely
the
agency
of
master
thomas
in
breaking
up
and
destroying
my
sabbath
school
that
shook
my
confidence
in
the
power
of
southern
religion
to
make
men
wiser
or
better
but
i
saw
in
him
all
the
cruelty
and
meanness
his
conversion
which
he
had
exhibited
before
he
made
a
profession
of
religion
his
cruelty
and
meanness
were
especially
displayed
in
his
treatment
of
my
unfortunate
cousin
henny
whose
lameness
made
her
a
burden
to
him
i
have
no
extraordinary
personal
hard
usage
toward
myself
to
complain
of
against
him
but
i
have
seen
him
tie
up
the
lame
and
maimed
woman
and
whip
her
in
a
manner
most
brutal
and
shocking
and
then
with
blasphemy
he
would
quote
the
passage
of
scripture
that
servant
which
knew
his
lord
s
will
and
prepared
not
himself
neither
did
according
to
his
will
shall
be
beaten
with
many
master
would
keep
this
lacerated
woman
tied
up
by
her
wrists
to
a
bolt
in
the
joist
three
four
and
five
hours
at
a
time
he
would
tie
her
up
early
in
the
morning
whip
her
with
a
cowskin
before
breakfast
leave
her
tied
up
go
to
his
store
and
returning
to
his
dinner
repeat
the
castigation
laying
on
the
rugged
lash
on
flesh
already
made
raw
by
repeated
blows
he
seemed
desirous
to
get
the
poor
girl
out
of
existence
or
at
any
rate
off
his
hands
in
proof
of
this
he
afterwards
gave
her
away
to
his
sister
sarah
cline
but
as
in
the
case
of
master
hugh
henny
was
soon
returned
on
his
hands
finally
upon
a
pretense
that
he
could
do
nothing
with
her
i
use
his
own
words
he
set
her
adrift
to
take
care
of
here
was
a
recently
converted
man
holding
with
tight
grasp
the
and
able
bodied
slaves
left
him
by
old
master
the
persons
who
in
freedom
could
have
taken
care
of
themselves
yet
turning
loose
the
only
cripple
among
them
virtually
to
starve
and
die
no
doubt
had
master
thomas
been
asked
by
some
pious
northern
brother
he
continued
to
sustain
the
relation
of
a
slaveholder
to
those
whom
he
retained
his
answer
would
have
been
precisely
the
same
as
many
other
religious
slaveholders
have
returned
to
that
inquiry
viz
i
hold
my
slaves
for
their
own
bad
as
my
condition
was
when
i
lived
with
master
thomas
i
was
soon
to
experience
a
life
far
more
goading
and
bitter
the
many
differences
springing
up
between
myself
and
master
thomas
owing
to
the
clear
perception
i
had
of
his
character
and
the
boldness
with
which
i
defended
myself
against
his
capricious
complaints
led
him
to
declare
that
i
was
unsuited
to
his
wants
that
my
city
life
had
affected
me
perniciously
that
in
fact
it
had
almost
ruined
me
for
every
good
purpose
and
had
fitted
me
for
everything
that
was
bad
one
of
my
greatest
faults
or
offenses
was
that
of
letting
his
horse
get
away
and
go
down
to
the
farm
belonging
to
his
the
animal
had
a
liking
for
that
farm
with
which
i
fully
sympathized
whenever
i
let
it
out
it
would
go
dashing
down
the
road
to
hamilton
s
as
if
going
on
a
grand
frolic
my
horse
gone
of
course
i
must
go
after
it
the
explanation
of
our
mutual
attachment
to
the
place
is
the
same
the
horse
found
there
good
pasturage
and
i
found
there
plenty
of
bread
hamilton
had
his
faults
but
starving
his
slaves
was
not
among
them
he
gave
food
in
abundance
and
that
too
of
an
excellent
quality
in
hamilton
s
cook
aunt
mary
i
found
a
most
generous
and
considerate
friend
she
never
allowed
me
to
go
there
without
giving
me
bread
enough
to
make
good
the
deficiencies
of
a
day
or
two
master
thomas
at
last
resolved
to
endure
my
behavior
no
longer
he
could
neither
keep
me
nor
his
horse
we
liked
so
well
to
be
at
his
s
farm
i
had
now
lived
with
him
nearly
nine
months
and
he
had
given
me
a
number
of
severe
whippings
without
any
visible
improvement
in
my
character
or
my
conduct
and
now
he
was
resolved
to
put
me
out
as
he
said
be
there
was
in
the
bay
side
very
near
the
camp
ground
where
my
master
got
his
religious
impressions
a
man
named
edward
covey
who
enjoyed
the
execrated
reputation
of
being
a
first
rate
hand
at
breaking
young
negroes
this
covey
was
a
poor
man
a
farm
renter
and
this
reputation
hateful
as
it
was
to
the
slaves
and
to
all
good
men
was
at
the
same
time
of
immense
advantage
to
him
it
enabled
him
to
get
his
farm
tilled
with
very
little
expense
compared
with
what
it
would
have
cost
him
without
this
most
extraordinary
reputation
some
slaveholders
thought
it
an
advantage
to
let
mr
covey
have
the
government
of
their
slaves
a
year
or
two
almost
free
of
charge
for
the
sake
of
the
excellent
training
such
slaves
got
under
his
happy
management
like
some
horse
breakers
noted
for
their
skill
who
ride
the
best
horses
in
the
country
without
expense
mr
covey
could
have
under
him
the
most
fiery
bloods
of
the
neighborhood
for
the
simple
reward
of
returning
them
to
their
owners
added
to
the
natural
fitness
of
mr
covey
for
the
duties
of
his
profession
he
was
said
to
enjoy
religion
and
was
as
strict
in
the
cultivation
of
piety
as
he
was
in
the
cultivation
of
his
farm
i
was
made
aware
of
his
character
by
some
who
had
been
under
his
hand
and
while
i
could
not
look
forward
to
going
to
him
with
any
pleasure
i
was
glad
to
get
away
from
michael
s
i
was
sure
of
getting
enough
to
eat
at
covey
s
even
if
i
suffered
in
other
respects
to
a
hungry
man
is
not
a
prospect
to
be
regarded
with
indifference

had
committed
me
without
reserve
to
the
mastery
of
edward
covey
eight
or
ten
years
had
now
passed
since
i
had
been
taken
from
my
grandmother
s
cabin
in
tuckahoe
and
these
years
for
the
most
part
i
had
spent
in
baltimore
where
as
the
reader
has
already
seen
i
was
treated
with
comparative
tenderness
i
was
now
about
to
sound
profounder
depths
in
slave
life
the
rigors
of
a
field
less
tolerable
than
the
field
of
battle
awaited
me
my
new
master
was
notorious
for
his
fierce
and
savage
disposition
and
my
only
consolation
in
going
to
live
with
him
was
the
certainty
of
finding
him
precisely
as
represented
by
common
fame
there
was
neither
joy
in
my
heart
nor
elasticity
in
my
step
as
i
started
in
search
of
the
tyrant
s
home
starvation
made
me
glad
to
leave
thomas
auld
s
and
the
cruel
lash
made
me
dread
to
go
to
covey
s
escape
was
impossible
so
heavy
and
sad
i
paced
the
seven
miles
which
separated
covey
s
house
from
michael
s
thinking
much
by
the
solitary
way
averse
to
my
condition
but
was
all
i
could
do
like
a
fish
in
a
net
allowed
to
play
for
a
time
i
was
now
drawn
rapidly
to
the
shore
secured
at
all
points
i
am
thought
i
but
the
sport
of
a
power
which
makes
no
account
either
of
my
welfare
or
of
my
happiness
by
a
law
which
i
can
clearly
comprehend
but
can
not
evade
nor
resist
i
am
ruthlessly
snatched
from
the
hearth
of
a
fond
grandmother
and
hurried
away
to
the
home
of
a
mysterious
old
master
again
i
am
removed
from
there
to
a
master
in
baltimore
thence
am
i
snatched
away
to
the
eastern
shore
to
be
valued
with
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
with
them
divided
and
set
apart
for
a
possessor
then
i
am
sent
back
to
baltimore
and
by
the
time
i
have
formed
new
attachments
and
have
begun
to
hope
that
no
more
rude
shocks
shall
touch
me
a
difference
arises
between
brothers
and
i
am
again
broken
up
and
sent
to
michael
s
and
now
from
the
latter
place
i
am
footing
my
way
to
the
home
of
a
new
master
where
i
am
given
to
understand
that
like
a
wild
young
working
animal
i
am
to
be
broken
to
the
yoke
of
a
bitter
and
with
thoughts
and
reflections
like
these
i
came
in
sight
of
a
small
building
about
a
mile
from
the
main
road
which
from
the
description
i
had
received
at
starting
i
easily
recognized
as
my
new
home
the
chesapeake
bay
upon
the
jutting
banks
of
which
the
little
house
was
standing
white
with
foam
raised
by
the
heavy
wind
poplar
island
covered
with
a
thick
black
pine
forest
standing
out
amid
this
half
ocean
and
kent
point
stretching
its
sandy
shores
out
into
the
bay
were
all
in
sight
and
deepened
the
wild
and
desolate
aspect
of
my
new
home
the
good
clothes
i
had
brought
with
me
from
baltimore
were
now
worn
thin
and
had
not
been
replaced
for
master
thomas
was
as
little
careful
to
provide
us
against
cold
as
against
hunger
met
here
by
a
north
wind
sweeping
through
an
open
space
of
forty
miles
i
was
glad
to
make
any
port
and
therefore
i
speedily
pressed
on
to
the
little
house
the
family
consisted
of
and
mrs
covey
miss
kemp
a
woman
a
sister
of
mrs
covey
william
hughes
cousin
to
edward
covey
caroline
the
cook
bill
smith
a
hired
man
and
myself
bill
smith
bill
hughes
and
myself
were
the
working
force
of
the
farm
which
consisted
of
three
or
four
hundred
acres
i
was
now
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
to
be
a
field
hand
and
in
my
new
employment
i
found
myself
even
more
awkward
than
a
green
country
boy
may
be
supposed
to
be
upon
his
first
entrance
into
the
bewildering
scenes
of
city
life
and
my
awkwardness
gave
me
much
trouble
strange
and
unnatural
as
it
may
seem
i
had
been
at
my
new
home
but
three
days
before
mr
covey
my
brother
in
the
methodist
church
gave
me
a
bitter
foretaste
of
what
was
in
reserve
for
me
i
presume
he
thought
that
since
he
had
but
a
single
year
in
which
to
complete
his
work
the
sooner
he
began
the
better
perhaps
he
thought
that
by
coming
to
blows
at
once
we
should
mutually
better
understand
our
relations
but
to
whatever
motive
direct
or
indirect
the
cause
may
be
referred
i
had
not
been
in
his
possession
three
whole
days
before
he
subjected
me
to
a
most
brutal
chastisement
under
his
heavy
blows
blood
flowed
freely
and
wales
were
left
on
my
back
as
large
as
my
little
finger
the
sores
on
my
back
from
this
flogging
continued
for
weeks
for
they
were
kept
open
by
the
rough
and
coarse
cloth
which
i
wore
for
shirting
the
occasion
and
details
of
this
first
chapter
of
my
experience
as
a
field
hand
must
be
told
that
the
reader
may
see
how
unreasonable
as
well
as
how
cruel
my
new
master
covey
was
the
whole
thing
i
found
to
be
characteristic
of
the
man
and
i
was
probably
treated
no
worse
by
him
than
scores
of
lads
who
had
previously
been
committed
to
him
for
reasons
similar
to
those
which
induced
my
master
to
place
me
with
him
but
here
are
the
facts
connected
with
the
affair
precisely
as
they
occurred
on
one
of
the
coldest
days
of
the
whole
month
of
january
i
was
ordered
at
day
break
to
get
a
load
of
wood
from
a
forest
about
two
miles
from
the
house
in
order
to
perform
this
work
mr
covey
gave
me
a
pair
of
unbroken
oxen
for
it
seems
his
breaking
abilities
had
not
been
turned
in
this
direction
and
i
may
remark
in
passing
that
working
animals
in
the
south
are
seldom
so
well
trained
as
in
the
north
in
due
form
and
with
all
proper
ceremony
i
was
introduced
to
this
huge
yoke
of
unbroken
oxen
and
was
carefully
told
which
was
buck
and
which
was
darby
which
was
the
in
hand
and
which
was
the
off
hand
ox
the
master
of
this
important
ceremony
was
no
less
a
person
than
mr
covey
himself
and
the
introduction
was
the
first
of
the
kind
i
had
ever
had
my
life
hitherto
had
led
me
away
from
horned
cattle
and
i
had
no
knowledge
of
the
art
of
managing
them
what
was
meant
by
the
in
ox
as
against
the
off
ox
when
both
were
equally
fastened
to
one
cart
and
under
one
yoke
i
could
not
very
easily
divine
and
the
difference
implied
by
the
names
and
the
peculiar
duties
of
each
were
alike
to
me
why
was
not
the
off
ox
called
the
in
ox
where
and
what
is
the
reason
for
this
distinction
in
names
when
there
is
none
in
the
things
themselves
after
initiating
me
into
the
woa
back
gee
hither
the
entire
spoken
language
between
oxen
and
driver
mr
covey
took
a
rope
about
ten
feet
long
and
one
inch
thick
and
placed
one
end
of
it
around
the
horns
of
the
in
hand
ox
and
gave
the
other
end
to
me
telling
me
that
if
the
oxen
started
to
run
away
as
the
scamp
knew
they
would
i
must
hold
on
to
the
rope
and
stop
them
i
need
not
tell
any
one
who
is
acquainted
with
either
the
strength
of
the
disposition
of
an
untamed
ox
that
this
order
was
about
as
unreasonable
as
a
command
to
shoulder
a
mad
bull
i
had
never
driven
oxen
before
and
i
was
as
awkward
as
a
driver
as
it
is
possible
to
conceive
it
did
not
answer
for
me
to
plead
ignorance
to
mr
covey
there
was
something
in
his
manner
that
quite
forbade
that
he
was
a
man
to
whom
a
slave
seldom
felt
any
disposition
to
speak
cold
distant
morose
with
a
face
wearing
all
the
marks
of
captious
pride
and
malicious
sternness
he
repelled
all
advances
covey
was
not
a
large
man
he
was
only
about
five
feet
ten
inches
in
height
i
should
think
short
necked
round
shoulders
of
quick
and
wiry
motion
of
thin
and
wolfish
visage
with
a
pair
of
small
eyes
set
well
back
under
a
forehead
without
dignity
and
constantly
in
motion
and
floating
his
passions
rather
than
his
thoughts
in
sight
but
denying
them
utterance
in
words
the
creature
presented
an
appearance
altogether
ferocious
and
sinister
disagreeable
and
forbidding
in
the
extreme
when
he
spoke
it
was
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth
and
in
a
sort
of
light
growl
like
a
dog
when
an
attempt
is
made
to
take
a
bone
from
him
the
fellow
had
already
made
me
believe
him
even
than
he
had
been
presented
with
his
directions
and
without
stopping
to
question
i
started
for
the
woods
quite
anxious
to
perform
my
first
exploit
in
driving
in
a
creditable
manner
the
distance
from
the
house
to
the
woods
gate
a
full
mile
i
should
think
was
passed
over
with
very
little
difficulty
for
although
the
animals
ran
i
was
fleet
enough
in
the
open
field
to
keep
pace
with
them
especially
as
they
pulled
me
along
at
the
end
of
the
rope
but
on
reaching
the
woods
i
was
speedily
thrown
into
a
distressing
plight
the
animals
took
fright
and
started
off
ferociously
into
the
woods
carrying
the
cart
full
tilt
against
trees
over
stumps
and
dashing
from
side
to
side
in
a
manner
altogether
frightful
as
i
held
the
rope
i
expected
every
moment
to
be
crushed
between
the
cart
and
the
huge
trees
among
which
they
were
so
furiously
dashing
after
running
thus
for
several
minutes
my
oxen
were
finally
brought
to
a
stand
by
a
tree
against
which
they
dashed
themselves
with
great
violence
upsetting
the
cart
and
entangling
themselves
among
sundry
young
saplings
by
the
shock
the
body
of
the
cart
was
flung
in
one
direction
and
the
wheels
and
tongue
in
another
and
all
in
the
greatest
confusion
there
i
was
all
alone
in
a
thick
wood
to
which
i
was
a
stranger
my
cart
upset
and
shattered
my
oxen
entangled
wild
and
enraged
and
i
poor
soul
but
a
green
hand
to
set
all
this
disorder
right
i
knew
no
more
of
oxen
than
the
ox
driver
is
supposed
to
know
of
wisdom
after
standing
a
few
moments
surveying
the
damage
and
disorder
and
not
without
a
presentiment
that
this
trouble
would
draw
after
it
others
even
more
distressing
i
took
one
end
of
the
cart
body
and
by
an
extra
outlay
of
strength
i
lifted
it
toward
the
from
which
it
had
been
violently
flung
and
after
much
pulling
and
straining
i
succeeded
in
getting
the
body
of
the
cart
in
its
place
this
was
an
important
step
out
of
the
difficulty
and
its
performance
increased
my
courage
for
the
work
which
remained
to
be
done
the
cart
was
provided
with
an
ax
a
tool
with
which
i
had
become
pretty
well
acquainted
in
the
ship
yard
at
baltimore
with
this
i
cut
down
the
saplings
by
which
my
oxen
were
entangled
and
again
pursued
my
journey
with
my
heart
in
my
mouth
lest
the
oxen
should
again
take
it
into
their
senseless
heads
to
cut
up
a
caper
my
fears
were
groundless
their
spree
was
over
for
the
present
and
the
rascals
now
moved
off
as
soberly
as
though
their
behavior
had
been
natural
and
exemplary
on
reaching
the
part
of
the
forest
where
i
had
been
the
day
before
chopping
wood
i
filled
the
cart
with
a
heavy
load
as
a
security
against
another
running
away
but
the
neck
of
an
ox
is
equal
in
strength
to
iron
it
defies
all
ordinary
burdens
when
excited
tame
and
docile
to
a
proverb
when
trained
the
ox
is
the
most
sullen
and
intractable
of
animals
when
but
half
broken
to
the
yoke
i
now
saw
in
my
situation
several
points
of
similarity
with
that
of
the
oxen
they
were
property
so
was
i
they
were
to
be
broken
so
was
i
covey
was
to
break
me
i
was
to
break
them
break
and
be
broken
such
is
life
half
the
day
already
gone
and
my
face
not
yet
homeward
it
required
only
two
day
s
experience
and
observation
to
teach
me
that
such
apparent
waste
of
time
would
not
be
lightly
overlooked
by
covey
i
therefore
hurried
toward
home
but
on
reaching
the
lane
gate
i
met
with
the
crowning
disaster
for
the
day
this
gate
was
a
fair
specimen
of
southern
handicraft
there
were
two
huge
posts
eighteen
inches
in
diameter
rough
hewed
and
square
and
the
heavy
gate
was
so
hung
on
one
of
these
that
it
opened
only
about
half
the
proper
distance
on
arriving
here
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
let
go
the
end
of
the
rope
on
the
horns
of
the
in
hand
ox
and
now
as
soon
as
the
gate
was
open
and
i
let
go
of
it
to
get
the
rope
again
off
went
my
oxen
making
nothing
of
their
load
full
tilt
and
in
doing
so
they
caught
the
huge
gate
between
the
wheel
and
the
cart
body
literally
crushing
it
to
splinters
and
coming
only
within
a
few
inches
of
subjecting
me
to
a
similar
crushing
for
i
was
just
in
advance
of
the
wheel
when
it
struck
the
left
gate
post
with
these
two
escape
i
thought
i
could
sucessfully
sic
explain
to
mr
covey
the
delay
and
avert
apprehended
punishment
i
was
not
without
a
faint
hope
of
being
commended
for
the
stern
resolution
which
i
had
displayed
in
accomplishing
the
difficult
task
a
task
which
i
afterwards
learned
even
covey
himself
would
not
have
undertaken
without
first
driving
the
oxen
for
some
time
in
the
open
field
preparatory
to
their
going
into
the
woods
but
in
this
i
was
disappointed
on
coming
to
him
his
countenance
assumed
an
aspect
of
rigid
displeasure
and
as
i
gave
him
a
history
of
the
casualties
of
my
trip
his
wolfish
face
with
his
greenish
eyes
became
intensely
ferocious
go
back
to
the
woods
again
he
said
muttering
something
else
about
wasting
time
i
hastily
obeyed
but
i
had
not
gone
far
on
my
way
when
i
saw
him
coming
after
me
my
oxen
now
behaved
themselves
with
singular
propriety
opposing
their
present
conduct
to
my
representation
of
their
former
antics
i
almost
wished
now
that
covey
was
coming
they
would
do
something
in
keeping
with
the
character
i
had
given
them
but
no
they
had
already
had
their
spree
and
they
could
afford
now
to
be
extra
good
readily
obeying
my
orders
and
seeming
to
understand
them
quite
as
well
as
i
did
myself
on
reaching
the
woods
my
tormentor
who
seemed
all
the
way
to
be
remarking
upon
the
good
behavior
of
his
oxen
came
up
to
me
and
ordered
me
to
stop
the
cart
accompanying
the
same
with
the
threat
that
he
would
now
teach
me
how
to
break
gates
and
idle
away
my
time
when
he
sent
me
to
the
woods
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
covey
paced
off
in
his
own
wiry
fashion
to
a
large
black
gum
tree
the
young
shoots
of
which
are
generally
used
for
ox
they
being
exceedingly
tough
three
of
these
from
four
to
six
feet
long
he
cut
off
and
trimmed
up
with
his
large
this
done
he
ordered
me
to
take
off
my
clothes
to
this
unreasonable
order
i
made
no
reply
but
sternly
refused
to
take
off
my
clothing
if
you
will
beat
me
thought
i
you
shall
do
so
over
my
after
many
threats
which
made
no
impression
on
me
he
rushed
at
me
with
something
of
the
savage
fierceness
of
a
wolf
tore
off
the
few
and
thinly
worn
clothes
i
had
on
and
proceeded
to
wear
out
on
my
back
the
heavy
goads
which
he
had
cut
from
the
gum
tree
this
flogging
was
the
first
of
a
series
of
floggings
and
though
very
severe
it
was
less
so
than
many
which
came
after
it
and
these
for
offenses
far
lighter
than
the
gate
breaking
i
remained
with
mr
covey
one
year
i
can
not
say
i
with
him
and
during
the
first
six
months
that
i
was
there
i
was
whipped
either
with
sticks
or
cowskins
every
week
aching
bones
and
a
sore
back
were
my
constant
companions
frequent
as
the
lash
was
used
mr
covey
thought
less
of
it
as
a
means
of
breaking
down
my
spirit
than
that
of
hard
and
long
continued
labor
he
worked
me
steadily
up
to
the
point
of
my
powers
of
endurance
from
the
dawn
of
day
in
the
morning
till
the
darkness
was
complete
in
the
evening
i
was
kept
at
hard
work
in
the
field
or
the
woods
at
certain
seasons
of
the
year
we
were
all
kept
in
the
field
till
eleven
and
twelve
o
clock
at
night
at
these
times
covey
would
attend
us
in
the
field
and
urge
us
on
with
words
or
blows
as
it
seemed
best
to
him
he
had
in
his
life
been
an
overseer
and
he
well
understood
the
business
of
slave
driving
there
was
no
deceiving
him
he
knew
just
what
a
man
or
boy
could
do
and
he
held
both
to
strict
account
when
he
pleased
he
would
work
himself
like
a
very
turk
making
everything
fly
before
him
it
was
however
scarcely
necessary
for
mr
covey
to
be
really
present
in
the
field
to
have
his
work
go
on
industriously
he
had
the
faculty
of
making
us
feel
that
he
was
always
present
by
a
series
of
adroitly
managed
surprises
which
he
practiced
i
was
prepared
to
expect
him
at
any
moment
his
plan
was
never
to
approach
the
spot
where
his
hands
were
at
work
in
an
open
manly
and
direct
manner
no
thief
was
ever
more
artful
in
his
devices
than
this
man
covey
he
would
creep
and
crawl
in
ditches
and
gullies
hide
behind
stumps
and
bushes
and
practice
so
much
of
the
cunning
of
the
serpent
that
bill
smith
and
i
between
ourselves
never
called
him
by
any
other
name
than
the
we
fancied
that
in
his
eyes
and
his
gait
we
could
see
a
snakish
resemblance
one
half
of
his
proficiency
in
the
art
of
negro
breaking
consisted
i
should
think
in
this
species
of
cunning
we
were
never
secure
he
could
see
or
hear
us
nearly
all
the
time
he
was
to
us
behind
every
stump
tree
bush
and
fence
on
the
plantation
he
carried
this
kind
of
trickery
so
far
that
he
would
sometimes
mount
his
horse
and
make
believe
he
was
going
to
michael
s
and
in
thirty
minutes
afterward
you
might
find
his
horse
tied
in
the
woods
and
the
covey
lying
flat
in
the
ditch
with
his
head
lifted
above
its
edge
or
in
a
fence
corner
watching
every
movement
of
the
slaves
i
have
known
him
walk
up
to
us
and
give
us
special
orders
as
to
our
work
in
advance
as
if
he
were
leaving
home
with
a
view
to
being
absent
several
days
and
before
he
got
half
way
to
the
house
he
would
avail
himself
of
our
inattention
to
his
movements
to
turn
short
on
his
heels
conceal
himself
behind
a
fence
corner
or
a
tree
and
watch
us
until
the
going
down
of
the
sun
mean
and
contemptible
as
is
all
this
it
is
in
keeping
with
the
character
which
the
life
of
a
slaveholder
is
calculated
to
produce
there
is
no
earthly
inducement
in
the
slave
s
condition
to
incite
him
to
labor
faithfully
the
fear
of
punishment
is
the
sole
motive
for
any
sort
of
industry
with
him
knowing
this
fact
as
the
slaveholder
does
and
judging
the
slave
by
himself
he
naturally
concludes
the
slave
will
be
idle
whenever
the
cause
for
this
fear
is
absent
hence
all
sorts
of
petty
deceptions
are
practiced
to
inspire
this
fear
but
with
mr
covey
trickery
was
natural
everything
in
the
shape
of
learning
or
religion
which
he
possessed
was
made
to
conform
to
this
propensity
he
did
not
seem
conscious
that
the
practice
had
anything
unmanly
base
or
contemptible
about
it
it
was
a
part
of
an
important
system
with
him
essential
to
the
relation
of
master
and
slave
i
thought
i
saw
in
his
very
religious
devotions
this
controlling
element
of
his
character
a
long
prayer
at
night
made
up
for
the
short
prayer
in
the
morning
and
few
men
could
seem
more
devotional
than
he
when
he
had
nothing
else
to
do
mr
covey
was
not
content
with
the
cold
style
of
family
worship
adopted
in
these
cold
latitudes
which
begin
and
end
with
a
simple
prayer
no
the
voice
of
praise
as
well
as
of
prayer
must
be
heard
in
his
house
night
and
morning
at
first
i
was
called
upon
to
bear
some
part
in
these
exercises
but
the
repeated
flogging
given
me
by
covey
turned
the
whole
thing
into
mockery
he
was
a
poor
singer
and
mainly
relied
on
me
for
raising
the
hymn
for
the
family
and
when
i
failed
to
do
so
he
was
thrown
into
much
confusion
i
do
not
think
that
he
ever
abused
me
on
account
of
these
vexations
his
religion
was
a
thing
altogether
apart
from
his
worldly
concerns
he
knew
nothing
of
it
as
a
holy
principle
directing
and
controlling
his
daily
life
making
the
latter
conform
to
the
requirements
of
the
gospel
one
or
two
facts
will
illustrate
his
character
better
than
a
volume
of
generalties
sic
i
have
already
said
or
implied
that
edward
covey
was
a
poor
man
he
was
in
fact
just
commencing
to
lay
the
foundation
of
his
fortune
as
fortune
is
regarded
in
a
slave
state
the
first
condition
of
wealth
and
respectability
there
being
the
ownership
of
human
property
every
nerve
is
strained
by
the
poor
man
to
obtain
it
and
very
little
regard
is
had
to
the
manner
of
obtaining
it
in
pursuit
of
this
object
pious
as
mr
covey
was
he
proved
himself
to
be
as
unscrupulous
and
base
as
the
worst
of
his
neighbors
in
the
beginning
he
was
only
able
as
he
said
to
buy
one
slave
and
scandalous
and
shocking
as
is
the
fact
he
boasted
that
he
bought
her
simply
a
but
the
worst
is
not
told
in
this
naked
statement
this
young
woman
caroline
was
her
name
was
virtually
compelled
by
mr
covey
to
abandon
herself
to
the
object
for
which
he
had
purchased
her
and
the
result
was
the
birth
of
twins
at
the
end
of
the
year
at
this
addition
to
his
human
stock
both
edward
covey
and
his
wife
susan
were
ecstatic
with
joy
no
one
dreamed
of
reproaching
the
woman
or
of
finding
fault
with
the
hired
man
bill
smith
the
father
of
the
children
for
mr
covey
himself
had
locked
the
two
up
together
every
night
thus
inviting
the
result
but
i
will
pursue
this
revolting
subject
no
further
no
better
illustration
of
the
unchaste
and
demoralizing
character
of
slavery
can
be
found
than
is
furnished
in
the
fact
that
this
professedly
christian
slaveholder
amidst
all
his
prayers
and
hymns
was
shamelessly
and
boastfully
encouraging
and
actually
compelling
in
his
own
house
undisguised
and
unmitigated
fornication
as
a
means
of
increasing
his
human
stock
i
may
remark
here
that
while
this
fact
will
be
read
with
disgust
and
shame
at
the
north
it
will
be
as
smart
and
praiseworthy
in
mr
covey
at
the
south
for
a
man
is
no
more
condemned
there
for
buying
a
woman
and
devoting
her
to
this
life
of
dishonor
than
for
buying
a
cow
and
raising
stock
from
her
the
same
rules
are
observed
with
a
view
to
increasing
the
number
and
quality
of
the
former
as
of
the
latter
i
will
here
reproduce
what
i
said
of
my
own
experience
in
this
wretched
place
more
than
ten
years
ago
if
at
any
one
time
of
my
life
more
than
another
i
was
made
to
drink
the
bitterest
dregs
of
slavery
that
time
was
during
the
first
six
months
of
my
stay
with
mr
covey
we
were
worked
all
weathers
it
was
never
too
hot
or
too
cold
it
could
never
rain
blow
snow
or
hail
too
hard
for
us
to
work
in
the
field
work
work
work
was
scarcely
more
the
order
of
the
day
than
the
night
the
longest
days
were
too
short
for
him
and
the
shortest
nights
were
too
long
for
him
i
was
somewhat
unmanageable
when
i
first
went
there
but
a
few
months
of
his
discipline
tamed
me
mr
covey
succeeded
in
breaking
me
i
was
broken
in
body
soul
and
spirit
my
natural
elasticity
was
crushed
my
intellect
languished
the
disposition
to
read
departed
the
cheerful
spark
that
lingered
about
my
eye
died
the
dark
night
of
slavery
closed
in
upon
me
and
behold
a
man
transformed
into
a
brute
sunday
was
my
only
leisure
time
i
spent
this
in
a
sort
of
stupor
between
sleep
and
wake
under
some
large
tree
at
times
i
would
rise
up
a
flash
of
energetic
freedom
would
dart
through
my
soul
accompanied
with
a
faint
beam
of
hope
flickered
for
a
moment
and
then
vanished
i
sank
down
again
mourning
over
my
wretched
condition
i
was
sometimes
prompted
to
take
my
life
and
that
of
covey
but
was
prevented
by
a
combination
of
hope
and
fear
my
sufferings
on
this
plantation
seem
now
like
a
dream
rather
than
a
stern
reality
our
house
stood
within
a
few
rods
of
the
chesapeake
bay
whose
broad
bosom
was
ever
white
with
sails
from
every
quarter
of
the
habitable
globe
those
beautiful
vessels
robed
in
purest
white
so
delightful
to
the
eye
of
freemen
were
to
me
so
many
shrouded
ghosts
to
terrify
and
torment
me
with
thoughts
of
my
wretched
condition
i
have
often
in
the
deep
stillness
of
a
summer
s
sabbath
stood
all
alone
upon
the
banks
of
that
noble
bay
and
traced
with
saddened
heart
and
tearful
eye
the
countless
number
of
sails
moving
off
to
the
mighty
ocean
the
sight
of
these
always
affected
me
powerfully
my
thoughts
would
compel
utterance
and
there
with
no
audience
but
the
almighty
i
would
pour
out
my
soul
s
complaint
in
my
rude
way
with
an
apostrophe
to
the
moving
multitude
of
ships
you
are
loosed
from
your
moorings
and
free
i
am
fast
in
my
chains
and
am
a
slave
you
move
merrily
before
the
gentle
gale
and
i
sadly
before
the
bloody
whip
you
are
freedom
s
angels
that
fly
around
the
world
i
am
confined
in
bands
of
iron
o
that
i
were
free
o
that
i
were
on
one
of
your
gallant
decks
and
under
your
protecting
wing
alas
betwixt
me
and
you
the
turbid
waters
roll
go
on
go
on
o
that
i
could
also
go
could
i
but
swim
if
i
could
fly
o
why
was
i
born
a
man
of
whom
to
make
a
brute
the
glad
ship
is
gone
she
hides
in
the
dim
distance
i
am
left
in
the
hottest
hell
of
unending
slavery
o
god
save
me
god
deliver
me
let
me
be
free
is
there
any
god
why
am
i
a
slave
i
will
run
away
i
will
not
stand
it
get
caught
or
get
clear
i
ll
try
it
i
had
as
well
die
with
ague
as
with
fever
i
have
only
one
life
to
lose
i
had
as
well
be
killed
running
as
die
standing
only
think
of
it
one
hundred
miles
straight
north
and
i
am
free
try
it
yes
god
helping
me
i
will
it
can
not
be
that
i
shall
live
and
die
a
slave
i
will
take
to
the
water
this
very
bay
shall
yet
bear
me
into
freedom
the
steamboats
steered
in
a
coast
from
north
point
i
will
do
the
same
and
when
i
get
to
the
head
of
the
bay
i
will
turn
my
canoe
adrift
and
walk
straight
through
delaware
into
pennsylvania
when
i
get
there
i
shall
not
be
required
to
have
a
pass
i
will
travel
without
being
disturbed
let
but
the
first
opportunity
offer
and
come
what
will
i
am
off
meanwhile
i
will
try
to
bear
up
under
the
yoke
i
am
not
the
only
slave
in
the
world
why
should
i
fret
i
can
bear
as
much
as
any
of
them
besides
i
am
but
a
boy
and
all
boys
are
bound
to
some
one
it
may
be
that
my
misery
in
slavery
will
only
increase
my
happiness
when
i
get
free
there
is
a
better
day
i
shall
never
be
able
to
narrate
the
mental
experience
through
which
it
was
my
lot
to
pass
during
my
stay
at
covey
s
i
was
completely
wrecked
changed
and
bewildered
goaded
almost
to
madness
at
one
time
and
at
another
reconciling
myself
to
my
wretched
condition
everything
in
the
way
of
kindness
which
i
had
experienced
at
baltimore
all
my
former
hopes
and
aspirations
for
usefulness
in
the
world
and
the
happy
moments
spent
in
the
exercises
of
religion
contrasted
with
my
then
present
lot
but
increased
my
anguish
i
suffered
bodily
as
well
as
mentally
i
had
neither
sufficient
time
in
which
to
eat
or
to
sleep
except
on
sundays
the
overwork
and
the
brutal
chastisements
of
which
i
was
the
victim
combined
with
that
and
thought
am
a
slave
a
slave
for
life
a
slave
with
no
rational
ground
to
hope
for
rendered
me
a
living
embodiment
of
mental
and
physical
wretchedness

of

the
foregoing
chapter
with
all
its
horrid
incidents
and
shocking
features
may
be
taken
as
a
fair
representation
of
the
first
six
months
of
my
life
at
covey
s
the
reader
has
but
to
repeat
in
his
own
mind
once
a
week
the
scene
in
the
woods
where
covey
subjected
me
to
his
merciless
lash
to
have
a
true
idea
of
my
bitter
experience
there
during
the
first
period
of
the
breaking
process
through
which
mr
covey
carried
me
i
have
no
heart
to
repeat
each
separate
transaction
in
which
i
was
victim
of
his
violence
and
brutality
such
a
narration
would
fill
a
volume
much
larger
than
the
present
one
i
aim
only
to
give
the
reader
a
truthful
impression
of
my
slave
life
without
unnecessarily
affecting
him
with
harrowing
details
as
i
have
elsewhere
intimated
that
my
hardships
were
much
greater
during
the
first
six
months
of
my
stay
at
covey
s
than
during
the
remainder
of
the
year
and
as
the
change
in
my
condition
was
owing
to
causes
which
may
help
the
reader
to
a
better
understanding
of
human
nature
when
subjected
to
the
terrible
extremities
of
slavery
i
will
narrate
the
circumstances
of
this
change
although
i
may
seem
thereby
to
applaud
my
own
courage
you
have
dear
reader
seen
me
humbled
degraded
broken
down
enslaved
and
brutalized
and
you
understand
how
it
was
done
now
let
us
see
the
converse
of
all
this
and
how
it
was
brought
about
and
this
will
take
us
through
the
year
on
one
of
the
hottest
days
of
the
month
of
august
of
the
year
just
mentioned
had
the
reader
been
passing
through
covey
s
farm
he
might
have
seen
me
at
work
in
what
is
there
called
the
treading
yard
a
yard
upon
which
wheat
is
trodden
out
from
the
straw
by
the
horses
feet
i
was
there
at
work
feeding
the
fan
or
rather
bringing
wheat
to
the
fan
while
bill
smith
was
feeding
our
force
consisted
of
bill
hughes
bill
smith
and
a
slave
by
the
name
of
eli
the
latter
having
been
hired
for
this
occasion
the
work
was
simple
and
required
strength
and
activity
rather
than
any
skill
or
intelligence
and
yet
to
one
entirely
unused
to
such
work
it
came
very
hard
the
heat
was
intense
and
overpowering
and
there
was
much
hurry
to
get
the
wheat
trodden
out
that
day
through
the
fan
since
if
that
work
was
done
an
hour
before
sundown
the
hands
would
have
according
to
a
promise
of
covey
that
hour
added
to
their
night
s
rest
i
was
not
behind
any
of
them
in
the
wish
to
complete
the
day
s
work
before
sundown
and
hence
i
struggled
with
all
my
might
to
get
the
work
forward
the
promise
of
one
hour
s
repose
on
a
week
day
was
sufficient
to
quicken
my
pace
and
to
spur
me
on
to
extra
endeavor
besides
we
had
all
planned
to
go
fishing
and
i
certainly
wished
to
have
a
hand
in
that
but
i
was
disappointed
and
the
day
turned
out
to
be
one
of
the
bitterest
i
ever
experienced
about
three
o
clock
while
the
sun
was
pouring
down
his
burning
rays
and
not
a
breeze
was
stirring
i
broke
down
my
strength
failed
me
i
was
seized
with
a
violent
aching
of
the
head
attended
with
extreme
dizziness
and
trembling
in
every
limb
finding
what
was
coming
and
feeling
it
would
never
do
to
stop
work
i
nerved
myself
up
and
staggered
on
until
i
fell
by
the
side
of
the
wheat
fan
feeling
that
the
earth
had
fallen
upon
me
this
brought
the
entire
work
to
a
dead
stand
there
was
work
for
four
each
one
had
his
part
to
perform
and
each
part
depended
on
the
other
so
that
when
one
stopped
all
were
compelled
to
stop
covey
who
had
now
become
my
dread
as
well
as
my
tormentor
was
at
the
house
about
a
hundred
yards
from
where
i
was
fanning
and
instantly
upon
hearing
the
fan
stop
he
came
down
to
the
treading
yard
to
inquire
into
the
cause
of
our
stopping
bill
smith
told
him
i
was
sick
and
that
i
was
unable
longer
to
bring
wheat
to
the
fan
i
had
by
this
time
crawled
away
under
the
side
of
a
fence
in
the
shade
and
was
exceeding
ill
the
intense
heat
of
the
sun
the
heavy
dust
rising
from
the
fan
the
stooping
to
take
up
the
wheat
from
the
yard
together
with
the
hurrying
to
get
through
had
caused
a
rush
of
blood
to
my
head
in
this
condition
covey
finding
out
where
i
was
came
to
me
and
after
standing
over
me
a
while
he
asked
me
what
the
matter
was
i
told
him
as
well
as
i
could
for
it
was
with
difficulty
that
i
could
speak
he
then
gave
me
a
savage
kick
in
the
side
which
jarred
my
whole
frame
and
commanded
me
to
get
up
the
man
had
obtained
complete
control
over
me
and
if
he
had
commanded
me
to
do
any
possible
thing
i
should
in
my
then
state
of
mind
have
endeavored
to
comply
i
made
an
effort
to
rise
but
fell
back
in
the
attempt
before
gaining
my
feet
the
brute
now
gave
me
another
heavy
kick
and
again
told
me
to
rise
i
again
tried
to
rise
and
succeeded
in
gaining
my
feet
but
upon
stooping
to
get
the
tub
with
which
i
was
feeding
the
fan
i
again
staggered
and
fell
to
the
ground
and
i
must
have
so
fallen
had
i
been
sure
that
a
hundred
bullets
would
have
pierced
me
as
the
consequence
while
down
in
this
sad
condition
and
perfectly
helpless
the
merciless
negro
breaker
took
up
the
hickory
slab
with
which
hughes
had
been
striking
off
the
wheat
to
a
level
with
the
sides
of
the
half
bushel
measure
a
very
hard
weapon
and
with
the
sharp
edge
of
it
he
dealt
me
a
heavy
blow
on
my
head
which
made
a
large
gash
and
caused
the
blood
to
run
freely
saying
at
the
same
time
if
have
got
the
headache
i
ll
cure
this
done
he
ordered
me
again
to
rise
but
i
made
no
effort
to
do
so
for
i
had
made
up
my
mind
that
it
was
useless
and
that
the
heartless
monster
might
now
do
his
worst
he
could
but
kill
me
and
that
might
put
me
out
of
my
misery
finding
me
unable
to
rise
or
rather
despairing
of
my
doing
so
covey
left
me
with
a
view
to
getting
on
with
the
work
without
me
i
was
bleeding
very
freely
and
my
face
was
soon
covered
with
my
warm
blood
cruel
and
merciless
as
was
the
motive
that
dealt
that
blow
dear
reader
the
wound
was
fortunate
for
me
bleeding
was
never
more
efficacious
the
pain
in
my
head
speedily
abated
and
i
was
soon
able
to
rise
covey
had
as
i
have
said
now
left
me
to
my
fate
and
the
question
was
shall
i
return
to
my
work
or
shall
i
find
my
way
to
michael
s
and
make
capt
auld
acquainted
with
the
atrocious
cruelty
of
his
brother
covey
and
beseech
him
to
get
me
another
master
remembering
the
object
he
had
in
view
in
placing
me
under
the
management
of
covey
and
further
his
cruel
treatment
of
my
poor
crippled
cousin
henny
and
his
meanness
in
the
matter
of
feeding
and
clothing
his
slaves
there
was
little
ground
to
hope
for
a
favorable
reception
at
the
hands
of
capt
thomas
auld
nevertheless
i
resolved
to
go
straight
to
capt
auld
thinking
that
if
not
animated
by
motives
of
humanity
he
might
be
induced
to
interfere
on
my
behalf
from
selfish
considerations
he
can
not
thought
i
allow
his
property
to
be
thus
bruised
and
battered
marred
and
defaced
and
i
will
go
to
him
and
tell
him
the
simple
truth
about
the
in
order
to
get
to
michael
s
by
the
most
favorable
and
direct
road
i
must
walk
seven
miles
and
this
in
my
sad
condition
was
no
easy
performance
i
had
already
lost
much
blood
i
was
exhausted
by
over
exertion
my
sides
were
sore
from
the
heavy
blows
planted
there
by
the
stout
boots
of
mr
covey
and
i
was
in
every
way
in
an
unfavorable
plight
for
the
journey
i
however
watched
my
chance
while
the
cruel
and
cunning
covey
was
looking
in
an
opposite
direction
and
started
off
across
the
field
for
michael
s
this
was
a
daring
step
if
it
failed
it
would
only
exasperate
covey
and
increase
the
rigors
of
my
bondage
during
the
remainder
of
my
term
of
service
under
him
but
the
step
was
taken
and
i
must
go
forward
i
succeeded
in
getting
nearly
half
way
across
the
broad
field
toward
the
woods
before
mr
covey
observed
me
i
was
still
bleeding
and
the
exertion
of
running
had
started
the
blood
afresh
come
back
come
back
vociferated
covey
with
threats
of
what
he
would
do
if
i
did
not
return
instantly
but
disregarding
his
calls
and
his
threats
i
pressed
on
toward
the
woods
as
fast
as
my
feeble
state
would
allow
seeing
no
signs
of
my
stopping
covey
caused
his
horse
to
be
brought
out
and
saddled
as
if
he
intended
to
pursue
me
the
race
was
now
to
be
an
unequal
one
and
thinking
i
might
be
overhauled
by
him
if
i
kept
the
main
road
i
walked
nearly
the
whole
distance
in
the
woods
keeping
far
enough
from
the
road
to
avoid
detection
and
pursuit
but
i
had
not
gone
far
before
my
little
strength
again
failed
me
and
i
laid
down
the
blood
was
still
oozing
from
the
wound
in
my
head
and
for
a
time
i
suffered
more
than
i
can
describe
there
i
was
in
the
deep
woods
sick
and
emaciated
pursued
by
a
wretch
whose
character
for
revolting
cruelty
beggars
all
opprobrious
speech
bleeding
and
almost
bloodless
i
was
not
without
the
fear
of
bleeding
to
death
the
thought
of
dying
in
the
woods
all
alone
and
of
being
torn
to
pieces
by
the
buzzards
had
not
yet
been
rendered
tolerable
by
my
many
troubles
and
hardships
and
i
was
glad
when
the
shade
of
the
trees
and
the
cool
evening
breeze
combined
with
my
matted
hair
to
stop
the
flow
of
blood
after
lying
there
about
three
quarters
of
an
hour
brooding
over
the
singular
and
mournful
lot
to
which
i
was
doomed
my
mind
passing
over
the
whole
scale
or
circle
of
belief
and
unbelief
from
faith
in
the
overruling
providence
of
god
to
the
blackest
atheism
i
again
took
up
my
journey
toward
michael
s
more
weary
and
sad
than
in
the
morning
when
i
left
thomas
auld
s
for
the
home
of
mr
covey
i
was
and
and
in
my
shirt
sleeves
the
way
was
through
bogs
and
briers
and
i
tore
my
feet
often
during
the
journey
i
was
full
five
hours
in
going
the
seven
or
eight
miles
partly
because
of
the
difficulties
of
the
way
and
partly
because
of
the
feebleness
induced
by
my
illness
bruises
and
loss
of
blood
on
gaining
my
master
s
store
i
presented
an
appearance
of
wretchedness
and
woe
fitted
to
move
any
but
a
heart
of
stone
from
the
crown
of
my
head
to
the
sole
of
my
feet
there
were
marks
of
blood
my
hair
was
all
clotted
with
dust
and
blood
and
the
back
of
my
shirt
was
literally
stiff
with
the
same
briers
and
thorns
had
scarred
and
torn
my
feet
and
legs
leaving
blood
marks
there
had
i
escaped
from
a
den
of
tigers
i
could
not
have
looked
worse
than
i
did
on
reaching
michael
s
in
this
unhappy
plight
i
appeared
before
my
professedly
master
humbly
to
invoke
the
interposition
of
his
power
and
authority
to
protect
me
from
further
abuse
and
violence
i
had
begun
to
hope
during
the
latter
part
of
my
tedious
journey
toward
michael
s
that
capt
auld
would
now
show
himself
in
a
nobler
light
than
i
had
ever
before
seen
him
i
was
disappointed
i
had
jumped
from
a
sinking
ship
into
the
sea
i
had
fled
from
the
tiger
to
something
worse
i
told
him
all
the
circumstances
as
well
as
i
could
how
i
was
endeavoring
to
please
covey
how
hard
i
was
at
work
in
the
present
instance
how
unwilling
i
sunk
down
under
the
heat
toil
and
pain
the
brutal
manner
in
which
covey
had
kicked
me
in
the
side
the
gash
cut
in
my
head
my
hesitation
about
troubling
him
capt
auld
with
complaints
but
that
now
i
felt
it
would
not
be
best
longer
to
conceal
from
him
the
outrages
committed
on
me
from
time
to
time
by
covey
at
first
master
thomas
seemed
somewhat
affected
by
the
story
of
my
wrongs
but
he
soon
repressed
his
feelings
and
became
cold
as
iron
it
was
impossible
as
i
stood
before
him
at
the
first
for
him
to
seem
indifferent
i
distinctly
saw
his
human
nature
asserting
its
conviction
against
the
slave
system
which
made
cases
like
mine
but
as
i
have
said
humanity
fell
before
the
systematic
tyranny
of
slavery
he
first
walked
the
floor
apparently
much
agitated
by
my
story
and
the
sad
spectacle
i
presented
but
presently
it
was
turn
to
talk
he
began
moderately
by
finding
excuses
for
covey
and
ending
with
a
full
justification
of
him
and
a
passionate
condemnation
of
me
he
had
no
doubt
i
deserved
the
flogging
he
did
not
believe
i
was
sick
i
was
only
endeavoring
to
get
rid
of
work
my
dizziness
was
laziness
and
covey
did
right
to
flog
me
as
he
had
after
thus
fairly
annihilating
me
and
rousing
himself
by
his
own
eloquence
he
fiercely
demanded
what
i
wished
to
do
in
the
case
with
such
a
complete
to
all
my
hopes
as
he
had
given
me
and
feeling
as
i
did
my
entire
subjection
to
his
power
i
had
very
little
heart
to
reply
i
must
not
affirm
my
innocence
of
the
allegations
which
he
had
piled
up
against
me
for
that
would
be
impudence
and
would
probably
call
down
fresh
violence
as
well
as
wrath
upon
me
the
guilt
of
a
slave
is
always
and
everywhere
presumed
and
the
innocence
of
the
slaveholder
or
the
slave
employer
is
always
asserted
the
word
of
the
slave
against
this
presumption
is
generally
treated
as
impudence
worthy
of
punishment
do
you
contradict
me
you
rascal
is
a
final
silencer
of
counter
statements
from
the
lips
of
a
slave
calming
down
a
little
in
view
of
my
silence
and
hesitation
and
perhaps
from
a
rapid
glance
at
the
picture
of
misery
i
presented
he
inquired
again
what
i
would
have
him
do
thus
invited
a
second
time
i
told
master
thomas
i
wished
him
to
allow
me
to
get
a
new
home
and
to
find
a
new
master
that
as
sure
as
i
went
back
to
live
with
mr
covey
again
i
should
be
killed
by
him
that
he
would
never
forgive
my
coming
to
him
capt
auld
with
a
complaint
against
him
covey
that
since
i
had
lived
with
him
he
almost
crushed
my
spirit
and
i
believed
that
he
would
ruin
me
for
future
service
that
my
life
was
not
safe
in
his
hands
this
master
thomas
my
brother
in
the
church
regarded
as
nonsence
sic
there
was
no
danger
of
covey
s
killing
me
he
was
a
good
man
industrious
and
religious
and
he
would
not
think
of
removing
me
from
that
home
besides
said
he
and
this
i
found
was
the
most
distressing
thought
of
all
to
him
if
you
should
leave
covey
now
that
your
year
has
but
half
expired
i
should
lose
your
wages
for
the
entire
year
you
belong
to
mr
covey
for
one
year
and
you
go
to
him
come
what
will
you
must
not
trouble
me
with
any
more
stories
about
mr
covey
and
if
you
do
not
go
immediately
home
i
will
get
hold
of
you
this
was
just
what
i
expected
when
i
found
he
had
the
case
against
me
but
sir
i
said
i
am
sick
and
tired
and
i
can
not
get
home
at
this
he
again
relented
and
finally
he
allowed
me
to
remain
all
night
at
michael
s
but
said
i
must
be
off
early
in
the
morning
and
concluded
his
directions
by
making
me
swallow
a
huge
dose
of
about
the
only
medicine
ever
administered
to
slaves
it
was
quite
natural
for
master
thomas
to
presume
i
was
feigning
sickness
to
escape
work
for
he
probably
thought
that
were
in
the
place
of
a
slave
with
no
wages
for
his
work
no
praise
for
well
doing
no
motive
for
toil
but
the
lash
he
would
try
every
possible
scheme
by
which
to
escape
labor
i
say
i
have
no
doubt
of
this
the
reason
is
that
there
are
not
under
the
whole
heavens
a
set
of
men
who
cultivate
such
an
intense
dread
of
labor
as
do
the
slaveholders
the
charge
of
laziness
against
the
slave
is
ever
on
their
lips
and
is
the
standing
apology
for
every
species
of
cruelty
and
brutality
these
men
literally
bind
heavy
burdens
grievous
to
be
borne
and
lay
them
on
men
s
shoulders
but
they
themselves
will
not
move
them
with
one
of
their
my
kind
readers
shall
have
in
the
next
chapter
what
they
were
led
perhaps
to
expect
to
find
in
this
namely
an
account
of
my
partial
disenthrallment
from
the
tyranny
of
covey

the
marked
change
which
it

to
the
relief
of
the
weary
in
body
and
the
broken
in
spirit
especially
when
past
troubles
only
foreshadow
coming
disasters
the
last
hope
had
been
extinguished
my
master
who
i
did
not
venture
to
hope
would
protect
me
as
had
even
now
refused
to
protect
me
as
property
and
had
cast
me
back
covered
with
reproaches
and
bruises
into
the
hands
of
a
stranger
to
that
mercy
which
was
the
soul
of
the
religion
he
professed
may
the
reader
never
spend
such
a
night
as
that
allotted
to
me
previous
to
the
morning
which
was
to
herald
my
return
to
the
den
of
horrors
from
which
i
had
made
a
temporary
escape
i
remained
all
night
sleep
i
did
not
at
michael
s
and
in
the
morning
saturday
i
started
off
according
to
the
order
of
master
thomas
feeling
that
i
had
no
friend
on
earth
and
doubting
if
i
had
one
in
heaven
i
reached
covey
s
about
nine
o
clock
and
just
as
i
stepped
into
the
field
before
i
had
reached
the
house
covey
true
to
his
snakish
habits
darted
out
at
me
from
a
fence
corner
in
which
he
had
secreted
himself
for
the
purpose
of
securing
me
he
was
amply
provided
with
a
cowskin
and
a
rope
and
he
evidently
intended
to
me
and
to
wreak
his
vengeance
on
me
to
the
fullest
extent
i
should
have
been
an
easy
prey
had
he
succeeded
in
getting
his
hands
upon
me
for
i
had
taken
no
refreshment
since
noon
on
friday
and
this
together
with
the
pelting
excitement
and
the
loss
of
blood
had
reduced
my
strength
i
however
darted
back
into
the
woods
before
the
ferocious
hound
could
get
hold
of
me
and
buried
myself
in
a
thicket
where
he
lost
sight
of
me
the
afforded
me
cover
in
getting
to
the
woods
but
for
the
tall
corn
covey
would
have
overtaken
me
and
made
me
his
captive
he
seemed
very
much
chagrined
that
he
did
not
catch
me
and
gave
up
the
chase
very
reluctantly
for
i
could
see
his
angry
movements
toward
the
house
from
which
he
had
sallied
on
his
foray
well
now
i
am
clear
of
covey
and
of
his
wrathful
lash
for
present
i
am
in
the
wood
buried
in
its
somber
gloom
and
hushed
in
its
solemn
silence
hid
from
all
human
eyes
shut
in
with
nature
and
nature
s
god
and
absent
from
all
human
contrivances
here
was
a
good
place
to
pray
to
pray
for
help
for
deliverance
a
prayer
i
had
often
made
before
but
how
could
i
pray
covey
could
pray
capt
auld
could
pray
i
would
fain
pray
but
doubts
arising
partly
from
my
own
neglect
of
the
means
of
grace
and
partly
from
the
sham
religion
which
everywhere
prevailed
cast
in
my
mind
a
doubt
upon
all
religion
and
led
me
to
the
conviction
that
prayers
were
unavailing
and
delusive
prevented
my
embracing
the
opportunity
as
a
religious
one
life
in
itself
had
almost
become
burdensome
to
me
all
my
outward
relations
were
against
me
i
must
stay
here
and
starve
i
was
already
hungry
or
go
home
to
covey
s
and
have
my
flesh
torn
to
pieces
and
my
spirit
humbled
under
the
cruel
lash
of
covey
this
was
the
painful
alternative
presented
to
me
the
day
was
long
and
irksome
my
physical
condition
was
deplorable
i
was
weak
from
the
toils
of
the
previous
day
and
from
the
want
of
food
and
rest
and
had
been
so
little
concerned
about
my
appearance
that
i
had
not
yet
washed
the
blood
from
my
garments
i
was
an
object
of
horror
even
to
myself
life
in
baltimore
when
most
oppressive
was
a
paradise
to
this
what
had
i
done
what
had
my
parents
done
that
such
a
life
as
this
should
be
mine
that
day
in
the
woods
i
would
have
exchanged
my
manhood
for
the
brutehood
of
an
ox
night
came
i
was
still
in
the
woods
unresolved
what
to
do
hunger
had
not
yet
pinched
me
to
the
point
of
going
home
and
i
laid
myself
down
in
the
leaves
to
rest
for
i
had
been
watching
for
hunters
all
day
but
not
being
molested
during
the
day
i
expected
no
disturbance
during
the
night
i
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
covey
relied
upon
hunger
to
drive
me
home
and
in
this
i
was
quite
correct
the
facts
showed
that
he
had
made
no
effort
to
catch
me
since
morning
during
the
night
i
heard
the
step
of
a
man
in
the
woods
he
was
coming
toward
the
place
where
i
lay
a
person
lying
still
has
the
advantage
over
one
walking
in
the
woods
in
the
day
time
and
this
advantage
is
much
greater
at
night
i
was
not
able
to
engage
in
a
physical
struggle
and
i
had
recourse
to
the
common
resort
of
the
weak
i
hid
myself
in
the
leaves
to
prevent
discovery
but
as
the
night
rambler
in
the
woods
drew
nearer
i
found
him
to
be
a
not
an
enemy
it
was
a
slave
of
william
groomes
of
easton
a
kind
hearted
fellow
named
sandy
lived
with
kemp
that
year
about
four
miles
from
michael
s
he
like
myself
had
been
hired
out
by
the
year
but
unlike
myself
had
not
been
hired
out
to
be
broken
sandy
was
the
husband
of
a
free
woman
who
lived
in
the
lower
part
of
potpie
neck
and
he
was
now
on
his
way
through
the
woods
to
see
her
and
to
spend
the
sabbath
with
her
as
soon
as
i
had
ascertained
that
the
disturber
of
my
solitude
was
not
an
enemy
but
the
sandy
a
man
as
famous
among
the
slaves
of
the
neighborhood
for
his
good
nature
as
for
his
good
sense
i
came
out
from
my
hiding
place
and
made
myself
known
to
him
i
explained
the
circumstances
of
the
past
two
days
which
had
driven
me
to
the
woods
and
he
deeply
compassionated
my
distress
it
was
a
bold
thing
for
him
to
shelter
me
and
i
could
not
ask
him
to
do
so
for
had
i
been
found
in
his
hut
he
would
have
suffered
the
penalty
of
lashes
on
his
bare
back
if
not
something
worse
but
sandy
was
too
generous
to
permit
the
fear
of
punishment
to
prevent
his
relieving
a
brother
bondman
from
hunger
and
exposure
and
therefore
on
his
own
motion
i
accompanied
him
to
his
home
or
rather
to
the
home
of
his
wife
for
the
house
and
lot
were
hers
his
wife
was
called
up
for
it
was
now
about
midnight
a
fire
was
made
some
indian
meal
was
soon
mixed
with
salt
and
water
and
an
ash
cake
was
baked
in
a
hurry
to
relieve
my
hunger
sandy
s
wife
was
not
behind
him
in
kindness
both
seemed
to
esteem
it
a
privilege
to
succor
me
for
although
i
was
hated
by
covey
and
by
my
master
i
was
loved
by
the
colored
people
because
thought
i
was
hated
for
my
knowledge
and
persecuted
because
i
was
feared
i
was
the
slave
in
that
region
who
could
read
and
write
there
had
been
one
other
man
belonging
to
hugh
hamilton
who
could
read
his
name
was
jim
but
he
poor
fellow
had
shortly
after
my
coming
into
the
neighborhood
been
sold
off
to
the
far
south
i
saw
jim
ironed
in
the
cart
to
be
carried
to
easton
for
sale
pinioned
like
a
yearling
for
the
slaughter
my
knowledge
was
now
the
pride
of
my
brother
slaves
and
no
doubt
sandy
felt
something
of
the
general
interest
in
me
on
that
account
the
supper
was
soon
ready
and
though
i
have
feasted
since
with
honorables
lord
mayors
and
aldermen
over
the
sea
my
supper
on
ash
cake
and
cold
water
with
sandy
was
the
meal
of
all
my
life
most
sweet
to
my
taste
and
now
most
vivid
in
my
memory
supper
over
sandy
and
i
went
into
a
discussion
of
what
was
for
me
under
the
perils
and
hardships
which
now
overshadowed
my
path
the
question
was
must
i
go
back
to
covey
or
must
i
now
tempt
to
run
away
upon
a
careful
survey
the
latter
was
found
to
be
impossible
for
i
was
on
a
narrow
neck
of
land
every
avenue
from
which
would
bring
me
in
sight
of
pursuers
there
was
the
chesapeake
bay
to
the
right
and
river
to
the
left
and
michael
s
and
its
neighborhood
occupying
the
only
space
through
which
there
was
any
retreat
i
found
sandy
an
old
advisor
he
was
not
only
a
religious
man
but
he
professed
to
believe
in
a
system
for
which
i
have
no
name
he
was
a
genuine
african
and
had
inherited
some
of
the
magical
powers
said
to
be
possessed
by
african
and
eastern
nations
he
told
me
that
he
could
help
me
that
in
those
very
woods
there
was
an
herb
which
in
the
morning
might
be
found
possessing
all
the
powers
required
for
my
protection
i
put
his
thoughts
in
my
own
language
and
that
if
i
would
take
his
advice
he
would
procure
me
the
root
of
the
herb
of
which
he
spoke
he
told
me
further
that
if
i
would
take
that
root
and
wear
it
on
my
right
side
it
would
be
impossible
for
covey
to
strike
me
a
blow
that
with
this
root
about
my
person
no
white
man
could
whip
me
he
said
he
had
carried
it
for
years
and
that
he
had
fully
tested
its
virtues
he
had
never
received
a
blow
from
a
slaveholder
since
he
carried
it
and
he
never
expected
to
receive
one
for
he
always
meant
to
carry
that
root
as
a
protection
he
knew
covey
well
for
mrs
covey
was
the
daughter
of
kemp
and
he
sandy
had
heard
of
the
barbarous
treatment
to
which
i
was
subjected
and
he
wanted
to
do
something
for
me
now
all
this
talk
about
the
root
was
to
me
very
absurd
and
ridiculous
if
not
positively
sinful
i
at
first
rejected
the
idea
that
the
simple
carrying
a
root
on
my
right
side
a
root
by
the
way
over
which
i
walked
every
time
i
went
into
the
woods
could
possess
any
such
magic
power
as
he
ascribed
to
it
and
i
was
therefore
not
disposed
to
cumber
my
pocket
with
it
i
had
a
positive
aversion
to
all
pretenders
to
it
was
beneath
one
of
my
intelligence
to
countenance
such
dealings
with
the
devil
as
this
power
implied
but
with
all
my
learning
it
was
really
precious
little
sandy
was
more
than
a
match
for
me
my
book
learning
he
said
had
not
kept
covey
off
me
a
powerful
argument
just
then
and
he
entreated
me
with
flashing
eyes
to
try
this
if
it
did
me
no
good
it
could
do
me
no
harm
and
it
would
cost
me
nothing
any
way
sandy
was
so
earnest
and
so
confident
of
the
good
qualities
of
this
weed
that
to
please
him
rather
than
from
any
conviction
of
its
excellence
i
was
induced
to
take
it
he
had
been
to
me
the
good
samaritan
and
had
almost
providentially
found
me
and
helped
me
when
i
could
not
help
myself
how
did
i
know
but
that
the
hand
of
the
lord
was
in
it
with
thoughts
of
this
sort
i
took
the
roots
from
sandy
and
put
them
in
my
right
hand
pocket
this
was
of
course
sunday
morning
sandy
now
urged
me
to
go
home
with
all
speed
and
to
walk
up
bravely
to
the
house
as
though
nothing
had
happened
i
saw
in
sandy
too
deep
an
insight
into
human
nature
with
all
his
superstition
not
to
have
some
respect
for
his
advice
and
perhaps
too
a
slight
gleam
or
shadow
of
his
superstition
had
fallen
upon
me
at
any
rate
i
started
off
toward
covey
s
as
directed
by
sandy
having
the
previous
night
poured
my
griefs
into
sandy
s
ears
and
got
him
enlisted
in
my
behalf
having
made
his
wife
a
sharer
in
my
sorrows
and
having
also
become
well
refreshed
by
sleep
and
food
i
moved
off
quite
courageously
toward
the
much
dreaded
covey
s
singularly
enough
just
as
i
entered
his
yard
gate
i
met
him
and
his
wife
dressed
in
their
sunday
best
looking
as
smiling
as
angels
on
their
way
to
church
the
manner
of
covey
astonished
me
there
was
something
really
benignant
in
his
countenance
he
spoke
to
me
as
never
before
told
me
that
the
pigs
had
got
into
the
lot
and
he
wished
me
to
drive
them
out
inquired
how
i
was
and
seemed
an
altered
man
this
extraordinary
conduct
of
covey
really
made
me
begin
to
think
that
sandy
s
herb
had
more
virtue
in
it
than
i
in
my
pride
had
been
willing
to
allow
and
had
the
day
been
other
than
sunday
i
should
have
attributed
covey
s
altered
manner
solely
to
the
magic
power
of
the
root
i
suspected
however
that
the
and
not
the
was
the
real
explanation
of
covey
s
manner
his
religion
hindered
him
from
breaking
the
sabbath
but
not
from
breaking
my
skin
he
had
more
respect
for
the
than
for
the
for
whom
the
day
was
mercifully
given
for
while
he
would
cut
and
slash
my
body
during
the
week
he
would
not
hesitate
on
sunday
to
teach
me
the
value
of
my
soul
or
the
way
of
life
and
salvation
by
jesus
christ
all
went
well
with
me
till
monday
morning
and
then
whether
the
root
had
lost
its
virtue
or
whether
my
tormentor
had
gone
deeper
into
the
black
art
than
myself
as
was
sometimes
said
of
him
or
whether
he
had
obtained
a
special
indulgence
for
his
faithful
sabbath
day
s
worship
it
is
not
necessary
for
me
to
know
or
to
inform
the
reader
but
this
i
say
the
pious
and
benignant
smile
which
graced
covey
s
face
on
wholly
disappeared
on
long
before
daylight
i
was
called
up
to
go
and
feed
rub
and
curry
the
horses
i
obeyed
the
call
and
would
have
so
obeyed
it
had
it
been
made
at
an
earilier
sic
hour
for
i
had
brought
my
mind
to
a
firm
resolve
during
that
sunday
s
reflection
viz
to
obey
every
order
however
unreasonable
if
it
were
possible
and
if
mr
covey
should
then
undertake
to
beat
me
to
defend
and
protect
myself
to
the
best
of
my
ability
my
religious
views
on
the
subject
of
resisting
my
master
had
suffered
a
serious
shock
by
the
savage
persecution
to
which
i
had
been
subjected
and
my
hands
were
no
longer
tied
by
my
religion
master
thomas
s
indifference
had
served
the
last
link
i
had
now
to
this
extent
backslidden
from
this
point
in
the
slave
s
religious
creed
and
i
soon
had
occasion
to
make
my
fallen
state
known
to
my
brother
covey
whilst
i
was
obeying
his
order
to
feed
and
get
the
horses
ready
for
the
field
and
when
in
the
act
of
going
up
the
stable
loft
for
the
purpose
of
throwing
down
some
blades
covey
sneaked
into
the
stable
in
his
peculiar
way
and
seizing
me
suddenly
by
the
leg
he
brought
me
to
the
stable
floor
giving
my
newly
mended
body
a
fearful
jar
i
now
forgot
my
roots
and
remembered
my
pledge
to
up
in
my
own
the
brute
was
endeavoring
skillfully
to
get
a
on
my
legs
before
i
could
draw
up
my
feet
as
soon
as
i
found
what
he
was
up
to
i
gave
a
sudden
spring
my
two
day
s
rest
had
been
of
much
service
to
me
and
by
that
means
no
doubt
he
was
able
to
bring
me
to
the
floor
so
heavily
he
was
defeated
in
his
plan
of
tying
me
while
down
he
seemed
to
think
he
had
me
very
securely
in
his
power
he
little
thought
he
was
as
the
rowdies
say
in
for
a
rough
and
tumble
fight
but
such
was
the
fact
whence
came
the
daring
spirit
necessary
to
grapple
with
a
man
who
hours
before
could
with
his
slightest
word
have
made
me
tremble
like
a
leaf
in
a
storm
i
do
not
know
at
any
rate
was
resolved
to
and
what
was
better
still
i
was
actually
hard
at
it
the
fighting
madness
had
come
upon
me
and
i
found
my
strong
fingers
firmly
attached
to
the
throat
of
my
cowardly
tormentor
as
heedless
of
consequences
at
the
moment
as
though
we
stood
as
equals
before
the
law
the
very
color
of
the
man
was
forgotten
i
felt
as
supple
as
a
cat
and
was
ready
for
the
snakish
creature
at
every
turn
every
blow
of
his
was
parried
though
i
dealt
no
blows
in
turn
i
was
strictly
on
the
preventing
him
from
injuring
me
rather
than
trying
to
injure
him
i
flung
him
on
the
ground
several
times
when
he
meant
to
have
hurled
me
there
i
held
him
so
firmly
by
the
throat
that
his
blood
followed
my
nails
he
held
me
and
i
held
him
all
was
fair
thus
far
and
the
contest
was
about
equal
my
resistance
was
entirely
unexpected
and
covey
was
taken
all
aback
by
it
for
he
trembled
in
every
limb
are
you
going
to
you
scoundrel
said
he
to
which
i
returned
a
polite
yes
sir
steadily
gazing
my
interrogator
in
the
eye
to
meet
the
first
approach
or
dawning
of
the
blow
which
i
expected
my
answer
would
call
forth
but
the
conflict
did
not
long
remain
thus
equal
covey
soon
cried
out
lustily
for
help
not
that
i
was
obtaining
any
marked
advantage
over
him
or
was
injuring
him
but
because
he
was
gaining
none
over
me
and
was
not
able
single
handed
to
conquer
me
he
called
for
his
cousin
hughs
to
come
to
his
assistance
and
now
the
scene
was
changed
i
was
compelled
to
give
blows
as
well
as
to
parry
them
and
since
i
was
in
any
case
to
suffer
for
resistance
i
felt
as
the
musty
proverb
goes
that
i
might
as
well
be
hanged
for
an
old
sheep
as
a
i
was
still
toward
covey
but
toward
hughs
and
at
the
first
approach
of
the
latter
i
dealt
a
blow
in
my
desperation
which
fairly
sickened
my
youthful
assailant
he
went
off
bending
over
with
pain
and
manifesting
no
disposition
to
come
within
my
reach
again
the
poor
fellow
was
in
the
act
of
trying
to
catch
and
tie
my
right
hand
and
while
flattering
himself
with
success
i
gave
him
the
kick
which
sent
him
staggering
away
in
pain
at
the
same
time
that
i
held
covey
with
a
firm
hand
taken
completely
by
surprise
covey
seemed
to
have
lost
his
usual
strength
and
coolness
he
was
frightened
and
stood
puffing
and
blowing
seemingly
unable
to
command
words
or
blows
when
he
saw
that
poor
hughes
was
standing
half
bent
with
pain
his
courage
quite
gone
the
cowardly
tyrant
asked
if
i
meant
to
persist
in
my
i
told
him
did
mean
to
resist
come
what
that
i
had
been
by
him
treated
like
a
during
the
last
six
months
and
that
i
should
stand
it
with
that
he
gave
me
a
shake
and
attempted
to
drag
me
toward
a
stick
of
wood
that
was
lying
just
outside
the
stable
door
he
meant
to
knock
me
down
with
it
but
just
as
he
leaned
over
to
get
the
stick
i
seized
him
with
both
hands
by
the
collar
and
with
a
vigorous
and
sudden
snatch
i
brought
my
assailant
harmlessly
his
full
length
on
the
overclean
ground
for
we
were
now
in
the
cow
yard
he
had
selected
the
place
for
the
fight
and
it
was
but
right
that
he
should
have
all
the
advantges
sic
of
his
own
selection
by
this
time
bill
the
hiredman
came
home
he
had
been
to
hemsley
s
to
spend
the
sunday
with
his
nominal
wife
and
was
coming
home
on
monday
morning
to
go
to
work
covey
and
i
had
been
skirmishing
from
before
daybreak
till
now
that
the
sun
was
almost
shooting
his
beams
over
the
eastern
woods
and
we
were
still
at
it
i
could
not
see
where
the
matter
was
to
terminate
he
evidently
was
afraid
to
let
me
go
lest
i
should
again
make
off
to
the
woods
otherwise
he
would
probably
have
obtained
arms
from
the
house
to
frighten
me
holding
me
covey
called
upon
bill
for
assistance
the
scene
here
had
something
comic
about
it
bill
who
knew
what
covey
wished
him
to
do
affected
ignorance
and
pretended
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
what
shall
i
do
covey
said
bill
take
hold
of
him
take
hold
of
him
said
covey
with
a
toss
of
his
head
peculiar
to
bill
he
said
indeed
mr
covey
i
want
to
go
to
this
your
work
said
covey
take
hold
of
bill
replied
with
spirit
my
master
hired
me
here
to
work
and
to
help
you
whip
it
was
now
my
turn
to
speak
bill
said
i
don
t
put
your
hands
on
to
which
he
replied
my
god
frederick
i
ain
t
goin
to
tech
ye
and
bill
walked
off
leaving
covey
and
myself
to
settle
our
matters
as
best
we
might
but
my
present
advantage
was
threatened
when
i
saw
caroline
the
of
covey
coming
to
the
cow
yard
to
milk
for
she
was
a
powerful
woman
and
could
have
mastered
me
very
easily
exhausted
as
i
now
was
as
soon
as
she
came
into
the
yard
covey
attempted
to
rally
her
to
his
aid
strangely
and
i
may
add
fortunately
caroline
was
in
no
humor
to
take
a
hand
in
any
such
sport
we
were
all
in
open
rebellion
that
morning
caroline
answered
the
command
of
her
master
to
take
hold
of
me
precisely
as
bill
had
answered
but
in
it
was
at
greater
peril
so
to
answer
she
was
the
slave
of
covey
and
he
could
do
what
he
pleased
with
her
it
was
so
with
bill
and
bill
knew
it
samuel
harris
to
whom
bill
belonged
did
not
allow
his
slaves
to
be
beaten
unless
they
were
guilty
of
some
crime
which
the
law
would
punish
but
poor
caroline
like
myself
was
at
the
mercy
of
the
merciless
covey
nor
did
she
escape
the
dire
effects
of
her
refusal
he
gave
her
several
sharp
blows
covey
at
length
two
hours
had
elapsed
gave
up
the
contest
letting
me
go
he
said
puffing
and
blowing
at
a
great
rate
now
you
scoundrel
go
to
your
work
i
would
not
have
whipped
you
half
so
much
as
i
have
had
you
not
the
fact
was
had
not
whipped
me
at
he
had
not
in
all
the
scuffle
drawn
a
single
drop
of
blood
from
me
i
had
drawn
blood
from
him
and
even
without
this
satisfaction
i
should
have
been
victorious
because
my
aim
had
not
been
to
injure
him
but
to
prevent
his
injuring
me
during
the
whole
six
months
that
i
lived
with
covey
after
this
transaction
he
never
laid
on
me
the
weight
of
his
finger
in
anger
he
would
occasionally
say
he
did
not
want
to
have
to
get
hold
of
me
again
a
declaration
which
i
had
no
difficulty
in
believing
and
i
had
a
secret
feeling
which
answered
you
need
not
wish
to
get
hold
of
me
again
for
you
will
be
likely
to
come
off
worse
in
a
second
fight
than
you
did
in
the
well
my
dear
reader
this
battle
with
mr
covey
undignified
as
it
was
and
as
i
fear
my
narration
of
it
is
was
the
turning
point
in
my
life
as
a
it
rekindled
in
my
breast
the
smouldering
embers
of
liberty
it
brought
up
my
baltimore
dreams
and
revived
a
sense
of
my
own
manhood
i
was
a
changed
being
after
that
fight
i
was
before
i
was
a
man
now
it
recalled
to
life
my
crushed
and
my
and
inspired
me
with
a
renewed
determination
to
be
a
freeman
a
man
without
force
is
without
the
essential
dignity
of
humanity
human
nature
is
so
constituted
that
it
can
not
a
helpless
man
although
it
can
him
and
even
this
it
can
not
do
long
if
the
signs
of
power
do
not
arise
he
can
only
understand
the
effect
of
this
combat
on
my
spirit
who
has
himself
incurred
something
hazarded
something
in
repelling
the
unjust
and
cruel
aggressions
of
a
tyrant
covey
was
a
tyrant
and
a
cowardly
one
withal
after
resisting
him
i
felt
as
i
had
never
felt
before
it
was
a
resurrection
from
the
dark
and
pestiferous
tomb
of
slavery
to
the
heaven
of
comparative
freedom
i
was
no
longer
a
servile
coward
trembling
under
the
frown
of
a
brother
worm
of
the
dust
but
my
spirit
was
roused
to
an
attitude
of
manly
independence
i
had
reached
the
point
at
which
i
was
afraid
to
this
spirit
made
me
a
freeman
in
while
i
remained
a
slave
in
when
a
slave
can
not
be
flogged
he
is
more
than
half
free
he
has
a
domain
as
broad
as
his
own
manly
heart
to
defend
and
he
is
really
a
power
on
while
slaves
prefer
their
lives
with
flogging
to
instant
death
they
will
always
find
christians
enough
like
unto
covey
to
accommodate
that
preference
from
this
time
until
that
of
my
escape
from
slavery
i
was
never
fairly
whipped
several
attempts
were
made
to
whip
me
but
they
were
always
unsuccessful
bruises
i
did
get
as
i
shall
hereafter
inform
the
reader
but
the
case
i
have
been
describing
was
the
end
of
the
brutification
to
which
slavery
had
subjected
me
the
reader
will
be
glad
to
know
why
after
i
had
so
grievously
offended
mr
covey
he
did
not
have
me
taken
in
hand
by
the
authorities
indeed
why
the
law
of
maryland
which
assigns
hanging
to
the
slave
who
resists
his
master
was
not
put
in
force
against
me
at
any
rate
why
i
was
not
taken
up
as
is
usual
in
such
cases
and
publicly
whipped
for
an
example
to
other
slaves
and
as
a
means
of
deterring
me
from
committing
the
same
offense
again
i
confess
that
the
easy
manner
in
which
i
got
off
for
a
long
time
a
surprise
to
me
and
i
can
not
even
now
fully
explain
the
cause
the
only
explanation
i
can
venture
to
suggest
is
the
fact
that
covey
was
probably
ashamed
to
have
it
known
and
confessed
that
he
had
been
mastered
by
a
boy
of
sixteen
mr
covey
enjoyed
the
unbounded
and
very
valuable
reputation
of
being
a
first
rate
overseer
and
by
means
of
this
reputation
he
was
able
to
procure
his
hands
for
compensation
and
with
very
great
ease
his
interest
and
his
pride
mutually
suggested
the
wisdom
of
passing
the
matter
by
in
silence
the
story
that
he
had
undertaken
to
whip
a
lad
and
had
been
resisted
was
of
itself
sufficient
to
damage
him
for
his
bearing
should
in
the
estimation
of
slaveholders
be
of
that
imperial
order
that
should
make
such
an
occurrence
i
judge
from
these
circumstances
that
covey
deemed
it
best
to
give
me
the
it
is
perhaps
not
altogether
creditable
to
my
natural
temper
that
after
this
conflict
with
mr
covey
i
did
at
times
purposely
aim
to
provoke
him
to
an
attack
by
refusing
to
keep
with
the
other
hands
in
the
field
but
i
could
never
bully
him
to
another
battle
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
do
him
serious
damage
if
he
ever
again
attempted
to
lay
violent
hands
on
me

to

covey
ended
on
christmas
day
i
gladly
left
the
snakish
covey
although
he
was
now
as
gentle
as
a
lamb
my
home
for
the
year
was
already
secured
my
next
master
was
already
selected
there
is
always
more
or
less
excitement
about
the
matter
of
changing
hands
but
i
had
become
somewhat
reckless
i
cared
very
little
into
whose
hands
i
fell
i
meant
to
fight
my
way
despite
of
covey
too
the
report
got
abroad
that
i
was
hard
to
whip
that
i
was
guilty
of
kicking
back
that
though
generally
a
good
tempered
negro
i
sometimes
the
devil
in
these
sayings
were
rife
in
talbot
county
and
they
distinguished
me
among
my
servile
brethren
slaves
generally
will
fight
each
other
and
die
at
each
other
s
hands
but
there
are
few
who
are
not
held
in
awe
by
a
white
man
trained
from
the
cradle
up
to
think
and
feel
that
their
masters
are
superior
and
invested
with
a
sort
of
sacredness
there
are
few
who
can
outgrow
or
rise
above
the
control
which
that
sentiment
exercises
i
had
now
got
free
from
it
and
the
thing
was
known
one
bad
sheep
will
spoil
a
whole
flock
among
the
slaves
i
was
a
bad
sheep
i
hated
slavery
slaveholders
and
all
pertaining
to
them
and
i
did
not
fail
to
inspire
others
with
the
same
feeling
wherever
and
whenever
opportunity
was
presented
this
made
me
a
marked
lad
among
the
slaves
and
a
suspected
one
among
the
slaveholders
a
knowledge
of
my
ability
to
read
and
write
got
pretty
widely
spread
which
was
very
much
against
me
the
days
between
christmas
day
and
new
year
s
are
allowed
the
slaves
as
holidays
during
these
days
all
regular
work
was
suspended
and
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
keep
fires
and
look
after
the
stock
this
time
was
regarded
as
our
own
by
the
grace
of
our
masters
and
we
therefore
used
it
or
abused
it
as
we
pleased
those
who
had
families
at
a
distance
were
now
expected
to
visit
them
and
to
spend
with
them
the
entire
week
the
younger
slaves
or
the
unmarried
ones
were
expected
to
see
to
the
cattle
and
attend
to
incidental
duties
at
home
the
holidays
were
variously
spent
the
sober
thinking
and
industrious
ones
of
our
number
would
employ
themselves
in
manufacturing
corn
brooms
mats
horse
collars
and
baskets
and
some
of
these
were
very
well
made
another
class
spent
their
time
in
hunting
opossums
coons
rabbits
and
other
game
but
the
majority
spent
the
holidays
in
sports
ball
playing
wrestling
boxing
running
foot
races
dancing
and
drinking
whisky
and
this
latter
mode
of
spending
the
time
was
generally
most
agreeable
to
their
masters
a
slave
who
would
work
during
the
holidays
was
thought
by
his
master
undeserving
of
holidays
such
an
one
had
rejected
the
favor
of
his
master
there
was
in
this
simple
act
of
continued
work
an
accusation
against
slaves
and
a
slave
could
not
help
thinking
that
if
he
made
three
dollars
during
the
holidays
he
might
make
three
hundred
during
the
year
not
to
be
drunk
during
the
holidays
was
disgraceful
and
he
was
esteemed
a
lazy
and
improvident
man
who
could
not
afford
to
drink
whisky
during
christmas
the
fiddling
dancing
and
jubilee
was
going
on
in
all
directions
this
latter
performance
is
strictly
southern
it
supplies
the
place
of
a
violin
or
of
other
musical
instruments
and
is
played
so
easily
that
almost
every
farm
has
its
juba
beater
the
performer
improvises
as
he
beats
and
sings
his
merry
songs
so
ordering
the
words
as
to
have
them
fall
pat
with
the
movement
of
his
hands
among
a
mass
of
nonsense
and
wild
frolic
once
in
a
while
a
sharp
hit
is

meanness
of
slaveholders

poor

this
is
not
a
bad
summary
of
the
palpable
injustice
and
fraud
of
slavery
giving
as
it
does
to
the
lazy
and
idle
the
comforts
which
god
designed
should
be
given
solely
to
the
honest
laborer
but
to
the
holiday
s
judging
from
my
own
observation
and
experience
i
believe
these
holidays
to
be
among
the
most
effective
means
in
the
hands
of
slaveholders
of
keeping
down
the
spirit
of
insurrection
among
the
slaves
to
enslave
men
successfully
and
safely
it
is
necessary
to
have
their
minds
occupied
with
thoughts
and
aspirations
short
of
the
liberty
of
which
they
are
deprived
a
certain
degree
of
attainable
good
must
be
kept
before
them
these
holidays
serve
the
purpose
of
keeping
the
minds
of
the
slaves
occupied
with
prospective
pleasure
within
the
limits
of
slavery
the
young
man
can
go
wooing
the
married
man
can
visit
his
wife
the
father
and
mother
can
see
their
children
the
industrious
and
money
loving
can
make
a
few
dollars
the
great
wrestler
can
win
laurels
the
young
people
can
meet
and
enjoy
each
other
s
society
the
drunken
man
can
get
plenty
of
whisky
and
the
religious
man
can
hold
prayer
meetings
preach
pray
and
exhort
during
the
holidays
before
the
holidays
these
are
pleasures
in
prospect
after
the
holidays
they
become
pleasures
of
memory
and
they
serve
to
keep
out
thoughts
and
wishes
of
a
more
dangerous
character
were
slaveholders
at
once
to
abandon
the
practice
of
allowing
their
slaves
these
liberties
periodically
and
to
keep
them
the
year
round
closely
confined
to
the
narrow
circle
of
their
homes
i
doubt
not
that
the
south
would
blaze
with
insurrections
these
holidays
are
conductors
or
safety
valves
to
carry
off
the
explosive
elements
inseparable
from
the
human
mind
when
reduced
to
the
condition
of
slavery
but
for
these
the
rigors
of
bondage
would
become
too
severe
for
endurance
and
the
slave
would
be
forced
up
to
dangerous
desperation
woe
to
the
slaveholder
when
he
undertakes
to
hinder
or
to
prevent
the
operation
of
these
electric
conductors
a
succession
of
earthquakes
would
be
less
destructive
than
the
insurrectionary
fires
which
would
be
sure
to
burst
forth
in
different
parts
of
the
south
from
such
interference
thus
the
holidays
became
part
and
parcel
of
the
gross
fraud
wrongs
and
inhumanity
of
slavery
ostensibly
they
are
institutions
of
benevolence
designed
to
mitigate
the
rigors
of
slave
life
but
practically
they
are
a
fraud
instituted
by
human
selfishness
the
better
to
secure
the
ends
of
injustice
and
oppression
the
slave
s
happiness
is
not
the
end
sought
but
rather
the
master
s
safety
it
is
not
from
a
generous
unconcern
for
the
slave
s
labor
that
this
cessation
from
labor
is
allowed
but
from
a
prudent
regard
to
the
safety
of
the
slave
system
i
am
strengthened
in
this
opinion
by
the
fact
that
most
slaveholders
like
to
have
their
slaves
spend
the
holidays
in
such
a
manner
as
to
be
of
no
real
benefit
to
the
slaves
it
is
plain
that
everything
like
rational
enjoyment
among
the
slaves
is
frowned
upon
and
only
those
wild
and
low
sports
peculiar
to
people
are
encouraged
all
the
license
allowed
appears
to
have
no
other
object
than
to
disgust
the
slaves
with
their
temporary
freedom
and
to
make
them
as
glad
to
return
to
their
work
as
they
were
to
leave
it
by
plunging
them
into
exhausting
depths
of
drunkenness
and
dissipation
this
effect
is
almost
certain
to
follow
i
have
known
slaveholders
resort
to
cunning
tricks
with
a
view
of
getting
their
slaves
deplorably
drunk
a
usual
plan
is
to
make
bets
on
a
slave
that
he
can
drink
more
whisky
than
any
other
and
so
to
induce
a
rivalry
among
them
for
the
mastery
in
this
degradation
the
scenes
brought
about
in
this
way
were
often
scandalous
and
loathsome
in
the
extreme
whole
multitudes
might
be
found
stretched
out
in
brutal
drunkenness
at
once
helpless
and
disgusting
thus
when
the
slave
asks
for
a
few
hours
of
virtuous
freedom
his
cunning
master
takes
advantage
of
his
ignorance
and
cheers
him
with
a
dose
of
vicious
and
revolting
dissipation
artfully
labeled
with
the
name
of
liberty
we
were
induced
to
drink
i
among
the
rest
and
when
the
holidays
were
over
we
all
staggered
up
from
our
filth
and
wallowing
took
a
long
breath
and
went
away
to
our
various
fields
of
work
feeling
upon
the
whole
rather
glad
to
go
from
that
which
our
masters
artfully
deceived
us
into
the
belief
was
freedom
back
again
to
the
arms
of
slavery
it
was
not
what
we
had
taken
it
to
be
nor
what
it
might
have
been
had
it
not
been
abused
by
us
it
was
about
as
well
to
be
a
slave
to
as
to
be
a
slave
to
and
i
am
the
more
induced
to
take
this
view
of
the
holiday
system
adopted
by
slaveholders
from
what
i
know
of
their
treatment
of
slaves
in
regard
to
other
things
it
is
the
commonest
thing
for
them
to
try
to
disgust
their
slaves
with
what
they
do
not
want
them
to
have
or
to
enjoy
a
slave
for
instance
likes
molasses
he
steals
some
to
cure
him
of
the
taste
for
it
his
master
in
many
cases
will
go
away
to
town
and
buy
a
large
quantity
of
the
quality
and
set
it
before
his
slave
and
with
whip
in
hand
compel
him
to
eat
it
until
the
poor
fellow
is
made
to
sicken
at
the
very
thought
of
molasses
the
same
course
is
often
adopted
to
cure
slaves
of
the
disagreeable
and
inconvenient
practice
of
asking
for
more
food
when
their
allowance
has
failed
them
the
same
disgusting
process
works
well
too
in
other
things
but
i
need
not
cite
them
when
a
slave
is
drunk
the
slaveholder
has
no
fear
that
he
will
plan
an
insurrection
no
fear
that
he
will
escape
to
the
north
it
is
the
sober
thinking
slave
who
is
dangerous
and
needs
the
vigilance
of
his
master
to
keep
him
a
slave
but
to
proceed
with
my
narrative
on
the
first
of
january
i
proceeded
from
michael
s
to
william
freeland
s
my
new
home
freeland
lived
only
three
miles
from
michael
s
on
an
old
worn
out
farm
which
required
much
labor
to
restore
it
to
anything
like
a
establishment
i
was
not
long
in
finding
freeland
to
be
a
very
different
man
from
mr
covey
though
not
rich
freeland
was
what
may
be
called
a
southern
gentleman
as
different
from
covey
as
a
and
hardened
negro
breaker
is
from
the
best
specimen
of
the
first
families
of
the
south
though
freeland
was
a
slaveholder
and
shared
many
of
the
vices
of
his
class
he
seemed
alive
to
the
sentiment
of
honor
he
had
some
sense
of
justice
and
some
feelings
of
humanity
he
was
fretful
impulsive
and
passionate
but
i
must
do
him
the
justice
to
say
he
was
free
from
the
mean
and
selfish
characteristics
which
distinguished
the
creature
from
which
i
had
now
happily
escaped
he
was
open
frank
imperative
and
practiced
no
concealments
disdaining
to
play
the
spy
in
all
this
he
was
the
opposite
of
the
crafty
covey
among
the
many
advantages
gained
in
my
change
from
covey
s
to
freeland
s
startling
as
the
statement
may
be
was
the
fact
that
the
latter
gentleman
made
no
profession
of
religion
i
assert
that
the
religion
of
the
south
as
i
have
observed
it
and
proved
it
is
a
mere
covering
for
the
most
horrid
crimes
the
justifier
of
the
most
appalling
barbarity
a
sanctifier
of
the
most
hateful
frauds
and
a
secure
shelter
under
which
the
darkest
foulest
grossest
and
most
infernal
abominations
fester
and
flourish
were
i
again
to
be
reduced
to
the
condition
of
a
slave
to
that
calamity
i
should
regard
the
fact
of
being
the
slave
of
a
religious
slaveholder
the
greatest
that
could
befall
me
for
all
slaveholders
with
whom
i
have
ever
met
religious
slaveholders
are
the
worst
i
have
found
them
almost
invariably
the
vilest
meanest
and
basest
of
their
class
exceptions
there
may
be
but
this
is
true
of
religious
slaveholders
a
it
is
not
for
me
to
explain
the
fact
others
may
do
that
i
simply
state
it
as
a
fact
and
leave
the
theological
and
psychological
inquiry
which
it
raises
to
be
decided
by
others
more
competent
than
myself
religious
slaveholders
like
religious
persecutors
are
ever
extreme
in
their
malice
and
violence
very
near
my
new
home
on
an
adjoining
farm
there
lived
the
rev
daniel
weeden
who
was
both
pious
and
cruel
after
the
real
covey
pattern
weeden
was
a
local
preacher
of
the
protestant
methodist
persuasion
and
a
most
zealous
supporter
of
the
ordinances
of
religion
generally
this
weeden
owned
a
woman
called
ceal
who
was
a
standing
proof
of
his
mercilessness
poor
ceal
s
back
always
scantily
clothed
was
kept
literally
raw
by
the
lash
of
this
religious
man
and
gospel
minister
the
most
notoriously
wicked
man
so
called
in
distinction
from
church
members
could
hire
hands
more
easily
than
this
brute
when
sent
out
to
find
a
home
a
slave
would
never
enter
the
gates
of
the
preacher
weeden
while
a
sinful
sinner
needed
a
hand
be
have
ill
or
behave
well
it
was
the
known
maxim
of
weeden
that
it
is
the
duty
of
a
master
to
use
the
lash
if
for
no
other
reason
he
contended
that
this
was
essential
to
remind
a
slave
of
his
condition
and
of
his
master
s
authority
the
good
slave
must
be
whipped
to
be
good
and
the
bad
slave
must
be
whipped
to
be
good
such
was
weeden
s
theory
and
such
was
his
practice
the
back
of
his
will
in
the
judgment
be
the
swiftest
witness
against
him
while
i
am
stating
particular
cases
i
might
as
well
immortalize
another
of
my
neighbors
by
calling
him
by
name
and
putting
him
in
print
he
did
not
think
that
a
chiel
was
near
taking
notes
and
will
doubtless
feel
quite
angry
at
having
his
character
touched
off
in
the
ragged
style
of
a
slave
s
pen
i
beg
to
introduce
the
reader
to
rev
rigby
hopkins
hopkins
resides
between
easton
and
michael
s
in
talbot
county
maryland
the
severity
of
this
man
made
him
a
perfect
terror
to
the
slaves
of
his
neighborhood
the
peculiar
feature
of
his
government
was
his
system
of
whipping
slaves
as
he
said
of
deserving
it
he
always
managed
to
have
one
or
two
slaves
to
whip
on
monday
morning
so
as
to
start
his
hands
to
their
work
under
the
inspiration
of
a
new
assurance
on
monday
that
his
preaching
about
kindness
mercy
brotherly
love
and
the
like
on
sunday
did
not
interfere
with
or
prevent
him
from
establishing
his
authority
by
the
cowskin
he
seemed
to
wish
to
assure
them
that
his
tears
over
poor
lost
and
ruined
sinners
and
his
pity
for
them
did
not
reach
to
the
blacks
who
tilled
his
fields
this
saintly
hopkins
used
to
boast
that
he
was
the
best
hand
to
manage
a
negro
in
the
county
he
whipped
for
the
smallest
offenses
by
way
of
preventing
the
commission
of
large
ones
the
reader
might
imagine
a
difficulty
in
finding
faults
enough
for
such
frequent
whipping
but
this
is
because
you
have
no
idea
how
easy
a
matter
it
is
to
offend
a
man
who
is
on
the
for
offenses
the
man
unaccustomed
to
slaveholding
would
be
astonished
to
observe
how
many
offenses
there
are
in
the
slaveholder
s
catalogue
of
crimes
and
how
easy
it
is
to
commit
any
one
of
them
even
when
the
slave
least
intends
it
a
slaveholder
bent
on
finding
fault
will
hatch
up
a
dozen
a
day
if
he
chooses
to
do
so
and
each
one
of
these
shall
be
of
a
punishable
description
a
mere
look
word
or
motion
a
mistake
accident
or
want
of
power
are
all
matters
for
which
a
slave
may
be
whipped
at
any
time
does
a
slave
look
dissatisfied
with
his
condition
it
is
said
that
he
has
the
devil
in
him
and
it
must
be
whipped
out
does
he
answer
when
spoken
to
by
his
master
with
an
air
of
then
must
he
be
taken
down
a
lower
by
the
lash
well
laid
on
does
he
forget
and
omit
to
pull
off
his
hat
when
approaching
a
white
person
then
he
must
or
may
be
whipped
for
his
bad
manners
does
he
ever
venture
to
vindicate
his
conduct
when
harshly
and
unjustly
accused
then
he
is
guilty
of
impudence
one
of
the
greatest
crimes
in
the
social
catalogue
of
southern
society
to
allow
a
slave
to
escape
punishment
who
has
impudently
attempted
to
exculpate
himself
from
unjust
charges
preferred
against
him
by
some
white
person
is
to
be
guilty
of
great
dereliction
of
duty
does
a
slave
ever
venture
to
suggest
a
better
way
of
doing
a
thing
no
matter
what
he
is
altogether
too
officious
wise
above
what
is
written
and
he
deserves
even
if
he
does
not
get
a
flogging
for
his
presumption
does
he
while
plowing
break
a
plow
or
while
hoeing
break
a
hoe
or
while
chopping
break
an
ax
no
matter
what
were
the
imperfections
of
the
implement
broken
or
the
natural
liabilities
for
breaking
the
slave
can
be
whipped
for
carelessness
the
slaveholder
could
always
find
something
of
this
sort
to
justify
him
in
using
the
lash
several
times
during
the
week
hopkins
like
covey
and
weeden
were
shunned
by
slaves
who
had
the
privilege
as
many
had
of
finding
their
own
masters
at
the
end
of
each
year
and
yet
there
was
not
a
man
in
all
that
section
of
country
who
made
a
louder
profession
of
religion
than
did
rigby
hopkins
but
to
continue
the
thread
of
my
story
through
my
experience
when
at
william
freeland
s
my
poor
bark
now
reached
smoother
water
and
gentler
breezes
my
stormy
life
at
covey
s
had
been
of
service
to
me
the
things
that
would
have
seemed
very
hard
had
i
gone
direct
to
freeland
s
from
the
home
of
master
thomas
were
now
after
the
hardships
at
covey
s
trifles
light
as
i
was
still
a
field
hand
and
had
come
to
prefer
the
severe
labor
of
the
field
to
the
enervating
duties
of
a
house
servant
i
had
become
large
and
strong
and
had
begun
to
take
pride
in
the
fact
that
i
could
do
as
much
hard
work
as
some
of
the
older
men
there
is
much
rivalry
among
slaves
at
times
as
to
which
can
do
the
most
work
and
masters
generally
seek
to
promote
such
rivalry
but
some
of
us
were
too
wise
to
race
with
each
other
very
long
such
racing
we
had
the
sagacity
to
see
was
not
likely
to
pay
we
had
our
times
for
measuring
each
other
s
strength
but
we
knew
too
much
to
keep
up
the
competition
so
long
as
to
produce
an
extraordinary
day
s
work
we
knew
that
if
by
extraordinary
exertion
a
large
quantity
of
work
was
done
in
one
day
the
fact
becoming
known
to
the
master
might
lead
him
to
require
the
same
amount
every
day
this
thought
was
enough
to
bring
us
to
a
dead
halt
when
over
so
much
excited
for
the
race
at
freeland
s
my
condition
was
every
way
improved
i
was
no
longer
the
poor
that
i
was
when
at
covey
s
where
every
wrong
thing
done
was
saddled
upon
me
and
where
other
slaves
were
whipped
over
my
shoulders
freeland
was
too
just
a
man
thus
to
impose
upon
me
or
upon
any
one
else
it
is
quite
usual
to
make
one
slave
the
object
of
especial
abuse
and
to
beat
him
often
with
a
view
to
its
effect
upon
others
rather
than
with
any
expectation
that
the
slave
whipped
will
be
improved
by
it
but
the
man
with
whom
i
now
was
could
descend
to
no
such
meanness
and
wickedness
every
man
here
was
held
individually
responsible
for
his
own
conduct
this
was
a
vast
improvement
on
the
rule
at
covey
s
there
i
was
the
general
pack
horse
bill
smith
was
protected
by
a
positive
prohibition
made
by
his
rich
master
and
the
command
of
the
rich
slaveholder
is
law
to
the
poor
one
hughes
was
favored
because
of
his
relationship
to
covey
and
the
hands
hired
temporarily
escaped
flogging
except
as
they
got
it
over
my
poor
shoulders
of
course
this
comparison
refers
to
the
time
when
covey
whip
me
freeland
like
mr
covey
gave
his
hands
enough
to
eat
but
unlike
mr
covey
he
gave
them
time
to
take
their
meals
he
worked
us
hard
during
the
day
but
gave
us
the
night
for
rest
another
advantage
to
be
set
to
the
credit
of
the
sinner
as
against
that
of
the
saint
we
were
seldom
in
the
field
after
dark
in
the
evening
or
before
sunrise
in
the
morning
our
implements
of
husbandry
were
of
the
most
improved
pattern
and
much
superior
to
those
used
at
covey
s
nothwithstanding
the
improved
condition
which
was
now
mine
and
the
many
advantages
i
had
gained
by
my
new
home
and
my
new
master
i
was
still
restless
and
discontented
i
was
about
as
hard
to
please
by
a
master
as
a
master
is
by
slave
the
freedom
from
bodily
torture
and
unceasing
labor
had
given
my
mind
an
increased
sensibility
and
imparted
to
it
greater
activity
i
was
not
yet
exactly
in
right
relations
how
be
it
that
was
not
first
which
is
spiritual
but
that
which
is
natural
and
afterward
that
which
is
when
entombed
at
covey
s
shrouded
in
darkness
and
physical
wretchedness
temporal
wellbeing
was
the
grand
but
temporal
wants
supplied
the
spirit
puts
in
its
claims
beat
and
cuff
your
slave
keep
him
hungry
and
spiritless
and
he
will
follow
the
chain
of
his
master
like
a
dog
but
feed
and
clothe
him
well
work
him
moderately
surround
him
with
physical
comfort
and
dreams
of
freedom
intrude
give
him
a
master
and
he
aspires
to
a
master
give
him
a
good
master
and
he
wishes
to
become
his
master
such
is
human
nature
you
may
hurl
a
man
so
low
beneath
the
level
of
his
kind
that
he
loses
all
just
ideas
of
his
natural
position
but
elevate
him
a
little
and
the
clear
conception
of
rights
arises
to
life
and
power
and
leads
him
onward
thus
elevated
a
little
at
freeland
s
the
dreams
called
into
being
by
that
good
man
father
lawson
when
in
baltimore
began
to
visit
me
and
shoots
from
the
tree
of
liberty
began
to
put
forth
tender
buds
and
dim
hopes
of
the
future
began
to
dawn
i
found
myself
in
congenial
society
at
freeland
s
there
were
henry
harris
john
harris
handy
caldwell
and
sandy
jenkins
henry
and
john
were
brothers
and
belonged
to
freeland
they
were
both
remarkably
bright
and
intelligent
though
neither
of
them
could
read
now
for
mischief
i
had
not
been
long
at
freeland
s
before
i
was
up
to
my
old
tricks
i
early
began
to
address
my
companions
on
the
subject
of
education
and
the
advantages
of
intelligence
over
ignorance
and
as
far
as
i
dared
i
tried
to
show
the
agency
of
ignorance
in
keeping
men
in
slavery
webster
s
spelling
book
and
the
were
looked
into
again
as
summer
came
on
and
the
long
sabbath
days
stretched
themselves
over
our
idleness
i
became
uneasy
and
wanted
a
sabbath
school
in
which
to
exercise
my
gifts
and
to
impart
the
little
knowledge
of
letters
which
i
possessed
to
my
brother
slaves
a
house
was
hardly
necessary
in
the
summer
time
i
could
hold
my
school
under
the
shade
of
an
old
oak
tree
as
well
as
any
where
else
the
thing
was
to
get
the
scholars
and
to
have
them
thoroughly
imbued
with
the
desire
to
learn
two
such
boys
were
quickly
secured
in
henry
and
john
and
from
them
the
contagion
spread
i
was
not
long
bringing
around
me
twenty
or
thirty
young
men
who
enrolled
themselves
gladly
in
my
sabbath
school
and
were
willing
to
meet
me
regularly
under
the
trees
or
elsewhere
for
the
purpose
of
learning
to
read
it
was
surprising
with
what
ease
they
provided
themselves
with
spelling
books
these
were
mostly
the
cast
off
books
of
their
young
masters
or
mistresses
i
taught
at
first
on
our
own
farm
all
were
impressed
with
the
necessity
of
keeping
the
matter
as
private
as
possible
for
the
fate
of
the
michael
s
attempt
was
notorious
and
fresh
in
the
minds
of
all
our
pious
masters
at
michael
s
must
not
know
that
a
few
of
their
dusky
brothers
were
learning
to
read
the
word
of
god
lest
they
should
come
down
upon
us
with
the
lash
and
chain
we
might
have
met
to
drink
whisky
to
wrestle
fight
and
to
do
other
unseemly
things
with
no
fear
of
interruption
from
the
saints
or
sinners
of
michael
s
but
to
meet
for
the
purpose
of
improving
the
mind
and
heart
by
learning
to
read
the
sacred
scriptures
was
esteemed
a
most
dangerous
nuisance
to
be
instantly
stopped
the
slaveholders
of
michael
s
like
slaveholders
elsewhere
would
always
prefer
to
see
the
slaves
engaged
in
degrading
sports
rather
than
to
see
them
acting
like
moral
and
accountable
beings
had
any
one
asked
a
religious
white
man
in
michael
s
twenty
years
ago
the
names
of
three
men
in
that
town
whose
lives
were
most
after
the
pattern
of
our
lord
and
master
jesus
christ
the
first
three
would
have
been
as
follows
garrison
west
wright
fairbanks
thomas
auld
and
yet
these
were
men
who
ferociously
rushed
in
upon
my
sabbath
school
at
michael
s
armed
with
missiles
and
i
must
say
i
thought
him
a
christian
until
he
took
part
in
bloody
by
the
lash
this
same
garrison
west
was
my
class
leader
and
i
must
say
i
thought
him
a
christian
until
he
took
part
in
breaking
up
my
school
he
led
me
no
more
after
that
the
plea
for
this
outrage
was
then
as
it
is
now
and
at
all
times
the
danger
to
good
order
if
the
slaves
learnt
to
read
they
would
learn
something
else
and
something
worse
the
peace
of
slavery
would
be
disturbed
slave
rule
would
be
endangered
i
leave
the
reader
to
characterize
a
system
which
is
endangered
by
such
causes
i
do
not
dispute
the
soundness
of
the
reasoning
it
is
perfectly
sound
and
if
slavery
be
sabbath
schools
for
teaching
slaves
to
read
the
bible
are
and
ought
to
be
put
down
these
christian
class
leaders
were
to
this
extent
consistent
they
had
settled
the
question
that
slavery
is
and
by
that
standard
they
determined
that
sabbath
schools
are
wrong
to
be
sure
they
were
protestant
and
held
to
the
great
protestant
right
of
every
man
to
search
the
scriptures
for
himself
but
then
to
all
general
rules
there
are
how
convenient
what
crimes
may
not
be
committed
under
the
doctrine
of
the
last
remark
but
my
dear
class
leading
methodist
brethren
did
not
condescend
to
give
me
a
reason
for
breaking
up
the
sabbath
school
at
michael
s
it
was
enough
that
they
had
determined
upon
its
destruction
i
am
however
digressing
after
getting
the
school
cleverly
into
operation
the
second
time
holding
it
in
the
woods
behind
the
barn
and
in
the
shade
of
trees
i
succeeded
in
inducing
a
free
colored
man
who
lived
several
miles
from
our
house
to
permit
me
to
hold
my
school
in
a
room
at
his
house
he
very
kindly
gave
me
this
liberty
but
he
incurred
much
peril
in
doing
so
for
the
assemblage
was
an
unlawful
one
i
shall
not
mention
here
the
name
of
this
man
for
it
might
even
now
subject
him
to
persecution
although
the
offenses
were
committed
more
than
twenty
years
ago
i
had
at
one
time
more
than
forty
scholars
all
of
the
right
sort
and
many
of
them
succeeded
in
learning
to
read
i
have
met
several
slaves
from
maryland
who
were
once
my
scholars
and
who
obtained
their
freedom
i
doubt
not
partly
in
consequence
of
the
ideas
imparted
to
them
in
that
school
i
have
had
various
employments
during
my
short
life
but
i
look
back
to
with
more
satisfaction
than
to
that
afforded
by
my
sunday
school
an
attachment
deep
and
lasting
sprung
up
between
me
and
my
persecuted
pupils
which
made
parting
from
them
intensely
grievous
and
when
i
think
that
most
of
these
dear
souls
are
yet
shut
up
in
this
abject
thralldom
i
am
overwhelmed
with
grief
besides
my
sunday
school
i
devoted
three
evenings
a
week
to
my
fellow
slaves
during
the
winter
let
the
reader
reflect
upon
the
fact
that
in
this
christian
country
men
and
women
are
hiding
from
professors
of
religion
in
barns
in
the
woods
and
fields
in
order
to
learn
to
read
the
those
dear
souls
who
came
to
my
sabbath
school
came
because
it
was
popular
or
reputable
to
attend
such
a
place
for
they
came
under
the
liability
of
having
forty
stripes
laid
on
their
naked
backs
every
moment
they
spend
in
my
school
they
were
under
this
terrible
liability
and
in
this
respect
i
was
sharer
with
them
their
minds
had
been
cramped
and
starved
by
their
cruel
masters
the
light
of
education
had
been
completely
excluded
and
their
hard
earnings
had
been
taken
to
educate
their
master
s
children
i
felt
a
delight
in
circumventing
the
tyrants
and
in
blessing
the
victims
of
their
curses
the
year
at
freeland
s
passed
off
very
smoothly
to
outward
seeming
not
a
blow
was
given
me
during
the
whole
year
to
the
credit
of
freeland
irreligious
though
he
was
it
must
be
stated
that
he
was
the
best
master
i
ever
had
until
i
became
my
own
master
and
assumed
for
myself
as
i
had
a
right
to
do
the
responsibility
of
my
own
existence
and
the
exercise
of
my
own
powers
for
much
of
the
happiness
or
absence
of
misery
with
which
i
passed
this
year
with
freeland
i
am
indebted
to
the
genial
temper
and
ardent
friendship
of
my
brother
slaves
they
were
every
one
of
them
manly
generous
and
brave
yes
i
say
they
were
brave
and
i
will
add
fine
looking
it
is
seldom
the
lot
of
mortals
to
have
truer
and
better
friends
than
were
the
slaves
on
this
farm
it
is
not
uncommon
to
charge
slaves
with
great
treachery
toward
each
other
and
to
believe
them
incapable
of
confiding
in
each
other
but
i
must
say
that
i
never
loved
esteemed
or
confided
in
men
more
than
i
did
in
these
they
were
as
true
as
steel
and
no
band
of
brothers
could
have
been
more
loving
there
were
no
mean
advantages
taken
of
each
other
as
is
sometimes
the
case
where
slaves
are
situated
as
we
were
no
tattling
no
giving
each
other
bad
names
to
freeland
and
no
elevating
one
at
the
expense
of
the
other
we
never
undertook
to
do
any
thing
of
any
importance
which
was
likely
to
affect
each
other
without
mutual
consultation
we
were
generally
a
unit
and
moved
together
thoughts
and
sentiments
were
exchanged
between
us
which
might
well
be
called
very
incendiary
by
oppressors
and
tyrants
and
perhaps
the
time
has
not
even
now
come
when
it
is
safe
to
unfold
all
the
flying
suggestions
which
arise
in
the
minds
of
intelligent
slaves
several
of
my
friends
and
brothers
if
yet
alive
are
still
in
some
part
of
the
house
of
bondage
and
though
twenty
years
have
passed
away
the
suspicious
malice
of
slavery
might
punish
them
for
even
listening
to
my
thoughts
the
slaveholder
kind
or
cruel
is
a
slaveholder
still
the
every
hour
violator
of
the
just
and
inalienable
rights
of
man
and
he
is
therefore
every
hour
silently
whetting
the
knife
of
vengeance
for
his
own
throat
he
never
lisps
a
syllable
in
commendation
of
the
fathers
of
this
republic
nor
denounces
any
attempted
oppression
of
himself
without
inviting
the
knife
to
his
own
throat
and
asserting
the
rights
of
rebellion
for
his
own
slaves
the
year
is
ended
and
we
are
now

future
i
too
was
thus
exercised
i
had
little
pleasure
in
retrospect
and
the
prospect
was
not
very
brilliant
notwithstanding
thought
i
the
many
resolutions
and
prayers
i
have
made
in
behalf
of
freedom
i
am
this
first
day
of
the
year
still
a
slave
still
wandering
in
the
depths
of
thralldom
my
faculties
and
powers
of
body
and
soul
are
not
my
own
but
are
the
property
of
a
fellow
mortal
in
no
sense
superior
to
me
except
that
he
has
the
physical
power
to
compel
me
to
be
owned
and
controlled
by
him
by
the
combined
physical
force
of
the
community
i
am
his
slave
a
slave
for
with
thoughts
like
these
i
was
perplexed
and
chafed
they
rendered
me
gloomy
and
disconsolate
the
anguish
of
my
mind
may
not
be
written
at
the
close
of
the
year
freeland
my
temporary
master
had
bought
me
of
capt
thomas
auld
for
the
year
his
promptness
in
securing
my
services
would
have
been
flattering
to
my
vanity
had
i
been
ambitious
to
win
the
reputation
of
being
a
valuable
slave
even
as
it
was
i
felt
a
slight
degree
of
complacency
at
the
circumstance
it
showed
he
was
as
well
pleased
with
me
as
a
slave
as
i
was
with
him
as
a
master
i
have
already
intimated
my
regard
for
freeland
and
i
may
say
here
in
addressing
northern
readers
where
is
no
selfish
motive
for
speaking
in
praise
of
a
slaveholder
that
freeland
was
a
man
of
many
excellent
qualities
and
to
me
quite
preferable
to
any
master
i
ever
had
but
the
kindness
of
the
slavemaster
only
gilds
the
chain
of
slavery
and
detracts
nothing
from
its
weight
or
power
the
thought
that
men
are
made
for
other
and
better
uses
than
slavery
thrives
best
under
the
gentle
treatment
of
a
kind
master
but
the
grim
visage
of
slavery
can
assume
no
smiles
which
can
fascinate
the
partially
enlightened
slave
into
a
forgetfulness
of
his
bondage
nor
of
the
desirableness
of
liberty
i
was
not
through
the
first
month
of
this
my
second
year
with
the
kind
and
gentlemanly
freeland
before
i
was
earnestly
considering
and
advising
plans
for
gaining
that
freedom
which
when
i
was
but
a
mere
child
i
had
ascertained
to
be
the
natural
and
inborn
right
of
every
member
of
the
human
family
the
desire
for
this
freedom
had
been
benumbed
while
i
was
under
the
brutalizing
dominion
of
covey
and
it
had
been
postponed
and
rendered
inoperative
by
my
truly
pleasant
sunday
school
engagements
with
my
friends
during
the
year
at
freeland
s
it
had
however
never
entirely
subsided
i
hated
slavery
always
and
the
desire
for
freedom
only
needed
a
favorable
breeze
to
fan
it
into
a
blaze
at
any
moment
the
thought
of
only
being
a
creature
of
the
and
the
troubled
me
and
i
longed
to
have
a
a
future
with
hope
in
it
to
be
shut
up
entirely
to
the
past
and
present
is
abhorrent
to
the
human
mind
it
is
to
the
soul
whose
life
and
happiness
is
unceasing
progress
what
the
prison
is
to
the
body
a
blight
and
mildew
a
hell
of
horrors
the
dawning
of
this
another
year
awakened
me
from
my
temporary
slumber
and
roused
into
life
my
latent
but
long
cherished
aspirations
for
freedom
i
was
now
not
only
ashamed
to
be
contented
in
slavery
but
ashamed
to
to
be
contented
and
in
my
present
favorable
condition
under
the
mild
rule
of
i
am
not
sure
that
some
kind
reader
will
not
condemn
me
for
being
over
ambitious
and
greatly
wanting
in
proper
humility
when
i
say
the
truth
that
i
now
drove
from
me
all
thoughts
of
making
the
best
of
my
lot
and
welcomed
only
such
thoughts
as
led
me
away
from
the
house
of
bondage
the
intense
desires
now
felt
be
quickened
by
my
present
favorable
circumstances
brought
me
to
the
determination
to
act
as
well
as
to
think
and
speak
accordingly
at
the
beginning
of
this
year
i
took
upon
me
a
solemn
vow
that
the
year
which
had
now
dawned
upon
me
should
not
close
without
witnessing
an
earnest
attempt
on
my
part
to
gain
my
liberty
this
vow
only
bound
me
to
make
my
escape
individually
but
the
year
spent
with
freeland
had
attached
me
as
with
hooks
of
steel
to
my
brother
slaves
the
most
affectionate
and
confiding
friendship
existed
between
us
and
i
felt
it
my
duty
to
give
them
an
opportunity
to
share
in
my
virtuous
determination
by
frankly
disclosing
to
them
my
plans
and
purposes
toward
henry
and
john
harris
i
felt
a
friendship
as
strong
as
one
man
can
feel
for
another
for
i
could
have
died
with
and
for
them
to
them
therefore
with
a
suitable
degree
of
caution
i
began
to
disclose
my
sentiments
and
plans
sounding
them
the
while
on
the
subject
of
running
away
provided
a
good
chance
should
offer
i
scarcely
need
tell
the
reader
that
i
did
my
to
imbue
the
minds
of
my
dear
friends
with
my
own
views
and
feelings
thoroughly
awakened
now
and
with
a
definite
vow
upon
me
all
my
little
reading
which
had
any
bearing
on
the
subject
of
human
rights
was
rendered
available
in
my
communications
with
my
friends
that
to
me
gem
of
a
book
the
with
its
eloquent
orations
and
spicy
dialogues
denouncing
oppression
and
slavery
telling
of
what
had
been
dared
done
and
suffered
by
men
to
obtain
the
inestimable
boon
of
liberty
was
still
fresh
in
my
memory
and
whirled
into
the
ranks
of
my
speech
with
the
aptitude
of
well
trained
soldiers
going
through
the
drill
the
fact
is
i
here
began
my
public
speaking
i
canvassed
with
henry
and
john
the
subject
of
slavery
and
dashed
against
it
the
condemning
brand
of
god
s
eternal
justice
which
it
every
hour
violates
my
fellow
servants
were
neither
indifferent
dull
nor
inapt
our
feelings
were
more
alike
than
our
opinions
all
however
were
ready
to
act
when
a
feasible
plan
should
be
proposed
show
us
the
thing
is
to
be
done
said
they
and
all
is
we
were
all
except
sandy
quite
free
from
slaveholding
priestcraft
it
was
in
vain
that
we
had
been
taught
from
the
pulpit
at
michael
s
the
duty
of
obedience
to
our
masters
to
recognize
god
as
the
author
of
our
enslavement
to
regard
running
away
an
offense
alike
against
god
and
man
to
deem
our
enslavement
a
merciful
and
beneficial
arrangement
to
esteem
our
condition
in
this
country
a
paradise
to
that
from
which
we
had
been
snatched
in
africa
to
consider
our
hard
hands
and
dark
color
as
god
s
mark
of
displeasure
and
as
pointing
us
out
as
the
proper
subjects
of
slavery
that
the
relation
of
master
and
slave
was
one
of
reciprocal
benefits
that
our
work
was
not
more
serviceable
to
our
masters
than
our
master
s
thinking
was
serviceable
to
us
i
say
it
was
in
vain
that
the
pulpit
of
michael
s
had
constantly
inculcated
these
plausible
doctrine
nature
laughed
them
to
scorn
for
my
own
part
i
had
now
become
altogether
too
big
for
my
chains
father
lawson
s
solemn
words
of
what
i
ought
to
be
and
might
be
in
the
providence
of
god
had
not
fallen
dead
on
my
soul
i
was
fast
verging
toward
manhood
and
the
prophecies
of
my
childhood
were
still
unfulfilled
the
thought
that
year
after
year
had
passed
away
and
my
resolutions
to
run
away
had
failed
and
faded
that
i
was
a
and
a
slave
too
with
chances
for
gaining
my
freedom
diminished
and
still
diminishing
was
not
a
matter
to
be
slept
over
easily
nor
did
i
easily
sleep
over
it
but
here
came
a
new
trouble
thoughts
and
purposes
so
incendiary
as
those
i
now
cherished
could
not
agitate
the
mind
long
without
danger
of
making
themselves
manifest
to
scrutinizing
and
unfriendly
beholders
i
had
reason
to
fear
that
my
sable
face
might
prove
altogether
too
transparent
for
the
safe
concealment
of
my
hazardous
enterprise
plans
of
greater
moment
have
leaked
through
stone
walls
and
revealed
their
projectors
but
here
was
no
stone
wall
to
hide
my
purpose
i
would
have
given
my
poor
tell
tale
face
for
the
immoveable
countenance
of
an
indian
for
it
was
far
from
being
proof
against
the
daily
searching
glances
of
those
with
whom
i
met
it
is
the
interest
and
business
of
slaveholders
to
study
human
nature
with
a
view
to
practical
results
and
many
of
them
attain
astonishing
proficiency
in
discerning
the
thoughts
and
emotions
of
slaves
they
have
to
deal
not
with
earth
wood
or
stone
but
with
and
by
every
regard
they
have
for
their
safety
and
prosperity
they
must
study
to
know
the
material
on
which
they
are
at
work
so
much
intellect
as
the
slaveholder
has
around
him
requires
watching
their
safety
depends
upon
their
vigilance
conscious
of
the
injustice
and
wrong
they
are
every
hour
perpetrating
and
knowing
what
they
themselves
would
do
if
made
the
victims
of
such
wrongs
they
are
looking
out
for
the
first
signs
of
the
dread
retribution
of
justice
they
watch
therefore
with
skilled
and
practiced
eyes
and
have
learned
to
read
with
great
accuracy
the
state
of
mind
and
heart
of
the
slaves
through
his
sable
face
these
uneasy
sinners
are
quick
to
inquire
into
the
matter
where
the
slave
is
concerned
unusual
sobriety
apparent
abstraction
sullenness
and
indifference
indeed
any
mood
out
of
the
common
way
afford
ground
for
suspicion
and
inquiry
often
relying
on
their
superior
position
and
wisdom
they
hector
and
torture
the
slave
into
a
confession
by
affecting
to
know
the
truth
of
their
accusations
you
have
got
the
devil
in
you
say
they
and
we
will
whip
him
out
of
i
have
often
been
put
thus
to
the
torture
on
bare
suspicion
this
system
has
its
disadvantages
as
well
as
their
opposite
the
slave
is
sometimes
whipped
into
the
confession
of
offenses
which
he
never
committed
the
reader
will
see
that
the
good
old
rule
a
man
is
to
be
held
innocent
until
proved
to
be
guilty
does
not
hold
good
on
the
slave
plantation
suspicion
and
torture
are
the
approved
methods
of
getting
at
the
truth
here
it
was
necessary
for
me
therefore
to
keep
a
watch
over
my
deportment
lest
the
enemy
should
get
the
better
of
me
but
with
all
our
caution
and
studied
reserve
i
am
not
sure
that
freeland
did
not
suspect
that
all
was
not
right
with
us
it
seem
that
he
watched
us
more
narrowly
after
the
plan
of
escape
had
been
conceived
and
discussed
amongst
us
men
seldom
see
themselves
as
others
see
them
and
while
to
ourselves
everything
connected
with
our
contemplated
escape
appeared
concealed
freeland
may
have
with
the
peculiar
prescience
of
a
slaveholder
mastered
the
huge
thought
which
was
disturbing
our
peace
in
slavery
i
am
the
more
inclined
to
think
that
he
suspected
us
because
prudent
as
we
were
as
i
now
look
back
i
can
see
that
we
did
many
silly
things
very
well
calculated
to
awaken
suspicion
we
were
at
times
remarkably
buoyant
singing
hymns
and
making
joyous
exclamations
almost
as
triumphant
in
their
tone
as
if
we
reached
a
land
of
freedom
and
safety
a
keen
observer
might
have
detected
in
our
repeated
singing
of
canaan
sweet
canaan
i
am
bound
for
the
land
of
canaan
something
more
than
a
hope
of
reaching
heaven
we
meant
to
reach
the
and
the
north
was
our
canaan
thought
i
heard
them
say
there
were
lions
in
the
way
i
don
t
expect
to
star
much
longer
to
jesus
shun
the
danger
i
don
t
expect
to
stay
much
longer
was
a
favorite
air
and
had
a
double
meaning
in
the
lips
of
some
it
meant
the
expectation
of
a
speedy
summons
to
a
world
of
spirits
but
in
the
lips
of
company
it
simply
meant
a
speedy
pilgrimage
toward
a
free
state
and
deliverance
from
all
the
evils
and
dangers
of
slavery
i
had
succeeded
in
winning
to
my
what
slaveholders
would
call
wicked
scheme
a
company
of
five
young
men
the
very
flower
of
the
neighborhood
each
one
of
whom
would
have
commanded
one
thousand
dollars
in
the
home
market
at
new
orleans
they
would
have
brought
fifteen
hundred
dollars
a
piece
and
perhaps
more
the
names
of
our
party
were
as
follows
henry
harris
john
harris
brother
to
henry
sandy
jenkins
of
root
memory
charles
roberts
and
henry
bailey
i
was
the
youngest
but
one
of
the
party
i
had
however
the
advantage
of
them
all
in
experience
and
in
a
knowledge
of
letters
this
gave
me
great
influence
over
them
perhaps
not
one
of
them
left
to
himself
would
have
dreamed
of
escape
as
a
possible
thing
not
one
of
them
was
in
the
matter
they
all
wanted
to
be
free
but
the
serious
thought
of
running
away
had
not
entered
into
their
minds
until
i
won
them
to
the
undertaking
they
all
were
tolerably
well
off
for
slaves
and
had
dim
hopes
of
being
set
free
some
day
by
their
masters
if
any
one
is
to
blame
for
disturbing
the
quiet
of
the
slaves
and
of
the
neighborhood
of
michael
s
am
the
i
claim
to
be
the
instigator
of
the
high
crime
as
the
slaveholders
regard
it
and
i
kept
life
in
it
until
life
could
be
kept
in
it
no
longer
pending
the
time
of
our
contemplated
departure
out
of
our
egypt
we
met
often
by
night
and
on
every
sunday
at
these
meetings
we
talked
the
matter
over
told
our
hopes
and
fears
and
the
difficulties
discovered
or
imagined
and
like
men
of
sense
we
counted
the
cost
of
the
enterprise
to
which
we
were
committing
ourselves
these
meetings
must
have
resembled
on
a
small
scale
the
meetings
of
revolutionary
conspirators
in
their
primary
condition
we
were
plotting
against
our
so
called
lawful
rulers
with
this
difference
that
we
sought
our
own
good
and
not
the
harm
of
our
enemies
we
did
not
seek
to
overthrow
them
but
to
escape
from
them
as
for
freeland
we
all
liked
him
and
would
have
gladly
remained
with
him
liberty
was
our
aim
and
we
had
now
come
to
think
that
we
had
a
right
to
liberty
against
every
obstacle
even
against
the
lives
of
our
enslavers
we
had
several
words
expressive
of
things
important
to
us
which
we
understood
but
which
even
if
distinctly
heard
by
an
outsider
would
convey
no
certain
meaning
i
have
reasons
for
suppressing
these
which
the
reader
will
easily
divine
i
hated
the
secrecy
but
where
slavery
is
powerful
and
liberty
is
weak
the
latter
is
driven
to
concealment
or
to
destruction
the
prospect
was
not
always
a
bright
one
at
times
we
were
almost
tempted
to
abandon
the
enterprise
and
to
get
back
to
that
comparative
peace
of
mind
which
even
a
man
under
the
gallows
might
feel
when
all
hope
of
escape
had
vanished
quiet
bondage
was
felt
to
be
better
than
the
doubts
fears
and
uncertainties
which
now
so
sadly
perplexed
and
disturbed
us
the
infirmities
of
humanity
generally
were
represented
in
our
little
band
we
were
confident
bold
and
determined
at
times
and
again
doubting
timid
and
wavering
whistling
like
the
boy
in
the
graveyard
to
keep
away
the
spirits
to
look
at
the
map
and
observe
the
proximity
of
eastern
shore
maryland
to
delaware
and
pennsylvania
it
may
seem
to
the
reader
quite
absurd
to
regard
the
proposed
escape
as
a
formidable
undertaking
but
to
some
one
has
said
a
man
must
the
real
distance
was
great
enough
but
the
imagined
distance
was
to
our
ignorance
even
greater
every
slaveholder
seeks
to
impress
his
slave
with
a
belief
in
the
boundlessness
of
slave
territory
and
of
his
own
almost
illimitable
power
we
all
had
vague
and
indistinct
notions
of
the
geography
of
the
country
the
distance
however
is
not
the
chief
trouble
the
nearer
are
the
lines
of
a
slave
state
and
the
borders
of
a
free
one
the
greater
the
peril
hired
kidnappers
infest
these
borders
then
too
we
knew
that
merely
reaching
a
free
state
did
not
free
us
that
wherever
caught
we
could
be
returned
to
slavery
we
could
see
no
spot
on
this
side
the
ocean
where
we
could
be
free
we
had
heard
of
canada
the
real
canaan
of
the
american
bondmen
simply
as
a
country
to
which
the
wild
goose
and
the
swan
repaired
at
the
end
of
winter
to
escape
the
heat
of
summer
but
not
as
the
home
of
man
i
knew
something
of
theology
but
nothing
of
geography
i
really
did
not
at
that
time
know
that
there
was
a
state
of
new
york
or
a
state
of
massachusetts
i
had
heard
of
pennsylvania
delaware
and
new
jersey
and
all
the
southern
states
but
was
ignorant
of
the
free
states
generally
new
york
city
was
our
northern
limit
and
to
go
there
and
be
forever
harassed
with
the
liability
of
being
hunted
down
and
returned
to
slavery
with
the
certainty
of
being
treated
ten
times
worse
than
we
had
ever
been
treated
before
was
a
prospect
far
from
delightful
and
it
might
well
cause
some
hesitation
about
engaging
in
the
enterprise
the
case
sometimes
to
our
excited
visions
stood
thus
at
every
gate
through
which
we
had
to
pass
we
saw
a
watchman
at
every
ferry
a
guard
on
every
bridge
a
sentinel
and
in
every
wood
a
patrol
or
we
were
hemmed
in
on
every
side
the
good
to
be
sought
and
the
evil
to
be
shunned
were
flung
in
the
balance
and
weighed
against
each
other
on
the
one
hand
there
stood
slavery
a
stern
reality
glaring
frightfully
upon
us
with
the
blood
of
millions
in
his
polluted
skirts
terrible
to
behold
greedily
devouring
our
hard
earnings
and
feeding
himself
upon
our
flesh
here
was
the
evil
from
which
to
escape
on
the
other
hand
far
away
back
in
the
hazy
distance
where
all
forms
seemed
but
shadows
under
the
flickering
light
of
the
north
star
behind
some
craggy
hill
or
mountain
stood
a
doubtful
freedom
half
frozen
beckoning
us
to
her
icy
domain
this
was
the
good
to
be
sought
the
inequality
was
as
great
as
that
between
certainty
and
uncertainty
this
in
itself
was
enough
to
stagger
us
but
when
we
came
to
survey
the
untrodden
road
and
conjecture
the
many
possible
difficulties
we
were
appalled
and
at
times
as
i
have
said
were
upon
the
point
of
giving
over
the
struggle
altogether
the
reader
can
have
little
idea
of
the
phantoms
of
trouble
which
flit
in
such
circumstances
before
the
uneducated
mind
of
the
slave
upon
either
side
we
saw
grim
death
assuming
a
variety
of
horrid
shapes
now
it
was
starvation
causing
us
in
a
strange
and
friendless
land
to
eat
our
own
flesh
now
we
were
contending
with
the
waves
for
our
journey
was
in
part
by
water
and
were
drowned
now
we
were
hunted
by
dogs
and
overtaken
and
torn
to
pieces
by
their
merciless
fangs
we
were
stung
by
scorpions
chased
by
wild
beasts
bitten
by
snakes
and
worst
of
all
after
having
succeeded
in
swimming
rivers
encountering
wild
beasts
sleeping
in
the
woods
suffering
hunger
cold
heat
and
nakedness
we
supposed
ourselves
to
be
overtaken
by
hired
kidnappers
who
in
the
name
of
the
law
and
for
their
thrice
accursed
reward
would
perchance
fire
upon
us
kill
some
wound
others
and
capture
all
this
dark
picture
drawn
by
ignorance
and
fear
at
times
greatly
shook
our
determination
and
not
unfrequently
caused
us
to
bear
those
ills
we
had
than
fly
to
others
which
we
knew
not
i
am
not
disposed
to
magnify
this
circumstance
in
my
experience
and
yet
i
think
i
shall
seem
to
be
so
disposed
to
the
reader
no
man
can
tell
the
intense
agony
which
is
felt
by
the
slave
when
wavering
on
the
point
of
making
his
escape
all
that
he
has
is
at
stake
and
even
that
which
he
has
not
is
at
stake
also
the
life
which
he
has
may
be
lost
and
the
liberty
which
he
seeks
may
not
be
gained
patrick
henry
to
a
listening
senate
thrilled
by
his
magic
eloquence
and
ready
to
stand
by
him
in
his
boldest
flights
could
say
give
me
liberty
or
give
me
death
and
this
saying
was
a
sublime
one
even
for
a
freeman
but
incomparably
more
sublime
is
the
same
sentiment
when
asserted
by
men
accustomed
to
the
lash
and
chain
men
whose
sensibilities
must
have
become
more
or
less
deadened
by
their
bondage
with
us
it
was
a
liberty
at
best
that
we
sought
and
a
certain
lingering
death
in
the
rice
swamps
and
sugar
fields
if
we
failed
life
is
not
lightly
regarded
by
men
of
sane
minds
it
is
precious
alike
to
the
pauper
and
to
the
prince
to
the
slave
and
to
his
master
and
yet
i
believe
there
was
not
one
among
us
who
would
not
rather
have
been
shot
down
than
pass
away
life
in
hopeless
bondage
in
the
progress
of
our
preparations
sandy
the
root
man
became
troubled
he
began
to
have
dreams
and
some
of
them
were
very
distressing
one
of
these
which
happened
on
a
friday
night
was
to
him
of
great
significance
and
i
am
quite
ready
to
confess
that
i
felt
somewhat
damped
by
it
myself
he
said
i
dreamed
last
night
that
i
was
roused
from
sleep
by
strange
noises
like
the
voices
of
a
swarm
of
angry
birds
that
caused
a
roar
as
they
passed
which
fell
upon
my
ear
like
a
coming
gale
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
looking
up
to
see
what
it
could
mean
said
sandy
i
saw
you
frederick
in
the
claws
of
a
huge
bird
surrounded
by
a
large
number
of
birds
of
all
colors
and
sizes
these
were
all
picking
at
you
while
you
with
your
arms
seemed
to
be
trying
to
protect
your
eyes
passing
over
me
the
birds
flew
in
a
direction
and
i
watched
them
until
they
were
clean
out
of
sight
now
i
saw
this
as
plainly
as
i
now
see
you
and
furder
honey
watch
de
friday
night
dream
dare
is
sumpon
in
it
shose
you
born
dare
is
indeed
i
confess
i
did
not
like
this
dream
but
i
threw
off
concern
about
it
by
attributing
it
to
the
general
excitement
and
perturbation
consequent
upon
our
contemplated
plan
of
escape
i
could
not
however
shake
off
its
effect
at
once
i
felt
that
it
boded
me
no
good
sandy
was
unusually
emphatic
and
oracular
and
his
manner
had
much
to
do
with
the
impression
made
upon
me
the
plan
of
escape
which
i
recommended
and
to
which
my
comrades
assented
was
to
take
a
large
canoe
owned
by
hamilton
and
on
the
saturday
night
previous
to
the
easter
holidays
launch
out
into
the
chesapeake
bay
and
paddle
for
its
head
a
distance
of
seventy
miles
with
all
our
might
our
course
on
reaching
this
point
was
to
turn
the
canoe
adrift
and
bend
our
steps
toward
the
north
star
till
we
reached
a
free
state
there
were
several
objections
to
this
plan
one
was
the
danger
from
gales
on
the
bay
in
rough
weather
the
waters
of
the
chesapeake
are
much
agitated
and
there
is
danger
in
a
canoe
of
being
swamped
by
the
waves
another
objection
was
that
the
canoe
would
soon
be
missed
the
absent
persons
would
at
once
be
suspected
of
having
taken
it
and
we
should
be
pursued
by
some
of
the
fast
sailing
bay
craft
out
of
michael
s
then
again
if
we
reached
the
head
of
the
bay
and
turned
the
canoe
adrift
she
might
prove
a
guide
to
our
track
and
bring
the
land
hunters
after
us
these
and
other
objections
were
set
aside
by
the
stronger
ones
which
could
be
urged
against
every
other
plan
that
could
then
be
passes
written
suggested
on
the
water
we
had
a
chance
of
being
regarded
as
fishermen
in
the
service
of
a
master
on
the
other
hand
by
taking
the
land
route
through
the
counties
adjoining
delaware
we
should
be
subjected
to
all
manner
of
interruptions
and
many
very
disagreeable
questions
which
might
give
us
serious
trouble
any
white
man
is
authorized
to
stop
a
man
of
color
on
any
road
and
examine
him
and
arrest
him
if
he
so
desires
by
this
arrangement
many
abuses
considered
such
even
by
slaveholders
occur
cases
have
been
known
where
freemen
have
been
called
upon
to
show
their
free
papers
by
a
pack
of
ruffians
and
on
the
presentation
of
the
papers
the
ruffians
have
torn
them
up
and
seized
their
victim
and
sold
him
to
a
life
of
endless
bondage
the
week
before
our
intended
start
i
wrote
a
pass
for
each
of
our
party
giving
them
permission
to
visit
baltimore
during
the
easter
holidays
the
pass
ran
after
this
manner
this
is
to
certify
that
i
the
undersigned
have
given
the
bearer
my
servant
john
full
liberty
to
go
to
baltimore
to
spend
the
easter
holidays
near
michael
s
talbot
county
maryland
although
we
were
not
going
to
baltimore
and
were
intending
to
land
east
of
north
point
in
the
direction
where
i
had
seen
the
philadelphia
steamers
go
these
passes
might
be
made
useful
to
us
in
the
lower
part
of
the
bay
while
steering
toward
baltimore
these
were
not
however
to
be
shown
by
us
until
all
other
answers
failed
to
satisfy
the
inquirer
we
were
all
fully
alive
to
the
importance
of
being
calm
and
when
accosted
if
accosted
we
should
be
and
we
more
times
than
one
rehearsed
to
each
other
how
we
should
behave
in
the
hour
of
trial
these
were
long
tedious
days
and
nights
the
suspense
was
painful
in
the
extreme
to
balance
probabilities
where
life
and
liberty
hang
on
the
result
requires
steady
nerves
i
panted
for
action
and
was
glad
when
the
day
at
the
close
of
which
we
were
to
start
dawned
upon
us
sleeping
the
night
before
was
out
of
the
question
i
probably
felt
more
deeply
than
any
of
my
companions
because
i
was
the
instigator
of
the
movement
the
responsibility
of
the
whole
enterprise
rested
on
my
shoulders
the
glory
of
success
and
the
shame
and
confusion
of
failure
could
not
be
matters
of
indifference
to
me
our
food
was
prepared
our
clothes
were
packed
up
we
were
all
ready
to
go
and
impatient
for
saturday
morning
considering
that
the
last
morning
of
our
bondage
i
can
not
describe
the
tempest
and
tumult
of
my
brain
that
morning
the
reader
will
please
to
bear
in
mind
that
in
a
slave
state
an
unsuccessful
runaway
is
not
only
subjected
to
cruel
torture
and
sold
away
to
the
far
south
but
he
is
frequently
execrated
by
the
other
slaves
he
is
charged
with
making
the
condition
of
the
other
slaves
intolerable
by
laying
them
all
under
the
suspicion
of
their
masters
subjecting
them
to
greater
vigilance
and
imposing
greater
limitations
on
their
privileges
i
dreaded
murmurs
from
this
quarter
it
is
difficult
too
for
a
slavemaster
to
believe
that
slaves
escaping
have
not
been
aided
in
their
flight
by
some
one
of
their
fellow
slaves
when
therefore
a
slave
is
missing
every
slave
on
the
place
is
closely
examined
as
to
his
knowledge
of
the
undertaking
and
they
are
sometimes
even
tortured
to
make
them
disclose
what
they
are
suspected
of
knowing
of
such
escape
our
anxiety
grew
more
and
more
intense
as
the
time
of
our
intended
departure
for
the
north
drew
nigh
it
was
truly
felt
to
be
a
matter
of
life
and
death
with
us
and
we
fully
intended
to
as
well
as
if
necessity
should
occur
for
that
extremity
but
the
trial
hour
was
not
yet
to
come
it
was
easy
to
resolve
but
not
so
easy
to
act
i
expected
there
might
be
some
drawing
back
at
the
last
it
was
natural
that
there
should
be
therefore
during
the
intervening
time
i
lost
no
opportunity
to
explain
away
difficulties
to
remove
doubts
to
dispel
fears
and
to
inspire
all
with
firmness
it
was
too
late
to
look
back
and
was
the
time
to
go
forward
like
most
other
men
we
had
done
the
talking
part
of
our
work
long
and
well
and
the
time
had
come
to
as
if
we
were
in
earnest
and
meant
to
be
as
true
in
action
as
in
words
i
did
not
forget
to
appeal
to
the
pride
of
my
comrades
by
telling
them
that
if
after
having
solemnly
promised
to
go
as
they
had
done
they
now
failed
to
make
the
attempt
they
would
in
effect
brand
themselves
with
cowardice
and
might
as
well
sit
down
fold
their
arms
and
acknowledge
themselves
as
fit
only
to
be
this
detestable
character
all
were
unwilling
to
assume
every
man
except
sandy
he
much
to
our
regret
withdrew
stood
firm
and
at
our
last
meeting
we
pledged
ourselves
afresh
and
in
the
most
solemn
manner
that
at
the
time
appointed
we
certainly
start
on
our
long
journey
for
a
free
country
this
meeting
was
in
the
middle
of
the
week
at
the
end
of
which
we
were
to
start
early
that
morning
we
went
as
usual
to
the
field
but
with
hearts
that
beat
quickly
and
anxiously
any
one
intimately
acquainted
with
us
might
have
seen
that
all
was
not
well
with
us
and
that
some
monster
lingered
in
our
thoughts
our
work
that
morning
was
the
same
as
it
had
been
for
several
days
past
drawing
out
and
spreading
manure
while
thus
engaged
i
had
a
sudden
presentiment
which
flashed
upon
me
like
lightning
in
a
dark
night
revealing
to
the
lonely
traveler
the
gulf
before
and
the
enemy
behind
i
instantly
turned
to
sandy
jenkins
who
was
near
me
and
said
to
him
sandy
we
are
betrayed
something
has
just
told
me
i
felt
as
sure
of
it
as
if
the
officers
were
there
in
sight
sandy
said
man
dat
is
strange
but
i
feel
just
as
you
if
my
mother
then
long
in
her
grave
had
appeared
before
me
and
told
me
that
we
were
betrayed
i
could
not
at
that
moment
have
felt
more
certain
of
the
fact
in
a
few
minutes
after
this
the
long
low
and
distant
notes
of
the
horn
summoned
us
from
the
field
to
breakfast
i
felt
as
one
may
be
supposed
to
feel
before
being
led
forth
to
be
executed
for
some
great
offense
i
wanted
no
breakfast
but
i
went
with
the
other
slaves
toward
the
house
for
form
s
sake
my
feelings
were
not
disturbed
as
to
the
right
of
running
away
on
that
point
i
had
no
trouble
whatever
my
anxiety
arose
from
a
sense
of
the
consequences
of
failure
in
thirty
minutes
after
that
vivid
presentiment
came
the
apprehended
crash
on
reaching
the
house
for
breakfast
and
glancing
my
eye
toward
the
lane
gate
the
worst
was
at
once
made
known
the
lane
gate
off
freeland
s
house
is
nearly
a
half
mile
from
the
door
and
shaded
by
the
heavy
wood
which
bordered
the
main
road
i
was
however
able
to
descry
four
white
men
and
two
colored
men
approaching
the
white
men
were
on
horseback
and
the
colored
men
were
walking
behind
and
seemed
to
be
tied
it
is
all
over
with
us
thought
i
we
are
surely
i
now
became
composed
or
at
least
comparatively
so
and
calmly
awaited
the
result
i
watched
the
company
till
i
saw
them
enter
the
gate
successful
flight
was
impossible
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
stand
and
meet
the
evil
whatever
it
might
be
for
i
was
not
without
a
slight
hope
that
things
might
turn
differently
from
what
i
at
first
expected
in
a
few
moments
in
came
william
hamilton
riding
very
rapidly
and
evidently
much
excited
he
was
in
the
habit
of
riding
very
slowly
and
was
seldom
known
to
gallop
his
horse
this
time
his
horse
was
nearly
at
full
speed
causing
the
dust
to
roll
thick
behind
him
hamilton
though
one
of
the
most
resolute
men
in
the
whole
neighborhood
was
nevertheless
a
remarkably
mild
spoken
man
and
even
when
greatly
excited
his
language
was
cool
and
circumspect
he
came
to
the
door
and
inquired
if
freeland
was
in
i
told
him
that
freeland
was
at
the
barn
off
the
old
gentleman
rode
toward
the
barn
with
unwonted
speed
mary
the
cook
was
at
a
loss
to
know
what
was
the
matter
and
i
did
not
profess
any
skill
in
making
her
understand
i
knew
she
would
have
united
as
readily
as
any
one
in
cursing
me
for
bringing
trouble
into
the
family
so
i
held
my
peace
leaving
matters
to
develop
themselves
without
my
assistance
in
a
few
moments
hamilton
and
freeland
came
down
from
the
barn
to
the
house
and
just
as
they
made
their
appearance
in
the
front
yard
three
men
who
proved
to
be
constables
came
dashing
into
the
lane
on
horseback
as
if
summoned
by
a
sign
requiring
quick
work
a
few
seconds
brought
them
into
the
front
yard
where
they
hastily
dismounted
and
tied
their
horses
this
done
they
joined
freeland
and
hamilton
who
were
standing
a
short
distance
from
the
kitchen
a
few
moments
were
spent
as
if
in
consulting
how
to
proceed
and
then
the
whole
party
walked
up
to
the
kitchen
door
there
was
now
no
one
in
the
kitchen
but
myself
and
john
harris
henry
and
sandy
were
yet
at
the
barn
freeland
came
inside
the
kitchen
door
and
with
an
agitated
voice
called
me
by
name
and
told
me
to
come
forward
that
there
was
some
gentlemen
who
wished
to
see
me
i
stepped
toward
them
at
the
door
and
asked
what
they
wanted
when
the
constables
grabbed
me
and
told
me
that
i
had
better
not
resist
that
i
had
been
in
a
scrape
or
was
said
to
have
been
in
one
that
they
were
merely
going
to
take
me
where
i
could
be
examined
that
they
were
going
to
carry
me
to
michael
s
to
have
me
brought
before
my
master
they
further
said
that
in
case
the
evidence
against
me
was
not
true
i
should
be
acquitted
i
was
now
firmly
tied
and
completely
at
the
mercy
of
my
captors
resistance
was
idle
they
were
five
in
number
armed
to
the
very
teeth
when
they
had
secured
me
they
next
turned
to
john
harris
and
in
a
few
moments
succeeded
in
tying
him
as
firmly
as
they
had
already
tied
me
they
next
turned
toward
henry
harris
who
had
now
returned
from
the
barn
cross
your
hands
said
the
constables
to
henry
i
won
t
said
henry
in
a
voice
so
firm
and
clear
and
in
a
manner
so
determined
as
for
a
moment
to
arrest
all
proceedings
won
t
you
cross
your
hands
said
tom
graham
the
constable
i
won
said
henry
with
increasing
emphasis
hamilton
freeland
and
the
officers
now
came
near
to
henry
two
of
the
constables
drew
out
their
shining
pistols
and
swore
by
the
name
of
god
that
he
should
cross
his
hands
or
they
would
shoot
him
down
each
of
these
hired
ruffians
now
cocked
their
pistols
and
with
fingers
apparently
on
the
triggers
presented
their
deadly
weapons
to
the
breast
of
the
unarmed
slave
saying
at
the
same
time
if
he
did
not
cross
his
hands
they
would
blow
his
d
d
heart
out
of
shoot
shoot
me
said
henry
can
t
kill
me
but
shoot
shoot
and
be
d
won
t
be
this
the
brave
fellow
said
in
a
voice
as
defiant
and
heroic
in
its
tone
as
was
the
language
itself
and
at
the
moment
of
saying
this
with
the
pistols
at
his
very
breast
he
quickly
raised
his
arms
and
dashed
them
from
the
puny
hands
of
his
assassins
the
weapons
flying
in
opposite
directions
now
came
the
struggle
all
hands
was
now
rushed
upon
the
brave
fellow
and
after
beating
him
for
some
time
they
succeeded
in
overpowering
and
tying
him
henry
put
me
to
shame
he
fought
and
fought
bravely
john
and
i
had
made
no
resistance
the
fact
is
i
never
see
much
use
in
fighting
unless
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
of
whipping
somebody
yet
there
was
something
almost
providential
in
the
resistance
made
by
the
gallant
henry
but
for
that
resistance
every
soul
of
us
would
have
been
hurried
off
to
the
far
south
just
a
moment
previous
to
the
trouble
with
henry
hamilton
said
and
this
gave
me
the
unmistakable
clue
to
the
cause
of
our
arrest
perhaps
we
had
now
better
make
a
search
for
those
protections
which
we
understand
frederick
has
written
for
himself
and
the
had
these
passes
been
found
they
would
have
been
point
blank
proof
against
us
and
would
have
confirmed
all
the
statements
of
our
betrayer
thanks
to
the
resistance
of
henry
the
excitement
produced
by
the
scuffle
drew
all
attention
in
that
direction
and
i
succeeded
in
flinging
my
pass
unobserved
into
the
fire
the
confusion
attendant
upon
the
scuffle
and
the
apprehension
of
further
trouble
perhaps
led
our
captors
to
forego
for
the
present
any
search
for
those
protections
which
frederick
was
said
to
have
written
for
his
so
we
were
not
yet
convicted
of
the
purpose
to
run
away
and
it
was
evident
that
there
was
some
doubt
on
the
part
of
all
whether
we
had
been
guilty
of
such
a
purpose
just
as
we
were
all
completely
tied
and
about
ready
to
start
toward
michael
s
and
thence
to
jail
betsey
freeland
mother
to
william
who
was
very
much
attached
after
the
southern
fashion
to
henry
and
john
they
having
been
reared
from
childhood
in
her
house
came
to
the
kitchen
door
with
her
hands
full
of
biscuits
for
we
had
not
had
time
to
take
our
breakfast
that
morning
and
divided
them
between
henry
and
john
this
done
the
lady
made
the
following
parting
address
to
me
looking
and
pointing
her
bony
finger
at
me
you
devil
you
yellow
devil
it
was
you
that
put
it
into
the
heads
of
henry
and
john
to
run
away
but
for
you
legged
yellow
henry
and
john
would
never
have
thought
of
running
i
gave
the
lady
a
look
which
called
forth
a
scream
of
mingled
wrath
and
terror
as
she
slammed
the
kitchen
door
and
went
in
leaving
me
with
the
rest
in
hands
as
harsh
as
her
own
broken
voice
could
the
kind
reader
have
been
quietly
riding
along
the
main
road
to
or
from
easton
that
morning
his
eye
would
have
met
a
painful
sight
he
would
have
seen
five
young
men
guilty
of
no
crime
save
that
of
preferring
to
a
life
of
drawn
along
the
public
highway
firmly
bound
together
tramping
through
dust
and
heat
and
fastened
to
three
strong
horses
whose
riders
were
armed
to
the
teeth
with
pistols
and
daggers
on
their
way
to
prison
like
felons
and
suffering
every
possible
insult
from
the
crowds
of
idle
vulgar
people
who
clustered
around
and
heartlessly
made
their
failure
the
occasion
for
all
manner
of
ribaldry
and
sport
as
i
looked
upon
this
crowd
of
vile
persons
and
saw
myself
and
friends
thus
assailed
and
persecuted
i
could
not
help
seeing
the
fulfillment
of
sandy
s
dream
i
was
in
the
hands
of
moral
vultures
and
firmly
held
in
their
sharp
talons
and
was
hurried
away
toward
easton
in
a
direction
amid
the
jeers
of
new
birds
of
the
same
feather
through
every
neighborhood
we
passed
it
seemed
to
me
and
this
shows
the
good
understanding
between
the
slaveholders
and
their
allies
that
every
body
we
met
knew
the
cause
of
our
arrest
and
were
out
awaiting
our
passing
by
to
feast
their
vindictive
eyes
on
our
misery
and
to
gloat
over
our
ruin
some
said
ought
to
be
and
others
ought
to
be
others
i
ought
to
have
the
hide
taken
from
my
back
while
no
one
gave
us
a
kind
word
or
sympathizing
look
except
the
poor
slaves
who
were
lifting
their
heavy
hoes
and
who
cautiously
glanced
at
us
through
the
fences
behind
which
they
were
at
work
our
sufferings
that
morning
can
be
more
easily
imagined
than
described
our
hopes
were
all
blasted
at
a
blow
the
cruel
injustice
the
victorious
crime
and
the
helplessness
of
innocence
led
me
to
ask
in
my
ignorance
and
weakness
where
now
is
the
god
of
justice
and
mercy
and
why
have
these
wicked
men
the
power
thus
to
trample
upon
our
rights
and
to
insult
our
feelings
and
yet
in
the
next
moment
came
the
consoling
thought
the
day
of
oppressor
will
come
at
of
one
thing
i
could
be
glad
not
one
of
my
dear
friends
upon
whom
i
had
brought
this
great
calamity
either
by
word
or
look
reproached
me
for
having
led
them
into
it
we
were
a
band
of
brothers
and
never
dearer
to
each
other
than
now
the
thought
which
gave
us
the
most
pain
was
the
probable
separation
which
would
now
take
place
in
case
we
were
sold
off
to
the
far
south
as
we
were
likely
to
be
while
the
constables
were
looking
forward
henry
and
i
being
fastened
together
could
occasionally
exchange
a
word
without
being
observed
by
the
kidnappers
who
had
us
in
charge
what
shall
i
do
with
my
pass
said
henry
eat
it
with
your
biscuit
said
i
it
won
t
do
to
tear
it
we
were
now
near
michael
s
the
direction
concerning
the
passes
was
passed
around
and
executed
own
nothing
said
i
own
nothing
was
passed
around
and
enjoined
and
assented
to
our
confidence
in
each
other
was
unshaken
and
we
were
quite
resolved
to
succeed
or
fail
together
as
much
after
the
calamity
which
had
befallen
us
as
before
on
reaching
michael
s
we
underwent
a
sort
of
examination
at
my
master
s
store
and
it
was
evident
to
my
mind
that
master
thomas
suspected
the
truthfulness
of
the
evidence
upon
which
they
had
acted
in
arresting
us
and
that
he
only
affected
to
some
extent
the
positiveness
with
which
he
asserted
our
guilt
there
was
nothing
said
by
any
of
our
company
which
could
in
any
manner
prejudice
our
cause
and
there
was
hope
yet
that
we
should
be
able
to
return
to
our
homes
if
for
nothing
else
at
least
to
find
out
the
guilty
man
or
woman
who
had
betrayed
us
to
this
end
we
all
denied
that
we
had
been
guilty
of
intended
flight
master
thomas
said
that
the
evidence
he
had
of
our
intention
to
run
away
was
strong
enough
to
hang
us
in
a
case
of
murder
but
said
i
the
cases
are
not
equal
if
murder
were
committed
some
one
must
have
committed
it
the
thing
is
done
in
our
case
nothing
has
been
done
we
have
not
run
away
where
is
the
evidence
against
us
we
were
quietly
at
our
i
talked
thus
with
unusual
freedom
to
bring
out
the
evidence
against
us
for
we
all
wanted
above
all
things
to
know
the
guilty
wretch
who
had
betrayed
us
that
we
might
have
something
tangible
upon
which
to
pour
the
execrations
from
something
which
dropped
in
the
course
of
the
talk
it
appeared
that
there
was
but
one
witness
against
us
and
that
that
witness
could
not
be
produced
master
thomas
would
not
tell
us
his
informant
was
but
we
suspected
and
suspected
person
several
circumstances
seemed
to
point
sandy
out
as
our
betrayer
his
entire
knowledge
of
our
plans
his
participation
in
them
his
withdrawal
from
us
his
dream
and
his
simultaneous
presentiment
that
we
were
betrayed
the
taking
us
and
the
leaving
him
were
calculated
to
turn
suspicion
toward
him
and
yet
we
could
not
suspect
him
we
all
loved
him
too
well
to
think
it
that
he
could
have
betrayed
us
so
we
rolled
the
guilt
on
other
shoulders
we
were
literally
dragged
that
morning
behind
horses
a
distance
of
fifteen
miles
and
placed
in
the
easton
jail
we
were
glad
to
reach
the
end
of
our
journey
for
our
pathway
had
been
the
scene
of
insult
and
mortification
such
is
the
power
of
public
opinion
that
it
is
hard
even
for
the
innocent
to
feel
the
happy
consolations
of
innocence
when
they
fall
under
the
maledictions
of
this
power
how
could
we
regard
ourselves
as
in
the
right
when
all
about
us
denounced
us
as
criminals
and
had
the
power
and
the
disposition
to
treat
us
as
such
in
jail
we
were
placed
under
the
care
of
joseph
graham
the
sheriff
of
the
county
henry
and
john
and
myself
were
placed
in
one
room
and
henry
baily
and
charles
roberts
in
another
by
themselves
this
separation
was
intended
to
deprive
us
of
the
advantage
of
concert
and
to
prevent
trouble
in
jail
once
shut
up
a
new
set
of
tormentors
came
upon
us
a
swarm
of
imps
in
human
shape
the
deputy
and
agents
of
that
gather
in
every
country
town
of
the
state
watching
for
chances
to
buy
human
flesh
as
buzzards
to
eat
carrion
flocked
in
upon
us
to
ascertain
if
our
masters
had
placed
us
in
jail
to
be
sold
such
a
set
of
debased
and
villainous
creatures
i
never
saw
before
and
hope
never
to
see
again
i
felt
myself
surrounded
as
by
a
pack
of
fresh
from
they
laughed
leered
and
grinned
at
us
saying
ah
boys
we
ve
got
you
havn
t
we
so
you
were
about
to
make
your
escape
where
were
you
going
to
after
taunting
us
and
peering
at
us
as
long
as
they
liked
they
one
by
one
subjected
us
to
an
examination
with
a
view
to
ascertain
our
value
feeling
our
arms
and
legs
and
shaking
us
by
the
shoulders
to
see
if
we
were
sound
and
healthy
impudently
asking
us
how
we
would
like
to
have
them
for
masters
to
such
questions
we
were
very
much
to
their
annoyance
quite
dumb
disdaining
to
answer
them
for
one
i
detested
the
gamblers
in
human
flesh
and
i
believe
i
was
as
much
detested
by
them
in
turn
one
fellow
told
me
if
he
had
me
he
would
cut
the
devil
out
of
me
pretty
these
negro
buyers
are
very
offensive
to
the
genteel
southern
christian
public
they
are
looked
upon
in
respectable
maryland
society
as
necessary
but
detestable
characters
as
a
class
they
are
hardened
ruffians
made
such
by
nature
and
by
occupation
their
ears
are
made
quite
familiar
with
the
agonizing
cry
of
outraged
and
humanity
their
eyes
are
forever
open
to
human
misery
they
walk
amid
desecrated
affections
insulted
virtue
and
blasted
hopes
they
have
grown
intimate
with
vice
and
blood
they
gloat
over
the
wildest
illustrations
of
their
and
business
and
are
moral
pests
yes
they
are
a
legitimate
fruit
of
slavery
and
it
is
a
puzzle
to
make
out
a
case
of
greater
villainy
for
them
than
for
the
slaveholders
who
make
such
a
class
they
are
mere
hucksters
of
the
surplus
slave
produce
of
maryland
and
virginia
coarse
cruel
and
swaggering
bullies
whose
very
breathing
is
of
blasphemy
and
blood
aside
from
these
who
infested
the
prison
from
time
to
time
our
quarters
were
much
more
comfortable
than
we
had
any
right
to
expect
they
would
be
our
allowance
of
food
was
small
and
coarse
but
our
room
was
the
best
in
the
jail
neat
and
spacious
and
with
nothing
about
it
necessarily
reminding
us
of
being
in
prison
but
its
heavy
locks
and
bolts
and
the
black
iron
at
the
windows
we
were
prisoners
of
state
compared
with
most
slaves
who
are
put
into
that
easton
jail
but
the
place
was
not
one
of
contentment
bolts
bars
and
grated
windows
are
not
acceptable
to
people
of
any
color
the
suspense
too
was
painful
every
step
on
the
stairway
was
listened
to
in
the
hope
that
the
comer
would
cast
a
ray
of
light
on
our
fate
we
would
have
given
the
hair
off
our
heads
for
half
a
dozen
words
with
one
of
the
waiters
in
sol
lowe
s
hotel
such
waiters
were
in
the
way
of
hearing
at
the
table
the
probable
course
of
things
we
could
see
them
flitting
about
in
their
white
jackets
in
front
of
this
hotel
but
could
speak
to
none
of
them
soon
after
the
holidays
were
over
contrary
to
all
our
expectations
hamilton
and
freeland
came
up
to
easton
not
to
make
a
bargain
with
the
georgia
traders
nor
to
send
us
up
to
austin
woldfolk
as
is
usual
in
the
case
of
salves
but
to
release
charles
henry
harris
henry
baily
and
john
harris
from
prison
and
this
too
without
the
infliction
of
a
single
blow
i
was
now
left
entirely
alone
in
prison
the
innocent
had
been
taken
and
the
guilty
left
my
friends
were
separated
from
me
and
apparently
forever
this
circumstance
caused
me
more
pain
than
any
other
incident
connected
with
our
capture
and
imprisonment
lashes
on
my
naked
and
bleeding
back
would
have
been
joyfully
borne
in
preference
to
this
separation
from
these
the
friends
of
my
youth
and
yet
i
could
not
but
feel
that
i
was
the
victim
of
something
like
justice
why
should
these
young
men
who
were
led
into
this
scheme
by
me
suffer
as
much
as
the
instigator
i
felt
glad
that
they
were
leased
from
prison
and
from
the
dread
prospect
of
a
life
or
death
i
should
rather
say
in
the
rice
swamps
it
is
due
to
the
noble
henry
to
say
that
he
seemed
almost
as
reluctant
to
leave
the
prison
with
me
in
it
as
he
was
to
be
tied
and
dragged
to
prison
but
he
and
the
rest
knew
that
we
should
in
all
the
likelihoods
of
the
case
be
separated
in
the
event
of
being
sold
and
since
we
were
now
completely
in
the
hands
of
our
owners
we
all
concluded
it
would
be
best
to
go
peaceably
home
not
until
this
last
separation
dear
reader
had
i
touched
those
profounder
depths
of
desolation
which
it
is
the
lot
of
slaves
often
to
reach
i
was
solitary
in
the
world
and
alone
within
the
walls
of
a
stone
prison
left
to
a
fate
of
misery
i
had
hoped
and
expected
much
for
months
before
but
my
hopes
and
expectations
were
now
withered
and
blasted
the
ever
dreaded
slave
life
in
georgia
louisiana
and
alabama
from
which
escape
is
next
to
impossible
now
in
my
loneliness
stared
me
in
the
face
the
possibility
of
ever
becoming
anything
but
an
abject
slave
a
mere
machine
in
the
hands
of
an
owner
had
now
fled
and
it
seemed
to
me
it
had
fled
forever
a
life
of
living
death
beset
with
the
innumerable
horrors
of
the
cotton
field
and
the
sugar
plantation
seemed
to
be
my
doom
the
fiends
who
rushed
into
the
prison
when
we
were
first
put
there
continued
to
visit
me
and
to
ply
me
with
questions
and
with
their
tantalizing
remarks
i
was
insulted
but
helpless
keenly
alive
to
the
demands
of
justice
and
liberty
but
with
no
means
of
asserting
them
to
talk
to
those
imps
about
justice
and
mercy
would
have
been
as
absurd
as
to
reason
with
bears
and
tigers
lead
and
steel
are
the
only
arguments
that
they
understand
after
remaining
in
this
life
of
misery
and
despair
about
a
week
which
by
the
way
seemed
a
month
master
thomas
very
much
to
my
surprise
and
greatly
to
my
relief
came
to
the
prison
and
took
me
out
for
the
purpose
as
he
said
of
sending
me
to
alabama
with
a
friend
of
his
who
would
emancipate
me
at
the
end
of
eight
years
i
was
glad
enough
to
get
out
of
prison
but
i
had
no
faith
in
the
story
that
this
friend
of
capt
auld
would
emancipate
me
at
the
end
of
the
time
indicated
besides
i
never
had
heard
of
his
having
a
friend
in
alabama
and
i
took
the
announcement
simply
as
an
easy
and
comfortable
method
of
shipping
me
off
to
the
far
south
there
was
a
little
scandal
too
connected
with
the
idea
of
one
christian
selling
another
to
the
georgia
traders
while
it
was
deemed
every
way
proper
for
them
to
sell
to
others
i
thought
this
friend
in
alabama
was
an
invention
to
meet
this
difficulty
for
master
thomas
was
quite
jealous
of
his
christian
reputation
however
unconcerned
he
might
be
about
his
real
christian
character
in
these
remarks
however
it
is
possible
that
i
do
master
thomas
auld
injustice
he
certainly
did
not
exhaust
his
power
upon
me
in
the
case
but
acted
upon
the
whole
very
generously
considering
the
nature
of
my
offense
he
had
the
power
and
the
provocation
to
send
me
without
reserve
into
the
very
everglades
of
florida
beyond
the
remotest
hope
of
emancipation
and
his
refusal
to
exercise
that
power
must
be
set
down
to
his
credit
after
lingering
about
michael
s
a
few
days
and
no
friend
from
alabama
making
his
appearance
to
take
me
there
master
thomas
decided
to
send
me
back
again
to
baltimore
to
live
with
his
brother
hugh
with
whom
he
was
now
at
peace
possibly
he
became
so
by
his
profession
of
religion
at
the
in
the
bay
side
master
thomas
told
me
that
he
wished
me
to
go
to
baltimore
and
learn
a
trade
and
that
if
i
behaved
myself
properly
he
would
me
at
thanks
for
this
one
beam
of
hope
in
the
future
the
promise
had
but
one
fault
it
seemed
too
good
to
be
true

well
dear
reader
i
am
not
as
you
may
have
already
inferred
a
loser
by
the
general
upstir
described
in
the
foregoing
chapter
the
little
domestic
revolution
notwithstanding
the
sudden
snub
it
got
by
the
treachery
of
somebody
i
dare
not
say
or
think
who
did
not
after
all
end
so
disastrously
as
when
in
the
iron
cage
at
easton
i
conceived
it
would
the
prospect
from
that
point
did
look
about
as
dark
as
any
that
ever
cast
its
gloom
over
the
vision
of
the
anxious
human
spirit
all
is
well
that
ends
my
affectionate
comrades
henry
and
john
harris
are
still
with
william
freeland
charles
roberts
and
henry
baily
are
safe
at
their
homes
i
have
not
therefore
any
thing
to
regret
on
their
account
their
masters
have
mercifully
forgiven
them
probably
on
the
ground
suggested
in
the
spirited
little
speech
of
freeland
made
to
me
just
before
leaving
for
the
jail
namely
that
they
had
been
allured
into
the
wicked
scheme
of
making
their
escape
by
me
and
that
but
for
me
they
would
never
have
dreamed
of
a
thing
so
shocking
my
friends
had
nothing
to
regret
either
for
while
they
were
watched
more
closely
on
account
of
what
had
happened
they
were
doubtless
treated
more
kindly
than
before
and
got
new
assurances
that
they
would
be
legally
emancipated
some
day
provided
their
behavior
should
make
them
deserving
from
that
time
forward
not
a
blow
as
i
learned
was
struck
any
one
of
them
as
for
master
william
freeland
good
unsuspecting
soul
he
did
not
believe
that
we
were
intending
to
run
away
at
all
having
given
as
he
thought
no
occasion
to
his
boys
to
leave
him
he
could
not
think
it
probable
that
they
had
entertained
a
design
so
grievous
this
however
was
not
the
view
taken
of
the
matter
by
mas
billy
as
we
used
to
call
the
soft
spoken
but
crafty
and
resolute
william
hamilton
he
had
no
doubt
that
the
crime
had
been
meditated
and
regarding
me
as
the
instigator
of
it
he
frankly
told
master
thomas
that
he
must
remove
me
from
that
neighborhood
or
he
would
shoot
me
down
he
would
not
have
one
so
dangerous
as
frederick
tampering
with
his
slaves
william
hamilton
was
not
a
man
whose
threat
might
be
safely
disregarded
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
would
have
proved
as
good
as
his
word
had
the
warning
given
not
been
promptly
taken
he
was
furious
at
the
thought
of
such
a
piece
of
as
we
were
about
to
perpetrate
the
stealing
of
our
own
bodies
and
souls
the
feasibility
of
the
plan
too
could
the
first
steps
have
been
taken
was
marvelously
plain
besides
this
was
a
idea
this
use
of
the
bay
slaves
escaping
until
now
had
taken
to
the
woods
they
had
never
dreamed
of
profaning
and
abusing
the
waters
of
the
noble
chesapeake
by
making
them
the
highway
from
slavery
to
freedom
here
was
a
broad
road
of
destruction
to
slavery
which
before
had
been
looked
upon
as
a
wall
of
security
by
slaveholders
but
master
billy
could
not
get
freeland
to
see
matters
precisely
as
he
did
nor
could
he
get
master
thomas
so
excited
as
he
was
himself
the
latter
i
must
say
it
to
his
credit
showed
much
humane
feeling
in
his
part
of
the
transaction
and
atoned
for
much
that
had
been
harsh
cruel
and
unreasonable
in
his
former
treatment
of
me
and
others
his
clemency
was
quite
unusual
and
unlooked
for
cousin
tom
told
me
that
while
i
was
in
jail
master
thomas
was
very
unhappy
and
that
the
night
before
his
going
up
to
release
me
he
had
walked
the
floor
nearly
all
night
evincing
great
distress
that
very
tempting
offers
had
been
made
to
him
by
the
but
he
had
rejected
them
all
saying
that
could
not
tempt
him
to
sell
me
to
the
far
all
this
i
can
easily
believe
for
he
seemed
quite
reluctant
to
send
me
away
at
all
he
told
me
that
he
only
consented
to
do
so
because
of
the
very
strong
prejudice
against
me
in
the
neighborhood
and
that
he
feared
for
my
safety
if
i
remained
there
thus
after
three
years
spent
in
the
country
roughing
it
in
the
field
and
experiencing
all
sorts
of
hardships
i
was
again
permitted
to
return
to
baltimore
the
very
place
of
all
others
short
of
a
free
state
where
i
most
desired
to
live
the
three
years
spent
in
the
country
had
made
some
difference
in
me
and
in
the
household
of
master
hugh
little
tommy
was
no
longer
tommy
and
i
was
not
the
slender
lad
who
had
left
for
the
eastern
shore
just
three
years
before
the
loving
relations
between
me
and
mas
tommy
were
broken
up
he
was
no
longer
dependent
on
me
for
protection
but
felt
himself
a
with
other
and
more
suitable
associates
in
childhood
he
scarcely
considered
me
inferior
to
himself
certainly
as
good
as
any
other
boy
with
whom
he
played
but
the
time
had
come
when
his
must
become
his
so
we
were
cold
and
we
parted
it
was
a
sad
thing
to
me
that
loving
each
other
as
we
had
done
we
must
now
take
different
roads
to
him
a
thousand
avenues
were
open
education
had
made
him
acquainted
with
all
the
treasures
of
the
world
and
liberty
had
flung
open
the
gates
thereunto
but
i
who
had
attended
him
seven
years
and
had
watched
over
him
with
the
care
of
a
big
brother
fighting
his
battles
in
the
street
and
shielding
him
from
harm
to
an
extent
which
had
induced
his
mother
to
say
oh
tommy
is
always
safe
when
he
is
with
freddy
must
be
confined
to
a
single
condition
he
could
grow
and
become
a
man
i
could
grow
though
i
could
become
a
man
but
must
remain
all
my
life
a
minor
a
mere
boy
thomas
auld
junior
obtained
a
situation
on
board
the
brig
tweed
and
went
to
sea
i
know
not
what
has
become
of
him
he
certainly
has
my
good
wishes
for
his
welfare
and
prosperity
there
were
few
persons
to
whom
i
was
more
sincerely
attached
than
to
him
and
there
are
few
in
the
world
i
would
be
more
pleased
to
meet
very
soon
after
i
went
to
baltimore
to
live
master
hugh
succeeded
in
getting
me
hired
to
william
gardiner
an
extensive
ship
builder
on
fell
s
point
i
was
placed
here
to
learn
to
calk
a
trade
of
which
i
already
had
some
knowledge
gained
while
in
hugh
auld
s
when
he
was
a
master
builder
gardiner
s
however
proved
a
very
unfavorable
place
for
the
accomplishment
of
that
object
gardiner
was
that
season
engaged
in
building
two
large
vessels
professedly
for
the
mexican
government
these
vessels
were
to
be
launched
in
the
month
of
july
of
that
year
and
in
failure
thereof
would
forfeit
a
very
considerable
sum
of
money
so
when
i
entered
the
all
was
hurry
and
driving
there
were
in
the
yard
about
one
hundred
men
of
these
about
seventy
or
eighty
were
regular
carpenters
privileged
men
speaking
of
my
condition
here
i
wrote
years
ago
and
i
have
now
no
reason
to
vary
the
picture
as
follows
there
was
no
time
to
learn
any
thing
every
man
had
to
do
that
which
he
knew
how
to
do
in
entering
the
my
orders
from
gardiner
were
to
do
whatever
the
carpenters
commanded
me
to
do
this
was
placing
me
at
the
beck
and
call
of
about
men
i
was
to
regard
all
these
as
masters
their
word
was
to
be
my
law
my
situation
was
a
most
trying
one
at
times
i
needed
a
dozen
pair
of
hands
i
was
called
a
dozen
ways
in
the
space
of
a
single
minute
three
or
four
voices
would
strike
my
ear
at
the
same
moment
it
was
come
help
me
to
cant
this
timber
come
carry
this
timber
bring
that
roller
go
get
a
fresh
can
of
come
help
saw
off
the
end
of
this
go
quick
and
get
the
crow
hold
on
the
end
of
this
go
to
the
blacksmith
s
shop
and
get
a
new
hurra
run
and
bring
me
a
cold
i
say
bear
a
hand
and
get
up
a
fire
as
quick
as
lightning
under
that
halloo
nigger
come
turn
this

come

this
timber
i
say
darkey
blast
your
eyes
why
don
t
you
heat
up
some
pitch
halloo
halloo
halloo
three
voices
at
the
same
time
come
here
go
there
hold
on
where
you
are
d
n
you
if
you
move
i
ll
knock
your
brains
out
such
dear
reader
is
a
glance
at
the
school
which
was
mine
during
the
first
eight
months
of
my
stay
at
baltimore
at
the
end
of
the
eight
months
master
hugh
refused
longer
to
allow
me
to
remain
with
gardiner
the
circumstance
which
led
to
his
taking
me
away
was
a
brutal
outrage
committed
upon
me
by
the
white
apprentices
of
the
the
fight
was
a
desperate
one
and
i
came
out
of
it
most
shockingly
mangled
i
was
cut
and
bruised
in
sundry
places
and
my
left
eye
was
nearly
knocked
out
of
its
socket
the
facts
leading
to
this
barbarous
outrage
upon
me
illustrate
a
phase
of
slavery
destined
to
become
an
important
element
in
the
overthrow
of
the
slave
system
and
i
may
therefore
state
them
with
some
minuteness
that
phase
is
this
conflict
of
slavery
with
the
interests
of
the
white
mechanics
and
laborers
of
the
in
the
country
this
conflict
is
not
so
apparent
but
in
cities
such
as
baltimore
richmond
new
orleans
mobile
it
is
seen
pretty
clearly
the
slaveholders
with
a
craftiness
peculiar
to
themselves
by
encouraging
the
enmity
of
the
poor
laboring
white
man
against
the
blacks
succeeds
in
making
the
said
white
man
almost
as
much
a
slave
as
the
black
slave
himself
the
difference
between
the
white
slave
and
the
black
slave
is
this
the
latter
belongs
to
slaveholder
and
the
former
belongs
to
the
slaveholders
collectively
the
white
slave
has
taken
from
him
by
indirection
what
the
black
slave
has
taken
from
him
directly
and
without
ceremony
both
are
plundered
and
by
the
same
plunderers
the
slave
is
robbed
by
his
master
of
all
his
earnings
above
what
is
required
for
his
bare
physical
necessities
and
the
white
man
is
robbed
by
the
slave
system
of
the
just
results
of
his
labor
because
he
is
flung
into
competition
with
a
class
of
laborers
who
work
without
wages
the
competition
and
its
injurious
consequences
will
one
day
array
the
nonslaveholding
white
people
of
the
slave
states
against
the
slave
system
and
make
them
the
most
effective
workers
against
the
great
evil
at
present
the
slaveholders
blind
them
to
this
competition
by
keeping
alive
their
prejudice
against
the
slaves
not
against
them
they
appeal
to
their
pride
often
denouncing
emancipation
as
tending
to
place
the
white
man
on
an
equality
with
negroes
and
by
this
means
they
succeed
in
drawing
off
the
minds
of
the
poor
whites
from
the
real
fact
that
by
the
rich
they
are
already
regarded
as
but
a
single
remove
from
equality
with
the
slave
the
impression
is
cunningly
made
that
slavery
is
the
only
power
that
can
prevent
the
laboring
white
man
from
falling
to
the
level
of
the
slave
s
poverty
and
degradation
to
make
this
enmity
deep
and
broad
between
the
slave
and
the
poor
white
man
the
latter
is
allowed
to
abuse
and
whip
the
former
without
hinderance
but
as
i
have
suggested
this
state
of
facts
prevails
in
the
country
in
the
city
of
baltimore
there
are
not
unfrequent
murmurs
that
educating
the
slaves
to
be
mechanics
may
in
the
end
give
slavemasters
power
to
dispense
with
the
services
of
the
poor
white
man
altogether
but
with
characteristic
dread
of
offending
the
slaveholders
these
poor
white
mechanics
in
gardiner
s
instead
of
applying
the
natural
honest
remedy
for
the
apprehended
evil
and
objecting
at
once
to
work
there
by
the
side
of
slaves
made
a
cowardly
attack
upon
the
free
colored
mechanics
saying
were
eating
the
bread
which
should
be
eaten
by
american
freemen
and
swearing
that
they
would
not
work
with
them
the
feeling
was
against
having
their
labor
brought
into
competition
with
that
of
the
colored
people
at
all
but
it
was
too
much
to
strike
directly
at
the
interest
of
the
slaveholders
and
therefore
proving
their
servility
and
cowardice
they
dealt
their
blows
on
the
poor
colored
freeman
and
aimed
to
prevent
from
serving
himself
in
the
evening
of
life
with
the
trade
with
which
he
had
served
his
master
during
the
more
vigorous
portion
of
his
days
had
they
succeeded
in
driving
the
black
freemen
out
of
the
they
would
have
determined
also
upon
the
removal
of
the
black
slaves
the
feeling
was
very
bitter
toward
all
colored
people
in
baltimore
about
this
time
and
they
free
and
slave
suffered
all
manner
of
insult
and
wrong
until
a
very
little
before
i
went
there
white
and
black
ship
carpenters
worked
side
by
side
in
the
ship
yards
of
gardiner
duncan
walter
price
and
robb
nobody
seemed
to
see
any
impropriety
in
it
to
outward
seeming
all
hands
were
well
satisfied
some
of
the
blacks
were
first
rate
workmen
and
were
given
jobs
requiring
highest
skill
all
at
once
however
the
white
carpenters
knocked
off
and
swore
that
they
would
no
longer
work
on
the
same
stage
with
free
negroes
taking
advantage
of
the
heavy
contract
resting
upon
gardiner
to
have
the
war
vessels
for
mexico
ready
to
launch
in
july
and
of
the
difficulty
of
getting
other
hands
at
that
season
of
the
year
they
swore
they
would
not
strike
another
blow
for
him
unless
he
would
discharge
his
free
colored
workmen
now
although
this
movement
did
not
extend
to
me
it
did
reach
me
the
spirit
which
it
awakened
was
one
of
malice
and
bitterness
toward
colored
people
and
i
suffered
with
the
rest
and
suffered
severely
my
fellow
apprentices
very
soon
began
to
feel
it
to
be
degrading
to
work
with
me
they
began
to
put
on
high
looks
and
to
talk
contemptuously
and
maliciously
of
the
niggers
saying
that
they
would
take
the
country
that
they
ought
to
be
encouraged
by
the
cowardly
workmen
who
knowing
me
to
be
a
slave
made
no
issue
with
gardiner
about
my
being
there
these
young
men
did
their
utmost
to
make
it
impossible
for
me
to
stay
they
seldom
called
me
to
do
any
thing
without
coupling
the
call
with
a
curse
and
edward
north
the
biggest
in
every
thing
rascality
included
ventured
to
strike
me
whereupon
i
picked
him
up
and
threw
him
into
the
dock
whenever
any
of
them
struck
me
i
struck
back
again
regardless
of
consequences
i
could
manage
any
of
them
and
while
i
could
keep
them
from
combining
i
succeeded
very
well
in
the
conflict
which
ended
my
stay
at
gardiner
s
i
was
beset
by
four
of
them
at
once
ned
north
ned
hays
bill
stewart
and
tom
humphreys
two
of
them
were
as
large
as
myself
and
they
came
near
killing
me
in
broad
day
light
the
attack
was
made
suddenly
and
simultaneously
one
came
in
front
armed
with
a
brick
there
was
one
at
each
side
and
one
behind
and
they
closed
up
around
me
i
was
struck
on
all
sides
and
while
i
was
attending
to
those
in
front
i
received
a
blow
on
my
head
from
behind
dealt
with
a
heavy
i
was
completely
stunned
by
the
blow
and
fell
heavily
on
the
ground
among
the
timbers
taking
advantage
of
my
fall
they
rushed
upon
me
and
began
to
pound
me
with
their
fists
i
let
them
lay
on
for
a
while
after
i
came
to
myself
with
a
view
of
gaining
strength
they
did
me
little
damage
so
far
but
finally
getting
tired
of
that
sport
i
gave
a
sudden
surge
and
despite
their
weight
i
rose
to
my
hands
and
knees
just
as
i
did
this
one
of
their
number
i
know
not
which
planted
a
blow
with
his
boot
in
my
left
eye
which
for
a
time
seemed
to
have
burst
my
eyeball
when
they
saw
my
eye
completely
closed
my
face
covered
with
blood
and
i
staggering
under
the
stunning
blows
they
had
given
me
they
left
me
as
soon
as
i
gathered
sufficient
strength
i
picked
up
the
and
madly
enough
attempted
to
pursue
them
but
here
the
carpenters
interfered
and
compelled
me
to
give
up
my
frenzied
pursuit
it
was
impossible
to
stand
against
so
many
dear
reader
you
can
hardly
believe
the
statement
but
it
is
true
and
therefore
i
write
it
down
not
fewer
than
fifty
white
men
stood
by
and
saw
this
brutal
and
shameless
outrage
committed
and
not
a
man
of
them
all
interposed
a
single
word
of
mercy
there
were
four
against
one
and
that
one
s
face
was
beaten
and
battered
most
horribly
and
no
one
said
that
is
enough
but
some
cried
out
kill
him
kill
him
kill
the
d
d
nigger
knock
his
brains
out
he
struck
a
white
i
mention
this
inhuman
outcry
to
show
the
character
of
the
men
and
the
spirit
of
the
times
at
gardiner
s
ship
yard
and
indeed
in
baltimore
generally
in
as
i
look
back
to
this
period
i
am
almost
amazed
that
i
was
not
murdered
outright
in
that
ship
yard
so
murderous
was
the
spirit
which
prevailed
there
on
two
occasions
while
there
i
came
near
losing
my
life
i
was
driving
bolts
in
the
hold
through
the
keelson
with
hays
in
its
course
the
bolt
bent
hays
cursed
me
and
said
that
it
was
my
blow
which
bent
the
bolt
i
denied
this
and
charged
it
upon
him
in
a
fit
of
rage
he
seized
an
adze
and
darted
toward
me
i
met
him
with
a
maul
and
parried
his
blow
or
i
should
have
then
lost
my
life
a
son
of
old
tom
lanman
the
latter
s
double
murder
i
have
elsewhere
charged
upon
him
in
the
spirit
of
his
miserable
father
made
an
assault
upon
me
but
the
blow
with
his
maul
missed
me
after
the
united
assault
of
north
stewart
hays
and
humphreys
finding
that
the
carpenters
were
as
bitter
toward
me
as
the
apprentices
and
that
the
latter
were
probably
set
on
by
the
former
i
found
my
only
chances
for
life
was
in
flight
i
succeeded
in
getting
away
without
an
additional
blow
to
strike
a
white
man
was
death
by
lynch
law
in
gardiner
s
ship
yard
nor
was
there
much
of
any
other
law
toward
colored
people
at
that
time
in
any
other
part
of
maryland
the
whole
sentiment
of
baltimore
was
murderous
after
making
my
escape
from
the
ship
yard
i
went
straight
home
and
related
the
story
of
the
outrage
to
master
hugh
auld
and
it
is
due
to
him
to
say
that
his
conduct
though
he
was
not
a
religious
man
was
every
way
more
humane
than
that
of
his
brother
thomas
when
i
went
to
the
latter
in
a
somewhat
similar
plight
from
the
hands
of
brother
edward
he
listened
attentively
to
my
narration
of
the
circumstances
leading
to
the
ruffianly
outrage
and
gave
many
proofs
of
his
strong
indignation
at
what
was
done
hugh
was
a
rough
but
fellow
and
at
this
time
his
best
nature
showed
itself
the
heart
of
my
once
almost
mistress
sophia
was
again
melted
in
pity
toward
me
my
eye
and
my
scarred
and
face
moved
the
dear
lady
to
tears
she
kindly
drew
a
chair
by
me
and
with
friendly
consoling
words
she
took
water
and
washed
the
blood
from
my
face
no
mother
s
hand
could
have
been
more
tender
than
hers
she
bound
up
my
head
and
covered
my
wounded
eye
with
a
lean
piece
of
fresh
beef
it
was
almost
compensation
for
the
murderous
assault
and
my
suffering
that
it
furnished
and
occasion
for
the
manifestation
once
more
of
the
orignally
sic
characteristic
kindness
of
my
mistress
her
affectionate
heart
was
not
yet
dead
though
much
hardened
by
time
and
by
circumstances
as
for
master
hugh
s
part
as
i
have
said
he
was
furious
about
it
and
he
gave
expression
to
his
fury
in
the
usual
forms
of
speech
in
that
locality
he
poured
curses
on
the
heads
of
the
whole
ship
yard
company
and
swore
that
he
would
have
satisfaction
for
the
outrage
his
indignation
was
really
strong
and
healthy
but
unfortunately
it
resulted
from
the
thought
that
his
rights
of
property
in
my
person
had
not
been
respected
more
than
from
any
sense
of
the
outrage
committed
on
me
a
i
inferred
as
much
as
this
from
the
fact
that
he
could
himself
beat
and
mangle
when
it
suited
him
to
do
so
bent
on
having
satisfaction
as
he
said
just
as
soon
as
i
got
a
little
the
better
of
my
bruises
master
hugh
took
me
to
esquire
watson
s
office
on
bond
street
fell
s
point
with
a
view
to
procuring
the
arrest
of
those
who
had
assaulted
me
he
related
the
outrage
to
the
magistrate
as
i
had
related
it
to
him
and
seemed
to
expect
that
a
warrant
would
at
once
be
issued
for
the
arrest
of
the
lawless
ruffians
watson
heard
it
all
and
instead
of
drawing
up
his
warrant
he
mr
auld
who
saw
this
assault
of
which
you
speak
it
was
done
sir
in
the
presence
of
a
ship
yard
full
of
sir
said
watson
i
am
sorry
but
i
can
not
move
in
this
matter
except
upon
the
oath
of
white
but
here
s
the
boy
look
at
his
head
and
face
said
the
excited
master
hugh
show
has
been
but
watson
insisted
that
he
was
not
authorized
to
do
anything
unless
witnesses
of
the
transaction
would
come
forward
and
testify
to
what
had
taken
place
he
could
issue
no
warrant
on
my
word
against
white
persons
and
if
i
had
been
killed
in
the
presence
of
a
their
testimony
combined
would
have
been
insufficient
to
arrest
a
single
murderer
master
hugh
for
once
was
compelled
to
say
that
this
state
of
things
was
bad
and
he
left
the
office
of
the
magistrate
disgusted
of
course
it
was
impossible
to
get
any
white
man
to
testify
against
my
assailants
the
carpenters
saw
what
was
done
but
the
actors
were
but
the
agents
of
their
malice
and
only
what
the
carpenters
sanctioned
they
had
cried
with
one
accord
kill
the
nigger
kill
the
nigger
even
those
who
may
have
pitied
me
if
any
such
were
among
them
lacked
the
moral
courage
to
come
and
volunteer
their
evidence
the
slightest
manifestation
of
sympathy
or
justice
toward
a
person
of
color
was
denounced
as
abolitionism
and
the
name
of
abolitionist
subjected
its
bearer
to
frightful
liabilities
d
n
and
kill
the
niggers
were
the
of
the
ruffians
of
those
days
nothing
was
done
and
probably
there
would
not
have
been
any
thing
done
had
i
been
killed
in
the
affray
the
laws
and
the
morals
of
the
christian
city
of
baltimore
afforded
no
protection
to
the
sable
denizens
of
that
city
master
hugh
on
finding
he
could
get
no
redress
for
the
cruel
wrong
withdrew
me
from
the
employment
of
gardiner
and
took
me
into
his
own
family
auld
kindly
taking
care
of
me
and
dressing
my
wounds
until
they
were
healed
and
i
was
ready
to
go
again
to
work
while
i
was
on
the
eastern
shore
master
hugh
had
met
with
reverses
which
overthrew
his
business
and
he
had
given
up
ship
building
in
his
own
yard
on
the
city
block
and
was
now
acting
as
foreman
of
walter
price
the
best
he
could
now
do
for
me
was
to
take
me
into
price
s
yard
and
afford
me
the
facilities
there
for
completing
the
trade
which
i
had
began
to
learn
at
gardiner
s
here
i
rapidly
became
expert
in
the
use
of
my
calking
tools
and
in
the
course
of
a
single
year
i
was
able
to
command
the
highest
wages
paid
to
journeymen
calkers
in
baltimore
the
reader
will
observe
that
i
was
now
of
some
pecuniary
value
to
my
master
during
the
busy
season
i
was
bringing
six
and
seven
dollars
per
week
i
have
sometimes
brought
him
as
much
as
nine
dollars
a
week
for
the
wages
were
a
dollar
and
a
half
per
day
after
learning
to
calk
i
sought
my
own
employment
made
my
own
contracts
and
collected
my
own
earnings
giving
master
hugh
no
trouble
in
any
part
of
the
transactions
to
which
i
was
a
party
here
then
were
better
days
for
the
eastern
shore
i
was
now
free
from
the
vexatious
assalts
sic
of
the
apprentices
at
gardiner
s
and
free
from
the
perils
of
plantation
life
and
once
more
in
a
favorable
condition
to
increase
my
little
stock
of
education
which
had
been
at
a
dead
stand
since
my
removal
from
baltimore
i
had
on
the
eastern
shore
been
only
a
teacher
when
in
company
with
other
slaves
but
now
there
were
colored
persons
who
could
instruct
me
many
of
the
young
calkers
could
read
write
and
cipher
some
of
them
had
high
notions
about
mental
improvement
and
the
free
ones
on
fell
s
point
organized
what
they
called
the
east
baltimore
mental
improvement
to
this
society
notwithstanding
it
was
intended
that
only
free
persons
should
attach
themselves
i
was
admitted
and
was
several
times
assigned
a
prominent
part
in
its
debates
i
owe
much
to
the
society
of
these
young
men
the
reader
already
knows
enough
of
the
effects
of
good
treatment
on
a
slave
to
anticipate
what
was
now
the
case
in
my
improved
condition
it
was
not
long
before
i
began
to
show
signs
of
disquiet
with
slavery
and
to
look
around
for
means
to
get
out
of
that
condition
by
the
shortest
route
i
was
living
among
and
was
in
all
respects
equal
to
them
by
nature
and
by
attainments
should
i
be
a
slave
there
was
reason
why
i
should
be
the
thrall
of
any
man
besides
i
was
now
getting
as
i
have
said
a
dollar
and
fifty
cents
per
day
i
contracted
for
it
worked
for
it
earned
it
collected
it
it
was
paid
to
me
and
it
was
my
own
and
yet
upon
every
returning
saturday
night
this
money
my
own
hard
earnings
every
cent
of
it
was
demanded
of
me
and
taken
from
me
by
master
hugh
he
did
not
earn
it
he
had
no
hand
in
earning
it
why
then
should
he
have
it
i
owed
him
nothing
he
had
given
me
no
schooling
and
i
had
received
from
him
only
my
food
and
raiment
and
for
these
my
services
were
supposed
to
pay
from
the
first
the
right
to
take
my
earnings
was
the
right
of
the
robber
he
had
the
power
to
compel
me
to
give
him
the
fruits
of
my
labor
and
this
power
was
his
only
right
in
the
case
i
became
more
and
more
dissatisfied
with
this
state
of
things
and
in
so
becoming
i
only
gave
proof
of
the
same
human
nature
which
every
reader
of
this
chapter
in
my
life
slaveholder
or
nonslaveholder
is
conscious
of
possessing
to
make
a
contented
slave
you
must
make
a
thoughtless
one
it
is
necessary
to
darken
his
moral
and
mental
vision
and
as
far
as
possible
to
annihilate
his
power
of
reason
he
must
be
able
to
detect
no
inconsistencies
in
slavery
the
man
that
takes
his
earnings
must
be
able
to
convince
him
that
he
has
a
perfect
right
to
do
so
it
must
not
depend
upon
mere
force
the
slave
must
know
no
higher
law
than
his
master
s
will
the
whole
relationship
must
not
only
demonstrate
to
his
mind
its
necessity
but
its
absolute
rightfulness
if
there
be
one
crevice
through
which
a
single
drop
can
fall
it
will
certainly
rust
off
the
slave
s
chain

success
i
will
now
make
the
kind
reader
acquainted
with
the
closing
incidents
of
my
life
as
a
slave
having
already
trenched
upon
the
limit
allotted
to
my
life
as
a
before
however
proceeding
with
this
narration
it
is
perhaps
proper
that
i
should
frankly
state
in
advance
my
intention
to
withhold
a
part
of
the
sic
connected
with
my
escape
from
slavery
there
are
reasons
for
this
suppression
which
i
trust
the
reader
will
deem
altogether
valid
it
may
be
easily
conceived
that
a
full
and
complete
statement
of
all
facts
pertaining
to
the
flight
of
a
bondman
might
implicate
and
embarrass
some
who
may
have
wittingly
or
unwittingly
assisted
him
and
no
one
can
wish
me
to
involve
any
man
or
woman
who
has
befriended
me
even
in
the
liability
of
embarrassment
or
trouble
keen
is
the
scent
of
the
slaveholder
like
the
fangs
of
the
rattlesnake
his
malice
retains
its
poison
long
and
although
it
is
now
nearly
seventeen
years
since
i
made
my
escape
it
is
well
to
be
careful
in
dealing
with
the
circumstances
relating
to
it
were
i
to
give
but
a
shadowy
outline
of
the
process
adopted
with
characteristic
aptitude
the
crafty
and
malicious
among
the
slaveholders
might
possibly
hit
upon
the
track
i
pursued
and
involve
some
one
in
suspicion
which
in
a
slave
state
is
about
as
bad
as
positive
evidence
the
colored
man
there
must
not
only
shun
evil
but
shun
the
very
of
evil
or
be
condemned
as
a
criminal
a
slaveholding
community
has
a
peculiar
taste
for
ferreting
out
offenses
against
the
slave
system
justice
there
being
more
sensitive
in
its
regard
for
the
peculiar
rights
of
this
system
than
for
any
other
interest
or
institution
by
stringing
together
a
train
of
events
and
circumstances
even
if
i
were
not
very
explicit
the
means
of
escape
might
be
ascertained
and
possibly
those
means
be
rendered
thereafter
no
longer
available
to
the
children
of
bondage
i
have
left
behind
me
no
antislavery
man
can
wish
me
to
do
anything
favoring
such
results
and
no
slaveholding
reader
has
any
right
to
expect
the
impartment
of
such
information
while
therefore
it
would
afford
me
pleasure
and
perhaps
would
materially
add
to
the
interest
of
my
story
were
i
at
liberty
to
gratify
a
curiosity
which
i
know
to
exist
in
the
minds
of
many
as
to
the
manner
of
my
escape
i
must
deprive
myself
of
this
pleasure
and
the
curious
of
the
gratification
which
such
a
statement
of
facts
would
afford
i
would
allow
myself
to
suffer
under
the
greatest
imputations
that
evil
minded
men
might
suggest
rather
than
exculpate
myself
by
explanation
and
thereby
run
the
hazards
of
closing
the
slightest
avenue
by
which
a
brother
in
suffering
might
clear
himself
of
the
chains
and
fetters
of
slavery
the
practice
of
publishing
every
new
invention
by
which
a
slave
is
known
to
have
escaped
from
slavery
has
neither
wisdom
nor
necessity
to
sustain
it
had
not
henry
box
brown
and
his
friends
attracted
slaveholding
attention
to
the
manner
of
his
escape
we
might
have
had
a
thousand
per
annum
the
singularly
original
plan
adopted
by
william
and
ellen
crafts
perished
with
the
first
using
because
every
slaveholder
in
the
land
was
apprised
of
it
the
water
who
hung
in
the
guards
of
a
steamer
being
washed
three
days
and
three
nights
like
another
jonah
by
the
waves
of
the
sea
has
by
the
publicity
given
to
the
circumstance
set
a
spy
on
the
guards
of
every
steamer
departing
from
southern
ports
i
have
never
approved
of
the
very
public
manner
in
which
some
of
our
western
friends
have
conducted
what
call
the
railroad
but
which
i
think
by
their
open
declarations
has
been
made
most
emphatically
the
its
stations
are
far
better
known
to
the
slaveholders
than
to
the
slaves
i
honor
those
good
men
and
women
for
their
noble
daring
in
willingly
subjecting
themselves
to
persecution
by
openly
avowing
their
participation
in
the
escape
of
slaves
nevertheless
the
good
resulting
from
such
avowals
is
of
a
very
questionable
character
it
may
kindle
an
enthusiasm
very
pleasant
to
inhale
but
that
is
of
no
practical
benefit
to
themselves
nor
to
the
slaves
escaping
nothing
is
more
evident
than
that
such
disclosures
are
a
positive
evil
to
the
slaves
remaining
and
seeking
to
escape
in
publishing
such
accounts
the
man
addresses
the
slaveholder
the
slave
he
stimulates
the
former
to
greater
watchfulness
and
adds
to
his
facilities
for
capturing
his
slave
we
owe
something
to
the
slaves
south
of
mason
and
dixon
s
line
as
well
as
to
those
north
of
it
and
in
discharging
the
duty
of
aiding
the
latter
on
their
way
to
freedom
we
should
be
careful
to
do
nothing
which
would
be
likely
to
hinder
the
former
in
making
their
escape
from
slavery
such
is
my
detestation
of
slavery
that
i
would
keep
the
merciless
slaveholder
profoundly
ignorant
of
the
means
of
flight
adopted
by
the
slave
he
should
be
left
to
imagine
himself
surrounded
by
myriads
of
invisible
tormentors
ever
ready
to
snatch
from
his
infernal
grasp
his
trembling
prey
in
pursuing
his
victim
let
him
be
left
to
feel
his
way
in
the
dark
let
shades
of
darkness
commensurate
with
his
crime
shut
every
ray
of
light
from
his
pathway
and
let
him
be
made
to
feel
that
at
every
step
he
takes
with
the
hellish
purpose
of
reducing
a
brother
man
to
slavery
he
is
running
the
frightful
risk
of
having
his
hot
brains
dashed
out
by
an
invisible
hand
but
enough
of
this
i
will
now
proceed
to
the
statement
of
those
facts
connected
with
my
escape
for
which
i
am
alone
responsible
and
for
which
no
one
can
be
made
to
suffer
but
myself
my
condition
in
the
year
of
my
escape
was
comparatively
a
free
and
easy
one
so
far
at
least
as
the
wants
of
the
physical
man
were
concerned
but
the
reader
will
bear
in
mind
that
my
troubles
from
the
beginning
have
been
less
physical
than
mental
and
he
will
thus
be
prepared
to
find
after
what
is
narrated
in
the
previous
chapters
that
slave
life
was
adding
nothing
to
its
charms
for
me
as
i
grew
older
and
became
better
acquainted
with
it
the
practice
from
week
to
week
of
openly
robbing
me
of
all
my
earnings
kept
the
nature
and
character
of
slavery
constantly
before
me
i
could
be
robbed
by
but
this
was
open
and
barefaced
to
be
endured
i
could
see
no
reason
why
i
should
at
the
end
of
each
week
pour
the
reward
of
my
honest
toil
into
the
purse
of
any
man
the
thought
itself
vexed
me
and
the
manner
in
which
master
hugh
received
my
wages
vexed
me
more
than
the
original
wrong
carefully
counting
the
money
and
rolling
it
out
dollar
by
dollar
he
would
look
me
in
the
face
as
if
he
would
search
my
heart
as
well
as
my
pocket
and
reproachfully
ask
me
that
implying
that
i
had
perhaps
kept
back
part
of
my
wages
or
if
not
so
the
demand
was
made
possibly
to
make
me
feel
that
after
all
i
was
an
unprofitable
draining
me
of
the
last
cent
of
my
hard
earnings
he
would
however
occasionally
when
i
brought
home
an
extra
large
sum
dole
out
to
me
a
sixpence
or
a
shilling
with
a
view
perhaps
of
kindling
up
my
gratitude
but
this
practice
had
the
opposite
effect
it
was
an
admission
of
right
to
the
whole
the
fact
that
he
gave
me
any
part
of
my
wages
was
proof
that
he
suspected
that
i
had
a
right
the
whole
of
i
always
felt
uncomfortable
after
having
received
anything
in
this
way
for
i
feared
that
the
giving
me
a
few
cents
might
possibly
ease
his
conscience
and
make
him
feel
himself
a
pretty
honorable
robber
after
all
held
to
a
strict
account
and
kept
under
a
close
watch
the
old
suspicion
of
my
running
away
not
having
been
entirely
removed
escape
from
slavery
even
in
baltimore
was
very
difficult
the
railroad
from
baltimore
to
philadelphia
was
under
regulations
so
stringent
that
even
colored
travelers
were
almost
excluded
they
must
have
papers
they
must
be
measured
and
carefully
examined
before
they
were
allowed
to
enter
the
cars
they
only
went
in
the
day
time
even
when
so
examined
the
steamboats
were
under
regulations
equally
stringent
all
the
great
turnpikes
leading
northward
were
beset
with
kidnappers
a
class
of
men
who
watched
the
newspapers
for
advertisements
for
runaway
slaves
making
their
living
by
the
accursed
reward
of
slave
hunting
my
discontent
grew
upon
me
and
i
was
on
the
for
means
of
escape
with
money
i
could
easily
have
managed
the
matter
and
therefore
i
hit
upon
the
plan
of
soliciting
the
privilege
of
hiring
my
time
it
is
quite
common
in
baltimore
to
allow
slaves
this
privilege
and
it
is
the
practice
also
in
new
orleans
a
slave
who
is
considered
trustworthy
can
by
paying
his
master
a
definite
sum
regularly
at
the
end
of
each
week
dispose
of
his
time
as
he
likes
it
so
happened
that
i
was
not
in
very
good
odor
and
i
was
far
from
being
a
trustworthy
slave
nevertheless
i
watched
my
opportunity
when
master
thomas
came
to
baltimore
for
i
was
still
his
property
hugh
only
acted
as
his
agent
in
the
spring
of
to
purchase
his
spring
supply
of
goods
and
applied
to
him
directly
for
the
privilege
of
hiring
my
time
this
request
master
thomas
unhesitatingly
refused
to
grant
and
he
charged
me
with
some
sternness
with
inventing
this
stratagem
to
make
my
escape
he
told
me
i
could
go
but
he
could
catch
me
and
in
the
event
of
my
running
away
i
might
be
assured
he
should
spare
no
pains
in
his
efforts
to
recapture
he
recounted
with
a
good
deal
of
eloquence
the
many
kind
offices
he
had
done
me
and
exhorted
me
to
be
contented
and
obedient
lay
out
no
plans
for
the
future
said
he
if
you
behave
yourself
properly
i
will
take
care
of
now
kind
and
considerate
as
this
offer
was
it
failed
to
soothe
me
into
repose
in
spite
of
master
thomas
and
i
may
say
in
spite
of
myself
also
i
continued
to
think
and
worse
still
to
think
almost
exclusively
about
the
injustice
and
wickedness
of
slavery
no
effort
of
mine
or
of
his
could
silence
this
thought
or
change
my
purpose
to
run
away
about
two
months
after
applying
to
master
thomas
for
the
privilege
of
hiring
my
time
i
applied
to
master
hugh
for
the
same
liberty
supposing
him
to
be
unacquainted
with
the
fact
that
i
had
made
a
similar
application
to
master
thomas
and
had
been
refused
my
boldness
in
making
this
request
fairly
astounded
him
at
the
first
he
gazed
at
me
in
amazement
but
i
had
many
good
reasons
for
pressing
the
matter
and
after
listening
to
them
awhile
he
did
not
absolutely
refuse
but
told
me
he
would
think
of
it
here
then
was
a
gleam
of
hope
once
master
of
my
own
time
i
felt
sure
that
i
could
make
over
and
above
my
obligation
to
him
a
dollar
or
two
every
week
some
slaves
have
made
enough
in
this
way
to
purchase
their
freedom
it
is
a
sharp
spur
to
industry
and
some
of
the
most
enterprising
colored
men
in
baltimore
hire
themselves
in
this
way
after
mature
reflection
as
i
must
suppose
it
was
master
hugh
granted
me
the
privilege
in
question
on
the
following
terms
i
was
to
be
allowed
all
my
time
to
make
all
bargains
for
work
to
find
my
own
employment
and
to
collect
my
own
wages
and
in
return
for
this
liberty
i
was
required
or
obliged
to
pay
him
three
dollars
at
the
end
of
each
week
and
to
board
and
clothe
myself
and
buy
my
own
calking
tools
a
failure
in
any
of
these
particulars
would
put
an
end
to
my
privilege
this
was
a
hard
bargain
the
wear
and
tear
of
clothing
the
losing
and
breaking
of
tools
and
the
expense
of
board
made
it
necessary
for
me
to
earn
at
least
six
dollars
per
week
to
keep
even
with
the
world
all
who
are
acquainted
with
calking
know
how
uncertain
and
irregular
that
employment
is
it
can
be
done
to
advantage
only
in
dry
weather
for
it
is
useless
to
put
wet
oakum
into
a
seam
rain
or
shine
however
work
or
no
work
at
the
end
of
each
week
the
money
must
be
forthcoming
master
hugh
seemed
to
be
very
much
pleased
for
a
time
with
this
arrangement
and
well
he
might
be
for
it
was
decidedly
in
his
favor
it
relieved
him
of
all
anxiety
concerning
me
his
money
was
sure
he
had
armed
my
love
of
liberty
with
a
lash
and
a
driver
far
more
efficient
than
any
i
had
before
known
and
while
he
derived
all
the
benefits
of
slaveholding
by
the
arrangement
without
its
evils
i
endured
all
the
evils
of
being
a
slave
and
yet
suffered
all
the
care
and
anxiety
of
a
responsible
freeman
nevertheless
thought
i
it
is
a
valuable
privilege
another
step
in
my
career
toward
it
was
something
even
to
be
permitted
to
stagger
under
the
disadvantages
of
liberty
and
i
was
determined
to
hold
on
to
the
newly
gained
footing
by
all
proper
industry
i
was
ready
to
work
by
night
as
well
as
by
day
and
being
in
the
enjoyment
of
excellent
health
i
was
able
not
only
to
meet
my
current
expenses
but
also
to
lay
by
a
small
sum
at
the
end
of
each
week
all
went
on
thus
from
the
month
of
may
till
august
then
for
reasons
which
will
become
apparent
as
i
proceed
my
much
valued
liberty
was
wrested
from
me
during
the
week
previous
to
this
to
me
calamitous
event
i
had
made
arrangements
with
a
few
young
friends
to
accompany
them
on
saturday
night
to
a
held
about
twelve
miles
from
baltimore
on
the
evening
of
our
intended
start
for
the
something
occurred
in
the
ship
yard
where
i
was
at
work
which
detained
me
unusually
late
and
compelled
me
either
to
disappoint
my
young
friends
or
to
neglect
carrying
my
weekly
dues
to
master
hugh
knowing
that
i
had
the
money
and
could
hand
it
to
him
on
another
day
i
decided
to
go
to
and
to
pay
him
the
three
dollars
for
the
past
week
on
my
return
once
on
the
i
was
induced
to
remain
one
day
longer
than
i
had
intended
when
i
left
home
but
as
soon
as
i
returned
i
went
straight
to
his
house
on
fell
street
to
hand
him
his
my
money
unhappily
the
fatal
mistake
had
been
committed
i
found
him
exceedingly
angry
he
exhibited
all
the
signs
of
apprehension
and
wrath
which
a
slaveholder
may
be
surmised
to
exhibit
on
the
supposed
escape
of
a
favorite
slave
you
rascal
i
have
a
great
mind
to
give
you
a
severe
whipping
how
dare
you
go
out
of
the
city
without
first
asking
and
obtaining
my
permission
sir
said
i
i
hired
my
time
and
paid
you
the
price
you
asked
for
it
i
did
not
know
that
it
was
any
part
of
the
bargain
that
i
should
ask
you
when
or
where
i
should
you
did
not
know
you
rascal
you
are
bound
to
show
yourself
here
every
saturday
after
reflecting
a
few
moments
he
became
somewhat
cooled
down
but
evidently
greatly
troubled
he
said
now
you
scoundrel
you
have
done
for
yourself
you
shall
hire
your
time
no
longer
the
next
thing
i
shall
hear
of
will
be
your
running
away
bring
home
your
tools
and
your
clothes
at
once
i
ll
teach
you
how
to
go
off
in
this
thus
ended
my
partial
freedom
i
could
hire
my
time
no
longer
and
i
obeyed
my
master
s
orders
at
once
the
little
taste
of
liberty
which
i
had
had
although
as
the
reader
will
have
seen
it
was
far
from
being
unalloyed
by
no
means
enhanced
my
contentment
with
slavery
punished
thus
by
master
hugh
it
was
now
my
turn
to
punish
him
since
thought
i
you
make
a
slave
of
me
i
will
await
your
orders
in
all
things
and
instead
of
going
to
look
for
work
on
monday
morning
as
i
had
formerly
done
i
remained
at
home
during
the
entire
week
without
the
performance
of
a
single
stroke
of
work
saturday
night
came
and
he
called
upon
me
as
usual
for
my
wages
i
of
course
told
him
i
had
done
no
work
and
had
no
wages
here
we
were
at
the
point
of
coming
to
blows
his
wrath
had
been
accumulating
during
the
whole
week
for
he
evidently
saw
that
i
was
making
no
effort
to
get
work
but
was
most
aggravatingly
awaiting
his
orders
in
all
things
as
i
look
back
to
this
behavior
of
mine
i
scarcely
know
what
possessed
me
thus
to
trifle
with
those
who
had
such
unlimited
power
to
bless
or
to
blast
me
master
hugh
raved
and
swore
his
determination
to
get
hold
of
me
but
wisely
for
and
happily
for
his
wrath
only
employed
those
very
harmless
impalpable
missiles
which
roll
from
a
limber
tongue
in
my
desperation
i
had
fully
made
up
my
mind
to
measure
strength
with
master
hugh
in
case
he
should
undertake
to
execute
his
threats
i
am
glad
there
was
no
necessity
for
this
for
resistance
to
him
could
not
have
ended
so
happily
for
me
as
it
did
in
the
case
of
covey
he
was
not
a
man
to
be
safely
resisted
by
a
slave
and
i
freely
own
that
in
my
conduct
toward
him
in
this
instance
there
was
more
folly
than
wisdom
master
hugh
closed
his
reproofs
by
telling
me
that
hereafter
i
need
give
myself
no
uneasiness
about
getting
work
that
he
would
himself
see
to
getting
work
for
me
and
enough
of
it
at
this
threat
i
confess
had
some
terror
in
it
and
on
thinking
the
matter
over
during
the
sunday
i
resolved
not
only
to
save
him
the
trouble
of
getting
me
work
but
that
upon
the
third
day
of
september
i
would
attempt
to
make
my
escape
from
slavery
the
refusal
to
allow
me
to
hire
my
time
therefore
hastened
the
period
of
flight
i
had
three
weeks
now
in
which
to
prepare
for
my
journey
once
resolved
i
felt
a
certain
degree
of
repose
and
on
monday
instead
of
waiting
for
master
hugh
to
seek
employment
for
me
i
was
up
by
break
of
day
and
off
to
the
ship
yard
of
butler
on
the
city
block
near
the
i
was
a
favorite
with
and
young
as
i
was
i
had
served
as
his
foreman
on
the
float
stage
at
calking
of
course
i
easily
obtained
work
and
at
the
end
of
the
week
which
by
the
way
was
exceedingly
fine
i
brought
master
hugh
nearly
nine
dollars
the
effect
of
this
mark
of
returning
good
sense
on
my
part
was
excellent
he
was
very
much
pleased
he
took
the
money
commended
me
and
told
me
i
might
have
done
the
same
thing
the
week
before
it
is
a
blessed
thing
that
the
tyrant
may
not
always
know
the
thoughts
and
purposes
of
his
victim
master
hugh
little
knew
what
my
plans
were
the
going
to
without
asking
his
permission
the
insolent
answers
made
to
his
reproaches
the
sulky
deportment
the
week
after
being
deprived
of
the
privilege
of
hiring
my
time
had
awakened
in
him
the
suspicion
that
i
might
be
cherishing
disloyal
purposes
my
object
therefore
in
working
steadily
was
to
remove
suspicion
and
in
this
i
succeeded
admirably
he
probably
thought
i
was
never
better
satisfied
with
my
condition
than
at
the
very
time
i
was
planning
my
escape
the
second
week
passed
and
again
i
carried
him
my
full
week
s
wages
dollars
and
so
well
pleased
was
he
that
he
gave
me
cents
and
bade
me
make
good
use
of
it
i
told
him
i
would
for
one
of
the
uses
to
which
i
meant
to
put
it
was
to
pay
my
fare
on
the
underground
railroad
things
without
went
on
as
usual
but
i
was
passing
through
the
same
internal
excitement
and
anxiety
which
i
had
experienced
two
years
and
a
half
before
the
failure
in
that
instance
was
not
calculated
to
increase
my
confidence
in
the
success
of
this
my
second
attempt
and
i
knew
that
a
second
failure
could
not
leave
me
where
my
first
did
i
must
either
get
to
the
or
be
sent
to
the
besides
the
exercise
of
mind
from
this
state
of
facts
i
had
the
painful
sensation
of
being
about
to
separate
from
a
circle
of
honest
and
warm
hearted
friends
in
baltimore
the
thought
of
such
a
separation
where
the
hope
of
ever
meeting
again
is
excluded
and
where
there
can
be
no
correspondence
is
very
painful
it
is
my
opinion
that
thousands
would
escape
from
slavery
who
now
remain
there
but
for
the
strong
cords
of
affection
that
bind
them
to
their
families
relatives
and
friends
the
daughter
is
hindered
from
escaping
by
the
love
she
bears
her
mother
and
the
father
by
the
love
he
bears
his
children
and
so
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
i
had
no
relations
in
baltimore
and
i
saw
no
probability
of
ever
living
in
the
neighborhood
of
sisters
and
brothers
but
the
thought
of
leaving
my
friends
was
among
the
strongest
obstacles
to
my
running
away
the
last
two
days
of
the
week
friday
and
saturday
were
spent
mostly
in
collecting
my
things
together
for
my
journey
having
worked
four
days
that
week
for
my
master
i
handed
him
six
dollars
on
saturday
night
i
seldom
spent
my
sundays
at
home
and
for
fear
that
something
might
be
discovered
in
my
conduct
i
kept
up
my
custom
and
absented
myself
all
day
on
monday
the
third
day
of
september
in
accordance
with
my
resolution
i
bade
farewell
to
the
city
of
baltimore
and
to
that
slavery
which
had
been
my
abhorrence
from
childhood
how
i
got
away
in
what
direction
i
traveled
whether
by

or

or

reasons

is

driven

and
knowing
not
where
i
should
land
whether
in

or
in

it
is
proper
that
i
should
remove
at
once
all
anxiety
by
frankly
making
known
where
i
alighted
the
flight
was
a
bold
and
perilous
one
but
here
i
am
in
the
great
city
of
new
york
safe
and
sound
without
loss
of
blood
or
bone
in
less
than
a
week
after
leaving
baltimore
i
was
walking
amid
the
hurrying
throng
and
gazing
upon
the
dazzling
wonders
of
broadway
the
dreams
of
my
childhood
and
the
purposes
of
my
manhood
were
now
fulfilled
a
free
state
around
me
and
a
free
earth
under
my
feet
what
a
moment
was
this
to
me
a
whole
year
was
pressed
into
a
single
day
a
new
world
burst
upon
my
agitated
vision
i
have
often
been
asked
by
kind
friends
to
whom
i
have
told
my
story
how
i
felt
when
first
i
found
myself
beyond
the
limits
of
slavery
and
i
must
say
here
as
i
have
often
said
to
them
there
is
scarcely
anything
about
which
i
could
not
give
a
more
satisfactory
answer
it
was
a
moment
of
joyous
excitement
which
no
words
can
describe
in
a
letter
to
a
friend
written
soon
after
reaching
new
york
i
said
i
felt
as
one
might
be
supposed
to
feel
on
escaping
from
a
den
of
hungry
lions
but
in
a
moment
like
that
sensations
are
too
intense
and
too
rapid
for
words
anguish
and
grief
like
darkness
and
rain
may
be
described
but
joy
and
gladness
like
the
rainbow
of
promise
defy
alike
the
pen
and
pencil
for
ten
or
fifteen
years
i
had
been
dragging
a
heavy
chain
with
a
huge
block
attached
to
it
cumbering
my
every
motion
i
had
felt
myself
doomed
to
drag
this
chain
and
this
block
through
life
all
efforts
before
to
separate
myself
from
the
hateful
encumbrance
had
only
seemed
to
rivet
me
the
more
firmly
to
it
baffled
and
discouraged
at
times
i
had
asked
myself
the
question
may
not
this
after
all
be
god
s
work
may
he
not
for
wise
ends
have
doomed
me
to
this
lot
a
contest
had
been
going
on
in
my
mind
for
years
between
the
clear
consciousness
of
right
and
the
plausible
errors
of
superstition
between
the
wisdom
of
manly
courage
and
the
foolish
weakness
of
timidity
the
contest
was
now
ended
the
chain
was
severed
god
and
right
stood
vindicated
i
was
a
freeman
and
the
voice
of
peace
and
joy
thrilled
my
heart
free
and
joyous
however
as
i
was
joy
was
not
the
only
sensation
i
experienced
it
was
like
the
quick
blaze
beautiful
at
the
first
but
which
subsiding
leaves
the
building
charred
and
desolate
i
was
soon
taught
that
i
was
still
in
an
enemy
s
land
a
sense
of
loneliness
and
insecurity
oppressed
me
sadly
i
had
been
but
a
few
hours
in
new
york
before
i
was
met
in
the
streets
by
a
fugitive
slave
well
known
to
me
and
the
information
i
got
from
him
respecting
new
york
did
nothing
to
lessen
my
apprehension
of
danger
the
fugitive
in
question
was
allender
s
jake
in
baltimore
but
said
he
i
am
william
dixon
in
new
york
i
knew
jake
well
and
knew
when
tolly
allender
and
price
for
the
latter
employed
master
hugh
as
his
foreman
in
his
shipyard
on
fell
s
point
made
an
attempt
to
recapture
jake
and
failed
jake
told
me
all
about
his
circumstances
and
how
narrowly
he
escaped
being
taken
back
to
slavery
that
the
city
was
now
full
of
southerners
returning
from
the
springs
that
the
black
people
in
new
york
were
not
to
be
trusted
that
there
were
hired
men
on
the
lookout
for
fugitives
from
slavery
and
who
for
a
few
dollars
would
betray
me
into
the
hands
of
the
that
i
must
trust
no
man
with
my
secret
that
i
must
not
think
of
going
either
on
the
wharves
to
work
or
to
a
to
board
and
worse
still
this
same
jake
told
me
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
help
me
he
seemed
even
while
cautioning
me
to
be
fearing
lest
after
all
i
might
be
a
party
to
a
second
attempt
to
recapture
him
under
the
inspiration
of
this
thought
i
must
suppose
it
was
he
gave
signs
of
a
wish
to
get
rid
of
me
and
soon
left
me
his
whitewash
brush
in
hand
as
he
said
for
his
work
he
was
soon
lost
to
sight
among
the
throng
and
i
was
alone
again
an
easy
prey
to
the
kidnappers
if
any
should
happen
to
be
on
my
track
new
york
seventeen
years
ago
was
less
a
place
of
safety
for
a
runaway
slave
than
now
and
all
know
how
unsafe
it
now
is
under
the
new
fugitive
slave
bill
i
was
much
troubled
i
had
very
little
money
enough
to
buy
me
a
few
loaves
of
bread
but
not
enough
to
pay
board
outside
a
lumber
yard
i
saw
the
wisdom
of
keeping
away
from
the
ship
yards
for
if
master
hugh
pursued
me
he
would
naturally
expect
to
find
me
looking
for
work
among
the
calkers
for
a
time
every
door
seemed
closed
against
me
a
sense
of
my
loneliness
and
helplessness
crept
over
me
and
covered
me
with
something
bordering
on
despair
in
the
midst
of
thousands
of
my
fellowmen
and
yet
a
perfect
stranger
in
the
midst
of
human
brothers
and
yet
more
fearful
of
them
than
of
hungry
wolves
i
was
without
home
without
friends
without
work
without
money
and
without
any
definite
knowledge
of
which
way
to
go
or
where
to
look
for
succor
some
apology
can
easily
be
made
for
the
few
slaves
who
have
after
making
good
their
escape
turned
back
to
slavery
preferring
the
actual
rule
of
their
masters
to
the
life
of
loneliness
apprehension
hunger
and
anxiety
which
meets
them
on
their
first
arrival
in
a
free
state
it
is
difficult
for
a
freeman
to
enter
into
the
feelings
of
such
fugitives
he
can
not
see
things
in
the
same
light
with
the
slave
because
he
does
not
and
can
not
look
from
the
same
point
from
which
the
slave
does
why
do
you
tremble
he
says
to
the
slave
you
are
in
a
free
state
but
the
difficulty
is
in
realizing
that
he
is
in
a
free
state
the
slave
might
reply
a
freeman
can
not
understand
why
the
s
shadow
is
bigger
to
the
slave
than
the
might
and
majesty
of
a
free
state
but
when
he
reflects
that
the
slave
knows
more
about
the
slavery
of
his
master
than
he
does
of
the
might
and
majesty
of
the
free
state
he
has
the
explanation
the
slave
has
been
all
his
life
learning
the
power
of
his
master
being
trained
to
dread
his
approach
and
only
a
few
hours
learning
the
power
of
the
state
the
master
is
to
him
a
stern
and
flinty
reality
but
the
state
is
little
more
than
a
dream
he
has
been
accustomed
to
regard
every
white
man
as
the
friend
of
his
master
and
every
colored
man
as
more
or
less
under
the
control
of
his
master
s
friends
the
white
people
it
takes
stout
nerves
to
stand
up
in
such
circumstances
a
man
homeless
shelterless
breadless
friendless
and
moneyless
is
not
in
a
condition
to
assume
a
very
proud
or
joyous
tone
and
in
just
this
condition
was
i
while
wandering
about
the
streets
of
new
york
city
and
lodging
at
least
one
night
among
the
barrels
on
one
of
its
wharves
i
was
not
only
free
from
slavery
but
i
was
free
from
home
as
well
the
reader
will
easily
see
that
i
had
something
more
than
the
simple
fact
of
being
free
to
think
of
in
this
extremity
i
kept
my
secret
as
long
as
i
could
and
at
last
was
forced
to
go
in
search
of
an
honest
man
a
man
sufficiently
not
to
betray
me
into
the
hands
of
i
was
not
a
bad
reader
of
the
human
face
nor
long
in
selecting
the
right
man
when
once
compelled
to
disclose
the
facts
of
my
condition
to
some
one
i
found
my
man
in
the
person
of
one
who
said
his
name
was
stewart
he
was
a
sailor
and
generous
and
he
listened
to
my
story
with
a
brother
s
interest
i
told
him
i
was
running
for
my
freedom
knew
not
where
to
go
money
almost
gone
was
hungry
thought
it
unsafe
to
go
the
shipyards
for
work
and
needed
a
friend
stewart
promptly
put
me
in
the
way
of
getting
out
of
my
trouble
he
took
me
to
his
house
and
went
in
search
of
the
late
david
ruggles
who
was
then
the
secretary
of
the
new
york
vigilance
committee
and
a
very
active
man
in
all
works
once
in
the
hands
of
ruggles
i
was
comparatively
safe
i
was
hidden
with
ruggles
several
days
in
the
meantime
my
intended
wife
anna
came
on
from
baltimore
to
whom
i
had
written
informing
her
of
my
safe
arrival
at
new
york
and
in
the
presence
of
mitchell
and
ruggles
we
were
married
by
rev
james
pennington
ruggles
was
the
first
officer
on
the
railroad
with
whom
i
met
after
reaching
the
north
and
indeed
the
first
of
whom
i
ever
heard
anything
learning
that
i
was
a
calker
by
trade
he
promptly
decided
that
new
bedford
was
the
proper
place
to
send
me
many
ships
said
he
are
there
fitted
out
for
the
whaling
business
and
you
may
there
find
work
at
your
trade
and
make
a
good
thus
in
one
fortnight
after
my
flight
from
maryland
i
was
safe
in
new
bedford
regularly
entered
upon
the
exercise
of
the
rights
responsibilities
and
duties
of
a
freeman
i
may
mention
a
little
circumstance
which
annoyed
me
on
reaching
new
bedford
i
had
not
a
cent
of
money
and
lacked
two
dollars
toward
paying
our
fare
from
newport
and
our
baggage
not
very
costly
was
taken
by
the
stage
driver
and
held
until
i
could
raise
the
money
to
redeem
it
this
difficulty
was
soon
surmounted
nathan
johnson
to
whom
we
had
a
line
from
ruggles
not
only
received
us
kindly
and
hospitably
but
on
being
informed
about
our
baggage
promptly
loaned
me
two
dollars
with
which
to
redeem
my
little
property
i
shall
ever
be
deeply
grateful
both
to
and
nathan
johnson
for
the
lively
interest
they
were
pleased
to
take
in
me
in
this
hour
of
my
extremest
need
they
not
only
gave
myself
and
wife
bread
and
shelter
but
taught
us
how
to
begin
to
secure
those
benefits
for
ourselves
long
may
they
live
and
may
blessings
attend
them
in
this
life
and
in
that
which
is
to
come
once
initiated
into
the
new
life
of
freedom
and
assured
by
johnson
that
new
bedford
was
a
safe
place
the
comparatively
unimportant
matter
as
to
what
should
be
my
name
came
up
for
considertion
sic
it
was
necessary
to
have
a
name
in
my
new
relations
the
name
given
me
by
my
beloved
mother
was
no
less
pretentious
than
frederick
augustus
washington
i
had
however
before
leaving
maryland
dispensed
with
the
and
retained
the
name
between
baltimore
and
new
bedford
however
i
had
several
different
names
the
better
to
avoid
being
overhauled
by
the
hunters
which
i
had
good
reason
to
believe
would
be
put
on
my
track
among
honest
men
an
honest
man
may
well
be
content
with
one
name
and
to
acknowledge
it
at
all
times
and
in
all
places
but
toward
fugitives
americans
are
not
honest
when
i
arrived
at
new
bedford
my
name
was
johnson
and
finding
that
the
johnson
family
in
new
bedford
were
already
quite
numerous
sufficiently
so
to
produce
some
confusion
in
attempts
to
distinguish
one
from
another
there
was
the
more
reason
for
making
another
change
in
my
name
in
fact
johnson
had
been
assumed
by
nearly
every
slave
who
had
arrived
in
new
bedford
from
maryland
and
this
much
to
the
annoyance
of
the
original
johnsons
of
whom
there
were
many
in
that
place
mine
host
unwilling
to
have
another
of
his
own
name
added
to
the
community
in
this
unauthorized
way
after
i
spent
a
night
and
a
day
at
his
house
gave
me
my
present
name
he
had
been
reading
the
lady
of
the
lake
and
was
pleased
to
regard
me
as
a
suitable
person
to
wear
this
one
of
scotland
s
many
famous
names
considering
the
noble
hospitality
and
manly
character
of
nathan
johnson
i
have
felt
that
he
better
than
i
illustrated
the
virtues
of
the
great
scottish
chief
sure
i
am
that
had
any
entered
his
domicile
with
a
view
to
molest
any
one
of
his
household
he
would
have
shown
himself
like
him
of
the
stalwart
the
reader
will
be
amused
at
my
ignorance
when
i
tell
the
notions
i
had
of
the
state
of
northern
wealth
enterprise
and
civilization
of
wealth
and
refinement
i
supposed
the
north
had
none
my
which
was
almost
my
only
book
had
not
done
much
to
enlighten
me
concerning
northern
society
the
impressions
i
had
received
were
all
wide
of
the
truth
new
bedford
especially
took
me
by
surprise
in
the
solid
wealth
and
grandeur
there
exhibited
i
had
formed
my
notions
respecting
the
social
condition
of
the
free
states
by
what
i
had
seen
and
known
of
free
white
people
in
the
slave
states
regarding
slavery
as
the
basis
of
wealth
i
fancied
that
no
people
could
become
very
wealthy
without
slavery
a
free
white
man
holding
no
slaves
in
the
country
i
had
known
to
be
the
most
ignorant
and
of
men
and
the
laugh
ing
stock
even
of
slaves
themselves
called
generally
by
them
in
derision
poor
white
like
the
at
the
south
in
holding
no
slaves
i
suppose
the
northern
people
like
them
also
in
poverty
and
degradation
judge
then
of
my
amazement
and
joy
when
i
found
as
i
did
find
the
very
laboring
population
of
new
bedford
living
in
better
houses
more
elegantly
furnished
surrounded
by
more
comfort
and
refinement
than
a
majority
of
the
slaveholders
on
the
eastern
shore
of
maryland
there
was
my
friend
johnson
himself
a
colored
man
who
at
the
south
would
have
been
regarded
as
a
proper
marketable
commodity
who
lived
in
a
better
house
dined
at
a
richer
board
was
the
owner
of
more
books
the
reader
of
more
newspapers
was
more
conversant
with
the
political
and
social
condition
of
this
nation
and
the
world
than
of
all
the
slaveholders
of
talbot
county
maryland
yet
johnson
was
a
working
man
and
his
hands
were
hardened
by
honest
toil
here
then
was
something
for
observation
and
study
whence
the
difference
the
explanation
was
soon
furnished
in
the
superiority
of
mind
over
simple
brute
force
many
pages
might
be
given
to
the
contrast
and
in
explanation
of
its
causes
but
an
incident
or
two
will
suffice
to
show
the
reader
as
to
how
the
mystery
gradually
vanished
before
me
my
first
afternoon
on
reaching
new
bedford
was
spent
in
visiting
the
wharves
and
viewing
the
shipping
the
sight
of
the
broad
brim
and
the
plain
quaker
dress
which
met
me
at
every
turn
greatly
increased
my
sense
of
freedom
and
security
i
am
among
the
quakers
thought
i
and
am
lying
at
the
wharves
and
riding
in
the
stream
were
ships
of
finest
model
ready
to
start
on
whaling
voyages
upon
the
right
and
the
left
i
was
walled
in
by
large
warehouses
crowded
with
the
good
things
of
this
world
on
the
wharves
i
saw
industry
without
bustle
labor
without
noise
and
heavy
toil
without
the
whip
there
was
no
loud
singing
as
in
southern
ports
where
ships
are
loading
or
unloading
no
loud
cursing
or
swearing
but
everything
went
on
as
smoothly
as
the
works
of
a
well
adjusted
machine
how
different
was
all
this
from
the
nosily
fierce
and
clumsily
absurd
manner
of
in
baltimore
and
michael
s
one
of
the
first
incidents
which
illustrated
the
superior
mental
character
of
northern
labor
over
that
of
the
south
was
the
manner
of
unloading
a
ship
s
cargo
of
oil
in
a
southern
port
twenty
or
thirty
hands
would
have
been
employed
to
do
what
five
or
six
did
here
with
the
aid
of
a
single
ox
attached
to
the
end
of
a
fall
main
strength
unassisted
by
skill
is
slavery
s
method
of
labor
an
old
ox
worth
eighty
dollars
was
doing
in
new
bedford
what
would
have
required
fifteen
thousand
dollars
worth
of
human
bones
and
muscles
to
have
performed
in
a
southern
port
i
found
that
everything
was
done
here
with
a
scrupulous
regard
to
economy
both
in
regard
to
men
and
things
time
and
strength
the
maid
servant
instead
of
spending
at
least
a
tenth
part
of
her
time
in
bringing
and
carrying
water
as
in
baltimore
had
the
pump
at
her
elbow
the
wood
was
dry
and
snugly
piled
away
for
winter
woodhouses
pumps
sinks
drains
gates
washing
machines
pounding
barrels
were
all
new
things
and
told
me
that
i
was
among
a
thoughtful
and
sensible
people
to
the
dock
i
went
and
saw
the
same
wise
prudence
the
carpenters
struck
where
they
aimed
and
the
calkers
wasted
no
blows
in
idle
flourishes
of
the
mallet
i
learned
that
men
went
from
new
bedford
to
baltimore
and
bought
old
ships
and
brought
them
here
to
repair
and
made
them
better
and
more
valuable
than
they
ever
were
before
men
talked
here
of
going
whaling
on
a
four
voyage
with
more
coolness
than
sailors
where
i
came
from
talked
of
going
a
four
voyage
i
now
find
that
i
could
have
landed
in
no
part
of
the
united
states
where
i
should
have
found
a
more
striking
and
gratifying
contrast
to
the
condition
of
the
free
people
of
color
in
baltimore
than
i
found
here
in
new
bedford
no
colored
man
is
really
free
in
a
slaveholding
state
he
wears
the
badge
of
bondage
while
nominally
free
and
is
often
subjected
to
hardships
to
which
the
slave
is
a
stranger
but
here
in
new
bedford
it
was
my
good
fortune
to
see
a
pretty
near
approach
to
freedom
on
the
part
of
the
colored
people
i
was
taken
all
aback
when
johnson
who
lost
no
time
in
making
me
acquainted
with
the
fact
told
me
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
constitution
of
massachusetts
to
prevent
a
colored
man
from
holding
any
office
in
the
state
there
in
new
bedford
the
black
man
s
children
although
was
then
far
from
popular
went
to
school
side
by
side
with
the
white
children
and
apparently
without
objection
from
any
quarter
to
make
me
at
home
johnson
assured
me
that
no
slaveholder
could
take
a
slave
from
new
bedford
that
there
were
men
there
who
would
lay
down
their
lives
before
such
an
outrage
could
be
perpetrated
the
colored
people
themselves
were
of
the
best
metal
and
would
fight
for
liberty
to
the
death
soon
after
my
arrival
in
new
bedford
i
was
told
the
following
story
which
was
said
to
illustrate
the
spirit
of
the
colored
people
in
that
goodly
town
a
colored
man
and
a
fugitive
slave
happened
to
have
a
little
quarrel
and
the
former
was
heard
to
threaten
the
latter
with
informing
his
master
of
his
whereabouts
as
soon
as
this
threat
became
known
a
notice
was
read
from
the
desk
of
what
was
then
the
only
colored
church
in
the
place
stating
that
business
of
importance
was
to
be
then
and
there
transacted
special
measures
had
been
taken
to
secure
the
attendance
of
the
judas
and
had
proved
successful
accordingly
at
the
hour
appointed
the
people
came
and
the
betrayer
also
all
the
usual
formalities
of
public
meetings
were
scrupulously
gone
through
even
to
the
offering
prayer
for
divine
direction
in
the
duties
of
the
occasion
the
president
himself
performed
this
part
of
the
ceremony
and
i
was
told
that
he
was
unusually
fervent
yet
at
the
close
of
his
prayer
the
old
man
one
of
the
numerous
family
of
johnsons
rose
from
his
knees
deliberately
surveyed
his
audience
and
then
said
in
a
tone
of
solemn
resolution
well
friends
we
have
got
him
here
and
i
would
that
you
young
men
should
just
take
him
outside
the
door
and
kill
with
this
a
large
body
of
the
congregation
who
well
understood
the
business
they
had
come
there
to
transact
made
a
rush
at
the
villain
and
doubtless
would
have
killed
him
had
he
not
availed
himself
of
an
open
sash
and
made
good
his
escape
he
has
never
shown
his
head
in
new
bedford
since
that
time
this
little
incident
is
perfectly
characteristic
of
the
spirit
of
the
colored
people
in
new
bedford
a
slave
could
not
be
taken
from
that
town
seventeen
years
ago
any
more
than
he
could
be
so
taken
away
now
the
reason
is
that
the
colored
people
in
that
city
are
educated
up
to
the
point
of
fighting
for
their
freedom
as
well
as
speaking
for
it
once
assured
of
my
safety
in
new
bedford
i
put
on
the
habiliments
of
a
common
laborer
and
went
on
the
wharf
in
search
of
work
i
had
no
notion
of
living
on
the
honest
and
generous
sympathy
of
my
colored
brother
johnson
or
that
of
the
abolitionists
my
cry
was
like
that
of
hood
s
laborer
oh
only
give
me
happily
for
me
i
was
not
long
in
searching
i
found
employment
the
third
day
after
my
arrival
in
new
bedford
in
stowing
a
sloop
with
a
load
of
oil
for
the
new
york
market
it
was
new
hard
and
dirty
work
even
for
a
calker
but
i
went
at
it
with
a
glad
heart
and
a
willing
hand
i
was
now
my
own
master
a
tremendous
fact
and
the
rapturous
excitement
with
which
i
seized
the
job
may
not
easily
be
understood
except
by
some
one
with
an
experience
like
mine
the
thoughts
i
can
work
i
can
work
for
a
living
i
am
not
afraid
of
work
i
have
no
master
hugh
to
rob
me
of
my
earnings
placed
me
in
a
state
of
independence
beyond
seeking
friendship
or
support
of
any
man
that
day
s
work
i
considered
the
real
starting
point
of
something
like
a
new
existence
having
finished
this
job
and
got
my
pay
for
the
same
i
went
next
in
pursuit
of
a
job
at
calking
it
so
happened
that
rodney
french
late
mayor
of
the
city
of
new
bedford
had
a
ship
fitting
out
for
sea
and
to
which
there
was
a
large
job
of
calking
and
coppering
to
be
done
i
applied
to
that
noblehearted
man
for
employment
and
he
promptly
told
me
to
go
to
work
but
going
on
the
for
the
purpose
i
was
informed
that
every
white
man
would
leave
the
ship
if
i
struck
a
blow
upon
her
well
well
thought
i
this
is
a
hardship
but
yet
not
a
very
serious
one
for
the
difference
between
the
wages
of
a
calker
and
that
of
a
common
day
laborer
was
an
hundred
per
cent
in
favor
of
the
former
but
then
i
was
free
and
free
to
work
though
not
at
my
trade
i
now
prepared
myself
to
do
anything
which
came
to
hand
in
the
way
of
turning
an
honest
penny
sawed
wood
dug
cellars
shoveled
coal
swept
chimneys
with
uncle
lucas
debuty
rolled
oil
casks
on
the
wharves
helped
to
load
and
unload
vessels
worked
in
ricketson
s
candle
works
in
richmond
s
brass
foundery
and
elsewhere
and
thus
supported
myself
and
family
for
three
years
the
first
winter
was
unusually
severe
in
consequence
of
the
high
prices
of
food
but
even
during
that
winter
we
probably
suffered
less
than
many
who
had
been
free
all
their
lives
during
the
hardest
of
the
winter
i
hired
out
for
nine
dolars
sic
a
month
and
out
of
this
rented
two
rooms
for
nine
dollars
per
quarter
and
supplied
my
wife
who
was
unable
to
work
with
food
and
some
necessary
articles
of
furniture
we
were
closely
pinched
to
bring
our
wants
within
our
means
but
the
jail
stood
over
the
way
and
i
had
a
wholesome
dread
of
the
consequences
of
running
in
debt
this
winter
past
and
i
was
up
with
the
times
got
plenty
of
work
got
well
paid
for
it
and
felt
that
i
had
not
done
a
foolish
thing
to
leave
master
hugh
and
master
thomas
i
was
now
living
in
a
new
world
and
was
wide
awake
to
its
advantages
i
early
began
to
attend
the
meetings
of
the
colored
people
of
new
bedford
and
to
take
part
in
them
i
was
somewhat
amazed
to
see
colored
men
drawing
up
resolutions
and
offering
them
for
consideration
several
colored
young
men
of
new
bedford
at
that
period
gave
promise
of
great
usefulness
they
were
educated
and
possessed
what
seemed
to
me
at
the
time
very
superior
talents
some
of
them
have
been
cut
down
by
death
and
others
have
removed
to
different
parts
of
the
world
and
some
remain
there
now
and
justify
in
their
present
activities
my
early
impressions
of
them
among
my
first
concerns
on
reaching
new
bedford
was
to
become
united
with
the
church
for
i
had
never
given
up
in
reality
my
religious
faith
i
had
become
lukewarm
and
in
a
backslidden
state
but
i
was
still
convinced
that
it
was
my
duty
to
join
the
methodist
church
i
was
not
then
aware
of
the
powerful
influence
of
that
religious
body
in
favor
of
the
enslavement
of
my
race
nor
did
i
see
how
the
northern
churches
could
be
responsible
for
the
conduct
of
southern
churches
neither
did
i
fully
understand
how
it
could
be
my
duty
to
remain
separate
from
the
church
because
bad
men
were
connected
with
it
the
slaveholding
church
with
its
coveys
weedens
aulds
and
hopkins
i
could
see
through
at
once
but
i
could
not
see
how
elm
street
church
in
new
bedford
could
be
regarded
as
sanctioning
the
christianity
of
these
characters
in
the
church
at
michael
s
i
therefore
resolved
to
join
the
methodist
church
in
new
bedford
and
to
enjoy
the
spiritual
advantage
of
public
worship
the
minister
of
the
elm
street
methodist
church
was
the
rev
bonney
and
although
i
was
not
allowed
a
seat
in
the
body
of
the
house
and
was
proscribed
on
account
of
my
color
regarding
this
proscription
simply
as
an
accommodation
of
the
uncoverted
congregation
who
had
not
yet
been
won
to
christ
and
his
brotherhood
i
was
willing
thus
to
be
proscribed
lest
sinners
should
be
driven
away
form
the
saving
power
of
the
gospel
once
converted
i
thought
they
would
be
sure
to
treat
me
as
a
man
and
a
brother
surely
thought
i
these
christian
people
have
none
of
this
feeling
against
color
they
at
least
have
renounced
this
unholy
judge
then
dear
reader
of
my
astonishment
and
mortification
when
i
found
as
soon
i
did
find
all
my
charitable
assumptions
at
fault
an
opportunity
was
soon
afforded
me
for
ascertaining
the
exact
position
of
elm
street
church
on
that
subject
i
had
a
chance
of
seeing
the
religious
part
of
the
congregation
by
themselves
and
although
they
disowned
in
effect
their
black
brothers
and
sisters
before
the
world
i
did
think
that
where
none
but
the
saints
were
assembled
and
no
offense
could
be
given
to
the
wicked
and
the
gospel
could
not
be
blamed
they
would
certainly
recognize
us
as
children
of
the
same
father
and
heirs
of
the
same
salvation
on
equal
terms
with
themselves
the
occasion
to
which
i
refer
was
the
sacrament
of
the
lord
s
supper
that
most
sacred
and
most
solemn
of
all
the
ordinances
of
the
christian
church
bonney
had
preached
a
very
solemn
and
searching
discourse
which
really
proved
him
to
be
acquainted
with
the
inmost
secerts
sic
of
the
human
heart
at
the
close
of
his
discourse
the
congregation
was
dismissed
and
the
church
remained
to
partake
of
the
sacrament
i
remained
to
see
as
i
thought
this
holy
sacrament
celebrated
in
the
spirit
of
its
great
founder
there
were
only
about
a
half
dozen
colored
members
attached
to
the
elm
street
church
at
this
time
after
the
congregation
was
dismissed
these
descended
from
the
gallery
and
took
a
seat
against
the
wall
most
distant
from
the
altar
brother
bonney
was
very
animated
and
sung
very
sweetly
salvation
tis
a
joyful
sound
and
soon
began
to
administer
the
sacrament
i
was
anxious
to
observe
the
bearing
of
the
colored
members
and
the
result
was
most
humiliating
during
the
whole
ceremony
they
looked
like
sheep
without
a
shepherd
the
white
members
went
forward
to
the
altar
by
the
bench
full
and
when
it
was
evident
that
all
the
whites
had
been
served
with
the
bread
and
wine
brother
bonney
pious
brother
bonney
after
a
long
pause
as
if
inquiring
whether
all
the
whites
members
had
been
served
and
fully
assuring
himself
on
that
important
point
then
raised
his
voice
to
an
unnatural
pitch
and
looking
to
the
corner
where
his
black
sheep
seemed
penned
beckoned
with
his
hand
exclaiming
come
forward
colored
friends
come
forward
you
too
have
an
interest
in
the
blood
of
christ
god
is
no
respecter
of
persons
come
forward
and
take
this
holy
sacrament
to
your
the
colored
members
poor
slavish
souls
went
forward
as
invited
i
went
out
and
have
never
been
in
that
church
since
although
i
honestly
went
there
with
a
view
to
joining
that
body
i
found
it
impossible
to
respect
the
religious
profession
of
any
who
were
under
the
dominion
of
this
wicked
prejudice
and
i
could
not
therefore
feel
that
in
joining
them
i
was
joining
a
christian
church
at
all
i
tried
other
churches
in
new
bedford
with
the
same
result
and
finally
i
attached
myself
to
a
small
body
of
colored
methodists
known
as
the
zion
methodists
favored
with
the
affection
and
confidence
of
the
members
of
this
humble
communion
i
was
soon
made
a
classleader
and
a
local
preacher
among
them
many
seasons
of
peace
and
joy
i
experienced
among
them
the
remembrance
of
which
is
still
precious
although
i
could
not
see
it
to
be
my
duty
to
remain
with
that
body
when
i
found
that
it
consented
to
the
same
spirit
which
held
my
brethren
in
chains
in
four
or
five
months
after
reaching
new
bedford
there
came
a
young
man
to
me
with
a
copy
of
the
the
paper
edited
by
william
lloyd
garrison
and
published
by
isaac
knapp
and
asked
me
to
subscribe
for
it
i
told
him
i
had
but
just
escaped
from
slavery
and
was
of
course
very
poor
and
remarked
further
that
i
was
unable
to
pay
for
it
then
the
agent
however
very
willingly
took
me
as
a
subscriber
and
appeared
to
be
much
pleased
with
securing
my
name
to
his
list
from
this
time
i
was
brought
in
contact
with
the
mind
of
william
lloyd
garrison
his
paper
took
its
place
with
me
next
to
the
bible
the
was
a
paper
after
my
own
heart
it
detested
slavery
exposed
hypocrisy
and
wickedness
in
high
places
made
no
truce
with
the
traffickers
in
the
bodies
and
souls
of
men
it
preached
human
brotherhood
denounced
oppression
and
with
all
the
solemnity
of
god
s
word
demanded
the
complete
emancipation
of
my
race
i
not
only
liked
i
this
paper
and
its
editor
he
seemed
a
match
for
all
the
oponents
sic
of
emancipation
whether
they
spoke
in
the
name
of
the
law
or
the
gospel
his
words
were
few
full
of
holy
fire
and
straight
to
the
point
learning
to
love
him
through
his
paper
i
was
prepared
to
be
pleased
with
his
presence
something
of
a
hero
worshiper
by
nature
here
was
one
on
first
sight
to
excite
my
love
and
reverence
seventeen
years
ago
few
men
possessed
a
more
heavenly
countenance
than
william
lloyd
garrison
and
few
men
evinced
a
more
genuine
or
a
more
exalted
piety
the
bible
was
his
text
book
held
sacred
as
the
word
of
the
eternal
father
sinless
perfection
complete
submission
to
insults
and
injuries
literal
obedience
to
the
injunction
if
smitten
on
one
side
to
turn
the
other
also
not
only
was
sunday
a
sabbath
but
all
days
were
sabbaths
and
to
be
kept
holy
all
sectarism
false
and
mischievous
the
regenerated

the
world
members
of

body
and
the
head
christ
jesus
prejudice
against
color
was
rebellion
against
god
of
all
men
beneath
the
sky
the
slaves
because
most
neglected
and
despised
were
nearest
and
dearest
to
his
great
heart
those
ministers
who
defended
slavery
from
the
bible
were
of
their
father
the
devil
and
those
churches
which
fellowshiped
slaveholders
as
christians
were
synagogues
of
satan
and
our
nation
was
a
nation
of
liars
never
loud
or
noisy
calm
and
serene
as
a
summer
sky
and
as
pure
you
are
the
man
the
moses
raised
up
by
god
to
deliver
his
modern
israel
from
bondage
was
the
spontaneous
feeling
of
my
heart
as
i
sat
away
back
in
the
hall
and
listened
to
his
mighty
words
mighty
in
truth
mighty
in
their
simple
earnestness
i
had
not
long
been
a
reader
of
the
and
listener
to
its
editor
before
i
got
a
clear
apprehension
of
the
principles
of
the
movement
i
had
already
the
spirit
of
the
movement
and
only
needed
to
understand
its
principles
and
measures
these
i
got
from
the
and
from
those
who
believed
in
that
paper
my
acquaintance
with
the
movement
increased
my
hope
for
the
ultimate
freedom
of
my
race
and
i
united
with
it
from
a
sense
of
delight
as
well
as
duty
every
week
the
came
and
every
week
i
made
myself
master
of
its
contents
all
the
meetings
held
in
new
bedford
i
promptly
attended
my
heart
burning
at
every
true
utterance
against
the
slave
system
and
every
rebuke
of
its
friends
and
supporters
thus
passed
the
first
three
years
of
my
residence
in
new
bedford
i
had
not
then
dreamed
of
the
posibility
sic
of
my
becoming
a
public
advocate
of
the
cause
so
deeply
imbedded
in
my
heart
it
was
enough
for
me
to
listen
to
receive
and
applaud
the
great
words
of
others
and
only
whisper
in
private
among
the
white
laborers
on
the
wharves
and
elsewhere
the
truths
which
burned
in
my
breast
chapter

a
brand
new

of
my

not

the
programme

to
settle
all
doubt
i
write
my
experience
of
slavery
danger
of
recapture
increased
in
the
summer
of
a
grand
convention
was
held
in
nantucket
under
the
auspices
of
garrison
and
his
friends
until
now
i
had
taken
no
holiday
since
my
escape
from
slavery
having
worked
very
hard
that
spring
and
summer
in
richmond
s
brass
foundery
sometimes
working
all
night
as
well
as
all
day
and
needing
a
day
or
two
of
rest
i
attended
this
convention
never
supposing
that
i
should
take
part
in
the
proceedings
indeed
i
was
not
aware
that
any
one
connected
with
the
convention
even
so
much
as
knew
my
name
i
was
however
quite
mistaken
william
coffin
a
prominent
abolitionst
sic
in
those
days
of
trial
had
heard
me
speaking
to
my
colored
friends
in
the
little
school
house
on
second
street
new
bedford
where
we
worshiped
he
sought
me
out
in
the
crowd
and
invited
me
to
say
a
few
words
to
the
convention
thus
sought
out
and
thus
invited
i
was
induced
to
speak
out
the
feelings
inspired
by
the
occasion
and
the
fresh
recollection
of
the
scenes
through
which
i
had
passed
as
a
slave
my
speech
on
this
occasion
is
about
the
only
one
i
ever
made
of
which
i
do
not
remember
a
single
connected
sentence
it
was
extraordinary
speech
of
garrison
with
the
utmost
difficulty
that
i
could
stand
erect
or
that
i
could
command
and
articulate
two
words
without
hesitation
and
stammering
i
trembled
in
every
limb
i
am
not
sure
that
my
embarrassment
was
not
the
most
effective
part
of
my
speech
if
speech
it
could
be
called
at
any
rate
this
is
about
the
only
part
of
my
performance
that
i
now
distinctly
remember
but
excited
and
convulsed
as
i
was
the
audience
though
remarkably
quiet
before
became
as
much
excited
as
myself
garrison
followed
me
taking
me
as
his
text
and
now
whether
i
had
made
an
eloquent
speech
in
behalf
of
freedom
or
not
his
was
one
never
to
be
forgotten
by
those
who
heard
it
those
who
had
heard
garrison
oftenest
and
had
known
him
longest
were
astonished
it
was
an
effort
of
unequaled
power
sweeping
down
like
a
very
tornado
every
opposing
barrier
whether
of
sentiment
or
opinion
for
a
moment
he
possessed
that
almost
fabulous
inspiration
often
referred
to
but
seldom
attained
in
which
a
public
meeting
is
transformed
as
it
were
into
a
single
individuality
the
orator
wielding
a
thousand
heads
and
hearts
at
once
and
by
the
simple
majesty
of
his
all
controlling
thought
converting
his
hearers
into
the
express
image
of
his
own
soul
that
night
there
were
at
least
one
thousand
garrisonians
in
nantucket
a
sic
the
close
of
this
great
meeting
i
was
duly
waited
on
by
john
collins
then
the
general
agent
of
the
massachusetts
society
and
urgently
solicited
by
him
to
become
an
agent
of
that
society
and
to
publicly
advocate
its
principles
i
was
reluctant
to
take
the
proffered
position
i
had
not
been
quite
three
years
from
slavery
was
honestly
distrustful
of
my
ability
wished
to
be
excused
publicity
exposed
me
to
discovery
and
arrest
by
my
master
and
other
objections
came
up
but
collins
was
not
to
be
put
off
and
i
finally
consented
to
go
out
for
three
months
for
i
supposed
that
i
should
have
got
to
the
end
of
my
story
and
my
usefulness
in
that
length
of
time
here
opened
upon
me
a
new
life
a
life
for
which
i
had
had
no
preparation
i
was
a
graduate
from
the
peculiar
institution
oath
of
white
witnesses
collins
used
to
say
when
introducing
me
with
my
diploma
written
on
my
back
the
three
years
of
my
freedom
had
been
spent
in
the
hard
school
of
adversity
my
hands
had
been
furnished
by
nature
with
something
like
a
solid
leather
coating
and
i
had
bravely
marked
out
for
myself
a
life
of
rough
labor
suited
to
the
hardness
of
my
hands
as
a
means
of
supporting
myself
and
rearing
my
children
now
what
shall
i
say
of
this
fourteen
years
experience
as
a
public
advocate
of
the
cause
of
my
enslaved
brothers
and
sisters
the
time
is
but
as
a
speck
yet
large
enough
to
justify
a
pause
for
retrospection
and
a
pause
it
must
only
be
young
ardent
and
hopeful
i
entered
upon
this
new
life
in
the
full
gush
of
unsuspecting
enthusiasm
the
cause
was
good
the
men
engaged
in
it
were
good
the
means
to
attain
its
triumph
good
heaven
s
blessing
must
attend
all
and
freedom
must
soon
be
given
to
the
pining
millions
under
a
ruthless
bondage
my
whole
heart
went
with
the
holy
cause
and
my
most
fervent
prayer
to
the
almighty
disposer
of
the
hearts
of
men
were
continually
offered
for
its
early
triumph
who
or
what
thought
i
can
withstand
a
cause
so
good
so
holy
so
indescribably
glorious
the
god
of
israel
is
with
us
the
might
of
the
eternal
is
on
our
side
now
let
but
the
truth
be
spoken
and
a
nation
will
start
forth
at
the
sound
in
this
enthusiastic
spirit
i
dropped
into
the
ranks
of
freedom
s
friends
and
went
forth
to
the
battle
for
a
time
i
was
made
to
forget
that
my
skin
was
dark
and
my
hair
crisped
for
a
time
i
regretted
that
i
could
not
have
shared
the
hardships
and
dangers
endured
by
the
earlier
workers
for
the
slave
s
release
i
soon
however
found
that
my
enthusiasm
had
been
extravagant
that
hardships
and
dangers
were
not
yet
passed
and
that
the
life
now
before
me
had
shadows
as
well
as
sunbeams
among
the
first
duties
assigned
me
on
entering
the
ranks
was
to
travel
in
company
with
george
foster
to
secure
subscribers
to
the
and
the
with
matter
of
the
speech
him
i
traveled
and
lectured
through
the
eastern
counties
of
massachusetts
much
interest
was
awakened
large
meetings
assembled
many
came
no
doubt
from
curiosity
to
hear
what
a
negro
could
say
in
his
own
cause
i
was
generally
introduced
as
a
chattel
thing
a
piece
of
southern
property
the
chairman
assuring
the
audience
that
could
speak
fugitive
slaves
at
that
time
were
not
so
plentiful
as
now
and
as
a
fugitive
slave
lecturer
i
had
the
advantage
of
being
a
brand
new
fact
the
first
one
out
up
to
that
time
a
colored
man
was
deemed
a
fool
who
confessed
himself
a
runaway
slave
not
only
because
of
the
danger
to
which
he
exposed
himself
of
being
retaken
but
because
it
was
a
confession
of
a
very
origin
some
of
my
colored
friends
in
new
bedford
thought
very
badly
of
my
wisdom
for
thus
exposing
and
degrading
myself
the
only
precaution
i
took
at
the
beginning
to
prevent
master
thomas
from
knowing
where
i
was
and
what
i
was
about
was
the
withholding
my
former
name
my
master
s
name
and
the
name
of
the
state
and
county
from
which
i
came
during
the
first
three
or
four
months
my
speeches
were
almost
exclusively
made
up
of
narrations
of
my
own
personal
experience
as
a
slave
let
us
have
the
facts
said
the
people
so
also
said
friend
george
foster
who
always
wished
to
pin
me
down
to
my
simple
narrative
give
us
the
facts
said
collins
we
will
take
care
of
the
just
here
arose
some
embarrassment
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
repeat
the
same
old
story
month
after
month
and
to
keep
up
my
interest
in
it
it
was
new
to
the
people
it
is
true
but
it
was
an
old
story
to
me
and
to
go
through
with
it
night
after
night
was
a
task
altogether
too
mechanical
for
my
nature
tell
your
story
frederick
would
whisper
my
then
revered
friend
william
lloyd
garrison
as
i
stepped
upon
the
platform
i
could
not
always
obey
for
i
was
now
reading
and
thinking
new
views
of
the
subject
were
presented
to
my
mind
it
did
not
entirely
satisfy
me
to
wrongs
i
felt
like
them
i
could
not
always
curb
my
moral
indignation
for
the
perpetrators
of
slaveholding
villainy
long
enough
for
a
circumstantial
statement
of
the
facts
which
i
felt
almost
everybody
must
know
besides
i
was
growing
and
needed
room
people
won
t
believe
you
ever
was
a
slave
frederick
if
you
keep
on
this
way
said
friend
foster
be
yourself
said
collins
and
tell
your
it
was
said
to
me
better
have
a
of
the
plantation
manner
of
speech
than
not
tis
not
best
that
you
seem
too
these
excellent
friends
were
actuated
by
the
best
of
motives
and
were
not
altogether
wrong
in
their
advice
and
still
i
must
speak
just
the
word
that
seemed
to
the
word
to
be
spoken
me
at
last
the
apprehended
trouble
came
people
doubted
if
i
had
ever
been
a
slave
they
said
i
did
not
talk
like
a
slave
look
like
a
slave
nor
act
like
a
slave
and
that
they
believed
i
had
never
been
south
of
mason
and
dixon
s
line
he
don
t
tell
us
where
he
came
from
what
his
master
s
name
was
how
he
got
away
nor
the
story
of
his
experience
besides
he
is
educated
and
is
in
this
a
contradiction
of
all
the
facts
we
have
concerning
the
ignorance
of
the
thus
i
was
in
a
pretty
fair
way
to
be
denounced
as
an
impostor
the
committee
of
the
massachusetts
society
knew
all
the
facts
in
my
case
and
agreed
with
me
in
the
prudence
of
keeping
them
private
they
therefore
never
doubted
my
being
a
genuine
fugitive
but
going
down
the
aisles
of
the
churches
in
which
i
spoke
and
hearing
the
free
spoken
yankees
saying
repeatedly
he
s
never
been
a
slave
i
ll
warrant
i
resolved
to
dispel
all
doubt
at
no
distant
day
by
such
a
revelation
of
facts
as
could
not
be
made
by
any
other
than
a
genuine
fugitive
in
a
little
less
than
four
years
therefore
after
becoming
a
public
lecturer
i
was
induced
to
write
out
the
leading
facts
connected
with
my
experience
in
slavery
giving
names
of
persons
places
and
dates
thus
putting
it
in
the
power
of
any
who
doubted
to
ascertain
the
truth
or
falsehood
of
my
story
of
being
a
fugitive
slave
this
statement
soon
became
known
in
maryland
and
i
had
reason
to
believe
that
an
effort
would
be
made
to
recapture
me
it
is
not
probable
that
any
open
attempt
to
secure
me
as
a
slave
could
have
succeeded
further
than
the
obtainment
by
my
master
of
the
money
value
of
my
bones
and
sinews
fortunately
for
me
in
the
four
years
of
my
labors
in
the
abolition
cause
i
had
gained
many
friends
who
would
have
suffered
themselves
to
be
taxed
to
almost
any
extent
to
save
me
from
slavery
it
was
felt
that
i
had
committed
the
double
offense
of
running
away
and
exposing
the
secrets
and
crimes
of
slavery
and
slaveholders
there
was
a
double
motive
for
seeking
my
reenslavement
avarice
and
vengeance
and
while
as
i
have
said
there
was
little
probability
of
successful
recapture
if
attempted
openly
i
was
constantly
in
danger
of
being
spirited
away
at
a
moment
when
my
friends
could
render
me
no
assistance
in
traveling
about
from
place
to
place
often
alone
i
was
much
exposed
to
this
sort
of
attack
any
one
cherishing
the
design
to
betray
me
could
easily
do
so
by
simply
tracing
my
whereabouts
through
the
journals
for
my
meetings
and
movements
were
promptly
made
known
in
advance
my
true
friends
garrison
and
phillips
had
no
faith
in
the
power
of
massachusetts
to
protect
me
in
my
right
to
liberty
public
sentiment
and
the
law
in
their
opinion
would
hand
me
over
to
the
tormentors
phillips
especially
considered
me
in
danger
and
said
when
i
showed
him
the
manuscript
of
my
story
if
in
my
place
he
would
throw
it
into
the
fire
thus
the
reader
will
observe
the
settling
of
one
difficulty
only
opened
the
way
for
another
and
that
though
i
had
reached
a
free
state
and
had
attained
position
for
public
usefulness
i
ws
sic
still
tormented
with
the
liability
of
losing
my
liberty
how
this
liability
was
dispelled
will
be
related
with
other
incidents

thus
the
painful
liability
to
be
returned
again
to
slavery
which
haunted
me
by
day
and
troubled
my
dreams
by
night
proved
to
be
a
necessary
step
in
the
path
of
knowledge
and
usefulness
the
writing
of
my
pamphlet
in
the
spring
of
endangered
my
liberty
and
led
me
to
seek
a
refuge
from
republican
slavery
in
monarchical
england
a
rude
uncultivated
fugitive
slave
was
driven
by
stern
necessity
to
that
country
to
which
young
american
gentlemen
go
to
increase
their
stock
of
knowledge
to
seek
pleasure
to
have
their
rough
democratic
manners
softened
by
contact
with
english
aristocratic
refinement
on
applying
for
a
passage
to
england
on
board
the
cambria
of
the
cunard
line
my
friend
james
buffum
of
lynn
massachusetts
was
informed
that
i
could
not
be
received
on
board
as
a
cabin
passenger
american
prejudice
against
color
triumphed
over
british
liberality
and
civilization
and
erected
a
color
test
and
condition
for
crossing
the
sea
in
the
cabin
of
a
british
vessel
the
insult
was
keenly
felt
by
my
white
friends
but
to
me
it
was
common
expected
and
therefore
a
thing
of
no
great
consequence
whether
i
went
in
the
cabin
or
in
the
steerage
moreover
i
felt
that
if
i
could
not
go
into
the
first
cabin
passengers
could
come
into
the
second
cabin
and
the
result
justified
my
anticipations
to
the
fullest
extent
indeed
i
soon
found
myself
an
object
of
more
general
interest
than
i
wished
to
be
and
so
far
from
being
degraded
by
being
placed
in
the
second
cabin
that
part
of
the
ship
became
the
scene
of
as
much
pleasure
and
refinement
during
the
voyage
as
the
cabin
itself
the
hutchinson
family
celebrated
vocalists
often
came
to
my
rude
forecastle
deck
and
sung
their
sweetest
songs
enlivening
the
place
with
eloquent
music
as
well
as
spirited
conversation
during
the
voyage
in
two
days
after
leaving
boston
one
part
of
the
ship
was
about
as
free
to
me
as
another
my
not
only
visited
me
but
invited
me
to
visit
them
on
the
saloon
deck
my
visits
there
however
were
but
seldom
i
preferred
to
live
within
my
privileges
and
keep
upon
my
own
premises
i
found
this
quite
as
much
in
accordance
with
good
policy
as
with
my
own
feelings
the
effect
was
that
with
the
majority
of
the
passengers
all
color
distinctions
were
flung
to
the
winds
and
i
found
myself
treated
with
every
mark
of
respect
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
the
voyage
except
in
a
single
instance
and
in
that
i
came
near
being
mobbed
for
complying
with
an
invitation
given
me
by
the
passengers
and
the
captain
of
the
cambria
to
deliver
a
lecture
on
slavery
our
new
orleans
and
georgia
passengers
were
pleased
to
regard
my
lecture
as
an
insult
offered
to
them
and
swore
i
should
not
speak
they
went
so
far
as
to
threaten
to
throw
me
overboard
and
but
for
the
firmness
of
captain
judkins
probably
would
have
under
the
inspiration
of
and
attempted
to
put
their
threats
into
execution
i
have
no
space
to
describe
this
scene
although
its
tragic
and
comic
peculiarities
are
well
worth
describing
an
end
was
put
to
the
by
the
captain
s
calling
the
ship
s
company
to
put
the
salt
water
mobocrats
in
irons
at
this
determined
order
the
gentlemen
of
the
lash
scampered
and
for
the
rest
of
the
voyage
conducted
themselves
very
decorously
this
incident
of
the
voyage
in
two
days
after
landing
at
liverpool
brought
me
at
once
before
the
british
public
and
that
by
no
act
of
my
own
the
gentlemen
so
promptly
snubbed
in
their
meditated
violence
flew
to
the
press
to
justify
their
conduct
and
to
denounce
me
as
a
worthless
and
insolent
negro
this
course
was
even
less
wise
than
the
conduct
it
was
intended
to
sustain
for
besides
awakening
something
like
a
national
interest
in
me
and
securing
me
an
audience
it
brought
out
counter
statements
and
threw
the
blame
upon
themselves
which
they
had
sought
to
fasten
upon
me
and
the
gallant
captain
of
the
ship
some
notion
may
be
formed
of
the
difference
in
my
feelings
and
circumstances
while
abroad
from
the
following
extract
from
one
of
a
series
of
letters
addressed
by
me
to
garrison
and
published
in
the
it
was
written
on
the
first
day
of
january
my
dear
friend
garrison
up
to
this
time
i
have
given
no
direct
expression
of
the
views
feelings
and
opinions
which
i
have
formed
respecting
the
character
and
condition
of
the
people
of
this
land
i
have
refrained
thus
purposely
i
wish
to
speak
advisedly
and
in
order
to
do
this
i
have
waited
till
i
trust
experience
has
brought
my
opinions
to
an
intelligent
maturity
i
have
been
thus
careful
not
because
i
think
what
i
say
will
have
much
effect
in
shaping
the
opinions
of
the
world
but
because
whatever
of
influence
i
may
possess
whether
little
or
much
i
wish
it
to
go
in
the
right
direction
and
according
to
truth
i
hardly
need
say
that
in
speaking
of
ireland
i
shall
be
influenced
by
no
prejudices
in
favor
of
america
i
think
my
circumstances
all
forbid
that
i
have
no
end
to
serve
no
creed
to
uphold
no
government
to
defend
and
as
to
nation
i
belong
to
none
i
have
no
protection
at
home
or
abroad
the
land
of
my
birth
welcomes
me
to
her
shores
only
as
a
slave
and
spurns
with
contempt
the
idea
of
treating
me
differently
so
that
i
am
an
outcast
from
the
society
of
my
childhood
and
an
outlaw
in
the
land
of
my
birth
i
am
a
stranger
with
thee
and
a
sojourner
as
all
my
fathers
that
men
should
be
patriotic
is
to
me
perfectly
natural
and
as
a
philosophical
fact
i
am
able
to
give
it
an
recognition
but
no
further
can
i
go
if
ever
i
had
any
patriotism
or
any
capacity
for
the
feeling
it
was
whipped
out
of
me
long
since
by
the
lash
of
the
american
in
thinking
of
america
i
sometimes
find
myself
admiring
her
bright
blue
sky
her
grand
old
woods
her
fertile
fields
her
beautiful
rivers
her
mighty
lakes
and
mountains
but
my
rapture
is
soon
checked
my
joy
is
soon
turned
to
mourning
when
i
remember
that
all
is
cursed
with
the
infernal
spirit
of
slaveholding
robbery
and
wrong
when
i
remember
that
with
the
waters
of
her
noblest
rivers
the
tears
of
my
brethren
are
borne
to
the
ocean
disregarded
and
forgotten
and
that
her
most
fertile
fields
drink
daily
of
the
warm
blood
of
my
outraged
sisters
i
am
filled
with
unutterable
loathing
and
led
to
reproach
myself
that
anything
could
fall
from
my
lips
in
praise
of
such
a
land
america
will
not
allow
her
children
to
love
her
she
seems
bent
on
compelling
those
who
would
be
her
warmest
friends
to
be
her
worst
enemies
may
god
give
her
repentance
before
it
is
too
late
is
the
ardent
prayer
of
my
heart
i
will
continue
to
pray
labor
and
wait
believing
that
she
can
not
always
be
insensible
to
the
dictates
of
justice
or
deaf
to
the
voice
of
humanity
my
opportunities
for
learning
the
character
and
condition
of
the
people
of
this
land
have
been
very
great
i
have
traveled
almost
from
the
hill
of
howth
to
the
giant
s
causeway
and
from
the
giant
s
causway
to
cape
clear
during
these
travels
i
have
met
with
much
in
the
chara
and
condition
of
the
people
to
approve
and
much
to
condemn
much
that
thrilled
me
with
pleasure
and
very
much
that
has
filled
me
with
pain
i
t
in
this
letter
attempt
to
give
any
description
of
those
scenes
which
have
given
me
pain
this
i
will
do
hereafter
i
have
enough
and
more
than
your
subscribers
will
be
disposed
to
read
at
one
time
of
the
bright
side
of
the
picture
i
can
truly
say
i
have
spent
some
of
the
happiest
moments
of
my
life
since
landing
in
this
country
i
seem
to
have
undergone
a
transformation
i
live
a
new
life
the
warm
and
generous
cooperation
extended
to
me
by
the
friends
of
my
despised
race
the
prompt
and
liberal
manner
with
which
the
press
has
rendered
me
its
aid
the
glorious
enthusiasm
with
which
thousands
have
flocked
to
hear
the
cruel
wrongs
of
my
and
portrayed
the
deep
sympathy
for
the
slave
and
the
strong
abhorrence
of
the
slaveholder
everywhere
evinced
the
cordiality
with
which
members
and
ministers
of
various
religious
bodies
and
of
various
shades
of
religious
opinion
have
embraced
me
and
lent
me
their
aid
the
kind
of
hospitality
constantly
proffered
to
me
by
persons
of
the
highest
rank
in
society
the
spirit
of
freedom
that
seems
to
animate
all
with
whom
i
come
in
contact
and
the
entire

of
everything
that
looked
like

strongly

long
and
bitter
experience

look
with
wonder
and
amazement
on
the

was

behold

eleven

half
gone

i
have
crossed
three
thousand
miles
of
the
perilous
deep
instead

lo
the

becomes

gaze
around
in

will

i
am
seated

i
reach
the
hotel
i
enter
the
same
door
i
am
shown
into
the
same
parlor
i
dine
at
the
same
table
and
no
one
is
offended
no
delicate
nose
grows
deformed
in
my
presence
i
find
no
difficulty
here
in
obtaining
admission
into
any
place
of
worship
instruction
or
amusement
on
equal
terms
with
people
as
white
as
any
i
ever
saw
in
the
united
states
i
meet
nothing
to
remind
me
of
my
complexion
i
find
myself
regarded
and
treated
at
every
turn
with
the
kindness
and
deference
paid
to
white
people
when
i
go
to
church
i
am
met
by
no
upturned
nose
and
scornful
lip
to
tell
me
don
t
allow
niggers
in
i
remember
about
two
years
ago
there
was
in
boston
near
the
corner
of
boston
common
a
menagerie
i
had
long
desired
to
see
such
a
collection
as
i
understood
was
being
exhibited
there
never
having
had
an
opportunity
while
a
slave
i
resolved
to
seize
this
my
first
since
my
escape
i
went
and
as
i
approached
the
entrance
to
gain
admission
i
was
met
and
told
by
the
in
a
harsh
and
contemptuous
tone
don
t
allow
niggers
in
i
also
remember
attending
a
revival
meeting
in
the
rev
henry
jackson
s
at
new
bedford
and
going
up
the
broad
aisle
to
find
a
seat
i
was
met
by
a
good
deacon
who
told
me
in
a
pious
tone
don
t
allow
niggers
in
soon
after
my
arrival
in
new
bedford
from
the
south
i
had
a
strong
desire
to
attend
the
lyceum
but
was
told
don
t
allow
niggers
in
while
passing
from
new
york
to
boston
on
the
steamer
massachusetts
on
the
night
of
the
of
december
when
chilled
almost
through
with
the
cold
i
went
into
the
cabin
to
get
a
little
warm
i
was
soon
touched
upon
the
shoulder
and
told
don
t
allow
niggers
in
on
arriving
in
boston
from
an
tour
hungry
and
tired
i
went
into
an
near
my
friend
campbell
s
to
get
some
refreshments
i
was
met
by
a
lad
in
a
white
apron
don
t
allow
niggers
in
a
week
or
two
before
leaving
the
united
states
i
had
a
meeting
appointed
at
weymouth
the
home
of
that
glorious
band
of
true
abolitionists
the
weston
family
and
others
on
attempting
to
take
a
seat
in
the
omnibus
to
that
place
i
was
told
by
the
driver
and
i
never
shall
forget
his
fiendish
hate
don
t
allow
niggers
in
thank
heaven
for
the
respite
i
now
enjoy
i
had
been
in
dublin
but
a
few
days
when
a
gentleman
of
great
respectability
kindly
offered
to
conduct
me
through
all
the
public
buildings
of
that
beautiful
city
and
a
little
afterward
i
found
myself
dining
with
the
lord
mayor
of
dublin
what
a
pity
there
was
not
some
american
democratic
christian
at
the
door
of
his
splendid
mansion
to
bark
out
at
my
approach
don
t
allow
niggers
in
the
truth
is
the
people
here
know
nothing
of
the
republican
negro
hate
prevalent
in
our
glorious
land
they
measure
and
esteem
men
according
to
their
moral
and
intellectual
worth
and
not
according
to
the
color
of
their
skin
whatever
may
be
said
of
the
aristocracies
here
there
is
none
based
on
the
color
of
a
man
s
skin
this
species
of
aristocracy
belongs
preeminently
to
the
land
of
the
free
and
the
home
of
the
i
have
never
found
it
abroad
in
any
but
americans
it
sticks
to
them
wherever
they
go
they
find
it
almost
as
hard
to
get
rid
of
as
to
get
rid
of
their
skins
the
second
day
after
my
arrival
at
liverpool
in
company
with
my
friend
buffum
and
several
other
friends
i
went
to
eaton
hall
the
residence
of
the
marquis
of
westminster
one
of
the
most
splendid
buildings
in
england
on
approaching
the
door
i
found
several
of
our
american
passengers
who
came
out
with
us
in
the
cambria
waiting
for
admission
as
but
one
party
was
allowed
in
the
house
at
a
time
we
all
had
to
wait
till
the
company
within
came
out
and
of
all
the
faces
expressive
of
chagrin
those
of
the
americans
were
preeminent
they
looked
as
sour
as
vinegar
and
as
bitter
as
gall
when
they
found
i
was
to
be
admitted
on
equal
terms
with
themselves
when
the
door
was
opened
i
walked
in
on
an
equal
footing
with
my
white
and
from
all
i
could
see
i
had
as
much
attention
paid
me
by
the
servants
that
showed
us
through
the
house
as
any
with
a
paler
skin
as
i
walked
through
the
building
the
statuary
did
not
fall
down
the
pictures
did
not
leap
from
their
places
the
doors
did
not
refuse
to
open
and
the
servants
did
not
say
don
t
allow
niggers
in
a
happy
to
you
and
all
the
friends
of
freedom
my
time
and
labors
while
abroad
were
divided
between
england
ireland
scotland
and
wales
upon
this
experience
alone
i
might
write
a
book
twice
the
size
of
this
bondage
and
my
i
visited
and
lectured
in
nearly
all
the
large
towns
and
cities
in
the
united
kingdom
and
enjoyed
many
favorable
opportunities
for
observation
and
information
but
books
on
england
are
abundant
and
the
public
may
therefore
dismiss
any
fear
that
i
am
meditating
another
infliction
in
that
line
though
in
truth
i
should
like
much
to
write
a
book
on
those
countries
if
for
nothing
else
to
make
grateful
mention
of
the
many
dear
friends
whose
benevolent
actions
toward
me
are
ineffaceably
stamped
upon
my
memory
and
warmly
treasured
in
my
heart
to
these
friends
i
owe
my
freedom
in
the
united
states
on
their
own
motion
without
any
solicitation
from
me
henry
richardson
a
clever
lady
remarkable
for
her
devotion
to
every
good
work
taking
the
lead
they
raised
a
fund
sufficient
to
purchase
my
freedom
and
actually
paid
it
over
and
placed
the
papers
of
my
manumission
in
my
hands
before
they
would
tolerate
the
idea
of
my
returning
to
this
my
native
country
to
this
commercial
transaction
i
owe
my
exemption
from
the
democratic
operation
of
the
fugitive
slave
bill
of
but
for
this
i
might
at
any
time
become
a
victim
of
this
most
cruel
and
scandalous
enactment
and
be
doomed
to
end
my
life
as
i
began
it
a
slave
the
sum
paid
for
my
freedom
was
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
sterling
some
of
my
uncompromising
friends
in
this
country
failed
to
see
the
wisdom
of
this
arrangement
and
were
not
pleased
that
i
consented
to
it
even
by
my
silence
they
thought
it
a
violation
of
principles
conceding
a
right
of
property
in
man
and
a
wasteful
expenditure
of
money
on
the
other
hand
viewing
it
simply
in
the
light
of
a
ransom
or
as
money
extorted
by
a
robber
and
my
liberty
of
more
value
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
sterling
i
could
not
see
either
a
violation
of
the
laws
of
morality
or
those
of
economy
in
the
transaction
it
is
true
i
was
not
in
the
possession
of
my
claimants
and
could
have
easily
remained
in
england
for
the
same
friends
who
had
so
generously
purchased
my
freedom
would
have
assisted
me
in
establishing
myself
in
that
country
to
this
however
i
could
not
consent
i
felt
that
i
had
a
duty
to
perform
and
that
was
to
labor
and
suffer
with
the
oppressed
in
my
native
land
considering
therefore
all
the
circumstances
the
fugitive
slave
bill
included
i
think
the
very
best
thing
was
done
in
letting
master
hugh
have
the
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
sterling
and
leaving
me
free
to
return
to
my
appropriate
field
of
labor
had
i
been
a
private
person
having
no
other
relations
or
duties
than
those
of
a
personal
and
family
nature
i
should
never
have
consented
to
the
payment
of
so
large
a
sum
for
the
privilege
of
living
securely
under
our
glorious
republican
form
of
government
i
could
have
remained
in
england
or
have
gone
to
some
other
country
and
perhaps
i
could
even
have
lived
unobserved
in
this
but
to
this
i
could
not
consent
i
had
already
become
some
what
notorious
and
withal
quite
as
unpopular
as
notorious
and
i
was
therefore
much
exposed
to
arrest
and
recapture
the
main
object
to
which
my
labors
in
great
britain
were
directed
was
the
concentration
of
the
moral
and
religious
sentiment
of
its
people
against
american
slavery
england
is
often
charged
with
having
established
slavery
in
the
united
states
and
if
there
were
no
other
justification
than
this
for
appealing
to
her
people
to
lend
their
moral
aid
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
i
should
be
justified
my
speeches
in
great
britain
were
wholly
extemporaneous
and
i
may
not
always
have
been
so
guarded
in
my
expressions
as
i
otherwise
should
have
been
i
was
ten
years
younger
then
than
now
and
only
seven
years
from
slavery
i
can
not
give
the
reader
a
better
idea
of
the
nature
of
my
discourses
than
by
republishing
one
of
them
delivered
in
finsbury
chapel
london
to
an
audience
of
about
two
thousand
persons
and
which
was
published
in
the
at
the
time
those
in
the
united
states
who
may
regard
this
speech
as
being
harsh
in
its
spirit
and
unjust
in
its
statements
because
delivered
before
an
audience
supposed
to
be
in
their
principles
and
feelings
may
view
the
matter
differently
when
they
learn
that
the
case
supposed
did
not
exist
it
so
happened
that
the
great
mass
of
the
people
in
england
who
attended
and
patronized
my
meetings
were
in
truth
about
as
good
republicans
as
the
mass
of
americans
and
with
this
decided
advantage
over
the
latter
they
are
lovers
of
republicanism
for
all
men
for
black
men
as
well
as
for
white
men
they
are
the
people
who
sympathize
with
louis
kossuth
and
mazzini
and
with
the
oppressed
and
enslaved
of
every
color
and
nation
the
world
over
they
constitute
the
democratic
element
in
british
politics
and
are
as
much
opposed
to
the
union
of
church
and
state
as
we
in
america
are
to
such
an
union
at
the
meeting
where
this
speech
was
delivered
joseph
sturge
a
philanthropist
and
a
member
of
the
society
of
friends
presided
and
addressed
the
meeting
george
william
alexander
another
friend
who
has
spent
more
than
an
ameriacn
sic
fortune
in
promoting
the
cause
in
different
sections
of
the
world
was
on
the
platform
and
also
campbell
now
of
the
who
combines
all
the
humane
tenderness
of
melanchthon
with
the
directness
and
boldness
of
luther
he
is
in
the
very
front
ranks
of
and
looks
with
no
unfriendly
eye
upon
america
george
thompson
too
was
there
and
america
will
yet
own
that
he
did
a
true
man
s
work
in
relighting
the
rapidly
fire
of
true
republicanism
in
the
american
heart
and
be
ashamed
of
the
treatment
he
met
at
her
hands
coming
generations
in
this
country
will
applaud
the
spirit
of
this
much
abused
republican
friend
of
freedom
there
were
others
of
note
seated
on
the
platform
who
would
gladly
ingraft
upon
english
institutions
all
that
is
purely
republican
in
the
institutions
of
america
nothing
therefore
must
be
set
down
against
this
speech
on
the
score
that
it
was
delivered
in
the
presence
of
those
who
can
not
appreciate
the
many
excellent
things
belonging
to
our
system
of
government
and
with
a
view
to
stir
up
prejudice
against
republican
institutions
again
let
it
also
be
remembered
for
it
is
the
simple
truth
that
neither
in
this
speech
nor
in
any
other
which
i
delivered
in
england
did
i
ever
allow
myself
to
address
englishmen
as
against
americans
i
took
my
stand
on
the
high
ground
of
human
brotherhood
and
spoke
to
englishmen
as
men
in
behalf
of
men
slavery
is
a
crime
not
against
englishmen
but
against
god
and
all
the
members
of
the
human
family
and
it
belongs
to
the
whole
human
family
to
seek
its
suppression
in
a
letter
to
greeley
of
the
new
york
tribune
written
while
abroad
i
said
i
am
nevertheless
aware
that
the
wisdom
of
exposing
the
sins
of
one
nation
in
the
ear
of
another
has
been
seriously
questioned
by
good
and
people
both
on
this
and
on
your
side
of
the
atlantic
and
the
thought
is
not
without
weight
on
my
own
mind
i
am
satisfied
that
there
are
many
evils
which
can
be
best
removed
by
confining
our
efforts
to
the
immediate
locality
where
such
evils
exist
this
however
is
by
no
means
the
case
with
the
system
of
slavery
it
is
such
a
giant
sin
such
a
monstrous
aggregation
of
iniquity
so
hardening
to
the
human
heart
so
destructive
to
the
moral
sense
and
so
well
calculated
to
beget
a
character
in
every
one
around
it
favorable
to
its
own
continuance
that
i
feel
not
only
at
liberty
but
abundantly
justified
in
appealing
to
the
whole
world
to
aid
in
its
removal
but
even
if
i
had
as
has
been
often
charged
labored
to
bring
american
institutions
generally
into
disrepute
and
had
not
confined
my
labors
strictly
within
the
limits
of
humanity
and
morality
i
should
not
have
been
without
illustrious
examples
to
support
me
driven
into
by
civil
and
barbarous
laws
and
by
a
system
which
can
not
be
thought
of
without
a
shudder
i
was
fully
justified
in
turning
if
possible
the
tide
of
the
moral
universe
against
the
outrage
four
circumstances
greatly
assisted
me
in
getting
the
question
of
american
slavery
before
the
british
public
first
the
mob
on
board
the
cambria
already
referred
to
which
was
a
sort
of
national
announcement
of
my
arrival
in
england
secondly
the
highly
reprehensible
course
pursued
by
the
free
church
of
scotland
in
soliciting
receiving
and
retaining
money
in
its
sustentation
fund
for
supporting
the
gospel
in
scotland
which
was
evidently
the
gain
of
slaveholders
and
third
the
great
evangelical
alliance
or
rather
the
attempt
to
form
such
an
alliance
which
should
include
slaveholders
of
a
certain
description
added
immensely
to
the
interest
felt
in
the
slavery
question
about
the
same
time
there
was
the
world
s
temperance
convention
where
i
had
the
misfortune
to
come
in
collision
with
sundry
american
doctors
of
divinity
cox
among
the
number
with
whom
i
had
a
small
controversy
it
has
happened
to
me
as
it
has
happened
to
most
other
men
engaged
in
a
good
cause
often
to
be
more
indebted
to
my
enemies
than
to
my
own
skill
or
to
the
assistance
of
my
friends
for
whatever
success
has
attended
my
labors
great
surprise
was
expressed
by
american
newspapers
north
and
south
during
my
stay
in
great
britain
that
a
person
so
illiterate
and
insignificant
as
myself
could
awaken
an
interest
so
marked
in
england
these
papers
were
not
the
only
parties
surprised
i
was
myself
not
far
behind
them
in
surprise
but
the
very
contempt
and
scorn
the
systematic
and
extravagant
disparagement
of
which
i
was
the
object
served
perhaps
to
magnify
my
few
merits
and
to
render
me
of
some
account
whether
deserving
or
not
a
man
is
sometimes
made
great
by
the
greatness
of
the
abuse
a
portion
of
mankind
may
think
proper
to
heap
upon
him
whether
i
was
of
as
much
consequence
as
the
english
papers
made
me
out
to
be
or
not
it
was
easily
seen
in
england
that
i
could
not
be
the
ignorant
and
worthless
creature
some
of
the
american
papers
would
have
them
believe
i
was
men
in
their
senses
do
not
take
to
kill
mosquitoes
nor
pistols
to
shoot
flies
and
the
american
passengers
who
thought
proper
to
get
up
a
mob
to
silence
me
on
board
the
cambria
took
the
most
effective
method
of
telling
the
british
public
that
i
had
something
to
say
but
to
the
second
circumstance
namely
the
position
of
the
free
church
of
scotland
with
the
great
doctors
chalmers
cunningham
and
candlish
at
its
head
that
church
with
its
leaders
put
it
out
of
the
power
of
the
scotch
people
to
ask
the
old
question
which
we
in
the
north
have
often
most
wickedly
asked
have
we
to
do
with
that
church
had
taken
the
price
of
blood
into
its
treasury
with
which
to
build
churches
and
to
pay
church
ministers
for
preaching
the
gospel
and
worse
still
when
honest
john
murray
of
bowlien
bay
now
gone
to
his
reward
in
heaven
with
william
smeal
andrew
paton
frederick
card
and
other
sterling
men
in
glasgow
denounced
the
transaction
as
disgraceful
and
shocking
to
the
religious
sentiment
of
scotland
this
church
through
its
leading
divines
instead
of
repenting
and
seeking
to
mend
the
mistake
into
which
it
had
fallen
made
it
a
flagrant
sin
by
undertaking
to
defend
in
the
name
of
god
and
the
bible
the
principle
not
only
of
taking
the
money
of
to
build
churches
but
of
holding
fellowship
with
the
holders
and
traffickers
in
human
flesh
this
the
reader
will
see
brought
up
the
whole
question
of
slavery
and
opened
the
way
to
its
full
discussion
without
any
agency
of
mine
i
have
never
seen
a
people
more
deeply
moved
than
were
the
people
of
scotland
on
this
very
question
public
meeting
succeeded
public
meeting
speech
after
speech
pamphlet
after
pamphlet
editorial
after
editorial
sermon
after
sermon
soon
lashed
the
conscientious
scotch
people
into
a
perfect
send
back
the
money
was
indignantly
cried
out
from
greenock
to
edinburgh
and
from
edinburgh
to
aberdeen
george
thompson
of
london
henry
wright
of
the
united
states
james
buffum
of
lynn
massachusetts
and
myself
were
on
the
side
and
doctors
chalmers
cunningham
and
candlish
on
the
other
in
a
conflict
where
the
latter
could
have
had
even
the
show
of
right
the
truth
in
our
hands
as
against
them
must
have
been
driven
to
the
wall
and
while
i
believe
we
were
able
to
carry
the
conscience
of
the
country
against
the
action
of
the
free
church
the
battle
it
must
be
confessed
was
a
one
abler
defenders
of
the
doctrine
of
fellowshiping
slaveholders
as
christians
have
not
been
met
with
in
defending
this
doctrine
it
was
necessary
to
deny
that
slavery
is
a
sin
if
driven
from
this
position
they
were
compelled
to
deny
that
slaveholders
were
responsible
for
the
sin
and
if
driven
from
both
these
positions
they
must
deny
that
it
is
a
sin
in
such
a
sense
and
that
slaveholders
are
sinners
in
such
a
sense
as
to
make
it
wrong
in
the
circumstances
in
which
they
were
placed
to
recognize
them
as
christians
cunningham
was
the
most
powerful
debater
on
the
slavery
side
of
the
question
thompson
was
the
ablest
on
the
side
a
scene
occurred
between
these
two
men
a
parallel
to
which
i
think
i
never
witnessed
before
and
i
know
i
never
have
since
the
scene
was
caused
by
a
single
exclamation
on
the
part
of
thompson
the
general
assembly
of
the
free
church
was
in
progress
at
cannon
mills
edinburgh
the
building
would
hold
about
hundred
persons
and
on
this
occasion
it
was
densely
packed
notice
having
been
given
that
doctors
cunningham
and
candlish
would
speak
that
day
in
defense
of
the
relations
of
the
free
church
of
scotland
to
slavery
in
america
thompson
buffum
myself
and
a
few
friends
attended
but
sat
at
such
a
distance
and
in
such
a
position
that
perhaps
we
were
not
observed
from
the
platform
the
excitement
was
intense
having
been
greatly
increased
by
a
series
of
meetings
held
by
thompson
wright
buffum
and
myself
in
the
most
splendid
hall
in
that
most
beautiful
city
just
previous
to
the
meetings
of
the
general
assembly
send
back
the
money
stared
at
us
from
every
street
corner
send
back
the
money
in
large
capitals
adorned
the
broad
flags
of
the
pavement
send
back
the
money
was
the
chorus
of
the
popular
street
songs
send
back
the
money
was
the
heading
of
leading
editorials
in
the
daily
newspapers
this
day
at
cannon
mills
the
great
doctors
of
the
church
were
to
give
an
answer
to
this
loud
and
stern
demand
men
of
all
parties
and
all
sects
were
most
eager
to
hear
something
great
was
expected
the
occasion
was
great
the
men
great
and
great
speeches
were
expected
from
them
in
addition
to
the
outside
pressure
upon
doctors
cunningham
and
candlish
there
was
wavering
in
their
own
ranks
the
conscience
of
the
church
itself
was
not
at
ease
a
dissatisfaction
with
the
position
of
the
church
touching
slavery
was
sensibly
manifest
among
the
members
and
something
must
be
done
to
counteract
this
untoward
influence
the
great
chalmers
was
in
feeble
health
at
the
time
his
most
potent
eloquence
could
not
now
be
summoned
to
cannon
mills
as
formerly
he
whose
voice
was
able
to
rend
asunder
and
dash
down
the
granite
walls
of
the
established
church
of
scotland
and
to
lead
a
host
in
solemn
procession
from
it
as
from
a
doomed
city
was
now
old
and
enfeebled
besides
he
had
said
his
word
on
this
very
question
and
his
word
had
not
silenced
the
clamor
without
nor
stilled
the
anxious
heavings
within
the
occasion
was
momentous
and
felt
to
be
so
the
church
was
in
a
perilous
condition
a
change
of
some
sort
must
take
place
in
her
condition
or
she
must
go
to
pieces
to
stand
where
she
did
was
impossible
the
whole
weight
of
the
matter
fell
on
cunningham
and
candlish
no
shoulders
in
the
church
were
broader
than
theirs
and
i
must
say
badly
as
i
detest
the
principles
laid
down
and
defended
by
them
i
was
compelled
to
acknowledge
the
vast
mental
endowments
of
the
men
cunningham
rose
and
his
rising
was
the
signal
for
almost
tumultous
applause
you
will
say
this
was
scarcely
in
keeping
with
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
but
to
me
it
served
to
increase
its
grandeur
and
gravity
the
applause
though
tumultuous
was
not
joyous
it
seemed
to
me
as
it
thundered
up
from
the
vast
audience
like
the
fall
of
an
immense
shaft
flung
from
shoulders
already
galled
by
its
crushing
weight
it
was
like
saying
doctor
we
have
borne
this
burden
long
enough
and
willingly
fling
it
upon
you
since
it
was
you
who
brought
it
upon
us
take
it
now
and
do
what
you
will
with
it
for
we
are
too
weary
to
bear
it
no
close
doctor
cunningham
proceeded
with
his
speech
abounding
in
logic
learning
and
eloquence
and
apparently
bearing
down
all
opposition
but
at
the
moment
the
fatal
moment
when
he
was
just
bringing
all
his
arguments
to
a
point
and
that
point
being
that
neither
jesus
christ
nor
his
holy
apostles
regarded
slaveholding
as
a
sin
george
thompson
in
a
clear
sonorous
but
rebuking
voice
broke
the
deep
stillness
of
the
audience
exclaiming
hear
hear
hear
the
effect
of
this
simple
and
common
exclamation
is
almost
incredible
it
was
as
if
a
granite
wall
had
been
suddenly
flung
up
against
the
advancing
current
of
a
mighty
river
for
a
moment
speaker
and
audience
were
brought
to
a
dead
silence
both
the
doctor
and
his
hearers
seemed
appalled
by
the
audacity
as
well
as
the
fitness
of
the
rebuke
at
length
a
shout
went
up
to
the
cry
of
him
happily
no
one
attempted
to
execute
this
cowardly
order
and
the
doctor
proceeded
with
his
discourse
not
however
as
before
did
the
learned
doctor
proceed
the
exclamation
of
thompson
must
have
reechoed
itself
a
thousand
times
in
his
memory
during
the
remainder
of
his
speech
for
the
doctor
never
recovered
from
the
blow
the
deed
was
done
however
the
pillars
of
the
church
proud
free
church
of
were
committed
and
the
humility
of
repentance
was
absent
the
free
church
held
on
to
the
money
and
continued
to
justify
itself
in
its
position
and
of
course
to
apologize
for
slavery
and
does
so
till
this
day
she
lost
a
glorious
opportunity
for
giving
her
voice
her
vote
and
her
example
to
the
cause
of
humanity
and
she
is
staggering
under
the
curse
of
the
enslaved
whose
blood
is
in
her
skirts
the
people
of
scotland
are
to
this
day
deeply
grieved
at
the
course
pursued
by
the
free
church
and
would
hail
as
a
relief
from
a
deep
and
blighting
shame
the
sending
back
the
money
to
the
slaveholders
from
whom
it
was
gathered
one
good
result
followed
the
conduct
of
the
free
church
it
furnished
an
occasion
for
making
the
people
of
scotland
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
character
of
slavery
and
for
arraying
against
the
system
the
moral
and
religious
sentiment
of
that
country
therefore
while
we
did
not
succeed
in
accomplishing
the
specific
object
of
our
mission
namely
procure
the
sending
back
of
the
money
we
were
amply
justified
by
the
good
which
really
did
result
from
our
labors
next
comes
the
evangelical
alliance
this
was
an
attempt
to
form
a
union
of
all
evangelical
christians
throughout
the
world
sixty
or
seventy
american
divines
attended
and
some
of
them
went
there
merely
to
weave
a
garment
with
which
to
clothe
evangelical
slaveholders
foremost
among
these
divines
was
the
rev
samuel
hanson
cox
moderator
of
the
new
school
presbyterian
general
assembly
he
and
his
friends
spared
no
pains
to
secure
a
platform
broad
enough
to
hold
american
slaveholders
and
in
this
partly
succeeded
but
the
question
of
slavery
is
too
large
a
question
to
be
finally
disposed
of
even
by
the
evangelical
alliance
we
appealed
from
the
judgment
of
the
alliance
to
the
judgment
of
the
people
of
great
britain
and
with
the
happiest
effect
this
controversy
with
the
alliance
might
be
made
the
subject
of
extended
remark
but
i
must
forbear
except
to
say
that
this
effort
to
shield
the
christian
character
of
slaveholders
greatly
served
to
open
a
way
to
the
british
ear
for
discussion
and
that
it
was
well
improved
the
fourth
and
last
circumstance
that
assisted
me
in
getting
before
the
british
public
was
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
certain
doctors
of
divinity
to
silence
me
on
the
platform
of
the
world
s
temperance
convention
here
i
was
brought
into
point
blank
collison
with
rev
cox
who
made
me
the
subject
not
only
of
bitter
remark
in
the
convention
but
also
of
a
long
denunciatory
letter
published
in
the
new
york
evangelist
and
other
american
papers
i
replied
to
the
doctor
as
well
as
i
could
and
was
successful
in
getting
a
respectful
hearing
before
the
british
public
who
are
by
nature
and
practice
ardent
lovers
of
fair
play
especially
in
a
conflict
between
the
weak
and
the
strong
thus
did
circumstances
favor
me
and
favor
the
cause
of
which
i
strove
to
be
the
advocate
after
such
distinguished
notice
the
public
in
both
countries
was
compelled
to
attach
some
importance
to
my
labors
by
the
very
ill
usage
i
received
at
the
hands
of
cox
and
his
party
by
the
mob
on
board
the
cambria
by
the
attacks
made
upon
me
in
the
american
newspapers
and
by
the
aspersions
cast
upon
me
through
the
organs
of
the
free
church
of
scotland
i
became
one
of
that
class
of
men
who
for
the
moment
at
least
have
greatness
forced
upon
people
became
the
more
anxious
to
hear
for
themselves
and
to
judge
for
themselves
of
the
truth
which
i
had
to
unfold
while
therefore
it
is
by
no
means
easy
for
a
stranger
to
get
fairly
before
the
british
public
it
was
my
lot
to
accomplish
it
in
the
easiest
manner
possible
having
continued
in
great
britain
and
ireland
nearly
two
years
and
being
about
to
return
to
america
not
as
i
left
it
a
slave
but
a
freeman
leading
friends
of
the
cause
of
emancipation
in
that
country
intimated
their
intention
to
make
me
a
testimonial
not
only
on
grounds
of
personal
regard
to
myself
but
also
to
the
cause
to
which
they
were
so
ardently
devoted
how
far
any
such
thing
could
have
succeeded
i
do
not
know
but
many
reasons
led
me
to
prefer
that
my
friends
should
simply
give
me
the
means
of
obtaining
a
printing
press
and
printing
materials
to
enable
me
to
start
a
paper
devoted
to
the
interests
of
my
enslaved
and
oppressed
people
i
told
them
that
perhaps
the
greatest
hinderance
to
the
adoption
of
abolition
principles
by
the
people
of
the
united
states
was
the
low
estimate
everywhere
in
that
country
placed
upon
the
negro
as
a
man
that
because
of
his
assumed
natural
inferiority
people
reconciled
themselves
to
his
enslavement
and
oppression
as
things
inevitable
if
not
desirable
the
grand
thing
to
be
done
therefore
was
to
change
the
estimation
in
which
the
colored
people
of
the
united
states
were
held
to
remove
the
prejudice
which
depreciated
and
depressed
them
to
prove
them
worthy
of
a
higher
consideration
to
disprove
their
alleged
inferiority
and
demonstrate
their
capacity
for
a
more
exalted
civilization
than
slavery
and
prejudice
had
assigned
to
them
i
further
stated
that
in
my
judgment
a
tolerably
well
conducted
press
in
the
hands
of
persons
of
the
despised
race
by
calling
out
the
mental
energies
of
the
race
itself
by
making
them
acquainted
with
their
own
latent
powers
by
enkindling
among
them
the
hope
that
for
them
there
is
a
future
by
developing
their
moral
power
by
combining
and
reflecting
their
talents
would
prove
a
most
powerful
means
of
removing
prejudice
and
of
awakening
an
interest
in
them
i
further
informed
them
and
at
that
time
the
statement
was
true
that
there
was
not
in
the
united
states
a
single
newspaper
regularly
published
by
the
colored
people
that
many
attempts
had
been
made
to
establish
such
papers
but
that
up
to
that
time
they
had
all
failed
these
views
i
laid
before
my
friends
the
result
was
nearly
two
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
were
speedily
raised
toward
starting
my
paper
for
this
prompt
and
generous
assistance
rendered
upon
my
bare
suggestion
without
any
personal
efforts
on
my
part
i
shall
never
cease
to
feel
deeply
grateful
and
the
thought
of
fulfilling
the
noble
expectations
of
the
dear
friends
who
gave
me
this
evidence
of
their
confidence
will
never
cease
to
be
a
motive
for
persevering
exertion
proposing
to
leave
england
and
turning
my
face
toward
america
in
the
spring
of
i
was
met
on
the
threshold
with
something
which
painfully
reminded
me
of
the
kind
of
life
which
awaited
me
in
my
native
land
for
the
first
time
in
the
many
months
spent
abroad
i
was
met
with
proscription
on
account
of
my
color
a
few
weeks
before
departing
from
england
while
in
london
i
was
careful
to
purchase
a
ticket
and
secure
a
berth
for
returning
home
in
the
cambria
the
steamer
in
which
i
left
the
united
states
paying
therefor
the
round
sum
of
forty
pounds
and
nineteen
shillings
sterling
this
was
first
cabin
fare
but
on
going
aboard
the
cambria
i
found
that
the
liverpool
agent
had
ordered
my
berth
to
be
given
to
another
and
had
forbidden
my
entering
the
saloon
this
contemptible
conduct
met
with
stern
rebuke
from
the
british
press
for
upon
the
point
of
leaving
england
i
took
occasion
to
expose
the
disgusting
tyranny
in
the
columns
of
the
london
that
journal
and
other
leading
journals
throughout
the
united
kingdom
held
up
the
outrage
to
unmitigated
condemnation
so
good
an
opportunity
for
calling
out
a
full
expression
of
british
sentiment
on
the
subject
had
not
before
occurred
and
it
was
most
fully
embraced
the
result
was
that
cunard
came
out
in
a
letter
to
the
public
journals
assuring
them
of
his
regret
at
the
outrage
and
promising
that
the
like
should
never
occur
again
on
board
his
steamers
and
the
like
we
believe
has
never
since
occurred
on
board
the
steamships
of
the
cunard
line
it
is
not
very
pleasant
to
be
made
the
subject
of
such
insults
but
if
all
such
necessarily
resulted
as
this
one
did
i
should
be
very
happy
to
bear
patiently
many
more
than
i
have
borne
of
the
same
sort
albeit
the
lash
of
proscription
to
a
man
accustomed
to
equal
social
position
even
for
a
time
as
i
was
has
a
sting
for
the
soul
hardly
less
severe
than
that
which
bites
the
flesh
and
draws
the
blood
from
the
back
of
the
plantation
slave
it
was
rather
hard
after
having
enjoyed
nearly
two
years
of
equal
social
privileges
in
england
often
dining
with
gentlemen
of
great
literary
social
political
and
religious
eminence
never
during
the
whole
time
having
met
with
a
single
word
look
or
gesture
which
gave
me
the
slightest
reason
to
think
my
color
was
an
offense
to
anybody
now
to
be
cooped
up
in
the
stern
of
the
cambria
and
denied
the
right
to
enter
the
saloon
lest
my
dark
presence
should
be
deemed
an
offense

years

and
two
years
of
in

and

a

ray
of
light
remains
to
be
flung
upon
my
life
during
the
last
eight
years
and
my
story
will
be
done
a
trial
awaited
me
on
my
return
from
england
to
the
united
states
for
which
i
was
but
very
imperfectly
prepared
my
plans
for
my
then
future
usefulness
as
an
advocate
were
all
settled
my
friends
in
england
had
resolved
to
raise
a
given
sum
to
purchase
for
me
a
press
and
printing
materials
and
i
already
saw
myself
wielding
my
pen
as
well
as
my
voice
in
the
great
work
of
renovating
the
public
mind
and
building
up
a
public
sentiment
which
should
at
least
send
slavery
and
oppression
to
the
grave
and
restore
to
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
the
people
with
whom
i
had
suffered
both
as
a
slave
and
as
a
freeman
intimation
had
reached
my
friends
in
boston
of
what
i
intended
to
do
before
my
arrival
and
i
was
prepared
to
find
them
favorably
disposed
toward
my
much
cherished
enterprise
in
this
i
was
mistaken
i
found
them
very
earnestly
opposed
to
the
idea
of
my
starting
a
paper
and
for
several
reasons
first
the
paper
was
not
needed
secondly
it
would
interfere
with
my
usefulness
as
a
lecturer
thirdly
i
was
better
fitted
to
speak
than
to
write
fourthly
the
paper
could
not
succeed
this
opposition
from
a
quarter
so
highly
esteemed
and
to
which
i
had
been
accustomed
to
look
for
advice
and
direction
caused
me
not
only
to
hesitate
but
inclined
me
to
abandon
the
enterprise
all
previous
attempts
to
establish
such
a
journal
having
failed
i
felt
that
probably
i
should
but
add
another
to
the
list
of
failures
and
thus
contribute
another
proof
of
the
mental
and
moral
deficiencies
of
my
race
very
much
that
was
said
to
me
in
respect
to
my
imperfect
literary
acquirements
i
felt
to
be
most
painfully
true
the
unsuccessful
projectors
of
all
the
previous
colored
newspapers
were
my
superiors
in
point
of
education
and
if
they
failed
how
could
i
hope
for
success
yet
i
did
hope
for
success
and
persisted
in
the
undertaking
some
of
my
english
friends
greatly
encouraged
me
to
go
forward
and
i
shall
never
cease
to
be
grateful
for
their
words
of
cheer
and
generous
deeds
i
can
easily
pardon
those
who
have
denounced
me
as
ambitious
and
presumptuous
in
view
of
my
persistence
in
this
enterprise
i
was
but
nine
years
from
slavery
in
point
of
mental
experience
i
was
but
nine
years
old
that
one
in
such
circumstances
should
aspire
to
establish
a
printing
press
among
an
educated
people
might
well
be
considered
if
not
ambitious
quite
silly
my
american
friends
looked
at
me
with
astonishment
a
offering
himself
to
the
public
as
an
editor
a
slave
brought
up
in
the
very
depths
of
ignorance
assuming
to
instruct
the
highly
civilized
people
of
the
north
in
the
principles
of
liberty
justice
and
humanity
the
thing
looked
absurd
nevertheless
i
persevered
i
felt
that
the
want
of
education
great
as
it
was
could
be
overcome
by
study
and
that
knowledge
would
come
by
experience
and
further
which
was
perhaps
the
most
controlling
consideration
i
thought
that
an
intelligent
public
knowing
my
early
history
would
easily
pardon
a
large
share
of
the
deficiencies
which
i
was
sure
that
my
paper
would
exhibit
the
most
distressing
thing
however
was
the
offense
which
i
was
about
to
give
my
boston
friends
by
what
seemed
to
them
a
reckless
disregard
of
their
sage
advice
i
am
not
sure
that
i
was
not
under
the
influence
of
something
like
a
slavish
adoration
of
my
boston
friends
and
i
labored
hard
to
convince
them
of
the
wisdom
of
my
undertaking
but
without
success
indeed
i
never
expect
to
succeed
although
time
has
answered
all
their
original
objections
the
paper
has
been
successful
it
is
a
large
sheet
costing
eighty
dollars
per
week
has
three
thousand
subscribers
has
been
published
regularly
nearly
eight
years
and
bids
fair
to
stand
eight
years
longer
at
any
rate
the
eight
years
to
come
are
as
full
of
promise
as
were
the
eight
that
are
past
it
is
not
to
be
concealed
however
that
the
maintenance
of
such
a
journal
under
the
circumstances
has
been
a
work
of
much
difficulty
and
could
all
the
perplexity
anxiety
and
trouble
attending
it
have
been
clearly
foreseen
i
might
have
shrunk
from
the
undertaking
as
it
is
i
rejoice
in
having
engaged
in
the
enterprise
and
count
it
joy
to
have
been
able
to
suffer
in
many
ways
for
its
success
and
for
the
success
of
the
cause
to
which
it
has
been
faithfully
devoted
i
look
upon
the
time
money
and
labor
bestowed
upon
it
as
being
amply
rewarded
in
the
development
of
my
own
mental
and
moral
energies
and
in
the
corresponding
development
of
my
deeply
injured
and
oppressed
people
from
motives
of
peace
instead
of
issuing
my
paper
in
boston
among
my
new
england
friends
i
came
to
rochester
western
new
york
among
strangers
where
the
circulation
of
my
paper
could
not
interfere
with
the
local
circulation
of
the
and
the
for
at
that
time
i
was
on
the
question
change
of
views
a
faithful
disciple
of
william
lloyd
garrison
and
fully
committed
to
his
doctrine
touching
the
character
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
of
which
he
is
the
known
and
distinguished
advocate
with
garrison
i
held
it
to
be
the
first
duty
of
the
states
to
dissolve
the
union
with
the
slaveholding
states
and
hence
my
cry
like
his
was
no
union
with
with
these
views
i
came
into
western
new
york
and
during
the
first
four
years
of
my
labor
here
i
advocated
them
with
pen
and
tongue
according
to
the
best
of
my
ability
about
four
years
ago
upon
a
reconsideration
of
the
whole
subject
i
became
convinced
that
there
was
no
necessity
for
dissolving
the
union
between
the
northern
and
southern
states
that
to
seek
this
dissolution
was
no
part
of
my
duty
as
an
abolitionist
that
to
abstain
from
voting
was
to
refuse
to
exercise
a
legitimate
and
powerful
means
for
abolishing
slavery
and
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
not
only
contained
no
guarantees
in
favor
of
slavery
but
on
the
contrary
it
is
in
its
letter
and
spirit
an
instrument
demanding
the
abolition
of
slavery
as
a
condition
of
its
own
existence
as
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
here
was
a
radical
change
in
my
opinions
and
in
the
action
logically
resulting
from
that
change
to
those
with
whom
i
had
been
in
agreement
and
in
sympathy
i
was
now
in
opposition
what
they
held
to
be
a
great
and
important
truth
i
now
looked
upon
as
a
dangerous
error
a
very
painful
and
yet
a
very
natural
thing
now
happened
those
who
could
not
see
any
honest
reasons
for
changing
their
views
as
i
had
done
could
not
easily
see
any
such
reasons
for
my
change
and
the
common
punishment
of
apostates
was
mine
the
opinions
first
entertained
were
naturally
derived
and
honestly
entertained
and
i
trust
that
my
present
opinions
have
the
same
claims
to
respect
brought
directly
when
i
escaped
from
slavery
into
contact
with
a
class
of
abolitionists
regarding
the
constitution
as
a
slaveholding
instrument
and
finding
their
views
supported
by
the
united
and
entire
history
of
every
department
of
the
government
it
is
not
strange
that
i
assumed
the
constitution
to
be
just
what
their
interpretation
made
it
i
was
bound
not
only
by
their
superior
knowledge
to
take
their
opinions
as
the
true
ones
in
respect
to
the
subject
but
also
because
i
had
no
means
of
showing
their
unsoundness
but
for
the
responsibility
of
conducting
a
public
journal
and
the
necessity
imposed
upon
me
of
meeting
opposite
views
from
abolitionists
in
this
state
i
should
in
all
probability
have
remained
as
firm
in
my
disunion
views
as
any
other
disciple
of
william
lloyd
garrison
my
new
circumstances
compelled
me
to
the
whole
subject
and
to
study
with
some
care
not
only
the
just
and
proper
rules
of
legal
interpretation
but
the
origin
design
nature
rights
powers
and
duties
of
civil
government
and
also
the
relations
which
human
beings
sustain
to
it
by
such
a
course
of
thought
and
reading
i
was
conducted
to
the
conclusion
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
inaugurated
to
form
a
more
perfect
union
establish
justice
insure
domestic
tranquillity
provide
for
the
common
defense
promote
the
general
welfare
and
secure
the
blessing
of
liberty
could
not
well
have
been
designed
at
the
same
time
to
maintain
and
perpetuate
a
system
of
rapine
and
murder
like
slavery
especially
as
not
one
word
can
be
found
in
the
constitution
to
authorize
such
a
belief
then
again
if
the
declared
purposes
of
an
instrument
are
to
govern
the
meaning
of
all
its
parts
and
details
as
they
clearly
should
the
constitution
of
our
country
is
our
warrant
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
every
state
in
the
american
union
i
mean
however
not
to
argue
but
simply
to
state
my
views
it
would
require
very
many
pages
of
a
volume
like
this
to
set
forth
the
arguments
demonstrating
the
unconstitutionality
and
the
complete
illegality
of
slavery
in
our
land
and
as
my
experience
and
not
my
arguments
is
within
the
scope
and
contemplation
of
this
volume
i
omit
the
latter
and
proceed
with
the
former
i
will
now
ask
the
kind
reader
to
go
back
a
little
in
my
story
while
i
bring
up
a
thread
left
behind
for
convenience
sake
but
which
small
as
it
is
can
not
be
properly
omitted
altogether
and
that
thread
is
american
prejudice
against
color
and
its
varied
illustrations
in
my
own
experience
when
i
first
went
among
the
abolitionists
of
new
england
and
began
to
travel
i
found
this
prejudice
very
strong
and
very
annoying
the
abolitionists
themselves
were
not
entirely
free
from
it
and
i
could
see
that
they
were
nobly
struggling
against
it
in
their
eagerness
sometimes
to
show
their
contempt
for
the
feeling
they
proved
that
they
had
not
entirely
recovered
from
it
often
illustrating
the
saying
in
their
conduct
that
a
man
may
stand
up
so
straight
as
to
lean
when
it
was
said
to
me
mr
douglass
i
will
walk
to
meeting
with
you
i
am
not
afraid
of
a
black
man
i
could
not
help
thinking
seeing
nothing
very
frightful
in
my
appearance
and
why
should
you
be
the
children
at
the
north
had
all
been
educated
to
believe
that
if
they
were
bad
the
old
man
not
the
old
would
get
them
and
it
was
evidence
of
some
courage
for
any
so
educated
to
get
the
better
of
their
fears
the
custom
of
providing
separate
cars
for
the
accommodation
of
colored
travelers
was
established
on
nearly
all
the
railroads
of
new
england
a
dozen
years
ago
regarding
this
custom
as
fostering
the
spirit
of
caste
i
made
it
a
rule
to
seat
myself
in
the
cars
for
the
accommodation
of
passengers
generally
thus
seated
i
was
sure
to
be
called
upon
to
betake
myself
to
the
crow
refusing
to
obey
i
was
often
dragged
out
of
my
seat
beaten
and
severely
bruised
by
conductors
and
brakemen
attempting
to
start
from
lynn
one
day
for
newburyport
on
the
eastern
railroad
i
went
as
my
custom
was
into
one
of
the
best
railroad
carriages
on
the
road
the
seats
were
very
luxuriant
and
beautiful
i
was
soon
waited
upon
by
the
conductor
and
ordered
out
whereupon
i
demanded
the
reason
for
my
invidious
removal
after
a
good
deal
of
parleying
i
was
told
that
it
was
because
i
was
black
this
i
denied
and
appealed
to
the
company
to
sustain
my
denial
but
they
were
evidently
unwilling
to
commit
themselves
on
a
point
so
delicate
and
requiring
such
nice
powers
of
discrimination
for
they
remained
as
dumb
as
death
i
was
soon
waited
on
by
half
a
dozen
fellows
of
the
baser
sort
just
such
as
would
volunteer
to
take
a
out
of
a
in
time
of
public
worship
and
told
that
i
must
move
out
of
that
seat
and
if
i
did
not
they
would
drag
me
out
i
refused
to
move
and
they
clutched
me
head
neck
and
shoulders
but
in
anticipation
of
the
stretching
to
which
i
was
about
to
be
subjected
i
had
interwoven
myself
among
the
seats
in
dragging
me
out
on
this
occasion
it
must
have
cost
the
company
or
thirty
dollars
for
i
tore
up
seats
and
all
so
great
was
the
excitement
in
lynn
on
the
subject
that
the
superintendent
stephen
a
chase
ordered
the
trains
to
run
through
lynn
without
stopping
while
i
remained
in
that
town
and
this
ridiculous
farce
was
enacted
for
several
days
the
trains
went
dashing
through
lynn
without
stopping
at
the
same
time
that
they
excluded
a
free
colored
man
from
their
cars
this
same
company
allowed
slaves
in
company
with
their
masters
and
mistresses
to
ride
unmolested
after
many
battles
with
the
railroad
conductors
and
being
roughly
handled
in
not
a
few
instances
proscription
was
at
last
abandoned
and
the

car
set
up
for
the
degradation
of

found

this
result
was
not
brought
about
without
the
intervention
of
the
people

hon
charles
francis
adams
performed
signal
service
in
the
massachusetts
legislature
in
bringing
this
reformation
and
to
him
the
colored
citizens
of
that
state
are
deeply
indebted
although
often
annoyed
and
sometimes
outraged
by
this
prejudice
against
color
i
am
indebted
to
it
for
many
passages
of
quiet
amusement
a
subject
of
it
is
sometimes
driven
into
awkward
straits
especially
if
he
happens
to
get
a
genuine
specimen
of
the
race
into
his
house
in
the
summer
of
i
was
traveling
and
lecturing
in
company
with
william
a
white
through
the
state
of
indiana
friends
were
not
very
abundant
in
indiana
at
that
time
and
beds
were
not
more
plentiful
than
friends
we
often
slept
out
in
preference
to
sleeping
in
the
houses
at
some
points
at
the
close
of
one
of
our
meetings
we
were
invited
home
with
a
old
farmer
who
in
the
generous
enthusiasm
of
the
moment
seemed
to
have
forgotten
that
he
had
but
one
spare
bed
and
that
his
guests
were
an
pair
all
went
on
pretty
well
till
near
bed
time
when
signs
of
uneasiness
began
to
show
themselves
among
the
unsophisticated
sons
and
daughters
white
is
remarkably
fine
looking
and
very
evidently
a
born
gentleman
the
idea
of
putting
us
in
the
same
bed
was
hardly
to
be
tolerated
and
yet
there
we
were
and
but
the
one
bed
for
us
and
that
by
the
way
was
in
the
same
room
occupied
by
the
other
members
of
the
family
white
as
well
as
i
perceived
the
difficulty
for
yonder
slept
the
old
folks
there
the
sons
and
a
little
farther
along
slept
the
daughters
and
but
one
other
bed
remained
who
should
have
this
bed
was
the
puzzling
question
there
was
some
whispering
between
the
old
folks
some
confused
looks
among
the
young
as
the
time
for
going
to
bed
approached
after
witnessing
the
confusion
as
long
as
i
liked
i
relieved
the
family
by
playfully
saying
friend
white
having
got
entirely
rid
of
my
prejudice
against
color
i
think
as
a
proof
of
it
i
must
allow
you
to
sleep
with
me
white
kept
up
the
joke
by
seeming
to
esteem
himself
the
favored
party
and
thus
the
difficulty
was
removed
if
we
went
to
a
hotel
and
called
for
dinner
the
landlord
was
sure
to
set
one
table
for
white
and
another
for
me
always
taking
him
to
be
master
and
me
the
servant
large
eyes
were
generally
made
when
the
order
was
given
to
remove
the
dishes
from
my
table
to
that
of
white
s
in
those
days
it
was
thought
strange
that
a
white
man
and
a
colored
man
could
dine
peaceably
at
the
same
table
and
in
some
parts
the
strangeness
of
such
a
sight
has
not
entirely
subsided
some
people
will
have
it
that
there
is
a
natural
an
inherent
and
an
invincible
repugnance
in
the
breast
of
the
white
race
toward
people
and
some
very
intelligent
colored
men
think
that
their
proscription
is
owing
solely
to
the
color
which
nature
has
given
them
they
hold
that
they
are
rated
according
to
their
color
and
that
it
is
impossible
for
white
people
ever
to
look
upon
dark
races
of
men
or
men
belonging
to
the
african
race
with
other
than
feelings
of
aversion
my
experience
both
serious
and
mirthful
combats
this
conclusion
leaving
out
of
sight
for
a
moment
grave
facts
to
this
point
i
will
state
one
or
two
which
illustrate
a
very
interesting
feature
of
american
character
as
well
as
american
prejudice
riding
from
boston
to
albany
a
few
years
ago
i
found
myself
in
a
large
car
well
filled
with
passengers
the
seat
next
to
me
was
about
the
only
vacant
one
at
every
stopping
place
we
took
in
new
passengers
all
of
whom
on
reaching
the
seat
next
to
me
cast
a
disdainful
glance
upon
it
and
passed
to
another
car
leaving
me
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
a
hole
form
for
a
time
i
did
not
know
but
that
my
riding
there
was
prejudicial
to
the
interest
of
the
railroad
company
a
circumstance
occurred
however
which
gave
me
an
elevated
position
at
once
among
the
passengers
on
this
train
was
gov
george
briggs
i
was
not
acquainted
with
him
and
had
no
idea
that
i
was
known
to
him
however
i
was
for
upon
observing
me
the
governor
left
his
place
and
making
his
way
toward
me
respectfully
asked
the
privilege
of
a
seat
by
my
side
and
upon
introducing
himself
we
entered
into
a
conversation
very
pleasant
and
instructive
to
me
the
despised
seat
now
became
honored
his
excellency
had
removed
all
the
prejudice
against
sitting
by
the
side
of
a
negro
and
upon
his
leaving
it
as
he
did
on
reaching
pittsfield
there
were
at
least
one
dozen
applicants
for
the
place
the
governor
had
without
changing
my
skin
a
single
shade
made
the
place
respectable
which
before
was
despicable
a
similar
incident
happened
to
me
once
on
the
boston
and
new
bedford
railroad
and
the
leading
party
to
it
has
since
been
governor
of
the
state
of
massachusetts
i
allude
to
john
henry
clifford
lest
the
reader
may
fancy
i
am
aiming
to
elevate
myself
by
claiming
too
much
intimacy
with
great
men
i
must
state
that
my
only
acquaintance
with
clifford
was
formed
while
i
was
hired
during
the
first
winter
of
my
escape
from
slavery
i
owe
it
him
to
say
that
in
that
relation
i
found
him
always
kind
and
gentlemanly
but
to
the
incident
i
entered
a
car
at
boston
for
new
bedford
which
with
the
exception
of
a
single
seat
was
full
and
found
i
must
occupy
this
or
stand
up
during
the
journey
having
no
mind
to
do
this
i
stepped
up
to
the
man
having
the
next
seat
and
who
had
a
few
parcels
on
the
seat
and
gently
asked
leave
to
take
a
seat
by
his
side
my
gave
me
a
look
made
up
of
reproach
and
indignation
and
asked
me
why
i
should
come
to
that
particular
seat
i
assured
him
in
the
gentlest
manner
that
of
all
others
this
was
the
seat
for
me
finding
that
i
was
actually
about
to
sit
down
he
sang
out
o
stop
stop
and
let
me
get
out
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
up
the
agitated
man
got
and
sauntered
to
the
other
end
of
the
car
and
was
compelled
to
stand
for
most
of
the
way
thereafter
halfway
to
new
bedford
or
more
clifford
recognizing
me
left
his
seat
and
not
having
seen
me
before
since
i
had
ceased
to
wait
on
him
in
everything
except
hard
arguments
against
his
position
apparently
forgetful
of
his
rank
manifested
in
greeting
me
something
of
the
feeling
of
an
old
friend
this
demonstration
was
not
lost
on
the
gentleman
whose
dignity
i
had
an
hour
before
most
seriously
offended
clifford
was
known
to
be
about
the
most
aristocratic
gentleman
in
bristol
county
and
it
was
evidently
thought
that
i
must
be
somebody
else
i
should
not
have
been
thus
noticed
by
a
person
so
distinguished
sure
enough
after
clifford
left
me
i
found
myself
surrounded
with
friends
and
among
the
number
my
offended
friend
stood
nearest
and
with
an
apology
for
his
rudeness
which
i
could
not
resist
although
it
was
one
of
the
lamest
ever
offered
with
such
facts
as
these
before
me
and
i
have
many
of
them
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
pride
and
fashion
have
much
to
do
with
the
treatment
commonly
extended
to
colored
people
in
the
united
states
i
once
heard
a
very
plain
man
say
and
he
was
and
awkwardly
flung
together
in
other
respects
that
he
should
be
a
handsome
man
when
public
opinion
shall
be
changed
since
i
have
been
editing
and
publishing
a
journal
devoted
to
the
cause
of
liberty
and
progress
i
have
had
my
mind
more
directed
to
the
condition
and
circumstances
of
the
free
colored
people
than
when
i
was
the
agent
of
an
abolition
society
the
result
has
been
a
corresponding
change
in
the
disposition
of
my
time
and
labors
i
have
felt
it
to
be
a
part
of
my
mission
under
a
gracious
providence
to
impress
my
sable
brothers
in
this
country
with
the
conviction
that
notwithstanding
the
ten
thousand
discouragements
and
the
powerful
hinderances
which
beset
their
existence
in
this
country
notwithstanding
the
history
of
africa
and
her
children
from
whom
we
have
descended
or
the
clouds
and
darkness
whose
stillness
and
gloom
are
made
only
more
awful
by
wrathful
thunder
and
lightning
now
overshadowing
them
progress
is
yet
possible
and
bright
skies
shall
yet
shine
upon
their
pathway
and
that
ethiopia
shall
yet
reach
forth
her
hand
unto
believing
that
one
of
the
best
means
of
emancipating
the
slaves
of
the
south
is
to
improve
and
elevate
the
character
of
the
free
colored
people
of
the
north
i
shall
labor
in
the
future
as
i
have
labored
in
the
past
to
promote
the
moral
social
religious
and
intellectual
elevation
of
the
free
colored
people
never
forgetting
my
own
humble
orgin
sic
nor
refusing
while
heaven
lends
me
ability
to
use
my
voice
my
pen
or
my
vote
to
advocate
the
great
and
primary
work
of
the
universal
and
unconditional
emancipation
of
my
entire
race
reception
speech
at
finsbury
chapel
moorfields
england
may
douglass
rose
amid
loud
cheers
and
said
i
feel
exceedingly
glad
of
the
opportunity
now
afforded
me
of
presenting
the
claims
of
my
brethren
in
bonds
in
the
united
states
to
so
many
in
london
and
from
various
parts
of
britain
who
have
assembled
here
on
the
present
occasion
i
have
nothing
to
commend
me
to
your
consideration
in
the
way
of
learning
nothing
in
the
way
of
education
to
entitle
me
to
your
attention
and
you
are
aware
that
slavery
is
a
very
bad
school
for
rearing
teachers
of
morality
and
religion
years
of
my
life
have
been
spent
in
slavery
personal
slavery
surrounded
by
degrading
influences
such
as
can
exist
nowhere
beyond
the
pale
of
slavery
and
it
will
not
be
strange
if
under
such
circumstances
i
should
betray
in
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
a
deficiency
of
that
refinement
which
is
seldom
or
ever
found
except
among
persons
that
have
experienced
superior
advantages
to
those
which
i
have
enjoyed
but
i
will
take
it
for
granted
that
you
know
something
about
the
degrading
influences
of
slavery
and
that
you
will
not
expect
great
things
from
me
this
evening
but
simply
such
facts
as
i
may
be
able
to
advance
immediately
in
connection
with
my
own
experience
of
slavery
now
what
is
this
system
of
slavery
this
is
the
subject
of
my
lecture
this
evening
what
is
the
character
of
this
institution
i
am
about
to
answer
the
inquiry
what
is
american
slavery
i
do
this
the
more
readily
since
i
have
found
persons
in
this
country
who
have
identified
the
term
slavery
with
that
which
i
think
it
is
not
and
in
some
instances
i
have
feared
in
so
doing
have
rather
unwittingly
i
know
detracted
much
from
the
horror
with
which
the
term
slavery
is
contemplated
it
is
common
in
this
country
to
distinguish
every
bad
thing
by
the
name
of
slavery
intemperance
is
slavery
to
be
deprived
of
the
right
to
vote
is
slavery
says
one
to
have
to
work
hard
is
slavery
says
another
and
i
do
not
know
but
that
if
we
should
let
them
go
on
they
would
say
that
to
eat
when
we
are
hungry
to
walk
when
we
desire
to
have
exercise
or
to
minister
to
our
necessities
or
have
necessities
at
all
is
slavery
i
do
not
wish
for
a
moment
to
detract
from
the
horror
with
which
the
evil
of
intemperance
is
contemplated
not
at
all
nor
do
i
wish
to
throw
the
slightest
obstruction
in
the
way
of
any
political
freedom
that
any
class
of
persons
in
this
country
may
desire
to
obtain
but
i
am
here
to
say
that
i
think
the
term
slavery
is
sometimes
abused
by
identifying
it
with
that
which
it
is
not
slavery
in
the
united
states
is
the
granting
of
that
power
by
which
one
man
exercises
and
enforces
a
right
of
property
in
the
body
and
soul
of
another
the
condition
of
a
slave
is
simply
that
of
the
brute
beast
he
is
a
piece
of
property
a
marketable
commodity
in
the
language
of
the
law
to
be
bought
or
sold
at
the
will
and
caprice
of
the
master
who
claims
him
to
be
his
property
he
is
spoken
of
thought
of
and
treated
as
property
his
own
good
his
conscience
his
intellect
his
affections
are
all
set
aside
by
the
master
the
will
and
the
wishes
of
the
master
are
the
law
of
the
slave
he
is
as
much
a
piece
of
property
as
a
horse
if
he
is
fed
he
is
fed
because
he
is
property
if
he
is
clothed
it
is
with
a
view
to
the
increase
of
his
value
as
property
whatever
of
comfort
is
necessary
to
him
for
his
body
or
soul
that
is
inconsistent
with
his
being
property
is
carefully
wrested
from
him
not
only
by
public
opinion
but
by
the
law
of
the
country
he
is
carefully
deprived
of
everything
that
tends
in
the
slightest
degree
to
detract
from
his
value
as
property
he
is
deprived
of
education
god
has
given
him
an
intellect
the
slaveholder
declares
it
shall
not
be
cultivated
if
his
moral
perception
leads
him
in
a
course
contrary
to
his
value
as
property
the
slaveholder
declares
he
shall
not
exercise
it
the
marriage
institution
can
not
exist
among
slaves
and
of
the
population
of
democratic
america
is
denied
its
privileges
by
the
law
of
the
land
what
is
to
be
thought
of
a
nation
boasting
of
its
liberty
boasting
of
its
humanity
boasting
of
its
christianity
boasting
of
its
love
of
justice
and
purity
and
yet
having
within
its
own
borders
three
millions
of
persons
denied
by
law
the
right
of
marriage
what
must
be
the
condition
of
that
people
i
need
not
lift
up
the
veil
by
giving
you
any
experience
of
my
own
every
one
that
can
put
two
ideas
together
must
see
the
most
fearful
results
from
such
a
state
of
things
as
i
have
just
mentioned
if
any
of
these
three
millions
find
for
themselves
companions
and
prove
themselves
honest
upright
virtuous
persons
to
each
other
yet
in
these
cases
few
as
i
am
bound
to
confess
they
are
the
virtuous
live
in
constant
apprehension
of
being
torn
asunder
by
the
merciless
that
claim
them
as
their
property
this
is
american
slavery
no
marriage
no
education
the
light
of
the
gospel
shut
out
from
the
dark
mind
of
the
bondman
and
he
forbidden
by
law
to
learn
to
read
if
a
mother
shall
teach
her
children
to
read
the
law
in
louisiana
proclaims
that
she
may
be
hanged
by
the
neck
if
the
father
attempt
to
give
his
son
a
knowledge
of
letters
he
may
be
punished
by
the
whip
in
one
instance
and
in
another
be
killed
at
the
discretion
of
the
court
three
millions
of
people
shut
out
from
the
light
of
knowledge
it
is
easy
for
you
to
conceive
the
evil
that
must
result
from
such
a
state
of
things
i
now
come
to
the
physical
evils
of
slavery
i
do
not
wish
to
dwell
at
length
upon
these
but
it
seems
right
to
speak
of
them
not
so
much
to
influence
your
minds
on
this
question
as
to
let
the
slaveholders
of
america
know
that
the
curtain
which
conceals
their
crimes
is
being
lifted
abroad
that
we
are
opening
the
dark
cell
and
leading
the
people
into
the
horrible
recesses
of
what
they
are
pleased
to
call
their
domestic
institution
we
want
them
to
know
that
a
knowledge
of
their
whippings
their
scourgings
their
brandings
their
chainings
is
not
confined
to
their
plantations
but
that
some
negro
of
theirs
has
broken
loose
from
his
chains
has
burst
through
the
dark
incrustation
of
slavery
and
is
now
exposing
their
deeds
of
deep
damnation
to
the
gaze
of
the
christian
people
of
england
the
slaveholders
resort
to
all
kinds
of
cruelty
if
i
were
disposed
i
have
matter
enough
to
interest
you
on
this
question
for
five
or
six
evenings
but
i
will
not
dwell
at
length
upon
these
cruelties
suffice
it
to
say
that
all
of
the
peculiar
modes
of
torture
that
were
resorted
to
in
the
west
india
islands
are
resorted
to
i
believe
even
more
frequently
in
the
united
states
of
america
starvation
the
bloody
whip
the
chain
the
gag
the
the
the
dungeon
the
are
all
in
requisition
to
keep
the
slave
in
his
condition
as
a
slave
in
the
united
states
if
any
one
has
a
doubt
upon
this
point
i
would
ask
him
to
read
the
chapter
on
slavery
in
dickens
s
on
if
any
man
has
a
doubt
upon
it
i
have
here
the
testimony
of
a
thousand
witnesses
which
i
can
give
at
any
length
all
going
to
prove
the
truth
of
my
statement
the
is
regularly
trained
in
the
united
states
and
advertisements
are
to
be
found
in
the
southern
papers
of
the
union
from
persons
advertising
themselves
as
trainers
and
offering
to
hunt
down
slaves
at
fifteen
dollars
a
piece
recommending
their
hounds
as
the
fleetest
in
the
neighborhood
never
known
to
fail
advertisements
are
from
time
to
time
inserted
stating
that
slaves
have
escaped
with
iron
collars
about
their
necks
with
bands
of
iron
about
their
feet
marked
with
the
lash
branded
with
irons
the
initials
of
their
master
s
name
burned
into
their
flesh
and
the
masters
advertise
the
fact
of
their
being
thus
branded
with
their
own
signature
thereby
proving
to
the
world
that
however
damning
it
may
appear
to
such
practices
are
not
regarded
discreditable
among
the
slaveholders
themselves
why
i
believe
if
a
man
should
brand
his
horse
in
this
country
burn
the
initials
of
his
name
into
any
of
his
cattle
and
publish
the
ferocious
deed
here
that
the
united
execrations
of
christians
in
britain
would
descend
upon
him
yet
in
the
united
states
human
beings
are
thus
branded
as
whittier
says
countrymen
in
chains
the
whip
on
woman
s
shrinking
flesh
our
soil
yet
reddening
with
the
stains
caught
from
her
scourgings
warm
and
the
boldly
publishes
his
infamous
acts
to
the
world
of
all
things
that
have
been
said
of
slavery
to
which
exception
has
been
taken
by
slaveholders
this
the
charge
of
cruelty
stands
foremost
and
yet
there
is
no
charge
capable
of
clearer
demonstration
than
that
of
the
most
barbarous
inhumanity
on
the
part
of
the
slaveholders
toward
their
slaves
and
all
this
is
necessary
it
is
necessary
to
resort
to
these
cruelties
in
order
to
the
slave
a
and
to
him
a
why
my
experience
all
goes
to
prove
the
truth
of
what
you
will
call
a
marvelous
proposition
that
the
better
you
treat
a
slave
the
more
you
destroy
his
value
a
and
enhance
the
probability
of
his
eluding
the
grasp
of
the
slaveholder
the
more
kindly
you
treat
him
the
more
wretched
you
make
him
while
you
keep
him
in
the
condition
of
a
slave
my
experience
i
say
confirms
the
truth
of
this
proposition
when
i
was
treated
exceedingly
ill
when
my
back
was
being
scourged
daily
when
i
was
whipped
within
an
inch
of
my
life
was
all
i
cared
for
spare
my
life
was
my
continual
prayer
when
i
was
looking
for
the
blow
about
to
be
inflicted
upon
my
head
i
was
not
thinking
of
my
liberty
it
was
my
life
but
as
soon
as
the
blow
was
not
to
be
feared
then
came
the
longing
for
liberty
if
a
slave
has
a
bad
master
his
ambition
is
to
get
a
better
when
he
gets
a
better
he
aspires
to
have
the
best
and
when
he
gets
the
best
he
aspires
to
be
his
own
master
but
the
slave
must
be
brutalized
to
keep
him
as
a
slave
the
slaveholder
feels
this
necessity
i
admit
this
necessity
if
it
be
right
to
hold
slaves
at
all
it
is
right
to
hold
them
in
the
only
way
in
which
they
can
be
held
and
this
can
be
done
only
by
shutting
out
the
light
of
education
from
their
minds
and
brutalizing
their
persons
the
whip
the
chain
the
gag
the
the
the
stocks
and
all
the
other
bloody
paraphernalia
of
the
slave
system
are
indispensably
necessary
to
the
relation
of
master
and
slave
the
slave
must
be
subjected
to
these
or
he
ceases
to
be
a
slave
let
him
know
that
the
whip
is
burned
that
the
fetters
have
been
turned
to
some
useful
and
profitable
employment
that
the
chain
is
no
longer
for
his
limbs
that
the
is
no
longer
to
be
put
upon
his
track
that
his
master
s
authority
over
him
is
no
longer
to
be
enforced
by
taking
his
life
and
immediately
he
walks
out
from
the
house
of
bondage
and
asserts
his
freedom
as
a
man
the
slaveholder
finds
it
necessary
to
have
these
implements
to
keep
the
slave
in
bondage
finds
it
necessary
to
be
able
to
say
unless
you
do
so
and
so
unless
you
do
as
i
bid
you
i
will
take
away
your
life
some
of
the
most
awful
scenes
of
cruelty
are
constantly
taking
place
in
the
middle
states
of
the
union
we
have
in
those
states
what
are
called
the
states
allow
me
to
speak
plainly
although
it
is
harrowing
to
your
feelings
it
is
necessary
that
the
facts
of
the
case
should
be
stated
we
have
in
the
united
states
states
the
very
state
from
which
the
minister
from
our
court
to
yours
comes
is
one
of
these
states
maryland
where
men
women
and
children
are
reared
for
the
market
just
as
horses
sheep
and
swine
are
raised
for
the
market
is
there
looked
upon
as
a
legitimate
trade
the
law
sanctions
it
public
opinion
upholds
it
the
church
does
not
condemn
it
it
goes
on
in
all
its
bloody
horrors
sustained
by
the
auctioneer
s
block
if
you
would
see
the
cruelties
of
this
system
hear
the
following
narrative
not
long
since
the
following
scene
occurred
a
and
a
slaveman
had
united
themselves
as
man
and
wife
in
the
absence
of
any
law
to
protect
them
as
man
and
wife
they
had
lived
together
by
the
permission
not
by
right
of
their
master
and
they
had
reared
a
family
the
master
found
it
expedient
and
for
his
interest
to
sell
them
he
did
not
ask
them
their
wishes
in
regard
to
the
matter
at
all
they
were
not
consulted
the
man
and
woman
were
brought
to
the
auctioneer
s
block
under
the
sound
of
the
hammer
the
cry
was
raised
here
goes
who
bids
cash
think
of
it
a
man
and
wife
to
be
sold
the
woman
was
placed
on
the
auctioneer
s
block
her
limbs
as
is
customary
were
brutally
exposed
to
the
purchasers
who
examined
her
with
all
the
freedom
with
which
they
would
examine
a
horse
there
stood
the
husband
powerless
no
right
to
his
wife
the
master
s
right
preeminent
she
was
sold
he
was
next
brought
to
the
auctioneer
s
block
his
eyes
followed
his
wife
in
the
distance
and
he
looked
beseechingly
imploringly
to
the
man
that
had
bought
his
wife
to
buy
him
also
but
he
was
at
length
bid
off
to
another
person
he
was
about
to
be
separated
forever
from
her
he
loved
no
word
of
his
no
work
of
his
could
save
him
from
this
separation
he
asked
permission
of
his
new
master
to
go
and
take
the
hand
of
his
wife
at
parting
it
was
denied
him
in
the
agony
of
his
soul
he
rushed
from
the
man
who
had
just
bought
him
that
he
might
take
a
farewell
of
his
wife
but
his
way
was
obstructed
he
was
struck
over
the
head
with
a
loaded
whip
and
was
held
for
a
moment
but
his
agony
was
too
great
when
he
was
let
go
he
fell
a
corpse
at
the
feet
of
his
master
his
heart
was
broken
such
scenes
are
the
everyday
fruits
of
american
slavery
some
two
years
since
the
hon
seth
gates
an
gentleman
of
the
state
of
new
york
a
representative
in
the
congress
of
the
united
states
told
me
he
saw
with
his
own
eyes
the
following
circumstances
in
the
national
district
of
columbia
over
which
the
emblem
is
constantly
waving
where
orators
are
ever
holding
forth
on
the
subject
of
american
liberty
american
democracy
american
republicanism
there
are
two
slave
prisons
when
going
across
a
bridge
leading
to
one
of
these
prisons
he
saw
a
young
woman
run
out
and
and
with
very
little
clothing
on
she
was
running
with
all
speed
to
the
bridge
he
was
approaching
his
eye
was
fixed
upon
her
and
he
stopped
to
see
what
was
the
matter
he
had
not
paused
long
before
he
saw
three
men
run
out
after
her
he
now
knew
what
the
nature
of
the
case
was
a
slave
escaping
from
her
chains
a
young
woman
a
sister
escaping
from
the
bondage
in
which
she
had
been
held
she
made
her
way
to
the
bridge
but
had
not
reached
ere
from
the
virginia
side
there
came
two
slaveholders
as
soon
as
they
saw
them
her
pursuers
called
out
stop
her
true
to
their
virginian
instincts
they
came
to
the
rescue
of
their
brother
kidnappers
across
the
bridge
the
poor
girl
now
saw
that
there
was
no
chance
for
her
it
was
a
trying
time
she
knew
if
she
went
back
she
must
be
a
slave
forever
she
must
be
dragged
down
to
the
scenes
of
pollution
which
the
slaveholders
continually
provide
for
most
of
the
poor
sinking
wretched
young
women
whom
they
call
their
property
she
formed
her
resolution
and
just
as
those
who
were
about
to
take
her
were
going
to
put
hands
upon
her
to
drag
her
back
she
leaped
over
the
balustrades
of
the
bridge
and
down
she
went
to
rise
no
more
she
chose
death
rather
than
to
go
back
into
the
hands
of
those
christian
slaveholders
from
whom
she
had
escaped
can
it
be
possible
that
such
things
as
these
exist
in
the
united
states
are
not
these
the
exceptions
are
any
such
scenes
as
this
general
are
not
such
deeds
condemned
by
the
law
and
denounced
by
public
opinion
let
me
read
to
you
a
few
of
the
laws
of
the
slaveholding
states
of
america
i
think
no
better
exposure
of
slavery
can
be
made
than
is
made
by
the
laws
of
the
states
in
which
slavery
exists
i
prefer
reading
the
laws
to
making
any
statement
in
confirmation
of
what
i
have
said
myself
for
the
slaveholders
can
not
object
to
this
testimony
since
it
is
the
calm
the
cool
the
deliberate
enactment
of
their
wisest
heads
of
their
most
their
own
constituted
representatives
if
more
than
seven
slaves
together
are
found
in
any
road
without
a
white
person
twenty
lashes
a
piece
for
visiting
a
plantation
without
a
written
pass
ten
lashes
for
letting
loose
a
boat
from
where
it
is
made
fast
lashes
for
the
first
offense
and
for
the
second
shall
have
cut
off
from
his
head
one
ear
for
keeping
or
carrying
a
club
lashes
for
having
any
article
for
sale
without
a
ticket
from
his
master
ten
lashes
for
traveling
in
any
other
than
the
most
usual
and
accustomed
road
when
going
alone
to
any
place
forty
lashes
for
traveling
in
the
night
without
a
pass
forty
i
am
afraid
you
do
not
understand
the
awful
character
of
these
lashes
you
must
bring
it
before
your
mind
a
human
being
in
a
perfect
state
of
nudity
tied
hand
and
foot
to
a
stake
and
a
strong
man
standing
behind
with
a
heavy
whip
knotted
at
the
end
each
blow
cutting
into
the
flesh
and
leaving
the
warm
blood
dripping
to
the
feet
and
for
these
trifles
for
being
found
in
another
person
s
forty
lashes
for
hunting
with
dogs
in
the
woods
thirty
lashes
for
being
on
horseback
without
the
written
permission
of
his
master
lashes
for
riding
or
going
abroad
in
the
night
or
riding
horses
in
the
day
time
without
leave
a
slave
may
be
whipped
cropped
or
branded
in
the
cheek
with
the
letter
or
otherwise
punished
such
punishment
not
extending
to
life
or
so
as
to
render
him
unfit
for
the
laws
referred
to
may
be
found
by
consulting
s
digest
haywood
s
manual
virginia
revised
code
prince
s
digest
missouri
laws
mississippi
revised
a
man
for
going
to
visit
his
brethren
without
the
permission
of
his
master
and
in
many
instances
he
may
not
have
that
permission
his
master
from
caprice
or
other
reasons
may
not
be
willing
to
allow
it
may
be
caught
on
his
way
dragged
to
a
post
the
heated
and
the
name
of
his
master
or
the
letter
r
branded
into
his
cheek
or
on
his
forehead
they
treat
slaves
thus
on
the
principle
that
they
must
punish
for
light
offenses
in
order
to
prevent
the
commission
of
larger
ones
i
wish
you
to
mark
that
in
the
single
state
of
virginia
there
are
crimes
for
which
a
colored
man
may
be
executed
while
there
are
only
three
of
these
crimes
which
when
committed
by
a
white
man
will
subject
him
to
that
punishment
there
are
many
of
these
crimes
which
if
the
white
man
did
not
commit
he
would
be
regarded
as
a
scoundrel
and
a
coward
in
the
state
of
maryland
there
is
a
law
to
this
effect
that
if
a
slave
shall
strike
his
master
he
may
be
hanged
his
head
severed
from
his
body
his
body
quartered
and
his
head
and
quarters
set
up
in
the
most
prominent
places
in
the
neighborhood
if
a
colored
woman
in
the
defense
of
her
own
virtue
in
defense
of
her
own
person
should
shield
herself
from
the
brutal
attacks
of
her
tyrannical
master
or
make
the
slightest
resistance
she
may
be
killed
on
the
spot
no
law
whatever
will
bring
the
guilty
man
to
justice
for
the
crime
but
you
will
ask
me
can
these
things
be
possible
in
a
land
professing
christianity
yes
they
are
so
and
this
is
not
the
worst
no
a
darker
feature
is
yet
to
be
presented
than
the
mere
existence
of
these
facts
i
have
to
inform
you
that
the
religion
of
the
southern
states
at
this
time
is
the
great
supporter
the
great
sanctioner
of
the
bloody
atrocities
to
which
i
have
referred
while
america
is
printing
tracts
and
bibles
sending
missionaries
abroad
to
convert
the
heathen
expending
her
money
in
various
ways
for
the
promotion
of
the
gospel
in
foreign
lands
the
slave
not
only
lies
forgotten
uncared
for
but
is
trampled
under
foot
by
the
very
churches
of
the
land
what
have
we
in
america
why
we
have
slavery
made
part
of
the
religion
of
the
land
yes
the
pulpit
there
stands
up
as
the
great
defender
of
this
cursed
as
it
is
called
ministers
of
religion
come
forward
and
torture
the
hallowed
pages
of
inspired
wisdom
to
sanction
the
bloody
deed
they
stand
forth
as
the
foremost
the
strongest
defenders
of
this
as
a
proof
of
this
i
need
not
do
more
than
state
the
general
fact
that
slavery
has
existed
under
the
droppings
of
the
sanctuary
of
the
south
for
the
last
two
hundred
years
and
there
has
not
been
any
war
between
the
and
the
of
the
south
whips
chains
gags
and
have
all
lain
under
the
droppings
of
the
sanctuary
and
instead
of
rusting
from
off
the
limbs
of
the
bondman
those
droppings
have
served
to
preserve
them
in
all
their
strength
instead
of
preaching
the
gospel
against
this
tyranny
rebuke
and
wrong
ministers
of
religion
have
sought
by
all
and
every
means
to
throw
in
the
whatever
in
the
bible
could
be
construed
into
opposition
to
slavery
and
to
bring
forward
that
which
they
could
torture
into
its
support
this
i
conceive
to
be
the
darkest
feature
of
slavery
and
the
most
difficult
to
attack
because
it
is
identified
with
religion
and
exposes
those
who
denounce
it
to
the
charge
of
infidelity
yes
those
with
whom
i
have
been
laboring
namely
the
old
organization
society
of
america
have
been
again
and
again
stigmatized
as
infidels
and
for
what
reason
why
solely
in
consequence
of
the
faithfulness
of
their
attacks
upon
the
slaveholding
religion
of
the
southern
states
and
the
northern
religion
that
sympathizes
with
it
i
have
found
it
difficult
to
speak
on
this
matter
without
persons
coming
forward
and
saying
douglass
are
you
not
afraid
of
injuring
the
cause
of
christ
you
do
not
desire
to
do
so
we
know
but
are
you
not
undermining
religion
this
has
been
said
to
me
again
and
again
even
since
i
came
to
this
country
but
i
can
not
be
induced
to
leave
off
these
exposures
i
love
the
religion
of
our
blessed
savior
i
love
that
religion
that
comes
from
above
in
the
wisdom
of
god
which
is
first
pure
then
peaceable
gentle
and
easy
to
be
entreated
full
of
mercy
and
good
fruits
without
partiality
and
without
hypocrisy
i
love
that
religion
that
sends
its
votaries
to
bind
up
the
wounds
of
him
that
has
fallen
among
thieves
i
love
that
religion
that
makes
it
the
duty
of
its
disciples
to
visit
the
father
less
and
the
widow
in
their
affliction
i
love
that
religion
that
is
based
upon
the
glorious
principle
of
love
to
god
and
love
to
man
which
makes
its
followers
do
unto
others
as
they
themselves
would
be
done
by
if
you
demand
liberty
to
yourself
it
says
grant
it
to
your
neighbors
if
you
claim
a
right
to
think
for
yourself
it
says
allow
your
neighbors
the
same
right
if
you
claim
to
act
for
yourself
it
says
allow
your
neighbors
the
same
right
it
is
because
i
love
this
religion
that
i
hate
the
slaveholding
the
the
the
religion
that
exists
in
the
southern
states
of
america
it
is
because
i
regard
the
one
as
good
and
pure
and
holy
that
i
can
not
but
regard
the
other
as
bad
corrupt
and
wicked
loving
the
one
i
must
hate
the
other
holding
to
the
one
i
must
reject
the
other
i
may
be
asked
why
i
am
so
anxious
to
bring
this
subject
before
the
british
public
why
i
do
not
confine
my
efforts
to
the
united
states
my
answer
is
first
that
slavery
is
the
common
enemy
of
mankind
and
all
mankind
should
be
made
acquainted
with
its
abominable
character
my
next
answer
is
that
the
slave
is
a
man
and
as
such
is
entitled
to
your
sympathy
as
a
brother
all
the
feelings
all
the
susceptibilities
all
the
capacities
which
you
have
he
has
he
is
a
part
of
the
human
family
he
has
been
the
prey
the
common
prey
of
christendom
for
the
last
three
hundred
years
and
it
is
but
right
it
is
but
just
it
is
but
proper
that
his
wrongs
should
be
known
throughout
the
world
i
have
another
reason
for
bringing
this
matter
before
the
british
public
and
it
is
this
slavery
is
a
system
of
wrong
so
blinding
to
all
around
so
hardening
to
the
heart
so
corrupting
to
the
morals
so
deleterious
to
religion
so
sapping
to
all
the
principles
of
justice
in
its
immediate
vicinity
that
the
community
surrounding
it
lack
the
moral
stamina
necessary
to
its
removal
it
is
a
system
of
such
gigantic
evil
so
strong
so
overwhelming
in
its
power
that
no
one
nation
is
equal
to
its
removal
it
requires
the
humanity
of
christianity
the
morality
of
the
world
to
remove
it
hence
i
call
upon
the
people
of
britain
to
look
at
this
matter
and
to
exert
the
influence
i
am
about
to
show
they
possess
for
the
removal
of
slavery
from
america
i
can
appeal
to
them
as
strongly
by
their
regard
for
the
slaveholder
as
for
the
slave
to
labor
in
this
cause
i
am
here
because
you
have
an
influence
on
america
that
no
other
nation
can
have
you
have
been
drawn
together
by
the
power
of
steam
to
a
marvelous
extent
the
distance
between
london
and
boston
is
now
reduced
to
some
twelve
or
fourteen
days
so
that
the
denunciations
against
slavery
uttered
in
london
this
week
may
be
heard
in
a
fortnight
in
the
streets
of
boston
and
reverberating
amidst
the
hills
of
massachusetts
there
is
nothing
said
here
against
slavery
that
will
not
be
recorded
in
the
united
states
i
am
here
also
because
the
slaveholders
do
not
want
me
to
be
here
they
would
rather
that
i
were
not
here
i
have
adopted
a
maxim
laid
down
by
napoleon
never
to
occupy
ground
which
the
enemy
would
like
me
to
occupy
the
slaveholders
would
much
rather
have
me
if
i
will
denounce
slavery
denounce
it
in
the
northern
states
where
their
friends
and
supporters
are
who
will
stand
by
and
mob
me
for
denouncing
it
they
feel
something
as
the
man
felt
when
he
uttered
his
prayer
in
which
he
made
out
a
most
horrible
case
for
himself
and
one
of
his
neighbors
touched
him
and
said
my
friend
i
always
had
the
opinion
of
you
that
you
have
now
expressed
for
yourself
that
you
are
a
very
great
coming
from
himself
it
was
all
very
well
but
coming
from
a
stranger
it
was
rather
cutting
the
slaveholders
felt
that
when
slavery
was
denounced
among
themselves
it
was
not
so
bad
but
let
one
of
the
slaves
get
loose
let
him
summon
the
people
of
britain
and
make
known
to
them
the
conduct
of
the
slaveholders
toward
their
slaves
and
it
cuts
them
to
the
quick
and
produces
a
sensation
such
as
would
be
produced
by
nothing
else
the
power
i
exert
now
is
something
like
the
power
that
is
exerted
by
the
man
at
the
end
of
the
lever
my
influence
now
is
just
in
proportion
to
the
distance
that
i
am
from
the
united
states
my
exposure
of
slavery
abroad
will
tell
more
upon
the
hearts
and
consciences
of
slaveholders
than
if
i
was
attacking
them
in
america
for
almost
every
paper
that
i
now
receive
from
the
united
states
comes
teeming
with
statements
about
this
fugitive
negro
calling
him
a
scoundrel
and
saying
that
he
is
running
out
against
the
institutions
and
people
of
america
i
deny
the
charge
that
i
am
saying
a
word
against
the
institutions
of
america
or
the
people
as
such
what
i
have
to
say
is
against
slavery
and
slaveholders
i
feel
at
liberty
to
speak
on
this
subject
i
have
on
my
back
the
marks
of
the
lash
i
have
four
sisters
and
one
brother
now
under
the
galling
chain
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
cry
aloud
and
spare
not
i
am
not
averse
to
having
the
good
opinion
of
my
fellow
creatures
i
am
not
averse
to
being
kindly
regarded
by
all
men
but
i
am
bound
even
at
the
hazard
of
making
a
large
class
of
religionists
in
this
country
hate
me
oppose
me
and
malign
me
as
they
have
done
i
am
bound
by
the
prayers
and
tears
and
entreaties
of
three
millions
of
kneeling
bondsmen
to
have
no
compromise
with
men
who
are
in
any
shape
or
form
connected
with
the
slaveholders
of
america
i
expose
slavery
in
this
country
because
to
expose
it
is
to
kill
it
slavery
is
one
of
those
monsters
of
darkness
to
whom
the
light
of
truth
is
death
expose
slavery
and
it
dies
light
is
to
slavery
what
the
heat
of
the
sun
is
to
the
root
of
a
tree
it
must
die
under
it
all
the
slaveholder
asks
of
me
is
silence
he
does
not
ask
me
to
go
abroad
and
preach
of
slavery
he
does
not
ask
any
one
to
do
that
he
would
not
say
that
slavery
is
a
good
thing
but
the
best
under
the
circumstances
the
slaveholders
want
total
darkness
on
the
subject
they
want
the
hatchway
shut
down
that
the
monster
may
crawl
in
his
den
of
darkness
crushing
human
hopes
and
happiness
destroying
the
bondman
at
will
and
having
no
one
to
reprove
or
rebuke
him
slavery
shrinks
from
the
light
it
hateth
the
light
neither
cometh
to
the
light
lest
its
deeds
should
be
reproved
to
tear
off
the
mask
from
this
abominable
system
to
expose
it
to
the
light
of
heaven
aye
to
the
heat
of
the
sun
that
it
may
burn
and
wither
it
out
of
existence
is
my
object
in
coming
to
this
country
i
want
the
slaveholder
surrounded
as
by
a
wall
of
fire
so
that
he
may
see
the
condemnation
of
himself
and
his
system
glaring
down
in
letters
of
light
i
want
him
to
feel
that
he
has
no
sympathy
in
england
scotland
or
ireland
that
he
has
none
in
canada
none
in
mexico
none
among
the
poor
wild
indians
that
the
voice
of
the
civilized
aye
and
savage
world
is
against
him
i
would
have
condemnation
blaze
down
upon
him
in
every
direction
till
stunned
and
overwhelmed
with
shame
and
confusion
he
is
compelled
to
let
go
the
grasp
he
holds
upon
the
persons
of
his
victims
and
restore
them
to
their
rights
campbell
s
reply
from
rev
campbell
s
brilliant
reply
we
extract
the
following
frederick
douglass
the
beast
of
burden
the
portion
of
goods
and
chattels
the
representative
of
three
millions
of
men
has
been
raised
up
shall
i
say
the
if
there
is
a
man
on
earth
he
is
a
man
my
blood
boiled
within
me
when
i
heard
his
address
tonight
and
thought
that
he
had
left
behind
him
three
millions
of
such
men
we
must
see
more
of
this
man
we
must
have
more
of
this
man
one
would
have
taken
a
voyage
round
the
globe
some
forty
years
back
especially
since
the
introduction
of
steam
to
have
heard
such
an
exposure
of
slavery
from
the
lips
of
a
slave
it
will
be
an
era
in
the
individual
history
of
the
present
assembly
our
children
our
boys
and
girls
i
have
tonight
seen
the
delightful
sympathy
of
their
hearts
evinced
by
their
heaving
breasts
while
their
eyes
sparkled
with
wonder
and
admiration
that
this
black
man
this
slave
had
so
much
logic
so
much
wit
so
much
fancy
so
much
eloquence
he
was
something
more
than
a
man
according
to
their
little
notions
then
i
say
we
must
hear
him
again
we
have
got
a
purpose
to
accomplish
he
has
appealed
to
the
pulpit
of
england
the
english
pulpit
is
with
him
he
has
appealed
to
the
press
of
england
the
press
of
england
is
conducted
by
english
hearts
and
that
press
will
do
him
justice
about
ten
days
hence
and
his
second
master
who
may
well
prize
such
a
piece
of
goods
will
have
the
pleasure
of
reading
his
burning
words
and
his
first
master
will
bless
himself
that
he
has
got
quit
of
him
we
have
to
create
public
opinion
or
rather
not
to
create
it
for
it
is
created
already
but
we
have
to
foster
it
and
when
tonight
i
heard
those
magnificent
words
the
words
of
curran
by
which
my
heart
from
boyhood
has
ofttimes
been
deeply
moved
i
rejoice
to
think
that
they
embody
an
instinct
of
an
englishman
s
nature
i
heard
with
inexpressible
delight
how
they
told
on
this
mighty
mass
of
the
citizens
of
the
metropolis
britain
has
now
no
slaves
we
can
therefore
talk
to
the
other
nations
now
as
we
could
not
have
talked
a
dozen
years
ago
i
want
the
whole
of
the
london
ministry
to
meet
douglass
for
as
his
appeal
is
to
england
and
throughout
england
i
should
rejoice
in
the
idea
of
churchmen
and
dissenters
merging
all
sectional
distinctions
in
this
cause
let
us
have
a
public
breakfast
let
the
ministers
meet
him
let
them
hear
him
let
them
grasp
his
hand
and
let
him
enlist
their
sympathies
on
behalf
of
the
slave
let
him
inspire
them
with
abhorrence
of
the
the
slaveholder
no
slaveholding
american
shall
ever
my
cross
my
door
no
slaveholding
or
minister
shall
ever
pollute
my
pulpit
while
i
have
a
tongue
to
speak
or
a
hand
to
write
i
will
to
the
utmost
of
my
power
oppose
these
slaveholding
men
we
must
have
douglass
amongst
us
to
aid
in
fostering
public
opinion
the
great
conflict
with
slavery
must
now
take
place
in
america
and
while
they
are
adding
other
slave
states
to
the
union
our
business
is
to
step
forward
and
help
the
abolitionists
there
it
is
a
pleasing
circumstance
that
such
a
body
of
men
has
risen
in
america
and
whilst
we
hurl
our
thunders
against
her
slavers
let
us
make
a
distinction
between
those
who
advocate
slavery
and
those
who
oppose
it
george
thompson
has
been
there
this
man
frederick
douglass
has
been
there
and
has
been
compelled
to
flee
i
wish
when
he
first
set
foot
on
our
shores
he
had
made
a
solemn
vow
and
said
now
that
i
am
free
and
in
the
sanctuary
of
freedom
i
will
never
return
till
i
have
seen
the
emancipation
of
my
country
he
wants
to
surround
these
men
the
slaveholders
as
by
a
wall
of
fire
and
he
himself
may
do
much
toward
kindling
it
let
him
travel
over
the
island
east
west
north
and
south
everywhere
diffusing
knowledge
and
awakening
principle
till
the
whole
nation
become
a
body
of
petitioners
to
america
he
will
he
must
do
it
he
must
for
a
season
make
england
his
home
he
must
send
for
his
wife
he
must
send
for
his
children
i
want
to
see
the
sons
and
daughters
of
such
a
sire
we
too
must
do
something
for
him
and
them
worthy
of
the
english
name
i
do
not
like
the
idea
of
a
man
of
such
mental
dimensions
such
moral
courage
and
all
but
incomparable
talent
having
his
own
small
wants
and
the
wants
of
a
distant
wife
and
children
supplied
by
the
poor
profits
of
his
publication
the
sketch
of
his
life
let
the
pamphlet
be
bought
by
tens
of
thousands
but
we
will
do
something
more
for
him
shall
we
not
it
only
remains
that
we
pass
a
resolution
of
thanks
to
frederick
douglass
the
slave
that
was
the
man
that
is
he
that
was
covered
with
chains
and
that
is
now
being
covered
with
glory
and
whom
we
will
send
back
a
gentleman
letter
to
his
old
master
to
my
old
master
thomas
auld
sir
the
long
and
intimate
though
by
no
means
friendly
relation
which
unhappily
subsisted
between
you
and
myself
leads
me
to
hope
that
you
will
easily
account
for
the
great
liberty
which
i
now
take
in
addressing
you
in
this
open
and
public
manner
the
same
fact
may
remove
any
disagreeable
surprise
which
you
may
experience
on
again
finding
your
name
coupled
with
mine
in
any
other
way
than
in
an
advertisement
accurately
describing
my
person
and
offering
a
large
sum
for
my
arrest
in
thus
dragging
you
again
before
the
public
i
am
aware
that
i
shall
subject
myself
to
no
inconsiderable
amount
of
censure
i
shall
probably
be
charged
with
an
unwarrantable
if
not
a
wanton
and
reckless
disregard
of
the
rights
and
properties
of
private
life
there
are
those
north
as
well
as
south
who
entertain
a
much
higher
respect
for
rights
which
are
merely
conventional
than
they
do
for
rights
which
are
personal
and
essential
not
a
few
there
are
in
our
country
who
while
they
have
no
scruples
against
robbing
the
laborer
of
the
hard
earned
results
of
his
patient
industry
will
be
shocked
by
the
extremely
indelicate
manner
of
bringing
your
name
before
the
public
believing
this
to
be
the
case
and
wishing
to
meet
every
reasonable
or
plausible
objection
to
my
conduct
i
will
frankly
state
the
ground
upon
which
i
justfy
sic
myself
in
this
instance
as
well
as
on
former
occasions
when
i
have
thought
proper
to
mention
your
name
in
public
all
will
agree
that
a
man
guilty
of
theft
robbery
or
murder
has
forfeited
the
right
to
concealment
and
private
life
that
the
community
have
a
right
to
subject
such
persons
to
the
most
complete
exposure
however
much
they
may
desire
retirement
and
aim
to
conceal
themselves
and
their
movements
from
the
popular
gaze
the
public
have
a
right
to
ferret
them
out
and
bring
their
conduct
before
the
proper
tribunals
of
the
country
for
investigation
sir
you
will
undoubtedly
make
the
proper
application
of
these
generally
admitted
principles
and
will
easily
see
the
light
in
which
you
are
regarded
by
me
i
will
not
therefore
manifest
ill
temper
by
calling
you
hard
names
i
know
you
to
be
a
man
of
some
intelligence
and
can
readily
determine
the
precise
estimate
which
i
entertain
of
your
character
i
may
therefore
indulge
in
language
which
may
seem
to
others
indirect
and
ambiguous
and
yet
be
quite
well
understood
by
yourself
i
have
selected
this
day
on
which
to
address
you
because
it
is
the
anniversary
of
my
emancipation
and
knowing
no
better
way
i
am
led
to
this
as
the
best
mode
of
celebrating
that
truly
important
events
just
ten
years
ago
this
beautiful
september
morning
yon
bright
sun
beheld
me
a
slave
a
poor
degraded
chattel
trembling
at
the
sound
of
your
voice
lamenting
that
i
was
a
man
and
wishing
myself
a
brute
the
hopes
which
i
had
treasured
up
for
weeks
of
a
safe
and
successful
escape
from
your
grasp
were
powerfully
confronted
at
this
last
hour
by
dark
clouds
of
doubt
and
fear
making
my
person
shake
and
my
bosom
to
heave
with
the
heavy
contest
between
hope
and
fear
i
have
no
words
to
describe
to
you
the
deep
agony
of
soul
which
i
experienced
on
that
morning
for
i
left
by
daylight
i
was
making
a
leap
in
the
dark
the
probabilities
so
far
as
i
could
by
reason
determine
them
were
stoutly
against
the
undertaking
the
preliminaries
and
precautions
i
had
adopted
previously
all
worked
badly
i
was
like
one
going
to
war
without
weapons
ten
chances
of
defeat
to
one
of
victory
one
in
whom
i
had
confided
and
one
who
had
promised
me
assistance
appalled
by
fear
at
the
trial
hour
deserted
me
thus
leaving
the
responsibility
of
success
or
failure
solely
with
myself
you
sir
can
never
know
my
feelings
as
i
look
back
to
them
i
can
scarcely
realize
that
i
have
passed
through
a
scene
so
trying
trying
however
as
they
were
and
gloomy
as
was
the
prospect
thanks
be
to
the
most
high
who
is
ever
the
god
of
the
oppressed
at
the
moment
which
was
to
determine
my
whole
earthly
career
his
grace
was
sufficient
my
mind
was
made
up
i
embraced
the
golden
opportunity
took
the
morning
tide
at
the
flood
and
a
free
man
young
active
and
strong
is
the
result
i
have
often
thought
i
should
like
to
explain
to
you
the
grounds
upon
which
i
have
justified
myself
in
running
away
from
you
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
do
so
now
for
by
this
time
you
may
have
discovered
them
yourself
i
will
however
glance
at
them
when
yet
but
a
child
about
six
years
old
i
imbibed
the
determination
to
run
away
the
very
first
mental
effort
that
i
now
remember
on
my
part
was
an
attempt
to
solve
the
mystery
why
am
i
a
slave
and
with
this
question
my
youthful
mind
was
troubled
for
many
days
pressing
upon
me
more
heavily
at
times
than
others
when
i
saw
the
whip
a
cut
the
blood
out
of
her
neck
and
heard
her
piteous
cries
i
went
away
into
the
corner
of
the
fence
wept
and
pondered
over
the
mystery
i
had
through
some
medium
i
know
not
what
got
some
idea
of
god
the
creator
of
all
mankind
the
black
and
the
white
and
that
he
had
made
the
blacks
to
serve
the
whites
as
slaves
how
he
could
do
this
and
be
i
could
not
tell
i
was
not
satisfied
with
this
theory
which
made
god
responsible
for
slavery
for
it
pained
me
greatly
and
i
have
wept
over
it
long
and
often
at
one
time
your
first
wife
lucretia
heard
me
sighing
and
saw
me
shedding
tears
and
asked
of
me
the
matter
but
i
was
afraid
to
tell
her
i
was
puzzled
with
this
question
till
one
night
while
sitting
in
the
kitchen
i
heard
some
of
the
old
slaves
talking
of
their
parents
having
been
stolen
from
africa
by
white
men
and
were
sold
here
as
slaves
the
whole
mystery
was
solved
at
once
very
soon
after
this
my
aunt
jinny
and
uncle
noah
ran
away
and
the
great
noise
made
about
it
by
your
made
me
for
the
first
time
acquainted
with
the
fact
that
there
were
free
states
as
well
as
slave
states
from
that
time
i
resolved
that
i
would
some
day
run
away
the
morality
of
the
act
i
dispose
of
as
follows
i
am
myself
you
are
yourself
we
are
two
distinct
persons
equal
persons
what
you
are
i
am
you
are
a
man
and
so
am
i
god
created
both
and
made
us
separate
beings
i
am
not
by
nature
bond
to
you
or
you
to
me
nature
does
not
make
your
existence
depend
upon
me
or
mine
to
depend
upon
yours
i
can
not
walk
upon
your
legs
or
you
upon
mine
i
can
not
breathe
for
you
or
you
for
me
i
must
breathe
for
myself
and
you
for
yourself
we
are
distinct
persons
and
are
each
equally
provided
with
faculties
necessary
to
our
individual
existence
in
leaving
you
i
took
nothing
but
what
belonged
to
me
and
in
no
way
lessened
your
means
for
obtaining
an
living
your
faculties
remained
yours
and
mine
became
useful
to
their
rightful
owner
i
therefore
see
no
wrong
in
any
part
of
the
transaction
it
is
true
i
went
off
secretly
but
that
was
more
your
fault
than
mine
had
i
let
you
into
the
secret
you
would
have
defeated
the
enterprise
entirely
but
for
this
i
should
have
been
really
glad
to
have
made
you
acquainted
with
my
intentions
to
leave
you
may
perhaps
want
to
know
how
i
like
my
present
condition
i
am
free
to
say
i
greatly
prefer
it
to
that
which
i
occupied
in
maryland
i
am
however
by
no
means
prejudiced
against
the
state
as
such
its
geography
climate
fertility
and
products
are
such
as
to
make
it
a
very
desirable
abode
for
any
man
and
but
for
the
existence
of
slavery
there
it
is
not
impossible
that
i
might
again
take
up
my
abode
in
that
state
it
is
not
that
i
love
maryland
less
but
freedom
more
you
will
be
surprised
to
learn
that
people
at
the
north
labor
under
the
strange
delusion
that
if
the
slaves
were
emancipated
at
the
south
they
would
flock
to
the
north
so
far
from
this
being
the
case
in
that
event
you
would
see
many
old
and
familiar
faces
back
again
to
the
south
the
fact
is
there
are
few
here
who
would
not
return
to
the
south
in
the
event
of
emancipation
we
want
to
live
in
the
land
of
our
birth
and
to
lay
our
bones
by
the
side
of
our
fathers
and
nothing
short
of
an
intense
love
of
personal
freedom
keeps
us
from
the
south
for
the
sake
of
this
most
of
us
would
live
on
a
crust
of
bread
and
a
cup
of
cold
water
since
i
left
you
i
have
had
a
rich
experience
i
have
occupied
stations
which
i
never
dreamed
of
when
a
slave
three
out
of
the
ten
years
since
i
left
you
i
spent
as
a
common
laborer
on
the
wharves
of
new
bedford
massachusetts
it
was
there
i
earned
my
first
free
dollar
it
was
mine
i
could
spend
it
as
i
pleased
i
could
buy
hams
or
herring
with
it
without
asking
any
odds
of
anybody
that
was
a
precious
dollar
to
me
you
remember
when
i
used
to
make
seven
or
eight
or
even
nine
dollars
a
week
in
baltimore
you
would
take
every
cent
of
it
from
me
every
saturday
night
saying
that
i
belonged
to
you
and
my
earnings
also
i
never
liked
this
conduct
on
your
part
to
say
the
best
i
thought
it
a
little
mean
i
would
not
have
served
you
so
but
let
that
pass
i
was
a
little
awkward
about
counting
money
in
new
england
fashion
when
i
first
landed
in
new
bedford
i
came
near
betraying
myself
several
times
i
caught
myself
saying
phip
for
fourpence
and
at
one
time
a
man
actually
charged
me
with
being
a
runaway
whereupon
i
was
silly
enough
to
become
one
by
running
away
from
him
for
i
was
greatly
afraid
he
might
adopt
measures
to
get
me
again
into
slavery
a
condition
i
then
dreaded
more
than
death
i
soon
learned
however
to
count
money
as
well
as
to
make
it
and
got
on
swimmingly
i
married
soon
after
leaving
you
in
fact
i
was
engaged
to
be
married
before
i
left
you
and
instead
of
finding
my
companion
a
burden
she
was
truly
a
helpmate
she
went
to
live
at
service
and
i
to
work
on
the
wharf
and
though
we
toiled
hard
the
first
winter
we
never
lived
more
happily
after
remaining
in
new
bedford
for
three
years
i
met
with
william
lloyd
garrison
a
person
of
whom
you
have
heard
as
he
is
pretty
generally
known
among
slaveholders
he
put
it
into
my
head
that
i
might
make
myself
serviceable
to
the
cause
of
the
slave
by
devoting
a
portion
of
my
time
to
telling
my
own
sorrows
and
those
of
other
slaves
which
had
come
under
my
observation
this
was
the
commencement
of
a
higher
state
of
existence
than
any
to
which
i
had
ever
aspired
i
was
thrown
into
society
the
most
pure
enlightened
and
benevolent
that
the
country
affords
among
these
i
have
never
forgotten
you
but
have
invariably
made
you
the
topic
of
conversation
thus
giving
you
all
the
notoriety
i
could
do
i
need
not
tell
you
that
the
opinion
formed
of
you
in
these
circles
is
far
from
being
favorable
they
have
little
respect
for
your
honesty
and
less
for
your
religion
but
i
was
going
on
to
relate
to
you
something
of
my
interesting
experience
i
had
not
long
enjoyed
the
excellent
society
to
which
i
have
referred
before
the
light
of
its
excellence
exerted
a
beneficial
influence
on
my
mind
and
heart
much
of
my
early
dislike
of
white
persons
was
removed
and
their
manners
habits
and
customs
so
entirely
unlike
what
i
had
been
used
to
in
the
on
the
plantations
of
the
south
fairly
charmed
me
and
gave
me
a
strong
disrelish
for
the
coarse
and
degrading
customs
of
my
former
condition
i
therefore
made
an
effort
so
to
improve
my
mind
and
deportment
as
to
be
somewhat
fitted
to
the
station
to
which
i
seemed
almost
providentially
called
the
transition
from
degradation
to
respectability
was
indeed
great
and
to
get
from
one
to
the
other
without
carrying
some
marks
of
one
s
former
condition
is
truly
a
difficult
matter
i
would
not
have
you
think
that
i
am
now
entirely
clear
of
all
plantation
peculiarities
but
my
friends
here
while
they
entertain
the
strongest
dislike
to
them
regard
me
with
that
charity
to
which
my
past
life
somewhat
entitles
me
so
that
my
condition
in
this
respect
is
exceedingly
pleasant
so
far
as
my
domestic
affairs
are
concerned
i
can
boast
of
as
comfortable
a
dwelling
as
your
own
i
have
an
industrious
and
neat
companion
and
four
dear
children
the
oldest
a
girl
of
nine
years
and
three
fine
boys
the
oldest
eight
the
next
six
and
the
youngest
four
years
old
the
three
oldest
are
now
going
regularly
to
school
two
can
read
and
write
and
the
other
can
spell
with
tolerable
correctness
words
of
two
syllables
dear
fellows
they
are
all
in
comfortable
beds
and
are
sound
asleep
perfectly
secure
under
my
own
roof
there
are
no
slaveholders
here
to
rend
my
heart
by
snatching
them
from
my
arms
or
blast
a
mother
s
dearest
hopes
by
tearing
them
from
her
bosom
these
dear
children
are
ours
not
to
work
up
into
rice
sugar
and
tobacco
but
to
watch
over
regard
and
protect
and
to
rear
them
up
in
the
nurture
and
admonition
of
the
gospel
to
train
them
up
in
the
paths
of
wisdom
and
virtue
and
as
far
as
we
can
to
make
them
useful
to
the
world
and
to
themselves
oh
sir
a
slaveholder
never
appears
to
me
so
completely
an
agent
of
hell
as
when
i
think
of
and
look
upon
my
dear
children
it
is
then
that
my
feelings
rise
above
my
control
i
meant
to
have
said
more
with
respect
to
my
own
prosperity
and
happiness
but
thoughts
and
feel
ings
which
this
recital
has
quickened
unfit
me
to
proceed
further
in
that
direction
the
grim
horrors
of
slavery
rise
in
all
their
ghastly
terror
before
me
the
wails
of
millions
pierce
my
heart
and
chill
my
blood
i
remember
the
chain
the
gag
the
bloody
whip
the
gloom
overshadowing
the
broken
spirit
of
the
fettered
bondman
the
appalling
liability
of
his
being
torn
away
from
wife
and
children
and
sold
like
a
beast
in
the
market
say
not
that
this
is
a
picture
of
fancy
you
well
know
that
i
wear
stripes
on
my
back
inflicted
by
your
direction
and
that
you
while
we
were
brothers
in
the
same
church
caused
this
right
hand
with
which
i
am
now
penning
this
letter
to
be
closely
tied
to
my
left
and
my
person
dragged
at
the
pistol
s
mouth
fifteen
miles
from
the
bay
side
to
easton
to
be
sold
like
a
beast
in
the
market
for
the
alleged
crime
of
intending
to
escape
from
your
possession
all
this
and
more
you
remember
and
know
to
be
perfectly
true
not
only
of
yourself
but
of
nearly
all
of
the
slaveholders
around
you
at
this
moment
you
are
probably
the
guilty
holder
of
at
least
three
of
my
own
dear
sisters
and
my
only
brother
in
bondage
these
you
regard
as
your
property
they
are
recorded
on
your
ledger
or
perhaps
have
been
sold
to
human
with
a
view
to
filling
our
own
purse
sir
i
desire
to
know
how
and
where
these
dear
sisters
are
have
you
sold
them
or
are
they
still
in
your
possession
what
has
become
of
them
are
they
living
or
dead
and
my
dear
old
grandmother
whom
you
turned
out
like
an
old
horse
to
die
in
the
woods
is
she
still
alive
write
and
let
me
know
all
about
them
if
my
grandmother
be
still
alive
she
is
of
no
service
to
you
for
by
this
time
she
must
be
nearly
eighty
years
old
too
old
to
be
cared
for
by
one
to
whom
she
has
ceased
to
be
of
service
send
her
to
me
at
rochester
or
bring
her
to
philadelphia
and
it
shall
be
the
crowning
happiness
of
my
life
to
take
care
of
her
in
her
old
age
oh
she
was
to
me
a
mother
and
a
father
so
far
as
hard
toil
for
my
comfort
could
make
her
such
send
me
my
grandmother
that
i
may
watch
over
and
take
care
of
her
in
her
old
age
and
my
sisters
let
me
know
all
about
them
i
would
write
to
them
and
learn
all
i
want
to
know
of
them
without
disturbing
you
in
any
way
but
that
through
your
unrighteous
conduct
they
have
been
entirely
deprived
of
the
power
to
read
and
write
you
have
kept
them
in
utter
ignorance
and
have
therefore
robbed
them
of
the
sweet
enjoyments
of
writing
or
receiving
letters
from
absent
friends
and
relatives
your
wickedness
and
cruelty
committed
in
this
respect
on
your
are
greater
than
all
the
stripes
you
have
laid
upon
my
back
or
theirs
it
is
an
outrage
upon
the
soul
a
war
upon
the
immortal
spirit
and
one
for
which
you
must
give
account
at
the
bar
of
our
common
father
and
creator
the
responsibility
which
you
have
assumed
in
this
regard
is
truly
awful
and
how
you
could
stagger
under
it
these
many
years
is
marvelous
your
mind
must
have
become
darkened
your
heart
hardened
your
conscience
seared
and
petrified
or
you
would
have
long
since
thrown
off
the
accursed
load
and
sought
relief
at
the
hands
of
a
god
how
let
me
ask
would
you
look
upon
me
were
i
some
dark
night
in
company
with
a
band
of
hardened
villains
to
enter
the
precincts
of
your
elegant
dwelling
and
seize
the
person
of
your
own
lovely
daughter
amanda
and
carry
her
off
from
your
family
friends
and
all
the
loved
ones
of
her
youth
make
her
my
slave
compel
her
to
work
and
i
take
her
wages
place
her
name
on
my
ledger
as
property
disregard
her
personal
rights
fetter
the
powers
of
her
immortal
soul
by
denying
her
the
right
and
privilege
of
learning
to
read
and
write
feed
her
coarsely
clothe
her
scantily
and
whip
her
on
the
naked
back
occasionally
more
and
still
more
horrible
leave
her
unprotected
a
degraded
victim
to
the
brutal
lust
of
fiendish
overseers
who
would
pollute
blight
and
blast
her
fair
soul
rob
her
of
all
dignity
destroy
her
virtue
and
annihilate
in
her
person
all
the
graces
that
adorn
the
character
of
virtuous
womanhood
i
ask
how
would
you
regard
me
if
such
were
my
conduct
oh
the
vocabulary
of
the
damned
would
not
afford
a
word
sufficiently
infernal
to
express
your
idea
of
my
wickedness
yet
sir
your
treatment
of
my
beloved
sisters
is
in
all
essential
points
precisely
like
the
case
i
have
now
supposed
damning
as
would
be
such
a
deed
on
my
part
it
would
be
no
more
so
than
that
which
you
have
committed
against
me
and
my
sisters
i
will
now
bring
this
letter
to
a
close
you
shall
hear
from
me
again
unless
you
let
me
hear
from
you
i
intend
to
make
use
of
you
as
a
weapon
with
which
to
assail
the
system
of
slavery
as
a
means
of
concentrating
public
attention
on
the
system
and
deepening
the
horror
of
trafficking
in
the
souls
and
bodies
of
men
i
shall
make
use
of
you
as
a
means
of
exposing
the
character
of
the
american
church
and
clergy
and
as
a
means
of
bringing
this
guilty
nation
with
yourself
to
repentance
in
doing
this
i
entertain
no
malice
toward
you
personally
there
is
no
roof
under
which
you
would
be
more
safe
than
mine
and
there
is
nothing
in
my
house
which
you
might
need
for
your
comfort
which
i
would
not
readily
grant
indeed
i
should
esteem
it
a
privilege
to
set
you
an
example
as
to
how
mankind
ought
to
treat
each
other
am
your
but
not
your
the
nature
of
slavery
extract
from
a
lecture
on
slavery
at
rochester
december
more
than
twenty
years
of
my
life
were
consumed
in
a
state
of
slavery
my
childhood
was
environed
by
the
baneful
peculiarities
of
the
slave
system
i
grew
up
to
manhood
in
the
presence
of
this
hydra
headed
monster
not
as
a
master
not
as
an
idle
spectator
not
as
the
guest
of
the
slaveholder
but
as
a
slave
eating
the
bread
and
drinking
the
cup
of
slavery
with
the
most
degraded
of
my
and
sharing
with
them
all
the
painful
conditions
of
their
wretched
lot
in
consideration
of
these
facts
i
feel
that
i
have
a
right
to
speak
and
to
speak
yet
my
friends
i
feel
bound
to
speak
truly
goading
as
have
been
the
cruelties
to
which
i
have
been
subjected
bitter
as
have
been
the
trials
through
which
i
have
passed
exasperating
as
have
been
and
still
are
the
indignities
offered
to
my
manhood
i
find
in
them
no
excuse
for
the
slightest
departure
from
truth
in
dealing
with
any
branch
of
this
subject
first
of
all
i
will
state
as
well
as
i
can
the
legal
and
social
relation
of
master
and
slave
a
master
is
one
to
speak
in
the
vocabulary
of
the
southern
states
who
claims
and
exercises
a
right
of
property
in
the
person
of
a
this
he
does
with
the
force
of
the
law
and
the
sanction
of
southern
religion
the
law
gives
the
master
absolute
power
over
the
slave
he
may
work
him
flog
him
hire
him
out
sell
him
and
in
certain
contingencies
him
with
perfect
impunity
the
slave
is
a
human
being
divested
of
all
rights
reduced
to
the
level
of
a
brute
a
mere
chattel
in
the
eye
of
the
law
placed
beyond
the
circle
of
human
brotherhood
cut
off
from
his
kind
his
name
which
the
recording
angel
may
have
enrolled
in
heaven
among
the
blest
is
impiously
inserted
in
a
s
with
horses
sheep
and
swine
in
law
the
slave
has
no
wife
no
children
no
country
and
no
home
he
can
own
nothing
possess
nothing
acquire
nothing
but
what
must
belong
to
another
to
eat
the
fruit
of
his
own
toil
to
clothe
his
person
with
the
work
of
his
own
hands
is
considered
stealing
he
toils
that
another
may
reap
the
fruit
he
is
industrious
that
another
may
live
in
idleness
he
eats
unbolted
meal
that
another
may
eat
the
bread
of
fine
flour
he
labors
in
chains
at
home
under
a
burning
sun
and
biting
lash
that
another
may
ride
in
ease
and
splendor
abroad
he
lives
in
ignorance
that
another
may
be
educated
he
is
abused
that
another
may
be
exalted
he
rests
his
limbs
on
the
cold
damp
ground
that
another
may
repose
on
the
softest
pillow
he
is
clad
in
coarse
and
tattered
raiment
that
another
may
be
arrayed
in
purple
and
fine
linen
he
is
sheltered
only
by
the
wretched
hovel
that
a
master
may
dwell
in
a
magnificent
mansion
and
to
this
condition
he
is
bound
down
as
by
an
arm
of
iron
from
this
monstrous
relation
there
springs
an
unceasing
stream
of
most
revolting
cruelties
the
very
accompaniments
of
the
slave
system
stamp
it
as
the
offspring
of
hell
itself
to
ensure
good
behavior
the
slaveholder
relies
on
the
whip
to
induce
proper
humility
he
relies
on
the
whip
to
rebuke
what
he
is
pleased
to
term
insolence
he
relies
on
the
whip
to
supply
the
place
of
wages
as
an
incentive
to
toil
he
relies
on
the
whip
to
bind
down
the
spirit
of
the
slave
to
imbrute
and
destroy
his
manhood
he
relies
on
the
whip
the
chain
the
gag
the
the
pillory
the
bowie
knife
the
pistol
and
the
these
are
the
necessary
and
unvarying
accompaniments
of
the
system
wherever
slavery
is
found
these
horrid
instruments
are
also
found
whether
on
the
coast
of
africa
among
the
savage
tribes
or
in
south
carolina
among
the
refined
and
civilized
slavery
is
the
same
and
its
accompaniments
one
and
the
same
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
slaveholder
worships
the
god
of
the
christians
or
is
a
follower
of
mahomet
he
is
the
minister
of
the
same
cruelty
and
the
author
of
the
same
misery
is
always
always
the
same
foul
haggard
and
damning
scourge
whether
found
in
the
eastern
or
in
the
western
hemisphere
there
is
a
still
deeper
shade
to
be
given
to
this
picture
the
physical
cruelties
are
indeed
sufficiently
harassing
and
revolting
but
they
are
as
a
few
grains
of
sand
on
the
sea
shore
or
a
few
drops
of
water
in
the
great
ocean
compared
with
the
stupendous
wrongs
which
it
inflicts
upon
the
mental
moral
and
religious
nature
of
its
hapless
victims
it
is
only
when
we
contemplate
the
slave
as
a
moral
and
intellectual
being
that
we
can
adequately
comprehend
the
unparalleled
enormity
of
slavery
and
the
intense
criminality
of
the
slaveholder
i
have
said
that
the
slave
was
a
man
what
a
piece
of
work
is
man
how
noble
in
reason
how
infinite
in
faculties
in
form
and
moving
how
express
and
admirable
in
action
how
like
an
angel
in
apprehension
how
like
a
god
the
beauty
of
the
world
the
paragon
of
animals
the
slave
is
a
man
the
image
of
god
but
a
little
lower
than
the
angels
possessing
a
soul
eternal
and
indestructible
capable
of
endless
happiness
or
immeasurable
woe
a
creature
of
hopes
and
fears
of
affections
and
passions
of
joys
and
sorrows
and
he
is
endowed
with
those
mysterious
powers
by
which
man
soars
above
the
things
of
time
and
sense
and
grasps
with
undying
tenacity
the
elevating
and
sublimely
glorious
idea
of
a
god
it
is
a
being
that
is
smitten
and
blasted
the
first
work
of
slavery
is
to
mar
and
deface
those
characteristics
of
its
victims
which
distinguish
from
and
from
its
first
aim
is
to
destroy
all
sense
of
high
moral
and
religious
responsibility
it
reduces
man
to
a
mere
machine
it
cuts
him
off
from
his
maker
it
hides
from
him
the
laws
of
god
and
leaves
him
to
grope
his
way
from
time
to
eternity
in
the
dark
under
the
arbitrary
and
despotic
control
of
a
frail
depraved
and
sinful
as
the
of
india
is
compelled
to
extract
the
deadly
teeth
of
his
venomous
prey
before
he
is
able
to
handle
him
with
impunity
so
the
slaveholder
must
strike
down
the
conscience
of
the
slave
before
he
can
obtain
the
entire
mastery
over
his
victim
it
is
then
the
first
business
of
the
enslaver
of
men
to
blunt
deaden
and
destroy
the
central
principle
of
human
responsibility
conscience
is
to
the
individual
soul
and
to
society
what
the
law
of
gravitation
is
to
the
universe
it
holds
society
together
it
is
the
basis
of
all
trust
and
confidence
it
is
the
pillar
of
all
moral
rectitude
without
it
suspicion
would
take
the
place
of
trust
vice
would
be
more
than
a
match
for
virtue
men
would
prey
upon
each
other
like
the
wild
beasts
of
the
desert
and
earth
would
become
a
nor
is
slavery
more
adverse
to
the
conscience
than
it
is
to
the
mind
this
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
in
every
state
of
the
american
union
where
slavery
exists
except
the
state
of
kentucky
there
are
laws
absolutely
prohibitory
of
education
among
the
slaves
the
crime
of
teaching
a
slave
to
read
is
punishable
with
severe
fines
and
imprisonment
and
in
some
instances
with
nor
are
the
laws
respecting
this
matter
a
dead
letter
cases
may
occur
in
which
they
are
disregarded
and
a
few
instances
may
be
found
where
slaves
may
have
learned
to
read
but
such
are
isolated
cases
and
only
prove
the
rule
the
great
mass
of
slaveholders
look
upon
education
among
the
slaves
as
utterly
subversive
of
the
slave
system
i
well
remember
when
my
mistress
first
announced
to
my
master
that
she
had
dis
covered
that
i
could
read
his
face
colored
at
once
with
surprise
and
chagrin
he
said
that
i
was
ruined
and
my
value
as
a
slave
destroyed
that
a
slave
should
know
nothing
but
to
obey
his
master
that
to
give
a
negro
an
inch
would
lead
him
to
take
an
ell
that
having
learned
how
to
read
i
would
soon
want
to
know
how
to
write
and
that
i
would
be
running
i
think
my
audience
will
bear
witness
to
the
correctness
of
this
philosophy
and
to
the
literal
fulfillment
of
this
prophecy
it
is
perfectly
well
understood
at
the
south
that
to
educate
a
slave
is
to
make
him
discontened
sic
with
slavery
and
to
invest
him
with
a
power
which
shall
open
to
him
the
treasures
of
freedom
and
since
the
object
of
the
slaveholder
is
to
maintain
complete
authority
over
his
slave
his
constant
vigilance
is
exercised
to
prevent
everything
which
militates
against
or
endangers
the
stability
of
his
authority
education
being
among
the
menacing
influences
and
perhaps
the
most
dangerous
is
therefore
the
most
cautiously
guarded
against
it
is
true
that
we
do
not
often
hear
of
the
enforcement
of
the
law
punishing
as
a
crime
the
teaching
of
slaves
to
read
but
this
is
not
because
of
a
want
of
disposition
to
enforce
it
the
true
reason
or
explanation
of
the
matter
is
this
there
is
the
greatest
unanimity
of
opinion
among
the
white
population
in
the
south
in
favor
of
the
policy
of
keeping
the
slave
in
ignorance
there
is
perhaps
another
reason
why
the
law
against
education
is
so
seldom
violated
the
slave
is
too
poor
to
be
able
to
offer
a
temptation
sufficiently
strong
to
induce
a
white
man
to
violate
it
and
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
in
a
community
where
the
moral
and
religious
sentiment
is
in
favor
of
slavery
many
martyrs
will
be
found
sacrificing
their
liberty
and
lives
by
violating
those
prohibitory
enactments
as
a
general
rule
then
darkness
reigns
over
the
abodes
of
the
enslaved
and
how
great
is
that
darkness
we
are
sometimes
told
of
the
contentment
of
the
slaves
and
are
entertained
with
vivid
pictures
of
their
happiness
we
are
told
that
they
often
dance
and
sing
that
their
masters
frequently
give
them
wherewith
to
make
merry
in
fine
that
they
have
little
of
which
to
complain
i
admit
that
the
slave
does
sometimes
sing
dance
and
appear
to
be
merry
but
what
does
this
prove
it
only
proves
to
my
mind
that
though
slavery
is
armed
with
a
thousand
stings
it
is
not
able
entirely
to
kill
the
elastic
spirit
of
the
bondman
that
spirit
will
rise
and
walk
abroad
despite
of
whips
and
chains
and
extract
from
the
cup
of
nature
occasional
drops
of
joy
and
gladness
no
thanks
to
the
slaveholder
nor
to
slavery
that
the
vivacious
captive
may
sometimes
dance
in
his
chains
his
very
mirth
in
such
circumstances
stands
before
god
as
an
accusing
angel
against
his
enslaver
it
is
often
said
by
the
opponents
of
the
cause
that
the
condition
of
the
people
of
ireland
is
more
deplorable
than
that
of
the
american
slaves
far
be
it
from
me
to
underrate
the
sufferings
of
the
irish
people
they
have
been
long
oppressed
and
the
same
heart
that
prompts
me
to
plead
the
cause
of
the
american
bondman
makes
it
impossible
for
me
not
to
sympathize
with
the
oppressed
of
all
lands
yet
i
must
say
that
there
is
no
analogy
between
the
two
cases
the
irishman
is
poor
but
he
is
not
a
slave
he
may
be
in
rags
but
he
is
not
a
slave
he
is
still
the
master
of
his
own
body
and
can
say
with
the
poet
the
hand
of
douglass
is
his
the
world
is
all
before
him
where
to
choose
and
poor
as
may
be
my
opinion
of
the
british
parliament
i
can
not
believe
that
it
will
ever
sink
to
such
a
depth
of
infamy
as
to
pass
a
law
for
the
recapture
of
fugitive
irishmen
the
shame
and
scandal
of
kidnapping
will
long
remain
wholly
monopolized
by
the
american
congress
the
irishman
has
not
only
the
liberty
to
emigrate
from
his
country
but
he
has
liberty
at
home
he
can
write
and
speak
and
cooperate
for
the
attainment
of
his
rights
and
the
redress
of
his
wrongs
the
multitude
can
assemble
upon
all
the
green
hills
and
fertile
plains
of
the
emerald
isle
they
can
pour
out
their
grievances
and
proclaim
their
wants
without
molestation
and
the
press
that
messenger
can
bear
the
tidings
of
their
doings
to
the
extreme
bounds
of
the
civilized
world
they
have
their
conciliation
hall
on
the
banks
of
the
liffey
their
reform
clubs
and
their
newspapers
they
pass
resolutions
send
forth
addresses
and
enjoy
the
right
of
petition
but
how
is
it
with
the
american
slave
where
may
he
assemble
where
is
his
conciliation
hall
where
are
his
newspapers
where
is
his
right
of
petition
where
is
his
freedom
of
speech
his
liberty
of
the
press
and
his
right
of
locomotion
he
is
said
to
be
happy
happy
men
can
speak
but
ask
the
slave
what
is
his
condition
what
his
state
of
mind
what
he
thinks
of
enslavement
and
you
had
as
well
address
your
inquiries
to
the
there
comes
no
from
the
enslaved
we
are
left
to
gather
his
feelings
by
imagining
what
ours
would
be
were
our
souls
in
his
soul
s
stead
if
there
were
no
other
fact
descriptive
of
slavery
than
that
the
slave
is
dumb
this
alone
would
be
sufficient
to
mark
the
slave
system
as
a
grand
aggregation
of
human
horrors
most
who
are
present
will
have
observed
that
leading
men
in
this
country
have
been
putting
forth
their
skill
to
secure
quiet
to
the
nation
a
system
of
measures
to
promote
this
object
was
adopted
a
few
months
ago
in
congress
the
result
of
those
measures
is
known
instead
of
quiet
they
have
produced
alarm
instead
of
peace
they
have
brought
us
war
and
so
it
must
ever
be
while
this
nation
is
guilty
of
the
enslavement
of
three
millions
of
innocent
men
and
women
it
is
as
idle
to
think
of
having
a
sound
and
lasting
peace
as
it
is
to
think
there
is
no
god
to
take
cognizance
of
the
affairs
of
men
there
can
be
no
peace
to
the
wicked
while
slavery
continues
in
the
land
it
will
be
condemned
and
while
it
is
condemned
there
will
be
agitation
nature
must
cease
to
be
nature
men
must
become
monsters
humanity
must
be
transformed
christianity
must
be
exterminated
all
ideas
of
justice
and
the
laws
of
eternal
goodness
must
be
utterly
blotted
out
from
the
human
soul
ere
a
system
so
foul
and
infernal
can
escape
condemnation
or
this
guilty
republic
can
have
a
sound
enduring
peace
inhumanity
of
slavery
extract
from
a
lecture
on
slavery
at
rochester
december
the
relation
of
master
and
slave
has
been
called
patriarchal
and
only
second
in
benignity
and
tenderness
to
that
of
the
parent
and
child
this
representation
is
doubtless
believed
by
many
northern
people
and
this
may
account
in
part
for
the
lack
of
interest
which
we
find
among
persons
whom
we
are
bound
to
believe
to
be
honest
and
humane
what
then
are
the
facts
here
i
will
not
quote
my
own
experience
in
slavery
for
this
you
might
call
testimony
i
will
not
cite
the
declarations
of
abolitionists
for
these
you
might
pronounce
exaggerations
i
will
not
rely
upon
advertisements
cut
from
newspapers
for
these
you
might
call
isolated
cases
but
i
will
refer
you
to
the
laws
adopted
by
the
legislatures
of
the
slave
states
i
give
you
such
evidence
because
it
can
not
be
invalidated
nor
denied
i
hold
in
my
hand
sundry
extracts
from
the
slave
codes
of
our
country
from
which
i
will
quote
now
if
the
foregoing
be
an
indication
of
kindness
is
if
this
be
parental
affection
is
bitter
a
more
atrocious
and
string
of
laws
could
not
well
be
conceived
of
and
yet
i
am
bound
to
say
that
they
fall
short
of
indicating
the
horrible
cruelties
constantly
practiced
in
the
slave
states
i
admit
that
there
are
individual
slaveholders
less
cruel
and
barbarous
than
is
allowed
by
law
but
these
form
the
exception
the
majority
of
slaveholders
find
it
necessary
to
insure
obedience
at
times
to
avail
themselves
of
the
utmost
extent
of
the
law
and
many
go
beyond
it
if
kindness
were
the
rule
we
should
not
see
advertisements
filling
the
columns
of
almost
every
southern
newspaper
offering
large
rewards
for
fugitive
slaves
and
describing
them
as
being
branded
with
irons
loaded
with
chains
and
scarred
by
the
whip
one
of
the
most
telling
testimonies
against
the
pretended
kindness
of
slaveholders
is
the
fact
that
uncounted
numbers
of
fugitives
are
now
inhabiting
the
dismal
swamp
preferring
the
untamed
wilderness
to
their
cultivated
homes
choosing
rather
to
encounter
hunger
and
thirst
and
to
roam
with
the
wild
beasts
of
the
forest
running
the
hazard
of
being
hunted
and
shot
down
than
to
submit
to
the
authority
of
masters
i
tell
you
my
friends
humanity
is
never
driven
to
such
an
unnatural
course
of
life
without
great
wrong
the
slave
finds
more
of
the
milk
of
human
kindness
in
the
bosom
of
the
savage
indian
than
in
the
heart
of
his
master
he
leaves
the
man
of
the
and
takes
refuge
with
the
man
of
the
he
rushes
from
the
praying
slaveholder
into
the
paws
of
the
bear
he
quits
the
homes
of
men
for
the
haunts
of
wolves
he
prefers
to
encounter
a
life
of
trial
however
bitter
or
death
however
terrible
to
dragging
out
his
existence
under
the
dominion
of
these
masters
the
apologists
for
slavery
often
speak
of
the
abuses
of
slavery
and
they
tell
us
that
they
are
as
much
opposed
to
those
abuses
as
we
are
and
that
they
would
go
as
far
to
correct
those
abuses
and
to
ameliorate
the
condition
of
the
slave
as
anybody
the
answer
to
that
view
is
that
slavery
is
itself
an
abuse
that
it
lives
by
abuse
and
dies
by
the
absence
of
abuse
grant
that
slavery
is
right
grant
that
the
relations
of
master
and
slave
may
innocently
exist
and
there
is
not
a
single
outrage
which
was
ever
committed
against
the
slave
but
what
finds
an
apology
in
the
very
necessity
of
the
case
as
we
said
by
a
slaveholder
the
rev
few
to
the
methodist
conference
if
the
relation
be
right
the
means
to
maintain
it
are
also
right
for
without
those
means
slavery
could
not
exist
remove
the
dreadful
scourge
the
plaited
thong
the
galling
fetter
the
accursed
chain
and
let
the
slaveholder
rely
solely
upon
moral
and
religious
power
by
which
to
secure
obedience
to
his
orders
and
how
long
do
you
suppose
a
slave
would
remain
on
his
plantation
the
case
only
needs
to
be
stated
it
carries
its
own
refutation
with
it
absolute
and
arbitrary
power
can
never
be
maintained
by
one
man
over
the
body
and
soul
of
another
man
without
brutal
chastisement
and
enormous
cruelty
to
talk
of
entering
into
a
relation
in
which
one
party
is
robbed
of
wife
of
children
of
his
hard
earnings
of
home
of
friends
of
society
of
knowledge
and
of
all
that
makes
this
life
desirable
is
most
absurd
wicked
and
preposterous
i
have
shown
that
slavery
is
wicked
wicked
in
that
it
violates
the
great
law
of
liberty
written
on
every
human
heart
wicked
in
that
it
violates
the
first
command
of
the
decalogue
wicked
in
that
it
fosters
the
most
disgusting
licentiousness
wicked
in
that
it
mars
and
defaces
the
image
of
god
by
cruel
and
barbarous
inflictions
wicked
in
that
it
contravenes
the
laws
of
eternal
justice
and
tramples
in
the
dust
all
the
humane
and
heavenly
precepts
of
the
new
testament
the
evils
resulting
from
this
huge
system
of
iniquity
are
not
confined
to
the
states
south
of
mason
and
dixon
s
line
its
noxious
influence
can
easily
be
traced
throughout
our
northern
borders
it
comes
even
as
far
north
as
the
state
of
new
york
traces
of
it
may
be
seen
even
in
rochester
and
travelers
have
told
me
it
casts
its
gloomy
shadows
across
the
lake
approaching
the
very
shores
of
queen
victoria
s
dominions
the
presence
of
slavery
may
be
explained
by
as
it
is
the
explanation
of
the
mobocratic
violence
which
lately
disgraced
new
york
and
which
still
more
recently
disgraced
the
city
of
boston
these
violent
demonstrations
these
outrageous
invasions
of
human
rights
faintly
indicate
the
presence
and
power
of
slavery
here
it
is
a
significant
fact
that
while
meetings
for
almost
any
purpose
under
heaven
may
be
held
unmolested
in
the
city
of
boston
that
in
the
same
city
a
meeting
can
not
be
peaceably
held
for
the
purpose
of
preaching
the
doctrine
of
the
american
declaration
of
independence
that
all
men
are
created
the
pestiferous
breath
of
slavery
taints
the
whole
moral
atmosphere
of
the
north
and
enervates
the
moral
energies
of
the
whole
people
the
moment
a
foreigner
ventures
upon
our
soil
and
utters
a
natural
repugnance
to
oppression
that
moment
he
is
made
to
feel
that
there
is
little
sympathy
in
this
land
for
him
if
he
were
greeted
with
smiles
before
he
meets
with
frowns
now
and
it
shall
go
well
with
him
if
he
be
not
subjected
to
that
peculiarly
fining
method
of
showing
fealty
to
slavery
the
assaults
of
a
mob
now
will
any
man
tell
me
that
such
a
state
of
things
is
natural
and
that
such
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
people
of
the
north
springs
from
a
consciousness
of
rectitude
no
every
fibre
of
the
human
heart
unites
in
detestation
of
tyranny
and
it
is
only
when
the
human
mind
has
become
familiarized
with
slavery
is
accustomed
to
its
injustice
and
corrupted
by
its
selfishness
that
it
fails
to
record
its
abhorrence
of
slavery
and
does
not
exult
in
the
triumphs
of
liberty
the
northern
people
have
been
long
connected
with
slavery
they
have
been
linked
to
a
decaying
corpse
which
has
destroyed
the
moral
health
the
union
of
the
government
the
union
of
the
north
and
south
in
the
political
parties
the
union
in
the
religious
organizations
of
the
land
have
all
served
to
deaden
the
moral
sense
of
the
northern
people
and
to
impregnate
them
with
sentiments
and
ideas
forever
in
conflict
with
what
as
a
nation
we
call
of
american
rightly
viewed
this
is
an
alarming
fact
and
ought
to
rally
all
that
is
pure
just
and
holy
in
one
determined
effort
to
crush
the
monster
of
corruption
and
to
scatter
its
guilty
profits
to
the
winds
in
a
high
moral
sense
as
well
as
in
a
national
sense
the
whole
american
people
are
responsible
for
slavery
and
must
share
in
its
guilt
and
shame
with
the
most
obdurate
of
the
south
while
slavery
exists
and
the
union
of
these
states
endures
every
american
citizen
must
bear
the
chagrin
of
hearing
his
country
branded
before
the
world
as
a
nation
of
liars
and
hypocrites
and
behold
his
cherished
flag
pointed
at
with
the
utmost
scorn
and
derision
even
now
an
american
is
pointed
out
in
the
crowd
as
coming
from
a
land
where
men
gain
their
fortunes
by
the
blood
of
souls
from
a
land
of
slave
markets
of
and
and
in
some
circles
such
a
man
is
shunned
altogether
as
a
moral
pest
is
it
not
time
then
for
every
american
to
awake
and
inquire
into
his
duty
with
respect
to
this
subject
wendell
phillips
the
eloquent
new
england
orator
on
his
return
from
europe
in
said
as
i
stood
upon
the
shores
of
genoa
and
saw
floating
on
the
placid
waters
of
the
mediterranean
the
beautiful
american
war
ship
ohio
with
her
masts
tapering
proportionately
aloft
and
an
eastern
sun
reflecting
her
noble
form
upon
the
sparkling
waters
attracting
the
gaze
of
the
multitude
my
first
impulse
was
of
pride
to
think
myself
an
american
but
when
i
thought
that
the
first
time
that
gallant
ship
would
gird
on
her
gorgeous
apparel
and
wake
from
beneath
her
sides
her
dormant
thunders
it
would
be
in
defense
of
the
african
slave
trade
i
blushed
in
utter
for
my
let
me
say
again
is
alike
the
sin
and
the
shame
of
the
american
people
it
is
a
blot
upon
the
american
name
and
the
only
national
reproach
which
need
make
an
american
hang
his
head
in
shame
in
the
presence
of
monarchical
governments
with
this
gigantic
evil
in
the
land
we
are
constantly
told
to
look
home
if
we
say
ought
against
crowned
heads
we
are
pointed
to
our
enslaved
millions
if
we
talk
of
sending
missionaries
and
bibles
abroad
we
are
pointed
to
three
millions
now
lying
in
worse
than
heathen
darkness
if
we
express
a
word
of
sympathy
for
kossuth
and
his
hungarian
fugitive
brethren
we
are
pointed
to
that
horrible
and
enactment
the
fugitive
slave
slavery
blunts
the
edge
of
all
our
rebukes
of
tyranny
abroad
the
criticisms
that
we
make
upon
other
nations
only
call
forth
ridicule
contempt
and
scorn
in
a
word
we
are
made
a
reproach
and
a
to
a
mocking
earth
and
we
must
continue
to
be
so
made
so
long
as
slavery
continues
to
pollute
our
soil
we
have
heard
much
of
late
of
the
virtue
of
patriotism
the
love
of
country
and
this
sentiment
so
natural
and
so
strong
has
been
impiously
appealed
to
by
all
the
powers
of
human
selfishness
to
cherish
the
viper
which
is
stinging
our
national
life
away
in
its
name
we
have
been
called
upon
to
deepen
our
infamy
before
the
world
to
rivet
the
fetter
more
firmly
on
the
limbs
of
the
enslaved
and
to
become
utterly
insensible
to
the
voice
of
human
woe
that
is
wafted
to
us
on
every
southern
gale
we
have
been
called
upon
in
its
name
to
desecrate
our
whole
land
by
the
footprints
of
and
even
to
engage
ourselves
in
the
horrible
business
of
kidnapping
i
too
would
invoke
the
spirit
of
patriotism
not
in
a
narrow
and
restricted
sense
but
i
trust
with
a
broad
and
manly
signification
not
to
cover
up
our
national
sins
but
to
inspire
us
with
sincere
repentance
not
to
hide
our
shame
from
the
the
sic
world
s
gaze
but
utterly
to
abolish
the
cause
of
that
shame
not
to
explain
away
our
gross
inconsistencies
as
a
nation
but
to
remove
the
hateful
jarring
and
incongruous
elements
from
the
land
not
to
sustain
an
egregious
wrong
but
to
unite
all
our
energies
in
the
grand
effort
to
remedy
that
wrong
i
would
invoke
the
spirit
of
patriotism
in
the
name
of
the
law
of
the
living
god
natural
and
revealed
and
in
the
full
belief
that
righteousness
exalteth
a
nation
while
sin
is
a
reproach
to
any
he
that
walketh
righteously
and
speaketh
uprightly
he
that
despiseth
the
gain
of
oppressions
that
shaketh
his
hands
from
the
holding
of
bribes
he
shall
dwell
on
high
his
place
of
defense
shall
be
the
munitions
of
rocks
bread
shall
be
given
him
his
water
shall
be
we
have
not
only
heard
much
lately
of
patriotism
and
of
its
aid
being
invoked
on
the
side
of
slavery
and
injustice
but
the
very
prosperity
of
this
people
has
been
called
in
to
deafen
them
to
the
voice
of
duty
and
to
lead
them
onward
in
the
pathway
of
sin
thus
has
the
blessing
of
god
been
converted
into
a
curse
in
the
spirit
of
genuine
patriotism
i
warn
the
american
people
by
all
that
is
just
and
honorable
to
beware
i
warn
them
that
strong
proud
and
prosperous
though
we
be
there
is
a
power
above
us
that
can
bring
down
high
looks
at
the
breath
of
whose
mouth
our
wealth
may
take
wings
and
before
whom
every
knee
shall
bow
and
who
can
tell
how
soon
the
avenging
angel
may
pass
over
our
land
and
the
sable
bondmen
now
in
chains
may
become
the
instruments
of
our
nation
s
chastisement
without
appealing
to
any
higher
feeling
i
would
warn
the
american
people
and
the
american
government
to
be
wise
in
their
day
and
generation
i
exhort
them
to
remember
the
history
of
other
nations
and
i
remind
them
that
america
can
not
always
sit
as
a
queen
in
peace
and
repose
that
prouder
and
stronger
governments
than
this
have
been
shattered
by
the
bolts
of
a
just
god
that
the
time
may
come
when
those
they
now
despise
and
hate
may
be
needed
when
those
whom
they
now
compel
by
oppression
to
be
enemies
may
be
wanted
as
friends
what
has
been
may
be
again
there
is
a
point
beyond
which
human
endurance
can
not
go
the
crushed
worm
may
yet
turn
under
the
heel
of
the
oppressor
i
warn
them
then
with
all
solemnity
and
in
the
name
of
retributive
justice
look
to
their
ways
for
in
an
evil
hour
those
sable
arms
that
have
for
the
last
two
centuries
been
engaged
in
cultivating
and
adorning
the
fair
fields
of
our
country
may
yet
become
the
instruments
of
terror
desolation
and
death
throughout
our
borders
it
was
the
sage
of
the
old
dominion
that
said
while
speaking
of
the
possibility
of
a
conflict
between
the
slaves
and
the
slaveholders
god
has
no
attribute
that
could
take
sides
with
the
oppressor
in
such
a
contest
i
tremble
for
my
country
when
i
reflect
that
god
and
that
his
justice
can
not
sleep
such
is
the
warning
voice
of
thomas
jefferson
and
every
day
s
experience
since
its
utterance
until
now
confirms
its
wisdom
and
commends
its
truth
what
to
the
slave
is
the
fourth
of
july
extract
from
an
oration
at
rochester
july
pardon
me
and
allow
me
to
ask
why
am
i
called
upon
to
speak
here
what
have
i
or
those
i
represent
to
do
with
your
national
independence
are
the
great
principles
of
political
freedom
and
of
natural
justice
embodied
in
that
declaration
of
independence
extended
to
us
and
am
i
therefore
called
upon
to
bring
our
humble
offering
to
the
national
altar
and
to
confess
the
benefits
and
express
devout
gratitude
for
the
blessings
resulting
from
your
independence
to
us
would
to
god
both
for
your
sakes
and
ours
that
an
affirmative
answer
could
be
truthfully
returned
to
these
questions
then
would
my
task
be
light
and
my
burden
easy
and
delightful
for
who
is
there
so
cold
that
a
nation
s
sympathy
could
not
warm
him
who
so
obdurate
and
dead
to
the
claims
of
gratitude
that
would
not
thankfully
acknowledge
such
priceless
benefits
who
so
stolid
and
selfish
that
would
not
give
his
voice
to
swell
the
hallelujahs
of
a
nation
s
jubilee
when
the
chains
of
servitude
had
been
torn
from
his
limbs
i
am
not
that
man
in
a
case
like
that
the
dumb
might
eloquently
speak
and
the
lame
man
leap
as
an
but
such
is
not
the
state
of
the
case
i
say
it
with
a
sad
sense
of
the
disparity
between
us
i
am
not
included
within
the
pale
of
this
glorious
anniversary
your
high
independence
only
reveals
the
immeasurable
distance
between
us
the
blessings
in
which
you
this
day
rejoice
are
not
enjoyed
in
common
the
rich
inheritance
of
justice
liberty
prosperity
and
independence
bequeathed
by
your
fathers
is
shared
by
you
not
by
me
the
sunlight
that
brought
life
and
healing
to
you
has
brought
stripes
and
death
to
me
this
fourth
of
july
is
not
mine
you
may
rejoice
i
must
mourn
to
drag
a
man
in
fetters
into
the
grand
illuminated
temple
of
liberty
and
call
upon
him
to
join
you
in
joyous
anthems
were
inhuman
mockery
and
sacrilegious
irony
do
you
mean
citizens
to
mock
me
by
asking
me
to
speak
if
so
there
is
a
parallel
to
your
conduct
and
let
me
warn
you
that
it
is
dangerous
to
copy
the
example
of
a
nation
whose
crimes
towering
up
to
heaven
were
thrown
down
by
the
breath
of
the
almighty
burying
that
nation
in
irrecoverable
ruin
i
can
take
up
the
plaintive
lament
of
a
peeled
and
people
by
the
rivers
of
babylon
there
we
sat
down
yea
we
wept
when
we
remembered
zion
we
hanged
our
harps
upon
the
willows
in
the
midst
thereof
for
there
they
that
carried
us
away
captive
required
of
us
a
song
and
they
who
wasted
us
required
of
us
mirth
saying
sing
us
one
of
the
songs
of
zion
how
can
we
sing
the
lord
s
song
in
a
strange
land
if
i
forget
thee
o
jerusalem
let
my
right
hand
forget
her
cunning
if
i
do
not
remember
thee
let
my
tongue
cleave
to
the
roof
of
my
above
your
national
tumultous
joy
i
hear
the
mournful
wail
of
millions
whose
chains
heavy
and
grievous
yesterday
are
rendered
more
intolerable
by
the
jubilant
shouts
that
reach
them
if
i
do
forget
if
i
do
not
faithfully
remember
those
bleeding
children
of
sorrow
this
day
may
my
right
hand
forget
her
cunning
and
may
my
tongue
cleave
to
the
roof
of
my
mouth
to
forget
them
to
pass
lightly
over
their
wrongs
and
to
chime
in
with
the
popular
theme
would
be
treason
most
scandalous
and
shocking
and
would
make
me
a
reproach
before
god
and
the
world
my
subject
then
is
american
slavery
i
shall
see
this
day
and
its
popular
characteristics
from
the
slave
s
point
of
view
standing
there
identified
with
the
american
bondman
making
his
wrongs
mine
i
do
not
hesitate
to
declare
with
all
my
soul
that
the
character
and
conduct
of
this
nation
never
looked
blacker
to
me
than
on
this
fourth
of
july
whether
we
turn
to
the
declarations
of
the
past
or
to
the
professions
of
the
present
the
conduct
of
the
nation
seems
equally
hideous
and
revolting
america
is
false
to
the
past
false
to
the
present
and
solemnly
binds
herself
to
be
false
to
the
future
standing
with
god
and
the
crushed
and
bleeding
slave
on
this
occasion
i
will
in
the
name
of
humanity
which
is
outraged
in
the
name
of
liberty
which
is
fettered
in
the
name
of
the
constitution
and
the
bible
which
are
disregarded
and
trampled
upon
dare
to
call
in
question
and
to
denounce
with
all
the
emphasis
i
can
command
everything
that
serves
to
perpetuate
slavery
the
great
sin
and
shame
of
america
i
will
not
equivocate
i
will
not
excuse
i
will
use
the
severest
language
i
can
command
and
yet
not
one
word
shall
escape
me
that
any
man
whose
judgment
is
not
blinded
by
prejudice
or
who
is
not
at
heart
a
slaveholder
shall
not
confess
to
be
right
and
just
but
i
fancy
i
hear
some
one
of
my
audience
say
it
is
just
in
this
circumstance
that
you
and
your
brother
abolitionists
fail
to
make
a
favorable
impression
on
the
public
mind
would
you
argue
more
and
denounce
less
would
you
persuade
more
and
rebuke
less
your
cause
would
be
much
more
likely
to
succeed
but
i
submit
where
all
is
plain
there
is
nothing
to
be
argued
what
point
in
the
creed
would
you
have
me
argue
on
what
branch
of
the
subject
do
the
people
of
this
country
need
light
must
i
undertake
to
prove
that
the
slave
is
a
man
that
point
is
conceded
already
nobody
doubts
it
the
slaveholders
themselves
acknowledge
it
in
the
enactment
of
laws
for
their
government
they
acknowledge
it
when
they
punish
disobedience
on
the
part
of
the
slave
there
are
crimes
in
the
state
of
virginia
which
if
committed
by
a
black
man
no
matter
how
ignorant
he
be
subject
him
to
the
punishment
of
death
while
only
two
of
these
same
crimes
will
subject
a
white
man
to
the
like
punishment
what
is
this
but
the
acknowledgement
that
the
slave
is
a
moral
intellectual
and
responsible
being
the
manhood
of
the
slave
is
conceded
it
is
admitted
in
the
fact
that
southern
statute
books
are
covered
with
enactments
forbidding
under
severe
fines
and
penalties
the
teaching
of
the
slave
to
read
or
write
when
you
can
point
to
any
such
laws
in
reference
to
the
beasts
of
the
field
then
i
may
consent
to
argue
the
manhood
of
the
slave
when
the
dogs
in
your
streets
when
the
fowls
of
the
air
when
the
cattle
on
your
hills
when
the
fish
of
the
sea
and
the
reptiles
that
crawl
shall
be
unable
to
distinguish
the
slave
from
a
brute
then
will
i
argue
with
you
that
the
slave
is
a
man
for
the
present
it
is
enough
to
affirm
the
equal
manhood
of
the
negro
race
is
it
not
astonishing
that
while
we
are
plowing
planting
and
reaping
using
all
kinds
of
mechanical
tools
erecting
houses
constructing
bridges
building
ships
working
in
metals
of
brass
iron
copper
silver
and
gold
that
while
we
are
reading
writing
and
cyphering
acting
as
clerks
merchants
and
secretaries
having
among
us
lawyers
doctors
ministers
poets
authors
editors
orators
and
teachers
that
while
we
are
engaged
in
all
manner
of
enterprises
common
to
other
men
digging
gold
in
california
capturing
the
whale
in
the
pacific
feeding
sheep
and
cattle
on
the
hillside
living
moving
acting
thinking
planning
living
in
families
as
husbands
wives
and
children
and
above
all
confessing
and
worshiping
the
christian
s
god
and
looking
hopefully
for
life
and
immortality
beyond
the
grave
we
are
called
upon
to
prove
that
we
are
men
would
you
have
me
argue
that
man
is
entitled
to
liberty
that
he
is
the
rightful
owner
of
his
own
body
you
have
already
declared
it
must
i
argue
the
wrongfulness
of
slavery
is
that
a
question
for
republicans
is
it
to
be
settled
by
the
rules
of
logic
and
argumentation
as
a
matter
beset
with
great
difficulty
involving
a
doubtful
application
of
the
principle
of
justice
hard
to
be
understood
how
should
i
look
in
the
presence
of
americans
dividing
and
subdividing
a
discourse
to
show
that
men
have
a
natural
right
to
freedom
speaking
of
it
relatively
and
positively
negatively
and
affirmatively
to
do
so
would
be
to
make
myself
ridiculous
and
to
offer
an
insult
to
your
understanding
there
is
not
a
man
beneath
the
canopy
of
heaven
that
does
not
know
that
slavery
is
wrong
for
what
am
i
to
argue
that
it
is
wrong
to
make
men
brutes
to
rob
them
of
their
liberty
to
work
them
without
wages
to
keep
them
ignorant
of
their
relations
to
their
to
beat
them
with
sticks
to
flay
their
flesh
with
the
lash
to
load
their
limbs
with
irons
to
hunt
them
with
dogs
to
sell
them
at
auction
to
sunder
their
families
to
knock
out
their
teeth
to
burn
their
flesh
to
starve
them
into
obedience
and
submission
to
their
masters
must
i
argue
that
a
system
thus
marked
with
blood
and
stained
with
pollution
is
wrong
no
i
will
not
i
have
better
employment
for
my
time
and
strength
than
such
arguments
would
imply
what
then
remains
to
be
argued
is
it
that
slavery
is
not
divine
that
god
did
not
establish
it
that
our
doctors
of
divinity
are
mistaken
there
is
blasphemy
in
the
thought
that
which
is
inhuman
can
not
be
divine
who
can
reason
on
such
a
proposition
they
that
can
may
i
can
not
the
time
for
such
argument
is
past
at
a
time
like
this
scorching
irony
not
convincing
argument
is
needed
oh
had
i
the
ability
and
could
i
reach
the
nation
s
ear
i
would
pour
out
a
fiery
stream
of
biting
ridicule
blasting
reproach
withering
sarcasm
and
stern
rebuke
for
it
is
not
light
that
is
needed
but
fire
it
is
not
the
gentle
shower
but
thunder
we
need
the
storm
the
whirlwind
and
the
earthquake
the
feeling
of
the
nation
must
be
quickened
the
conscience
of
the
nation
must
be
roused
the
propriety
of
the
nation
must
be
startled
the
hypocrisy
of
the
nation
must
be
exposed
and
its
crimes
against
god
and
man
must
be
proclaimed
and
denounced
what
to
the
american
slave
is
your
fourth
of
july
i
answer
a
day
that
reveals
to
him
more
than
all
other
days
in
the
year
the
gross
injustice
and
cruelty
to
which
he
is
the
constant
victim
to
him
your
celebration
is
a
sham
your
boasted
liberty
an
unholy
license
your
national
greatness
swelling
vanity
your
sounds
of
rejoicing
are
empty
and
heartless
your
denunciations
of
tyrants
impudence
your
shouts
of
liberty
and
equality
hollow
mockery
your
prayers
and
hymns
your
sermons
and
thanksgivings
with
all
your
religious
parade
and
solemnity
are
to
him
mere
bombast
fraud
deception
impiety
and
hypocrisy
a
thin
veil
to
cover
up
crimes
which
would
disgrace
a
nation
of
savages
there
is
not
a
nation
on
the
earth
guilty
of
practices
more
shocking
and
bloody
than
are
the
people
of
these
united
states
at
this
very
hour
go
where
you
may
search
where
you
will
roam
through
all
the
monarchies
and
despotisms
of
the
old
world
travel
through
south
america
search
out
every
abuse
and
when
you
have
found
the
last
lay
your
facts
by
the
side
of
the
practices
of
this
nation
and
you
will
say
with
me
that
for
revolting
barbarity
and
shameless
hypocrisy
america
reigns
without
a
rival
the
internal
slave
trade
extract
from
an
oration
at
rochester
july
take
the
american
slave
trade
which
we
are
told
by
the
papers
is
especially
prosperous
just
now
benton
tells
us
that
the
price
of
men
was
never
higher
than
now
he
mentions
the
fact
to
show
that
slavery
is
in
no
danger
this
trade
is
one
of
the
peculiarities
of
american
institutions
it
is
carried
on
in
all
the
large
towns
and
cities
in
of
this
confederacy
and
millions
are
pocketed
every
year
by
dealers
in
this
horrid
traffic
in
several
states
this
trade
is
a
chief
source
of
wealth
it
is
called
in
contradistinction
to
the
foreign
slave
trade
the
internal
slave
it
is
probably
called
so
too
in
order
to
divert
from
it
the
horror
with
which
the
foreign
slave
trade
is
contemplated
that
trade
has
long
since
been
denounced
by
this
government
as
piracy
it
has
been
denounced
with
burning
words
from
the
high
places
of
the
nation
as
an
execrable
traffic
to
arrest
it
to
put
an
end
to
it
this
nation
keeps
a
squadron
at
immense
cost
on
the
coast
of
africa
everywhere
in
this
country
it
is
safe
to
speak
of
this
foreign
slave
trade
as
a
most
inhuman
traffic
opposed
alike
to
the
laws
of
god
and
of
man
the
duty
to
extirpate
and
destroy
it
is
admitted
even
by
our
of
in
order
to
put
an
end
to
it
some
of
these
last
have
consented
that
their
colored
brethren
nominally
free
should
leave
this
country
and
establish
themselves
on
the
western
coast
of
africa
it
is
however
a
notable
fact
that
while
so
much
execration
is
poured
out
by
americans
upon
those
engaged
in
the
foreign
slave
trade
the
men
engaged
in
the
slave
trade
between
the
states
pass
without
condemnation
and
their
business
is
deemed
honorable
behold
the
practical
operation
of
this
internal
slave
trade
the
american
slave
trade
sustained
by
american
politics
and
american
religion
here
you
will
see
men
and
women
reared
like
swine
for
the
market
you
know
what
is
a
i
will
show
you
a
they
inhabit
all
our
southern
states
they
perambulate
the
country
and
crowd
the
highways
of
the
nation
with
droves
of
human
stock
you
will
see
one
of
these
armed
with
pistol
whip
and
driving
a
company
of
a
hundred
men
women
and
children
from
the
potomac
to
the
slave
market
at
new
orleans
these
wretched
people
are
to
be
sold
singly
or
in
lots
to
suit
purchasers
they
are
food
for
the
and
the
deadly
mark
the
sad
procession
as
it
moves
wearily
along
and
the
inhuman
wretch
who
drives
them
hear
his
savage
yells
and
his
oaths
as
he
hurries
on
his
affrighted
captives
there
see
the
old
man
with
locks
thinned
and
gray
cast
one
glance
if
you
please
upon
that
young
mother
whose
shoulders
are
bare
to
the
scorching
sun
her
briny
tears
falling
on
the
brow
of
the
babe
in
her
arms
see
too
that
girl
of
thirteen
weeping
yes
weeping
as
she
thinks
of
the
mother
from
whom
she
has
been
torn
the
drove
moves
tardily
heat
and
sorrow
have
nearly
consumed
their
strength
suddenly
you
hear
a
quick
snap
like
the
discharge
of
a
rifle
the
fetters
clank
and
the
chain
rattles
simultaneously
your
ears
are
saluted
with
a
scream
that
seems
to
have
torn
its
way
to
the
center
of
your
soul
the
crack
you
heard
was
the
sound
of
the
slave
whip
the
scream
you
heard
was
from
the
woman
you
saw
with
the
babe
her
speed
had
faltered
under
the
weight
of
her
child
and
her
chains
that
gash
on
her
shoulder
tells
her
to
move
on
follow
this
drove
to
new
orleans
attend
the
auction
see
men
examined
like
horses
see
the
forms
of
women
rudely
and
brutally
exposed
to
the
shocking
gaze
of
american
see
this
drove
sold
and
separated
forever
and
never
forget
the
deep
sad
sobs
that
arose
from
that
scattered
multitude
tell
me
citizens
where
under
the
sun
can
you
witness
a
spectacle
more
fiendish
and
shocking
yet
this
is
but
a
glance
at
the
american
slave
trade
as
it
exists
at
this
moment
in
the
ruling
part
of
the
united
states
i
was
born
amid
such
sights
and
scenes
to
me
the
american
slave
trade
is
a
terrible
reality
when
a
child
my
soul
was
often
pierced
with
a
sense
of
its
horrors
i
lived
on
philpot
street
fell
s
point
baltimore
and
have
watched
from
the
wharves
the
slave
ships
in
the
basin
anchored
from
the
shore
with
their
cargoes
of
human
flesh
waiting
for
favorable
winds
to
waft
them
down
the
chesapeake
there
was
at
that
time
a
grand
slave
mart
kept
at
the
head
of
pratt
street
by
austin
woldfolk
his
agents
were
sent
into
every
town
and
county
in
maryland
announcing
their
arrival
through
the
papers
and
on
flaming
headed
cash
for
these
men
were
generally
well
dressed
and
very
captivating
in
their
manners
ever
ready
to
drink
to
treat
and
to
gamble
the
fate
of
many
a
slave
has
depended
upon
the
turn
of
a
single
card
and
many
a
child
has
been
snatched
from
the
arms
of
its
mothers
by
bargains
arranged
in
a
state
of
brutal
drunkenness
the
gather
up
their
victims
by
dozens
and
drive
them
chained
to
the
general
depot
at
baltimore
when
a
sufficient
number
have
been
collected
here
a
ship
is
chartered
for
the
purpose
of
conveying
the
forlorn
crew
to
mobile
or
to
new
orleans
from
the
to
the
ship
they
are
usually
driven
in
the
darkness
of
night
for
since
the
agitation
a
certain
caution
is
observed
in
the
deep
still
darkness
of
midnight
i
have
been
often
aroused
by
the
dead
heavy
footsteps
and
the
piteous
cries
of
the
chained
gangs
that
passed
our
door
the
anguish
of
my
boyish
heart
was
intense
and
i
was
often
consoled
when
speaking
to
my
mistress
in
the
morning
to
hear
her
say
that
the
custom
was
very
wicked
that
she
hated
to
hear
the
rattle
of
the
chains
and
the
cries
i
was
glad
to
find
one
who
sympathized
with
me
in
my
horror
fellow
citizens
this
murderous
traffic
is
in
active
operation
in
this
boasted
republic
in
the
solitude
of
my
spirit
i
see
clouds
of
dust
raised
on
the
highways
of
the
south
i
see
the
bleeding
footsteps
i
hear
the
doleful
wail
of
fettered
humanity
on
the
way
to
the
slave
markets
where
the
victims
are
to
be
sold
like
horses
sheep
and
swine
knocked
off
to
the
highest
bidder
there
i
see
the
tenderest
ties
ruthlessly
broken
to
gratify
the
lust
caprice
and
rapacity
of
the
buyers
and
sellers
of
men
my
soul
sickens
at
the
sight
this
the
land
your
fathers
loved
the
freedom
which
they
toiled
to
win
is
this
the
earth
whereon
they
moved
are
these
the
graves
they
slumber
in
but
a
still
more
inhuman
disgraceful
and
scandalous
state
of
things
remains
to
be
presented
by
an
act
of
the
american
congress
not
yet
two
years
old
slavery
has
been
nationalized
in
its
most
horrible
and
revolting
form
by
that
act
mason
and
dixon
s
line
has
been
obliterated
new
york
has
become
as
virginia
and
the
power
to
hold
hunt
and
sell
men
women
and
children
as
slaves
remains
no
longer
a
mere
state
institution
but
is
now
an
institution
of
the
whole
united
states
the
power
is
coextensive
with
the
banner
and
american
christianity
where
these
go
may
also
go
the
merciless
where
these
are
man
is
not
sacred
he
is
a
bird
for
the
sportsman
s
gun
by
that
most
foul
and
fiendish
of
all
human
decrees
the
liberty
and
person
of
every
man
are
put
in
peril
your
broad
republican
domain
is
a
for
not
for
thieves
and
robbers
enemies
of
society
merely
but
for
men
guilty
of
no
crime
your
have
commanded
all
good
citizens
to
engage
in
this
hellish
sport
your
president
your
secretary
of
state
your
lords
nobles
and
ecclesiastics
enforce
as
a
duty
you
owe
to
your
free
and
glorious
country
and
to
your
god
that
you
do
this
accursed
thing
not
fewer
than
forty
americans
have
within
the
past
two
years
been
hunted
down
and
without
a
moment
s
warning
hurried
away
in
chains
and
consigned
to
slavery
and
excruciating
torture
some
of
these
have
had
wives
and
children
dependent
on
them
for
bread
but
of
this
no
account
was
made
the
right
of
the
hunter
to
his
prey
stands
superior
to
the
right
of
marriage
and
to
rights
in
this
republic
the
rights
of
god
included
for
black
men
there
are
neither
law
justice
humanity
nor
religion
the
fugitive
slave
law
makes
mercy
to
them
a
crime
and
bribes
the
judge
who
tries
them
an
american
judge
gets
ten
dollars
for
every
victim
he
consigns
to
slavery
and
five
when
he
fails
to
do
so
the
oath
of
an
sic
two
villains
is
sufficient
under
this
enactment
to
send
the
most
pious
and
exemplary
black
man
into
the
remorseless
jaws
of
slavery
his
own
testimony
is
nothing
he
can
bring
no
witnesses
for
himself
the
minister
of
american
justice
is
bound
by
the
law
to
hear
but
and
that
side
is
the
side
of
the
oppressor
let
this
damning
fact
be
perpetually
told
let
it
be
thundered
around
the
world
that
in
king
hating
democratic
christian
america
the
seats
of
justice
are
filled
with
judges
who
hold
their
office
under
an
open
and
palpable
and
are
bound
in
deciding
in
the
case
of
a
man
s
liberty
hear
only
his
accusers
in
glaring
violation
of
justice
in
shameless
disregard
of
the
forms
of
administering
law
in
cunning
arrangement
to
entrap
the
defenseless
and
in
diabolical
intent
this
fugitive
slave
law
stands
alone
in
the
annals
of
tyrannical
legislation
i
doubt
if
there
be
another
nation
on
the
globe
having
the
brass
and
the
baseness
to
put
such
a
law
on
the
if
any
man
in
this
assembly
thinks
differently
from
me
in
this
matter
and
feels
able
to
disprove
my
statements
i
will
gladly
confront
him
at
any
suitable
time
and
place
he
may
select
the
slavery
party
extract
from
a
speech
delivered
before
the
a
society
in
new
york
may
sir
it
is
evident
that
there
is
in
this
country
a
purely
slavery
party
a
party
which
exists
for
no
other
earthly
purpose
but
to
promote
the
interests
of
slavery
the
presence
of
this
party
is
felt
everywhere
in
the
republic
it
is
known
by
no
particular
name
and
has
assumed
no
definite
shape
but
its
branches
reach
far
and
wide
in
the
church
and
in
the
state
this
shapeless
and
nameless
party
is
not
intangible
in
other
and
more
important
respects
that
party
sir
has
determined
upon
a
fixed
definite
and
comprehensive
policy
toward
the
whole
colored
population
of
the
united
states
what
that
policy
is
it
becomes
us
as
abolitionists
and
especially
does
it
become
the
colored
people
themselves
to
consider
and
to
understand
fully
we
ought
to
know
who
our
enemies
are
where
they
are
and
what
are
their
objects
and
measures
well
sir
here
is
my
version
of
it
not
original
with
me
but
mine
because
i
hold
it
to
be
true
i
understand
this
policy
to
comprehend
five
cardinal
objects
they
are
these
the
complete
suppression
of
all
discussion
the
expatriation
of
the
entire
free
people
of
color
from
the
united
states
the
unending
perpetuation
of
slavery
in
this
republic
the
nationalization
of
slavery
to
the
extent
of
making
slavery
respected
in
every
state
of
the
union
the
extension
of
slavery
over
mexico
and
the
entire
south
american
states
sir
these
objects
are
forcibly
presented
to
us
in
the
stern
logic
of
passing
events
in
the
facts
which
are
and
have
been
passing
around
us
during
the
last
three
years
the
country
has
been
and
is
now
dividing
on
these
grand
issues
in
their
magnitude
these
issues
cast
all
others
into
the
shade
depriving
them
of
all
life
and
vitality
old
party
ties
are
broken
like
is
finding
its
like
on
either
side
of
these
great
issues
and
the
great
battle
is
at
hand
for
the
present
the
best
representative
of
the
slavery
party
in
politics
is
the
democratic
party
its
great
head
for
the
present
is
president
pierce
whose
boast
it
was
before
his
election
that
his
whole
life
had
been
consistent
with
the
interests
of
slavery
that
he
is
above
reproach
on
that
score
in
his
inaugural
address
he
reassures
the
south
on
this
point
well
the
head
of
the
slave
power
being
in
power
it
is
natural
that
the
pro
slavery
elements
should
cluster
around
the
administration
and
this
is
rapidly
being
done
a
fraternization
is
going
on
the
stringent
protectionists
and
the
strike
hands
the
supporters
of
fillmore
are
becoming
the
supporters
of
pierce
the
whig
shakes
hands
with
the
hunker
democrat
the
former
only
differing
from
the
latter
in
name
they
are
of
one
heart
one
mind
and
the
union
is
natural
and
perhaps
inevitable
both
hate
negroes
both
hate
progress
both
hate
the
higher
law
both
hate
william
seward
both
hate
the
free
democratic
party
and
upon
this
hateful
basis
they
are
forming
a
union
of
hatred
pilate
and
herod
are
thus
made
even
the
central
organ
of
the
whig
party
is
extending
its
beggar
hand
for
a
morsel
from
the
table
of
slavery
democracy
and
when
spurned
from
the
feast
by
the
more
deserving
it
pockets
the
insult
when
kicked
on
one
side
it
turns
the
other
and
preseveres
in
its
importunities
the
fact
is
that
paper
comprehends
the
demands
of
the
times
it
understands
the
age
and
its
issues
it
wisely
sees
that
slavery
and
freedom
are
the
great
antagonistic
forces
in
the
country
and
it
goes
to
its
own
side
silver
grays
and
hunkers
all
understand
this
they
are
therefore
rapidly
sinking
all
other
questions
to
nothing
compared
with
the
increasing
demands
of
slavery
they
are
collecting
arranging
and
consolidating
their
forces
for
the
accomplishment
of
their
appointed
work
the
keystone
to
the
arch
of
this
grand
union
of
the
slavery
party
of
the
united
states
is
the
compromise
of
in
that
compromise
we
have
all
the
objects
of
our
slaveholding
policy
specified
it
is
sir
favorable
to
this
view
of
the
designs
of
the
slave
power
that
both
the
whig
and
the
democratic
party
bent
lower
sunk
deeper
and
strained
harder
in
their
conventions
preparatory
to
the
late
presidential
election
to
meet
the
demands
of
the
slavery
party
than
at
any
previous
time
in
their
history
never
did
parties
come
before
the
northern
people
with
propositions
of
such
undisguised
contempt
for
the
moral
sentiment
and
the
religious
ideas
of
that
people
they
virtually
asked
them
to
unite
in
a
war
upon
free
speech
and
upon
conscience
and
to
drive
the
almighty
presence
from
the
councils
of
the
nation
resting
their
platforms
upon
the
fugitive
slave
bill
they
boldly
asked
the
people
for
political
power
to
execute
the
horrible
and
provisions
of
that
bill
the
history
of
that
election
reveals
with
great
clearness
the
extent
to
which
slavery
has
shot
its
leprous
distillment
through
the
of
the
nation
the
party
most
thoroughly
opposed
to
the
cause
of
justice
and
humanity
triumphed
while
the
party
suspected
of
a
leaning
toward
liberty
was
overwhelmingly
defeated
some
say
annihilated
but
here
is
a
still
more
important
fact
illustrating
the
designs
of
the
slave
power
it
is
a
fact
full
of
meaning
that
no
sooner
did
the
democratic
slavery
party
come
into
power
than
a
system
of
legislation
was
presented
to
the
legislatures
of
the
northern
states
designed
to
put
the
states
in
harmony
with
the
fugitive
slave
law
and
the
malignant
bearing
of
the
national
government
toward
the
colored
inhabitants
of
the
country
this
whole
movement
on
the
part
of
the
states
bears
the
evidence
of
having
one
origin
emanating
from
one
head
and
urged
forward
by
one
power
it
was
simultaneous
uniform
and
general
and
looked
to
one
end
it
was
intended
to
put
thorns
under
feet
already
bleeding
to
crush
a
people
already
bowed
down
to
enslave
a
people
already
but
half
free
in
a
word
it
was
intended
to
discourage
dishearten
and
drive
the
free
colored
people
out
of
the
country
in
looking
at
the
recent
black
law
of
illinois
one
is
struck
dumb
with
its
enormity
it
would
seem
that
the
men
who
enacted
that
law
had
not
only
banished
from
their
minds
all
sense
of
justice
but
all
sense
of
shame
it
coolly
proposes
to
sell
the
bodies
and
souls
of
the
blacks
to
increase
the
intelligence
and
refinement
of
the
whites
to
rob
every
black
stranger
who
ventures
among
them
to
increase
their
literary
fund
while
this
is
going
on
in
the
states
a
political
board
of
health
is
established
at
washington
senators
hale
chase
and
sumner
are
robbed
of
a
part
of
their
senatorial
dignity
and
consequence
as
representing
sovereign
states
because
they
have
refused
to
be
inoculated
with
the
slavery
virus
among
the
services
which
a
senator
is
expected
by
his
state
to
perform
are
many
that
can
only
be
done
efficiently
on
committees
and
in
saying
to
these
honorable
senators
you
shall
not
serve
on
the
committees
of
this
body
the
slavery
party
took
the
responsibility
of
robbing
and
insulting
the
states
that
sent
them
it
is
an
attempt
at
washington
to
decide
for
the
states
who
shall
be
sent
to
the
senate
sir
it
strikes
me
that
this
aggression
on
the
part
of
the
slave
power
did
not
meet
at
the
hands
of
the
proscribed
senators
the
rebuke
which
we
had
a
right
to
expect
would
be
administered
it
seems
to
me
that
an
opportunity
was
lost
that
the
great
principle
of
senatorial
equality
was
left
undefended
at
a
time
when
its
vindication
was
sternly
demanded
but
it
is
not
to
the
purpose
of
my
present
statement
to
criticise
the
conduct
of
our
friends
i
am
persuaded
that
much
ought
to
be
left
to
the
discretion
of
anti
slavery
men
in
congress
and
charges
of
recreancy
should
never
be
made
but
on
the
most
sufficient
grounds
for
of
all
the
places
in
the
world
where
an
man
needs
the
confidence
and
encouragement
of
friends
i
take
washington
to
be
that
place
let
me
now
call
attention
to
the
social
influences
which
are
operating
and
cooperating
with
the
slavery
party
of
the
country
designed
to
contribute
to
one
or
all
of
the
grand
objects
aimed
at
by
that
party
we
see
here
the
black
man
attacked
in
his
vital
interests
prejudice
and
hate
are
excited
against
him
enmity
is
stirred
up
between
him
and
other
laborers
the
irish
people
generous
and
sympathizing
with
the
oppressed
everywhere
when
they
stand
upon
their
own
green
island
are
instantly
taught
on
arriving
in
this
christian
country
to
hate
and
despise
the
colored
people
they
are
taught
to
believe
that
we
eat
the
bread
which
of
right
belongs
to
them
the
cruel
lie
is
told
the
irish
that
our
adversity
is
essential
to
their
prosperity
sir
the
will
find
out
his
mistake
one
day
he
will
find
that
in
assuming
our
avocation
he
also
has
assumed
our
degradation
but
for
the
present
we
are
sufferers
the
old
employments
by
which
we
have
heretofore
gained
our
livelihood
are
gradually
and
it
may
be
inevitably
passing
into
other
hands
every
hour
sees
us
elbowed
out
of
some
employment
to
make
room
perhaps
for
some
emigrants
whose
hunger
and
color
are
thought
to
give
them
a
title
to
especial
favor
white
men
are
becoming
cooks
and
stewards
common
laborers
and
flunkeys
to
our
gentry
and
for
aught
i
see
they
adjust
themselves
to
their
stations
with
all
becoming
obsequiousness
this
fact
proves
that
if
we
can
not
rise
to
the
whites
the
whites
can
fall
to
us
now
sir
look
once
more
while
the
colored
people
are
thus
elbowed
out
of
employment
while
the
enmity
of
emigrants
is
being
excited
against
us
while
state
after
state
enacts
laws
against
us
while
we
are
hunted
down
like
wild
game
and
oppressed
with
a
general
feeling
of
insecurity
the
american
colonization
society
that
old
offender
against
the
best
interests
and
slanderer
of
the
colored
people
awakens
to
new
life
and
vigorously
presses
its
scheme
upon
the
consideration
of
the
people
and
the
government
new
papers
are
started
some
for
the
north
and
some
for
the
south
and
each
in
its
tone
adapting
itself
to
its
latitude
government
state
and
national
is
called
upon
for
appropriations
to
enable
the
society
to
send
us
out
of
the
country
by
steam
they
want
steamers
to
carry
letters
and
negroes
to
africa
evidently
this
society
looks
upon
our
extremity
as
its
opportunity
and
we
may
expect
that
it
will
use
the
occasion
well
they
do
not
deplore
but
glory
in
our
misfortunes
but
sir
i
must
hasten
i
have
thus
briefly
given
my
view
of
one
aspect
of
the
present
condition
and
future
prospects
of
the
colored
people
of
the
united
states
and
what
i
have
said
is
far
from
encouraging
to
my
afflicted
people
i
have
seen
the
cloud
gather
upon
the
sable
brows
of
some
who
hear
me
i
confess
the
case
looks
black
enough
sir
i
am
not
a
hopeful
man
i
think
i
am
apt
even
to
undercalculate
the
benefits
of
the
future
yet
sir
in
this
seemingly
desperate
case
i
do
not
despair
for
my
people
there
is
a
bright
side
to
almost
every
picture
of
this
kind
and
ours
is
no
exception
to
the
general
rule
if
the
influences
against
us
are
strong
those
for
us
are
also
strong
to
the
inquiry
will
our
enemies
prevail
in
the
execution
of
their
designs
in
my
god
and
in
my
soul
i
believe
they
let
us
look
at
the
first
object
sought
for
by
the
slavery
party
of
the
country
viz
the
suppression
of
anti
slavery
discussion
they
desire
to
suppress
discussion
on
this
subject
with
a
view
to
the
peace
of
the
slaveholder
and
the
security
of
slavery
now
sir
neither
the
principle
nor
the
subordinate
objects
here
declared
can
be
at
all
gained
by
the
slave
power
and
for
this
reason
it
involves
the
proposition
to
padlock
the
lips
of
the
whites
in
order
to
secure
the
fetters
on
the
limbs
of
the
blacks
the
right
of
speech
precious
and
priceless
will
be
surrendered
to
slavery
its
suppression
is
asked
for
as
i
have
said
to
give
peace
and
security
to
slaveholders
sir
that
thing
can
not
be
done
god
has
interposed
an
insuperable
obstacle
to
any
such
result
there
can
be
saith
my
god
to
the
suppose
it
were
possible
to
put
down
this
discussion
what
would
it
avail
the
guilty
slaveholder
pillowed
as
he
is
upon
heaving
bosoms
of
ruined
souls
he
could
not
have
a
peaceful
spirit
if
every
tongue
in
the
nation
were
silent
every
organization
dissolved
every
press
demolished
every
anti
slavery
periodical
paper
book
pamphlet
or
what
not
were
searched
out
gathered
deliberately
burned
to
ashes
and
their
ashes
given
to
the
four
winds
of
heaven
still
still
the
slaveholder
could
have
no
in
every
pulsation
of
his
heart
in
every
throb
of
his
life
in
every
glance
of
his
eye
in
the
breeze
that
soothes
and
in
the
thunder
that
startles
would
be
waked
up
an
accuser
whose
cause
is
thou
art
verily
guilty
concerning
thy
the
movement
extracts
from
a
lecture
before
various
bodies
in
the
winter
of
a
grand
movement
on
the
part
of
mankind
in
any
direction
or
for
any
purpose
moral
or
political
is
an
interesting
fact
fit
and
proper
to
be
studied
it
is
such
not
only
for
those
who
eagerly
participate
in
it
but
also
for
those
who
stand
aloof
from
it
even
for
those
by
whom
it
is
opposed
i
take
the
movement
to
be
such
an
one
and
a
movement
as
sublime
and
glorious
in
its
character
as
it
is
holy
and
beneficent
in
the
ends
it
aims
to
accomplish
at
this
moment
i
deem
it
safe
to
say
it
is
properly
engrossing
more
minds
in
this
country
than
any
other
subject
now
before
the
american
people
the
late
john
calhoun
one
of
the
mightiest
men
that
ever
stood
up
in
the
american
senate
did
not
deem
it
beneath
him
and
he
probably
studied
it
as
deeply
though
not
as
honestly
as
gerrit
smith
or
william
lloyd
garrison
he
evinced
the
greatest
familiarity
with
the
subject
and
the
greatest
efforts
of
his
last
years
in
the
senate
had
direct
reference
to
this
movement
his
eagle
eye
watched
every
new
development
connected
with
it
and
he
was
ever
prompt
to
inform
the
south
of
every
important
step
in
its
progress
he
never
allowed
himself
to
make
light
of
it
but
always
spoke
of
it
and
treated
it
as
a
matter
of
grave
import
and
in
this
he
showed
himself
a
master
of
the
mental
moral
and
religious
constitution
of
human
society
daniel
webster
too
in
the
better
days
of
his
life
before
he
gave
his
assent
to
the
fugitive
slave
bill
and
trampled
upon
all
his
earlier
and
better
convictions
when
his
eye
was
yet
single
he
clearly
comprehended
the
nature
of
the
elements
involved
in
this
movement
and
in
his
own
majestic
eloquence
warned
the
south
and
the
country
to
have
a
care
how
they
attempted
to
put
it
down
he
is
an
illustration
that
it
is
easier
to
give
than
to
take
good
advice
to
these
two
men
the
greatest
men
to
whom
the
nation
has
yet
given
birth
may
be
traced
the
two
great
facts
of
the
present
the
south
triumphant
and
the
north
humbled
their
names
may
stand
thus
calhoun
and
domination
webster
and
degradation
yet
again
if
to
the
enemies
of
liberty
this
subject
is
one
of
engrossing
interest
vastly
more
so
should
it
be
such
to
freedom
s
friends
the
latter
it
leads
to
the
gates
of
all
valuable
knowledge
philanthropic
ethical
and
religious
for
it
brings
them
to
the
study
of
man
wonderfully
and
fearfully
made
the
proper
study
of
man
through
all
time
the
open
book
in
which
are
the
records
of
time
and
eternity
of
the
existence
and
power
of
the
movement
as
a
fact
you
need
no
evidence
the
nation
has
seen
its
face
and
felt
the
controlling
pressure
of
its
hand
you
have
seen
it
moving
in
all
directions
and
in
all
weathers
and
in
all
places
appearing
most
where
desired
least
and
pressing
hardest
where
most
resisted
no
place
is
exempt
the
quiet
prayer
meeting
and
the
stormy
halls
of
national
debate
share
its
presence
alike
it
is
a
common
intruder
and
of
course
has
the
name
of
being
ungentlemanly
brethren
who
had
long
sung
in
the
most
affectionate
fervor
and
with
the
greatest
sense
of
security
let
us
sweetly
live
together
let
us
die
have
been
suddenly
and
violently
separated
by
it
and
ranged
in
hostile
attitude
toward
each
other
the
methodist
one
of
the
most
powerful
religious
organizations
of
this
country
has
been
rent
asunder
and
its
strongest
bolts
of
denominational
brotherhood
started
at
a
single
surge
it
has
changed
the
tone
of
the
northern
pulpit
and
modified
that
of
the
press
a
celebrated
divine
who
four
years
ago
was
for
flinging
his
own
mother
or
brother
into
the
remorseless
jaws
of
the
monster
slavery
lest
he
should
swallow
up
the
union
now
recognizes
as
a
characteristic
of
future
civilization
signs
and
wonders
follow
this
movement
and
the
fact
just
stated
is
one
of
them
party
ties
are
loosened
by
it
and
men
are
compelled
to
take
sides
for
or
against
it
whether
they
will
or
not
come
from
where
he
may
or
come
for
what
he
may
he
is
compelled
to
show
his
hand
what
is
this
mighty
force
what
is
its
history
and
what
is
its
destiny
is
it
ancient
or
modern
transient
or
permanent
has
it
turned
aside
like
a
stranger
and
a
sojourner
to
tarry
for
a
night
or
has
it
come
to
rest
with
us
forever
excellent
chances
are
here
for
speculation
and
some
of
them
are
quite
profound
we
might
for
instance
proceed
to
inquire
not
only
into
the
philosophy
of
the
movement
but
into
the
philosophy
of
the
law
in
obedience
to
which
that
movement
started
into
existence
we
might
demand
to
know
what
is
that
law
or
power
which
at
different
times
disposes
the
minds
of
men
to
this
or
that
particular
object
now
for
peace
and
now
for
war
now
for
free
dom
and
now
for
slavery
but
this
profound
question
i
leave
to
the
abolitionists
of
the
superior
class
to
answer
the
speculations
which
must
precede
such
answer
would
afford
perhaps
about
the
same
satisfaction
as
the
learned
theories
which
have
rained
down
upon
the
world
from
time
to
time
as
to
the
origin
of
evil
i
shall
therefore
avoid
water
in
which
i
can
not
swim
and
deal
with
as
a
fact
like
any
other
fact
in
the
history
of
mankind
capable
of
being
described
and
understood
both
as
to
its
internal
forces
and
its
external
phases
and
relations
after
an
eloquent
a
full
and
highly
interesting
exposition
of
the
nature
character
and
history
of
the
movement
from
the
insertion
of
which
want
of
space
precludes
us
he
concluded
in
the
following
happy
manner
present
organizations
may
perish
but
the
cause
will
go
on
that
cause
has
a
life
distinct
and
independent
of
the
organizations
patched
up
from
time
to
time
to
carry
it
forward
looked
at
apart
from
the
bones
and
sinews
and
body
it
is
a
thing
immortal
it
is
the
very
essence
of
justice
liberty
and
love
the
moral
life
of
human
society
it
can
not
die
while
conscience
honor
and
humanity
remain
if
but
one
be
filled
with
it
the
cause
lives
its
incarnation
in
any
one
individual
man
leaves
the
whole
world
a
priesthood
occupying
the
highest
moral
eminence
even
that
of
disinterested
benevolence
whoso
has
ascended
his
height
and
has
the
grace
to
stand
there
has
the
world
at
his
feet
and
is
the
world
s
teacher
as
of
divine
right
he
may
set
in
judgment
on
the
age
upon
the
civilization
of
the
age
and
upon
the
religion
of
the
age
for
he
has
a
test
a
sure
and
certain
test
by
which
to
try
all
institutions
and
to
measure
all
men
i
say
he
may
do
this
but
this
is
not
the
chief
business
for
which
he
is
qualified
the
great
work
to
which
he
is
called
is
not
that
of
judgment
like
the
prince
of
peace
he
may
say
if
i
judge
i
judge
righteous
judgment
still
mainly
like
him
he
may
say
this
is
not
his
work
the
man
who
has
thoroughly
embraced
the
principles
of
justice
love
and
liberty
like
the
true
preacher
of
christianity
is
less
anxious
to
reproach
the
world
of
its
sins
than
to
win
it
to
repentance
his
great
work
on
earth
is
to
exemplify
and
to
illustrate
and
to
ingraft
those
principles
upon
the
living
and
practical
understandings
of
all
men
within
the
reach
of
his
influence
this
is
his
work
long
or
short
his
years
many
or
few
his
adherents
powerful
or
weak
his
instrumentalities
through
good
report
or
through
bad
report
this
is
his
work
it
is
to
snatch
from
the
bosom
of
nature
the
latent
facts
of
each
individual
man
s
experience
and
with
steady
hand
to
hold
them
up
fresh
and
glowing
enforcing
with
all
his
power
their
acknowledgment
and
practical
adoption
if
there
be
but
such
man
in
the
land
no
matter
what
becomes
of
abolition
societies
and
parties
there
will
be
an
cause
and
an
movement
fortunately
for
that
cause
and
fortunately
for
him
by
whom
it
is
espoused
it
requires
no
extraordinary
amount
of
talent
to
preach
it
or
to
receive
it
when
preached
the
grand
secret
of
its
power
is
that
each
of
its
principles
is
easily
rendered
appreciable
to
the
faculty
of
reason
in
man
and
that
the
most
unenlightened
conscience
has
no
difficulty
in
deciding
on
which
side
to
register
its
testimony
it
can
call
its
preachers
from
among
the
fishermen
and
raise
them
to
power
in
every
human
breast
it
has
an
advocate
which
can
be
silent
only
when
the
heart
is
dead
it
comes
home
to
every
man
s
understanding
and
appeals
directly
to
every
man
s
conscience
a
man
that
does
not
recognize
and
approve
for
himself
the
rights
and
privileges
contended
for
in
behalf
of
the
american
slave
has
not
yet
been
found
in
whatever
else
men
may
differ
they
are
alike
in
the
apprehension
of
their
natural
and
personal
rights
the
difference
between
abolitionists
and
those
by
whom
they
are
opposed
is
not
as
to
principles
all
are
agreed
in
respect
to
these
the
manner
of
applying
them
is
the
point
of
difference
the
slaveholder
himself
the
daily
robber
of
his
equal
brother
discourses
eloquently
as
to
the
excellency
of
justice
and
the
man
who
employs
a
brutal
driver
to
flay
the
flesh
of
his
negroes
is
not
offended
when
kindness
and
humanity
are
commended
every
time
the
abolitionist
speaks
of
justice
the
assents
says
yes
i
wish
the
world
were
filled
with
a
disposition
to
render
to
every
man
what
is
rightfully
due
him
i
should
then
get
what
is
due
me
that
s
right
let
us
have
justice
by
all
means
let
us
have
justice
every
time
the
abolitionist
speaks
in
honor
of
human
liberty
he
touches
a
chord
in
the
heart
of
the
which
responds
in
harmonious
vibrations
liberty
yes
that
is
evidently
my
right
and
let
him
beware
who
attempts
to
invade
or
abridge
that
right
every
time
he
speaks
of
love
of
human
brotherhood
and
the
reciprocal
duties
of
man
and
man
the
assents
says
yes
all
right
all
true
we
can
not
have
such
ideas
too
often
or
too
fully
expressed
so
he
says
and
so
he
feels
and
only
shows
thereby
that
he
is
a
man
as
well
as
an
you
have
only
to
keep
out
of
sight
the
manner
of
applying
your
principles
to
get
them
endorsed
every
time
contemplating
himself
he
sees
truth
with
absolute
clearness
and
distinctness
he
only
blunders
when
asked
to
lose
sight
of
himself
in
his
own
cause
he
can
beat
a
boston
lawyer
but
he
is
dumb
when
asked
to
plead
the
cause
of
others
he
knows
very
well
whatsoever
he
would
have
done
unto
himself
but
is
quite
in
doubt
as
to
having
the
same
thing
done
unto
others
it
is
just
here
that
lions
spring
up
in
the
path
of
duty
and
the
battle
once
fought
in
heaven
is
refought
on
the
earth
so
it
is
so
hath
it
ever
been
and
so
must
it
ever
be
when
the
claims
of
justice
and
mercy
make
their
demand
at
the
door
of
human
selfishness
nevertheless
there
is
that
within
which
ever
pleads
for
the
right
and
the
just
in
conclusion
i
have
taken
a
sober
view
of
the
present
movement
i
am
sober
but
not
hopeless
there
is
no
denying
for
it
is
everywhere
admitted
that
the
question
is
the
great
moral
and
social
question
now
before
the
american
people
a
state
of
things
has
gradually
been
developed
by
which
that
question
has
become
the
first
thing
in
order
it
must
be
met
herein
is
my
hope
the
great
idea
of
impartial
liberty
is
now
fairly
before
the
american
people
is
no
longer
a
thing
to
be
prevented
the
time
for
prevention
is
past
this
is
great
gain
when
the
movement
was
younger
and
weaker
when
it
wrought
in
a
boston
garret
to
human
apprehension
it
might
have
been
silently
put
out
of
the
way
things
are
different
now
it
has
grown
too
large
its
friends
are
too
numerous
its
facilities
too
abundant
its
ramifications
too
extended
its
power
too
omnipotent
to
be
snuffed
out
by
the
contingencies
of
infancy
a
thousand
strong
men
might
be
struck
down
and
its
ranks
still
be
invincible
one
flash
from
the
intellect
of
harriet
beecher
stowe
could
light
a
million
camp
fires
in
front
of
the
embattled
host
of
slavery
which
not
all
the
waters
of
the
mississippi
mingled
as
they
are
with
blood
could
extinguish
the
present
will
be
looked
to
by
after
coming
generations
as
the
age
of
literature
when
supply
on
the
gallop
could
not
keep
pace
with
the
ever
growing
demand
when
a
picture
of
a
negro
on
the
cover
was
a
help
to
the
sale
of
a
book
when
conservative
lyceums
and
other
american
literary
associations
began
first
to
select
their
orators
for
distinguished
occasions

drop
a
smiling
verse
of
sympathy
for
the
man
in

the
poets
are
with
us
it
would
seem
almost
absurd
to
say
it
considering
the
use
that
has
been
made
of
them
that
we
have
allies
in
the
ethiopian
songs
those
songs
that
constitute
our
national
music
and
without
which
we
have
no
national
music
they
are
heart
songs
and
the
finest
feelings
of
human
nature
are
expressed

them

as
well
as

smile
they
awaken
the
sympathies
for
the
slave
in
which
antislavery
principles
take
root
grow
and
flourish
in
addition
to
authors
poets
and
scholars
at
home
the
moral
sense
of
the
civilized
world
is
with
us
england
france
and
germany
the
three
great
lights
of
modern
civilization
are
with
us
and
every
american
traveler
learns
to
regret
the
existence
of
slavery
in
his
country
the
growth
of
intelligence
the
influence
of
commerce
steam
wind
and
lightning
are
our
allies
it
would
be
easy
to
amplify
this
summary
and
to
swell
the
vast
conglomeration
of
our
material
forces
but
there
is
a
deeper
and
truer
method
of
measuring
the
power
of
our
cause
and
of
comprehending
its
vitality
this
is
to
be
found
in
its
accordance
with
the
best
elements
of
human
nature
it
is
beyond
the
power
of
slavery
to
annihilate
affinities
recognized
and
established
by
the
almighty
the
slave
is
bound
to
mankind
by
the
powerful
and
inextricable
of
human
brotherhood
his
voice
is
the
voice
of
a
man
and
his
cry
is
the
cry
of
a
man
in
distress
and
man
must
cease
to
be
man
before
he
can
become
insensible
to
that
cry
it
is
the
righteous
of
the
cause
the
humanity
of
the
cause
which
constitutes
its
potency
as
one
genuine
bankbill
is
worth
more
than
a
thousand
counterfeits
so
is
one
man
with
right
on
his
side
worth
more
than
a
thousand
in
the
wrong
one
may
chase
a
thousand
and
put
ten
thousand
to
it
is
therefore
upon
the
goodness
of
our
cause
more
than
upon
all
other
auxiliaries
that
we
depend
for
its
final
triumph
another
source
of
congratulations
is
the
fact
that
amid
all
the
efforts
made
by
the
church
the
government
and
the
people
at
large
to
stay
the
onward
progress
of
this
movement
its
course
has
been
onward
steady
straight
unshaken
and
unchecked
from
the
beginning
slavery
has
gained
victories
large
and
numerous
but
never
as
against
this
movement
against
a
temporizing
policy
and
against
northern
timidity
the
slave
power
has
been
victorious
but
against
the
spread
and
prevalence
in
the
country
of
a
spirit
of
resistance
to
its
aggression
and
of
sentiments
favorable
to
its
entire
overthrow
it
has
yet
accomplished
nothing
every
measure
yet
devised
and
executed
having
for
its
object
the
suppression
of
has
been
as
idle
and
fruitless
as
pouring
oil
to
extinguish
fire
a
general
rejoicing
took
place
on
the
passage
of
the
compromise
measures
of
those
measures
were
called
peace
measures
and
were
afterward
termed
by
both
the
great
parties
of
the
country
as
well
as
by
leading
statesmen
a
final
settlement
of
the
whole
question
of
slavery
but
experience
has
laughed
to
scorn
the
wisdom
of
statesmen
and
their
final
settlement
of
agitation
seems
to
be
the
final
revival
on
a
broader
and
grander
scale
than
ever
before
of
the
question
which
they
vainly
attempted
to
suppress
forever
the
fugitive
slave
bill
has
especially
been
of
positive
service
to
the
movement
it
has
illustrated
before
all
the
people
the
horrible
character
of
slavery
toward
the
slave
in
hunting
him
down
in
a
free
state
and
tearing
him
away
from
wife
and
children
thus
setting
its
claims
higher
than
marriage
or
parental
claims
it
has
revealed
the
arrogant
and
overbearing
spirit
of
the
slave
states
toward
the
free
states
despising
their
principles
shocking
their
feelings
of
humanity
not
only
by
bringing
before
them
the
abominations
of
slavery
but
by
attempting
to
make
them
parties
to
the
crime
it
has
called
into
exercise
among
the
colored
people
the
hunted
ones
a
spirit
of
manly
resistance
well
calculated
to
surround
them
with
a
bulwark
of
sympathy
and
respect
hitherto
unknown
for
men
are
always
disposed
to
respect
and
defend
rights
when
the
victims
of
oppression
stand
up
manfully
for
themselves
there
is
another
element
of
power
added
to
the
movement
of
great
importance
it
is
the
conviction
becoming
every
day
more
general
and
universal
that
slavery
must
be
abolished
at
the
south
or
it
will
demoralize
and
destroy
liberty
at
the
north
it
is
the
nature
of
slavery
to
beget
a
state
of
things
all
around
it
favorable
to
its
own
continuance
this
fact
connected
with
the
system
of
bondage
is
beginning
to
be
more
fully
realized
the
is
not
satisfied
to
associate
with
men
in
the
church
or
in
the
state
unless
he
can
thereby
stain
them
with
the
blood
of
his
slaves
to
be
a
is
to
be
a
propagandist
from
necessity
for
slavery
can
only
live
by
keeping
down
the
morality
which
nature
supplies
every
white
babe
comes
armed
from
the
eternal
presence
to
make
war
on
slavery
the
heart
of
pity
which
would
melt
in
due
time
over
the
brutal
chastisements
it
sees
inflicted
on
the
helpless
must
be
hardened
and
this
work
goes
on
every
day
in
the
year
and
every
hour
in
the
day
what
is
done
at
home
is
being
done
also
abroad
here
in
the
north
and
even
now
the
question
may
be
asked
have
we
at
this
moment
a
single
free
state
in
the
union
the
alarm
at
this
point
will
become
more
general
the
slave
power
must
go
on
in
its
career
of
exactions
give
give
will
be
its
cry
till
the
timidity
which
concedes
shall
give
place
to
courage
which
shall
resist
such
is
the
voice
of
experience
such
has
been
the
past
such
is
the
present
and
such
will
be
that
future

the
subject
and
i
leave
off
where
i
began
consoling
myself
and
congratulating
the
friends
of
freedom
upon
the
fact
that
the
cause
is
not
a
new
thing
under
the
sun
not
some
moral
delusion
which
a
few
years
experience
may
dispel
it
has
appeared
among
men
in
all
ages
and
summoned
its
advocates
from
all
ranks
its
foundations
are
laid
in
the
deepest
and
holiest
convictions
and
from
whatever
soul
the
demon
selfishness
is
expelled
there
will
this
cause
take
up
its
abode
old
as
the
everlasting
hills
immovable
as
the
throne
of
god
and
certain
as
the
purposes
of
eternal
power
against
all
hinderances
and
against
all
delays
and
despite
all
the
mutations
of
human
instrumentalities
it
is
the
faith
of
my
soul
that
this
cause
will
triumph
