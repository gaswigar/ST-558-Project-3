introduction
the
author
has
endeavoured
in
this
story
to
paint
a
style
of
life
and
manners
which
existed
in
new
england
in
the
earlier
days
of
her
national
existence
some
of
the
principal
characters
are
historic
the
leading
events
of
the
story
are
founded
on
actual
facts
although
the
author
has
taken
the
liberty
to
arrange
and
vary
them
for
the
purposes
of
the
story
the
author
has
executed
the
work
with
a
reverential
tenderness
for
those
great
and
religious
minds
who
laid
in
new
england
the
foundations
of
many
generations
and
for
those
institutions
and
habits
of
life
from
which
as
from
a
fruitful
germ
sprang
all
the
present
prosperity
of
america
such
as
it
is
it
is
commended
to
the
kindly
thoughts
of
that
british
fireside
from
which
the
fathers
and
mothers
of
america
first
went
out
to
give
to
english
ideas
and
institutions
a
new
growth

a
new

katy
scudder
had
invited
brown
and
jones
and
deacon
twitchel
s
wife
to
take
tea
with
her
on
the
afternoon
of
june
second
when
one
has
a
story
to
tell
one
is
always
puzzled
which
end
of
it
to
begin
at
you
have
a
whole
corps
of
people
to
introduce
that
know
and
your
reader
doesn
t
and
one
thing
so
presupposes
another
that
whichever
way
you
turn
your
patchwork
the
figures
still
seem
the
small
item
that
i
have
given
will
do
as
well
as
any
other
to
begin
with
as
it
certainly
will
lead
you
to
ask
pray
who
was
katy
scudder
this
will
start
me
systematically
on
my
story
you
must
understand
that
in
the
then
small
of
newport
at
that
time
unconscious
of
its
present
fashion
and
fame
there
lived
nobody
in
those
days
who
did
not
know
the
widow
in
new
england
settlements
a
custom
has
obtained
which
is
wholesome
and
touching
of
ennobling
the
woman
whom
god
has
made
desolate
by
a
sort
of
brevet
rank
which
continually
speaks
for
her
as
a
claim
on
the
respect
and
consideration
of
the
community
the
widow
jones
or
brown
or
smith
is
one
of
the
fixed
institutions
of
every
new
england
village
doubtless
the
designation
acts
as
a
continual
plea
for
one
whom
bereavement
like
the
lightning
of
heaven
has
made
sacred
the
widow
scudder
however
was
one
of
the
sort
of
women
who
reign
queens
in
whatever
society
they
move
in
nobody
was
more
quoted
more
deferred
to
or
enjoyed
more
unquestioned
position
than
she
she
was
not
rich
small
farm
with
a
modest
cottage
was
her
sole
domain
but
she
was
one
of
the
class
who
in
the
speech
of
new
england
are
said
to
have
faculty
gift
which
among
that
shrewd
people
commands
more
esteem
than
beauty
riches
learning
or
any
other
worldly
endowment
is
yankee
for
and
the
opposite
virtue
to
shiftlessness
faculty
is
the
greatest
virtue
and
shiftlessness
the
greatest
vice
of
yankee
man
and
woman
to
her
who
has
faculty
nothing
shall
be
impossible
she
shall
scrub
floors
wash
wring
bake
brew
and
yet
her
hands
shall
be
small
and
white
she
shall
have
no
perceptible
income
yet
always
be
handsomely
dressed
she
shall
not
have
a
servant
in
her
house
a
dairy
to
manage
hired
men
to
feed
a
boarder
or
two
to
care
for
pickling
and
preserving
to
do
yet
you
commonly
see
her
every
afternoon
sitting
at
her
shady
behind
the
lilacs
cool
and
easy
hemming
muslin
or
reading
the
last
new
book
she
who
hath
faculty
is
never
in
a
hurry
never
behindhand
she
can
always
step
over
to
distressed
smith
whose
jelly
won
t
come
stop
to
show
jones
how
she
makes
her
pickles
so
green
be
ready
to
watch
with
poor
old
simpkins
who
is
down
with
the
rheumatism
of
this
genus
was
the
widow
scudder
as
the
neighbours
would
have
said
of
her
she
that
katy
stephens
katy
was
the
only
daughter
of
a
shipmaster
sailing
from
newport
harbour
who
was
wrecked
off
the
coast
one
cold
december
night
and
left
small
fortune
to
his
widow
and
only
child
katy
grew
up
however
a
tall
straight
girl
with
eyebrows
drawn
true
as
a
bow
a
foot
arched
like
a
spanish
woman
s
and
a
little
hand
which
never
saw
the
thing
it
could
not
do
of
speech
ready
of
wit
and
as
such
girls
have
a
right
to
be
somewhat
positive
withal
katy
could
harness
a
chaise
or
row
a
boat
she
could
saddle
and
ride
any
horse
in
the
neighbourhood
she
could
cut
any
garment
that
ever
was
seen
or
thought
of
make
cake
jelly
and
wine
from
her
earliest
years
in
most
precocious
style
all
without
seeming
to
derange
a
sort
of
trim
air
of
ladyhood
that
sat
jauntily
on
her
of
course
being
young
and
lively
she
had
her
admirers
and
some
in
worldly
affairs
laid
their
lands
and
houses
at
katy
s
feet
but
to
the
wonder
of
all
she
would
not
even
pick
them
up
to
look
at
them
people
shook
their
heads
and
wondered
whom
katy
stephens
expected
to
get
and
talked
about
going
through
the
wood
to
pick
up
a
crooked
stick
one
day
she
astonished
her
world
by
marrying
a
man
that
nobody
ever
thought
of
her
taking
george
scudder
was
a
grave
thoughtful
young
man
given
to
talking
and
silent
in
the
society
of
women
with
that
kind
of
reverential
bashfulness
which
sometimes
shows
a
pure
unworldly
nature
how
katy
came
to
fancy
him
everybody
wondered
he
never
talked
to
her
never
so
much
as
picked
up
her
glove
when
it
fell
never
asked
her
to
ride
or
sail
in
short
everybody
said
she
must
have
wanted
him
from
sheer
wilfulness
because
he
of
all
the
young
men
of
the
neighbourhood
never
courted
her
but
katy
having
very
sharp
eyes
saw
some
things
that
nobody
else
saw
for
example
you
must
know
she
discovered
by
mere
accident
that
george
scudder
always
was
looking
at
her
wherever
she
moved
though
he
looked
away
in
a
moment
if
discovered
that
an
accidental
touch
of
her
hand
or
brush
of
her
dress
would
send
the
blood
into
his
cheek
like
the
spirit
in
the
tube
of
a
thermometer
and
so
as
women
are
curious
you
know
katy
amused
herself
with
investigating
the
causes
of
these
little
phenomena
and
before
she
knew
it
got
her
foot
caught
in
a
cobweb
that
held
her
fast
and
constrained
her
whether
she
would
or
no
to
marry
a
poor
man
that
nobody
cared
much
for
but
herself
george
was
in
truth
one
of
the
sort
who
evidently
have
made
some
mistake
in
coming
into
this
world
at
all
as
their
internal
furniture
is
in
no
way
suited
to
its
general
courses
and
currents
he
was
of
the
order
of
dumb
poets
wretched
when
put
to
the
grind
of
the
hard
and
actual
for
if
he
who
would
utter
poetry
stretches
out
his
hand
to
a
gainsaying
world
he
is
worse
off
still
who
is
possessed
with
the
desire
of
living
it
especially
is
this
the
case
if
he
be
born
poor
and
with
a
dire
necessity
upon
him
of
making
immediate
efforts
in
the
hard
and
actual
george
had
a
helpless
invalid
mother
to
support
so
though
he
loved
reading
and
silent
thought
above
all
things
he
put
to
instant
use
the
only
convertible
worldly
talent
he
possessed
which
was
a
mechanical
genius
and
shipped
at
sixteen
as
a
he
studied
navigation
in
the
forecastle
and
found
in
its
calm
diagrams
and
tranquil
eternal
signs
food
for
his
thoughtful
nature
and
a
refuge
from
the
brutality
and
coarseness
of
sea
life
he
had
a
healthful
kindly
animal
nature
and
so
his
inwardness
did
not
ferment
and
turn
to
byronic
sourness
and
bitterness
nor
did
he
needlessly
parade
to
everybody
in
his
vicinity
the
great
gulf
which
lay
between
him
and
them
he
was
called
a
good
fellow
a
little
lumpish
as
he
was
brave
and
faithful
he
rose
in
time
to
be
a
shipmaster
but
when
came
the
business
of
making
money
the
aptitude
for
accumulating
george
found
himself
distanced
by
many
a
one
with
not
half
his
general
powers
what
shall
a
man
do
with
a
sublime
tier
of
moral
faculties
when
the
most
profitable
business
out
of
his
port
is
the
so
it
was
in
newport
in
those
days
george
s
first
voyage
was
on
a
slaver
and
he
wished
himself
dead
many
a
time
before
it
was
over
ever
after
would
talk
like
a
man
beside
himself
if
the
subject
was
named
he
declared
that
the
gold
made
in
it
was
distilled
from
human
blood
from
mothers
tears
from
the
agonies
and
dying
groans
of
gasping
suffocating
men
and
women
and
that
it
would
sear
and
blister
the
soul
of
him
that
touched
it
in
short
he
talked
as
unpractical
fellows
are
apt
to
talk
about
what
respectable
people
sometimes
do
nobody
had
ever
instructed
him
that
a
with
a
procession
of
expectant
sharks
in
its
wake
is
a
missionary
institution
by
which
heathens
are
brought
over
to
enjoy
the
light
of
the
gospel
so
though
george
was
acknowledged
to
be
a
good
fellow
and
honest
as
the
on
the
kitchen
floor
he
let
slip
so
many
chances
of
making
money
as
seriously
to
compromise
his
reputation
among
thriving
folks
he
was
wastefully
generous
on
treating
every
poor
dog
that
came
in
his
way
in
any
foreign
port
as
a
brother
refused
to
be
party
in
cheating
or
deceiving
the
heathen
on
any
shore
or
in
skin
of
any
colour
also
took
pains
as
far
as
in
him
lay
to
spoil
any
bargains
which
any
of
his
subordinates
founded
on
the
ignorance
or
weakness
of
his
so
he
made
voyage
after
voyage
and
gained
only
his
wages
and
the
reputation
among
his
employers
of
an
incorruptibly
honest
fellow
to
be
sure
it
was
said
that
he
carried
out
books
in
his
ship
and
read
and
studied
and
wrote
observations
on
all
the
countries
he
saw
which
parson
smith
told
miss
dolly
persimmon
would
really
do
credit
to
a
printed
book
but
then
they
never
printed
or
as
miss
dolly
remarked
of
them
they
never
seemed
to
come
to
coming
to
anything
as
she
understood
it
meant
standing
in
definite
relations
to
bread
and
butter
george
never
cared
however
for
money
he
made
enough
to
keep
his
mother
comfortable
and
that
was
enough
for
him
till
he
fell
in
love
with
katy
stephens
he
looked
at
her
through
those
glasses
which
such
men
carry
in
their
souls
and
she
was
a
mortal
woman
no
longer
but
a
transfigured
glorified
creature
object
of
awe
and
wonder
he
was
actually
afraid
of
her
her
glove
her
shoe
her
needle
thread
and
thimble
her
everything
in
short
she
wore
or
touched
became
invested
with
a
mysterious
charm
he
wondered
at
the
impudence
of
men
that
could
walk
up
and
talk
to
her
could
ask
her
to
dance
with
such
an
assured
air
he
wished
he
were
rich
he
dreamed
impossible
chances
of
his
coming
home
a
millionnaire
to
lay
unknown
wealth
at
katy
s
feet
and
when
miss
persimmon
the
ambulatory
dressmaker
of
the
neighbourhood
in
making
up
a
new
black
gown
for
his
mother
recounted
how
captain
blatherem
had
sent
katy
stephens
most
the
splendidest
india
shawl
that
ever
she
did
see
he
was
ready
to
tear
his
hair
at
the
thought
of
his
poverty
but
even
in
that
hour
of
temptation
he
did
not
repent
that
he
had
refused
all
part
and
lot
in
the
ship
by
which
captain
blatherem
s
money
was
made
for
he
knew
every
timber
of
it
to
be
seasoned
by
the
groans
and
saturated
with
the
sweat
of
human
agony
true
love
is
a
natural
sacrament
and
if
ever
a
young
man
thanks
god
for
having
saved
what
is
noble
and
manly
in
his
soul
it
is
when
he
thinks
of
offering
it
to
the
woman
he
loves
nevertheless
the
story
cost
him
a
night
s
rest
nor
was
it
till
miss
persimmon
had
ascertained
by
a
private
confabulation
with
katy
s
mother
that
she
had
indignantly
rejected
it
and
that
she
treated
the
captain
real
ridiculous
that
he
began
to
take
heart
he
ought
not
he
said
to
stand
in
her
way
now
when
he
had
nothing
to
offer
no
he
would
leave
katy
free
to
do
better
if
she
could
he
would
try
his
luck
and
if
when
he
came
home
from
the
next
voyage
katy
was
disengaged
why
then
he
would
lay
all
at
her
and
so
george
was
going
to
sea
with
a
secret
shrine
in
his
soul
at
which
he
was
to
burn
unsuspected
incense
but
after
all
the
mortal
maiden
whom
he
adored
suspected
this
private
arrangement
and
women
get
her
own
key
into
the
lock
of
his
secret
temple
because
as
girls
say
she
was
to
know
what
was
so
one
night
she
met
him
quite
accidentally
on
the
struck
up
a
little
conversation
and
begged
him
in
such
a
pretty
way
to
bring
her
a
spotted
shell
from
the
south
sea
like
the
one
on
his
mother
s
mantelpiece
and
looked
so
simple
and
childlike
in
saying
it
that
our
young
man
very
imprudently
committed
himself
by
remarking
that
when
people
had
rich
friends
to
bring
them
all
the
world
from
foreign
parts
he
never
dreamed
of
her
wanting
so
trivial
a
of
course
katy
didn
t
know
what
he
meant
hadn
t
heard
of
any
rich
and
then
came
something
about
captain
blatherem
and
katy
tossed
her
head
and
said
if
anybody
wanted
to
insult
her
they
might
talk
to
her
about
captain
blatherem
then
followed
this
that
and
the
other
till
finally
as
you
might
expect
out
came
all
that
never
was
to
have
been
said
and
katy
was
almost
frightened
at
the
terrible
earnestness
of
the
spirit
she
had
evoked
she
tried
to
laugh
and
ended
by
crying
and
saying
she
hardly
knew
what
but
when
she
came
to
herself
in
her
own
room
at
home
she
found
on
her
finger
a
ring
of
african
gold
that
george
had
put
there
which
she
did
not
send
back
like
captain
blatherem
s
presents
katy
was
like
many
intensely
and
practical
women
who
have
not
in
themselves
a
bit
of
poetry
or
a
particle
of
ideality
but
who
yet
worship
these
qualities
in
others
with
the
homage
which
the
indians
paid
to
the
unknown
tongue
of
the
first
whites
they
are
secretly
weary
of
a
certain
conscious
dryness
of
nature
in
themselves
and
this
weariness
predisposes
them
to
idolize
the
man
who
brings
them
this
unknown
gift
naturalists
say
that
every
defect
of
organization
has
its
compensation
and
men
of
ideal
natures
find
in
the
favour
of
women
the
equivalent
for
their
disabilities
among
men
do
you
remember
at
niagara
a
little
cataract
on
the
american
side
which
throws
its
silver
sheeny
veil
over
a
cave
called
the
grot
of
rainbows
whoever
stands
on
a
rock
in
that
grotto
sees
himself
in
the
centre
of
a
above
below
around
in
like
manner
merry
chatty
positive
busy
housewifely
katy
saw
herself
standing
in
a
in
her
lover
s
inner
soul
and
liked
to
see
herself
so
a
woman
must
be
very
insensible
who
is
not
moved
to
come
upon
a
higher
plane
of
being
herself
by
seeing
how
undoubtingly
she
is
insphered
in
the
heart
of
a
good
and
noble
man
a
good
man
s
faith
in
you
fair
lady
if
you
ever
have
it
will
make
you
better
and
nobler
even
before
you
know
it
katy
made
an
excellent
wife
she
took
home
her
husband
s
old
mother
and
nursed
her
with
a
dutifulness
and
energy
worthy
of
all
praise
and
made
her
own
keen
outward
faculties
and
deft
handiness
a
compensation
for
the
defects
in
worldly
estate
nothing
would
make
katy
s
bright
eyes
flash
quicker
than
any
reflections
on
her
husband
s
want
of
luck
in
the
material
line
she
didn
t
know
whose
business
it
was
if
was
satisfied
she
hated
these
sharp
gimlet
gouging
sort
of
men
that
would
put
a
screw
between
body
and
soul
for
money
george
had
that
in
him
that
nobody
understood
she
would
rather
be
his
wife
on
bread
and
water
than
to
take
captain
blatherem
s
house
carriages
and
horses
and
all
she
have
had
em
fast
enough
dear
knows
she
was
sick
of
making
money
when
she
saw
what
sort
of
men
could
make
it
so
on
all
which
talk
did
her
infinite
credit
because
she
care
and
was
naturally
as
proud
and
ambitious
a
little
minx
as
ever
breathed
and
was
thoroughly
grieved
at
heart
at
george
s
want
of
worldly
success
but
like
a
nice
little
robin
redbreast
she
covered
up
the
grave
of
her
worldliness
with
the
leaves
of
true
love
and
sang
a
who
cares
for
that
above
it
her
thrifty
management
of
the
money
her
husband
brought
her
soon
bought
a
snug
little
farm
and
put
up
the
little
brown
cottage
to
which
we
directed
your
attention
in
the
first
of
our
story
children
were
born
to
them
and
george
found
in
short
intervals
between
voyages
his
home
an
earthly
paradise
he
was
still
sailing
with
the
fond
illusion
in
every
voyage
of
making
enough
to
remain
at
home
the
yellow
fever
smote
him
under
the
line
and
the
ship
returned
to
newport
without
its
captain
george
was
a
christian
man
had
been
one
of
the
first
to
attach
himself
to
the
unpopular
and
unworldly
ministry
of
the
celebrated
and
to
appreciate
the
sublime
ideality
and
unselfishness
of
those
teachings
which
then
were
awakening
new
sensations
in
the
theological
mind
of
new
england
katy
too
had
become
a
professor
with
her
husband
in
the
same
church
and
his
death
in
the
midst
of
life
deepened
the
power
of
her
religious
impressions
she
became
absorbed
in
religion
after
the
fashion
of
new
england
where
devotion
is
doctrinal
not
ritual
as
she
grew
older
her
energy
of
character
her
vigour
and
good
judgment
caused
her
to
be
regarded
as
a
mother
in
israel
the
minister
boarded
at
her
house
and
it
was
she
who
was
first
to
be
consulted
in
all
matters
relating
to
the
of
the
church
no
woman
could
more
manfully
breast
a
long
sermon
or
bring
a
more
determined
faith
to
the
reception
of
a
difficult
doctrine
to
say
the
truth
there
lay
at
the
bottom
of
her
doctrinal
system
this
stable
mr
scudder
used
to
believe
it
and
after
all
that
is
said
about
independent
thought
isn
t
the
fact
that
a
just
and
good
soul
has
thus
or
thus
believed
a
more
respectable
argument
than
many
that
often
are
adduced
if
it
be
not
more
s
the
pity
of
the
faith
in
the
world
is
built
on
no
better
foundation
in
time
george
s
old
mother
was
gathered
to
her
son
and
two
sons
and
a
daughter
followed
their
father
to
the
only
remaining
of
the
flock
and
she
a
person
with
whom
you
and
i
good
reader
have
joint
concern
in
the
further
unfolding
of
our
story
chapter
ii
as
i
before
remarked
katy
scudder
had
invited
company
to
tea
strictly
speaking
it
is
necessary
to
begin
with
the
creation
of
the
world
in
order
to
give
a
full
account
of
anything
but
for
popular
use
something
less
may
serve
one
s
turn
and
therefore
i
shall
let
the
past
chapter
suffice
to
introduce
my
story
and
shall
proceed
to
arrange
my
scenery
and
act
my
little
play
on
the
supposition
that
you
know
enough
to
understand
things
and
persons
being
asked
to
tea
in
our
new
england
in
the
year
meant
something
very
different
from
the
same
invitation
in
our
more
sophisticated
days
in
those
times
people
held
to
the
singular
opinion
that
the
night
was
made
to
sleep
in
they
inferred
it
from
a
general
confidence
they
had
in
the
wisdom
of
mother
nature
supposing
that
she
did
not
put
out
her
lights
and
draw
her
and
hush
all
noise
in
her
great
without
strongly
intending
that
her
children
should
go
to
sleep
and
the
consequence
was
that
very
soon
after
sunset
the
whole
community
very
generally
set
their
faces
bedward
and
the
tolling
of
the
clock
had
an
awful
solemnity
in
it
sounding
to
the
full
good
society
in
new
england
in
those
days
very
generally
took
its
breakfast
at
six
its
dinner
at
twelve
and
its
tea
at
six
company
tea
however
among
thrifty
industrious
folk
was
often
taken
an
hour
earlier
because
each
of
the
inviteés
had
children
to
put
to
bed
or
other
domestic
cares
at
home
and
as
in
those
simple
times
people
were
invited
because
you
wanted
to
see
them
a
assembled
themselves
at
three
and
held
session
till
sundown
when
each
matron
rolled
up
her
and
wended
soberly
home
though
newport
even
in
those
early
times
was
not
without
its
families
which
affected
state
and
splendour
rolled
about
in
carriages
with
armorial
emblazonments
and
had
servants
in
abundance
to
every
turn
yet
there
as
elsewhere
in
new
england
the
majority
of
the
people
lived
with
the
wholesome
thrifty
simplicity
of
the
olden
time
when
labour
and
intelligence
went
hand
in
hand
in
perhaps
a
greater
harmony
than
the
world
has
ever
seen
our
scene
opens
in
the
great
kitchen
which
on
ordinary
occasions
is
the
family
dining
and
sitting
room
of
the
scudder
family
i
know
fastidious
moderns
think
that
the
wherein
are
carried
on
the
culinary
operations
of
a
large
family
must
necessarily
be
an
untidy
and
comfortless
but
it
is
only
because
they
are
ignorant
of
the
marvellous
workings
which
pertain
to
the
organ
of
faculty
on
which
we
have
before
insisted
the
kitchen
of
a
new
england
matron
was
her
her
pride
it
was
the
habit
of
her
life
to
produce
the
greatest
possible
results
there
with
the
slightest
possible
discomposure
and
what
any
woman
could
do
katy
scudder
could
do
everything
there
seemed
to
be
always
done
and
never
doing
washing
and
baking
those
formidable
disturbers
of
the
composure
of
families
were
all
over
within
those
two
or
three
when
we
are
composing
ourselves
for
a
last
nap
only
the
fluttering
of
linen
over
the
on
monday
mornings
proclaimed
that
the
dreaded
solemnity
of
a
wash
had
transpired
a
breakfast
arose
there
as
by
magic
and
in
an
incredibly
short
space
after
every
knife
fork
spoon
and
trencher
clean
and
shining
was
looking
as
innocent
and
unconscious
in
its
place
as
if
it
never
had
been
used
and
never
expected
to
be
the
floor
sir
you
remember
your
grandmother
s
floor
of
snowy
boards
sanded
with
whitest
sand
you
remember
the
ancient
fireplace
stretching
quite
across
one
end
vast
cavern
in
each
corner
of
which
a
cozy
seat
might
be
found
distant
enough
to
enjoy
the
crackle
of
the
great
jolly
across
the
room
ran
a
dresser
on
which
was
displayed
great
store
of
shining
pewter
dishes
and
plates
which
always
shone
with
the
same
mysterious
brightness
and
by
the
side
of
the
fire
a
commodious
wooden
settee
or
settle
offered
repose
to
people
too
little
accustomed
to
luxury
to
ask
for
a
cushion
oh
that
kitchen
of
the
olden
times
the
old
clean
roomy
new
england
kitchen
who
that
has
breakfasted
dined
and
supped
in
one
has
not
cheery
visions
of
its
thrift
its
warmth
its
coolness
the
on
its
floor
was
a
dial
that
told
of
some
of
the
happiest
days
thereby
did
we
right
up
the
shortcomings
of
the
solemn
old
clock
that
in
the
corner
and
whose
ticks
seemed
mysterious
prophecies
of
unknown
good
yet
to
arise
out
of
the
hours
of
life
how
dreamy
the
winter
twilight
came
in
there
yet
the
candles
were
not
lighted
the
crickets
chirped
around
the
dark
stone
hearth
and
shifting
tongues
of
flame
flickered
and
cast
dancing
shadows
and
elfish
lights
on
the
walls
while
grandmother
nodded
over
her
and
puss
purred
and
old
rover
lay
dreamily
opening
now
one
eye
and
then
the
other
on
the
family
group
with
all
our
ceiled
houses
let
us
not
forget
our
grandmothers
kitchens
but
we
must
pull
up
however
and
back
to
our
which
is
in
the
kitchen
of
katy
scudder
who
has
just
put
into
the
oven
by
the
fireplace
some
wondrous
for
whose
composition
she
is
renowned
she
has
examined
and
pronounced
perfect
a
loaf
of
cake
which
has
been
prepared
for
the
occasion
and
which
as
usual
is
done
exactly
right
the
best
room
too
has
been
opened
and
aired
white
saluted
with
a
friendly
little
shake
as
when
one
says
how
d
ye
do
to
a
friend
for
you
must
know
clean
as
our
kitchen
is
we
are
genteel
and
have
something
better
for
company
our
best
room
in
here
has
a
polished
little
mahogany
and
six
mahogany
chairs
with
claw
talons
grasping
balls
the
white
sanded
floor
is
crinkled
in
curious
little
waves
like
those
on
the
and
right
across
the
corner
stands
the
buffet
as
it
is
called
with
its
transparent
glass
doors
wherein
are
displayed
the
solemn
appurtenances
of
company
there
you
may
see
a
set
of
real
china
teacups
which
george
bought
in
canton
and
had
marked
with
his
and
his
wife
s
joint
initials
small
silver
which
has
come
down
as
an
heirloom
from
unknown
generations
spoons
and
delicate
china
which
have
been
all
carefully
reviewed
and
wiped
on
napkins
of
scudder
s
own
weaving
her
cares
now
over
she
stands
drying
her
hands
on
a
in
the
kitchen
while
her
only
daughter
the
gentle
mary
stands
in
the
doorway
with
the
afternoon
sun
streaming
in
spots
of
flickering
golden
light
on
her
smooth
hair
figure
in
a
full
stuff
petticoat
and
white
she
stands
reaching
up
one
hand
and
cooing
to
something
among
the
now
a
java
dove
comes
whirring
down
and
settles
on
her
finger
we
that
have
seen
pictures
think
as
we
look
on
her
girlish
face
with
its
lines
of
statuesque
beauty
the
tremulous
expression
of
her
lovely
mouth
and
the
general
air
of
simplicity
and
purity
some
old
pictures
of
the
girlhood
of
the
virgin
but
scudder
was
thinking
of
no
such
popish
matter
i
can
assure
you
she
i
don
t
think
you
could
have
done
her
a
greater
indignity
than
to
mention
her
daughter
in
any
such
connection
she
had
never
seen
a
painting
in
her
life
and
therefore
was
not
to
be
reminded
of
them
and
furthermore
the
dove
was
evidently
for
some
reason
no
favourite
she
said
in
a
quick
imperative
tone
come
come
child
don
t
fool
with
that
bird
it
s
high
time
we
were
dressed
and
ready
mary
blushing
as
it
would
seem
even
to
her
hair
gave
a
little
toss
and
sent
the
bird
like
a
silver
fluttering
cloud
up
among
the
rosy
and
now
she
and
her
mother
have
gone
to
their
respective
little
bedrooms
for
the
adjustment
of
their
toilets
and
while
the
door
is
shut
and
nobody
hears
us
we
shall
talk
to
you
about
mary
newport
at
the
present
day
blooms
like
a
with
young
ladies
of
the
best
girls
hopes
of
their
families
possessed
of
amiable
tempers
and
immensely
large
trunks
and
capable
of
sporting
ninety
changes
in
thirty
days
and
otherwise
rapidly
emptying
the
purses
of
distressed
fathers
and
whom
yet
travellers
and
the
world
in
general
look
upon
as
genuine
specimens
of
the
kind
of
girls
formed
by
american
institutions
we
fancy
such
a
one
lying
in
a
rustling
silk
and
amid
a
gentle
generality
of
rings
ribbons
puffs
laces
beaux
and
reading
our
humble
sketch
what
favour
shall
our
poor
heroine
find
in
her
eyes
for
though
her
mother
was
a
world
of
energy
and
faculty
in
herself
considered
and
had
bestowed
on
this
one
little
lone
chick
all
the
vigour
and
all
the
care
and
all
the
training
which
would
have
sufficed
for
a
family
of
sixteen
there
were
no
results
produced
which
could
be
made
appreciable
in
the
eyes
of
such
company
she
could
not
waltz
or
polk
or
speak
bad
french
or
sing
italian
songs
but
nevertheless
we
must
proceed
to
say
what
was
her
education
and
what
her
accomplishments
well
then
she
could
both
read
and
write
fluently
in
the
she
could
spin
both
on
the
little
and
the
great
wheel
and
there
were
numberless
towels
napkins
sheets
and
in
the
household
store
that
could
attest
the
skill
of
her
pretty
fingers
she
had
worked
several
samplers
of
such
rare
merit
that
they
hung
framed
in
different
rooms
of
the
house
exhibiting
every
variety
and
style
of
possible
letter
in
the
best
she
was
skilful
in
all
sewing
and
embroidery
in
all
shaping
and
cutting
with
a
quiet
and
deft
handiness
that
constantly
surprised
her
energetic
mother
who
could
not
conceive
that
so
much
could
be
done
with
so
little
noise
in
fact
in
all
household
lore
she
was
a
veritable
good
fairy
her
knowledge
seemed
unerring
and
intuitive
and
whether
she
washed
or
ironed
or
moulded
biscuit
or
conserved
plums
her
gentle
beauty
seemed
to
turn
to
poetry
all
the
prose
of
life
there
was
something
in
mary
however
which
divided
her
as
by
an
appreciable
line
from
ordinary
girls
of
her
age
from
her
father
she
had
inherited
a
deep
and
thoughtful
nature
predisposed
to
moral
and
religious
exaltation
had
she
been
born
in
italy
under
the
dissolving
influences
of
that
sunny
dreamy
clime
beneath
the
shadow
of
cathedrals
and
where
pictured
saints
and
angels
smiled
in
clouds
of
painting
from
every
arch
and
altar
she
might
like
fair
catherine
of
siena
have
seen
beatific
visions
in
the
sunset
skies
and
a
silver
dove
descending
upon
her
as
she
prayed
but
unfolding
in
the
clear
keen
cold
new
england
clime
and
nurtured
in
its
abstract
and
positive
theologies
her
religious
faculties
took
other
forms
instead
of
lying
entranced
in
mysterious
raptures
at
the
foot
of
altars
she
read
and
pondered
treatises
on
the
will
and
listened
in
rapt
attention
while
her
spiritual
guide
the
venerated
unfolded
to
her
the
theories
of
the
great
edwards
on
the
nature
of
true
virtue
womanlike
she
felt
the
subtle
poetry
of
these
sublime
abstractions
which
dealt
with
such
infinite
and
unknown
quantities
spoke
of
the
universe
of
its
great
architect
of
men
of
angels
as
matters
of
intimate
and
daily
contemplation
and
her
teacher
a
and
man
as
ever
lived
was
often
amazed
at
the
tread
with
which
this
fair
young
child
walked
through
these
high
regions
of
abstract
thought
comprehending
through
an
ethereal
clearness
of
nature
what
he
had
laboriously
and
heavily
reasoned
out
and
sometimes
when
she
turned
her
grave
childlike
face
upon
him
with
some
question
or
reply
the
good
man
started
as
if
an
angel
had
looked
suddenly
out
upon
him
from
a
cloud
unconsciously
to
himself
he
often
seemed
to
follow
her
as
dante
followed
the
flight
of
beatrice
through
the
ascending
circles
of
the
celestial
spheres
when
her
mother
questioned
him
anxiously
of
her
daughter
s
spiritual
estate
he
answered
that
she
was
a
child
of
a
strange
graciousness
of
nature
and
of
a
singular
genius
to
which
katy
responded
with
a
woman
s
pride
that
she
was
all
her
father
over
again
it
is
only
now
and
then
that
a
woman
is
sublimated
by
a
real
love
but
if
she
is
it
is
affecting
to
see
how
impossible
it
is
for
death
to
quench
it
for
in
the
child
the
mother
feels
that
she
has
a
mysterious
and
undying
repossession
of
the
father
but
in
truth
mary
was
only
a
recast
in
feminine
form
of
her
father
s
nature
the
elixir
of
the
spirit
that
sparkled
within
her
was
of
that
quality
of
which
the
souls
of
poets
and
artists
are
made
but
the
keen
new
england
air
crystallizes
emotions
into
ideas
and
restricts
many
a
poetic
soul
to
the
necessity
of
expressing
itself
only
in
practical
living
the
rigid
theological
discipline
of
new
england
is
fitted
to
produce
rather
strength
and
purity
than
enjoyment
it
was
not
fitted
to
make
a
sensitive
and
thoughtful
nature
happy
however
it
might
ennoble
and
exalt
the
system
of
was
one
that
could
only
have
had
its
origin
in
a
soul
at
once
reverential
and
logical
soul
moreover
trained
from
its
earliest
years
in
the
habits
of
thought
engendered
by
monarchical
institutions
for
although
he
like
other
ministers
took
an
active
part
as
a
patriot
in
the
revolution
still
he
was
brought
up
under
the
shadow
of
a
throne
and
a
man
can
not
ravel
out
the
stitches
in
which
early
days
have
knit
him
his
theology
was
in
fact
the
turning
to
an
invisible
sovereign
of
that
spirit
of
loyalty
and
unquestioning
subjugation
which
is
one
of
the
noblest
capabilities
of
our
nature
and
as
a
gallant
soldier
renounces
life
and
personal
aims
in
the
cause
of
his
king
and
country
and
holds
himself
ready
to
be
drafted
for
a
forlorn
hope
to
be
shot
down
or
help
make
a
bridge
of
his
mangled
body
over
which
the
more
fortunate
shall
pass
to
victory
and
glory
so
he
regarded
himself
as
devoted
to
the
king
eternal
ready
in
his
hands
to
be
used
to
illustrate
and
build
up
an
eternal
commonwealth
either
by
being
sacrificed
as
a
lost
spirit
or
glorified
as
a
redeemed
one
ready
to
throw
not
merely
his
mortal
life
but
his
immortality
even
into
the
forlorn
hope
to
bridge
with
a
soul
the
chasm
over
which
victors
should
pass
to
a
commonwealth
of
glory
and
splendour
whose
vastness
should
dwarf
the
misery
of
all
the
lost
to
an
infinitesimal
it
is
not
in
our
line
to
imply
the
truth
or
the
falsehood
of
those
systems
of
philosophic
theology
which
seem
for
many
years
to
have
been
the
principal
outlet
for
the
proclivities
of
the
new
england
mind
but
as
psychological
developments
they
have
an
intense
interest
he
who
does
not
see
a
grand
side
to
these
strivings
of
the
soul
can
not
understand
one
of
the
noblest
capabilities
of
humanity
no
real
artist
or
philosopher
ever
lived
who
has
not
at
some
hours
risen
to
the
height
of
utter
for
the
glory
of
the
invisible
there
have
been
painters
who
would
have
been
crucified
to
demonstrate
the
action
of
a
muscle
who
would
gladly
have
melted
themselves
and
all
humanity
in
their
crucible
if
so
a
new
discovery
might
arise
out
of
its
fumes
even
persons
of
mere
artistic
sensibility
are
at
times
raised
by
music
painting
or
poetry
to
a
momentary
trance
of
in
which
they
would
offer
their
whole
being
before
the
shrine
of
an
invisible
loveliness
these
hard
old
new
england
divines
were
the
poets
of
metaphysical
philosophy
who
built
systems
in
an
artistic
fervour
and
felt
self
exhale
from
beneath
them
as
they
rose
into
the
higher
regions
of
thought
but
where
theorists
and
philosophers
tread
with
sublime
assurance
woman
often
follows
with
bleeding
footsteps
are
always
turning
from
the
abstract
to
the
individual
and
feeling
where
the
philosopher
only
thinks
it
was
easy
enough
for
mary
to
believe
in
for
she
was
one
with
a
born
vocation
for
martyrdom
and
so
when
the
idea
was
put
to
her
of
suffering
eternal
pains
for
the
glory
of
god
and
the
good
of
being
in
general
she
responded
to
it
with
a
sort
of
sublime
thrill
such
as
it
is
given
to
some
natures
to
feel
in
view
of
uttermost
sacrifice
but
when
she
looked
around
on
the
warm
living
faces
of
friends
acquaintances
and
neighbours
viewing
them
as
possible
candidates
for
dooms
so
fearfully
different
she
sometimes
felt
the
walls
of
her
faith
closing
round
her
as
an
iron
shroud
wondered
that
the
sun
could
shine
so
brightly
that
flowers
could
flaunt
such
dazzling
colours
that
sweet
airs
could
breathe
and
little
children
play
and
youth
love
and
hope
and
a
thousand
intoxicating
influences
combine
to
cheat
the
victims
from
the
thought
that
their
next
step
might
be
into
an
abyss
of
horrors
without
end
the
blood
of
youth
and
hope
was
saddened
by
this
great
sorrow
which
lay
ever
on
her
heart
her
life
unknown
to
herself
was
a
sweet
tune
in
the
minor
key
it
was
only
in
prayer
or
deeds
of
love
and
charity
or
in
rapt
contemplation
of
that
beautiful
millennial
day
which
her
spiritual
guide
most
delighted
to
speak
of
that
the
tone
of
her
feelings
ever
rose
to
the
height
of
joy
among
mary
s
young
associates
was
one
who
had
been
as
a
brother
to
her
childhood
he
was
her
mother
s
cousin
s
son
so
by
a
sort
of
family
immunity
had
always
a
free
access
to
her
mother
s
house
he
took
to
the
sea
as
the
most
bold
and
resolute
young
men
will
and
brought
home
from
foreign
parts
those
new
modes
of
speech
those
other
eyes
for
received
opinions
and
established
things
which
so
often
shock
established
prejudices
that
he
was
held
as
little
better
than
an
infidel
and
a
castaway
by
the
stricter
religious
circles
in
his
native
place
mary
s
mother
now
that
mary
was
grown
up
to
woman
s
estate
looked
with
a
severe
eye
on
her
cousin
she
warned
her
daughter
against
too
free
an
association
with
him
we
all
know
what
comes
to
pass
when
girls
are
constantly
warned
not
to
think
of
a
man
the
most
conscientious
and
obedient
little
person
in
the
world
mary
resolved
to
be
very
careful
she
never
would
think
of
james
except
of
course
in
her
prayers
but
as
these
were
constant
it
may
easily
be
seen
it
was
not
easy
to
forget
him
all
that
was
so
often
told
her
of
his
carelessness
his
trifling
his
contempt
of
orthodox
opinions
and
his
startling
and
bold
expressions
only
wrote
his
name
deeper
in
her
heart
was
not
his
soul
in
peril
could
she
look
in
his
frank
joyous
face
and
listen
to
his
thoughtless
laugh
and
then
think
that
a
fall
from
a
or
one
night
s
storm
with
what
images
her
faith
filled
the
blank
could
she
believe
all
this
and
forget
him
you
see
instead
of
getting
our
tea
ready
as
we
promised
at
the
beginning
of
this
chapter
we
have
filled
it
with
descriptions
and
meditations
now
we
foresee
that
the
next
chapter
will
be
equally
far
from
the
point
but
have
patience
with
us
for
we
can
write
only
as
we
are
driven
and
never
know
exactly
where
we
are
going
to
land
chapter
iii
a
quiet
place
was
mary
s
little
room
the
window
looked
out
under
the
overarching
boughs
of
a
thick
apple
orchard
now
all
in
a
blush
with
blossoms
and
buds
and
the
light
came
strained
through
flickering
leaves
an
rustle
and
whirr
of
branches
and
blossoms
a
chitter
of
birds
and
an
indefinite
whispering
motion
as
the
long
heads
of
nodded
and
bowed
to
each
other
under
the
trees
seemed
to
give
the
room
the
quiet
hush
of
some
little
side
chapel
in
a
cathedral
where
green
and
golden
glass
softens
the
sunlight
and
only
the
sigh
and
rustle
of
kneeling
worshippers
break
the
stillness
of
the
aisles
it
was
small
enough
for
a
nun
s
apartment
and
dainty
in
its
neatness
as
the
waxen
cell
of
a
bee
the
bed
and
low
window
were
draped
in
spotless
white
with
fringes
of
mary
s
own
knotting
a
small
table
under
the
bore
the
library
of
a
young
woman
of
those
times
the
spectator
paradise
lost
shakspeare
and
robinson
crusoe
stood
for
the
admitted
secular
literature
and
beside
them
the
bible
and
the
works
then
published
of
jonathan
edwards
laid
a
little
to
one
side
as
if
of
doubtful
reputation
was
the
only
novel
which
the
stricter
people
in
those
days
allowed
for
the
reading
of
their
daughters
that
trailing
tedious
delightful
old
bore
sir
charles
grandison
book
whose
influence
in
those
times
was
so
universal
that
it
may
be
traced
in
the
epistolary
style
even
of
the
gravest
divines
our
little
heroine
was
mortal
with
all
her
divinity
and
had
an
imagination
which
sometimes
wandered
to
the
things
of
earth
and
this
glorious
hero
in
lace
and
embroidery
who
blended
rank
gallantry
spirit
knowledge
of
the
world
disinterestedness
constancy
and
piety
sometimes
walked
before
her
while
she
sat
spinning
at
her
wheel
till
she
sighed
she
hardly
knew
why
that
no
such
men
walked
the
earth
now
yet
it
is
to
be
confessed
this
occasional
raid
of
the
romantic
into
mary
s
balanced
and
mind
was
soon
energetically
put
to
rout
and
the
book
as
we
have
said
remained
on
her
table
under
protest
by
being
her
father
s
gift
to
her
mother
during
their
days
of
courtship
the
small
was
curiously
wreathed
with
corals
and
foreign
shells
so
disposed
as
to
indicate
an
artistic
eye
and
skilful
hand
and
some
curious
chinese
paintings
of
birds
and
flowers
gave
rather
a
piquant
and
foreign
air
to
the
otherwise
homely
neatness
of
the
apartment
here
in
this
little
retreat
mary
spent
those
few
hours
which
her
exacting
conscience
would
allow
her
to
spare
from
her
here
she
read
and
wrote
and
thought
and
prayed
here
she
stands
now
arraying
herself
for
the
tea
company
that
afternoon
dress
which
in
our
day
is
becoming
in
some
cases
the
whole
of
woman
was
in
those
times
a
remarkably
simple
affair
true
every
person
of
a
certain
degree
of
respectability
had
state
and
festival
robes
and
a
certain
trunk
which
was
always
kept
solemnly
locked
in
katy
scudder
s
apartment
if
it
could
have
spoken
might
have
given
off
quite
a
catalogue
of
brocade
satin
and
laces
the
there
slumbered
in
all
the
unsullied
whiteness
of
its
stiff
ground
broidered
with
heavy
knots
of
flowers
and
there
were
scarfs
of
wrought
india
muslin
and
embroidered
crape
each
of
which
had
its
history
each
had
been
brought
into
the
door
with
beating
heart
on
some
return
voyage
of
one
who
alas
should
return
no
more
the
old
trunk
stood
with
its
histories
its
imprisoned
remembrances
a
thousand
tender
thoughts
seemed
to
be
shaping
out
of
every
rustling
fold
of
silk
and
embroidery
on
the
few
yearly
occasions
when
all
were
brought
out
to
be
aired
their
history
related
and
then
solemnly
locked
up
again
nevertheless
the
possession
of
these
things
gave
to
the
women
of
an
establishment
a
certain
innate
dignity
like
a
good
conscience
so
that
in
that
larger
portion
of
existence
commonly
denominated
among
them
every
day
they
were
content
with
plain
stuff
and
homespun
mary
s
toilet
therefore
was
sooner
made
than
those
of
newport
belles
of
the
present
day
it
simply
consisted
in
changing
her
ordinary
and
petticoat
for
another
of
somewhat
nicer
materials
a
skirt
of
india
chintz
and
a
striped
jaconet
her
hair
was
of
the
kind
which
always
lies
like
satin
but
nevertheless
girls
never
think
their
toilet
complete
unless
the
smoothest
hair
has
been
shaken
down
and
rearranged
a
few
moments
however
served
to
braid
its
shining
folds
and
dispose
them
in
their
simple
knot
on
the
back
of
the
head
and
having
given
a
final
stroke
to
each
side
with
her
little
dimpled
hands
she
sat
down
a
moment
at
the
window
thoughtfully
watching
where
the
afternoon
sun
was
creeping
through
the
slates
of
the
fence
in
long
lines
of
gold
among
the
tall
tremulous
and
unconsciously
she
began
warbling
in
a
low
gurgling
voice
the
words
of
a
familiar
hymn
whose
grave
earnestness
accorded
well
with
the
general
tone
of
her
life
and
education
life
is
the
time
to
serve
the
lord
the
time
t
insure
the
great
there
was
a
swish
and
rustle
in
the
and
a
tramp
of
elastic
steps
then
the
branches
were
brushed
aside
and
a
young
man
suddenly
emerged
from
the
trees
a
little
behind
mary
he
was
apparently
about
dressed
in
the
holiday
rig
of
a
sailor
on
shore
which
well
set
off
his
fine
athletic
figure
and
accorded
with
a
sort
of
easy
dashing
and
confident
air
which
sat
not
unhandsomely
on
him
for
the
rest
a
high
forehead
shaded
by
rings
of
the
blackest
hair
a
keen
dark
eye
a
firm
and
determined
mouth
gave
the
impression
of
one
who
had
engaged
to
do
battle
with
life
not
only
with
a
will
but
with
shrewdness
and
ability
illustration
and
her
sampson
low
son
jany
he
introduced
the
colloquy
by
stepping
deliberately
behind
mary
putting
his
arms
round
her
neck
and
kissing
her
why
james
said
mary
starting
up
and
blushing
come
now
i
have
come
haven
t
i
said
the
young
man
leaning
his
elbow
on
the
and
looking
at
her
with
an
air
of
comic
determined
frankness
which
yet
had
in
it
such
wholesome
honesty
that
it
was
scarcely
possible
to
be
angry
the
fact
is
mary
he
added
with
a
sudden
earnest
darkening
of
the
face
i
won
t
stand
this
nonsense
any
longer
aunt
katy
has
been
holding
me
at
arm
s
length
ever
since
i
got
home
and
what
have
i
done
haven
t
i
been
to
every
and
lecture
and
sermon
since
i
got
into
port
just
as
regular
as
a
and
not
a
bit
of
a
word
could
i
get
with
you
and
no
chance
even
so
much
as
to
give
you
my
arm
aunt
katy
always
comes
between
us
and
says
here
mary
you
take
my
what
does
she
think
i
go
to
meeting
for
and
almost
break
my
jaws
keeping
down
the
gapes
i
never
even
go
to
sleep
and
yet
i
am
treated
in
this
way
it
s
too
bad
what
s
the
row
what
s
anybody
been
saying
about
me
i
always
have
waited
on
you
ever
since
you
were
that
high
didn
t
i
always
draw
you
to
school
on
my
sled
didn
t
we
always
use
to
do
our
sums
together
didn
t
i
always
wait
on
you
to
singing
school
and
i
ve
been
made
free
to
run
in
and
out
as
if
i
were
your
brother
now
she
is
as
glum
and
stiff
and
always
stays
in
the
room
every
minute
of
the
time
that
i
am
there
as
if
she
was
afraid
i
should
be
in
some
mischief
it
s
too
bad
oh
james
i
am
sorry
that
you
only
go
to
meeting
for
the
sake
of
seeing
me
you
feel
no
real
interest
in
religious
things
and
besides
mother
thinks
now
i
am
grown
so
old
you
know
things
are
different
now
least
we
mustn
t
you
know
always
do
as
we
did
when
we
were
children
but
i
wish
you
did
feel
more
interested
in
good
i
interested
in
one
or
two
good
things
mary
in
you
who
are
the
best
i
know
of
besides
he
said
quickly
and
scanning
her
face
attentively
to
see
the
effect
of
his
words
don
t
you
think
there
is
more
merit
in
my
sitting
out
all
these
meetings
when
they
bore
me
so
confoundedly
than
there
is
in
your
and
aunt
katy
s
doing
it
who
really
seem
to
find
something
to
like
in
them
i
believe
you
have
a
sixth
sense
quite
unknown
to
me
for
it
s
all
a
maze
can
t
find
top
nor
bottom
nor
side
nor
up
nor
down
to
it
s
you
can
and
you
can
t
you
shall
and
you
shan
t
you
will
and
you
won
t
james
you
needn
t
look
at
me
so
i
m
not
going
to
say
the
rest
of
it
but
seriously
it
s
all
anywhere
and
nowhere
to
me
it
don
t
touch
me
it
don
t
help
me
and
i
think
it
rather
makes
me
worse
and
then
they
tell
me
it
s
because
i
m
a
natural
man
and
the
natural
man
understandeth
not
the
things
of
the
spirit
well
i
a
natural
man
s
a
fellow
to
help
it
well
james
why
need
you
talk
everywhere
as
you
do
you
joke
and
jest
and
trifle
till
it
seems
to
everybody
that
you
don
t
believe
in
anything
i
m
afraid
mother
thinks
you
are
an
infidel
but
i
it
can
t
be
yet
we
hear
all
sorts
of
things
that
you
i
suppose
you
mean
my
telling
deacon
twitchel
that
i
had
seen
as
good
christians
among
the
mahometans
as
any
in
newport
i
make
him
open
his
eyes
it
s
true
too
in
every
nation
he
that
feareth
god
and
worketh
righteousness
is
accepted
of
him
said
mary
and
if
there
are
better
christians
than
us
among
the
mahometans
i
am
sure
i
am
glad
of
it
but
after
all
the
great
question
is
are
we
christians
ourselves
oh
james
if
you
only
were
a
real
true
noble
christian
well
mary
you
have
got
into
that
harbour
through
all
the
sandbars
and
rocks
and
crooked
channels
and
now
do
you
think
it
right
to
leave
a
fellow
beating
about
outside
and
not
go
out
to
help
him
in
this
way
of
drawing
up
among
your
good
people
and
leaving
us
sinners
to
ourselves
isn
t
generous
you
might
care
a
little
for
the
soul
of
an
old
friend
anyhow
and
don
t
i
care
james
how
many
days
and
nights
have
been
one
prayer
for
you
if
i
could
take
my
hopes
of
heaven
out
of
my
own
heart
and
give
them
to
you
i
would
preached
last
sunday
on
the
text
i
could
wish
myself
accursed
from
christ
for
my
brethren
my
kinsmen
and
he
went
on
to
show
how
we
must
be
willing
to
give
up
even
our
own
salvation
if
necessary
for
the
good
of
others
people
said
it
was
hard
doctrine
but
i
could
feel
my
way
through
it
very
well
yes
i
would
give
my
soul
for
yours
i
wish
i
there
was
a
solemnity
and
pathos
in
mary
s
manner
which
checked
the
conversation
james
was
the
more
touched
because
he
felt
it
all
so
real
from
one
whose
words
were
always
yea
and
nay
so
true
so
inflexibly
simple
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
her
face
kindled
with
a
sad
earnestness
and
james
thought
as
he
looked
of
a
picture
he
had
once
seen
in
a
european
cathedral
where
the
youthful
mother
of
sorrows
is
represented
radiant
and
grave
as
pitying
man
s
decline
all
youth
but
with
an
aspect
beyond
time
mournful
but
mournful
of
another
s
crime
she
looked
as
if
she
sat
by
eden
s
door
and
grieved
for
those
who
should
return
no
james
had
thought
he
loved
mary
he
had
admired
her
remarkable
beauty
he
had
been
proud
of
a
certain
right
in
her
before
that
of
other
young
men
her
associates
he
had
thought
of
her
as
the
keeper
of
his
home
he
had
wished
to
appropriate
her
wholly
to
himself
in
all
this
there
had
been
after
all
only
the
thought
of
what
she
was
to
be
to
him
and
this
for
this
poor
measure
of
what
he
called
love
she
was
ready
to
offer
an
infinite
sacrifice
as
a
subtle
flash
of
lightning
will
show
in
a
moment
a
whole
town
winding
stream
and
distant
that
one
subtle
ray
of
feeling
seemed
in
a
moment
to
reveal
to
james
the
whole
of
his
past
life
and
it
seemed
to
him
so
poor
so
meagre
so
shallow
by
the
side
of
that
childlike
woman
to
whom
the
noblest
of
feelings
were
unconscious
matters
of
course
that
a
sort
of
awe
awoke
in
him
like
the
apostles
of
old
he
feared
as
he
entered
into
the
cloud
it
seemed
as
if
the
deepest
string
of
some
eternal
sorrow
had
vibrated
between
them
after
a
moment
s
pause
he
spoke
in
a
low
and
altered
voice
mary
i
am
a
sinner
no
psalm
or
sermon
ever
taught
it
to
me
but
i
see
it
now
your
mother
is
quite
right
mary
you
are
too
good
for
me
i
am
no
mate
for
you
oh
what
would
you
think
of
me
if
you
knew
me
wholly
i
have
lived
a
mean
miserable
shallow
unworthy
life
you
are
worthy
you
are
a
saint
and
walk
in
white
oh
what
upon
earth
could
ever
make
you
care
so
much
for
me
well
then
james
you
will
be
good
won
t
you
talk
with
hang
said
james
now
mary
i
beg
your
pardon
but
i
can
t
make
head
or
tail
of
a
word
says
i
don
t
get
hold
of
it
or
know
what
he
would
be
at
you
girls
and
women
don
t
know
your
power
why
mary
you
are
a
living
gospel
you
have
always
had
a
strange
power
over
us
boys
you
never
talked
religion
much
but
i
have
seen
high
fellows
come
away
from
being
with
you
as
still
and
quiet
as
one
feels
when
one
goes
into
a
church
i
can
t
understand
all
the
hang
of
predestination
and
moral
ability
and
natural
ability
and
god
s
efficiency
and
man
s
agency
which
is
so
engaged
about
but
i
can
understand
can
do
me
good
oh
james
can
i
mary
i
am
going
to
confess
my
sins
i
saw
that
somehow
or
other
the
wind
was
against
me
in
aunt
katy
s
quarter
and
you
know
we
fellows
who
take
up
the
world
in
both
fists
don
t
like
to
be
beat
if
there
s
opposition
it
sets
us
on
now
i
confess
i
never
did
care
much
about
religion
but
i
thought
without
being
really
a
hypocrite
i
d
just
let
you
try
to
save
my
soul
for
the
sake
of
getting
you
for
there
s
nothing
surer
to
hook
a
woman
than
trying
to
save
a
fellow
s
soul
it
s
a
generally
that
now
our
ship
sails
and
i
thought
i
d
just
come
across
this
path
in
the
orchard
to
speak
to
you
you
know
i
used
always
to
bring
you
peaches
and
juneatings
across
this
way
and
once
i
brought
you
a
yes
i
ve
got
it
yet
well
now
mary
all
this
seems
mean
to
me
to
try
and
trick
and
snare
you
who
are
so
much
too
good
for
me
i
felt
very
proud
this
morning
that
i
was
to
go
out
first
mate
this
time
and
that
i
should
command
a
ship
next
voyage
i
meant
to
have
asked
you
for
a
promise
but
i
don
t
only
mary
just
give
me
your
little
bible
and
i
ll
promise
to
read
it
all
through
soberly
and
see
what
it
all
comes
to
and
pray
for
me
and
if
while
i
m
gone
a
good
man
comes
who
loves
you
and
is
worthy
of
you
why
take
him
mary
s
my
james
i
m
not
thinking
of
any
such
things
i
don
t
ever
mean
to
be
married
and
i
m
glad
you
don
t
ask
me
for
any
promise
because
it
would
be
wrong
to
give
it
mother
don
t
even
like
me
to
be
much
with
you
but
i
m
sure
all
i
have
said
to
you
is
right
i
shall
tell
her
exactly
all
i
have
if
aunt
katy
knew
what
things
we
fellows
are
pitched
into
who
take
the
world
she
wouldn
t
be
so
selfish
mary
you
girls
and
women
don
t
know
the
world
you
live
in
you
ought
to
be
pure
and
good
you
are
not
as
we
are
you
don
t
know
what
men
what
women
they
re
not
women
creatures
beset
us
in
every
foreign
port
and
that
are
gates
of
hell
and
then
if
a
fellow
comes
back
from
all
this
and
don
t
walk
exactly
straight
you
just
draw
up
the
hems
of
your
garments
and
stand
close
to
the
wall
for
fear
he
should
touch
you
when
he
passes
i
don
t
mean
you
mary
for
you
are
different
from
most
but
if
you
would
do
what
you
could
you
might
save
it
s
no
use
talking
mary
give
me
the
bible
and
please
be
kind
to
my
dove
i
had
a
hard
time
getting
him
across
the
water
and
i
don
t
want
him
to
if
mary
had
spoken
all
that
welled
up
in
her
little
heart
at
that
moment
she
might
have
said
too
much
but
duty
had
its
habitual
seal
upon
her
lips
she
took
the
little
bible
from
her
table
and
gave
it
with
a
trembling
hand
and
james
turned
to
go
in
a
moment
he
turned
back
and
stood
irresolute
mary
he
said
we
are
cousins
i
may
never
come
back
you
might
kiss
me
this
the
kiss
was
given
and
received
in
silence
and
james
disappeared
among
the
thick
trees
come
child
said
aunt
katy
looking
in
there
is
deacon
twitchel
s
chaise
in
sight
you
ready
yes
chapter
iv
theological
tea
at
the
call
of
her
mother
mary
hurried
into
the
best
room
with
a
strange
discomposure
of
spirit
she
had
never
felt
before
from
childhood
her
love
for
james
had
been
so
deep
equable
and
intense
that
it
had
never
disturbed
her
with
thrills
and
yearnings
it
had
grown
up
in
sisterly
calmness
and
quietly
expanding
had
taken
possession
of
her
whole
nature
without
her
once
dreaming
of
its
power
but
this
last
interview
seemed
to
have
struck
some
great
nerve
of
her
being
calm
as
she
usually
was
from
habit
principle
and
good
health
she
shivered
and
trembled
as
she
heard
his
retreating
footsteps
and
saw
the
fly
back
from
under
his
feet
it
was
as
if
each
step
trod
on
a
nerve
if
the
very
sound
of
the
rustling
grass
was
stirring
something
living
and
sensitive
in
her
soul
and
strangest
of
all
a
vague
impression
of
guilt
hovered
over
her
she
done
anything
wrong
she
did
not
ask
him
there
she
had
not
spoken
love
to
him
no
she
had
only
talked
to
him
of
his
soul
and
how
she
would
give
hers
for
his
so
willingly
that
was
not
love
it
was
only
what
said
christians
must
always
feel
child
what
you
been
doing
said
aunt
katy
who
sat
in
full
flowing
chintz
petticoat
and
spotless
dimity
with
her
company
in
her
hands
your
cheeks
are
as
red
as
peonies
have
you
been
crying
what
s
the
matter
there
is
the
deacon
s
wife
mother
said
mary
turning
confusedly
and
darting
to
the
enter
twitchel
soft
pillowy
little
elderly
lady
whose
whole
air
and
dress
reminded
one
of
a
sack
of
feathers
tied
in
the
middle
with
a
string
a
large
comfortable
pocket
hung
upon
the
side
disclosed
her
ready
for
operation
and
she
zealously
cleansed
herself
with
a
checked
handkerchief
from
the
dust
which
had
accumulated
during
her
ride
in
the
old
shay
answering
the
hospitable
salutation
of
katy
scudder
in
that
plaintive
motherly
voice
which
belongs
to
certain
nice
old
ladies
who
appear
to
live
in
a
state
of
mild
chronic
compassion
for
the
sins
and
sorrows
of
this
mortal
life
generally
why
yes
miss
scudder
i
m
pretty
tol
able
i
keep

my
way
i

i
didn
t
see
how

afternoon
but

see
miss
scudder
and
talk
a
little
about
that
precious
sermon

how

the
doctor
blessed

his
reward

be
great
in
heaven
if
not
on
earth
as
i
was
the
deacon
and
he
says
to
me
says
he

t
be
there

n
t

i
to
cerinthy
ann

t
mind
cause
her
heart

set
on
better
i
always
like
to
drop
a
word
in
season
to
cerinthy
ann
cause
she
s
clean
took
up
with
vanity
and
dress
oh
dear
oh
dear
me
so
different
from
your
blessed
daughter
miss
scudder
well
it
s
a
great
blessin
to
be
called

youth
like
samuel
and
timothy
but
then
we
doesn
t

the
lord

ways
sometimes
i
gets
clean
discouraged
with
my
children
then
ag
in
i
don
t
know
none
on
us
does
cerinthy
ann
is
one
of
the
most
master
hands
to
turn
off
work
she
takes
hold
and
goes
along
like
a
woman
and
nobody
never
knows
when
that
gal
finds
the
time
to
do
all
she
does
do
and
i
don
t
know
nothin
what
i
do
without
her
deacon
was
saying
if
ever
she
was
called
she
d
be
a
martha
and
not
a
mary
but
then
she
s
dreadful
opposed
to
the
doctrines
oh
dear
me
oh
dear
me
somehow
they
seem
to
rile
her
all
up
and
she
was
me
yesterday
when
she
was
out
clothes
that
she
never
should
get
reconciled
to
decrees
and
lection
cause
she
can
t
see
if
things
is
certain
how
folks
is
to
help
emselves
says
i
cerinthy
ann
folks
a
n
t
to
help
themselves
they
s
to
submit
and
she
jest
slammed
down
the
and
went
into
the
when
twitchel
began
to
talk
it
flowed
a
steady
stream
as
when
one
turns
a
faucet
that
never
ceases
running
till
some
hand
turns
it
back
again
and
the
occasion
that
cut
the
flood
short
at
present
was
the
entrance
of
brown
simeon
brown
was
a
thriving
of
newport
who
lived
in
a
large
house
owned
several
and
a
span
of
horses
and
affected
some
state
and
style
in
his
worldly
appearance
a
passion
for
metaphysical
orthodoxy
had
drawn
simeon
to
the
congregation
of
and
his
wife
of
course
stood
by
right
in
a
high
place
there
she
was
a
tall
angular
somewhat
body
dressed
in
a
style
rather
above
the
simple
habits
of
her
neighbours
and
her
whole
air
spoke
the
great
woman
who
in
right
of
her
thousands
expected
to
have
her
say
in
all
that
was
going
on
in
the
world
whether
she
understood
it
or
not
on
her
entrance
mild
little
twitchel
fled
from
the
cushioned
and
stood
with
the
quivering
air
of
one
who
feels
she
has
no
business
to
be
anywhere
in
the
world
until
brown
s
bonnet
was
taken
and
she
was
seated
when
twitchel
subsided
into
a
corner
and
rattled
her
to
conceal
her
emotion
new
england
has
been
called
the
land
of
equality
but
what
land
upon
earth
is
wholly
so
even
the
mites
in
a
bit
of
cheese
naturalists
say
have
great
tumblings
and
strivings
about
position
and
rank
he
who
has
ten
pounds
will
always
be
a
nobleman
to
him
who
has
but
one
let
him
strive
as
manfully
as
he
may
and
therefore
let
us
forgive
meek
little
twitchel
from
melting
into
nothing
in
her
own
eyes
when
brown
came
in
and
let
us
forgive
brown
that
she
sat
down
in
the
with
an
easy
grandeur
as
one
who
thought
it
her
duty
to
be
affable
and
meant
to
be
it
was
however
rather
difficult
for
brown
with
her
money
house
negroes
and
all
to
patronise
katy
scudder
who
was
one
of
those
women
whose
natures
seems
to
sit
on
thrones
and
who
dispense
patronage
and
favour
by
an
inborn
right
and
aptitude
whatever
be
their
social
advantages
it
was
one
of
brown
s
trials
of
life
this
secret
strange
quality
in
her
neighbour
who
stood
apparently
so
far
below
her
in
worldly
goods
even
the
quiet
positive
style
of
katy
s
knitting
made
her
nervous
it
was
an
implication
of
independence
of
her
sway
and
though
on
the
present
occasion
every
customary
courtesy
was
bestowed
she
still
felt
as
she
always
did
when
katy
s
guest
a
secret
uneasiness
she
mentally
contrasted
the
neat
little
parlour
with
its
white
sanded
floor
and
muslin
curtains
with
her
own
grand
which
boasted
the
then
uncommon
luxuries
of
turkey
carpet
and
persian
rug
and
wondered
if
katy
did
really
feel
as
cool
and
easy
in
receiving
her
as
she
appeared
you
must
not
understand
that
this
was
what
brown
herself
to
be
thinking
about
oh
no
by
no
means
all
the
little
mean
work
of
our
nature
is
generally
done
in
a
small
dark
closet
just
a
little
back
of
the
subject
we
are
talking
about
on
which
subject
we
suppose
ourselves
of
course
to
be
thinking
course
we
thinking
of
it
how
else
could
we
talk
about
it
the
subject
in
discussion
and
what
brown
supposed
to
be
in
her
own
thoughts
was
the
last
sunday
s
sermon
on
the
doctrine
of
entire
disinterested
benevolence
in
which
good
doctor
had
proclaimed
to
the
citizens
of
newport
their
duty
of
being
so
wholly
absorbed
in
the
general
good
of
the
universe
as
even
to
acquiesce
in
their
own
final
and
eternal
destruction
if
the
greater
good
of
the
whole
might
thereby
be
accomplished
well
now
dear
me
said
twitchel
while
her
trotted
contentedly
to
the
mournful
tone
of
her
voice
i
was
tellin
the
deacon
if
we
only
could
get
there
sometimes
i
think
i
get
a
little
way
then
ag
in
i
don
t
know
but
the
deacon
he
s
quite
down
don
t
see
no
evidences
in
himself
sometimes
he
says
he
don
t
feel
as
if
he
ought
to
keep
his
place
in
the
church
then
ag
in
he
don
t
know
he
keeps
and
turnin
on
t
over
in
his
mind
and
himself
this
way
and
that
way
and
he
says
he
don
t
see
nothin
but
what
s
selfish
no
way
member
one
night
last
winter
after
the
deacon
got
warm
in
bed
there
come
a
rap
at
the
door
and
who
should
it
be
but
old
beulah
ward
wantin
to
see
the
twas
her
boy
she
sent
and
he
said
beulah
was
sick
and
hadn
t
no
more
wood
nor
candles
now
i
know
d
the
deacon
had
carried
that
critter
half
a
cord
of
wood
if
he
had
one
stick
since
thanksgivin
and
i
d
sent
her
two
o
my
best
moulds
of
candles
ones
that
cerinthy
ann
run
when
we
killed
a
crittur
but
nothin
would
do
but
the
deacon
must
get
right
out
his
warm
bed
and
dress
himself
and
hitch
up
his
team
to
carry
over
some
wood
to
beulah
says
i
father
you
know
you
ll
be
down
with
the
rheumatis
for
this
besides
beulah
is
real
aggravatin
i
know
she
trades
off
what
we
send
her
to
the
store
for
rum
and
you
never
get
no
thanks
she
xpects
cause
we
has
done
for
her
we
always
must
and
more
we
do
more
we
may
and
says
he
to
me
says
he
that
s
jest
the
way
we
sarves
the
lord
polly
and
what
if
he
shouldn
t
hear
us
when
we
call
on
him
in
our
troubles
so
i
shet
up
and
the
next
day
he
was
down
with
the
rheumatis
and
cerinthy
ann
says
she
well
father
i
hope
you
ll
own
you
have
got
disinterested
benevolence
says
she
and
the
deacon
he
thought
it
over
a
spell
and
then
he
says
i
m
fraid
it
s
all
selfish
i
m
jest
a
righteousness
of
and
cerinthy
ann
she
come
out
declarin
that
the
best
folks
never
had
no
comfort
in
religion
and
for
her
part
she
didn
t
mean
to
trouble
her
head
about
it
but
have
jest
as
good
a
time
as
she
could
while
she
s
young
cause
if
she
was
lected
to
be
saved
she
should
be
and
if
she
wa
n
t
she
couldn
t
help
it
any
mr
brown
says
he
came
on
to
s
ground
years
ago
said
brown
giving
a
nervous
twitch
to
her
yarn
and
speaking
in
a
sharp
hard
didactic
voice
which
made
little
twitchel
give
a
gentle
quiver
and
look
humble
and
apologetic
mr
brown
s
a
master
thinker
there
s
nothing
pleases
that
man
better
than
a
hard
doctrine
he
says
you
can
t
get
em
too
hard
for
him
he
don
t
find
any
difficulty
in
bringing
his
mind
up
he
just
reasons
it
out
all
plain
and
he
says
people
have
no
need
to
be
in
the
dark
and
that
s
opinion
if
folks
know
they
ought
to
come
up
to
anything
why
they
he
says
and
i
say
so
mr
scudder
used
to
say
that
it
took
great
afflictions
to
bring
his
mind
to
that
place
said
katy
he
used
to
say
that
an
old
told
him
once
that
paper
that
was
shaken
only
one
way
in
the
making
would
tear
across
the
other
and
the
best
paper
had
to
be
shaken
every
way
and
so
he
said
we
couldn
t
tell
till
we
had
been
turned
and
shaken
and
tried
every
way
where
we
should
twitchel
responded
to
this
sentiment
with
a
gentle
series
of
groans
such
as
were
her
general
expression
of
approbation
swaying
herself
backward
and
forward
while
brown
gave
a
sort
of
toss
and
snort
and
said
that
for
her
part
she
always
thought
people
knew
what
they
did
know
she
guessed
she
was
mistaken
the
conversation
was
here
interrupted
by
the
civilities
attendant
on
the
reception
of
jones
broad
buxom
hearty
soul
who
had
come
on
horseback
from
a
farm
about
three
miles
distant
smiling
with
rosy
content
she
presented
katy
a
small
pot
of
golden
butter
result
of
her
forenoon
s
churning
there
are
some
people
so
evidently
broadly
and
heartily
of
this
world
that
their
coming
into
a
room
always
materializes
the
conversation
we
wish
to
be
understood
that
we
mean
no
disparaging
reflection
on
such
persons
are
as
necessary
to
make
up
a
world
as
cabbages
to
make
up
a
garden
the
great
healthy
principles
of
cheerfulness
and
animal
life
seem
to
exist
in
them
in
the
gross
they
are
wedges
and
ingots
of
solid
contented
vitality
certain
kinds
of
virtues
and
christian
graces
thrive
in
such
people
as
the
first
crop
of
corn
does
in
the
of
the
ohio
jones
was
a
a
regular
and
planted
her
comely
person
plump
in
front
of
every
sunday
and
listened
to
his
searching
and
discriminating
sermons
with
broad
honest
smiles
of
satisfaction
those
keen
distinctions
as
to
motives
those
awful
warnings
and
urgent
expostulations
which
made
poor
deacon
twitchel
weep
she
listened
to
with
great
round
satisfied
eyes
making
to
all
and
after
all
the
same
remark
it
was
good
and
she
liked
it
and
the
doctor
was
a
good
man
and
on
the
present
occasion
she
announced
her
pot
of
butter
as
one
fruit
of
her
reflections
after
the
last
discourse
you
see
she
said
as
i
was
in
the
this
mornin
my
butter
i
says
to
dinah
i
m
goin
to
carry
a
pot
of
this
down
to
miss
scudder
for
the
doctor
got
so
much
good
out
of
his
sunday
s
and
dinah
she
says
to
me
says
she
laws
miss
jones
i
thought
you
was
asleep
for
sartin
but
i
wasn
t
only
i
forgot
to
take
any
in
the
mornin
and
so
i
kinder
missed
it
you
know
it
livens
one
up
but
i
never
lost
myself
so
but
what
i
kinder
heerd
him
goin
on
on
sort
o
like
it
sounded
sort
o
and
so
i
thought
of
the
doctor
well
i
m
sure
said
aunt
katy
this
will
be
a
treat
we
all
know
about
your
butter
jones
i
sha
n
t
think
of
putting
any
of
mine
on
table
i
m
law
now
don
t
said
jones
why
you
re
lly
make
me
ashamed
miss
scudder
to
be
sure
folks
does
like
our
butter
and
it
always
fetches
a
pretty
good
price
very
proud
on
t
i
tell
him
he
oughtn
t
to
be
oughtn
t
to
be
proud
of
and
now
katy
giving
a
look
at
the
old
clock
told
mary
it
was
time
to
set
the
and
forthwith
there
was
a
gentle
movement
of
expectancy
the
little
mahogany
opened
its
brown
wings
and
from
a
drawer
came
forth
the
snowy
damask
covering
it
was
etiquette
on
such
occasions
to
compliment
every
article
of
the
establishment
successively
as
it
appeared
so
the
deacon
s
wife
began
at
the
well
i
do
declare
miss
scudder
beats
us
all
in
her
she
said
taking
up
a
corner
of
the
damask
admiringly
and
jones
forthwith
jumped
up
and
seized
the
other
corner
why
this
ere
must
have
come
from
the
old
country
it
s
most
the
beautiflest
thing
i
ever
did
it
s
my
own
spinning
replied
katy
with
conscious
dignity
there
was
an
irish
weaver
came
to
newport
the
year
before
i
was
married
who
wove
beautifully
the
patterns
i
d
been
spinning
some
uncommonly
fine
flax
then
i
remember
scudder
used
to
read
to
me
while
i
was
spinning
aunt
katy
looked
afar
as
one
whose
thoughts
are
in
the
past
and
dropped
out
the
last
words
with
a
little
sigh
unconsciously
as
to
herself
wall
now
i
must
say
said
jones
this
goes
quite
beyond
me
i
thought
i
could
spin
some
but
i
shan
t
never
dare
to
show
i
m
sure
jones
your
towels
that
you
had
out
bleaching
this
spring
were
wonderful
said
aunt
katy
but
i
don
t
pretend
to
do
much
now
she
continued
straightening
her
trim
figure
i
m
getting
old
you
know
we
must
let
the
young
folks
take
up
these
things
mary
spins
better
now
than
i
ever
did
mary
hand
out
those
and
so
mary
s
napkins
passed
from
hand
to
hand
well
well
said
twitchel
to
mary
it
s
easy
to
see
that
will
be
pretty
full
by
the
time
comes
along
won
t
it
miss
jones
mrs
twitchel
looked
pleasantly
facetious
as
elderly
ladies
generally
do
when
suggesting
such
possibilities
to
younger
ones
mary
was
vexed
to
feel
the
blood
boil
up
in
her
cheeks
in
a
most
unexpected
and
provoking
way
at
the
suggestion
whereat
twitchel
nodded
knowingly
at
jones
and
whispered
something
in
a
mysterious
aside
to
which
plump
jones
answered
why
do
tell
now
i
never
it
s
strange
said
twitchel
taking
up
her
parable
again
in
such
a
plaintive
tone
that
all
knew
something
pathetic
was
coming
what
mistakes
some
folks
will
make
up
girls
now
there
s
your
mary
miss
scudder
there
a
n
t
nothin
she
can
t
do
but
law
i
was
down
to
miss
skinner
s
last
week
with
her
and
re
lly
it
most
broke
my
heart
to
see
her
her
mother
was
a
most
amazin
smart
woman
but
she
brought
suky
up
for
all
the
world
as
if
she
d
been
a
wax
doll
to
be
kept
in
the
drawer
sure
enough
she
was
a
pretty
cretur
now
she
s
married
what
is
she
she
ha
n
t
no
more
idee
how
to
take
hold
than
nothin
the
poor
child
means
well
enough
and
she
works
so
hard
she
most
kills
herself
but
then
she
is
in
the
suds
from
mornin
till
night
s
one
the
sort
whose
work
s
never
done
poor
george
skinner
s
clean
there
s
everything
in
said
katy
nobody
ought
to
be
always
working
it
s
a
bad
sign
i
tell
mary
always
do
up
your
work
in
the
girls
must
learn
that
i
never
work
afternoons
after
my
dinner
dishes
are
got
away
i
never
did
and
never
nor
i
neither
chimed
in
jones
and
twitchel
anxious
to
show
themselves
clear
on
this
leading
point
of
housekeeping
there
s
another
thing
i
always
tell
mary
said
katy
impressively
never
say
there
isn
t
time
for
a
thing
that
ought
to
be
done
if
a
thing
is
why
life
is
long
enough
to
find
a
place
for
it
that
s
my
doctrine
when
anybody
tells
me
they
can
t
for
this
or
that
i
don
t
think
much
of
em
i
think
they
don
t
know
how
to
work
s
here
twitchel
looked
up
from
her
knitting
with
apologetic
giggle
at
brown
law
now
there
s
miss
brown
she
don
t
know
nothin
about
it
cause
she
s
got
her
servants
to
every
turn
i
s
pose
she
thinks
it
queer
to
hear
us
talkin
about
our
work
miss
brown
must
have
her
time
all
to
herself
i
was
tellin
the
deacon
the
other
day
that
she
was
a
privileged
i
m
sure
those
that
have
servants
find
work
enough
following
em
round
said
brown
like
all
other
human
beings
resented
the
implication
of
not
having
as
many
trials
in
life
as
her
neighbours
as
to
getting
the
work
done
up
in
the
forenoon
that
s
a
thing
i
never
can
teach
em
they
d
rather
not
chloe
likes
to
keep
her
work
round
and
do
it
by
snacks
any
time
day
or
night
when
the
notion
takes
and
it
was
just
for
that
reason
i
never
would
have
one
of
those
creatures
round
said
katy
mr
scudder
was
principled
against
buying
negroes
if
he
had
been
i
should
not
have
wanted
any
of
work
i
know
what
s
to
be
done
and
most
help
is
no
help
to
me
i
want
people
to
stand
out
of
my
way
and
let
me
get
done
i
ve
tried
keeping
a
girl
once
or
twice
and
i
never
worked
so
hard
in
my
life
when
mary
and
i
do
all
ourselves
we
can
calculate
everything
to
a
minute
and
we
get
our
time
to
sew
and
read
and
spin
and
visit
and
live
just
as
we
want
here
again
brown
looked
uneasy
to
what
use
was
it
that
she
was
rich
and
owned
servants
when
this
mordecai
in
her
gate
utterly
despised
her
prosperity
in
her
secret
heart
she
thought
katy
must
be
envious
and
rather
comforted
herself
on
this
view
of
the
subject
unconscious
of
any
inconsistency
in
the
feeling
with
her
views
of
utter
just
announced
meanwhile
the
had
been
silently
gathering
on
its
snowy
plateau
the
delicate
china
the
golden
butter
the
loaf
of
faultless
cake
a
plate
of
crullers
or
wonders
as
a
sort
of
sweet
fried
cake
was
commonly
called
light
as
a
puff
and
shining
on
top
with
a
varnish
of
eggs
of
apple
and
quince
quivering
in
amber
clearness
and
purest
honey
in
the
comb
short
everything
that
could
go
to
the
of
a
most
faultless
tea
i
don
t
see
said
jones
resuming
the
gentle
pæans
of
the
occasion
how
miss
scudder
s
always
comes
out
just
so
it
don
t
rise
neither
to
one
side
nor
t
other
but
just
even
all
round
and
it
a
n
t
white
one
side
and
burnt
the
other
but
just
a
good
brown
all
over
and
it
don
t
have
any
heavy
streak
in
jest
what
cerinthy
ann
was
sayin
the
other
day
said
twichel
she
says
she
can
t
never
be
sure
how
hers
is
out
do
what
she
can
it
will
be
either
too
much
or
too
little
but
miss
scudder
s
is
always
jest
so
law
says
i
cerinthy
ann
it
s
s
it
that
has
it
has
it
and
them
that
hasn
they
ve
got
to
work
hard
and
not
do
half
so
well
katy
took
all
these
praises
as
matter
of
course
since
she
was
thirteen
years
old
she
had
never
put
her
hand
to
anything
that
she
had
not
been
held
to
do
better
than
other
folks
and
therefore
she
accepted
her
praises
with
the
quiet
repose
and
serenity
of
assured
reputation
though
of
course
she
used
the
usual
polite
disclaimers
of
oh
it
s
nothing
nothing
at
all
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
how
i
do
it
and
was
not
aware
it
was
so
good
and
so
on
all
which
things
are
proper
for
gentlewomen
to
observe
in
like
cases
in
every
walk
of
life
do
you
think
the
deacon
will
be
along
soon
said
katy
when
mary
returning
from
the
kitchen
announced
the
important
fact
that
the
was
boiling
why
yes
said
twitchel
i
m
for
him
every
minute
he
told
me
that
he
and
the
men
should
be
plantin
up
to
the
lot
but
he
d
keep
the
colt
up
there
to
come
down
on
and
so
i
laid
him
out
a
clean
shirt
and
says
now
father
you
be
sure
and
be
there
by
five
so
that
miss
scudder
may
know
when
to
put
her
tea
he
is
i
believe
she
added
as
a
horse
s
tramp
was
heard
without
and
after
a
few
moments
the
desired
deacon
entered
he
was
a
gentle
man
low
sinewy
thin
with
black
hair
showing
lines
and
patches
of
silver
his
keen
thoughtful
dark
eye
marked
the
nervous
and
melancholic
temperament
a
mild
and
pensive
humility
of
manner
seemed
to
brood
over
him
like
the
shadow
of
a
cloud
everything
in
his
dress
air
and
motions
indicated
punctilious
exactness
and
accuracy
at
times
rising
to
the
point
of
nervous
anxiety
immediately
after
the
bustle
of
his
entrance
had
subsided
simeon
brown
followed
he
was
a
tall
lank
individual
with
bones
thin
sharp
features
small
keen
hard
eyes
and
large
hands
and
feet
simeon
was
as
we
have
before
remarked
a
keen
theologian
and
had
the
scent
of
a
hound
for
a
metaphysical
distinction
true
he
was
a
man
of
business
being
a
thriving
trader
to
the
coast
of
africa
whence
he
imported
negroes
for
the
american
market
and
no
man
was
held
to
understand
that
branch
of
traffic
better
having
in
his
earlier
days
commanded
ships
in
the
business
and
thus
learned
it
from
the
root
in
his
private
life
simeon
was
severe
and
dictatorial
he
was
one
of
that
class
of
people
who
of
a
freezing
day
will
plant
themselves
directly
between
you
and
the
fire
and
there
stand
and
argue
to
prove
that
selfishness
is
the
root
of
moral
evil
simeon
said
he
always
had
thought
so
and
his
neighbours
sometimes
supposed
that
nobody
could
enjoy
better
experimental
advantages
for
understanding
the
subject
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
suppose
themselves
submissive
to
the
divine
will
to
the
uttermost
extent
demanded
by
the
extreme
theology
of
that
day
simply
because
they
have
no
nerves
to
feel
no
imagination
to
conceive
what
endless
happiness
or
suffering
is
and
who
deal
therefore
with
the
great
question
of
the
salvation
or
damnation
of
myriads
as
a
problem
of
theological
algebra
to
be
worked
out
by
their
inevitable
but
we
must
not
spend
too
much
time
with
our
analysis
of
character
for
matters
at
the
are
drawing
to
a
crisis
jones
has
announced
that
she
does
not
think
can
come
this
afternoon
by
which
significant
mode
of
expression
she
conveyed
the
dutiful
idea
that
there
was
for
her
but
one
male
person
in
the
world
and
now
katy
says
mary
dear
knock
at
the
doctor
s
door
and
tell
him
that

the
doctor
was
sitting
in
his
shady
study
in
the
room
on
the
other
side
of
the
little
entry
the
windows
were
dark
and
fragrant
with
the
shade
and
perfume
of
blossoming
lilacs
whose
tremulous
shadow
mingled
with
spots
of
afternoon
sunlight
danced
on
the
scattered
papers
of
a
great
covered
with
pamphlets
and
volumes
of
theology
where
the
doctor
was
sitting
a
man
of
gigantic
proportions
over
six
feet
in
height
and
built
every
way
with
an
amplitude
corresponding
to
his
height
sitting
bent
over
his
writing
so
absorbed
that
he
did
not
hear
the
gentle
sound
of
mary
s
entrance
doctor
said
the
maiden
gently
tea
is
no
motion
no
sound
except
the
quick
tracing
of
the
pen
over
the
paper
doctor
doctor
a
little
louder
and
with
another
step
into
the
apartment
tea
is
the
doctor
stretched
his
head
forward
to
a
paper
which
lay
before
him
and
responded
in
a
low
murmuring
voice
as
reading
something
firstly
underived
virtue
be
peculiar
to
the
deity
can
it
be
the
duty
of
a
creature
to
have
it
here
a
little
waxen
hand
came
with
a
very
gentle
tap
on
his
huge
shoulder
and
doctor
tea
is
ready
penetrated
drowsily
to
the
nerve
of
his
ear
as
a
sound
heard
in
sleep
he
rose
suddenly
with
a
start
opened
a
pair
of
great
blue
eyes
which
shone
abstractedly
under
the
dome
of
a
capacious
and
lofty
forehead
and
fixed
them
on
the
maiden
who
by
this
time
was
looking
up
rather
archly
and
yet
with
an
attitude
of
the
most
profound
respect
while
her
venerated
friend
was
assembling
together
his
earthly
faculties
tea
is
ready
if
you
please
mother
wished
me
to
call
oh
he
said
looking
confusedly
about
and
starting
for
the
door
in
his
study
gown
if
you
please
sir
said
mary
standing
in
his
way
would
you
not
like
to
put
on
your
coat
and
wig
the
doctor
gave
a
hurried
glance
at
his
study
gown
put
his
hand
to
his
head
which
in
place
of
the
ample
curls
of
his
wig
was
decked
only
with
a
very
ordinary
cap
and
seemed
to
come
at
once
to
full
comprehension
he
smiled
a
kind
of
conscious
benignant
smile
which
adorned
his
high
and
hard
features
as
sunshine
adorns
the
side
of
a
rock
and
said
kindly
ah
well
child
i
understand
now
i
ll
be
out
in
a
and
mary
sure
that
he
was
now
on
the
right
track
went
back
to
the
with
the
announcement
that
the
doctor
was
coming
in
a
few
moments
he
entered
majestic
and
proper
in
all
the
dignity
of
powdered
wig
full
flowing
coat
with
ample
cuffs
silver
knee
and
shoe
buckles
as
became
the
gravity
and
majesty
of
the
minister
of
those
days
he
saluted
all
the
company
with
a
benignity
which
had
a
touch
of
the
majestic
and
also
of
the
rustic
in
it
for
at
heart
the
doctor
was
a
bashful
man
that
is
he
had
somewhere
in
his
mental
camp
that
treacherous
fellow
whom
john
bunyan
anathematizes
under
the
name
of
shame
the
company
rose
on
his
entrance
the
men
bowed
and
the
women
curtsied
and
all
remained
standing
while
he
addressed
to
each
with
punctilious
decorum
those
inquiries
in
regard
to
health
and
which
preface
a
social
interview
then
at
a
dignified
sigh
from
katy
he
advanced
to
the
table
and
all
following
his
example
stood
while
with
one
hand
uplifted
he
went
through
a
devotional
exercise
which
for
length
more
resembled
a
prayer
than
a
grace
which
the
company
were
seated
well
doctor
said
brown
who
as
a
householder
of
substance
felt
a
conscious
right
to
be
first
in
open
conversation
with
the
minister
people
are
beginning
to
make
a
noise
about
your
views
i
was
talking
with
deacon
timmins
the
other
day
down
on
the
wharf
and
he
said
stiles
said
that
it
was
entirely
new
so
for
his
part
he
wanted
the
good
old
they
say
so
do
they
said
the
doctor
kindling
up
from
an
abstraction
into
which
he
seemed
to
be
gradually
subsiding
well
let
them
i
had
rather
publish
divinity
than
any
other
and
the
more
of
it
the
better
it
be
but
i
should
think
it
hardly
worth
while
to
write
if
i
had
nothing
to
well
said
deacon
twitchel
meek
face
flushing
with
awe
of
his
doctor
there
s
all
sorts
of
things
said
about
you
now
the
other
day
i
was
at
the
mill
with
a
load
of
corn
and
while
i
was
amariah
wadsworth
come
along
with
his
n
and
so
while
we
were
waitin
he
says
to
me
why
they
say
your
minister
is
gettin
to
be
an
arminian
and
he
went
on
how
old
ma
am
badger
told
him
that
you
interpreted
some
parts
of
paul
s
epistles
clear
on
the
arminian
side
you
know
ma
am
badger
s
a
at
doctrines
and
she
s
most
an
uncommon
that
does
not
frighten
me
at
all
said
the
sturdy
doctor
supposing
i
do
interpret
some
texts
like
the
arminians
can
t
arminians
have
anything
right
about
them
who
wouldn
t
rather
go
with
the
arminians
when
they
are
than
with
the
calvinists
when
they
are
wrong
that
s
it
ve
hit
it
doctor
said
simeon
brown
that
s
what
i

talks
with
seth
about
it
every
time
he
comes
to
see
me
and
he
says
that
if
we
did
not
sin
in
adam
it
s
givin
up
the
whole
ground
altogether
and
then
he
insists
you
re
clean
wrong
about
the
unregenerate

all

the
least
said
the
doctor
promptly
i

got
the
right
on
t
the
lord
ll
go
on
his
own
way
without
you
and
we
shall
find
out
by
what
that
mr
scudder
used
to
think
a
great
deal
on
these
points
said
katy
and
the
last
time
he
was
home
he
wrote
out
his
views
i
haven
t
ever
shown
them
to
you
doctor
but
i
should
be
pleased
to
know
what
you
think
of
mr
scudder
was
a
good
man
with
a
clear
head
said
the
doctor
and
i
should
be
much
pleased
to
see
anything
that
he
a
flush
of
gratified
feeling
passed
over
katy
s
face
one
flower
laid
on
the
shrine
which
we
keep
in
our
hearts
for
the
dead
is
worth
more
than
any
gift
to
our
living
selves
we
will
not
now
pursue
our
party
further
lest
you
reader
get
more
theological
tea
than
you
can
drink
we
will
not
recount
the
numerous
nice
points
raised
by
simeon
brown
and
adjusted
by
the
doctor
how
simeon
invariably
declared
that
that
was
the
way
in
which
he
disposed
of
them
himself
and
how
he
had
thought
it
out
ten
years
ago
we
will
not
relate
either
too
minutely
how
mary
changed
colour
and
grew
pale
and
red
in
quick
succession
when
simeon
brown
incidentally
remarked
that
the
monsoon
was
going
to
set
sail
that
very
afternoon
for
her
voyage
nobody
the
busy
sudden
welling
and
ebbing
of
that
one
poor
little
so
we
go
little
knowing
what
we
touch
and
what
touches
us
as
we
talk
we
drop
out
a
common
piece
of
news
mr
is
dead
is
married
a
ship
has
sailed
lo
on
our
right
hand
or
our
left
some
heart
has
sunk
under
the
news
silently
down
in
the
great
ocean
of
fate
without
even
a
bubble
rising
to
tell
its
drowning
pang
and
help
us
what
we
call
living
chapter
the
letter
mary
returned
to
the
quietude
of
her
room
the
red
of
twilight
had
faded
and
the
silver
moon
round
and
fair
was
rising
behind
the
thick
boughs
of
the
she
sat
down
in
the
window
thoughtful
and
sad
and
listened
to
the
crickets
whose
ignorant
jollity
often
sounds
as
mournfully
to
us
mortals
as
ours
may
to
superior
beings
there
the
little
hoarse
black
wretches
were
scraping
and
creaking
as
if
life
and
death
were
invented
solely
for
their
pleasure
and
the
world
were
created
only
to
give
them
a
good
time
in
it
now
and
then
a
little
wind
shivered
among
the
boughs
and
brought
down
a
shower
of
white
petals
which
shimmered
in
the
slant
beams
of
the
moonlight
and
now
a
ray
touched
some
tall
head
of
grass
and
forthwith
it
blossomed
into
silver
and
stirred
itself
with
a
quiet
joy
like
a
saint
just
awaking
in
paradise
and
ever
and
anon
came
on
the
still
air
the
soft
eternal
pulsations
of
the
distant
sea
mournfullest
most
mysterious
of
all
the
harpings
of
nature
it
was
the
sea
deep
eternal
sea
treacherous
soft
dreadful
inexplicable
sea
and
he
was
perhaps
at
this
moment
being
borne
away
on
it
away
what
sorrows
to
what
temptations
to
what
dangers
she
knew
not
she
looked
along
the
old
familiar
beaten
path
by
which
he
came
by
which
he
went
and
thought
what
if
he
should
come
back
there
was
a
little
path
through
the
orchard
out
to
a
small
elevation
in
the
behind
whence
the
sea
was
distinctly
visible
and
mary
had
often
used
her
window
as
a
door
when
she
wanted
to
pass
out
thither
so
now
she
stepped
out
and
gathering
her
skirts
back
from
the
dewy
grass
walked
thoughtfully
along
the
path
and
gained
the
hill
newport
harbour
lay
stretched
out
in
the
distance
with
the
rising
moon
casting
a
long
wavering
track
of
silver
upon
it
and
vessels
like
moths
were
turning
and
shifting
slowly
to
and
fro
upon
it
and
one
stately
ship
in
full
sail
passing
fairly
out
under
her
white
canvas
graceful
as
some
grand
snowy
bird
mary
s
beating
heart
told
her
that
was
passing
away
from
her
one
who
carried
a
portion
of
her
existence
with
him
she
sat
down
under
a
lonely
tree
that
stood
there
and
resting
her
elbow
on
her
knee
followed
the
ship
with
silent
prayers
as
it
passed
like
a
graceful
cloudy
dream
out
of
her
sight
then
she
thoughtfully
retraced
her
way
to
her
chamber
and
as
she
was
entering
observed
in
the
now
clearer
moonlight
what
she
had
not
seen
before
white
like
a
letter
lying
on
the
floor
immediately
she
struck
a
light
and
there
sure
enough
it
was
letter
in
james
s
handsome
dashing
hand
and
the
little
puss
before
she
knew
what
she
was
about
actually
kissed
it
with
a
fervour
which
would
much
have
astonished
the
writer
could
he
at
that
moment
have
been
clairvoyant
but
mary
felt
as
one
who
finds
in
the
emptiness
after
a
friend
s
death
an
unexpected
message
or
memento
and
all
alone
in
the
white
calm
stillness
of
her
little
room
her
heart
took
sudden
possession
of
her
she
opened
the
letter
with
trembling
hands
and
read
what
of
course
we
shall
let
you
read
we
got
it
out
of
a
bundle
of
old
smoky
yellow
letters
years
after
all
the
parties
concerned
were
gone
on
the
eternal
journey
beyond
earth
my
dear
mary
i
can
not
leave
you
so
i
have
about
two
hundred
things
to
say
to
you
and
it
s
a
shame
i
could
not
have
had
longer
to
see
you
but
blessed
be
ink
and
paper
i
am
writing
and
seeing
to
fifty
things
besides
so
you
musn
t
wonder
if
my
letter
has
rather
a
confused
appearance
i
have
been
thinking
that
perhaps
i
gave
you
a
wrong
impression
of
myself
this
afternoon
i
am
going
to
speak
to
you
from
my
heart
as
if
i
were
confessing
on
my
well
then
i
do
not
confess
to
being
what
is
commonly
called
a
bad
young
man
i
should
be
willing
that
men
of
the
world
generally
even
strict
ones
should
look
my
life
through
and
know
all
about
it
it
is
only
in
your
presence
mary
that
i
feel
that
i
am
bad
and
low
and
shallow
and
mean
because
you
represent
to
me
a
sphere
higher
and
holier
than
any
in
which
i
have
ever
moved
and
stir
up
a
sort
of
sighing
and
longing
in
my
heart
to
come
towards
it
in
all
countries
in
all
temptations
mary
your
image
has
stood
between
me
and
low
gross
vice
when
i
have
been
with
fellows
roaring
drunken
beastly
songs
i
have
seemed
to
see
you
as
you
used
to
sit
beside
me
in
the
and
your
voice
has
been
like
an
angel
s
in
my
ear
and
i
have
got
up
and
gone
out
sick
and
disgusted
your
face
has
risen
up
calm
and
white
and
still
between
the
faces
of
poor
lost
creatures
who
know
no
better
way
of
life
than
to
tempt
us
to
sin
and
sometimes
mary
when
i
have
seen
girls
that
had
they
been
cared
for
by
good
pious
mothers
might
have
been
like
you
i
have
felt
as
if
i
could
cry
for
them
poor
women
are
abused
all
the
world
over
and
it
s
no
wonder
they
turn
round
and
revenge
themselves
on
us
no
i
have
not
been
bad
mary
as
the
world
calls
badness
i
have
been
kept
by
you
but
do
you
remember
you
told
me
once
that
when
the
snow
first
fell
and
lay
so
dazzling
and
pure
and
soft
all
about
you
always
felt
as
if
the
spreads
and
that
seemed
white
before
were
dirty
well
it
s
just
like
that
with
me
your
presence
makes
me
feel
that
i
am
not
pure
i
am
low
and
unworthy
worthy
to
touch
the
hem
of
your
garment
your
good
spent
a
whole
the
other
sunday
trying
to
tell
us
about
the
beauty
of
holiness
and
he
cut
and
pared
and
peeled
and
sliced
and
told
us
what
it
wasn
t
and
what
was
it
and
wasn
t
and
then
he
built
up
an
exact
definition
and
fortified
and
bricked
it
up
all
round
and
i
thought
to
myself
that
he
d
better
tell
em
to
look
at
mary
scudder
and
they
d
understand
all
about
it
that
was
what
i
was
thinking
when
you
talked
to
me
for
looking
at
you
in
church
instead
of
looking
towards
the
pulpit
it
really
made
me
laugh
in
myself
to
see
what
a
good
little
ignorant
unconscious
way
you
had
of
looking
up
at
the
doctor
as
if
he
knew
more
about
that
than
you
did
and
now
as
to
your
doctor
that
you
think
so
much
of
i
like
him
for
certain
things
in
certain
ways
he
is
a
great
grand
large
pattern
of
a
man
man
who
isn
t
afraid
to
think
and
to
speak
anything
he
does
think
but
then
i
do
believe
if
he
would
take
a
voyage
round
the
world
in
the
forecastle
of
a
whaler
he
would
know
more
about
what
to
say
to
people
than
he
does
now
it
would
certainly
give
him
several
new
points
to
be
considered
much
of
his
preaching
about
men
is
as
like
live
men
as
chinese
pictures
of
trees
and
rocks
and
gardens
nearer
the
reality
than
that
all
i
can
say
is
it
isn
t
so
and
you
d
know
it
sir
if
you
knew
he
has
got
what
they
call
a
so
many
bricks
put
together
just
so
but
it
is
too
narrow
to
take
in
all
i
see
in
my
wanderings
round
this
world
of
ours
nobody
that
has
a
soul
and
goes
round
the
world
as
i
do
can
help
feeling
it
at
times
and
thinking
as
he
sees
all
the
races
of
men
and
their
ways
who
made
them
and
what
they
were
made
for
to
doubt
the
existence
of
a
god
seems
to
me
like
a
want
of
common
sense
there
is
a
maker
and
a
ruler
doubtless
but
then
mary
all
this
invisible
world
of
religion
is
unreal
to
me
i
can
see
we
must
be
good
somehow
if
we
are
not
we
shall
not
be
happy
here
or
hereafter
as
to
all
the
metaphysics
of
your
good
doctor
you
can
t
tell
how
they
tire
me
i
m
not
the
sort
of
person
that
they
can
touch
i
must
have
real
things
people
abstractions
are
nothing
to
me
then
i
think
that
he
systematically
contradicts
on
one
sunday
what
he
preaches
on
another
one
sunday
he
tells
us
that
god
is
the
immediate
efficient
author
of
every
act
of
will
the
next
he
tells
us
that
we
are
entire
free
agents
i
see
no
sense
in
it
and
can
t
take
the
trouble
to
put
it
together
but
then
he
and
you
have
something
in
you
that
i
call
religion
that
makes
you
when
i
see
a
man
working
away
on
an
entirely
honest
unworldly
disinterested
pattern
as
he
does
and
when
i
see
you
mary
as
i
said
before
i
should
like
at
least
to
as
you
are
whether
i
could
believe
as
you
do
or
not
how
could
you
so
care
for
me
and
waste
on
one
so
unworthy
of
you
such
love
oh
mary
some
better
man
must
win
you
i
never
shall
and
never
can
then
you
must
not
quite
forget
me
you
must
be
my
friend
my
saint
if
through
your
prayers
your
bible
your
friendship
you
can
bring
me
to
your
state
i
am
willing
to
be
brought
there
desirous
god
has
put
the
key
of
my
soul
into
your
hands
so
dear
mary
pray
still
for
your
naughty
loving
cousin
mary
read
this
letter
and
it
with
more
pain
than
pleasure
to
feel
the
immortality
of
a
beloved
soul
hanging
upon
us
to
feel
that
its
only
communications
with
heaven
must
be
through
us
is
the
most
solemn
and
touching
thought
that
can
pervade
a
mind
it
was
without
one
particle
of
gratified
vanity
with
even
a
throb
of
pain
that
she
read
such
exalted
praises
of
herself
from
one
blind
to
the
glories
of
a
far
higher
loveliness
yet
was
she
at
that
moment
unknown
to
herself
one
of
the
great
company
scattered
through
earth
who
are
priests
unto
god
between
the
divine
one
who
has
unveiled
himself
unto
them
and
those
who
as
yet
stand
in
the
outer
courts
of
the
great
sanctuary
of
truth
and
holiness
many
a
heart
wrung
pierced
bleeding
with
the
sins
and
sorrows
of
earth
longing
to
depart
stands
in
this
mournful
and
beautiful
ministry
but
stands
unconscious
of
the
glory
of
the
work
in
which
it
waits
and
suffers
god
s
kings
and
priests
are
crowned
with
thorns
walking
the
earth
with
bleeding
feet
and
comprehending
not
the
work
they
are
performing
mary
took
from
a
drawer
a
small
from
which
dropped
a
lock
of
black
hair
glossy
curl
which
seemed
to
have
a
sort
of
wicked
wilful
life
in
every
shining
ring
just
as
she
had
often
seen
it
shake
naughtily
on
the
owner
s
head
she
felt
a
strange
tenderness
towards
the
little
wilful
thing
and
as
she
leaned
over
it
made
in
her
heart
a
thousand
fond
apologies
for
every
fault
and
error
she
was
standing
thus
when
scudder
entered
the
room
to
see
if
her
daughter
had
yet
retired
what
are
you
doing
there
mary
she
said
as
her
eye
fell
on
the
letter
what
is
it
you
are
reading
mary
felt
herself
grow
pale
it
was
the
first
time
in
her
whole
life
that
her
mother
had
asked
her
a
question
that
she
was
not
from
the
heart
ready
to
answer
her
loyalty
to
her
only
parent
had
gone
on
with
that
she
gave
to
her
god
she
felt
somehow
that
the
revelations
of
that
afternoon
had
opened
a
gulf
between
them
and
the
consciousness
overpowered
her
scudder
was
astonished
at
her
evident
embarrassment
her
trembling
and
paleness
she
was
a
woman
of
prompt
imperative
temperament
and
the
slightest
hesitation
in
rendering
to
her
a
full
outspoken
confidence
had
never
before
occurred
in
their
intercourse
her
child
was
the
core
of
her
heart
the
apple
of
her
eye
and
intense
love
is
always
near
neighbour
to
anger
there
was
therefore
an
involuntary
flash
from
her
eye
and
a
heightening
of
her
colour
as
she
said
mary
are
you
concealing
anything
from
your
mother
in
that
moment
mary
had
grown
calm
again
the
wonted
serene
balanced
nature
had
found
its
habitual
poise
and
she
looked
up
innocently
though
with
tears
in
her
large
blue
eyes
and
said
no
mother
have
nothing
that
i
do
not
mean
to
tell
you
fully
this
letter
came
from
james
marvyn
he
came
here
to
see
me
this
here
i
did
not
see
after
dinner
i
was
sitting
here
in
the
window
and
suddenly
he
came
up
behind
me
through
the
katy
sat
down
with
a
flushed
cheek
and
a
discomposed
air
but
mary
seemed
actually
to
bear
her
down
by
the
candid
clearness
of
the
large
blue
eye
which
she
turned
on
her
as
she
stood
perfectly
collected
with
her
face
and
a
brilliant
spot
burning
on
each
cheek
james
came
to
say
he
complained
that
he
had
not
had
a
chance
to
see
me
alone
since
he
came
and
what
should
he
want
to
see
you
alone
for
said
scudder
in
a
dry
disturbed
tone
mother
has
things
at
times
which
they
would
like
to
say
to
some
one
person
alone
said
mary
well
tell
me
what
he
i
will
try
in
the
first
place
he
said
that
he
always
had
been
free
all
his
life
to
run
in
and
out
of
our
house
and
to
wait
on
me
like
a
hum
said
scudder
but
he
isn
t
your
brother
for
all
well
then
he
wanted
to
know
why
you
were
so
cold
to
him
and
why
you
never
let
him
walk
with
me
from
meetings
or
see
me
alone
as
we
often
used
to
and
i
told
him
why
we
were
not
children
now
and
that
you
thought
it
was
not
best
and
then
i
talked
with
him
about
religion
and
tried
to
persuade
him
to
attend
to
the
concerns
of
his
soul
and
i
never
felt
so
much
hope
for
him
as
i
do
aunt
katy
looked
sceptical
and
remarked
if
he
really
felt
a
disposition
for
religious
instruction
could
guide
him
much
better
than
you
yes
i
told
him
and
i
tried
to
persuade
him
to
talk
with
but
he
was
very
unwilling
he
said
i
could
have
more
influence
over
him
than
anybody
else
nobody
could
do
him
any
good
but
yes
yes
understand
all
that
said
aunt
katy
i
have
heard
young
men
say
before
and
i
know
just
what
it
amounts
but
mother
i
do
think
james
was
moved
very
much
this
afternoon
i
never
heard
him
speak
so
seriously
he
seemed
really
in
earnest
and
he
asked
me
to
give
him
my
couldn
t
he
read
any
bible
but
yours
why
naturally
you
know
mother
he
would
like
my
bible
better
because
it
would
put
him
in
mind
of
me
he
promised
faithfully
to
read
it
all
and
then
it
seems
he
wrote
you
a
yes
mary
shrank
from
showing
this
letter
from
the
natural
sense
of
honour
which
makes
us
feel
it
indelicate
to
expose
to
an
unsympathising
eye
the
confidential
outpourings
of
another
heart
and
then
she
felt
quite
sure
that
there
was
no
such
intercessor
for
james
in
her
mother
s
heart
as
in
her
own
but
over
all
this
reluctance
rose
the
determined
force
of
duty
and
she
handed
the
letter
in
silence
to
her
mother
scudder
took
it
laid
it
deliberately
in
her
lap
and
then
began
searching
in
the
pocket
of
her
chintz
petticoat
for
her
spectacles
these
being
found
she
wiped
them
accurately
adjusted
them
opened
the
letter
and
spread
it
on
her
lap
brushing
out
its
folds
and
straightening
it
that
she
might
read
with
the
greater
ease
after
this
she
read
it
carefully
and
deliberately
and
all
this
while
there
was
such
a
stillness
that
the
sound
of
the
tall
varnished
clock
in
the
best
room
could
be
heard
through
the
door
after
reading
it
with
the
most
tiresome
torturing
slowness
she
rose
and
laying
it
on
the
table
under
mary
s
eye
and
pressing
down
her
finger
on
two
lines
in
the
letter
said
mary
have
you
told
james
that
you
loved
him
yes
mother
always
i
always
loved
him
and
he
always
knew
but
mary
this
that
he
speaks
of
is
something
different
what
has
passed
why
mother
he
was
saying
that
we
who
were
christians
drew
to
ourselves
and
did
not
care
for
the
salvation
of
our
friends
and
then
i
told
him
how
i
had
always
prayed
for
him
and
how
i
should
be
willing
even
to
give
up
my
hopes
in
heaven
if
he
might
be
child
do
you
mean
i
mean
if
only
one
of
us
two
could
go
to
heaven
i
had
rather
it
should
be
him
than
me
said
mary
oh
child
child
said
scudder
with
a
sort
of
groan
has
it
gone
with
you
so
far
as
this
poor
child
all
my
care
you
in
love
with
this
boy
heart
is
set
on
mother
i
am
not
i
never
expect
to
see
him
much
expect
to
marry
him
or
anybody
else
he
seems
to
me
to
have
so
much
more
life
and
soul
and
spirit
than
most
people
think
him
so
noble
and
grand
is
that
he
be
if
he
were
all
he
ought
to
be
somehow
i
never
think
of
myself
in
thinking
of
him
and
his
salvation
seems
worth
more
than
mine
can
do
so
much
more
can
live
such
splendid
lives
a
real
noble
man
is
so
glorious
and
you
would
like
to
see
him
well
married
would
you
not
said
scudder
sending
with
a
true
woman
s
aim
this
keen
arrow
into
the
midst
of
the
cloud
of
enthusiasm
which
enveloped
her
daughter
i
think
she
added
that
jane
spencer
would
make
him
an
excellent
mary
was
astonished
at
a
strange
new
pain
that
shot
through
her
at
these
words
she
drew
in
her
breath
and
turned
herself
uneasily
as
one
who
had
literally
felt
a
keen
dividing
blade
piercing
between
soul
and
spirit
till
this
moment
she
had
never
been
conscious
of
herself
but
the
shaft
had
torn
the
veil
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
the
hot
blood
flushed
scarlet
over
neck
and
brow
at
last
with
a
beseeching
look
she
threw
herself
into
her
mother
s
arms
oh
mother
mother
i
am
selfish
after
all
scudder
folded
her
silently
to
her
heart
and
said
my
daughter
that
is
not
at
all
what
i
wished
it
to
be
i
see
how
it
is
then
you
have
been
a
good
child
i
don
t
blame
you
we
can
t
always
help
ourselves
we
don
t
always
really
know
how
we
do
feel
i
didn
t
know
for
a
long
while
that
i
loved
your
father
i
thought
i
was
only
curious
about
him
because
he
had
a
strange
way
of
treating
me
different
from
other
men
but
one
day
i
remember
julian
simons
told
me
that
it
was
reported
that
his
mother
was
making
a
match
for
him
with
susan
emery
and
i
was
astonished
to
find
how
i
felt
i
saw
him
that
evening
and
the
moment
he
looked
at
me
i
saw
it
wasn
t
true
all
at
once
i
knew
something
i
never
knew
before
that
was
that
i
should
be
very
unhappy
if
he
loved
any
one
else
better
than
me
but
then
my
child
your
father
was
a
different
man
from
james
was
as
much
better
than
i
was
as
you
are
than
james
i
was
a
foolish
thoughtless
young
thing
then
i
never
should
have
been
anything
at
all
but
for
him
somehow
when
i
loved
him
i
grew
more
serious
and
then
he
always
guided
and
led
me
mary
your
father
was
a
wonderful
man
he
was
one
of
the
sort
that
the
world
knows
not
of
sometime
i
must
show
you
his
letters
i
always
hoped
my
daughter
that
you
would
marry
such
a
don
t
speak
of
marrying
mother
i
never
shall
you
certainly
should
not
unless
you
can
marry
in
the
lord
remember
the
words
be
ye
not
unequally
yoked
together
with
unbelievers
for
what
fellowship
hath
righteousness
with
unrighteousness
and
what
communion
hath
light
with
darkness
and
what
concord
hath
christ
with
belial
or
what
part
hath
he
that
believeth
with
an
infidel
mother
james
is
not
an
he
certainly
is
an
mary
by
his
own
confession
but
then
god
is
a
sovereign
and
hath
mercy
on
whom
he
will
you
do
right
to
pray
for
him
but
if
he
does
not
come
out
on
the
lord
s
side
you
must
not
let
your
heart
mislead
you
he
is
going
to
be
gone
three
years
and
you
must
try
to
think
as
little
of
him
as
possible
your
mind
upon
your
duties
like
a
good
girl
and
god
will
bless
you
don
t
believe
too
much
in
your
power
over
him
men
when
they
are
in
love
will
promise
anything
and
really
think
they
mean
it
but
nothing
is
a
saving
change
except
what
is
wrought
in
them
by
sovereign
but
mother
does
not
god
use
the
love
we
have
to
each
other
as
a
means
of
doing
us
good
did
you
not
say
that
it
was
by
your
love
to
father
that
you
first
were
led
to
think
seriously
that
is
true
my
child
said
scudder
who
like
many
of
the
rest
of
the
world
was
surprised
to
meet
her
own
words
walking
out
on
a
track
where
she
had
not
expected
them
but
was
yet
too
true
of
soul
to
cut
their
acquaintance
because
they
were
not
going
the
way
of
her
wishes
yes
all
that
is
true
but
yet
mary
when
one
has
but
one
little
ewe
lamb
in
the
world
one
is
jealous
of
it
i
would
give
all
the
world
if
you
had
never
seen
james
it
is
dreadful
enough
for
a
woman
to
love
anybody
as
you
can
but
it
is
more
to
love
a
man
of
unsettled
character
and
no
religion
but
then
the
lord
appoints
all
our
goings
it
is
not
in
man
that
walketh
to
direct
his
steps
leave
you
my
child
in
his
and
with
one
solemn
and
long
embrace
the
mother
and
daughter
parted
for
the
night
it
is
impossible
to
write
a
story
of
new
england
life
and
manners
for
a
thoughtless
person
if
we
represent
things
as
they
are
their
intensity
their
depth
their
unworldly
gravity
and
earnestness
must
inevitably
repel
lighter
spirits
as
the
reverse
pole
of
the
magnet
drives
off
sticks
and
straws
in
no
other
country
were
the
soul
and
the
spiritual
life
ever
such
intense
realities
and
everything
contemplated
so
much
to
use
a
current
phrase
in
reference
to
scudder
was
a
strong
practical
woman
no
one
had
a
clearer
estimate
of
the
material
and
outward
life
or
could
more
minutely
manage
its
smallest
item
but
then
a
tremendous
eternal
future
had
so
weighed
down
and
compacted
the
fibres
of
her
very
soul
that
all
earthly
things
were
but
as
dust
in
comparison
to
it
that
her
child
should
be
one
elected
to
walk
in
white
to
reign
with
christ
when
earth
was
a
forgotten
dream
was
her
one
absorbing
wish
and
she
looked
on
all
the
events
of
life
only
with
reference
to
this
the
way
of
life
was
narrow
the
chances
in
favour
of
any
child
of
adam
infinitely
small
the
best
the
most
seemingly
pure
and
fair
was
by
nature
a
child
of
wrath
and
could
be
saved
only
by
a
sovereign
decree
by
which
it
should
be
plucked
as
a
brand
from
the
burning
therefore
it
was
that
weighing
all
things
in
one
balance
there
was
the
sincerity
of
her
whole
being
in
the
dread
which
she
felt
at
the
thought
of
her
daughter
s
marriage
with
an
unbeliever
scudder
after
retiring
to
her
room
took
her
bible
in
preparation
for
her
habitual
nightly
exercise
of
devotion
before
going
to
rest
she
read
and
a
chapter
scarce
thinking
what
she
was
reading
herself
then
sat
with
the
book
in
her
hand
in
deep
thought
james
marvyn
was
her
cousin
s
son
and
she
had
a
strong
feeling
of
respect
and
family
attachment
for
his
father
she
had
too
a
real
kindness
for
the
young
man
whom
she
regarded
as
a
wilful
youngster
but
that
should
touch
her
saint
her
mary
that
should
take
from
her
the
daughter
who
was
her
all
really
embittered
her
heart
towards
him
after
all
she
said
to
herself
there
are
three
years
years
in
which
there
will
be
no
letters
or
perhaps
only
one
or
two
a
great
deal
may
be
done
in
three
years
if
one
is
wise
she
felt
within
herself
an
arousing
of
all
the
shrewd
womanly
and
motherly
tact
of
her
nature
to
meet
this
new
emergency
chapter
vi
the
doctor
it
is
seldom
that
man
and
woman
come
together
in
intimate
association
unless
influences
are
at
work
more
subtle
and
mysterious
than
the
subjects
of
them
dream
even
in
cases
where
the
strongest
ruling
force
of
the
two
sexes
seems
out
of
the
question
there
is
still
something
peculiar
and
insidious
in
their
relationship
a
fatherly
old
gentleman
who
undertakes
the
care
of
a
sprightly
young
girl
finds
to
his
astonishment
that
little
miss
spins
all
sorts
of
cobwebs
round
him
grave
professors
and
teachers
can
not
give
lessons
to
their
female
pupils
just
as
they
give
them
to
the
coarser
sex
and
more
than
once
has
the
fable
of
cadenus
and
vanessa
been
acted
over
by
the
most
unlikely
performers
the
doctor
was
a
philosopher
a
metaphysician
a
philanthropist
and
in
the
highest
and
most
earnest
sense
a
minister
of
good
on
earth
the
new
england
clergy
had
no
sentimental
affectation
of
sanctity
that
segregated
them
from
wholesome
human
relations
and
consequently
our
good
doctor
had
always
resolved
in
a
grave
and
thoughtful
spirit
at
a
suitable
time
in
his
worldly
affairs
to
choose
unto
himself
a
helpmeet
love
as
treated
of
in
romances
he
held
to
be
a
foolish
and
profane
matter
unworthy
the
attention
of
a
serious
and
reasonable
creature
all
the
language
of
poetry
on
this
subject
was
to
him
an
unknown
tongue
he
contemplated
the
entrance
on
married
life
somewhat
in
this
wise
at
a
time
and
place
suiting
he
should
look
out
unto
himself
a
woman
of
a
pleasant
countenance
and
of
good
repute
a
zealous
earnest
christian
and
well
skilled
in
the
items
of
household
management
whom
accosting
as
a
stranger
and
pilgrim
to
a
better
life
he
should
loyally
and
lovingly
entreat
as
isaac
did
rebekah
to
come
under
the
shadow
of
his
tent
and
be
a
helpmeet
unto
him
in
what
yet
remained
of
this
mortal
journey
but
straitened
circumstances
and
the
unsettled
times
of
the
revolution
in
which
he
had
taken
an
earnest
and
zealous
part
had
delayed
to
a
late
bachelorhood
the
fulfilment
of
this
resolution
when
once
received
under
the
shadow
of
scudder
s
roof
and
within
the
provident
sphere
of
her
unfailing
housekeeping
all
material
necessity
for
an
immediate
choice
was
taken
away
for
he
was
in
exactly
that
situation
dearest
to
every
scholarly
and
thoughtful
man
in
which
all
that
pertained
to
the
outward
life
appeared
to
rise
under
his
hand
at
the
moment
he
wished
for
it
without
his
knowing
how
or
why
he
was
not
at
the
head
of
a
prosperous
church
and
society
rich
and
in
the
world
as
the
pioneer
leader
of
a
new
theology
in
a
country
where
theology
was
the
interest
he
had
to
breast
the
reaction
that
ever
attends
the
advent
of
new
ideas
his
pulpit
talents
too
were
unattractive
his
early
training
had
been
all
logical
not
in
the
least
æsthetic
for
like
the
ministry
of
his
country
generally
he
had
been
trained
always
to
think
more
of
what
he
should
say
than
of
how
he
should
say
it
consequently
his
style
though
not
without
a
certain
massive
greatness
which
always
comes
from
largeness
of
nature
had
none
of
those
attractions
by
which
the
common
masses
are
beguiled
into
thinking
he
gave
only
the
results
of
thought
not
its
incipient
processes
and
the
consequence
was
that
few
could
follow
him
in
like
manner
his
religious
teachings
were
characterized
by
an
ideality
so
high
as
quite
to
discourage
ordinary
virtue
there
is
a
ladder
to
heaven
whose
base
god
has
placed
in
human
affections
tender
instincts
symbolic
feelings
sacraments
of
love
through
which
the
soul
rises
higher
and
higher
refining
as
she
goes
till
she
outgrows
the
human
and
changes
as
she
rises
into
the
image
of
the
divine
at
the
very
top
of
this
ladder
at
the
threshold
of
paradise
blazes
dazzling
and
crystalline
that
celestial
grade
where
the
soul
knows
self
no
more
having
learned
through
a
long
experience
of
devotion
how
blest
it
is
to
lose
herself
in
that
eternal
love
and
beauty
of
which
all
earthly
fairness
and
grandeur
are
but
the
dim
type
the
distant
shadow
this
highest
step
this
saintly
elevation
which
but
few
selectest
spirits
ever
on
earth
attain
to
raise
the
soul
to
which
the
eternal
father
organized
every
relation
of
human
existence
and
strung
every
chord
of
human
love
for
which
this
world
is
one
long
discipline
for
which
the
soul
s
human
education
is
constantly
varied
for
which
it
is
now
torn
by
sorrow
now
flooded
by
joy
to
which
all
its
multiplied
powers
tend
with
upward
hands
of
dumb
and
ignorant
aspiration
ultima
thule
of
virtue
had
been
seized
upon
by
our
sage
as
the
of
religion
he
knocked
out
every
round
of
the
ladder
but
the
highest
and
then
pointing
to
its
hopeless
splendour
said
to
the
world
go
up
thither
and
be
saved
short
of
that
absolute
that
unconditional
surrender
to
the
infinite
there
was
nothing
meritorious
if
were
commanded
every
moment
of
refusal
was
rebellion
every
prayer
not
based
on
such
consecration
he
held
to
be
an
insult
to
the
divine
majesty
reading
of
the
word
the
conscientious
conduct
of
life
the
performance
of
the
duties
of
man
to
man
being
without
this
the
deeds
of
a
creature
in
conscious
rebellion
to
its
eternal
sovereign
were
all
vitiated
and
made
void
nothing
was
to
be
preached
to
the
sinner
but
his
ability
and
obligation
to
rise
immediately
to
this
height
it
is
not
wonderful
that
teaching
of
this
sort
should
seem
to
many
unendurable
and
that
the
multitude
should
desert
the
preacher
with
the
cry
this
is
an
hard
saying
who
can
hear
it
the
young
and
gay
were
wearied
by
the
dryness
of
metaphysical
discussions
which
to
them
were
as
unintelligible
as
a
statement
of
the
last
results
of
the
mathematician
to
the
child
commencing
the
there
remained
around
him
only
a
select
circle
hard
thinkers
who
delighted
in
metaphysical
subtleties
devoted
natures
who
sympathized
with
the
unworldly
purity
of
his
life
his
active
philanthropy
and
untiring
benevolence
men
who
admired
his
independence
of
thought
and
freedom
in
breasting
received
opinions
those
unperceiving
dull
good
people
who
are
content
to
go
to
church
anywhere
as
convenience
and
circumstances
may
drift
them
who
serve
among
the
and
thinking
portion
of
the
world
much
the
same
purpose
as
adipose
matter
in
the
human
system
as
a
soft
cushion
between
the
nerves
of
feeling
and
the
muscles
of
activity
there
was
something
affecting
in
the
pertinacity
with
which
the
good
doctor
persevered
in
saying
his
say
to
his
discouraging
minority
of
hearers
his
salary
was
small
his
damaged
during
the
revolutionary
struggle
was
dilapidated
and
forlorn
in
winter
and
in
summer
admitting
a
flood
of
sun
and
dust
through
those
great
windows
which
formed
so
principal
a
feature
in
those
first
efforts
of
puritan
architecture
still
grand
in
his
humility
he
preached
on
as
a
soldier
never
asks
why
but
stands
at
apparently
the
most
useless
post
so
he
went
on
from
sunday
to
sunday
comforting
himself
with
the
reflection
that
no
one
could
think
more
meanly
of
his
ministrations
than
he
did
himself
i
am
like
moses
only
in
not
being
eloquent
he
said
in
his
simplicity
my
preaching
is
barren
and
dull
my
voice
is
hard
and
harsh
but
then
the
lord
is
a
sovereign
and
may
work
through
me
he
fed
elijah
once
through
a
raven
and
he
may
feed
some
poor
wandering
soul
through
the
only
mistake
made
by
the
good
man
was
that
of
supposing
that
the
elaboration
of
theology
was
preaching
the
gospel
the
gospel
he
was
preaching
constantly
by
his
pure
unworldly
living
by
his
visitations
to
homes
of
poverty
and
sorrow
by
his
searching
out
of
the
lowly
african
slaves
his
teaching
of
those
whom
no
one
else
in
those
days
had
thought
of
teaching
and
by
the
grand
humanity
outrunning
his
age
in
which
he
protested
against
the
then
admitted
system
of
slavery
and
the
but
when
rising
in
the
pulpit
he
followed
trains
of
thought
suited
only
to
the
desk
of
the
theological
he
did
it
blindly
following
that
law
of
by
which
minds
of
a
certain
amount
of
fervour
utter
what
is
in
them
whether
men
will
hear
or
whether
they
will
forbear
but
the
place
where
our
doctor
was
happiest
was
his
study
there
he
explored
and
wandered
and
read
and
thought
and
lived
a
life
as
wholly
ideal
and
intellectual
as
heart
could
conceive
and
could
enter
a
reverend
doctor
s
study
and
find
his
way
into
a
heart
empty
and
swept
of
all
those
shreds
of
poetry
and
romance
in
which
he
usually
finds
the
material
of
his
incantations
even
so
he
came
so
thoughtfully
so
reverently
with
so
wise
and
cautious
a
footfall
that
the
good
doctor
never
even
raised
his
spectacles
to
see
who
was
there
the
first
that
he
knew
poor
man
he
was
breathing
an
air
of
strange
and
subtile
sweetness
what
paradise
he
never
stopped
his
studies
to
inquire
he
was
like
a
great
rugged
elm
with
all
its
lacings
and
archings
of
boughs
and
twigs
which
has
stood
cold
and
frozen
against
the
metallic
blue
of
winter
sky
forgetful
of
leaves
and
patient
in
its
bareness
calmly
content
in
its
naked
strength
and
crystalline
definiteness
of
outline
but
in
april
there
is
a
rising
and
stirring
within
the
grand
old
monster
whispering
of
knotted
buds
a
mounting
of
sap
coursing
ethereally
from
bough
to
bough
with
a
warm
and
gentle
life
and
though
the
old
elm
knows
it
not
a
new
creation
is
at
hand
just
so
ever
since
the
good
man
had
lived
at
scudder
s
and
had
the
gentle
mary
for
his
catechumen
a
richer
life
seemed
to
have
coloured
his
thoughts
mind
seemed
to
work
with
a
pleasure
never
felt
before
whoever
looked
on
the
forehead
of
the
good
doctor
must
have
seen
the
squareness
of
ideality
giving
marked
effect
to
its
outline
as
yet
ideality
had
dealt
only
with
the
intellectual
and
invisible
leading
to
subtile
refinements
of
argument
and
exalted
ideas
of
morals
but
there
was
lying
in
him
crude
and
unworked
a
whole
mine
of
those
artistic
feelings
and
perceptions
which
are
awakened
and
developed
only
by
the
touch
of
beauty
had
he
been
born
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
great
duomo
of
florence
where
giotto
s
campanile
rises
like
the
slender
stalk
of
a
celestial
lily
where
varied
marbles
and
rainbow
glass
and
gorgeous
paintings
and
lofty
statuary
call
forth
even
from
childhood
the
soul
s
reminiscences
of
the
bygone
glories
of
its
pristine
state
his
would
have
been
a
soul
as
rounded
and
full
in
its
sphere
of
faculties
as
that
of
da
vinci
or
michael
angelo
but
of
all
that
he
was
as
ignorant
as
a
child
and
the
first
revelation
of
his
dormant
nature
was
to
come
to
him
through
the
face
of
woman
work
of
the
mighty
master
which
is
to
be
found
in
all
lands
and
ages
what
makes
the
love
of
a
great
mind
something
fearful
in
its
inception
is
that
it
is
often
the
unsealing
of
a
hitherto
undeveloped
portion
of
a
large
and
powerful
being
the
woman
may
or
may
not
seem
to
other
eyes
adequate
to
the
effect
produced
but
the
man
can
not
forget
her
because
with
her
came
a
change
which
makes
him
for
ever
a
different
being
so
it
was
with
our
friend
a
woman
it
was
that
was
destined
to
awaken
in
him
all
that
consciousness
which
music
painting
poetry
awaken
in
more
minds
and
it
is
the
silent
breathing
of
her
creative
presence
that
is
even
now
creating
him
anew
while
as
yet
he
knows
it
not
he
never
thought
this
good
old
soul
whether
mary
were
beautiful
or
not
he
never
even
knew
that
he
looked
at
her
nor
did
he
know
why
it
was
that
the
truths
of
his
theology
when
uttered
by
her
tongue
had
such
a
wondrous
beauty
as
he
never
felt
before
he
did
not
know
why
it
was
that
when
she
silently
sat
by
him
copying
tangled
manuscript
for
the
press
as
she
sometimes
did
his
whole
study
seemed
so
full
of
some
divine
influence
as
if
like
dorothea
she
had
worn
in
her
bosom
invisibly
the
celestial
roses
of
paradise
he
recorded
honestly
in
his
diary
what
marvellous
freshness
of
spirit
the
lord
had
given
him
and
how
he
seemed
to
be
uplifted
in
his
communings
with
heaven
without
once
thinking
from
the
robes
of
what
angel
this
sweetness
had
exhaled
on
sundays
when
he
saw
good
jones
asleep
and
simon
brown
s
hard
sharp
eyes
and
deacon
twitchel
mournfully
rocking
to
and
fro
and
his
wife
handing
fennel
to
keep
the
children
awake
his
eye
glanced
across
to
the
front
gallery
where
one
earnest
young
face
ever
kindling
with
feeling
and
bright
with
intellect
followed
on
his
way
and
he
felt
uplifted
and
comforted
on
sunday
mornings
when
mary
came
out
of
her
little
room
in
clean
white
dress
with
her
and
in
her
hands
her
deep
eyes
solemn
from
recent
prayer
he
thought
of
that
fair
and
mystical
bride
the
lamb
s
wife
whose
union
with
her
divine
redeemer
in
a
future
millenial
age
was
a
frequent
and
favourite
subject
of
his
musings
yet
he
knew
not
that
this
celestial
bride
clothed
in
fine
linen
clean
and
white
veiled
in
humility
and
meekness
bore
in
his
mind
those
earthly
features
no
he
never
had
dreamed
of
that
but
only
after
she
had
passed
by
that
mystical
vision
seemed
to
him
more
radiant
more
easy
to
be
conceived
it
is
said
that
if
a
be
planted
in
the
neighbourhood
of
a
well
its
roots
running
silently
under
ground
wreathe
themselves
in
a
network
around
the
cold
clear
waters
and
the
vine
s
putting
on
outward
greenness
and
unwonted
clusters
and
fruit
is
all
that
tells
where
every
root
and
fibre
of
its
being
has
been
silently
stealing
so
those
loves
are
most
fatal
most
absorbing
in
which
with
unheeded
quietness
every
thought
and
fibre
of
our
life
twines
gradually
around
some
human
soul
to
us
the
unsuspected
of
our
being
fearful
it
is
because
so
often
the
vine
must
be
uprooted
and
all
its
fibres
wrenched
away
but
till
the
hour
of
discovery
comes
how
is
it
transfigured
by
a
new
and
beautiful
life
there
is
nothing
in
life
more
beautiful
than
that
trancelike
quiet
dawn
which
precedes
the
rising
of
love
in
the
soul
when
the
whole
being
is
pervaded
imperceptibly
and
tranquilly
by
another
being
and
we
are
happy
we
know
not
and
ask
not
why
the
soul
is
then
receiving
all
and
asking
nothing
at
a
later
day
she
becomes
and
then
come
craving
exactions
endless
questions
whole
world
of
the
material
comes
in
with
its
hard
counsels
and
consultations
and
the
beautiful
trance
fades
for
ever
of
course
all
this
is
not
so
to
my
good
friends
who
read
it
without
the
most
distant
idea
what
it
can
mean
but
there
are
people
in
the
world
to
whom
it
has
meant
and
will
mean
much
and
who
will
see
in
the
present
happiness
of
our
respectable
friend
something
even
ominous
and
sorrowful
it
had
not
escaped
the
keen
eye
of
the
mother
how
quickly
and
innocently
the
good
doctor
was
absorbed
by
her
daughter
and
thereupon
had
come
long
trains
of
practical
reflections
the
doctor
though
not
popular
indeed
as
a
preacher
was
a
noted
man
in
his
age
her
deceased
husband
had
regarded
him
with
something
of
the
same
veneration
which
might
have
been
accorded
to
a
divine
messenger
and
scudder
had
received
and
kept
this
veneration
as
a
precious
legacy
then
although
not
handsome
the
doctor
had
decidedly
a
grand
and
imposing
appearance
there
was
nothing
common
or
insignificant
about
him
indeed
it
had
been
said
that
when
just
after
the
declaration
of
peace
he
walked
through
the
town
in
the
commemorative
procession
side
by
side
with
general
washington
the
minister
in
the
majesty
of
his
gown
bands
cocked
hat
and
full
flowing
wig
was
thought
by
many
to
be
the
more
majestic
and
personable
figure
of
the
two
in
those
days
the
minister
united
in
himself
all
those
ideas
of
superior
position
and
cultivation
with
which
the
theocratic
system
of
the
new
england
community
had
invested
him
scudder
s
notions
of
social
rank
could
reach
no
higher
than
to
place
her
daughter
on
the
throne
of
such
her
mary
she
pondered
was
no
common
girl
in
those
days
it
was
a
rare
thing
for
young
persons
to
devote
themselves
to
religion
or
make
any
professions
of
devout
life
the
church
or
that
body
of
people
who
professed
to
have
passed
through
a
divine
regeneration
was
almost
entirely
confined
to
and
elderly
people
and
it
was
looked
upon
as
a
singular
and
unwonted
call
of
divine
grace
when
young
persons
came
forward
to
attach
themselves
to
it
when
mary
therefore
at
quite
an
early
age
in
all
the
bloom
of
her
youthful
beauty
arose
according
to
the
simple
and
impressive
new
england
rite
to
consecrate
herself
publicly
to
a
religious
life
and
to
join
the
company
of
professing
christians
she
was
regarded
with
a
species
of
deference
amounting
even
to
awe
had
it
not
been
for
the
childlike
unconscious
simplicity
of
her
manners
the
young
people
of
her
age
would
have
shrunk
away
from
her
as
from
one
entirely
out
of
their
line
of
thought
and
feeling
but
a
certain
natural
and
innocent
playfulness
and
amiable
made
her
a
general
favourite
nevertheless
scudder
knew
no
young
man
whom
she
deemed
worthy
to
have
and
hold
a
heart
which
she
prized
so
highly
as
to
james
he
stood
at
double
disadvantage
because
as
her
cousin
s
son
he
had
grown
up
from
childhood
under
her
eye
and
all
those
sins
and
iniquities
into
which
gay
and
adventurous
youngsters
will
be
falling
had
come
to
her
knowledge
she
felt
kindly
to
the
youth
she
wished
him
well
but
as
to
giving
him
her
mary
very
suggestion
made
her
dislike
him
she
was
quite
sure
he
must
have
tried
to
beguile
must
have
tampered
with
her
feelings
to
arouse
in
her
pure
and
mind
so
much
emotion
and
devotedness
as
she
had
witnessed
how
encouraging
a
providence
then
was
it
that
he
was
gone
to
sea
for
three
years
fortunate
that
mary
had
been
prevented
in
any
way
from
committing
herself
with
him
encouraging
that
the
only
man
in
those
parts
in
the
least
fitted
to
appreciate
her
seemed
so
greatly
pleased
and
absorbed
in
her
society
easily
might
mary
s
dutiful
reverence
be
changed
to
a
warmer
sentiment
when
she
should
find
that
so
great
a
man
could
descend
from
his
lofty
thoughts
to
think
of
her
in
fact
before
scudder
had
gone
to
sleep
the
first
night
after
james
s
departure
she
had
settled
upon
the
house
where
the
minister
and
his
young
wife
were
to
live
had
reviewed
the
and
for
each
room
and
glanced
complacently
at
an
improved
receipt
for
which
might
be
brought
out
to
glorify
a
certain
occasion
chapter
vii
the
friends
and
relations
of
james
zebedee
marvyn
the
father
of
james
was
the
sample
of
an
individuality
so
purely
the
result
of
new
england
society
and
education
that
he
must
be
embodied
in
our
story
as
a
representative
man
of
the
times
he
owned
a
large
farm
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
newport
which
he
worked
with
his
own
hands
and
kept
under
the
most
careful
cultivation
he
was
a
man
past
the
middle
of
life
with
a
white
head
a
keen
blue
eye
and
a
face
graven
deeply
with
the
lines
of
energy
and
thought
his
was
one
of
those
minds
which
new
england
forms
among
her
farmers
as
she
forms
quartz
crystals
in
her
mountains
by
a
sort
of
gradual
influence
flowing
through
every
pore
of
her
soil
and
system
his
education
properly
so
called
had
been
merely
that
of
those
common
schools
and
academies
with
which
the
states
are
thickly
sown
and
which
are
the
springs
of
so
much
intellectual
activity
here
he
had
learned
to
think
and
to
inquire
process
which
had
not
ceased
with
his
schooldays
though
toiling
daily
with
his
sons
and
hired
man
in
all
the
minutiæ
of
a
farmer
s
life
he
kept
an
observant
eye
on
the
field
of
literature
and
there
was
not
a
new
publication
heard
of
that
he
did
not
immediately
find
means
to
add
it
to
his
yearly
increasing
stock
of
books
in
particular
was
he
a
and
careful
theologian
and
all
the
controversial
tracts
sermons
and
books
with
which
then
as
ever
since
new
england
has
abounded
not
only
lay
on
his
shelves
but
had
his
pencilled
annotations
queries
and
comments
thickly
scattered
along
their
margins
there
was
scarce
an
office
of
public
trust
which
had
not
at
one
time
or
another
been
filled
by
him
he
was
deacon
of
the
church
chairman
of
the
school
committee
justice
of
the
peace
had
been
twice
representative
in
the
state
legislature
and
was
in
permanence
a
sort
of
in
all
cases
between
neighbour
and
neighbour
among
other
acquisitions
he
had
gained
some
knowledge
of
the
general
forms
of
law
and
his
advice
was
often
asked
in
preference
to
that
of
the
regular
practitioners
his
dwelling
was
one
of
those
large
square
white
clean
and
the
respectability
of
new
england
in
those
days
rejoiced
the
windows
were
shaded
by
clumps
of
lilacs
the
deep
yard
with
its
white
fence
enclosed
a
sweep
of
clean
short
grass
and
a
few
opposite
the
house
was
a
small
blacksmith
s
shed
which
of
a
wet
day
was
sparkling
and
lively
with
bellows
and
ringing
forge
while
zebedee
and
his
sons
were
hammering
and
pounding
and
putting
in
order
anything
that
was
out
of
the
way
in
or
establishments
not
unfrequently
the
latest
scientific
work
or
the
last
tractate
of
theology
lay
open
by
his
side
the
contents
of
which
would
be
discussed
with
a
neighbour
or
two
as
they
entered
for
to
say
the
truth
many
a
neighbour
less
forehanded
and
thrifty
felt
the
benefit
of
this
arrangement
of
zebedee
and
would
drop
in
to
see
if
he
wouldn
t
just
tighten
that
rivet
or
kind
o
ease
out
that
ere
brace
or
let
a
feller
have
a
turn
with
his
bellows
or
a
stroke
or
two
on
his
anvil
all
which
the
good
man
consented
with
a
grave
obligingness
the
fact
was
that
as
nothing
in
the
establishment
of
marvyn
was
often
broken
or
lost
or
out
of
place
he
had
frequent
applications
to
lend
to
those
less
fortunate
persons
always
to
be
found
who
supply
their
own
lack
of
considerateness
from
the
abundance
of
their
neighbours
he
who
is
known
always
to
be
in
hand
and
always
obliging
in
a
neighbourhood
stands
the
chance
sometimes
of
having
nothing
for
himself
zebedee
reflected
quietly
on
this
subject
taking
it
as
he
did
all
others
into
grave
and
orderly
consideration
and
finally
provided
a
complete
set
of
tools
which
he
kept
for
the
purpose
of
lending
and
when
any
of
these
were
lent
he
told
the
next
applicant
quietly
that
the
axe
or
the
hoe
was
already
out
and
thus
he
reconciled
the
scripture
which
commanded
him
to
do
good
and
lend
with
that
law
of
order
which
was
written
in
his
nature
early
in
life
marvyn
had
married
one
of
the
handsomest
girls
of
his
acquaintance
who
had
brought
him
a
thriving
and
healthy
family
of
children
of
whom
james
was
the
youngest
marvyn
was
at
this
time
a
tall
woman
thoughtful
earnest
though
sparing
in
the
matter
of
words
in
all
her
household
arrangements
she
had
the
same
thrift
and
order
which
characterized
her
husband
but
hers
was
a
mind
of
a
finer
and
higher
stamp
than
his
in
her
bedroom
near
by
her
stood
a
table
covered
with
books
so
systematic
were
her
household
arrangements
that
she
never
any
day
missed
her
regular
hours
for
reading
one
who
should
have
looked
over
this
table
would
have
seen
there
how
eager
and
hungry
a
mind
was
hid
behind
the
silent
eyes
of
this
quiet
woman
history
biography
mathematics
volumes
of
the
encyclopædia
poetry
novels
all
alike
found
their
time
and
place
there
while
she
pursued
her
household
labours
the
busy
active
soul
within
travelled
cycles
and
cycles
of
thought
few
of
which
ever
found
expression
in
words
what
might
be
that
marvellous
music
of
the
of
which
she
read
that
it
convulsed
crowds
and
drew
groans
and
tears
from
the
most
obdurate
what
might
be
those
wondrous
pictures
of
raphael
and
leonardo
da
vinci
what
would
it
be
to
see
the
apollo
the
venus
what
was
the
charm
that
enchanted
the
old
untold
and
inconceivable
to
one
who
had
never
seen
even
the
slightest
approach
to
a
work
of
art
then
those
glaciers
of
switzerland
that
grand
unapproachable
mixture
of
beauty
and
sublimity
in
her
mountains
would
it
be
to
one
who
could
see
it
then
what
were
all
those
harmonies
of
which
she
read
fugues
symphonies
oh
could
she
once
hear
the
miserere
of
mozart
just
to
know
what
music
was
like
and
the
cathedrals
what
were
they
how
wonderful
they
must
be
with
their
forests
of
arches
as
with
painted
glass
and
the
chants
and
anthems
rolling
down
their
long
aisles
on
all
these
things
she
pondered
quietly
as
she
sat
often
on
sundays
in
the
old
staring
and
looked
at
the
uncouth
old
pulpit
and
heard
the
choir
or
singing
fuguing
tunes
but
of
all
this
she
said
nothing
sometimes
for
days
her
thoughts
would
turn
from
these
subjects
and
be
absorbed
in
mathematical
or
metaphysical
studies
i
have
been
following
that
treatise
on
optics
for
a
week
and
never
understood
it
till
she
once
said
to
her
husband
i
have
found
now
that
there
has
been
a
mistake
in
drawing
the
diagrams
i
have
corrected
it
and
now
the
demonstration
is
take
care
that
wood
is
hickory
and
it
takes
only
seven
sticks
of
that
size
to
heat
the
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
a
woman
of
this
sort
was
an
inattentive
listener
to
preaching
so
stimulating
to
the
intellect
as
that
of
no
pair
of
eyes
followed
the
web
of
his
reasonings
with
a
keener
and
more
anxious
watchfulness
than
those
sad
hazel
ones
and
as
she
was
drawn
along
the
train
of
its
inevitable
logic
a
close
observer
might
have
seen
how
the
shadows
deepened
over
them
for
while
others
listened
for
the
clearness
of
the
thought
for
the
acuteness
of
the
argument
she
listened
as
a
soul
wide
acute
repressed
whose
every
fibre
is
a
nerve
listens
to
the
problem
of
its
own
destiny
as
the
mother
of
a
family
listens
to
know
what
were
the
possibilities
the
probabilities
of
this
mysterious
existence
of
ours
to
herself
and
those
dearer
to
her
than
herself
the
consequence
of
all
her
listening
was
a
history
of
deep
inward
sadness
that
exultant
joy
or
that
entire
submission
with
which
others
seemed
to
view
the
scheme
of
the
universe
as
thus
unfolded
did
not
visit
her
mind
everything
to
her
seemed
shrouded
in
gloom
and
mystery
and
that
darkness
she
received
as
a
token
of
unregeneracy
as
a
sign
that
she
was
one
of
those
who
are
destined
by
a
mysterious
decree
never
to
receive
the
light
of
the
glorious
gospel
of
christ
hence
while
her
husband
was
a
deacon
of
the
church
she
for
years
had
sat
in
her
pew
while
the
sacramental
elements
were
distributed
a
mournful
spectator
punctilious
in
every
duty
exact
reverential
she
still
regarded
herself
as
a
child
of
wrath
an
enemy
to
god
and
an
heir
of
perdition
nor
could
she
see
any
hope
of
remedy
except
in
the
sovereign
mysterious
decree
of
an
infinite
and
unknown
power
a
mercy
for
which
she
waited
with
the
sickness
of
hope
deferred
her
children
had
grown
up
successively
around
her
intelligent
and
exemplary
her
eldest
son
was
mathematical
professor
in
one
of
the
leading
colleges
of
new
england
her
second
son
who
jointly
with
his
father
superintended
the
farm
was
a
man
of
wide
literary
culture
and
of
fine
mathematical
genius
and
not
unfrequently
on
winter
evenings
the
son
father
and
mother
worked
together
by
their
kitchen
fireside
over
the
calculations
for
the
almanac
for
the
ensuing
year
which
the
son
had
been
appointed
to
edit
everything
in
the
family
arrangements
was
marked
by
a
sober
precision
a
grave
and
quiet
there
was
little
demonstrativeness
of
affection
between
parents
and
children
brothers
and
sisters
though
great
mutual
affection
and
confidence
it
was
not
pride
nor
sternness
but
a
sort
of
habitual
shamefacedness
that
kept
far
back
in
each
soul
those
feelings
which
are
the
most
beautiful
in
their
outcome
but
after
a
while
the
habit
became
so
fixed
a
nature
that
a
caressing
or
affectionate
expression
could
not
have
passed
the
lips
of
one
to
another
without
a
painful
awkwardness
love
was
understood
once
for
all
to
be
the
basis
on
which
their
life
was
built
once
for
all
they
loved
each
other
and
after
that
the
less
said
the
better
it
had
cost
the
woman
s
heart
of
marvyn
some
pangs
in
the
earlier
part
of
her
wedlock
to
accept
of
this
for
in
place
of
those
daily
which
every
woman
desires
should
be
like
god
s
loving
kindness
new
every
morning
but
hers
too
was
a
nature
strongly
inclining
inward
and
after
a
few
tremulous
movements
the
needle
of
her
soul
settled
and
her
was
accepted
as
what
she
would
like
or
could
conceive
but
as
a
reasonable
and
good
one
life
was
a
picture
painted
in
low
cool
tones
but
in
perfect
keeping
and
though
another
and
brighter
style
might
have
pleased
better
she
did
not
quarrel
with
this
into
this
steady
decorous
circle
the
youngest
child
james
made
a
formidable
irruption
one
sometimes
sees
launched
into
a
family
circle
a
child
of
so
different
a
nature
from
all
the
rest
that
it
might
seem
as
if
like
an
aërolite
he
had
fallen
out
of
another
sphere
all
the
other
babies
of
the
marvyn
family
had
been
of
that
orderly
contented
sort
who
sleep
till
it
is
convenient
to
take
them
up
and
while
awake
suck
their
thumbs
contentedly
and
look
up
with
large
round
eyes
at
the
ceiling
when
it
is
not
convenient
for
their
elders
and
betters
that
they
should
do
anything
else
in
farther
advanced
childhood
they
had
been
quiet
and
decorous
children
who
could
be
all
dressed
and
set
up
in
chairs
like
so
many
dolls
of
a
sunday
morning
patiently
awaiting
the
stroke
of
the
to
be
carried
out
and
put
into
the
waggon
which
took
them
over
the
two
miles
road
to
church
possessed
of
such
tranquil
orderly
and
exemplary
young
offshoots
marvyn
had
been
considered
eminent
for
her
faculty
in
bringing
up
children
but
james
was
destined
to
put
faculty
and
every
other
talent
which
his
mother
possessed
to
rout
he
was
an
infant
of
moods
and
tenses
and
those
not
of
any
regular
verb
he
would
cry
of
nights
and
he
would
be
taken
up
of
mornings
and
he
would
not
suck
his
thumb
nor
a
bundle
of
tied
in
a
rag
and
dipped
in
sweet
milk
with
which
the
good
gossips
in
vain
endeavoured
to
pacify
him
he
fought
manfully
with
his
two
great
fat
fists
the
battle
of
babyhood
utterly
reversed
all
nursery
maxims
and
reigned
as
baby
over
the
whole
prostrate
household
when
old
enough
to
run
alone
his
splendid
black
eyes
and
glossy
rings
of
hair
were
seen
flashing
and
bobbing
in
every
forbidden
place
and
occupation
now
trailing
on
his
mother
s
gown
he
assisted
her
in
salting
her
butter
by
throwing
in
small
contributions
of
snuff
or
sugar
as
the
case
might
be
and
again
after
one
of
those
mysterious
periods
of
silence
which
are
of
most
ominous
significance
in
nursery
experience
he
would
rise
from
the
demolition
of
her
showing
a
face
ghastly
with
blue
streaks
and
looking
more
like
a
gnome
than
the
son
of
a
respectable
mother
there
was
not
a
pitcher
of
any
description
of
contents
left
within
reach
of
his
little
tiptoes
and
busy
fingers
that
was
not
pulled
over
upon
his
giddy
head
without
in
the
least
seeming
to
improve
its
steadiness
in
short
his
mother
remarked
that
she
was
thankful
every
night
when
she
had
fairly
gotten
him
into
bed
and
asleep
james
had
really
got
through
one
more
day
and
killed
neither
himself
nor
any
one
else
as
a
boy
the
case
was
little
better
he
did
not
take
to
study
yawned
over
books
and
cut
out
moulds
for
running
anchors
when
he
should
have
been
thinking
of
his
columns
of
words
in
four
syllables
no
mortal
knew
how
he
learned
to
read
for
he
never
seemed
to
stop
running
long
enough
to
learn
anything
and
yet
he
did
learn
and
used
the
talent
in
conning
over
travels
and
lives
of
heroes
and
naval
commanders
spite
of
father
mother
and
brother
he
seemed
to
possess
the
most
extraordinary
faculty
of
running
up
unsavoury
acquaintances
he
was
a
with
every
tom
and
jack
and
jim
and
ben
and
dick
that
strolled
on
the
wharves
and
astonished
his
father
with
minutest
particulars
of
every
ship
schooner
and
brig
in
the
harbour
together
with
biographical
notes
of
the
different
toms
dicks
and
harrys
by
whom
they
were
worked
there
was
but
one
member
of
the
family
that
seemed
to
know
at
all
what
to
make
of
james
and
that
was
their
negro
servant
candace
in
those
days
when
domestic
slavery
prevailed
in
new
england
it
was
quite
a
different
thing
in
its
aspects
from
the
same
institution
in
more
southern
latitudes
the
hard
soil
unyielding
to
any
but
the
most
considerate
culture
the
thrifty
close
shrewd
habits
of
the
people
and
their
untiring
activity
and
industry
prevented
among
the
mass
of
the
people
any
great
reliance
on
slave
labour
it
was
something
foreign
grotesque
and
picturesque
in
a
life
of
the
most
sameness
it
was
even
as
if
one
should
see
clusters
of
scattered
here
and
there
among
yankee
wooden
or
open
one
s
eyes
on
clumps
of
aloes
growing
among
hardhack
and
huckleberry
bushes
in
the
pastures
added
to
this
there
were
from
the
very
first
in
new
england
serious
doubts
in
the
minds
of
thoughtful
and
conscientious
people
in
reference
to
the
lawfulness
of
slavery
and
this
scruple
prevented
many
from
availing
themselves
of
it
and
proved
a
restraint
on
all
so
that
nothing
like
existed
and
what
servants
were
owned
were
scattered
among
different
families
of
which
they
came
to
be
regarded
and
to
regard
themselves
as
a
legitimate
part
and
portion
marvyn
as
a
man
of
substance
numbering
two
or
three
in
his
establishment
among
whom
candace
reigned
chief
the
presence
of
these
tropical
specimens
of
humanity
with
their
wide
joyous
rich
physical
abundance
of
nature
and
their
hearty
of
outward
expression
was
a
relief
to
the
still
lines
in
which
the
picture
of
new
england
life
was
drawn
which
an
artist
must
appreciate
no
race
has
ever
shown
such
infinite
and
rich
capabilities
of
adaptation
to
varying
soil
and
circumstances
as
the
negro
alike
to
them
the
snows
of
canada
the
hard
rocky
land
of
new
england
with
its
set
lines
and
orderly
ways
or
the
gorgeous
profusion
and
loose
abundance
of
the
southern
states
sambo
and
cuffy
expand
under
them
all
new
england
yet
preserves
among
her
hills
and
valleys
the
lingering
echoes
of
the
jokes
and
jollities
of
various
sable
worthies
who
saw
alike
in
orthodoxy
and
heterodoxy
in
and
only
food
for
more
abundant
merriment
fact
the
minister
of
those
days
not
unfrequently
had
his
black
shadow
a
sort
of
african
boswell
who
powdered
his
wig
brushed
his
boots
defended
and
patronized
his
sermons
and
strutted
complacently
about
as
if
through
virtue
of
his
blackness
he
had
absorbed
every
ray
of
his
master
s
dignity
and
wisdom
in
families
the
presence
of
these
exotics
was
a
godsend
to
the
children
supplying
from
the
abundant
outwardness
and
demonstrativeness
of
their
nature
that
aliment
of
sympathy
so
dear
to
childhood
which
the
repressed
and
quiet
habits
of
new
england
education
denied
many
and
many
a
new
englander
counts
among
his
pleasantest
early
recollections
the
memory
of
some
of
these
genial
creatures
who
by
their
warmth
of
nature
were
the
first
and
most
potent
mesmerizers
of
his
childish
mind

majestic
black

swinging
majesty
of
motion
like
that
of

her
shining
black
skin
and
glistening
white
teeth
were
indications
of
perfect
physical
vigour
which
had
never
known
a
day
s
sickness
her
turban
of
broad
red
and
yellow
bandanna
stripes
had
even
a
warm
tropical
glow
and
her
ample
skirts
were
always
ready
to
be
spread
over
every
childish
transgression
of
her
youngest
pet
and
favourite
james
she
used
to
hold
him
entranced
long
winter
evenings
while
she
sat
knitting
in
the
and
crooned
to
him
strange
wild
african
legends
of
the
things
that
she
had
seen
in
her
childhood
and
early
days
she
had
been
stolen
when
about
fifteen
years
of
age
and
these
weird
dreamy
talks
increased
the
fervour
of
his
roving
imagination
and
his
desire
to
explore
the
wonders
of
the
wide
and
unknown
world
when
rebuked
or
chastised
it
was
she
who
had
secret
bowels
of
mercy
for
him
and
hid
doughnuts
in
her
ample
bosom
to
be
secretly
administered
to
him
in
mitigation
of
the
sentence
that
sent
him
supperless
to
bed
and
many
a
triangle
of
pie
many
a
wedge
of
cake
had
conveyed
to
him
surreptitious
consolations
which
his
more
conscientious
mother
longed
but
dared
not
to
impart
in
fact
these
ministrations
if
suspected
were
winked
at
by
marvyn
for
two
reasons
first
that
mothers
are
generally
glad
of
any
to
an
erring
boy
which
they
are
not
responsible
for
and
second
that
candace
was
so
set
in
her
ways
and
opinions
that
one
might
as
well
come
in

of
a
ship

at

for
one
evening
james
was
missing
at
supper
missing
by
the
fireside
gone
all
night
not
at
home
to
breakfast
finally
a
strange
weird
most
who
had
often
been
forbidden
the
premises
by
marvyn
brought
in
a
letter
which
announced
that
james
had
sailed
in
the
ariel
the
evening
before
zebedee
marvyn
set
his
face
as
a
flint
and
said
he
went

from

because
he
was
not

old
candace
lifted
her
great
floury
fist
from
the
and
shaking
it
like
a

snowball
said
oh

and
candace
concluded
her
speech
by
giving
a
lift
to
her
whole
batch
of
dough
and
flinging
it
down
in
the
trough
with
an
emphasis
that
made
the
pewter
on
the
dresser
rattle
this
apparently
irreverent
way
of
expressing
her
mind
so
contrary
to
the
deferential
habits
studiously
inculcated
in
family
discipline
had
grown
to
be
so
much
a
matter
of
course
to
all
the
family
that
nobody
ever
thought
of
rebuking
it
there
was
a
sort
of
savage
freedom
about
her
which
they
excused
in
right
of
her
having
been
born
and
bred
a
heathen
and
of
course
not
to
be
expected
to
come
at
once
under
the
yoke
of
civilization
in
fact
you
must
all
have
noticed
my
dear
readers
that
there
are
some
sorts
of
people
for
whom
everybody
turns
out
as
they
would
for
a
without
stopping
to
ask
candace
was
one
of
them
moreover
marvyn
was
not
displeased
with
this
defence
of
james
as
might
be
inferred
from
his
mentioning
it
four
or
five
times
in
the
course
of
the
morning
to
say
how
foolish
it
was
why
it
was
that
candace
and
everybody
else
got
so
infatuated
with
that
boy
ending
at
last
after
a
long
period
of
thought
with
the
remark
that
these
poor
african
creatures
often
seemed
to
have
a
great
deal
of
shrewdness
in
them
and
that
he
was
often
astonished
at
the
penetration
that
candace
showed
at
the
end
of
the
year
james
came
home
more
quiet
and
manly
than
he
had
ever
been
known
before
handsome
with
his
sunburnt
face
and
his
keen
dark
eyes
and
glossy
curls
that
half
the
girls
in
the
front
gallery
lost
their
hearts
the
first
sunday
he
appeared
in
church
he
was
tender
as
a
woman
to
his
mother
and
followed
her
with
his
eyes
like
a
lover
wherever
she
went
he
made
due
and
manly
acknowledgments
to
his
father
but
declared
his
fixed
and
settled
intention
to
abide
by
the
profession
he
had
chosen
and
he
brought
home
all
sorts
of
strange
foreign
gifts
for
every
member
of
the
household
candace
was
glorified
with
a
flaming
red
and
yellow
turban
of
moorish
stuff
from
mogadore
together
with
a
pair
of
gorgeous
yellow
morocco
slippers
with
peaked
toes
which
though
there
appeared
no
call
to
wear
them
in
her
common
course
of
life
she
would
put
on
her
fat
feet
and
contemplate
with
daily
satisfaction
she
became
increasingly
strengthened
thereby
in
the
conviction
that
the
angels
who
had
their
hooks
in
massa
james
s
jacket
were
already
beginning
to
shorten
the
line
chapter
viii
which
treats
of
romance
there
is
no
word
in
the
english
language
more
unceremoniously
and
indefinitely
kicked
and
cuffed
about
by
what
are
called
sensible
people
than
the
word
when
smith
or
stubbs
has
brought
every
wheel
of
life
into
such
range
and
order
that
it
is
one
steady
daily
grind
they
themselves
have
come
into
the
habits
and
attitudes
of
the
patient
donkey
who
steps
round
and
round
the
endlessly
turning
wheel
of
some
they
fancy
that
they
have
gotten
the
victory
that
overcometh
the
all
but
this
dead
grind
and
the
dollars
that
come
through
the
mill
is
by
them
thrown
into
one
waste
and
labelled
perhaps
there
was
a
time
in
smith
s
youth
remembers
it
now
he
read
poetry
when
his
cheek
was
wet
with
strange
tears
when
a
little
song
ground
out
by
an
in
the
street
had
power
to
set
his
heart
beating
and
bring
a
mist
before
his
eyes
ah
in
those
days
he
had
a
vision
pair
of
soft
eyes
stirred
him
strangely
a
little
weak
hand
was
laid
on
his
manhood
and
it
shook
and
trembled
and
then
came
all
the
humility
the
aspiration
the
fear
the
hope
the
high
desire
the
troubling
of
the
waters
by
the
descending
angel
of
love
a
little
more
and
smith
might
have
become
a
man
instead
of
a
banker
he
thinks
of
it
now
sometimes
as
he
looks
across
the
fireplace
after
dinner
and
sees
smith
asleep
innocently
shaking
the
bouquet
of
pink
bows
and
brussels
lace
that
waves
over
her
placid
red
countenance
smith
wasn
t
his
first
love
nor
indeed
any
love
at
all
but
they
agreed
reasonably
well
and
as
for
poor
nellie
she
is
dead
and
buried
that
was
stuff
and
romance
smith
s
money
set
him
up
in
business
and
smith
is
a
capital
manager
and
he
thanks
god
that
he
isn
t
romantic
and
tells
smith
junior
not
to
read
poetry
or
novels
and
to
stick
to
realities
this
is
the
victory
that
overcometh
the
world
learn
to
be
fat
and
tranquil
to
have
warm
fires
and
good
dinners
to
hang
your
hat
on
the
same
peg
at
the
same
hour
every
day
to
sleep
soundly
all
night
and
never
to
trouble
your
head
with
a
thought
or
imagining
beyond
but
there
are
many
people
besides
smith
who
have
gained
this
victory
have
strangled
their
higher
nature
and
buried
it
and
built
over
its
grave
the
structure
of
their
life
the
better
to
keep
it
down
the
fascinating
whose
life
is
a
whirl
between
ball
and
opera
diamonds
and
schemings
of
admiration
for
herself
and
of
establishments
for
her
daughters
was
a
time
if
you
will
believe
me
when
that
proud
worldly
woman
was
so
humbled
under
the
touch
of
some
mighty
power
that
she
actually
thought
herself
capable
of
being
a
poor
man
s
wife
she
thought
she
could
live
in
a
little
mean
house
on
with
one
servant
and
make
her
own
bonnets
and
mend
her
own
clothes
and
sweep
the
house
mondays
while
betty
washed
for
what
all
because
she
thought
that
there
was
a
man
so
noble
so
true
so
good
so
that
to
live
with
him
in
poverty
to
be
guided
by
him
in
adversity
to
lean
on
him
in
every
rough
place
of
life
was
a
something
nobler
better
purer
more
satisfying
than
french
laces
and
even
madame
roget
s
best
gowns
unfortunately
this
was
all
romance
was
no
such
man
there
was
indeed
a
person
of
very
common
aims
and
worldly
nature
whom
she
had
credited
at
sight
with
an
unlimited
draft
on
all
her
better
nature
and
when
the
hour
of
discovery
came
she
awoke
from
her
dream
with
a
start
and
a
laugh
and
ever
since
has
despised
aspiration
and
been
busy
with
the
of
life
and
feeds
poor
little
mary
jane
who
sits
by
her
in
the
there
with
all
the
fruit
which
she
has
picked
from
the
bitter
tree
of
knowledge
there
is
no
end
of
the
epigrams
and
witticisms
which
she
can
throw
out
this
elegant
on
people
who
marry
for
love
lead
prosy
worky
lives
and
put
on
their
best
cap
with
pink
ribbons
for
sunday
mary
jane
shall
never
make
a
fool
of
herself
but
even
as
she
speaks
poor
mary
jane
s
heart
is
dying
within
her
at
the
vanishing
of
a
pair
of
whiskers
from
an
opposite
box
which
whiskers
the
poor
little
fool
has
credited
with
a
drawn
from
her
own
imaginings
of
all
that
is
grandest
and
most
heroic
most
worshipful
in
man
when
finds
the
glamour
has
fallen
on
her
daughter
she
wonders
she
has
tried
to
keep
novels
out
of
the
girl
s
way
did
she
get
these
notions
all
prosaic
and
all
bitter
disenchanted
people
talk
as
if
poets
and
novelists
romance
they
as
much
as
craters
make
volcanoes
more
what
is
romance
whence
comes
it
plato
spoke
to
the
subject
wisely
in
his
quaint
way
some
two
thousand
years
ago
when
he
said
man
s
soul
in
a
former
state
was
winged
and
soared
among
the
gods
and
so
it
comes
to
pass
that
in
this
life
when
the
soul
by
the
power
of
music
or
poetry
or
the
sight
of
beauty
hath
her
remembrance
quickened
forthwith
there
is
a
struggling
and
a
pricking
pain
as
of
wings
trying
to
come
forth
as
children
in
and
if
an
old
heathen
two
thousand
years
ago
discoursed
thus
gravely
of
the
romantic
part
of
our
nature
whence
comes
it
that
in
christian
lands
we
think
in
so
pagan
a
way
of
it
and
turn
the
whole
care
of
it
to
romancers
and
let
us
look
up
in
fear
and
reverence
and
say
god
is
the
great
maker
of
romance
he
from
whose
hand
came
man
and
woman
who
strung
the
great
harp
of
existence
with
all
its
wild
and
wonderful
and
manifold
chords
and
attuned
them
to
one
another
is
the
great
poet
of
every
impulse
of
beauty
of
heroism
and
every
craving
for
purer
love
fairer
perfection
nobler
type
and
style
of
being
than
that
which
closes
like
a
around
us
in
the
dim
daily
walk
of
life
is
god
s
breath
god
s
impulse
god
s
reminder
to
the
soul
that
there
is
something
higher
sweeter
purer
yet
to
be
attained
therefore
man
or
woman
when
thy
ideal
is
shattered
a
thousand
times
it
must
be
when
the
vision
fades
the
rapture
burns
out
turn
not
away
in
scepticism
and
bitterness
saying
there
is
nothing
better
for
a
man
than
that
he
should
eat
and
drink
but
rather
cherish
the
revelations
of
those
hours
as
prophecies
and
of
something
real
and
possible
yet
to
be
attained
in
the
manhood
of
immortality
the
scoffing
spirit
that
laughs
at
romance
is
an
apple
of
the
devil
s
own
handing
from
the
bitter
tree
of
knowledge
opens
the
eyes
only
to
see
eternal
nakedness
if
ever
you
have
had
a
romantic
uncalculating
boundless
worship
and
belief
in
some
hero
of
your
soul
if
ever
you
have
so
loved
that
all
cold
prudence
all
selfish
worldly
considerations
have
gone
down
like
before
a
river
flooded
with
new
rain
from
heaven
so
that
you
even
forgot
yourself
and
were
ready
to
cast
your
whole
being
into
the
chasm
of
existence
as
an
offering
before
the
feet
of
another
and
all
for
nothing
you
awoke
bitterly
betrayed
and
deceived
still
give
thanks
to
god
that
you
have
had
one
glimpse
of
heaven
the
door
now
shut
will
open
again
rejoice
that
the
noblest
capability
of
your
eternal
inheritance
has
been
made
known
to
you
treasure
it
as
the
highest
honour
of
your
being
that
ever
you
could
so
feel
so
divine
a
guest
ever
possessed
your
soul
by
such
experiences
are
we
taught
the
pathos
the
sacredness
of
life
and
if
we
use
them
wisely
our
eyes
will
ever
after
be
anointed
to
see
what
poems
what
romances
what
sublime
tragedies
lie
around
us
in
the
daily
walk
of
life
written
not
with
ink
but
in
fleshly
tables
of
the
the
dullest
street
of
the
most
prosaic
town
has
matter
in
it
for
more
smiles
more
tears
more
intense
excitement
than
ever
were
written
in
story
or
sung
in
poem
the
reality
is
there
of
which
the
romancer
is
the
recorder
so
much
of
a
plea
we
put
in
boldly
because
we
foresee
grave
heads
beginning
to
shake
over
our
history
and
doubts
rising
in
reverend
and
discreet
minds
whether
this
history
is
going
to
prove
anything
but
a
after
all
we
do
assure
you
right
reverend
sir
and
you
most
discreet
madam
that
it
is
not
going
to
prove
anything
else
and
you
will
find
if
you
will
follow
us
that
there
is
as
much
romance
burning
under
the
of
cold
puritan
preciseness
as
if
had
been
brought
up
to
attend
operas
instead
of
metaphysical
preaching
and
mary
had
been
nourished
on
byron
s
poetry
instead
of
edwards
on
the
the
innocent
credulities
the
subtle
deceptions
that
were
quietly
at
work
under
the
grave
white
curls
of
the
doctor
s
wig
were
exactly
of
the
kind
which
have
beguiled
man
in
all
ages
when
near
the
sovereign
presence
of
her
who
is
born
for
his
destiny
as
for
mary
what
did
it
avail
her
that
she
could
say
the
assembly
s
catechism
from
end
to
end
without
tripping
and
that
every
habit
of
her
life
beat
time
to
practical
realities
steadily
as
the
parlour
clock
the
wildest
italian
singer
or
dancer
nursed
on
nothing
but
excitement
from
her
cradle
never
was
more
thoroughly
possessed
by
the
awful
and
solemn
mystery
of
woman
s
life
than
this
puritan
girl
it
is
quite
true
that
the
next
morning
after
james
s
departure
she
rose
as
usual
in
the
dim
gray
and
was
to
be
seen
opening
the
just
at
the
moment
when
the
birds
were
giving
the
first
little
drowsy
stir
and
chirp
that
she
went
on
setting
the
for
the
two
hired
men
who
were
bound
to
the
fields
with
the
oxen
that
then
she
went
on
skimming
cream
for
the
butter
and
getting
ready
to
churn
and
making
up
biscuit
for
the
doctor
s
breakfast
when
he
and
they
should
sit
down
together
at
a
somewhat
later
hour
and
as
she
moved
about
doing
all
these
things
she
sung
various
scraps
of
old
and
the
good
doctor
who
was
then
busy
with
his
early
exercises
of
devotion
listened
as
he
heard
the
voice
now
here
now
there
and
thought
about
angels
and
the
millennium
solemnly
and
tenderly
there
floated
in
at
his
open
through
the
breezy
lilacs
mixed
with
low
of
kine
and
bleat
of
sheep
and
hum
of
early
wakening
life
the
little
silvery
ripples
of
that
singing
somewhat
mournful
in
its
cadence
as
if
a
gentle
soul
were
striving
to
hush
itself
to
rest
the
words
were
those
of
the
rough
old
version
of
the
psalms
then
in
use
truly
my
waiting
soul
relies
in
silence
god
upon
because
from
him
there
doth
arise
all
my
and
then
came
the
busy
patter
of
the
little
footsteps
without
the
moving
of
chairs
the
clink
of
plates
as
busy
hands
were
arranging
the
table
and
then
again
there
was
a
pause
and
he
thought
she
seemed
to
come
near
to
the
open
window
of
the
adjoining
room
for
the
voice
floated
in
clearer
and
sadder
o
god
to
me
be
merciful
be
merciful
to
me
because
my
soul
for
shelter
safe
betakes
itself
to
thee
yea
in
the
shadow
of
thy
wings
my
refuge
have
i
placed
until
these
sore
calamities
shall
quite
be
the
tone
of
life
in
new
england
so
habitually
earnest
and
solemn
breathed
itself
in
the
grave
and
plaintive
melodies
of
the
tunes
then
sung
in
the
churches
and
so
these
words
though
in
the
saddest
minor
key
did
not
suggest
to
the
listening
ear
of
the
auditor
anything
more
than
that
pensive
religious
calm
in
which
he
delighted
to
repose
a
contrast
indeed
they
were
in
their
melancholy
earnestness
to
the
exuberant
carollings
of
a
robin
who
apparently
attracted
by
them
perched
himself
hard
by
in
the
lilacs
and
struck
up
such
a
merry
as
quite
diverted
the
attention
of
the
fair
singer
in
fact
the
intoxication
breathed
in
the
strain
of
this
little
messenger
whom
god
had
feathered
and
winged
and
filled
to
the
throat
with
ignorant
joy
came
in
singular
contrast
with
the
sadder
notes
breathed
by
that
creature
of
so
much
higher
mould
and
fairer
clay
creature
born
for
an
immortal
life
but
the
good
doctor
was
inly
pleased
when
she
sung
and
when
she
stopped
looked
up
from
his
bible
wistfully
as
missing
something
he
knew
not
what
for
he
scarce
thought
how
pleasant
the
little
voice
was
or
knew
he
had
been
listening
to
it
yet
he
was
in
a
manner
enchanted
by
it
so
thankful
and
happy
that
he
exclaimed
with
fervour
the
lines
are
fallen
unto
me
in
pleasant
places
yea
i
have
a
goodly
so
went
the
world
with
him
full
of
joy
and
praise
because
the
voice
and
the
presence
wherein
lay
his
unsuspected
life
were
securely
near
certainly
and
constantly
a
part
of
his
daily
walk
that
he
had
not
even
the
trouble
to
wish
for
them
but
in
that
other
heart
how
was
it
with
the
sweet
saint
that
was
talking
to
herself
in
psalms
and
hymns
and
spiritual
songs
the
good
child
had
remembered
her
mother
s
parting
words
the
night
before
put
your
mind
upon
your
duties
had
begun
her
first
conscious
exercise
of
thought
with
a
prayer
that
grace
might
be
given
her
to
do
it
but
even
as
she
spoke
mingling
and
interweaving
with
that
golden
thread
of
prayer
was
another
consciousness
a
life
in
another
soul
as
she
prayed
that
the
grace
of
god
might
overshadow
him
shield
him
from
temptation
and
lead
him
up
to
heaven
and
this
prayer
so
got
the
start
of
the
other
that
ere
she
was
aware
she
had
quite
forgotten
self
and
was
feeling
living
thinking
in
that
other
life
the
first
discovery
she
made
when
she
looked
out
into
the
fragrant
orchard
whose
perfumes
steamed
in
at
her
window
and
listened
to
the
first
chirping
of
birds
among
the
old
was
one
that
has
astonished
many
a
person
before
her
was
this
she
found
that
all
that
had
made
life
interesting
to
her
was
suddenly
gone
she
herself
had
not
known
that
for
the
month
past
since
james
came
from
sea
she
had
been
living
in
an
enchanted
land
that
newport
harbour
and
every
rock
and
stone
and
every
mat
of
yellow
seaweed
on
the
shore
that
the
road
between
the
cottage
and
the
white
house
of
zebedee
marvyn
every
every
had
all
had
a
light
and
a
charm
which
were
suddenly
gone
there
had
not
been
an
hour
in
the
day
for
the
last
four
weeks
that
had
not
had
its
unsuspected
interest
he
was
at
the
white
house
because
possibly
he
might
be
going
by
or
coming
in
nay
even
in
church
when
she
stood
up
to
sing
and
thought
she
was
thinking
only
of
god
had
she
not
been
conscious
of
that
tenor
voice
that
poured
itself
out
by
her
side
and
though
afraid
to
turn
her
head
that
way
had
she
not
felt
that
he
was
there
every
moment
every
word
of
the
sermon
and
prayer
for
him
the
very
vigilant
care
which
her
mother
had
taken
to
prevent
private
interviews
had
only
served
to
increase
the
interest
by
throwing
over
it
the
veil
of
constraint
and
mystery
silent
looks
involuntary
starts
things
indicated
not
are
the
most
dangerous
the
most
seductive
aliment
of
thought
to
a
delicate
and
sensitive
nature
if
things
were
said
out
they
might
not
be
said
wisely
might
repel
by
their
freedom
or
disturb
by
their
unfitness
but
what
is
only
looked
is
sent
into
the
soul
through
the
imagination
which
makes
of
it
all
that
the
ideal
faculties
desire
in
a
refined
and
exalted
nature
it
is
very
seldom
that
the
feeling
of
love
when
once
thoroughly
aroused
bears
any
sort
of
relation
to
the
reality
of
the
object
it
is
commonly
an
enkindling
of
the
whole
power
of
the
soul
s
love
for
whatever
she
considers
highest
and
fairest
it
is
in
fact
the
love
of
something
divine
and
unearthly
which
by
a
sort
of
illusion
connects
itself
with
a
personality
properly
speaking
there
is
but
one
true
eternal
object
of
all
that
the
mind
conceives
in
this
trance
of
its
exaltation
disenchantment
must
come
of
course
and
in
a
love
which
terminates
in
happy
marriage
there
is
a
tender
and
gracious
process
by
which
without
shock
or
violence
the
ideal
is
gradually
sunk
in
the
real
which
though
found
faulty
and
earthly
is
still
ever
tenderly
remembered
as
it
seemed
under
the
morning
light
of
that
enchantment
what
mary
loved
so
passionately
that
which
came
between
her
and
god
in
every
prayer
was
not
the
gay
young
dashing
sailor
in
anger
imprudent
of
speech
and
though
generous
in
heart
yet
worldly
in
plans
and
schemings
her
own
ideal
of
a
grand
and
noble
man
such
a
man
as
she
thought
he
might
become
he
stood
glorified
before
image
of
the
strength
that
overcomes
things
physical
of
the
power
of
command
which
controls
men
and
circumstances
of
the
courage
which
disdains
fear
of
the
honour
which
can
not
lie
of
constancy
which
knows
no
shadow
of
turning
of
tenderness
which
protects
the
weak
and
lastly
of
religious
loyalty
which
should
lay
the
golden
crown
of
its
perfected
manhood
at
the
feet
of
a
sovereign
lord
and
redeemer
this
was
the
man
she
loved
and
with
this
regal
mantle
of
glories
she
invested
the
person
called
james
marvyn
and
all
that
she
saw
and
felt
to
be
wanting
she
prayed
for
with
the
faith
of
a
believing
woman
nor
was
she
wrong
for
as
to
every
leaf
and
every
flower
there
is
an
ideal
to
which
the
growth
of
the
plant
is
constantly
urging
so
is
there
an
ideal
to
every
human
being
perfect
form
in
which
it
might
appear
were
every
defect
removed
and
every
characteristic
excellence
stimulated
to
the
highest
point
once
in
an
age
god
sends
to
some
of
us
a
friend
who
loves
in
us
a
false
imagining
an
unreal
character
but
looking
through
all
the
rubbish
of
our
imperfections
loves
in
us
the
divine
ideal
of
our
nature
not
the
man
that
we
are
but
the
angel
that
we
may
be
such
friends
seem
inspired
by
a
divine
gift
of
prophecy
the
mother
of
augustine
who
in
the
midst
of
the
wayward
reckless
youth
of
her
son
beheld
him
in
a
vision
standing
clothed
in
white
a
ministering
priest
at
the
right
hand
of
he
has
stood
for
long
ages
since
could
a
mysterious
foresight
unveil
to
us
this
resurrection
form
of
the
friends
with
whom
we
daily
walk
compassed
about
with
mortal
infirmity
we
should
follow
them
with
faith
and
reverence
through
all
the
disguises
of
human
faults
and
weaknesses
waiting
for
the
manifestation
of
the
sons
of
but
these
wonderful
to
whom
god
grants
such
perception
are
the
exceptions
in
life
yet
sometimes
are
we
blessed
with
one
who
sees
through
us
as
michel
angelo
saw
through
a
block
of
marble
when
he
attacked
it
in
a
divine
fervour
declaring
that
an
angel
was
imprisoned
within
it
and
it
is
often
the
resolute
and
delicate
hand
of
such
a
friend
that
sets
the
angel
free
there
be
who
go
through
this
world
looking
among
their
fellows
with
reverence
as
one
looks
amid
the
dust
and
rubbish
of
old
shops
for
hidden
works
of
titian
and
leonardo
and
finding
them
however
cracked
or
torn
or
painted
over
with
tawdry
daubs
of
pretenders
immediately
recognise
the
divine
original
and
set
themselves
to
cleanse
and
restore
such
be
god
s
real
priests
whose
ordination
and
anointing
are
from
the
holy
spirit
and
he
who
hath
not
this
enthusiasm
is
not
ordained
of
god
though
whole
synods
of
bishops
laid
hands
on
him
many
such
priests
there
be
among
women
for
to
this
silent
ministry
their
nature
calls
them
endowed
as
it
is
with
fineness
of
fibre
and
a
subtile
keenness
of
perception
outrunning
reason
she
of
whom
we
write
was
one
of
these
at
this
very
moment
while
the
crimson
wings
of
morning
were
casting
delicate
reflections
on
tree
and
bush
and
rock
they
were
also
reddening
innumerable
waves
round
a
ship
that
sailed
alone
with
a
wide
horizon
stretching
like
an
eternity
around
it
and
in
the
advancing
morning
stood
a
young
man
thoughtfully
looking
off
into
the
ocean
with
a
book
in
his
marvyn
truly
and
heartily
a
creature
of
this
material
world
as
mary
was
of
the
invisible
and
heavenly
there
are
some
who
seem
made
to
is
such
a
joy
to
them
their
senses
are
so
fully
with
all
outward
things
the
world
is
so
keenly
appreciable
so
much
a
part
of
themselves
they
are
so
conscious
of
power
and
victory
in
the
government
and
control
of
material
things
that
the
moral
and
invisible
life
often
seems
to
hang
tremulous
and
unreal
in
their
minds
like
the
pale
faded
moon
in
the
light
of
a
gorgeous
sunrise
when
brought
face
to
face
with
the
great
truths
of
the
invisible
world
they
stand
related
to
the
higher
wisdom
much
like
the
gorgeous
gay
alcibiades
to
the
divine
socrates
or
like
the
young
man
in
holy
writ
to
him
for
whose
appearing
socrates
longed
gaze
imperfectly
comprehending
and
at
the
call
of
ambition
or
riches
turn
away
sorrowing
so
it
was
with
james
in
full
tide
of
worldly
energy
and
ambition
there
had
been
forming
over
his
mind
that
hard
scepticism
of
the
spiritual
and
exalted
which
men
of
the
world
delight
to
call
practical
sense
he
had
been
suddenly
arrested
and
humbled
by
the
revelation
of
a
nature
so
much
nobler
than
his
own
that
he
seemed
worthless
in
his
own
eyes
he
had
asked
for
love
but
when
love
unveiled
itself
he
felt
like
the
disciple
of
old
in
the
view
of
a
diviner
tenderness
depart
from
me
for
i
am
a
sinful
but
it
is
not
often
that
all
the
current
of
a
life
is
reversed
in
one
hour
and
now
as
james
stood
on
the
ship
s
deck
with
life
passing
around
him
and
everything
drawing
upon
the
strings
of
old
habits
mary
and
her
religion
recurred
to
his
mind
as
some
fair
sweet
inexplicable
vision
where
she
stood
he
saw
but
how
was
ever
to
get
there
seemed
as
incomprehensible
as
how
a
mortal
man
should
pillow
his
form
on
sunset
clouds
he
held
the
little
bible
in
his
hand
as
if
it
were
some
amulet
charmed
by
the
touch
of
a
superior
being
but
when
he
strove
to
read
it
his
thoughts
wandered
and
he
shut
it
troubled
and
unsatisfied
yet
there
were
within
him
yearnings
and
cravings
wants
never
felt
before
the
beginning
of
that
trouble
which
must
ever
precede
the
soul
s
rise
to
a
higher
plan
of
being
there
we
leave
him
we
have
shown
you
now
our
three
different
characters
each
one
in
its
separate
sphere
feeling
the
force
of
that
strongest
and
holiest
power
with
which
it
has
pleased
our
great
author
to
glorify
this
mortal
life
chapter
ix
which
treats
of
things
seen
as
for
example
the
breakfast
it
is
six
o
clock
hired
men
and
oxen
are
gone
stands
before
the
open
snowy
with
its
fresh
cloth
the
old
silver
steaming
up
a
refreshing
perfume
the
doctor
sits
on
one
side
sipping
his
coffee
and
looking
across
the
table
at
mary
who
is
innocently
pleased
at
the
kindly
beaming
in
his
placid
blue
eyes
aunt
katy
scudder
discourses
of
housekeeping
and
fancies
something
must
have
disturbed
the
rising
of
the
cream
as
it
is
not
so
thick
and
yellow
as
wont
now
the
doctor
it
is
to
be
confessed
was
apt
to
fall
into
a
way
of
looking
at
people
such
as
pertains
to
philosophers
and
scholars
generally
that
is
as
if
he
were
looking
through
them
into
the
infinite
which
case
his
gaze
became
so
earnest
and
intent
that
it
would
quite
embarrass
an
uninitiated
person
but
mary
being
used
to
this
style
of
contemplation
was
only
quietly
amused
and
waited
till
some
great
thought
should
loom
up
before
his
mental
vision
which
case
she
hoped
to
hear
from
him
the
good
man
swallowed
his
first
cup
of
coffee
and
spoke
in
the
millennium
i
suppose
there
will
be
such
a
fulness
and
plenty
of
all
the
necessaries
and
conveniences
of
life
that
it
will
not
be
necessary
for
men
and
women
to
spend
the
greater
part
of
their
lives
in
labour
in
order
to
procure
a
living
it
will
not
be
necessary
for
each
one
to
labour
more
than
two
or
three
hours
a
day
more
than
will
conduce
to
health
of
body
and
vigour
of
mind
and
the
rest
of
their
time
they
will
spend
in
reading
and
conversation
and
such
exercises
as
are
necessary
and
proper
to
improve
their
minds
and
make
progress
in
new
england
presents
probably
the
only
example
of
a
successful
commonwealth
founded
on
a
theory
as
a
distinct
experiment
in
the
problem
of
society
it
was
for
this
reason
that
the
minds
of
its
great
thinkers
dwelt
so
much
on
the
final
solution
of
that
problem
in
this
world
the
fact
of
a
future
millennium
was
a
favourite
doctrine
of
the
great
leading
theologians
of
new
england
and
dwelt
upon
it
with
a
peculiar
partiality
indeed
it
was
the
solace
and
refuge
of
his
soul
when
oppressed
with
the
discouragements
which
always
attend
things
actual
to
dwell
upon
and
draw
out
in
detail
the
splendours
of
this
perfect
future
which
was
destined
to
glorify
the
world
nobody
therefore
at
the
cottage
was
in
the
least
surprised
when
there
dropped
into
the
flow
of
their
daily
life
these
sparkling
bits
of
ore
which
their
friend
had
dug
in
his
explorations
of
a
future
canaan
fact
they
served
to
raise
the
hackneyed
present
out
of
the
level
of
mere
commonplace
but
how
will
it
be
possible
inquired
scudder
that
so
much
less
work
will
suffice
in
those
days
to
do
all
that
is
to
be
done
because
of
the
great
advance
of
arts
and
sciences
which
will
take
place
before
those
days
said
the
doctor
whereby
everything
shall
be
performed
with
so
much
greater
ease
the
great
increase
of
disinterested
love
whereby
the
skill
and
talents
of
those
who
have
much
shall
make
up
for
the
weakness
of
those
who
have
less
yes
continued
after
a
pause
all
the
careful
marthas
in
those
days
will
have
no
excuse
for
not
sitting
at
the
feet
of
jesus
there
will
be
no
cumbering
with
much
serving
the
church
will
have
only
maries
in
those
this
remark
made
without
the
slightest
personal
intention
called
a
curious
smile
into
scudder
s
face
which
was
reflected
in
a
slight
blush
from
mary
s
when
the
crack
of
a
whip
and
the
rattling
of
disturbed
the
conversation
and
drew
all
eyes
to
the
door
there
appeared
the
vision
of
zebedee
marvyn
s
stored
with
barrels
boxes
and
baskets
over
which
candace
sat
throned
triumphant
her
black
face
and
turban
glowing
in
the
fresh
morning
with
a
hearty
joyous
light
as
she
pulled
up
the
reins
and
shouted
to
the
horse
to
stop
with
a
voice
that
might
have
done
credit
to
any
man
living
dear
me
if
there
isn
t
candace
said
mary
queen
of
ethiopia
said
the
doctor
who
sometimes
adventured
a
very
placid
joke
the
doctor
was
universally
known
in
all
the
neighbourhood
as
a
sort
of
friend
and
of
the
negro
race
he
had
devoted
himself
to
their
interests
with
a
zeal
unusual
in
those
days
his
church
numbered
more
of
them
than
any
in
newport
and
his
hours
of
leisure
from
study
were
often
spent
in
lowliest
visitations
among
them
hearing
their
stories
consoling
their
sorrows
advising
and
directing
their
plans
teaching
them
reading
and
writing
and
he
often
drew
hard
on
his
slender
salary
to
assist
them
in
their
emergencies
and
distresses
this
unusual
condescension
on
his
part
was
repaid
on
theirs
with
all
the
warmth
of
their
race
and
candace
in
particular
devoted
herself
to
the
doctor
with
all
the
force
of
her
being
there
was
a
legend
current
in
the
neighbourhood
that
the
first
efforts
to
catechize
candace
were
not
eminently
successful
her
modes
of
contemplating
theological
tenets
being
so
peculiarly
from
her
own
individual
point
of
view
that
it
was
hard
to
get
her
subscription
to
a
received
opinion
on
the
venerable
clause
in
the
catechism
in
particular
which
declares
that
all
men
sinned
in
adam
and
fell
with
him
candace

it
was
of
no
use
of
course
to
tell
candace
of
all
the
explanations
of
this
redoubtable
passage
potential

and

presence
and
representative

and
even
in
the
catechizing
class
of
the
doctor
himself
if
this
answer
came
to
her
she
sat
black
and
frowning
in
stony
silence
even
in
his
reverend
presence
candace
was
often
reminded
that
the
doctor
believed
the
catechism
and
that
she
was
differing
from
a
great
and
good
man
but
the
argument
made
no
manner
of
impression
on
her
till
one
day
a
cousin
of
hers
whose
condition
under
a
hard
master
had
often
moved
her
compassion
came
in
overjoyed
to
recount
to
her
how
owing
to
s
exertions
he
had
gained
his
freedom
the
doctor
himself
had
in
person
gone
from
house
to
house
raising
the
sum
for
his
redemption
and
when
more
yet
was
wanting
supplied
it
by

and
accordingly
at
the
next
catechizing
the
doctor
s
astonishment
was
great
when
candace
pressed
up
to
him
exclaiming

and
this
very
thorough
profession
of
faith
was
followed
on
the
part
of

by
years
of

most
strenuous
orthodoxy

please
come
to
tea
dis
arternoon
thank
your
mistress
candace
said
scudder
mary
and
i
will
come
the
doctor
perhaps
looking
at
the
good
man
who
had
relapsed
into
meditation
and
was
eating
his
breakfast
without
taking
note
of
anything
going
on
it
will
be
time
enough
to
tell
him
of
it
she
said
to
mary
when
we
have
to
wake
him
up
to
dress
so
we
won
t
disturb
him
to
mary
the
prospect
of
the
visit
was
a
pleasant
one
for
reasons
which
she
scarce
gave
a
definite
form
to
of
course
like
a
good
girl
she
had
come
to
a
fixed
and
settled
resolution
to
think
of
james
as
little
as
possible
but
when
the
path
of
duty
lay
directly
along
scenes
and
among
people
fitted
to
recall
him
it
was
more
agreeable
than
if
it
had
lain
in
another
direction
added
to
this
a
very
tender
and
silent
friendship
subsisted
between
marvyn
and
mary
in
which
besides
similarity
of
mind
and
intellectual
pursuits
there
was
a
deep
unspoken
element
of
sympathy
candace
watched
the
light
in
mary
s
eyes
with
the
instinctive
shrewdness
by
which
her
race
seem
to
divine
the
thoughts
and
feelings
of
their
superiors
and
chuckled
to
herself
internally
without
ever
having
been
made
a
by
any
party
or
having
a
word
said
to
or
before
her
still
the
whole
position
of
affairs
was
as
clear
to
her
as
if
she
had
seen
it
on
a
map
she
had
appreciated
at
once
scudder
s
coolness
james
s
devotion
and
mary
s
perplexity
inly
resolved
that
if
the
little
maiden
did
not
think
of
james
in
his
absence
it
should
not
be
her
fault
laws
miss
scudder
she
said

she
added
with
the
triumphant
laugh
which
usually
chorused
her
conversation
and
turning
to
the
doctor
who
aroused
by
her
loud
and
vigorous
strain
was
attending
with
interest
to
her
well
candace
he
said
we
all

candace
said
the
doctor
keep
on
your
prayers
stand
as
much
chance
with
god
as
if
you
were
a
crowned
queen
the
lord
is
no
respecter
of
dat
s
what
he
a
n
t
doctor
dere
s
where
i
gree
wid
him
said
candace
as
she
gathered
her
baskets
vigorously
together
and
after
a
sweeping
curtsy
went
sailing
down
to
her
waggon
full
laden
with
content
shouting
a
hearty
good
mornin
missus
with
the
full
power
of
her
cheerful
lungs
as
she
rode
off
as
the
doctor
looked
after
her
the
simple
pleased
expression
with
which
he
had
watched
her
gradually
faded
and
there
passed
over
his
broad
good
face
a
shadow
as
of
a
cloud
on
a
what
a
shame
it
is
he
said
what
a
scandal
and
disgrace
to
the
protestant
religion
that
christians
of
america
should
openly
practise
and
countenance
this
enslaving
of
the
africans
i
have
for
a
long
time
holden
my
the
lord
forgive
me
i
believe
the
time
is
coming
when
i
must
utter
my
voice
i
can
not
go
down
to
the
wharves
or
among
the
shipping
without
these
poor
dumb
creatures
look
at
me
so
that
i
am
ashamed
as
if
they
asked
me
what
i
a
christian
minister
was
doing
that
i
did
not
come
to
their
help
i
must
scudder
looked
grave
at
this
earnest
announcement
she
had
heard
many
like
it
before
and
they
always
filled
her
with
alarm
we
tell
you
why
well
then
it
was
not
because
she
was
not
a
thoroughly
indoctrinated
woman
her
husband
who
did
all
her
thinking
for
her
had
been
a
man
of
ideas
beyond
his
day
and
never
for
a
moment
countenanced
the
right
of
slavery
so
far
as
to
buy
or
own
a
servant
or
attendant
of
any
kind
and
scudder
had
always
followed
decidedly
along
the
path
of
his
opinions
and
practice
and
never
hesitated
to
declare
the
reasons
for
the
faith
that
was
in
her
but
if
any
of
us
could
imagine
an
angel
dropped
down
out
of
heaven
with
wings
ideas
notions
manners
and
customs
all
fresh
from
that
very
different
country
we
might
easily
suppose
that
the
most
pious
and
orthodox
family
might
find
the
task
of
presenting
him
in
general
society
and
piloting
him
along
the
courses
of
this
world
a
very
delicate
and
embarrassing
one
however
much
they
might
reverence
him
on
their
own
private
account
their
hearts
would
probably
sink
within
them
at
the
idea
of
allowing
him
to
expand
himself
according
to
his
previous
nature
and
habits
in
the
great
world
without
in
like
manner
men
of
high
unworldly
natures
are
often
reverenced
by
those
who
are
somewhat
puzzled
what
to
do
with
them
practically
scudder
considered
the
doctor
as
a
superior
being
possessed
by
a
holy
helplessness
in
all
things
material
and
temporal
which
imposed
on
her
the
necessity
of
thinking
and
caring
for
him
and
prevising
the
earthly
and
material
aspects
of
his
affairs
there
was
not
in
newport
a
more
thriving
and
reputable
business
at
that
time
than
the
large
fortunes
were
constantly
being
turned
out
in
it
and
what
better
providential
witness
of
its
justice
could
most
people
require
beside
this
in
their
own
little
church
she
reflected
with
alarm
that
simeon
brown
the
richest
and
most
liberal
supporter
of
the
society
had
been
and
was
then
drawing
all
his
wealth
from
this
source
and
rapidly
there
flashed
before
her
mind
a
picture
of
one
and
another
influential
persons
who
were
holders
of
slaves
therefore
when
the
doctor
announced
i
must
testify
she
rattled
her
uneasily
and
answered
in
what
way
doctor
do
you
think
of
bearing
testimony
the
subject
i
think
is
a
very
difficult
difficult
i
think
no
subject
can
be
clearer
if
we
were
right
in
our
war
for
liberty
we
are
wrong
in
making
slaves
or
keeping
oh
i
did
not
mean
said
scudder
that
it
was
difficult
to
understand
the
subject
the
of
the
matter
is
clear
but
what
to
is
the
i
shall
preach
about
it
said
the
doctor
my
mind
has
run
upon
it
some
time
i
shall
show
to
the
house
of
judah
their
sin
in
this
i
fear
there
will
be
great
offence
given
said
scudder
there
s
simeon
brown
one
of
our
largest
supporters
is
in
the
ah
yes
he
will
come
out
of
it
course
he
will
is
all
right
all
clear
i
was
delighted
with
the
clearness
of
his
views
the
other
night
and
thought
then
of
bringing
them
to
bear
on
this
point
as
others
were
present
i
deferred
it
but
i
can
show
him
that
it
follows
logically
from
his
principles
i
am
confident
of
i
think
you
ll
be
disappointed
in
him
doctor
think
he
ll
be
angry
and
get
up
a
commotion
and
leave
the
madam
said
the
doctor
do
you
suppose
that
a
man
who
would
be
willing
even
to
give
up
his
eternal
salvation
for
the
greatest
good
of
the
universe
could
hesitate
about
a
few
paltry
thousands
that
perish
in
the
using
he
may
feel
willing
to
give
up
his
soul
said
scudder
naïvely
but
i
don
t
think
he
ll
give
up
his
ships
s
quite
another
matter
won
t
see
it
to
be
his
then
ma
am
he
ll
be
a
hypocrite
a
gross
hypocrite
if
he
won
t
said
the
doctor
it
is
not
christian
charity
to
think
it
of
him
i
shall
call
upon
him
this
morning
and
tell
him
my
but
doctor
exclaimed
scudder
with
a
start
pray
think
a
little
more
of
it
you
know
a
great
many
things
depend
on
him
why
he
has
subscribed
for
twenty
copies
of
your
system
of
i
hope
you
ll
remember
and
why
should
i
remember
that
said
the
doctor
turning
round
suddenly
enkindled
his
blue
eyes
flashing
out
of
their
usual
misty
calm
what
has
my
system
of
theology
to
do
with
the
matter
illustration
minister
is
sampson
low
son
march
why
said
scudder
it
s
of
more
importance
to
get
right
views
of
the
gospel
before
the
world
than
anything
else
is
it
not
if
by
any
imprudence
in
treating
influential
people
this
should
be
prevented
more
harm
than
good
would
be
madam
said
the
doctor
i
d
sooner
my
system
should
be
sunk
in
the
sea
than
it
should
be
a
millstone
round
my
neck
to
keep
me
from
my
duty
let
god
take
care
of
my
theology
i
must
do
my
and
as
the
doctor
spoke
he
straightened
himself
to
the
full
dignity
of
his
height
his
face
kindling
with
an
unconscious
majesty
and
as
he
turned
his
eye
fell
on
mary
who
was
standing
with
her
slender
figure
dilated
her
large
blue
eye
wide
and
bright
in
a
sort
of
trance
of
solemn
feeling
the
strong
heroic
man
started
to
see
this
answer
to
his
higher
soul
in
the
sweet
tremulous
mirror
of
womanhood
one
of
those
lightning
glances
passed
between
his
eyes
and
hers
which
are
the
freemasonry
of
noble
spirits
by
a
sudden
impulse
they
approached
each
other
he
took
both
her
outstretched
hands
looked
down
into
her
face
with
a
look
full
of
admiration
and
a
sort
of
naïve
wonder
as
if
her
inspired
silence
had
been
a
voice
to
him
he
laid
his
hand
on
her
head
and
said
god
bless
you
child
out
of
the
mouth
of
babes
and
sucklings
hast
thou
ordained
strength
because
of
thine
enemies
that
thou
mightest
still
the
enemy
and
the
in
a
moment
he
was
gone
mary
said
scudder
laying
her
hand
on
her
daughter
s
arm
the
doctor
loves
you
i
know
he
does
mother
said
mary
innocently
and
i
love
him
is
a
noble
grand
man
scudder
looked
keenly
at
her
daughter
mary
s
eye
was
as
calm
as
a
june
sky
and
she
began
composedly
gathering
up
the
teacups
she
did
not
understand
me
thought
the
mother
chapter
x
the
test
of
theology
the
doctor
went
immediately
to
his
study
and
put
on
his
best
coat
and
his
wig
and
surmounting
them
by
his
cocked
hat
walked
manfully
out
of
the
house
with
his
cane
in
his
hand
there
he
goes
said
scudder
looking
regretfully
after
him
he
is
a
good
man
he
has
not
the
least
idea
how
to
get
along
in
the
world
he
never
thinks
of
anything
but
what
is
true
he
hasn
t
a
particle
of
management
about
seems
to
me
said
mary
that
is
like
an
apostle
you
know
mother
paul
says
in
simplicity
and
godly
sincerity
not
with
fleshly
wisdom
but
by
the
grace
of
god
we
have
had
our
conversation
in
the
to
be
sure
is
just
the
doctor
said
scudder
that
s
as
like
him
as
if
it
had
been
written
for
him
but
that
kind
of
way
somehow
don
t
seem
to
do
in
our
times
it
won
t
answer
with
simeon
brown
know
the
man
i
know
just
as
well
now
how
it
will
all
seem
to
him
and
what
will
be
the
upshot
of
this
talk
if
the
doctor
goes
there
it
won
t
do
any
good
if
it
would
i
would
be
willing
i
feel
as
much
desire
to
have
this
horrid
trade
in
slaves
stopped
as
anybody
your
father
i
m
sure
said
enough
about
it
in
his
time
but
then
i
know
it
s
no
use
trying
just
as
if
simeon
brown
when
he
is
making
his
hundreds
of
thousands
in
it
is
going
to
be
persuaded
to
give
it
up
he
won
ll
only
turn
against
the
doctor
and
won
t
pay
his
part
of
the
salary
and
will
use
his
influence
to
get
up
a
party
against
him
and
our
church
will
be
broken
up
and
the
doctor
driven
away
s
all
that
will
come
of
it
and
all
the
good
that
he
is
now
doing
to
these
poor
negroes
will
be
overthrown
they
never
did
have
so
good
a
friend
if
he
would
stay
here
and
work
gradually
and
get
his
system
of
theology
printed
simeon
brown
would
help
at
that
only
drop
words
in
season
here
and
there
till
people
are
brought
along
with
him
why
something
might
be
done
but
now
it
s
just
the
most
imprudent
thing
a
man
could
but
mother
if
it
really
is
a
sin
to
trade
in
slaves
and
hold
them
i
don
t
see
how
he
can
help
himself
i
quite
agree
with
him
i
don
t
see
how
he
came
to
let
it
go
so
long
as
he
well
said
scudder
if
worst
comes
to
worst
and
he
will
do
it
i
for
one
shall
stand
by
him
to
the
and
i
for
another
said
mary
i
would
like
him
to
talk
with
cousin
zebedee
about
it
said
scudder
when
we
are
up
there
this
afternoon
we
will
introduce
the
conversation
he
is
a
good
sound
man
and
the
doctor
thinks
much
of
him
and
perhaps
he
may
shed
some
light
upon
this
meanwhile
the
doctor
was
making
the
best
of
his
way
in
the
strength
of
his
purpose
to
test
the
orthodoxy
of
simeon
brown
honest
old
granite
boulder
that
he
was
no
sooner
did
he
perceive
a
truth
than
he
rolled
after
it
with
all
the
massive
gravitation
of
his
being
inconsiderate
as
to
what
might
lie
in
his
way
which
it
is
to
be
inferred
that
with
all
his
intellect
and
goodness
he
would
have
been
a
very
clumsy
and
troublesome
inmate
of
the
modern
american
church
how
many
societies
boards
colleges
and
other
good
institutions
have
reason
to
congratulate
themselves
that
he
has
long
been
among
the
saints
with
him
logic
was
everything
and
to
perceive
a
truth
and
not
act
in
logical
sequence
from
it
a
thing
so
incredible
that
he
had
not
yet
enlarged
his
capacity
to
take
it
in
as
a
possibility
that
a
man
should
refuse
to
hear
truth
he
could
understand
in
fact
he
had
good
reason
to
think
the
majority
of
his
townsmen
had
no
leisure
to
give
to
that
purpose
that
men
hearing
truth
should
dispute
it
and
argue
stoutly
against
it
he
could
also
understand
but
that
a
man
could
admit
a
truth
and
not
admit
the
plain
practice
resulting
from
it
was
to
him
a
thing
incomprehensible
therefore
spite
of
katy
scudder
s
discouraging
observations
our
good
doctor
walked
stoutly
and
with
a
trusting
heart
at
the
moment
when
the
doctor
with
a
silent
uplifting
of
his
soul
to
his
invisible
sovereign
passed
out
of
his
study
on
this
errand
where
was
the
disciple
whom
he
went
to
seek
in
a
small
dirty
room
down
by
the
wharf
the
windows
veiled
by
cobwebs
and
dingy
with
the
accumulated
dust
of
ages
he
sat
in
a
greasy
leathern
chair
by
a
rickety
on
which
were
a
great
pewter
inkstand
an
and
divers
papers
tied
with
red
tape
opposite
to
him
was
seated
a
individual
man
of
about
forty
whose
round
head
shaggy
eyebrows
small
keen
eyes
broad
chest
and
heavy
muscles
showed
a
preponderance
of
the
animal
and
brutal
over
the
intellectual
and
spiritual
this
was
scroggs
the
agent
of
a
rice
plantation
who
had
come
on
bringing
an
order
for
a
new
relay
of
negroes
to
supply
the
deficit
occasioned
by
fever
dysentery
and
other
causes
in
their
last
year
s
stock
the
fact
is
said
simeon
this
last
wasn
t
as
good
a
one
as
usual
we
lost
more
than
a
third
of
it
so
we
can
t
afford
to
put
them
a
penny
ay
said
the
but
then
there
are
so
many
women
well
said
simeon
women
a
n
t
so
strong
perhaps
to
start
with
but
then
they
stan
it
out
perhaps
in
the
long
run
better
they
re
more
patient
of
these
men
the
mandingoes
particularly
are
pretty
troublesome
to
manage
we
lost
a
splendid
fellow
coming
over
on
this
very
voyage
let
em
on
deck
for
air
and
this
fellow
managed
to
get
himself
loose
and
fought
like
a
dragon
he
settled
one
of
our
men
with
his
fist
and
another
with
a
marlinespike
that
he
caught
in
fact
they
had
to
shoot
him
down
you
ll
have
his
wife
there
s
his
son
too
fellow
fifteen
year
old
by
his
what
that
lame
one
oh
he
a
n
t
lame
s
nothing
but
the
cramps
from
stowing
you
know
of
course
they
are
more
or
less
stiff
he
s
as
sound
as
a
don
t
much
like
to
buy
relations
on
account
of
their
hatching
up
mischief
together
said
scroggs
oh
that
s
all
humbug
you
must
keep
em
from
coming
together
anyway
it
s
about
as
broad
as
tis
long
there
ll
be
wives
and
husbands
and
children
among
em
before
long
start
em
as
you
will
and
then
this
woman
will
work
better
for
having
the
boy
she
s
kinder
set
on
him
she
jabbers
lots
of
lingo
to
him
day
and
too
much
i
doubt
said
the
overseer
with
a
shrug
well
well
ll
tell
you
said
simeon
rising
i
ve
got
a
few
errands
up
town
and
you
just
step
over
with
matlock
and
look
over
the
stock
set
aside
any
that
you
want
and
when
i
see
em
all
together
i
ll
tell
you
just
what
you
shall
have
em
for
i
ll
be
back
in
an
hour
or
and
so
saying
simeon
brown
called
an
underling
from
an
adjoining
room
and
committing
his
customer
to
his
care
took
his
way
in
a
serene
frame
of
mind
like
a
man
who
comes
from
the
calm
performance
of
duty
just
as
he
came
upon
the
street
where
was
situated
his
own
large
and
somewhat
pretentious
mansion
the
tall
figure
of
the
doctor
loomed
in
sight
sailing
majestically
down
upon
him
making
a
signal
to
attract
his
attention
good
morning
doctor
said
simeon
good
morning
brown
said
the
doctor
i
was
looking
for
you
i
did
not
quite
finish
the
subject
we
were
talking
about
at
scudder
s
table
last
night
i
thought
i
should
like
to
go
on
with
it
a
with
all
my
heart
doctor
said
simeon
not
a
little
flattered
turn
right
in
brown
will
be
about
her
house
business
and
we
will
have
the
all
to
ourselves
come
right
the
of
simeon
brown
s
house
was
an
intermediate
apartment
between
the
ineffable
glories
of
the
front
parlour
and
that
court
of
the
gentiles
the
kitchen
for
the
presence
of
a
large
train
of
negro
servants
made
the
latter
apartment
an
altogether
different
institution
from
the
of
katy
scudder
this
was
a
apartment
finished
with
the
heavy
oaken
beams
of
the
wall
left
full
in
sight
boarded
over
and
painted
two
windows
looked
out
on
the
street
and
another
into
a
sort
of
where
three
black
wenches
each
with
a
broom
pretended
to
be
sweeping
but
were
in
fact
chattering
and
laughing
like
so
many
crows
on
one
side
of
the
room
stood
a
heavy
mahogany
sideboard
covered
with
decanters
labelled
gin
brandy
rum
for
simeon
was
held
to
be
a
provider
of
none
but
the
best
in
his
housekeeping
heavy
mahogany
chairs
with
crewel
coverings
stood
sentry
about
the
room
and
the
fireplace
was
flanked
by
two
broad
covered
with
stamped
leather
on
ushering
the
doctor
into
this
apartment
simeon
courteously
led
him
to
the
sideboard
we
mus
n
t
make
our
discussions
too
doctor
he
said
what
will
you
take
thank
you
sir
said
the
doctor
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
nothing
this
and
depositing
his
cocked
hat
in
a
chair
he
settled
himself
into
one
of
the
leathern
easy
chairs
and
dropping
his
hands
upon
his
knees
looked
fixedly
before
him
like
a
man
who
is
studying
how
to
enter
upon
an
inwardly
absorbing
subject
well
doctor
said
simeon
seating
himself
opposite
sipping
comfortably
at
a
glass
of
our
views
appear
to
be
making
a
noise
in
the
world
everything
is
preparing
for
your
volumes
and
when
they
appear
the
battle
of
new
divinity
i
think
may
fairly
be
considered
as
let
us
consider
that
though
a
woman
may
forget
her
firstborn
yet
a
man
can
not
forget
his
own
system
of
theology
therein
if
he
be
a
true
man
is
the
very
elixir
and
essence
of
all
that
is
valuable
and
hopeful
to
the
universe
and
considering
this
let
us
appreciate
the
settled
purpose
of
our
friend
whom
even
this
tempting
bait
did
not
swerve
from
the
end
which
he
had
in
view
mr
brown
he
said
all
our
theology
is
as
a
drop
in
the
ocean
of
god
s
majesty
to
whose
glory
we
must
be
ready
to
make
any
and
every
certainly
said
brown
not
exactly
comprehending
the
turn
the
doctor
s
thoughts
were
taking
and
the
glory
of
god
consisteth
in
the
happiness
of
all
his
rational
universe
each
in
his
proportion
according
to
his
separate
amount
of
being
so
that
when
we
devote
ourselves
to
god
s
glory
it
is
the
same
as
saying
that
we
devote
ourselves
to
the
highest
happiness
of
his
created
that
s
clear
sir
said
simeon
rubbing
his
hands
and
taking
out
his
watch
to
see
the
time
the
doctor
hitherto
had
spoken
in
a
laborious
manner
like
a
man
who
is
slowly
lifting
a
heavy
bucket
of
thought
out
of
an
internal
well
i
am
glad
to
find
your
mind
so
clear
on
this
point
brown
the
more
so
as
i
feel
that
we
must
immediately
proceed
to
apply
our
principles
at
whatever
sacrifice
of
worldly
goods
and
i
trust
sir
that
you
are
one
who
at
the
call
of
your
master
would
not
hesitate
even
to
lay
down
all
your
worldly
possessions
for
the
greater
good
of
the
i
trust
so
sir
said
simeon
rather
uneasily
and
without
the
most
distant
idea
what
could
be
coming
next
in
the
mind
of
his
reverend
friend
did
it
never
occur
to
you
my
friend
said
the
doctor
that
the
enslaving
of
the
african
race
is
a
clear
violation
of
the
great
law
which
commands
us
to
love
our
neighbour
as
ourselves
a
dishonour
upon
the
christian
religion
more
particularly
in
us
americans
whom
the
lord
hath
so
marvellously
protected
in
our
recent
struggle
for
our
own
liberty
simeon
started
at
the
first
words
of
this
address
much
as
if
some
one
had
dashed
a
bucket
of
water
on
his
head
and
after
that
rose
uneasily
walking
the
room
and
playing
with
the
seals
of
his
watch
never
regarded
it
in
this
light
he
said
possibly
not
my
friend
said
the
doctor
so
much
doth
established
custom
blind
the
minds
of
the
best
of
men
but
since
i
have
given
more
particular
attention
to
the
case
of
the
poor
negroes
here
in
newport
the
thought
has
more
and
more
laboured
in
my
mind
especially
as
our
own
struggles
for
liberty
have
turned
my
attention
to
the
rights
which
every
human
creature
hath
before
god
that
i
find
much
in
my
former
blindness
and
the
comparative
dumbness
i
have
heretofore
maintained
on
this
subject
wherewith
to
reproach
myself
for
though
i
have
borne
somewhat
of
a
testimony
i
have
not
given
it
that
force
which
so
important
a
subject
required
i
am
humbled
before
god
for
my
neglect
and
resolved
now
by
his
grace
to
leave
no
stone
unturned
till
this
iniquity
be
purged
away
from
our
well
doctor
said
simeon
you
are
certainly
touching
on
a
very
dark
and
difficult
subject
and
one
in
which
it
is
hard
to
find
out
the
path
of
duty
perhaps
it
will
be
well
to
bear
it
in
mind
and
by
looking
at
it
prayerfully
some
light
may
arise
there
are
such
great
obstacles
in
the
way
that
i
do
not
see
at
present
what
can
be
done
do
you
doctor
i
intend
to
preach
on
the
subject
next
sunday
and
hereafter
devote
my
best
energies
in
the
most
public
way
to
this
great
work
said
the
doctor
you
doctor
now
immediately
why
it
appears
to
me
you
can
not
do
it
you
are
the
most
unfit
man
possible
whosoever
s
duty
it
may
be
it
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be
yours
you
already
have
more
on
your
shoulders
than
you
can
carry
you
are
hardly
able
to
keep
your
ground
now
with
all
the
odium
of
this
new
theology
upon
you
such
an
effort
would
break
up
your
church
the
chance
you
have
to
do
good
here
the
publication
of
your
if
it
s
nobody
s
system
but
mine
the
world
won
t
lose
much
if
it
never
be
published
but
if
it
be
god
s
system
nothing
can
hinder
its
appearing
besides
brown
i
ought
not
to
be
one
man
alone
i
count
on
your
help
i
hold
it
as
a
special
providence
brown
that
in
our
own
church
an
opportunity
will
be
given
to
testify
to
the
reality
of
disinterested
benevolence
how
glorious
the
opportunity
for
a
man
to
come
out
and
testify
by
sacrificing
his
worldly
living
and
business
if
you
brown
will
at
once
at
whatever
sacrifice
quit
all
connection
with
this
detestable
and
diabolical
you
will
exhibit
a
spectacle
over
which
angels
will
rejoice
and
which
will
strengthen
and
encourage
me
to
preach
and
write
and
simeon
brown
s
usual
demeanour
was
that
of
the
most
leathery
imperturbability
in
calm
theological
reasoning
he
could
demonstrate
in
the
dryest
tone
that
if
the
eternal
torment
of
six
bodies
and
souls
were
absolutely
the
necessary
means
for
preserving
the
eternal
blessedness
of
benevolence
would
require
us
to
rejoice
in
it
not
in
itself
considered
but
in
view
of
greater
good
and
when
he
spoke
not
a
nerve
quivered
the
great
mysterious
sorrow
with
which
the
creation
groaneth
and
travaileth
the
sorrow
from
which
angels
veil
their
faces
never
had
touched
one
vibrating
chord
either
of
body
or
soul
and
he
laid
down
the
obligations
of
man
to
unconditional
submission
in
a
style
which
would
have
affected
a
person
of
delicate
sensibility
much
like
being
mentally
sawn
in
sunder
benevolence
when
simeon
brown
spoke
of
it
seemed
the
grimmest
and
unloveliest
of
gorgons
for
his
mind
seemed
to
resemble
those
fountains
which
petrify
everything
that
falls
into
them
but
the
animals
have
a
vital
and
sensitive
part
though
only
so
large
as
the
point
of
a
needle
and
the
doctor
s
innocent
proposition
to
simeon
to
abandon
his
whole
worldly
estate
for
his
principles
touched
this
spot
when
benevolence
required
but
the
acquiescence
in
certain
possible
things
which
might
be
supposed
to
happen
to
his
soul
which
after
all
he
was
comfortably
certain
never
would
happen
or
the
acquiescence
in
certain
suppositious
sacrifices
for
the
good
of
that
most
intangible
of
all
abstractions
being
in
general
it
was
a
dry
calm
subject
but
when
it
concerned
the
immediate
giving
up
of
his
and
a
transfer
of
business
attended
with
all
that
confusion
and
loss
which
he
foresaw
at
a
glance
then
he
and
felt
too
much
to
see
clearly
his
swarthy
face
flushed
his
little
blue
eye
kindled
he
walked
up
to
the
doctor
and
began
speaking
in
the
short
energetic
sentences
of
a
man
thoroughly
awake
to
what
he
is
talking
about
doctor
you
re
too
fast
you
are
not
a
practical
man
doctor
you
are
good
in
your
pulpit
better
your
theology
is
clear
can
argue
better
but
come
to
practical
matters
why
business
has
its
laws
doctor
ministers
are
the
most
unfit
men
in
the
world
to
talk
on
such
subjects
it
s
departing
from
their
sphere
they
talk
about
what
they
don
t
understand
besides
you
take
too
much
for
granted
i
m
not
sure
that
this
trade
is
an
evil
i
want
to
be
convinced
of
it
i
m
sure
it
s
a
favour
to
these
poor
creatures
to
bring
them
to
a
christian
land
they
are
a
thousand
times
better
off
here
they
can
hear
the
gospel
and
have
some
chance
of
if
we
want
to
get
the
gospel
to
the
africans
said
the
doctor
why
not
send
whole
of
missionaries
to
them
and
carry
civilization
and
the
arts
and
christianity
to
africa
instead
of
stirring
up
wars
tempting
them
to
ravage
each
other
s
territories
that
we
may
get
the
booty
think
of
the
numbers
killed
in
the
wars
all
that
die
on
the
passage
is
there
any
need
of
killing
men
to
give
the
hundredth
one
the
gospel
when
we
could
give
the
gospel
to
them
all
ah
brown
what
if
all
the
money
spent
in
fitting
out
ships
to
bring
the
poor
negroes
here
so
prejudiced
against
christianity
that
they
regard
it
with
fear
and
aversion
had
been
spent
in
sending
it
to
them
africa
would
have
been
covered
with
towns
and
villages
rejoicing
in
civilization
and
christianity
doctor
you
are
a
dreamer
replied
simeon
an
unpractical
man
your
situation
prevents
your
knowing
anything
of
real
amen
the
lord
be
praised
there
for
said
the
doctor
with
a
flush
mounting
to
his
cheek
showing
the
burning
brand
of
a
smouldering
fire
of
indignation
now
let
me
just
talk
doctor
has
its
time
and
place
just
as
much
as
theology
and
if
you
have
the
most
theology
i
flatter
myself
i
have
the
most
a
must
have
it
now
just
look
at
your
situation
you
stand
you
ve
got
a
most
important
work
to
do
in
order
to
do
it
you
must
keep
your
pulpit
you
must
keep
our
church
together
we
are
few
and
weak
we
are
a
minority
now
there
s
not
an
influential
man
in
your
society
that
don
t
either
hold
slaves
or
engage
in
the
trade
and
if
you
open
upon
this
subject
as
you
are
going
to
do
you
ll
just
divide
and
destroy
the
church
all
men
are
not
like
you
men
are
men
and
will
be
till
they
are
thoroughly
sanctified
which
never
happens
in
this
life
there
will
be
an
instant
and
most
unfavourable
agitation
minds
will
be
turned
off
from
the
discussion
of
the
great
saving
doctrines
of
the
gospel
to
a
side
issue
you
will
be
turned
out
and
you
know
doctor
you
are
not
appreciated
as
you
ought
to
be
and
it
won
t
be
easy
for
you
to
get
a
new
settlement
and
then
subscriptions
will
all
drop
off
from
your
book
and
you
won
t
be
able
to
get
that
out
and
all
this
good
will
be
lost
to
the
world
just
for
want
of
there
is
a
kind
of
wisdom
in
what
you
say
brown
replied
the
doctor
naïvely
but
i
fear
much
that
it
is
the
wisdom
spoken
in
james
iii
which
descendeth
not
from
above
but
is
earthly
sensual
you
avoid
the
very
point
of
the
argument
which
is
is
this
a
sin
against
god
that
it
is
i
am
solemnly
convinced
and
shall
i
use
lightness
or
the
things
that
i
purpose
do
i
purpose
according
to
the
flesh
that
with
me
there
should
be
yea
yea
and
nay
nay
no
brown
immediate
repentance
unconditional
submission
these
are
what
i
must
preach
as
long
as
god
gives
me
a
pulpit
to
stand
in
whether
men
will
hear
or
whether
they
will
well
doctor
said
simeon
shortly
you
can
do
as
you
like
but
i
give
you
fair
warning
that
i
for
one
shall
stop
my
subscription
and
go
to
stiles
s
mr
brown
said
the
doctor
solemnly
rising
and
drawing
his
tall
figure
to
its
full
height
while
a
vivid
light
gleamed
from
his
blue
eye
as
to
that
you
can
do
as
you
like
but
i
think
it
my
duty
as
your
pastor
to
warn
you
that
i
have
perceived
in
my
conversation
with
you
this
morning
such
a
want
of
true
spiritual
illumination
and
discernment
as
leads
me
to
believe
that
you
are
yet
in
the
flesh
blinded
by
that
carnal
mind
which
is
not
subject
to
the
law
of
god
neither
indeed
can
i
much
fear
you
have
no
part
nor
lot
in
this
matter
and
that
you
have
need
seriously
to
set
yourself
to
search
into
the
foundations
of
your
hope
for
you
may
be
like
him
of
whom
it
is
written
isaiah
xliv
he
feedeth
on
ashes
a
deceived
heart
hath
turned
him
aside
that
he
can
not
deliver
his
soul
nor
say
is
there
not
a
lie
in
my
right
hand
the
doctor
delivered
this
address
to
his
man
of
influence
with
the
calmness
of
an
ambassador
charged
with
a
message
from
a
sovereign
for
which
he
is
no
otherwise
responsible
than
to
speak
it
in
the
most
intelligible
manner
and
then
taking
up
his
hat
and
cane
he
bade
him
good
morning
leaving
simeon

in
a
tumult
of
excitement
which
no
previous
theological
discussion
had
ever
raised

already

when
the

of

appeared
at

stood
with
a
pleased
quiet
welcome
in

soft
brown

drove
sitting
on

the
doctor
apparelled
in
the
most
faultless
style
with
white
plaited
immaculate
wig
and
coat
sat
by
mary
s
side
serenely
unconscious
how
many
feminine
cares
had
gone
to
his
he
did
not
know
of
the
privy
consultations
the
sewings
stitchings
and
starchings
the
ironings
the
brushings
the
foldings
and
unfoldings
and
timely
arrangements
that
gave
such
dignity
and
respectability
to
his
outer
man

more
than
the

tranquilly
behind

it

thinks
not
how
or
why
there
is
a
vast
amount
of
latent
gratitude
to
women
lying
undeveloped
in
the
hearts
of
men
which
would
come
out
plentifully
if
they
only
knew
what
they
did
for
them
the
doctor
was
so
used
to
being
well
dressed
that
he
never
asked
why
that
his
wig
always
sat
straight
and
even
around
his
ample
forehead
not
facetiously
poked
to
one
side
nor
assuming
rakish
airs
unsuited
to
clerical
dignity
was
entirely
owing
to
katy
scudder
that
his
best
broadcloth
coat
was
not
illustrated
with
shreds
and
patches
fluff
and
dust
and
hanging
in
ungainly
folds
was
owing
to
the
same
that
his
long
silk
stockings
never
had
a
treacherous
stitch
allowed
to
break
out
into
a
long
running
ladder
was
due
to
her
watchfulness
and
that
he
wore
spotless
ruffles
on
his
wrists
or
at
his
bosom
was
her
doing
also
the
doctor
little
thought
while
he
in
common
with
good
ministers
generally
gently
traduced
the
scriptural
martha
and
insisted
on
the
duty
of
heavenly
abstractedness
how
much
of
his
own
leisure
for
spiritual
contemplation
was
due
to
the
talents
of
his
hostess
but
then
the
good
soul
had
it
in
him
to
be
grateful
and
would
have
been
unboundedly
so
if
he
had
known
his
indebtedness

trust
most
of
our
magnanimous
masters
would
be
zebedee
marvyn
was
quietly
sitting
in
the
front
summer
parlour
listening
to
the
story
of
two
of
his
brother
between
whom
some
difficulty
had
arisen
in
the
settling
of
accounts
jim
bigelow
a
small
dry
dapper
little
individual
known
as
general
jobber
and
factotum
and
abram
griswold
a
stolid
wealthy
farmer
and
the
fragments
of
conversation
we
catch
are
not
uninteresting
as
showing
zebedee
s
habits
of
thought
and
mode
of
treating
those
who
came
to
him
for
advice
i
could
ave
got
along
better
if
he
d
a
paid
me
regular
every
night
said
the
squeaky
voice
of
little
jim
but
he
was
allers
puttin
me
off
till
it
come
even
change
he
well
t
aint
always
handy
replied
the
other
one
doesn
t
like
to
break
into
a
note
for
nothing
and
i
like
to
let
it
run
till
it
comes
even
but
brother
said
zebedee
turning
over
the
great
bible
that
lay
on
the
mahogany
stand
in
the
corner
we
must
go
to
the
law
and
to
the
testimony
turning
over
the
leaves
he
read
from
deuteronomy
xxiv
thou
shalt
not
oppress
an
hired
servant
that
is
poor
and
needy
whether
he
be
of
thy
brethren
or
of
thy
strangers
that
are
in
thy
land
within
thy
gates
at
his
day
thou
shalt
give
him
his
hire
neither
shall
the
sun
go
down
upon
it
for
he
is
poor
and
setteth
his
heart
upon
it
lest
he
cry
against
thee
unto
the
lord
and
it
be
sin
unto
you
see
what
the
bible
has
to
say
on
the
matter
he
said
well
now
deacon
i
rather
think
you
ve
got
me
in
a
tight
place
said
griswold
rising
and
turning
confusedly
round
he
saw
the
placid
figure
of
the
doctor
who
had
entered
the
room
unobserved
in
the
midst
of
the
conversation
and
was
staring
with
that
look
of
calm
dreamy
abstraction
which
often
led
people
to
suppose
that
he
heard
and
saw
nothing
of
what
was
going
forward
all
rose
reverently
and
while
zebedee
was
shaking
hands
with
the
doctor
and
welcoming
him
to
his
house
the
other
two
silently
withdrew
making
respectful
obeisance
marvyn
had
drawn
mary
s
hand
gently
under
her
arm
and
taken
her
to
her
own
as
it
was
her
general
habit
to
do
that
she
might
show
her
the
last
book
she
had
been
reading
and
pour
into
her
ear
the
thoughts
that
had
been
kindled
up
by
it
scudder
after
carefully
brushing
every
speck
of
dust
from
the
doctor
s
coat
and
seeing
him
seated
in
an
by
the
open
window
took
out
a
long
stocking
of
yarn
which
she
was
knitting
for
his
and
pinning
her
on
her
side
was
soon
trotting
her
needles
contentedly
in
front
of
him
the
of
the
doctor
s
morning
attempt
at
enforcing
his
theology
in
practice
rather
depressed
his
spirits
there
was
a
noble
innocence
of
nature
in
him
which
looked
at
hypocrisy
with
a
puzzled
and
incredulous
astonishment
how
a
man
do
so
and
be
so
was
to
him
a
problem
at
which
his
thoughts
vainly
laboured
not
that
he
was
in
the
least
discouraged
or
hesitating
in
regard
to
his
own
course
when
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
perform
a
duty
the
question
of
success
no
more
entered
his
thoughts
than
those
of
the
granite
boulder
to
which
we
have
before
compared
him
when
the
time
came
for
him
to
roll
he
did
roll
with
the
whole
force
of
his
being
he
was
to
land
was
not
his
concern
mildly
and
placidly
he
sat
with
his
hands
resting
on
his
knees
while
zebedee
and
scudder
compared
notes
respecting
the
relative
prospects
of
corn
flax
and
buckwheat
and
thence
passed
to
the
doings
of
congress
and
the
last
proclamation
of
general
washington
pausing
once
in
a
while
if
peradventure
the
doctor
might
take
up
the
conversation
still
he
sat
dreamily
eyeing
the
flies
as
they
fizzed
down
the
panes
of
the
window
i
think
said
zebedee
the
prospects
of
the
federal
party
were
never
the
doctor
was
a
stanch
federalist
and
generally
warmed
to
this
allurement
but
it
did
not
serve
this
time
suddenly
drawing
himself
up
a
light
came
into
his
blue
eyes
and
he
said
to
marvyn
i
m
thinking
deacon
if
it
is
wrong
to
keep
back
the
wages
of
a
servant
till
after
the
going
down
of
the
sun
what
those
are
to
do
who
keep
them
back
all
their
there
was
a
way
the
doctor
had
of
hearing
and
seeing
when
he
looked
as
if
his
soul
were
afar
off
and
bringing
suddenly
into
present
conversation
some
fragment
of
the
past
on
which
he
had
been
leisurely
hammering
in
the
quiet
chambers
of
his
brain
which
was
sometimes
quite
startling
this
allusion
to
a
passage
of
scripture
which
marvyn
was
reading
when
he
came
in
and
which
nobody
supposed
he
had
attended
to
startled
scudder
who
thought
mentally
now
for
it
and
laid
down
her
and
eyed
her
cousin
anxiously
marvyn
and
mary
who
had
glided
in
and
joined
the
circle
looking
interested
and
a
slight
flush
rose
and
overspread
the
thin
cheeks
of
marvyn
and
his
blue
eyes
deepened
in
a
moment
with
a
thoughtful
shadow
as
he
looked
inquiringly
at
the
doctor
who
proceeded
my
mind
labours
with
this
subject
of
the
enslaving
of
the
africans
marvyn
we
have
just
been
declaring
to
the
world
that
all
men
are
born
with
an
inalienable
right
to
liberty
we
have
fought
for
it
and
the
lord
of
hosts
has
been
with
us
and
can
we
stand
before
him
with
our
foot
upon
our
brother
s
neck
a
generous
upright
nature
is
always
more
sensitive
to
blame
than
another
in
proportion
to
the
amount
of
its
reverence
for
good
marvyn
s
face
flushed
his
eye
kindled
and
his
compressed
respiration
showed
how
deeply
the
subject
moved
him
marvyn
s
eyes
turned
on
him
an
anxious
look
of
inquiry
he
answered
however
calmly
doctor
i
have
thought
of
the
subject
myself
marvyn
has
lately
been
reading
a
pamphlet
of
thomas
clarkson
s
on
the
and
she
was
saying
to
me
only
last
night
that
she
did
not
see
but
the
argument
extended
equally
to
holding
slaves
one
thing
i
confess
stumbles
me
there
not
an
express
permission
given
to
israel
to
buy
and
hold
slaves
of
old
doubtless
said
the
doctor
but
many
permissions
were
given
to
them
which
were
local
and
temporary
for
if
we
hold
them
to
apply
to
the
human
race
the
turks
might
quote
the
bible
for
making
slaves
of
us
if
they
could
the
algerines
have
the
scripture
all
on
their
side
our
own
blacks
at
some
future
time
if
they
can
get
the
power
might
justify
themselves
in
making
slaves
of
i
assure
you
sir
said
marvyn
if
i
speak
it
is
not
to
excuse
myself
but
i
am
quite
sure
my
servants
do
not
desire
liberty
and
would
not
take
it
if
it
were
call
them
in
and
try
it
said
the
doctor
if
they
refuse
it
is
their
own
there
was
a
gentle
movement
in
the
group
at
the
directness
of
this
personal
application
but
marvyn
replied
calmly
cato
is
up
at
the
lot
but
you
may
call
in
candace
my
dear
call
candace
and
let
the
doctor
put
the
question
to
candace
was
at
this
moment
sitting
before
the
ample
fireplace
in
the
kitchen
with
two
iron
kettles
before
her
nestled
each
in
its
bed
of
hickory
coals
which
gleamed
out
from
their
white
ashes
like
sleepy
red
eyes
opening
and
shutting
in
one
was
coffee
which
she
was
burning
stirring
vigorously
with
a
in
the
other
puffy
in
shapes
of
rings
hearts
and
marvellous
twists
which
candace
had
such
a
special
proclivity
for
making
that
marvyn
s
table
and
closets
never
knew
an
intermission
of
their
presence
candace
the
doctor
wishes
to
see
you
said
marvyn
bress
his
heart
said
candace
looking
up
perplexed
wants
to

added
in

patronising
tone
missis

a
few
moments
after
candace
joined
the
group
in
the
having
hastily
tied
a
clean
white
apron
over
her
blue
linsey
and
donned
the
brilliant
madras
which
james
had
lately
given
her
and
which
she
had
a
barbaric
fashion
of
arranging
so
as
to
give
to
her
head
the
air
of
a
gigantic
butterfly
she
sunk
a
dutiful
curtsy
and
stood
twirling
her
thumbs
while
the
doctor
surveyed
her
gravely
candace
said
he
do
you
think
it
right
that
the
black
race
should
be
slaves
to
the
white
the
face
and
air
of
candace
presented
a
curious
picture
at
this
moment
a
sort
of
rude
sense
of
delicacy
embarrassed
her
and
she
turned
a
deprecating
look
first
on
marvyn
and
then
on
her
master
don
t
mind
us
candace
said
marvyn
tell
the
doctor
the
exact
candace
stood
still
a
moment
and
the
spectators
saw
a
deeper
shadow
roll
over
her
sable
face
like
a
cloud
over
a
dark
pool
of
water
and
her
immense
person
heaved
with
her
laboured

said
marvyn
solemnly
candace
covered
her
face
with
both
her
fat
hands
and
shook
and
trembled
and
finally
throwing
her
apron
over
her
head
made
a
desperate
rush
for
the
door
and
threw
herself
down
in
the
kitchen
in
a
perfect
tropical
torrent
of
tears
and
sobs

the
doctor

ef

here
alluded
to
some
of
the
little
private
wilfulnesses
which
she
had
always
obstinately
cherished
as
reserved
rights
in
pursuing
domestic
matters
with
her
mistress
i

said
marvyn
to
make
the
same
offer
to
your

when
he

he

do
jes
as
i
do
a
n
t
no

o

o
askin
him
course
he
a
smile
passed
round
the
circle
because
between
candace
and
her
husband
there
existed
one
of
those
whimsical
contrasts
which
one
sometimes
sees
in
married
life
cato
was
a
thin
negro
addicted
to
a
gentle
chronic
cough
and
though
a
faithful
and
skilful
servant
seemed
in
relation
to
his
better
half
much
like
a
hill
of
potatoes
under
a
spreading
candace
held
to
him
with
a
vehement
and
patronizing
fondness
so
devoid
of
conjugal
reverence
as
to
excite
the
comments
of
her
friends
you
must
remember
candace
said
a
good
deacon
to
her
one
day
when
she
was
ordering
him
about
at
a
catechizing
you
ought
to
give
honour
to
your
husband
the
wife
is
the
weaker
de
weaker
vessel
said
candace
looking
down
from
the
tower
of
her
ample
corpulence
on
the
small
quiet
man
whom
she
had
been
fledging
with
the
ample
folds
of
a
worsted
comforter
out
of
which
his
little
head
and
shining
looked
much
like
a
blackbird
in
a
nest
de
weaker
vessel
umph
a
convention
could
not
have
expressed
more
in
a
day
than
was
given
in
that
single
look
and
word
candace
considered
a
husband
as
a
thing
to
be
taken
care
of
rather
inconsequent
and
somewhat
troublesome
species
of
pet
to
be
humoured
nursed
fed
clothed
and
guided
in
the
way
that
he
was
to
go
animal
that
was
always
losing
of
buttons
catching
colds
wearing
his
best
coat
every
day
and
getting
on
his
sunday
hat
in
a
surreptitious
manner
for
occasions
but
she
often
condescended
to
express
it
as
her
opinion
that
he
was
a
blessing
and
that
she
didn
t
know
what
she
should
do
if
it
wasn
t
for
cato
in
fact
he
seemed
to
supply
her
that
which
we
are
told
is
the
great
want
in
woman
s
situation
object
in
life
she
sometimes
was
heard
expressing
herself
very
energetically
in
disapprobation
of
the
conduct
of
one
of
her
sable
friends
named
jinny
stiles
who
after
being
presented
with
her
own
freedom
worked
several
years
to
buy
that
of
her
husband
but
became
afterwards
so
disgusted
with
her
acquisition
that
she
declared
she
would
neber
buy
anoder
now
jinny
don
t
know
what
she
s
talkin
about
she
would
say

and
keep

and
candace
after
this
condescending
remark
would
lift
off
with
one
hand
a
brass
kettle
in
which
poor
cato
might
have
been
drowned
and
fly
across
the
kitchen
with
it

chapter
xii
miss
prissy
will
our
little
mary
really
fall
in
love
with
the
doctor
question
reaches
us
in
anxious
tones
from
all
the
circle
of
our
readers
and
what
especially
shocks
us
is
that
grave
doctors
of
divinity
and
serious
matrons
seem
to
be
the
class
who
are
particularly
set
against
the
success
of
our
excellent
orthodox
hero
and
bent
on
reminding
us
of
the
claims
of
that
unregenerate
james
whom
we
have
sent
to
sea
on
purpose
that
our
heroine
may
recover
herself
of
that
foolish
partiality
for
him
which
all
the
christian
world
seems
bent
on
perpetuating
now
really
says
the
rev
looking
up
from
her
bundle
of
work
you
are
going
to
let
mary
marry
the
doctor
my
dear
madam
is
not
that
just
what
you
did
yourself
after
having
turned
off
three
or
four
fascinating
young
sinners
as
good
as
james
any
day
don
t
make
us
believe
that
you
are
sorry
for
it
now
is
it
possible
says
theophrastus
who
is
himself
a
stanch
hopkinsian
divine
and
who
is
at
present
recovering
from
his
last
grand
effort
on
natural
and
moral
ability
is
it
possible
that
you
are
going
to
let
mary
forget
that
poor
young
man
and
marry
that
will
never
do
in
the
world
dear
doctor
consider
what
would
have
become
of
you
if
some
lady
at
a
certain
time
had
not
had
the
sense
and
discernment
to
fall
in
love
with
the
who
came
to
her
disguised
as
a
theologian
but
he
s
so
old
says
aunt
maria
not
at
all
old
what
do
you
mean
forty
is
the
very
season
of
ripeness
very
meridian
of
manly
lustre
and
splendour
but
he
wears
a
my
dear
madam
so
did
sir
charles
grandison
and
lovelace
and
all
the
other
fine
fellows
of
those
days
the
wig
was
the
distinguishing
mark
of
a
gentleman
no
of
all
you
may
say
and
declare
we
do
insist
that
our
doctor
is
a
very
proper
and
probable
subject
for
a
young
lady
to
fall
in
love
with
if
women
have
one
weakness
more
marked
than
another
it
is
towards
veneration
they
are
born
worshippers
of
silver
shrines
for
some
divinity
or
other
which
of
course
they
always
think
fell
straight
down
from
heaven
the
first
step
towards
their
falling
in
love
with
an
ordinary
mortal
is
generally
to
dress
him
out
with
all
manner
of
real
or
fancied
superiority
and
having
made
him
up
they
worship
him
now
a
truly
great
man
a
man
really
grand
and
noble
in
heart
and
intellect
has
this
advantage
with
women
that
he
is
an
idol
to
hand
and
so
that
very
painstaking
and
ingenious
sex
have
less
labour
in
getting
him
up
and
can
be
ready
to
worship
him
on
shorter
notice
in
particular
is
this
the
case
where
a
sacred
profession
and
a
moral
supremacy
are
added
to
the
intellectual
just
think
of
the
career
of
celebrated
preachers
and
divines
in
all
ages
have
they
not
stood
like
the
image
that
nebuchadnezzar
the
king
set
up
and
all
womankind
coquettes
and
flirts
not
excepted
been
ready
to
fall
down
and
worship
even
before
the
sound
of
cornet
flute
harp
sackbut
and
so
forth
is
not
the
faithful
paula
with
her
beautiful
face
prostrate
in
reverence
before
poor
old
lean
haggard
dying
jerome
in
the
most
splendid
painting
of
the
world
an
emblem
and
sign
of
woman
s
eternal
power
of
to
what
she
deems
noblest
in
man
does
not
old
richard
baxter
tell
us
with
delightful
how
his
wife
fell
in
love
with
him
first
spite
of
his
long
pale
face
how
she
confessed
dear
soul
after
many
years
of
married
life
that
she
had
found
him
sour
and
bitter
than
she
had
expected
the
fact
is
women
are
burdened
with
fealty
faith
reverence
more
than
they
know
what
to
do
with
they
stand
like
a
hedge
of
throwing
out
fluttering
tendrils
everywhere
for
something
high
and
strong
to
climb
by
when
they
find
it
be
it
ever
so
rough
in
the
bark
they
catch
upon
it
and
instances
are
not
wanting
of
those
who
have
turned
away
from
the
flattery
of
admirers
to
prostrate
themselves
at
the
feet
of
a
genuine
hero
who
never
wooed
them
except
by
heroic
deeds
and
the
rhetoric
of
a
noble
life
never
was
there
a
distinguished
man
whose
greatness
could
sustain
the
test
of
minute
domestic
inspection
better
than
our
doctor
strong
in
a
humility
a
perfect
unconsciousness
of
self
an
honest
and
sincere
absorption
in
high
and
holy
themes
and
objects
there
was
in
him
what
we
so
seldom
see
perfect
logic
of
life
his
minutest
deeds
were
the
true
results
of
his
sublimest
principles
his
whole
nature
moral
physical
and
intellectual
was
simple
pure
and
cleanly
he
was
temperate
as
an
anchorite
in
all
matters
of
living
from
a
healthy
instinct
all
those
intoxicating
stimuli
then
common
among
the
clergy
in
his
early
youth
indeed
he
had
formed
an
attachment
to
the
almost
universal
clerical
pipe
observing
a
delicate
woman
once
nauseated
by
coming
into
the
atmosphere
which
he
and
his
brethren
had
polluted
he
set
himself
gravely
to
reflect
that
that
which
could
so
offend
a
woman
must
needs
be
uncomely
and
unworthy
a
christian
man
wherefore
he
laid
his
pipe
on
the
mantelpiece
and
never
afterwards
resumed
the
indulgence
in
all
his
relations
with
womanhood
he
was
delicate
and
reverential
forming
his
manners
by
that
old
precept
the
elder
women
entreat
as
mothers
the
younger
as
sisters
rule
short
and
simple
as
it
is
is
nevertheless
the
most
perfect
of
all
true
gentlemanliness
then
as
for
person
the
doctor
was
not
handsome
to
be
sure
but
he
was
what
sometimes
serves
with
woman
better
and
manly
and
when
animated
by
thought
and
feeling
having
even
a
commanding
grandeur
of
mien
add
to
all
this
that
our
valiant
hero
is
now
on
the
straight
road
to
bring
him
into
that
situation
most
likely
to
engage
the
warm
partisanship
of
a
true
woman
that
of
a
man
unjustly
abused
for
one
may
see
that
it
is
ten
to
one
our
mary
may
fall
in
love
with
him
yet
before
she
knows
it
if
it
were
not
for
this
mysterious
which
makes
this
wild
wandering
uncanonical
sailor
james
marvyn
so
intimate
and
internal
his
thread
were
not
knit
up
with
the
thread
of
her
life
it
not
for
the
old
habit
of
feeling
for
him
thinking
for
him
praying
for
him
hoping
for
him
fearing
for
him
is
us
the
unfortunate
habit
of
womankind
it
were
not
for
that
fatal
something
which
neither
judgment
nor
wishes
nor
reason
nor
common
sense
shows
any
great
skill
in
unravelling
are
quite
sure
that
mary
would
be
in
love
with
the
doctor
within
the
next
six
months
as
it
is
we
leave
you
all
to
infer
from
your
own
heart
and
consciousness
what
his
chances
are
a
new
sort
of
scene
is
about
to
open
on
our
heroine
and
we
shall
show
her
to
you
for
an
evening
at
least
in
new
associations
and
with
a
different
background
from
that
homely
and
rural
one
in
which
she
has
fluttered
as
a
white
dove
amid
leafy
and
congenial
surroundings
as
we
have
before
intimated
newport
presented
a
of
many
different
phases
of
society
all
brought
upon
a
social
level
by
the
then
universally
admitted
principle
of
equality
there
were
scattered
about
in
the
settlement
lordly
mansions
whose
owners
rolled
in
emblazoned
carriages
and
whose
wide
halls
were
the
scenes
of
a
showy
and
almost
princely
hospitality
by
her
husband
s
side
katy
scudder
was
allied
to
one
of
these
families
of
wealthy
planters
and
often
recognized
the
connection
with
a
quiet
undertone
of
satisfaction
as
a
dignified
and
woman
should
she
liked
once
in
a
while
quietly
to
let
people
know
that
although
they
lived
in
the
plain
little
cottage
and
made
no
pretensions
yet
they
had
good
blood
in
their
veins
scudder
s
mother
was
a
wilcox
and
that
the
wilcoxes
were
she
supposed
as
high
as
anybody
ending
the
remark
with
the
observation
that
all
these
things
to
be
sure
were
matters
of
small
consequence
since
at
last
it
would
be
of
far
more
importance
to
have
been
a
true
christian
than
to
have
been
connected
with
the
highest
families
of
the
nevertheless
scudder
was
not
a
little
pleased
to
have
in
her
possession
a
card
of
invitation
to
a
splendid
that
was
going
to
be
given
on
friday
at
the
wilcox
manor
she
thought
it
a
very
becoming
mark
of
respect
to
the
deceased
scudder
that
his
widow
and
daughter
should
be
brought
to
mind
becoming
and
praiseworthy
in
fact
that
though
an
old
woman
as
she
said
with
a
complacent
straightening
of
her
tall
lithe
figure
she
really
thought
she
must
make
an
effort
to
go
accordingly
early
one
morning
after
all
domestic
duties
had
been
fulfilled
and
the
clock
loudly
ticking
through
the
empty
rooms
told
that
all
needful
bustle
had
died
down
to
silence
katy
mary
and
miss
prissy
diamond
the
dressmaker
might
have
been
observed
sitting
in
solemn
senate
around
the
trunk
before
spoken
of
and
which
exhaled
vague
foreign
and
indian
perfumes
of
silk
and
sandalwood
you
may
have
heard
of
dignitaries
my
good
reader
i
assure
you
you
know
very
little
of
a
situation
of
trust
or
importance
compared
to
that
of
dressmaker
in
a
small
new
england
town
what
important
interests
does
she
hold
in
her
hands
how
is
she
besieged
courted
deferred
to
three
months
beforehand
all
her
days
and
nights
are
spoken
for
and
the
simple
statement
that
on
that
day
you
can
have
miss
clippers
is
of
itself
an
apology
for
any
omission
of
attention
elsewhere
strikes
home
at
once
to
the
deepest
consciousness
of
every
woman
married
or
single
how
thoughtfully
is
everything
arranged
weeks
beforehand
for
the
golden
important
season
when
miss
clippers
can
come
on
that
day
there
is
to
be
no
extra
sweeping
dusting
cleaning
cooking
no
visiting
no
receiving
no
reading
or
writing
but
all
with
one
heart
and
soul
are
to
wait
upon
her
intent
to
forward
the
great
work
which
she
graciously
affords
a
day
s
leisure
to
direct
seated
in
her
chair
of
state
with
her
cushion
bristling
with
pins
and
needles
at
her
side
her
ready
roll
of
patterns
and
her
scissors
she
hears
judges
and
decides
on
the
possible
or
not
possible
in
that
important
art
on
which
depends
the
right
presentation
of
the
floral
part
of
nature
s
great
horticultural
show
she
alone
is
competent
to
say
whether
there
is
any
available
remedy
for
the
stained
breadth
in
jane
s
the
fatal
spot
by
any
magical
can
be
cut
out
from
the
fulness
or
turned
up
and
smothered
from
view
in
the
gathers
or
concealed
by
some
new
fashion
of
trimming
falling
with
generous
appropriateness
exactly
across
the
fatal
weak
point
she
can
tell
you
whether
that
remnant
of
velvet
will
make
you
a
basque
mamma
s
old
silk
can
reappear
in
juvenile
grace
for
miss
lucy
what
marvels
follow
her
wherever
she
goes
what
wonderful
results
does
she
contrive
from
the
most
unlikely
materials
as
everybody
after
her
departure
wonders
to
see
old
things
become
so
much
better
than
new
among
the
most
influential
and
happy
of
her
class
was
miss
prissy
diamond
little
dapper
body
quick
in
her
motions
and
nimble
in
her
tongue
whose
delicate
complexion
flaxen
curls
merry
flow
of
spirits
and
ready
abundance
of
gaiety
song
and
story
apart
from
her
professional
accomplishments
made
her
a
welcome
guest
in
every
family
in
the
neighbourhood
miss
prissy
laughingly
boasted
being
past
forty
sure
that
the
avowal
would
always
draw
down
on
her
quite
a
storm
of
compliments
on
the
freshness
of
her
complexion
and
the
brightness
of
her
merry
blue
eyes
she
was
well
pleased
to
hear
dawning
girls
wondering
why
with
so
many
advantages
she
had
never
married
at
such
remarks
miss
prissy
always
laughed
loudly
and
declared
that
she
had
always
had
such
a
string
of
engagements
with
the
women
that
she
never
found
half
an
hour
to
listen
to
what
any
living
would
say
to
her
supposing
she
could
stop
to
hear
him
besides
if
i
were
to
get
married
nobody
else
could
she
would
say
what
would
become
of
all
the
for
everybody
else
but
sometimes
when
miss
prissy
felt
extremely
gracious
she
would
draw
out
of
her
little
chest
just
the
faintest
of
a
sigh
and
tell
some
young
lady
in
a
confidential
undertone
that
one
of
these
days
she
would
tell
her
something
then
there
would
come
a
wink
of
her
blue
eyes
and
a
fluttering
of
the
pink
ribbons
in
her
cap
quite
stimulating
to
youthful
inquisitiveness
though
we
have
never
been
able
to
learn
by
any
of
our
antiquarian
researches
that
the
expectations
thus
excited
were
ever
gratified
in
her
professional
prowess
she
felt
a
pardonable
pride
what
feats
could
she
relate
of
wonderful
dresses
got
out
of
impossibly
small
patterns
of
silk
what
marvels
of
silks
turned
that
could
not
be
told
from
new
what
reclaimings
of
waists
that
other
dressmakers
had
hopelessly
spoiled
had
not
general
wilcox
once
been
obliged
to
call
in
her
aid
on
a
dress
sent
to
her
from
paris
and
did
not
miss
prissy
work
three
days
and
nights
on
that
dress
and
make
every
stitch
of
that
trimming
over
with
her
own
hands
before
it
was
fit
to
be
seen
and
when
mrs
governor
dexter
s
best
brocade
was
spoiled
by
miss
pimlico
and
there
wasn
t
another
scrap
to
pattern
it
with
didn
t
she
make
a
new
waist
out
of
the
cape
and
piece
one
of
the
sleeves
times
and
yet
nobody
would
ever
have
known
that
there
was
a
joining
in
it
in
fact
though
miss
prissy
enjoyed
the
fair
average
of
her
work
she
might
be
said
to
in
difficulties
a
full
pattern
with
trimming
all
ample
and
ready
awoke
a
moderate
enjoyment
but
the
resurrection
of
anything
or
imperfectly
made
the
brilliant
success
when
after
turning
twisting
piecing
contriving
and
by
inventions
of
trimming
a
dress
faded
and
defaced
was
restored
to
more
than
pristine
splendour
was
a
triumph
worth
enjoying
it
was
true
miss
prissy
like
most
of
her
nomadic
compeers
was
a
little
given
to
gossip
but
after
all
it
was
innocent
gossip
a
bit
of
malice
in
it
it
was
only
all
the
particulars
about
s
wardrobe
the
statistics
of
other
s
the
minute
items
of
miss
simpkins
s
how
her
mother
cried
the
morning
of
the
wedding
and
said
that
she
didn
t
know
anything
how
she
could
spare
louisa
jane
only
that
edward
was
such
a
good
boy
that
she
felt
she
could
love
him
like
an
own
son
what
a
providence
it
seemed
that
the
very
ring
that
was
put
into
the
was
one
that
he
gave
her
when
he
first
went
to
sea
when
she
wouldn
t
be
engaged
to
him
because
she
thought
she
loved
thomas
strickland
better
but
that
was
only
because
she
hadn
t
found
him
out
you
know
so
forth
and
so
forth
sometimes
too
her
narrations
assumed
a
solemn
cast
and
brought
to
mind
the
hush
of
funerals
and
told
of
words
spoken
in
faint
whispers
when
hands
were
clasped
for
the
last
time
of
utterances
crushed
out
from
hearts
when
the
hammer
of
a
great
sorrow
strikes
out
sparks
of
the
divine
even
from
common
stone
and
there
would
be
real
tears
in
the
little
blue
eyes
and
the
pink
bows
would
flutter
tremulously
like
the
last
three
leaves
on
a
bare
scarlet
maple
in
autumn
in
fact
dear
reader
like
romance
has
its
noble
side
to
it
how
can
you
love
your
neighbour
as
yourself
and
not
feel
a
little
curiosity
as
to
how
he
fares
what
he
wears
where
he
goes
and
how
he
takes
the
great
life
at
which
you
and
he
are
both
more
than
spectators
show
me
a
person
who
lives
in
a
absolutely
without
curiosity
or
interest
on
these
subjects
and
i
will
show
you
a
cold
fat
oyster
to
whom
the
of
propriety
is
the
whole
of
existence
as
one
of
our
esteemed
collaborators
remarks
a
dull
town
where
there
is
neither
theatre
nor
circus
nor
opera
must
have
some
excitement
and
the
real
tragedy
and
comedy
of
life
come
in
place
of
the
hence
the
noted
gossiping
propensities
of
which
so
long
as
they
are
not
poisoned
by
envy
or
have
a
respectable
and
picturesque
side
to
them
undoubted
leave
to
be
as
probably
has
almost
everything
which
obstinately
and
always
insists
on
being
except
sin
as
it
is
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
arrival
of
miss
prissy
in
a
family
was
much
like
the
setting
up
of
a
domestic
showcase
through
which
you
could
look
into
all
the
families
in
the
neighbourhood
and
see
the
drama
of
life
marriages
deaths
of
mothers
whose
babes
weighed
just
eight
pounds
and
three
quarters
and
had
hair
that
would
part
with
a
comb
tears
of
rachels
who
wept
for
their
children
and
would
not
be
comforted
because
they
were
not
was
there
a
tragedy
a
mystery
in
all
newport
whose
secret
closet
had
not
been
unlocked
by
miss
prissy
she
thought
not
and
you
always
wondered
with
an
uncertain
curiosity
what
those
things
might
be
over
which
she
gravely
shook
her
head
declaring
with
such
a
look
oh
if
you
only
know
ending
with
a
general
sigh
and
lamentation
like
the
confidential
chorus
of
a
greek
tragedy
we
have
been
thus
minute
in
sketching
miss
prissy
s
portrait
because
we
rather
like
her
she
has
great
power
we
admit
and
were
she
a
angular
energetic
body
with
a
heart
whose
secretions
had
all
become
acrid
by
disappointment
and
dyspepsia
she
might
be
a
fearful
gnome
against
whose
family
visitations
one
ought
to
watch
and
pray
as
it
was
she
came
into
the
house
rather
like
one
of
those
breezy
days
of
spring
which
burst
all
the
blossoms
set
all
the
doors
and
windows
open
make
the
hens
cackle
and
the
turtles
peep
a
solemn
puritan
dwelling
with
as
much
bustle
and
chatter
as
if
a
box
of
martins
were
setting
up
housekeeping
in
it
let
us
now
introduce
you
to
the
sanctuary
of
scudder
s
own
private
bedroom
where
the
committee
of
exigencies
with
miss
prissy
at
their
head
are
seated
in
solemn
session
around
the
trunk
dress
you
know
is
of
importance
after
all
said
scudder
in
that
apologetic
way
in
which
sensible
people
generally
acknowledge
a
secret
leaning
towards
anything
so
very
mundane
while
the
good
lady
spoke
she
was
reverentially
unpinning
and
shaking
out
of
their
fragrant
folds
creamy
crape
shawls
of
rich
chinese
embroidery
muslin
scarfs
and
aprons
and
already
her
hands
were
undoing
the
pins
of
a
silvery
damask
linen
in
which
was
wrapped
her
own
i
have
always
told
mary
she
continued
that
though
our
hearts
ought
not
to
be
set
on
these
things
yet
they
had
their
certainly
certainly
ma
am
chimed
in
miss
prissy
i
was
saying
to
miss
general
wilcox
the
other
day
didn
t
see
how
we
could
consider
the
lilies
of
the
field
without
seeing
the
importance
of
looking
pretty
i
ve
got
a
in
my
garden
now
from
one
of
the
new
roots
that
old
major
seaforth
brought
over
from
france
which
is
just
the
most
beautiful
thing
you
ever
did
see
and
i
was
thinking
as
i
looked
at
it
that
if
women
s
dresses
only
grew
on
em
as
handsome
and
as
that
why
there
wouldn
t
be
any
need
of
me
but
as
it
is
why
we
if
we
want
to
look
well
now
i
s
pose
might
bear
just
as
good
peaches
without
the
pink
blows
but
then
who
would
want
em
to
miss
deacon
twitchel
when
i
was
up
there
the
other
day
kept
kind
o
sighin
cause
cerintha
ann
is
getting
a
new
pink
silk
made
up
cause
she
said
it
was
such
a
dying
world
it
didn
t
seem
right
to
call
off
our
attention
but
i
told
her
it
wasn
t
any
pinker
than
the
and
what
with
robins
and
and
one
thing
or
another
the
lord
is
always
calling
off
our
attention
and
i
think
we
ought
to
observe
the
lord
s
works
and
take
a
lesson
from
yes
you
are
quite
right
said
scudder
rising
and
shaking
out
a
splendid
white
brocade
on
which
bunches
of
were
looped
to
bunches
of
violets
by
graceful
fillets
of
blue
ribbons
this
was
my
she
said
little
miss
prissy
sprang
up
and
clapped
her
hands
in
an
ecstasy
well
now
miss
scudder
really
i
ever
see
anything
more
beautiful
it
really
goes
beyond
anything
ever
saw
i
don
t
think
in
all
the
brocades
i
ever
made
up
i
ever
saw
so
pretty
a
pattern
as
mr
scudder
chose
it
for
me
himself
at
the
in
lyons
said
scudder
with
pardonable
pride
and
i
want
it
tried
on
to
really
miss
scudder
this
ought
to
be
kept
for
said
miss
prissy
as
she
delightedly
bustled
about
the
congenial
task
i
was
up
to
miss
marvyn
s
last
week
she
said
as
she
threw
the
dress
over
mary
s
head
and
she
said
that
james
expected
to
make
his
fortune
in
that
voyage
and
come
home
and
settle
mary
s
fair
head
emerged
from
the
rustling
folds
of
the
brocade
her
cheeks
crimson
as
one
of
the
her
mother
s
face
assumed
a
severe
gravity
as
she
remarked
that
she
believed
james
had
been
much
pleased
with
jane
spencer
and
that
for
her
part
she
should
be
very
glad
when
he
came
home
if
he
could
marry
such
a
steady
sensible
girl
and
settle
down
to
a
useful
christian
life
ah
yes
so
very
excellent
idea
certainly
said
miss
prissy
it
wants
a
little
taken
in
here
on
the
shoulders
and
a
little
under
the
arms
the
biases
are
all
right
the
sleeves
will
want
altering
miss
scudder
i
hope
you
will
have
a
hot
iron
ready
for
scudder
rose
immediately
to
see
the
command
obeyed
and
as
her
back
was
turned
miss
prissy
went
on
in
a
low
tone
now
for
my
part
don
t
think
there
s
a
word
of
truth
in
that
story
about
james
marvyn
and
jane
spencer
for
i
was
down
there
at
work
one
day
when
he
called
and
i
there
couldn
t
have
been
anything
between
them
miss
spencer
her
mother
told
me
there
wasn
t
there
miss
scudder
you
see
that
is
a
good
fit
it
s
astonishing
how
near
it
comes
to
fitting
just
as
it
was
i
didn
t
think
mary
was
so
near
what
you
were
when
you
were
a
girl
miss
scudder
the
other
day
when
i
was
up
to
general
wilcox
s
the
general
he
was
in
the
room
when
i
was
on
miss
wilcox
s
cherry
velvet
and
she
was
asking
couldn
t
i
come
this
week
for
her
and
i
mentioned
i
was
coming
to
miss
scudder
and
the
general
says
he
i
used
to
know
her
when
she
was
a
girl
i
tell
you
she
was
one
of
the
handsomest
girls
in
newport
by
george
says
he
and
says
i
general
you
ought
to
see
her
and
the
general
know
his
jolly
way
laughed
and
says
he
if
she
is
as
handsome
as
her
mother
was
i
don
t
want
to
see
her
says
he
i
tell
you
wife
says
he
i
but
just
missed
falling
in
love
with
katy
i
could
have
told
her
more
than
that
said
scudder
with
a
flash
of
her
old
coquette
girlhood
for
a
moment
lighting
her
eyes
and
straightening
her
lithe
form
i
guess
if
i
should
show
a
letter
he
wrote
me
but
what
am
i
talking
about
she
said
suddenly
stiffening
back
into
a
sensible
woman
miss
prissy
do
you
think
it
will
be
necessary
to
cut
it
off
at
the
bottom
it
seems
a
pity
to
cut
such
rich
so
it
does
i
declare
well
i
believe
it
will
do
to
turn
it
i
depend
on
you
to
put
it
a
little
into
modern
fashion
you
know
said
scudder
it
is
many
a
year
you
know
since
it
was
oh
never
you
fear
you
leave
all
that
to
me
said
miss
prissy
now
there
never
was
anything
so
lucky
as
that
just
before
all
these
had
to
be
fixed
i
got
a
letter
from
my
sister
martha
that
works
for
all
the
first
families
of
boston
and
martha
she
is
really
unusually
privileged
because
she
works
for
miss
cranch
and
miss
cranch
gets
letters
from
miss
adams
know
adams
is
ambassador
now
at
the
court
of
james
and
miss
adams
writes
home
all
the
particulars
about
the
and
martha
she
heard
one
of
the
letters
read
and
she
told
miss
cranch
that
she
would
give
the
best
note
she
had
if
she
could
just
copy
that
description
to
send
to
prissy
well
miss
cranch
let
her
do
it
and
i
ve
got
a
copy
of
the
letter
here
in
my
i
read
it
up
to
miss
general
wilcox
s
and
to
major
seaforth
s
and
i
ll
read
it
to
katy
scudder
was
a
born
subject
of
a
crown
and
though
now
a
republican
matron
had
not
outlived
the
reverence
from
childhood
implanted
for
the
high
and
stately
doings
of
courts
lords
ladies
queens
and
princesses
and
therefore
it
was
not
without
some
awe
that
she
saw
miss
prissy
produce
from
her
little
black
the
epistle
here
it
is
said
miss
prissy
at
last
i
only
copied
out
the
parts
about
being
presented
at
court
she
says
one
is
obliged
here
to
attend
the
circles
of
the
queen
which
are
held
once
a
fortnight
and
what
renders
it
very
expensive
is
that
you
can
not
go
twice
in
the
same
dress
and
a
you
can
not
make
use
of
elsewhere
i
directed
my
to
let
my
dress
be
elegant
but
plain
as
i
could
possibly
appear
with
decency
accordingly
it
is
white
lutestring
covered
and
with
white
crape
festooned
with
lilac
ribbon
and
mock
over
a
hoop
of
enormous
size
there
is
only
a
narrow
train
about
three
yards
in
length
to
the
which
is
put
into
a
ribbon
on
the
left
side
queen
only
having
her
train
borne
ruffled
cuffs
for
married
ladies
lace
ruffles
a
very
dress
cap
with
long
lace
lappets
two
white
plumes
and
a
blonde
lace
handkerchief
this
is
my
miss
prissy
here
stopped
to
adjust
her
spectacles
her
audience
expressed
a
breathless
interest
you
see
she
said
i
used
to
know
her
when
she
was
nabby
smith
she
was
parson
smith
s
daughter
at
weymouth
and
as
handsome
a
girl
as
ever
i
wanted
to
see
as
graceful
as
a
bush
i
don
t
believe
any
of
those
english
ladies
looked
one
bit
better
than
she
did
she
was
always
a
at
writing
everything
she
writes
about
she
puts
it
right
before
you
you
feel
as
if
you
d
been
there
now
here
she
goes
on
to
tell
about
her
daughter
s
dress
she
says
my
head
is
dressed
for
james
s
and
in
my
opinion
looks
very
tasty
whilst
my
daughter
is
undergoing
the
same
operation
i
set
myself
down
composedly
to
write
you
a
few
lines
well
methinks
i
hear
betsy
and
lucy
say
what
is
cousin
s
dress
my
dear
girls
like
your
aunt
s
only
differently
trimmed
and
ornamented
train
being
wholly
of
white
crape
and
trimmed
with
white
ribbon
the
petticoat
which
is
the
most
showy
part
of
the
dress
covered
and
drawn
up
in
what
are
called
festoons
with
light
wreaths
of
beautiful
flowers
the
sleeves
white
crape
drawn
over
the
silk
with
a
row
of
lace
round
the
sleeve
near
the
shoulder
another
down
the
arm
and
a
third
upon
the
top
of
the
ruffle
little
stuck
between
kind
of
with
three
large
feathers
and
a
bunch
of
flowers
wreath
of
flowers
on
the
miss
prissy
concluded
this
relishing
description
with
a
little
smack
of
the
lips
such
as
people
sometimes
give
when
reading
things
that
are
particularly
to
their
taste
now
i
was
she
added
that
it
would
be
an
excellent
way
to
trim
mary
s
sleeves
rows
of
lace
with
a
sprig
to
each
all
this
while
our
mary
with
her
white
and
blue
her
shining
pale
brown
hair
and
serious
large
blue
eyes
sat
innocently
looking
first
at
her
mother
then
at
miss
prissy
and
then
at
the
finery
we
do
not
claim
for
her
any
superhuman
exemption
from
girlish
feelings
she
was
innocently
dazzled
with
the
vision
of
courtly
halls
and
princely
splendours
and
thought
adams
s
descriptions
almost
a
perfect
realization
of
things
she
had
read
in
sir
charles
if
her
mother
thought
it
right
and
proper
she
should
be
dressed
and
made
fine
she
was
glad
of
it
only
there
came
a
heavy
leaden
feeling
in
her
little
heart
which
she
did
not
understand
but
we
who
know
womankind
will
translate
for
you
it
was
that
a
certain
pair
of
dark
eyes
would
not
see
her
after
she
was
dressed
and
so
after
all
what
was
the
use
of
looking
pretty
i
wonder
what
james
think
passed
through
her
head
for
mary
had
never
changed
a
ribbon
or
altered
the
braid
of
her
hair
or
pinned
a
flower
in
her
bosom
that
she
had
not
quickly
seen
the
effect
of
the
change
mirrored
in
those
dark
eyes
it
was
a
pity
of
course
now
she
had
found
out
that
she
ought
not
to
think
about
him
that
so
many
were
twisted
round
him
so
while
miss
prissy
turned
over
her
papers
and
read
out
of
others
extracts
about
lord
caermarthen
and
sir
clement
cotterel
dormer
and
the
princess
royal
and
princess
augusta
in
black
and
silver
with
a
silver
netting
upon
the
coat
and
a
head
stuck
full
of
diamond
pins
lady
salisbury
and
lady
talbot
and
the
duchess
of
devonshire
and
scarlet
satin
sacks
and
diamonds
and
and
the
king
s
kissing
adams
mary
s
blue
eyes
grew
larger
and
larger
seeing
far
off
on
the
salt
green
sea
and
her
ears
heard
only
the
ripple
and
murmur
of
those
waters
that
carried
her
heart
away
miss
prissy
gave
her
a
smart
little
tap
which
awakened
her
to
the
fact
that
she
was
wanted
again
to
try
on
the
dress
which
miss
prissy
s
nimble
fingers
had
basted
so
passed
the
day
prissy
busily
chattering
clipping
basting
patiently
trying
on
to
an
extent
scudder
s
neat
room
whipped
into
a
perfect
froth
and
foam
of
gauze
lace
artificial
flowers
linings
and
other
aids
accessories
and
abetments
at
dinner
the
doctor
who
had
been
all
the
morning
studying
out
his
treatise
on
the
millennium
discoursed
tranquilly
as
usual
innocently
ignorant
of
the
unusual
cares
which
were
distracting
the
minds
of
his
listeners
what
should
he
know
of
dressmakers
good
soul
encouraged
by
the
respectful
silence
of
his
auditors
he
calmly
expanded
and
soliloquized
on
his
favourite
topic
the
last
golden
age
of
time
the
marriage
supper
of
the
lamb
when
the
purified
earth
like
a
repentant
psyche
shall
be
restored
to
the
favour
of
a
celestial
bridegroom
and
glorified
saints
and
angels
shall
walk
familiarly
as
among
men
sakes
alive
said
little
miss
prissy
after
dinner
did
i
ever
hear
any
one
go
on
like
that
blessed
man
a
spiritual
mind
oh
miss
scudder
how
you
are
privileged
in
having
him
here
i
do
really
think
it
is
a
shame
such
a
blessed
man
a
n
t
thought
more
of
why
i
could
just
sit
and
hear
him
talk
all
day
miss
scudder
i
wish
sometimes
you
d
just
let
me
make
a
ruffled
shirt
for
him
and
do
it
all
up
myself
and
put
a
stitch
in
the
hem
that
i
learned
from
my
sister
martha
who
learned
it
from
a
french
young
lady
who
was
educated
in
a
convent
you
know
poor
things
can
do
things
right
and
i
think
never
saw
such
hemstitching
as
they
do
there
i
should
like
to
hemstitch
the
doctor
s
ruffles
he
is
it
really
makes
me
love
him
why
hearing
him
talk
put
me
in
mind
of
a
real
beautiful
song
of
watts
don
t
know
as
i
could
remember
the
and
miss
prissy
whose
musical
talent
was
one
of
her
special
tuned
her
voice
a
little
cracked
and
quavering
and
sang
with
a
vigorous
accent
on
each
accented
syllable
from
third
heaven
where
god
resides
that
holy
happy
place
the
new
jerusalem
comes
down
adorned
with
shining
grace
attending
angels
shout
for
joy
and
the
bright
armies
sing

behold
the
sacred
seat
of
your
descending
king
take
care
miss
scudder
silk
must
be
cut
exactly
on
the
bias
and
miss
prissy
hastily
finishing
her
last
quaver
caught
the
silk
and
the
scissors
out
of
scudder
s
hand
and
fell
down
at
once
from
the
millennium
into
a
discourse
on
her
own
particular
way
of
covering

doctor
s

sampson
low
son
may
so
we
go
dear
reader
long
as
we
have
a
body
and
a
soul
two
worlds
must
mingle
great
and
the
little
the
solemn
and
the
trivial
wreathing
in
and
out
like
the
grotesque
carvings
on
a
gothic
shrine
did
we
know
it
rightly
nothing
is
trivial
since
the
human
soul
with
its
awful
shadow
makes
all
things
sacred
have
not
ribbons
flowers
soiled
bits
of
gauze
trivial
trashy
fragments
of
millinery
sometimes
had
an
awful
meaning
a
deadly
power
when
they
belonged
to
one
who
should
wear
them
no
more
and
whose
beautiful
form
frail
and
crushed
as
they
is
a
hidden
and
a
vanished
thing
for
all
time
for
so
sacred
and
individual
is
a
human
being
that
of
all
the

no
one
form
ever
restores
another

broken

never

the

you
mourn
ever
meet
your
eyes
again
you
are
living
your

life
among
trifles
that
one
may
make
relics
one
false
step
one
luckless
accident
an
obstacle
on
the
track
of
a
train
the
tangling
of
the

in
shifting
a

and

the

the

which
you
toss
idly
and

from

may
become
dread
memorials
of
that
awful
tragedy
whose
deep
abyss
ever
underlies
our
common
life
chapter
xiii
the
party
well
let
us
proceed
to
tell
how
the
eventful
evening
drew
on
mary
by
miss
prissy
s
care
stood
at
last
in
a
gown
flowered
with
rosebuds
and
violets
opening
in
front
to
display
a
white
satin
skirt
trimmed
with
lace
and
flowers
her
little
feet
were
put
into
shoes
and
a
little
jaunty
cap
with
a
wreath
of
moss
rosebuds
was
fastened
over
her
shining
hair
how
miss
prissy
delighted
turned
her
round
and
round
and
then
declared
that
she
must
go
and
get
the
doctor
to
look
at
her
she
knew
he
must
be
a
man
of
taste
he
talked
so
beautifully
about
the
millennium
and
so
bursting
into
his
study
she
actually
chattered
him
back
into
the
visible
world
and
leading
the
blushing
mary
to
the
door
asked
him
point
blank
if
he
ever
saw
anything
prettier
the
doctor
being
now
wide
awake
gravely
gave
his
mind
to
the
subject
and
after
some
consideration
said
gravely
no
didn
t
think
he
ever
for
the
doctor
was
not
a
man
of
compliment
and
had
a
habit
of
always
thinking
before
he
spoke
whether
what
he
was
going
to
say
was
exactly
true
and
having
lived
some
time
in
the
family
of
president
edwards
renowned
for
beautiful
daughters
he
naturally
thought
them
over
the
doctor
looked
innocent
and
helpless
while
miss
prissy
having
got
him
now
quite
into
her
power
went
on
volubly
to
expatiate
on
the
difficulties
overcome
in
adapting
the
ancient
to
its
present
modern
fit
he
told
her
that
it
was
very
nice
yes
ma
am
at
proper
places
being
a
very
obliging
man
looked
at
whatever
he
was
directed
to
with
round
blank
eyes
but
ended
all
with
a
long
gaze
on
the
laughing
blushing
face
that
half
in
shame
and
half
in
perplexed
mirth
appeared
and
disappeared
as
miss
prissy
in
her
warmth
turned
her
round
and
showed
her
now
don
t
she
look
beautiful
miss
prissy
reiterated
for
the
twentieth
time
as
mary
left
the
room
the
doctor
looking
after
her
musingly
said
to
himself
the
king
s
daughter
is
all
glorious
within
her
clothing
is
of
wrought
gold
she
shall
be
brought
into
the
king
in
raiment
of
now
did
i
ever
said
miss
prissy
rushing
out
how
that
good
man
does
turn
everything
i
believe
you
couldn
t
get
anything
that
he
wouldn
t
find
a
text
right
out
of
the
bible
about
it
i
mean
to
get
the
linen
for
that
shirt
this
very
week
with
the
miss
wilcox
s
money
they
always
pay
well
those
wilcoxes
i
ve
worked
for
them
off
and
on
sixteen
days
and
a
quarter
to
be
sure
miss
scudder
there
s
no
real
need
of
my
doing
it
for
i
must
say
you
keep
him
looking
like
a
pink
but
only
i
feel
as
if
i
must
do
something
for
such
a
good
the
good
doctor
was
brushed
up
for
the
evening
with
zealous
care
and
energy
and
if
he
did
look
like
a
pink
it
was
certainly
no
fault
of
his
hostess
well
we
can
not
reproduce
in
detail
the
faded
glories
of
that
entertainment
nor
relate
how
the
wilcox
manor
and
gardens
were
illuminated
the
bride
wore
a
veil
of
real
carriages
rolled
and
grated
on
the
gravel
walks
and
negro
servants
in
white
kid
gloves
handed
out
ladies
in
velvet
and
satin
to
mary
s
inexperienced
eye
it
seemed
like
an
enchanted
dream
realization
of
all
she
had
dreamed
of
grand
and
high
society
she
had
her
little
triumph
of
an
evening
for
everybody
asked
who
that
beautiful
girl
was
and
more
than
one
gallant
of
the
old
newport
first
families
felt
himself
adorned
and
distinguished
to
walk
with
her
on
his
arm
busy
officious
dowagers
repeated
to
scudder
the
applauding
whispers
that
followed
her
wherever
she
went
really
scudder
said
gallant
old
general
wilcox
where
have
you
kept
such
a
beauty
all
this
time
it
s
a
sin
and
a
shame
to
hide
such
a
light
under
a
and
scudder
though
of
course
like
you
and
me
sensible
reader
properly
apprised
of
the
perishable
nature
of
such
fleeting
honours
was
like
us
too
but
a
mortal
and
smiled
condescendingly
on
the
follies
of
the
scene
the
house
was
divided
by
a
wide
hall
opening
by
doors
the
front
one
upon
the
street
the
back
into
a
large
garden
the
broad
central
walk
of
which
edged
on
each
side
with
high
clipped
hedges
of
box
now
resplendent
with
coloured
lamps
seemed
to
continue
the
prospect
in
a
brilliant
vista
the
garden
was
lighted
in
every
part
and
the
company
dispersed
themselves
about
it
in
picturesque
groups
we
have
the
image
in
our
mind
of
mary
as
she
stood
with
her
little
hat
and
wreath
of
rosebuds
her
fluttering
ribbons
and
rich
brocade
as
it
were
a
picture
framed
in
the
doorway
with
her
back
to
the
illuminated
garden
and
her
calm
innocent
face
regarding
with
a
pleased
wonder
the
unaccustomed
gaieties
within
her
dress
which
under
miss
prissy
s
forming
hand
had
been
made
to
assume
that
appearance
of
style
and
fashion
which
more
particularly
characterised
the
mode
of
those
times
formed
a
singular
but
not
unpleasing
contrast
to
the
sort
of
dewy
freshness
of
air
and
mien
which
was
characteristic
of
her
style
of
beauty
it
seemed
so
to
represent
a
being
who
was
in
the
world
yet
not
of
it
though
living
habitually
in
a
higher
region
of
thought
and
feeling
was
artlessly
curious
and
innocently
pleased
with
a
fresh
experience
in
an
altogether
untried
sphere
the
feeling
of
being
in
a
circle
to
which
she
did
not
belong
where
her
presence
was
in
a
manner
an
accident
and
where
she
felt
none
of
the
responsibilities
which
come
from
being
a
component
part
of
a
society
gave
to
her
a
quiet
disengaged
air
which
produced
all
the
effect
of
the
perfect
ease
of
high
breeding
while
she
stands
there
there
comes
out
of
the
door
of
the
bridal
a
gentleman
with
a
lady
on
either
arm
with
whom
he
seems
wholly
absorbed
he
is
of
middle
height
peculiarly
graceful
in
form
and
moulding
with
that
indescribable
air
of
high
breeding
which
marks
the
polished
man
of
the
world
his
head
delicate
profile
fascinating
sweetness
of
smile
and
above
all
an
eye
which
seemed
to
have
an
almost
mesmeric
power
of
attraction
were
traits
which
distinguished
one
of
the
most
celebrated
men
of
the
time
and
one
whose
peculiar
history
yet
lives
not
only
in
our
national
records
but
in
the
private
annals
of
many
an
american
family
good
heavens
he
said
suddenly
pausing
in
conversation
as
his
eye
accidentally
fell
upon
mary
who
is
that
lovely
creature
oh
that
said
wilcox
why
that
is
mary
scudder
her
father
was
a
family
connection
of
the
general
s
the
family
are
in
rather
modest
circumstances
but
highly
after
a
few
moments
more
of
ordinary
in
which
from
time
to
time
he
darted
upon
her
glances
of
rapid
and
piercing
observation
the
gentleman
might
have
been
observed
to
disembarrass
himself
of
one
of
the
ladies
on
his
arm
by
passing
her
with
a
compliment
and
a
bow
to
another
gallant
and
after
a
few
moments
more
he
spoke
something
to
wilcox
in
a
low
voice
and
with
that
gentle
air
of
deferential
sweetness
which
always
made
everybody
well
satisfied
to
do
his
will
the
consequence
was
that
in
a
few
moments
mary
was
startled
from
her
calm
speculations
by
the
voice
of
wilcox
saying
at
her
elbow
in
a
formal
tone
miss
scudder
i
have
the
honour
to
present
to
your
acquaintance
colonel
burr
of
the
united
states
chapter
xiv
at
the
period
of
which
we
are
speaking
no
name
in
the
new
republic
was
associated
with
ideas
of
more
brilliant
promise
or
invested
with
a
greater
prestige
of
popularity
and
success
than
that
of
colonel
aaron
burr
sprung
of
a
line
distinguished
for
intellectual
ability
the
grandson
of
a
man
whose
genius
has
swayed
new
england
from
that
day
to
son
of
parents
eminent
in
their
day
for
influential
and
popular
talent
he
united
in
himself
the
quickest
perceptions
and
keenest
delicacy
of
fibre
with
the
most
diamond
hardness
and
unflinching
steadiness
of
purpose
apt
subtle
dazzling
adroit
no
man
in
his
time
ever
began
life
with
fairer
chances
for
success
and
fame
his
name
as
it
fell
on
the
ear
of
our
heroine
carried
with
it
the
suggestion
of
all
this
and
when
with
his
peculiarly
engaging
smile
he
offered
his
arm
she
felt
a
little
of
the
flutter
natural
to
a
modest
young
person
unexpectedly
honoured
with
the
notice
of
the
distinguished
of
the
earth
whom
it
is
seldom
the
lot
of
humble
individuals
to
know
except
by
distant
report
but
although
mary
was
a
blushing
and
sensitive
person
she
was
not
what
is
commonly
called
a
diffident
girl
her
nerves
had
that
steady
poise
which
gave
her
presence
of
mind
in
the
most
unwonted
circumstances
the
first
few
sentences
addressed
to
her
by
her
new
companion
were
in
a
tone
and
style
altogether
different
from
any
in
which
she
had
ever
been
from
the
dashing
frankness
of
her
sailor
lover
and
from
the
rustic
gallantry
of
her
other
admirers
that
indescribable
mixture
of
ease
and
deference
guided
by
a
fine
tact
which
shows
the
practised
man
of
the
world
made
its
impression
on
her
immediately
as
the
breeze
on
the
chords
of
a
wind
harp
she
felt
herself
pleasantly
swayed
and
breathed
upon
it
was
as
if
an
atmosphere
were
around
her
in
which
she
felt
a
perfect
ease
and
assurance
that
her
lightest
word
might
launch
forth
safely
as
a
tiny
boat
on
the
smooth
glassy
mirror
of
her
listener
s
pleased
attention
i
came
to
newport
only
on
a
visit
of
business
he
said
after
a
few
moments
of
introductory
conversation
i
was
not
prepared
for
its
many
newport
has
a
great
deal
of
beautiful
scenery
said
mary
i
have
heard
that
it
was
celebrated
for
the
beauty
of
its
scenery
and
of
its
ladies
he
answered
but
he
added
with
a
quick
flash
of
his
dark
eye
i
never
realised
the
fact
the
glance
of
the
eye
pointed
and
limited
the
compliment
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
wary
shrewdness
in
it
he
was
measuring
how
deeply
his
shaft
had
sunk
as
he
always
instinctively
measured
the
person
he
talked
with
mary
had
been
told
of
her
beauty
since
her
childhood
notwithstanding
her
mother
had
assayed
all
that
transparent
respectable
hoaxing
by
which
discreet
mothers
endeavour
to
blind
their
daughters
to
the
real
facts
in
such
cases
but
in
her
own
calm
balanced
mind
she
had
accepted
what
she
was
so
often
told
as
a
quiet
verity
and
therefore
she
neither
fluttered
nor
blushed
on
this
occasion
but
regarded
her
auditor
with
a
pleased
attention
as
one
who
was
saying
obliging
things
cool
he
thought
to
himself
little
rustic
belle
i
suppose
well
aware
of
her
own
value
rather
piquante
upon
my
shall
we
walk
in
the
garden
he
said
the
evening
is
so
they
passed
out
the
door
and
began
promenading
the
long
walk
at
the
bottom
of
the
alley
he
stopped
and
turning
looked
up
the
vista
of
box
ending
in
the
rooms
where
gentlemen
with
powdered
heads
lace
ruffles
and
glittering
were
handing
ladies
in
stiff
brocades
whose
towering
heads
were
shaded
by
ostrich
feathers
and
sparkling
with
gems
quite
on
my
word
he
said
tell
me
do
you
often
have
such
brilliant
entertainments
as
these
i
suppose
they
do
said
mary
i
never
was
at
one
before
but
i
sometimes
hear
of
and
do
not
attend
said
the
gentleman
with
an
accent
which
made
the
inquiry
a
marked
compliment
no
i
do
not
said
mary
these
people
generally
do
not
visit
what
a
pity
he
said
that
their
parties
should
want
such
an
ornament
but
he
added
this
night
must
make
them
aware
of
their
oversight
if
you
are
not
always
in
society
after
this
it
will
surely
not
be
from
want
of
you
are
very
kind
to
think
so
replied
mary
but
even
if
it
were
to
be
so
i
should
not
see
my
way
clear
to
be
often
in
such
scenes
as
her
companion
looked
at
her
with
a
glance
a
little
doubtful
and
amused
and
and
pray
why
not
if
the
inquiry
be
not
presumptuous
because
said
mary
i
should
be
afraid
they
would
take
too
much
time
and
thought
and
lead
me
to
forget
the
great
object
of
the
simple
gravity
with
which
this
was
said
as
if
quite
assured
of
the
sympathy
of
her
auditor
appeared
to
give
him
a
secret
amusement
his
bright
dark
eyes
danced
as
if
he
suppressed
some
quick
repartee
but
drooping
his
long
lashes
deferentially
he
said
in
gentle
i
should
like
to
know
what
so
beautiful
a
young
lady
considers
the
great
object
of
life
mary
answered
reverentially
in
those
words
familiar
from
infancy
to
every
puritan
child
to
glorify
god
and
enjoy
him
for
he
said
looking
straight
into
her
eyes
with
that
penetrating
glance
with
which
he
was
accustomed
to
take
the
gauge
of
every
one
with
whom
he
conversed
is
it
not
said
mary
looking
back
calm
and
firm
into
the
sparkling
restless
depths
of
his
eye
in
that
moment
two
souls
going
with
the
whole
force
of
their
being
in
two
opposite
directions
looked
out
of
their
windows
at
each
other
with
a
fixed
and
earnest
recognition
burr
was
practised
in
every
act
of
gallantry
he
had
made
womankind
a
study
he
never
saw
a
beautiful
face
and
form
without
a
sort
of
restless
desire
to
experiment
upon
it
and
try
his
power
over
the
interior
inhabitant
but
just
at
this
moment
something
streamed
into
his
soul
from
those
blue
earnest
eyes
which
brought
back
to
his
mind
what
pious
people
had
so
often
told
him
of
his
beautiful
and
esther
burr
he
was
one
of
those
persons
who
systematically
managed
and
played
upon
himself
and
others
as
a
skilful
musician
on
an
instrument
yet
one
secret
of
his
fascination
was
the
naïveté
with
which
at
some
moments
he
would
abandon
himself
to
some
little
impulse
of
a
nature
originally
sensitive
and
tender
had
the
strain
of
feeling
which
now
awoke
in
him
come
over
him
elsewhere
he
would
have
shut
down
some
spring
in
his
mind
and
excluded
it
in
a
moment
but
talking
with
a
beautiful
creature
whom
he
wished
to
please
he
gave
way
at
once
to
the
emotion
real
tears
stood
in
his
fine
eyes
he
raised
mary
s
hand
to
his
lips
and
kissed
it
thank
you
my
beautiful
child
for
so
good
a
thought
it
is
truly
a
noble
sentiment
though
practicable
only
to
those
gifted
with
angelic
oh
i
trust
not
said
mary
earnestly
touched
and
wrought
upon
more
than
she
herself
knew
by
the
beautiful
eyes
the
modulated
voice
the
charm
of
manner
which
seemed
to
enfold
her
like
an
italian
summer
burr
real
sigh
of
his
better
nature
but
passed
out
with
all
the
more
freedom
that
he
felt
it
would
interest
his
fair
companion
who
for
the
time
being
was
the
one
woman
in
the
world
to
him
pure
artless
souls
like
yours
he
said
can
not
measure
the
temptations
of
those
who
are
called
to
the
real
battle
of
life
in
a
world
like
this
how
many
nobler
aspirations
fall
withered
in
the
fierce
heat
and
struggle
of
the
conflict
he
was
saying
then
what
he
really
bitterly
felt
but
using
this
real
feeling
advisedly
and
with
skilful
tact
for
the
purpose
of
the
hour
what
was
this
purpose
to
win
the
regard
the
esteem
the
tenderness
of
a
religious
exalted
nature
shrined
in
a
beautiful
gain
and
hold
ascendency
it
was
a
habit
one
of
those
forms
of
refined
which
he
pursued
reckless
of
consequences
he
had
found
now
the
of
the
character
it
was
a
beautiful
instrument
and
he
was
to
play
on
it
i
think
sir
said
mary
modestly
that
you
forget
the
great
provision
made
for
our
how
said
he
they
that
wait
on
the
lord
shall
renew
their
strength
she
replied
gently
he
looked
at
her
as
she
spoke
these
words
with
a
pleased
artistic
perception
of
the
contrast
between
her
worldly
attire
and
the
simple
religious
earnestness
of
her
words
she
is
entrancing
he
thought
to
himself
so
altogether
fresh
and
my
sweet
saint
he
said
such
as
you
are
the
appointed
guardians
of
us
coarser
beings
the
prayers
of
a
soul
given
up
to
worldliness
and
ambition
effect
little
you
must
intercede
for
us
i
am
very
orthodox
you
see
he
added
with
that
subtle
smile
which
sometimes
irradiated
his
features
i
am
fully
aware
of
all
that
your
reverend
doctor
tells
you
of
the
worthlessness
of
unregenerate
doings
and
so
when
i
see
angels
walking
below
i
try
to
secure
a
friend
at
he
saw
that
mary
looked
embarrassed
and
pained
at
this
banter
and
therefore
added
with
a
delicate
shading
of
in
truth
my
fair
young
friend
i
hope
you
will
sometimes
pray
for
me
i
am
sure
if
i
have
any
chance
of
good
it
must
come
to
me
in
such
indeed
i
will
said
mary
fervently
her
little
heart
full
tears
in
her
eyes
her
breath
coming
quick
and
she
added
with
a
deepening
colour
i
am
sure
burr
there
should
be
a
covenant
blessing
for
you
if
for
any
one
for
you
are
the
son
of
a
holy
eh
bien
mon
ami
qu
que
tu
fais
ici
said
a
gay
voice
behind
a
clump
of
box
and
immediately
there
started
out
like
a
french
picture
from
its
frame
a
figure
dressed
like
a
marquise
of
louis
fourteenth
s
time
with
powdered
hair
sparkling
with
diamonds
rien
que
m
amuser
he
replied
with
ready
presence
of
mind
in
the
same
tone
and
then
permit
me
madame
to
present
to
you
a
charming
specimen
of
our
genuine
new
england
flowers
miss
scudder
i
have
the
honour
to
present
you
to
the
acquaintance
of
madame
de
i
am
very
happy
said
the
lady
with
a
sweet
lisping
accentuation
of
english
which
well
became
her
lovely
mouth
miss
scudder
i
hope
is
very
well
mary
replied
affirmatively
her
eyes
resting
the
while
with
pleased
admiration
on
the
brilliant
speaking
face
and
eyes
which
seemed
looking
her
through
monsieur
la
trouve
bien
séduisante
apparemment
said
the
stranger
in
a
low
rapid
voice
to
the
gentleman
in
a
manner
which
showed
a
mingling
of
pique
and
admiration
petite
jalouse
t
assure
toi
he
replied
with
a
look
and
manner
into
which
with
that
mobile
force
which
was
peculiar
to
himself
he
threw
the
most
tender
and
passionate
devotion
ne
pas
à
toi
and
as
he
spoke
he
offered
her
his
other
arm
allow
me
to
be
an
unworthy
link
between
the
beauty
of
france
and
the
lady
swept
a
proud
curtsy
backward
bridled
her
beautiful
neck
and
signed
for
them
to
pass
i
am
waiting
here
for
a
friend
she
said
your
will
is
always
mine
replied
burr
bowing
with
proud
humility
and
passing
on
with
mary
to
the
here
the
company
were
fast
assembling
in
that
high
tide
of
which
generally
sets
in
at
this
crisis
of
the
evening
the
scene
in
truth
was
a
specimen
of
a
range
of
society
which
in
those
times
could
have
been
assembled
nowhere
else
but
in
newport
there
stood
in
the
tranquil
majesty
of
his
lordly
form
and
by
his
side
the
alert
compact
figure
of
his
cotemporary
and
theological
opponent
styles
who
animated
by
the
social
spirit
of
the
hour
was
dispensing
courtesies
to
the
right
and
left
with
the
debonair
grace
of
the
trained
gentleman
of
the
old
school
near
by
and
engaging
from
time
to
time
in
conversation
with
them
stood
a
jewish
rabbi
with
one
or
two
wealthy
bankers
of
the
same
race
whose
olive
complexion
keen
eyes
and
aquiline
profile
spoke
their
descent
and
gave
a
picturesque
and
foreign
grace
to
the
scene
colonel
burr
one
of
the
most
brilliant
and
distinguished
of
the
rising
men
of
the
new
republic
and
colonel
de
frontignac
who
had
won
for
himself
laurels
in
the
corps
of
lafayette
during
the
recent
revolutionary
struggle
with
his
brilliant
and
accomplished
wife
were
all
unexpected
and
distinguished
additions
to
the
circle
burr
gently
cleared
the
way
for
his
fair
companion
and
purposely
placing
her
where
the
full
light
of
the
wax
chandeliers
set
off
her
beauty
to
the
best
advantage
devoted
himself
to
her
with
a
subserviency
as
deferential
as
if
she
had
been
a
goddess
for
all
that
he
was
not
unobservant
when
a
few
moments
after
madame
de
frontignac
was
led
in
on
the
arm
of
a
distinguished
senator
with
whom
she
was
presently
in
full
flirtation
he
observed
with
a
quiet
furtive
smile
that
while
she
rattled
and
fanned
herself
and
listened
with
apparent
attention
to
the
flatteries
addressed
to
her
she
darted
every
now
and
then
a
glance
keen
as
a
steel
blade
towards
him
and
his
companion
he
was
perfectly
adroit
in
playing
off
one
woman
against
another
and
it
struck
him
with
a
pleasant
sense
of
oddity
how
perfectly
unconscious
his
sweet
and
saintly
neighbour
was
of
the
position
in
which
she
was
supposed
to
stand
by
her
rival
illustration
burr
amuses
sampson
low
son
june
and
poor
mary
all
this
while
in
her
simplicity
really
thought
she
had
seen
traces
of
what
she
would
have
called
the
strivings
of
the
spirit
in
his
alas
that
a
phrase
weighed
down
with
such
a
mysterious
truth
and
meaning
should
ever
come
to
fall
on
the
ear
as
mere
empty
cant
with
mary
it
was
a
living
form
as
were
all
her
words
for
in
nothing
was
the
puritan
education
more
marked
than
in
the
earnest
reality
and
truthfulness
which
it
gave
to
language
and
even
now
as
she
stands
by
his
side
her
large
blue
eye
is
occasionally
fixed
in
dreamy
reverie
as
she
thinks
what
a
triumph
of
divine
grace
it
would
be
if
these
inward
movings
of
her
companion
s
mind
should
lead
him
as
all
the
pious
of
new
england
hoped
to
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
president
edwards
she
wishes
that
she
could
some
time
see
him
alone
where
she
could
talk
with
him
undisturbed
she
was
too
humble
too
modest
fully
to
accept
the
delicious
flattery
which
he
had
breathed
in
implying
that
her
hand
had
power
to
unseal
the
fountains
of
good
in
his
soul
but
still
it
thrilled
through
all
the
sensitive
strings
of
her
nature
a
tremulous
flutter
of
suggestion
she
had
read
instances
of
striking
and
wonderful
conversions
from
words
dropped
by
children
and
women
and
suppose
some
such
thing
should
happen
to
her
that
this
so
charming
distinguished
and
powerful
being
should
be
called
into
the
fold
of
christ
s
church
by
her
means
no
it
was
too
much
to
be
hoped
but
the
very
possibility
was
thrilling
when
after
supper
scudder
and
the
doctor
made
their
adieus
burr
s
devotion
was
still
unabated
with
an
enchanting
mixture
of
reverence
and
fatherly
protection
he
waited
on
her
to
the
last
shawled
her
with
delicate
care
and
handed
her
into
the
small
waggon
as
if
it
had
been
the
coach
of
a
duchess
i
have
pleasant
recollections
connected
with
this
kind
of
an
establishment
he
said
as
after
looking
carefully
at
the
harness
he
passed
the
reins
into
scudder
s
hands
it
reminds
me
of
and
old
times
i
hope
your
horse
is
quite
safe
madam
oh
yes
said
scudder
i
perfectly
understand
pardon
the
suggestion
he
replied
what
is
there
that
a
new
england
matron
does
not
understand
doctor
i
must
call
and
have
a
little
talk
with
you
my
theologies
you
know
need
a
little
we
should
all
be
happy
to
see
you
colonel
burr
said
scudder
we
live
in
a
very
plain
way
it
is
but
can
always
find
a
place
for
a
friend
that
i
trust
is
what
you
meant
to
say
he
replied
bowing
with
his
own
peculiar
grace
as
the
carriage
drove
off
really
a
most
charming
person
is
this
colonel
burr
said
scudder
he
seems
a
very
frank
ingenuous
young
person
said
the
doctor
one
can
not
but
mourn
that
the
son
of
such
gracious
parents
should
be
left
to
wander
into
oh
he
is
not
an
infidel
said
mary
he
is
far
from
it
though
i
think
that
his
mind
is
a
little
darkened
on
some
ah
said
the
doctor
have
you
had
any
special
religious
conversation
with
him
a
little
said
mary
and
it
seems
to
me
that
his
mind
is
perplexed
somewhat
in
regard
to
the
doings
of
the
unregenerate
i
fear
that
it
has
rather
proved
a
in
his
way
but
he
showed
so
much
feeling
i
could
really
see
the
tears
in
his
his
mother
was
a
most
godly
woman
mary
said
the
doctor
she
was
called
from
her
youth
and
her
beautiful
person
became
a
temple
for
the
indwelling
of
the
holy
spirit
aaron
burr
is
a
child
of
many
prayers
and
therefore
there
is
hope
that
he
may
yet
be
effectually
called
he
studied
awhile
with
bellamy
he
added
musingly
i
have
often
doubted
whether
bellamy
took
just
the
right
course
with
i
hope
he
will
call
and
talk
with
you
said
mary
earnestly
what
a
blessing
to
the
world
if
such
talents
as
his
could
become
wholly
consecrated
not
many
rich
not
many
mighty
not
many
noble
are
called
said
the
doctor
yet
if
it
would
please
the
lord
to
employ
my
instrumentality
and
prayers
how
much
should
i
rejoice
i
was
struck
he
added
when
i
saw
those
jews
present
with
the
thought
that
it
was
as
it
were
a
type
of
that
last
ingathering
when
both
jew
and
gentile
should
sit
down
lovingly
together
at
the
gospel
feast
it
is
only
by
passing
over
and
forgetting
these
present
years
when
so
few
are
called
and
the
gospel
makes
such
slow
progress
and
looking
forward
to
that
glorious
time
that
i
find
comfort
if
the
lord
but
use
me
as
a
dumb
to
that
heavenly
jerusalem
i
shall
be
thus
they
talked
while
the
waggon
jogged
slowly
homeward
while
the
frogs
and
turtles
and
the
distant
ripple
of
the
sea
made
a
drowsy
mingling
concert
in
the
air
meanwhile
colonel
burr
had
returned
to
the
lighted
rooms
and
it
was
not
long
before
his
quick
eye
sought
out
madame
de
frontignac
standing
pensively
in
a
half
hid
by
the
curtain
he
stole
up
softly
behind
her
and
whispered
something
in
her
ear
in
a
moment
she
turned
on
him
a
face
glowing
with
anger
and
drew
back
haughtily
but
burr
remarked
the
glitter
of
tears
not
quite
dried
even
by
the
angry
flash
of
her
eyes
in
what
have
i
had
the
misfortune
to
offend
he
said
crossing
his
arms
upon
his
breast
i
stand
at
the
bar
and
plead
not
he
spoke
in
french
and
she
replied
in
the
same
smooth
it
was
not
for
her
to
dispute
monsieur
s
right
to
amuse
burr
drew
nearer
and
spoke
in
those
persuasive
pleading
tones
which
he
had
ever
at
command
and
in
that
language
whose
very
structure
in
its
delicate
tu
toi
gives
such
opportunity
for
gliding
on
through
shade
after
shade
of
intimacy
and
tenderness
till
gradually
the
haughty
fire
of
the
eyes
was
quenched
in
tears
and
in
the
sudden
revulsion
of
a
strong
impulsive
nature
she
poured
out
to
him
what
she
called
words
of
friendship
but
which
carried
with
them
all
the
warmth
of
that
sacred
fire
which
is
given
to
woman
to
light
and
warm
the
temple
of
home
and
which
sears
and
scars
when
kindled
for
any
other
shrine
and
yet
this
woman
was
the
wife
of
his
friend
and
associate
monsieur
de
frontignac
was
a
grave
and
dignified
man
of
virginie
de
frontignac
had
been
given
him
to
wife
when
but
eighteen
a
beautiful
generous
impulsive
wilful
girl
she
had
accepted
him
gladly
for
very
substantial
reasons
first
that
she
might
come
out
of
the
convent
where
she
was
kept
for
the
very
purpose
of
educating
her
in
ignorance
of
the
world
she
was
to
live
in
second
that
she
might
wear
velvet
lace
cashmere
and
jewels
third
that
she
might
be
a
madame
free
to
go
and
come
ride
walk
and
talk
without
surveillance
fourth
and
consequent
upon
this
that
she
might
go
into
company
and
have
admirers
and
adorers
she
supposed
of
course
she
loved
her
else
should
she
love
he
was
the
only
man
except
her
father
and
brothers
that
she
had
ever
seen
and
in
the
fortnight
that
preceded
their
marriage
did
he
not
send
her
the
most
splendid
every
day
with
bouquets
of
every
pattern
that
ever
taxed
the
brain
of
a
parisian
artiste
was
not
the
corbeille
de
mariage
a
wonder
and
an
envy
to
all
her
acquaintance
and
after
marriage
had
she
not
found
him
always
a
steady
indulgent
friend
easy
to
be
coaxed
as
any
grave
papa
on
his
part
monsieur
de
frontignac
cherished
his
young
wife
as
a
beautiful
though
somewhat
absurd
little
pet
and
amused
himself
with
her
frolics
and
gambols
as
the
gravest
person
often
will
with
those
of
a
kitten
it
was
not
until
she
knew
aaron
burr
that
poor
virginie
de
frontignac
came
to
that
great
awakening
of
her
being
which
teaches
woman
what
she
is
and
transforms
her
from
a
careless
child
to
a
thinking
suffering
human
being
for
the
first
time
in
his
society
she
became
aware
of
the
charm
of
a
polished
and
cultivated
mind
able
with
exquisite
tact
to
adapt
itself
to
hers
to
draw
forth
her
inquiries
to
excite
her
tastes
to
stimulate
her
observation
a
new
world
awoke
around
world
of
literature
of
taste
of
art
of
sentiment
she
felt
somehow
as
if
she
had
gained
the
growth
of
years
in
a
few
months
she
felt
within
herself
the
stirring
of
dim
uprising
of
a
new
power
of
and
self
sacrifice
a
trance
of
hero
worship
a
cloud
of
high
ideal
images
the
lighting
up
in
short
of
all
that
god
has
laid
ready
to
be
enkindled
in
woman
s
nature
when
the
time
comes
to
sanctify
her
as
the
pure
priestess
of
a
domestic
temple
but
alas
it
was
kindled
by
one
who
did
it
only
for
an
experiment
because
he
felt
an
artistic
pleasure
in
the
beautiful
light
and
heat
which
had
burned
a
soul
away
burr
was
one
of
those
men
willing
to
play
with
any
charming
woman
the
game
of
those
navigators
who
give
to
simple
natives
glass
beads
and
feathers
in
return
for
gold
and
diamonds
to
accept
from
a
woman
her
heart
s
blood
in
return
for
such
odds
ends
and
clippings
as
he
could
afford
her
from
the
serious
ambitions
of
life
look
in
with
us
one
moment
now
that
the
party
is
over
and
the
busy
hum
of
voices
and
blaze
of
lights
have
died
down
to
midnight
silence
and
darkness
we
make
you
clairvoyant
and
you
may
look
through
the
walls
of
this
stately
old
mansion
still
known
as
that
where
rochambeau
held
his
headquarters
into
this
room
where
two
wax
candles
are
burning
on
a
before
an
mirror
the
slumbrous
folds
of
the
curtains
are
drawn
with
stately
gloom
around
a
high
bed
where
colonel
de
frontignac
has
been
for
many
hours
quietly
asleep
but
opposite
resting
with
one
elbow
on
the
her
long
black
hair
hanging
down
over
her
and
the
brush
hanging
listlessly
in
her
hand
sits
virginie
looking
fixedly
into
the
dreamy
depths
of
the
mirror
scarcely
twenty
yet
all
unwarned
of
the
world
of
power
and
passion
that
lay
slumbering
in
her
girl
s
heart
led
in
the
meshes
of
custom
and
society
to
utter
vows
and
take
responsibilities
of
whose
nature
she
was
no
more
apprised
than
is
a
slumbering
babe
and
now
at
last
fully
awake
feeling
the
whole
power
of
that
mysterious
and
awful
force
which
we
call
love
yet
shuddering
to
call
it
by
its
name
yet
by
its
light
beginning
to
understand
all
she
is
capable
of
and
all
that
marriage
should
have
been
to
her
she
struggles
feebly
and
confusedly
with
her
fate
still
clinging
to
the
name
of
duty
and
baptizing
as
friendship
the
strange
new
feeling
which
makes
her
tremble
through
all
her
being
how
can
she
dream
of
danger
in
such
a
feeling
when
it
seems
to
her
the
awakening
of
all
that
is
highest
and
noblest
within
her
she
remembers
when
she
thought
of
nothing
beyond
an
opera
ticket
or
a
new
dress
and
now
she
feels
that
there
might
be
to
her
a
friend
for
whose
sake
she
would
try
to
be
noble
and
great
and
good
for
whom
all
all
high
endeavour
all
difficult
virtue
would
become
possible
who
would
be
to
her
life
inspiration
order
beauty
she
sees
him
as
woman
always
sees
the
one
she
great
and
good
for
when
did
a
loving
woman
ever
believe
a
man
otherwise
too
noble
too
great
too
high
too
good
she
thinks
for
her
poor
trivial
ignorant
trifling
childish
virginie
has
he
not
commanded
armies
she
thinks
is
he
not
eloquent
in
the
senate
and
yet
what
interest
he
has
taken
in
her
a
poor
unformed
ignorant
creature
she
never
tried
to
improve
herself
till
since
she
knew
him
and
he
is
so
considerate
too
so
respectful
so
thoughtful
and
kind
so
manly
and
honourable
and
has
such
a
tender
friendship
for
her
such
a
brotherly
fatherly
solicitude
and
yet
if
she
is
haughty
or
imperious
or
severe
how
humbled
and
grieved
he
looks
how
strange
that
she
could
have
power
over
such
a
man
it
is
one
of
the
saddest
truths
of
this
sad
mystery
of
life
that
woman
is
often
never
so
much
an
angel
as
just
the
moment
before
she
falls
into
the
bottomless
depths
of
perdition
and
what
shall
we
say
of
the
man
who
leads
her
up
to
this
spot
as
an
experiment
who
amuses
himself
with
taking
woman
after
woman
up
these
dazzling
delusive
heights
knowing
as
he
certainly
must
where
they
lead
we
have
been
told
in
extenuation
of
the
course
of
aaron
burr
that
he
was
not
a
man
of
gross
passions
or
of
coarse
indulgence
but
in
the
most
consummate
and
refined
sense
a
man
of
gallantry
this
then
is
the
descriptive
name
which
polite
society
has
invented
for
the
man
who
does
this
thing
of
old
it
was
thought
that
one
who
administered
poison
in
the
sacramental
bread
and
wine
had
touched
the
very
height
of
impious
sacrilege
but
this
crime
is
white
by
the
side
of
his
who
poisons
god
s
eternal
sacrament
of
and
destroys
woman
s
soul
through
her
noblest
and
purest
affections
we
have
given
you
the
after
view
of
most
of
the
actors
of
our
little
scene
and
therefore
it
is
but
fair
that
you
should
have
a
peep
over
the
colonel
s
shoulder
as
he
sums
up
the
evening
in
a
letter
to
a
friend
my
dear
as
to
the
business
it
gets
on
rather
slowly
and
are
away
and
the
coalition
can
not
be
formed
without
them
they
set
out
a
week
ago
from
philadelphia
and
are
yet
on
the
road
meanwhile
we
have
some
providential
alleviations
as
for
example
a
at
the
wilcox
s
which
was
really
quite
an
affair
i
saw
the
prettiest
little
puritan
there
that
i
have
set
eyes
on
for
many
a
day
i
really
couldn
t
help
getting
up
a
flirtation
with
her
though
it
was
much
like
flirting
with
a
small
copy
of
the
assembly
s
catechism
of
which
i
had
enough
years
ago
heaven
knows
but
really
such
a
naïve
earnest
little
saint
who
has
such
a
real
deadly
belief
and
opens
such
blue
pitying
eyes
on
one
is
quite
a
stimulating
novelty
i
got
myself
well
scolded
by
the
fair
madame
as
angels
scold
and
had
to
plead
like
a
lawyer
to
make
my
peace
after
all
woman
really
enchains
me
don
t
shake
your
head
wisely
what
is
going
to
be
the
end
of
it
i
am
sure
i
don
t
know
we
ll
see
when
the
time
comes
meanwhile
push
the
business
ahead
with
all
your
might
i
shall
not
be
idle
must
canvass
the
senate
thoroughly
i
wish
i
could
be
in
two
places
at
once
and
i
would
do
it
myself
au
revoir
ever
yours
chapter
xv
and
now
mary
said
scudder
at
five
o
clock
the
next
morning
you
know
is
the
doctor
s
fast
and
so
we
won
t
get
any
dinner
and
it
will
be
a
good
time
to
do
up
all
our
little
odd
jobs
miss
prissy
promised
to
come
in
for
two
or
three
hours
this
morning
to
alter
the
waist
of
that
black
silk
and
i
shouldn
t
be
surprised
if
we
could
get
it
all
done
and
ready
to
wear
by
we
will
remark
by
way
of
explanation
to
a
part
of
this
conversation
that
our
doctor
who
was
a
specimen
of
life
in
earnest
made
a
practice
through
the
greater
part
of
his
pulpit
course
of
spending
every
saturday
as
a
day
of
fasting
and
retirement
in
preparation
for
the
duties
of
the
sabbath
accordingly
the
early
breakfast
things
were
no
sooner
disposed
of
than
miss
prissy
s
quick
footsteps
might
have
been
heard
pattering
in
the
kitchen
well
miss
scudder
how
you
do
this
morning
and
how
you
do
mary
well
if
you
aint
the
beaters
up
just
as
early
as
ever
and
everything
cleared
away
i
was
telling
miss
wilcox
that
there
didn
t
ever
seem
to
be
anything
done
in
miss
scudder
s
kitchen
and
i
did
verily
believe
you
made
your
beds
before
you
got
up
in
the
morning
well
well
wasn
t
that
a
party
last
night
she
said
as
she
sat
down
with
the
black
silk
and
prepared
her
i
must
rip
this
myself
miss
scudder
for
there
s
a
great
deal
in
ripping
silk
so
as
not
to
let
anybody
know
where
it
has
been
sewed
you
didn
t
know
that
i
was
at
the
party
did
you
well
i
was
you
see
i
thought
i
d
just
step
round
there
to
see
about
that
money
to
get
the
doctor
s
shirt
with
and
there
i
found
miss
wilcox
with
so
many
things
on
her
mind
and
says
she
miss
prissy
you
don
t
know
how
much
it
would
help
me
if
i
had
somebody
like
you
just
to
look
after
things
a
little
here
and
says
i
miss
wilcox
you
just
go
right
to
your
room
and
dress
and
don
t
you
give
yourself
one
minute
s
thought
about
anything
and
you
see
if
i
don
t
have
everything
just
and
so
there
i
was
in
for
it
and
i
just
stayed
through
and
it
was
well
i
did
for
dinah
she
wouldn
t
have
put
ne
er
enough
egg
in
the
coffee
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
me
why
i
just
went
and
beat
up
four
eggs
with
my
own
hand
and
stirred
em
into
the
grounds
well
but
really
wasn
t
i
behind
the
door
and
didn
t
i
peep
into
the
i
saw
who
was
on
miss
mary
well
they
do
say
he
s
the
handsomest
most
fascinating
man
why
all
the
ladies
in
philadelphia
are
in
a
perfect
quarrel
about
him
and
i
heard
he
said
that
he
hadn
t
seen
such
a
beauty
he
didn
t
remember
we
all
know
that
beauty
is
of
small
consequence
said
scudder
i
hope
mary
has
been
brought
up
to
feel
oh
of
course
said
miss
prissy
it
s
just
like
a
fading
flower
all
is
to
be
good
and
useful
and
that
s
what
she
is
and
i
told
em
that
her
beauty
was
the
least
part
of
her
though
i
must
say
that
dress
did
fit
like
a
biscuit
if
it
was
my
own
fitting
but
miss
scudder
what
do
you
think
i
heard
em
saying
about
the
good
old
doctor
i
am
sure
i
don
t
know
said
scudder
i
only
know
they
couldn
t
say
anything
well
no
not
bad
exactly
said
miss
prissy
but
they
say
he
s
getting
such
strange
notions
in
his
head
why
i
heard
some
of
em
say
he
was
going
to
come
out
and
preach
against
the
slave
trade
and
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
what
newport
folks
will
do
if
that
s
wicked
there
aint
hardly
any
money
here
that
s
made
any
other
way
it
ll
certainly
make
a
great
noise
and
talk
and
make
everybody
angry
and
i
hope
the
doctor
aint
to
do
anything
of
that
i
believe
he
is
miss
prissy
said
scudder
he
thinks
it
s
a
great
sin
that
ought
to
be
rebuked
and
i
think
so
too
she
said
bracing
herself
resolutely
that
was
scudder
s
opinion
when
i
first
married
him
and
it
s
oh
ah
yes
well
if
it
s
a
sin
of
course
said
miss
prissy
but
then
dear
me
why
just
think
how
many
great
houses
are
living
on
it
why
there
s
general
wilcox
himself
and
he
s
a
very
nice
man
and
then
there
s
major
seaforth
and
why
i
could
count
you
off
now
a
our
very
first
people
why
doctor
styles
doesn
t
think
so
and
i
m
sure
he
s
a
good
christian
doctor
styles
thinks
it
s
a
dispensation
for
giving
the
light
of
the
gospel
to
the
africans
why
now
i
m
sure
when
i
was
at
deacon
stebbins
i
stopped
over
sunday
once
cause
miss
stebbins
she
was
weakly
twas
when
she
was
getting
up
after
samuel
was
born
no
on
the
whole
i
believe
twas
nehemiah
cause
i
remember
he
had
curly
hair
but
any
way
i
remember
i
stayed
there
and
i
remember
as
plain
as
if
twas
yesterday
just
after
breakfast
how
a
man
went
driving
by
in
a
chaise
and
the
deacon
he
went
out
and
stopped
him
for
travelling
on
the
lord
s
day
cause
you
know
he
was
a
justice
of
the
peace
and
who
should
it
be
but
tom
seaforth
and
he
told
the
deacon
his
father
had
got
a
shipload
of
negroes
just
come
in
and
the
deacon
he
just
let
him
go
cause
i
remember
he
said
was
a
plain
work
of
necessity
and
mercy
a
well
now
who
would
have
thought
it
i
believe
the
doctor
is
better
than
most
folks
but
then
the
best
people
may
be
mistaken
you
the
doctor
has
made
up
his
mind
that
it
s
his
duty
said
scudder
i
m
afraid
it
ll
make
him
very
unpopular
but
i
for
one
shall
stand
by
oh
certainly
miss
scudder
you
re
doing
just
right
exactly
well
there
s
one
comfort
he
ll
have
a
great
crowd
to
hear
him
preach
cause
as
i
was
going
round
through
the
entries
last
night
i
heard
em
talking
about
it
and
colonel
burr
said
he
should
be
there
and
so
did
the
general
and
so
did
what
there
that
senator
from
philadelphia
i
tell
you
you
ll
have
a
full
it
was
to
be
confessed
that
scudder
s
heart
rather
sank
than
otherwise
at
this
announcement
and
those
who
have
felt
what
it
is
to
be
almost
alone
in
the
right
in
the
face
of
all
the
first
families
of
their
acquaintance
may
perhaps
find
some
compassion
for
her
since
after
all
truth
is
invisible
but
first
families
are
very
evident
first
families
are
often
very
agreeable
undeniably
virtuous
and
it
takes
great
faith
to
resist
an
evil
principle
which
incarnates
itself
in
the
suavities
of
their
breeding
and
amiability
and
therefore
it
was
that
scudder
felt
her
heart
heavy
within
her
and
could
with
a
very
good
grace
have
joined
the
doctor
s
saturday
fast
as
for
the
doctor
he
sat
the
while
tranquil
in
his
study
with
his
great
bible
and
his
concordance
open
before
him
culling
with
that
patient
assiduity
for
which
he
was
remarkable
all
the
terrible
texts
which
that
very
unceremonious
and
book
rains
down
so
unsparingly
on
the
sin
of
oppressing
the
weak
first
families
whether
in
newport
or
elsewhere
were
as
invisible
to
him
as
they
were
to
moses
during
the
forty
days
that
he
spent
with
god
on
the
mount
he
was
merely
thinking
of
his
message
thinking
only
how
he
should
shape
it
so
as
not
to
leave
one
word
of
it
unsaid
not
even
imagining
in
the
least
what
the
result
of
it
was
to
be
he
was
but
a
voice
but
an
instrument
passive
instrument
through
which
an
almighty
will
was
to
reveal
itself
and
the
sublime
fatalism
of
his
faith
made
him
as
dead
to
all
human
considerations
as
if
he
had
been
a
portion
of
the
immutable
laws
of
nature
herself
so
the
next
morning
although
all
his
friends
trembled
for
him
when
he
rose
in
the
pulpit
he
never
thought
of
trembling
for
himself
he
had
come
in
the
covered
way
of
silence
from
the
secret
place
of
the
most
high
and
felt
himself
still
abiding
under
the
shadow
of
the
almighty
it
was
alike
to
him
whether
the
house
was
full
or
empty
whoever
were
decreed
to
hear
the
message
would
be
there
whether
they
would
hear
or
forbear
was
already
settled
in
the
counsels
of
a
mightier
will
than
his
he
had
the
simple
duty
of
utterance
the
ruinous
old
was
never
so
radiant
with
station
and
gentility
as
on
that
morning
a
june
sun
shone
brightly
the
sea
sparkled
with
a
thousand
little
eyes
the
birds
sang
all
along
the
way
and
all
the
notables
turned
out
to
hear
the
doctor
scudder
received
into
her
pew
with
dignified
politeness
colonel
burr
and
colonel
and
madame
de
frontignac
general
wilcox
and
his
portly
dame
major
seaforth
and
we
know
not
what
not
of
vernons
and
de
wolfs
and
other
grand
old
names
were
present
there
stiff
silks
rustled
chinese
fans
fluttered
and
the
last
court
fashion
stood
revealed
in
bonnets
everybody
was
looking
fresh
and
amiable
a
charming
and
respectable
set
of
sinners
come
to
hear
what
the
doctor
would
find
to
tell
them
about
their
transgressions
scudder
was
calculating
consequences
and
shutting
her
eyes
on
the
too
evident
world
about
her
prayed
that
the
lord
would
overrule
all
for
good
the
doctor
prayed
that
he
might
have
grace
to
speak
the
truth
and
the
whole
truth
we
have
yet
on
record
in
his
published
works
the
great
argument
of
that
day
through
which
he
moved
with
that
calm
appeal
to
the
reason
which
made
his
results
always
so
weighty
if
these
things
be
true
he
said
after
a
condensed
statement
of
the
facts
of
the
case
then
the
following
terrible
consequences
which
may
well
make
all
shudder
and
tremble
who
realize
them
force
themselves
upon
us
that
all
who
have
had
any
hand
in
this
iniquitous
business
whether
directly
or
indirectly
or
have
used
their
influence
to
promote
it
or
have
consented
to
it
or
even
connived
at
it
or
have
not
opposed
it
by
all
proper
exertions
of
which
they
are
these
are
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
chargeable
with
the
injuries
and
miseries
which
millions
have
suffered
and
are
suffering
and
are
guilty
of
the
blood
of
millions
who
lost
their
lives
by
this
traffic
in
the
human
species
not
only
the
merchants
who
have
been
engaged
in
this
trade
and
the
captains
who
have
been
tempted
by
the
love
of
money
to
engage
in
this
cruel
work
and
the
slaveholders
of
every
description

guilty
of
shedding
rivers
of
blood
but
all
the
legislatures
who
have
authorized
encouraged

neglected
to
suppress
it
to
the

of
their
power

all

went
over
the
recent
history
of
the
country
expatiated
on
the
national
declaration
so
lately
made
that
all
men
are
born
equally
free

independent

and

and
asked
with
what
face

declaring
such
things
could
continue
to
hold
thousands
of
their
in
abject
slavery
he
pointed
out
signs
of
national
disaster
which
foreboded
the
wrath
of
heaven
the
increase
of
public
and
private
debts
the
spirit
of
murmuring
and
jealousy
of
rulers
among
the

divisions
and
contentions
and
bitter

and
making

evident
tokens
of
the
displeasure
and
impending
judgment
of
an
offended
justice
the
sermon
rolled
over
the
heads
of
the
gay
audience
deep
and
dark
as
a
which
in
a
few
moments
changes
a
summer
sky
into
heaviest
gloom
gradually
an
expression
of
intense
interest
and
deep
concern
spread
over
the
listeners
it
was
the
magnetism
of
a
strong
mind
which
held
them
for
a
time
under
the
shadow
of
his
own
awful
sense
of
god
s
almighty
justice
it
is
said
that
a
little
child
once
described
his
appearance
in
the
pulpit
by
saying
i
saw
god
there
and
i
was
something
of
the
same
effect
was
produced
on
the
audience
now
and
it
was
not
till
after
sermon
prayer
and
benediction
were
all
over
that
the
respectables
of
newport
began
gradually
to
unstiffen
themselves
from
the
spell
and
to
look
into
each
other
s
eyes
for
comfort
and
to
reassure
themselves
that
after
all
they
were
the
first
families
eminently
respectable
and
going
on
in
the
good
old
way
the
world
had
always
gone
and
that
the
doctor
of
course
was
a
radical
and
a
fanatic
when
the
audience
streamed
out
crowding
the
broad
aisle
mary
descended
from
the
singers
seat
and
stood
with
her
psalm
book
in
hand
waiting
at
the
door
to
be
joined
by
her
mother
and
the
doctor
she
overheard
many
hard
words
from
people
who
an
evening
or
two
before
had
smiled
so
graciously
upon
them
it
was
therefore
with
no
little
determination
of
manner
that
she
advanced
and
took
the
doctor
s
arm
as
if
anxious
to
associate
herself
with
his
unpopularity
and
just
at
this
moment
she
caught
the
eye
and
smile
of
colonel
burr
as
he
bowed
gracefully
yet
not
without
a
suggestion
of
something
sarcastic
in
his
eye

we

the
heroine
of

among

has
a
prescriptive
right
to

as

she
appears
like

not
without
this
luxury

to
its
sacred
precincts
we
will
give
you
this
morning
a
ticket
of
admission
know
then
that
the
garret
of
this
cottage
had
a
projecting
window
on
the
seaward
side
which
opened
into
an
immensely
large
old
and
was
a
as
leafy
and
secluded
as
a
robin
s
nest
garrets
are
delicious
places
in
any
case
for
people
of
thoughtful
imaginative
temperament
who
has
not
loved
a
garret
in
the
twilight
days
of
childhood
with
its
endless
stores
of
quaint
suggestive
antiquity
chests
chairs
and
casks
full
of
old
comminglings
out
of
which
with
tiny
childish
hands
we
fished
wonderful
hoards
of
fairy
treasure
what
and
and
undiscoverable
retreats
we
made
to
ourselves
we
sat
rejoicing
in
our
security
and
bidding
defiance
to
the
vague
distant
cry
which
summoned
us
to
school
or
to
some
unsavoury
task
how
deliciously
the
rain
came
pattering
on
the
roof
over
head
or
the
red
twilight
streamed
in
at
the
window
while
we
sat
snugly
ensconced
over
the
delicious
pages
of
some
romance
which
careful
aunts
had
packed
away
at
the
bottom
of
all
things
to
be
sure
we
should
never
read
it
if
you
have
anything
beloved
friends
which
you
wish
your
charlie
or
your
susie
to
be
sure
and
read
pack
it
mysteriously
away
at
the
bottom
of
a
trunk
of
stimulating
rubbish
in
the
darkest
corner
of
your
garret

case
if
the
book
be
at
all
readable
one
that
by
any
possible
chance
can
make
its
way
into
a
young
mind
you
may
be
sure
that
it
will
not
only
be
read
but
remembered
to
the
longest
day
they
have
to
live
katy
scudder
s
garret
was
not
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
those
quaint
little
people
who
touch
with
so
airy
a
grace
all
the
lights
and
shadows
of
great
beams
bare
rafters
and
unplastered
walls
had
not
failed
in
their
work
there
was
there
not
there
a
grand
of
minus
two
of
its
hinder
legs
which
had
genealogical
associations
through
the
wilcoxes
with
the
vernons
and
through
the
vernons
quite
across
the
water
with
old
england
and
was
there
not
a
dusky
picture
in
an
old
tarnished
frame
of
a
woman
of
whose
tragic
end
strange
stories
were
whispered
of
the
sufferers
in
the
time
when
witches
were
unceremoniously
helped
out
of
the
world
instead
of
being
as
helped
to
make
their
fortune
in
it
by
yes
there
were
all
these
things
and
many
more
which
we
will
not
stay
to
recount
but
bring
you
to
the
boudoir
which
mary
has
constructed
for
herself
around
the
which
looks
into
the
whispering
old
the
enclosure
was
formed
by
blankets
and
which
by
reason
of
their
antiquity
had
been
pensioned
off
to
an
undisturbed
old
age
in
the
garret
blankets
or
either
as
you
buy
yours
out
of
a
shop
or
woven
by
machinery
individuality
or
history
every
one
of
these
curtains
had
its
story
the
one
on
the
right
nearest
the
window
and
already
falling
into
holes
is
a
chinese
linen
and
even
now
displays
unfaded
quaint
patterns
of
chinamen
in
conical
hats
standing
on
the
leaves
of
most
singular
herbage
and
with
hands
for
ever
raised
in
act
to
strike
bells
which
never
are
struck
and
never
will
be
till
the
end
of
time
these
katy
scudder
had
often
instructed
mary
were
brought
from
the
indies
by
her
and
were
her
grandmother
s
grandmother
who
had
blue
eyes
like
hers
and
was
just
about
her
height
the
next
spread
was
spun
and
woven
by
katy
s
beloved
aunt
eunice
mythical
personage
of
whom
mary
gathered
vague
accounts
that
she
was
disappointed
in
love
and
that
this
very
article
was
part
of
a
bridal
outfit
prepared
in
vain
against
the
return
of
one
from
sea
who
never
came
back
she
heard
of
how
she
sat
wearily
and
patiently
at
her
work
this
poor
aunt
eunice
month
after
month
starting
every
time
she
heard
the
gate
shut
every
time
she
heard
the
tramp
of
a
horse
s
hoof
every
time
she
heard
the
news
of
a
sail
in
sight
colour
meanwhile
fading
and
fading
as
life
and
hope
bled
away
at
an
inward
wound
at
last
she
found
comfort
and
reunion
beyond
the
veil
next
to
this
was
a
pieced
in
tiny
blocks
none
of
them
bigger
than
a
sixpence
containing
as
katy
said
pieces
of
the
gowns
of
all
her
grandmothers
aunts
cousins
and
female
relatives
for
years
back
mated
to
it
was
one
of
the
blankets
which
had
served
scudder
s
uncle
in
his
bivouac
at
valley
forge
when
the
american
soldiers
went
on
the
snows
with
bleeding
feet
and
had
scarce
anything
for
daily
bread
except
a
morning
message
of
patriotism
and
hope
from
george
washington
such
were
the
memories
woven
into
the
tapestry
of
our
little
boudoir
within
fronting
the
window
stands
the
large
one
end
adorned
with
a
snowy
pile
of
fleecy
rolls
beside
it
a
reel
and
a
basket
of
skeins
of
yarn
open
with
its
face
down
on
the
beam
of
the
wheel
lay
always
a
book
with
which
the
intervals
of
work
were
beguiled
the
dusky
picture
of
which
we
have
spoken
hung
against
the
rough
wall
in
one
place
and
in
another
appeared
an
old
engraved
head
of
one
of
the
madonnas
of
leonardo
da
vinci
a
picture
which
to
mary
had
a
mysterious
interest
from
the
fact
of
its
having
been
cast
on
shore
after
a
furious
storm
and
found
like
a
waif
lying
in
the
and
marvyn
who
had
deciphered
the
signature
had
not
ceased
exploring
till
she
found
for
her
in
an
encyclopædia
a
life
of
that
wonderful
man
whose
greatness
enlarges
our
ideas
of
what
is
possible
to
humanity
mary
pondering
thereon
felt
the
picture
as
a
constant
vague
inspiration
here
our
heroine
spun
for
hours
and
hours
with
intervals
when
crouched
on
a
low
seat
in
the
window
she
pored
over
her
book
and
then
returning
again
to
her
work
thought
of
what
she
had
read
to
the
lulling
burr
of
the
sounding
wheel
by
chance
a
robin
had
built
its
nest
so
that
from
her
retreat
she
could
see
the
five
little
blue
eggs
whenever
the
patient
brooding
mother
left
them
for
a
moment
uncovered
and
sometimes
as
she
sat
in
dreamy
reverie
resting
her
small
round
arms
on
the
she
fancied
that
the
little
feathered
watcher
gave
her
familiar
nods
and
winks
of
a
confidential
nature
the
small
head
first
to
one
side
and
then
to
the
other
to
get
a
better
view
of
her
gentle
human
neighbour
i
dare
say
it
seems
to
you
reader
that
we
have
travelled
in
our
story
over
a
long
space
of
time
because
we
have
talked
so
much
and
introduced
so
many
personages
and
reflections
but
in
fact
it
is
only
wednesday
week
since
james
sailed
and
the
eggs
which
were
brooded
when
he
went
are
still
unhatched
in
the
nest
and
the
has
changed
only
in
having
now
a
majority
of
white
blossoms
over
the
pink
buds
this
one
week
has
been
a
critical
one
to
our
mary
in
it
she
has
made
the
great
discovery
that
she
loves
and
she
has
made
her
first
step
into
the
gay
world
and
now
she
comes
back
to
her
retirement
to
think
the
whole
over
by
herself
it
seems
a
dream
to
her
that
she
who
sits
there
now
reeling
yarn
in
her
stuff
petticoat
and
white
is
the
same
who
took
the
arm
of
colonel
burr
amid
the
blaze
of
and
the
sweep
of
silks
and
rustle
of
plumes
she
wonders
dreamily
as
she
remembers
the
dark
lovely
face
of
the
foreign
madame
so
brilliant
under
its
powdered
hair
and
flashing
gems
sweet
foreign
accents
of
the
voice
tiny
jewelled
fan
with
its
glancing
pictures
and
sparkling
tassels
whence
exhaled
vague
and
floating
perfumes
then
she
hears
again
that
manly
voice
softened
to
tones
so
seductive
and
sees
those
fine
eyes
with
the
tears
in
them
and
wonders
within
herself
that
could
have
kissed
her
hand
with
such
veneration
as
if
she
had
been
a
throned
queen
but
here
the
sound
of
busy
pattering
footsteps
is
heard
on
the
old
creaking
staircase
and
soon
the
bows
of
miss
prissy
s
bonnet
part
the
folds
of
the
boudoir
drapery
and
her
merry
face
looks
in
well
really
mary
how
do
you
do
to
be
sure
you
wonder
to
see
me
don
t
you
but
i
thought
i
must
just
run
in
a
minute
on
my
way
up
to
miss
marvyn
s
i
promised
her
at
least
a
half
a
day
though
i
didn
t
see
how
i
was
to
spare
it
i
tell
miss
wilcox
i
just
run
and
run
till
it
does
seem
as
if
my
feet
would
drop
off
but
i
thought
i
must
just
step
in
to
say
that
i
for
my
part
the
doctor
more
than
ever
and
i
was
telling
your
mother
we
mus
n
t
mind
too
much
what
people
say
i
most
made
miss
wilcox
angry
standing
up
for
him
but
i
put
it
right
to
her
and
says
i
miss
wilcox
you
know
folks
speak
what
s
on
their
mind
particular
ministers
must
and
you
know
miss
wilcox
i
says
that
the
doctor
a
good
man
and
lives
up
to
his
teaching
if
anybody
in
this
world
does
and
gives
away
every
dollar
he
can
lay
hands
on
to
those
poor
negroes
and
works
over
em
and
teaches
em
as
if
they
were
his
brothers
and
says
i
miss
wilcox
you
know
i
don
t
spare
myself
night
nor
day
trying
to
please
you
and
do
your
work
to
give
satisfaction
but
when
it
comes
to
my
conscience
says
i
miss
wilcox
you
know
i
always
must
speak
out
and
if
it
was
the
last
word
i
had
to
say
on
my
dying
bed
i
d
say
that
i
think
the
doctor
is
why
what
things
he
told
about
the
and
packing
those
poor
creatures
so
that
they
couldn
t
move
nor
breathe
i
declare
every
time
i
turned
over
and
stretched
in
bed
i
thought
of
it
and
says
i
miss
wilcox
i
do
believe
that
the
judgments
of
god
will
come
down
on
us
if
something
a
n
t
done
and
i
shall
always
stand
by
the
doctor
says
i
if
you
ll
believe
me
just
then
i
turned
round
and
saw
the
general
and
the
general
he
just
right
out
and
says
he
good
for
you
miss
prissy
that
s
real
grit
says
he
and
i
like
you
better
for
laws
added
miss
prissy
reflectively
i
sha
n
t
lose
by
it
for
miss
wilcox
knows
she
never
can
get
anybody
to
do
the
work
for
her
that
i
do
you
think
said
mary
that
there
are
a
great
many
made
angry
why
bless
your
heart
child
haven
t
you
heard
why
there
never
was
such
a
talk
in
all
newport
why
you
know
simeon
brown
is
gone
clear
off
to
doctor
stiles
and
miss
brown
i
was
making
up
her
satin
a
monday
and
you
ought
to
a
heard
her
talk
but
i
tell
you
i
fought
her
she
used
to
talk
to
me
said
miss
prissy
sinking
her
voice
to
a
mysterious
whisper
cause
i
never
could
come
to
it
to
say
that
i
was
willin
to
be
lost
if
it
was
for
the
glory
of
god
and
she
always
told
me
folks
could
just
bring
their
minds
right
up
to
anything
they
knew
they
must
and
i
just
got
the
tables
turned
on
her
for
they
talked
and
abused
the
doctor
till
they
fairly
wore
me
out
and
says
i
well
miss
brown
i
ll
give
in
that
you
and
brown
act
up
to
your
principles
you
certainly
as
if
you
were
willing
to
be
damned
so
do
all
those
folks
who
will
live
on
the
blood
and
groans
of
the
poor
africans
as
the
doctor
said
and
i
should
think
by
the
way
newport
people
are
making
their
money
that
they
were
all
pretty
willing
to
go
that
way
though
whether
it
s
for
the
glory
of
god
or
not
i
m
doubting
but
you
see
mary
said
miss
prissy
sinking
her
voice
again
to
a
solemn
whisper
i
never
was
on
that
point
it
always
did
seem
to
me
a
dreadful
high
place
to
come
to
and
it
didn
t
seem
to
be
given
to
me
but
i
thought
perhaps
if
it
necessary
it
would
be
given
you
know
the
lord
always
has
been
so
good
to
me
that
i
ve
faith
to
believe
that
and
so
i
just
say
the
lord
is
my
shepherd
i
shall
not
want
miss
prissy
hastily
whisked
a
little
drop
out
of
her
blue
eye
with
her
handkerchief
at
this
moment
scudder
came
into
the
boudoir
with
a
face
expressive
of
some
anxiety
i
suppose
miss
prissy
has
told
you
she
said
the
news
about
the
browns
that
ll
make
a
great
falling
off
in
the
doctor
s
salary
and
i
feel
for
him
because
i
know
it
will
come
hard
to
him
not
to
be
able
to
help
and
do
especially
for
these
poor
negroes
just
when
he
will
but
then
we
must
put
everything
on
the
most
economical
scale
we
can
and
just
try
all
of
us
to
make
it
up
to
him
i
was
speaking
to
cousin
zebedee
about
it
when
he
was
down
here
on
monday
and
he
is
all
clear
has
made
out
three
papers
for
candace
and
cato
and
dinah
and
they
couldn
t
one
of
em
be
hired
to
leave
him
and
he
says
from
what
he
s
seen
already
he
has
no
doubt
but
they
ll
do
enough
more
to
pay
for
their
well
said
miss
prissy
i
haven
t
got
anybody
to
care
for
but
myself
i
was
telling
sister
elizabeth
one
time
she
s
married
and
got
four
children
that
i
could
take
a
storm
a
good
deal
easier
than
she
could
cause
i
hadn
t
near
so
many
sails
to
pull
down
and
now
you
just
look
to
me
for
the
doctor
s
shirts
cause
after
this
they
shall
all
come
in
ready
to
put
on
if
i
have
to
sit
up
till
morning
and
i
hope
miss
scudder
you
can
trust
me
to
make
them
for
if
i
do
say
it
myself
i
a
n
t
afraid
to
do
fine
stitching
longside
of
anybody
hemstitching
ruffles
too
and
i
haven
t
shown
you
yet
that
french
stitch
i
learned
of
the
nuns
you
just
set
your
heart
at
rest
about
the
doctor
s
shirts
i
always
thought
continued
miss
prissy
laughing
that
i
should
have
made
a
famous
hand
about
getting
up
that
tabernacle
in
the
wilderness
with
the
blue
and
the
purple
and
linen
it
s
one
of
my
favourite
passages
that
is
things
you
know
are
useful
to
different
well
said
scudder
i
see
that
it
s
our
call
to
be
a
remnant
small
and
despised
but
i
hope
we
sha
n
t
shrink
from
it
i
thought
when
i
saw
all
those
fashionable
people
go
out
sunday
tossing
their
heads
and
looking
so
scornful
that
i
hoped
grace
would
be
given
me
to
be
and
what
does
the
doctor
say
said
miss
prissy
he
hasn
t
said
a
word
his
mind
seems
to
be
very
much
lifted
above
all
these
la
yes
said
miss
prissy
that
s
one
comfort
he
ll
never
know
where
his
shirts
come
from
and
besides
that
miss
scudder
she
said
sinking
her
voice
to
a
whisper
as
you
know
i
haven
t
any
children
to
provide
for
i
was
telling
elizabeth
t
other
day
when
i
was
making
up
frocks
for
her
children
that
i
believed
old
maids
first
and
last
did
more
providing
for
children
than
married
women
but
still
i
do
contrive
to
slip
away
a
now
and
then
in
my
little
old
silver
teapot
that
was
given
to
me
when
they
settled
old
simpson
s
property
i
nursed
her
all
through
her
last
sickness
and
laid
her
out
with
my
own
hands
and
as
i
was
saying
if
ever
the
doctor
should
want
money
you
just
let
me
thank
you
miss
prissy
said
scudder
we
all
know
where
your
heart
and
now
added
miss
prissy
what
do
you
suppose
they
say
why
they
say
colonel
burr
is
struck
dead
in
love
with
our
mary
and
you
know
his
wife
s
dead
and
he
s
a
widower
and
they
do
say
that
he
ll
get
to
be
the
next
president
sakes
alive
well
mary
must
be
careful
if
she
don
t
want
to
be
carried
off
for
they
do
say
that
there
can
t
any
woman
resist
him
that
sees
enough
of
him
why
there
s
that
poor
frenchwoman
madame
what
do
you
call
her
that
s
staying
with
the
vernons
say
she
s
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
but
she
s
a
married
woman
said
mary
it
can
t
be
possible
scudder
looked
reprovingly
at
miss
prissy
and
for
a
few
moments
there
was
great
shaking
of
heads
and
a
whispered
conference
between
the
two
ladies
ending
in
miss
prissy
s
going
off
saying
as
she
went
down
stairs
well
if
women
will
do
so
i
for
my
part
can
t
blame
the
in
a
few
moments
miss
prissy
rushed
back
as
much
discomposed
as
a
clucking
hen
who
has
seen
a
hawk
well
miss
scudder
what
do
you
think
here
s
colonel
burr
come
to
call
on
the
ladies
scudder
s
first
movement
in
common
with
all
gentlewomen
was
to
put
her
hand
to
her
head
and
reflect
that
she
had
not
on
her
best
cap
and
mary
looked
down
at
her
dimpled
hands
which
were
blue
from
the
contact
with
mixed
yarn
she
had
just
been
spinning
now
i
ll
tell
you
what
said
miss
prissy
wasn
t
it
lucky
you
had
me
here
for
i
first
saw
him
coming
in
at
the
gate
and
i
whipped
in
quick
as
a
wink
and
opened
the
best
room
and
then
i
was
back
at
the
door
and
he
bowed
to
me
as
if
i
d
been
a
queen
and
says
he
miss
prissy
how
fresh
you
re
looking
this
morning
you
see
i
was
in
working
at
the
vernons
but
i
never
thought
as
he
d
noticed
me
and
then
he
inquired
in
the
handsomest
way
for
the
ladies
and
the
doctor
and
so
i
took
him
into
the
parlour
and
settled
him
down
and
then
i
ran
into
the
study
and
you
may
depend
upon
it
i
flew
round
lively
for
a
few
minutes
i
got
the
doctor
s
off
and
got
his
best
coat
on
and
put
on
his
wig
for
him
and
started
him
up
kinder
lively
know
it
takes
me
to
get
him
down
into
this
world
so
there
he
s
in
talking
with
him
and
so
you
can
just
slip
down
and
dress
yourselves
as
meanwhile
colonel
burr
was
entertaining
the
doctor
with
all
the
grace
of
a
young
neophyte
come
to
sit
at
the
feet
of
superior
truth
there
are
some
people
who
receive
from
nature
as
a
gift
a
sort
of
graceful
facility
of
sympathy
by
which
they
incline
to
take
on
for
the
time
being
the
sentiments
and
opinions
of
those
with
whom
they
converse
as
the
chameleon
was
fabled
to
change
its
hue
with
every
surrounding
such
are
often
supposed
to
be
wilfully
acting
a
part
as
exerting
themselves
to
flatter
and
deceive
when
in
fact
they
are
only
framed
so
sensitive
to
the
sphere
of
mental
emanation
which
surrounds
others
that
it
would
require
an
exertion
in
some
measure
to
harmonize
with
it
in
approaching
others
in
conversation
they
are
like
a
musician
who
joins
a
performer
on
an
instrument
is
impossible
for
them
to
strike
a
discord
their
very
nature
urges
them
to
bring
into
play
faculties
according
in
vibration
with
those
which
another
is
exerting
it
was
as
natural
as
possible
for
burr
to
commence
talking
with
the
doctor
on
scenes
and
incidents
in
the
family
of
president
edwards
and
his
old
tutor
bellamy
thence
to
glide
on
to
the
points
of
difference
and
agreement
in
theology
with
a
suavity
and
deference
which
acted
on
the
good
man
like
a
june
sun
on
a
budding
the
doctor
was
soon
wide
awake
talking
with
fervent
animation
on
the
topic
of
disinterested
benevolence
the
meanwhile
studying
him
with
the
quiet
interest
of
an
observer
of
natural
history
who
sees
a
new
species
developing
before
him
at
all
the
best
possible
points
he
interposed
suggestive
questions
and
set
up
objections
in
the
quietest
manner
for
the
doctor
to
knock
down
smiling
ever
the
while
as
a
man
may
who
truly
and
genuinely
does
not
care
a
for
truth
on
any
subject
not
practically
connected
with
his
own
schemes
in
life
he
therefore
gently
guided
the
doctor
to
sail
down
the
stream
of
his
own
thoughts
till
his
bark
glided
out
into
the
smooth
waters
of
the
millennium
on
which
with
great
simplicity
he
gave
his
views
at
length
it
was
just
in
the
midst
of
this
that
mary
and
her
mother
entered
burr
interrupted
the
conversation
to
pay
them
the
compliments
of
the
morning
inquire
for
their
health
and
hope
they
suffered
no
inconvenience
from
their
night
ride
from
the
party
then
seeing
the
doctor
still
looking
eager
to
go
on
he
contrived
with
gentle
dexterity
to
tie
again
the
broken
thread
of
conversation
our
excellent
friend
he
said
was
explaining
to
me
his
views
of
a
future
millennium
i
assure
you
ladies
that
we
sometimes
find
ourselves
in
company
which
enables
us
to
believe
in
the
perfectibility
of
the
human
species
we
see
family
retreats
so
unaffected
so
charming
in
their
simplicity
where
industry
and
piety
so
go
hand
in
hand
one
has
only
to
suppose
all
families
such
to
imagine
a
millennium
there
was
no
disclaiming
this
compliment
because
so
delicately
worded
that
while
perfectly
clear
to
the
internal
sense
it
was
in
a
manner
veiled
and
unspoken
meanwhile
the
doctor
who
sat
ready
to
begin
where
he
left
off
turned
to
his
complaisant
listener
and
resumed
an
exposition
of
the
apocalypse
to
my
mind
it
is
certain
he
said
as
it
is
now
three
hundred
years
since
the
fifth
vial
was
poured
out
there
is
good
reason
to
suppose
that
the
sixth
vial
began
to
be
poured
out
at
the
beginning
of
the
last
century
and
has
been
running
for
a
hundred
years
or
more
so
that
it
is
run
nearly
out
the
seventh
and
last
vial
will
begin
to
run
early
in
the
next
you
anticipate
then
no
rest
for
the
world
for
some
time
to
come
said
burr
certainly
not
said
the
doctor
definitively
there
will
be
no
rest
from
overturnings
till
he
whose
right
it
is
shall
the
passage
he
added
concerning
the
drying
up
of
the
river
euphrates
under
the
sixth
vial
has
a
distinct
reference
i
think
to
the
account
in
ancient
writers
of
the
taking
of
babylon
and
prefigures
in
like
manner
that
the
resources
of
that
modern
babylon
the
popish
power
shall
continue
to
be
drained
off
as
they
have
now
been
drying
up
for
a
century
or
more
till
at
last
there
will
come
a
sudden
and
final
downfall
of
that
power
and
after
that
will
come
the
first
triumphs
of
truth
and
righteousness
of
the
these
investigations
must
undoubtedly
possess
a
deep
interest
for
you
sir
said
burr
the
hope
of
a
future
as
well
as
the
tradition
of
a
past
age
of
gold
seems
to
have
been
one
of
the
most
cherished
conceptions
of
the
human
in
those
times
continued
the
doctor
the
whole
earth
will
be
of
one
which
language
sir
do
you
suppose
will
be
considered
worthy
of
such
inquired
his
listener
that
will
probably
be
decided
by
an
amicable
conference
of
all
nations
said
the
doctor
and
the
one
universally
considered
most
valuable
will
be
adopted
and
the
literature
of
all
other
nations
being
translated
into
it
they
will
gradually
drop
all
other
tongues
brother
stiles
thinks
it
will
be
the
hebrew
i
am
not
clear
on
that
point
the
hebrew
seems
to
me
too
inflexible
and
not
sufficiently
copious
i
do
not
think
he
added
after
some
consideration
that
it
will
be
the
hebrew
i
am
most
happy
to
hear
it
sir
said
burr
gravely
i
never
felt
much
attracted
to
that
language
but
ladies
he
added
starting
up
with
animation
i
must
improve
this
fine
weather
to
ask
you
to
show
me
the
view
of
the
sea
from
this
little
hill
beyond
your
house
it
is
evidently
so
fine
trust
i
am
not
intruding
too
far
on
your
morning
by
no
means
sir
said
scudder
rising
we
will
go
with
you
in
a
and
soon
colonel
burr
with
one
on
either
arm
was
to
be
seen
on
the
top
of
the
hill
beyond
the
house
very
one
from
which
mary
the
week
before
had
seen
the
retreating
sail
we
all
wot
of
hence
though
her
companion
contrived
with
the
adroitness
of
a
practised
man
of
gallantry
to
direct
his
words
and
looks
as
constantly
to
her
as
if
they
had
been
in
a
and
although
nothing
could
be
more
graceful
more
delicately
flattering
more
engaging
still
the
little
heart
kept
equal
poise
for
where
a
true
love
has
once
bolted
the
door
a
false
one
serenades
in
vain
under
the
window
some
fine
instinctive
perceptions
of
the
real
character
of
the
man
beside
her
seemed
to
have
dawned
on
mary
s
mind
in
the
conversation
of
the
morning
had
felt
the
covert
and
subtile
irony
that
lurked
beneath
his
polished
smile
felt
the
utter
want
of
faith
or
sympathy
in
what
she
and
her
revered
friend
deemed
holiest
and
therefore
there
was
a
calm
dignity
in
her
manner
of
receiving
his
attentions
which
rather
piqued
and
stimulated
his
curiosity
he
had
been
wont
to
boast
that
he
could
subdue
any
woman
if
he
could
only
see
enough
of
her
in
the
first
interview
in
the
garden
he
had
made
her
colour
come
and
go
and
brought
tears
to
her
eyes
in
a
manner
that
interested
his
fancy
and
he
could
not
resist
the
impulse
to
experiment
again
it
was
a
new
sensation
to
him
to
find
himself
quietly
studied
and
calmly
measured
by
those
thoughtful
blue
eyes
he
felt
with
his
fine
instinctive
tact
that
the
soul
within
was
enfolded
in
some
crystalline
sphere
of
protection
transparent
but
adamantine
so
that
he
could
not
touch
it
what
was
that
secret
poise
that
calm
immutable
centre
on
which
she
rested
that
made
her
in
her
rustic
simplicity
so
unapproachable
and
so
strong
burr
remembered
once
finding
in
his
grandfather
s
study
among
a
mass
of
old
letters
one
in
which
that
great
man
in
early
youth
described
his
future
wife
then
known
to
him
only
by
distant
report
with
his
keen
natural
sense
of
everything
fine
and
poetic
he
had
been
struck
with
this
passage
as
so
beautifully
expressing
an
ideal
womanhood
that
he
had
in
his
earlier
days
copied
it
in
his
private
they
say
it
ran
that
there
is
a
young
lady
who
is
beloved
of
that
great
being
who
made
and
rules
the
world
and
that
there
are
certain
seasons
in
which
this
great
being
in
some
way
or
other
invisible
comes
to
her
and
fills
her
mind
with
such
exceeding
sweet
delight
that
she
hardly
cares
for
anything
except
to
meditate
on
him
that
she
expects
after
a
while
to
be
received
up
where
he
is
to
be
raised
up
out
of
the
world
and
caught
up
into
heaven
being
assured
that
he
loves
her
too
well
to
let
her
remain
at
a
distance
from
him
always
therefore
if
you
present
all
the
world
before
her
with
the
richest
of
its
treasures
she
disregards
it
she
has
a
strange
sweetness
in
her
mind
and
singular
purity
in
her
affections
and
you
could
not
persuade
her
to
do
anything
wrong
or
sinful
if
you
should
give
her
all
the
world
she
is
of
a
wonderful
sweetness
calmness
and
universal
benevolence
of
mind
especially
after
this
great
god
has
manifested
himself
to
her
mind
she
will
sometimes
go
from
place
to
place
singing
sweetly
and
seems
to
be
always
full
of
joy
and
pleasure
and
no
one
knows
for
what
she
loves
to
be
alone
walking
in
fields
and
groves
and
seems
to
have
some
invisible
one
always
conversing
with
a
shadowy
recollection
of
this
description
crossed
his
mind
more
than
once
as
he
looked
into
those
calm
and
candid
eyes
was
there
then
a
truth
in
that
inner
union
of
chosen
souls
with
god
of
which
his
mother
and
her
mother
before
her
had
borne
meek
witness
souls
shining
out
as
sacred
lamps
through
the
alabaster
walls
of
a
temple
but
then
again
had
he
not
logically
met
and
demonstrated
to
his
own
satisfaction
the
nullity
of
the
religious
dogmas
on
which
new
england
faith
was
based
there
could
be
no
such
inner
life
he
said
to
himself
had
demonstrated
it
as
an
absurdity
what
was
it
then
charm
so
subtile
and
so
strong
by
which
this
fair
child
his
inferior
in
age
cultivation
and
knowledge
of
the
world
held
him
in
a
certain
awe
and
made
him
feel
her
spirit
so
unapproachable
his
curiosity
was
piqued
he
felt
stimulated
to
employ
all
his
powers
of
pleasing
he
was
determined
that
sooner
or
later
she
should
feel
his
power
with
scudder
his
success
was
immediate
she
was
completely
won
over
by
the
deferential
manner
with
which
he
constantly
referred
himself
to
her
matronly
judgments
and
on
returning
to
the
house
she
warmly
pressed
him
to
stay
to
dinner
burr
accepted
the
invitation
with
a
frank
and
almost
boyish
declaring
that
he
had
not
seen
anything
for
years
that
so
reminded
him
of
old
times
he
praised
everything
at
table
smoking
brown
bread
the
baked
beans
steaming
from
the
oven
where
they
had
been
quietly
simmering
during
the
morning
walk
and
the
indian
pudding
with
its
gelatinous
softness
matured
by
long
and
patient
brooding
in
the
motherly
old
oven
he
declared
that
there
was
no
style
of
living
to
be
compared
with
the
simple
dignified
order
of
a
true
new
england
home
where
servants
were
excluded
and
everything
came
direct
from
the
polished
and
cultured
hand
of
a
lady
it
realized
the
dreams
of
arcadian
romance
a
man
he
declared
must
be
unworthy
the
name
who
did
not
rise
to
lofty
sentiments
and
heroic
deeds
when
even
his
animal
wants
were
provided
for
by
the
ministrations
of
the
most
delicate
and
exalted
portion
of
the
creation
after
dinner
he
would
be
taken
into
all
the
family
interests
gentle
and
pliable
as
oil
he
seemed
to
penetrate
every
joint
of
the
by
a
subtile
and
seductive
sympathy
he
was
interested
in
the
spinning
in
the
weaving
in
fact
nobody
knows
how
it
was
done
but
before
the
afternoon
shadows
had
turned
he
was
sitting
in
the
cracked
of
mary
s
gravely
giving
judgment
on
several
specimens
of
her
spinning
which
scudder
had
presented
to
his
notice
with
that
ease
with
which
he
could
at
will
glide
into
the
character
of
the
superior
and
elder
brother
he
had
without
seeming
to
ask
questions
drawn
from
mary
an
account
of
her
reading
her
studies
her
acquaintances
you
read
french
i
presume
he
said
to
her
with
easy
negligence
mary
coloured
deeply
and
then
as
one
who
recollects
one
s
self
answered
gravely
no
burr
i
know
no
language
but
my
but
you
should
learn
french
my
child
said
burr
with
that
gentle
dictatorship
which
he
could
at
times
so
gracefully
assume
i
should
be
delighted
to
learn
said
mary
but
have
no
yes
said
scudder
mary
has
always
had
a
taste
for
study
and
would
be
glad
to
improve
in
any
pardon
me
madam
if
i
take
the
liberty
of
making
a
suggestion
there
is
a
most
excellent
man
the
abbé
léfon
now
in
newport
driven
here
by
the
political
disturbances
in
france
he
is
anxious
to
obtain
a
few
scholars
and
i
am
interested
that
he
should
succeed
for
he
is
a
most
worthy
is
he
a
roman
catholic
he
is
madam
but
there
could
be
no
manner
of
danger
with
a
person
so
admirably
instructed
as
your
daughter
if
you
please
to
see
him
madam
i
will
call
with
him
some
mrs
marvyn
will
perhaps
join
me
said
mary
she
has
been
studying
french
by
herself
for
some
time
in
order
to
read
a
treatise
on
astronomy
which
she
found
in
that
language
i
will
go
over
and
see
her
about
before
colonel
burr
departed
the
doctor
requested
him
to
step
a
moment
with
him
into
his
study
burr
who
had
had
frequent
occasions
during
his
life
to
experience
the
sort
of
paternal
freedom
which
the
clergy
of
his
country
took
with
him
in
right
of
his
clerical
descent
began
to
summon
together
his
faculties
of
address
for
the
avoidance
of
a
kind
of
conversation
which
he
was
not
disposed
to
meet
he
was
agreeably
disappointed
however
when
taking
a
paper
from
the
table
and
presenting
it
to
him
the
doctor
said
i
feel
myself
my
dear
sir
under
a
burden
of
obligation
for
benefits
received
from
your
family
so
that
i
never
see
a
member
of
it
without
casting
about
in
my
own
mind
how
i
may
in
some
measure
express
my
towards
him
you
are
aware
that
the
papers
of
your
distinguished
grandfather
have
fallen
into
my
hands
and
from
them
i
have
taken
the
liberty
to
make
a
copy
of
those
maxims
by
which
he
guided
a
life
which
was
a
blessing
to
his
country
and
to
the
world
may
i
ask
the
favour
that
you
will
read
them
with
attention
and
if
you
find
anything
contrary
to
right
reason
or
sober
sense
i
shall
be
happy
to
hear
of
it
on
a
future
thank
you
doctor
said
burr
bowing
i
shall
always
be
sensible
of
the
kindness
of
the
motive
which
has
led
you
to
take
this
trouble
on
my
account
believe
me
sir
i
am
truly
obliged
to
you
for
and
thus
the
interview
terminated
that
night
the
doctor
before
retiring
offered
fervent
prayers
for
the
grandson
of
his
revered
master
and
friend
praying
that
his
father
s
and
mother
s
god
might
bless
him
and
make
him
a
living
stone
in
the
eternal
temple
meanwhile
the
object
of
these
prayers
was
sitting
by
a
table
in
and
slippers
thinking
over
the
events
of
the
day
the
paper
which
had
handed
him
contained
the
celebrated
resolutions
by
which
his
ancestor
led
a
life
nobler
than
any
mere
dogmas
can
possibly
be
by
its
side
lay
a
perfumed
note
from
madame
de
frontignac
of
those
womanly
notes
so
beautiful
so
sacred
in
themselves
but
so
mournful
to
a
person
who
sees
whither
they
are
tending
burr
opened
and
perused
it
it
by
the
document
which
the
doctor
had
given
and
thoughtfully
read
the
first
of
the
resolutions
resolved
that
i
will
do
whatsoever
i
think
to
be
most
to
god
s
glory
and
my
own
good
profit
and
pleasure
the
whole
of
my
without
any
consideration
of
time
whether
now
or
never
so
many
myriad
ages
hence
resolved
to
do
whatever
i
think
to
be
my
duty
and
most
for
the
good
and
advantage
of
mankind
in
general
resolved
to
do
this
whatsoever
difficulties
i
meet
with
and
how
many
and
how
great
burr
read
the
whole
paper
through
attentively
once
or
twice
and
paused
thoughtfully
over
many
parts
of
it
he
sat
for
some
time
after
lost
in
reflection
the
paper
dropped
from
his
hand
and
then
followed
one
of
those
long
deep
seasons
of
fixed
reverie
when
the
soul
thinks
by
pictures
and
goes
over
endless
distances
in
moments
in
him
originally
every
moral
faculty
and
sensibility
was
as
keenly
strung
as
in
any
member
of
that
remarkable
family
from
which
he
was
descended
and
which
has
whether
in
good
or
ill
borne
no
common
stamp
two
possible
lives
flashed
before
his
mind
at
that
moment
rapidly
as
when
a
train
sweeps
by
with
flashing
lamps
in
the
night
the
life
of
worldly
expediency
the
life
of
eternal
rectitude
life
of
seventy
years
and
that
life
eternal
in
which
the
event
of
death
is
no
disturbance
suddenly
he
roused
himself
up
picked
up
the
paper
filed
and
dated
it
carefully
and
laid
it
by
and
in
that
moment
was
renewed
again
that
governing
purpose
which
sealed
him
with
all
his
beautiful
capabilities
as
the
slave
of
the
fleeting
and
the
temporary
which
sent
him
at
last
a
shipwrecked
man
to
a
nameless
dishonoured
grave
he
took
his
pen
and
gave
to
a
friend
his
own
views
of
the
events
of
the
day
my
dear
we
are
still
in
newport
conjugating
the
verb
which
i
for
one
have
put
through
all
the
moods
and
tenses
passer
le
however
i
have
belle
and
my
sweet
little
puritan
i
visited
there
this
morning
she
lives
with
her
mother
a
little
walk
out
toward
the
in
a
cottage
quite
prettily
sequestered
among
blossoming
and
the
great
hierarch
of
modern
theology
keeps
guard
over
them
no
chance
here
for
any
indiscretions
you
see
the
good
doctor
astonished
our
here
on
sunday
last
by
treating
us
to
a
solemn
onslaught
on
slavery
and
the
he
had
all
the
chief
captains
and
counsellors
to
hear
him
and
smote
them
hip
and
thigh
and
pursued
them
even
unto
shur
he
is
one
of
those
great
honest
fellows
without
the
smallest
notion
of
the
world
we
live
in
who
think
in
dealing
with
men
that
you
must
go
to
work
and
prove
the
right
and
wrong
of
a
matter
just
as
if
anybody
cared
for
that
supposing
he
is
right
appears
very
probable
to
me
is
he
going
to
do
about
it
no
moral
argument
since
the
world
began
ever
prevailed
over
per
cent
profit
however
he
is
the
spiritual
director
of
belle
and
was
a
resident
in
my
grandfather
s
family
so
i
did
the
agreeable
with
him
as
well
as
such
an
uncircumcised
ishmaelite
could
i
discoursed
theology
with
the
most
docile
air
possible
while
he
explained
to
me
all
the
ins
and
outs
in
his
system
of
the
universe
past
present
and
future
him
dilate
calmly
on
the
millennium
and
expound
prophetic
symbols
marching
out
before
me
his
whole
apocalyptic
menagerie
of
beasts
and
dragons
with
heads
and
horns
innumerable
to
all
which
i
gave
edifying
attention
taking
occasion
now
and
then
to
turn
a
compliment
in
favour
of
the
ladies
lost
you
know
really
he
is
a
worthy
old
soul
and
actually
believes
all
these
things
with
his
whole
heart
attaching
importance
to
the
most
abstract
ideas
and
embarking
his
whole
being
in
his
ideal
view
of
a
grand
millennial
to
the
human
race
i
look
at
him
and
at
myself
and
ask
can
human
beings
be
made
so
unlike
my
little
mary
was
in
a
mood
of
sweet
austere
composure
quite
becoming
to
her
style
of
beauty
her
at
times
is
rather
stimulating
what
a
contrast
between
her
and
belle
française
the
difference
that
there
is
between
a
diamond
and
a
flower
i
find
the
little
thing
has
a
cultivated
mind
enriched
by
reading
and
more
by
a
still
quaint
habit
of
thinking
which
is
new
and
charming
but
a
truce
to
this
i
have
seen
our
friends
at
last
we
have
had
three
or
four
meetings
and
are
waiting
to
hear
from
philadelphia
are
getting
in
train
if
and
dare
to
repeat
what
they
said
again
let
me
know
they
will
find
in
me
a
man
not
to
be
trifled
with
i
shall
be
with
you
in
a
week
or
ten
days
at
farthest
meanwhile
stand
to
your
guns
ever
yours
chapter
xvii
the
next
morning
before
the
early
dews
had
yet
dried
off
the
grass
mary
started
to
go
and
see
her
friend
marvyn
it
was
one
of
those
charming
invigorating
days
familiar
to
those
of
newport
experience
when
the
sea
lies
shimmering
and
glittering
in
deep
blue
and
gold
and
the
sky
above
is
firm
and
cloudless
and
every
breeze
that
comes
landward
seems
to
bear
health
and
energy
upon
its
wings
as
mary
approached
the
house
she
heard
loud
sounds
of
discussion
from
the
open
and
looking
in
saw
a
rather
original
scene
acting
candace
armed
with
a
long
stood
before
the
open
door
of
the
oven
whence
she
had
just
been
removing
an
army
of
good
things
which
appeared
ranged
around
on
the
dresser
cato
in
the
undress
of
a
red
flannel
shirt
and
trousers
was
cuddled
in
a
consoled
and
protected
attitude
in
the
corner
of
the
wooden
settle
with
a
mug
of
flip
in
his
hand
which
candace
had
prepared
and
calling
him
in
from
his
work
authoritatively
ordered
him
to
drink
on
the
showing
that
he
had
kept
her
awake
the
night
before
with
his
cough
and
she
was
sure
he
was
going
to
be
sick
of
course
worse
things
may
happen
to
a
man
than
to
be
vigorously
taken
care
of
by
his
wife
and
cato
had
a
salutary
conviction
of
this
fact
so
that
he
resigned
himself
to
his
comfortable
corner
and
his
flip
with
edifying
serenity
opposite
to
candace
stood
a
corpulent
negro
man
dressed
with
considerable
care
and
with
the
air
of
a
person
on
excellent
terms
with
himself
this
was
no
other
than
digo
the
and
factotum
of
stiles
who
considered
himself
as
the
guardian
of
his
master
s
estate
his
title
his
honour
his
literary
character
his
professional
position
and
his
religious
creed
digo
was
ready
to
assert
before
all
the
world
that
one
and
all
of
these
were
under
his
special
protection
and
that
whoever
had
anything
to
say
to
the
contrary
of
any
of
these
must
expect
to
take
issue
with
him
digo
not
only
swallowed
all
his
master
s
opinions
whole
but
seemed
to
have
the
stomach
of
an
ostrich
in
their
digestion
he
believed
everything
no
matter
what
the
moment
he
understood
that
the
doctor
held
it
he
believed
that
hebrew
was
the
language
of
heaven
the
ten
tribes
of
the
jews
had
reappeared
in
the
north
american
indians
there
was
no
such
thing
as
disinterested
benevolence
and
that
the
doings
of
the
unregenerate
had
some
value
slavery
was
a
divine
ordinance
and
that
was
a
radical
who
did
more
harm
than
good
finally
that
there
never
was
so
great
a
man
as
stiles
and
as
stiles
belonged
to
him
in
the
capacity
of
master
why
he
digo
owned
the
greatest
man
in
america
of
course
as
candace
held
precisely
similar
opinions
in
regard
to
the
two
never
could
meet
without
a
discharge
of
the
opposite
electricities
digo
had
it
is
true
come
ostensibly
on
a
mere
worldly
errand
from
his
mistress
to
marvyn
who
had
promised
to
send
her
some
turkeys
eggs
but
he
had
inly
resolved
with
himself
that
he
would
give
candace
his
opinion
is
what
stiles
had
said
at
dinner
the
day
before
about
s
sunday
s
discourse
stiles
had
not
heard
it
but
digo
had
he
had
felt
it
due
to
the
responsibilities
of
his
position
to
be
present
on
so
very
important
an
occasion
therefore
after
receiving
his
eggs
he
opened
hostilities
by
remarking
in
a
general
way
that
he
had
attended
the
doctor
s
preaching
on
sunday
and
that
there
was
quite
a
crowded
house
candace
immediately
began
mentally
to
bristle
her
feathers
like
a
hen
who
sees
a
hawk
in
the
distance
and
responded
with
decision
den
you
sometin
for
once
in
your
life
i
must
say
said
digo
with
suavity
dat
i
can
t
give
my
proval
to

more
shame
for

said
candace
grimly
a
man
and
not
stan
by
your
colour
and
flunk
under
to

white
ways
ef
you
was
a
man
your
heart
would
a

like
a
at

we

over
after

of

dat

t
oh

dat
dis
yer

de
prophecies
and
bringin
in
de
fulness
of
de
fulness
of

candace

call

de
fulness

ye
and
candace
ended
with
a
guttural
howl
and
stood
frowning
and
gloomy
over
the
top
of
her
long
like
a
black
bellona
leaning
on
her
spear
of
battle
digo
recoiled
a
little
but
stood
too
well
in
his
own
esteem
to
give
up
so
he
shifted
his
attack
well
for
my
part
i
must
say
i
never
was
clined
to
your

why
now

said
she
giving

hack
hackin
all
de
during
this
speech
cato
stood
meekly
bowing
feeling
that
he
was
being
apologized
for
in
the
best
possible
manner
for
long
years
of
instruction
had
fixed
the
idea
in
his
mind
that
he
was
an
ignorant
sinner
who
had
not
the
smallest
notion
how
to
conduct
himself
in
this
world
and
that
if
it
were
not
for
his
wife
s
distinguishing
grace
he
would
long
since
have
been
in
the
shades
of
oblivion
missis
is
spinnin
up
in
de
north
chamber
said
candace
but
i
ll
run
up
and
fetch
her
candace
who
was
about
the
size
of
a
puncheon
was
fond
of
this
familiar
manner
of
representing
her
mode
of
ascending
the
stairs
but
mary
suppressing
a
smile
said
oh
no
candace
don
t
for
the
world
disturb
her
i
know
just
where
she
and
before
candace
could
stop
her
mary
s
light
foot
was
on
the
top
step
of
the
staircase
that
led
up
from
the
kitchen
the
north
room
was
a
large
chamber
overlooking
a
splendid
reach
of
a
moving
panorama
of
blue
water
and
gliding
sails
was
unrolled
before
its
three
windows
so
that
stepping
into
the
room
gave
one
an
instant
and
breezy
sense
of
expansion
marvyn
was
standing
at
the
large
wheel
spinning
wool
reel
and
basket
of
spools
on
her
side
her
large
brown
eyes
had
an
eager
joy
in
them
when
mary
entered
but
they
seemed
to
calm
down
again
and
she
received
her
only
with
that
placid
sincere
air
which
was
her
habit
everything
about
this
woman
showed
an
ardent
soul
repressed
by
timidity
and
by
a
certain
dumbness
in
the
faculties
of
outward
expression
but
her
eyes
had
at
times
that
earnest
appealing
language
which
is
so
pathetic
in
the
silence
of
inferior
animals
one
sometimes
sees
such
eyes
and
wonders
whether
the
story
they
intimate
will
ever
be
spoken
in
mortal
language
mary
began
eagerly
detailing
to
her
all
that
had
interested
her
since
they
last
met
the
party
acquaintance
with
burr
visit
to
the
cottage
inquiries
into
her
education
and
reading
finally
the
proposal
that
they
should
study
french
together
my
dear
said
marvyn
let
us
begin
at
once
an
opportunity
is
not
to
be
lost
i
studied
a
little
with
james
when
he
was
last
at
with
james
said
mary
with
an
air
of
timid
surprise
yes
dear
boy
has
become
what
i
never
expected
quite
a
student
he
employs
all
his
spare
time
now
in
reading
and
studying
second
mate
is
a
frenchman
and
james
has
got
so
that
he
can
both
speak
and
read
he
is
studying
spanish
ever
since
the
last
conversation
with
her
mother
on
the
subject
of
james
mary
had
felt
a
sort
of
guilty
constraint
when
any
one
spoke
of
him
instead
of
answering
frankly
as
she
once
did
when
anything
brought
his
name
up
she
fell
at
once
into
a
grave
embarrassed
silence
marvyn
was
so
constantly
thinking
of
him
that
it
was
difficult
to
begin
on
any
topic
that
did
not
in
some
manner
or
other
knit
itself
into
the
one
ever
present
in
her
thoughts
none
of
the
peculiar
developments
of
the
female
nature
have
a
more
exquisite
vitality
than
the
sentiment
of
a
frail
delicate
repressed
timid
woman
for
a
strong
manly
generous
son
there
is
her
ideal
expressed
there
is
the
and
of
all
she
trembles
to
think
yet
burns
to
say
or
do
here
is
the
hero
that
shall
speak
for
her
the
heart
into
which
she
has
poured
hers
and
that
shall
give
to
her
tremulous
and
hidden
aspirations
a
strong
and
victorious
expression
i
have
gotten
a
from
the
lord
she
says
to
herself
and
each
outburst
of
his
manliness
his
vigour
his
his
superb
vitality
fills
her
with
a
strange
wondering
pleasure
and
she
has
a
secret
tenderness
and
pride
even
in
his
wilfulness
and
waywardness
what
a
creature
he
is
she
says
when
he
flouts
at
sober
argument
and
pitches
all
received
opinions
hither
and
thither
in
the
wild
capriciousness
of
youthful
paradox
she
looks
grave
and
reproving
but
he
reads
the
concealed
triumph
in
her
eyes
knows
that
in
her
heart
she
is
full
of
admiration
all
the
time
first
love
of
womanhood
is
something
wonderful
and
mysterious
in
this
second
love
it
rises
again
idealized
and
refined
she
loves
the
father
and
herself
united
and
made
one
in
this
young
heir
of
life
and
hope
such
was
marvyn
s
still
intense
passionate
love
for
her
son
not
a
tone
of
his
manly
voice
not
a
flash
of
his
dark
eyes
not
one
of
the
deep
shadowy
dimples
that
came
and
went
as
he
laughed
not
a
ring
of
his
glossy
black
hair
that
was
not
studied
got
by
heart
and
dwelt
on
in
the
inner
shrine
of
her
thoughts
he
was
the
romance
of
her
life
his
strong
daring
nature
carried
her
with
it
beyond
those
narrow
daily
bounds
where
her
soul
was
weary
of
treading
and
just
as
his
voyages
had
given
to
the
trite
prose
of
her
a
poetry
of
strange
foreign
perfumes
of
quaint
objects
of
interest
speaking
of
many
a
shore
so
his
mind
and
life
were
a
constant
channel
of
outreach
through
which
her
soul
held
converse
with
the
active
and
stirring
world
marvyn
had
known
all
the
story
of
her
son
s
love
and
to
no
other
woman
would
she
have
been
willing
to
resign
him
but
her
love
to
mary
was
so
deep
that
she
thought
of
his
union
with
her
more
as
gaining
a
daughter
than
as
losing
a
son
she
would
not
speak
of
the
subject
she
knew
the
feelings
of
mary
s
mother
and
the
name
of
james
fell
so
often
from
her
lips
simply
because
it
was
so
in
her
heart
that
it
could
not
be
helped
before
mary
left
it
was
arranged
that
they
should
study
together
and
that
the
lessons
should
be
given
alternately
at
each
other
s
houses
and
with
this
understanding
they
parted

sweet
airs
tripped
stirringly
to
and
fro
about
the
making
gentle
confusions
fluttering
papers
on
moral
ability
agitating
treatises
on
the
great
end
of
creation
mixing
up
subtile
distinctions
between
amiable
instincts
and
true
holiness

in
short
conducting

like
very
unappreciative
and
unphilosophical
little

illustration
doubt
about
the
sampson
low
son
augt
the
doctor
patiently
smoothed
back
and
rearranged
while
opposite
to
him
sat
mary
bending
over
some
copying
she
was
doing
for
him
one
stray
sunbeam
fell
on
her
hair
tinging
it
to
gold
her
long
drooping
lashes
lay
over
the
pink
of
her
cheeks
as
she
wrote
on
mary
said
the
doctor
pushing
the
papers
from
him
sir
she
answered
looking
up
the
blood
just
perceptibly
rising
in
her
cheeks
do
you
ever
have
any
periods
in
which
your
evidences
seem
not
altogether
clear
nothing
could
show
more
forcibly
the
grave
earnest
character
of
thought
in
new
england
at
this
time
than
the
fact
that
this
use
of
the
term
evidences
had
become
universally
significant
and
understood
as
relating
to
one
s
right
of
citizenship
in
a
celestial
invisible
commonwealth
so
mary
understood
it
and
it
was
with
a
deepened
flush
she
answered
gently
no
what
never
any
doubts
said
the
doctor
i
am
sorry
said
mary
apologetically
but
i
do
not
see
how
i
have
i
never
ah
said
the
doctor
musingly
would
i
could
say
so
there
are
times
indeed
when
i
hope
i
have
an
interest
in
the
precious
redeemer
and
behold
an
infinite
loveliness
and
beauty
in
him
apart
from
anything
i
expect
or
hope
but
even
then
how
deceitful
is
the
human
heart
how
insensibly
might
a
mere
selfish
love
take
the
place
of
that
disinterested
complacency
which
regards
him
for
what
he
is
in
himself
apart
from
what
he
is
to
us
say
my
dear
friend
does
not
this
thought
sometimes
make
you
tremble
poor
mary
was
truth
itself
and
this
question
distressed
her
she
must
answer
the
truth
the
fact
was
that
it
had
never
come
into
her
blessed
little
heart
to
tremble
for
she
was
one
of
those
children
of
the
who
can
not
mourn
because
the
bridegroom
is
ever
with
them
but
then
when
she
saw
the
man
for
whom
her
reverence
was
almost
like
that
for
her
god
thus
distrustful
thus
lowly
she
could
not
but
feel
that
her
too
calm
repose
might
after
all
be
the
shallow
treacherous
calm
of
an
ignorant
spirit
and
therefore
with
a
deep
blush
and
a
faltering
voice
she
said
indeed
i
am
afraid
something
must
be
wrong
with
me
i
have
any
fears
never
could
i
try
sometimes
but
the
thought
of
god
s
goodness
comes
all
around
me
and
i
am
so
happy
before
i
think
of
it
such
exercises
my
dear
friend
i
have
also
had
said
the
doctor
but
before
i
rest
on
them
as
evidences
i
feel
constrained
to
make
the
following
inquiries
this
gratitude
that
swells
my
bosom
the
result
of
a
mere
natural
sensibility
does
it
arise
in
a
particular
manner
because
god
has
done
me
good
or
do
i
love
god
for
what
he
as
well
as
for
what
he
has
done
and
for
what
he
has
done
for
others
as
well
as
for
what
he
has
done
for
me
love
to
god
which
is
built
on
nothing
but
good
received
is
not
incompatible
with
a
disposition
so
horrid
as
even
to
curse
god
to
his
face
if
god
is
not
to
be
loved
except
when
he
does
good
then
in
affliction
we
are
free
if
doing
good
is
all
that
renders
god
lovely
to
us
then
not
doing
us
good
divests
him
of
his
glory
and
dispenses
us
from
obligation
to
love
him
but
there
must
be
undoubtedly
some
permanent
reason
why
god
is
to
be
loved
by
all
and
if
not
doing
us
good
divests
him
of
his
glory
so
as
to
free
from
our
obligation
to
love
it
equally
frees
the
universe
so
that
in
fact
the
universe
of
happiness
if
ours
be
not
included
reflects
no
glory
on
its
the
doctor
had
practised
his
subtile
mental
analysis
till
his
instruments
were
so
and
that
he
scarce
ever
allowed
a
flower
of
sacred
emotion
to
spring
in
his
soul
without
picking
it
to
pieces
to
see
if
its
genera
and
species
were
correct
love
gratitude
reverence
benevolence
all
moved
in
mighty
tides
in
his
all
compelled
to
pause
midway
while
he
rubbed
up
his
optical
instruments
to
see
whether
they
were
rising
in
right
order
mary
on
the
contrary
had
the
blessed
gift
of
womanhood
vivid
life
in
the
soul
and
sentiment
which
resists
the
chills
of
analysis
as
a
healthful
human
heart
resists
cold
yet
still
all
humbly
she
thought
this
perhaps
was
a
defect
in
herself
and
therefore
having
confessed
in
a
depreciating
tone
her
habits
of
unanalysed
faith
and
love
she
added
but
my
dear
sir
you
are
my
best
friend
i
trust
you
will
be
faithful
to
me
if
i
am
deceiving
myself
undeceive
me
you
can
not
be
too
severe
with
alas
said
the
doctor
i
fear
that
i
may
be
only
a
blind
leader
of
the
blind
what
after
all
if
i
be
only
a
miserable
what
if
some
thought
of
self
has
come
in
to
poison
all
my
prayers
and
strivings
it
is
true
i
think
i
said
the
doctor
speaking
very
slowly
and
with
intense
earnestness
i
think
that
if
i
knew
at
this
moment
that
my
name
never
would
be
written
among
those
of
the
elect
i
could
still
see
god
to
be
infinitely
amiable
and
glorious
and
could
feel
sure
that
he
not
do
me
wrong
and
that
it
was
infinitely
becoming
and
right
that
he
should
dispose
of
me
according
to
his
sovereign
pleasure
i
so
still
my
deceitful
heart
all
i
might
find
it
rising
in
rebellion
say
my
dear
friend
are
you
sure
that
should
you
discover
yourself
to
be
for
ever
condemned
by
his
justice
you
would
not
find
your
heart
rising
up
against
him
against
said
mary
with
a
tremulous
sorrowful
expression
on
her
face
against
my
heavenly
father
her
face
flushed
and
faded
her
eyes
kindled
eagerly
as
if
she
had
something
to
say
and
then
grew
misty
with
tears
at
last
she
said
thank
you
my
dear
faithful
friend
i
will
think
about
this
i
may
have
been
deceived
how
very
difficult
it
must
be
to
know
one
s
self
perfectly
mary
went
into
her
own
little
room
and
sat
leaning
for
a
long
time
with
her
elbow
on
the
watching
the
pale
shells
of
the
as
they
sailed
and
fluttered
downward
into
the
grass
and
listened
to
a
chippering
conversation
in
which
the
birds
in
the
nest
above
were
settling
up
their
small
housekeeping
accounts
for
the
day
after
a
while
she
took
her
pen
and
wrote
the
following
which
the
doctor
found
the
next
morning
lying
on
his
my
dear
honoured
friend
can
i
sufficiently
thank
you
for
your
faithfulness
with
me
all
you
say
to
me
seems
true
and
excellent
and
yet
my
dear
sir
permit
me
to
try
to
express
to
you
some
of
the
many
thoughts
to
which
our
conversation
this
evening
has
given
rise
to
love
god
because
he
is
good
to
me
you
seem
to
think
is
not
a
right
kind
of
love
and
yet
every
moment
of
my
life
i
have
experienced
his
goodness
when
recollection
brings
back
the
past
where
can
i
look
that
i
see
not
his
goodness
what
moment
of
my
life
presents
not
instances
of
merciful
kindness
to
me
as
well
as
to
every
creature
more
and
greater
than
i
can
express
than
my
mind
is
able
to
take
in
how
then
can
i
help
loving
god
because
he
is
good
to
me
were
i
not
an
object
of
god
s
mercy
and
goodness
i
can
not
have
any
conception
what
would
be
my
feeling
imagination
never
yet
placed
me
in
a
situation
not
to
experience
the
goodness
of
god
in
some
way
or
other
and
if
i
do
love
him
how
can
it
be
but
because
he
is
good
and
to
me
good
do
not
god
s
children
love
him
because
he
first
loved
them
if
i
called
nothing
goodness
which
did
not
happen
to
suit
my
inclination
and
could
not
believe
the
deity
to
be
gracious
and
merciful
except
when
the
course
of
events
was
so
ordered
as
to
agree
with
my
humour
so
far
from
imagining
that
i
had
any
love
to
god
i
must
conclude
myself
wholly
destitute
of
anything
good
a
love
founded
on
nothing
but
good
received
is
not
you
say
incompatible
with
a
disposition
so
horrid
as
even
to
curse
god
i
am
not
sensible
that
i
ever
in
my
life
imagined
anything
good
could
come
from
the
hand
of
god
from
a
being
infinite
in
goodness
everything
be
good
though
we
do
not
always
comprehend
how
it
is
so
are
not
afflictions
good
does
he
not
even
in
judgment
remember
mercy
sensible
that
afflictions
are
but
blessings
in
disguise
i
would
bless
the
hand
that
with
infinite
kindness
wounds
only
to
heal
and
love
and
adore
the
goodness
of
god
equally
in
suffering
as
in
rejoicing
the
disinterested
love
to
god
which
you
think
is
alone
the
genuine
love
i
see
not
how
we
can
be
certain
we
possess
when
our
love
of
happiness
and
our
love
of
god
are
so
inseparably
connected
the
joys
arising
from
a
consciousness
that
god
is
a
benefactor
to
me
and
my
friends
and
when
i
think
of
god
every
creature
is
my
friend
if
arising
from
a
selfish
motive
it
does
not
seem
to
me
possible
could
be
changed
into
hate
even
supposing
god
my
enemy
whilst
i
regarded
him
as
a
being
infinitely
just
as
well
as
good
if
god
is
my
enemy
it
must
be
because
i
deserve
he
should
be
such
and
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
i
should
hate
him
even
if
i
knew
he
would
always
be
so
in
what
you
say
of
willingness
to
suffer
eternal
punishment
i
don
t
know
that
i
understand
what
the
feeling
is
is
it
wickedness
in
me
that
i
do
not
feel
a
willingness
to
be
left
to
eternal
sin
can
any
one
joyfully
acquiesce
in
being
thus
left
when
i
pray
for
a
new
heart
and
a
right
spirit
must
i
be
willing
to
be
denied
and
rejoice
that
my
prayer
is
not
heard
could
any
real
christian
rejoice
in
this
but
he
fears
it
not
knows
it
will
never
be
therefore
can
cheerfully
leave
it
with
god
and
so
can
i
such
my
dear
friend
are
my
thoughts
poor
and
unworthy
yet
they
seem
to
me
as
certain
as
my
life
or
as
anything
i
see
am
i
unduly
confident
i
ask
your
prayers
that
i
may
be
guided
aright
your
affectionate
friend
there
are
in

noiseless
flight

a
man
has
toiled
till
his
feet
weigh
too
heavily
with
the
mud

enable
him
to

these
little
birds

often
cleave
the
air
in
a

line
towards
the
bosom
of

show
the
way
where
he

never
have

the
doctor
paused
in
his
ponderous
and
heavy
reasonings
to
read
this
real
woman
s
letter
and
being
a
loving
man
he
felt
as
if
he
could
have
kissed
the
hem

garment

wrote

recorded
it

course

a
day

two

up
in

alighted

divined
with
the
tact
which
belongs
to
women
in
the
positive
and
to
french
women
in
the
superlative
degree
that
there
was
something
in
the
whom
she
had
passingly
seen
at
the
party
which
powerfully
affected
the
man
whom
she
loved
with
all
the
jealous
intensity
of
a
strong
nature
and
hence
she
embraced
eagerly
the
opportunity
to
see
her
to
see
her
to
study
her
to
dart
her
keen
french
wit
through
her
and
detect
the
secret
of
her
charm
that
she
too
might
practise
it
madame
de
frontignac
was
one
of
those
women
whose
beauty
is
so
striking
and
imposing
that
they
seem
to
kindle
up
even
in
the
most
prosaic
apartment
an
atmosphere
of
enchantment
all
the
pomp
and
splendour
of
high
life
the
wit
the
refinements
the
nameless
graces
and
luxuries
of
courts
seemed
to
breathe
in
invisible
airs
around
her
and
she
made
a
faubourg
germain
of
the
darkest
room
into
which
she
entered

when
she
came
in
that
she
had
never

drooped
with
its
long
plumes

as
to
cast
a
shadow
over
her
animated
face
out
of
which
her
dark
eyes
shone
like
jewels
and
her
pomegranate
cheeks
glowed
with
the
rich
shaded
radiance
of
one
of
rembrandt

pictures
something
quaint
and
foreign
something
poetic
and
strange
marked
each
turn
of
her
figure

article
of
her
dress
down
to
the
sculptured
hand
on
which
glittered
singular
and
costly
rings

who
felt
more
than
any
other
artist
the
glory
of
the
physical
life

embodied
his
conception
of
the
madonna

opposition
to
the
faded
cold
ideals

her
hand
the

a
gorgeous
paroquet
the
two
styles
in
this
instance
were
both
in
the
same
room
and
as
burr
sat
looking
from
one
to
the
other
he
felt
for
a
moment
as
one
would
who
should
put
a
sketch
of
overbeck

beside
a
splendid
painting
of
titian

for
a
few
moments
everything
in
the
room
seemed
faded
and
cold
in
contrast
with
the
tropical
atmosphere
of
this
regal
beauty
burr
watched
mary
with
a
keen
eye
to
see
if
she
were
dazzled
and
overawed
he
saw
nothing
but
the
most
innocent
surprise
and
delight
all
the
slumbering
poetry
within
her
seemed
to
awaken
at
the
presence
of
her
beautiful
neighbour

for
the
first
time

before
the
great
revelations
of

mary

cheek
glowed
her
eyes
seemed
to
grow
deep
with
the
enthusiasm
of
admiration
and
after
a
few
moments
it
seemed
as
if
her
delicate
face
and
figure
reflected
the
glowing
loveliness
of
her
visitor
just
as
the
virgin
snows
of
the
alps
become
incarnadine

madame

accustomed
to
the
effect
of
her
charms
but
there
was
so
much
love
in
the
admiration
now
directed
towards
her
that
her
own
warm
nature
was
touched
and
she
threw
out
the
glow
of
her
feelings
with
a
magnetic
power
mary
never
felt
the
cold
habitual
reserve
of
her
education
so
suddenly
melt
never
felt
herself
so
naturally
falling
into
language
of
confidence
and
endearment
with
a
stranger
and
as
her
face
so
delicate
and
spiritual
grew
bright
with
love
madame
de
frontignac
thought
she
had
never
seen
anything
so
beautiful
and
stretching
out
her
hands
towards
her
she
exclaimed
in
her
own
language
mon
dieu
mon
enfant
que
tu
es
belle
mary
s
deep
blush
at
her
ignorance
of
the
language
in
which
her
visitor
spoke
recalled
her
to
herself
laughed
a
clear
silvery
laugh
and
laid
her
jewelled
little
hand
on
mary
s
with
a
caressing
movement
shall
not
teach
you
french
toute
she
said
indicating
the
abbé
by
a
pretty
wilful
gesture
will
teach
you
you
shall
teach
me
english
oh
i
shall
try
hard
to
learn
she
said
there
was
something
inexpressibly
pretty
and
quaint
in
the
childish
lisp
with
which
she
pronounced
english
mary
was
completely
won
over
she
could
have
fallen
into
the
arms
of
this
wondrously
beautiful
fairy
princess
expecting
to
be
carried
away
by
her
to
dreamland
meanwhile
scudder
was
gravely
discoursing
with
colonel
burr
and
de
frontignac
and
the
abbé
a
small
and
gentlemanly
personage
with
clear
black
eye
features
and
powdered
hair
appeared
to
be
absorbed
in
his
efforts
to
follow
the
current
of
a
conversation
imperfectly
understood
burr
the
while
though
seeming
to
be
entirely
and
politely
absorbed
in
the
conversation
he
was
conducting
lost
not
a
glimpse
of
the
picturesque
aside
which
was
being
enacted
between
the
two
fair
ones
whom
he
had
thus
brought
together
he
smiled
quietly
when
he
saw
the
effect
madame
de
frontignac
produced
on
mary
after
all
the
child
has
flesh
and
blood
he
thought
and
may
feel
that
there
are
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth
than
she
has
dreamed
of
yet
a
few
french
ideas
won
t
hurt
the
arrangements
about
lessons
being
completed
the
party
returned
to
the
carriage
madame
de
frontignac
was
enthusiastic
in
mary
s
praise
she
said
leaning
back
thoughtfully
after
having
exhausted
herself
in
superlatives
elle
est
dévote
à
comment
cela
se
it
is
the
effect
of
her
austere
education
said
burr
it
is
not
possible
for
you
to
conceive
how
young
people
are
trained
in
the
religious
families
of
this
but
yet
said
madame
it
gives
her
a
grace
altogether
peculiar
something
in
her
looks
went
to
my
heart
i
could
find
it
very
easy
to
love
her
because
she
is
really
the
queen
of
hearts
should
know
all
that
is
possible
in
loving
said
burr
somehow
of
late
the
compliments
which
fell
so
readily
from
those
graceful
lips
had
brought
with
them
an
unsatisfying
pain
until
a
woman
really
flattery
and
compliment
are
often
like
her
native
air
but
when
that
deeper
feeling
has
once
awakened
in
her
her
instincts
become
marvellously
acute
to
detect
the
false
from
the
true
madame
de
frontignac
longed
for
one
strong
unguarded
real
earnest
word
from
the
man
who
had
stolen
from
her
her
whole
being
she
was
beginning
to
feel
in
some
dim
wise
what
an
untold
treasure
she
was
daily
giving
for
tinsel
and
dross
she
leaned
back
in
the
carriage
with
a
restless
burning
cheek
and
wondered
why
she
was
born
to
be
so
miserable
the
thought
of
mary
s
saintly
face
and
tender
eyes
rose
before
her
as
the
moon
rises
on
the
eyes
of
some
hot
and
fevered
invalid
inspiring
vague
yearnings
after
an
unknown
unattainable
peace
could
some
friendly
power
once
have
made
her
at
that
time
clairvoyant
and
shown
her
the
of
the
man
whom
she
was
seeing
through
the
prismatic
glass
of
her
own
enkindled
ideality
could
she
have
seen
the
calculating
quietness
in
which
during
the
intervals
of
a
restless
and
sleepless
ambition
he
played
upon
her
as
one
uses
a
musical
instrument
to
beguile
a
passing
hour
his
only
embarrassment
was
the
fear
that
the
feelings
he
was
pleased
to
excite
might
become
too
warm
and
too
strong
while
as
yet
his
relations
to
her
husband
were
such
as
to
make
it
dangerous
to
arouse
his
jealousy
and
if
he
could
have
seen
that
pure
ideal
conception
of
himself
which
alone
gave
him
power
in
the
heart
of
this
woman
spotless
glorified
image
of
a
hero
without
fear
without
reproach
he
have
felt
a
moment
s
shame
and
abasement
at
its
utter
falsehood
the
poet
says
that
the
evil
spirit
stood
abashed
when
he
saw
virtue
in
an
angel
form
how
would
a
man
then
stand
who
meets
face
to
face
his
own
glorified
spotless
ideal
made
living
by
the
boundless
faith
of
some
believing
heart
the
best
must
needs
lay
his
hand
on
his
mouth
at
this
apparition
but
woe
to
him
who
feels
no
redeeming
power
in
the
sacredness
of
this
believing
dream
with
calculating
shrewdness
this
most
touching
miracle
of
love
only
to
corrupt
and
destroy
the
loving
for
him
there
is
no
sacrifice
for
sin
no
place
for
repentance
his
very
mother
might
shrink
in
her
grave
to
have
him
laid
beside
her
madame
de
frontignac
had
the
high
honourable
nature
of
the
old
blood
of
france
and
a
touch
of
its
romance
she
was
strung
heroically
and
educated
according
to
the
notions
of
her
caste
and
church
purely
and
religiously
true
it
is
that
one
can
scarcely
call
education
which
teaches
woman
everything
except
herself
the
things
that
relate
to
her
own
peculiar
womanly
destiny
and
on
plea
of
the
holiness
of
ignorance
sends
her
without
one
word
of
just
counsel
into
the
temptations
of
life
incredible
as
it
may
seem
virginie
de
frontignac
had
never
read
a
romance
or
work
of
fiction
of
which
love
was
the
staple
the
of
the
convent
in
this
regard
was
inexorable
at
eighteen
she
was
more
thoroughly
a
child
than
most
american
girls
at
thirteen
on
entrance
into
life
she
was
at
first
so
dazzled
and
bewildered
by
the
mere
contrast
of
fashionable
excitement
with
the
quietness
of
the
scenes
in
which
she
had
hitherto
grown
up
that
she
had
no
time
for
reading
or
thought
was
one
intoxicating
frolic
of
existence
one
dazzling
bewildering
dream
he
whose
eye
had
measured
her
for
his
victim
verified
if
ever
man
did
the
proverbial
expression
of
the
iron
hand
under
the
velvet
glove
under
all
his
gentle
suavities
there
was
a
fixed
inflexible
will
a
calm
and
a
composed
philosophical
measurement
of
others
that
fitted
him
to
bear
despotic
rule
over
an
impulsive
unguarded
nature
the
position
at
once
accorded
to
him
of
her
instructor
in
the
english
language
and
literature
gave
him
a
thousand
daily
opportunities
to
touch
and
stimulate
all
that
class
of
finer
faculties
so
restless
and
so
perilous
and
which
a
good
man
approaches
always
with
a
certain
awe
it
is
said
that
he
once
asserted
that
he
never
beguiled
a
woman
who
did
not
come
to
meet
him
observation
much
the
same
as
a
serpent
might
make
in
regard
to
his
birds
the
visit
of
the
morning
was
followed
by
several
others
madame
de
frontignac
seemed
to
conceive
for
mary
one
of
those
passionate
attachments
which
women
often
conceive
for
anything
fair
and
sympathizing
at
those
periods
when
their
whole
inner
being
is
made
vital
by
the
approaches
of
a
grand
passion
it
took
only
a
few
visits
to
make
her
as
familiar
as
a
child
at
the
cottage
and
the
whole
air
of
the
faubourg
germain
seemed
to
melt
away
from
her
as
with
the
pliability
peculiar
to
her
nation
she
blended
herself
with
the
quiet
pursuits
of
the
family
sometimes
in
simple
straw
hat
and
white
wrapper
she
would
lie
down
in
the
grass
under
the
or
join
mary
in
an
expedition
to
the
barn
for
hen
s
eggs
or
a
run
along
the
for
shells
and
her
childish
eagerness
and
delight
on
these
occasions
used
to
arouse
the
unqualified
astonishment
of
katy
scudder
the
doctor
she
regarded
with
a
astonishment
slightly
tinctured
with
apprehension
she
knew
he
was
very
religious
and
stretched
her
comprehension
to
imagine
what
he
might
be
like
she
thought
of
bossuet
s
sermons
walking
about
under
a
protestant
coat
and
felt
vaguely
alarmed
and
sinful
in
his
presence
as
she
used
to
when
entering
under
the
shadows
of
a
cathedral
in
her
the
religious
sentiment
though
vague
was
strong
nothing
in
the
character
of
burr
had
ever
awakened
so
much
disapprobation
as
his
occasional
sneers
at
religion
on
such
occasions
she
always
reproved
him
with
warmth
but
excused
him
in
her
heart
because
he
was
brought
up
a
heretic
she
held
a
special
theological
conversation
with
the
abbé
whether
salvation
were
possible
to
one
outside
of
the
true
church
had
added
to
her
daily
prayer
a
particular
invocation
to
the
virgin
for
him
the
french
lessons
with
her
assistance
proceeded
prosperously
she
became
an
inmate
in
marvyn
s
family
also
the
sensitive
woman
loved
her
as
a
new
poem
she
felt
enchanted
by
her
and
the
prosaic
details
of
her
household
seemed
touched
to
poetic
life
by
her
innocent
interest
and
admiration
the
young
madame
insisted
on
being
taught
to
spin
at
the
great
wheel
and
a
very
pretty
picture
she
made
of
it
too
with
her
earnest
gravity
of
endeavour
her
deepening
cheek
her
graceful
form
with
some
strange
foreign
scarf
or
jewelry
waving
and
flashing
in
odd
contrast
with
her
work
do
you
know
she
said
one
day
while
thus
employed
in
the
north
room
at
marvyn
s
do
you
know
burr
told
me
that
princesses
used
to
spin
he
read
me
a
beautiful
story
from
the
odyssey
about
how
penelope
cheated
her
lovers
with
her
spinning
while
she
was
waiting
for
her
husband
to
come
home
was
gone
to
sea
mary
love
she
turned
on
mary
a
wicked
glance
so
full
of
intelligence
that
the
snowdrop
grew
red
as
the
inside
of
a
enfant
thou
hast
a
thought
in
she
said
to
mary
one
day
as
they
sat
together
in
the
grass
under
the
why
what
said
mary
with
a
startled
and
guilty
look
why
what
said
the
fairy
princess
whimsically
mimicking
her
accent
ah
ma
belle
you
think
i
have
no
eyes
sees
deep
in
here
she
said
laying
her
hand
playfully
on
mary
s
heart
petite
she
said
gravely
and
almost
sorrowfully
if
you
love
him
wait
for
him
t
marry
another
it
is
dreadful
not
to
have
one
s
heart
go
with
one
s
i
shall
never
marry
anybody
said
mary
nevare
marrie
anybodie
said
the
lady
imitating
her
accents
in
tones
much
like
those
of
a
bobolink
ah
ah
my
little
saint
you
can
not
always
live
on
nothing
but
the
prayers
though
prayers
are
verie
good
but
she
added
in
a
low
tone
don
t
you
ever
marry
that
good
man
in
there
priests
should
not
ours
are
not
priests
are
ministers
said
mary
but
why
do
you
speak
of
him
is
like
my
virginie
sees
something
said
the
lady
shaking
her
head
gravely
she
sees
he
loves
little
of
course
he
does
yes
and
comes
the
mamma
and
she
takes
this
little
hand
and
she
says
come
mary
and
then
she
gives
it
to
him
and
then
the
poor
when
he
comes
back
finds
not
a
bird
in
his
poor
little
nest
c
est
ennuyeux
cela
she
said
throwing
herself
back
in
the
grass
till
the
clover
heads
and
buttercups
closed
over
her
i
do
assure
you
dear
madame
i
do
assure
you
dear
mary
so
lock
up
her
words
in
your
little
heart
you
will
want
them
some
there
was
a
pause
of
some
moments
while
the
lady
was
watching
the
course
of
a
cricket
through
the
clover
at
last
lifting
her
head
she
spoke
very
gravely
my
little
cat
it
is
to
be
married
to
a
good
man
and
want
to
be
good
and
want
to
love
him
and
yet
never
like
to
have
him
take
your
hand
and
be
more
glad
when
he
is
away
than
when
he
is
at
home
and
then
to
think
how
different
it
would
all
be
if
it
was
only
somebody
else
that
will
be
the
way
with
you
if
you
let
them
lead
you
into
this
so
don
t
you
do
it
a
thought
seemed
to
cross
mary
s
mind
as
she
turned
to
madame
de
frontignac
and
said
earnestly
if
a
good
man
were
my
husband
i
would
never
think
of
another
wouldn
t
let
how
could
you
help
it
can
you
stop
your
thinking
mary
said
after
a
moment
s
blush
i
can
ah
yes
but
to
try
all
one
s
life
mary
that
is
too
hard
never
do
it
darling
and
then
madame
de
frontignac
broke
out
into
a
carolling
little
french
song
which
started
all
the
birds
around
into
a
general
orchestral
accompaniment
this
conversation
occurred
just
before
madame
de
frontignac
started
for
philadelphia
whither
her
husband
had
been
summoned
as
an
agent
in
some
of
the
ambitious
intrigues
of
burr
it
was
with
a
sigh
of
regret
that
she
parted
from
her
friends
at
the
cottage
she
made
them
a
hasty
call
from
a
splendid
barouche
with
two
white
horses
and
filling
their
simple
best
room
with
the
light
of
her
presence
for
a
last
when
she
bade
to
mary
she
folded
her
warmly
to
her
heart
and
her
long
lashes
drooped
heavily
with
tears
after
her
absence
the
lessons
were
still
pursued
with
the
gentle
quiet
little
abbé
who
seemed
the
most
patient
and
assiduous
of
teachers
but
in
both
houses
there
was
that
vague
that
sense
of
want
which
follows
the
fading
of
one
of
life
s
beautiful
dreams
we
bid
her
adieu
for
a
season
may
see
her
again
chapter
xx
the
summer
passed
over
the
cottage
noiselessly
as
our
summers
pass
there
were
white
clouds
walking
in
saintly
troops
over
blue
mirrors
of
sea
were
purple
mornings
choral
with
were
golden
evenings
with
long
eastward
shadows
died
quietly
in
the
deep
and
tiny
apples
waxed
and
rounded
and
ripened
and
gained
stripes
of
gold
and
carmine
and
the
blue
eggs
broke
into
young
robins
that
grew
from
gaping
youth
to
fledged
and
outflying
maturity
came
autumn
with
its
long
indian
summer
and
winter
with
its
flinty
sparkling
snows
under
which
all
nature
lay
a
sealed
and
beautiful
corpse
came
once
more
the
spring
winds
the
lengthening
days
the
opening
flowers
and
the
miracle
of
buds
and
blossoms
on
the
around
the
cottage
a
year
had
passed
since
the
june
afternoon
when
first
we
showed
you
mary
standing
under
the
spotty
shadows
of
the
tree
with
the
white
dove
on
her
hand
year
in
which
not
many
outward
changes
have
been
made
in
the
relations
of
the
actors
of
our
story
mary
calmly
spun
and
read
and
thought
now
and
then
composing
with
care
very
letters
to
be
sent
to
philadelphia
to
madame
de
frontignac
and
receiving
short
missives
of
very
in
return
the
cautions
of
madame
in
regard
to
the
doctor
had
not
rippled
the
current
of
their
calm
confiding
intercourse
and
the
doctor
so
very
satisfied
and
happy
in
her
constant
society
and
affection
scarcely
as
yet
meditated
distinctly
that
he
needed
to
draw
her
more
closely
to
himself
if
he
had
a
passage
to
read
a
page
to
be
copied
a
thought
to
express
was
she
not
ever
there
gentle
patient
unselfish
and
scarce
by
the
absence
of
a
day
did
she
let
him
perceive
that
his
need
of
her
was
becoming
so
absolute
that
his
hold
on
her
must
needs
be
made
permanent
as
to
his
salary
and
temporal
concerns
they
had
suffered
somewhat
for
his
unpopular
warfare
with
reigning
sins
fact
which
had
rather
reconciled
scudder
to
the
dilatory
movement
of
her
cherished
hopes
since
james
was
gone
what
need
to
press
imprudently
to
new
arrangements
better
give
the
little
heart
time
to
grow
over
before
starting
a
subject
which
a
certain
womanly
instinct
told
her
might
be
met
with
a
struggle
somehow
she
never
thought
without
a
certain
of
mary
s
look
and
tone
the
night
she
spoke
with
her
about
james
she
had
an
awful
presentiment
that
that
tone
of
voice
belonged
to
the
things
that
can
not
be
shaken
but
yet
mary
seemed
so
even
so
quiet
her
delicate
form
filled
out
and
rounded
so
beautifully
and
she
sang
so
cheerfully
at
her
work
and
above
all
she
was
so
entirely
silent
about
james
that
scudder
had
hope
ah
that
silence
do
not
listen
to
hear
whom
a
woman
praises
to
know
where
her
heart
is
do
not
ask
for
whom
she
expresses
the
most
earnest
enthusiasm
but
if
there
be
one
she
once
knew
well
whose
name
she
never
speaks
she
seem
to
have
an
instinct
to
avoid
every
occasion
of
its
mention
when
you
speak
she
drops
into
silence
and
changes
the
subject
look
there
for
something
just
as
when
going
through
deep
a
bird
flies
ostentatiously
up
before
you
you
may
know
her
nest
is
not
there
but
far
off
under
distant
tufts
of
fern
and
buttercup
through
which
she
has
crept
with
a
silent
flutter
in
her
spotted
breast
to
act
her
pretty
little
falsehood
before
you
poor
mary
s
little
nest
was
along
the
sedgy
margin
of
the
where
grow
the
tufts
of
where
wave
the
reeds
where
crimson
green
and
purple
float
up
like
torn
fringes
of
nereid
vestures
and
gold
and
silver
shells
lie
on
the
wet
wrinkles
of
the
sands
the
sea
had
become
to
her
like
a
friend
with
its
monotony
somehow
she
loved
this
old
fresh
blue
babbling
restless
giant
who
had
carried
away
her
heart
s
love
to
hide
him
in
some
far
off
palmy
island
such
as
she
had
often
heard
him
tell
of
in
his
sea
romances
sometimes
she
would
wander
out
for
an
afternoon
s
stroll
on
the
rocks
and
pause
by
the
great
spouting
cave
now
famous
to
newport
but
then
a
sacred
and
impressive
solitude
there
the
rising
tide
bursts
with
deafening
strokes
through
a
narrow
opening
into
some
inner
cavern
which
with
a
deep
like
the
voice
of
an
angry
lion
casts
it
back
in
a
high
jet
of
foam
into
the
sea
mary
often
sat
and
listened
to
this
hollow
noise
and
watched
the
columns
of
spray
as
they
reddened
with
the
transpiercing
beams
of
the
afternoon
sun
and
thence
her
eye
travelled
far
far
off
over
the
shimmering
starry
blue
where
sails
looked
no
bigger
than
miller
s
wings
and
it
seemed
sometimes
as
if
a
door
were
opening
by
which
her
soul
might
go
out
into
some
eternity
abyss
so
wide
and
deep
that
fathomless
lines
of
thought
could
not
sound
it
she
was
no
longer
a
girl
in
a
mortal
body
but
an
infinite
spirit
the
adoring
companion
of
infinite
beauty
and
infinite
love
as
there
was
an
hour
when
the
fishermen
of
galilee
saw
their
master
transfigured
his
raiment
white
and
glistening
and
his
face
like
the
light
so
are
there
hours
when
our
whole
mortal
life
stands
forth
in
a
celestial
radiance
from
our
daily
lot
falls
off
every
weed
of
care
our
every
speck
and
stain
of
earthly
infirmity
our
horizon
widens
and
blue
and
amethyst
and
gold
touch
every
object
absent
friends
and
friends
gone
on
the
last
long
journey
stand
once
more
together
bright
with
an
immortal
glow
and
like
the
disciples
who
saw
their
master
floating
in
the
clouds
above
them
we
say
lord
it
is
good
to
be
here
how
fair
the
wife
the
husband
the
absent
mother
the
father
the
manly
son
the
daughter
seen
in
the
actual
present
all
have
some
fault
some
flaw
but
absent
we
see
them
in
their
permanent
and
better
selves
of
our
distant
home
we
remember
not
one
dark
day
not
one
servile
care
nothing
but
the
echo
of
its
holy
hymns
and
the
radiance
of
its
brightest
days
our
father
not
one
hasty
word
but
only
the
fulness
of
his
manly
vigour
and
noble
tenderness
our
mother
nothing
of
mortal
weakness
but
a
glorified
form
of
love
our
brother
not
one
teasing
provoking
word
of
brotherly
freedom
but
the
proud
beauty
of
his
noblest
hours
our
sister
our
child
only
what
is
fairest
and
sweetest
this
is
to
life
the
true
ideal
the
calm
glass
wherein
looking
we
shall
see
that
whatever
defects
cling
to
us
they
are
not
after
all
permanent
and
that
we
are
tending
to
something
nobler
than
we
yet
are
is
the
earnest
of
our
inheritance
until
the
redemption
of
the
purchased
in
the
resurrection
we
shall
see
our
friends
for
ever
as
we
see
them
in
these
clairvoyant
hours
we
are
writing
thus
on
and
on
linking
image
and
thought
and
feeling
and
lingering
over
every
flower
and
listening
to
every
bird
because
just
before
us
there
lies
a
dark
valley
and
we
shrink
and
tremble
to
enter
it
but
it
come
and
why
do
we
delay
towards
evening
one
afternoon
in
the
latter
part
of
june
mary
returned
from
one
of
these
lonely
walks
by
the
sea
and
entered
the
kitchen
it
was
still
in
its
calm
and
sober
cleanness
tall
clock
ticked
with
a
startling
distinctness
from
the
door
of
her
mother
s
bedroom
which
stood
ajar
she
heard
the
chipper
of
miss
prissy
s
voice
she
stayed
her
light
footsteps
and
the
words
that
fell
on
her
ear
were
these
miss
marvyn
fainted
dead
away
stood
it
till
he
came
to
but
then
she
just
clapped
both
hands
together
as
if
she
d
been
shot
and
fell
right
forward
on
the
floor
in
a
faint
what
could
this
be
there
was
a
quick
intense
whirl
of
thoughts
in
mary
s
mind
and
then
came
one
of
those
awful
moments
when
the
powers
of
life
seem
to
make
a
dead
pause
and
all
things
stand
still
and
then
all
seemed
to
fail
under
her
and
the
life
to
sink
down
down
down
till
nothing
was
but
one
dim
vague
miserable
consciousness
scudder
and
miss
prissy
were
sitting
talking
earnestly
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
when
the
door
opened
noiselessly
and
mary
glided
to
them
like
a
spirit
colour
in
cheek
or
lip
blue
eyes
wide
with
calm
horror
and
laying
her
little
hand
with
a
nervous
grasp
on
miss
prissy
s
arm
she
said
tell
me
is
it
it
the
two
women
looked
at
each
other
and
then
scudder
opened
her
arms
my
daughter
oh
mother
mother
then
fell
that
long
hopeless
silence
broken
only
by
hysteric
sobs
from
miss
prissy
and
answering
ones
from
the
mother
but
lay
still
and
quiet
her
blue
eyes
wide
and
clear
making
an
inarticulate
moan
oh
are
they
it
be
he
dead
at
last
she
gasped
my
child
it
is
too
true
all
we
can
say
is
be
still
and
know
that
i
am
god
i
shall
to
be
still
mother
said
mary
with
a
piteous
hopeless
voice
like
the
bleat
of
a
dying
lamb
but
i
did
not
think
he
die
never
thought
of
that
never
of
it
mother
mother
mother
oh
what
shall
i
do
they
laid
her
on
her
mother
s
bed
first
and
last
of
broken
hearts
the
mother
sat
down
by
her
in
silence
miss
prissy
stole
away
into
the
doctor
s
study
and
told
him
all
that
had
happened
it
s
the
same
to
her
said
miss
prissy
with
womanly
reserve
as
if
he
d
been
an
own
what
was
his
spiritual
state
said
the
doctor
musingly
miss
prissy
looked
blank
and
answered
mournfully
i
don
t
the
doctor
entered
the
room
where
mary
was
lying
with
closed
eyes
those
few
moments
seemed
to
have
done
the
work
of
years
pale
and
faded
and
sunken
she
looked
nothing
but
the
painful
flutter
of
the
eyelids
and
lips
showed
that
she
yet
breathed
at
a
sign
from
scudder
he
kneeled
by
the
bed
and
began
to
pray
lord
thou
hast
been
our
in
all
generations
deep
mournful
upheaving
like
the
swell
of
the
ocean
surging
upward
under
the
pressure
of
mighty
sorrows
towards
an
almighty
heart
the
truly
good
are
of
one
language
in
prayer
whatever
lines
or
angles
of
thought
may
separate
them
in
other
hours
they
pray
in
all
good
men
pray
alike
the
emperor
charles
and
martin
luther
two
great
generals
of
opposite
faiths
breathed
out
their
dying
struggle
in
the
words
there
be
many
tongues
and
many
languages
of
men
the
language
of
prayer
is
one
by
itself
all
and
all
it
is
the
inspiration
of
that
spirit
that
is
ever
working
with
our
spirit
and
constantly
lifting
us
higher
than
we
know
and
by
our
wants
by
our
woes
by
our
tears
by
our
yearnings
by
our
poverty
urging
us
with
mightier
and
mightier
force
against
those
chains
of
sin
which
keep
us
from
our
god
we
speak
not
of
conventionally
called
prayers
mutterings
of
unawakened
spirits
talking
drowsily
in
sleep
of
such
prayers
as
come
when
flesh
and
heart
fail
in
mighty
straits
he
who
prays
is
a
prophet
and
a
mightier
than
he
speaks
in
him
for
the
helpeth
our
infirmities
for
we
know
not
what
we
should
pray
for
as
we
ought
but
the
spirit
itself
maketh
intercession
for
us
with
groanings
which
can
not
be
so
the
voice
of
supplication
upheaving
from
that
great
heart
so
childlike
in
its
humility
rose
with
a
wisdom
and
a
pathos
beyond
what
he
dreamed
in
his
intellectual
hours
it
uprose
even
as
a
strong
angel
whose
brow
is
solemnly
calm
and
whose
wings
shed
healing
dews
of
paradise
chapter
xxi
the
next
day
broke
calm
and
fair
the
robins
sang
remorselessly
in
the
and
were
answered
by
bobolink
oriole
and
a
whole
tribe
of
ignorant
little
bits
of
feathered
happiness
that
danced
among
the
leaves
golden
and
glorious
unclosed
those
purple
eyelids
of
the
east
and
regally
came
up
the
sun
and
the
treacherous
sea
broke
into
ten
thousand
smiles
laughing
and
dancing
with
every
ripple
as
unconsciously
as
if
no
form
dear
to
human
hearts
had
gone
down
beneath
it
oh
treacherous
deceiving
beauty
of
outward
things
beauty
wherein
throbs
not
one
answering
nerve
to
human
pain
mary
rose
early
and
was
about
her
morning
work
her
education
was
that
of
the
soldier
who
must
know
himself
no
more
whom
no
personal
pain
must
swerve
from
the
slightest
minutiæ
of
duty
so
she
was
there
at
her
usual
hour
dressed
with
the
same
cool
neatness
her
brown
hair
parted
in
satin
bands
and
only
the
colourless
cheek
and
lip
differing
from
the
mary
of
yesterday
how
strange
this
external
habit
of
living
one
thinks
how
to
stick
in
a
pin
and
how
to
tie
a
string
busies
one
s
self
with
folding
robes
and
putting
away
napkins
the
day
after
some
stroke
that
has
cut
the
inner
life
in
two
with
the
heart
s
blood
dropping
quietly
at
every
step
yet
it
is
better
so
happy
those
whom
stern
principle
or
long
habit
or
hard
necessity
calls
from
the
darkened
room
the
languid
trance
of
pain
in
which
the
wearied
heart
longs
to
indulge
and
gives
this
trite
prose
of
common
life
at
which
our
weak
and
wearied
appetites
so
revolt
mary
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
as
daughter
of
the
puritans
had
her
seed
within
her
aërial
in
her
delicacy
as
the
with
which
they
sowed
their
fields
she
had
yet
its
strong
fibre
which
no
stroke
of
the
flail
could
break
bruising
and
hackling
only
made
it
fitter
for
uses
of
homely
utility
mary
therefore
opened
the
at
dawn
and
after
standing
one
moment
to
breathe
the
freshness
began
spreading
the
cloth
for
an
early
breakfast
scudder
the
meanwhile
was
kneading
the
bread
that
had
been
set
to
rise
and
the
oven
was
crackling
and
roaring
with
a
honest
garrulousness
but
ever
and
anon
as
the
mother
worked
she
followed
the
motions
of
her
child
anxiously
mary
my
dear
she
said
the
eggs
are
giving
out
hadn
t
you
better
run
to
the
barn
and
get
a
few
most
mothers
are
instinctive
philosophers
no
treatise
on
the
laws
of
nervous
fluids
could
have
taught
scudder
a
better
for
this
morning
than
her
tender
gravity
and
her
constant
expedients
to
break
and
ripple
by
changing
employments
that
deep
deadly
of
thoughts
which
she
feared
might
undermine
her
child
s
life
mary
went
into
the
barn
stopped
a
moment
and
took
out
a
handful
of
corn
to
throw
to
her
hens
who
had
a
habit
of
running
towards
her
and
cocking
an
expectant
eye
to
her
little
hand
whenever
she
appeared
all
came
at
once
flying
towards
her
white
and
gleamy
with
hues
between
of
tawny
cocks
magnificent
with
the
waving
of
their
tails
as
they
chattered
and
cackled
and
pressed
and
crowded
about
her
pecking
the
corn
even
where
it
lodged
in
the
edge
of
her
little
shoes
she
said
poor
things
i
am
glad
they
enjoy
it
even
this
one
little
act
of
love
to
the
ignorant
fellowship
below
her
carried
away
some
of
the
choking
pain
which
seemed
all
the
while
suffocating
her
heart
then
climbing
into
the
hay
she
sought
the
nest
and
filled
her
little
basket
with
eggs
warm
translucent
in
their
freshness
she
felt
for
a
moment
the
customary
animation
in
surveying
her
new
treasures
but
suddenly
like
a
vision
rising
before
her
came
a
remembrance
of
once
when
she
and
james
were
children
together
and
had
been
seeking
eggs
just
there
he
flashed
before
her
eyes
the
bright
boy
with
the
long
black
lashes
the
dimpled
cheeks
the
merry
eyes
just
as
he
stood
and
threw
the
hay
over
her
when
they
tumbled
and
laughed
together
she
sat
down
with
a
sick
faintness
and
then
turned
and
walked
wearily
in
chapter
xxii
mary
returned
to
the
house
with
her
basket
of
warm
fresh
eggs
which
she
set
down
mournfully
upon
the
table
in
her
heart
there
was
one
conscious
want
and
yearning
and
that
was
to
go
to
the
friends
of
him
she
had
go
to
his
mother
the
first
impulse
of
bereavement
is
to
stretch
out
the
hands
towards
what
was
nearest
and
dearest
to
the
departed
her
dove
came
fluttering
down
out
of
the
tree
and
settled
on
her
hand
and
began
asking
in
his
dumb
way
to
be
noticed
mary
stroked
his
white
feathers
and
bent
her
head
down
over
them
till
they
were
wet
with
tears
oh
birdie
you
live
but
he
is
gone
she
said
then
suddenly
putting
it
gently
from
her
and
going
near
and
throwing
her
arms
around
her
mother
s
neck
mother
she
said
i
want
to
go
up
to
cousin
ellen
this
was
the
familiar
name
by
which
she
always
called
mrs
marvyn
can
t
you
go
with
me
mother
my
daughter
i
have
thought
of
it
i
hurried
about
my
baking
this
morning
and
sent
word
to
jenkyns
that
he
needn
t
come
to
see
about
the
chimney
because
i
expected
to
go
as
soon
as
breakfast
should
be
out
of
the
way
so
hurry
now
boil
some
eggs
and
get
on
the
cold
beef
and
potatoes
for
i
see
solomon
and
amaziah
coming
in
with
the
milk
they
ll
want
their
breakfast
the
breakfast
for
the
hired
men
was
soon
arranged
on
the
table
and
mary
sat
down
to
preside
while
her
mother
was
going
on
with
her
baking
introducing
various
loaves
of
white
and
brown
bread
into
the
capacious
oven
by
means
of
a
long
iron
shovel
and
discoursing
at
intervals
with
solomon
with
regard
to
the
different
farming
operations
which
he
had
in
hand
for
the
day
solomon
was
a
tall
man
brawny
and
angular
with
a
face
tanned
by
the
sun
and
graven
with
those
considerate
lines
which
new
england
so
early
writes
on
the
faces
of
her
sons
he
was
reputed
an
oracle
in
matters
of
agriculture
and
cattle
and
like
oracles
generally
was
prudently
sparing
of
his
responses
amaziah
was
one
of
those
uncouth
boys
of
eighteen
whose
physical
bulk
appears
to
have
so
suddenly
developed
that
the
soul
has
more
matter
than
she
has
learned
to
recognize
so
that
the
hapless
individual
is
always
awkwardly
conscious
of
too
much
limb
and
in
amaziah
s
case
this
consciousness
grew
particularly
distressing
when
mary
was
in
the
room
he
liked
to
have
her
there
he
said
but
somehow
she
was
so
white
and
pretty
she
made
him
feel
sort
o
of
course
as
such
poor
mortals
always
do
he
must
on
this
particular
morning
blunder
into
precisely
the
wrong
subject
s
pose
you
ve
heerd
the
news
that
jeduthan
pettibone
brought
home
in
the
flying
scud
bout
the
wreck
o
the
monsoon
it
s
an
awful
providence
that
ar
n
t
it
why
jeduthan
says
she
jest
crushed
like
an
with
that
amaziah
illustrated
the
fact
by
crushing
an
in
his
great
brown
hand
mary
did
not
answer
she
could
not
grow
any
paler
than
she
was
before
a
dreadful
curiosity
came
over
her
but
her
lips
could
frame
no
question
amaziah
went
on
ye
see
the
cap
en
he
got
killed
with
a
spar
when
the
blow
fust
come
on
and
jim
marvyn
he
commanded
and
jeduthan
says
that
he
seemed
to
have
the
spirit
of
ten
men
in
him
he
worked
and
he
watched
and
he
was
everywhere
at
once
and
he
kep
em
all
up
for
three
days
till
finally
they
lost
their
rudder
and
went
drivin
right
onto
the
rocks
when
they
come
in
sight
he
come
up
on
deck
and
says
he
well
my
boys
we
re
headin
right
into
eternity

he
and
our
chances
for
this
world

but
we
ll
all
have
one
try
for
our
lives
boys
i

tried
to
do
my
duty
by
you
and
the
god

will
be
done
all

have
to
ask

is
that
if

to
shore
you
ll
find
my
mother
and
tell
her
i
died
thinkin
of
her
and
father
and
my
dear
that
was
the
last
jeduthan
saw
of
him
for
in
a
few
minutes
more
the
ship
struck
and
then
it
was
every
man
for
himself
laws
jeduthan
says
there
couldn
t
nobody
have
stood
beatin
agin
them
rocks
unless
they
was
all
leather
and
like
him
why
he
says
the
waves
would
take
strong
men
and
jest
crush
em
against
the
rocks
like
smashin
a
here
mary
s
paleness
became
livid
she
made
a
hasty
motion
to
rise
from
the
table
and
solomon
trod
on
the
foot
of
the
narrator
you
seem
to
forget
that
friends
and
relations
has
feelin
s
he
said
as
mary
hastily
went
into
her
own
room
amaziah
suddenly
awakened
to
the
fact
that
he
had
been
trespassing
sat
with
mouth
half
open
and
a
stupefied
look
of
perplexity
on
his
face
for
a
moment
and
then
rising
hastily
said
well
sol
i
guess
i
ll
go
an
yoke
up
the
at
eight
o
clock
all
the
morning
toils
were
over
the
wide
kitchen
cool
and
still
and
the
waggon
standing
at
the
door
into
which
climbed
mary
her
mother
and
the
doctor
for
though
invested
with
no
spiritual
authority
and
charged
with
no
ritual
or
form
for
hours
of
affliction
the
religion
of
new
england
always
expects
her
minister
as
a
first
visitor
in
every
house
of
mourning
the
ride
was
a
sorrowful
and
silent
one
the
doctor
propped
upon
his
cane
seemed
to
reflect
deeply
have
you
been
at
all
conversant
with
the
exercises
of
our
young
friend
s
mind
on
the
subject
of
religion
he
asked
scudder
did
not
at
first
reply
the
remembrance
of
james
s
last
letter
flashed
over
her
mind
and
she
felt
the
vibration
of
the
frail
child
beside
her
in
whom
every
nerve
was
quivering
after
a
moment
she
said
it
does
not
become
us
to
judge
the
spiritual
state
of
any
one
james
s
mind
was
in
an
unsettled
way
when
he
left
but
who
can
say
what
wonders
may
have
been
effected
by
divine
grace
since
then
this
conversation
fell
on
the
soul
of
mary
like
the
sound
of
clods
falling
on
a
coffin
to
the
ear
of
one
buried
alive
she
heard
it
with
a
dull
smothering
sense
of
suffocation
question
to
be
raised
about
one
too
for
whom
she
could
have
given
her
own
soul
at
this
moment
she
felt
how
idle
is
the
mere
hope
or
promise
of
personal
salvation
made
to
one
who
has
passed
beyond
the
life
of
self
and
struck
deep
the
roots
of
his
existence
in
others
she
did
not
utter
a
could
she
a
faintest
shadow
of
a
such
a
case
falls
on
the
soul
with
the
weight
of
mountain
certainty
and
in
that
short
ride
she
felt
what
an
infinite
pain
may
be
locked
in
one
small
silent
breast
the
waggon
drew
up
to
the
house
of
mourning
cato
stood
at
the
gate
and
came
forward
officiously
to
help
them
out
mass
r
and
missis
will
be
glad
to
see
you
he
said
it
s
a
drefful
stroke
has
come
upon
candace
appeared
at
the
door
there
was
a
majesty
of
sorrow
in
her
bearing
as
she
received
them
she
said
not
a
word
but
pointed
with
her
finger
towards
the
inner
room
but
as
mary
lifted
up
her
faded
weary
face
to
hers
her
whole
soul
seemed
to
heave
towards
her
like
a
billow
and
she
took
her
up
in
her
arms
and
broke
forth
into
sobbing
and
carrying
her
in
as
if
she
had
been
a
child
set
her
down
in
the
inner
room
and
sat
down
beside
her
marvyn
and
her
husband
sat
together
holding
each
other
s
hands
the
open
bible
between
them
for
a
few
moments
nothing
was
to
be
heard
but
sobs
and
unrestrained
weeping
and
then
all
kneeled
down
while
the
doctor
prayed
after
they
rose
up
zebedee
marvyn
stood
for
a
moment
thoughtfully
and
then
said
if
it
had
pleased
the
lord
to
give
me
a
sure
evidence
of
my
son
s
salvation
i
could
have
given
him
up
with
all
my
heart
but
now
whatever
there
may
be
i
have
seen
he
stood
in
an
attitude
of
hopeless
dejection
which
contrasted
painfully
with
his
usual
upright
carriage
and
the
firm
lines
of
his
face
marvyn
started
as
if
a
sword
had
pierced
her
passed
her
arm
round
mary
s
waist
with
a
strong
nervous
clasp
unlike
her
usual
calm
self
and
said
stay
with
me
daughter
with
me
mary
can
stay
as
long
as
you
wish
cousin
said
scudder
we
have
nothing
to
call
her
with
me
said
marvyn
to
mary
opening
an
adjoining
door
into
her
bedroom
and
drawing
her
in
with
a
sort
of
suppressed
vehemence
i
want
you
must
have
you
mrs
marvyn
s
state
alarms
me
said
her
husband
looking
apprehensively
after
her
when
the
door
was
closed
she
has
not
shed
any
tears
nor
slept
any
since
she
heard
this
news
you
know
that
her
mind
has
been
in
a
peculiar
and
unhappy
state
with
regard
to
religious
things
for
many
years
i
was
in
hopes
she
might
feel
free
to
open
her
exercises
of
mind
to
the
perhaps
she
will
feel
more
freedom
with
mary
said
the
doctor
there
is
no
healing
for
such
troubles
except
in
unconditional
submission
to
infinite
wisdom
and
goodness
the
lord
reigneth
and
will
at
last
bring
infinite
good
out
of
evil
whether
small
portion
of
existence
be
included
or
after
a
few
moments
more
of
conference
scudder
and
the
doctor
departed
leaving
mary
alone
in
the
house
of
mourning
chapter
xxiii
we
have
said
before
what
we
now
repeat
that
it
is
impossible
to
write
a
story
of
new
england
life
and
manners
for
superficial
thought
or
shallow
feeling
they
who
would
fully
understand
the
springs
which
moved
the
characters
with
whom
we
now
associate
must
go
down
with
us
to
the
very
depths
never
was
there
a
community
where
the
roots
of
common
life
shot
down
so
deeply
and
were
so
intensely
grappled
around
things
sublime
and
eternal
the
founders
of
it
were
a
body
of
confessors
and
martyrs
who
turned
their
backs
on
the
whole
glory
of
the
visible
to
found
in
the
wilderness
a
republic
of
which
the
god
of
heaven
and
earth
should
be
the
sovereign
power
for
the
first
hundred
years
grew
this
community
shut
out
by
a
fathomless
ocean
from
the
existing
world
and
divided
by
an
antagonism
not
less
deep
from
all
the
reigning
ideas
of
nominal
christendom
in
a
community
thus
unworldly
must
have
arisen
a
mode
of
thought
energetic
original
and
sublime
the
leaders
of
thought
and
feeling
were
the
ministry
and
we
boldly
assert
that
the
spectacle
of
the
early
ministry
of
new
england
was
one
to
which
the
world
gives
no
parallel
living
an
intense
earnest
practical
life
mostly
tilling
the
earth
with
their
own
hands
they
yet
carried
on
the
most
startling
and
original
religious
investigations
with
a
simplicity
that
might
have
been
deemed
audacious
were
it
not
so
reverential
all
old
issues
relating
to
government
religion
ritual
and
forms
of
church
organization
having
for
them
passed
away
they
went
straight
to
the
heart
of
things
and
boldly
confronted
the
problem
of
universal
being
they
had
come
out
from
the
world
as
witnesses
to
the
most
solemn
and
sacred
of
human
rights
they
had
accustomed
themselves
boldly
to
challenge
and
dispute
all
sham
pretensions
and
idolatries
of
past
question
the
right
of
kings
in
the
state
and
of
prelates
in
the
church
and
now
they
turned
the
same
bold
inquiries
towards
the
eternal
throne
and
threw
down
their
glove
in
the
lists
as
authorized
defenders
of
every
mystery
in
the
eternal
government
the
task
they
proposed
to
themselves
was
that
of
reconciling
the
most
tremendous
facts
of
sin
and
evil
present
and
eternal
with
those
conceptions
of
infinite
power
and
benevolence
which
their
own
strong
and
generous
natures
enabled
them
so
vividly
to
realize
in
the
intervals
of
planting
and
harvesting
they
were
busy
with
the
toils
of
adjusting
the
laws
of
a
universe
solemnly
simple
they
made
long
journeys
in
their
old
chaises
to
settle
with
each
other
some
nice
point
of
celestial
jurisprudence
and
to
compare
their
maps
of
the
infinite
their
letters
to
each
other
form
a
literature
altogether
unique
hopkins
sends
to
edwards
the
younger
his
scheme
of
the
universe
in
which
he
starts
with
the
proposition
that
god
is
infinitely
above
all
obligations
of
any
kind
to
his
creatures
edwards
replies
with
the
brusque
comment
this
is
wrong
god
has
no
more
right
to
injure
a
creature
than
a
creature
has
to
injure
god
and
each
probably
about
that
time
preached
a
sermon
on
his
own
views
which
was
discussed
by
every
farmer
in
intervals
of
plough
and
hoe
by
every
woman
and
girl
at
loom
or
new
england
was
one
vast
sea
surging
from
depths
to
heights
with
thought
and
discussion
on
the
most
insoluble
of
mysteries
and
it
is
to
be
added
that
no
man
or
woman
accepted
any
theory
or
speculation
simply
theory
or
speculation
all
was
profoundly
real
and
foundation
on
which
actual
life
was
based
with
intensest
earnestness
the
views
of
human
existence
which
resulted
from
this
course
of
training
were
gloomy
enough
to
oppress
any
heart
which
did
not
rise
above
them
by
triumphant
faith
or
sink
below
them
by
brutish
insensibility
for
they
included
every
moral
problem
of
natural
or
revealed
religion
divested
of
all
those
softening
poetries
and
tender
draperies
which
forms
ceremonies
and
rituals
had
thrown
around
them
in
other
parts
and
ages
of
christendom
the
human
race
without
exception
coming
into
existence
under
god
s
wrath
and
curse
with
a
nature
so
fatally
disordered
that
although
perfect
free
agents
men
were
infallibly
certain
to
do
nothing
to
divine
acceptance
until
regenerated
by
the
supernatural
aid
of
god
s
spirit
this
aid
being
given
to
a
certain
decreed
number
of
the
human
race
only
the
rest
with
enough
free
agency
to
make
them
responsible
but
without
this
indispensable
assistance
exposed
to
the
malignant
assaults
of
evil
spirits
versed
in
every
art
of
temptation
were
sure
to
fall
hopelessly
into
perdition
the
standard
of
what
constituted
a
true
regeneration
as
presented
in
such
treatises
as
edwards
on
the
affections
and
others
of
the
times
made
this
change
to
be
something
so
high
disinterested
and
superhuman
so
removed
from
all
natural
and
common
habits
and
feelings
that
the
most
earnest
and
devoted
whose
whole
life
had
been
a
constant
travail
of
endeavour
a
tissue
of
almost
unearthly
disinterestedness
often
lived
and
died
with
only
a
glimmering
hope
of
its
attainment
according
to
any
views
then
entertained
of
the
evidences
of
a
true
regeneration
the
number
of
the
whole
human
race
who
could
be
supposed
as
yet
to
have
received
this
grace
was
so
small
that
as
to
any
numerical
valuation
it
must
have
been
expressed
by
an
infinitesimal
hopkins
in
many
places
distinctly
recognizes
the
fact
that
the
greater
part
of
the
human
race
up
to
his
time
had
been
eternally
lost
and
boldly
assumes
the
ground
that
this
amount
of
sin
and
suffering
being
the
best
and
most
necessary
means
of
the
greatest
final
amount
of
happiness
was
not
merely
permitted
but
distinctly
chosen
decreed
and
provided
for
as
essential
in
the
schemes
of
infinite
benevolence
he
held
that
this
decree
not
only
each
individual
act
of
sin
but
also
took
measures
to
make
it
certain
though
by
an
exercise
of
infinite
skill
it
accomplished
this
result
without
violating
human
free
agency
the
preaching
of
those
times
was
animated
by
an
unflinching
consistency
which
never
shrank
from
carrying
an
idea
to
its
remotest
logical
verge
the
sufferings
of
the
lost
were
not
kept
from
view
but
proclaimed
with
a
terrible
power
hopkins
boldly
asserts
that
all
the
use
which
god
will
have
for
them
is
to
suffer
this
is
all
the
end
they
can
answer
therefore
all
their
faculties
and
their
whole
capacities
will
be
employed
and
used
for
this
end
the
body
can
by
omnipotence
be
made
capable
of
suffering
the
greatest
imaginable
pain
without
producing
dissolution
or
abating
the
least
degree
of
life
or
sensibility
one
way
in
which
god
will
show
his
power
in
the
punishment
of
the
wicked
will
be
in
strengthening
and
upholding
their
bodies
and
souls
in
torments
which
otherwise
would
be
the
sermons
preached
by
president
edwards
on
this
subject
are
so
terrific
in
their
refined
poetry
of
torture
that
very
few
persons
of
quick
sensibility
could
read
them
through
without
agony
and
it
is
related
that
when
in
those
calm
and
tender
tones
which
never
rose
to
passionate
enunciation
he
read
these
discourses
the
house
was
often
filled
with
shrieks
and
wailings
and
that
a
brother
minister
once
laid
hold
of
his
skirts
exclaiming
in
an
involuntary
agony
oh
edwards
edwards
is
god
not
a
god
of
mercy
not
that
these
men
were
indifferent
or
insensible
to
the
dread
words
they
spoke
their
whole
lives
and
deportment
bore
thrilling
witness
to
their
sincerity
edwards
set
apart
special
days
of
fasting
in
view
of
the
dreadful
doom
of
the
lost
in
which
he
was
wont
to
walk
the
floor
weeping
and
wringing
his
hands
hopkins
fasted
every
saturday
david
brainerd
gave
up
every
refinement
of
civilized
life
to
weep
and
pray
at
the
feet
of
hardened
savages
if
by
any
means
he
might
save
all
by
lives
of
eminent
purity
and
earnestness
gave
awful
weight
and
sanction
to
their
words
if
we
add
to
this
statement
the
fact
that
it
was
always
proposed
to
every
inquiring
soul
as
an
evidence
of
regeneration
that
it
should
truly
and
heartily
accept
all
the
ways
of
god
thus
declared
right
and
lovely
and
from
the
heart
submit
to
him
as
the
only
just
and
good
it
will
be
seen
what
materials
of
tremendous
internal
conflict
and
agitation
were
all
the
while
working
in
every
bosom
almost
all
the
histories
of
religious
experience
of
those
times
relate
paroxysms
of
opposition
to
god
and
fierce
rebellion
expressed
in
language
which
appals
the
very
soul
followed
at
length
by
mysterious
elevations
of
faith
and
reactions
of
confiding
love
the
result
of
divine
interposition
which
carried
the
soul
far
above
the
region
of
the
intellect
into
that
of
direct
spiritual
intuition
president
edwards
records
that
he
was
once
in
this
state
of
enmity
that
the
facts
of
the
divine
administration
seemed
horrible
to
him
and
that
this
opposition
was
overcome
by
no
course
of
reasoning
but
by
an
and
sweet
which
came
to
him
once
when
walking
alone
in
the
fields
and
looking
up
into
the
blue
sky
he
saw
the
blending
of
the
divine
majesty
with
a
calm
sweet
and
almost
infinite
meekness
the
piety
which
grew
up
under
such
a
system
was
of
necessity
energetic
it
was
the
uprousing
of
the
whole
energy
of
the
human
soul
pierced
and
wrenched
and
probed
from
her
lowest
depths
to
her
topmost
heights
with
every
awful
possible
to
existence
he
whose
faith
in
god
came
clear
through
these
terrible
tests
would
be
sure
never
to
know
greater
ones
he
might
certainly
challenge
earth
or
heaven
things
present
or
things
to
come
to
swerve
him
from
this
grand
allegiance
but
it
is
to
be
conceded
that
these
systems
so
admirable
in
relation
to
the
energy
earnestness
and
acuteness
of
their
authors
when
received
as
absolute
truth
and
as
a
basis
of
actual
life
had
on
minds
of
a
certain
class
the
effect
of
a
slow
poison
producing
of
morbid
action
very
different
from
any
which
ever
followed
the
simple
reading
of
the
bible
they
differ
from
the
new
testament
as
the
living
embrace
of
a
friend
does
from
his
lifeless
body
mapped
out
under
the
knife
of
the
anatomical
demonstrator
every
nerve
and
muscle
is
there
but
to
a
sensitive
spirit
there
is
the
very
chill
of
death
in
the
analysis
all
systems
that
deal
with
the
infinite
are
besides
exposed
to
danger
from
small
unsuspected
admixtures
of
human
error
which
become
deadly
when
carried
to
such
vast
results
the
smallest
speck
of
earth
s
dust
in
the
focus
of
an
infinite
lens
appears
magnified
among
the
heavenly
orbs
as
a
frightful
monster
thus
it
happened
that
while
strong
spirits
walked
with
victorious
hymns
along
these
sublime
paths
feebler
and
more
sensitive
ones
lay
along
the
track
bleeding
away
in
despair
fearful
to
them
were
the
shadows
that
lay
over
the
cradle
and
the
grave
the
mother
clasped
her
babe
to
her
bosom
and
looked
with
shuddering
to
the
awful
coming
trial
of
free
agency
with
its
terrible
responsibilities
and
risks
and
as
she
thought
of
the
infinite
chances
against
her
beloved
almost
wished
it
might
die
in
infancy
but
when
the
stroke
of
death
came
and
some
young
thoughtless
head
was
laid
suddenly
low
who
can
say
what
silent
anguish
of
loving
hearts
sounded
the
dread
depths
of
eternity
with
the
awful
question
in
no
other
time
or
place
of
christendom
have
so
fearful
issues
been
presented
to
the
mind
some
church
interposed
its
protecting
shield
the
christian
born
and
baptized
child
was
supposed
in
some
wise
rescued
from
the
curse
of
the
fall
and
related
to
the
great
redemption
to
be
a
member
of
christ
s
family
and
if
ever
so
sinful
still
infolded
in
some
vague
sphere
of
hope
and
protection
augustine
solaced
the
dread
anxieties
of
trembling
love
by
prayers
offered
for
the
dead
in
times
when
the
church
above
and
on
earth
presented
itself
to
the
eye
of
the
mourner
as
a
great
assembly
with
one
accord
lifting
interceding
hands
for
the
parted
soul
but
the
clear
logic
and
intense
individualism
of
new
england
deepened
the
problems
of
the
augustinian
faith
while
they
swept
away
all
those
softening
provisions
so
earnestly
clasped
to
the
throbbing
heart
of
that
great
poet
of
theology
no
rite
no
form
no
paternal
relation
no
faith
or
prayer
of
church
earthly
or
heavenly
interposed
the
slightest
shield
between
the
trembling
spirit
and
eternal
justice
the
individual
entered
eternity
alone
as
if
he
had
no
interceding
relation
the
universe
this
then
was
the
awful
dread
which
was
constantly
underlying
life
this
it
was
which
caused
the
tolling
bell
in
green
hollows
and
lonely
dells
to
be
a
sound
which
shook
the
soul
and
searched
the
heart
with
fearful
questions
and
this
it
was
that
was
lying
with
mountain
weight
on
the
soul
of
the
mother
too
keenly
agonized
to
feel
that
doubt
in
such
a
case
was
any
less
a
torture
than
the
most
dreadful
certainty
hers
was
a
nature
more
reasoning
than
creative
and
poetic
and
whatever
she
believed
bound
her
mind
in
strictest
chains
to
its
logical
results
she
delighted
in
the
regions
of
mathematical
knowledge
and
walked
them
as
a
native
home
but
the
commerce
with
abstract
certainties
fitted
her
mind
still
more
to
be
stiffened
and
enchained
by
glacial
reasonings
in
regions
where
spiritual
intuitions
are
as
necessary
as
wings
to
birds
mary
was
by
nature
of
the
class
who
never
reason
abstractly
whose
intellections
all
begin
in
the
heart
which
sends
them
coloured
with
its
warm
to
the
brain
her
perceptions
of
the
same
subjects
were
as
different
from
marvyn
s
as
his
who
revels
only
in
colour
from
his
who
is
busy
with
the
dry
details
of
mere
outline
the
one
mind
was
arranged
like
a
map
and
the
other
like
a
picture
in
all
the
system
which
had
been
explained
to
her
her
mind
selected
points
on
which
it
seized
with
intense
sympathy
which
it
dwelt
upon
and
expanded
till
all
else
fell
away
the
sublimity
of
disinterested
benevolence
the
harmony
and
order
of
a
system
tending
in
its
final
results
to
infinite
happiness
the
goodness
of
god
the
love
of
a
redeemer
were
all
so
many
glorious
pictures
which
she
revolved
in
her
mind
with
small
care
for
their
logical
relations
marvyn
had
never
in
all
the
course
of
their
intimacy
opened
her
mouth
to
mary
on
the
subject
of
religion
it
was
not
an
uncommon
incident
of
those
times
for
persons
of
great
elevation
and
purity
of
character
to
be
familiarly
known
and
spoken
of
as
living
under
a
cloud
of
religious
gloom
and
it
was
simply
regarded
as
one
more
mysterious
instance
of
the
workings
of
that
infinite
decree
which
denied
to
them
the
special
illumination
of
the
spirit
when
marvyn
had
drawn
mary
with
her
into
her
room
she
seemed
like
a
person
almost
in
frenzy
she
shut
and
bolted
the
door
drew
her
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
throwing
her
arms
round
her
rested
her
hot
and
throbbing
forehead
on
her
shoulder
she
pressed
her
thin
hand
over
her
eyes
and
then
suddenly
drawing
back
looked
her
in
the
face
as
one
resolved
to
speak
something
long
suppressed
her
soft
brown
eyes
had
a
flash
of
despairing
wildness
in
them
like
that
of
a
hunted
animal
turning
in
its
on
its
pursuer
mary
she
said
i
can
t
help
it
t
mind
what
i
say
but
i
must
speak
or
die
mary
i
can
not
will
not
be
resigned
is
all
hard
unjust
cruel
all
eternity
i
will
say
so
to
me
there
is
no
goodness
no
justice
no
mercy
in
anything
life
seems
to
me
the
most
tremendous
doom
that
can
be
inflicted
on
a
helpless
being
had
we
that
it
should
be
sent
upon
us
why
were
we
made
to
love
so
to
hope
so
hearts
so
full
of
feeling
and
all
the
laws
of
nature
marching
over
us
stopping
for
our
agony
why
we
can
suffer
so
in
this
life
that
we
had
better
never
have
been
born
but
mary
think
what
a
moment
life
is
think
of
those
awful
ages
of
eternity
and
then
think
of
all
god
s
power
and
knowledge
used
on
the
lost
to
make
them
suffer
think
that
all
but
the
merest
fragment
of
mankind
have
gone
into
this
are
in
it
now
the
number
of
the
elect
is
so
small
we
can
scarce
count
them
for
anything
think
what
noble
minds
what
warm
generous
hearts
what
splendid
natures
are
wrecked
and
thrown
away
by
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
how
we
love
each
other
how
our
hearts
weave
into
each
other
how
more
than
glad
we
should
be
to
die
for
each
other
and
all
this
god
how
must
it
end
mary
it
isn
t
sorrow
only
what
right
have
i
to
mourn
is
son
any
better
than
any
other
mother
s
son
thousands
of
thousands
whose
mothers
loved
them
as
i
loved
mine
are
gone
there
oh
my
why
did
they
rejoice
brides
should
wear
mourning
the
bells
should
toll
for
every
wedding
every
new
family
is
built
over
this
awful
pit
of
despair
and
only
one
in
a
thousand
escapes
pale
aghast
mary
stood
dumb
as
one
who
in
the
dark
and
storm
sees
by
the
sudden
glare
of
lightning
a
chasm
yawning
under
foot
it
was
amazement
and
dimness
of
anguish
the
dreadful
words
struck
on
the
very
centre
where
her
soul
rested
she
felt
as
if
the
point
of
a
wedge
were
being
driven
between
her
life
and
her
life
s
life
between
her
and
her
god
she
clasped
her
hands
instinctively
on
her
bosom
as
if
to
hold
there
some
cherished
image
and
said
in
a
piercing
voice
of
supplication
god
god
oh
where
art
thou
marvyn
walked
up
and
down
the
room
with
a
vivid
spot
of
red
in
each
cheek
and
a
baleful
fire
in
her
eyes
talking
in
rapid
soliloquy
scarcely
regarding
her
listener
absorbed
in
her
own
enkindled
thoughts
dr
hopkins
says
that
this
is
all
best
better
than
it
would
have
been
in
any
other
possible
way
that
god
it
because
it
was
for
a
greater
final
good
that
he
not
only
chose
it
but
took
means
to
make
it
certain
that
he
ordains
every
sin
and
does
all
that
is
necessary
to
make
it
certain
that
he
creates
the
vessels
of
wrath
and
fits
them
for
destruction
and
that
he
has
an
infinite
knowledge
by
which
he
can
do
it
without
violating
their
free
agency
so
much
the
worse
what
a
use
of
infinite
knowledge
what
if
men
should
do
so
what
if
a
father
should
take
means
to
make
it
certain
that
his
poor
little
child
should
be
an
abandoned
wretch
without
violating
his
free
agency
so
much
the
worse
i
say
they
say
he
does
this
so
that
he
may
show
to
all
eternity
by
their
example
the
evil
nature
of
sin
and
its
consequences
this
is
all
that
the
greater
part
of
the
human
race
have
been
used
for
yet
and
it
is
all
right
because
an
overplus
of
infinite
happiness
is
yet
to
be
wrought
out
by
it
it
is
right
no
possible
amount
of
good
to
ever
so
many
can
make
it
right
to
deprave
ever
so
few
happiness
and
misery
can
not
be
measured
so
i
never
can
think
it
right
never
yet
they
say
our
salvation
depends
on
our
loving
god
loving
him
better
than
ourselves
loving
him
better
than
our
dearest
friends
it
is
impossible
it
is
contrary
to
the
laws
of
my
nature
i
can
never
love
god
i
can
never
praise
him
i
am
lost
lost
lost
and
what
is
worse
i
can
not
redeem
my
friends
oh
i
suffer
for
ever
how
willingly
if
i
could
save
but
oh
eternity
eternity
frightful
unspeakable
woe
no
end
no
bottom
no
shore
no
hope
o
god

septr
marvyn
s
eyes
grew
wilder
walked
the
floor
wringing
her
hands
her
words
mingled
with
shrieks
and
moans
became
whirling
and
confused
as
when
in
autumn
a
storm
drives
the
leaves
in
dizzy
mazes
mary
was
alarmed
ecstasy
of
despair
was
just
verging
on
insanity

rushed
out
and
called

said

from

he
sat
reading

an

of
heartbroken
dejection

with

light

said

the
sudden
shock
of
these
scenes
was
followed
in
marvyn
s
case
by
a
low
lingering
fever
her
room
was
darkened
and
she
lay
on
her
bed
a
pale
suffering
form
with
scarcely
the
ability
to
raise
her
hand
the
shimmering
twilight
of
the
fell
on
white
napkins
spread
over
stands
where
constantly
appeared
new
vials
big
and
little
as
the
physician
made
his
daily
visit
and
prescribed
now
this
drug
and
now
that
for
a
wound
that
had
struck
through
the
soul
mary
remained
many
days
at
the
white
house
because
to
the
invalid
no
step
no
voice
no
hand
was
like
hers
we
see
her
there
now
as
she
sits
in
the
glimmering
by
the
head
a
little
drooped
as
droops
a
snowdrop
over
a
grave
ray
of
light
from
a
round
hole
in
the
closed
shutters
falls
on
her
hair
her
small
hands
clasped
on
her
knees
her
mouth
has
lines
of
sad
compression
and
in
her
eyes
are
infinite
questionings
chapter
xxiv
when
marvyn
began
to
amend
mary
returned
to
the
home
cottage
and
resumed
the
details
of
her
industrious
and
quiet
life
between
her
and
her
two
best
friends
had
fallen
a
curtain
of
silence
the
subject
that
filled
all
her
thoughts
could
not
be
named
between
them
the
doctor
often
looked
at
her
pale
cheeks
and
drooping
form
with
a
face
of
honest
sorrow
and
heaved
deep
sighs
as
she
passed
but
he
did
not
find
any
power
within
himself
by
which
he
could
approach
her
when
he
would
speak
and
she
turned
her
sad
patient
eyes
so
gently
on
him
the
words
went
back
again
to
his
heart
and
there
taking
a
second
thought
spread
upward
wing
in
prayer
scudder
sometimes
came
to
her
room
after
she
was
gone
to
bed
and
found
her
weeping
and
when
gently
she
urged
her
to
sleep
she
would
wipe
her
eyes
so
patiently
and
turn
her
head
with
such
obedient
sweetness
that
her
mother
s
heart
utterly
failed
her
for
hours
mary
sat
in
her
room
with
james
s
last
letter
spread
out
before
her
how
anxiously
had
she
studied
every
word
and
phrase
in
it
weighing
them
to
see
if
the
hope
of
eternal
life
were
in
them
how
she
dwelt
on
those
last
promises
had
he
kept
them
ah
to
die
without
one
word
more
would
no
angel
tell
her
not
the
loving
god
who
knew
all
just
whisper
one
word
he
must
have
read
the
little
bible
what
had
he
thought
what
did
he
feel
in
that
awful
hour
when
he
felt
himself
drifting
on
to
that
fearful
eternity
perhaps
he
had
been
regenerated
there
had
been
a
sudden
change
knows
had
read
of
such
things
in
that
perhaps
lies
a
world
of
anguish
love
will
not
hear
of
it
love
for
certainty
against
an
uncertainty
who
can
brace
the
soul
we
put
all
our
forces
of
faith
and
prayer
against
it
and
it
goes
down
just
as
a
buoy
sinks
in
the
water
and
the
next
moment
it
is
up
again
the
soul
fatigues
itself
with
efforts
which
come
and
go
in
waves
and
when
with
laborious
care
she
has
adjusted
all
things
in
the
light
of
hope
back
flows
the
tide
and
sweeps
all
away
in
such
struggles
life
spends
itself
fast
an
inward
wound
does
not
carry
one
deathward
more
surely
than
this
worst
wound
of
the
soul
god
has
made
us
so
mercifully
that
there
is
no
however
dreadful
to
which
do
not
in
time
adjust
themselves
to
uncertainty
there
is
no
possible
adjustment
where
is
he
oh
question
of
questions
which
we
suppress
but
which
a
power
of
infinite
force
still
urges
on
the
soul
who
feels
a
part
of
herself
torn
away
mary
sat
at
her
window
in
evening
hours
and
watched
the
slanting
sunbeams
through
the
green
blades
of
grass
and
thought
one
year
ago
he
stood
there
with
his
manly
form
his
bright
eye
his
buoyant
hope
his
victorious
mastery
of
life
and
where
was
he
now
was
his
heart
as
sick
longing
for
her
as
hers
for
him
was
he
looking
back
to
earth
and
its
joys
with
pangs
of
unutterable
regret
or
had
a
divine
power
interpenetrated
his
soul
and
lighted
there
the
flame
of
a
celestial
love
which
bore
him
far
above
earth
if
he
were
among
the
lost
in
what
age
of
eternity
could
she
ever
be
blessed
could
christ
be
happy
if
those
who
were
one
with
him
were
sinful
and
accursed
and
could
christ
s
own
loved
ones
be
happy
when
those
with
whom
they
have
exchanged
being
in
whom
they
live
and
feel
are
as
wandering
stars
for
whom
is
reserved
the
mist
of
darkness
for
ever
she
had
been
taught
that
the
agonies
of
the
lost
would
be
for
ever
in
sight
of
the
saints
without
abating
in
the
least
their
eternal
joys
nay
that
they
would
find
in
it
increasing
motives
to
praise
and
adoration
could
it
be
so
would
the
last
act
of
the
great
bridegroom
of
the
church
be
to
strike
from
the
heart
of
his
purified
bride
those
yearnings
of
love
which
his
whole
example
had
taught
her
and
in
which
she
reflected
as
in
a
glass
his
own
nature
if
not
is
there
not
some
provision
by
which
those
roots
of
deathless
love
which
christ
s
betrothed
ones
strike
into
other
hearts
shall
have
a
divine
redeeming
power
question
vital
as
to
ten
thousand
hearts
mothers
wives
husbands
all
who
feel
the
infinite
sacredness
of
love
after
the
first
interview
with
marvyn
the
subject
which
had
so
agitated
them
was
not
renewed
she
had
risen
at
last
from
her
as
thin
and
shadowy
as
a
faded
moon
after
sunrise
candace
often
shook
her
head
mournfully
as
her
eyes
followed
her
about
her
daily
tasks
once
only
with
mary
she
alluded
to
the
conversation
which
had
passed
between
them
was
one
day
when
they
were
together
spinning
in
the
north
upper
room
that
looked
out
upon
the
sea
it
was
a
glorious
day
a
ship
was
coming
in
under
full
sail
with
white
gleaming
wings
marvyn
watched
it
a
few
moments
gay
creature
so
full
of
exultant
life
then
smothered
down
an
inward
groan
and
mary
thought
she
heard
her
saying
thy
will
be
done
mary
she
said
gently
i
hope
you
will
forget
all
i
said
to
you
that
dreadful
day
it
had
to
be
said
or
i
should
have
died
mary
i
begin
to
think
that
it
is
not
best
to
stretch
our
minds
with
reasonings
where
we
are
so
limited
where
we
can
know
so
little
i
am
quite
sure
there
must
be
dreadful
mistakes
somewhere
it
seems
to
me
irreverent
and
shocking
that
a
child
should
oppose
a
father
or
a
creature
its
creator
i
never
should
have
done
it
only
that
where
direct
questions
are
presented
to
the
judgment
one
can
not
help
judging
if
one
is
required
to
praise
a
being
as
just
and
good
one
must
judge
of
his
actions
by
some
standard
of
right
we
have
no
standard
but
such
as
our
creator
has
placed
in
us
i
have
been
told
it
was
my
duty
to
attend
to
these
subjects
and
i
have
tried
to
the
result
has
been
that
the
facts
presented
seem
wholly
irreconcilable
with
any
notions
of
justice
or
mercy
that
i
am
able
to
form
if
these
be
the
facts
i
can
only
say
that
my
nature
is
made
entirely
opposed
to
them
if
i
followed
the
standard
of
right
they
present
and
acted
according
to
my
small
mortal
powers
on
the
same
principles
i
should
be
a
very
bad
person
any
father
who
should
make
such
use
of
power
over
his
children
as
they
say
the
deity
does
with
regard
to
us
would
be
looked
upon
as
a
monster
by
our
very
imperfect
moral
sense
yet
i
can
not
say
that
the
facts
are
not
so
when
i
heard
the
doctor
s
sermons
on
sin
a
necessary
means
of
the
greatest
good
i
could
not
extricate
myself
from
the
reasoning
i
have
thought
in
desperate
moments
of
giving
up
the
bible
itself
but
what
do
i
gain
do
i
not
see
the
same
difficulty
in
nature
i
see
everywhere
a
being
whose
main
ends
seem
to
be
beneficent
but
whose
good
purposes
are
worked
out
at
terrible
expense
of
suffering
and
apparently
by
the
total
sacrifice
of
myriads
of
sensitive
creatures
i
see
unflinching
order
general
but
no
sympathy
no
mercy
storms
earthquakes
volcanoes
sickness
death
go
on
without
regarding
us
everywhere
i
see
the
most
hopeless
unrelieved
suffering
for
aught
i
see
it
may
be
eternal
immortality
is
a
dreadful
chance
and
i
would
rather
never
have
doctor
s
dreadful
system
is
i
confess
much
like
the
laws
of
nature
about
what
one
may
reason
out
from
them
there
is
but
just
one
thing
remaining
and
that
is
as
candace
said
the
cross
of
christ
if
god
so
loved
us
he
died
for
us
love
hath
no
man
than
this
it
seems
to
me
that
love
is
shown
here
in
the
two
highest
forms
possible
to
our
comprehension
we
see
a
being
who
gives
himself
for
us
more
than
that
harder
than
that
a
being
who
consents
to
the
suffering
of
a
dearer
than
self
mary
i
feel
that
i
must
love
more
to
give
up
one
of
my
children
to
suffer
than
to
consent
to
suffer
myself
there
is
a
world
of
comfort
to
me
in
the
words
he
that
spared
not
his
own
son
but
delivered
him
up
for
us
all
how
shall
he
not
with
him
also
freely
give
us
all
things
these
words
speak
to
my
heart
i
can
interpret
them
by
my
own
nature
and
i
rest
on
them
if
there
is
a
fathomless
mystery
of
sin
and
sorrow
there
is
a
deeper
mystery
of
god
s
love
so
mary
i
try
candace
s
way
look
at
christ
pray
to
him
if
he
that
hath
seen
him
hath
seen
the
father
it
is
enough
i
rest
there
wait
what
i
know
not
now
i
shall
know
mary
kept
all
things
and
pondered
them
in
her
heart
she
could
speak
to
no
one
to
her
mother
nor
to
her
spiritual
guide
for
had
she
not
passed
to
a
region
beyond
theirs
as
well
might
those
on
the
hither
side
of
mortality
instruct
the
souls
gone
beyond
the
veil
as
souls
outside
a
great
affliction
guide
those
who
are
struggling
in
it
that
is
a
mighty
baptism
and
only
christ
can
go
down
with
us
into
those
waters
scudder
and
the
doctor
only
marked
that
she
was
more
than
ever
conscientious
in
every
duty
and
that
she
brought
to
life
s
daily
realities
something
of
the
calmness
and
disengagedness
of
one
whose
soul
has
been
wrenched
by
a
mighty
shock
from
all
moorings
here
below
hopes
did
not
excite
fears
did
not
alarm
her
life
had
no
force
strong
enough
to
awaken
a
thrill
within
and
the
only
subjects
on
which
she
ever
spoke
with
any
degree
of
ardour
were
religious
subjects
one
who
should
have
seen
moving
about
the
daily
ministrations
of
the
cottage
a
pale
girl
whose
steps
were
firm
whose
eye
was
calm
whose
hands
were
ever
busy
would
scarce
imagine
that
through
that
silent
heart
were
passing
tides
of
thought
that
measured
a
universe
but
it
was
even
so
through
that
one
gap
of
sorrow
flowed
in
the
whole
awful
mystery
of
existence
and
silently
as
she
spun
and
sewed
she
thought
over
and
over
again
all
that
she
had
ever
been
taught
and
compared
and
revolved
it
by
the
light
of
a
dawning
inward
revelation
sorrow
is
the
great
of
immortal
powers
sorrow
is
the
great
searcher
and
revealer
of
hearts
the
great
test
of
truth
for
plato
has
wisely
said
sorrow
will
not
endure
sophisms
all
shams
and
unrealities
melt
in
the
fire
of
that
awful
furnace
sorrow
reveals
forces
in
ourselves
we
never
dreamed
of
the
soul
a
bound
and
sleeping
prisoner
hears
her
knock
on
her
and
wakens
oh
how
narrow
the
walls
oh
how
close
and
dark
the
grated
window
how
the
long
useless
wings
beat
against
the
impassable
barriers
where
are
we
what
this
prison
what
beyond
oh
for
more
air
more
light
when
will
the
door
be
opened
the
soul
seems
to
itself
to
widen
and
to
deepen
it
trembles
at
its
own
dreadful
forces
it
gathers
up
in
waves
that
break
with
wailing
only
to
flow
back
into
the
everlasting
void
the
calmest
and
most
centred
natures
are
sometimes
thrown
by
the
shock
of
a
great
sorrow
into
a
tumultuous
amazement
all
things
are
changed
the
earth
no
longer
seems
solid
the
skies
no
longer
secure
a
deep
abyss
seems
underlying
every
joyous
scene
of
life
the
soul
struck
with
this
awful
inspiration
is
a
mournful
cassandra
she
sees
blood
on
every
threshold
and
shudders
in
the
midst
of
mirth
and
festival
with
the
weight
of
a
terrible
wisdom
who
shall
dare
be
glad
any
more
that
has
once
seen
the
frail
foundations
on
which
love
and
joy
are
built
our
brighter
hours
have
they
only
been
weaving
a
network
of
agonizing
remembrances
for
this
day
of
bereavement
the
heart
is
pierced
with
every
past
joy
with
every
hope
of
its
ignorant
prosperity
behind
every
scale
in
music
the
gayest
and
cheeriest
the
grandest
the
most
triumphant
lies
its
dark
relative
minor
the
notes
are
the
same
but
the
change
of
a
semitone
changes
all
to
gloom
all
our
gayest
hours
are
tunes
that
have
a
modulation
into
these
dreary
keys
ever
possible
at
any
moment
the
may
be
struck
the
firmest
natures
are
often
beside
themselves
with
astonishment
and
dismay
when
they
are
called
to
this
dread
initiation
they
thought
it
a
very
happy
world
before
glorious
universe
now
it
is
darkened
with
the
shadow
of
insoluble
mysteries
why
this
everlasting
tramp
of
inevitable
laws
on
quivering
life
if
the
wheels
must
roll
why
must
the
crushed
be
so
living
and
sensitive
and
yet
sorrow
is
sorrow
is
grand
and
great
sorrow
is
wise
and
our
own
instinctive
valuations
the
intense
sympathy
which
we
give
to
the
tragedy
which
god
has
inwoven
into
the
laws
of
nature
show
us
that
it
is
with
no
slavish
dread
no
cowardly
shrinking
that
we
should
approach
her
divine
mysteries
what
are
the
natures
that
can
not
suffer
who
values
them
from
the
fat
oyster
over
which
the
silver
tide
rises
and
falls
without
one
pulse
upon
its
fleshy
ear
to
the
hero
who
stands
with
quivering
nerve
parting
with
wife
and
child
and
home
for
country
and
god
all
the
way
up
is
an
ascending
scale
marked
by
increasing
power
to
suffer
and
when
we
look
to
the
head
of
all
being
up
through
principalities
and
powers
and
princedoms
with
dazzling
orders
and
celestial
blazonry
to
behold
by
what
emblem
the
infinite
sovereign
chooses
to
reveal
himself
we
behold
in
the
midst
of
the
throne
a
lamb
as
it
had
been
sorrow
is
divine
sorrow
is
reigning
on
the
throne
of
the
universe
and
the
crown
of
all
crowns
has
been
one
of
thorns
there
have
been
many
books
that
treat
of
the
mystery
of
sorrow
but
only
one
that
bids
us
glory
in
tribulation
and
count
it
all
joy
when
we
fall
into
divers
afflictions
that
so
we
may
be
associated
with
that
great
fellowship
of
suffering
of
which
the
incarnate
god
is
the
head
and
through
which
he
is
carrying
a
redemptive
conflict
to
a
glorious
victory
over
evil
if
we
suffer
with
him
we
shall
also
reign
with
him
even
in
the
very
making
up
of
our
physical
nature
god
puts
suggestions
of
such
a
result
weeping
may
endure
for
a
night
but
joy
cometh
in
the
there
are
victorious
powers
in
our
nature
which
are
all
the
while
working
for
us
in
our
deepest
pain
it
is
said
that
after
the
sufferings
of
the
rack
there
ensues
a
period
in
which
the
simple
repose
from
torture
produces
a
beatific
trance
it
is
the
reaction
of
nature
asserting
the
benignant
intentions
of
her
creator
so
after
great
mental
conflicts
and
agonies
must
come
a
reaction
and
the
divine
spirit
with
our
spirit
seizes
the
favourable
moment
and
interpenetrating
natural
laws
with
a
celestial
vitality
carries
up
the
soul
to
joys
beyond
the
ordinary
possibilities
of
mortality
it
is
said
that
gardeners
sometimes
when
they
would
bring
a
rose
to
richer
flowering
deprive
it
for
a
season
of
light
and
moisture
silent
and
dark
it
stands
dropping
one
fading
leaf
after
another
and
seeming
to
go
down
patiently
to
death
but
when
every
leaf
is
dropped
and
the
plant
stands
stripped
to
the
uttermost
a
new
life
is
even
then
working
in
the
buds
from
which
shall
spring
a
tender
foliage
and
a
brighter
wealth
of
flowers
so
often
in
celestial
gardening
every
leaf
of
earthly
joy
must
drop
before
a
new
and
divine
bloom
visits
the
soul
gradually
as
months
passed
away
the
floods
grew
still
the
mighty
rushes
of
the
inner
tide
ceased
to
dash
there
came
first
a
delicious
calmness
and
then
a
celestial
inner
clearness
in
which
the
soul
seemed
to
lie
quiet
as
an
untroubled
ocean
reflecting
heaven
then
came
the
fulness
of
mysterious
communion
given
to
the
pure
in
heart
that
advent
of
the
comforter
in
the
soul
teaching
all
things
and
bringing
all
things
to
remembrance
and
mary
moved
in
a
world
transfigured
by
a
celestial
radiance
her
face
so
long
mournfully
calm
like
some
chiselled
statue
of
patience
now
wore
a
radiance
as
when
one
places
a
light
behind
some
alabaster
screen
sculptured
with
mysterious
and
holy
emblems
and
words
of
strange
sweetness
broke
from
her
as
if
one
should
hear
snatches
of
music
from
a
door
suddenly
opened
in
heaven
something
wise
and
strong
and
sacred
gave
an
involuntary
impression
of
awe
in
her
looks
and
words
it
was
not
the
loveliness
of
early
days
looking
with
ignorant
eyes
on
sin
and
sorrow
but
the
victorious
sweetness
of
that
great
multitude
who
have
come
out
of
great
tribulation
having
washed
their
robes
and
made
them
white
in
the
blood
of
the
lamb
in
her
eyes
there
was
that
nameless
depth
that
one
sees
with
awe
in
the
sistine
madonna
eyes
that
have
measured
infinite
sorrow
and
looked
through
it
to
an
infinite
peace
my
dear
madam
said
the
doctor
to
scudder
i
can
not
but
think
there
must
be
some
uncommonly
gracious
exercises
passing
in
the
mind
of
your
daughter
for
i
observe
that
though
she
is
not
inclined
to
conversation
she
seems
to
be
much
in
prayer
and
i
have
of
late
felt
the
sense
of
a
divine
presence
with
her
in
a
most
unusual
degree
has
she
opened
her
mind
to
you
mary
was
always
a
silent
girl
said
scudder
and
not
given
to
speaking
of
her
own
feelings
indeed
until
she
gave
you
an
account
of
her
spiritual
state
on
joining
the
church
i
never
knew
what
her
exercises
were
hers
is
a
most
singular
case
i
never
knew
the
time
when
she
did
not
seem
to
love
god
more
than
anything
else
it
has
disturbed
me
sometimes
because
i
did
not
know
but
it
might
be
mere
natural
sensibility
instead
of
gracious
do
not
disturb
yourself
madam
said
the
doctor
the
spirit
worketh
when
where
and
how
he
will
and
undoubtedly
there
have
been
cases
where
his
operations
commence
exceedingly
early
edwards
relates
a
case
of
a
young
person
who
experienced
a
marked
conversion
when
three
years
of
age
and
jeremiah
was
called
from
the
womb
jeremiah
i
in
all
cases
we
must
test
the
quality
of
the
evidence
without
relation
to
the
time
of
its
commencement
i
do
not
generally
lay
much
stress
on
our
impressions
which
are
often
uncertain
and
delusive
yet
i
have
had
an
impression
that
the
lord
would
be
pleased
to
make
some
singular
manifestations
of
his
grace
through
this
young
person
in
the
economy
of
grace
there
is
neither
male
nor
female
and
peter
says
acts
ii
that
the
spirit
of
the
lord
shall
be
poured
out
and
your
sons
and
your
daughters
shall
prophesy
yet
if
we
consider
that
the
son
of
god
as
to
his
human
nature
was
made
of
a
woman
it
leads
us
to
see
that
in
matters
of
grace
god
sets
a
special
value
on
woman
s
nature
and
designs
to
put
special
honour
upon
it
accordingly
there
have
been
in
the
church
in
all
ages
holy
women
who
have
received
the
spirit
and
been
called
to
a
ministration
in
the
things
of
as
deborah
huldah
and
anna
the
prophetess
in
our
own
days
most
uncommon
manifestations
of
divine
grace
have
been
given
to
holy
women
it
was
my
privilege
to
be
in
the
family
of
president
edwards
at
a
time
when
northampton
was
specially
visited
and
his
wife
seemed
and
spoke
more
like
a
glorified
spirit
than
a
mortal
woman
and
multitudes
flocked
to
the
house
to
hear
her
wonderful
words
she
seemed
to
have
such
a
sense
of
the
divine
love
as
was
almost
beyond
the
powers
of
nature
to
endure
just
to
speak
the
words
our
father
who
art
in
heaven
would
overcome
her
with
such
a
manifestation
that
she
would
become
cold
and
almost
faint
and
though
she
uttered
much
yet
she
told
us
that
the
divinest
things
she
saw
could
not
be
spoken
these
things
could
not
be
fanaticism
for
she
was
a
person
of
a
singular
evenness
of
nature
and
of
great
skill
and
discretion
in
temporal
matters
and
of
an
exceeding
humility
sweetness
and
quietness
of
i
have
observed
of
late
said
scudder
that
in
our
praying
circles
mary
seemed
much
carried
out
of
herself
and
often
as
if
she
would
speak
and
with
difficulty
holding
herself
back
i
have
not
urged
her
because
i
thought
it
best
to
wait
till
she
should
feel
full
therein
you
do
rightly
madam
said
the
doctor
but
i
am
persuaded
you
will
hear
from
her
it
came
at
length
the
hour
of
utterance
and
one
day
in
a
praying
circle
of
the
women
of
the
church
all
were
startled
by
the
clear
silver
tones
of
one
who
sat
among
them
and
spoke
with
the
unconscious
simplicity
of
an
angel
child
calling
god
her
father
and
speaking
of
an
ineffable
union
in
christ
binding
all
things
together
in
one
and
making
all
complete
in
him
she
spoke
of
a
love
passing
all
love
of
lovers
or
of
love
for
ever
spending
yet
never
love
ever
pierced
and
bleeding
yet
ever
constant
and
triumphant
rejoicing
with
infinite
joy
to
bear
in
its
own
body
the
sins
and
sorrows
of
a
victorious
love
rejoicing
to
endure
panting
to
give
and
offering
its
whole
self
with
an
infinite
joyfulness
for
our
salvation
and
when
kneeling
she
poured
out
her
soul
in
prayer
her
words
seemed
so
many
winged
angels
musical
with
unearthly
harpings
of
an
untold
blessedness
they
who
heard
her
had
the
sensation
of
rising
in
the
air
of
feeling
a
celestial
light
and
warmth
descending
into
their
souls
and
when
rising
she
stood
silent
and
with
downcast
drooping
eyelids
there
were
tears
in
all
eyes
and
a
hush
in
all
movements
as
she
passed
as
if
something
celestial
were
passing
out
miss
prissy
came
rushing
homeward
to
hold
a
private
congratulatory
talk
with
the
doctor
and
scudder
while
mary
was
tranquilly
setting
the
and
cutting
bread
for
supper
to
see
her
now
certainly
said
miss
prissy
moving
round
so
thoughtful
not
forgetting
anything
and
doing
everything
so
calm
you
wouldn
t
a
thought
it
could
be
her
that
spoke
those
blessed
words
and
made
that
prayer
well
certainly
that
prayer
seemed
to
take
us
all
right
up
and
put
us
down
in
heaven
and
when
i
opened
my
eyes
and
saw
the
roses
and
on
the
i
had
to
ask
myself
where
have
i
been
oh
miss
scudder
her
afflictions
have
been
sanctified
to
her
and
really
when
i
see
her
going
on
so
i
feel
she
can
t
be
long
for
us
they
say
dying
grace
is
for
dying
hours
and
i
m
sure
this
seems
more
like
dying
grace
than
anything
that
i
ever
yet
she
is
a
precious
gift
said
the
doctor
let
us
thank
the
lord
for
his
grace
through
her
she
has
evidently
had
a
manifestation
of
the
beloved
and
feedeth
among
the
lilies
canticles
vi
and
we
will
not
question
the
lord
s
further
dispensations
concerning
certainly
said
miss
prissy
briskly
it
s
never
best
to
borrow
trouble
sufficient
unto
the
day
is
enough
to
be
sure
and
now
miss
scudder
i
thought
i
d
just
take
a
look
at
that
silk
of
yours
to
see
what
would
have
to
be
done
with
it
because
i
must
make
every
minute
tell
and
you
know
i
lose
half
a
day
every
week
for
the
though
i
ought
not
to
say
i
lose
it
either
for
i
was
telling
miss
general
wilcox
i
wouldn
t
give
up
that
meeting
for
bags
and
bags
of
gold
she
wanted
me
to
come
and
sew
for
her
one
wednesday
and
says
i
miss
wilcox
i
m
poor
and
have
to
live
by
my
work
but
i
a
n
t
so
poor
but
what
i
have
some
comforts
and
i
can
t
give
up
my
for
any
you
see
if
one
gets
a
little
lift
there
it
makes
all
the
work
go
lighter
but
then
i
have
to
be
particular
to
save
up
every
scrap
and
end
of
scudder
and
miss
prissy
crossed
the
kitchen
and
entered
the
bedroom
and
soon
had
the
silk
under
consideration
well
miss
scudder
said
miss
prissy
after
mature
investigation
here
s
a
broad
hem
not
cut
at
all
on
the
edge
as
i
see
and
that
might
be
turned
down
and
so
cut
off
the
worn
spot
up
by
the
waist
and
then
if
it
is
turned
it
will
look
every
bit
and
grain
as
well
as
a
new
silk
i
ll
sit
right
down
now
and
go
to
ripping
i
put
my
into
my
pocket
when
i
put
on
this
dress
to
go
to
because
says
i
to
myself
there
ll
be
something
to
do
at
miss
scudder
s
you
just
get
an
iron
to
the
fire
and
we
ll
have
it
all
ripped
and
pressed
out
before
miss
prissy
seated
herself
at
the
open
window
as
cheery
as
a
fresh
and
began
busily
plying
her
knife
looking
at
the
garment
she
was
ripping
with
an
astute
air
as
if
she
were
about
to
circumvent
it
into
being
a
new
dress
by
some
surprising
act
of
legerdemain
scudder
walked
to
the
and
began
changing
her
for
a
one
miss
prissy
after
a
while
commenced
in
a
mysterious
tone
miss
scudder
i
know
folks
like
me
shouldn
t
have
their
eyes
open
too
wide
but
then
i
can
t
help
noticing
some
things
did
you
see
the
doctor
s
face
when
we
was
talking
to
him
about
mary
why
he
coloured
all
up
and
the
tears
came
into
his
eyes
it
s
my
belief
that
that
blessed
man
worships
the
ground
she
treads
on
i
don
t
mean
either
cause
that
would
be
wicked
and
he
s
too
good
a
man
to
make
a
graven
image
of
anything
but
it
s
clear
to
see
that
there
a
n
t
anybody
in
the
world
like
mary
to
him
i
always
did
think
so
but
i
used
to
think
mary
was
such
a
little
she
d
do
better
you
know
i
thought
about
some
younger
laws
now
i
see
how
she
rises
up
to
be
ahead
of
everybody
and
is
so
kind
of
i
can
t
but
see
the
leadings
of
providence
what
a
minister
s
wife
she
d
be
miss
scudder
why
all
the
ladies
coming
out
of
were
speaking
of
it
you
see
they
want
the
doctor
to
get
married
it
seems
more
to
have
ministers
married
one
feels
more
free
to
open
their
exercises
of
mind
and
as
miss
deacon
twitchel
said
to
if
the
lord
had
made
a
woman
o
purpose
as
he
did
for
adam
he
wouldn
t
have
made
her
a
bit
different
from
mary
why
the
oldest
of
us
would
follow
her
lead
cause
she
goes
before
us
without
knowing
i
feel
that
the
lord
has
greatly
blessed
me
in
such
a
child
said
scudder
and
i
feel
disposed
to
wait
the
leadings
of
just
exactly
said
miss
prissy
giving
a
shake
to
her
silk
and
as
miss
twitchel
said
in
this
case
every
providence
seems
to
p
int
i
felt
dreadfully
for
her
along
six
months
back
but
now
i
see
how
she
s
been
brought
out
i
begin
to
see
that
things
are
for
the
best
perhaps
after
all
i
can
t
help
feeling
that
jim
marvyn
is
gone
to
heaven
poor
fellow
his
father
is
a
deacon
such
a
good
man
jim
though
he
did
make
a
great
laugh
wherever
he
went
and
sometimes
laughed
where
he
hadn
t
ought
to
was
a
fellow
now
to
be
sure
as
the
doctor
says
amiable
instincts
a
n
t
true
holiness
but
then
they
are
better
than
unamiable
ones
like
simeon
brown
s
i
do
think
if
that
man
is
a
christian
he
is
a
dreadful
ugly
one
he
snapped
me
short
up
about
my
change
when
he
settled
with
me
last
tuesday
and
if
i
hadn
t
felt
that
it
was
a
sinful
rising
i
should
have
told
him
i
d
never
put
foot
in
his
house
again
i
m
glad
for
my
part
he
s
gone
out
of
our
church
now
jim
marvyn
was
like
a
prince
to
poor
people
and
i
remember
once
his
mother
told
him
to
settle
with
me
and
he
gave
me
most
double
and
wouldn
t
let
me
make
change
confound
it
all
miss
prissy
says
he
i
wouldn
t
stitch
as
you
do
from
morning
to
night
for
double
that
now
i
know
we
can
t
do
anything
to
recommend
ourselves
to
the
lord
but
then
i
can
t
help
feeling
some
sorts
of
folks
must
be
by
nature
more
pleasing
to
him
than
others
david
was
a
man
after
god
s
own
heart
and
he
was
a
generous
fellow
like
jim
marvyn
though
he
did
get
carried
away
by
his
spirits
sometimes
and
do
wrong
things
and
so
i
hope
the
lord
saw
fit
to
make
jim
one
of
the
elect
we
don
t
ever
know
what
god
s
grace
has
done
for
folks
i
think
a
great
many
are
converted
when
we
know
nothing
about
it
as
miss
twitchel
told
poor
old
miss
tyrrel
who
was
mourning
about
her
son
a
dreadful
wild
boy
who
was
killed
falling
from
she
says
that
from
the
to
the
deck
was
time
enough
for
divine
grace
to
do
the
i
have
always
had
a
trembling
hope
for
poor
james
said
scudder
not
on
account
of
any
of
his
good
deeds
or
amiable
traits
because
election
is
without
foresight
of
any
good
works
i
felt
he
was
a
child
of
the
covenant
at
least
by
the
father
s
side
and
i
hope
the
lord
has
heard
his
prayer
these
are
dark
providences
the
world
is
full
of
them
and
all
we
can
do
is
to
have
faith
that
the
lord
will
bring
infinite
good
out
of
finite
evil
and
make
everything
better
than
if
the
evil
had
not
happened
that
s
what
our
good
doctor
is
always
repeating
and
we
must
try
to
rejoice
in
view
of
the
happiness
of
the
universe
without
considering
whether
we
or
our
friends
are
to
be
included
in
it
or
well
dear
me
said
miss
prissy
i
hope
if
that
is
necessary
it
will
please
the
lord
to
give
it
to
me
for
i
don
t
seem
to
find
any
power
in
me
to
get
up
to
it
but
all
s
for
the
best
at
any
rate
that
s
a
just
at
this
moment
mary
s
clear
voice
at
the
door
announced
that
tea
was
on
the
table
coming
this
very
minute
said
miss
prissy
bustling
up
and
pulling
off
her
spectacles
then
running
across
the
room
she
shut
the
door
mysteriously
and
turned
to
scudder
with
the
air
of
an
impending
secret
miss
prissy
was
subject
to
sudden
impulses
of
confidence
in
which
she
was
so
very
cautious
that
not
the
thickest
door
seemed
secure
enough
and
her
voice
dropped
to
its
lowest
key
the
most
important
and
critical
words
were
entirely
omitted
or
supplied
by
a
knowing
wink
and
a
slight
stamp
of
the
foot
in
this
mood
she
now
approached
scudder
and
holding
up
her
hand
on
the
door
side
to
prevent
consequences
if
after
all
she
should
be
betrayed
into
a
loud
word
she
said
i
thought
i
d
just
say
miss
scudder
that
in
case
mary
should
the
doctor
case
you
know
there
should
be
a
in
the
house
you
just
contrive
it
so
as
to
give
me
a
month
s
notice
so
that
i
could
give
you
a
whole
fortnight
to
fix
her
up
as
such
a
good
man
s
ought
to
be
now
i
know
how
our
blessed
doctor
is
but
bless
you
ma
am
he
s
got
eyes
i
tell
you
miss
scudder
these
men
the
best
of
em
what
s
what
though
they
don
t
much
i
saw
the
doctor
look
at
mary
that
night
i
dressed
her
for
the
i
tell
you
he
d
like
to
have
his
wife
look
pretty
well
and
he
ll
get
up
some
blessed
text
or
other
about
it
just
as
he
did
that
night
about
being
brought
unto
the
king
in
raiment
of
that
is
an
encouraging
thought
to
us
but
this
thing
was
spoken
of
after
the
meeting
miss
twitchel
and
miss
jones
were
talking
about
it
and
they
all
say
that
there
would
be
the
best
got
for
her
that
was
ever
seen
in
newport
if
it
should
happen
why
there
s
reason
in
it
she
ought
to
have
at
least
two
real
good
india
silks
that
will
stand
alone
you
ll
see
she
ll
have
em
too
you
let
me
alone
for
that
and
i
was
thinking
as
i
lay
awake
last
night
of
a
new
way
of
making
up
that
you
will
say
is
just
the
sweetest
that
ever
you
did
see
and
miss
jones
was
saying
that
she
hoped
there
wouldn
t
anything
happen
without
her
knowing
it
because
her
husband
s
sister
in
philadelphia
has
sent
her
a
new
receipt
for
cake
and
she
has
tried
it
and
it
came
out
beautifully
and
she
says
she
ll
send
some
all
the
time
that
this
stream
was
flowing
scudder
stood
with
the
properly
reserved
air
of
a
discreet
matron
who
leaves
all
such
matters
to
providence
and
is
not
supposed
unduly
to
anticipate
the
future
and
in
reply
she
warmly
pressed
miss
prissy
s
hand
and
remarked
that
no
one
could
tell
what
a
day
might
bring
forth
other
general
observations
on
the
uncertainty
of
mortal
prospects
which
form
a
becoming
shield
when
people
do
not
wish
to
say
more
exactly
what
they
are
thinking
of
chapter
xxv
nothing
is
more
striking
in
the
light
and
shadow
of
the
human
drama
than
to
compare
the
inner
life
and
thoughts
of
an
elevated
and
silent
nature
with
the
thoughts
and
plans
which
those
by
whom
they
are
surrounded
have
of
and
for
them
little
thought
mary
of
any
of
the
speculations
that
busied
the
friendly
head
of
miss
prissy
or
that
lay
in
the
provident
forecastings
of
her
prudent
mother
when
a
life
into
which
all
our
life
nerves
have
run
is
cut
suddenly
away
there
follows
after
the
first
long
bleeding
is
healed
an
internal
paralysis
of
certain
portions
of
our
nature
it
was
so
with
mary
the
thousand
fibres
that
bind
youth
and
womanhood
to
earthly
love
and
life
were
all
in
her
still
as
the
grave
and
only
the
spiritual
and
divine
part
of
her
being
was
active
her
hopes
desires
and
aspirations
were
all
such
as
she
could
have
had
in
greater
perfection
as
a
disembodied
spirit
than
as
a
mortal
woman
the
small
stake
for
self
which
she
had
invested
in
life
was
gone
henceforward
all
personal
matters
were
to
her
so
indifferent
that
she
scarce
was
conscious
of
a
wish
in
relation
to
her
own
individual
happiness
she
was
through
the
sudden
crush
of
a
great
affliction
in
that
state
of
to
which
the
mystics
brought
themselves
by
fastings
and
penances
state
not
purely
healthy
nor
realizing
the
divine
ideal
of
a
perfect
human
being
made
to
exist
in
the
relations
of
human
life
one
of
those
exceptional
conditions
which
like
the
hours
that
often
precede
dissolution
seem
to
impart
to
the
subject
of
them
a
peculiar
aptitude
for
delicate
and
refined
spiritual
impressions
we
could
not
afford
to
have
it
always
we
must
think
that
broad
gay
morning
light
when
and
robin
and
bobolink
are
singing
in
chorus
with
a
thousand
insects
and
the
waving
of
a
thousand
breezes
is
on
the
whole
the
most
in
accordance
with
the
average
wants
of
those
who
have
a
material
life
to
live
and
material
work
to
do
but
then
we
reverence
that
of
midnight
when
everything
is
still
and
sing
the
nightingales
which
can
not
be
heard
by
shine
the
mysterious
stars
so
when
all
earthly
voices
are
hushed
in
the
soul
all
earthly
lights
darkened
music
and
colour
float
in
from
a
higher
sphere
no
veiled
nun
with
her
shrouded
forehead
and
downcast
eyes
ever
moved
about
a
convent
with
a
spirit
more
utterly
divided
from
the
world
than
mary
moved
about
her
daily
employments
her
care
about
the
details
of
life
seemed
more
than
ever
minute
she
was
always
anticipating
her
mother
in
every
direction
and
striving
by
a
thousand
gentle
preveniences
to
spare
her
from
fatigue
and
care
there
was
even
a
tenderness
about
her
ministrations
as
if
the
daughter
had
changed
feelings
and
places
with
the
mother
the
doctor
too
felt
a
change
in
her
manner
towards
him
which
always
considerate
and
kind
was
now
invested
with
a
tender
thoughtfulness
and
anxious
solicitude
to
serve
which
often
brought
tears
to
his
eyes
all
the
neighbours
who
had
been
in
the
habit
of
visiting
at
the
house
received
from
her
almost
daily
in
one
little
form
or
another
some
proof
of
her
thoughtful
remembrance
she
seemed
in
particular
to
attach
herself
to
marvyn
throwing
her
cares
around
that
fragile
and
wounded
nature
as
a
generous
vine
will
sometimes
embrace
with
tender
leaves
and
flowers
a
dying
tree
but
her
heart
seemed
to
have
yearnings
beyond
even
the
circle
of
home
and
friends
she
longed
for
the
sorrowful
and
the
afflicted
she
would
go
down
to
the
forgotten
and
the
oppressed
and
made
herself
the
companion
of
the
doctor
s
secret
walks
and
explorings
among
the
poor
victims
of
the
and
entered
with
zeal
as
teacher
among
his
african
catechumens
nothing
but
the
limits
of
bodily
strength
could
check
her
zeal
to
do
and
suffer
for
others
river
of
love
had
suddenly
been
checked
in
her
heart
and
it
needed
all
these
channels
to
drain
off
the
waters
that
otherwise
must
have
drowned
her
in
the
suffocating
agonies
of
repression
sometimes
indeed
there
would
be
a
returning
thrill
of
the
old
wound
one
of
those
overpowering
moments
when
some
turn
in
life
brings
back
anew
a
great
anguish
she
would
find
unexpectedly
in
a
book
a
mark
that
he
had
placed
there
or
a
turn
in
conversation
would
bring
back
a
tone
of
his
voice
or
she
would
see
on
some
thoughtless
young
head
curls
just
like
those
which
were
swaying
to
and
fro
down
among
the
wavering
seaweeds
and
then
her
heart
gave
one
great
throb
of
pain
and
turned
for
relief
to
some
immediate
act
of
love
to
some
living
being
they
who
saw
her
in
one
of
these
moments
felt
a
surging
of
her
heart
towards
them
a
moisture
of
the
eye
a
sense
of
some
inexpressible
yearning
and
knew
not
from
what
pain
that
love
was
wrung
and
what
poor
heart
was
seeking
to
still
its
own
throbbings
in
blessing
them
by
what
name
shall
we
call
this
beautiful
twilight
this
night
of
the
soul
so
starry
with
heavenly
mysteries
happiness
but
blessedness
they
who
have
it
walk
among
men
as
sorrowful
yet
always
rejoicing
as
poor
yet
making
many
rich
as
having
nothing
and
yet
possessing
all
things
the
doctor
as
we
have
seen
had
always
that
reverential
spirit
towards
women
which
accompanies
a
healthy
and
great
nature
but
in
the
constant
converse
which
he
now
held
with
a
beautiful
being
from
whom
every
particle
of
selfish
feeling
or
mortal
weakness
seemed
sublimed
he
appeared
to
yield
his
soul
up
to
her
leading
with
a
wondering
humility
as
to
some
fair
miraculous
messenger
of
heaven
all
questions
of
internal
experience
all
delicate
shadings
of
the
spiritual
history
with
which
his
pastoral
communings
in
his
flock
made
him
conversant
he
brought
to
her
to
be
resolved
with
the
purest
simplicity
of
trust
she
is
one
of
the
lord
s
rarities
he
said
one
day
to
scudder
and
i
find
it
difficult
to
maintain
the
bonds
of
christian
faithfulness
in
talking
with
her
it
is
a
charm
of
the
lord
s
hidden
ones
that
they
know
not
their
own
beauty
and
god
forbid
that
i
should
tempt
a
creature
made
so
perfect
by
divine
grace
to
or
lay
my
hand
unadvisedly
as
uzzah
did
upon
the
ark
of
god
by
my
inconsiderate
well
doctor
said
miss
prissy
who
sat
in
the
corner
sewing
on
the
silk
i
do
wish
you
could
come
into
one
of
our
meetings
and
hear
those
blessed
prayers
i
don
t
think
you
nor
anybody
else
ever
heard
anything
like
i
would
indeed
that
i
might
with
propriety
enjoy
the
privilege
said
the
doctor
well
i
ll
tell
you
what
said
miss
prissy
next
week
they
re
going
to
meet
here
and
i
ll
leave
the
door
just
ajar
and
you
can
hear
every
word
just
by
standing
in
the
thank
you
madam
said
the
doctor
it
would
certainly
be
a
blessed
privilege
but
i
can
not
persuade
myself
that
such
an
act
would
be
consistent
with
christian
ah
now
do
hear
that
good
man
said
miss
prissy
after
he
had
left
the
room
if
he
ha
n
t
got
the
making
of
a
real
gentleman
in
him
as
well
as
a
real
christian
though
i
always
did
say
for
my
part
that
a
real
christian
will
be
a
gentleman
but
i
don
t
believe
all
the
temptations
in
the
world
could
stir
that
blessed
man
one
jot
or
grain
to
do
the
least
thing
that
he
thinks
is
wrong
or
out
of
the
way
well
i
must
say
i
never
saw
such
a
good
man
he
is
the
only
man
i
ever
saw
good
enough
for
our
another
spring
came
round
and
brought
its
roses
and
the
blossomed
for
the
third
time
since
the
commencement
of
our
story
and
the
robins
had
repaired
the
old
nest
and
began
to
lay
their
blue
eggs
in
it
and
mary
still
walked
her
calm
course
as
a
sanctified
priestess
of
the
great
worship
of
sorrow
many
were
the
hearts
now
dependent
on
her
the
spiritual
histories
the
thread
of
which
were
held
in
her
loving
hand
the
souls
burdened
with
sins
or
oppressed
with
sorrow
who
found
in
her
bosom
at
once
confessional
and
sanctuary
so
many
sought
her
prayers
that
her
hours
of
intercession
were
full
and
needed
to
be
lengthened
often
to
embrace
all
for
whom
she
would
plead
united
to
the
good
doctor
by
a
constant
friendship
and
fellowship
she
had
gradually
grown
accustomed
to
the
more
and
more
intimate
manner
in
which
he
regarded
her
which
had
risen
from
a
simple
dear
child
and
dear
mary
to
dear
friend
and
at
last
dearest
of
all
friends
which
he
frequently
called
her
and
encouraged
by
the
calm
confiding
sweetness
of
those
still
blue
eyes
and
that
gentle
smile
which
came
without
one
varying
flutter
of
the
pulse
or
the
rising
of
the
slightest
flush
on
the
marble
cheek
one
day
a
letter
was
brought
in
it
was
from
madame
de
frontignac
it
was
in
french
and
ran
as
follows
my
dear
little
white
rose
i
am
longing
to
see
you
once
more
and
before
long
i
shall
be
in
newport
dear
little
mary
i
am
sad
very
sad
the
days
seem
all
of
them
too
long
and
every
morning
i
look
out
of
my
window
and
wonder
why
i
was
born
i
am
not
so
happy
as
i
used
to
be
when
i
cared
for
nothing
but
to
sing
and
smooth
my
feathers
like
the
birds
that
is
the
best
kind
of
life
for
us
women
if
we
love
anything
better
than
our
clothes
it
is
sure
to
bring
us
great
sorrow
for
all
that
i
can
t
help
thinking
it
is
very
noble
and
beautiful
to
love
is
very
beautiful
but
very
very
sad
my
poor
dear
little
white
cat
i
should
like
to
hold
you
a
little
while
to
my
heart
is
so
cold
all
the
time
and
aches
so
i
wish
i
were
dead
but
then
i
am
not
good
enough
to
die
the
abbé
says
we
must
offer
up
our
sorrow
to
god
as
a
satisfaction
for
our
sins
i
have
a
good
deal
to
offer
because
my
nature
is
strong
and
i
can
feel
a
great
deal
but
i
am
very
selfish
dear
little
mary
to
think
only
of
myself
when
i
know
how
you
must
suffer
ah
but
you
knew
he
loved
you
truly
the
poor
dear
boy
that
is
something
i
pray
daily
for
his
soul
don
t
think
it
wrong
of
me
you
know
it
is
our
religion
we
should
all
do
our
best
for
each
other
remember
me
tenderly
to
marvyn
poor
mother
the
bleeding
heart
of
the
mother
of
god
alone
can
understand
such
sorrows
i
am
coming
in
a
week
or
two
and
then
i
have
many
things
to
say
to
belle
rose
till
then
i
kiss
her
little
hands
verginie
de
one
beautiful
afternoon
not
long
after
a
carriage
stopped
at
the
cottage
and
madame
de
frontignac
alighted
mary
was
spinning
in
her
garret
boudoir
and
scudder
was
at
that
moment
at
a
little
distance
from
the
house
sprinkling
some
linen
which
was
laid
out
to
bleach
on
the
green
turf
of
the
clothes
yard
madame
de
frontignac
sent
away
the
carriage
and
ran
up
the
stairway
pursuing
the
sound
of
mary
s
spinning
wheel
mingled
with
her
song
and
in
a
moment
throwing
aside
the
curtain
she
seized
mary
in
her
arms
and
kissed
her
on
either
cheek
laughing
and
crying
both
at
once
i
knew
where
i
should
find
you
i
heard
the
wheel
of
my
poor
little
princess
it
s
a
good
while
since
we
spun
together
ah
mary
darling
little
do
we
know
what
we
spin
life
is
hard
and
bitter
isn
t
it
ah
how
white
your
cheeks
are
poor
child
madame
de
frontignac
spoke
with
tears
in
her
own
eyes
passing
her
hand
caressingly
over
the
fair
cheeks
and
you
have
grown
pale
too
dear
madame
said
mary
looking
up
and
struck
with
the
change
in
the
once
brilliant
face
have
i
i
don
t
know
why
not
we
women
have
secret
places
where
our
life
runs
out
at
home
i
wear
that
makes
all
right
but
i
don
t
put
it
on
for
you
mary
you
see
me
just
as
i
mary
could
not
but
notice
the
want
of
that
brilliant
colour
and
roundness
in
the
cheek
that
made
so
glowing
a
picture
the
eyes
seemed
larger
and
tremulous
with
a
pathetic
depth
and
around
them
those
bluish
circles
that
speak
of
languor
and
pain
yet
still
changed
as
she
was
madame
de
frontignac
seemed
only
more
strikingly
interesting
and
fascinating
than
ever
still
she
had
those
thousand
pretty
movements
those
nameless
graces
of
manner
those
wavering
shades
of
expression
that
irresistibly
enchained
the
eye
and
the
imagination
true
frenchwoman
as
she
was
always
in
one
rainbow
shimmer
of
fancy
and
feeling

and

arms

little
heart

mary
i
do

now
christ
has
given
me
the
victory
over
there
was
something
sadly
sublime
in
the
manner
in
which
this
was
said
and
something
so
sacred
in
the
expression
of
mary
s
face
that
madame
de
frontignac
crossed
herself
as
she
had
been
wont
before
a
shrine
and
then
said
sweet
mary
pray
for
me
i
am
not
at
peace
i
can
not
get
the
victory
over
what
sorrow
can
you

said
mary

so
beautiful
so
rich
so
admired
whom
everybody
must
that
is
what
i
came
to
tell
you
i
came
to
confess
to
you
but
you
must
sit
down
she
said
placing
mary
on
a
low
seat
in
the
garret
window
and
verginie
will
sit
here
she
said
drawing
a
bundle
of
uncarded
wool
towards
her
and
sitting
down
at
mary
s
feet
dear
madame
said
mary
let
me
get
you
a
better
no
no
this
is
best
i
want
to
lay
my
head
in
your
lap
and
she
took
off
her
with
its
streaming
plume
and
tossed
it
carelessly
from
her
and
laid
her
head
down
on
mary
s
lap
now
don
t
call
me
madame
any
more
do
you
know
she
said
raising
her
head
with
a
sudden
brightening
of
cheek
and
eye
do
you
know
that
there
are
two
to
this
person
is
verginie
and
the
other
is
madame
de
frontignac
everybody
in
philadelphia
knows
madame
de
frontignac
she
is
very
gay
very
careless
very
happy
she
never
has
any
serious
hours
or
any
sad
thoughts
she
wears
powder
and
diamonds
and
dances
all
night
and
never
is
madame
but
verginie
is
quite
another
thing
she
is
tired
of
all
this
tired
of
the
balls
and
the
dancing
and
the
diamonds
and
the
beaux
and
she
likes
true
people
and
would
like
to
live
very
quiet
with
somebody
that
she
loved
she
is
very
unhappy
and
she
prays
too
sometimes
in
a
poor
little
way
like
the
birds
in
your
nest
out
there
who
don
t
know
much
but
chipper
and
cry
because
they
are
is
your
never
comes
here
never
call
me
dear
verginie
said
mary
how
i
love
you
do
you
you
are
my
good
angel
i
felt
a
good
impulse
from
you
when
i
first
saw
you
and
have
always
been
stronger
to
do
right
when
i
got
one
of
your
pretty
little
letters
oh
mary
darling
i
have
been
very
foolish
and
very
miserable
and
sometimes
tempted
to
be
very
very
bad
oh
sometimes
i
thought
i
would
not
care
for
god
or
anything
was
very
bad
of
i
was
like
a
foolish
little
fly
caught
in
a
spider
s
net
before
he
knows
mary
s
eyes
questioned
her
companion
with
an
expression
of
eager
sympathy
somewhat
blended
with
curiosity
i
can
t
make
you
understand
me
quite
said
madame
de
frontignac
unless
i
go
back
a
good
many
years
you
see
dear
mary
my
dear
angel
mamma
died
when
i
was
very
little
and
i
was
sent
to
be
educated
at
the
sacré
cœur
in
paris
i
was
very
happy
and
very
good
in
those
sisters
loved
me
and
i
loved
them
and
i
used
to
be
so
pious
and
loved
god
dearly
when
i
took
my
first
communion
sister
agatha
prepared
me
she
was
a
true
saint
and
is
in
heaven
now
and
i
remember
when
i
came
to
her
all
dressed
like
a
bride
with
my
white
crown
and
white
veil
that
she
looked
at
me
so
sadly
and
said
she
hoped
i
would
never
love
anybody
better
than
god
and
then
i
should
be
happy
i
didn
t
think
much
of
those
words
then
but
oh
i
have
since
many
times
they
used
to
tell
me
always
that
i
had
a
husband
who
was
away
in
the
army
and
who
would
come
to
marry
me
when
i
was
seventeen
and
that
he
would
give
me
all
sorts
of
beautiful
things
and
show
me
everything
i
wanted
to
see
in
the
world
and
that
i
must
love
and
honour
him
well
i
was
married
at
last
and
monsieur
de
frontignac
is
a
good
brave
man
although
he
seemed
to
me
very
old
and
sober
but
he
was
always
kind
to
me
and
gave
me
nobody
knows
how
many
sets
of
jewelry
and
let
me
do
everything
i
wanted
to
and
so
i
liked
him
very
much
but
i
thought
there
was
no
danger
i
should
love
him
or
anybody
else
better
than
god
i
didn
t
anybody
in
those
days
i
only
liked
people
and
some
people
more
than
others
all
the
men
i
saw
professed
to
be
lovers
and
i
liked
to
lead
them
about
and
see
what
foolish
things
i
could
make
them
do
because
it
pleased
my
vanity
but
i
laughed
at
the
very
idea
of
love
well
mary
when
we
came
to
philadelphia
i
heard
everybody
speaking
of
colonel
what
a
fascinating
man
he
was
and
i
thought
it
would
be
a
pretty
thing
to
have
him
in
my
so
i
did
all
i
could
to
charm
him
i
tried
all
my
little
if
it
is
a
sin
for
us
women
to
do
such
things
i
am
sure
i
have
been
punished
for
it
mary
he
was
stronger
than
i
was
these
men
they
are
not
satisfied
with
having
the
whole
earth
under
their
feet
and
having
all
the
strength
and
all
the
glory
but
they
must
even
take
away
our
poor
little
s
too
bad
i
can
t
tell
you
how
it
was
i
didn
t
know
myself
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
took
my
very
life
away
from
me
and
it
was
all
done
before
i
knew
it
he
called
himself
my
offered
to
teach
me
read
with
me
and
he
controlled
my
whole
life
i
that
used
to
be
so
haughty
so
that
used
to
laugh
to
think
how
independent
i
was
of
everybody
i
was
entirely
under
his
control
though
i
tried
not
to
show
it
i
didn
t
well
know
where
i
was
for
he
talked
friendship
and
i
talked
friendship
he
talked
about
sympathetic
natures
that
are
made
for
each
other
and
i
thought
how
beautiful
it
all
was
it
was
living
in
a
new
world
monsieur
de
frontignac
was
as
much
charmed
with
him
as
i
was
he
often
told
me
that
he
was
his
best
friend
that
he
was
his
model
man
and
i
thought
oh
mary
you
would
wonder
to
hear
me
say
what
i
thought
i
thought
he
was
a
bayard
a
sully
a
montmorenci
everything
grand
and
noble
and
good
i
loved
him
with
a
religion
i
would
have
died
for
him
i
sometimes
thought
how
i
might
lay
down
my
life
to
save
his
like
women
i
read
of
in
history
i
did
not
know
myself
i
was
astonished
i
could
feel
so
and
i
did
not
dream
that
this
could
be
wrong
how
could
i
when
it
made
me
feel
more
religious
than
anything
in
my
whole
life
everything
in
the
world
seemed
to
grow
sacred
i
thought
if
men
could
be
so
good
and
admirable
life
was
a
holy
thing
and
not
to
be
trifled
with
but
our
good
abbé
is
a
faithful
shepherd
and
when
i
told
him
these
things
in
confession
he
told
me
i
was
in
great
of
falling
into
mortal
sin
oh
mary
it
was
as
if
the
earth
opened
under
me
he
told
me
too
that
this
noble
man
this
man
so
dear
was
a
heretic
and
that
if
he
died
he
would
go
to
dreadful
pains
oh
mary
i
dare
not
tell
you
half
what
he
told
me
dreadful
things
that
make
me
shiver
when
i
think
of
them
and
then
he
said
that
i
must
offer
myself
a
sacrifice
for
him
that
if
i
would
put
down
all
this
love
and
overcome
it
that
god
would
perhaps
accept
it
as
a
satisfaction
and
bring
him
into
the
true
church
at
last
then
i
began
to
try
oh
mary
we
never
know
how
we
love
till
we
try
to
unlove
it
seemed
like
taking
my
heart
out
of
my
breast
and
separating
life
from
life
how
can
one
do
it
i
wish
any
one
would
tell
me
the
abbé
said
i
must
do
it
by
prayer
but
it
seemed
to
me
prayer
only
made
me
think
the
more
of
him
but
at
last
i
had
a
great
shock
everything
broke
up
like
a
great
grand
noble
dream
and
i
waked
out
of
it
just
as
weak
and
wretched
as
one
feels
when
one
has
overslept
oh
mary
i
found
i
was
mistaken
in
all
wholly
madame
de
frontignac
laid
her
forehead
on
mary
s
knee
and
her
long
chestnut
hair
drooped
down
over
her
face
he
was
going
somewhere
with
my
husband
to
explore
out
in
the
regions
of
the
ohio
where
he
had
some
splendid
schemes
of
founding
a
state
and
i
was
all
interest
and
one
day
as
they
were
preparing
monsieur
de
frontignac
gave
me
a
quantity
of
papers
to
read
and
arrange
and
among
them
was
a
part
of
a
letter
i
never
could
imagine
how
it
got
there
it
was
to
one
of
his
confidential
friends
i
read
it
at
first
wondering
what
it
meant
till
i
came
to
two
or
three
sentences
about
madame
de
frontignac
paused
a
moment
and
then
said
rising
with
sudden
energy
mary
that
man
never
loved
me
he
can
not
love
he
does
not
know
what
love
is
what
i
felt
he
can
not
know
he
can
not
even
dream
of
it
because
he
never
felt
anything
like
it
such
men
never
know
us
women
we
are
as
high
as
heaven
above
them
it
is
true
enough
that
my
heart
was
wholly
in
his
power
but
why
because
i
adored
him
as
something
divine
incapable
of
dishonour
incapable
of
selfishness
incapable
of
even
a
thought
that
was
not
perfectly
noble
and
heroic
if
he
had
been
all
that
i
would
have
been
proud
to
have
been
even
a
poor
little
flower
that
should
exhale
away
to
give
him
an
hour
s
pleasure
i
would
have
offered
my
whole
life
to
god
as
a
sacrifice
for
such
a
glorious
soul
and
all
this
time
what
was
he
thinking
of
me
he
was
my
feelings
to
carry
his
plans
he
was
admiring
me
like
a
picture
he
was
considering
what
he
should
do
with
me
and
were
it
not
for
his
interests
with
my
husband
would
have
tried
his
power
to
make
me
sacrifice
this
world
and
the
next
to
his
pleasure
but
he
does
not
know
me
my
mother
was
a
montmorenci
and
i
have
the
blood
of
her
house
in
my
veins
we
are
princesses
we
can
give
all
but
he
must
be
a
god
that
we
give
it
mary
s
enchanted
eye
followed
the
beautiful
narrator
as
she
enacted
before
her
this
poetry
and
tragedy
of
real
life
so
much
beyond
what
dramatic
art
can
ever
furnish
her
eyes
grew
splendid
in
their
depths
and
brilliancy
sometimes
they
were
full
of
tears
and
sometimes
they
flashed
out
like
lightnings
her
whole
form
seemed
to
be
a
plastic
vehicle
which
translated
every
emotion
of
her
soul
and
mary
sat
and
looked
at
her
with
the
intense
absorption
that
one
gives
to
the
highest
and
deepest
in
art
or
nature
faire
she
said
at
last
suddenly
stopping
and
drooping
in
every
limb
mary
i
have
lived
on
this
dream
so
thought
of
anything
all
is
gone
and
what
shall
i
do
i
think
she
added
pointing
to
the
nest
in
the
tree
mary
i
see
my
life
in
many
things
my
heart
was
once
still
and
quiet
like
the
round
little
eggs
that
were
in
your
nest
it
has
broken
out
of
its
shell
and
cries
with
cold
and
hunger
i
want
my
dream
again
wish
it
all
back
that
my
heart
could
go
back
into
its
shell
if
i
only
could
drop
this
year
out
of
my
life
and
care
for
nothing
as
i
used
to
have
tried
to
do
can
can
not
get
back
where
i
was
you
do
it
dear
verginie
said
mary
would
you
if
you
could
it
was
very
noble
and
sweet
all
that
said
verginie
it
gave
me
higher
thoughts
than
ever
i
had
before
i
think
my
feelings
were
beautiful
now
they
are
like
little
birds
that
have
no
kill
me
with
their
dear
verginie
there
is
a
real
friend
in
heaven
who
is
all
you
can
ask
or
think
better
purer
who
can
not
change
and
can
not
die
and
who
loved
you
and
gave
himself
for
you
mean
jesus
said
verginie
ah
i
know
it
and
i
say
the
offices
to
him
daily
but
my
heart
is
very
wild
and
starts
away
from
my
words
i
say
my
god
i
give
myself
to
you
after
all
i
don
t
give
myself
and
i
don
t
feel
comforted
dear
mary
you
must
have
suffered
you
loved
saw
it
we
feel
a
thing
ourselves
we
can
see
very
quick
the
same
in
others
it
was
a
dreadful
blow
to
come
so
all
at
yes
it
was
said
mary
i
thought
i
must
die
but
christ
has
given
me
these
words
were
spoken
with
that
sigh
with
which
we
always
speak
of
peace
sigh
that
told
of
storms
and
sorrows
past
sighing
of
the
wave
that
falls
spent
and
broken
on
the
shores
of
eternal
rest
there
was
a
little
pause
in
the
conversation
and
then
verginie
raised
her
head
and
spoke
in
a
sprightlier
tone
well
my
little
fairy
cat
white
doe
have
come
to
you
poor
verginie
wants
something
to
hold
to
her
heart
let
me
have
you
she
said
throwing
her
arms
round
mary
dear
dear
verginie
indeed
you
shall
said
mary
i
will
love
you
dearly
and
pray
for
you
i
always
have
prayed
for
you
ever
since
the
first
day
i
knew
i
knew
it
felt
your
prayers
in
my
heart
mary
i
have
many
thoughts
that
i
dare
not
tell
to
any
one
lately
i
can
not
help
feeling
that
some
are
real
christians
who
are
not
in
the
true
church
you
are
as
true
a
saint
as
saint
catharine
indeed
i
always
think
of
you
when
i
think
of
our
dear
lady
and
yet
they
say
there
is
no
salvation
out
of
the
this
was
a
new
view
of
the
subject
to
mary
who
had
grown
up
with
the
familiar
idea
that
the
romish
church
was
babylon
and
and
who
had
during
the
conversation
been
revolving
the
same
surmises
with
regard
to
her
friend
she
turned
her
grave
blue
eyes
on
madame
de
frontignac
with
a
somewhat
surprised
look
which
melted
into
a
but
the
latter
still
went
on
with
a
puzzled
air
as
if
trying
to
talk
herself
out
of
some
mental
perplexity
now
burr
is
a
heretic
more
than
that
he
is
an
infidel
has
no
religion
in
his
heart
i
saw
that
often
made
me
tremble
for
him
it
ought
to
have
put
me
on
my
guard
you
dear
mary
you
love
jesus
as
your
life
i
think
you
love
him
just
as
much
as
sister
agatha
who
was
a
saint
the
abbé
says
that
there
is
nothing
so
dangerous
as
to
begin
to
use
our
reason
in
religion
if
we
once
begin
we
never
know
where
it
may
carry
us
but
i
can
t
help
using
mine
a
very
little
i
must
think
there
are
some
saints
that
are
not
in
the
true
all
are
one
who
love
christ
said
mary
we
are
one
in
i
should
not
dare
to
tell
the
abbé
said
madame
de
frontignac
and
mary
queried
in
her
heart
whether
hopkins
would
feel
satisfied
that
she
could
bring
this
wanderer
to
the
fold
of
christ
without
undertaking
to
batter
down
the
walls
of
her
creed
and
yet
there
they
were
the
catholic
and
the
puritan
each
strong
in
her
respective
faith
yet
melting
together
in
that
embrace
of
love
and
sorrow
joined
in
the
great
communion
of
suffering
mary
took
up
her
testament
and
read
the
fourteenth
of
john
let
not
your
heart
be
troubled
ye
believe
in
god
believe
also
in
me
in
my
father
s
house
are
many
mansions
if
it
were
not
so
i
would
have
told
you
i
go
to
prepare
a
place
for
you
and
if
i
go
to
prepare
a
place
for
you
i
will
come
again
and
receive
you
unto
myself
that
where
i
am
there
you
may
be
mary
read
on
through
the
chapter
through
the
next
wonderful
prayer
her
face
grew
solemnly
transparent
as
of
an
angel
for
her
soul
was
lifted
from
earth
by
the
words
and
walked
with
christ
far
above
all
things
over
that
starry
pavement
where
each
footstep
is
on
a
world
the
greatest
moral
effects
are
like
those
of
music
not
wrought
out
by
intellectual
propositions
but
melted
in
by
a
divine
fusion
by
words
that
have
mysterious
indefinite
fulness
of
meaning
made
living
by
sweet
voices
which
seem
to
be
the
of
angelic
hearts
so
one
verse
in
the
bible
read
by
a
mother
in
some
hour
of
tender
prayer
has
a
significance
deeper
and
higher
than
the
most
elaborate
of
sermons
the
most
acute
of
arguments
verginie
frontignac
sat
as
one
divinely
enchanted
while
that
sweet
voice
read
on
and
when
the
silence
fell
between
them
she
gave
a
long
sigh
as
we
do
when
sweet
music
stops
they
heard
between
them
the
soft
stir
of
summer
leaves
the
distant
songs
of
birds
the
breezy
hum
when
some
afternoon
wind
shivered
through
many
branches
and
the
silver
sea
chimed
in
verginie
rose
at
last
and
kissed
mary
on
the
forehead
that
is
a
beautiful
book
she
said
and
to
read
it
all
by
one
s
self
must
be
lovely
i
can
not
understand
why
it
should
be
dangerous
it
has
not
injured
you
sweet
saint
she
added
let
me
stay
with
you
you
shall
read
to
me
every
day
do
you
know
i
came
here
to
get
you
to
take
me
i
want
you
to
show
me
how
to
find
peace
where
you
do
will
you
let
me
be
your
sister
yes
indeed
said
mary
with
a
cheek
brighter
than
it
had
been
for
many
a
day
her
heart
feeling
a
throb
of
more
real
human
pleasure
than
for
long
months
will
you
get
your
mamma
to
let
me
stay
said
verginie
with
the
bashfulness
of
a
child
haven
t
you
a
little
place
like
yours
with
white
curtains
and
sanded
floor
to
give
to
poor
little
verginie
to
learn
to
be
good
in
why
do
you
really
want
to
stay
here
with
us
said
mary
in
this
little
house
do
i
really
said
virginie
mimicking
her
voice
with
a
start
of
her
old
playfulness
i
really
come
now
coax
the
good
mamma
for
me
tell
her
i
shall
try
to
be
very
good
i
shall
help
you
with
the
spinning
you
know
i
spin
beautifully
i
shall
make
butter
and
milk
the
cow
and
set
the
tables
oh
i
will
be
so
useful
you
can
t
spare
me
i
should
love
to
have
you
dearly
said
mary
warmly
but
you
would
soon
be
dull
for
want
of
society
idée
ma
petite
said
the
lady
who
with
the
mobility
of
her
nation
had
already
recovered
some
of
the
saucy
mocking
grace
that
was
habitual
to
her
as
she
began
teasing
mary
with
a
thousand
little
childish
motions
indeed
you
must
keep
me
hid
up
here
or
may
be
the
wolf
will
find
me
and
eat
me
up
who
knows
mary
looked
at
her
with
inquiring
eyes
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
mary
mean
that
when
comes
back
to
philadelphia
he
thinks
he
will
find
me
there
he
thought
i
should
stay
while
my
husband
was
gone
and
when
he
finds
i
am
gone
he
may
come
to
newport
and
i
never
want
to
see
him
again
without
you
you
must
let
me
stay
with
have
you
told
him
said
mary
what
you
think
i
wrote
to
him
mary
but
oh
i
can
t
trust
my
heart
i
want
so
much
to
believe
him
it
kills
me
so
to
think
evil
of
him
that
it
will
never
do
for
me
to
see
him
if
he
looks
at
me
with
those
eyes
of
his
i
am
all
gone
i
shall
believe
anything
he
tells
me
he
will
draw
me
to
him
as
a
great
magnet
draws
a
poor
little
grain
of
but
now
you
know
his
unworthiness
his
baseness
said
mary
i
should
think
it
would
break
all
his
you
think
so
ah
mary
we
can
not
unlove
in
a
minute
love
is
a
great
while
dying
i
do
not
worship
him
now
as
i
did
i
know
what
he
is
i
know
he
is
bad
and
i
am
sorry
for
it
i
would
like
to
cover
it
from
all
the
world
even
from
you
mary
since
i
see
it
makes
you
dislike
him
it
hurts
me
to
hear
any
one
else
blame
him
but
sometimes
i
do
so
long
to
think
i
am
mistaken
that
i
know
if
i
should
see
him
i
should
catch
at
anything
he
might
tell
me
as
a
drowning
man
at
straws
i
should
shut
my
eyes
and
think
after
all
that
it
was
all
my
fault
and
ask
a
thousand
pardons
for
all
the
evil
he
has
done
no
mary
you
must
keep
your
blue
eyes
upon
me
or
i
shall
be
at
this
moment
scudder
s
voice
was
heard
calling
mary
below
go
down
now
darling
and
tell
mamma
make
a
good
little
talk
to
her
ah
you
are
queen
here
all
do
as
you
say
even
the
good
priest
there
you
have
a
little
hand
but
it
leads
all
so
go
scudder
was
somewhat
flurried
and
discomposed
at
the
proposition
there
were
the
and
the
in
her
nature
such
as
we
all
have
in
the
first
place
madame
de
frontignac
belonged
to
high
society
and
that
was
for
scudder
prayed
daily
against
worldly
vanities
because
she
felt
a
little
traitor
in
her
heart
that
was
ready
to
open
its
door
to
them
if
not
constantly
talked
down
in
the
second
place
madame
de
frontignac
was
french
there
was
a
for
scudder
had
enough
of
her
father
john
bull
in
her
heart
to
have
a
very
wary
on
anything
french
but
then
in
the
third
place
she
was
out
of
health
and
unhappy
and
there
was
a
again
for
scudder
was
as
kind
and
motherly
a
soul
as
ever
breathed
but
then
she
was
a
catholic
but
the
doctor
and
mary
might
convert
her
and
then
mary
wanted
her
and
she
was
a
pretty
bewitching
loveable
creature
the
had
it
and
it
was
agreed
that
madame
de
frontignac
should
be
installed
as
proprietress
of
the
spare
chamber
and
she
sat
down
to
the
that
evening
in
the
great
kitchen
chapter
xxvi
the
domesticating
of
madame
de
frontignac
as
an
inmate
of
the
cottage
added
a
new
element
of
vivacity
to
that
still
and
unvaried
life
one
of
the
most
beautiful
traits
of
french
nature
is
that
fine
gift
of
appreciation
which
seizes
at
once
the
picturesque
side
of
every
condition
of
life
and
finds
in
its
own
varied
storehouse
something
to
assort
with
it
as
compared
with
the
the
french
appear
to
be
gifted
with
a
childhood
of
nature
and
to
have
the
power
that
children
have
of
gilding
every
scene
of
life
with
some
of
their
own
poetic
fancies
madame
de
frontignac
was
in
raptures
with
the
sanded
floor
of
her
little
room
which
commanded
through
the
a
little
morsel
of
a
she
could
fancy
it
was
a
nymph
s
cave
she
said
yes
marie
i
will
play
calypso
and
you
shall
play
telemachus
and
hopkins
shall
be
mentor
mentor
was
so
very
very
good
only
a
little
she
said
pronouncing
the
last
word
with
a
wicked
accent
and
lifting
her
hands
with
a
whimsical
gesture
like
a
naughty
child
who
expects
a
correction
mary
could
not
but
laugh
and
as
she
laughed
more
colour
rose
in
her
waxen
cheeks
than
for
many
days
before
madame
de
frontignac
looked
triumphant
as
a
child
who
has
made
its
mother
laugh
and
went
on
laying
things
out
of
her
trunk
into
her
drawers
with
a
zeal
that
was
quite
amusing
to
see
you
see
i
have
left
all
clothes
at
philadelphia
and
brought
only
those
that
belong
to
verginie
no
feathers
no
gauzes
no
diamonds
only
white
dresses
and
my
straw
hat
i
brought
one
string
of
pearls
that
was
my
mother
s
but
pearls
you
know
belong
to
the
i
will
trim
my
hat
with
and
buttercups
together
and
we
will
go
out
on
the
beach
and
get
some
gold
and
silver
shells
to
dress
oh
i
have
ever
so
many
now
said
mary
running
into
her
room
and
coming
back
with
a
little
bag
they
both
sat
on
the
bed
together
and
began
pouring
them
out
madame
de
frontignac
showering
childish
exclamations
of
delight
suddenly
mary
put
her
hand
to
her
heart
as
if
she
had
been
struck
with
something
and
madame
de
frontignac
heard
her
say
in
a
low
voice
of
sudden
pain
oh
dear
what
is
it
mimi
she
said
looking
up
quickly
nothing
said
mary
turning
her
head
madame
de
frontignac
looked
down
and
saw
among
the
a
necklace
of
venetian
shells
that
she
knew
never
grew
on
the
shores
of
newport
she
held
it
up
ah
i
see
she
said
he
gave
you
this
ah
she
said
clasping
mary
in
her
arms
thy
sorrow
meets
thee
everywhere
may
i
be
a
comfort
to
thee
just
a
little
dear
dear
friend
said
mary
weeping
i
know
not
how
it
is
sometimes
i
think
this
sorrow
is
all
gone
but
then
for
a
moment
it
comes
back
again
but
i
am
at
peace
it
is
all
right
all
right
i
would
not
have
it
otherwise
but
oh
if
he
could
have
spoken
one
word
to
me
before
he
gave
me
this
she
added
when
he
came
home
from
his
first
voyage
to
the
mediterranean
i
did
not
know
it
was
in
this
bag
i
had
looked
for
it
sister
agatha
would
have
told
you
to
make
a
rosary
of
it
said
madame
de
frontignac
but
you
pray
without
a
rosary
it
is
all
one
she
added
there
will
be
a
prayer
for
every
shell
though
you
do
not
count
them
but
come
get
your
bonnet
and
let
us
go
out
on
the
that
evening
before
retiring
scudder
came
into
mary
s
room
her
manner
was
grave
and
tender
her
eyes
had
tears
in
them
and
although
her
usual
habits
were
not
caressing
she
came
to
mary
and
put
her
arms
around
and
kissed
her
it
was
an
unusual
manner
and
mary
s
gentle
eyes
seemed
to
ask
the
reason
of
it
my
daughter
said
her
mother
i
have
just
had
a
long
and
very
interesting
talk
with
our
dear
good
friend
the
doctor
ah
mary
very
few
people
know
how
good
he
true
mother
said
mary
warmly
he
is
the
best
the
noblest
and
yet
the
humblest
man
in
the
you
love
him
very
much
do
you
not
said
her
mother
very
dearly
said
mary
mary
he
has
asked
me
this
evening
if
you
would
be
willing
to
be
his
his
mother
said
mary
in
the
tone
of
one
confused
with
a
new
and
strange
thought
yes
daughter
i
have
long
seen
that
he
was
preparing
to
make
you
this
you
have
mother
yes
daughter
have
you
never
thought
of
it
never
there
was
a
long
pause
mary
standing
just
as
she
had
been
interrupted
in
her
night
toilette
with
her
long
light
hair
streaming
down
over
her
white
dress
and
the
comb
held
mechanically
in
her
hand
she
sat
down
after
a
moment
and
clasping
both
hands
over
her
knees
fixed
her
eyes
intently
on
the
floor
and
there
fell
between
the
two
a
silence
so
intense
that
the
tickings
of
the
clock
in
the
next
room
seemed
to
knock
upon
the
door
scudder
sat
with
anxious
eyes
watching
that
silent
face
pale
as
sculptured
marble
well
mary
she
said
at
last
a
deep
sigh
was
the
only
answer
the
violent
throbbings
of
her
heart
could
be
seen
undulating
the
long
hair
as
the
moaning
sea
tosses
the
rockweed
my
daughter
again
said
scudder
mary
gave
a
great
sigh
like
that
of
a
sleeper
awakening
from
a
dream
and
looking
on
her
mother
said
do
you
suppose
he
really
me
mother
indeed
he
does
mary
as
much
as
man
ever
loved
does
he
indeed
said
mary
relapsing
into
thoughtfulness
and
you
love
him
do
you
not
said
her
mother
oh
yes
i
love
him
you
love
him
better
than
any
man
in
the
world
don
t
you
oh
mother
mother
yes
said
mary
throwing
herself
passionately
forward
and
bursting
into
sobs
yes
there
is
no
one
else
now
that
i
love
better
one
one
my
darling
my
daughter
said
scudder
coming
and
taking
her
in
her
arms
oh
mother
mother
she
said
sobbing
distressfully
let
me
cry
just
for
a
little
mother
mother
mother
what
was
there
hidden
under
that
despairing
wail
was
the
parting
of
the
last
strand
of
the
cord
of
youthful
hope
scudder
soothed
and
caressed
her
daughter
but
maintained
still
in
her
breast
a
tender
pertinacity
of
purpose
such
as
mothers
will
who
think
they
are
conducting
a
child
through
some
natural
sorrow
into
a
happier
state
mary
was
not
one
either
to
yield
long
to
emotion
of
any
kind
her
rigid
education
had
taught
her
to
look
upon
all
such
outbursts
as
a
species
of
weakness
and
she
struggled
for
composure
and
soon
seemed
entirely
calm
if
he
really
loves
me
mother
it
would
give
him
great
pain
if
i
refuse
said
mary
thoughtfully
certainly
it
would
and
mary
you
have
allowed
him
to
act
as
a
very
near
friend
for
a
long
time
and
it
is
quite
natural
that
he
should
have
hopes
that
you
loved
i
do
love
him
mother
than
anybody
in
the
world
except
you
do
you
think
that
will
do
will
do
said
her
mother
i
don
t
understand
why
is
that
loving
enough
to
marry
i
shall
love
him
more
perhaps
after
shall
i
mother
certainly
you
will
every
one
i
wish
he
did
not
want
to
marry
me
mother
said
mary
after
a
pause
i
liked
it
a
great
deal
better
as
we
were
all
girls
feel
so
mary
at
first
it
is
very
is
that
the
way
you
felt
about
father
mother
scudder
s
heart
smote
her
when
she
thought
of
her
own
early
love
great
love
that
asked
no
questions
that
had
no
doubts
no
fears
no
hesitations
nothing
but
one
great
outsweeping
impulse
which
swallowed
her
life
in
that
of
another
she
was
silent
and
after
a
moment
she
said
i
was
of
a
different
disposition
from
you
mary
i
was
of
a
strong
wilful
positive
nature
i
either
liked
or
disliked
with
all
my
might
and
besides
mary
there
never
was
a
man
like
your
the
matron
uttered
this
first
article
in
the
great
confession
of
woman
s
faith
with
the
most
unconscious
simplicity
well
mother
i
will
do
whatever
is
my
duty
i
want
to
be
guided
if
i
can
make
that
good
man
happy
and
help
him
to
do
some
good
in
the
world
all
life
is
short
and
the
great
thing
is
to
do
for
i
am
sure
mary
if
you
could
have
heard
how
he
spoke
you
would
be
sure
you
could
make
him
happy
he
had
not
spoken
before
because
he
felt
so
unworthy
of
such
a
blessing
he
said
i
was
to
tell
you
that
he
should
love
and
honour
you
all
the
same
whether
you
could
feel
to
be
his
wife
or
not
but
that
nothing
this
side
of
heaven
would
be
so
blessed
a
gift
that
it
would
make
up
for
every
trial
that
could
possibly
come
upon
him
you
know
mary
he
has
a
great
many
discouragements
and
trials
don
t
appreciate
him
his
efforts
to
do
good
are
misunderstood
and
misconstrued
they
look
down
on
him
and
despise
him
and
tell
all
sorts
of
evil
things
about
him
and
sometimes
he
gets
quite
yes
mother
i
will
marry
him
said
mary
yes
i
my
darling
daughter
said
scudder
this
has
been
the
hope
of
my
has
it
mother
said
mary
with
a
faint
smile
i
shall
make
you
happier
then
yes
dear
you
will
and
think
what
a
prospect
of
usefulness
opens
before
you
you
can
take
a
position
as
his
wife
which
will
enable
you
to
do
even
more
good
than
you
do
now
and
you
will
have
the
happiness
of
seeing
every
day
how
much
you
comfort
the
hearts
and
encourage
the
hands
of
god
s
dear
mother
i
ought
to
be
very
glad
i
can
do
it
said
mary
and
i
trust
i
am
god
orders
all
things
for
the
well

child

and
we
will

chapter
xxvii
scudder
kissed
her
daughter
and
left
her
after
a
moment
s
thought
mary
gathered
the
long
silky
folds
of
hair
around
her
head
and
knotted
them
for
the
night
then
leaning
forward
on
her
she
folded
her
hands
together
and
stood
regarding
the
reflection
of
herself
in
the
mirror
nothing
is
capable
of
more
ghostly
effect
than
such
a
silent
lonely
contemplation
of
that
mysterious
image
of
ourselves
which
seems
to
look
out
of
an
infinite
depth
in
the
mirror
as
if
it
were
our
own
soul
beckoning
to
us
visibly
from
unknown
regions
those
eyes
look
into
our
own
with
an
expression
sometimes
vaguely
sad
and
inquiring
the
face
wears
weird
and
tremulous
lights
and
shadows
it
asks
us
mysterious
questions
and
troubles
us
with
the
suggestions
of
our
relations
to
some
dim
unknown
the
sad
blue
eyes
that
gazed
into
mary
s
had
that
look
of
calm
initiation
of
melancholy
comprehension
peculiar
to
eyes
made
clairvoyant
by
great
and
critical
sorrow
they
seemed
to
say
to
her
fulfil
thy
mission
life
is
made
for
sacrifice
the
flower
must
fall
before
fruit
can
perfect
a
vague
shuddering
of
mystery
gave
intensity
to
her
reverie
it
seemed
as
if
those
mirror
depths
were
another
world
she
heard
the
dashing
of
waves
she
felt
a
yearning
impulse
towards
that
dear
soul
gone
out
into
the
infinite
unknown
her
word
just
passed
had
in
her
eyes
all
the
sacred
force
of
the
most
vow
and
she
felt
as
if
that
vow
had
shut
some
before
open
door
between
her
and
him
and
she
had
a
kind
of
shadowy
sense
of
a
throbbing
and
yearning
nature
that
seemed
to
call
on
her
seemed
surging
towards
her
with
an
imperative
protesting
force
that
shook
her
heart
to
its
depths
perhaps
it
is
so
that
souls
once
intimately
related
have
ever
after
this
strange
power
of
affecting
each
other
power
that
neither
absence
nor
death
can
annul
how
else
can
we
interpret
these
mysterious
hours
in
which
the
power
of
departed
love
seems
to
overshadow
us
making
our
souls
vital
with
such
longings
with
such
wild
throbbings
with
such
unutterable
sighings
that
a
little
more
might
burst
the
mortal
band
is
it
not
deep
calling
unto
deep
the
free
soul
singing
outside
the
cage
to
her
mate
beating
against
the
bars
within
mary
even
for
a
moment
fancied
that
a
voice
called
her
name
and
started
shivering
then
the
habits
of
her
positive
and
sensible
education
returned
at
once
and
she
came
out
of
her
reverie
as
one
breaks
from
a
dream
and
lifted
all
these
sad
thoughts
with
one
heavy
sigh
from
her
breast
and
opening
her
bible
she
read
they
that
trust
in
the
lord
shall
be
as
mount
zion
that
can
not
be
moved
as
the
mountains
are
round
about
jerusalem
so
the
lord
is
about
his
people
from
this
time
henceforth
and
for
then
she
kneeled
by
her
bedside
and
offered
her
whole
life
a
sacrifice
to
the
loving
god
who
had
offered
his
life
a
sacrifice
for
her
she
prayed
for
grace
to
be
true
to
her
be
faithful
to
the
new
relation
she
had
accepted
she
prayed
that
all
vain
regrets
for
the
past
might
be
taken
away
and
that
her
soul
might
vibrate
without
discord
in
unison
with
the
will
of
eternal
love
so
praying
she
rose
calm
and
with
that
clearness
of
spirit
which
follows
an
act
of
uttermost
and
so
calmly
she
lay
down
and
slept
with
her
two
hands
crossed
upon
her
breast
her
head
slightly
turned
on
the
pillow
her
cheek
pale
as
marble
and
her
long
dark
lashes
lying
drooping
with
a
sweet
expression
as
if
under
that
mystic
veil
of
sleep
the
soul
were
seeing
things
forbidden
to
the
waking
eye
only
the
gentlest
heaving
of
the
quiet
breast
told
that
the
heavenly
spirit
within
had
not
gone
where
it
was
hourly
aspiring
to
go
meanwhile
scudder
had
left
mary
s
room
and
entered
the
doctor
s
study
holding
a
candle
in
her
hand
the
good
man
was
sitting
alone
in
the
dark
with
his
head
bowed
upon
his
bible
when
scudder
entered
he
rose
and
regarded
her
wistfully
but
did
not
speak
he
had
something
just
then
in
his
heart
for
which
he
had
no
words
so
he
only
looked
as
a
man
does
who
hopes
and
fears
for
the
answer
of
a
decided
question
scudder
felt
some
of
the
natural
reserve
which
becomes
a
matron
coming
charged
with
a
gift
in
which
lies
the
whole
sacredness
of
her
own
existence
and
which
she
puts
from
her
hands
with
a
jealous
reverence
she
therefore
measured
the
man
with
her
woman
s
and
mother
s
eye
and
said
with
a
little
stateliness
my
dear
sir
i
come
to
tell
you
the
result
of
my
conversation
with
she
made
a
little
pause
and
the
doctor
stood
before
her
as
humbly
as
if
he
had
not
weighed
and
measured
the
universe
because
he
knew
that
though
he
might
weigh
the
mountains
in
scales
and
the
hills
in
a
balance
yet
it
was
a
far
subtler
power
which
must
possess
him
of
one
small
woman
s
heart
in
fact
he
felt
to
himself
like
a
great
awkward
clumsy
mountainous
earthite
asking
of
a
angel
to
help
him
up
a
ladder
of
cloud
he
was
perfectly
sure
for
the
moment
that
he
was
going
to
be
refused
and
he
looked
humbly
would
take
it
like
a
man
his
large
blue
eyes
generally
so
misty
in
their
calm
had
a
resolute
clearness
rather
mournful
than
otherwise
of
course
no
such
celestial
experience
was
going
to
happen
to
him
he
cleared
his
throat
and
said
well
madam
scudder
s
womanly
dignity
was
appeased
she
reached
out
her
hand
cheerfully
and
said
has
the
doctor
drew
his
hand
suddenly
away
turned
quickly
round
and
walked
to
the
window
although
as
it
was
ten
o
clock
at
night
and
quite
dark
there
was
evidently
nothing
to
be
seen
there
he
stood
there
quietly
swallowing
very
hard
and
raising
his
handkerchief
several
times
to
his
eyes
there
was
enough
went
on
under
the
black
coat
just
then
to
make
quite
a
little
figure
in
a
romance
if
it
had
been
uttered
but
he
belonged
to
a
class
who
romance
but
never
spoke
it
in
a
few
moments
he
returned
to
scudder
and
said
i
trust
dear
madam
that
this
very
dear
friend
may
never
have
reason
to
think
me
ungrateful
for
her
wonderful
goodness
and
whatever
sins
my
evil
heart
may
lead
me
into
i
i
may
never
fall
so
low
as
to
forget
the
undeserved
mercy
of
this
hour
if
ever
i
shrink
from
duty
or
murmur
at
trials
while
so
sweet
a
friend
is
mine
i
shall
be
vile
the
doctor
in
general
viewed
himself
on
the
discouraging
side
and
had
berated
and
snubbed
himself
all
his
life
as
a
most
flagitious
and
person
to
be
narrowly
watched
and
capable
of
breaking
at
any
moment
into
the
most
flagrant
iniquity
and
therefore
it
was
that
he
received
his
good
fortune
in
so
different
a
spirit
from
many
of
the
lords
of
creation
in
similar
circumstances
i
am
sensible
he
added
that
a
poor
minister
without
much
power
of
eloquence
and
commissioned
of
the
lord
to
speak
unpopular
truths
and
whose
worldly
condition
in
consequence
is
never
likely
to
be
very
prosperous
that
such
a
one
could
scarcely
be
deemed
a
suitable
partner
for
so
very
beautiful
a
young
woman
who
might
expect
proposals
in
a
temporal
point
of
view
of
a
much
more
advantageous
nature
and
i
am
therefore
the
more
struck
and
overpowered
with
this
blessed
these
last
words
caught
in
the
doctor
s
throat
as
if
he
were
overpowered
in
very
deed
in
regard
to
happiness
said
the
doctor
with
a
touch
of
awe
in
his
voice
i
would
not
have
presumed
to
become
the
guardian
of
it
were
it
not
that
i
am
persuaded
it
is
assured
by
a
higher
power
for
when
he
giveth
peace
who
then
can
make
trouble
job
xxxv
but
i
trust
i
may
say
no
effort
on
my
part
shall
be
wanting
to
secure
scudder
was
a
mother
and
come
to
that
spot
in
life
where
mothers
always
feel
tears
rising
behind
their
smiles
she
pressed
the
doctor
s
hand
silently
and
they
parted
for
the
night
we
know
not
how
we
can
acquit
ourselves
to
our
friends
of
the
great
world
for
the
details
of
such
an
unfashionable
courtship
so
well
as
by
giving
them
before
they
retire
for
the
night
a
dip
into
a
more
modish
view
of
things
the
doctor
was
evidently
green
green
in
his
faith
green
in
his
simplicity
green
in
his
general
belief
of
the
divine
in
woman
green
in
his
particular
humble
faith
in
one
small
puritan
maiden
whom
a
knowing
fellow
might
at
least
have
manœuvred
so
skilfully
as
to
break
up
her
saintly
superiority
discompose
her
rout
her
ideas
and
lead
her
up
and
down
a
swamp
of
hopes
and
fears
and
conjectures
till
she
was
wholly
bewildered
and
ready
to
take
him
at
he
made
up
his
mind
to
have
her
at
a
great
bargain
for
which
she
was
to
be
sensibly
grateful
yes
the
doctor
was
green
green
as
a
cedar
of
lebanon
which
waving
its
broad
archangel
wings
over
some
eternal
old
solitude
and
seeing
from
its
sublime
height
the
vastness
of
the
universe
veils
its
kingly
head
with
humility
before
god
s
infinite
majesty
he
has
gone
to
bed
now
simple
old
soul
first
apologizing
to
scudder
for
having
kept
her
up
to
so
dissipated
and
unparalleled
an
hour
as
ten
o
clock
on
his
personal
matters
meanwhile
our
asmodeus
will
transport
us
to
an
easily
furnished
apartment
in
one
of
the
most
fashionable
hotels
of
philadelphia
where
aaron
burr
just
returned
from
his
trip
to
the
then
aboriginal
wilds
of
ohio
is
seated
before
a
table
covered
with
maps
letters
books
and
papers
his
keen
eye
runs
over
the
addresses
of
the
letters
and
he
eagerly
seizes
one
from
madame
de
frontignac
and
reads
it
and
as
no
one
but
ourselves
is
looking
at
him
now
his
face
has
no
need
to
wear
its
habitual
mask
first
comes
an
expression
of
profound
astonishment
then
of
chagrin
and
mortification
then
of
deepening
concern
there
were
stops
where
the
dark
eyelashes
flashed
together
as
if
to
brush
a
tear
out
of
the
view
of
the
eyes
and
then
a
red
flush
rose
even
to
his
forehead
and
his
delicate
lips
wore
a
sarcastic
smile
he
laid
down
the
letter
and
made
one
or
two
turns
through
the
room
the
man
had
felt
the
dashing
against
his
own
of
a
strong
generous
indignant
woman
s
heart
fully
awakened
and
speaking
with
that
impassioned
vigour
with
which
a
french
regiment
charges
in
battle
there
were
those
picturesque
winged
words
those
condensed
expressions
those
subtle
piercings
of
meaning
and
above
all
that
simple
pathos
for
which
the
french
tongue
has
no
superior
and
for
the
moment
the
woman
had
the
victory
she
shook
his
heart
but
burr
resembled
the
marvel
with
which
chemists
amuse
themselves
his
heart
was
a
vase
filled
with
boiling
passions
while
his
a
still
cold
unmelted
lump
of
ice
lay
at
the
bottom
is
not
peculiar
to
christians
they
who
go
downward
often
put
forth
as
much
force
to
kill
a
noble
nature
as
another
does
to
annihilate
a
sinful
one
there
was
something
in
this
letter
so
keen
so
searching
so
that
it
brought
on
one
of
those
interior
crises
in
which
a
man
is
convulsed
with
the
struggle
of
two
godlike
and
the
demoniac
and
from
which
he
must
pass
out
more
wholly
to
the
dominion
of
the
one
or
the
other
nobody
knew
the
true
better
than
burr
he
the
and
the
pure
he
had
its
beauty
and
its
force
to
the
very
depths
of
his
being
as
the
demoniac
knew
at
once
the
fair
man
of
nazareth
and
even
now
he
felt
the
voice
within
that
said
what
have
i
to
do
with
thee
and
the
rending
of
a
struggle
of
heavenly
life
with
eternal
death
that
letter
had
told
him
what
he
might
be
and
what
he
was
it
was
as
if
his
dead
mother
s
hand
had
held
up
before
him
a
glass
in
which
he
saw
himself
white
robed
and
crowned
and
so
dazzling
in
purity
that
he
loathed
his
present
self
as
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
perturbed
he
sometimes
wiped
tears
from
his
eyes
and
then
set
his
teeth
and
compressed
his
lips
at
last
his
face
grew
calm
and
settled
in
its
expression
his
mouth
wore
a
sardonic
smile
he
came
and
took
the
letter
and
folding
it
leisurely
laid
it
on
the
table
and
put
a
heavy
paper
weight
over
it
as
if
to
hold
it
down
and
bury
it
then
drawing
to
himself
some
maps
of
new
territories
he
set
himself
vigorously
to
some
columns
of
arithmetical
calculations
on
the
margin
and
thus
he
worked
for
an
hour
or
two
till
his
mind
was
as
dry
and
his
pulse
as
calm
as
a
machine
then
he
drew
the
inkstand
towards
him
and
scribbled
hastily
the
following
letter
to
his
most
confidential
letter
which
told
no
more
of
the
conflict
that
preceded
it
than
do
the
dry
sands
and
civil
gossip
of
the
of
the
storm
and
wreck
of
last
week
once
more
in
philadelphia
our
schemes
in
ohio
prosper
frontignac
remains
there
to
superintend
he
answers
our
purpose
on
the
whole
i
don
t
see
as
we
could
do
better
than
retain
him
he
is
beside
a
gentlemanly
agreeable
person
and
wholly
devoted
to
point
certainly
not
to
be
overlooked
as
to
your
railleries
about
the
fair
madame
i
must
say
in
justice
both
to
her
and
myself
that
any
grace
with
which
she
has
been
pleased
to
honour
me
is
not
to
be
misconstrued
you
are
not
to
imagine
any
but
the
most
platonic
of
she
is
as
high
strung
as
an
arabian
steed
proud
romantic
and
and
such
must
be
permitted
to
take
their
own
time
and
way
which
we
in
our
can
only
humbly
wonder
at
i
have
ever
professed
myself
her
abject
slave
ready
to
follow
any
whim
and
obeying
the
slightest
signal
of
the
jewelled
hand
as
that
is
her
sacred
pleasure
i
have
been
inhabiting
the
most
abstract
realms
of
heroic
sentiment
living
on
the
most
diluted
moonshine
and
spinning
out
elaborately
all
those
charming
and
seraphic
distinctions
between
and
with
which
these
ecstatic
creatures
delight
themselves
in
certain
stages
of
du
the
last
development
on
the
part
of
my
goddess
is
a
fit
of
celestial
anger
of
the
cause
of
which
i
am
in
the
most
innocent
ignorance
she
writes
me
three
pages
of
french
sublimities
writing
as
only
a
french
woman
can
bids
me
an
eternal
adieu
and
informs
me
she
is
going
to
newport
of
course
the
affair
becomes
stimulating
i
am
not
to
presume
to
dispute
her
sentence
or
doubt
a
lady
s
perfect
sincerity
in
wishing
never
to
see
me
again
but
yet
i
think
i
shall
try
to
pacify
the
tantas
in
animis
celestibus
if
a
woman
hates
you
it
is
only
her
love
turned
wrong
side
out
and
you
may
turn
it
back
with
due
care
the
pretty
creatures
know
how
becoming
a
passion
is
and
take
care
to
keep
themselves
in
mind
a
quarrel
serves
their
turn
when
all
else
fails
to
another
point
i
wish
you
to
advertise
that
his
insinuations
in
regard
to
me
in
the
aurora
have
been
observed
and
that
i
require
that
they
be
promptly
retracted
he
knows
me
well
enough
to
attend
to
this
hint
i
am
in
earnest
when
i
speak
if
the
word
does
nothing
the
blow
will
come
and
if
i
strike
once
no
second
blow
will
be
needed
yet
i
do
not
wish
to
get
him
on
my
hands
needlessly
a
duel
and
a
love
affair
and
hot
weather
coming
on
together
might
prove
too
much
even
for
me
thermometer
stands
at
i
am
resolved
on
newport
next
week
yours
ever
burr
i
forgot
to
say
that
oddly
enough
my
goddess
has
gone
and
placed
herself
under
the
wing
of
the
pretty
puritan
i
saw
in
newport
fancy
the
could
anything
be
more
piquant
of
goodness
the
old
doctor
sweet
little
saint
and
madame
faubourg
germain
shaken
up
together
her
listening
with
astonishment
to
a
critique
on
the
doings
of
the
unregenerate
or
flirting
that
little
jewelled
fan
of
hers
in
scudder
s
square
pew
of
a
sunday
probably
they
will
carry
her
to
the
weekly
which
of
course
she
will
find
some
fine
french
subtlety
for
admiring
and
i
fancy
i
see
when
burr
had
finished
this
letter
he
had
actually
written
himself
into
a
sort
of
persuasion
of
its
truth
when
a
nature
wishes
to
go
into
baseness
it
has
first
to
bribe
itself
evil
is
never
embraced
undisguised
as
evil
but
under
some
fiction
which
the
mind
accepts
and
with
which
it
has
the
singular
power
of
blinding
itself
in
the
face
of
daylight
the
power
of
imposing
on
one
s
self
is
an
essential
preliminary
to
imposing
on
others
the
man
first
argues
himself
down
and
then
he
is
ready
to
put
the
whole
weight
of
his
nature
to
deceiving
others
this
letter
ran
so
smoothly
so
plausibly
that
it
produced
on
the
writer
of
it
the
effect
of
a
work
of
fiction
which
we
to
be
unreal
but
to
be
true
long
habits
of
this
kind
of
in
time
produce
a
paralysis
in
the
vital
nerves
of
truth
so
that
one
becomes
habitually
unable
to
see
things
in
their
verity
and
realizes
the
awful
words
of
scripture
he
feedeth
on
ashes
a
deceived
heart
hath
turned
him
aside
so
that
he
can
not
deliver
his
soul
nor
say
is
there
not
a
lie
in
my
right
hand
chapter
xxviii
between
three
and
four
the
next
morning
the
robin
in
the
nest
above
mary
s
room
stretched
out
his
left
wing
opened
one
eye
and
gave
a
short
and
rather
drowsy
chirp
which
broke
up
his
night
s
rest
and
restored
him
to
the
full
consciousness
that
he
was
a
bird
with
wings
and
large
to
live
in
and
all
heaven
for
an
so
on
these
fortunate
premises
he
broke
into
a
gush
of
singing
clear
and
loud
which
mary
without
waking
heard
in
her
slumbers
scarcely
conscious
she
lay
in
that
dim
clairvoyant
state
when
the
of
the
outward
senses
permits
a
delicious
dewy
clearness
of
the
soul
that
perfect
ethereal
rest
and
freshness
of
faculties
comparable
only
to
what
we
imagine
of
the
spiritual
state
season
of
celestial
enchantment
in
which
the
heavy
weight
of
all
this
unintelligible
world
drops
off
and
the
soul
divinely
charmed
nestles
like
a
bird
in
the
protecting
bosom
of
the
one
all
perfect
all
beautiful
what
visions
then
come
to
the
inner
eye
have
often
no
words
corresponding
in
mortal
vocabularies
the
poet
the
artist
and
the
prophet
in
such
hours
become
possessed
of
divine
which
all
their
lives
they
struggle
with
pencil
or
song
or
burning
words
to
make
evident
to
their
fellows
the
world
around
wonders
but
are
unsatisfied
because
they
have
the
and
know
how
inadequate
the
copy
but
not
merely
to
selectest
spirits
come
these
hours
but
to
those
humble
poets
ungifted
with
utterance
who
are
among
men
as
fountains
sealed
whose
song
can
be
wrought
out
only
by
the
harmony
of
deeds
the
patient
pathetic
melodies
of
tender
endurance
or
the
heroic
chant
of
undiscouraged
labour
the
poor
slave
woman
last
night
parted
from
her
only
boy
and
weary
with
the
the
captive
pining
in
his
cell
the
patient
wife
of
the
drunkard
saddened
by
a
consciousness
of
the
growing
vileness
of
one
once
so
dear
the
delicate
spirit
doomed
to
harsh
and
uncongenial
surroundings
in
such
hours
feel
the
soothings
of
a
celestial
harmony
the
tenderness
of
more
than
a
mother
s
love
it
is
by
such
hours
as
these
often
more
than
by
reasonings
or
disputings
that
doubts
are
resolved
in
the
region
of
religious
faith
the
treats
us
as
the
mother
does
her
infant
crying
in
the
dark
he
does
not
reason
with
our
fears
or
demonstrate
their
fallacy
but
draws
us
silently
to
his
bosom
and
we
are
at
peace
nay
there
have
been
those
undoubtedly
who
have
known
god
falsely
with
the
intellect
yet
felt
him
truly
with
the
heart
and
there
may
be
many
principally
among
the
unlettered
little
ones
of
christ
s
flock
who
positively
that
much
that
is
dogmatically
propounded
to
them
of
their
redeemer
is
cold
barren
unsatisfying
and
even
utterly
false
who
yet
can
give
no
account
of
their
certainties
better
than
that
of
the
inspired
fisherman
we
know
him
and
have
seen
it
was
in
such
hours
as
these
that
mary
s
deadly
fears
for
the
soul
of
her
beloved
had
passed
away
passed
out
of
her
as
if
some
warm
healing
nature
of
tenderest
vitality
had
drawn
out
of
her
heart
all
pain
and
coldness
and
warmed
it
with
the
breath
of
an
eternal
summer
so
while
the
purple
shadows
spread
their
gauzy
veils
inwove
with
fire
along
the
sky
and
the
gloom
of
the
sea
broke
out
here
and
there
into
lines
of
light
and
thousands
of
birds
were
answering
to
each
other
from
and
and
top
of
jagged
rock
or
trooping
in
bands
hither
and
thither
like
angels
on
loving
messages
mary
lay
there
with
the
flickering
light
through
the
leaves
fluttering
over
her
face
and
the
glow
of
dawn
warming
the
draperies
of
the
bed
and
giving
a
tender
rose
hue
to
the
calm
cheek
she
lay
half
conscious
smiling
the
while
as
one
who
sleeps
while
the
heart
waketh
and
who
hears
in
dreams
the
voice
of
the
one
eternally
beautiful
and
beloved
scudder
entered
her
room
and
thinking
that
she
still
slept
stood
and
looked
down
upon
her
she
felt
as
one
does
who
has
parted
with
some
precious
possession
a
sudden
sense
of
its
value
coming
over
her
and
she
queried
in
herself
whether
any
living
mortal
were
worthy
of
so
perfect
a
gift
and
nothing
but
a
remembrance
of
the
doctor
s
prostrate
humility
at
all
reconciled
her
to
the
sacrifice
she
was
making
mary
dear
she
said
bending
over
her
with
an
unusual
infusion
of
emotion
in
her
voice
darling
the
arms
moved
instinctively
even
before
the
eyes
unclosed
and
drew
her
mother
down
to
her
with
a
warm
clinging
embrace
love
in
puritan
families
was
often
like
latent
caloric
force
that
affected
no
visible
thermometer
shown
chiefly
by
a
noble
silent
confidence
a
ready
helpfulness
but
seldom
in
caresses
natures
like
mary
s
always
craved
these
outward
demonstrations
and
sprang
towards
them
as
a
trailing
vine
sways
to
the
nearest
support
it
was
delightful
for
once
fully
to
how
much
her
mother
loved
her
as
well
as
to
it
dear
precious
mother
do
you
love
me
so
very
much
i
live
and
breathe
in
you
mary
said
scudder
giving
vent
to
herself
in
one
of
those
trenchant
expressions
wherein
positive
natures
incline
to
résumé
when
they
must
speak
at
all
mary
held
her
mother
silently
to
her
breast
her
heart
shining
through
her
face
with
a
quiet
radiance
of
love
do
you
feel
happy
this
morning
said
scudder
very
very
happy
i
am
so
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
said
scudder
who
to
say
the
truth
had
entertained
many
doubts
at
her
pillow
the
night
before
mary
began
dressing
herself
in
a
state
of
calm
exaltation
every
trembling
leaf
on
the
tree
every
sunbeam
was
like
a
loving
smile
of
god
every
fluttering
breeze
like
his
voice
full
of
encouragement
and
hope
mother
did
you
tell
the
doctor
what
i
said
last
night
i
did
my
then
mother
i
would
like
to
see
him
a
few
moments
well
mary
he
is
in
his
study
at
his
morning
that
is
just
the
time
i
will
go
to
the
doctor
was
sitting
by
the
window
and
the
motherly
lilacs
for
the
third
time
since
our
story
began
were
filling
the
air
with
their
sweetness
suddenly
the
door
opened
and
mary
entered
in
her
simple
white
and
skirt
her
eyes
calmly
radiant
and
her
whole
manner
having
something
serious
and
celestial
she
came
directly
towards
him
and
put
out
both
her
little
hands
with
a
smile
half
half
angelic
and
the
doctor
bowed
his
head
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
dear
friend
said
mary
kneeling
and
taking
his
hands
if
you
want
me
i
am
come
life
is
but
a
moment
there
is
an
eternal
blessedness
just
beyond
us
and
for
the
little
time
between
i
will
be
all
i
can
to
you
if
you
will
only
show
me
and
the
no
young
man
the
study
door
closed
just
then
and
no
one
heard
those
words
from
a
quaint
old
oriental
book
which
told
that
all
the
poetry
of
that
grand
old
soul
had
burst
into
flower
as
the
aloe
blossoms
once
in
a
hundred
years
the
ripples
of
that
great
heart
might
have
fallen
unconsciously
into
phrases
from
that
one
love
poem
of
the
bible
which
these
men
read
so
purely
and
devoutly
and
which
warmed
the
icy
clearness
of
their
intellects
with
the
myrrh
and
spices
of
ardent
lands
where
earthly
and
heavenly
love
meet
and
blend
in
one
indistinguishable
horizon
line
like
sea
and
sky
who
is
she
that
looketh
forth
as
the
morning
fair
as
the
moon
clear
as
the
sun
my
dove
my
undefiled
is
but
one
she
is
the
only
one
of
her
art
all
fair
my
beloved
there
is
no
spot
in
the
doctor
might
have
said
all
this
we
will
not
say
he
did
nor
will
we
say
he
did
not
all
we
know
is
that
when
the
was
ready
they
came
out
cheerfully
together
madame
de
frontignac
stood
in
a
fresh
white
wrapper
with
a
few
buttercups
in
her
hair
waiting
for
the
breakfast
she
was
startled
to
see
the
doctor
entering
all
radiant
leading
in
mary
by
the
hand
and
looking
as
if
he
thought
she
were
some
which
might
dissolve
under
his
eyes
unless
he
kept
fast
hold
of
her
the
keen
eyes
shot
their
arrowy
glance
which
went
at
once
to
the
heart
of
the
matter
madame
de
frontignac
knew
they
were
engaged
and
regarded
mary
with
attention
the
calm
sweet
elevated
expression
of
her
face
struck
her
it
struck
her
also
that
was
not
the
light
of
any
earthly
love
that
it
had
no
thrill
no
blush
no
tremor
but
only
the
calmness
of
a
soul
that
knows
itself
no
more
and
she
sighed
involuntarily
she
looked
at
the
doctor
and
seemed
to
study
attentively
a
face
which
happiness
had
made
this
morning
as
genial
and
attractive
as
it
was
generally
strong
and
fine
there
was
little
said
at
the
this
morning
and
yet
the
loud
singing
of
the
birds
the
brightness
of
the
sunshine
the
life
and
vigour
of
all
things
seemed
to
make
up
for
the
silence
of
those
who
were
too
well
pleased
to
speak
bien
ma
said
madame
after
breakfast
drawing
mary
into
her
little
room
est
fini
yes
said
mary
cheerfully
thou
art
content
said
madame
passing
her
arm
around
her
well
then
i
should
be
but
mary
it
is
like
a
marriage
with
the
altar
like
taking
the
veil
is
it
not
no
said
mary
it
is
not
taking
the
veil
it
is
beginning
a
cheerful
reasonable
life
with
a
kind
noble
friend
who
will
always
love
me
truly
and
whom
i
hope
to
make
as
happy
as
he
i
think
well
of
him
my
little
cat
said
madame
reflectively
she
stopped
something
she
was
going
to
say
and
kissed
mary
s
forehead
after
a
moment
s
pause
she
added
one
must
have
love
or
refuge
mary
this
is
thy
refuge
child
thou
wilt
have
peace
in
it
she
sighed
again
she
said
resuming
her
gay
tone
what
shall
be
toilette
de
thou
shalt
have
verginie
s
pearls
my
fair
one
and
look
like
a
venus
let
me
try
them
in
thy
and
in
a
few
moments
she
had
mary
s
long
hair
down
and
was
chattering
like
a
blackbird
wreathing
the
pearls
in
and
out
and
saying
a
thousand
pretty
nothings
weaving
grace
and
poetry
into
the
strait
thread
of
puritan
life
chapter
xxix
the
quilting
the
announcement
of
the
definite
engagement
of
two
such
bright
particular
stars
in
the
hemisphere
of
the
doctor
s
small
parish
excited
the
interest
that
such
events
usually
create
among

faithful
of

was
a
general
rustle
and
flutter

of

speedily
flying
through
the
consecrated
air
of
the
parish
the
fact
was
discussed
by
matrons
and
maidens
at
the
and
in
the
green
or
at
the
foaming
out
of
which
arose
a
new
birth
of
weekly
freshness
and
beauty
many
a
rustic
venus
of
the
foam
as
she
splashed
her
dimpled
elbows
in
the
froth
talked
what
should
be
done
for
the
forthcoming
solemnities
and
wondered
what
mary
would
have
on
when
she
was
married
and
whether
she
the
venus
should
get
an
invitation
to
the
wedding
and
whether
ethan
would
that
she
cared
in
the
least
whether
he
did
or
not
grave
elderly
matrons
talked
about
the
prosperity
of
zion
which
they
imagined
intimately
connected
with
the
event
of
their
minister
s
marriage
and
descending
from
zion
speculated
on
and
and
rummaged
their
own
clean
stores
fragrant
with
balm

out

that
she
fairly
couldn

sleep
nights
with
the
responsibility
of
the

her
mind
but
yet
she
must
give
one
day
to
getting
on

called
in
her
own
particular
carriage
bearing
the
present
of
a
cashmere
shawl
for
the
bride
with
the
general
s
best
compliments
and
also
an
pattern
for
quilting
which
had
been
sent
her
from
england
and
which
was
authentically
established
to
be
that
used
on
a
petticoat
belonging
to
the
princess
royal
and
major
seaforth
came
also
bearing
a
scarf
of
worked

muslin
and
vernon
sent
a
splendid
indian
china
indeed
to
say
the
truth
the
notables
high
and
mighty
of
newport
whom
the
doctor
had
so
unceremoniously
accused
of
building
their
houses
with
blood
and
establishing
their
city
with
iniquity
considering
that
nobody
seemed
to
take
his
words
to
heart
and
that
they
were
making
money
as
fast
as
old
tyre
rather
assumed
the
magnanimous
and
patted
themselves
on
the
shoulder
for
this
opportunity
to
show
the
doctor
that
after
all
they
were
good
fellows
and
bore
him
no
malice
though
they
did
make
money
at
the
expense
of
thirty
per
cent
human
life
simeon
brown
was
the
only
exception
he
stood
aloof
grim
and
sarcastic
and
informed
some
good
ladies
who
came
to
see
if
he
would
as
they
phrased
it
esteem
it
a
privilege
to
add
his
mite
to
the
doctor
s
outfit
that
he
would
give
him
a
likely
negro
boy
if
he
wanted
and
if
he
was
too
conscientious
to
keep
him
he
might
sell
him
at
a
fair
profit
a
happy
stroke
of
humour
which
he
was
fond
of
relating
many
years
after
the
quilting
was
in
these
days
considered
as
the
most
solemn
and
important
recognition
of
a
betrothal
and
for
the
benefit
of
those
not
to
the
manner
born
a
little
preliminary
instruction
may
be
necessary
the
good
wives
of
new
england
impressed
with
that
thrifty
orthodoxy
of
economy
which
forbids
to
waste
the
merest
trifle
had
a
habit
of
saving
every
scrap
and
fragment
clipped
out
in
the
fashioning
of
household
garments
and
these
they
cut
into
fanciful
patterns
and
constructed
of
them
rainbow
shapes
and
quaint
traceries
the
arrangement
of
which
became
one
of
their
few
fine
arts
many
a
maiden
as
she
sorted
and
arranged
fluttering
bits
of
green
yellow
red
and
blue
felt
rising
in
her
breast
a
passion
for
somewhat
vague
and
unknown
which
came
out
at
length
in
a
new
pattern
of
patchwork
and
collections
of
these
tiny
fragments
were
always
ready
to
fill
an
hour
when
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
and
as
the
maiden
chatted
with
her
beaux
her
busy
flying
needle
stitched
together
the
pretty
morsels
which
little
in
themselves
were
destined
by
gradual
unions
and
accretions
to
bring
about
at
last
substantial
beauty
warmth
and
comfort
emblems
thus
of
that
household
life
which
is
to
be
brought
to
stability
and
beauty
by
reverent
economy
in
husbanding
and
tact
in
arranging
the
little
useful
and
agreeable
morsels
of
daily
existence
when
a
wedding
was
forthcoming
then
there
was
a
solemn
review
of
the
stores
of
beauty
and
utility
thus
provided
and
the
best
worthy
of
such
distinction
was
chosen
for
the
quilting
thereto
duly
summoned
trooped
all
intimate
female
friends
of
the
bride
and
the
quilt
being
spread
on
a
frame
and
wadded
with
cotton
each
vied
with
the
other
in
the
delicacy
of
the
quilting
they
could
put
upon
it
for
quilting
also
was
a
fine
art
and
had
its
delicacies
and
nice
points
concerning
which
grave
elderly
matrons
discussed
with
judicious
care
the
quilting
generally
began
at
an
early
hour
in
the
afternoon
and
ended
at
dusk
with
a
great
supper
and
general
jubilee
in
which
that
ignorant
and
incapable
sex
who
could
not
quilt
were
allowed
to
appear
and
put
in
claims
for
consideration
of
another
nature
it
may
perhaps
be
surmised
that
this
expected
reinforcement
was
often
alluded
to
by
the
younger
maidens
whose
wickedly
coquettish
toilettes
exhibited
suspicious
marks
of
that
willingness
to
get
a
chance
to
say
no
which
has
been
slanderously
attributed
to
mischievous
maidens
in
consequence
of
the
tremendous
responsibilities
involved
in
this
quilting
the
reader
will
not
be
surprised
to
learn
that
the
evening
before
miss
prissy
made
her
appearance
at
the
brown
cottage
armed
with
thimble
scissors
and
pincushion
in
order
to
relieve
her
mind
by
a
little
preliminary
confabulation
you
see
me
miss
scudder
run
almost
to
death
she
said
but
i
thought
i
would
just
run
up
to
major
seaforth
s
and
see
her
best
bedroom
quilt
cause
i
wanted
to
have
all
the
ideas
we
possibly
could
before
i
decided
on
the
pattern
hers
is
in
common
shells
nothing
to
be
compared
with
miss
wilcox
s
and
i
suppose
there
isn
t
the
least
doubt
that
miss
wilcox
s
sister
in
london
did
get
that
from
a
lady
who
had
a
cousin
who
was
governess
in
the
royal
family
and
i
just
quilted
a
little
bit
on
an
old
piece
of
silk
and
it
comes
out
beautiful
and
so
i
thought
i
would
just
come
and
ask
you
if
you
did
not
think
it
was
best
for
us
to
have
the
well
certainly
miss
prissy
if
you
think
so
said
scudder
who
was
as
pliant
to
the
opinions
of
this
wise
woman
of
the
parish
as
new
england
matrons
generally
are
to
a
reigning
dressmaker
and
factotum
miss
prissy
had
the
happy
consciousness
always
that
her
early
advent
under
any
roof
was
considered
a
matter
of
special
grace
and
therefore
it
was
with
rather
a
patronizing
tone
that
she
announced
that
she
would
stay
and
spend
the
night
with
them
i
knew
she
added
that
your
spare
chamber
was
full
with
that
madame
de
if
i
was
to
die
i
could
not
remember
the
woman
s
name
well
i
thought
i
could
just
crawl
in
with
you
mary
most
that
s
right
miss
prissy
said
mary
you
shall
be
welcome
to
half
my
bed
any
well
i
knew
you
would
say
so
mary
i
never
saw
the
thing
you
would
not
give
away
half
of
since
you
was
that
high
said
miss
prissy
illustrating
her
words
by
placing
her
hand
about
two
feet
from
the
floor
just
at
this
moment
madame
de
frontignac
entered
and
asked
mary
to
come
into
her
room
and
give
her
advice
as
to
a
piece
of
embroidery
when
she
was
gone
out
miss
prissy
looked
after
her
and
sank
her
voice
once
more
to
the
confidential
whisper
which
we
before
described
i
have
heard
strange
stories
about
that
french
woman
she
said
but
as
she
was
here
with
you
and
mary
i
suppose
there
can
not
be
any
truth
in
them
dear
me
the
world
is
so
censorious
about
women
but
then
you
know
we
don
t
expect
much
from
french
women
i
suppose
she
is
a
roman
catholic
and
worships
pictures
and
stone
images
but
then
after
all
she
has
got
an
immortal
soul
and
i
can
t
help
hoping
mary
s
influence
may
be
blest
to
her
they
say
when
she
speaks
french
she
swears
every
few
minutes
but
if
that
is
the
way
she
was
brought
up
maybe
she
isn
t
accountable
i
think
we
can
t
be
too
charitable
for
people
that
a
n
t
privileged
as
we
are
miss
vernon
s
polly
told
me
she
has
seen
her
sew
sabbath
day
she
came
into
her
room
of
a
sudden
and
she
was
working
on
her
embroidery
there
and
she
never
winked
nor
blushed
nor
offered
to
put
it
away
but
sat
there
just
as
easy
polly
said
she
never
was
so
beat
in
all
her
life
she
felt
kind
o
scared
every
time
she
thought
of
it
but
now
she
has
come
here
who
knows
but
she
may
be
converted
mary
has
not
said
much
about
her
state
of
mind
said
scudder
but
something
of
deep
interest
has
passed
between
them
mary
is
such
an
uncommon
child
that
i
trust
everything
to
we
will
not
dwell
further
on
the
particulars
of
this
evening
nor
describe
how
madame
de
frontignac
reconnoitred
miss
prissy
with
keen
amused
eyes
nor
how
miss
prissy
apprised
mary
in
the
confidential
solitude
of
her
chamber
that
her
fingers
just
itched
to
get
hold
of
that
trimming
on
that
madame
de
frogsneck
s
dress
because
she
was
pretty
nigh
sure
she
could
make
some
just
like
it
for
she
never
saw
any
trimming
she
could
not
make
the
robin
that
lived
in
the
was
fairly
the
next
morning
for
miss
prissy
was
up
before
him
tripping
about
the
chamber
on
the
points
of
her
toes
and
knocking
down
all
the
moveable
things
in
the
room
in
her
efforts
to
be
still
so
as
not
to
waken
mary
and
it
was
not
until
she
had
finally
upset
the
stand
by
the
bed
with
the
candlestick
snuffers
and
bible
on
it
that
mary
opened
her
eyes
miss
prissy
dear
me
what
is
it
you
are
doing
why
i
am
trying
to
be
still
mary
so
as
not
to
wake
you
up
and
it
seems
to
me
as
if
everything
was
possessed
to
tumble
down
so
but
it
is
only
three
so
you
turn
over
and
go
to
but
miss
prissy
said
mary
sitting
up
in
bed
you
are
all
dressed
where
are
you
going
well
to
tell
the
truth
mary
i
am
just
one
of
those
people
that
can
t
sleep
when
they
have
got
responsibility
on
their
minds
and
i
ve
been
lying
awake
more
than
an
hour
here
thinking
about
that
quilt
there
is
a
new
way
of
getting
it
on
to
the
frame
that
i
want
to
try
cause
you
know
when
we
quilted
cerinthy
stebbins
it
would
trouble
us
in
the
rolling
and
i
have
got
a
new
way
that
i
want
to
try
and
i
mean
just
to
get
it
into
the
frame
before
breakfast
i
was
in
hopes
i
should
get
out
without
waking
any
of
you
and
now
i
don
t
know
as
i
shall
get
by
your
mother
s
door
without
waking
her
cause
i
know
she
works
hard
and
needs
her
rest
but
that
bedroom
door
squawks
like
a
to
raise
the
dead
mary
she
added
with
sudden
energy
if
i
had
the
least
drop
of
oil
in
a
teacup
and
a
bit
of
quill
i
d
stop
that
door
making
such
a
and
miss
prissy
s
eyes
glowed
with
resolution
i
don
t
know
where
you
could
find
any
at
this
time
said
mary
well
never
mind
i
ll
just
go
and
open
the
door
as
slow
and
careful
as
i
can
said
miss
prissy
as
she
trotted
out
of
the
apartment
the
result
of
her
carefulness
was
very
soon
announced
to
mary
by
a
protracted
sound
resembling
the
mewing
of
a
hoarse
cat
accompanied
with
sundry
audible
grunts
from
miss
prissy
terminating
in
a
grand
finale
of
clatter
occasioned
by
her
knocking
down
all
the
pieces
of
the
that
stood
in
a
corner
of
the
room
with
a
concussion
that
roused
everybody
in
the
house
what
is
that
called
out
scudder
from
her
bedroom
she
was
answered
by
two
streams
of
laughter
one
from
mary
sitting
up
in
bed
and
the
other
from
miss
prissy
holding
her
sides
as
she
sat
dissolved
in
merriment
on
the
sanded
floor
chapter
xxx
by
six
o
clock
in
the
morning
miss
prissy
came
out
of
the
best
room
to
the
with
the
air
of
a
general
who
has
arranged
a
campaign
her
face
glowing
with
satisfaction
all
sat
down
together
to
their
morning
meal
the
outside
door
was
open
into
the
green
turfy
yard
and
the
now
nursing
stores
of
fine
yellow
jennetings
looked
in
at
the
window
every
once
in
a
while
as
a
breeze
shook
the
leaves
a
fully
ripe
apple
might
be
heard
falling
to
the
ground
at
which
miss
prissy
would
bustle
up
from
the
table
and
rush
to
secure
the
treasure
as
the
meal
waxed
to
its
close
the
rattling
of
wheels
was
heard
at
the
gate
and
candace
was
discerned
seated
aloft
in
the
waggon
with
her
usual
complements
of
baskets
and
bags
well
now
dear
me
if
there
is
not
candace
said
miss
prissy
i
do
believe
marvyn
has
sent
her
with
something
for
the
quilting
and
out
she
flew
as
nimble
as
a
while
those
in
the
house
heard
various
exclamations
of
admiration
as
candace
with
stately
dignity
disinterred
from
the
waggon
one
basket
after
another
and
exhibited
to
miss
prissy
s
enraptured
eyes
sly
peeps
under
the
white
napkins
by
which
they
were
covered
and
then
lodging
a
large
basket
on
either
arm
she
rolled
majestically
towards
the
house
like
a
indiaman
coming
in
after
a
fat
voyage
good
morning
scudder
good
morning
doctor
she
said
dropping
her
curtsy
on
the
good
morning
miss
mary
you
see
our
folks
were
stirring
pretty
early
this
morning
and
marvyn
sent
me
down
with
two
or
three
little
setting
down
her
baskets
on
the
floor
and
seating
herself
between
them
she
proceeded
to
develop
their
contents
with
triumph
one
basket
was
devoted
to
cakes
of
every
species
from
the
great
mont
blanc
with
its
snowy
glaciers
of
frosting
to
the
twisted
cruller
and
puffy
in
the
other
basket
lay
pots
of
golden
butter
curiously
stamped
reposing
on
a
bed
of
fresh
green
leaves
while
currants
red
and
white
and
delicious
cherries
and
raspberries
gave
a
final
finish
to
the
picture
from
a
basket
which
miss
prissy
brought
in
from
the
rear
appeared
cold
fowl
and
tongue
delicately
prepared
and
shaded
with
feathers
of
parsley
candace
whose
rollicking
delight
in
the
good
things
of
this
life
was
conspicuous
in
every
emotion
might
have
famished
to
a
painter
as
she
sat
in
a
brilliant
turban
an
idea
for
an
african
genius
of
plenty

how
many
steps
must
be
taken
such
times
and
we
agreed
you
ought
to
favour
yourselves
all
you
well
now
said
miss
prissy
lifting
up
her
hands
if
that
a
n
t
what
tis
to
have
friends
why
that
was
one
of
the
things
i
was
thinking
of
as
i
lay
awake
last
night
because
you
know
at
times
like
these
people
run
their
feet
off
before
the
time
begins
and
then
they
are
all
limpsey
and
when
the
time
comes
now
i
say
candace
all
scudder
and
mary
have
to
do
is
to
give
everything
up
to
us
and
we
ll
put
it
through
that
s
what
we
will
said
candace
just
show
me
what
s
to
be
done
and
i
ll
do
candace
and
miss
prissy
soon
disappeared
together
into
the
pantry
with
the
baskets
whose
contents
they
began
busily
to
arrange
candace
shut
the
door
that
no
sound
might
escape
and
began
a
confidential
outpouring
to
miss
prissy
you
see
she
said
i
has
all
the
while
for
miss
marvyn
cause
yer
see
she
was
expectin
if
ever
mary
was
it
would
be
to
somebody
else
you
miss
prissy
responded
with
a
sympathetic
groan
well
said
candace
if
it
had
been
anybody
but
the
doctor
would
not
have
been
resigned
but
after
all
he
has
done
for
my
colour
there
a
n
t
nothing
i
could
find
it
in
my
heart
to
grudge
him
but
then
i
was
tellin
cato
the
other
day
says
i
cato
i
don
t
know
about
the
rest
of
the
world
but
i
ha
n
t
never
felt
it
in
my
bones
that
master
james
is
really
dead
for
sartin
now
i
feels
things
but
things
i
feels
my
and
them
always
comes
true
and
that
ar
is
a
feelin
i
ha
n
t
had
about
master
jim
yet
and
that
ar
is
what
i
m
waitin
for
fore
i
clear
make
up
my
mind
tho
i
know
cordin
to
all
white
folks
way
o
thinkin
there
a
n
t
no
hope
cause
squire
marvyn
he
had
that
jeduth
pettibone
up
to
his
house
a
questioning
on
him
off
and
on
nigh
about
three
hours
and
reely
i
didn
t
see
no
hope
no
way
except
just
this
as
i
was
tellin
cato
can
t
feel
it
in
my
candace
was
not
versed
enough
in
the
wisdom
of
the
world
to
know
that
she
belonged
to
a
large
and
respectable
school
of
philosophers
in
this
particular
mode
of
testing
evidence
which
after
all
the
reader
will
perceive
has
its
conveniences
another
thing
said
candace
as
much
as
a
dozen
times
dis
yer
last
year
when
i
have
been
knives
a
fork
has
fell
and
stuck
straight
up
in
the
floor
and
the
last
time
i
pinted
it
out
to
miss
marvyn
and
she
only
just
said
why
what
of
that
candace
well
said
miss
prissy
i
don
t
believe
in
but
then
strange
things
do
happen
now
about
dogs
howling
under
windows
why
i
don
t
believe
in
it
a
bit
but
i
never
knew
it
fail
that
there
was
a
death
in
the
house
ah
i
tell
ye
what
said
candace
looking
mysterious
dogs
knows
a
heap
more
than
they
likes
to
tell
just
so
said
miss
prissy
now
i
remember
one
night
when
i
was
watching
with
miss
colonel
andrews
after
martha
ann
was
born
that
we
heard
the
howling
that
ever
you
did
hear
it
seemed
to
come
from
right
under
the
front
stoop
and
miss
andrews
she
just
dropped
the
spoon
in
her
gruel
and
says
she
miss
prissy
do
for
pity
s
sake
just
go
down
and
see
what
that
noise
and
i
went
down
and
lifted
up
one
of
the
loose
boards
of
the
stoop
and
what
should
i
see
there
but
their
newfoundland
pup
there
that
creature
had
dug
a
grave
and
was
by
it
candace
drew
near
to
miss
prissy
dark
with
expressive
interest
as
her
voice
in
this
awful
narration
sank
to
a
whisper
well
said
candace
after
miss
prissy
had
made
something
of
a
pause
well
i
told
miss
andrews
i
didn
t
think
there
was
anything
in
it
said
miss
prissy
but
she
added
impressively
she
lost
a
very
dear
brother
six
months
after
and
i
laid
him
out
with
my
own
laid
him
out
in
white
some
folks
say
said
candace
that
dreaming
about
white
horses
is
a
certain
sign
jinny
styles
is
very
strong
about
that
now
she
came
down
one
morning
crying
cause
she
had
been
dreaming
about
white
horses
and
she
was
sure
she
should
hear
some
friend
was
dead
and
sure
enough
a
man
came
in
that
day
and
told
her
that
her
son
was
drown
d
out
in
the
harbour
and
jinny
said
there
she
was
sure
that
sign
never
would
but
then
ye
see
that
night
he
came
home
jinny
wan
t
reely
disappointed
but
she
always
insisted
he
was
good
as
any
way
cause
he
sank
three
well
i
tell
you
said
miss
prissy
there
are
a
great
many
more
things
in
this
world
than
folks
know
so
they
are
said
candace
now
i
ha
n
t
never
opened
my
mind
to
nobody
but
there
s
a
dream
i
ve
had
three
mornings
running
lately
i
dreamed
i
see
jim
marvyn
in
the
water
and
stretching
up
his
hands
and
then
i
dreamed
that
i
see
the
lord
jesus
come
on
the
water
and
take
hold
of
his
hand
and
says
he
o
thou
of
little
faith
wherefore
didst
thou
doubt
and
then
he
lifted
him
right
out
and
i
ha
n
t
said
nothing
to
nobody
cause
you
know
the
doctor
says
people
must
not
mind
nothing
about
their
dreams
cause
dreams
belong
to
the
old
well
well
well
said
miss
prissy
i
am
sure
i
don
t
know
what
to
think
what
time
in
the
morning
was
it
that
you
dreamed
it
why
said
candace
it
was
just
after
i
kinder
always
wakes
myself
then
and
turns
over
and
what
comes
after
that
is
apt
to
run
well
well
well
said
miss
prissy
i
don
t
know
what
to
think
you
see
it
may
have
reference
to
the
state
of
his
i
know
that
said
candace
but
as
nigh
as
i
could
judge
in
my
dream
she
added
sinking
her
voice
and
looking
mysterious
as
nigh
as
i
can
judge
boy
s
soul
was
in
his
why
how
do
you
know
said
miss
prissy
looking
astonished
at
the
confidence
with
which
candace
expressed
her
opinion
well
ye
see
said
candace
rather
mysteriously
the
doctor
he
don
t
like
to
have
us
talk
much
about
these
things
cause
he
thinks
it
s
kind
o
heathenish
but
then
folks
as
is
used
to
seein
such
things
knows
the
look
of
a
sperit
of
the
body
from
the
look
of
a
sperit
in
the
body
just
as
easy
as
you
can
tell
mary
from
the
at
this
moment
scudder
opened
the
and
put
an
end
to
this
mysterious
conversation
which
had
already
so
affected
miss
prissy
that
in
the
eagerness
of
her
interest
she
had
rubbed
up
her
cap
border
and
ribbon
into
rather
an
elfin
and
goblin
style
as
if
they
had
been
ruffled
up
by
a
breeze
from
the
land
of
spirits
and
she
flew
around
for
a
few
moments
in
a
state
of
great
nervous
agitation
upsetting
dishes
knocking
down
plates
and
huddling
up
contrary
suggestions
as
to
what
ought
to
be
done
first
in
such
impossible
relations
that
katy
scudder
stood
in
dignified
surprise
at
this
strange
freak
of
conduct
in
the
wise
woman
of
the
parish
a
dim
consciousness
of
something
not
quite
canny
in
herself
appeared
to
strike
her
for
she
made
a
vigorous
effort
to
appear
composed
and
facing
scudder
with
an
air
of
dignified
suavity
inquired
if
it
would
not
be
best
to
put
jim
marvyn
in
the
oven
now
while
candace
was
getting
the
pies
ready
meaning
of
course
a
large
turkey
which
was
to
be
the
first
in
an
indefinite
series
to
be
baked
that
morning
and
discovering
by
scudder
s
dazed
expression
and
a
vigorous
pinch
from
candace
that
somehow
she
had
not
improved
matters
she
rubbed
her
spectacles
in
a
diagonal
manner
across
her
eyes
and
stood
glaring
through
them
with
a
helpless
expression
which
in
a
less
judicious
person
might
have
suggested
the
idea
of
a
state
of
slight
intoxication
but
the
exigencies
of
an
immediate
temporal
dispensation
put
an
end
to
miss
prissy
s
unwonted
vagaries
and
she
was
soon
to
be
seen
flying
round
like
a
meteor
dusting
shaking
curtains
counting
napkins
wiping
and
sorting
china
all
with
such
rapidity
as
to
give
rise
to
the
idea
that
she
actually
existed
in
forty
places
at
once
candace
whom
the
limits
of
her
corporeal
frame
restricted
to
an
altogether
different
style
of
locomotion
often
rolled
the
whites
of
her
eyes
after
her
and
gave
vent
to
her
views
of
her
proceedings
in
sententious
expressions
do
you
know
why
never
was
married
she
said
to
mary
as
she
stood
looking
after
her
miss
prissy
had
made
one
of
those
rapid
transits
through
the
apartment
no
answered
mary
innocently
why
was
not
she
because
never
was
a
man
could
run
fast
enough
to
catch
her
said
candace
and
then
her
portly
person
shook
with
the
impulse
of
her
own
wit
by
two
o
clock
a
goodly
company
began
to
assemble
deacon
twitchel
arrived
soft
pillowy
and
plaintive
as
ever
accompanied
by
cerinthy
ann
a
comely
damsel
tall
and
trim
with
a
bright
black
eye
and
a
most
vigorous
and
determined
style
of
movement
good
jones
broad
expansive
and
solid
having
vegetated
tranquilly
on
in
the
cabbage
garden
of
the
virtues
since
three
years
ago
when
she
graced
our
was
now
as
well
preserved
as
ever
and
brought
some
fresh
butter
a
tin
pail
of
cream
and
a
loaf
of
cake
made
on
a
new
philadelphia
receipt
the
tall
spare
angular
figure
of
simeon
brown
only
was
wanting
but
she
patronized
scudder
no
more
and
tossed
her
head
with
a
becoming
pride
when
her
name
was
mentioned
the
was
gloriously
drawn
in
done
in
indigo
and
soon
all
the
company
young
and
old
were
passing
busy
fingers
over
it
and
conversation
went
on
briskly
madame
de
frontignac
we
must
not
forget
to
say
had
entered
with
hearty
into
the
spirit
of
the
day
she
had
dressed
the
tall
china
vases
on
the
mantelpieces
and
departing
from
the
usual
rule
of
an
equal
mixture
of
roses
and
asparagus
bushes
had
constructed
two
quaint
and
graceful
bouquets
where
garden
flowers
were
mingled
with
drooping
grasses
and
trailing
wild
vines
forming
a
graceful
combination
which
excited
the
surprise
of
all
who
saw
it
it
s
the
very
first
time
in
my
life
that
i
ever
saw
grass
put
into
a
said
miss
prissy
but
i
must
say
it
looks
as
handsome
as
a
pictur
mary
i
must
say
she
added
in
an
aside
i
think
that
madame
de
frongenac
is
the
sweetest
dressing
and
appearing
creature
i
ever
saw
she
don
t
dress
up
nor
put
on
airs
but
she
seems
to
see
in
a
minute
how
things
ought
to
go
and
if
it
s
only
a
bit
of
grass
or
leaf
or
wild
vine
that
she
puts
in
her
hair
why
it
seems
to
come
just
right
i
should
like
to
make
her
a
dress
for
i
know
she
would
understand
my
fit
do
speak
to
her
mary
in
case
she
should
want
a
dress
fitted
here
to
let
me
try
at
the
quilting
madame
de
frontignac
would
have
her
seat
and
soon
won
the
respect
of
the
party
by
the
dexterity
with
which
she
used
her
needle
though
when
it
was
whispered
that
she
learned
to
quilt
among
the
nuns
some
of
the
elderly
ladies
exhibited
a
slight
uneasiness
as
being
rather
doubtful
whether
they
might
not
be
encouraging
papistical
opinions
by
allowing
her
an
equal
share
in
the
work
of
getting
up
their
minister
s
but
the
younger
part
of
the
company
were
quite
captivated
by
her
foreign
air
and
the
pretty
manner
in
which
she
lisped
her
english
and
cerinthy
ann
even
went
so
far
as
to
horrify
her
mother
by
saying
that
she
wished
she
d
been
educated
in
a
convent
herself
declaration
which
arose
less
from
native
depravity
than
from
a
certain
vigorous
disposition
which
often
shows
itself
in
young
people
to
shock
the
current
opinions
of
their
elders
and
betters
of
course
the
conversation
took
a
general
turn
somewhat
in
unison
with
the
spirit
of
the
occasion
and
whenever
it
flagged
some
allusion
to
a
forthcoming
wedding
or
some
sly
hint
to
the
future
young
madam
of
the
parish
was
sufficient
to
awake
the
dormant
animation
of
the
company
cerinthy
ann
contrived
to
produce
an
agreeable
electric
shock
by
declaring
that
for
her
part
she
never
could
see
into
it
how
any
girl
could
marry
a
she
should
as
soon
think
of
setting
up
housekeeping
in
a
o
cerinthy
ann
exclaimed
her
mother
how
can
you
go
on
so
it
s
a
fact
said
the
adventurous
damsel
now
other
men
let
you
have
some
peace
but
a
minister
s
always
round
under
your
so
you
think
the
less
you
see
of
a
husband
the
better
said
one
of
the
ladies
just
my
views
said
cerinthy
giving
a
decided
snip
to
her
thread
with
her
scissors
i
like
the
nantucketers
that
go
off
on
four
years
voyages
and
leave
their
wives
a
clear
field
if
ever
i
get
married
i
m
going
up
to
have
one
of
those
it
is
to
be
remarked
in
passing
that
miss
cerinthy
ann
was
at
this
very
time
receiving
surreptitious
visits
from
a
conscientious
young
theological
candidate
who
came
occasionally
to
preach
in
the
vicinity
and
put
up
at
the
house
of
the
deacon
her
father
this
good
young
man
being
violently
attacked
on
the
doctrine
of
election
by
miss
cerinthy
had
been
drawn
on
to
illustrate
it
in
a
most
practical
manner
to
her
comprehension
and
it
was
the
consciousness
of
the
weak
and
tottering
state
of
the
internal
garrison
that
added
vigour
to
the
young
lady
s
tones
as
mary
had
been
the
chosen
confidant
of
the
progress
of
this
affair
she
was
quietly
amused
at
the
demonstration
you
d
better
take
care
cerinthy
ann
said
her
mother
they
say
that
those
who
sing
before
breakfast
will
cry
before
girls
talk
about
getting
married
she
said
relapsing
into
a
gentle
didactic
melancholy
without
realizing
its
awful
oh
as
to
that
said
cerinthy
i
ve
been
practising
on
my
pudding
now
these
six
years
and
i
shouldn
t
be
afraid
to
throw
one
up
chimney
with
any
this
speech
was
founded
on
a
tradition
current
in
those
times
that
no
young
lady
was
fit
to
be
married
till
she
could
construct
a
boiled
of
such
durability
that
it
could
be
thrown
up
chimney
and
come
down
on
the
ground
outside
without
breaking
and
the
consequence
of
cerinthy
ann
s
sally
was
a
general
laugh
girls
a
n
t
what
they
used
to
be
in
my
day
sententiously
remarked
an
elderly
lady
i
remember
my
mother
told
me
when
she
was
thirteen
she
could
knit
a
long
cotton
stocking
in
a
i
haven
t
much
faith
in
these
stories
of
old
times
have
you
girls
said
cerinthy
appealing
to
the
younger
members
at
the
frame
at
any
rate
said
twitchel
our
minister
s
wife
will
be
a
pattern
i
don
t
know
anybody
as
goes
beyond
her
either
in
spinning
or
fine
mary
sat
as
placid
and
disengaged
as
the
new
moon
and
listened
to
the
chatter
of
old
and
young
with
the
easy
quietness
of
a
young
heart
that
has
early
outlived
life
and
looks
on
everything
in
the
world
from
some
gentle
restful
eminence
far
on
towards
a
better
home
she
smiled
at
everybody
s
word
had
a
quick
eye
for
everybody
s
wants
and
was
ready
with
thimble
scissors
or
thread
whenever
any
one
needed
them
but
once
when
there
was
a
pause
in
the
conversation
she
and
marvyn
were
both
discovered
to
be
stolen
away
they
were
seated
on
the
bed
in
mary
s
little
room
with
their
arms
around
each
other
communing
in
low
and
gentle
tones
mary
my
dear
child
said
her
friend
this
event
is
very
pleasant
to
me
because
it
places
you
permanently
near
me
i
did
not
know
but
eventually
this
sweet
face
might
lead
to
my
losing
you
who
are
in
some
respects
the
dearest
friend
i
you
might
be
sure
said
mary
i
never
would
have
married
except
that
my
mother
s
happiness
and
the
happiness
of
so
good
a
friend
seem
to
depend
on
it
when
we
renounce
self
in
anything
we
have
reason
to
hope
god
s
blessing
and
so
i
feel
assured
of
a
peaceful
life
in
the
course
i
have
taken
you
will
always
be
as
a
mother
to
me
she
added
laying
her
head
on
her
friend
s
shoulder
yes
said
marvyn
and
i
must
not
let
myself
think
a
moment
how
dear
it
might
have
been
to
have
you
my
own
if
you
feel
really
truly
happy
if
you
can
enter
on
this
life
without
any
i
can
said
mary
firmly
at
this
instant
very
strangely
the
string
which
confined
a
wreath
of
around
her
glass
having
been
long
undermined
by
moths
suddenly
broke
and
fell
down
scattering
the
shells
upon
the
floor
both
women
started
for
the
string
of
shells
had
been
placed
there
by
james
and
though
neither
were
superstitious
this
was
one
of
those
odd
coincidences
that
make
hearts
throb
dear
boy
said
mary
gathering
the
shells
up
tenderly
wherever
he
is
i
shall
never
cease
to
love
him
it
makes
me
feel
sad
to
see
this
come
down
but
it
is
only
an
accident
nothing
of
him
will
ever
fail
out
of
my
marvyn
clasped
mary
closer
to
her
with
tears
in
her
eyes
i
ll
tell
you
what
mary
it
must
have
been
the
moths
did
that
said
miss
prissy
who
had
been
standing
unobserved
at
the
door
for
a
moment
back
moths
will
eat
away
strings
just
so
last
week
vernon
s
great
family
picture
fell
down
because
the
moths
eat
through
the
cord
people
ought
to
use
twine
or
cotton
string
always
but
i
came
to
tell
you
that
the
supper
is
all
set
and
the
doctor
out
of
his
study
and
all
the
people
are
wondering
where
you
mary
and
marvyn
gave
a
hasty
glance
at
themselves
in
the
glass
to
be
assured
of
their
good
keeping
and
went
into
the
great
kitchen
where
a
long
table
stood
exhibiting
all
that
plenitude
of
provision
which
the
immortal
description
of
washington
irving
has
saved
us
the
trouble
of
representing
in
detail
the
husbands
brothers
and
lovers
had
come
in
and
the
scene
was
redolent
of
gaiety
when
mary
made
her
appearance
there
was
a
moment
s
pause
till
she
was
conducted
to
the
side
of
the
doctor
when
raising
his
hand
he
invoked
a
grace
upon
the
loaded
board
unrestrained
gaieties
followed
groups
of
young
men
and
maidens
chatted
together
and
all
the
gallantries
of
the
times
were
enacted
serious
matrons
commented
on
the
cake
and
told
each
other
high
and
particular
secrets
in
the
culinary
art
which
they
drew
from
remote
family
archives
one
might
have
learned
in
that
instructive
assembly
how
best
to
keep
moths
out
of
blankets
how
to
make
fritters
of
indian
corn
undistinguishable
from
oysters
how
to
bring
up
babies
by
hand
and
how
to
mend
a
cracked
teapot
and
how
to
take
out
grease
from
a
brocade
and
how
to
reconcile
absolute
decrees
with
free
will
and
how
to
make
five
yards
of
cloth
answer
the
purpose
of
six
and
how
to
put
down
the
democratic
party
all
were
busy
earnest
and
certain
just
as
a
swarm
of
men
and
women
old
and
young
are
in
miss
prissy
was
in
her
glory
every
bow
of
her
best
cap
was
alive
with
excitement
and
she
presented
to
the
eyes
of
astonished
newport
gentry
an
animated
some
of
the
information
she
communicated
indeed
was
so
valuable
and
important
that
she
could
not
trust
the
air
with
it
but
whispered
the
most
important
portions
in
a
confidential
tone
among
the
crowd
cerinthy
ann
s
theological
admirer
was
observed
in
deeply
reflective
attitude
and
that
young
lady
added
further
to
his
convictions
of
the
total
depravity
of
the
species
by
vexing
and
discomposing
him
in
those
thousand
ways
in
which
a
lively
young
woman
will
put
to
rout
a
serious
young
man
comforting
herself
with
the
reflection
that
she
would
repent
of
all
her
sins
in
a
lump
together
vain
transitory
splendours
even
this
evening
so
glorious
so
so
fruitful
in
instruction
and
amusement
could
not
last
for
ever
gradually
the
company
broke
up
the
matrons
mounted
soberly
on
horseback
behind
their
spouses
and
cerinthy
consoled
her
clerical
friend
by
giving
him
an
opportunity
to
read
her
a
lecture
on
the
way
home
if
he
found
the
courage
to
do
so
and
marvyn
and
candace
wound
their
way
soberly
homeward
the
doctor
returned
to
his
study
for
nightly
devotions
and
before
long
sleep
settled
down
on
the
brown
cottage
i
ll
tell
you
what
cato
said
candace
before
composing
herself
to
sleep
i
can
t
feel
it
in
my
bones
dat
dis
yer
wedding
is
going
to
come
off
chapter
xxxi
a
day
or
two
after
madame
de
frontignac
and
mary
went
out
to
gather
shells
and
seaweed
on
the
beach
it
was
four
o
clock
and
the
afternoon
sun
was
hanging
in
the
sultry
sky
of
july
with
a
hot
and
vaporous
stillness
the
whole
air
was
full
of
blue
haze
that
softened
the
outlines
of
objects
without
hiding
them
the
sea
lay
like
so
much
glass
every
ship
and
boat
was
double
every
line
and
rope
and
spar
had
its
counterpart
and
it
seemed
hard
to
say
which
was
the
most
real
the
under
or
the
upper
world
madame
de
frontignac
and
mary
had
brought
along
a
little
basket
which
they
were
filling
with
shells
and
the
former
was
in
high
spirits
she
ran
and
shouted
and
exclaimed
and
wondered
at
each
new
marvel
thrown
out
upon
the
shore
with
the
of
a
little
child
mary
could
not
but
wonder
whether
this
indeed
were
she
whose
strong
words
had
pierced
and
wrung
her
sympathies
the
other
night
and
whether
a
deep
could
lie
bleeding
under
those
brilliant
eyes
and
that
infantine
exuberance
of
gaiety
yet
surely
all
that
which
seemed
so
strong
so
true
so
real
could
not
be
gone
so
soon
it
could
not
be
so
soon
consoled
mary
wondered
at
her
as
the
constitution
with
its
strong
firm
intensity
its
singleness
of
nature
wonders
at
the
mobile
existence
of
warmer
races
whose
versatility
of
emotion
on
the
surface
is
not
incompatible
with
the
most
intense
sameness
lower
down
mary
s
was
one
of
those
indulgent
and
tolerant
natures
which
seem
to
form
the
most
favourable
base
for
the
play
of
other
minds
rather
than
to
be
itself
salient
something
about
her
tender
calmness
always
seemed
to
provoke
the
spirit
of
frolic
in
her
friend
she
would
laugh
at
her
kiss
her
gambol
round
her
dress
her
hair
with
fantastic
and
call
her
all
sorts
of
fanciful
and
poetic
names
in
french
or
english
while
mary
surveyed
her
with
a
pleased
and
innocent
surprise
as
a
revelation
of
character
altogether
new
and
different
from
anything
to
which
she
had
been
hitherto
accustomed
she
was
to
her
a
living
pantomime
and
brought
into
her
unembellished
life
the
charms
of
opera
and
theatre
and
romance
after
wearying
themselves
with
their
researches
they
climbed
round
a
point
of
rock
that
stretched
some
way
out
into
the
sea
and
attained
to
a
little
kind
of
grotto
where
the
high
cliffs
shut
out
the
rays
of
the
sun
they
sat
down
to
rest
upon
the
rocks
a
fresh
breeze
of
declining
day
was
springing
up
and
bringing
the
rising
tide
landward
several
line
of
waves
with
their
white
crest
coming
up
and
breaking
gracefully
on
the
hard
sparkling
at
their
feet
mary
s
eyes
fixed
themselves
as
they
were
apt
to
do
in
a
mournful
reverie
on
the
infinite
expanse
of
waters
which
was
now
broken
and
chopped
into
thousand
incoming
waves
by
the
fresh
afternoon
breeze
madame
de
frontignac
noticed
the
expression
and
began
to
play
with
her
as
if
she
had
been
a
child
she
pulled
the
comb
from
her
hair
and
let
down
its
long
silky
waves
upon
her
shoulders
now
said
she
let
us
make
a
miranda
of
thee
this
is
our
cave
i
will
be
prince
ferdinand
burr
told
me
all
about
that
reads
beautifully
and
explained
it
all
to
me
what
a
lovely
story
that
is
must
be
so
happy
who
know
how
to
read
shakspeare
without
learning
i
will
put
this
shell
on
your
forehead
has
a
hole
here
and
i
will
pass
this
gold
chain
what
a
pity
this
seaweed
will
not
be
pretty
out
of
water
it
has
no
effect
but
there
is
some
green
that
will
do
me
fasten
it
so
now
fair
miranda
look
at
where
is
the
girl
so
angelic
as
not
to
feel
a
slight
curiosity
to
know
how
she
shall
look
in
a
new
and
strange
costume
mary
bent
over
the
rock
where
a
little
pool
of
water
lay
in
a
brown
hollow
above
the
fluctuations
of
the
tide
dark
and
still
like
a
mirror
saw
a
fair
face
with
a
white
shell
above
the
forehead
and
drooping
wreaths
of
green
seaweed
in
the
silken
hair
and
a
faint
blush
and
smile
rose
on
the
cheek
giving
the
last
finish
to
the
picture
how
do
you
find
yourself
said
madame
confess
now
that
i
have
a
true
talent
in
coiffure
now
i
will
be
she
turned
quickly
and
her
eye
was
caught
by
something
that
mary
did
not
see
she
only
saw
the
smile
fade
suddenly
from
madame
de
frontignac
s
cheek
and
her
lips
grow
deadly
white
while
her
heart
beat
so
that
mary
could
notice
its
flutterings
under
her
black
silk
bodice
will
the
punish
the
rash
presumption
of
a
mortal
who
intrudes
said
colonel
burr
stepping
before
them
with
a
grace
as
invincible
and
assured
as
if
he
had
never
had
any
past
history
with
either
mary
started
with
a
guilty
blush
like
a
child
detected
in
an
unseemly
frolic
and
put
her
hand
to
her
head
to
take
off
the
unwonted
adornments
let
me
protest
in
the
name
of
the
graces
said
burr
who
by
that
time
stood
with
easy
calmness
at
her
side
and
as
he
spoke
he
stayed
her
hand
with
that
gentle
air
of
authority
which
made
it
the
natural
impulse
of
most
people
to
obey
him
it
would
be
treason
against
the
picturesque
he
added
to
spoil
that
toilet
so
charmingly
uniting
the
wearer
to
the
mary
was
taken
by
surprise
and
discomposed
as
every
one
is
who
finds
one
s
self
masquerading
in
attire
foreign
to
their
usual
habits
and
character
and
therefore
when
she
would
persist
in
taking
it
to
pieces
burr
found
sufficient
to
alleviate
the
embarrassment
of
madame
de
frontignac
s
utter
silence
in
a
playful
run
of
protestations
and
compliments
i
think
mary
said
madame
de
frontignac
that
we
had
better
be
returning
to
the
this
was
said
in
the
haughtiest
and
coolest
tone
imaginable
looking
at
the
place
where
burr
stood
as
if
there
were
nothing
there
but
empty
air
mary
rose
to
go
madame
de
frontignac
offered
her
arm
permit
me
to
remark
ladies
said
burr
with
the
quiet
suavity
which
never
forsook
him
that
your
very
agreeable
occupations
have
caused
time
to
pass
more
rapidly
than
you
are
aware
i
think
you
will
find
that
the
tide
has
risen
so
as
to
intercept
the
path
by
which
you
came
here
you
will
hardly
be
able
to
get
around
the
point
of
rocks
without
some
mary
looked
a
few
paces
ahead
and
saw
a
little
before
them
a
fresh
afternoon
breeze
driving
the
rising
tide
high
on
to
the
side
of
the
rocks
at
whose
foot
their
course
had
lain
the
nook
in
which
they
had
been
sporting
formed
a
part
of
a
shelving
ledge
which
inclined
over
their
heads
and
which
it
was
just
barely
possible
could
be
climbed
by
a
strong
and
agile
person
but
which
would
be
wholly
inaccessible
to
a
frail
unaided
woman
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
said
burr
coolly
measuring
the
possibilities
with
that
keen
eye
that
was
never
discomposed
by
any
exigency
i
am
at
your
service
ladies
i
can
either
carry
you
in
my
arms
around
this
point
or
assist
you
up
these
he
paused
and
waited
for
their
answer
madame
de
frontignac
stood
pale
cold
and
silent
hearing
only
the
wild
beating
of
her
heart
i
think
said
mary
that
we
should
try
the
very
well
said
burr
and
placing
his
gloved
hand
on
a
fragment
of
rock
somewhat
above
their
heads
he
swung
himself
on
to
it
with
an
easy
agility
from
this
he
stretched
himself
down
as
far
as
possible
towards
them
and
extending
his
hand
directed
mary
who
stood
foremost
to
set
her
foot
on
a
slight
projection
and
give
him
both
her
hands
she
did
so
and
he
seemed
to
draw
her
up
as
easily
as
if
she
had
been
a
feather
he
placed
her
by
him
on
a
shelf
of
rock
and
turned
again
to
madame
de
frontignac
she
folded
her
arms
and
turned
resolutely
away
towards
the
sea
just
at
that
moment
a
coming
wave
broke
at
her
feet
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
said
burr
there
s
a
tremendous
wave
coming
in
and
the
next
wave
may
carry
you
she
responded
without
turning
her
head
oh
verginie
verginie
exclaimed
mary
and
stretching
her
arms
over
the
rock
but
another
voice
called
verginie
in
a
tone
which
went
to
her
heart
she
turned
and
saw
those
dark
eyes
full
of
tears
oh
come
he
said
with
that
voice
which
she
could
never
resist
she
put
her
cold
trembling
hands
into
his
and
he
drew
her
up
and
placed
her
safely
beside
mary
a
few
moments
of
difficult
climbing
followed
in
which
his
arm
was
thrown
now
around
one
and
then
around
the
other
and
they
felt
themselves
carried
with
a
force
as
if
the
slight
and
graceful
form
were
strung
with
steel
placed
in
safety
on
the
top
of
the
bank
there
was
a
natural
gush
of
grateful
feeling
towards
their
deliverer
the
severest
resentment
the
coolest
moral
disapprobation
are
necessarily
somewhat
softened
when
the
object
of
them
has
just
laid
one
under
a
personal
obligation
burr
did
not
seem
disposed
to
press
his
advantage
and
treated
the
incident
as
the
most
affair
in
the
world
he
offered
an
arm
to
each
lady
with
the
air
of
a
gentleman
who
offers
a
necessary
support
and
each
took
it
because
neither
wished
under
the
circumstances
to
refuse
he
walked
along
leisurely
homeward
talking
in
that
easy
quiet
natural
way
in
which
he
excelled
addressing
no
very
particular
remark
to
either
one
and
at
the
door
of
the
cottage
took
his
leave
saying
as
he
bowed
that
he
hoped
neither
of
them
would
feel
any
inconvenience
from
their
exertions
and
that
he
should
do
himself
the
pleasure
to
call
soon
and
inquire
after
their
health
madame
de
frontignac
made
no
reply
but
curtsied
with
a
stately
grace
turned
and
went
into
her
little
room
whither
mary
after
a
few
minutes
followed
her
she
found
her
thrown
upon
the
bed
her
face
buried
in
the
pillow
her
breast
heaving
as
if
she
were
sobbing
but
when
at
mary
s
entrance
she
raised
her
head
her
eyes
were
bright
and
dry
it
is
just
as
i
told
you
mary
man
holds
me
i
love
him
yet
in
spite
of
myself
it
is
in
vain
to
be
angry
what
is
the
use
of
striking
your
right
hand
with
your
left
when
we
one
more
than
ourselves
we
only
hurt
ourselves
with
our
but
said
mary
love
is
founded
on
respect
and
esteem
and
when
that
is
why
then
said
madame
we
are
very
sorry
but
we
love
yet
do
we
stop
loving
ourselves
when
we
have
lost
our
own
no
it
is
so
disagreeable
to
see
we
shut
our
eyes
and
ask
to
have
the
bandage
put
on
know
poor
little
heart
you
can
think
how
it
would
have
been
with
you
if
you
had
found
that
he
was
not
what
you
the
word
struck
home
to
mary
s
consciousness
but
she
sat
down
and
took
her
friend
in
her
arms
with
an
air
serious
rational
i
see
and
feel
it
all
dear
verginie
but
i
must
stand
firm
for
you
you
are
in
the
waves
and
i
on
the
shore
if
you
are
so
weak
at
heart
you
must
not
see
this
man
any
but
he
will
i
will
see
him
for
what
will
you
tell
him
my
heart
him
that
i
am
ill
perhaps
no
i
will
tell
him
the
truth
you
do
not
wish
to
see
that
is
hard
will
i
think
not
said
mary
resolutely
and
furthermore
i
shall
say
to
him
that
while
madame
de
frontignac
is
at
the
cottage
it
will
not
be
agreeable
for
us
to
receive
calls
from
mary
you
astonish
me
my
dear
friend
said
mary
it
is
the
only
way
this
man
cruel
wicked
deceitful
man
not
be
allowed
to
trifle
with
you
in
this
way
i
will
protect
and
she
rose
up
with
flashing
eye
and
glowing
cheek
looking
as
her
father
looked
when
he
protested
against
the
thou
art
my
saint
catherine
said
verginie
rising
up
excited
by
mary
s
enthusiasm
and
hast
the
sword
as
well
as
the
palm
but
dear
saint
don
t
think
so
very
very
badly
of
him
has
a
noble
nature
he
has
the
angel
in
the
greater
his
sin
said
mary
he
sins
against
light
and
but
i
think
his
heart
is
touched
think
he
is
sorry
oh
mary
if
you
had
only
seen
how
he
looked
at
me
when
he
put
out
his
hands
on
the
rocks
were
tears
in
his
well
there
might
be
said
mary
i
do
not
think
he
is
quite
a
fiend
no
one
could
look
at
those
cheeks
dear
verginie
and
not
feel
sad
that
saw
you
a
few
months
am
i
so
changed
she
said
rising
and
looking
at
herself
in
the
mirror
sure
enough
my
neck
used
to
be
quite
round
you
can
see
those
two
little
bones
like
rocks
at
low
tide
poor
verginie
her
summer
is
gone
and
the
leaves
are
falling
poor
little
cat
verginie
stroked
her
own
chestnut
head
as
if
she
had
been
pitying
another
and
began
humming
a
little
norman
air
with
a
refrain
that
sounded
like
the
murmur
of
a
brook
over
the
stones
the
more
mary
was
touched
by
these
little
poetic
ways
which
ran
just
on
an
even
line
between
the
gay
and
the
pathetic
the
more
indignant
she
grew
with
the
man
that
had
brought
all
this
sorrow
she
felt
a
saintly
vindictiveness
and
a
determination
to
place
herself
as
an
adamantine
shield
between
him
and
her
friend
there
is
no
courage
and
no
anger
like
that
of
a
gentle
woman
when
once
fully
roused
if
ever
you
have
occasion
to
meet
it
you
will
certainly
remember
the
hour
chapter
xxxii
mary
revolved
the
affairs
of
her
friend
in
her
mind
during
the
night
the
intensity
of
the
mental
crisis
through
which
she
herself
had
just
passed
had
developed
her
in
many
inward
respects
so
that
she
looked
upon
life
no
longer
as
a
timid
girl
but
as
a
strong
experienced
woman
she
had
thought
and
suffered
and
held
converse
with
eternal
realities
until
thousands
of
mere
earthly
hesitations
and
timidities
that
often
restrain
a
young
and
untried
nature
had
entirely
lost
their
hold
upon
her
besides
mary
had
at
heart
the
puritan
seed
of
heroism
absent
from
the
souls
of
true
new
england
women
her
essentially
hebrew
education
trained
in
daily
converse
with
the
words
of
prophets
and
seers
and
with
the
modes
of
thought
of
a
grave
and
heroic
people
predisposed
her
to
a
kind
of
exaltation
which
in
times
of
great
trial
might
rise
to
the
heights
of
the
religious
sublime
in
which
the
impulse
of
and
protection
took
a
form
essentially
commanding
the
very
intensity
of
the
repression
under
which
her
faculties
developed
seemed
as
it
were
to
produce
a
surplus
of
hidden
strength
which
came
out
in
exigencies
her
reading
though
restricted
to
few
volumes
had
been
of
the
kind
that
vitalized
and
stimulated
a
poetic
nature
and
laid
up
in
its
chambers
vigorous
words
and
trenchant
phrases
for
the
use
of
an
excited
that
eloquence
came
to
her
as
a
native
gift
she
realized
in
short
in
her
higher
hours
the
last
touch
with
which
milton
finishes
his
portrait
of
an
ideal
woman
greatness
of
mind
and
nobleness
their
seat
build
in
her
loftiest
and
create
an
awe
about
her
as
a
guard
angelic
the
next
morning
colonel
burr
called
at
the
cottage
mary
was
spinning
in
the
garret
and
madame
de
frontignac
was
reeling
yarn
when
scudder
brought
this
announcement
mother
said
mary
i
wish
to
see
burr
alone
madame
de
frontignac
will
not
go
scudder
looked
surprised
but
asked
no
questions
when
she
was
gone
down
mary
stood
a
moment
reflecting
madame
de
frontignac
looked
eager
and
agitated
remember
and
notice
all
he
says
and
just
how
he
looks
mary
so
as
to
tell
me
and
be
sure
and
say
that
i
thank
him
for
his
kindness
yesterday
we
must
own
he
appeared
very
well
there
did
he
not
certainly
said
mary
but
no
man
could
have
done
ah
but
mary
not
every
man
could
have
done
it
as
he
did
now
don
t
be
too
hard
on
him
mary
i
have
said
dreadful
things
to
him
i
am
afraid
i
have
been
too
severe
after
all
these
distinguished
men
are
so
tempted
we
don
t
know
how
much
they
are
tempted
and
who
can
wonder
that
they
are
a
little
spoiled
so
my
angel
you
must
be
merciful
said
mary
kissing
the
pale
cheek
and
feeling
the
cold
little
hands
that
trembled
in
hers
so
you
will
go
down
in
your
little
spinning
toilette
ma
i
fancy
you
look
as
joan
of
arc
did
when
she
was
keeping
her
sheep
at
doremi
go
and
god
bless
thee
and
madame
de
frontignac
pushed
her
playfully
forward
mary
entered
the
room
where
burr
was
seated
and
wished
him
good
morning
in
a
serious
and
placid
manner
in
which
there
was
not
the
slightest
trace
of
embarrassment
or
discomposure
shall
i
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
your
fair
companion
this
morning
said
burr
after
some
moments
of
indifferent
conversation
no
sir
madame
de
frontignac
desires
me
to
excuse
her
to
is
she
ill
said
burr
with
a
look
of
concern
no
burr
she
prefers
not
to
see
burr
gave
a
start
of
surprise
and
mary
added
madame
de
frontignac
has
made
me
familiar
with
the
history
of
your
acquaintance
with
her
and
you
will
therefore
understand
what
i
mean
burr
when
i
say
that
during
the
time
of
her
stay
with
us
we
would
prefer
not
to
receive
calls
from
your
language
miss
scudder
has
certainly
the
merit
of
i
intend
it
shall
have
sir
said
mary
tranquilly
half
the
misery
of
the
world
comes
of
want
of
courage
to
speak
and
to
hear
the
truth
plainly
and
in
a
spirit
of
i
am
gratified
that
you
insert
the
last
clause
miss
scudder
i
might
not
otherwise
recognize
the
gentle
being
whom
i
have
always
regarded
as
the
impersonation
of
all
that
is
softest
in
woman
i
have
not
the
honour
of
understanding
in
the
least
the
reason
of
this
apparently
capricious
sentence
but
i
bow
to
it
in
mr
burr
said
mary
walking
up
to
him
and
looking
him
full
in
the
eyes
with
an
energy
that
for
the
moment
bore
down
his
practised
air
of
easy
superiority
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
for
a
moment
as
one
immortal
soul
should
to
another
without
any
of
those
false
glosses
and
deceits
which
men
call
ceremony
and
good
manners
you
have
done
a
very
great
injury
to
a
lovely
lady
whose
weakness
ought
to
have
been
sacred
in
your
eyes
precisely
because
you
are
what
you
are
keen
penetrating
able
to
control
and
govern
all
who
come
near
you
because
you
have
the
power
to
make
yourself
agreeable
interesting
fascinating
and
to
win
esteem
and
love
for
that
reason
you
ought
to
hold
yourself
the
guardian
of
every
woman
and
treat
her
as
you
would
wish
any
man
to
treat
your
own
daughter
i
leave
it
to
your
own
conscience
whether
this
is
the
manner
in
which
you
have
treated
madame
de
upon
my
word
miss
scudder
began
burr
i
can
not
imagine
what
representations
our
mutual
friend
may
have
been
making
i
assure
you
our
intercourse
has
been
as
irreproachable
as
the
most
scrupulous
could
irreproachable
innocent
burr
you
know
that
you
have
taken
the
very
life
out
of
her
you
men
can
have
everything
ambition
wealth
power
a
thousand
ways
are
open
to
you
and
women
have
nothing
but
their
hearts
and
when
that
is
gone
all
is
gone
burr
you
remember
the
rich
man
that
had
flocks
and
herds
but
nothing
would
do
for
him
but
he
must
have
the
one
little
ewe
lamb
which
was
all
his
poor
neighbour
had
thou
art
the
man
you
have
stolen
all
the
love
she
has
to
give
all
that
she
had
to
make
a
happy
home
and
you
can
never
give
her
anything
in
return
without
endangering
her
purity
and
her
soul
and
you
knew
you
could
not
i
know
you
men
this
is
a
light
matter
but
it
is
death
to
us
what
will
this
woman
s
life
be
one
long
struggle
to
forget
and
when
you
have
forgotten
her
and
are
going
on
gay
and
happy
when
you
have
thrown
her
very
name
away
as
a
faded
flower
she
will
be
praying
hoping
fearing
for
you
though
all
men
deny
you
yet
will
not
she
yes
burr
if
ever
your
popularity
and
prosperity
should
leave
you
and
those
who
now
flatter
should
despise
and
curse
you
she
will
always
be
interceding
with
her
own
heart
and
with
god
for
you
and
making
a
thousand
excuses
when
she
can
not
deny
and
if
you
die
as
i
fear
you
have
lived
unreconciled
to
the
god
of
your
fathers
it
will
be
in
her
heart
to
offer
up
her
very
soul
for
you
and
to
pray
that
god
will
impute
all
your
sins
to
her
and
give
you
heaven
oh
i
know
this
because
i
have
felt
it
in
my
own
heart
and
mary
threw
herself
passionately
down
into
a
chair
and
broke
into
an
agony
of
uncontrolled
sobbing
burr
turned
away
and
stood
looking
through
the
window
tears
were
dropping
silently
unchecked
by
the
cold
hard
pride
which
was
the
evil
demon
of
his
life
it
is
due
to
our
human
nature
to
believe
that
no
man
could
ever
have
been
so
passionately
and
enduringly
loved
and
revered
by
both
men
and
women
as
he
was
without
a
beautiful
and
lovable
nature
no
man
ever
demonstrated
more
forcibly
the
truth
that
it
is
not
a
man
s
natural
constitution
but
the
he
makes
of
it
which
stamps
him
as
good
or
evil
the
diviner
part
of
him
was
weeping
and
the
cold
proud
demon
was
struggling
to
regain
his
lost
ascendency
every
sob
of
the
fair
inspired
child
who
had
been
speaking
to
him
seemed
to
shake
his
heart
he
felt
as
if
he
could
have
fallen
on
his
knees
to
her
and
yet
that
stoical
habit
which
was
the
boast
of
his
life
which
was
the
highest
wisdom
he
taught
to
his
only
and
beautiful
daughter
was
slowly
stealing
back
round
his
heart
and
he
pressed
his
lips
together
resolved
that
no
word
should
escape
till
he
had
fully
mastered
himself
in
a
few
moments
mary
rose
with
renewed
calmness
and
dignity
and
approaching
him
said
before
i
wish
you
a
good
morning
burr
i
must
ask
pardon
for
the
liberty
i
have
taken
in
speaking
so
very
there
is
no
pardon
needed
my
dear
child
said
burr
turning
and
speaking
very
gently
and
with
a
face
expressive
of
a
softened
concern
if
you
have
told
me
harsh
truths
it
was
with
gentle
intentions
i
only
hope
that
i
may
prove
at
least
by
the
future
that
i
am
not
altogether
so
bad
as
you
imagine
as
to
the
friend
whose
name
has
been
passed
between
us
no
man
can
go
beyond
me
in
a
sense
of
her
real
nobleness
i
am
sensible
how
little
i
can
ever
deserve
the
sentiment
with
which
she
honours
me
i
am
ready
in
my
future
course
to
obey
any
commands
that
you
and
she
may
think
proper
to
lay
upon
the
only
kindness
you
can
now
do
her
said
mary
is
to
leave
her
it
is
impossible
that
you
can
be
merely
friends
is
impossible
without
violating
the
holiest
bonds
that
you
can
be
more
the
injury
done
is
irreparable
but
you
can
avoid
adding
another
and
greater
one
to
burr
looked
thoughtful
may
i
say
one
thing
more
said
mary
the
colour
rising
in
her
cheeks
burr
looked
at
her
with
that
smile
that
always
drew
out
the
confidence
of
every
heart
mr
burr
she
said
you
will
pardon
me
but
i
can
not
help
saying
this
you
have
i
am
told
wholly
renounced
the
christian
faith
of
your
fathers
and
build
your
whole
life
on
quite
another
foundation
i
can
not
help
feeling
that
this
is
a
great
and
terrible
mistake
i
can
not
help
wishing
that
you
would
examine
and
my
dear
child
i
am
extremely
grateful
to
you
for
your
remark
and
appreciate
fully
the
purity
of
the
source
from
which
it
springs
unfortunately
our
intellectual
beliefs
are
not
subject
to
the
control
of
our
will
i
have
examined
and
the
examination
has
i
regret
to
say
not
had
the
effect
you
would
mary
looked
at
him
wistfully
he
smiled
and
bowed
all
himself
again
and
stopping
at
the
door
he
said
with
a
proud
humility
do
me
the
favour
to
present
my
devoted
regard
to
your
friend
believe
me
that
hereafter
you
shall
have
less
reason
to
complain
of
he
bowed
and
was
gone
an
of
the
scene
has
related
that
when
burr
resigned
his
seat
as
president
of
his
country
s
senate
he
was
an
object
of
peculiar
political
bitterness
and
obloquy
almost
all
who
listened
to
him
had
made
up
their
minds
that
he
was
an
utterly
faithless
unprincipled
man
and
yet
such
was
his
singular
and
peculiar
personal
power
that
his
short
farewell
address
melted
the
whole
assembly
into
tears
and
his
most
embittered
adversaries
were
charmed
into
a
momentary
enthusiasm
of
admiration
it
must
not
be
wondered
at
therefore
if
our
loving
mary
strangely
found
all
her
indignation
against
him
gone
and
herself
little
disposed
to
criticise
the
impassioned
tenderness
with
which
madame
de
frontignac
still
regarded
him
we
have
one
thing
more
that
we
can
not
avoid
saying
of
two
men
so
singularly
in
juxtaposition
as
aaron
burr
and
hopkins
both
had
a
perfect
of
life
and
guided
themselves
with
an
inflexible
rigidity
by
it
burr
assumed
individual
pleasure
to
be
the
great
object
of
human
existence
and
hopkins
placed
it
in
a
life
altogether
beyond
self
burr
rejected
all
sacrifice
hopkins
considered
sacrifice
as
the
foundation
of
all
existence
to
live
as
far
as
possible
without
a
disagreeable
sensation
was
an
object
which
burr
proposed
to
himself
as
the
for
which
he
drilled
down
and
subjugated
a
nature
of
singular
richness
hopkins
on
the
other
hand
smoothed
the
asperities

chère
said
madame
de
frontignac
when
mary
came
out
of
the
room
with
her
cheeks
glowing
and
her
eyes
flashing
with
a
still
unsubdued
light
voilà
encore
what
did
he
say
did
he
ask
for
me
yes
said
mary
he
asked
for
what
did
you
tell
him
i
told
him
that
you
wished
me
to
excuse
how
did
he
look
then
did
he
look
surprised
a
good
deal
so
i
thought
said
mary
tell
me
all
you
said
and
all
he
oh
said
mary
i
am
the
worst
person
in
the
world
in
fact
i
can
not
remember
anything
that
i
have
said
but
i
told
him
that
he
must
leave
you
and
never
see
you
any
oh
never
madame
de
frontignac
sat
down
on
the
side
of
the
bed
with
such
a
look
of
utter
despair
as
went
to
mary
s
heart
you
know
that
that
is
best
verginie
do
you
not
oh
yes
i
know
it
but
it
is
like
death
to
me
ah
well
what
shall
verginie
do
now
you
have
your
husband
said
mary
i
do
not
love
him
said
madame
de
frontignac
yes
but
he
is
a
good
and
honourable
man
and
you
should
love
love
is
not
in
our
power
said
madame
de
frontignac
not
of
love
said
mary
but
kinds
if
you
have
an
indulgent
friend
who
protects
you
and
cares
for
you
you
can
be
grateful
to
him
you
can
try
to
make
him
happy
and
in
time
you
may
come
to
love
him
very
much
he
is
a
thousand
times
nobler
man
if
what
you
say
is
true
than
the
one
who
has
injured
you
oh
mary
said
madame
de
frontignac
there
are
some
cases
where
we
find
it
too
easy
to
love
our
more
than
that
said
mary
i
believe
that
if
you
were
to
go
on
patiently
in
the
way
of
duty
and
pray
daily
to
god
that
at
last
he
will
take
out
of
your
heart
this
painful
love
and
give
you
a
true
and
healthy
one
as
you
say
such
feelings
are
very
sweet
and
noble
but
they
are
not
the
only
ones
we
have
to
live
by
we
can
find
happiness
in
duty
in
in
calm
sincere
honest
friendship
that
is
what
you
can
feel
for
your
your
words
cool
me
said
madame
de
frontignac
thou
art
a
sweet
and
my
heart
is
hot
and
tired
i
like
to
feel
thee
in
my
arms
she
said
putting
her
arms
around
mary
and
resting
her
head
upon
her
shoulder
talk
to
me
so
every
day
and
read
me
good
cool
verses
out
of
that
beautiful
book
and
perhaps
i
shall
grow
still
and
quiet
like
thus
mary
soothed
her
friend
but
every
few
days
this
soothing
had
to
be
done
over
as
long
as
burr
remained
in
newport
when
he
was
finally
gone
she
grew
more
calm
the
simple
homely
ways
of
the
cottage
the
healthful
routine
of
daily
domestic
toils
into
which
she
delighted
to
enter
brought
refreshment
to
her
spirits
that
fine
tact
and
exquisite
social
sympathy
which
distinguishes
the
french
above
other
nations
caused
her
at
once
to
enter
into
the
spirit
of
the
life
in
which
she
moved
so
that
she
no
longer
shocked
any
one
s
religious
feelings
by
acts
forbidden
to
the
puritan
idea
of
the
sabbath
or
failed
in
any
of
the
exterior
proprieties
of
religious
life
she
also
read
and
studied
with
avidity
the
english
bible
which
came
to
her
with
the
novelty
of
a
wholly
new
book
and
in
a
new
language
nor
was
she
without
a
certain
artistic
valuation
of
the
austere
precision
and
gravity
of
the
religious
life
by
which
she
was
surrounded
it
is
sublime
but
a
little
glaciale
like
the
alps
she
sometimes
said
to
mary
and
marvyn
when
speaking
of
it
but
then
she
added
playfully
there
are
the
roses
des
and
the
air
is
very
strengthening
and
it
is
near
to
faut
we
have
shown
how
she
appeared
to
the
eye
of
new
england
life
it
may
not
be
uninteresting
to
give
a
letter
to
one
of
her
friends
which
showed
how
the
same
appeared
to
her
it
was
not
a
friend
with
whom
she
felt
on
such
terms
that
her
intimacy
with
burr
would
furnish
any
allusions
to
her
correspondence
you
behold
me
my
charming
gabrielle
quite
pastoral
recruiting
from
the
dissipations
of
my
philadelphia
life
in
a
lovely
quiet
cottage
with
most
worthy
excellent
people
whom
i
have
learnt
to
love
very
much
they
are
good
and
true
as
pious
as
the
saints
themselves
although
they
do
not
belong
to
the
true
church
a
thing
which
i
am
sorry
for
but
then
let
us
hope
that
if
the
world
is
wide
heaven
is
wider
and
that
all
worthy
and
religious
people
will
find
room
at
last
this
is
verginie
s
own
little
pet
private
heresy
and
when
i
tell
it
to
the
abbé
he
only
smiles
and
so
i
think
somehow
that
it
is
not
so
very
bad
as
it
might
be
we
have
had
a
very
gay
life
in
philadelphia
and
now
i
am
growing
tired
of
the
world
and
think
i
shall
retire
to
my
cheese
like
la
fontaine
s
rat
these
people
in
the
country
here
in
america
have
a
character
quite
their
own
very
different
from
the
life
of
cities
where
one
sees
for
the
most
part
only
a
continuation
of
the
forms
of
good
society
which
exist
in
the
old
world
in
the
country
these
people
seem
simple
grave
severe
always
industrious
cold
and
reserved
in
their
manners
towards
each
other
but
with
great
warmth
of
heart
they
are
all
obedient
to
the
word
of
their
priest
whom
they
call
a
minister
and
who
lives
among
them
just
like
any
other
man
and
marries
and
has
children
everything
in
their
worship
is
plain
and
austere
their
churches
are
perfectly
desolate
they
have
no
chants
no
pictures
no
carvings
only
a
most
disconsolate
bare
building
where
they
meet
together
and
sing
one
or
two
hymns
and
the
minister
makes
one
or
two
prayers
all
out
of
his
own
thoughts
and
then
gives
them
a
long
long
discourse
about
things
which
i
can
not
understand
english
enough
to
comprehend
there
is
a
very
beautiful
charming
young
girl
here
the
daughter
of
my
hostess
who
is
as
lovely
and
as
saintly
as
catharine
and
has
such
a
genius
for
religion
that
if
she
had
been
in
our
church
she
would
certainly
have
made
a
saint
her
mother
is
a
respectable
and
worthy
matron
and
the
good
priest
lives
in
the
family
i
think
he
is
a
man
of
very
sublime
religion
as
much
above
this
world
as
a
great
mountain
but
he
has
the
true
sense
of
liberty
and
fraternity
for
he
has
dared
to
oppose
with
all
his
might
this
detestable
and
cruel
trade
in
poor
negroes
which
makes
us
who
are
so
proud
of
the
example
of
america
in
asserting
the
rights
of
man
so
ashamed
for
her
inconsistencies
well
now
there
is
a
little
romance
getting
up
in
the
cottage
for
the
good
priest
has
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
pretty
saint
and
has
discovered
what
he
must
be
blind
not
to
see
that
she
is
very
lovely
and
so
as
he
can
marry
he
wants
to
make
her
his
wife
and
her
mamma
who
adores
him
as
if
he
were
god
is
quite
set
upon
it
the
sweet
marie
however
has
had
a
lover
of
her
own
in
her
little
heart
a
beautiful
young
man
who
went
to
sea
as
heroes
always
do
to
seek
his
fortune
and
the
cruel
sea
has
drowned
him
and
the
poor
little
saint
has
wept
and
prayed
her
very
life
out
on
his
grave
till
she
is
so
thin
and
sweet
and
mournful
that
it
makes
one
s
heart
ache
to
see
her
smile
in
our
church
gabrielle
she
would
have
gone
into
a
convent
but
she
makes
a
vocation
of
her
daily
life
and
goes
round
the
house
so
sweetly
doing
all
the
little
work
that
is
to
be
done
as
sacredly
as
the
nuns
pray
at
the
altar
for
you
must
know
here
in
new
england
the
people
for
the
most
part
keep
no
servants
but
perform
all
the
household
work
themselves
with
no
end
of
spinning
and
sewing
besides
it
is
the
true
arcadia
where
you
find
refined
and
cultivated
natures
busying
themselves
with
the
simplest
toils
for
these
people
are
and
and
truly
ladies
in
all
things
and
so
my
little
marie
and
i
we
feed
the
hens
and
chickens
together
and
we
search
for
eggs
in
the
hay
in
the
barn
and
they
have
taught
me
to
spin
at
their
great
wheel
and
a
little
one
too
which
makes
a
noise
like
the
humming
of
a
bee
but
where
am
i
oh
i
was
telling
about
the
romance
well
so
the
good
priest
has
proposed
for
my
marie
and
the
dear
soul
has
accepted
him
as
the
nun
accepts
the
veil
for
she
only
loves
him
filially
and
religiously
and
now
they
are
going
on
in
their
way
with
preparations
for
the
wedding
they
had
what
they
call
a
quilting
here
the
other
night
to
prepare
the
bride
s
quilt
and
all
the
friends
in
the
neighbourhood
was
very
amusing
to
see
the
morals
of
this
people
are
so
austere
that
young
men
and
girls
are
allowed
the
greatest
freedom
they
associate
and
talk
freely
together
and
the
young
men
walk
home
alone
with
the
girls
after
evening
parties
and
most
generally
the
young
people
i
am
told
arrange
their
marriages
among
themselves
before
the
consent
of
the
parents
is
asked
this
is
very
strange
to
us
i
must
not
weary
you
however
with
the
details
i
watch
my
little
romance
daily
and
will
let
you
hear
further
as
it
progresses
with
a
thousand
kisses
i
am
ever
your
loving
chapter
xxxiv
meanwhile
wedding
proceedings
were
going
on
at
the
cottage
with
that
consistent
vigour
with
which
yankee
people
always
drive
operations
when
they
know
precisely
what
they
are
about
the
was
definitively
fixed
for
the
of
august
and
every
one
of
the
two
weeks
between
had
its
particular
significance
and
value
precisely
marked
out
and
arranged
in
katy
scudder
s
comprehensive
and
systematic
schemes
it
was
settled
that
the
pair
were
for
a
while
at
least
to
reside
at
the
cottage
it
might
have
been
imagined
therefore
that
no
great
external
changes
were
in
contemplation
but
it
is
astonishing
to
see
the
amount
of
grave
discussion
the
amount
of
consulting
advising
and
running
abstractedly
to
and
fro
which
can
be
made
to
result
out
of
an
apparently
slight
change
in
the
relative
position
of
two
people
in
the
same
house
hopkins
really
opened
his
eyes
with
calm
modest
soul
he
had
never
imagined
himself
the
hero
of
so
much
preparation
he
heard
his
name
constantly
from
morning
to
night
occurring
in
busy
consultations
that
seemed
to
be
going
on
between
miss
prissy
and
deacon
twitchel
and
scudder
and
jones
and
quietly
wondered
what
they
could
have
so
much
more
than
usual
to
say
about
him
for
a
while
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
whole
house
was
about
to
be
torn
to
pieces
he
was
even
requested
to
step
out
of
his
study
one
day
into
which
immediately
entered
in
his
absence
two
of
the
most
vigorous
women
of
the
parish
who
proceeded
to
uttermost
measures
first
pitching
everything
into
pie
so
that
the
doctor
who
returned
disconsolately
to
look
for
a
book
at
once
gave
up
himself
and
his
system
of
divinity
as
entirely
lost
until
assured
by
one
of
the
ladies
in
a
condescending
manner
that
he
knew
nothing
about
the
matter
and
that
if
he
would
return
after
half
a
day
he
would
find
everything
right
again
a
declaration
in
which
he
tried
to
have
unlimited
faith
and
where
he
found
the
advantage
of
a
mind
accustomed
to
believe
in
mysteries
and
it
is
to
be
remarked
that
on
his
return
he
actually
found
his
table
in
most
perfect
order
with
not
a
single
one
of
his
papers
missing
in
fact
to
his
ignorant
eye
the
room
looked
exactly
as
it
did
before
and
when
miss
prissy
eloquently
demonstrated
to
him
that
every
inch
of
that
paint
had
been
scrubbed
and
the
windows
taken
out
and
washed
inside
and
out
and
rinsed
through
three
waters
and
that
the
curtains
had
been
taken
down
and
washed
and
put
through
a
blue
water
and
starched
and
ironed
and
put
up
again
he
only
innocently
wondered
in
his
ignorance
what
there
was
in
a
man
s
being
married
that
made
all
these
ceremonies
necessary
but
the
doctor
was
a
wise
man
and
in
cases
of
difficulty
kept
his
mind
much
to
himself
and
therefore
he
only
informed
those
energetic
practitioners
that
he
was
extremely
obliged
to
them
accepting
the
matter
by
simple
faith
an
example
which
we
recommend
to
all
good
men
in
similar
circumstances
the
house
throughout
was
subjected
to
similar
renovations
everything
in
every
chest
or
trunk
or
box
was
vigorously
pulled
out
and
hung
out
on
lines
in
the
to
air
for
when
once
the
spirit
of
enterprise
has
fairly
possessed
a
group
of
women
it
assumes
the
form
of
a
prophetic
fury
and
carries
them
beyond
themselves
let
not
any
ignorant
mortal
of
the
masculine
gender
at
such
hours
rashly
dare
to
question
the
promptings
of
the
genius
that
inspires
them
spite
of
all
the
treatises
that
have
lately
appeared
to
demonstrate
that
there
is
no
particular
inherent
diversity
between
men
and
women
we
hold
to
the
opinion
that
one
thorough
season
of
is
sufficient
to
demonstrate
the
existence
of
awful
and
mysterious
differences
between
the
sexes
and
of
subtle
and
reserved
forces
in
the
female
line
before
which
the
lords
of
creation
can
only
veil
their
faces
with
a
discreet
reverence
as
our
doctor
has
done
in
fact
his
whole
deportment
on
the
occasion
was
characterized
by
humility
so
edifying
as
really
to
touch
the
hearts
of
the
whole
synod
of
matrons
and
miss
prissy
rewarded
him
by
declaring
impressively
her
opinion
that
he
was
worthy
to
have
a
voice
in
the
choosing
the
and
she
actually
swooped
him
up
just
in
a
very
critical
part
of
a
distinction
between
natural
and
moral
ability
and
conveyed
him
bodily
as
fairy
sprites
know
how
to
convey
the
most
ponderous
of
mortals
into
the
best
room
where
three
specimens
of
brocade
lay
spread
out
upon
a
table
for
inspection
mary
stood
by
the
side
of
the
table
her
pretty
head
bent
reflectively
downward
her
cheek
just
resting
upon
the
tip
of
one
of
her
fingers
as
she
stood
looking
thoughtfully
the
brocades
at
something
deeper
that
seemed
to
lie
under
them
and
when
the
doctor
was
required
to
give
judgment
on
the
articles
it
was
observed
by
the
matrons
that
his
large
blue
eyes
were
resting
upon
mary
with
an
expression
that
almost
glorified
his
face
and
it
was
not
until
his
elbow
was
repeatedly
shaken
by
miss
prissy
that
he
gave
a
sudden
start
and
fixed
his
attention
as
was
requested
upon
the
silks
it
had
been
one
of
miss
prissy
s
favourite
theories
that
that
dear
blessed
man
taste
enough
if
he
would
only
give
his
mind
to
and
in
fact
the
doctor
rather
verified
the
remark
on
the
present
occasion
for
he
looked
very
conscientiously
and
soberly
at
the
silks
and
even
handled
them
cautiously
and
respectfully
with
his
fingers
and
listened
with
grave
attention
to
all
that
miss
prissy
told
him
of
their
price
and
properties
and
then
laid
his
finger
down
on
one
whose
ground
was
embellished
with
a
pattern
representing
lilies
of
the
valley
on
a
background
of
green
leaves
this
is
the
one
he
said
with
an
air
of
decision
and
then
he
looked
at
mary
and
smiled
and
a
murmur
of
universal
approbation
broke
out
a
chorus
of
loud
acclamations
in
which
miss
prissy
s
voice
took
the
lead
conveyed
to
the
doctor
the
idea
that
in
some
mysterious
way
he
had
distinguished
himself
in
the
eyes
of
his
feminine
friends
whereat
he
retired
to
his
study
slightly
marvelling
but
on
the
whole
well
pleased
as
men
generally
are
when
they
do
better
than
they
expect
and
miss
prissy
turning
out
all
profaner
persons
from
the
apartment
held
a
solemn
consultation
to
which
only
mary
scudder
and
madame
de
frontignac
were
admitted
for
it
is
to
be
observed
that
the
latter
had
risen
daily
and
hourly
in
miss
prissy
s
esteem
since
her
entrance
into
the
cottage
and
she
declared
that
if
she
only
would
give
her
a
few
hints
she
didn
t
believe
but
that
she
could
make
that
dress
look
just
like
a
paris
one
and
rather
intimated
that
in
such
a
case
she
might
almost
be
ready
to
resign
all
mortal
ambitions
the
afternoon
of
this
day
just
at
that
cool
hour
when
the
clock
ticks
so
quietly
in
a
new
england
kitchen
and
everything
is
so
clean
and
put
away
that
there
seems
to
be
nothing
to
do
in
the
house
mary
sat
quietly
down
in
her
room
to
hem
a
ruffle
everybody
had
gone
out
of
the
house
on
various
errands
the
doctor
with
implicit
faith
had
surrendered
himself
to
scudder
and
miss
prissy
to
be
conveyed
up
to
newport
and
attend
to
various
appointments
in
relation
to
his
outer
man
which
he
was
informed
would
be
indispensable
in
the
forthcoming
solemnities
madame
de
frontignac
had
also
gone
to
spend
the
day
with
some
of
her
newport
friends
and
mary
quite
well
pleased
with
the
placid
and
orderly
stillness
which
reigned
through
the
house
sat
pleasantly
murmuring
a
little
tune
to
her
sewing
when
suddenly
the
trip
of
a
merry
brisk
foot
was
heard
in
the
kitchen
and
miss
cerinthy
ann
twitchel
made
her
appearance
at
the
door
her
healthy
glowing
cheek
wearing
a
still
brighter
colour
from
the
exercise
of
a
walk
in
a
july
day
why
cerinthy
said
mary
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
well
said
cerinthy
i
have
been
meaning
to
come
down
all
this
week
but
there
is
so
much
to
do
in
but
i
told
mother
i
come
i
brought
these
down
she
said
unfolding
a
dozen
of
snowy
damask
napkins
that
i
spun
myself
and
was
thinking
of
you
almost
all
the
while
i
spun
them
so
i
suppose
they
ain
t
quite
so
wicked
as
they
might
we
will
remark
here
that
cerinthy
ann
in
virtue
of
having
a
high
stock
of
animal
spirits
and
great
fulness
of
physical
vigour
had
very
small
proclivities
towards
the
unseen
and
spiritual
but
still
always
indulged
a
secret
resentment
at
being
classed
as
a
sinner
above
many
others
who
as
made
such
professions
and
were
as
she
remarked
not
a
bit
better
than
she
she
always
however
had
cherished
an
unbounded
veneration
for
mary
and
had
made
her
the
confidante
of
most
of
her
important
secrets
and
it
soon
became
very
evident
that
she
had
come
with
one
on
her
mind
now
don
t
you
want
to
come
and
sit
out
in
the
lot
she
said
to
her
after
sitting
awhile
twirling
her
with
the
air
of
one
who
has
something
to
say
and
does
not
know
exactly
how
to
begin
upon
it
mary
cheerfully
gathered
up
her
thread
scissors
and
ruffling
and
the
two
stepped
over
the
and
soon
found
themselves
seated
cozily
under
the
boughs
of
a
large
whose
descending
branches
meeting
the
tops
of
the
high
grass
all
around
formed
a
perfect
seclusion
as
private
as
heart
could
desire
they
sat
down
pushing
away
a
place
in
the
grass
and
cerinthy
ann
took
off
her
bonnet
and
threw
it
among
the
clover
exhibiting
to
view
her
glossy
black
hair
always
trimly
arranged
in
shining
braids
except
where
some
curls
fell
over
the
rich
high
colour
of
her
cheeks
something
appeared
to
discompose
her
this
afternoon
there
were
those
evident
signs
of
a
consultation
impending
which
to
an
experienced
eye
are
as
unmistakeable
as
the
coming
up
of
a
shower
in
summer
cerinthy
began
by
passionately
demolishing
several
heads
of
clover
remarking
as
she
did
so
that
she
didn
t
see
for
her
part
how
mary
could
keep
so
calm
when
things
were
coming
so
near
and
as
mary
answered
to
this
only
with
a
quiet
smile
she
broke
out
again
i
don
t
see
for
my
part
how
a
young
girl
marry
a
minister
anyhow
but
then
i
think
are
just
cut
out
for
it
but
what
would
anybody
say
if
should
do
such
a
thing
i
don
t
know
said
mary
innocently
well
i
suppose
everybody
would
hold
up
their
hands
and
yet
if
i
say
it
myself
she
added
colouring
there
are
not
many
girls
who
could
make
a
better
minister
s
wife
than
i
could
if
i
had
a
mind
to
that
i
am
sure
of
said
mary
warmly
i
guess
you
are
the
only
one
that
ever
thought
so
said
cerinthy
giving
an
impatient
toss
there
s
father
all
the
while
mourning
over
me
and
mother
too
and
yet
i
don
t
see
but
that
i
do
pretty
much
all
that
is
done
in
the
house
and
they
say
i
am
a
great
comfort
in
a
temporal
point
of
view
but
oh
the
groanings
and
the
sighings
that
there
are
over
me
i
don
t
think
it
is
pleasant
to
think
that
your
best
friends
are
thinking
such
awful
things
about
you
when
you
are
working
your
fingers
off
to
help
them
it
is
kind
o
discouraging
but
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
about
it
and
for
a
few
moments
cerinthy
sat
demolishing
buttercups
and
throwing
them
up
in
the
air
till
her
shiny
black
head
was
covered
with
golden
flakes
while
her
cheek
grew
redder
with
something
that
she
was
going
to
say
next
now
mary
there
is
won
t
take
no
for
an
answer
what
shall
i
do
suppose
then
you
try
yes
said
mary
rather
archly
oh
pshaw
mary
scudder
you
know
better
than
that
now
i
look
like
it
don
t
i
why
yes
said
mary
looking
at
cerinthy
deliberately
on
the
whole
i
think
you
well
one
thing
i
must
say
said
cerinthy
i
can
t
see
what
finds
in
me
i
think
he
is
a
thousand
times
too
good
for
me
why
you
have
no
idea
mary
how
i
plagued
him
i
believe
that
man
is
a
she
added
while
something
like
a
penitent
tear
actually
glistened
in
those
sharp
saucy
black
eyes
besides
she
added
i
have
told
him
everything
i
could
think
of
to
discourage
him
i
told
him
that
i
had
a
bad
temper
and
didn
t
believe
the
doctrines
and
couldn
t
promise
that
i
ever
should
and
after
all
that
creature
keeps
right
on
and
i
don
t
know
what
to
tell
well
said
mary
mildly
do
you
think
you
really
love
him
love
him
said
cerinthy
giving
a
great
flounce
to
be
sure
i
don
me
loving
man
i
told
him
last
night
i
didn
t
but
it
didn
t
do
a
bit
of
good
i
used
to
think
that
man
was
bashful
but
i
declare
i
have
altered
my
mind
he
will
talk
and
talk
till
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
i
tell
you
mary
he
talks
beautifully
too
here
cerinthy
turned
quickly
away
and
began
reaching
passionately
after
clover
heads
after
a
few
moments
she
resumed
the
fact
is
mary
that
man
somebody
to
take
care
of
him
for
he
never
thinks
of
himself
they
say
he
has
got
the
consumption
but
he
hasn
t
any
more
than
i
have
it
is
just
the
way
he
neglects
himself
talking
and
to
take
care
of
him
and
see
to
his
clothes
and
nurse
him
up
when
he
gets
a
little
hoarse
and
run
down
well
i
suppose
if
i
unregenerate
i
do
know
how
to
keep
things
in
order
and
if
i
should
keep
a
man
s
soul
in
his
body
i
suppose
i
should
be
doing
some
good
in
the
world
because
if
a
minister
don
t
of
course
he
can
t
convert
anybody
just
think
of
his
saying
that
i
could
be
a
comfort
to
i
told
him
that
it
was
perfectly
ridiculous
and
besides
says
i
what
will
everybody
think
i
thought
that
i
had
really
talked
him
out
of
the
notion
of
it
last
night
but
there
he
was
in
again
this
morning
and
told
me
he
had
derived
great
encouragement
from
what
i
said
well
the
poor
man
really
is
lonesome
his
mother
s
dead
and
he
hasn
t
any
sisters
i
asked
him
why
he
didn
t
go
and
take
miss
olladine
hocum
everybody
says
she
would
make
a
minister
s
well
and
what
did
he
say
to
that
said
mary
well
something
really
silly
about
my
looks
said
cerinthy
looking
down
mary
looked
up
and
remarked
the
shining
black
hair
the
long
dark
lashes
lying
down
over
the
glowing
cheek
where
two
arch
dimples
were
nestling
and
said
quietly
probably
he
is
a
man
of
taste
cerinthy
i
advise
you
to
leave
the
matter
entirely
to
his
you
don
t
really
mary
said
the
damsel
looking
up
don
t
you
think
it
would
injure
if
i
should
i
think
not
materially
said
mary
well
said
cerinthy
rising
the
men
will
be
coming
home
from
mowing
before
i
get
home
and
want
their
supper
mother
has
one
of
her
headaches
on
this
afternoon
so
i
can
t
stop
any
longer
there
isn
t
a
soul
in
the
house
knows
where
anything
is
when
i
am
gone
if
i
should
ever
take
it
into
my
head
to
go
off
i
don
t
know
what
would
become
of
father
and
mother
i
was
telling
mother
the
other
day
that
i
thought
unregenerate
folks
were
of
some
use
in
world
any
does
your
mother
know
anything
about
it
said
mary
oh
as
to
mother
i
believe
she
has
been
hoping
and
praying
about
it
these
three
months
she
thinks
that
i
am
such
a
desperate
case
it
is
the
only
way
i
am
to
be
brought
in
as
she
calls
it
that
s
what
set
me
against
him
at
first
but
the
fact
is
if
girls
will
let
a
man
argue
with
them
he
always
contrives
to
get
the
best
of
it
i
am
provoked
about
it
too
but
dear
me
he
is
so
meek
there
is
no
use
of
getting
provoked
at
him
well
i
guess
i
will
go
home
and
think
about
as
she
turned
to
go
she
looked
really
pretty
her
long
lashes
were
wet
with
a
twinkling
moisture
like
after
a
shower
and
there
was
a
softened
expression
stealing
over
the
careless
gaiety
of
her
face
mary
put
her
arms
round
her
with
a
gentle
caressing
movement
which
the
other
returned
with
a
hearty
embrace
they
stood
locked
in
each
other
s
arms
the
bright
vigorous
girl
with
that
pale
spiritual
face
resting
on
her
breast
as
when
the
morning
songful
and
radiant
clasps
the
pale
silver
moon
to
her
glowing
bosom
look
here
now
mary
said
cerinthy
your
folks
are
all
gone
you
may
as
well
walk
with
me
it
s
pleasant
yes
i
will
said
mary
wait
a
moment
till
i
get
my
in
a
few
moments
the
two
girls
were
walking
together
in
one
of
those
little
pasture
which
run
cosily
among
huckleberry
and
juniper
bushes
while
cerinthy
eagerly
pursued
the
subject
she
could
not
leave
thinking
of
their
path
now
wound
over
high
ground
that
overlooked
the
distant
sea
now
lost
itself
in
little
copses
of
cedar
and
and
now
there
came
on
the
air
the
pleasant
breath
of
new
hay
which
mowers
were
harvesting
in
adjoining
meadows
they
walked
on
and
on
as
girls
will
because
when
a
young
lady
has
once
fairly
launched
on
the
enterprise
of
telling
another
all
that
said
and
just
how
looked
for
the
last
three
months
walks
are
apt
to
be
indefinitely
extended
mary
was
besides
one
of
the
most
seductive
little
confidantes
in
the
world
she
was
so
pure
from
all
so
heartily
and
innocently
interested
in
what
another
was
telling
her
that
people
in
talking
with
her
found
the
subject
constantly
increasing
in
interest
although
if
they
had
really
been
called
upon
afterwards
to
state
the
exact
portion
in
which
she
added
to
the
conversation
they
would
have
been
surprised
to
find
it
so
small
in
fact
before
cerinthy
ann
had
quite
finished
her
confessions
they
were
more
than
a
mile
from
the
cottage
and
mary
began
to
think
of
returning
saying
that
her
mother
would
wonder
where
she
was
when
she
came
home
chapter
xxxv
the
sun
was
just
setting
and
the
whole
air
and
sea
seemed
flooded
with
rosy
rays
even
the
crags
and
rocks
of
the
took
purple
and
lilac
tints
and
savins
and
junipers
had
a
painter
been
required
to
represent
them
would
have
been
found
not
without
a
suffusion
of
the
same
tints
through
the
tremulous
rosy
sea
of
the
upper
air
the
silver
full
moon
looked
out
like
some
calm
superior
presence
which
waits
only
for
the
flush
of
a
temporary
excitement
to
die
away
to
make
its
tranquillizing
influence
felt
mary
as
she
walked
homeward
with
this
dreamy
light
about
her
moved
with
a
slower
step
than
when
borne
along
by
the
vigorous
arm
and
determined
motion
of
her
young
friend
it
is
said
that
a
musical
sound
uttered
with
decision
by
one
instrument
always
makes
vibrate
the
corresponding
chord
of
another
and
mary
felt
as
she
left
her
positive
but
friend
a
plaintive
vibration
of
something
in
her
own
self
of
which
she
was
conscious
her
calm
friendship
for
her
future
husband
had
no
part
she
fell
into
one
of
those
reveries
which
she
thought
she
had
for
ever
forbidden
to
herself
and
there
arose
before
her
mind
like
a
picture
the
idea
of
a
marriage
ceremony
but
the
eyes
of
the
bridegroom
were
dark
and
his
curls
were
clustering
in
raven
ringlets
and
her
hand
throbbed
in
his
as
it
had
never
throbbed
in
any
other
it
was
just
as
she
was
coming
out
of
a
little
grove
of
cedars
where
the
high
land
overlooks
the
sea
and
the
dream
which
came
to
her
overcame
her
with
a
vague
and
yearning
sense
of
pain
suddenly
she
heard
footsteps
behind
her
and
some
one
said
mary
it
was
spoken
in
a
choked
voice
as
one
speaks
in
the
crisis
of
a
great
emotion
and
she
turned
and
saw
those
very
eyes
very
hair
and
the
cold
little
hand
throbbed
with
that
very
throb
in
that
strong
living
manly
hand
and
whether
in
the
body
or
out
of
the
body
she
knew
not
she
felt
herself
borne
in
those
arms
and
words
that
spoke
themselves
in
her
inner
profaned
by
being
repeated
were
on
her
ear
oh
is
this
a
dream
it
a
dream
james
are
we
in
heaven
oh
i
have
lived
through
such
an
have
been
so
worn
out
oh
i
thought
you
never
would
come
and
then
the
eyes
closed
and
heaven
and
earth
faded
away
together
in
a
trance
of
blissful
rest
but
it
was
no
dream
for
an
hour
later
you
might
have
seen
a
manly
form
sitting
in
that
place
bearing
in
his
arms
a
pale
girl
whom
he
cherished
as
tenderly
as
a
mother
her
babe
and
they
were
talking
in
low
tones
and
in
all
this
wide
universe
neither
of
them
knew
or
felt
anything
but
the
great
joy
of
being
thus
side
by
side
they
spoke
of
love
mightier
than
death
which
many
waters
can
not
quench
they
spoke
of
yearnings
each
for
the
longing
hopes
then
of
this
great
joy
for
had
hardly
yet
returned
to
the
visible
world
scarce
wakened
from
deadly
faintness
she
had
not
come
back
fully
to
the
realm
of
life
to
that
of
love
and
therefore
it
was
that
without
knowing
that
she
spoke
she
had
said
all
and
compressed
the
history
of
those
three
years
into
one
hour
but
at
last
thoughtful
for
her
health
and
provident
of
her
weakness
he
rose
up
and
passed
his
arm
around
her
to
convey
her
home
and
as
he
did
so
he
spoke
word
that
broke
the
whole
charm
you
will
allow
me
mary
the
right
of
a
future
husband
to
watch
over
your
life
and
health
then
came
back
the
visible
consciousness
and
the
great
battle
of
duty
and
mary
drew
away
a
little
and
oh
james
you
are
too
late
can
never
be
he
drew
back
from
her
mary
are
you
married
before
god
i
am
she
said
my
word
is
pledged
i
can
not
retract
it
i
have
suffered
a
good
man
to
place
his
whole
faith
upon
man
who
loves
me
with
his
whole
soul
but
mary
you
do
not
love
is
impossible
said
james
holding
her
off
from
him
and
looking
at
her
with
an
agonized
eagerness
after
what
you
have
just
said
it
is
not
oh
james
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
what
i
have
said
it
was
all
so
sudden
and
i
didn
t
know
what
i
was
things
that
i
must
never
say
again
the
day
is
fixed
for
next
week
it
is
all
the
same
as
if
you
had
found
me
his
wife
not
quite
said
james
his
voice
cutting
the
air
with
a
decided
manly
ring
have
some
words
to
say
to
that
oh
james
will
you
be
selfish
will
tempt
me
to
do
a
mean
dishonourable
be
false
to
my
word
deliberately
given
but
said
james
eagerly
you
know
mary
you
would
have
given
it
if
you
had
known
that
i
was
that
is
true
james
but
i
give
it
i
have
suffered
him
to
build
all
his
hopes
of
life
upon
it
i
you
not
to
tempt
me
help
me
to
do
but
mary
did
you
not
get
my
letter
your
letter
yes
that
long
letter
that
i
wrote
i
never
got
any
letter
strange
he
said
no
wonder
it
seems
sudden
to
have
you
seen
your
mother
said
mary
who
was
conscious
this
moment
only
of
a
dizzy
instinct
to
turn
the
conversation
from
the
spot
where
she
felt
too
weak
to
bear
it
no
do
you
suppose
i
should
see
anybody
before
you
oh
then
you
must
go
to
her
said
mary
oh
james
you
don
t
know
how
she
has
suffered
they
were
drawing
near
to
the
cottage
gate
do
pray
said
mary
to
your
t
be
too
sudden
either
for
she
s
very
weak
she
is
almost
worn
out
with
sorrow
go
my
dear
brother
you
always
will
be
to
me
james
helped
her
into
the
house
and
they
parted
all
the
house
was
yet
still
the
open
kitchen
door
let
in
a
sober
square
of
moonlight
on
the
floor
the
very
stir
of
the
leaves
in
the
trees
could
be
heard
mary
went
into
her
little
room
and
threw
herself
upon
the
bed
weak
weary
yet
happy
for
deeper
and
higher
above
all
other
feelings
was
the
great
relief
that
was
living
still
after
a
little
while
she
heard
the
rattling
of
the
waggon
and
then
the
quick
patter
of
miss
prissy
s
feet
and
her
mother
s
considerate
tones
and
the
doctor
s
grave
voice
and
quite
unexpectedly
to
herself
she
was
shocked
to
find
herself
turning
with
an
inward
shudder
from
the
idea
of
meeting
him
how
very
wicked
she
thought
how
ungrateful
and
she
prayed
that
god
would
give
her
strength
to
check
the
first
rising
of
such
feelings
then
there
was
her
mother
so
ignorant
and
innocent
busy
putting
away
baskets
of
things
that
she
had
bought
in
provision
for
the
mary
almost
felt
as
if
she
had
a
guilty
secret
but
when
she
looked
back
upon
the
last
two
hours
she
felt
no
wish
to
take
them
back
two
little
hours
of
joy
and
rest
they
had
been
so
pure
so
perfect
she
thought
god
must
have
given
them
to
her
as
a
keepsake
to
remind
her
of
his
love
and
to
strengthen
her
in
the
way
of
duty
some
will
perhaps
think
it
an
unnatural
thing
that
mary
should
have
regarded
her
pledge
to
the
doctor
as
of
so
absolute
and
binding
a
force
but
they
must
remember
the
rigidity
of
her
education
and
had
been
the
daily
bread
of
her
life
every
prayer
hymn
and
sermon
from
her
childhood
had
warned
her
to
distrust
her
inclinations
and
regard
her
feelings
as
traitors
in
particular
had
she
been
brought
up
within
a
superstitious
tenacity
in
regard
to
the
sacredness
of
a
promise
and
in
this
case
the
promise
involved
so
deeply
the
happiness
of
a
friend
whom
she
had
loved
and
revered
all
her
life
that
she
never
thought
of
any
way
of
escape
from
it
she
had
been
taught
that
there
was
no
feeling
so
strong
but
that
it
might
be
immediately
repressed
at
the
call
of
duty
and
if
the
idea
arose
to
her
of
this
great
love
to
another
as
standing
in
her
way
she
immediately
answered
it
by
how
would
it
have
been
if
i
had
been
married
as
i
could
have
overcome
then
so
i
can
scudder
came
into
her
room
with
a
candle
in
her
hand
and
mary
accustomed
to
read
the
expressions
of
her
mother
s
face
saw
at
a
glance
a
visible
discomposure
there
she
held
the
light
so
that
it
shone
upon
mary
s
face
are
you
asleep
she
said
no
are
you
unwell
no
mother
only
a
little
scudder
set
down
the
candle
and
shut
the
door
and
after
a
moment
s
hesitation
said
my
daughter
i
have
some
news
to
tell
you
which
i
want
you
to
prepare
your
mind
for
keep
yourself
quite
quiet
oh
mother
said
mary
stretching
out
her
hands
towards
her
i
know
it
james
has
come
how
did
you
hear
said
her
mother
with
astonishment
i
have
seen
him
scudder
s
countenance
fell
where
i
went
to
walk
home
with
cerinthy
twitchel
and
as
i
was
coming
back
he
came
up
behind
me
just
at
savin
scudder
sat
down
on
the
bed
and
took
her
daughter
s
hand
i
trust
my
dear
child
she
stopped
i
think
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
mother
it
is
a
great
joy
and
a
great
relief
but
of
course
i
shall
be
true
to
my
engagement
with
the
scudder
s
face
brightened
that
is
my
own
daughter
i
might
have
known
that
you
would
do
so
you
would
not
certainly
so
cruelly
disappoint
a
noble
man
that
has
set
his
whole
faith
on
no
mother
i
shall
disappoint
him
i
told
james
that
i
should
be
true
to
my
he
will
probably
see
the
justice
of
it
said
scudder
in
that
easy
tone
with
which
elderly
people
are
apt
to
dispose
of
the
feelings
of
young
persons
perhaps
it
may
be
something
of
a
trial
at
mary
looked
at
her
mother
with
incredulous
blue
eyes
the
idea
that
feelings
which
made
her
hold
her
breath
when
she
thought
of
them
could
be
so
summarily
disposed
of
struck
her
as
almost
an
absurdity
she
turned
her
face
weariedly
to
the
wall
with
a
deep
sigh
and
said
after
all
mother
it
is
mercy
enough
and
comfort
enough
to
think
that
he
is
living
poor
cousin
ellen
too
what
a
relief
to
her
it
is
like
life
from
the
dead
oh
i
shall
be
happy
enough
no
fear
of
and
you
know
said
scudder
that
there
has
existed
engagement
of
any
between
you
and
james
he
had
no
right
to
found
any
expectations
on
anything
you
ever
told
that
is
true
also
mother
said
mary
i
had
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
as
marriage
in
relation
to
of
course
pursued
scudder
he
will
always
be
to
you
as
a
near
mary
assented
wearily
there
is
but
a
week
now
before
your
wedding
continued
scudder
and
i
think
cousin
james
if
he
is
reasonable
will
see
the
propriety
of
your
mind
being
kept
as
quiet
as
possible
i
heard
the
news
this
afternoon
in
town
pursued
scudder
from
captain
staunton
and
by
a
curious
coincidence
i
received
this
letter
from
him
from
james
which
came
from
new
york
by
post
the
brig
that
brought
it
must
have
been
delayed
out
of
the
oh
mother
give
it
to
me
said
mary
rising
up
with
animation
he
mentioned
having
sent
me
perhaps
you
had
better
wait
till
morning
said
scudder
you
are
tired
and
oh
mother
i
think
i
shall
be
more
composed
when
i
know
all
that
is
in
it
said
mary
still
stretching
out
her
hand
well
my
daughter
you
are
the
best
judge
said
scudder
and
she
set
down
the
candle
on
the
table
and
left
mary
alone
it
was
a
very
thick
letter
of
many
pages
dated
in
canton
and
ran
as
follows
chapter
xxxvi
my
dearest
mary
have
lived
through
many
wonderful
scenes
since
i
saw
you
last
my
life
has
been
so
adventurous
that
i
scarcely
know
myself
when
i
think
of
it
but
it
is
not
of
i
am
going
now
to
write
i
have
written
all
that
to
mother
and
she
will
show
it
to
you
but
since
i
parted
from
you
there
has
been
another
history
going
on
within
me
and
is
what
i
wish
to
make
you
understand
if
i
can
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
been
a
changed
man
from
that
afternoon
when
i
came
to
your
window
where
we
parted
i
have
never
forgotten
how
you
looked
then
nor
what
you
said
nothing
in
my
life
ever
had
such
an
effect
on
me
i
thought
that
i
loved
you
before
but
i
went
away
feeling
that
was
something
so
deep
and
high
and
sacred
that
was
not
worthy
to
name
it
to
you
i
can
not
think
of
the
man
in
the
world
that
worthy
of
what
you
said
you
felt
for
me
from
hour
there
was
a
new
purpose
in
my
purpose
which
has
led
me
upward
ever
since
i
thought
to
myself
in
this
way
there
is
some
secret
source
from
whence
this
inner
life
springs
and
i
knew
that
it
was
connected
with
the
bible
which
you
gave
me
and
so
i
thought
i
would
read
it
carefully
and
deliberately
to
see
what
i
could
make
of
it
i
began
with
the
beginning
it
impressed
me
with
a
sense
of
something
quaint
and
rather
fragmentary
and
yet
there
were
spots
all
along
that
went
right
to
the
heart
of
a
man
who
has
to
deal
with
life
and
things
as
i
did
now
i
must
say
that
the
doctor
s
preaching
as
i
told
you
never
impressed
me
much
in
any
way
i
could
not
make
any
connection
between
it
and
the
men
i
had
to
manage
and
the
things
i
had
to
do
in
my
daily
life
but
there
were
things
in
the
bible
that
struck
me
otherwise
there
was
passage
in
particular
and
that
was
where
jacob
started
off
from
all
his
friends
to
go
off
and
seek
his
fortune
in
a
strange
country
and
lay
down
to
sleep
all
alone
in
the
field
with
only
a
stone
for
his
pillow
it
seemed
to
me
exactly
the
image
of
what
every
young
man
is
like
when
he
leaves
his
home
and
goes
out
to
shift
for
himself
in
this
hard
world
i
tell
you
mary
that
man
on
the
great
ocean
of
life
feels
himself
a
very
weak
thing
we
are
held
up
by
each
other
more
than
we
know
till
we
go
off
by
ourselves
into
this
great
experiment
well
there
he
was
as
lonesome
as
upon
the
deck
of
my
ship
and
so
lying
with
this
stone
under
his
head
he
saw
a
ladder
in
his
sleep
between
him
and
heaven
and
angels
going
up
and
down
that
was
a
sight
which
came
to
the
very
point
of
his
necessities
he
saw
that
there
was
a
way
between
him
and
god
and
that
there
were
those
above
who
did
care
for
him
and
who
could
come
to
him
to
help
him
well
so
the
next
morning
he
got
up
and
set
up
the
stone
to
mark
the
place
and
it
says
jacob
vowed
a
vow
saying
if
god
will
be
with
me
and
will
keep
me
in
this
way
that
i
go
and
will
give
me
bread
to
eat
and
raiment
to
put
on
so
that
i
come
again
to
my
father
s
house
in
peace
shall
the
lord
be
my
now
there
was
something
that
looked
to
me
like
a
tangible
foundation
to
begin
on
if
i
understand
hopkins
i
believe
he
would
have
called
that
all
selfishness
at
first
sight
it
does
look
a
little
so
but
then
i
thought
of
it
in
this
way
here
he
was
all
alone
god
was
entirely
invisible
to
him
and
how
could
he
feel
certain
that
he
really
existed
unless
he
could
come
into
some
kind
of
connection
with
him
the
point
that
he
wanted
to
be
sure
of
was
more
than
merely
to
know
that
there
was
a
god
who
made
the
world
he
wanted
to
know
whether
he
cared
anything
about
men
and
would
do
anything
to
help
them
and
so
in
fact
it
was
saying
if
there
is
a
god
who
interests
himself
at
all
in
me
and
will
be
my
friend
and
protector
i
will
obey
him
so
far
as
i
can
find
out
his
i
thought
to
myself
this
is
the
great
experiment
and
i
will
try
i
made
in
my
heart
exactly
the
same
resolution
and
just
quietly
resolved
to
assume
for
a
while
as
a
fact
that
there
such
a
god
and
whenever
i
came
to
a
place
where
i
could
not
help
myself
just
to
ask
his
help
honestly
in
so
many
words
and
see
what
would
come
of
it
well
as
i
went
on
reading
through
the
old
testament
i
was
more
and
more
convinced
that
all
the
men
of
those
times
had
tried
this
experiment
and
found
that
it
would
bear
them
and
in
fact
i
did
begin
to
find
in
my
own
experience
a
great
many
things
happening
so
remarkably
that
i
could
not
but
think
that
somebody
did
attend
even
to
my
prayers
i
began
to
feel
a
trembling
faith
that
was
guiding
me
and
that
the
events
of
my
life
were
not
happening
by
accident
but
working
themselves
out
by
his
will
well
as
i
went
on
in
this
way
there
were
other
and
higher
thoughts
kept
rising
in
my
mind
i
wanted
to
be
better
than
i
was
i
had
a
sense
of
a
life
much
nobler
and
purer
than
anything
i
had
ever
lived
that
i
wanted
to
come
up
to
but
in
the
world
of
men
as
i
found
it
such
feelings
are
always
laughed
down
as
romantic
and
impracticable
and
impossible
but
about
this
time
i
began
to
read
the
new
testament
and
then
the
idea
came
to
me
that
the
same
power
that
helped
me
in
the
lower
sphere
of
life
would
help
me
carry
out
these
higher
aspirations
perhaps
the
gospels
would
not
have
interested
me
so
much
if
i
had
begun
with
them
first
but
my
old
testament
life
seemed
to
have
schooled
me
and
brought
me
to
a
place
where
i
wanted
something
higher
and
i
began
to
notice
that
my
prayers
now
were
more
that
i
might
be
noble
and
patient
and
and
constant
in
my
duty
than
for
any
other
kind
of
help
and
then
i
understood
what
met
me
in
the
very
first
of
matthew
he
shall
be
called
jesus
for
he
shall
save
his
people
from
their
i
began
now
to
live
a
new
life
a
life
in
which
i
felt
myself
coming
into
sympathy
with
you
for
mary
when
i
began
to
read
the
gospels
i
took
knowledge
of
you
that
you
had
been
with
jesus
the
crisis
of
my
life
was
that
dreadful
night
of
the
shipwreck
it
was
as
dreadful
as
the
day
of
judgment
no
words
of
mine
can
describe
to
you
what
i
felt
when
i
knew
that
our
rudder
was
gone
and
saw
those
hopeless
rocks
before
i
felt
for
our
poor
men
in
the
midst
of
it
all
the
words
came
into
my
mind
and
jesus
was
in
the
hinder
part
of
the
vessel
asleep
on
a
pillow
and
at
once
i
felt
he
there
and
when
the
ship
struck
i
was
only
conscious
of
an
intense
going
out
of
my
soul
to
him
like
peter
s
when
he
threw
himself
from
the
ship
to
meet
him
in
the
waters
i
will
not
recapitulate
what
i
have
already
wonderful
manner
in
which
i
was
saved
and
in
which
friends
and
help
and
prosperity
and
worldly
success
came
to
me
again
after
life
had
seemed
all
lost
but
now
i
am
ready
to
return
to
my
country
and
i
feel
as
jacob
did
when
he
said
with
my
staff
i
passed
over
this
jordan
but
now
am
i
become
two
i
do
not
need
any
arguments
now
to
convince
me
that
the
bible
is
from
above
there
is
a
great
deal
in
it
that
i
can
not
great
deal
that
seems
to
me
inexplicable
but
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
have
tried
its
directions
and
find
that
in
my
case
they
do
work
that
it
is
a
book
that
i
can
by
and
that
is
enough
for
me
and
now
mary
i
am
coming
home
again
quite
another
man
from
what
i
went
out
with
a
whole
new
world
of
thought
and
feeling
in
my
heart
and
a
new
purpose
by
which
please
god
i
mean
to
shape
my
life
all
this
under
god
i
owe
to
you
and
if
you
will
let
me
devote
my
whole
life
to
you
it
will
be
a
small
return
for
what
you
have
done
for
me
you
know
i
left
you
wholly
free
others
must
have
seen
your
loveliness
and
felt
your
worth
and
you
may
have
learnt
to
love
some
better
man
than
i
but
i
know
not
what
hope
tells
me
that
this
will
not
be
and
i
shall
find
true
what
the
bible
says
of
love
that
many
waters
can
not
quench
it
nor
floods
in
any
case
i
shall
be
always
from
my
very
heart
yours
and
yours
only
till
death
james
mary
rose
after
reading
this
letter
wrapped
into
a
divine
state
of
exaltation
pure
joy
in
contemplating
an
infinite
good
to
another
in
which
the
question
of
self
was
utterly
forgotten
he
was
then
what
she
had
always
hoped
and
prayed
he
would
be
and
she
pressed
the
thought
triumphantly
to
her
heart
he
was
that
true
and
victorious
man
that
christian
able
to
subdue
life
and
to
show
in
a
perfect
and
healthy
manly
nature
a
reflection
of
the
image
of
the
superhuman
excellence
her
prayers
that
night
were
aspirations
and
praises
and
she
felt
how
possible
it
might
be
so
to
appropriate
the
good
and
the
joy
and
the
nobleness
of
others
so
as
to
have
in
them
an
eternal
and
satisfying
pleasure
and
with
this
came
the
dearer
thought
that
she
in
her
weakness
and
solitude
had
been
permitted
to
put
her
hand
to
the
beginning
of
a
work
so
noble
the
consciousness
of
good
done
to
an
immortal
spirit
is
wealth
that
neither
life
nor
death
can
take
away
and
so
having
prayed
she
lay
down
with
that
sleep
which
god
giveth
to
his
beloved
chapter
xxxvii
it
is
a
hard
condition
of
our
existence
here
that
every
exaltation
must
have
its
depression
god
will
not
let
us
have
heaven
here
below
but
only
such
glimpses
and
faint
showings
as
parents
sometimes
give
to
children
when
they
show
them
beforehand
the
jewelry
and
pictures
and
stores
of
rare
and
curious
treasures
which
they
hold
in
store
for
the
possession
of
their
riper
years
so
it
very
often
happens
that
the
man
who
entranced
by
some
rapturous
excitement
has
gone
to
bed
an
angel
feeling
as
if
all
sin
were
for
ever
vanquished
and
he
himself
immutably
grounded
in
love
may
wake
the
next
morning
with
a
sick
headache
and
if
he
be
not
careful
may
scold
about
his
breakfast
like
a
miserable
sinner
we
will
not
say
that
our
dear
little
mary
rose
in
this
condition
next
morning
for
although
she
had
the
headache
she
had
one
of
those
natures
in
which
somehow
or
other
the
combative
element
seems
to
be
left
out
so
that
no
one
ever
knew
her
to
speak
a
fretful
word
but
still
as
we
have
observed
she
had
the
headache
and
the
depression
and
then
came
the
slow
creeping
sense
of
a
through
all
her
heart
and
soul
of
a
thousand
thousand
things
that
could
be
said
only
to
person
and
that
person
one
that
it
would
be
temptation
and
danger
to
say
them
to
she
came
out
of
her
room
to
her
morning
work
with
a
face
resolved
and
calm
but
expressive
of
languor
with
slight
signs
of
some
inward
struggle
madame
de
frontignac
who
had
already
heard
the
intelligence
threw
two
or
three
of
her
bright
glances
upon
her
at
breakfast
and
at
once
divined
how
the
matter
stood
she
was
of
a
nature
so
delicately
sensitive
to
the
most
refined
shades
of
honour
that
she
apprehended
at
once
that
there
must
be
a
conflict
though
judging
by
her
own
impulsive
nature
she
made
no
doubt
that
all
would
at
once
go
down
before
the
mighty
force
of
reawakened
love
after
breakfast
she
would
insist
upon
following
mary
about
through
all
her
avocations
she
possessed
herself
of
a
towel
and
would
wipe
the
teacups
and
saucers
while
mary
washed
she
clinked
the
glasses
and
rattled
the
cups
and
spoons
and
stepped
about
as
briskly
as
if
she
had
two
or
three
breezes
to
carry
her
train
and
chattered
and
for
the
sake
of
bringing
into
mary
s
cheek
the
shy
slow
dimples
that
she
liked
to
watch
but
still
scudder
was
around
with
an
air
as
provident
and
forbidding
as
that
of
a
setting
hen
who
watches
her
nest
nor
was
it
till
after
all
things
had
been
cleared
away
in
the
house
and
mary
had
gone
up
into
her
little
attic
to
spin
that
the
opportunity
long
sought
came
of
diving
to
the
bottom
of
this
mystery
marie
nous
voilà
are
you
not
going
to
tell
me
anything
when
i
have
turned
my
heart
out
to
you
like
a
bag
enfant
how
happy
you
must
be
she
said
embracing
her
yes
i
am
very
happy
said
mary
with
calm
gravity
happy
said
madame
de
frontignac
mimicking
her
manner
is
that
the
way
you
american
girls
show
it
when
you
are
very
happy
come
come
tell
little
verginie
something
thou
hast
seen
this
hero
this
wandering
ulysses
he
has
come
back
at
tapestry
will
not
be
quite
as
long
as
penelope
s
speak
to
me
of
him
has
he
beautiful
black
eyes
and
hair
that
curls
like
a
tell
me
i
only
saw
him
a
little
while
said
mary
and
i
a
great
deal
more
than
i
saw
he
could
not
have
been
any
clearer
to
me
than
he
always
has
been
in
my
but
i
think
said
madame
de
frontignac
seating
mary
as
was
her
wont
and
sitting
down
at
her
feet
i
think
you
are
a
little
about
this
very
likely
you
pity
the
poor
priest
it
is
sad
for
him
but
a
good
priest
has
the
church
for
his
bride
you
you
do
not
think
said
mary
speaking
seriously
that
i
shall
break
my
promise
given
before
god
to
this
good
man
dieu
mon
enfant
you
do
not
mean
to
marry
the
priest
after
all
idée
but
i
him
said
mary
madame
de
frontignac
threw
up
her
hands
with
an
expression
of
vexation
what
a
pity
my
little
one
you
are
not
in
the
true
church
any
good
priest
could
dispense
you
from
i
do
not
believe
said
mary
in
any
earthly
power
that
can
dispense
us
from
solemn
obligations
which
we
have
assumed
before
god
and
on
which
we
have
suffered
others
to
build
the
most
precious
hopes
if
james
had
won
the
affections
of
some
girl
thinking
as
i
do
i
should
not
feel
it
right
for
him
to
leave
her
and
come
to
me
the
bible
says
that
the
just
man
is
he
that
sweareth
to
his
own
hurt
and
changeth
this
is
the
sublime
of
duty
said
madame
de
frontignac
who
with
the
airy
facility
of
her
race
never
lost
her
appreciation
of
the
fine
points
of
anything
that
went
on
under
her
eyes
but
nevertheless
she
was
inwardly
resolved
that
picturesque
as
this
sublime
of
duty
was
it
must
not
be
allowed
to
pass
beyond
the
limits
of
a
fine
art
and
so
she
recommenced
c
est
absurde
this
beautiful
young
man
with
his
black
eyes
and
his
real
mary
just
come
home
from
killing
a
loves
you
with
his
whole
this
dreadful
promise
why
haven
t
you
any
sort
of
people
in
your
church
that
can
unbind
you
from
promises
i
should
think
the
good
priest
himself
would
do
it
perhaps
he
would
said
mary
if
i
would
ask
him
but
that
would
be
equivalent
to
a
breach
of
it
of
course
no
man
would
marry
a
woman
that
asked
to
be
you
are
an
angel
of
delicacy
my
child
est
admirable
but
after
all
mary
this
is
not
well
listen
now
to
me
you
are
a
very
sweet
saint
and
very
strong
in
goodness
i
think
you
must
have
a
very
strong
angel
that
takes
care
of
you
but
think
what
it
is
to
marry
one
man
while
you
love
but
i
love
the
doctor
said
mary
evasively
said
madame
de
frontignac
oh
marie
you
may
love
him
well
but
you
and
i
both
know
that
there
is
something
deeper
than
that
what
will
you
with
this
young
man
must
he
move
away
from
this
place
and
not
be
with
his
poor
mother
any
more
or
can
you
see
him
and
hear
him
and
be
with
him
after
your
marriage
and
not
feel
that
you
love
him
more
than
your
husband
i
should
hope
that
god
would
help
me
to
feel
right
said
mary
i
am
very
much
afraid
he
will
not
said
madame
i
asked
him
a
great
many
times
to
help
when
i
found
how
wrong
it
all
was
and
he
did
not
you
remember
what
you
told
the
other
day
that
if
i
would
do
right
i
must
not
that
man
any
you
will
have
to
ask
him
to
go
away
from
this
place
you
can
never
see
him
for
this
love
will
never
die
till
die
that
you
may
be
sure
of
is
it
wise
is
it
right
dear
little
one
he
leave
his
home
for
ever
for
you
or
must
you
struggle
always
and
grow
whiter
and
whiter
and
whiter
and
fade
away
into
heaven
like
the
moon
this
morning
and
nobody
know
what
is
the
matter
people
will
say
you
have
the
or
the
consumption
or
something
nobody
ever
knows
what
we
women
die
poor
mary
s
conscience
was
fairly
posed
this
appeal
struck
upon
her
sense
of
right
as
having
its
grounds
she
felt
inexpressibly
confused
and
distressed
oh
i
wish
somebody
would
tell
me
exactly
what
right
she
said
well
will
said
madame
de
frontignac
go
down
to
the
dear
priest
and
tell
him
the
whole
truth
my
dear
child
do
you
think
if
he
should
ever
find
it
out
after
your
marriage
he
would
think
you
used
him
right
and
yet
does
not
think
so
mother
does
not
wish
me
to
tell
him
always
the
mother
yes
it
is
always
the
mothers
that
stand
in
the
way
of
the
lovers
why
can
not
she
marry
the
priest
herself
she
said
between
her
teeth
and
then
looked
up
startled
and
guilty
to
see
if
mary
had
heard
her
i
said
mary
i
can
not
go
against
my
conscience
and
my
mother
and
my
best
at
this
moment
the
conference
was
cut
short
by
scudder
s
provident
footstep
on
the
garret
stairs
a
vague
suspicion
of
something
had
haunted
her
during
her
and
she
resolved
to
come
and
put
a
stop
to
the
interview
by
telling
mary
that
miss
prissy
wanted
her
to
come
and
be
measured
for
the
skirt
of
her
dress
scudder
by
the
use
of
that
sixth
sense
peculiar
to
mothers
had
divined
that
there
had
been
some
agitating
conference
and
had
she
been
questioned
about
it
her
guesses
as
to
what
it
might
be
would
probably
have
given
no
bad
of
the
real
state
of
the
case
she
was
inwardly
resolved
that
there
should
be
no
more
such
for
the
present
and
kept
mary
employed
about
various
matters
relating
to
the
dresses
so
scrupulously
that
there
was
no
opportunity
for
anything
more
of
the
sort
that
day
in
the
evening
james
marvyn
came
down
and
was
welcomed
with
the
greatest
demonstrations
of
joy
by
all
but
mary
who
sat
distant
and
embarrassed
after
the
first
salutations
had
passed
the
doctor
was
innocently
parental
but
we
fear
there
was
small
reciprocation
of
the
sentiments
he
expressed
on
the
part
of
the
young
man
miss
prissy
indeed
had
had
her
heart
somewhat
touched
as
good
little
women
s
hearts
are
apt
to
be
by
a
true
love
story
and
had
hinted
something
of
her
feelings
to
scudder
in
a
manner
which
brought
such
a
severe
rejoinder
as
quite
humbled
and
abashed
her
so
that
she
coweringly
took
refuge
under
her
former
declaration
that
to
be
sure
there
couldn
t
be
any
man
in
the
world
better
of
mary
than
the
while
still
at
her
heart
she
was
possessed
with
that
troublesome
preference
for
unworthy
people
which
stands
in
the
way
of
so
many
excellent
things
but
she
went
on
vigorously
sewing
on
the
and
pursing
up
her
small
mouth
into
the
most
perfect
and
guarded
expression
of
though
she
said
afterwards
it
went
to
her
heart
to
see
how
that
poor
young
man
did
look
sitting
there
just
as
noble
and
as
handsome
as
a
pictur
she
didn
t
see
for
part
how
anybody
s
heart
stand
it
then
to
be
sure
as
scudder
said
the
poor
doctor
ought
to
be
thought
about
dear
blessed
man
what
a
pity
it
was
things
turn
out
so
not
that
it
was
a
pity
that
jim
came
home
was
a
great
providence
but
a
pity
they
hadn
t
known
about
it
sooner
well
for
her
part
she
didn
t
pretend
to
say
the
path
of
duty
did
have
a
great
many
hard
places
in
it
as
for
james
during
his
interview
at
the
cottage
he
waited
and
tried
in
vain
for
one
moment
s
solitary
conversation
scudder
was
immovable
in
her
motherly
kindness
sitting
there
smiling
and
chatting
with
him
but
never
stirring
from
her
place
by
mary
madame
de
frontignac
was
out
of
all
patience
and
determined
in
her
small
way
to
do
something
to
discompose
the
fixed
state
of
things
so
retreating
to
her
room
she
contrived
in
very
desperation
to
upset
and
break
a
shrieking
violently
in
french
and
english
at
the
deluge
which
came
upon
the
sanded
floor
and
the
little
piece
of
carpet
by
the
bedside
what
housekeeper
s
instincts
are
proof
against
the
crash
of
breaking
china
scudder
fled
from
her
seat
followed
by
miss
ah
then
and
there
was
hurrying
to
and
fro
mary
sat
quiet
as
a
statue
bending
over
her
sewing
and
james
knowing
that
it
must
be
now
or
never
was
like
a
flash
in
the
empty
chair
by
her
side
with
his
black
moustache
very
near
the
bent
brown
head
mary
he
said
you
let
me
see
you
once
more
all
is
not
said
is
it
just
hear
me
once
alone
oh
james
i
am
too
weak
i
dare
not
i
am
afraid
of
you
think
he
said
that
you
take
this
course
because
it
is
right
but
it
right
it
right
to
marry
man
when
you
love
another
better
i
don
t
put
this
to
your
inclination
mary
i
know
it
would
be
of
no
use
i
put
it
to
your
oh
i
never
was
so
perplexed
before
said
mary
i
don
t
know
what
i
think
i
must
have
time
to
reflect
and
you
oh
james
you
let
me
do
right
there
will
never
be
any
happiness
for
me
if
i
do
for
you
all
this
while
the
sounds
of
running
and
hurrying
in
madame
de
frontignac
s
room
had
been
unintermitted
and
miss
prissy
not
without
some
glimmerings
of
perception
into
the
state
of
things
was
holding
tight
on
to
scudder
s
gown
detailing
to
her
a
most
capital
receipt
for
mending
broken
china
the
history
of
which
she
traced
regularly
through
all
the
families
in
which
she
had
ever
worked
varying
the
details
with
small
items
of
family
history
and
little
incidents
as
to
the
births
marriages
and
deaths
of
different
people
for
whom
it
had
been
employed
with
all
the
particulars
of
how
where
and
when
so
that
the
time
of
james
for
conversation
was
by
this
means
indefinitely
extended
now
he
said
to
mary
let
me
propose
one
thing
let
go
to
the
doctor
and
tell
him
the
james
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
i
can
a
friend
who
has
been
so
considerate
so
kind
so
and
disinterested
and
whom
i
have
allowed
to
go
on
with
this
implicit
faith
in
me
so
long
should
james
think
of
only
i
do
not
i
trust
think
of
myself
only
said
james
i
hope
that
i
am
calm
enough
and
have
a
heart
to
think
for
others
but
i
ask
you
is
it
doing
right
to
to
let
him
marry
you
in
ignorance
of
the
state
of
your
feelings
is
it
a
kindness
to
a
good
and
noble
man
to
give
yourself
to
him
only
seemingly
when
the
best
and
noblest
part
of
your
affection
is
gone
wholly
beyond
your
control
i
am
quite
sure
of
mary
i
know
you
do
love
him
very
well
that
you
would
make
a
most
true
affectionate
constant
wife
to
him
but
what
i
you
feel
for
me
is
something
wholly
out
of
your
power
to
give
to
him
is
it
not
now
i
think
it
is
said
mary
looking
gravely
and
deeply
thoughtful
but
then
james
i
ask
myself
what
if
all
this
had
happened
a
week
hence
my
feelings
would
have
been
just
the
same
because
they
are
feelings
over
which
i
have
no
more
control
than
over
my
existence
i
can
only
control
the
expression
of
them
but
in
case
you
would
not
have
asked
me
to
break
my
marriage
vow
and
why
now
shall
i
break
a
solemn
vow
deliberately
made
before
god
if
what
i
can
give
him
will
content
him
and
he
never
knows
that
which
would
give
him
pain
what
wrong
is
done
him
i
should
think
the
deepest
possible
wrong
done
me
said
james
if
when
i
thought
i
had
married
a
wife
with
a
whole
heart
i
found
that
the
greater
part
of
it
had
been
before
that
given
to
another
if
you
tell
him
or
if
i
tell
him
or
your
mother
who
is
the
more
proper
person
and
he
chooses
to
hold
you
to
your
promise
then
mary
i
have
no
more
to
say
i
shall
sail
in
a
few
weeks
again
and
carry
your
image
for
ever
in
my
heart
nobody
can
take
that
away
and
dear
shadow
will
be
the
only
wife
i
shall
ever
at
this
moment
miss
prissy
came
rattling
along
towards
the
door
talking
we
suspect
designedly
in
quite
a
high
key
mary
hastily
said
wait
james
let
me
think
is
the
monday
i
will
send
you
word
or
see
and
when
miss
prissy
returned
into
the
best
room
james
was
sitting
at
one
window
and
mary
at
another
he
making
remarks
in
a
style
of
most
admirable
commonplace
on
a
copy
of
milton
s
paradise
lost
which
he
had
picked
up
in
the
confusion
of
the
moment
and
which
at
the
time
katy
scudder
entered
he
was
declaring
to
be
a
most
excellent
book
and
a
really
truly
valuable
work
scudder
looked
keenly
from
one
to
the
other
and
saw
that
mary
s
cheek
was
glowing
like
the
deepest
heart
of
a
pink
shell
while
in
all
other
respects
she
was
as
cold
and
calm
on
the
whole
she
felt
satisfied
that
no
mischief
had
been
done
we
hope
our
readers
will
do
scudder
justice
it
is
true
that
she
yet
wore
on
her
third
finger
the
marriage
ring
of
a
sailor
lover
and
his
memory
was
yet
fresh
in
her
heart
but
even
mothers
who
have
married
for
love
themselves
somehow
so
blend
their
daughter
s
existence
with
their
own
as
to
conceive
that
she
must
marry
love
and
not
her
own
beside
this
scudder
was
an
old
testament
woman
brought
up
with
that
scrupulous
exactitude
of
fidelity
in
relation
to
promises
which
would
naturally
come
from
familiarity
with
a
book
where
is
represented
as
one
of
the
highest
attributes
of
deity
and
as
one
of
the
vilest
sins
of
humanity
to
break
the
word
that
had
gone
forth
out
of
one
s
mouth
was
to
lose
and
all
claim
to
the
respect
of
others
and
to
sin
against
eternal
rectitude
as
we
have
said
before
it
is
almost
impossible
to
make
our
modern
times
comprehend
the
earnestness
with
which
these
people
lived
it
was
in
the
beginning
no
vulgar
nor
mercenary
ambition
that
made
scudder
desire
the
doctor
as
a
husband
for
her
daughter
he
was
poor
and
she
had
had
offers
from
richer
men
he
was
often
unpopular
but
he
was
the
man
in
the
world
she
most
revered
the
man
she
believed
in
with
the
most
implicit
faith
the
man
who
embodied
her
highest
idea
of
the
good
and
therefore
it
was
that
she
was
willing
to
resign
her
child
to
him
as
to
james
she
had
felt
truly
sympathetic
with
his
mother
and
with
mary
in
the
dreadful
hour
when
they
supposed
him
lost
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
great
perplexity
occasioned
by
his
return
she
would
have
received
him
as
a
relative
with
open
arms
but
now
she
felt
it
her
duty
to
be
on
the
defensive
an
attitude
not
the
most
favourable
for
cherishing
pleasing
associations
in
regard
to
another
she
had
read
the
letter
giving
an
account
of
his
spiritual
experience
with
very
sincere
pleasure
as
a
good
woman
should
but
not
without
an
internal
perception
how
very
much
it
endangered
her
favourite
plans
but
when
mary
had
calmly
reiterated
her
determination
she
felt
sure
of
her
for
had
she
ever
known
her
to
say
a
thing
she
did
not
do
the
uneasiness
she
felt
at
present
was
not
the
doubt
of
her
daughter
s
steadiness
but
the
fear
that
she
might
have
been
unsuitably
harassed
or
annoyed
chapter
xxxviii
the
next
morning
rose
calm
and
fair
it
was
the
the
sabbath
in
mary
s
maiden
life
if
her
promises
and
plans
were
fulfilled
mary
dressed
herself
in
hands
trembling
with
unusual
agitation
her
sensitive
nature
divided
between
two
opposing
consciences
and
two
opposing
affections
her
devoted
filial
love
towards
the
doctor
made
her
feel
the
keenest
sensitiveness
at
the
thought
of
giving
him
pain
at
the
same
time
the
questions
which
james
had
proposed
to
her
had
raised
serious
doubts
in
her
mind
whether
it
was
altogether
right
to
suffer
him
blindly
to
enter
into
this
union
so
after
she
was
all
prepared
she
bolted
the
door
of
her
chamber
and
opening
her
bible
read
if
any
man
lack
wisdom
let
him
ask
of
god
who
giveth
to
all
liberally
and
upbraideth
not
and
it
shall
be
given
and
then
kneeling
down
by
the
bed
she
asked
that
god
would
give
her
some
immediate
light
in
her
present
perplexity
so
praying
her
mind
grew
calm
and
steady
and
she
rose
up
at
the
sound
of
the
bell
which
marked
that
it
was
time
to
set
forward
for
church
everybody
noticed
as
she
came
into
the
church
that
morning
how
beautiful
mary
scudder
looked
it
was
no
longer
the
beauty
of
the
carved
statue
the
pale
alabaster
shrine
the
sainted
virgin
but
a
warm
bright
living
light
that
spoke
of
some
summer
breath
breathing
within
her
soul
when
she
took
her
place
in
the
singers
seat
she
knew
without
turning
her
head
that
was
in
his
old
place
not
far
from
her
side
and
those
whose
eyes
followed
her
to
the
gallery
marvelled
at
her
face
the
pure
and
eloquent
blood
spoke
in
her
cheeks
and
so
divinely
wrought
that
you
might
almost
say
her
body
thought
for
a
thousand
delicate
nerves
were
becoming
vital
once
more
as
the
holy
mystery
of
womanhood
wrought
within
her
when
they
rose
to
sing
the
tune
must
needs
be
one
which
mary
and
james
had
often
sung
together
out
of
the
same
book
at
the
singing
of
those
wild
pleading
tunes
dear
to
the
heart
of
new
england
born
if
we
may
credit
the
report
in
the
rocky
hollow
of
its
mountains
and
whose
notes
have
a
kind
of
grand
and
mournful
triumph
in
their
warbling
wail
the
different
parts
of
the
harmony
set
contrary
to
all
the
canons
of
musical
pharisaism
had
still
a
singular
and
romantic
effect
which
a
true
musical
genius
would
not
have
failed
to
recognize
the
four
parts
tenor
treble
bass
and
counter
as
they
were
then
called
rose
and
swelled
and
wildly
mingled
with
the
fitful
strangeness
of
an
æolian
harp
or
of
winds
in
mountain
hollows
or
the
vague
moanings
of
the
sea
on
lone
forsaken
shores
and
mary
while
her
voice
rose
over
the
waves
of
the
treble
and
trembled
with
a
pathetic
richness
felt
to
her
inmost
heart
the
deep
accord
of
that
other
voice
which
came
to
meet
hers
so
wildly
melancholy
as
if
the
soul
in
that
manly
breast
had
come
forth
to
meet
her
soul
in
the
disembodied
shadowy
verity
of
eternity
that
grand
old
tune
called
by
our
fathers
china
never
with
its
melody
drew
two
souls
more
out
of
themselves
and
entwined
them
more
nearly
with
each
other
the
last
verse
of
the
hymn
spoke
of
the
resurrection
of
the
saints
with
then
let
the
last
dread
trumpet
sound
and
bid
the
dead
arise
awake
ye
nations
underground
ye
saints
ascend
the
and
as
mary
sang
she
felt
sublimely
upborn
with
the
idea
that
life
is
but
a
moment
and
love
is
immortal
and
seemed
in
a
shadowy
trance
to
feel
herself
and
him
past
this
mortal
pain
far
over
on
the
shores
of
that
other
life
ascending
with
christ
all
glorified
all
tears
wiped
away
and
with
full
permission
to
love
and
to
be
loved
for
ever
and
as
she
sang
the
doctor
looked
upward
and
marvelled
at
the
light
in
her
eyes
and
the
rich
bloom
on
her
cheek
for
where
she
stood
a
sunbeam
streaming
aslant
through
the
dusty
panes
of
the
window
touched
her
head
with
a
kind
of
glory
and
the
thought
he
then
received
outbreathed
itself
in
the
yet
more
fervent
adoration
of
his
prayer
chapter
xxxix
our
fathers
believed
in
special
answers
to
prayer
they
were
not
stumbled
by
the
objection
about
the
inflexibility
of
the
laws
of
nature
because
they
had
the
idea
that
when
the
creator
of
the
world
promised
to
answer
human
prayers
he
probably
understood
the
laws
of
nature
as
well
as
they
did
at
any
rate
the
laws
of
nature
were
his
affairs
and
not
theirs
they
were
men
very
apt
as
the
duke
of
wellington
said
to
look
to
their
which
being
found
to
read
be
careful
for
nothing
but
in
everything
by
prayer
and
supplication
let
your
requests
be
made
known
unto
god
they
did
it
they
looked
unto
him
and
were
likened
and
their
faces
were
not
one
reads
in
the
memoirs
of
hopkins
how
newport
gardner
one
of
his
african
catechumens
a
negro
of
singular
genius
and
ability
being
desirous
of
his
freedom
that
he
might
be
a
missionary
to
africa
and
having
long
worked
without
being
able
to
raise
the
amount
required
was
counselled
by
hopkins
that
it
might
be
a
shorter
way
to
seek
his
freedom
from
the
lord
by
a
day
of
solemn
fasting
and
prayer
the
historical
fact
is
that
on
the
evening
of
a
day
so
consecrated
his
master
returned
from
church
called
newport
to
him
and
presented
him
with
his
freedom
is
it
not
possible
that
he
who
made
the
world
may
have
established
laws
for
prayer
as
invariable
as
those
for
the
sowing
of
seed
and
raising
of
grain
is
it
not
as
legitimate
a
subject
of
inquiry
when
petitions
are
not
answered
of
these
laws
has
been
neglected
but
be
that
as
it
may
certain
it
is
that
a
train
of
events
were
set
in
operation
this
day
which
went
directly
towards
answering
mary
s
morning
supplication
for
guidance
candace
who
on
this
particular
morning
had
contrived
to
place
herself
where
she
could
see
mary
and
james
in
the
singers
seat
had
certain
thoughts
borne
in
on
her
mind
which
bore
fruit
afterwards
in
a
solemn
and
select
conversation
held
with
miss
prissy
at
the
end
of
the
by
the
during
the
intermission
between
the
morning
and
afternoon
sermons
candace
sat
on
a
fragment
of
a
granite
boulder
which
lay
there
her
black
face
relieved
against
a
clump
of
yellow
mulleins
then
in
majestic
altitude
on
her
lap
was
spread
a
check
containing
rich
slices
of
cheese
and
a
store
of
her
favourite
brown
now
miss
prissy
she
said
der
s
in
all
things
and
a
good
deal
in
some
things
dan
der
is
in
others
dere
s
a
good
deal
more
reason
in
two
young
handsome
folks
coming
together
dan
der
is
candace
finished
the
sentence
by
an
emphatic
flourish
of
her
now
as
long
as
everybody
thought
massa
jim
was
dead
dere
wa
n
t
nothin
in
de
world
else
done
for
miss
mary
to
marry
the
doctor
but
good
lord
i
heard
him
to
marvyn
last
night
it
kinder
most
broke
my
heart
why
dem
two
poor
s
just
as
onhappy
s
dey
can
be
and
she
s
got
too
much
feelin
for
the
doctor
to
say
a
word
and
say
orter
be
told
on
dat
s
what
i
say
said
candace
giving
a
decisive
bite
to
her
i
say
so
too
said
miss
prissy
why
i
never
had
such
feelings
in
my
life
as
i
did
yesterday
when
that
young
man
came
down
to
our
house
he
was
just
as
pale
as
a
cloth
i
tried
to
say
a
word
to
scudder
but
she
snapped
me
up
so
she
s
an
awful
decided
woman
when
her
mind
s
made
up
i
was
telling
cerinthy
ann
twitchel
she
come
round
me
this
noon
that
it
didn
t
exactly
seem
to
me
right
that
things
should
go
on
as
they
re
gone
to
and
says
i
cerinthy
ann
i
don
t
know
anything
what
to
and
says
she
if
i
was
you
miss
prissy
i
know
what
i
d
do
i
d
tell
the
says
she
nobody
ever
takes
offence
at
anything
do
miss
to
be
sure
added
miss
prissy
i
talked
to
people
about
a
good
many
things
that
it
s
rather
strange
i
should
cause
i
ain
t
one
somehow
that
can
let
things
go
that
seem
to
want
doing
i
always
told
folks
that
i
should
spoil
a
novel
before
it
got
through
the
first
volume
by
blirting
out
some
of
those
things
that
they
let
go
trailing
on
till
everybody
gets
so
mixed
up
they
don
t
know
what
they
re
well
now
honey
said
candace
authoritatively
ef
you
ve
got
any
notion
o
that
kind
i
think
it
must
a
come
from
de
good
lord
and
i
vise
ye
to
be
tendin
to
it
right
away
you
just
go
long
and
tell
de
doctor
yo
self
all
you
knows
and
den
let
s
see
what
ll
come
on
t
i
tell
you
i
b
lieves
it
ll
be
one
o
the
best
day
s
works

in
your
well
said
miss
prissy
i
guess
before
i
go
to
bed
i
ll
make
a
dive
at
him
when
a
thing
s
once
out
it
s
out
and
can
t
be
got
in
again
even
if
people
don
t
like
it
and
that
s
a
mercy
anyhow
it
really
makes
me
feel
most
wicked
to
think
of
it
for
the
doctor
is
the
blessedest
that
s
what
he
said
candace
but
den
de
blessedest
men
in
the
world
ought
fur
to
know
de
truth
that
s
what
yes
true
enough
said
miss
prissy
i
ll
tell
him
miss
prissy
was
as
good
as
her
word
for
that
evening
when
the
doctor
had
retired
to
his
study
she
took
her
light
in
her
hand
and
walking
softly
as
a
cat
tapped
rather
timidly
at
the
study
door
which
the
doctor
opening
said
ah
miss
prissy
if
you
please
sir
said
miss
prissy
i
d
like
a
little
the
doctor
was
well
enough
used
to
such
requests
from
the
female
members
of
his
church
which
generally
were
the
prelude
to
some
disclosures
of
internal
difficulties
or
spiritual
experiences
he
therefore
graciously
motioned
her
to
a
chair
i
thought
i
must
come
in
she
began
busily
twirling
a
bit
of
her
sunday
gown
i
is
i
felt
it
my
ought
to
tell
perhaps
you
ought
to
the
doctor
looked
civilly
concerned
he
did
not
know
but
miss
prissy
s
wits
were
taking
leave
of
her
he
replied
however
with
his
usual
honest
stateliness
i
trust
dear
madam
that
you
will
feel
at
perfect
freedom
to
open
to
me
any
exercises
of
mind
that
you
may
it
isn
t
about
myself
said
prissy
if
you
please
it
s
about
sir
and
the
doctor
looked
awake
in
right
earnest
and
very
much
astonished
besides
and
he
looked
eagerly
at
miss
prissy
to
have
her
go
on
i
don
t
know
how
you
would
view
such
a
matter
said
miss
prissy
but
the
fact
is
that
james
marvyn
and
mary
always
did
love
each
other
ever
since
they
were
still
the
doctor
was
unawakened
to
the
real
meaning
of
the
words
and
he
answered
simply
i
should
be
far
from
wishing
to
interfere
with
so
very
natural
and
innocent
a
sentiment
which
i
make
no
doubt
is
all
quite
as
it
should
no
but
said
miss
prissy
you
don
t
understand
what
i
mean
i
mean
that
james
marvyn
wanted
to
marry
mary
and
that
she
she
wasn
t
engaged
to
madam
said
the
doctor
in
a
voice
that
frightened
miss
prissy
out
of
her
chair
while
a
blaze
like
shot
from
his
eyes
and
his
face
flushed
crimson
mercy
on
us
doctor
i
hope
you
ll
excuse
me
but
there
the
fact
is
out
i
ve
said
it
out
the
fact
is
they
wa
n
t
engaged
but
that
mary
loved
him
ever
since
he
was
a
boy
as
she
never
will
and
never
can
love
any
man
again
in
this
world
is
what
i
m
just
as
sure
of
as
that
i
m
standing
here
and
i
ve
felt
you
ought
to
know
it
cause
i
m
quite
sure
that
if
he
d
been
alive
she
d
never
given
the
promise
she
promise
that
she
means
to
keep
if
her
heart
breaks
and
his
too
there
wouldn
t
anybody
tell
you
and
i
thought
i
must
tell
you
cause
i
thought
you
d
know
what
was
right
to
do
about
during
all
this
latter
speech
the
doctor
was
standing
with
his
back
to
miss
prissy
and
his
face
to
the
window
just
as
he
did
some
time
before
when
scudder
came
to
tell
him
of
mary
s
consent
he
made
a
gesture
backward
without
speaking
that
she
should
leave
the
apartment
and
miss
prissy
left
with
a
guilty
kind
of
feeling
as
if
she
had
been
plunging
a
knife
in
her
pastor
and
rushing
distractedly
across
the
entry
into
mary
s
little
bedroom
she
bolted
the
door
threw
herself
on
the
bed
and
began
to
cry
well
i
ve
done
it
she
said
to
herself
he
s
a
very
strong
hearty
man
she
soliloquized
so
i
hope
it
won
t
put
him
in
a
consumption
men
do
go
in
a
consumption
about
such
things
sometimes
i
remember
abner
seaforth
then
he
was
always
and
had
the
liver
complaint
or
something
i
don
t
know
what
scudder
say
but
i
ve
done
it
poor
man
such
a
good
man
too
i
declare
i
feel
just
like
herod
taking
off
john
the
baptist
s
head
well
well
it
s
done
and
can
t
be
just
at
this
moment
miss
prissy
heard
a
gentle
tap
at
the
door
and
started
as
if
it
had
been
a
being
able
to
rid
herself
of
the
impression
that
somehow
she
had
committed
a
great
crime
for
which
retribution
was
knocking
at
the
door
it
was
mary
who
said
in
her
sweetest
and
most
natural
tones
miss
prissy
the
doctor
would
like
to
see
mary
was
much
astonished
at
the
frightened
discomposed
manner
with
which
miss
prissy
received
this
announcement
and
said
i
m
afraid
i
ve
waked
you
up
out
of
sleep
i
don
t
think
there
s
the
least
miss
prissy
didn
t
either
but
she
reflected
afterwards
that
she
might
as
well
get
through
with
it
at
once
and
therefore
smoothing
her
tumbled
she
went
to
the
doctor
s
study
this
time
he
was
quite
composed
and
received
her
with
a
mournful
gravity
and
requested
her
to
be
seated
i
beg
madam
he
said
you
will
excuse
the
abruptness
of
my
manner
in
our
late
interview
i
was
so
little
prepared
for
the
communication
you
had
to
make
that
i
was
perhaps
unsuitably
discomposed
will
you
allow
me
to
ask
whether
you
were
requested
by
any
of
the
parties
to
communicate
to
me
what
you
did
no
sir
said
miss
prissy
have
any
of
the
parties
ever
communicated
with
you
on
the
subject
at
all
said
the
doctor
no
sir
said
miss
prissy
that
is
all
said
the
doctor
i
will
not
detain
you
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
he
rose
and
opened
the
door
for
her
to
pass
out
and
miss
prissy
overawed
by
the
stately
gravity
of
his
manner
went
out
in
silence
chapter
xl
when
miss
prissy
left
the
room
the
doctor
sat
down
by
the
table
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
he
had
a
large
passionate
determined
nature
and
he
had
just
come
to
one
of
those
cruel
crises
in
life
in
the
which
it
is
apt
to
seem
to
us
that
the
whole
force
of
our
that
we
can
hope
or
wish
or
been
suffered
to
gather
itself
into
one
great
wave
only
to
break
upon
some
cold
rock
of
inevitable
fate
and
go
back
moaning
into
emptiness
in
such
hours
men
and
women
have
cursed
god
and
life
and
thrown
violently
down
and
trampled
under
their
feet
what
yet
was
left
of
life
s
blessings
in
the
fierce
bitterness
of
despair
this
or
nothing
the
soul
shrieks
in
her
frenzy
at
just
such
points
as
these
men
have
plunged
into
intemperance
and
wild
excess
they
have
gone
to
be
shot
down
in
battle
they
have
broken
life
and
thrown
it
away
like
an
empty
goblet
and
gone
like
wailing
ghosts
out
into
the
dread
unknown
the
possibility
of
all
this
lay
in
that
heart
which
had
just
received
that
stunning
blow
exercised
and
disciplined
as
he
had
been
by
years
of
sacrifice
by
constant
unsleeping
there
was
rising
there
in
that
great
heart
an
of
passion
and
for
a
while
his
cries
unto
god
seemed
as
empty
and
as
vague
as
the
screams
of
birds
tossed
and
buffeted
in
the
clouds
of
mighty
tempests
the
will
that
he
thought
wholly
subdued
seemed
to
rise
under
him
as
a
rebellious
giant
a
few
hours
before
he
thought
himself
established
in
an
invincible
submission
to
god
that
nothing
could
shake
now
he
looked
into
himself
as
into
a
seething
vortex
of
rebellion
and
against
all
the
passionate
cries
of
his
lower
nature
he
could
only
in
the
language
of
an
old
saint
cling
to
god
by
the
naked
force
of
his
that
will
was
as
determined
and
firm
as
that
of
aaron
burr
it
rested
unmelted
amid
the
boiling
sea
of
passion
waiting
its
hour
of
renewed
sway
he
walked
the
room
for
hours
and
then
sat
down
to
his
bible
and
wakened
once
or
twice
to
find
his
head
leaning
on
its
pages
and
his
mind
far
gone
in
thoughts
from
which
he
woke
with
a
bitter
throb
then
he
determined
to
set
himself
to
some
definite
work
and
taking
his
concordance
began
busily
tracing
out
and
numbering
all
the
for
one
of
the
chapters
of
his
theological
system
till
at
last
he
worked
himself
down
to
such
calmness
that
he
could
pray
and
then
he
schooled
and
reasoned
with
himself
in
a
style
not
unlike
in
its
spirit
to
what
a
great
modern
author
has
addressed
to
suffering
humanity
what
is
it
that
thou
art
fretting
and
about
is
it
because
art
not
happy
who
told
thee
that
thou
wast
to
be
happy
is
there
any
ordinance
of
the
universe
that
shouldst
be
happy
art
thou
nothing
but
a
vulture
screaming
for
prey
canst
thou
not
do
without
happiness
yea
thou
canst
do
without
happiness
and
instead
thereof
find
the
doctor
came
lastly
to
the
conclusion
that
which
was
all
the
portion
his
master
had
on
earth
might
do
for
him
also
and
therefore
he
kissed
and
blessed
that
silver
dove
of
happiness
which
he
saw
was
weary
of
sailing
in
his
clumsy
old
ark
and
let
it
go
out
of
his
hand
without
a
tear
he
slept
little
that
night
but
when
he
came
to
breakfast
all
noticed
an
unusual
gentleness
and
benignity
of
manner
and
mary
she
knew
not
why
saw
tears
rising
in
his
eyes
when
he
looked
at
her
after
breakfast
he
requested
scudder
to
step
with
him
into
his
study
and
miss
prissy
shook
in
her
little
shoes
as
she
saw
the
matron
entering
the
door
was
shut
for
a
long
time
and
two
voices
could
be
heard
in
earnest
conversation
meanwhile
james
marvyn
entered
the
cottage
prompt
to
remind
mary
of
her
promise
that
she
would
talk
with
him
again
this
morning
they
had
talked
with
each
other
but
a
few
moments
by
the
window
in
the
best
room
when
scudder
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
apartment
with
traces
of
tears
upon
her
cheeks
good
morning
james
she
said
the
doctor
wishes
to
see
you
and
mary
a
moment
both
looked
sufficiently
astounded
knowing
from
scudder
s
looks
that
something
was
impending
they
followed
scudder
scarcely
feeling
the
ground
they
trod
on
illustration
sampson
low
son
the
doctor
was
sitting
at
his
table
with
his
favourite
bible
open
before
him
he
rose
to
receive
them
with
a
manner
at
once
gentle
and
grave
there
was
a
pause
of
some
minutes
during
which
he
sat
with
his
head
leaning
upon
his
hand
you
all
know
he
said
turning
towards
mary
who
sat
very
near
him
the
near
and
dear
relation
in
which
i
have
been
expected
to
stand
towards
this
friend
i
should
not
have
been
worthy
of
that
relation
if
i
had
not
felt
in
my
heart
the
true
love
of
a
husband
as
set
forth
in
the
new
testament
who
should
love
his
wife
even
as
christ
loved
the
church
and
gave
himself
for
it
and
if
in
case
any
peril
or
danger
threatened
this
dear
soul
and
i
could
not
give
myself
for
her
i
had
never
been
worthy
the
honour
she
has
done
me
for
i
take
it
wherever
there
is
a
cross
or
burden
to
be
borne
by
one
or
the
other
that
the
man
who
is
made
in
the
image
of
god
as
to
strength
and
endurance
should
take
it
upon
himself
and
not
lay
it
upon
her
that
is
weaker
for
he
is
therefore
strong
not
that
he
may
tyrannize
over
the
weak
but
bear
their
burdens
for
them
even
as
christ
for
his
church
i
have
just
discovered
he
added
looking
kindly
upon
mary
that
there
is
a
great
cross
and
burden
which
must
come
either
on
this
dear
child
or
on
myself
through
no
fault
of
either
of
us
but
through
god
s
good
providence
and
therefore
let
bear
it
mary
my
dear
child
he
said
i
will
be
to
thee
as
a
father
but
i
will
not
force
thy
at
this
moment
mary
by
a
sudden
impulsive
movement
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
kissed
him
and
lay
sobbing
on
his
shoulder
no
no
she
said
i
will
marry
you
as
i
not
if
i
will
not
dear
he
said
with
a
benign
smile
come
here
young
man
he
said
with
some
authority
to
james
i
give
thee
this
maiden
to
wife
and
he
lifted
her
from
his
shoulder
and
placed
her
gently
in
the
arms
of
the
young
man
who
overawed
and
overcome
pressed
her
silently
to
his
heart
there
children
it
is
over
he
said
god
bless
you
take
her
away
he
added
she
will
be
more
composed
before
james
left
he
grasped
the
doctor
s
hand
in
his
and
said
sir
this
tells
on
my
heart
more
than
any
sermon
you
ever
preached
i
shall
never
forget
it
god
bless
you
sir
the
doctor
saw
them
slowly
quit
the
apartment
and
following
them
closed
the
door
and
thus
ended
the
minister
s
wooing
chapter
xli
of
the
events
which
followed
this
scene
we
are
happy
to
give
our
readers
more
minute
and
graphic
details
than
we
ourselves
could
furnish
by
transcribing
for
their
edification
an
autograph
letter
of
miss
prissy
s
still
preserved
in
a
black
oaken
cabinet
of
our
s
and
with
which
we
take
no
further
liberties
than
the
correction
of
a
somewhat
peculiar
orthography
it
is
written
to
that
sister
martha
in
boston
of
whom
she
made
such
frequent
mention
and
who
it
appears
it
was
her
custom
to
keep
posted
up
in
all
the
gossip
of
her
immediate
sphere
my
dear
sister
you
wonder
i
s
pose
why
i
haven
t
written
you
but
the
fact
is
i
ve
been
run
just
off
my
feet
and
worked
till
the
flesh
aches
so
it
seems
as
if
it
would
drop
off
my
bones
with
this
wedding
of
mary
scudder
s
and
after
all
you
ll
be
astonished
to
hear
that
she
ha
n
t
married
the
doctor
but
that
jim
marvyn
that
i
told
you
about
who
had
such
a
wonderful
escape
from
shipwreck
you
see
he
came
home
a
week
before
the
wedding
was
to
be
and
mary
she
was
so
conscientious
she
thought
twa
n
t
right
to
break
off
with
the
doctor
and
so
she
was
for
going
right
on
with
it
and
scudder
she
was
for
going
on
more
yet
and
the
poor
young
man
he
couldn
t
get
a
word
in
edgeways
and
there
wouldn
t
anybody
tell
the
doctor
a
word
about
it
and
there
twas
drifting
along
and
both
on
em
feeling
dreadfully
and
so
i
thought
to
myself
i
ll
just
take
my
life
in
my
hand
like
queen
esther
and
go
in
and
tell
the
doctor
all
about
it
and
so
i
did
i
m
scared
to
death
always
when
i
think
of
it
but
that
dear
blessed
man
he
took
it
like
a
saint
he
just
gave
her
up
as
serene
and
calm
as
a
and
called
james
in
and
told
him
to
take
her
jim
was
fairly
really
made
him
feel
small
and
he
says
he
ll
agree
that
there
is
more
in
the
doctor
s
religion
than
most
men
s
which
shows
how
important
it
is
for
professing
christians
to
bear
testimony
in
their
i
was
telling
cerinthy
ann
twitchel
and
she
said
there
wa
n
t
anything
made
her
want
to
be
a
christian
so
much
if
that
was
what
religion
would
do
for
people
well
you
see
when
this
came
out
it
wanted
just
three
days
of
the
wedding
which
was
to
be
thursday
and
that
i
told
you
about
that
had
lilies
of
the
valley
on
a
white
ground
was
pretty
much
made
except
puffing
the
gauze
round
the
neck
which
i
do
with
white
satin
piping
cord
and
it
looks
beautiful
too
and
so
scudder
and
i
we
were
thinking
twould
do
just
as
well
when
in
came
jim
marvyn
bringing
the
sweetest
thing
you
ever
saw
that
he
had
got
in
china
and
i
think
i
never
did
see
anything
lovelier
it
was
a
white
silk
as
thick
as
a
board
and
so
stiff
that
it
would
stand
alone
and
overshot
with
little
fine
dots
of
silver
so
that
it
shone
when
you
moved
it
just
like
and
when
i
saw
it
i
just
clapped
my
hands
and
jumped
up
from
the
floor
and
says
i
if
i
have
to
sit
up
all
night
that
dress
shall
be
made
and
made
well
for
you
know
i
thought
i
could
get
miss
ollodine
hocum
to
run
the
breadth
and
do
such
parts
so
that
i
could
devote
myself
to
the
fine
work
and
that
french
woman
i
told
you
about
she
said
she
d
help
and
she
s
a
for
touching
things
up
there
seems
to
be
work
provided
for
all
kinds
of
people
and
french
people
seem
to
have
a
gift
in
all
sorts
of
dressy
things
and
tisn
t
a
bad
gift
either
well
as
i
was
saying
we
agreed
that
this
was
to
be
cut
open
with
a
train
and
a
petticoat
of
just
the
palest
sweetest
loveliest
blue
that
ever
you
saw
and
gauze
puffings
down
the
edgings
each
side
fastened
in
every
once
in
a
while
with
lilies
of
the
valley
and
twas
cut
square
in
the
neck
with
puffing
and
flowers
to
match
and
then
tight
sleeves
with
full
ruffles
of
that
old
mechlin
lace
that
you
remember
katy
scudder
showed
you
once
in
that
great
trunk
well
you
see
come
to
get
all
things
together
that
were
to
be
done
we
concluded
to
put
off
the
wedding
till
tuesday
and
madame
de
frontignac
she
would
dress
the
best
room
for
it
herself
and
she
spent
nobody
knows
what
time
in
going
round
and
getting
evergreens
and
making
wreaths
and
putting
up
green
boughs
over
the
pictures
so
that
the
room
looked
just
like
the
episcopal
church
at
christmas
in
fact
scudder
said
if
it
had
been
christmas
she
wouldn
t
have
felt
it
right
because
it
would
be
like
encouraging
prelacy
but
as
it
was
she
didn
t
think
anybody
would
think
it
any
harm
well
tuesday
night
i
and
madame
de
frontignac
we
dressed
mary
ourselves
and
i
tell
you
the
dress
fitted
as
if
twas
grown
on
her
and
madame
de
frontignac
she
dressed
her
hair
and
she
had
on
a
wreath
of
lilies
of
the
valley
and
a
gauze
veil
that
came
a
most
down
to
her
feet
and
came
all
around
her
like
a
cloud
and
you
could
see
her
white
shining
dress
through
it
every
time
she
moved
and
she
looked
just
as
white
as
a
snowberry
but
there
were
two
little
pink
spots
that
came
coming
and
going
in
her
cheeks
that
kind
o
lightened
up
when
she
smiled
and
then
faded
down
again
and
the
french
lady
put
a
string
of
real
pearls
round
her
neck
with
a
cross
of
pearls
which
went
down
and
lay
hid
in
her
bosom
she
was
mighty
while
she
was
being
dressed
but
just
as
i
was
putting
in
the
last
pin
she
started
for
she
heard
the
rumbling
of
a
coach
down
stairs
for
jim
marvyn
had
got
a
real
elegant
carriage
to
carry
her
over
to
his
father
s
in
and
so
she
knew
he
was
come
and
pretty
soon
marvyn
came
in
the
room
and
when
she
saw
mary
her
brown
eyes
kind
o
danced
and
she
lifted
up
both
hands
to
see
how
beautiful
she
looked
and
jim
marvyn
he
was
standing
at
the
door
and
they
told
him
it
wasn
t
proper
that
he
should
see
till
the
time
come
but
he
begged
so
hard
that
he
might
just
have
one
peep
that
i
let
him
come
in
and
he
looked
at
her
as
if
she
was
something
he
wouldn
t
dare
to
touch
and
he
said
to
me
softly
says
he
i
m
most
afraid
she
has
got
wings
somewhere
that
will
fly
away
from
me
or
that
i
shall
wake
up
and
find
it
is
a
well
cerinthy
ann
twitchel
was
the
bridesmaid
and
she
came
next
with
that
young
man
she
is
engaged
to
it
is
all
out
now
that
she
is
engaged
and
she
don
t
deny
it
and
cerinthy
she
looked
handsomer
than
i
ever
saw
her
in
a
white
brocade
with
rosebuds
on
it
which
i
guess
she
got
in
reference
to
the
future
for
they
say
she
is
going
to
be
married
next
month
well
we
all
filled
up
the
room
pretty
well
till
scudder
came
in
to
tell
us
that
the
company
were
all
together
and
then
they
took
hold
of
arms
and
they
had
a
little
time
practising
how
they
must
stand
and
cerinthy
ann
s
beau
would
always
get
her
on
the
wrong
side
cause
he
s
rather
bashful
and
don
t
know
very
well
what
he
s
about
and
cerinthy
ann
declared
she
was
afraid
that
she
should
laugh
out
in
cause
she
always
did
laugh
when
she
knew
she
mus
n
t
but
finally
scudder
told
us
we
must
go
in
and
looked
so
reprovingly
at
cerinthy
that
she
had
to
hold
her
mouth
with
her
well
the
old
doctor
was
standing
there
in
the
very
silk
gown
that
the
ladies
gave
him
to
be
married
in
himself
poor
dear
man
and
he
smiled
kind
o
peaceful
on
em
when
they
came
in
and
walked
up
to
a
kind
o
bower
of
evergreens
and
flowers
that
madame
de
frontignac
had
fixed
for
them
to
stand
in
mary
grew
rather
white
as
if
she
was
going
to
faint
but
jim
marvyn
stood
up
just
as
firm
and
looked
as
proud
and
handsome
as
a
prince
and
he
kind
o
looked
down
at
her
cause
you
know
he
is
a
great
deal
taller
kind
o
wondering
as
if
he
wanted
to
know
if
it
was
really
so
well
when
they
got
all
placed
they
let
the
doors
stand
open
and
cato
and
candace
came
and
stood
in
the
door
and
candace
had
on
her
great
splendid
mogadore
turban
and
a
crimson
and
yellow
shawl
that
she
seemed
to
take
comfort
in
wearing
although
it
was
pretty
hot
well
so
when
they
were
all
fixed
the
doctor
he
began
his
prayer
and
as
most
all
of
us
knew
what
a
great
sacrifice
he
had
made
i
don
t
believe
there
was
a
dry
eye
in
the
room
and
when
he
had
done
there
was
a
great
blowing
their
noses
and
wiping
their
eyes
as
if
it
had
been
a
funeral
then
cerinthy
ann
she
pulled
off
mary
s
glove
pretty
quick
but
that
poor
beau
of
hers
he
made
such
work
of
james
s
that
he
had
to
pull
it
off
himself
after
all
and
cerinthy
ann
she
like
to
have
laughed
out
loud
and
so
when
the
doctor
told
them
to
join
hands
jim
took
hold
of
mary
s
hand
as
if
he
didn
t
mean
to
let
go
very
soon
and
so
they
were
married
and
i
was
the
first
one
that
kissed
the
bride
after
scudder
i
got
that
promise
out
of
mary
when
i
was
making
the
dress
and
jim
marvyn
he
insisted
upon
kissing
me
cause
says
he
miss
prissy
you
are
as
young
and
handsome
as
any
of
them
and
i
told
him
he
was
a
saucy
fellow
and
i
d
box
his
ears
if
i
could
reach
them
that
french
lady
looked
lovely
dressed
in
pale
pink
silk
with
long
pink
wreaths
of
flowers
in
her
hair
and
she
came
up
and
kissed
mary
and
said
something
to
her
in
french
and
after
a
while
old
candace
came
up
and
mary
kissed
her
and
then
candace
put
her
arms
round
jim
s
neck
and
gave
him
a
real
hearty
smack
so
that
everybody
laughed
and
then
the
cake
and
the
wine
was
passed
round
and
everybody
had
good
times
till
we
heard
the
clock
bell
ring
and
then
the
coach
came
up
to
the
door
and
scudder
she
wrapped
mary
up
kissing
her
and
crying
over
her
while
marvyn
stood
stretching
her
arms
out
of
the
coach
after
her
and
then
cato
and
candace
went
after
in
the
waggon
behind
and
so
they
all
went
off
together
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
wedding
and
ever
since
then
we
ha
n
t
any
of
us
done
much
but
rest
for
we
were
pretty
much
tired
out
so
no
more
at
present
from
your
affectionate
sister
prissy
to
miss
prissy
s
letter
forgot
to
tell
you
that
jim
marvyn
has
come
home
quite
rich
he
fell
in
with
a
man
in
china
who
was
at
the
head
of
one
of
their
great
whom
he
nursed
through
a
long
fever
and
took
care
of
his
business
and
so
when
he
got
well
nothing
would
do
but
he
must
have
him
for
a
partner
and
now
he
is
going
to
live
in
this
country
and
attend
to
the
business
of
the
house
here
they
say
he
is
going
to
build
a
house
as
grand
as
the
vernons
and
we
hope
he
has
experienced
religion
and
he
means
to
join
our
church
which
is
a
providence
for
he
is
twice
as
rich
and
generous
as
that
old
simon
brown
that
snapped
me
up
so
about
my
wages
i
never
believed
in
him
for
all
his
talk
i
was
down
to
miss
scudder
s
when
the
doctor
examined
jim
about
his
evidences
at
first
the
doctor
seemed
a
little
anxious
cause
he
didn
t
talk
in
the
regular
way
for
you
know
jim
always
did
have
his
own
way
of
talking
and
never
could
say
things
in
other
people
s
words
and
sometimes
he
makes
folks
laugh
when
he
himself
don
t
know
what
they
laugh
at
because
he
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
in
some
strange
way
they
ar
n
t
expecting
if
i
was
to
have
died
i
couldn
t
help
laughing
at
some
things
he
said
and
yet
i
don
t
think
i
ever
felt
more
solemnized
he
sat
up
there
in
a
sort
o
grand
straightforward
noble
way
and
told
us
all
the
way
the
lord
had
been
leading
of
him
and
all
the
exercises
of
his
mind
and
all
about
the
dreadful
shipwreck
and
how
he
was
saved
and
the
of
the
lord
till
the
doctor
s
spectacles
got
all
blinded
with
tears
and
he
couldn
t
see
the
notes
he
made
to
examine
him
by
and
we
all
cried
miss
scudder
and
mary
and
i
and
as
to
miss
marvyn
she
just
sat
with
her
hands
clasped
looking
into
her
son
s
eyes
like
a
picture
of
the
virgin
mary
and
when
jim
got
through
there
wa
n
t
nothing
to
be
heard
for
some
minutes
and
the
doctor
he
wiped
his
eyes
and
wiped
his
glasses
and
he
looked
over
his
papers
but
he
couldn
t
bring
out
a
word
and
at
last
says
he
let
us
pray
for
that
was
all
there
was
to
be
said
for
i
think
sometimes
things
so
kind
o
fills
folks
up
that
there
a
n
t
nothin
to
be
done
but
pray
which
the
lord
be
praised
we
are
privileged
to
do
always
between
you
and
i
martha
i
never
could
understand
all
the
distinctions
our
dear
blessed
doctor
sets
up
and
when
he
publishes
his
system
if
i
work
my
fingers
to
the
bone
i
mean
to
buy
one
and
study
it
out
because
he
is
such
a
blessed
man
though
after
all
s
said
i
have
to
come
back
to
my
old
place
and
trust
in
the
of
the
lord
who
takes
care
of
the
sparrow
on
the
and
all
small
lone
creatures
like
me
though
i
can
t
say
i
m
lone
either
because
nobody
need
say
that
so
long
as
there
s
folks
to
be
done
for
so
if
i
understand
the
doctor
s
theology
or
don
t
get
eyes
to
read
it
on
account
of
the
fine
stitching
on
his
shirt
ruffles
i
ve
been
trying
to
do
still
i
hope
i
may
be
accepted
on
account
of
the
lord
s
great
goodness
for
if
we
can
t
trust
that
it
s
all
over
with
us
chapter
xlii
last
words
we
know
it
is
fashionable
to
drop
the
curtain
over
a
pair
as
they
recede
from
the
altar
but
we
can
not
but
hope
our
readers
may
have
by
this
time
enough
of
interest
in
our
little
history
to
wish
for
a
few
words
on
the
lot
of
the
personages
whose
acquaintance
they
have
thereby
made
the
conjectures
of
miss
prissy
in
regard
to
the
house
which
was
to
be
built
for
the
pair
were
as
speedily
as
possible
realized
on
a
beautiful
elevation
a
little
out
of
the
town
of
newport
rose
a
fair
and
stately
mansion
whose
windows
overlooked
the
harbour
and
whose
wide
cool
rooms
were
adorned
by
the
constant
presence
of
the
sweet
face
and
form
which
has
been
the
of
our
story
the
fair
poetic
maiden
the
seeress
the
saint
has
passed
into
that
appointed
shrine
for
woman
more
holy
than
cloister
more
saintly
and
pure
than
church
or
christian
priestess
wife
and
mother
there
she
ministers
daily
in
holy
works
of
household
peace
and
by
faith
and
prayer
and
love
redeems
from
grossness
and
earthliness
the
common
toils
and
wants
of
life
the
gentle
guiding
force
that
led
james
marvyn
from
the
maxims
and
habits
and
ways
of
this
world
to
the
higher
conception
of
an
heroic
and
manhood
was
still
ever
present
with
him
gently
touching
the
springs
of
life
brooding
peacefully
with
wings
over
his
soul
and
he
grew
up
under
it
noble
in
purpose
and
strong
in
spirit
he
was
one
of
the
most
energetic
and
fearless
supporters
of
the
doctor
in
his
warfare
against
an
inhumanity
which
was
entrenched
in
all
the
mercantile
interest
of
the
day
and
which
at
last
fell
before
the
force
of
conscience
and
moral
appeal
candace
in
time
transferred
her
allegiance
to
the
growing
family
of
her
young
master
and
mistress
and
predominated
proudly
in
gorgeous
raiment
and
butterfly
turban
over
a
rising
race
of
young
marvyns
all
the
cares
not
needed
by
them
were
bestowed
on
the
somewhat
garrulous
old
age
of
cato
whose
cough
furnished
occupation
for
all
her
spare
hours
and
thought
as
for
our
friend
the
doctor
we
trust
our
readers
will
appreciate
the
magnanimity
with
which
he
proved
a
real
and
disinterested
love
in
a
point
where
so
many
men
experience
only
the
graspings
of
a
selfish
one
a
mind
so
severely
trained
as
his
had
been
brings
to
a
great
crisis
involving
severe
an
amount
of
reserved
moral
force
quite
inexplicable
to
those
less
habituated
to
he
was
like
a
warrior
whose
sleep
even
was
in
armour
always
ready
to
be
roused
to
the
conflict
in
regard
to
his
feelings
for
mary
he
made
the
sacrifice
of
himself
to
her
happiness
so
wholly
and
thoroughly
that
there
was
not
a
moment
of
weak
going
back
over
the
vain
regret
generous
and
brave
souls
find
a
support
in
such
actions
because
the
very
exertion
raises
them
to
a
higher
and
purer
plane
of
existence
his
diary
records
the
event
only
in
these
very
calm
and
temperate
words
it
was
a
trial
to
trial
but
as
she
did
not
deceive
me
i
shall
never
lose
my
friendship
for
the
doctor
was
always
a
welcome
inmate
in
the
house
of
mary
and
james
as
a
friend
revered
and
dear
nor
did
he
want
in
time
a
hearthstone
of
his
own
where
a
bright
and
loving
face
made
him
daily
welcome
for
we
find
that
he
married
at
last
a
woman
of
a
fair
countenance
and
that
sons
and
daughters
grew
up
around
him
in
time
also
his
theological
system
was
published
in
that
day
it
was
customary
to
dedicate
new
or
important
works
to
the
patronage
of
some
distinguished
or
powerful
individual
the
doctor
had
no
earthly
patron
four
or
five
simple
lines
are
found
in
the
commencement
of
his
work
in
which
in
a
spirit
reverential
and
affectionate
he
dedicates
it
to
our
lord
jesus
christ
praying
him
to
accept
the
good
and
to
overrule
the
errors
to
his
glory
quite
unexpectedly
to
himself
the
work
proved
a
success
not
only
in
public
acceptance
and
esteem
but
even
in
a
temporal
view
bringing
to
him
at
last
a
modest
competence
which
he
accepted
with
surprise
and
gratitude
to
the
last
of
a
very
long
life
he
was
the
same
steady
undiscouraged
worker
the
same
calm
witness
against
popular
sins
and
proclaimer
of
unpopular
truths
ever
saying
and
doing
what
he
saw
to
be
eternally
true
and
right
without
the
slightest
consultation
with
worldly
expediency
or
earthly
gain
nor
did
his
words
cease
to
work
in
new
england
till
the
evils
he
opposed
were
finally
done
away
colonel
burr
leaves
the
scene
of
our
story
to
pursue
those
brilliant
and
unscrupulous
political
intrigues
so
well
known
to
the
historian
of
those
times
and
whose
results
were
so
disastrous
to
himself
his
duel
with
the
hamilton
and
the
awful
retribution
of
public
opinion
that
slow
downward
course
of
a
doomed
life
are
all
on
record
chased
from
society
pointed
at
everywhere
by
the
finger
of
hatred
so
accursed
in
common
esteem
that
even
the
publican
who
lodged
him
for
a
night
refused
to
accept
his
money
when
he
knew
his
name
in
his
domestic
relation
his
only
daughter
taken
by
pirates
and
dying
in
untold
horrors
seems
to
see
in
a
doom
so
much
above
that
of
other
men
the
power
of
an
avenging
nemesis
for
sins
beyond
those
of
ordinary
humanity
but
we
who
have
learned
of
christ
may
humbly
hope
that
these
crushing
miseries
in
this
life
came
not
because
he
was
a
sinner
above
others
not
in
wrath
alone
but
that
the
prayers
of
the
sweet
saint
who
gave
him
to
god
even
before
his
birth
brought
to
him
those
friendly
adversities
that
thus
might
be
slain
in
his
soul
the
evil
demon
of
pride
which
had
been
the
opposing
force
to
all
that
was
noble
within
him
nothing
is
more
affecting
than
the
account
of
the
last
hours
of
this
man
whom
a
woman
took
in
and
cherished
in
his
poverty
and
weakness
with
that
same
heroic
enthusiasm
with
which
it
was
his
lot
to
inspire
so
many
women
this
humble
keeper
of
lodgings
was
told
that
if
she
retained
aaron
burr
all
her
other
lodgers
would
let
them
do
it
then
she
said
but
he
shall
in
the
same
uncomplaining
and
inscrutable
silence
in
which
he
had
borne
the
reverses
and
miseries
of
his
life
did
this
singular
being
pass
through
the
shades
of
the
dark
valley
the
new
testament
was
always
under
his
pillow
and
when
alone
he
was
often
found
reading
it
attentively
but
of
the
result
of
that
communion
with
higher
powers
he
said
nothing
patient
gentle
and
grateful
he
was
as
to
all
his
inner
history
entirely
silent
and
impenetrable
he
died
with
the
request
which
has
a
touching
significance
that
he
might
be
buried
at
the
feet
of
those
parents
whose
sainted
lives
had
finished
so
differently
from
his
own
no
farther
seek
his
errors
to
disclose
or
draw
his
frailties
from
their
dread
shortly
after
mary
s
marriage
madame
de
frontignac
sailed
with
her
husband
to
france
where
they
lived
in
a
very
retired
way
on
a
large
estate
in
the
south
of
france
a
close
correspondence
was
kept
up
between
her
and
mary
for
many
years
from
which
we
shall
give
our
readers
a
few
extracts
the
first
is
dated
shortly
after
their
return
to
france
at
last
my
sweet
marie
you
behold
us
in
peace
after
our
wanderings
i
wish
you
could
see
our
lovely
nest
in
the
hills
which
overlooks
the
mediterranean
whose
blue
waters
remind
me
of
newport
harbour
and
our
old
days
there
ah
my
sweet
saint
blessed
was
the
day
i
first
learned
to
know
you
for
it
was
you
more
than
anything
else
that
kept
me
back
from
sin
and
misery
i
call
you
my
sibyl
dearest
because
the
sibyl
was
a
prophetess
of
divine
things
out
of
the
church
and
so
are
you
the
abbé
says
that
all
true
devout
persons
in
all
persuasions
belong
to
the
true
catholic
apostolic
church
and
will
in
the
end
be
enlightened
to
know
it
what
do
you
think
of
that
i
fancy
i
see
you
look
at
me
with
your
grave
innocent
eyes
just
as
you
used
to
but
you
say
nothing
i
am
far
happier
marie
than
i
ever
thought
i
could
be
i
took
your
advice
and
told
my
husband
all
i
had
felt
and
suffered
it
was
a
very
hard
thing
to
do
but
i
felt
how
true
it
was
as
you
said
there
could
be
no
real
friendship
without
perfect
truth
at
bottom
so
i
told
him
all
and
he
was
very
good
and
noble
and
helpful
to
me
and
since
then
he
has
been
so
gentle
and
patient
and
thoughtful
that
no
mother
could
be
kinder
and
i
should
be
a
very
bad
woman
if
i
did
not
love
him
truly
and
do
i
must
confess
that
there
is
still
a
weak
bleeding
place
in
my
heart
that
aches
yet
but
i
try
to
bear
it
bravely
and
when
i
am
tempted
to
think
myself
very
miserable
i
remember
how
patiently
you
used
to
go
about
your
housework
and
spinning
in
those
sad
days
when
you
thought
your
heart
was
drowned
in
the
sea
and
i
try
to
do
like
you
i
have
many
duties
to
my
servants
and
tenants
and
mean
to
be
a
good
châtelaine
and
i
find
when
i
nurse
the
sick
and
comfort
the
poor
that
my
sorrows
seem
lighter
for
after
all
mary
i
have
lost
nothing
that
ever
was
my
foolish
heart
has
grown
to
something
that
it
should
not
and
bleeds
at
being
torn
away
nobody
but
christ
and
his
dear
mother
can
tell
what
this
sorrow
is
but
they
know
and
that
is
the
next
letter
is
dated
some
three
years
after
you
see
me
now
my
marie
a
proud
and
happy
woman
i
was
truly
envious
when
you
wrote
me
of
the
birth
of
your
little
son
but
now
the
dear
good
god
has
sent
a
sweet
little
angel
to
me
to
comfort
my
sorrows
and
lie
close
to
my
heart
and
since
he
came
all
pain
is
gone
ah
if
you
could
see
him
he
has
black
eyes
and
lashes
like
silk
and
such
little
hands
his
are
all
perfect
like
little
gems
and
when
he
puts
his
little
hand
on
my
bosom
i
tremble
with
joy
since
he
came
i
pray
always
and
the
good
god
seems
very
near
to
me
now
i
realize
as
i
never
did
before
the
sublime
thought
that
god
revealed
himself
in
the
infant
jesus
and
i
bow
before
the
manger
of
bethlehem
where
the
holy
babe
was
laid
what
comfort
what
adorable
condescension
for
us
mothers
in
that
scene
my
husband
is
so
moved
he
can
scarce
stay
an
hour
from
the
cradle
he
seems
to
look
at
me
with
a
sort
of
awe
because
i
know
how
to
care
for
this
precious
treasure
that
he
adores
without
daring
to
touch
we
are
going
to
call
him
henri
which
is
my
husband
s
name
and
that
of
his
ancestors
for
many
generations
back
i
vow
for
him
an
eternal
friendship
with
the
son
of
my
little
marie
and
i
shall
try
and
train
him
up
to
be
a
brave
man
and
a
true
christian
ah
marie
this
gives
me
something
to
live
for
my
heart
is
whole
new
life
opens
before
me
somewhat
later
another
letter
announces
the
birth
of
a
daughter
and
later
still
that
of
another
son
but
we
shall
only
add
one
more
written
some
years
after
on
hearing
of
the
great
reverse
of
popular
feeling
towards
burr
subsequently
to
his
duel
with
the
hamilton
chère
letter
has
filled
me
with
grief
my
noble
henri
who
already
begins
to
talk
of
himself
as
my
protector
these
boys
feel
their
manhood
so
soon
saw
by
my
face
when
i
read
your
letter
that
something
pained
me
and
he
would
not
rest
till
i
told
him
something
about
it
ah
marie
how
thankful
i
then
felt
that
i
had
nothing
to
blush
for
before
my
son
how
thankful
for
those
dear
children
whose
little
hands
had
healed
all
the
morbid
places
of
my
heart
so
that
i
could
think
of
all
the
past
without
a
pang
i
told
henri
that
the
letter
brought
bad
news
of
an
old
friend
but
that
it
pained
me
to
speak
of
it
and
you
would
have
thought
by
the
grave
and
tender
way
he
talked
to
his
mamma
that
the
boy
was
an
experienced
man
of
forty
to
say
the
least
but
marie
how
unjust
is
the
world
how
unjust
both
in
praise
and
blame
poor
burr
was
the
petted
child
of
society
yesterday
she
doted
on
him
flattered
him
smiled
on
his
faults
and
let
him
do
what
he
would
without
reproof
she
flouts
and
scorns
and
scoffs
him
and
refuses
to
see
the
least
good
in
him
i
know
that
man
mary
and
i
know
that
sinful
as
he
may
be
before
infinite
purity
he
is
not
so
much
worse
than
all
the
other
men
of
his
time
have
i
not
been
in
america
i
know
jefferson
i
knew
poor
be
with
the
dead
neither
of
them
had
lives
that
could
bear
the
sort
of
trial
to
which
burr
s
is
subjected
when
every
secret
fault
failing
and
sin
is
dragged
out
and
held
up
without
mercy
what
man
can
stand
but
i
know
what
irritates
the
world
is
that
proud
disdainful
calm
which
will
neither
give
sigh
nor
tear
it
was
not
that
he
killed
poor
hamilton
but
that
he
never
seemed
to
care
ah
there
is
that
evil
demon
of
his
life
cold
stoical
pride
which
haunts
him
like
a
fate
but
i
know
he
feel
i
know
he
is
as
hard
at
heart
as
he
tries
to
be
i
have
seen
too
many
real
acts
of
pity
to
the
unfortunate
of
tenderness
to
the
weak
of
real
love
to
his
friends
to
believe
that
great
have
been
his
sins
against
our
sex
and
god
forbid
that
the
mother
of
children
should
speak
lightly
of
them
but
is
not
so
susceptible
a
temperament
and
so
singular
a
power
to
charm
as
he
possessed
to
be
taken
into
account
in
estimating
his
temptations
because
he
is
a
sinning
man
it
does
not
follow
that
he
is
a
demon
if
any
should
have
cause
to
think
bitterly
of
him
i
should
he
trifled
inexcusably
with
my
deepest
feelings
he
caused
me
years
of
conflict
and
anguish
such
as
he
little
knows
i
was
almost
shipwrecked
yet
i
will
still
say
to
the
last
that
what
i
loved
in
him
was
a
better
really
noble
and
good
however
concealed
and
perverted
by
pride
ambition
and
though
all
the
world
reject
him
i
still
have
faith
in
this
better
nature
and
prayers
that
he
may
be
led
right
at
last
there
is
at
least
one
heart
that
will
always
intercede
with
god
for
it
is
well
known
that
for
many
years
after
burr
s
death
the
odium
that
covered
his
name
was
so
great
that
no
monument
was
erected
lest
it
should
become
a
mark
for
popular
violence
subsequently
however
in
a
mysterious
manner
a
plain
granite
slab
marked
his
grave
by
whom
erected
has
been
never
known
it
was
placed
in
the
night
by
some
friendly
unknown
hand
a
labourer
in
the
vicinity
who
first
discovered
it
found
lying
near
the
spot

had
perhaps
been
used
