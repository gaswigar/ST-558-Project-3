now
they
sped
from
the
cave
of
chrysolites
by
another
passage
than
that
by
which
they
entered
it
and
nothing
but
the
light
of
the
sword
to
guide
them
by
that
light
shibli
bagarag
could
distinguish
glimmering
shapes
silent
and
to
the
right
and
the
left
of
them
their
visages
hidden
in
a
veil
of
heavy
webs
and
he
saw
what
seemed
in
the
dusk
broad
halls
halls
of
council
and
again
black
pools
and
black
groves
and
columns
of
crowded
porticoes
all
signs
of
an
underground
kingdom
they
came
to
some
steps
and
mounted
these
severally
coming
to
a
platform
in
the
middle
of
which
leapt
a
fountain
the
top
spray
of
it
touched
with
a
beam
of
earth
and
the
air
breathed
by
men
here
he
heard
the
youths
dabble
with
the
dark
waters
and
he
discerned
gulrevaz
tossing
it
in
her
two
hands
calling
koorookh
then
they
said
to
him
this
fountain
with
the
sword
o
master
of
the
event
so
he
stirred
the
fountain
and
the
whole
body
of
it
took
a
leap
toward
the
light
that
was
like
the
shoot
of
a
long
lance
of
silver
in
the
moon
rays
and
lo
in
its
place
the
ruffled
feathers
of
a
bird
then
the
seven
youths
and
the
princess
and
shibli
bagarag
got
up
under
its
feathers
like
a
brood
of
and
the
bird
winged
straight
up
as
doth
a
blinded
bee
ascending
and
passing
in
the
ascent
a
widening
succession
of
winding
terraces
till
he
observed
the
copper
sun
of
aklis
and
the
red
lands
below
it
thrice
in
the
exuberance
of
his
gladness
he
waved
the
sword
and
the
sun
lost
that
dulness
on
its
disk
and
took
a
bright
flame
and
threw
golden
arrows
everywhere
and
the
pastures
were
green
the
streams
clear
the
sands
sparkling
the
bird
flew
and
circled
and
hung
poised
a
moment
presently
descending
on
the
roof
of
the
palace
now
there
was
here
a
piece
of
solid
glass
propped
on
two
crossed
bars
of
gold
and
it
was
shaped
like
an
eye
and
might
have
been
taken
for
one
of
the
eyes
inhabiting
the
head
of
some
monstrous
genie
shibli
bagarag
ran
to
it
when
he
was
afoot
and
peered
through
it
surely
it
was
the
first
object
of
his
heart
that
he
beheld
noorna
his
betrothed
pale
on
the
pillar
she
with
her
head
between
her
hands
and
her
hair
scattered
by
the
storm
as
one
despairing
still
he
looked
and
he
save
swimming
round
the
pillar
that
monstrous
fish
with
its
sole
baleful
eye
which
had
gulped
them
both
in
the
closed
shell
of
magic
pearl
and
he
knew
the
fish
for
karaz
the
genie
their
enemy
then
he
turned
to
the
princess
with
an
imploring
voice
for
counsel
how
to
reach
her
and
bring
her
rescue
but
she
said
sword
is
in
thy
hands
none
of
us
dare
wield
it
and
the
seven
youths
answered
likewise
so
left
to
himself
he
drew
the
sword
from
his
girdle
and
hissed
on
the
heads
of
the
serpents
at
the
same
time
holding
it
so
that
it
might
lengthen
out
inimitably
then
he
leaned
it
over
the
eye
of
the
glass
in
the
direction
of
the
pillar
besieged
by
the
billows
and
lo
with
one
cut
even
at
that
distance
he
divided
the
fishy
monster
and
with
another
severed
the
chains
that
had
fettered
noorna
and
she
arose
and
smiled
blissfully
to
the
sky
and
stood
upright
and
signalled
him
to
lay
the
point
of
the
blade
on
the
pillar
when
he
had
done
this
knowing
her
wisdom
she
put
a
foot
boldly
upon
the
blade
and
ran
up
it
toward
him
and
she
was
up
the
blade
when
suddenly
a
kite
darted
down
upon
her
pecking
at
her
eyes
to
confuse
her
she
waxed
unsteady
and
swayed
this
way
and
that
balancing
with
one
arm
and
defending
herself
from
the
attacks
of
the
kite
with
another
it
seemed
to
shibli
bagarag
she
must
fall
and
be
lost
and
the
sweat
started
on
his
forehead
in
great
drops
big
as
nuts
seeing
that
and
the
agitation
of
his
limbs
gulrevaz
cried
master
of
the
event
let
us
hear
it
but
he
shrieked
kite
the
kite
she
is
running
up
the
blade
and
the
kite
is
at
her
eyes
and
she
swaying
swaying
falling
falling
so
the
princess
exclaimed
kite
koorookh
is
match
for
a
kite
then
she
smoothed
the
throat
of
koorookh
and
clasped
round
it
a
collar
of
bright
steel
roughened
with
secret
characters
and
she
took
a
hoop
of
gold
and
passed
the
bird
through
it
urging
it
all
the
while
with
one
strange
syllable
and
the
bird
went
up
with
a
strong
whirr
of
the
wing
till
he
was
over
the
sea
and
caught
sight
of
noorna
tottering
beneath
him
on
the
blade
and
the
kite
pecking
fiercely
at
her
thereat
he
fluttered
eagerly
a
twinkle
of
time
and
the
next
was
down
with
his
beak
in
the
neck
of
the
kite
crimsoned
in
it
now
by
the
shouts
and
exclamations
of
shibli
bagarag
the
princess
and
the
seven
youths
her
brothers
knew
that
the
bird
had
performed
well
his
task
and
that
the
fight
was
between
koorookh
and
the
kite
then
he
cried
gladly
to
them
for
us
and
allah
be
praised
the
kite
is
dropping
and
she
leaneth
on
one
wing
of
koorookh
and
he
cried
in
anguish
see
i
the
kite
is
become
a
white
ball
rolling
down
the
blade
toward
her
and
it
will
of
a
surety
destroy
her
and
he
called
to
her
thinking
vainly
his
voice
might
reach
her
so
the
princess
said
white
ball
is
i
that
am
match
for
a
white
ball
now
she
seized
from
the
corner
of
the
a
bow
and
an
arrow
and
her
brothers
lifted
her
to
a
level
with
the
hilt
of
the
sword
leaning
on
the
eye
of
glass
then
she
planted
one
foot
on
the
shoulder
of
shibli
bagarag
as
he
bent
peering
through
the
eye
and
fitted
the
arrow
to
a
level
of
the
sword
slanting
its
slant
and
let
it
fly
doubling
the
bow
shibli
bagarag
saw
the
ball
roll
to
within
a
foot
of
noorna
when
it
was
as
if
stricken
by
a
gleam
of
light
and
burst
and
was
a
black
cloud
veined
with
fire
swathing
her
in
folds
he
lost
all
sight
of
noorna
and
where
she
had
been
were
vivid
flashes
and
then
a
great
flame
and
in
the
midst
a
red
serpent
and
a
green
serpent
twisted
as
in
the
so
he
cried
red
serpent
and
a
green
serpent
and
the
sons
of
aklis
exclaimed
red
serpent
is
we
that
are
match
for
a
red
serpent
thereupon
they
descended
steps
through
the
palace
roof
and
while
the
fight
between
those
two
serpents
was
rageing
shibli
bagarag
beheld
seven
small
bright
birds
that
entered
the
flame
bearing
in
their
bills
slips
of
a
herb
and
hovering
about
the
heal
of
the
red
serpent
distracting
it
then
he
saw
the
red
serpent
hiss
and
snap
at
one
darting
out
its
tongue
and
lo
on
the
fork
of
its
tongue
the
little
bird
let
fall
the
slip
of
herb
in
its
bill
and
in
an
instant
the
serpent
changed
from
red
to
yellow
and
from
yellow
to
blue
and
from
that
to
a
speckled
writhing
at
every
change
and
hissing
fire
from
its
open
jaws
meantime
the
green
serpent
was
released
and
was
making
circles
round
the
flame
seeking
to
complete
some
enchantment
when
suddenly
the
whole
scene
vanished
and
shibli
bagarag
again
beheld
noorna
steadying
her
steps
on
the
blade
and
leaning
on
one
wing
of
koorookh
she
advanced
up
the
blade
coming
nearer
and
nearer
and
he
thought
her
close
and
breathed
quick
and
ceased
looking
through
the
glass
when
he
gazed
abroad
lo
she
was
with
koorookh
on
a
far
hill
beyond
the
stream
in
outer
aklis
so
he
said
to
the
princess
gulrevaz
princess
comes
she
not
to
me
here
in
the
palace
but
the
princess
shook
her
head
and
said
hath
not
a
spell
she
waiteth
for
thee
yonder
with
koorookh
now
look
through
the
glass
once
more
he
looked
through
the
glass
and
there
on
a
plain
as
he
had
first
seen
it
when
noorna
appeared
to
him
was
the
city
of
shagpat
and
in
the
streets
of
the
city
a
vast
assembly
and
a
procession
passing
on
its
front
banner
surmounted
by
the
crescent
and
bands
with
curled
and
curved
instruments
playing
and
slaves
scattering
gold
and
clashing
cymbals
every
demonstration
and
evidence
of
a
great
day
and
a
high
occasion
in
the
city
of
shagpat
so
he
peered
yet
keenlier
through
the
glass
and
behold
the
vizier
feshnavat
father
of
noorna
walking
in
fetters
subject
to
the
jibes
and
of
the
crowds
of
people
his
turban
off
and
he
in
a
robe
of
stuff
in
the
scorned
condition
of
an
unbeliever
shibli
bagarag
peered
yet
more
earnestly
through
the
glass
eye
and
in
the
centre
of
the
procession
clad
gorgeously
in
silks
and
stuffs
woven
with
gold
and
gems
a
crown
upon
his
head
and
the
appanages
of
supremacy
and
majesty
about
him
was
shagpat
he
paced
upon
a
yellow
flooring
that
was
unrolled
before
him
from
a
mighty
roll
and
there
were
slaves
that
swarmed
on
all
sides
of
him
supporting
upon
gold
pans
and
platters
the
masses
of
hair
that
spread
bushily
before
and
behind
and
to
the
right
and
left
of
him
truly
the
gravity
of
his
demeanour
exceeded
that
which
is
attained
by
sheiks
and
dervishes
after
much
drinking
of
the
waters
of
wisdom
and
fasting
and
abnegation
of
the
pleasures
that
betray
us
to
folly
in
this
world
now
when
he
saw
shagpat
the
soul
of
shibli
bagarag
was
quickened
to
do
his
appointed
work
upon
him
shear
him
and
release
the
vizier
feshnavat
desire
to
shave
shagpat
was
as
a
salt
thirst
rageing
in
him
as
the
dream
of
munching
to
one
that
starveth
even
as
the
impelling
of
violent
tempests
to
skiffs
on
the
sea
and
he
hungered
to
be
at
him
crying
as
he
peered
he
even
he
shagpat
then
he
turned
to
the
princess
gulrevaz
and
said
shagpat
exalted
clothed
with
majesty
o
thou
morning
star
of
aklis
she
said
is
given
thee
and
waiteth
to
carry
ye
both
and
for
me
i
will
watch
that
this
glass
send
forth
a
beam
to
light
ye
to
that
city
so
farewell
o
thou
that
art
loved
and
delay
in
nothing
to
finish
the
work
in
hand
now
when
he
had
set
his
face
from
the
princess
he
descended
through
the
roof
of
the
palace
and
met
the
seven
youths
returning
and
they
accompanied
him
through
the
halls
of
the
palace
to
that
hall
where
the
damsels
had
duped
him
he
was
mindful
of
his
promise
to
the
old
man
crowned
and
flashed
the
sword
a
strong
flash
so
that
he
who
looked
on
it
would
be
seared
in
the
eyelashes
then
the
doors
of
the
recesses
flew
apart
in
number
and
he
beheld
divers
sitters
on
thrones
with
the
diadem
of
asses
ears
stiffened
upright
and
skulls
grinning
with
gems
they
having
on
each
countenance
the
look
of
sovereigns
and
the
serenity
of
high
estate
shibli
bagarag
laughed
at
them
and
he
thought
was
i
one
of
these
i
the
beloved
of
noorna
destined
master
of
the
event
and
he
thought
a
surety
if
these
sitters
could
but
laugh
at
themselves
there
would
be
a
release
for
them
and
the
crown
would
topple
off
which
getteth
the
homage
of
asses
and
monkeys
he
would
have
spoken
to
them
but
the
sons
of
aklis
said
have
seen
the
flashing
of
the
sword
and
well
they
wake
not
as
they
went
from
the
hall
the
seven
youths
said
upon
the
age
of
these
sitters
that
have
been
sitting
in
the
chairs
from
three
to
eleven
generations
back
and
they
were
searchers
of
the
sword
like
thee
but
were
duped
in
like
manner
the
hen
sitteth
in
complacency
but
she
bringeth
forth
and
may
cackle
is
owing
to
the
aids
of
noorna
that
thou
art
not
one
of
these
sitters
o
master
of
the
event
now
they
paced
through
the
hall
of
dainty
provender
and
through
the
hall
of
the
coming
to
the
palace
steps
where
stood
abarak
leaning
on
his
bar
as
they
advanced
to
abarak
there
was
a
clamour
in
the
halls
behind
that
gathered
in
noise
like
a
torrent
and
approached
and
presently
the
master
was
ware
of
a
sharp
stroke
on
his
forehead
with
a
hairy
finger
and
then
a
burn
and
the
crown
that
had
clung
to
him
toppled
off
surely
it
fell
upon
the
head
of
the
old
monkey
the
cautious
and
wise
one
he
that
had
made
a
study
of
shibli
bagarag
thereupon
that
monkey
stalked
scornfully
from
them
and
abarak
cried
master
of
the
event
it
was
better
for
me
to
keep
the
passage
of
the
seventh
pillar
than
be
an
ape
of
this
order
wah
the
flashing
of
the
sword
scorcheth
them
and
they
scamper
the
veiled
figure
verily
there
was
lightning
in
aklis
as
shibli
bagarag
flashed
the
sword
over
the
clamouring
beasts
the
shape
of
the
great
palace
stood
forth
vividly
and
a
wide
illumination
struck
up
the
streams
and
gilded
the
large
hanging
leaves
and
drew
the
hills
glimmeringly
together
and
scattered
fires
on
the
flat
faces
of
the
rocks
then
the
seven
youths
said
quickly
out
of
aklis
o
master
of
the
event
from
city
to
city
of
earth
this
light
is
visible
and
men
will
know
that
fate
is
in
travail
and
an
event
preparing
for
them
and
shagpat
will
be
warned
by
the
portent
wherefore
lose
not
the
happy
point
of
time
on
which
thy
star
is
manifest
and
they
cried
again
out
of
aklis
with
gestures
of
impatience
urging
his
departure
then
said
he
youths
sons
of
aklis
it
is
written
that
gratitude
is
the
poor
man
mine
of
wealth
and
the
rich
man
flower
of
beauty
and
i
have
but
that
to
give
ye
for
all
this
aid
and
friendliness
of
yours
but
they
exclaimed
aid
or
friendliness
in
aklis
by
the
gall
of
the
roc
it
is
well
for
thee
thou
camest
armed
with
potent
spells
and
hadst
one
to
advise
and
inspirit
thee
or
thou
wouldst
have
stayed
here
to
people
aklis
and
grazed
in
a
strange
shape
now
the
seven
waxed
in
impatience
and
he
laid
their
hands
upon
his
head
and
moved
from
them
with
abarak
to
where
in
the
dusk
the
elephant
that
had
brought
them
stood
then
the
elephant
kneeled
and
took
the
twain
upon
his
back
and
bore
them
across
the
dark
land
to
that
reach
of
the
river
where
the
boat
was
moored
in
readiness
they
entered
the
boat
silently
among
its
drapery
of
lotuses
and
the
veiled
figure
ferried
them
over
the
stream
that
rippled
not
with
their
motion
as
they
were
crossing
desire
to
know
that
veiled
figure
counselled
shibli
bagarag
evilly
to
draw
the
sword
again
and
flash
it
so
that
the
veil
became
transparent
then
when
abarak
turned
to
him
for
the
reason
of
the
flashing
of
the
sword
he
beheld
the
eyes
of
the
youth
fixed
in
horror
glaring
as
at
sights
beyond
the
tomb
he
said
nought
but
as
the
head
whispered
among
the
reeds
and
long
flowers
of
the
opposite
marge
he
took
shibli
bagarag
by
the
shoulders
and
pushed
him
out
of
the
boat
and
leaped
out
likewise
leading
him
from
the
marge
forcibly
hurrying
him
forward
from
it
he
at
the
heels
of
the
youth
propelling
him
and
crying
in
voice
at
intervals
sight
what
sight
but
the
youth
was
powerless
of
speech
and
when
at
last
he
opened
his
lips
the
little
man
shrank
from
him
for
he
laughed
as
do
the
insane
a
peal
of
laughter
ended
by
gasps
then
a
louder
peal
presently
softer
then
a
peal
that
started
all
the
echoes
in
aklis
after
awhile
as
abarak
still
cried
in
his
ear
sight
he
looked
at
him
with
a
large
eye
saying
querulously
it
written
i
shall
be
pushed
by
the
shoulder
through
life
and
is
it
in
the
pursuit
of
further
thwackings
abarak
heeded
him
not
crying
still
sight
and
shibli
bagarag
lowered
his
tone
and
jerked
his
body
pronouncing
the
name
then
abarak
exclaimed
as
i
weened
oh
fool
to
flash
the
sword
and
peer
through
the
veil
truly
there
be
few
wits
will
bear
that
sight
on
a
sudden
he
cried
cure
but
one
and
that
a
sleep
in
the
bosom
of
the
betrothed
thereupon
he
hurried
the
youth
yet
faster
across
the
dark
lawns
of
aklis
toward
the
passage
of
the
seventh
pillar
by
which
the
twain
had
entered
that
kingdom
and
shibli
bagarag
saw
as
in
a
dream
the
shattered
door
shattered
by
the
bar
remembering
dimly
as
a
thing
distant
in
years
the
netting
of
the
queen
and
noorna
chained
upon
the
pillar
he
remembered
shagpat
even
vacantly
in
his
mind
as
one
sheaf
of
barley
amid
other
sheaves
of
the
bearded
field
so
was
he
overcome
by
the
awfulness
of
that
sight
behind
the
veil
of
the
veiled
figure
as
they
advanced
to
the
passage
he
was
aware
of
an
impediment
to
its
entrance
as
it
had
been
a
wall
of
stone
there
and
seeing
abarak
enter
the
passage
without
let
he
kicked
hard
in
front
at
the
invisible
obstruction
but
there
was
no
coming
by
abarak
returned
to
him
and
took
his
right
arm
and
raised
the
sleeve
from
his
wrist
and
lo
the
two
remaining
hairs
of
garraveen
twisted
round
it
in
sapphire
winds
cried
he
the
generosity
of
gulrevaz
she
has
left
these
two
hairs
that
he
may
accomplish
swiftly
the
destiny
marked
for
him
but
now
since
his
gazing
through
that
veil
he
must
part
with
them
to
get
out
of
aklis
and
he
muttered
star
is
a
strange
one
one
that
leadeth
him
to
fortune
by
the
path
of
frowns
to
greatness
by
the
aid
of
thwackings
truly
the
ways
of
allah
are
wonderful
shibli
bagarag
resisted
him
in
nothing
and
abarak
loosed
the
two
bright
hairs
from
his
wrist
and
those
two
hairs
swelled
and
took
glittering
scales
and
were
sapphire
snakes
with
wings
of
intense
emerald
and
they
rose
in
the
air
spirally
together
each
over
each
so
that
to
see
them
one
would
fancy
in
the
darkness
a
fountain
of
sapphire
waters
flashed
with
the
sheen
of
emerald
when
they
had
reached
a
height
loftier
than
the
topmost
of
aklis
they
descended
like
javelins
into
the
earth
and
in
a
moment
appeared
in
the
shape
of
genii
when
they
are
charitably
disposed
to
them
they
visit
not
much
above
the
mortal
size
nor
overbright
save
for
a
certain
fire
in
their
eyes
when
they
turned
them
and
they
were
clothed
each
from
head
to
foot
in
an
armour
of
sapphire
plates
shot
with
steely
emerald
surely
the
that
darteth
all
day
in
the
blaze
over
pools
is
like
what
they
were
abarak
bit
his
forefinger
and
said
be
ye
o
sons
of
brilliance
they
answered
and
veejravoosh
slaves
of
the
sword
then
he
said
with
us
now
o
slaves
of
the
sword
and
help
us
to
the
mountain
of
outer
aklis
they
answered
thou
there
be
but
two
means
for
us
of
quitting
aklis
on
the
wrist
of
the
master
or
down
the
blade
of
the
sword
and
from
the
wrist
of
the
master
we
have
been
loosed
and
no
one
of
thy
race
can
tie
us
to
it
again
abarak
said
then
shall
the
master
leave
aklis
they
answered
allah
in
aklis
he
can
carve
a
way
whither
he
will
with
the
sword
but
abarak
cried
karavejis
and
veejravoosh
he
bath
peered
through
the
veil
of
the
ferrying
figure
now
when
they
heard
his
words
the
visages
of
the
genii
darkened
and
they
exclaimed
sorrowfully
we
such
a
one
and
they
looked
at
shibli
bagarag
a
look
of
anger
so
that
he
whose
wits
were
in
past
occurrences
imagined
them
his
enemy
and
the
foe
of
noorna
split
in
two
crying
is
karaz
a
couple
and
do
i
multiply
him
with
strokes
of
the
sword
thereupon
he
drew
the
sword
from
his
girdle
in
wrath
flourishing
it
and
karavejis
and
veejravoosh
felt
the
might
of
the
sword
and
prostrated
themselves
to
the
ground
at
his
feet
and
abarak
said
and
bring
us
swiftly
to
the
mountain
of
outer
aklis
then
said
they
a
passage
down
yonder
brook
in
the
moonbeams
and
it
is
the
sole
passage
for
him
now
abarak
went
with
them
to
the
brook
that
was
making
watery
music
to
itself
between
banks
of
splintered
rock
and
over
broad
slabs
of
marble
bubbling
here
and
there
about
the
roots
of
and
catching
the
mirrored
moon
of
aklis
in
whirls
breaking
it
in
lances
then
they
waded
into
the
water
and
the
two
genii
seized
hold
of
a
great
slab
of
marble
in
the
middle
of
the
water
and
under
was
a
hollow
brimmed
with
the
brook
that
the
brook
partly
filled
and
flowed
over
then
the
genii
said
to
abarak
and
they
said
the
same
to
shibli
bagarag
the
swayer
of
the
sword
replied
as
it
had
been
a
simple
occasion
a
common
matter
and
a
thing
for
the
exercise
of
civility
pleasure
and
all
willingness
thereupon
he
tightened
his
girth
and
arrowing
his
two
hands
flung
up
his
heels
and
disappeared
in
the
depths
abarak
following
surely
those
two
went
diving
downward
till
it
seemed
to
each
there
was
no
bottom
in
the
depth
and
they
would
not
cease
to
feel
the
rushing
of
the
water
in
their
ears
till
the
time
anticipated
by
mortals
the
bosom
of
noorna
now
while
a
thousand
sparks
of
fire
were
bursting
on
the
sight
of
the
two
divers
and
they
speeded
heels
uppermost
to
the
destiny
marked
out
for
them
by
the
premeditations
of
the
lo
noorna
was
on
the
mountain
in
outer
aklis
with
koorookh
waiting
for
the
appearance
of
her
betrothed
sword
in
hand
she
saw
beams
from
the
blazing
eye
of
aklis
and
knew
by
the
redness
of
it
that
one
a
mortal
was
peering
on
the
earth
and
certain
of
created
things
so
she
waited
awhile
in
patience
for
the
return
of
her
betrothed
with
the
head
of
koorookh
in
her
lap
caressing
the
bird
and
teaching
it
words
of
our
language
and
the
bird
fashioned
its
bill
to
the
pronouncing
of
names
such
as
and
and
and
it
said
and
stuck
not
at
the
name
and
it
learnt
to
say
even
shall
be
shaved
shagpat
shall
be
shaved
but
no
effort
of
noorna
could
teach
it
to
say
bagarag
the
bird
calling
instead
shiplabarack
shibblisharack
and
noorna
chid
it
with
her
forefinger
crying
koorookh
wilt
thou
speak
all
names
but
that
one
of
my
betrothed
so
she
said
again
bagarag
and
the
bird
answered
imitating
its
best
noorna
was
wroth
with
it
crying
naughty
bird
is
the
name
of
my
beloved
hateful
to
thee
and
she
chid
koorookh
angrily
he
with
a
heavy
eye
sulking
and
keeping
the
sullen
feathers
close
upon
his
poll
now
she
thought
is
in
this
a
meaning
and
i
will
fathom
it
so
she
counted
the
letters
in
the
name
of
her
betrothed
that
were
thirteen
and
spelt
them
backwards
afterwards
multiplying
them
by
an
equal
number
and
fashioning
words
from
the
selection
of
every
third
and
seventh
letter
then
took
she
the
leaf
from
a
tree
and
bade
koorookh
fly
with
her
to
the
base
of
the
mountain
sloping
from
aklis
to
the
sea
and
there
wrote
with
a
pin
point
on
the
leaf
the
words
fashioned
dipping
the
leaf
in
the
salt
ripple
by
the
beach
till
they
were
distinctly
traced
and
it
was
revealed
to
her
that
shibli
bagarag
bore
now
a
name
that
might
be
uttered
by
none
for
that
the
bearer
of
it
had
peered
through
the
veil
of
the
ferrying
figure
in
aklis
when
she
knew
that
her
grief
was
heavy
and
she
sat
on
the
cold
stones
of
the
beach
and
among
the
bright
shells
weeping
in
anguish
loosing
her
hair
scattering
it
wildly
exclaiming
woe
on
me
was
ever
man
more
tired
than
he
before
entering
aklis
he
that
was
in
turns
abased
and
beloved
and
exalted
yet
his
weakness
clingeth
to
him
even
in
aklis
and
with
the
wondrous
sword
in
his
grasp
then
she
thought
he
had
strength
to
wield
the
sword
for
i
marked
the
flashing
of
it
and
was
he
that
leaned
forward
the
blade
to
me
and
he
possesses
the
qualities
that
bring
one
gloriously
to
the
fruits
of
enterprise
and
she
thought
a
surety
if
abarak
be
with
him
and
a
single
of
the
three
slaves
of
the
sword
that
i
released
from
the
tail
of
garraveen
ravejoura
karavejis
and
veejravoosh
he
will
yet
come
through
and
i
may
revive
him
in
my
bosom
for
the
task
so
thinking
upon
that
the
sweet
crimson
surprised
her
cheeks
and
she
arose
and
drew
koorookh
with
her
along
the
beach
till
they
came
to
some
rocks
piled
ruggedly
and
the
waves
breaking
over
them
she
mounted
these
and
stepped
across
them
to
the
entrance
of
a
cavern
where
flowed
a
full
water
swiftly
to
the
sea
rolling
smooth
bulks
over
and
over
and
with
a
translucent
light
in
each
showing
precious
pebbles
in
the
bed
of
the
water
below
agates
of
size
limpid
cornelians
plates
of
polished
jet
rubies
diamonds
innumerable
that
were
smitten
into
sheen
by
slant
rays
of
the
level
sun
the
sun
just
losing
its
circle
behind
lustrous
billows
of
that
enchanted
sea
she
turned
to
koorookh
a
moment
saying
with
a
coax
of
smiles
my
bird
wait
here
for
me
even
at
this
point
koorookh
clapped
both
his
wings
and
she
said
again
petting
him
will
keep
watch
to
pluck
me
from
the
force
of
water
as
i
roll
past
that
i
be
not
carried
to
the
sea
and
lost
koorookh
still
clapped
his
wings
and
she
entered
under
the
arch
of
the
cavern
it
was
roofed
with
crystals
a
sight
of
glory
with
golden
lamps
at
intervals
still
centres
of
a
thousand
beams
taking
the
sandal
from
her
left
foot
and
tucking
up
the
folds
of
her
trousers
to
the
bend
of
her
clear
white
knee
she
advanced
half
wading
up
the
winds
of
the
cavern
and
holding
by
the
juts
of
granite
here
and
there
till
she
came
to
a
long
straight
lane
in
the
cavern
and
at
the
end
of
it
far
down
a
solid
pillar
of
water
that
fell
into
the
current
as
it
had
been
one
block
of
gleaming
marble
from
the
roof
without
ceasing
now
she
made
toward
it
and
fixed
her
eye
warily
wide
on
it
and
it
was
bright
flawless
in
brilliancy
but
while
she
gazed
a
sudden
blot
was
visible
and
she
observed
in
the
body
of
the
fall
two
dark
objects
plumping
downward
one
after
the
other
like
bolts
and
they
splashed
in
the
current
and
were
carried
off
by
the
violence
of
its
full
sweep
shooting
by
her
where
she
stood
rapidly
but
she
knotting
her
garments
round
the
waist
to
give
her
limbs
freedom
and
swiftness
ran
a
space
and
then
bent
and
plunged
catching
as
she
rose
the
foremost
to
her
bosom
and
whirled
away
under
the
flashing
crystals
like
a
fish
scaled
with
splendours
that
hath
darted
and
seized
upon
a
prey
and
is
bearing
it
greedily
to
some
secure
corner
of
the
deeps
to
swallow
the
quivering
repast
at
leisure
surely
the
heart
of
noorna
was
wise
of
what
she
bore
against
her
bosom
and
it
beat
exulting
strokes
in
the
midst
of
the
rush
and
roar
and
gurgle
of
the
torrent
and
the
gulping
sounds
and
multitudinous
outcries
of
the
headlong
water
that
verse
of
the
poet
would
apply
to
her
where
he
says
lead
me
to
the
precipice
and
bid
me
leap
the
dark
abyss
i
care
not
what
the
danger
be
so
my
beloved
my
beauteous
vision
be
but
the
prize
i
bear
with
me
for
she
to
paradise
can
turn
perdition
praise
be
to
him
that
planteth
love
the
worker
of
this
marvel
within
us
now
she
sped
in
the
manner
narrated
through
the
mazes
of
the
cavern
coming
suddenly
to
the
point
at
the
entrance
where
perched
koorookh
gravely
upon
one
leg
like
a
bird
with
an
angling
beak
he
caught
at
her
as
she
was
hurling
toward
the
sea
and
drew
her
to
the
bank
of
rock
that
burden
on
her
bosom
and
it
was
shibli
bagarag
her
betrothed
his
eyes
closed
his
whole
countenance
colourless
behind
him
like
a
shadow
streamed
abarak
and
noorna
kneeled
by
the
waterside
and
fetched
the
little
man
from
it
likewise
he
was
without
a
change
as
if
drawn
from
a
familiar
element
and
when
he
had
prostrated
himself
thrice
and
called
on
the
prophet
name
in
the
form
of
thanksgiving
he
wrung
his
beard
of
the
wet
and
had
wit
to
bless
the
action
of
noorna
that
saved
him
then
the
two
raised
shibli
bagarag
from
the
rock
and
reclined
him
lengthwise
under
the
wings
of
koorookh
and
noorna
stretched
herself
there
beside
him
with
one
arm
about
his
neck
the
fair
head
of
the
youth
on
her
bosom
and
she
said
to
abarak
hath
dreamed
many
dreams
my
betrothed
but
never
one
so
sweet
as
that
i
give
him
already
see
the
hue
returneth
to
his
cheek
and
the
dimples
of
pleasure
so
was
it
and
she
said
o
thou
of
the
net
and
the
bar
and
stride
koorookh
across
the
neck
for
it
is
nigh
the
setting
of
the
moon
and
by
dawn
we
must
be
in
our
middle
flight
seen
of
men
a
cloud
over
them
said
abarak
hear
is
to
obey
he
bestrode
the
neck
of
koorookh
and
sat
with
dangling
feet
till
she
cried
and
the
bird
spread
its
wings
and
flapped
them
wide
rising
high
in
the
silver
rays
and
flying
rapidly
forward
with
the
three
on
him
from
the
mountain
in
front
of
aklis
and
the
white
sea
with
its
enchanted
isles
and
wonders
flying
and
soaring
till
the
earth
was
as
what
might
be
held
in
the
hollow
of
the
hand
and
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
a
mingled
heap
of
shining
dust
in
the
midst
the
revival
now
the
feathers
of
koorookh
in
his
flight
were
ruffled
by
a
chill
breeze
and
they
were
speeding
through
a
light
glow
of
cold
then
said
noorna
the
messenger
of
morning
the
blush
oh
what
changes
will
date
from
this
day
the
glow
of
rose
became
golden
and
they
beheld
underneath
them
on
one
side
the
rim
of
the
rising
red
sun
and
rays
streaming
over
the
earth
and
its
waters
and
noorna
said
must
warn
feshnavat
my
father
and
prepare
him
for
our
coming
so
she
plucked
a
feather
from
koorookh
and
laid
the
quill
downward
letting
it
drop
then
said
she
for
the
awakening
of
my
betrothed
thereupon
she
hugged
his
head
a
moment
and
kissed
him
on
the
eyelids
the
cheeks
and
the
lips
crying
this
means
only
crying
that
she
pushed
him
sliding
from
the
back
of
the
bird
and
he
parted
from
them
falling
headforemost
in
the
air
like
a
stricken
eagle
then
she
called
to
koorookh
him
and
the
bird
slanted
his
beak
and
closed
his
wings
the
two
abarak
and
noorna
clinging
to
him
tightly
and
he
was
down
like
an
arrow
between
shibli
bagarag
and
the
ground
spreading
beneath
him
like
a
tent
and
noorna
caught
the
youth
gently
to
her
lap
then
she
pushed
him
off
again
intercepting
his
descent
once
more
till
they
were
on
a
level
with
one
of
the
mountains
of
the
earth
from
which
the
city
of
shagpat
is
visible
among
the
yellow
sands
like
a
white
spot
in
the
yolk
of
an
egg
so
by
this
time
the
eyes
of
the
youth
gave
symptoms
of
a
desire
to
look
upon
the
things
that
be
peeping
faintly
beneath
the
lashes
and
she
exclaimed
joyfully
raising
her
white
hands
above
her
head
plunge
in
the
lake
and
life
will
be
his
again
below
them
was
a
green
lake
tinted
by
the
dawn
with
crimson
and
yellow
deep
and
with
high
banks
as
they
crossed
it
to
the
middle
she
slipped
off
the
youth
from
koorookh
and
he
with
a
great
plunge
was
received
into
the
stillness
of
the
lake
meanwhile
koorookh
quivered
his
wings
and
seized
him
when
he
arose
bearing
him
to
an
end
of
the
lake
where
stood
one
dressed
like
a
dervish
and
it
was
the
vizier
feshnavat
the
father
of
noorna
so
when
he
saw
them
he
shouted
the
shout
of
congratulation
catching
noorna
to
his
breast
and
shibli
bagarag
stretched
as
doth
a
heavy
sleeper
in
his
last
doze
saying
in
a
yawning
voice
trouble
i
wot
there
is
nought
more
for
us
now
that
shagpat
is
shaved
oh
i
have
had
a
dream
a
dream
he
that
is
among
houris
in
paradise
dreameth
not
a
dream
like
that
and
i
dreamed
is
gone
then
said
he
staring
at
them
be
ye
what
is
this
noorna
took
him
again
to
her
bosom
and
held
him
there
and
she
plucked
a
herb
and
squeezed
it
till
a
drop
from
it
fell
on
either
of
his
lids
applying
to
them
likewise
a
dew
from
the
serpents
of
the
sword
and
he
awoke
to
the
reality
of
things
surely
then
he
prostrated
himself
and
repeated
the
articles
of
his
faith
taking
one
hand
of
his
betrothed
and
kissing
her
and
he
embraced
abarak
and
feshnavat
saying
to
the
father
of
noorna
know
o
feshnavat
that
by
my
folly
and
through
my
weakness
i
have
lost
time
in
this
undertaking
but
it
shall
be
short
work
now
with
shagpat
this
thy
daughter
the
eclipser
of
reason
was
ever
such
a
prize
as
she
i
will
deserve
her
wullahy
i
am
now
a
new
man
sprung
like
fire
from
ashes
lo
i
am
revived
by
her
for
the
great
work
said
abarak
master
of
the
event
secure
now
without
delay
the
two
slaves
of
the
sword
and
lean
the
blade
toward
aklis
upon
that
he
ran
up
rapidly
to
the
summit
of
the
mountain
and
drew
the
sword
from
his
girdle
and
leaned
it
toward
aklis
and
it
lengthened
out
over
lands
the
blade
of
it
a
beam
of
solid
brilliance
presently
from
forth
the
invisible
remoteness
they
saw
the
two
genii
karavejis
and
veejravoosh
and
they
were
footing
the
blade
swiftly
like
stars
speeding
up
till
they
were
within
reach
of
the
serpents
of
the
hilt
when
they
dropped
to
the
earth
bowing
their
heads
so
he
commanded
them
to
rise
crying
ye
the
earth
and
its
confines
and
bring
hither
tidings
of
the
genie
karaz
they
said
hear
is
to
obey
then
they
began
to
circle
each
round
the
other
circling
more
and
more
sharply
till
beyond
the
stretch
of
sight
and
shibli
bagarag
said
to
feshnavat
i
not
awake
o
feshnavat
i
will
know
where
is
karaz
ere
i
seek
to
operate
on
shagpat
for
it
is
well
spoken
of
the
poet
obstructions
first
remove
ere
thou
thy
cunning
prove
and
i
will
encounter
this
karaz
that
was
our
ass
ere
i
try
the
great
shave
then
said
he
turning
quickly
is
the
light
from
aklis
striking
on
the
city
and
i
mark
shagpat
even
he
illumined
by
it
singled
out
where
he
sitteth
on
the
roof
of
the
palace
by
the
so
they
looked
and
it
was
as
he
had
spoken
that
shagpat
was
singled
out
in
the
midst
of
the
city
by
the
wondrous
beams
of
the
eye
of
aklis
and
made
prominent
in
effulgence
said
abarak
climbing
to
the
level
of
observation
hath
a
redness
like
the
inside
of
a
halved
pomegranate
feshnavat
stroked
his
chin
exclaiming
may
be
likened
to
a
mountain
goat
in
the
midst
of
a
forest
roaring
with
conflagration
said
shibli
bagarag
is
he
the
lion
the
bristling
boar
the
uncombed
buffalo
the
plumaged
cock
but
soon
will
he
be
like
nothing
else
save
the
wrinkled
kernel
of
a
shaggy
fruit
lo
now
the
sword
it
leapeth
to
be
at
him
and
be
as
the
keen
icicle
of
winter
to
that
perishing
foliage
that
doomed
crop
so
doth
the
destined
minute
destroy
with
a
flash
the
hoarded
arrogance
of
ages
and
the
destined
hand
doeth
what
creation
failed
to
perform
and
is
by
order
destiny
and
preordainment
that
the
works
of
this
world
come
to
pass
this
know
i
and
i
witness
thereto
that
am
of
a
surety
ordained
to
the
shaving
of
shagpat
then
he
stood
apart
and
gazed
from
shagpat
to
the
city
that
now
began
to
move
with
the
morning
elephants
and
coursers
saddled
by
the
gates
of
the
king
palace
were
visible
and
camels
blocking
the
narrow
streets
and
the
markets
bustling
surely
though
the
sun
illumined
that
city
it
was
as
a
darkness
behind
shagpat
singled
by
the
beams
of
aklis
the
plot
now
while
shibli
bagarag
gazed
on
shagpat
kindled
by
the
beams
of
aklis
lo
the
genii
karavejis
and
veejravoosh
circling
each
other
in
swift
circles
like
two
sapphire
rings
toward
him
and
they
whirled
to
a
point
above
his
head
and
fell
and
prostrated
themselves
at
his
feet
so
he
cried
ye
slaves
of
the
sword
my
servitors
how
of
the
whereabout
of
karaz
they
answered
master
of
the
event
we
found
him
after
many
circlings
far
off
and
was
by
the
borders
of
the
putrid
sea
we
came
not
close
on
him
for
he
is
stronger
than
we
without
the
sword
but
it
seemed
he
was
distilling
drops
of
an
oil
from
certain
substances
large
thickened
drops
that
dropped
into
a
phial
then
shibli
bagarag
said
season
of
weakness
with
me
is
over
and
they
that
confide
in
my
strength
my
cunning
my
watchfulness
my
wielding
of
the
sword
have
nought
to
fear
for
themselves
now
this
is
my
plot
o
feshnavat
that
part
of
it
in
which
thou
art
to
have
a
share
is
that
thou
depart
forthwith
to
the
city
yonder
and
enter
thy
palace
by
a
back
entrance
and
i
will
see
that
thou
art
joined
within
an
hour
of
thy
arrival
there
by
baba
mustapha
my
uncle
the
gabbler
he
is
there
as
i
guess
by
signs
i
have
had
warnings
of
him
discover
him
speedily
thy
task
is
then
to
induce
him
to
make
an
attempt
on
the
head
of
shagpat
in
all
wiliness
as
he
and
thou
think
well
to
devise
he
will
fail
as
i
know
but
what
is
that
saying
of
the
poet
persist
if
thou
wouldst
truly
reach
thine
ends
for
failures
oft
are
but
advising
friends
and
he
says
every
failure
is
a
step
advanced
to
him
who
will
consider
how
it
chanced
wherefore
will
i
that
this
attempt
be
made
keeping
the
counsel
that
is
mine
thou
must
tell
baba
mustapha
i
wait
without
the
city
to
reward
him
by
my
powers
of
reward
with
all
that
he
best
loveth
so
when
he
has
failed
in
his
attempt
on
shagpat
and
blows
fall
plenteously
upon
him
and
he
is
regaled
with
the
accustomed
thwacking
as
i
have
tasted
it
in
this
undertaking
do
thou
waste
no
further
word
on
him
for
his
part
is
over
and
as
is
said
waste
not
a
word
in
enterprise
against
or
for
the
minute
flies
is
then
for
thee
o
feshnavat
to
speed
to
the
presence
of
the
king
in
his
majesty
and
thou
wilt
find
means
of
coming
to
him
by
a
disguise
once
in
the
hall
of
council
challenge
the
tongue
of
contradiction
to
affirm
shagpat
other
than
a
bewigged
this
is
for
thee
to
do
quoth
feshnavat
plaintively
after
thought
what
becometh
of
me
o
thou
master
of
the
event
shibli
bagarag
said
clutch
of
the
executioner
will
be
upon
thee
o
feshnavat
and
a
clamouring
multitude
around
short
given
thee
o
father
of
noorna
ere
the
time
of
breathing
is
commanded
to
cease
now
in
that
respite
the
thing
that
will
occur
is
for
thee
to
see
and
mark
sure
never
will
reverse
of
things
be
more
complete
and
the
other
side
of
the
picture
more
rapidly
exhibited
if
all
go
as
i
conceive
and
plot
and
the
trap
be
not
premature
nor
too
perfect
for
the
trappers
as
the
poet
has
declared
ye
that
intrigue
to
thy
slaves
proper
portions
adapt
perfectest
plots
burst
too
often
for
all
are
not
apt
and
i
witness
likewise
to
the
excellence
of
his
saying
to
master
an
event
study
men
the
minutes
are
well
spent
only
then
also
is
he
that
says
the
man
of
men
who
knoweth
men
the
man
of
men
is
he
his
army
is
the
human
race
and
every
foe
must
flee
so
have
i
apportioned
to
thee
thy
work
to
baba
mustapha
his
reserving
to
myself
the
work
that
is
mine
thereat
feshnavat
exclaimed
master
of
the
event
may
i
be
thy
sacrifice
on
my
head
be
it
and
for
thee
to
command
is
for
me
to
obey
but
surely
this
sword
of
thine
that
is
in
thy
girdle
the
marvellous
blade
is
alone
equal
to
the
project
and
the
shave
and
the
matter
might
be
consummated
the
great
thing
done
even
from
this
point
whence
we
behold
shagpat
visible
as
brought
forward
toward
us
by
the
beams
and
this
sword
swayed
by
thee
and
with
thy
skill
and
strength
and
the
hardihood
of
hand
that
is
thine
wullahy
shear
him
now
this
moment
taking
the
light
of
aklis
for
a
lather
shibli
bagarag
knotted
the
brows
of
impatience
crying
thou
forgotten
karaz
in
thy
calculations
i
know
of
a
surety
what
this
sword
will
do
and
i
wot
the
oil
he
distilleth
strengtheneth
shagpat
but
against
common
blades
yet
shall
it
not
be
spoken
of
me
shibli
bagarag
that
i
was
tripped
by
my
own
conceit
the
poet
counselleth
when
for
any
mighty
end
thou
hast
the
aid
of
heaven
mount
until
thy
strength
shall
match
those
great
means
which
are
given
nor
that
i
was
overthrown
in
despising
mine
enemy
forgetful
of
the
saying
of
the
sage
read
the
features
of
thy
foe
wherever
he
may
find
thee
small
he
is
seen
face
to
face
but
thrice
his
size
behind
thee
wullahy
this
karaz
is
a
genie
of
craft
and
resources
one
of
a
mighty
stock
and
i
must
close
with
shagpat
to
be
sure
of
him
and
that
i
am
not
deceived
by
semblances
opposing
guile
with
guile
and
guile
deeper
than
his
for
that
he
awaiteth
it
not
thinking
i
have
leaped
in
fancy
beyond
the
event
and
am
puffed
by
the
of
adulation
i
thinking
i
pluck
the
blossoms
in
my
hunger
for
the
fruit
that
i
eat
the
chick
of
the
yet
unlaid
egg
o
feshnavat
as
is
said
and
the
warrior
beareth
witness
to
the
wisdom
of
it
his
weapon
i
study
my
own
conceal
so
with
two
arms
to
his
one
shall
i
deal
the
same
also
testifieth
is
folly
of
the
hero
though
resistless
in
the
field
to
stake
the
victory
on
his
steel
and
fling
away
the
shield
and
likewise
examine
thine
armour
in
every
joint
for
slain
was
the
giant
and
by
a
pin
point
wah
is
certain
there
will
need
subtlety
in
this
undertaking
and
a
plot
plotted
so
do
thou
my
bidding
and
fail
not
in
the
part
assigned
to
thee
now
feshnavat
was
persuaded
by
his
words
and
cried
diligence
discretion
and
the
virtues
which
characterize
subordinates
i
go
and
i
delay
not
i
will
perform
the
thing
required
of
me
o
master
of
the
event
and
he
repeated
in
verse
with
danger
beset
be
the
path
crooked
or
narrow
thou
art
the
bow
and
i
the
arrow
then
embraced
he
his
daughter
kissing
her
on
the
forehead
and
the
eyes
and
tightening
the
girdle
of
his
robe
departed
with
the
name
of
allah
on
his
lips
in
the
direction
of
the
city
so
shibli
bagarag
called
to
him
the
two
genii
and
his
command
was
ye
slaves
of
the
sword
till
the
range
of
earth
and
its
mountains
and
seas
and
deserts
are
a
cluster
in
the
orb
of
the
eye
shiraz
conspicuous
as
a
rose
among
garlands
and
the
ruby
consorted
with
other
gems
in
a
setting
in
shiraz
or
the
country
adjoining
ye
will
come
upon
one
baba
mustapha
by
name
and
if
he
be
alone
ye
may
recognize
him
by
his
forlorn
look
and
the
hang
of
his
cheeks
his
vacancy
as
of
utter
abandonment
if
in
company
be
the
only
talker
that
he
seize
on
him
give
him
a
taste
of
thin
air
and
deposit
him
without
speech
on
the
roof
of
a
palace
where
ye
will
see
feshnavat
in
yonder
city
this
do
ere
the
shadows
of
the
by
the
well
in
the
plain
move
up
the
mounds
that
enclose
the
fortified
parts
cried
karavejis
and
veejravoosh
hear
is
to
obey
up
into
the
sky
like
two
bright
balls
tossed
by
jugglers
the
two
genii
shot
and
watching
them
noorna
bin
noorka
said
life
there
is
a
third
wanting
ravejoura
and
with
aid
of
the
three
earth
could
have
planted
no
obstruction
to
thy
stroke
but
thou
wert
tempted
by
the
third
temptation
in
aklis
and
left
not
the
hall
in
triumph
the
hall
of
the
duping
brides
he
answered
is
so
my
soul
and
the
penalty
is
mine
by
which
i
am
made
to
employ
deceits
ere
i
strike
and
she
said
to
the
generosity
of
gulrevaz
thou
owest
karavejis
and
veejravoosh
and
i
think
she
was
generous
seeing
thee
true
to
me
in
love
she
that
hath
sorrows
so
he
said
of
the
sorrows
of
gulrevaz
tell
me
of
them
but
she
said
o
my
betrothed
wouldst
thou
have
this
tongue
blistered
and
a
consuming
spark
shot
against
this
bosom
then
he
it
clear
to
me
she
put
her
mouth
to
his
ear
saying
is
a
curse
on
whoso
telleth
of
things
in
aklis
and
to
tattle
of
the
seven
and
their
sister
forerunneth
wretchedness
surely
he
stooped
to
that
fair
creature
and
folded
her
to
his
heart
his
whole
soul
heaving
to
her
and
he
cried
again
and
again
harm
hap
to
thee
through
me
by
allah
no
and
he
closed
the
privileged
arm
of
the
bridegroom
round
her
waist
that
had
the
yieldingness
of
the
the
flowingness
of
the
summer
and
seemed
as
melting
at
the
first
gentle
pressure
she
leaning
her
head
shyly
on
his
shoulder
yet
confiding
in
his
faithfulness
it
was
that
she
was
shy
of
the
great
bliss
in
her
bosom
and
was
made
timid
by
the
fervour
of
her
affection
as
is
sung
deeper
than
the
source
of
blushes
is
the
power
that
makes
them
start
up
in
floods
the
red
stream
rushes
at
one
whisper
of
the
heart
and
it
is
sung
in
words
present
to
the
youth
as
he
surveyed
her
o

of
the

o
beauty
of
the
bride
her
bashful
joys
like
serpents
sting
her
tenderness
to
tears
her
hopes
are
sleeping
eagles
in
the
shining
of
the
spheres
o

of

o
beauty
of
the
bride
and
she
a
lapping
antelope
that
from
her
image
flees
and
she
a
dove
caught
in
two
hands
to
pant
as
she
shall
please

beauty
of

like
torrents

hasty
soul

o
beauty
beauty
beauty
of
the
bride
they
were
thus
together
abarak
leaning
under
one
wing
of
koorookh
for
shade
up
the
slope
of
the
hill
and
shibli
bagarag
called
to
him
abarak
look
if
there
be
aught
impending
over
the
city
so
he
arose
and
looked
crying
with
plunging
legs
high
up
in
air
over
the
city
between
two
bright
bodies
shibli
bagarag
exclaimed
well
the
second
chapter
of
the
event
is
opened
so
call
it
thou
that
tellest
of
the
shaving
of
shagpat
it
will
be
the
shortest
then
he
said
shadow
of
yonder
palm
is
now
a
slanted
spear
up
the
looped
wall
of
the
city
now
the
time
of
shagpat
triumph
and
his
greatest
majesty
will
be
when
yonder
walls
chase
the
shadow
of
the
palm
up
this
hill
and
then
will
baba
mustapha
be
joining
the
chorus
of
creatures
that
shriek
toward
even
ere
they
snooze
there
not
an
ape
in
the
woods
nor
hyaena
in
the
forest
nor
birds
on
the
branches
nor
frogs
in
the
marsh
that
will
outnoise
baba
mustapha
under
the
thong
wullahy
grieve
his
soul
in
aftertime
when
he
sitteth
secure
in
honours
courted
with
a
thousand
ears
at
his
bidding
that
so
much
breath
him
without
toll
of
the
tongue
but
as
the
poet
says
truly
the
chariot
of
events
lifteth
many
dusty
heels
and
many
high
and
of
renown
it
crusheth
with
its
wheels
wah
i
have
had
my
share
of
the
thong
and
am
i
master
of
the
event
to
be
squeamish
in
attaining
an
end
by
its
means
nay
by
this
sword
thereat
he
strode
once
again
to
the
summit
of
the
hill
and
in
a
moment
the
genii
fronted
him
like
two
shot
arrows
quivering
from
the
flight
so
he
cried
is
done
they
answered
faithfulness
so
he
beckoned
to
noorna
and
she
came
forward
swiftly
to
him
exclaiming
read
the
plot
and
the
thing
required
of
me
so
say
nought
but
embrace
me
ere
i
leave
thee
my
betrothed
my
master
he
embraced
her
and
led
her
to
where
the
genii
stood
then
said
he
to
the
genii
her
to
the
city
o
ye
slaves
of
the
sword
and
watch
over
her
there
if
ye
let
but
an
evil
wind
ruffle
the
hair
of
her
head
lo
i
sever
ye
with
a
stroke
that
shaketh
the
under
worlds
remain
by
her
till
the
shrieks
of
baba
mustapha
greet
ye
and
then
will
follow
commotion
among
the
crowd
and
cries
for
shagpat
to
show
himself
to
the
people
cries
also
of
death
to
feshnavat
and
there
will
be
an
assembly
in
the
king
hall
of
justice
thither
lead
ye
my
betrothed
and
watch
over
her
and
he
said
to
noorna
knowest
my
design
so
she
said
condemnation
is
passed
on
feshnavat
that
i
appear
in
the
hall
as
bride
of
shagpat
and
so
rescue
him
that
is
my
father
and
she
cried
fair
delightful
time
that
is
coming
my
happiness
and
thy
honour
on
earth
dateth
from
it
farewell
o
my
betrothed
beloved
youth
eyes
of
mine
these
genii
will
be
by
and
there
no
cause
for
fear
or
sorrow
and
is
for
thee
to
look
like
morning
that
speeds
the
march
of
light
thou
my
betrothed
art
thou
not
all
that
enslaveth
the
heart
of
woman
cried
shibli
bagarag
thou
o
noorna
all
that
enraptureth
the
soul
of
man
allah
keep
thee
my
life
lo
while
they
were
wasting
the
rich
love
in
their
hearts
the
genii
rose
up
with
noorna
and
she
waving
her
hand
to
him
was
soon
distant
and
as
the
white
breast
of
a
bird
turned
to
the
sun
then
went
he
to
where
abarak
was
leaning
and
summoned
koorookh
and
the
twain
mounted
him
and
rose
up
high
over
the
city
of
shagpat
to
watch
the
ripening
of
the
event
as
a
vulture
watcheth
over
the
desert
the
dish
of
pomegranate
grain
now
in
the
city
of
shagpat
kadza
spouse
of
shagpat
she
that
had
belaboured
shibli
bagarag
had
a
dream
while
these
things
were
doing
and
it
was
a
dream
of
danger
and
portent
to
the
glory
of
her
eyes
shagpat
so
at
the
hour
when
he
was
revealed
to
shibli
bagarag
made
luminous
by
the
beams
of
aklis
kadza
went
to
an
inner
chamber
and
greased
her
hands
and
her
eyelids
and
drank
of
a
phial
and
commenced
tugging
at
a
brass
ring
fixed
in
the
floor
and
it
yielded
and
displayed
an
opening
over
which
she
stooped
the
upper
half
of
her
leanness
and
pitching
her
note
high
called
after
that
she
rose
and
retreated
from
the
hole
hastily
and
in
the
winking
of
an
eye
it
was
filled
as
a
pillar
of
black
smoke
by
the
body
of
the
genie
he
breathing
hard
with
mighty
travel
so
he
cried
to
her
between
his
pantings
and
puffings
where
am
i
wanted
and
for
what
now
kadza
was
affrighted
at
the
terribleness
of
his
manner
and
the
great
smell
of
the
genie
was
an
intoxication
in
her
nostril
so
that
she
reeled
and
could
just
falter
out
to
the
identical
then
he
in
a
voice
like
claps
of
thunder
with
it
she
answered
beseechingly
a
dream
i
had
o
genie
a
dream
of
danger
to
him
while
she
spake
the
genie
clenched
his
fists
and
stamped
so
that
the
palace
shook
and
the
earth
under
it
exclaiming
abominable
kadza
a
dream
is
it
another
dream
wilt
thou
cease
dreaming
awhile
thou
silly
woman
know
i
not
he
that
powerful
against
us
is
in
aklis
crowned
ape
and
that
his
spells
are
gone
and
i
was
distilling
drops
to
defy
the
sword
and
strengthen
shagpat
from
assault
yet
bringest
thou
me
from
my
labour
by
the
putrid
sea
with
thy
accursed
dream
thereat
he
frowned
and
shot
fire
at
her
from
his
eyes
so
that
she
singed
and
the
room
thickened
with
a
horrible
smell
of
burning
she
feared
greatly
and
trembled
but
he
cooled
himself
against
the
air
crying
presently
in
a
diminished
voice
hear
this
dream
thou
foolish
kadza
is
as
well
to
hear
it
probably
rabesqurat
hath
sent
thee
some
sign
from
aklis
where
she
ferryeth
a
term
what
that
saying
a
woman
at
the
core
of
every
plot
man
plotteth
and
like
an
fruit
first
at
the
core
it
rotteth
so
out
with
it
thou
kadza
now
the
urgency
of
that
she
had
dreamed
overcame
fear
in
kadza
and
she
said
great
genie
and
terrible
my
dream
was
this
lo
i
saw
an
assemblage
of
the
beasts
of
the
forests
and
them
that
inhabit
wild
places
and
there
was
the
elephant
and
the
rhinoceros
and
the
hippopotamus
and
the
camel
and
the
camelopard
and
the
serpent
and
the
striped
tiger
also
the
antelope
the
hyena
the
jackal
and
above
them
eminent
in
majesty
the
lion
surely
he
sat
as
on
a
high
seat
and
they
like
suppliants
thronging
the
presence
this
i
saw
the
heart
on
my
ribs
beating
for
shagpat
and
there
appeared
among
the
beasts
a
monkey
all
ajoint
with
tricks
jerking
with
malice
he
looking
as
hungry
for
the
doing
of
things
detestable
and
the
lion
scorned
him
and
i
marked
him
ridicule
the
lion
was
so
and
the
lion
began
to
scowl
and
the
other
beasts
marked
the
displeasure
of
the
lion
then
chased
they
that
monkey
from
the
presence
and
for
awhile
he
was
absent
and
the
lion
sat
in
his
place
gravely
with
calm
receiving
homage
of
the
other
beasts
and
down
to
his
feet
came
the
eagle
that
lord
of
air
and
before
him
kneeled
the
great
elephant
and
the
subtle
serpent
eyed
him
with
awe
but
soon
did
that
monkey
the
wretched
animal
reappear
and
there
was
no
peace
for
the
lion
he
worrying
till
close
within
stretch
of
the
lion
paw
wah
the
lion
might
have
crushed
him
but
that
magnanimous
and
so
it
was
that
as
the
monkey
advanced
the
lion
roared
to
him
begone
the
monkey
cried
who
commandeth
the
lion
roared
the
king
of
beasts
and
thy
king
that
monkey
cried
homage
to
the
king
of
beasts
and
my
king
allah
keep
him
in
his
seat
and
i
would
he
were
visible
the
lion
roared
he
sitteth
here
acknowledged
thou
graceless
animal
and
he
before
thee
apparent
the
monkey
affected
eagerness
and
gazed
about
him
and
peered
on
this
beast
and
on
that
exclaiming
like
one
that
injured
and
under
slight
what
this
i
done
and
wherein
have
i
offended
that
he
should
be
hidden
from
me
when
pointed
out
the
lion
roared
is
i
where
i
sit
thou
offensive
monkey
that
monkey
in
the
upper
pitch
of
amazement
thou
is
it
for
created
thing
to
acknowledge
a
king
without
a
tail
and
o
beasts
of
the
forest
and
the
wilderness
how
say
ye
am
i
to
blame
that
i
bow
not
to
one
that
hath
it
not
that
the
lion
rose
and
roared
in
the
extreme
of
wrath
but
the
word
he
was
about
to
utter
was
checked
in
him
for
was
manifest
that
where
he
would
have
lashed
a
tail
he
shook
a
stump
wagging
it
as
the
dog
doth
lo
when
the
lion
saw
that
the
majesty
melted
from
him
and
in
a
moment
the
plumpness
of
content
and
prosperity
forsook
him
so
that
his
tawny
skin
hung
flabbily
and
his
jaw
drooped
and
shame
deprived
him
of
stateliness
abashed
was
he
now
seeing
the
lion
shamed
in
this
manner
my
heart
beat
violently
for
shagpat
so
that
i
awoke
with
the
strength
of
its
beating
and
was
hidden
from
me
whether
the
monkey
was
punished
by
the
lion
or
exalted
by
the
other
beasts
in
his
place
or
how
came
it
that
the
lion
tail
was
lost
witched
from
him
by
that
villain
of
mischief
the
monkey
but
o
great
genie
i
knew
there
was
a
lion
among
men
reverenced
and
with
enemies
that
lion
he
that
espoused
me
and
my
glory
shagpat
was
enough
to
know
that
and
tremble
at
the
omen
of
my
dream
o
genie
wherefore
i
thought
it
well
to
summon
thee
here
that
thou
mightest
set
a
guard
over
shagpat
and
shield
him
from
the
treacheries
that
beset
him
when
kadza
had
ceased
speaking
the
genie
glowered
at
her
awhile
in
silence
then
said
he
creature
is
that
kadza
which
tormenteth
like
the
tongue
of
a
woman
is
small
as
her
pretensions
to
virtue
and
which
showeth
how
the
chapters
of
her
history
should
be
read
by
the
holy
ones
even
in
its
manner
of
movement
cried
kadza
flea
that
hoppeth
so
he
said
well
hast
thou
strength
to
carry
one
of
my
weight
o
kadza
she
answered
in
squeamishness
wullahy
i
but
a
woman
genie
though
the
wife
of
shagpat
and
to
carry
thee
is
for
the
camel
and
the
elephant
and
the
horse
then
he
thy
girdle
and
when
tightened
let
a
loose
loop
hang
from
it
she
did
that
and
he
gave
her
a
dark
powder
in
her
hand
saying
the
half
of
this
and
what
remaineth
mix
with
water
and
sprinkle
over
thee
that
did
she
and
thereupon
he
exclaimed
go
and
thy
part
is
to
move
round
shagpat
and
a
wind
will
strike
thee
from
one
quarter
and
from
which
quarter
it
striketh
is
the
one
of
menace
and
danger
to
shagpat
so
kadza
was
diligent
in
doing
what
the
genie
commanded
and
sought
for
shagpat
and
moved
round
him
many
times
but
no
wind
struck
her
she
went
back
to
the
genie
and
told
him
of
this
and
the
genie
cried
no
wind
not
one
from
aklis
then
will
shagpat
of
a
surety
triumph
and
we
with
him
now
there
was
joy
on
the
features
of
kadza
and
karaz
till
suddenly
he
said
in
thy
song
how
if
there
be
danger
and
menace
above
and
the
thing
that
may
be
then
he
seized
kadza
and
slung
her
by
him
and
went
into
the
air
and
up
it
till
the
roofs
of
the
city
of
shagpat
were
beneath
their
feet
all
on
them
visible
and
under
an
awning
on
the
roof
of
a
palace
there
was
the
vizier
feshnavat
and
baba
mustapha
they
ear
to
lip
in
consultation
and
baba
mustapha
brightening
with
the
matter
revealed
to
him
and
bobbing
his
head
and
breaking
on
the
speech
of
the
vizier
now
when
he
saw
them
the
genie
blew
from
his
nostrils
a
double
stream
of
darkness
which
curled
in
a
thick
body
round
and
round
him
and
kadza
slung
at
his
side
was
enveloped
in
it
as
with
folds
of
a
huge
serpent
then
the
genie
hung
still
and
lo
two
radiant
figures
swept
toward
the
roof
he
watched
and
between
them
noorna
bin
noorka
her
long
dark
hair
borne
far
backward
and
her
robe
of
silken
stuff
fluttering
and
straining
on
the
pearl
buttons
as
she
flew
there
was
that
in
her
beauty
and
the
silver
clearness
of
her
temples
and
her
eyes
and
her
cheeks
and
her
neck
and
chin
and
ankles
that
made
the
genie
shudder
with
love
of
her
and
he
was
nigh
dropping
kadza
to
the
ground
forgetful
of
all
save
noorna
when
he
recovered
and
it
was
by
tightening
his
muscles
till
he
was
all
over
hard
knots
noorna
was
seated
on
a
cushion
and
descending
he
heard
her
speak
his
name
then
sniffed
he
the
air
and
said
to
kadza
spouse
of
shagpat
a
plot
breweth
and
the
odour
of
it
is
in
my
nostril
fearest
thou
a
scorching
for
his
sake
thou
adorest
the
miracle
of
men
she
answered
my
head
be
it
and
my
eyes
he
said
shall
alight
thee
behind
the
pole
of
awning
on
yonder
roof
where
are
the
two
bright
figures
and
the
dingy
one
and
the
vizier
feshnavat
and
noorna
bin
noorka
a
flame
will
spring
up
severing
thee
from
them
but
secure
from
it
by
reason
of
the
powder
i
gave
thee
all
save
the
hair
that
on
thee
have
another
shape
than
that
which
is
thine
even
that
of
a
slave
of
noorna
bin
noorka
and
say
to
her
when
she
asketh
thy
business
with
her
o
my
mistress
let
the
storm
the
when
it
would
surprise
men
do
this
and
thy
part
done
o
kadza
thereupon
he
swung
a
circle
and
alighted
her
behind
the
pole
of
awning
on
the
roof
and
vanished
and
the
circle
of
flame
rose
up
and
kadza
passed
through
it
slightly
scorched
and
answered
to
the
question
of
noorna
my
mistress
let
the
storm
the
when
it
would
surprise
men
now
when
noorna
beheld
her
and
heard
her
voice
she
pierced
the
disguise
and
was
ware
of
the
wife
of
shagpat
and
glanced
her
large
eyes
over
kadza
from
head
to
sole
till
they
rested
on
the
loose
loop
in
her
girdle
seeing
that
she
rose
up
and
stretched
her
arms
and
spread
open
the
palm
of
her
hand
and
slapped
kadza
on
the
cheek
and
ear
a
hard
slap
so
that
she
heard
bells
and
ere
she
ceased
to
hear
them
another
so
that
kadza
staggered
back
and
screamed
and
feshnavat
was
moved
to
exclaim
has
the
girl
thy
favourite
offended
in
o
my
daughter
so
noorna
continued
slapping
kadza
and
cried
she
not
sluttish
and
where
the
point
of
decency
established
in
her
this
luloo
shall
her
like
appear
before
thee
and
me
with
loose
girdle
then
she
pointed
to
the
girdle
and
kadza
tightened
the
loose
loop
and
fell
upon
the
ground
to
avoid
the
slaps
and
noorna
knelt
by
her
and
clutched
at
a
portion
of
her
dress
and
examined
it
peering
intently
and
she
caught
up
another
part
and
knotted
it
as
if
to
crush
a
living
creature
hunting
over
her
and
grasping
at
her
and
so
it
was
that
while
she
tore
strips
from
the
garments
of
kadza
feshnavat
jumped
suddenly
in
wrath
and
pinched
over
his
garments
crying
is
unbearable
is
i
know
not
what
other
than
a
flea
that
persecuteth
me
upon
that
noorna
ran
to
him
and
while
they
searched
together
for
the
flea
baba
mustapha
fidgeted
and
worried
in
his
seat
lurching
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
muttering
curses
and
it
was
evident
he
too
was
persecuted
and
there
was
no
peace
on
the
roof
of
that
palace
but
pinching
and
howling
and
stretching
of
limbs
and
curses
snarled
in
the
throat
and
imprecations
on
the
head
of
the
tormenting
flea
surely
the
soul
of
kadza
rejoiced
for
she
knew
the
flea
was
karaz
whom
she
had
brought
with
her
in
the
loose
loop
of
her
girdle
through
the
circle
of
flame
which
was
a
barrier
against
him
she
glistened
at
the
triumph
of
the
flea
but
noorna
strode
to
her
and
took
her
to
the
side
of
the
roof
and
pitched
her
down
it
and
closed
the
passage
to
her
then
ran
she
to
karavejis
and
veejravoosh
whispering
in
the
ear
of
each
word
of
the
sword
and
afterward
aloud
think
ye
will
be
the
term
of
the
staying
of
my
betrothed
in
aklis
crowned
ape
they
answered
pearl
of
the
morn
crowned
ape
till
such
time
as
shagpat
be
shaved
so
she
beat
her
breast
crying
utter
stagnation
till
shagpat
be
shaved
and
oh
stoppage
in
the
tide
of
business
dense
cloud
upon
the
face
of
beauty
and
frost
on
the
river
of
events
till
shagpat
be
shaved
and
oh
my
betrothed
crowned
ape
in
aklis
till
shagpat
be
shaved
then
she
lifted
her
hands
and
arms
and
said
him
where
he
is
ye
genii
and
away
for
he
needeth
comfort
thereat
the
glittering
spirits
dissolved
and
thinned
and
were
as
taper
gleams
of
curved
light
across
the
water
in
their
ascent
of
the
heavens
when
they
were
gone
noorna
exclaimed
for
the
dish
of
pomegrante
grain
o
baba
mustapha
and
let
nothing
delay
us
further
quoth
baba
mustapha
ordered
o
my
princess
and
fair
mistress
from
the
confectioner
and
with
it
the
sleepy
drug
from
the
seller
of
medicaments
accursed
flea
now
she
laughed
and
said
am
i
o
baba
mustapha
so
he
said
thou
o
bright
shooter
of
beams
but
i
wullahy
but
a
bundle
of
points
through
the
pertinacity
of
this
flea
a
house
of
irritabilities
a
mere
mass
of
fretfulness
and
i
no
thought
but
for
the
chasing
of
this
unlucky
flea
was
never
flea
like
it
in
the
world
before
this
flea
and
is
a
flea
to
anger
the
holy
ones
and
make
the
saintly
dervish
swear
at
such
a
flea
he
wriggled
and
curled
where
he
sat
and
noorna
cried
shall
we
be
defeated
by
a
flea
we
that
would
shave
shagpat
and
release
this
city
and
the
world
from
bondage
and
she
looked
up
to
the
sky
that
was
then
without
a
cloud
blazing
with
the
sun
on
his
mid
seat
and
exclaimed
star
of
shagpat
wilt
thou
constantly
be
in
the
ascendant
and
defeat
us
the
liberators
of
men
with
a
flea
now
whenever
one
of
the
twain
baba
mustapha
and
the
vizier
feshnavat
commenced
speaking
of
the
dish
of
pomegranate
grain
the
torment
of
the
flea
took
all
tongue
from
him
and
was
destruction
to
the
gravity
of
council
and
deliberation
the
dish
of
pomegranate
grain
was
brought
to
them
by
slaves
and
the
drug
to
induce
sleep
yet
neither
could
say
aught
concerning
it
they
were
as
jointy
grasshoppers
through
the
action
of
the
flea
and
the
torment
of
the
flea
became
a
madness
they
shrieking
now
with
thee
is
now
with
me
fires
of
the
damned
on
this
flea
in
their
extremity
they
called
to
allah
for
help
but
no
help
came
save
when
they
abandoned
all
speech
concerning
the
dish
of
pomegranate
grain
then
were
they
for
a
moment
eased
of
the
flea
so
noorna
recognized
the
presence
of
her
enemy
karaz
and
his
malicious
working
and
she
went
and
fetched
a
jar
brimmed
with
water
for
the
bath
and
stirred
it
with
her
forefinger
and
drew
on
it
a
flame
from
the
rays
of
the
sun
till
there
rose
up
from
the
jar
a
white
thick
smoke
she
rustled
her
raiment
making
the
wind
of
it
collect
round
baba
mustapha
and
feshnavat
and
did
this
till
the
sweat
streamed
from
their
brows
and
bodies
and
they
were
sensible
of
peace
and
the
absence
of
the
flea
then
she
whisked
away
the
smoke
and
they
were
attended
by
slaves
with
fresh
robes
and
were
as
new
men
and
sat
together
over
the
dish
of
pomegranate
grain
praising
the
wisdom
of
noorna
and
her
power
then
baba
mustapha
revived
in
briskness
and
cried
the
dish
and
is
in
my
hands
an
instrument
an
instrument
of
vengeance
and
one
to
endow
the
skilful
wielder
of
it
with
glory
and
is
as
i
designed
it
sweet
seasoned
savoury
a
flattery
to
the
eye
and
no
deceiver
to
the
palate
wah
and
such
an
instrument
in
the
hands
of
the
discerning
and
the
dexterous
and
the
discreet
and
the
judicious
and
them
gifted
with
determination
not
such
as
sufficeth
for
the
overturning
of
empires
and
systems
o
my
mistress
fair
one
sapphire
of
this
city
and
not
written
that
i
shall
beguile
shagpat
by
its
means
and
master
the
event
and
shame
the
king
of
oolb
and
his
court
and
i
shall
then
sit
in
state
among
men
and
surround
myself
with
adornments
and
with
slaves
mute
that
speak
not
save
at
the
signal
and
are
as
statues
round
the
cushions
of
their
lord
that
myself
and
i
shall
surround
myself
with
the
flatteries
of
wealth
and
walk
bewildered
in
silks
and
stuffs
and
perfumeries
and
sweet
young
beauties
shall
i
have
about
me
antelopes
of
grace
as
i
like
them
and
select
them
eyed
lazy
fond
of
listening
and
with
bashful
looks
that
timidly
admire
the
dignity
that
in
man
while
he
was
prating
noorna
took
the
dish
in
her
lap
and
folded
her
silvery
feet
beneath
her
and
commenced
whipping
into
it
the
drug
and
she
whipped
it
dexterously
and
with
equal
division
among
the
grain
whipping
it
and
the
flea
with
it
but
she
feigned
not
to
mark
the
flea
and
whipped
harder
then
took
she
colour
and
coloured
it
saffron
and
laid
over
it
so
that
it
glittered
and
was
an
enticing
sight
and
the
dish
was
of
gold
crusted
over
with
devices
and
patterns
and
heads
of
golden
monsters
a
ravishment
of
skill
in
him
that
executed
it
cumbrous
with
ornate
golden
workmanship
likewise
there
were
places
round
the
dish
for
sticks
of
perfume
and
cups
carved
for
the
storing
of
perfumed
pellets
and
into
these
noorna
put
myrrh
and
ambergris
and
rich
incenses
aloes
sandalwood
prepared
essences
divers
keen
and
sweet
scents
then
when
all
was
in
readiness
she
put
the
dish
upon
the
knee
of
baba
mustapha
and
awoke
him
from
his
babbling
reverie
with
a
shout
and
said
instrument
verily
o
baba
mustapha
and
art
thou
a
cat
to
shave
shagpat
with
that
tongue
of
thine
now
he
arose
and
made
the
sign
of
obedience
and
said
well
o
lady
of
grace
and
bright
wit
and
now
for
the
cap
of
shiraz
and
the
persian
robe
and
my
twenty
slaves
and
seven
to
follow
me
to
the
mansion
of
shagpat
i
do
i
act
so
she
motioned
to
a
slave
to
bring
the
cap
of
shiraz
and
the
persian
robe
and
in
these
baba
mustapha
arrayed
himself
then
called
he
for
the
slaves
and
they
were
ranged
some
to
go
before
some
to
follow
him
and
he
was
exalted
and
made
the
cap
of
shiraz
nod
in
his
conceit
crying
i
not
leader
in
this
complot
wullahy
all
bow
to
me
and
acknowledge
it
then
to
check
himself
he
called
out
sternly
to
the
slaves
ye
forward
to
the
mansion
of
shagpat
and
pass
at
a
slow
pace
through
the
streets
of
the
city
solemnly
gravely
as
before
a
potentate
then
will
the
people
inquire
of
ye
is
ye
marshal
and
what
mighty
one
and
ye
will
answer
he
from
the
court
of
shiraz
nothing
less
than
a
vizier
bearing
homage
to
shagpat
even
this
dish
of
pomegranate
grain
so
they
said
hear
is
to
obey
upon
that
he
waved
his
hand
and
stalked
majestically
and
they
descended
from
the
roof
into
the
street
criers
running
in
front
to
clear
the
way
when
baba
mustapha
was
hidden
from
view
by
a
corner
of
the
street
noorna
shrank
in
her
white
shoulders
and
laughed
and
was
like
a
flashing
pearl
as
she
swayed
and
dimpled
with
laughter
and
she
cried
are
those
words
of
the
poet
and
i
testify
to
them
in
the
instance
of
baba
mustapha
with
feathers
of
the
cock
i
fashion
a
vain
creature
with
feathers
of
the
owl
i
make
a
judge
in
feature
is
not
the
barber
elate
and
lofty
he
goeth
forth
to
the
mastery
of
this
event
as
go
many
armed
with
nought
other
than
their
own
conceit
and
written
fools
from
their
fate
seek
not
to
urge
the
coxcomb
carrieth
his
scourge
so
feshnavat
smoothed
his
face
and
said
not
also
written
oft
may
the
fall
of
fools
make
wise
men
moan
too
often
hangs
the
house
on
one
loose
stone
is
so
o
noorna
my
daughter
and
i
am
as
a
reed
shaken
by
the
wind
of
apprehensiveness
and
doubt
in
me
is
a
deep
root
as
to
the
issue
of
this
undertaking
for
the
wrath
of
the
king
will
be
terrible
and
the
clamour
of
the
people
soundeth
in
my
ears
already
if
shibli
bagarag
fail
in
one
stroke
where
be
we
is
certain
i
knew
not
the
might
in
shagpat
when
i
strove
with
him
and
he
powerful
beyond
the
measure
of
man
subtlety
and
yonder
flies
a
rook
without
fellow
an
omen
and
all
ominous
and
ominous
of
ill
and
i
marked
among
the
troop
of
slaves
that
preceded
baba
mustapha
one
that
squinted
and
that
an
omen
and
o
my
daughter
i
counsel
that
thou
by
thy
magic
speed
us
to
some
remote
point
in
the
caucasus
where
we
may
abide
the
unravelling
of
this
web
securely
one
way
or
the
other
way
is
my
counsel
o
noorna
then
she
my
betrothed
and
betray
him
on
the
very
stroke
of
the
sword
and
diminish
him
by
a
withdrawal
of
that
faith
in
his
right
wrist
which
strengtheneth
it
more
than
karavejis
and
veejravoosh
wound
round
it
in
coils
and
she
leaned
her
head
and
cried
thou
there
shouting
in
the
streets
of
shiraz
and
of
shagpat
shall
we
merit
the
punishment
of
shahpesh
the
persian
on
khipil
the
builder
while
the
event
is
mastering
i
mark
this
interview
between
baba
mustapha
and
shagpat
and
do
thou
o
my
father
rest
here
on
this
roof
till
the
guard
of
horsemen
and
soldiers
of
the
law
come
hither
for
thee
and
go
with
them
sedately
fearing
nought
for
i
shall
be
by
thee
in
the
garb
of
an
old
woman
and
preserve
thy
composure
in
the
presence
of
the
king
and
shagpat
exalted
and
allow
not
the
thing
that
happeneth
let
fly
from
thee
the
shaft
of
speech
but
remain
a
slackened
bow
till
the
strength
of
my
betrothed
is
testified
fearing
nought
for
fear
is
that
which
defeateth
men
and
is
declared
in
a
distich
the
strongest
weapon
one
can
see
in
mortal
hands
is
constancy
and
for
us
to
flee
now
would
rank
us
with
that
king
described
by
the
poet
a
king
of
ind
there
was
who
fought
a
fight
from
the
first
gleam
of
morn
till
fall
of
night
but
when
the
royal
tent
his
generals
sought
proclaiming
victory
fled
was
he
who
fought
despair
possessed
them
till
they
chanced
to
spy
a
dervish
that
paced
on
with
downward
eye
they
questioned
of
the
king
he
answer
slow
fought
but
one
the
king
a
double
foe
and
o
my
father
they
interpreted
of
this
that
the
king
had
been
vanquished
he
that
was
victor
by
the
phantom
army
of
his
fears
now
the
vizier
cried
the
will
of
allah
achieved
and
consummated
and
he
was
silenced
by
her
wisdom
and
urgency
and
sat
where
he
was
diverting
not
the
arch
on
his
brow
from
its
settled
furrow
he
was
as
one
that
thirsteth
and
whose
eye
hath
marked
a
snake
of
swift
poison
by
the
water
so
thirsted
he
for
the
event
yet
hung
with
dread
from
advancing
but
noorna
bin
noorka
busied
herself
about
the
roof
drawing
circles
to
witness
the
track
of
an
enemy
and
she
clapped
her
hands
and
cried
and
lo
a
fair
that
came
to
her
and
stood
by
with
bent
head
like
a
white
lily
by
a
antelope
so
noorna
clouded
her
brow
a
moment
as
when
the
moon
darkeneth
behind
a
scud
and
cried
art
thou
in
league
with
karaz
girl
luloo
strained
her
hands
to
her
temples
exclaiming
the
terrible
genie
i
in
league
with
him
my
mistress
surely
the
charms
i
wear
and
the
amulets
i
wear
them
as
a
protection
from
that
genie
and
a
safeguard
he
that
carrieth
off
the
maidens
and
the
young
sucklings
walking
under
the
curse
of
mothers
said
noorna
luloo
have
i
boxed
those
little
ears
of
thine
this
day
the
fair
smiled
a
smile
of
submissive
tenderness
and
answered
this
day
nor
once
since
luloo
was
rescued
from
the
wicked
old
merchant
by
thy
overbidding
and
was
taken
to
the
arms
of
a
wise
kind
sister
wiser
and
kinder
than
any
she
had
been
stolen
from
she
that
is
thy
slave
for
ever
she
said
this
weeping
and
noorna
mused
as
i
divined
that
wretched
kadza
her
grief
to
come
then
spake
she
aloud
as
to
herself
i
or
could
one
know
i
should
this
day
be
a
bride
and
hearing
that
luloo
shrieked
a
bride
and
torn
from
me
and
we
two
parted
and
i
a
poor
drooping
tendril
left
to
wither
for
my
life
is
round
thee
and
worthless
away
from
thee
o
cherisher
of
the
fallen
flower
and
she
sobbed
out
wailful
verses
and
words
broken
and
without
a
meaning
but
noorna
caught
her
by
the
arm
and
swung
her
and
bade
her
fetch
on
the
instant
a
robe
of
blue
and
pile
in
her
chamber
robes
of
amber
and
saffron
and
grey
of
silks
coloured
of
the
colour
of
musk
mixed
with
pale
gold
together
with
bridal
ornaments
and
veils
of
the
bride
and
a
jewelled
circlet
for
the
brow
when
this
was
done
noorna
went
with
luloo
to
her
chamber
attended
by
and
arrayed
herself
in
the
first
dress
of
blue
and
swayed
herself
before
the
mirror
and
rattled
the
gold
pieces
in
her
hair
and
on
her
neck
with
laughter
and
luloo
was
bewildered
and
forgot
her
tears
to
watch
the
gaiety
of
her
mistress
and
lo
noorna
made
her
women
take
off
one
set
of
ornaments
with
every
dress
and
with
every
dress
she
put
on
another
set
and
after
she
had
gone
the
round
of
the
different
dresses
she
went
to
the
bathroom
with
luloo
and
at
her
bidding
luloo
entered
the
bath
beside
noorna
and
the
twain
dipped
and
shouldered
in
the
blue
water
and
were
as
when
a
single
star
is
by
the
full
moon
on
a
bright
midnight
pouring
lustre
about
and
noorna
splashed
luloo
and
said
night
we
shall
not
sleep
together
o
luloo
nor
lie
close
thy
bosom
on
mine
thereat
luloo
wept
afresh
and
cried
cruel
and
is
a
sweet
thought
for
thee
and
have
no
mind
for
me
tossing
on
my
hateful
lonely
couch
tenderly
noorna
eyed
luloo
and
the
sprinkles
of
the
bath
fell
with
the
tears
of
both
and
they
clung
together
and
were
like
the
lily
and
its
bud
on
one
stalk
in
a
shower
then
when
noorna
had
spent
her
affection
she
said
thou
of
the
long
downward
lashes
thy
love
was
constant
when
i
stood
under
a
curse
and
was
an
old
woman
a
hag
carest
thou
so
little
to
learn
the
name
of
him
that
claimeth
me
luloo
replied
thought
of
no
one
save
myself
and
my
loss
o
my
lost
pearl
happy
is
he
a
youth
of
favour
oh
how
i
shall
hate
him
that
taketh
thee
from
me
tell
me
now
his
name
o
sovereign
of
hearts
so
noorna
smoothed
the
curves
and
corners
of
her
mouth
and
calmed
her
countenance
crying
in
a
deep
tone
and
a
voice
as
of
reverence
now
at
that
name
luloo
drank
in
her
breath
and
was
awed
and
sank
in
herself
and
had
just
words
to
ask
he
demanded
thee
again
in
marriage
o
my
mistress
said
noorna
so
luloo
muttered
is
the
dispenser
of
our
fates
and
she
spake
no
further
but
sighed
and
took
napkins
and
summoned
the
and
arrayed
noorna
silently
in
the
robe
of
blue
and
bridal
ornaments
then
noorna
said
to
them
that
thronged
about
her
on
each
of
ye
a
robe
of
white
ye
that
are
maidens
and
a
fillet
of
blue
and
a
sash
of
saffron
and
abide
my
coming
and
she
said
to
luloo
thyself
in
a
robe
of
blue
even
as
mine
and
let
trinkets
lurk
in
thy
tresses
and
abide
my
coming
then
went
she
forth
from
them
and
veiled
her
head
and
swathed
her
figure
in
raiment
of
a
coarse
white
stuff
and
was
as
the
moon
going
behind
a
hill
of
dusky
snow
and
she
left
the
house
and
passed
along
the
streets
and
by
the
palaces
till
she
came
to
the
palace
of
her
father
now
filled
by
shagpat
before
the
palace
grouped
a
great
concourse
and
a
multitude
of
all
ages
and
either
sex
in
that
city
despite
the
blaze
and
the
heat
like
roaring
of
a
sea
beyond
the
mountains
was
the
noise
that
issued
from
them
and
their
eyes
were
a
fire
of
beams
against
the
portal
of
the
palace
now
she
saw
in
the
crowd
one
shafrac
a
shoemaker
and
addressed
him
saying
shafrac
the
shoemaker
what
this
assembly
and
how
got
together
for
the
poet
says
ye
string
not
such
assemblies
in
the
street
save
when
some
high
event
should
be
complete
he
answered
an
event
complete
wullahy
the
deputation
from
shiraz
to
shagpat
and
the
submission
of
that
vain
city
to
the
might
of
shagpat
and
he
asked
her
jestingly
thou
a
witch
to
guess
that
o
veiled
and
virtuous
one
quoth
she
read
the
thing
that
cometh
ere
is
come
and
i
read
danger
to
shagpat
in
this
deputation
from
shiraz
and
this
dish
of
pomegranate
grain
so
shafrac
cried
the
beard
of
my
fathers
and
that
of
shagpat
speak
of
this
to
zeel
the
he
broadened
to
one
that
was
by
him
and
said
zeel
what
thy
mind
here
a
woman
a
wise
woman
a
witch
and
she
sees
danger
to
shagpat
in
this
deputation
from
shiraz
and
this
dish
of
pomegranate
grain
now
zeel
screwed
his
visage
and
gazed
up
into
his
forehead
and
said
best
to
consult
with
bootlbac
the
the
two
then
called
to
bootlbac
the
and
told
him
the
matter
and
bootlbac
pondered
and
tapped
his
brow
and
beat
on
his
stomach
and
said
el
krazawik
the
carrier
is
good
in
such
a
case
now
from
krooz
el
krazawik
the
carrier
they
went
to
dob
the
confectioner
and
from
dob
the
confectioner
to
azawool
the
builder
and
from
azawool
the
builder
to
tcheik
the
collector
of
taxes
and
each
referred
to
some
other
till
perplexity
triumphed
and
was
a
cloud
over
them
and
the
words
to
shagpat
went
about
like
bees
and
were
canvassing
when
suddenly
a
shrill
voice
rose
from
the
midst
dominating
other
voices
and
it
was
that
of
kadza
and
she
cried
talks
here
of
danger
to
shagpat
and
what
wretch
is
it
now
tcheik
pointed
out
azawool
and
azawool
dob
and
dob
krooz
el
krazawik
and
he
bootlbac
and
the
shrugged
his
shoulder
at
zeel
and
zeel
stood
away
from
shafrac
and
shafrac
seized
noorna
and
shouted
she
this
woman
the
witch
kadza
fronted
noorna
and
called
to
her
thing
of
infamy
what
this
talk
of
thine
concerning
danger
to
our
glory
shagpat
then
noorna
replied
say
it
o
kadza
and
i
say
it
there
danger
threateneth
him
and
from
that
deputation
and
that
dish
of
pomegranate
grain
now
kadza
laughed
a
loose
laugh
and
jeered
at
noorna
crying
to
shagpat
he
that
attended
by
genii
and
watched
over
by
the
greatest
of
them
day
and
night
incessantly
and
noorna
said
ask
pardon
of
the
power
that
seeth
and
of
thee
if
i
be
wrong
wah
am
i
not
also
of
them
that
watch
over
shagpat
so
then
let
thou
and
i
go
into
the
palace
and
examine
the
doings
of
this
deputation
and
this
dish
of
pomegranate
grain
now
kadza
remembered
the
scene
on
the
roofs
of
the
vizier
feshnavat
and
relaxed
in
her
look
of
suspicion
and
said
well
let
in
to
them
thereupon
the
twain
threaded
through
the
crowd
and
locked
at
the
portals
of
the
palace
and
it
was
opened
to
them
and
they
entered
and
lo
the
hand
that
opened
the
portals
was
the
hand
of
a
slave
of
the
sword
and
against
corners
of
the
court
leaned
slaves
silly
with
slumber
so
kadza
went
up
to
them
and
beat
them
and
shook
them
and
they
yawned
and
mumbled
grain
good
grain
the
grain
of
shiraz
and
she
beat
them
with
what
might
was
hers
till
some
fell
sideways
and
some
forward
still
mumbling
pomegranate
grain
kadza
was
beside
herself
with
anger
and
vexation
at
them
tearing
them
and
cuffing
them
but
noorna
cried
kadza
what
said
i
there
danger
to
shagpat
in
this
dish
of
pomegranate
grain
and
what
that
saying
is
much
against
the
master
wish
that
slaves
too
greatly
praise
his
dish
wullahy
i
like
not
this
talk
of
the
grain
of
shiraz
now
while
noorna
spake
the
eyes
of
kadza
became
like
those
of
the
starved
and
she
sprang
off
and
along
the
marble
of
the
court
and
clawed
a
passage
through
the
air
and
past
the
marble
pillars
of
the
palace
toward
the
first
room
of
reception
noorna
following
her
and
in
the
first
room
were
slaves
leaning
and
lolling
like
them
about
the
court
and
in
the
second
room
and
in
the
third
room
silent
all
of
them
and
senseless
so
at
this
sight
the
spark
of
suspicion
became
a
mighty
flame
in
the
bosom
of
kadza
and
horror
burst
out
at
all
ends
of
her
and
she
shuddered
and
cried
for
us
and
where
our
hope
if
shagpat
be
shorn
and
he
lopped
of
the
identical
shamed
like
the
lion
of
my
dream
and
noorna
clasped
her
hands
and
said
that
i
fear
seek
for
him
o
kadza
so
kadza
ran
to
a
window
and
looked
forth
over
the
garden
of
the
palace
and
it
was
a
fair
garden
with
the
gleam
of
a
fountain
and
watered
plants
and
cool
arches
of
shade
thick
bowers
fragrant
alleys
long
sheltered
terraces
and
beyond
the
garden
a
of
marble
fanned
by
the
broad
leaves
of
a
palm
now
when
kadza
had
gazed
a
moment
she
shrieked
there
shagpat
giveth
he
not
the
light
of
a
jewel
to
the
house
that
holdeth
him
awahy
and
he
witched
there
for
an
ill
purpose
then
tore
she
from
that
room
like
a
mad
wild
thing
after
its
stolen
cubs
and
sped
along
corridors
of
the
palace
and
down
the
great
flight
of
steps
into
the
garden
and
across
the
garden
knocking
over
the
pots
in
her
haste
and
noorna
had
just
strength
to
withhold
her
from
dashing
through
the
doors
of
the
to
come
upon
shagpat
she
straining
and
crying
there
i
say
o
wise
woman
shagpat
into
him
but
noorna
clung
to
her
and
spake
in
her
ear
thou
blow
the
fire
that
menaces
him
o
kadza
and
what
are
two
women
against
the
assailants
of
such
a
mighty
one
as
he
then
said
she
rather
and
avail
thyself
of
yonder
window
by
the
pillar
so
kadza
crept
up
to
the
pillar
which
was
on
the
right
side
of
the
porch
and
the
twain
peered
through
the
window
noorna
beheld
the
dish
of
pomegranate
grain
and
it
was
on
the
floor
empty
of
the
grain
and
baba
mustapha
was
by
it
alone
making
a
lather
and
he
was
twitching
his
mouth
and
his
legs
and
flinging
about
his
arms
and
noorna
heard
him
mutter
wrathfully
accursed
flea
art
thou
at
me
again
and
she
heard
him
mutter
as
in
anguish
peace
for
thee
o
pertinacious
flea
and
my
steadiness
of
hand
will
be
gone
now
when
i
have
him
safe
as
the
hawk
his
prey
mine
enemy
this
shagpat
that
abused
me
thou
abominable
flea
and
o
thou
flea
wilt
thou
vile
thing
hinder
me
from
mastering
the
event
and
releasing
this
people
and
the
world
from
enchantment
and
bondage
and
shall
i
fail
to
become
famous
to
the
ages
and
the
times
because
of
such
as
thee
flea
so
kadza
whispered
to
noorna
that
he
muttering
of
shagpat
for
i
mark
him
not
here
nor
the
light
by
which
he
girt
she
answered
with
the
ear
and
the
eye
and
all
the
senses
now
presently
they
heard
baba
mustapha
say
in
a
louder
tone
like
one
that
is
secure
from
interruption
lathers
and
this
the
third
a
potent
lather
and
i
wot
there
not
a
hair
in
this
world
resisteth
the
sweep
of
my
blade
over
such
a
lather
as
ah
flea
of
iniquity
and
abomination
what
am
i
doomed
to
thy
torments
so
let
spread
lo
this
lather
not
the
pride
of
shiraz
and
the
polish
and
smoothness
it
sheddeth
not
roseate
my
invention
as
the
poet
says
o
accursed
flea
now
the
now
the
and
is
but
a
hop
for
thee
to
the
fires
of
the
pit
without
bottom
seize
thee
is
no
place
sacred
from
thee
and
art
thou
a
restless
soul
infernal
flea
so
then
peace
awhile
and
here
for
the
third
lather
while
he
was
speaking
baba
mustapha
advanced
to
a
large
white
object
that
sat
motionless
upright
like
a
on
a
throne
of
cushions
and
commenced
lathering
when
she
saw
that
kadza
tossed
up
her
head
and
her
throat
and
a
shriek
was
coming
from
her
for
she
was
ware
of
shagpat
but
noorna
stifled
the
shriek
and
clutched
her
fast
whispering
safe
if
thou
have
but
patience
thou
silly
kadza
and
the
flea
will
defeat
this
fellow
if
thou
spoil
it
not
so
kadza
said
looking
up
seen
of
allah
and
be
the
genii
still
in
their
depths
but
she
constrained
herself
peering
and
perking
out
her
chin
and
lifting
one
foot
and
the
other
foot
as
on
furnaces
of
fire
in
the
excess
of
the
fury
she
smothered
and
lo
baba
mustapha
worked
diligently
and
shagpat
was
behind
an
exulting
lather
even
as
one
pelted
with
wheaten
or
balls
of
powdery
perfume
and
his
hairiness
was
as
branches
of
the
forest
foliage
bent
under
a
sudden
fall
of
overwhelming
snow
that
filleth
the
pits
and
sharpeneth
the
wolves
with
hunger
and
teacheth
new
cunning
to
the
fox
a
fox
was
baba
mustapha
in
his
stratagems
and
a
wolf
in
the
fierceness
of
his
setting
upon
shagpat
surely
he
drew
forth
the
blade
that
was
to
shear
shagpat
and
made
with
it
in
the
air
a
preparatory
sweep
and
flourish
and
the
blade
frolicked
and
sent
forth
a
light
and
seemed
eager
for
shagpat
so
baba
mustapha
addressed
his
arm
to
the
shearing
and
inclined
gently
the
edge
of
the
blade
and
they
marked
him
let
it
slide
twice
to
a
level
with
the
head
of
shagpat
and
at
the
third
time
it
touched
and
kadza
howled
but
from
baba
mustapha
there
burst
a
howl
to
madden
the
beasts
and
he
flung
up
his
blade
and
wrenched
open
his
robe
crying
flea
was
it
to
bite
in
that
fashion
now
i
swear
by
the
merciful
a
fang
like
that
common
to
tigers
and
hyaenas
and
ferocious
animals
then
looked
he
for
the
mark
of
the
bite
plaining
of
its
pang
and
he
could
find
the
mark
nowhere
so
as
he
caressed
himself
eyeing
shagpat
sheepishly
and
with
gathering
awe
noorna
said
hurriedly
to
kadza
now
and
call
them
in
the
crowd
about
the
palace
that
they
may
behold
the
triumph
of
shagpat
for
is
ripe
o
kadza
and
kadza
replied
a
wise
woman
and
i
have
thee
richly
rewarded
lo
i
as
a
camel
lightened
of
fifty
loads
and
the
glory
of
shagpat
see
i
as
a
new
sun
rising
in
the
desert
wullahy
wise
and
i
do
thy
bidding
now
she
went
flying
back
to
the
palace
and
called
shrill
calls
to
the
crowd
and
collected
them
in
the
palace
and
headed
them
through
the
garden
and
it
was
when
baba
mustapha
had
summoned
courage
for
a
second
essay
and
was
in
the
act
of
standing
over
shagpat
to
operate
on
him
that
the
crowd
burst
the
doors
and
he
was
quickly
seized
by
them
and
tugged
at
and
hauled
at
and
pummelled
and
torn
and
vituperated
and
as
a
wrecked
vessel
on
stormy
waters
plunging
up
and
down
with
tattered
sails
when
the
crew
fling
overboard
freight
and
ballast
and
provision
surely
his
time
would
have
been
short
with
that
mob
but
noorna
made
kadza
see
the
use
of
examining
him
before
the
king
and
there
were
in
that
mob
sheikhs
and
fakirs
holy
men
who
listened
to
the
words
of
kadza
and
exerted
themselves
to
rescue
baba
mustapha
and
quieted
the
rage
that
was
prevailing
and
bore
baba
mustapha
with
them
to
the
great
palace
of
the
king
which
was
in
the
centre
of
that
city
now
when
the
king
heard
of
the
attempt
on
shagpat
and
the
affair
of
the
pomegranate
grain
he
gave
orders
for
the
admission
of
the
people
as
many
of
them
as
could
be
contained
in
the
hall
of
justice
and
he
set
a
guard
over
baba
mustapha
and
commanded
that
shagpat
should
be
brought
to
the
palace
even
as
he
then
was
and
with
the
lather
on
him
so
the
regal
mandate
went
forth
and
shagpat
was
brought
in
state
on
cushions
and
the
potency
of
the
drug
preserved
his
sedateness
through
all
this
and
he
remained
motionless
in
sleep
folded
in
the
centre
of
calm
and
satisfaction
while
this
tumult
was
rageing
and
the
city
shook
with
uproar
but
the
people
when
they
saw
him
whitened
behind
a
lather
wrath
at
baba
mustapha
polluting
touch
and
the
audacity
of
barbercraft
wrestled
in
them
with
the
outpouring
of
reverence
for
shagpat
and
a
clamour
arose
for
the
instant
sacrifice
of
baba
mustapha
at
the
foot
of
their
idol
shagpat
and
the
whole
of
the
city
of
shagpat
men
women
and
children
and
the
sheikhs
and
the
dervishes
and
crafts
of
the
city
besieged
the
king
palace
in
that
middle
hour
of
the
noon
clamouring
for
the
sacrifice
of
baba
mustapha
at
the
feet
of
their
idol
shagpat
the
burning
of
the
identical
now
the
great
hall
for
the
dispensing
of
justice
in
the
palace
of
the
king
was
one
on
which
the
architect
and
the
artificers
had
lavished
all
their
arts
and
subtleties
of
design
and
taste
and
their
conceptions
of
uniformity
and
grandeur
so
that
none
entered
it
without
a
sense
of
abasement
and
the
soul
acknowledged
awfulness
and
power
in
him
that
ruled
and
sat
eminent
on
the
throne
of
that
hall
for
lo
the
throne
was
of
solid
weighty
gold
overhung
with
rich
silks
and
purples
and
the
hall
was
lofty
with
massive
pillars
fifty
on
either
side
ranging
in
stateliness
down
toward
the
blaze
of
the
throne
and
the
pillars
were
pillars
of
porphyry
and
of
jasper
and
precious
marble
carven
over
all
of
them
with
sentences
of
the
cunningest
wisdom
distichs
of
excellence
odes
of
the
poet
stanzas
sharp
with
the
incisiveness
of
wit
and
that
solve
knotty
points
with
but
one
stroke
and
these
pillars
were
each
the
gift
of
a
mighty
potentate
of
earth
or
of
a
genie
in
the
centre
of
the
hall
a
fountain
set
up
a
glittering
jet
and
spread
abroad
the
breath
of
freshness
leaping
a
height
of
sixty
feet
and
shimmering
there
in
a
wide
bright
canopy
with
dropping
silver
sides
it
was
rumoured
of
the
waters
of
this
fountain
that
they
were
fed
underground
from
the
waters
of
the
sacred
river
brought
there
in
the
reign
of
el
rasoon
a
former
sovereign
in
the
city
of
shagpat
by
the
labours
of
zak
a
genie
subject
to
the
magic
of
azrooka
the
queen
of
el
rasoon
but
of
a
surety
none
of
earth
were
like
to
them
in
silveriness
and
sweet
coolingness
and
they
were
as
wine
to
the
weary
now
the
king
sat
on
his
throne
in
the
hall
and
around
him
his
ministers
and
emirs
and
chamberlains
and
officers
of
state
and
black
slaves
and
the
soldiers
of
his
guard
armed
with
naked
scimitars
and
the
king
was
as
a
sun
in
splendour
severely
grave
and
a
frown
on
his
forehead
to
darken
kingdoms
for
the
attempt
on
shagpat
had
stirred
his
kingly
wrath
and
awakened
zeal
for
the
punishment
of
all
conspirators
and
offenders
so
when
shagpat
was
borne
in
to
the
king
upon
his
throne
of
cushions
where
he
sat
upright
smiling
and
inanimate
the
king
commanded
that
he
should
be
placed
at
his
side
the
place
of
honour
and
shagpat
was
as
a
moon
behind
the
whiteness
of
the
lathers
even
as
we
behold
moon
and
sun
together
in
the
heavens
was
shagpat
by
the
king
there
was
great
hubbub
in
the
hall
at
the
entrance
of
shagpat
and
a
hum
of
rage
and
muttered
vehemence
passed
among
the
assembled
people
that
filled
the
hall
like
a
cavern
of
the
sea
the
sea
roaring
outside
but
presently
the
king
spake
and
all
hushed
then
said
he
people
thought
i
to
see
a
day
that
would
shame
shagpat
he
that
has
brought
honour
and
renown
upon
me
and
all
of
this
city
so
that
we
shine
a
constellation
and
place
of
pilgrimage
to
men
in
remote
islands
and
corners
of
the
earth
yea
and
to
afrites
and
genii
have
i
not
castigated
barbers
and
brought
barbercraft
to
degradation
so
that
no
youth
is
taught
to
exercise
it
and
through
me
the
tackle
of
the
barber
not
a
rusty
and
abominated
weapon
and
as
a
sword
thrown
by
and
broken
for
that
it
dishonoured
us
surely
too
i
have
esteemed
shagpat
precious
while
he
spake
the
king
gazed
on
shagpat
and
was
checked
by
passion
at
beholding
him
under
the
lather
so
that
the
people
praised
shagpat
and
the
king
then
said
he
people
who
shall
forecast
disasters
and
triumphs
lo
i
had
this
day
at
dawn
intelligence
from
recreant
oolb
and
its
king
and
court
and
of
their
return
to
do
honour
to
shagpat
and
i
had
this
day
at
dawn
tidings
o
people
from
shiraz
and
of
the
adhesion
of
that
vain
city
and
its
provinces
to
the
might
of
shagpat
so
commenced
the
day
yet
is
he
the
object
of
the
world
homage
within
a
few
hours
defiled
by
a
lather
and
the
hand
of
an
impious
one
at
these
words
of
the
king
there
rose
a
shout
of
vindictiveness
and
fury
but
he
cried
on
the
offenders
in
season
o
people
probably
we
have
not
abased
ourselves
for
the
honour
that
has
befallen
us
in
shagpat
and
the
distinction
among
nations
and
tribes
and
races
and
creeds
and
sects
that
we
enjoy
because
of
shagpat
behold
in
abasement
voluntarily
undertaken
there
is
exceeding
brightness
and
exaltation
for
how
is
the
sun
a
sun
save
that
daily
he
dippeth
in
darkness
to
rise
again
freshly
majestic
so
then
be
mine
the
example
o
people
of
the
city
of
shagpat
thereupon
lo
the
king
descended
from
his
throne
and
stripped
to
the
loins
flinging
away
his
glittering
crown
and
his
robes
and
abased
himself
to
the
dust
with
loud
cries
and
importunities
and
howls
and
penitential
ejaculations
and
sobbings
and
it
was
in
that
hall
as
when
the
sun
goeth
down
in
storm
likewise
the
ministers
of
the
king
and
the
viziers
and
emirs
and
officers
of
state
and
slaves
and
soldiers
of
the
guard
bared
their
limbs
and
fell
beside
the
king
with
violent
outcries
and
wailings
and
the
whole
of
the
people
in
the
hall
prostrated
their
bodies
with
wailings
and
lamentations
and
baba
mustapha
feigned
to
bewail
himself
and
noorna
bin
noorka
knelt
beside
kadza
and
shrieked
loudest
striking
her
breast
and
scattering
her
hair
and
that
hall
was
as
a
pit
full
of
serpents
writhing
and
of
tigers
and
lions
and
wild
beasts
howling
each
pitching
his
howl
a
note
above
his
neighbours
so
that
the
tone
rose
and
sank
and
there
was
no
one
soul
erect
in
that
hall
save
shagpat
he
on
his
throne
of
cushions
smiling
behind
the
lathers
inanimate
serene
as
they
that
sin
not
after
an
hour
lapse
there
came
a
pause
and
the
people
hearkened
for
the
voice
of
the
king
but
in
the
intervals
a
louder
moan
would
strike
their
ears
and
they
whispered
among
themselves
tis
that
of
the
fakir
el
zoop
and
the
moaning
and
howling
prevailed
again
and
again
they
heard
another
moan
a
deep
one
as
of
the
earth
in
its
throes
and
said
among
themselves
tis
that
of
bootlbac
the
drumbeater
and
this
led
off
to
the
howl
of
areep
the
dervish
and
this
was
followed
by
the
shriek
of
zeel
the
and
the
waul
of
krooz
el
krazawik
the
carrier
and
the
complainings
of
dob
the
confectioner
and
the
groan
of
sallap
the
broker
and
the
yell
of
azawool
the
builder
there
would
have
been
no
end
to
it
known
but
the
king
rose
and
commenced
plucking
his
beard
and
his
hair
they
likewise
in
silence
when
he
had
performed
this
ceremony
a
space
the
king
called
and
a
basin
of
water
was
brought
to
him
and
handed
round
by
slaves
and
all
dipped
in
it
their
hands
and
renewed
their
countenances
and
their
limbs
and
the
hall
brightened
with
the
eye
of
the
king
and
he
cried
people
lo
the
plot
is
revealed
to
me
and
is
a
deep
one
but
by
this
beard
we
strike
at
the
root
of
it
and
a
blow
of
deadliness
surely
we
have
humiliated
ourselves
and
vengeance
is
ours
how
say
ye
a
noise
like
the
first
sullen
growl
of
a
vexed
wild
beast
which
telleth
that
fury
is
fast
travelling
and
the
teeth
will
flash
followed
these
words
and
the
king
called
to
his
soldiers
of
the
guard
forth
with
this
wretch
that
dared
defile
shagpat
the
holy
one
and
on
your
heads
be
it
to
fetch
hither
feshnavat
the
son
of
feil
that
was
my
vizier
he
that
was
envious
of
shagpat
and
whom
we
spared
in
our
clemency
some
of
the
guard
went
from
the
hall
to
fulfil
the
king
injunction
on
feshnavat
others
thrust
forth
baba
mustapha
in
the
eyes
of
the
king
baba
mustapha
was
quaking
as
a
frog
quaketh
for
water
and
he
trembled
and
was
a
tongueless
creature
deserted
of
his
lower
limbs
and
with
eyeballs
goggling
through
exceeding
terror
now
when
the
king
saw
him
he
contracted
his
brows
as
one
that
peereth
on
a
small
and
minute
object
crying
such
as
he
this
monster
of
audaciousness
and
horrible
presumption
truly
is
said
for
ruin
and
the
deeds
preluding
change
fear
not
great
beasts
nor
eagles
when
they
range
but
dread
the
crawling
worm
or
pismire
mean
satan
selects
them
for
they
are
unseen
and
this
wretch
is
even
of
that
sort
the
select
of
satan
off
with
the
top
of
the
reptile
and
away
with
him
now
at
the
issue
of
the
mandate
baba
mustapha
choked
and
horror
blocked
the
throat
of
confession
in
him
so
that
he
did
nought
save
stagger
imploringly
but
the
prompting
of
noorna
sent
kadza
to
the
foot
of
the
throne
and
kadza
bent
her
body
and
exclaimed
king
of
the
age
is
kadza
the
espoused
of
shagpat
thy
servant
that
speaketh
and
lo
a
wise
woman
has
said
in
my
ear
how
if
this
emissary
and
instrument
of
the
evil
one
this
barber
this
filthy
fellow
be
made
to
essay
on
shagpat
before
the
people
his
science
and
his
malice
for
is
certain
that
shagpat
is
surrounded
where
he
sitteth
by
genii
invisible
defended
by
them
and
no
harm
can
hap
to
him
but
an
illumination
of
glory
and
triumph
manifest
and
for
this
barber
his
punishment
can
afterwards
be
looked
to
o
great
king
the
king
mused
awhile
and
sank
in
his
beard
then
said
he
to
them
that
had
hold
of
baba
mustapha
watching
for
the
signal
have
thought
over
it
and
the
means
of
bringing
double
honour
on
the
head
of
shagpat
so
release
this
fellow
and
put
in
his
hands
the
tackle
taken
from
him
this
was
done
and
the
people
applauded
the
wisdom
of
the
king
and
crowded
forward
with
sharpness
of
expectation
but
baba
mustapha
when
he
felt
in
his
hands
the
tackle
the
familiar
instruments
strength
and
wit
returned
to
him
in
petty
measures
and
he
thought
yet
be
time
for
my
nephew
to
strike
if
he
fail
me
not
fool
that
i
was
to
look
for
glory
and
not
leave
the
work
to
him
for
this
shagpat
is
a
mighty
one
powerful
in
fleas
and
it
needeth
something
other
than
tackle
to
combat
such
as
he
a
mighty
one
said
i
by
allah
he
awful
in
his
mightiness
so
baba
mustapha
kept
delaying
and
feigned
to
sharpen
the
blade
and
the
king
called
to
him
to
the
work
is
it
for
thee
vile
wretch
to
make
preparation
for
the
accursed
thing
in
our
presence
and
the
people
murmured
and
waxed
impatient
and
the
king
called
again
essay
this
thou
wretch
without
a
head
let
but
another
minute
pass
so
when
baba
mustapha
could
delay
no
longer
he
sighed
heavily
and
his
trembling
returned
and
the
power
of
shagpat
smote
him
with
an
invisible
hand
so
that
he
could
scarce
move
but
dread
pricked
him
against
dread
and
he
advanced
upon
shagpat
to
shear
him
and
assumed
the
briskness
of
the
barber
and
was
in
the
act
of
bending
over
him
to
bring
the
blade
into
play
when
behold
one
of
the
chamberlains
of
the
king
stood
up
in
the
presence
and
spake
a
word
that
troubled
him
and
the
king
rose
and
hurried
to
a
balcony
looking
forth
on
the
desert
and
on
three
sides
of
the
desert
three
separate
clouds
of
dust
were
visible
and
from
these
clouds
presently
emerged
horsemen
with
spears
and
pennons
and
plumes
and
he
could
discern
the
flashing
of
their
helms
and
the
glistening
of
plates
and
armour
of
gold
and
silver
seeing
this
the
colour
went
from
the
cheeks
of
the
king
and
his
face
became
as
a
pinched
pomegranate
and
he
cried
aloud
visitation
this
awahy
we
are
beset
and
abasement
brought
on
us
without
meantime
these
horsemen
detached
themselves
from
the
main
bodies
and
advanced
at
a
gallop
wheeling
and
circling
round
each
other
toward
the
walls
of
the
city
and
when
they
were
close
they
lowered
their
arms
and
made
signs
of
amity
and
proclaimed
their
mission
and
the
name
of
him
they
served
so
tidings
were
brought
to
the
king
that
the
lords
of
three
cities
with
vast
retinues
were
come
by
reason
of
a
warning
to
pay
homage
to
shagpat
the
son
of
shimpoor
and
these
three
cities
were
the
cities
of
oolb
and
of
gaf
and
of
shiraz
even
these
now
when
the
king
heard
of
it
he
rejoiced
with
an
exceeding
joy
and
arrayed
himself
in
glory
and
mounted
a
charger
the
pride
of
his
stables
and
rode
out
to
meet
the
lords
of
the
three
cities
surrounded
by
the
horsemen
of
his
guard
and
it
was
within
of
the
city
walls
that
the
four
sovereigns
met
and
dismounted
and
saluted
and
embraced
and
bestowed
on
one
another
kingly
flatteries
and
the
titles
of
cousin
and
brother
so
when
the
unctions
of
royalty
were
over
these
three
kings
rode
back
to
the
city
with
the
king
that
was
their
host
and
the
horsemen
of
the
three
kingdoms
pitched
their
tents
and
camped
outside
the
walls
making
cheer
then
the
king
of
the
city
of
shagpat
related
to
the
three
kings
the
story
of
shagpat
and
the
attempt
that
had
been
made
on
him
and
in
the
great
hall
of
justice
he
ordained
the
erecting
of
thrones
for
them
whereon
to
sit
and
they
when
they
had
paid
homage
to
shagpat
sat
by
him
there
on
either
side
then
the
king
cried
likewise
owe
we
to
shagpat
our
glory
see
now
how
the
might
that
in
him
shall
defeat
the
machinations
of
evil
o
my
cousins
of
oolb
and
of
gaf
and
of
shiraz
thereupon
he
called
forth
the
barber
so
baba
mustapha
was
thrust
forth
by
the
soldiers
of
the
guard
and
the
king
of
shiraz
who
was
no
other
than
the
great
king
shahpushan
exclaimed
when
he
beheld
baba
mustapha
why
it
is
the
prince
of
barbers
and
talkative
ones
hath
he
not
operated
on
my
head
the
head
of
me
in
old
time
truly
now
if
it
be
in
man
to
shave
shagpat
the
hand
of
this
barber
will
do
it
and
the
king
of
oolb
peered
on
baba
mustapha
crying
this
fellow
i
bastinadoed
and
the
king
of
gaf
that
was
kresnuk
famous
in
the
annals
of
the
time
said
aloud
amazed
at
the
pertinacity
of
this
barber
to
my
court
he
came
searching
some
silly
nephew
and
would
have
shaved
us
all
in
spite
of
our
noses
yea
talked
my
chief
vizier
into
a
dead
sleep
and
so
thinned
him
and
there
was
no
safety
from
him
save
in
thongs
and
stripes
and
lashes
now
upon
that
the
king
of
the
city
cried
the
will
of
allah
achieved
and
the
inviolacy
of
shagpat
made
manifest
thou
barber
thou
do
thy
worst
to
contaminate
him
and
take
the
punishment
in
store
for
thee
and
if
it
is
written
thou
succeed
then
keep
thy
filthy
life
small
chance
of
that
baba
mustapha
remembered
the
poet
words
the
abyss
is
worth
a
leap
however
wide
when
life
sweet
life
is
on
the
other
side
and
he
controlled
himself
to
the
mastery
of
his
members
and
stepped
forward
to
essay
once
more
the
shaving
of
shagpat
lo
the
great
hall
was
breathless
nought
heard
save
the
splashing
of
the
fountain
in
its
fall
and
the
rustle
of
the
robe
of
baba
mustapha
as
he
aired
his
right
arm
hovering
round
shagpat
like
a
bird
about
the
nest
and
he
was
buzzing
as
a
bee
ere
it
entereth
the
flower
and
quivered
like
a
butterfly
when
is
fluttering
over
a
blossom
and
baba
mustapha
sniffed
at
shagpat
within
arm
reach
fearing
him
so
that
the
people
began
to
hum
with
a
great
rapture
and
the
king
shahpushan
cried
mark
him
this
monkey
knoweth
the
fire
but
the
king
of
the
city
of
shagpat
was
wroth
and
commanded
his
guards
to
flourish
their
scimitars
and
the
keen
light
cut
the
chords
of
indecision
in
baba
mustapha
and
drove
him
upon
shagpat
with
a
dash
of
desperation
and
lo
he
stretched
his
hand
and
brought
down
the
blade
upon
the
head
of
shagpat
then
was
the
might
of
shagpat
made
manifest
for
suddenly
in
his
head
the
identical
rose
up
straight
even
to
a
level
with
the
roof
of
that
hall
burning
as
it
had
been
an
angry
flame
of
many
fiery
colours
and
baba
mustapha
was
hurled
from
him
a
great
space
like
a
ball
that
reboundeth
and
he
was
twisting
after
the
fashion
of
envenomed
serpents
sprawling
and
spurning
and
uttering
cries
of
horror
surely
to
see
that
sight
the
four
kings
and
the
people
bit
their
forefingers
and
winked
till
the
water
stood
in
their
eyes
and
kadza
turning
about
exclaimed
owe
we
to
the
wise
woman
where
lurketh
she
so
she
called
about
the
hall
woman
wise
woman
now
when
she
could
find
noorna
bin
noorka
nowhere
in
that
crowd
she
shrieked
exultingly
a
genie
wullahy
all
afrites
male
and
female
are
in
the
service
of
shagpat
my
light
my
eyes
my
sun
i
his
moon
meantime
the
king
of
the
city
called
to
baba
mustapha
thou
had
enough
of
barbering
o
vile
one
ho
a
second
essay
on
the
head
of
shagpat
so
shall
the
might
that
in
him
be
indisputable
bruited
abroad
and
a
great
load
upon
the
four
winds
now
baba
mustapha
was
persuaded
by
the
scimitars
of
the
guard
to
a
second
essay
on
the
head
of
shagpat
and
the
second
time
he
was
shot
away
from
shagpat
through
the
crowd
and
great
assemblage
to
the
extreme
end
of
the
hall
where
he
lay
writhing
about
abandoned
in
loathliness
and
he
in
his
despondency
and
despite
of
protestation
and
the
slackness
of
his
limbs
was
pricked
again
by
the
scimitars
of
the
guard
to
a
third
essay
on
the
head
of
shagpat
the
people
jeering
at
him
for
they
were
joyous
light
of
heart
and
lo
the
third
time
he
was
shot
off
violently
and
whirled
away
like
a
stone
from
a
sling
even
into
the
outer
air
and
beyond
the
city
walls
into
the
distance
of
waste
places
and
now
a
great
cry
rose
from
the
people
as
it
were
a
song
of
triumph
for
the
identical
stood
up
wrathfully
from
the
head
of
shagpat
burning
in
brilliance
blinding
to
look
on
he
sitting
inanimate
beneath
it
and
it
waxed
in
size
and
pierced
through
the
roof
of
the
hall
and
was
a
sight
to
the
streets
of
the
city
and
the
horsemen
camped
without
the
walls
beheld
it
and
marvelled
and
it
was
as
a
pillar
of
fire
to
the
solitudes
of
the
desert
afar
and
the
wild
arab
and
wandering
bedouins
and
caravans
of
pilgrimage
distant
cities
asked
the
reason
of
that
appearance
and
the
cunning
fakir
interpreted
it
and
the
fervent
dervish
expounded
from
it
and
messengers
flew
from
gate
to
gate
and
from
land
to
land
in
exultation
and
barbers
hid
their
heads
and
were
friendly
with
the
fox
in
his
earth
because
of
that
light
so
the
identical
burned
on
the
head
of
shagpat
as
in
wrath
and
with
exceeding
splendour
of
attraction
three
nights
and
three
days
and
the
fishes
of
the
sea
shoaled
to
the
surface
and
stared
at
it
and
the
fowls
of
the
air
congregated
about
the
fury
of
the
light
with
screams
and
mad
flutters
till
the
streets
and
mosques
and
minarets
and
bright
domes
and
roofs
and
cupolas
of
the
city
of
shagpat
were
blackened
with
scorched
feathers
of
the
vulture
and
the
eagle
and
the
rook
and
the
raven
and
the
hawk
and
other
birds
sacred
and
obscene
so
was
the
triumph
of
shagpat
made
manifest
to
men
and
the
end
of
the
world
by
the
burning
of
the
identical
three
days
and
three
nights
the
flashes
of
the
blade
now
it
was
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
and
lo
at
the
first
leap
of
the
sun
of
that
day
the
flame
of
the
identical
abated
in
its
fierceness
and
it
dwindled
and
darkened
and
tapered
and
flickered
feebly
descending
from
its
altitude
in
the
heavens
and
through
the
ceiling
of
the
hall
and
lay
down
to
sleep
among
the
intricate
lengths
and
frizzled
convolutions
and
undulating
weights
flowing
from
shagpat
an
undistinguished
hair
even
as
the
common
hairs
of
his
head
so
upon
that
the
four
fasting
kings
breathed
and
from
the
people
of
the
city
there
went
up
a
mighty
shout
of
gladness
and
congratulation
at
the
glory
they
had
witnessed
and
they
took
the
air
deeply
into
their
chests
and
were
as
divers
that
have
been
long
under
water
and
ascend
and
puff
hard
and
press
the
water
from
their
eyes
that
yet
refuse
to
acknowledge
with
a
recognition
the
things
that
be
and
the
sights
above
so
mazed
are
they
with
those
unmentionable
marvels
and
treasures
and
profusion
of
jewels
and
splendid
lazy
growths
and
lavish
filmy
illuminations
and
multitudinous
pearls
and
sheering
shells
that
lie
heaped
in
the
beds
of
the
ocean
as
the
poet
has
said
after
too
strong
a
beam
too
bright
a
glory
we
ask
is
this
a
dream
or
magic
story
and
he
says
when
i
had
rapturous
visions
such
as
make
the
sun
turn
pale
and
suddenly
awake
long
must
i
pull
at
memory
in
this
beard
ere
i
remember
men
and
things
revered
so
was
it
with
the
people
of
the
city
and
they
stood
in
the
hall
and
winked
staringly
at
one
another
shouting
and
dancing
at
intervals
capering
with
mad
gravity
exclaiming
on
the
greatness
of
that
they
had
witnessed
and
zeel
the
fell
upon
mob
the
confectioner
and
cried
this
so
o
dob
wullahy
this
glory
was
it
verily
and
dob
peered
dimly
upon
zeel
whispering
solemnly
now
art
thou
of
a
surety
that
zeel
the
known
to
me
my
and
the
twain
turned
to
sallap
the
broker
and
exchanged
interjections
with
him
and
with
azawool
the
builder
and
with
krooz
el
krazawik
the
carrier
and
they
accosted
bootlbac
the
where
he
stood
apart
drumming
the
air
as
to
a
march
of
triumph
and
no
word
would
he
utter
neither
to
zeel
nor
to
sallap
nor
to
krooz
el
krazawik
nor
to
azawool
his
neighbour
nor
to
any
present
but
continued
drumming
on
the
air
rapidly
as
in
answer
increasing
in
the
swiftness
of
his
drumming
till
it
was
a
rage
to
mark
him
and
the
excitement
about
bootlbac
became
as
a
mad
eddy
in
the
midst
of
a
mighty
stream
he
drumming
the
air
with
exceeding
swiftness
to
various
measures
beating
before
him
as
on
the
tightened
skin
lost
to
all
presences
save
the
identical
and
shagpat
so
they
edged
away
from
bootlbac
in
awe
saying
inspired
bootlbac
is
the
triumph
of
shagpat
he
drummeth
they
feigned
to
listen
to
him
till
their
ears
deceived
them
and
they
rejoiced
in
the
velocity
of
the
soundless
tune
of
bootlbac
the
and
were
stirred
by
it
excited
to
a
forgetfulness
of
their
fasting
such
was
the
force
of
the
inspiration
of
bootlbac
the
caused
by
the
burning
of
the
identical
now
the
four
kings
when
they
had
mastered
their
wits
gazed
in
silence
on
shagpat
and
sighed
and
shook
their
heads
and
were
as
they
that
have
swallowed
a
potent
draught
and
ponder
sagely
over
the
gulp
surely
the
visages
of
the
kings
of
shiraz
and
of
gaf
and
of
oolb
betokened
dread
of
shagpat
and
amazement
at
him
but
the
king
of
the
city
exulted
and
the
shining
of
content
was
on
his
countenance
and
he
cried
and
again
wondrous
and
glory
and
he
laughed
and
clucked
and
chuckled
and
the
triumph
of
shagpat
was
to
him
as
a
new
jewel
in
his
crown
outshining
all
others
and
he
was
for
awhile
as
the
cock
smitten
with
the
pride
of
his
comb
the
peacock
magnified
by
admiration
of
his
tail
then
he
cried
this
praise
we
allah
and
the
prophet
wullahy
was
wondrous
and
he
went
off
again
into
a
roll
of
cluckings
and
chucklings
and
exclamations
of
delight
crying
they
further
proof
of
the
power
in
shagpat
now
has
he
not
manifested
it
so
true
is
that
saying
the
friend
that
flattereth
weakeneth
at
length
it
is
the
foe
that
calleth
forth
our
strength
wondrous
and
never
knew
earth
a
thing
to
equal
it
in
the
range
of
marvels
now
ere
the
last
word
was
spoken
by
the
king
there
passed
through
the
sky
a
mighty
flash
those
in
the
hall
saw
it
and
the
horsemen
of
the
three
cities
encamped
without
the
walls
were
nigh
blinded
by
the
keenness
of
its
blaze
so
they
looked
into
the
height
and
saw
straight
over
the
city
a
speck
of
cloud
but
no
thunder
came
from
it
and
the
king
cried
be
genii
the
issue
of
this
miracle
is
yet
to
come
look
for
it
and
exult
then
he
turned
to
the
other
kings
but
they
were
leaning
to
right
and
left
in
their
seats
as
do
the
intoxicated
without
strength
to
answer
his
questioning
so
he
exclaimed
curse
on
my
head
have
i
forgotten
the
laws
of
hospitality
my
cousins
are
famished
he
was
giving
orders
for
the
spreading
of
a
sumptuous
banquet
when
there
passed
through
the
sky
another
mighty
flash
they
awaited
the
thunder
this
time
confidently
yet
none
came
suddenly
the
king
exclaimed
the
wrath
of
shagpat
that
his
assailants
remain
uncastigated
then
cried
he
to
the
eunuchs
of
the
guard
with
feshnavat
the
son
of
feil
and
the
king
said
to
feshnavat
plotter
envious
of
shagpat
here
the
king
kresnuk
fell
forward
at
the
feet
of
shagpat
from
sheer
inanition
and
the
king
of
the
city
ordered
instantly
wines
and
viands
to
be
brought
into
the
hall
and
commenced
saying
to
feshnavat
in
the
words
of
the
wise
entablature
of
reckless
mercy
thus
the
sage
declared
more
culpable
the
sparer
than
the
spared
for
he
that
breaks
one
law
breaks
one
alone
but
who
thwarts
justice
flouts
law
sovereign
throne
and
have
i
not
been
in
thy
case
as
the
king
was
haranguing
feshnavat
his
nostril
took
in
the
steam
of
the
viands
and
the
fresh
odours
of
the
wines
and
he
could
delay
no
longer
to
satisfy
his
craving
but
caught
up
the
goblet
and
drank
from
it
till
his
visage
streamed
the
tears
of
contentment
lo
while
he
put
forth
his
hand
tremblingly
as
to
continue
the
words
of
his
condemnation
of
the
vizier
the
heavens
were
severed
by
a
third
flash
one
exceeding
in
fierceness
the
other
flashes
and
now
the
great
hall
rocked
and
the
pillars
and
thrones
trembled
and
the
eyes
of
shagpat
opened
he
made
no
motion
but
sat
like
a
wonder
of
stone
looking
before
him
surely
kadza
shrieked
and
rushed
forward
to
him
from
the
crowd
yet
he
said
nothing
and
was
as
one
frozen
so
the
king
cried
waketh
the
flashes
preceded
his
wakening
now
shall
he
see
the
vengeance
of
kings
on
his
enemies
thereupon
he
made
a
signal
and
the
scimitars
of
the
guard
were
in
air
over
the
head
of
feshnavat
when
darkness
as
of
the
dropping
of
night
fell
upon
all
and
the
darkness
spake
saying
am
abarak
of
the
bar
preceder
of
the
event
then
it
was
light
but
the
ears
of
every
soul
present
were
pierced
with
the
wailing
of
wild
animals
and
on
all
sides
from
the
desert
hundreds
of
them
were
seen
making
toward
the
city
some
swiftly
others
at
a
heavy
pace
and
when
they
were
come
near
they
crouched
and
fawned
and
dropped
their
dry
tongues
as
in
awe
there
was
the
serpent
meek
as
before
the
days
of
sin
and
the
leopard
slinking
to
get
among
the
legs
of
men
and
the
lion
came
trundling
along
in
utter
flabbiness
raising
not
his
head
soon
the
streets
were
thronged
with
elephants
and
lions
and
sullen
tigers
and
wild
cats
and
wolves
not
a
tail
erect
among
them
great
was
the
marvel
so
the
king
cried
in
the
thick
of
wonders
banquet
we
lightly
while
they
increase
upon
us
what
yonder
little
man
this
was
abarak
that
stood
before
the
king
and
exclaimed
am
the
darkness
that
announceth
the
mastery
of
the
event
as
a
shadow
before
the
approach
and
it
is
the
shaving
of
shagpat
the
world
darkened
before
the
eyes
of
the
king
when
he
heard
this
and
in
a
moment
abarak
was
clutched
by
the
soldiers
of
the
guard
and
dragged
beside
feshnavat
to
await
the
final
blow
and
this
would
have
parted
two
heads
from
two
bodies
at
one
stroke
but
now
noorna
bin
noorka
entered
the
hall
veiled
and
in
the
bright
garb
of
a
bride
with
veiled
attendants
about
her
and
the
people
opened
to
give
her
passage
to
the
throne
of
the
king
so
she
said
the
stroke
yet
awhile
o
head
of
the
magnanimous
i
am
she
claimed
by
shagpat
surely
i
am
bride
of
him
that
is
master
of
the
event
and
the
hour
of
bridals
is
the
hour
of
clemency
the
king
looked
at
shagpat
perplexed
but
the
eye
of
shagpat
gazed
as
into
the
distance
of
another
world
then
said
he
shall
hear
nought
from
the
mouth
of
shagpat
till
he
is
avenged
and
till
then
he
is
silent
with
exceeding
wrath
hearing
this
noorna
ran
quickly
to
a
window
of
the
hall
and
let
loose
a
white
dove
from
her
bosom
then
came
there
that
flash
which
is
recorded
in
old
traditions
as
the
fourth
of
the
flashes
of
thunderless
lightnings
after
the
passing
of
which
hundreds
of
fakirs
that
had
been
awaiting
it
saw
nothing
further
on
this
earth
down
through
the
hall
it
swept
and
lo
when
the
kings
and
the
people
recovered
their
sight
to
regard
shagpat
he
was
one
side
of
him
clean
shorn
the
shaven
side
shining
as
the
very
moon
surely
from
that
moment
there
was
no
longer
aught
mortal
in
the
combat
that
ensued
for
now
while
amazement
and
horror
palsied
all
present
the
genie
karaz
uttering
a
howl
of
fury
shot
down
the
length
of
the
hall
like
a
black
and
caught
up
shagpat
and
whirled
off
with
him
into
the
air
and
they
beheld
him
dive
and
dodge
the
lightnings
that
beset
him
from
upper
heaven
catching
shagpat
from
them
now
by
the
heels
now
by
the
hair
remaining
one
side
his
head
this
lasted
a
full
hour
when
the
genie
paused
a
second
and
made
a
sheer
descent
into
the
earth
then
saw
they
the
wings
of
koorookh
each
a
league
in
length
overshadow
the
entire
land
and
on
the
neck
of
the
bird
sat
shibli
bagarag
cleaving
through
the
earth
with
his
blade
and
he
sat
on
koorookh
as
the
moon
sits
on
the
midnight
there
was
no
light
save
the
light
shed
abroad
by
the
flashes
of
the
blade
and
in
these
they
beheld
the
air
suffocated
with
afrites
and
genii
in
a
red
and
brown
and
white
heat
followers
of
karaz
strokes
of
the
blade
clove
them
and
their
blood
was
fire
that
flowed
over
the
feathers
of
koorookh
lighting
him
in
a
conflagration
but
the
bird
flew
constantly
to
a
fountain
of
earth
below
and
extinguished
it
then
the
battle
recommenced
and
the
solid
earth
yawned
at
the
gashes
made
by
the
mighty
blade
and
its
depths
revealed
how
karaz
was
flying
with
shagpat
from
circle
to
circle
of
the
regions
hurrying
with
him
downward
to
the
lowest
circle
that
was
flaming
to
points
like
the
hair
of
vast
heads
presently
they
saw
a
wondrous
quivering
flash
divide
the
genie
and
his
heels
and
head
fell
together
in
the
abysses
leaving
shagpat
prone
on
great
brasiers
of
penal
flame
then
the
blade
made
another
hissing
sweep
over
shagpat
leaving
little
of
the
wondrous
growths
on
him
save
a
topknot
but
now
was
the
hour
struck
when
rabesqurat
could
be
held
no
longer
serving
the
ferry
in
aklis
and
the
terrible
queen
streamed
in
the
sky
like
a
red
disastrous
comet
and
dived
into
the
depths
ascending
with
shagpat
in
her
arms
cherishing
him
and
lo
there
were
suddenly
a
thousand
shagpats
multiplied
about
and
the
hand
of
shibli
bagarag
became
exhausted
with
hewing
at
them
the
scornful
laugh
of
the
queen
was
heard
throughout
earth
as
she
triumphed
over
shibli
bagarag
with
hundreds
of
shagpats
illusions
and
he
knew
not
where
to
strike
at
the
shagpat
and
was
losing
all
sleight
of
hand
dexterity
and
cunning
noorna
shrieked
thinking
him
lost
but
abarak
seized
his
bar
and
leaning
it
in
the
direction
of
aklis
blew
a
pellet
from
it
that
struck
on
the
eye
of
aklis
and
this
sent
out
a
stretching
finger
of
beams
and
singled
forth
very
shagpat
from
the
myriads
of
semblances
so
that
he
glowed
and
was
ruddy
the
rest
cowering
pale
and
dissolving
like
grains
in
water
then
saw
earth
and
its
inhabitants
how
the
genie
karaz
in
the
shape
of
a
vulture
with
a
fire
beak
pecking
at
the
eyes
of
him
that
wielded
the
sword
so
that
he
was
bewildered
and
shook
this
way
and
that
over
the
neck
of
koorookh
striking
wildly
languidly
cleaving
towers
and
palaces
and
monuments
of
earth
underneath
him
now
shibli
bagarag
discerned
his
danger
and
considered
power
of
the
sword
is
to
sever
brains
and
thoughts
great
is
allah
i
seek
my
advantage
in
that
so
he
whirled
koorookh
thrice
in
the
crimson
smoke
of
the
atmosphere
and
put
the
blade
between
the
first
and
second
thought
in
the
head
of
rabesqurat
whereby
the
sense
of
the
combat
became
immediately
confused
in
her
mind
and
she
used
her
powers
as
the
fool
does
equally
against
all
for
the
sake
of
mischief
solely
no
longer
mistress
of
her
own
illusions
and
she
began
doubling
and
trebling
shibli
bagarag
on
the
neck
of
monstrous
birds
speeding
in
draggled
flightiness
from
one
point
of
the
sky
to
another
even
in
the
terror
of
the
combat
shibli
bagarag
was
fair
to
burst
into
a
fit
of
violent
laughter
at
the
sight
of
the
queen
wagging
her
neck
loosely
perking
it
like
a
mad
raven
and
he
took
heart
and
swept
the
blade
rapidly
over
shagpat
as
she
dandled
him
leaving
shagpat
but
one
hair
remaining
on
him
yet
was
that
the
identical
and
it
arose
and
was
a
serpent
in
his
head
and
from
its
jaws
issued
a
river
of
fiery
serpents
these
and
a
host
of
afrites
besieged
shibli
bagarag
and
now
to
defend
himself
he
unloosed
the
twin
genii
karavejis
and
veejravoosh
from
the
wrist
of
that
hand
which
wielded
the
sword
of
aklis
and
these
alternately
interwound
before
and
about
him
and
were
even
as
a
glittering
armour
of
emerald
plates
warding
from
him
the
assaults
of
the
host
and
lo
he
flew
and
the
battle
followed
him
over
blazing
cities
and
lands
on
fire
with
the
slanting
hail
of
sparkles
by
this
time
every
soul
in
the
city
of
shagpat
kings
and
people
all
save
abarak
and
noorna
bin
noorka
were
overcome
and
prostrate
with
their
faces
to
the
ground
but
noorna
watched
the
conflict
eagerly
and
saw
the
head
of
shagpat
sprouting
incessant
fresh
crops
of
hair
despite
the
pertinacious
shearing
of
her
betrothed
then
she
smote
her
hands
and
cried
though
i
lose
my
beauty
and
the
love
of
my
betrothed
i
must
join
in
this
or
he
be
lost
so
saying
to
abarak
over
me
she
went
into
the
air
and
as
she
passed
rabesqurat
was
multiplied
into
twenty
damsels
of
loveliness
then
abarak
beheld
a
scorpion
following
the
twenty
in
and
darting
stings
among
them
noorna
tossed
a
ring
and
it
fell
in
a
circle
of
flame
round
the
scorpion
so
while
the
scorpion
was
shooting
in
squares
to
escape
from
the
circle
the
beaked
vulture
flew
to
it
and
fluttered
a
dense
rain
which
swallowed
the
flame
and
the
scorpion
and
vulture
assailed
noorna
that
was
changed
to
a
golden
hawk
in
the
midst
of
nineteen
other
golden
hawks
now
as
rabesqurat
came
scudding
by
and
saw
the
encounter
she
made
the
twenty
hawks
a
hundred
the
genie
karaz
howled
at
her
and
pinioned
her
to
a
pillar
below
in
the
desert
with
shagpat
in
her
arms
but
as
he
soared
aloft
to
renew
the
fight
with
noorna
shibli
bagarag
loosed
to
her
aid
the
slaves
of
the
sword
and
abarak
marked
him
slope
to
a
distant
corner
of
earth
and
reascend
in
a
cloud
which
drew
swiftly
over
the
land
toward
the
great
hall
lo
shibli
bagarag
stepped
from
it
through
a
casement
of
the
hall
and
with
him
shagpat
a
slack
weight
mated
out
of
all
power
of
motion
koorookh
swooped
low
on
his
back
baba
mustapha
and
shibli
bagarag
flung
abarak
beside
him
on
the
bird
then
koorookh
whirred
off
with
them
and
while
the
heavens
raged
shibli
bagarag
prepared
a
rapid
lather
and
dashed
it
over
shagpat
and
commenced
shearing
him
with
lightning
sweeps
of
the
blade
was
as
a
racing
wheel
of
fire
to
see
him
suddenly
he
desisted
and
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
face
then
calling
on
the
name
of
allah
he
gave
a
last
keen
cunning
sweep
with
the
blade
and
following
that
the
earth
awfully
quaked
and
groaned
as
if
speaking
in
the
abysmal
tongue
the
mastery
of
the
event
to
all
men
aklis
was
revealed
in
burning
beams
as
of
a
sun
and
the
trouble
of
the
air
ceased
vapours
slowly
curling
to
the
four
quarters
shibli
bagarag
had
smitten
clean
through
the
identical
terribly
had
noorna
and
those
that
aided
her
been
oppressed
by
the
multitude
of
their
enemies
but
in
a
moment
these
melted
away
and
karaz
together
with
the
scorpion
that
was
goorelka
vanished
day
was
on
the
baldness
of
shagpat
conclusion
so
was
shaved
shagpat
the
son
of
shimpoor
the
son
of
shoolpi
the
son
of
shullum
by
shibli
bagarag
of
shiraz
according
to
preordainment
the
chronicles
relate
that
no
sooner
had
he
mastered
the
event
than
men
on
the
instant
perceived
what
illusion
had
beguiled
them
and
in
the
words
of
the
poet
the
blush
with
which
their
folly
they
confess
is
the
first
prize
of
his
supreme
success
even
bootlbac
the
drummed
in
homage
to
him
and
the
four
kings
were
they
that
were
loudest
in
their
revilings
of
the
spouse
of
kadza
and
most
obsequious
in
praises
of
the
master
the
king
of
the
city
was
fain
to
propitiate
his
people
by
a
voluntary
resignation
of
his
throne
to
shibli
bagarag
and
that
king
took
well
to
heart
the
wisdom
of
the
sage
when
he
says
power
on
illusion
based
all
the
more
disastrous
is
its
certain
fall
surely
shibli
bagarag
returned
the
sword
to
the
sons
of
aklis
flashing
it
in
midnight
air
and
they
with
the
others
did
reverence
to
his
achievement
they
were
now
released
from
the
toil
of
sharpening
the
sword
a
of
years
to
wander
in
delight
on
the
fair
surface
of
the
flowery
earth
breathing
its
roses
wooing
its
brides
for
the
mastery
of
an
event
lasteth
among
men
the
space
of
one
cycle
of
years
and
after
that
a
fresh
illusion
springeth
to
befool
mankind
and
the
seven
must
expend
the
concluding
in
preparing
the
edge
of
the
sword
for
a
new
mastery
as
the
poet
declareth
in
his
scorn
some
doubt
eternity
from
life
begun
has
folly
ceased
within
them
sire
to
son
so
ever
fresh
illusions
will
arise
and
lord
creation
until
men
are
wise
and
he
adds
that
is
a
distant
period
so
prepare
to
fight
the
false
o
youths
and
never
spare
for
who
would
live
in
chronicles
renowned
must
combat
folly
or
as
fool
be
crowned
now
for
the
kings
of
shiraz
and
of
gaf
shibli
bagarag
entertained
them
in
honour
but
the
king
of
oolb
he
disgraced
and
stripped
of
his
robes
to
invest
baba
mustapha
in
those
royal
emblems
a
punishment
to
the
treachery
of
the
king
of
oolb
as
is
said
by
aboo
eznol
when
nations
with
opposing
forces
rash
shatter
each
other
thou
that
wouldst
have
stood
apart
to
profit
by
the
monstrous
feud
thou
art
the

victim
of

take
colours
of
whichever
side
thou
wilt
and
stedfastly
thyself
in
battle
range
yet
having
taken
shouldst
thou
dare
to
change
suspicion
hunts
thee
as
a
thing
of
guilt
baba
mustapha
was
pronounced
sovereign
of
oolb
amid
the
acclamations
of
the
guard
encamped
under
the
command
of
ravaloke
without
the
walls
no
less
did
shibli
bagarag
honour
the
benefactor
of
noorna
making
him
chief
of
his
armies
and
he
with
his
own
hand
bestowed
on
the
good
old
warrior
the
dress
of
honour
presented
to
him
by
the
seven
sons
charactered
with
all
the
mysteries
of
aklis
a
marvel
lost
to
men
in
the
failure
to
master
the
illusion
now
dominating
earth
so
then
of
all
that
had
worshipped
shagpat
only
kadza
clung
to
him
and
she
departed
with
him
into
the
realms
of
rabesqurat
who
reigned
there
divided
against
herself
by
the
stroke
of
the
sword
the
queen
is
no
longer
mighty
for
the
widening
of
her
power
has
weakened
it
she
being
now
the
mistress
of
the
and
them
that
follow
one
idea
to
the
exclusion
of
a
second
the
failure
in
the
unveiling
of
her
illusion
was
in
the
succumbing
frailty
of
him
that
undertook
the
task
the
world
and
its
wise
men
having
come
to
the
belief
that
in
thwackings
there
was
ignominy
to
the
soul
of
man
and
a
tarnish
on
the
lustre
of
heroes
on
that
score
hear
the
words
of
the
poet
a
vain
protest
ye
that
nourish
hopes
of
fame
ye
who
would
be
known
in
song
ponder
old
history
and
duly
frame
your
souls
to
meek
acceptance
of
the
thong
lo
of
hundreds
who
aspire
eighties
tire
they
who
bear
up
in
spite
of
wrecks
and
wracks
were
season
by
celestial
hail
of
thwacks
fortune
in
this
mortal
race
builds
on
thwackings
for
its
base
thus
the
doth
make
a
flail
a
staff
and
separates
his
heavenly
corn
from
chaff
think
ye
had
he
never
known
noorna
a
belabouring
crone
shibli
bagarag
would
have
shaved
shagpat
the
unthwack
lives
in
chronicle
a
rat
is
the
thwacking
in
this
den
maketh
lions
of
true
men
so
are
we
nerved
to
break
the
clinging
mesh
which
tames
the
noblest
efforts
of
poor
flesh
feshnavat
became
the
master
vizier
and
abarak
remained
at
the
right
hand
of
shibli
bagarag
his
slave
in
great
adventure
no
other
condition
than
bondage
gave
peace
to
abarak
he
was
of
the
class
enumerated
by
the
sage
who
with
the
strength
of
giants
are
but
tools
the
weighty
hands
which
serve
selected
fools
now
this
was
how
it
was
in
the
case
of
baba
mustapha
and
the
four
kings
and
feshnavat
and
abarak
and
ravaloke
and
kadza
together
with
shagpat
but
in
the
case
of
noorna
bin
noorka
surely
she
was
withering
from
a
sting
of
the
scorpion
shot
against
her
bosom
but
the
seven
sons
of
aklis
gave
her
a
pass
into
aklis
on
the
wings
of
koorookh
and
gulrevaz
the
daughter
of
aklis
tended
her
she
that
was
alone
capable
of
restoring
her
and
counteracting
the
malice
of
the
scorpion
by
the
hand
of
purity
so
noorna
prospered
but
shibli
bagarag
drooped
in
uncertainty
of
her
state
and
was
as
a
reaper
in
a
field
of
harvest
around
whom
lie
the
yellow
sheaves
and
the
brown
beam
of
autumn
on
his
head
the
blaze
of
plenty
yet
is
he
joyless
and
stands
musing
for
one
is
away
who
should
be
there
and
without
whom
the
goblet
of
success
giveth
an
unsweetened
draught
and
there
is
nothing
pleasant
in
life
and
the
flower
on
the
summit
of
achievement
is
blighted
at
last
as
he
was
listlessly
dispensing
justice
in
the
great
hall
seven
days
after
the
mastery
of
the
event
lo
noorna
in
air
borne
by
gulrevaz
she
fair
and
fresh
in
the
revival
of
health
and
beauty
and
the
light
of
constant
love
of
her
entry
into
the
great
hall
to
the
embrace
of
her
betrothed
the
poet
exclaims
picturing
her
in
a
rapture
her
march
is
music
and
my
soul
obeys
each
motion
as
a
lute
to
cunning
fingers
i
see
the
earth
throb
for
her
as
she
sways
in
air
and
like
a
great
flower
lingers
heavily
over
all
as
loath
to
leave
what
loves
her
so
and
for
her
loss
would
grieve
but
oh
what
other
hand
than
heaven
can
paint
her
eyes
and
that
black
bow
from
which
their
lightning
pierces
afar
long
lustrous
eyes
that
faint
in
languor
or
with
stormy
passion
brightening
within
them
world
in
world
lights
up
from
sleep
and
gives
a
glimpse
of
the
eternal
deep
sigh
round
her
odorous
winds
and
envious
rose
so
vainly
envious
with
such
blushes
gifted
bow
to
her
die
strangled
with
jealous
throes
o
bulbul
when
she
sings
with
brow
uplifted
gather
her
happy
youth
and
for
thy
gain
thank
him
who
could
such
loveliness
ordain
surely
the
master
of
the
event
advanced
to
her
in
the
glory
of
a
sultan
and
seated
her
beside
him
in
majesty
and
their
contract
of
marriage
was
read
aloud
in
the
hall
and
witnessed
and
sealed
joyful
was
he
then
commenced
that
festival
which
lasted
forty
days
and
is
termed
the
festival
of
the
honours
of
hospitality
to
the
sons
of
aldis
wherein
the
of
the
palace
uruish
performed
wonders
in
his
science
and
menaced
the
renown
of
zrmack
the
of
king
shamshureen
even
so
the
confectioner
dob
excelled
himself
in
devices
and
inventions
and
his
genius
urged
him
to
depict
in
sugars
and
pastes
the
entire
adventures
of
shibli
bagarag
in
search
of
the
sword
honour
we
uruish
and
as
the
poet
sayeth
divide
not
this
fraternal
twain
one
are
they
and
one
should
for
ever
remain
as
to
sweet
close
in
fine
music
we
look
so
the
confectioner
follows
the
cook
and
one
of
the
sons
of
aklis
zaragal
beholding
this
masterpiece
of
dob
which
was
served
to
the
guests
in
the
great
hall
on
the
fortieth
evening
was
fair
to
exclaim
in
extemporaneous
verse
have
i
been
wafted
to
a
rise
of
banquet
spread
in
paradise
dower
with
consuming
powers
divine
that
i
who
have
not
fail
to
dine
and
greatly
fall
thus
upon
the
cater
and
wine
sedately
so
there
was
feasting
in
the
hall
and
in
the
city
and
over
earth
great
pledging
the
sovereign
of
