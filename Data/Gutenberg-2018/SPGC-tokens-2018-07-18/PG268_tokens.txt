the
octopus
a
story
of
california
by
frank
norris
book
chapter
i
just
after
passing
caraher
saloon
on
the
county
road
that
ran
south
from
bonneville
and
that
divided
the
broderson
ranch
from
that
of
los
muertos
presley
was
suddenly
aware
of
the
faint
and
prolonged
blowing
of
a
steam
whistle
that
he
knew
must
come
from
the
railroad
shops
near
the
depot
at
bonneville
in
starting
out
from
the
ranch
house
that
morning
he
had
forgotten
his
watch
and
was
now
perplexed
to
know
whether
the
whistle
was
blowing
for
twelve
or
for
one
he
hoped
the
former
early
that
morning
he
had
decided
to
make
a
long
excursion
through
the
neighbouring
country
partly
on
foot
and
partly
on
his
bicycle
and
now
noon
was
come
already
and
as
yet
he
had
hardly
started
as
he
was
leaving
the
house
after
breakfast
derrick
had
asked
him
to
go
for
the
mail
at
bonneville
and
he
had
not
been
able
to
refuse
he
took
a
firmer
hold
of
the
cork
grips
of
his
handlebars
the
road
being
in
a
wretched
condition
after
the
recent
hauling
of
the
crop
and
quickened
his
pace
he
told
himself
that
no
matter
what
the
time
was
he
would
not
stop
for
luncheon
at
the
ranch
house
but
would
push
on
to
guadalajara
and
have
a
spanish
dinner
at
solotari
as
he
had
originally
planned
there
had
not
been
much
of
a
crop
to
haul
that
year
half
of
the
wheat
on
the
broderson
ranch
had
failed
entirely
and
derrick
himself
had
hardly
raised
more
than
enough
to
supply
seed
for
the
winter
sowing
but
such
little
hauling
as
there
had
been
had
reduced
the
roads
thereabouts
to
a
lamentable
condition
and
during
the
dry
season
of
the
past
few
months
the
layer
of
dust
had
deepened
and
thickened
to
such
an
extent
that
more
than
once
presley
was
obliged
to
dismount
and
trudge
along
on
foot
pushing
his
bicycle
in
front
of
him
it
was
the
last
half
of
september
the
very
end
of
the
dry
season
and
all
tulare
county
all
the
vast
reaches
of
the
san
joaquin
valley
in
fact
all
south
central
california
was
bone
dry
parched
and
baked
and
crisped
after
four
months
of
cloudless
weather
when
the
day
seemed
always
at
noon
and
the
sun
blazed
white
hot
over
the
valley
from
the
coast
range
in
the
west
to
the
foothills
of
the
sierras
in
the
east
as
presley
drew
near
to
the
point
where
what
was
known
as
the
lower
road
struck
off
through
the
rancho
de
los
muertos
leading
on
to
guadalajara
he
came
upon
one
of
the
county
a
great
tower
of
wood
straddling
clumsily
on
its
four
uprights
by
the
roadside
since
the
day
of
its
completion
the
storekeepers
and
retailers
of
bonneville
had
painted
their
advertisements
upon
it
it
was
a
landmark
in
that
reach
of
level
fields
the
white
letters
upon
it
could
be
read
for
miles
a
stood
near
by
and
as
he
was
very
thirsty
presley
resolved
to
stop
for
a
moment
to
get
a
drink
he
drew
abreast
of
the
tank
and
halted
there
leaning
his
bicycle
against
the
fence
a
couple
of
men
in
white
overalls
were
repainting
the
surface
of
the
tank
seated
on
swinging
platforms
that
hung
by
hooks
from
the
roof
they
were
painting
a
sign
an
advertisement
it
was
all
but
finished
and
read
s
behrman
real
estate
mortgages
main
street
bonneville
opposite
the
post
on
the
that
stood
in
the
shadow
of
the
tank
was
another
freshly
painted
inscription
s
behrman
has
something
to
say
to
as
presley
straightened
up
after
drinking
from
the
faucet
at
one
end
of
the
the
itself
laboured
into
view
around
the
turn
of
the
lower
road
two
mules
and
two
horses
white
with
dust
strained
leisurely
in
the
traces
moving
at
a
snail
pace
their
limp
ears
marking
the
time
while
perched
high
upon
the
seat
under
a
yellow
cotton
wagon
umbrella
presley
recognised
hooven
one
of
tenants
a
german
whom
every
one
called
bismarck
an
excitable
little
man
with
a
perpetual
grievance
and
an
endless
flow
of
broken
english
hello
bismarck
said
presley
as
hooven
brought
his
team
to
a
standstill
by
the
tank
preparatory
to
refilling
yoost
der
men
i
look

cried
the
other
twisting
the
reins
around
the
brake
yoost
one
minute
you
wait
hey
i
wanta
talk
mit
presley
was
impatient
to
be
on
his
way
again
a
little
more
time
wasted
and
the
day
would
be
lost
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
management
of
the
ranch
and
if
hooven
wanted
any
advice
from
him
it
was
so
much
breath
wasted
these
uncouth
brutes
of
farmhands
and
petty
ranchers
grimed
with
the
soil
they
worked
upon
were
odious
to
him
beyond
words
never
could
he
feel
in
sympathy
with
them
nor
with
their
lives
their
ways
their
marriages
deaths
bickerings
and
all
the
monotonous
round
of
their
sordid
existence
well
you
must
be
quick
about
it
bismarck
he
answered
sharply
late
for
dinner
as
it
soh
now
two
minuten
und
i
be
mit
he
drew
down
the
overhanging
spout
of
the
tank
to
the
vent
in
the
circumference
of
the
cart
and
pulled
the
chain
that
let
out
the
water
then
he
climbed
down
from
the
seat
jumping
from
the
tire
of
the
wheel
and
taking
presley
by
the
arm
led
him
a
few
steps
down
the
road

or

bismarck
interrupted
presley
trying
to
draw
away
that
something
outside
of
me
but
hooven
was
not
to
be
put
off
no
doubt
he
had
been
meditating
his
speech
all
the
morning
formulating
his

preparing

on
a
sudden
the
water
in
the
cart
gushed
over
the
sides
from
the
vent
in
the
top
with
a
smart
sound
of
splashing
hooven
was
forced
to
turn
his
attention

he
climbed
back
to
his
seat
under
the
wagon
umbrella
and
as
he
started
his
team
again
with
great
cracks
of
his
long
whip
turned
to
the
painters
still
at
work
upon
the
sign
and
declared
with
some
defiance
sieben

yais

you

meanwhile
presley
had
turned
into
the
lower
road
he
was
now
on
derrick
land
division
no
i
or
as
it
was
called
the
home
ranch
of
the
great
los
muertos
rancho
the
road
was
better
here
the
dust
laid
after
the
passage
of
hooven
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
had
come
to
the
ranch
house
itself
with
its
white
picket
fence
its
few
flower
beds
and
grove
of
eucalyptus
trees
on
the
lawn
at
the
side
of
the
house
he
saw
harran
in
the
act
of
setting
out
the
automatic
sprinkler
in
the
shade
of
the
house
by
the
porch
were
two
or
three
of
the
greyhounds
part
of
the
pack
that
were
used
to
hunt
down
and
godfrey
harran
prize
deerhound
presley
wheeled
up
the
driveway
and
met
harran
by
the
harran
was
magnus
derrick
youngest
son
a
very
young
fellow
of
or
he
had
the
fine
carriage
that
marked
his
father
and
still
further
resembled
him
in
that
he
had
the
derrick
nose
and
prominent
such
as
one
sees
in
the
later
portraits
of
the
duke
of
wellington
he
was
blond
and
incessant
exposure
to
the
sun
had
instead
of
tanning
him
brown
merely
heightened
the
colour
of
his
cheeks
his
yellow
hair
had
a
tendency
to
curl
in
a
forward
direction
just
in
front
of
the
ears
beside
him
presley
made
the
sharpest
of
contrasts
presley
seemed
to
have
come
of
a
mixed
origin
appeared
to
have
a
nature
more
composite
a
temperament
more
complex
unlike
harran
derrick
he
seemed
more
of
a
character
than
a
type
the
sun
had
browned
his
face
till
it
was
almost
swarthy
his
eyes
were
a
dark
brown
and
his
forehead
was
the
forehead
of
the
intellectual
wide
and
high
with
a
certain
unmistakable
lift
about
it
that
argued
education
not
only
of
himself
but
of
his
people
before
him
the
impression
conveyed
by
his
mouth
and
chin
was
that
of
a
delicate
and
highly
sensitive
nature
the
lips
thin
and
loosely
shut
together
the
chin
small
and
rather
receding
one
guessed
that
refinement
had
been
gained
only
by
a
certain
loss
of
strength
one
expected
to
find
him
nervous
introspective
to
discover
that
his
mental
life
was
not
at
all
the
result
of
impressions
and
sensations
that
came
to
him
from
without
but
rather
of
thoughts
and
reflections
germinating
from
within
though
morbidly
sensitive
to
changes
in
his
physical
surroundings
he
would
be
slow
to
act
upon
such
sensations
would
not
prove
impulsive
not
because
he
was
sluggish
but
because
he
was
merely
irresolute
it
could
be
foreseen
that
morally
he
was
of
that
sort
who
avoid
evil
through
good
taste
lack
of
decision
and
want
of
opportunity
his
temperament
was
that
of
the
poet
when
he
told
himself
he
had
been
thinking
he
deceived
himself
he
had
on
such
occasions
been
only
brooding
some
eighteen
months
before
this
time
he
had
been
threatened
with
consumption
and
taking
advantage
of
a
standing
invitation
on
the
part
of
magnus
derrick
had
come
to
stay
in
the
dry
even
climate
of
the
san
joaquin
for
an
indefinite
length
of
time
he
was
thirty
years
old
and
had
graduated
and
with
high
honours
from
an
eastern
college
where
he
had
devoted
himself
to
a
passionate
study
of
literature
and
more
especially
of
poetry
it
was
his
insatiable
ambition
to
write
verse
but
up
to
this
time
his
work
had
been
fugitive
ephemeral
a
note
here
and
there
heard
appreciated
and
forgotten
he
was
in
search
of
a
subject
something
magnificent
he
did
not
know
exactly
what
some
vast
tremendous
theme
heroic
terrible
to
be
unrolled
in
all
the
thundering
progression
of
hexameters
but
whatever
he
wrote
and
in
whatever
fashion
presley
was
determined
that
his
poem
should
be
of
the
west
that
world
frontier
of
romance
where
a
new
race
a
new
people
hardy
brave
and
passionate
were
building
an
empire
where
the
tumultuous
life
ran
like
fire
from
dawn
to
dark
and
from
dark
to
dawn
again
primitive
brutal
honest
and
without
fear
something
to
his
idea
not
much
had
been
done
to
catch
at
that
life
in
passing
but
its
poet
had
not
yet
arisen
the
few
sporadic
attempts
thus
he
told
himself
had
only
touched
the
keynote
he
strove
for
the
diapason
the
great
song
that
should
embrace
in
itself
a
whole
epoch
a
complete
era
the
voice
of
an
entire
people
wherein
all
people
should
be
included
they
and
their
legends
their
folk
lore
their
fightings
their
loves
and
their
lusts
their
blunt
grim
humour
their
stoicism
under
stress
their
adventures
their
treasures
found
in
a
day
and
gambled
in
a
night
their
direct
crude
speech
their
generosity
and
cruelty
their
heroism
and
bestiality
their
religion
and
profanity
their
and
obscenity
a
true
and
fearless
setting
forth
of
a
passing
phase
of
history
sincere
each
group
in
its
proper
environment
the
valley
the
plain
and
the
mountain
the
ranch
the
range
and
the
mine
all
this
all
the
traits
and
types
of
every
community
from
the
dakotas
to
the
mexicos
from
winnipeg
to
guadalupe
gathered
together
swept
together
welded
and
riven
together
in
one
single
mighty
song
the
song
of
the
west
that
was
what
he
dreamed
while
things
without
names
thoughts
for
which
no
man
had
yet
invented
words
terrible
formless
shapes
vague
figures
colossal
monstrous
distorted
whirled
at
a
gallop
through
his
imagination
as
harran
came
up
presley
reached
down
into
the
pouches
of
the
shooting
coat
he
wore
and
drew
out
and
handed
him
the
packet
of
letters
and
papers
here
the
mail
i
think
i
shall
go
but
dinner
is
ready
said
harran
we
are
just
sitting
presley
shook
his
head
no
i
in
a
hurry
perhaps
i
shall
have
something
to
eat
at
guadalajara
i
shall
be
gone
all
he
delayed
a
few
moments
longer
tightening
a
loose
nut
on
his
forward
wheel
while
harran
recognising
his
father
handwriting
on
one
of
the
envelopes
slit
it
open
and
cast
his
eye
rapidly
over
its
pages
the
governor
is
coming
home
he
exclaimed
morning
on
the
early
train
wants
me
to
meet
him
with
the
team
at
guadalajara
and
he
cried
between
his
clenched
teeth
as
he
continued
to
read
we
lost
the
what
case
oh
in
the
matter
of
rates
harran
nodded
his
eyes
flashing
his
face
growing
suddenly
scarlet
ulsteen
gave
his
decision
yesterday
he
continued
reading
from
his
father
letter
he
holds
ulsteen
does
that
rates
as
low
as
the
new
figure
would
amount
to
confiscation
of
property
and
that
on
such
a
basis
the
railroad
could
not
be
operated
at
a
legitimate
profit
as
he
is
powerless
to
legislate
in
the
matter
he
can
only
put
the
rates
back
at
what
they
originally
were
before
the
commissioners
made
the
cut
and
it
is
so
ordered
that
our
friend
behrman
again
added
harran
grinding
his
teeth
he
was
up
in
the
city
the
whole
of
the
time
the
new
schedule
was
being
drawn
and
he
and
ulsteen
and
the
railroad
commission
were
as
thick
as
thieves
he
has
been
up
there
all
this
last
week
too
doing
the
railroad
dirty
work
and
backing
ulsteen
up
profit
legitimate
profit
he
broke
out
can
we
raise
wheat
at
a
legitimate
profit
with
a
tariff
of
four
dollars
a
ton
for
moving
it
two
hundred
miles
to
with
wheat
at
cents
why
not
hold
us
up
with
a
gun
in
our
faces
and
say
up
and
be
done
with
it
he
dug
his
into
the
ground
and
turned
away
to
the
house
abruptly
cursing
beneath
his
breath
by
the
way
presley
called
after
him
hooven
wants
to
see
you
he
asked
me
about
this
idea
of
the
governor
of
getting
along
without
the
tenants
this
year
hooven
wants
to
stay
to
tend
the
ditch
and
look
after
the
stock
i
told
him
to
see
harran
his
mind
full
of
other
things
nodded
to
say
he
understood
presley
only
waited
till
he
had
disappeared
indoors
so
that
he
might
not
seem
too
indifferent
to
his
trouble
then
remounting
struck
at
once
into
a
brisk
pace
and
turning
out
from
the
carriage
gate
held
on
swiftly
down
the
lower
road
going
in
the
direction
of
guadalajara
these
matters
these
eternal
fierce
bickerings
between
the
farmers
of
the
san
joaquin
and
the
pacific
and
southwestern
railroad
irritated
him
and
wearied
him
he
cared
for
none
of
these
things
they
did
not
belong
to
his
world
in
the
picture
of
that
huge
romantic
west
that
he
saw
in
his
imagination
these
dissensions
made
the
one
note
of
harsh
colour
that
refused
to
enter
into
the
great
scheme
of
harmony
it
was
material
sordid
deadly
commonplace
but
however
he
strove
to
shut
his
eyes
to
it
or
his
ears
to
it
the
thing
persisted
and
persisted
the
romance
seemed
complete
up
to
that
point
there
it
broke
there
it
failed
there
it
became
realism
grim
unlovely
unyielding
to
be
true
and
it
was
the
first
article
of
his
creed
to
be
unflinchingly
true
he
could
not
ignore
it
all
the
noble
poetry
of
the
ranch
the
valley
seemed
in
his
mind
to
be
marred
and
disfigured
by
the
presence
of
certain
immovable
facts
just
what
he
wanted
presley
hardly
knew
on
one
hand
it
was
his
ambition
to
portray
life
as
he
saw
it
directly
frankly
and
through
no
medium
of
personality
or
temperament
but
on
the
other
hand
as
well
he
wished
to
see
everything
through
a
mist
a
mist
that
dulled
all
harsh
outlines
all
crude
and
violent
colours
he
told
himself
that
as
a
part
of
the
people
he
loved
the
people
and
sympathised
with
their
hopes
and
fears
and
joys
and
griefs
and
yet
hooven
grimy
and
perspiring
with
his
perpetual
grievance
and
his
contracted
horizon
only
revolted
him
he
had
set
himself
the
task
of
giving
true
absolutely
true
poetical
expression
to
the
life
of
the
ranch
and
yet
again
and
again
he
brought
up
against
the
railroad
that
stubborn
iron
barrier
against
which
his
romance
shattered
itself
to
froth
and
disintegrated
flying
spume
his
heart
went
out
to
the
people
and
his
groping
hand
met
that
of
a
slovenly
little
dutchman
whom
it
was
impossible
to
consider
seriously
he
searched
for
the
true
romance
and
in
the
end
found
grain
rates
and
unjust
freight
tariffs
but
the
stuff
is
here
he
muttered
as
he
sent
his
wheel
rumbling
across
the
bridge
over
broderson
creek
the
romance
the
real
romance
is
here
somewhere
i
get
hold
of
it
he
shot
a
glance
about
him
as
if
in
search
of
the
inspiration
by
now
he
was
not
quite
half
way
across
the
northern
and
narrowest
corner
of
los
muertos
at
this
point
some
eight
miles
wide
he
was
still
on
the
home
ranch
a
few
miles
to
the
south
he
could
just
make
out
the
line
of
wire
fence
that
separated
it
from
the
third
division
and
to
the
north
seen
faint
and
blue
through
the
haze
and
shimmer
of
the
noon
sun
a
long
file
of
telegraph
poles
showed
the
line
of
the
railroad
and
marked
northeast
boundary
the
road
over
which
presley
was
travelling
ran
almost
diametrically
straight
in
front
of
him
but
at
a
great
distance
he
could
make
out
the
giant
and
the
red
roof
of
hooven
barn
that
stood
near
it
all
about
him
the
country
was
flat
in
all
directions
he
could
see
for
miles
the
harvest
was
just
over
nothing
but
stubble
remained
on
the
ground
with
the
one
exception
of
the
by
hooven
place
there
was
nothing
green
in
sight
the
wheat
stubble
was
of
a
dirty
yellow
the
ground
parched
cracked
and
dry
of
a
cheerless
brown
by
the
roadside
the
dust
lay
thick
and
grey
and
on
either
hand
stretching
on
toward
the
horizon
losing
itself
in
a
mere
smudge
in
the
distance
ran
the
illimitable
parallels
of
the
wire
fence
and
that
was
all
that
and
the
blue
of
the
sky
and
the
steady
shimmer
of
the
heat
the
silence
was
infinite
after
the
harvest
small
though
that
harvest
had
been
the
ranches
seemed
asleep
it
was
as
though
the
earth
after
its
period
of
reproduction
its
pains
of
labour
had
been
delivered
of
the
fruit
of
its
loins
and
now
slept
the
sleep
of
exhaustion
it
was
the
period
between
seasons
when
nothing
was
being
done
when
the
natural
forces
seemed
to
hang
suspended
there
was
no
rain
there
was
no
wind
there
was
no
growth
no
life
the
very
stubble
had
no
force
even
to
rot
the
sun
alone
moved
toward
two
presley
reached
hooven
place
two
or
three
grimy
frame
buildings
infested
with
a
swarm
of
dogs
a
hog
or
two
wandered
aimlessly
about
under
a
shed
by
the
barn
a
seeder
lay
rusting
to
its
ruin
but
overhead
a
mammoth
the
largest
tree
in
all
the
towered
superb
and
magnificent
grey
bunches
of
mistletoe
and
festoons
of
trailing
moss
hung
from
its
bark
from
its
lowest
branch
hung
hooven
a
square
box
faced
with
wire
screens
what
gave
a
special
interest
to
hooven
was
the
fact
that
here
was
the
intersection
of
the
lower
road
and
derrick
main
irrigating
ditch
a
vast
trench
not
yet
completed
which
he
and
annixter
who
worked
the
quien
sabe
ranch
were
jointly
constructing
it
ran
directly
across
the
road
and
at
right
angles
to
it
and
lay
a
deep
groove
in
the
field
between
hooven
and
the
town
of
guadalajara
some
three
miles
farther
on
besides
this
the
ditch
was
a
natural
boundary
between
two
divisions
of
the
los
muertos
ranch
the
first
and
fourth
presley
now
had
the
choice
of
two
routes
his
objective
point
was
the
spring
at
the
headwaters
of
broderson
creek
in
the
hills
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
quien
sabe
ranch
the
trail
afforded
him
a
short
cut
thitherward
as
he
passed
the
house
hooven
came
to
the
door
her
little
daughter
hilda
dressed
in
a
boy
overalls
and
clumsy
boots
at
her
skirts
minna
her
oldest
daughter
a
very
pretty
girl
whose
love
affairs
were
continually
the
talk
of
all
los
muertos
was
visible
through
a
window
of
the
house
busy
at
the
week
washing
hooven
was
a
faded
colourless
woman
and
commonplace
and
offering
not
the
least
characteristic
that
would
distinguish
her
from
a
thousand
other
women
of
her
class
and
kind
she
nodded
to
presley
watching
him
with
a
stolid
gaze
from
under
her
arm
which
she
held
across
her
forehead
to
shade
her
eyes
but
now
presley
exerted
himself
in
good
earnest
his
bicycle
flew
he
resolved
that
after
all
he
would
go
to
guadalajara
he
crossed
the
bridge
over
the
irrigating
ditch
with
a
brusque
spurt
of
hollow
sound
and
shot
forward
down
the
last
stretch
of
the
lower
road
that
yet
intervened
between
hooven
and
the
town
he
was
on
the
fourth
division
of
the
ranch
now
the
only
one
whereon
the
wheat
had
been
successful
no
doubt
because
of
the
little
mission
creek
that
ran
through
it
but
he
no
longer
occupied
himself
with
the
landscape
his
only
concern
was
to
get
on
as
fast
as
possible
he
had
looked
forward
to
spending
nearly
the
whole
day
on
the
crest
of
the
wooded
hills
in
the
northern
corner
of
the
quien
sabe
ranch
reading
idling
smoking
his
pipe
but
now
he
would
do
well
if
he
arrived
there
by
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
in
a
few
moments
he
had
reached
the
line
fence
that
marked
the
limits
of
the
ranch
here
were
the
railroad
tracks
and
just
beyond
a
huddled
mass
of
roofs
with
here
and
there
an
adobe
house
on
its
outskirts
the
little
town
of
guadalajara
nearer
at
hand
and
directly
in
front
of
presley
were
the
freight
and
passenger
depots
of
the
and
painted
in
the
grey
and
white
which
seemed
to
be
the
official
colours
of
all
the
buildings
owned
by
the
corporation
the
station
was
deserted
no
trains
passed
at
this
hour
from
the
direction
of
the
ticket
window
presley
heard
the
unsteady
chittering
of
the
telegraph
key
in
the
shadow
of
one
of
the
baggage
trucks
upon
the
platform
the
great
yellow
cat
that
belonged
to
the
agent
dozed
complacently
her
paws
tucked
under
her
body
three
flat
cars
loaded
with
farming
machines
were
on
the
siding
above
the
station
while
on
the
switch
below
a
huge
freight
engine
that
lacked
its
sat
back
upon
its
monstrous
motionless
solid
drawing
long
breaths
that
were
punctuated
by
the
subdued
sound
of
its
clicking
at
exact
intervals
but
evidently
it
had
been
decreed
that
presley
should
be
stopped
at
every
point
of
his
ride
that
day
for
as
he
was
pushing
his
bicycle
across
the
tracks
he
was
surprised
to
hear
his
name
called
hello
there
presley
what
the
good
word
presley
looked
up
quickly
and
saw
dyke
the
engineer
leaning
on
his
folded
arms
from
the
cab
window
of
the
freight
engine
but
at
the
prospect
of
this
further
delay
presley
was
less
troubled
dyke
and
he
were
well
acquainted
and
the
best
of
friends
the
picturesqueness
of
the
engineer
life
was
always
attractive
to
presley
and
more
than
once
he
had
ridden
on
dyke
engine
between
guadalajara
and
bonneville
once
even
he
had
made
the
entire
run
between
the
latter
town
and
san
francisco
in
the
cab
dyke
home
was
in
guadalajara
he
lived
in
one
of
the
remodelled
cottages
where
his
mother
kept
house
for
him
his
wife
had
died
some
five
years
before
this
time
leaving
him
a
little
daughter
sidney
to
bring
up
as
best
he
could
dyke
himself
was
a
heavy
built
fellow
nearly
twice
the
weight
of
presley
with
great
shoulders
and
massive
hairy
arms
and
a
tremendous
rumbling
voice
hello
old
man
answered
presley
coming
up
to
the
engine
what
are
you
doing
about
here
at
this
time
of
day
i
thought
you
were
on
the
night
service
this
we
changed
about
a
bit
answered
the
other
come
up
here
and
sit
down
and
get
out
of
the
sun
they
held
us
here
to
wait
orders
he
explained
as
presley
after
leaning
his
bicycle
against
the
tender
climbed
to
the
fireman
seat
of
worn
green
leather
they
are
changing
the
run
of
one
of
the
crack
passenger
engines
down
below
and
are
sending
her
up
to
fresno
there
was
a
smash
of
some
kind
on
the
bakersfield
division
and
she
to
hell
and
gone
behind
her
time
i
suppose
when
she
comes
she
come
it
will
be
stand
clear
and
an
open
track
all
the
way
to
fresno
they
have
held
me
here
to
let
her
go
he
took
his
pipe
an
old
clay
but
coloured
to
a
beautiful
shiny
black
from
the
pocket
of
his
jumper
and
filled
and
lit
it
well
i
do
suppose
you
object
to
being
held
here
observed
presley
gives
you
a
chance
to
visit
your
mother
and
the
little
and
precisely
they
choose
this
day
to
go
up
to
sacramento
answered
dyke
just
my
luck
went
up
to
visit
my
brother
people
by
the
way
my
brother
may
come
down
here
locate
here
i
mean
and
go
into
the
business
he
got
an
option
on
five
hundred
acres
just
back
of
the
town
here
he
says
there
is
going
to
be
money
in
hops
i
know
may
be
i
go
in
with
why
what
the
matter
with
railroading
dyke
drew
a
couple
of
puffs
on
his
pipe
and
fixed
presley
with
a
glance
there
this
the
matter
with
it
he
said
i
fired
you
exclaimed
presley
turning
abruptly
toward
him
what
i
telling
you
returned
dyke
grimly
you
do
mean
it
why
what
for
dyke
now
you
tell
me
what
for
growled
the
other
savagely
boy
and
man
i
worked
for
the
and
for
over
ten
years
and
never
one
yelp
of
a
complaint
did
i
ever
hear
from
them
they
know
damn
well
not
got
a
steadier
man
on
the
road
and
more
than
that
more
than
that
i
do
belong
to
the
brotherhood
and
when
the
strike
came
along
i
stood
by
them
stood
by
the
company
you
know
that
and
you
know
and
they
know
that
at
sacramento
that
time
i
ran
my
train
according
to
schedule
with
a
gun
in
each
hand
never
knowing
when
i
was
going
over
a
mined
culvert
and
there
was
talk
of
giving
me
a
gold
watch
at
the
time
to
hell
with
their
gold
watches
i
want
ordinary
justice
and
fair
treatment
and
now
when
hard
times
come
along
and
they
are
cutting
wages
what
do
they
do
do
they
make
any
discrimination
in
my
case
do
they
remember
the
man
that
stood
by
them
and
risked
his
life
in
their
service
no
they
cut
my
pay
down
just
as
as
they
do
the
pay
of
any
dirty
little
wiper
in
the
yard
cut
me
along
with
listen
to
this
cut
me
along
with
men
that
they
had
strikers
that
they
took
back
because
they
were
short
of
he
drew
fiercely
on
his
pipe
i
went
to
them
yes
i
did
i
went
to
the
general
office
and
ate
dirt
i
told
them
i
was
a
family
man
and
that
i
did
see
how
i
was
going
to
get
along
on
the
new
scale
and
i
reminded
them
of
my
service
during
the
strike
the
swine
told
me
that
it
would
be
fair
to
discriminate
in
favour
of
one
man
and
that
the
cut
must
apply
to
all
their
employees
alike
fair
he
shouted
with
laughter
fair
hear
the
and
talking
about
fairness
and
discrimination
that
good
that
is
well
i
got
furious
i
was
a
fool
i
suppose
i
told
them
that
in
justice
to
myself
i
would
do
work
for
pay
and
they
said
dyke
you
know
what
you
can
do
well
i
did
know
i
said
ask
for
my
time
if
you
please
and
they
gave
it
to
me
just
as
if
they
were
glad
to
be
shut
of
me
so
there
you
are
presley
that
the
railroad
company
of
california
i
am
on
my
last
run
shameful
declared
presley
his
sympathies
all
aroused
now
that
the
trouble
concerned
a
friend
of
his
it
shameful
dyke
but
he
added
an
idea
occurring
to
him
that
do
shut
you
out
from
work
there
are
other
railroads
in
the
state
that
are
not
controlled
by
the
and
dyke
smote
his
knee
with
his
clenched
fist
name
presley
was
silent
dyke
challenge
was
unanswerable
there
was
a
lapse
in
their
talk
presley
drumming
on
the
arm
of
the
seat
meditating
on
this
injustice
dyke
looking
off
over
the
fields
beyond
the
town
his
frown
lowering
his
teeth
rasping
upon
his
pipestem
the
station
agent
came
to
the
door
of
the
depot
stretching
and
yawning
on
ahead
of
the
engine
the
empty
rails
of
the
track
reaching
out
toward
the
horizon
threw
off
visible
layers
of
heat
the
telegraph
key
clicked
incessantly
so
i
going
to
quit
dyke
remarked
after
a
while
his
anger
somewhat
subsided
my
brother
and
i
will
take
up
this
hop
ranch
i
saved
a
good
deal
in
the
last
ten
years
and
there
ought
to
be
money
in
presley
went
on
remounting
his
bicycle
wheeling
silently
through
the
deserted
streets
of
the
decayed
and
dying
mexican
town
it
was
the
hour
of
the
siesta
nobody
was
about
there
was
no
business
in
the
town
it
was
too
close
to
bonneville
for
that
before
the
railroad
came
and
in
the
days
when
the
raising
of
cattle
was
the
great
industry
of
the
country
it
had
enjoyed
a
fierce
and
brilliant
life
now
it
was
moribund
the
drug
store
the
two
the
hotel
at
the
corner
of
the
old
plaza
and
the
shops
where
mexican
curios
were
sold
to
those
occasional
eastern
tourists
who
came
to
visit
the
mission
of
san
juan
sufficed
for
the
town
activity
at
solotari
the
restaurant
on
the
plaza
diagonally
across
from
the
hotel
presley
ate
his
mexican
dinner
an
omelette
in
style
frijoles
and
tortillas
a
salad
and
a
glass
of
white
wine
in
a
corner
of
the
room
during
the
whole
course
of
his
dinner
two
young
mexicans
one
of
whom
was
astonishingly
handsome
after
the
melodramatic
fashion
of
his
race
and
an
old
fellow
the
centenarian
of
the
town
decrepit
beyond
belief
sang
an
interminable
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
guitar
and
an
accordion
these
decayed
picturesque
vicious
and
romantic
never
failed
to
interest
presley
a
few
of
them
still
remained
in
guadalajara
drifting
from
the
saloon
to
the
restaurant
and
from
the
restaurant
to
the
plaza
relics
of
a
former
generation
standing
for
a
different
order
of
things
absolutely
idle
living
god
knew
how
happy
with
their
cigarette
their
guitar
their
glass
of
mescal
and
their
siesta
the
centenarian
remembered
fremont
and
governor
alvarado
and
the
bandit
jesus
tejeda
and
the
days
when
los
muertos
was
a
spanish
grant
a
veritable
principality
leagues
in
extent
and
when
there
was
never
a
fence
from
visalia
to
fresno
upon
this
occasion
presley
offered
the
old
man
a
drink
of
mescal
and
excited
him
to
talk
of
the
things
he
remembered
their
talk
was
in
spanish
a
language
with
which
presley
was
familiar
de
la
cuesta
held
the
grant
of
los
muertos
in
those
days
the
centenarian
said
a
grand
man
he
had
the
power
of
life
and
death
over
his
people
and
there
was
no
law
but
his
word
there
was
no
thought
of
wheat
then
you
may
believe
it
was
all
cattle
in
those
days
sheep
horses
steers
not
so
many
and
if
money
was
scarce
there
was
always
plenty
to
eat
and
clothes
enough
for
all
and
wine
ah
yes
by
the
vat
and
oil
too
the
mission
fathers
had
that
yes
and
there
was
wheat
as
well
now
that
i
come
to
think
but
a
very
little
in
the
field
north
of
the
mission
where
now
it
is
the
seed
ranch
wheat
fields
were
there
and
also
a
vineyard
all
on
mission
grounds
wheat
olives
and
the
vine
the
fathers
planted
those
to
provide
the
elements
of
the
holy
sacrament
bread
oil
and
wine
you
understand
it
was
like
that
those
industries
began
in
california
from
the
church
and
now
he
put
his
chin
in
the
air
what
would
father
ullivari
have
said
to
such
a
crop
as
senor
derrick
plants
these
days
ten
thousand
acres
of
wheat
nothing
but
wheat
from
the
sierra
to
the
coast
range
i
remember
when
de
la
cuesta
was
married
he
had
never
seen
the
young
lady
only
her
miniature
portrait
painted
he
raised
a
shoulder
i
do
not
know
by
whom
small
a
little
thing
to
be
held
in
the
palm
but
he
fell
in
love
with
that
and
marry
her
he
would
the
affair
was
arranged
between
him
and
the
girl
parents
but
when
the
time
came
that
de
la
cuesta
was
to
go
to
monterey
to
meet
and
marry
the
girl
behold
jesus
tejeda
broke
in
upon
the
small
rancheros
near
terrabella
it
was
no
time
for
de
la
cuesta
to
be
away
so
he
sent
his
brother
esteban
to
monterey
to
marry
the
girl
by
proxy
for
him
i
went
with
esteban
we
were
a
company
nearly
a
hundred
men
and
de
la
cuesta
sent
a
horse
for
the
girl
to
ride
white
pure
white
and
the
saddle
was
of
red
leather
the
the
bit
and
buckles
all
the
metal
work
of
virgin
silver
well
there
was
a
ceremony
in
the
monterey
mission
and
esteban
in
the
name
of
his
brother
was
married
to
the
girl
on
our
way
back
de
la
cuesta
rode
out
to
meet
us
his
company
met
ours
at
agatha
dos
palos
never
will
i
forget
de
la
cuesta
face
as
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
girl
it
was
a
look
a
glance
come
and
gone
like
that
he
snapped
his
fingers
no
one
but
i
saw
it
but
i
was
close
by
there
was
no
mistaking
that
look
de
la
cuesta
was
and
the
girl
demanded
presley
she
never
knew
ah
he
was
a
grand
gentleman
de
la
cuesta
always
he
treated
her
as
a
queen
never
was
husband
more
devoted
more
respectful
more
chivalrous
but
love
the
old
fellow
put
his
chin
in
the
air
shutting
his
eyes
in
a
knowing
fashion
it
was
not
there
i
could
tell
they
were
married
over
again
at
the
mission
san
juan
de
guadalajara
our
mission
and
for
a
week
all
the
town
of
guadalajara
was
in
fete
there
were
in
the
plaza
this
very
one
for
five
days
and
to
each
of
his
de
la
cuesta
gave
a
horse
a
barrel
of
tallow
an
ounce
of
silver
and
half
an
ounce
of
gold
dust
ah
those
were
days
that
was
a
gay
life
this
he
made
a
comprehensive
gesture
with
his
left
hand
this
is
you
may
well
say
that
observed
presley
moodily
discouraged
by
the
other
talk
all
his
doubts
and
uncertainty
had
returned
to
him
never
would
he
grasp
the
subject
of
his
great
poem
the
life
was
colourless
romance
was
dead
he
had
lived
too
late
to
write
of
the
past
was
not
what
he
desired
reality
was
what
he
longed
for
things
that
he
had
seen
yet
how
to
make
this
compatible
with
romance
he
rose
putting
on
his
hat
offering
the
old
man
a
cigarette
the
centenarian
accepted
with
the
air
of
a
grandee
and
extended
his
horn
presley
shook
his
head
i
was
born
too
late
for
that
he
declared
for
that
and
for
many
other
things
you
are
travelling
senor
a
little
turn
through
the
country
to
get
the
kinks
out
of
the
muscles
presley
answered
i
go
up
into
the
quien
sabe
into
the
high
country
beyond
the
ah
the
quien
sabe
rancho
the
sheep
are
grazing
there
this
solotari
the
keeper
of
the
restaurant
explained
young
annixter
sold
his
wheat
stubble
on
the
ground
to
the
sheep
raisers
off
yonder
he
motioned
eastward
toward
the
sierra
foothills
since
sunday
the
herd
has
been
down
very
clever
that
young
annixter
he
gets
a
price
for
his
stubble
which
else
he
would
have
to
burn
and
also
manures
his
land
as
the
sheep
move
from
place
to
place
a
true
yankee
that
annixter
a
good
after
his
meal
presley
once
more
mounted
his
bicycle
and
leaving
the
restaurant
and
the
plaza
behind
him
held
on
through
the
main
street
of
the
drowsing
town
the
street
that
farther
on
developed
into
the
road
which
turned
abruptly
northward
and
led
onward
through
the
and
the
quien
sabe
ranch
toward
the
mission
of
san
juan
the
home
ranch
of
the
quien
sabe
was
in
the
little
triangle
bounded
on
the
south
by
the
railroad
on
the
northwest
by
broderson
creek
and
on
the
east
by
the
hop
fields
and
the
mission
lands
it
was
traversed
in
all
directions
now
by
the
trail
from
hooven
now
by
the
irrigating
ditch
the
same
which
presley
had
crossed
earlier
in
the
day
and
again
by
the
road
upon
which
presley
then
found
himself
in
its
centre
were
annixter
ranch
house
and
barns
topped
by
the
tower
of
the
artesian
well
that
was
to
feed
the
irrigating
ditch
farther
on
the
course
of
broderson
creek
was
marked
by
a
curved
line
of
willows
while
on
the
low
hills
to
the
north
as
presley
advanced
the
ancient
mission
of
san
juan
de
guadalajara
with
its
belfry
tower
and
roof
began
to
show
itself
over
the
crests
of
the
venerable
pear
trees
that
clustered
in
its
garden
when
presley
reached
annixter
ranch
house
he
found
young
annixter
himself
stretched
in
his
hammock
behind
the
on
the
front
porch
reading
david
copperfield
and
gorging
himself
with
dried
prunes
annixter
after
the
two
had
exchanged
greetings
complained
of
terrific
colics
all
the
preceding
night
his
stomach
was
out
of
whack
but
you
bet
he
knew
how
to
take
care
of
himself
the
last
spell
he
had
consulted
a
doctor
at
bonneville
a
gibbering
who
had
filled
him
up
to
the
neck
with
a
dose
of
some
hogwash
stuff
that
had
made
him
worse
a
healthy
lot
the
doctors
knew
anyhow
his
case
was
peculiar
he
knew
prunes
were
what
he
needed
and
by
the
pound
annixter
who
worked
the
quien
sabe
ranch
some
four
thousand
acres
of
rich
clay
and
heavy
loams
was
a
very
young
man
younger
even
than
presley
like
him
a
college
graduate
he
looked
never
a
year
older
than
he
was
he
was
and
lean
built
but
his
youthful
appearance
was
offset
by
a
certain
male
cast
of
countenance
the
lower
lip
thrust
out
the
chin
large
and
deeply
cleft
his
university
course
had
hardened
rather
than
polished
him
he
still
remained
one
of
the
people
rough
almost
to
insolence
direct
in
speech
intolerant
in
his
opinions
relying
upon
absolutely
no
one
but
himself
yet
with
all
this
of
an
astonishing
degree
of
intelligence
and
possessed
of
an
executive
ability
little
short
of
positive
genius
he
was
a
ferocious
worker
allowing
himself
no
pleasures
and
exacting
the
same
degree
of
energy
from
all
his
subordinates
he
was
widely
hated
and
as
widely
trusted
every
one
spoke
of
his
crusty
temper
and
bullying
disposition
invariably
qualifying
the
statement
with
a
commendation
of
his
resources
and
capabilities
the
devil
of
a
driver
a
hard
man
to
get
along
with
obstinate
contrary
cantankerous
but
brains
no
doubt
of
that
brains
to
his
boots
one
would
like
to
see
the
man
who
could
get
ahead
of
him
on
a
deal
twice
he
had
been
shot
at
once
from
ambush
on
ranch
and
once
by
one
of
his
own
men
whom
he
had
kicked
from
the
sacking
platform
of
his
harvester
for
gross
negligence
at
college
he
had
specialised
on
finance
political
economy
and
scientific
agriculture
after
his
graduation
he
stood
almost
at
the
very
top
of
his
class
he
had
returned
and
obtained
the
degree
of
civil
engineer
then
suddenly
he
had
taken
a
notion
that
a
practical
knowledge
of
law
was
indispensable
to
a
modern
farmer
in
eight
months
he
did
the
work
of
three
years
studying
for
his
bar
examinations
his
method
of
study
was
characteristic
he
reduced
all
the
material
of
his
to
notes
tearing
out
the
leaves
of
these
he
pasted
them
upon
the
walls
of
his
room
then
in
his
a
cheap
cigar
in
his
teeth
his
hands
in
his
pockets
he
walked
around
and
around
the
room
scowling
fiercely
at
his
notes
memorising
devouring
digesting
at
intervals
he
drank
great
cupfuls
of
unsweetened
black
coffee
when
the
bar
examinations
were
held
he
was
admitted
at
the
very
head
of
all
the
applicants
and
was
complimented
by
the
judge
immediately
afterwards
he
collapsed
with
nervous
prostration
his
stomach
got
out
of
whack
and
he
all
but
died
in
a
sacramento
obstinately
refusing
to
have
anything
to
do
with
doctors
whom
he
vituperated
as
a
rabble
of
quacks
dosing
himself
with
a
patent
medicine
and
stuffing
himself
almost
to
bursting
with
liver
pills
and
dried
prunes
he
had
taken
a
trip
to
europe
after
this
sickness
to
put
himself
completely
to
rights
he
intended
to
be
gone
a
year
but
returned
at
the
end
of
six
weeks
fulminating
abuse
of
european
cooking
nearly
his
entire
time
had
been
spent
in
paris
but
of
this
sojourn
he
had
brought
back
but
two
souvenirs
an
and
an
empty
bird
cage
which
had
tickled
his
fancy
immensely
he
was
wealthy
only
a
year
previous
to
this
his
father
a
widower
who
had
amassed
a
fortune
in
land
speculation
had
died
and
annixter
the
only
son
had
come
into
the
inheritance
for
presley
annixter
professed
a
great
admiration
holding
in
deep
respect
the
man
who
could
rhyme
words
deferring
to
him
whenever
there
was
question
of
literature
or
works
of
fiction
no
doubt
there
was
not
much
use
in
poetry
and
as
for
novels
to
his
mind
there
were
only
dickens
works
everything
else
was
a
lot
of
lies
but
just
the
same
it
took
brains
to
grind
out
a
poem
it
was
every
one
who
could
rhyme
brave
and
glaive
and
make
sense
out
of
it
sure
not
but
presley
case
was
a
notable
exception
on
no
occasion
was
annixter
prepared
to
accept
another
man
opinion
without
reserve
in
conversation
with
him
it
was
almost
impossible
to
make
any
direct
statement
however
trivial
that
he
would
accept
without
either
modification
or
open
contradiction
he
had
a
passion
for
violent
discussion
he
would
argue
upon
every
subject
in
the
range
of
human
knowledge
from
astronomy
to
the
tariff
from
the
doctrine
of
predestination
to
the
height
of
a
horse
never
would
he
admit
himself
to
be
mistaken
when
cornered
he
would
intrench
himself
behind
the
remark
yes
that
all
very
well
in
some
ways
it
is
and
then
again
in
some
ways
it
singularly
enough
he
and
presley
were
the
best
of
friends
more
than
once
presley
marvelled
at
this
state
of
affairs
telling
himself
that
he
and
annixter
had
nothing
in
common
in
all
his
circle
of
acquaintances
presley
was
the
one
man
with
whom
annixter
had
never
quarrelled
the
two
men
were
diametrically
opposed
in
temperament
presley
was
annixter
alert
presley
was
a
confirmed
dreamer
irresolute
inactive
with
a
strong
tendency
to
melancholy
the
young
farmer
was
a
man
of
affairs
decisive
combative
whose
only
reflection
upon
his
interior
economy
was
a
morbid
concern
in
the
vagaries
of
his
stomach
yet
the
two
never
met
without
a
mutual
pleasure
taking
a
genuine
interest
in
each
other
affairs
and
often
putting
themselves
to
great
inconvenience
to
be
of
trifling
service
to
help
one
another
as
a
last
characteristic
annixter
pretended
to
be
a
for
no
other
reason
than
that
he
was
a
very
of
awkwardness
in
feminine
surroundings
feemales
rot
there
was
a
fine
way
for
a
man
to
waste
his
time
and
his
good
money
lally
gagging
with
a
lot
of
feemales
no
thank
you
none
of
it
in
his
if
you
please
once
only
he
had
an
affair
a
timid
little
creature
in
a
establishment
in
sacramento
whom
he
had
picked
up
heaven
knew
how
after
his
return
to
his
ranch
a
correspondence
had
been
maintained
between
the
two
annixter
taking
the
precaution
to
typewrite
his
letters
and
never
affixing
his
signature
in
an
excess
of
prudence
he
furthermore
made
carbon
copies
of
all
his
letters
filing
them
away
in
a
compartment
of
his
safe
ah
it
would
be
a
clever
feemale
who
would
get
him
into
a
mess
then
suddenly
smitten
with
a
panic
terror
that
he
had
committed
himself
that
he
was
involving
himself
too
deeply
he
had
abruptly
sent
the
little
woman
about
her
business
it
was
his
only
love
affair
after
that
he
kept
himself
free
no
petticoats
should
ever
have
a
hold
on
him
sure
not
as
presley
came
up
to
the
edge
of
the
porch
pushing
his
bicycle
in
front
of
him
annixter
excused
himself
for
not
getting
up
alleging
that
the
cramps
returned
the
moment
he
was
off
his
back
what
are
you
doing
up
this
way
he
demanded
oh
just
having
a
look
around
answered
presley
how
the
ranch
say
observed
the
other
ignoring
his
question
what
this
i
hear
about
derrick
giving
his
tenants
the
bounce
and
working
los
muertos
himself
working
all
his
land
presley
made
a
sharp
movement
of
impatience
with
his
free
hand
heard
nothing
else
myself
since
morning
i
suppose
it
must
be
huh
grunted
annixter
spitting
out
a
prune
stone
you
give
magnus
derrick
my
compliments
and
tell
him
he
a
what
do
you
mean
i
suppose
derrick
thinks
he
still
running
his
mine
and
that
the
same
principles
will
apply
to
getting
grain
out
of
the
earth
as
to
getting
gold
oh
let
him
go
on
and
see
where
he
brings
up
that
right
there
your
western
farmer
he
exclaimed
contemptuously
get
the
guts
out
of
your
land
work
it
to
death
never
give
it
a
rest
never
alternate
your
crop
and
then
when
your
soil
is
exhausted
sit
down
and
roar
about
hard
i
suppose
magnus
thinks
the
land
has
had
rest
enough
these
last
two
dry
seasons
observed
presley
he
has
raised
no
crop
to
speak
of
for
two
years
the
land
has
had
a
good
ah
yes
that
sounds
well
annixter
contradicted
unwilling
to
be
convinced
in
a
way
the
land
been
rested
and
then
again
in
a
way
it
but
presley
scenting
an
argument
refrained
from
answering
and
bethought
himself
of
moving
on
i
going
to
leave
my
wheel
here
for
a
while
buck
he
said
if
you
do
mind
i
going
up
to
the
spring
and
the
road
is
rough
between
here
and
stop
in
for
dinner
on
your
way
back
said
annixter
there
be
a
venison
steak
one
of
the
boys
got
a
deer
over
in
the
foothills
last
week
out
of
season
but
never
mind
that
i
ca
eat
it
this
stomach
of
mine
would
digest
sweet
oil
get
here
about
well
maybe
i
will
thank
you
said
presley
moving
off
by
the
way
he
added
i
see
your
barn
is
about
you
bet
answered
annixter
in
about
a
fortnight
now
she
be
all
it
a
big
barn
murmured
presley
glancing
around
the
angle
of
the
house
toward
where
the
great
structure
stood
guess
we
have
to
have
a
dance
there
before
we
move
the
stock
in
observed
annixter
that
the
custom
all
around
presley
took
himself
off
but
at
the
gate
annixter
called
after
him
his
mouth
full
of
prunes
say
take
a
look
at
that
herd
of
sheep
as
you
go
up
they
are
right
off
here
to
the
east
of
the
road
about
half
a
mile
from
here
i
guess
that
the
biggest
lot
of
sheep
you
ever
saw
you
might
write
a
poem
about
lamb
ram
sheep
graze
sunny
days
catch
on
beyond
broderson
creek
as
presley
advanced
tramping
along
on
foot
now
the
land
opened
out
again
into
the
same
vast
spaces
of
dull
brown
earth
sprinkled
with
stubble
such
as
had
been
characteristic
of
ranch
to
the
east
the
reach
seemed
infinite
flat
cheerless
unrolling
like
a
gigantic
scroll
toward
the
faint
shimmer
of
the
distant
horizons
with
here
and
there
an
isolated
to
break
the
sombre
monotony
but
bordering
the
road
to
the
westward
the
surface
roughened
and
raised
clambering
up
to
the
higher
ground
on
the
crest
of
which
the
old
mission
and
its
surrounding
pear
trees
were
now
plainly
visible
just
beyond
the
mission
the
road
bent
abruptly
eastward
striking
off
across
the
seed
ranch
but
presley
left
the
road
at
this
point
going
on
across
the
open
fields
there
was
no
longer
any
trail
it
was
toward
three
the
sun
still
spun
a
silent
blazing
disc
high
in
the
heavens
and
tramping
through
the
clods
of
uneven
broken
plough
was
fatiguing
work
the
slope
of
the
lowest
foothills
begun
the
surface
of
the
country
became
rolling
and
suddenly
as
he
topped
a
higher
ridge
presley
came
upon
the
sheep
already
he
had
passed
the
larger
part
of
the
herd
an
intervening
rise
of
ground
having
hidden
it
from
sight
now
as
he
turned
half
way
about
looking
down
into
the
shallow
hollow
between
him
and
the
curve
of
the
creek
he
saw
them
very
plainly
the
fringe
of
the
herd
was
some
two
hundred
yards
distant
but
its
farther
side
in
that
illusive
shimmer
of
hot
surface
air
seemed
miles
away
the
sheep
were
spread
out
roughly
in
the
shape
of
a
figure
eight
two
larger
herds
connected
by
a
smaller
and
were
headed
to
the
southward
moving
slowly
grazing
on
the
wheat
stubble
as
they
proceeded
but
the
number
seemed
incalculable
hundreds
upon
hundreds
upon
hundreds
of
grey
rounded
backs
all
exactly
alike
huddled
alive
hid
the
earth
from
sight
it
was
no
longer
an
aggregate
of
individuals
it
was
a
mass
a
compact
solid
slowly
moving
mass
huge
without
form
like
a
growth
of
mushrooms
spreading
out
in
all
directions
over
the
earth
from
it
there
arose
a
vague
murmur
confused
inarticulate
like
the
sound
of
very
distant
surf
while
all
the
air
in
the
vicinity
was
heavy
with
the
warm
ammoniacal
odour
of
the
thousands
of
crowding
bodies
all
the
colours
of
the
scene
were
sombre
the
brown
of
the
earth
the
faded
yellow
of
the
dead
stubble
the
grey
of
the
myriad
of
undulating
backs
only
on
the
far
side
of
the
herd
erect
motionless
a
single
note
of
black
a
speck
a
dot
the
shepherd
stood
leaning
upon
an
empty
solitary
grave
impressive
for
a
few
moments
presley
stood
watching
then
as
he
started
to
move
on
a
curious
thing
occurred
at
first
he
thought
he
had
heard
some
one
call
his
name
he
paused
listening
there
was
no
sound
but
the
vague
noise
of
the
moving
sheep
then
as
this
first
impression
passed
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
been
beckoned
to
yet
nothing
stirred
except
for
the
lonely
figure
beyond
the
herd
there
was
no
one
in
sight
he
started
on
again
and
in
half
a
dozen
steps
found
himself
looking
over
his
shoulder
without
knowing
why
he
looked
toward
the
shepherd
then
halted
and
looked
a
second
time
and
a
third
had
the
shepherd
called
to
him
presley
knew
that
he
had
heard
no
voice
brusquely
all
his
attention
seemed
riveted
upon
this
distant
figure
he
put
one
forearm
over
his
eyes
to
keep
off
the
sun
gazing
across
the
intervening
herd
surely
the
shepherd
had
called
him
but
at
the
next
instant
he
started
uttering
an
exclamation
under
his
breath
the
speck
of
black
became
animated
presley
remarked
a
sweeping
gesture
though
the
man
had
not
beckoned
to
him
before
there
was
no
doubt
that
he
was
beckoning
now
without
any
hesitation
and
singularly
interested
in
the
incident
presley
turned
sharply
aside
and
hurried
on
toward
the
shepherd
skirting
the
herd
wondering
all
the
time
that
he
should
answer
the
call
with
so
little
question
so
little
hesitation
but
the
shepherd
came
forward
to
meet
presley
followed
by
one
of
his
dogs
as
the
two
men
approached
each
other
presley
closely
studying
the
other
began
to
wonder
where
he
had
seen
him
before
it
must
have
been
a
very
long
time
ago
upon
one
of
his
previous
visits
to
the
ranch
certainly
however
there
was
something
familiar
in
the
shepherd
face
and
figure
when
they
came
closer
to
each
other
and
presley
could
see
him
more
distinctly
this
sense
of
a
previous
acquaintance
was
increased
and
sharpened
the
shepherd
was
a
man
of
about
he
was
very
lean
and
spare
his
brown
canvas
overalls
were
thrust
into
laced
boots
a
cartridge
belt
without
any
cartridges
encircled
his
waist
a
grey
flannel
shirt
open
at
the
throat
showed
his
breast
tanned
and
ruddy
he
wore
no
hat
his
hair
was
very
black
and
rather
long
a
pointed
beard
covered
his
chin
growing
straight
and
fine
from
the
hollow
cheeks
the
absence
of
any
covering
for
his
head
was
no
doubt
habitual
with
him
for
his
face
was
as
brown
as
an
indian
a
ruddy
brown
quite
different
from
dark
olive
to
presley
morbidly
keen
observation
the
general
impression
of
the
shepherd
face
was
intensely
interesting
it
was
uncommon
to
an
astonishing
degree
presley
vivid
imagination
chose
to
see
in
it
the
face
of
an
ascetic
of
a
recluse
almost
that
of
a
young
seer
so
must
have
appeared
the
shepherds
of
the
hebraic
legends
the
younger
prophets
of
israel
dwellers
in
the
wilderness
beholders
of
visions
having
their
existence
in
a
continual
dream
talkers
with
god
gifted
with
strange
powers
suddenly
at
some
twenty
paces
distant
from
the
approaching
shepherd
presley
stopped
short
his
eyes
riveted
upon
the
other
vanamee
he
exclaimed
the
shepherd
smiled
and
came
forward
holding
out
his
hands
saying
i
thought
it
was
you
when
i
saw
you
come
over
the
hill
i
called
but
not
with
your
voice
returned
presley
i
knew
that
some
one
wanted
me
i
felt
it
i
should
have
remembered
that
you
could
do
that
kind
of
i
have
never
known
it
to
fail
it
helps
with
the
with
the
sheep
in
a
way
i
ca
tell
exactly
how
we
do
understand
these
things
yet
there
are
times
when
if
i
close
my
eyes
and
dig
my
fists
into
my
temples
i
can
hold
the
entire
herd
for
perhaps
a
minute
perhaps
though
it
imagination
who
knows
but
it
good
to
see
you
again
how
long
has
it
been
since
the
last
time
two
three
nearly
five
it
was
more
than
that
it
was
six
years
since
presley
and
vanamee
had
met
and
then
it
had
been
for
a
short
time
only
during
one
of
the
shepherd
periodical
brief
returns
to
that
part
of
the
country
during
a
week
he
and
presley
had
been
much
together
for
the
two
were
devoted
friends
then
as
abruptly
as
mysteriously
as
he
had
come
vanamee
disappeared
presley
awoke
one
morning
to
find
him
gone
thus
it
had
been
with
vanamee
for
a
period
of
sixteen
years
he
lived
his
life
in
the
unknown
one
could
not
tell
where
in
the
desert
in
the
mountains
throughout
all
the
vast
and
vague
solitary
strange
three
four
five
years
passed
the
shepherd
would
be
almost
forgotten
never
the
most
trivial
scrap
of
information
as
to
his
whereabouts
reached
los
muertos
he
had
melted
off
into
the
of
the
desert
into
the
mirage
he
sank
below
the
horizons
he
was
swallowed
up
in
the
waste
of
sand
and
sage
then
without
warning
he
would
reappear
coming
in
from
the
wilderness
emerging
from
the
unknown
no
one
knew
him
well
in
all
that
countryside
he
had
but
three
friends
presley
magnus
derrick
and
the
priest
at
the
mission
of
san
juan
de
guadalajara
father
sarria
he
remained
always
a
mystery
living
a
life
in
all
those
years
he
did
not
seem
to
have
grown
older
by
a
single
day
at
this
time
presley
knew
him
to
be
years
of
age
but
since
the
first
day
the
two
had
met
the
shepherd
face
and
bearing
had
to
his
eyes
remained
the
same
at
this
moment
presley
was
looking
into
the
same
face
he
had
first
seen
many
many
years
ago
it
was
a
face
stamped
with
an
unspeakable
sadness
a
deathless
grief
the
permanent
imprint
of
a
tragedy
long
past
but
yet
a
living
issue
presley
told
himself
that
it
was
impossible
to
look
long
into
vanamee
eyes
without
knowing
that
here
was
a
man
whose
whole
being
had
been
at
one
time
shattered
and
riven
to
its
lowest
depths
whose
life
had
suddenly
stopped
at
a
certain
moment
of
its
development
the
two
friends
sat
down
upon
the
ledge
of
the
their
eyes
wandering
incessantly
toward
the
slow
moving
herd
grazing
on
the
wheat
stubble
moving
southward
as
they
grazed
where
have
you
come
from
this
time
presley
had
asked
where
have
you
kept
yourself
the
other
swept
the
horizon
to
the
south
and
east
with
a
vague
gesture
off
there
down
to
the
south
very
far
off
so
many
places
that
i
remember
i
went
the
long
trail
this
time
a
long
long
ways
arizona
the
mexicos
and
then
afterwards
utah
and
nevada
following
the
horizon
travelling
at
hazard
into
arizona
first
going
in
by
monument
pass
and
then
on
to
the
south
through
the
country
of
the
navajos
down
by
the
aga
thia
needle
a
great
blade
of
red
rock
jutting
from
out
the
desert
like
a
knife
thrust
then
on
and
on
through
the
mexicos
all
through
the
southwest
then
back
again
in
a
great
circle
by
chihuahua
and
aldama
to
laredo
to
torreon
and
albuquerque
from
there
across
the
uncompahgre
plateau
into
the
uintah
country
then
at
last
due
west
through
nevada
to
california
and
to
the
valley
of
the
san
his
voice
lapsed
to
a
monotone
his
eyes
becoming
fixed
he
continued
to
speak
as
though
half
awake
his
thoughts
elsewhere
seeing
again
in
the
eye
of
his
mind
the
reach
of
desert
and
red
hill
the
purple
mountain
the
level
stretch
of
alkali
leper
white
all
the
savage
gorgeous
desolation
of
the
long
trail
he
ignored
presley
for
the
moment
but
on
the
other
hand
presley
himself
gave
him
but
half
his
attention
the
return
of
vanamee
had
stimulated
the
poet
memory
he
recalled
the
incidents
of
life
reviewing
again
that
terrible
drama
which
had
uprooted
his
soul
which
had
driven
him
forth
a
wanderer
a
shunner
of
men
a
sojourner
in
waste
places
he
was
strangely
enough
a
college
graduate
and
a
man
of
wide
reading
and
great
intelligence
but
he
had
chosen
to
lead
his
own
life
which
was
that
of
a
recluse
of
a
temperament
similar
in
many
ways
to
presley
there
were
capabilities
in
vanamee
that
were
not
ordinarily
to
be
found
in
the
rank
and
file
of
men
living
close
to
nature
a
poet
by
instinct
where
presley
was
but
a
poet
by
training
there
developed
in
him
a
great
sensitiveness
to
beauty
and
an
almost
abnormal
capacity
for
great
happiness
and
great
sorrow
he
felt
things
intensely
deeply
he
never
forgot
it
was
when
he
was
eighteen
or
nineteen
at
the
formative
and
most
impressionable
period
of
his
life
that
he
had
met
angele
varian
presley
barely
remembered
her
as
a
girl
of
sixteen
beautiful
almost
beyond
expression
who
lived
with
an
aged
aunt
on
the
seed
ranch
back
of
the
mission
at
this
moment
he
was
trying
to
recall
how
she
looked
with
her
hair
of
gold
hanging
in
two
straight
plaits
on
either
side
of
her
face
making
her
round
white
forehead
her
wonderful
eyes
violet
blue
heavy
lidded
with
their
astonishing
upward
slant
toward
the
temples
the
slant
that
gave
a
strange
oriental
cast
to
her
face
perplexing
enchanting
he
remembered
the
egyptian
fulness
of
the
lips
the
strange
balancing
movement
of
her
head
upon
her
slender
neck
the
same
movement
that
one
sees
in
a
snake
at
poise
never
had
he
seen
a
girl
more
radiantly
beautiful
never
a
beauty
so
strange
so
troublous
so
out
of
all
accepted
standards
it
was
small
wonder
that
vanamee
had
loved
her
and
less
wonder
still
that
his
love
had
been
so
intense
so
passionate
so
part
of
himself
angele
had
loved
him
with
a
love
no
less
than
his
own
it
was
one
of
those
legendary
passions
that
sometimes
occur
idyllic
untouched
by
civilisation
spontaneous
as
the
growth
of
trees
natural
as
strong
as
the
mountains
at
the
time
of
his
meeting
with
angele
vanamee
was
living
on
the
los
muertos
ranch
it
was
there
he
had
chosen
to
spend
one
of
his
college
vacations
but
he
preferred
to
pass
it
in
work
sometimes
herding
cattle
sometimes
pitching
hay
sometimes
working
with
pick
and
on
the
ditches
in
the
fourth
division
of
the
ranch
riding
the
range
mending
breaks
in
the
wire
fences
making
himself
generally
useful
college
bred
though
he
was
the
life
pleased
him
he
was
as
he
desired
close
to
nature
living
the
full
measure
of
life
a
worker
among
workers
taking
enjoyment
in
simple
pleasures
healthy
in
mind
and
body
he
believed
in
an
existence
passed
in
this
fashion
in
the
country
working
hard
eating
full
drinking
deep
sleeping
dreamlessly
but
every
night
after
supper
he
saddled
his
pony
and
rode
over
to
the
garden
of
the
old
mission
the
dividing
wall
on
that
side
which
once
had
separated
the
mission
garden
and
the
seed
ranch
had
long
since
crumbled
away
and
the
boundary
between
the
two
pieces
of
ground
was
marked
only
by
a
line
of
venerable
pear
trees
here
under
these
trees
he
found
angele
awaiting
him
and
there
the
two
would
sit
through
the
hot
still
evening
their
arms
about
each
other
watching
the
moon
rise
over
the
foothills
listening
to
the
trickle
of
the
water
in
the
fountain
in
the
garden
and
the
steady
croak
of
the
great
frogs
that
lived
in
the
damp
north
corner
of
the
enclosure
through
all
one
summer
the
enchantment
of
that
wonderful
love
pure
and
untainted
filled
the
lives
of
each
of
them
with
its
sweetness
the
summer
passed
the
harvest
moon
came
and
went
the
nights
were
very
dark
in
the
deep
shade
of
the
pear
trees
they
could
no
longer
see
each
other
when
they
met
at
the
rendezvous
vanamee
found
her
only
with
his
groping
hands
they
did
not
speak
mere
words
were
useless
between
them
silently
as
his
reaching
hands
touched
her
warm
body
he
took
her
in
his
arms
searching
for
her
lips
with
his
then
one
night
the
tragedy
had
suddenly
leaped
from
out
the
shadow
with
the
abruptness
of
an
explosion
it
was
impossible
afterwards
to
reconstruct
the
manner
of
its
occurrence
to
angele
mind
what
there
was
left
of
it
the
matter
always
remained
a
hideous
blur
a
blot
a
vague
terrible
confusion
no
doubt
they
two
had
been
watched
the
plan
succeeded
too
well
for
any
other
supposition
one
moonless
night
angele
arriving
under
the
black
shadow
of
the
pear
trees
a
little
earlier
than
usual
found
the
apparently
familiar
figure
waiting
for
her
all
unsuspecting
she
gave
herself
to
the
embrace
of
a
strange
pair
of
arms
and
vanamee
arriving
but
a
score
of
moments
later
stumbled
over
her
prostrate
body
inert
and
unconscious
in
the
shadow
of
the
overspiring
trees
who
was
the
other
angele
was
carried
to
her
home
on
the
seed
ranch
delirious
all
but
raving
and
vanamee
with
knife
and
revolver
ready
ranged
the
like
a
wolf
he
was
not
alone
the
whole
county
rose
raging
posse
after
posse
was
formed
sent
out
and
returned
without
so
much
as
a
clue
upon
no
one
could
even
the
shadow
of
suspicion
be
thrown
the
other
had
withdrawn
into
an
impenetrable
mystery
there
he
remained
he
never
was
found
he
never
was
so
much
as
heard
of
a
legend
arose
about
him
this
prowler
of
the
night
this
strange
fearful
figure
with
an
unseen
face
swooping
in
there
from
out
the
darkness
come
and
gone
in
an
instant
but
leaving
behind
him
a
track
of
terror
and
death
and
rage
and
undying
grief
within
the
year
in
giving
birth
to
the
child
angele
had
died
the
little
babe
was
taken
by
angele
parents
and
angele
was
buried
in
the
mission
garden
near
to
the
aged
grey
sun
dial
vanamee
stood
by
during
the
ceremony
but
half
conscious
of
what
was
going
forward
at
the
last
moment
he
had
stepped
forward
looked
long
into
the
dead
face
framed
in
its
plaits
of
gold
hair
the
hair
that
made
the
round
white
forehead
looked
again
at
the
closed
eyes
with
their
perplexing
upward
slant
toward
the
temples
oriental
bizarre
at
the
lips
with
their
egyptian
fulness
at
the
sweet
slender
neck
the
long
slim
hands
then
abruptly
turned
about
the
last
clods
were
filling
the
grave
at
a
time
when
he
was
already
far
away
his
horse
head
turned
toward
the
desert
for
two
years
no
syllable
was
heard
of
him
it
was
believed
that
he
had
killed
himself
but
vanamee
had
no
thought
of
that
for
two
years
he
wandered
through
arizona
living
in
the
desert
in
the
wilderness
a
recluse
a
nomad
an
ascetic
but
doubtless
all
his
heart
was
in
the
little
coffin
in
the
mission
garden
once
in
so
often
he
must
come
back
thither
one
day
he
was
seen
again
in
the
san
joaquin
the
priest
father
sarria
returning
from
a
visit
to
the
sick
at
bonneville
met
him
on
the
upper
road
eighteen
years
had
passed
since
angele
had
died
but
the
thread
of
vanamee
life
had
been
snapped
nothing
remained
now
but
the
tangled
ends
he
had
never
forgotten
the
long
dull
ache
the
poignant
grief
had
now
become
a
part
of
him
presley
knew
this
to
be
so
while
presley
had
been
reflecting
upon
all
this
vanamee
had
continued
to
speak
presley
however
had
not
been
wholly
inattentive
while
his
memory
was
busy
reconstructing
the
details
of
the
drama
of
the
shepherd
life
another
part
of
his
brain
had
been
swiftly
registering
picture
after
picture
that
vanamee
monotonous
flow
of
words
struck
off
as
it
were
upon
a
steadily
moving
scroll
the
music
of
the
unfamiliar
names
that
occurred
in
his
recital
was
a
stimulant
to
the
poet
imagination
presley
had
the
poet
passion
for
expressive
sonorous
names
as
these
came
and
went
in
vanamee
monotonous
undertones
like
little
notes
of
harmony
in
a
musical
progression
he
listened
delighted
with
their
navajo
quijotoa
uintah
sonora
laredo
uncompahgre
to
him
they
were
so
many
symbols
it
was
his
west
that
passed
unrolling
there
before
the
eye
of
his
mind
the
open
round
of
desert
the
mesa
like
a
vast
altar
shimmering
purple
in
the
royal
sunset
the
still
gigantic
mountains
heaving
into
the
sky
from
out
the
canyons
the
strenuous
fierce
life
of
isolated
towns
lost
and
forgotten
down
there
far
off
below
the
horizon
abruptly
his
great
poem
his
song
of
the
west
leaped
up
again
in
his
imagination
for
the
moment
he
all
but
held
it
it
was
there
close
at
hand
in
another
instant
he
would
grasp
it
yes
yes
he
exclaimed
i
can
see
it
all
the
desert
the
mountains
all
wild
primordial
untamed
how
i
should
have
loved
to
have
been
with
you
then
perhaps
i
should
have
got
hold
of
my
your
idea
the
great
poem
of
the
west
it
that
which
i
want
to
write
oh
to
put
it
all
into
hexameters
strike
the
great
iron
note
sing
the
vast
terrible
song
the
song
of
the
people
the
forerunners
of
empire
vanamee
understood
him
perfectly
he
nodded
gravely
yes
it
is
there
it
is
life
the
primitive
simple
direct
life
passionate
tumultuous
yes
there
is
an
epic
presley
caught
at
the
word
it
had
never
before
occurred
to
him
epic
yes
that
it
it
is
the
epic
i
searching
for
and
how
i
search
for
it
you
do
know
it
is
sometimes
almost
an
agony
often
and
often
i
can
feel
it
right
there
there
at
my
but
i
never
quite
catch
it
it
always
eludes
me
i
was
born
too
late
ah
to
get
back
to
that
first
view
of
things
to
see
as
homer
saw
as
beowulf
saw
as
the
nibelungen
poets
saw
the
life
is
here
the
same
as
then
the
poem
is
here
my
west
is
here
the
primeval
epic
life
is
here
here
under
our
hands
in
the
desert
in
the
mountain
on
the
ranch
all
over
here
from
winnipeg
to
guadalupe
it
is
the
man
who
is
lacking
the
poet
we
have
been
educated
away
from
it
all
we
are
out
of
touch
we
are
out
of
vanamee
heard
him
to
the
end
his
grave
sad
face
thoughtful
and
attentive
then
he
rose
i
am
going
over
to
the
mission
he
said
to
see
father
sarria
i
have
not
seen
him
how
about
the
sheep
the
dogs
will
keep
them
in
hand
and
i
shall
not
be
gone
long
besides
that
i
have
a
boy
here
to
help
he
is
over
yonder
on
the
other
side
of
the
herd
we
ca
see
him
from
presley
wondered
at
the
heedlessness
of
leaving
the
sheep
so
slightly
guarded
but
made
no
comment
and
the
two
started
off
across
the
field
in
the
direction
of
the
mission
church
well
yes
it
is
there
your
epic
observed
vanamee
as
they
went
along
but
why
write
why
not
live
in
it
steep
oneself
in
the
heat
of
the
desert
the
glory
of
the
sunset
the
blue
haze
of
the
mesa
and
the
as
you
have
done
for
instance
vanamee
nodded
no
i
could
not
do
that
declared
presley
i
want
to
go
back
but
not
so
far
as
you
i
feel
that
i
must
compromise
i
must
find
expression
i
could
not
lose
myself
like
that
in
your
desert
when
its
vastness
overwhelmed
me
or
its
beauty
dazzled
me
or
its
loneliness
weighed
down
upon
me
i
should
have
to
record
my
impressions
otherwise
i
should
each
to
his
own
life
observed
vanamee
the
mission
of
san
juan
built
of
brown
blocks
covered
with
yellow
plaster
that
at
many
points
had
dropped
away
from
the
walls
stood
on
the
crest
of
a
low
rise
of
the
ground
facing
to
the
south
a
covered
colonnade
paved
with
round
worn
bricks
from
whence
opened
the
doors
of
the
abandoned
cells
once
used
by
the
monks
adjoined
it
on
the
left
the
roof
was
of
tiled
split
longitudinally
and
laid
in
alternate
rows
now
concave
now
convex
the
main
body
of
the
church
itself
was
at
right
angles
to
the
colonnade
and
at
the
point
of
intersection
rose
the
belfry
tower
an
ancient
campanile
where
swung
the
three
cracked
bells
the
gift
of
the
king
of
spain
beyond
the
church
was
the
mission
garden
and
the
graveyard
that
overlooked
the
seed
ranch
in
a
little
hollow
beyond
presley
and
vanamee
went
down
the
long
colonnade
to
the
last
door
next
the
belfry
tower
and
vanamee
pulled
the
leather
thong
that
hung
from
a
hole
in
the
door
setting
a
little
bell
jangling
somewhere
in
the
interior
the
place
but
for
this
noise
was
shrouded
in
a
sunday
stillness
an
absolute
repose
only
at
intervals
one
heard
the
trickle
of
the
unseen
fountain
and
the
liquid
cooing
of
doves
in
the
garden
father
sarria
opened
the
door
he
was
a
small
man
somewhat
stout
with
a
smooth
and
shiny
face
he
wore
a
frock
coat
that
was
rather
dirty
slippers
and
an
old
yachting
cap
of
blue
cloth
with
a
broken
leather
vizor
he
was
smoking
a
cheap
cigar
very
fat
and
black
but
instantly
he
recognised
vanamee
his
face
went
all
alight
with
pleasure
and
astonishment
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
never
have
finished
shaking
both
his
hands
and
as
it
was
he
released
but
one
of
them
patting
him
affectionately
on
the
shoulder
with
the
other
he
was
voluble
in
his
welcome
talking
partly
in
spanish
partly
in
english
so
he
had
come
back
again
this
great
fellow
tanned
as
an
indian
lean
as
an
indian
with
an
indian
long
black
hair
but
he
had
not
changed
not
in
the
very
least
his
beard
had
not
grown
an
inch
aha
the
rascal
never
to
give
warning
to
drop
down
as
it
were
from
out
the
sky
such
a
hermit
to
live
in
the
desert
a
veritable
saint
jerome
did
a
lion
feed
him
down
there
in
arizona
or
was
it
a
raven
like
elijah
the
good
god
had
not
fattened
him
at
any
rate
and
apropos
he
was
just
about
to
dine
himself
he
had
made
a
salad
from
his
own
lettuce
the
two
would
dine
with
him
eh
for
this
my
son
that
was
lost
is
found
again
but
presley
excused
himself
instinctively
he
felt
that
sarria
and
vanamee
wanted
to
talk
of
things
concerning
which
he
was
an
outsider
it
was
not
at
all
unlikely
that
vanamee
would
spend
half
the
night
before
the
high
altar
in
the
church
he
took
himself
away
his
mind
still
busy
with
vanamee
extraordinary
life
and
character
but
as
he
descended
the
hill
he
was
startled
by
a
prolonged
and
raucous
cry
discordant
very
harsh
thrice
repeated
at
exact
intervals
and
looking
up
he
saw
one
of
father
sarria
peacocks
balancing
himself
upon
the
topmost
wire
of
the
fence
his
long
tail
trailing
his
neck
outstretched
filling
the
air
with
his
stupid
outcry
for
no
reason
than
the
desire
to
make
a
noise
about
an
hour
later
toward
four
in
the
afternoon
presley
reached
the
spring
at
the
head
of
the
little
canyon
in
the
northeast
corner
of
the
quien
sabe
ranch
the
point
toward
which
he
had
been
travelling
since
early
in
the
forenoon
the
place
was
not
without
its
charm
innumerable
overhung
the
canyon
and
broderson
creek
there
a
mere
rivulet
running
down
from
the
spring
gave
a
certain
coolness
to
the
air
it
was
one
of
the
few
spots
thereabouts
that
had
survived
the
dry
season
of
the
last
year
nearly
all
the
other
springs
had
dried
completely
while
mission
creek
on
derrick
ranch
was
nothing
better
than
a
dusty
cutting
in
the
ground
filled
with
brittle
concave
flakes
of
dried
and
mud
presley
climbed
to
the
summit
of
one
of
the
hills
the
highest
that
rose
out
of
the
canyon
from
the
crest
of
which
he
could
see
for
thirty
fifty
sixty
miles
down
the
valley
and
filling
his
pipe
smoked
lazily
for
upwards
of
an
hour
his
head
empty
of
thought
allowing
himself
to
succumb
to
a
pleasant
gentle
inanition
a
little
drowsy
comfortable
in
his
place
prone
upon
the
ground
warmed
just
enough
by
such
sunlight
as
filtered
through
the
soothed
by
the
good
tobacco
and
the
prolonged
murmur
of
the
spring
and
creek
by
degrees
the
sense
of
his
own
personality
became
blunted
the
little
wheels
and
cogs
of
thought
moved
slower
and
slower
consciousness
dwindled
to
a
point
the
animal
in
him
stretched
itself
purring
a
delightful
numbness
invaded
his
mind
and
his
body
he
was
not
asleep
he
was
not
awake
stupefied
merely
lapsing
back
to
the
state
of
the
faun
the
satyr
after
a
while
rousing
himself
a
little
he
shifted
his
position
and
drawing
from
the
pocket
of
his
shooting
coat
his
little
edition
of
the
odyssey
read
far
into
the
book
where
after
the
failure
of
all
the
suitors
to
bend
ulysses
bow
it
is
finally
put
with
mockery
into
his
own
hands
abruptly
the
drama
of
the
story
roused
him
from
all
his
languor
in
an
instant
he
was
the
poet
again
his
nerves
tingling
alive
to
every
sensation
responsive
to
every
impression
the
desire
of
creation
of
composition
grew
big
within
him
hexameters
of
his
own
clamoured
tumultuous
in
his
brain
not
for
a
long
time
had
he
felt
his
poem
as
he
called
this
sensation
so
poignantly
for
an
instant
he
told
himself
that
he
actually
held
it
it
was
no
doubt
vanamee
talk
that
had
stimulated
him
to
this
point
the
story
of
the
long
trail
with
its
desert
and
mountain
its
its
aztec
ruins
its
colour
movement
and
romance
filled
his
mind
with
picture
after
picture
the
epic
defiled
before
his
vision
like
a
pageant
once
more
he
shot
a
glance
about
him
as
if
in
search
of
the
inspiration
and
this
time
he
all
but
found
it
he
rose
to
his
feet
looking
out
and
off
below
him
as
from
a
pinnacle
presley
from
where
he
now
stood
dominated
the
entire
country
the
sun
had
begun
to
set
everything
in
the
range
of
his
vision
was
overlaid
with
a
sheen
of
gold
first
close
at
hand
it
was
the
seed
ranch
carpeting
the
little
hollow
behind
the
mission
with
a
spread
of
greens
some
dark
some
vivid
some
pale
almost
to
yellowness
beyond
that
was
the
mission
itself
its
venerable
campanile
in
whose
arches
hung
the
spanish
king
bells
already
glowing
ruddy
in
the
sunset
farther
on
he
could
make
out
annixter
ranch
house
marked
by
the
tower
of
the
artesian
well
and
a
little
farther
to
the
east
the
huddled
tiled
roofs
of
guadalajara
far
to
the
west
and
north
he
saw
bonneville
very
plain
and
the
dome
of
the
courthouse
a
purple
silhouette
against
the
glare
of
the
sky
other
points
detached
themselves
swimming
in
a
golden
mist
projecting
blue
shadows
far
before
them
the
mammoth
by
hooven
towering
superb
and
magnificent
the
line
of
eucalyptus
trees
behind
which
he
knew
was
the
los
muertos
ranch
house
his
home
the
the
great
tower
of
wood
that
stood
at
the
joining
of
the
lower
road
and
the
county
road
the
long
of
poplar
trees
and
the
white
walls
of
caraher
saloon
on
the
county
road
but
all
this
seemed
to
be

stretching
out
there
under
the
sheen
of
the

forever
and
forever
flat
vast
unbroken
a
huge
scroll
unrolling
between
the
horizons
spread
the
great
stretches
of
the
ranch
of
los

bare
of
crops
shaved
close
in
the
recent
harvest
near
at
hand
were
hills
but
on
that
far
southern
horizon
only
the
curve
of
the
great
earth
itself
checked
the
view
adjoining
los

and
widening
to
the

opened
the
broderson
ranch
the
osterman
ranch
to
the
northwest
carried
on
the
great
sweep
of
landscape
ranch
after
ranch
then
as
the
imagination
itself
expanded
under
the
stimulus
of
that
measureless
range
of
vision
even
those
great
ranches
resolved
themselves
into

mere
accessories
irrelevant

beyond
the
fine
line
of
the
horizons
over
the
curve
of
the

the
shoulder
of

were
other
ranches
equally
vast
and
beyond
these
others
and
beyond

still
others
the
immensities
multiplying
lengthening
out
vaster
and
vaster
the
whole
gigantic
sweep
of
the

expanded
titanic
before
the

the

with
heat
quivering
and
shimmering
under

at

a
faint
breath

out

passed
slowly
over
the

the
baked
and
empty
earth
accentuating
the
silence
marking
off
the
stillness
it
seemed
to
exhale
from
the
land
itself
a
prolonged
sigh
as
of
deep
fatigue
it
was
the
season
after
the
harvest
and
the
great
earth
the
mother
after
its
period
of
reproduction
its
pains
of

delivered
of
the
fruit
of
its
loins
slept
the
sleep

the

of
the

the

the
feeder
of
an

there
it
was
his

his
inspiration
his
west
his
thundering
progression
of
hexameters
a
sudden
uplift
a
sense
of
exhilaration
of
physical
exaltation
appeared
abruptly
to
sweep
presley
from
his
feet
as
from
a
point
high
above
the
world
he
seemed
to
dominate
a
universe
a
whole
order
of
things
he
was
dizzied
stunned
stupefied
his
morbid
supersensitive
mind
reeling
drunk
with
the
intoxication
of
mere
immensity
stupendous
ideas
for
which
there
were
no
names
drove
headlong
through
his
brain
terrible
formless
shapes
vague
figures
gigantic
monstrous
distorted
whirled
at
a
gallop
through
his
imagination
he
started
homeward
still
in
his
dream
descending
from
the
hill
emerging
from
the
canyon
and
took
the
short
cut
straight
across
the
quien

ranch
leaving
guadalajara
far
to
his
left
he
tramped
steadily
on
through
the
wheat
stubble
walking
fast
his
head
in
a
whirl
never
had
he
so
nearly
grasped
his
inspiration
as
at
that
moment
on
the
hilltop
even
now
though
the
sunset
was
fading
though
the
wide
reach
of
valley
was
shut
from
sight
it
still
kept
him
company
now
the
details
came
thronging
back
the
component
parts
of
his
poem
the
signs
and
symbols
of
the
west
it
was
there
close
at
hand
he
had
been
in
touch
with
it
all
day
it
was
in
the
centenarian
vividly
coloured

holding
his

the

its

a

taking
their
rise
in
a
religious
rite
abruptly
as
if
in
confirmation
presley
heard
the
sound
of
a
bell
from
the
direction
of
the
mission
itself
it
was
the
de
profundis
a
note
of
the
old
world
of
the
ancient
regime
an
echo
from
the
hillsides
of
mediaeval
europe
sounding
there
in
this
new
land
unfamiliar
and
strange
at
this
time
by
now
however
it
was
dark
presley
hurried
forward
he
came
to
the
line
fence
of
the
quien
sabe
ranch
everything
was
very
still
the
stars
were
all
out
there
was
not
a
sound
other
than
the
de
profundis
still
sounding
from
very
far
away
at
long
intervals
the
great
earth
sighed
dreamily
in
its
sleep
all
about
the
feeling
of
absolute
peace
and
quiet
and
security
and
untroubled
happiness
and
content
seemed
descending
from
the
stars
like
a
benediction
the
beauty
of
his
poem
its
idyl
came
to
him
like
a
caress
that
alone
had
been
lacking
it
was
that
perhaps
which
had
left
it
hitherto
incomplete
at
last
he
was
to
grasp
his
song
in
all
its
entity
but
suddenly
there
was
an
interruption
presley
had
climbed
the
fence
at
the
limit
of
the
quien
sabe
ranch
beyond
was
los
muertos
but
between
the
two
ran
the
railroad
he
had
only
time
to
jump
back
upon
the
embankment
when
with
a
quivering
of
all
the
earth
a
locomotive
single
unattached
shot
by
him
with
a
roar
filling
the
air
with
the
reek
of
hot
oil
vomiting
smoke
and
sparks
its
enormous
eye
cyclopean
red
throwing
a
glare
far
in
advance
shooting
by
in
a
sudden
crash
of
confused
thunder
filling
the
night
with
the
terrific
clamour
of
its
iron
hoofs
abruptly
presley
remembered
this
must
be
the
crack
passenger
engine
of
which
dyke
had
told
him
the
one
delayed
by
the
accident
on
the
bakersfield
division
and
for
whose
passage
the
track
had
been
opened
all
the
way
to
fresno
before
presley
could
recover
from
the
shock
of
the
irruption
while
the
earth
was
still
vibrating
the
rails
still
humming
the
engine
was
far
away
flinging
the
echo
of
its
frantic
gallop
over
all
the
valley
for
a
brief
instant
it
roared
with
a
hollow
diapason
on
the
long
trestle
over
broderson
creek
then
plunged
into
a
cutting
farther
on
the
quivering
glare
of
its
fires
losing
itself
in
the
night
its
thunder
abruptly
diminishing
to
a
subdued
and
distant
humming
all
at
once
this
ceased
the
engine
was
gone
but
the
moment
the
noise
of
the
engine
lapsed
presley
about
to
start
forward
again
was
conscious
of
a
confusion
of
lamentable
sounds
that
rose
into
the
night
from
out
the
engine
wake
prolonged
cries
of
agony
sobbing
wails
of
infinite
pain
pitiful
the
noises
came
from
a
little
distance
he
ran
down
the
track
crossing
the
culvert
over
the
irrigating
ditch
and
at
the
head
of
the
long
reach
of
track
between
the
culvert
and
the
long
trestle
paused
abruptly
held
immovable
at
the
sight
of
the
ground
and
rails
all
about
him
in
some
way
the
herd
of
sheep
vanamee
herd
had
found
a
breach
in
the
wire
fence
by
the
right
of
way
and
had
wandered
out
upon
the
tracks
a
band
had
been
crossing
just
at
the
moment
of
the
engine
passage
the
pathos
of
it
was
beyond
expression
it
was
a
slaughter
a
massacre
of
innocents
the
iron
monster
had
charged
full
into
the
midst
merciless
inexorable
to
the
right
and
left
all
the
width
of
the
right
of
way
the
little
bodies
had
been
flung
backs
were
snapped
against
the
fence
posts
brains
knocked
out
caught
in
the
barbs
of
the
wire
wedged
in
the
bodies
hung
suspended
under
foot
it
was
terrible
the
black
blood
winking
in
the
starlight
seeped
down
into
the
clinkers
between
the
ties
with
a
prolonged
sucking
murmur
presley
turned
away
sick
at
heart
overwhelmed
with
a
quick
burst
of
irresistible
compassion
for
this
brute
agony
he
could
not
relieve
the
sweetness
was
gone
from
the
evening
the
sense
of
peace
of
security
and
placid
contentment
was
stricken
from
the
landscape
the
hideous
ruin
in
the
engine
path
drove
all
thought
of
his
poem
from
his
mind
the
inspiration
vanished
like
a
mist
the
de
profundis
had
ceased
to
ring
he
hurried
on
across
the
los
muertos
ranch
almost
running
even
putting
his
hands
over
his
ears
till
he
was
out
of
hearing
distance
of
that
all
but
human
distress
not
until
he
was
beyond
did
he
pause
looking
back
listening
the
night
had
shut
down
again
for
a
moment
the
silence
was
profound
unbroken
then
faint
and
prolonged
across
the
levels
of
the
ranch
he
heard
the
engine
whistling
for
bonneville
again
and
again
at
rapid
intervals
in
its
flying
course
it
whistled
for
road
crossings
for
sharp
curves
for
trestles
ominous
notes
hoarse
bellowing
ringing
with
the
accents
of
menace
and
defiance
and
abruptly
presley
saw
again
in
his
imagination
the
galloping
monster
the
terror
of
steel
and
steam
with
its
single
eye
cyclopean
red
shooting
from
horizon
to
horizon
but
saw
it
now
as
the
symbol
of
a
vast
power
huge
terrible
flinging
the
echo
of
its
thunder
over
all
the
reaches
of
the
valley
leaving
blood
and
destruction
in
its
path
the
leviathan
with
tentacles
of
steel
clutching
into
the
soil
the
soulless
force
the
power
the
monster
the
colossus
the
octopus
chapter

on
the
following
morning
harran
derrick
was
up
and
about
by
a
little
after
six
and
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
had
breakfast
in
the
kitchen
of
the
ranch
house
preferring
not
to
wait
until
the
chinese
cook
laid
the
table
in
the
regular
he
scented
a
hard
day
work
ahead
of
him
and
was
anxious
to
be
at
it
betimes
he
was
practically
the
manager
of
los
muertos
and
with
the
aid
of
his
foreman
and
three
division
superintendents
carried
forward
nearly
the
entire
direction
of
the
ranch
occupying
himself
with
the
details
of
his
father
plans
executing
his
orders
signing
contracts
paying
bills
and
keeping
the
books
for
the
last
three
weeks
little
had
been
done
the
crop
such
as
it
was
had
been
harvested
and
sold
and
there
had
been
a
general
relaxation
of
activity
for
upwards
of
a
month
now
however
the
fall
was
coming
on
the
dry
season
was
about
at
its
end
any
time
after
the
twentieth
of
the
month
the
first
rains
might
be
expected
softening
the
ground
putting
it
into
condition
for
the
plough
two
days
before
this
harran
had
notified
his
superintendents
on
three
and
four
to
send
in
such
grain
as
they
had
reserved
for
seed
on
two
the
wheat
had
not
even
shown
itself
above
the
ground
while
on
one
the
home
ranch
which
was
under
his
own
immediate
supervision
the
seed
had
already
been
graded
and
selected
it
was
harran
intention
to
commence
his
seed
that
day
a
delicate
and
important
process
which
prevented
rust
and
smut
appearing
in
the
crop
when
the
wheat
should
come
up
but
furthermore
he
wanted
to
find
time
to
go
to
guadalajara
to
meet
the
governor
on
the
morning
train
his
day
promised
to
be
busy
but
as
harran
was
finishing
his
last
cup
of
coffee
phelps
the
foreman
on
the
home
ranch
who
also
looked
after
the
storage
barns
where
the
seed
was
kept
presented
himself
cap
in
hand
on
the
back
porch
by
the
kitchen
door
i
thought
i
speak
to
you
about
the
seed
from
four
sir
he
said
that
has
been
brought
in
harran
nodded
i
see
about
it
you
got
all
the
you
want
have
you
phelps
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
he
added
tell
the
stableman
i
shall
want
the
team
about
nine
to
go
to
guadalajara
put
them
in
the
buggy
the
bays
you
when
the
other
had
gone
harran
drank
off
the
rest
of
his
coffee
and
rising
passed
through
the
and
across
a
hallway
with
a
glass
roof
into
the
office
just
beyond
the
office
was
the
of
the
entire
ten
thousand
acres
of
los
muertos
but
its
appearance
and
furnishings
were
not
in
the
least
suggestive
of
a
farm
it
was
divided
at
about
its
middle
by
a
wire
railing
painted
green
and
gold
and
behind
this
railing
were
the
high
desks
where
the
books
were
kept
the
safe
the
and
and
harran
typewriting
machine
a
great
map
of
los
muertos
with
every
depression
and
elevation
together
with
indications
of
the
varying
depths
of
the
clays
and
loams
in
the
soil
accurately
plotted
hung
against
the
wall
between
the
windows
while
near
at
hand
by
the
safe
was
the
telephone
but
no
doubt
the
most
significant
object
in
the
office
was
the
ticker
this
was
an
innovation
in
the
san
joaquin
an
idea
of
shrewd
young
annixter
which
harran
and
magnus
derrick
had
been
quick
to
adopt
and
after
them
broderson
and
osterman
and
many
others
of
the
wheat
growers
of
the
county
the
offices
of
the
ranches
were
thus
connected
by
wire
with
san
francisco
and
through
that
city
with
minneapolis
duluth
chicago
new
york
and
at
last
and
most
important
of
all
with
liverpool
fluctuations
in
the
price
of
the

crop
during
and
after
the
harvest
thrilled
straight
to
the
office
of
los
muertos
to
that
of
the
quien
sabe
to
osterman
and
to
broderson
during
a
flurry
in
the
chicago
wheat
pits
in
the
august
of
that
year
which
had
affected
even
the
san
francisco
market
harran
and
magnus
had
sat
up
nearly
half
of
one
night
watching
the
strip
of
white
tape
jerking
unsteadily
from
the
reel
at
such
moments
they
no
longer
felt
their
individuality
the
ranch
became
merely
the
part
of
an
enormous
whole
a
unit
in
the
vast
agglomeration
of
wheat
land
the
whole
world
round
feeling
the
effects
of
causes
thousands
of
miles
distant
a
drought
on
the
prairies
of
dakota
a
rain
on
the
plains
of

a
frost
on
the
russian
steppes
a
hot
wind
on
the
llanos
of
the
argentine
harran
crossed
over
to
the
telephone
and
rang
six
bells
the
call
for
the
division
house
on
four
it
was
the
most
distant
the
most
isolated
point
on
all
the
ranch
situated
at
its
far
southeastern
extremity
where
few
people
ever
went
close
to
the
line
fence
a
dot
a
speck
lost
in
the
immensity
of
the
open
country
by
the
road
it
was
eleven
miles
distant
from
the
office
and
by
the
trail
to
hooven
and
the
lower
road
all
of
nine
how
about
that
seed
demanded
harran
when
he
had
got
cutter
on
the
line
the
other
made
excuses
for
an
unavoidable
delay
and
was
adding
that
he
was
on
the
point
of
starting
out
when
harran
cut
in
with
you
had
better
go
the
trail
it
will
save
a
little
time
and
i
am
in
a
hurry
put
your
sacks
on
the
horses
backs
and
cutter
if
you
see
hooven
when
you
go
by
his
place
tell
him
i
want
him
and
by
the
way
take
a
look
at
the
end
of
the
irrigating
ditch
when
you
get
to
it
see
how
they
are
getting
along
there
and
if
billy
wants
anything
tell
him
we
are
expecting
those
new
scoops
down
or
next
day
and
to
get
along
with
what
he
has
until
then
how
everything
on
four
all
right
then
give
your
seed
to
phelps
when
you
get
here
if
i
am
not
about
i
am
going
to
guadalajara
to
meet
the
governor
he
coming
down
and
that
makes
me
think
we
lost
the
case
you
know
i
had
a
letter
from
the
governor
yesterday
yes
hard
luck
behrman
did
us
up
well
and
do
lose
any
time
with
that
seed
i
want
to
after
telephoning
cutter
harran
put
on
his
hat
went
over
to
the
barns
and
found
phelps
phelps
had
already
cleaned
out
the
vat
which
was
to
contain
the
solution
of
and
was
now
at
work
regrading
the
seed
against
the
wall
behind
him
ranged
the
row
of
sacks
harran
cut
the
fastenings
of
these
and
examined
the
contents
carefully
taking
handfuls
of
wheat
from
each
and
allowing
it
to
run
through
his
fingers
or
nipping
the
grains
between
his
nails
testing
their
hardness
the
seed
was
all
of
the
white
varieties
of
wheat
and
of
a
very
high
grade
the
berries
hard
and
heavy
rigid
and
swollen
with
starch
if
it
was
all
like
that
sir
hey
observed
phelps
harran
put
his
chin
in
the
air
bread
would
be
as
good
as
cake
then
he
answered
going
from
sack
to
sack
inspecting
the
contents
and
consulting
the
tags
affixed
to
the
mouths
hello
he
remarked
here
a
red
wheat
where
did
this
come
from
that
that
red
clawson
we
sowed
to
the
piece
on
four
north
the
mission
creek
just
to
see
how
it
would
do
here
we
did
get
a
very
good
we
ca
do
better
than
to
stay
by
white
sonora
and
propo
remarked
harran
we
got
our
best
results
with
that
and
european
millers
like
it
to
mix
with
the
eastern
wheats
that
have
more
gluten
than
ours
that
is
if
we
have
any
wheat
at
all
next
a
feeling
of
discouragement
for
the
moment
bore
down
heavily
upon
him
at
intervals
this
came
to
him
and
for
the
moment
it
was
overpowering
the
idea
of
was
upon
occasion
a
veritable
oppression
everything
seemed
to
combine
to
lower
the
price
of
wheat
the
extension
of
wheat
areas
always
exceeded
increase
of
population
competition
was
growing
fiercer
every
year
the
farmer
profits
were
the
object
of
attack
from
a
score
of
different
quarters
it
was
a
flock
of
vultures
descending
upon
a
common
prey
the
commission
merchant
the
elevator
combine
the
ring
the
banks
the
warehouse
men
the
labouring
man
and
above
all
the
railroad
steadily
the
liverpool
buyers
cut
and
cut
and
cut
everything
every
element
of
the
markets
tended
to
force
down
the
price
to
the
lowest
possible
figure
at
which
it
could
be
profitably
farmed
now
it
was
down
to
it
was
at
that
figure
the
crop
had
sold
that
year
and
to
think
that
the
governor
had
seen
wheat
at
two
dollars
and
five
cents
in
the
year
of
the
war
he
turned
back
to
the
house
after
giving
phelps
final
directions
gloomy
disheartened
his
hands
deep
in
his
pockets
wondering
what
was
to
be
the
outcome
so
narrow
had
the
margin
of
profit
shrunk
that
a
dry
season
meant
bankruptcy
to
the
smaller
farmers
throughout
all
the
valley
he
knew
very
well
how
widespread
had
been
the
distress
the
last
two
years
with
their
own
tenants
on
los
muertos
affairs
had
reached
the
stage
of
desperation
derrick
had
practically
been
obliged
to
carry
hooven
and
some
of
the
others
the
governor
himself
had
made
almost
nothing
during
the
last
season
a
third
year
like
the
last
with
the
price
steadily
sagging
meant
nothing
else
but
ruin
but
here
he
checked
himself
two
consecutive
dry
seasons
in
california
were
almost
unprecedented
a
third
would
be
beyond
belief
and
the
complete
rest
for
nearly
all
the
land
was
a
compensation
they
had
made
no
money
that
was
true
but
they
had
lost
none
thank
god
the
homestead
was
free
of
mortgage
one
good
season
would
more
than
make
up
the
difference
he
was
in
a
better
mood
by
the
time
he
reached
the
driveway
that
led
up
to
the
ranch
house
and
as
he
raised
his
eyes
toward
the
house
itself
he
could
not
but
feel
that
the
sight
of
his
home
was
cheering
the
ranch
house
was
set
in
a
great
grove
of
eucalyptus
oak
and
cypress
enormous
trees
growing
from
out
a
lawn
that
was
as
green
as
fresh
and
as
as
any
in
a
garden
in
the
city
this
lawn
flanked
all
one
side
of
the
house
and
it
was
on
this
side
that
the
family
elected
to
spend
most
of
its
time
the
other
side
looking
out
upon
the
home
ranch
toward
bonneville
and
the
railroad
was
but
little
used
a
deep
porch
ran
the
whole
length
of
the
house
here
and
in
the
lower
branches
of
a
near
the
steps
harran
had
built
a
little
summer
house
for
his
mother
to
the
left
of
the
ranch
house
itself
toward
the
county
road
was
the
and
kitchen
for
some
of
the
hands
from
the
steps
of
the
porch
the
view
to
the
southward
expanded
to
infinity
there
was
not
so
much
as
a
twig
to
obstruct
the
view
in
one
leap
the
eye
reached
the
fine
delicate
line
where
earth
and
sky
met
miles
away
the
flat
monotony
of
the
land
clean
of
fencing
was
broken
by
one
spot
only
the
roof
of
the
division
superintendent
house
on
three
a
mere
speck
just
darker
than
the
ground
cutter
house
on
four
was
not
even
in
sight
that
was
below
the
horizon
as
harran
came
up
he
saw
his
mother
at
breakfast
the
table
had
been
set
on
the
porch
and
derrick
stirring
her
coffee
with
one
hand
held
open
with
the
other
the
pages
of
walter
pater
at
her
feet
princess
nathalie
the
white
angora
cat
sleek
sat
on
her
haunches
industriously
licking
at
the
white
fur
of
her
breast
while
near
at
hand
by
the
railing
of
the
porch
presley
pottered
with
a
new
bicycle
lamp
filling
it
with
oil
adjusting
the
wicks
harran
kissed
his
mother
and
sat
down
in
a
wicker
chair
on
the
porch
removing
his
hat
running
his
fingers
through
his
yellow
hair
magnus
derrick
wife
looked
hardly
old
enough
to
be
the
mother
of
two
such
big
fellows
as
harran
and
lyman
derrick
she
was
not
far
into
the
fifties
and
her
brown
hair
still
retained
much
of
its
brightness
she
could
yet
be
called
pretty
her
eyes
were
large
and
easily
assumed
a
look
of
inquiry
and
innocence
such
as
one
might
expect
to
see
in
a
young
girl
by
disposition
she
was
retiring
she
easily
obliterated
herself
she
was
not
made
for
the
harshness
of
the
world
and
yet
she
had
known
these
harshnesses
in
her
younger
days
magnus
had
married
her
when
she
was
years
old
at
a
time
when
she
was
a
graduate
of
some
years
standing
from
the
state
normal
school
and
was
teaching
literature
music
and
penmanship
in
a
seminary
in
the
town
of
marysville
she
overworked
herself
here
continually
loathing
the
strain
of
teaching
yet
clinging
to
it
with
a
tenacity
born
of
the
knowledge
that
it
was
her
only
means
of
support
both
her
parents
were
dead
she
was
dependent
upon
herself
her
one
ambition
was
to
see
italy
and
the
bay
of
naples
the
marble
faun
raphael
madonnas
and
il
trovatore
were
her
beau
ideals
of
literature
and
art
she
dreamed
of
italy
rome
naples
and
the
world
great
there
was
no
doubt
that
her
affair
with
magnus
had
been
a
but
annie
payne
would
have
loved
any
man
who
would
have
taken
her
out
of
the
droning
routine
of
the
class
and
music
room
she
had
followed
his
fortunes
unquestioningly
first
at
sacramento
during
the
turmoil
of
his
political
career
later
on
at
placerville
in
el
dorado
county
after
derrick
had
interested
himself
in
the
corpus
christi
group
of
mines
and
finally
at
los
muertos
where
after
selling
out
his
fourth
interest
in
corpus
christi
he
had
turned
rancher
and
had
come
in
on
the
new
tracts
of
wheat
land
just
thrown
open
by
the
railroad
she
had
lived
here
now
for
nearly
ten
years
but
never
for
one
moment
since
the
time
her
glance
first
lost
itself
in
the
unbroken
immensity
of
the
ranches
had
she
known
a
moment
content
continually
there
came
into
her
pretty
eyes
the
eyes
of
a
young
doe
a
look
of
uneasiness
of
distrust
and
aversion
los
muertos
frightened
her
she
remembered
the
days
of
her
young
girlhood
passed
on
a
farm
in
eastern
ohio
five
hundred
acres
neatly
partitioned
into
the
water
lot
the
cow
pasture
the
corn
lot
the
barley
field
and
wheat
farm
cosey
comfortable
where
the
farmers
loved
their
land
caressing
it
coaxing
it
nourishing
it
as
though
it
were
a
thing
almost
conscious
where
the
seed
was
sown
by
hand
and
a
single
plough
was
sufficient
for
the
entire
farm
where
the
scythe
sufficed
to
cut
the
harvest
and
the
grain
was
thrashed
with
flails
but
this
new
order
of
things
a
ranch
bounded
only
by
the
horizons
where
as
far
as
one
could
see
to
the
north
to
the
east
to
the
south
and
to
the
west
was
all
one
holding
a
principality
ruled
with
iron
and
steam
bullied
into
a
yield
of
three
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
bushels
where
even
when
the
land
was
resting
unploughed
unharrowed
and
unsown
the
wheat
came
up
troubled
her
and
even
at
times
filled
her
with
an
undefinable
terror
to
her
mind
there
was
something
inordinate
about
it
all
something
almost
unnatural
the
direct
brutality
of
ten
thousand
acres
of
wheat
nothing
but
wheat
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
stunned
her
a
little
the
of
a
young
seminary
with
her
pretty
eyes
and
delicate
fingers
shrank
from
it
she
did
not
want
to
look
at
so
much
wheat
there
was
something
vaguely
indecent
in
the
sight
this
food
of
the
people
this
elemental
force
this
basic
energy
weltering
here
under
the
sun
in
all
the
unconscious
nakedness
of
a
sprawling
primordial
titan
the
monotony
of
the
ranch
ate
into
her
heart
hour
by
hour
year
by
year
and
with
it
all
when
was
she
to
see
rome
italy
and
the
bay
of
naples
it
was
a
different
prospect
truly
magnus
had
given
her
his
promise
that
once
the
ranch
was
well
established
they
two
should
travel
but
continually
he
had
been
obliged
to
put
her
off
now
for
one
reason
now
for
another
the
machine
would
not
as
yet
run
of
itself
he
must
still
feel
his
hand
upon
the
lever
next
year
perhaps
when
wheat
should
go
to
ninety
or
the
rains
were
good
she
did
not
insist
she
obliterated
herself
only
allowing
from
time
to
time
her
pretty
questioning
eyes
to
meet
his
in
the
meantime
she
retired
within
herself
she
surrounded
herself
with
books
her
taste
was
of
the
delicacy
of
point
lace
she
knew
her
austin
dobson
by
heart
she
read
poems
essays
the
ideas
of
the
seminary
at
marysville
persisting
in
her
mind
marius
the
epicurean
the
essays
of
elia
sesame
and
lilies
the
stones
of
venice
and
the
little
toy
magazines
full
of
the
flaccid
banalities
of
the
minor
poets
were
continually
in
her
hands
when
presley
had
appeared
on
los
muertos
she
had
welcomed
his
arrival
with
delight
here
at
last
was
a
congenial
spirit
she
looked
forward
to
long
conversations
with
the
young
man
on
literature
art
and
ethics
but
presley
had
disappointed
her
that
he
outside
of
his
few
chosen
deities
should
care
little
for
literature
shocked
her
beyond
words
his
indifference
to
style
to
elegant
english
was
a
positive
affront
his
savage
abuse
and
open
ridicule
of
the
neatly
phrased
rondeaux
and
sestinas
and
chansonettes
of
the
little
magazines
was
to
her
mind
a
wanton
and
cruelty
she
found
his
homer
with
its
slaughters
and
hecatombs
and
barbaric
feastings
and
headstrong
passions
violent
and
coarse
she
could
not
see
with
him
any
romance
any
poetry
in
the
life
around
her
she
looked
to
italy
for
that
his
song
of
the
west
which
only
once
incoherent
and
fierce
he
had
tried
to
explain
to
her
its
swift
tumultous
life
its
truth
its
nobility
and
savagery
its
heroism
and
obscenity
had
revolted
her
but
presley
she
had
murmured
that
is
not
no
he
had
cried
between
his
teeth
no
thank
god
it
is
a
little
later
one
of
the
stablemen
brought
the
buggy
with
the
team
of
bays
up
to
the
steps
of
the
porch
and
harran
putting
on
a
different
coat
and
a
black
hat
took
himself
off
to
guadalajara
the
morning
was
fine
there
was
no
cloud
in
the
sky
but
as
harran
buggy
drew
away
from
the
grove
of
trees
about
the
ranch
house
emerging
into
the
open
country
on
either
side
of
the
lower
road
he
caught
himself
looking
sharply
at
the
sky
and
the
faint
line
of
hills
beyond
the
quien
sabe
ranch
there
was
a
certain
indefinite
cast
to
the
landscape
that
to
harran
eye
was
not
to
be
mistaken
rain
the
first
of
the
season
was
not
far
off
that
good
he
muttered
touching
the
bays
with
the
whip
we
get
our
ploughs
to
hand
any
too
these
ploughs
magnus
derrick
had
ordered
from
an
eastern
manufacturer
some
months
before
since
he
was
dissatisfied
with
the
results
obtained
from
the
ones
he
had
used
hitherto
which
were
of
local
make
however
there
had
been
exasperating
and
unexpected
delays
in
their
shipment
magnus
and
harran
both
had
counted
upon
having
the
ploughs
in
their
implement
barns
that
very
week
but
a
tracer
sent
after
them
had
only
resulted
in
locating
them
still
en
route
somewhere
between
the
needles
and
bakersfield
now
there
was
likelihood
of
rain
within
the
week
ploughing
could
be
undertaken
immediately
afterward
so
soon
as
the
ground
was
softened
but
there
was
a
fair
chance
that
the
ranch
would
lie
idle
for
want
of
proper
machinery
it
was
ten
minutes
before
train
time
when
harran
reached
the
depot
at
guadalajara
the
san
francisco
papers
of
the
preceding
day
had
arrived
on
an
earlier
train
he
bought
a
couple
from
the
station
agent
and
looked
them
over
till
a
distant
and
prolonged
whistle
announced
the
approach
of
the
down
train
in
one
of
the
four
passengers
that
alighted
from
the
train
he
recognised
his
father
he
half
rose
in
his
seat
whistling
shrilly
between
his
teeth
waving
his
hand
and
magnus
derrick
catching
sight
of
him
came
forward
quickly
magnus
the
governor
was
all
of
six
feet
tall
and
though
now
well
toward
his
sixtieth
year
was
as
erect
as
an
officer
of
cavalry
he
was
broad
in
proportion
a
fine
commanding
figure
imposing
an
immediate
respect
impressing
one
with
a
sense
of
gravity
of
dignity
and
a
certain
pride
of
race
he
was
with
a
broad
chin
and
a
prominent
nose
the
characteristic
of
the
family
thin
with
a
high
bridge
such
as
one
sees
in
the
later
portraits
of
the
duke
of
wellington
his
hair
was
thick
and
and
had
a
tendency
to
curl
in
a
forward
direction
just
in
front
of
his
ears
he
wore
a
of
grey
with
a
wide
brim
and
a
frock
coat
and
carried
a
cane
with
a
yellowed
ivory
head
as
a
young
man
it
had
been
his
ambition
to
represent
his
native
state
north
carolina
in
the
united
states
senate
calhoun
was
his
great
man
but
in
two
successive
campaigns
he
had
been
defeated
his
career
checked
in
this
direction
he
had
come
to
california
in
the
fifties
he
had
known
and
had
been
the
intimate
friend
of
such
men
as
terry
broderick
general
baker
lick
alvarado
emerich
larkin
and
above
all
of
the
unfortunate
and
misunderstood
ralston
once
he
had
been
put
forward
as
the
democratic
candidate
for
governor
but
failed
of
election
after
this
magnus
had
definitely
abandoned
politics
and
had
invested
all
his
money
in
the
corpus
christi
mines
then
he
had
sold
out
his
interest
at
a
small
profit
just
in
time
to
miss
his
chance
of
becoming
a
in
the
comstock
boom
and
was
looking
for
reinvestments
in
other
lines
when
the
news
that
wheat
had
been
discovered
in
california
was
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
practically
it
amounted
to
a
discovery
glenn
first
harvest
of
wheat
in
colusa
county
quietly
undertaken
but
suddenly
realised
with
dramatic
abruptness
gave
a
new
matter
for
reflection
to
the
thinking
men
of
the
new
west
california
suddenly
leaped
unheralded
into
the
world
market
as
a
competitor
in
wheat
production
in
a
few
years
her
output
of
wheat
exceeded
the
value
of
her
of
gold
and
when
later
on
the
pacific
and
southwestern
railroad
threw
open
to
settlers
the
rich
lands
of
tulare
county
conceded
to
the
corporation
by
the
government
as
a
bonus
for
the
construction
of
the
road
magnus
had
been
quick
to
seize
the
opportunity
and
had
taken
up
the
ten
thousand
acres
of
los
muertos
wherever
he
had
gone
magnus
had
taken
his
family
with
him
lyman
had
been
born
at
sacramento
during
the
turmoil
and
excitement
of
campaign
for
governor
and
harran
at
shingle
springs
in
el
dorado
county
six
years
later
but
magnus
was
in
every
sense
the
prominent
in
whatever
circle
he
moved
he
was
the
chief
figure
instinctively
other
men
looked
to
him
as
the
leader
he
himself
was
proud
of
this
distinction
he
assumed
the
grand
manner
very
easily
and
carried
it
well
as
a
public
speaker
he
was
one
of
the
last
of
the
followers
of
the
old
school
of
orators
he
even
carried
the
diction
and
manner
of
the
rostrum
into
private
life
it
was
said
of
him
that
his
most
colloquial
conversation
could
be
taken
down
in
shorthand
and
read
off
as
an
admirable
specimen
of
pure
english
he
loved
to
do
things
upon
a
grand
scale
to
preside
to
dominate
in
his
good
humour
there
was
something
jovian
when
angry
everybody
around
him
trembled
but
he
had
not
the
genius
for
detail
was
not
patient
the
certain
grandiose
lavishness
of
his
disposition
occupied
itself
more
with
results
than
with
means
he
was
always
ready
to
take
chances
to
hazard
everything
on
the
hopes
of
colossal
returns
in
the
mining
days
at
placerville
there
was
no
more
redoubtable
poker
player
in
the
county
he
had
been
as
lucky
in
his
mines
as
in
his
gambling
sinking
shafts
and
tunnelling
in
violation
of
expert
theory
and
finding
pay
in
every
case
without
knowing
it
he
allowed
himself
to
work
his
ranch
much
as
if
he
was
still
working
his
mine
the
spirit
of
unscientific
persisted
in
his
mind
everything
was
a
gamble
who
took
the
greatest
chances
was
most
apt
to
be
the
greatest
winner
the
idea
of
manuring
los
muertos
of
husbanding
his
great
resources
he
would
have
scouted
as
niggardly
hebraic
ungenerous
magnus
climbed
into
the
buggy
helping
himself
with
outstretched
hand
which
he
still
held
the
two
were
immensely
fond
of
each
other
proud
of
each
other
they
were
constantly
together
and
magnus
kept
no
secrets
from
his
favourite
son
well
well
i
am
very
pleased
you
came
yourself
harran
i
feared
that
you
might
be
too
busy
and
send
phelps
it
was
harran
was
about
to
reply
but
at
that
moment
magnus
caught
sight
of
the
three
flat
cars
loaded
with
farming
machines
which
still
remained
on
the
siding
above
the
station
he
laid
his
hands
on
the
reins
and
harran
checked
the
team
harran
observed
magnus
fixing
the
machinery
with
a
judicial
frown
harran
those
look
singularly
like
our
ploughs
drive
over
the
train
had
by
this
time
gone
on
its
way
and
harran
brought
the
team
up
to
the
siding
ah
i
was
right
said
the
governor
derrick
los
muertos
bonneville
from
ditson
rochester
these
are
ours
harran
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
at
last
he
answered
and
just
in
time
too
we
have
rain
before
the
week
is
out
i
think
now
that
i
am
here
i
will
telephone
phelps
to
send
the
wagon
right
down
for
these
i
started
magnus
nodded
a
grave
approval
that
was
shrewd
boy
as
to
the
rain
i
think
you
are
well
informed
we
will
have
an
early
season
the
ploughs
have
arrived
at
a
happy
it
means
money
to
us
governor
remarked
harran
but
as
he
turned
the
horses
to
allow
his
father
to
get
into
the
buggy
again
the
two
were
surprised
to
hear
a
thick
throaty
voice
wishing
them
and
turning
about
were
aware
of
behrman
who
had
come
up
while
they
were
examining
the
ploughs
harran
eyes
flashed
on
the
instant
and
through
his
nostrils
he
drew
a
sharp
quick
breath
while
a
certain
rigour
of
carriage
stiffened
the
set
of
magnus
shoulders
and
back
magnus
had
not
yet
got
into
the
buggy
but
stood
with
the
team
between
him
and
behrman
eyeing
him
calmly
across
the
horses
backs
behrman
came
around
to
the
other
side
of
the
buggy
and
faced
magnus
he
was
a
large
fat
man
with
a
great
stomach
his
cheek
and
the
upper
part
of
his
thick
neck
ran
together
to
form
a
great
tremulous
jowl
shaven
and
in
colour
a
roll
of
fat
sprinkled
with
sparse
hair
moist
with
perspiration
protruded
over
the
back
of
his
collar
he
wore
a
heavy
black
moustache
on
his
head
was
a
hat
of
stiff
brown
straw
highly
varnished
a
linen
vest
stamped
with
innumerable
interlocked
horseshoes
covered
his
protuberant
stomach
upon
which
a
heavy
watch
chain
of
hollow
links
rose
and
fell
with
his
difficult
breathing
clinking
against
the
vest
buttons
of
imitation
behrman
was
the
banker
of
bonneville
but
besides
this
he
was
many
other
things
he
was
a
real
estate
agent
he
bought
grain
he
dealt
in
mortgages
he
was
one
of
the
local
political
bosses
but
more
important
than
all
this
he
was
the
representative
of
the
pacific
and
southwestern
railroad
in
that
section
of
tulare
county
the
railroad
did
little
business
in
that
part
of
the
country
that
behrman
did
not
supervise
from
the
consignment
of
a
shipment
of
wheat
to
the
management
of
a
damage
suit
or
even
to
the
repair
and
maintenance
of
the
right
of
way
during
the
time
when
the
ranchers
of
the
county
were
fighting
the
case
behrman
had
been
much
in
evidence
in
and
about
the
san
francisco
court
rooms
and
the
lobby
of
the
legislature
in
sacramento
he
had
returned
to
bonneville
only
recently
a
decision
adverse
to
the
ranchers
being
foreseen
the
position
he
occupied
on
the
salary
list
of
the
pacific
and
southwestern
could
not
readily
be
defined
for
he
was
neither
freight
agent
passenger
agent
attorney
broker
nor
political
servant
though
his
influence
in
all
these
offices
was
undoubted
and
enormous
but
for
all
that
the
ranchers
about
bonneville
knew
whom
to
look
to
as
a
source
of
trouble
there
was
no
denying
the
fact
that
for
osterman
broderson
annixter
and
derrick
behrman
was
the
railroad
mr
derrick
he
cried
as
he
came
up
harran
glad
to
see
you
back
he
held
out
a
thick
hand
magnus
head
and
shoulders
above
the
other
tall
thin
erect
looked
down
upon
behrman
inclining
his
head
failing
to
see
his
extended
hand
sir
he
observed
and
waited
for
behrman
further
speech
well
derrick
continued
behrman
wiping
the
back
of
his
neck
with
his
handkerchief
i
saw
in
the
city
papers
yesterday
that
our
case
had
gone
against
i
guess
it
was
any
great
news
to
you
commented
harran
his
face
scarlet
i
guess
you
knew
which
way
ulsteen
was
going
to
jump
after
your
very
first
interview
with
him
you
do
like
to
be
surprised
in
this
sort
of
thing
now
you
know
better
than
that
harran
remonstrated
behrman
blandly
i
know
what
you
mean
to
imply
but
i
ai
going
to
let
it
make
me
get
mad
i
wanted
to
say
to
your
governor
i
wanted
to
say
to
you
derrick
as
one
man
to
another
letting
alone
for
the
minute
that
we
were
on
opposite
sides
of
the
case
that
i
sorry
you
win
your
side
made
a
good
fight
but
it
was
in
a
mistaken
cause
the
whole
trouble
why
you
could
have
figured
out
before
you
ever
went
into
the
case
that
such
rates
are
confiscation
of
property
you
must
allow
us
must
allow
the
railroad
a
fair
interest
on
the
investment
you
do
want
us
to
go
into
the
receiver
hands
do
you
now
derrick
the
board
of
railroad
commissioners
was
bought
remarked
magnus
sharply
a
keen
brisk
flash
glinting
in
his
eye
it
was
part
of
the
game
put
in
harran
for
the
railroad
commission
to
cut
rates
to
a
ridiculous
figure
far
below
a
reasonable
figure
just
so
that
it
would
be
confiscation
whether
ulsteen
is
a
tool
of
yours
or
not
he
had
to
put
the
rates
back
to
what
they
were
if
you
enforced
those
rates
harran
returned
behrman
calmly
we
would
be
able
to
earn
sufficient
money
to
meet
operating
expenses
or
fixed
charges
to
say
nothing
of
a
surplus
left
over
to
pay
dividends
tell
me
when
the
and
ever
paid
the
lowest
rates
continued
behrman
that
the
legislature
can
establish
must
be
such
as
will
secure
us
a
fair
interest
on
our
well
what
your
standard
come
let
hear
it
who
is
to
say
what
a
fair
rate
the
railroad
has
its
own
notions
of
fairness
the
laws
of
the
state
returned
behrman
fix
the
rate
of
interest
at
seven
per
cent
that
a
good
enough
standard
for
us
there
is
no
reason
harran
why
a
dollar
invested
in
a
railroad
should
not
earn
as
much
as
a
dollar
represented
by
a
promissory
note
seven
per
cent
by
applying
your
schedule
of
rates
we
would
not
earn
a
cent
we
would
be
interest
on
your
investment
cried
harran
furious
it
fine
to
talk
about
fair
interest
i
know
and
you
know
that
the
total
earnings
of
the
and
their
main
branch
and
leased
lines
for
last
year
was
between
nineteen
and
twenty
millions
of
dollars
do
you
mean
to
say
that
twenty
million
dollars
is
seven
per
cent
of
the
original
cost
of
the
road
behrman
spread
out
his
hands
smiling
that
was
the
gross
not
the
net
figure
and
how
can
you
tell
what
was
the
original
cost
of
the
road
ah
that
just
it
shouted
harran
emphasising
each
word
with
a
blow
of
his
fist
upon
his
knee
his
eyes
sparkling
you
take
cursed
good
care
that
we
do
know
anything
about
the
original
cost
of
the
road
but
we
know
you
are
bonded
for
treble
your
value
and
we
know
this
that
the
road
could
have
been
built
for
thousand
dollars
per
mile
and
that
you
say
it
cost
you
thousand
it
makes
a
difference
behrman
on
which
of
these
two
figures
you
are
basing
your
seven
per
that
all
may
show
obstinacy
harran
observed
behrman
vaguely
but
it
do
show
common
we
are
threshing
out
old
straw
i
believe
gentlemen
remarked
magnus
the
question
was
thoroughly
sifted
in
the
quite
right
assented
behrman
the
best
way
is
that
the
railroad
and
the
farmer
understand
each
other
and
get
along
peaceably
we
are
both
dependent
on
each
other
your
ploughs
i
believe
behrman
nodded
toward
the
flat
cars
they
are
consigned
to
me
admitted
magnus
it
looks
a
trifle
like
rain
observed
behrman
easing
his
neck
and
jowl
in
his
limp
collar
i
suppose
you
will
want
to
begin
ploughing
next
possibly
said
magnus
i
see
that
your
ploughs
are
hurried
through
for
you
then
derrick
we
will
route
them
by
fast
freight
for
you
and
it
wo
cost
you
anything
what
do
you
mean
demanded
harran
the
ploughs
are
here
we
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
the
railroad
i
am
going
to
have
my
wagons
down
here
this
i
am
sorry
answered
behrman
but
the
cars
are
going
north
not
as
you
thought
coming
from
the
north
they
have
not
been
to
san
francisco
magnus
made
a
slight
movement
of
the
head
as
one
who
remembers
a
fact
hitherto
forgotten
but
harran
was
as
yet
unenlightened
to
san
francisco
he
answered
we
want
them
here
what
are
you
talking
about
well
you
know
of
course
the
regulations
answered
behrman
freight
of
this
kind
coming
from
the
eastern
points
into
the
state
must
go
first
to
one
of
our
common
points
and
be
reshipped
from
harran
did
remember
now
but
never
before
had
the
matter
so
struck
home
he
leaned
back
in
his
seat
in
dumb
amazement
for
the
instant
even
magnus
had
turned
a
little
pale
then
abruptly
harran
broke
out
violent
and
raging
what
next
my
god
why
do
you
break
into
our
houses
at
night
why
do
you
steal
the
watch
out
of
my
pocket
steal
the
horses
out
of
the
harness
hold
us
up
with
a
yes
and
deliver
your
money
or
your
life
here
we
bring
our
ploughs
from
the
east
over
your
lines
but
you
not
content
with
your
rate
between
eastern
points
and
bonneville
you
want
to
get
us
under
your
ruinous
rate
between
bonneville
and
san
francisco
and
return
think
of
it
here
a
load
of
stuff
for
bonneville
that
ca
stop
at
bonneville
where
it
is
consigned
but
has
got
to
go
up
to
san
francisco
first
by
way
of
bonneville
at
forty
cents
per
ton
and
then
be
reshipped
from
san
francisco
back
to
bonneville
again
at
cents
per
ton
the
rate
and
we
have
to
pay
it
all
or
go
without
here
are
the
ploughs
right
here
in
sight
of
the
land
they
have
got
to
be
used
on
the
season
just
ready
for
them
and
we
ca
touch
them
oh
he
exclaimed
in
deep
disgust
is
it
a
pretty
mess
is
it
a
farce
the
whole
dirty
business
behrman
listened
to
him
unmoved
his
little
eyes
blinking
under
his
fat
forehead
the
gold
chain
of
hollow
links
clicking
against
the
pearl
buttons
of
his
waistcoat
as
he
breathed
it
do
do
any
good
to
let
loose
like
that
harran
he
said
at
length
i
am
willing
to
do
what
i
can
for
you
i
hurry
the
ploughs
through
but
i
ca
change
the
freight
regulation
of
the
what
your
blackmail
for
this
vociferated
harran
how
much
do
you
want
to
let
us
go
how
much
have
we
got
to
pay
you
to
be
allowed
to
use
our
own
ploughs
what
your
figure
come
spit
it
i
see
you
are
trying
to
make
me
angry
harran
returned
behrman
but
you
wo
succeed
better
give
up
trying
my
boy
as
i
said
the
best
way
is
to
have
the
railroad
and
the
farmer
get
along
amicably
it
is
the
only
way
we
can
do
business
well
governor
i
must
trot
along
he
took
himself
off
but
before
leaving
guadalajara
magnus
dropped
into
the
town
small
grocery
store
to
purchase
a
box
of
cigars
of
a
certain
mexican
brand
unprocurable
elsewhere
harran
remained
in
the
buggy
while
he
waited
dyke
appeared
at
the
end
of
the
street
and
seeing
derrick
younger
son
came
over
to
shake
hands
with
him
he
explained
his
affair
with
the
and
and
asked
the
young
man
what
he
thought
of
the
expected
rise
in
the
price
of
hops
hops
ought
to
be
a
good
thing
harran
told
him
the
crop
in
germany
and
in
new
york
has
been
a
dead
failure
for
the
last
three
years
and
so
many
people
have
gone
out
of
the
business
that
there
likely
to
be
a
shortage
and
a
stiff
advance
in
the
price
they
ought
to
go
to
a
dollar
next
year
sure
hops
ought
to
be
a
good
thing
how
the
old
lady
and
sidney
dyke
why
fairly
well
thank
you
harran
they
up
to
sacramento
just
now
to
see
my
brother
i
was
thinking
of
going
in
with
my
brother
into
this
hop
business
but
i
had
a
letter
from
him
this
morning
he
may
not
be
able
to
meet
me
on
this
proposition
he
got
other
business
on
hand
if
he
pulls
out
and
he
probably
will
i
have
to
go
it
alone
but
have
to
borrow
i
had
thought
with
his
money
and
mine
we
would
have
enough
to
pull
off
the
affair
without
mortgaging
anything
as
it
is
i
guess
i
have
to
see
i
be
cursed
if
i
would
exclaimed
harran
well
behrman
is
a
screw
admitted
the
engineer
and
he
is
to
his
boots
but
business
is
business
and
he
would
have
to
stand
by
a
contract
in
black
and
white
and
this
chance
in
hops
is
too
good
to
let
slide
i
guess
we
try
it
on
harran
i
can
get
a
good
foreman
that
knows
all
about
hops
just
now
and
if
the
deal
pays
well
i
want
to
send
sid
to
a
seminary
up
in
san
well
mortgage
the
crops
but
do
mortgage
the
homestead
dyke
said
harran
and
by
the
way
have
you
looked
up
the
freight
rates
on
hops
no
i
have
yet
answered
dyke
and
i
had
better
be
sure
of
that
had
i
i
hear
that
the
rate
is
reasonable
you
be
sure
to
have
a
clear
understanding
with
the
railroad
first
about
the
rate
harran
warned
him
when
magnus
came
out
of
the
grocery
store
and
once
more
seated
himself
in
the
buggy
he
said
to
harran
boy
drive
over
here
to
before
we
start
home
i
want
to
ask
him
to
dine
with
us
osterman
and
broderson
are
to
drop
in
i
believe
and
i
should
like
to
have
annixter
as
magnus
was
lavishly
hospitable
los
muertos
doors
invariably
stood
open
to
all
the
derricks
neighbours
and
once
in
so
often
magnus
had
a
few
of
his
intimates
to
dinner
as
harran
and
his
father
drove
along
the
road
toward
annixter
ranch
house
magnus
asked
about
what
had
happened
during
his
absence
he
inquired
after
his
wife
and
the
ranch
commenting
upon
the
work
on
the
irrigating
ditch
harran
gave
him
the
news
of
the
past
week
discharge
his
resolve
to
raise
a
crop
of
hops
vanamee
return
the
killing
of
the
sheep
and
hooven
petition
to
remain
upon
the
ranch
as
magnus
tenant
it
needed
only
harran
recommendation
that
the
german
should
remain
to
have
magnus
consent
upon
the
instant
you
know
more
about
it
than
i
boy
he
said
and
whatever
you
think
is
wise
shall
be
harran
touched
the
bays
with
the
whip
urging
them
to
their
briskest
pace
they
were
not
yet
at
annixter
and
he
was
anxious
to
get
back
to
the
ranch
house
to
supervise
the
of
his
seed
by
the
way
governor
he
demanded
suddenly
how
is
lyman
getting
on
lyman
magnus
eldest
son
had
never
taken
kindly
toward
ranch
life
he
resembled
his
mother
more
than
he
did
magnus
and
had
inherited
from
her
a
distaste
for
agriculture
and
a
tendency
toward
a
profession
at
a
time
when
harran
was
learning
the
rudiments
of
farming
lyman
was
entering
the
state
university
and
graduating
thence
had
spent
three
years
in
the
study
of
law
but
later
on
traits
that
were
particularly
his
father
developed
politics
interested
him
he
told
himself
he
was
a
born
politician
was
diplomatic
approachable
had
a
talent
for
intrigue
a
gift
of
making
friends
easily
and
most
indispensable
of
all
a
veritable
genius
for
putting
influential
men
under
obligations
to
himself
already
he
had
succeeded
in
gaining
for
himself
two
important
offices
in
the
municipal
administration
of
san
francisco
where
he
had
his
home
sheriff
attorney
and
later
on
assistant
district
attorney
but
with
these
small
achievements
he
was
by
no
means
satisfied
the
largeness
of
his
father
character
modified
in
lyman
by
a
of
selfishness
had
produced
in
him
an
inordinate
ambition
where
his
father
during
his
political
career
had
considered
himself
only
as
an
exponent
of
principles
he
strove
to
apply
lyman
saw
but
the
office
his
own
personal
aggrandisement
he
belonged
to
the
new
school
wherein
objects
were
attained
not
by
orations
before
senates
and
assemblies
but
by
sessions
of
committees
caucuses
compromises
and
expedients
his
goal
was
to
be
in
fact
what
magnus
was
only
in
name
governor
lyman
with
shut
teeth
had
resolved
that
some
day
he
would
sit
in
the
gubernatorial
chair
in
sacramento
lyman
is
doing
well
answered
magnus
i
could
wish
he
was
more
pronounced
in
his
convictions
less
willing
to
compromise
but
i
believe
him
to
be
earnest
and
to
have
a
talent
for
government
and
civics
his
ambition
does
him
credit
and
if
he
occupied
himself
a
little
more
with
means
and
a
little
less
with
ends
he
would
i
am
sure
be
the
ideal
servant
of
the
people
but
i
am
not
afraid
the
time
will
come
when
the
state
will
be
proud
of
as
harran
turned
the
team
into
the
driveway
that
led
up
to
house
magnus
remarked
harran
is
that
young
annixter
himself
on
the
porch
harran
nodded
and
remarked
by
the
way
governor
i
would
seem
too
cordial
in
your
invitation
to
annixter
he
will
be
glad
to
come
i
know
but
if
you
seem
to
want
him
too
much
it
is
just
like
his
confounded
obstinacy
to
make
there
is
something
in
that
observed
magnus
as
harran
drew
up
at
the
porch
of
the
house
he
is
a
queer
fellow
but
in
many
ways
annixter
was
lying
in
the
hammock
on
the
porch
precisely
as
presley
had
found
him
the
day
before
reading
david
copperfield
and
stuffing
himself
with
dried
prunes
when
he
recognised
magnus
however
he
got
up
though
careful
to
give
evidence
of
the
most
poignant
discomfort
he
explained
his
difficulty
at
great
length
protesting
that
his
stomach
was
no
better
than
a
spongebag
would
magnus
and
harran
get
down
and
have
a
drink
there
was
whiskey
somewhere
about
magnus
however
declined
he
stated
his
errand
asking
annixter
to
come
over
to
los
muertos
that
evening
for
seven
dinner
osterman
and
broderson
would
be
there
at
once
annixter
even
to
harran
surprise
put
his
chin
in
the
air
making
excuses
fearing
to
compromise
himself
if
he
accepted
too
readily
no
he
did
not
think
he
could
get
around
was
sure
of
it
in
fact
there
were
certain
businesses
he
had
on
hand
that
evening
he
had
practically
made
an
appointment
with
a
man
at
bonneville
then
too
he
was
thinking
of
going
up
to
san
francisco
and
needed
his
sleep
would
go
to
bed
early
and
besides
all
that
he
was
a
very
sick
man
his
stomach
was
out
of
whack
if
he
moved
about
it
brought
the
gripes
back
no
they
must
get
along
without
him
magnus
knowing
with
whom
he
had
to
deal
did
not
urge
the
point
being
convinced
that
annixter
would
argue
over
the
affair
the
rest
of
the
morning
he
himself
in
the
buggy
and
harran
gathered
up
the
reins
well
he
observed
you
know
your
business
best
come
if
you
can
we
dine
at
i
hear
you
are
going
to
farm
the
whole
of
los
muertos
this
season
remarked
annixter
with
a
certain
note
of
challenge
in
his
voice
we
are
thinking
of
it
replied
magnus
annixter
grunted
scornfully
did
you
get
the
message
i
sent
you
by
presley
he
began
tactless
blunt
and
direct
annixter
was
quite
capable
of
calling
even
magnus
a
fool
to
his
face
but
before
he
could
proceed
behrman
in
his
single
buggy
turned
into
the
gate
and
driving
leisurely
up
to
the
porch
halted
on
the
other
side
of
magnus
team
gentlemen
he
remarked
nodding
to
the
two
derricks
as
though
he
had
not
seen
them
earlier
in
the
day
mr
annixter
how
do
you
do
what
in
hell
do
you
want
demanded
annixter
with
a
stare
behrman
hiccoughed
slightly
and
passed
a
fat
hand
over
his
waistcoat
why
not
very
much
annixter
he
replied
ignoring
the
belligerency
in
the
young
ranchman
voice
but
i
will
have
to
lodge
a
protest
against
you
annixter
in
the
matter
of
keeping
your
line
fence
in
repair
the
sheep
were
all
over
the
track
last
night
this
side
the
long
trestle
and
i
am
afraid
they
have
seriously
disturbed
our
ballast
along
there
we
the
railroad
ca
fence
along
our
right
of
way
the
farmers
have
the
prescriptive
right
of
that
so
we
have
to
look
to
you
to
keep
your
fence
in
repair
i
am
sorry
but
i
shall
have
to
protest
annixter
returned
to
the
hammock
and
stretched
himself
out
in
it
to
his
full
length
remarking
tranquilly
go
to
the
devil
it
is
as
much
to
your
interest
as
to
ours
that
the
safety
of
the
public
you
heard
what
i
said
go
to
the
devil
that
all
may
show
obstinacy
annixter
but
suddenly
annixter
jumped
up
again
and
came
to
the
edge
of
the
porch
his
face
flamed
scarlet
to
the
roots
of
his
stiff
yellow
hair
he
thrust
out
his
jaw
aggressively
clenching
his
teeth
you
he
vociferated
i
tell
you
what
you
are
you
a
a
a
pip
to
his
mind
it
was
the
last
insult
the
most
outrageous
calumny
he
had
no
worse
epithet
at
his
command
may
show
obstinacy
pursued
behrman
bent
upon
finishing
the
phrase
but
it
do
show
common
i
mend
my
fence
and
then
again
maybe
i
wo
mend
my
fence
shouted
annixter
i
know
what
you
mean
that
wild
engine
last
night
well
you
no
right
to
run
at
that
speed
in
the
town
how
the
town
limits
the
sheep
were
this
side
the
long
well
that
in
the
town
limits
of
why
annixter
the
long
trestle
is
a
good
two
miles
out
of
annixter
squared
himself
leaping
to
the
chance
of
an
argument
two
miles
it
not
a
mile
and
a
quarter
no
it
not
a
mile
leave
it
to
magnus
oh
i
know
nothing
about
it
declared
magnus
refusing
to
be
involved
yes
you
do
yes
you
do
too
any
fool
knows
how
far
it
is
from
guadalajara
to
the
long
trestle
it
about
of
a
from
the
depot
of
the
town
remarked
behrman
placidly
to
the
head
of
the
long
trestle
is
about
two
that
a
lie
and
you
know
it
a
lie
shouted
the
other
furious
at
behrman
calmness
and
i
can
prove
it
a
lie
i
walked
that
distance
on
the
upper
road
and
i
know
just
how
fast
i
walk
and
if
i
can
walk
four
miles
in
one
magnus
and
harran
drove
on
leaving
annixter
trying
to
draw
behrman
into
a
wrangle
when
at
length
behrman
as
well
took
himself
away
annixter
returned
to
his
hammock
finished
the
rest
of
his
prunes
and
read
another
chapter
of
then
he
put
the
book
open
over
his
face
and
went
to
sleep
an
hour
later
toward
noon
his
own
terrific
snoring
woke
him
up
suddenly
and
he
sat
up
rubbing
his
face
and
blinking
at
the
sunlight
there
was
a
bad
taste
in
his
mouth
from
sleeping
with
it
wide
open
and
going
into
the
of
the
house
he
mixed
himself
a
drink
of
whiskey
and
soda
and
swallowed
it
in
three
great
gulps
he
told
himself
that
he
felt
not
only
better
but
hungry
and
pressed
an
electric
button
in
the
wall
near
the
sideboard
three
times
to
let
the
kitchen
situated
in
a
separate
building
near
the
ranch
house
know
that
he
was
ready
for
his
dinner
as
he
did
so
an
idea
occurred
to
him
he
wondered
if
hilma
tree
would
bring
up
his
dinner
and
wait
on
the
table
while
he
ate
it
in
connection
with
his
ranch
annixter
ran
a
dairy
farm
on
a
very
small
scale
making
just
enough
butter
and
cheese
for
the
consumption
of
the
ranch
personnel
old
man
tree
his
wife
and
his
daughter
hilma
looked
after
the
dairy
but
there
was
not
always
work
enough
to
keep
the
three
of
them
occupied
and
hilma
at
times
made
herself
useful
in
other
ways
as
often
as
not
she
lent
a
hand
in
the
kitchen
and
two
or
three
times
a
week
she
took
her
mother
place
in
looking
after
annixter
house
making
the
beds
putting
his
room
to
rights
bringing
his
meals
up
from
the
kitchen
for
the
last
summer
she
had
been
away
visiting
with
relatives
in
one
of
the
towns
on
the
coast
but
the
week
previous
to
this
she
had
returned
and
annixter
had
come
upon
her
suddenly
one
day
in
the
dairy
making
cheese
the
sleeves
of
her
crisp
blue
shirt
waist
rolled
back
to
her
very
shoulders
annixter
had
carried
away
with
him
a
recollection
of
these
smooth
white
arms
of
hers
bare
to
the
shoulder
very
round
and
cool
and
fresh
he
would
not
have
believed
that
a
girl
so
young
should
have
had
arms
so
big
and
perfect
to
his
surprise
he
found
himself
thinking
of
her
after
he
had
gone
to
bed
that
night
and
in
the
morning
when
he
woke
he
was
bothered
to
know
whether
he
had
dreamed
about
hilma
fine
white
arms
over
night
then
abruptly
he
had
lost
patience
with
himself
for
being
so
occupied
with
the
subject
raging
and
furious
with
all
the
breed
of
feemales
a
fine
way
for
a
man
to
waste
his
time
he
had
had
his
experience
with
the
timid
little
creature
in
the
establishment
in
sacramento
that
was
enough
feemales
rot
none
of
them
in
his
thank
you
he
had
seen
hilma
tree
give
him
a
look
in
the
dairy
aha
he
saw
through
her
she
was
trying
to
get
a
hold
on
him
was
she
he
would
show
her
wait
till
he
saw
her
again
he
would
send
her
about
her
business
in
a
hurry
he
resolved
upon
a
terrible
demeanour
in
the
presence
of
the
dairy
girl
a
great
show
of
indifference
a
fierce
masculine
nonchalance
and
when
the
next
morning
she
brought
him
his
breakfast
he
had
been
smitten
dumb
as
soon
as
she
entered
the
room
glueing
his
eyes
upon
his
plate
his
elbows
close
to
his
side
awkward
clumsy
overwhelmed
with
constraint
while
true
to
his
convictions
as
a
and
genuinely
despising
hilma
both
as
a
girl
and
as
an
inferior
the
idea
of
her
worried
him
most
of
all
he
was
angry
with
himself
because
of
his
inane
sheepishness
when
she
was
about
he
at
first
had
told
himself
that
he
was
a
fool
not
to
be
able
to
ignore
her
existence
as
hitherto
and
then
that
he
was
a
greater
fool
not
to
take
advantage
of
his
position
certainly
he
had
not
the
remotest
idea
of
any
affection
but
hilma
was
a
fine
looking
girl
he
imagined
an
affair
with
her
as
he
reflected
upon
the
matter
now
scowling
abstractedly
at
the
button
of
the
electric
bell
turning
the
whole
business
over
in
his
mind
he
remembered
that
was
day
and
that
tree
would
be
occupied
in
the
dairy
that
meant
that
hilma
would
take
her
place
he
turned
to
the
mirror
of
the
sideboard
scrutinising
his
reflection
with
grim
disfavour
after
a
moment
rubbing
the
roughened
surface
of
his
chin
the
wrong
way
he
muttered
to
his
image
in
the
glass
that
a
mug
good
lord
what
a
looking
mug
then
after
a
silence
wonder
if
that
fool
feemale
will
be
up
here
he
crossed
over
into
his
bedroom
and
peeped
around
the
edge
of
the
lowered
curtain
the
window
looked
out
upon
the
tower
of
the
artesian
well
and
the
and
close
beside
it
as
he
watched
he
saw
hilma
come
out
from
the
and
hurry
across
toward
the
kitchen
evidently
she
was
going
to
see
about
his
dinner
but
as
she
passed
by
the
artesian
well
she
met
young
delaney
one
of
annixter
hands
coming
up
the
trail
by
the
irrigating
ditch
leading
his
horse
toward
the
stables
a
great
coil
of
barbed
wire
in
his
gloved
hands
and
a
pair
of
nippers
thrust
into
his
belt
no
doubt
he
had
been
mending
the
break
in
the
line
fence
by
the
long
trestle
annixter
saw
him
take
off
his
hat
as
he
met
hilma
and
the
two
stood
there
for
some
moments
talking
together
annixter
even
heard
hilma
laughing
very
gayly
at
something
delaney
was
saying
she
patted
his
horse
neck
affectionately
and
delaney
drawing
the
nippers
from
his
belt
made
as
if
to
pinch
her
arm
with
them
she
caught
at
his
wrist
and
pushed
him
away
laughing
again
to
annixter
mind
the
pair
seemed
astonishingly
intimate
brusquely
his
anger
flamed
up
ah
that
was
it
was
it
delaney
and
hilma
had
an
understanding
between
themselves
they
carried
on
their
affair
right
out
there
in
the
open
under
his
very
eyes
it
was
absolutely
disgusting
had
they
no
sense
of
decency
those
two
well
this
ended
it
he
would
stop
that
sort
of
thing
short
off
none
of
that
on
his
ranch
if
he
knew
it
no
sir
he
would
pack
that
girl
off
before
he
was
a
day
older
he
would
have
that
kind
about
the
place
not
much
she
have
to
get
out
he
would
talk
to
old
man
tree
about
it
this
afternoon
whatever
happened
he
insisted
upon
morality
and
my
dinner
he
suddenly
exclaimed
i
got
to
wait
and
go
hungry
and
maybe
get
sick
again
while
they
carry
on
their
disgusting
he
turned
about
on
the
instant
and
striding
over
to
the
electric
bell
rang
it
again
with
all
his
might
when
that
feemale
gets
up
here
he
declared
i
just
find
out
why
i
got
to
wait
like
this
i
take
her
down
to
the
queen
taste
i
lenient
enough
lord
knows
but
i
do
propose
to
be
imposed
upon
all
the
a
few
moments
later
while
annixter
was
pretending
to
read
the
county
newspaper
by
the
window
in
the
hilma
came
in
to
set
the
table
at
the
time
annixter
had
his
feet
cocked
on
the
window
ledge
and
was
smoking
a
cigar
but
as
soon
as
she
entered
the
room
he
without
premeditation
brought
his
feet
down
to
the
floor
and
crushed
out
the
lighted
tip
of
his
cigar
under
the
window
ledge
over
the
top
of
the
paper
he
glanced
at
her
covertly
from
time
to
time
though
hilma
was
only
nineteen
years
old
she
was
a
large
girl
with
all
the
development
of
a
much
older
woman
there
was
a
certain
generous
amplitude
to
the
full
round
curves
of
her
hips
and
shoulders
that
suggested
the
precocious
maturity
of
a
healthy
vigorous
animal
life
passed
under
the
hot
southern
sun
of
a
country
she
was
one
knew
at
a
glance
with
an
even
comfortable
balance
of
temperament
her
neck
was
thick
and
sloped
to
her
shoulders
with
full
beautiful
curves
and
under
her
chin
and
under
her
ears
the
flesh
was
as
white
and
smooth
as
floss
satin
shading
exquisitely
to
a
faint
delicate
brown
on
her
nape
at
the
roots
of
her
hair
her
throat
rounded
to
meet
her
chin
and
cheek
with
a
soft
swell
of
the
skin
tinted
pale
amber
in
the
shadows
but
blending
by
barely
perceptible
gradations
to
the
sweet
warm
flush
of
her
cheek
this
colour
on
her
temples
was
just
touched
with
a
certain
blueness
where
the
flesh
was
thin
over
the
fine
veining
underneath
her
eyes
were
light
brown
and
so
wide
open
that
on
the
slightest
provocation
the
full
disc
of
the
pupil
was
disclosed
the
lids
just
a
fraction
of
a
shade
darker
than
the
hue
of
her
face
were
edged
with
lashes
that
were
almost
black
while
these
lashes
were
not
long
they
were
thick
and
rimmed
her
eyes
with
a
fine
thin
line
her
mouth
was
rather
large
the
lips
shut
tight
and
nothing
could
have
been
more
graceful
more
charming
than
the
outline
of
these
full
lips
of
hers
and
her
round
white
chin
modulating
downward
with
a
certain
delicious
roundness
to
her
neck
her
throat
and
the
sweet
feminine
amplitude
of
her
breast
the
slightest
movement
of
her
head
and
shoulders
sent
a
gentle
undulation
through
all
this
beauty
of
soft
outlines
and
smooth
surfaces
the
delicate
amber
shadows
deepening
or
fading
or
losing
themselves
imperceptibly
in
the
pretty
of
her
cheeks
or
the
dark
shadow
of
her
thick
brown
hair
her
hair
seemed
almost
to
have
a
life
of
its
own
almost
thick
glossy
and
moist
lying
in
heavy
masses
over
her
forehead
over
her
small
ears
with
their
pink
lobes
and
far
down
upon
her
nape
deep
in
between
the
coils
and
braids
it
was
of
a
bitumen
brownness
but
in
the
sunlight
it
vibrated
with
a
sheen
like
tarnished
gold
like
most
large
girls
her
movements
were
not
hurried
and
this
indefinite
deliberateness
of
gesture
this
slow
grace
this
certain
ease
of
attitude
was
a
charm
that
was
all
her
own
but
hilma
greatest
charm
of
all
was
her
simplicity
a
simplicity
that
was
not
only
in
the
calm
regularity
of
her
face
with
its
statuesque
evenness
of
contour
its
broad
surface
of
cheek
and
forehead
and
the
masses
of
her
straight
smooth
hair
but
was
apparent
as
well
in
the
long
line
of
her
carriage
from
her
foot
to
her
waist
and
the
single
deep
swell
from
her
waist
to
her
shoulder
almost
unconsciously
she
dressed
in
harmony
with
this
note
of
simplicity
and
on
this
occasion
wore
a
skirt
of
plain
dark
blue
calico
and
a
white
shirt
waist
crisp
from
the
laundry
and
yet
for
all
the
dignity
of
this
rigourous
simplicity
there
were
about
hilma
small
contradictory
suggestions
of
feminine
daintiness
charming
beyond
words
even
annixter
could
not
help
noticing
that
her
feet
were
narrow
and
slender
and
that
the
little
steel
buckles
of
her
low
shoes
were
polished
bright
and
that
her
fingertips
and
nails
were
of
a
fine
rosy
pink
he
found
himself
wondering
how
it
was
that
a
girl
in
hilma
position
should
be
able
to
keep
herself
so
pretty
so
trim
so
clean
and
feminine
but
he
reflected
that
her
work
was
chiefly
in
the
dairy
and
even
there
of
the
lightest
order
she
was
on
the
ranch
more
for
the
sake
of
being
with
her
parents
than
from
any
necessity
of
employment
vaguely
he
seemed
to
understand
that
in
that
great
new
land
of
the
west
in
the
healthy
life
of
the
ranches
where
the
conditions
of
earning
a
livelihood
were
of
the
easiest
refinement
among
the
younger
women
was
easily
to
be
found
not
the
refinement
of
education
nor
culture
but
the
natural
intuitive
refinement
of
the
woman
not
as
yet
defiled
and
crushed
out
by
the
sordid
strenuous
of
districts
it
was
the
original
intended
and
natural
delicacy
of
an
elemental
existence
close
to
nature
close
to
life
close
to
the
great
kindly
earth
as
hilma
laid
the
her
arms
opened
to
their
widest
reach
the
white
cloth
setting
a
little
glisten
of
reflected
light
underneath
the
chin
annixter
stirred
in
his
place
uneasily
oh
it
you
is
it
miss
hilma
he
remarked
for
the
sake
of
saying
something
how
do
you
do
sir
she
answered
looking
up
resting
for
a
moment
on
her
outspread
palms
i
hope
you
are
her
voice
was
low
in
pitch
and
of
a
velvety
huskiness
seeming
to
come
more
from
her
chest
than
from
her
throat
well
i
some
better
growled
annixter
then
suddenly
he
demanded
where
that
dog
a
decrepit
irish
setter
sometimes
made
his
appearance
in
and
about
the
ranch
house
sleeping
under
the
bed
and
eating
when
anyone
about
the
place
thought
to
give
him
a
plate
of
bread
annixter
had
no
particular
interest
in
the
dog
for
weeks
at
a
time
he
ignored
its
existence
it
was
not
his
dog
but
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
not
let
the
subject
rest
for
no
reason
that
he
could
explain
even
to
himself
he
recurred
to
it
continually
he
questioned
hilma
minutely
all
about
the
dog
who
owned
him
how
old
did
she
think
he
was
did
she
imagine
the
dog
was
sick
where
had
he
got
to
maybe
he
had
crawled
off
to
die
somewhere
he
recurred
to
the
subject
all
through
the
meal
apparently
he
could
talk
of
nothing
else
and
as
she
finally
went
away
after
clearing
off
the
table
he
went
onto
the
porch
and
called
after
her
say
miss
yes
if
that
dog
turns
up
again
you
let
me
very
well
annixter
returned
to
the
and
sat
down
in
the
chair
he
had
just
vacated
to
hell
with
the
dog
he
muttered
enraged
he
could
not
tell
why
when
at
length
he
allowed
his
attention
to
wander
from
hilma
tree
he
found
that
he
had
been
staring
fixedly
at
a
thermometer
upon
the
wall
opposite
and
this
made
him
think
that
it
had
long
been
his
intention
to
buy
a
fine
barometer
an
instrument
that
could
be
accurately
depended
on
but
the
barometer
suggested
the
present
condition
of
the
weather
and
the
likelihood
of
rain
in
such
case
much
was
to
be
done
in
the
way
of
getting
the
seed
ready
and
overhauling
his
ploughs
and
drills
he
had
not
been
away
from
the
house
in
two
days
it
was
time
to
be
up
and
doing
he
determined
to
put
in
the
afternoon
taking
a
look
around
and
have
a
late
supper
he
would
not
go
to
los
muertos
he
would
ignore
magnus
derrick
invitation
possibly
though
it
might
be
well
to
run
over
and
see
what
was
up
if
i
do
he
said
to
himself
i
ride
the
the
buckskin
was
a
broncho
that
fought
like
a
fiend
under
the
saddle
until
the
quirt
and
spur
brought
her
to
her
senses
but
annixter
remembered
that
the
trees
cottage
next
the
looked
out
upon
the
stables
and
perhaps
hilma
would
see
him
while
he
was
mounting
the
horse
and
be
impressed
with
his
courage
huh
grunted
annixter
under
his
breath
i
should
like
to
see
that
fool
delaney
try
to
bust
that
bronch
that
what
i
like
to
however
as
annixter
stepped
from
the
porch
of
the
ranch
house
he
was
surprised
to
notice
a
grey
haze
over
all
the
sky
the
sunlight
was
gone
there
was
a
sense
of
coolness
in
the
air
the
on
the
barn
a
fine
golden
trotting
horse
with
flamboyant
mane
and
tail
was
veering
in
a
southwest
wind
evidently
the
expected
rain
was
close
at
hand
annixter
crossed
over
to
the
stables
reflecting
that
he
could
ride
the
buckskin
to
the
trees
cottage
and
tell
hilma
that
he
would
not
be
home
to
supper
the
conference
at
los
muertos
would
be
an
admirable
excuse
for
this
and
upon
the
spot
he
resolved
to
go
over
to
the
derrick
ranch
house
after
all
as
he
passed
the
trees
cottage
he
observed
with
satisfaction
that
hilma
was
going
to
and
fro
in
the
front
room
if
he
busted
the
buckskin
in
the
yard
before
the
stable
she
could
not
help
but
see
annixter
found
the
stableman
in
the
back
of
the
barn
greasing
the
axles
of
the
buggy
and
ordered
him
to
put
the
saddle
on
the
buckskin
why
i
do
think
she
here
sir
answered
the
stableman
glancing
into
the
stalls
no
i
remember
now
delaney
took
her
out
just
after
dinner
his
other
horse
went
lame
and
he
wanted
to
go
down
by
the
long
trestle
to
mend
the
fence
he
started
out
but
had
to
come
oh
delaney
got
her
did
he
yes
sir
he
had
a
circus
with
her
but
he
busted
her
right
enough
when
it
comes
to
horse
delaney
can
wipe
the
eye
of
any
in
the
county
i
he
can
can
he
observed
annixter
then
after
a
silence
well
all
right
billy
put
my
saddle
on
whatever
you
got
here
i
going
over
to
los
muertos
this
want
to
look
out
for
the
rain
annixter
remarked
billy
guess
we
have
rain
before
i
take
a
rubber
coat
answered
annixter
bring
the
horse
up
to
the
ranch
house
when
you
annixter
returned
to
the
house
to
look
for
his
rubber
coat
in
deep
disgust
not
permitting
himself
to
glance
toward
the
and
the
trees
cottage
but
as
he
reached
the
porch
he
heard
the
telephone
ringing
his
call
it
was
presley
who
rang
up
from
los
muertos
he
had
heard
from
harran
that
annixter
was
perhaps
coming
over
that
evening
if
he
came
would
he
mind
bringing
over
his
presley
bicycle
he
had
left
it
at
the
quien
sabe
ranch
the
day
before
and
had
forgotten
to
come
back
that
way
for
it
well
objected
annixter
a
surly
note
in
his
voice
i
was
going
to
ride
oh
never
mind
then
returned
presley
easily
i
was
to
blame
for
forgetting
it
do
bother
about
it
i
come
over
some
of
these
days
and
get
it
annixter
hung
up
the
transmitter
with
a
vehement
wrench
and
stamped
out
of
the
room
banging
the
door
he
found
his
rubber
coat
hanging
in
the
hallway
and
swung
into
it
with
a
fierce
movement
of
the
shoulders
that
all
but
started
the
seams
everything
seemed
to
conspire
to
thwart
him
it
was
just
like
that
crazy
poet
presley
to
forget
his
wheel
well
he
could
come
after
it
himself
he
annixter
would
ride
some
horse
anyhow
when
he
came
out
upon
the
porch
he
saw
the
wheel
leaning
against
the
fence
where
presley
had
left
it
if
it
stayed
there
much
longer
the
rain
would
catch
it
annixter
ripped
out
an
oath
at
every
moment
his
was
increasing
yet
for
all
that
he
went
back
to
the
stable
pushing
the
bicycle
before
him
and
countermanded
his
order
directing
the
stableman
to
get
the
buggy
ready
he
himself
carefully
stowed
presley
bicycle
under
the
seat
covering
it
with
a
couple
of
empty
sacks
and
a
tarpaulin
carriage
cover
while
he
was
doing
this
the
stableman
uttered
an
exclamation
and
paused
in
the
act
of
backing
the
horse
into
the
shafts
holding
up
a
hand
listening
from
the
hollow
roof
of
the
barn
and
from
the
thick
padding
of
dust
over
the
ground
outside
and
from
among
the
leaves
of
the
few
nearby
trees
and
plants
there
came
a
vast
monotonous
murmur
that
seemed
to
issue
from
all
quarters
of
the
horizon
at
once
a
prolonged
and
subdued
rustling
sound
steady
even
persistent
there
your
rain
announced
the
stableman
the
first
of
the
and
i
got
to
be
out
in
it
fumed
annixter
and
i
suppose
those
swine
will
quit
work
on
the
big
barn
when
the
buggy
was
finally
ready
he
put
on
his
rubber
coat
climbed
in
and
without
waiting
for
the
stableman
to
raise
the
top
drove
out
into
the
rain
a
cigar
in
his
teeth
as
he
passed
the
he
saw
hilma
standing
in
the
doorway
holding
out
her
hand
to
the
rain
her
face
turned
upward
toward
the
grey
sky
amused
and
interested
at
this
first
shower
of
the
wet
season
she
was
so
absorbed
that
she
did
not
see
annixter
and
his
clumsy
nod
in
her
direction
passed
unnoticed
she
did
it
on
purpose
annixter
told
himself
chewing
fiercely
on
his
cigar
cuts
me
now
hey
well
this
does
settle
it
she
leaves
this
ranch
before
i
a
day
he
decided
that
he
would
put
off
his
tour
of
inspection
till
the
next
day
travelling
in
the
buggy
as
he
did
he
must
keep
to
the
road
which
led
to
derrick
in
very
roundabout
fashion
by
way
of
guadalajara
this
rain
would
reduce
the
thick
dust
of
the
road
to
two
feet
of
viscid
mud
it
would
take
him
quite
three
hours
to
reach
the
ranch
house
on
los
muertos
he
thought
of
delaney
and
the
buckskin
and
ground
his
teeth
and
all
this
trouble
if
you
please
because
of
a
fool
feemale
girl
a
fine
way
for
him
to
waste
his
time
well
now
he
was
done
with
it
his
decision
was
taken
now
she
should
pack
steadily
the
rain
increased
there
was
no
wind
the
thick
veil
of
wet
descended
straight
from
sky
to
earth
blurring
distant
outlines
spreading
a
vast
sheen
of
grey
over
all
the
landscape
its
volume
became
greater
the
prolonged
murmuring
note
took
on
a
deeper
tone
at
the
gate
to
the
road
which
led
across
dyke
toward
guadalajara
annixter
was
obliged
to
descend
and
raise
the
top
of
the
buggy
in
doing
so
he
caught
the
flesh
of
his
hand
in
the
joint
of
the
iron
elbow
that
supported
the
top
and
pinched
it
cruelly
it
was
the
last
misery
the
culmination
of
a
long
train
of
wretchedness
on
the
instant
he
hated
hilma
tree
so
fiercely
that
his
sharply
set
teeth
all
but
bit
his
cigar
in
two
while
he
was
grabbing
and
wrenching
at
the
the
water
from
his
hat
brim
dripping
down
upon
his
nose
the
horse
restive
under
the
drench
of
the
rain
moved
uneasily
you
he
shouted
inarticulate
with
exasperation
you
you
wait
till
i
get
hold
of
you
whoa
you
but
there
was
an
interruption
delaney
riding
the
buckskin
came
around
a
bend
in
the
road
at
a
slow
trot
and
annixter
getting
into
the
buggy
again
found
himself
face
to
face
with
him
why
hello
annixter
said
he
pulling
up
kind
of
sort
of
wet
is
it
annixter
his
face
suddenly
scarlet
sat
back
in
his
place
abruptly
exclaiming
oh
oh
there
you
are
are
you
i
been
down
there
explained
delaney
with
a
motion
of
his
head
toward
the
railroad
to
mend
that
break
in
the
fence
by
the
long
trestle
and
i
thought
while
i
was
about
it
i
follow
down
along
the
fence
toward
guadalajara
to
see
if
there
were
any
more
breaks
but
i
guess
it
all
oh
you
guess
it
all
right
do
you
observed
annixter
through
his
teeth
why
why
yes
returned
the
other
bewildered
at
the
truculent
ring
in
annixter
voice
i
mended
that
break
by
the
long
trestle
just
now
and
well
why
did
you
mend
it
a
week
ago
shouted
annixter
wrathfully
i
been
looking
for
you
all
the
morning
i
have
and
who
told
you
you
could
take
that
buckskin
and
the
sheep
were
all
over
the
right
of
way
last
night
because
of
that
break
and
here
that
filthy
pip
behrman
comes
down
here
this
morning
and
wants
to
make
trouble
for
suddenly
he
cried
out
what
do
i
feed
you
for
what
do
i
keep
you
around
here
for
think
it
just
to
fatten
up
your
carcass
hey
why
annixter
began
delaney
and
do
talk
to
me
vociferated
the
other
exciting
himself
with
his
own
noise
do
you
say
a
word
to
me
even
to
apologise
if
i
spoken
to
you
once
about
that
break
i
spoken
fifty
why
sir
declared
delaney
beginning
to
get
indignant
the
sheep
did
it
themselves
last
i
told
you
not
to
talk
to
me
clamoured
annixter
but
say
look
here
get
off
the
ranch
you
get
off
the
ranch
and
taking
that
buckskin
against
my
express
orders
i
wo
have
your
kind
about
the
place
not
much
i
enough
lord
knows
but
i
do
propose
to
be
imposed
on
all
the
time
pack
off
you
understand
and
do
it
lively
go
to
the
foreman
and
tell
him
i
told
him
to
pay
you
off
and
then
clear
out
and
you
hear
me
he
concluded
with
a
menacing
outthrust
of
his
lower
jaw
you
hear
me
if
i
catch
you
hanging
around
the
ranch
house
after
this
or
if
i
so
much
as
see
you
on
quien
sabe
i
show
you
the
way
off
of
it
my
friend
at
the
toe
of
my
boot
now
then
get
out
of
the
way
and
let
me
angry
beyond
the
power
of
retort
delaney
drove
the
spurs
into
the
buckskin
and
passed
the
buggy
in
a
single
bound
annixter
gathered
up
the
reins
and
drove
on
muttering
to
himself
and
occasionally
looking
back
to
observe
the
buckskin
flying
toward
the
ranch
house
in
a
spattering
shower
of
mud
delaney
urging
her
on
his
head
bent
down
against
the
falling
rain
huh
grunted
annixter
with
grim
satisfaction
a
certain
sense
of
good
humour
at
length
returning
to
him
that
just
about
takes
the
saleratus
out
of
your
dough
my
a
little
farther
on
annixter
got
out
of
the
buggy
a
second
time
to
open
another
gate
that
let
him
out
upon
the
upper
road
not
far
distant
from
guadalajara
it
was
the
road
that
connected
that
town
with
bonneville
and
that
ran
parallel
with
the
railroad
tracks
on
the
other
side
of
the
track
he
could
see
the
infinite
extension
of
the
brown
bare
land
of
los
muertos
turning
now
to
a
soft
moist
welter
of
fertility
under
the
insistent
caressing
of
the
rain
the
hard
clods
were
decomposing
the
crevices
between
drinking
the
wet
with
an
eager
sucking
noise
but
the
prospect
was
dreary
the
distant
horizons
were
blotted
under
drifting
mists
of
rain
the
eternal
monotony
of
the
earth
lay
open
to
the
sombre
low
sky
without
a
single
adornment
without
a
single
variation
from
its
melancholy
flatness
near
at
hand
the
wires
between
the
telegraph
poles
vibrated
with
a
faint
humming
under
the
multitudinous
fingering
of
the
myriad
of
falling
drops
striking
among
them
and
dripping
off
steadily
from
one
to
another
the
poles
themselves
were
dark
and
swollen
and
glistening
with
wet
while
the
little
cones
of
glass
on
the
transverse
bars
reflected
the
dull
grey
light
of
the
end
of
the
afternoon
as
annixter
was
about
to
drive
on
a
freight
train
passed
coming
from
guadalajara
going
northward
toward
bonneville
fresno
and
san
francisco
it
was
a
long
train
moving
slowly
methodically
with
a
measured
coughing
of
its
locomotive
and
a
rhythmic
cadence
of
its
trucks
over
the
interstices
of
the
rails
on
two
or
three
of
the
flat
cars
near
its
end
annixter
plainly
saw
magnus
derrick
ploughs
their
bright
coating
of
red
and
green
paint
setting
a
single
brilliant
note
in
all
this
array
of
grey
and
brown
annixter
halted
watching
the
train
file
past
carrying
ploughs
away
from
his
ranch
at
this
very
time
of
the
first
rain
when
they
would
be
most
needed
he
watched
it
silent
thoughtful
and
without
articulate
comment
even
after
it
passed
he
sat
in
his
place
a
long
time
watching
it
lose
itself
slowly
in
the
distance
its
prolonged
rumble
diminishing
to
a
faint
murmur
soon
he
heard
the
engine
sounding
its
whistle
for
the
long
trestle
but
the
moving
train
no
longer
carried
with
it
that
impression
of
terror
and
destruction
that
had
so
thrilled
presley
imagination
the
night
before
it
passed
slowly
on
its
way
with
a
mournful
roll
of
wheels
like
the
passing
of
a
cortege
like
a
file
of
charioting
dead
bodies
the
engine
smoke
enveloping
it
in
a
mournful
veil
leaving
a
sense
of
melancholy
in
its
wake
moving
past
there
lugubrious
lamentable
infinitely
sad
under
the
grey
sky
and
under
the
grey
mist
of
rain
which
continued
to
fall
with
a
subdued
rustling
sound
steady
persistent
a
vast
monotonous
murmur
that
seemed
to
come
from
all
quarters
of
the
horizon
at
once
chapter
iii
when
annixter
arrived
at
the
los
muertos
ranch
house
that
same
evening
he
found
a
little
group
already
assembled
in
the
magnus
derrick
wearing
the
frock
coat
of
broadcloth
that
he
had
put
on
for
the
occasion
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fireplace
harran
sat
close
at
hand
one
leg
thrown
over
the
arm
of
his
chair
presley
lounged
on
the
sofa
in
corduroys
and
high
laced
boots
smoking
cigarettes
broderson
leaned
on
his
folded
arms
at
one
corner
of
the
dining
table
and
genslinger
editor
and
proprietor
of
the
principal
newspaper
of
the
county
the
bonneville
mercury
stood
with
his
hat
and
driving
gloves
under
his
arm
opposite
derrick
a
glass
of
whiskey
and
water
in
his
hand
as
annixter
entered
he
heard
genslinger
observe
i
have
a
leader
in
the
that
will
interest
you
people
there
some
talk
of
your
ranch
lands
being
graded
in
value
this
winter
i
suppose
you
will
all
buy
in
an
instant
the
editor
words
had
riveted
upon
him
the
attention
of
every
man
in
the
room
annixter
broke
the
moment
silence
that
followed
with
the
remark
well
it
about
time
they
graded
these
lands
of
the
question
in
issue
in
genslinger
remark
was
of
the
most
vital
interest
to
the
ranchers
around
bonneville
and
guadalajara
neither
magnus
derrick
broderson
annixter
nor
osterman
actually
owned
all
the
ranches
which
they
worked
as
yet
the
vast
majority
of
these
wheat
lands
were
the
property
of
the
and
the
explanation
of
this
condition
of
affairs
went
back
to
the
early
history
of
the
pacific
and
southwestern
when
as
a
bonus
for
the
construction
of
the
road
the
national
government
had
granted
to
the
company
the
odd
numbered
sections
of
land
on
either
side
of
the
proposed
line
of
route
for
a
distance
of
twenty
miles
indisputably
these
sections
belonged
to
the
and
the
sections
being
government
property
could
be
and
had
been
taken
up
by
the
ranchers
but
the
railroad
sections
or
as
they
were
called
the
alternate
sections
would
have
to
be
purchased
direct
from
the
railroad
itself
but
this
had
not
prevented
the
farmers
from
coming
in
upon
that
part
of
the
san
joaquin
long
before
this
the
railroad
had
thrown
open
these
lands
and
by
means
of
circulars
distributed
broadcast
throughout
the
state
had
expressly
invited
settlement
thereon
at
that
time
patents
had
not
been
issued
to
the
railroad
for
their
sections
but
as
soon
as
the
land
was
patented
the
railroad
would
grade
it
in
value
and
offer
it
for
sale
the
first
occupants
having
the
first
chance
of
purchase
the
price
of
these
lands
was
to
be
fixed
by
the
price
the
government
put
upon
its
own
adjoining
lands
about
two
dollars
and
a
half
per
acre
with
cultivation
and
improvement
the
ranches
must
inevitably
appreciate
in
value
there
was
every
chance
to
make
fortunes
when
the
railroad
lands
about
bonneville
had
been
thrown
open
there
had
been
almost
a
rush
in
the
matter
of
settlement
and
broderson
annixter
derrick
and
osterman
being
foremost
with
their
claims
had
secured
the
pick
of
the
country
but
the
land
once
settled
upon
the
and
seemed
to
be
in
no
hurry
as
to
fixing
exactly
the
value
of
its
sections
included
in
the
various
ranches
and
offering
them
for
sale
the
matter
dragged
along
from
year
to
year
was
forgotten
for
months
together
being
only
brought
to
mind
on
such
occasions
as
this
when
the
rumour
spread
that
the
general
office
was
about
to
take
definite
action
in
the
affair
as
soon
as
the
railroad
wants
to
talk
business
with
me
observed
annixter
about
selling
me
their
interest
in
quien
sabe
i
ready
the
land
has
more
than
quadrupled
in
value
i
bet
i
could
sell
it
for
fifteen
dollars
an
acre
and
if
i
buy
of
the
railroad
for
two
and
a
half
an
acre
there
boodle
in
the
for
two
and
a
half
exclaimed
genslinger
you
do
suppose
the
railroad
will
let
their
land
go
for
any
such
figure
as
that
do
you
wherever
did
you
get
that
idea
from
the
circulars
and
pamphlets
answered
harran
that
the
railroad
issued
to
us
when
they
opened
these
lands
they
are
pledged
to
that
even
the
and
could
break
such
a
pledge
as
that
you
are
new
in
the
country
genslinger
you
do
remember
the
conditions
upon
which
we
took
up
this
and
our
improvements
exclaimed
annixter
why
magnus
and
i
have
put
about
five
thousand
dollars
between
us
into
that
irrigating
ditch
already
i
guess
we
are
not
improving
the
land
just
to
make
it
valuable
for
the
railroad
people
no
matter
how
much
we
improve
the
land
or
how
much
it
increases
in
value
they
have
got
to
stick
by
their
agreement
on
the
basis
of
per
acre
here
one
case
where
the
and
do
get
everything
in
genslinger
frowned
perplexed
i
am
new
in
the
country
as
harran
says
he
answered
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there
no
fairness
in
that
proposition
the
presence
of
the
railroad
has
helped
increase
the
value
of
your
ranches
quite
as
much
as
your
improvements
why
should
you
get
all
the
benefit
of
the
rise
in
value
and
the
railroad
nothing
the
fair
way
would
be
to
share
it
between
i
do
care
anything
about
that
declared
annixter
they
agreed
to
charge
but
and
they
got
to
stick
to
well
murmured
genslinger
from
what
i
know
of
the
affair
i
believe
the
and
intends
to
sell
for
an
acre
at
all
the
managers
of
the
road
want
the
best
price
they
can
get
for
everything
in
these
hard
times
are
ever
very
hard
for
the
railroad
hazards
old
broderson
broderson
was
the
oldest
man
in
the
room
he
was
about
years
of
age
venerable
with
a
white
beard
his
figure
bent
earthwards
with
hard
work
he
was
a
man
painfully
conscientious
in
his
statements
lest
he
should
be
unjust
to
somebody
a
slow
thinker
unable
to
let
a
subject
drop
when
once
he
had
started
upon
it
he
had
no
sooner
uttered
his
remark
about
hard
times
than
he
was
moved
to
qualify
it
hard
times
he
repeated
a
troubled
perplexed
note
in
his
voice
well
yes
yes
i
suppose
the
road
does
have
hard
times
maybe
everybody
does
of
course
i
did
mean
that
exactly
i
believe
in
being
just
and
fair
to
everybody
i
mean
that
we
got
to
use
their
lines
and
pay
their
charges
good
years
and
bad
years
the
and
being
the
only
road
in
the
state
that
is
well
when
i
say
the
only
road
no
i
wo
say
the
only
road
of
course
there
are
other
roads
there
the
and
and
the
san
francisco
and
north
pacific
that
runs
up
to
ukiah
i
got
a
in
ukiah
that
not
much
of
a
wheat
country
round
ukiah
though
they
do
grow
some
wheat
there
come
to
think
but
i
guess
it
too
far
north
well
of
course
there
is
much
perhaps
sixty
thousand
acres
in
the
whole
county
if
you
include
barley
and
oats
i
do
know
maybe
it
nearer
forty
thousand
i
remember
very
well
that
a
good
many
years
ago
i
but
annixter
at
the
end
of
all
patience
turned
to
genslinger
cutting
short
the
old
man
oh
rot
of
course
the
railroad
will
sell
at
he
cried
we
got
the
look
to
them
then
annixter
retorted
genslinger
significantly
look
to
them
be
sure
that
you
are
soon
after
this
genslinger
took
himself
away
and
derrick
chinaman
came
in
to
set
the
table
what
do
you
suppose
he
meant
asked
broderson
when
genslinger
was
gone
about
this
land
business
said
annixter
oh
i
do
know
some
tom
fool
idea
have
we
got
their
terms
printed
in
black
and
white
in
their
circulars
there
their
oh
as
to
pledges
murmured
broderson
the
railroad
is
not
always
too
much
hindered
by
where
osterman
demanded
annixter
abruptly
changing
the
subject
as
if
it
were
not
worth
discussion
is
that
goat
osterman
coming
down
here
you
telephoned
him
did
you
presley
inquired
magnus
presley
had
taken
princess
nathalie
upon
his
knee
stroking
her
long
sleek
hair
and
the
cat
stupefied
with
beatitude
had
closed
her
eyes
to
two
fine
lines
clawing
softly
at
the
corduroy
of
presley
trousers
with
alternate
paws
yes
sir
returned
presley
he
said
he
would
be
and
as
he
spoke
young
osterman
arrived
he
was
a
young
fellow
but
singularly
inclined
to
baldness
his
ears
very
red
and
large
stuck
out
at
right
angles
from
either
side
of
his
head
and
his
mouth
too
was
large
a
great
horizontal
slit
beneath
his
nose
his
cheeks
were
of
a
brownish
red
the
cheek
bones
a
little
salient
his
face
was
that
of
a
comic
actor
a
singer
of
songs
a
man
never
at
a
loss
for
an
answer
continually
striving
to
make
a
laugh
but
he
took
no
great
interest
in
ranching
and
left
the
management
of
his
land
to
his
superintendents
and
foremen
he
himself
living
in
bonneville
he
was
a
poser
a
wearer
of
clothes
forever
acting
a
part
striving
to
create
an
impression
to
draw
attention
to
himself
he
was
not
without
a
certain
energy
but
he
devoted
it
to
small
ends
to
perfecting
himself
in
little
accomplishments
continually
running
after
some
new
thing
incapable
of
persisting
long
in
any
one
course
at
one
moment
his
mania
would
be
fencing
the
next
tricks
the
next
archery
for
upwards
of
one
month
he
had
devoted
himself
to
learning
how
to
play
two
banjos
simultaneously
then
abandoning
this
had
developed
a
sudden
passion
for
stamped
leather
work
and
had
made
a
quantity
of
purses
tennis
belts
and
hat
bands
which
he
presented
to
young
ladies
of
his
acquaintance
it
was
his
policy
never
to
make
an
enemy
he
was
liked
far
better
than
he
was
respected
people
spoke
of
him
as
that
goat
osterman
or
that
fool
osterman
kid
and
invited
him
to
dinner
he
was
of
the
sort
who
somehow
can
not
be
ignored
if
only
because
of
his
clamour
he
made
himself
important
if
he
had
one
abiding
trait
it
was
his
desire
of
astonishing
people
and
in
some
way
best
known
to
himself
managed
to
cause
the
circulation
of
the
most
extraordinary
stories
wherein
he
himself
was
the
chief
actor
he
was
glib
voluble
dexterous
ubiquitous
a
teller
of
funny
stories
a
cracker
of
jokes
naturally
enough
he
was
heavily
in
debt
but
carried
the
burden
of
it
with
perfect
nonchalance
the
year
before
behrman
had
held
mortgages
for
fully
a
third
of
his
crop
and
had
squeezed
him
viciously
for
interest
but
for
all
that
osterman
and
behrman
were
continually
seen
on
the
main
street
of
bonneville
osterman
was
accustomed
to
slap
behrman
on
his
fat
back
declaring
you
a
good
fellow
old
after
all
hey
as
osterman
entered
from
the
porch
after
hanging
his
cavalry
poncho
and
dripping
hat
on
the
rack
outside
derrick
appeared
in
the
door
that
opened
from
the
into
the
hallway
just
beyond
osterman
saluted
her
with
effusive
cordiality
and
with
ingratiating
blandness
i
am
not
going
to
stay
she
explained
smiling
pleasantly
at
the
group
of
men
her
pretty
brown
eyes
with
their
look
of
inquiry
and
innocence
glancing
from
face
to
face
i
only
came
to
see
if
you
wanted
anything
and
to
say
how
do
you
she
began
talking
to
old
broderson
making
inquiries
as
to
his
wife
who
had
been
sick
the
last
week
and
osterman
turned
to
the
company
shaking
hands
all
around
keeping
up
an
incessant
stream
of
conversation
hello
boys
and
girls
hello
governor
sort
of
a
gathering
of
the
clans
well
if
here
is
that
man
annixter
hello
buck
what
do
you
know
kind
of
dusty
out
at
once
annixter
began
to
get
red
in
the
face
retiring
towards
a
corner
of
the
room
standing
in
an
awkward
position
by
the
case
of
stuffed
birds
shambling
and
confused
while
derrick
was
present
standing
rigidly
on
both
feet
his
elbows
close
to
his
sides
but
he
was
angry
with
osterman
muttering
imprecations
to
himself
horribly
vexed
that
the
young
fellow
should
call
him
buck
before
magnus
wife
this
goat
osterman
had
he
any
sense
that
fool
could
he
ever
learn
how
to
behave
before
a
feemale
calling
him
buck
like
that
while
derrick
was
there
why
a
would
know
better
a
hired
man
would
have
better
manners
all
through
the
dinner
that
followed
annixter
was
out
of
sorts
sulking
in
his
place
refusing
to
eat
by
way
of
vindicating
his
resolving
to
bring
osterman
up
with
a
sharp
turn
if
he
called
him
buck
again
the
chinaman
had
made
a
certain
kind
of
plum
pudding
for
dessert
and
annixter
who
remembered
other
dinners
at
the
derrick
had
been
saving
himself
for
this
and
had
meditated
upon
it
all
through
the
meal
no
doubt
it
would
restore
all
his
good
humour
and
he
believed
his
stomach
was
so
far
recovered
as
to
be
able
to
stand
it
but
unfortunately
the
pudding
was
served
with
a
sauce
that
he
abhorred
a
thick
colourless
mixture
made
from
plain
water
and
sugar
before
he
could
interfere
the
chinaman
had
poured
a
quantity
of
it
upon
his
plate
faugh
exclaimed
annixter
it
makes
me
sick
such
such
sloop
take
it
away
i
have
mine
straight
if
you
do
that
good
for
your
stomach
buck
observed
young
osterman
makes
it
go
down
kind
of
sort
of
slick
do
you
see
sloop
hey
that
a
good
look
here
do
you
call
me
buck
you
do
seem
to
have
any
sense
and
besides
it
is
good
for
my
stomach
i
know
better
what
do
you
know
about
my
stomach
anyhow
just
looking
at
sloop
like
that
makes
me
a
little
while
after
this
the
chinaman
cleared
away
the
dessert
and
brought
in
coffee
and
cigars
the
whiskey
bottle
and
the
syphon
of
reappeared
the
men
eased
themselves
in
their
places
pushing
back
from
the
table
lighting
their
cigars
talking
of
the
beginning
of
the
rains
and
the
prospects
of
a
rise
in
wheat
broderson
began
an
elaborate
mental
calculation
trying
to
settle
in
his
mind
the
exact
date
of
his
visit
to
ukiah
and
osterman
did
tricks
with
bread
pills
but
princess
nathalie
the
cat
was
uneasy
annixter
was
occupying
her
own
particular
chair
in
which
she
slept
every
night
she
could
not
go
to
sleep
but
spied
upon
him
continually
watching
his
every
movement
with
her
lambent
yellow
eyes
clear
as
amber
then
at
length
magnus
who
was
at
the
head
of
the
table
moved
in
his
place
assuming
a
certain
magisterial
attitude
well
gentlemen
he
observed
i
have
lost
my
case
against
the
railroad
the
case
ulsteen
decided
against
me
and
now
i
hear
rumours
to
the
effect
that
rates
for
the
hauling
of
grain
are
to
be
when
magnus
had
finished
there
was
a
moment
silence
each
member
of
the
group
maintaining
his
attitude
of
attention
and
interest
it
was
harran
who
first
spoke
s
behrman
manipulated
the
whole
affair
there
a
big
deal
of
some
kind
in
the
air
and
if
there
is
we
all
know
who
is
back
of
it
behrman
of
course
but
who
back
of
him
it
shelgrim
the
name
fell
squarely
in
the
midst
of
the
conversation
abrupt
grave
sombre
big
with
suggestion
pregnant
with
huge
associations
no
one
in
the
group
who
was
not
familiar
with
it
no
one
for
that
matter
in
the
county
the
state
the
whole
reach
of
the
west
the
entire
union
that
did
not
entertain
convictions
as
to
the
man
who
carried
it
a
giant
figure
in
the
finance
a
product
of
circumstance
an
inevitable
result
of
conditions
characteristic
typical
symbolic
of
ungovernable
forces
in
the
new
movement
the
new
finance
the
reorganisation
of
capital
the
amalgamation
of
powers
the
consolidation
of
enormous
enterprises
no
one
individual
was
more
constantly
in
the
eye
of
the
world
no
one
was
more
hated
more
dreaded
no
one
more
compelling
of
unwilling
tribute
to
his
commanding
genius
to
the
colossal
intellect
operating
the
width
of
an
entire
continent
than
the
president
and
owner
of
the
pacific
and
southwestern
i
do
think
however
he
has
moved
yet
said
magnus
the
thing
for
us
then
exclaimed
osterman
is
to
stand
from
under
before
he
moved
yet
snorted
annixter
he
probably
moved
so
long
ago
that
we
never
noticed
in
any
case
hazarded
magnus
it
is
scarcely
probable
that
the
deal
whatever
it
is
to
be
has
been
consummated
if
we
act
quickly
there
may
be
a
act
quickly
how
demanded
annixter
good
lord
what
can
you
do
we
cinched
already
it
all
amounts
to
just
this
you
ca
buck
against
the
railroad
we
tried
it
and
tried
it
and
we
are
stuck
every
time
you
yourself
derrick
have
just
lost
your
case
behrman
did
you
up
shelgrim
owns
the
courts
he
got
men
like
ulsteen
in
his
pocket
he
got
the
railroad
commission
in
his
pocket
he
got
the
governor
of
the
state
in
his
pocket
he
keeps
a
lobby
at
sacramento
every
minute
of
the
time
the
legislature
is
in
session
he
got
his
own
men
on
the
floor
of
the
united
states
senate
he
has
the
whole
thing
organised
like
an
army
corps
what
are
you
going
to
do
he
sits
in
his
office
in
san
francisco
and
pulls
the
strings
and
we
got
to
but
well
but
hazarded
broderson
but
there
the
interstate
commerce
commission
at
least
on
rates
they
hoh
yes
the
interstate
commerce
commission
shouted
annixter
scornfully
that
great
ai
it
the
greatest
punch
and
judy
show
on
earth
it
almost
as
good
as
the
railroad
commission
there
never
was
and
there
never
will
be
a
california
railroad
commission
not
in
the
pay
of
the
and
it
is
to
the
railroad
commission
nevertheless
remarked
magnus
that
the
people
of
the
state
must
look
for
relief
that
is
our
only
hope
once
elect
commissioners
who
would
be
loyal
to
the
people
and
the
whole
system
of
excessive
rates
falls
to
the
well
why
not
have
a
railroad
commission
of
our
own
then
suddenly
declared
young
osterman
because
it
ca
be
done
retorted
annixter
you
ca
buck
against
the
railroad
and
if
you
could
you
ca
organise
the
farmers
in
the
san
joaquin
we
tried
it
once
and
it
was
enough
to
turn
your
stomach
the
railroad
quietly
bought
delegates
through
behrman
and
did
us
well
that
the
game
to
play
said
osterman
decisively
buy
it
the
only
game
that
seems
to
win
admitted
harran
gloomily
or
ever
will
win
exclaimed
osterman
a
sudden
excitement
seeming
to
take
possession
of
him
his
face
the
face
of
a
comic
actor
with
its
great
slit
of
mouth
and
stiff
red
ears
went
abruptly
pink
look
here
he
cried
this
thing
is
getting
desperate
we
fought
and
fought
in
the
courts
and
out
and
we
tried
agitation
and
and
all
the
rest
of
it
and
behrman
sacks
us
every
time
now
comes
the
time
when
there
a
prospect
of
a
big
crop
we
had
no
rain
for
two
years
and
the
land
has
had
a
long
rest
if
there
is
any
rain
at
all
this
winter
we
have
a
bonanza
year
and
just
at
this
very
moment
when
we
got
our
chance
a
chance
to
pay
off
our
mortgages
and
get
clear
of
debt
and
make
a
strike
here
is
shelgrim
making
a
deal
to
cinch
us
and
put
up
rates
and
now
here
the
primaries
coming
off
and
a
new
railroad
commission
going
in
that
why
shelgrim
chose
this
time
to
make
his
deal
if
we
wait
till
shelgrim
pulls
it
off
we
done
for
flat
i
tell
you
we
in
a
fix
if
we
do
keep
an
eye
open
things
are
getting
desperate
magnus
has
just
said
that
the
key
to
the
whole
thing
is
the
railroad
commission
well
why
not
have
a
commission
of
our
own
never
mind
how
we
get
it
let
get
it
if
it
got
to
be
bought
buy
it
and
put
our
own
men
on
it
and
dictate
what
the
rates
will
be
suppose
it
costs
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
well
we
get
back
more
than
that
in
cheap
mr
osterman
said
magnus
fixing
the
young
man
with
a
swift
glance
mr
osterman
you
are
proposing
a
scheme
of
bribery
i
am
proposing
repeated
osterman
a
scheme
of
bribery
exactly
and
a
crazy
scheme
at
that
said
annixter
gruffly
even
supposing
you
bought
a
railroad
commission
and
got
your
schedule
of
low
rates
what
happens
the
and
crowd
get
out
an
injunction
and
tie
you
they
would
tie
themselves
up
too
hauling
at
low
rates
is
better
than
no
hauling
at
all
the
wheat
has
got
to
be
oh
rot
cried
annixter
are
you
ever
going
to
learn
any
sense
do
you
know
that
cheap
transportation
would
benefit
the
liverpool
buyers
and
not
us
ca
it
be
fed
into
you
that
you
ca
buck
against
the
railroad
when
you
try
to
buy
a
board
of
commissioners
do
you
see
that
you
have
to
bid
against
the
railroad
bid
against
a
corporation
that
can
chuck
out
millions
to
our
thousands
do
you
think
you
can
bid
against
the
and
the
railroad
do
need
to
know
we
are
in
the
game
against
them
till
we
got
our
men
and
when
you
got
them
seated
what
to
prevent
the
corporation
buying
them
right
over
your
head
if
we
got
the
right
kind
of
men
in
they
could
not
be
bought
that
way
interposed
harran
i
do
know
but
what
there
something
in
what
osterman
says
we
have
the
naming
of
the
commission
and
we
name
honest
annixter
struck
the
table
with
his
fist
in
exasperation
honest
men
he
shouted
the
kind
of
men
you
could
get
to
go
into
such
a
scheme
would
have
to
be
to
begin
broderson
shifting
uneasily
in
his
place
fingering
his
beard
with
a
vague
uncertain
gesture
spoke
again
it
would
be
the
chance
of
them
our
commissioners
selling
out
against
the
certainty
of
shelgrim
doing
us
up
that
is
he
hastened
to
add
almost
a
certainty
pretty
near
a
of
course
it
would
be
a
chance
exclaimed
osterman
but
it
come
to
the
point
where
we
got
to
take
chances
risk
a
big
stake
to
make
a
big
strike
and
risk
is
better
than
sure
i
can
be
no
party
to
a
scheme
of
avowed
bribery
and
corruption
osterman
declared
magnus
a
ring
of
severity
in
his
voice
i
am
surprised
sir
that
you
should
even
broach
the
subject
in
my
and
cried
annixter
it
ca
be
i
do
know
muttered
harran
maybe
it
just
wants
a
little
spark
like
this
to
fire
the
whole
magnus
glanced
at
his
son
in
considerable
surprise
he
had
not
expected
this
of
harran
but
so
great
was
his
affection
for
his
son
so
accustomed
had
he
become
to
listening
to
his
advice
to
respecting
his
opinions
that
for
the
moment
after
the
first
shock
of
surprise
and
disappointment
he
was
influenced
to
give
a
certain
degree
of
attention
to
this
new
proposition
he
in
no
way
countenanced
it
at
any
moment
he
was
prepared
to
rise
in
his
place
and
denounce
it
and
osterman
both
it
was
trickery
of
the
most
contemptible
order
a
thing
he
believed
to
be
unknown
to
the
old
school
of
politics
and
statesmanship
to
which
he
was
proud
to
belong
but
since
harran
even
for
one
moment
considered
it
he
magnus
who
trusted
harran
implicitly
would
do
likewise
if
it
was
only
to
oppose
and
defeat
it
in
its
very
beginnings
and
abruptly
the
discussion
began
gradually
osterman
by
dint
of
his
clamour
his
strident
reiteration
the
plausibility
of
his
glib
ready
assertions
the
ease
with
which
he
extricated
himself
when
apparently
driven
to
a
corner
completely
won
over
old
broderson
to
his
way
of
thinking
osterman
bewildered
him
with
his
volubility
the
lightning
rapidity
with
which
he
leaped
from
one
subject
to
another
garrulous
witty
flamboyant
terrifying
the
old
man
with
pictures
of
the
swift
approach
of
ruin
the
imminence
of
danger
annixter
who
led
the
argument
against
him
loving
argument
though
he
did
appeared
to
poor
advantage
unable
to
present
his
side
effectively
he
called
osterman
a
fool
a
goat
a
senseless
jackass
but
was
unable
to
refute
his
assertions
his
debate
was
the
clumsy
heaving
of
brickbats
brutal
direct
he
contradicted
everything
osterman
said
as
a
matter
of
principle
made
conflicting
assertions
declarations
that
were
absolutely
inconsistent
and
when
osterman
or
harran
used
these
against
him
could
only
exclaim
well
in
a
way
it
so
and
then
again
in
a
way
it
but
suddenly
osterman
discovered
a
new
argument
if
we
swing
this
deal
he
cried
we
got
old
behrman
right
where
we
want
he
the
man
that
does
us
every
time
cried
harran
if
there
is
dirty
work
to
be
done
in
which
the
railroad
does
wish
to
appear
it
is
behrman
who
does
it
if
the
freight
rates
are
to
be
to
squeeze
us
a
little
harder
it
is
behrman
who
regulates
what
we
can
stand
if
there
a
judge
to
be
bought
it
is
behrman
who
does
the
bargaining
if
there
is
a
jury
to
be
bribed
it
is
behrman
who
handles
the
money
if
there
is
an
election
to
be
jobbed
it
is
behrman
who
manipulates
it
it
behrman
here
and
behrman
there
it
is
behrman
we
come
against
every
time
we
make
a
move
it
is
behrman
who
has
the
grip
of
us
and
will
never
let
go
till
he
has
squeezed
us
bone
dry
why
when
i
think
of
it
all
sometimes
i
wonder
i
keep
my
hands
off
the
osterman
got
on
his
feet
leaning
across
the
table
gesturing
wildly
with
his
right
hand
his
face
with
its
bald
forehead
and
stiff
red
ears
was
inflamed
with
excitement
he
took
the
floor
creating
an
impression
attracting
all
attention
to
himself
playing
to
the
gallery
gesticulating
clamourous
full
of
noise
well
now
is
your
chance
to
get
even
he
vociferated
it
is
now
or
never
you
can
take
it
and
save
the
situation
for
yourselves
and
all
california
or
you
can
leave
it
and
rot
on
your
own
ranches
buck
i
know
you
i
know
you
not
afraid
of
anything
that
wears
skin
i
know
got
sand
all
through
you
and
i
know
if
i
showed
you
how
we
could
put
our
deal
through
and
seat
a
commission
of
our
own
you
would
hang
back
governor
you
a
brave
man
you
know
the
advantage
of
prompt
and
fearless
action
you
are
not
the
sort
to
shrink
from
taking
chances
to
play
for
big
stakes
is
just
your
game
to
stake
a
fortune
on
the
turn
of
a
card
you
did
get
the
reputation
of
being
the
strongest
poker
player
in
el
dorado
county
for
nothing
now
here
the
biggest
gamble
that
ever
came
your
way
if
we
stand
up
to
it
like
men
with
guts
in
us
we
win
out
if
we
hesitate
we
i
do
suppose
you
can
help
playing
the
goat
osterman
remarked
annixter
but
what
your
idea
what
do
you
think
we
can
do
i
not
saying
he
hastened
to
interpose
that
you
anyways
convinced
me
by
all
this
cackling
i
know
as
well
as
you
that
we
are
in
a
hole
but
i
knew
that
before
i
came
here
you
not
done
anything
to
make
me
change
my
mind
but
just
what
do
you
propose
let
hear
well
i
say
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
see
disbrow
he
the
political
boss
of
the
denver
pueblo
and
mojave
road
we
will
have
to
get
in
with
the
machine
some
way
and
that
particularly
why
i
want
magnus
with
us
he
knows
politics
better
than
any
of
us
and
if
we
do
want
to
get
sold
again
we
will
have
to
have
some
one
that
in
the
know
to
steer
the
only
politics
i
understand
osterman
answered
magnus
sternly
are
honest
politics
you
must
look
elsewhere
for
your
political
manager
i
refuse
to
have
any
part
in
this
matter
if
the
railroad
commission
can
be
nominated
legitimately
if
your
arrangements
can
be
made
without
bribery
i
am
with
you
to
the
last
iota
of
my
well
you
ca
get
what
you
want
without
paying
for
it
contradicted
annixter
broderson
was
about
to
speak
when
osterman
kicked
his
foot
under
the
table
he
himself
held
his
peace
he
was
quick
to
see
that
if
he
could
involve
magnus
and
annixter
in
an
argument
annixter
for
the
mere
love
of
contention
would
oppose
the
governor
and
without
knowing
it
would
commit
himself
to
his
osterman
scheme
this
was
precisely
what
happened
in
a
few
moments
annixter
was
declaring
at
top
voice
his
readiness
to
mortgage
the
crop
of
quien
sabe
if
necessary
for
the
sake
of
busting
he
could
see
no
great
obstacle
in
the
way
of
controlling
the
nominating
convention
so
far
as
securing
the
naming
of
two
railroad
commissioners
was
concerned
two
was
all
they
needed
probably
it
would
cost
money
you
did
get
something
for
nothing
it
would
cost
them
all
a
good
deal
more
if
they
sat
like
lumps
on
a
log
and
played
while
shelgrim
sold
out
from
under
them
then
there
was
this
too
the
and
were
hard
up
just
then
the
shortage
on
the
state
wheat
crop
for
the
last
two
years
had
affected
them
too
they
were
retrenching
in
expenditures
all
along
the
line
had
they
just
cut
wages
in
all
departments
there
was
this
affair
of
dyke
to
prove
it
the
railroad
did
always
act
as
a
unit
either
there
was
always
a
party
in
it
that
opposed
spending
too
much
money
he
would
bet
that
party
was
strong
just
now
he
was
kind
of
sick
himself
of
being
kicked
by
behrman
had
that
pip
turned
up
on
his
ranch
that
very
day
to
bully
him
about
his
own
line
fence
next
he
would
be
telling
him
what
kind
of
clothes
he
ought
to
wear
harran
had
the
right
idea
somebody
had
got
to
be
busted
mighty
soon
now
and
he
did
propose
that
it
should
be
he
now
you
are
talking
something
like
sense
observed
osterman
i
thought
you
would
see
it
like
that
when
you
got
my
your
idea
your
idea
cried
annixter
why
i
had
this
idea
myself
for
over
three
what
about
disbrow
asked
harran
hastening
to
interrupt
why
do
we
want
to
see
disbrow
disbrow
is
the
political
man
for
the
denver
pueblo
and
mojave
answered
osterman
and
you
see
it
like
this
the
mojave
road
run
up
into
the
valley
at
all
their
terminus
is
way
to
the
south
of
us
and
they
do
care
anything
about
grain
rates
through
the
san
joaquin
they
do
care
how
the
commission
is
because
the
commission
rulings
ca
affect
them
but
they
divide
traffic
with
the
and
in
the
southern
part
of
the
state
and
they
have
a
good
deal
of
influence
with
that
road
i
want
to
get
the
mojave
road
through
disbrow
to
recommend
a
commissioner
of
our
choosing
to
the
and
and
have
the
and
adopt
him
as
their
who
for
instance
darrell
that
los
angeles
man
remember
well
darrell
is
no
particular
friend
of
disbrow
said
annixter
why
should
disbrow
take
him
up
cried
osterman
we
make
it
worth
disbrow
while
to
do
it
we
go
to
him
and
say
disbrow
you
manage
the
politics
for
the
mojave
railroad
and
what
you
say
goes
with
your
board
of
directors
we
want
you
to
adopt
our
candidate
for
railroad
commissioner
for
the
third
district
how
much
do
you
want
for
doing
it
i
know
we
can
buy
disbrow
that
gives
us
one
commissioner
we
need
not
bother
about
that
any
more
in
the
first
district
we
do
make
any
move
at
all
we
let
the
political
managers
of
the
and
nominate
whoever
they
like
then
we
concentrate
all
our
efforts
to
putting
in
our
man
in
the
second
district
there
is
where
the
big
fight
will
i
see
perfectly
well
what
you
mean
osterman
observed
magnus
but
make
no
mistake
sir
as
to
my
attitude
in
this
business
you
may
count
me
as
out
of
it
well
suppose
we
win
put
in
annixter
truculently
already
acknowledging
himself
as
involved
in
the
proposed
undertaking
suppose
we
win
and
get
low
rates
for
hauling
grain
how
about
you
then
you
count
yourself
in
then
do
you
you
get
all
the
benefit
of
lower
rates
without
sharing
any
of
the
risks
we
take
to
secure
them
no
nor
any
of
the
expense
either
no
you
wo
dirty
your
fingers
with
helping
us
put
this
deal
through
but
you
wo
be
so
cursed
particular
when
it
comes
to
sharing
the
profits
will
you
magnus
rose
abruptly
to
his
full
height
the
nostrils
of
his
thin
nose
vibrating
his
face
paler
than
ever
stop
right
where
you
are
sir
he
exclaimed
you
forget
yourself
annixter
please
understand
that
i
tolerate
such
words
as
you
have
permitted
yourself
to
make
use
of
from
no
man
not
even
from
my
guest
i
shall
ask
you
to
in
an
instant
he
dominated
the
entire
group
imposing
a
respect
that
was
as
much
fear
as
admiration
no
one
made
response
for
the
moment
he
was
the
master
again
the
leader
like
so
many
delinquent
the
others
cowered
before
him
ashamed
put
to
confusion
unable
to
find
their
tongues
in
that
brief
instant
of
silence
following
upon
outburst
and
while
he
held
them
subdued
and
the
fabric
of
their
scheme
of
corruption
and
dishonesty
trembled
to
its
base
it
was
the
last
protest
of
the
old
school
rising
up
there
in
denunciation
of
the
new
order
of
things
the
statesman
opposed
to
the
politician
honesty
rectitude
uncompromising
integrity
prevailing
for
the
last
time
against
the
devious
manoeuvring
the
evil
communications
the
rotten
expediency
of
a
corrupted
institution
for
a
few
seconds
no
one
answered
then
annixter
moving
abruptly
and
uneasily
in
his
place
muttered
i
spoke
upon
provocation
if
you
like
we
consider
it
unsaid
i
do
know
what
going
to
become
of
us
go
out
of
business
i
i
understand
magnus
all
right
put
in
osterman
he
do
have
to
go
into
this
thing
if
it
against
his
conscience
that
all
right
magnus
can
stay
out
if
he
wants
to
but
that
wo
prevent
us
going
ahead
and
seeing
what
we
can
do
only
there
this
about
he
turned
again
to
magnus
speaking
with
every
degree
of
earnestness
every
appearance
of
conviction
i
did
not
deny
governor
from
the
very
start
that
this
would
mean
bribery
but
you
do
suppose
that
i
like
the
idea
either
if
there
was
one
legitimate
hope
that
was
yet
left
untried
no
matter
how
forlorn
it
was
i
would
try
it
but
there
not
it
is
literally
and
soberly
true
that
every
means
of
help
every
honest
means
has
been
attempted
shelgrim
is
going
to
cinch
us
grain
rates
are
increasing
while
on
the
other
hand
the
price
of
wheat
is
sagging
lower
and
lower
all
the
time
if
we
do
do
something
we
are
osterman
paused
for
a
moment
allowing
precisely
the
right
number
of
seconds
to
elapse
then
altering
and
lowering
his
voice
added
i
respect
the
governor
principles
i
admire
them
they
do
him
every
degree
of
then
turning
directly
to
magnus
he
concluded
with
but
i
only
want
you
to
ask
yourself
sir
if
at
such
a
crisis
one
ought
to
think
of
oneself
to
consider
purely
personal
motives
in
such
a
desperate
situation
as
this
now
we
want
you
with
us
governor
perhaps
not
openly
if
you
do
wish
it
but
tacitly
at
least
i
wo
ask
you
for
an
answer
but
what
i
do
ask
of
you
is
to
consider
this
matter
seriously
and
think
over
the
whole
business
will
you
do
it
osterman
ceased
definitely
to
speak
leaning
forward
across
the
table
his
eyes
fixed
on
magnus
face
there
was
a
silence
outside
the
rain
fell
continually
with
an
even
monotonous
murmur
in
the
group
of
men
around
the
table
no
one
stirred
nor
spoke
they
looked
steadily
at
magnus
who
for
the
moment
kept
his
glance
fixed
thoughtfully
upon
the
table
before
him
in
another
moment
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
from
face
to
face
around
the
group
after
all
these
were
his
neighbours
his
friends
men
with
whom
he
had
been
upon
the
closest
terms
of
association
in
a
way
they
represented
what
now
had
come
to
be
his
world
his
single
swift
glance
took
in
the
men
one
after
another
annixter
rugged
crude
sitting
awkwardly
and
uncomfortably
in
his
chair
his
unhandsome
face
with
its
outthrust
lower
lip
and
deeply
cleft
masculine
chin
flushed
and
eager
his
yellow
hair
disordered
the
one
tuft
on
the
crown
standing
stiffly
forth
like
the
feather
in
an
indian
scalp
lock
broderson
vaguely
combing
at
his
long
beard
with
a
persistent
maniacal
gesture
distressed
troubled
and
uneasy
osterman
with
his
comedy
face
the
face
of
a
singer
his
head
bald
and
set
off
by
his
great
red
ears
leaning
back
in
his
place
softly
cracking
the
knuckle
of
a
forefinger
and
last
of
all
and
close
to
his
elbow
his
son
his
support
his
confidant
and
companion
harran
so
like
himself
with
his
own
erect
fine
carriage
his
thin
nose
and
his
blond
hair
with
its
tendency
to
curl
in
a
forward
direction
in
front
of
the
ears
young
strong
courageous
full
of
the
promise
of
the
future
years
his
blue
eyes
looked
straight
into
his
father
with
what
magnus
could
fancy
a
glance
of
appeal
magnus
could
see
that
expression
in
the
faces
of
the
others
very
plainly
they
looked
to
him
as
their
natural
leader
their
chief
who
was
to
bring
them
out
from
this
abominable
trouble
which
was
closing
in
upon
them
and
in
them
all
he
saw
many
types
they
these
men
around
his
table
on
that
night
of
the
first
rain
of
a
coming
season
seemed
to
stand
in
his
imagination
for
many
others
all
the
farmers
ranchers
and
wheat
growers
of
the
great
san
joaquin
their
words
were
the
words
of
a
whole
community
their
distress
the
distress
of
an
entire
state
harried
beyond
the
bounds
of
endurance
driven
to
the
wall
coerced
exploited
harassed
to
the
limits
of
exasperation
i
will
think
of
it
he
said
then
hastened
to
add
but
i
can
tell
you
beforehand
that
you
may
expect
only
a
after
magnus
had
spoken
there
was
a
prolonged
silence
the
conference
seemed
of
itself
to
have
come
to
an
end
for
that
evening
presley
lighted
another
cigarette
from
the
butt
of
the
one
he
had
been
smoking
and
the
cat
princess
nathalie
disturbed
by
his
movement
and
by
a
whiff
of
drifting
smoke
jumped
from
his
knee
to
the
floor
and
picking
her
way
across
the
room
to
annixter
rubbed
gently
against
his
legs
her
tail
in
the
air
her
back
delicately
arched
no
doubt
she
thought
it
time
to
settle
herself
for
the
night
and
as
annixter
gave
no
indication
of
vacating
his
chair
she
chose
this
way
of
cajoling
him
into
ceding
his
place
to
her
but
annixter
was
irritated
at
the
princess
attentions
misunderstanding
their
motive
get
out
he
exclaimed
lifting
his
feet
to
the
rung
of
the
chair
lord
love
me
but
i
sure
do
hate
a
by
the
way
observed
osterman
i
passed
genslinger
by
the
gate
as
i
came
in
had
he
been
here
yes
he
was
here
said
harran
and
but
annixter
took
the
words
out
of
his
mouth
he
says
there
some
talk
of
the
railroad
selling
us
their
sections
this
oh
he
did
did
he
exclaimed
osterman
interested
at
once
where
did
he
hear
that
where
does
a
railroad
paper
get
its
news
from
the
general
office
i
i
hope
he
did
get
it
straight
from
headquarters
that
the
land
was
to
be
graded
at
twenty
dollars
an
acre
murmured
broderson
what
that
demanded
osterman
twenty
dollars
here
put
me
on
somebody
what
all
up
what
did
genslinger
say
oh
you
need
get
scared
said
annixter
genslinger
do
know
that
all
he
thinks
there
was
no
understanding
that
the
price
of
the
land
should
not
be
advanced
when
the
and
came
to
sell
to
oh
muttered
osterman
relieved
magnus
who
had
gone
out
into
the
office
on
the
other
side
of
the
hallway
returned
with
a
long
yellow
envelope
in
his
hand
stuffed
with
newspaper
clippings
and
thin
closely
printed
pamphlets
here
is
the
circular
he
remarked
drawing
out
one
of
the
pamphlets
the
conditions
of
settlement
to
which
the
railroad
obligated
itself
are
very
he
ran
over
the
pages
of
the
circular
then
read
aloud
company
invites
settlers
to
go
upon
its
lands
before
patents
are
issued
or
the
road
is
completed
and
intends
in
such
cases
to
sell
to
them
in
preference
to
any
other
applicants
and
at
a
price
based
upon
the
value
of
the
land
without
improvements
and
on
the
other
page
here
he
remarked
they
refer
to
this
again
ascertaining
the
value
of
the
lands
any
improvements
that
a
settler
or
any
other
person
may
have
on
the
lands
will
not
be
taken
into
consideration
neither
will
the
price
be
increased
in
consequence
thereof
settlers
are
thus
insured
that
in
addition
to
being
accorded
the
first
privilege
of
purchase
at
the
graded
price
they
will
also
be
protected
in
their
improvements
and
here
he
commented
in
section
ix
it
reads
lands
are
not
uniform
in
price
but
are
offered
at
various
figures
from
upward
per
acre
usually
land
covered
with
tall
timber
is
held
at
per
acre
and
that
with
pine
at
most
is
for
sale
at
and
when
you
come
to
read
that
carefully
hazarded
old
broderson
it
it
not
so
very
reassuring
is
for
sale
at
an
acre
it
says
that
do
mean
that
only
means
some
i
wish
now
that
i
had
secured
a
more
agreement
from
the
and
when
i
took
up
its
sections
on
my
ranch
and
and
genslinger
is
in
a
position
to
know
the
intentions
of
the
railroad
at
least
he
he
he
is
in
touch
with
them
all
newspaper
men
are
those
i
mean
who
are
subsidised
by
the
general
office
but
perhaps
genslinger
is
subsidised
i
know
i
i
am
not
sure
maybe
perhaps
oh
you
do
know
and
you
do
know
and
maybe
and
perhaps
and
not
so
sure
vociferated
annixter
how
about
ignoring
the
value
of
our
improvements
nothing
hazy
about
that
statement
i
guess
it
says
in
so
many
words
that
any
improvements
we
make
will
not
be
considered
when
the
land
is
appraised
and
that
the
same
thing
is
it
the
unimproved
land
is
worth
an
acre
only
timber
land
is
worth
more
and
there
none
too
much
timber
about
well
one
thing
at
a
time
said
harran
the
thing
for
us
now
is
to
get
into
this
primary
election
and
the
convention
and
see
if
we
can
push
our
men
for
railroad
right
declared
annixter
he
rose
stretching
his
arms
above
his
head
i
about
talked
all
the
wind
out
of
me
he
said
think
i
be
moving
along
it
pretty
near
but
when
magnus
guests
turned
their
attention
to
the
matter
of
returning
to
their
different
ranches
they
abruptly
realised
that
the
downpour
had
doubled
and
trebled
in
its
volume
since
earlier
in
the
evening
the
fields
and
roads
were
veritable
seas
of
viscid
mud
the
night
absolutely
assuredly
not
a
night
in
which
to
venture
out
magnus
insisted
that
the
three
ranchers
should
put
up
at
los
muertos
osterman
accepted
at
once
annixter
after
an
interminable
discussion
allowed
himself
to
be
persuaded
in
the
end
accepting
as
though
granting
a
favour
broderson
protested
that
his
wife
who
was
not
well
would
expect
him
to
return
that
night
and
would
no
doubt
fret
if
he
did
not
appear
furthermore
he
lived
close
by
at
the
junction
of
the
county
and
lower
road
he
put
a
sack
over
his
head
and
shoulders
persistently
declining
magnus
offered
umbrella
and
rubber
coat
and
hurried
away
remarking
that
he
had
no
foreman
on
his
ranch
and
had
to
be
up
and
about
at
five
the
next
morning
to
put
his
men
to
work
fool
muttered
annixter
when
the
old
man
had
gone
imagine
farming
a
ranch
the
size
of
his
without
a
harran
showed
osterman
and
annixter
where
they
were
to
sleep
in
adjoining
rooms
magnus
soon
afterward
retired
osterman
found
an
excuse
for
going
to
bed
but
annixter
and
harran
remained
in
the
latter
room
in
a
haze
of
blue
tobacco
smoke
talking
talking
but
at
length
at
the
end
of
all
argument
annixter
got
up
remarking
well
i
going
to
turn
in
it
nearly
two
he
went
to
his
room
closing
the
door
and
harran
opening
his
window
to
clear
out
the
tobacco
smoke
looked
out
for
a
moment
across
the
country
toward
the
south
the
darkness
was
profound
impenetrable
the
rain
fell
with
an
uninterrupted
roar
near
at
hand
one
could
hear
the
sound
of
dripping
eaves
and
foliage
and
the
eager
sucking
sound
of
the
drinking
earth
and
abruptly
while
harran
stood
looking
out
one
hand
upon
the
upraised
sash
a
great
puff
of
the
outside
air
invaded
the
room
odourous
with
the
reek
of
the
soaking
earth
redolent
with
fertility
pungent
heavy
tepid
he
closed
the
window
again
and
sat
for
a
few
moments
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
one
shoe
in
his
hand
thoughtful
and
absorbed
wondering
if
his
father
would
involve
himself
in
this
new
scheme
wondering
if
after
all
he
wanted
him
to
but
suddenly
he
was
aware
of
a
commotion
issuing
from
the
direction
of
annixter
room
and
the
voice
of
annixter
himself
upraised
in
expostulation
and
exasperation
the
door
of
the
room
to
which
annixter
had
been
assigned
opened
with
a
violent
wrench
and
an
angry
voice
exclaimed
to
anybody
who
would
listen
oh
yes
funny
is
it
in
a
way
it
funny
and
then
again
in
a
way
it
the
door
banged
to
so
that
all
the
windows
of
the
house
rattled
in
their
frames
harran
hurried
out
into
the
and
there
met
presley
and
his
father
who
had
been
aroused
as
well
by
annixter
clamour
osterman
was
there
too
his
bald
head
gleaming
like
a
bulb
of
ivory
in
the
light
of
the
lamp
that
magnus
carried
what
all
up
demanded
osterman
whatever
in
the
world
is
the
matter
with
buck
confused
and
terrible
sounds
came
from
behind
the
door
of
room
a
prolonged
monologue
of
grievance
broken
by
explosions
of
wrath
and
the
vague
noise
of
some
one
in
a
furious
hurry
all
at
once
and
before
harran
had
a
chance
to
knock
on
the
door
annixter
flung
it
open
his
face
was
blazing
with
anger
his
outthrust
lip
more
prominent
than
ever
his
wiry
yellow
hair
in
disarray
the
tuft
on
the
crown
sticking
straight
into
the
air
like
the
upraised
hackles
of
an
angry
hound
evidently
he
had
been
dressing
himself
with
the
most
headlong
rapidity
he
had
not
yet
put
on
his
coat
and
vest
but
carried
them
over
his
arm
while
with
his
disengaged
hand
he
kept
hitching
his
suspenders
over
his
shoulders
with
a
persistent
and
hypnotic
gesture
without
a
pause
he
gave
vent
to
his
indignation
in
a
torrent
of
words
ah
yes
in
my
bed
sloop
aha
i
know
the
man
who
put
it
there
he
went
on
glaring
at
osterman
and
that
man
is
a
pip
sloop
slimy
disgusting
stuff
you
heard
me
say
i
did
like
it
when
the
chink

it
to
me

that
reason

it
in
my
bed
and
i

my
feet

it
when

it
oh

little
louder

protested
harran
as
he
noticed
the
hat
in
hand
you

going
home
just
for
annixter
turned
on
him
with
a
shout
i

plumb
out

here
he
trumpeted
i
wo
stay
here
another
he
swung
into
his
waistcoat
and
coat
scrabbling
at
the
buttons
in
the
violence
of
his
emotions
and
i
do
know
but
what
it
will
make
me
sick
again
to
go
out
in
a
night

a
he
stormed
to
the
door
leading
out
upon
the
porch
deaf
to
all
reason
harran
and
presley
followed
him
trying
to
dissuade
him
from
going
home
at
that
time
of
night
and
in
such
a
storm
but
annixter
was
not
to
be
placated
he
stamped
across
to
the
barn
where
his
horse
and
buggy
had
been
stabled
splashing
through
the
puddles
under
foot
going
out
of
his
way
to
drench
himself
refusing
even
to
allow
presley
and
harran
to
help
him
harness
the
horse
what
the
use
of
making
a
fool
of
yourself
annixter
remonstrated
presley
as
annixter
backed
the
horse
from
the
stall
you
act
just
like
a
boy
if
osterman
wants
to
play
the
goat
why
should
you
help
him
out
he
a
pip
vociferated
annixter
you
do
understand
presley
it
runs
in
my
family
to
hate
anything
sticky
it
it
it
heredity
how
would
you
like
to
get
into
bed
at
two
in
the
morning
and
jam
your
feet
down
into
a
slimy
mess
like
that
oh
no
it
not
so
funny
then
and
you
mark
my
words
harran
derrick
he
continued
as
he
climbed
into
the
buggy
shaking
the
whip
toward
harran
this
business
we
talked
over
i
out
of
it
it
yellow
it
too
cursed
he
cut
the
horse
across
the
back
with
the
whip
and
drove
out
into
the
pelting
rain
in
a
few
seconds
the
sound
of
his
buggy
wheels
was
lost
in
the
muffled
roar
of
the
downpour
harran
and
presley
closed
the
barn
and
returned
to
the
house
sheltering
themselves
under
a
tarpaulin
carriage
cover
once
inside
harran
went
to
remonstrate
with
osterman
who
was
still
up
magnus
had
again
retired
the
house
had
fallen
quiet
again
as
presley
crossed
the
on
the
way
to
his
own
apartment
in
the
second
story
of
the
house
he
paused
for
a
moment
looking
about
him
in
the
dull
light
of
the
lowered
lamps
the
redwood
panelling
of
the
room
showed
a
dark
crimson
as
though
stained
with
blood
on
the
massive
slab
of
the
dining
table
the
glasses
and
bottles
stood
about
in
the
confusion
in
which
they
had
been
left
reflecting
themselves
deep
into
the
polished
wood
the
glass
doors
of
the
case
of
stuffed
birds
was
a
subdued
shimmer
the
navajo
blanket
over
the
couch
seemed
a
mere
patch
of
brown
around
the
table
the
chairs
in
which
the
men
had
sat
throughout
the
evening
still
ranged
themselves
in
a
vaguely
suggestive
of
the
conference
of
the
past
few
hours
with
all
its
possibilities
of
good
and
evil
its
significance
of
a
future
big
with
portent
the
room
was
still
only
on
the
cushions
of
the
chair

annixter
had
occupied
the
cat
princess
nathalie
at
last
comfortably
settled
in
her
accustomed
place
dozed
complacently
her
paws
tucked
under
her
breast
filling
the
deserted
room
with
the
subdued
murmur
of
her
contented
purr
chapter
iv
on
the
quien

ranch
in
one
of
its
western
divisions
near
the
line
fence
that
divided
it
from
the
osterman
holding
vanamee
was
harnessing
the
horses
to
the
plough
to
which
he
had
been
assigned
two
days
before
a
from
the
division
barn
helping
him
promptly
discharged
from
the
employ
of
the
after
the
lamentable
accident
near
the
long
trestle
vanamee
had
presented
himself
to
harran
asking
for
employment
the
season
was
beginning
on
all
the
ranches
work
was
being
resumed
the
rain
had
put
the
ground
into
admirable
condition
for
ploughing
and
annixter
broderson
and
osterman
all
had
their
gangs
at
work
thus
vanamee
was
vastly
surprised
to
find
los
muertos
idle
the
horses
still
in
the
barns
the
men
gathering
in
the
shade
of
the
and
smoking
dozing
or
going
aimlessly
about
their
arms
dangling
the
ploughs
for
which
magnus
and
harran
were
waiting
in
a
fury
of
impatience
had
not
yet
arrived
and
since
the
management
of
los
muertos
had
counted
upon
having
these
in
hand
long
before
this
time
no
provision
had
been
made
for
keeping
the
old
stock
in
repair
many
of
these
old
ploughs
were
useless
broken
and
out
of
order
some
had
been
sold
it
could
not
be
said
definitely
when
the
new
ploughs
would
arrive
harran
had
decided
to
wait
one
week
longer
and
then
in
case
of
their
to
buy
a
consignment
of
the
old
style
of
plough
from
the
dealers
in
bonneville
he
could
afford
to
lose
the
money
better
than
he
could
afford
to
lose
the
season
failing
of
work
on
los
muertos
vanamee
had
gone
to
quien
sabe
annixter
whom
he
had
spoken
to
first
had
sent
him
across
the
ranch
to
one
of
his
division
superintendents
and
this
latter
after
assuring
himself
of
vanamee
familiarity
with
horses
and
his
previous
experience
even
though
somewhat
remote
on
los
muertos
had
taken
him
on
as
a
driver
of
one
of
the
gang
ploughs
then
at
work
on
his
division
the
evening
before
when
the
foreman
had
blown
his
whistle
at
six
the
long
line
of
ploughs
had
halted
upon
the
instant
and
the
drivers
unharnessing
their
teams
had
taken
them
back
to
the
division
barns
leaving
the
ploughs
as
they
were
in
the
furrows
but
an
hour
after
daylight
the
next
morning
the
work
was
resumed
after
breakfast
vanamee
riding
one
horse
and
leading
the
others
had
returned
to
the
line
of
ploughs
together
with
the
other
drivers
now
he
was
busy
harnessing
the
team
at
the
division
blacksmith
shop
temporarily
put
up
he
had
been
obliged
to
wait
while
one
of
his
lead
horses
was
shod
and
he
had
thus
been
delayed
quite
five
minutes
nearly
all
the
other
teams
were
harnessed
the
drivers
on
their
seats
waiting
for
the
foreman
signal
all
ready
here
inquired
the
foreman
driving
up
to
vanamee
team
in
his
buggy
all
ready
sir
answered
vanamee
buckling
the
last
strap
he
climbed
to
his
seat
shaking
out
the
reins
and
turning
about
looked
back
along
the
line
then
all
around
him
at
the
landscape
inundated
with
the
brilliant
glow
of
the
early
morning
the
day
was
fine
since
the
first
rain
of
the
season
there
had
been
no
other
now
the
sky
was
without
a
cloud
pale
blue
delicate
luminous
scintillating
with
morning
the
great
brown
earth
turned
a
huge
flank
to
it
exhaling
the
moisture
of
the
early
dew
the
atmosphere
washed
clean
of
dust
and
mist
was
translucent
as
crystal
far
off
to
the
east
the
hills
on
the
other
side
of
broderson
creek
stood
out
against
the
pallid
saffron
of
the
horizon
as
flat
and
as
sharply
outlined
as
if
pasted
on
the
sky
the
campanile
of
the
ancient
mission
of
san
juan
seemed
as
fine
as
frost
work
all
about
between
the
horizons
the
carpet
of
the
land
unrolled
itself
to
infinity
but
now
it
was
no
longer
parched
with
heat
cracked
and
warped
by
a
merciless
sun
powdered
with
dust
the
rain
had
done
its
work
not
a
clod
that
was
not
swollen
with
fertility
not
a
fissure
that
did
not
exhale
the
sense
of
fecundity
one
could
not
take
a
dozen
steps
upon
the
ranches
without
the
brusque
sensation
that
underfoot
the
land
was
alive
roused
at
last
from
its
sleep
palpitating
with
the
desire
of
reproduction
deep
down
there
in
the
recesses
of
the
soil
the
great
heart
throbbed
once
more
thrilling
with
passion
vibrating
with
desire
offering
itself
to
the
caress
of
the
plough
insistent
eager
imperious
dimly
one
felt
the
trouble
of
the
earth
the
uneasy
agitation
of
its
members
the
hidden
tumult
of
its
womb
demanding
to
be
made
fruitful
to
reproduce
to
disengage
the
eternal
renascent
germ
of
life
that
stirred
and
struggled
in
its
loins
the
ploughs
in
number
each
drawn
by
its
team
of
ten
stretched
in
an
interminable
line
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
length
behind
and
ahead
of
vanamee
they
were
arranged
as
it
were
en
echelon
not
in
file
not
one
directly
behind
the
other
but
each
succeeding
plough
its
own
width
farther
in
the
field
than
the
one
in
front
of
it
each
of
these
ploughs
held
five
shears
so
that
when
the
entire
company
was
in
motion
one
hundred
and
furrows
were
made
at
the
same
instant
at
a
distance
the
ploughs
resembled
a
great
column
of
field
artillery
each
driver
was
in
his
place
his
glance
alternating
between
his
horses
and
the
foreman
nearest
at
hand
other
foremen
in
their
buggies
or
buckboards
were
at
intervals
along
the
line
like
battery
lieutenants
annixter
himself
on
horseback
in
boots
and
campaign
hat
a
cigar
in
his
teeth
overlooked
the
scene
the
division
superintendent
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
line
galloped
past
to
a
position
at
the
head
for
a
long
moment
there
was
a
silence
a
sense
of
preparedness
ran
from
end
to
end
of
the
column
all
things
were
ready
each
man
in
his
place
the
day
work
was
about
to
begin
suddenly
from
a
distance
at
the
head
of
the
line
came
the
shrill
trilling
of
a
whistle
at
once
the
foreman
nearest
vanamee
repeated
it
at
the
same
time
turning
down
the
line
and
waving
one
arm
the
signal
was
repeated
whistle
answering
whistle
till
the
sounds
lost
themselves
in
the
distance
at
once
the
line
of
ploughs
lost
its
immobility
moving
forward
getting
slowly
under
way
the
horses
straining
in
the
traces
a
prolonged
movement
rippled
from
team
to
team
disengaging
in
its
passage
a
multitude
of
sounds
click
of
buckles
the
creak
of
straining
leather
the
subdued
clash
of
machinery
the
cracking
of
whips
the
deep
breathing
of
nearly
four
hundred
horses
the
abrupt
commands
and
cries
of
the
drivers
and
last
of
all
the
prolonged
soothing
murmur
of
the
thick
brown
earth
turning
steadily
from
the
multitude
of
advancing
shears
the
ploughing
thus
commenced
continued
the
sun
rose
higher
steadily
the
hundred
iron
hands
kneaded
and
furrowed
and
stroked
the
brown
humid
earth
the
hundred
iron
teeth
bit
deep
into
the
titan
flesh
perched
on
his
seat
the
moist
living
reins
slipping
and
tugging
in
his
hands
vanamee
in
the
midst
of
this
steady
confusion
of
constantly
varying
sensation
sight
interrupted
by
sound
sound
mingling
with
sight
on
this
swaying
vibrating
seat
quivering
with
the
prolonged
thrill
of
the
earth
lapsed
to
a
sort
of
pleasing
numbness
in
a
sense
hypnotised
by
the
weaving
maze
of
things
in
which
he
found
himself
involved
to
keep
his
team
at
an
even
regular
gait
maintaining
the
precise
interval
to
run
his
furrows
as
closely
as
possible
to
those
already
made
by
the
plough
in
front
this
for
the
moment
was
the
entire
sum
of
his
duties
but
while
one
part
of
his
brain
alert
and
watchful
took
cognisance
of
these
matters
all
the
greater
part
was
lulled
and
stupefied
with
the
long
monotony
of
the
affair
the
ploughing
now
in
full
swing
enveloped
him
in
a
vague
whirl
of
things
underneath
him
was
the
jarring
jolting
trembling
machine
not
a
clod
was
turned
not
an
obstacle
encountered
that
he
did
not
receive
the
swift
impression
of
it
through
all
his
body
the
very
friction
of
the
damp
soil
sliding
incessantly
from
the
shiny
surface
of
the
shears
seemed
to
reproduce
itself
in
his
and
along
the
back
of
his
head
he
heard
the
by
the
myriads
crushing
down
easily
deeply
into
the
loam
the
prolonged
clinking
of
the
working
of
the
smooth
brown
flanks
in
the
harness
the
clatter
of
wooden
hames
the
champing
of
bits
the
click
of
iron
shoes
against
pebbles
the
brittle
stubble
of
the
surface
ground
crackling
and
snapping
as
the
furrows
turned
the
sonorous
steady
breaths
wrenched
from
the
deep
labouring
chests
shining
with
sweat
and
all
along
the
line
the
voices
of
the
men
talking
to
the
horses
everywhere
there
were
visions
of
glossy
brown
backs
straining
heaving
swollen
with
muscle
harness
streaked
with
specks
of
froth
broad
hoofs
heavy
with
brown
loam
men
faces
red
with
tan
blue
overalls
spotted
with
muscled
hands
the
knuckles
whitened
in
their
grip
on
the
reins
and
through
it
all
the
ammoniacal
smell
of
the
horses
the
bitter
reek
of
perspiration
of
beasts
and
men
the
aroma
of
warm
leather
the
scent
of
dead
stubble
and
stronger
and
more
penetrating
than
everything
else
the
heavy
enervating
odour
of
the
upturned
living
earth
at
intervals
from
the
tops
of
one
of
the
rare
low
swells
of
the
land
vanamee
overlooked
a
wider
horizon
on
the
other
divisions
of
quien
sabe
the
same
work
was
in
progress
occasionally
he
could
see
another
column
of
ploughs
in
the
adjoining
division
sometimes
so
close
at
hand
that
the
subdued
murmur
of
its
movements
reached
his
ear
sometimes
so
distant
that
it
resolved
itself
into
a
long
brown
streak
upon
the
grey
of
the
ground
farther
off
to
the
west
on
the
osterman
ranch
other
columns
came
and
went
and
once
from
the
crest
of
the
highest
swell
on
his
division
vanamee
caught
a
distant
glimpse
of
the
broderson
ranch
there
too
moving
specks
indicated
that
the
ploughing
was
under
way
and
farther
away
still
far
off
there
beyond
the
fine
line
of
the
horizons
over
the
curve
of
the
globe
the
shoulder
of
the
earth
he
knew
were
other
ranches
and
beyond
these
others
and
beyond
these
still
others
the
immensities
multiplying
to
infinity
everywhere
throughout
the
great
san
joaquin
unseen
and
unheard
a
thousand
ploughs
the
land
tens
of
thousands
of
shears
clutched
deep
into
the
warm
moist
soil
it
was
the
long
stroking
caress
vigorous
male
powerful
for
which
the
earth
seemed
panting
the
heroic
embrace
of
a
multitude
of
iron
hands
gripping
deep
into
the
brown
warm
flesh
of
the
land
that
quivered
responsive
and
passionate
under
this
rude
advance
so
robust
as
to
be
almost
an
assault
so
violent
as
to
be
veritably
brutal
there
under
the
sun
and
under
the
speckless
sheen
of
the
sky
the
wooing
of
the
titan
began
the
vast
primal
passion
the
two
the
elemental
male
and
female
locked
in
a
colossal
embrace
at
grapples
in
the
throes
of
an
infinite
desire
at
once
terrible
and
divine
knowing
no
law
untamed
savage
natural
sublime
from
time
to
time
the
gang
in
which
vanamee
worked
halted
on
the
signal
from
foreman
or
overseer
the
horses
came
to
a
standstill
the
vague
clamour
of
the
work
lapsed
away
then
the
minutes
passed
the
whole
work
hung
suspended
all
up
and
down
the
line
one
demanded
what
had
happened
the
division
superintendent
galloped
past
perplexed
and
anxious
for
the
moment
one
of
the
ploughs
was
out
of
order
a
bolt
had
slipped
a
lever
refused
to
work
or
a
machine
had
become
immobilised
in
heavy
ground
or
a
horse
had
lamed
himself
once
even
toward
noon
an
entire
plough
was
taken
out
of
the
line
so
out
of
gear
that
a
messenger
had
to
be
sent
to
the
division
forge
to
summon
the
machinist
annixter
had
disappeared
he
had
ridden
farther
on
to
the
other
divisions
of
his
ranch
to
watch
the
work
in
progress
there
at
twelve
according
to
his
orders
all
the
division
superintendents
put
themselves
in
communication
with
him
by
means
of
the
telephone
wires
that
connected
each
of
the
division
houses
reporting
the
condition
of
the
work
the
number
of
acres
covered
the
prospects
of
each
plough
traversing
its
daily
average
of
twenty
miles
at
twelve
vanamee
and
the
rest
of
the
drivers
ate
their
lunch
in
the
field
the
tin
buckets
having
been
distributed
to
them
that
morning
after
breakfast
but
in
the
evening
the
routine
of
the
previous
day
was
repeated
and
vanamee
unharnessing
his
team
riding
one
horse
and
leading
the
others
returned
to
the
division
barns
and
it
was
between
six
and
seven
the
half
hundred
men
of
the
gang
threw
themselves
upon
the
supper
the
chinese
cooks
had
set
out
in
the
shed
of
the
long
as
a
bowling
alley
unpainted
crude
the
seats
benches
the
table
covered
with
oil
cloth
overhead
a
kerosene
lamps
flared
and
smoked
the
table
was
taken
as
if
by
assault
the
clatter
of
iron
knives
upon
the
tin
plates
was
as
the
reverberation
of
hail
upon
a
metal
roof
the
ploughmen
rinsed
their
throats
with
great
draughts
of
wine
and
their
elbows
wide
their
foreheads
flushed
resumed
the
attack
upon
the
beef
and
bread
eating
as
though
they
would
never
have
enough
all
up
and
down
the
long
table
where
the
kerosene
lamps
reflected
themselves
deep
in
the
cover
one
heard
the
incessant
sounds
of
mastication
and
saw
the
uninterrupted
movement
of
great
jaws
at
every
moment
one
or
another
of
the
men
demanded
a
fresh
portion
of
beef
another
pint
of
wine
another
of
bread
for
upwards
of
an
hour
the
gang
ate
it
was
no
longer
a
supper
it
was
a
veritable
barbecue
a
crude
and
primitive
feasting
barbaric
homeric
but
in
all
this
scene
vanamee
saw
nothing
repulsive
presley
would
have
abhorred
it
this
feeding
of
the
people
this
gorging
of
the
human
animal
eager
for
its
meat
vanamee
simple
uncomplicated
living
so
close
to
nature
and
the
rudimentary
life
understood
its
significance
he
knew
very
well
that
within
a
short
after
this
meal
the
men
would
throw
themselves
down
in
their
bunks
to
sleep
without
moving
inert
and
stupefied
with
fatigue
till
the
morning
work
food
and
sleep
all
life
reduced
to
its
bare
essentials
uncomplex
honest
healthy
they
were
strong
these
men
with
the
strength
of
the
soil
they
worked
in
touch
with
the
essential
things
back
again
to
the
starting
point
of
civilisation
coarse
vital
real
and
sane
for
a
brief
moment
immediately
after
the
meal
pipes
were
lit
and
the
air
grew
thick
with
fragrant
tobacco
smoke
on
a
corner
of
the
table
a
game
of
poker
was
begun
one
of
the
drivers
a
swede
produced
an
accordion
a
group
on
the
steps
of
the
listened
with
alternate
gravity
and
shouts
of
laughter
to
the
acknowledged
of
the
gang
but
soon
the
men
began
to
turn
in
stretching
themselves
at
full
length
on
the
horse
blankets
in
the
racklike
bunks
the
sounds
of
heavy
breathing
increased
steadily
lights
were
put
out
and
before
the
afterglow
had
faded
from
the
sky
the
gang
was
asleep
vanamee
however
remained
awake
the
night
was
fine
warm
the
sky
with
starlight
by
and
by
there
would
be
a
moon
in
the
first
watch
after
the
twilight
a
faint
puff
of
breeze
came
up
out
of
the
south
from
all
around
the
heavy
penetrating
smell
of
the
earth
exhaled
steadily
into
the
darkness
after
a
while
when
the
moon
came
up
he
could
see
the
vast
brown
breast
of
the
earth
turn
toward
it
far
off
distant
objects
came
into
view
the
giant
oak
tree
at
hooven
ranch
house
near
the
irrigating
ditch
on
los
muertos
the
tower
of
the
windmill
on
annixter
home
ranch
the
clump
of
willows
along
broderson
creek
close
to
the
long
trestle
and
last
of
all
the
venerable
tower
of
the
mission
of
san
juan
on
the
high
ground
beyond
the
creek
thitherward
like
homing
pigeons
vanamee
thoughts
turned
irresistibly
near
to
that
tower
just
beyond
in
the
little
hollow
hidden
now
from
his
sight
was
the
seed
ranch
where
angele
varian
had
lived
straining
his
eyes
peering
across
the
intervening
levels
vanamee
fancied
he
could
almost
see
the
line
of
venerable
pear
trees
in
whose
shadow
she
had
been
accustomed
to
wait
for
him
on
many
such
a
night
as
this
he
had
crossed
the
ranches
to
find
her
there
his
mind
went
back
to
that
wonderful
time
of
his
life
sixteen
years
before
this
when
angele
was
alive
when
they
two
were
involved
in
the
sweet
intricacies
of
a
love
so
fine
so
pure
so
marvellous
that
it
seemed
to
them
a
miracle
a
manifestation
a
thing
veritably
divine
put
into
the
life
of
them
and
the
hearts
of
them
by
god
himself
to
that
they
had
been
born
for
this
love
sake
they
had
come
into
the
world
and
the
mingling
of
their
lives
was
to
be
the
perfect
life
the
intended
ordained
union
of
the
soul
of
man
with
the
soul
of
woman
indissoluble
harmonious
as
music
beautiful
beyond
all
thought
a
foretaste
of
heaven
a
hostage
of
immortality
no
he
vanamee
could
never
never
forget
never
was
the
edge
of
his
grief
to
lose
its
sharpness
never
would
the
lapse
of
time
blunt
the
tooth
of
his
pain
once
more
as
he
sat
there
looking
off
across
the
ranches
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ancient
campanile
of
the
mission
church
the
anguish
that
would
not
die
leaped
at
his
throat
tearing
at
his
heart
shaking
him
and
rending
him
with
a
violence
as
fierce
and
as
profound
as
if
it
all
had
been
but
yesterday
the
ache
returned
to
his
heart
a
physical
keen
pain
his
hands
gripped
tight
together
twisting
interlocked
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
his
whole
body
shaken
and
riven
from
head
to
heel
he
had
lost
her
god
had
not
meant
it
after
all
the
whole
matter
had
been
a
mistake
that
vast
wonderful
love
that
had
come
upon
them
had
been
only
the
flimsiest
mockery
abruptly
vanamee
rose
he
knew
the
night
that
was
before
him
at
intervals
throughout
the
course
of
his
prolonged
wanderings
in
the
desert
on
the
mesa
deep
in
the
canon
lost
and
forgotten
on
the
flanks
of
unnamed
mountains
alone
under
the
stars
and
under
the
moon
white
eye
these
hours
came
to
him
his
grief
recoiling
upon
him
like
the
recoil
of
a
vast
and
terrible
engine
then
he
must
fight
out
the
night
wrestling
with
his
sorrow
praying
sometimes
incoherent
hardly
conscious
asking
why
of
the
night
and
of
the
stars
such
another
night
had
come
to
him
now
until
dawn
he
knew
he
must
struggle
with
his
grief
torn
with
memories
his
imagination
assaulted
with
visions
of
a
vanished
happiness
if
this
paroxysm
of
sorrow
was
to
assail
him
again
that
night
there
was
but
one
place
for
him
to
be
he
would
go
to
the
mission
he
would
see
father
sarria
he
would
pass
the
night
in
the
deep
shadow
of
the
aged
pear
trees
in
the
mission
garden
he
struck
out
across
quien
sabe
his
face
the
face
of
an
ascetic
lean
brown
infinitely
sad
set
toward
the
mission
church
in
about
an
hour
he
reached
and
crossed
the
road
that
led
northward
from
guadalajara
toward
the
seed
ranch
and
a
little
farther
on
forded
broderson
creek
where
it
ran
through
one
corner
of
the
mission
land
he
climbed
the
hill
and
halted
out
of
breath
from
his
brisk
wall
at
the
end
of
the
colonnade
of
the
mission
itself
until
this
moment
vanamee
had
not
trusted
himself
to
see
the
mission
at
night
on
the
occasion
of
his
first
daytime
visit
with
presley
he
had
hurried
away
even
before
the
twilight
had
set
in
not
daring
for
the
moment
to
face
the
crowding
phantoms
that
in
his
imagination
filled
the
mission
garden
after
dark
in
the
daylight
the
place
had
seemed
strange
to
him
none
of
his
associations
with
the
old
building
and
its
surroundings
were
those
of
sunlight
and
brightness
whenever
during
his
long
sojourns
in
the
wilderness
of
the
southwest
he
had
called
up
the
picture
in
the
eye
of
his
mind
it
had
always
appeared
to
him
in
the
dim
mystery
of
moonless
nights
the
venerable
pear
trees
black
with
shadow
the
fountain
a
thing
to
be
heard
rather
than
seen
but
as
yet
he
had
not
entered
the
garden
that
lay
on
the
other
side
of
the
mission
vanamee
passed
down
the
colonnade
with
its
uneven
pavement
of
worn
red
bricks
to
the
last
door
by
the
belfry
tower
and
rang
the
little
bell
by
pulling
the
leather
thong
that
hung
from
a
hole
in
the
door
above
the
knob
but
the
who
after
a
long
interval
opened
the
door
blinking
and
confused
at
being
roused
from
her
sleep
told
vanamee
that
sarria
was
not
in
his
room
vanamee
however
was
known
to
her
as
the
priest
protege
and
great
friend
and
she
allowed
him
to
enter
telling
him
that
no
doubt
he
would
find
sarria
in
the
church
itself
the
servant
led
the
way
down
the
cool
adobe
passage
to
a
larger
room
that
occupied
the
entire
width
of
the
bottom
of
the
belfry
tower
and
whence
a
flight
of
aged
steps
led
upward
into
the
dark
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
was
a
door
opening
into
the
church
the
servant
admitted
vanamee
closing
the
door
behind
her
the
interior
of
the
mission
a
great
oblong
of
adobe
with
a
flat
ceiling
was
lighted
dimly
by
the
sanctuary
lamp
that
hung
from
three
long
chains
just
over
the
chancel
rail
at
the
far
end
of
the
church
and
by
two
or
three
cheap
kerosene
lamps
in
brackets
of
imitation
bronze
all
around
the
walls
was
the
inevitable
series
of
pictures
representing
the
stations
of
the
cross
they
were
of
a
hideous
crudity
of
design
and
composition
yet
were
wrought
out
with
an
innocent
unquestioning
sincerity
that
was
not
without
its
charm
each
picture
framed
alike
in
gilt
bore
its
suitable
inscription
in
staring
black
letters
simon
the
cyrenean
helps
jesus
to
carry
his
saint
veronica
wipes
the
face
of
jesus
falls
for
the
fourth
time
and
so
on
up
the
length
of
the
church
the
pews
began
boxes
of
blackened
oak
shining
from
years
of
friction
each
with
its
door
while
over
them
and
built
out
from
the
wall
was
the
pulpit
with
its
tarnished
gilt
above
it
like
the
raised
cover
of
a
great
between
the
pews
in
the
aisle
the
violent
vermilion
of
a
strip
of
ingrain
carpet
assaulted
the
eye
farther
on
were
the
steps
to
the
altar
the
chancel
rail
of
oak
the
high
altar
with
its
napery
from
the
bargain
counters
of
a
san
francisco
store
the
massive
silver
candlesticks
each
as
much
as
one
man
could
lift
the
gift
of
a
dead
spanish
queen
and
last
the
pictures
of
the
chancel
the
virgin
in
a
glory
a
christ
in
agony
on
the
cross
and
john
the
baptist
the
patron
saint
of
the
mission
the
san
juan
bautista
of
the
early
days
a
gaunt
grey
figure
in
skins
two
fingers
upraised
in
the
gesture
of
benediction
the
air
of
the
place
was
cool
and
damp
and
heavy
with
the
flat
sweet
scent
of
stale
incense
smoke
it
was
of
a
stillness
and
the
closing
of
the
door
behind
vanamee
reechoed
from
corner
to
corner
with
a
prolonged
reverberation
of
thunder
however
father
sarria
was
not
in
the
church
vanamee
took
a
couple
of
turns
the
length
of
the
aisle
looking
about
into
the
chapels
on
either
side
of
the
chancel
but
the
building
was
deserted
the
priest
had
been
there
recently
nevertheless
for
the
altar
furniture
was
in
disarray
as
though
he
had
been
rearranging
it
but
a
moment
before
on
both
sides
of
the
church
and
up
their
length
the
walls
were
pierced
by
low
archways
in
which
were
massive
wooden
doors
clamped
with
iron
bolts
one
of
these
doors
on
the
pulpit
side
of
the
church
stood
ajar
and
stepping
to
it
and
pushing
it
wide
open
vanamee
looked
diagonally
across
a
little
patch
of
vegetables
beets
radishes
and
lettuce
to
the
rear
of
the
building
that
had
once
contained
the
cloisters
and
through
an
open
window
saw
father
sarria
diligently
polishing
the
silver
crucifix
that
usually
stood
on
the
high
altar
vanamee
did
not
call
to
the
priest
putting
a
finger
to
either
temple
he
fixed
his
eyes
steadily
upon
him
for
a
moment
as
he
moved
about
at
his
work
in
a
few
seconds
he
closed
his
eyes
but
only
part
way
the
pupils
contracted
his
forehead
lowered
to
an
expression
of
poignant
intensity
soon
afterward
he
saw
the
priest
pause
abruptly
in
the
act
of
drawing
the
cover
over
the
crucifix
looking
about
him
from
side
to
side
he
turned
again
to
his
work
and
again
came
to
a
stop
perplexed
curious
with
uncertain
steps
and
evidently
wondering
why
he
did
so
he
came
to
the
door
of
the
room
and
opened
it
looking
out
into
the
night
vanamee
hidden
in
the
deep
shadow
of
the
archway
did
not
move
but
his
eyes
closed
and
the
intense
expression
deepened
on
his
face
the
priest
hesitated
moved
forward
a
step
turned
back
paused
again
then
came
straight
across
the
garden
patch
brusquely
colliding
with
vanamee
still
motionless
in
the
recess
of
the
archway
sarria
gave
a
great
start
catching
his
breath
oh
oh
it
you
was
it
you
i
heard
calling
no
i
could
not
have
heard
i
remember
now
what
a
strange
power
i
am
not
sure
that
it
is
right
to
do
this
thing
vanamee
i
i
had
to
come
i
do
not
know
why
it
is
a
great
force
a
power
i
do
like
it
vanamee
sometimes
it
frightens
vanamee
put
his
chin
in
the
air
if
i
had
wanted
to
sir
i
could
have
made
you
come
to
me
from
back
there
in
the
quien
sabe
the
priest
shook
his
head
it
troubles
me
he
said
to
think
that
my
own
will
can
count
for
so
little
just
now
i
could
not
resist
if
a
deep
river
had
been
between
us
i
must
have
crossed
it
suppose
i
had
been
asleep
now
it
would
have
been
all
the
easier
answered
vanamee
i
understand
as
little
of
these
things
as
you
but
i
think
if
you
had
been
asleep
your
power
of
resistance
would
have
been
so
much
the
more
perhaps
i
should
not
have
waked
perhaps
i
should
have
come
to
you
in
my
sarria
crossed
himself
it
is
occult
he
hazarded
no
i
do
not
like
it
dear
fellow
he
put
his
hand
on
vanamee
shoulder
do
call
me
that
way
again
promise
see
he
held
out
his
hand
i
am
all
of
a
tremble
there
we
wo
speak
of
it
further
wait
for
me
a
moment
i
have
only
to
put
the
cross
in
its
place
and
a
fresh
altar
cloth
and
then
i
am
done
is
the
feast
of
the
holy
cross
and
i
am
preparing
against
it
the
night
is
fine
we
will
smoke
a
cigar
in
the
cloister
a
few
moments
later
the
two
passed
out
of
the
door
on
the
other
side
of
the
church
opposite
the
pulpit
sarria
adjusting
a
silk
skull
cap
on
his
tonsured
head
he
wore
his
cassock
now
and
was
far
more
the
churchman
in
appearance
than
when
vanamee
and
presley
had
seen
him
on
a
former
occasion
they
were
now
in
the
cloister
garden
the
place
was
charming
everywhere
grew
clumps
of
palms
and
magnolia
trees
a
grapevine
over
a
century
old
occupied
a
trellis
in
one
angle
of
the
walls
which
surrounded
the
garden
on
two
sides
along
the
third
side
was
the
church
itself
while
the
fourth
was
open
the
wall
having
crumbled
away
its
site
marked
only
by
a
line
of
eight
great
pear
trees
older
even
than
the
grapevine
gnarled
twisted
bearing
no
fruit
directly
opposite
the
pear
trees
in
the
south
wall
of
the
garden
was
a
round
arched
portal
whose
gate
giving
upon
the
esplanade
in
front
of
the
mission
was
always
closed
small
gravelled
walks
well
kept
bordered
with
mignonette
twisted
about
among
the
flower
beds
and
underneath
the
magnolia
trees
in
the
centre
was
a
little
fountain
in
a
stone
basin
green
with
moss
while
just
beyond
between
the
fountain
and
the
pear
trees
stood
what
was
left
of
a
sun
dial
the
bronze
gnomon
green
with
the
beatings
of
the
weather
the
figures
on
the
of
the
dial
worn
away
illegible
but
on
the
other
side
of
the
fountain
and
directly
opposite
the
door
of
the
mission
ranged
against
the
wall
were
nine
graves
three
with
headstones
the
rest
with
slabs
two
of
sarria
predecessors
were
buried
here
three
of
the
graves
were
those
of
mission
indians
one
was
thought
to
contain
a
former
alcalde
of
guadalajara
two
more
held
the
bodies
of
de
la
cuesta
and
his
young
wife
taking
with
her
to
the
grave
the
illusion
of
her
husband
love
and
the
last
one
the
ninth
at
the
end
of
the
line
nearest
the
pear
trees
was
marked
by
a
little
headstone
the
smallest
of
any
on
which
together
with
the
proper
dates
only
sixteen
years
apart
was
cut
the
name
angele
but
the
quiet
the
repose
the
isolation
of
the
little
cloister
garden
was
infinitely
delicious
it
was
a
tiny
corner
of
the
great
valley
that
stretched
in
all
directions
around
it
shut
off
discreet
romantic
a
garden
of
dreams
of
enchantments
of
illusions
outside
there
far
off
the
great
grim
world
went
clashing
through
its
grooves
but
in
here
never
an
echo
of
the
grinding
of
its
wheels
entered
to
jar
upon
the
subdued
modulation
of
the
fountain
uninterrupted
murmur
sarria
and
vanamee
found
their
way
to
a
stone
bench
against
the
side
wall
of
the
mission
near
the
door
from
which
they
had
just
issued
and
sat
down
sarria
lighting
a
cigar
vanamee
rolling
and
smoking
cigarettes
in
mexican
fashion
all
about
them
widened
the
vast
calm
night
all
the
stars
were
out
the
moon
was
coming
up
there
was
no
wind
no
sound
the
insistent
flowing
of
the
fountain
seemed
only
as
the
symbol
of
the
passing
of
time
a
thing
that
was
understood
rather
than
heard
inevitable
prolonged
at
long
intervals
a
faint
breeze
hardly
more
than
a
breath
found
its
way
into
the
garden
over
the
enclosing
walls
and
passed
overhead
spreading
everywhere
the
delicious
mingled
perfume
of
magnolia
blossoms
of
mignonette
of
moss
of
grass
and
all
the
calm
green
life
silently
teeming
within
the
enclosure
of
the
walls
from
where
he
sat
vanamee
turning
his
head
could
look
out
underneath
the
pear
trees
to
the
north
close
at
hand
a
little
valley
lay
between
the
high
ground
on
which
the
mission
was
built
and
the
line
of
low
hills
just
beyond
broderson
creek
on
the
quien
sabe
in
here
was
the
seed
ranch
which
angele
people
had
cultivated
a
unique
and
beautiful
stretch
of
five
hundred
acres
planted
thick
with
roses
violets
lilies
tulips
iris
carnations
poppies
heliotrope
all
manner
and
description
of
flowers
five
hundred
acres
of
them
solid
thick
exuberant
blooming
and
fading
and
leaving
their
seed
or
slips
to
be
marketed
broadcast
all
over
the
united
states
this
had
been
the
vocation
of
angele
parents
raising
flowers
for
their
seeds
all
over
the
country
the
seed
ranch
was
known
now
it
was
arid
almost
dry
but
when
in
full
flower
toward
the
middle
of
summer
the
sight
of
these
acres
royal
with
colour
vermilion
azure
flaming
yellow
was
a
marvel
when
an
east
wind
blew
men
on
the
streets
of
bonneville
nearly
twelve
miles
away
could
catch
the
scent
of
this
valley
of
flowers
this
chaos
of
perfume
and
into
this
life
of
flowers
this
world
of
colour
this
atmosphere
oppressive
and
clogged
and
cloyed
and
thickened
with
sweet
odour
angele
had
been
born
there
she
had
lived
her
sixteen
years
there
she
had
died
it
was
not
surprising
that
vanamee
with
his
intense
delicate
sensitiveness
to
beauty
his
almost
abnormal
capacity
for
great
happiness
had
been
drawn
to
her
had
loved
her
so
deeply
she
came
to
him
from
out
of
the
flowers
the
smell
of
the
roses
in
her
hair
of
gold
that
hung
in
two
straight
plaits
on
either
side
of
her
face
the
reflection
of
the
violets
in
the
profound
dark
blue
of
her
eyes
perplexing
oriental
the
aroma
and
the
imperial
red
of
the
carnations
in
her
lips
with
their
almost
egyptian
fulness
the
whiteness
of
the
lilies
the
perfume
of
the
lilies
and
the
lilies
slender
balancing
grace
in
her
neck
her
hands
disengaged
the
odour
of
the
heliotropes
the
folds
of
her
dress
gave
off
the
enervating
scent
of
poppies
her
feet
were
redolent
of
hyacinths
for
a
long
time
after
sitting
down
upon
the
bench
neither
the
priest
nor
vanamee
spoke
but
after
a
while
sarria
took
his
cigar
from
his
lips
saying
how
still
it
is
this
is
a
beautiful
old
garden
peaceful
very
quiet
some
day
i
shall
be
buried
here
i
like
to
remember
that
and
you
too
quien
sabe
yes
you
too
where
else
no
it
is
better
here
yonder
by
the
side
of
the
little
i
am
not
able
to
look
forward
yet
sir
the
things
that
are
to
be
are
somehow
nothing
to
me
at
all
for
me
they
amount
to
they
amount
to
everything
my
yes
to
one
part
of
me
but
not
to
the
part
of
me
that
belonged
to
angele
the
best
part
oh
you
do
know
he
exclaimed
with
a
sudden
movement
no
one
can
understand
what
is
it
to
me
when
you
tell
me
that
sometime
after
i
shall
die
too
somewhere
in
a
vague
place
you
call
heaven
i
shall
see
her
again
do
you
think
that
the
idea
of
that
ever
made
any
one
sorrow
easier
to
bear
ever
took
the
edge
from
any
grief
but
you
believe
that
oh
believe
believe
echoed
the
other
what
do
i
believe
i
know
i
believe
or
i
do
believe
i
can
remember
what
she
was
but
i
can
not
hope
what
she
will
be
hope
after
all
is
only
memory
seen
reversed
when
i
try
to
see
her
in
another
life
whatever
you
call
it
in
heaven
beyond
the
grave
this
vague
place
of
yours
when
i
try
to
see
her
there
she
comes
to
my
imagination
only
as
what
she
was
material
earthly
as
i
loved
her
imperfect
you
say
but
that
is
as
i
saw
her
and
as
i
saw
her
i
loved
her
and
as
she
was
material
earthly
imperfect
she
loved
me
it
that
that
i
want
he
exclaimed
i
do
want
her
changed
i
do
want
her
spiritualised
exalted
glorified
celestial
i
want
her
i
think
it
is
only
this
feeling
that
has
kept
me
from
killing
myself
i
would
rather
be
unhappy
in
the
memory
of
what
she
actually
was
than
be
happy
in
the
realisation
of
her
transformed
changed
made
celestial
i
am
only
human
her
soul
that
was
beautiful
no
doubt
but
again
it
was
something
very
vague
intangible
hardly
more
than
a
phrase
but
the
touch
of
her
hand
was
real
the
sound
of
her
voice
was
real
the
clasp
of
her
arms
about
my
neck
was
real
oh
he
cried
shaken
with
a
sudden
wrench
of
passion
give
those
back
to
me
tell
your
god
to
give
those
back
to
me
the
sound
of
her
voice
the
touch
of
her
hand
the
clasp
of
her
dear
arms
real
real
and
then
you
may
talk
to
me
of
sarria
shook
his
head
but
when
you
meet
her
again
he
observed
in
heaven
you
too
will
be
changed
you
will
see
her
spiritualised
with
spiritual
eyes
as
she
is
now
she
does
not
appeal
to
you
i
understand
that
it
is
because
as
you
say
you
are
only
human
while
she
is
divine
but
when
you
come
to
be
like
her
as
she
is
now
you
will
know
her
as
she
really
is
not
as
she
seemed
to
be
because
her
voice
was
sweet
because
her
hair
was
pretty
because
her
hand
was
warm
in
yours
vanamee
your
talk
is
that
of
a
foolish
child
you
are
like
one
of
the
corinthians
to
whom
paul
wrote
do
you
remember
listen
now
i
can
recall
the
words
and
such
words
beautiful
and
terrible
at
the
same
time
such
a
majesty
they
march
like
soldiers
with
trumpets
some
man
will
say
as
you
have
said
just
now
are
the
dead
raised
up
and
with
what
body
do
they
come
thou
fool
that
which
thou
sowest
is
not
quickened
except
it
die
and
that
which
thou
sowest
thou
sowest
not
that
body
that
shall
be
but
bare
grain
it
may
chance
of
wheat
or
of
some
other
grain
but
god
giveth
it
a
body
as
it
hath
pleased
him
and
to
every
seed
his
own
body
it
is
sown
a
natural
body
it
is
raised
a
spiritual
body
it
is
because
you
are
a
natural
body
that
you
can
not
understand
her
nor
wish
for
her
as
a
spiritual
body
but
when
you
are
both
spiritual
then
you
shall
know
each
other
as
you
are
know
as
you
never
knew
before
your
grain
of
wheat
is
your
symbol
of
immortality
you
bury
it
in
the
earth
it
dies
and
rises
again
a
thousand
times
more
beautiful
vanamee
your
dear
girl
was
only
a
grain
of
humanity
that
we
have
buried
here
and
the
end
is
not
yet
but
all
this
is
so
old
so
old
the
world
learned
it
a
thousand
years
ago
and
yet
each
man
that
has
ever
stood
by
the
open
grave
of
any
one
he
loved
must
learn
it
all
over
again
from
the
vanamee
was
silent
for
a
moment
looking
off
with
unseeing
eyes
between
the
trunks
of
the
pear
trees
over
the
little
valley
that
may
all
be
as
you
say
he
answered
after
a
while
i
have
not
learned
it
yet
in
any
case
now
i
only
know
that
i
love
her
oh
as
if
it
all
were
yesterday
and
that
i
am
suffering
suffering
he
leaned
forward
his
head
supported
on
his
clenched
fists
the
infinite
sadness
of
his
face
deepening
like
a
shadow
the
tears
brimming
in
his
eyes
a
question
that
he
must
ask
which
involved
the
thing
that
was
scarcely
to
be
thought
of
occurred
to
him
at
this
moment
after
hesitating
for
a
long
moment
he
said
i
have
been
away
a
long
time
and
i
have
had
no
news
of
this
place
since
i
left
is
there
anything
to
tell
father
has
any
discovery
been
made
any
suspicion
developed
as
to
the
other
the
priest
shook
his
head
not
a
word
not
a
whisper
it
is
a
mystery
it
always
will
vanamee
clasped
his
head
between
his
clenched
fists
rocking
himself
to
and
fro
oh
the
terror
of
it
he
murmured
the
horror
of
it
and
she
think
of
it
sarria
only
sixteen
a
little
girl
so
innocent
that
she
never
knew
what
wrong
meant
pure
as
a
little
child
is
pure
who
believed
that
all
things
were
good
mature
only
in
her
love
and
to
be
struck
down
like
that
while
your
god
looked
down
from
heaven
and
would
not
take
her
all
at
once
he
seemed
to
lose
control
of
himself
one
of
those
furies
of
impotent
grief
and
wrath
that
assailed
him
from
time
to
time
blind
insensate
incoherent
suddenly
took
possession
of
him
a
torrent
of
words
issued
from
his
lips
and
he
flung
out
an
arm
the
fist
clenched
in
a
fierce
quick
gesture
partly
of
despair
partly
of
defiance
partly
of
supplication
no
your
god
would
not
take
her
part
where
was
god
mercy
in
that
where
was
heaven
protection
in
that
where
was
the
loving
kindness
you
preach
about
why
did
god
give
her
life
if
it
was
to
be
stamped
out
why
did
god
give
her
the
power
of
love
if
it
was
to
come
to
nothing
sarria
listen
to
me
why
did
god
make
her
so
divinely
pure
if
he
permitted
that
abomination
ha
he
exclaimed
bitterly
your
god
why
an
apache
buck
would
have
been
more
merciful
your
god
there
is
no
god
there
is
only
the
devil
the
heaven
you
pray
to
is
only
a
joke
a
wretched
trick
a
delusion
it
is
only
hell
that
is
sarria
caught
him
by
the
arm
you
are
a
fool
and
a
child
he
exclaimed
and
it
is
blasphemy
that
you
are
saying
i
forbid
it
you
understand
i
forbid
vanamee
turned
on
him
with
a
sudden
cry
then
tell
your
god
to
give
her
back
to
me
sarria
started
away
from
him
his
eyes
widening
in
astonishment
surprised
out
of
all
composure
by
the
other
outburst
swarthy
face
was
pale
the
sunken
cheeks
and
eyes
were
marked
with
great
black
shadows
the
priest
no
longer
recognised
him
the
face
that
face
of
the
ascetic
lean
framed
in
its
long
black
hair
and
pointed
beard
was
quivering
with
the
excitement
of
hallucination
it
was
the
face
of
the
inspired
shepherds
of
the
hebraic
legends
living
close
to
nature
the
younger
prophets
of
israel
dwellers
in
the
wilderness
solitary
imaginative
believing
in
the
vision
having
strange
delusions
gifted
with
strange
powers
in
a
brief
second
of
thought
sarria
understood
out
into
the
wilderness
the
vast
arid
desert
of
the
southwest
vanamee
had
carried
his
grief
for
days
for
weeks
months
even
he
had
been
alone
a
solitary
speck
lost
in
the
immensity
of
the
horizons
continually
he
was
brooding
haunted
with
his
sorrow
thinking
thinking
often
hard
put
to
it
for
food
the
body
was
and
the
mind
concentrated
forever
upon
one
subject
had
recoiled
upon
itself
had
preyed
upon
the
naturally
nervous
temperament
till
the
imagination
had
become
exalted
morbidly
active
diseased
beset
with
hallucinations
forever
in
search
of
the
manifestation
of
the
miracle
it
was
small
wonder
that
bringing
a
fancy
so
distorted
back
to
the
scene
of
a
vanished
happiness
vanamee
should
be
racked
with
the
most
violent
illusions
beset
in
the
throes
of
a
veritable
hysteria
tell
your
god
to
give
her
back
to
me
he
repeated
with
fierce
insistence
it
was
the
pitch
of
mysticism
the
imagination
harassed
and
goaded
beyond
the
normal
round
suddenly
flipping
from
the
circumference
spinning
off
at
a
tangent
out
into
the
void
where
all
things
seemed
possible
hurtling
through
the
dark
there
groping
for
the
supernatural
clamouring
for
the
miracle
and
it
was
also
the
human
natural
protest
against
the
inevitable
the
irrevocable
the
spasm
of
revolt
under
the
sting
of
death
the
rebellion
of
the
soul
at
the
victory
of
the
grave
he
can
give
her
back
to
me
if
he
only
will
vanamee
cried
sarria
you
must
help
me
i
tell
you
i
warn
you
sir
i
ca
last
much
longer
under
it
my
head
is
all
wrong
with
it
i
no
more
hold
on
my
mind
something
must
happen
or
i
shall
lose
my
senses
i
am
breaking
down
under
it
all
my
body
and
my
mind
alike
bring
her
to
me
make
god
show
her
to
me
if
all
tales
are
true
it
would
not
be
the
first
time
if
i
can
not
have
her
at
least
let
me
see
her
as
she
was
real
earthly
not
her
spirit
her
ghost
i
want
her
real
self
undefiled
again
if
this
is
dementia
then
let
me
be
demented
but
help
me
you
and
your
god
create
the
delusion
do
the
stop
cried
the
priest
again
shaking
him
roughly
by
the
shoulder
stop
be
yourself
this
is
dementia
but
i
shall
not
let
you
be
demented
think
of
what
you
are
saying
bring
her
back
to
you
is
that
the
way
of
god
i
thought
you
were
a
man
this
is
the
talk
of
a
vanamee
stirred
abruptly
in
his
place
drawing
a
long
breath
and
looking
about
him
vaguely
as
if
he
came
to
himself
you
are
right
he
muttered
i
hardly
know
what
i
am
saying
at
times
but
there
are
moments
when
my
whole
mind
and
soul
seem
to
rise
up
in
rebellion
against
what
has
happened
when
it
seems
to
me
that
i
am
stronger
than
death
and
that
if
i
only
knew
how
to
use
the
strength
of
my
will
concentrate
my
power
of
thought
volition
that
i
could
i
do
know
not
call
her
back
but
something
a
diseased
and
distorted
mind
is
capable
of
hallucinations
if
that
is
what
you
mean
observed
sarria
perhaps
that
is
what
i
mean
perhaps
i
want
only
the
delusion
after
sarria
did
not
reply
and
there
was
a
long
silence
in
the
damp
south
corners
of
the
walls
a
frog
began
to
croak
at
exact
intervals
the
little
fountain
rippled
monotonously
and
a
magnolia
flower
dropped
from
one
of
the
trees
falling
straight
as
a
plummet
through
the
motionless
air
and
settling
upon
the
gravelled
walk
with
a
faint
rustling
sound
otherwise
the
stillness
was
profound
a
little
later
the
priest
cigar
long
since
out
slipped
from
his
fingers
to
the
ground
he
began
to
nod
gently
vanamee
touched
his
arm
asleep
sir
the
other
started
rubbing
his
eyes
upon
my
word
i
believe
i
better
go
to
bed
sir
i
am
not
tired
i
think
i
shall
sit
out
here
a
little
well
perhaps
i
would
be
better
off
in
bed
your
bed
is
always
ready
for
you
here
whenever
you
want
to
use
no
i
shall
go
back
to
quien
sabe
later
my
vanamee
was
left
alone
for
a
long
time
he
sat
motionless
in
his
place
his
elbows
on
his
knees
his
chin
propped
in
his
hands
the
minutes
passed
then
the
hours
the
moon
climbed
steadily
higher
among
the
stars
vanamee
rolled
and
smoked
cigarette
after
cigarette
the
blue
haze
of
smoke
hanging
motionless
above
his
head
or
drifting
in
slowly
weaving
filaments
across
the
open
spaces
of
the
garden
but
the
influence
of
the
old
enclosure
this
corner
of
romance
and
mystery
this
isolated
garden
of
dreams
savouring
of
the
past
with
its
legends
its
graves
its
crumbling
sun
dial
its
fountain
with
its
rime
of
moss
was
not
to
be
resisted
now
that
the
priest
had
left
him
the
same
exaltation
of
spirit
that
had
seized
upon
vanamee
earlier
in
the
evening
by
degrees
grew
big
again
in
his
mind
and
imagination
his
sorrow
assaulted
him
like
the
flagellations
of
a
fine
whiplash
and
his
love
for
angele
rose
again
in
his
heart
it
seemed
to
him
never
so
deep
so
tender
so
infinitely
strong
no
doubt
it
was
his
familiarity
with
the
mission
garden
his
remembrance
of
it
as
it
was
in
the
days
when
he
had
met
angele
there
tallying
now
so
exactly
with
the
reality
there
under
his
eyes
that
brought
her
to
his
imagination
so
vividly
as
yet
he
dared
not
trust
himself
near
her
grave
but
for
the
moment
he
rose
and
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
walked
slowly
from
point
to
point
amid
the
tiny
gravelled
walks
recalling
the
incidents
of
eighteen
years
ago
on
the
bench
he
had
quitted
he
and
angele
had
often
sat
here
by
the
crumbling
sun
dial
he
recalled
the
night
when
he
had
kissed
her
for
the
first
time
here
again
by
the
rim
of
the
fountain
with
its
fringe
of
green
she
once
had
paused
and
baring
her
arm
to
the
shoulder
had
thrust
it
deep
into
the
water
and
then
withdrawing
it
had
given
it
to
him
to
kiss
all
wet
and
cool
and
here
at
last
under
the
shadow
of
the
pear
trees
they
had
sat
evening
after
evening
looking
off
over
the
little
valley
below
them
watching
the
night
build
itself
from
horizon
to
zenith
brusquely
vanamee
turned
away
from
the
prospect
the
seed
ranch
was
dark
at
this
time
of
the
year
and
flowerless
far
off
toward
its
centre
he
had
caught
a
brief
glimpse
of
the
house
where
angele
had
lived
and
a
faint
light
burning
in
its
window
but
he
turned
from
it
sharply
the
travail
of
his
grief
abruptly
reached
the
paroxysm
with
long
strides
he
crossed
the
garden
and
reentered
the
mission
church
itself
plunging
into
the
coolness
of
its
atmosphere
as
into
a
bath
what
he
searched
for
he
did
not
know
or
rather
did
not
define
he
knew
only
that
he
was
suffering
that
a
longing
for
angele
for
some
object
around
which
his
great
love
could
enfold
itself
was
tearing
at
his
heart
with
iron
teeth
he
was
ready
to
be
deluded
craved
the
hallucination
begged
pitifully
for
the
illusion
anything
rather
than
the
empty
tenantless
night
the
voiceless
silence
the
vast
loneliness
of
the
overspanning
arc
of
the
heavens
before
the
chancel
rail
of
the
altar
under
the
sanctuary
lamp
vanamee
sank
upon
his
knees
his
arms
folded
upon
the
rail
his
head
bowed
down
upon
them
he
prayed
with
what
words
he
could
not
say
for
what
he
did
not
understand
for
help
merely
for
relief
for
an
answer
to
his
cry
it
was
upon
that
at
length
that
his
disordered
mind
concentrated
itself
an
answer
he
demanded
he
implored
an
answer
not
a
vague
visitation
of
grace
not
a
formless
sense
of
peace
but
an
answer
something
real
even
if
the
reality
were
fancied
a
voice
out
of
the
night
responding
to
his
a
hand
in
the
dark
clasping
his
groping
fingers
a
breath
human
warm
fragrant
familiar
like
a
soft
sweet
caress
on
his
shrunken
cheeks
alone
there
in
the
dim
of
the
decaying
mission
with
its
crumbling
plaster
its
naive
crudity
of
ornament
and
picture
he
wrestled
fiercely
with
his
desires
words
fragments
of
sentences
inarticulate
incoherent
wrenched
from
his
teeth
but
the
answer
was
not
in
the
church
above
him
over
the
high
altar
the
virgin
in
a
glory
with
downcast
eyes
and
folded
hands
grew
vague
and
indistinct
in
the
shadow
the
colours
fading
tarnished
by
centuries
of
incense
smoke
the
christ
in
agony
on
the
cross
was
but
a
lamentable
vision
of
tormented
anatomy
grey
flesh
spotted
with
crimson
the
john
the
san
juan
bautista
patron
saint
of
the
mission
the
gaunt
figure
in
skins
two
fingers
upraised
in
the
gesture
of
benediction
gazed
stolidly
out
into
the
under
the
ceiling
ignoring
the
human
distress
that
beat
itself
in
vain
against
the
altar
rail
below
and
angele
remained
as
before
only
a
memory
far
distant
intangible
lost
vanamee
rose
turning
his
back
upon
the
altar
with
a
vague
gesture
of
despair
he
crossed
the
church
and
issuing
from
the
door
opposite
the
pulpit
once
more
stepped
out
into
the
garden
here
at
least
was
reality
the
warm
still
air
descended
upon
him
like
a
cloak
grateful
comforting
dispelling
the
chill
that
lurked
in
the
damp
mould
of
plaster
and
crumbling
adobe
but
now
he
found
his
way
across
the
garden
on
the
other
side
of
the
fountain
where
ranged
against
the
eastern
wall
were
nine
graves
here
angele
was
buried
in
the
smallest
grave
of
them
all
marked
by
the
little
headstone
with
its
two
dates
only
sixteen
years
apart
to
this
spot
at
last
he
had
returned
after
the
years
spent
in
the
desert
the
wilderness
after
all
the
wanderings
of
the
long
trail
here
if
ever
he
must
have
a
sense
of
her
nearness
close
at
hand
a
short
four
feet
under
that
mound
of
grass
was
the
form
he
had
so
often
held
in
the
embrace
of
his
arms
the
face
the
very
face
he
had
kissed
that
face
with
the
hair
of
gold
making
the
round
white
forehead
the
eyes
with
their
strange
oriental
slant
upward
toward
the
temples
the
sweet
full
lips
almost
egyptian
in
their
fulness
all
that
strange
perplexing
wonderful
beauty
so
troublous
so
enchanting
so
out
of
all
accepted
standards
he
bent
down
dropping
upon
one
knee
a
hand
upon
the
headstone
and
read
again
the
inscription
then
instinctively
his
hand
left
the
stone
and
rested
upon
the
low
mound
of
turf
touching
it
with
the
softness
of
a
caress
and
then
before
he
was
aware
of
it
he
was
stretched
at
full
length
upon
the
earth
beside
the
grave
his
arms
about
the
low
mound
his
lips
pressed
against
the
grass
with
which
it
was
covered
the
grief
of
nearly
twenty
years
rose
again
within
his
heart
and
overflowed
irresistible
violent
passionate
there
was
no
one
to
see
no
one
to
hear
vanamee
had
no
thought
of
restraint
he
no
longer
wrestled
with
his
pain
strove
against
it
there
was
even
a
sense
of
relief
in
permitting
himself
to
be
overcome
but
the
reaction
from
this
outburst
was
equally
violent
his
revolt
against
the
inevitable
his
protest
against
the
grave
shook
him
from
head
to
foot
goaded
him
beyond
all
bounds
of
reason
hounded
him
on
and
into
the
domain
of
hysteria
dementia
vanamee
was
no
longer
master
of
himself
no
longer
knew
what
he
was
doing
at
first
he
had
been
content
with
merely
a
wild
unreasoned
cry
to
heaven
that
angele
should
be
restored
to
him
but
the
vast
egotism
that
seems
to
run
through
all
forms
of
disordered
intelligence
gave
his
fancy
another
turn
he
forgot
god
he
no
longer
reckoned
with
heaven
he
arrogated
their
powers
to
himself
struggled
to
be
of
his
own
unaided
might
stronger
than
death
more
powerful
than
the
grave
he
had
demanded
of
sarria
that
god
should
restore
angele
to
him
but
now
he
appealed
directly
to
angele
herself
as
he
lay
there
his
arms
clasped
about
her
grave
she
seemed
so
near
to
him
that
he
fancied
she
must
hear
and
suddenly
at
this
moment
his
recollection
of
his
strange
compelling
power
the
same
power
by
which
he
had
called
presley
to
him
across
the
quien
sabe
ranch
the
same
power
which
had
brought
sarria
to
his
side
that
very
evening
recurred
to
him
concentrating
his
mind
upon
the
one
object
with
which
it
had
so
long
been
filled
vanamee
his
eyes
closed
his
face
buried
in
his
arms
exclaimed
come
to
me
angele
do
you
hear
come
to
but
the
answer
was
not
in
the
grave
below
him
the
voiceless
earth
lay
silent
moveless
withholding
the
secret
jealous
of
that
which
it
held
so
close
in
its
grip
refusing
to
give
up
that
which
had
been
confided
to
its
keeping
untouched
by
the
human
anguish
that
above
there
on
its
surface
clutched
with
despairing
hands
at
a
grave
long
made
the
earth
that
only
that
morning
had
been
so
eager
so
responsive
to
the
lightest
summons
so
vibrant
with
life
now
at
night
holding
death
within
its
embrace
guarding
inviolate
the
secret
of
the
grave
was
deaf
to
all
entreaty
refused
the
answer
and
angele
remained
as
before
only
a
memory
far
distant
intangible
lost
vanamee
lifted
his
head
looking
about
him
with
unseeing
eyes
trembling
with
the
exertion
of
his
vain
effort
but
he
could
not
as
yet
allow
himself
to
despair
never
before
had
that
curious
power
of
attraction
failed
him
he
felt
himself
to
be
so
strong
in
this
respect
that
he
was
persuaded
if
he
exerted
himself
to
the
limit
of
his
capacity
something
he
could
not
say
what
must
come
of
it
if
it
was
only
a
an
hallucination
he
told
himself
that
he
would
be
content
almost
of
its
own
accord
his
distorted
mind
concentrated
itself
again
every
thought
all
the
power
of
his
will
riveting
themselves
upon
angele
as
if
she
were
alive
he
summoned
her
to
him
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
name
cut
into
the
headstone
contracted
the
pupils
growing
small
his
fists
shut
tight
his
nerves
braced
rigid
for
a
few
seconds
he
stood
thus
breathless
expectant
awaiting
the
manifestation
the
miracle
then
without
knowing
why
hardly
conscious
of
what
was
transpiring
he
found
that
his
glance
was
leaving
the
headstone
was
turning
from
the
grave
not
only
this
but
his
whole
body
was
following
the
direction
of
his
eyes
before
he
knew
it
he
was
standing
with
his
back
to
angele
grave
was
facing
the
north
facing
the
line
of
pear
trees
and
the
little
valley
where
the
seed
ranch
lay
at
first
he
thought
this
was
because
he
had
allowed
his
will
to
weaken
the
concentrated
power
of
his
mind
to
grow
slack
and
once
more
turning
toward
the
grave
he
banded
all
his
thoughts
together
in
a
consummate
effort
his
teeth
grinding
together
his
hands
pressed
to
his
forehead
he
forced
himself
to
the
notion
that
angele
was
alive
and
to
this
creature
of
his
imagination
he
addressed
himself
angele
he
cried
in
a
low
voice
angele
i
am
calling
you
do
you
hear
come
to
me
come
to
me
now
instead
of
the
answer
he
demanded
that
inexplicable
cut
across
the
current
of
his
thought
strive
as
he
would
against
it
he
must
veer
to
the
north
toward
the
pear
trees
obeying
it
he
turned
and
still
wondering
took
a
step
in
that
direction
then
another
and
another
the
next
moment
he
came
abruptly
to
himself
in
the
black
shadow
of
the
pear
trees
themselves
and
opening
his
eyes
found
himself
looking
off
over
the
seed
ranch
toward
the
little
house
in
the
centre
where
angele
had
once
lived
perplexed
he
returned
to
the
grave
once
more
calling
upon
the
resources
of
his
will
and
abruptly
so
soon
as
these
reached
a
certain
point
the
same
set
in
he
could
no
longer
keep
his
eyes
upon
the
headstone
could
no
longer
think
of
the
grave
and
what
it
held
he
must
face
the
north
he
must
be
drawn
toward
the
pear
trees
and
there
left
standing
in
their
shadow
looking
out
aimlessly
over
the
seed
ranch
wondering
bewildered
farther
than
this
the
influence
never
drew
him
but
up
to
this
point
the
line
of
pear
trees
it
was
not
to
be
resisted
for
a
time
the
peculiarity
of
the
affair
was
of
more
interest
to
vanamee
than
even
his
own
distress
of
spirit
and
once
or
twice
he
repeated
the
attempt
almost
experimentally
and
invariably
with
the
same
result
so
soon
as
he
seemed
to
hold
angele
in
the
grip
of
his
mind
he
was
moved
to
turn
about
toward
the
north
and
hurry
toward
the
pear
trees
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
that
the
little
valley
but
vanamee
unhappiness
was
too
keen
this
night
for
him
to
dwell
long
upon
the
vagaries
of
his
mind
submitting
at
length
and
abandoning
the
grave
he
flung
himself
down
in
the
black
shade
of
the
pear
trees
his
chin
in
his
hands
and
resigned
himself
finally
and
definitely
to
the
inrush
of
recollection
and
the
exquisite
grief
of
an
infinite
regret
to
his
fancy
she
came
to
him
again
he
put
himself
back
many
years
he
remembered
the
warm
nights
of
july
and
august
profoundly
still
the
sky
encrusted
with
stars
the
little
mission
garden
exhaling
the
mingled
perfumes
that
all
through
the
scorching
day
had
been
distilled
under
the
steady
blaze
of
a
summer
sun
he
saw
himself
as
another
person
arriving
at
this
their
rendezvous
all
day
long
she
had
been
in
his
mind
all
day
long
he
had
looked
forward
to
this
quiet
hour
that
belonged
to
her
it
was
dark
he
could
see
nothing
but
by
and
by
he
heard
a
step
a
gentle
rustle
of
the
grass
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
pressed
under
an
advancing
foot
then
he
saw
the
faint
gleam
of
pallid
gold
of
her
hair
a
barely
visible
glow
in
the
starlight
and
heard
the
murmur
of
her
breath
in
the
lapse
of
the
breeze
and
then
in
the
midst
of
the
gentle
perfumes
of
the
garden
the
perfumes
of
the
magnolia
flowers
of
the
mignonette
borders
of
the
crumbling
walls
there
expanded
a
new
odour
or
the
faint
mingling
of
many
odours
the
smell
of
the
roses
that
lingered
in
her
hair
of
the
lilies
that
exhaled
from
her
neck
of
the
heliotrope
that
disengaged
itself
from
her
hands
and
arms
and
of
the
hyacinths
with
which
her
little
feet
were
redolent
and
then
suddenly
it
was
herself
her
eyes
violet
blue
full
of
the
love
of
him
her
sweet
full
lips
speaking
his
name
her
hands
clasping
his
hands
his
shoulders
his
neck
her
whole
dear
body
giving
itself
into
his
embrace
her
lips
against
his
her
hands
holding
his
head
drawing
his
face
down
to
hers
vanamee
as
he
remembered
all
this
flung
out
an
arm
with
a
cry
of
pain
his
eyes
searching
the
gloom
all
his
mind
in
strenuous
mutiny
against
the
triumph
of
death
his
glance
shot
swiftly
out
across
the
night
unconsciously
following
the
direction
from
which
angele
used
to
come
to
him
come
to
me
now
he
exclaimed
under
his
breath
tense
and
rigid
with
the
vast
futile
effort
of
his
will
come
to
me
now
now
do
you
hear
me
angele
you
must
you
must
suddenly
vanamee
returned
to
himself
with
the
abruptness
of
a
blow
his
eyes
opened
he
half
raised
himself
from
the
ground
swiftly
his
scattered
wits
readjusted
themselves
never
more
sane
never
more
himself
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
stood
looking
off
into
the
night
across
the
seed
ranch
what
was
it
he
murmured
bewildered
he
looked
around
him
from
side
to
side
as
if
to
get
in
touch
with
reality
once
more
he
looked
at
his
hands
at
the
rough
bark
of
the
pear
tree
next
which
he
stood
at
the
streaked
and
walls
of
the
mission
and
garden
the
exaltation
of
his
mind
calmed
itself
the
unnatural
strain
under
which
he
laboured
slackened
he
became
thoroughly
master
of
himself
again
practical
keen
but
just
so
sure
as
his
hands
were
his
own
just
so
sure
as
the
bark
of
the
pear
tree
was
rough
the
mouldering
adobe
of
the
mission
walls
damp
just
so
sure
had
something
occurred
it
was
vague
intangible
appealing
only
to
some
strange
nameless
sixth
sense
but
none
the
less
perceptible
his
mind
his
imagination
sent
out
from
him
across
the
night
across
the
little
valley
below
him
speeding
hither
and
thither
through
the
dark
lost
confused
had
suddenly
paused
hovering
had
found
something
it
had
not
returned
to
him
it
had
come
back
but
now
there
was
a
change
mysterious
illusive
there
were
no
words
for
this
that
had
transpired
but
for
the
moment
one
thing
only
was
certain
the
night
was
no
longer
voiceless
the
dark
was
no
longer
empty
far
off
there
beyond
the
reach
of
vision
unlocalised
strange
a
ripple
had
formed
on
the
still
black
pool
of
the
night
had
formed
flashed
one
instant
to
the
stars
then
swiftly
faded
again
the
night
shut
down
once
more
there
was
no
sound
nothing
stirred
for
the
moment
vanamee
stood
transfixed
struck
rigid
in
his
place
stupefied
his
eyes
staring
breathless
with
utter
amazement
then
step
by
step
he
shrank
back
into
the
deeper
shadow
treading
with
the
infinite
precaution
of
a
prowling
leopard
a
qualm
of
something
very
much
like
fear
seized
upon
him
but
immediately
on
the
heels
of
this
first
impression
came
the
doubt
of
his
own
senses
whatever
had
happened
had
been
so
ephemeral
so
faint
so
intangible
that
now
he
wondered
if
he
had
not
deceived
himself
after
all
but
the
reaction
followed
surely
there
had
been
something
and
from
that
moment
began
for
him
the
most
poignant
uncertainty
of
mind
gradually
he
drew
back
into
the
garden
holding
his
breath
listening
to
every
faintest
sound
walking
upon
tiptoe
he
reached
the
fountain
and
wetting
his
hands
passed
them
across
his
forehead
and
eyes
once
more
he
stood
listening
the
silence
was
profound
troubled
disturbed
vanamee
went
away
passing
out
of
the
garden
descending
the
hill
he
forded
broderson
creek
where
it
intersected
the
road
to
guadalajara
and
went
on
across
quien
sabe
walking
slowly
his
head
bent
down
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
thoughtful
perplexed
chapter
v
at
seven
in
the
bedroom
of
his
ranch
house
in
the
iron
bedstead
with
its
army
blankets
and
red
counterpane
annixter
was
still
asleep
his
face
red
his
mouth
open
his
stiff
yellow
hair
in
wild
disorder
on
the
wooden
chair
at
the
stood
the
kerosene
lamp
by
the
light
of
which
he
had
been
reading
the
previous
evening
beside
it
was
a
paper
bag
of
dried
prunes
and
the
limp
volume
of
copperfield
the
place
marked
by
a
slip
of
paper
torn
from
the
edge
of
the
bag
annixter
slept
soundly
making
great
work
of
the
business
unable
to
take
even
his
rest
gracefully
his
eyes
were
shut
so
tight
that
the
skin
at
their
angles
was
drawn
into
puckers
under
his
pillow
his
two
hands
were
doubled
up
into
fists
at
intervals
he
gritted
his
teeth
ferociously
while
from
time
to
time
the
abrupt
sound
of
his
snoring
dominated
the
brisk
ticking
of
the
alarm
clock
that
hung
from
the
brass
knob
of
the
within
six
inches
of
his
ear
but
immediately
after
seven
this
clock
sprung
its
alarm
with
the
abruptness
of
an
explosion
and
within
the
second
annixter
had
hurled
the
from
him
and
flung
himself
up
to
a
sitting
posture
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
panting
and
gasping
blinking
at
the
light
rubbing
his
head
dazed
and
bewildered
stupefied
at
the
hideous
suddenness
with
which
he
had
been
wrenched
from
his
sleep
his
first
act
was
to
take
down
the
alarm
clock
and
stifle
its
prolonged
whirring
under
the
pillows
and
blankets
but
when
this
had
been
done
he
continued
to
sit
stupidly
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
curling
his
toes
away
from
the
cold
of
the
floor
his
eyes
heavy
with
sleep
fixed
and
vacant
closing
and
opening
by
turns
for
upwards
of
three
minutes
he
alternately
dozed
and
woke
his
head
and
the
whole
upper
half
of
his
body
sagging
abruptly
sideways
from
moment
to
moment
but
at
length
coming
more
to
himself
he
straightened
up
ran
his
fingers
through
his
hair
and
with
a
prodigious
yawn
murmured
vaguely
oh
lord
lord
he
stretched
three
or
four
times
twisting
about
in
his
place
curling
and
uncurling
his
toes
muttering
from
time
to
time
between
two
yawns
oh
lord
oh
lord
he
stared
about
the
room
collecting
his
thoughts
readjusting
himself
for
the
day
work
the
room
was
barren
the
walls
of
sheathing
alternate
brown
and
yellow
boards
like
the
walls
of
a
stable
were
adorned
with
two
or
three
unframed
lithographs
the
christmas
souvenirs
of
weekly
periodicals
fastened
with
great
wire
nails
a
bunch
of
herbs
or
flowers
lamentably
withered
and
grey
with
dust
was
affixed
to
the
mirror
over
the
black
walnut
washstand
by
the
window
and
a
yellowed
photograph
of
annixter
combined
harvester
himself
and
his
men
in
a
group
before
it
hung
close
at
hand
on
the
floor
at
the
bedside
and
before
the
bureau
were
two
oval
rugs
in
the
corners
of
the
room
were
muddy
boots
a
mcclellan
saddle
a
surveyor
transit
an
empty
and
a
box
of
iron
bolts
and
nuts
on
the
wall
over
the
bed
in
a
gilt
frame
was
annixter
college
diploma
while
on
the
bureau
amid
a
litter
of
dirty
collars
driving
gloves
cigars
and
the
like
stood
a
broken
machine
for
loading
shells
it
was
essentially
a
man
room
rugged
uncouth
virile
full
of
the
odours
of
tobacco
of
leather
of
rusty
iron
the
bare
floor
hollowed
by
the
grind
of
boots
the
walls
marred
by
the
friction
of
heavy
things
of
metal
strangely
enough
annixter
clothes
were
disposed
of
on
the
single
chair
with
the
precision
of
an
old
maid
thus
he
had
placed
them
the
night
before
the
boots
set
carefully
side
by
side
the

with
the
overalls
still
upon
them
neatly
folded
upon
the

of

the

hanging
from
its
back
the

ranch
house
was
a
affair
all
on
one
floor
by
no
excess
of
charity
could
it
have
been
called
a
home
annixter
was
a
wealthy
man
he
could
have
furnished
his
dwelling
with
quite
as
much
elegance
as
that
of
magnus
derrick
as
it
was
however
he
considered
his
house
merely
as
a
place
to
eat
to
sleep
to
change
his
clothes
in
as
a
shelter
from
the
rain
an
office
where
business
was
transacted
nothing
more
when
he
was
sufficiently
awake
annixter
thrust
his
feet
into
a
pair
of
wicker
slippers
and
shuffled
across
the
office
adjoining
his
bedroom
to
the
bathroom
just
beyond
and
stood
under
the
icy
shower
a
few
minutes
his
teeth
chattering
fulminating
oaths
at
the
coldness
of
the
water
still
shivering
he
hurried
into
his
clothes
and
having
pushed
the
button
of
the
electric
bell
to
announce
that
he
was
ready
for
breakfast
immediately
plunged
into
the
business
of
the
day
while
he
was
thus
occupied
the
butcher
cart
from
bonneville
drove
into
the
yard
with
the
day
supply
of
meat
this
cart
also
brought
the
bonneville
paper
and
the
mail
of
the
previous
night
in
the
bundle
of
correspondence
that
the
butcher
handed
to
annixter
that
morning
was
a
telegram
from
osterman
at
that
time
on
his
second
trip
to
los
angeles
it
read
flotation
of
company
in
this
district
assured
have
secured
services
of
desirable
party
am
now
in
position
to
sell
you
your
share
stock
as
per
original
annixter
grunted
as
he
tore
the
despatch
into
strips
well
he
muttered
that
part
is
settled
he
made
a
little
pile
of
the
torn
strips
on
the
top
of
the
unlighted
stove
and
burned
them
carefully
scowling
down
into
the
flicker
of
fire
thoughtful
and
preoccupied
he
knew
very
well
what
osterman
referred
to
by
flotation
of
company
and
also
who
was
the
desirable
party
he
spoke
of
under
protest
as
he
was
particular
to
declare
and
after
interminable
argument
annixter
had
allowed
himself
to
be
reconciled
with
osterman
and
to
be
persuaded
to
reenter
the
proposed
political
a
committee
had
been
formed
to
finance
the
affair
osterman
old
broderson
annixter
himself
and
with
reservations
hardly
more
than
a
harran
derrick
of
this
committee
osterman
was
considered
chairman
magnus
derrick
had
formally
and
definitely
refused
his
adherence
to
the
scheme
he
was
trying
to
steer
a
middle
course
his
position
was
difficult
anomalous
if
freight
rates
were
cut
through
the
efforts
of
the
members
of
the
committee
he
could
not
very
well
avoid
taking
advantage
of
the
new
schedule
he
would
be
the
gainer
though
sharing
neither
the
risk
nor
the
expense
but
meanwhile
the
days
were
passing
the
primary
elections
were
drawing
nearer
the
committee
could
not
afford
to
wait
and
by
way
of
a
beginning
osterman
had
gone
to
los
angeles
fortified
by
a
large
sum
of
money
a
purse
to
which
annixter
broderson
and
himself
had
contributed
he
had
put
himself
in
touch
with
disbrow
the
political
man
of
the
denver
pueblo
and
mojave
road
and
had
had
two
interviews
with
him
the
telegram
that
annixter
received
that
morning
was
to
say
that
disbrow
had
been
bought
over
and
would
adopt
parrell
as
the
and
candidate
for
railroad
commissioner
from
the
third
district
one
of
the
cooks
brought
up
annixter
breakfast
that
morning
and
he
went
through
it
hastily
reading
his
mail
at
the
same
time
and
glancing
over
the
pages
of
the
mercury
genslinger
paper
the
mercury
annixter
was
persuaded
received
a
subsidy
from
the
pacific
and
southwestern
railroad
and
was
hardly
better
than
the
mouthpiece
by
which
shelgrim
and
the
general
office
spoke
to
ranchers
about
bonneville
an
editorial
in
that
morning
issue
said
it
would
not
be
surprising
to
the
if
the
of
the
value
of
the
railroad
sections
included
in
the
los
muertos
quien
sabe
osterman
and
broderson
properties
was
made
before
the
first
of
the
year
naturally
the
tenants
of
these
lands
feel
an
interest
in
the
price
which
the
railroad
will
put
upon
its
holdings
and
it
is
rumoured
they
expect
the
land
will
be
offered
to
them
for
two
dollars
and
fifty
cents
per
acre
it
needs
no
seventh
daughter
of
a
seventh
daughter
to
foresee
that
these
gentlemen
will
be
rot
vociferated
annixter
to
himself
as
he
finished
he
rolled
the
paper
into
a
wad
and
hurled
it
from
him
rot
rot
what
does
genslinger
know
about
it
i
stand
on
my
agreement
with
the
and
from
two
fifty
to
five
dollars
an
acre
there
it
is
in
black
and
white
the
road
is
obligated
and
my
improvements
i
made
the
land
valuable
by
improving
it
irrigating
it
draining
it
and
cultivating
it
talk
to
me
i
know
the
most
abiding
impression
that
genslinger
editorial
made
upon
him
was
that
possibly
the
mercury
was
not
subsidised
by
the
corporation
after
all
if
it
was
genslinger
would
not
have
been
led
into
making
his
mistake
as
to
the
value
of
the
land
he
would
have
known
that
the
railroad
was
under
contract
to
sell
at
two
dollars
and
a
half
an
acre
and
not
only
this
but
that
when
the
land
was
put
upon
the
market
it
was
to
be
offered
to
the
present
holders
first
of
all
annixter
called
to
mind
the
explicit
terms
of
the
agreement
between
himself
and
the
railroad
and
dismissed
the
matter
from
his
mind
he
lit
a
cigar
put
on
his
hat
and
went
out
the
morning
was
fine
the
air
nimble
brisk
on
the
summit
of
the
tower
of
the
artesian
well
the
windmill
was
turning
steadily
in
a
breeze
from
the
southwest
the
water
in
the
irrigating
ditch
was
well
up
there
was
no
cloud
in
the
sky
far
off
to
the
east
and
west
the
bulwarks
of
the
valley
the
coast
range
and
the
foothills
of
the
sierras
stood
out
pale
amethyst
against
the
delicate
pink
and
white
sheen
of
the
horizon
the
sunlight
was
a
veritable
flood
crystal
limpid
sparkling
setting
a
feeling
of
gayety
in
the
air
stirring
up
an
effervescence
in
the
blood
a
tumult
of
exuberance
in
the
veins
but
on
his
way
to
the
barns
annixter
was
obliged
to
pass
by
the
open
door
of
the
hilma
tree
was
inside
singing
at
her
work
her
voice
of
a
velvety
huskiness
more
of
the
chest
than
of
the
throat
mingling
with
the
liquid
dashing
of
the
milk
in
the
vats
and
churns
and
the
clear
sonorous
clinking
of
the
cans
and
pans
annixter
turned
into
the
pausing
on
the
threshold
looking
about
him
hilma
stood
bathed
from
head
to
foot
in
the
torrent
of
sunlight
that
poured
in
upon
her
from
the
three
windows
she
was
charming
delicious
radiant
of
youth
of
health
of
into
her
eyes
wide
open
brown
rimmed
with
their
fine
thin
line
of
intense
black
lashes
the
sun
set
a
diamond
flash
the
same
golden
light
glowed
all
around
her
thick
moist
hair
lambent
beautiful
a
sheen
of
almost
metallic
lustre
and
reflected
itself
upon
her
wet
lips
moving
with
the
words
of
her
singing
the
whiteness
of
her
skin
under
the
caress
of
this
hale
vigorous
morning
light
was
dazzling
pure
of
a
fineness
beyond
words
beneath
the
sweet
modulation
of
her
chin
the
reflected
light
from
the
burnished
copper
vessel
she
was
carrying
set
a
vibration
of
pale
gold
overlaying
the
flush
of
rose
in
her
cheeks
seen
only
when
she
stood
against
the
sunlight
was
a
faint
sheen
of
down
a
lustrous
floss
delicate
as
the
pollen
of
a
flower
or
the
impalpable
powder
of
a
wing
she
was
moving
to
and
fro
about
her
work
alert
joyous
robust
and
from
all
the
fine
full
amplitude
of
her
figure
from
her
thick
white
neck
sloping
downward
to
her
shoulders
from
the
deep
feminine
swell
of
her
breast
the
vigorous
maturity
of
her
hips
there
was
disengaged
a
vibrant
note
of
gayety
of
exuberant
animal
life
sane
honest
strong
she
wore
a
skirt
of
plain
blue
calico
and
a
shirtwaist
of
pink
linen
clean
trim
while
her
sleeves
turned
back
to
her
shoulders
showed
her
large
white
arms
wet
with
milk
redolent
and
fragrant
with
milk
glowing
and
resplendent
in
the
early
morning
light
on
the
threshold
annixter
took
off
his
hat
good
morning
miss
hilma
who
had
set
down
the
copper
can
on
top
of
the
vat
turned
about
quickly
oh
good
morning
sir
and
unconsciously
she
made
a
little
gesture
of
salutation
with
her
hand
raising
it
part
way
toward
her
head
as
a
man
would
have
done
well
began
annixter
vaguely
how
are
you
getting
along
down
here
oh
very
fine
there
is
not
so
much
to
do
we
drew
the
whey

ago
and
now

are
just
done
putting
the
curd

press

my
pans
would

copper
things

have
scrubbed
and
scrubbed
oh
you
can
look
into
the
tiniest
corners
everywhere
you
wo
find
so
much
as
the
littlest
speck
of
dirt
or
grease
i
love
clean
things
and
this
room
is
my
own
particular
place
here
i
can
do
just
as
i
please
and
that
is
to
keep
the
cement
floor
and
the
vats
and
the
churns
and
the
separators
and
especially
the
cans
and
coppers
clean
clean
and
to
see
that
the
milk

that
a
little
baby
could
drink
it
and
to
have
the
air
always
sweet
and
the
sun
oh
lots
and
lots
of
sun
morning
noon
and
afternoon
so
that
everything
shines
you
know
i
never
see
the
sun
set
that
it
do
make
me
a
little
sad
yes
always
just
a
little
it
funny
i
should
want
it
to
be
day
all
the
time
and
when
the
day
is
gloomy
and
dark
i
am
just
as
sad
as
if
a
very
good
friend
of
mine
had
left
me
would
you
believe
it
just
until
within
a
few
years
when
i
was
a
big
girl
sixteen
and
over
mamma
had
to
sit
by
my
bed
every
night
before
i
could
go
to
sleep
i
was
afraid
in
the
dark
sometimes
i
am
now
just
imagine
and
now
i
am
nineteen
a
young
you
were
hey
observed
annixter
for
the
sake
of
saying
something
afraid
in
the
dark
what
of
ghosts
i
do
know
what
i
wanted
the
light
i
wanted
she
drew
a
deep
breath
turning
towards
the
window
and
spreading
her
pink
to
the
light
oh
the
sun
i
love
the
sun
see
put
your
hand
there
here
on
the
top
of
the
vat
like
that
is
it
warm
it
fine
and
do
you
love
to
see
it
coming
in
like
that
through
the
windows
floods
of
it
and
all
the
little
dust
in
it
shining
where
there
is
lots
of
sunlight
i
think
the
people
must
be
very
good
only
wicked
people
that
love
the
dark
and
the
wicked
things
are
always
done
and
planned
in
the
dark
i
think
perhaps
too
that
why
i
hate
things
that
are
mysterious
things
that
i
ca
see
that
happen
in
the
she
wrinkled
her
nose
with
a
little
expression
of
aversion
i
hate
a
mystery
maybe
that
why
i
am
afraid
in
the
dark
or
was
i
should
like
to
think
that
anything
could
happen
around
me
that
i
could
see
or
understand
or
she
ran
on
from
subject
to
subject
positively
garrulous
talking
in
her
voice
of
velvety
huskiness
for
the
mere
enjoyment
of
putting
her
ideas
into
speech
innocently
assuming
that
they
were
quite
as
interesting
to
others
as
to
herself
she
was
yet
a
great
child
ignoring
the
fact
that
she
had
ever
grown
up
taking
a
child
interest
in
her
immediate
surroundings
direct
straightforward
plain
while
speaking
she
continued
about
her
work
rinsing
out
the
cans
with
a
mixture
of
hot
water
and
soda
scouring
them
bright
and
piling
them
in
the
sunlight
on
top
of
the
vat
obliquely
and
from
between
his
narrowed
lids
annixter
scrutinised
her
from
time
to
time
more
and
more
won
over
by
her
adorable
freshness
her
clean
fine
youth
the
clumsiness
that
he
usually
experienced
in
the
presence
of
women
was
wearing
off
hilma
tree
direct
simplicity
put
him
at
his
ease
he
began
to
wonder
if
he
dared
to
kiss
hilma
and
if
he
did
dare
how
she
would
take
it
a
spark
of
suspicion
flickered
up
in
his
mind
did
not
her
manner
imply
vaguely
an
invitation
one
never
could
tell
with
feemales
that
was
why
she
was
talking
so
much
no
doubt
holding
him
there
affording
the
opportunity
aha
she
had
best
look
out
or
he
would
take
her
at
her
word
oh
i
had
forgotten
suddenly
exclaimed
hilma
the
very
thing
i
wanted
to
show
you
the
new
press
you
remember
i
asked
for
one
last
month
this
is
it
see
this
is
how
it
works
here
is
where
the
curds
go
look
and
this
cover
is
screwed
down
like
this
and
then
you
work
the
lever
this
she
grasped
the
lever
in
both
hands
throwing
her
weight
upon
it
her
smooth
bare
arm
swelling
round
and
firm
with
the
effort
one
slim
foot
in
its
low
shoe
set
off
with
the
bright
steel
buckle
braced
against
the
wall
my
but
that
takes
strength
she
panted
looking
up
at
him
and
smiling
but
is
it
a
fine
press
just
what
we
and
annixter
cleared
his
throat
and
where
do
you
keep
the
cheeses
and
the
butter
he
thought
it
very
likely
that
these
were
in
the
cellar
of
the
dairy
in
the
cellar
answered
hilma
down
here
see
she
raised
the
flap
of
the
cellar
door
at
the
end
of
the
room
would
you
like
to
see
come
down
i
show
she
went
before
him
down
into
the
cool
obscurity
underneath
redolent
of
new
cheese
and
fresh
butter
annixter
followed
a
certain
excitement
beginning
to
gain
upon
him
he
was
almost
sure
now
that
hilma
wanted
him
to
kiss
her
at
all
events
one
could
but
try
but
as
yet
he
was
not
absolutely
sure
suppose
he
had
been
mistaken
in
her
suppose
she
should
consider
herself
insulted
and
freeze
him
with
an
icy
stare
annixter
winced
at
the
very
thought
of
it
better
let
the
whole
business
go
and
get
to
work
he
was
wasting
half
the
morning
yet
if
she
did
want
to
give
him
the
opportunity
of
kissing
her
and
he
failed
to
take
advantage
of
it
what
a
ninny
she
would
think
him
she
would
despise
him
for
being
afraid
he
afraid
he
annixter
afraid
of
a
fool
feemale
girl
why
he
owed
it
to
himself
as
a
man
to
go
as
far
as
he
could
he
told
himself
that
that
goat
osterman
would
have
kissed
hilma
tree
weeks
ago
to
test
his
state
of
mind
he
imagined
himself
as
having
decided
to
kiss
her
after
all
and
at
once
was
surprised
to
experience
a
poignant
qualm
of
excitement
his
heart
beating
heavily
his
breath
coming
short
at
the
same
time
his
courage
remained
with
him
he
was
not
afraid
to
try
he
felt
a
greater
respect
for
himself
because
of
this
his
hardened
within
him
and
as
hilma
turned
to
him
asking
him
to
taste
a
cut
from
one
of
the
ripe
cheeses
he
suddenly
stepped
close
to
her
throwing
an
arm
about
her
shoulders
advancing
his
head
but
at
the
last
second
he
bungled
hesitated
hilma
shrank
from
him
supple
as
a
young
reed
annixter
clutched
harshly
at
her
arm
and
trod
his
full
weight
upon
one
of
her
slender
feet
his
cheek
and
chin
barely
touching
the
delicate
pink
lobe
of
one
of
her
ears
his
lips
brushing
merely
a
fold
of
her
shirt
waist
between
neck
and
shoulder
the
thing
was
a
failure
and
at
once
he
realised
that
nothing
had
been
further
from
hilma
mind
than
the
idea
of
his
kissing
her
she
started
back
from
him
abruptly
her
hands
nervously
clasped
against
her
breast
drawing
in
her
breath
sharply
and
holding
it
with
a
little
tremulous
catch
of
the
throat
that
sent
a
quivering
vibration
the
length
of
her
smooth
white
neck
her
eyes
opened
wide
with
a
childlike
look
more
of
astonishment
than
anger
she
was
surprised
out
of
all
measure
discountenanced
taken
all
aback
and
when
she
found
her
breath
gave
voice
to
a
great
oh
of
dismay
and
distress
for
an
instant
annixter
stood
awkwardly
in
his
place
ridiculous
clumsy
murmuring
over
and
over
again
well
well
that
all
right
who
going
to
hurt
you
you
need
be
afraid
who
going
to
hurt
you
that
all
then
suddenly
with
a
quick
indefinite
gesture
of
one
arm
he
exclaimed
i
i
he
turned
away
striding
up
the
stairs
crossing
the
and
regained
the
open
air
raging
and
furious
he
turned
toward
the
barns
clapping
his
hat
upon
his
head
muttering
the
while
under
his
breath
oh
you
goat
you
beastly
fool
pip
good
lord
what
an
ass
you
made
of
yourself
now
suddenly
he
resolved
to
put
hilma
tree
out
of
his
thoughts
the
matter
was
interfering
with
his
work
this
kind
of
thing
was
sure
not
earning
any
money
he
shook
himself
as
though
freeing
his
shoulders
of
an
irksome
burden
and
turned
his
entire
attention
to
the
work
nearest
at
hand
the
prolonged
rattle
of
the
shinglers
hammers
upon
the
roof
of
the
big
barn
attracted
him
and
crossing
over
between
the
ranch
house
and
the
artesian
well
he
stood
for
some
time
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
the
vast
building
amused
and
interested
with
the
confusion
of
sounds
the
clatter
of
hammers
the
cadenced
scrape
of
saws
and
the
rhythmic
shuffle
of
planes
that
issued
from
the
gang
of
carpenters
who
were
at
that
moment
putting
the
finishing
touches
upon
the
roof
and
rows
of
stalls
a
boy
and
two
men
were
busy
hanging
the
great
sliding
door
at
the
south
end
while
the
painters
come
down
from
bonneville
early
that
morning
were
engaged
in
adjusting
the
spray
and
force
engine
by
means
of
which
annixter
had
insisted
upon
painting
the
vast
surfaces
of
the
barn
condemning
the
use
of
brushes
and
pots
for
such
work
as
and
he
called
to
one
of
the
foremen
to
ask
when
the
barn
would
be
entirely
finished
and
was
told
that
at
the
end
of
the
week
the
hay
and
stock
could
be
installed
and
a
precious
long
time
you
been
at
it
too
annixter
declared
well
you
know
the
rain
oh
rot
the
rain
i
work
in
the
rain
you
and
your
unions
make
me
but
annixter
we
could
have
begun
painting
in
the
rain
the
job
would
have
been
hoh
yes
spoiled
that
all
very
well
maybe
it
would
and
then
again
maybe
it
but
when
the
foreman
had
left
him
annixter
could
not
forbear
a
growl
of
satisfaction
it
could
not
be
denied
that
the
barn
was
superb
monumental
even
almost
any
one
of
the
other
barns
in
the
county
could
be
swung
fashion
inside
of
it
with
room
to
spare
in
every
sense
the
barn
was
precisely
what
annixter
had
hoped
of
it
in
his
pleasure
over
the
success
of
his
idea
even
hilma
for
the
moment
was
forgotten
and
now
murmured
annixter
i
give
that
dance
in
it
i
make
sit
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
better
set
about
sending
out
the
invitations
for
the
affair
he
was
puzzled
to
decide
just
how
the
thing
should
be
managed
and
resolved
that
it
might
be
as
well
to
consult
magnus
and
derrick
i
want
to
talk
of
this
telegram
of
the
goat
with
magnus
anyhow
he
said
to
himself
reflectively
and
there
things
i
got
to
do
in
bonneville
before
the
first
of
the
he
turned
about
on
his
heel
with
a
last
look
at
the
barn
and
set
off
toward
the
stable
he
had
decided
to
have
his
horse
saddled
and
ride
over
to
bonneville
by
way
of
los
muertos
he
would
make
a
day
of
it
would
see
magnus
harran
old
broderson
and
some
of
the
business
men
of
bonneville
a
few
moments
later
he
rode
out
of
the
barn
and
the
a
fresh
cigar
between
his
teeth
his
hat
slanted
over
his
face
against
the
rays
of
the
sun
as
yet
low
in
the
east
he
crossed
the
irrigating
ditch
and
gained
the
trail
the
short
cut
over
into
los
muertos
by
way
of
hooven
it
led
south
and
west
into
the
low
ground
overgrown
by
willows
by
broderson
creek
at
this
time
of
the
rainy
season
a
stream
of
considerable
volume
farther
on
dipping
sharply
to
pass
underneath
the
long
trestle
of
the
railroad
on
the
other
side
of
the
right
of
way
annixter
was
obliged
to
open
the
gate
in
derrick
line
fence
he
managed
this
without
dismounting
swearing
at
the
horse
the
while
and
spurring
him
continually
but
once
inside
the
gate
he
cantered
forward
briskly
this
part
of
los
muertos
was
hooven
holding
some
five
hundred
acres
enclosed
between
the
irrigating
ditch
and
broderson
creek
and
half
the
way
across
annixter
came
up
with
hooven
himself
busily
at
work
replacing
a
broken
washer
in
his

hilda

cantered
on
in
a
few
moments
he
had
crossed
broderson
creek
and
had
entered
upon
the
home
ranch
of
los
muertos
ahead
of
him
but
so
far
off
that
the
greater
portion
of
its
bulk
was
below
the
horizon
he
could
see
the
derricks
home
a
roof
or
two
between
the
dull
green
of
cypress
and
eucalyptus
nothing
else
was
in
sight
the
brown
earth
smooth
unbroken
was
as
a
limitless
ocean
the
silence
was
profound
then
at
length
annixter
searching
eye
made
out
a
blur
on
the
horizon
to
the
northward
the
blur
concentrated
itself
to
a
speck
the
speck
grew
by
steady
degrees
to
a
spot
slowly
moving
a
note
of
dull
colour
barely
darker
than
the
land
but
an
inky
black
silhouette
as
it
topped
a
low
rise
of
ground
and
stood
for
a
moment
outlined
against
the
pale
blue
of
the
sky
annixter
turned
his
horse
from
the
road
and
rode
across
the
ranch
land
to
meet
this
new
object
of
interest
as
the
spot
grew
larger
it
resolved
itself
into
constituents
a
collection
of
units
its
shape
grew
irregular
fragmentary
a
disintegrated
nebulous
confusion
advanced
toward
annixter
preceded
as
he
discovered
on
nearer
approach
by
a
medley
of
faint
sounds
now
it
was
no
longer
a
spot
but
a
column
a
column
that
moved
accompanied
by
spots
as
annixter
lessened
the
distance
these
spots
resolved
themselves
into
buggies
or
men
on
horseback
that
kept
pace
with
the
advancing
column
there
were
horses
in
the
column
itself
at
first
glance
it
appeared
as
if
there
were
nothing
else
a
riderless
squadron
tramping
steadily
over
the
upturned
plough
land
of
the
ranch
but
it
drew
nearer
the
horses
were
in
lines
six
abreast
harnessed
to
machines
the
noise
increased
defined
itself
there
was
a
shout
or
two
occasionally
a
horse
blew
through
his
nostrils
with
a
prolonged
vibrating
snort
the
click
and
clink
of
metal
work
was
incessant
the
machines
throwing
off
a
continual
rattle
of
wheels
and
cogs
and
clashing
springs
the
column
approached
nearer
was
close
at
hand
the
noises
mingled
to
a
subdued
uproar
a
bewildering
confusion
the
impact
of
innumerable
hoofs
was
a
veritable
rumble
machine
after
machine
appeared
and
annixter
drawing
to
one
side
remained
for
nearly
ten
minutes
watching
and
interested
while
like
an
array
of
chariots
clattering
jostling
creaking
clashing
an
interminable
procession
machine
succeeding
machine
team
succeeding
team
bustling
hurried
magnus
derrick
grain
drills
each
with
its
eight
hoes
went
clamouring
past
like
an
advance
of
military
seeding
the
ten
thousand
acres
of
the
great
ranch
fecundating
the
living
soil
implanting
deep
in
the
dark
womb
of
the
earth
the
germ
of
life
the
sustenance
of
a
whole
world
the
food
of
an
entire
people
when
the
drills
had
passed
annixter
turned
and
rode
back
to
the
lower
road
over
the
land
now
thick
with
seed
he
did
not
wonder
that
the
seeding
on
los
muertos
seemed
to
be
hastily
conducted
magnus
and
harran
derrick
had
not
yet
been
able
to
make
up
the
time
lost
at
the
beginning
of
the
season
when
they
had
waited
so
long
for
the
ploughs
to
arrive
they
had
been
behindhand
all
the
time
on
annixter
ranch
the
land
had
not
only
been
harrowed
as
well
as
seeded
but
in
some
cases
as
well
the
labour
of
putting
in
the
vast
crop
was
over
now
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
wait
while
the
seed
silently
germinated
nothing
to
do
but
watch
for
the
wheat
to
come
up
when
annixter
reached
the
ranch
house
of
los
muertos
under
the
shade
of
the
cypress
and
eucalyptus
trees
he
found
derrick
on
the
porch
seated
in
a
long
wicker
chair
she
had
been
washing
her
hair
and
the
light
brown
locks
that
yet
retained
so
much
of
their
brightness
were
carefully
spread
in
the
sun
over
the
back
of
her
chair
annixter
could
not
but
remark
that
spite
of
her
more
than
fifty
years
annie
derrick
was
yet
rather
pretty
her
eyes
were
still
those
of
a
young
girl
just
touched
with
an
uncertain
expression
of
innocence
and
inquiry
but
as
her
glance
fell
upon
him
he
found
that
that
expression
changed
to
one
of
uneasiness
of
distrust
almost
of
aversion
the
night
before
this
after
magnus
and
his
wife
had
gone
to
bed
they
had
lain
awake
for
hours
staring
up
into
the
dark
talking
talking
magnus
had
not
long
been
able
to
keep
from
his
wife
the
news
of
the
coalition
that
was
forming
against
the
railroad
nor
the
fact
that
this
coalition
was
determined
to
gain
its
ends
by
any
means
at
its
command
he
had
told
her
of
osterman
scheme
of
a
fraudulent
election
to
seat
a
board
of
railroad
commissioners
who
should
be
nominees
of
the
farming
interests
magnus
and
his
wife
had
talked
this
matter
over
and
over
again
and
the
same
discussion
begun
immediately
after
supper
the
evening
before
had
lasted
till
far
into
the
night
at
once
annie
derrick
had
been
seized
with
a
sudden
terror
lest
magnus
after
all
should
allow
himself
to
be
persuaded
should
yield
to
the
pressure
that
was
every
day
growing
stronger
none
better
than
she
knew
the
iron
integrity
of
her
husband
character
none
better
than
she
remembered
how
his
dearest
ambition
that
of
political
preferment
had
been
thwarted
by
his
refusal
to
truckle
to
connive
to
compromise
with
his
ideas
of
right
now
at
last
there
seemed
to
be
a
change
long
continued
oppression
petty
tyranny
injustice
and
extortion
had
driven
him
to
exasperation
behrman
insults
still
rankled
he
seemed
nearly
ready
to
countenance
osterman
scheme
the
very
fact
that
he
was
willing
to
talk
of
it
to
her
so
often
and
at
such
great
length
was
proof
positive
that
it
occupied
his
mind
the
pity
of
it
the
tragedy
of
it
he
magnus
the
governor
who
had
been
so
staunch
so
rigidly
upright
so
loyal
to
his
convictions
so
bitter
in
his
denunciation
of
the
new
politics
so
scathing
in
his
attacks
on
bribery
and
corruption
in
high
places
was
it
possible
that
now
at
last
he
could
be
brought
to
withhold
his
condemnation
of
the
devious
intrigues
of
the
unscrupulous
going
on
there
under
his
very
eyes
that
magnus
should
not
command
harran
to
refrain
from
all
intercourse
with
the
conspirators
had
been
a
matter
of
vast
surprise
to
derrick
time
was
when
magnus
would
have
forbidden
his
son
to
so
much
as
recognise
a
dishonourable
man
but
besides
all
this
derrick
wife
trembled
at
the
thought
of
her
husband
and
son
engaging
in
so
desperate
a
grapple
with
the
railroad
that
great
monster
relentless
infinitely
powerful
always
it
had
issued
triumphant
from
the
fight
always
behrman
the
corporation
champion
remained
upon
the
field
as
victor
placid
unperturbed
unassailable
but
now
a
more
terrible
struggle
than
any
hitherto
loomed
menacing
over
the
rim
of
the
future
money
was
to
be
spent
like
water
personal
reputations
were
to
be
hazarded
in
the
issue
failure
meant
ruin
in
all
directions
financial
ruin
moral
ruin
ruin
of
prestige
ruin
of
character
success
to
her
mind
was
almost
impossible
annie
derrick
feared
the
railroad
at
night
when
everything
else
was
still
the
distant
roar
of
passing
trains
echoed
across
los
muertos
from
guadalajara
from
bonneville
or
from
the
long
trestle
straight
into
her
heart
at
such
moments
she
saw
very
plainly
the
galloping
terror
of
steam
and
steel
with
its
single
eye
cyclopean
red
shooting
from
horizon
to
horizon
symbol
of
a
vast
power
huge
and
terrible
the
leviathan
with
tentacles
of
steel
to
oppose
which
meant
to
be
ground
to
instant
destruction
beneath
the
clashing
wheels
no
it
was
better
to
submit
to
resign
oneself
to
the
inevitable
she
obliterated
herself
shrinking
from
the
harshness
of
the
world
striving
with
vain
hands
to
draw
her
husband
back
with
her
just
before
annixter
arrival
she
had
been
sitting
thoughtful
in
her
long
chair
an
open
volume
of
poems
turned
down
upon
her
lap
her
glance
losing
itself
in
the
immensity
of
los
muertos
that
from
the
edge
of
the
lawn
close
by
unrolled
itself
gigantic
toward
the
far
southern
horizon
wrinkled
and
serrated
after
the
season
ploughing
the
earth
hitherto
grey
with
dust
was
now
upturned
and
brown
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
it
was
empty
of
all
life
bare
mournful
absolutely
still
and
as
she
looked
there
seemed
to
her
morbid
imagination
diseased
and
disturbed
with
long
brooding
sick
with
the
monotony
of
repeated
sensation
to
be
disengaged
from
all
this
immensity
a
sense
of
a
vast
oppression
formless
disquieting
the
terror
of
sheer
bigness
grew
slowly
in
her
mind
loneliness
beyond
words
gradually
enveloped
her
she
was
lost
in
all
these
limitless
reaches
of
space
had
she
been
abandoned
in
in
an
open
boat
her
terror
could
hardly
have
been
greater
she
felt
vividly
that
certain
uncongeniality
which
when
all
is
said
forever
remains
between
humanity
and
the
earth
which
supports
it
she
recognised
the
colossal
indifference
of
nature
not
hostile
even
kindly
and
friendly
so
long
as
the
human
was
submissive
working
with
it
hurrying
along
at
its
side
in
the
mysterious
march
of
the
centuries
let
however
the
insect
rebel
strive
to
make
head
against
the
power
of
this
nature
and
at
once
it
became
relentless
a
gigantic
engine
a
vast
power
huge
terrible
a
leviathan
with
a
heart
of
steel
knowing
no
compunction
no
forgiveness
no
tolerance
crushing
out
the
human
atom
with
sound
less
calm
the
agony
of
destruction
sending
never
a
jar
never
the
faintest
tremour
through
all
that
prodigious
mechanism
of
wheels
and
cogs
such
thoughts
as
these
did
not
take
shape
distinctly
in
her
mind
she
could
not
have
told
herself
exactly
what
it
was
that
disquieted
her
she
only
received
the
vague
sensation
of
these
things
as
it
were
a
breath
of
wind
upon
her
face
confused
troublous
an
indefinite
sense
of
hostility
in
the
air
the
sound
of
hoofs
grinding
upon
the
gravel
of
the
driveway
brought
her
to
herself
again
and
withdrawing
her
gaze
from
the
empty
plain
of
los
muertos
she
saw
young
annixter
stopping
his
horse
by
the
carriage
steps
but
the
sight
of
him
only
diverted
her
mind
to
the
other
trouble
she
could
not
but
regard
him
with
aversion
he
was
one
of
the
conspirators
was
one
of
the
leaders
in
the
battle
that
impended
no
doubt
he
had
come
to
make
a
fresh
attempt
to
win
over
magnus
to
the
unholy
alliance
however
there
was
little
trace
of
enmity
in
her
greeting
her
hair
was
still
spread
like
a
broad
patch
of
back
and
she
made
that
her
excuse
for
not
getting
up
in
answer
to
annixter
embarrassed
inquiry
after
magnus
she
sent
the
chinese
cook
to
call
him
from
the
office
and
annixter
after
tying
his
horse
to
the
ring
driven
into
the
trunk
of
one
of
the
eucalyptus
trees
came
up
to
the
porch
and
taking
off
his
hat
sat
down
upon
the
steps
is
harran
anywhere
about
he
asked
i
like
to
see
harran
no
said
derrick
harran
went
to
bonneville
early
this
she
glanced
toward
annixter
nervously
without
turning
her
head
lest
she
should
disturb
her
outspread
hair
what
is
it
you
want
to
see
derrick
about
she
inquired
hastily
is
it
about
this
plan
to
elect
a
railroad
commission
magnus
does
not
approve
of
it
she
declared
with
energy
he
told
me
so
last
annixter
moved
about
awkwardly
where
he
sat
smoothing
down
with
his
hand
the
one
stiff
lock
of
yellow
hair
that
persistently
stood
up
from
his
crown
like
an
indian
at
once
his
suspicions
were
all
aroused
ah
this
feemale
woman
was
trying
to
get
a
hold
on
him
trying
to
involve
him
in
a
petticoat
mess
trying
to
cajole
him
upon
the
instant
he
became
very
crafty
an
excess
of
prudence
promptly
congealed
his
natural
impulses
in
an
actual
spasm
of
caution
he
scarcely
trusted
himself
to
speak
terrified
lest
he
should
commit
himself
to
something
he
glanced
about
apprehensively
praying
that
magnus
might
join
them
speedily
relieving
the
tension
i
came
to
see
about
giving
a
dance
in
my
new
barn
he
answered
scowling
into
the
depths
of
his
hat
as
though
reading
from
notes
he
had
concealed
there
i
wanted
to
ask
how
i
should
send
out
the
invites
i
thought
of
just
putting
an
ad
in
the
but
as
he
spoke
presley
had
come
up
behind
annixter
in
time
to
get
the
drift
of
the
conversation
and
now
observed
that
nonsense
buck
you
not
giving
a
public
ball
you
must
send
out
hello
presley
you
there
exclaimed
annixter
turning
round
the
two
shook
hands
send
out
invitations
repeated
annixter
uneasily
why
must
i
because
that
the
only
way
to
it
is
is
it
answered
annixter
perplexed
and
troubled
no
other
man
of
his
acquaintance
could
have
so
contradicted
annixter
without
provoking
a
quarrel
upon
the
instant
why
the
young
rancher
irascible
obstinate
belligerent
should
invariably
defer
to
the
poet
was
an
inconsistency
never
to
be
explained
it
was
with
great
surprise
that
derrick
heard
him
continue
well
i
suppose
you
know
what
you
talking
about
pres
must
have
written
invites
hey
of
typewritten
why
what
an
ass
you
are
buck
observed
presley
calmly
before
you
get
through
with
it
you
will
probably
insult
of
the
people
you
intend
to
invite
and
have
about
a
hundred
quarrels
on
your
hands
and
a
lawsuit
or
however
before
annixter
could
reply
magnus
came
out
on
the
porch
erect
grave
freshly
shaven
without
realising
what
he
was
doing
annixter
instinctively
rose
to
his
feet
it
was
as
though
magnus
was
a
of
an
unseen
army
and
he
a
subaltern
there
was
some
little
conversation
as
to
the
proposed
dance
and
then
annixter
found
an
excuse
for
drawing
the
governor
aside
derrick
watched
the
two
with
eyes
full
of
poignant
anxiety
as
they
slowly
paced
the
length
of
the
gravel
driveway
to
the
road
gate
and
stood
there
leaning
upon
it
talking
earnestly
magnus
tall
impassive
one
hand
in
the
breast
of
his
frock
coat
his
head
bare
his
keen
blue
eyes
fixed
upon
annixter
face
annixter
came
at
once
to
the
main
point
i
got
a
wire
from
osterman
this
morning
governor
and
well
we
got
disbrow
that
means
that
the
denver
pueblo
and
mojave
is
back
of
us
there
half
the
fight
won
first
osterman
bribed
him
i
suppose
observed
magnus
annixter
raised
a
shoulder
vexatiously
you
got
to
pay
for
what
you
get
he
returned
you
do
get
something
for
nothing
i
guess
governor
he
went
on
i
do
see
how
you
can
stay
out
of
this
business
much
longer
you
see
how
it
will
be
we
going
to
win
and
i
do
see
how
you
can
feel
that
it
right
of
you
to
let
us
do
all
the
work
and
stand
all
the
expense
there
never
been
a
movement
of
any
importance
that
went
on
around
you
that
you
were
the
leader
in
it
all
tulare
county
all
the
san
joaquin
for
that
matter
knows
you
they
want
a
leader
and
they
are
looking
to
you
i
know
how
you
feel
about
politics
nowadays
but
governor
standards
have
changed
since
your
time
everybody
plays
the
game
now
as
we
are
playing
it
the
most
honourable
men
you
ca
play
it
any
other
way
and
pshaw
if
the
right
wins
out
in
the
end
that
the
main
thing
we
want
you
in
this
thing
and
we
want
you
bad
you
been
chewing
on
this
affair
now
a
long
time
have
you
made
up
your
mind
do
you
come
in
i
tell
you
what
you
got
to
look
at
these
things
in
a
large
way
got
to
judge
by
results
well
now
what
do
you
think
do
you
come
in
magnus
glance
left
annixter
face
and
for
an
instant
sought
the
ground
his
frown
lowered
but
now
it
was
in
perplexity
rather
than
in
anger
his
mind
was
troubled
harassed
with
a
thousand
dissensions
but
one
of
magnus
strongest
instincts
one
of
his
keenest
desires
was
to
be
if
only
for
a
short
time
the
master
to
control
men
had
ever
been
his
ambition
submission
of
any
kind
his
greatest
horror
his
energy
stirred
within
him
goaded
by
the
lash
of
his
anger
his
sense
of
indignity
of
insult
oh
for
one
moment
to
be
able
to
strike
back
to
crush
his
enemy
to
defeat
the
railroad
hold
the
corporation
in
the
grip
of
his
fist
put
down
behrman
rehabilitate
himself
regain
his
to
be
once
more
powerful
to
command
to
dominate
his
thin
lips
pressed
themselves
together
the
nostrils
of
his
prominent
nose
dilated
his
erect
commanding
figure
stiffened
unconsciously
for
a
moment
he
saw
himself
controlling
the
situation
the
foremost
figure
in
his
state
feared
respected
thousands
of
men
beneath
him
his
ambition
at
length
gratified
his
career
once
apparently
brought
to
naught
completed
success
a
palpable
achievement
what
if
this
were
his
chance
after
all
come
at
last
after
all
these
years
his
chance
the
instincts
of
the
gambler
the
most
redoubtable
poker
player
of
el
dorado
county
stirred
at
the
word
chance
to
know
it
when
it
came
to
recognise
it
as
it
passed
fleet
as
a
grip
at
it
catch
at
it
blind
reckless
staking
all
upon
the
hazard
of
the
issue
that
was
genius
was
this
his
chance
all
of
a
sudden
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
but
his
honour
his
cherished
lifelong
integrity
the
unstained
purity
of
his
principles
at
this
late
date
were
they
to
be
sacrificed
could
he
now
go
counter
to
all
the
firm
built
fabric
of
his
character
how
afterward
could
he
bear
to
look
harran
and
lyman
in
the
face
and
yet
and
yet
back
swung
the
pendulum
to
neglect
his
chance
meant
failure
a
life
begun
in
promise
and
ended
in
obscurity
perhaps
in
financial
ruin
poverty
even
to
seize
it
meant
achievement
fame
influence
prestige
possibly
great
wealth
i
am
so
sorry
to
interrupt
said
derrick
as
she
came
up
i
hope
annixter
will
excuse
me
but
i
want
magnus
to
open
the
safe
for
me
i
have
lost
the
combination
and
i
must
have
some
money
phelps
is
going
into
town
and
i
want
him
to
pay
some
bills
for
me
ca
you
come
right
away
magnus
phelps
is
ready
and
annixter
struck
his
heel
into
the
ground
with
a
suppressed
oath
always
these
fool
feemale
women
came
between
him
and
his
plans
mixing
themselves
up
in
his
affairs
magnus
had
been
on
the
very
point
of
saying
something
perhaps
committing
himself
to
some
course
of
action
and
at
precisely
the
wrong
moment
his
wife
had
cut
in
the
opportunity
was
lost
the
three
returned
toward
the
ranch
house
but
before
saying
annixter
had
secured
from
magnus
a
promise
to
the
effect
that
before
coming
to
a
definite
decision
in
the
matter
under
discussion
he
would
talk
further
with
him
presley
met
him
at
the
porch
he
was
going
into
town
with
phelps
and
proposed
to
annixter
that
he
should
accompany
them
i
want
to
go
over
and
see
old
broderson
annixter
objected
but
presley
informed
him
that
broderson
had
gone
to
bonneville
earlier
in
the
morning
he
had
seen
him
go
past
in
his
buckboard
the
three
men
set
off
phelps
and
annixter
on
horseback
presley
on
his
bicycle
when
they
had
gone
derrick
sought
out
her
husband
in
the
office
of
the
ranch
house
she
was
at
her
prettiest
that
morning
her
cheeks
flushed
with
excitement
her
innocent
eyes
almost
girlish
she
had
fastened
her
hair
still
moist
with
a
black
ribbon
tied
at
the
back
of
her
head
and
the
soft
mass
of
light
brown
reached
to
below
her
waist
making
her
look
very
young
what
was
it
he
was
saying
to
you
just
now
she
exclaimed
as
she
came
through
the
gate
in
the
wire
railing
of
the
office
what
was
annixter
saying
i
know
he
was
trying
to
get
you
to
join
him
trying
to
persuade
you
to
be
dishonest
was
that
it
tell
me
magnus
was
that
it
magnus
nodded
his
wife
drew
close
to
him
putting
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
but
you
wo
will
you
you
wo
listen
to
him
again
you
wo
so
much
as
allow
him
anybody
to
even
suppose
you
would
lend
yourself
to
bribery
oh
magnus
i
do
know
what
has
come
over
you
these
last
few
weeks
why
before
this
you
would
have
been
insulted
if
any
one
thought
you
would
even
consider
anything
like
dishonesty
magnus
it
would
break
my
heart
if
you
joined
annixter
and
osterman
why
you
be
the
same
man
to
me
afterward
you
who
have
kept
yourself
so
clean
till
now
and
the
boys
what
would
lyman
say
and
harran
and
every
one
who
knows
you
and
respects
you
if
you
lowered
yourself
to
be
just
a
political
adventurer
for
a
moment
derrick
leaned
his
head
upon
his
hand
avoiding
her
gaze
at
length
he
said
drawing
a
deep
breath
i
am
troubled
annie
these
are
the
evil
days
i
have
much
upon
my
evil
days
or
not
she
insisted
promise
me
this
one
thing
that
you
will
not
join
annixter
she
had
taken
his
hand
in
both
of
hers
and
was
looking
into
his
face
her
pretty
eyes
full
of
pleading
promise
me
she
repeated
give
me
your
word
whatever
happens
let
me
always
be
able
to
be
proud
of
you
as
i
always
have
been
give
me
your
word
i
know
you
never
seriously
thought
of
joining
annixter
but
i
am
so
nervous
and
frightened
sometimes
just
to
relieve
my
mind
magnus
give
me
your
why
you
are
right
he
answered
no
i
never
thought
seriously
of
it
only
for
a
moment
i
was
ambitious
to
be
i
do
know
what
what
i
had
hoped
to
be
once
well
that
is
over
now
annie
your
husband
is
a
disappointed
give
me
your
word
she
insisted
we
can
talk
about
other
things
again
magnus
wavered
about
to
yield
to
his
better
instincts
and
to
the
entreaties
of
his
wife
he
began
to
see
how
perilously
far
he
had
gone
in
this
business
he
was
drifting
closer
to
it
every
hour
already
he
was
entangled
already
his
foot
was
caught
in
the
mesh
that
was
being
spun
sharply
he
recoiled
again
all
his
instincts
of
honesty
revolted
no
whatever
happened
he
would
preserve
his
integrity
his
wife
was
right
always
she
had
influenced
his
better
side
at
that
moment
magnus
repugnance
of
the
proposed
political
campaign
was
at
its
pitch
of
intensity
he
wondered
how
he
had
ever
allowed
himself
to
so
much
as
entertain
the
idea
of
joining
with
the
others
now
he
would
wrench
free
would
in
a
single
instant
of
power
clear
himself
of
all
compromising
relations
he
turned
to
his
wife
upon
his
lips
trembled
the
promise
she
implored
but
suddenly
there
came
to
his
mind
the
recollection
of
his
pledge
to
annixter
he
had
given
his
word
that
before
arriving
at
a
decision
he
would
have
a
last
interview
with
him
to
magnus
his
given
word
was
sacred
though
now
he
wanted
to
he
could
not
as
yet
draw
back
could
not
promise
his
wife
that
he
would
decide
to
do
right
the
matter
must
be
delayed
a
few
days
longer
lamely
he
explained
this
to
her
annie
derrick
made
but
little
response
when
he
had
done
she
kissed
his
forehead
and
went
out
of
the
room
uneasy
depressed
her
mind
thronging
with
vague
fears
leaving
magnus
before
his
office
desk
his
head
in
his
hands
thoughtful
gloomy
assaulted
by
forebodings
meanwhile
annixter
phelps
and
presley
continued
on
their
way
toward
bonneville
in
a
short
time
they
had
turned
into
the
county
road
by
the
great
and
proceeded
onward
in
the
shade
of
the
interminable
line
of
poplar
trees
the
that
stretched
along
the
roadside
bordering
the
broderson
ranch
but
as
they
drew
near
to
caraher
saloon
and
grocery
about
half
a
mile
outside
of
bonneville
they
recognised
harran
horse
tied
to
the
railing
in
front
of
it
annixter
left
the
others
and
went
in
to
see
harran
harran
he
said
when
the
two
had
sat
down
on
either
side
of
one
of
the
small
tables
you
got
to
make
up
your
mind
one
way
or
another
pretty
soon
what
are
you
going
to
do
are
you
going
to
stand
by
and
see
the
rest
of
the
committee
spending
money
by
the
bucketful
in
this
thing
and
keep
your
hands
in
your
pockets
if
we
win
you
benefit
just
as
much
as
the
rest
of
us
i
suppose
you
got
some
money
of
your
own
you
have
have
you
you
are
your
father
manager
are
you
disconcerted
at
annixter
directness
harran
stammered
an
affirmative
adding
it
hard
to
know
just
what
to
do
it
a
mean
position
for
me
buck
i
want
to
help
you
others
but
i
do
want
to
play
fair
i
do
know
how
to
play
any
other
way
i
should
like
to
have
a
line
from
the
governor
as
to
how
to
act
but
there
no
getting
a
word
out
of
him
these
days
he
seems
to
want
to
let
me
decide
for
well
look
here
put
in
annixter
suppose
you
keep
out
of
the
thing
till
it
all
over
and
then
share
and
share
alike
with
the
committee
on
campaign
harran
fell
thoughtful
his
hands
in
his
pockets
frowning
moodily
at
the
toe
of
his
boot
there
was
a
silence
then
i
do
like
to
go
it
blind
he
hazarded
i
sort
of
sharing
the
responsibility
of
what
you
do
then
i
a
silent
partner
and
then
i
do
want
to
have
any
difficulties
with
the
governor
we
always
got
along
well
together
he
would
like
it
you
know
if
i
did
anything
like
say
exclaimed
annixter
abruptly
if
the
governor
says
he
will
keep
his
hands
off
and
that
you
can
do
as
you
please
will
you
come
in
for
god
sake
let
us
ranchers
act
together
for
once
stand
in
with
each
other
in
one
without
knowing
it
annixter
had
touched
the
right
spring
i
do
know
but
what
you
right
harran
murmured
vaguely
his
sense
of
discouragement
that
feeling
of
was
never
more
oppressive
all
fair
means
had
been
tried
the
wheat
grower
was
at
last
with
his
back
to
the
wall
if
he
chose
his
own
means
of
fighting
the
responsibility
must
rest
upon
his
enemies
not
on
himself
it
the
only
way
to
accomplish
anything
he
continued
standing
in
with
each
other
well
go
ahead
and
see
what
you
can
do
if
the
governor
is
willing
i
come
in
for
my
share
of
the
campaign
that
some
sense
exclaimed
annixter
shaking
him
by
the
hand
half
the
fight
is
over
already
we
got
disbrow
you
know
and
the
next
thing
is
to
get
hold
of
some
of
those
rotten
san
francisco
bosses
osterman
will
but
harran
interrupted
him
making
a
quick
gesture
with
his
hand
do
tell
me
about
it
he
said
i
do
want
to
know
what
you
and
osterman
are
going
to
do
if
i
did
i
should
come
yet
for
all
this
before
they
said
annixter
had
obtained
harran
promise
that
he
would
attend
the
next
meeting
of
the
committee
when
osterman
should
return
from
los
angeles
and
make
his
report
harran
went
on
toward
los
muertos
annixter
mounted
and
rode
into
bonneville
bonneville
was
very
lively
at
all
times
it
was
a
little
city
of
some
twenty
or
thirty
thousand
inhabitants
where
as
yet
the
city
hall
the
high
school
building
and
the
opera
house
were
objects
of
civic
pride
it
was
well
governed
beautifully
clean
full
of
the
energy
and
strenuous
young
life
of
a
new
city
an
air
of
the
briskest
activity
pervaded
its
streets
and
sidewalks
the
business
portion
of
the
town
centring
about
main
street
was
always
crowded
annixter
arriving
at
the
post
office
found
himself
involved
in
a
scene
of
swiftly
shifting
sights
and
sounds
saddle

farm
wagons
the
inevitable
studebakers
buggies
grey
with
the
dust
of

with

stowed
under
the

sulkies
and

were
hitched
to
the
gnawed
railings
and
telegraph
poles
along
the
curb
here
and
there
on
the
edge
of
the
sidewalk
were
bicycles
wedged
into
bicycle
racks
painted
with
cigar
advertisements
upon
the
asphalt
sidewalk
itself
soft
and
sticky
with
the
morning
heat
was
a
continuous
movement
men
with
large

wearing

coats
but
no
vests
laboured
ponderously
up
and
down
girls
in

and

went
to

invariably
in
couples
coming
in

out
of

the

under

young
men
in

with
brown
wicker
over
their

and
pencils
behind
their

bustled
in
front
of
the
grocery

anxious
and
preoccupied
a
very
old
man
a
mexican
in
ragged
white
trousers
and
bare

sat
on
a
in

of
the
barber

holding
a
horse
by
a
rope
around
its
neck
a
chinaman
went
by
teetering
under
the
weight
of
his

slung
on
a

across
his

up
the

its
two

three
passengers
a
very
narrow
wagon
belonging
to
the
cole
colemore
harvester
works
went
by
loaded
with
long
strips
of
iron
that
made
a
horrible
din
as
they
jarred
over
the
unevenness
of
the
pavement
the
electric
car
line
the
city
boast
did
a
brisk
business
its
cars
whirring
from

of

with
a
jangling
of
bells
and
a
moaning
plaint
of
gearing
on
the
stone
bulkheads
of
the
grass
plat
around
the
new

hall
the
usual
loafers
sat
chewing

in

were
the
inevitable
array
of
nursemaids
skylarking

and
ragged
little
boys
a

policeman
in
grey
coat
and
helmet
friend
and
acquaintance
of
every
man
and
woman
in
the
town
stood
by
the
park
entrance
leaning
an
elbow
on
the
fence
post
twirling
his
club
but
in
the
centre
of
the
best
business
block
of
the
street
was
a
building
of
rough
brown
stone
set
off
with
plate
glass
windows
and
signs
one
of
these

while
another
much
smaller
beneath
the
windows
of
the
second
story
bore
the
inscription
p
and
land
annixter
hitched
his
horse
to
the
iron
post
in
front
of
this
building
and
tramped
up
to
the
second
floor
letting
himself
into
an
office
where
a
couple
of
clerks
and
bookkeepers
sat
at
work
behind
a
high
wire
screen
one
of
these
latter
recognised
him
and
came
forward
hello
said
annixter
abruptly
scowling
the
while
is
your
boss
in
is
ruggles
in
the
bookkeeper
led
annixter
to
the
private
office
in
an
adjoining
room
ushering
him
through
a
door
on
the
frosted
glass
of
which
was
painted
the
name
cyrus
blakelee
inside
a
man
in
a
frock
coat
shoestring
necktie
and
stetson
hat
sat
writing
at
a
desk
over
this
desk
was
a
vast
map
of
the
railroad
holdings
in
the
country
about
bonneville
and
guadalajara
the
alternate
sections
belonging
to
the
corporation
accurately
plotted
ruggles
was
cordial
in
his
welcome
of
annixter
he
had
a
way
of
fiddling
with
his
pencil
continually
while
he
talked
scribbling
vague
lines
and
fragments
of
words
and
names
on
stray
bits
of
paper
and
no
sooner
had
annixter
sat
down
than
he
had
begun
to
write
in
script
ann
ann
all
over
his
blotting
pad
i
want
to
see
about
those
lands
of
mine
i
mean
of
yours
of
the
railroad
annixter
commenced
at
once
i
want
to
know
when
i
can
buy
i
sick
of
fooling
along
like
well
annixter
observed
ruggles
writing
a
great
l
before
the
ann
and
finishing
it
off
with
a
flourishing
the
lands
he
crossed
out
one
of
the
n
and
noted
the
effect
with
a
hasty
glance
the
lands
are
practically
yours
you
have
an
option
on
them
indefinitely
and
as
it
is
you
do
have
to
pay
the
rot
your
option
i
want
to
own
them
annixter
declared
what
have
you
people
got
to
gain
by
putting
off
selling
them
to
us
here
this
thing
has
dragged
along
for
over
eight
years
when
i
came
in
on
quien
sabe
the
understanding
was
that
the
lands
your
alternate
sections
were
to
be
conveyed
to
me
within
a
few
the
land
had
not
been
patented
to
us
then
answered
ruggles
well
it
has
been
now
i
guess
retorted
annixter
i
sure
i
could
tell
you
annixter
crossed
his
legs
weariedly
oh
what
the
good
of
lying
ruggles
you
know
better
than
to
talk
that
way
to
ruggles
face
flushed
on
the
instant
but
he
checked
his
answer
and
laughed
instead
oh
if
you
know
so
much
about
it
he
observed
well
when
are
you
going
to
sell
to
me
i
only
acting
for
the
general
office
annixter
returned
ruggles
whenever
the
directors
are
ready
to
take
that
matter
up
be
only
too
glad
to
put
it
through
for
as
if
you
did
know
look
here
you
not
talking
to
old
broderson
wake
up
ruggles
what
all
this
talk
in
genslinger
rag
about
the
grading
of
the
value
of
our
lands
this
winter
and
an
advance
in
the
price
ruggles
spread
out
his
hands
with
a
deprecatory
gesture
i
do
own
the
he
said
well
your
company
if
it
does
i
do
know
anything
about
oh
rot
as
if
you
and
genslinger
and
behrman
did
run
the
whole
show
down
here
come
on
let
have
it
ruggles
what
does
behrman
pay
genslinger
for
inserting
that
ad
of
the
and
in
his
paper
ten
thousand
a
year
hey
oh
why
not
a
hundred
thousand
and
be
done
with
it
returned
the
other
willing
to
take
it
as
a
joke
instead
of
replying
annixter
drew
his
from
his
inside
pocket
let
me
take
that
fountain
pen
of
yours
he
said
holding
the
book
on
his
knee
he
wrote
out
a
check
tore
it
carefully
from
the
stub
and
laid
it
on
the
desk
in
front
of
ruggles
what
this
asked
ruggles
payment
for
the
sections
of
railroad
land
included
in
my
ranch
based
on
a
valuation
of
two
dollars
and
a
half
per
acre
you
can
have
the
balance
in
ruggles
shook
his
head
drawing
hastily
back
from
the
check
as
though
it
carried
contamination
i
ca
touch
it
he
declared
i
no
authority
to
sell
to
you
i
do
understand
you
people
exclaimed
annixter
i
offered
to
buy
of
you
the
same
way
four
years
ago
and
you
sang
the
same
song
why
it
is
business
you
lose
the
interest
on
your
money
seven
per
cent
of
that
capital
for
four
years
you
can
figure
it
out
it
big
well
then
i
do
see
why
you
so
keen
on
parting
with
it
you
can
get
seven
per
cent
the
same
as
i
want
to
own
my
own
land
returned
annixter
i
want
to
feel
that
every
lump
of
dirt
inside
my
fence
is
my
personal
property
why
the
very
house
i
live
in
now
the
ranch
house
stands
on
railroad
but
you
an
option
i
tell
you
i
do
want
your
cursed
option
i
want
ownership
and
the
same
with
magnus
derrick
and
old
broderson
and
osterman
and
all
the
ranchers
of
the
county
we
want
to
own
our
land
want
to
feel
we
can
do
as
we
blame
please
with
it
suppose
i
should
want
to
sell
quien
sabe
i
ca
sell
it
as
a
whole
till
i
bought
of
you
i
ca
give
anybody
a
clear
title
the
land
has
doubled
in
value
ten
times
over
again
since
i
came
in
on
it
and
improved
it
it
worth
easily
twenty
an
acre
now
but
i
ca
take
advantage
of
that
rise
in
value
so
long
as
you
wo
sell
so
long
as
i
do
own
it
you
blocking
but
according
to
you
the
railroad
ca
take
advantage
of
the
rise
in
any
case
according
to
you
you
can
sell
for
twenty
dollars
but
we
can
only
get
two
and
a
who
made
it
worth
twenty
cried
annixter
i
improved
it
up
to
that
figure
genslinger
seems
to
have
that
idea
in
his
nut
too
do
you
people
think
you
can
hold
that
land
untaxed
for
speculative
purposes
until
it
goes
up
to
thirty
dollars
and
then
sell
out
to
some
one
else
sell
it
over
our
heads
you
and
genslinger
were
in
office
when
those
contracts
were
drawn
you
ask
your
boss
you
ask
behrman
he
knows
the
general
office
is
pledged
to
sell
to
us
in
preference
to
any
one
else
for
two
and
a
well
observed
ruggles
decidedly
tapping
the
end
of
his
pencil
on
his
desk
and
leaning
forward
to
emphasise
his
words
we
not
selling
now
that
said
and
signed
why
not
come
spit
it
out
what
the
bunco
game
this
time
because
we
not
ready
here
your
you
wo
take
it
i
make
it
a
cash
payment
money
down
the
whole
of
it
payable
to
cyrus
blakelee
ruggles
for
the
and
third
and
last
oh
go
to
the
devil
i
do
like
your
tone
annixter
returned
ruggles
flushing
angrily
i
do
give
a
curse
whether
you
like
it
or
not
retorted
annixter
rising
and
thrusting
the
check
into
his
pocket
but
never
you
mind
ruggles
you
and
behrman
and
genslinger
and
shelgrim
and
the
whole
gang
of
thieves
of
you

this
state
of
california
up
some
of
these
days
by
going
just
one
little
bit
too
far
and

and
smash

that
my
tip

you
and
be
damned
to
you
cyrus
blackleg
annixter
stormed
out
of
the
room
slamming
the
door
behind
him
and
ruggles
trembling
with
anger
turned
to
his
desk
and
to
the
blotting
pad
written
all
over
with
the
words
lands
twenty
dollars
two
and
a
half
option
and
over
and
over
again
with
great
swelling
curves
and
flourishes
railroad
railroad
railroad
but
as
annixter
passed
into
the
outside
office
on
the
other
side
of
the
wire
partition
he
noted
the
figure
of
a
man
at
the
counter
in
conversation
with
one
of
the
clerks
there
was
something
familiar
to
annixter
eye
about
the
man
heavy
built
frame
his
great
shoulders
and
massive
back
and
as
he
spoke
to
the
clerk
in
a
tremendous
rumbling
voice
annixter
promptly
recognised
dyke
there
was
a
meeting
annixter
liked
dyke
as
did
every
one
else
in
and
about
bonneville
he
paused
now
to
shake
hands
with
the
discharged
engineer
and
to
ask
about
his
little
daughter
sidney
to
whom
he
knew
dyke
was
devotedly
attached
smartest
little
tad
in
tulare
county
asserted
dyke
she
getting
prettier
every
day
annixter
there
a
little
tad
that
was
just
born
to
be
a
lady
can
recite
the
whole
of
bound
without
ever
stopping
you
do
believe
that
maybe
hey
well
it
true
she
be
just
old
enough
to
enter
the
seminary
up
at
marysville
next
winter
and
if
my
hop
business
pays
two
per
cent
on
the
investment
there
where
she
going
to
how
it
coming
on
inquired
annixter
the
hop
ranch
prime
i
about
got
the
land
in
shape
and
engaged
a
foreman
who
knows
all
about
hops
i
been
in
luck
everybody
will
go
into
the
business
next
year
when
they
see
hops
go
to
a
dollar
and
they
overstock
the
market
and
bust
the
price
but
i
going
to
get
the
cream
of
it
now
i
say
two
per
cent
why
lord
love
you
it
will
pay
a
good
deal
more
than
that
it
got
to
it
cost
more
than
i
figured
to
start
the
thing
so
perhaps
i
may
have
to
borrow
somewheres
but
then
on
such
a
sure
game
as
this
and
i
do
want
to
make
something
out
of
that
little
tad
of
through
here
inquired
annixter
making
ready
to
move
off
in
just
a
minute
answered
dyke
wait
for
me
and
i
walk
down
the
street
with
annixter
grumbled
that
he
was
in
a
hurry
but
waited
nevertheless
while
dyke
again
approached
the
clerk
i
shall
want
some
empty
cars
of
you
people
this
fall
he
explained
i
a
now
and
i
just
want
to
make
sure
what
your
rates
on
hops
are
i
been
told
but
i
want
to
make
sure
savvy
there
was
a
long
delay
while
the
clerk
consulted
the
tariff
schedules
and
annixter
fretted
impatiently
dyke
growing
uneasy
leaned
heavily
on
his
elbows
watching
the
clerk
anxiously
if
the
tariff
was
exorbitant
he
saw
his
plans
brought
to
naught
his
money
jeopardised
the
little
tad
sidney
deprived
of
her
education
he
began
to
blame
himself
that
he
had
not
long
before
determined
definitely
what
the
railroad
would
charge
for
moving
his
hops
he
told
himself
he
was
not
much
of
a
business
man
that
he
managed
carelessly
two
cents
suddenly
announced
the
clerk
with
a
certain
surly
indifference
two
cents
a
pound
yes
two
cents
a
pound
that
in
lots
of
course
i
give
you
that
rate
on
smaller
yes
lots
of
course
two
cents
well
all
he
turned
away
with
a
great
sigh
of
relief
he
sure
did
have
me
scared
for
a
minute
he
said
to
annixter
as
the
two
went
down
to
the
street
fiddling
and
fussing
so
long
two
cents
is
all
right
though
seems
fair
to
me
that
fiddling
of
his
was
all
put
on
i
know
these
railroad
heelers
he
knew
i
was
a
discharged
employee
first
off
and
he
played
the
game
just
to
make
me
seem
small
because
i
had
to
ask
favours
of
him
i
do
suppose
the
general
office
tips
its
slavees
off
to
act
like
swine
but
there
the
feeling
through
the
whole
herd
of
them
got
to
come
to
us
we
let
ye
live
only
so
long
as
we
choose
and
what
are
ye
going
to
do
about
it
if
ye
like
it
git
out
annixter
and
the
engineer
descended
to
the
street
and
had
a
drink
at
the
yosemite
bar
and
annixter
went
into
the
general
store
while
dyke
bought
a
little
pair
of
red
slippers
for
sidney
before
the
salesman
had
wrapped
them
up
dyke
slipped
a
dime
into
the
toe
of
each
with
a
wink
at
annixter
let
the
little
tad
find
there
he
said
behind
his
hand
in
a
hoarse
whisper
that
be
one
on
where
to
now
demanded
annixter
as
they
regained
the
street
going
down
to
the
post
office
and
then
pull
out
for
the
ranch
going
my
way
dyke
hesitated
in
some
confusion
tugging
at
the
ends
of
his
fine
blonde
beard
no
no
i
guess
i
leave
you
here
i
got
got
other
things
to
do
up
the
street
so
the
two
separated
and
annixter
hurried
through
the
crowd
to
the
post
office
but
the
mail
that
had
come
in
on
that
morning
train
was
unusually
heavy
it
was
nearly
half
an
hour
before
it
was
distributed
naturally
enough
annixter
placed
all
the
blame
of
the
delay
upon
the
railroad
and
delivered
himself
of
some
pointed
remarks
in
the
midst
of
the
waiting
crowd
he
was
irritated
to
the
last
degree
when
he
finally
emerged
upon
the
sidewalk
again
cramming
his
mail
into
his
pockets
one
cause
of
his
bad
temper
was
the
fact
that
in
the
bundle
of
quien
sabe
letters
was
one
to
hilma
tree
in
a
man
handwriting
huh
annixter
had
growled
to
himself
that
pip
delaney
seems
now
that
i
to
act
as
for
well
maybe
that
feemale
girl
gets
this
letter
and
then
again
maybe
she
but
suddenly
his
attention
was
diverted
directly
opposite
the
post
office
upon
the
corner
of
the
street
stood
quite
the
best
business
building
of
which
bonneville
could
boast
it
was
built
of
colusa
granite
very
solid
ornate
imposing
upon
the
heavy
plate
of
the
window
of
its
main
floor
in
gold
and
red
letters
one
read
the
words
loan
and
savings
bank
of
tulare
it
was
of
this
bank
that
behrman
was
president
at
the
street
entrance
of
the
building
was
a
curved
sign
of
polished
brass
fixed
upon
the
angle
of
the
masonry
this
sign
bore
the
name
s
behrman
and
under
it
in
smaller
letters
were
the
words
real
estate
as
annixter
glance
fell
upon
this
building
he
was
surprised
to
see
dyke
standing
upon
the
curb
in
front
of
it
apparently
reading
from
a
newspaper
that
he
held
in
his
hand
but
annixter
promptly
discovered
that
he
was
not
reading
at
all
from
time
to
time
the
former
engineer
shot
a
swift
glance
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
up
and
down
the
street
annixter
jumped
at
a
conclusion
an
idea
suddenly
occurred
to
him
dyke
was
watching
to
see
if
he
was
observed
was
waiting
an
opportunity
when
no
one
who
knew
him
should
be
in
sight
annixter
stepped
back
a
little
getting
a
telegraph
pole
somewhat
between
him
and
the
other
very
interested
he
watched
what
was
going
on
pretty
soon
dyke
thrust
the
paper
into
his
pocket
and
sauntered
slowly
to
the
windows
of
a
stationery
store
next
the
street
entrance
of
behrman
offices
for
a
few
seconds
he
stood
there
his
back
turned
seemingly
absorbed
in
the
display
but
eyeing
the
street
narrowly
nevertheless
then
he
turned
around
gave
a
last
look
about
and
stepped
swiftly
into
the
doorway
by
the
great
brass
sign
he
disappeared
annixter
came
from
behind
the
telegraph
pole
with
a
flush
of
actual
shame
upon
his
face
there
had
been
something
so
slinking
so
mean
in
the
movements
and
manner
of
this
great
burly
honest
fellow
of
an
engineer
that
he
could
not
help
but
feel
ashamed
for
him
circumstances
were
such
that
a
simple
business
transaction
was
to
dyke
almost
culpable
a
degradation
a
thing
to
be
concealed
borrowing
money
of
behrman
commented
annixter
mortgaging
your
little
homestead
to
the
railroad
putting
your
neck
in
the
halter
poor
fool
the
pity
of
it
good
lord
your
hops
must
pay
you
big
now
old
annixter
lunched
at
the
yosemite
hotel
and
then
later
on
toward
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
rode
out
of
the
town
at
a
canter
by
the
way
of
the
upper
road
that
paralleled
the
railroad
tracks
and
that
ran
diametrically
straight
between
bonneville
and
guadalajara
about
between
the
two
places
he
overtook
father
sarria
trudging
back
to
san
juan
his
long
cassock
powdered
with
dust
he
had
a
wicker
crate
in
one
hand
and
in
the
other
in
a
small
square
valise
the
materials
for
the
holy
sacrament
since
early
morning
the
priest
had
covered
nearly
fifteen
miles
on
foot
in
order
to
administer
extreme
unction
to
a
moribund
a
greaser
half
indian
half
portuguese
who
lived
in
a
remote
corner
of
osterman
stock
range
at
the
head
of
a
canon
there
but
he
had
returned
by
way
of
bonneville
to
get
a
crate
that
had
come
for
him
from
san
diego
he
had
been
notified
of
its
arrival
the
day
before
annixter
pulled
up
and
passed
the
time
of
day
with
the
priest
i
do
often
get
up
your
way
he
said
slowing
down
his
horse
to
accommodate
sarria
deliberate
plodding
sarria
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
smooth
shiny
face
you
well
with
you
it
is
different
he
answered
but
there
are
a
great
many
catholics
in
the
county
some
on
your
ranch
and
so
few
come
to
the
mission
at
high
mass
on
sundays
there
are
a
few
mexicans
and
spaniards
from
guadalajara
mostly
but
weekdays
for
matins
vespers
and
the
like
i
often
say
the
offices
to
an
empty
church
voice
of
one
crying
in
the
wilderness
you
americans
are
not
good
churchmen
sundays
you
sleep
you
read
the
well
there
vanamee
observed
annixter
i
suppose
he
there
early
and
sarria
made
a
sharp
movement
of
interest
ah
vanamee
a
strange
lad
a
wonderful
character
for
all
that
if
there
were
only
more
like
him
i
am
troubled
about
him
you
know
i
am
a
very
owl
at
night
i
come
and
go
about
the
mission
at
all
hours
within
the
week
three
times
i
have
seen
vanamee
in
the
little
garden
by
the
mission
and
at
the
dead
of
night
he
had
come
without
asking
for
me
he
did
not
see
me
it
was
strange
once
when
i
had
got
up
at
dawn
to
ring
for
early
matins
i
saw
him
stealing
away
out
of
the
garden
he
must
have
been
there
all
the
night
he
is
acting
queerly
he
is
pale
his
cheeks
are
more
sunken
than
ever
there
is
something
wrong
with
him
i
ca
make
it
out
it
is
a
mystery
suppose
you
ask
him
not
i
enough
to
bother
myself
about
vanamee
is
crazy
in
the
head
some
morning
he
will
turn
up
missing
again
and
drop
out
of
sight
for
another
three
years
best
let
him
alone
sarria
he
a
crank
how
is
that
greaser
of
yours
up
on
osterman
stock
range
ah
the
poor
fellow
the
poor
fellow
returned
the
other
the
tears
coming
to
his
eyes
he
died
this
morning
as
you
might
say
in
my
arms
painfully
but
in
the
faith
in
the
faith
a
good
a
lazy
you
misjudge
him
a
really
good
fellow
on
better
annixter
grunted
scornfully
sarria
kindness
and
toward
the
most
outrageous
reprobates
of
the
ranches
was
proverbial
he
practically
supported
some
families
that
lived
in
forgotten
cabins
lost
and
all
but
inaccessible
in
the
far
corners
of
stock
range
and
canyon
this
particular
greaser
was
the
laziest
the
dirtiest
the
most
worthless
of
the
lot
but
in
sarria
mind
the
lout
was
an
object
of
affection
sincere
unquestioning
thrice
a
week
the
priest
with
a
basket
of
provisions
cold
ham
a
bottle
of
wine
olives
loaves
of
bread
even
a
chicken
or
two
toiled
over
the
interminable
stretch
of
country
between
the
mission
and
his
cabin
of
late
during
the
sickness
these
visits
had
been
almost
daily
hardly
once
did
the
priest
leave
the
bedside
that
he
did
not
slip
a
into
the
palm
of
his
wife
or
oldest
daughter
and
this
was
but
one
case
out
of
many
his
kindliness
toward
animals
was
the
same
a
horde
of
curs
lived
off
his
bounty
wolfish
ungrateful
often
marking
him
with
their
teeth
yet
never
knowing
the
meaning
of
a
harsh
word
a
burro
lazy
incorrigible
browsed
on
the
hill
back
of
the
mission
obstinately
refusing
to
be
harnessed
to
sarria
little
cart
squealing
and
biting
whenever
the
attempt
was
made
and
the
priest
suffered
him
submitting
to
his
humour
inventing
excuses
for
him
alleging
that
the
burro
was
foundered
or
was
in
need
of
shoes
or
was
feeble
from
extreme
age
the
two
peacocks
magnificent
proud
resenting
all
familiarity
he
served
with
the
timorous
apologetic
affection
of
a
queen
resigned
to
their
disdain
happy
if
only
they
condescended
to
enjoy
the
grain
he
spread
for
them
at
the
long
trestle
annixter
and
the
priest
left
the
road
and
took
the
trail
that
crossed
broderson
creek
by
the
clumps
of
willows
and
led
across
quien
sabe
to
the
ranch
house
and
to
the
mission
farther
on
they
were
obliged
to
proceed
in
single
file
here
and
annixter
who
had
allowed
the
priest
to
go
in
front
promptly
took
notice
of
the
wicker
basket
he
carried
upon
his
inquiry
sarria
became
confused
it
was
a
basket
that
he
had
had
sent
down
to
him
from
the
well
i
know
but
what
in
it
why
i
sure
ah
poultry
a
chicken
or
fancy
breed
yes
yes
that
it
a
fancy
at
the
ranch
house
where
they
arrived
toward
five
annixter
insisted
that
the
priest
should
stop
long
enough
for
a
glass
of
sherry
sarria
left
the
basket
and
his
small
black
valise
at
the
foot
of
the
porch
steps
and
sat
down
in
a
rocker
on
the
porch
itself
fanning
himself
with
his
hat
and
shaking
the
dust
from
his
cassock
annixter
brought
out
the
decanter
of
sherry
and
glasses
and
the
two
drank
to
each
other
health
but
as
the
priest
set
down
his
glass
wiping
his
lips
with
a
murmur
of
satisfaction
the
decrepit
irish
setter
that
had
attached
himself
to
annixter
house
came
out
from
underneath
the
porch
and
nosed
vigorously
about
the
wicker
basket
he
upset
it
the
little
peg
holding
down
the
cover
slipped
the
basket
fell
sideways
opening
as
it
fell
and
a
cock
his
head
enclosed
in
a
little
chamois
bag
such
as
are
used
for
gold
watches
struggled
blindly
out
into
the
open
air
a
second
similarly
hooded
followed
the
pair
stupefied
in
their
headgear
stood
rigid
and
bewildered
in
their
tracks
clucking
uneasily
their
tails
were
closely
sheared
their
legs
thickly
muscled
and
extraordinarily
long
were
furnished
with
enormous
spurs
the
breed
was
unmistakable
annixter
looked
once
at
the
pair
then
shouted
with
laughter
chicken
or
two
breed
ho
yes
i
should
think
so
game
cocks
fighting
cocks
oh
you
old
rat
you
be
a
dry
nurse
to
a
burro
and
keep
a
hospital
for
infirm
puppies
but
you
will
fight
game
cocks
oh
lord
why
sarria
this
is
as
good
a
grind
as
i
ever
heard
there
the
spanish
cropping
out
after
speechless
with
chagrin
the
priest
bundled
the
cocks
into
the
basket
and
catching
up
the
valise
took
himself
abruptly
away
almost
running
till
he
had
put
himself
out
of
hearing
of
annixter
raillery
and
even
ten
minutes
later
when
annixter
still
chuckling
stood
upon
the
porch
steps
he
saw
the
priest
far
in
the
distance
climbing
the
slope
of
the
high
ground
in
the
direction
of
the
mission
still
hurrying
on
at
a
great
pace
his
cassock
flapping
behind
him
his
head
bent
to
annixter
notion
the
very
picture
of
discomfiture
and
confusion
as
annixter
turned
about
to
reenter
the
house
he
found
himself
almost
face
to
face
with
hilma
tree
she
was
just
going
in
at
the
doorway
and
a
great
flame
of
the
sunset
shooting
in
under
the
eaves
of
the
porch
enveloped
her
from
her
head
with
its
thick
moist
hair
that
hung
low
over
her
neck
to
her
slim
feet
setting
a
golden
flash
in
the
little
steel
buckles
of
her
low
shoes
she
had
come
to
set
the
table
for
annixter
supper
taken
all
aback
by
the
suddenness
of
the
encounter
annixter
ejaculated
an
abrupt
and
senseless
excuse
but
hilma
without
raising
her
eyes
passed
on
unmoved
into
the
leaving
annixter
trying
to
find
his
breath
and
fumbling
with
the
brim
of
his
hat
that
he
was
surprised
to
find
he
had
taken
from
his
head
resolutely
and
taking
a
quick
advantage
of
his
opportunity
he
followed
her
into
the
i
see
that
dog
has
turned
up
he
announced
with
brisk
cheerfulness
that
irish
setter
i
was
asking
hilma
a
swift
pink
flush
deepening
the
delicate
rose
of
her
cheeks
did
not
reply
except
by
nodding
her
head
she
flung
the
out
from
under
her
arms
across
the
table
spreading
it
smooth
with
quick
little
caresses
of
her
hands
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
annixter
said
here
a
letter
for
he
laid
it
down
on
the
table
near
her
and
hilma
picked
it
up
and
see
here
miss
hilma
annixter
continued
about
that
this
morning
i

mucker

any
good
to
apologise

friends
with
me
hilma
set
the
plate
and
coffee
cup
by
annixter
place
before
answering
and
annixter
repeated
his
question
then
she
drew
a
deep
quick
breath
the
flush
in
her
cheeks
returning
i
think
it
was
it
was
so
wrong
of
you
she
murmured
oh
you
know
how
it
hurt
me
i
cried
oh

an
well
that
just
it
returned
annixter
vaguely
moving
his
head
uneasily
i
did
know
what
kind
of
a
girl
you
were
i
mean
i
made
a
mistake
i
thought
it
did
make
much
difference
i
thought

feemales

about
i
hope
you
know
now
murmured
hilma
ruefully
i
paid
enough
to
have
you
find
out
i
cried
you
do
know
why
it
hurt
me
worse
than
anything
i
can
remember
i
hope
you
know
well
i
do
know
now
he
exclaimed
it
was
so
much
that
you
tried
to
do
what
you
did
answered
hilma
the
single
deep
swell
from
her
waist
to
her
throat
rising
and
falling
in
her
emotion
it
was
that
you
thought
that
you
could
that
anybody
could
that
wanted
to
that
i
held
myself
so
cheap
oh
she
cried
with
a
sudden
sobbing
catch
in
her
throat
i
never
can
forget
it
and
you
do
know
what
it
means
to
a
well
that
just
what
i
do
want
he
repeated
i
want
you
to
forget
it
and
have
us
be
good
in
his
embarrassment
annixter
could
think
of
no
other
words
he
kept
reiterating
again
and
again
during
the
pauses
of
the
conversation
i
want
you
to
forget
it
will
you
will
you
forget
it
that
this
morning
and
have
us
be
good
friends
he
could
see
that
her
trouble
was
keen
he
was
astonished
that
the
matter
should
be
so
grave
in
her
estimation
after
all
what
was
it
that
a
girl
should
be
kissed
but
he
wanted
to
regain
his
lost
ground
will
you
forget
it
miss
hilma
i
want
you
to
like
she
took
a
clean
napkin
from
the
sideboard
drawer
and
laid
it
down
by
the
plate
i
i
do
want
you
to
like
me
persisted
annixter
i
want
you
to
forget
all
about
this
business
and
like
hilma
was
silent
annixter
saw
the
tears
in
her
eyes
how
about
that
will
you
forget
it
will
you
will
will
you
like
me
she
shook
her
head
no
she
said
no
what
you
wo
like
me
is
that
it
hilma
blinking
at
the
napkin
through
her
tears
nodded
to
say
yes
that
was
it
annixter
hesitated
a
moment
frowning
harassed
and
perplexed
you
do
like
me
at
all
hey
at
length
hilma
found
her
speech
in
her
low
voice
lower
and
more
velvety
than
ever
she
said
no
i
do
like
you
at
then
as
the
tears
suddenly
overpowered
her
she
dashed
a
hand
across
her
eyes
and
ran
from
the
room
and
out
of
doors
annixter
stood
for
a
moment
thoughtful
his
protruding
lower
lip
thrust
out
his
hands
in
his
pocket
i
suppose
she
quit
now
he
muttered
suppose
she
leave
the
ranch
if
she
hates
me
like
that
well
she
can
go
that
all
she
can
go
fool
feemale
girl
he
muttered
between
his
teeth
petticoat
he
was
about
to
sit
down
to
his
supper
when
his
eye
fell
upon
the
irish
setter
on
his
haunches
in
the
doorway
there
was
an
expectant
ingratiating
look
on
the
dog
face
no
doubt
he
suspected
it
was
time
for
eating
get
out
you
roared
annixter
in
a
tempest
of
wrath
the
dog
slunk
back
his
tail
shut
down
close
his
ears
drooping
but
instead
of
running
away
he
lay
down
and
rolled
supinely
upon
his
back
the
very
image
of
submission
tame
abject
disgusting
it
was
the
one
thing
to
drive
annixter
to
a
fury
he
kicked
the
dog
off
the
porch
in
a
rolling
explosion
of
oaths
and
flung
himself
down
to
his
seat
before
the
table
fuming
and
panting
damn
the
dog
and
the
girl
and
the
whole
rotten
business
and
now
he
exclaimed
as
a
sudden
fancied
qualm
arose
in
his
stomach
now
all
made
me
sick
might
have
known
it
oh
it
only
lacked
that
to
wind
up
the
whole
day
let
her
go
i
do
care
and
the
sooner
the
he
countermanded
the
supper
and
went
to
bed
before
it
was
dark
lighting
his
lamp
on
the
chair
near
the
head
of
the
bed
and
opening
his
copperfield
at
the
place
marked
by
the
strip
of
paper
torn
from
the
bag
of
prunes
for
upward
of
an
hour
he
read
the
novel
methodically
swallowing
one
prune
every
time
he
reached
the
bottom
of
a
page
about
nine
he
blew
out
the
lamp
and
punching
up
his
pillow
settled
himself
for
the
night
then
as
his
mind
relaxed
in
that
strange
hypnotic
condition
that
comes
just
before
sleep
a
series
of
pictures
of
the
day
doings
passed
before
his
imagination
like
the
roll
of
a
kinetoscope
first
it
was
hilma
tree
as
he
had
seen
her
in
the
charming
delicious
radiant
of
youth
her
thick
white
neck
with
its
pale
amber
shadows
under
the
chin
her
wide
open
eyes
rimmed
with
fine
black
lashes
the
deep
swell
of
her
breast
and
hips
the
delicate
lustrous
floss
on
her
cheek
impalpable
as
the
pollen
of
a
flower
he
saw
her
standing
there
in
the
scintillating
light
of
the
morning
her
smooth
arms
wet
with
milk
redolent
and
fragrant
of
milk
her
whole
desirable
figure
moving
in
the
golden
glory
of
the
sun
steeped
in
a
lambent
flame
saturated
with
it
glowing
with
it
joyous
as
the
dawn
itself
then
it
was
los
muertos
and
hooven
the
sordid
little
dutchman
grimed
with
the
soil
he
worked
in
yet
vividly
remembering
a
period
of
military
glory
exciting
himself
with
recollections
of
gravelotte
and
the
kaiser
but
contented
now
in
the
country
of
his
adoption
defining
the
fatherland
as
the
place
where
wife
and
children
lived
then
came
the
ranch
house
of
los
muertos
under
the
grove
of
cypress
and
eucalyptus
with
its
smooth
gravelled
driveway
and
lawns
derrick
with
her
eyes
that
so
easily
took
on
a
look
of
uneasiness
of
innocence
of
anxious
inquiry
her
face
still
pretty
her
brown
hair
that
still
retained
so
much
of
its
brightness
spread
over
her
chair
back
drying
in
the
sun
magnus
erect
as
an
officer
of
cavalry
grey
imposing
with
his
nose
and
grey
hair
presley
with
his
dark
face
delicate
mouth
and
sensitive
loose
lips
in
corduroys
and
laced
boots
smoking
cigarettes
an
interesting
figure
suggestive
of
a
mixed
origin
morbid
excitable
melancholy
brooding
upon
things
that
had
no
names
then
it
was
bonneville
with
the
gayety
and
confusion
of
main
street
the
whirring
electric
cars
the
telegraph
poles
the
buckboards
with
squashes
stowed
under
the
seats
ruggles
in
frock
coat
stetson
hat
and
necktie
writing
abstractedly
upon
his
blotting
pad
dyke
the
engineer
powerful
with
his
fine
blonde
beard
and
massive
arms
rehearsing
the
praises
of
his
little
daughter
sidney
guided
only
by
the
one
ambition
that
she
should
be
educated
at
a
seminary
slipping
a
dime
into
the
toe
of
her
diminutive
slipper
then
later
overwhelmed
with
shame
slinking
into
behrman
office
to
mortgage
his
homestead
to
the
heeler
of
the
corporation
that
had
discharged
him
by
suggestion
annixter
saw
behrman
too
fat
with
a
vast
stomach
the
check
and
neck
meeting
to
form
a
great
tremulous
jowl
the
roll
of
fat
over
his
collar
sprinkled
with
sparse
stiff
hairs
saw
his
brown
hat
of
varnished
straw
the
linen
vest
stamped
with
innumerable
interlocked
horseshoes
the
heavy
watch
chain
clinking
against
the
pearl
vest
buttons
invariably
placid
unruffled
never
losing
his
temper
serene
unassailable
enthroned
then
at
the
end
of
all
it
was
the
ranch
again
seen
in
a
last
brief
glance
before
he
had
gone
to
bed
the
fecundated
earth
calm
at
last
nursing
the
emplanted
germ
of
life
ruddy
with
the
sunset
the
horizons
purple
the
small
clamour
of
the
day
lapsing
into
quiet
the
great
still
twilight
building
itself
toward
the
zenith
the
barn
fowls
were
roosting
in
the
trees
near
the
stable
the
horses
crunching
their
fodder
in
the
stalls
the
day
work
ceasing
by
slow
degrees
and
the
priest
the
spanish
churchman
father
sarria
relic
of
a
departed
regime
kindly
benign
believing
in
all
goodness
a
lover
of
his
fellows
and
of
dumb
animals
yet
for
all
that
hurrying
away
in
confusion
and
discomfiture
carrying
in
one
hand
the
vessels
of
the
holy
communion
and
in
the
other
a
basket
of
game
cocks
chapter
vi
it
was
high
noon
and
the
rays
of
the
sun
that
hung
poised
directly
overhead
in
an
intolerable
white
glory
fell
straight
as
plummets
upon
the
roofs
and
streets
of
guadalajara
the
adobe
walls
and
sparse
brick
sidewalks
of
the
drowsing
town
radiated
the
heat
in
an
oily
quivering
shimmer
the
leaves
of
the
eucalyptus
trees
around
the
plaza
drooped
motionless
limp
and
relaxed
under
the
scorching
searching
blaze
the
shadows
of
these
trees
had
shrunk
to
their
smallest
circumference
contracting
close
about
the
trunks
the
shade
had
dwindled
to
the
breadth
of
a
mere
line
the
sun
was
everywhere
the
heat
exhaling
from
brick
and
plaster
and
metal
met
the
heat
that
steadily
descended
blanketwise
and
smothering
from
the
pale
scorched
sky
only
the
lizards
they
lived
in
chinks
of
the
crumbling
adobe
and
in
interstices
of
the
sidewalk
remained
without
motionless
as
if
stuffed
their
eyes
closed
to
mere
slits
basking
stupefied
with
heat
at
long
intervals
the
prolonged
drone
of
an
insect
developed
out
of
the
silence
vibrated
a
moment
in
a
soothing
somnolent
long
note
then
trailed
slowly
into
the
quiet
again
somewhere
in
the
interior
of
one
of
the
houses
a
guitar
snored
and
hummed
sleepily
on
the
roof
of
the
hotel
a
group
of
pigeons
cooed
incessantly
with
subdued
liquid
murmurs
very
plaintive
a
cat
perfectly
white
with
a
pink
nose
and
thin
pink
lips
dozed
complacently
on
a
fence
rail
full
in
the
sun
in
a
corner
of
the
plaza
three
hens
wallowed
in
the
baking
hot
dust
their
wings
fluttering
clucking
comfortably
and
this
was
all
a
sunday
repose
prevailed
the
whole
moribund
town
peaceful
profound
a
certain
pleasing
numbness
a
sense
of
grateful
enervation
exhaled
from
the
scorching
plaster
there
was
no
movement
no
sound
of
human
business
the
faint
hum
of
the
insect
the
intermittent
murmur
of
the
guitar
the
mellow
complainings
of
the
pigeons
the
prolonged
purr
of
the
white
cat
the
contented
clucking
of
the
hens
all
these
noises
mingled
together
to
form
a
faint
drowsy
bourdon
prolonged
stupefying
suggestive
of
an
infinite
quiet
of
a
calm
complacent
life
centuries
old
lapsing
gradually
to
its
end
under
the
gorgeous
loneliness
of
a
cloudless
pale
blue
sky
and
the
steady
fire
of
an
interminable
sun
in
solotari
restaurant
vanamee
and
presley
sat
opposite
each
other
at
one
of
the
tables
near
the
door
a
bottle
of
white
wine
tortillas
and
an
earthen
pot
of
frijoles
between
them
they
were
the
sole
occupants
of
the
place
it
was
the
day
that
annixter
had
chosen
for
his
and
in
consequence
quien
sabe
was
in
fete
and
work
suspended
presley
and
vanamee
had
arranged
to
spend
the
day
in
each
other
company
lunching
at
solotari
and
taking
a
long
tramp
in
the
afternoon
for
the
moment
they
sat
back
in
their
chairs
their
meal
all
but
finished
solotari
brought
black
coffee
and
a
small
carafe
of
mescal
and
retiring
to
a
corner
of
the
room
went
to
sleep
all
through
the
meal
presley
had
been
wondering
over
a
certain
change
he
observed
in
his
friend
he
looked
at
him
again
vanamee
lean
spare
face
was
of
an
olive
pallor
his
long
black
hair
such
as
one
sees
in
the
saints
and
evangelists
of
the
artists
hung
over
his
ears
presley
again
remarked
his
pointed
beard
black
and
fine
growing
from
the
hollow
cheeks
he
looked
at
his
face
a
face
like
that
of
a
young
seer
like
a
shepherd
of
the
hebraic
legends
a
dweller
in
the
wilderness
gifted
with
strange
powers
he
was
dressed
as
when
presley
had
first
met
him
herding
his
sheep
in
brown
canvas
overalls
thrust
into
top
boots
grey
flannel
shirt
open
at
the
throat
showing
the
breast
ruddy
with
tan
the
waist
encircled
with
a
cartridge
belt
empty
of
cartridges
but
now
as
presley
took
more
careful
note
of
him
he
was
surprised
to
observe
a
certain
new
look
in
vanamee
eyes
he
remembered
now
that
all
through
the
morning
vanamee
had
been
singularly
reserved
he
was
continually
drifting
into
reveries
abstracted
distrait
indubitably
something
of
moment
had
happened
at
length
vanamee
spoke
leaning
back
in
his
chair
his
thumbs
in
his
belt
his
bearded
chin
upon
his
breast
his
voice
was
the
even
monotone
of
one
speaking
in
his
sleep
he
told
presley
in
a
few
words
what
had
happened
during
the
first
night
he
had
spent
in
the
garden
of
the
old
mission
of
the
answer
that
had
come
to
him
to
no
other
person
but
you
would
i
speak
of
this
he
said
but
you
i
think
will
understand
will
be
sympathetic
at
least
and
i
feel
the
need
of
unburdening
myself
of
it
to
some
one
at
first
i
would
not
trust
my
own
senses
i
was
sure
i
had
deceived
myself
but
on
a
second
night
it
happened
again
then
i
was
afraid
or
no
not
afraid
but
disturbed
oh
shaken
to
my
very
heart
core
i
resolved
to
go
no
further
in
the
matter
never
again
to
put
it
to
test
for
a
long
time
i
stayed
away
from
the
mission
occupying
myself
with
my
work
keeping
it
out
of
my
mind
but
the
temptation
was
too
strong
one
night
i
found
myself
there
again
under
the
black
shadow
of
the
pear
trees
calling
for
angele
summoning
her
from
out
the
dark
from
out
the
night
this
time
the
answer
was
prompt
unmistakable
i
can
not
explain
to
you
what
it
was
nor
how
it
came
to
me
for
there
was
no
sound
i
saw
absolutely
nothing
but
the
empty
night
there
was
no
moon
but
somewhere
off
there
over
the
little
valley
far
off
the
darkness
was
troubled
that
me
that
went
out
upon
my
thought
out
from
the
mission
garden
out
over
the
valley
calling
for
her
searching
for
her
found
i
do
know
what
but
found
a
resting
place
a
companion
three
times
since
then
i
have
gone
to
the
mission
garden
at
night
last
night
was
the
third
he
paused
his
eyes
shining
with
excitement
presley
leaned
forward
toward
him
motionless
with
intense
absorption
well
and
last
night
he
prompted
vanamee
stirred
in
his
seat
his
glance
fell
he
drummed
an
instant
upon
the
table
last
night
he
answered
there
was
there
was
a
change
the
answer
was
he
drew
a
deep
breath
you
are
sure
the
other
smiled
with
absolute
certainty
it
was
not
that
i
found
the
answer
sooner
easier
i
could
not
be
mistaken
no
that
which
has
troubled
the
darkness
that
which
has
entered
into
the
empty
night
is
coming
nearer
to
me
physically
nearer
actually
his
voice
sank
again
his
face
like
the
face
of
younger
prophets
the
seers
took
on
a
expression
he
looked
vaguely
before
him
with
unseeing
eyes
suppose
he
murmured
suppose
i
stand
there
under
the
pear
trees
at
night
and
call
her
again
and
again
and
each
time
the
answer
comes
nearer
and
nearer
and
i
wait
until
at
last
one
night
the
supreme
night
of
all
she
she
suddenly
the
tension
broke
with
a
sharp
cry
and
a
violent
uncertain
gesture
of
the
hand
vanamee
came
to
himself
oh
he
exclaimed
what
is
it
do
i
dare
what
does
it
mean
there
are
times
when
it
appals
me
and
there
are
times
when
it
thrills
me
with
a
sweetness
and
a
happiness
that
i
have
not
known
since
she
died
the
vagueness
of
it
how
can
i
explain
it
to
you
this
that
happens
when
i
call
to
her
across
the
night
that
faint
unseen
tremble
in
the
darkness
that
intangible
scarcely
perceptible
stir
something
neither
heard
nor
seen
appealing
to
a
sixth
sense
only
listen
it
is
something
like
this
on
quien
sabe
all
last
week
we
have
been
seeding
the
earth
the
grain
is
there
now
under
the
earth
buried
in
the
dark
in
the
black
stillness
under
the
clods
can
you
imagine
the
first
the
very
first
little
quiver
of
life
that
the
grain
of
wheat
must
feel
after
it
is
sown
when
it
answers
to
the
call
of
the
sun
down
there
in
the
dark
of
the
earth
blind
deaf
the
very
first
stir
from
the
inert
long
long
before
any
physical
change
has
occurred
long
before
the
microscope
could
discover
the
slightest
change
when
the
shell
first
tightens
with
the
first
faint
premonition
of
life
well
it
is
something
as
illusive
as
he
paused
again
dreaming
lost
in
a
reverie
then
just
above
a
whisper
murmured
which
thou
sowest
is
not
quickened
except
it
die
and
she
angele
you
could
not
have
been
mistaken
said
presley
you
were
sure
that
there
was
something
imagination
can
do
so
much
and
the
influence
of
the
surroundings
was
strong
how
impossible
it
would
be
that
anything
should
happen
and
you
say
you
heard
nothing
saw
i
believe
answered
vanamee
in
a
sixth
sense
or
rather
a
whole
system
of
other
unnamed
senses
beyond
the
reach
of
our
understanding
people
who
live
much
alone
and
close
to
nature
experience
the
sensation
of
it
perhaps
it
is
something
fundamental
that
we
share
with
plants
and
animals
the
same
thing
that
sends
the
birds
south
long
before
the
first
colds
the
same
thing
that
makes
the
grain
of
wheat
struggle
up
to
meet
the
sun
and
this
sense
never
deceives
you
may
see
wrong
hear
wrong
but
once
touch
this
sixth
sense
and
it
acts
with
absolute
fidelity
you
are
certain
no
i
hear
nothing
in
the
mission
garden
i
see
nothing
nothing
touches
me
but
i
am
certain
for
all
presley
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
he
asked
shall
you
go
back
to
the
garden
again
make
the
test
again
i
strange
enough
commented
presley
wondering
vanamee
sank
back
in
his
chair
his
eyes
growing
vacant
again
strange
enough
he
murmured
there
was
a
long
silence
neither
spoke
nor
moved
there
in
that
moribund
ancient
town
wrapped
in
its
siesta
flagellated
with
heat
deserted
ignored
baking
in
a
silence
these
two
strange
men
the
one
a
poet
by
nature
the
other
by
training
both
out
of
tune
with
their
world
dreamers
introspective
morbid
lost
and
unfamiliar
at
that
time
searching
for
a
sign
groping
and
baffled
amidst
the
perplexing
obscurity
of
the
delusion
sat
over
empty
wine
glasses
silent
with
the
pervading
silence
that
surrounded
them
hearing
only
the
cooing
of
doves
and
the
drone
of
bees
the
quiet
so
profound
that
at
length
they
could
plainly
distinguish
at
intervals
the
puffing
and
coughing
of
a
locomotive
switching
cars
in
the
station
yard
of
bonneville
it
was
no
doubt
this
jarring
sound
that
at
length
roused
presley
from
his
lethargy
the
two
friends
rose
solotari
very
sleepily
came
forward
they
paid
for
the
luncheon
and
stepping
out
into
the
heat
and
glare
of
the
streets
of
the
town
passed
on
through
it
and
took
the
road
that
led
northward
across
a
corner
of
dyke
hop
fields
they
were
bound
for
the
hills
in
the
northeastern
corner
of
quien
sabe
it
was
the
same
walk
which
presley
had
taken
on
the
previous
occasion
when
he
had
first
met
vanamee
herding
the
sheep
this
encompassing
detour
around
the
whole
was
a
favorite
pastime
of
his
and
he
was
anxious
that
vanamee
should
share
his
pleasure
in
it
but
soon
after
leaving
guadalajara
they
found
themselves
upon
the
land
that
dyke
had
bought
and
upon
which
he
was
to
raise
his
famous
crop
of
hops
dyke
house
was
close
at
hand
a
very
pleasant
little
cottage
painted
white
with
green
blinds
and
deep
porches
while
near
it
and
yet
in
process
of
construction
were
two
great
storehouses
and
a
drying
and
curing
house
where
the
hops
were
to
be
stored
and
treated
all
about
were
evidences
that
the
former
engineer
had
already
been
hard
at
work
the
ground
had
been
put
in
readiness
to
receive
the
crop
and
a
bewildering
innumerable
multitude
of
poles
connected
with
a
maze
of
wire
and
twine
had
been
set
out
farther
on
at
a
turn
of
the
road
they
came
upon
dyke
himself
driving
a
farm
wagon
loaded
with
more
poles
he
was
in
his
shirt
sleeves
his
massive
hairy
arms
bare
to
the
elbow
glistening
with
sweat
red
with
heat
in
his
rumbling
voice
he
was
calling
to
his
foreman
and
a
boy
at
work
in
stringing
the
poles
together
at
sight
of
presley
and
vanamee
he
hailed
them
jovially
addressing
them
as
boys
and
insisting
that
they
should
get
into
the
wagon
with
him
and
drive
to
the
house
for
a
glass
of
beer
his
mother
had
only
the
day
before
returned
from
marysville
where
she
had
been
looking
up
a
seminary
for
the
little
tad
she
would
be
delighted
to
see
the
two
boys
besides
vanamee
must
see
how
the
little
tad
had
grown
since
he
last
set
eyes
on
her
would
know
her
for
the
same
little
girl
and
the
beer
had
been
on
ice
since
morning
presley
and
vanamee
could
not
well
refuse
they
climbed
into
the
wagon
and
jolted
over
the
uneven
ground
through
the
bare
forest
of
to
the
house
inside
they
found
dyke
an
old
lady
with
a
very
gentle
face
who
wore
a
cap
and
a
very
gown
with
hoop
skirts
dusting
the
in
a
corner
of
the
parlor
the
two
men
were
presented
and
the
beer
was
had
from
off
the
ice
mother
said
dyke
as
he
wiped
the
froth
from
his
great
blond
beard
ai
sid
anywheres
about
i
want
vanamee
to
see
how
she
has
grown
smartest
little
tad
in
tulare
county
boys
can
recite
the
whole
of
bound
end
to
end
without
skipping
or
looking
at
the
book
maybe
you
do
believe
that
mother
ai
i
right
without
skipping
a
line
hey
dyke
nodded
to
say
that
it
was
so
but
explained
that
sidney
was
in
guadalajara
in
putting
on
her
new
slippers
for
the
first
time
the
morning
before
she
had
found
a
dime
in
the
toe
of
one
of
them
and
had
had
the
whole
house
by
the
ears
ever
since
till
she
could
spend
it
was
it
for
licorice
to
make
her
licorice
water
inquired
dyke
gravely
yes
said
dyke
i
made
her
tell
me
what
she
was
going
to
get
before
she
went
and
it
was
dyke
though
his
mother
protested
that
he
was
foolish
and
that
presley
and
vanamee
had
no
great
interest
in
young
ones
insisted
upon
showing
the
visitors
sidney
they
were
monuments
of
laborious
elaborate
neatness
the
trite
moralities
and
aphorisms
of
the
philanthropists
and
publicists
repeated
from
page
to
page
with
wearying
insistence
i
too
am
an
american
citizen
as
the
twig
is
bent
the
tree
is
inclined
truth
crushed
to
earth
will
rise
again
as
for
me
give
me
liberty
or
give
me
death
and
last
of
all
a
strange
intrusion
amongst
the
mild
phrases
two
legends
my
motto
public
control
of
public
franchises
and
the
and
is
an
enemy
of
the
i
see
commented
presley
you
mean
the
little
tad
to
understand
situation
i
told
him
he
was
foolish
to
give
that
to
sid
to
copy
said
dyke
with
indulgent
remonstrance
what
can
she
understand
of
public
franchises
never
mind
observed
dyke
she
remember
it
when
she
grows
up
and
when
the
seminary
people
have
rubbed
her
up
a
bit
and
then
begin
to
ask
questions
and
understand
and
do
you
make
any
mistake
mother
he
went
on
about
the
little
tad
not
knowing
who
her
enemies
are
what
do
you
think
boys
listen
here
precious
little
ever
told
her
of
the
railroad
or
how
i
was
turned
off
but
the
other
day
i
was
working
down
by
the
fence
next
the
railroad
tracks
and
sid
was
there
she
brought
her
doll
rags
down
and
she
was
playing
house
behind
a
pile
of
hop
poles
well
along
comes
a
through
freight
mixed
train
from
missouri
points
and
a
string
of
empties
from
new
orleans
and
when
it
had
passed
what
do
you
suppose
the
tad
did
she
did
know
i
was
watching
her
she
goes
to
the
fence
and
spits
a
little
spit
after
the
caboose
and
puts
out
her
little
head
and
if
you
believe
me
hisses
at
the
train
and
mother
says
she
does
that
same
every
time
she
sees
a
train
go
by
and
never
crosses
the
tracks
that
she
do
spit
her
little
spit
on
what
do
you
think
of
that
but
i
correct
her
every
time
protested
dyke
seriously
where
she
picked
up
the
trick
of
hissing
i
do
know
no
it
not
funny
it
seems
dreadful
to
see
a
little
girl
who
as
sweet
and
gentle
as
can
be
in
every
other
way
so
venomous
she
says
the
other
little
girls
at
school
and
the
boys
too
are
all
the
same
way
oh
dear
she
sighed
why
will
the
general
office
be
so
unkind
and
unjust
why
i
be
happy
with
all
the
money
in
the
world
if
i
thought
that
even
one
little
child
hated
me
hated
me
so
that
it
would
spit
and
hiss
at
me
and
it
not
one
child
it
all
of
them
so
sidney
says
and
think
of
all
the
grown
people
who
hate
the
road
women
and
men
the
whole
county
the
whole
state
thousands
and
thousands
of
people
do
the
managers
and
the
directors
of
the
road
ever
think
of
that
do
they
ever
think
of
all
the
hate
that
surrounds
them
everywhere
everywhere
and
the
good
people
that
just
grit
their
teeth
when
the
name
of
the
road
is
mentioned
why
do
they
want
to
make
the
people
hate
them
no
she
murmured
the
tears
starting
to
her
eyes
no
i
tell
you
presley
the
men
who
own
the
railroad
are
wicked
men
who
do
care
how
much
the
poor
people
suffer
so
long
as
the
road
makes
its
eighteen
million
a
year
they
do
care
whether
the
people
hate
them
or
love
them
just
so
long
as
they
are
afraid
of
them
it
not
right
and
god
will
punish
them
sooner
or
a
little
after
this
the
two
young
men
took
themselves
away
dyke
obligingly
carrying
them
in
the
wagon
as
far
as
the
gate
that
opened
into
the
quien
sabe
ranch
on
the
way
presley
referred
to
what
dyke
had
said
and
led
dyke
himself
to
speak
of
the
and
well
dyke
said
it
like
this
presley
i
personally
got
the
right
to
kick
with
you
people
i
guess
different
but
hops
you
see
do
count
for
much
in
the
state
such
a
little
business
that
the
road
do
want
to
bother
themselves
to
tax
it
it
the
wheat
growers
that
the
road
cinches
the
rates
on
hops
are
fair
i
got
to
admit
that
i
was
in
to
bonneville
a
while
ago
to
find
out
it
two
cents
a
pound
and
lord
love
you
that
reasonable
enough
to
suit
any
man
no
he
concluded
i
on
the
way
to
make
money
now
the
road
sacking
me
as
they
did
was
maybe
a
good
thing
for
me
after
all
it
came
just
at
the
right
time
i
had
a
bit
of
money
put
by
and
here
was
the
chance
to
go
into
hops
with
the
certainty
that
hops
would
quadruple
and
quintuple
in
price
inside
the
year
no
it
was
my
chance
and
though
they
did
mean
it
by
a
long
chalk
the
railroad
people
did
me
a
good
turn
when
they
gave
me
my
time
and
the
enter
the
seminary
next
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
they
had
said
goodbye
to
the
engineer
presley
and
vanamee
tramping
briskly
along
the
road
that
led
northward
through
quien
sabe
arrived
at
annixter
ranch
house
at
once
they
were
aware
of
a
vast
and
unwonted
bustle
that
revolved
about
the
place
they
stopped
a
few
moments
looking
on
amused
and
interested
in
what
was
going
forward
the
colossal
barn
was
finished
its
freshly
sides
glared
intolerably
in
the
sun
but
its
interior
was
as
yet
innocent
of
paint
and
through
the
yawning
vent
of
the
sliding
doors
came
a
delicious
odour
of
new
fresh
wood
and
shavings
a
crowd
of
men
annixter
farm
hands
were
swarming
all
about
it
some
were
balanced
on
the
topmost
rounds
of
ladders
hanging
festoons
of
japanese
lanterns
from
tree
to
tree
and
all
across
the
front
of
the
barn
itself
tree
her
daughter
hilma
and
another
woman
were
inside
the
barn
cutting
into
long
strips
bolt
after
bolt
of
red
white
and
blue
cambric
and
directing
how
these
strips
should
be
draped
from
the
ceiling
and
on
the
walls
everywhere
resounded
the
tapping
of
tack
hammers
a
farm
wagon
drove
up
loaded
to
overflowing
with
evergreens
and
with
great
bundles
of
palm
leaves
and
these
were
immediately
seized
upon
and
affixed
as
supplementary
decorations
to
the
cambric
upon
the
inside
walls
of
the
barn
two
of
the
larger
evergreen
trees
were
placed
on
either
side
the
barn
door
and
their
tops
bent
over
to
form
an
arch
in
the
middle
of
this
arch
it
was
proposed
to
hang
a
mammoth
pasteboard
escutcheon
with
gold
letters
spelling
the
word
welcome
piles
of
chairs
rented
from
hall
in
bonneville
heaped
themselves
in
an
apparently
hopeless
entanglement
on
the
ground
while
at
the
far
extremity
of
the
barn
a
couple
of
carpenters
clattered
about
the
impromptu
staging
which
was
to
accommodate
the
band
there
was
a
strenuous
gayety
in
the
air
everybody
was
in
the
best
of
spirits
notes
of
laughter
continually
interrupted
the
conversation
on
every
hand
at
every
moment
a
group
of
men
involved
themselves
in
uproarious
they
passed
oblique
jokes
behind
their
hands

for
the

bellowed
with
laughter
thereat
stamping
on
the
ground
the
relations
between
the
sexes
grew
more
intimate
the
women
and
girls
pushing
the
young
fellows
away
from
their
sides
with
vigorous
thrusts
of
their
elbows
it
was
passed
from
group
to
group
that
adela
vacca
a
division
superintendent
wife
had
lost
her
garter
the
daughter
of
the
foreman
of
the
home
ranch
was
kissed
behind
the
door
of
the
annixter
in
execrable
temper
appeared
from
time
to
time
hatless
his
stiff
yellow
hair
in
wild
disorder
he
hurried
between
the
barn
and
the
ranch
house
carrying
now
a
wickered
demijohn
now
a
case
of
wine
now
a
basket
of
lemons
and
pineapples
besides
general
supervision
he
had
elected
to
assume
the
responsibility
of
composing
the
punch
something
stiff
by
jingo
a
punch
that
would
raise
you
right
out
of
your
boots
a
regular
hairlifter
the
harness
room
of
the
barn
he
had
set
apart
for
himself
and
intimates
he
had
brought
a
long
table
down
from
the
house
and
upon
it
had
set
out
boxes
of
cigars
bottles
of
whiskey
and
of
beer
and
the
great
china
bowls
for
the
punch
it
would
be
no
fault
of
his
he
declared
if
half
the
number
of
his
men
friends
were
not
uproarious
before
they
left
his
barn
dance
would
be
the
talk
of
all
tulare
county
for
years
to
come
for
this
one
day
he
had
resolved
to
put
all
thoughts
of
business
out
of
his
head
for
the
matter
of
that
things
were
going
well
enough
osterman
was
back
from
los
angeles
with
a
favourable
report
as
to
his
affair
with
disbrow
and
darrell
there
had
been
another
meeting
of
the
committee
harran
derrick
had
attended
though
he
had
taken
no
part
in
the
discussion
annixter
was
satisfied
the
governor
had
consented
to
allow
harran
to
come
in
if
he
so
desired
and
harran
had
pledged
himself
to
share
of
the
campaign
expenses
providing
these
did
not
exceed
a
certain
figure
as
annixter
came
to
the
door
of
the
barn
to
shout
abuse
at
the
distraught
chinese
cook
who
was
cutting
up
lemons
in
the
kitchen
he
caught
sight
of
presley
and
vanamee
and
hailed
them
hello
pres
he
called
come
over
here
and
see
how
she
looks
he
indicated
the
barn
with
a
movement
of
his
head
well
we
getting
ready
for
you
tonight
he
went
on
as
the
two
friends
came
up
but
how
we
are
going
to
get
straightened
out
by
eight
i
do
know
would
you
believe
that
pip
caraher
is
short
of
lemons
at
this
last
minute
and
i
told
him
i
want
three
cases
of
as
much
as
a
month
ago
and
here
just
when
i
want
a
good
lively
saddle
horse
to
get
around
on
somebody
hikes
the
buckskin
out
the
corral
stole
her
by
jingo
i
have
the
law
on
that
thief
if
it
breaks
me
and
a
saddle
gone
with
her
and
only
about
half
the
number
of
jap
lanterns
that
i
ordered
have
shown
up
and
not
candles
enough
for
those
it
enough
to
make
a
dog
sick
there
nothing
done
that
you
do
do
yourself
unless
you
stand
over
these
loafers
with
a
club
sick
of
the
whole
business
and
i
lost
my
hat
wish
to
god
i
never
dreamed
of
givin
this
rotten
fool
dance
clutter
the
whole
place
up
with
a
lot
of
feemales
i
sure
did
lose
my
presence
of
mind
when
i
got
that
then
ignoring
the
fact
that
it
was
he
himself
who
had
called
the
young
men
to
him
he
added
well
this
is
my
busy
day
sorry
i
ca
stop
and
talk
to
you
he
shouted
a
last
imprecation
at
the
chinaman
and
turned
back
into
the
barn
presley
and
vanamee
went
on
but
annixter
as
he
crossed
the
floor
of
the
barn
all
but
collided
with
hilma
tree
who
came
out
from
one
of
the
stalls
a
box
of
candles
in
her
arms
gasping
out
an
apology
annixter
reentered
the
harness
room
closing
the
door
behind
him
and
forgetting
all
the
responsibility
of
the
moment
lit
a
cigar
and
sat
down
in
one
of
the
hired
chairs
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
feet
on
the
table
frowning
thoughtfully
through
the
blue
smoke
annixter
was
at
last
driven
to
confess
to
himself
that
he
could
not
get
the
thought
of
hilma
tree
out
of
his
mind
finally
she
had
got
a
hold
on
the
thing
that
of
all
others
he
most
dreaded
had
happened
a
feemale
girl
had
got
a
hold
on
him
and
now
there
was
no
longer
for
him
any
such
thing
as
peace
of
mind
the
idea
of
the
young
woman
was
with
him
continually
he
went
to
bed
with
it
he
got
up
with
it
at
every
moment
of
the
day
he
was
pestered
with
it
it
interfered
with
his
work
got
mixed
up
in
his
business
what
a
miserable
confession
for
a
man
to
make
a
fine
way
to
waste
his
time
was
it
possible
that
only
the
other
day
he
had
stood
in
front
of
the
music
store
in
bonneville
and
seriously
considered
making
hilma
a
present
of
a
even
now
the
very
thought
of
it
made
him
flush
with
shame
and
this
after
she
had
told
him
plainly
that
she
did
not
like
him
he
was
running
after
her
he
annixter
he
ripped
out
a
furious
oath
striking
the
table
with
his
boot
heel
again
and
again
he
had
resolved
to
put
the
whole
affair
from
out
his
mind
once
he
had
been
able
to
do
so
but
of
late
it
was
becoming
harder
and
harder
with
every
successive
day
he
had
only
to
close
his
eyes
to
see
her
as
plain
as
if
she
stood
before
him
he
saw
her
in
a
glory
of
sunlight
that
set
a
fine
tinted
lustre
of
pale
carnation
and
gold
on
the
silken
sheen
of
her
white
skin
her
hair
sparkled
with
it
her
thick
strong
neck
sloping
to
her
shoulders
with
beautiful
full
curves
seemed
to
radiate
the
light
her
eyes
brown
wide
innocent
in
expression
disclosing
the
full
disc
of
the
pupil
upon
the
slightest
provocation
flashed
in
this
sunlight
like
diamonds
annixter
was
all
bewildered
with
the
exception
of
the
timid
little
creature
in
the
establishment
in
sacramento
he
had
had
no
acquaintance
with
any
woman
his
world
was
harsh
crude
a
world
of
men
only
men
who
were
to
be
combatted
opposed
his
hand
was
against
nearly
every
one
of
them
women
he
distrusted
with
the
instinctive
distrust
of
the
overgrown
schoolboy
now
at
length
a
young
woman
had
come
into
his
life
promptly
he
was
struck
with
discomfiture
annoyed
almost
beyond
endurance
harassed
bedevilled
excited
made
angry
and
exasperated
he
was
suspicious
of
the
woman
yet
desired
her
totally
ignorant
of
how
to
approach
her
hating
the
sex
yet
drawn
to
the
individual
confusing
the
two
emotions
sometimes
even
hating
hilma
as
a
result
of
this
confusion
but
at
all
times
disturbed
vexed
irritated
beyond
power
of
expression
at
length
annixter
cast
his
cigar
from
him
and
plunged
again
into
the
work
of
the
day
the
afternoon
wore
to
evening
to
the
accompaniment
of
wearying
and
clamorous
endeavour
in
some
unexplained
fashion
the
labour
of
putting
the
great
barn
in
readiness
for
the
dance
was
accomplished
the
last
bolt
of
cambric
was
hung
in
place
from
the
rafters
the
last
evergreen
tree
was
nailed
to
the
joists
of
the
walls
the
last
lantern
hung
the
last
nail
driven
into
the
platform
the
sun
set
there
was
a
great
scurry
to
have
supper
and
dress
annixter
last
of
all
the
other
workers
left
the
barn
in
the
dusk
of
twilight
he
was
alone
he
had
a
saw
under
one
arm
a
bag
of
tools
was
in
his
hand
he
was
in
his
shirt
sleeves
and
carried
his
coat
over
his
shoulder
a
hammer
was
thrust
into
one
of
his
hip
pockets
he
was
in
execrable
temper
the
day
work
had
fagged
him
out
he
had
not
been
able
to
find
his
hat
and
the
buckskin
with
sixty
dollars
worth
of
saddle
gone
too
he
groaned
oh
ai
it
sweet
at
his
house
tree
had
set
out
a
cold
supper
for
him
the
inevitable
dish
of
prunes
serving
as
dessert
after
supper
annixter
bathed
and
dressed
he
decided
at
the
last
moment
to
wear
his
usual
suit
a
sack
suit
of
black
made
by
a
bonneville
tailor
but
his
hat
was
gone
there
were
other
hats
he
might
have
worn
but
because
this
particular
one
was
lost
he
fretted
about
it
all
through
his
dressing
and
then
decided
to
have
one
more
look
around
the
barn
for
it
for
over
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
pottered
about
the
barn
going
from
stall
to
stall
rummaging
the
harness
room
and
feed
room
all
to
no
purpose
at
last
he
came
out
again
upon
the
main
floor
definitely
giving
up
the
search
looking
about
him
to
see
if
everything
was
in
order
the
festoons
of
japanese
lanterns
in
and
around
the
barn
were
not
yet
lighted
but
some
lamps
with
great
tin
reflectors
that
hung
against
the
walls
were
burning
low
a
dull
half
light
pervaded
the
vast
interior
hollow
echoing
leaving
the
corners
and
roof
thick
with
impenetrable
black
shadows
the
barn
faced
the
west
and
through
the
open
sliding
doors
was
streaming
a
single
bright
bar
from
the
incongruous
and
out
of
all
harmony
with
the
dull
flare
of
the
kerosene
lamps
as
annixter
glanced
about
him
he
saw
a
figure
step
briskly
out
of
the
shadows
of
one
corner
of
the
building
pause
for
the
fraction
of
one
instant
in
the
bar
of
light
then
at
sight
of
him
dart
back
again
there
was
a
sound
of
hurried
footsteps
annixter
with
recollections
of
the
stolen
buckskin
in
his
mind
cried
out
sharply
who
there
there
was
no
answer
in
a
second
his
pistol
was
in
his
hand
who
there
quick
speak
up
or
i
no
no
no
do
shoot
cried
an
answering
voice
oh
be
careful
it
i
hilma
annixter
slid
the
pistol
into
his
pocket
with
a
great
qualm
of
apprehension
he
came
forward
and
met
hilma
in
the
doorway
good
lord
he
murmured
that
sure
did
give
me
a
start
if
i
had
shot
hilma
stood
abashed
and
confused
before
him
she
was
dressed
in
a
white
organdie
frock
of
the
most
rigorous
simplicity
and
wore
neither
flower
nor
ornament
the
severity
of
her
dress
made
her
look
even
larger
than
usual
and
even
as
it
was
her
eyes
were
on
a
level
with
annixter
there
was
a
certain
fascination
in
the
contradiction
of
stature
and
character
of
hilma
a
great
girl
as
yet
but
tall
as
a
man
for
all
that
there
was
a
moment
awkward
silence
then
hilma
explained
i
i
came
back
to
look
for
my
hat
i
thought
i
left
it
here
this
and
i
was
looking
for
my
hat
cried
annixter
funny
enough
hey
they
laughed
at
this
as
heartily
as
children
might
have
done
the
constraint
of
the
situation
was
a
little
relaxed
and
annixter
with
sudden
directness
glanced
sharply
at
the
young
woman
and
demanded
well
miss
hilma
hate
me
as
much
as
ever
oh
no
sir
she
answered
i
never
said
i
hated
well
dislike
me
then
i
know
you
said
i
i
disliked
what
you
did
tried
to
do
it
made
me
angry
and
it
hurt
me
i
should
have
said
what
i
did
that
time
but
it
was
your
you
mean
you
should
have
said
you
did
like
me
asked
annixter
why
well
well
i
do
i
do
dislike
anybody
admitted
hilma
then
i
can
take
it
that
you
do
dislike
me
is
that
it
i
do
dislike
anybody
persisted
hilma
well
i
asked
you
more
than
that
did
i
queried
annixter
uneasily
i
asked
you
to
like
me
remember
the
other
day
i
asking
you
that
again
now
i
want
you
to
like
hilma
lifted
her
eyes
inquiringly
to
his
in
her
words
was
an
unmistakable
ring
of
absolute
sincerity
innocently
she
inquired
why
annixter
was
struck
speechless
in
the
face
of
such
candour
such
perfect
ingenuousness
he
was
at
a
loss
for
any
words
well
well
he
stammered
well
i
do
know
he
suddenly
burst
out
that
is
he
went
on
groping
for
his
wits
i
ca
quite
say
the
idea
of
a
colossal
lie
occurred
to
him
a
thing
actually
royal
i
like
to
have
the
people
who
are
around
me
like
me
he
declared
i
i
like
to
be
popular
understand
yes
that
it
he
continued
more
reassured
i
do
like
the
idea
of
any
one
disliking
me
the
way
i
am
it
my
oh
then
returned
hilma
you
need
bother
no
i
do
dislike
well
that
good
declared
annixter
judicially
that
good
but
hold
on
he
interrupted
i
forgetting
it
not
enough
to
not
dislike
me
i
want
you
to
like
me
how
about
that
hilma
paused
for
a
moment
glancing
vaguely
out
of
the
doorway
toward
the
lighted
window
of
the
her
head
tilted
i
do
know
that
i
ever
thought
about
that
she
said
well
think
about
it
now
insisted
annixter
but
i
never
thought
about
liking
anybody
particularly
she
observed
it
because
i
like
everybody
do
you
see
well
you
got
to
like
some
people
more
than
other
people
hazarded
annixter
and
i
want
to
be
one
of
those
people
savvy
good
lord
i
do
know
how
to
say
these
fool
things
i
talk
like
a
galoot
when
i
get
talking
to
feemale
girls
and
i
ca
lay
my
tongue
to
anything
that
sounds
right
it
is
my
nature
and
look
here
i
lied
when
i
said
i
liked
to
have
people
like
me
to
be
popular
rot
i
care
a
curse
about
people
opinions
of
me
but
there
a
few
people
that
are
more
to
me
than
most
others
that
chap
presley
for
instance
and
those
people
i
do
want
to
have
like
me
what
they
think
counts
pshaw
i
know
i
got
enemies
piles
of
them
i
could
name
you
half
a
dozen
men
right
now
that
are
naturally
itching
to
take
a
shot
at
me
how
about
this
ranch
do
i
know
ca
i
hear
the
men
growling
oaths
under
their
breath
after
i
gone
by
and
in
business
ways
too
he
went
on
speaking
half
to
himself
in
bonneville
and
all
over
the
county
there
not
a
man
of
them
would
howl
for
joy
if
they
got
a
chance
to
down
buck
annixter
think
i
care
why
i
like
it
i
run
my
ranch
to
suit
myself
and
i
play
my
game
my
own
way
i
a
i
know
it
and
a
too
oh
i
know
what
they
call
me
brute
beast
with
a
twist
in
my
temper
that
would
rile
up
a
lamb
and
i
and
and
they
say
all
that
but
they
got
to
say
too
that
i
cleverer
than
any
in
the
running
there
nobody
can
get
ahead
of
his
eyes
snapped
let
grind
their
teeth
they
ca
me
when
i
shut
my
fist
not
one
of
them
can
open
it
no
not
with
a
he
turned
to
hilma
again
well
when
a
man
hated
as
much
as
that
it
stands
to
reason
do
it
miss
hilma
that
the
few
friends
he
has
got
he
wants
to
keep
i
not
such
an
entire
swine
to
the
people
that
know
me
best
that
jackass
presley
for
instance
i
put
my
hand
in
the
fire
to
do
him
a
real
service
sometimes
i
get
kind
of
lonesome
wonder
if
you
would
understand
it
my
fault
but
there
not
a
horse
about
the
place
that
do
lay
his
ears
back
when
i
get
on
him
there
not
a
dog
do
put
his
tail
between
his
legs
as
soon
as
i
come
near
him
the
cayuse
foaled
yet
here
on
quien
sabe
that
can
throw
me
nor
the
dog
whelped
that
would
dare
show
his
teeth
at
me
i
kick
that
irish
setter
every
time
i
see
him
but
wonder
what
i
do
though
if
he
did
slink
so
much
if
he
wagged
his
tail
and
was
glad
to
see
me
so
it
all
comes
to
this
i
like
to
have
you
well
sort
of
feel
that
i
was
a
good
friend
of
yours
and
like
me
because
of
the
flame
in
the
lamp
on
the
wall
in
front
of
hilma
stretched
upward
tall
and
thin
and
began
to
smoke
she
went
over
to
where
the
lamp
hung
and
standing
on
lowered
the
wick
as
she
reached
her
hand
up
annixter
noted
how
the
sombre
lurid
red
of
the
lamp
made
a
warm
reflection
on
her
smooth
round
arm
do
you
understand
he
queried
yes
why
yes
she
answered
turning
around
it
very
good
of
you
to
want
to
be
a
friend
of
mine
i
did
think
so
though
when
you
tried
to
kiss
me
but
maybe
it
all
right
since
you
explained
things
you
see
i
different
from
you
i
like
everybody
to
like
me
and
i
like
to
like
everybody
it
makes
one
so
much
happier
you
would
believe
it
but
you
ought
to
try
it
sir
just
to
see
it
so
good
to
be
good
to
people
and
to
have
people
good
to
you
and
everybody

always
been
so
good
to
me
mamma
and
papa
of
course
and
billy
the
stableman
and
montalegre
the
portugee
foreman
and
the
chinese
cook
even
and
delaney
only
he
went
away
and
vacca
and
her
little
delaney
hey
demanded
annixter
abruptly
you
and
he
were
pretty
good
friends
were
you
oh
yes
she
answered
he
was
just
as
good
to
me
every
day
in
the
summer
time
he
used
to
ride
over
to
the
seed
ranch
back
of
the
mission
and
bring
me
a
great
armful
of
flowers
the
prettiest
things
and
i
used
to
pretend
to
pay
him
for
them
with
dollars
made
of
cheese
that
i
cut
out
of
the
cheese
with
a
biscuit
cutter
it
was
such
fun
we
were
the
best
of
there
another
lamp
smoking
growled
annixter
turn
it
down
will
you
and
see
that
somebody
sweeps
this
floor
here
it
all
littered
up
with
pine
needles
i
got
a
lot
to
do
annixter
returned
to
the
ranch
house
his
teeth
clenched
enraged
his
face
flushed
ah
he
muttered
delaney
hey
throwing
it
up
to
me
that
i
fired
his
teeth
gripped
together
more
fiercely
than
ever
the
best
of
friends
hey
by
god

have
that
girl
yet
i
show
that
ai
i
her
employer

her
and
delaney
too
it
would
be
easy
enough
and
then
delaney
can
have
her
if
he
wants
her
after
an
evil
light
flashing
from
under
his
scowl
spread
over
his
face
the
male
instincts
of
possession
unreasoned
treacherous
oblique
came
twisting
to
the
surface
all
the
lower
nature
of
the
man
ignorant
of
women
racked
at
one
and
the
same
time
with
enmity
and
desire
roused
itself
like
a
hideous
and
abominable
beast
and
at
the
same
moment
hilma
returned
to
her
house
humming
to
herself
as
she
walked
her
white
dress
glowing
with
a
shimmer
of
faint
saffron
light
in
the
last
ray
of
the
a
little
after
seven
the
first
bearing
the
druggist
of
bonneville
and
his
arrived
in
front
of
the
new
barn
immediately
afterward
an
express
wagon
loaded
down
with
a
swarming
family
of
gorgeous
in
red
and
yellow
colours
followed
billy
the
stableman
and
his
assistant
took
charge
of
the
teams
unchecking
the
horses
and
hitching
them
to
a
fence
back
of
the
barn
then
caraher
the
in
derby
hat
prince
albert
coat
pointed
yellow
shoes
and
inevitable
red
necktie
drove
into
the
yard
on
his
buckboard
the
delayed
box
of
lemons
under
the
seat
it
looked
as
if
the
whole
array
of
invited
guests
was
to
arrive
in
one
unbroken
procession
but
for
a
long
nobody
else
appeared
annixter
and
caraher
withdrew
to
the
harness
room
and
promptly
involved
themselves
in
a
wrangle
as
to
the
of
the
famous
punch
from
time
to
time
their
voices
could
be
heard
uplifted
in
clamorous
argument
two
quarts
and
a
half
and
a
cupful
of
rot
rot
i
know
better
champagne
straight
and
a
dash
of
the
druggist
wife
and
sister
retired
to
the
feed
room
where
a
bureau
with
a
swinging
mirror
had
been
placed
for
the
convenience
of
the
women
the
druggist
stood
awkwardly
outside
the
door
of
the
feed
room
his
coat
collar
turned
up
against
the
draughts
that
drifted
through
the
barn
his
face
troubled
debating
anxiously
as
to
the
propriety
of
putting
on
his
gloves
the
family
a
father
mother
and
five
children
and
sat
rigid
on
the
edges
of
the
hired
chairs
silent
constrained
their
eyes
lowered
their
elbows
in
at
their
sides
glancing
furtively
from
under
their
eyebrows
at
the
decorations
or
watching
with
intense
absorption
young
vacca
son
of
one
of
the
division
superintendents
who
wore
a
checked
coat
and
white
thread
gloves
and
who
paced
up
and
down
the
length
of
the
barn
frowning
very
important
whittling
a
wax
candle
over
the
floor
to
make
it
slippery
for
dancing
the
musicians
arrived
the
city
band
of
bonneville
annixter
having
managed
to
offend
the
leader
of
the
dirigo
club
orchestra
at
the
very
last
moment
to
such
a
point
that
he
had
refused
his
services
these
members
of
the
city
band
repaired
at
once
to
their
platform
in
the
corner
at
every
instant
they
laughed
uproariously
among
themselves
joshing
one
of
their
number
a
frenchman
whom
they
called
their
hilarity
reverberated
in
a
hollow
metallic
roll
among
the
rafters
overhead
the
druggist
observed
to
young
vacca
as
he
passed
by
that
he
thought
them
pretty
fresh
just
the
same
i
busy
i
very
busy
returned
the
young
man
continuing
on
his
way
still
frowning
and
paring
the
stump
of
candle
two
quarts
a
half
two
quarts
a
ah
yes
in
a
way
that
so
and
then
again
in
a
way
it
is
i
know
all
along
one
side
of
the
barn
were
a
row
of
stalls
fourteen
of
them
clean
as
yet
redolent
of
new
cut
wood
the
sawdust
still
in
the
cracks
of
the
flooring
deliberately
the
druggist
went
from
one
to
the
other
pausing
contemplatively
before
each
he
returned
down
the
line
and
again
took
up
his
position
by
the
door
of
the
feed
room
nodding
his
head
judicially
as
if
satisfied
he
decided
to
put
on
his
gloves
by
now
it
was
quite
dark
outside
between
the
barn
and
the
ranch
houses
one
could
see
a
group
of
men
on
lighting
the
festoons
of
japanese
lanterns
in
the
darkness
only
their
faces
appeared
here
and
there
high
above
the
ground
seen
in
a
haze
of
red
strange
grotesque
gradually
as
the
multitude
of
lanterns
were
lit
the
light
spread
the
grass
underfoot
looked
like
green
excelsior
another
group
of
men
invaded
the
barn
itself
lighting
the
lamps
and
lanterns
there
soon
the
whole
place
was
gleaming
with
points
of
light
young
vacca
who
had
disappeared
returned
with
his
pockets
full
of
wax
candles
he
resumed
his
whittling
refusing
to
answer
any
questions
vociferating
that
he
was
busy
outside
there
was
a
sound
of
hoofs
and
voices
more
guests
had
arrived
the
druggist
seized
with
confusion
terrified
lest
he
had
put
on
his
gloves
too
soon
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
it
was
cutter
magnus
derrick
division
superintendent
who
came
bringing
his
wife
and
her
two
girl
cousins
they
had
come
fifteen
miles
by
the
trail
from
the
far
distant
division
house
on
four
of
los
muertos
and
had
ridden
on
horseback
instead
of
driving
cutter
could
be
heard
declaring
that
she
was
nearly
dead
and
felt
more
like
going
to
bed
than
dancing
the
two
girl
cousins
in
dresses
of
dotted
swiss
over
blue
sateen
were
doing
their
utmost
to
pacify
her
she
could
be
heard
protesting
from
moment
to
moment
one
distinguished
the
phrases
straight
to
my
bed
back
nearly
broken
in
two
never
wanted
to
come
in
the
first
the
druggist
observing
cutter
take
a
pair
of
gloves
from
reticule
drew
his
hands
from
his
pockets
but
abruptly
there
was
an
interruption
in
the
musicians
corner
a
scuffle
broke
out
a
chair
was
overturned
there
was
a
noise
of
imprecations
mingled
with
shouts
of
derision
skeezicks
the
frenchman
had
turned
upon
the
joshers
ah
no
he
was
heard
to
exclaim
at
the
end
of
the
end
it
is
too
much
kind
of
a
bad
canary

will
go
to
see
about
that
aha
let
him
close
up
his
face
before
i
demolish
it
with
a
good
stroke
of
the
the
men
who
were
lighting
the
lanterns
were
obliged
to
intervene
before
he
could
be
placated

and
his
wife

with
her
black

pale

very
red

was

long
the
shoulders
absurdly
too
wide
he
and

at
once
entered
into
an
excited
conversation
as
to
the
ownership

two

a
half
two
quarts
a
i
know
better
that
all
but
the
barn
was
filling
up
rapidly
at
every
moment
there
was
a
rattle
of
a
newly
arrived
vehicle
from
outside
guest
after
guest
appeared
in
the
doorway
singly
or
in
couples
or
in
families
or
in
garrulous
parties
of
five
and
six
now
it
was
phelps
and
his
mother
from
los
muertos
now
a
foreman
from
broderson
with
his
family
now
a
gayly
apparelled
clerk
from
a
bonneville
store
solitary
and
bewildered
looking
for
a
place
to
put
his
hat
now
a
couple
of
girls
from
guadalajara
with
coquettish
effects
of
black
and
yellow
about
their
dress
now
a
group
of
osterman
tenants
portuguese
swarthy
with
plastered
hair
and
curled
mustaches
redolent
of
cheap
perfumes
sarria
arrived
his
smooth
shiny
face
glistening
with
perspiration
he
wore
a
new
cassock
and
carried
his
hat
under
his
arm
his
appearance
made
quite
a
stir
he
passed
from
group
to
group
urbane
affable
shaking
hands
right
and
left
he
assumed
a
set
smile
of
amiability
which
never
left
his
face
the
whole
evening
but
abruptly
there
was
a
veritable
sensation
from
out
the
little
crowd
that
persistently
huddled
about
the
doorway
came
osterman
he
wore
a
with
a
white
waistcoat
and
patent
leather
pumps
what
a
wonder
a
little
qualm
of
excitement
spread
around
the
barn
one
exchanged
nudges
of
the
elbow
with
one
neighbour
whispering
earnestly
behind
the
hand
what
astonishing
clothes
catch
on
to
the
it
was
a
masquerade
costume
maybe
that
goat
osterman
was
such
a
josher
one
never
could
tell
what
he
would
do
next
the
musicians
began
to
tune
up
from
their
corner
came
a
medley
of
mellow
sounds
the
subdued
chirps
of
the
violins
the
dull
bourdon
of
the
bass
viol
the
liquid
gurgling
of
the
flageolet
and
the
snarl
of
the
big
horn
with
now
and
then
a
rasping
stridulating
of
the
snare
drum
a
sense
of
gayety
began
to
spread
throughout
the
assembly
at
every
moment
the
crowd
increased
the
aroma
of
timber
and
sawdust
began
to
be
mingled
with
the
feminine
odour
of
sachet
and
flowers
there
was
a
babel
of
talk
in
the
air
male
baritone
and
soprano
chatter
varied
by
an
occasional
note
of
laughter
and
the
swish
of
stiffly
starched
petticoats
on
the
row
of
chairs
that
went
around
three
sides
of
the
wall
groups
began
to
settle
themselves
for
a
long
time
the
guests
huddled
close
to
the
doorway
the
lower
end
of
the
floor
was
crowded
the
upper
end
deserted
but
by
degrees
the
lines
of
white
muslin
and
pink
and
blue
sateen
extended
dotted
with
the
darker
figures
of
men
in
black
suits
the
conversation
grew
louder
as
the
timidity
of
the
early
moments
wore
off
groups
at
a
distance
called
back
and
forth
conversations
were
carried
on
at
top
voice
once
even
a
whole
party
hurried
across
the
floor
from
one
side
of
the
barn
to
the
other
annixter
emerged
from
the
harness
room
his
face
red
with
wrangling
he
took
a
position
to
the
right
of
the
door
shaking
hands
with
newcomers
inviting
them
over
and
over
again
to
cut
loose
and
whoop
it
along
into
the
ears
of
his
more
intimate
male
acquaintances
he
dropped
a
word
as
to
punch
and
cigars
in
the
harness
room
later
on
winking
with
vast
intelligence
ranchers
from
remoter
parts
of
the
country
appeared
garnett
from
the
ruby
rancho
keast
from
the
ranch
of
the
same
name
gethings
of
the
san
pablo
chattern
of
the
bonanza
and
others
and
still
others
a
score
of
them
elderly
men
for
the
most
part
bearded
slow
of
speech
deliberate
dressed
in
broadcloth
old
broderson
who
entered
with
his
wife
on
his
arm
fell
in
with
this
type
and
with
them
came
a
certain
dabney
of
whom
nothing
but
his
name
was
known
a
silent
old
man
who
made
no
friends
whom
nobody
knew
or
spoke
to
who
was
seen
only
upon
such
occasions
as
this
coming
from
no
one
knew
where
going
no
one
cared
to
inquire
whither
between
eight
and
magnus
derrick
and
his
family
were
seen
magnus
entry
caused
no
little
impression
some
said
there
the
governor
and
called
their
companions
attention
to
the
thin
erect
figure
commanding
imposing
dominating
all
in
his
immediate
neighbourhood
harran
came
with
him
wearing
a
suit
of
black
he
was
undeniably
handsome
young
and
fresh
looking
his
cheeks
highly
coloured
quite
the
finest
looking
of
all
the
younger
men
blond
strong
with
that
certain
courtliness
of
manner
that
had
always
made
him
liked
he
took
his
mother
upon
his
arm
and
conducted
her
to
a
seat
by
the
side
of
broderson
annie
derrick
was
very
pretty
that
evening
she
was
dressed
in
a
grey
silk
gown
with
a
collar
of
pink
velvet
her
light
brown
hair
that
yet
retained
so
much
of
its
brightness
was
transfixed
by
a
high
shell
comb
very
spanish
but
the
look
of
uneasiness
in
her
large
eyes
the
eyes
of
a
young
girl
was
deepening
every
day
the
expression
of
innocence
and
inquiry
which
they
so
easily
assumed
was
disturbed
by
a
faint
suggestion
of
aversion
almost
of
terror
she
settled
herself
in
her
place
in
the
corner
of
the
hall
in
the
rear
rank
of
chairs
a
little
frightened
by
the
glare
of
lights
the
hum
of
talk
and
the
shifting
crowd
glad
to
be
out
of
the
way
to
attract
no
attention
willing
to
obliterate
herself
all
at
once
annixter
who
had
just
shaken
hands
with
dyke
his
mother
and
the
little
tad
moved
abruptly
in
his
place
drawing
in
his
breath
sharply
the
crowd
around
the
great
main
door
of
the
barn
had
somewhat
thinned
out
and
in
the
few
groups
that
still
remained
there
he
had
suddenly
recognised
and
tree
and
hilma
making
their
way
towards
some
empty
seats
near
the
entrance
of
the
feed
room
in
the
dusky
light
of
the
barn
earlier
in
the
evening
annixter
had
not
been
able
to
see
hilma
plainly
now
however
as
she
passed
before
his
eyes
in
the
glittering
radiance
of
the
lamps
and
lanterns
he
caught
his
breath
in
astonishment
never
had
she
appeared
more
beautiful
in
his
eyes
it
did
not
seem
possible
that
this
was
the
same
girl
whom
he
saw
every
day
in
and
around
the
ranch
house
and
dairy
the
girl
of
simple
calico
frocks
and
plain
shirt
waists
who
brought
him
his
dinner
who
made
up
his
bed
now
he
could
not
take
his
eyes
from
her
hilma
for
the
first
time
was
wearing
her
hair
done
high
upon
her
head
the
thick
masses
bitumen
brown
in
the
shadows
corruscated
like
golden
filaments
in
the
light
her
organdie
frock
was
long
longer
than
any
she
had
yet
worn
it
left
a
little
of
her
neck
and
breast
bare
and
all
of
her
arm
annixter
muttered
an
exclamation
such
arms
how
did
she
manage
to
keep
them
hid
on
ordinary
occasions
big
at
the
shoulder
tapering
with
delicious
modulations
to
the
elbow
and
wrist
overlaid
with
a
delicate
gleaming
lustre
as
often
as
she
turned
her
head
the
movement
sent
a
slow
undulation
over
her
neck
and
shoulders
the
pale
shadows
under
her
chin
coming
and
going
over
the
creamy
whiteness
of
the
skin
like
the
changing
moire
of
silk
the
pretty
rose
colour
of
her
cheek
had
deepened
to
a
pale
carnation
annixter
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
stood
watching
in
a
few
moments
hilma
was
surrounded
by
a
group
of
young
men
clamouring
for
dances
they
came
from
all
corners
of
the
barn
leaving
the
other
girls
precipitately
almost
rudely
there
could
be
little
doubt
as
to
who
was
to
be
the
belle
of
the
occasion
hilma
little
triumph
was
immediate
complete
annixter
could
hear
her
voice
from
time
to
time
its
usual
velvety
huskiness
vibrating
to
a
note
of
exuberant
gayety
all
at
once
the
orchestra
swung
off
into
a
march
the
grand
march
there
was
a
great
rush
to
secure
young
vacca
still
going
the
rounds
was
pushed
to
one
side
the
gayly
apparelled
clerk
from
the
bonneville
store
lost
his
head
in
the
confusion
he
could
not
find
his
he
roamed
wildly
about
the
barn
bewildered
his
eyes
rolling
he
resolved
to
prepare
an
elaborate
programme
card
on
the
back
of
an
old
envelope
rapidly
the
line
was
formed
hilma
and
harran
derrick
in
the
lead
annixter
having
obstinately
refused
to
engage
in
either
march
set
or
dance
the
whole
evening
soon
the
confused
shuffling
of
feet
settled
to
a
measured
cadence
the
orchestra
blared
and
wailed
the
snare
drum
rolling
at
exact
intervals
the
cornet
marking
the
time
it
was
eight
annixter
drew
a
long
breath
good
he
muttered
the
thing
is
under
way
at
singularly
enough
osterman
also
refused
to
dance
the
week
before
he
had
returned
from
los
angeles
bursting
with
the
importance
of
his
mission
he
had
been
successful
he
had
disbrow
in
his
he
was
impatient
to
pose
before
the
others
of
the
committee
as
a
skilful
political
agent
a
manipulator
he
forgot
his
attitude
of
the
early
part
of
the
evening
when
he
had
drawn
attention
to
himself
with
his
wonderful
clothes
now
his
comic
actor
face
with
its
cheeks
protuberant
ears
and
horizontal
slit
of
a
mouth
was
overcast
with
gravity
his
bald
forehead
was
seamed
with
the
wrinkles
of
responsibility
he
drew
annixter
into
one
of
the
empty
stalls
and
began
an
elaborate
explanation
glib
voluble
interminable
going
over
again
in
detail
what
he
had
reported
to
the
committee
in
outline
i
managed
i
schemed
i
kept
dark
i
lay
low
but
annixter
refused
to
listen
oh
rot
your
schemes
there
a
punch
in
the
harness
room
that
will
make
the
hair
grow
on
the
top
of
your
head
in
the
place
where
the
hair
ought
to
grow
come
on
we
round
up
some
of
the
boys
and
walk
into
they
edged
their
way
around
the
hall
outside
the
grand
march
toward
the
harness
room
picking
up
on
their
way
caraher
dyke
hooven
and
old
broderson
once
in
the
harness
room
annixter
shot
the
bolt
that
affair
outside
he
observed
will
take
care
of
itself
but
here
a
little
orphan
child
that
gets
lonesome
without
annixter
began
ladling
the
punch
filling
the
glasses
osterman
proposed
a
toast
to
quien
sabe
and
the
biggest
barn
their
elbows
crooked
in
silence
old
broderson
set
down
his
glass
wiping
his
long
beard
and
remarking
that
that
certainly
is
very
very
agreeable
i
remember
a
punch
i
drank
on
christmas
day
in
or
no
it
was
anyhow
that
punch
it
was
in
ukiah
was
he
wandered
on
aimlessly
unable
to
stop
his
flow
of
speech
losing
himself
in
details
involving
his
talk
in
a
hopeless
maze
of
trivialities
to
which
nobody
paid
any
attention
i
do
drink
myself
observed
dyke
but
just
a
taste
of
that
with
a
lot
of
water
would
be
bad
for
the
little
tad
she
think
it
was
he
was
about
to
mix
a
glass
for
sidney
but
thought
better
of
it
at
the
last
moment
it
the
chartreuse
that
lacking
commented

lowering
at
annixter
the
other
flared
up
on
the
instant
rot
rot
i
know
better
in
some
punches
it
goes
and
then
again
in
others
it
but
it
was
left
to
hooven
to
launch
the
successful
phrase
gesundheit
he
exclaimed
holding
out
his
second
glass
after
drinking
he
replaced
it
on
the
table
with
a
long
breath
ach
gott
he
cried
dat
poonsch
say
i
tink
dot
poonsch
mek
some
demn
goot
vertilizer
hey
fertiliser
the
others
roared
with
laughter
good
eye
bismarck
commented
annixter
the
name
had
a
great
success
thereafter
throughout
the
evening
the
punch
was
invariably
spoken
of
as
the
osterman
having
spilt
the
bottom
of
a
glassful
on
the
floor
pretended
that
he
saw
shoots
of
grain
coming
up
on
the
spot
suddenly
he
turned
upon
old
broderson
i
bald
ai
i
want
to
know
how
i
lost
my
hair
promise
you
wo
ask
a
single
other
question
and
i
tell
you
promise
your
word
of
eh
what
wh
i
i
do
understand
your
hair
yes
i
promise
how
did
you
lose
it
it
was
bit
the
other
gazed
at
him
stupefied
his
jaw
dropped
the
company
shouted
and
old
broderson
believing
he
had
somehow
accomplished
a
witticism
chuckled
in
his
beard
wagging
his
head
but
suddenly
he
fell
grave
struck
with
an
idea
he
demanded
yes
i
know
but
but
what
bit
it
off
ah
vociferated
osterman
that
just
what
you
promised
not
to
the
company
doubled
up
with
hilarity
caraher
leaned
against
the
door
holding
his
sides
but
hooven
all
abroad
unable
to
follow
gazed
from
face
to
face
with
a
vacant
grin
thinking
it
was
still
a
question
of
his
famous
phrase
vertilizer
hey
dots
some
fine
joke
hey
you
what
with
the
noise
of
their
talk
and
laughter
it
was
some
time
before
dyke
first
of
all
heard
a
persistent
knocking
on
the
bolted
door
he
called
annixter
attention
to
the
sound
cursing
the
intruder
annixter
unbolted
and
opened
the
door
but
at
once
his
manner
changed
hello
it
presley
come
in
come
in
there
was
a
shout
of
welcome
from
the
others
a
spirit
of
effusive
cordiality
had
begun
to
dominate
the
gathering
annixter
caught
sight
of
vanamee
back
of
presley
and
waiving
for
the
moment
the
distinction
of
employer
and
employee
insisted
that
both
the
friends
should
come
in
any
friend
of
pres
is
my
friend
he
declared
but
when
the
two
had
entered
and
had
exchanged
greetings
presley
drew
annixter
aside
vanamee
and
i
have
just
come
from
bonneville
he
explained
we
saw
delaney
there
he
got
the
buckskin
and
he
full
of
bad
whiskey
and
you
should
see
him
he
wearing
all
his
outfit
hair
trousers
sombrero
spurs
and
all
the
rest
of
it
and
he
has
strapped
himself
to
a
big
revolver
he
says
he
was
invited
to
your
barn
dance
but
that
he
coming
over
to
shoot
up
the
place
he
says
you
promised
to
show
him
off
quien
sabe
at
the
toe
of
your
boot
and
that
he
going
to
give
you
the
chance
ah
commented
annixter
nodding
his
head
he
is
is
he
presley
was
disappointed
knowing
annixter
irascibility
he
had
expected
to
produce
a
more
dramatic
effect
he
began
to
explain
the
danger
of
the
business
delaney
had
once
knifed
a
greaser
in
the
panamint
country
he
was
known
as
a
bad
man
but
annixter
refused
to
be
drawn
all
right
he
said
that
all
right
do
tell
anybody
else
you
might
scare
the
girls
off
get
in
and
outside
the
dancing
was
by
this
time
in
full
swing
the
orchestra
was
playing
a
polka
young
vacca
now
at
his
fiftieth
wax
candle
had
brought
the
floor
to
the
slippery
surface
of
glass
the
druggist
was
dancing
with
one
of
the
girls
with
the
solemnity
of
an
automaton
turning
about
and
about
always
in
the
same
direction
his
eyes
glassy
his
teeth
set
hilma
tree
was
dancing
for
the
second
time
with
harran
derrick
she
danced
with
infinite
grace
her
cheeks
were
bright
red
her
eyes
and
through
her
parted
lips
she
drew
from
time
to
time
a
long
tremulous
breath
of
pure
delight
the
music
the
weaving
colours
the
heat
of
the
air
by
now
a
little
oppressive
the
monotony
of
repeated
sensation
even
the
pain
of
physical
fatigue
had
exalted
all
her
senses
she
was
in
a
dreamy
lethargy
of
happiness
it
was
her
first
she
could
have
danced
without
stopping
until
morning
minna
hooven
and
cutter
were
hooven
with
little
hilda
already
asleep
on
her
knees
never
took
her
eyes
from
her
daughter
gown
as
often
as
minna
passed
near
her
she
vented
an
energetic
pst
pst
the
metal
tip
of
a
white
draw
string
was
showing
from
underneath
the
waist
of
minna
dress
hooven
was
on
the
point
of
tears
the
solitary
gayly
apparelled
clerk
from
bonneville
was
in
a
fever
of
agitation
he
had
lost
his
elaborate
programme
card
bewildered
beside
himself
with
trepidation
he
hurried
about
the
room
jostled
by
the
dancing
couples
tripping
over
the
feet
of
those
who
were
seated
he
peered
distressfully
under
the
chairs
and
about
the
floor
asking
anxious
questions
magnus
derrick
the
centre
of
a
listening
circle
of
ranchers
garnett
from
the
ruby
rancho
keast
from
the
ranch
of
the
same
name
gethings
and
chattern
of
the
san
pablo
and
bonanza
stood
near
the
great
open
doorway
of
the
barn
discussing
the
possibility
of
a
shortage
in
the
world
wheat
crop
for
the
next
year
abruptly
the
orchestra
ceased
playing
with
a
roll
of
the
snare
drum
a
flourish
of
the
cornet
and
a
prolonged
growl
of
the
bass
viol
the
dance
broke
up
the
couples
hurrying
to
their
seats
leaving
the
gayly
apparelled
clerk
suddenly
isolated
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
rolling
his
eyes
the
druggist
released
the
girl
with
mechanical
precision
out
amidst
the
crowd
of
dancers
he
bowed
dropping
his
chin
upon
his
cravat
throughout
the
dance
neither
had
hazarded
a
word
the
girl
found
her
way
alone
to
a
chair
but
the
druggist
sick
from
continually
revolving
in
the
same
direction
walked
unsteadily
toward
the
wall
all
at
once
the
barn
reeled
around
him
he
fell
down
there
was
a
great
laugh
but
he
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
disappeared
abruptly
out
into
the
night
through
the
doorway
of
the
barn
deathly
pale
his
hand
upon
his
stomach
dabney
the
old
man
whom
nobody
knew
approached
the
group
of
ranchers
around
magnus
derrick
and
stood
a
little
removed
listening
gravely
to
what
the
governor
was
saying
his
chin
sunk
in
his
collar
silent
offering
no
opinions
but
the
leader
of
the
orchestra
with
a
great
gesture
of
his
violin
bow
cried
out
all
take
partners
for
the
lancers
and
promenade
around
the
hall
however
there
was
a
delay
a
little
crowd
formed
around
the
platform
voices
were
raised
there
was
a
commotion
skeezicks
who
played
the
big
horn
accused
the
cornet
and
the
of
stealing
his
cold
lunch
at
intervals
he
could
be
heard
expostulating
ah
no
at
the
end
of
the
end
render
me
the
sausages
you
or
less
i
break
your
throat
aha
i
know

are
going
to
play
me
there
a
bad
farce

sausages
and
the
pork
sandwich
else
i
go
away
from
this
place
he
made
an
exaggerated
show
of
replacing
his
big
horn
in
its
case
but
the
raised
a
great
protest
the
sandwiches
and
one
sausage
were
produced
the
other
had
disappeared
in
the
end
skeezichs
allowed
himself
to
be
appeased
the
dance
was
resumed
half
an
hour
later
the
gathering
in
the
harness
room
was
considerably
reinforced
it
was
the
corner
of
the
barn
toward
which
the
male
guests
naturally
gravitated
harran
derrick
who
only
cared
to
dance
with
hilma
tree
was
admitted
garnett
from
the
ruby
rancho
and
gethings
from
the
san
pablo
came
in
a
little
afterwards
a
fourth
bowl
of
punch
was
mixed
annixter
and
caraher
clamouring
into
each
other
face
as
to
its
ingredients
cigars
were
lighted
soon
the
air
of
the
room
became
blue
with
an
acrid
haze
of
smoke
it
was
very
warm
ranged
in
their
chairs
around
the
side
of
the
room
the
guests
emptied
glass
after
glass
vanamee
alone
refused
to
drink
he
sat
a
little
to
one
side
disassociating
himself
from
what
was
going
forward
watching
the
others
calmly
a
little
contemptuously
a
cigarette
in
his
fingers
hooven
after
drinking
his
third
glass
however
was
afflicted
with
a
great
sadness
his
breast
heaved
with
immense
sighs
he
asserted
that
he
was
obbressed
cutter
had
taken
his
steer
he
retired
to
a
corner
and
seated
himself
in
a
heap
on
his
chair
his
heels
on
the
rungs
wiping
the
tears
from
his
eyes
refusing
to
be
comforted
old
broderson
startled
annixter
who
sat
next
to
him
out
of
all
measure
by
suddenly
winking
at
him
with
infinite
craftiness
when
i
was
a
lad
in
ukiah
he
whispered
hoarsely
i
was
a
devil
of
a
fellow
with
the
girls
but
lordy
he
nudged
him
slyly
i
would
have
it
known
of
those
who
were
drinking
annixter
alone
retained
all
his
wits
though
keeping
pace
with
the
others
glass
for
glass
the
punch
left
him
solid
upon
his
feet
the
tough
fibre
of
him
seemed
proof
against
alcohol
never
in
his
life
had
he
been
drunk
he
prided
himself
upon
his
power
of
resistance
it
was
his
nature
say
exclaimed
old
broderson
gravely
addressing
the
company
pulling
at
his
beard
uneasily
say
i
i
listen
i
a
devil
of
a
fellow
with
the
he
wagged
his
head
doggedly
shutting
his
eyes
in
a
knowing
fashion
yes
sir
i
am
there
was
a
young
lady
in
ukiah
that
was
when
i
was
a
lad
of
seventeen
we
used
to
meet
in
the
cemetery
in
the
afternoons
i
was
to
go
away
to
school
at
sacramento
and
the
afternoon
i
left
we
met
in
the
cemetery
and
we
stayed
so
long
i
almost
missed
the
train
her
name
was
there
was
a
pause
the
others
waited
for
the
rest
of
the
story
and
afterwards
prompted
annixter
afterwards
nothing
afterwards
i
never
saw
her
again
her
name
was
the
company
raised
a
chorus
of
derision
and
osterman
cried
ironically
say
that
a
pretty
good
one
tell
us
the
old
man
laughed
with
the
rest
believing
he
had
made
another
hit
he
called
osterman
to
him
whispering
in
his
ear
sh
look
here
some
night

annixter
gave
over
the
making
of
the
fifth
bowl
of
punch
to
osterman
who
affirmed
that
he
had
a
recipe
for
a
fertiliser
from
solotari
that
would
take
the
plating
off
the
ladle
he
left
him
wrangling
with
caraher
who
still
persisted
in
adding
chartreuse
and
stepped
out
into
the
dance
to
see
how
things
were
getting
on
it
was
the
interval
between
two
dances
in
and
around
a
stall
at
the
farther
end
of
the
floor
where
lemonade
was
being
served
was
a
great
throng
of
young
men
others
hurried
across
the
floor
singly
or
by
twos
and
threes
gingerly
carrying
overflowing
glasses
to
their
partners
sitting
in
long
rows
of
white
and
blue
and
pink
against
the
opposite
wall
their
mothers
and
older
sisters
in
a
second
rank
behind
them
a
babel
of
talk
was
in
the
air
mingled
with
gusts
of
laughter
everybody
seemed
having
a
good
time
in
the
increasing
heat
the
decorations
of
evergreen
trees
and
festoons
threw
off
a
pungent
aroma
that
suggested
a
christmas
festival
in
the
other
stalls
lower
down
the
barn
the
young
men
had
brought
chairs
and
in
these
deep
recesses
the
most
desperate
was
in
progress
the
young
man
his
hair
neatly
parted
leaning
with
great
solicitation
over
the
girl
his
partner
for
the
moment
fanning
her
conscientiously
his
arm
carefully
laid
along
the
back
of
her
chair
by
the
doorway
annixter
met
sarria
who
had
stepped
out
to
smoke
a
fat
black
cigar
the
set
smile
of
amiability
was
still
fixed
on
the
smooth
shiny
face
the
cigar
ashes
had
left
grey
streaks
on
the
front
of
his
cassock
he
avoided
annixter
fearing
no
doubt
an
allusion
to
his
game
cocks
and
took
up
his
position
back
of
the
second
rank
of
chairs
by
the
musicians
stand
beaming
encouragingly
upon
every
one
who
caught
his
eye
annixter
was
saluted
right
and
left
as
he
slowly
went
the
round
of
the
floor
at
every
moment
he
had
to
pause
to
shake
hands
and
to
listen
to
congratulations
upon
the
size
of
his
barn
and
the
success
of
his
dance
but
he
was
distrait
his
thoughts
elsewhere
he
did
not
attempt
to
hide
his
impatience
when
some
of
the
young
men
tried
to
engage
him
in
conversation
asking
him
to
be
introduced
to
their
sisters
or
their
friends
sisters
he
sent
them
about
their
business
harshly
abominably
rude
leaving
a
wake
of
angry
disturbance
behind
him
sowing
the
seeds
of
future
quarrels
and
renewed
unpopularity
he
was
looking
for
hilma
tree
when
at
last
he
came
unexpectedly
upon
her
standing
near
where
tree
was
seated
some
young
men
hovering
uneasily
in
her
neighbourhood
all
his
audacity
was
suddenly
stricken
from
him
his
gruffness
his
overbearing
insolence
vanished
with
an
abruptness
that
left
him
cold
his
confusion
and
embarrassment
returned
to
him
instead
of
speaking
to
her
as
he
intended
he
affected
not
to
see
her
but
passed
by
his
head
in
the
air
pretending
a
sudden
interest
in
a
japanese
lantern
that
was
about
to
catch
fire
but
he
had
had
a
single
distinct
glimpse
of
her
definite
precise
and
this
glimpse
was
enough
hilma
had
changed
the
change
was
subtle
evanescent
hard
to
define
but
not
the
less
unmistakable
the
excitement
the
enchanting
delight
the
delicious
disturbance
of
the
first
ball
had
produced
its
result
perhaps
there
had
only
been
this
lacking
it
was
hard
to
say
but
for
that
brief
instant
of
time
annixter
was
looking
at
hilma
the
woman
she
was
no
longer
the
young
girl
upon
whom
he
might
look
down
to
whom
he
might
condescend
whose
little
infantile
graces
were
to
be
considered
with
amused
toleration
when
annixter
returned
to
the
harness
room
he
let
himself
into
a
clamour
of
masculine
hilarity
osterman
had
indeed
made
a
marvellous
fertiliser
whiskey
for
the
most
part
diluted
with
champagne
and
lemon
juice
the
first
round
of
this
drink
had
been
welcomed
with
a
salvo
of
cheers
hooven
recovering
his
spirits
under
its
violent
stimulation
spoke
of
heving
ut
oudt
mit
cudder
bei
gott
while
osterman
standing
on
a
chair
at
the
end
of
the
room
shouted
for
a
few
moments
quiet
gentlemen
so
that
he
might
tell
a
certain
story
he
knew
but
abruptly
annixter
discovered
that
the
liquors
the
champagne
whiskey
brandy
and
the
like
were
running
low
this
would
never
do
he
felt
that
he
would
stand
disgraced
if
it
could
be
said
afterward
that
he
had
not
provided
sufficient
drink
at
his
entertainment
he
slipped
out
unobserved
and
finding
two
of
his
ranch
hands
near
the
doorway
sent
them
down
to
the
ranch
house
to
bring
up
all
the
cases
of
stuff
they
found
there
however
when
this
matter
had
been
attended
to
annixter
did
not
immediately
return
to
the
harness
room
on
the
floor
of
the
barn
a
square
dance
was
under
way
the
leader
of
the
city
band
calling
the
figures
young
vacca
indefatigably
continued
the
rounds
of
the
barn
paring
candle
after
candle
possessed
with
this
single
idea
of
duty
pushing
the
dancers
out
of
his
way
refusing
to
admit
that
the
floor
was
yet
sufficiently
slippery
the
druggist
had
returned
indoors
and
leaned
dejected
and
melancholy
against
the
wall
near
the
doorway
unable
to
dance
his
evening
enjoyment
spoiled
the
gayly
apparelled
clerk
from
bonneville
had
just
involved
himself
in
a
deplorable
incident
in
a
search
for
his
handkerchief
which
he
had
lost
while
trying
to
find
his
programme
card
he
had
inadvertently
wandered
into
the
feed
room
set
apart
as
the
ladies
dressing
room
at
the
moment
when
hooven
having
removed
the
waist
of
minna
dress
was
relacing
her
corsets
there
was
a
tremendous
scene
the
clerk
was
ejected
forcibly
hooven
filling
all
the
neighbourhood
with
shrill
expostulation
a
young
man
minna
partner
who
stood
near
the
feed
room
door
waiting
for
her
to
come
out
had
invited
the
clerk
with
elaborate
sarcasm
to
step
outside
for
a
moment
and
the
clerk
breathless
stupefied
hustled
from
hand
to
hand
remained
petrified
with
staring
eyes
turning
about
and
about
looking
wildly
from
face
to
face
speechless
witless
wondering
what
had
happened
but
the
square
dance
was
over
the
city
band
was
just
beginning
to
play
a
waltz
annixter
assuring
himself
that
everything
was
going
all
right
was
picking
his
way
across
the
floor
when
he
came
upon
hilma
tree
quite
alone
and
looking
anxiously
among
the
crowd
of
dancers
having
a
good
time
miss
hilma
he
demanded
pausing
for
a
moment
oh
am
i
just
she
exclaimed
the
best
time
but
i
do
know
what
has
become
of
my
partner
see
i
left
all
alone
the
only
time
this
whole
evening
she
added
proudly
have
you
seen
him
my
partner
sir
i
forget
his
name
i
only
met
him
this
evening
and
i
met
so
many
i
ca
begin
to
remember
half
of
them
he
was
a
young
man
from
bonneville
a
clerk
i
think
because
i
remember
seeing
him
in
a
store
there
and
he
wore
the
prettiest
clothes
i
guess
he
got
lost
in
the
shuffle
observed
annixter
suddenly
an
idea
occurred
to
him
he
took
his
resolution
in
both
hands
he
clenched
his
teeth
say
look
here
miss
hilma
what
the
matter
with
you
and
i
stealing
this
one
for
ourselves
i
do
mean
to
dance
i
do
propose
to
make
a
of
myself
for
some
galoot
to
give
me
the
laugh
but
walk
around
will
you
what
do
you
say
hilma
consented
i
not
so
very
sorry
i
missed
my
dance
with
that
that
little
clerk
she
said
guiltily
i
suppose
that
very
bad
of
me
is
it
annixter
fulminated
a
vigorous
protest
i
am
so
warm
murmured
hilma
fanning
herself
with
her
handkerchief
and
oh
such
a
good
time
as
i
have
had
i
was
so
afraid
that
i
would
be
a
and
sit
up
by
mamma
and
papa
the
whole
evening
and
as
it
is
i
have
had
every
single
dance
and
even
some
dances
i
had
to
split
she
breathed
glancing
lovingly
around
the
barn
noting
again
the
festoons
of
cambric
the
japanese
lanterns
flaring
lamps
and
decorations
of
evergreen
it
all
so
lovely
just
like
a
fairy
story
and
to
think
that
it
ca
last
but
for
one
little
evening
and
that
morning
one
must
wake
up
to
the
things
again
well
observed
annixter
doggedly
unwilling
that
she
should
forget
whom
she
ought
to
thank
i
did
my
best
and
my
best
is
as
good
as
another
man
i
hilma
overwhelmed
him
with
a
burst
of
gratitude
which
he
gruffly
pretended
to
deprecate
oh
that
was
all
right
it
had
cost
him
much
he
liked
to
see
people
having
a
good
time
himself
and
the
crowd
did
seem
to
be
enjoying
themselves
what
did
she
think
did
things
look
lively
enough
and
how
about
herself
was
she
enjoying
it
stupidly
annixter
drove
the
question
home
again
at
his
wits
end
as
to
how
to
make
conversation
hilma
protested
volubly
she
would
never
forget
this
night
adding
dance
oh
you
do
know
how
i
love
it
i
did
know
myself
i
could
dance
all
night
and
never
stop
once
annixter
was
smitten
with
uneasiness
no
doubt
this
promenading
was
not
at
all
to
her
taste
wondering
what
kind
of
a
spectacle
he
was
about
to
make
of
himself
he
exclaimed
want
to
dance
now
oh
yes
she
returned
they
paused
in
their
walk
and
hilma
facing
him
gave
herself
into
his
arms
annixter
shut
his
teeth
the
perspiration
starting
from
his
forehead
for
five
years
he
had
abandoned
dancing
never
in
his
best
days
had
it
been
one
of
his
accomplishments
they
hesitated
a
moment
waiting
to
catch
the
time
from
the
musicians
another
couple
bore
down
upon
them
at
precisely
the
wrong
moment
jostling
them
out
of
step
annixter
swore
under
his
breath
his
arm
still
about
the
young
woman
he
pulled
her
over
to
one
corner
now
he
muttered
we
try
a
second
time
listening
to
the
cadence
of
the
musicians
they
endeavoured
to
get
under
way
annixter
waited
the
fraction
of
a
second
too
long
and
stepped
on
hilma
foot
on
the
third
attempt
having
worked
out
of
the
corner
a
pair
of
dancers
bumped
into
them
once
more
and
as
they
were
recovering
themselves
another
couple
caromed
violently
against
annixter
so
that
he
all
but
lost
his
footing
he
was
in
a
rage
hilma
very
embarrassed
was
trying
not
to
laugh
and
thus
they
found
themselves
out
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
continually
jostled
from
their
position
holding
clumsily
to
each
other
stammering
excuses
into
one
another
faces
when
delaney
arrived
he
came
with
the
suddenness
of
an
explosion
there
was
a
commotion
by
the
doorway
a
rolling
burst
of
oaths
a
furious
stamping
of
hoofs
a
wild
scramble
of
the
dancers
to
either
side
of
the
room
and
there
he
was
he
had
ridden
the
buckskin
at
a
gallop
straight
through
the
doorway
and
out
into
the
middle
of
the
floor
of
the
barn
once
well
inside
delaney
hauled
up
on
the
cruel
at
the
same
time
driving
home
the
spurs
and
the
buckskin
without
halting
in
her
gait
rose
into
the
air
upon
her
hind
feet
and
coming
down
again
with
a
thunder
of
iron
hoofs
upon
the
hollow
floor
lashed
out
with
both
heels
simultaneously
her
back
arched
her
head
between
her
knees
it
was
the
running
buck
and
had
not
delaney
been
the
hardest
buster
in
the
county
would
have
flung
him
headlong
like
a
sack
of
sand
but
he
eased
off
the
bit
gripping
the
mare
flanks
with
his
knees
and
the
buckskin
having
long
since
known
her
master
came
to
hand
quivering
the
bloody
spume
dripping
from
the
bit
upon
the
slippery
floor
delaney
had
arrayed
himself
with
painful
elaboration
determined
to
look
the
part
bent
upon
creating
the
impression
resolved
that
his
appearance
at
least
should
justify
his
reputation
of
being
nothing
was
lacking
neither
the
campaign
hat
with
upturned
brim
nor
the
dotted
blue
handkerchief
knotted
behind
the
neck
nor
the
heavy
gauntlets
stitched
with
red
nor
this
above
all
the
chaparejos
the
hair
trousers
of
the
mountain
cowboy
the
pistol
holster
low
on
the
thigh
but
for
the
moment
this
holster
was
empty
and
in
his
right
hand
the
hammer
at
full
cock
the
chamber
loaded
the
puncher
flourished
his
teaser
an
army
colt
the
lamplight
dully
reflected
in
the
dark
blue
steel
in
a
second
of
time
the
dance
was
a
bedlam
the
musicians
stopped
with
a
discord
and
the
middle
of
the
crowded
floor
bared
itself
instantly
it
was
like
sand
blown
from
off
a
rock
the
throng
of
guests
carried
by
an
impulse
that
was
not
to
be
resisted
bore
back
against
the
sides
of
the
barn
overturning
chairs
tripping
upon
each
other
falling
down
scrambling
to
their
feet
again
stepping
over
one
another
getting
behind
each
other
diving
under
chairs
flattening
themselves
against
the
wall
a
wild
clamouring
blind
deaf
a
confused
tangle
of
waving
arms
torn
muslin
crushed
flowers
pale
faces
tangled
legs
that
swept
in
all
directions
back
from
the
centre
of
the
floor
leaving
annixter
and
hilma
alone
deserted
their
arms
about
each
other
face
to
face
with
delaney
mad
with
alcohol
bursting
with
remembered
insult
bent
on
evil
reckless
of
results
after
the
first
scramble
for
safety
the
crowd
fell
quiet
for
the
fraction
of
an
instant
glued
to
the
walls
afraid
to
stir
struck
dumb
and
motionless
with
surprise
and
terror
and
in
the
instant
silence
that
followed
annixter
his
eyes
on
delaney
muttered
rapidly
to
hilma
get
back
get
away
to
one
side
the
fool
might
there
was
a
second
respite
afforded
while
delaney
occupied
himself
in
quieting
the
buckskin
and
in
that
second
of
time
at
this
moment
of
crisis
the
wonderful
thing
occurred
hilma
turning
from
delaney
her
hands
clasped
on
annixter
arm
her
eyes
meeting
his
exclaimed
you
too
and
that
was
all
but
to
annixter
it
was
a
revelation
never
more
alive
to
his
surroundings
never
more
observant
he
suddenly
understood
for
the
briefest
lapse
of
time
he
and
hilma
looked
deep
into
each
eyes
and
from
that
moment
on
annixter
knew
that
hilma
cared
the
whole
matter
was
brief
as
the
snapping
of
a
finger
two
words
and
a
glance
and
all
was
done
but
as
though
nothing
had
occurred
annixter
pushed
hilma
from
him
repeating
harshly
get
back
i
tell
you
do
you
see
he
got
a
gun
have
i
enough
on
my
hands
without
you
he
loosed
her
clasp
and
his
eyes
once
more
on
delaney
moved
diagonally
backwards
toward
the
side
of
the
barn
pushing
hilma
from
him
in
the
end
he
thrust
her
away
so
sharply
that
she
gave
back
with
a
long
stagger
somebody
caught
her
arm
and
drew
her
in
leaving
annixter
alone
once
more
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
his
hands
in
his
coat
pockets
watchful
alert
facing
his
enemy
but
the
was
not
ready
to
come
to
grapples
yet
fearless
his
wits
gambolling
under
the
lash
of
the
alcohol
he
wished
to
make
the
most
of
the
occasion
maintaining
the
suspense
playing
for
the
gallery
by
touches
of
the
hand
and
knee
he
kept
the
buckskin
in
continual
nervous
movement
her
hoofs
clattering
snorting
tossing
her
head
while
he
himself
addressing
himself
to
annixter
poured
out
a
torrent
of
invective
well
strike
me
blind
if
it
ai
old
buck
annixter
he
was
going
to
show
me
off
quien
sabe
at
the
toe
of
his
boot

he
well
your
chance
with
the
ladies
to
see
you
do
it
gives
a
dance

he
in
his
barn
and
forgets
to
invite
his
old
friend
but
his
friend

forget
him

remembers
little
things

the
he
fanned
his
revolver
spinning
it
about
his
index
finger
by
the
with
incredible
swiftness
the
twirling
weapon
a
mere
blur
of
blue
steel
in
his
hand
suddenly
and
without
any
apparent
cessation
of
the
movement
he
fired
and
a
little
splinter
of
wood
flipped
into
the
air
at
annixter
feet
time
he
shouted
while
the
buckskin
reared
to
the
report
hold
on
wait
a
minute
this
place
is
too
light
to
suit
that
big
light
yonder
is
in
my
eyes
look
out
i
going
to
throw
a
second
shot
put
out
the
lamp
over
the
musicians
stand
the
assembled
guests
shrieked
a
frantic
shrinking
quiver
ran
through
the
crowd
like
the
huddling
of
frightened
rabbits
in
their
pen
annixter
hardly
moved
he
stood
some
thirty
paces
from
the
buster
his
hands
still
in
his
coat
pockets
his
eyes
glistening
watchful
excitable
and
turbulent
in
trifling
matters
when
actual
bodily
danger
threatened
he
was
of
an
abnormal
quiet
i
watching
you
cried
the
other
do
make
any
mistake
about
that
keep
your
hands
in
your
coat
pockets
if
you
like
to
live
a
little
longer
understand
and
do
let
me
see
you
make
a
move
toward
your
hip
or
your
friends
will
be
asked
to
identify
you
at
the
morgue
morning
when
i
bad
i
called
the
undertaker
friend
so
i
am
and
i
that
bad
that
i
scared
of
myself
they
have
to
revise
the
census
returns
before
i
done
with
this
place
come
on
now
getting
tired
waiting
i
come
to
see
a
hand
over
that
horse
delaney
said
annixter
without
raising
his
voice
and
clear
the
other
affected
to
be
overwhelmed
with
infinite
astonishment
his
eyes
staring
he
peered
down
from
the
saddle
he
exclaimed
did
you
say
why
i
guess
you
must
be
looking
for
trouble
that
what
i
there
where
you
wrong
muttered
annixter
partly
to
delaney
partly
to
himself
if
i
was
looking
for
trouble
there
be
any
about
with
the
words
he
began
firing
delaney
had
hardly
entered
the
barn
before
annixter
plan
had
been
formed
long
since
his
revolver
was
in
the
pocket
of
his
coat
and
he
fired
now
through
the
coat
itself
without
withdrawing
his
hands
until
that
moment
annixter
had
not
been
sure
of
himself
there
was
no
doubt
that
for
the
first
few
moments
of
the
affair
he
would
have
welcomed
with
joy
any
reasonable
excuse
for
getting
out
of
the
situation
but
the
sound
of
his
own
revolver
gave
him
confidence
he
whipped
it
from
his
pocket
and
fired
again
abruptly
the
duel
began
report
following
report
spurts
of
pale
blue
smoke
jetting
like
the
darts
of
short
spears
between
the
two
men
expanding
to
a
haze
and
drifting
overhead
in
wavering
strata
it
was
quite
probable
that
no
thought
of
killing
each
other
suggested
itself
to
either
annixter
or
delaney
both
fired
without
aiming
very
deliberately
to
empty
their
revolvers
and
avoid
being
hit
was
the
desire
common
to
both
they
no
longer
vituperated
each
other
the
revolvers
spoke
for
them
long
after
annixter
could
recall
this
moment
for
years
he
could
with
but
little
effort
reconstruct
the
scene
the
densely
packed
crowd
flattened
against
the
sides
of
the
barn
the
festoons
of
lanterns
the
mingled
smell
of
evergreens
new
wood
sachets
and
powder
smoke
the
vague
clamour
of
distress
and
terror
that
rose
from
the
throng
of
guests
the
squealing
of
the
buckskin
the
uneven
explosions
of
the
revolvers
the
reverberation
of
trampling
hoofs
a
brief
glimpse
of
harran
derrick
excited
face
at
the
door
of
the
harness
room
and
in
the
open
space
in
the
centre
of
the
floor
himself
and
delaney
manoeuvring
swiftly
in
a
cloud
of
smoke
annixter
revolver
contained
but
six
cartridges
already
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
had
fired
twenty
times
without
doubt
the
next
shot
was
his
last
then
what
he
peered
through
the
blue
haze
that
with
every
discharge
thickened
between
him
and
the
buster
for
his
own
safety
he
must
place
at
least
one
shot
delaney
chest
and
shoulders
rose
suddenly
above
the
smoke
close
upon
him
as
the
distraught
buckskin
reared
again
annixter
for
the
first
time
during
the
fight
took
definite
aim
but
before
he
could
draw
the
trigger
there
was
a
great
shout
and
he
was
aware
of
the
buckskin
the
bridle
trailing
the
saddle
empty
plunging
headlong
across
the
floor
crashing
into
the
line
of
chairs
delaney
was
scrambling
off
the
floor
there
was
blood
on
the
buster
wrist
and
he
no
longer
carried
his
revolver
suddenly
he
turned
and
ran
the
crowd
parted
right
and
left
before
him
as
he
made
toward
the
doorway
he
disappeared
twenty
men
promptly
sprang
to
the
buckskin
head
but
she
broke
away
and
wild
with
terror
bewildered
blind
insensate
charged
into
the
corner
of
the
barn
by
the
musicians
stand
she
brought
up
against
the
wall
with
cruel
force
and
with
impact
of
a
sack
of
stones
her
head
was
cut
she
turned
and
charged
again
the
blood
streaming
from
her
forehead
the
crowd
shrieking
melted
before
her
rush
an
old
man
was
thrown
down
and
trampled
the
buckskin
trod
upon
the
dragging
bridle
somersaulted
into
a
confusion
of
chairs
in
one
corner
and
came
down
with
a
terrific
clatter
in
a
wild
disorder
of
kicking
hoofs
and
splintered
wood
but
a
crowd
of
men
fell
upon
her
tugging
at
the
bit
sitting
on
her
head
shouting
gesticulating
for
five
minutes
she
struggled
and
fought
then
by
degrees
she
recovered
herself
drawing
great
sobbing
breaths
at
long
intervals
that
all
but
burst
the
girths
rolling
her
eyes
in
bewildered
supplicating
fashion
trembling
in
every
muscle
and
starting
and
shrinking
now
and
then
like
a
young
girl
in
hysterics
at
last
she
lay
quiet
the
men
allowed
her
to
struggle
to
her
feet
the
saddle
was
removed
and
she
was
led
to
one
of
the
empty
stalls
where
she
remained
the
rest
of
the
evening
her
head
low
her
pasterns
quivering
turning
her
head
apprehensively
from
time
to
time
showing
the
white
of
one
eye
and
at
long
intervals
heaving
a
single
prolonged
sigh
and
an
hour
later
the
dance
was
progressing
as
evenly
as
though
nothing
in
the
least
extraordinary
had
occurred
the
incident
was
closed
that
abrupt
swoop
of
terror
and
impending
death
dropping
down
there
from
out
the
darkness
cutting
abruptly
athwart
the
gayety
of
the
moment
come
and
gone
with
the
swiftness
of
a
thunderclap
many
of
the
women
had
gone
home
taking
their
men
with
them
but
the
great
bulk
of
the
crowd
still
remained
seeing
no
reason
why
the
episode
should
interfere
with
the
evening
enjoyment
resolved
to
hold
the
ground
for
mere
bravado
if
for
nothing
else
delaney
would
not
come
back
of
that
everybody
was
persuaded
and
in
case
he
should
there
was
not
found
wanting
fully
half
a
hundred
young
men
who
would
give
him
a
dressing
down
by
jingo
they
had
been
too
surprised
to
act
when
delaney
had
first
appeared
and
before
they
knew
where
they
were
at
the
buster
had
cleared
out
in
another
minute
just
another
second
they
would
have
shown
him
yes
sir
by
jingo
ah
you
bet
on
all
sides
the
reminiscences
began
to
circulate
at
least
one
man
in
every
three
had
been
involved
in
a
gun
fight
at
some
time
of
his
life
ah

to
have
seen

time

so
on
over

over
again

asserted

when
three
men
were
shot
falling
in
a
fusillade
of

and
expiring

looked
on

been
in
a
stage
when
the
shotgun
messenger
was
murdered
stories
by
the
hundreds
went
the
round
of
the
company
the
air
was
surcharged
with
blood
dying
groans
the
reek
of
powder
smoke
the
crack
of
rifles
all
the
legends
of
the
violent
wild
life
of
the
early
days
were
recalled
to
view
defiling
before
them
there
in
an
endless
procession
under
the
glare
of
paper
lanterns
and
kerosene
lamps
but
the
affair
had
aroused
a
combative
spirit
amongst
the
men
of
the
assembly
instantly
a
spirit
of
aggression
of
truculence
swelled
up
underneath
waistcoats
and
starched
shirt
bosoms
more
than
one
offender
was
promptly
asked
to
step
it
was
like
young
bucks
excited
by
an
encounter
of
stags
lowering
their
horns
upon
the
slightest
provocation
showing
off
before
the
does
and
fawns
old
quarrels
were
remembered
one
sought
laboriously
for
slights
and
insults
veiled
in
ordinary
conversation
the
sense
of
personal
honour
became
refined
to
a
delicate
fine
point
upon
the
slightest
pretext
there
was
a
haughty
drawing
up
of
the
figure
a
twisting
of
the
lips
into
a
smile
of
scorn
caraher
spoke
of
shooting
behrman
on
sight
before
the
end
of
the
week
twice
it
became
necessary
to
separate
hooven
and
cutter
renewing
their
quarrel
as
to
the
ownership
of
the
steer
all
at
once
minna
hooven
partner
fell
upon
the
gayly
apparelled
clerk
from
bonneville
pummelling
him
with
his
fists
hustling
him
out
of
the
hall
vociferating
that
miss
hooven
had
been
grossly
insulted
it
took
three
men
to
extricate
the
clerk
from
his
clutches
dazed
gasping
his
collar
unfastened
and
sticking
up
into
his
face
his
eyes
staring
wildly
into
the
faces
of
the
crowd
but
annixter
bursting
with
pride
his
chest
thrown
out
his
chin
in
the
air
reigned
enthroned
in
a
circle
of
adulation
he
was
the
hero
to
shake
him
by
the
hand
was
an
honour
to
be
struggled
for
one
clapped
him
on
the
back
with
solemn
nods
of
approval
there
the
boy
for
you
there
was
nerve
for
you
what
the
matter
with
annixter
how
about
that
for
sand
and
how
was
that
for
a
shot
why
apache
kid
have
bettered
cool
took
a
steady
eye
and
a
sure
hand
to
make
a
shot
like
there
was
a
shot
that
would
be
told
about
in
tulare
county
fifty
years
to
annixter
had
refrained
from
replying
all
ears
to
this
conversation
wondering
just
what
had
happened
he
knew
only
that
delaney
had
run
leaving
his
revolver
and
a
spatter
of
blood
behind
him
by
degrees
however
he
ascertained
that
his
last
shot
but
one
had
struck
pistol
hand
shattering
it
and
knocking
the
revolver
from
his
grip
he
was
overwhelmed
with
astonishment
why
after
the
shooting
began
he
had
not
so
much
as
seen
delaney
with
any
degree
of
plainness
the
whole
affair
was
a
whirl
well
where
did
you
learn
to
shoot
that
way
some
one
in
the
crowd
demanded
annixter
moved
his
shoulders
with
a
gesture
of
vast
unconcern
oh
he
observed
carelessly
it
not
my
shooting
that
ever
worried
me
the
crowd
gaped
with
delight
there
was
a
great
wagging
of
heads
well
i
guess
no
sir
not
ah
no
you
bet
when
the
women
pressed
around
him
shaking
his
hands
declaring
that
he
had
saved
their
daughters
lives
annixter
assumed
a
pose
of
superb
deprecation
the
modest
of
the
chevalier
he
delivered
himself
of
a
remembered
phrase
very
elegant
refined
it
was
lancelot
after
the
tournament
bayard
receiving
felicitations
after
the
battle
oh
do
say
anything
about
it
he
murmured
i
only
did
what
any
man
would
have
done
in
my
to
restore
completely
the
equanimity
of
the
company
he
announced
supper
this
he
had
calculated
as
a
tremendous
surprise
it
was
to
have
been
served
at
but
the
irruption
of
delaney
had
dislocated
the
order
of
events
and
the
tables
were
brought
in
an
hour
ahead
of
time
they
were
arranged
around
three
sides
of
the
barn
and
were
loaded
down
with
cold
roasts
of
beef
cold
chickens
and
cold
ducks
mountains
of
sandwiches
pitchers
of
milk
and
lemonade
entire
cheeses
bowls
of
olives
plates
of
oranges
and
nuts
the
advent
of
this
supper
was
received
with
a
volley
of
applause
the
musicians
played
a
quick
step
the
company
threw
themselves
upon
the
food
with
a
great
scraping
of
chairs
and
a
vast
rustle
of
muslins
tarletans
and
organdies
soon
the
clatter
of
dishes
was
a
veritable
uproar
the
tables
were
taken
by
assault
one
ate
whatever
was
nearest
at
hand
some
even
beginning
with
oranges
and
nuts
and
ending
with
beef
and
chicken
at
the
end
the
paper
caps
were
brought
on
together
with
the
ice
cream
all
up
and
down
the
tables
the
pulled
crackers
snapped
continually
like
the
discharge
of
innumerable
tiny
rifles
the
caps
of
tissue
paper
were
put
on
phrygian
bonnets

the
young
girls
looked
across
the
table
at
their
with
bursts
of
laughter
and
vigorous
clapping
of
the
hands
the
harness

crowd
had
a
table
to
themselves
at
the
head
of
which
sat

and
at
the
foot

gun
fight
had
sobered
presley
thoroughly
he
sat
by
the
side
of
vanamee
who
ate
but
little
preferring
rather
to
watch
the
scene
with
calm
observation
a
little
contemptuous
when
the
uproar
around
the
table
was
too
boisterous
savouring
of
intoxication
osterman
rolled
bullets
of
bread
and
shot
them
with
astonishing
force
up
and
down

in
his
huge
reptilian
slit
of
a
mouth
his
cheeks
of
brownish
red
were
extended
his
bald
forehead
glistened
colics
seized
upon
him

i
got
the
toad
at
home
now
in
a
bottle
of
and
the
old
man
never
doubting
his
eyes
starting
wagged
his
head
in
amazement
oh
yes
cried
caraher
the
length
of
the
table
that
a
pretty
good
one
tell
us
that
reminds
me
of
a
story
hazarded
old
broderson
uncertainly
once
when
i
was
a
lad
in
ukiah
fifty
oh
yes
cried
half
a
dozen
voices
that
a
pretty
good
one
tell
us
eh
wh
what
murmured
broderson
looking
about
him
i
i
do
know
it
was
ukiah
you
you
you
mix
me
all
as
soon
as
supper
was
over
the
floor
was
cleared
again
the
guests
clamoured
for
a
virginia
reel
the
last
quarter
of
the
evening
the
time
of
the
most
riotous
fun
was
beginning
the
young
men
caught
the
girls
who
sat
next
to
them
the
orchestra
dashed
off
into
a
rollicking
movement
the
two
lines
were
formed
in
a
second
of
time
the
dance
was
under
way
again
the
guests
still
wearing
the
phrygian
bonnets
and
liberty
caps
of
pink
and
blue
tissue
paper
but
the
group
of
men
once
more
adjourned
to
the
harness
room
fresh
boxes
of
cigars
were
opened
the
seventh
bowl
of
fertiliser
was
mixed
osterman
poured
the
dregs
of
a
glass
of
it
upon
his
bald
head
declaring
that
he
could
feel
the
hair
beginning
to
grow
but
suddenly
old
broderson
rose
to
his
feet
aha
he
cackled
i
going
to
have
a
dance
i
am
think
i
too
old
i
show
you
young
fellows
i
a
regular
old
rooster
when
i
get
he
marched
out
into
the
barn
the
others
following
holding
their
sides
he
found
an
aged
mexican
woman
by
the
door
and
hustled
her
all
confused
and
giggling
into
the
virginia
reel
then
at
its
height
every
one
crowded
around
to
see
old
broderson
stepped
off
with
the
alacrity
of
a
colt
snapping
his
fingers
slapping
his
thigh
his
mouth
widening
in
an
excited
grin
the
entire
company
of
the
guests
shouted
the
city
band
redoubled
their
efforts
and
the
old
man
losing
his
head
breathless
gasping
dislocated
his
stiff
joints
in
his
efforts
he
became
possessed
bowing
scraping
advancing
retreating
wagging
his
beard
cutting
pigeons
wings
distraught
with
the
music
the
clamour
the
applause
the
effects
of
the
fertiliser
annixter
shouted
nice
eye
santa
but
annixter
attention
wandered
he
searched
for
hilma
tree
having
still
in
mind
the
look
in
her
eyes
at
that
swift
moment
of
danger
he
had
not
seen
her
since
then
at
last
he
caught
sight
of
her
she
was
not
dancing
but
instead
was
sitting
with
her
partner
at
the
end
of
the
barn
near
her
father
and
mother
her
eyes
wide
a
serious
expression
on
her
face
her
thoughts
no
doubt
elsewhere
annixter
was
about
to
go
to
her
when
he
was
interrupted
by
a
cry
old
broderson
in
the
midst
of
a
double
shuffle
had
clapped
his
hand
to
his
side
with
a
gasp
which
he
followed
by
a
whoop
of
anguish
he
had
got
a
stitch
or
had
started
a
twinge
somewhere
with
a
gesture
of
resignation
he
drew
himself
laboriously
out
of
the
dance
limping
abominably
one
leg
dragging
he
was
heard
asking
for
his
wife
old
broderson
took
him
in
charge
she
jawed
him
for
making
an
exhibition
of
himself
scolding
as
though
he
were
a
well
i
want
to
know
she
exclaimed
as
he
hobbled
off
dejected
and
melancholy
leaning
upon
her
arm
thought
he
had
to
dance
indeed
what
next
a
gay
old
grandpa
this
he
better
be
thinking
of
his
it
was
almost
midnight
the
dance
drew
towards
its
close
in
a
storm
of
jubilation
the
perspiring
musicians
toiled
like
galley
slaves
the
guests
singing
as
they
danced
the
group
of
men
reassembled
in
the
harness
room
even
magnus
derrick
condescended
to
enter
and
drink
a
toast
presley
and
vanamee
still
holding
themselves
aloof
looked
on
vanamee
more
and
more
disgusted
dabney
standing
to
one
side
overlooked
and
forgotten
continued
to
sip
steadily
at
his
glass
solemn
reserved
garnett
of
the
ruby
rancho
keast
from
the
ranch
of
the
same
name
gethings
of
the
san
pablo
and
chattern
of
the
bonanza
leaned
back
in
their
chairs
their
unbuttoned
their
legs
spread
wide
laughing
they
could
not
tell
why
other
ranchers
men
whom
annixter
had
never
seen
appeared
in
the
room
wheat
growers
from
places
as
far
distant
as
goshen
and
pixley
young
men
and
old
proprietors
of
veritable
principalities
hundreds
of
thousands
of
acres
of
wheat
lands
a
dozen
of
them
a
score
of
them
men
who
were
strangers
to
each
other
but
who
made
it
a
point
to
shake
hands
with
magnus
derrick
the
prominent
man
of
the
valley
old
broderson
whom
every
one
had
believed
had
gone
home
returned
though
much
sobered
and
took
his
place
refusing
however
to
drink
another
spoonful
soon
the
entire
number
of
annixter
guests
found
themselves
in
two
companies
the
dancers
on
the
floor
of
the
barn
frolicking
through
the
last
figures
of
the
virginia
reel
and
the
boisterous
gathering
of
men
in
the
harness
room
downing
the
last
quarts
of
fertiliser
both
assemblies
had
been
increased
even
the
older
people
had
joined
in
the
dance
while
nearly
every
one
of
the
men
who
did
not
dance
had
found
their
way
into
the
harness
room
the
two
groups
rivalled
each
other
in
their
noise
out
on
the
floor
of
the
barn
was
a
very
whirlwind
of
gayety
a
tempest
of
laughter
and
cries
of
amusement
in
the
harness
room
the
confused
shouting
and
singing
the
stamping
of
heavy
feet
set
a
quivering
reverberation
in
the
oil
of
the
kerosene
lamps
the
flame
of
the
candles
in
the
japanese
lanterns
flaring
and
swaying
in
the
gusts
of
hilarity
at
intervals
between
the
two
one
heard
the
music
the
wailing
of
the
violins
the
vigorous
snarling
of
the
cornet
and
the
harsh
incessant
rasping
of
the
snare
drum
and
at
times
all
these
various
sounds
mingled
in
a
single
vague
note
huge
clamorous
that
rose
up
into
the
night
from
the
colossal
reverberating
compass
of
the
barn
and
sent
its
echoes
far
off
across
the
unbroken
levels
of
the
surrounding
ranches
stretching
out
to
infinity
under
the
clouded
sky
calm
mysterious
still
annixter
the
punch
bowl
clasped
in
his
arms
was
pouring
out
the
last
spoonful
of
liquor
into
caraher
glass
when
he
was
aware
that
some
one
was
pulling
at
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
he
set
down
the
punch
bowl
well
where
did
you
come
from
he
demanded
it
was
a
messenger
from
bonneville
the
uniformed
boy
that
the
telephone
company
employed
to
carry
messages
he
had
just
arrived
from
town
on
his
bicycle
out
of
breath
and
panting
message
for
you
sir
will
you
sign
he
held
the
book
to
annixter
who
signed
the
receipt
wondering
the
boy
departed
leaving
a
thick
envelope
of
yellow
paper
in
hands
the
address
typewritten
the
word
urgent
written
in
blue
pencil
in
one
corner
annixter
tore
it
open
the
envelope
contained
other
sealed
envelopes
some
eight
or
ten
of
them
addressed
to
magnus
derrick
osterman
broderson
garnett
keast
gethings
chattern
dabney
and
to
annixter
himself
still
puzzled
annixter
distributed
the
envelopes
muttering
to
himself
what
up
now
the
incident
had
attracted
attention
a
comparative
quiet
followed
the
guests
following
the
letters
with
their
eyes
as
they
were
passed
around
the
table
they
fancied
that
annixter
had
arranged
a
surprise
magnus
derrick
who
sat
next
to
annixter
was
the
first
to
receive
his
letter
with
a
word
of
excuse
he
opened
it
read
it
read
it
governor
shouted
a
voices
no
secrets
you
know
everything
above
board
here
magnus
cast
a
glance
at
the
contents
of
the
letter
then
rose
to
his
feet
and
read
magnus
derrick
bonneville
tulare
cal
dear
sir
by
regrade
of
october
the
value
of
the
railroad
land
you
occupy
included
in
your
ranch
of
los
muertos
has
been
fixed
at
per
acre
the
land
is
now
for
sale
at
that
price
to
any
one
yours
cyrus
blakelee
ruggles
land
agent
and
behrman
local
agent
and
in
the
midst
of
the
profound
silence
that
followed
osterman
was
heard
to
exclaim
grimly
that
a
pretty
good
one
tell
us
but
for
a
long
moment
this
was
the
only
remark
the
silence
widened
broken
only
by
the
sound
of
torn
paper
as
annixter
osterman
old
broderson
garnett
keast
gethings
chattern
and
dabney
opened
and
read
their
letters
they
were
all
to
the
same
effect
almost
word
for
word
like
the
governor
only
the
figures
and
the
proper
names
varied
in
some
cases
the
price
per
acre
was
dollars
in
annixter
case
it
was
thirty
and
and
the
company
promised
to
sell
to
me
to
to
all
of
us
gasped
old
broderson
at
two
dollars
and
a
half
an
it
was
not
alone
the
ranchers
immediately
around
bonneville
who
would
be
plundered
by
this
move
on
the
part
of
the
railroad
the
alternate
section
system
applied
throughout
all
the
san
joaquin
by
striking
at
the
bonneville
ranchers
a
terrible
precedent
was
established
of
the
crowd
of
guests
in
the
harness
room
alone
nearly
every
man
was
affected
every
man
menaced
with
ruin
all
of
a
million
acres
was
suddenly
involved
then
suddenly
the
tempest
burst
a
dozen
men
were
on
their
feet
in
an
instant
their
teeth
set
their
fists
clenched
their
faces
purple
with
rage
oaths
curses
maledictions
exploded
like
the
firing
of
successive
mines
voices
quivered
with
wrath
hands
flung
upward
the
fingers
hooked
prehensile
trembled
with
anger
the
sense
of
wrongs
the
injustices
the
oppression
extortion
and
pillage
of
twenty
years
suddenly
culminated
and
found
voice
in
a
raucous
howl
of
execration
for
a
second
there
was
nothing
articulate
in
that
cry
of
savage
exasperation
nothing
even
intelligent
it
was
the
human
animal
hounded
to
its
corner
exploited
harried
to
its
last
stand
at
bay
ferocious
terrible
turning
at
last
with
bared
teeth
and
upraised
claws
to
meet
the
death
grapple
it
was
the
hideous
squealing
of
the
tormented
brute
its
back
to
the
wall
defending
its
lair
its
mate
and
its
whelps
ready
to
bite
to
rend
to
trample
to
batter
out
the
life
of
the
enemy
in
a
primeval
bestial
welter
of
blood
and
fury
the
roar
subsided
to
intermittent
clamour
in
the
pauses
of
which
the
sounds
of
music
and
dancing
made
themselves
audible
once
more
s
behrman
again
vociferated
harran
derrick
chose
his
moment
well
muttered
annixter
hits
his
hardest
when
all
rounded
up
having
a

is
what
to
be
done
now
fight
my
god
do
you
think
we
are
going
to
stand
this
do
you
think
we
can
the
uproar
swelled
again
the
clearer
the
assembly
of
ranchers
understood
the
significance
of
this
move
on
the
part
of
the
railroad
the
more
terrible
it
appeared
the
more
flagrant
the
more
intolerable
was
it
possible
was
it
within
the
bounds
of
imagination
that
this
tyranny
should
be
contemplated
but
they
knew
past
years
had
driven
home
the
lesson
the
implacable
iron
monster
with
whom
they
had
to
deal
and
again
and
again
the
sense
of
outrage
and
oppression
lashed
them
to
their
feet
their
mouths
wide
with
curses
their
fists
clenched
tight
their
throats
hoarse
with
shouting
fight
how
fight
what
are
you
going
to
do

annixter
made
himself
heard
all
out
of
the
room
but
the

owners
he
shouted

of

dabney
ignored
silent
to
whom
nobody
spoke
and
who
as
yet
had
not
uttered
a
word
but
the
men
who
had
been
asked
to
leave
the
harness
room
spread
the
news
throughout
the
barn
it
was
repeated
from
lip
to
lip
one
by
one
the
guests
dropped
out
of
the
dance
groups
were
formed
by
swift
degrees
the
gayety
lapsed
away
the
virginia
reel
broke
up
the
musicians
ceased
playing
and
in
the
place
of
the
noisy
effervescent
revelry
of
the
previous
half
hour
a
subdued
murmur
filled
all
the
barn
a
mingling
of
whispers
lowered
voices
the
coming
and
going
of
light
footsteps
the
uneasy
shifting
of
positions
while
from
behind
the
closed
doors
of
the
harness
room
came
a
prolonged
sullen
hum
of
anger
and
strenuous
debate
the
dance
came
to
an
abrupt
end
the
guests
unwilling
to
go
as
yet
stunned
distressed
stood
clumsily
about
their
eyes
vague
their
hands
swinging
at
their
sides
looking
stupidly
into
each
others
faces
a
sense
of
impending
calamity
oppressive
foreboding
gloomy
passed
through
the
air
overhead
in
the
night
a
long
shiver
of
anguish
and
of
terror
mysterious
despairing
in
the
harness
room
however
the
excitement
continued
unchecked
one
rancher
after
another
delivered
himself
of
a
torrent
of
furious
words
there
was
no
order
merely
the
frenzied
outcry
of
blind
fury
one
spirit
alone
was
common
to
all
resistance
at
whatever
cost
and
to
whatever
lengths
suddenly
osterman
leaped
to
his
feet
his
bald
head
gleaming
in
the
his
red
ears
distended
a
flood
of
words
filling
his
great
horizontal
slit
of
a
mouth
his
comic
actor
face
flaming
like
the
hero
of
a
melodrama
he
took
stage
with
a
great
sweeping
gesture
organisation
he
shouted
that
must
be
our
the
curse
of
the
ranchers
is
that
they
fritter
away
their
strength
now
we
must
stand
together
now
now
here
the
crisis
here
the
moment
shall
we
meet
it
i
call
for
the
league
not
next
week
not
not
in
the
morning
but
now
now
now
this
very
moment
before
we
go
out
of
that
door
every
one
of
us
here
to
join
it
to
form
the
beginnings
of
a
vast
organisation
banded
together
to
death
if
needs
be
for
the
protection
of
our
rights
and
homes
are
you
ready
is
it
now
or
never
i
call
for
the
instantly
there
was
a
shout
with
an
actor
instinct
osterman
had
spoken
at
the
precise
psychological
moment
he
carried
the
others
off
their
feet
glib
dexterous
voluble
just
what
was
meant
by
the
league
the
others
did
not
know
but
it
was
something
a
vague
engine
a
machine
with
which
to
fight
osterman
had
not
done
speaking
before
the
room
rang
with
outcries
the
crowd
of
men
shouting
for
what
they
did
not
know
the
league
the
league
now
this
moment
sign
our
names
before
we
he
right
organisation
the
league
we
have
a
committee
at
work
already
osterman
vociferated
i
am
a
member
and
also
broderson
annixter
and
harran
derrick
what
our
aims
are
we
will
explain
to
you
later
let
this
committee
be
the
nucleus
of
the
league
temporarily
at
least
trust
us
we
are
working
for
you
and
with
you
let
this
committee
be
merged
into
the
larger
committee
of
the
league
and
for
president
of
the
league
he
paused
the
fraction
of
a
second
for
president
there
can
be
but
one
name
mentioned
one
man
to
whom
we
all
must
look
as
leader
magnus
the
governor
name
was
received
with
a
storm
of
cheers
the
harness
room
reechoed
with
shouts
of
derrick
derrick
magnus
for
president
derrick
our
natural
derrick
derrick
derrick
for
magnus
rose
to
his
feet
he
made
no
gesture
erect
as
a
cavalry
officer
tall
thin
commanding
he
dominated
the
crowd
in
an
instant
there
was
a
moment
hush
gentlemen
he
said
if
organisation
is
a
good
word
moderation
is
a
better
one
the
matter
is
too
grave
for
haste
i
would
suggest
that
we
each
and
severally
return
to
our
respective
homes
for
the
night
sleep
over
what
has
happened
and
convene
again
when
we
are
calmer
and
can
approach
this
affair
in
a
more
judicious
mood
as
for
the
honour
with
which
you
would
inform
me
i
must
affirm
that
that
too
is
a
matter
for
grave
deliberation
this
league
is
but
a
name
as
yet
to
accept
control
of
an
organisation
whose
principles
are
not
yet
fixed
is
a
heavy
responsibility
i
shrink
from
it
but
he
was
allowed
to
proceed
no
farther
a
storm
of
protest
developed
there
were
shouts
of
no
no
the
league
and
derrick
for
we
have
been
moderate
too
the
league
first
principles
we
ca
wait
declared
osterman
many
of
us
can
not
attend
a
meeting
our
business
affairs
would
prevent
it
now
we
are
all
together
i
propose
a
temporary
chairman
and
secretary
be
named
and
a
ballot
be
taken
but
first
the
league
let
us
draw
up
a
set
of
resolutions
to
stand
together
for
the
defence
of
our
homes
to
death
if
needs
be
and
each
man
present
affix
his
signature
he
subsided
amidst
vigorous
applause
the
next
quarter
of
an
hour
was
a
vague
confusion
every
one
talking
at
once
conversations
going
on
in
low
tones
in
various
corners
of
the
room
ink
pens
and
a
sheaf
of
foolscap
were
brought
from
the
ranch
house
a
set
of
resolutions
was
draughted
having
the
force
of
a
pledge
organising
the
league
of
defence
annixter
was
the
first
to
sign
others
followed
only
a
few
holding
back
refusing
to
join
till
they
had
thought
the
matter
over
the
roll
grew
the
paper
circulated
about
the
table
each
signature
was
welcomed
by
a
salvo
of
cheers
at
length
it
reached
harran
derrick
who
signed
amid
tremendous
uproar
he
released
the
pen
only
to
shake
a
score
of
hands
now
magnus
gentlemen
began
the
governor
once
more
rising
i
beg
of
you
to
allow
me
further
consideration
gentlemen
he
was
interrupted
by
renewed
shouting
no
no
now
or
never
sign
join
the
do
leave
us
we
look
to
you
to
but
presently
the
excited
throng
that
turned
their
faces
towards
the
governor
were
aware
of
a
new
face
at
his
elbow
the
door
of
the
harness
room
had
been
left
unbolted
and
derrick
unable
to
endure
the
suspense
of
waiting
outside
had
gathered
up
all
her
courage
and
had
come
into
the
room
trembling
she
clung
to
arm
her
pretty
hair
in
disarray
her
large
young
eyes
wide
with
terror
and
distrust
what
was
about
to
happen
she
did
not
understand
but
these
men
were
clamouring
for
magnus
to
pledge
himself
to
something
to
some
terrible
course
of
action
some
ruthless
unscrupulous
battle
to
the
death
with
the
monster
of
steel
and
steam
nerved
with
a
coward
intrepidity
she
who
so
easily
obliterated
herself
had
found
her
way
into
the
midst
of
this
frantic
crowd
into
this
hot
close
room
reeking
of
alcohol
and
tobacco
smoke
into
this
atmosphere
surcharged
with
hatred
and
curses
she
seized
her
husband
arm
imploring
distraught
with
terror
no
no
she
murmured
no
do
she
was
the
feather
caught
in
the
whirlwind
en
masse
the
crowd
surged
toward
the
erect
figure
of
the
governor
the
pen
in
one
hand
his
fingers
in
the
other
the
roll
of
signatures
before
him
the
clamour
was
deafening
the
excitement
culminated
brusquely
half
a
hundred
hands
stretched
toward
him
thirty
voices
at
top
pitch
implored
expostulated
urged
almost
commanded
the
reverberation
of
the
shouting
was
as
the
plunge
of
a
cataract
it
was
the
uprising
of
the
people
the
thunder
of
the
outbreak
of
revolt
the
mob
demanding
to
be
led
aroused
at
last
imperious
resistless
overwhelming
it
was
the
blind
fury
of
insurrection
the
brute
bellowing
for
guidance
baring
its
teeth
unsheathing
its
claws
imposing
its
will
with
the
abrupt
resistless
pressure
of
the
relaxed
piston
inexorable
knowing
no
pity
no
no
implored
annie
derrick
no
magnus
do
he
must
declared
harran
shouting
in
her
ear
to
make
himself
heard
he
must
do
you
understand
again
the
crowd
surged
forward
roaring
derrick
was
swept
back
pushed
to
one
side
her
husband
no
longer
belonged
to
her
she
paid
the
penalty
for
being
the
wife
of
a
great
man
the
world
like
a
colossal
iron
wedge
crushed
itself
between
she
was
thrust
to
the
wall
the
throng
of
men
stamping
surrounded
magnus
she
could
no
longer
see
him
but
she
listened
there
was
a
moment
lull
then
a
vast
thunder
of
savage
jubilation
magnus
had
signed
harran
found
his
mother
leaning
against
the
wall
her
hands
shut
over
her
ears
her
eyes
dilated
with
fear
brimming
with
tears
he
led
her
from
the
harness
room
to
the
outer
room
where
tree
and
hilma
took
charge
of
her
and
then
impatient
refusing
to
answer
the
hundreds
of
anxious
questions
that
assailed
him
hurried
back
to
the
harness
room
already
the
balloting
was
in
progress
osterman
acting
as
temporary
chairman
on
the
very
first
ballot
he
was
made
secretary
of
the
league
pro
and
magnus
unanimously
chosen
for
its
president
an
executive
committee
was
formed
which
was
to
meet
the
next
day
at
the
los
muertos
ranch
house
it
was
one
in
the
barn
outside
the
greater
number
of
the
guests
had
departed
long
since
the
musicians
had
disappeared
there
only
remained
the
families
of
the
ranch
owners
involved
in
the
meeting
in
the
harness
room
these
huddled
in
isolated
groups
in
corners
of
the
garish
echoing
barn
the
women
in
their
wraps
the
young
men
with
their
coat
collars
turned
up
against
the
draughts
that
once
more
made
themselves
felt
for
a
long
half
hour
the
loud
hum
of
eager
conversation
continued
to
issue
from
behind
the
door
of
the
harness
room
then
at
length
there
was
a
prolonged
scraping
of
chairs
the
session
was
over
the
men
came
out
in
groups
searching
for
their
families
at
once
the
homeward
movement
began
every
one
was
worn
out
some
of
the
ranchers
daughters
had
gone
to
sleep
against
their
mothers
shoulders
billy
the
stableman
and
his
assistant
were
awakened
and
the
teams
were
hitched
up
the
stable
yard
was
full
of
a
maze
of
swinging
lanterns
and
buggy
lamps
the
horses
fretted
champing
the
bits
the
creaked
with
the
straining
of
leather
and
springs
as
they
received
their
loads
at
every
instant
one
heard
the
rattle
of
wheels
as
vehicle
after
vehicle
disappeared
in
the
night
a
fine
drizzling
rain
was
falling
and
the
lamps
began
to
show
dim
in
a
vague
haze
of
orange
light
magnus
derrick
was
the
last
to
go
at
the
doorway
of
the
barn
he
found
annixter
the
roll
of
names
which
it
had
been
decided
he
was
to
keep
in
his
safe
for
the
moment
under
his
arm
silently
the
two
shook
hands
magnus
departed
the
grind
of
the
wheels
of
his
grated
sharply
on
the
gravel
of
the
driveway
in
front
of
the
ranch
house
then
with
a
hollow
roll
across
a
little
plank
bridge
gained
the
roadway
for
a
moment
the
beat
of
the
horses
hoofs
made
itself
heard
on
the
roadway
it
ceased
suddenly
there
was
a
great
silence
annixter
in
the
doorway
of
the
great
barn
stood
looking
about
him
for
a
moment
alone
thoughtful
the
barn
was
empty
that
astonishing
evening
had
come
to
an
end
the
whirl
of
things
and
people
the
crowd
of
dancers
delaney
the
gun
fight
hilma
tree
her
eyes
fixed
on
him
in
mute
confession
the
rabble
in
the
harness
room
the
news
of
the
regrade
the
fierce
outburst
of
wrath
the
hasty
organising
of
the
league
all
went
spinning
confusedly
through
his
recollection
but
he
was
exhausted
time
enough
in
the
morning
to
think
it
all
over
by
now
it
was
raining
sharply
he
put
the
roll
of
names
into
his
inside
pocket
threw
a
sack
over
his
head
and
shoulders
and
went
down
to
the
ranch
house
but
in
the
harness
room
lighted
by
the
glittering
lanterns
and
flaring
lamps
in
the
midst
of
overturned
chairs
spilled
liquor
cigar
stumps
and
broken
glasses
vanamee
and
presley
still
remained
talking
talking
at
length
they
rose
and
came
out
upon
the
floor
of
the
barn
and
stood
for
a
moment
looking
about
them
billy
the
stableman
was
going
the
rounds
of
the
walls
putting
out
light
after
light
by
degrees
the
vast
interior
was
growing
dim
upon
the
roof
overhead
the
rain
drummed
incessantly
the
eaves
dripping
the
floor
was
littered
with
pine
needles
bits
of
orange
peel
ends
and
fragments
of
torn
organdies
and
muslins
and
bits
of
tissue
paper
from
the
phrygian
bonnets
and
liberty
the
buckskin
mare
in
the
stall
dozing
on
three
legs
changed
position
with
a
long
sigh
the
sweat
stiffening
the
hair
upon
her
back
and
loins
as
it
dried
gave
off
a
penetrating
ammoniacal
odour
that
mingled
with
the
stale
perfume
of
sachet
and
wilted
flowers
presley
and
vanamee
stood
looking
at
the
deserted
barn
there
was
a
long
silence
then
presley
said
well
what
do
you
think
of
it
all
i
think
answered
vanamee
slowly
i
think
that
there
was
a
dance
in
brussels
the
night
before
book
ii
chapter
i
in
his
office
at
san
francisco
seated
before
a
massive
desk
of
polished
redwood
very
ornate
lyman
derrick
sat
dictating
letters
to
his
typewriter
on
a
certain
morning
early
in
the
spring
of
the
year
the
subdued
monotone
of
his
voice
proceeded
evenly
from
sentence
to
sentence
regular
precise
businesslike
i
have
the
honour
to
acknowledge
herewith
your
favour
of
the
instant
and
in
reply
would
state
please
find
enclosed
draft
upon
new
orleans
to
be
applied
as
per
our
understanding
in
answer
to
your
favour
no
referring
to
the
case
of
the
city
and
county
of
san
francisco
against
excelsior
warehouse
storage
i
would
say
his
voice
continued
expressionless
measured
distinct
while
he
spoke
he
swung
slowly
back
and
forth
in
his
leather
swivel
chair
his
elbows
resting
on
the
arms
his
pop
eyes
fixed
vaguely
upon
the
calendar
on
the
opposite
wall
winking
at
intervals
when
he
paused
searching
for
a
word
that
all
for
the
present
he
said
at
length
without
reply
the
typewriter
rose
and
withdrew
thrusting
her
pencil
into
the
coil
of
her
hair
closing
the
door
behind
her
softly
discreetly
when
she
had
gone
lyman
rose
stretching
himself
putting
up
three
fingers
to
hide
his
yawn
to
further
loosen
his
muscles
he
took
a
couple
of
turns
the
length
of
he
room
noting
with
satisfaction
its
fine
appointments
the
padded
red
carpet
the
dull
olive
green
tint
of
the
walls
the
few
choice
engravings
portraits
of
marshall
taney
field
and
a
coloured
lithograph
excellently
done
of
the
grand
canyon
of
the
colorado
the
leather
chairs
the
large
and
crowded
bookcase
topped
with
a
bust
of
james
lick
and
a
huge
greenish
globe
the
waste
basket
of
woven
coloured
grass
made
by
navajo
indians
the
massive
silver
inkstand
on
the
desk
the
elaborate
filing
cabinet
complete
in
every
particular
and
the
shelves
of
tin
boxes
padlocked
impressive
grave
bearing
the
names
of
clients
cases
and
estates
he
was
between
and
years
of
age
unlike
harran
he
resembled
his
mother
but
he
was
much
darker
than
annie
derrick
and
his
eyes
were
much
fuller
the
eyeball
protruding
giving
him
a
foreign
expression
quite
unusual
and
unexpected
his
hair
was
black
and
he
wore
a
small
tight
pointed
mustache
which
he
was
in
the
habit
of
pushing
delicately
upward
from
the
corners
of
his
lips
with
the
ball
of
his
thumb
the
little
finger
extended
as
often
as
he
made
this
gesture
he
prefaced
it
with
a
little
twisting
gesture
of
the
forearm
in
order
to
bring
his
cuff
into
view
and
in
fact
this
movement
by
itself
was
habitual
he
was
dressed
carefully
his
trousers
creased
a
pink
rose
in
his
lapel
his
shoes
were
of
patent
leather
his
cutaway
coat
was
of
very
rough
black
cheviot
his
waistcoat
of
tan
covered
cloth
with
buttons
of
smoked
pearl
an
ascot
scarf
a
great
puff
of
heavy
black
silk
was
at
his
neck
the
knot
transfixed
by
a
tiny
golden
pin
set
off
with
an
opal
and
four
small
diamonds
at
one
end
of
the
room
were
two
great
windows
of
plate
glass
and
pausing
at
length
before
one
of
these
lyman
selected
a
cigarette
from
his
curved
box
of
oxydized
silver
lit
it
and
stood
looking
down
and
out
willing
to
be
idle
for
a
moment
amused
and
interested
in
the
view
his
office
was
on
the
tenth
floor
of
the
exchange
building
a
beautiful
affair
of
white
stone
that
stood
on
the
corner
of
market
street
near
its
intersection
with
kearney
the
most
imposing
office
building
of
the
city
below
him
the
city
swarmed
tumultuous
through
its
grooves
the
starting
and
stopping
with
a
gay
jangling
of
bells
and
a
strident
whirring
of
jostled
glass
windows
drays
and
carts
clattered
over
the
cobbles
and
an
incessant
shuffling
of
thousands
of
feet
rose
from
the
pavement
around
lotta
fountain
the
baskets
of
the
flower
sellers
crammed
with
chrysanthemums
violets
pinks
roses
lilies
hyacinths
set
a
brisk
note
of
colour
in
the
grey
of
the
street
but
to
lyman
notion
the
general
impression
of
this
centre
of
the
city
life
was
not
one
of
strenuous
business
activity
it
was
a
continuous
interest
in
small
things
a
people
ever
willing
to
be
amused
at
trifles
refusing
to
consider
serious
matters
allowing
themselves
to
be
imposed
upon
taking
life
easily
generous
companionable
enthusiastic
living
as
it
were
from
day
to
day
in
a
place
where
the
luxuries
of
life
were
had
without
effort
in
a
city
that
offered
to
consideration
the
restlessness
of
a
new
york
without
its
earnestness
the
serenity
of
a
naples
without
its
languor
the
romance
of
a
seville
without
its
picturesqueness
as
lyman
turned
from
the
window
about
to
resume
his
work
the
office
boy
appeared
at
the
door
the
man
from
the
lithograph
company
sir
announced
the
boy
well
what
does
he
want
demanded
lyman
adding
however
upon
the
instant
show
him
a
young
man
entered
carrying
a
great
bundle
which
he
deposited
on
a
chair
with
a
gasp
of
relief
exclaiming
all
out
of
breath
from
the
standard
lithograph
what
is
do
know
replied
the
other
maps
i
i
do
want
any
maps
who
sent
them
i
guess
you
lyman
tore
the
cover
from
the
top
of
the
package
drawing
out
one
of
a
great
many
huge
sheets
of
white
paper
folded
eight
times
suddenly
he
uttered
an
exclamation
ah
i
see
they
are
maps
but
these
should
not
have
come
here
they
are
to
go
to
the
regular
office
for
he
wrote
a
new
direction
on
the
label
of
the
package
take
them
to
that
address
he
went
on
i
keep
this
one
here
the
others
go
to
that
address
if
you
see
darrell
tell
him
that
derrick
you
get
the
name
derrick
may
not
be
able
to
get
around
this
afternoon
but
to
go
ahead
with
any
business
just
the
the
young
man
departed
with
the
package
and
lyman
spreading
out
the
map
upon
the
table
remained
for
some
time
studying
it
thoughtfully
it
was
a
commissioner
official
railway
map
of
the
state
of
california
completed
to
march
of
that
year
upon
it
the
different
railways
of
the
state
were
accurately
plotted
in
various
colours
blue
green
yellow
however
the
blue
the
yellow
and
the
green
were
but
brief
traceries
very
short
isolated
unimportant
at
a
little
distance
these
could
hardly
be
seen
the
whole
map
was
gridironed
by
a
vast
complicated
network
of
red
lines
marked
and
these
centralised
at
san
francisco
and
thence
ramified
and
spread
north
east
and
south
to
every
quarter
of
the
state
from
coles
in
the
topmost
corner
of
the
map
to
yuma
in
the
lowest
from
reno
on
one
side
to
san
francisco
on
the
other
ran
the
plexus
of
red
a
veritable
system
of
blood
circulation
complicated
dividing
and
reuniting
branching
splitting
extending
throwing
out
feelers
tap
roots
feeders
diminutive
little
blood
suckers
that
shot
out
from
the
main
jugular
and
went
twisting
up
into
some
remote
county
laying
hold
upon
some
forgotten
village
or
town
involving
it
in
one
of
a
myriad
branching
coils
one
of
a
hundred
tentacles
drawing
it
as
it
were
toward
that
centre
from
which
all
this
system
sprang
the
map
was
white
and
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
colour
which
should
have
gone
to
vivify
the
various
counties
towns
and
cities
marked
upon
it
had
been
absorbed
by
that
huge
sprawling
organism
with
its
ruddy
arteries
converging
to
a
central
point
it
was
as
though
the
state
had
been
sucked
white
and
colourless
and
against
this
pallid
background
the
red
arteries
of
the
monster
stood
out
swollen
with
reaching
out
to
infinity
gorged
to
bursting
an
excrescence
a
gigantic
parasite
fattening
upon
the
of
an
entire
commonwealth
however
in
an
upper
corner
of
the
map
appeared
the
names
of
the
three
new
commissioners
jones
mcnish
for
the
first
district
lyman
derrick
for
the
second
and
james
darrell
for
the
third
nominated
in
the
democratic
state
convention
in
the
fall
of
the
preceding
year
lyman
backed
by
the
coteries
of
san
francisco
bosses
in
the
pay
of
his
father
political
committee
of
ranchers
had
been
elected
together
with
darrell
the
candidate
of
the
pueblo
and
mojave
road
and
mcnish
the
avowed
candidate
of
the
pacific
and
southwestern
darrell
was
rabidly
against
the
and
mcnish
rabidly
for
it
lyman
was
supposed
to
be
the
conservative
member
of
the
board
the
ranchers
candidate
it
was
true
and
faithful
to
their
interests
but
a
calm
man
deliberative
swayed
by
no
such
violent
emotions
as
his
colleagues
osterman
dexterity
had
at
last
succeeded
in
entangling
magnus
inextricably
in
the
new
politics
the
famous
league
organised
in
the
heat
of
passion
the
night
of
annixter
barn
dance
had
been
consolidated
all
through
the
winter
months
its
executive
committee
of
which
magnus
was
chairman
had
been
through
osterman
manipulation
merged
into
the
old
committee
composed
of
broderson
annixter
and
himself
promptly
thereat
he
had
resigned
the
chairmanship
of
this
committee
thus
leaving
magnus
at
its
head
precisely
as
osterman
had
planned
magnus
was
now
one
of
them
the
new
committee
accordingly
had
two
objects
in
view
to
resist
the
attempted
grabbing
of
their
lands
by
the
railroad
and
to
push
forward
their
own
secret
scheme
of
electing
a
board
of
railroad
commissioners
who
should
regulate
wheat
rates
so
as
to
favour
the
ranchers
of
the
san
joaquin
the
land
cases
were
promptly
taken
to
the
courts
and
the
new
grading
fixing
the
price
of
the
lands
at
twenty
and
thirty
dollars
an
acre
instead
of
two
bitterly
and
stubbornly
fought
but
delays
occurred
the
process
of
the
law
was
interminable
and
in
the
intervals
the
committee
addressed
itself
to
the
work
of
seating
the
ranchers
commission
as
the
projected
board
of
commissioners
came
to
be
called
it
was
harran
who
first
suggested
that
his
brother
lyman
be
put
forward
as
the
candidate
for
this
district
at
once
the
proposition
had
a
great
success
lyman
seemed
made
for
the
place
while
allied
by
every
tie
of
blood
to
the
ranching
interests
he
had
never
been
identified
with
them
he
was
the
railroad
would
not
be
of
him
he
was
a
good
lawyer
a
good
business
man
keen
had
already
some
practical
knowledge
of
politics
having
served
a
term
as
assistant
district
attorney
and
even
at
the
present
moment
occupying
the
position
of
sheriff
attorney
more
than
all
he
was
the
son
of
magnus
derrick
he
could
be
relied
upon
could
be
trusted
implicitly
to
remain
loyal
to
the
ranchers
cause
the
campaign
for
railroad
commissioner
had
been
very
interesting
at
the
very
outset
magnus
committee
found
itself
involved
in
corrupt
politics
the
primaries
had
to
be
captured
at
all
costs
and
by
any
means
and
when
the
convention
assembled
it
was
found
necessary
to
buy
outright
the
votes
of
certain
delegates
the
campaign
fund
raised
by
contributions
from
magnus
annixter
broderson
and
osterman
was
drawn
upon
to
the
extent
of
five
thousand
dollars
only
the
committee
knew
of
this
corruption
the
league
ignoring
ways
and
means
supposed
as
a
matter
of
course
that
the
campaign
was
honorably
conducted
for
a
whole
week
after
the
consummation
of
this
part
of
the
deal
magnus
had
kept
to
his
house
refusing
to
be
seen
alleging
that
he
was
ill
which
was
not
far
from
the
truth
the
shame
of
the
business
the
loathing
of
what
he
had
done
were
to
him
things
unspeakable
he
could
no
longer
look
harran
in
the
face
he
began
a
course
of
deception
with
his
wife
more
than
once
he
had
resolved
to
break
with
the
whole
affair
resigning
his
position
allowing
the
others
to
proceed
without
him
but
now
it
was
too
late
he
was
pledged
he
had
joined
the
league
he
was
its
chief
and
his
defection
might
mean
its
disintegration
at
the
very
time
when
it
needed
all
its
strength
to
fight
the
land
cases
more
than
a
mere
deal
in
bad
politics
was
involved
there
was
the
land
grab
his
withdrawal
from
an
unholy
cause
would
mean
the
weakening
perhaps
the
collapse
of
another
cause
that
he
believed
to
be
righteous
as
truth
itself
he
was
hopelessly
caught
in
the
mesh
wrong
seemed
indissolubly
knitted
into
the
texture
of
right
he
was
blinded
dizzied
overwhelmed
caught
in
the
current
of
events
and
hurried
along
he
knew
not
where
he
resigned
himself
in
the
end
and
after
much
ostentatious
opposition
on
the
part
of
the
railroad
heelers
lyman
was
nominated
and
subsequently
elected
when
this
consummation
was
reached
magnus
osterman
broderson
and
annixter
stared
at
each
other
their
wildest
hopes
had
not
dared
to
fix
themselves
upon
so
easy
a
victory
as
this
it
was
not
believable
that
the
corporation
would
allow
itself
to
be
fooled
so
easily
would
rush
into
the
trap
how
had
it
happened
osterman
however
threw
his
hat
into
the
air
with
wild
whoops
of
delight
old
broderson
permitted
himself
a
feeble
cheer
even
magnus
beamed
satisfaction
the
other
members
of
the
league
present
at
the
time
shook
hands
all
around
and
spoke
of
opening
a
few
bottles
on
the
strength
of
the
occasion
annixter
alone
was
recalcitrant
it
too
easy
he
declared
no
i
not
satisfied
where
shelgrim
in
all
this
why
do
he
show
his
hand
damn
his
soul
the
thing
is
yellow
i
tell
you
there
a
big
fish
in
these
waters
somewheres
i
do
know
his
name
and
i
do
know
his
game
but
he
moving
round
off
and
on
just
out
of
sight
if
you
think
you
netted
him
i
do
that
all
i
got
to
but
he
was
jeered
down
as
a
croaker
there
was
the
commission
he
could
get
around
that
could
he
there
was
darrell
and
lyman
derrick
both
pledged
to
the
ranches
good
lord
he
was
never
satisfied
he
be
obstinate
till
the
very
last
gun
was
fired
why
if
he
got
drowned
in
a
river
he
float
upstream
just
to
be
contrary
in
the
course
of
time
the
new
board
was
seated
for
the
first
few
months
of
its
term
it
was
occupied
in
clearing
up
the
business
left
over
by
the
old
board
and
in
the
completion
of
the
railway
map
but
now
the
decks
were
cleared
it
was
about
to
address
itself
to
the
consideration
of
a
revision
of
the
tariff
for
the
carriage
of
grain
between
the
san
joaquin
valley
and
both
lyman
and
darrell
were
pledged
to
an
average
ten
per
cent
cut
of
the
grain
rates
throughout
the
entire
state
the
typewriter
returned
with
the
letters
for
lyman
to
sign
and
he
put
away
the
map
and
took
up
his
morning
routine
of
business
wondering
the
while
what
would
become
of
his
practice
during
the
time
he
was
involved
in
the
business
of
the
ranchers
railroad
commission
but
towards
noon
at
the
moment
when
lyman
was
drawing
off
a
glass
of
mineral
water
from
the
siphon
that
stood
at
his
elbow
there
was
an
interruption
some
one
rapped
vigorously
upon
the
door
which
was
immediately
after
opened
and
magnus
and
harran
came
in
followed
by
presley
hello
hello
cried
lyman
jumping
up
extending
his
hands
why
here
a
surprise
i
did
expect
you
all
till
come
in
come
in
and
sit
down
have
a
glass
of
the
others
explained
that
they
had
come
up
from
bonneville
the
night
before
as
the
executive
committee
of
the
league
had
received
a
despatch
from
the
lawyers
it
had
retained
to
fight
the
railroad
that
the
judge
of
the
court
in
san
francisco
where
the
test
cases
were
being
tried
might
be
expected
to
hand
down
his
decision
the
next
day
very
soon
after
the
announcement
of
the
new
grading
of
the
lands
the
corporation
had
offered
through
behrman
to
lease
the
disputed
lands
to
the
ranchers
at
a
nominal
figure
the
offer
had
been
angrily
rejected
and
the
railroad
had
put
up
the
lands
for
sale
at
ruggles
office
in
bonneville
at
the
exorbitant
price
named
buyers
promptly
appeared
dummy
buyers
beyond
shadow
of
doubt
acting
either
for
the
railroad
or
for
behrman
men
hitherto
unknown
in
the
county
men
without
property
without
money
adventurers
heelers
prominent
among
them
and
bidding
for
the
railroad
holdings
included
on
annixter
ranch
was
delaney
the
farce
of
deeding
the
corporation
sections
to
these
fictitious
purchasers
was
solemnly
gone
through
with
at
ruggles
office
the
railroad
guaranteeing
them
possession
the
league
refused
to
allow
the
supposed
buyers
to
come
upon
the
land
and
the
railroad
faithful
to
its
pledge
in
the
matter
of
guaranteeing
its
dummies
possession
at
once
began
suits
in
ejectment
in
the
district
court
in
visalia
the
county
seat
it
was
the
preliminary
skirmish
the
reconnaisance
in
force
the
combatants
feeling
each
other
strength
willing
to
proceed
with
caution
postponing
the
actual
for
a
while
till
each
had
strengthened
its
position
and
organised
its
forces
during
the
time
the
cases
were
on
trial
at
visalia
behrman
was
much
in
evidence
in
and
about
the
courts
the
trial
itself
after
tedious
preliminaries
was
brief
the
ranchers
lost
the
test
cases
were
immediately
carried
up
to
the
united
states
circuit
court
in
san
francisco
at
the
moment
the
decision
of
this
court
was
pending
why
this
is
news
exclaimed
lyman
in
response
to
the
announcement
i
did
not
expect
them
to
be
so
prompt
i
was
in
court
only
last
week
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
end
of
business
ahead
i
suppose
you
are
very
anxious
magnus
nodded
he
had
seated
himself
in
one
of
lyman
deep
chairs
his
grey
with
its
wide
brim
on
the
floor
beside
him
his
coat
of
black
that
had
been
tightly
packed
in
his
valise
was
yet
wrinkled
and
creased
his
trousers
were
strapped
under
his
high
boots
as
he
spoke
he
stroked
the
bridge
of
his
hawklike
nose
with
his
bent
forefinger
in
his
chair
he
watched
his
two
sons
with
secret
delight
to
his
eye
both
were
perfect
specimens
of
their
class
intelligent
resourceful
he
was
intensely
proud
of
them
he
was
never
happier
never
more
nearly
jovial
never
more
erect
more
military
more
alert
and
buoyant
than
when
in
the
company
of
his
two
sons
he
honestly
believed
that
no
finer
examples
of
young
manhood
existed
throughout
the
entire
nation
i
think
we
should
win
in
this
court
harran
observed
watching
the
bubbles
break
in
his
glass
the
investigation
has
been
much
more
complete
than
in
the
visalia
trial
our
case
this
time
is
too
good
it
has
made
too
much
talk
the
court
would
not
dare
render
a
decision
for
the
railroad
why
there
the
agreement
in
black
and
white
and
the
circulars
the
railroad
issued
how
can
one
get
around
those
well
well
we
shall
know
in
a
few
hours
now
remarked
magnus
oh
exclaimed
lyman
surprised
it
is
for
this
morning
then
why
are
you
at
the
court
it
seemed
undignified
boy
answered
the
governor
we
shall
know
soon
good
god
exclaimed
harran
abruptly
when
i
think
of
what
is
involved
why
lyman
it
our
home
the
ranch
house
itself
nearly
all
los
muertos
practically
our
whole
fortune
and
just
now
when
there
is
promise
of
an
enormous
crop
of
wheat
and
it
is
not
only
us
there
are
over
half
a
million
acres
of
the
san
joaquin
involved
in
some
cases
of
the
smaller
ranches
it
is
the
confiscation
of
the
whole
of
the
rancher
land
if
this
thing
goes
through
it
will
absolutely
beggar
nearly
a
hundred
men
broderson
would
have
a
thousand
acres
to
his
name
why
it
but
the
corporations
offered
to
lease
these
lands
remarked
lyman
are
any
of
the
ranchers
taking
up
that
offer
or
are
any
of
them
buying
outright
buying
at
the
new
figure
exclaimed
harran
at
twenty
and
thirty
an
acre
why
there
not
one
in
ten
that
can
they
are
and
as
for
leasing
leasing
land
they
virtually
own
no
there
precious
few
are
doing
that
thank
god
that
would
be
acknowledging
the
ownership
right
away
forfeiting
their
rights
for
good
none
of
the
leaguers
are
doing
it
i
know
that
would
be
the
rankest
he
paused
for
a
moment
drinking
the
rest
of
the
mineral
water
then
interrupting
lyman
who
was
about
to
speak
to
presley
drawing
him
into
the
conversation
through
politeness
said
matters
are
just
romping
right
along
to
a
crisis
these
days
it
a
make
or
break
for
the
wheat
growers
of
the
state
now
no
mistake
here
are
the
land
cases
and
the
new
grain
tariff
drawing
to
a
head
at
about
the
same
time
if
we
win
our
land
cases
there
your
new
freight
rates
to
be
applied
and
then
all
is
beer
and
skittles
wo
the
san
joaquin
go
wild
if
we
pull
it
off
and
i
believe
we
how
we
wheat
growers
are
exploited
and
trapped
and
deceived
at
every
turn
observed
magnus
sadly
the
courts
the
capitalists
the
railroads
each
of
them
in
turn
hoodwinks
us
into
some
new
and
wonderful
scheme
only
to
betray
us
in
the
end
well
he
added
turning
to
lyman
one
thing
at
least
we
can
depend
on
we
will
cut
their
grain
rates
for
them
eh
lyman
lyman
crossed
his
legs
and
settled
himself
in
his
office
chair
i
have
wanted
to
have
a
talk
with
you
about
that
sir
he
said
yes
we
will
cut
the
rates
an
average
per
cent
cut
throughout
the
state
as
we
are
pledged
but
i
am
going
to
warn
you
governor
and
you
harran
do
expect
too
much
at
first
the
man
who
even
after
twenty
years

commission
the
whole
matter
has
become
so
confused
that
vanderbilt
himself
straighten
it
out
and
how
can
it
be
expected
that
railroad
commissions
who
are
chosen
well
let
be
frank
as
ours
was
for
instance
from
out
a
number
of
men
who
do
know
the
difference
between
a
switching
charge
and
a
differential

are
going

regulate
the
whole
business
in
six
months
time
cut
rates
yes
any
fool
can
do
that
any
fool
can
write
one
dollar
instead
of
two
but
if
you
cut
too
low
by
a
fraction
of
one
per
cent
and
if
the
railroad
can
get
out
an
injunction
tie
you
up
and
show
that
your
new
rate
prevents
the
road
being
operated
at
a
profit
how
are
you
any
better
off
your
conscientiousness
does
you
credit
lyman
said
the
governor
i
respect
you
for
it
my
son
i
know
you
will
be
fair
to
the
railroad
that
is
all
we
want
fairness
to
the
corporation
is
fairness
to
the
farmer
and
we
wo
expect
you
to
readjust
the
whole
matter
out
of
hand
take
your
time
we
can
afford
to
and
suppose
the
next
commission
is
a
railroad
board
and
reverses
all
our
figures
the
mining
king
the
most
redoubtable
poker
player
of
calaveras
county
permitted
himself
a
momentary
twinkle
of
his
eyes
by
then
it
will
be
too
late
we
will
all
of
us
have
made
our
fortunes
by
the
remark
left
presley
astonished
out
of
all
measure
he
never
could
accustom
himself
to
these
strange
lapses
in
the
governor
character
magnus
was
by
nature
a
public
man
judicious
deliberate
standing
firm
for
principle
yet
upon
rare
occasion
by
some
such
remark
as
this
he
would
betray
the
presence
of
a
of
recklessness
inconsistent
all
at
variance
with
his
creeds
and
tenets
at
the
very
bottom
when
all
was
said
and
done
magnus
remained
the
deep
down
in
his
heart
the
spirit
of
the
adventurer
yet
persisted
we
will
all
of
us
have
made
fortunes
by
that
was
it
precisely
after
us
the
for
all
his
public
spirit
for
all
his
championship
of
justice
and
truth
his
respect
for
law
magnus
remained
the
gambler
willing
to
play
for
colossal
stakes
to
hazard
a
fortune
on
the
chance
of
winning
a
million
it
was
the
true
california
spirit
that
found
expression
through
him
the
spirit
of
the
west
unwilling
to
occupy
itself
with
details
refusing
to
wait
to
be
patient
to
achieve
by
legitimate
plodding
the
miner
instinct
of
wealth
acquired
in
a
single
night
prevailed
in
spite
of
all
it
was
in
this
frame
of
mind
that
magnus
and
the
multitude
of
other
ranchers
of
whom
he
was
a
type
farmed
their
ranches
they
had
no
love
for
their
land
they
were
not
attached
to
the
soil
they
worked
their
ranches
as
a
quarter
of
a
century
before
they
had
worked
their
mines
to
husband
the
resources
of
their
marvellous
san
joaquin
they
considered
niggardly
petty
hebraic
to
get
all
there
was
out
of
the
land
to
squeeze
it
dry
to
exhaust
it
seemed
their
policy
when
at
last
the
land
worn
out
would
refuse
to
yield
they
would
invest
their
money
in
something
else
by
then
they
would
all
have
made
fortunes
they
did
not
care
after
us
the
lyman
however
was
obviously
uneasy
willing
to
change
the
subject
he
rose
to
his
feet
pulling
down
his
cuffs
by
the
way
he
observed
i
want
you
three
to
lunch
with
me
at
my
club
it
is
close
by
you
can
wait
there
for
news
of
the
decision
as
well
as
anywhere
else
and
i
should
like
to
show
you
the
place
i
have
just
at
the
club
when
the
four
men
were
seated
at
a
small
table
in
the
round
window
of
the
main
room
lyman
popularity
with
all
classes
was
very
apparent
hardly
a
man
entered
that
did
not
call
out
a
salutation
to
him
some
even
coming
over
to
shake
his
hand
he
seemed
to
be
every
man
friend
and
to
all
he
seemed
equally
genial
his
affability
even
to
those
whom
he
disliked
was
unfailing
see
that
fellow
yonder
he
said
to
magnus
indicating
a
certain
man
flamboyantly
dressed
who
wore
his
hair
long
who
was
afflicted
with
sore
eyes
and
the
collar
of
whose
velvet
coat
was
sprinkled
with
dandruff
that
hartrath
the
artist
a
man
absolutely
devoid
of
even
the
commonest
decency
how
he
got
in
here
is
a
mystery
to
yet
when
this
hartrath
came
across
to
say
how
do
you
do
to
lyman
lyman
was
as
eager
in
his
cordiality
as
his
warmest
friend
could
have
expected
why
the
devil
are
you
so
chummy
with
him
then
observed
harran
when
hartrath
had
gone
away
lyman
explanation
was
vague
the
truth
of
the
matter
was
that
magnus
oldest
son
was
consumed
by
inordinate
ambition
political
preferment
was
his
dream
and
to
the
realisation
of
this
dream
popularity
was
an
essential
every
man
who
could
vote
blackguard
or
gentleman
was
to
be
conciliated
if
possible
he
made
it
his
study
to
become
known
throughout
the
entire
community
to
put
influential
men
under
obligations
to
himself
he
never
forgot
a
name
or
a
face
with
everybody
he
was
the
his
ambition
was
not
trivial
in
his
disregard
for
small
things
he
resembled
his
father
municipal
office
had
no
attraction
for
him
his
goal
was
higher
he
had
planned
his
life
twenty
years
ahead
already
sheriff
attorney
assistant
district
attorney
and
railroad
commissioner
he
could
if
he
desired
attain
the
office
of
district
attorney
itself
just
now
it
was
a
question
with
him
whether
or
not
it
would
be
politic
to
fill
this
office
would
it
advance
or
sidetrack
him
in
the
career
he
had
outlined
for
himself
lyman
wanted
to
be
something
better
than
district
attorney
better
than
mayor
than
state
senator
or
even
than
member
of
the
united
states
congress
he
wanted
to
be
in
fact
what
his
father
was
only
in
name
to
succeed
where
magnus
had
failed
he
wanted
to
be
governor
of
the
state
he
had
put
his
teeth
together
and
deaf
to
all
other
considerations
blind
to
all
other
issues
he
worked
with
the
infinite
slowness
the
unshakable
tenacity
of
the
coral
insect
to
this
one
end
after
luncheon
was
over
lyman
ordered
cigars
and
liqueurs
and
with
the
three
others
returned
to
the
main
room
of
the
club
however
their
former
place
in
the
round
window
was
occupied
a
man
with
iron
grey
hair
and
moustache
who
wore
a
frock
coat
and
a
white
waistcoat
and
in
some
indefinable
manner
suggested
a
retired
naval
officer
was
sitting
at
their
table
smoking
a
long
thin
cigar
at
sight
of
him
presley
became
animated
he
uttered
a
mild
exclamation
why
is
that
cedarquist
cedarquist
repeated
lyman
derrick
i
know
him
well
yes
of
course
it
is
he
continued
governor
you
must
know
him
he
is
one
of
our
representative
men
you
would
enjoy
talking
to
him
he
was
the
head
of
the
big
atlas
iron
works
they
have
shut
down
recently
you
know
not
failed
exactly
but
just
ceased
to
be
a
paying
investment
and
cedarquist
closed
them
out
he
has
other
interests
though
he
a
rich
man
a
lyman
brought
the
group
up
to
the
gentleman
in
question
and
introduced
them
mr
magnus
derrick
of
course
observed
cedarquist
as
he
took
the
governor
hand
i
known
you
by
repute
for
some
time
sir
this
is
a
great
pleasure
i
assure
then
turning
to
presley
he
added
hello
pres
my
boy
how
is
the
great
the
very
great
poem
getting
on
it
not
getting
on
at
all
sir
answered
presley
in
some
embarrassment
as
they
all
sat
down
in
fact
i
about
given
up
the
idea
there
so
much
interest
in
what
you
might
call
down
at
los
muertos
now
that
i
getting
further
and
further
from
it
every
i
should
say
as
much
remarked
the
manufacturer
turning
towards
magnus
i
watching
your
fight
with
shelgrim
derrick
with
every
degree
of
he
raised
his
drink
of
whiskey
and
soda
success
to
as
he
replaced
his
glass
the
artist
hartrath
joined
the
group
uninvited
as
a
pretext
he
engaged
lyman
in
conversation
lyman
he
believed
was
a
man
with
a
pull
at
the
city
hall
in
connection
with
a
projected
fair
and
flower
festival
which
at
that
moment
was
the
talk
of
the
city
certain
statues
were
to
be
erected
and
hartrath
bespoke
lyman
influence
to
further
the
pretensions
of
a
sculptor
friend
of
his
who
wished
to
be
art
director
of
the
affair
in
the
matter
of
this
fair
and
flower
festival
hartrath
was
not
lacking
in
enthusiasm
he
addressed
the
others
with
extravagant
gestures
blinking
his
inflamed
eyelids
a
million
dollars
he
exclaimed
hey
think
of
that
why
do
you
know
that
we
have
five
hundred
thousand
practically
pledged
already
talk
about
public
spirit
gentlemen
this
is
the
most
city
on
the
continent
and
the
money
is
not
thrown
away
we
will
have
eastern
visitors
here
by
the
thousands
capitalists
men
with
money
to
invest
the
million
we
spend
on
our
fair
will
be
money
in
our
pockets
ah
you
should
see
how
the
women
of
this
city
are
taking
hold
of
the
matter
they
are
giving
all
kinds
of
little
entertainments
teas
tyme
singing
skules
amateur
theatricals
gingerbread
fetes
all
for
the
benefit
of
the
fund
and
the
business
men
too
pouring
out
their
money
like
water
it
is
splendid
splendid
to
see
a
community
so
the
manufacturer
cedarquist
fixed
the
artist
with
a
glance
of
melancholy
interest
and
how
much
he
remarked
will
they
contribute
your
gingerbread
women
and
capitalists
towards
the
blowing
up
of
the
ruins
of
the
atlas
iron
works
blowing
up
i
do
understand
murmured
the
artist
surprised
when
you
get
your
eastern
capitalists
out
here
with
your
fair
continued
cedarquist
you
do
propose
do
you
to
let
them
see
a
iron
foundry
standing
idle
because
of
the
indifference
of
san
francisco
business
men
they
might
ask
pertinent
questions
your
capitalists
and
we
should
have
to
answer
that
our
business
men
preferred
to
invest
their
money
in
corner
lots
and
government
bonds
rather
than
to
back
up
a
legitimate
industrial
enterprise
we
want
fairs
we
want
active
furnaces
we
do
want
public
statues
and
fountains
and
park
extensions
and
gingerbread
fetes
we
want
business
enterprise
is
it
like
us
is
it
like
us
he
exclaimed
sadly
what
a
melancholy
comment
san
francisco
it
is
not
a
city
it
is
a
midway
plaisance
california
likes
to
be
fooled
do
you
suppose
shelgrim
could
convert
the
whole
san
joaquin
valley
into
his
back
yard
otherwise
indifference
to
public
affairs
absolute
indifference
it
stamps
us
all
our
state
is
the
very
paradise
of
fakirs
you
and
your
fair
he
turned
to
hartrath
with
a
quiet
smile
it
is
just
such
men
as
you
hartrath
that
are
the
ruin
of
us
you
organise
a
sham
of
tinsel
and
pasteboard
put
on
fool
cap
and
bells
beat
a
gong
at
a
street
corner
and
the
crowd
cheers
you
and
drops
nickels
into
your
hat
your
fete
yes
i
saw
it
in
full
blast
the
other
night
on
the
grounds
of
one
of
your
women
places
on
sutter
street
i
was
on
my
way
home
from
the
last
board
meeting
of
the
atlas
company
a
gingerbread
fete
my
god
and
the
atlas
plant
shutting
down
for
want
of
financial
backing
a
million
dollars
spent
to
attract
the
eastern
investor
in
order
to
show
him
an
abandoned
rolling
mill
wherein
the
only
activity
is
the
sale
of
remnant
material
and
scrap
lyman
however
interfered
the
situation
was
becoming
strained
he
tried
to
conciliate
the
three
men
the
artist
the
manufacturer
and
the
farmer
the
warring
elements
but
hartrath
unwilling
to
face
the
enmity
that
he
felt
accumulating
against
him
took
himself
away
a
picture
of
his
a
study
of
the
contra
costa
was
to
be
raffled
in
the
club
rooms
for
the
benefit
of
the
fair
he
himself
was
in
charge
of
the
matter
he
disappeared
cedarquist
looked
after
him
with
contemplative
interest
then
turning
to
magnus
excused
himself
for
the
acridity
of
his
words
he
no
worse
than
many
others
and
the
people
of
this
state
and
city
are
after
all
only
a
little
more
than
other
it
was
his
favourite
topic
sure
of
the
interest
of
his
hearers
he
unburdened
himself
if
i
were
to
name
the
one
crying
evil
of
american
life
derrick
he
continued
it
would
be
the
indifference
of
the
better
people
to
public
affairs
it
is
so
in
all
our
great
centres
there
are
other
great
trusts
god
knows
in
the
united
states
besides
our
own
dear
and
railroad
every
state
has
its
own
grievance
if
it
is
not
a
railroad
trust
it
is
a
sugar
trust
or
an
oil
trust
or
an
industrial
trust
that
exploits
the
people
because
the
people
allow
it
the
indifference
of
the
people
is
the
opportunity
of
the
despot
it
is
as
true
as
that
the
whole
is
greater
than
the
part
and
the
maxim
is
so
old
that
it
is
trite
it
is
laughable
it
is
neglected
and
disused
for
the
sake
of
some
new
ingenious
and
complicated
theory
some
wonderful
scheme
of
reorganisation
but
the
fact
remains
nevertheless
simple
fundamental
everlasting
the
people
have
but
to
say
and
not
the
strongest
tyranny
political
religious
or
financial
that
was
ever
organised
could
survive
one
the
others
absorbed
attentive
approved
nodding
their
heads
in
silence
as
the
manufacturer
finished
that
one
reason
derrick
the
other
resumed
after
a
moment
why
i
have
been
so
glad
to
meet
you
you
and
your
league
are
trying
to
say
to
the
trust
i
hope
you
will
succeed
if
your
example
will
rally
the
people
to
your
cause
you
will
otherwise
he
shook
his
head
one
stage
of
the
fight
is
to
be
passed
this
very
day
observed
magnus
my
sons
and
myself
are
expecting
hourly
news
from
the
city
hall
a
decision
in
our
case
is
we
are
both
of
us
fighters
it
seems
derrick
said
cedarquist
each
with
his
particular
enemy
we
are
well
met
indeed
the
farmer
and
the
manufacturer
both
in
the
same
grist
between
the
two
millstones
of
the
lethargy
of
the
public
and
the
aggression
of
the
trust
the
two
great
evils
of
modern
america
pres
my
boy
there
is
your
epic
poem
ready
to
but
cedarquist
was
full
of
another
idea
rarely
did
so
favourable
an
opportunity
present
itself
for
explaining
his
theories
his
ambitions
addressing
himself
to
magnus
he
continued
fortunately
for
myself
the
atlas
company
was
not
my
only
investment
i
have
other
interests
the
building
of
ships
steel
sailing
ships
has
been
an
ambition
of
mine
for
this
purpose
derrick
to
carry
american
wheat
for
years
i
have
studied
this
question
of
american
wheat
and
at
last
i
have
arrived
at
a
theory
let
me
explain
at
present
all
our
california
wheat
goes
to
liverpool
and
from
that
port
is
distributed
over
the
world
but
a
change
is
coming
i
am
sure
of
it
you
young
men
he
turned
to
presley
lyman
and
harran
will
live
to
see
it
our
century
is
about
done
the
great
word
of
this
nineteenth
century
has
been
production
the
great
word
of
the
twentieth
century
will
be
listen
to
me
you
youngsters
markets
as
a
market
for
our
production
or
let
me
take
a
concrete
example
as
a
market
for
our
wheat
europe
is
played
out
population
in
europe
is
not
increasing
fast
enough
to
keep
up
with
the
rapidity
of
our
production
in
some
cases
as
in
france
the
population
is
stationary
we
however
have
gone
on
producing
wheat
at
a
tremendous
rate
the
result
is
we
supply
more
than
europe
can
eat
and
down
go
the
prices
the
remedy
is
not
in
the
curtailing
of
our
wheat
areas
but
in
this
we
must
have
new
markets
greater
markets
for
years
we
have
been
sending
our
wheat
from
east
to
west
from
california
to
europe
but
the
time
will
come
when
we
must
send
it
from
west
to
east
we
must
march
with
the
course
of
empire
not
against
it
i
mean
we
must
look
to
china
rice
in
china
is
losing
its
nutritive
quality
the
asiatics
though
must
be
fed
if
not
on
rice
then
on
wheat
why
derrick
if
only
the
population
of
china
ate
a
half
ounce
of
flour
per
man
per
day
all
the
wheat
areas
in
california
could
not
feed
them
ah
if
i
could
only
hammer
that
into
the
brains
of
every
rancher
of
the
san
joaquin
yes
and
of
every
owner
of
every
bonanza
farm
in
dakota
and
minnesota
send
your
wheat
to
china
handle
it
yourselves
do
away
with
the
middleman
break
up
the
chicago
wheat
pits
and
elevator
rings
and
mixing
houses
when
in
feeding
china
you
have
decreased
the
european
shipments
the
effect
is
instantaneous
prices
go
up
in
europe
without
having
the
least
effect
upon
the
prices
in
china
we
hold
the
key
we
have
the
wheat
infinitely
more
than
we
ourselves
can
eat
asia
and
europe
must
look
to
america
to
be
fed
what
fatuous
neglect
of
opportunity
to
continue
to
deluge
europe
with
our
surplus
food
when
the
east
trembles
upon
the
verge
of
starvation
the
two
men
cedarquist
and
magnus
continued
the
conversation
a
little
further
the
manufacturer
idea
was
new
to
the
governor
he
was
greatly
interested
he
withdrew
from
the
conversation
thoughtful
he
leaned
back
in
his
place
stroking
the
bridge
of
his
nose
with
a
crooked
forefinger
cedarquist
turned
to
harran
and
began
asking
details
as
to
the
conditions
of
the
wheat
growers
of
the
san
joaquin
lyman
still
maintained
an
attitude
of
polite
aloofness
yawning
occasionally
behind
three
fingers
and
presley
was
left
to
the
company
of
his
own
thoughts
there
had
been
a
day
when
the
affairs
and
grievances
of
the
farmers
of
his
acquaintance
magnus
annixter
osterman
and
old
broderson
had
filled
him
only
with
disgust
his
mind
full
of
a
great
vague
epic
poem
of
the
west
he
had
kept
himself
apart
disdainful
of
what
he
chose
to
consider
their
petty
squabbles
but
the
scene
in
annixter
harness
room
had
thrilled
and
uplifted
him
he
was
palpitating
with
excitement
all
through
the
succeeding
months
he
abandoned
the
idea
of
an
epic
poem
in
six
months
he
had
not
written
a
single
verse
day
after
day
he
trembled
with
excitement
as
the
relations
between
the
trust
and
league
became
more
and
more
strained
he
saw
the
matter
in
its
true
light
it
was
typical
it
was
the
war
between
freedom
and
tyranny
and
at
times
his
hatred
of
the
railroad
shook
him
like
a
crisp
and
withered
reed
while
the
languid
indifference
of
the
people
of
the
state
to
the
quarrel
filled
him
with
a
blind
exasperation
but
as
he
had
once
explained
to
vanamee
he
must
find
expression
he
felt
that
he
would
suffocate
otherwise
he
had
begun
to
keep
a
journal
as
the
inclination
spurred
him
he
wrote
down
his
thoughts
and
ideas
in
this
sometimes
every
day
sometimes
only
three
or
four
times
a
month
also
he
flung
aside
his
books
of
poems
milton
tennyson
browning
even
homer
and
addressed
himself
to
mill
malthus
young
poushkin
henry
george
schopenhauer
he
attacked
the
subject
of
social
inequality
with
unbounded
enthusiasm
he
devoured
rather
than
read
and
emerged
from
the
affair
his
mind
a
confused
jumble
of
conflicting
notions
sick
with
raging
against
injustice
and
oppression
and
with
not
one
sane
suggestion
as
to
remedy
or
redress
the
butt
of
his
cigarette
scorched
his
fingers
and
roused
him
from
his
brooding
in
the
act
of
lighting
another
he
glanced
across
the
room
and
was
surprised
to
see
two
very
prettily
dressed
young
women
in
the
company
of
an
older
gentleman
in
a
long
frock
coat
standing
before
hartrath
painting
examining
it
their
heads
upon
one
side
presley
uttered
a
murmur
of
surprise
he
himself
was
a
member
of
the
club
and
the
presence
of
women
within
its
doors
except
on
special
occasions
was
not
tolerated
he
turned
to
lyman
derrick
for
an
explanation
but
this
other
had
also
seen
the
women
and
abruptly
exclaimed
i
declare
i
had
forgotten
about
it
why
this
is
ladies
day
of
why
yes
interposed
cedarquist
glancing
at
the
women
over
his
shoulder
did
you
know
they
let
in
twice
a
year
you
remember
and
this
is
a
double
occasion
they
are
going
to
raffle
picture
for
the
benefit
of
the
gingerbread
fair
why
you
are
not
up
to
date
lyman
this
is
a
sacred
and
religious
rite
an
important
public
of
course
of
course
murmured
lyman
he
found
means
to
survey
harran
and
magnus
certainly
neither
his
father
nor
his
brother
were
dressed
for
the
function
that
impended
he
had
been
stupid
magnus
invariably
attracted
attention
and
now
with
his
trousers
strapped
under
his
boots
his
wrinkled
frock
coat
lyman
twisted
his
cuffs
into
sight
with
an
impatient
nervous
movement
of
his
wrists
glancing
a
second
time
at
his
brother
pink
face
forward
curling
yellow
hair
and
clothes
of
a
country
cut
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
he
wondered
what
were
the
club
regulations
in
the
matter
of
bringing
in
visitors
on
ladies
day
sure
enough
ladies
day
he
remarked
i
am
very
glad
you
struck
it
governor
we
can
sit
right
where
we
are
i
guess
this
is
as
good
a
place
as
any
to
see
the
crowd
it
a
good
chance
to
see
all
the
big
guns
of
the
city
do
you
expect
your
people
here
cedarquist
my
wife
may
come
and
my
daughters
said
the
manufacturer
ah
murmured
presley
so
much
the
better
i
was
going
to
give
myself
the
pleasure
of
calling
upon
your
daughters
cedarquist
this
you
can
save
your
carfare
pres
said
cedarquist
you
will
see
them
no
doubt
the
invitations
for
the
occasion
had
appointed
one
as
the
time
for
between
that
hour
and
two
the
guests
arrived
in
an
almost
unbroken
stream
from
their
point
of
vantage
in
the
round
window
of
the
main
room
magnus
his
two
sons
and
presley
looked
on
very
interested
cedarquist
had
excused
himself
affirming
that
he
must
look
out
for
his
women
folk
of
every
ten
of
the
arrivals
seven
at
least
were
ladies
they
entered
the
room
this
unfamiliar
masculine
haunt
where
their
husbands
brothers
and
sons
spent
so
much
of
their
time
with
a
certain
show
of
hesitancy
and
little
nervous
oblique
glances
moving
their
heads
from
side
to
side
like
a
file
of
hens
venturing
into
a
strange
barn
they
came
in
groups
ushered
by
a
single
member
of
the
club
doing
the
honours
with
effusive
bows
and
polite
gestures
indicating
the
various
objects
of
interest
pictures
busts
and
the
like
that
decorated
the
room
fresh
from
his
recollections
of
bonneville
guadalajara
and
the
dance
in
annixter
barn
presley
was
astonished
at
the
beauty
of
these
women
and
the
elegance
of
their
toilettes
the
crowd
thickened
rapidly
a
murmur
of
conversation
arose
subdued
gracious
mingled
with
the
soft
rustle
of
silk
grenadines
velvet
the
scent
of
delicate
perfumes
spread
in
the
air
violet
de
parme
peau
colours
of
the
most
harmonious
blends
appeared
and
disappeared
at
intervals
in
the
slowly
moving
press
touches
of
velvets
pale
violet
crepes
and
appliqued
laces
there
seemed
to
be
no
need
of
introductions
everybody
appeared
to
be
acquainted
there
was
no
awkwardness
no
constraint
the
assembly
disengaged
an
impression
of
refined
pleasure
on
every
hand
innumerable
dialogues
seemed
to
go
forward
easily
and
naturally
without
break
or
interruption
witty
engaging
the
couple
never
at
a
loss
for
repartee
a
third
party
was
gracefully
included
then
a
fourth
little
groups
were
formed
groups
that
divided
themselves
or
melted
into
other
groups
or
disintegrated
again
into
isolated
pairs
or
lost
themselves
in
the
background
of
the
mass
all
without
friction
without
embarrassment
the
whole
affair
going
forward
of
itself
decorous
tactful
at
a
distance
and
not
too
loud
a
stringed
orchestra
sent
up
a
pleasing
hum
waiters
with
brass
buttons
on
their
full
dress
coats
went
from
group
to
group
silent
unobtrusive
serving
salads
and
ices
but
the
focus
of
the
assembly
was
the
little
space
before
painting
it
was
called
a
study
of
the
contra
costa
foothills
and
was
set
in
a
frame
of
natural
redwood
the
bark
still
adhering
it
was
conspicuously
displayed
on
an
easel
at
the
right
of
the
entrance
to
the
main
room
of
the
club
and
was
very
large
in
the
foreground
and
to
the
left
under
the
shade
of
a
stood
a
couple
of
reddish
cows
in
a
patch
of
yellow
poppies
while
in
the
corner
to
balance
the
composition
was
placed
a
girl
in
a
pink
dress
and
white
sunbonnet
in
which
the
shadows
were
indicated
by
broad
dashes
of
pale
blue
paint
the
ladies
and
young
girls
examined
the
production
with
little
murmurs
of
admiration
hazarding
remembered
phrases
searching
for
the
exact
balance
between
generous
praise
and
critical
discrimination
expressing
their
opinions
in
the
mild
technicalities
of
the
art
books
and
painting
classes
they
spoke
of
atmospheric
effects
of
middle
distance
of
of
of
the
decomposition
of
light
of
the
subordination
of
individuality
to
fidelity
of
interpretation
one
tall
girl
with
hair
almost
white
in
its
blondness
having
observed
that
the
handling
of
the
masses
reminded
her
strongly
of
corot
her
companion
who
carried
a
gold
lorgnette
by
a
chain
around
her
neck
answered
ah
millet
perhaps
but
not
this
verdict
had
an
immediate
success
it
was
passed
from
group
to
group
it
seemed
to
imply
a
delicate
distinction
that
carried
conviction
at
once
it
was
decided
formally
that
the
reddish
brown
cows
in
the
picture
were
reminiscent
of
daubigny
and
that
the
handling
of
the
masses
was
altogether
millet
but
that
the
general
effect
was
not
quite
corot
presley
curious
to
see
the
painting
that
was
the
subject
of
so
much
discussion
had
left
the
group
in
the
round
window
and
stood
close
by
hartrath
craning
his
head
over
the
shoulders
of
the
crowd
trying
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
reddish
cows
the
and
the
blue
painted
foothills
he
was
suddenly
aware
of
cedarquist
voice
in
his
ear
and
turning
about
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
manufacturer
his
wife
and
his
two
daughters
there
was
a
meeting
salutations
were
exchanged
presley
shaking
hands
all
around
expressing
his
delight
at
seeing
his
old
friends
once
more
for
he
had
known
the
family
from
his
boyhood
cedarquist
being
his
aunt
cedarquist
and
her
two
daughters
declared
that
the
air
of
los
muertos
must
certainly
have
done
him
a
world
of
good
he
was
stouter
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
it
a
little
pale
perhaps
he
was
fatiguing
himself
with
his
writing
no
doubt
ah
he
must
take
care
health

everything
after
all

he
been

more

rapture

itself

as

when

festival
or

aroused
enthusiasm
in
all
quarters
the
occasion
was
one
of
gala
for
the
entire
fake
the
decayed
professors
virtuosi
litterateurs
and
artists
thronged
to
the
place
en
masse
their
clamour
filled
all
the
air
on
every
hand
one
heard
the
scraping
of
violins
the
tinkling
of
mandolins
the
suave
accents
of
art
talks
the
incoherencies
of
poets
the
declamation
of
elocutionists
the
inarticulate
wanderings
of
the
japanese
the
confused
mutterings
of
the
cherokee
the
guttural
bellowing
of
the
german
university
professor
all
in
the
name
of
the
fair
money
to
the
extent
of
hundreds
of
thousands
was
set
in
motion
cedarquist
was
busy
from
morning
until
night
one
after
another
she
was
introduced
to
newly
arrived
fakirs
to
each
poet
to
each
litterateur
to
each
professor
she
addressed
the
same
question
how
long
have
you
known
you
had
this
power
she
spent
her
days
in
one
quiver
of
excitement
and
jubilation
she
was
in
the
the
people
of
the
city
were
awakening
to
a
realisation
of
the
beautiful
to
a
sense
of
the
higher
needs
of
life
this
was
art
this
was
literature
this
was
culture
and
refinement
the
renaissance
had
appeared
in
the
west
she
was
a
short
rather
stout
very
much
little
woman
of
some
fifty
years
she
was
rich
in
her
own
name
even
before
her
marriage
being
a
relative
of
shelgrim
himself
and
on
familiar
terms
with
the
great
financier
and
his
family
her
husband
while
deploring
the
policy
of
the
railroad
saw
no
good
reason
for
quarrelling
with
shelgrim
and
on
more
than
one
occasion
had
dined
at
his
house
on
this
occasion
delighted
that
she
had
come
upon
a
minor
poet
she
insisted
upon
presenting
him
to
hartrath
you
two
should
have
so
much
in
common
she
explained
presley
shook
the
flaccid
hand
of
the
artist
murmuring
conventionalities
while
cedarquist
hastened
to
say
i
am
sure
you
know
presley
verse
hartrath
you
should
believe
me
you
two
have
much
in
common
i
can
see
so
much
that
is
alike
in
your
modes
of
interpreting
nature
in
presley
sonnet
better
part
there
is
the
same
note
as
in
your
picture
the
same
sincerity
of
tone
the
same
subtlety
of
touch
the
same
nuances
oh
my
dear
madame
murmured
the
artist
interrupting
impatient
retort
i
am
a
mere
bungler
you
do
mean
quite
that
i
am
sure
i
am
too
sensitive
it
is
my
cross
beauty
he
closed
his
sore
eyes
with
a
little
expression
of
pain
beauty
unmans
but
cedarquist
was
not
listening
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
artist
luxuriant
hair
a
thick
and
glossy
mane
that
all
but
covered
his
coat
collar
leonine
she
murmured
leonine
like
samson
of
however
abruptly
bestirring
herself
she
exclaimed
a
second
later
but
i
must
run
away
i
am
selling
tickets
for
you
this
afternoon
hartrath
i
am
having
such
success
already
presley
you
will
take
two
chances
i
am
sure
and
oh
by
the
way
i
have
such
good
news
you
know
i
am
one
of
the
lady
members
of
the
subscription
committee
for
our
fair
and
you
know
we
approached
shelgrim
for
a
donation
to
help
along
oh
such
a
liberal
patron
a
real
lorenzo
medici
in
the
name
of
the
pacific
and
southwestern
he
has
subscribed
think
of
it
five
thousand
dollars
and
yet
they
will
talk
of
the
meanness
of
the
possibly
it
is
to
his
interest
murmured
presley
the
fairs
and
festivals
bring
people
to
the
city
over
his
but
the
others
turned
on
him
expostulating
ah
you
philistine
declared
cedarquist
and
this
from
you
presley
to
attribute
such
base
motives
if
the
poets
become
materialised
presley
declared
hartrath
what
can
we
say
to
the
people
and
shelgrim
encourages
your
fairs
and
fetes
said
a
voice
at
presley
elbow
because
it
is
throwing
dust
in
the
the
group
turned
about
and
saw
cedarquist
who
had
come
up
unobserved
in
time
to
catch
the
drift
of
the
talk
but
he
spoke
without
bitterness
there
was
even
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
yes
he
continued
smiling
our
dear
shelgrim
promotes
your
fairs
not
only
as
pres
says
because
it
is
money
in
his
pocket
but
because
it
amuses
the
people
distracts
their
attention
from
the
doings
of
his
railroad
when
beatrice
was
a
baby
and
had
little
colics
i
used
to
jingle
my
keys
in
front
of
her
nose
and
it
took
her
attention
from
the
pain
in
her
tummy
so
the
others
laughed
protesting
nevertheless
and
cedarquist
shook
her
finger
in
warning
at
the
artist
and
exclaimed
the
philistines
be
upon
thee
samson
by
the
way
observed
hartrath
willing
to
change
the
subject
i
hear
you
are
on
the
famine
relief
committee
does
your
work
progress
oh
most
famously
i
assure
you
she
said
such
a
movement
as
we
have
started
those
poor
creatures
the
photographs
of
them
are
simply
dreadful
i
had
the
committee
to
luncheon
the
other
day
and
we
passed
them
around
we
are
getting
subscriptions
from
all
over
the
state
and
cedarquist
is
to
arrange
for
the
the
relief
committee
in
question
was
one
of
a
great
number
that
had
been
formed
in
california
and
all
over
the
union
for
the
matter
of
that
to
provide
relief
for
the
victims
of
a
great
famine
in
central
india
the
whole
world
had
been
struck
with
horror
at
the
reports
of
suffering
and
mortality
in
the
affected
districts
and
had
hastened
to
send
aid
certain
women
of
san
francisco
with
cedarquist
at
their
head
had
organised
a
number
of
committees
but
the
manufacturer
wife
turned
the
meetings
of
these
committees
into
social
affairs
luncheons
teas
where
one
discussed
the
ways
and
means
of
assisting
the
starving
asiatics
over
teacups
and
plates
of
salad
shortly
afterward
a
mild
commotion
spread
throughout
the
assemblage
of
the
club
guests
the
drawing
of
the
numbers
in
the
raffle
was
about
to
be
made
hartrath
in
a
flurry
of
agitation
excused
himself
cedarquist
took
presley
by
the
arm
pres
let
get
out
of
this
he
said
come
into
the
wine
room
and
i
will
shake
you
for
a
glass
of
they
had
some
difficulty
in
extricating
themselves
the
main
room
where
the
drawing
was
to
take
place
suddenly
became
densely
thronged
all
the
guests
pressed
eagerly
about
the
table
near
the
picture
upon
which
one
of
the
hall
boys
had
just
placed
a
ballot
box
containing
the
numbers
the
ladies
holding
their
tickets
in
their
hands
pushed
forward
a
staccato
chatter
of
excited
murmurs
arose
what
became
of
harran
and
lyman
and
the
governor
inquired
presley
lyman
had
disappeared
alleging
a
business
engagement
but
magnus
and
his
younger
son
had
retired
to
the
library
of
the
club
on
the
floor
above
it
was
almost
deserted
they
were
deep
in
earnest
conversation
harran
said
the
governor
with
decision
there
is
a
deal
there
in
what
cedarquist
says
our
wheat
to
china
hey
boy
it
is
certainly
worth
thinking
of
it
appeals
to
me
boy
it
appeals
to
me
it
big
and
there
a
fortune
in
it
big
chances
mean
big
returns
and
i
know
your
old
father
is
a
back
number
yet
harran
i
may
not
have
so
wide
an
outlook
as
our
friend
cedarquist
but
i
am
quick
to
see
my
chance
boy
the
whole
east
is
opening
disintegrating
before
the
it
is
time
that
bread
stuffs
as
well
should
make
markets
for
themselves
in
the
orient
just
at
this
moment
too
when
lyman
will
scale
down
freight
rates
so
we
can
haul
to
tidewater
at
little
magnus
paused
again
his
frown
beetling
and
in
the
silence
the
excited
murmur
from
the
main
room
of
the
club
the
soprano
chatter
of
a
multitude
of
women
found
its
way
to
the
deserted
library
i
believe
it
worth
looking
into
governor
asserted
harran
magnus
rose
and
his
hands
behind
him
paced
the
floor
of
the
library
a
couple
of
times
his
imagination
all
stimulated
and
vivid
the
great
gambler
perceived
his
chance
the
kaleidoscopic
shifting
of
circumstances
that
made
a
situation
it
had
come
silently
unexpectedly
he
had
not
seen
its
approach
abruptly
he
woke
one
morning
to
see
the
combination
realised
but
also
he
saw
a
vision
a
sudden
and
abrupt
revolution
in
the
wheat
a
new
world
of
markets
discovered
the
matter
as
important
as
the
discovery
of
america
the
torrent
of
wheat
was
to
be
diverted
flowing
back
upon
itself
in
a
sudden
colossal
eddy
stranding
the
middleman
the
the
men
dry
and
despairing
their
occupation
gone
he
saw
the
farmer
suddenly
emancipated
the
world
food
no
longer
at
the
mercy
of
the
speculator
thousands
upon
thousands
of
men
set
free
of
the
grip
of
trust
and
ring
and
monopoly
acting
for
themselves
selling
their
own
wheat
organising
into
one
gigantic
trust
themselves
sending
their
agents
to
all
the
entry
ports
of
china
himself
annixter
broderson
and
osterman
would
pool
their
issues
he
would
convince
them
of
the
magnificence
of
the
new
movement
they
would
be
its
pioneers
harran
would
be
sent
to
hong
kong
to
represent
the
four
they
would
charter
probably
buy
a
ship
perhaps
one
of
cedarquist
american
built
the
nation
flag
at
the
peak
and
the
sailing
of
that
ship
gorged
with
the
crops
from
broderson
and
osterman
ranches
from
quien
sabe
and
los
muertos
would
be
like
the
sailing
of
the
caravels
from
palos
it
would
mark
a
new
era
it
would
make
an
epoch
with
this
vision
still
expanding
before
the
eye
of
his
mind
magnus
with
harran
at
his
elbow
prepared
to
depart
they
descended
to
the
lower
floor
and
involved
themselves
for
a
moment
in
the
throng
of
fashionables
that
blocked
the
hallway
and
the
entrance
to
the
main
room
where
the
numbers
of
the
raffle
were
being
drawn
near
the
head
of
the
stairs
they
encountered
presley
and
cedarquist
who
had
just
come
out
of
the
wine
room
magnus
still
on
fire
with
the
new
idea
pressed
a
few
questions
upon
the
manufacturer
before
bidding
him
he
wished
to
talk
further
upon
the
great
subject
interested
as
to
details
but
cedarquist
was
vague
in
his
replies
he
was
no
farmer
he
hardly
knew
wheat
when
he
saw
it
only
he
knew
the
trend
of
the
world
affairs
he
felt
them
to
be
setting
inevitably
eastward
however
his
very
vagueness
was
a
further
inspiration
to
the
governor
he
swept
details
aside
he
saw
only
the
grand
coup
the
huge
results
the
east
conquered
the
march
of
empire
rolling
westward
finally
arriving
at
its
starting
point
the
vague
mysterious
orient
he
saw
his
wheat
like
the
crest
of
an
advancing
billow
crossing
the
pacific
bursting
upon
asia
flooding
the
orient
in
a
golden
torrent
it
was
the
new
era
he
had
lived
to
see
the
death
of
the
old
and
the
birth
of
the
new
first
the
mine
now
the
ranch
first
gold
now
wheat
once
again
he
became
the
pioneer
hardy
brilliant
taking
colossal
chances
blazing
the
way
grasping
a
fortune
a
million
in
a
single
day
all
the
bigness
of
his
nature
leaped
up
again
within
him
at
the
magnitude
of
the
inspiration
he
felt
young
again
indomitable
the
leader
at
last
king
of
his
fellows
wresting
from
fortune
at
this
eleventh
hour
before
his
old
age
the
place
of
high
command
which
so
long
had
been
denied
him
at
last
he
could
achieve
abruptly
magnus
was
aware
that
some
one
had
spoken
his
name
he
looked
about
and
saw
behind
him
at
a
little
distance
two
gentlemen
strangers
to
him
they
had
withdrawn
from
the
crowd
into
a
little
recess
evidently
having
no
women
to
look
after
they
had
lost
interest
in
the
afternoon
affair
magnus
realised
that
they
had
not
seen
him
one
of
them
was
reading
aloud
to
his
companion
from
an
evening
edition
of
that
day
newspaper
it
was
in
the
course
of
this
reading
that
magnus
caught
the
sound
of
his
name
he
paused
listening
and
presley
harran
and
cedarquist
followed
his
example
soon
they
all
understood
they
were
listening
to
the
report
of
the
judge
decision
for
which
magnus
was
waiting
the
decision
in
the
case
of
the
league
the
railroad
for
the
moment
the
polite
clamour
of
the
raffle
hushed
itself
the
winning
number
was
being
drawn
the
guests
held
their
breath
and
in
the
ensuing
silence
magnus
and
the
others
heard
these
words
distinctly
it
follows
that
the
title
to
the
lands
in
question
is
in
the
plaintiff
the
pacific
and
southwestern
railroad
and
the
defendants
have
no
title
and
their
possession
is
wrongful
there
must
be
findings
and
judgment
for
the
plaintiff
and
it
is
so
in
spite
of
himself
magnus
paled
harran
shut
his
teeth
with
an
oath
their
exaltation
of
the
previous
moment
collapsed
like
a
pyramid
of
cards
the
vision
of
the
new
movement
of
the
wheat
the
conquest
of
the
east
the
invasion
of
the
orient
seemed
only
the
flimsiest
mockery
with
a
brusque
wrench
they
were
snatched
back
to
reality
between
them
and
the
vision
between
the
fecund
san
joaquin
reeking
with
fruitfulness
and
the
millions
of
asia
crowding
toward
the
verge
of
starvation
lay
the
monster
of
steel
and
steam
implacable
insatiable
huge
its
entrails
gorged
with
the
life
blood
that
it
sucked
from
an
entire
commonwealth
its
ever
hungry
maw
glutted
with
the
harvests
that
should
have
fed
the
famished
bellies
of
the
whole
world
of
the
orient
but
abruptly
while
the
four
men
stood
there
gazing
into
each
faces
a
vigorous
broke
out
the
raffle
of
picture
was
over
and
as
presley
turned
about
he
saw
cedarquist
and
her
two
daughters
signalling
eagerly
to
the
manufacturer
unable
to
reach
him
because
of
the
intervening
crowd
then
cedarquist
raised
her
voice
and
cried
i
won
i
unnoticed
and
with
but
a
brief
word
to
cedarquist
magnus
and
harran
went
down
the
marble
steps
leading
to
the
street
door
silent
arm
tight
around
his
father
shoulder
at
once
the
orchestra
struck
into
a
lively
air
a
renewed
murmur
of
conversation
broke
out
and
cedarquist
as
he
said
to
presley
looked
first
at
the
retreating
figures
of
the
ranchers
then
at
the
gayly
dressed
throng
of
beautiful
women
and
debonair
young
men
and
indicating
the
whole
scene
with
a
single
gesture
said
smiling
sadly
as
he
spoke
not
a
city
presley
not
a
city
but
a
midway
chapter
ii
underneath
the
long
trestle
where
broderson
creek
cut
the
line
of
the
railroad
and
the
upper
road
the
ground
was
low
and
covered
with
a
second
growth
of
grey
green
willows
along
the
borders
of
the
creek
were
occasional
marshy
spots
and
now
and
then
hilma
tree
came
here
to
gather
which
she
made
into
salads
the
place
was
picturesque
secluded
an
oasis
of
green
shade
in
all
the
limitless
flat
monotony
of
the
surrounding
wheat
lands
the
creek
had
eroded
deep
into
the
little
gully
and
no
matter
how
hot
it
was
on
the
baking
shimmering
levels
of
the
ranches
above
down
here
one
always
found
one
self
enveloped
in
an
odorous
moist
coolness
from
time
to
time
the
incessant
murmur
of
the
creek
pouring
over
and
around
the
larger
stones
was
interrupted
by
the
thunder
of
trains
roaring
out
upon
the
trestle
overhead
passing
on
with
the
furious
gallop
of
their
hundreds
of
iron
wheels
leaving
in
the
air
a
taint
of
hot
oil
acrid
smoke
and
reek
of
escaping
steam
on
a
certain
afternoon
in
the
spring
of
the
year
hilma
was
returning
to
quien
sabe
from
hooven
by
the
trail
that
led
from
los
muertos
to
annixter
ranch
houses
under
the
trestle
she
had
spent
the
afternoon
with
minna
hooven
who
for
the
time
being
was
kept
indoors
because
of
a
wrenched
ankle
as
hilma
descended
into
the
gravel
flats
and
thickets
of
willows
underneath
the
trestle
she
decided
that
she
would
gather
some
cresses
for
her
supper
that
night
she
found
a
spot
around
the
base
of
one
of
the
supports
of
the
trestle
where
the
cresses
grew
thickest
and
plucked
a
couple
of
handfuls
washing
them
in
the
creek
and
pinning
them
up
in
her
handkerchief
it
made
a
little
round
cold
bundle
and
hilma
warm
from
her
walk
found
a
delicious
enjoyment
in
pressing
the
damp
ball
of
it
to
her
cheeks
and
neck
for
all
the
change
that
annixter
had
noted
in
her
upon
the
occasion
of
the
barn
dance
hilma
remained
in
many
things
a
young
child
she
was
never
at
loss
for
enjoyment
and
could
always
amuse
herself
when
left
alone
just
now
she
chose
to
drink
from
the
creek
lying
prone
on
the
ground
her
face
in
the
water
and
this
not
because
she
was
thirsty
but
because
it
was
a
new
way
to
drink
she
imagined
herself
a
belated
traveller
a
poor
girl
an
outcast
quenching
her
thirst
at
the
wayside
brook
her
little
packet
of
cresses
doing
duty
for
a
bundle
of
clothes
night
was
coming
on
perhaps
it
would
storm
she
had
nowhere
to
go
she
would
apply
at
a
hut
for
shelter
abruptly
the
temptation
to
dabble
her
feet
in
the
creek
presented
itself
to
her
always
she
had
liked
to
play
in
the
water
what
a
delight
now
to
take
off
her
shoes
and
stockings
and
wade
out
into
the
shallows
near
the
bank
she
had
worn
low
shoes
that
afternoon
and
the
dust
of
the
trail
had
filtered
in
above
the
edges
at
times
she
felt
the
grit
and
grey
sand
on
the
soles
of
her
feet
and
the
sensation
had
set
her
teeth
on
edge
what
a
delicious
alternative
the
cold
clean
water
suggested
and
how
easy
it
would
be
to
do
as
she
pleased
just
then
if
only
she
were
a
little
girl
in
the
end
it
was
stupid
to
be
grown
up
sitting
upon
the
bank
one
finger
tucked
into
the
heel
of
her
shoe
hilma
hesitated
suppose
a
train
should
come
she
fancied
she
could
see
the
engineer
leaning
from
the
cab
with
a
great
grin
on
his
face
or
the
brakeman
shouting
gibes
at
her
from
the
platform
abruptly
she
blushed
scarlet
the
blood
throbbed
in
her
temples
her
heart
beat
since
the
famous
evening
of
the
barn
dance
annixter
had
spoken
to
her
but
twice
hilma
no
longer
looked
after
the
ranch
house
these
days
the
thought
of
setting
foot
within
annixter
and
terrified
her
and
in
the
end
her
mother
had
taken
over
that
part
of
her
work
of
the
two
meetings
with
the
master
of
quien
sabe
one
had
been
a
mere
exchange
of
good
mornings
as
the
two
happened
to
meet
over
by
the
artesian
well
the
other
more
complicated
had
occurred
in
the
again
annixter
pretending
to
look
over
the
new
cheese
press
asking
about
details
of
her
work
when
this
had
happened
on
that
previous
occasion
ending
with
annixter
attempt
to
kiss
her
hilma
had
been
talkative
enough
chattering
on
from
one
subject
to
another
never
at
a
loss
for
a
theme
but
this
last
time
was
a
veritable
ordeal
no
sooner
had
annixter
appeared
than
her
heart
leaped
and
quivered
like
that
of
the
doe
her
speech
failed
her
throughout
the
whole
brief
interview
she
had
been
miserably
stammering
monosyllables
confused
horribly
awkward
and
when
annixter
had
gone
away
she
had
fled
to
her
little
room
and
bolting
the
door
had
flung
herself
face
downward
on
the
bed
and
wept
as
though
her
heart
were
breaking
she
did
not
know
why
that
annixter
had
been
overwhelmed
with
business
all
through
the
winter
was
an
inexpressible
relief
to
hilma
his
affairs
took
him
away
from
the
ranch
continually
he
was
absent
sometimes
for
weeks
making
trips
to
san
francisco
or
to
sacramento
or
to
bonneville
perhaps
he
was
forgetting
her
overlooking
her
and
while
at
first
she
told
herself
that
she
asked
nothing
better
the
idea
of
it
began
to
occupy
her
mind
she
began
to
wonder
if
it
was
really
so
she
knew
his
trouble
everybody
did
the
news
of
the
sudden
forward
movement
of
the
railroad
forces
inaugurating
the
campaign
had
flared
and
blazing
all
over
the
country
side
to
hilma
notion
annixter
attitude
was
heroic
beyond
all
expression
his
courage
in
facing
the
railroad
as
he
had
faced
delaney
in
the
barn
seemed
to
her
the
pitch
of
sublimity
she
refused
to
see
any
auxiliaries
aiding
him
in
his
fight
to
her
imagination
the
great
league
which
all
the
ranchers
were
joining
was
a
mere
form
annixter
fronted
the
monster
but
for
him
the
corporation
would
gobble
quien
sabe
as
a
whale
would
a
minnow
he
was
a
hero
who
stood
between
them
all
and
destruction
he
was
a
protector
of
her
family
he
was
her
champion
she
began
to
mention
him
in
her
prayers
every
night
adding
a
further
petition
to
the
effect
that
he
would
become
a
good
man
and
that
he
should
not
swear
so
much
and
that
he
should
never
meet
delaney
again
however
as
hilma
still
debated
the
idea
of
bathing
her
feet
in
the
creek
a
train
did
actually
thunder
past
overhead
the
regular
evening
overland
the
through
express
that
never
stopped
between
bakersfield
and
fresno
it
stormed
by
with
a
deafening
clamour
and
a
swirl
of
smoke
in
a
long
succession
of
and
chocolate
coloured
pullmans
grimy
with
the
dust
of
the
great
deserts
of
the
southwest
the
quivering
of
the
trestle
supports
set
a
tremble
in
the
ground
underfoot
the
thunder
of
wheels
drowned
all
sound
of
the
flowing
of
the
creek
and
also
the
noise
of
the
buckskin
mare
hoofs
descending
from
the
trail
upon
the
gravel
about
the
creek
so
that
hilma
turning
about
after
the
passage
of
the
train
saw
annixter
close
at
hand
with
the
abruptness
of
a
vision
he
was
looking
at
her
smiling
as
he
rarely
did
the
firm
line
of
his
lower
lip
relaxed
he
had
taken
off
his
campaign
hat
to
her
and
though
his
stiff
yellow
hair
was
twisted
into
a
bristling
mop
the
little
persistent
tuft
on
the
crown
usually
defiantly
erect
as
an
apache
was
nowhere
in
sight
hello
it
you
is
it
miss
hilma
he
exclaimed
getting
down
from
the
buckskin
and
allowing
her
to
drink
hilma
nodded
scrambling
to
her
feet
dusting
her
skirt
with
nervous
pats
of
both
hands
annixter
sat
down
on
a
great
rock
close
by
and
the
loop
of
the
bridle
over
his
arm
lit
a
cigar
and
began
to
talk
he
complained
of
the
heat
of
the
day
the
bad
condition
of
the
lower
road
over
which
he
had
come
on
his
way
from
a
committee
meeting
of
the
league
at
los
muertos
of
the
slowness
of
the
work
on
the
irrigating
ditch
and
as
a
matter
of
course
of
the
general
hard
times
miss
hilma
he
said
abruptly
never
you
marry
a
ranchman
he
never
out
of
hilma
gasped
her
eyes
widening
till
the
full
round
of
the
pupil
was
disclosed
instantly
a
certain
inexplicable
guiltiness
overpowered
her
with
incredible
confusion
her
hands
trembled
as
she
pressed
the
bundle
of
cresses
into
a
hard
ball
between
her
palms
annixter
continued
to
talk
he
was
disturbed
and
excited
himself
at
this
unexpected
meeting
never
through
all
the
past
winter
months
of
strenuous
activity
the
fever
of
political
campaigns
the
harrowing
delays
and
ultimate
defeat
in
one
law
court
after
another
had
he
forgotten
the
look
in
hilma
face
as
he
stood
with
one
arm
around
her
on
the
floor
of
his
barn
in
peril
of
his
life
from
the
revolver
that
dumb
confession
of
hilma
eyes
had
been
enough
for
him
yet
somehow
he
never
had
had
a
chance
to
act
upon
it
during
the
short
period
when
he
could
be
on
his
ranch
hilma
had
always
managed
to
avoid
him
once
even
she
had
spent
a
month
about
christmas
time
with
her
mother
father
who
kept
a
hotel
in
san
francisco
now
however
he
had
her
all
to
himself
he
would
put
an
end
to
the
situation
that
troubled
him
and
vexed
him
day
after
day
month
after
month
beyond
question
the
moment
had
come
for
something
definite
he
could
not
say
precisely
what
readjusting
his
cigar
between
his
teeth
he
resumed
his
speech
it
suited
his
humour
to
take
the
girl
into
his
confidence
following
an
instinct
which
warned
him
that
this
would
bring
about
a
certain
closeness
of
their
relations
a
certain
intimacy
what
do
you
think
of
this
row
anyways
miss
hilma
this
railroad
fuss
in
general
think
shelgrim
and
his
rushers
are
going
to
jump
quien
sabe
are
going
to
run
us
off
the
ranch
oh
no
sir
protested
hilma
still
breathless
oh
no
indeed
well
what
then
hilma
made
a
little
uncertain
movement
of
ignorance
i
do
know
well
the
league
agreed
that
if
the
test
cases
were
lost
in
the
supreme
court
you
know
we
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
at
washington
we
fight
yes
fight
like
like
you
and
delaney
that
time
with
oh
dear
with
guns
i
do
know
grumbled
annixter
vaguely
what
do
you
think
hilma
almost
husky
voice
trembled
a
little
as
she
replied
fighting
with
guns
that
so
terrible
oh
those
revolvers
in
the
barn
i
can
hear
them
yet
every
shot
seemed
like
the
explosion
of
tons
of
shall
we
clear
out
then
shall
we
let
delaney
have
possession
and
behrman
and
all
that
lot
shall
we
give
in
to
them
never
never
she
exclaimed
her
great
eyes
flashing
you
would
like
to
be
turned
out
of
your
home
would
you
miss
hilma
because
quien
sabe
is
your
home
is
it
you
lived
here
ever
since
you
were
as
big
as
a
minute
you
would
like
to
have
behrman
and
the
rest
of
turn
you
out
she
murmured
no
i
should
like
that
there
mamma
and
well
do
you
think
for
one
second
i
going
to
let
cried
annixter
his
teeth
tightening
on
his
cigar
you
stay
right
where
you
are
i
take
care
of
you
right
enough
look
here
he
demanded
abruptly
you
no
use
for
that
roaring
lush
delaney
have
you
i
think
he
is
a
wicked
man
she
declared
i
know
the
railroad
has
pretended
to
sell
him
part
of
the
ranch
and
he
lets
behrman
and
ruggles
just
use
right
i
thought
you
would
be
keen
on
there
was
a
long
pause
the
buckskin
began
blowing
among
the
pebbles
nosing
for
grass
and
annixter
shifted
his
cigar
to
the
other
corner
of
his
mouth
pretty
place
he
muttered
looking
around
him
then
he
added
miss
hilma
see
here
i
want
to
have
a
kind
of
talk
with
you
if
you
mind
i
do
know
just
how
to
say
these
sort
of
things
and
if
i
get
all
balled
up
as
i
go
along
you
just
set
it
down
to
the
fact
that
never
had
any
experience
in
dealing
with
feemale
girls
understand
you
see
ever
since
the
barn
dance
yes
and
long
before
then
i
been
thinking
a
lot
about
you
straight
i
have
and
i
guess
you
know
it
you
about
the
only
girl
that
i
ever
knew
well
and
i
guess
he
declared
deliberately
you
about
the
only
one
i
want
to
know
it
my
nature
you
did
say
anything
that
time
when
we
stood
there
together
and
delaney
was
playing
the
fool
but
somehow
i
got
the
idea
that
you
did
want
delaney
to
do
for
me
one
little
bit
that
if
got
me
then
you
would
have
been
sorrier
than
if
he
got
any
one
else
well
i
felt
just
that
way
about
you
i
would
rather
have
had
him
shoot
any
other
girl
in
the
room
than
you
yes
or
in
the
whole
state
why
if
anything
should
happen
to
you
miss
hilma
well
i
would
care
to
go
on
with
anything
behrman
could
jump
quien
sabe
and
welcome
and
delaney
could
shoot
me
full
of
holes
whenever
he
got
good
and
ready
i
quit
i
lay
right
down
i
would
care
a
whoop
about
anything
any
more
you
are
the
only
girl
for
me
in
the
whole
world
i
did
think
so
at
first
i
did
want
to
but
seeing
you
around
every
day
and
seeing
how
pretty
you
were
and
how
clever
and
hearing
your
voice
and
all
why
it
just
got
all
inside
of
me
somehow
and
now
i
ca
think
of
anything
else
i
hate
to
go
to
san
francisco
or
sacramento
or
visalia
or
even
bonneville
for
only
a
day
just
because
you
are
there
in
any
of
those
places
and
i
just
rush
what
i
got
to
do
so
as
i
can
get
back
here
while
you
were
away
that
christmas
time
why
i
was
as
lonesome
as
oh
you
do
know
anything
about
it
i
just
scratched
off
the
days
on
the
calendar
every
night
one
by
one
till
you
got
back
and
it
just
comes
to
this
i
want
you
with
me
all
the
time
i
want
you
should
have
a
home
that
my
home
too
i
want
to
take
care
of
you
and
have
you
all
for
myself
you
understand
what
do
you
say
hilma
standing
up
before
him
retied
a
knot
in
her
handkerchief
bundle
with
elaborate
precaution
blinking
at
it
through
her
tears
what
do
you
say
miss
hilma
annixter
repeated
how
about
that
what
do
you
say
just
above
a
whisper
hilma
murmured
i
i
do
do
know
what
do
you
think
we
could
hit
it
off
together
i
do
i
know
we
could
hilma
i
do
mean
to
scare
you
what
are
you
crying
for
i
do
annixter
got
up
cast
away
his
cigar
and
dropping
the
bridle
came
and
stood
beside
her
putting
a
hand
on
her
shoulder
hilma
did
not
move
and
he
felt
her
trembling
she
still
plucked
at
the
knot
of
the
handkerchief
i
ca
do
without
you
little
girl
annixter
continued
and
i
want
you
i
want
you
bad
i
do
get
much
fun
out
of
life
ever
it
sure
is
my
nature
i
guess
i
a
hard
man
everybody
is
trying
to
down
me
and
now
i
up
against
the
railroad
i
fighting
all
hilma
night
and
day
lock
stock
and
barrel
and
i
fighting
now
for
my
home
my
land
everything
i
have
in
the
world
if
i
win
out
i
want
somebody
to
be
glad
with
me
if
i
do
i
want
somebody
to
be
sorry
for
me
sorry
with
me
and
that
somebody
is
you
i
am
of
going
it
alone
i
want
some
one
to
back
me
up
i
want
to
feel
you
alongside
of
me
to
give
me
a
touch
of
the
shoulder
now
and
then
tired
of
fighting
for
things
land
property
money
i
want
to
fight
for
some
person
somebody
beside
myself
understand
want
to
feel
that
it
is
all
selfishness
that
there
are
other
interests
than
mine
in
the
game
that
there
some
one
dependent
on
me
and
that
thinking
of
me
as
i
thinking
of
them
some
one
i
can
come
home
to
at
night
and
put
my
arm
around
like
this
and
have
her
put
her
two
arms
around
me
like
he
paused
a
second
and
once
again
as
it
had
been
in
that
moment
of
imminent
peril
when
he
stood
with
his
arm
around
her
their
eyes
met
put
her
two
arms
around
me
prompted
annixter
half
smiling
like
like
what
hilma
i
do
like
what
hilma
he
insisted
like
like
this
she
questioned
with
a
movement
of
infinite
tenderness
and
affection
she
slid
her
arms
around
his
neck
still
crying
a
little
the
sensation
of
her
warm
body
in
his
embrace
the
feeling
of
her
smooth
round
arm
through
the
thinness
of
her
sleeve
pressing
against
his
cheek
thrilled
annixter
with
a
delight
such
as
he
had
never
known
he
bent
his
head
and
kissed
her
upon
the
nape
of
her
neck
where
the
delicate
amber
tint
melted
into
the
thick
sweet
smelling
mass
of
her
dark
brown
hair
she
shivered
a
little
holding
him
closer
ashamed
as
yet
to
look
up
without
speech
they
stood
there
for
a
long
minute
holding
each
other
close
then
hilma
pulled
away
from
him
mopping
her
cheeks
with
the
little
moist
ball
of
her
handkerchief
what
do
you
say
is
it
a
go
demanded
annixter
jovially
i
thought
i
hated
you
all
the
time
she
said
and
the
velvety
huskiness
of
her
voice
never
sounded
so
sweet
to
him
and
i
thought
it
was
that
crockery
smashing
goat
of
a
lout
of
a
delaney
the
idea
oh
dear
i
think
it
must
always
have
been
since
when
hilma
he
asked
putting
his
arm
around
her
ah
but
it
is
good
to
have
you
my
girl
he
exclaimed
delighted
beyond
words
that
she
permitted
this
freedom
since
when
tell
us
all
about
oh
since
always
it
was
ever
so
long
before
i
came
to
think
of
you
to
well
to
think
about
i
mean
to
remember
oh
you
know
what
i
mean
but
when
i
did
oh
then
then
what
i
do
know
i
have
thought
that
way
long
enough
to
but
you
said
you
thought
it
must
have
been
me
i
know
but
that
was
different
oh
i
all
mixed
up
i
so
nervous
and
trembly
now
oh
she
cried
suddenly
her
face
overcast
with
a
look
of
earnestness
and
great
seriousness
both
her
hands
catching
at
his
wrist
oh
you
will
be
good
to
me
now
wo
you
i
only
a
little
little
child
in
so
many
ways
and
i
given
myself
to
you
all
in
a
minute
and
i
ca
go
back
of
it
now
and
it
for
always
i
do
know
how
it
happened
or
why
sometimes
i
think
i
did
wish
it
but
now
done
and
i
am
glad
and
happy
but
now
if
you
were
good
to
me
oh
think
of
how
it
would
be
with
me
you
are
strong
and
big
and
rich
and
i
am
only
a
servant
of
yours
a
little
nobody
but
i
given
all
i
had
to
you
myself
and
you
must
be
so
good
to
me
now
always
remember
that
be
good
to
me
and
be
gentle
and
kind
to
me
in
little
things
in
everything
or
you
will
break
my
annixter
took
her
in
his
arms
he
was
speechless
no
words
that
he
had
at
his
command
seemed
adequate
all
he
could
say
was
that
all
right
little
girl
do
you
be
frightened
i
take
care
of
you
that
all
right
that
all
for
a
long
time
they
sat
there
under
the
shade
of
the
great
trestle
their
arms
about
each
other
speaking
only
at
intervals
an
hour
passed
the
buckskin
finding
no
feed
to
her
taste
took
the
trail
stablewards
the
bridle
dragging
annixter
let
her
go
rather
than
to
take
his
arm
from
around
hilma
waist
he
would
have
lost
his
whole
stable
at
last
however
he
bestirred
himself
and
began
to
talk
he
thought
it
time
to
formulate
some
plan
of
action
well
now
hilma
what
are
we
going
to
do
do
she
repeated
why
must
we
do
anything
oh
is
this
enough
there
better
ahead
he
went
on
i
want
to
fix
you
up
somewhere
where
you
can
have
a
bit
of
a
home
all
to
yourself
let
see
bonneville
would
do
there
always
a
lot
of
yaps
about
there
that
know
us
and
they
would
begin
to
cackle
first
off
how
about
san
francisco
we
might
go
up
next
week
and
have
a
look
around
i
would
find
rooms
you
could
take
somewheres
and
we
would
fix
up
as
lovely
as
oh
but
why
go
away
from
quien
sabe
she
protested
and
then
so
soon
too
why
must
we
have
a
wedding
trip
now
that
you
are
so
busy
would
it
be
better
oh
i
tell
you
we
could
go
to
monterey
after
we
were
married
for
a
little
week
where
mamma
people
live
and
then
come
back
here
to
the
ranch
house
and
settle
right
down
where
we
are
and
let
me
keep
house
for
you
i
would
even
want
a
single
annixter
heard
and
his
face
grew
troubled
hum
he
said
i
he
gathered
up
a
handful
of
pebbles
and
began
snapping
them
carefully
into
the
creek
he
fell
thoughtful
here
was
a
phase
of
the
affair
he
had
not
planned
in
the
least
he
had
supposed
all
the
time
that
hilma
took
his
meaning
his
old
suspicion
that
she
was
trying
to
get
a
hold
on
him
stirred
again
for
a
moment
there
was
no
good
of
such
talk
as
that
always
these
feemale
girls
seemed
crazy
to
get
married
bent
on
complicating
the
situation
is
that
best
said
hilma
glancing
at
him
i
do
know
he
muttered
gloomily
well
then
let
not
let
come
right
back
to
quien
sabe
without
going
to
monterey
anything
that
you
want
i
i
had
thought
of
it
in
just
that
way
he
observed
in
what
way
then
ca
we
ca
we
wait
about
this
marrying
business
that
just
it
she
said
gayly
i
said
it
was
too
soon
there
would
be
so
much
to
do
between
whiles
why
not
say
at
the
end
of
the
summer
say
what
our
marriage
i
why
get
married
then
what
the
good
of
all
that
fuss
about
it
i
do
go
anything
upon
a
minister
puddling
round
in
my
affairs
the
difference
anyhow
we
understand
each
other
is
that
enough
pshaw
hilma
i
no
marrying
she
looked
at
him
a
moment
bewildered
then
slowly
she
took
his
meaning
she
rose
to
her
feet
her
eyes
wide
her
face
paling
with
terror
he
did
not
look
at
her
but
he
could
hear
the
catch
in
her
throat
oh
she
exclaimed
with
a
long
deep
breath
and
again
oh
the
back
of
her
hand
against
her
lips
it
was
a
quick
gasp
of
a
veritable
physical
anguish
her
eyes
brimmed
over
annixter
rose
looking
at
her
well
he
said
awkwardly
well
hilma
leaped
back
from
him
with
an
instinctive
recoil
of
her
whole
being
throwing
out
her
hands
in
a
gesture
of
defence
fearing
she
knew
not
what
there
was
as
yet
no
sense
of
insult
in
her
mind
no
outraged
modesty
she
was
only
terrified
it
was
as
though
searching
for
wild
flowers
she
had
come
suddenly
upon
a
snake
she
stood
for
an
instant
spellbound
her
eyes
wide
her
bosom
swelling
then
all
at
once
turned
and
fled
darting
across
the
plank
that
served
for
a
foot
bridge
over
the
creek
gaining
the
opposite
bank
and
disappearing
with
a
brisk
rustle
of
underbrush
such
as
might
have
been
made
by
the
flight
of
a
frightened
fawn
abruptly
annixter
found
himself
alone
for
a
moment
he
did
not
move
then
he
picked
up
his
campaign
hat
carefully
creased
its
limp
crown
and
put
it
on
his
head
and
stood
for
a
moment
looking
vaguely
at
the
ground
on
both
sides
of
him
he
went
away
without
uttering
a
word
without
change
of
countenance
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
feet
taking
great
strides
along
the
trail
in
the
direction
of
the
ranch
house
he
had
no
sight
of
hilma
again
that
evening
and
the
next
morning
he
was
up
early
and
did
not
breakfast
at
the
ranch
house
business
of
the
league
called
him
to
bonneville
to
confer
with
magnus
and
the
firm
of
lawyers
retained
by
the
league
to
fight
the
cases
an
appeal
was
to
be
taken
to
the
supreme
court
at
washington
and
it
was
to
be
settled
that
day
which
of
the
cases
involved
should
be
considered
as
test
cases
instead
of
driving
or
riding
into
bonneville
as
he
usually
did
annixter
took
an
early
morning
train
the
local
at
guadalajara
and
went
to
bonneville
by
rail
arriving
there
at
twenty
minutes
after
seven
and
breakfasting
by
appointment
with
magnus
derrick
and
osterman
at
the
yosemite
house
on
main
street
the
conference
of
the
committee
with
the
lawyers
took
place
in
a
front
room
of
the
yosemite
one
of
the
latter
bringing
with
him
his
clerk
who
made
a
stenographic
report
of
the
proceedings
and
took
carbon
copies
of
all
letters
written
the
conference
was
long
and
complicated
the
business
transacted
of
the
utmost
moment
and
it
was
not
until
two
that
annixter
found
himself
at
liberty
however
as
he
and
magnus
descended
into
the
lobby
of
the
hotel
they
were
aware
of
an
excited
and
interested
group
collected
about
the
swing
doors
that
opened
from
the
lobby
of
the
yosemite
into
the
bar
of
the
same
name
dyke
was
there
even
at
a
distance
they
could
hear
the
reverberation
of
his
voice
uplifted
in
wrath
and
furious
expostulation
magnus
and
annixter
joined
the
group
wondering
and
all
at
once
fell
full
upon
the
first
scene
of
a
drama
that
same
morning
dyke
mother
had
awakened
him
according
to
his
instructions
at
daybreak
a
consignment
of
his
hop
poles
from
the
north
had
arrived
at
the
freight
office
of
the
and
in
bonneville
and
he
was
to
drive
in
on
his
farm
wagon
and
bring
them
out
he
would
have
a
busy
day
hello
hello
he
said
as
his
mother
pulled
his
ear
to
arouse
him
morning
it
time
she
said
after
five
already
your
breakfast
is
on
the
he
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
with
great
affection
he
loved
his
mother
devotedly
quite
as
much
as
he
did
the
little
tad
in
their
little
cottage
in
the
forest
of
green
hops
that
surrounded
them
on
every
hand
the
three
led
a
joyous
and
secluded
life
contented
industrious
happy
asking
nothing
better
dyke
himself
was
a
jovial
man
who
spread
an
atmosphere
of
wherever
he
went
in
the
evenings
he
played
with
sidney
like
a
big
boy
an
older
brother
lying
on
the
bed
or
the
sofa
taking
her
in
his
arms
between
them
they
had
invented
a
great
game
the
his
boots
removed
his
huge
legs
in
the
air
hoisted
the
little
tad
on
the
soles
of
his
stockinged
feet
like
a
circus
acrobat
dandling
her
there
pretending
he
was
about
to
let
her
fall
sidney
choking
with
delight
held
on
nervously
with
little
screams
and
chirps
of
excitement
while
he
shifted
her
gingerly
from
one
foot
to
another
and
thence
the
final
act
the
great
gallery
play
to
the
palm
of
one
great
hand
at
this
point
dyke
was
called
in
both
father
and
daughter
children
both
crying
out
that
she
was
to
come
in
and
look
look
she
arrived
out
of
breath
from
the
kitchen
the
potato
masher
in
her
hand
such
children
she
murmured
shaking
her
head
at
them
amused
for
all
that
tucking
the
potato
masher
under
her
arm
and
clapping
her
hands
in
the
end
it
was
part
of
the
game
that
sidney
should
tumble
down
upon
dyke
whereat
he
invariably
vented
a
great
bellow
as
if
in
pain
declaring
that
his
ribs
were
broken
gasping
his
eyes
shut
he
pretended
to
be
in
the
extreme
of
dissolution
perhaps
he
was
dying
sidney
always
a
little
uncertain
amused
but
distressed
shook
him
nervously
tugging
at
his
beard
pushing
open
his
eyelid
with
one
finger
imploring
him
not
to
frighten
her
to
wake
up
and
be
good
on
this
occasion
while
yet
he
was
dyke
tiptoed
into
his
mother
room
to
look
at
sidney
fast
asleep
in
her
little
iron
cot
her
arm
under
her
head
her
lips
parted
with
infinite
precaution
he
kissed
her
twice
and
then
finding
one
little
stocking
hung
with
its
mate
very
neatly
over
the
back
of
a
chair
dropped
into
it
a
dime
rolled
up
in
a
wad
of
paper
he
winked
all
to
himself
and
went
out
again
closing
the
door
with
exaggerated
carefulness
he
breakfasted
alone
dyke
pouring
his
coffee
and
handing
him
his
plate
of
ham
and
eggs
and
half
an
hour
later
took
himself
off
in
his
springless
skeleton
wagon
humming
a
tune
behind
his
beard
and
cracking
the
whip
over
the
backs
of
his
staid
and
solid
farm
horses
the
morning
was
fine
the
sun
just
coming
up
he
left
guadalajara
sleeping
and
lifeless
on
his
left
and
going
across
lots
over
an
angle
of
quien
sabe
came
out
upon
the
upper
road
a
mile
below
the
long
trestle
he
was
in
great
spirits
looking
about
him
over
the
brown
fields
ruddy
with
the
dawn
almost
directly
in
front
of
him
but
far
off
the
gilded
dome
of
the
at
bonneville
was
glinting
radiant
in
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
while
a
few
miles
distant
toward
the
north
the
venerable
campanile
of
the
mission
san
juan
stood
silhouetted
in
purplish
black
against
the
flaming
east
as
he
proceeded
the
great
farm
horses
jogging
forward
placid
deliberate
the
country
side
waked
to
another
day
crossing
the
irrigating
ditch
further
on
he
met
a
gang
of
portuguese
with
picks
and
shovels
over
their
shoulders
just
going
to
work
hooven
already
abroad
shouted
him
a
goot
mornun
from
behind
the
fence
of
los
muertos
far
off
toward
the
southwest
in
the
bare
expanse
of
the
open
fields
where
a
clump
of
eucalyptus
and
cypress
trees
set
a
dark
green
note
a
thin
stream
of
smoke
rose
straight
into
the
air
from
the
kitchen
of
derrick
ranch
houses
but
a
mile
or
so
beyond
the
long
trestle
he
was
surprised
to
see
magnus
derrick
protege
the
shepherd
vanamee
coming
across
quien
sabe
by
a
trail
from
one
of
annixter
division
houses
without
knowing
exactly
why
dyke
received
the
impression
that
the
young
man
had
not
been
in
bed
all
of
that
night
as
the
two
approached
each
other
dyke
eyed
the
young
fellow
he
was
distrustful
of
vanamee
having
the
suspicion
of
any
person
he
could
not
understand
vanamee
was
beyond
doubt
no
part
of
the
life
of
ranch
and
country
town
he
was
an
alien
a
vagabond
a
strange
fellow
who
came
and
went
in
mysterious
fashion
making
no
friends
keeping
to
himself
why
did
he
never
wear
a
hat
why
indulge
in
a
fine
black
pointed
beard
when
either
a
round
beard
or
a
mustache
was
the
invariable
custom
why
did
he
not
cut
his
hair
above
all
why
did
he
prowl
about
so
much
at
night
as
the
two
passed
each
other
dyke
for
all
his
was
a
little
blunt
in
his
greeting
and
looked
back
at
the
over
his
shoulder
dyke
was
right
in
his
suspicion
vanamee
bed
had
not
been
disturbed
for
three
nights
on
the
monday
of
that
week
he
had
passed
the
entire
night
in
the
garden
of
the
mission
overlooking
the
seed
ranch
in
the
little
valley
tuesday
evening
had
found
him
miles
away
from
that
spot
in
a
deep
arroyo
in
the
sierra
foothills
to
the
eastward
while
wednesday
he
had
slept
in
an
abandoned
on
osterman
stock
range
twenty
miles
from
his
resting
place
of
the
night
before
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
that
the
old
restlessness
had
once
more
seized
upon
vanamee
something
began
tugging
at
him
the
spur
of
some
unseen
rider
touched
his
flank
the
instinct
of
the
wanderer
woke
and
moved
for
some
time
now
he
had
been
a
part
of
the
los
muertos
staff
on
quien
sabe
as
on
the
other
ranches
the
slack
season
was
at
hand
while
waiting
for
the
wheat
to
come
up
no
one
was
doing
much
of
anything
vanamee
had
come
over
to
los
muertos
and
spent
most
of
his
days
on
horseback
riding
the
range
rounding
up
and
watching
the
cattle
in
the
fourth
division
of
the
ranch
but
if
the
vagabond
instinct
now
roused
itself
in
the
strange
fellow
nature
a
counter
influence
had
also
set
in
more
and
more
vanamee
frequented
the
mission
garden
after
nightfall
sometimes
remaining
there
till
the
dawn
began
to
whiten
lying
prone
on
the
ground
his
chin
on
his
folded
arms
his
eyes
searching
the
darkness
over
the
little
valley
of
the
seed
ranch
watching
watching
as
the
days
went
by
he
became
more
reticent
than
ever
presley
often
came
to
find
him
on
the
stock
range
a
lonely
figure
in
the
great
wilderness
of
bare
green
hillsides
but
vanamee
no
longer
took
him
into
his
confidence
father
sarria
alone
heard
his
strange
stories
dyke
drove
on
toward
bonneville
thinking
over
the
whole
matter
he
knew
as
every
one
did
in
that
part
of
the
country
the
legend
of
vanamee
and
angele
the
romance
of
the
mission
garden
the
mystery
of
the
other
vanamee
flight
to
the
deserts
of
the
southwest
his
periodic
returns
his
strange
reticent
solitary
character
but
like
many
another
of
the
country
people
he
accounted
for
vanamee
by
a
short
and
easy
method
no
doubt
the
fellow
wits
were
turned
that
was
the
long
and
short
of
it
the
reached
the
post
office
in
bonneville
towards
eleven
but
he
did
not
at
once
present
his
notice
of
the
arrival
of
his
consignment
at
ruggles
office
it
entertained
him
to
indulge
in
an
hour
lounging
about
the
streets
it
was
seldom
he
got
into
town
and
when
he
did
he
permitted
himself
the
luxury
of
enjoying
his
evident
popularity
he
met
friends
everywhere
in
the
post
office
in
the
drug
store
in
the
barber
shop
and
around
the
with
each
one
he
held
a
moment
conversation
almost
invariably
this
ended
in
the
same
way
come
on
have
a
well
i
do
care
if
i
and
the
friends
proceeded
to
the
yosemite
bar
pledging
each
other
with
punctilious
ceremony
dyke
however
was
a
strictly
temperate
man
his
life
on
the
engine
had
trained
him
well
alcohol
he
never
touched
drinking
instead
ginger
ale
soft
drinks
at
the
drug
store
which
also
kept
a
stock
of
miscellaneous
stationery
his
eye
was
caught
by
a
transparent
slate
a
child
toy
where
upon
a
little
pane
of
frosted
glass
one
could
trace
with
considerable
elaboration
outline
figures
of
cows
ploughs
bunches
of
fruit
and
even
rural
water
mills
that
were
printed
on
slips
of
paper
underneath
now
there
an
idea
jim
he
observed
to
the
boy

the

by
george
in
about
five
years
time
i
have
things
humming
i
going
to
make
money
he
emerged
once
more
into
the
street
and
went
up
the
block
leisurely
planting
his
feet
squarely
he
fancied
that
he
could
feel
he
was
considered
of
more
importance
nowadays
he
was
no
longer
a
subordinate
an
employee
he
was
his
own
man
a
proprietor
an
owner
of
land
furthering
a
successful
enterprise
no
one
had
helped
him
he
had
followed
no
one
lead
he
had
struck
out
unaided
for
himself
and
his
success
was
due
solely
to
his
own
intelligence
industry
and
foresight
he
squared
his
great
shoulders
till
the
blue
gingham
of
his
jumper
all
but
cracked
of
late
his
great
blond
beard
had
grown
and
the
work
in
the
sun
had
made
his
face
very
red
under
the
visor
of
his
cap
relic
of
his
engineering
days
his
blue
eyes
twinkled
with
vast
he
felt
that
he
made
a
fine
figure
as
he
went
by
a
group
of
young
girls
in
lawns
and
muslins
and
garden
hats
on
their
way
to
the
post
office
he
wondered
if
they
looked
after
him
wondered
if
they
had
heard
that
he
was
in
a
fair
way
to
become
a
rich
man
but
the
chronometer
in
the
window
of
the
jewelry
store
warned
him
that
time
was
passing
he
turned
about
and
crossing
the
street
took
his
way
to
ruggles
office
which
was
the
freight
as
well
as
the
land
office
of
the
and
railroad
as
he
stood
for
a
moment
at
the
counter
in
front
of
the
wire
partition
waiting
for
the
clerk
to
make
out
the
order
for
the
freight
agent
at
the
depot
dyke
was
surprised
to
see
a
familiar
figure
in
conference
with
ruggles
himself
by
a
desk
inside
the
railing
the
figure
was
that
of
a
man
fat
with
a
great
stomach
which
he
stroked
from
time
to
time
as
he
turned
about
addressing
a
remark
to
the
clerk
dyke
recognised
behrman
the
banker
railroad
agent
and
political
manipulator
seemed
to
the
eyes
to
be
more
gross
than
ever
his
jowl
stood
out
big
and
tremulous
on
either
side
of
his
face
the
roll
of
fat
on
the
nape
of
his
neck
sprinkled
with
sparse
stiff
hairs
bulged
out
with
greater
prominence
his
great
stomach
covered
with
a
light
brown
linen
vest
stamped
with
innumerable
interlocked
horseshoes
protruded
far
in
advance
enormous
aggressive
he
wore
his
inevitable
hat
of
stiff
brown
straw
varnished
so
bright
that
it
reflected
the
light
of
the
office
windows
like
a
helmet
and
even
from
where
he
stood
dyke
could
hear
his
loud
breathing
and
the
clink
of
the
hollow
links
of
his
watch
chain
upon
the
vest
buttons
of
imitation
pearl
as
his
stomach
rose
and
fell
dyke
looked
at
him
with
attention
there
was
the
enemy
the
representative
of
the
trust
with
which
derrick
league
was
locking
horns
the
great
struggle
had
begun
to
invest
the
combatants
with
interest
daily
almost
hourly
dyke
was
in
touch
with
the
ranchers
the
he
heard
their
denunciations
their
growls
of
exasperation
and
defiance
here
was
the
other
side
this
placid
fat
man
with
a
stiff
straw
hat
and
linen
vest
who
never
lost
his
temper
who
smiled
affably
upon
his
enemies
giving
them
good
advice
commiserating
with
them
in
one
defeat
after
another
never
ruffled
never
excited
sure
of
his
power
conscious
that
back
of
him
was
the
machine
the
colossal
force
the
inexhaustible
coffers
of
a
mighty
organisation
vomiting
millions
to
the
league
thousands
the
league
was
clamorous
ubiquitous
its
objects
known
to
every
urchin
on
the
streets
but
the
trust
was
silent
its
ways
inscrutable
the
public
saw
only
results
it
worked
on
in
the
dark
calm
disciplined
irresistible
abruptly
dyke
received
the
impression
of
the
multitudinous
ramifications
of
the
colossus
under
his
feet
the
ground
seemed
mined
down
there
below
him
in
the
dark
the
huge
tentacles
went
silently
twisting
and
advancing
spreading
out
in
every
direction
sapping
the
strength
of
all
opposition
quiet
gradual
biding
the
time
to
reach
up
and
out
and
grip
with
a
sudden
unleashing
of
gigantic
strength
i
be
wanting
some
cars
of
you
people
before
the
summer
is
out
observed
dyke
to
the
clerk
as
he
folded
up
and
put
away
the
order
that
the
other
had
handed
him
he
remembered
perfectly
well
that
he
had
arranged
the
matter
of
transporting
his
crop
some
months
before
but
his
role
of
proprietor
amused
him
and
he
liked
to
busy
himself
again
and
again
with
the
details
of
his
undertaking
i
suppose
he
added
you
be
able
to
give
to
me
there
be
a
big
wheat
crop
to
move
this
year
and
i
do
want
to
be
caught
in
any
car
oh
you
get
your
cars
murmured
the
other
i
be
the
means
of
bringing
business
your
way
dyke
went
on
done
so
well
with
my
hops
that
there
are
a
lot
of
others
going
into
the
business
next
season
suppose
he
continued
struck
with
an
idea
suppose
we
went
into
some
sort
of
pool
a
sort
of
organisation
could
you
give
us
special
rates
cheaper
rates
say
a
cent
and
a
half
the
other
looked
up
a
cent
and
a
half
say
four
cents
and
a
half
and
maybe
i
talk
business
with
four
cents
and
a
half
returned
dyke
i
do
see
it
why
the
regular
rate
is
only
two
no
it
is
answered
the
clerk
looking
him
gravely
in
the
eye
it
five
well
there
where
you
are
wrong
dyke
retorted
genially
you
look
it
up
you
find
the
freight
on
hops
from
bonneville
to
is
two
cents
a
pound
for
car
load
lots
you
told
me
that
yourself
last
that
was
last
fall
observed
the
clerk
there
was
a
silence
dyke
shot
a
glance
of
suspicion
at
the
other
then
reassured
he
remarked
you
look
it
up
you
see
i
behrman
came
forward
and
shook
hands
politely
with
the
anything
i
can
do
for
you
dyke
dyke
explained
when
he
had
done
speaking
the
clerk
turned
to
behrman
and
observed
respectfully
our
regular
rate
on
hops
is
five
yes
answered
behrman
pausing
to
reflect
yes
dyke
right
five
the
clerk
brought
forward
a
folder
of
yellow
paper
and
handed
it
to
dyke
it
was
inscribed
at
the
top
tariff
schedule
no
and
underneath
these
words
in
brackets
was
a
smaller
inscription
supersedes
no
of
see
for
yourself
said
behrman
he
indicated
an
item
under
the
head
of
the
following
rates
for
carriage
of
hops
in
car
load
lots
read
dyke
take
effect
june
and
will
remain
in
force
until
superseded
by
a
later
tariff
those
quoted
beyond
stockton
are
subject
to
changes
in
traffic
arrangements
with
carriers
by
water
from
that
in
the
list
that
was
printed
below
dyke
saw
that
the
rate
for
hops
between
bonneville
or
guadalajara
and
san
francisco
was
five
cents
for
a
moment
dyke
was
confused
then
swiftly
the
matter
became
clear
in
his
mind
the
railroad
had
raised
the
freight
on
hops
from
two
cents
to
five
all
his
calculations
as
to
a
profit
on
his
little
investment
he
had
based
on
a
freight
rate
of
two
cents
a
pound
he
was
under
contract
to
deliver
his
crop
he
could
not
draw
back
the
new
rate
ate
up
every
cent
of
his
gains
he
stood
there
ruined
why
what
do
you
mean
he
burst
out
you
promised
me
a
rate
of
two
cents
and
i
went
ahead
with
my
business
with
that
understanding
what
do
you
mean
behrman
and
the
clerk
watched
him
from
the
other
side
of
the
counter
the
rate
is
five
cents
declared
the
clerk
doggedly
well
that
ruins
me
shouted
dyke
do
you
understand
i
wo
make
fifty
cents
make
why
i
will
owe
i
be
be
that
ruins
me
do
you
understand
the
other
raised
a
shoulder
we
do
force
you
to
ship
you
can
do
as
you
like
the
rate
is
five
well
but
damn
you
i
under
contract
to
deliver
what
am
i
going
to
do
why
you
told
me
you
promised
me
a
i
do
remember
it
said
the
clerk
i
do
know
anything
about
that
but
i
know
this
i
know
that
hops
have
gone
up
i
know
the
german
crop
was
a
failure
and
that
the
crop
in
new
york
was
worth
the
hauling
hops
have
gone
up
to
nearly
a
dollar
you
do
suppose
we
do
know
that
do
you
dyke
what
the
price
of
hops
got
to
do
with
you
it
got
this
to
do
with
us
returned
the
other
with
a
sudden
aggressiveness
that
the
freight
rate
has
gone
up
to
meet
the
price
we
not
doing
business
for
our
health
my
orders
are
to
raise
your
rate
to
five
cents
and
i
think
you
are
getting
off
dyke
stared
in
blank
astonishment
for
the
moment
the
audacity
of
the
affair
was
what
most
appealed
to
him
he
forgot
its
personal
application
good
lord
he
murmured
good
lord
what
will
you
people
do
next
look
here
what
your
basis
of
applying
freight
rates
anyhow
he
suddenly
vociferated
with
furious
sarcasm
what
your
rule
what
are
you
guided
by
but
at
the
words
behrman
who
had
kept
silent
during
the
heat
of
the
discussion
leaned
abruptly
forward
for
the
only
time
in
his
knowledge
dyke
saw
his
face
inflamed
with
anger
and
with
the
enmity
and
contempt
of
all
this
farming
element
with
whom
he
was
contending
yes
what
your
rule
what
your
basis
demanded
dyke
turning
swiftly
to
him
behrman
emphasised
each
word
of
his
reply
with
a
tap
of
one
forefinger
on
the
counter
before
him
all
the
traffic
will
the
stepped
back
a
pace
his
fingers
on
the
ledge
of
the
counter
to
steady
himself
he
felt
himself
grow
pale
his
heart
became
a
mere
leaden
weight
in
his
chest
inert
refusing
to
beat
in
a
second
the
whole
affair
in
all
its
bearings
went
speeding
before
the
eye
of
his
imagination
like
the
rapid
unrolling
of
a
panorama
every
cent
of
his
earnings
was
sunk
in
this
hop
business
of
his
more
than
that
he
had
borrowed
money
to
carry
it
on
certain
of
success
borrowed
of
behrman
offering
his
crop
and
his
little
home
as
security
once
he
failed
to
meet
his
obligations
behrman
would
foreclose
not
only
would
the
railroad
devour
every
morsel
of
his
profits
but
also
it
would
take
from
him
his
home
at
a
blow
he
would
be
left
penniless
and
without
a
home
what
would
then
become
of
his
mother
and
what
would
become
of
the
little
tad
she
whom
he
had
been
planning
to
educate
like
a
veritable
lady
for
all
that
year
he
had
talked
of
his
ambition
for
his
little
daughter
to
every
one
he
met
all
bonneville
knew
of
it
what
a
mark
for
gibes
he
had
made
of
himself
the
workingman
turned
farmer
what
a
target
for
jeers
he
who
had
fancied
he
could
elude
the
railroad
he
remembered
he
had
once
said
the
great
trust
had
overlooked
his
little
enterprise
disdaining
to
plunder
such
small
fry
he
should
have
known
better
than
that
how
had
he
ever
imagined
the
road
would
permit
him
to
make
any
money
anger
was
not
in
him
yet
no
rousing
of
the
blind
wrath
that
leaps
to
the
attack
with
prehensile
fingers
moved
him
the
blow
merely
crushed
staggered
confused
he
stepped
aside
to
give
place
to
a
coatless
man
in
a
pink
shirt
who
entered
carrying
in
his
hands
an
automatic
apparatus
where
does
this
go
inquired
the
man
dyke
sat
down
for
a
moment
on
a
seat
that
had
been
removed
from
a
railway
car
to
do
duty
in
ruggles
office
on
the
back
of
a
yellow
envelope
he
made
some
vague
figures
with
a
stump
of
blue
pencil
multiplying
subtracting
perplexing
himself
with
many
errors
behrman
the
clerk
and
the
man
with
the
apparatus
involved
themselves
in
a
long
argument
gazing
intently
at
the
top
panel
of
the
door
the
man
who
had
come
to
fix
the
apparatus
was
unwilling
to
guarantee
it
unless
a
sign
was
put
on
the
outside
of
the
door
warning
incomers
that
the
door
was
this
sign
would
cost
fifteen
cents
extra
but
you
did
say
anything
about
this
when
the
thing
was
ordered
declared
behrman
no
i
wo
pay
it
my
friend
it
an
you
need
think
observed
the
clerk
that
just
because
you
are
dealing
with
the
railroad
you
are
going
to
work
genslinger
came
in
accompanied
by
delaney
behrman
and
the
clerk
abruptly
dismissing
the
man
with
the
machine
put
themselves
behind
the
counter
and
engaged
in
conversation
with
these
two
genslinger
introduced
delaney
the
buster
had
a
string
of
horses
he
was
shipping
southward
no
doubt
he
had
come
to
make
arrangements
with
the
railroad
in
the
matter
of
stock
cars
the
conference
of
the
four
men
was
amicable
in
the
extreme
dyke
studying
the
figures
on
the
back
of
the
envelope
came
forward
again
absorbed
only
in
his
own
distress
he
ignored
the
editor
and
the
say
he
hazarded
how
about
this
i
make
out
we
told
you
what
our
rates
are
dyke
exclaimed
the
clerk
angrily
that
all
the
arrangement
we
will
make
take
it
or
leave
he
turned
again
to
genslinger
giving
the
his
back
dyke
moved
away
and
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
centre
of
the
room
staring
at
the
figures
on
the
envelope
i
do
see
he
muttered
just
what
i
going
to
do
no
i
do
see
what
i
going
to
do
at
ruggles
came
in
bringing
with
him
two
other
men
in
whom
dyke
recognised
dummy
buyers
of
the
los
muertos
and
osterman
ranchos
they
brushed
by
him
jostling
his
elbow
and
as
he
went
out
of
the
door
he
heard
them
exchange
jovial
greetings
with
delaney
genslinger
and
behrman
dyke
went
down
the
stairs
to
the
street
and
proceeded
onward
aimlessly
in
the
direction
of
the
yosemite
house
fingering
the
yellow
envelope
and
looking
vacantly
at
the
sidewalk
there
was
a
stoop
to
his
massive
shoulders
his
great
arms
dangled
loosely
at
his
sides
the
palms
of
his
hands
open
as
he
went
along
a
certain
feeling
of
shame
touched
him
surely
his
predicament
must
be
apparent
to
every
no
doubt
every
one
recognised
the
unsuccessful
man
in
the
very
way
he
slouched
along
the
young
girls
in
lawns
muslins
and
garden
hats
returning
from
the
post
office
their
hands
full
of
letters
must
surely
see
in
him
the
type
of
the
failure
the
bankrupt
then
brusquely
his
tardy
rage
flamed
up
by
god
no
it
was
not
his
fault
he
had
made
no
mistake
his
energy
industry
and
foresight
had
been
sound
he
had
been
merely
the
object
of
a
colossal
trick
a
sordid
injustice
a
victim
of
the
insatiate
greed
of
the
monster
caught
and
choked
by
one
of
those
millions
of
tentacles
suddenly
reaching
up
from
below
from
out
the
dark
beneath
his
feet
coiling
around
his
throat
throttling
him
strangling
him
sucking
his
blood
for
a
moment
he
thought
of
the
courts
but
instantly
laughed
at
the
idea
what
court
was
immune
from
the
power
of
the
monster
ah
the
rage
of
helplessness
the
fury
of
impotence
no
help
no
hope
ruined
in
a
brief
instant
he
a
veritable
giant
built
of
great
sinews
powerful
in
the
full
tide
of
his
manhood
having
all
his
health
all
his
wits
how
could
he
now
face
his
home
how
could
he
tell
his
mother
of
this
catastrophe
and
sidney
the
little
tad
how
could
he
explain
to
her
this
wretchedness
how
soften
her
disappointment
how
keep
the
tears
from
out
her
eyes
how
keep
alive
her
confidence
in
him
her
faith
in
his
resources
bitter
fierce
ominous
his
wrath
loomed
up
in
his
heart
his
fists
gripped
tight
together
his
teeth
clenched
oh
for
a
moment
to
have
his
hand
upon
the
throat
of
behrman
wringing
the
breath
from
him
wrenching
out
the
red
life
of
him
staining
the
street
with
the
blood
sucked
from
the
veins
of
the
people
to
the
first
friend
that
he
met
dyke
told
the
tale
of
the
tragedy
and
to
the
next
and
to
the
next
the
affair
went
from
mouth
to
mouth
spreading
with
electrical
swiftness
overpassing
and
running
ahead
of
dyke
himself
so
that
by
the
time
he
reached
the
lobby
of
the
yosemite
house
he
found
his
story
awaiting
him
a
group
formed
about
him
in
his
immediate
vicinity
business
for
the
instant
was
suspended
the
group
swelled
one
after
another
of
his
friends
added
themselves
to
it
magnus
derrick
joined
it
and
annixter
again
and
again
dyke
recounted
the
matter
beginning
with
the
time
when
he
was
discharged
from
the
same
corporation
service
for
refusing
to
accept
an
unfair
wage
his
voice
quivered
with
exasperation
his
heavy
frame
shook
with
rage
his
eyes
were
injected
bloodshot
his
face
flamed
vermilion
while
his
deep
bass
rumbled
throughout
the
running
comments
of
his
auditors
like
the
thunderous
reverberation
of
diapason
from
all
points
of
view
the
story
was
discussed
by
those
who
listened
to
him
now
in
the
heat
of
excitement
now
calmly
judicially
one
verdict
however
prevailed
it
was
voiced
by
annixter
you
stuck
you
can
roar
till
you
black
in
the
face
but
you
ca
buck
against
the
railroad
there
nothing
to
be
you
can
shoot
the
ruffian
you
can
shoot
behrman
clamoured
one
of
the
group
yes
sir
by
the
lord
you
can
shoot
poor
fool
commented
annixter
turning
away
nothing
to
be
done
no
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
not
one
thing
dyke
at
last
alone
and
driving
his
team
out
of
the
town
turned
the
business
confusedly
over
in
his
mind
from
end
to
end
advice
suggestion
even
offers
of
financial
aid
had
been
showered
upon
him
from
all
directions
friends
were
not
wanting
who
heatedly
presented
to
his
consideration
all
manner
of
ingenious
plans
wonderful
devices
they
were
worthless
the
tentacle
held
fast
he
was
stuck
by
degrees
as
his
wagon
carried
him
farther
out
into
the
country
and
open
empty
fields
his
anger
lapsed
and
the
numbness
of
bewilderment
returned
he
could
not
look
one
hour
ahead
into
the
future
could
formulate
no
plans
even
for
the
next
day
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
he
was
stuck
with
the
limpness
and
inertia
of
a
sack
of
sand
the
reins
slipping
loosely
in
his
dangling
fingers
his
eyes
fixed
staring
between
the
horses
heads
he
allowed
himself
to
be
carried
aimlessly
along
he
resigned
himself
what
did
he
care
what
was
the
use
of
going
on
he
was
stuck
the
team
he
was
driving
had
once
belonged
to
the
los
muertos
stables
and
unguided
as
the
horses
were
they
took
the
county
road
towards
ranch
house
dyke
all
abroad
was
unaware
of
the
fact
till
drawn
by
the
smell
of
water
the
horses
halted
by
the
trough
in
front
of
caraher
saloon
the
dismounted
looking
about
him
realising
where
he
was
so
much
the
worse
it
did
not
matter
now
that
he
had
come
so
far
it
was
as
short
to
go
home
by
this
route
as
to
return
on
his
tracks
slowly
he
unchecked
the
horses
and
stood
at
their
heads
watching
them
drink
i
do
see
he
muttered
just
what
i
am
going
to
caraher
appeared
at
the
door
of
his
place
his
red
face
red
beard
and
flaming
cravat
standing
sharply
out
from
the
shadow
of
the
doorway
he
called
a
welcome
to
dyke
hello
dyke
looked
up
nodding
his
head
listlessly
hello
caraher
he
answered
well
continued
the
saloonkeeper
coming
forward
a
step
what
the
news
in
town
dyke
told
him
caraher
red
face
suddenly
took
on
a
darker
colour
the
red
glint
in
his
eyes
shot
from
under
his
eyebrows
furious
he
vented
a
rolling
explosion
of
oaths
and
now
it
your
turn
he
vociferated
they
ai
after
only
the
big
the
rich
men
by
god
they
even
pick
the
poor
pocket
oh
they
get
their
bellies
full
some
day
it
ca
last
forever
they
wake
up
the
wrong
kind
of
man
some
morning
the
man
that
got
guts
in
him
that
will
hit
back
when
he
kicked
and
that
will
talk
to
with
a
torch
in
one
hand
and
a
stick
of
dynamite
in
the
he
raised
his
clenched
fists
in
the
air
so
help
me
god
he
cried
when
i
think
it
all
over
i
go
crazy
i
see
red
oh
if
the
people
only
knew
their
strength
oh
if
i
could
wake
up

not
only
shelgrim
but

the
magnates

the
butchers

the
by
the
thousands
their
day
will
come
by
god
it
by
now
the
and
the
had
retired
to
the
saloon
back
of
the
grocery
to
talk
over
the
details
of
this
new
outrage
dyke
still
a
little
dazed
sat
down
by
one
of
the
tables
preoccupied
saying
but
little
and
caraher
as
a
matter
of
course
set
the
whiskey
bottle
at
his
elbow
it
happened
that
at
this
same
moment
presley
returning
to
los
muertos
from
bonneville
his
pockets
full
of
mail
stopped
in
at
the
grocery
to
buy
some
black
lead
for
his
bicycle
in
the
saloon
on
the
other
side
of
the
narrow
partition
he
overheard
the
conversation
between
dyke
and
caraher
the
door
was
open
he
caught
every
word
distinctly
tell
us
all
about
it
dyke
urged
caraher
for
the
fiftieth
time
dyke
told
the
story
already
it
had
crystallised
into
a
certain
form
he
used
the
same
phrases
with
each
repetition
the
same
sentences
the
same
words
in
his
mind
it
became
set
thus
he
would
tell
it
to
any
one
who
would
listen
from
now
on
week
after
week
year
after
year
all
the
rest
of
his
life
and
i
based
my
calculations
on
a
rate
so
soon
as
they
saw
i
was
to
make
money
they
doubled
the
tariff
all
the
traffic
would
bear
and
i
mortgaged
to
behrman
ruined
me
with
a
turn
of
the
hand
stuck
cinched
and
not
one
thing
to
be
as
he
talked
he
drank
glass
after
glass
of
whiskey
and
the
honest
rage
the
open
fury
of
his
mind
coagulated
thickened
and
sunk
to
a
dull
evil
hatred
a
wicked
oblique
malevolence
caraher
sure
now
of
winning
a
disciple
replenished
his
glass
do
you
blame
us
now
he
cried
us
others
the
reds
ah
yes
all
very
well
for
your
middle
class
to
preach
moderation
i
could
do
it
too
you
could
do
it
too
if
your
belly
was
fed
if
your
property
was
safe
if
your
wife
had
not
been
murdered
if
your
children
were
not
starving
easy
enough
then
to
preach
methods
legal
redress
and
all
such
rot
but
how
about
us
he
vociferated
ah
yes
i
a
ai
i
i
a
striker
ai
i
i
a
anarchist
ai
i
wait
till
you
seen
your
wife
brought
home
to
you
with
the
face
you
used
to
kiss
smashed
in
by
a
horse
hoof
killed
by
the
trust
as
it
happened
to
me
then
talk
about
moderation
and
you
dyke
engineer
discharged
employee
ruined
agriculturist
wait
till
you
see
your
little
tad
and
your
mother
turned
out
of
doors
when
behrman
forecloses
wait
till
you
see
getting
thin
and
white
and
till
you
hear
your
little
girl
ask
you
why
you
all
do
eat
a
little
more
and
that
she
wants
her
dinner
and
you
ca
give
it
to
her
wait
till
you
see
at
the
same
time
that
your
family
is
dying
for
lack
of
bread
a
hundred
thousand
acres
of
wheat
millions
of
bushels
of
food
grabbed
and
gobbled
by
the
railroad
trust
and
then
talk
of
moderation
that
talk
is
just
what
the
trust
wants
to
hear
it
ai
frightened
of
that
there
one
thing
only
it
does
listen
to
one
thing
it
is
frightened
of
the
people
with
dynamite
in
their
hands
six
inches
of
plugged
gaspipe
that
dyke
did
not
reply
he
filled
another
pony
of
whiskey
and
drank
it
in
two
gulps
his
frown
had
lowered
to
a
scowl
his
face
was
a
dark
red
his
head
had
sunk
between
his
massive
shoulders
without
winking
he
gazed
long
and
with
troubled
eyes
at
his
knotted
muscular
hands
lying
open
on
the
table
before
him
idle
their
occupation
gone
presley
forgot
his
black
lead
he
listened
to
caraher
through
the
open
door
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
dyke
back
broad
muscled
bowed
down
the
great
shoulders
stooping
the
whole
drama
of
the
doubled
freight
rate
leaped
salient
and
distinct
in
the
eye
of
his
mind
and
this
was
but
one
instance
an
isolated
case
because
he
was
near
at
hand
he
happened
to
see
it
how
many
others
were
there
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
state
constantly
this
sort
of
thing
must
occur
little
industries
choked
out
in
their
very
beginnings
the
air
full
of
the
death
rattles
of
little
enterprises
expiring
unobserved
in
counties
up
in
canyons
and
arroyos
of
the
foothills
forgotten
by
every
one
but
the
monster
who
was
daunted
by
the
magnitude
of
no
business
however
great
who
overlooked
no
opportunity
of
plunder
however
petty
who
with
one
tentacle
grabbed
a
hundred
thousand
acres
of
wheat
and
with
another
pilfered
a
pocketful
of
growing
hops
he
went
away
without
a
word
his
head
bent
his
hands
clutched
tightly
on
the
cork
grips
of
the
handle
bars
of
his
bicycle
his
lips
were
white
in
his
heart
a
blind
demon
of
revolt
raged
tumultuous
shrieking
blasphemies
at
los
muertos
presley
overtook
annixter
as
he
guided
his
wheel
up
the
driveway
to
derrick
ranch
house
he
saw
the
master
of
quien
sabe
and
harran
in
conversation
on
the
steps
of
the
porch
magnus
stood
in
the
doorway
talking
to
his
wife
occupied
with
the
press
of
business
and
involved
in
the
final
conference
with
the
league
lawyers
on
the
eve
of
the
latter
departure
for
washington
annixter
had
missed
the
train
that
was
to
take
him
back
to
guadalajara
and
quien
sabe
accordingly
he
had
accepted
the
invitation
to
return
with
him
on
his
to
los
muertos
and
before
leaving
bonneville
had
telephoned
to
his
ranch
to
have
young
vacca
bring
the
buckskin
by
way
of
the
lower
road
to
meet
him
at
los
muertos
he
found
her
waiting
there
for
him
but
before
going
on
delayed
a
few
moments
to
tell
harran
of
dyke
affair
i
wonder
what
he
will
do
now
observed
harran
when
his
first
outburst
of
indignation
had
subsided
nothing
declared
annixter
he
that
eats
up
every
cent
of
dyke
earnings
harran
went
on
he
has
been
ten
years
saving
them
oh
i
told
him
to
make
sure
of
the
railroad
when
he
first
spoke
to
me
about
growing
i
just
seen
him
said
presley
as
he
joined
the
others
he
was
at
caraher
i
only
saw
his
back
he
was
drinking
at
a
table
and
his
back
was
towards
me
but
the
man
looked
broken
absolutely
crushed
it
is
terrible
he
was
at
caraher
was
he
demanded
annixter
drinking
hey
i
think
so
yes
i
saw
a
drinking
at
caraher
exclaimed
annixter
rancorously
i
can
see
his
there
was
a
silence
it
seemed
as
if
nothing
more
was
to
be
said
they
paused
looking
thoughtfully
on
the
ground
in
silence
grim
bitter
infinitely
sad
the
three
men
as
if
at
that
moment
actually
standing
in
the
of
caraher
roadside
saloon
contemplated
the
slow
sinking
the
inevitable
collapse
and
submerging
of
one
of
their
companions
the
wreck
of
a
career
the
ruin
of
an
individual
an
honest
man
strong
fearless
upright
struck
down
by
a
colossal
power
perverted
by
an
evil
influence
go

to
his
ruin
i

his

repeated
annixter
exit
dyke
and
score
another
tally
for
behrman
shelgrim
and
he
moved
away
impatiently
loosening
the
with
which
the
buckskin
was
fastened
he
swung
himself
up
god
for
us
all
he
declared

he
rode
away

the

he
galloped
away
along
the
lower
road
in
the
direction
of
quien
sabe
emerging
from
the
grove
of
cypress
and
eucalyptus
about
the
ranch
house
and
coming
out
upon
the
bare
brown
plain
of
the
wheat
land
stretching
away
from
him
in
apparent
barrenness
on
either
hand
it
was
late
in
the
day
already
his
shadow
was
long
upon
the
padded
dust
of
the
road
in
front
of
him
on
ahead
a
long
ways
off
and
a
little
to
the
north
the
venerable
campanile
of
the
mission
san
juan
was
glinting
radiant
in
the
last
rays
of
the
sun
while
behind
him
towards
the
north
and
west
the
gilded
dome
of
the
courthouse
at
bonneville
stood
silhouetted
in
purplish
black
against
the
flaming
west
annixter
spurred
the
forward
he
feared
he
might
be
late
to
his
supper
he
wondered
if
it
would
be
brought
to
him
by
hilma
hilma
the
name
struck
across
in
his
brain
with
a
pleasant
glowing
tremour
all
through
that
day
of
activity
of
strenuous
business
the
minute
and
cautious
planning
of
the
final
campaign
in
the
great
war
of
the
league
and
the
trust
the
idea
of
her
and
the
recollection
of
her
had
been
the
undercurrent
of
his
thoughts
at
last
he
was
alone
he
could
put
all
other
things
behind
him
and
occupy
himself
solely
with
her
in
that
glory
of
the
day
end
in
that
chaos
of
sunshine
he
saw
her
again
unimaginative
crude
direct
his
fancy
nevertheless
placed
her
before
him
steeped
in
sunshine
saturated
with
glorious
light
brilliant
radiant
alluring
he
saw
the
sweet
simplicity
of
her
carriage
the
statuesque
evenness
of
the
contours
of
her
figure
the
single
deep
swell
of
her
bosom
the
solid
masses
of
her
hair
he
remembered
the
small
contradictory
suggestions
of
feminine
daintiness
he
had
so
often
remarked
about
her
her
slim
narrow
feet
the
little
steel
buckles
of
her
low
shoes
the
knot
of
black
ribbon
she
had
begun
to
wear
of
late
on
the
back
of
her
head
and
he
heard
her
voice
velvety
a
sweet
murmuring
huskiness
that
seemed
to
come
more
from
her
chest
than
from
her
throat
the
buckskin
hoofs
clattered
upon
the
gravelly
flats
of
creek
underneath
the
long
trestle
annixter
mind
went
back
to
the
scene
of
the
previous
evening
when
he
had
come
upon
her
at
this
place
he
set
his
teeth
with
anger
and
disappointment
why
had
she
not
been
able
to
understand
what
was
the
matter
with
these
women
always
set
upon
this
marrying
notion
was
it
not
enough
that
he
wanted
her
more
than
any
other
girl
he
knew
and
that
she
wanted
him
she
had
said
as
much
did
she
think
she
was
going
to
be
mistress
of
quien
sabe
ah
that
was
it
she
was
after
his
property
was
for
marrying
him
because
of
his
money
his
unconquerable
suspicion
of
the
woman
his
innate
distrust
of
the
feminine
element
would
not
be
done
away
with
what
fathomless
duplicity
was
hers
that
she
could
appear
so
innocent
it
was
almost
unbelievable
in
fact
was
it
believable
for
the
first
time
doubt
assailed
him
suppose
hilma
was
indeed
all
that
she
appeared
to
be
suppose
it
was
not
with
her
a
question
of
his
property
after
all
it
was
a
poor
time
to
think
of
marrying
him
for
his
property
when
all
quien
sabe
hung
in
the
issue
of
the
next
few
months
suppose
she
had
been
sincere
but
he
caught
himself
up
was
he
to
be
fooled
by
a
feemale
girl
at
this
late
date
he
buck
annixter
crafty
a
man
of
affairs
not
much
whatever
transpired
he
would
remain
the
master
he
reached
quien
sabe
in
this
frame
of
mind
but
at
this
hour
annixter
for
all
his
resolutions
could
no
longer
control
his
thoughts
as
he
stripped
the
saddle
from
the
buckskin
and
led
her
to
the
watering
trough
by
the
stable
corral
his
heart
was
beating
thick
at
the
very
notion
of
being
near
hilma
again
it
was
growing
dark
but
covertly
he
glanced
here
and
there
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
to
see
if
she
was
anywhere
about
annixter
how
he
could
not
tell
had
become
possessed
of
the
idea
that
hilma
would
not
inform
her
parents
of
what
had
passed
between
them
the
previous
evening
under
the
long
trestle
he
had
no
idea
that
matters
were
at
an
end
between
himself
and
the
young
woman
he
must
apologise
he
saw
that
clearly
enough
must
eat
crow
as
he
told
himself
well
he
would
eat
crow
he
was
not
afraid
of
her
any
longer
now
that
she
had
made
her
confession
to
him
he
would
see
her
as
soon
as
possible
and
get
this
business
straightened
out
and
begin
again
from
a
new
starting
point
what
he
wanted
with
hilma
annixter
did
not
define
clearly
in
his
mind
at
one
time
he
had
known
perfectly
well
what
he
wanted
now
the
goal
of
his
desires
had
become
vague
he
could
not
say
exactly
what
it
was
he
preferred
that
things
should
go
forward
without
much
idea
of
consequences
if
consequences
came
they
would
do
so
naturally
enough
and
of
themselves
all
that
he
positively
knew
was
that
hilma
occupied
his
thoughts
morning
noon
and
night
that
he
was
happy
when
he
was
with
her
and
miserable
when
away
from
her
the
chinese
cook
served
his
supper
in
silence
annixter
ate
and
drank
and
lighted
a
cigar
and
after
his
meal
sat
on
the
porch
of
his
house
smoking
and
enjoying
the
twilight
the
evening
was
beautiful
warm
the
sky
one
powder
of
stars
from
the
direction
of
the
stables
he
heard
one
of
the
portuguese
hands
picking
a
guitar
but
he
wanted
to
see
hilma
the
idea
of
going
to
bed
without
at
least
a
glimpse
of
her
became
distasteful
to
him
annixter
got
up
and
descending
from
the
porch
began
to
walk
aimlessly
about
between
the
ranch
buildings
with
eye
and
ear
alert
possibly
he
might
meet
her
somewheres
the
trees
little
house
toward
which
inevitably
annixter
directed
his
steps
was
dark
had
they
all
gone
to
bed
so
soon
he
made
a
wide
circuit
about
it
listening
but
heard
no
sound
the
door
of
the
stood
ajar
he
pushed
it
open
and
stepped
into
the
odorous
darkness
of
its
interior
the
pans
and
deep
cans
of
polished
metal
glowed
faintly
from
the
corners
and
from
the
walls
the
smell
of
new
cheese
was
pungent
in
his
nostrils
everything
was
quiet
there
was
nobody
there
he
went
out
again
closing
the
door
and
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
space
between
the
and
the
new
barn
uncertain
as
to
what
he
should
do
next
as
he
waited
there
his
foreman
came
out
of
the
men
bunk
house
on
the
other
side
of
the
kitchens
and
crossed
over
toward
the
barn
hello
billy
muttered
annixter
as
he
passed
oh
good
evening
annixter
said
the
other
pausing
in
front
of
him
i

he
added
speaking
as

matter
was
already
known
to
annixter

family

to
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
strode
away
straight
before
him
not
caring
where
he
was
going
he
tramped
out
from
the
group
of
ranch
buildings
holding
on
over
the
open
reach
of
his
ranch
his
teeth
set
his
heels
digging
furiously
into
the
ground
the
minutes
passed
he
walked
on
swiftly
muttering
to
himself
from
time
to
time
gone
by
the
lord
gone
by
the
lord
by
the
lord
harry
she
cleared
as
yet
his
head
was
empty
of
all
thought
he
could
not
steady
his
wits
to
consider
this
new
turn
of
affairs
he
did
not
even
try
gone
by
the
lord
he
exclaimed
by
the
lord
she
cleared
he
found
the
irrigating
ditch
and
the
beaten
path
made
by
the
ditch
tenders
that
bordered
it
and
followed
it
some
five
minutes
then
struck
off
at
right
angles
over
the
rugged
surface
of
the
ranch
land
to
where
a
great
white
stone
jutted
from
the
ground
there
he
sat
down
and
leaning
forward
rested
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
looked
out
vaguely
into
the
night
his
thoughts
swiftly
readjusting
themselves
he
was
alone
the
silence
of
the
night
the
infinite
repose
of
the
flat
bare
earth
two
immensities
widened
around
and
above
him
like
illimitable
seas
a
grey
mysterious
grave
flooded
downward
from
the
stars
annixter
was
in
torment
now
there
could
be
no
longer
any
doubt
now
it
was
hilma
or
nothing
once
out
of
his
reach
once
lost
to
him
and
the
recollection
of
her
assailed
him
with
unconquerable
vehemence
much
as
she
had
occupied
his
mind
he
had
never
realised
till
now
how
vast
had
been
the
place
she
had
filled
in
his
life
he
had
told
her
as
much
but
even
then
he
did
not
believe
it
suddenly
a
bitter
rage
against
himself
overwhelmed
him
as
he
thought
of
the
hurt
he
had
given
her
the
previous
evening
he
should
have
managed
differently
how
he
did
not
know
but
the
sense
of
the
outrage
he
had
put
upon
her
abruptly
recoiled
against
him
with
cruel
force
now
he
was
sorry
for
it
infinitely
sorry
passionately
sorry
he
had
hurt
her
he
had
brought
the
tears
to
her
eyes
he
had
so
flagrantly
insulted
her
that
she
could
no
longer
bear
to
breathe
the
same
air
with
him
she
had
told
her
parents
all
she
had
left
quien
sabe
had
left
him
for
good
at
the
very
moment
when
he
believed
he
had
won
her
brute
beast
that
he
was
he
had
driven
her
away
an
hour
went
by
then
two
then
four
then
six
annixter
still
sat
in
his
place
groping
and
battling
in
a
confusion
of
spirit
the
like
of
which
he
had
never
felt
before
he
did
not
know
what
was
the
matter
with
him
he
could
not
find
his
way
out
of
the
dark
and
out
of
the
turmoil
that
wheeled
around
him
he
had
had
no
experience
with
women
there
was
no
precedent
to
guide
him
how
was
he
to
get
out
of
this
what
was
the
clew
that
would
set
everything
straight
again
that
he
would
give
hilma
up
never
once
entered
his
head
have
her
he
would
she
had
given
herself
to
him
everything
should
have
been
easy
after
that
and
instead
here
he
was
alone
in
the
night
wrestling
with
himself
in
deeper
trouble
than
ever
and
hilma
farther
than
ever
away
from
him
it
was
true
he
might
have
hilma
even
now
if
he
was
willing
to
marry
her
but
marriage
to
his
mind
had
been
always
a
vague
most
remote
possibility
almost
as
vague
and
as
remote
as
his
death
a
thing
that
happened
to
some
men
but
that
would
surely
never
occur
to
him
or
if
it
did
it
would
be
after
long
years
had
passed
when
he
was
older
more
settled
more
mature
an
event
that
belonged
to
the
period
of
his
middle
life
distant
as
yet
he
had
never
faced
the
question
of
his
marriage
he
had
kept
it
at
an
immense
distance
from
him
it
had
never
been
a
part
of
his
order
of
things
he
was
not
a
marrying
man
but
hilma
was
an
reality
as
near
to
him
as
his
right
hand
marriage
was
a
formless
far
distant
abstraction
hilma
a
tangible
imminent
fact
before
he
could
think
of
the
two
as
one
before
he
could
consider
the
idea
of
marriage
side
by
side
with
the
idea
of
hilma
measureless
distances
had
to
be
traversed
things
as
disassociated
in
his
mind
as
fire
and
water
had
to
be
fused
together
and
between
the
two
he
was
torn
as
if
upon
a
rack
slowly
by
imperceptible
degrees
the
imagination
unused
unwilling
machine
began
to
work
the
brain
activity
lapsed
proportionately
he
began
to
think
less
and
feel
more
in
that
rugged
composition
confused
dark
harsh
a
furrow
had
been
driven
deep
a
little
seed
planted
a
little
seed
at
first
weak
forgotten
lost
in
the
lower
dark
places
of
his
character
but
as
the
intellect
moved
slower
its
functions
growing
numb
the
idea
of
self
dwindled
annixter
no
longer
considered
himself
no
longer
considered
the
notion
of
marriage
from
the
point
of
view
of
his
own
comfort
his
own
wishes
his
own
advantage
he
realised
that
in
his
newfound
desire
to
make
her
happy
he
was
sincere
there
was
something
in
that
idea
after
all
to
make
some
one
happy
how
about
that
now
it
was
worth
thinking
of
far
away
low
down
in
the
east
a
dim
belt
a
grey
light
began
to
whiten
over
the
horizon
the
tower
of
the
mission
stood
black
against
it
the
dawn
was
coming
the
baffling
obscurity
of
the
night
was
passing
hidden
things
were
coming
into
view
annixter
his
eyes
his
chin
upon
his
fist
allowed
his
imagination
full
play
how
would
it
be
if
he
should
take
hilma
into
his
life
this
beautiful
young
girl
pure
as
he
now
knew
her
to
be
innocent
noble
with
the
inborn
nobility
of
dawning
womanhood
an
overwhelming
sense
of
his
own
unworthiness
suddenly
bore
down
upon
him
with
crushing
force
as
he
thought
of
this
he
had
gone
about
the
whole
affair
wrongly
he
had
been
mistaken
from
the
very
first
she
was
infinitely
above
him
he
did
not
want
he
should
not
desire
to
be
the
master
it
was
she
his
servant
poor
simple
lowly
even
who
should
condescend
to
him
abruptly
there
was
presented
to
his
mind
eye
a
picture
of
the
years
to
come
if
he
now
should
follow
his
best
his
highest
his
most
unselfish
impulse
he
saw
hilma
his
own
for
better
or
for
worse
for
richer
or
for
poorer
all
barriers
down
between
them
he
giving
himself
to
her
as
freely
as
nobly
as
she
had
given
herself
to
him
by
a
supreme
effort
not
of
the
will
but
of
the
emotion
he
fought
his
way
across
that
vast
gulf
that
for
a
time
had
gaped
between
hilma
and
the
idea
of
his
marriage
instantly
like
the
swift
blending
of
beautiful
colours
like
the
harmony
of
beautiful
chords
of
music
the
two
ideas
melted
into
one
and
in
that
moment
into
his
harsh
unlovely
world
a
new
idea
was
born
annixter
stood
suddenly
upright
a
mighty
tenderness
a
gentleness
of
spirit
such
as
he
had
never
conceived
of
in
his
heart
strained
swelled
and
in
a
moment
seemed
to
burst
out
of
the
dark
furrows
of
his
soul
up
from
the
deep
rugged
recesses
of
his
being
something
rose
expanding
he
opened
his
arms
wide
an
immense
happiness
overpowered
him
actual
tears
came
to
his
eyes
without
knowing
why
he
was
not
ashamed
of
it
this
poor
crude
fellow
harsh
hard
narrow
with
his
unlovely
nature
his
fierce
truculency
his
selfishness
his
obstinacy
abruptly
knew
that
all
the
sweetness
of
life
all
the
great
vivifying
eternal
force
of
humanity
had
burst
into
life
within
him
the
little
seed
long
since
planted
gathering
strength
quietly
had
at
last
germinated
then
as
the
realisation
of
this
hardened
into
certainty
in
the
growing
light
of
the
new
day
that
had
just
dawned
for
him
annixter
uttered
a
cry
now
at
length
he
knew
the
meaning
of
it
all
why
i
i
i
love
her
he
cried
never
until
then
had
it
occurred
to
him
never
until
then
in
all
his
thoughts
of
hilma
had
that
great
word
passed
his
lips
it
was
a
memnonian
cry
the
greeting
of
the
hard
harsh
image
of
man
flinty
granitic
uttering
a
note
of
joy
acclaiming
the
new
risen
sun
by
now
it
was
almost
day
the
east
glowed
opalescent
all
about
him
annixter
saw
the
land
inundated
with
light
but
there
was
a
change
overnight
something
had
occurred
in
his
perturbation
the
change
seemed
to
him
at
first
elusive
almost
fanciful
unreal
but
now
as
the
light
spread
he
looked
again
at
the
gigantic
scroll
of
ranch
lands
unrolled
before
him
from
edge
to
edge
of
the
horizon
the
change
was
not
fanciful
the
change
was
real
the
earth
was
no
longer
bare
the
land
was
no
longer
barren
no
longer
empty
no
longer
dull
brown
all
at
once
annixter
shouted
aloud
there
it
was
the
wheat
the
wheat
the
little
seed
long
planted
germinating
in
the
deep
dark
furrows
of
the
soil
straining
swelling
suddenly
in
one
night
had
burst
upward
to
the
light
the
wheat
had
come
up
it
was
there
before
him
around
him
everywhere
illimitable
immeasurable
the
winter
brownness
of
the
ground
was
overlaid
with
a
little
shimmer
of
green
the
promise
of
the
sowing
was
being
fulfilled
the
earth
the
loyal
mother
who
never
failed
who
never
disappointed
was
keeping
her
faith
again
once
more
the
strength
of
nations
was
renewed
once
more
the
force
of
the
world
was
revivified
once
more
the
titan
benignant
calm
stirred
and
woke
and
the
morning
abruptly
blazed
into
glory
upon
the
spectacle
of
a
man
whose
heart
leaped
exuberant
with
the
love
of
a
woman
and
an
exulting
earth
gleaming
transcendent
with
the
radiant
magnificence
of
an
inviolable
pledge
chapter
iii
presley
room
in
the
ranch
house
of
los
muertos
was
in
the
second
story
of
the
building
it
was
a
corner
room
one
of
its
windows
facing
the
south
the
other
the
east
its
appointments
were
of
the
simplest
in
one
angle
was
the
small
white
painted
iron
bed
covered
with
a
white
counterpane
the
walls
were
hung
with
a
white
paper
figured
with
knots
of
pale
green
leaves
very
gay
and
bright
there
was
a
straw
matting
on
the
floor
white
muslin
hung
in
the
windows
upon
the
sills
of
which
certain
plants
bearing
pink
waxen
flowers
of
which
presley
did
not
know
the
name
grew
in
oblong
green
boxes
the
walls
were
unadorned
save
by
two
pictures
one
a
reproduction
of
the
reading
from
homer
the
other
a
charcoal
drawing
of
the
mission
of
san
juan
de
guadalajara
which
presley
had
made
himself
by
the
east
window
stood
the
plainest
of
deal
tables
innocent
of
any
cloth
or
covering
such
as
might
have
been
used
in
a
kitchen
it
was
presley
work
table
and
was
invariably
littered
with
papers
manuscripts
drafts
of
poems
notebooks
pens
cigarettes
and
the
like
near
at
hand
upon
a
shelf
were
his
books
there
were
but
two
chairs
in
the
room
the
straight
backed
wooden
chair
that
stood
in
front
of
the
table
angular
upright
and
in
which
it
was
impossible
to
take
ease
and
the
long
comfortable
wicker
steamer
chair
stretching
its
length
in
front
of
the
south
window
presley
was
immensely
fond
of
this
room
it
amused
and
interested
him
to
maintain
its
air
of
rigorous
simplicity
and
freshness
he
abhorred
cluttered
and
meaningless
objets
once
in
so
often
he
submitted
his
room
to
a
vigorous
inspection
setting
it
to
rights
removing
everything
but
the
essentials
the
few
ornaments
which
in
a
way
were
part
of
his
life
his
writing
had
by
this
time
undergone
a
complete
change
the
notes
for
his
great
song
of
the
west
the
epic
poem
he
once
had
hoped
to
write
he
had
flung
aside
together
with
all
the
abortive
attempts
at
its
beginning
also
he
had
torn
up
a
great
quantity
of
fugitive
verses
preserving
only
a
certain
poem
that
he
called
the
this
poem
was
a
comment
upon
the
social
fabric
and
had
been
inspired
by
the
sight
of
a
painting
he
had
seen
in
cedarquist
art
gallery
he
had
written
all
but
the
last
verse
on
the
day
that
he
had
overheard
the
conversation
between
dyke
and
caraher
in
the
latter
saloon
which
had
acquainted
him
with
the
monstrous
injustice
of
the
increased
tariff
presley
had
returned
to
los
muertos
white
and
trembling
roused
to
a
pitch
of
exaltation
the
like
of
which
he
had
never
known
in
all
his
life
his
wrath
was
little
short
of
even
caraher
he
too
saw
red
a
mighty
spirit
of
revolt
heaved
tumultuous
within
him
it
did
not
seem
possible
that
this
outrage
could
go
on
much
longer
the
oppression
was
incredible
the
plain
story
of
it
set
down
in
truthful
statement
of
fact
would
not
be
believed
by
the
outside
world
he
went
up
to
his
little
room
and
paced
the
floor
with
clenched
fists
and
burning
face
till
at
last
the
repression
of
his
contending
thoughts
all
but
suffocated
him
and
he
flung
himself
before
his
table
and
began
to
write
for
a
time
his
pen
seemed
to
travel
of
itself
words
came
to
him
without
searching
shaping
themselves
into
phrases
the
phrases
building
themselves
up
to
great
forcible
sentences
full
of
eloquence
of
fire
of
passion
as
his
prose
grew
more
exalted
it
passed
easily
into
the
domain
of
poetry
soon
the
cadence
of
his
paragraphs
settled
to
an
ordered
beat
and
rhythm
and
in
the
end
presley
had
thrust
aside
his
journal
and
was
once
more
writing
verse
he
picked
up
his
incomplete
poem
of
the
toilers
read
it
hastily
a
couple
of
times
to
catch
its
swing
then
the
idea
of
the
last
verse
the
idea
for
which
he
so
long
had
sought
in
vain
abruptly
springing
to
his
brain
wrote
it
off
without
so
much
as
replenishing
his
pen
with
ink
he
added
still
another
verse
bringing
the
poem
to
a
definite
close
resuming
its
entire
conception
and
ending
with
a
single
majestic
thought
simple
noble
dignified
absolutely
convincing
presley
laid
down
his
pen
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
the
certainty
that
for
one
moment
he
had
touched
untrod
heights
his
hands
were
cold
his
head
on
fire
his
heart
leaping
tumultuous
in
his
breast
now
at
last
he
had
achieved
he
saw
why
he
had
never
grasped
the
inspiration
for
his
vast
vague
impersonal
song
of
the
west
at
the
time
when
he
sought
for
it
his
convictions
had
not
been
aroused
he
had
not
then
cared
for
the
people
his
sympathies
had
not
been
touched
small
wonder
that
he
had
missed
it
now
he
was
of
the
people
he
had
been
stirred
to
his
lowest
depths
his
earnestness
was
almost
a
frenzy
he
believed
and
so
to
him
all
things
were
possible
at
once
then
the
artist
in
him
reasserted
itself
he
became
more
interested
in
his
poem
as
such
than
in
the
cause
that
had
inspired
it
he
went
over
it
again
retouching
it
carefully
changing
a
word
here
and
there
and
improving
its
rhythm
for
the
moment
he
forgot
the
people
forgot
his
rage
his
agitation
of
the
previous
hour
he
remembered
only
that
he
had
written
a
great
poem
then
doubt
intruded
after
all
was
it
so
great
did
not
its
sublimity
overpass
a
little
the
bounds
of
the
ridiculous
had
he
seen
true
had
he
failed
again
he
the
poem
carefully
and
it
seemed
all
at
once
to
lose
force
by
now
presley
could
not
tell
whether
what
he
had
written
was
true
poetry
or
doggerel
he
distrusted
profoundly
his
own
judgment
he
must
have
the
opinion
of
some
one
else
some
one
competent
to
judge
he
could
not
wait
would
not
do
he
must
know
to
a
certainty
before
he
could
rest
that
night
he
made
a
careful
copy
of
what
he
had
written
and
putting
on
his
hat
and
laced
boots
went
down
stairs
and
out
upon
the
lawn
crossing
over
to
the
stables
he
found
phelps
there
washing
down
the
buckboard
do
you
know
where
vanamee
is
he
asked
the
latter
phelps
put
his
chin
in
the
air
ask
me
something
easy
he
responded
he
might
be
at
guadalajara
or
he
might
be
up
at
osterman
or
he
might
be
a
hundred
miles
away
from
either
place
i
know
where
he
ought
to
be
presley
but
that
saying
where
the
crazy
gesabe
is
he
ought
to
be
over
east
of
four
at
the
head
waters
of
mission
i
try
for
him
there
at
all
events
answered
presley
if
you
see
harran
when
he
comes
in
tell
him
i
may
not
be
back
in
time
for
presley
found
the
pony
in
the
corral
cinched
the
saddle
upon
him
and
went
off
over
the
lower
road
going
eastward
at
a
brisk
canter
at
hooven
he
called
a
how
do
you
do
to
minna
whom
he
saw
lying
in
a
slat
hammock
under
the
mammoth
live
oak
her
foot
in
bandages
and
then
galloped
on
over
the
bridge
across
the
irrigating
ditch
wondering
vaguely
what
would
become
of
such
a
pretty
girl
as
minna
and
if
in
the
end
she
would
marry
the
portuguese
foreman
in
charge
of
the
he
told
himself
that
he
hoped
she
would
and
that
speedily
there
was
no
lack
of
comment
as
to
minna
hooven
about
the
ranches
certainly
she
was
a
good
girl
but
she
was
seen
at
all
hours
here
and
there
about
bonneville
and
guadalajara
skylarking
with
the
portuguese
farm
hands
of
quien
sabe
and
los
muertos
she
was
very
pretty
the
men
made
fools
of
themselves
over
her
presley
hoped
they
would
not
end
by
making
a
fool
of
her
just
beyond
the
irrigating
ditch
presley
left
the
lower
road
and
following
a
trail
that
branched
off
southeasterly
from
this
point
held
on
across
the
fourth
division
of
the
ranch
keeping
the
mission
creek
on
his
left
a
few
miles
farther
on
he
went
through
a
gate
in
a
barbed
wire
fence
and
at
once
engaged
himself
in
a
system
of
little
arroyos
and
low
rolling
hills
that
steadily
lifted
and
increased
in
size
as
he
proceeded
this
higher
ground
was
the
advance
guard
of
the
sierra
foothills
and
served
as
the
stock
range
for
los
muertos
the
hills
were
huge
rolling
hummocks
of
bare
ground
covered
only
by
wild
oats
at
long
intervals
were
isolated
live
oaks
in
the
canyons
and
arroyos
the
chaparral
and
manzanita
grew
in
dark
thickets
the
ground
was
with
and
the
gophers
themselves
were
everywhere
occasionally
a
jack
rabbit
bounded
across
the
open
from
one
growth
of
chaparral
to
another
taking
long
leaps
his
ears
erect
high
overhead
a
hawk
or
two
swung
at
anchor
and
once
with
a
startling
rush
of
wings
a
covey
of
quail
flushed
from
the
brush
at
the
side
of
the
trail
on
the
hillsides
in
thinly
scattered
groups
were
the
cattle
grazing
deliberately
working
slowly
toward
the
for
their
evening
drink
the
horses
keeping
to
themselves
the
colts
nuzzling
at
their
mothers
bellies
whisking
their
tails
stamping
their
unshod
feet
but
once
in
a
remoter
field
solitary
magnificent
enormous
the
short
hair
curling
tight
upon
his
forehead
his
small
red
eyes
twinkling
his
vast
neck
heavy
with
muscles
presley
came
upon
the
monarch
the
king
the
great
durham
bull
maintaining
his
lonely
state
unapproachable
austere
presley
found
the
shepherd
by
a
in
a
far
distant
corner
of
the
range
he
had
made
his
simple
camp
for
the
night
his
army
blanket
lay
spread
under
a
live
oak
his
horse
grazed
near
at
hand
he
himself
sat
on
his
heels
before
a
little
fire
of
dead
manzanita
roots
cooking
his
coffee
and
bacon
never
had
presley
conceived
so
keen
an
impression
of
loneliness
as
his
crouching
figure
presented
the
bald
bare
landscape
widened
about
him
to
infinity
vanamee
was
a
spot
in
it
all
a
tiny
dot
a
single
atom
of
human
organisation
floating
endlessly
on
the
ocean
of
an
illimitable
nature
the
two
friends
ate
together
and
vanamee
having
snared
a
brace
of
quails
dressed
and
then
roasted
them
on
a
sharpened
stick
after
eating
they
drank
great
refreshing
draughts
from
the
then
at
length
presley
having
lit
his
cigarette
and
vanamee
his
pipe
the
former
said
vanamee
i
have
been
writing
vanamee
turned
his
lean
ascetic
face
toward
him
his
black
eyes
fixed
attentively
i
know
he
said
your
no
this
is
a
poem
you
remember
i
told
you
about
it
once
toilers
i
called
oh
verse
well
i
am
glad
you
have
gone
back
to
it
it
is
your
natural
you
remember
the
poem
asked
presley
it
was
yes
i
remember
it
there
was
better
promise
in
it
than
anything
you
ever
wrote
now
i
suppose
you
have
finished
without
reply
presley
brought
it
from
out
the
breast
pocket
of
his
shooting
coat
the
moment
seemed
propitious
the
stillness
of
the
vast
bare
hills
was
profound
the
sun
was
setting
in
a
cloudless
brazier
of
red
light
a
golden
dust
pervaded
all
the
landscape
presley
read
his
poem
aloud
when
he
had
finished
his
friend
looked
at
him
what
have
you
been
doing
lately
he
demanded
presley
wondering
told
of
his
various
comings
and
goings
i
do
mean
that
returned
the
other
something
has
happened
to
you
something
has
aroused
you
i
am
right
am
i
not
yes
i
thought
so
in
this
poem
of
yours
you
have
not
been
trying
to
make
a
sounding
piece
of
literature
you
wrote
it
under
tremendous
stress
its
very
imperfections
show
that
it
is
better
than
a
mere
rhyme
it
is
an
utterance
a
message
it
is
truth
you
have
come
back
to
the
primal
heart
of
things
and
you
have
seen
clearly
yes
it
is
a
great
thank
you
exclaimed
presley
fervidly
i
had
begun
to
mistrust
now
observed
vanamee
i
presume
you
will
rush
it
into
print
to
have
formulated
a
great
thought
simply
to
have
accomplished
is
not
i
think
i
am
sincere
objected
presley
if
it
is
good
it
will
do
good
to
others
you
said
yourself
it
was
a
message
if
it
has
any
value
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
right
to
keep
it
back
from
even
a
very
small
and
most
indifferent
do
publish
it
in
the
magazines
at
all
events
vanamee
answered
your
inspiration
has
come
from
the
people
then
let
it
go
straight
to
the
people
not
the
literary
readers
of
the
monthly
periodicals
the
rich
who
would
only
be
indirectly
interested
if
you
must
publish
it
let
it
be
in
the
daily
press
do
interrupt
i
know
what
you
will
say
it
will
be
that
the
daily
press
is
common
is
vulgar
is
undignified
and
i
tell
you
that
such
a
poem
as
this
of
yours
called
as
it
is
toilers
must
be
read
by
the
toilers
it
must
be
common
it
must
be
vulgarised
you
must
not
stand
upon
your
dignity
with
the
people
if
you
are
to
reach
that
is
true
i
suppose
presley
admitted
but
i
ca
get
rid
of
the
idea
that
it
would
be
throwing
my
poem
away
the
great
magazine
gives
me
such
a
background
gives
me
such
gives
you
such
weight
gives
you
such
background
is
it
yourself
you
think
of
you
helper
of
the
helpless
is
that
your
sincerity
you
must
sink
yourself
must
forget
yourself
and
your
own
desire
of
fame
of
admitted
success
it
is
your
poem
your
message
that
must
prevail
not
you
who
wrote
it
you
preach
a
doctrine
of
abnegation
of
and
you
sign
your
name
to
your
words
as
high
on
the
tablets
as
you
can
reach
so
that
all
the
world
may
see
not
the
poem
but
the
poet
presley
there
are
many
like
you
the
social
reformer
writes
a
book
on
the
iniquity
of
the
possession
of
land
and
out
of
the
proceeds
buys
a
corner
lot
the
economist
who
laments
the
hardships
of
the
poor
allows
himself
to
grow
rich
upon
the
sale
of
his
but
presley
would
hear
no
further
no
he
cried
i
know
i
am
sincere
and
to
prove
it
to
you
i
will
publish
my
poem
as
you
say
in
the
daily
press
and
i
will
accept
no
money
for
they
talked
on
for
about
an
hour
while
the
evening
wore
away
presley
very
soon
noticed
that
vanamee
was
again
preoccupied
more
than
ever
of
late
his
silence
his
brooding
had
increased
by
and
by
he
rose
abruptly
turning
his
head
to
the
north
in
the
direction
of
the
mission
church
of
san
juan
i
think
he
said
to
presley
that
i
must
be
going
where
to
at
this
time
of
night
off
vanamee
made
an
uncertain
gesture
toward
the
north
and
without
another
word
he
disappeared
in
the
grey
of
the
twilight
presley
was
left
alone
wondering
he
found
his
horse
and
tightening
the
girths
mounted
and
rode
home
under
the
sheen
of
the
stars
thoughtful
his
head
bowed
before
he
went
to
bed
that
night
he
sent
the
toilers
to
the
sunday
editor
of
a
daily
newspaper
in
san
francisco
upon
leaving
presley
vanamee
his
thumbs
hooked
into
his
empty
cartridge
belt
strode
swiftly
down
from
the
hills
of
the
los
muertos
and
on
through
the
silent
town
of
guadalajara
his
lean
swarthy
face
with
its
hollow
cheeks
fine
black
pointed
beard
and
sad
eyes
was
set
to
the
northward
as
was
his
custom
he
was
bareheaded
and
the
rapidity
of
his
stride
made
a
breeze
in
his
long
black
hair
he
knew
where
he
was
going
he
knew
what
he
must
live
through
that
night
again
the
deathless
grief
that
never
slept
leaped
out
of
the
shadows
and
fastened
upon
his
shoulders
it
was
scourging
him
back
to
that
scene
of
a
vanished
happiness
a
dead
romance
a
perished
idyl
the
mission
garden
in
the
shade
of
the
venerable
pear
trees
but
besides
this
other
influences
tugged
at
his
heart
there
was
a
mystery
in
the
garden
in
that
spot
the
night
was
not
always
empty
the
darkness
not
always
silent
something
far
off
stirred
and
listened
to
his
cry
at
times
drawing
nearer
to
him
at
first
this
presence
had
been
a
matter
for
terror
but
of
late
as
he
felt
it
gradually
drawing
nearer
the
terror
had
at
long
intervals
given
place
to
a
feeling
of
an
almost
ineffable
sweetness
but
distrusting
his
own
senses
unwilling
to
submit
himself
to
such
torturing
uncertain
happiness
averse
to
the
terrible
confusion
of
spirit
that
followed
upon
a
night
spent
in
the
garden
vanamee
had
tried
to
keep
away
from
the
place
however
when
the
sorrow
of
his
life
reassailed
him
and
the
thoughts
and
recollections
of
angele
brought
the
ache
into
his
heart
and
the
tears
to
his
eyes
the
temptation
to
return
to
the
garden
invariably
gripped
him
close
there
were
times
when
he
could
not
resist
of
themselves
his
footsteps
turned
in
that
direction
it
was
almost
as
if
he
himself
had
been
called
guadalajara
was
silent
dark
not
even
in
solotari
was
there
a
light
the
town
was
asleep
only
the
inevitable
guitar
hummed
from
an
unseen
vanamee
pushed
on
the
smell
of
the
fields
and
open
country
and
a
distant
scent
of
flowers
that
he
knew
well
came
to
his
nostrils
as
he
emerged
from
the
town
by
way
of
the
road
that
led
on
towards
the
mission
through
quien
sabe
on
either
side
of
him
lay
the
brown
earth
silently
nurturing
the
implanted
seed
two
days
before
it
had
rained
copiously
and
the
soil
still
moist
disengaged
a
pungent
aroma
of
fecundity
vanamee
following
the
road
passed
through
the
collection
of
buildings
of
annixter
home
ranch
everything
slept
at
intervals
the
on
the
artesian
well
creaked
audibly
as
it
turned
in
a
languid
breeze
from
the
northeast
a
cat
hunting
crept
from
the
shadow
of
the
gigantic
barn
and
paused
uncertainly
in
the
open
the
tip
of
her
tail
twitching
from
within
the
barn
itself
came
the
sound
of
the
friction
of
a
heavy
body
and
a
stir
of
hoofs
as
one
of
the
dozing
cows
lay
down
with
a
long
breath
vanamee
left
the
ranch
house
behind
him
and
proceeded
on
his
way
beyond
him
to
the
right
of
the
road
he
could
make
out
the
higher
ground
in
the
mission
enclosure
and
the
watching
tower
of
the
mission
itself
the
minutes
passed
he
went
steadily
forward
then
abruptly
he
paused
his
head
in
the
air
eye
and
ear
alert
to
that
strange
sixth
sense
of
his
responsive
as
the
leaves
of
the
sensitive
plant
had
suddenly
come
the
impression
of
a
human
being
near
at
hand
he
had
neither
seen
nor
heard
but
for
all
that
he
stopped
an
instant
in
his
tracks
then
the
sensation
confirmed
went
on
again
with
slow
steps
advancing
warily
at
last
his
swiftly
roving
eyes
lighted
upon
an
object
just
darker
than
the
of
the
land
it
was
at
some
distance
from
the
roadside
vanamee
approached
it
cautiously
leaving
the
road
treading
carefully
upon
the
moist
clods
of
earth
underfoot
twenty
paces
distant
he
halted
annixter
was
there
seated
upon
a
round
white
rock
his
back
towards
him
he
was
leaning
forward
his
elbows
on
his
knees
his
chin
in
his
hands
he
did
not
move
silent
motionless
he
gazed
out
upon
the
flat
sombre
land
it
was
the
night
wherein
the
master
of
quien
sabe
wrought
out
his
salvation
struggling
with
self
from
dusk
to
dawn
at
the
moment
when
vanamee
came
upon
him
the
turmoil
within
him
had
only
begun
the
heart
of
the
man
had
not
yet
wakened
the
night
was
young
the
dawn
far
distant
and
all
around
him
the
fields
of
upturned
clods
lay
bare
and
brown
empty
of
all
life
unbroken
by
a
single
green
shoot
for
a
moment
the
of
these
two
men
of
so
widely
differing
characters
touched
each
other
there
in
the
silence
of
the
night
under
the
stars
then
silently
vanamee
withdrew
going
on
his
way
wondering
at
the
trouble
that
like
himself
drove
this
hardheaded
man
of
affairs
untroubled
by
dreams
out
into
the
night
to
brood
over
an
empty
land
then
speedily
he
forgot
all
else
the
material
world
drew
off
from
him
reality
dwindled
to
a
point
and
vanished
like
the
vanishing
of
a
star
at
moonrise
earthly
things
dissolved
and
disappeared
as
a
strange
unnamed
essence
flowed
in
upon
him
a
new
atmosphere
for
him
pervaded
his
surroundings
he
entered
the
world
of
the
vision
of
the
legend
of
the
miracle
where
all
things
were
possible
he
stood
at
the
gate
of
the
mission
garden
above
him
rose
the
ancient
tower
of
the
mission
church
through
the
arches
at
its
summit
where
swung
the
spanish
queen
bells
he
saw
the
stars
the
silent
bats
with
flickering
wings
threw
their
dancing
shadows
on
the
pallid
surface
of
the
venerable
facade
not
the
faintest
chirring
of
a
cricket
broke
the
silence
the
bees
were
asleep
in
the
grasses
in
the
trees
deep
in
the
calix
of
punka
flower
and
magnolia
bloom
the
gnats
the
caterpillars
the
beetles
all
the
microscopic
multitudinous
life
of
the
daytime
drowsed
and
dozed
not
even
the
minute
scuffling
of
a
lizard
over
the
warm
worn
pavement
of
the
colonnade
disturbed
the
infinite
repose
the
profound
stillness
only
within
the
garden
the
intermittent
trickling
of
the
fountain
made
itself
heard
flowing
steadily
marking
off
the
lapse
of
seconds
the
progress
of
hours
the
cycle
of
years
the
inevitable
march
of
centuries
at
one
time
the
doorway
before
which
vanamee
now
stood
had
been
hermetically
closed
but
he
himself
had
long
since
changed
that
he
stood
before
it
for
a
moment
steeping
himself
in
the
mystery
and
romance
of
the
place
then
raising
he
latch
pushed
open
the
gate
entered
and
closed
it
softly
behind
him
he
was
in
the
cloister
garden
the
stars
were
out
strewn
thick
and
close
in
the
deep
blue
of
the
sky
the
milky
way
glowing
like
a
silver
veil
ursa
major
wheeled
gigantic
in
the
north
the
great
nebula
in
orion
was
a
whorl
of
shimmering
star
dust
venus
flamed
a
lambent
disk
of
pale
saffron
low
over
the
horizon
from
edge
to
edge
of
the
world
marched
the
constellations
like
the
progress
of
emperors
and
from
the
innumerable
glory
of
their
courses
a
mysterious
sheen
of
diaphanous
light
disengaged
itself
expanding
over
all
the
earth
serene
infinite
majestic
the
little
garden
revealed
itself
but
dimly
beneath
the
brooding
light
only
half
emerging
from
the
shadow
the
polished
surfaces
of
the
leaves
of
the
pear
trees
winked
faintly
back
the
reflected
light
as
the
trees
just
stirred
in
the
uncertain
breeze
a
blurred
shield
of
silver
marked
the
ripples
of
the
fountain
under
the
flood
of
dull
blue
lustre
the
gravelled
walks
lay
vague
amid
the
grasses
like
webs
of
white
satin
on
the
bed
of
a
lake
against
the
eastern
wall
the
headstones
of
the
graves
an
indistinct
procession
of
grey
cowls
ranged
themselves
vanamee
crossed
the
garden
pausing
to
kiss
the
turf
upon
grave
then
he
approached
the
line
of
pear
trees
and
laid
himself
down
in
their
shadow
his
chin
propped
upon
his
hands
his
eyes
wandering
over
the
expanse
of
the
little
valley
that
stretched
away
from
the
foot
of
the
hill
upon
which
the
mission
was
built
once
again
he
summoned
the
vision
once
again
he
conjured
up
the
illusion
once
again
tortured
with
doubt
racked
with
a
deathless
grief
he
craved
an
answer
of
the
night
once
again
mystic
that
he
was
he
sent
his
mind
out
from
him
across
the
enchanted
sea
of
the
supernatural
hope
of
what
he
did
not
know
roused
up
within
him
surely
on
such
a
night
as
this
the
hallucination
must
define
itself
surely
the
manifestation
must
be
vouchsafed
his
eyes
closed
his
will
girding
itself
to
a
supreme
effort
his
senses
exalted
to
a
state
of
pleasing
numbness
he
called
upon
angele
to
come
to
him
his
voiceless
cry
penetrating
far
out
into
that
sea
of
faint
ephemeral
light
that
floated
tideless
over
the
little
valley
beneath
him
then
motionless
prone
upon
the
ground
he
waited
months
had
passed
since
that
first
night
when
at
length
an
answer
had
come
to
vanamee
at
first
startled
out
of
all
composure
troubled
and
stirred
to
his
lowest
depths
because
of
the
very
thing
for
which
he
sought
he
resolved
never
again
to
put
his
strange
powers
to
the
test
but
for
all
that
he
had
come
a
second
night
to
the
garden
and
a
third
and
a
fourth
at
last
his
visits
were
habitual
night
after
night
he
was
there
surrendering
himself
to
the
influences
of
the
place
gradually
convinced
that
something
did
actually
answer
when
he
called
his
faith
increased
as
the
winter
grew
into
spring
as
the
spring
advanced
and
the
nights
became
shorter
it
crystallised
into
certainty
would
he
have
her
again
his
love
long
dead
would
she
come
to
him
once
more
out
of
the
grave
out
of
the
night
he
could
not
tell
he
could
only
hope
all
that
he
knew
was
that
his
cry
found
an
answer
that
his
outstretched
hands
groping
in
the
darkness
met
the
touch
of
other
fingers
patiently
he
waited
the
nights
became
warmer
as
the
spring
drew
on
the
stars
shone
clearer
the
nights
seemed
brighter
for
nearly
a
month
after
the
occasion
of
his
first
answer
nothing
new
occurred
some
nights
it
failed
him
entirely
upon
others
it
was
faint
illusive
then
at
last
the
most
subtle
the
barest
of
perceptible
changes
began
his
groping
mind
there
wandering
like
a
lost
bird
over
the
valley
touched
upon
some
thing
again
touched
and
held
it
and
this
time
drew
it
a
single
step
closer
to
him
his
heart
beating
the
blood
surging
in
his
temples
he
watched
with
the
eyes
of
his
imagination
this
gradual
approach
what
was
coming
to
him
who
was
coming
to
him
shrouded
in
the
obscurity
of
the
night
whose
was
the
face
now
turned
towards
his
whose
the
footsteps
that
with
such
infinite
slowness
drew
nearer
to
where
he
waited
he
did
not
dare
to
say
his
mind
went
back
many
years
to
that
time
before
the
tragedy
of
angele
death
before
the
mystery
of
the
other
he
waited
then
as
he
waited
now
but
then
he
had
not
waited
in
vain
then
as
now
he
had
seemed
to
feel
her
approach
seemed
to
feel
her
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
to
their
rendezvous
now
what
would
happen
he
did
not
know
he
waited
he
waited
hoping
all
things
he
waited
believing
all
things
he
waited
enduring
all
things
he
trusted
in
the
vision
meanwhile
as
spring
advanced
the
flowers
in
the
seed
ranch
began
to
come
to
life
over
the
five
hundred
acres
whereon
the
flowers
were
planted
the
widening
growth
of
vines
and
bushes
spread
like
the
waves
of
a
green
sea
then
timidly
colours
of
the
faintest
tints
began
to
appear
under
the
moonlight
vanamee
saw
them
expanding
delicate
pink
faint
blue
tenderest
variations
of
lavender
and
yellow
white
shimmering
with
reflections
of
gold
all
subdued
and
pallid
in
the
moonlight
by
degrees
the
night
became
impregnated
with
the
perfume
of
the
flowers
illusive
at
first
evanescent
as
filaments
of
gossamer
then
as
the
buds
opened
emphasising
itself
breathing
deeper
stronger
an
exquisite
mingling
of
many
odours
passed
continually
over
the
mission
from
the
garden
of
the
seed
ranch
meeting
and
blending
with
the
aroma
of
its
magnolia
buds
and
punka
blossoms
as
the
colours
of
the
flowers
of
the
seed
ranch
deepened
and
as
their
odours
penetrated
deeper
and
more
distinctly
as
the
starlight
of
each
succeeding
night
grew
brighter
and
the
air
became
warmer
the
illusion
defined
itself
by
imperceptible
degrees
as
vanamee
waited
under
the
shadows
of
the
pear
trees
the
answer
grew
nearer
and
nearer
he
saw
nothing
but
the
distant
glimmer
of
the
flowers
he
heard
nothing
but
the
drip
of
the
fountain
nothing
moved
about
him
but
the
invisible
breaths
of
perfume
yet
he
felt
the
approach
of
the
vision
it
came
first
to
about
the
middle
of
the
seed
ranch
itself
some
half
a
mile
away
where
the
violets
grew
shrinking
timid
flowers
hiding
close
to
the
ground
then
it
passed
forward
beyond
the
violets
and
drew
nearer
and
stood
amid
the
mignonette
hardier
blooms
that
dared
look
heavenward
from
out
the
leaves
a
few
nights
later
it
left
the
mignonette
behind
and
advanced
into
the
beds
of
white
iris
that
pushed
more
boldly
forth
from
the
earth
their
waxen
petals
claiming
the
attention
it
advanced
then
a
long
step
into
the
proud
challenging
beauty
of
the
carnations
and
roses
and
at
last
after
many
nights
vanamee
felt
that
it
paused
as
if
trembling
at
its
hardihood
full
in
the
superb
glory
of
the
royal
lilies
themselves
that
grew
on
the
extreme
border
of
the
seed
ranch
nearest
to
him
after
this
there
was
a
certain
long
wait
then
upon
a
dark
midnight
it
advanced
again
vanamee
could
scarcely
repress
a
cry
now
the
illusion
emerged
from
the
flowers
it
stood
not
distant
but
unseen
almost
at
the
base
of
the
hill
upon
whose
crest
he
waited
in
a
depression
of
the
ground
where
the
shadows
lay
thickest
it
was
nearly
within
earshot
the
nights
passed
the
spring
grew
warmer
in
the
daytime
intermittent
rains
freshened
all
the
earth
the
flowers
of
the
seed
ranch
grew
rapidly
bud
after
bud
burst
forth
while
those
already
opened
expanded
to
full
maturity
the
colour
of
the
seed
ranch
deepened
one
night
after
hours
of
waiting
vanamee
felt
upon
his
cheek
the
touch
of
a
prolonged
puff
of
warm
wind
breathing
across
the
little
valley
from
out
the
east
it
reached
the
mission
garden
and
stirred
the
branches
of
the
pear
trees
it
seemed
veritably
to
be
compounded
of
the
very
essence
of
the
flowers
never
had
the
aroma
been
so
sweet
so
pervasive
it
passed
and
faded
leaving
in
its
wake
an
absolute
silence
then
at
length
the
silence
of
the
night
that
silence
to
which
vanamee
had
so
long
appealed
was
broken
by
a
tiny
sound
alert
from
the
ground
he
listened
for
now
at
length
he
heard
something
the
sound
repeated
itself
it
came
from
near
at
hand
from
the
thick
shadow
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
what
it
was
he
could
not
tell
but
it
did
not
belong
to
a
single
one
of
the
infinite
similar
noises
of
the
place
with
which
he
was
so
familiar
it
was
neither
the
rustle
of
a
leaf
the
snap
of
a
parted
twig
the
drone
of
an
insect
the
dropping
of
a
magnolia
blossom
it
was
a
vibration
merely
faint
elusive
impossible
of
definition
a
minute
notch
in
the
fine
keen
edge
of
stillness
again
the
nights
passed
the
summer
stars
became
brighter
the
warmth
increased
the
flowers
of
the
seed
ranch
grew
still
more
the
five
hundred
acres
of
the
ranch
were
carpeted
with
them
at
length
upon
a
certain
midnight
a
new
light
began
to
spread
in
the
sky
the
thin
scimitar
of
the
moon
rose
veiled
and
dim
behind
the
the
light
increased
distant
objects
until
now
hidden
came
into
view
and
as
the
radiance
brightened
vanamee
looking
down
upon
the
little
valley
saw
a
spectacle
of
incomparable
beauty
all
the
buds
of
the
seed
ranch
had
opened
the
faint
tints
of
the
flowers
had
deepened
had
asserted
themselves
they
challenged
the
eye
pink
became
a
royal
red
blue
rose
into
purple
yellow
flamed
into
orange
orange
glowed
golden
and
brilliant
the
earth
disappeared
under
great
bands
and
fields
of
resplendent
colour
then
at
length
the
moon
abruptly
soared
zenithward
from
out
the
veiling
mist
passing
from
one
filmy
haze
to
another
for
a
moment
there
was
a
gleam
of
a
golden
light
and
vanamee
his
eyes
searching
the
shade
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
felt
his
heart
suddenly
leap
and
then
hang
poised
refusing
to
beat
in
that
instant
of
passing
light
something
had
caught
his
eye
something
that
moved
down
there
half
in
and
half
out
of
the
shadow
at
the
hill
foot
it
had
come
and
gone
in
an
instant
the
haze
once
more
screened
the
moonlight
the
shade
again
engulfed
the
vision
what
was
it
he
had
seen
he
did
not
know
so
brief
had
been
that
movement
the
drowsy
brain
had
not
been
quick
enough
to
interpret
the
cipher
message
of
the
eye
now
it
was
gone
but
something
had
been
there
he
had
seen
it
was
it
the
lifting
of
a
strand
of
hair
the
wave
of
a
white
hand
the
flutter
of
a
garment
edge
he
could
not
tell
but
it
did
not
belong
to
any
of
those
sights
which
he
had
seen
so
often
in
that
place
it
was
neither
the
glancing
of
a
moth
wing
the
nodding
of
a
blossom
nor
the
noiseless
flitting
of
a
bat
it
was
a
gleam
merely
faint
elusive
impossible
of
definition
an
intangible
agitation
in
the
vast
dim
blur
of
the
darkness
and
that
was
all
until
now
no
single
real
thing
had
occurred
nothing
that
vanamee
could
reduce
to
terms
of
actuality
nothing
he
could
put
into
words
the
manifestation
when
not
recognisable
to
that
strange
sixth
sense
of
his
appealed
only
to
the
most
refined
the
most
delicate
perception
of
eye
and
ear
it
was
all
ephemeral
filmy
dreamy
the
mystic
forming
of
the
vision
the
invisible
developing
a
concrete
nucleus
the
starlight
coagulating
the
radiance
of
the
flowers
thickening
to
something
actual
perfume
the
most
delicious
fragrance
becoming
a
tangible
presence
but
into
that
garden
the
serpent
intruded
though
cradled
in
the
slow
rhythm
of
the
dream
lulled
by
this
beauty
of
a
summer
night
heavy
with
the
scent
of
flowers
the
silence
broken
only
by
a
rippling
fountain
the
darkness
illuminated
by
a
world
of
radiant
blossoms
vanamee
could
not
forget
the
tragedy
of
the
other
that
terror
of
many
years
ago
that
prowler
of
the
night
that
strange
fearful
figure
with
the
unseen
face
swooping
in
there
from
out
the
darkness
gone
in
an
instant
yet
leaving
behind
the
trail
and
trace
of
death
and
of
pollution
never
had
vanamee
seen
this
more
clearly
than
when
leaving
presley
on
the
stock
range
of
los
muertos
he
had
come
across
to
the
mission
garden
by
way
of
the
quien
sabe
ranch
it
was
the
same
night
in
which
annixter
the
stars
coming
at
last
to
himself
as
the
hours
passed
the
two
men
far
apart
ignoring
each
other
waited
for
the
manifestation
annixter
on
the
ranch
vanamee
in
the
garden
prone
upon
his
face
under
the
pear
trees
his
forehead
buried
in
the
hollow
of
his
arm
vanamee
lay
motionless
for
the
last
time
raising
his
head
he
sent
his
voiceless
cry
out
into
the
night
across
the
levels
of
the
little
valley
calling
upon
the
miracle
summoning
the
darkness
to
give
angele
back
to
him
resigning
himself
to
the
hallucination
he
bowed
his
head
upon
his
arm
again
and
waited
the
minutes
passed
the
fountain
dripped
steadily
over
the
hills
a
haze
of
saffron
light
foretold
the
rising
of
the
full
moon
nothing
stirred
the
silence
was
profound
then
abruptly
vanamee
right
hand
shut
tight
upon
his
wrist
there
there
it
was
it
began
again
his
invocation
was
answered
far
off
there
the
ripple
formed
again
upon
the
still
black
pool
of
the
night
no
sound
no
sight
vibration
merely
appreciable
by
some
sublimated
faculty
of
the
mind
as
yet
unnamed
rigid
his
nerves
taut
motionless
prone
on
the
ground
he
waited
it
advanced
with
infinite
slowness
now
it
passed
through
the
beds
of
violets
now
through
the
mignonette
a
moment
later
and
he
knew
it
stood
among
the
white
iris
then
it
left
those
behind
it
was
in
the
splendour
of
the
red
roses
and
carnations
it
passed
like
a
moving
star
into
the
superb
abundance
the
imperial
opulence
of
the
royal
lilies
it
was
advancing
slowly
but
there
was
no
pause
he
held
his
breath
not
daring
to
raise
his
head
it
passed
beyond
the
limits
of
the
seed
ranch
and
entered
the
shade
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
below
him
would
it
come
farther
than
this
here
it
had
always
stopped
hitherto
stopped
for
a
moment
and
then
in
spite
of
his
efforts
had
slipped
from
his
grasp
and
faded
back
into
the
night
but
now
he
wondered
if
he
had
been
willing
to
put
forth
his
utmost
strength
after
all
had
there
not
always
been
an
element
of
dread
in
the
thought
of
beholding
the
mystery
face
to
face
had
he
not
even
allowed
the
vision
to
dissolve
the
answer
to
recede
into
the
obscurity
whence
it
came
but
never
a
night
had
been
so
beautiful
as
this
it
was
the
full
period
of
the
spring
the
air
was
a
veritable
caress
the
infinite
repose
of
the
little
garden
sleeping
under
the
night
was
delicious
beyond
expression
it
was
a
tiny
corner
of
the
world
shut
off
discreet
distilling
romance
a
garden
of
dreams
of
enchantments
below
in
the
little
valley
the
resplendent
colourations
of
the
million
flowers
roses
lilies
hyacinths
carnations
violets
glowed
like
incandescence
in
the
golden
light
of
the
rising
moon
the
air
was
thick
with
the
perfume
heavy
with
it
clogged
with
it
the
sweetness
filled
the
very
mouth
the
throat
choked
with
it
overhead
wheeled
the
illimitable
procession
of
the
constellations
underfoot
the
earth
was
asleep
the
very
flowers
were
dreaming
a
cathedral
hush
overlay
all
the
land
and
a
sense
of
benediction
brooded
low
a
divine
kindliness
manifesting
itself
in
beauty
in
peace
in
absolute
repose
it
was
a
time
for
visions
it
was
the
hour
when
dreams
come
true
and
lying
deep
in
the
grasses
beneath
the
pear
trees
vanamee
dizzied
with
mysticism
reaching
up
and
out
toward
the
supernatural
felt
as
it
were
his
mind
begin
to
rise
upward
from
out
his
body
he
passed
into
a
state
of
being
the
like
of
which
he
had
not
known
before
he
felt
that
his
imagination
was
reshaping
itself
preparing
to
receive
an
impression
never
experienced
until
now
his
body
felt
light
to
him
then
it
dwindled
vanished
he
saw
with
new
eyes
heard
with
new
ears
felt
with
a
new
heart
come
to
me
he
murmured
then
slowly
he
felt
the
advance
of
the
vision
it
was
approaching
every
instant
it
drew
gradually
nearer
at
last
he
was
to
see
it
had
left
the
shadow
at
the
base
of
the
hill
it
was
on
the
hill
itself
slowly
steadily
it
ascended
the
slope
just
below
him
there
he
heard
a
faint
stirring
the
grasses
rustled
under
the
touch
of
a
foot
the
leaves
of
the
bushes
murmured
as
a
hand
brushed
against
them
a
slender
twig
creaked
the
sounds
of
approach
were
more
distinct
they
came
nearer
they
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
they
were
within
whispering
distance
vanamee
trembling
kept
his
head
buried
in
his
arm
the
sounds
at
length
paused
definitely
the
vision
could
come
no
nearer
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
the
moon
had
risen
its
great
shield
of
gold
stood
over
the
eastern
horizon
within
six
feet
of
vanamee
clear
and
distinct
against
the
disk
of
the
moon
stood
the
figure
of
a
young
girl
she
was
dressed
in
a
gown
of
scarlet
silk
with
flowing
sleeves
such
as
japanese
wear
embroidered
with
flowers
and
figures
of
birds
worked
in
gold
threads
on
either
side
of
her
face
making
her
round
white
forehead
hung
the
soft
masses
of
her
hair
of
gold
her
hands
hung
limply
at
her
sides
but
from
between
her
parted
lips
lips
of
almost
an
egyptian
fulness
her
breath
came
slow
and
regular
and
her
eyes
heavy
lidded
slanting
upwards
toward
the
temples
perplexing
oriental
were
closed
she
was
asleep
from
out
this
life
of
flowers
this
world
of
colour
this
atmosphere
oppressive
with
perfume
this
darkness
clogged
and
cloyed
and
thickened
with
sweet
odours
she
came
to
him
she
came
to
him
from
out
of
the
flowers
the
smell
of
the
roses
in
her
hair
of
gold
the
aroma
and
the
imperial
red
of
the
carnations
in
her
lips
the
whiteness
of
the
lilies
the
perfume
of
the
lilies
and
the
lilies
slender
balancing
grace
in
her
neck
her
hands
disengaged
the
scent
of
the
heliotrope
the
folds
of
her
scarlet
gown
gave
off
the
enervating
smell
of
poppies
her
feet
were
redolent
of
hyacinth
she
stood
before
him
a
vision
realised
a
dream
come
true
she
emerged
from
out
the
invisible
he
beheld
her
a
figure
of
gold
and
pale
vermilion
redolent
of
perfume
poised
motionless
in
the
faint
saffron
sheen
of
the
moon
she
a
creation
of
sleep
was
herself
asleep
she
a
dream
was
herself
dreaming
called
forth
from
out
the
darkness
from
the
grip
of
the
earth
the
embrace
of
the
grave
from
out
the
memory
of
corruption
she
rose
into
light
and
life
divinely
pure
across
that
white
forehead
was
no
smudge
no
trace
of
an
earthly
pollution
no
mark
of
a
terrestrial
dishonour
he
saw
in
her
the
same
beauty
of
untainted
innocence
he
had
known
in
his
youth
years
had
made
no
difference
with
her
she
was
still
young
it
was
the
old
purity
that
returned
the
deathless
beauty
the
life
the
eternal
consecrated
and
immortal
youth
for
a
few
seconds
she
stood
there
before
him
and
he
upon
the
ground
at
her
feet
looked
up
at
her
spellbound
then
slowly
she
withdrew
still
asleep
her
eyelids
closed
she
turned
from
him
descending
the
slope
she
was
gone
vanamee
started
up
coming
as
it
were
to
himself
looking
wildly
about
him

the
priest
it

she

walked
as

in
a
trance
pushing
by
sarria
going
forth
from
the
garden

all

suddenly
the
dawn
came
the
east
burned
roseate
toward
the
zenith
vanamee
walked
on
he
knew
not
where
the
dawn
grew
brighter
at
length
he
paused
upon
the
crest
of
a
hill
overlooking
the
ranchos
and
cast
his
eye
below
him
to
the
southward
then
suddenly
flinging
up
his
arms
he
uttered
a
great
cry
there
it
was
the
wheat
the
wheat
in
the
night
it
had
come
up
it
was
there
everywhere
from
margin
to
margin
of
the
horizon
the
earth
long
empty
teemed
with
green
life
once
more
the
pendulum
of
the

swung
in
its
mighty
arc
from
death
back
to
life

out
of
death

rising
from
out

there

the

not
the

but
the
proof
of
immortality

rotting

in

had
an
enormous
success
the
editor
of
the
sunday
supplement
of
the
san
francisco
paper
to
which
it
was
sent
printed
it
in
gothic
type
with
a
title
so
decorative
as
to
be
almost
illegible
and
furthermore
caused
the
poem
to
be
illustrated
by
one
of
the
paper
staff
artists
in
a
most
impressive
fashion
the
whole
affair
occupied
an
entire
page
thus
advertised
the
poem
attracted
attention

was
promptly
copied
in
new
york
boston
and
chicago
papers
it
was
discussed
attacked
defended
eulogised
ridiculed
it
was
praised
with
the
most
fulsome
adulation
assailed
with
the
most
violent
condemnation
editorials
were
written
upon
it

articles
in

its
rhetoric
and
prosody
the
phrases
were
quoted
were
used
as
texts
for
revolutionary

reactionary
speeches
it
was
parodied
it
was
distorted

as
to
read
as
an
advertisement
for
patented

and
infants
foods
finally
the
editor
of
an
enterprising
monthly
magazine
reprinted
the
poem

it
by
a
photograph
and
biography
of
presley
himself
presley
was
stunned
bewildered
he
began
to
wonder
at
himself
was
he
actually
the
greatest
american
poet
since
bryant
he
had
had
no
thought
of
fame
while
composing
the
he
had
only
been
moved
to
his
heart
foundations
thoroughly
in
earnest
seeing
clearly
and
had
addressed
himself
to
the
poem
composition
in
a
happy
moment
when
words
came
easily
to
him
and
the
elaboration
of
fine
sentences
was
not
difficult
was
it
thus
fame
was
achieved
for
a
while
he
was
tempted
to
cross
the
continent
and
go
to
new
york
and
there
come
unto
his
own
enjoying
the
triumph
that
awaited
him
but
soon
he
denied
himself
this
cheap
reward
now
he
was
too
much
in
earnest
he
wanted
to
help
his
people
the
community
in
which
he
lived
the
little
world
of
the
san
joaquin
at
grapples
with
the
railroad
the
struggle
had
found
its
poet
he
told
himself
that
his
place
was
here
only
the
words
of
the
manager
of
a
lecture
bureau
troubled
him
for
a
moment
to
range
the
entire
nation
telling
all
his
countrymen
of
the
drama
that
was
working
itself
out
on
this
fringe
of
the
continent
this
ignored
and
distant
pacific
coast
rousing
their
interest
and
stirring
them
up
to
action
appealed
to
him
it
might
do
great
good
to
devote
himself
to
the
cause
accepting
no
penny
of
remuneration
to
give
his
life
to
loosing
the
grip
of
the
monster
of
steel
and
steam
would
be
beyond
question
heroic
other
states
than
california
had
their
grievances
all
over
the
country
the
family
of
cyclops
was
growing
he
would
declare
himself
the
champion
of
the
people
in
their
opposition
to
the
trust
he
would
be
an
apostle
a
prophet
a
martyr
of
freedom
but
presley
was
essentially
a
dreamer
not
a
man
of
affairs
he
hesitated
to
act
at
this
precise
psychological
moment
striking
while
the
iron
was
yet
hot
and
while
he
hesitated
other
affairs
near
at
hand
began
to
absorb
his
attention
one
night
about
an
hour
after
he
had
gone
to
bed
he
was
awakened
by
the
sound
of
voices
on
the
porch
of
the
ranch
house
and
descending
found
dyke
there
with
sidney
the
mother
was
talking
to
magnus
and
harran
and
crying
as
she
talked
it
seemed
that
dyke
was
missing
he
had
gone
into
town
early
that
afternoon
with
the
wagon
and
team
and
was
to
have
been
home
for
supper
by
now
it
was
ten
and
there
was
no
news
of
him
dyke
told
how
she
first
had
gone
to
quien
sabe
intending
to
telephone
from
there
to
bonneville
but
annixter
was
in
san
francisco
and
in
his
absence
the
house
was
locked
up
and
the
who
had
a
duplicate
key
was
himself
in
bonneville
she
had
telegraphed
three
times
from
guadalajara
to
bonneville
for
news
of
her
son
but
without
result
then
at
last
tortured
with
anxiety
she
had
gone
to
hooven
taking
sidney
with
her
and
had
prevailed
upon
bismarck
to
hitch
up
and
drive
her
across
los
muertos
to
the
governor
to
beg
him
to
telephone
into
bonneville
to
know
what
had
become
of
dyke
while
harran
rang
up
central
in
town
dyke
told
presley
and
magnus
of
the
lamentable
change
in
dyke
they
have
broken
my
son
spirit
derrick
she
said
if
you
were
only
there
to
see
hour
after
hour
he
sits
on
the
porch
with
his
hands
lying
open
in
his
lap
looking
at
them
without
a
word
he
wo
look
me
in
the
face
any
more
and
he
do
sleep
night
after
night
he
has
walked
the
floor
until
morning
and
he
will
go
on
that
way
for
days
together
very
silent
without
a
word
and
sitting
still
in
his
chair
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
will
break
out
oh
derrick
it
is
terrible
into
an
awful
rage
cursing
swearing
grinding
his
teeth
his
hands
clenched
over
his
head
stamping
so
that
the
house
shakes
and
saying
that
if
behrman
do
give
him
back
his
money
he
will
kill
him
with
his
two
hands
but
that
is
the
worst
derrick
he
goes
to
caraher
saloon
now
and
stays
there
for
hours
and
listens
to
caraher
there
is
something
on
my
son
mind
i
know
there
is
something
that
he
and
caraher
have
talked
over
together
and
i
ca
find
out
what
it
is
caraher
is
a
bad
man
and
my
son
has
fallen
under
his
the
tears
filled
her
eyes
bravely
she
turned
to
hide
them
turning
away
to
take
sidney
in
her
arms
putting
her
head
upon
the
little
girl
shoulder
i
i
have
broken
down
before
derrick
she
said
but
after
we
have
been
so
happy
in
our
little
house
just
us
three
and
the
future
seemed
so
bright
oh
god
will
punish
the
gentlemen
who
own
the
railroad
for
being
so
hard
and
harran
came
out
on
the
porch
from
the
telephone
and
she
interrupted
herself
fixing
her
eyes
eagerly
upon
him
i
think
it
is
all
right
dyke
he
said
reassuringly
we
know
where
he
is
i
believe
you
and
the
little
tad
stay
here
and
hooven
and
i
will
go
after
about
two
hours
later
harran
brought
dyke
back
to
los
muertos
in
hooven
wagon
he
had
found
him
at
caraher
saloon
very
drunk
there
was
nothing
maudlin
about
dyke
drunkenness
in
him
the
alcohol
merely
roused
the
spirit
of
evil
vengeful
reckless
as
the
wagon
passed
out
from
under
the
eucalyptus
trees
about
the
ranch
house
taking
dyke
sidney
and
the
engineer
back
to
the
hop
ranch
presley
leaning
from
his
window
heard
the
latter
remark
caraher
is
right
there
is
only
one
thing
they
listen
to
and
the
following
day
presley
drove
magnus
over
to
guadalajara
to
take
the
train
for
san
francisco
but
after
he
had
said
to
the
governor
he
was
moved
to
go
on
to
the
hop
ranch
to
see
the
condition
of
affairs
in
that
quarter
he
returned
to
los
muertos
overwhelmed
with
sadness
and
trembling
with
anger
the
hop
ranch
that
he
had
last
seen
in
the
full
tide
of
prosperity
was
almost
a
ruin
work
had
evidently
been
abandoned
long
since
weeds
were
already
choking
the
vines
everywhere
the
poles
sagged
and
drooped
many
had
even
fallen
dragging
the
vines
with
them
spreading
them
over
the
ground
in
an
inextricable
tangle
of
dead
leaves
decaying
tendrils
and
snarled
string
the
fence
was
broken
the
unfinished
storehouse
which
never
was
to
see
completion
was
a
lamentable
spectacle
of
gaping
doors
and
windows
a
melancholy
skeleton
last
of
all
presley
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
dyke
himself
seated
in
his
rocking
chair
on
the
porch
his
beard
and
hair
unkempt
motionless
looking
with
vague
eyes
upon
his
hands
that
lay
palm
upwards
and
idle
in
his
lap
magnus
on
his
way
to
san
francisco
was
joined
at
bonneville
by
osterman
upon
seating
himself
in
front
of
the
master
of
los
muertos
in
the
of
the
train
this
latter
pushing
back
his
hat
and
smoothing
his
bald
head
observed
governor
you
look
all
frazeled
out
anything
wrong
these
days
the
other
answered
in
the
negative
but
for
all
that
osterman
was
right
the
governor
had
aged
suddenly
his
former
erectness
was
gone
the
broad
shoulders
stooped
a
little
the
strong
lines
of
his
mouth
were
relaxed
and
his
hand
as
it
clasped
over
the
yellowed
ivory
knob
of
his
cane
had
an
unwonted
tremulousness
not
hitherto
noticeable
but
the
change
in
magnus
was
more
than
physical
at
last
in
the
full
tide
of
power
president
of
the
league
known
and
talked
of
in
every
county
of
the
state
leader
in
a
great
struggle
consulted
deferred
to
as
the
prominent
man
at
length
attaining
that
position
so
long
and
vainly
sought
for
he
yet
found
no
pleasure
in
his
triumph
and
little
but
bitterness
in
life
his
success
had
come
by
devious
methods
had
been
reached
by
obscure
means
he
was
a
briber
he
could
never
forget
that
to
further
his
ends
disinterested
even
philanthropic
as
those
were
he
had
connived
with
knavery
he
the
politician
of
the
old
school
of
such
rigorous
integrity
who
had
abandoned
a
career
rather
than
compromise
with
honesty
at
this
eleventh
hour
involved
and
entrapped
in
the
web
of
a
new
order
of
things
bewildered
by
dexterity
by
his
volubility
and
glibness
goaded
and
harassed
beyond
the
point
of
reason
by
the
aggression
of
the
trust
he
fought
he
had
at
last
failed
he
had
fallen
he
had
given
a
bribe
he
had
thought
that
after
all
this
would
make
but
little
difference
with
him
the
affair
was
known
only
to
osterman
broderson
and
annixter
they
would
not
judge
him
being
themselves
involved
he
could
still
preserve
a
bold
front
could
still
hold
his
head
high
as
time
went
on
the
affair
would
lose
its
point
but
this
was
not
so
some
subtle
element
of
his
character
had
forsaken
him
he
felt
it
he
knew
it
some
certain
stiffness
that
had
given
him
all
his
rigidity
that
had
lent
force
to
his
authority
weight
to
his
dominance
temper
to
his
fine
inflexible
hardness
was
diminishing
day
by
day
in
the
decisions
which
he
as
president
of
the
league
was
called
upon
to
make
so
often
he
now
hesitated
he
could
no
longer
be
arrogant
masterful
acting
upon
his
own
judgment
independent
of
opinion
he
began
to
consult
his
lieutenants
asking
their
advice
distrusting
his
own
opinions
he
made
mistakes
blunders
and
when
those
were
brought
to
his
notice
took
refuge
in
bluster
he
knew
it
to
be
bluster
knew
that
sooner
or
later
his
subordinates
would
recognise
it
as
such
how
long
could
he
maintain
his
position
so
only
he
could
keep
his
grip
upon
the
lever
of
control
till
the
battle
was
over
all
would
be
well
if
not
he
would
fall
and
once
fallen
he
knew
that
now
briber
that
he
was
he
would
never
rise
again
he
was
on
his
way
at
this
moment
to
the
city
to
consult
with
lyman
as
to
a
certain
issue
of
the
contest
between
the
railroad
and
the
ranchers
which
of
late
had
been
brought
to
his
notice
when
appeal
had
been
taken
to
the
supreme
court
by
the
executive
committee
certain
test
cases
had
been
chosen
which
should
represent
all
the
lands
in
question
neither
magnus
nor
annixter
had
so
appealed
believing
of
course
that
their
cases
were
covered
by
the
test
cases
on
trial
at
washington
magnus
had
here
blundered
again
and
the
league
agents
in
san
francisco
had
written
to
warn
him
that
the
railroad
might
be
able
to
take
advantage
of
a
technicality
and
by
pretending
that
neither
quien
sabe
nor
los
muertos
were
included
in
the
appeal
attempt
to
put
its
dummy
buyers
in
possession
of
the
two
ranches
before
the
supreme
court
handed
down
its
decision
the
ninety
days
allowed
for
taking
this
appeal
were
nearly
at
an
end
and
after
then
the
railroad
could
act
osterman
and
magnus
at
once
decided
to
go
up
to
the
city
there
joining
annixter
who
had
been
absent
from
quien
sabe
for
the
last
ten
days
and
talk
the
matter
over
with
lyman
lyman
because
of
his
position
as
commissioner
might
be
cognisant
of
the
plans
and
at
the
same
time
could
give
sound
legal
advice
as
to
what
was
to
be
done
should
the
new
rumour
prove
true
say
remarked
osterman
as
the
train
pulled
out
of
the
bonneville
station
and
the
two
men
settled
themselves
for
the
long
journey
say
governor
what
all
up
with
buck
annixter
these
days
he
got
a
bean
about
something
i
had
not
noticed
answered
magnus
mr
annixter
has
been
away
some
time
lately
i
can
not
imagine
what
should
keep
him
so
long
in
san
that
it
said
osterman
winking
have
three
guesses
guess
right
and
you
get
a
cigar
i
guess
spells
hilma
tree
and
a
little
while
ago
she
quit
quien
sabe
and
hiked
out
to
so
did
buck
do
i
draw
the
cigar
it
up
to
i
have
noticed
her
observed
magnus
a
fine
figure
of
a
woman
she
would
make
some
man
a
good
hoh
wife
buck
annixter
marry
not
much
he
gone
at
last
old
buck
it
as
funny
as
twins
have
to
josh
him
about
it
when
i
see
him
but
when
osterman
and
magnus
at
last
fell
in
with
annixter
in
the
vestibule
of
the
lick
house
on
montgomery
street
nothing
could
be
got
out
of
him
he
was
in
an
execrable
humour
when
magnus
had
broached
the
subject
of
business
he
had
declared
that
all
business
could
go
to
pot
and
when
osterman
his
tongue
in
his
cheek
had
permitted
himself
a
most
distant
allusion
to
a
feemale
girl
annixter
had
cursed
him
for
a
so
vociferously
and
tersely
that
even
osterman
was
cowed
well
insinuated
osterman
what
are
you
dallying
so
much
for
cat
fur
to
make
retorted
annixter
with
oracular
vagueness
two
weeks
before
this
time
annixter
had
come
up
to
the
city
and
had
gone
at
once
to
a
certain
hotel
on
bush
street
behind
the
first
national
bank
that
he
knew
was
kept
by
a
family
connection
of
the
trees
in
his
conjecture
that
hilma
and
her
parents
would
stop
here
he
was
right
their
names
were
on
the
register
ignoring
custom
annixter
marched
straight
up
to
their
rooms
and
before
he
was
well
aware
of
it
was
eating
crow
before
old
man
tree
hilma
and
her
mother
were
out
at
the
time
later
on
tree
returned
alone
leaving
hilma
to
spend
the
day
with
one
of
her
cousins
who
lived
far
out
on
stanyan
street
in
a
little
house
facing
the
park
between
annixter
and
hilma
parents
a
reconciliation
had
been
effected
annixter
convincing
them
both
of
his
sincerity
in
wishing
to
make
hilma
his
wife
hilma
however
refused
to
see
him
as
soon
as
she
knew
he
had
followed
her
to
san
francisco
she
had
been
unwilling
to
return
to
the
hotel
and
had
arranged
with
her
cousin
to
spend
an
indefinite
time
at
her
house
she
was
wretchedly
unhappy
during
all
this
time
would
not
set
foot
out
of
doors
and
cried
herself
to
sleep
night
after
night
she
detested
the
city
already
she
was
miserably
homesick
for
the
ranch
she
remembered
the
days
she
had
spent
in
the
little
happy
in
her
work
making
butter
and
cheese
skimming
the
great
pans
of
milk
scouring
the
copper
vessels
and
vats
plunging
her
arms
elbow
deep
into
the
white
curds
coming
and
going
in
that
atmosphere
of
freshness
cleanliness
and
sunlight
gay
singing
supremely
happy
just
because
the
sun
shone
she
remembered
her
long
walks
toward
the
mission
late
in
the
afternoons
her
excursions
for
cresses
underneath
the
long
trestle
the
crowing
of
the
cocks
the
distant
whistle
of
the
passing
trains
the
faint
sounding
of
the
angelus
she
recalled
with
infinite
longing
the
solitary
expanse
of
the
ranches
the
level
reaches
between
the
horizons
full
of
light
and
silence
the
heat
at
noon
the
cloudless
iridescence
of
the
sunrise
and
sunset
she
had
been
so
happy
in
that
life
now
all
those
days
were
passed
this
crude
raw
city
with
its
crowding
houses
all
of
wood
and
tin
its
blotting
fogs
its
uproarious
trade
winds
disturbed
and
saddened
her
there
was
no
outlook
for
the
future
at
length
one
day
about
a
week
after
annixter
arrival
in
the
city
she
was
prevailed
upon
to
go
for
a
walk
in
the
park
she
went
alone
putting
on
for
the
first
time
the
little
hat
of
black
straw
with
its
puff
of
white
silk
her
mother
had
bought
for
her
a
pink
shirtwaist
her
belt
of
imitation
alligator
skin
her
new
skirt
of
brown
cloth
and
her
low
shoes
set
off
with
their
little
steel
buckles
she
found
a
tiny
summer
house
built
in
japanese
fashion
around
a
diminutive
pond
and
sat
there
for
a

folded
in

lap
amused
with

warning
annixter
sat
down
beside
her
she
was
too
frightened
to
move
she
looked
at
him
with
wide
eyes
that
began
to
fill
with
tears

would
be
glad

night

the
straight
clean
thing

once
i
said
i

me
and
were
afraid
of
me
well
since

i
ashamed
of

and
i

he
suddenly
exclaimed

at
the
goldfishes
through
her
tears

to

to
me
hilma
he
asked
after
a
while
i
do
know
what
you
want
me
to
say
she
murmured
yes
you
do
he
insisted
i
followed
you
up
here
to
hear
it
i
waited
around
in
these
beastly
draughty
picnic
grounds
for
over
a
week
to
hear
it
you
know
what
i
want
to
hear

she
hazarded
that
will

for
a
starter
he
answered
but
that
not
then
i
do
know

i
say
it
for
you
she
hesitated
a
long
minute
then
you
might
say
it
right
she
replied

me
for
that
shall
i
say
it
for
you
hilma
i
do
know
what
you
i
say
what
you
are

of

say
it
there
was
a
very
long
pause
a
goldfish
rose
to
the
surface
of
the
little
pond
with
a
sharp
rippling
sound
the
fog
drifted
overhead
there
was
nobody
about
no
said
hilma
at
length
i
i
i
can
say
it
for
myself
i
all
at
once
she
turned
to
him
and
put
her
arms
around
his
neck
oh
do
you
love
me
she
cried
is
it
really
true
do
you
mean
every
word
of
it
and
you
are
sorry
and
you
will
be
good
to
me
if
i
will
be
your
wife
you
will
be
my
dear
dear
husband
the
tears
sprang
to
annixter
eyes
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
held
her
there
for
a
moment
never
in
his
life
had
he
felt
so
unworthy
so
undeserving
of
this
clean
pure
girl
who
forgave
him
and
trusted
his
spoken
word
and
believed
him
to
be
the
good
man
he
could
only
wish
to
be
she
was
so
far
above
him
so
exalted
so
noble
that
he
should
have
bowed
his
forehead
to
her
feet
and
instead
she
took
him
in
her
arms
believing
him
to
be
good
to
be
her
equal
he
could
think
of
no
words
to
say
the
tears
overflowed
his
eyes
and
ran
down
upon
his
cheeks
she
drew
away
from
him
and
held
him
a
second
at
arm
length
looking
at
him
and
he
saw
that
she
too
had
been
crying
i
think
he
said
we
are
a
couple
of
no
no
she
insisted
i
want
to
cry
and
want
you
to
cry
too
oh
dear
i
have
a
here
take
they
wiped
each
other
eyes
like
two
children
and
for
a
long
time
sat
in
the
deserted
little
japanese
pleasure
house
their
arms
about
each
other
talking
talking
talking
on
the
following
saturday
they
were
married
in
an
uptown
presbyterian
church
and
spent
the
week
of
their
honeymoon
at
a
small
family
hotel
on
sutter
street
as
a
matter
of
course
they
saw
the
sights
of
the
city
together
they
made
the
inevitable
bridal
trip
to
the
cliff
house
and
spent
an
afternoon
in
the
grewsome
and
beauties
of
sutro
gardens
they
went
through
chinatown
the
palace
hotel
the
park
museum
where
hilma
resolutely
refused
to
believe
in
the
egyptian
mummy
and
they
drove
out
in
a
hired
hack
to
the
presidio
and
the
golden
gate
on
the
sixth
day
of
their
excursions
hilma
abruptly
declared
they
had
had
enough
of
playing
out
and
must
be
serious
and
get
to
work
this
work
was
nothing
less
than
the
buying
of
the
furniture
and
appointments
for
the
rejuvenated
ranch
house
at
quien
sabe
where
they
were
to
live
annixter
had
telegraphed
to
his
overseer
to
have
the
building
repainted
replastered
and
reshingled
and
to
empty
the
rooms
of
everything
but
the
telephone
and
safe
he
also
sent
instructions
to
have
the
dimensions
of
each
room
noted
down
and
the
result
forwarded
to
him
it
was
the
arrival
of
these
memoranda
that
had
roused
hilma
to
action
then
ensued
a
most
delicious
week
armed
with
formidable
lists
written
by
annixter
on
hotel
envelopes
they
two
descended
upon
the
department
stores
of
the
city
the
carpet
stores
the
furniture
stores
right
and
left
they
bought
and
bargained
sending
each
consignment
as
soon
as
purchased
to
quien
sabe
nearly
an
entire
car
load
of
carpets
curtains
kitchen
furniture
pictures
fixtures
lamps
straw
matting
chairs
and
the
like
were
sent
down
to
the
ranch

making
a
point
that
their
new
home
should
be
entirely
equipped
by
san
francisco
dealers

furnishings
of
the
bedroom

a
set
of
pure
white
enamel

chairs
a
washstand
and
bureau
a
marvellous
bargain
of
thirty
dollars
discovered
by
wonderful
accident
at
a
friday
the
bed
was
a
piece
by
itself
bought
elsewhere
but
none
the
less
a
wonder
it
was
of
brass
very
brave
and
gay
and
actually
boasted
a
canopy
they
bought
it
complete
just
as
it
stood
in
the
window
of
the
department
store
and
hilma
was
in
an
ecstasy
over
its
crisp
clean
muslin
curtains
spread
and
shams
never
was
there
such
a
bed
the
luxury
of
a
princess
such
a
bed
as
she
had
dreamed
about
her
whole
life
next
the
appointments
of
the
occupied
her
since
annixter
himself
bewildered
by
this
astonishing
display
unable
to
offer
a
single
suggestion
himself
merely
approved

his
journey
home
in

annixter
marched
down
the
line
of
cars
his
hands
encumbered
with
wicker
telescope
baskets
satchels
and
valises
his

in
his
mouth

on

hilma
and

trying

annixter
was
in
a
turmoil
of
nerves
lest
something
should
go
wrong
catching
a
train
was
always
for
him
a
little
crisis
he
rushed
ahead
so
furiously
that
when
he
had
found
his
pullman
he
had
lost
his
party
he
set
down
his
valises
to
mark
the
place
and
charged
back
along
the
platform
waving
his
arms
come
on
he
cried
when
at
length
he
espied
the
others
we
no
more
he
shouldered
and
urged
them
forward
to
where
he
had
set
his
valises
only
to
find
one
of
them
gone
instantly
he
raised
an
outcry

had
already
taken
his
valises
inside
annixter
would
not
permit
hilma
parents
to
board
the
car
declaring
that
the
train
might
pull
out
any
moment
so
he
and
his
wife
following
the
porter
down
the
narrow
passage
by
the
stateroom
took
their
places
and
raising
the
window

promise
hilma
her
mother
hastened
to
exclaim
to
write
every
sunday
there
came
a
prolonged
creaking
and
groan
of
straining
wood
and
iron
work
all
along
the
length
of
the
train
they
all
began
to
cry
their
at
once
the
train
stirred
moved
forward
and
gathering
slow
headway
rolled
slowly
out
into
the
sunlight
hilma
leaned
out
of
the
window
and
as
long
as
she
could
keep
her
mother
in
sight
waved
her
handkerchief
then
at
length
she
sat
back
in
her
seat
and
looked
at
her
husband
well
she
said
well
echoed
annixter
happy
for

tears

in

at
him
bravely

uneasily

was
seized
with
uneasiness
but
not

was
true
that
hilma
had
felt
a
faint
tremour
of
seasickness
on
the
coming
from
the
city
to
the
oakland
mole
no
doubt
a
little
nausea
yet
remained
with
her
but
annixter
refused
to
accept
this
explanation
he
was
distressed
beyond
expression
now

going
to
be

he
cried
anxiously

her
refusing

protesting
that
she
had
dark
circles
under
her
eyes
that
she
had
grown
thinner

he
began
and
then
again
hilma
beat
a
tattoo
with
her
heels
upon
the
floor
shutting
her
fists
the
thumbs
tucked
inside
she
closed
her
eyes
shaking
her
head
energetically

first
call
for

your
wife
is
they
went
forward
and
had
supper
in
the
diner
while
the
long
train
now
out
upon
the
main
line
settled
itself
to
its
pace
the
prolonged
even
gallop
that
it
would
hold
for
the
better
part
of
the
week
spinning
out
the
miles
as
a
cotton
spinner
spins
thread
it
was
already
dark
when
antioch
was
left
behind
abruptly
the
sunset
appeared
to
wheel
in
the
sky
and
readjusted
itself
to
the
right
of
the
track
behind
mount
diablo
here
visible
almost
to
its
base
the
train
had
turned
southward
neroly
was
passed
then
brentwood
then
byron
in
the
gathering
dusk
mountains
began
to
build
themselves
up
on
either
hand
far
off
blocking
the
horizon
the
train
shot
forward
roaring
between
the
mountains
the
land
lay
level
cut
up
into
farms
ranches
these
continually
grew
larger
growing
wheat
began
to
appear
billowing
in
the
wind
of
the
train
passage
the
mountains
grew
higher
the
land
richer
and
by
the
time
the
moon
rose
the
train
was
well
into
the
northernmost
limits
of
the
valley
of
the
san
joaquin
annixter
had
engaged
an
entire
section
and
after

his
wife
went
to
bed
had
the
porter
close
the
upper
berth
hilma
sat
up
in
bed
to
say
her
prayers
both
hands
over
her
face
and
then
kissing
annixter
went
to
sleep
with
the
directness
of
a
little
child
holding
his
hand
in
both
her
own
annixter
who
never
could
sleep
on
the
train
dozed
and
tossed
and
fretted
for
hours
consulting
his
watch
and
whenever
there
was
a
stop
twice
he
rose
to
get
a
drink
of
ice
water
and
between
whiles
was
forever
sitting
up
in
the
narrow
berth
stretching
himself
and
yawning
murmuring
with
uncertain
relevance
oh
lord
lord
there
were
some
dozen
other
passengers
in
the
car
a
lady
with
three
children
a
group
of
a
couple
of
drummers
a
stout
gentleman
with
whiskers
and
a
young
man
in
a
plaid
travelling
cap
whom
annixter
had
observed
before
supper
time
reading
daudet
tartarin
in
the
french
but
by
nine
all
these
people
were
in
their
berths
occasionally
above
the
rhythmic
rumble
of
the
wheels
annixter
could
hear
one
of
the
lady
children
fidgeting
and
complaining
the
stout
gentleman
snored
monotonously
in
two
notes
one
a
rasping
bass
the
other
a
prolonged
treble
at
intervals
a
brakeman
or
the
passenger
conductor
pushed
down
the
aisle
between
the
curtains
his
red
and
white
lamp
over
his
arm
looking
out
into
the
car
annixter
saw
in
an
end
section
where
the
berths
had
not
been
made
up
the
porter
in
his
white
duck
coat
dozing
his
mouth
wide
open
his
head
on
his
shoulder
the
hours
passed
midnight
came
and
went
annixter
checking
off
the
stations
noted
their
passage
of
modesto
merced
and
madeira
then
after
another
broken
nap
he
lost
count
he
wondered
where
they
were
had
they
reached
fresno
yet
raising
the
window
curtain
he
made
a
shade
with
both
hands
on
either
side
of
his
face
and
looked
out
the
night
was
thick
dark
clouded
over
a
fine
rain
was
falling
leaving
horizontal
streaks
on
the
glass
of
the
outside
window
only
the
faintest
grey
blur
indicated
the
sky
everything
else
was
impenetrable
blackness
i
think
sure
we
must
have
passed
fresno
he
muttered
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
about
three
if
we
have
passed
fresno
he
said
to
himself
i
better
wake
the
little
girl
pretty
soon
she
need
about
an
hour
to
dress
better
find
out
for
he
drew
on
his
trousers
and
shoes
got
into
his
coat
and
stepped
out
into
the
aisle
in
the
seat
that
had
been
occupied
by
the
porter
the
pullman
conductor
his
cash
box
and
before
him
was
checking
up
his
berths
a
blue
pencil
behind
his
ear
what
the
next
stop
captain
inquired
annixter
coming
up
have
we
reached
fresno
yet
just
passed
it
the
other
responded
looking
at
annixter
over
his
spectacles
what
the
next
stop
goshen
we
will
be
there
in
about
fair
black
night
is
it
black
as
a
pocket
let
see
you
the
party
in
upper
and
lower
annixter
caught
at
the
back
of
the
nearest
seat
just
in
time
to
prevent
a
fall
and
the
conductor
cash
box
was
shunted
off
the
surface
of
the
plush
seat
and
came
clanking
to
the
floor
the
pintsch
lights
overhead
vibrated
with
blinding
rapidity
in
the
long
sliding
jar
that
ran
through
the
train
from
end
to
end
and
the
momentum
of
its
speed
suddenly
decreasing
all
but
pitched
the
conductor
from
his
seat
a
hideous
rasp
made
itself
heard
from
the
westinghouse
gear
underneath
and
annixter
knew
that
the
wheels
had
ceased
to
revolve
and
that
the
train
was
sliding
forward
upon
the
motionless
flanges
hello
hello
he
exclaimed
what
all
up
now
emergency
brakes
declared
the
conductor
catching
up
his
cash
box
and
thrusting
his
papers
and
tickets
into
it
nothing
much
probably
a
cow
on
the
he
disappeared
carrying
his
lantern
with
him
but
the
other
passengers
all
but
the
stout
gentleman
were
awake
heads
were
thrust
from
out
the
curtains
and
annixter
hurrying
back
to
hilma
was
assailed
by
all
manner
of
questions
what
was
that
anything
wrong
what
up
anyways
hilma
was
just
waking
as
annixter
pushed
the
curtain
aside
oh
i
was
so
frightened
what
the
matter
dear
she
exclaimed
i
do
know
he
answered
only
the
emergency
brakes
just
a
cow
on
the
track
i
guess
do
get
scared
it
is
but
with
a
final
shriek
of
the
westinghouse
appliance
the
train
came
to
a
definite
halt
at
once
the
silence
was
absolute
the
ears
still
numb
with
the
roar
of
wheels
and
clashing
iron
at
first
refused
to
register
correctly
the
smaller
noises
of
the
surroundings
voices
came
from
the
other
end
of
the
car
strange
and
unfamiliar
as
though
heard
at
a
great
distance
across
the
water
the
stillness
of
the
night
outside
was
so
profound
that
the
rain
dripping
from
the
car
roof
upon
the
underneath
was
as
distinct
as
the
ticking
of
a
clock
well
we
sure
stopped
observed
one
of
the
drummers
what
is
it
asked
hilma
again
are
you
sure
there
nothing
wrong
sure
said
annixter
outside
underneath
their
window
they
heard
the
sound
of
hurried
footsteps
crushing
into
the
clinkers
by
the
side
of
the
ties
they
passed
on
and
annixter
heard
some
one
in
the
distance
shout
yes
on
the
other
then
the
door
at
the
end
of
their
car
opened
and
a
brakeman
with
a
red
beard
ran
down
the
aisle
and
out
upon
the
platform
in
front
the
forward
door
closed
everything
was
quiet
again
in
the
stillness
the
fat
gentleman
snores
made
themselves
heard
once
more
the
minutes
passed
nothing
stirred
there
was
no
sound
but
the
dripping
rain
the
line
of
cars
lay
immobilised
and
inert
under
the
night
one
of
the
drummers
having
stepped
outside
on
the
platform
for
a
look
around
returned
saying
there
sure
is
any
station
anywheres
about
and
no
siding
bet
you
they
have
had
an
accident
of
some
ask
the
i
did
he
do
maybe
they
stopped
to
take
on
wood
or
water
or
well
they
would
use
the
emergency
brakes
for
that
would
they
why
this
train
stopped
almost
in
her
own
length
pretty
near
slung
me
out
the
berth
those
were
the
emergency
brakes
i
heard
some
one
say
from
far
out
towards
the
front
of
the
train
near
the
locomotive
came
the
sharp
incisive
report
of
a
revolver
then
two
more
almost
simultaneously
then
after
a
long
interval
a
fourth
say
that
shooting
by
god
boys
they
shooting
say
this
is
a
instantly
a
excitement
flared
from
end
to
end
of
the
car
incredibly
sinister
heard
thus
in
the
night
and
in
the
rain
mysterious
fearful
those
four
pistol
shots
started
confusion
from
out
the
sense
of
security
like
a
frightened
rabbit
hunted
from
her
burrow
the
passengers
of
the
car
looked
into
each
other
faces
it
had
come
to
them
at
last
this
they
had
so
often
read
about
now
they
were
to
see
the
real
thing
now
they
were
to
face
actuality
face
this
danger
of
the
night
leaping
in
from
out

blackness
of
the
roadside

ready
to

were
facing

they
were
held
up

squarely
into
his
eyes
steady
little
girl

said

suddenly

a
moment

a

in
the
aisle
of
the
car
in

huddled
together
like
sheep
holding
on
to
each
other
looking
to
the
men
silently
appealing
for
protection
two
of
them
were
weeping
white
to
the
lips
oh

it
terrible
oh

the

about

eager
faces
interested
and
amused
at
this
surprise
in
his
berth
the
fat
gentleman
with
whiskers
snored
profoundly

one
of
the
drummers

the
other
allowing

to
be
pacified
but
still
holding
his
pistol

open
that
window
cried
annixter
sharply
from
his
place
by
hilma
side
for
the
drummer

made

sash
in

of
the
sections

the
drummer

window
up
and
had
leaned
out
before

others

and
draw
him
away

by
jove
he
shouted
as
he
turned
back

locomotive

it
so

the
drummer
with
the
pistol
now
by
they
come
through
the
cars
and
stand
us
up
they
be
in
here
in
a
minute
lord
what
was
that
from
far
away
up
the
track
apparently
some
ahead
of
the
train
came
the
sound
of
a
heavy
explosion
the
windows
of
the
car
vibrated
with
it
shooting
that
is
shooting
exclaimed
annixter
they
pulled
the
express
and
mail
car
on
ahead
with
the
engine
and
now
they
are
dynamiting
her
that
must
be
it
yes
sure
that
just
what
they
are
the
forward
door
of
the
car
opened
and
closed
and
the
shrieked
and
cowered
the
drummer
with
the
revolver
faced
about
his
eyes
bulging
however
it
was
only
the
train
conductor
hatless
his
lantern
in
his
hand
he
was
soaked
with
rain
he
appeared
in
the
aisle
is
there
a
doctor
in
this
car
he
asked
promptly
the
passengers
surrounded
him
voluble
with
questions
but
he
was
in
a
bad
temper
i
do
know
anything
more
than
you
he
shouted
angrily
it
was
a
i
guess
you
know
that
do
you
well
what
more
do
you
want
to
know
i
ai
got

to

and
they
shot

and
i

exclaimed
the
conductor
what
do
i
know
is
there
a
doctor
in
this
car
that
what
i
want
to
know
the
young
man
stepped
forward
i
a
doctor
he
said
well
come
along
then
returned
the
conductor
in
a
surly
voice
and
the
passengers
in
this
car
he
added
turning
back
at
the
door
and
nodding
his
head
menacingly
will
go
back
to
bed
and
stay
there
it
all
over
and
there
nothing
to
he
went
out
followed
by
the
young
doctor
then
ensued
an
interminable
period
of
silence
the
entire
train
seemed
deserted
helpless
bereft
of
its
engine
a
huge
decapitated
monster
it
lay
around
a
curve
rained
upon
abandoned
there
was
more
fear
in
this
last
condition
of
affairs
more
terror
in
the
idea
of
this
prolonged
line
of
sleepers
with
their
nickelled
fittings
their
plate
glass
their
upholstery
vestibules
and
the
like
loaded
down
with
people
lost
and
forgotten
in
the
night
and
the
rain
than
there
had
been
when
the
actual
danger
threatened
what
was
to
become
of
them
now
who
was
there
to
help
them
their
engine
was
gone
they
were
helpless
what
next
was
to
happen
nobody
came
near
the
car
even
the
porter
had
disappeared
the
wait
seemed
endless
and
the
persistent
snoring
of
the
whiskered
gentleman
rasped
the
nerves
like
the
scrape
of
a
file
well
how
long
are
we
going
to
stick
here
now
began
one
of
the
drummers
wonder
if
they
hurt
the
engine
with
their
dynamite
oh
i
know
they
will
come
through
the
car
and
rob
us
wailed
the
the
lady
with
the
little
children
went
back
to
bed
and
annixter
assured
that
the
trouble
was
over
did
likewise
but
nobody
slept
from
berth
to
berth
came
the
sound
of
suppressed
voices
talking
it
all
over
formulating
conjectures
certain
points
seemed
to
be
settled
upon
no
one
knew
how
as
indisputable
the
highwaymen
had
been
four
in
number
and
had
stopped
the
train
by
pulling
the
bell
cord
a
brakeman
had
attempted
to
interfere
and
had
been
shot
the
robbers
had
been
on
the
train
all
the
way
from
san
francisco
the
drummer
named
max
remembered
to
have
seen
four
characters
in
the
at
lathrop
and
had
intended
to
speak
to
the
conductor
about
them
this
drummer
had
been
in
a
before
and
told
the
story
of
it
over
and
over
again
at
last
after
what
seemed
to
have
been
an
hour
delay
and
when
the
dawn
had
already
begun
to
show
in
the
east
the
locomotive
backed
on
to
the
train
again
with
a
reverberating
jar
that
ran
from
car
to
car
at
the
jolting
the
screamed
in
chorus
and
the
whiskered
gentleman
stopped
snoring
and
thrust
his
head
from
his
curtains
blinking
at
the
pintsch
lights
it
appeared
that
he
was
an
englishman
i
say
he
asked
of
the
drummer
named
max
i
say
my
friend
what
place
is
this
the
others
roared
with
derision
we
were
held
up
sir
that
what
we
were
we
were
held
up
and
you
slept
through
it
all
you
missed
the
show
of
your
the
gentleman
fixed
the
group
with
a
prolonged
gaze
he
said
never
a
word
but
little
by
little
he
was
convinced
that
the
drummers
told
the
truth
all
at
once
he
grew
wrathful
his
face
purpling
he
withdrew
his
head
angrily
buttoning
his
curtains
together
in
a
fury
the
cause
of
his
rage
was
inexplicable
but
they
could
hear
him
resettling
himself
upon
his
pillows
with
exasperated
movements
of
his
head
and
shoulders
in
a
few
moments
the
deep
bass
and
shrill
treble
of
his
snoring
once
more
sounded
through
the
car
at
last
the
train
got
under
way
again
with
useless
warning
blasts
of
the
engine
whistle
in
a
few
moments
it
was
tearing
away
through
the
dawn
at
a
wonderful
speed
rocking
around
curves
roaring
across
culverts
making
up
time
and
all
the
rest
of
that
strange
night
the
passengers
sitting
up
in
their
unmade
beds
in
the
swaying
car
lighted
by
a
strange
mingling
of
pallid
dawn
and
trembling
pintsch
lights
rushing
at
speed
through
the
misty
rain
were
oppressed
by
a
vision
of
figures
of
terror
far
behind
them
in
the
night
they
had
left
masked
armed
galloping
toward
the
mountains
pistol
in
hand
the
booty
bound
to
the
saddle
bow
galloping
galloping
on
sending
a
thrill
of
fear
through
all
the
country
side
the
young
doctor
returned
he
sat
down
in
the
lighting
a
cigarette
and
annixter
and
the
drummers
pressed
around
him
to
know
the
story
of
the
whole
affair
the
man
is
dead
he
declared
the
brakeman
he
was
shot
through
the
lungs
twice
they
think
the
fellow
got
away
with
about
five
thousand
in
gold
the
fellow
was
there
four
of
them
no
only
one
and
say
let
me
tell
you
he
had
his
nerve
with
him
it
seems
he
was
on
the
roof
of
the
express
car
all
the
time
and
going
as
fast
as
we
were
he
jumped
from
the
roof
of
the
car
down
on
to
the
coal
on
the
engine
tender
and
crawled
over
that
and
held
up
the
men
in
the
cab
with
his
gun
took
their
guns
from
and
made
stop
the
train
even
ordered
to
use
the
emergency
gear
seems
he
knew
all
about
it
then
he
went
back
and
uncoupled
the
express
car
himself
while
he
was
doing
this
a
brakeman
you
remember
that
brakeman
that
came
through
here
once
or
twice
had
a
red
that
chap
sure
well
as
soon
as
the
train
stopped
this
brakeman
guessed
something
was
wrong
and
ran
up
saw
the
fellow
cutting
off
the
express
car
and
took
a
couple
of
shots
at
him
and
the
fireman
says
the
fellow
did
even
take
his
hand
off
the
just
turned
around
as
cool
as
and
nailed
the
brakeman
right
there
they
were
five
feet
apart
when
they
began
shooting
the
brakeman
had
come
on
him
unexpected
had
no
idea
he
was
so
and
the
express
messenger
all
this
time
well
he
did
his
best
jumped
out
with
his
repeating
but
the
fellow
had
him
covered
before
he
could
turn
round
held
him
up
and
took
his
gun
away
from
him
say
you
know
i
call
that
nerve
just
the
same
one
man
standing
up
a
whole
like
that
then
as
soon
as
cut
the
express
car
off
he
made
the
engineer
run
her
up
the
track
about
half
a
mile
to
a
road
crossing
where
he
had
a
horse
tied
what
do
you
think
of
that
did
he
have
it
all
figured
out
close
and
when
he
got
there
he
dynamited
the
safe
and
got
the
box
he
took
five
thousand
in
gold
coin
the
messenger
says
it
was
railroad
money
that
the
company
were
sending
down
to
bakersfield
to
pay
off
with
it
was
in
a
bag
he
never
touched
the
registered
mail
nor
a
whole
wad
of
greenbacks
that
were
in
the
safe
but
just
took
the
coin
got
on
his
horse
and
lit
out
the
engineer
says
he
went
to
the
he
got
away
did
he
yes
but
they
think
they
get
him
he
wore
a
kind
of
mask
but
the
brakeman
recognised
him
positively
we
got
his
statement
the
brakeman
said
the
fellow
had
a
grudge
against
the
road
he
was
a
discharged
employee
and
lives
near
dyke
by
the
lord
exclaimed
annixter
that
the
name
said
the
young
doctor
when
the
train
arrived
at
bonneville
forty
minutes
behind
time
it
landed
annixter
and
hilma
in
the
midst
of
the
very
thing
they
most
wished
to
avoid
an
enormous
crowd
the
news
that
the
overland
had
been
held
up
thirty
miles
south
of
fresno
a
brakeman
killed
and
the
safe
looted
and
that
dyke
alone
was
responsible
for
the
night
work
had
been
wired
on
ahead
from
fowler
the
train
conductor
throwing
the
despatch
to
the
station
agent
from
the
flying
train
before
the
train
had
come
to
a
standstill
under
the
arched
roof
of
the
bonneville
depot
it
was
all
but
taken
by
assault
annixter
with
hilma
on
his
arm
had
almost
to
fight
his
way
out
of
the
car
the
depot
was
black
with
people
behrman
was
there
delaney
cyrus
ruggles
the
town
marshal
the
mayor
genslinger
his
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
ranged
the
train
from
cab
to
in
hand
interviewing
questioning
collecting
facts
for
his
extra
as
annixter
descended
finally
to
the
platform
the
editor
alert
as
a
terrier
his
thin
osseous
hands
quivering
with
eagerness
his
brown
dry
face
working
with
excitement
caught
his
elbow
can
i
have
your
version
of
the
affair
annixter
annixter
turned
on
him
abruptly
yes
he
exclaimed
fiercely
you
and
your
gang
drove
dyke
from
his
job
because
he
would
work
for
starvation
wages
then
you
raised
freight
rates
on
him
and
robbed
him
of
all
he
had
you
ruined
him
and
drove
him
to
fill
himself
up
with
caraher
whiskey
he
only
taken
back
what
you
plundered
him
of
and
now
you
going
to
hound
him
over
the
state
hunt
him
down
like
a
wild
animal
and
bring
him
to
the
gallows
at
san
quentin
that
my
version
of
the
affair
mister
genslinger
but
worth
your
subsidy
from
the
and
to
print
there
was
a
murmur
of
approval
from
the
crowd
that
stood
around
and
genslinger
with
an
angry
shrug
of
one
shoulder
took
himself
away
at
length
annixter
brought
hilma
through
the
crowd
to
where
young
vacca
was
waiting
with
the
team
however
they
could
not
at
once
start
for
the
ranch
annixter
wishing
to
ask
some
questions
at
the
freight
office
about
a
final
consignment
of
chairs
it
was
nearly
eleven
before
they
could
start
home
but
to
gain
the
upper
road
to
quien
sabe
it
was
necessary
to
traverse
all
of
main
street
running
through
the
heart
of
bonneville
the
entire
town
seemed
to
be
upon
the
sidewalks
by
now
the
rain
was
over
and
the
sun
shining
the
story
of
the
the
work
of
a
man
whom
every
one
knew
and
liked
was
in
every
mouth
how
had
dyke
come
to
do
it
who
would
have
believed
it
of
him
think
of
his
poor
mother
and
the
little
tad
well
after
all
he
was
not
so
much
to
blame
the
railroad
people
had
brought
it
on
themselves
but
he
had
shot
a
man
to
death
ah
that
was
a
serious
business
big
jovial
dyke
the
man
they
knew
with
whom
they
had
shaken
hands
only
yesterday
yes
and
drank
with
him
he
had
shot
a
man
killed
him
had
stood
there
in
the
dark
and
in
the
rain
while
they
were
asleep
in
their
beds
and
had
killed
a
man
now
where
was
he
instinctively
eyes
were
turned
eastward
over
the
tops
of
the
houses
or
down
vistas
of
side
streets
to
where
the
of
the
mountains
rose
dim
and
vast
over
the
edge
of
the
valley
he
was
in
amongst
them
somewhere
in
all
that
pile
of
blue
crests
and
purple
canyons
he
was
hidden
away
now
for
weeks
of
searching
false
alarms
clews
trailings
watchings
all
the
thrill
and
excitement
of
a
would
he
get
away
hardly
a
man
on
the
sidewalks
of
the
town
that
day
who
did
not
hope
for
it
as
annixter
team
trotted
through
the
central
portion
of
the
town
young
vacca
pointed
to
a
denser
and
larger
crowd
around
the
rear
entrance
of
the
city
hall
fully
twenty
saddle
horses
were
tied
to
the
iron
rail
underneath
the
scant
trees
near
by
and
as
annixter
and
hilma
drove
by
the
crowd
parted
and
a
dozen
men
with
revolvers
on
their
hips
pushed
their
way
to
the
curbstone
and
mounting
their
horses
rode
away
at
a
gallop
it
the
posse
said
young
vacca
outside
the
town
limits
the
ground
was
level
there
was
nothing
to
obstruct
the
view
and
to
the
north
in
the
direction
of
ranch
vacca
made
out
another
party
of
horsemen
galloping
eastward
and
beyond
these
still
another
there
the
other
posses
he
announced
that
further
one
is
archie
moore
he
the
sheriff
he
came
down
from
visalia
on
a
special
engine
this
when
the
team
turned
into
the
driveway
to
the
ranch
house
hilma
uttered
a
little
cry
clasping
her
hands
joyfully
the
house
was
one
glitter
of
new
white
paint
the
driveway
had
been
freshly
gravelled
the
replenished
vacca
and
her
daughter
who
had
been
busy
putting
on
the
finishing
touches
came
to
the
door
to
welcome
them
what
this
case
here
asked
annixter
when
after
helping
his
wife
from
the
his
eye
fell
upon
a
wooden
box
of
some
three
by
five
feet
that
stood
on
the
porch
and
bore
the
red
label
it
came
here
last
night
addressed
to
you
sir
exclaimed
vacca
we
were
sure
it
was
any
of
your
furniture
so
we
did
open
oh
maybe
it
a
wedding
present
exclaimed
hilma
her
eyes
sparkling
well
maybe
it
is
returned
her
husband
here
m
son
help
me
in
with
annixter
and
young
vacca
bore
the
case
into
the
of
the
house
and
annixter
hammer
in
hand
attacked
it
vigorously
vacca
discreetly
withdrew
on
signal
from
his
mother
closing
the
door
after
him
annixter
and
his
wife
were
left
alone
oh
hurry
hurry
cried
hilma
dancing
around
him
i
want
to
see
what
it
is
who
do
you
suppose
could
have
sent
it
to
us
and
so
heavy
too
what
do
you
think
it
can
be
annixter
put
the
claw
of
the
hammer
underneath
the
edge
of
the
board
top
and
wrenched
with
all
his
might
the
boards
had
been
clamped
together
by
a
transverse
bar
and
the
whole
top
of
the
box
came
away
in
one
piece
a
layer
of
excelsior
was
disclosed
and
on
it
a
letter
addressed
by
typewriter
to
annixter
it
bore
the
of
a
business
firm
of
los
angeles
annixter
glanced
at
this
and
promptly
caught
it
up
before
hilma
could
see
with
an
exclamation
of
intelligence
oh
i
know
what
this
is
he
observed
carelessly
trying
to
restrain
her
busy
hands
it
is
anything
just
some
machinery
let
it
but
already
she
had
pulled
away
the
excelsior
underneath
in
temporary
racks
were
two
dozen
winchester
repeating
rifles
why
what
what
murmured
hilma
blankly
well
i
told
you
not
to
mind
said
annixter
it
is
anything
look
through
the
but
you
said
you
knew
what
it
was
she
protested
bewildered
you
wanted
to
make
believe
it
was
machinery
are
you
keeping
anything
from
me
tell
me
what
it
all
means
oh
why
are
you
getting
these
she
caught
his
arm
looking
with
intense
eagerness
into
his
face
she
half
understood
already
annixter
saw
that
well
he
said
lamely
you
know
it
may
not
come
to
anything
at
all
but
you
know
well
this
league
of
ours
suppose
the
railroad
tries
to
jump
quien
sabe
or
los
muertos
or
any
of
the
other
ranches
we
made
up
our
minds
the
leaguers
have
that
we
would
let
it
that
and
i
thought
cried
hilma
drawing
back
fearfully
from
the
case
of
rifles
and
i
thought
it
was
a
wedding
and
that
was
their
the
end
of
their
bridal
trip
through
the
terror
of
the
night
echoing
with
pistol
shots
through
that
scene
of
robbery
and
murder
into
this
atmosphere
of
alarms
a
organising
armed
horsemen
silhouetted
against
the
horizons
cases
of
rifles
where
wedding
presents
should
have
been
annixter
brought
his
young
wife
to
be
mistress
of
a
home
he
might
at
any
moment
be
called
upon
to
defend
with
his
life
the
days
passed
soon
a
week
had
gone
by
magnus
derrick
and
osterman
returned
from
the
city
without
any
definite
idea
as
to
the
plans
lyman
had
been
reticent
he
knew
nothing
as
to
the
progress
of
the
land
cases
in
washington
there
was
no
news
the
executive
committee
of
the
league
held
a
perfunctory
meeting
at
los
muertos
at
which
nothing
but
routine
business
was
transacted
a
scheme
put
forward
by
osterman
for
a
conference
with
the
railroad
managers
fell
through
because
of
the
refusal
of
the
company
to
treat
with
the
ranchers
upon
any
other
basis
than
that
of
the
new
grading
it
was
impossible
to
learn
whether
or
not
the
company
considered
los
muertos
quien
sabe
and
the
ranches
around
bonneville
covered
by
the
test
cases
then
on
appeal
meanwhile
there
was
no
decrease
in
the
excitement
that
dyke
had
set
loose
over
all
the
county
day
after
day
it
was
the
one
topic
of
conversation
at
street
corners
at
over
dinner
tables
in
office
bank
and
store
behrman
placarded
the
town
with
a
notice
of
reward
for
the
capture
dead
or
alive
and
the
express
company
supplemented
this
by
another
offer
of
an
equal
amount
the
country
was
thick
with
parties
of
horsemen
armed
with
rifles
and
revolvers
recruited
from
visalia
goshen
and
the
few
railroad
sympathisers
around
bonneville
and
guadlajara
one
after
another
of
these
returned
covered
with
dust
and
mud
their
horses
exhausted
to
be
met
and
passed
by
fresh
posses
starting
out
to
continue
the
pursuit
the
sheriff
of
santa
clara
county
sent
down
his
bloodhounds
from
san
jose
small
dogs
with
a
terrific
bay
to
help
in
the
chase
reporters
from
the
san
francisco
papers
appeared
interviewing
every
one
sometimes
even
accompanying
the
searching
bands
horse
hoofs
clattered
over
the
roads
at
night
bells
were
rung
the
mercury
issued
extra
after
extra
the
bloodhounds
bayed
gun
butts
clashed
on
the
asphalt
pavements
of
bonneville
accidental
discharges
of
revolvers
brought
the
whole
town
into
the
street
farm
hands
called
to
each
other
across
the
fences
of
in
a
word
the
was
in
an
uproar
and
all
to
no
effect
the
of
dyke
horse
had
been
traced
in
the
mud
of
the
road
to
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
the
and
there
irretrievably
lost
three
days
after
the
a
was
found
who
had
seen
the
highwayman
on
a
ridge
in
the
higher
mountains
to
the
northeast
of
taurusa
and
that
was
absolutely
all
rumours
were
thick
promising
clews
were
discovered
new
trails
taken
up
but
nothing
transpired
to
bring
the
pursuers
and
pursued
any
closer
together
then
after
ten
days
of
strain
public
interest
began
to
flag
it
was
believed
that
dyke
had
succeeded
in
getting
away
if
this
was
true
he
had
gone
to
the
southward
after
gaining
the
mountains
and
it
would
be
his
intention
to
work
out
of
the
range
somewhere
near
the
southern
part
of
the
san
joaquin
near
bakersfield
thus
the
sheriffs
marshals
and
deputies
decided
they
had
hunted
too
many
criminals
in
these
mountains
before
not
to
know
the
usual
courses
taken
in
time
dyke
must
come
out
of
the
mountains
to
get
water
and
provisions
but
this
time
passed
and
from
not
one
of
the
watched
points
came
any
word
of
his
appearance
at
last
the
posses
began
to
disband
little
by
little
the
pursuit
was
given
up
only
behrman
persisted
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
bring
dyke
in
he
succeeded
in
arousing
the
same
degree
of
determination
in
delaney
by
now
a
trusted
aide
of
the
railroad
and
of
his
own
cousin
a
real
estate
broker
named
christian
who
knew
the
mountains
and
had
once
been
marshal
of
visalia
in
the
old
days
these
two
went
into
the
sierras
accompanied
by
two
hired
deputies
and
carrying
with
them
a
month
provisions
and
two
of
the
bloodhounds
loaned
by
the
santa
clara
sheriff
on
a
certain
sunday
a
few
days
after
the
departure
of
christian
and
delaney
annixter
who
had
been
reading
david
copperfield
in
his
hammock
on
the
porch
of
the
ranch
house
put
down
the
book
and
went
to
find
hilma
who
was
helping
louisa
vacca
set
the
table
for
dinner
he
found
her
in
the
her
hands
full
of
the
china
plates
only
used
on
special
occasions
and
which
louisa
was
forbidden
to
touch
his
wife
was
more
than
ordinarily
pretty
that
day
she
wore
a
dress
of
flowered
organdie
over
pink
sateen
with
pink
ribbons
about
her
waist
and
neck
and
on
her
slim
feet
the
low
shoes
she
always
affected
with
their
smart
bright
buckles
her
thick
brown
hair
was
heaped
high
upon
her
head
and
set
off
with
a
bow
of
black
velvet
and
underneath
the
shadow
of
its
coils
her
eyes
rimmed
with
the
thin
black
line
of
her
lashes
shone
continually
reflecting
the
sunlight
marriage
had
only
accentuated
the
beautiful
maturity
of
hilma
figure
now
no
longer
precocious
defining
the
single
deep
swell
from
her
throat
to
her
waist
the
strong
fine
amplitude
of
her
hips
the
sweet
feminine
undulation
of
her
neck
and
shoulders
her
cheeks
were
pink
with
health
and
her
large
round
arms
carried
the
dishes
with
never
a
tremour
annixter
observant
enough
where
his
wife
was
concerned
noted
how
the
reflection
of
the
white
china
set
a
glow
of
pale
light
underneath
her
chin
hilma
he
said
i
been
wondering
lately
about
things
we
so
blamed
happy
ourselves
it
wo
do
for
us
to
forget
about
other
people
who
are
down
will
it
might
change
our
luck
and
i
just
likely
to
forget
that
way
too
it
my
his
wife
looked
up
at
him
joyfully
here
was
the
new
annixter
certainly
in
all
this
hullabaloo
about
dyke
he
went
on
there
some
one
nobody
ai
thought
about
at
all
that
dyke
and
the
little
tad
i
would
be
surprised
if
they
were
in
a
hole
over
there
what
do
you
say
we
drive
over
to
the
hop
ranch
after
dinner
and
see
if
she
wants
anything
hilma
put
down
the
plates
and
came
around
the
table
and
kissed
him
without
a
word
as
soon
as
their
dinner
was
over
annixter
had
the
hitched
up
and
dispensing
with
young
vacca
drove
over
to
the
hop
ranch
with
hilma
hilma
could
not
keep
back
the
tears
as
they
passed
through
the
lamentable
desolation
of
the
withered
brown
vines
symbols
of
perished
hopes
and
abandoned
effort
and
annixter
swore
between
his
teeth
though
the
wheels
of
the
grated
loudly
on
the
roadway
in
front
of
the
house
nobody
came
to
the
door
nor
looked
from
the
windows
the
place
seemed
tenantless
infinitely
lonely
infinitely
sad
annixter
tied
the
team
and
with
hilma
approached
the
door
scuffling
and
tramping
on
the
porch
to
attract
attention
nobody
stirred
a
sunday
stillness
pervaded
the
place
outside
the
withered
rustled
like
dry
paper
in
the
breeze
the
quiet
was
ominous
they
peered
into
the
front
room
from
the
doorway
hilma
holding
her
husband
hand
dyke
was
there
she
sat
at
the
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
her
head
with
its
white
hair
down
upon
her
arm
a
clutter
of
unwashed
dishes
were
strewed
over
the
red
and
white
tablecloth
the
unkempt
room
once
a
marvel
of
neatness
had
not
been
cleaned
for
days
newspapers
genslinger
extras
and
copies
of
san
francisco
and
los
angeles
dailies
were
scattered
all
over
the
room
on
the
table
itself
were
crumpled
yellow
telegrams
a
dozen
of
them
a
score
of
them
blowing
about
in
the
draught
from
the
door
and
in
the
midst
of
all
this
disarray
surrounded
by
the
published
accounts
of
her
son
crime
the
telegraphed
answers
to
her
pitiful
appeals
for
tidings
fluttering
about
her
head
the
highwayman
mother
worn
out
abandoned
and
forgotten
slept
through
the
stillness
of
the
sunday
afternoon
neither
hilma
nor
annixter
ever
forgot
their
interview
with
dyke
that
day
suddenly
waking
she
had
caught
sight
of
annixter
and
at
once
exclaimed
eagerly
is
there
any
news
for
a
long
time
afterwards
nothing
could
be
got
from
her
she
was
numb
to
all
other
issues
than
the
one
question
of
dyke
capture
she
did
not
answer
their
questions
nor
reply
to
their
offers
of
assistance
hilma
and
annixter
conferred
together
without
lowering
their
voices
at
her
very
elbow
while
she
looked
vacantly
at
the
floor
drawing
one
hand
over
the
other
in
a
persistent
maniacal
gesture
from
time
to
time
she
would
start
suddenly
from
her
chair
her
eyes
wide
and
as
if
all
at
once
realising
annixter
presence
would
cry
out
is
there
any
news
where
is
sidney
dyke
asked
hilma
for
the
fourth
time
is
she
well
is
she
taken
care
of
here
the
last
telegram
said
dyke
in
a
loud
monotonous
voice
see
it
says
there
is
no
news
he
did
do
it
she
moaned
rocking
herself
back
and
forth
drawing
one
hand
over
the
other
he
did
do
it
he
did
do
it
he
did
do
it
i
do
know
where
he
when
at
last
she
came
to
herself
it
was
with
a
flood
of
tears
hilma
put
her
arms
around
the
poor
old
woman
as
she
bowed
herself
again
upon
the
table
sobbing
and
weeping
oh
my
son
my
son
she
cried
my
own
boy
my
only
son
if
i
could
have
died
for
you
to
have
prevented
this
i
remember
him
when
he
was
little
such
a
splendid
little
fellow
so
brave
so
loving
with
never
an
unkind
thought
never
a
mean
action
so
it
was
all
his
life
we
were
never
apart
it
was
always
little
son
and
mammy
between
us
never
once
was
he
unkind
and
he
loved
me
and
was
the
gentlest
son
to
me
and
he
was
a
good
man
he
is
now
he
is
now
they
understand
him
they
are
not
even
sure
that
he
did
this
he
never
meant
it
they
do
know
my
son
why
he
would
have
hurt
a
kitten
everybody
loved
him
he
was
driven
to
it
they
hounded
him
down
they
would
let
him
alone
he
was
not
right
in
his
mind
they
hounded
him
to
it
she
cried
fiercely
they
hounded
him
to
it
they
drove
him
and
goaded
him
till
he
could
stand
it
any
longer
and
now
they
mean
to
kill
him
for
turning
on
them
they
are
hunting
him
with
dogs
night
after
night
i
have
stood
on
the
porch
and
heard
the
dogs
baying
far
off
they
are
tracking
my
boy
with
dogs
like
a
wild
animal
may
god
never
forgive
she
rose
to
her
feet
terrible
her
white
hair
unbound
may
god
punish
them
as
they
deserve
may
they
never
prosper
on
my
knees
i
shall
pray
for
it
every
night
may
their
money
be
a
curse
to
them
may
their
sons
their
only
sons
be
taken
from
them
in
their
but
hilma
interrupted
begging
her
to
be
silent
to
be
quiet
the
tears
came
again
then
and
the
choking
sobs
hilma
took
her
in
her
arms
oh
my
little
boy
my
little
boy
she
cried
my
only
son
all
that
i
had
to
have
come
to
this
he
was
not
right
in
his
mind
or
he
would
have
known
it
would
break
my
heart
oh
my
son
my
son
if
i
could
have
died
for
sidney
came
in
clinging
to
her
dress
weeping
imploring
her
not
to
cry
protesting
that
they
never
could
catch
her
papa
that
he
would
come
back
soon
hilma
took
them
both
the
little
child
and
the
old
woman
in
the
great
embrace
of
her
strong
arms
and
they
all
three
sobbed
together
annixter
stood
on
the
porch
outside
his
back
turned
looking
straight
before
him
into
the
wilderness
of
dead
vines
his
teeth
shut
hard
his
lower
lip
thrust
out
i
hope
behrman
is
satisfied
with
all
this
he
muttered
i
hope
he
is
satisfied
now
damn
his
soul
all
at
once
an
idea
occurred
to
him
he
turned
about
and
reentered
the
room
mrs
dyke
he
began
i
want
you
and
sidney
to
come
over
and
live
at
quien

i
know

me
believe
that

reporters
and
officers
and
officious

so
as
they
can
satisfy
their
curiosity
are
nagging

let

little
tad

of
place
for

short

a
little
while
now
i
want
you
to
let
me
help
you
let
hilma
and
me
be
good
friends
to
you
it
would
be
a
dyke
tried
bravely
to
assume
her
pride
insisting
that
she
could
manage
but
her
spirit
was
broken
the
whole
affair
ended
unexpectedly
with
annixter
and
hilma
bringing
dyke
mother
and
little
girl
back
to
quien
sabe
in
the
dyke
would
not
take
with
her
a
stick
of
furniture
nor
a
single
ornament
it
would
only
serve
to
remind
her
of
a
vanished
happiness
she
packed
a
few
clothes
of
her
own
and
sidney
in
a
little
trunk
hilma
helping
her
and
annixter
stowed
the
trunk
under
the
back
seat
dyke
turned
the
key
in
the
door
of
the
house
and
annixter
helped
her
to
her
seat
beside
his
wife
they
drove
through
the
sear
brown
hop
vines
at
the
angle
of
the
road
dyke
turned
around
and
looked
back
at
the
ruin
of
the
hop
ranch
the
roof
of
the
house
just
showing
above
the
trees
she
never
saw
it
again
as
soon
as
annixter
and
hilma
were
alone
after
their
return
to
quien
sabe
dyke
and
sidney
having
been
installed
in
the
trees
old
house
hilma
threw
her
arms
around
her
husband
neck
fine
she
exclaimed
oh
it
was
fine
of
you
dear
to
think
of
them
and
to
be
so
good
to
them
my
husband
is
such
a
good
man
so
unselfish
you
would
have
thought
of
being
kind
to
dyke
and
sidney
a
little
while
ago
you
would
have
thought
of
them
at
all
but
you
did
now
and
it
just
because
you
love
me
true
is
it
is
it
and
because
it
made
you
a
better
man
i
so
proud
and
glad
to
think
it
so
it
is
so
is
it
just
because
you
love
me
you
bet
it
is
hilma
he
told
her
as
hilma
and
annixter
were
sitting
down
to
the
supper
which
they
found
waiting
for
them
louisa
vacca
came
to
the
door
of
the
to
say
that
harran
derrick
had
telephoned
over
from
los
muertos
for
annixter
and
had
left
word
for
him
to
ring
up
los
muertos
as
soon
as
he
came
in
he
said
it
was
important
added
louisa
vacca
maybe
they
have
news
from
washington
suggested
hilma
annixter
would
not
wait
to
have
supper
but
telephoned
to
los
muertos
at
once
magnus
answered
the
call
there
was
a
special
meeting
of
the
executive
committee
of
the
league
summoned
for
the
next
day
he
told
annixter
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
considering
the
new
grain
tariff
prepared
by
the
railroad
commissioners
lyman
had
written
that
the
schedule
of
this
tariff
had
just
been
issued
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
construct
it
precisely
according
to
the
wishes
and
that
he
himself
would
come
down
to
los
muertos
and
explain
its
apparent
discrepancies
magnus
said
lyman
would
be
present
at
the
session
annixter
curious
for
details
forbore
nevertheless
to
question
the
connection
from
los
muertos
to
quien
sabe
was
made
through
bonneville
and
in
those
troublesome
times
no
one
could
be
trusted
it
could
not
be
known
who
would
overhear
conversations
carried
on
over
the
lines
he
assured
magnus
that
he
would
be
on
hand
the
time
for
the
committee
meeting
had
been
set
for
seven
in
the
evening
in
order
to
accommodate
lyman
who
wrote
that
he
would
be
down
on
the
evening
train
but
would
be
compelled
by
pressure
of
business
to
return
to
the
city
early
the
next
morning
at
the
time
appointed
the
men
composing
the
committee
gathered
about
the
table
in
the
of
the
los
muertos
ranch
house
it
was
almost
a
reproduction
of
the
scene
of
the
famous
evening
when
osterman
had
proposed
the
plan
of
the
ranchers
railroad
commission
magnus
derrick
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
in
his
buttoned
frock
coat
whiskey
bottles
and
siphons
of
were
within
easy
reach
presley
who
by
now
was
considered
the
confidential
friend
of
every
member
of
the
committee
lounged
as
before
on
the
sofa
smoking
cigarettes
the
cat
nathalie
on
his
knee
besides
magnus
and
annixter
osterman
was
present
and
old
broderson
and
harran
garnet
from
the
ruby
rancho
and
gethings
of
the
san
pablo
who
were
also
members
of
the
executive
committee
were
on
hand
preoccupied
bearded
men
smoking
black
cigars
and
last
of
all
dabney
the
silent
old
man
of
whom
little
was
known
but
his
name
and
who
had
been
made
a
member
of
the
committee
nobody
could
tell
why
my
son
lyman
should
be
here
gentlemen
within
at
least
ten
minutes
i
have
sent
my
team
to
meet
him
at
bonneville
explained
magnus
as
he
called
the
meeting
to
order
the
secretary
will
call
the
osterman
called
the
roll
and
to
fill
in
the
time
read
over
the
minutes
of
the
previous
meeting
the
treasurer
was
making
his
report
as
to
the
funds
at
the
disposal
of
the
league
when
lyman
arrived
magnus
and
harran
went
forward
to
meet
him
and
the
committee
rather
awkwardly
rose
and
remained
standing
while
the
three
exchanged
greetings
the
members
some
of
whom
had
never
seen
their
commissioner
eyeing
him
out
of
the
corners
of
their
eyes
lyman
was
dressed
with
his
usual
correctness
his
cravat
was
of
the
latest
fashion
his
clothes
of
careful
design
and
unimpeachable
fit
his
shoes
of
patent
leather
reflected
the
lamplight
and
he
carried
a
drab
overcoat
over
his
arm
before
being
introduced
to
the
committee
he
excused
himself
a
moment
and
ran
to
see
his
mother
who
waited
for
him
in
the
adjoining
but
in
a
few
moments
he
returned
asking
pardon
for
the
delay
he
was
all
affability
his
protruding
eyes
that
gave
such
an
unusual
foreign
appearance
to
his
very
dark
face
radiated
geniality
he
was
evidently
anxious
to
please
to
produce
a
good
impression
upon
the
grave
clumsy
farmers
before
whom
he
stood
but
at
the
same
time
presley
watching
him
from
his
place
on
the
sofa
could
imagine
that
he
was
rather
nervous
he
was
too
nimble
in
his
cordiality
and
the
little
gestures
he
made
in
bringing
his
cuffs
into
view
and
in
touching
the
ends
of
his
tight
black
mustache
with
the
ball
of
his
thumb
were
repeated
with
unnecessary
frequency
mr
broderson
my
son
lyman
my
eldest
son
annixter
my
son
the
governor
introduced
him
to
the
ranchers
proud
of
lyman
good
looks
his
correct
dress
his
ease
of
manner
lyman
shook
hands
all
around
keeping
up
a
flow
of
small
talk
finding
a
new
phrase
for
each
member
complimenting
osterman
whom
he
already
knew
upon
his
talent
for
organisation
recalling
a
mutual
acquaintance
to
the
mind
of
old
broderson
at
length
however
he
sat
down
at
the
end
of
the
table
opposite
his
brother
there
was
a
silence
magnus
rose
to
recapitulate
the
reasons
for
the
extra
session
of
the
committee
stating
again
that
the
board
of
railway
commissioners
which
they
the
ranchers
had
succeeded
in
seating
had
at
length
issued
the
new
schedule
of
reduced
rates
and
that
derrick
had
been
obliging
enough
to
offer
to
come
down
to
los
muertos
in
person
to
acquaint
the
of
the
san
joaquin
with
the
new
rates
for
the
carriage
of
their
grain
but
lyman
very
politely
protested
addressing
his
father
punctiliously
as
mr
chairman
and
the
other
ranchers
as
gentlemen
of
the
executive
committee
of
the
he
had
no
wish
he
said
to
disarrange
the
regular
proceedings
of
the
committee
would
it
not
be
preferable
to
defer
the
reading
of
his
report
till
new
business
was
called
for
in
the
meanwhile
let
the
committee
proceed
with
its
usual
work
he
understood
the
necessarily
delicate
nature
of
this
work
and
would
be
pleased
to
withdraw
till
the
proper
time
arrived
for
him
to
speak
good
deal
of
backing
and
filling
about
the
reading
of
a
column
of
figures
muttered
annixter
to
the
man
at
his
elbow
lyman
awaited
the
committee
he
sat
down
touching
the
ends
of
his
mustache
oh
play
ball
growled
annixter
gethings
rose
to
say
that
as
the
meeting
had
been
called
solely
for
the
purpose
of
hearing
and
considering
the
new
grain
tariff
he
was
of
the
opinion
that
routine
business
could
be
dispensed
with
and
the
schedule
read
at
once
it
was
so
ordered
lyman
rose
and
made
a
long
speech
voluble
as
osterman
himself
he
nevertheless
had
at
his
command
a
vast
number
of
phrases
the
staples
of
a
political
speaker
the
stock
in
trade
of
the
commercial
lawyer
which
rolled
off
his
tongue
with
the
most
persuasive
fluency
by
degrees
in
the
course
of
his
speech
he
began
to
insinuate
the
idea
that
the
had
never
expected
to
settle
their
difficulties
with
the
railroad
by
the
work
of
a
single
commission
that
they
had
counted
upon
a
long
continued
campaign
of
many
years
railway
commission
succeeding
railway
commission
before
the
desired
low
rates
should
be
secured
that
the
present
board
of
commissioners
was
only
the
beginning
and
that
too
great
results
were
not
expected
from
them
all
this
he
contrived
to
mention
casually
in
the
talk
as
if
it
were
a
foregone
conclusion
a
matter
understood
by
all
as
the
speech
continued
the
eyes
of
the
ranchers
around
the
table
were
fixed
with
growing
attention
upon
this
young
man
who
spoke
so
fluently
and
who
told
them
of
their
own
intentions
a
feeling
of
perplexity
began
to
spread
and
the
first
taint
of
distrust
invaded
their
minds
but
the
good
work
has
been
most
auspiciously
inaugurated
continued
lyman
reforms
so
sweeping
as
the
one
contemplated
can
not
be
accomplished
in
a
single
night
great
things
grow
slowly
benefits
to
be
permanent
must
accrue
gradually
yet
in
spite
of
all
this
your
commissioners
have
done
much
already
the
phalanx
of
the
enemy
is
pierced
already
his
armour
is
dinted
pledged
as
were
your
commissioners
to
an
average
ten
per
cent
reduction
in
rates
for
the
carriage
of
grain
by
the
pacific
and
southwestern
railroad
we
have
rigidly
adhered
to
the
demands
of
our
constituency
we
have
obeyed
the
people
the
main
problem
has
not
yet
been
completely
solved
that
is
for
later
when
we
shall
have
gathered
sufficient
strength
to
attack
the
enemy
in
his
very
stronghold
but
an
average
ten
per
cent
cut
has
been
made
all
over
the
state
we
have
made
a
great
advance
have
taken
a
great
step
forward
and
if
the
work
is
carried
ahead
upon
the
lines
laid
down
by
the
present
commissioners
and
their
constituents
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
within
a
very
few
years
equitable
and
stable
rates
for
the
shipment
of
grain
from
the
san
joaquin
valley
to
stockton
port
costa
and
tidewater
will
be
permanently
well
hold
on
exclaimed
annixter
out
of
order
and
ignoring
the
governor
reproof
has
your
commission
reduced
grain
rates
in
the
san
joaquin
we
have
reduced
grain
rates
by
ten
per
cent
all
over
the
state
rejoined
lyman
here
are
copies
of
the
new
he
drew
them
from
his
valise
and
passed
them
around
the
table
you
see
he
observed
the
rate
between
mayfield
and
oakland
for
instance
has
been
reduced
by
cents
a
yes
but
but
said
old
broderson
it
is
rather
unusual
is
it
for
wheat
in
that
district
to
be
sent
to
oakland
why
look
here
exclaimed
annixter
looking
up
from
the
schedule
where
is
there
any
reduction
in
rates
in
the
san
joaquin
from
bonneville
and
guadalajara
for
instance
i
do
see
as
you
made
any
reduction
at
all
is
this
right
did
you
give
me
the
right
schedule
of
course
all
the
points
in
the
state
could
not
be
covered
at
once
returned
lyman
we
never
expected
you
know
that
we
could
cut
rates
in
the
san
joaquin
the
very
first
move
that
is
for
later
but
you
will
see
we
made
very
material
reductions
on
shipments
from
the
upper
sacramento
valley
also
the
rate
from
ione
to
marysville
has
been
reduced
eighty
cents
a
why
rot
cried
annixter
no
one
ever
ships
wheat
that
the
salinas
rate
continued
lyman
has
been
lowered
cents
the
helena
rate
fifty
cents
and
please
notice
the
very
drastic
cut
from
red
bluff
north
along
the
oregon
route
to
the
oregon
state
where
not
a
carload
of
wheat
is
shipped
in
a
year
commented
gethings
of
the
san
pablo
oh
you
will
find
yourself
mistaken
there
gethings
returned
lyman
courteously
and
for
the
matter
of
that
a
low
rate
would
stimulate
in
that
the
order
of
the
meeting
was
broken
up
neglected
magnus
did
not
even
pretend
to
preside
in
the
growing
excitement
over
the
inexplicable
schedule
routine
was
not
thought
of
every
one
spoke
at
will
why
lyman
demanded
magnus
looking
across
the
table
to
his
son
is
this
schedule
correct
you
have
not
cut
rates
in
the
san
joaquin
at
all
we
these
gentlemen
here
and
myself
we
are
no
better
off
than
we
were
before
we
secured
your
election
as
we
were
pledged
to
make
an
average
ten
per
cent
cut
sir
it
is
an
average
ten
per
cent
cut
cried
osterman
oh
yes
that
plain
it
an
average
ten
per
cent
cut
all
right
but
you
made
it
by
cutting
grain
rates
between
points
where
practically
no
grain
is
shipped
we
the
in
the
san
joaquin
where
all
the
wheat
is
grown
are
right
where
we
were
before
the
railroad
wo
lose
a
nickel
by
jingo
boys
he
glanced
around
the
table
i
like
to
know
what
this
the
railroad
if
you
come
to
that
returned
lyman
has
already
lodged
a
protest
against
the
new
annixter
uttered
a
derisive
shout
a
protest
that
good
that
is
when
the
and
objects
to
rates
it
do
m
son
the
first
you
hear
from
shelgrim
is
an
injunction
from
the
courts
preventing
the
order
for
new
rates
from
taking
effect
by
the
lord
he
cried
angrily
leaping
to
his
feet
i
would
like
to
know
what
all
this
means
too
why
did
you
reduce
our
grain
rates
what
did
we
elect
you
for
yes
what
did
we
elect
you
for
demanded
osterman
and
gethings
also
getting
to
their
feet
order
order
gentlemen
cried
magnus
remembering
the
duties
of
his
office
and
rapping
his
knuckles
on
the
table
this
meeting
has
been
allowed
to
degenerate
too
far
you
elected
us
declared
lyman
doggedly
to
make
an
average
ten
per
cent
cut
on
grain
rates
we
have
done
it
only
because
you
benefit
at
once
you
object
it
makes
a
difference
whose
ox
is
gored
it
lyman
it
was
magnus
who
spoke
he
had
drawn
himself
to
his
full
six
feet
his
eyes
were
flashing
direct
into
his
son
his
voice
rang
with
severity
lyman
what
does
this
mean
the
other
spread
out
his
hands
as
you
see
sir
we
have
done
our
best
i
warned
you
not
to
expect
too
much
i
told
you
that
this
question
of
transportation
was
difficult
you
would
not
wish
to
put
rates
so
low
that
the
action
would
amount
to
confiscation
of
why
did
you
not
lower
rates
in
the
valley
of
the
san
joaquin
that
was
not
a
prominent
issue
in
the
affair
responded
lyman
carefully
emphasising
his
words
i
understand
of
course
it
was
to
be
approached
in
time
the
main
point
was
an
average
ten
per
cent
reduction
rates
will
be
lowered
in
the
san
joaquin
the
ranchers
around
bonneville
will
be
able
to
ship
to
port
costa
at
equitable
rates
but
so
radical
a
measure
as
that
can
not
be
put
through
in
a
turn
of
the
hand
we
must
study
you
knew
the
san
joaquin
rate
was
an
issue
shouted
annixter
shaking
his
finger
across
the
table
what
do
we
men
who
backed
you
care
about
rates
up
in
del
norte
and
siskiyou
counties
not
a
whoop
in
hell
it
was
the
san
joaquin
rate
we
were
fighting
for
and
we
elected
you
to
reduce
that
you
did
do
it
and
you
do
intend
to
and
by
the
lord
harry
i
want
to
know
you
know
sir
began
lyman
well
i
tell
you
why
vociferated
osterman
i
tell
you
why
it
because
we
have
been
sold
out
it
because
the
and
have
had
their
spoon
in
this
boiling
it
because
our
commissioners
have
betrayed
us
it
because
we
a
set
of
damn
fool
farmers
and
have
been
cinched
lyman
paled
under
his
dark
skin
at
the
direct
attack
he
evidently
had
not
expected
this
so
soon
for
the
fraction
of
one
instant
he
lost
his
poise
he
strove
to
speak
but
caught
his
breath
stammering
what
have
you
to
say
then
cried
harran
who
until
now
had
not
spoken
i
have
this
to
say
answered
lyman
making
head
as
best
he
might
that
this
is
no
proper
spirit
in
which
to
discuss
business
the
commission
has
fulfilled
its
obligations
it
has
adjusted
rates
to
the
best
of
its
ability
we
have
been
at
work
for
two
months
on
the
preparation
of
this
schedule
that
a
lie
shouted
annixter
his
face
scarlet
that
a
lie
that
schedule
was
drawn
in
the
offices
of
the
pacific
and
southwestern
and
you
know
it
it
a
scheme
of
rates
made
for
the
railroad
and
by
the
railroad
and
you
were
bought
over
to
put
your
name
to
there
was
a
concerted
outburst
at
the
words
all
the
men
in
the
room
were
on
their
feet
gesticulating
and
vociferating
gentlemen
gentlemen
cried
magnus
are
we
schoolboys
are
we
ruffians
of
the
street
we
a
set
of
fool
farmers
and
we
been
betrayed
cried
osterman
well
what
have
you
to
say
what
have
you
to
say
persisted
harran
leaning
across
the
table
toward
his
brother
for
god
sake
lyman
you
got
some
you
misunderstood
protested
lyman
white
and
trembling
misunderstood
you
expected
too
much
next
year
next
year
soon
now
the
commission
will
take
up
the
the
commission
will
consider
the
san
joaquin
rate
we
done
our
best
that
is
have
you
sir
demanded
magnus
the
governor
head
was
in
a
whirl
a
sensation
almost
of
faintness
had
seized
upon
him
was
it
possible
was
it
possible
have
you
done
your
best
for
a
second
he
compelled
lyman
eye
the
glances
of
father
and
son
met
and
in
spite
of
his
best
efforts
lyman
eyes
wavered
he
began
to
protest
once
more
explaining
the
matter
over
again
from
the
beginning
but
magnus
did
not
listen
in
that
brief
lapse
of
time
he
was
convinced
that
the
terrible
thing
had
happened
that
the
unbelievable
had
come
to
pass
it
was
in
the
air
between
father
and
son
in
some
subtle
fashion
the
truth
that
was
a
lie
stood
suddenly
revealed
but
even
then
magnus
would
not
receive
it
lyman
do
this
his
son
his
eldest
son
descend
to
this
once
more
and
for
the
last
time
he
turned
to
him
and
in
his
voice
there
was
that
ring
that
compelled
silence
lyman
he
said
i
adjure
you
i
i
demand
of
you
as
you
are
my
son
and
an
honourable
man
explain
yourself
what
is
there
behind
all
this
it
is
no
longer
as
chairman
of
the
committee
i
speak
to
you
you
a
member
of
the
railroad
commission
it
is
your
father
who
speaks
and
i
address
you
as
my
son
do
you
understand
the
gravity
of
this
crisis
do
you
realise
the
responsibility
of
your
position
do
you
not
see
the
importance
of
this
moment
explain
there
is
nothing
to
you
have
not
reduced
rates
in
the
san
joaquin
you
have
not
reduced
rates
between
bonneville
and
tidewater
i
repeat
sir
what
i
said
before
an
average
ten
per
cent
cut
lyman
answer
me
yes
or
no
have
you
reduced
the
bonneville
rate
it
could
not
be
done
so
soon
give
us
time
we
yes
or
no
by
god
sir
do
you
dare
equivocate
with
me
yes
or
no
have
you
reduced
the
bonneville
rate
and
answer
me
shouted
harran
leaning
far
across
the
table
answer
me
were
you
paid
by
the
railroad
to
leave
the
san
joaquin
rate
untouched
lyman
whiter
than
ever
turned
furious
upon
his
brother
do
you
dare
put
that
question
to
me
no
i
wo
cried
harran
because
i
tell
you
to
your
face
that
you
were
paid
to
do
on
the
instant
the
clamour
burst
forth
afresh
still
on
their
feet
the
ranchers
had
little
by
little
worked
around
the
table
magnus
alone
keeping
his
place
the
others
were
in
a
group
before
lyman
crowding
him
as
it
were
to
the
wall
shouting
into
his
face
with
menacing
gestures
the
truth
that
was
a
lie
the
certainty
of
a
trust
betrayed
a
pledge
ruthlessly
broken
was
plain
to
every
one
of
them
by
the
lord
men
have
been
shot
for
less
than
this
cried
osterman
you
sold
us
out
you
and
if
you
ever
bring
that
dago
face
of
yours
on
a
level
with
mine
again
i
slap
keep
your
hands
off
exclaimed
lyman
quickly
the
aggressiveness
of
the
cornered
rat
flaming
up
within
him
no
violence
do
you
go
too
how
much
were
you
paid
how
much
were
you
paid
vociferated
harran
yes
yes
what
was
your
price
cried
the
others
they
were
beside
themselves
with
anger
their
words
came
harsh
from
between
their
set
teeth
their
gestures
were
made
with
their
fists
clenched
you
know
the
commission
acted
in
good
faith
retorted
lyman
you
know
that
all
was
fair
and
above
liar
shouted
annixter
liar
you
were
bought
and
paid
for
and
with
the
words
his
arm
seemed
almost
of
itself
to
leap
out
from
his
shoulder
lyman
received
the
blow
squarely
in
the
face
and
the
force
of
it
sent
him
staggering
backwards
toward
the
wall
he
tripped
over
his
valise
and
fell
half
way
his
back
supported
against
the
closed
door
of
the
room
magnus
sprang
forward
his
son
had
been
struck
and
the
instincts
of
a
father
rose
up
in
instant
protest
rose
for
a
moment
then
forever
died
away
in
his
heart
he
checked
the
words
that
flashed
to
his
mind
he
lowered
his
upraised
arm
no
he
had
but
one
son
the
poor
staggering
creature
with
the
fine
clothes
white
face
and
lips
was
no
longer
his
a
blow
could
not
dishonour
him
more
than
he
had
dishonoured
himself
but
gethings
the
older
man
intervened
pulling
annixter
back
crying
stop
this
wo
do
not
before
his
i
am
no
father
to
this
man
gentlemen
exclaimed
magnus
from
now
on
i
have
but
one
son
you
sir
he
turned
to
lyman
you
sir
leave
my
lyman
his
handkerchief
to
his
lips
his
smart
cravat
in
disarray
caught
up
his
hat
and
coat
he
was
shaking
with
fury
his
protruding
eyes
were
he
swung
open
the
door
ruffians
he
shouted
from
the
threshold
ruffians
bullies
do
your
own
dirty
business
yourselves
after
this
i
done
with
you
how
is
it
all
of
a
sudden
you
talk
about
honour
how
is
it
that
all
at
once
so
clean
and
straight
you
were
so
particular
at
sacramento
just
before
the
nominations
how
was
the
board
elected
i
a
am
i
is
it
any
worse
than
giving
a
bribe
ask
magnus
derrick
what
he
thinks
about
that
ask
him
how
much
he
paid
the
democratic
bosses
at
sacramento
to
swing
the
he
went
out
slamming
the
door
presley
followed
the
whole
affair
made
him
sick
at
heart
filled
him
with
infinite
disgust
infinite
weariness
he
wished
to
get
away
from
it
all
he
left
the
and
the
excited
clamouring
men
behind
him
and
stepped
out
on
the
porch
of
the
ranch
house
closing
the
door
behind
him
lyman
was
nowhere
in
sight
presley
was
alone
it
was
late
and
after
the
air
of
the
the
coolness
of
the
night
was
delicious
and
its
vast
silence
after
the
noise
and
fury
of
the
committee
meeting
descended
from
the
stars
like
a
benediction
presley
stepped
to
the
edge
of
the
porch
looking
off
to
southward
and
there
before
him
mile
after
mile
illimitable
covering
the
earth
from
horizon
to
horizon
lay
the
wheat
the
growth
now
many
days
old
was
already
high
from
the
ground
there
it
lay
a
vast
silent
ocean
shimmering
a
pallid
green
under
the
moon
and
under
the
stars
a
mighty
force
the
strength
of
nations
the
life
of
the
world
there
in
the
night
under
the
dome
of
the
sky
it
was
growing
steadily
to
mind
the
scene
in
the
room
he
had
just
left
dwindled
to
paltry
insignificance
before
this
sight
ah
yes
the
wheat
it
was
over
this
that
the
railroad
the
ranchers
the
traitor
false
to
his
trust
all
the
members
of
an
obscure
conspiracy
were
wrangling
as
if
human
agency
could
affect
this
colossal
power
what
were
these
heated
tiny
squabbles
this
feverish
small
bustle
of
mankind
this
minute
swarming
of
the
human
insect
to
the
great
majestic
silent
ocean
of
the
wheat
itself
indifferent
gigantic
resistless
it
moved
in
its
appointed
grooves
men
liliputians
gnats
in
the
sunshine
buzzed
impudently
in
their
tiny
battles
were
born
lived
through
their
little
day
died
and
were
forgotten
while
the
wheat
wrapped
in
nirvanic
calm
grew
steadily
under
the
night
alone
with
the
stars
and
with
god
chapter
were
a
pest
that
year
and
presley
occasionally
found
amusement
in
hunting
them
with
harran
greyhounds
following
the
chase
on
horseback
one
day
between
two
and
three
months
after
lyman
s
visit
to
los
muertos
as
he
was
returning
toward
the
ranch
house
from
a
distant
and
lonely
quarter
of
los
muertos
he
came
unexpectedly
upon
a
strange
sight
some
twenty
men
annixter
and
osterman
tenants
and
small
ranchers
from
east
of
guadalajara
all
members
of
the
league
were
going
through
the
manual
of
arms
under
harran
derrick
supervision
they
were
all
equipped
with
new
winchester
rifles
harran
carried
one
of
these
himself
and
with
it
he
illustrated
the
various
commands
he
gave
as
soon
as
one
of
the
men
under
his
supervision
became
more
than
usually
proficient
he
was
told
off
to
instruct
a
file
of
the
more
backward
after
the
manual
of
arms
harran
gave
the
command
to
take
distance
as
skirmishers
and
when
the
line
had
opened
out
so
that
some
feet
intervened
between
each
man
an
advance
was
made
across
the
field
the
men
stooping
low
and
snapping
the
hammers
of
their
rifles
at
an
imaginary
enemy
the
league
had
its
agents
in
san
francisco
who
watched
the
movements
of
the
railroad
as
closely
as
was
possible
and
some
time
before
this
annixter
had
received
word
that
the
marshal
and
his
deputies
were
coming
down
to
bonneville
to
put
the
dummy
buyers
of
his
ranch
in
possession
the
report
proved
to
be
but
the
first
of
many
false
alarms
but
it
had
stimulated
the
league
to
unusual
activity
and
some
three
or
four
hundred
men
were
furnished
with
arms
and
from
time
to
time
were
drilled
in
secret
among
themselves
the
ranchers
said
that
if
the
railroad
managers
did
not
believe
they
were
terribly
in
earnest
in
the
stand
they
had
taken
they
were
making
a
fatal
mistake
harran
reasserted
this
statement
to
presley
on
the
way
home
to
the
ranch
house
that
same
day
harran
had
caught
up
with
him
by
the
time
he
reached
the
lower
road
and
the
two
jogged
homeward
through
the
miles
of
standing
wheat
they
may
jump
the
ranch
pres
he
said
if
they
try
hard
enough
but
they
will
never
do
it
while
i
am
alive
by
the
way
he
added
you
know
we
served
notices
yesterday
upon
behrman
and
cy
ruggles
to
quit
the
country
of
course
they
wo
do
it
but
they
wo
be
able
to
say
they
did
have
about
an
hour
later
the
two
reached
the
ranch
house
but
as
harran
rode
up
the
driveway
he
uttered
an
exclamation
hello
he
said
something
is
up
that
genslinger
in
fact
the
editor
team
was
tied
underneath
the
shade
of
a
giant
eucalyptus
tree
near
by
harran
uneasy
under
this
unexpected
visit
of
the
enemy
friend
dismounted
without
stabling
his
horse
and
went
at
once
to
the
where
visitors
were
invariably
received
but
the
was
empty
and
his
mother
told
him
that
magnus
and
the
editor
were
in
the
magnus
had
said
they
were
not
to
be
disturbed
earlier
in
the
afternoon
the
editor
had
driven
up
to
the
porch
and
had
asked
derrick
whom
he
found
reading
a
book
of
poems
on
the
porch
if
he
could
see
magnus
at
the
time
the
governor
had
gone
with
phelps
to
inspect
the
condition
of
the
young
wheat
on
hooven
holding
but
within
half
an
hour
he
returned
and
genslinger
had
asked
him
for
a
few
moments
talk
in
the
two
went
into
the
office
magnus
locking
the
door
behind
him
very
complete
you
are
here
governor
observed
the
editor
in
his
alert
jerky
manner
his
black
eyes
twinkling
around
the
room
from
behind
his
glasses
telephone
safe
ticker
well
that
progress
is
it
only
way
to
manage
a
big
ranch
these
days
but
the
day
of
the
big
ranch
is
over
as
the
land
appreciates
in
value
the
temptation
to
sell
off
small
holdings
will
be
too
strong
and
then
the
small
holding
can
be
cultivated
to
better
advantage
i
shall
have
an
editorial
on
that
some
the
cost
of
maintaining
a
number
of
small
holdings
said
magnus
indifferently
is
of
course
greater
than
if
they
were
all
under
one
that
may
be
that
may
be
rejoined
the
other
there
was
a
long
pause
genslinger
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
rubbed
a
knee
magnus
standing
erect
in
front
of
the
safe
waited
for
him
to
speak
this
is
an
unfortunate
business
governor
began
the
editor
this
misunderstanding
between
the
ranchers
and
the
railroad
i
wish
it
could
be
adjusted
here
are
two
industries
that
must
be
in
harmony
with
one
another
or
we
all
go
to
i
should
prefer
not
to
be
interviewed
on
the
subject
genslinger
said
magnus
oh
no
oh
no
lord
love
you
governor
i
do
want
to
interview
you
we
all
know
how
you
again
there
was
a
long
silence
magnus
wondered
what
this
little
man
usually
so
garrulous
could
want
of
him
at
length
genslinger
began
again
he
did
not
look
at
magnus
except
at
long
intervals
about
the
present
railroad
commission
he
remarked
that
was
an
interesting
campaign
you
conducted
in
sacramento
and
san
magnus
held
his
peace
his
hands
shut
tight
did
genslinger
know
of
lyman
disgrace
was
it
for
this
he
had
come
would
the
story
of
it
be
the
leading
article
in
mercury
an
interesting
campaign
repeated
genslinger
slowly
a
very
interesting
campaign
i
watched
it
with
every
degree
of
interest
i
saw
its
every
phase
the
campaign
was
not
without
its
interest
admitted
magnus
yes
said
genslinger
still
more
deliberately
and
some
phases
of
it
were
more
interesting
than
others
as
for
instance
let
us
say
the
way
in
which
you
personally
secured
the
votes
of
certain
chairmen
of
delegations
need
i
particularise
further
yes
those
men
the
way
you
got
their
votes
now
that
i
should
say
derrick
was
the
most
interesting
move
in
the
whole
game
to
you
hm
curious
he
murmured
musingly
let
see
you
deposited
two
dollar
bills
and
four
dollar
bills
in
a
box
three
hundred
and
eight
was
the
number
in
a
box
in
the
safety
deposit
vaults
in
san
francisco
and
then
let
see
you
gave
a
key
to
this
box
to
each
of
the
gentlemen
in
question
and
after
the
election
the
box
was
empty
now
i
call
that
interesting
curious
because
it
a
new
safe
and
highly
ingenious
method
of
bribery
how
did
you
happen
to
think
of
it
governor
do
you
know
what
you
are
doing
sir
magnus
burst
forth
do
you
know
what
you
are
insinuating
here
in
my
own
house
why
governor
returned
the
editor
blandly
i
not
insinuating
anything
i
talking
about
what
i
it
a
genslinger
rubbed
his
chin
reflectively
well
he
answered
you
can
have
a
chance
to
prove
it
before
the
grand
jury
if
you
want
my
character
is
known
all
over
the
state
blustered
magnus
my
politics
are
pure
politics
my
no
one
needs
a
better
reputation
for
pure
politics
than
the
man
who
sets
out
to
be
a
briber
interrupted
genslinger
and
i
might
as
well
tell
you
governor
that
you
ca
shout
me
down
i
can
put
my
hand
on
the
two
chairmen
you
bought
before
it
dark
i
had
their
depositions
in
my
safe
for
the
last
six
weeks
we
could
make
the
arrests
if
we
wanted
governor
you
sure
did
a
risky
thing
when
you
went
into
that
sacramento
fight
an
awful
risky
thing
some
men
can
afford
to
have
bribery
charges
preferred
against
them
and
it
do
hurt
one
little
bit
but
you
lord
it
would
bust
you
governor
bust
you
dead
i
know
all
about
the
whole
shananigan
business
from
a
to
z
and
if
you
do
believe
it
here
he
drew
a
long
strip
of
paper
from
his
pocket
here
a
galley
proof
of
the
magnus
took
it
in
his
hands
there
under
his
eyes
the
more
important
clauses
printed
in
bold
type
was
the
detailed
account
of
the
deal
magnus
had
made
with
the
two
delegates
it
was
pitiless
remorseless
bald
every
statement
was
substantiated
every
statistic
verified
with
genslinger
meticulous
love
for
exactness
besides
all
that
it
had
the
ring
of
truth
it
was
exposure
ruin
absolute
annihilation
that
about
correct
is
it
commented
genslinger
as
derrick
finished
reading
magnus
did
not
reply
i
think
it
is
correct
enough
the
editor
continued
but
i
thought
it
would
only
be
fair
to
you
to
let
you
see
it
before
it
was
the
one
thought
uppermost
in
derrick
mind
his
one
impulse
of
the
moment
was
at
whatever
cost
to
preserve
his
dignity
not
to
allow
this
man
to
exult
in
the
sight
of
one
quiver
of
weakness
one
trace
of
defeat
one
suggestion
of
humiliation
by
an
effort
that
put
all
his
iron
rigidity
to
the
test
he
forced
himself
to
look
straight
into
genslinger
eyes
i
congratulate
you
he
observed
handing
back
the
proof
upon
your
journalistic
enterprise
your
paper
will
sell
oh
i
do
know
as
i
want
to
publish
this
story
remarked
the
editor
indifferently
putting
away
the
galley
i
just
like
that
the
fun
for
me
is
running
a
good
story
to
earth
but
once
i
got
it
i
lose
interest
and
then
i
would
like
to
see
you
holding
the
position
you
do
president
of
the
league
and
a
leading
man
of
the
county
i
would
like
to
see
a
story
like
this
smash
you
over
it
worth
more
to
you
to
keep
it
out
of
print
than
for
me
to
put
it
in
i
got
nothing
much
to
gain
but
a
few
extra
editions
but
you
lord
you
would
lose
everything
your
committee
was
in
the
deal
right
enough
but
your
league
all
the
san
joaquin
valley
everybody
in
the
state
believes
the
commissioners
were
fairly
your
story
suddenly
exclaimed
magnus
struck
with
an
idea
will
be
thoroughly
discredited
just
so
soon
as
the
new
grain
tariff
is
published
i
have
means
of
knowing
that
the
san
joaquin
rate
the
issue
upon
which
the
board
was
elected
is
not
to
be
touched
is
it
likely
the
ranchers
would
secure
the
election
of
a
board
that
plays
them
false
oh
we
know
all
about
that
answered
genslinger
smiling
you
thought
you
were
electing
lyman
easily
you
thought
you
had
got
the
railroad
to
walk
right
into
your
trap
you
did
understand
how
you
could
pull
off
your
deal
so
easily
why
governor
lyman
was
pledged
to
the
railroad
two
years
ago
he
was
the
one
particular
man
the
corporation
wanted
for
commissioner
and
your
people
elected
him
saved
the
railroad
all
the
trouble
of
campaigning
for
him
and
you
ca
make
any
counter
charge
of
bribery
there
no
sir
the
corporation
do
use
such
amateurish
methods
as
that
confidentially
and
between
us
two
all
that
the
railroad
has
done
for
lyman
in
order
to
attach
him
to
their
interests
is
to
promise
to
back
him
politically
in
the
next
campaign
for
governor
it
too
bad
he
continued
dropping
his
voice
and
changing
his
position
it
really
is
too
bad
to
see
good
men
trying
to
bunt
a
stone
wall
over
with
their
bare
heads
you
could
have
won
at
any
stage
of
the
game
i
wish
i
could
have
talked
to
you
and
your
friends
before
you
went
into
that
sacramento
fight
i
could
have
told
you
then
how
little
chance
you
had
when
will
you
people
realise
that
you
ca
buck
against
the
railroad
why
magnus
it
like
me
going
out
in
a
paper
boat
and
shooting
peas
at
a
is
that
all
you
wished
to
see
me
about
genslinger
remarked
magnus
bestirring
himself
i
am
rather
occupied
well
returned
the
other
you
know
what
the
publication
of
this
article
would
mean
for
he
paused
again
took
off
his
glasses
breathed
on
them
polished
the
lenses
with
his
handkerchief
and
readjusted
them
on
his
nose
i
been
thinking
governor
he
began
again
with
renewed
alertness
and
quite
irrelevantly
of
enlarging
the
scope
of
the
you
see
i
midway
between
the
two
big
centres
of
the
state
san
francisco
and
los
angeles
and
i
want
to
extend
the
sphere
of
influence
as
far
up
and
down
the
valley
as
i
can
i
want
to
illustrate
the
paper
you
see
if
i
had
a
plant
of
my
own
i
could
do
a
good
deal
of
outside
jobbing
as
well
and
the
investment
would
pay
ten
per
cent
but
it
takes
money
to
make
money
i
would
want
to
put
in
any
dinky
affair
i
want
a
good
plant
i
been
figuring
out
the
business
besides
the
plant
there
would
be
the
expense
of
a
high
grade
paper
ca
print
on
anything
but
coated
paper
and
that
costs
well
what
with
this
and
with
that
and
running
expenses
till
the
thing
began
to
pay
it
would
cost
me
about
ten
thousand
dollars
and
i
was
wondering
if
perhaps
you
could
see
your
way
clear
to
accommodating
ten
thousand
yes
say
five
thousand
down
and
the
balance
within
sixty
magnus
for
the
moment
blind
to
what
genslinger
had
in
mind
turned
on
him
in
astonishment
why
man
what
security
could
you
give
me
for
such
an
amount
well
to
tell
the
truth
answered
the
editor
i
had
thought
much
about
securities
in
fact
i
believed
you
would
see
how
greatly
it
was
to
your
advantage
to
talk
business
with
me
you
see
i
not
going
to
print
this
article
about
you
governor
and
i
not
going
to
let
it
get
out
so
as
any
one
else
can
print
it
and
it
seems
to
me
that
one
good
turn
deserves
another
you
understand
magnus
understood
an
overwhelming
desire
suddenly
took
possession
of
him
to
grip
this
blackmailer
by
the
throat
to
strangle
him
where
he
stood
or
if
not
at
least
to
turn
upon
him
with
that
terrible
anger
before
which
whole
conventions
had
once
cowered
but
in
the
same
moment
the
governor
realised
this
was
not
to
be
only
its
righteousness
had
made
his
wrath
terrible
only
the
justice
of
his
anger
had
made
him
feared
now
the
foundation
was
gone
from
under
his
feet
he
had
knocked
it
away
himself
three
times
feeble
was
he
whose
quarrel
was
unjust
before
this
country
editor
this
paid
speaker
of
the
railroad
he
stood
convicted
the
man
had
him
at
his
mercy
the
detected
briber
could
not
resent
an
insult
genslinger
rose
smoothing
his
hat
well
he
said
of
course
you
want
time
to
think
it
over
and
you
ca
raise
money
like
that
on
short
notice
i
wait
till
friday
noon
of
this
week
we
begin
to
set
saturday
paper
at
about
four
friday
afternoon
and
the
forms
are
locked
about
two
in
the
morning
i
hope
he
added
turning
back
at
the
door
of
the
room
that
you
wo
find
anything
disagreeable
in
your
saturday
morning
he
went
out
closing
the
door
behind
him
and
in
a
moment
magnus
heard
the
wheels
of
his
buckboard
grating
on
the
driveway
the
following
morning
brought
a
letter
to
magnus
from
gethings
of
the
san
pueblo
ranch
which
was
situated
very
close
to
visalia
the
letter
was
to
the
effect
that
all
around
visalia
upon
the
ranches
affected
by
the
regrade
of
the
railroad
men
were
arming
and
drilling
and
that
the
strength
of
the
league
in
that
quarter
was
undoubted
but
to
refer
continued
the
letter
to
a
most
painful
recollection
you
will
no
doubt
remember
that
at
the
close
of
our
last
committee
meeting
specific
charges
were
made
as
to
fraud
in
the
nomination
and
election
of
one
of
our
commissioners
emanating
most
unfortunately
from
the
commissioner
himself
these
charges
my
dear
derrick
were
directed
at
yourself
how
the
secrets
of
the
committee
have
been
noised
about
i
can
not
understand
you
may
be
of
course
assured
of
my
own
unquestioning
confidence
and
loyalty
however
i
regret
exceedingly
to
state
not
only
that
the
rumour
of
the
charges
referred
to
above
is
spreading
in
this
district
but
that
also
they
are
made
use
of
by
the
enemies
of
the
league
it
is
to
be
deplored
that
some
of
the
leaguers
themselves
you
know
we
number
in
our
ranks
many
small
farmers
ignorant
portuguese
and
foreigners
have
listened
to
these
stories
and
have
permitted
a
feeling
of
uneasiness
to
develop
among
them
even
though
it
were
admitted
that
fraudulent
means
had
been
employed
in
the
elections
which
of
course
i
personally
do
not
admit
i
do
not
think
it
would
make
very
much
difference
in
the
confidence
which
the
vast
majority
of
the
leaguers
repose
in
their
chiefs
yet
we
have
so
insisted
upon
the
probity
of
our
position
as
opposed
to
railroad
chicanery
that
i
believe
it
advisable
to
quell
this
distant
suspicion
at
once
to
publish
a
denial
of
these
rumoured
charges
would
only
be
to
give
them
too
much
importance
however
can
you
not
write
me
a
letter
stating
exactly
how
the
campaign
was
conducted
and
the
commission
nominated
and
elected
i
could
show
this
to
some
of
the
more
disaffected
and
it
would
serve
to
allay
all
suspicion
on
the
instant
i
think
it
would
be
well
to
write
as
though
the
initiative
came
not
from
me
but
from
yourself
ignoring
this
present
letter
i
offer
this
only
as
a
suggestion
and
will
confidently
endorse
any
decision
you
may
arrive
the
letter
closed
with
renewed
protestations
of
confidence
magnus
was
alone
when
he
read
this
he
put
it
carefully
away
in
the
filing
cabinet
in
his
office
and
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
forehead
and
face
he
stood
for
one
moment
his
hands
rigid
at
his
sides
his
fists
clinched
this
is
piling
up
he
muttered
looking
blankly
at
the
opposite
wall
my
god
this
is
piling
up
what
am
i
to
do
ah
the
bitterness
of
unavailing
regret
the
anguish
of
compromise
with
conscience
the
remorse
of
a
bad
deed
done
in
a
moment
of
excitement
ah
the
humiliation
of
detection
the
degradation
of
being
caught
caught
like
a
schoolboy
pilfering
his
fellows
desks
and
worse
than
all
worse
than
all
the
consciousness
of
lost
the
knowledge
of
a
prestige
vanishing
a
dignity
impaired
knowledge
that
the
grip
which
held
a
multitude
in
check
was
trembling
that
control
was
wavering
that
command
was
being
weakened
then
the
little
tricks
to
deceive
the
crowd
the
little
subterfuges
the
little
pretences
that
kept
up
appearances
the
lies
the
bluster
the
pose
the
strut
the
gasconade
where
once
was
iron
authority
the
turning
of
the
head
so
as
not
to
see
that
which
could
not
be
prevented
the
suspicion
of
suspicion
the
haunting
fear
of
the
man
on
the
street
the
uneasiness
of
the
direct
glance
the
questioning
as
to
motives
why
had
this
been
said
what
was
meant
by
that
word
that
gesture
that
glance
wednesday
passed
and
thursday
magnus
kept
to
himself
seeing
no
visitors
avoiding
even
his
family
how
to
break
through
the
mesh
of
the
net
how
to
regain
the
old
position
how
to
prevent
discovery
if
there
were
only
some
way
some
vast
superhuman
effort
by
which
he
could
rise
in
his
old
strength
once
more
crushing
lyman
with
one
hand
genslinger
with
the
other
and
for
one
more
moment
the
last
to
stand
supreme
again
indomitable
the
leader
then
go
to
his
death
triumphant
at
the
end
his
memory
untarnished
his
fame
undimmed
but
the
was
in
himself
knitted
forever
into
the
fabric
of
his
being
though
genslinger
should
be
silenced
though
lyman
should
be
crushed
though
even
the
league
should
overcome
the
railroad
though
he
should
be
the
acknowledged
leader
of
a
resplendent
victory
yet
the
would
remain
there
was
no
success
for
him
now
however
conspicuous
the
outward
achievement
he
he
himself
magnus
derrick
had
failed
miserably
and
irredeemably
petty
material
complications
intruded
sordid
considerations
even
if
genslinger
was
to
be
paid
where
was
the
money
to
come
from
his
legal
battles
with
the
railroad
extending
now
over
a
period
of
many
years
had
cost
him
dear
his
plan
of
sowing
all
of
los
muertos
to
wheat
discharging
the
tenants
had
proved
expensive
the
campaign
resulting
in
lyman
election
had
drawn
heavily
upon
his
account
all
along
he
had
been
relying
upon
a
bonanza
crop
to
reimburse
him
it
was
not
believable
that
the
railroad
would
jump
los
muertos
but
if
this
should
happen
he
would
be
left
without
resources
ten
thousand
dollars
could
he
raise
the
amount
possibly
but
to
pay
it
out
to
a
blackmailer
to
be
held
up
thus
in
fashion
without
a
single
means
of
redress
would
it
not
cripple
him
financially
genslinger
could
do
his
worst
he
magnus
would
brave
it
out
was
not
his
character
above
suspicion
was
it
this
letter
of
gethings
already
the
murmur
of
uneasiness
made
itself
heard
was
this
not
the
thin
edge
of
the
wedge
how
the
publication
of
genslinger
story
would
drive
it
home
how
the
spark
of
suspicion
would
flare
into
the
blaze
of
open
accusation
there
would
be
investigations
investigation
there
was
terror
in
the
word
he
could
not
stand
investigation
magnus
groaned
aloud
covering
his
head
with
his
clasped
hands
briber
corrupter
of
government
stuffer
descending
to
the
level
of
politicians
of
heelers
he
magnus
derrick
statesman
of
the
old
school
roman
in
his
iron
integrity
abandoning
a
career
rather
than
enter
the
new
politics
had
in
one
moment
of
weakness
hazarding
all
even
honour
on
a
single
stake
taking
great
chances
to
achieve
great
results
swept
away
the
work
of
a
lifetime
gambler
that
he
was
he
had
at
last
chanced
his
highest
stake
his
personal
honour
in
the
greatest
game
of
his
life
and
had
lost
it
was
presley
morbidly
keen
observation
that
first
noticed
the
evidence
of
a
new
trouble
in
the
governor
face
and
manner
presley
was
sure
that
lyman
defection
had
not
so
upset
him
the
morning
after
the
committee
meeting
magnus
had
called
harran
and
annie
derrick
into
the
office
and
after
telling
his
wife
of
lyman
betrayal
had
forbidden
either
of
them
to
mention
his
name
again
his
attitude
towards
his
prodigal
son
was
that
of
stern
unrelenting
resentment
but
now
presley
could
not
fail
to
detect
traces
of
a
more
travail
something
was
in
the
wind
the
times
were
troublous
what
next
was
about
to
happen
what
fresh
calamity
impended
one
morning
toward
the
very
end
of
the
week
presley
woke
early
in
his
small
iron
bed
he
hastened
to
get
up
and
dress
there
was
much
to
be
done
that
day
until
late
the
night
before
he
had
been
at
work
on
a
collection
of
some
of
his
verses
gathered
from
the
magazines
in
which
they
had
first
appeared
presley
had
received
a
liberal
offer
for
the
publication
of
these
verses
in
book
form
the
toilers
was
to
be
included
in
this
book
and
indeed
was
to
give
it
its
name
the
toilers
and
other
thus
it
was
that
until
the
previous
midnight
he
had
been
preparing
the
collection
for
publication
revising
annotating
arranging
the
book
was
to
be
sent
off
that
morning
but
also
presley
had
received
a
typewritten
note
from
annixter
inviting
him
to
quien
sabe
that
same
day
annixter
explained
that
it
was
birthday
and
that
he
had
planned
a
picnic
on
the
high
ground
of
his
ranch
at
the
headwaters
of
broderson
creek
they
were
to
go
in
the
hilma
presley
dyke
sidney
and
himself
and
were
to
make
a
day
of
it
they
would
leave
quien
sabe
at
ten
in
the
morning
presley
had
at
once
resolved
to
go
he
was
immensely
fond
of
annixter
more
so
than
ever
since
his
marriage
with
hilma
and
the
astonishing
transformation
of
his
character
hilma
as
well
was
delightful
as
annixter
and
dyke
and
the
little
tad
had
always
been
his
friends
he
would
have
a
good
time
but
nobody
was
to
go
into
bonneville
that
morning
with
the
mail
and
if
he
wished
to
send
his
manuscript
he
would
have
to
take
it
in
himself
he
had
resolved
to
do
this
getting
an
early
start
and
going
on
horseback
to
quien
sabe
by
way
of
bonneville
it
was
barely
six
when
presley
sat
down
to
his
coffee
and
eggs
in
the
of
los
muertos
the
day
promised
to
be
hot
and
for
the
first
time
presley
had
put
on
a
new
khaki
riding
suit
very
though
in
place
of
the
regulation
he
wore
his
laced
with
a
great
spur
on
the
left
heel
harran
joined
him
at
breakfast
in
his
working
clothes
of
blue
canvas
he
was
bound
for
the
irrigating
ditch
to
see
how
the
work
was
getting
on
there
how
is
the
wheat
looking
asked
presley
bully
answered
the
other
stirring
his
coffee
the
governor
has
had
his
usual
luck
practically
every
acre
of
the
ranch
was
sown
to
wheat
and
everywhere
the
stand
is
good
i
was
over
on
two
day
before
yesterday
and
if
nothing
happens
i
believe
it
will
go
thirty
sacks
to
the
acre
there
cutter
reports
that
there
are
spots
on
four
where
we
will
get
or
three
hooven
too
brought
up
some
wonderful
fine
ears
for
me
to
look
at
the
grains
were
just
beginning
to
show
some
of
the
ears
carried
twenty
grains
that
means
nearly
forty
bushels
of
wheat
to
every
acre
i
call
it
a
bonanza
have
you
got
any
mail
said
presley
rising
i
going
into
harran
shook
his
head
and
took
himself
away
and
presley
went
down
to
the
to
get
his
pony
as
he
rode
out
of
the
and
passed
by
the
ranch
house
on
the
driveway
he
was
surprised
to
see
magnus
on
the
lowest
step
of
the
porch
good
morning
governor
called
presley
are
you
up
pretty
early
good
morning
pres
my
the
governor
came
forward
and
putting
his
hand
on
the
pony
withers
walked
along
by
his
side
going
to
town
pres
he
asked
yes
sir
can
i
do
anything
for
you
governor
magnus
drew
a
sealed
envelope
from
his
pocket
i
wish
you
would
drop
in
at
the
office
of
the
mercury
for
me
he
said
and
see
genslinger
personally
and
give
him
this
envelope
it
is
a
package
of
papers
but
they
involve
a
considerable
sum
of
money
and
you
must
be
careful
of
them
a
few
years
ago
when
our
enmity
was
not
so
strong
genslinger
and
i
had
some
business
dealings
with
each
other
i
thought
it
as
well
just
now
considering
that
we
are
so
openly
opposed
to
terminate
the
whole
affair
and
break
off
relations
we
came
to
a
settlement
a
few
days
ago
these
are
the
final
papers
they
must
be
given
to
him
in
person
presley
you
presley
cantered
on
turning
into
the
county
road
and
holding
northward
by
the
mammoth
watering
tank
and
broderson
popular
windbreak
as
he
passed
caraher
he
saw
the
in
the
doorway
of
his
place
and
waved
him
a
salutation
which
the
other
returned
by
degrees
presley
had
come
to
consider
caraher
in
a
more
favourable
light
he
found
to
his
immense
astonishment
that
caraher
knew
something
of
mill
and
bakounin
not
however
from
their
books
but
from
extracts
and
quotations
from
their
writings
reprinted
in
the
anarchistic
journals
to
which
he
subscribed
more
than
once
the
two
had
held
long
conversations
and
from
caraher
own
lips
presley
heard
the
terrible
story
of
the
death
of
his
wife
who
had
been
accidentally
killed
by
pinkertons
during
a
demonstration
of
strikers
it
invested
the
in
presley
imagination
with
all
the
dignity
of
the
tragedy
he
could
not
blame
caraher
for
being
a
he
even
wondered
how
it
was
the
had
not
put
his
theories
into
practice
and
adjusted
his
ancient
wrong
with
his
six
inches
of
plugged
presley
began
to
conceive
of
the
man
as
a
you
wait
presley
the
had
once
said
when
presley
had
protested
against
his
radical
ideas
you
do
know
the
railroad
yet
watch
it
and
its
doings
long
enough
and
you
come
over
to
my
way
of
thinking
it
was
about
seven
when
presley
reached
bonneville
the
business
part
of
the
town
was
as
yet
hardly
astir
he
despatched
his
manuscript
and
then
hurried
to
the
office
of
the
genslinger
as
he
feared
had
not
yet
put
in
appearance
but
the
janitor
of
the
building
gave
presley
the
address
of
the
editor
residence
and
it
was
there
he
found
him
in
the
act
of
sitting
down
to
breakfast
presley
was
hardly
courteous
to
the
little
man
and
abruptly
refused
his
offer
of
a
drink
he
delivered
magnus
envelope
to
him
and
departed
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
it
would
not
do
to
present
himself
at
quien
sabe
on
hilma
birthday
and
on
leaving
house
he
turned
his
pony
head
toward
the
business
part
of
the
town
again
pulling
up
in
front
of
the
jeweller
just
as
the
clerk
was
taking
down
the
shutters
at
the
jeweller
he
purchased
a
little
brooch
for
hilma
and
at
the
cigar
stand
in
the
lobby
of
the
yosemite
house
a
box
of
superfine
cigars
which
when
it
was
too
late
he
realised
that
the
master
of
quien
sabe
would
never
smoke
holding
as
he
did
with
defiant
inconsistency
to
miserable
weeds
black
bitter
and
flagrantly
doctored
which
he
bought
three
for
a
nickel
at
guadalajara
presley
arrived
at
quien
sabe
nearly
half
an
hour
behind
the
appointed
time
but
as
he
had
expected
the
party
were
in
no
way
ready
to
start
the
its
horses
covered
with
white
stood
under
a
tree
near
the
house
young
vacca
dozing
on
the
seat
hilma
and
sidney
the
latter
exuberant
with
a
gayety
that
all
but
brought
the
tears
to
presley
eyes
were
making
sandwiches
on
the
back
porch
dyke
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
and
annixter
was
shaving
himself
in
his
bedroom
this
latter
put
a
face
out
of
the
window
as
presley
cantered
through
the
gate
and
waved
his
razor
with
a
beckoning
motion
come
on
in
pres
he
cried
nobody
ready
yet
you
hours
ahead
of
presley
came
into
the
bedroom
his
huge
spur
clinking
on
the
straw
matting
annixter
was
without
coat
vest
or
collar
his
blue
silk
suspenders
hung
in
loops
over
either
hip
his
hair
was
disordered
the
crown
lock
stiffer
than
ever
glad
to
see
you
old
boy
he
announced
as
presley
came
in
no
shake
hands
i
all
lather
here
find
a
chair
will
you
i
wo
be
i
thought
you
said
ten
observed
presley
sitting
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
well
i
did
but
but
then
again
in
a
way
you
did
hey
his
friend
interrupted
annixter
grunted
and
turned
to
strop
his
razor
presley
looked
with
suspicious
disfavour
at
his
suspenders
why
is
it
he
observed
that
as
soon
as
a
man
is
about
to
get
married
he
buys
himself
pale
blue
suspenders
silk
ones
think
of
it
you
buck
annixter
with
silk
suspenders
it
ought
to
be
a
strap
and
a
old
fool
observed
annixter
whose
repartee
was
the
heaving
of
brick
bats
say
he
continued
holding
the
razor
from
his
face
and
jerking
his
head
over
his
shoulder
while
he
looked
at
presley
reflection
in
his
mirror
say
look
around
is
this
a
nifty
little
room
we
refitted
the
whole
house
you
know
notice
she
all
painted
i
have
been
looking
around
answered
presley
sweeping
the
room
with
a
series
of
glances
he
forebore
criticism
annixter
was
so
boyishly
proud
of
the
effect
that
it
would
have
been
unkind
to
have
undeceived
him
presley
looked
at
the
marvellous
bed
of
brass
with
its
brave
gay
canopy
the
with
its
pitcher
and
bowl
of
blinding
red
and
green
china
the
lithographs
of
symbolic
female
figures
against
the
new
the
inadequate
spindle
chairs
of
white
and
gold
the
sphere
of
tissue
paper
hanging
from
the
gas
fixture
and
the
plumes
of
pampas
grass
tacked
to
the
wall
at
artistic
angles
and
overhanging
two
astonishing
oil
paintings
in
dazzling
golden
frames
say
how
about
those
paintings
pres
inquired
annixter
a
little
uneasily
i
do
know
whether
they
good
or
not
they
were
painted
by
a
chinaman
in
monterey
and
i
got
the
lot
for
thirty
dollars
frames
thrown
in
why
i
think
the
frames
alone
are
worth
thirty
well
so
do
i
declared
presley
he
hastened
to
change
the
subject
buck
he
said
i
hear
you
brought
dyke
and
sidney
to
live
with
you
you
know
i
think
that
rather
white
of
oh
rot
pres
muttered
annixter
turning
abruptly
to
his
shaving
and
you
ca
fool
me
either
old
man
presley
continued
giving
this
picnic
as
much
for
dyke
and
the
little
tad
as
you
are
for
your
wife
just
to
cheer
them
up
a
oh
pshaw
you
make
me
well
that
the
right
thing
to
do
buck
and
i
as
glad
for
your
sake
as
i
am
for
theirs
there
was
a
time
when
you
would
have
let
them
all
go
to
grass
and
never
so
much
as
thought
of
them
i
do
want
to
seem
to
be
officious
but
you
changed
for
the
better
old
man
and
i
guess
i
know
why
she
presley
caught
his
friend
eye
and
added
gravely
she
a
good
woman
annixter
turned
around
abruptly
his
face
flushing
under
its
lather
pres
he
exclaimed
she
made
a
man
of
me
i
was
a
machine
before
and
if
another
man
or
woman
or
child
got
in
my
way
i
rode
down
and
i
never
dreamed
of
anybody
else
but
myself
but
as
soon
as
i
woke
up
to
the
fact
that
i
really
loved
her
why
it
was
glory
hallelujah
all
in
a
minute
and
in
a
way
i
kind
of
loved
everybody
then
and
wanted
to
be
everybody
friend
and
i
began
to
see
that
a
fellow
ca
live
for
himself
any
more
than
he
can
live
by
himself
he
got
to
think
of
others
if
he
got
brains
he
got
to
think
for
the
poor
ducks
that
have
and
not
give
a
boot
in
the
backsides
because
they
happen
to
be
stupid
and
if
he
got
money
he
got
to
help
those
that
are
busted
and
if
he
got
a
house
he
got
to
think
of
those
that
ai
got
anywhere
to
go
i
got
a
whole
lot
of
ideas
since
i
began
to
love
hilma
and
just
as
soon
as
i
can
i
going
to
get
in
and
help
people
and
i
going
to
keep
to
that
idea
the
rest
of
my
natural
life
that
ai
much
of
a
religion
but
it
the
best
i
got
and
henry
ward
beecher
could
do
any
more
than
that
and
it
all
come
about
because
of
hilma
and
because
we
cared
for
each
presley
jumped
up
and
caught
annixter
about
the
shoulders
with
one
arm
gripping
his
hand
hard
this
absurd
figure
with
dangling
silk
suspenders
lathered
chin
and
tearful
eyes
seemed
to
be
suddenly
invested
with
true
nobility
beside
this
blundering
struggle
to
do
right
to
help
his
fellows
presley
own
vague
schemes
glittering
systems
of
reconstruction
collapsed
to
ruin
and
he
himself
with
all
his
refinement
with
all
his
poetry
culture
and
education
stood
a
bungler
at
the
world
workbench
you
all
right
old
man
he
exclaimed
unable
to
think
of
anything
adequate
you
all
right
that
the
way
to
talk
and
here
by
the
way
i
brought
you
a
box
of
annixter
stared
as
presley
laid
the
box
on
the
edge
of
the
washstand
old
fool
he
remarked
what
in
hell
did
you
do
that
for
oh
just
for
i
suppose
they
rotten
stinkodoras
or
you
would
give
this
cringing
gratitude
presley
began
shut
up
shouted
annixter
and
the
incident
was
closed
annixter
resumed
his
shaving
and
presley
lit
a
cigarette
any
news
from
washington
he
queried
nothing
that
any
good
grunted
annixter
hello
he
added
raising
his
head
there
somebody
in
a
hurry
for
the
noise
of
a
horse
galloping
so
fast
that
the
sounded
in
one
uninterrupted
rattle
abruptly
made
itself
heard
the
noise
was
coming
from
the
direction
of
the
road
that
led
from
the
mission
to
quien
sabe
with
incredible
swiftness
the
drew
nearer
there
was
that
in
their
sound
which
brought
presley
to
his
feet
annixter
threw
open
the
window
runaway
exclaimed
presley
annixter
with
thoughts
of
the
railroad
and
the
jumping
of
the
ranch
flung
his
hand
to
his
hip
pocket
what
is
it
vacca
he
cried
young
vacca
turning
in
his
seat
in
the
carryall

looking
up
the
road
all
at

he
jumped
from
his
place
and
dashed
towards
the
window
dyke
he
shouted
dyke
it
while
the
words
were
yet
in
his
mouth
the
sound
of
the
rose
to
a
roar
and
a
great
voice
shouted
annixter
annixter
annixter
it
was
dyke
voice
and
the
next
instant
he
shot
into
view
in
the
open
square
in
front
of
the
house
oh

god
cried
presley
the
threw
the
horse
on
its
haunches
springing
from
the
saddle
and
as
he
did
so
the
beast
collapsed
shuddering
to
the
ground
annixter
sprang
from
the
window
and
ran
forward
presley
following
there
was
dyke
hatless
his
pistol
in
his
hand
a
gaunt
terrible
figure
the
beard
immeasurably
long
the
cheeks
fallen
in
the
eyes
sunken
his
clothes
ripped
and
torn
by
weeks
of
flight
and
hiding
in
the
chaparral
were
ragged
beyond

the
boots

shreds
of
leather
bloody
to
the
ankle
with
furious
spurring
annixter
he
shouted
and
again
rolling
his
sunken
eyes
annixter

with
the
excitement
of
the
men
who
surrounded
her
the
buckskin
cleared
the
in
two
leaps
then
gathering
her
legs
under
her
her
head
low
her
neck
stretched
out
swung
into
the
road
from
out
the
driveway
disappearing
in
a
blur
of
dust
with
the
agility
of
a
monkey
young
vacca
swung
himself
into
the
framework
of
the
artesian
well
clambering
aloft
to
its
very
top
he
swept
the
country
with
a
glance
well
demanded
annixter
from
the
ground
the
others
cocked
their
heads
to
listen
i
see
him
i
see
him
shouted
vacca
he
going
like
the
devil
headed
for
look
back
up
the
road
toward
the
mission
anything
there
the
answer
came
down
in
a
shout
of
apprehension
there
a
party
of
men
three
or
four
on
there
dogs
with
they
coming
this
way
oh
i
can
hear
the
dogs
and
say
oh
say
there
another
party
coming
down
the
lower
road
going
towards
guadalajara
too
they
got
guns
i
can
see
the
shine
of
the
barrels
and
oh
lord
say
there
three
more
men
on
horses
coming
down
on
the
jump
from
the
hills
on
the
los
muertos
stock
range
they
making
towards
guadalajara
and
i
can
hear
the
courthouse
bell
in
bonneville
ringing
say
the
whole
county
is
as
young
vacca
slid
down
to
the
ground
two
small
hounds
with
flapping
ears
and
lolling
tongues
loped
into
view
on
the
road
in
front
of
the
house
they
were
grey
with
dust
their
noses
were
to
the
ground
at
the
gate
where
dyke
had
turned
into
the
ranch
house
grounds
they
halted
in
confusion
a
moment
one
started
to
follow
the
highwayman
trail
towards
the
stable
corral
but
the
other
quartering
over
the
road
with
lightning
swiftness
suddenly
picked
up
the
new
scent
leading
on
towards
guadalajara
he
tossed
his
head
in
the
air
and
presley
abruptly
shut
his
hands
over
his
ears
ah
that
terrible
cry
reverberating
like
the
bourdon
of
a
great
bell
it
was
the
trackers
exulting
on
the
trail
of
the
pursued
the
prolonged
raucous
howl
eager
ominous
vibrating
with
the
alarm
of
the
tocsin
sullen
with
the
heavy
muffling
note
of
death
but
close
upon
the
bay
of
the
hounds
came
the
gallop
of
horses
five
men
their
eyes
upon
the
hounds
their
rifles
across
their
pommels
their
horses
reeking
and
black
with
sweat
swept
by
in
a
storm
of
dust
glinting
hoofs
and
streaming
manes
that
was
delaney
gang
exclaimed
annixter
i
saw
the
other
was
that
chap
christian
said
vacca
s
behrman
cousin
he
had
two
deputies
with
him
and
the
chap
in
the
white
slouch
hat
was
the
sheriff
from
by
the
lord
they
are
far
behind
declared
annixter
as
the
men
turned
towards
the
house
again
they
saw
hilma
and
dyke
in
the
doorway
of
the
little
house
where
the
latter
lived
they
were
looking
out
bewildered
ignorant
of
what
had
happened
but
on
the
porch
of
the
ranch
house
itself
alone
forgotten
in
the
excitement
sidney
the
little
tad
stood
with
pale
face
and
serious
eyes
she
had
seen
everything
and
had
understood
she
said
nothing
her
head
inclined
towards
the
roadway
she
listened
to
the
faint
and
distant
baying
of
the
dogs
dyke
thundered
across
the
railway
tracks
by
the
depot
at
guadalajara
not
five
minutes
ahead
of
his
pursuers
luck
seemed
to
have
deserted
him
the
station
usually
so
quiet
was
now
occupied
by
the
crew
of
a
freight
train
that
lay
on
the
down
track
while
on
the
up
line
near
at
hand
and
headed
in
the
same
direction
was
a
detached
locomotive
whose
engineer
and
fireman
recognized
him
he
was
sure
as
the
buckskin
leaped
across
the
rails
he
had
had
no
time
to
formulate
a
plan
since
that
morning
when
tortured
with
thirst
he
had
ventured
near
the
spring
at
the
headwaters
of
broderson
creek
on
quien
sabe
and
had
all
but
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
posse
that
had
been
watching
for
that
very
move
it
was
useless
now
to
regret
that
he
had
tried
to
foil
pursuit
by
turning
back
on
his
tracks
to
regain
the
mountains
east
of
bonneville
now
delaney
was
almost
on
him
to
distance
that
posse
was
the
only
thing
to
be
thought
of
now
it
was
no
longer
a
question
of
hiding
till
pursuit
should
flag
they
had
driven
him
out
from
the
shelter
of
the
mountains
down
into
this
populous
countryside
where
an
enemy
might
be
met
with
at
every
turn
of
the
road
now
it
was
life
or
death
he
would
either
escape
or
be
killed
he
knew
very
well
that
he
would
never
allow
himself
to
be
taken
alive
but
he
had
no
mind
to
be
killed
to
turn
and
fight
till
escape
was
blocked
his
one
thought
was
to
leave
pursuit
behind
weeks
of
flight
had
sharpened
dyke
every
sense
as
he
turned
into
the
upper
road
beyond
guadalajara
he
saw
the
three
men
galloping
down
from
derrick
stock
range
making
for
the
road
ahead
of
him
they
would
cut
him
off
there
he
swung
the
buckskin
about
he
must
take
the
lower
road
across
los
muertos
from
guadalajara
and
he
must
reach
it
before
delaney
dogs
and
posse
back
he
galloped
the
buckskin
measuring
her
length
with
every
leap
once
more
the
station
came
in
sight
rising
in
his
stirrups
he
looked
across
the
fields
in
the
direction
of
the
lower
road
there
was
a
cloud
of
dust
there
from
a
wagon
no
horses
on
the
run
and
their
riders
were
armed
he
could
catch
the
flash
of
gun
barrels
they
were
all
closing
in
on
him
converging
on
guadalajara
by
every
available
road
the
upper
road
west
of
guadalajara
led
straight
to
bonneville
that
way
was
impossible
was
he
in
a
trap
had
the
time
for
fighting
come
at
last
but
as
dyke
neared
the
depot
at
guadalajara
his
eye
fell
upon
the
detached
locomotive
that
lay
quietly
steaming
on
the
up
line
and
with
a
thrill
of
exultation
he
remembered
that
he
was
an
engineer
born
and
bred
delaney
dogs
were
already
to
be
heard
and
the
roll
of
hoofs
on
the
lower
road
was
dinning
in
his
ears
as
he
leaped
from
the
buckskin
before
the
depot
the
train
crew
scattered
like
frightened
sheep
before
him
but
dyke
ignored
them
his
pistol
was
in
his
hand
as
once
more
on
foot
he
sprang
toward
the
lone
engine
out
of
the
cab
he
shouted
both
of
you
quick
or
i
kill
you
the
two
men
tumbled
from
the
iron
apron
of
the
tender
as
dyke
swung
himself
up
dropping
his
pistol
on
the
floor
of
the
cab
and
reaching
with
the
old
instinct
for
the
familiar
levers
the
great
compound
hissed
and
trembled
as
the
steam
was
released
and
the
huge
drivers
stirred
turning
slowly
on
the
tracks
but
there
was
a
shout
delaney
posse
dogs
and
men
swung
into
view
at
the
turn
of
the
road
their
figures
leaning
over
as
they
took
the
curve
at
full
speed
dyke
threw
everything
wide
open
and
caught
up
his
revolver
from
behind
came
the
challenge
of
a
winchester
the
party
on
the
lower
road
were
even
closer
than
delaney
they
had
seen
his
manoeuvre
and
the
first
shot
of
the
fight
shivered
the
cab
windows
above
the
engineer
head
but
spinning
futilely
at
first
the
drivers
of
the
engine
at
last
caught
the
rails
the
engine
moved
advanced
travelled
past
the
depot
and
the
freight
train
and
gathering
speed
rolled
out
on
the
track
beyond
smoke
black
and
boiling
shot
skyward
from
the
stack
not
a
joint
that
did
not
shudder
with
the
mighty
strain
of
the
steam
but
the
great
iron
brute
one
of
baldwin
newest
and
best
came
to
call
obedient
and
docile
as
soon
as
ever
the
great
pulsing
heart
of
it
felt
a
master
hand
upon
its
levers
it
gathered
its
speed
bracing
its
steel
muscles
its
thews
of
iron
and
roared
out
upon
the
open
track
filling
the
air
with
the
rasp
of
its
blotting
the
sunshine
with
the
belch
of
its
hot
thick
smoke
already
it
was
lessening
in
the
distance
when
delaney
christian
and
the
sheriff
of
visalia
dashed
up
to
the
station
the
posse
had
seen
everything
stuck
curse
the
luck
vociferated
the
but
the
sheriff
was
already
out
of
the
saddle
and
into
the
telegraph
office
there
a
derailing
switch
between
here
and
pixley
is
there
he
cried
wire
ahead
to
open
it
we
derail
him
there
come
on
he
turned
to
delaney
and
the
others
they
sprang
into
the
cab
of
the
locomotive
that
was
attached
to
the
freight
train
name
of
the
state
of
california
shouted
the
sheriff
to
the
bewildered
engineer
cut
off
from
your
the
sheriff
was
a
man
to
be
obeyed
without
hesitating
time
was
not
allowed
the
crew
of
the
freight
train
for
debating
as
to
the
right
or
the
wrong
of
requisitioning
the
engine
and
before
anyone
thought
of
the
safety
or
danger
of
the
affair
the
freight
engine
was
already
flying
out
upon
the
down
line
hot
in
pursuit
of
dyke
now
far
ahead
upon
the
up
track
i
remember
perfectly
well
there
a
derailing
switch
between
here
and
pixley
shouted
the
sheriff
above
the
roar
of
the
locomotive
they
use
it
in
case
they
have
to
derail
runaway
engines
it
runs
right
off
into
the
country
we
pile
him
up
there
ready
with
your
guns
if
we
should
meet
another
train
coming
up
on
this
track
protested
the
frightened
engineer
then
we
jump
or
be
smashed
hi
look
there
he
as
the
freight
engine
rounded
a
curve
dyke
engine
came
into
view
shooting
on
some
quarter
of
a
mile
ahead
of
them
wreathed
in
whirling
smoke
the
switch
ai
much
further
on
clamoured
the
engineer
you
can
see
pixley
dyke
his
hand
on
the
grip
of
the
valve
that
controlled
the
steam
his
head
out
of
the
cab
window
thundered
on
he
was
back
in
his
old
place
again
once
more
he
was
the
engineer
once
more
he
felt
the
engine
quiver
under
him
the
familiar
noises
were
in
his
ears
the
familiar
buffeting
of
the
wind
surged
roaring
at
his
face
the
familiar
odours
of
hot
steam
and
smoke
reeked
in
his
nostrils
and
on
either
side
of
him
parallel
panoramas
the
two
halves
of
the
landscape
sliced
as
it
were
in
two
by
the
clashing
wheels
of
his
engine
streamed
by
in
green
and
brown
blurs
he
found
himself
settling
to
the
old
position
on
the
cab
seat
leaning
on
his
elbow
from
the
window
one
hand
on
the
controller
all
at
once
the
instinct
of
the
pursuit
that
of
late
had
become
so
strong
within
him
prompted
him
to
shoot
a
glance
behind
he
saw
the
other
engine
on
the
down
line
plunging
after
him
rocking
from
side
to
side
with
the
fury
of
its
gallop
not
yet
had
he
shaken
the
trackers
from
his
heels
not
yet
was
he
out
of
the
reach
of
danger
he
set
his
teeth
and
throwing
open
the
stoked
vigorously
for
a
few
moments
the
indicator
of
the
steam
gauge
rose
his
speed
increased
a
glance
at
the
telegraph
poles
told
him
he
was
doing
his
fifty
miles
an
hour
the
freight
engine
behind
him
was
never
built
for
that
pace
barring
the
terrible
risk
of
accident
his
chances
were
good
but
suddenly
the
engineer
dominating
the
he
shut
off
his
steam
and
threw
back
his
brake
to
the
extreme
notch
directly
ahead
of
him
rose
a
semaphore
placed
at
a
point
where
evidently
a
derailing
switch
branched
from
the
line
the
semaphore
arm
was
dropped
over
the
track
setting
the
danger
signal
that
showed
the
switch
was
open
in
an
instant
dyke
saw
the
trick
they
had
meant
to
smash
him
here
had
been
clever
enough
enough
to
open
the
switch
but
had
forgotten
the
automatic
semaphore
that
worked
simultaneously
with
the
movement
of
the
rails
to
go
forward
was
certain
destruction
dyke
reversed
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
back
with
a
wrench
and
a
spasm
of
all
its
metal
fibres
the
great
compound
braced
itself
sliding
with
rigid
wheels
along
the
rails
then
as
dyke
applied
the
reverse
it
drew
back
from
the
greater
danger
returning
towards
the
less
inevitably
now
the
two
engines
one
on
the
up
the
other
on
the
down
line
must
meet
and
pass
each
other
dyke
released
the
levers
reaching
for
his
revolver
the
engineer
once
more
became
the
highwayman
in
peril
of
his
life
now
beyond
all
doubt
the
time
for
fighting
was
at
hand
the
party
in
the
heavy
freight
engine
that
lumbered
after
in
pursuit
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
smudge
of
smoke
on
ahead
that
marked
the
path
of
the
fugitive
suddenly
raised
a
shout
he
stopped
he
broke
down
watch
now
and
see
if
he
jumps
broke
nothing
he
coming
back
ready
now
he
got
to
pass
the
engineer
applied
the
brakes
but
the
heavy
freight
locomotive
far
less
mobile
than
dyke
flyer
was
slow
to
obey
the
smudge
on
the
rails
ahead
grew
swiftly
larger
he
coming
he
coming
look
out
there
a
shot
he
shooting
a
bright
white
sliver
of
wood
leaped
into
the
air
from
the
sooty
window
sill
of
the
cab
fire
on
him
fire
on
him
while
the
engines
were
yet
two
hundred
yards
apart
the
duel
began
shot
answering
shot
the
sharp
staccato
reports
punctuating
the
thunder
of
wheels
and
the
clamour
of
steam
then
the
ground
trembled
and
rocked
a
roar
as
of
heavy
ordnance
developed
with
the
abruptness
of
an
explosion
the
two
engines
passed
each
other
the
men
firing
the
while
emptying
their
revolvers
shattering
wood
shivering
glass
the
bullets
clanging
against
the
metal
work
as
they
struck
and
struck
and
struck
the
men
leaned
from
the
cabs
towards
each
other
frantic
with
excitement
shouting
curses
the
engines
rocking
the
steam
roaring
confusion
whirling
in
the
scene
like
the
whirl
of
a
witch
dance
the
white
clouds
of
steam
the
black
eddies
from
the
smokestack
the
blue
wreaths
from
the
hot
mouths
of
revolvers
swirling
together
in
a
blinding
maze
of
vapour
spinning
around
them
dazing
them
dizzying
them
while
the
head
rang
with
hideous
clamour
and
the
body
twitched
and
trembled
with
the
leap
and
jar
of
the
tumult
of
machinery
roaring
clamouring
reeking
with
the
smell
of
powder
and
hot
oil
spitting
death
resistless
huge
furious
an
abrupt
vision
of
chaos
faces
peering
through
smoke
hands
gripping
outward
from
sudden
darkness
prehensile
malevolent
terrible
as
thunder
swift
as
lightning
the
two
engines
met
and
passed
he
hit
cried
delaney
i
know
i
hit
him
he
ca
go
far
now
after
him
again
he
wo
dare
go
through
it
was
true
dyke
had
stood
between
cab
and
tender
throughout
all
the
duel
exposed
reckless
thinking
only
of
attack
and
not
of
defence
and
a
bullet
from
one
of
the
pistols
had
grazed
his
hip
how
serious
was
the
wound
he
did
not
know
but
he
had
no
thought
of
giving
up
he
tore
back
through
the
depot
at
guadalajara
in
a
storm
of
bullets
and
clinging
to
the
broken
window
ledge
of
his
cab
was
carried
towards
bonneville
on
over
the
long
trestle
and
broderson
creek
and
through
the
open
country
between
the
two
ranches
of
los
muertos
and
quien
sabe
but
to
go
on
to
bonneville
meant
certain
death
before
as
well
as
behind
him
the
roads
were
now
blocked
once
more
he
thought
of
the
mountains
he
resolved
to
abandon
the
engine
and
make
another
final
attempt
to
get
into
the
shelter
of
the
hills
in
the
northernmost
corner
of
quien
sabe
he
set
his
teeth
he
would
not
give
in
there
was
one
more
fight
left
in
him
yet
now
to
try
the
final
hope
he
slowed
the
engine
down
and
reloading
his
revolver
jumped
from
the
platform
to
the
road
he
looked
about
him
listening
all
around
him
widened
an
ocean
of
wheat
there
was
no
one
in
sight
the
released
engine
alone
unattended
drew
slowly
away
from
him
jolting
ponderously
over
the
rail
joints
as
he
watched
it
go
a
certain
indefinite
sense
of
abandonment
even
in
that
moment
came
over
dyke
his
last
friend
that
also
had
been
his
first
was
leaving
him
he
remembered
that
day
long
ago
when
he
had
opened
the
throttle
of
his
first
machine
it
was
leaving
him
alone
his
last
friend
turning
against
him
slowly
it
was
going
back
towards
bonneville
to
the
shops
of
the
railroad
the
camp
of
the
enemy
that
enemy
that
had
ruined
him
and
wrecked
him
for
the
last
time
in
his
life
he
had
been
the
engineer
now
once
more
he
became
the
highwayman
the
outlaw
against
whom
all
hands
were
raised
the
fugitive
skulking
in
the
mountains
listening
for
the
cry
of
dogs
but
he
would
not
give
in
they
had
not
broken
him
yet
never
while
he
could
fight
would
he
allow
behrman
the
triumph
of
his
capture
he
found
his
wound
was
not
bad
he
plunged
into
the
wheat
on
quien
sabe
making
northward
for
a
division
house
that
rose
with
its
surrounding
trees
out
of
the
wheat
like
an
island
he
reached
it
the
blood
squelching
in
his
shoes
but
the
sight
of
two
men
portuguese
staring
at
him
from
an
angle
of
the
barn
abruptly
roused
him
to
action
he
sprang
forward
with
peremptory
commands
demanding
a
horse
at
guadalajara
delaney
and
the
sheriff
descended
from
the
freight
engine
horses
now
declared
the
sheriff
he
wo
go
into
bonneville
certain
he
leave
the
engine
between
here
and
there
and
strike
off
into
the
country
we
follow
after
him
now
in
the
saddle
soon
as
he
leaves
his
engine
he
on
foot
we
as
good
as
got
him
their
horses
including
even
the
buckskin
mare
that
dyke
had
ridden
were
still
at
the
station
the
party
swung
themselves
up
delaney
exclaiming
here
my
mount
as
he
bestrode
the
buckskin
at
guadalajara
the
two
bloodhounds
were
picked
up
again
urging
the
jaded
horses
to
a
gallop
the
party
set
off
along
the
upper
road
keeping
a
sharp
lookout
to
right
and
left
for
traces
of
abandonment
of
the
engine
three
miles
beyond
the
long
trestle
they
found
behrman
holding
his
saddle
horse
by
the
bridle
and
looking
attentively
at
a
trail
that
had
been
broken
through
the
standing
wheat
on
quien
sabe
the
party
drew
rein
the
engine
passed
me
on
the
tracks
further
up
and
empty
said
behrman
boys
i
think
he
left
her
but
before
anyone
could
answer
the
bloodhounds
gave
tongue
again
as
they
picked
up
the
scent
that
him
cried
behrman
get
on
they
dashed
forward
following
the
hounds
behrman
laboriously
climbed
to
his
saddle
panting
perspiring
mopping
the
roll
of
fat
over
his
coat
collar
and
turned
in
after
them
trotting
along
far
in
the
rear
his
great
stomach
and
tremulous
jowl
shaking
with
the
gait
what
a
day
he
murmured
what
a
dyke
trail
was
fresh
and
was
followed
as
easily
as
if
made
on
snow
in
a
short
time
the
posse
swept
into
the
open
space
around
the
division
house
the
two
portuguese
were
still
there
terribly
excited
yes
yes
dyke
had
been
there
not
half
an
hour
since
had
held
them
up
taken
a
horse
and
galloped
to
the
northeast
towards
the
foothills
at
the
headwaters
of
broderson
creek
on
again
at
full
gallop
through
the
young
wheat
trampling
it
under
the
flying
hoofs
the
hounds
hot
on
the
scent
baying
continually
the
men
on
fresh
mounts
secured
at
the
division
house
bending
forward
in
their
saddles
spurring
relentlessly
behrman
jolted
along
far
in
the
rear
and
even
then
harried
through
an
open
country
where
there
was
no
place
to
hide
it
was
a
matter
of
amazement
how
long
a
chase
the
highwayman
led
them
fences
were
passed
fences
whose
barbed
wire
had
been
slashed
apart
by
the
fugitive
knife
the
ground
rose
under
foot
the
hills
were
at
hand
still
the
pursuit
held
on
the
sun
long
past
the
meridian
began
to
turn
earthward
would
night
come
on
before
they
were
up
with
him
look
look
there
he
is
quick
there
he
goes
high
on
the
bare
slope
of
the
nearest
hill
all
the
posse
looking
in
the
direction
of
delaney
gesture
saw
the
figure
of
a
horseman
emerge
from
an
arroyo
filled
with
chaparral
and
struggle
at
a
labouring
gallop
straight
up
the
slope
suddenly
every
member
of
the
party
shouted
aloud
the
horse
had
fallen
pitching
the
rider
from
the
saddle
the
man
rose
to
his
feet
caught
at
the
bridle
missed
it
and
the
horse
dashed
on
alone
the
man
pausing
for
a
second
looked
around
saw
the
chase
drawing
nearer
then
turning
back
disappeared
in
the
chaparral
delaney
raised
a
great
whoop
we
got
you
into
the
slopes
and
valleys
of
the
hills
dashed
the
band
of
horsemen
the
trail
now
so
fresh
that
it
could
be
easily
discerned
by
all
on
and
on
it
led
them
a
furious
wild
scramble
straight
up
the
slopes
the
minutes
went
by
the
dry
bed
of
a
rivulet
was
passed
then
another
fence
then
a
tangle
of
manzanita
a
meadow
of
wild
oats
full
of
agitated
cattle
then
an
arroyo
thick
with
chaparral
and
scrub
oaks
and
then
without
warning
the
pistol
shots
ripped
out
and
ran
from
rider
to
rider
with
the
rapidity
of
a
gatling
discharge
and
one
of
the
deputies
bent
forward
in
the
saddle
both
hands
to
his
face
the
blood
jetting
from
between
his
fingers
dyke
was
there
at
bay
at
last
his
back
against
a
bank
of
rock
the
roots
of
a
fallen
tree
serving
him
as
a
rampart
his
revolver
smoking
in
his
hand
you
under
arrest
dyke
cried
the
sheriff
it
not
the
least
use
to
fight
the
whole
country
is
dyke
fired
again
the
shot
splintering
the
foreleg
of
the
horse
the
sheriff
rode
the
posse
four
men
all
told
the
wounded
deputy
having
crawled
out
of
the
fight
after
dyke
first
shot
fell
back
after
the
preliminary
fusillade
dismounted
and
took
shelter
behind
rocks
and
trees
on
that
rugged
ground
fighting
from
the
saddle
was
impracticable
dyke
in
the
meanwhile
held
his
fire
for
he
knew
that
once
his
pistol
was
empty
he
would
never
be
allowed
time
to
reload
dyke
called
the
sheriff
again
for
the
last
time
i
summon
you
to
dyke
did
not
reply
the
sheriff
delaney
and
the
man
named
christian
conferred
together
in
a
low
voice
then
delaney
and
christian
left
the
others
making
a
wide
detour
up
the
sides
of
the
arroyo
to
gain
a
position
to
the
left
and
somewhat
to
the
rear
of
dyke
but
it
was
at
this
moment
that
behrman
arrived
it
could
not
be
said
whether
it
was
courage
or
carelessness
that
brought
the
railroad
agent
within
reach
of
dyke
revolver
possibly
he
was
really
a
brave
man
possibly
occupied
with
keeping
an
uncertain
seat
upon
the
back
of
his
labouring
scrambling
horse
he
had
not
noticed
that
he
was
so
close
upon
that
scene
of
battle
he
certainly
did
not
observe
the
posse
lying
upon
the
ground
behind
sheltering
rocks
and
trees
and
before
anyone
could
call
a
warning
he
had
ridden
out
into
the
open
within
thirty
paces
of
dyke
intrenchment
dyke
saw
there
was
the
the
man
of
all
men
whom
he
most
hated
the
man
who
had
ruined
him
who
had
exasperated
him
and
driven
him
to
crime
and
who
had
instigated
tireless
pursuit
through
all
those
past
terrible
weeks
suddenly
inviting
death
he
leaped
up
and
forward
he
had
forgotten
all
else
all
other
considerations
at
the
sight
of
this
man
he
would
die
gladly
so
only
that
behrman
died
before
him
i
got
you
anyway
he
shouted
as
he
ran
forward
the
muzzle
of
the
weapon
was
not
ten
feet
from
behrman
huge
stomach
as
dyke
drew
the
trigger
had
the
cartridge
exploded
death
certain
and
swift
would
have
followed
but
at
this
of
all
moments
the
revolver
missed
fire
behrman
with
an
unexpected
agility
leaped
from
the
saddle
and
keeping
his
horse
between
him
and
dyke
ran
dodging
and
ducking
from
tree
to
tree
his
first
shot
a
failure
dyke
fired
again
and
again
at
his
enemy
emptying
his
revolver
reckless
of
consequences
his
every
shot
went
wild
and
before
he
could
draw
his
knife
the
whole
posse
was
upon
him
without
concerted
plans
obeying
no
signal
but
the
promptings
of
the
impulse
that
snatched
unerring
at
opportunity
the
men
delaney
and
christian
from
one
side
the
sheriff
and
the
deputy
from
the
other
rushed
in
they
did
not
fire
it
was
dyke
alive
they
wanted
one
of
them
had
a
riata
snatched
from
a
and
with
this
they
tried
to
bind
him
the
fight
was
four
to
one
four
men
with
law
on
their
side
to
one
wounded
freebooter
exhausted
by
days
and
nights
of
pursuit
worn
down
with
loss
of
sleep
thirst
privation
and
the
grinding
consciousness
of
an
peril
they
swarmed
upon
him
from
all
sides
gripping
at
his
legs
at
his
arms
his
throat
his
head
striking
clutching
kicking
falling
to
the
ground
rolling
over
and
over
now
under
now
above
now
staggering
forward
now
toppling
back
still
dyke
fought
through
that
scrambling
struggling
group
through
that
maze
of
twisting
bodies
twining
arms
straining
legs
behrman
saw
him
from
moment
to
moment
his
face
flaming
his
eyes
bloodshot
his
hair
matted
with
sweat
now
he
was
down
pinned
under
two
men
across
his
legs
and
now
up
again
struggling
to
one
knee
then
upright
again
with
half
his
enemies
hanging
on
his
back
his
colossal
strength
seemed
doubled
when
his
arms
were
held
he
fought
with
his
head
a
score
of
times
it
seemed
as
if
they
were
about
to
secure
him
finally
and
irrevocably
and
then
he
would
free
an
arm
a
leg
a
shoulder
and
the
group
that
for
the
fraction
of
an
instant
had
settled
locked
and
rigid
on
its
prey
would
break
up
again
as
he
flung
a
man
from
him
reeling
and
bloody
and
he
himself
twisting
squirming
dodging
his
great
fists
working
like
pistons
backed
away
dragging
and
carrying
the
others
with
him
more
than
once
he
loosened
almost
every
grip
and
for
an
instant
stood
nearly
free
panting
rolling
his
eyes
his
clothes
torn
from
his
body
bleeding
dripping
with
sweat
a
terrible
figure
nearly
free
the
sheriff
under
his
breath
uttered
an
exclamation
by
god
he
get
away
behrman
watched
the
fight
complacently
that
all
may
show
obstinacy
he
commented
but
it
do
show
common
yet
however
dyke
might
throw
off
the
clutches
and
fettering
embraces
that
encircled
him
however
he
might
disintegrate
and
scatter
the
band
of
foes
that
heaped
themselves
upon
him
however
he
might
gain
one
instant
of
comparative
liberty
some
one
of
his
assailants
always
hung
doggedly
blindly
to
an
arm
a
leg
or
a
foot
and
the
others
drawing
a
second
breath
closed
in
again
implacable
unconquerable
ferocious
like
hounds
upon
a
wolf
at
length
two
of
the
men
managed
to
bring
dyke
wrists
close
enough
together
to
allow
the
sheriff
to
snap
the
handcuffs
on
even
then
dyke
clasping
his
hands
and
using
the
handcuffs
themselves
as
a
weapon
knocked
down
delaney
by
the
crushing
impact
of
the
steel
bracelets
upon
the
forehead
but
he
could
no
longer
protect
himself
from
attacks
from
behind
and
the
riata
was
finally
passed
around
his
body
pinioning
his
arms
to
his
sides
after
this
it
was
useless
to
resist
the
wounded
deputy
sat
with
his
back
to
a
rock
holding
his
broken
jaw
in
both
hands
the
sheriff
horse
with
its
splintered
foreleg
would
have
to
be
shot
delaney
head
was
cut
from
temple
to
cheekbone
the
right
wrist
of
the
sheriff
was
all
but
dislocated
the
other
deputy
was
so
exhausted
he
had
to
be
helped
to
his
horse
but
dyke
was
taken
he
himself
had
suddenly
lapsed
into
unable
to
walk
they
sat
him
on
the
buckskin
behrman
supporting
him
the
sheriff
on
foot
leading
the
horse
by
the
bridle
the
little
procession
formed
and
descended
from
the
hills
turning
in
the
direction
of
bonneville
a
special
train
one
car
and
an
engine
would
be
made
up
there
and
the
highwayman
would
sleep
in
the
visalia
jail
that
night
delaney
and
behrman
found
themselves
in
the
rear
of
the
cavalcade
as
it
moved
off
the
turned
to
his
chief
well
captain
he
said
still
panting
as
he
bound
up
his
forehead
well
we
got
chapter
vi
osterman
cut
his
wheat
that
summer
before
any
of
the
other
ranchers
and
as
soon
as
his
harvest
was
over
organized
a
drive
like
annixter
it
was
to
be
an
event
in
which
all
the
should
take
part
the
drive
was
to
begin
on
the
most
western
division
of
the
osterman
ranch
whence
it
would
proceed
towards
the
southeast
crossing
into
the
northern
part
of
quien
sabe
on
which
annixter
had
sown
no
wheat
and
ending
in
the
hills
at
the
headwaters
of
broderson
creek
where
a
barbecue
was
to
be
held
early
on
the
morning
of
the
day
of
the
drive
as
harran
and
presley
were
saddling
their
horses
before
the
stables
on
los
muertos
the
foreman
phelps
remarked
i
was
into
town
last
night
and
i
hear
that
christian
has
been
after
ruggles
early
and
late
to
have
him
put
him
in
possession
here
on
los
muertos
and
delaney
is
doing
the
same
for
quien
it
was
this
man
christian
the
real
estate
broker
and
cousin
of
behrman
one
of
the
main
actors
in
the
drama
of
dyke
capture
who
had
come
forward
as
a
purchaser
of
los
muertos
when
the
railroad
had
regraded
its
holdings
on
the
ranches
around
bonneville
he
claims
of
course
phelps
went
on
that
when
he
bought
los
muertos
of
the
railroad
he
was
guaranteed
possession
and
he
wants
the
place
in
time
for
the
that
almost
as
thin
muttered
harran
as
he
thrust
the
bit
into
his
horse
mouth
as
delaney
buying
annixter
home
ranch
that
slice
of
quien
sabe
according
to
the
railroad
grading
is
worth
about
ten
thousand
dollars
yes
even
fifteen
and
i
do
believe
delaney
is
worth
the
price
of
a
good
horse
why
those
people
do
even
try
to
preserve
appearances
where
would
christian
find
the
money
to
buy
los
muertos
there
no
one
man
in
all
bonneville
rich
enough
to
do
it
damned
rascals
as
if
we
did
see
that
christian
and
delaney
are
behrman
right
and
left
hands
well
he
get
cut
off
he
cried
with
sudden
fierceness
if
he
comes
too
near
the
how
is
it
harran
asked
presley
as
the
two
young
men
rode
out
of
the
stable
yard
how
is
it
the
railroad
gang
can
do
anything
before
the
supreme
court
hands
down
a
decision
well
you
know
how
they
talk
growled
harran
they
have
claimed
that
the
cases
taken
up
to
the
supreme
court
were
not
test
cases
as
we
claim
they
are
and
that
because
neither
annixter
nor
the
governor
appealed
they
lost
their
cases
by
default
it
the
rottenest
kind
of
sharp
practice
but
it
wo
do
any
good
the
league
is
too
strong
they
dare
move
on
us
yet
awhile
why
pres
the
moment
they
try
to
jump
any
of
these
ranches
around
here
they
would
have
six
hundred
rifles
cracking
at
them
as
quick
as
why
it
would
take
a
regiment
of
soldiers
to
put
any
one
of
us
off
our
land
no
sir
they
know
the
league
means
business
this
as
presley
and
harran
trotted
on
along
the
county
road
they
continually
passed
or
overtook
other
horsemen
or
buggies
or
even
farm
wagons
going
in
the
same
direction
these
were
full
of
the
farming
people
from
all
the
country
round
about
bonneville
on
their
way
to
the
rabbit
drive
the
same
people
seen
at
the
in
their
sunday
finest
the
girls
in
muslin
frocks
and
garden
hats
the
men
with
linen
dusters
over
their
black
clothes
the
older
women
in
prints
and
dotted
calicoes
many
of
these
latter
had
already
taken
off
their
bonnets
the
day
was
very
hot
and
pinning
them
in
newspapers
stowed
them
under
the
seats
they
tucked
their
handkerchiefs
into
the
collars
of
their
dresses
or
knotted
them
about
their
fat
necks
to
keep
out
the
dust
from
the
axle
trees
of
the
vehicles
swung
carefully
covered
buckets
of
galvanised
iron
in
which
the
lunch
was
packed
the
younger
children
the
boys
with
great
frilled
collars
the
girls
with
shoes
cramping
their
feet
leaned
from
the
sides
of
buggy
and
eating
bananas
and
macaroons
staring
about
with
stolidity
tied
to
the
axles
the
dogs
followed
the
hoofs
with
lolling
tongues
coated
with
dust
the
california
summer
lay
and
smothering
over
all
the
land
the
hills
were
browned
and
parched
the
grasses
and
sear
and
yellow
snapped
like
glass
filaments
under
foot
the
roads
the
bordering
fences
even
the
lower
leaves
and
branches
of
the
trees
were
thick
and
grey
with
dust
all
colour
had
been
burned
from
the
landscape
except
in
the
irrigated
patches
that
in
the
waste
of
brown
and
dull
yellow
glowed
like
oases
the
wheat
now
close
to
its
maturity
had
turned
from
pale
yellow
to
golden
yellow
and
from
that
to
brown
like
a
gigantic
carpet
it
spread
itself
over
all
the
land
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
seen
but
the
limitless
sea
of
wheat
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
dry
rustling
crisp
and
harsh
in
the
rare
breaths
of
hot
wind
out
of
the
southeast
as
harran
and
presley
went
along
the
county
road
the
number
of
vehicles
and
riders
increased
they
overtook
and
passed
hooven
and
his
family
in
the
former
farm
wagon
a
saddled
horse
tied
to
the
back
board
the
little
dutchman
wearing
the
old
frock
coat
of
magnus
derrick
and
a
new
straw
hat
sat
on
the
front
seat
with

the
little

the
older
daughter
minna
were
behind

on
a

across

as
the
two
friends
rode
on
presley
had
in
his
mind
the
image
of
minna
hooven
very
pretty
in
a
clean
gown
of
pink
gingham
a
cheap
straw
sailor
hat
from
a
bonneville
store
on
her
blue
black
hair
he
remembered
her
very
pale
face
very
red
lips
and
eyes
of
greenish
blue
a
pretty
girl
certainly
always
trailing
a
group
of
men
behind
her
her
love
affairs
were
the
talk
of
all
los

i

hooven

to

answered
there
nothing
vicious
about
minna
and
i

she

that
foreman
on
the
ditch
gang
right
well
as
a
matter
of
course
she
a
good
girl
presley
hastened
to
reply
only
she
too
pretty
for
a
poor
girl
and
too
sure
of
her
prettiness
besides
that
the
kind
he
continued
who
would
find
it
pretty
easy
to
go
wrong
if
they
lived
in
a
around
caraher

a
veritable
throng
saddle
horses
and

by
the

three
of
broderson

and

from

on

already
very
drunk
continually
young
men
singly
or
in
groups
came
from
the
wiping
their
lips
with
sidelong
gestures
of
the
hand
the
whole
place
exhaled
the
febrile
bustle
of
the
saloon
on
a
holiday
morning
the
procession
of
teams
streamed
on
through
bonneville
reenforced
at

down

waving
his

the

came
to
a
halt
the

pointing

the

perspiring

galloping
about

ranged
the

of

in

over

the

at

nearly
five
thousand
people
were
present
the

of

no

the

motionless
under

jokes
fooled
some
one
in
the
line
an
old
man
or
some
old
woman
nervous
hard
of
hearing
always
gathered
up
the
reins
and
started
off
only
to
be
hustled
and
ordered
back
into
the
line
by
the
nearest
marshal
this
manoeuvre
never
failed
to
produce
its
effect
of
hilarity
upon
those
near
at
hand
everybody
laughed
at
the
blunderer
the
joker
jeering
audibly
hey
come
back
oh
he
do
be
in
a
hurry
say
you
want
to
drive
all
the
rabbits
later
on
a
certain
group
of
these
fellows
started
a
huge
say
that

oh

cried
some
women
in
a
covered
rig
see
they
are
starting
already
over
in
fact
it
did
appear
as
if
the
far
extremity
of
the
line
was
in
motion
dust
rose
in
the
air
above
it
they
are
starting
why
do
we
start
no
they
stopped
false
they
not
either
why
do
we
move
but
as
one
or
two
began
to
move
off
the
nearest
marshal
shouted
wrathfully

well
they
started
over
get

i
tell
where
the
say
we
going
to
miss
it
all
they
all
started
over
a
lieutenant
came
galloping
along
in
front
of
the
line
shouting
here
what
the
matter
here
why
do
you
start
there
was
a
great
shout
everybody
simultaneously
uttered
a
prolonged
we
here
we
go
for
sure
this
remember
to
keep
the
alignment
roared
the
lieutenant
do
go
too
and
the
marshals
rushing
here
and
there
on
their
sweating
horses
to
points
where
the
line
bulged
forward
shouted
waving
their
arms
not
too
fast
not
too
fast
back
here
keep
closer
together
here
do
you
want
to
let
all
the
rabbits
run
back
between
you
a
great
confused
sound
rose
into
the
air
the
creaking
of
axles
the
jolt
of
iron
tires
over
the
dry
clods
the
click
of
brittle
stubble
under
the
horses
hoofs
the
barking
of
dogs
the
shouts
of
conversation
and
laughter
the
entire
line
horses
buggies
wagons
gigs
dogs
men
and
boys
on
foot
and
armed
with
clubs
moved
slowly
across
the
fields
sending
up
a
cloud
of
white
dust
that
hung
above
the
scene
like
smoke
a
brisk
gaiety
was
in
the
air
everyone
was
in
the
best
of
humor
calling
from
team
to
team
laughing
skylarking
joshing
garnett
of
the
ruby
rancho
and
gethings
of
the
san
pablo
both
on
horseback
found
themselves
side
by
side
ignoring
the
drive
and
the
spirit
of
the
occasion
they
kept
up
a
prolonged
and
serious
conversation
on
an
expected
rise
in
the
price
of
wheat
dabney
also
on
horseback
followed
them
listening
attentively
to
every
word
but
hazarding
no
remark
derrick
and
hilma
sat
in
the
back
seat
of
the
behind
young
vacca
derrick
a
little
disturbed
by
such
a
great
concourse
of
people
frightened
at
the
idea
of
the
killing
of
so
many
rabbits
drew
back
in
her
place
her
eyes
troubled
and
filled
with
a
vague
distress
hilma
very
much
excited
leaned
from
the
anxious
to
see
everything
watching
for
rabbits
asking
innumerable
questions
of
annixter
who
rode
at
her
side
the
change
that
had
been
progressing
in
hilma
ever
since
the
night
of
the
famous
now
seemed
to
be
approaching
its
climax
first
the
girl
then
the
woman
last
of
all
the
mother
conscious
dignity
a
new
element
in
her
character
developed
the
shrinking
the
timidity
of
the
girl
just
awakening
to
the
consciousness
of
sex
passed
away
from
her
the
confusion
the
troublous
complexity
of
the
woman
a
mystery
even
to
herself
disappeared
motherhood
dawned
the
old
simplicity
of
her
maiden
days
came
back
to
her
it
was
no
longer
a
simplicity
of
ignorance
but
of
supreme
knowledge
the
simplicity
of
the
perfect
the
simplicity
of
greatness
she
looked
the
world
fearlessly
in
the
eyes
at
last
the
confusion
of
her
ideas
like
frightened
birds
adjusted
itself
and
she
emerged
from
the
trouble
calm
serene
entering
into
her
divine
right
like
a
queen
into
the
rule
of
a
realm
of
perpetual
peace
and
with
this
with
the
knowledge
that
the
crown
hung
poised
above
her
head
there
came
upon
hilma
a
gentleness
infinitely
beautiful
infinitely
pathetic
a
sweetness
that
touched
all
who
came
near
her
with
the
softness
of
a
caress
she
moved
surrounded
by
an
invisible
atmosphere
of
love
love
was
in
her
brown
eyes
love
the
dim
reflection
of
that
descending
crown
poised
over
her
head
radiated
in
a
faint
lustre
from
her
dark
thick
hair
around
her
beautiful
neck
sloping
to
her
shoulders
with
full
graceful
curves
love
lay
encircled
like
a
necklace
love
that
was
beyond
words
sweet
breathed
from
her
parted
lips
from
her
white
large
arms
downward
to
her
pink
love
an
invisible
electric
fluid
disengaged
itself
subtle
alluring
in
the
velvety
huskiness
of
her
voice
love
vibrated
like
a
note
of
unknown
music
annixter
her
uncouth
rugged
husband
living
in
this
influence
of
a
wife
who
was
also
a
mother
at
all
hours
touched
to
the
quick
by
this
sense
of
nobility
of
gentleness
and
of
love
the
instincts
of
a
father
already
clutching
and
tugging
at
his
heart
was
trembling
on
the
verge
of
a
mighty
transformation
the
hardness
and
inhumanity
of
the
man
was
fast
breaking
up
one
night
returning
late
to
the
ranch
house
after
a
compulsory
visit
to
the
city
he
had
come
upon
hilma
asleep
he
had
never
forgotten
that
night
a
realization
of
his
boundless
happiness
in
this
love
he
gave
and
received
the
thought
that
hilma
trusted
him
a
knowledge
of
his
own
unworthiness
a
vast
and
humble
thankfulness
that
his
god
had
chosen
him
of
all
men
for
this
great
joy
had
brought
him
to
his
knees
for
the
first
time
in
all
his
troubled
restless
life
of
combat
and
aggression
he
prayed
he
knew
not
what
vague
words
wordless
thoughts
resolving
fiercely
to
do
right
to
make
some
return
for
god
gift
thus
placed
within
his
hands
where
once
annixter
had
thought
only
of
himself
he
now
thought
only
of
hilma
the
time
when
this
thought
of
another
should
broaden
and
widen
into
thought
of
others
was
yet
to
come
but
already
it
had
expanded
to
include
the
unborn
child
already
as
in
the
case
of
dyke
it
had
broadened
to
enfold
another
child
and
another
mother
bound
to
him
by
no
ties
other
than
those
of
humanity
and
pity
in
time
starting
from
this
point
it
would
reach
out
more
and
more
till
it
should
take
in
all
men
and
all
women
and
the
intolerant
selfish
man
while
retaining
all
of
his
native
strength
should
become
tolerant
and
generous
kind
and
forgiving
for
the
moment
however
the
two
natures
struggled
within
him
a
fight
was
to
be
fought
one
more
the
last
the
fiercest
the
attack
of
the
enemy
who
menaced
his
very
home
and
hearth
was
to
be
resisted
then
peace
attained
arrested
development
would
once
more
proceed
hilma
looked
from
the
scanning
the
open
plain
in
front
of
the
advancing
line
of
the
drive
where
are
the
rabbits
she
asked
of
annixter
i
do
see
any
at
they
are
way
ahead
of
us
yet
he
said
here
take
the
he
passed
her
his
field
glasses
and
she
adjusted
them
oh
yes
she
cried
i
see
i
can
see
five
or
six
but
oh
so
far
the
beggars
run
ahead
at
i
should
say
so
see
them
run
little
specks
every
now
and
then
they
sit
up
their
ears
straight
up
in
the
here
look
hilma
there
goes
one
close
from
out
of
the
ground
apparently
some
twenty
yards
distant
a
great
jack
sprang
into
view
bounding
away
with
tremendous
leaps
his
ears
erect
he
disappeared
his
grey
body
losing
itself
against
the
grey
of
the
ground
oh
a
big
hi
yonder
yes
yes
oh
look
at
him
from
off
the
surface
of
the
ground
at
first
apparently
empty
of
all
life
and
seemingly
unable
to
afford
hiding
place
for
so
much
as
a
started
up
at
every
moment
as
the
line
went
forward
at
first
they
appeared
singly
and
at
long
intervals
then
in
twos
and
threes
as
the
drive
continued
to
advance
they
leaped
across
the
plain
and
stopped
in
the
distance
sitting
up
with
straight
ears
then
ran
on
again
were
joined
by
others
sank
down
flush
to
the
soil
their
ears
flattened
started
up
again
ran
to
the
side
turned
back
once
more
darted
away
with
incredible
swiftness
and
were
lost
to
view
only
to
be
replaced
by
a
score
of
others
gradually
the
number
of
jacks
to
be
seen
over
the
expanse
of
stubble
in
front
of
the
line
of
teams
increased
their
antics
were
infinite
no
two
acted
precisely
alike
some
lay
stubbornly
close
in
a
little
depression
between
two
clods
till
the
horses
hoofs
were
all
but
upon
them
then
sprang
out
from
their
at
the
last
second
others
ran
forward
but
a
few
yards
at
a
time
refusing
to
take
flight
scenting
a
greater
danger
before
them
than
behind
still
others
forced
up
at
the
last
moment
doubled
with
lightning
alacrity
in
their
tracks
turning
back
to
scuttle
between
the
teams
taking
desperate
chances
as
often
as
this
occurred
it
was
the
signal
for
a
great
uproar
do
let
him
get
through
don
t
let
him
get
look
out
for
him
there
he
horns
were
blown
bells
rung
tin
pans
clamorously
beaten
either
the
jack
escaped
or
confused
by
the
noise
darted
back
again
fleeing
away
as
if
his
life
depended
on
the
issue
of
the
instant
once
even
a
bewildered
rabbit
jumped
fair
into
derrick
lap
as
she
sat
in
the
and
was
out
again
like
a
flash
poor
frightened
thing
she
exclaimed
and
for
a
long
time
afterward
she
retained
upon
her
knees
the
sensation
of
the
four
little
paws
quivering
with
excitement
and
the
feel
of
the
trembling
furry
body
with
its
wildly
beating
heart
pressed
against
her
own
by
noon
the
number
of
rabbits
discernible
by
annixter
field
glasses
on
ahead
was
far
into
the
thousands
what
seemed
to
be
ground
resolved
itself
when
seen
through
the
glasses
into
a
maze
of
small
moving
bodies
leaping
ducking
doubling
running
back
and
forth
a
wilderness
of
agitated
ears
white
tails
and
twinkling
legs
the
outside
wings
of
the
curved
line
of
vehicles
began
to
draw
in
a
little
osterman
ranch
was
left
behind
the
drive
continued
on
over
quien
sabe
as
the
day
advanced
the
rabbits
singularly
enough
became
less
wild
when
flushed
they
no
longer
ran
so
far
nor
so
fast
limping
off
instead
a
few
feet
at
a
time
and
crouching
down
their
ears
close
upon
their
backs
thus
it
was
that
by
degrees
the
teams
began
to
close
up
on
the
main
herd
at
every
instant
the
numbers
increased
it
was
no
longer
thousands
it
was
tens
of
thousands
the
earth
was
alive
with
rabbits
denser
and
denser
grew
the
throng
in
all
directions
nothing
was
to
be
seen
but
the
loose
mass
of
the
moving
jacks
the
horns
of
the
crescent
of
teams
began
to
contract
far
off
the
corral
came
into
sight
the
disintegrated
mass
of
rabbits
commenced
as
it
were
to
solidify
to
coagulate
at
first
each
jack
was
some
three
feet
distant
from
his
nearest
neighbor
but
this
space
diminished
to
two
feet
then
to
one
then
to
but
a
few
inches
the
rabbits
began
leaping
over
one
another
then
the
strange
scene
defined
itself
it
was
no
longer
a
herd
covering
the
earth
it
was
a
sea
whipped
into
confusion
tossing
incessantly
leaping
falling
agitated
by
unseen
forces
at
times
the
unexpected
tameness
of
the
rabbits
all
at
once
vanished
throughout
certain
portions
of
the
herd
eddies
of
terror
abruptly
burst
forth
a
panic
spread
then
there
would
ensue
a
blind
wild
rushing
together
of
thousands
of
crowded
bodies
and
a
furious
scrambling
over
backs
till
the
scuffing
thud
of
innumerable
feet
over
the
earth
rose
to
a
reverberating
murmur
as
of
distant
thunder
here
and
there
pierced
by
the
strange
wild
cry
of
the
rabbit
in
distress
the
line
of
vehicles
was
halted
to
go
forward
now
meant
to
trample
the
rabbits
under
foot
the
drive
came
to
a
standstill
while
the
herd
entered
the
corral
this
took
time
for
the
rabbits
were
by
now
too
crowded
to
run
however
like
an
opened
the
extending
flanks
of
the
entrance
of
the
corral
slowly
engulfed
the
herd
the
mass
packed
tight
as
ever
by
degrees
diminished
precisely
as
a
pool
of
water
when
a
dam
is
opened
the
last
stragglers
went
in
with
a
rush
and
the
gate
was
dropped
come
just
have
a
lock
in
here
called
annixter
hilma
descending
from
the
and
joined
by
presley
and
harran
approached
and
looked
over
the
high
board
fence
oh
did
you
ever
see
anything
like
that
she
exclaimed
the
corral
a
really
large
enclosure
had
proved
all
too
small
for
the
number
of
rabbits
collected
by
the
drive
inside
it
was
a
living
moving
leaping
breathing
twisting
mass
the
rabbits
were
packed
two
three
and
four
feet
deep
they
were
in
constant
movement
those
beneath
struggling
to
the
top
those
on
top
sinking
and
disappearing
below
their
fellows
all
wildness
all
fear
of
man
seemed
to
have
entirely
disappeared
men
and
boys
reaching
over
the
sides
of
the
corral
picked
up
a
jack
in
each
hand
holding
them
by
the
ears
while
two
reporters
from
san
francisco
papers
took
photographs
of
the
scene
the
noise
made
by
the
tens
of
thousands
of
moving
bodies
was
as
the
noise
of
wind
in
a
forest
while
from
the
hot
and
sweating
mass
there
rose
a
strange
odor
penetrating
ammoniacal
savouring
of
wild
life
on
signal
the
killing
began
dogs
that
had
been
brought
there
for
that
purpose
when
let
into
the
corral
refused
as
had
been
half
expected
to
do
the
work
they
snuffed
curiously
at
the
pile
then
backed
off
disturbed
perplexed
but
the
men
and
boys
portuguese
for
the
most
part
were
more
eager
annixter
drew
hilma
away
and
indeed
most
of
the
people
set
about
the
barbecue
at
once
in
the
corral
however
the
killing
went
forward
armed
with
a
club
in
each
hand
the
young
fellows
from
guadalajara
and
bonneville
and
the
farm
boys
from
the
ranches
leaped
over
the
rails
of
the
corral
they
walked
unsteadily
upon
the
myriad
of
crowding
bodies
underfoot
or
as
space
was
cleared
sank
almost
waist
deep
into
the
mass
that
leaped
and
squirmed
about
them
blindly
furiously
they
struck
and
struck
the
spectators
round
about
drew
back
in
disgust
but
the
hot
degenerated
blood
of
portuguese
mexican
and
mixed
spaniard
boiled
up
in
excitement
at
this
wholesale
slaughter
but
only
a
few
of
the
participants
of
the
drive
cared
to
look
on
all
the
guests
betook
themselves
some
quarter
of
a
mile
farther
on
into
the
hills
the
picnic
and
barbecue
were
to
be
held
around
the
spring
where
broderson
creek
took
its
rise
already
two
entire
beeves
were
roasting
there
teams
were
hitched
saddles
removed
and
men
women
and
children
a
great
throng
spread
out
under
the
shade
of
the
live
oaks
a
vast
confused
clamour
rose
in
the
air
a
babel
of
talk
a
clatter
of
tin
plates
of
knives
and
forks
bottles
were
uncorked
napkins
and
spread
over
the
ground
the
men
lit
pipes
and
cigars
the
women
seized
the
occasion
to
nurse
their
babies
osterman
ubiquitous
as
ever
resplendent
in
his
boots
and
english
riding
breeches
moved
about
between
the
groups
keeping
up
an
endless
flow
of
talk
cracking
jokes
winking
nudging
gesturing
putting
his
tongue
in
his

never
at
a

at

right
buck
inquired
osterman
coming
up
to
where
annixter
hilma
and
derrick
were
sitting
down
to
their
lunch
yes
yes
everything
right
but
we
no
no
no
here
you
are
and
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
with
a
attachment
harran
and
presley
came
up
bearing
between
them
a
great
smoking
roasted
portion
of
beef
just
off
the
fire
hilma
hastened
to
put
forward
a
huge
china
platter
osterman
had
a
joke
to
crack
with
the
two
boys
a
joke
that
was
rather
broad
but
as
he
turned
about
the
words
almost
on
his
lips
his
glance
fell
upon
hilma
herself
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
more
than
two
months
she
had
handed
presley
the
platter
and
was
now
sitting
with
her
back
against
the
tree
between
two
boles
of
the
roots
the
position
was
a
little
elevated
and
the
supporting
roots
on
either
side
of
her
were
like
the
arms
of
a
great
chair
a
chair
of
state
she
sat
thus
as
on
a
throne
raised
above
the
rest
the
radiance
of
the
unseen
crown
of
motherhood
glowing
from
her
forehead
the
beauty
of
the
perfect
woman
surrounding
her
like
a
glory
and
the
josh
died
away
on
osterman
lips
and
unconsciously
and
swiftly
he
bared
his
head
something
was
passing
there
in
the
air
about
him
that
he
did
not
understand
something
however
that
imposed
reverence
and
profound
respect
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
embarrassment
seized
upon
him
upon
this
joker
this
wearer
of
clothes
this
teller
of
funny
stories
with
his
large
red
ears
bald
head
and
comic
actor
face
he
stammered
confusedly
and
took
himself
away
for
the
moment
abstracted
serious
lost
in
thought
by
now
everyone
was
eating
it
was
the
feeding
of
the
people
elemental
gross
a
great
appeasing
of
appetite
an
enormous
quenching
of
thirst
quarters
of
beef
roasts
ribs
shoulders
haunches
were
consumed
loaves
of
bread
by
the
thousands
disappeared
whole
barrels
of
wine
went
down
the
dry
and
dusty
throats
of
the
multitude
conversation
lagged
while
the
people
ate
while
hunger
was
appeased
everybody
had
their
fill
one
ate
for
the
sake
of
eating
resolved
that
there
should
be
nothing
left
considering
it
a
matter
of
pride
to
exhibit
a
clean
plate
after
dinner
preparations
were
made
for
games
on
a
flat
plateau
at
the
top
of
one
of
the
hills
the
contestants
were
to
strive
there
was
to
be
a
footrace
of
young
girls
under
seventeen
a
fat
men
race
the
younger
fellows
were
to
put
the
shot
to
compete
in
the
running
broad
jump
and
the
standing
high
jump
in
the
hop
skip
and
step
and
in
wrestling
presley
was
delighted
with
it
all
it
was
homeric
this
feasting
this
vast
consuming
of
meat
and
bread
and
wine
followed
now
by
games
of
strength
an
epic
simplicity
and
directness
an
honest
mirth
and
innocence
commended
it
crude
it
was
coarse
it
was
but
no
taint
of
viciousness
was
here
these
people
were
good
people
kindly
benignant
even
always
readier
to
give
than
to
receive
always
more
willing
to
help
than
to
be
helped
they
were
good
stock
of
such
was
the
backbone
of
the
nation
sturdy
americans
everyone
of
them
where
else
in
the
world
round
were
such
strong
honest
men
such
strong
beautiful
women
annixter
harran
and
presley
climbed
to
the
level
plateau
where
the
games
were
to
be
held
to
lay
out
the
courses
and
mark
the
distances
it
was
the
very
place
where
once
presley
had
loved
to
lounge
entire
afternoons
reading
his
books
of
poems
smoking
and
dozing
from
this
high
point
one
dominated
the
entire
valley
to
the
south
and
west
the
view
was
superb
the
three
men
paused
for
a
moment
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
to
consider
it
young
vacca
came
running
and
panting
up
the
hill
after
them
calling
for
annixter
well
well
what
is
it
mr
osterman
looking
for
you

just
come
from
the
governor
with
a
message
i
guess

hello
what
up
now
muttered
annixter
as
they
turned
back
they
found
osterman
saddling
his
horse
in
furious
haste
him
was
vanamee
holding
by
the
bridle
an
animal
that
was
one
lather
of
sweat
a
few
of
the
picnickers
were
turning
their
heads
curiously
in
that
direction
evidently
something
of
moment
was
in
the
wind
what
all
up
demanded
annixter
as
he
and
harran
followed
by
presley
drew
near
there
hell
to
pay
exclaimed
osterman
under
his
breath
read
that
vanamee
just
brought
he
handed
annixter
a
sheet
of
note
paper
and
turned
again
to
the
cinching
of
his
saddle

she
said
never
a
word
she
looked
once
long
into
his
eyes
then
kissed
him
on
the
mouth
meanwhile
the
news
had
spread
the
multitude
rose
to
its
feet
women
and
men
with
pale
faces
looked
at
each
other
speechless
or
broke
forth
into
inarticulate
exclamations
a
strange
unfamiliar
murmur
took
the
place
of
the
tumultuous
gaiety
of
the
previous
moments
a
sense
of
dread
of
confusion
of
impending
terror
weighed
heavily
in
the
air
what
was
now
to
happen
when
annixter
got
back
to
osterman
he
found
a
number
of
the
leaguers
already
assembled
they
were
all
mounted
hooven
was
there
and
harran
and
besides
these
garnett
of
the
ruby
ranch
and
gethings
of
the
san
pablo
phelps
the
foreman
of
los

and
last
of
all
dabney
silent
as
ever
speaking
to
no
one
presley

keep
out
of
this
pres
cried
annixter

exclaimed
gethings
ready

of
us
cried
annixter
where
are
the
six
hundred
men
who
were
going
to
rise
when
this
happened
they
had
wavered
these
other
leaguers
now
when
the
actual
crisis
impended
they
were
smitten
with
confusion
ah
no
they
were
not
going
to
stand
up
and
be
shot
at
just
to
save
derrick
land
they
were
not
armed
what
did
annixter
and
osterman
take
them
for
no
sir
the
railroad
had
stolen
a
march
on
them
after
all
his
big
talk
derrick
had
allowed
them
to
be
taken
by
surprise
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
call
a
meeting
of
the
executive
committee
that
was
the
only
thing
as
for
going
down
there
with
no
weapons
in
their
hands
no
sir
that
was
asking
a
little
too
much
come
on
then
boys
shouted
osterman
turning
his
back
on
the
others
the
governor
says
to
meet
him
at
hooven
we
make
for
the
long
trestle
and
strike
the
trail
to
hooven
they
set
off
it
was
a
terrible
ride
twice
during
the
scrambling
descent
from
the
hills
presley
pony
fell
beneath
him
annixter
on
his
buckskin
and
osterman
on
his
thoroughbred
good
horsemen
both
led
the
others
setting
a
terrific
pace
the
hills
were
left
behind
broderson
creek
was
crossed
and
on
the
levels
of
quien
sabe
straight
through
the
standing
wheat
the
nine
horses
flogged
and
spurred
stretched
out
to
their
utmost
their
passage
through
the
wheat
sounded
like
the
rip
and
tear
of
a
gigantic
web
of
cloth
the
landscape
on
either
hand
resolved
itself
into
a
long
blur
tears
came
to
the
eyes
flying
pebbles
clods
of
earth
grains
of
wheat
flung
up
in
the
flight
stung
the
face
like
shot
osterman
thoroughbred
took
the
second
crossing
of
broderson
creek
in
a
single
leap
down
under
the
long
trestle
tore
the
cavalcade
in
a
shower
of
mud
and
gravel
up
again
on
the
further
bank
the
horses
blowing
like
steam
engines
on
into
the
trail
to
hooven
single
file
now
presley
pony
lagging
horse
bleeding
at
the
eyes
the
buckskin
game
as
a
fighting
cock
catching
her
second
wind
far
in
the
lead
now
distancing
even
the
english
thoroughbred
that
osterman
rode
at
last
hooven
unpainted
house
beneath
the
enormous
live
oak
tree
came
in
sight
across
the
lower
road
breaking
through
fences
and
into
the
yard
around
the
house
thundered
the
leaguers
magnus
was
waiting
for
them
the
riders
dismounted
hardly
less
exhausted
than
their
horses
why
where
all
the
men
annixter
demanded
of
magnus
broderson

here
and
cutter
replied
the
governor
no

more
men

are
only
nine
of
and
the
six
hundred
leaguers
who
were
going
to
rise
when
this
happened
exclaimed
garnett
bitterly
rot
the
league
cried
annixter
it
gone
to
pot
went
to
pieces
at
the
first
we
have
been
taken
by
surprise
gentlemen
after
all
said
magnus
totally
off
our
guard
but
there
are
eleven
of
us
it
is
well
what
the
game
has
the
marshal
come
how
many
men
are
with
him
the
united
states
marshal
from
san
francisco
explained
magnus
came
down
early
this
morning
and
stopped
at
guadalajara
we
learned
it
all
through
our
friends
in
bonneville
about
an
hour
ago
they
telephoned
me
and
broderson
behrman
met
him
and
provided
about
a
dozen
deputies
delaney
ruggles
and
christian
joined
them
at
guadalajara
they
left
guadalajara
going
towards
annixter
ranch
house
on
quien
sabe
they
are
serving
the
writs
in
ejectment
and
putting
the
dummy
buyers
in
possession
they
are
armed
behrman

with
where
are
they
now
cutter
is
watching
them
from
the
long
trestle
they
returned
to
guadalajara
they
are
there
well
observed
gethings
from
guadalajara
they
can
only
go
to
two
places
either
they
will
take
the
upper
road
and
go
on
to
next
or
they
will
take
the
lower
road
to
that
is
as
i
supposed
said
magnus
that
is
why
i
wanted
you
to
come
here
from
hooven
here
we
can
watch
both
roads
is
anybody
on
the
lookout
on
the
upper
road
cutter
he
is
on
the
long
say
observed
hooven
the
instincts
of
the
soldier
stirring
him
say
dose
feller
pretty
demn
schmart
i
tink
we
got
to
put
some
picket
way
oudt
bei
der
lower
roadt
alzoh
und
he
tek
dose
glassus
got
bei
um
say
look
at
dose
irregation
ditsch
dot
ditsch
he
run
righd
across
both
dose
road
hey
dat
some
fine
entrenchment
you
bedt
we
fighd
um
from
dose
in
fact
the
dry
irrigating
ditch
was
a
natural
trench
admirably
suited
to
the
purpose
crossing
both
roads
as
hooven
pointed
out
and
barring
approach
from
guadalajara
to
all
the
ranches
save
annixter
which
had
already
been
seized
gethings
departed
to
join
cutter
on
the
long
trestle
while
phelps
and
harran
taking
annixter
field
glasses
with
them
and
mounting
their
horses
went
out
towards
guadalajara
on
the
lower
road
to
watch
for
the
marshal
approach
from
that
direction
after
the
outposts
had
left
them
the
party
in
hooven
cottage
looked
to
their
weapons
long
since
every
member
of
the
league
had
been
in
the
habit
of
carrying
his
revolver
with
him
they
were
all
armed
and
in
addition
hooven
had
his
rifle
presley
alone
carried
no
weapon
the
main
room
of
hooven
house
in
which
the
leaguers
were
now
assembled
was
barren
but
tolerably
clean
an
old
clock
ticked
vociferously
on
a
shelf
in
one
corner
was
a
bed
with
a
patched
faded
quilt
in
the
centre
of
the
room
straddling
over
the
bare
floor
stood
a
pine
table
around
this
the
men
gathered
two
or
three
occupying
chairs
annixter
sitting
sideways
on
the
table
the
rest
standing
i
believe
gentlemen
said
magnus
that
we
can
go
through
this
day
without
bloodshed
i
believe
not
one
shot
need
be
fired
the
railroad
will
not
force
the
issue
will
not
bring
about
actual
fighting
when
the
marshal
realises
that
we
are
thoroughly
in
earnest
thoroughly
determined
i
am
convinced
that
he
will
there
were
murmurs
of
assent
look
here
said
annixter
if
this
thing
can
by
any
means
be
settled
peaceably
i
say
let
do
it
so
long
as
we
do
give
the
others
stared
was
this
annixter
who
spoke
the
hotspur
of
the
league
the
quarrelsome
irascible
fellow
who
loved
and
sought
a
quarrel
was
it
annixter
who
now
had
been
the
first
and
only
one
of
them
all
to
suffer
whose
ranch
had
been
seized
whose
household
possessions
had
been
flung
out
into
the
road
when
you
come
right
down
to
it
he
continued
killing
a
man
no
matter
what
he
done
to
you
is
a
serious
business
i
propose
we
make
one
more
attempt
to
stave
this
thing
off
let
see
if
we
ca
get
to
talk
with
the
marshal
himself
at
any
rate
warn
him
of
the
danger
of
going
any
further
boys
let
not
fire
the
first
shot
what
do
you
say
the
others
agreed
unanimously
and
promptly
and
old
broderson
tugging
uneasily
at
his
long
beard
added
no
no
no
violence
no
unnecessary
violence
that
is
i
should
hate
to
have
innocent
blood
on
my
hands
that
is
if
it
is
innocent
i
know
that
behrman
ah
he
is
a
a
surely
he
had
innocent
blood
on
his
head
that
dyke
affair
terrible
terrible
but
then
dyke
was
in
the
wrong
driven
to
it
though
the
railroad
did
drive
him
to
it
i
want
to
be
fair
and
just
to
there
a
team
coming
up
the
road
from
los
muertos
announced
presley
from
the
door
fair
and
just
to
everybody
murmured
old
broderson
wagging
his
head
frowning
perplexedly
i
do
want
to
to
to
harm
anybody
unless
they
harm

the
team
going
towards
guadalajara
enquired
garnett

the
door

do
want
him
to
take
any

to
the
marshal
and
i

said
presley
he
rode
out
towards
the
market

and
the
others
watching
from
the
road
in
front
of
hooven
saw
him
halt

an
excited
interview

they
could
hear
the
portuguese
expostulating
volubly
but
in
the
end

from
their
elevated
position
had
observed
the
marshal
party
leaving
guadalajara
by
the
lower
road
presley
told
them
of
the
decision
of
the
leaguers
not
to
fire
until
fired
upon
all
right
said
gethings
but
if
it
comes
to
a
that
means
it
all
up
with
at
least
one
of
us
delaney
never
misses
his
when
they
reached
hooven
again
they
found
that
the
leaguers
had
already
taken
their
position
in
the
ditch
the
plank
bridge
across
it
had
been
torn
up
magnus
two
long
revolvers
lying
on
the
embankment
in
front
of
him
was
in
the
middle
harran
at
his
side
on
either
side
some
five
feet
intervening
between
each
man
stood
the
other
leaguers
their
revolvers
ready
dabney
the
silent
old
man
had
taken
off
his
coat
take
your
places
between
osterman
and
broderson
said
magnus
as
the
three
men
rode
up
presley
he
added
i
forbid
you
to
take
any
part
in
this
yes
keep
him
out
of
it
cried
annixter
from
his
position
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
line
go
back
to
hooven
house
pres
and
look
after
the
horses
he
added
this
is
no
business
of
yours
and
keep
the
road
behind
us
clear
do
let
any
one
come
near
not
any
one
understand
presley
withdrew
leading
the
buckskin
and
the
horses
that
gethings
and
cutter
had
ridden
he
fastened
them
under
the
great
live
oak
and
then
came
out
and
stood
in
the
road
in
front
of
the
house
to
watch
what
was
going
on
in
the
ditch
shoulder
deep
the
leaguers
ready
watchful
waited
in
silence
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
white
shimmer
of
the
road
leading
to
guadalajara
where
hooven
enquired
cutter
i
do
know
osterman
replied
he
was
out
watching
the
lower
road
with
harran
derrick
oh
harran
he
called
is
hooven
coming
in
i
do
know
what
he
is
waiting
for
answered
harran
he
was
to
have
come
in
just
after
me
he
thought
maybe
the
marshal
party
might
make
a
feint
in
this
direction
then
go
around
by
the
upper
road
after
all
he
wanted
to
watch
them
a
little
longer
but
he
ought
to
be
here
think
he
take
a
shot
at
them
on
his
own
account
oh
no
he
would
do
maybe
they
took
him
well
that
to
be
thought
of
suddenly
there
was
a
cry
around
the
bend
of
the
road
in
front
of
them
came
a
cloud
of
dust
from
it
emerged
a
horse
head
hello
hello
there
remember
we
are
not
to
fire
perhaps
that
hooven
i
ca
see
is
it
there
only
seems
to
be
one
too
much
dust
for
one
annixter
who
had
taken
his
field
glasses
from
harran
adjusted
them
to
his
eyes
that
not
them
he
announced
presently
nor
hooven
either
a
then
after
another
moment
he
added
the
butcher
cart
from
the
tension
was
relaxed
the
men
drew
long
breaths
settling
back
in
their
places
do
we
let
him
go
on
governor
the
bridge
is
down
he
ca
go
by
and
we
must
not
let
him
go
back
we
shall
have
to
detain
him
and
question
him
i
wonder
the
marshal
let
him
the
cart
approached
at
a
lively
trot
anybody
else
in
that
cart
annixter
asked
magnus
look
carefully
it
may
be
a
ruse
it
is
strange
the
marshal
should
have
let
him
the
leaguers
roused
themselves
again
osterman
laid
his
hand
on
his
revolver
no
called
annixter
in
another
instant
no
there
only
one
man
in
the
cart
came
up
and
cutter
and
phelps
clambering
from
the
ditch
stopped
it
as
it
arrived
in
front
of
the
party
hey
what
what
exclaimed
the
young
butcher
pulling
up
is
that
bridge
broke
but
at
the
idea
of
being
held
the
boy
protested
at
top
voice
badly
frightened
bewildered
not
knowing
what
was
to
happen
next
no
no
i
got
my
meat
to
deliver
say
you
let
me
go
say
i
ai
got
nothing
to
do
with
he
tugged
at
the
reins
trying
to
turn
the
cart
about
cutter
with
his
parted
the
reins
just
back
of
the
bit
you
stay
where
you
are
m
son
for
a
while
we
not
going
to
hurt
you
but
you
are
not
going
back
to
town
till
we
say
so
did
you
pass
anybody
on
the
road
out
of
town
in
reply
to
the
leaguers
questions
the
young
butcher
at
last
told
them
he
had
passed
a
buggy
and
a
lot
of
men
on
horseback
just
beyond
the
railroad
tracks
they
were
headed
for
los
muertos
that
them
all
right
muttered
annixter
they
coming
by
this
road
the
butcher
horse
and
cart
were
led
to
one
side
of
the
road
and
the
horse
tied
to
the
fence
with
one
of
the
severed
lines
the
butcher
himself
was
passed
over
to
presley
who
locked
him
in
hooven
barn
well
what
the
devil
demanded
osterman
has
become
of
bismarck
in
fact
the
butcher
had
seen
nothing
of
hooven
the
minutes
were
passing
and
still
he
failed
to
appear
what
he
up
to
anyways
bet
you
what
you
like
they
caught
him
just
like
that
crazy
dutchman
to
get
excited
and
go
too
near
you
can
always
depend
on
hooven
to
lose
his
five
minutes
passed
then
ten
the
road
towards
guadalajara
lay
empty
baking
and
white
under
the
sun
well
the
marshal
and
behrman
do
seem
to
be
in
any
hurry
shall
i
go
forward
and
reconnoitre
governor
asked
harran
but
dabney
who
stood
next
to
annixter
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
and
without
speaking
pointed
down
the
road
annixter
looked
then
suddenly
cried
out
here
comes
the
german
galloped
into
sight
around
the
turn
of
the
road
his
rifle
laid
across
his
saddle
he
came
on
rapidly
pulled
up
and
dismounted
at
the
ditch

he
cried
trembling
with
excitement

unless

they
a
voices
uttered
the
cry
at
once
there
could
be
no
mistake
this
time
a
buggy
drawn
by
two
horses
came
into
view
around
the
curve
of
the
road
three
riders
accompanied
it
and
behind
these
seen
at
intervals
in
a
cloud
of
dust
were
two
three
five
six
others
this
then
was
behrman
with
the
united
states
marshal
and
his
posse
the
event
that
had
been
so
long
in
preparation
the
event
which
it
had
been
said
would
never
come
to
pass
the
last
trial
of
strength
the
last
fight
between
the
trust
and
the
people
the
direct
brutal
grapple
of
armed
men
the
law
defied
the
government
ignored
behold
here
it
was
close
at
hand
osterman
cocked
his
revolver
and
in
the
profound
silence
that
had
fallen
upon
the
scene
the
click
was
plainly
audible
from
end
to
end
of
the
line
remember
our
agreement
gentlemen
cried
magnus
in
a
warning
voice
mr
osterman
i
must
ask
you
to
let
down
the
hammer
of
your
no
one
answered
in
absolute
quiet
standing
motionless
in
their
places
the
leaguers
watched
the
approach
of
the
marshal
five
minutes
passed
the
riders
came
on
steadily
they
drew
nearer
the
grind
of
the
buggy
wheels
in
the
grit
and
dust
of
the
road
and
the
prolonged
clatter
of
the
horses
feet
began
to
make
itself
heard
the
leaguers
could
distinguish
the
faces
of
their
enemies
in
the
buggy
were
behrman
and
cyrus
ruggles
the
latter
driving
a
tall
man
in
a
frock
coat
and
slouched
hat
the
marshal
beyond
question
rode
at
the
left
of
the
buggy
delaney
carrying
a
winchester
at
the
right
christian
the
real
estate
broker
behrman
cousin
also
with
a
rifle
could
be
made
out
just
behind
the
marshal
back
of
these
riding
well
up
was
a
group
of
horsemen
indistinguishable
in
the
dust
raised
by
the
buggy
wheels
steadily
the
distance
between
the
leaguers
and
the
posse
diminished
do
let
them
get
too
close
governor
whispered
harran
when
behrman
buggy
was
about
one
hundred
yards
distant
from
the
irrigating
ditch
magnus
sprang
out
upon
the
road
leaving
his
revolvers
behind
him
he
beckoned
garnett
and
gethings
to
follow
and
the
three
ranchers
who
with
the
exception
of
broderson
were
the
oldest
men
present
advanced
without
arms
to
meet
the
marshal
magnus
cried
aloud
halt
where
you
from
their
places
in
the
ditch
annixter
osterman
dabney
harran
hooven
broderson
cutter
and
phelps
their
hands
laid
upon
their
revolvers
watched
silently
alert
keen
ready
for
anything
at
the
governor
words
they
saw
ruggles
pull
sharply
on
the
reins
the
buggy
came
to
a
standstill
the
riders
doing
likewise
magnus
approached
the
marshal
still
followed
by
garnett
and
gethings
and
began
to
speak
his
voice
was
audible
to
the
men
in
the
ditch
but
his
words
could
not
be
made
out
they
heard
the
marshal
reply
quietly
enough
and
the
two
shook
hands
delaney
came
around
from
the
side
of
the
buggy
his
horse
standing
before
the
team
across
the
road
he
leaned
from
the
saddle
listening
to
what
was
being
said
but
made
no
remark
from
time
to
time
behrman
and
ruggles
from
their
seats
in
the
buggy
interposed
a
sentence
or
two
into
the
conversation
but
at
first
so
far
as
the
leaguers
could
discern
neither
magnus
nor
the
marshal
paid
them
any
attention
they
saw
however
that
the
latter
repeatedly
shook
his
head
and
once
they
heard
him
exclaim
in
a
loud
voice
i
only
know
my
duty
then
gethings
turned
about
and
seeing
delaney
close
at
hand
addressed
an
unheard
remark
to
him
the
replied
curtly
and
the
words
seemed
to
anger
gethings
he
made
a
gesture
pointing
back
to
the
ditch
showing
the
intrenched
leaguers
to
the
posse
delaney
appeared
to
communicate
the
news
that
the
leaguers
were
on
hand
and
prepared
to
resist
to
the
other
members
of
the
party
they
all
looked
toward
the
ditch
and
plainly
saw
the
ranchers
there
standing
to
their
arms
but
meanwhile
ruggles
had
addressed
himself
more
directly
to
magnus
and
between
the
two
an
angry
discussion
was
going
forward
once
even
harran
heard
his
father
exclaim
the
statement
is
a
lie
and
no
one
knows
it
better
than
here
growled
annixter
to
dabney
who
stood
next
him
in
the
ditch
those
fellows
are
getting
too
close
look
at
them
edging
up
magnus
see
that
the
other
members
of
the
marshal
force
had
come
forward
from
their
places
behind
the
buggy
and
were
spread
out
across
the
road
some
of
them
were
gathered
about
magnus
garnett
and
gethings
and
some
were
talking
together
looking
and
pointing
towards
the
ditch
whether
acting
upon
signal
or
not
the
leaguers
in
the
ditch
could
not
tell
but
it
was
certain
that
one
or
two
of
the
posse
had
moved
considerably
forward
besides
this
delaney
had
now
placed
his
horse
between
magnus
and
the
ditch
and
two
others
riding
up
from
the
rear
had
followed
his
example
the
posse
surrounded
the
three
ranchers
and
by
now
everybody
was
talking
at
once
look
here
harran
called
to
annixter
this
wo
do
i
do
like
the
looks
of
this
thing
they
all
seem
to
be
edging
up
and
before
we
know
it
they
may
take
the
governor
and
the
other
men
they
ought
to
come
back
declared
annixter
somebody
ought
to
tell
them
that
those
fellows
are
creeping
by
now
the
angry
argument
between
the
governor
and
ruggles
had
become
more
heated
than
ever
their
voices
were
raised
now
and
then
they
made
furious
gestures
they
ought
to
come
back
cried
osterman
we
could
shoot
now
if
anything
should
happen
for
fear
of
hitting
well
it
sounds
as
though
something
were
going
to
happen
pretty
they
could
hear
gethings
and
delaney
wrangling
furiously
another
deputy
joined
in
i
going
to
call
the
governor
back
exclaimed
annixter
suddenly
clambering
out
of
the
ditch
no
no
cried
osterman
keep
in
the
ditch
they
ca
drive
us
out
if
we
keep
hooven
and
harran
who
had
instinctively
followed
annixter
hesitated
at
osterman
words
and
the
three
halted
irresolutely
on
the
road
before
the
ditch
their
weapons
in
their
hands
governor
shouted
harran
come
on
back
you
ca
do
still
the
wrangle
continued
and
one
of
the
deputies
advancing
a
little
from
out
the
group
cried
out
keep
back
there
keep
back
there
you
go
to
hell
will
you
shouted
harran
on
the
instant
you
on
my
oh
come
back
here
harran
called
osterman
that
ai
going
to
do
any
there
listen
suddenly
exclaimed
harran
the
governor
is
calling
us
come
on
i
osterman
got
out
of
the
ditch
and
came
forward
catching
harran
by
the
arm
and
pulling
him
back
he
did
call
do
get
excited
you
ruin
everything
get
back
into
the
ditch
but
cutter
phelps
and
the
old
man
dabney
misunderstanding
what
was
happening
and
seeing
osterman
leave
the
ditch
had
followed
his
example
all
the
leaguers
were
now
out
of
the
ditch
and
a
little
way
down
the
road
hooven
osterman
annixter
and
harran
in
front
dabney
phelps
and
cutter
coming
up
from
behind
keep
back
you
cried
the
deputy
again
in
the
group
around
behrman
buggy
gethings
and
delaney
were
yet
quarrelling
and
the
angry
debate
between
magnus
garnett
and
the
marshal
still
continued
till
this
moment
the
real
estate
broker
christian
had
taken
no
part
in
the
argument
but
had
kept
himself
in
the
rear
of
the
buggy
now
however
he
pushed
forward
there
was
but
little
room
for
him
to
pass
and
as
he
rode
by
the
buggy
his
horse
scraped
his
flank
against
the
hub
of
the
wheel
the
animal
recoiled
sharply
and
striking
against
garnett
threw
him
to
the
ground
delaney
horse
stood
between
the
buggy
and
the
leaguers
gathered
on
the
road
in
front
of
the
ditch
the
incident
indistinctly
seen
by
them
was
misinterpreted
garnett
had
not
yet
risen
when
hooven
raised
a
great
shout
hoch
der
kaiser
hoch
der
vaterland
with
the
words
he
dropped
to
one
knee
and
sighting
his
rifle
carefully
fired
into
the
group
of
men
around
the
buggy
instantly
the
revolvers
and
rifles
seemed
to
go
off
of
themselves
both
sides
deputies
and
leaguers
opened
fire
simultaneously
at
first
it
was
nothing
but
a
confused
roar
of
explosions
then
the
roar
lapsed
to
an
irregular
quick
succession
of
reports
shot
leaping
after
shot
then
a
moment
silence
and
last
of
all
regular
as
three
shots
at
exact
intervals
then
stillness
delaney
shot
through
the
stomach
slid
down
from
his
horse
and
on
his
hands
and
knees
crawled
from
the
road
into
the
standing
wheat
christian
fell
backward
from
the
saddle
toward
the
buggy
and
hung
suspended
in
that
position
his
head
and
shoulders
on
the
wheel
one
stiff
leg
still
across
his
saddle
hooven
in
attempting
to
rise
from
his
kneeling
position
received
a
rifle
ball
squarely
in
the
throat
and
rolled
forward
upon
his
face
old
broderson
crying
out
oh
shot
me
boys
staggered
sideways
his
head
bent
his
hands
rigid
at
his
sides
and
fell
into
the
ditch
osterman
blood
running
from
his
mouth
and
nose
turned
about
and
walked
back
presley
helped
him
across
the
irrigating
ditch
and
osterman
laid
himself
down
his
head
on
his
folded
arms
harran
derrick
dropped
where
he
stood
turning
over
on
his
face
and
lay
motionless
groaning
terribly
a
pool
of
blood
forming
under
his
stomach
the
old
man
dabney
silent
as
ever
received
his
death
speechless
he
fell
to
his
knees
got
up
again
fell
once
more
and
died

there
chairs

lamps
hilma
little
home
had
been
gutted
everything
had
been
taken
from

and
ruthlessly
flung
out
upon
the
road
everything
that
she
and
her
husband
had
bought
during
that
wonderful
week
after
their
marriage
here
was
the

enamelled
set
of
the

furniture
the
three
chairs
and

the

falling
out
spilling
their

its

so
brave

out
there
into
the
common
road
torn
from
its
place
from
the
discreet
intimacy
of
her
bridal
chamber
violated
profaned
flung
out
into
the
dust
and
garish
sunshine
for
all
men
to
stare
at
a
mockery
and
a
shame
to
hilma
it
was
as
though
something
of
herself
of
her
person
had
been
thus
exposed
and
degraded
all
that
she
held
sacred
pilloried
gibbeted
and
exhibited
to
the
world
derision
tears
of
anguish
sprang
to
her
eyes
a
red
flame
of
outraged
modesty
overspread
her
face

catching
her
throat

on

porch
of
the

long
trestle
and
hooven
when

found

of
the
german
house
and
indeed
all
the
surrounding
yard
crowded
with
people
an
overturned
buggy
lay
on
the
side
of
the
road
in
the
distance
its
horses
in
a
tangle
of
harness
held
by
two
or
three
men
she
saw
buckboard
under
the
live
oak
and
near
it
a
second
buggy
which
she
recognised
as
belonging
to
a
doctor
in
guadalajara

hilma
the
young

and
together
they
pushed
their
way
through
the
crowd
of
men
and
women
and
entered
the
yard
the
throng
gave
way
before
the
two
women
parting
to
right
and
left
without
a
word
presley
cried
derrick

entered
the
house
the
front
room
was
full
of
men
she
was
dimly
conscious
of
cyrus
ruggles
and
behrman
both
deadly
pale
talking
earnestly
and
in
whispers
to
cutter
and
phelps
there
was
a
strange
acrid
odour
of
an
unfamiliar
drug
in
the
air
on
the
table
before
her
was
a
satchel
surgical
instruments
rolls
of
bandages
and
a
blue
oblong
paper
box
full
of
cotton
but
above
the
hushed
noises
of
voices
and
footsteps
one
terrible
sound
made
itself
heard
the
prolonged
rasping
sound
of
breathing
half
choked
laboured
agonised
where
is
my
husband
she
cried
she
pushed
the
men
aside
she
saw
magnus
bareheaded

half
naked
his
body
swathed
in

a
white
face
to
her
where

dead
body
of
her
husband
lying
upon
the
bed
she
did
not
cry
out
she
said
no

she
went
to
the
bed
and
sitting
upon
it
took
annixter
head
in
her
lap
holding
it
gently
between
her
hands
thereafter
she
did
not
move
but
sat
holding
her
dead
husband
head
in
her
lap
looking
vaguely
about
from
face
to
face
of
those
in
the
room
while
without
a
sob
without
a
cry
the
great
tears
filled
her
eyes
and
rolled
slowly
down
upon
her
cheeks
on
hearing
that
his
wife
was
outside

quickly
forward

threw
herself
into
his
arms

pushed
by

and
breaking
through
the
group
that
surrounded
her
son
sank
on
her
knees
beside
him
moaning
in
compassion
and
terror
harran

straight
and
rigid
upon
the
floor
his
head
propped
by
a
pillow
his
coat
that

been
taken
off

over
his
chest
one
leg
of

trousers
was
soaked
through
and
through
with
blood
his
eyes
were
and
with
the
regularity
of
a
machine
the
eyeballs
twitched
and
twitched
his
face
was
so
white
that
it
made
his
yellow
hair
look
brown
while
from
his
opened
mouth
there
issued
that
loud
and
terrible
sound
of
guttering
rasping
laboured
breathing
that
gagged
and
choked
and
gurgled
with
every
inhalation
oh

from

to

the
surviving
members
of
both
leaguers
and
deputies
the
warring
factions
of
the
railroad
and
the
people
mingled
together
now
with
no
thought
of
hostility
presley
helped
the
doctor
to
cover
body
behrman
and
ruggles
held
bowls
of
water
while
osterman
was
attended
to
the
horror
of
that
dreadful
business
had
driven
all
other
considerations
from
the
mind
the
sworn
foes
of
the
last
hour
had
no
thought
of
anything
but
to
care
for
those
whom
in
their
fury
they
had
shot
down
the
marshal
abandoning
for
that
day
the
attempt
to
serve
the
writs
departed
for
san

the
bodies

been
brought
in
from
the
road
where
they
fell

had
been
laid
upon
the
bed
those
of

and
hooven
whose
wounds
had
all
been
in

were
covered
with
a
tablecloth
upon
the
floor

made
for
the

rode
into

to
bring
out
the

there
and
to
telephone
to
bonneville
for

osterman
had
not
at
any
time
since
the
shooting
lost
consciousness
he
lay
upon
the
floor
of
hooven
house
bare
to
the
waist
bandages
of
adhesive
tape
reeved
about
his
abdomen
and
shoulder
his
eyes
were
presley
who
looked
after
him
pending
the
arrival
of
a
hack
from
bonneville
that
was
to
take
him
home
knew
that
he
was
in
agony
but
this
poser
this
silly
fellow
this
cracker
of
jokes
whom
no
one
had
ever
taken
very
seriously
at
the
last
redeemed
himself
when
at
length
the
doctor
had
arrived
he
had
for
the
first
time
opened
his
eyes
i
can
wait
he
said
take
harran
and
when
at
length
his
turn
had
come
and
while
the
sweat
rolled
from
his
forehead
as
the
doctor
began
probing
for
the
bullet
he
had
reached
out
his
free
arm
and
taken
presley
hand
in
his
gripping
it
harder
and
harder
as
the
probe
entered
the
wound
his
breath
came
short
through
his
nostrils
his
face
the
face
of
a
comic
actor
with
its
high
cheek
bones
bald
forehead
and
salient
ears
grew
paler
and
paler
his
great
slit
of
a
mouth
shut
tight
but
he
uttered
no
groan
when
the
worst
anguish
was
over
and
he
could
find
breath
to
speak
his
first
words
had
been
were
any
of
the
others
badly
hurt
as
presley
stood
by
the
door
of
the
house
after
bringing
in
a
pail
of
water
for
the
doctor
he
was
aware
of
a
party
of
men
who
had
struck
off
from
the
road
on
the
other
side
of
the
irrigating
ditch
and
were
advancing
cautiously
into
the
field
of
wheat
he
wondered
what
it
meant
and
cutter
coming
up
at
that
moment
presley
asked
him
if
he
knew
it
delaney
said
cutter
it
seems
that
when
he
was
shot
he
crawled
off
into
the
wheat
they
are
looking
for
him
presley
had
forgotten
all
about
the
buster
and
had
only
a
vague
recollection
of
seeing
him
slide
from
his
horse
at
the
beginning
of
the
fight
anxious
to
know
what
had
become
of
him
he
hurried
up
and
joined
the
party
of
searchers
we
better
look
out
said
one
of
the
young
men
how
we
go
fooling
around
in
here
if
he
alive
yet
he
just
as
liable
as
not
to
think
we
after
him
and
take
a
shot
at
i
guess
there
ai
much
fight
left
in
him
another
answered
look
at
the
wheat
lord
he
bled
like
a
stuck
here
his
hat
abruptly
exclaimed
the
leader
of
the
party
he
be
far
off
let
call
they
called
repeatedly
without
getting
any
answer
then
proceeded
cautiously
all
at
once
the
men
in
advance
stopped
so
suddenly
that
those
following
carromed
against
them
there
was
an
outburst
of
exclamation
here
he
is
good
lord
sure
that
poor
fellow
poor
the
lay
on
his
back
deep
in
the
wheat
his
knees
drawn
up
his
eyes
wide
open
his
lips
brown
rigidly
gripped
in
one
hand
was
his
empty
revolver
the
men
farm
hands
from
the
neighbouring
ranches
young
fellows
from
guadalajara
drew
back
in
instinctive
repulsion
one
at
length
ventured
near
peering
down
into
the
face
is

those
in
the
rear

down
and
laid
his
hand
on
the
breast

back
to
the
road
for
planks
from
the
broken
bridge
when
they
returned
with
these
a
litter
was
improvised
and
throwing
their
coats
over
the
body
the
party
carried
it
back
to
the
road
the
doctor
was
summoned
and
declared

an
hour

one
of
the
group

the
other
i

always
tell
by
whether

heart

or
but
all
at
once
there
was
a
commotion
the
wagon
containing
hooven
minna
and
little
hilda

the
bedroom
of
the
house
and
to
this
room
hooven
minna
still
at
her
heels
proceeded
guided
by
an
instinct
born
of
the
occasion
those
in
the
outside
room
saying
no
word
made
way
for
them
they
entered
closing
the
door
behind
them
and
through
all
the
rest
of
that
terrible
day
no
sound
nor
sight
of
them
was
had
by
those
who
crowded
into
and
about
that
house
of
death
of
all
the
main
actors
of
the
tragedy
of
the
fight
in
the
ditch
they
remained
the
least
noted
obtruded
themselves
the
least
upon
the
world
observation
they
were
for
the
moment
forgotten
but
by
now
hooven
house
was
the
centre
of
an
enormous
crowd
a
vast
concourse
of
people
from
bonneville
from
guadalajara
from
the
ranches
swelled
by
the
thousands
who
had
that
morning
participated
in
the
rabbit
drive
surged
about
the
place
men
and
women
young
boys
young
girls
farm
hands
villagers
townspeople
ranchers
railroad
employees
mexicans
spaniards
portuguese
presley
returning
from
the
search
for
delaney
body
had
to
fight
his
way
to
the
house
again
and
from
all
this
multitude
there
rose
an
indefinable
murmur
as
yet
there
was
no
menace
in
it
no
anger
it
was
confusion
merely
bewilderment
the
first
oh
that
greets
the
news
of
some
great
tragedy
the
people
had
taken
no
thought
as
yet
curiosity
was
their
dominant
impulse
every
one
wanted
to
see
what
had
been
done
failing
that
to
hear
of
it
and
failing
that
to
be
near
the
scene
of
the
affair
the
crowd
of
people
packed
the
road
in
front
of
the
house
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
either
direction
they
balanced
themselves
upon
the
lower
strands
of
the
barbed
wire
fence
in
their
effort
to
see
over
each
others
shoulders
they
stood
on
the
seats
of
their
carts
buggies
and
farm
wagons
a
few
even
upon
the
saddles
of
their
riding
horses
they
crowded
pushed
struggled
surged
forward
and
back
without
knowing
why
converging
incessantly
upon
hooven
house
when
at
length
presley
got
to
the
gate
he
found
a
drawn
up
before
it
between
the
gate
and
the
door
of
the
house
a
lane
had
been
formed
and
as
he
paused
there
a
moment
a
group
of
leaguers
among
whom
were
garnett
and
gethings
came
slowly
from
the
door
carrying
old
broderson
in
their
arms
the
doctor
bareheaded
and
in
his
shirt
sleeves
squinting
in
the
sunlight
attended
them
repeating
at
every
step
slow
slow
take
it
easy
old
broderson
was
unconscious
his
face
was
not
pale
no
bandages
could
be
seen
with
infinite
precautions
the
men
bore
him
to
the
and
deposited
him
on
the
back
seat
the
rain
flaps
were
let
down
on
one
side
to
shut
off
the
gaze
of
the
multitude
but
at
this
point
a
moment
of
confusion
ensued
presley
because
of
half
a
dozen
people
who
stood
in
his
way
could
not
see
what
was
going
on
there
were
exclamations
hurried
movements
the
doctor
uttered
a
sharp
command
and
a
man
ran
back
to
the
house
returning
on
the
instant
with
the
doctor
satchel
by
this
time
presley
was
close
to
the
wheels
of
the
and
could
see
the
doctor
inside
the
vehicle
bending
over
old
broderson
here
it
is
here
it
is
exclaimed
the
man
who
had
been
sent
to
the
house
i
wo
need
it
answered
the
doctor
he
dying
at
the
words
a
great
hush
widened
throughout
the
throng
near
at
hand
some
men
took
off
their
hats
stand
back
protested
the
doctor
quietly
stand
back
good
people
the
crowd
bore
back
a
little
in
the
silence
a
woman
began
to
sob
the
seconds
passed
then
a
minute
the
horses
of
the
shifted
their
feet
and
whisked
their
tails
driving
off
the
flies
at
length
the
doctor
got
down
from
the
letting
down
the
on
that
side
as
well
will
somebody
go
home
with
the
body
he
asked
gethings
stepped
forward
and
took
his
place
by
the
driver
the
drove
away
presley
reentered
the
house
during
his
absence
it
had
been
cleared
of
all
but
one
or
two
of
the
leaguers
who
had
taken
part
in
the
fight
hilma
still
sat
on
the
bed
with
annixter
head
in
her
lap
behrman
ruggles
and
all
the
railroad
party
had
gone
osterman
had
been
taken
away
in
a
hack
and
the
tablecloth
over
dabney
body
replaced
with
a
sheet
but
still
unabated
agonised
raucous
came
the
sounds
of
harran
breathing
everything
possible
had
already
been
done
for
the
moment
it
was
out
of
the
question
to
attempt
to
move
him
his
mother
and
father
were
at
his
side
magnus
with
a
face
of
stone
his
look
fixed
on
those
persistently
twitching
eyes
annie
derrick
crouching
at
her
side
one
of
his
hands
in
hers
fanning
his
face
continually
with
the
crumpled
sheet
of
an
old
newspaper
presley
on
joined
the
group
looking
on
attentively
one
of
the
surgeons
who
had
been
called
from
bonneville
stood
close
by
watching
harran
face
his
arms
folded
how
is
he
presley
whispered
he
wo
live
the
other
responded
by
degrees
the
choke
and
gurgle
of
the
breathing
became
more
irregular
and
the
lids
closed
over
the
twitching
eyes
all
at
once
the
breath
ceased
magnus
shot
an
inquiring
glance
at
the
surgeon
he
is
dead
derrick
the
surgeon
replied
annie
derrick
with
a
cry
that
rang
through
all
the
house
stretched
herself
over
the
body
of
her
son
her
head
upon
his
breast
and
the
governor
great
shoulders
bowed
never
to
rise
again
god
help
me
and
forgive
me
he
groaned
presley
rushed
from
the
house
beside
himself
with
grief
with
horror
with
pity
and
with
mad
insensate
rage
on
the
porch
outside
caraher
met
him

began
the
yes

cried
presley
they
all

from

too
i
a
red
in
course
of
time
a
farm
wagon
from
bonneville
arrived
at
hooven
the
bodies
of
annixter
and
harran
were
placed
in
it
and
it
drove
down
the
lower
road
towards
the
los
muertos
ranch
houses
the
bodies
of
delaney
and
christian
had
already
been
carried
to
guadalajara
and
thence
taken
by
train
to
bonneville
hilma
followed
the
farm
wagon
in
the
derricks
with
magnus
and
his
wife
during
all
that
ride
none
of
them
spoke
a
word
it
had
been
arranged
that
since
quien
sabe
was
in
the
hands
of
the
railroad
hilma
should
come
to
los
muertos
to
that
place
also
annixter
body
was
carried
later
on
in
the
day
when
it
was
almost
evening
the
undertaker
black
wagon
passed
the
derricks
home
ranch
on
its
way
from
hooven
and
turned
into
the
county
road
towards
bonneville
the
initial
excitement
of
the
affair
of
the
irrigating
ditch
had
died
down
the
crowd
long
since
had
dispersed
by
the
time
the
wagon
passed
caraher
saloon
the
sun
had
set
night
was
coming
on
and
the
black
wagon
went
on
through
the
darkness
unattended
ignored
solitary
carrying
the
dead
body
of
dabney
the
silent
old
man
of
whom
nothing
was
known
but
his
name
who
made
no
friends
whom
nobody
knew
or
spoke
to
who
had
come
from
no
one
knew
whence
and
who
went
no
one
knew
whither
towards
midnight
of
that
same
day
dyke
was
awakened
by
the
sounds
of
groaning
in
the
room
next
to
hers
magnus
derrick
was
not
so
occupied
by
harran
death
that
he
could
not
think
of
others
who
were
in
distress
and
when
he
had
heard
that
dyke
and
sidney
like
hilma
had
been
turned
out
of
quien
sabe
he
had
thrown
open
los
muertos
to
them
though
he
warned
them
it
is
precarious
hospitality
at
the
until
late
dyke
had
sat
up
with
hilma
comforting
her
as
best
she
could
rocking
her
to
and
fro
in
her
arms
crying
with
her
trying
to
quiet
her
for
once
having
given
way
to
her
grief
hilma
wept
with
a
terrible
anguish
and
a
violence
that
racked
her
from
head
to
foot
and
at
last
worn
out
a
little
child
again
had
sobbed
herself
to
sleep
in
the
older
woman
arms
and
as
a
little
child
dyke
had
put
her
to
bed
and
had
retired
herself
aroused
a
few
hours
later
by
the
sounds
of
a
distress
that
was
physical
as
well
as
mental
dyke
hurried
into
hilma
room
carrying
the
lamp
with
her
dyke
needed
no
enlightenment
she
woke
presley
and
besought
him
to
telephone
to
bonneville
at
once
summoning
a
doctor
that
night
hilma
in
great
pain
suffered
a
miscarriage
presley
did
not
close
his
eyes
once
during
the
night
he
did
not
even
remove
his
clothes
long
after
the
doctor
had
departed
and
that
house
of
tragedy
had
quieted
down
he
still
remained
in
his
place
by
the
open
window
of
his
little
room
looking
off
across
the
leagues
of
growing
wheat
watching
the
slow
kindling
of
the
dawn
horror
weighed
intolerably
upon
him
monstrous
things
huge
terrible
whose
names
he
knew
only
too
well
whirled
at
a
gallop
through
his
imagination
or
rose
spectral
and
grisly
before
the
eyes
of
his
mind
harran
dead
annixter
dead
broderson
dead
osterman
perhaps
even
at
that
moment
dying
why
these
men
had
made
up
his
world
annixter
had
been
his
best
friend
harran
his
almost
daily
companion
broderson
and
osterman
were
familiar
to
him
as
brothers
they
were
all
his
associates
his
good
friends
the
group
was
his
environment
belonging
to
his
daily
life
and
he
standing
there
in
the
dust
of
the
road
by
the
irrigating
ditch
had
seen
them
shot
he
found
himself
suddenly
at
his
table
the
candle
burning
at
his
elbow
his
journal
before
him
writing
swiftly
the
desire
for
expression
the
craving
for
outlet
to
the
thoughts
that
clamoured
tumultuous
at
his
brain
never
more
insistent
more
imperious
thus
he
wrote

he
spent
the
night
over
his
journal
writing
down
such
thoughts
as
these
or
walking
the
floor
from
wall
to
wall
or
seized
at
times
with
unreasoning
horror
and
blind
rage
flinging
himself
face
downward
upon
his
bed
vowing
with
inarticulate
cries
that
neither
behrman
nor
shelgrim
should
ever
live
to
consummate
their
triumph
morning
came
and
with
it
the
daily
papers
and
news
presley
did
not
even
glance
at
the
bonneville
published
two
other
daily
journals
that
professed
to
voice
the
will
and
reflect
the
temper
of
the
people
and
these
he
read
eagerly
osterman
was
yet
alive
and
there
were
chances
of
his
recovery
the
league
some
three
hundred
of
its
members
had
gathered
at
bonneville
over
night
and
were
patrolling
the
streets
and
still
resolved
to
keep
the
peace
were
even
guarding
the
railroad
shops
and
buildings
furthermore
the
leaguers
had
issued
manifestoes
urging
all
citizens
to
preserve
law
and
order
yet
summoning
an
indignation
meeting
to
be
convened
that
afternoon
at
the
city
opera
house
it
appeared
from
the
newspapers
that
those
who
obstructed
the
marshal
in
the
discharge
of
his
duty
could
be
proceeded
against
by
the
district
attorney
on
information
or
by
bringing
the
matter
before
the
grand
jury
but
the
grand
jury
was
not
at
that
time
in
session
and
it
was
known
that
there
were
no
funds
in
the
marshal
office
to
pay
expenses
for
the
summoning
of
jurors
or
the
serving
of
processes
behrman
and
ruggles
in
interviews
stated
that
the
railroad
withdrew
entirely
from
the
fight
the
matter
now
according
to
them
was
between
the
leaguers
and
the
united
states
government
they
washed
their
hands
of
the
whole
business
the
ranchers
could
settle
with
washington
but
it
seemed
that
congress
had
recently
forbade
the
use
of
troops
for
civil
purposes
the
whole
matter
of
the
contest
was
evidently
for
the
moment
to
be
left
in
status
quo
but
to
presley
mind
the
most
important
piece
of
news
that
morning
was
the
report
of
the
action
of
the
railroad
upon
hearing
of
the
battle
instantly
bonneville
had
been
isolated
not
a
single
local
train
was
running
not
one
of
the
through
trains
made
any
halt
at
the
station
the
mails
were
not
moved
further
than
this
by
some
arrangement
difficult
to
understand
the
telegraph
operators
at
bonneville
and
guadalajara
acting
under
orders
refused
to
receive
any
telegrams
except
those
emanating
from
railway
officials
the
story
of
the
fight
the
story
creating
the
first
impression
was
to
be
told
to
san
francisco
and
the
outside
world
by
behrman
ruggles
and
the
local
and
agents
an
hour
before
breakfast
the
undertakers
arrived
and
took
charge
of
the
bodies
of
harran
and
annixter
presley
saw
neither
hilma
magnus
nor
derrick
the
doctor
came
to
look
after
hilma
he
breakfasted
with
dyke
and
presley
and
from
him
presley
learned
that
hilma
would
recover
both
from
the
shock
of
her
husband
death
and
from
her
miscarriage
of
the
previous
night
she
ought
to
have
her
mother
with
her
said
the
physician
she
does
nothing
but
call
for
her
or
beg
to
be
allowed
to
go
to
her
i
have
tried
to
get
a
wire
through
to
tree
but
the
company
will
not
take
it
and
even
if
i
could
get
word
to
her
how
could
she
get
down
here
there
are
no
but
presley
found
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
stay
at
los
muertos
that
day
gloom
and
the
shadow
of
tragedy
brooded
heavy
over
the
place
a
great
silence
pervaded
everything
a
silence
broken
only
by
the
subdued
coming
and
going
of
the
undertaker
and
his
assistants
when
presley
having
resolved
to
go
into
bonneville
came
out
through
the
doorway
of
the
house
he
found
the
undertaker
tying
a
long
strip
of
crape
to
the
presley
saddled
his
pony
and
rode
into
town
by
this
time
after
long
hours
of
continued
reflection
upon
one
subject
a
sombre
brooding
malevolence
a
desire
of
revenge
had
grown
big
within
his
mind
the
first
numbness
had
passed
off
familiarity
with
what
had
been
done
had
blunted
the
edge
of
horror
and
now
the
impulse
of
retaliation
prevailed
at
first
the
sullen
anger
of
defeat
the
sense
of
outrage
had
only
smouldered
but
the
more
he
brooded
the
fiercer
flamed
his
rage
sudden
paroxysms
of
wrath
gripped
him
by
the
throat
abrupt
outbursts
of
fury
injected
his
eyes
with
blood
he
ground
his
teeth
his
mouth
filled
with
curses
his
hands
clenched
till
they
grew
white
and
bloodless
was
the
railroad
to
triumph
then
in
the
end
after
all
those
months
of
preparation
after
all
those
grandiloquent
resolutions
after
all
the
arrogant
presumption
of
the
league
the
league
what
a
farce
what
had
it
amounted
to
when
the
crisis
came
was
the
trust
to
crush
them
all
so
easily
was
behrman
to
swallow
los
muertos
behrman
presley
saw
him
plainly
huge
rotund
white
saw
his
jowl
tremulous
and
obese
the
roll
of
fat
over
his
collar
sprinkled
with
sparse
hairs
the
great
stomach
with
its
brown
linen
vest
and
heavy
watch
chain
of
hollow
links
clinking
against
the
buttons
of
imitation
pearl
and
this
man
was
to
crush
magnus
derrick
had
already
stamped
the
life
from
such
men
as
harran
and
annixter
this
man
in
the
name
of
the
trust
was
to
grab
los
muertos
as
he
had
grabbed
quien
sabe
and
after
los
muertos
ranch
then
osterman
then
others
and
still
others
the
whole
valley
the
whole
state
presley
beat
his
forehead
with
his
clenched
fist
as
he
rode
on
no
he
cried
no
kill
him
kill
him
kill
him
with
my
the
idea
of
it
put
him
beside
himself
oh
to
sink
his
fingers
deep
into
the
white
fat
throat
of
the
man
to
clutch
like
iron
into
the
great
puffed
jowl
of
him
to
wrench
out
the
life
to
batter
it
out
strangle
it
out
to
pay
him
back
for
the
long
years
of
extortion
and
oppression
to
square
accounts
for
bribed
jurors
bought
judges
corrupted
legislatures
to
have
justice
for
the
trick
of
the
ranchers
railroad
commission
the
charlatanism
of
the
ten
per
cent
cut
the
ruin
of
dyke
the
seizure
of
quien
sabe
the
murder
of
harran
the
assassination
of
annixter
it
was
in
such
mood
that
he
reached
caraher
the
had
just
opened
his
place
and
was
standing
in
his
doorway
smoking
his
pipe
presley
dismounted
and
went
in
and
the
two
had
a
long
talk
when
three
hours
later
presley
came
out
of
the
saloon
and
rode
on
towards
bonneville
his
face
was
very
pale
his
lips
shut
tight
resolute
determined
his
manner
was
that
of
a
man
whose
mind
is
made
up
the
hour
for
the
mass
meeting
at
the
opera
house
had
been
set
for
one
but
long
before
noon
the
street
in
front
of
the
building
and
in
fact
all
the
streets
in
its
vicinity
were
packed
from
side
to
side
with
a
shifting
struggling
surging
and
excited
multitude
there
were
few
women
in
the
throng
but
hardly
a
single
male
inhabitant
of
either
bonneville
or
guadalajara
was
absent
men
had
even
come
from
visalia
and
pixley
it
was
no
longer
the
crowd
of
curiosity
seekers
that
had
thronged
around
hooven
place
by
the
irrigating
ditch
the
people
were
no
longer
confused
bewildered
a
full
realisation
of
just
what
had
been
done
the
day
before
was
clear
now
in
the
minds
of
all
business
was
suspended
nearly
all
the
stores
were
closed
since
early
morning
the
members
of
the
league
had
put
in
an
appearance
and
rode
from
point
to
point
their
rifles
across
their
saddle
pommels
then
by
ten
the
streets
had
begun
to
fill
up
the
groups
on
the
corners
grew
and
merged
into
one
another
pedestrians
unable
to
find
room
on
the
sidewalks
took
to
the
streets
hourly
the
crowd
increased
till
shoulders
touched
and
elbows
till
free
circulation
became
impeded
then
congested
then
impossible
the
crowd
a
solid
mass
was
wedged
tight
from
store
front
to
store
front
and
from
all
this
throng
this
single
unit
this
living
breathing
organism
the
people
there
rose
a
droning
terrible
note
it
was
not
yet
the
wild
fierce
clamour
of
riot
and
insurrection
shrill
high
pitched
but
it
was
a
beginning
the
growl
of
the
awakened
brute
feeling
the
iron
in
its
flank
heaving
up
its
head
with
bared
teeth
the
throat
vibrating
to
the
long
indrawn
snarl
of
wrath
thus
the
forenoon
passed
while
the
people
their
bulk
growing
hourly
vaster
kept
to
the
streets
moving
slowly
backward
and
forward
oscillating
in
the
grooves
of
the
thoroughfares
the
steady
growl
rising
continually
into
the
hot
still
air
then
at
length
about
twelve
the
movement
of
the
throng
assumed
definite
direction
it
set
towards
the
opera
house
presley
who
had
left
his
pony
at
the
city
livery
stable
found
himself
caught
in
the
current
and
carried
slowly
forward
in
its
direction
his
arms
were
pinioned
to
his
sides
by
the
press
the
crush
against
his
body
was
all
but
he
could
hardly
draw
his
breath
all
around
him
rose
and
fell
wave
after
wave
of
faces
hundreds
upon
hundreds
thousands
upon
thousands
red
lowering
sullen
all
were
set
in
one
direction
and
slowly
slowly
they
advanced
crowding
closer
till
they
almost
touched
one
another
for
reasons
that
were
inexplicable
great
tumultuous
heavings
like
of
an
incoming
tide
surged
over
and
through
the
multitude
at
times
presley
lifted
from
his
feet
was
swept
back
back
back
with
the
crowd
till
the
entrance
of
the
opera
house
was
half
a
block
away
then
the
returning
billow
beat
back
again
and
swung
him
along
gasping
staggering
clutching
till
he
was
landed
once
more
in
the
vortex
of
frantic
action
in
front
of
the
foyer
here
the
waves
were
shorter
quicker
the
crushing
pressure
on
all
sides
of
his
body
left
him
without
strength
to
utter
the
cry
that
rose
to
his
lips
then
suddenly
the
whole
mass
of
struggling
stamping
fighting
writhing
men
about
him
seemed
as
it
were
to
rise
to
lift
multitudinous
swelling
gigantic
a
mighty
rush
dashed
presley
forward
in
its
leap
there
was
a
moment
whirl
of
confused
sights
congested
faces
opened
mouths
bloodshot
eyes
clutching
hands
a
outburst
of
furious
sound
shouts
cheers
oaths
a
moment
jam
wherein
presley
veritably
believed
his
ribs
must
snap
like
pipestems
and
he
was
carried
dazed
breathless
helpless
an
atom
on
the
crest
of
a
wave
up
the
steps
of
the
opera
house
on
into
the
vestibule
through
the
doors
and
at
last
into
the
auditorium
of
the
house
itself
there
was
a
mad
rush
for
places
men
disdaining
the
aisle
stepped
from
one
orchestra
chair
to
another
striding
over
the
backs
of
seats
leaving
the
print
of
dusty
feet
upon
the
red
plush
cushions
in
a
twinkling
the
house
was
filled
from
stage
to
topmost
gallery
the
aisles
were
packed
solid
even
on
the
edge
of
the
stage
itself
men
were
sitting
a
black
fringe
on
either
side
of
the
footlights
the
curtain
was
up
disclosing
a
scene
the
flats
leaning
at
perilous
angles
that
represented
some
sort
of
terrace
the
pavement
alternate
squares
of
black
and
white
marble
while
red
white
and
yellow
flowers
were
represented
as
growing
from
urns
and
vases
a
long
double
row
of
chairs
stretched
across
the
scene
from
wing
to
wing
flanking
a
table
covered
with
a
red
cloth
on
which
was
set
a
pitcher
of
water
and
a
speaker
gavel
promptly
these
chairs
were
filled
up
with
members
of
the
league
the
audience
cheering
as
certain
figures
made
their
appearance
garnett
of
the
ruby
ranch
gethings
of
the
san
pablo
keast
of
the
ranch
of
the
same
name
chattern
of
the
bonanza
elderly
men
bearded
slow
of
speech
deliberate
garnett
opened
the
meeting
his
speech
was
plain
straightforward
he
simply
told
what
had
happened
he
announced
that
certain
resolutions
were
to
be
drawn
up
he
introduced
the
next
speaker
this
one
pleaded
for
moderation
he
was
conservative
all
along
he
had
opposed
the
idea
of
armed
resistance
except
as
the
very
last
resort
he
deplored
the
terrible
affair
of
yesterday
he
begged
the
people
to
wait
in
patience
to
attempt
no
more
violence
he
informed
them
that
armed
guards
of
the
league
were
at
that
moment
patrolling
los
muertos
broderson
and
osterman
it
was
well
known
that
the
united
states
marshal
confessed
himself
powerless
to
serve
the
writs
there
would
be
no
more
bloodshed
we
have
had
he
continued
bloodshed
enough
and
i
want
to
say
right
here
that
i
am
not
so
sure
but
what
yesterday
terrible
affair
might
have
been
avoided
a
gentleman
whom
we
all
esteem
who
from
the
first
has
been
our
recognised
leader
is
at
this
moment
mourning
the
loss
of
a
young
son
killed
before
his
eyes
god
knows
that
i
sympathise
as
do
we
all
in
the
affliction
of
our
president
i
am
sorry
for
him
my
heart
goes
out
to
him
in
this
hour
of
distress
but
at
the
same
time
the
position
of
the
league
must
be
defined
we
owe
it
to
ourselves
we
owe
it
to
the
people
of
this
county
the
league
armed
for
the
very
purpose
of
preserving
the
peace
not
of
breaking
it
we
believed
that
with
six
hundred
armed
and
drilled
men
at
our
disposal
ready
to
muster
at
a
moment
call
we
could
so
overawe
any
attempt
to
expel
us
from
our
lands
that
such
an
attempt
would
not
be
made
until
the
cases
pending
before
the
supreme
court
had
been
decided
if
when
the
enemy
appeared
in
our
midst
yesterday
they
had
been
met
by
six
hundred
rifles
it
is
not
conceivable
that
the
issue
would
have
been
forced
no
fight
would
have
ensued
and
we
would
not
have
to
mourn
the
deaths
of
four
of
our
a
mistake
has
been
made
and
we
of
the
league
must
not
be
held
the
speaker
sat
down
amidst
loud
applause
from
the
leaguers
and
less
pronounced
demonstrations
on
the
part
of
the
audience
a
second
leaguer
took
his
place
a
tall
clumsy
man
i
want
to
second
what
my
colleague
has
just
said
he
began
this
matter
of
resisting
the
marshal
when
he
tried
to
put
the
railroad
dummies
in
possession
on
the
ranches
around
here
was
all
talked
over
in
the
committee
meetings
of
the
league
long
ago
it
never
was
our
intention
to
fire
a
single
shot
no
such
absolute
authority
as
was
assumed
yesterday
was
delegated
to
anybody
our
esteemed
president
is
all
right
but
we
all
know
that
he
is
a
man
who
loves
authority
and
who
likes
to
go
his
own
gait
without
accounting
to
anybody
we
the
rest
of
us
leaguers
never
were
informed
as
to
what
was
going
on
we
supposed
of
course
that
watch
was
being
kept
on
the
railroad
so
as
we
be
taken
by
surprise
as
we
were
yesterday
and
it
seems
no
watch
was
kept
at
all
or
if
there
was
it
was
mighty
ineffective
our
idea
was
to
forestall
any
movement
on
the
part
of
the
railroad
and
then
when
we
knew
the
marshal
was
coming
down
to
call
a
meeting
of
our
executive
committee
and
decide
as
to
what
should
be
done
we
ought
to
have
had
time
to
call
out
the
whole
league
instead
of
that
what
happens
while
we
all
off
chasing
rabbits
the
railroad
is
allowed
to
steal
a
march
on
us
and
when
it
is
too
late
a
handful
of
leaguers
is
got
together
and
a
fight
is
precipitated
and
our
men
killed
i
sorry
for
our
president
too
no
one
is
more
so
but
i
want
to
put
myself
on
record
as
believing
he
did
a
hasty
and
inconsiderate
thing
if
he
had
managed
right
he
could
have
had
six
hundred
men
to
oppose
the
railroad
and
there
would
not
have
been
any
gun
fight
or
any
killing
he
did
manage
right
and
there
was
a
killing
and
i
do
see
as
how
the
league
ought
to
be
held
responsible
the
idea
of
the
league
the
whole
reason
why
it
was
organised
was
to
protect
all
the
ranches
of
this
valley
from
the
railroad
and
it
looks
to
me
as
if
the
lives
of
our
had
been
sacrificed
not
in
defending
all
of
our
ranches
but
just
in
defence
of
one
of
them
los
muertos
the
one
that
derrick
the
speaker
had
no
more
than
regained
his
seat
when
a
man
was
seen
pushing
his
way
from
the
back
of
the
stage
towards
garnett
he
handed
the
rancher
a
note
at
the
same
time
whispering
in
his
ear
garnett
read
the
note
then
came
forward
to
the
edge
of
the
stage
holding
up
his
hand
when
the
audience
had
fallen
silent
he
said
i
have
just
received
sad
news
our
friend
and
osterman
died
this
morning
between
eleven
and
twelve
instantly
there
was
a
roar
every
man
in
the
building
rose
to
his
feet
shouting
gesticulating
the
roar
increased
the
opera
house
trembled
to
it
the
gas
jets
in
the
lighted
chandeliers
vibrated
to
it
it
was
a
raucous
howl
of
execration
a
bellow
of
rage
inarticulate
deafening
a
tornado
of
confusion
swept
whirling
from
wall
to
wall
and
the
madness
of
the
moment
seized
irresistibly
upon
presley
he
forgot
himself
he
no
longer
was
master
of
his
emotions
or
his
impulses
all
at
once
he
found
himself
upon
the
stage
facing
the
audience
flaming
with
excitement
his
imagination
on
fire
his
arms
uplifted
in
fierce
wild
gestures
words
leaping
to
his
mind
in
a
torrent
that
could
not
be
withheld
one
more
dead
he
cried
one
more
harran
dead
annixter
dead
broderson
dead
dabney
dead
osterman
dead
hooven
dead
shot
down
killed
killed
in
the
defence
of
their
homes
killed
in
the
defence
of
their
rights
killed
for
the
sake
of
liberty
how
long
must
it
go
on
how
long
must
we

you
have
caught
your
samson
you
have
made
his
strength
your
own
you
have
shorn
his
head
you
have
put
out
his
eyes
you
have
set
him
to
turn
your
millstones
to
grind
the
grist
for
your
mills
you
have
made
him
a
shame
and
a
mock
take

oh
as
you
love

take
care

some
day
calling
upon

lord
his

he
reach
not
out
his
arms
for
the
pillars
of
your
the
audience
at
first
bewildered
confused
by
this
unexpected
invective
suddenly
took
fire
at
his
last
words
there
was
a
roar
of
applause
then
more
significant
than
mere
vociferation
listeners
as
he
began
to
speak
again
grew
suddenly
silent
his
next
sentences
were
uttered
in
the
midst
of
a
profound
stillness
they
own
us
these
of
ours
they
own
our
homes
they
own
our
legislatures
we
can
not
escape
from
them
there
is
no
redress
we
are
told
we
can
defeat
them
by
the
they
own
the
we
are
told
that
we
must
look
to
the
courts
for
redress
they
own
the
courts
we
know
them
for
what
they
are
ruffians
in
politics
ruffians
in
finance
ruffians
in
law
ruffians
in
trade
bribers
swindlers
and
tricksters
no
outrage
too
great
to
daunt
them
no
petty
larceny
too
small
to
shame
them
despoiling
a
government
treasury
of
a
million
dollars
yet
picking
the
pockets
of
a
farm
hand
of
the
price
of
a
loaf
of
bread
they
swindle
a
nation
of
a
hundred
million
and
call
it
financiering
they
levy
a
blackmail
and
call
it
commerce
they
corrupt
a
legislature
and
call
it
politics
they
bribe
a
judge
and
call
it
law
they
hire
blacklegs
to
carry
out
their
plans
and
call
it
organisation
they
prostitute
the
honour
of
a
state
and
call
it
competition
and
this
is
america
we
fought
lexington
to
free
ourselves
we
fought
gettysburg
to
free
others
yet
the
yoke
remains
we
have
only
shifted
it
to
the
other
shoulder
we
talk
of
liberty
oh
the
farce
of
it
oh
the
folly
of
it
we
tell
ourselves
and
teach
our
children
that
we
have
achieved
liberty
that
we
no
longer
need
fight
for
it
why
the
fight
is
just
beginning
and
so
long
as
our
conception
of
liberty
remains
as
it
is
it
will
continue
for
we
conceive
of
liberty
in
the
statues
we
raise
to
her
as
a
beautiful
woman
crowned
victorious
in
bright
armour
and
white
robes
a
light
in
her
uplifted
hand
a
serene
calm
conquering
goddess
oh
the
farce
of
it
oh
the
folly
of
it
liberty
is
not
a
crowned
goddess
beautiful
in
spotless
garments
victorious
supreme
liberty
is
the
man
in
the
street
a
terrible
figure
rushing
through
powder
smoke
fouled
with
the
mud
and
ordure
of
the
gutter
bloody
rampant
brutal
yelling
curses
in
one
hand
a
smoking
rifle
in
the
other
a
blazing
torch
freedom
is
not
given
free
to
any
who
ask
liberty
is
not
born
of
the
gods
she
is
a
child
of
the
people
born
in
the
very
height
and
heat
of
battle
born
from
death
stained
with
blood
grimed
with
powder
and
she
grows
to
be
not
a
goddess
but
a
fury
a
fearful
figure
slaying
friend
and
foe
alike
raging
insatiable
merciless
the
red
presley
ceased
speaking
weak
shaking
scarcely
knowing
what
he
was
about
he
descended
from
the
stage
a
prolonged
explosion
of
applause
followed
the
opera
house
roaring
to
the
roof
men
cheering
stamping
waving
their
hats
but
it
was
not
intelligent
applause
instinctively
as
he
made
his
way
out
presley
knew
that
after
all
he
had
not
once
held
the
hearts
of
his
audience
he
had
talked
as
he
would
have
written
for
all
his
scorn
of
literature
he
had
been
literary
the
men
who
listened
to
him
ranchers
country
people
attentive
though
they
were
were
not
once
sympathetic
vaguely
they
had
felt
that
here
was
something
which
other
men
more
educated
would
possibly
consider
eloquent
they
applauded
vociferously
but
perfunctorily
in
order
to
appear
to
understand
presley
for
all
his
love
of
the
people
saw
clearly
for
one
moment
that
he
was
an
outsider
to
their
minds
he
had
not
helped
them
nor
their
cause
in
the
least
he
never
would
disappointed
bewildered
ashamed
he
made
his
way
slowly
from
the
opera
house
and
stood
on
the
steps
outside
thoughtful
his
head
bent
he
had
failed
thus
he
told
himself
in
that
moment
of
crisis
that
at
the
time
he
believed
had
been
an
inspiration
he
had
failed
the
people
would
not
consider
him
would
not
believe
that
he
could
do
them
service
then
suddenly
he
seemed
to
remember
the
resolute
set
of
his
lips
returned
once
more
pushing
his
way
through
the
crowded
streets
he
went
on
towards
the
stable
where
he
had
left
his
pony
meanwhile
in
the
opera
house
a
great
commotion
had
occurred
magnus
derrick
had
appeared
only
a
sense
of
enormous
responsibility
of
gravest
duty
could
have
prevailed
upon
magnus
to
have
left
his
house
and
the
dead
body
of
his
son
that
day
but
he
was
the
president
of
the
league
and
never
since
its
organisation
had
a
meeting
of
such
importance
as
this
one
been
held
he
had
been
in
command
at
the
irrigating
ditch
the
day
before
it
was
he
who
had
gathered
the
handful
of
leaguers
together
it
was
he
who
must
bear
the
responsibility
of
the
fight
when
he
had
entered
the
opera
house
making
his
way
down
the
central
aisle
towards
the
stage
a
loud
disturbance
had
broken
out
partly
applause
partly
a
meaningless
uproar
many
had
pressed
forward
to
shake
his
hand
but
others
were
not
found
wanting
who
formerly
his
staunch
supporters
now
scenting
opposition
in
the
air
held
back
hesitating
afraid
to
compromise
themselves
by
adhering
to
the
fortunes
of
a
man
whose
actions
might
be
discredited
by
the
very
organisation
of
which
he
was
the
head
declining
to
take
the
chair
of
presiding
officer
which
garnett
offered
him
the
governor
withdrew
to
an
angle
of
the
stage
where
he
was
joined
by
keast
this
one
still
unalterably
devoted
to
magnus
acquainted
him
briefly
with
the
tenor
of
the
speeches
that
had
been
made
i
am
ashamed
of
them
governor
he
protested
indignantly
to
lose
their
nerve
now
to
fail
you
now
it
makes
my
blood
boil
if
you
had
succeeded
yesterday
if
all
had
gone
well
do
you
think
we
would
have
heard
of
any
talk
of
of
authority
or
without
advice
and
consent
as
if
there
was
any
time
to
call
a
meeting
of
the
executive
committee
if
you
had
acted
as
you
did
the
whole
county
would
have
been
grabbed
by
the
railroad
get
up
governor
and
bring
all
up
standing
just
tear
all
to
pieces
show
that
you
are
the
head
the
boss
that
what
they
need
that
killing
yesterday
has
shaken
the
nerve
clean
out
of
for
the
instant
the
governor
was
taken
all
aback
what
his
lieutenants
were
failing
him
what
he
was
to
be
questioned
interpolated
upon
yesterday
irrepressible
conflict
had
disaffection
appeared
in
the
ranks
of
the
league
at
this
of
all
moments
he
put
from
him
his
terrible
grief
the
cause
was
in
danger
at
the
instant
he
was
the
president
of
the
league
only
the
chief
the
master
a
royal
anger
surged
within
him
a
wide
towering
scorn
of
opposition
he
would
crush
this
disaffection
in
its
incipiency
would
vindicate
himself
and
strengthen
the
cause
at
one
and
the
same
time
he
stepped
forward
and
stood
in
the
speaker
place
turning
partly
toward
the
audience
partly
toward
the
assembled
leaguers
gentlemen
of
the
league
he
began
citizens
of
bonneville
but
at
once
the
silence
in
which
the
governor
had
begun
to
speak
was
broken
by
a
shout
it
was
as
though
his
words
had
furnished
a
signal
in
a
certain
quarter
of
the
gallery
directly
opposite
a
man
arose
and
in
a
voice
partly
of
derision
partly
of
defiance
cried
out
how
about
the
bribery
of
those
two
delegates
at
sacramento
tell
us
about
that
that
what
we
want
to
hear
a
great
confusion
broke
out
the
first
cry
was
repeated
not
only
by
the
original
speaker
but
by
a
whole
group
of
which
he
was
but
a
part
others
in
the
audience
however
seeing
in
the
disturbance
only
the
clamour
of
a
few
railroad
supporters
attempted
to
howl
them
down
hissing
vigorously
and
exclaiming
put
out
put
order
order
called
garnett
pounding
with
his
gavel
the
whole
opera
house
was
in
an
uproar
but
the
interruption
of
the
governor
speech
was
evidently
not
unpremeditated
it
began
to
look
like
a
deliberate
and
planned
attack
persistently
doggedly
the
group
in
the
gallery
vociferated
tell
us
how
you
bribed
the
delegates
at
sacramento
before
you
throw
mud
at
the
railroad
let
see
if
you
are
clean
put
out
put
briber
briber
magnus
derrick
unconvicted
briber
put
him
keast
beside
himself
with
anger
pushed
down
the
aisle
underneath
where
the
recalcitrant
group
had
its
place
and
shaking
his
fist
called
up
at
them
you
were
paid
to
break
up
this
meeting
if
you
have
anything
to
say
you
will
be
afforded
the
opportunity
but
if
you
do
not
let
the
gentleman
proceed
the
police
will
be
called
upon
to
put
you
but
at
this
the
man
who
had
raised
the
first
shout
leaned
over
the
balcony
rail
and
his
face
flaming
with
wrath
shouted
yah
talk
to
me
of
your
police
look
out
we
do
call
on
them
first
to
arrest
your
president
for
bribery
you
and
your
howl
about
law
and
justice
and
corruption
here
he
turned
to
the
audience
read
about
him
read
the
story
of
how
the
sacramento
convention
was
bought
by
magnus
derrick
president
of
the
san
joaquin
league
here
the
facts
printed
and
with
the
words
he
stooped
down
and
from
under
his
seat
dragged
forth
a
great
package
of
extra
editions
of
the
bonneville
mercury
not
an
hour
off
the
presses
other
equally
large
bundles
of
the
paper
appeared
in
the
hands
of
the
surrounding
group
the
strings
were
cut
and
in
handfuls
and
armfuls
the
papers
were
flung
out
over
the
heads
of
the
audience
underneath
the
air
was
full
of
the
flutter
of
the
newly
printed
sheets
they
swarmed
over
the
rim
of
the
gallery
like
clouds
of
monstrous
winged
insects
settled
upon
the
heads
and
into
the
hands
of
the
audience
were
passed
swiftly
from
man
to
man
and
within
five
minutes
of
the
first
outbreak
every
one
in
the
opera
house
had
read
detailed
and
substantiated
account
of
magnus
derrick
deal
with
the
political
bosses
of
the
sacramento
convention
genslinger
after
pocketing
the
governor
hush
money
had
sold
him
keast
one
quiver
of
indignation
made
his
way
back
upon
the
stage
the
leaguers
were
in
wild
confusion
half
the
assembly
of
them
were
on
their
feet
bewildered
shouting
vaguely
from
proscenium
wall
to
foyer
the
opera
house
was
a
tumult
of
noise
the
gleam
of
the
thousands
of
the
mercury
extras
was
like
the
flash
of
white
caps
on
a
troubled
sea
keast
faced
the
audience
liars
he
shouted
striving
with
all
the
power
of
his
voice
to
dominate
the
clamour
liars
and
slanderers
your
paper
is
the
paid
organ
of
the
corporation
you
have
not
one
shadow
of
proof
to
back
you
up
do
you
choose
this
of
all
times
to
heap
your
calumny
upon
the
head
of
an
honourable
gentleman
already
prostrated
by
your
murder
of
his
son
proofs
we
demand
your
proofs
we
got
the
very
assemblymen
themselves
came
back
the
answering
shout
let
derrick
speak
where
is
he
hiding
if
this
is
a
lie
let
him
deny
it
let
him
disprove
the

derrick
thundered
the
opera
house
keast
wheeled
about
where
was
magnus
he
was
not
in
sight
upon
the
stage
he
had
disappeared
crowding
through
the
throng
of
leaguers
keast
got
from
off
the
stage
into
the
wings
here
the
crowd
was
no
less
dense
nearly
every
one
had
a
copy
of
the
it
was
being
read
aloud
to
groups
here
and
there
and
once
keast
overheard
the
words
say
i
wonder
if
this
is
true
after
all
well
and
even
if
it
was
cried
keast
turning
upon
the
speaker
we
should
be
the
last
ones
to
kick
in
any
case
it
was
done
for
our
benefit
it
elected
the
ranchers
a
lot
of
benefit
we
got
out
of
the
ranchers
commission
retorted
the
other
and
then
protested
a
third
speaker
that
ai
the
way
to
do
if
he
did
do
it
bribing
legislatures
why
we
were
bucking
against
corrupt
politics
we
could
afford
to
be
keast
turned
away
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
he
pushed
his
way
farther
on
at
last
opening
a
small
door
in
a
hallway
back
of
the
stage
he
came
upon
magnus
the
room
was
tiny
it
was
a
only
two
nights
before
it
had
been
used
by
the
leading
actress
of
a
comic
opera
troupe
which
had
played
for
three
nights
at
bonneville
a
tattered
sofa
and
limping
toilet
table
occupied
a
third
of
the
space
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
smell
of
stale
grease
paint
ointments
and
sachet
faded
photographs
of
young
women
in
tights
and
gauzes
ornamented
the
mirror
and
the
walls
underneath
the
sofa
was
an
old
pair
of
corsets
the
spangled
skirt
of
a
pink
dress
turned
inside
out
hung
against
the
wall
and
in
the
midst
of
such
environment
surrounded
by
an
excited
group
of
men
who
gesticulated
and
shouted
in
his
very
face
pale
alert
agitated
his
thin
lips
pressed
tightly
together
stood
magnus
derrick
here
cried
keast
as
he
entered
closing
the
door
behind
him
where
the
governor
here
magnus
i
been
looking
for
you
the
crowd
has
gone
wild
out
there
you
got
to
talk
down
come
out
there
and
give
those
blacklegs
the
lie
they
are
saying
you
are
but
before
magnus
could
reply
garnett
turned
to
keast
well
that
what
we
want
him
to
do
and
he
wo
do
yes
yes
cried
the
men
who
crowded
around
magnus
yes
that
what
we
want
him
to
keast
turned
to
magnus
why
what
all
this
governor
he
exclaimed
you
got
to
answer
that
hey
why
do
you
give
the
lie
i
i
magnus
loosened
the
collar
about
his
throat
it
is
a
lie
i
will
not
stoop
i
would
not
would
be
it
would
be
beneath
my
my
it
would
be
beneath
keast
stared
in
amazement
was
this
the
great
man
the
leader
indomitable
of
roman
integrity
of
roman
valour
before
whose
voice
whole
conventions
had
quailed
was
it
possible
he
was
afraid
to
face
those
hired
villifiers
well
how
about
this
demanded
garnett
suddenly
it
is
a
lie
it
that
commission
was
elected
honestly
was
it
how
dare
you
sir
magnus
burst
out
how
dare
you
question
me
call
me
to
account
please
understand
sir
that
i
tolerate
oh
quit
it
cried
a
voice
from
the
group
you
ca
scare
us
derrick
that
sort
of
talk
was
well
enough
once
but
it
do
go
any
more
we
want
a
yes
or
no
it
was
gone
that
power
of
mastery
that
faculty
of
command
the
ground
crumbled
beneath
his
feet
long
since
it
had
been
by
his
own
hand
undermined
authority
was
gone
why
keep
up
this
miserable
sham
any
longer
could
they
not
read
the
lie
in
his
face
in
his
voice
what
a
folly
to
maintain
the
wretched
pretence
he
had
failed
he
was
ruined
harran
was
gone
his
ranch
would
soon
go
his
money
was
gone
lyman
was
worse
than
dead
his
own
honour
had
been
prostituted
gone
gone
everything
he
held
dear
gone
lost
and
swept
away
in
that
fierce
struggle
and
suddenly
and
all
in
a
moment
the
last
remaining
shells
of
the
fabric
of
his
being
the
sham
that
had
stood
already
wonderfully
long
cracked
and
collapsed
was
the
commission
honestly
elected
insisted
garnett
were
the
delegates
did
you
bribe
the
delegates
we
were
obliged
to
shut
our
eyes
to
means
faltered
magnus
there
was
no
other
way
to
then
suddenly
and
with
the
last
dregs
of
his
resolution
he
concluded
with
yes
i
gave
them
two
thousand
dollars
oh
hell
oh
my
god
exclaimed
keast
sitting
swiftly
down
upon
the
ragged
sofa
there
was
a
long
silence
a
sense
of
poignant
embarrassment
descended
upon
those
present
no
one
knew
what
to
say
or
where
to
look
garnett
with
a
laboured
attempt
at
nonchalance
murmured
i
see
well
that
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at
yes
i
well
said
gethings
at
length
bestirring
himself
i
guess
i
go
there
was
a
movement
the
group
broke
up
the
men
making
for
the
door
one
by
one
they
went
out
the
last
to
go
was
keast
he
came
up
to
magnus
and
shook
the
governor
limp
hand
governor
he
said
i
see
you
again
pretty
soon
let
this
discourage
you
they
come
around
all
right
after
a
while
so
he
went
out
shutting
the
door
and
seated
in
the
one
chair
of
the
room
magnus
derrick
remained
a
long
time
looking
at
his
face
in
the
cracked
mirror
that
for
so
many
years
had
reflected
the
painted
faces
of
soubrettes
in
this
atmosphere
of
stale
perfume
and
mouldy
rice
powder
it
had
come
his
fall
his
ruin
after
so
many
years
of
integrity
and
honest
battle
his
life
had
ended
here
in
an
actress
deserted
by
his
friends
his
son
murdered
his
dishonesty
known
an
old
man
broken
discarded
discredited
and
abandoned
before
nightfall
of
that
day
bonneville
was
further
excited
by
an
astonishing
bit
of
news
behrman
lived
in
a
detached
house
at
some
distance
from
the
town
surrounded
by
a
grove
of
live
oak
and
eucalyptus
trees
at
a
little
after
six
as
he
was
sitting
down
to
his
supper
a
bomb
was
thrown
through
the
window
of
his
exploding
near
the
doorway
leading
into
the
hall
the
room
was
wrecked
and
nearly
every
window
of
the
house
shattered
by
a
miracle
behrman
himself
remained
untouched
chapter
viii
on
a
certain
afternoon
in
the
early
part
of
july
about
a
month
after
the
fight
at
the
irrigating
ditch
and
the
mass
meeting
at
bonneville
cedarquist
at
the
moment
opening
his
mail
in
his
office
in
san
francisco
was
genuinely
surprised
to
receive
a
visit
from
presley
well
upon
my
word
pres
exclaimed
the
manufacturer
as
the
young
man
came
in
through
the
door
that
the
office
boy
held
open
for
him
upon
my
word
have
you
been
sick
sit
down
my
boy
have
a
glass
of
sherry
i
always
keep
a
bottle
presley
accepted
the
wine
and
sank
into
the
depths
of
a
great
leather
chair
near
by
sick
he
answered
yes
i
have
been
sick
i
sick
now
i
gone
to
pieces
his
manner
was
the
extreme
of
listlessness
the
listlessness
of
great
fatigue
well
well
observed
the
other
i
right
sorry
to
hear
that
what
the
trouble
pres
oh
nerves
mostly
i
suppose
and
my
head
and
insomnia
and
weakness
a
general
collapse
all
along
the
line
the
doctor
tells
me
he
says
i
fancy
i
rather
narrowly
missed
brain
well
i
can
easily
suppose
it
answered
cedarquist
gravely
after
all
you
have
been
presley
closed
his
eyes
they
were
sunken
in
circles
of
dark
brown
flesh
and
pressed
a
thin
hand
to
the
back
of
his
head
it
is
a
nightmare
he
murmured
a
frightful
nightmare
and
it
not
over
yet
you
have
heard
of
it
all
only
through
the
newspaper
reports
but
down
there
at
bonneville
at
los
muertos
oh
you
can
have
no
idea
of
it
of
the
misery
caused
by
the
defeat
of
the
ranchers
and
by
this
decision
of
the
supreme
court
that
dispossesses
them
all
we
had
gone
on
hoping
to
the
last
that
we
would
win
there
we
had
thought
that
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
at
least
we
could
find
justice
and
the
news
of
its
decision
was
the
worst
last
blow
of
all
for
magnus
it
was
the
last
positively
the
very
poor
poor
derrick
murmured
cedarquist
tell
me
about
him
pres
how
does
he
take
it
what
is
he
going
to
do
it
beggars
him
sir
he
sunk
a
great
deal
more
than
any
of
us
believed
in
his
ranch
when
he
resolved
to
turn
off
most
of
the
tenants
and
farm
the
ranch
himself
then
the
fight
he
made
against
the
railroad
in
the
courts
and
the
political
campaign
he
went
into
to
get
lyman
on
the
railroad
commission
took
more
of
it
the
money
that
genslinger
blackmailed
him
of
it
seems
was
about
all
he
had
left
he
had
been
gambling
you
know
the
governor
on
another
bonanza
crop
this
year
to
recoup
him
well
the
bonanza
came
right
enough
just
in
time
for
behrman
and
the
railroad
to
grab
it
magnus
is
what
a
tragedy
what
a
tragedy
murmured
the
other
lyman
turning
rascal
harran
killed
and
now
this
and
all
within
so
short
a
time
all
at
the
same
time
you
might
almost
if
it
had
only
killed
him
continued
presley
but
that
is
the
worst
of
how
the
worst
i
afraid
honestly
i
afraid
it
is
going
to
turn
his
wits
sir
it
broken
him
oh
you
should
see
him
you
should
see
him
a
shambling
stooping
trembling
old
man
in
his
dotage
already
he
sits
all
day
in
the
turning
over
papers
sorting
them
tying
them
up
opening
them
again
forgetting
them
all
fumbling
and
mumbling
and
confused
and
at
table
sometimes
he
forgets
to
eat
and
listen
you
know
from
the
house
we
can
hear
the
trains
whistling
for
the
long
trestle
as
often
as
that
happens
the
governor
seems
to
be
oh
i
know
frightened
he
will
sink
his
head
between
his
shoulders
as
though
he
were
dodging
something
and
he
wo
fetch
a
long
breath
again
till
the
train
is
out
of
hearing
he
seems
to
have
conceived
an
abject
unreasoned
terror
of
the
but
he
will
have
to
leave
los
muertos
now
of
course
yes
they
will
all
have
to
leave
they
have
a
fortnight
more
the
few
tenants
that
were
still
on
los
muertos
are
leaving
that
is
one
thing
that
brings
me
to
the
city
the
family
of
one
of
the
men
who
was
killed
hooven
was
his
name
have
come
to
the
city
to
find
work
i
think
they
are
liable
to
be
in
great
distress
unless
they
have
been
wonderfully
lucky
and
i
am
trying
to
find
them
in
order
to
look
after
you
need
looking
after
yourself
oh
once
away
from
bonneville
and
the
sight
of
the
ruin
there
better
but
i
intend
to
go
away
and
that
makes
me
think
i
came
to
ask
you
if
you
could
help
me
if
you
would
let
me
take
passage
on
one
of
your
wheat
ships
the
doctor
says
an
ocean
voyage
would
set
me
why
certainly
pres
declared
cedarquist
but
i
sorry
you
have
to
go
we
expected
to
have
you
down
in
the
country
with
us
this
presley
shook
his
head
no
he
answered
i
must
go
even
if
i
had
all
my
health
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
stay
in
california
just
now
if
you
can
introduce
me
to
one
of
your
captains
with
pleasure
when
do
you
want
to
go
you
may
have
to
wait
a
few
weeks
our
first
ship
wo
clear
till
the
end
of
the
that
would
do
very
well
thank
you
but
cedarquist
was
still
interested
in
the
land
troubles
of
the
bonneville
farmers
and
took
the
first
occasion
to
ask
so
the
railroad
are
in
possession
on
most
of
the
ranches
on
all
of
them
returned
presley
the
league
went
all
to
pieces
so
soon
as
magnus
was
forced
to
resign
the
old
story
they
got
quarrelling
among
themselves
somebody
started
a
compromise
party
and
upon
that
issue
a
new
president
was
elected
then
there
were
defections
the
railroad
offered
to
lease
the
lands
in
question
to
the
ranchers
the
ranchers
who
owned
them
he
exclaimed
bitterly
and
because
the
terms
were
nominal
almost
nothing
plenty
of
the
men
took
the
chance
of
saving
themselves
and
of
course
once
signing
the
lease
they
acknowledged
the
railroad
title
but
the
road
would
not
lease
to
magnus
behrman
takes
over
los
muertos
in
a
few
weeks
no
doubt
the
road
made
over
their
title
in
the
property
to
him
observed
cedarquist
as
a
reward
of
his
no
doubt
murmured
presley
wearily
he
rose
to
go
by
the
way
said
cedarquist
what
have
you
on
hand
for
let
us
say
friday
evening
wo
you
dine
with
us
then
the
girls
are
going
to
the
country
monday
of
next
week
and
you
probably
wo
see
them
again
for
some
time
if
you
take
that
ocean
voyage
of
i
afraid
i
shall
be
very
poor
company
sir
hazarded
presley
there
no
no
life
in
me
at
all
these
days
i
am
like
a
clock
with
a
broken
not
broken
pres
my
boy
urged
the
other
only
run
down
try
and
see
if
we
ca
wind
you
up
a
bit
say
that
we
can
expect
you
we
dine
at
thank
you
sir
till
friday
at
seven
regaining
the
street
presley
sent
his
valise
to
his
club
where
he
had
engaged
a
room
by
a
messenger
boy
and
boarded
a
castro
street
car
before
leaving
bonneville
he
had
ascertained
by
strenuous
enquiry
hooven
address
in
the
city
and
thitherward
he
now
directed
his
steps
when
presley
had
told
cedarquist
that
he
was
ill
that
he
was
jaded
worn
out
he
had
only
told
half
the
truth
exhausted
he
was
nerveless
weak
but
this
apathy
was
still
invaded
from
time
to
time
with
fierce
incursions
of
a
spirit
of
unrest
and
revolt
reactions
momentary
returns
of
the
blind
undirected
energy
that
at
one
time
had
prompted
him
to
a
vast
desire
to
acquit
himself
of
some
terrible
deed
of
readjustment
just
what
he
could
not
say
some
terrifying
martyrdom
some
immolation
consummate
incisive
conclusive
he
fancied
himself
to
be
fired
with
the
purblind
mistaken
heroism
of
the
anarchist
hurling
his
victim
to
destruction
with
full
knowledge
that
the
catastrophe
shall
sweep
him
also
into
the
vortex
it
creates
but
his
constitutional
irresoluteness
obstructed
his
path
continually
weak
of
will
emotional
timid
even
he
temporised
procrastinated
brooded
came
to
decisions
in
the
dark
hours
of
the
night
only
to
abandon
them
in
the
morning
once
only
he
had
acted
and
at
this
moment
as
he
was
carried
through
the
windy
squalid
streets
he
trembled
at
the
remembrance
of
it
the
horror
of
what
might
have
been
incompatible
with
the
vengeance
whose
minister
he
fancied
he
was
oppressed
him
the
scene
perpetually
reconstructed
itself
in
his
imagination
he
saw
himself
under
the
shade
of
the
encompassing
trees
and
shrubbery
creeping
on
his
belly
toward
the
house
in
the
suburbs
of
bonneville
watching
his
chances
seizing
opportunities
spying
upon
the
lighted
windows
where
the
raised
curtains
afforded
a
view
of
the
interior
then
had
come
the
appearance
in
the
glare
of
the
gas
of
the
figure
of
the
man
for
whom
he
waited
he
saw
himself
rise
and
run
forward
he
remembered
the
feel
and
weight
in
his
hand
of
caraher
bomb
the
six
inches
of
plugged
gas
pipe
his
upraised
arm
shot
forward
there
was
a
shiver
of
smashed
then
a
void
a
red
whirl
of
confusion
the
air
rent
the
ground
rocking
himself
flung
headlong
flung
off
the
spinning
circumference
of
things
out
into
a
place
of
terror
and
vacancy
and
darkness
and
then
after
a
long
time
the
return
of
reason
the
consciousness
that
his
feet
were
set
upon
the
road
to
los
muertos
and
that
he
was
fleeing
gasping
all
but
insane
with
hysteria
then
the
night
that
ensued
when
he
descended
into
the
pit
horrified
at
what
he
supposed
he
had
done
at
one
moment
ridden
with
remorse
at
another
raging
against
his
own
feebleness
his
lack
of
courage
his
wretched
vacillating
spirit
but
morning
had
come
and
with
it
the
knowledge
that
he
had
failed
and
the
baser
assurance
that
he
was
not
even
remotely
suspected
his
own
escape
had
been
no
less
miraculous
than
that
of
his
enemy
and
he
had
fallen
on
his
knees
in
inarticulate
prayer
weeping
pouring
out
his
thanks
to
god
for
the
deliverance
from
the
gulf
to
the
very
brink
of
which
his
feet
had
been
drawn
after
this
however
there
had
come
to
presley
a
suspicion
that
he
was
of
all
human
beings
the
most
wretched
a
failure
everything
to
which
he
had
set
his
mind
failed
his
great
epic
his
efforts
to
help
the
people
who
surrounded
him
even
his
attempted
destruction
of
the
enemy
all
these
had
come
to
nothing
girding
his
shattered
strength
together
he
resolved
upon
one
last
attempt
to
live
up
to
the
best
that
was
in
him
and
to
that
end
had
set
himself
to
lift
out
of
the
despair
into
which
they
had
been
thrust
the
bereaved
family
of
the
german
hooven
after
all
was
over
and
hooven
together
with
the
seven
others
who
had
fallen
at
the
irrigating
ditch
was
buried
in
the
bonneville
cemetery
hooven
asking
no
one
aid
or
advice
and
taking
with
her
minna
and
little
hilda
had
gone
to
san
francisco
had
gone
to
find
work
abandoning
los
muertos
and
her
home
forever
presley
only
learned
of
the
departure
of
the
family
after
fifteen
days
had
elapsed
at
once
however
the
suspicion
forced
itself
upon
him
that
hooven
and
minna
too
for
the
matter
of
that
ignorant
of
city
ways
might
easily
come
to
grief
in
the
hard
huge
struggle
of
city
life
this
suspicion
had
swiftly
hardened
to
a
conviction
acting
at
last
upon
which
presley
had
followed
them
to
san
francisco
bent
upon
finding
and
assisting
them
the
house
to
which
presley
was
led
by
the
address
in
his
memorandum
book
was
a
cheap
but
fairly
decent
hotel
near
the
power
house
of
the
castro
street
cable
he
inquired
for
hooven
the
landlady
recollected
the
hoovens
perfectly
german
woman
with
a
little
and
an
older
daughter
sure
the
older
daughter
was
main
pretty
sure
i
remember
them
but
they
here
no
more
they
left
a
week
ago
i
had
to
ask
them
for
their
room
as
it
was
they
owed
a
week
mister
i
ca
afford
well
do
you
know
where
they
went
did
you
hear
what
address
they
had
their
trunk
expressed
to
ah
yes
their
trunk
vociferated
the
woman
clapping
her
hands
to
her
hips
her
face
purpling
their
trunk
ah
sure
i
got
their
trunk
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
i
holding
it
till
i
get
my
money
what
have
you
got
to
say
about
it
let
hear
presley
turned
away
with
a
gesture
of
discouragement
his
heart
sinking
on
the
street
corner
he
stood
for
a
long
time
frowning
in
trouble
and
perplexity
his
suspicions
had
been
only
too
well
founded
so
long
ago
as
a
week
the
hoovens
had
exhausted
all
their
little
store
of
money
for
seven
days
now
they
had
been
without
resources
unless
indeed
work
had
been
found
and
what
he
asked
himself
what
work
in
god
name
could
they
find
to
do
here
in
the
city
seven
days
he
quailed
at
the
thought
of
it
seven
days
without
money
knowing
not
a
soul
in
all
that
swarming
city
ignorant
of
city
life
as
both
minna
and
her
mother
were
would
they
even
realise
that
there
were
institutions
built
and
generously
endowed
for
just
such
as
they
he
knew
them
to
have
their
share
of
pride
the
dogged
sullen
pride
of
the
peasant
even
if
they
knew
of
charitable
organisations
would
they
could
they
bring
themselves
to
apply
there
a
poignant
anxiety
thrust
itself
sharply
into
presley
heart
where
were
they
now
where
had
they
slept
last
night
where
breakfasted
this
morning
had
there
even
been
any
breakfast
this
morning
had
there
even
been
any
bed
last
night
lost
and
forgotten
in
the
plexus
of
the
city
life
what
had
befallen
them
towards
what
fate
was
the
ebb
tide
of
the
streets
drifting
them
was
this
to
be
still
another
theme
wrought
out
by
iron
hands
upon
the
old
the
keynote
how
far
were
the
consequences
of
that
dreadful
day
work
at
the
irrigating
ditch
to
reach
to
what
length
was
the
tentacle
of
the
monster
to
extend
presley
returned
toward
the
central
the
business
quarter
of
the
city
alternately
formulating
and
dismissing
from
his
mind
plan
after
plan
for
the
finding
and
aiding
of
hooven
and
her
daughters
he
reached
montgomery
street
and
turned
toward
his
club
his
imagination
once
more
reviewing
all
the
causes
and
circumstances
of
the
great
battle
of
which
for
the
last
eighteen
months
he
had
been
witness
all
at
once
he
paused
his
eye
caught
by
a
sign
affixed
to
the
wall
just
inside
the
street
entrance
of
a
huge
office
building
and
smitten
with
an
idea
stood
for
an
instant
motionless
upon
the
sidewalk
his
eyes
wide
his
fists
shut
tight
the
building
contained
the
general
office
of
the
pacific
and
southwestern
railroad
large
though
it
was
it
nevertheless
was
not
pretentious
and
during
his
visits
to
the
city
presley
must
have
passed
it
unheeding
many
times
but
for
all
that
it
was
the
stronghold
of
the
enemy
the
centre
of
all
that
vast
ramifying
system
of
arteries
that
drained
the
of
the
state
the
nucleus
of
the
web
in
which
so
many
lives
so
many
fortunes
so
many
destinies
had
been
enmeshed
from
this
place
so
he
told
himself
had
emanated
that
policy
of
extortion
oppression
and
injustice
that
little
by
little
had
shouldered
the
ranchers
from
their
rights
till
their
backs
to
the
wall
exasperated
and
despairing
they
had
turned
and
fought
and
died
from
here
had
come
the
orders
to
behrman
to
cyrus
ruggles
and
to
genslinger
the
orders
that
had
brought
dyke
to
a
prison
that
had
killed
annixter
that
had
ruined
magnus
that
had
corrupted
lyman
here
was
the
keep
of
the
castle
and
here
behind
one
of
those
many
windows
in
one
of
those
many
offices
his
hand
upon
the
levers
of
his
mighty
engine
sat
the
master
shelgrim
himself
instantly
upon
the
realisation
of
this
fact
an
ungovernable
desire
seized
upon
presley
an
inordinate
curiosity
why
not
see
face
to
face
the
man
whose
power
was
so
vast
whose
will
was
so
resistless
whose
potency
for
evil
so
limitless
the
man
who
for
so
long
and
so
hopelessly
they
had
all
been
fighting
by
reputation
he
knew
him
to
be
approachable
why
should
he
not
then
approach
him
presley
took
his
resolution
in
both
hands
if
he
failed
to
act
upon
this
impulse
he
knew
he
would
never
act
at
all
his
heart
beating
his
breath
coming
short
he
entered
the
building
and
in
a
few
moments
found
himself
seated
in
an
his
eyes
fixed
with
hypnotic
intensity
upon
the
frosted
pane
of
an
adjoining
door
whereon
in
gold
letters
was
inscribed
the
word
in
the
end
presley
had
been
surprised
to
find
that
shelgrim
was
still
in
it
was
already
very
late
after
six
and
the
other
offices
in
the
building
were
in
the
act
of
closing
many
of
them
were
already
deserted
at
every
instant
through
the
open
door
of
the
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
clerks
office
boys
and
other
employees
hurrying
towards
the
stairs
and
elevators
quitting
business
for
the
day
shelgrim
it
seemed
still
remained
at
his
desk
knowing
no
fatigue
requiring
no
leisure
what
time
does
shelgrim
usually
go
home
inquired
presley
of
the
young
man
who
sat
ruling
forms
at
the
table
in
the
anywhere
between
six
and
seven
the
other
answered
adding
very
often
he
comes
back
in
the
and
the
man
was
seventy
years
old
presley
could
not
repress
a
murmur
of
astonishment
not
only
mentally
then
was
the
president
of
the
and
a
giant
seventy
years
of
age
and
still
at
his
post
holding
there
with
the
energy
with
a
concentration
of
purpose
that
would
have
wrecked
the
health
and
impaired
the
mind
of
many
men
in
the
prime
of
their
manhood
but
the
next
instant
presley
set
his
teeth
it
is
an
ogre
vitality
he
said
to
himself
just
so
is
the
tiger
strong
the
man
should
have
energy
who
has
sucked
the
from
an
entire
a
little
electric
bell
on
the
wall
near
at
hand
trilled
a
warning
the
young
man
who
was
ruling
forms
laid
down
his
pen
and
opening
the
door
of
the
president
office
thrust
in
his
head
then
after
a
word
exchanged
with
the
unseen
occupant
of
the
room
he
swung
the
door
wide
saying
to
presley
mr
shelgrim
will
see
you
presley
entered
a
large
well
lighted
but
singularly
barren
office
a
carpet
was
on
the
floor
two
steel
engravings
hung
against
the
wall
an
extra
chair
or
two
stood
near
a
large
plain
littered
table
that
was
absolutely
all
unless
he
excepted
the
corner
on
which
was
set
a
pitcher
of
ice
water
covered
with
a
clean
stiff
napkin
a
man
evidently
some
sort
of
manager
assistant
stood
at
the
end
of
the
table
leaning
on
the
back
of
one
of
the
chairs
shelgrim
himself
sat
at
the
table
he
was
large
almost
to
massiveness
an
beard
and
a
mustache
that
completely
hid
the
mouth
covered
the
lower
part
of
his
face
his
eyes
were
a
pale
blue
and
a
little
watery
here
and
there
upon
his
face
were
moth
spots
but
the
enormous
breadth
of
the
shoulders
was
what
at
first
most
vividly
forced
itself
upon
presley
notice
never
had
he
seen
a
broader
man
the
neck
however
seemed
in
a
manner
to
have
settled
into
the
shoulders
and
furthermore
they
were
humped
and
rounded
as
if
to
bear
great
responsibilities
and
great
abuse
at
the
moment
he
was
wearing
a
silk
pushed
to
one
side
and
a
little
awry
a
frock
coat
of
broadcloth
with
long
sleeves
and
a
waistcoat
from
the
lower
buttons
of
which
the
cloth
was
worn
and
upon
the
edges
rubbed
away
showing
the
metal
underneath
at
the
top
this
waistcoat
was
unbuttoned
and
in
the
shirt
front
disclosed
were
two
pearl
studs
presley
uninvited
unnoticed
apparently
sat
down
the
assistant
manager
was
in
the
act
of
making
a
report
his
voice
was
not
lowered
and
presley
heard
every
word
that
was
spoken
the
report
proved
interesting
it
concerned
a
in
the
office
of
the
auditor
of
disbursements
it
seems
he
was
at
most
times
thoroughly
reliable
industrious
ambitious
but
at
long
intervals
the
vice
of
drunkenness
seized
upon
the
man
and
for
three
days
rode
him
like
a
hag
not
only
during
the
period
of
this
intemperance
but
for
the
few
days
immediately
following
the
man
was
useless
his
work
untrustworthy
he
was
a
family
man
and
earnestly
strove
to
rid
himself
of
his
habit
he
was
when
sober
valuable
in
consideration
of
these
facts
he
had
been
pardoned
again
and
again
you
remember
shelgrim
observed
the
manager
that
you
have
more
than
once
interfered
in
his
behalf
when
we
were
disposed
to
let
him
go
i
do
think
we
can
do
anything
with
him
sir
he
promises
to
reform
continually
but
it
is
the
same
old
story
this
last
time
we
saw
nothing
of
him
for
four
days
honestly
shelgrim
i
think
we
ought
to
let
tentell
out
we
ca
afford
to
keep
him
he
is
really
losing
us
too
much
money
here
the
order
ready
now
if
you
care
to
let
it
there
was
a
pause
presley
all
attention
listened
breathlessly
the
assistant
manager
laid
before
his
president
the
typewritten
order
in
question
the
silence
lengthened
in
the
hall
outside
the
door
of
the
elevator
cage
slid
to
with
a
clash
shelgrim
did
not
look
at
the
order
he
turned
his
swivel
chair
about
and
faced
the
windows
behind
him
looking
out
with
unseeing
eyes
at
last
he
spoke
tentell
has
a
family
wife
and
three
children
how
much
do
we
pay
him
one
hundred
and
let
double
that
or
say
two
hundred
and
fifty
let
see
how
that
will
why
of
course
if
you
say
so
but
really
shelgrim
well
we
try
that
presley
had
not
time
to
readjust
his
perspective
to
this
new
point
of
view
of
the
president
of
the
and
before
the
assistant
manager
had
withdrawn
shelgrim
wrote
a
few
memoranda
on
his
calendar
pad
and
signed
a
couple
of
letters
before
turning
his
attention
to
presley
at
last
he
looked
up
and
fixed
the
young
man
with
a
direct
grave
glance
he
did
not
smile
it
was
some
time
before
he
spoke
at
last
he
said
well
presley
advanced
and
took
a
chair
nearer
at
hand
shelgrim
turned
and
from
his
desk
picked
up
and
consulted
presley
card
presley
observed
that
he
read
without
the
use
of
glasses
you
he
said
again
facing
about
you
are
the
young
man
who
wrote
the
poem
called
toilers
yes
it
seems
to
have
made
a
great
deal
of
talk
i
read
it
and
i
seen
the
picture
in
cedarquist
house
the
picture
you
took
the
idea
presley
his
senses
never
more
alive
observed
that
curiously
enough
shelgrim
did
not
move
his
body
his
arms
moved
and
his
head
but
the
great
bulk
of
the
man
remained
immobile
in
its
place
and
as
the
interview
proceeded
and
this
peculiarity
emphasised
itself
presley
began
to
conceive
the
odd
idea
that
shelgrim
had
as
it
were
placed
his
body
in
the
chair
to
rest
while
his
head
and
brain
and
hands
went
on
working
independently
a
saucer
of
shelled
filberts
stood
near
his
elbow
and
from
time
to
time
he
picked
up
one
of
these
in
a
great
thumb
and
forefinger
and
put
it
between
his
teeth
i
seen
the
picture
called
toilers
continued
shelgrim
and
of
the
two
i
like
the
picture
better
than
the
the
picture
is
by
a
master
presley
hastened
to
interpose
and
for
that
reason
said
shelgrim
it
leaves
nothing
more
to
be
said
you
might
just
as
well
have
kept
quiet
there
only
one
best
way
to
say
anything
and
what
has
made
the
picture
of
toilers
great
is
that
the
artist
said
in
it
the
best
that
could
be
said
on
the
i
had
never
looked
at
it
in
just
that
light
observed
presley
he
was
confused
all
at
sea
embarrassed
what
he
had
expected
to
find
in
shelgrim
he
could
not
have
exactly
said
but
he
had
been
prepared
to
come
upon
an
ogre
a
brute
a
terrible
man
of
blood
and
iron
and
instead
had
discovered
a
sentimentalist
and
an
art
critic
no
standards
of
measurement
in
his
mental
equipment
would
apply
to
the
actual
man
and
it
began
to
dawn
upon
him
that
possibly
it
was
not
because
these
standards
were
different
in
kind
but
that
they
were
lamentably
deficient
in
size
he
began
to
see
that
here
was
the
man
not
only
great
but
large
of
vast
sympathies
who
understood
with
equal
intelligence
the
human
nature
in
an
habitual
drunkard
the
ethics
of
a
masterpiece
of
painting
and
the
financiering
and
operation
of
ten
thousand
miles
of
railroad
i
had
never
looked
at
it
in
just
that
light
repeated
presley
there
is
a
great
deal
in
what
you
if
i
am
to
listen
continued
shelgrim
to
that
kind
of
talk
i
prefer
to
listen
to
it
first
hand
i
would
rather
listen
to
what
the
great
french
painter
has
to
say
than
to
what
you
have
to
say
about
what
he
has
already
his
speech
loud
and
emphatic
at
first
when
the
idea
of
what
he
had
to
say
was
fresh
in
his
mind
lapsed
and
lowered
itself
at
the
end
of
his
sentences
as
though
he
had
already
abandoned
and
lost
interest
in
that
thought
so
that
the
concluding
words
were
indistinct
beneath
the
grey
beard
and
mustache
also
at
times
there
was
the
faintest
suggestion
of
a
lisp
i
wrote
that
poem
hazarded
presley
at
a
time
when
i
was
terribly
upset
i
live
he
concluded
or
did
live
on
the
los
muertos
ranch
in
tulare
county
magnus
derrick
the
railroad
ranch
leased
to
derrick
observed
shelgrim
presley
spread
out
his
hands
with
a
helpless
resigned
gesture
and
continued
the
president
of
the
and
with
grave
intensity
looking
at
presley
keenly
i
suppose
you
believe
i
am
a
grand
old
i
believe
answered
presley
i
am
persuaded
he
hesitated
searching
for
his
words
believe
this
young
man
exclaimed
shelgrim
laying
a
thick
powerful
forefinger
on
the
table
to
emphasise
his
words
try
to
believe
this
to
begin
with
that
railroads
build
themselves
where
there
is
a
demand
sooner
or
later
there
will
be
a
supply
derrick
does
he
grow
his
wheat
the
wheat
grows
itself
what
does
he
count
for
does
he
supply
the
force
what
do
i
count
for
do
i
build
the
railroad
you
are
dealing
with
forces
young
man
when
you
speak
of
wheat
and
the
railroads
not
with
men
there
is
the
wheat
the
supply
it
must
be
carried
to
feed
the
people
there
is
the
demand
the
wheat
is
one
force
the
railroad
another
and
there
is
the
law
that
governs
them
supply
and
demand
men
have
only
little
to
do
in
the
whole
business
complications
may
arise
conditions
that
bear
hard
on
the
individual
crush
him
maybe
but
the
wheat
will
be
carried
to
feed
the
people
as
inevitably
as
it
will
grow
if
you
want
to
fasten
the
blame
of

regained

in
a
whirl
this

idea
this
new
conception
dumfounded
him
somehow
he
could
not
deny
it
it
rang
with
the
clear
reverberation
of
truth
was
no
one
then
to
blame
for
the
horror
at
the
irrigating
ditch
forces
conditions
laws
of
supply
and

were
these
then
the
enemies
after
all
not

there
was
no
malevolence
in
nature
colossal
indifference
only
a
vast
trend
toward
appointed
goals
nature
was
then
a
gigantic
engine
a
vast
cyclopean
power
huge
terrible
a
leviathan
with
a
heart
of
steel
knowing
no
compunction
no
forgiveness
no
tolerance
crushing
out
the
human
atom
standing
in
its
way
with
nirvanic
calm
the
agony
of
destruction
sending
never
a
jar
never
the
faintest
tremour
through
all
that
prodigious
mechanism
of
wheels
and
cogs
he
went
to
his
club
and
ate
his
supper
alone
in
gloomy
agitation
he
was
sombre
brooding
lost
in
a
dark
maze
of
gloomy
reflections
however
just
as
he
was
rising
from
the
table
an
incident
occurred
that
for
the
moment
roused
him
and
sharply
diverted
his
mind
his
table
had
been
placed
near
a
window
and
as
he
was
sipping
his
coffee
he
happened
to
glance
across
the
street
his
eye
was
at
once
caught
by
the
sight
of
a
familiar
figure
was
it
minna
hooven
the
figure
turned
the
street
corner
and
was
lost
to
sight
but
it
had
been
strangely
like
on
the
moment
presley
had
risen
from
the
table
and
clapping
on
his
hat
had
hurried
into
the
streets
where
the
lamps
were
already
beginning
to
shine
but
search
though
he
would
presley
could
not
again
come
upon
the
young
woman
in
whom
he
fancied
he
had
seen
the
daughter
of
the
unfortunate
german
at
last
he
gave
up
the
hunt
and
returning
to
his
club
at
this
hour
almost
deserted
smoked
a
few
cigarettes
vainly
attempted
to
read
from
a
volume
of
essays
in
the
library
and
at
last
nervous
distraught
exhausted
retired
to
his
bed
but
none
the
less
presley
had
not
been
mistaken
the
girl
whom
he
had
tried
to
follow
had
been
indeed
minna
hooven
when
minna
a
week
before
this
time
had
returned
to
the
lodging
house
on
castro
street
after
a
day
unsuccessful
effort
to
find
employment
and
was
told
that
her
mother
and
hilda
had
gone
she
was
struck
speechless
with
surprise
and
dismay
she
had
never
before
been
in
any
town
larger
than
bonneville
and
now
knew
not
which
way
to
turn
nor
how
to
account
for
the
disappearance
of
her
mother
and
little
hilda
that
the
landlady
was
on
the
point
of
turning
them
out
she
understood
but
it
had
been
agreed
that
the
family
should
be
allowed
to
stay
yet
one
more
day
in
the
hope
that
minna
would
find
work
of
this
she
reminded
the
but
this
latter
at
once
launched
upon
her
such
a
torrent
of
vituperation
that
the
girl
was
frightened
to
speechless
submission
oh
oh
she
faltered
i
know
i
am
sorry
i
know
we
owe
you
money
but
where
did
my
mother
go
i
only
want
to
find
oh
i
ai
going
to
be
bothered
shrilled
the
other
how
do
i
know
the
truth
of
the
matter
was
that
hooven
afraid
to
stay
in
the
vicinity
of
the
house
after
her
eviction
and
threatened
with
arrest
by
the
landlady
if
she
persisted
in
hanging
around
had
left
with
the
woman
a
note
scrawled
on
an
old
blotter
to
be
given
to
minna
when
she
returned
this
the
landlady
had
lost
to
cover
her
confusion
she
affected
a
vast
indignation
and
a
turbulent
irascible
demeanour
i
ai
going
to
be
bothered
with
such
cattle
as
you
she
vociferated
in
minna
face
i
do
know
where
your
folks
is
me
i
only
have
dealings
with
honest
people
i
ai
got
a
word
to
say
so
long
as
the
rent
is
paid
but
when
i
soldiered
out
of
a
week
lodging
then
done
you
get
right
along
now
i
do
know
you
i
ai
going
to
have

place

a
bad
name
by
having
any
south
of
market
street
chippies
hanging
around
you
get
along
or
i
call
an
minna
sought
the
street
her
head
in
a
whirl
it
was
about
five
in
her
pocket
was
cents
all
she
had
in
the
world
what
now
all
at
once
the
terror
of
the
city
that
blind
unreasoned
fear
that
only
the
outcast
knows
swooped
upon
her
and
clutched
her
by
the
throat
her
first
few
days
experience
in
the
matter
of
finding
employment
had
taught
her
just
what
she
might
expect
from
this
new
world
upon
which
she
had
been
thrown
what
was
to
become
of
her
what
was
she
to
do
where
was
she
to
go
unanswerable
grim
questions
and
now
she
no
longer
had
herself
to
fear
for
her
mother
and
the
baby
little
hilda
both
of
them
equally
unable
to
look
after
themselves
what
was
to
become
of
them
where
were
they
gone
lost
lost
all
of
them
herself
as
well
but
she
rallied
herself
as
she
walked
along
the
idea
of
her
starving
of
her
mother
and
hilda
starving
was
out
of
all
reason
of
course
it
would
not
come
to
that
of
course
not
it
was
not
thus
that
starvation
came
something
would
happen
of
course
it
would
in
time
but
meanwhile
meanwhile
how
to
get
through
this
approaching
night
and
the
next
few
days
that
was
the
thing
to
think
of
just
now
the
suddenness
of
it
all
was
what
most
unnerved
her
during
all
the
nineteen
years
of
her
life
she
had
never
known
what
it
meant
to
shift
for
herself
her
father
had
always
sufficed
for
the
family
he
had
taken
care
of
her
then
all
of
a
sudden
her
father
had
been
killed
her
mother
snatched
from
her
then
all
of
a
sudden
there
was
no
help
anywhere
then
all
of
a
sudden
a
terrible
voice
demanded
of
her
now
just
what
can
you
do
to
keep
yourself
alive
life
faced
her
she
looked
the
huge
stone
image
squarely
in
the
lustreless
eyes
it
was
nearly
twilight
minna
for
the
sake
of
avoiding
observation
for
it
seemed
to
her
that
now
a
thousand
prying
glances
followed
her
assumed
a
demeanour
and
began
to
walk
briskly
toward
the
business
quarter
of
the
town
she
was
dressed
neatly
enough
in
a
blue
cloth
skirt
with
a
blue
plush
belt
fairly
decent
shoes
once
her
mother
a
pink
shirt
waist
and
jacket
and
a
straw
sailor
she
was
in
an
unusual
fashion
pretty
even
her
troubles
had
not
dimmed
the
bright
light
of
her
pale
eyes
nor
faded
the
astonishing
redness
of
her
lips
nor
hollowed
her
strangely
white
face
her
hair
was
trim
she
carried
her
figure
erectly
even
in
her
distress
she
observed
that
men
looked
keenly
at
her
and
sometimes
after
her
as
she
went
along
but
this
she
noted
with
a
dim
faculty
the
real
minna
harassed
terrified
lashed
with
a
thousand
anxieties
kept
murmuring
under
her
breath
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
oh
what
shall
i
do
now
after
an
interminable
walk
she
gained
kearney
street
and
held
it
till
the
neighbourhood
of
the
shopping
district
gave
place
to
the
saloons
and
concert
halls
of
the
barbary
coast
she
turned
aside
in
avoidance
of
this
only
to
plunge
into
the
purlieus
of
chinatown
whence
only
she
emerged
and
out
of
breath
after
a
half
hour
of
terrors
and
at
a
time
when
it
had
grown
quite
dark
on
the
corner
of
california
and
dupont
streets
she
stood
a
long
moment
pondering
i
must
do
something
she
said
to
herself
i
must
do
she
was
tired
out
by
now
and
the
idea
occurred
to
her
to
enter
the
catholic
church
in
whose
shadow
she
stood
and
sit
down
and
rest
this
she
did
the
evening
service
was
just
being
concluded
but
long
after
the
priests
and
altar
boys
had
departed
from
the
chancel
minna
still
sat
in
the
dim
echoing
interior
confronting
her
desperate
situation
as
best
she
might
two
or
three
hours
later
the
sexton
woke
her
the
church
was
being
closed
she
must
leave
once
more
chilled
with
the
sharp
night
air
numb
with
long
sitting
in
the
same
attitude
still
oppressed
with
drowsiness
confused
frightened
minna
found
herself
on
the
pavement
she
began
to
be
hungry
and
at
length
yielding
to
the
demand
that
every
moment
grew
more
imperious
bought
and
eagerly
devoured
a
bag
of
fruit
then
once
more
she
took
up
the
round
of
walking
at
length
in
an
obscure
street
that
branched
from
kearney
street
near
the
corner
of
the
plaza
she
came
upon
an
illuminated
sign
bearing
the
inscription
beds
for
the
night
and
fifteen
cents
could
she
afford
it
it
would
leave
her
with
only
that
much
more
that
much
between
herself
and
a
state
of
privation
of
which
she
dared
not
think
and
besides
the
forbidding
look
of
the
building
frightened
her
it
was
dark
gloomy
dirty
a
place
suggestive
of
obscure
crimes
and
hidden
terrors
for
twenty
minutes
or
half
an
hour
she
hesitated
walking
twice
and
three
times
around
the
block
at
last
she
made
up
her
mind
exhaustion
such
as
she
had
never
known
weighed
like
lead
upon
her
shoulders
and
dragged
at
her
heels
she
must
sleep
she
could
not
walk
the
streets
all
night
she
entered
the
under
the
sign
and
found
her
way
up
a
filthy
flight
of
stairs
at
the
top
a
man
in
a
blue
checked
jumper
was
filling
a
lamp
behind
a
high
desk
to
him
minna
applied
i
should
like
she
faltered
to
have
a
room
a
bed
for
the
night
one
of
those
for
fifteen
cents
will
be
good
enough
i
well
this
place
is
only
for
men
said
the
man
looking
up
from
the
lamp
oh
said
minna
oh
i
i
did
she
looked
at
him
stupidly
and
he
with
equal
stupidity
returned
the
gaze
thus
for
a
long
moment
they
held
each
other
eyes
i
i
did
know
repeated
minna
yes
it
for
men
repeated
the
other
she
slowly
descended
the
stairs
and
once
more
came
out
upon
the
streets
and
upon
those
streets
that
as
the
hours
advanced
grew
more
and
more
deserted
more
and
more
silent
more
and
more
oppressive
with
the
sense
of
the
bitter
hardness
of
life
towards
those
who
have
no
means
of
living
minna
hooven
spent
the
first
night
of
her
struggle
to
keep
her
head
above
the
of
the
city
sea
into
which
she
had
been
plunged
morning
came
and
with
it
renewed
hunger
at
this
time
she
had
found
her
way
uptown
again
and
towards
ten
was
sitting
upon
a
bench
in
a
little
park
full
of
and
children
a
group
of
the
maids
drew
their
to
minna
bench
and
sat
down
continuing
a
conversation
they
had
already
begun
minna
listened
a
friend
of
one
of
the
maids
had
suddenly
thrown
up
her
position
leaving
her
madame
in
what
would
appear
to
have
been
deserved
embarrassment
oh
said
minna
breaking
in
and
lying
with
sudden
unwonted
fluency
i
am
a
i
am
out
of
a
place
do
you
think
i
could
get
that
one
the
group
turned
and
fixed
her
so
evidently
a
country
girl
with
a
supercilious
indifference
well
you
might
try
said
one
of
them
got
good
references
references
repeated
minna
blankly
she
did
not
know
what
this
meant
oh
field
ai
the
kind
to
stick
about
references
spoke
up
the
other
she
that
soft
why
anybody
could
work
i
go
there
said
minna
have
you
the
address
it
was
told
to
her
lorin
she
murmured
is
that
out
of
town
well
it
across
the
across
the
um
you
from
the
country
ai
you
yes
how
how
do
i
get
there
is
it
far
well
you
take
the
ferry
at
the
foot
of
market
street
and
then
the
train
on
the
other
side
no
it
ai
very
far
just
ask
any
one
down
there
they
tell
it
was
a
chance
but
minna
after
walking
down
to
the
ferry
slips
found
that
the
round
trip
would
cost
her
twenty
cents
if
the
journey
proved
fruitless
only
a
dime
would
stand
between
her
and
the
end
of
everything
but
it
was
a
chance
the
only
one
that
had
as
yet
presented
itself
she
made
the
trip
and
upon
the
cars
upon
the
ferryboats
on
the
locomotives
and
of
the
local
trains
she
was
reminded
of
her
father
death
and
of
the
giant
power
that
had
reduced
her
to
her
present
straits
by
the
letters
and
to
her
mind
they
occurred
everywhere
she
seemed
to
see
them
in
every
direction
she
fancied
herself
surrounded
upon
every
hand
by
the
long
arms
of
the
monster
minute
after
minute
her
hunger
gnawed
at
her
she
could
not
keep
her
mind
from
it
as
she
sat
on
the
boat
she
found
herself
curiously
scanning
the
faces
of
the
passengers
wondering
how
long
since
such
a
one
had
breakfasted
how
long
before
this
other
should
sit
down
to
lunch
when
minna
descended
from
the
train
at
lorin
on
the
other
side
of
the
bay
she
found
that
the
place
was
one
of
those
suburban
towns
not
yet
become
fashionable
such
as
may
be
seen
beyond
the
outskirts
of
any
large
american
city
all
along
the
line
of
the
railroad
thereabouts
houses
small
villas
contractors
ventures
were
scattered
the
advantages
of
suburban
lots
and
sites
for
homes
being
proclaimed
in
letters
upon
mammoth
close
to
the
right
of
way
without
much
trouble
minna
found
the
house
to
which
she
had
been
directed
a
pretty
little
cottage
set
back
from
the
street
and
shaded
by
palms
live
oaks
and
the
inevitable
eucalyptus
her
heart
warmed
at
the
sight
of
it
oh
to
find
a
little
niche
for
herself
here
a
home
a
refuge
from
those
horrible
city
streets
from
the
rat
of
famine
with
its
relentless
tooth
how
she
would
work
how
strenuously
she
would
endeavour
to
please
how
patient
of
rebuke
she
would
be
how
faithful
how
conscientious
nor
were
her
pretensions
altogether
false
upon
her
while
at
home
had
devolved
almost
continually
the
care
of
the
baby
hilda
her
little
sister
she
knew
the
wants
and
needs
of
children
her
heart
beating
her
breath
failing
she
rang
the
bell
set
squarely
in
the
middle
of
the
front
door
the
lady
of
the
house
herself
an
elderly
lady
with
pleasant
kindly
face
opened
the
door
minna
stated
her
errand
but
i
have
already
engaged
a
girl
she
said
oh
murmured
minna
striving
with
all
her
might
to
maintain
appearances
oh
i
thought
perhaps
she
turned
away
i
sorry
said
the
lady
then
she
added
would
you
care
to
look
after
so
many
as
three
little
children
and
help
around
in
light
housework
between
whiles
yes
because
my
sister
she
lives
in
north
berkeley
above
here
she
looking
far
a
girl
have
you
had
lots
of
experience
got
good
references
yes
well
i
give
you
the
address
she
lives
up
in
north
she
turned
back
into
the
house
a
moment
and
returned
handing
minna
a
card
that
where
she
lives
careful
not
to
blot
it
child
the
ink
wet
yet
you
had
better
see
is
it
far
could
i
walk
there
my
no
you
better
take
the
electric
cars
about
six
blocks
above
when
minna
arrived
in
north
berkeley
she
had
no
money
left
by
a
cruel
mistake
she
had
taken
a
car
going
in
the
wrong
direction
and
though
her
error
was
rectified
easily
enough
it
had
cost
her
her
last
piece
she
was
now
to
try
her
last
hope
promptly
it
crumbled
away
like
the
former
this
place
had
been
already
filled
and
minna
left
the
door
of
the
house
with
the
certainty
that
her
chance
had
come
to
naught
and
that
now
she
entered
into
the
last
struggle
with
life
the
death
struggle
shorn
of
her
last
pitiful
defence
her
last
safeguard
her
last
penny
as
she
once
more
resumed
her
interminable
walk
she
realised
she
was
weak
faint
and
she
knew
that
it
was
the
weakness
of
complete
exhaustion
and
the
faintness
of
approaching
starvation
was
this
the
end
coming
on
terror
of
death
aroused
her
i
must
i
must
do
something
oh
anything
i
must
have
something
to
at
this
late
hour
the
idea
of
pawning
her
little
jacket
occurred
to
her
but
now
she
was
far
away
from
the
city
and
its
pawnshops
and
there
was
no
getting
back
she
walked
on
an
hour
passed
she
lost
her
sense
of
direction
became
confused
knew
not
where
she
was
going
turned
corners
and
went
up
without
knowing
why
anything
to
keep
moving
for
she
fancied
that
so
soon
as
she
stood
still
the
rat
in
the
pit
of
her
stomach
gnawed
more
eagerly
at
last
she
entered
what
seemed
to
be
if
not
a
park
at
least
some
sort
of
public
enclosure
there
were
many
trees
the
place
was
beautiful
roads
and
walks
led
sinuously
and
invitingly
underneath
the
shade
through
the
trees
upon
the
other
side
of
a
wide
expanse
of
turf
brown
and
sear
under
the
summer
sun
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
tall
buildings
and
a
flagstaff
the
whole
place
had
a
vaguely
public
educational
appearance
and
minna
guessed
from
certain
notices
affixed
to
the
trees
warning
the
public
against
the
picking
of
flowers
that
she
had
found
her
way
into
the
grounds
of
the
state
university
she
went
on
a
little
further
the
path
she
was
following
led
her
at
length
into
a
grove
of
gigantic
live
oaks
whose
lower
branches
all
but
swept
the
ground
here
the
grass
was
green
the
few
flowers
in
bloom
the
shade
very
thick
a
more
lovely
spot
she
had
seldom
seen
near
at
hand
was
a
bench
built
around
the
trunk
of
the
largest
live
oak
and
here
at
length
weak
from
hunger
exhausted
to
the
limits
of
her
endurance
despairing
abandoned
minna
hooven
sat
down
to
enquire
of
herself
what
next
she
could
do
but
once
seated
the
demands
of
the
animal
so
she
could
believe
became
more
clamorous
more
insistent
to
eat
to
rest
to
be
safely
housed
against
another
night
above
all
else
these
were
the
things
she
craved
and
the
craving
within
her
grew
so
mighty
that
she
crisped
her
poor
starved
hands
into
little
fists
in
an
agony
of
desire
while
the
tears
ran
from
her
eyes
and
the
sobs
rose
thick
from
her
breast
and
struggled
and
strangled
in
her
aching
throat
but
in
a
few
moments
minna
was
aware
that
a
woman
apparently
of
some
thirty
years
of
age
had
twice
passed
along
the
walk
in
front
of
the
bench
where
she
sat
and
now
as
she
took
more
notice
of
her
she
remembered
that
she
had
seen
her
on
the
coming
over
from
the
city
the
woman
was
gowned
in
silk
tightly
corseted
and
wore
a
hat
of
rather
ostentatious
smartness
minna
became
convinced
that
the
person
was
watching
her
but
before
she
had
a
chance
to
act
upon
this
conviction
she
was
surprised
out
of
all
countenance
by
the
stranger
coming
up
to
where
she
sat
and
speaking
to
her
here
is
a
coincidence
exclaimed
the
as
she
sat
down
surely
you
are
the
young
girl
who
sat
opposite
me
on
the
boat
strange
i
should
come
across
you
again
i
had
you
in
mind
ever
on
this
nearer
view
minna
observed
that
the
woman
face
bore
rather
more
than
a
trace
of
enamel
and
that
the
atmosphere
about
was
impregnated
with
sachet
she
was
not
otherwise
conspicuous
but
there
was
a
certain
hardness
about
her
mouth
and
a
certain
droop
of
fatigue
in
her
eyelids
which
combined
with
an
indefinite
of
manner
held
minna
attention
do
you
know
continued
the
woman
i
believe
you
are
in
trouble
i
thought
so
when
i
saw
you
on
the
boat
and
i
think
so
now
are
you
are
you
in
trouble
you
from
the
country
ai
you
minna
glad
to
find
a
sympathiser
even
in
this
chance
acquaintance
admitted
that
she
was
in
distress
that
she
had
become
separated
from
her
mother
and
that
she
was
indeed
from
the
country
i
been
trying
to
find
a
situation
she
hazarded
in
conclusion
but
i
do
seem
to
succeed
i
never
been
in
a
city
before
except
well
it
is
a
coincidence
said
the
other
i
know
i
was
drawn
to
you
for
nothing
i
am
looking
for
just
such
a
young
girl
as
you
you
see
i
live
alone
a
good
deal
and
i
been
wanting
to
find
a
nice
bright
sociable
girl
who
will
be
a
sort
of
companion
to
me
understand
and
there
something
about
you
that
i
like
i
took
to
you
the
moment
i
saw
you
on
the
boat
now
shall
we
talk
this
over
towards
the
end
of
the
week
one
afternoon
as
presley
was
returning
from
his
club
he
came
suddenly
face
to
face
with
minna
upon
a
street
corner
ah
he
cried
coming
toward
her
joyfully
upon
my
word
i
had
almost
given
you
up
i
been
looking
everywhere
for
you
i
was
afraid
you
might
not
be
getting
along
and
i
wanted
to
see
if
there
was
anything
i
could
do
how
are
your
mother
and
hilda
where
are
you
stopping
have
you
got
a
good
place
i
do
know
where
mamma
is
answered
minna
we
got
separated
and
i
never
have
been
able
to
find
her
meanwhile
presley
had
been
taking
in
with
a
quick
eye
the
details
of
minna
silk
dress
with
its
garniture
of
lace
its
edging
of
velvet
its
silver
her
hair
was
arranged
in
a
new
way
and
on
her
head
was
a
wide
hat
with
a
flare
to
one
side
set
off
with
a
gilt
buckle
and
a
puff
of
bright
blue
plush
he
glanced
at
her
sharply
well
but
but
how
are
you
getting
on
he
demanded
minna
laughed
scornfully
i
she
cried
oh
i
gone
to
hell
it
was
either
that
or
presley
regained
his
room
at
the
club
white
and
trembling
worse
than
the
worst
he
had
feared
had
happened
he
had
not
been
soon
enough
to
help
he
had
failed
again
a
superstitious
fear
assailed
him
that
he
was
in
a
manner
marked
that
he
was
foredoomed
to
fail
minna
had
come
had
been
driven
to
this
and
he
acting
too
late
upon
his
tardy
resolve
had
not
been
able
to
prevent
it
were
the
horrors
then
never
to
end
was
the
grisly
spectre
of
consequence
to
forever
dance
in
his
vision
were
the
results
the
results
of
that
battle
at
the
irrigating
ditch
to
cross
his
path
forever
when
would
the
affair
be
terminated
the
incident
closed
where
was
that
spot
to
which
the
tentacle
of
the
monster
could
not
reach
by
now
he
was
sick
with
the
dread
of
it
all
he
wanted
to
get
away
to
be
free
from
that
endless
misery
so
that
he
might
not
see
what
he
could
no
longer
help
cowardly
he
now
knew
himself
to
be
he
thought
of
himself
only
with
loathing
bitterly
that
he
could
bring
himself
to
a
participation
in
such
trivialities
he
began
to
dress
to
keep
his
engagement
to
dine
with
the
cedarquists
he
arrived
at
the
house
nearly
half
an
hour
late
but
before
he
could
take
off
his
overcoat
cedarquist
appeared
in
the
doorway
of
the
at
the
end
of
the
hall
she
was
dressed
as
if
to
go
out
my
dear
presley
she
exclaimed
her
stout
body
bustling
toward
him
with
a
great
rustle
of
silk
i
never
was
so
glad
you
poor
dear
poet
you
are
thin
as
a
ghost
you
need
a
better
dinner
than
i
can
give
you
and
that
is
just
what
you
are
to
have
i
blundered
presley
hastened
to
exclaim
did
not
cedarquist
mention
friday
evening
no
no
no
she
cried
it
was
he
who
blundered
you
blundering
in
a
social
amenity
preposterous
no
cedarquist
forgot
that
we
were
dining
out
ourselves
and
when
he
told
me
he
had
asked
you
here
for
the
same
evening
i
fell
upon
the
man
my
dear
i
did
actually
tooth
and
nail
but
i
would
hear
of
his
wiring
you
i
just
dropped
a
note
to
our
hostess
asking
if
i
could
not
bring
you
and
when
i
told
her
who
you
were
she
received
the
idea
with
oh
empressement
so
there
it
is
all
settled
cedarquist
and
the
girls
are
gone
on
ahead
and
you
are
to
take
the
old
lady
like
a
dear
dear
poet
i
believe
i
hear
the
carriage
allons
en
voiture
once
settled
in
the
cool
gloom
of
the
coupe
odorous
of
leather
and
upholstery
cedarquist
exclaimed
and
i
never
told
you
who
you
were
to
dine
with
oh
a
personage
really
fancy
you
will
be
in
the
camp
of
your
dearest
foes
you
are
to
dine
with
the
gerard
people
one
of
the
of
your
bete
noir
the
and
presley
started
his
fists
clenching
so
abruptly
as
to
all
but
split
his
white
gloves
he
was
not
conscious
of
what
he
said
in
reply
and
cedarquist
was
so
taken
up
with
her
own
endless
stream
of
talk
that
she
did
not
observe
his
confusion
their
daughter
honora
is
going
to
europe
next
week
her
mother
is
to
take
her
and
gerard
is
to
have
just
a
few
people
to
dinner
very
informal
you
know
ourselves
you
and
oh
i
do
know
two
or
three
others
have
you
ever
seen
honora
the
prettiest
little
thing
and
will
she
be
rich
millions
i
would
not
dare
say
how
many
tiens
nous
the
coupe
drew
up
to
the
curb
and
presley
followed
cedarquist
up
the
steps
to
the
massive
doors
of
the
great
house
in
a
confused
daze
he
allowed
one
of
the
footmen
to
relieve
him
of
his
hat
and
coat
in
a
daze
he
rejoined
cedarquist
in
a
room
with
a
glass
roof
hung
with
pictures
the
art
gallery
no
doubt
and
in
a
daze
heard
their
names
announced
at
the
entrance
of
another
room
the
doors
of
which
were
hung
with
thick
blue
curtains
he
entered
collecting
his
wits
for
the
introductions
and
presentations
that
he
foresaw
impended
the
room
was
very
large
and
of
excessive
loftiness
flat
rectagonal
pillars
of
a
variegated
marble
rose
from
the
floor
almost
flush
with
the
walls
finishing
off
at
the
top
with
gilded
capitals
of
a
corinthian
design
which
supported
the
ceiling
the
ceiling
itself
instead
of
joining
the
walls
at
right
angles
curved
to
meet
them
a
device
that
produced
a
sort
of
effect
this
ceiling
was
a
maze
of
golden
involutions
in
very
high
relief
that
adjusted
themselves
to
form
a
massive
framing
for
a
great
picture
nymphs
and
goddesses
white
doves
golden
chariots
and
the
like
all
wreathed
about
with
clouds
and
garlands
of
roses
between
the
pillars
around
the
sides
of
the
room
were
hangings
of
silk
the
design
of
a
louis
quinze
type
of
beautiful
simplicity
and
faultless
taste
the
fireplace
was
a
marvel
it
reached
from
floor
to
ceiling
the
lower
parts
black
marble
carved
into
crouching
atlases
with
great
muscles
that
upbore
the
superstructure
the
design
of
this
latter
of
a
kind
of
purple
marble
shot
through
with
white
veinings
was
in
the
same
style
as
the
design
of
the
silk
hangings
in
its
midst
was
a
bronze
escutcheon
bearing
an
undecipherable
monogram
and
a
latin
motto
andirons
of
brass
nearly
six
feet
high
flanked
the
hearthstone
the
windows
of
the
room
were
heavily
draped
in
sombre
brocade
and
ecru
lace
in
which
the
initials
of
the
family
were
very
beautifully
worked
but
directly
opposite
the
fireplace
an
extra
window
lighted
from
the
adjoining
conservatory
threw
a
wonderful
rich
light
into
the
apartment
it
was
a
gothic
window
of
stained
glass
very
large
the
centre
figures
being
armed
warriors
parsifal
and
lohengrin
the
one
with
a
banner
the
other
with
a
swan
the
effect
was
exquisite
the
window
a
veritable
masterpiece
glowing
flaming
and
burning
with
a
hundred
tints
and
colours
opalescent
purple
clouded
pinks
royal
blues
saffrons
violets
so
dark
as
to
be
almost
black
under
foot
the
carpet
had
all
the
softness
of
texture
of
grass
skins
one
of
them
of
an
enormous
polar
bear
and
rugs
of
silk
velvet
were
spread
upon
the
floor
a
renaissance
cabinet
of
ebony
many
feet
taller
than
presley
head
and
inlaid
with
ivory
and
silver
occupied
one
corner
of
the
room
while
in
its
centre
stood
a
vast
table
of
flemish
oak
black
heavy
as
iron
massive
a
faint
odour
of
sandalwood
pervaded
the
air
from
the
conservatory
came
the
splashing
of
a
fountain
a
row
of
electric
bulbs
let
into
the
frieze
of
the
walls
between
the
golden
capitals
and
burning
dimly
behind
hemispheres
of
clouded
glass
threw
a
subdued
light
over
the
whole
scene
gerard
came
forward
this
is
presley
of
course
our
new
poet
of
whom
we
are
all
so
proud
i
was
so
afraid
you
would
be
unable
to
come
you
have
given
me
a
real
pleasure
in
allowing
me
to
welcome
you
the
footman
appeared
at
her
elbow
dinner
is
served
madame
he
announced
when
hooven
had
left
the
on
castro
street
she
had
taken
up
a
position
on
a
neighbouring
corner
to
wait
for
reappearance
little
hilda
at
this
time
hardly
more
than
six
years
of
age
was
with
her
holding
to
her
hand
hooven
was
by
no
means
an
old
woman
but
hard
work
had
aged
her
she
no
longer
had
any
claim
to
good
looks
she
no
longer
took
much
interest
in
her
personal
appearance
at
the
time
of
her
eviction
from
the
castro
street
she
wore
a
faded
black
bonnet
garnished
with
faded
artificial
flowers
of
dirty
pink
a
plaid
shawl
was
about
her
shoulders
but
this
day
of
misfortune
had
set
hooven
adrift
in
even
worse
condition
than
her
daughter
her
purse
containing
a
miserable
handful
of
dimes
and
nickels
was
in
her
trunk
and
her
trunk
was
in
the
hands
of
the
landlady
minna
had
been
allowed
such
reprieve
as
her
cents
would
purchase
the
destitution
of
hooven
and
her
little
girl
had
begun
from
the
very
moment
of
her
eviction
while
she
waited
for
minna
watching
every
street
car
and
every
approaching
pedestrian
a
policeman
appeared
asked
what
she
did
and
receiving
no
satisfactory
reply
promptly
moved
her
on
minna
had
had
little
assurance
in
facing
the
life
struggle
of
the
city
hooven
had
absolutely
none
in
her
grief
distress
the
pinch
of
poverty
and
above
all
the
nameless
fear
of
the
turbulent
fierce
life
of
the
streets
had
produced
a
numbness
an
embruted
sodden
silent
speechless
condition
of
dazed
mind
and
clogged
unintelligent
speech
she
was
dumb
bewildered
stupid
animated
but
by
a
single
impulse
she
clung
to
life
and
to
the
life
of
her
little
daughter
hilda
with
the
blind
tenacity
of
purpose
of
a
drowning
cat
thus
when
ordered
to
move
on
by
the
officer
she
had
silently
obeyed
not
even
attempting
to
explain
her
situation
she
walked
away
to
the
next
then
in
a
few
moments
returned
taking
up
her
place
on
the
corner
near
the
spying
upon
the
approaching
cable
cars
peeping
anxiously
down
the
length
of
the
sidewalks
once
more
the
officer
ordered
her
away
and
once
more
unprotesting
she
complied
but
when
for
the
third
time
the
policeman
found
her
on
the
forbidden
spot
he
had
lost
his
temper
this
time
when
hooven
departed
he
had
followed
her
and
when
bewildered
persistent
she
had
attempted
to
turn
back
he
caught
her
by
the
shoulder
do
you
want
to
get
arrested
hey
he
demanded
do
you
want
me
to
lock
you
up
say
do
you
speak
up
the
ominous
words
at
length
reached
hooven
comprehension
arrested
she
was
to
be
arrested
the
countrywoman
fear
of
the
jail
nipped
and
bit
eagerly
at
her
unwilling
heels
she
hurried
off
thinking
to
return
to
her
post
after
the
policeman
should
have
gone
away
but
when
at
length
turning
back
she
tried
to
find
the
she
suddenly
discovered
that
she
was
on
an
unfamiliar
street
unwittingly
no
doubt
she
had
turned
a
corner
she
could
not
retrace
her
steps
she
and
hilda
were
lost
mammy
i
tired
hilda
complained
her
mother
picked
her
up
mammy
where
we
gowun
mammy
where
indeed
stupefied
hooven
looked
about
her
at
the
endless
blocks
of
buildings
the
endless
procession
of
vehicles
in
the
streets
the
endless
march
of
pedestrians
on
the
sidewalks
where
was
minna
where
was
she
and
her
baby
to
sleep
that
night
how
was
hilda
to
be
fed
she
could
not
stand
still
there
was
no
place
to
sit
down
but
one
thing
was
left
walk
ah
that
via
dolorosa
of
the
destitute
that
chemin
de
la
croix
of
the
homeless
ah
the
mile
after
mile
of
granite
pavement
that
must
be
must
be
traversed
walk
they
must
move
they
must
onward
forward
whither
they
can
not
tell
why
they
do
not
know
walk
walk
walk
with
bleeding
feet
and
smarting
joints
walk
with
aching
back
and
trembling
knees
walk
though
the
senses
grow
giddy
with
fatigue
though
the
eyes
droop
with
sleep
though
every
nerve
demanding
rest
sets
in
motion
its
tiny
alarm
of
pain
death
is
at
the
end
of
that
devious
winding
maze
of
paths
crossed
and
and
crossed
again
there
is
but
one
goal
to
the
via
dolorosa
there
is
no
escape
from
the
central
chamber
of
that
labyrinth
fate
guides
the
feet
of
them
that
are
set
therein
double
on
their
steps
though
they
may
weave
in
and
out
of
the
myriad
corners
of
the
city
streets
return
go
forward
back
from
side
to
side
here
there
anywhere
dodge

the
central
chamber
where
death
sits
is
reached
inexorably
at
the
end
sometimes
leading
and
sometimes
carrying
hilda
hooven
set
off
upon
her
objectless
journey
block
after
block
she
walked
street
after
street
she
was
afraid
to
stop
because
of
the
policemen
as
often
as
she
so
much
as
slackened
her
pace
she
was
sure
to
see
one
of
these
terrible
figures
in
the
distance
watching
her
so
it
seemed
to
her
waiting
for
her
to
halt
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
in
order
that
he
might
have
an
excuse
to
arrest
her
hilda
fretted
incessantly
mammy
where
we
gowun
mammy
i
then
at
last
for
the
first
time
that
plaint
that
stabbed
the
mother
heart
mammy
i
be
den
said
hooven
bretty
soon
we
hev
der
on
the
sidewalk
men
and
women
in
the
great
six
homeward
march
jostled
them
as
they
went
along
with
dumb
dull
curiousness
she
looked
into
one
after
another
of
the
limitless
stream
of
faces
and
she
fancied
she
saw
in
them
every
emotion
but
pity
the
faces
were
gay
were
anxious
were
sorrowful
were
mirthful
were
lined
with
thought
or
were
merely
flat
and
expressionless
but
not
one
was
turned
toward
her
in
compassion
the
expressions
of
the
faces
might
be
various
but
an
underlying
callousness
was
discoverable
beneath
every
mask
the
people
seemed
removed
from
her
immeasurably
they
were
infinitely
above
her
what
was
she
to
them
she
and
her
baby
the
crippled
outcasts
of
the
human
herd
the
unfit
not
able
to
survive
thrust
out
on
the
heath
to
perish
to
beg
from
these
people
did
not
yet
occur
to
her
there
was
no
pride
however
in
the
matter
she
would
have
as
readily
asked
alms
of
so
many
sphinxes
she
went
on
without
willing
it
her
feet
carried
her
in
a
wide
circle
soon
she
began
to
recognise
the
houses
she
had
been
in
that
street
before
somehow
this
was
distasteful
to
her
so
striking
off
at
right
angles
she
walked
straight
before
her
for
over
a
dozen
blocks
by
now
it
was
growing
darker
the
sun
had
set
the
hands
of
a
clock
on
the
of
a
cable
line
pointed
to
seven
no
doubt
minna
had
come
long
before
this
time
had
found
her
mother
gone
and
had
just
what
had
she
done
just
what
could
she
do
where
was
her
daughter
now
walking
the
streets
herself
no
doubt
what
was
to
become
of
minna
pretty
girl
that
she
was
lost
houseless
and
friendless
in
the
maze
of
these
streets
hooven
roused
from
her
lethargy
could
not
repress
an
exclamation
of
anguish
here
was
misfortune
indeed
here
was
calamity
she
bestirred
herself
and
remembered
the
address
of
the
she
might
inquire
her
way
back
thither
no
doubt
by
now
the
policeman
would
be
gone
home
for
the
night
she
looked
about
she
was
in
the
district
of
modest
residences
and
a
young
man
was
coming
toward
her
carrying
a
new
garden
hose
looped
around
his
shoulder
say
say
blease
the
young
man
gave
her
a
quick
look
and
passed
on
hitching
the
coil
of
hose
over
his
shoulder
but
a
few
paces
distant
he
slackened
in
his
walk
and
fumbled
in
his
vest
pocket
with
his
fingers
then
he
came
back
to
hooven
and
put
a
quarter
into
her
hand
hooven
stared
at
the
coin
stupefied
the
young
man
disappeared
he
thought
then
that
she
was
begging
it
had
come
to
that
she
independent
all
her
life
whose
husband
had
held
five
hundred
acres
of
wheat
land
had
been
taken
for
a
beggar
a
flush
of
shame
shot
to
her
face
she
was
about
to
throw
the
money
after
its
giver
but
at
the
moment
hilda
again
exclaimed
mammy
i
with
a
movement
of
infinite
lassitude
and
resigned
acceptance
of
the
situation
hooven
put
the
coin
in
her
pocket
she
had
no
right
to
be
proud
any
longer
hilda
must
have
food
that
evening
she
and
her
child
had
supper
at
a
cheap
restaurant
in
a
poor
quarter
of
the
town
and
passed
the
night
on
the
benches
of
a
little
uptown
park
unused
to
the
ways
of
the
town
ignorant
as
to
the
customs
and
possibilities
of
she
spent
the
whole
of
her
quarter
upon
supper
for
herself
and
hilda
and
had
nothing
left
wherewith
to
buy
a
lodging
the
night
was
dreadful
hilda
sobbed
herself
to
sleep
on
her
shoulder
waking
thereafter
from
hour
to
hour
to
protest
though
wrapped
in
her
mother
shawl
that
she
was
cold
and
to
enquire
why
they
did
not
go
to
bed
drunken
men
snored
and
sprawled
near
at
hand
towards
morning
a
loafer
reeking
of
alcohol
sat
down
beside
her
and
indulged
in
an
incoherent
soliloquy
punctuated
with
oaths
and
obscenities
it
was
not
till
far
along
towards
daylight
that
she
fell
asleep
she
awoke
to
find
it
broad
day
hilda
mercifully
slept
her
limbs
were
stiff
and
lame
with
cold
and
damp
her
head
throbbed
she
moved
to
another
bench
which
stood
in
the
rays
of
the
sun
and
for
a
long
two
hours
sat
there
in
the
thin
warmth
till
the
moisture
of
the
night
that
clung
to
her
clothes
was
evaporated
a
policeman
came
into
view
she
woke
hilda
and
carrying
her
in
her
arms
took
herself
away
mammy
began
hilda
as
soon
as
she
was
well
awake
mammy
i
hungry
i
want
mein
sure
sure
soon
now
leedle
she
herself
was
hungry
but
she
had
but
little
thought
of
that
how
was
hilda
to
be
fed
she
remembered
her
experience
of
the
previous
day
when
the
young
man
with
the
hose
had
given
her
money
was
it
so
easy
then
to
beg
could
charity
be
had
for
the
asking
so
it
seemed
but
all
that
was
left
of
her
sturdy
independence
revolted
at
the
thought
she
beg
she
hold
out
the
hand
to
strangers
mammy
i
there
was
no
other
way
it
must
come
to
that
in
the
end
why
temporise
why
put
off
the
inevitable
she
sought
out
a
frequented
street
where
men
and
women
were
on
their
way
to
work
one
after
another
she
let
them
go
by
searching
their
faces
deterred
at
the
very
last
moment
by
some
trifling
variation
of
expression
a
firm
set
mouth
a
serious
level
eyebrow
an
advancing
chin
then
twice
when
she
had
made
a
choice
and
brought
her
resolution
to
the
point
of
speech
she
quailed
shrinking
her
ears
tingling
her
whole
being
protesting
against
the
degradation
every
one
must
be
looking
at
her
her
shame
was
no
doubt
the
object
of
an
hundred
eyes
mammy
i
hungry
protested
hilda
again
she
made
up
her
mind
what
though
was
she
to
say
in
what
words
did
beggars
ask
for
assistance
she
tried
to
remember
how
tramps
who
had
appeared
at
her
back
door
on
los
muertos
had
addressed
her
how
and
with
what
formula
certain
mendicants
of
bonneville
had
appealed
to
her
then
having
settled
upon
a
phrase
she
approached
a
whiskered
gentleman
with
a
large
stomach
walking
briskly
in
the
direction
of
the
town
say
den
blease
hellup
a
boor
the
gentleman
passed
on
perhaps
he
doand
hear
me
she
murmured
two
women
advanced
chattering
gayly
say
say
den
blease
hellup
a
boor
one
of
the
women
paused
murmuring
to
her
companion
and
from
her
purse
extracted
a
yellow
ticket
which
she
gave
to
hooven
with
voluble
explanations
but
hooven
was
confused
she
did
not
understand
what
could
the
ticket
mean
the
women
went
on
their
way
the
next
person
to
whom
she
applied
was
a
young
girl
of
about
eighteen
very
prettily
dressed
say
say
den
blease
hellup
a
boor
in
evident
embarrassment
the
young
girl
paused
and
searched
in
her
little
pocketbook
i
think
i
have
i
think
i
have
just
ten
cents
here
somewhere
she
murmured
again
and
again
in
the
end
she
found
a
dime
and
dropped
it
into
hooven
palm
that
was
the
beginning
the
first
step
once
taken
the
others
became
easy
all
day
long
hooven
and
hilda
followed
the
streets
begging
begging
here
it
was
a
nickel
there
a
dime
here
a
nickel
again
but
she
was
not
expert
in
the
art
nor
did
she
know
where
to
buy
food
the
cheapest
and
the
entire
day
work
resulted
only
in
barely
enough
for
two
meals
of
bread
milk
and
a
wretchedly
cooked
stew
tuesday
night
found
the
pair
once
more
shelterless
once
more
hooven
and
her
baby
passed
the
night
on
the
park
benches
but
early
on
wednesday
morning
hooven
found
herself
assailed
by
sharp
pains
and
cramps
in
her
stomach
what
was
the
cause
she
could
not
say
but
as
the
day
went
on
the
pains
increased
alternating
with
hot
flushes
over
all
her
body
and
a
certain
weakness
and
faintness
as
the
day
went
on
the
pain
and
the
weakness
increased
when
she
tried
to
walk
she
found
she
could
do
so
only
with
the
greatest
difficulty
here
was
fresh
misfortune
to
beg
she
must
walk
dragging
herself
forward
a
at
a
time
she
regained
the
street
once
more
she
succeeded
in
begging
a
couple
of
nickels
bought
a
bag
of
apples
from
a
vender
and
returning
to
the
park
sank
exhausted
upon
a
bench
here
she
remained
all
day
until
evening
hilda
alternately
whimpering
for
her
bread
and
milk
or
playing
languidly
in
the
gravel
walk
at
her
feet
in
the
evening
she
started
out
again
this
time
it
was
bitter
hard
nobody
seemed
inclined
to
give
twice
she
was
moved
on
by
policemen
two
hours
begging
elicited
but
a
single
dime
with
this
she
bought
hilda
bread
and
milk
and
refusing
herself
to
eat
returned
to
the
bench
the
only
home
she
knew
and
spent
the
night
shivering
with
cold
burning
with
fever
from
wednesday
morning
till
friday
evening
with
the
exception
of
the
few
apples
she
had
bought
and
a
quarter
of
a
loaf
of
hard
bread
that
she
found
in
a
greasy
newspaper
scraps
of
a
workman
dinner
hooven
had
nothing
to
eat
in
her
weakened
condition
begging
became
hourly
more
difficult
and
such
little
money
as
was
given
her
she
resolutely
spent
on
hilda
bread
and
milk
in
the
morning
and
evening
by
friday
afternoon
she
was
very
weak
indeed
her
eyes
troubled
her
she
could
no
longer
see
distinctly
and
at
times
there
appeared
to
her
curious
figures
huge
crystal
goblets
of
the
most
graceful
shapes
floating
and
swaying
in
the
air
in
front
of
her
almost
within
reach
vases
of
elegant
forms
made
of
shimmering
glass
bowed
and
courtesied
toward
her
glass
bulbs
took
graceful
and
varying
shapes
before
her
vision
now
rounding
into
globes
now
evolving
into
now
twisting
into
convolutions
mammy
i
hungry
insisted

her

over
her
face

started
and
woke
it
was
friday

lit

she
said
rising
and
taking
hilda
hand
gome

we
go
vind
subber
hey
she
issued
from
the
park
and
took
a
cross
street
directly
away
from
the
locality
where
she
had
begged
the
previous
days
she
had
had
no
success
there
of
late
she
would
try
some
other
quarter
of
the
town
after
a
weary
walk
she
came
out
upon
van
ness
avenue
near
its
junction
with
market
street
she
turned
into
the
avenue
and
went
on
toward
the
bay
painfully
traversing
block
after
block
begging
of
all
whom
she
met
for
she
no
longer
made
any
distinction
among
the
say

mammy
i
it
was
friday
night
between
seven
and
eight
the
great
deserted
avenue
was
already
dark
a
sea
fog
was
scudding
overhead
and
by
degrees
descending
lower
the
warmth
was
of
the
meagerest
and
the
street
lamps
birds
of
fire
in
cages
of
glass
fluttered
and
danced
in
the
prolonged
gusts
of
the
trade
wind
that
threshed
and
weltered
in
the
city
streets
from
off
the
ocean

the
of
the

mansion
with

on
his

languid
young

was
superb
in
its
appointments
on
three
sides
of
the
room
to
the
height
of
some
ten
feet
ran
a
continuous
picture
an
oil
painting
divided
into
long
sections
by
narrow
panels
of
black
oak
the
painting
represented
the
personages
in
the
romaunt
de
la
rose
and
was
conceived
in
an
atmosphere
of
the
most
delicate
most
ephemeral
allegory
one
saw
young
chevaliers
of
elemental
beauty
and
purity
women
with
crowns
gold
girdles
and
cloudy
wimples
young
girls
entrancing
in
their
loveliness
wearing
kerchiefs
their
golden
hair
unbound
and
flowing
dressed
in
white
samite
bearing
armfuls
of
flowers
the
whole
procession
defiling
against
a
background
of
forest
glades
venerable
oaks
fountains
and
fields
of
asphodel
and
roses
otherwise
the
room
was
simple
against
the
side
of
the
wall
unoccupied
by
the
picture
stood
a
sideboard
of
gigantic
size
that
once
had
adorned
the
banquet
hall
of
an
italian
palace
of
the
late
renaissance
it
was
black
with
age
and
against
its
sombre
surfaces
glittered
an
array
of
heavy
silver
dishes
and
heavier
bowls
and
goblets
the
company
sat
down
to
the
first
course
of
raw
blue
point
oysters
served
upon
little
pyramids
of
shaved
ice
and
the
two
butlers
at
once
began
filling
the
glasses
of
the
guests
with
cool
haut
sauterne
gerard
who
was
very
proud
of
her
dinners
and
never
able
to
resist
the
temptation
of
commenting
upon
them
to
her
guests
leaned
across
to
presley
and
cedarquist
murmuring
mr
presley
do
you
find
that
sauterne
too
cold
i
always
believe
it
is
so
bourgeois
to
keep
such
a
delicate
wine
as
sauterne
on
the
ice
and
to
ice
bordeaux
or
burgundy
oh
it
is
nothing
short
of
a
this
is
from
your
own
vineyard
is
it
not
asked
julian
lambert
i
think
i
recognise
the
he
strove
to
maintain
an
attitude
of
fin
gourmet
unable
to
refrain
from
comment
upon
the
courses
as
they
succeeded
one
another
little
honora
gerard
turned
to
presley
you
know
she
explained
papa
has
his
own
vineyards
in
southern
france
he
is
so
particular
about
his
wines
turns
up
his
nose
at

i
am
to
go

next
summer
ferrieres

the
name
of
the
place
where
our
vineyards
are
the
dearest

she
was
a
beautiful
little
girl
of
a
dainty
porcelain
type
her
colouring
low
in
tone
she
wore
no
jewels
but
her
little
undeveloped
neck
and
shoulders
of
an
exquisite
immaturity
rose
from
the
tulle
bodice
of
her
first
decollete
gown
yes
she
continued
i
to
go
to
europe
for
the
first
time
wo

the
tyrol
wo

presley
assented
in
meaningless
words
he
sipped
his
wine
mechanically
looking
about
that
marvellous
room
with
its
subdued
saffron
lights
its
glitter
of
glass
and
silver
its
beautiful
women
in
their
elaborate
toilets
its
deft
correct
servants
its
array
of
tableware
cut
glass
chased
silver
and
dresden
crockery
it
was
wealth
in
all
its
outward
and
visible
forms
the
signs
of
an
opulence
so
great
that
it
need
never
be
husbanded
it
was
the
home
of
a
railway
magnate
a
railroad
king
for
this
then
the
farmers
paid

was
for
this

at

with
a

made
of
browned

and
thin
slices
of

caused

crossed
the
avenue
it
was
growing
late
without
knowing
it
she
had
come
to
a
part
of
the
city
that
experienced
beggars
shunned
there
was
nobody
about
block
after
block
of
residences
stretched
away
on
either
hand
lighted
full
of
people
but
the
sidewalks
were
deserted
mammy
whimpered
hilda
i
tired
carry
using
all
her
strength
hooven
picked
her
up
and
moved
on
aimlessly
then
again
that
terrible
cry
the
cry
of
the
hungry
child
appealing
to
the
helpless
mother
mammy
i
ach

exclaimed
hooven
holding
her
close
to

she
went
on
holding
hilda
against
her
shoulder
with
one
arm
as
best
she
might
one
hand
steadying
herself
against
the
fence
railings
along
the
sidewalk
at
last
a
solitary
pedestrian
came
into
view
a
young
man
in
a
top
hat
and
overcoat
walking
rapidly
hooven
held
out
a
quivering
hand
as
he
passed
her
say
say
den
blease
hellup
a
boor
the
other
hurried
on
the
fish
course
was
grenadins
of
bass
and
small
salmon
the
latter
stuffed
and
cooked
in
white
wine
and
mushroom
liquor
i
have
read
your
poem
of
course
presley
observed
gerard
toilers
i
mean
what
a
sermon
you
read
us
you
dreadful
young
man
i
felt
that
i
ought
at
once
to
all
that
i
have
and
give
to
the
poor
positively
it
did
stir
me
up
you
may
congratulate
yourself
upon
making
at
least
one
convert
just
because
of
that
poem
cedarquist
and
i
have
started
a
movement
to
send
a
whole
shipload
of
wheat
to
the
starving
people
in
india
now
you
horrid
reactionnaire
are
you
satisfied
i
am
very
glad
murmured
presley
but
i
am
afraid
observed
cedarquist
that
we
may
be
too
late
they
are
dying
so
fast
those
poor
people
by
the
time
our
ship
reaches
india
the
famine
may
be
all
one
need
never
be
afraid
of
being
late
in
the
matter
of
helping
the
destitute
answered
presley
unfortunately
they
are
always
a
fixed
quantity
poor
ye
have
always
with
you
how
very
clever
that
is
said
gerard
cedarquist
tapped
the
table
with
her
fan
in
mild
applause
brilliant
brilliant
she
murmured
honora
said
gerard
turning
to
her
daughter
at
that
moment
in
conversation
with
the
languid
lambert
honora
ma
cherie
de
notre
jeune
hooven
went
on
stumbling
from
street
to
street
holding
hilda
to
her
breast
famine
gnawed
incessantly
at
her
stomach
walk
though
she
might
turn
upon
her
tracks
up
and
down
the
streets
back
to
the
avenue
again
incessantly
and
relentlessly
the
torture
dug
into
her
vitals
she
was
hungry
hungry
and
if
the
want
of
food
harassed
and
rended
her
woman
that
she
was
what
must
it
be
in
the
poor
starved
stomach
of
her
little
girl
oh
for
some
helping
hand
now
oh
for
one
little
mouthful
one
little
nibble
food
food
all
her
wrecked
body
clamoured
for
nourishment
anything
to
numb
those
gnawing
teeth
an
abandoned
loaf
hard
mouldered
a
fruit
yes
even
the
refuse
of
the
gutter
even
the
garbage
of
the
ash
heap
on
she
went
peering
into
dark
corners
into
the
areaways
anywhere
everywhere
watching
the
silent
prowling
of
cats
the
intent
rovings
of
stray
dogs
but
she
was
growing
weaker
the
pains
and
cramps
in
her
stomach
returned
hilda
weight
bore
her
to
the
pavement
more
than
once
a
great
giddiness
a
certain
wheeling
faintness
all
but
overcame
her
hilda
however
was
asleep
to
wake
her
would
only
mean
to
revive
her
to
the
consciousness
of
hunger
yet
how
to
carry
her
further
hooven
began
to
fear
that
she
would
fall
with
her
child
in
her
arms
the
terror
of
a
collapse
upon
those
cold
pavements
glistening
with
roused
her
she
must
make
an
effort
to
get
through
the
night
she
rallied
all
her
strength
and
pausing
a
moment
to
shift
the
weight
of
her
baby
to
the
other
arm
once
more
set
off
through
the
night
a
little
while
later
she
found
on
the
edge
of
the
sidewalk
the
peeling
of
a
banana
it
had
been
trodden
upon
and
it
was
muddy
but
joyfully
she
caught
it
up
hilda
she
cried
wake
oop
leedle
girl
see
loog
den
somedings
to

look
den
hey
dat
goot
ai

zum
but
it
could
not
be
eaten
decayed
dirty
all
but
rotting
the
stomach
turned
from
the
refuse
nauseated
no
no
cried
hilda
that
not
good
i
ca
eat
it
oh
mammy
please
gif
me
those
by
now
the
guests
of
gerard
had
come
to
the
entrees
londonderry
pheasants
escallops
of
duck
and
rissolettes
a
la
pompadour
the
wine
was
chateau
latour
all
around
the
table
conversations
were
going
forward
gayly
the
good
wines
had
broken
up
the
slight
restraint
of
the
early
part
of
the
evening
and
a
spirit
of
good
humour
and
good
fellowship
prevailed
young
lambert
and
gerard
were
deep
in
reminiscences
of
certain
mutual
expeditions
gerard
and
cedarquist
discussed
a
novel
a
strange
mingling
of
psychology
degeneracy
and
analysis
of
erotic
conditions
which
had
just
been
translated
from
the
italian
stephen
lambert
and
beatrice
disputed
over
the
merits
of
a
scotch
collie
just
given
to
the
young
lady
the
scene
was
gay
the
electric
bulbs
sparkled
the
wine
flashing
back
the
light
the
entire
table
was
a
vague
glow
of
white
napery
delicate
china
and
glass
as
brilliant
as
crystal
behind
the
guests
the
came
and
went
filling
the
glasses
continually
changing
the
covers
serving
the
entrees
managing
the
dinner
without
interruption
confusion
or
the
slightest
unnecessary
noise
but
presley
could
find
no
enjoyment
in
the
occasion
from
that
picture
of
feasting
that
scene
of
luxury
that
atmosphere
of
decorous
refinement
his
thoughts
went
back
to
los
muertos
and
quien
sabe
and
the
irrigating
ditch
at
hooven
he
saw
them
fall
one
by
one
harran
annixter
osterman
broderson
hooven
the
clink
of
the
wine
glasses
was
drowned
in
the
explosion
of
revolvers
the
railroad
might
indeed
be
a
force
only
which
no
man
could
control
and
for
which
no
man
was
responsible
but
his
friends
had
been
killed
but
years
of
extortion
and
oppression
had
wrung
money
from
all
the
san
joaquin
money
that
had
made
possible
this
very
scene
in
which
he
found
himself
because
magnus
had
been
beggared
gerard
had
become
railroad
king
because
the
farmers
of
the
valley
were
poor
these
men
were
rich
the
fancy
grew
big
in
his
mind
distorted
caricatured
terrible
because
the
farmers
had
been
killed
at
the
irrigation
ditch
these
others
gerard
and
his
family
fed
full
they
fattened
on
the
blood
of
the
people
on
the
blood
of
the
men
who
had
been
killed
at
the
ditch
it
was
a
dog
eat
dog
an
unspeakable
cannibalism
harran
annixter
and
hooven
were
being
devoured
there
under
his
eyes
these
dainty
women
his
cousin
beatrice
and
little
miss
gerard
frail
delicate
all
these
fine
ladies
with
their
small
fingers
and
slender
necks
suddenly
were
transfigured
in
his
tortured
mind
into
harpies
tearing
human
flesh
his
head
swam
with
the
horror
of
it
the
terror
of
it
yes
the
people
would
turn
some
day
and
turning
rend
those
who
now
preyed
upon
them
it
would
be
dog
eat
dog
again
with
positions
reversed
and
he
saw
for
one
instant
of
time
that
splendid
house
sacked
to
its
foundations
the
tables
overturned
the
pictures
torn
the
hangings
blazing
and
liberty
the
man
in
the
street
grimed
with
powder
smoke
foul
with
the
gutter
rush
yelling
torch
in
hand
through
every
door
at
ten
hooven
fell
luckily
she
was
leading
hilda
by
the
hand
at
the
time
and
the
little
girl
was
not
hurt
in
vain
had
hooven
hour
after
hour
walked
the
streets
after
a
while
she
no
longer
made
any
attempt
to
beg
nobody
was
stirring
nor
did
she
even
try
to
hunt
for
food
with
the
stray
dogs
and
cats
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
return
to
the
park
in
order
to
sit
upon
the
benches
there
but
she
had
mistaken
the
direction
and
following
up
sacramento
street
had
come
out
at
length
not
upon
the
park
but
upon
a
great
vacant
lot
at
the
very
top
of
the
clay
street
hill
the
ground
was
unfenced
and
rose
above
her
to
form
the
cap
of
the
hill
all
overgrown
with
bushes
and
a
few
stunted
live
oaks
it
was
in
trying
to
cross
this
piece
of
ground
that
she
fell
she
got
upon
her
feet
again

hooven
lay
down
taking
hilda
in
her
arms
and
wrapping
her
shawl
about
her
the
infinite
vast
night
expanded
gigantic
all
around
them
at
this
elevation
they
were
far
above
the
city
it
was
still
close
overhead
whirled
the
chariots
of
the
fog
galloping
landward
smothering
lights
blurring
outlines
soon
all
sight
of
the
town
was
shut
out
even
the
solitary
house
on
the
hilltop
vanished
there
was
nothing
left
but
grey
wheeling
fog
and
the
mother
and
child
alone
shivering
in
a
little
strip
of
damp
ground
an
island
drifting
aimlessly
in
empty
space
hilda
fingers
touched
a
leaf
from
the
bush
and
instinctively
closed
upon
it
and
carried
it
to
her
mouth
mammy
she
said
i
eating
those
leaf
is

good
her
mother
did
not

hilda

herself
a

i
wass
her
voice
trailed
unintelligibly
to
silence
again
she
was
not
however
asleep
her
eyes
were
open
a
grateful
numbness
had
begun
to
creep
over
her
a
pleasing
she
no
longer
felt
the
pain
and
cramps
of
her
stomach
even
the
hunger
was
ceasing
to
bite
these
stuffed
artichokes
are
delicious
gerard
murmured
young
lambert
wiping
his
lips
with
a
corner
of
his
napkin
pardon
me
for
mentioning
it
but
your
dinner
must
be
my
and
this
asparagus
since
lambert
has
set
the
bad
example
observed
cedarquist
so
delicate
such
an
exquisite
flavour
how
do
you
manage
we
get
all
our
asparagus
from
the
southern
part
of
the
state
from
one
particular
ranch
explained
gerard
we
order
it
by
wire
and
get
it
only
twenty
hours
after
cutting
my
husband
sees
to
it
that
it
is
put
on
a
special
train
it
stops
at
this
ranch
just
to
take
on
our
asparagus
extravagant
is
it
but
i
simply
can
not
eat
asparagus
that
has
been
cut
more
than
a
nor
i
exclaimed
julian
lambert
who
posed
as
an
epicure
i
can
tell
to
an
hour
just
how
long
asparagus
has
been
fancy
eating
ordinary
market
asparagus
said
gerard
that
has
been
fingered
by
heaven
knows
how
many

cried
hilda
trying
to
push
open
eyelids
at
last
closed
mammy

you
just
trying
to
frighten
feebly
hilda
shook
her
by
the
shoulder
at
last
hooven
lips
stirred
putting
her
head
down
hilda
distinguished
the
whispered
words

layers
of

julian

to

up
cried
hilda
do
sleep
so
i
repeatedly
she
shook
her
repeatedly
she
tried
to
raise
the
inert
eyelids
with
the
point
of
her
finger
but
her
mother
no
longer
stirred
the
gaunt
lean
body
with
its
bony
face
and
sunken
lay
back
prone
upon
the
ground
the
feet
upturned
and
showing
the
ragged
worn
soles
of
the
shoes
the
forehead
and
grey
hair
beaded
with
fog
the
poor
faded
bonnet
awry
the
poor
faded
dress
soiled
and
torn
hilda
drew
close
to
her
mother
kissing
her
face
twining
her
arms
around
her
neck
for
a
long
time
she
lay
that
way
alternately
sobbing
and
sleeping
then
after
a
long
time
there
was
a
stir
she
woke
from
a
doze
to
find
a
police
officer
and
two
or
three
other
men
bending
over
her
some
one
carried
a
lantern
terrified
smitten
dumb
she
was
unable
to
answer
the
questions
put
to
her
then
a
woman
evidently
a
mistress
of
the
house
on
the
top
of
the
hill
arrived
and
took
hilda
in
her
arms
and
cried
over
her
i
take
the
little
girl
she
said
to
the
police
officer
but
the
mother
can
you
save
her
is
she
too
far
gone
i
sent
for
a
doctor
replied
the
other
just
before
the
ladies
left
the
table
young
lambert
raised
his
glass
of
madeira
turning
towards
the
wife
of
the
railroad
king
he
said
my
best
compliments
for
a
delightful
the
doctor
who
had
been
bending
over
hooven
rose
it
no
use
he
said
she
has
been
dead
some
time
exhaustion
from
chapter
ix
on
division
number
three
of
the
los
muertos
ranch
the
wheat
had
already
been
cut
and
behrman
on
a
certain
morning
in
the
first
week
of
august
drove
across
the
open
expanse
of
stubble
toward
the
southwest
his
eyes
searching
the
horizon
for
the
feather
of
smoke
that
would
mark
the
location
of
the
steam
harvester
however
he
saw
nothing
the
stubble
extended
onward
apparently
to
the
very
margin
of
the
world
at
length
behrman
halted
his
buggy
and
brought
out
his
field
glasses
from
beneath
the
seat
he
stood
up
in
his
place
and
adjusting
the
lenses
swept
the
prospect
to
the
south
and
west
it
was
the
same
as
though
the
sea
of
land
were
in
reality
the
ocean
and
he
lost
in
an
open
boat
were
scanning
the
waste
through
his
glasses
looking
for
the
smoke
of
a
steamer
hull
down
below
the
horizon
wonder
he
muttered
if
they
working
on
four
this
morning
at
length
he
murmured
an
ah
of
satisfaction
far
to
the
south
into
the
white
sheen
of
sky
immediately
over
the
horizon
he
made
out
a
faint
smudge
the
harvester
beyond
doubt
thither
behrman
turned
his
horse
head
it
was
all
of
an
drive
over
the
uneven
ground
and
through
the
crackling
stubble
but
at
length
he
reached
the
harvester
he
found
however
that
it
had
been
halted
the
sack
sewers
together
with
the
were
stretched
on
the
ground
in
the
shade
of
the
machine
while
the
engineer
and
were
pottering
about
a
portion
of
the
works
what
the
matter
billy
demanded
behrman
reining
up
the
engineer
turned
about
the
grain
is
heavy
in
here
we
thought
we
better
increase
the
speed
of
the
and
pulled
up
to
put
in
a
smaller
behrman
nodded
to
say
that
was
all
right
and
added
a
question
how
is
she
going
anywheres
from
to
thirty
sacks
to
the
acre
right
along
here
nothing
the
matter
with
that
i
nothing
in
the
world
one
of
the
sack
sewers
interposed
for
the
last
half
hour
we
been
throwing
off
three
bags
to
the
that
good
that
it
was
more
than
good
it
was
bonanza
and
all
that
division
of
the
great
ranch
was
thick
with
just
such
wonderful
wheat
never
had
los
muertos
been
more
generous
never
a
season
more
successful
behrman
drew
a
long
breath
of
satisfaction
he
knew
just
how
great
was
his
share
in
the
lands
which
had
just
been
absorbed
by
the
corporation
he
served
just
how
many
thousands
of
bushels
of
this
marvellous
crop
were
his
property
through
all
these
years
of
confusion
bickerings
open
hostility
and
at
last
actual
warfare
he
had
waited
nursing
his
patience
calm
with
the
firm
assurance
of
ultimate
success
the
end
at
length
had
come
he
had
entered
into
his
reward
and
saw
himself
at
last
installed
in
the
place
he
had
so
long
so
silently
coveted
saw
himself
chief
of
a
principality
the
master
of
the
wheat
the
sprocket
adjusted
the
engineer
called
up
the
gang
and
the
men
took
their
places
the
fireman
stoked
vigorously
the
two
sack
sewers
resumed
their
posts
on
the
sacking
platform
putting
on
the
goggles
that
kept
the
chaff
from
their
eyes
the
and
gripped
their
levers
the
harvester
shooting
a
column
of
thick
smoke
straight
upward
vibrating
to
the
top
of
the
stack
hissed
clanked
and
lurched
forward
instantly
motion
sprang
to
life
in
all
its
component
parts
the
header
knives
cutting
a
foot
swath
gnashed
like
teeth
beltings
slid
and
moved
like
smooth
flowing
streams
the
separator
whirred
the
agitator
jarred
and
crashed
cylinders
augers
fans
seeders
and
elevators
drapers
and
clattered
rumbled
buzzed
and
clanged
the
steam
hissed
and
rasped
the
ground
reverberated
a
hollow
note
and
the
thousands
upon
thousands
of
wheat
stalks
sliced
and
slashed
in
the
clashing
shears
of
the
header
rattled
like
dry
rushes
in
a
hurricane
as
they
fell
inward
and
were
caught
up
by
an
endless
belt
to
disappear
into
the
bowels
of
the
vast
brute
that
devoured
them
it
was
that
and
no
less
it
was
the
feeding
of
some
prodigious
monster
insatiable
with
iron
teeth
gnashing
and
threshing
into
the
fields
of
standing
wheat
devouring
always
never
glutted
never
satiated
swallowing
an
entire
harvest
snarling
and
slobbering
in
a
welter
of
warm
vapour
acrid
smoke
and
blinding
pungent
clouds
of
chaff
it
moved
in
the
standing
grain
a
hippopotamus
in
river
ooze
gorging
rushes
snorting
sweating
a
dinosaur
wallowing
through
thick
hot
grasses
floundering
there
crouching
grovelling
there
as
its
vast
jaws
crushed
and
tore
and
its
enormous
gullet
swallowed
incessant
ravenous
and
inordinate
behrman
very
much
amused
changed
places
with
one
of
the
sack
sewers
allowing
him
to
hold
his
horse
while
he
mounted
the
sacking
platform
and
took
his
place
the
trepidation
and
jostling
of
the
machine
shook
him
till
his
teeth
chattered
in
his
head
his
ears
were
shocked
and
assaulted
by
a
clamour
clashing
steel
straining
belts
jarring
woodwork
while
the
impalpable
chaff
powder
from
the
separators
settled
like
dust
in
his
hair
his
ears
eyes
and
mouth
directly
in
front
of
where
he
sat
on
the
platform
was
the
chute
from
the
cleaner
and
from
this
into
the
mouth
of
a
sack
spouted
an
unending
gush
of
grain
winnowed
cleaned
threshed
ready
for
the
mill
the
pour
from
the
chute
of
the
cleaner
had
for
behrman
an
immense
satisfaction
without
an
instant
pause
a
thick
rivulet
of
wheat
rolled
and
dashed
tumultuous
into
the
sack
in
half
a
minute
sometimes
in
twenty
seconds
the
sack
was
full
was
passed
over
to
the
second
sewer
the
mouth
reeved
up
and
the
sack
dumped
out
upon
the
ground
to
be
picked
up
by
the
wagons
and
hauled
to
the
railroad
behrman
hypnotised
sat
watching
that
river
of
grain
all
that
shrieking
bellowing
machinery
all
that
gigantic
organism
all
the
months
of
labour
the
ploughing
the
planting
the
prayers
for
rain
the
years
of
preparation
the
heartaches
the
anxiety
the
foresight
all
the
whole
business
of
the
ranch
the
work
of
horses
of
steam
of
men
and
boys
looked
to
this
spot
the
grain
chute
from
the
harvester
into
the
sacks
its
volume
was
the
index
of
failure
or
success
of
riches
or
poverty
and
at
this
point
the
labour
of
the
rancher
ended
here
at
the
lip
of
the
chute
he
parted
company
with
his
grain
and
from
here
the
wheat
streamed
forth
to
feed
the
world
the
yawning
mouths
of
the
sacks
might
well
stand
for
the
unnumbered
mouths
of
the
people
all
agape
for
food
and
here
into
these
sacks
at
first
so
lean
so
flaccid
attenuated
like
starved
stomachs
rushed
the
living
stream
of
food
insistent
interminable
filling
the
empty
fattening
the
shrivelled
making
it
sleek
and
heavy
and
solid
half
an
hour
later
the
harvester
stopped
again
the
men
on
the
sacking
platform
had
used
up
all
the
sacks
but
behrman
foreman
a
new
man
on
los
muertos
put
in
an
appearance
with
the
report
that
the
wagon
bringing
a
fresh
supply
was
approaching
how
is
the
grain
elevator
at
port
costa
getting
on
sir
finished
replied
behrman
the
new
master
of
los
muertos
had
decided
upon
accumulating
his
grain
in
bulk
in
a
great
elevator
at
the
port
where
the
grain
ships
for
liverpool
and
the
east
took
on
their
cargoes
to
this
end
he
had
bought
and
greatly
enlarged
a
building
at
port
costa
that
was
already
in
use
for
that
purpose
and
to
this
elevator
all
the
crop
of
los
muertos
was
to
be
carried
the
and
made
behrman
a
special
rate
by
the
way
said
behrman
to
his
superintendent
we
in
luck
fallon
buyer
was
in
bonneville
yesterday
he
buying
for
fallon
and
for
holt
too
i
happened
to
run
into
him
and
i
sold
a
ship

of
los
muertos

he
acting
for
some
indian
famine
relief
committee
lot
of
women
people
up
in
the
city
and
wanted
a
whole
cargo
i
made
a
deal
with
him
there

fifty
thousand
tons
of
disengaged
shipping
in
san
francisco
bay
right
now
and
ships
are
fighting

i

behrman

stop
down
here
and
see
that
those
carpenters

peculiar
i
not

any
not
to
fallon
buyer
he
only
put
me
on
to
the
thing
acting
direct
with
these
women
people
and
i
got
to
have
some
hand
in
shipping
this
stuff
myself
but
i
made
my
selling
figure
cover
the
price
of
a
charter
it
a
queer
deal
and
i
do
fancy
it
much
but
there
boodle
in
it
i
go
to
port
costa
a
little
later
on
in
the
day
when
behrman
had
satisfied
himself
that
his
harvesting
was
going
forward
favourably
he
reentered
his
buggy
and
driving
to
the
county
road
turned
southward
towards
the
los
muertos
ranch
house
he
had
not
gone
far
however
before
he
became
aware
of
a
familiar
figure
on
jogging
slowly
along
ahead
of
him
he
recognised
presley
he
shook
the
reins
over
his
horse
back
and
very
soon
ranging
up
by
the
side
of
the
young
man
passed
the
time
of
day
with
him
well
what
brings
you
down
here
again
presley
he
observed
i
thought
we
had
seen
the
last
of
i
came
down
to
say
to
my
friends
answered
presley
shortly
going
away
yes
to
well
upon
my
word
for
your
health
hey
you
look
knocked
up
asserted
the
other
by
the
way
he
added
i
suppose
you
heard
the
news
presley
shrank
a
little
of
late
the
reports
of
disasters
had
followed
so
swiftly
upon
one
another
that
he
had
begun
to
tremble
and
to
quail
at
every
unexpected
bit
of
information
what
news
do
you
mean
he
asked
about
dyke
he
has
been
convicted
the
judge
sentenced
him
for
for
life
riding
on
by
the
side
of
this
man
through
the
ranches
by
the
county
road
presley
repeated
these
words
to
himself
till
the
full
effect
of
them
burst
at
last
upon
him
jailed
for
life
no
outlook
no
hope
for
the
future
day
after
day
year
after
year
to
tread
the
rounds
of
the
same
gloomy
monotony
he
saw
the
grey
stone
walls
the
iron
doors
the
flagging
of
the
yard
bare
of
grass
or
trees
the
cell
narrow
bald
cheerless
the
prison
garb
the
prison
fare
and
round
all
the
grim
granite
of
insuperable
barriers
shutting
out
the
world
shutting
in
the
man
with
outcasts
with
the
pariah
dogs
of
society
thieves
murderers
men
below
the
beasts
lost
to
all
decency
drugged
with
opium
utter
reprobates
to
this
dyke
had
been
brought
dyke
than
whom
no
man
had
been
more
honest
more
courageous
more
jovial
this
was
the
end
of
him
a
prison
this
was
his
final
estate
a
criminal
presley
found
an
excuse
for
riding
on
leaving
behrman
behind
him
he
did
not
stop
at
caraher
saloon
for
the
heat
of
his
rage
had
long
since
begun
to
cool
and
dispassionately
he
saw
things
in
their
true
light
for
all
the
tragedy
of
his
wife
death
caraher
was
none
the
less
an
evil
influence
among
the
ranchers
an
influence
that
worked
only
to
the
inciting
of
crime
unwilling
to
venture
himself
to
risk
his
own
life
the
anarchist
had
goaded
dyke
and
presley
both
to
murder
a
bad
man
a
plague
spot
in
the
world
of
the
ranchers
poisoning
the
farmers
bodies
with
alcohol
and
their
minds
with
discontent
at
last
presley
arrived
at
the
ranch
house
of
los
muertos
the
place
was
silent
the
grass
on
the
lawn
was
half
dead
and
over
a
foot
high
the
beginnings
of
weeds
showed
here
and
there
in
the
driveway
he
tied
his
horse
to
a
ring
in
the
trunk
of
one
of
the
larger
eucalyptus
trees
and
entered
the
house
derrick
met
him
in
the
the
old
look
of
uneasiness
almost
of
terror
had
gone
from
her
brown
eyes
there
was
in
them
instead
the
expression
of
one
to
whom
a
contingency
long
dreaded
has
arrived
and
passed
the
stolidity
of
a
settled
grief
of
an
irreparable
calamity
of
a
despair
from
which
there
was
no
escape
was
in
her
look
her
manner
her
voice
she
was
listless
apathetic
calm
with
the
calmness
of
a
woman
who
knows
she
can
suffer
no
further
we
are
going
away
she
told
presley
as
the
two
sat
down
at
opposite
ends
of
the
dining
table
just
magnus
and
myself
all
there
is
left
of
us
there
is
very
little
money
left
magnus
can
hardly
take
care
of
himself
to
say
nothing
of
me
i
must
look
after
him
now
we
are
going
to
why
there
you
see
she
explained
it
happens
that
my
old
place
is
vacant
in
the
seminary
there
i
am
going
back
to
teach
she
smiled
wearily
it
is
beginning
all
over
again
is
it
only
there
is
nothing
to
look
forward
to
now
magnus
is
an
old
man
already
and
i
must
take
care
of
he
will
go
with
you
then
presley
said
that

be
some
comfort
to
you
at
i
do
know
she
said
slowly
you
have
not
seen
magnus

you
mean

he
any
better
would
you
like
to
see
him

is
in
the
office

presley
rose
he
hesitated
a
moment
then
mrs
annixter
he
asked
hilma

with
you
i
should
like
to
see
her
before
i
go
in
and
see
magnus
said
derrick
i
will
tell

presley
stepped
across
the
hallway
with
the
glass
roof
and
after
knocking
three
times
at
the
office
door
pushed
it
open
and
entered
magnus
sat
in
the
chair
before
the
desk
and
did
not
look
up
as
presley
entered
he
had
the
appearance
of
a
man
nearer
eighty
than
sixty
all
the
erectness
was
broken
and
bent
it
was
as
though
the
muscles
that
once
had
held
the
back
rigid
the
chin
high
had
softened
and
stretched
a
certain
fatness
the
obesity
of
inertia
hung
heavy
around
the
hips
and
abdomen
the
eye
was
watery
and
vague
the
cheeks
and
chin
unshaven
and
unkempt
the
grey
hair
had
lost
its
forward
curl
towards
the
temples
and
hung
thin
and
ragged
around
the
ears
the
nose
seemed
hooked
to
meet
the
chin
the
lips
were
slack
the
mouth
where
once
the
governor
had
been
a
model
of
neatness
in
his
dress
the
frock
coat
buttoned
the
linen
clean
he
now
sat
in
his
shirt
sleeves
the
waistcoat
open
and
showing
the
soiled
shirt
his
hands
were
stained
with
ink
and
these
the
only
members
of
his
body
that
yet
appeared
to
retain
their
activity
were
busy
with
a
great
pile
of
papers
oblong
legal
documents
that
littered
the
table
before
him
without
a
cessation
these
hands
of
the
governor
came
and
went
among
the
papers
deft
nimble
dexterous
magnus
was
sorting
papers
from
the
heap
upon
his
left
hand
he
selected
a
document
opened
it
glanced
over
it
then
tied
it
carefully
and
laid
it
away
upon
a
second
pile
on
his
right
hand
when
all
the
papers
were
in
one
pile
he
reversed
the
process
taking
from
his
right
hand
to
place
upon
his
left
then
back
from
left
to
right
again
then
once
more
from
right
to
left
he
spoke
no
word
he
sat
absolutely
still
even
his
eyes
did
not
move
only
his
hands
swift
nervous
agitated
seemed
alive
why
how
are
you
governor
said
presley
coming
forward
magnus
turned
slowly
about
and
looked
at
him
and
at
the
hand
in
which
he
shook
his
own
ah
he
said
at
length
presley
then
his
glance
fell
and
he
looked
aimlessly
about
upon
the
floor
i
come
to
say
governor
continued
presley
i
going
going
away
yes
why
it
presley
governor
i
going
away
i
come
to
say
magnus
bent
his
brows
what
are
you
saying
for
i
going
away
the
governor
did
not
answer
staring
at
the
ledge
of
the
desk
he
seemed
lost
in
thought
there
was
a
long
silence
then
at
length
presley
said
how
are
you
getting
on
governor
magnus
looked
up
slowly
why
it
presley
he
said
how
do
you
do
are
you
getting
on
all
right
sir
yes
said
magnus
after
a
while
yes
all
right
i
am
going
away
come
to
say
no
he
interrupted
himself
with
a
deprecatory
smile
you
said
that
did
you
well
you
are
going
away
too
your
wife
tells
yes
i
going
away
i
ca
stay
on
he
hesitated
a
long
time
groping
for
the
right
word
i
ca
stay
on
on
what
the
name
of
this
place
los
muertos
put
in
presley
no
it
is
yes
it
is
too
that
right
los
muertos
i
do
know
where
my
memory
has
gone
to
of
well
i
hope
you
will
be
better
soon
as
presley
spoke
the
words
behrman
entered
the
room
and
the
governor
sprang
up
with
unexpected
agility
and
stood
against
the
wall
drawing
one
long
breath
after
another
watching
the
railroad
agent
with
intent
eyes
behrman
saluted
both
men
affably
and
sat
down
near
the
desk
drawing
the
links
of
his
heavy
watch
chain
through
his
fat
fingers
there
was
anybody
outside
when
i
knocked
but
i
heard
your
voice
in
here
governor
so
i
came
right
in
i
wanted
to
ask
you
governor
if
my
carpenters
can
begin
work
in
here
day
after
i
want
to
take
down
that
partition
there
and
throw
this
room
and
the
next
into
one
i
guess
that
will
be
wo
it
you
be
out
of
here
by
then
you
there
was
no
vagueness
about
magnus
speech
or
manner
now
there
was
that
same
alertness
in
his
demeanour
that
one
sees
in
a
tamed
lion
in
the
presence
of
its
trainer
yes
yes
he
said
quickly
you
can
send
your
men
here
i
will
be
gone
by
i
do
want
to
seem
to
hurry
you
no
you
will
not
hurry
me
i
am
ready
to
go
anything
i
can
do
for
you
governor
yes
there
is
governor
insisted
behrman
i
think
now
that
all
is
over
we
ought
to
be
good
friends
i
think
i
can
do
something
for
you
we
still
want
an
assistant
in
the
local
freight
manager
office
now
what
do
you
say
to
having
a
try
at
it
there
a
salary
of
fifty
a
month
goes
with
it
i
guess
you
must
be
in
need
of
money
now
and
there
always
the
wife
to
support
what
do
you
say
will
you
try
the
place
presley
could
only
stare
at
the
man
in
speechless
wonder
what
was
he
driving
at
what
reason
was
there
back
of
this
new
move
and
why
should
it
be
made
thus
openly
and
in
his
hearing
an
explanation
occurred
to
him
was
this
merely
a
pleasantry
on
the
part
of
behrman
a
way
of
enjoying
to
the
full
his
triumph
was
he
testing
the
completeness
of
his
victory
trying
to
see
just
how
far
he
could
go
how
far
beneath
his
feet
he
could
push
his
enemy
what
do
you
say
he
repeated
will
you
try
the
place
you
you
insist
inquired
the
governor
oh
i
not
insisting
on
anything
cried
behrman
i
offering
you
a
place
that
all
will
you
take
it
yes
yes
i
take
you
come
over
to
our
side
yes
i
come
you
have
to
turn
understand
i
turn
guess
there
may
be
times
when
you
have
to
take
orders
from
i
take
orders
from
you
have
to
be
loyal
to
railroad
you
know
no
funny
i
be
loyal
to
the
you
would
like
the
place
then
behrman
turned
from
magnus
who
at
once
resumed
his
seat
and
began
again
to
sort
his
papers
well
presley
said
the
railroad
agent
i
guess
i
wo
see
you
i
hope
not
answered
the
other
tut
tut
presley
you
know
you
ca
make
me
he
put
on
his
hat
of
varnished
straw
and
wiped
his
fat
forehead
with
his
handkerchief
of
late
he
had
grown
fatter
than
ever
and
the
linen
vest
stamped
with
a
multitude
of
interlocked
horseshoes
strained
tight
its
imitation
pearl
buttons
across
the
great
protuberant
stomach
presley
looked
at
the
man
a
moment
before
replying
but
a
few
weeks
ago
he
could
not
thus
have
faced
the
great
enemy
of
the
farmers
without
a
gust
of
blind
rage
blowing
tempestuous
through
all
his
bones
now
however
he
found
to
his
surprise
that
his
fury
had
lapsed
to
a
profound
contempt
in
which
there
was
bitterness
but
no
truculence
he
was
tired
tired
to
death
of
the
whole
business
yes
he
answered
deliberately
i
am
going
away
you
have
ruined
this
place
for
me
i
could
live
here
where
i
should
have
to
see
you
or
the
results
of
what
you
have
done
whenever
i
stirred
out
of
nonsense
presley
answered
the
other
refusing
to
become
angry
that
foolishness
that
kind
of
talk
though
of
course
i
understand
how
you
feel
i
guess
it
was
you
was
it
who
threw
that
bomb
into
my
house
it
well
that
do
show
any
common
sense
presley
returned
behrman
with
perfect
aplomb
what
could
you
have
gained
by
killing
me
not
so
much
probably
as
you
have
gained
by
killing
harran
and
annixter
but
that
all
passed
now
you
safe
from
the
strangeness
of
this
talk
the
oddity
of
the
situation
burst
upon
him
and
he
laughed
aloud
it
do
seem
as
though
you
could
be
brought
to
book
behrman
by
anybody
or
by
any
means
does
it
they
ca
get
at
you
through
the
courts
the
law
ca
get
you
dyke
pistol
missed
fire
for
just
your
benefit
and
you
even
escaped
caraher
six
inches
of
plugged
gas
pipe
just
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
you
best
give
it
up
pres
my
boy
returned
the
other
i
guess
there
ai
anything
can
touch
me
well
magnus
he
said
turning
once
more
to
the
governor
well
i
think
over
what
you
say
and
let
you
know
if
i
can
get
the
place
for
you
in
a
day
or
two
you
see
he
added
you
getting
pretty
old
magnus
presley
flung
himself
from
the
room
unable
any
longer
to
witness
the
depths
into
which
magnus
had
fallen
what
other
scenes
of
degradation
were
enacted
in
that
room
how
much
further
behrman
carried
the
humiliation
he
did
not
know
he
suddenly
felt
that
the
air
of
the
office
was
choking
him
he
hurried
up
to
what
once
had
been
his
own
room
on
his
way
he
could
not
but
note
that
much
of
the
house
was
in
disarray
a
great
was
in
progress
trunks
stood
in
the
hallways
crates
and
cases
in
a
litter
of
straw
encumbered
the
rooms
the
servants
came
and
went
with
armfuls
of
books
ornaments
articles
of
clothing
presley
took
from
his
room
only
a
few
manuscripts
and
and
a
small
valise
full
of
his
personal
effects
at
the
doorway
he
paused
and
holding
the
knob
of
the
door
in
his
hand
looked
back
into
the
room
a
very
long
time
he
descended
to
the
lower
floor
and
entered
the
derrick
had
disappeared
presley
stood
for
a
long
moment
in
front
of
the
fireplace
looking
about
the
room
remembering
the
scenes
that
he
had
witnessed
there
the
conference
when
osterman
had
first
suggested
the
fight
for
railroad
commissioner
and
then
later
the
attack
on
lyman
derrick
and
the
sudden
revelation
of
that
inconceivable
treachery
but
as
he
stood
considering
these
things
a
door
to
his
right
opened
and
hilma
entered
the
room
presley
came
forward
holding
out
his
hand
all
unable
to
believe
his
eyes
it
was
a
woman
grave
dignified
composed
who
advanced
to
meet
him
hilma
was
dressed
in
black
the
cut
and
fashion
of
the
gown
severe
almost
monastic
all
the
little
feminine
and
contradictory
daintinesses
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
her
statuesque
calm
evenness
of
contour
yet
remained
but
it
was
the
calmness
of
great
sorrow
of
infinite
resignation
beautiful
she
still
remained
but
she
was
older
the
seriousness
of
one
who
has
gained
the
knowledge
of
the
world
knowledge
of
its
evil
seemed
to
envelope
her
the
calm
gravity
of
a
great
suffering
past
but
not
forgotten
sat
upon
her
not
yet
she
exhibited
the
demeanour
of
a
woman
of
forty
the
amplitude
of
her
figure
the
fulness
of
hip
and
shoulder
the
great
deep
swell
from
waist
to
throat
were
gone
she
had
grown
thinner
and
in
consequence
seemed
unusually
almost
unnaturally
tall
her
neck
was
slender
the
outline
of
her
full
lips
and
round
chin
was
a
little
sharp
her
arms
those
wonderful
beautiful
arms
of
hers
were
a
little
shrunken
but
her
eyes
were
as
wide
open
as
always
rimmed
as
ever
by
the
thin
intensely
black
line
of
the
lashes
and
her
brown
fragrant
hair
was
still
thick
still
at
times
glittered
and
coruscated
in
the
sun
when
she
spoke
it
was
with
the
velvety
huskiness
of
voice
that
annixter
had
learned
to
love
so
well
oh
it
is
you
she
said
giving
him
her
hand
you
were
good
to
want
to
see
me
before
you
left
i
hear
that
you
are
going
she
sat
down
upon
the
sofa
yes
presley
answered
drawing
a
chair
near
to
her
yes
i
felt
i
could
not
stay
down
here
any
longer
i
am
going
to
take
a
long
ocean
voyage
my
ship
sails
in
a
few
days
but
you
annixter
what
are
you
going
to
do
is
there
any
way
i
can
serve
you
no
she
answered
nothing
papa
is
doing
well
we
are
living
here
you
are
well
she
made
a
little
helpless
gesture
with
both
her
hands
smiling
very
sadly
as
you
see
she
answered
as
he
talked
presley
was
looking
at
her
intently
her
dignity
was
a
new
element
in
her
character
and
the
certain
slender
effect
of
her
figure
emphasised
now
by
the
long
folds
of
the
black
gown
she
wore
carried
it
almost
superbly
she
conveyed
something
of
the
impression
of
a
queen
in
exile
but
she
had
lost
none
of
her
womanliness
rather
the
contrary
adversity
had
softened
her
as
well
as
deepened
her
presley
saw
that
very
clearly
hilma
had
arrived
now
at
her
perfect
maturity
she
had
known
great
love
and
she
had
known
great
grief
and
the
woman
that
had
awakened
in
her
with
her
affection
for
annixter
had
been
strengthened
and
infinitely
ennobled
by
his
death
what
if
things
had
been
different
thus
as
he
conversed
with
her
presley
found
himself
wondering
her
sweetness
her
beautiful
gentleness
and
tenderness
were
almost
like
palpable
presences
it
was
almost
as
if
a
caress
had
been
laid
softly
upon
his
cheek
as
if
a
gentle
hand
closed
upon
his
here
he
knew
was
sympathy
here
he
knew
was
an
infinite
capacity
for
love
then
suddenly
all
the
tired
heart
of
him
went
out
towards
her
a
longing
to
give
the
best
that
was
in
him
to
the
memory
of
her
to
be
strong
and
noble
because
of
her
to
reshape
his
purposeless
life
with
her
nobility
and
purity
and
gentleness
for
his
inspiration
leaped
all
at
once
within
him
leaped
and
stood
firm
hardening
to
a
resolve
stronger
than
any
he
had
ever
known
for
an
instant
he
told
himself
that
the
suddenness
of
this
new
emotion
must
be
evidence
of
its
insincerity
he
was
perfectly
well
aware
that
his
impulses
were
abrupt
and
of
short
duration
but
he
knew
that
this
was
not
sudden
without
realising
it
he
had
been
from
the
first
drawn
to
hilma
and
all
through
these
last
terrible
days
since
the
time
he
had
seen
her
at
los
muertos
just
after
the
battle
at
the
ditch
she
had
obtruded
continually
upon
his
thoughts
the
sight
of
her
more
beautiful
than
ever
quiet
strong
reserved
had
only
brought
matters
to
a
culmination
are
you
he
asked
her
are
you
so
unhappy
hilma
that
you
can
look
forward
to
no
more
brightness
in
your
life
unless
i
could
forget
forget
my
husband
she
answered
how
can
i
be
happy
i
would
rather
be
unhappy
in
remembering
him
than
happy
in
forgetting
him
he
was
my
whole
world
literally
and
truly
nothing
seemed
to
count
before
i
knew
him
and
nothing
can
count
for
me
now
after
i
have
lost
you
think
now
he
answered
that
in
being
happy
again
you
would
be
disloyal
to
him
but
you
will
find
after
a
while
years
from
now
that
it
need
not
be
so
the
part
of
you
that
belonged
to
your
husband
can
always
keep
him
sacred
that
part
of
you
belongs
to
him
and
he
to
it
but
you
are
young
you
have
all
your
life
to
live
yet
your
sorrow
need
not
be
a
burden
to
you
if
you
consider
it
as
you
should
as
you
will
some
day
believe
me
it
will
only
be
a
great
help
to
you
it
will
make
you
more
noble
a
truer
woman
more
i
think
i
see
she
answered
and
i
never
thought
about
it
in
that
light
i
want
to
help
you
he
answered
as
you
have
helped
me
i
want
to
be
your
friend
and
above
all
things
i
do
not
want
to
see
your
life
wasted
i
am
going
away
and
it
is
quite
possible
i
shall
never
see
you
again
but
you
will
always
be
a
help
to
i
do
not
understand
she
answered
but
i
know
you
mean
to
be
very
very
kind
to
me
yes
i
hope
when
you
come
back
if
you
ever
do
you
will
still
be
that
i
do
not
know
why
you
should
want
to
be
so
kind
unless
yes
of
course
you
were
my
husband
dearest
they
talked
a
little
longer
and
at
length
presley
rose
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
see
derrick
again
he
said
it
would
only
serve
to
make
her
very
unhappy
will
you
explain
that
to
her
i
think
she
will
yes
answered
hilma
yes
i
there
was
a
pause
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
more
for
either
of
them
to
say
presley
held
out
his
hand
she
said
as
she
gave
him
hers
he
carried
it
to
his
lips
he
answered
and
may
god
bless
he
turned
away
abruptly
and
left
the
room
but
as
he
was
quietly
making
his
way
out
of
the
house
hoping
to
get
to
his
horse
unobserved
he
came
suddenly
upon
dyke
and
sidney
on
the
porch
of
the
house
he
had
forgotten
that
since
the
affair
at
the
ditch
los
muertos
had
been
a
home
to
the
engineer
mother
and
daughter
and
you
dyke
he
asked
as
he
took
her
hand
in
this
of
everything
where
do
you
go
to
the
city
she
answered
to
san
francisco
i
have
a
sister
there
who
will
look
after
the
little
but
you
how
about
yourself
dyke
she
answered
him
in
a
quiet
voice
monotonous
expressionless
i
am
going
to
die
very
soon
presley
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
live
any
longer
my
son
is
in
prison
for
life
everything
is
over
for
me
and
i
am
tired
worn
you
must
talk
like
that
dyke
protested
presley
nonsense
you
will
live
long
enough
to
see
the
little
tad
he
tried
to
be
cheerful
but
he
knew
his
words
lacked
the
ring
of
conviction
death
already
overshadowed
the
face
of
the
engineer
mother
he
felt
that
she
spoke
the
truth
and
as
he
stood
there
speaking
to
her
for
the
last
time
his
arm
about
little
sidney
shoulder
he
knew
that
he
was
seeing
the
beginnings
of
the
wreck
of
another
family
and
that
like
hilda
hooven
another
baby
girl
was
to
be
started
in
life
through
no
fault
of
hers
fearfully
handicapped
weighed
down
at
the
threshold
of
existence
with
a
load
of
disgrace
hilda
hooven
and
sidney
dyke
what
was
to
be
their
histories
the
one
sister
of
an
outcast
the
other
daughter
of
a
convict
and
he
thought
of
that
other
young
girl
the
little
honora
gerard
the
heiress
of
millions
petted
loved
receiving
adulation
from
all
who
came
near
to
her
whose
only
care
was
to
choose
from
among
the
multitude
of
pleasures
that
the
world
hastened
to
present
to
her
consideration
he
said
holding
out
his
hand
he
kissed
the
little
girl
clasped
dyke
hand
a
moment
with
his
then
slinging
his
satchel
about
his
shoulders
by
the
long
strap
with
which
it
was
provided
left
the
house
and
mounting
his
horse
rode
away
from
los
muertos
never
to
return
presley
came
out
upon
the
county
road
at
a
little
distance
to
his
left
he
could
see
the
group
of
buildings
where
once
broderson
had
lived
these
were
being
remodelled
at
length
to
suit
the
larger
demands
of
the
new
agriculture
a
strange
man
came
out
by
the
road
gate
no
doubt
the
new
proprietor
presley
turned
away
hurrying
northwards
along
the
county
road
by
the
mammoth
and
the
long
of
poplars
he
came
to
caraher
place
there
was
no
change
here
the
saloon
had
weathered
the
storm
indispensable
to
the
new
as
well
as
to
the
old
regime
the
same
dusty
buggies
and
buckboards
were
tied
under
the
shed
and
as
presley
hurried
by
he
could
distinguish
caraher
voice
loud
as
ever
still
proclaiming
his
creed
of
annihilation
bonneville
presley
avoided
he
had
no
associations
with
the
town
he
turned
aside
from
the
road
and
crossing
the
northwest
corner
of
los
muertos
and
the
line
of
the
railroad
turned
back
along
the
upper
road
till
he
came
to
the
long
trestle
and
annixter
silence
desolation
abandonment
a
vast
stillness
profound
unbroken
brooded
low
over
all
the
place
no
living
thing
stirred
the
rusted
on
the
tower
of
the
artesian
well
was
motionless
the
great
barn
empty
the
windows
of
the
ranch
house
cook
house
and
dairy
boarded
up
nailed
upon
a
tree
near
the
broken
gateway
was
a
board
white
painted
with
stencilled
letters
bearing
the
inscription
warning
all
persons
found
trespassing
on
these
premises
will
be
prosecuted
to
the
fullest
extent
of
the
law
by
order
and
as
he
had
planned
presley
reached
the
hills
by
the
head
waters
of
broderson
creek
late
in
the
afternoon
toilfully
he
climbed
them
reached
the
highest
crest
and
turning
about
looked
long
and
for
the
last
time
at
all
the
reach
of
the
valley
unrolled
beneath
him
the
land
of
the
ranches
opened
out
forever
and
forever
under
the
stimulus
of
that
measureless
range
of
vision
the
whole
gigantic
sweep
of
the
san
joaquin
expanded
titanic
before
the
eye
of
the
mind
flagellated
with
heat
quivering
and
shimmering
under
the
sun
red
eye
it
was
the
season
after
the
harvest
and
the
great
earth
the
mother
after
its
period
of
reproduction
its
pains
of
labour
delivered
of
the
fruit
of
its
loins
slept
the
sleep
of
exhaustion
in
the
infinite
repose
of
the
colossus
benignant
eternal
strong
the
nourisher
of
nations
the
feeder
of
an
entire
world
and
as
presley
looked
there
came
to
him
strong
and
true
the
sense
and
the
significance
of
all
the
enigma
of
growth
he
seemed
for
one
instant
to
touch
the
explanation
of
existence
men
were
nothings
mere
animalculae
mere
ephemerides
that
fluttered
and
fell
and
were
forgotten
between
dawn
and
dusk
vanamee
had
said
there
was
no
death
but
for
one
second
presley
could
go
one
step
further
men
were
naught
death
was
naught
life
was
naught
force
only
existed
force
that
brought
men
into
the
world
force
that
crowded
them
out
of
it
to
make
way
for
the
succeeding
generation
force
that
made
the
wheat
grow
force
that
garnered
it
from
the
soil
to
give
place
to
the
succeeding
crop
it
was
the
mystery
of
creation
the
stupendous
miracle
of
recreation
the
vast
rhythm
of
the
seasons
measured
alternative
the
sun
and
the
stars
keeping
time
as
the
eternal
symphony
of
reproduction
swung
in
its
tremendous
cadences
like
the
colossal
pendulum
of
an
almighty
machine
primordial
energy
flung
out
from
the
hand
of
the
lord
god
himself
immortal
calm
infinitely
strong
but
as
he
stood
thus
looking
down
upon
the
great
valley
he
was
aware
of
the
figure
of
a
man
far
in
the
distance
moving
steadily
towards
the
mission
of
san
juan
the
man
was
hardly
more
than
a
dot
but
there
was
something
unmistakably
familiar
in
his
gait
and
besides
this
presley
could
fancy
that
he
was
hatless
he
touched
his
pony
with
his
spur
the
man
was
vanamee
beyond
all
doubt
and
a
little
later
presley
descending
the
maze
of
and
that
led
down
towards
the
broderson
creek
overtook
his
friend
instantly
presley
was
aware
of
an
immense
change
vanamee
face
was
still
that
of
an
ascetic
still
glowed
with
the
rarefied
intelligence
of
a
young
seer
a
of
hebraic
legends
but
the
shadow
of
that
great
sadness
which
for
so
long
had
brooded
over
him
was
gone
the
grief
that
once
he
had
fancied
deathless
was
indeed
dead
or
rather
swallowed
up
in
a
victorious
joy
that
radiated
like
sunlight
at
dawn
from
the
eyes
and
the
hollow
swarthy
cheeks
they
talked
together
till
nearly
sundown
but
to
presley
questions
as
to
the
reasons
for
vanamee
happiness
the
other
would
say
nothing
once
only
he
allowed
himself
to
touch
upon
the
subject
death
and
grief
are
little
things
he
said
they
are
transient
life
must
be
before
death
and
joy
before
grief
else
there
are
no
such
things
as
death
or
grief
these
are
only
negatives
life
is
positive
death
is
only
the
absence
of
life
just
as
night
is
only
the
absence
of
day
and
if
this
is
so
there
is
no
such
thing
as
death
there
is
only
life
and
the
suppression
of
life
that
we
foolishly
say
is
death
i
say
not
extinction
i
do
not
say
that
life
returns
life
never
departs
life
simply
is
for
certain
seasons
it
is
hidden
in
the
dark
but
is
that
death
extinction
annihilation
i
take
it
thank
god
that
it
is
not
does
the
grain
of
wheat
hidden
for
certain
seasons
in
the
dark
die
the
grain
we
think
is
dead
resumes
again
but
how
not
as
one
grain
but
as
twenty
so
all
life
death
is
only
real
for
all
the
detritus
of
the
world
for
all
the
sorrow
for
all
the
injustice
for
all
the
grief
presley
the
good
never
dies
evil
dies
cruelty
oppression
selfishness
greed
these
die
but
nobility
but
love
but
sacrifice
but
generosity
but
truth
thank
god
for
it
small
as
they
are
difficult
as
it
is
to
discover
them
these
live
forever
these
are
eternal
you
are
all
broken
all
cast
down
by
what
you
have
seen
in
this
valley
this
hopeless
struggle
this
apparently
hopeless
despair
well
the
end
is
not
yet
what
is
it
that
remains
after
all
is
over
after
the
dead
are
buried
and
the
hearts
are
broken
look
at
it
all
from
the
vast
height
of
humanity
greatest
good
to
the
greatest
numbers
what
remains
men
perish
men
are
corrupted
hearts
are
rent
asunder
but
what
remains
untouched
unassailable
undefiled
try
to
find
that
not
only
in
this
but
in
every
crisis
of
the
world
life
and
you
will
find
if
your
view
be
large
enough
that
it
is
not
evil
but
good
that
in
the
end
there
was
a
long
pause
presley
his
mind
full
of
new
thoughts
held
his
peace
and
vanamee
added
at
length
i
believed
angele
dead
i
wept
over
her
grave
mourned
for
her
as
dead
in
corruption
she
has
come
back
to
me
more
beautiful
than
ever
do
not
ask
me
any
further
to
put
this
story
this
idyl
into
words
would
for
me
be
a
profanation
this
must
suffice
you
angele
has
returned
to
me
and
i
am
happy
he
rose
suddenly
the
friends
clasped
each
other
hands
we
shall
probably
never
meet
again
said
vanamee
but
if
these
are
the
last
words
i
ever
speak
to
you
listen
to
them
and
remember
them
because
i
know
i
speak
the
truth
evil
is
never
judge
of
the
whole
round
of
life
by
the
mere
segment
you
can
see
the
whole
is
in
the
end
abruptly
he
took
himself
away
he
was
gone
presley
alone
thoughtful
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
passed
on
through
the
ranches
here
teeming
with
ripened
wheat
his
face
set
from
them
forever
not
so
vanamee
for
hours
he
roamed
the
countryside
now
through
the
deserted
cluster
of
buildings
that
had
once
been
annixter
home
now
through
the
rustling
and
as
yet
uncut
wheat
of
quien
sabe
now
treading
the
slopes
of
the
hills
far
to
the
north
and
again
following
the
winding
courses
of
the
streams
thus
he
spent
the
night
at
length
the
day
broke
resplendent
cloudless
the
night
was
passed
there
was
all
the
sparkle
and
effervescence
of
joy
in
the
crystal
sunlight
as
the
dawn
expanded
roseate
and
at
length
flamed
dazzling
to
the
zenith
when
the
sun
moved
over
the
edge
of
the
world
and
looked
down
upon
all
the
earth
like
the
eye
of
god
the
father
at
the
moment
vanamee
stood
in
the
wheat
in
a
solitary
corner
of
the
quien
sabe
rancho
he
turned
eastward
facing
the
celestial
glory
of
the
day
and
sent
his
voiceless
call
far
from
him
across
the
golden
grain
out
towards
the
little
valley
of
flowers
swiftly
the
answer
came
it
advanced
to
meet
him
the
flowers
of
the
seed
ranch
were
gone
dried
and
parched
by
the
summer
sun
shedding
their
seed
by
handfuls
to
be
sown
again
and
blossom
yet
another
time
the
seed
ranch
was
no
longer
royal
with
colour
the
roses
the
lilies
the
carnations
the
hyacinths
the
poppies
the
violets
the
mignonette
all
these
had
vanished
the
little
valley
was
without
colour
where
once
it
had
exhaled
the
most
delicious
perfume
it
was
now
odourless
under
the
blinding
light
of
the
day
it
stretched
to
its
hillsides
bare
brown
unlovely
the
romance
of
the
place
had
vanished
but
with
it
had
vanished
the
vision
it
was
no
longer
a
figment
of
his
imagination
a
creature
of
dreams
that
advanced
to
meet
vanamee
it
was
reality
it
was
angele
in
the
flesh
vital
sane
material
who
at
last
issued
forth
from
the
entrance
of
the
little
valley
romance
had
vanished
but
better
than
romance
was
here
not
a
manifestation
not
a
dream
but
her
very
self
the
night
was
gone
but
the
sun
had
risen
the
flowers
had
disappeared
but
strong
vigorous
noble
the
wheat
had
come
in
the
wheat
he
waited
for
her
he
saw
her
coming
she
was
simply
dressed
no
fanciful
wreath
of
was
about
her
head
now
no
strange
garment
of
red
and
gold
enveloped
her
now
it
was
no
longer
an
ephemeral
illusion
of
the
night
evanescent
mystic
but
a
simple
country
girl
coming
to
meet
her
lover
the
vision
of
the
night
had
been
beautiful
but
what
was
it
compared
to
this
reality
was
better
than
romance
the
simple
honesty
of
a
loving
trusting
heart
was
better
than
a
legend
of
flowers
an
hallucination
of
the
moonlight
she
came
nearer
bathed
in
sunlight
he
saw
her
face
to
face
saw
her
hair
hanging
in
two
straight
plaits
on
either
side
of
her
face
saw
the
enchanting
fulness
of
her
lips
the
strange
balancing
movement
of
her
head
upon
her
slender
neck
but
now
she
was
no
longer
asleep
the
wonderful
eyes
violet
blue
with
their
perplexing
oriental
slant
towards
the
temples
were
wide
open
and
fixed
upon
his
from
out
the
world
of
romance
out
of
the
moonlight
and
the
star
sheen
out
of
the
faint
radiance
of
the
lilies
and
the
still
air
heavy
with
perfume
she
had
at
last
come
to
him
the
moonlight
the
flowers
and
the
dream
were
all
vanished
away
angele
was
realised
in
the
wheat
she
stood
forth
in
the
sunlight
a
fact
and
no
longer
a
fancy
he
ran
forward
to
meet
her
and
she
held
out
her
arms
to
him
he
caught
her
to
him
and
she
turning
her
face
to
his
kissed
him
on
the
mouth
i
love
you
i
love
you
she
murmured
upon
descending
from
his
train
at
port
costa
behrman
asked
to
be
directed
at
once
to
where
the
bark
swanhilda
was
taking
on
grain
though
he
had
bought
and
greatly
enlarged
his
new
elevator
at
this
port
he
had
never
seen
it
the
work
had
been
carried
on
through
agents
behrman
having
far
too
many
and
more
pressing
occupations
to
demand
his
presence
and
attention
now
however
he
was
to
see
the
concrete
evidence
of
his
success
for
the
first
time
he
picked
his
way
across
the
railroad
tracks
to
the
line
of
warehouses
that
bordered
the
docks
numbered
with
enormous
roman
numerals
and
full
of
grain
in
bags
the
sight
of
these
bags
of
grain
put
him
in
mind
of
the
fact
that
among
all
the
other
shippers
he
was
practically
alone
in
his
way
of
handling
his
wheat
they
handled
the
grain
in
bags
he
however
preferred
it
in
the
bulk
bags
were
sometimes
four
cents
apiece
and
he
had
decided
to
build
his
elevator
and
bulk
his
grain
therein
rather
than
to
incur
this
expense
only
a
small
part
of
his
wheat
that
on
number
three
division
had
been
sacked
all
the
rest
practically
of
the
entire
harvest
of
los
muertos
now
found
itself
warehoused
in
his
enormous
elevator
at
port
costa
to
a
certain
degree
it
had
been
the
desire
of
observing
the
working
of
his
system
of
handling
the
wheat
in
bulk
that
had
drawn
behrman
to
port
costa
but
the
more
powerful
motive
had
been
curiosity
not
to
say
downright
sentiment
so
long
had
he
planned
for
this
day
of
triumph
so
eagerly
had
he
looked
forward
to
it
that
now
when
it
had
come
he
wished
to
enjoy
it
to
its
fullest
extent
wished
to
miss
no
feature
of
the
disposal
of
the
crop
he
had
watched
it
harvested
he
had
watched
it
hauled
to
the
railway
and
now
would
watch
it
as
it
poured
into
the
hold
of
the
ship
would
even
watch
the
ship
as
she
cleared
and
got
under
way
he
passed
through
the
warehouses
and
came
out
upon
the
dock
that
ran
parallel
with
the
shore
of
the
bay
a
great
quantity
of
shipping
was
in
view
barques
for
the
most
part
cape
horners
great
deep
sea
tramps
whose
forefeet
had
parted
every
ocean
the
world
round
from
rangoon
to
rio
janeiro
and
from
melbourne
to
christiania
some
were
still
in
the
stream
loaded
with
wheat
to
the
plimsoll
mark
ready
to
depart
with
the
next
tide
but
many
others
laid
their
great
flanks
alongside
the
docks
and
at
that
moment
were
being
filled
by
derrick
and
crane
with
thousands
upon
thousands
of
bags
of
wheat
the
scene
was
brisk
the
cranes
creaked
and
swung
incessantly
with
a
rattle
of
chains
stevedores
and
wharfingers
toiled
and
perspired
boatswains
and
shouted
orders
drays
rumbled
the
water
lapped
at
the
piles
a
group
of
sailors
painting
the
flanks
of
one
of
the
great
ships
raised
an
occasional
chanty
the
trade
wind
sang
aeolian
in
the
cordages
filling
the
air
with
the
nimble
taint
of
salt
all
around
were
the
noises
of
ships
and
the
feel
and
flavor
of
the
sea
behrman
soon
discovered
his
elevator
it
was
the
largest
structure
discernible
and
upon
its
red
roof
in
enormous
white
letters
was
his
own
name
thither
between
piles
of
grain
bags
halted
drays
crates
and
boxes
of
merchandise
with
an
occasional
pyramid
of
salmon
cases
behrman
took
his
way
cabled
to
the
dock
close
under
his
elevator
lay
a
great
ship
with
lofty
masts
and
great
spars
her
stern
was
toward
him
as
he
approached
and
upon
it
in
raised
golden
letters
he
could
read
the
words
swanhilda
he
went
aboard
by
a
very
steep
gangway
and
found
the
mate
on
the
quarter
deck
behrman
introduced
himself
well
he
added
how
are
you
getting
on
very
fairly
sir
returned
the
mate
who
was
an
englishman
have
her
all
snugged
down
tight
by
this
time
day
after
a
great
saving
of
time
shunting
the
stuff
in
her
like
that
and
three
men
can
do
the
work
of
i
have
a
look
i
believe
returned
behrman
right
oh
answered
the
mate
with
a
nod
behrman
went
forward
to
the
hatch
that
opened
down
into
the
vast
hold
of
the
ship
a
great
iron
chute
connected
this
hatch
with
the
elevator
and
through
it
was
rushing
a
veritable
cataract
of
wheat
it
came
from
some
gigantic
bin
within
the
elevator
itself
rushing
down
the
confines
of
the
chute
to
plunge
into
the
roomy
gloomy
interior
of
the
hold
with
an
incessant
metallic
roar
persistent
steady
inevitable
no
men
were
in
sight
the
place
was
deserted
no
human
agency
seemed
to
be
back
of
the
movement
of
the
wheat
rather
the
grain
seemed
impelled
with
a
force
of
its
own
a
resistless
huge
force
eager
vivid
impatient
for
the
sea
behrman
stood
watching
his
ears
deafened
with
the
roar
of
the
hard
grains
against
the
metallic
lining
of
the
chute
he
put
his
hand
once
into
the
rushing
tide
and
the
contact
rasped
the
flesh
of
his
fingers
and
like
an
undertow
drew
his
hand
after
it
in
its
impetuous
dash
cautiously
he
peered
down
into
the
hold
a
musty
odour
rose
to
his
nostrils
the
vigorous
pungent
aroma
of
the
raw
cereal
it
was
dark
he
could
see
nothing
but
all
about
and
over
the
opening
of
the
hatch
the
air
was
full
of
a
fine
impalpable
dust
that
blinded
the
eyes
and
choked
the
throat
and
nostrils
as
his
eyes
became
used
to
the
shadows
of
the
cavern
below
him
he
began
to
distinguish
the
grey
mass
of
the
wheat
a
great
expanse
almost
liquid
in
its
texture
which
as
the
cataract
from
above
plunged
into
it
moved
and
shifted
in
long
slow
eddies
as
he
stood
there
this
cataract
on
a
sudden
increased
in
volume
he
turned
about
casting
his
eyes
upward
toward
the
elevator
to
discover
the
cause
his
foot
caught
in
a
coil
of
rope
and
he
fell
headforemost
into
the
hold
the
fall
was
a
long
one
and
he
struck
the
surface
of
the
wheat
with
the
sodden
impact
of
a
bundle
of
damp
clothes
for
the
moment
he
was
stunned
all
the
breath
was
driven
from
his
body
he
could
neither
move
nor
cry
out
but
by
degrees
his
wits
steadied
themselves
and
his
breath
returned
to
him
he
looked
about
and
above
him
the
daylight
in
the
hold
was
dimmed
and
clouded
by
the
thick
thrown
off
by
the
pour
of
grain
and
even
this
dimness
dwindled
to
twilight
at
a
short
distance
from
the
opening
of
the
hatch
while
the
remotest
quarters
were
lost
in
impenetrable
blackness
he
got
upon
his
feet
only
to
find
that
he
sunk
ankle
deep
in
the
loose
packed
mass
underfoot
hell
he
muttered
here
a
directly
underneath
the
chute
the
wheat
as
it
poured
in
raised
itself
in
a
conical
mound
but
from
the
sides
of
this
mound
it
shunted
away
incessantly
in
thick
layers
flowing
in
all
directions
with
the
nimbleness
of
water
even
as
behrman
spoke
a
wave
of
grain
poured
around
his
legs
and
rose
rapidly
to
the
level
of
his
knees
he
stepped
quickly
back
to
stay
near
the
chute
would
soon
bury
him
to
the
waist
no
doubt
there
was
some
other
exit
from
the
hold
some
companion
ladder
that
led
up
to
the
deck
he
scuffled
and
waded
across
the
wheat
groping
in
the
dark
with
outstretched
hands
with
every
inhalation
he
choked
filling
his
mouth
and
nostrils
more
with
dust
than
with
air
at
times
he
could
not
breathe
at
all
but
gagged
and
gasped
his
lips
distended
but
search
as
he
would
he
could
find
no
outlet
to
the
hold
no
stairway
no
companion
ladder
again
and
again
staggering
along
in
the
black
darkness
he
bruised
his
knuckles
and
forehead
against
the
iron
sides
of
the
ship
he
gave
up
the
attempt
to
find
any
interior
means
of
escape
and
returned
laboriously
to
the
space
under
the
open
hatchway
already
he
could
see
that
the
level
of
the
wheat
was
raised
god
he
said
this
is
going
to
do
at
he
uttered
a
great
shout
hello
on
deck
there
somebody
for
god
the
steady
metallic
roar
of
the
pouring
wheat
drowned
out
his
voice
he
could
scarcely
hear
it
himself
above
the
rush
of
the
cataract
besides
this
he
found
it
impossible
to
stay
under
the
hatch
the
flying
grains
of
wheat
spattering
as
they
fell
stung
his
face
like
particles
of
ice
it
was
a
veritable
torture
his
hands
smarted
with
it
once
he
was
all
but
blinded
furthermore
the
succeeding
waves
of
wheat
rolling
from
the
mound
under
the
chute
beat
him
back
swirling
and
dashing
against
his
legs
and
knees
mounting
swiftly
higher
carrying
him
off
his
feet
once
more
he
retreated
drawing
back
from
beneath
the
hatch
he
stood
still
for
a
moment
and
shouted
again
it
was
in
vain
his
voice
returned
upon
him
unable
to
penetrate
the
thunder
of
the
chute
and
horrified
he
discovered
that
so
soon
as
he
stood
motionless
upon
the
wheat
he
sank
into
it
before
he
knew
it
he
was
again
and
a
long
swirl
of
grain
sweeping
outward
from
the
pyramid
below
the
chute
poured
around
his
thighs
immobolising
him
a
frenzy
of
terror
suddenly
leaped
to
life
within
him
the
horror
of
death
the
fear
of
the
trap
shook
him
like
a
dry
reed
shouting
he
tore
himself
free
of
the
wheat
and
once
more
scrambled
and
struggled
towards
the
hatchway
he
stumbled
as
he
reached
it
and
fell
directly
beneath
the
pour
like
a
storm
of
small
shot
mercilessly
pitilessly
the
unnumbered
multitude
of
hurtling
grains
flagellated
and
beat
and
tore
his
flesh
blood
streamed
from
his
forehead
and
thickening
with
the
blinded
his
eyes
he
struggled
to
his
feet
once
more
an
avalanche
from
the
cone
of
wheat
buried
him
to
his
thighs
he
was
forced
back
and
back
and
back
beating
the
air
falling
rising
howling
for
aid
he
could
no
longer
see
his
eyes
crammed
with
dust
smarted
as
if
transfixed
with
needles
whenever
he
opened
them
his
mouth
was
full
of
the
dust
his
lips
were
dry
with
it
thirst
tortured
him
while
his
outcries
choked
and
gagged
in
his
rasped
throat
and
all
the
while
without
stop
incessantly
inexorably
the
wheat
as
if
moving
with
a
force
all
its
own
shot
downward
in
a
prolonged
roar
persistent
steady
inevitable
he
retreated
to
a
far
corner
of
the
hold
and
sat
down
with
his
back
against
the
iron
hull
of
the
ship
and
tried
to
collect
his
thoughts
to
calm
himself
surely
there
must
be
some
way
of
escape
surely
he
was
not
to
die
like
this
die
in
this
dreadful
substance
that
was
neither
solid
nor
fluid
what
was
he
to
do
how
make
himself
heard
but
even
as
he
thought
about
this
the
cone
under
the
chute
broke
again
and
sent
a
great
layer
of
grain
rippling
and
tumbling
toward
him
it
reached
him
where
he
sat
and
buried
his
hand
and
one
foot
he
sprang
up
trembling
and
made
for
another
corner
by
god
he
cried
by
god
i
must
think
of
something
pretty
quick
once
more
the
level
of
the
wheat
rose
and
the
grains
began
piling
deeper
about
him
once
more
he
retreated
once
more
he
crawled
staggering
to
the
foot
of
the
cataract
screaming
till
his
ears
sang
and
his
eyeballs
strained
in
their
sockets
and
once
more
the
relentless
tide
drove
him
back
then
began
that
terrible
dance
of
death
the
man
dodging
doubling
squirming
hunted
from
one
corner
to
another
the
wheat
slowly
inexorably
flowing
rising
spreading
to
every
angle
to
every
nook
and
cranny
it
reached
his
middle
furious
and
with
bleeding
hands
and
broken
nails
he
dug
his
way
out
to
fall
backward
all
but
exhausted
gasping
for
breath
in
the
air
roused
again
by
the
slow
advance
of
the
tide
he
leaped
up
and
stumbled
away
blinded
with
the
agony
in
his
eyes
only
to
crash
against
the
metal
hull
of
the
vessel
he
turned
about
the
blood
streaming
from
his
face
and
paused
to
collect
his
senses
and
with
a
rush
another
wave
swirled
about
his
ankles
and
knees
exhaustion
grew
upon
him
to
stand
still
meant
to
sink
to
lie
or
sit
meant
to
be
buried
the
quicker
and
all
this
in
the
dark
all
this
in
an
air
that
could
scarcely
be
breathed
all
this
while
he
fought
an
enemy
that
could
not
be
gripped
toiling
in
a
sea
that
could
not
be
stayed
guided
by
the
sound
of
the
falling
wheat
behrman
crawled
on
hands
and
knees
toward
the
hatchway
once
more
he
raised
his
voice
in
a
shout
for
help
his
bleeding
throat
and
raw
parched
lips
refused
to
utter
but
a
wheezing
moan
once
more
he
tried
to
look
toward
the
one
patch
of
faint
light
above
him
his
clogged
with
chaff
could
no
longer
open
the
wheat
poured
about
his
waist
as
he
raised
himself
upon
his
knees
reason
fled
deafened
with
the
roar
of
the
grain
blinded
and
made
dumb
with
its
chaff
he
threw
himself
forward
with
clutching
fingers
rolling
upon
his
back
and
lay
there
moving
feebly
the
head
rolling
from
side
to
side
the
wheat
leaping
continuously
from
the
chute
poured
around
him
it
filled
the
pockets
of
the
coat
it
crept
up
the
sleeves
and
trouser
legs
it
covered
the
great
protuberant
stomach
it
ran
at
last
in
rivulets
into
the
distended
gasping
mouth
it
covered
the
face
upon
the
surface
of
the
wheat
under
the
chute
nothing
moved
but
the
wheat
itself
there
was
no
sign
of
life
then
for
an
instant
the
surface
stirred
a
hand
fat
with
short
fingers
and
swollen
veins
reached
up
clutching
then
fell
limp
and
prone
in
another
instant
it
was
covered
in
the
hold
of
the
swanhilda
there
was
no
movement
but
the
widening
ripples
that
spread
flowing
from
the
cone
no
sound
but
the
rushing
of
the
wheat
that
continued
to
plunge
incessantly
from
the
iron
chute
in
a
prolonged
roar
persistent
steady
inevitable
conclusion
the
swanhilda
cast
off
from
the
docks
at
port
costa
two
days
after
presley
had
left
bonneville
and
the
ranches
and
made
her
way
up
to
san
francisco
anchoring
in
the
stream
off
the
city
front
a
few
hours
after
her
arrival
presley
waiting
at
his
club
received
a
despatch
from
cedarquist
to
the
effect
that
she
would
clear
early
the
next
morning
and
that
he
must
be
aboard
of
her
before
midnight
he
sent
his
trunks
aboard
and
at
once
hurried
to
cedarquist
office
to
say
he
found
the
manufacturer
in
excellent
spirits
what
do
you
think
of
lyman
derrick
now

he
said
when
presley
had
sat
down

the
new
politics

a
vengeance
is
he
and
our
own
dear
railroad
openly
acknowledges
him
as
their
candidate
heard
of
his
yes
yes
answered
presley
well
he
knows
his
business
but
cedarquist
was
full
of
another
idea
his
new
venture
the
organizing
of
a
line
of
clipper
wheat
ships
for
pacific
and
oriental
trade

prospering
the

of
her

carry
our
wheat

the
started
from
there
at
the
beginning
of
everything
and
it
manifest
destiny
that
he
must
circle
the
globe
and
fetch
up
where
he
began
his
march

up
with
procession

now
it
may
break
me
but
we
try
it
on
you
know
the
dollar
fair

formally
opened
yesterday
there

he
added
with
a
wink
a
midway
pleasance
in
connection
with

friend

a
to
construct

california
heroic
size

apricots
i
assure
you
he
remarked
with
prodigious
gravity
it
is
a
real
work
of
art
and
quite
a
of
the
fair
well
good
luck
to

out
for
the
men

the
west
the
irrepressible
yank

knocking
at
the
doors
of
their
temples
and
he
will
want

their
harems
and
electric
light
plants
for
their
temple
shrines
to
get
fat
yourself
while
you
about
it
presley
he
observed
as
the
two
stood
up
and
shook
hands
there
should
be
any
lack
of
food
on
a
wheat
ship
bread
enough
little
monotonous
though
can
not
live
by
bread
alone
well
you
really
off
and
as
presley
issued
from
the
building
and
stepped
out
into
the
street
he
was
abruptly
aware
of
a
great
wagon
shrouded
in
white
cloth
inside
of
which
a
bass
drum
was
being
furiously
beaten
on
the
cloth
in
great
letters
were
the
words
vote
for
lyman
derrick
regular
republican
nominee
for
governor
of
the
swanhilda
lifted
and
rolled
slowly
majestically
on
the
ground
swell
of
the
pacific
the
water
hissing
and
boiling
under
her
forefoot
her
cordage
vibrating
and
droning
in
the
steady
rush
of
the
trade
winds
it
was
drawing
towards
evening
and
her
lights
had
just
been
set
the
master
passed
presley
who
was
leaning
over
the
rail
smoking
a
cigarette
and
paused
long
enough
to
remark
the
land
yonder
if
you
can
make
it
out
is
point
gordo
and
if
you
were
to
draw
a
line
from
our
position
now
through
that
point
and
carry
it
on
about
a
hundred
miles
further
it
would
just
about
cross
tulare
county
not
very
far
from
where
you
used
to
i
see
answered
presley
i
see
thanks
i
am
glad
to
know
the
master
passed
on
and
presley
going
up
to
the
quarter
deck
looked
long
and
earnestly
at
the
faint
line
of
mountains
that
showed
vague
and
bluish
above
the
waste
of
tumbling
water
those
were
the
mountains
of
the
coast
range
and
beyond
them
was
what
once
had
been
his
home
bonneville
was
there
and
guadalajara
and
los
muertos
and
quien
sabe
the
mission
of
san
juan
the
seed
ranch
annixter
desolated
home
and
dyke
ruined
well
it
was
all
over
now
that
terrible
drama
through
which
he
had
lived
already
it
was
far
distant
from
him
but
once
again
it
rose
in
his
memory
portentous
sombre
ineffaceable
he
passed
it
all
in
review
from
the
day
of
his
first
meeting
with
vanamee
to
the
day
of
his
parting
with
hilma
he
saw
it
all
the
great
sweep
of
country
opening
to
view
from
the
summit
of
the
hills
at
the
head
waters
of
broderson
creek
the
barn
dance
at
annixter
the
harness
room
with
its
jam
of
furious
men
the
quiet
garden
of
the
mission
dyke
house
his
flight
upon
the
engine
his
brave
fight
in
the
chaparral
lyman
derrick
at
bay
in
the
of
the
ranch
house
the
rabbit
drive
the
fight
at
the
irrigating
ditch
the
shouting
mob
in
the
bonneville
opera
house
the
drama
was
over
the
fight
of
ranch
and
railroad
had
been
wrought
out
to
its
dreadful
close
it
was
true
as
shelgrim
had
said
that
forces
rather
than
men
had
locked
horns
in
that
struggle
but
for
all
that
the
men
of
the
ranch
and
not
the
men
of
the
railroad
had
suffered
into
the
prosperous
valley
into
the
quiet
community
of
farmers
that
galloping
monster
that
terror
of
steel
and
steam
had
burst
shooting
athwart
the
horizons
flinging
the
echo
of
its
thunder
over
all
the
ranches
of
the
valley
leaving
blood
and
destruction
in
its
path
yes
the
railroad
had
prevailed
the
ranches
had
been
seized
in
the
tentacles
of
the
octopus
the
iniquitous
burden
of
extortionate
freight
rates
had
been
imposed
like
a
yoke
of
iron
the
monster
had
killed
harran
had
killed
osterman
had
killed
broderson
had
killed
hooven
it
had
beggared
magnus
and
had
driven
him
to
a
state
of
after
he
had
wrecked
his
honour
in
the
vain
attempt
to
do
evil
that
good
might
come
it
had
enticed
lyman
into
its
toils
to
pluck
from
him
his
manhood
and
his
honesty
corrupting
him
and
poisoning
him
beyond
redemption
it
had
hounded
dyke
from
his
legitimate
employment
and
had
made
of
him
a
highwayman
and
criminal
it
had
cast
forth
hooven
to
starve
to
death
upon
the
city
streets
it
had
driven
minna
to
prostitution
it
had
slain
annixter
at
the
very
moment
when
painfully
and
manfully
he
had
at
last
achieved
his
own
salvation
and
stood
forth
resolved
to
do
right
to
act
unselfishly
and
to
live
for
others
it
had
widowed
hilma
in
the
very
dawn
of
her
happiness
it
had
killed
the
very
babe
within
the
womb
strangling
life
ere
yet
it
had
been
born
stamping
out
the
spark
ordained
by
god
to
burn
through
all
eternity
what
then
was
left
was
there
no
hope
no
outlook
for
the
future
no
rift
in
the
black
curtain
no
glimmer
through
the
night
was
good
to
be
thus
overthrown
was
evil
thus
to
be
strong
and
to
prevail
was
nothing
left
then
suddenly
vanamee
words
came
back
to
his
mind
what
was
the
larger
view
what
contributed
the
greatest
good
to
the
greatest
numbers
what
was
the
full
round
of
the
circle
whose
segment
only
he
beheld
in
the
end
the
ultimate
final
end
of
all
what
was
left
yes
good
issued
from
this
crisis
untouched
unassailable
undefiled
men
motes
in
the
sunshine
perished
were
shot
down
in
the
very
noon
of
life
hearts
were
broken
little
children
started
in
life
lamentably
handicapped
young
girls
were
brought
to
a
life
of
shame
old
women
died
in
the
heart
of
life
for
lack
of
food
in
that
little
isolated
group
of
human
insects
misery
death
and
anguish
spun
like
a
wheel
of
fire
but
the
wheat
remained
untouched
unassailable
undefiled
that
mighty
that
nourisher
of
nations
wrapped
in
nirvanic
calm
indifferent
to
the
human
swarm
gigantic
resistless
moved
onward
in
its
appointed
grooves
through
the
welter
of
blood
at
the
irrigation
ditch
through
the
sham
charity
and
shallow
philanthropy
of
famine
relief
committees
the
great
harvest
of
los
muertos
rolled
like
a
flood
from
the
sierras
to
the
himalayas
to
feed
thousands
of
starving
scarecrows
on
the
barren
plains
of
india
falseness
dies
injustice
and
oppression
in
the
end
of
everything
fade
and
vanish
away
greed
cruelty
selfishness
and
inhumanity
are
the
individual
suffers
but
the
race
goes
on
annixter
dies
but
in
a
far
distant
corner
of
the
world
a
thousand
lives
are
saved
the
larger
view
always
and
through
all
shams
all
wickednesses
discovers
the
truth
that
will
in
the
end
prevail
and
all
things
surely
inevitably
resistlessly
work
together
for
good
