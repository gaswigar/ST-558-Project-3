child
and
the
profound
differences
in
theory
are
never
gratuitous
or
invented
they
grow
out
of
conflicting
elements
in
a
genuine
problem
a
problem
which
is
genuine
just
because
the
elements
taken
as
they
stand
are
conflicting
any
significant
problem
involves
conditions
that
for
the
moment
contradict
each
other
solution
comes
only
by
getting
away
from
the
meaning
of
terms
that
is
already
fixed
upon
and
coming
to
see
the
conditions
from
another
point
of
view
and
hence
in
a
fresh
light
but
this
reconstruction
means
travail
of
thought
easier
than
thinking
with
surrender
of
already
formed
ideas
and
detachment
from
facts
already
learned
is
just
to
stick
by
what
is
already
said
looking
about
for
something
with
which
to
buttress
it
against
attack
thus
sects
arise
schools
of
opinion
each
selects
that
set
of
conditions
that
appeals
to
it
and
then
erects
them
into
a
complete
and
independent
truth
instead
of
treating
them
as
a
factor
in
a
problem
needing
adjustment
the
fundamental
factors
in
the
educative
process
are
an
immature
undeveloped
being
and
certain
social
aims
meanings
values
incarnate
in
the
matured
experience
of
the
adult
the
educative
process
is
the
due
interaction
of
these
forces
such
a
conception
of
each
in
relation
to
the
other
as
facilitates
completest
and
freest
interaction
is
the
essence
of
educational
theory
but
here
comes
the
effort
of
thought
it
is
easier
to
see
the
conditions
in
their
separateness
to
insist
upon
one
at
the
expense
of
the
other
to
make
antagonists
of
them
than
to
discover
a
reality
to
which
each
belongs
the
easy
thing
is
to
seize
upon
something
in
the
nature
of
the
child
or
upon
something
in
the
developed
consciousness
of
the
adult
and
insist
upon
as
the
key
to
the
whole
problem
when
this
happens
a
really
serious
practical
problem
that
of
interaction
is
transformed
into
an
unreal
and
hence
insoluble
theoretic
problem
instead
of
seeing
the
educative
steadily
and
as
a
whole
we
see
conflicting
terms
we
get
the
case
of
the
child
the
curriculum
of
the
individual
nature
social
culture
below
all
other
divisions
in
pedagogic
opinion
lies
this
opposition
the
child
lives
in
a
somewhat
narrow
world
of
personal
contacts
things
hardly
come
within
his
experience
unless
they
touch
intimately
and
obviously
his
own
or
that
of
his
family
and
friends
his
world
is
a
world
of
persons
with
their
personal
interests
rather
than
a
realm
of
facts
and
laws
not
truth
in
the
sense
of
conformity
to
external
fact
but
affection
and
sympathy
is
its
keynote
as
against
this
the
course
of
study
met
in
the
school
presents
material
stretching
back
indefinitely
in
time
and
extending
outward
indefinitely
into
space
the
child
is
taken
out
of
his
familiar
physical
environment
hardly
more
than
a
square
mile
or
so
in
area
into
the
wide
world
yes
and
even
to
the
bounds
of
the
solar
system
his
little
span
of
personal
memory
and
tradition
is
overlaid
with
the
long
centuries
of
the
history
of
all
peoples
again
the
child
life
is
an
integral
a
total
one
he
passes
quickly
and
readily
from
one
topic
to
another
as
from
one
spot
to
another
but
is
not
conscious
of
transition
or
break
there
is
no
conscious
isolation
hardly
conscious
distinction
the
things
that
occupy
him
are
held
together
by
the
unity
of
the
personal
and
social
interests
which
his
life
carries
along
whatever
is
uppermost
in
his
mind
constitutes
to
him
for
the
time
being
the
whole
universe
that
universe
is
fluid
and
fluent
its
contents
dissolve
and
with
amazing
rapidity
but
after
all
it
is
the
child
own
world
it
has
the
unity
and
completeness
of
his
own
life
he
goes
to
school
and
various
studies
divide
and
fractionize
the
world
for
him
geography
selects
it
abstracts
and
analyzes
one
set
of
facts
and
from
one
particular
point
of
view
arithmetic
is
another
division
grammar
another
department
and
so
on
indefinitely
again
in
school
each
of
these
subjects
is
classified
facts
are
torn
away
from
their
original
place
in
experience
and
rearranged
with
reference
to
some
general
principle
classification
is
not
a
matter
of
child
experience
things
do
not
come
to
the
individual
pigeonholed
the
vital
ties
of
affection
the
connecting
bonds
of
activity
hold
together
the
variety
of
his
personal
experiences
the
adult
mind
is
so
familiar
with
the
notion
of
logically
ordered
facts
that
it
does
not
recognize
it
can
not
realize
the
amount
of
separating
and
reformulating
which
the
facts
of
direct
experience
have
to
undergo
before
they
can
appear
as
a
study
or
branch
of
learning
a
principle
for
the
intellect
has
had
to
be
distinguished
and
defined
facts
have
had
to
be
interpreted
in
relation
to
this
principle
not
as
they
are
in
themselves
they
have
had
to
be
regathered
about
a
new
center
which
is
wholly
abstract
and
ideal
all
this
means
a
development
of
a
special
intellectual
interest
it
means
ability
to
view
facts
impartially
and
objectively
that
is
without
reference
to
their
place
and
meaning
in
one
own
experience
it
means
capacity
to
analyze
and
to
synthesize
it
means
highly
matured
intellectual
habits
and
the
command
of
a
definite
technique
and
apparatus
of
scientific
inquiry
the
studies
as
classified
are
the
product
in
a
word
of
the
science
of
the
ages
not
of
the
experience
of
the
child
these
apparent
deviations
and
differences
between
child
and
curriculum
might
be
almost
indefinitely
widened
but
we
have
here
sufficiently
fundamental
divergences
first
the
narrow
but
personal
world
of
the
child
against
the
impersonal
but
infinitely
extended
world
of
space
and
time
second
the
unity
the
single
wholeheartedness
of
the
life
and
the
specializations
and
divisions
of
the
curriculum
third
an
abstract
principle
of
logical
classification
and
arrangement
and
the
practical
and
emotional
bonds
of
child
life
from
these
elements
of
conflict
grow
up
different
educational
sects
one
school
fixes
its
attention
upon
the
importance
of
the
of
the
curriculum
as
compared
with
the
contents
of
the
child
own
experience
it
is
as
if
they
said
is
life
petty
narrow
and
crude
then
studies
reveal
the
great
wide
universe
with
all
its
fulness
and
complexity
of
meaning
is
the
life
of
the
child
egoistic
impulsive
then
in
these
studies
is
found
an
objective
universe
of
truth
law
and
order
is
his
experience
confused
vague
uncertain
at
the
mercy
of
the
moment
caprice
and
circumstance
then
studies
introduce
a
world
arranged
on
the
basis
of
eternal
and
general
truth
a
world
where
all
is
measured
and
defined
hence
the
moral
ignore
and
minimize
the
child
individual
peculiarities
whims
and
experiences
they
are
what
we
need
to
get
away
from
they
are
to
be
obscured
or
eliminated
as
educators
our
work
is
precisely
to
substitute
for
these
superficial
and
casual
affairs
stable
and
realities
and
these
are
found
in
studies
and
lessons
subdivide
each
topic
into
studies
each
study
into
lessons
each
lesson
into
specific
facts
and
formulae
let
the
child
proceed
step
by
step
to
master
each
one
of
these
separate
parts
and
at
last
he
will
have
covered
the
entire
ground
the
road
which
looks
so
long
when
viewed
in
its
entirety
is
easily
traveled
considered
as
a
series
of
particular
steps
thus
emphasis
is
put
upon
the
logical
subdivisions
and
consecutions
of
the
problems
of
instruction
are
problems
of
procuring
texts
giving
logical
parts
and
sequences
and
of
presenting
these
portions
in
class
in
a
similar
definite
and
graded
way
furnishes
the
end
and
it
determines
method
the
child
is
simply
the
immature
being
who
is
to
be
matured
he
is
the
superficial
being
who
is
to
be
deepened
his
is
narrow
experience
which
is
to
be
widened
it
is
his
to
receive
to
accept
his
part
is
fulfilled
when
he
is
ductile
and
docile
not
so
says
the
other
sect
the
child
is
the
the
center
and
the
end
his
development
his
growth
is
the
ideal
it
alone
furnishes
the
standard
to
the
growth
of
the
child
all
studies
are
subservient
they
are
instruments
valued
as
they
serve
the
needs
of
growth
personality
character
is
more
than
not
knowledge
or
information
but
is
the
goal
to
possess
all
the
world
of
knowledge
and
lose
one
own
self
is
as
awful
a
fate
in
education
as
in
religion
moreover
never
can
be
got
into
the
child
from
without
learning
is
active
it
involves
reaching
out
of
the
mind
it
involves
organic
assimilation
starting
from
within
literally
we
must
take
our
stand
with
the
child
and
our
departure
from
him
it
is
he
and
not
the
which
determines
both
quality
and
quantity
of
learning
the
only
significant
method
is
the
method
of
the
mind
as
it
reaches
out
and
assimilates
is
but
spiritual
food
possible
nutritive
material
it
can
not
digest
itself
it
can
not
of
its
own
accord
turn
into
bone
and
muscle
and
blood
the
source
of
whatever
is
dead
mechanical
and
formal
in
schools
is
found
precisely
in
the
subordination
of
the
life
and
experience
of
the
child
to
the
curriculum
it
is
because
of
this
that
study
has
become
a
synonym
for
what
is
irksome
and
a
lesson
identical
with
a
task
this
fundamental
opposition
of
child
and
curriculum
set
up
by
these
two
modes
of
doctrine
can
be
duplicated
in
a
series
of
other
terms
discipline
is
the
watchword
of
those
who
magnify
the
course
of
study
interest
that
of
those
who
blazon
the
child
upon
their
banner
the
standpoint
of
the
former
is
logical
that
of
the
latter
psychological
the
first
emphasizes
the
necessity
of
adequate
training
and
scholarship
on
the
part
of
the
teacher
the
latter
that
of
need
of
sympathy
with
the
child
and
knowledge
of
his
natural
instincts
guidance
and
control
are
the
catchwords
of
one
school
freedom
and
initiative
of
the
other
law
is
asserted
here
spontaneity
proclaimed
there
the
old
the
conservation
of
what
has
been
achieved
in
the
pain
and
toil
of
the
ages
is
dear
to
the
one
the
new
change
progress
wins
the
affection
of
the
other
inertness
and
routine
chaos
and
anarchism
are
accusations
bandied
back
and
forth
neglect
of
the
sacred
authority
of
duty
is
charged
by
one
side
only
to
be
met
by
of
suppression
of
individuality
through
tyrannical
despotism
such
oppositions
are
rarely
carried
to
their
logical
conclusion
recoils
at
the
extreme
character
of
these
results
they
are
left
to
theorists
while
vibrates
back
and
forward
in
a
maze
of
inconsistent
compromise
the
need
of
getting
theory
and
practical
into
closer
connection
suggests
a
return
to
our
original
thesis
that
we
have
here
conditions
which
are
necessarily
related
to
each
other
in
the
educative
process
since
this
is
precisely
one
of
interaction
and
adjustment
what
then
is
the
problem
it
is
just
to
get
rid
of
the
prejudicial
notion
that
there
is
some
gap
in
kind
as
distinct
from
degree
between
the
child
experience
and
the
various
forms
of
that
make
up
the
course
of
study
from
the
side
of
the
child
it
is
a
question
of
seeing
how
his
experience
already
contains
within
itself
elements
facts
and
truths
of
just
the
same
sort
as
those
entering
into
the
formulated
study
and
what
is
of
more
importance
of
how
it
contains
within
itself
the
attitudes
the
motives
and
the
interests
which
have
operated
in
developing
and
organizing
the
to
the
plane
which
it
now
occupies
from
the
side
of
the
studies
it
is
a
question
of
interpreting
them
as
outgrowths
of
forces
operating
in
the
child
life
and
of
discovering
the
steps
that
intervene
between
the
child
present
experience
and
their
richer
maturity
abandon
the
notion
of
as
something
fixed
and
in
itself
outside
the
child
experience
cease
thinking
of
the
experience
as
also
something
hard
and
fast
see
it
as
something
fluent
embryonic
vital
and
we
realize
that
the
child
and
the
curriculum
are
simply
two
limits
which
define
a
single
process
just
as
two
points
define
a
straight
line
so
the
present
standpoint
of
the
child
and
the
facts
and
truths
of
studies
define
instruction
it
is
continuous
reconstruction
moving
from
the
child
present
experience
out
into
that
represented
by
the
organized
bodies
of
truth
that
we
call
studies
on
the
face
of
it
the
various
studies
arithmetic
geography
language
botany
are
themselves
experience
they
are
that
of
the
race
they
embody
the
cumulative
outcome
of
the
efforts
the
strivings
and
the
successes
of
the
human
race
generation
after
generation
they
present
this
not
as
a
mere
accumulation
not
as
a
miscellaneous
heap
of
separate
bits
of
experience
but
in
some
organized
and
systematized
way
that
is
as
reflectively
formulated
hence
the
facts
and
truths
that
enter
into
the
child
present
experience
and
those
contained
in
the
of
studies
are
the
initial
and
final
terms
of
one
reality
to
oppose
one
to
the
other
is
to
oppose
the
infancy
and
maturity
of
the
same
growing
life
it
is
to
set
the
moving
tendency
and
the
final
result
of
the
same
process
over
against
each
other
it
is
to
hold
that
the
nature
and
the
destiny
of
the
child
war
with
each
other
if
such
be
the
case
the
problem
of
the
relation
of
the
child
and
the
curriculum
presents
itself
in
this
guise
of
what
use
educationally
speaking
is
it
to
be
able
to
see
the
end
in
the
beginning
how
does
it
assist
us
in
dealing
with
the
early
stages
of
growth
to
be
able
to
anticipate
its
later
phases
the
studies
as
we
have
agreed
represent
the
possibilities
of
development
inherent
in
the
child
immediate
crude
experience
but
after
all
they
are
not
parts
of
that
present
and
immediate
life
why
then
or
how
make
account
of
them
asking
such
a
question
suggests
its
own
answer
to
see
the
outcome
is
to
know
in
what
direction
the
present
experience
is
moving
provided
it
move
normally
and
soundly
the
point
which
is
of
no
significance
to
us
simply
as
far
away
becomes
of
huge
importance
the
moment
we
take
it
as
defining
a
present
direction
of
movement
taken
in
this
way
it
is
no
remote
and
distant
result
to
be
achieved
but
a
guiding
method
in
dealing
with
the
present
the
systematized
and
defined
experience
of
the
adult
mind
in
other
words
is
of
value
to
us
in
interpreting
the
child
life
as
it
immediately
shows
itself
and
in
passing
on
to
guidance
or
direction
let
us
look
for
a
moment
at
these
two
ideas
interpretation
and
guidance
the
child
present
experience
is
in
no
way
it
is
not
final
but
transitional
it
is
nothing
complete
in
itself
but
just
a
sign
or
index
of
certain
as
long
as
we
confine
our
gaze
to
what
the
child
here
and
now
puts
forth
we
are
confused
and
misled
we
can
not
read
its
meaning
extreme
depreciations
of
the
child
morally
and
intellectually
and
sentimental
idealizations
of
him
have
their
root
in
a
common
fallacy
both
spring
from
taking
stages
of
a
growth
or
movement
as
something
cut
off
and
fixed
the
first
fails
to
see
the
promise
contained
in
feelings
and
deeds
which
taken
by
themselves
are
uncompromising
and
repellent
the
second
fails
to
see
that
even
the
most
pleasing
and
beautiful
exhibitions
are
but
signs
and
that
they
begin
to
spoil
and
rot
the
moment
they
are
treated
as
achievements
what
we
need
is
something
which
will
enable
us
to
interpret
to
appraise
the
elements
in
the
child
present
puttings
forth
and
fallings
away
his
exhibitions
of
power
and
weakness
in
the
light
of
some
larger
in
which
they
have
their
place
only
in
this
way
can
we
discriminate
if
we
isolate
the
child
present
inclinations
purposes
and
experiences
from
the
place
they
occupy
and
the
part
they
have
to
perform
in
a
developing
experience
all
stand
upon
the
same
level
all
alike
are
equally
good
and
equally
bad
but
in
the
movement
of
life
different
elements
stand
upon
different
planes
of
value
some
of
the
child
deeds
are
symptoms
of
a
waning
tendency
they
are
survivals
in
functioning
of
an
organ
which
has
done
its
part
and
is
passing
out
of
vital
use
to
give
positive
attention
to
such
qualities
is
to
arrest
development
upon
a
lower
level
it
is
systematically
to
maintain
a
rudimentary
phase
of
growth
other
activities
are
signs
of
a
culminating
power
and
interest
to
them
applies
the
maxim
of
striking
while
the
iron
is
hot
as
regards
them
it
is
perhaps
a
matter
of
now
or
never
selected
utilized
emphasized
they
may
mark
a
for
good
in
the
child
whole
career
neglected
an
opportunity
goes
never
to
be
recalled
other
acts
and
feelings
are
prophetic
they
represent
the
dawning
of
flickering
light
that
will
shine
steadily
only
in
the
far
future
as
regards
them
there
is
little
at
present
to
do
but
give
them
fair
and
full
chance
waiting
for
the
future
for
definite
direction
just
as
upon
the
whole
it
was
the
weakness
of
the
old
education
that
it
made
invidious
comparisons
between
the
immaturity
of
the
child
and
the
maturity
of
the
adult
regarding
the
former
as
something
to
be
got
away
from
as
soon
as
possible
and
as
much
as
possible
so
it
is
the
danger
of
the
new
education
that
it
regard
the
child
present
powers
and
interests
as
something
finally
significant
in
themselves
in
truth
his
learnings
and
achievements
are
fluid
and
moving
they
change
from
day
to
day
and
from
hour
to
hour
it
will
do
harm
if
leave
in
the
popular
mind
the
impression
that
a
child
of
a
given
age
has
a
positive
equipment
of
purposes
and
interests
to
be
cultivated
just
as
they
stand
interests
in
reality
are
but
attitudes
toward
possible
experiences
they
are
not
achievements
their
worth
is
in
the
leverage
they
afford
not
in
the
accomplishment
they
represent
to
take
the
phenomena
presented
at
a
given
age
as
in
any
way
or
is
inevitably
to
result
in
indulgence
and
spoiling
any
power
whether
of
child
or
adult
is
indulged
when
it
is
taken
on
its
given
and
present
level
in
consciousness
its
genuine
meaning
is
in
the
propulsion
it
affords
toward
a
higher
level
it
is
just
something
to
do
with
appealing
to
the
interest
upon
the
present
plane
means
excitation
it
means
playing
with
a
power
so
as
continually
to
stir
it
up
without
directing
it
toward
definite
achievement
continuous
initiation
continuous
starting
of
activities
that
do
not
arrive
is
for
all
practical
purposes
as
bad
as
the
continual
repression
of
initiative
in
conformity
with
supposed
interests
of
some
more
perfect
thought
or
will
it
is
as
if
the
child
were
forever
tasting
and
never
eating
always
having
his
palate
tickled
upon
the
emotional
side
but
never
getting
the
organic
satisfaction
that
comes
only
with
digestion
of
food
and
transformation
of
it
into
working
power
as
against
such
a
view
the
of
science
and
history
and
art
serves
to
reveal
the
real
child
to
us
we
do
not
know
the
meaning
either
of
his
tendencies
or
of
his
performances
excepting
as
we
take
them
as
germinating
seed
or
opening
bud
of
some
fruit
to
be
borne
the
whole
world
of
visual
nature
is
all
too
small
an
answer
to
the
problem
of
the
meaning
of
the
child
instinct
for
light
and
form
the
entire
science
of
physics
is
none
too
much
to
interpret
adequately
to
us
what
is
involved
in
some
simple
demand
of
the
child
for
explanation
of
some
casual
change
that
has
attracted
his
attention
the
art
of
raphael
or
of
corot
is
none
too
much
to
enable
us
to
value
the
impulses
stirring
in
the
child
when
he
draws
and
daubs
so
much
for
the
use
of
the
in
interpretation
its
further
employment
in
direction
or
guidance
is
but
an
expansion
of
the
same
thought
to
interpret
the
fact
is
to
see
it
in
its
vital
movement
to
see
it
in
its
relation
to
growth
but
to
view
it
as
a
part
of
a
normal
growth
is
to
secure
the
basis
for
guiding
it
guidance
is
not
external
imposition
is
freeing
the
for
its
own
most
adequate
what
was
said
about
disregard
of
the
child
present
experience
because
of
its
remoteness
from
mature
experience
and
of
the
sentimental
idealization
of
the
child
naïve
caprices
and
performances
may
be
repeated
here
with
slightly
altered
phrase
there
are
those
who
see
no
alternative
between
forcing
the
child
from
without
or
leaving
him
entirely
alone
seeing
no
alternative
some
choose
one
mode
some
another
both
fall
into
the
same
fundamental
error
both
fail
to
see
that
development
is
a
definite
process
having
its
own
law
which
can
be
fulfilled
only
when
adequate
and
normal
conditions
are
provided
really
to
interpret
the
child
present
crude
impulses
in
counting
measuring
and
arranging
things
in
rhythmic
series
involves
mathematical
scholarship
a
knowledge
of
the
mathematical
formulae
and
relations
which
have
in
the
history
of
the
race
grown
out
of
just
such
crude
beginnings
to
see
the
whole
history
of
development
which
intervenes
between
these
two
terms
is
simply
to
see
what
step
the
child
needs
to
take
just
here
and
now
to
what
use
he
needs
to
put
his
blind
impulse
in
order
that
it
may
get
clarity
and
gain
force
if
once
more
the
old
education
tended
to
ignore
the
dynamic
quality
the
developing
force
inherent
in
the
child
present
experience
and
therefore
to
assume
that
direction
and
control
were
just
matters
of
arbitrarily
putting
the
child
in
a
given
path
and
compelling
him
to
walk
there
the
new
education
is
in
danger
of
taking
the
idea
of
development
in
altogether
too
formal
and
empty
a
way
the
child
is
expected
to
develop
this
or
that
fact
or
truth
out
of
his
own
mind
he
is
told
to
think
things
out
or
work
things
out
for
himself
without
being
supplied
any
of
the
environing
conditions
which
are
requisite
to
start
and
guide
thought
nothing
can
be
developed
from
nothing
nothing
but
the
crude
can
be
developed
out
of
the
crude
and
this
is
what
surely
happens
when
we
throw
the
child
back
upon
his
achieved
self
as
a
finality
and
invite
him
to
spin
new
truths
of
nature
or
of
conduct
out
of
that
it
is
certainly
as
futile
to
expect
a
child
to
evolve
a
universe
out
of
his
own
mere
mind
as
it
is
for
a
philosopher
to
attempt
that
task
development
does
not
mean
just
getting
something
out
of
the
mind
it
is
a
development
of
experience
and
into
experience
that
is
really
wanted
and
this
is
impossible
save
as
just
that
educative
medium
is
provided
which
will
enable
the
powers
and
interests
that
have
been
selected
as
valuable
to
function
they
must
operate
and
how
they
operate
will
depend
almost
entirely
upon
the
stimuli
which
surround
them
and
the
material
upon
which
they
exercise
themselves
the
problem
of
direction
is
thus
the
problem
of
selecting
appropriate
stimuli
for
instincts
and
impulses
which
it
is
desired
to
employ
in
the
gaining
of
new
experience
what
new
experiences
are
desirable
and
thus
what
stimuli
are
needed
it
is
impossible
to
tell
except
as
there
is
some
comprehension
of
the
development
which
is
aimed
at
except
in
a
word
as
the
adult
knowledge
is
drawn
upon
as
revealing
the
possible
career
open
to
the
child
it
may
be
of
use
to
distinguish
and
to
relate
to
each
other
the
logical
and
the
psychological
aspects
of
experience
the
former
standing
for
in
itself
the
latter
for
it
in
relation
to
the
child
a
psychological
statement
of
experience
follows
its
actual
growth
it
is
historic
it
notes
steps
actually
taken
the
uncertain
and
tortuous
as
well
as
the
efficient
and
successful
the
logical
point
of
view
on
the
other
hand
assumes
that
the
development
has
reached
a
certain
positive
stage
of
fulfilment
it
neglects
the
process
and
considers
the
outcome
it
summarizes
and
arranges
and
thus
separates
the
achieved
results
from
the
actual
steps
by
which
they
were
forthcoming
in
the
first
instance
we
may
compare
the
difference
between
the
logical
and
the
psychological
to
the
difference
between
the
notes
which
an
explorer
makes
in
a
new
country
blazing
a
trail
and
finding
his
way
along
as
best
he
may
and
the
finished
map
that
is
constructed
after
the
country
has
been
thoroughly
explored
the
two
are
mutually
dependent
without
the
more
or
less
accidental
and
devious
paths
traced
by
the
explorer
there
would
be
no
facts
which
could
be
utilized
in
the
making
of
the
complete
and
related
chart
but
no
one
would
get
the
benefit
of
the
explorer
trip
if
it
was
not
compared
and
checked
up
with
similar
wanderings
undertaken
by
others
unless
the
new
geographical
facts
learned
the
streams
crossed
the
mountains
climbed
were
viewed
not
as
mere
incidents
in
the
journey
of
the
particular
traveler
but
quite
apart
from
the
individual
explorer
life
in
relation
to
other
similar
facts
already
known
the
map
orders
individual
experiences
connecting
them
with
one
another
irrespective
of
the
local
and
temporal
circumstances
and
accidents
of
their
original
discovery
of
what
use
is
this
formulated
statement
of
experience
of
what
use
is
the
map
well
we
may
first
tell
what
the
map
is
not
the
map
is
not
a
substitute
for
a
personal
experience
the
map
does
not
take
the
place
of
an
actual
journey
the
logically
formulated
material
of
a
science
or
branch
of
learning
of
a
study
is
no
substitute
for
the
having
of
individual
experiences
the
mathematical
formula
for
a
falling
body
does
not
take
the
place
of
personal
contact
and
immediate
individual
experience
with
the
falling
thing
but
the
map
a
summary
an
arranged
and
orderly
view
of
previous
experiences
serves
as
a
guide
to
future
experience
it
gives
direction
it
facilitates
control
it
economizes
effort
preventing
useless
wandering
and
pointing
out
the
paths
which
lead
most
quickly
and
most
certainly
to
a
desired
result
through
the
map
every
new
traveler
may
get
for
his
own
journey
the
benefits
of
the
results
of
others
explorations
without
the
waste
of
energy
and
loss
of
time
involved
in
their
wanderings
wanderings
which
he
himself
would
be
obliged
to
repeat
were
it
not
for
just
the
assistance
of
the
objective
and
generalized
record
of
their
performances
that
which
we
call
a
science
or
study
puts
the
net
product
of
past
experience
in
the
form
which
makes
it
most
available
for
the
future
it
represents
a
capitalization
which
may
at
once
be
turned
to
interest
it
economizes
the
workings
of
the
mind
in
every
way
memory
is
less
taxed
because
the
facts
are
grouped
together
about
some
common
principle
instead
of
being
connected
solely
with
the
varying
incidents
of
their
original
discovery
observation
is
assisted
we
know
what
to
look
for
and
where
to
look
it
is
the
difference
between
looking
for
a
needle
in
a
haystack
and
searching
for
a
given
paper
in
a
cabinet
reasoning
is
directed
because
there
is
a
certain
general
path
or
line
laid
out
along
which
ideas
naturally
march
instead
of
moving
from
one
chance
association
to
another
there
is
then
nothing
final
about
a
logical
rendering
of
experience
its
value
is
not
contained
in
itself
its
significance
is
that
of
standpoint
outlook
method
it
intervenes
between
the
more
casual
tentative
and
roundabout
experiences
of
the
past
and
more
controlled
and
orderly
experiences
of
the
future
it
gives
past
experience
in
that
net
form
which
renders
it
most
available
and
most
significant
most
fecund
for
future
experience
the
abstractions
generalizations
and
classifications
which
it
introduces
all
have
prospective
meaning
the
formulated
result
is
then
not
to
be
opposed
to
the
process
of
growth
the
logical
is
not
set
over
against
the
psychological
the
surveyed
and
arranged
result
occupies
a
critical
position
in
the
process
of
growth
it
marks
a
it
shows
how
we
may
get
the
benefit
of
past
effort
in
controlling
future
endeavor
in
the
largest
sense
the
logical
standpoint
is
itself
psychological
it
has
its
meaning
as
a
point
in
the
development
of
experience
and
its
justification
is
in
its
functioning
in
the
future
growth
which
it
insures
hence
the
need
of
reinstating
into
experience
the
of
the
studies
or
branches
of
learning
it
must
be
restored
to
the
experience
from
which
it
has
been
abstracted
it
needs
to
be
turned
over
translated
into
the
immediate
and
individual
experiencing
within
which
it
has
its
origin
and
significance
every
study
or
subject
thus
has
two
aspects
one
for
the
scientist
as
a
scientist
the
other
for
the
teacher
as
a
teacher
these
two
aspects
are
in
no
sense
opposed
or
conflicting
but
neither
are
they
immediately
identical
for
the
scientist
the
represents
simply
a
given
body
of
truth
to
be
employed
in
locating
new
problems
instituting
new
researches
and
carrying
them
through
to
a
verified
outcome
to
him
the
of
the
science
is
he
refers
various
portions
of
it
to
each
other
he
connects
new
facts
with
it
he
is
not
as
a
scientist
called
upon
to
travel
outside
its
particular
bounds
if
he
does
it
is
only
to
get
more
facts
of
the
same
general
sort
the
problem
of
the
teacher
is
a
different
one
as
a
teacher
he
is
not
concerned
with
adding
new
facts
to
the
science
he
teaches
in
propounding
new
hypotheses
or
in
verifying
them
he
is
concerned
with
the
of
the
science
as
a
given
stage
and
phase
of
the
development
of
his
problem
is
that
of
inducing
a
vital
and
personal
experiencing
hence
what
concerns
him
as
teacher
is
the
ways
in
which
that
subject
may
become
a
part
of
experience
what
there
is
in
the
child
present
that
is
usable
with
reference
to
it
how
such
elements
are
to
be
used
how
his
own
knowledge
of
the
may
assist
in
interpreting
the
child
needs
and
doings
and
determine
the
medium
in
which
the
child
should
be
placed
in
order
that
his
growth
may
be
properly
directed
he
is
concerned
not
with
the
as
such
but
with
the
as
a
related
factor
in
a
total
and
growing
experience
thus
to
see
it
is
to
psychologize
it
it
is
the
failure
to
keep
in
mind
the
double
aspect
of
which
causes
the
curriculum
and
child
to
be
set
over
against
each
other
as
described
in
our
early
pages
the
just
as
it
is
for
the
scientist
has
no
direct
relationship
to
the
child
present
experience
it
stands
outside
of
it
the
danger
here
is
not
a
merely
theoretical
one
we
are
practically
threatened
on
all
sides
textbook
and
teacher
vie
with
each
other
in
presenting
to
the
child
the
as
it
stands
to
the
specialist
such
modification
and
revision
as
it
undergoes
are
a
mere
elimination
of
certain
scientific
difficulties
and
the
general
reduction
to
a
lower
intellectual
level
the
material
is
not
translated
into
but
is
directly
offered
as
a
substitute
for
or
an
external
annex
to
the
child
present
life
three
typical
evils
result
in
the
first
place
the
lack
of
any
organic
connection
with
what
the
child
has
already
seen
and
felt
and
loved
makes
the
material
purely
formal
and
symbolic
there
is
a
sense
in
which
it
is
impossible
to
value
too
highly
the
formal
and
the
symbolic
the
genuine
form
the
real
symbol
serve
as
methods
in
the
holding
and
discovery
of
truth
they
are
tools
by
which
the
individual
pushes
out
most
surely
and
widely
into
unexplored
areas
they
are
means
by
which
he
brings
to
bear
whatever
of
reality
he
has
succeeded
in
gaining
in
past
searchings
but
this
happens
only
when
the
symbol
really
symbolizes
when
it
stands
for
and
sums
up
in
shorthand
actual
experiences
which
the
individual
has
already
gone
through
a
symbol
which
is
induced
from
without
which
has
not
been
led
up
to
in
preliminary
activities
is
as
we
say
a
or
symbol
it
is
dead
and
barren
now
any
fact
whether
of
arithmetic
or
geography
or
grammar
which
is
not
led
up
to
and
into
out
of
something
which
has
previously
occupied
a
significant
position
in
the
child
life
for
its
own
sake
is
forced
into
this
position
it
is
not
a
reality
but
just
the
sign
of
a
reality
which
be
experienced
if
certain
conditions
were
fulfilled
but
the
abrupt
presentation
of
the
fact
as
something
known
by
others
and
requiring
only
to
be
studied
and
learned
by
the
child
rules
out
such
conditions
of
fulfilment
it
condemns
the
fact
to
be
a
hieroglyph
it
would
mean
something
if
one
only
had
the
key
the
clue
being
lacking
it
remains
an
idle
curiosity
to
fret
and
obstruct
the
mind
a
dead
weight
to
burden
it
the
second
evil
in
this
external
presentation
is
lack
of
motivation
there
are
not
only
no
facts
or
truths
which
have
been
previously
felt
as
such
with
which
to
appropriate
and
assimilate
the
new
but
there
is
no
craving
no
need
no
demand
when
the
has
been
psychologized
that
is
viewed
as
an
of
present
tendencies
and
activities
it
is
easy
to
locate
in
the
present
some
obstacle
intellectual
practical
or
ethical
which
can
be
handled
more
adequately
if
the
truth
in
question
be
mastered
this
need
supplies
motive
for
the
learning
an
end
which
is
the
child
own
carries
him
on
to
possess
the
means
of
its
accomplishment
but
when
material
is
directly
supplied
in
the
form
of
a
lesson
to
be
learned
as
a
lesson
the
connecting
links
of
need
and
aim
are
conspicuous
for
their
absence
what
we
mean
by
the
mechanical
and
dead
in
instruction
is
a
result
of
this
lack
of
motivation
the
organic
and
vital
mean
interaction
they
mean
play
of
mental
demand
and
material
supply
the
third
evil
is
that
even
the
most
scientific
matter
arranged
in
most
logical
fashion
loses
this
quality
when
presented
in
external
fashion
by
the
time
it
gets
to
the
child
it
has
to
undergo
some
modification
in
order
to
shut
out
some
phases
too
hard
to
grasp
and
to
reduce
some
of
the
attendant
difficulties
what
happens
those
things
which
are
most
significant
to
the
scientific
man
and
most
valuable
in
the
logic
of
actual
inquiry
and
classification
drop
out
the
really
character
is
obscured
and
the
organizing
function
disappears
or
as
we
commonly
say
the
child
reasoning
powers
the
faculty
of
abstraction
and
generalization
are
not
adequately
developed
so
the
is
evacuated
of
its
logical
value
and
though
it
is
what
it
is
only
from
the
logical
standpoint
is
presented
as
stuff
only
for
memory
this
is
the
contradiction
the
child
gets
the
advantage
neither
of
the
adult
logical
formulation
nor
of
his
own
native
competencies
of
apprehension
and
response
hence
the
logic
of
the
child
is
hampered
and
mortified
and
we
are
almost
fortunate
if
he
does
not
get
actual
flat
and
residua
of
what
was
gaining
scientific
vitality
a
generation
or
two
ago
degenerate
reminiscence
of
what
someone
else
once
formulated
on
the
basis
of
the
experience
that
some
further
person
had
once
upon
a
time
experienced
the
train
of
evils
does
not
cease
it
is
all
too
common
for
opposed
erroneous
theories
to
play
straight
into
each
other
hands
psychological
considerations
may
be
slurred
or
shoved
one
side
they
can
not
be
crowded
out
put
out
of
the
door
they
come
back
through
the
window
somehow
and
somewhere
motive
must
be
appealed
to
connection
must
be
established
between
the
mind
and
its
material
there
is
no
question
of
getting
along
without
this
bond
of
connection
the
only
question
is
whether
it
be
such
as
grows
out
of
the
material
itself
in
relation
to
the
mind
or
be
imported
and
hitched
on
from
some
outside
source
if
the
of
the
lessons
be
such
as
to
have
an
appropriate
place
within
the
expanding
consciousness
of
the
child
if
it
grows
out
of
his
own
past
doings
thinkings
and
sufferings
and
grows
into
application
in
further
achievements
and
receptivities
then
no
device
or
trick
of
method
has
to
be
resorted
to
in
order
to
enlist
interest
the
psychologized
of
interest
that
is
it
is
placed
in
the
whole
of
conscious
life
so
that
it
shares
the
worth
of
that
life
but
the
externally
presented
material
conceived
and
generated
in
standpoints
and
attitudes
remote
from
the
child
and
developed
in
motives
alien
to
him
has
no
such
place
of
its
own
hence
the
recourse
to
adventitious
leverage
to
push
it
in
to
factitious
drill
to
drive
it
in
to
artificial
bribe
to
lure
it
in
three
aspects
of
this
recourse
to
outside
ways
for
giving
the
some
psychological
meaning
may
be
worth
mentioning
familiarity
breeds
contempt
but
it
also
breeds
something
like
affection
we
get
used
to
the
chains
we
wear
and
we
miss
them
when
removed
is
an
old
story
that
through
custom
we
finally
embrace
what
at
first
wore
a
hideous
mien
unpleasant
because
meaningless
activities
may
get
agreeable
if
long
enough
persisted
in
is
possible
for
the
mind
to
develop
interest
in
a
routine
or
mechanical
procedure
if
conditions
are
continually
supplied
which
demand
that
mode
of
operation
and
preclude
any
other
i
frequently
hear
dulling
devices
and
empty
exercises
defended
and
extolled
because
the
children
take
such
an
in
them
yes
that
is
the
worst
of
it
the
mind
shut
out
from
worthy
employ
and
missing
the
taste
of
adequate
performance
comes
down
to
the
level
of
that
which
is
left
to
it
to
know
and
do
and
perforce
takes
an
interest
in
a
cabined
and
cramped
experience
to
find
satisfaction
in
its
own
exercise
is
the
normal
law
of
mind
and
if
large
and
meaningful
business
for
the
mind
be
denied
it
tries
to
content
itself
with
the
formal
movements
that
remain
to
it
and
too
often
succeeds
save
in
those
cases
of
more
intense
activity
which
can
not
accommodate
themselves
and
that
make
up
the
unruly
and
of
our
school
product
an
interest
in
the
formal
apprehension
of
symbols
and
in
their
memorized
reproduction
becomes
in
many
pupils
a
substitute
for
the
original
and
vital
interest
in
reality
and
all
because
the
of
the
course
of
study
being
out
of
relation
to
the
concrete
mind
of
the
individual
some
substitute
bond
to
hold
it
in
some
kind
of
working
relation
to
the
mind
must
be
discovered
and
elaborated
the
second
substitute
for
living
motivation
in
the
is
that
of
the
material
of
the
lesson
is
rendered
interesting
if
not
in
itself
at
least
in
contrast
with
some
alternative
experience
to
learn
the
lesson
is
more
interesting
than
to
take
a
scolding
be
held
up
to
general
ridicule
stay
after
school
receive
degradingly
low
marks
or
fail
to
be
promoted
and
very
much
of
what
goes
by
the
name
of
discipline
and
prides
itself
upon
opposing
the
doctrines
of
a
soft
pedagogy
and
upon
upholding
the
banner
of
effort
and
duty
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
just
this
appeal
to
interest
in
its
obverse
aspect
to
fear
to
dislike
of
various
kinds
of
physical
social
and
personal
pain
the
does
not
appeal
it
can
not
appeal
it
lacks
origin
and
bearing
in
a
growing
experience
so
the
appeal
is
to
the
thousand
and
one
outside
and
irrelevant
agencies
which
may
serve
to
throw
by
sheer
rebuff
and
rebound
the
mind
back
upon
the
material
from
which
it
is
constantly
wandering
human
nature
being
what
it
is
however
it
tends
to
seek
its
motivation
in
the
agreeable
rather
than
in
the
disagreeable
in
direct
pleasure
rather
than
in
alternative
pain
and
so
has
come
up
the
modern
theory
and
practice
of
the
interesting
in
the
false
sense
of
that
term
the
material
is
still
left
so
far
as
its
own
characteristics
are
concerned
just
material
externally
selected
and
formulated
it
is
still
just
so
much
geography
and
arithmetic
and
grammar
study
not
so
much
potentiality
of
with
regard
to
language
earth
and
numbered
and
measured
reality
hence
the
difficulty
of
bringing
the
mind
to
bear
upon
it
hence
its
repulsiveness
the
tendency
for
attention
to
wander
for
other
acts
and
images
to
crowd
in
and
expel
the
lesson
the
legitimate
way
out
is
to
transform
the
material
to
psychologize
it
that
is
once
more
to
take
it
and
to
develop
it
within
the
range
and
scope
of
the
child
life
but
it
is
easier
and
simpler
to
leave
it
as
it
is
and
then
by
trick
of
method
to
interest
to
it
to
cover
it
with
to
conceal
its
barrenness
by
intermediate
and
unrelated
material
and
finally
as
it
were
to
get
the
child
to
swallow
and
digest
the
unpalatable
morsel
while
he
is
enjoying
tasting
something
quite
different
but
alas
for
the
analogy
mental
assimilation
is
a
matter
of
consciousness
and
if
the
attention
has
not
been
playing
upon
the
actual
material
that
has
not
been
apprehended
nor
worked
into
faculty
how
then
stands
the
case
of
child
curriculum
what
shall
the
verdict
be
the
radical
fallacy
in
the
original
pleadings
with
which
we
set
out
is
the
supposition
that
we
have
no
choice
save
either
to
leave
the
child
to
his
own
unguided
spontaneity
or
to
inspire
direction
upon
him
from
without
action
is
response
it
is
adaptation
adjustment
there
is
no
such
thing
as
sheer
possible
because
all
activity
takes
place
in
a
medium
in
a
situation
and
with
reference
to
its
conditions
but
again
no
such
thing
as
imposition
of
truth
from
without
as
insertion
of
truth
from
without
is
possible
all
depends
upon
the
activity
which
the
mind
itself
undergoes
in
responding
to
what
is
presented
from
without
now
the
value
of
the
formulated
wealth
of
knowledge
that
makes
up
the
course
of
study
is
that
it
may
enable
the
educator
to
the
environment
of
the
and
thus
by
indirection
to
direct
its
primary
value
its
primary
indication
is
for
the
teacher
not
for
the
child
it
says
to
the
teacher
such
and
such
are
the
capacities
the
fulfilments
in
truth
and
beauty
and
behavior
open
to
these
children
now
see
to
it
that
day
by
day
the
conditions
are
such
that
own
move
inevitably
in
this
direction
toward
such
culmination
of
themselves
let
the
child
nature
fulfil
its
own
destiny
revealed
to
you
in
whatever
of
science
and
art
and
industry
the
world
now
holds
as
its
own
the
case
is
of
child
it
is
his
present
powers
which
are
to
assert
themselves
his
present
capacities
which
are
to
be
exercised
his
present
attitudes
which
are
to
be
realized
but
save
as
the
teacher
knows
knows
wisely
and
thoroughly
the
which
is
embodied
in
that
thing
we
call
the
curriculum
the
teacher
knows
neither
what
the
present
power
capacity
or
attitude
is
nor
yet
how
it
is
to
be
asserted
exercised
and
realized
