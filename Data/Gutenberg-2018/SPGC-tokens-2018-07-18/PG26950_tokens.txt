the
humorous
ghost
introduction
the
humorous
ghost
is
distinctly
a
modern
character
in
early
literature
wraiths
took
themselves
very
seriously
and
insisted
on
a
proper
show
of
respectful
fear
on
the
part
of
those
whom
they
honored
by
haunting
a
mortal
was
expected
to
rise
when
a
ghost
entered
the
room
and
in
case
he
was
slow
about
it
his
spine
gave
notice
of
what
etiquette
demanded
in
the
event
of
outdoor
apparition
if
a
man
failed
to
bare
his
head
in
awe
the
roots
of
his
hair
reminded
him
of
his
remissness
woman
has
always
had
the
advantage
over
man
in
such
emergency
in
that
her
locks
being
long
and
pinned
up
are
less
easily
moved
which
may
explain
the
fact
if
it
be
a
fact
that
in
fiction
women
have
shown
themselves
more
in
ghostly
presence
than
men
or
possibly
a
woman
knows
that
a
masculine
spook
is
after
all
only
a
man
and
therefore
may
be
charmed
into
helplessness
while
the
feminine
can
be
seen
through
by
another
woman
and
thus
disarmed
the
majority
of
the
comic
apparitions
curiously
enough
are
masculine
you
do
often
find
women
wraithed
in
smiles
perhaps
because
they
resent
being
made
ridiculous
even
after
they
dead
or
maybe
the
reason
lies
in
the
fact
that
men
have
written
most
of
the
comic
or
satiric
ghost
stories
and
have
chivalrously
spared
the
gentler
shades
and
there
are
very
few
funny
you
might
almost
say
none
in
comparison
with
the
number
of
the
number
of
ghost
children
of
any
or
all
types
is
small
proportionately
perhaps
because
it
seems
an
unnatural
thing
for
a
child
to
die
under
any
circumstances
while
to
make
of
him
a
butt
for
jokes
would
be
unfeeling
there
are
a
few
instances
as
in
the
case
of
the
ghost
baby
mentioned
later
but
very
few
ancient
ghosts
were
a
lot
they
did
know
how
to
play
at
all
they
had
been
brought
up
in
stern
repression
of
frivolities
as
haunters
no
matter
how
sportive
they
may
have
been
in
life
and
in
turn
they
cowed
mortals
into
a
servile
submission
no
doubt
they
thought
of
men
and
women
as
mere
youngsters
that
must
be
taught
their
place
since
any
living
person
however
senile
would
be
thought
juvenile
compared
with
a
timeless
spook
but
in
these
days
of
individualism
and
radical
liberalism
spooks
as
well
as
mortals
are
expanding
their
personalities
and
indulging
in
greater
freedom
a
ghost
can
call
his
shade
his
own
now
and
exhibit
any
mood
he
pleases
even
young
female
wraiths
demanding
latchkeys
refuse
to
obey
the
frowning
face
of
the
clock
and
engage
in
ebullience
to
make
the
ghost
of
grundy
turn
a
shade
paler
in
horror
nowadays
haunters
have
more
fun
and
freedom
than
the
haunted
in
fact
it
money
in
one
pocket
these
days
to
be
dead
for
ghosts
have
no
rent
problems
and
dead
men
pay
no
bills
what
officer
would
willingly
pursue
a
ghostly
tenant
to
his
last
lodging
in
order
to
serve
summons
on
him
and
suppose
a
ghost
brought
into
court
demanded
trial
by
a
jury
of
his
peers
no
manifestly
death
has
compensations
not
connected
with
the
consolations
of
religion
the
marvel
is
that
apparitions
were
so
long
in
realizing
their
possibilities
in
improving
their
advantages
the
specters
in
classic
and
medieval
literature
were
malarial
vaporous
beings
without
energy
to
do
anything
but
threaten
and
mortals
never
would
have
trembled
with
fear
at
their
frown
if
they
had
known
how
feeble
they
were
at
best
a
revenant
could
only
rattle
a
rusty
skeleton
or
shake
a
moldy
shroud
or
clank
a
chain
but
as
mortals
cowered
before
his
demonstrations
he
did
worry
if
he
wished
to
evoke
the
extreme
of
anguish
from
his
host
he
raised
a
menacing
arm
and
uttered
a
windy
word
or
two
now
it
takes
more
than
that
to
produce
a
panic
the
ghost
keeps
his
skeleton
in
a
garage
or
some
place
where
it
is
cleaned
and
oiled
and
kept
in
good
working
order
the
modern
wraith
has
sold
his
sheet
to
the
old
man
and
dresses
as
in
life
now
the
ghost
has
learned
to
have
a
variety
of
good
times
and
he
can
make
the
living
squirm
far
more
satisfyingly
than
in
the
past
the
spook
of
enjoys
making
his
haunted
laugh
even
while
he
groans
in
terror
he
knows
that
no
weapon
no
threat
in
horror
to
be
compared
with
ridicule
think
what
a
solemn
creature
the
gothic
ghost
was
how
little
originality
and
initiative
he
showed
and
how
dependent
he
was
on
his
own
atmosphere
for
thrills
his
sole
appeal
was
to
the
spinal
column
the
ghost
of
touches
the
funny
bone
as
well
he
adds
new
horrors
to
being
haunted
but
new
pleasures
also
the
modern
specter
can
be
a
joyous
creature
on
occasion
as
he
can
be
when
he
wishes
fearsome
beyond
the
dreams
of
classic
or
gothic
revenant
he
has
a
keen
sense
of
humor
and
loves
a
good
joke
on
a
mortal
while
he
can
even
enjoy
one
on
himself
though
his
fun
is
of
comparatively
recent
origin
it
less
than
a
century
since
he
learned
to
crack
a
smile
the
laughing
ghost
is
very
much
alive
and
sportively
active
some
of
these
new
spooks
are
notoriously
good
company
many
americans
there
are
who
would
court
being
haunted
by
the
captain
and
crew
of
richard
middleton
ghost
ship
that
landed
in
a
turnip
field
and
dispensed
drink
till
they
demoralized
the
denizens
of
village
and
graveyard
alike
after
that
show
of
spirits
the
turnips
in
that
field
tasted
of
rum
long
after
the
ghost
ship
had
sailed
away
into
the
blue
the
modern
spook
is
possessed
not
only
of
humor
but
of
a
caustic
satire
as
well
his
jest
is
likely
to
have
more
than
one
point
to
it
and
he
can
haunt
so
insidiously
can
make
himself
so
at
home
in
his
study
or
bedroom
that
a
man
actually
welcomes
a
chat
with
him
only
to
find
out
too
late
that
his
human
foibles
have
been
mercilessly
flayed
pity
the
poor
chap
in
bunner
story
interfering
for
instance
who
was
visited
nightly
by
a
specter
that
repeated
to
him
all
the
silly
and
trite
things
he
had
said
during
the
day
a
ghost
moreover
that
towered
and
swelled
at
every
hackneyed
phrase
till
finally
he
filled
the
room
and
burst
after
the
young
man
proposed
to
his
admired
one
and
made
subsequent
remarks
ghosts
not
only
have
appallingly
long
memories
but
they
possess
a
mean
advantage
over
the
living
in
that
they
have
once
been
mortal
while
the
men
and
women
they
haunt
have
yet
been
ghosts
suppose
each
one
of
us
were
to
be
haunted
by
his
own
inane
utterances
true
we
told
that
we
have
to
give
account
some
day
for
every
idle
word
but
recording
angels
seem
more
sympathetic
than
a
sneering
ghost
at
one
elbow
ghosts
can
satirize
more
fittingly
than
anyone
else
the
absurdities
of
certain
psychic
claims
as
witness
the
delightful
seriousness
of
the
story
from
that
which
appeared
as
a
front
page
news
story
in
the
new
york
years
ago
i
should
think
that
some
of
the
futile
laggard
ghosts
that
one
reads
about
nowadays
would
blush
with
shame
before
the
wholesome
raillery
of
the
porgy
fisherman
the
modern
humorous
ghost
satirizes
everything
from
the
specter
he
very
fond
of
taking
at
him
to
the
latest
psychic
manifestations
he
laughs
at
ghosts
that
are
experts
in
efficiency
haunting
and
he
has
a
lot
of
fun
out
of
mortals
for
being
scared
of
specters
he
loves
to
shake
the
lugubrious
terrors
of
the
past
before
you
exposing
their
hollow
futility
and
he
contrives
to
create
new
fears
for
you
magically
while
you
are
laughing
at
him
the
new
ghost
hates
conventionality
and
uses
the
old
thrills
only
to
show
what
dead
batteries
they
come
from
his
really
electrical
effects
are
his
own
inventions
he
needs
no
dungeon
keeps
and
monkish
cells
to
play
about
in
not
he
he
demands
no
rag
nor
bone
nor
clank
of
chain
of
his
old
equipment
to
start
on
his
career
he
can
start
up
a
moving
picture
show
of
his
own
as
in
ruth
mcenery
stuart
haunted
and
demonstrate
a
new
kind
of
apparition
the
ghost
story
of
gives
you
spinal
sensations
with
a
difference
as
in
the
immortal
by
frank
stockton
where
the
suitor
on
the
moonlit
porch
attempting
to
tell
his
fair
one
that
he
dotes
on
her
sees
the
ghost
of
her
ferocious
uncle
who
is
dead
kicking
his
heels
against
the
railing
and
hears
his
admonition
that
he
better
hurry
up
as
the
live
uncle
is
coming
in
sight
the
thrill
with
which
you
read
of
the
ghost
in
ellis
parker
butler
late
john
who
deposits
his
wooden
leg
with
the
family
he
is
haunting
on
the
plea
that
it
is
too
materialistic
to
be
worn
with
ease
and
therefore
they
must
take
care
of
it
for
him
does
altogether
leave
you
even
when
you
discover
that
the
late
john
is
a
fraud
has
never
been
a
ghost
nor
used
a
wooden
leg
but
a
terrifying
while
you
do
believe
in
it
the
new
ghost
has
a
more
nimble
and
versatile
tongue
as
well
as
wit
in
the
older
fiction
and
drama
apparitions
spoke
seldom
and
then
merely
as
not
as
individuals
and
ghosts
like
kings
in
drama
were
of
a
dignity
and
must
preserve
it
in
their
speech
or
perhaps
the
authors
were
doubtful
as
to
the
dialogue
of
shades
and
compromised
on
a
few
stately
ejaculations
as
being
safely
phantasmal
speaking
parts
but
compare
that
usage
with
the
rude
freedom
of
some
modern
spooks
as
john
kendrick
bangs
spectral
cook
of
bangletop
who
lets
fall
her
h
and
twists
grammar
in
a
rare
and
diverting
manner
for
myself
i
hate
to
be
an
ghost
with
no
chance
to
keep
up
with
the
styles
in
slang
think
of
having
always
and
always
to
speak
a
dead
language
the
humorous
ghost
is
not
only
modern
but
he
is
distinctively
american
there
are
ghosts
of
all
nationalities
naturally
but
the
spook
that
provides
a
joke
on
his
host
or
on
himself
is
yankee
in
origin
and
development
the
dry
humor
the
comic
sense
of
the
incongruous
the
willingness
to
laugh
at
himself
as
at
others
carry
over
into
immaterialization
as
characteristic
american
qualities
and
are
preserved
in
their
true
flavor
i
do
assert
of
course
that
americans
have
been
the
only
ones
in
this
field
the
french
and
english
selections
in
this
volume
are
sufficient
to
prove
the
contrary
gautier
has
a
humor
of
a
lightness
and
grace
as
delicate
as
the
little
foot
itself
there
are
various
english
stories
of
whimsical
haunting
some
of
actual
spooks
and
some
of
the
hoax
type
hoax
ghosts
are
fairly
numerous
in
british
as
in
american
literature
one
of
the
early
specimens
of
the
kind
being
specter
of
in
the
the
files
of
reveal
several
examples
though
not
of
high
literary
value
of
the
early
specimens
of
the
really
amusing
ghost
that
is
an
actual
revenant
is
ghost
in
which
shows
originality
and
humor
yet
is
too
diffuse
for
printing
here
in
that
we
have
a
conventional
young
bachelor
engaged
to
a
charming
girl
who
is
entangled
in
social
complications
and
made
to
suffer
mental
torment
because
without
his
consent
he
has
been
chosen
as
the
nurse
and
guardian
of
a
ghost
baby
that
cradles
after
him
wherever
he
goes
this
is
a
rich
story
almost
spoiled
by
being
poorly
told
i
sigh
to
think
of
the
laughs
that
frank
stockton
or
john
kendrick
bangs
or
gelett
burgess
could
have
got
out
of
the
situation
there
are
other
comic
british
spooks
as
in
happy
where
a
widow
and
a
widower
in
love
are
haunted
by
the
jealous
ghosts
of
their
respective
spouses
till
the
phantom
couple
take
a
liking
to
each
other
and
decide
to
let
the
living
bury
their
dead
this
is
suggestive
of
brander
matthews
earlier
and
cleverer
story
of
a
spectral
courtship
in
rival
medieval
and
later
literature
gave
us
many
instances
of
a
love
affair
or
marriage
between
one
spirit
and
one
mortal
but
it
remained
for
the
modern
american
to
celebrate
the
nuptials
of
two
ghosts
think
of
being
married
when
you
know
that
you
and
the
other
party
are
going
to
live
ever
after
whether
happily
or
no
truly
the
present
terrors
are
more
fearsome
than
the
old
the
stories
by
eden
phillpotts
and
richard
middleton
in
this
collection
show
the
diversity
of
the
english
humor
as
associated
with
apparitions
and
are
entertaining
in
themselves
the
by
oscar
wilde
is
one
of
his
best
short
stories
and
is
in
his
happiest
vein
of
laughing
satire
this
travesty
on
the
conventional
traditions
of
the
wraith
is
preposterously
delightful
one
of
the
cleverest
ghost
stories
in
our
language
zangwill
has
written
engagingly
of
spooks
with
a
laughable
story
about
samuel
johnson
and
there
are
others
but
the
fact
remains
that
in
spite
of
conceded
and
admirable
examples
the
humorous
ghost
story
is
for
the
most
part
american
in
creation
and
spirit
washington
irving
might
be
said
to
have
started
that
fashion
in
skeletons
and
shades
for
he
has
given
us
various
comic
haunters
some
real
and
some
frank
stockton
gave
his
to
funny
spooks
with
a
riotous
and
laughing
pen
the
spirit
in
his
is
impudently
deathless
and
has
called
up
a
train
of
subsequent
haunters
john
kendrick
bangs
has
made
the
darker
regions
seem
comfortable
and
homelike
for
us
and
has
created
ghosts
so
human
and
so
funny
that
we
look
forward
to
being
one
or
more
we
feel
downright
neighborly
toward
such
specters
as
the
futile
last
ghost
nelson
lloyd
evokes
for
us
as
we
appreciate
the
satire
of
rose
sophisticated
wraith
the
daring
concept
of
gelett
burgess
ghost
extinguisher
is
altogether
american
the
field
is
still
comparatively
limited
but
a
number
of
americans
have
done
distinctive
work
in
it
the
specter
now
wears
motley
instead
of
a
shroud
and
shakes
his
bells
the
while
he
rattles
his
bones
i
dare
any

grouchy
reader
to
finish

having
a
kindlier
feeling

was
haunted
indeed
lord
canterville
himself
who
was
a
man
of
the
most
punctilious
honor
had
felt
it
his
duty
to
mention
the
fact
to
otis
when
they
came
to
discuss
terms
we
have
not
cared
to
live
in
the
place
ourselves
said
lord
canterville
since
my
the
dowager
duchess
of
bolton
was
frightened
into
a
fit
from
which
she
never
really
recovered
by
two
skeleton
hands
being
placed
on
her
shoulders
as
she
was
dressing
for
dinner
and
i
feel
bound
to
tell
you
otis
that
the
ghost
has
been
seen
by
several
living
members
of
my
family
as
well
as
by
the
rector
of
the
parish
the
rev
augustus
dampier
who
is
a
fellow
of
college
cambridge
after
the
unfortunate
accident
to
the
duchess
none
of
our
younger
servants
would
stay
with
us
and
lady
canterville
often
got
very
little
sleep
at
night
in
consequence
of
the
mysterious
noises
that
came
from
the
corridor
and
the
library
my
lord
answered
the
minister
i
will
take
the
furniture
and
the
ghost
at
a
valuation
i
have
come
from
a
modern
country
where
we
have
everything
that
money
can
buy
and
with
all
our
spry
young
fellows
painting
the
old
world
red
and
carrying
off
your
best
actors
and
i
reckon
that
if
there
were
such
a
thing
as
a
ghost
in
europe
we
have
it
at
home
in
a
very
short
time
in
one
of
our
public
museums
or
on
the
road
as
a
show
i
fear
that
the
ghost
exists
said
lord
canterville
smiling
though
it
may
have
resisted
the
overtures
of
your
enterprising
impresarios
it
has
been
well
known
for
three
centuries
since
in
fact
and
always
makes
its
appearance
before
the
death
of
any
member
of
our
family
well
so
does
the
family
doctor
for
that
matter
lord
canterville
but
there
is
no
such
thing
sir
as
a
ghost
and
i
guess
the
laws
of
nature
are
not
going
to
be
suspended
for
the
british
aristocracy
you
are
certainly
very
natural
in
america
answered
lord
canterville
who
did
not
quite
understand
otis
last
observation
and
if
you
do
mind
a
ghost
in
the
house
it
is
all
right
only
you
must
remember
i
warned
you
a
few
weeks
after
this
the
purchase
was
concluded
and
at
the
close
of
the
season
the
minister
and
his
family
went
down
to
canterville
chase
otis
who
as
miss
lucretia
tappan
of
west
street
had
been
a
celebrated
new
york
belle
was
now
a
very
handsome
woman
with
fine
eyes
and
a
superb
profile
many
american
ladies
on
leaving
their
native
land
adopt
an
appearance
of
chronic
under
the
impression
that
it
is
a
form
of
european
refinement
but
otis
had
never
fallen
into
this
error
she
had
a
magnificent
constitution
and
a
really
wonderful
amount
of
animal
spirits
indeed
in
many
respects
she
was
quite
english
and
was
an
excellent
example
of
the
fact
that
we
have
really
everything
in
common
with
america
nowadays
except
of
course
language
her
eldest
son
christened
washington
by
his
parents
in
a
moment
of
patriotism
which
he
never
ceased
to
regret
was
a
rather
young
man
who
had
qualified
himself
for
american
diplomacy
by
leading
the
german
at
the
newport
casino
for
three
successive
seasons
and
even
in
london
was
well
known
as
an
excellent
dancer
gardenias
and
the
peerage
were
his
only
weaknesses
otherwise
he
was
extremely
sensible
miss
virginia
otis
was
a
little
girl
of
fifteen
lithe
and
lovely
as
a
fawn
and
with
a
fine
freedom
in
her
large
blue
eyes
she
was
a
wonderful
amazon
and
had
once
raced
old
lord
bilton
on
her
pony
twice
round
the
park
winning
by
a
length
and
a
half
just
in
front
of
the
achilles
statue
to
the
huge
delight
of
the
young
duke
of
cheshire
who
proposed
for
her
on
the
spot
and
was
sent
back
to
eton
that
very
night
by
his
guardians
in
floods
of
tears
after
virginia
came
the
twins
who
were
usually
called
the
stars
and
stripes
as
they
were
always
getting
swished
they
were
delightful
boys
and
with
the
exception
of
the
worthy
minister
the
only
true
republicans
of
the
family
as
canterville
chase
is
seven
miles
from
ascot
the
nearest
railway
station
otis
had
telegraphed
for
a
wagonette
to
meet
them
and
they
started
on
their
drive
in
high
spirits
it
was
a
lovely
july
evening
and
the
air
was
delicate
with
the
scent
of
the
pinewoods
now
and
then
they
heard
a
brooding
over
its
own
sweet
voice
or
saw
deep
in
the
rustling
fern
the
burnished
breast
of
the
pheasant
little
squirrels
peered
at
them
from
the
as
they
went
by
and
the
rabbits
scudded
away
through
the
brushwood
and
over
the
mossy
knolls
with
their
white
tails
in
the
air
as
they
entered
the
avenue
of
canterville
chase
however
the
sky
became
suddenly
overcast
with
clouds
a
curious
stillness
seemed
to
hold
the
atmosphere
a
great
flight
of
rooks
passed
silently
over
their
heads
and
before
they
reached
the
house
some
big
drops
of
rain
had
fallen
standing
on
the
steps
to
receive
them
was
an
old
woman
neatly
dressed
in
black
silk
with
a
white
cap
and
apron
this
was
umney
the
housekeeper
whom
otis
at
lady
canterville
earnest
request
had
consented
to
keep
in
her
former
position
she
made
them
each
a
low
curtsy
as
they
alighted
and
said
in
a
quaint
manner
i
bid
you
welcome
to
canterville
chase
following
her
they
passed
through
the
fine
tudor
hall
into
the
library
a
long
low
room
paneled
in
black
oak
at
the
end
of
which
was
a
large
stained
glass
window
here
they
found
tea
laid
out
for
them
and
after
taking
off
their
wraps
they
sat
down
and
began
to
look
round
while
umney
waited
on
them
suddenly
otis
caught
sight
of
a
dull
red
stain
on
the
floor
just
by
the
fireplace
and
quite
unconscious
of
what
it
really
signified
said
to
umney
i
am
afraid
something
has
been
spilled
there
yes
madam
replied
the
old
housekeeper
in
a
low
voice
blood
has
been
spilled
on
that
spot
how
horrid
cried
otis
i
do
at
all
care
for
in
a
it
must
be
removed
at
once
the
old
woman
smiled
and
answered
in
the
same
low
mysterious
voice
it
is
the
blood
of
lady
eleanore
de
canterville
who
was
murdered
on
that
very
spot
by
her
own
husband
sir
simon
de
canterville
in
sir
simon
survived
her
nine
years
and
disappeared
suddenly
under
very
mysterious
circumstances
his
body
has
never
been
discovered
but
his
guilty
spirit
still
haunts
the
chase
the
has
been
much
admired
by
tourists
and
others
and
can
not
be
removed
that
is
all
nonsense
cried
washington
otis
pinkerton
champion
stain
remover
and
paragon
detergent
will
clean
it
up
in
no
time
and
before
the
terrified
housekeeper
could
interfere
he
had
fallen
upon
his
knees
and
was
rapidly
scouring
the
floor
with
a
small
stick
of
what
looked
like
a
black
cosmetic
in
a
few
moments
no
trace
of
the
could
be
seen
i
knew
pinkerton
would
do
it
he
exclaimed
triumphantly
as
he
looked
round
at
his
admiring
family
but
no
sooner
had
he
said
these
words
than
a
terrible
flash
of
lightning
lit
up
the
somber
room
a
fearful
peal
of
thunder
made
them
all
start
to
their
feet
and
umney
fainted
what
a
monstrous
climate
said
the
american
minister
calmly
as
he
lit
a
long
cheroot
i
guess
the
old
country
is
so
overpopulated
that
they
have
not
enough
decent
weather
for
everybody
i
have
always
been
of
opinion
that
emigration
is
the
only
thing
for
england
my
dear
hiram
cried
otis
what
can
we
do
with
a
woman
who
faints
charge
it
to
her
like
breakages
answered
the
minister
she
faint
after
that
and
in
a
few
moments
umney
certainly
came
to
there
was
no
doubt
however
that
she
was
extremely
upset
and
she
sternly
warned
otis
to
beware
of
some
trouble
coming
to
the
house
i
have
seen
things
with
my
own
eyes
sir
she
said
that
would
make
any
christian
hair
stand
on
end
and
many
and
many
a
night
i
have
not
closed
my
eyes
in
sleep
for
the
awful
things
that
are
done
here
otis
however
and
his
wife
warmly
assured
the
honest
soul
that
they
were
not
afraid
of
ghosts
and
after
invoking
the
blessings
of
providence
on
her
new
master
and
mistress
and
making
arrangements
for
an
increase
of
salary
the
old
housekeeper
tottered
off
to
her
own
room
ii
the
storm
raged
fiercely
all
that
night
but
nothing
of
particular
note
occurred
the
next
morning
however
when
they
came
down
to
breakfast
they
found
the
terrible
stain
of
blood
once
again
on
the
floor
i
think
it
can
be
the
fault
of
the
paragon
detergent
said
washington
for
i
have
tried
it
with
everything
it
must
be
the
ghost
he
accordingly
rubbed
out
the
stain
a
second
time
but
the
second
morning
it
appeared
again
the
third
morning
also
it
was
there
though
the
library
had
been
locked
up
at
night
by
otis
himself
and
the
key
carried
upstairs
the
whole
family
were
now
quite
interested
otis
began
to
suspect
that
he
had
been
too
dogmatic
in
his
denial
of
the
existence
of
ghosts
otis
expressed
her
intention
of
joining
the
psychical
society
and
washington
prepared
a
long
letter
to
myers
and
podmore
on
the
subject
of
the
permanence
of
sanguineous
stains
when
connected
with
crime
that
night
all
doubts
about
the
objective
existence
of
phantasmata
were
removed
forever
the
day
had
been
warm
and
sunny
and
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
the
whole
family
went
out
to
drive
they
did
not
return
home
till
nine
when
they
had
a
light
supper
the
conversation
in
no
way
turned
upon
ghosts
so
there
were
not
even
those
primary
conditions
of
receptive
expectations
which
so
often
precede
the
presentation
of
psychical
phenomena
the
subjects
discussed
as
i
have
since
learned
from
otis
were
merely
such
as
form
the
ordinary
conversation
of
cultured
americans
of
the
better
class
such
as
the
immense
superiority
of
miss
fanny
devonport
over
sarah
bernhardt
as
an
actress
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
green
corn
buckwheat
cakes
and
hominy
even
in
the
best
english
houses
the
importance
of
boston
in
the
development
of
the
the
advantages
of
the
system
in
railway
traveling
and
the
sweetness
of
the
new
york
accent
as
compared
to
the
london
drawl
no
mention
at
all
was
made
of
the
supernatural
nor
was
sir
simon
de
canterville
alluded
to
in
any
way
at
eleven
the
family
retired
and
by
all
the
lights
were
out
some
time
after
otis
was
awakened
by
a
curious
noise
in
the
corridor
outside
his
room
it
sounded
like
the
clank
of
metal
and
seemed
to
be
coming
nearer
every
moment
he
got
up
at
once
struck
a
match
and
looked
at
the
time
it
was
exactly
one
he
was
quite
calm
and
felt
his
pulse
which
was
not
at
all
feverish
the
strange
noise
still
continued
and
with
it
he
heard
distinctly
the
sound
of
footsteps
he
put
on
his
slippers
took
a
small
oblong
phial
out
of
his
and
opened
the
door
right
in
front
of
him
he
saw
in
the
wan
moonlight
an
old
man
of
terrible
aspect
his
eyes
were
as
red
burning
coals
long
gray
hair
fell
over
his
shoulders
in
matted
coils
his
garments
which
were
of
antique
cut
were
soiled
and
ragged
and
from
his
wrists
and
ankles
hung
heavy
manacles
and
rusty
gyves
my
dear
sir
said
otis
i
really
must
insist
on
your
oiling
those
chains
and
have
brought
you
for
that
purpose
a
small
bottle
of
the
tammany
rising
sun
lubricator
it
is
said
to
be
completely
efficacious
upon
one
application
and
there
are
several
testimonials
to
that
effect
on
the
wrapper
from
some
of
our
most
eminent
native
divines
i
shall
leave
it
here
for
you
by
the
bedroom
candles
and
will
be
happy
to
supply
you
with
more
should
you
require
it
with
these
words
the
united
states
minister
laid
the
bottle
down
on
a
marble
table
and
closing
his
door
retired
to
rest
for
a
moment
the
canterville
ghost
stood
quite
motionless
in
natural
indignation
then
dashing
the
bottle
violently
upon
the
polished
floor
he
fled
down
the
corridor
uttering
hollow
groans
and
emitting
a
ghastly
green
light
just
however
as
he
reached
the
top
of
the
great
oak
staircase
a
door
was
flung
open
two
little
figures
appeared
and
a
large
pillow
whizzed
past
his
head
there
was
evidently
no
time
to
be
lost
so
hastily
adopting
the
fourth
dimension
of
space
as
a
means
of
escape
he
vanished
through
the
wainscoting
and
the
house
became
quite
quiet
on
reaching
a
small
secret
chamber
in
the
left
wing
he
leaned
up
against
a
moonbeam
to
recover
his
breath
and
began
to
try
and
realize
his
position
never
in
a
brilliant
and
uninterrupted
career
of
three
hundred
years
had
he
been
so
grossly
insulted
he
thought
of
the
dowager
duchess
whom
he
had
frightened
into
a
fit
as
she
stood
before
the
glass
in
her
lace
and
diamonds
of
the
four
housemaids
who
had
gone
into
hysterics
when
he
merely
grinned
at
them
through
the
curtains
on
one
of
the
spare
bedrooms
of
the
rector
of
the
parish
whose
candle
he
had
blown
out
as
he
was
coming
late
one
night
from
the
library
and
who
had
been
under
the
care
of
sir
william
gull
ever
since
a
perfect
martyr
to
nervous
disorders
and
of
old
madame
de
tremouillac
who
having
wakened
up
one
morning
early
and
seen
a
skeleton
seated
in
an
by
the
fire
reading
her
diary
had
been
confined
to
her
bed
for
six
weeks
with
an
attack
of
brain
fever
and
on
her
recovery
had
become
reconciled
to
the
church
and
broken
off
her
connection
with
that
notorious
skeptic
monsieur
de
voltaire
he
remembered
the
terrible
night
when
the
wicked
lord
canterville
was
found
choking
in
his
with
the
knave
of
diamonds
halfway
down
his
throat
and
confessed
just
before
he
died
that
he
had
cheated
charles
james
fox
out
of
at
crockford
by
means
of
that
very
card
and
swore
that
the
ghost
had
made
him
swallow
it
all
his
great
achievements
came
back
to
him
again
from
the
butler
who
had
shot
himself
in
the
pantry
because
he
had
seen
a
green
hand
tapping
at
the
windowpane
to
the
beautiful
lady
stutfield
who
was
always
obliged
to
wear
a
black
velvet
band
round
her
throat
to
hide
the
mark
of
five
fingers
burnt
upon
her
white
skin
and
who
drowned
herself
at
last
in
the
at
the
end
of
the
king
walk
with
the
enthusiastic
egotism
of
the
true
artist
he
went
over
his
most
celebrated
performances
and
smiled
bitterly
to
himself
as
he
recalled
to
mind
his
last
appearance
as
red
reuben
or
the
strangled
babe
his
as
gaunt
gibeon
the
of
bexley
moor
and
the
he
had
excited
one
lovely
june
evening
by
merely
playing
ninepins
with
his
own
bones
upon
the
ground
and
after
all
this
some
wretched
modern
americans
were
to
come
and
offer
him
the
rising
sun
lubricator
and
throw
pillows
at
his
head
it
was
quite
unbearable
besides
no
ghost
in
history
had
ever
been
treated
in
this
manner
accordingly
he
determined
to
have
vengeance
and
remained
till
daylight
in
an
attitude
of
deep
thought
iii
the
next
morning
when
the
otis
family
met
at
breakfast
they
discussed
the
ghost
at
some
length
the
united
states
minister
was
naturally
a
little
annoyed
to
find
that
his
present
had
not
been
accepted
i
have
no
wish
he
said
to
do
the
ghost
any
personal
injury
and
i
must
say
that
considering
the
length
of
time
he
has
been
in
the
house
i
think
it
is
at
all
polite
to
throw
pillows
at
him
a
very
just
remark
at
which
i
am
sorry
to
say
the
twins
burst
into
shouts
of
laughter
upon
the
other
hand
he
continued
if
he
really
declines
to
use
the
rising
sun
lubricator
we
shall
have
to
take
his
chains
from
him
it
would
be
quite
impossible
to
sleep
with
such
a
noise
going
on
outside
the
bedrooms
for
the
rest
of
the
week
however
they
were
undisturbed
the
only
thing
that
excited
any
attention
being
the
continual
renewal
of
the
on
the
library
floor
this
certainly
was
very
strange
as
the
door
was
always
locked
at
night
by
otis
and
the
windows
kept
closely
barred
the
color
also
of
the
stain
excited
a
good
deal
of
comment
some
mornings
it
was
a
dull
almost
indian
red
then
it
would
be
vermilion
then
a
rich
purple
and
once
when
they
came
down
for
family
prayers
according
to
the
simple
rites
of
the
free
american
reformed
episcopalian
church
they
found
it
a
bright
these
kaleidoscopic
changes
naturally
amused
the
party
very
much
and
bets
on
the
subject
were
freely
made
every
evening
the
only
person
who
did
not
enter
into
the
joke
was
little
virginia
who
for
some
unexplained
reason
was
always
a
good
deal
distressed
at
the
sight
of
the
and
very
nearly
cried
the
morning
it
was
the
second
appearance
of
the
ghost
was
on
sunday
night
shortly
after
they
had
gone
to
bed
they
were
suddenly
alarmed
by
a
fearful
crash
in
the
hall
rushing
downstairs
they
found
that
a
large
suit
of
old
armor
had
become
detached
from
its
stand
and
had
fallen
on
the
stone
floor
while
seated
in
a
chair
was
the
canterville
ghost
rubbing
his
knees
with
an
expression
of
acute
agony
on
his
face
the
twins
having
brought
their
with
them
at
once
discharged
two
pellets
on
him
with
that
accuracy
of
aim
which
can
only
be
attained
by
long
and
careful
practice
on
a
while
the
united
states
minister
covered
him
with
his
revolver
and
called
upon
him
in
accordance
with
californian
etiquette
to
hold
up
his
hands
the
ghost
started
up
with
a
wild
shriek
of
rage
and
swept
through
them
like
a
mist
extinguishing
washington
otis
candle
as
he
passed
and
so
leaving
them
all
in
total
darkness
on
reaching
the
top
of
the
staircase
he
recovered
himself
and
determined
to
give
his
celebrated
peal
of
demoniac
laughter
this
he
had
on
more
than
one
occasion
found
extremely
useful
it
was
said
to
have
turned
lord
raker
wig
gray
in
a
single
night
and
had
certainly
made
three
of
lady
canterville
french
governesses
give
warning
before
their
month
was
up
he
accordingly
laughed
his
most
horrible
laugh
till
the
old
vaulted
roof
rang
and
rang
again
but
hardly
had
the
fearful
echo
died
away
when
a
door
opened
and
otis
came
out
in
a
light
blue
i
am
afraid
you
are
far
from
well
she
said
and
have
brought
you
a
bottle
of
doctor
dobell
tincture
if
it
is
indigestion
you
will
find
it
a
most
excellent
remedy
the
ghost
glared
at
her
in
fury
and
began
at
once
to
make
preparations
for
turning
himself
into
a
large
black
dog
an
accomplishment
for
which
he
was
justly
renowned
and
to
which
the
family
doctor
always
attributed
the
permanent
idiocy
of
lord
uncle
the
hon
thomas
horton
the
sound
of
approaching
footsteps
however
made
him
hesitate
in
his
fell
purpose
so
he
contented
himself
with
becoming
faintly
phosphorescent
and
vanished
with
a
deep
churchyard
groan
just
as
the
twins
had
come
up
to
him
on
reaching
his
room
he
entirely
broke
down
and
became
a
prey
to
the
most
violent
agitation
the
vulgarity
of
the
twins
and
the
gross
materialism
of
otis
were
naturally
extremely
annoying
but
what
really
distressed
him
most
was
that
he
had
been
unable
to
wear
the
suit
of
mail
he
had
hoped
that
even
modern
americans
would
be
thrilled
by
the
sight
of
a
specter
in
armor
if
for
no
more
sensible
reason
at
least
out
of
respect
for
their
national
poet
longfellow
over
whose
graceful
and
attractive
poetry
he
himself
had
whiled
away
many
a
weary
hour
when
the
cantervilles
were
up
in
town
besides
it
was
his
own
suit
he
had
worn
it
with
great
success
at
the
kenilworth
tournament
and
had
been
highly
complimented
on
it
by
no
less
a
person
than
the
virgin
queen
herself
yet
when
he
had
put
it
on
he
had
been
completely
overpowered
by
the
weight
of
the
huge
breastplate
and
steel
casque
and
had
fallen
heavily
on
the
stone
pavement
barking
both
his
knees
severely
and
bruising
the
knuckles
of
his
right
hand
for
some
days
after
this
he
was
extremely
ill
and
hardly
stirred
out
of
his
room
at
all
except
to
keep
the
in
proper
repair
however
by
taking
great
care
of
himself
he
recovered
and
resolved
to
make
a
third
attempt
to
frighten
the
united
states
minister
and
his
family
he
selected
friday
august
for
his
appearance
and
spent
most
of
that
day
in
looking
over
his
wardrobe
ultimately
deciding
in
favor
of
a
large
slouched
hat
with
a
red
feather
a
frilled
at
the
wrists
and
neck
and
a
rusty
dagger
towards
evening
a
violent
storm
of
rain
came
on
and
the
wind
was
so
high
that
all
the
windows
and
doors
in
the
old
house
shook
and
rattled
in
fact
it
was
just
such
weather
as
he
loved
his
plan
of
action
was
this
he
was
to
make
his
way
quietly
to
washington
otis
room
gibber
at
him
from
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
stab
himself
three
times
in
the
throat
to
the
sound
of
low
music
he
bore
washington
a
special
grudge
being
quite
aware
that
it
was
he
who
was
in
the
habit
of
removing
the
famous
canterville
by
means
of
pinkerton
paragon
detergent
having
reduced
the
reckless
and
foolhardy
youth
to
a
condition
of
abject
terror
he
was
then
to
proceed
to
the
room
occupied
by
the
united
states
minister
and
his
wife
and
there
to
place
a
clammy
hand
on
otis
forehead
while
he
hissed
into
her
trembling
husband
ear
the
awful
secrets
of
the
with
regard
to
little
virginia
he
had
not
quite
made
up
his
mind
she
had
never
insulted
him
in
any
way
and
was
pretty
and
gentle
a
few
hollow
groans
from
the
wardrobe
he
thought
would
be
more
than
sufficient
or
if
that
failed
to
wake
her
he
might
grabble
at
the
counterpane
with
fingers
as
for
the
twins
he
was
quite
determined
to
teach
them
a
lesson
the
first
thing
to
be
done
was
of
course
to
sit
upon
their
chests
so
as
to
produce
the
stifling
sensation
of
nightmare
then
as
their
beds
were
quite
close
to
each
other
to
stand
between
them
in
the
form
of
a
green
corpse
till
they
became
paralyzed
with
fear
and
finally
to
throw
off
the
and
crawl
round
the
room
with
white
bleached
bones
and
one
rolling
eyeball
in
the
character
of
dumb
daniel
or
the
skeleton
a
in
which
he
had
on
more
than
one
occasion
produced
a
great
effect
and
which
he
considered
quite
equal
to
his
famous
part
of
martin
the
maniac
or
the
masked
mystery
at
ten
he
heard
the
family
going
to
bed
for
some
time
he
was
disturbed
by
wild
shrieks
of
laughter
from
the
twins
who
with
the
gayety
of
schoolboys
were
evidently
amusing
themselves
before
they
retired
to
rest
but
at
a
eleven
all
was
still
and
as
midnight
sounded
he
sallied
forth
the
owl
beat
against
the
the
raven
croaked
from
the
old
and
the
wind
wandered
moaning
round
the
house
like
a
lost
soul
but
the
otis
family
slept
unconscious
of
their
doom
and
high
above
the
rain
and
storm
he
could
hear
the
steady
snoring
of
the
minister
for
the
united
states
he
stepped
stealthily
out
of
the
wainscoting
with
an
evil
smile
on
his
cruel
wrinkled
mouth
and
the
moon
hid
her
face
in
a
cloud
as
he
stole
past
the
great
oriel
window
where
his
own
arms
and
those
of
his
murdered
wife
were
blazoned
in
azure
and
gold
on
and
on
he
glided
like
an
evil
shadow
the
very
darkness
seeming
to
loathe
him
as
he
passed
once
he
thought
he
heard
something
call
and
stopped
but
it
was
only
the
baying
of
a
dog
from
the
red
farm
and
he
went
on
muttering
strange
sixteenth
century
curses
and
ever
and
anon
brandishing
the
rusty
dagger
in
the
midnight
air
finally
he
reached
the
corner
of
the
passage
that
led
to
luckless
washington
room
for
a
moment
he
paused
there
the
wind
blowing
his
long
gray
locks
about
his
head
and
twisting
into
grotesque
and
fantastic
folds
the
nameless
horror
of
the
dead
shroud
then
the
clock
struck
the
quarter
and
he
felt
the
time
was
come
he
chuckled
to
himself
and
turned
the
corner
but
no
sooner
had
he
done
so
than
with
a
piteous
wail
of
terror
he
fell
back
and
hid
his
blanched
face
in
his
long
bony
hands
right
in
front
of
him
was
standing
a
horrible
specter
motionless
as
a
carven
image
and
monstrous
as
a
madman
dream
its
head
was
bald
and
burnished
its
face
round
and
fat
and
white
and
hideous
laughter
seemed
to
have
writhed
its
features
into
an
eternal
grin
from
the
eyes
streamed
rays
of
scarlet
light
the
mouth
was
a
wide
well
of
fire
and
a
hideous
garment
like
to
his
own
swathed
with
its
silent
snows
the
titan
form
on
its
breast
was
a
placard
with
strange
writing
in
antique
characters
some
scroll
of
shame
it
seemed
some
record
of
wild
sins
some
awful
calendar
of
crime
and
with
its
right
hand
it
bore
aloft
a
falchion
of
gleaming
steel
never
having
seen
a
ghost
before
he
naturally
was
terribly
frightened
and
after
a
second
hasty
glance
at
the
awful
phantom
he
fled
back
to
his
room
tripping
up
in
his
long
as
he
sped
down
the
corridor
and
finally
dropping
the
rusty
dagger
into
the
where
it
was
found
in
the
morning
by
the
butler
once
in
the
privacy
of
his
own
apartment
he
flung
himself
down
on
a
small
and
hid
his
face
under
the
clothes
after
a
time
however
the
brave
old
canterville
spirit
asserted
itself
and
he
determined
to
go
and
speak
to
the
other
ghost
as
soon
as
it
was
daylight
accordingly
just
as
the
dawn
was
touching
the
hills
with
silver
he
returned
towards
the
spot
where
he
had
first
laid
eyes
on
the
grisly
phantom
feeling
that
after
all
two
ghosts
were
better
than
one
and
that
by
the
aid
of
his
new
friend
he
might
safely
grapple
with
the
twins
on
reaching
the
spot
however
a
terrible
sight
met
his
gaze
something
had
evidently
happened
to
the
specter
for
the
light
had
entirely
faded
from
its
hollow
eyes
the
gleaming
falchion
had
fallen
from
its
hand
and
it
was
leaning
up
against
the
wall
in
a
strained
and
uncomfortable
attitude
he
rushed
forward
and
seized
it
in
his
arms
when
to
his
horror
the
head
slipped
off
and
rolled
on
the
floor
the
body
assumed
a
recumbent
posture
and
he
found
himself
clasping
a
white
dimity
with
a
a
kitchen
cleaver
and
a
hollow
turnip
lying
at
his
feet
unable
to
understand
this
curious
transformation
he
clutched
the
placard
with
feverish
haste
and
there
in
the
gray
morning
light
he
read
these
fearful
words
ye
otis
ghoste
ye
onlie
true
and
originale
spook
beware
of
ye
imitationes
all
others
are
counterfeite
the
whole
thing
flashed
across
him
he
had
been
tricked
foiled
and
outwitted
the
old
canterville
look
came
into
his
eyes
he
ground
his
toothless
gums
together
and
raising
his
withered
hands
high
above
his
head
swore
according
to
the
picturesque
phraseology
of
the
antique
school
that
when
chanticleer
had
sounded
twice
his
merry
horn
deeds
of
blood
would
be
wrought
and
murder
walk
abroad
with
silent
feet
hardly
had
he
finished
this
awful
oath
when
from
the
roof
of
a
distant
homestead
a
cock
crew
he
laughed
a
long
low
bitter
laugh
and
waited
hour
after
hour
he
waited
but
the
cock
for
some
strange
reason
did
not
crow
again
finally
at
seven
the
arrival
of
the
housemaids
made
him
give
up
his
fearful
vigil
and
he
stalked
back
to
his
room
thinking
of
his
vain
oath
and
baffled
purpose
there
he
consulted
several
books
of
ancient
chivalry
of
which
he
was
exceedingly
fond
and
found
that
on
every
occasion
on
which
this
oath
had
been
used
chanticleer
had
always
crowed
a
second
time
perdition
seize
the
naughty
fowl
he
muttered
i
have
seen
the
day
when
with
my
stout
spear
i
would
have
run
him
through
the
gorge
and
made
him
crow
for
me
an
in
death
he
then
retired
to
a
comfortable
lead
coffin
and
stayed
there
till
evening
iv
the
next
day
the
ghost
was
very
weak
and
tired
the
terrible
excitement
of
the
last
four
weeks
was
beginning
to
have
its
effect
his
nerves
were
completely
shattered
and
he
started
at
the
slightest
noise
for
five
days
he
kept
his
room
and
at
last
made
up
his
mind
to
give
up
the
point
of
the
on
the
library
floor
if
the
otis
family
did
not
want
it
they
clearly
did
not
deserve
it
they
were
evidently
people
on
a
low
material
plane
of
existence
and
quite
incapable
of
appreciating
the
symbolic
value
of
sensuous
phenomena
the
question
of
phantasmic
apparitions
and
the
development
of
astral
bodies
was
of
course
quite
a
different
matter
and
really
not
under
his
control
it
was
his
solemn
duty
to
appear
in
the
corridor
once
a
week
and
to
gibber
from
the
large
oriel
window
on
the
first
and
third
wednesdays
in
every
month
and
he
did
not
see
how
he
could
honorably
escape
from
his
obligations
it
is
quite
true
that
his
life
had
been
very
evil
but
upon
the
other
hand
he
was
most
conscientious
in
all
things
connected
with
the
supernatural
for
the
next
three
saturdays
accordingly
he
traversed
the
corridor
as
usual
between
midnight
and
three
taking
every
possible
precaution
against
being
either
heard
or
seen
he
removed
his
boots
trod
as
lightly
as
possible
on
the
old
boards
wore
a
large
black
velvet
cloak
and
was
careful
to
use
the
rising
sun
lubricator
for
oiling
his
chains
i
am
bound
to
acknowledge
that
it
was
with
a
good
deal
of
difficulty
that
he
brought
himself
to
adopt
this
last
mode
of
protection
however
one
night
while
the
family
were
at
dinner
he
slipped
into
otis
bedroom
and
carried
off
the
bottle
he
felt
a
little
humiliated
at
first
but
afterwards
was
sensible
enough
to
see
that
there
was
a
great
deal
to
be
said
for
the
invention
and
to
a
certain
degree
it
served
his
purpose
still
in
spite
of
everything
he
was
not
left
unmolested
strings
were
continually
being
stretched
across
the
corridor
over
which
he
tripped
in
the
dark
and
on
one
occasion
while
dressed
for
the
part
of
black
isaac
or
the
huntsman
of
hogley
woods
he
met
with
a
severe
fall
through
treading
on
a
which
the
twins
had
constructed
from
the
entrance
of
the
tapestry
chamber
to
the
top
of
the
oak
staircase
this
last
insult
so
enraged
him
that
he
resolved
to
make
one
final
effort
to
assert
his
dignity
and
social
position
and
determined
to
visit
the
insolent
young
etonians
the
next
night
in
his
celebrated
character
of
reckless
rupert
or
the
headless
earl
he
had
not
appeared
in
this
disguise
for
more
than
seventy
years
in
fact
not
since
he
had
so
frightened
pretty
lady
barbara
modish
by
means
of
it
that
she
suddenly
broke
off
her
engagement
with
the
present
lord
canterville
grandfather
and
ran
away
to
gretna
green
with
handsome
jack
castletown
declaring
that
nothing
in
the
world
would
induce
her
to
marry
into
a
family
that
allowed
such
a
horrible
phantom
to
walk
up
and
down
the
terrace
at
twilight
poor
jack
was
afterwards
shot
in
a
duel
by
lord
canterville
on
wandsworth
common
and
lady
barbara
died
of
a
broken
heart
at
tunbridge
wells
before
the
year
was
out
so
in
every
way
it
had
been
a
great
success
it
was
however
an
extremely
difficult
if
i
may
use
such
a
theatrical
expression
in
connection
with
one
of
the
greatest
mysteries
of
the
supernatural
or
to
employ
a
more
scientific
term
the
world
and
it
took
him
fully
three
hours
to
make
his
preparations
at
last
everything
was
ready
and
he
was
very
pleased
with
his
appearance
the
big
leather
that
went
with
the
dress
were
just
a
little
too
large
for
him
and
he
could
only
find
one
of
the
two
but
on
the
whole
he
was
quite
satisfied
and
at
a
one
he
glided
out
of
the
wainscoting
and
crept
down
the
corridor
on
reaching
the
room
occupied
by
the
twins
which
i
should
mention
was
called
the
blue
bed
chamber
on
account
of
the
color
of
its
hangings
he
found
the
door
just
ajar
wishing
to
make
an
effective
entrance
he
flung
it
wide
open
when
a
heavy
jug
of
water
fell
right
down
on
him
wetting
him
to
the
skin
and
just
missing
his
left
shoulder
by
a
couple
of
inches
at
the
same
moment
he
heard
stifled
shrieks
of
laughter
proceeding
from
the
bed
the
shock
to
his
nervous
system
was
so
great
that
he
fled
back
to
his
room
as
hard
as
he
could
go
and
the
next
day
he
was
laid
up
with
a
severe
cold
the
only
thing
that
at
all
consoled
him
in
the
whole
affair
was
the
fact
that
he
had
not
brought
his
head
with
him
for
had
he
done
so
the
consequences
might
have
been
very
serious
he
now
gave
up
all
hope
of
ever
frightening
this
rude
american
family
and
contented
himself
as
a
rule
with
creeping
about
the
passages
in
list
slippers
with
a
thick
red
muffler
round
his
throat
for
fear
of
draughts
and
a
small
arquebus
in
case
he
should
be
attacked
by
the
twins
the
final
blow
he
received
occurred
on
the
of
september
he
had
gone
downstairs
to
the
great
feeling
sure
that
there
at
any
rate
he
would
be
quite
unmolested
and
was
amusing
himself
by
making
satirical
remarks
on
the
large
saroni
photographs
of
the
united
states
minister
and
his
wife
which
had
now
taken
the
place
of
the
canterville
family
pictures
he
was
simply
but
neatly
clad
in
a
long
shroud
spotted
with
churchyard
mold
had
tied
up
his
jaw
with
a
strip
of
yellow
linen
and
carried
a
small
lantern
and
a
sexton
spade
in
fact
he
was
dressed
for
the
character
of
jonas
the
graveless
or
the
of
chertsey
barn
one
of
his
most
remarkable
impersonations
and
one
which
the
cantervilles
had
every
reason
to
remember
as
it
was
the
real
origin
of
their
quarrel
with
their
neighbor
lord
rufford
it
was
about
a
two
in
the
morning
and
as
far
as
he
could
ascertain
no
one
was
stirring
as
he
was
strolling
towards
the
library
however
to
see
if
there
were
any
traces
left
of
the
suddenly
there
leaped
out
on
him
from
a
dark
corner
two
figures
who
waved
their
arms
wildly
above
their
heads
and
shrieked
out
boo
in
his
ear
seized
with
a
panic
which
under
the
circumstances
was
only
natural
he
rushed
for
the
staircase
but
found
washington
otis
waiting
for
him
there
with
the
big
and
being
thus
hemmed
in
by
his
enemies
on
every
side
and
driven
almost
to
bay
he
vanished
into
the
great
iron
stove
which
fortunately
for
him
was
not
lit
and
had
to
make
his
way
home
through
the
flues
and
chimneys
arriving
at
his
own
room
in
a
terrible
state
of
dirt
disorder
and
despair
after
this
he
was
not
seen
again
on
any
nocturnal
expedition
the
twins
lay
in
wait
for
him
on
several
occasions
and
strewed
the
passages
with
nutshells
every
night
to
the
great
annoyance
of
their
parents
and
the
servants
but
it
was
of
no
avail
it
was
quite
evident
that
his
feelings
were
so
wounded
that
he
would
not
appear
otis
consequently
resumed
his
great
work
on
the
history
of
the
democratic
party
on
which
he
had
been
engaged
for
some
years
otis
organized
a
wonderful
which
amazed
the
whole
county
the
boys
took
to
lacrosse
euchre
poker
and
other
american
national
games
and
virginia
rode
about
the
lanes
on
her
pony
accompanied
by
the
young
duke
of
cheshire
who
had
come
to
spend
the
last
week
of
his
holidays
at
canterville
chase
it
was
generally
assumed
that
the
ghost
had
gone
away
and
in
fact
otis
wrote
a
letter
to
that
effect
to
lord
canterville
who
in
reply
expressed
his
great
pleasure
at
the
news
and
sent
his
best
congratulations
to
the
minister
worthy
wife
the
otises
however
were
deceived
for
the
ghost
was
still
in
the
house
and
though
now
almost
an
invalid
was
by
no
means
ready
to
let
matters
rest
particularly
as
he
heard
that
among
the
guests
was
the
young
duke
of
cheshire
whose
lord
francis
stilton
had
once
bet
a
hundred
guineas
with
colonel
carbury
that
he
would
play
dice
with
the
canterville
ghost
and
was
found
the
next
morning
lying
on
the
floor
of
the
in
such
a
helpless
paralytic
state
that
though
he
lived
on
to
a
great
age
he
was
never
able
to
say
anything
again
but
double
sixes
the
story
was
well
known
at
the
time
though
of
course
out
of
respect
to
the
feelings
of
the
two
noble
families
every
attempt
was
made
to
hush
it
up
and
a
full
account
of
all
the
circumstances
connected
with
it
will
be
found
in
the
third
volume
of
lord
of
the
prince
regent
and
his
the
ghost
then
was
naturally
very
anxious
to
show
that
he
had
not
lost
his
influence
over
the
stiltons
with
whom
indeed
he
was
distantly
connected
his
own
first
cousin
having
been
married
secondes
to
the
sieur
de
bulkeley
from
whom
as
everyone
knows
the
dukes
of
cheshire
are
lineally
descended
accordingly
he
made
arrangements
for
appearing
to
virginia
little
lover
in
his
celebrated
impersonation
of
the
vampire
monk
or
the
bloodless
benedictine
a
performance
so
horrible
that
when
old
lady
startup
saw
it
which
she
did
on
one
fatal
new
year
eve
in
the
year
she
went
off
into
the
most
piercing
shrieks
which
culminated
in
violent
apoplexy
and
died
in
three
days
after
disinheriting
the
cantervilles
who
were
her
nearest
relations
and
leaving
all
her
money
to
her
london
apothecary
at
the
last
moment
however
his
terror
of
the
twins
prevented
his
leaving
his
room
and
the
little
duke
slept
in
peace
under
the
great
feathered
canopy
in
the
royal
bedchamber
and
dreamed
of
virginia
v
a
few
days
after
this
virginia
and
her
cavalier
went
out
riding
on
brockley
meadows
where
she
tore
her
habit
so
badly
in
getting
through
a
hedge
that
on
their
return
home
she
made
up
her
mind
to
go
up
by
the
back
staircase
so
as
not
to
be
seen
as
she
was
running
past
the
tapestry
chamber
the
door
of
which
happened
to
be
open
she
fancied
she
saw
someone
inside
and
thinking
it
was
her
mother
maid
who
sometimes
used
to
bring
her
work
there
looked
in
to
ask
her
to
mend
her
habit
to
her
immense
surprise
however
it
was
the
canterville
ghost
himself
he
was
sitting
by
the
window
watching
the
ruined
gold
of
the
yellowing
trees
fly
through
the
air
and
the
red
leaves
dancing
madly
down
the
long
avenue
his
head
was
leaning
on
his
hand
and
his
whole
attitude
was
one
of
extreme
depression
indeed
so
forlorn
and
so
much
out
of
repair
did
he
look
that
little
virginia
whose
first
idea
had
been
to
run
away
and
lock
herself
in
her
room
was
filled
with
pity
and
determined
to
try
and
comfort
him
so
light
was
her
footfall
and
so
deep
his
melancholy
that
he
was
not
aware
of
her
presence
till
she
spoke
to
him
i
am
so
sorry
for
you
she
said
but
my
brothers
are
going
back
to
eton
and
then
if
you
behave
yourself
no
one
will
annoy
you
it
is
absurd
asking
me
to
behave
myself
he
answered
looking
round
in
astonishment
at
the
pretty
little
girl
who
had
ventured
to
address
him
quite
absurd
i
must
rattle
my
chains
and
groan
through
keyholes
and
walk
about
at
night
if
that
is
what
you
mean
it
is
my
only
reason
for
existing
it
is
no
reason
at
all
for
existing
and
you
know
you
have
been
very
wicked
umney
told
us
the
first
day
we
arrived
here
that
you
had
killed
your
wife
well
i
quite
admit
it
said
the
ghost
petulantly
but
it
was
a
purely
family
matter
and
concerned
no
one
else
it
is
very
wrong
to
kill
anyone
said
virginia
who
at
times
had
a
sweet
puritan
gravity
caught
from
some
old
new
england
ancestor
oh
i
hate
the
cheap
severity
of
abstract
ethics
my
wife
was
very
plain
never
had
my
ruffs
properly
starched
and
knew
nothing
about
cookery
why
there
was
a
buck
i
had
shot
in
hogley
woods
a
magnificent
pricket
and
do
you
know
how
she
had
it
sent
to
table
however
it
is
no
matter
now
for
it
is
all
over
and
i
do
think
it
was
very
nice
of
her
brothers
to
starve
me
to
death
though
i
did
kill
her
starve
you
to
death
oh
ghost
i
mean
sir
simon
are
you
hungry
i
have
a
sandwich
in
my
case
would
you
like
it
no
thank
you
i
never
eat
anything
now
but
it
is
very
kind
of
you
all
the
same
and
you
are
much
nicer
than
the
rest
of
your
horrid
rude
vulgar
dishonest
family
stop
cried
virginia
stamping
her
foot
it
is
you
who
are
rude
and
horrid
and
vulgar
and
as
for
dishonesty
you
know
you
stole
the
paints
out
of
my
box
to
try
and
furbish
up
that
ridiculous
in
the
library
first
you
took
all
my
reds
including
the
vermilion
and
i
could
do
any
more
sunsets
then
you
took
the
and
the
and
finally
i
had
nothing
left
but
indigo
and
chinese
white
and
could
only
do
moonlight
scenes
which
are
always
depressing
to
look
at
and
not
at
all
easy
to
paint
i
never
told
on
you
though
i
was
very
much
annoyed
and
it
was
most
ridiculous
the
whole
thing
for
who
ever
heard
of
blood
well
really
said
the
ghost
rather
meekly
what
was
i
to
do
it
is
a
very
difficult
thing
to
get
real
blood
nowadays
and
as
your
brother
began
it
all
with
his
paragon
detergent
i
certainly
saw
no
reason
why
i
should
not
have
your
paints
as
for
color
that
is
always
a
matter
of
taste
the
cantervilles
have
blue
blood
for
instance
the
very
bluest
in
england
but
i
know
you
americans
do
care
for
things
of
this
kind
you
know
nothing
about
it
and
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
emigrate
and
improve
your
mind
my
father
will
be
only
too
happy
to
give
you
a
free
passage
and
though
there
is
a
heavy
duty
on
spirits
of
every
kind
there
will
be
no
difficulty
about
the
custom
house
as
the
officers
are
all
democrats
once
in
new
york
you
are
sure
to
be
a
great
success
i
know
lots
of
people
there
who
would
give
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
to
have
a
grandfather
and
much
more
than
that
to
have
a
family
ghost
i
do
think
i
should
like
america
i
suppose
because
we
have
no
ruins
and
no
curiosities
said
virginia
satirically
no
ruins
no
curiosities
answered
the
ghost
you
have
your
navy
and
your
manners
good
evening
i
will
go
and
ask
papa
to
get
the
twins
an
extra
holiday
please
do
go
miss
virginia
he
cried
i
am
so
lonely
and
so
unhappy
and
i
really
do
know
what
to
do
i
want
to
go
to
sleep
and
i
can
not
that
quite
absurd
you
have
merely
to
go
to
bed
and
blow
out
the
candle
it
is
very
difficult
sometimes
to
keep
awake
especially
at
church
but
there
is
no
difficulty
at
all
about
sleeping
why
even
babies
know
how
to
do
that
and
they
are
not
very
clever
i
have
not
slept
for
three
hundred
years
he
said
sadly
and
virginia
beautiful
blue
eyes
opened
in
wonder
for
three
hundred
years
i
have
not
slept
and
i
am
so
tired
virginia
grew
quite
grave
and
her
little
lips
trembled
like
she
came
towards
him
and
kneeling
down
at
his
side
looked
up
into
his
old
withered
face
poor
poor
ghost
she
murmured
have
you
no
place
where
you
can
sleep
far
away
beyond
the
pinewoods
he
answered
in
a
low
dreamy
voice
there
is
a
little
garden
there
the
grass
grows
long
and
deep
there
are
the
great
white
stars
of
the
hemlock
flower
there
the
nightingale
sings
all
night
long
all
night
long
he
sings
and
the
cold
crystal
moon
looks
down
and
the
spreads
out
its
giant
arms
over
the
sleepers
virginia
eyes
grew
dim
with
tears
and
she
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
you
mean
the
garden
of
death
she
whispered
yes
death
death
must
be
so
beautiful
to
lie
in
the
soft
brown
earth
with
the
grasses
waving
above
one
head
and
listen
to
silence
to
have
no
yesterday
and
no
to
forget
time
to
forget
life
to
be
at
peace
you
can
help
me
you
can
open
for
me
the
portals
of
house
for
love
is
always
with
you
and
love
is
stronger
than
death
is
virginia
trembled
a
cold
shudder
ran
through
her
and
for
a
few
moments
there
was
silence
she
felt
as
if
she
was
in
a
terrible
dream
then
the
ghost
spoke
again
and
his
voice
sounded
like
the
sighing
of
the
wind
have
you
ever
read
the
old
prophecy
on
the
library
window
oh
often
cried
the
little
girl
looking
up
i
know
it
quite
well
it
is
painted
in
curious
black
letters
and
is
difficult
to
read
there
are
only
six
lines
a
golden
girl
can
win
prayer
from
out
the
lips
of
sin
when
the
barren
almond
bears
and
a
little
child
gives
away
its
tears
then
shall
all
the
house
be
still
and
peace
come
to
canterville
but
i
do
know
what
they
mean
they
mean
he
said
sadly
that
you
must
weep
with
me
for
my
sins
because
i
have
no
tears
and
pray
with
me
for
my
soul
because
i
have
no
faith
and
then
if
you
have
always
been
sweet
and
good
and
gentle
the
angel
of
death
will
have
mercy
on
me
you
will
see
fearful
shapes
in
darkness
and
wicked
voices
will
whisper
in
your
ear
but
they
will
not
harm
you
for
against
the
purity
of
a
little
child
the
powers
of
hell
can
not
prevail
virginia
made
no
answer
and
the
ghost
wrung
his
hands
in
wild
despair
as
he
looked
down
at
her
bowed
golden
head
suddenly
she
stood
up
very
pale
and
with
a
strange
light
in
her
eyes
i
am
not
afraid
she
said
firmly
and
i
will
ask
the
angel
to
have
mercy
on
you
he
rose
from
his
seat
with
a
faint
cry
of
joy
and
taking
her
hand
bent
over
it
with
grace
and
kissed
it
his
fingers
were
as
cold
as
ice
and
his
lips
burned
like
fire
but
virginia
did
not
falter
as
he
led
her
across
the
dusky
room
on
the
faded
green
tapestry
were
broidered
little
huntsmen
they
blew
their
tasseled
horns
and
with
their
tiny
hands
waved
to
her
to
go
back
go
back
little
virginia
they
cried
go
back
but
the
ghost
clutched
her
hand
more
tightly
and
she
shut
her
eyes
against
them
horrible
animals
with
lizard
tails
and
goggle
eyes
blinked
at
her
from
the
carven
and
murmured
beware
little
virginia
beware
we
may
never
see
you
again
but
the
ghost
glided
on
more
swiftly
and
virginia
did
not
listen
when
they
reached
the
end
of
the
room
he
stopped
and
muttered
some
words
she
could
not
understand
she
opened
her
eyes
and
saw
the
wall
slowly
fading
away
like
a
mist
and
a
great
black
cavern
in
front
of
her
a
bitter
cold
wind
swept
round
them
and
she
felt
something
pulling
at
her
dress
quick
quick
cried
the
ghost
or
it
will
be
too
late
and
in
a
moment
the
wainscoting
had
closed
behind
them
and
the
tapestry
chamber
was
empty
vi
about
ten
minutes
later
the
bell
rang
for
tea
and
as
virginia
did
not
come
down
otis
sent
up
one
of
the
footmen
to
tell
her
after
a
little
time
he
returned
and
said
that
he
could
not
find
miss
virginia
anywhere
as
she
was
in
the
habit
of
going
out
to
the
garden
every
evening
to
get
flowers
for
the
otis
was
not
at
all
alarmed
at
first
but
when
six
struck
and
virginia
did
not
appear
she
became
really
agitated
and
sent
the
boys
out
to
look
for
her
while
she
herself
and
otis
searched
every
room
in
the
house
at
six
the
boys
came
back
and
said
that
they
could
find
no
trace
of
their
sister
anywhere
they
were
all
now
in
the
greatest
state
of
excitement
and
did
not
know
what
to
do
when
otis
suddenly
remembered
that
some
few
days
before
he
had
given
a
band
of
gipsies
permission
to
camp
in
the
park
he
accordingly
at
once
set
off
for
blackfell
hollow
where
he
knew
they
were
accompanied
by
his
eldest
son
and
two
of
the
the
little
duke
of
cheshire
who
was
perfectly
frantic
with
anxiety
begged
hard
to
be
allowed
to
go
too
but
otis
would
not
allow
him
as
he
was
afraid
there
might
be
a
scuffle
on
arriving
at
the
spot
however
he
found
that
the
gipsies
had
gone
and
it
was
evident
that
their
departure
had
been
rather
sudden
as
the
fire
was
still
burning
and
some
plates
were
lying
on
the
grass
having
sent
off
washington
and
the
two
men
to
scour
the
district
he
ran
home
and
dispatched
telegrams
to
all
the
police
inspectors
in
the
county
telling
them
to
look
out
for
a
little
girl
who
had
been
kidnapped
by
tramps
or
gipsies
he
then
ordered
his
horse
to
be
brought
round
and
after
insisting
on
his
wife
and
the
three
boys
sitting
down
to
dinner
rode
off
down
the
ascot
road
with
a
groom
he
had
hardly
however
gone
a
couple
of
miles
when
he
heard
somebody
galloping
after
him
and
looking
round
saw
the
little
duke
coming
up
on
his
pony
with
his
face
very
flushed
and
no
hat
i
awfully
sorry
otis
gasped
out
the
boy
but
i
ca
eat
any
dinner
as
long
as
virginia
is
lost
please
do
be
angry
with
me
if
you
had
let
us
be
engaged
last
year
there
would
never
have
been
all
this
trouble
you
wo
send
me
back
will
you
i
ca
go
i
wo
go
the
minister
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
handsome
young
scapegrace
and
was
a
good
deal
touched
at
his
devotion
to
virginia
so
leaning
down
from
his
horse
he
patted
him
kindly
on
the
shoulders
and
said
well
cecil
if
you
wo
go
back
i
suppose
you
must
come
with
me
but
i
must
get
you
a
hat
at
ascot
oh
bother
my
hat
i
want
virginia
cried
the
little
duke
laughing
and
they
galloped
on
to
the
railway
station
there
otis
inquired
of
the
if
anyone
answering
to
the
description
of
virginia
had
been
seen
on
the
platform
but
could
get
no
news
of
her
the
however
wired
up
and
down
the
line
and
assured
him
that
a
strict
watch
would
be
kept
for
her
and
after
having
bought
a
hat
for
the
little
duke
from
a
who
was
just
putting
up
his
shutters
otis
rode
off
to
bexley
a
village
about
four
miles
away
which
he
was
told
was
a
haunt
of
the
gipsies
as
there
was
a
large
common
next
to
it
here
they
roused
up
the
rural
policeman
but
could
get
no
information
from
him
and
after
riding
all
over
the
common
they
turned
their
horses
heads
homewards
and
reached
the
chase
about
eleven
and
almost
they
found
washington
and
the
twins
waiting
for
them
at
the
with
lanterns
as
the
avenue
was
very
dark
not
the
slightest
trace
of
virginia
had
been
discovered
the
gipsies
had
been
caught
on
brockley
meadows
but
she
was
not
with
them
and
they
had
explained
their
sudden
departure
by
saying
that
they
had
mistaken
the
date
of
chorton
fair
and
had
gone
off
in
a
hurry
for
fear
they
should
be
late
indeed
they
had
been
quite
distressed
at
hearing
of
virginia
disappearance
as
they
were
very
grateful
to
otis
for
having
allowed
them
to
camp
in
his
park
and
four
of
their
number
had
stayed
behind
to
help
in
the
search
the
had
been
dragged
and
the
whole
chase
thoroughly
gone
over
but
without
any
result
it
was
evident
that
for
that
night
at
any
rate
virginia
was
lost
to
them
and
it
was
in
a
state
of
the
deepest
depression
that
otis
and
the
boys
walked
up
to
the
house
the
groom
following
behind
with
the
two
horses
and
the
pony
in
the
hall
they
found
a
group
of
frightened
servants
and
lying
on
a
sofa
in
the
library
was
poor
otis
almost
out
of
her
mind
with
terror
and
anxiety
and
having
her
forehead
bathed
with
eau
de
cologne
by
the
old
housekeeper
otis
at
once
insisted
on
her
having
something
to
eat
and
ordered
up
supper
for
the
whole
party
it
was
a
melancholy
meal
as
hardly
anyone
spoke
and
even
the
twins
were
awestruck
and
subdued
as
they
were
very
fond
of
their
sister
when
they
had
finished
otis
in
spite
of
the
entreaties
of
the
little
duke
ordered
them
all
to
bed
saying
that
nothing
more
could
be
done
that
night
and
that
he
would
telegraph
in
the
morning
to
scotland
yard
for
some
detectives
to
be
sent
down
immediately
just
as
they
were
passing
out
of
the
midnight
began
to
boom
from
the
clock
tower
and
when
the
last
stroke
sounded
they
heard
a
crash
and
a
sudden
shrill
cry
a
dreadful
peal
of
thunder
shook
the
house
a
strain
of
unearthly
music
floated
through
the
air
a
panel
at
the
top
of
the
staircase
flew
back
with
a
loud
noise
and
out
on
the
landing
looking
very
pale
and
white
with
a
little
casket
in
her
hand
stepped
virginia
in
a
moment
they
had
all
rushed
up
to
her
otis
clasped
her
passionately
in
her
arms
the
duke
smothered
her
with
violent
kisses
and
the
twins
executed
a
wild
round
the
group
good
heavens
child
where
have
you
been
said
otis
rather
angrily
thinking
that
she
had
been
playing
some
foolish
trick
on
them
cecil
and
i
have
been
riding
all
over
the
country
looking
for
you
and
your
mother
has
been
frightened
to
death
you
must
never
play
these
practical
jokes
any
more
except
on
the
ghost
except
on
the
ghost
shrieked
the
twins
as
they
capered
about
my
own
darling
thank
god
you
are
found
you
must
never
leave
my
side
again
murmured
otis
as
she
kissed
the
trembling
child
and
smoothed
the
tangled
gold
of
her
hair
papa
said
virginia
quietly
i
have
been
with
the
ghost
he
is
dead
and
you
must
come
and
see
him
he
had
been
very
wicked
but
he
was
really
sorry
for
all
that
he
had
done
and
he
gave
me
this
box
of
beautiful
jewels
before
he
died
the
whole
family
gazed
at
her
in
mute
amazement
but
she
was
quite
grave
and
serious
and
turning
round
she
led
them
through
the
opening
in
the
wainscoting
down
a
narrow
secret
corridor
washington
following
with
a
lighted
candle
which
he
had
caught
up
from
the
table
finally
they
came
to
a
great
oak
door
studded
with
rusty
nails
when
virginia
touched
it
it
swung
back
on
its
heavy
hinges
and
they
found
themselves
in
a
little
low
room
with
a
vaulted
ceiling
and
one
tiny
grated
window
embedded
in
the
wall
was
a
huge
iron
ring
and
chained
to
it
was
a
gaunt
skeleton
that
was
stretched
out
at
full
length
on
the
stone
floor
and
seemed
to
be
trying
to
grasp
with
its
long
fleshless
fingers
an
trencher
and
ewer
that
were
placed
just
out
of
its
reach
the
jug
had
evidently
been
once
filled
with
water
as
it
was
covered
inside
with
green
mold
there
was
nothing
on
the
trencher
but
a
pile
of
dust
virginia
knelt
down
beside
the
skeleton
and
folding
her
little
hands
together
began
to
pray
silently
while
the
rest
of
the
party
looked
on
in
wonder
at
the
terrible
tragedy
whose
secret
was
now
disclosed
to
them
hallo
suddenly
exclaimed
one
of
the
twins
who
had
been
looking
out
of
the
window
to
try
and
discover
in
what
wing
of
the
house
the
room
was
situated
hallo
the
old
withered
has
blossomed
i
can
see
the
flowers
quite
plainly
in
the
moonlight
god
has
forgiven
him
said
virginia
gravely
as
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
a
beautiful
light
seemed
to
illumine
her
face
what
an
angel
you
are
cried
the
young
duke
and
he
put
his
arm
round
her
neck
and
kissed
her
vii
four
days
after
these
curious
incidents
a
funeral
started
from
canterville
chase
at
about
eleven
at
night
the
hearse
was
drawn
by
eight
black
horses
each
of
which
carried
on
its
head
a
great
tuft
of
nodding
and
the
leaden
coffin
was
covered
by
a
rich
purple
pall
on
which
was
embroidered
in
gold
the
canterville
by
the
side
of
the
hearse
and
the
coaches
walked
the
servants
with
lighted
torches
and
the
whole
procession
was
wonderfully
impressive
lord
canterville
was
the
chief
mourner
having
come
up
specially
from
wales
to
attend
the
funeral
and
sat
in
the
first
carriage
along
with
little
virginia
then
came
the
united
states
minister
and
his
wife
then
washington
and
the
three
boys
and
in
the
last
carriage
was
umney
it
was
generally
felt
that
as
she
had
been
frightened
by
the
ghost
for
more
than
fifty
years
of
her
life
she
had
a
right
to
see
the
last
of
him
a
deep
grave
had
been
dug
in
the
corner
of
the
churchyard
just
under
the
old
and
the
service
was
read
in
the
most
impressive
manner
by
the
rev
augustus
dampier
when
the
ceremony
was
over
the
servants
according
to
an
old
custom
observed
in
the
canterville
family
extinguished
their
torches
and
as
the
coffin
was
being
lowered
into
the
grave
virginia
stepped
forward
and
laid
on
it
a
large
cross
made
of
white
and
pink
as
she
did
so
the
moon
came
out
from
behind
a
cloud
and
flooded
with
its
silent
silver
the
little
churchyard
and
from
a
distant
copse
a
nightingale
began
to
sing
she
thought
of
the
ghost
description
of
the
garden
of
death
her
eyes
became
dim
with
tears
and
she
hardly
spoke
a
word
during
the
drive
home
the
next
morning
before
lord
canterville
went
up
to
town
otis
had
an
interview
with
him
on
the
subject
of
the
jewels
the
ghost
had
given
to
virginia
they
were
perfectly
magnificent
especially
a
certain
ruby
necklace
with
old
venetian
setting
which
was
really
a
superb
specimen
of
work
and
their
value
was
so
great
that
otis
felt
considerable
scruples
about
allowing
his
daughter
to
accept
them
my
lord
he
said
i
know
that
in
this
country
mortmain
is
held
to
apply
to
trinkets
as
well
as
to
land
and
it
is
quite
clear
to
me
that
these
jewels
are
or
should
be
heirlooms
in
your
family
i
must
beg
you
accordingly
to
take
them
to
london
with
you
and
to
regard
them
simply
as
a
portion
of
your
property
which
has
been
restored
to
you
under
certain
strange
conditions
as
for
my
daughter
she
is
merely
a
child
and
has
as
yet
i
am
glad
to
say
but
little
interest
in
such
appurtenances
of
idle
luxury
i
am
also
informed
by
otis
who
i
may
say
is
no
mean
authority
upon
art
having
had
the
privilege
of
spending
several
winters
in
boston
when
she
was
a
girl
that
these
gems
are
of
great
monetary
worth
and
if
offered
for
sale
would
fetch
a
tall
price
under
these
circumstances
lord
canterville
i
feel
sure
that
you
will
recognize
how
impossible
it
would
be
for
me
to
allow
them
to
remain
in
the
possession
of
any
member
of
my
family
and
indeed
all
such
vain
gauds
and
toys
however
suitable
or
necessary
to
the
dignity
of
the
british
aristocracy
would
be
completely
out
of
place
among
those
who
have
been
brought
up
on
the
severe
and
i
believe
immortal
principles
of
republican
simplicity
perhaps
i
should
mention
that
virginia
is
very
anxious
that
you
should
allow
her
to
retain
the
box
as
a
memento
of
your
unfortunate
but
misguided
ancestor
as
it
is
extremely
old
and
consequently
a
good
deal
out
of
repair
you
may
perhaps
think
fit
to
comply
with
her
request
for
my
own
part
i
confess
i
am
a
good
deal
surprised
to
find
a
child
of
mine
expressing
sympathy
with
medievalism
in
any
form
and
can
only
account
for
it
by
the
fact
that
virginia
was
born
in
one
of
your
london
suburbs
shortly
after
otis
had
returned
from
a
trip
to
athens
lord
canterville
listened
very
gravely
to
the
worthy
minister
speech
pulling
his
gray
moustache
now
and
then
to
hide
an
involuntary
smile
and
when
otis
had
ended
he
shook
him
cordially
by
the
hand
and
said
my
dear
sir
your
charming
little
daughter
rendered
my
unlucky
ancestor
sir
simon
a
very
important
service
and
i
and
my
family
are
much
indebted
to
her
for
her
marvelous
courage
and
pluck
the
jewels
are
clearly
hers
and
egad
i
believe
that
if
i
were
heartless
enough
to
take
them
from
her
the
wicked
old
fellow
would
be
out
of
his
grave
in
a
fortnight
leading
me
the
devil
of
a
life
as
for
their
being
heirlooms
nothing
is
an
heirloom
that
is
not
so
mentioned
in
a
will
or
legal
document
and
the
existence
of
these
jewels
has
been
quite
unknown
i
assure
you
i
have
no
more
claim
on
them
than
your
butler
and
when
miss
virginia
grows
up
i
dare
say
she
will
be
pleased
to
have
pretty
things
to
wear
besides
you
forget
otis
that
you
took
the
furniture
and
the
ghost
at
a
valuation
and
anything
that
belonged
to
the
ghost
passed
at
once
into
your
possession
as
whatever
activity
sir
simon
may
have
shown
in
the
corridor
at
night
in
point
of
law
he
was
really
dead
and
you
acquired
his
property
by
purchase
otis
was
a
good
deal
distressed
at
lord
canterville
refusal
and
begged
him
to
reconsider
his
decision
but
the
peer
was
quite
firm
and
finally
induced
the
minister
to
allow
his
daughter
to
retain
the
present
the
ghost
had
given
her
and
when
in
the
spring
of
the
young
duchess
of
cheshire
was
presented
at
the
queen
first
on
the
occasion
of
her
marriage
her
jewels
were
the
universal
theme
of
admiration
for
virginia
received
the
coronet
which
is
the
reward
of
all
good
little
american
girls
and
was
married
to
her
as
soon
as
he
came
of
age
they
were
both
so
charming
and
they
loved
each
other
so
much
that
everyone
was
delighted
at
the
match
except
the
old
marchioness
of
dumbleton
who
had
tried
to
catch
the
duke
for
one
of
her
seven
unmarried
daughters
and
had
given
no
less
than
three
expensive
for
that
purpose
and
strange
to
say
otis
himself
otis
was
extremely
fond
of
the
young
duke
personally
but
theoretically
he
objected
to
titles
and
to
use
his
own
words
was
not
without
apprehension
lest
amid
the
enervating
influences
of
a
aristocracy
the
true
principles
of
republican
simplicity
should
be
forgotten
his
objections
however
were
completely
and
i
believe
that
when
he
walked
up
the
aisle
of
george
hanover
square
with
his
daughter
leaning
on
his
arm
there
was
not
a
prouder
man
in
the
whole
length
and
breadth
of
england
the
duke
and
duchess
after
the
honeymoon
was
over
went
down
to
canterville
chase
and
on
the
day
after
their
arrival
they
walked
over
in
the
afternoon
to
the
lonely
churchyard
by
the
pinewoods
there
had
been
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
at
first
about
the
inscription
on
sir
simon
tombstone
but
finally
it
had
been
decided
to
engrave
on
it
simply
the
initials
of
the
old
gentleman
name
and
the
verse
from
the
library
window
the
duchess
had
brought
with
her
some
lovely
roses
which
she
strewed
upon
the
grave
and
after
they
had
stood
by
it
for
some
time
they
strolled
into
the
ruined
chancel
of
the
old
abbey
there
the
duchess
sat
down
on
a
fallen
pillar
while
her
husband
lay
at
her
feet
smoking
a
cigarette
and
looking
up
at
her
beautiful
eyes
suddenly
he
threw
his
cigarette
away
took
hold
of
her
hand
and
said
to
her
virginia
a
wife
should
have
no
secrets
from
her
husband
dear
cecil
i
have
no
secrets
from
you
yes
you
have
he
answered
smiling
you
have
never
told
me
what
happened
to
you
when
you
were
locked
up
with
the
ghost
i
have
never
told
anyone
cecil
said
virginia
gravely
i
know
that
but
you
might
tell
me
please
do
ask
me
cecil
i
can
not
tell
you
poor
sir
simon
i
owe
him
a
great
deal
yes
do
laugh
cecil
i
really
do
he
made
me
see
what
life
is
and
what
death
signifies
and
why
love
is
stronger
than
both
the
duke
rose
and
kissed
his
wife
lovingly
you
can
have
your
secret
as
long
as
i
have
your
heart
he
murmured
you
have
always
had
that
cecil
and
you
will
tell
our
children
some
day
wo
you
virginia
blushed
the
by
gelett
burgess
from
the
april
by
permission
of
john
brisben
walker
and
gelett
burgess
the
by
gelett
burgess
my
attention
was
first
called
to
the
possibility
of
manufacturing
a
practicable
by
a
agent
in
san
francisco
there
one
thing
he
said
that
affects
city
property
here
in
a
curious
way
you
know
we
have
a
good
many
murders
and
as
a
consequence
certain
houses
attain
a
very
sensational
and
undesirable
reputation
these
houses
it
is
almost
impossible
to
let
you
can
scarcely
get
a
decent
family
to
occupy
them
then
we
have
a
great
many
places
said
to
be
haunted
these
were
dead
timber
on
my
hands
until
i
happened
to
notice
that
the
japanese
have
no
objections
to
spooks
now
whenever
i
have
such
a
building
to
rent
i
let
it
to
japs
at
a
nominal
figure
and
after
they
taken
the
curse
off
i
raise
the
rent
the
japs
move
out
the
place
is
renovated
and
in
the
market
again
the
subject
interested
me
for
i
am
not
only
a
scientist
but
a
speculative
philosopher
as
well
the
investigation
of
those
phenomena
that
lie
upon
the
threshold
of
the
great
unknown
has
always
been
my
favorite
field
of
research
i
believed
even
then
that
the
oriental
mind
working
along
different
lines
than
those
which
we
pursue
has
attained
knowledge
that
we
know
little
of
thinking
therefore
that
these
japs
might
have
some
secret
inherited
from
their
misty
past
i
examined
into
the
matter
i
shall
not
trouble
you
with
a
narration
of
the
incidents
which
led
up
to
my
acquaintance
with
hoku
yamanochi
suffice
it
to
say
that
i
found
in
him
a
friend
who
was
willing
to
share
with
me
his
whole
lore
of
i
call
it
this
advisedly
for
science
as
we
occidentals
use
the
term
has
to
do
only
with
the
laws
of
matter
and
sensation
our
scientific
men
in
fact
recognize
the
existence
of
nothing
else
the
buddhistic
philosophy
however
goes
further
according
to
its
theories
the
soul
is
sevenfold
consisting
of
different
shells
or
envelopes
something
like
an
onion
which
are
shed
as
life
passes
from
the
material
to
the
spiritual
state
the
first
or
lowest
of
these
is
the
corporeal
body
which
after
death
decays
and
perishes
next
comes
the
vital
principle
which
departing
from
the
body
dissipates
itself
like
an
odor
and
is
lost
less
gross
than
this
is
the
astral
body
which
although
immaterial
yet
lies
near
to
the
consistency
of
matter
this
astral
shape
released
from
the
body
at
death
remains
for
a
while
in
its
earthly
environment
still
preserving
more
or
less
definitely
the
imprint
of
the
form
which
it
inhabited
it
is
this
relic
of
a
past
material
personality
this
outworn
shell
that
appears
when
galvanized
into
an
appearance
of
life
partly
materialized
as
a
ghost
it
is
not
the
soul
that
returns
for
the
soul
which
is
immortal
is
composed
of
the
four
higher
spiritual
essences
that
surround
the
ego
and
are
carried
on
into
the
next
life
these
astral
bodies
therefore
fail
to
terrify
the
buddhists
who
know
them
only
as
shadows
with
no
real
volition
the
japs
in
point
of
fact
have
learned
how
to
exterminate
them
there
is
a
certain
powder
hoku
informed
me
which
when
burnt
in
their
presence
transforms
them
from
the
rarefied
or
condition
to
the
state
of
matter
the
ghost
so
to
speak
is
precipitated
into
and
becomes
a
material
shape
which
can
easily
be
disposed
of
in
this
state
it
is
confined
and
allowed
to
disintegrate
slowly
where
it
can
cause
no
further
annoyance
this
explanation
piqued
my
curiosity
which
was
not
to
be
satisfied
until
i
had
seen
the
japanese
method
applied
it
was
not
long
before
i
had
an
opportunity
a
particularly
revolting
murder
having
been
committed
in
san
francisco
my
friend
hoku
yamanochi
applied
for
the
house
and
after
the
police
had
finished
their
examination
he
was
permitted
to
occupy
it
for
a
at
the
ridiculous
price
of
three
dollars
a
month
he
invited
me
to
share
his
quarters
which
were
large
and
luxuriously
furnished
for
a
week
nothing
abnormal
occurred
then
one
night
i
was
awakened
by
terrifying
groans
followed
by
a
shriek
which
seemed
to
emerge
from
a
large
closet
in
my
room
the
scene
of
the
late
atrocity
i
confess
that
i
had
all
the
covers
pulled
over
my
head
and
was
shivering
with
horror
when
my
japanese
friend
entered
wearing
a
pair
of
pajamas
hearing
his
voice
i
peeped
forth
to
see
him
smiling
reassuringly
you
some
kind
of
very
foolish
fellow
he
said
i
show
you
how
to
fix
him
he
took
from
his
pocket
three
conical
red
pastils
placed
them
upon
a
saucer
and
lighted
them
then
holding
the
fuming
dish
in
one
outstretched
hand
he
walked
to
the
closed
door
and
opened
it
the
shrieks
burst
out
afresh
and
as
i
recalled
the
appalling
details
of
the
scene
which
had
occurred
in
this
very
room
only
five
weeks
ago
i
shuddered
at
his
temerity
but
he
was
quite
calm
soon
i
saw
the
form
of
the
recent
victim
dart
from
the
closet
she
crawled
under
my
bed
and
ran
about
the
room
endeavoring
to
escape
but
was
pursued
by
hoku
who
waved
his
smoking
plate
with
indefatigable
patience
and
dexterity
at
last
he
had
her
cornered
and
the
specter
was
caught
behind
a
curtain
of
odorous
fumes
slowly
the
figure
grew
more
distinct
assuming
the
consistency
of
a
heavy
vapor
shrinking
somewhat
in
the
operation
hoku
now
hurriedly
turned
to
me
you
hully
up
bling
me
one
pair
bellows
pletty
quick
he
commanded
i
ran
into
his
room
and
brought
the
bellows
from
his
fireplace
these
he
pressed
flat
and
then
carefully
inserting
one
toe
of
the
ghost
into
the
nozzle
and
opening
the
handles
steadily
he
sucked
in
a
portion
of
the
unfortunate
woman
anatomy
and
dexterously
squirted
the
vapor
into
a
large
jar
which
had
been
placed
in
the
room
for
the
purpose
two
more
operations
were
necessary
to
withdraw
the
phantom
completely
from
the
corner
and
empty
it
into
the
jar
at
last
the
transfer
was
effected
and
the
receptacle
securely
stoppered
and
sealed
in
hoku
explained
to
me
old
pliests
sucked
ghost
with
mouth
and
spit
him
to
inside
of
vase
with
acculacy
method
more
better
for
stomach
and
epiglottis
how
long
will
this
ghost
keep
i
inquired
oh
about
four
five
hundled
years
maybe
was
his
reply
ghost
now
change
from
spilit
to
matter
and
comes
under
legality
of
matter
as
usual
science
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
her
i
asked
send
him
to
buddhist
temple
in
japan
old
pliest
use
him
for
high
celemony
was
the
answer
my
next
desire
was
to
obtain
some
of
hoku
yamanochi
and
analyze
it
for
a
while
it
defied
my
attempts
but
after
many
months
of
patient
research
i
discovered
that
it
could
be
produced
in
all
its
essential
qualities
by
means
of
a
fusion
of
formaldehyde
and
hypophenyltrybrompropionic
acid
in
an
electrified
vacuum
with
this
product
i
began
a
series
of
interesting
experiments
as
it
became
necessary
for
me
to
discover
the
habitat
of
ghosts
in
considerable
numbers
i
joined
the
american
society
for
psychical
research
thus
securing
desirable
information
in
regard
to
haunted
houses
these
i
visited
persistently
until
my
powder
was
perfected
and
had
been
proved
efficacious
for
the
capture
of
any
ordinary
phantom
for
a
while
i
contented
myself
with
the
mere
sterilization
of
these
specters
but
as
i
became
surer
of
success
i
began
to
attempt
the
transfer
of
ghosts
to
receptacles
wherein
they
could
be
transported
and
studied
at
my
leisure
classified
and
preserved
for
future
reference
hoku
bellows
i
soon
discarded
in
favor
of
a
and
eventually
i
had
constructed
one
of
my
own
of
a
pattern
which
enabled
me
to
inhale
an
entire
ghost
at
a
single
stroke
with
this
powerful
instrument
i
was
able
to
compress
even
an
adult
ghost
into
a
bottle
in
the
neck
of
which
a
sensitive
valve
patented
prevented
the
specter
from
emerging
during
process
my
invention
was
not
yet
however
quite
satisfactory
while
i
had
no
trouble
in
securing
ghosts
of
recent
creation
spirits
that
is
who
were
yet
of
almost
the
consistency
of
matter
on
several
of
my
trips
abroad
in
search
of
material
i
found
in
old
manor
houses
or
ruined
castles
many
specters
so
ancient
that
they
had
become
highly
rarefied
and
tenuous
being
at
times
scarcely
visible
to
the
naked
eye
such
elusive
spirits
are
able
to
pass
through
walls
and
elude
pursuit
with
ease
it
became
necessary
for
me
to
obtain
some
instrument
by
which
their
capture
could
be
conveniently
effected
the
ordinary
of
commerce
gave
me
the
hint
as
to
how
the
problem
could
be
solved
one
of
these
portable
i
filled
with
the
proper
chemicals
when
inverted
the
ingredients
were
commingled
in
vacuo
and
a
vast
volume
of
gas
was
liberated
this
was
collected
in
the
reservoir
provided
with
a
rubber
tube
having
a
nozzle
at
the
end
the
whole
apparatus
being
strapped
upon
my
back
i
was
enabled
to
direct
a
stream
of
powerful
precipitating
gas
in
any
desired
direction
the
flow
being
under
control
through
the
agency
of
a
small
stopcock
by
means
of
this
i
was
enabled
to
pursue
my
experiments
as
far
as
i
desired
so
far
my
investigations
had
been
purely
scientific
but
before
long
the
commercial
value
of
my
discovery
began
to
interest
me
the
ruinous
effects
of
spectral
visitations
upon
real
estate
induced
me
to
realize
some
pecuniary
reward
from
my
and
i
began
to
advertise
my
business
by
degrees
i
became
known
as
an
expert
in
my
original
line
and
my
professional
services
were
sought
with
as
much
confidence
as
those
of
a
veterinary
surgeon
i
manufactured
the
gerrish
in
several
sizes
and
put
it
on
the
market
following
this
venture
with
the
introduction
of
my
justly
celebrated
gerrish
these
were
made
to
be
kept
in
racks
conveniently
distributed
in
country
houses
for
cases
of
sudden
emergency
a
single
grenade
hurled
at
any
spectral
form
would
in
breaking
liberate
enough
formaldybrom
to
coagulate
the
most
perverse
spirit
and
the
resulting
vapor
could
easily
be
removed
from
the
room
by
a
housemaid
with
a
common
broom
this
branch
of
my
business
however
never
proved
profitable
for
the
appearance
of
ghosts
especially
in
the
united
states
is
seldom
anticipated
had
it
been
possible
for
me
to
invent
a
preventive
as
well
as
a
remedy
i
might
now
be
a
millionaire
but
there
are
limits
even
to
modern
science
having
exhausted
the
field
at
home
i
visited
england
in
the
hope
of
securing
customers
among
the
country
families
there
to
my
surprise
i
discovered
that
the
possession
of
a
family
specter
was
considered
as
a
permanent
improvement
to
the
property
and
my
offers
of
service
in
ridding
houses
of
ghostly
tenants
awakened
the
liveliest
resentment
as
a
layer
of
ghosts
i
was
much
lower
in
the
social
scale
than
a
layer
of
carpets
disappointed
and
discouraged
i
returned
home
to
make
a
further
study
of
the
opportunities
of
my
invention
i
had
it
seemed
exhausted
the
possibilities
of
the
use
of
unwelcome
phantoms
could
i
not
i
thought
derive
a
revenue
from
the
traffic
in
desirable
specters
i
decided
to
renew
my
investigations
the
nebulous
spirits
preserved
in
my
laboratory
which
i
had
graded
and
classified
were
you
will
remember
in
a
state
of
suspended
animation
they
were
virtually
embalmed
apparitions
their
inevitable
decay
delayed
rather
than
prevented
the
assorted
ghosts
that
i
had
now
preserved
in
hermetically
sealed
tins
were
thus
in
a
state
of
unstable
equilibrium
the
tins
once
opened
and
the
vapor
allowed
to
dissipate
the
original
astral
body
would
in
time
be
reconstructed
and
the
specter
would
continue
its
previous
career
but
this
process
when
naturally
performed
took
years
the
interval
was
quite
too
long
for
the
phantom
to
be
handled
in
any
commercial
way
my
problem
was
therefore
to
produce
from
my
tinned
essence
of
ghost
a
specter
that
was
capable
of
immediately
going
into
business
and
that
could
haunt
a
house
while
you
wait
it
was
not
until
radium
was
discovered
that
i
approached
the
solution
of
my
great
problem
and
even
then
months
of
indefatigable
labor
were
necessary
before
the
process
was
perfected
it
has
now
been
well
demonstrated
that
the
emanations
of
radiant
energy
sent
forth
by
this
surprising
element
defy
our
former
scientific
conceptions
of
the
constitution
of
matter
it
was
for
me
to
prove
that
the
vibratory
activity
of
radium
whose
amplitudes
and
intensity
are
undoubtedly
effects
a
sort
of
allotropic
modification
in
the
particles
of
that
imponderable
ether
which
seems
to
lie
halfway
between
matter
and
pure
spirit
this
is
as
far
as
i
need
to
go
in
my
explanation
for
a
full
discussion
involves
the
use
of
quaternions
and
the
method
of
least
squares
it
will
be
sufficient
for
the
layman
to
know
that
my
preserved
phantoms
rendered
would
upon
contact
with
the
air
resume
their
spectral
shape
the
possible
extension
of
my
business
now
was
enormous
limited
only
by
the
difficulty
in
collecting
the
necessary
stock
it
was
by
this
time
almost
as
difficult
to
get
ghosts
as
it
was
to
get
radium
finding
that
a
part
of
my
stock
had
spoiled
i
was
now
possessed
of
only
a
few
dozen
cans
of
apparitions
many
of
these
being
of
inferior
quality
i
immediately
set
about
replenishing
my
raw
material
it
was
not
enough
for
me
to
pick
up
a
ghost
here
and
there
as
one
might
get
old
mahogany
i
determined
to
procure
my
phantoms
in
wholesale
lots
accident
favored
my
design
in
an
old
volume
of
i
happened
one
day
to
come
across
an
interesting
article
upon
the
battle
of
waterloo
it
mentioned
incidentally
a
legend
to
the
effect
that
every
year
upon
the
anniversary
of
the
celebrated
victory
spectral
squadrons
had
been
seen
by
the
peasants
charging
battalions
of
ghostly
grenadiers
here
was
my
opportunity
i
made
elaborate
preparations
for
the
capture
of
this
job
lot
of
phantoms
upon
the
next
anniversary
of
the
fight
hard
by
the
fatal
ditch
which
engulfed
napoleon
cavalry
i
stationed
a
corps
of
able
assistants
provided
with
extinguishers
ready
to
enfilade
the
famous
sunken
road
i
stationed
myself
with
a
no
model
with
a
nozzle
directly
in
the
path
which
i
knew
would
be
taken
by
the
advancing
squadron
it
was
a
fine
clear
night
lighted
at
first
by
a
slice
of
new
moon
but
later
dark
except
for
the
pale
illumination
of
the
stars
i
have
seen
many
ghosts
in
my
time
ghosts
in
garden
and
garret
at
noon
at
dusk
at
dawn
phantoms
fanciful
and
specters
sad
and
spectacular
but
never
have
i
seen
such
an
impressive
sight
as
this
nocturnal
charge
of
cuirassiers
galloping
in
goblin
glory
to
their
doom
from
afar
the
french
reserves
presented
the
appearance
of
a
nebulous
mass
like
a
cloud
or
faintly
luminous
shot
with
fluorescent
gleams
as
the
squadron
drew
nearer
in
its
desperate
charge
the
separate
forms
of
the
troopers
shaped
themselves
and
the
galloping
guardsmen
grew
ghastly
with
supernatural
splendor
although
i
knew
them
to
be
immaterial
and
without
mass
or
weight
i
was
terrified
at
their
approach
fearing
to
be
swept
under
the
hoofs
of
the
nightmares
they
rode
like
one
in
a
dream
i
started
to
run
but
in
another
instant
they
were
upon
me
and
i
turned
on
my
stream
of
formaldybrom
then
i
was
overwhelmed
in
a
of
wild
warlike
wraiths
the
column
swept
past
me
over
the
bank
plunging
to
its
historic
fate
the
cut
was
piled
full
of
frenzied
scrambling
specters
as
rank
after
rank
swept
down
into
the
horrid
gut
at
last
the
ditch
swarmed
full
of
writhing
forms
and
the
carnage
was
dire
my
assistants
with
the
extinguishers
stood
firm
and
although
almost
unnerved
by
the
sight
they
summoned
their
courage
and
directed
simultaneous
streams
of
formaldybrom
into
the
struggling
mass
of
fantoms
as
soon
as
my
mind
returned
i
busied
myself
with
the
huge
tanks
i
had
prepared
for
use
as
receivers
these
were
fitted
with
a
mechanism
similar
to
that
employed
in
portable
forges
by
which
the
heavy
vapor
was
sucked
off
luckily
the
night
was
calm
and
i
was
enabled
to
fill
a
dozen
cylinders
with
the
precipitated
ghosts
the
segregation
of
individual
forms
was
of
course
impossible
so
that
men
and
horses
were
mingled
in
a
horrible
mixture
of
fricasseed
spirits
i
intended
subsequently
to
empty
the
soup
into
a
large
reservoir
and
allow
the
separate
specters
to
reform
according
to
the
laws
of
spiritual
cohesion
circumstances
however
prevented
my
ever
accomplishing
this
result
i
returned
home
to
find
awaiting
me
an
order
so
large
and
important
that
i
had
no
time
in
which
to
operate
upon
my
cylinders
of
cavalry
my
patron
was
the
proprietor
of
a
new
sanatorium
for
nervous
invalids
located
near
some
medicinal
springs
in
the
catskills
his
building
was
unfortunately
located
having
been
built
upon
the
site
of
a
summer
hotel
which
while
filled
with
guests
had
burnt
to
the
ground
scores
of
lives
having
been
lost
just
before
the
patients
were
to
be
installed
in
the
new
structure
it
was
found
that
the
place
was
haunted
by
the
victims
of
the
conflagration
to
a
degree
that
rendered
it
inconvenient
as
a
health
resort
my
professional
services
were
requested
therefore
to
render
the
building
a
fitting
abode
for
convalescents
i
wrote
to
the
proprietor
fixing
my
charge
at
five
thousand
dollars
as
my
usual
rate
was
one
hundred
dollars
per
ghost
and
over
a
hundred
lives
were
lost
at
the
fire
i
considered
this
price
reasonable
and
my
offer
was
accepted
the
sanatorium
job
was
finished
in
a
week
i
secured
one
hundred
and
two
superior
spectral
specimens
and
upon
my
return
to
the
laboratory
put
them
up
in
heavily
embossed
tins
with
attractive
labels
in
colors
my
delight
at
the
outcome
of
this
business
was
however
soon
transformed
to
anger
and
indignation
the
proprietor
of
the
health
resort
having
found
that
the
specters
from
his
place
had
been
sold
claimed
a
rebate
upon
the
contract
price
equal
to
the
value
of
the
modified
ghosts
transferred
to
my
possession
this
of
course
i
could
not
allow
i
wrote
demanding
immediate
payment
according
to
our
agreement
and
this
was
peremptorily
refused
the
manager
letter
was
insulting
in
the
extreme
the
pied
piper
of
hamelin
was
not
worse
treated
than
i
felt
myself
to
be
so
like
the
piper
i
determined
to
have
my
revenge
i
got
out
the
twelve
tanks
of
waterloo
from
the
storerooms
and
treated
them
with
radium
for
two
days
these
i
shipped
to
the
catskills
billed
as
hydrogen
gas
then
accompanied
by
two
trustworthy
assistants
i
went
to
the
sanatorium
and
preferred
my
demand
for
payment
in
person
i
was
ejected
with
contumely
before
my
hasty
exit
however
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
noticing
that
the
building
was
filled
with
patients
languid
ladies
were
seated
in
wicker
chairs
upon
the
piazzas
and
frail
anemic
girls
filled
the
corridors
it
was
a
hospital
of
nervous
wrecks
whom
the
slightest
disturbance
would
throw
into
a
panic
i
suppressed
all
my
finer
feelings
of
mercy
and
kindness
and
smiled
grimly
as
i
walked
back
to
the
village
that
night
was
black
and
lowering
fitting
weather
for
the
pandemonium
i
was
about
to
turn
loose
at
ten
i
loaded
a
wagon
with
the
tanks
of
compressed
cohorts
and
muffled
in
heavy
overcoats
we
drove
to
the
sanatorium
all
was
silent
as
we
approached
all
was
dark
the
wagon
concealed
in
a
grove
of
pines
we
took
out
the
tanks
one
by
one
and
placed
them
beneath
the
windows
the
sashes
were
easily
forced
open
and
raised
enough
to
enable
us
to
insert
the
rubber
tubes
connected
with
the
iron
reservoirs
at
midnight
everything
was
ready
i
gave
the
word
and
my
assistants
ran
from
tank
to
tank
opening
the
stopcocks
with
a
hiss
as
of
escaping
steam
the
huge
vessels
emptied
themselves
vomiting
forth
clouds
of
vapor
which
upon
contact
with
the
air
coagulated
into
strange
shapes
as
the
white
of
an
egg
does
when
dropped
into
boiling
water
the
rooms
became
instantly
filled
with
dismembered
shades
of
men
and
horses
seeking
wildly
to
unite
themselves
with
their
proper
parts
legs
ran
down
the
corridors
seeking
their
respective
trunks
arms
writhed
wildly
reaching
for
missing
bodies
heads
rolled
hither
and
yon
in
search
of
native
necks
horses
tails
and
hoofs
whisked
and
hurried
in
quest
of
equine
ownership
until
reorganized
the
spectral
steeds
galloped
about
to
find
their
riders
had
it
been
possible
i
would
have
stopped
this
riot
of
wraiths
long
ere
this
for
it
was
more
awful
than
i
had
anticipated
but
it
was
already
too
late
cowering
in
the
garden
i
began
to
hear
the
screams
of
awakened
and
distracted
patients
in
another
moment
the
front
door
of
the
hotel
was
burst
open
and
a
mob
of
hysterical
women
in
expensive
nightgowns
rushed
out
upon
the
lawn
and
huddled
in
shrieking
groups
i
fled
into
the
night
i
fled
but
napoleon
men
fled
with
me
compelled
by
i
know
not
what
fatal
astral
attraction
perhaps
the
subtle
affinity
of
the
creature
for
the
creator
the
spectral
shells
moved
by
some
mysterious
mechanics
of
spiritual
being
pursued
me
with
fatuous
fury
i
sought
refuge
first
in
my
laboratory
but
even
as
i
approached
a
lurid
glare
foretold
me
of
its
destruction
as
i
drew
nearer
the
whole
was
seen
to
be
in
flames
every
moment
crackling
reports
were
heard
as
the
tins
of
phantasmagoria
exploded
and
threw
their
supernatural
contents
upon
the
night
these
liberated
ghosts
joined
the
army
of
napoleon
outraged
warriors
and
turned
upon
me
there
was
not
enough
formaldybrom
in
all
the
world
to
quench
their
fierce
energy
there
was
no
place
in
all
the
world
safe
for
me
from
their
visitation
no
was
powerful
enough
to
lay
the
host
of
spirits
that
haunted
me
henceforth
and
i
had
neither
time
nor
money
left
with
which
to
construct
new
gatling
tanks
it
is
little
comfort
to
me
to
know
that
one
hundred
nervous
invalids
were
completely
restored
to
health
by
means
of
the
terrific
shock
which
i
administered

the
transferred
ghost
by
frank
stockton
the
country
residence
of
john
hinckman
was
a
delightful
place
to
me
for
many
reasons
it
was
the
abode
of
a
genial
though
somewhat
impulsive
hospitality
it
had
broad
lawns
and
towering
oaks
and
elms
there
were
bosky
shades
at
several
points
and
not
far
from
the
house
there
was
a
little
rill
spanned
by
a
rustic
bridge
with
the
bark
on
there
were
fruits
and
flowers
pleasant
people
chess
billiards
rides
walks
and
fishing
these
were
great
attractions
but
none
of
them
nor
all
of
them
together
would
have
been
sufficient
to
hold
me
to
the
place
very
long
i
had
been
invited
for
the
trout
season
but
should
probably
have
finished
my
visit
early
in
the
summer
had
it
not
been
that
upon
fair
days
when
the
grass
was
dry
and
the
sun
was
not
too
hot
and
there
was
but
little
wind
there
strolled
beneath
the
lofty
elms
or
passed
lightly
through
the
bosky
shades
the
form
of
my
madeline
this
lady
was
not
in
very
truth
my
madeline
she
had
never
given
herself
to
me
nor
had
i
in
any
way
acquired
possession
of
her
but
as
i
considered
her
possession
the
only
sufficient
reason
for
the
continuance
of
my
existence
i
called
her
in
my
reveries
mine
it
may
have
been
that
i
would
not
have
been
obliged
to
confine
the
use
of
this
possessive
pronoun
to
my
reveries
had
i
confessed
the
state
of
my
feelings
to
the
lady
but
this
was
an
unusually
difficult
thing
to
do
not
only
did
i
dread
as
almost
all
lovers
dread
taking
the
step
which
would
in
an
instant
put
an
end
to
that
delightful
season
which
may
be
termed
the
period
of
love
and
which
might
at
the
same
time
terminate
all
intercourse
or
connection
with
the
object
of
my
passion
but
i
was
also
dreadfully
afraid
of
john
hinckman
this
gentleman
was
a
good
friend
of
mine
but
it
would
have
required
a
bolder
man
than
i
was
at
that
time
to
ask
him
for
the
gift
of
his
niece
who
was
the
head
of
his
household
and
according
to
his
own
frequent
statement
the
main
prop
of
his
declining
years
had
madeline
acquiesced
in
my
general
views
on
the
subject
i
might
have
felt
encouraged
to
open
the
matter
to
hinckman
but
as
i
said
before
i
had
never
asked
her
whether
or
not
she
would
be
mine
i
thought
of
these
things
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night
particularly
the
latter
i
was
lying
awake
one
night
in
the
great
bed
in
my
spacious
chamber
when
by
the
dim
light
of
the
new
moon
which
partially
filled
the
room
i
saw
john
hinckman
standing
by
a
large
chair
near
the
door
i
was
very
much
surprised
at
this
for
two
reasons
in
the
first
place
my
host
had
never
before
come
into
my
room
and
in
the
second
place
he
had
gone
from
home
that
morning
and
had
not
expected
to
return
for
several
days
it
was
for
this
reason
that
i
had
been
able
that
evening
to
sit
much
later
than
usual
with
madeline
on
the
moonlit
porch
the
figure
was
certainly
that
of
john
hinckman
in
his
ordinary
dress
but
there
was
a
vagueness
and
indistinctness
about
it
which
presently
assured
me
that
it
was
a
ghost
had
the
good
old
man
been
murdered
and
had
his
spirit
come
to
tell
me
of
the
deed
and
to
confide
to
me
the
protection
of
his
dear
my
heart
fluttered
at
what
i
was
about
to
think
but
at
this
instant
the
figure
spoke
do
you
know
he
said
with
a
countenance
that
indicated
anxiety
if
hinckman
will
return
i
thought
it
well
to
maintain
a
calm
exterior
and
i
answered
we
do
not
expect
him
i
am
glad
of
that
said
he
sinking
into
the
chair
by
which
he
stood
during
the
two
years
and
a
half
that
i
have
inhabited
this
house
that
man
has
never
before
been
away
for
a
single
night
you
ca
imagine
the
relief
it
gives
me
and
as
he
spoke
he
stretched
out
his
legs
and
leaned
back
in
the
chair
his
form
became
less
vague
and
the
colors
of
his
garments
more
distinct
and
evident
while
an
expression
of
gratified
relief
succeeded
to
the
anxiety
of
his
countenance
two
years
and
a
half
i
exclaimed
i
do
understand
you
it
is
fully
that
length
of
time
said
the
ghost
since
i
first
came
here
mine
is
not
an
ordinary
case
but
before
i
say
anything
more
about
it
let
me
ask
you
again
if
you
are
sure
hinckman
will
not
return
i
am
as
sure
of
it
as
i
can
be
of
anything
i
answered
he
left
for
bristol
two
hundred
miles
away
then
i
will
go
on
said
the
ghost
for
i
am
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
of
talking
to
someone
who
will
listen
to
me
but
if
john
hinckman
should
come
in
and
catch
me
here
i
should
be
frightened
out
of
my
wits
this
is
all
very
strange
i
said
greatly
puzzled
by
what
i
had
heard
are
you
the
ghost
of
mr
hinckman
this
was
a
bold
question
but
my
mind
was
so
full
of
other
emotions
that
there
seemed
to
be
no
room
for
that
of
fear
yes
i
am
his
ghost
my
companion
replied
and
yet
i
have
no
right
to
be
and
this
is
what
makes
me
so
uneasy
and
so
much
afraid
of
him
it
is
a
strange
story
and
i
truly
believe
without
precedent
two
years
and
a
half
ago
john
hinckman
was
dangerously
ill
in
this
very
room
at
one
time
he
was
so
far
gone
that
he
was
really
believed
to
be
dead
it
was
in
consequence
of
too
precipitate
a
report
in
regard
to
this
matter
that
i
was
at
that
time
appointed
to
be
his
ghost
imagine
my
surprise
and
horror
sir
when
after
i
had
accepted
the
position
and
assumed
its
responsibilities
that
old
man
revived
became
convalescent
and
eventually
regained
his
usual
health
my
situation
was
now
one
of
extreme
delicacy
and
embarrassment
i
had
no
power
to
return
to
my
original
unembodiment
and
i
had
no
right
to
be
the
ghost
of
a
man
who
was
not
dead
i
was
advised
by
my
friends
to
quietly
maintain
my
position
and
was
assured
that
as
john
hinckman
was
an
elderly
man
it
could
not
be
long
before
i
could
rightfully
assume
the
position
for
which
i
had
been
selected
but
i
tell
you
sir
he
continued
with
animation
the
old
fellow
seems
as
vigorous
as
ever
and
i
have
no
idea
how
much
longer
this
annoying
state
of
things
will
continue
i
spend
my
time
trying
to
get
out
of
that
old
man
way
i
must
not
leave
this
house
and
he
seems
to
follow
me
everywhere
i
tell
you
sir
he
haunts
me
that
is
truly
a
queer
state
of
things
i
remarked
but
why
are
you
afraid
of
him
he
could
hurt
you
of
course
he
could
said
the
ghost
but
his
very
presence
is
a
shock
and
terror
to
me
imagine
sir
how
you
would
feel
if
my
case
were
yours
i
could
not
imagine
such
a
thing
at
all
i
simply
shuddered
and
if
one
must
be
a
wrongful
ghost
at
all
the
apparition
continued
it
would
be
much
pleasanter
to
be
the
ghost
of
some
man
other
than
john
hinckman
there
is
in
him
an
irascibility
of
temper
accompanied
by
a
facility
of
invective
which
is
seldom
met
with
and
what
would
happen
if
he
were
to
see
me
and
find
out
as
i
am
sure
he
would
how
long
and
why
i
had
inhabited
his
house
i
can
scarcely
conceive
i
have
seen
him
in
his
bursts
of
passion
and
although
he
did
not
hurt
the
people
he
stormed
at
any
more
than
he
would
hurt
me
they
seemed
to
shrink
before
him
all
this
i
knew
to
be
very
true
had
it
not
been
for
this
peculiarity
of
hinckman
i
might
have
been
more
willing
to
talk
to
him
about
his
niece
i
feel
sorry
for
you
i
said
for
i
really
began
to
have
a
sympathetic
feeling
toward
this
unfortunate
apparition
your
case
is
indeed
a
hard
one
it
reminds
me
of
those
persons
who
have
had
doubles
and
i
suppose
a
man
would
often
be
very
angry
indeed
when
he
found
that
there
was
another
being
who
was
personating
himself
oh
the
cases
are
not
similar
at
all
said
the
ghost
a
double
or
lives
on
the
earth
with
a
man
and
being
exactly
like
him
he
makes
all
sorts
of
trouble
of
course
it
is
very
different
with
me
i
am
not
here
to
live
with
hinckman
i
am
here
to
take
his
place
now
it
would
make
john
hinckman
very
angry
if
he
knew
that
do
you
know
it
would
i
assented
promptly
now
that
he
is
away
i
can
be
easy
for
a
little
while
continued
the
ghost
and
i
am
so
glad
to
have
an
opportunity
of
talking
to
you
i
have
frequently
come
into
your
room
and
watched
you
while
you
slept
but
did
not
dare
to
speak
to
you
for
fear
that
if
you
talked
with
me
hinckman
would
hear
you
and
come
into
the
room
to
know
why
you
were
talking
to
yourself
but
would
he
not
hear
you
i
asked
oh
no
said
the
other
there
are
times
when
anyone
may
see
me
but
no
one
hears
me
except
the
person
to
whom
i
address
myself
but
why
did
you
wish
to
speak
to
me
i
asked
because
replied
the
ghost
i
like
occasionally
to
talk
to
people
and
especially
to
someone
like
yourself
whose
mind
is
so
troubled
and
perturbed
that
you
are
not
likely
to
be
frightened
by
a
visit
from
one
of
us
but
i
particularly
wanted
to
ask
you
to
do
me
a
favor
there
is
every
probability
so
far
as
i
can
see
that
john
hinckman
will
live
a
long
time
and
my
situation
is
becoming
insupportable
my
great
object
at
present
is
to
get
myself
transferred
and
i
think
that
you
may
perhaps
be
of
use
to
me
transferred
i
exclaimed
what
do
you
mean
by
that
what
i
mean
said
the
other
is
this
now
that
i
have
started
on
my
career
i
have
got
to
be
the
ghost
of
somebody
and
i
want
to
be
the
ghost
of
a
man
who
is
really
dead
i
should
think
that
would
be
easy
enough
i
said
opportunities
must
continually
occur
not
at
all
not
at
all
said
my
companion
quickly
you
have
no
idea
what
a
rush
and
pressure
there
is
for
situations
of
this
kind
whenever
a
vacancy
occurs
if
i
may
express
myself
in
that
way
there
are
crowds
of
applications
for
the
i
had
no
idea
that
such
a
state
of
things
existed
i
said
becoming
quite
interested
in
the
matter
there
ought
to
be
some
regular
system
or
order
of
precedence
by
which
you
could
all
take
your
turns
like
customers
in
a
barber
shop
oh
dear
that
would
never
do
at
all
said
the
other
some
of
us
would
have
to
wait
forever
there
is
always
a
great
rush
whenever
a
good
offers
itself
while
as
you
know
there
are
some
positions
that
no
one
would
care
for
and
it
was
in
consequence
of
my
being
in
too
great
a
hurry
on
an
occasion
of
the
kind
that
i
got
myself
into
my
present
disagreeable
predicament
and
i
have
thought
that
it
might
be
possible
that
you
would
help
me
out
of
it
you
might
know
of
a
case
where
an
opportunity
for
a
was
not
generally
expected
but
which
might
present
itself
at
any
moment
if
you
would
give
me
a
short
notice
i
know
i
could
arrange
for
a
transfer
what
do
you
mean
i
exclaimed
do
you
want
me
to
commit
suicide
or
to
undertake
a
murder
for
your
benefit
oh
no
no
no
said
the
other
with
a
vapory
smile
i
mean
nothing
of
that
kind
to
be
sure
there
are
lovers
who
are
watched
with
considerable
interest
such
persons
having
been
known
in
moments
of
depression
to
offer
very
desirable
but
i
did
not
think
of
anything
of
that
kind
in
connection
with
you
you
were
the
only
person
i
cared
to
speak
to
and
i
hoped
that
you
might
give
me
some
information
that
would
be
of
use
and
in
return
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
help
you
in
your
love
affair
you
seem
to
know
that
i
have
such
an
affair
i
said
oh
yes
replied
the
other
with
a
little
yawn
i
could
not
be
here
so
much
as
i
have
been
without
knowing
all
about
that
there
was
something
horrible
in
the
idea
of
madeline
and
myself
having
been
watched
by
a
ghost
even
perhaps
when
we
wandered
together
in
the
most
delightful
and
bosky
places
but
then
this
was
quite
an
exceptional
ghost
and
i
could
not
have
the
objections
to
him
which
would
ordinarily
arise
in
regard
to
beings
of
his
class
i
must
go
now
said
the
ghost
rising
but
i
will
see
you
somewhere
night
and
remember
you
help
me
and
i
help
you
i
had
doubts
the
next
morning
as
to
the
propriety
of
telling
madeline
anything
about
this
interview
and
soon
convinced
myself
that
i
must
keep
silent
on
the
subject
if
she
knew
there
was
a
ghost
about
the
house
she
would
probably
leave
the
place
instantly
i
did
not
mention
the
matter
and
so
regulated
my
demeanor
that
i
am
quite
sure
madeline
never
suspected
what
had
taken
place
for
some
time
i
had
wished
that
hinckman
would
absent
himself
for
a
day
at
least
from
the
premises
in
such
case
i
thought
i
might
more
easily
nerve
myself
up
to
the
point
of
speaking
to
madeline
on
the
subject
of
our
future
collateral
existence
and
now
that
the
opportunity
for
such
speech
had
really
occurred
i
did
not
feel
ready
to
avail
myself
of
it
what
would
become
of
me
if
she
refused
me
i
had
an
idea
however
that
the
lady
thought
that
if
i
were
going
to
speak
at
all
this
was
the
time
she
must
have
known
that
certain
sentiments
were
afloat
within
me
and
she
was
not
unreasonable
in
her
wish
to
see
the
matter
settled
one
way
or
the
other
but
i
did
not
feel
like
taking
a
bold
step
in
the
dark
if
she
wished
me
to
ask
her
to
give
herself
to
me
she
ought
to
offer
me
some
reason
to
suppose
that
she
would
make
the
gift
if
i
saw
no
probability
of
such
generosity
i
would
prefer
that
things
should
remain
as
they
were
that
evening
i
was
sitting
with
madeline
in
the
moonlit
porch
it
was
nearly
ten
and
ever
since
i
had
been
working
myself
up
to
the
point
of
making
an
avowal
of
my
sentiments
i
had
not
positively
determined
to
do
this
but
wished
gradually
to
reach
the
proper
point
when
if
the
prospect
looked
bright
i
might
speak
my
companion
appeared
to
understand
the
situation
at
least
i
imagined
that
the
nearer
i
came
to
a
proposal
the
more
she
seemed
to
expect
it
it
was
certainly
a
very
critical
and
important
epoch
in
my
life
if
i
spoke
i
should
make
myself
happy
or
miserable
forever
and
if
i
did
not
speak
i
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
lady
would
not
give
me
another
chance
to
do
so
sitting
thus
with
madeline
talking
a
little
and
thinking
very
hard
over
these
momentous
matters
i
looked
up
and
saw
the
ghost
not
a
dozen
feet
away
from
us
he
was
sitting
on
the
railing
of
the
porch
one
leg
thrown
up
before
him
the
other
dangling
down
as
he
leaned
against
a
post
he
was
behind
madeline
but
almost
in
front
of
me
as
i
sat
facing
the
lady
it
was
fortunate
that
madeline
was
looking
out
over
the
landscape
for
i
must
have
appeared
very
much
startled
the
ghost
had
told
me
that
he
would
see
me
some
time
this
night
but
i
did
not
think
he
would
make
his
appearance
when
i
was
in
the
company
of
madeline
if
she
should
see
the
spirit
of
her
uncle
i
could
not
answer
for
the
consequences
i
made
no
exclamation
but
the
ghost
evidently
saw
that
i
was
troubled
do
be
afraid
he
said
i
shall
not
let
her
see
me
and
she
can
not
hear
me
speak
unless
i
address
myself
to
her
which
i
do
not
intend
to
do
i
suppose
i
looked
grateful
so
you
need
not
trouble
yourself
about
that
the
ghost
continued
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
not
getting
along
very
well
with
your
affair
if
i
were
you
i
should
speak
out
without
waiting
any
longer
you
will
never
have
a
better
chance
you
are
not
likely
to
be
interrupted
and
so
far
as
i
can
judge
the
lady
seems
disposed
to
listen
to
you
favorably
that
is
if
she
ever
intends
to
do
so
there
is
no
knowing
when
john
hinckman
will
go
away
again
certainly
not
this
summer
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
should
never
dare
to
make
love
to
hinckman
niece
if
he
were
anywhere
about
the
place
if
he
should
catch
anyone
offering
himself
to
miss
madeline
he
would
then
be
a
terrible
man
to
encounter
i
agreed
perfectly
to
all
this
i
can
not
bear
to
think
of
him
i
ejaculated
aloud
think
of
whom
asked
madeline
turning
quickly
toward
me
here
was
an
awkward
situation
the
long
speech
of
the
ghost
to
which
madeline
paid
no
attention
but
which
i
heard
with
perfect
distinctness
had
made
me
forget
myself
it
was
necessary
to
explain
quickly
of
course
it
would
not
do
to
admit
that
it
was
of
her
dear
uncle
that
i
was
speaking
and
so
i
mentioned
hastily
the
first
name
i
thought
of
vilars
i
said
this
statement
was
entirely
correct
for
i
never
could
bear
to
think
of
vilars
who
was
a
gentleman
who
had
at
various
times
paid
much
attention
to
madeline
it
is
wrong
for
you
to
speak
in
that
way
of
vilars
she
said
he
is
a
remarkably
well
educated
and
sensible
young
man
and
has
very
pleasant
manners
he
expects
to
be
elected
to
the
legislature
this
fall
and
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
he
made
his
mark
he
will
do
well
in
a
legislative
body
for
whenever
vilars
has
anything
to
say
he
knows
just
how
and
when
to
say
it
this
was
spoken
very
quietly
and
without
any
show
of
resentment
which
was
all
very
natural
for
if
madeline
thought
at
all
favorably
of
me
she
could
not
feel
displeased
that
i
should
have
disagreeable
emotions
in
regard
to
a
possible
rival
the
concluding
words
contained
a
hint
which
i
was
not
slow
to
understand
i
felt
very
sure
that
if
vilars
were
in
my
present
position
he
would
speak
quickly
enough
i
know
it
is
wrong
to
have
such
ideas
about
a
person
i
said
but
i
can
not
help
it
the
lady
did
not
chide
me
and
after
this
she
seemed
even
in
a
softer
mood
as
for
me
i
felt
considerably
annoyed
for
i
had
not
wished
to
admit
that
any
thought
of
vilars
had
ever
occupied
my
mind
you
should
not
speak
aloud
that
way
said
the
ghost
or
you
may
get
yourself
into
trouble
i
want
to
see
everything
go
well
with
you
because
then
you
may
be
disposed
to
help
me
especially
if
i
should
chance
to
be
of
any
assistance
to
you
which
i
hope
i
shall
be
i
longed
to
tell
him
that
there
was
no
way
in
which
he
could
help
me
so
much
as
by
taking
his
instant
departure
to
make
love
to
a
young
lady
with
a
ghost
sitting
on
the
railing
nearby
and
that
ghost
the
apparition
of
a
uncle
the
very
idea
of
whom
in
such
a
position
and
at
such
a
time
made
me
tremble
was
a
difficult
if
not
an
impossible
thing
to
do
but
i
forbore
to
speak
although
i
may
have
looked
my
mind
i
suppose
continued
the
ghost
that
you
have
not
heard
anything
that
might
be
of
advantage
to
me
of
course
i
am
very
anxious
to
hear
but
if
you
have
anything
to
tell
me
i
can
wait
until
you
are
alone
i
will
come
to
you
in
your
room
or
i
will
stay
here
until
the
lady
goes
away
you
need
not
wait
here
i
said
i
have
nothing
at
all
to
say
to
you
madeline
sprang
to
her
feet
her
face
flushed
and
her
eyes
ablaze
wait
here
she
cried
what
do
you
suppose
i
am
waiting
for
nothing
to
say
to
me
indeed
i
should
think
so
what
should
you
have
to
say
to
me
madeline
i
exclaimed
stepping
toward
her
let
me
explain
but
she
had
gone
here
was
the
end
of
the
world
for
me
i
turned
fiercely
to
the
ghost
wretched
existence
i
cried
you
have
ruined
everything
you
have
blackened
my
whole
life
had
it
not
been
for
you
but
here
my
voice
faltered
i
could
say
no
more
you
wrong
me
said
the
ghost
i
have
not
injured
you
i
have
tried
only
to
encourage
and
assist
you
and
it
is
your
own
folly
that
has
done
this
mischief
but
do
not
despair
such
mistakes
as
these
can
be
explained
keep
up
a
brave
heart
and
he
vanished
from
the
railing
like
a
bursting
i
went
gloomily
to
bed
but
i
saw
no
apparitions
that
night
except
those
of
despair
and
misery
which
my
wretched
thoughts
called
up
the
words
i
had
uttered
had
sounded
to
madeline
like
the
basest
insult
of
course
there
was
only
one
interpretation
she
could
put
upon
them
as
to
explaining
my
ejaculations
that
was
impossible
i
thought
the
matter
over
and
over
again
as
i
lay
awake
that
night
and
i
determined
that
i
would
never
tell
madeline
the
facts
of
the
case
it
would
be
better
for
me
to
suffer
all
my
life
than
for
her
to
know
that
the
ghost
of
her
uncle
haunted
the
house
hinckman
was
away
and
if
she
knew
of
his
ghost
she
could
not
be
made
to
believe
that
he
was
not
dead
she
might
not
survive
the
shock
no
my
heart
could
bleed
but
i
would
never
tell
her
the
next
day
was
fine
neither
too
cool
nor
too
warm
the
breezes
were
gentle
and
nature
smiled
but
there
were
no
walks
or
rides
with
madeline
she
seemed
to
be
much
engaged
during
the
day
and
i
saw
but
little
of
her
when
we
met
at
meals
she
was
polite
but
very
quiet
and
reserved
she
had
evidently
determined
on
a
course
of
conduct
and
had
resolved
to
assume
that
although
i
had
been
very
rude
to
her
she
did
not
understand
the
import
of
my
words
it
would
be
quite
proper
of
course
for
her
not
to
know
what
i
meant
by
my
expressions
of
the
night
before
i
was
downcast
and
wretched
and
said
but
little
and
the
only
bright
streak
across
the
black
horizon
of
my
woe
was
the
fact
that
she
did
not
appear
to
be
happy
although
she
affected
an
air
of
unconcern
the
moonlit
porch
was
deserted
that
evening
but
wandering
about
the
house
i
found
madeline
in
the
library
alone
she
was
reading
but
i
went
in
and
sat
down
near
her
i
felt
that
although
i
could
not
do
so
fully
i
must
in
a
measure
explain
my
conduct
of
the
night
before
she
listened
quietly
to
a
somewhat
labored
apology
i
made
for
the
words
i
had
used
i
have
not
the
slightest
idea
what
you
meant
she
said
but
you
were
very
rude
i
earnestly
disclaimed
any
intention
of
rudeness
and
assured
her
with
a
warmth
of
speech
that
must
have
made
some
impression
upon
her
that
rudeness
to
her
would
be
an
action
impossible
to
me
i
said
a
great
deal
upon
the
subject
and
implored
her
to
believe
that
if
it
were
not
for
a
certain
obstacle
i
could
speak
to
her
so
plainly
that
she
would
understand
everything
she
was
silent
for
a
time
and
then
she
said
rather
more
kindly
i
thought
than
she
had
spoken
before
is
that
obstacle
in
any
way
connected
with
my
uncle
yes
i
answered
after
a
little
hesitation
it
is
in
a
measure
connected
with
him
she
made
no
answer
to
this
and
sat
looking
at
her
book
but
not
reading
from
the
expression
of
her
face
i
thought
she
was
somewhat
softened
toward
me
she
knew
her
uncle
as
well
as
i
did
and
she
may
have
been
thinking
that
if
he
were
the
obstacle
that
prevented
my
speaking
and
there
were
many
ways
in
which
he
might
be
that
obstacle
my
position
would
be
such
a
hard
one
that
it
would
excuse
some
wildness
of
speech
and
eccentricity
of
manner
i
saw
too
that
the
warmth
of
my
partial
explanations
had
had
some
effect
on
her
and
i
began
to
believe
that
it
might
be
a
good
thing
for
me
to
speak
my
mind
without
delay
no
matter
how
she
should
receive
my
proposition
my
relations
with
her
could
not
be
worse
than
they
had
been
the
previous
night
and
day
and
there
was
something
in
her
face
which
encouraged
me
to
hope
that
she
might
forget
my
foolish
exclamations
of
the
evening
before
if
i
began
to
tell
her
my
tale
of
love
i
drew
my
chair
a
little
nearer
to
her
and
as
i
did
so
the
ghost
burst
into
the
room
from
the
doorway
behind
her
i
say
burst
although
no
door
flew
open
and
he
made
no
noise
he
was
wildly
excited
and
waved
his
arms
above
his
head
the
moment
i
saw
him
my
heart
fell
within
me
with
the
entrance
of
that
impertinent
apparition
every
hope
fled
from
me
i
could
not
speak
while
he
was
in
the
room
i
must
have
turned
pale
and
i
gazed
steadfastly
at
the
ghost
almost
without
seeing
madeline
who
sat
between
us
do
you
know
he
cried
that
john
hinckman
is
coming
up
the
hill
he
will
be
here
in
fifteen
minutes
and
if
you
are
doing
anything
in
the
way
of
you
had
better
hurry
it
up
but
this
is
not
what
i
came
to
tell
you
i
have
glorious
news
at
last
i
am
transferred
not
forty
minutes
ago
a
russian
nobleman
was
murdered
by
the
nihilists
nobody
ever
thought
of
him
in
connection
with
an
immediate
my
friends
instantly
applied
for
the
situation
for
me
and
obtained
my
transfer
i
am
off
before
that
horrid
hinckman
comes
up
the
hill
the
moment
i
reach
my
new
position
i
shall
put
off
this
hated
semblance
you
ca
imagine
how
glad
i
am
to
be
at
last
the
real
ghost
of
somebody
oh
i
cried
rising
to
my
feet
and
stretching
out
my
arms
in
utter
wretchedness
i
would
to
heaven
you
were
mine
i
yours
said
madeline
raising
to
me
her
tearful
eyes
the
mummy

théophile

translated
for
this
volume

goldman
the
mummy
foot
by
théophile
gautier
i
had
sauntered
idly
into
the
shop
of
one
of
those
dealers
in
old
curiosities
as
they
say
in
that
parisian
so
absolutely
unintelligible
elsewhere
in
france
you
have
no
doubt
often
glanced
through
the
windows
of
some
of
these
shops
which
have
become
numerous
since
it
is
so
fashionable
to
buy
antique
furniture
that
the
humblest
stockbroker
feels
obliged
to
have
a
room
furnished
in
medieval
style
something
is
there
which
belongs
alike
to
the
shop
of
the
dealer
in
old
iron
the
warehouse
of
the
merchant
the
laboratory
of
the
chemist
and
the
studio
of
the
painter
in
all
these
mysterious
recesses
where
but
a
discreet
filters
through
the
shutters
the
most
obviously
antique
thing
is
the
dust
the
cobwebs
are
more
genuine
than
the
laces
and
the
old
furniture
is
more
modern
than
the
mahogany
which
arrived
but
yesterday
from
america
the
warehouse
of
my
dealer
in
was
a
veritable
capharnaüm
all
ages
and
all
countries
seemed
to
have
arranged
a
rendezvous
there
an
etruscan
terra
cotta
lamp
stood
upon
a
boule
cabinet
with
ebony
panels
decorated
with
simple
filaments
of
inlaid
copper
a
duchess
of
the
reign
of
louis
xv
stretched
nonchalantly
her
graceful
feet
under
a
massive
louis
xiii
table
with
heavy
spiral
oaken
legs
and
carvings
of
intermingled
flowers
and
grotesque
figures
in
a
corner
glittered
the
ornamented
breastplate
of
a
suit
of
damaskeened
armor
of
milan
the
shelves
and
floor
were
littered
with
porcelain
cupids
and
nymphs
chinese
monkeys
vases
of
pale
green
enamel
cups
of
dresden
and
old
sèvres
upon
the
denticulated
shelves
of
sideboards
gleamed
huge
japanese
plaques
with
red
and
blue
designs
outlined
in
gold
side
by
side
with
the
enamels
of
bernard
palissy
with
serpents
frogs
and
lizards
in
relief
from
ransacked
cabinets
tumbled
cascades
of
china
silk
the
shimmering
brocade
pricked
into
luminous
beads
by
a
slanting
sunbeam
while
portraits
of
every
epoch
smiled
through
their
yellowed
varnish
from
frames
more
or
less
tarnished
the
dealer
followed
me
watchfully
through
the
tortuous
passages
winding
between
the
piles
of
furniture
warding
off
with
his
hands
the
perilous
swing
of
my
coat
tail
observing
my
elbows
with
the
disquieting
concern
of
an
antiquarian
and
a
usurer
he
was
an
odd
figure
this
dealer
an
enormous
skull
smooth
as
a
knee
was
surrounded
by
a
scant
aureole
of
white
hair
which
by
contrast
emphasized
the
tint
of
his
complexion
and
gave
a
wrong
impression
of
patriarchal
benevolence
corrected
however
by
the
glittering
of
two
small
yellow
eyes
which
shifted
in
their
orbits
like
two
floating
on
quicksilver
the
curve
of
his
nose
gave
him
an
aquiline
silhouette
which
suggested
the
oriental
or
jewish
type
his
hands
long
slender
with
prominent
veins
and
sinews
protruding
like
the
strings
on
a
violin
with
nails
like
the
claws
on
the
membraneous
wings
of
the
bat
moved
with
a
senile
trembling
painful
to
behold
but
those
nervously
quivering
hands
became
firmer
than
pincers
of
steel
or
the
claws
of
a
lobster
when
they
picked
up
any
precious
object
an
onyx
cup
a
venetian
glass
or
a
platter
of
bohemian
crystal
this
curious
old
fellow
had
an
air
so
thoroughly
rabbinical
and
cabalistic
that
from
mere
appearance
he
would
have
been
burned
at
the
stake
three
centuries
ago
will
you
not
buy
something
from
me
sir
here
is
a
kris
from
malay
with
a
blade
which
undulates
like
a
flame
look
at
these
grooves
for
the
blood
to
drip
from
these
teeth
reversed
so
as
to
tear
out
the
entrails
in
withdrawing
the
weapon
it
is
a
fine
specimen
of
a
ferocious
weapon
and
will
be
an
interesting
addition
to
your
trophies
this
sword
is
very
beautiful
it
is
the
work
of
joseph
de
la
herz
and
this
with
its
carved
guard
what
superb
workmanship
no
i
have
enough
weapons
and
instruments
of
carnage
i
should
like
to
have
a
small
figure
any
sort
of
object
which
can
be
used
for
a
paper
weight
for
i
can
not
endure
those
commonplace
bronzes
for
sale
at
the
stationers
which
one
sees
invariably
on
everybody
desk
the
old
gnome
rummaging
among
his
ancient
wares
displayed
before
me
some
antique
bronzes
at
least
fragments
of
malachite
little
hindu
and
chinese
idols
jade
monkeys
incarnations
of
brahma
and
vishnu
marvelously
suitable
for
the
purpose
scarcely
divine
of
holding
papers
and
letters
in
place
i
was
hesitating
between
a
porcelain
dragon
covered
with
constellations
of
warts
its
jaws
embellished
with
teeth
and
tusks
and
a
hideous
little
mexican
fetish
representing
realistically
the
god
vitziliputzili
when
i
noticed
a
charming
foot
which
at
first
i
supposed
was
a
fragment
of
some
antique
venus
it
had
that
beautiful
tawny
reddish
tint
which
gives
the
florentine
bronzes
their
warm
appearance
so
preferable
to
the
verdigris
tones
of
ordinary
bronzes
which
might
be
taken
readily
for
statues
in
a
state
of
putrefaction
a
satiny
luster
gleamed
over
its
curves
polished
by
the
amorous
kisses
of
twenty
centuries
for
it
must
have
been
a
corinthian
bronze
a
work
of
the
finest
period
molded
perhaps
by
lysippus
himself
that
foot
will
do
i
said
to
the
dealer
who
looked
at
me
with
an
ironical
crafty
expression
as
he
handed
me
the
object
i
asked
for
so
that
i
might
examine
it
more
carefully
i
was
surprised
at
its
lightness
it
was
not
a
metal
foot
but
in
reality
a
foot
of
flesh
an
embalmed
foot
a
mummy
foot
on
examining
it
more
closely
one
could
distinguish
the
grain
of
the
skin
and
the
almost
imperceptible
imprint
of
the
weave
of
the
wrappings
the
toes
were
slender
delicate
with
perfect
nails
pure
and
transparent
as
agate
the
great
toe
slightly
separated
from
the
others
in
the
antique
manner
was
in
pleasing
contrast
to
the
position
of
the
other
toes
and
gave
a
suggestion
of
the
freedom
and
lightness
of
a
bird
foot
the
sole
faintly
streaked
with
almost
invisible
lines
showed
that
it
had
never
touched
the
ground
or
come
in
contact
with
anything
but
the
finest
mats
woven
from
the
rushes
of
the
nile
and
the
softest
rugs
of
panther
skin
ha
ha
you
want
the
foot
of
the
princess
hermonthis
said
the
dealer
with
a
strange
mocking
laugh
staring
at
me
with
his
owlish
eyes
ha
ha
ha
for
a
paper
weight
an
original
idea
an
artist
idea
if
anyone
had
told
old
pharaoh
that
the
foot
of
his
adored
daughter
would
be
used
for
a
paper
weight
particularly
whilst
he
was
having
a
mountain
of
granite
hollowed
out
in
which
to
place
her
triple
coffin
painted
and
gilded
covered
with
hieroglyphics
and
beautiful
pictures
of
the
judgment
of
souls
it
would
truly
have
surprised
him
continued
the
queer
little
dealer
in
low
tones
as
though
talking
to
himself
how
much
will
you
charge
me
for
this
fragment
of
a
mummy
ah
as
much
as
i
can
get
for
it
is
a
superb
piece
if
i
had
the
mate
to
it
you
could
not
have
it
for
less
than
five
hundred
francs
the
daughter
of
a
pharaoh
there
could
be
nothing
more
choice
assuredly
it
is
not
common
but
still
how
much
do
you
want
for
it
first
however
i
want
to
acquaint
you
with
one
fact
which
is
that
my
fortune
consists
of
only
five
louis
i
will
buy
anything
that
costs
five
louis
but
nothing
more
expensive
you
may
search
my
vest
pockets
and
my
most
secret
bureau
drawers
but
you
will
not
find
one
miserable
five
franc
piece
besides
five
louis
for
the
foot
of
the
princess
hermonthis
it
is
very
little
too
little
in
fact
for
an
authentic
foot
said
the
dealer
shaking
his
head
and
rolling
his
eyes
with
a
peculiar
rotary
motion
very
well
take
it
and
i
will
throw
in
the
outer
covering
he
said
rolling
it
in
a
shred
of
old
damask
very
beautiful
genuine
damask
which
has
never
been
redyed
it
is
strong
yet
it
is
soft
he
muttered
caressing
the
frayed
tissue
in
accordance
with
his
dealer
habit
of
praising
an
article
of
so
little
value
that
he
himself
thought
it
good
for
nothing
but
to
give
away
he
dropped
the
gold
pieces
into
a
kind
of
medieval
pouch
which
was
fastened
at
his
belt
while
he
repeated
the
foot
of
the
princess
hermonthis
to
be
used
for
a
paper
weight
then
fastening
upon
me
his
phosphorescent
pupils
he
said
in
a
voice
strident
as
the
wails
of
a
cat
which
has
just
swallowed
a
fish
bone
old
pharaoh
will
not
be
pleased
he
loved
his
daughter
that
dear
man
you
speak
of
him
as
though
you
were
his
contemporary
no
matter
how
old
you
may
be
you
do
not
date
back
to
the
pyramids
of
egypt
i
answered
laughingly
from
the
threshold
of
the
shop
i
returned
home
delighted
with
my
purchase
to
make
use
of
it
at
once
i
placed
the
foot
of
the
exalted
princess
hermonthis
on
a
stack
of
papers
sketches
of
verses
undecipherable
mosaics
of
crossed
out
words
unfinished
articles
forgotten
letters
posted
in
the
desk
drawer
a
mistake
often
made
by
people
the
effect
was
pleasing
bizarre
and
romantic
highly
delighted
with
this
decoration
i
went
down
into
the
street
and
took
a
walk
with
all
the
importance
and
pride
proper
to
a
man
who
has
the
inexpressible
advantage
over
the
passersby
he
elbows
of
possessing
a
fragment
of
the
princess
hermonthis
daughter
of
pharaoh
i
thought
people
who
did
not
possess
like
myself
a
paper
weight
so
genuinely
egyptian
were
objects
of
ridicule
and
it
seemed
to
me
the
proper
business
of
the
sensible
man
to
have
a
mummy
foot
upon
his
desk
happily
an
encounter
with
several
friends
distracted
me
from
my
raptures
over
my
recent
acquisition
i
went
to
dinner
with
them
for
it
would
have
been
hard
for
me
to
dine
alone
when
i
returned
at
night
with
my
brain
somewhat
muddled
by
the
effects
of
a
few
glasses
of
wine
a
vague
whiff
of
oriental
perfume
tickled
delicately
my
olfactory
nerves
the
heat
of
the
room
had
warmed
the
natron
the
bitumen
and
the
myrrh
in
which
the
who
embalmed
the
dead
had
bathed
the
body
of
the
princess
it
was
a
delicate
yet
penetrating
perfume
which
four
thousand
years
had
not
been
able
to
dissipate
the
dream
of
egypt
was
for
the
eternal
its
odors
have
the
solidity
of
granite
and
last
as
long
in
a
short
time
i
drank
full
draughts
from
the
black
cup
of
sleep
for
an
hour
or
two
all
remained
in
obscurity
oblivion
and
nothingness
submerged
me
in
their
somber
waves
nevertheless
the
haziness
of
my
perceptions
gradually
cleared
away
dreams
began
to
brush
me
lightly
in
their
silent
flight
the
eyes
of
my
soul
opened
and
i
saw
my
room
as
it
was
in
reality
i
might
have
believed
myself
awake
if
i
had
not
had
a
vague
consciousness
that
i
was
asleep
and
that
something
very
unusual
was
about
to
take
place
the
odor
of
myrrh
had
increased
in
intensity
and
i
had
a
slight
headache
which
i
very
naturally
attributed
to
several
glasses
of
champagne
that
we
had
drunk
to
unknown
gods
and
to
our
future
success
i
scrutinized
my
room
with
a
feeling
of
expectation
which
there
was
nothing
to
justify
each
piece
of
furniture
was
in
its
usual
place
the
lamp
softly
shaded
by
the
milky
whiteness
of
its
ground
crystal
globe
burned
upon
the
console
the
water
colors
glowed
from
under
the
bohemian
glass
the
curtains
hung
in
heavy
drooping
folds
everything
suggested
tranquility
and
slumber
nevertheless
after
a
few
moments
the
quiet
of
the
room
was
disturbed
the
woodwork
creaked
furtively
the
log
suddenly
spurted
out
a
blue
flame
and
the
surfaces
of
the
plaques
seemed
like
metallic
eyes
watching
like
myself
for
what
was
about
to
happen
by
chance
my
eyes
fell
on
the
table
on
which
i
had
placed
the
foot
of
the
princess
hermonthis
instead
of
remaining
in
the
state
of
immobility
proper
to
a
foot
which
has
been
embalmed
for
four
thousand
years
it
moved
about
in
an
agitated
manner
twitching
leaping
about
over
the
papers
like
a
frightened
frog
one
might
have
thought
it
in
contact
with
a
galvanic
battery
i
could
hear
distinctly
the
quick
tap
of
the
little
heel
hard
as
the
hoof
of
a
gazelle
i
became
rather
dissatisfied
with
my
purchase
for
i
like
paper
weights
of
sedentary
habits
besides
i
found
it
very
unnatural
for
feet
to
move
about
without
legs
and
i
began
to
feel
something
closely
resembling
fear
suddenly
i
noticed
a
movement
of
one
of
the
folds
of
my
curtains
and
i
heard
a
stamping
like
that
made
by
a
person
hopping
about
on
one
foot
i
must
admit
that
i
grew
hot
and
cold
by
turns
that
i
felt
a
mysterious
breeze
blowing
down
my
back
and
that
my
hair
stood
on
end
so
suddenly
that
it
forced
my
to
a
leap
of
several
degrees
the
curtains
partly
opened
and
i
saw
the
strangest
figure
possible
advancing
it
was
a
young
girl
as
as
amani
the
dancer
and
of
a
perfect
beauty
of
the
purest
egyptian
type
she
had
slanting
eyes
with
eyebrows
so
black
that
they
appeared
blue
her
nose
was
finely
chiseled
almost
grecian
in
its
delicacy
she
might
have
been
taken
for
a
corinthian
statue
of
bronze
had
not
her
prominent
cheekbones
and
rather
african
fullness
of
lips
indicated
without
a
doubt
the
hieroglyphic
race
which
dwelt
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
her
arms
thin
spindle
shaped
like
those
of
very
young
girls
were
encircled
with
a
kind
of
metal
ornament
and
bracelets
of
glass
beads
her
hair
was
twisted
into
little
cords
on
her
breast
hung
a
green
paste
idol
identified
by
her
whip
of
seven
lashes
as
isis
guide
of
souls
a
golden
ornament
shone
on
her
forehead
and
slight
traces
of
rouge
were
visible
on
the
coppery
tints
of
her
cheeks
as
for
her
costume
it
was
very
odd
imagine
a
made
of
narrow
strips
bedizened
with
red
and
black
hieroglyphics
weighted
with
bitumen
and
apparently
belonging
to
a
mummy
newly
unswathed
in
one
of
those
flights
of
fancy
usual
in
dreams
i
could
hear
the
hoarse
rough
voice
of
the
dealer
of
reciting
in
a
monotonous
refrain
the
phrase
he
had
kept
repeating
in
his
shop
in
so
enigmatic
a
manner
old
pharaoh
will
not
be
pleased
he
loved
his
daughter
very
much
that
dear
man
one
peculiar
detail
which
was
hardly
reassuring
was
that
the
apparition
had
but
one
foot
the
other
was
broken
off
at
the
ankle
she
approached
the
table
where
the
mummy
foot
was
fidgeting
and
tossing
about
with
redoubled
energy
she
leaned
against
the
edge
and
i
saw
her
eyes
fill
with
pearly
tears
although
she
did
not
speak
i
fully
understood
her
feelings
she
looked
at
the
foot
for
it
was
in
truth
her
own
with
an
expression
of
coquettish
sadness
which
was
extremely
charming
but
the
foot
kept
jumping
and
running
about
as
though
it
were
moved
by
springs
of
steel
two
or
three
times
she
stretched
out
her
hand
to
grasp
it
but
did
not
succeed
then
began
between
the
princess
hermonthis
and
her
foot
which
seemed
to
be
endowed
with
an
individuality
of
its
own
a
very
bizarre
dialogue
in
an
ancient
coptic
tongue
such
as
might
have
been
spoken
thirty
centuries
before
among
the
sphinxes
of
the
land
of
ser
fortunately
that
night
i
understood
coptic
perfectly
the
princess
hermonthis
said
in
a
tone
of
voice
sweet
and
tremulous
as
the
tones
of
a
crystal
bell
well
my
dear
little
foot
you
always
flee
from
me
yet
i
took
the
best
of
care
of
you
i
bathed
you
with
perfumed
water
in
a
basin
of
alabaster
i
rubbed
your
heel
with
pumice
stone
mixed
with
oil
of
palm
your
nails
were
cut
with
golden
scissors
and
polished
with
a
hippopotamus
tooth
i
was
careful
to
select
for
you
painted
and
embroidered
with
turned
up
toes
which
were
the
envy
of
all
the
young
girls
of
egypt
on
your
great
toe
you
wore
rings
representing
the
sacred
scarab
and
you
supported
one
of
the
lightest
bodies
that
could
be
desired
by
a
lazy
foot
the
foot
answered
in
a
pouting
regretful
voice
you
know
well
that
i
no
longer
belong
to
myself
i
have
been
bought
and
paid
for
the
old
dealer
knew
what
he
was
about
he
bears
you
a
grudge
for
having
refused
to
marry
him
this
is
a
trick
he
has
played
on
you
the
arab
who
forced
open
your
royal
tomb
in
the
subterranean
pits
of
the
necropolis
of
thebes
was
sent
there
by
him
he
wanted
to
prevent
you
from
attending
the
reunion
of
the
shades
in
the
cities
of
the
lower
world
have
you
five
pieces
of
gold
with
which
to
ransom
me
alas
no
my
jewels
my
rings
my
purses
of
gold
and
of
silver
have
all
been
stolen
from
me
answered
the
princess
hermonthis
with
a
sigh
princess
i
then
cried
out
i
have
never
kept
possession
of
foot
unjustly
even
though
you
have
not
the
five
louis
which
it
cost
me
i
will
return
it
to
you
gladly
i
should
be
wretched
were
i
the
cause
of
the
lameness
of
so
charming
a
person
as
the
princess
hermonthis
i
delivered
this
discourse
in
a
courtly
manner
which
must
have
astonished
the
beautiful
egyptian
she
looked
at
me
with
an
expression
of
deepest
gratitude
and
her
eyes
brightened
with
bluish
lights
she
took
her
foot
which
this
time
submitted
and
like
a
woman
about
to
put
on
her
brodekin
she
adjusted
it
to
her
leg
with
great
dexterity
this
operation
finished
she
took
a
few
steps
about
the
room
as
though
to
assure
herself
that
she
was
in
reality
no
longer
lame
ah
how
happy
my
father
will
be
he
who
was
so
wretched
because
of
my
mutilation
he
who
from
the
day
of
my
birth
set
a
whole
nation
to
work
to
hollow
out
a
tomb
so
deep
that
he
might
preserve
me
intact
until
that
supreme
last
day
when
souls
must
be
weighed
in
the
scales
of
amenti
come
with
me
to
my
father
he
will
be
happy
to
receive
you
for
you
have
given
me
back
my
foot
i
found
this
proposition
quite
natural
i
decked
myself
out
in
a
of
huge
sprawling
design
which
gave
me
an
extremely
pharaohesque
appearance
i
hurriedly
put
on
a
pair
of
turkish
slippers
and
told
the
princess
hermonthis
that
i
was
ready
to
follow
her
before
setting
out
hermonthis
detached
from
her
necklace
the
little
green
paste
image
and
placed
it
on
the
scattered
papers
which
strewed
the
table
it
is
no
more
than
right
she
said
smilingly
that
i
should
replace
your
paper
weight
she
gave
me
her
hand
which
was
soft
and
cool
as
the
skin
of
a
serpent
and
we
departed
for
a
time
we
sped
with
the
rapidity
of
an
arrow
through
a
misty
expanse
of
space
in
which
almost
indistinguishable
silhouettes
flashed
by
us
on
the
right
and
left
for
an
instant
we
saw
nothing
but
sea
and
sky
a
few
minutes
later
towering
obelisks
pillars
the
sloping
outlines
of
the
sphinx
were
designed
against
the
horizon
we
had
arrived
the
princess
conducted
me
to
the
side
of
a
mountain
of
red
granite
in
which
there
was
an
aperture
so
low
and
narrow
that
had
it
not
been
marked
by
two
monoliths
covered
with
bizarre
carvings
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
distinguish
from
the
fissures
in
the
rock
hermonthis
lighted
a
torch
and
led
the
way
the
corridors
were
hewn
through
the
living
rock
the
walls
with
panels
covered
with
hieroglyphics
and
representations
of
allegorical
processions
must
have
been
the
work
of
thousands
of
hands
for
thousands
of
years
the
corridors
of
an
interminable
length
ended
in
square
rooms
in
the
middle
of
which
pits
had
been
constructed
to
which
we
descended
by
means
of
or
spiral
staircases
these
pits
led
us
into
other
rooms
from
which
opened
out
other
corridors
embellished
in
the
same
bizarre
manner
with
serpents
coiled
in
circles
the
symbolic
tau
pedum
and
baris
prodigious
works
which
no
living
eye
should
ever
see
interminable
legends
in
granite
which
only
the
dead
throughout
eternity
have
time
to
read
at
last
we
reached
a
hall
so
vast
so
boundless
so
immeasurable
that
its
limits
could
not
be
discerned
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
extended
files
of
gigantic
columns
between
which
sparkled
livid
stars
of
yellow
light
these
glittering
points
of
light
revealed
incalculable
depths
beyond
the
princess
hermonthis
still
holding
my
hand
greeted
graciously
the
mummies
of
her
acquaintance
my
eyes
gradually
became
accustomed
to
the
shadowy
twilight
and
i
began
to
distinguish
the
objects
around
me
i
saw
seated
upon
their
thrones
the
kings
of
the
subterranean
races
they
were
dignified
old
personages
or
dried
up
shriveled
parchment
and
blackened
with
naphtha
and
bitumen
on
their
heads
they
wore
pschents
of
gold
and
their
breastplates
and
gorgets
scintillated
with
precious
stones
their
eyes
had
the
fixedness
of
the
sphinx
and
their
long
beards
were
whitened
by
the
snows
of
centuries
behind
them
stood
their
embalmed
subjects
in
the
rigid
and
constrained
postures
of
egyptian
art
preserving
eternally
the
attitudes
prescribed
by
the
hieratic
code
behind
the
subjects
the
cats
ibixes
and
crocodiles
contemporary
with
them
rendered
still
more
monstrous
by
their
wrappings
mewed
beat
their
wings
and
opened
and
closed
their
huge
jaws
in
foolish
grimaces
all
the
pharaohs
were
there
cheops
chephrenes
psammetichus
sesostri
amenoteph
all
the
rulers
of
the
country
of
the
pyramids
and
the
royal
sepulchers
on
a
still
higher
platform
sat
enthroned
the
kings
chronos
and
xixouthros
who
were
contemporary
with
the
deluge
and
who
preceded
it
the
beard
of
king
xixouthros
had
grown
to
such
lengths
that
it
had
already
wound
itself
seven
times
around
the
granite
table
against
which
he
leaned
lost
in
reverie
as
though
in
slumber
further
in
the
distance
through
a
dim
exhalation
across
the
mists
of
eternities
i
beheld
vaguely
the
kings
with
their
peoples
vanished
forever
the
princess
hermonthis
after
allowing
me
a
few
moments
to
enjoy
this
dizzying
spectacle
presented
me
to
pharaoh
her
father
who
nodded
to
me
in
a
most
majestic
manner
i
have
found
my
foot
i
have
found
my
foot
cried
the
princess
clapping
her
little
hands
with
every
indication
of
uncontrollable
joy
it
was
this
gentleman
who
returned
it
to
me
the
races
of
kheme
the
races
of
nahasi
all
the
races
black
bronze
and
repeated
in
a
chorus
the
princess
hermonthis
has
found
her
foot
xixouthros
himself
was
deeply
affected
he
raised
his
heavy
eyelids
stroked
his
moustache
and
regarded
me
with
his
glance
charged
with
the
centuries
by
oms
the
dog
of
hell
and
by
tmei
daughter
of
the
sun
and
of
truth
here
is
a
brave
and
worthy
young
man
said
pharaoh
extending
toward
me
his
scepter
which
terminated
in
a
lotus
flower
what
recompense
do
you
desire
eagerly
with
that
audacity
which
one
has
in
dreams
where
nothing
seems
impossible
i
asked
him
for
the
hand
of
the
princess
hermonthis
her
hand
in
exchange
for
her
foot
seemed
to
me
an
antithetical
recompense
in
sufficiently
good
taste
pharaoh
opened
wide
his
eyes
of
glass
surprised
at
my
pleasantry
as
well
as
my
request
from
what
country
are
you
and
what
is
your
age
i
am
a
frenchman
and
i
am
years
old
venerable
pharaoh
years
old
and
he
wishes
to
espouse
the
princess
hermonthis
who
is
thirty
centuries
old
exclaimed
in
a
chorus
all
the
thrones
and
all
the
circles
of
nations
hermonthis
alone
did
not
seem
to
think
my
request
improper
if
you
were
even
two
thousand
years
old
continued
the
old
king
i
would
gladly
bestow
upon
you
the
princess
but
the
disproportion
is
too
great
besides
our
daughters
must
have
husbands
who
will
last
and
you
no
longer
know
how
to
preserve
yourselves
of
the
last
persons
who
were
brought
here
scarcely
fifteen
centuries
ago
nothing
now
remains
but
a
pinch
of
ashes
look
my
flesh
is
as
hard
as
basalt
my
bones
are
bars
of
steel
i
shall
be
present
on
the
last
day
with
the
body
and
features
i
had
in
life
my
daughter
hermonthis
will
last
longer
than
a
statue
of
bronze
but
at
that
time
the
winds
will
have
dissipated
the
last
grains
of
your
dust
and
isis
herself
who
knew
how
to
recover
the
fragments
of
osiris
would
hardly
be
able
to
recompose
your
being
see
how
vigorous
i
still
am
and
how
powerful
is
the
strength
of
my
arm
said
he
shaking
my
hand
in
the
english
fashion
in
a
way
that
cut
my
fingers
with
my
rings
his
grasp
was
so
strong
that
i
awoke
and
discovered
my
friend
alfred
who
was
pulling
me
by
the
arm
and
shaking
me
to
make
me
get
up
oh
see
here
you
maddening
sleeper
must
i
have
you
dragged
into
the
middle
of
the
street
and
have
fireworks
put
off
close
to
your
ear
in
order
to
waken
you
it
is
afternoon
do
you
remember
that
you
promised
to
call
for
me
and
take
me
to
see
the
spanish
pictures
of
m
aguada
good
heavens
i
forgot
all
about
it
i
answered
dressing
hurriedly
we
can
go
there
at
once
i
have
the
permit
here
on
my
table
i
crossed
over
to
get
it
imagine
my
astonishment
when
i
saw
not
the
mummy
foot
i
had
bought
the
evening
before
but
the
little
green
paste
image
left
in
its
place
by
the

the
good
ship
sped
on
her
way
across
the
calm
atlantic
it
was
an
outward
passage
according
to
the
little
charts
which
the
company
had
charily
distributed
but
most
of
the
passengers
were
homeward
bound
after
a
summer
of
rest
and
recreation
and
they
were
counting
the
days
before
they
might
hope
to
see
fire
island
light
on
the
lee
side
of
the
boat
comfortably
sheltered
from
the
wind
and
just
by
the
door
of
the
captain
room
which
was
theirs
during
the
day
sat
a
little
group
of
returning
americans
the
duchess
she
was
down
on
the
purser
list
as
martin
but
her
friends
and
familiars
called
her
the
duchess
of
washington
square
and
baby
van
rensselaer
she
was
quite
old
enough
to
vote
had
her
sex
been
entitled
to
that
duty
but
as
the
younger
of
two
sisters
she
was
still
the
baby
of
the
family
the
duchess
and
baby
van
rensselaer
were
discussing
the
pleasant
english
voice
and
the
not
unpleasant
english
accent
of
a
manly
young
lordling
who
was
going
to
america
for
sport
uncle
larry
and
dear
jones
were
enticing
each
other
into
a
bet
on
the
ship
run
of
the
morrow
i
give
you
two
to
one
she
do
make
said
dear
jones
i
take
it
answered
uncle
larry
we
made
the
fifth
day
last
year
it
was
uncle
larry
seventeenth
visit
to
europe
and
this
was
therefore
his
voyage
and
when
did
you
get
in
asked
baby
van
rensselaer
i
do
care
a
bit
about
the
run
so
long
as
we
get
in
soon
we
crossed
the
bar
sunday
night
just
seven
days
after
we
left
queenstown
and
we
dropped
anchor
off
quarantine
at
three
on
monday
morning
i
hope
we
do
that
this
time
i
ca
seem
to
sleep
any
when
the
boat
stops
i
can
but
i
did
continued
uncle
larry
because
my
stateroom
was
the
most
in
the
boat
and
the
that
let
down
the
anchor
was
right
over
my
head
so
you
got
up
and
saw
the
sun
rise
over
the
bay
said
dear
jones
with
the
electric
lights
of
the
city
twinkling
in
the
distance
and
the
first
faint
flush
of
the
dawn
in
the
east
just
over
fort
lafayette
and
the
rosy
tinge
which
spread
softly
upward
and
did
you
both
come
back
together
asked
the
duchess
because
he
has
crossed
times
you
must
not
suppose
he
has
a
monopoly
in
sunrises
retorted
dear
jones
no
this
was
my
own
sunrise
and
a
mighty
pretty
one
it
was
too
i
not
matching
sunrises
with
you
remarked
uncle
larry
calmly
but
i
willing
to
back
a
merry
jest
called
forth
by
my
sunrise
against
any
two
merry
jests
called
forth
by
yours
i
confess
reluctantly
that
my
sunrise
evoked
no
merry
jest
at
all
dear
jones
was
an
honest
man
and
would
scorn
to
invent
a
merry
jest
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
that
where
my
sunrise
has
the
call
said
uncle
larry
complacently
what
was
the
merry
jest
was
baby
van
rensselaer
inquiry
the
natural
result
of
a
feminine
curiosity
thus
artistically
excited
well
here
it
is
i
was
standing
aft
near
a
patriotic
american
and
a
wandering
irishman
and
the
patriotic
american
rashly
declared
that
you
could
see
a
sunrise
like
that
anywhere
in
europe
and
this
gave
the
irishman
his
chance
and
he
said
ye
do
have
here
till
through
with
over
there
it
is
true
said
dear
jones
thoughtfully
that
they
do
have
some
things
over
there
better
than
we
do
for
instance
umbrellas
and
gowns
added
the
duchess
and
antiquities
this
was
uncle
larry
contribution
and
we
do
have
some
things
so
much
better
in
america
protested
baby
van
rensselaer
as
yet
uncorrupted
by
any
worship
of
the
effete
monarchies
of
despotic
europe
we
make
lots
of
things
a
great
deal
nicer
than
you
can
get
them
in
europe
especially
and
pretty
girls
added
dear
jones
but
he
did
not
look
at
her
and
spooks
remarked
uncle
larry
casually
spooks
queried
the
duchess
spooks
i
maintain
the
word
ghost
if
you
like
that
better
or
specters
we
turn
out
the
best
quality
of
spook
you
forget
the
lovely
ghost
stories
about
the
rhine
and
the
black
forest
interrupted
miss
van
rensselaer
with
feminine
inconsistency
i
remember
the
rhine
and
the
black
forest
and
all
the
other
haunts
of
elves
and
fairies
and
hobgoblins
but
for
good
honest
spooks
there
is
no
place
like
home
and
what
differentiates
our
spook
from
the
ordinary
ghost
of
literature
is
that
it
responds
to
the
american
sense
of
humor
take
irving
stories
for
example
the
horseman
that
a
comic
ghost
story
and
rip
van
winkle
consider
what
humor
and
what
good
humor
there
is
in
the
telling
of
his
meeting
with
the
goblin
crew
of
hendrik
hudson
men
a
still
better
example
of
this
american
way
of
dealing
with
legend
and
mystery
is
the
marvelous
tale
of
the
rival
ghosts
the
rival
ghosts
queried
the
duchess
and
baby
van
rensselaer
together
who
were
they
did
i
ever
tell
you
about
them
answered
uncle
larry
a
gleam
of
approaching
joy
flashing
from
his
eye
since
he
is
bound
to
tell
us
sooner
or
later
we
better
be
resigned
and
hear
it
now
said
dear
jones
if
you
are
not
more
eager
i
wo
tell
it
at
all
oh
do
uncle
larry
you
know
i
just
dote
on
ghost
stories
pleaded
baby
van
rensselaer
once
upon
a
time
began
uncle
larry
in
fact
a
very
few
years
ago
there
lived
in
the
thriving
town
of
new
york
a
young
american
called
duncan
eliphalet
duncan
like
his
name
he
was
half
yankee
and
half
scotch
and
naturally
he
was
a
lawyer
and
had
come
to
new
york
to
make
his
way
his
father
was
a
scotchman
who
had
come
over
and
settled
in
boston
and
married
a
salem
girl
when
eliphalet
duncan
was
about
twenty
he
lost
both
of
his
parents
his
father
left
him
enough
money
to
give
him
a
start
and
a
strong
feeling
of
pride
in
his
scotch
birth
you
see
there
was
a
title
in
the
family
in
scotland
and
although
eliphalet
father
was
the
younger
son
of
a
younger
son
yet
he
always
remembered
and
always
bade
his
only
son
to
remember
that
this
ancestry
was
noble
his
mother
left
him
her
full
share
of
yankee
grit
and
a
little
old
house
in
salem
which
had
belonged
to
her
family
for
more
than
two
hundred
years
she
was
a
hitchcock
and
the
hitchcocks
had
been
settled
in
salem
since
the
year
it
was
a
of
eliphalet
hitchcock
who
was
foremost
in
the
time
of
the
salem
witchcraft
craze
and
this
little
old
house
which
she
left
to
my
friend
eliphalet
duncan
was
haunted
by
the
ghost
of
one
of
the
witches
of
course
interrupted
dear
jones
now
how
could
it
be
the
ghost
of
a
witch
since
the
witches
were
all
burned
at
the
stake
you
never
heard
of
anybody
who
was
burned
having
a
ghost
did
you
asked
uncle
larry
that
an
argument
in
favor
of
cremation
at
any
rate
replied
dear
jones
evading
the
direct
question
it
is
if
you
do
like
ghosts
i
do
said
baby
van
rensselaer
and
so
do
i
added
uncle
larry
i
love
a
ghost
as
dearly
as
an
englishman
loves
a
lord
go
on
with
your
story
said
the
duchess
majestically
overruling
all
extraneous
discussion
this
little
old
house
at
salem
was
haunted
resumed
uncle
larry
and
by
a
very
distinguished
ghost
or
at
least
by
a
ghost
with
very
remarkable
attributes
what
was
he
like
asked
baby
van
rensselaer
with
a
premonitory
shiver
of
anticipatory
delight
it
had
a
lot
of
peculiarities
in
the
first
place
it
never
appeared
to
the
master
of
the
house
mostly
it
confined
its
visitations
to
unwelcome
guests
in
the
course
of
the
last
hundred
years
it
had
frightened
away
four
successive
while
never
intruding
on
the
head
of
the
household
i
guess
that
ghost
had
been
one
of
the
boys
when
he
was
alive
and
in
the
flesh
this
was
dear
jones
contribution
to
the
telling
of
the
tale
in
the
second
place
continued
uncle
larry
it
never
frightened
anybody
the
first
time
it
appeared
only
on
the
second
visit
were
the
scared
but
then
they
were
scared
enough
for
twice
and
they
rarely
mustered
up
courage
enough
to
risk
a
third
interview
one
of
the
most
curious
characteristics
of
this
spook
was
that
it
had
no
face
or
at
least
that
nobody
ever
saw
its
face
perhaps
he
kept
his
countenance
veiled
queried
the
duchess
who
was
beginning
to
remember
that
she
never
did
like
ghost
stories
that
was
what
i
was
never
able
to
find
out
i
have
asked
several
people
who
saw
the
ghost
and
none
of
them
could
tell
me
anything
about
its
face
and
yet
while
in
its
presence
they
never
noticed
its
features
and
never
remarked
on
their
absence
or
concealment
it
was
only
afterwards
when
they
tried
to
recall
calmly
all
the
circumstances
of
meeting
with
the
mysterious
stranger
that
they
became
aware
that
they
had
not
seen
its
face
and
they
could
not
say
whether
the
features
were
covered
or
whether
they
were
wanting
or
what
the
trouble
was
they
knew
only
that
the
face
was
never
seen
and
no
matter
how
often
they
might
see
it
they
never
fathomed
this
mystery
to
this
day
nobody
knows
whether
the
ghost
which
used
to
haunt
the
little
old
house
in
salem
had
a
face
or
what
manner
of
face
it
had
how
awfully
weird
said
baby
van
rensselaer
and
why
did
the
ghost
go
away
i
have
said
it
went
away
answered
uncle
larry
with
much
dignity
but
you
said
it
to
haunt
the
little
old
house
at
salem
so
i
supposed
it
had
moved
did
it
the
young
lady
asked
you
shall
be
told
in
due
time
eliphalet
duncan
used
to
spend
most
of
his
summer
vacations
at
salem
and
the
ghost
never
bothered
him
at
all
for
he
was
the
master
of
the
house
much
to
his
disgust
too
because
he
wanted
to
see
for
himself
the
mysterious
tenant
at
will
of
his
property
but
he
never
saw
it
never
he
arranged
with
friends
to
call
him
whenever
it
might
appear
and
he
slept
in
the
next
room
with
the
door
open
and
yet
when
their
frightened
cries
waked
him
the
ghost
was
gone
and
his
only
reward
was
to
hear
reproachful
sighs
as
soon
as
he
went
back
to
bed
you
see
the
ghost
thought
it
was
not
fair
of
eliphalet
to
seek
an
introduction
which
was
plainly
unwelcome
dear
jones
interrupted
the
by
getting
up
and
tucking
a
heavy
rug
more
snugly
around
baby
van
rensselaer
feet
for
the
sky
was
now
overcast
and
gray
and
the
air
was
damp
and
penetrating
one
fine
spring
morning
pursued
uncle
larry
eliphalet
duncan
received
great
news
i
told
you
that
there
was
a
title
in
the
family
in
scotland
and
that
eliphalet
father
was
the
younger
son
of
a
younger
son
well
it
happened
that
all
eliphalet
father
brothers
and
uncles
had
died
off
without
male
issue
except
the
eldest
son
of
the
eldest
son
and
he
of
course
bore
the
title
and
was
baron
duncan
of
duncan
now
the
great
news
that
eliphalet
duncan
received
in
new
york
one
fine
spring
morning
was
that
baron
duncan
and
his
only
son
had
been
yachting
in
the
hebrides
and
they
had
been
caught
in
a
black
squall
and
they
were
both
dead
so
my
friend
eliphalet
duncan
inherited
the
title
and
the
estates
how
romantic
said
the
duchess
so
he
was
a
baron
well
answered
uncle
larry
he
was
a
baron
if
he
chose
but
he
choose
more
fool
he
said
dear
jones
sententiously
well
answered
uncle
larry
i
not
so
sure
of
that
you
see
eliphalet
duncan
was
half
scotch
and
half
yankee
and
he
had
two
eyes
to
the
main
chance
he
held
his
tongue
about
his
windfall
of
luck
until
he
could
find
out
whether
the
scotch
estates
were
enough
to
keep
up
the
scotch
title
he
soon
discovered
that
they
were
not
and
that
the
late
lord
duncan
having
married
money
kept
up
such
state
as
he
could
out
of
the
revenues
of
the
dowry
of
lady
duncan
and
eliphalet
he
decided
that
he
would
rather
be
a
lawyer
in
new
york
living
comfortably
on
his
practice
than
a
starving
lord
in
scotland
living
scantily
on
his
title
but
he
kept
his
title
asked
the
duchess
well
answered
uncle
larry
he
kept
it
quiet
i
knew
it
and
a
friend
or
two
more
but
eliphalet
was
a
sight
too
smart
to
put
duncan
of
duncan
attorney
and
counselor
at
law
on
his
shingle
what
has
all
this
got
to
do
with
your
ghost
asked
dear
jones
pertinently
nothing
with
that
ghost
but
a
good
deal
with
another
ghost
eliphalet
was
very
learned
in
spirit
lore
perhaps
because
he
owned
the
haunted
house
at
salem
perhaps
because
he
was
a
scotchman
by
descent
at
all
events
he
had
made
a
special
study
of
the
wraiths
and
white
ladies
and
banshees
and
bogies
of
all
kinds
whose
sayings
and
doings
and
warnings
are
recorded
in
the
annals
of
the
scottish
nobility
in
fact
he
was
acquainted
with
the
habits
of
every
reputable
spook
in
the
scotch
peerage
and
he
knew
that
there
was
a
duncan
ghost
attached
to
the
person
of
the
holder
of
the
title
of
baron
duncan
of
duncan
so
besides
being
the
owner
of
a
haunted
house
in
salem
he
was
also
a
haunted
man
in
scotland
asked
baby
van
rensselaer
just
so
but
the
scotch
ghost
was
not
unpleasant
like
the
salem
ghost
although
it
had
one
peculiarity
in
common
with
its
transatlantic
it
never
appeared
to
the
holder
of
the
title
just
as
the
other
never
was
visible
to
the
owner
of
the
house
in
fact
the
duncan
ghost
was
never
seen
at
all
it
was
a
guardian
angel
only
its
sole
duty
was
to
be
in
personal
attendance
on
baron
duncan
of
duncan
and
to
warn
him
of
impending
evil
the
traditions
of
the
house
told
that
the
barons
of
duncan
had
again
and
again
felt
a
premonition
of
ill
fortune
some
of
them
had
yielded
and
withdrawn
from
the
venture
they
had
undertaken
and
it
had
failed
dismally
some
had
been
obstinate
and
had
hardened
their
hearts
and
had
gone
on
reckless
to
defeat
and
to
death
in
no
case
had
a
lord
duncan
been
exposed
to
peril
without
fair
warning
then
how
came
it
that
the
father
and
son
were
lost
in
the
yacht
off
the
hebrides
asked
dear
jones
because
they
were
too
enlightened
to
yield
to
superstition
there
is
extant
now
a
letter
of
lord
duncan
written
to
his
wife
a
few
minutes
before
he
and
his
son
set
sail
in
which
he
tells
her
how
hard
he
has
had
to
struggle
with
an
almost
overmastering
desire
to
give
up
the
trip
had
he
obeyed
the
friendly
warning
of
the
family
ghost
the
letter
would
have
been
spared
a
journey
across
the
atlantic
did
the
ghost
leave
scotland
for
america
as
soon
as
the
old
baron
died
asked
baby
van
rensselaer
with
much
interest
how
did
he
come
over
queried
dear
jones
in
the
steerage
or
as
a
cabin
passenger
i
do
know
answered
uncle
larry
calmly
and
eliphalet
know
for
as
he
was
in
no
danger
and
stood
in
no
need
of
warning
he
could
tell
whether
the
ghost
was
on
duty
or
not
of
course
he
was
on
the
watch
for
it
all
the
time
but
he
never
got
any
proof
of
its
presence
until
he
went
down
to
the
little
old
house
of
salem
just
before
the
fourth
of
july
he
took
a
friend
down
with
him
a
young
fellow
who
had
been
in
the
regular
army
since
the
day
fort
sumter
was
fired
on
and
who
thought
that
after
four
years
of
the
little
unpleasantness
down
south
including
six
months
in
libby
and
after
ten
years
of
fighting
the
bad
indians
on
the
plains
he
was
likely
to
be
much
frightened
by
a
ghost
well
eliphalet
and
the
officer
sat
out
on
the
porch
all
the
evening
smoking
and
talking
over
points
in
military
law
a
little
after
twelve
just
as
they
began
to
think
it
was
about
time
to
turn
in
they
heard
the
most
ghastly
noise
in
the
house
it
was
a
shriek
or
a
howl
or
a
yell
or
anything
they
could
put
a
name
to
it
was
an
undeterminate
inexplicable
shiver
and
shudder
of
sound
which
went
wailing
out
of
the
window
the
officer
had
been
at
cold
harbor
but
he
felt
himself
getting
colder
this
time
eliphalet
knew
it
was
the
ghost
who
haunted
the
house
as
this
weird
sound
died
away
it
was
followed
by
another
sharp
short
in
its
intensity
something
in
this
cry
seemed
familiar
to
eliphalet
and
he
felt
sure
that
it
proceeded
from
the
family
ghost
the
warning
wraith
of
the
duncans
do
i
understand
you
to
intimate
that
both
ghosts
were
there
together
inquired
the
duchess
anxiously
both
of
them
were
there
answered
uncle
larry
you
see
one
of
them
belonged
to
the
house
and
had
to
be
there
all
the
time
and
the
other
was
attached
to
the
person
of
baron
duncan
and
had
to
follow
him
there
wherever
he
was
there
was
that
ghost
also
but
eliphalet
he
had
scarcely
time
to
think
this
out
when
he
heard
both
sounds
again
not
one
after
another
but
both
together
and
something
told
him
some
sort
of
an
instinct
he
had
that
those
two
ghosts
did
agree
did
get
on
together
did
exactly
hit
it
off
in
fact
that
they
were
quarreling
quarreling
ghosts
well
i
never
was
baby
van
rensselaer
remark
it
is
a
blessed
thing
to
see
ghosts
dwell
together
in
unity
said
dear
jones
and
the
duchess
added
it
would
certainly
be
setting
a
better
example
you
know
resumed
uncle
larry
that
two
waves
of
light
or
of
sound
may
interfere
and
produce
darkness
or
silence
so
it
was
with
these
rival
spooks
they
interfered
but
they
did
not
produce
silence
or
darkness
on
the
contrary
as
soon
as
eliphalet
and
the
officer
went
into
the
house
there
began
at
once
a
series
of
spiritualistic
manifestations
a
regular
dark
séance
a
tambourine
was
played
upon
a
bell
was
rung
and
a
flaming
banjo
went
singing
around
the
room
where
did
they
get
the
banjo
asked
dear
jones
sceptically
i
do
know
materialized
it
maybe
just
as
they
did
the
tambourine
you
do
suppose
a
quiet
new
york
lawyer
kept
a
stock
of
musical
instruments
large
enough
to
fit
out
a
strolling
minstrel
troupe
just
on
the
chance
of
a
pair
of
ghosts
coming
to
give
him
a
surprise
party
do
you
every
spook
has
its
own
instrument
of
torture
angels
play
on
harps
i
informed
and
spirits
delight
in
banjos
and
tambourines
these
spooks
of
eliphalet
duncan
were
ghosts
with
all
modern
improvements
and
i
guess
they
were
capable
of
providing
their
own
musical
weapons
at
all
events
they
had
them
there
in
the
little
old
house
at
salem
the
night
eliphalet
and
his
friend
came
down
and
they
played
on
them
and
they
rang
the
bell
and
they
rapped
here
there
and
everywhere
and
they
kept
it
up
all
night
all
night
asked
the
duchess
all
night
long
said
uncle
larry
solemnly
and
the
next
night
too
eliphalet
did
not
get
a
wink
of
sleep
neither
did
his
friend
on
the
second
night
the
house
ghost
was
seen
by
the
officer
on
the
third
night
it
showed
itself
again
and
the
next
morning
the
officer
packed
his
gripsack
and
took
the
first
train
to
boston
he
was
a
new
yorker
but
he
said
he
sooner
go
to
boston
than
see
that
ghost
again
eliphalet
was
scared
at
all
partly
because
he
never
saw
either
the
domiciliary
or
the
titular
spook
and
partly
because
he
felt
himself
on
friendly
terms
with
the
spirit
world
and
did
scare
easily
but
after
losing
three
nights
sleep
and
the
society
of
his
friend
he
began
to
be
a
little
impatient
and
to
think
that
the
thing
had
gone
far
enough
you
see
while
in
a
way
he
was
fond
of
ghosts
yet
he
liked
them
best
one
at
a
time
two
ghosts
were
one
too
many
he
was
bent
on
making
a
collection
of
spooks
he
and
one
ghost
were
company
but
he
and
two
ghosts
were
a
crowd
what
did
he
do
asked
baby
van
rensselaer
well
he
could
do
anything
he
waited
awhile
hoping
they
would
get
tired
but
he
got
tired
out
first
you
see
it
comes
natural
to
a
spook
to
sleep
in
the
daytime
but
a
man
wants
to
sleep
nights
and
they
would
let
him
sleep
nights
they
kept
on
wrangling
and
quarreling
incessantly
they
manifested
and
they
as
regularly
as
the
old
clock
on
the
stairs
struck
twelve
they
rapped
and
they
rang
bells
and
they
banged
the
tambourine
and
they
threw
the
flaming
banjo
about
the
house
and
worse
than
all
they
swore
i
did
not
know
that
spirits
were
addicted
to
bad
language
said
the
duchess
how
did
he
know
they
were
swearing
could
he
hear
them
asked
dear
jones
that
was
just
it
responded
uncle
larry
he
could
not
hear
them
at
least
not
distinctly
there
were
inarticulate
murmurs
and
stifled
rumblings
but
the
impression
produced
on
him
was
that
they
were
swearing
if
they
had
only
sworn
right
out
he
would
not
have
minded
it
so
much
because
he
would
have
known
the
worst
but
the
feeling
that
the
air
was
full
of
suppressed
profanity
was
very
wearing
and
after
standing
it
for
a
week
he
gave
up
in
disgust
and
went
to
the
white
mountains
leaving
them
to
fight
it
out
i
suppose
interjected
baby
van
rensselaer
not
at
all
explained
uncle
larry
they
could
not
quarrel
unless
he
was
present
you
see
he
could
not
leave
the
titular
ghost
behind
him
and
the
domiciliary
ghost
could
not
leave
the
house
when
he
went
away
he
took
the
family
ghost
with
him
leaving
the
house
ghost
behind
now
spooks
ca
quarrel
when
they
are
a
hundred
miles
apart
any
more
than
men
can
and
what
happened
afterwards
asked
baby
van
rensselaer
with
a
pretty
impatience
a
most
marvelous
thing
happened
eliphalet
duncan
went
to
the
white
mountains
and
in
the
car
of
the
railroad
that
runs
to
the
top
of
mount
washington
he
met
a
classmate
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
years
and
this
classmate
introduced
duncan
to
his
sister
and
this
sister
was
a
remarkably
pretty
girl
and
duncan
fell
in
love
with
her
at
first
sight
and
by
the
time
he
got
to
the
top
of
mount
washington
he
was
so
deep
in
love
that
he
began
to
consider
his
own
unworthiness
and
to
wonder
whether
she
might
ever
be
induced
to
care
for
him
a
little
ever
so
little
i
do
think
that
is
so
marvelous
a
thing
said
dear
jones
glancing
at
baby
van
rensselaer
who
was
she
asked
the
duchess
who
had
once
lived
in
philadelphia
she
was
miss
kitty
sutton
of
san
francisco
and
she
was
a
daughter
of
old
judge
sutton
of
the
firm
of
pixley
sutton
a
very
respectable
family
assented
the
duchess
i
hope
she
was
a
daughter
of
that
loud
and
vulgar
old
sutton
whom
i
met
at
saratoga
one
summer
four
or
five
years
ago
said
dear
jones
probably
she
was
uncle
larry
responded
she
was
a
horrid
old
woman
the
boys
used
to
call
her
mother
gorgon
the
pretty
kitty
sutton
with
whom
eliphalet
duncan
had
fallen
in
love
was
the
daughter
of
mother
gorgon
but
he
never
saw
the
mother
who
was
in
frisco
or
los
angeles
or
santa
fé
or
somewhere
out
west
and
he
saw
a
great
deal
of
the
daughter
who
was
up
in
the
white
mountains
she
was
traveling
with
her
brother
and
his
wife
and
as
they
journeyed
from
hotel
to
hotel
duncan
went
with
them
and
filled
out
the
quartette
before
the
end
of
the
summer
he
began
to
think
about
proposing
of
course
he
had
lots
of
chances
going
on
excursions
as
they
were
every
day
he
made
up
his
mind
to
seize
the
first
opportunity
and
that
very
evening
he
took
her
out
for
a
moonlight
row
on
lake
winipiseogee
as
he
handed
her
into
the
boat
he
resolved
to
do
it
and
he
had
a
glimmer
of
suspicion
that
she
knew
he
was
going
to
do
it
too
girls
said
dear
jones
never
go
out
in
a
rowboat
at
night
with
a
young
man
unless
you
mean
to
accept
him
sometimes
it
best
to
refuse
him
and
get
it
over
once
for
all
said
baby
van
rensselaer
impersonally
as
eliphalet
took
the
oars
he
felt
a
sudden
chill
he
tried
to
shake
it
off
but
in
vain
he
began
to
have
a
growing
consciousness
of
impending
evil
before
he
had
taken
ten
strokes
and
he
was
a
swift
oarsman
he
was
aware
of
a
mysterious
presence
between
him
and
miss
sutton
was
it
the
ghost
warning
him
off
the
match
interrupted
dear
jones
that
just
what
it
was
said
uncle
larry
and
he
yielded
to
it
and
kept
his
peace
and
rowed
miss
sutton
back
to
the
hotel
with
his
proposal
unspoken
more
fool
he
said
dear
jones
it
will
take
more
than
one
ghost
to
keep
me
from
proposing
when
my
mind
is
made
up
and
he
looked
at
baby
van
rensselaer
the
next
morning
continued
uncle
larry
eliphalet
overslept
himself
and
when
he
went
down
to
a
late
breakfast
he
found
that
the
suttons
had
gone
to
new
york
by
the
morning
train
he
wanted
to
follow
them
at
once
and
again
he
felt
the
mysterious
presence
overpowering
his
will
he
struggled
two
days
and
at
last
he
roused
himself
to
do
what
he
wanted
in
spite
of
the
spook
when
he
arrived
in
new
york
it
was
late
in
the
evening
he
dressed
himself
hastily
and
went
to
the
hotel
where
the
suttons
were
in
the
hope
of
seeing
at
least
her
brother
the
guardian
angel
fought
every
inch
of
the
walk
with
him
until
he
began
to
wonder
whether
if
miss
sutton
were
to
take
him
the
spook
would
forbid
the
banns
at
the
hotel
he
saw
no
one
that
night
and
he
went
home
determined
to
call
as
early
as
he
could
the
next
afternoon
and
make
an
end
of
it
when
he
left
his
office
about
two
the
next
day
to
learn
his
fate
he
had
not
walked
five
blocks
before
he
discovered
that
the
wraith
of
the
duncans
had
withdrawn
his
opposition
to
the
suit
there
was
no
feeling
of
impending
evil
no
resistance
no
struggle
no
consciousness
of
an
opposing
presence
eliphalet
was
greatly
encouraged
he
walked
briskly
to
the
hotel
he
found
miss
sutton
alone
he
asked
her
the
question
and
got
his
answer
she
accepted
him
of
course
said
baby
van
rensselaer
of
course
said
uncle
larry
and
while
they
were
in
the
first
flush
of
joy
swapping
confidences
and
confessions
her
brother
came
into
the
parlor
with
an
expression
of
pain
on
his
face
and
a
telegram
in
his
hand
the
former
was
caused
by
the
latter
which
was
from
frisco
and
which
announced
the
sudden
death
of
sutton
their
mother
and
that
was
why
the
ghost
no
longer
opposed
the
match
questioned
dear
jones
exactly
you
see
the
family
ghost
knew
that
mother
gorgon
was
an
awful
obstacle
to
duncan
happiness
so
it
warned
him
but
the
moment
the
obstacle
was
removed
it
gave
its
consent
at
once
the
fog
was
lowering
its
thick
damp
curtain
and
it
was
beginning
to
be
difficult
to
see
from
one
end
of
the
boat
to
the
other
dear
jones
tightened
the
rug
which
enwrapped
baby
van
rensselaer
and
then
withdrew
again
into
his
own
substantial
coverings
uncle
larry
paused
in
his
story
long
enough
to
light
another
of
the
tiny
cigars
he
always
smoked
i
infer
that
lord
duncan
the
duchess
was
scrupulous
in
the
bestowal
of
titles
saw
no
more
of
the
ghosts
after
he
was
married
he
never
saw
them
at
all
at
any
time
either
before
or
since
but
they
came
very
near
breaking
off
the
match
and
thus
breaking
two
young
hearts
you
do
mean
to
say
that
they
knew
any
just
cause
or
impediment
why
they
should
not
forever
after
hold
their
peace
asked
dear
jones
how
could
a
ghost
or
even
two
ghosts
keep
a
girl
from
marrying
the
man
she
loved
this
was
baby
van
rensselaer
question
it
seems
curious
does
it
and
uncle
larry
tried
to
warm
himself
by
two
or
three
sharp
pulls
at
his
fiery
little
cigar
and
the
circumstances
are
quite
as
curious
as
the
fact
itself
you
see
miss
sutton
would
be
married
for
a
year
after
her
mother
death
so
she
and
duncan
had
lots
of
time
to
tell
each
other
all
they
knew
eliphalet
got
to
know
a
good
deal
about
the
girls
she
went
to
school
with
and
kitty
soon
learned
all
about
his
family
he
did
tell
her
about
the
title
for
a
long
time
as
he
was
one
to
brag
but
he
described
to
her
the
little
old
house
at
salem
and
one
evening
towards
the
end
of
the
summer
the
having
been
appointed
for
early
in
september
she
told
him
that
she
did
want
a
bridal
tour
at
all
she
just
wanted
to
go
down
to
the
little
old
house
at
salem
to
spend
her
honeymoon
in
peace
and
quiet
with
nothing
to
do
and
nobody
to
bother
them
well
eliphalet
jumped
at
the
suggestion
it
suited
him
down
to
the
ground
all
of
a
sudden
he
remembered
the
spooks
and
it
knocked
him
all
of
a
heap
he
had
told
her
about
the
duncan
banshee
and
the
idea
of
having
an
ancestral
ghost
in
personal
attendance
on
her
husband
tickled
her
immensely
but
he
had
never
said
anything
about
the
ghost
which
haunted
the
little
old
house
at
salem
he
knew
she
would
be
frightened
out
of
her
wits
if
the
house
ghost
revealed
itself
to
her
and
he
saw
at
once
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
go
to
salem
on
their
wedding
trip
so
he
told
her
all
about
it
and
how
whenever
he
went
to
salem
the
two
ghosts
interfered
and
gave
dark
séances
and
manifested
and
materialized
and
made
the
place
absolutely
impossible
kitty
listened
in
silence
and
eliphalet
thought
she
had
changed
her
mind
but
she
had
done
anything
of
the
kind
just
like
a
man
to
think
she
was
going
to
remarked
baby
van
rensselaer
she
just
told
him
she
could
not
bear
ghosts
herself
but
she
would
not
marry
a
man
who
was
afraid
of
them
just
like
a
girl
to
be
so
inconsistent
remarked
dear
jones
uncle
larry
tiny
cigar
had
long
been
extinct
he
lighted
a
new
one
and
continued
eliphalet
protested
in
vain
kitty
said
her
mind
was
made
up
she
was
determined
to
pass
her
honeymoon
in
the
little
old
house
at
salem
and
she
was
equally
determined
not
to
go
there
as
long
as
there
were
any
ghosts
there
until
he
could
assure
her
that
the
spectral
tenant
had
received
notice
to
quit
and
that
there
was
no
danger
of
manifestations
and
materializing
she
refused
to
be
married
at
all
she
did
not
intend
to
have
her
honeymoon
interrupted
by
two
wrangling
ghosts
and
the
wedding
could
be
postponed
until
he
had
made
ready
the
house
for
her
she
was
an
unreasonable
young
woman
said
the
duchess
well
that
what
eliphalet
thought
much
as
he
was
in
love
with
her
and
he
believed
he
could
talk
her
out
of
her
determination
but
he
could
she
was
set
and
when
a
girl
is
set
there
nothing
to
do
but
to
yield
to
the
inevitable
and
that
just
what
eliphalet
did
he
saw
he
would
either
have
to
give
her
up
or
to
get
the
ghosts
out
and
as
he
loved
her
and
did
not
care
for
the
ghosts
he
resolved
to
tackle
the
ghosts
he
had
clear
grit
eliphalet
had
he
was
half
scotch
and
half
yankee
and
neither
breed
turns
tail
in
a
hurry
so
he
made
his
plans
and
he
went
down
to
salem
as
he
said
to
kitty
he
had
an
impression
that
she
was
sorry
she
had
made
him
go
but
she
kept
up
bravely
and
put
a
bold
face
on
it
and
saw
him
off
and
went
home
and
cried
for
an
hour
and
was
perfectly
miserable
until
he
came
back
the
next
day
did
he
succeed
in
driving
the
ghosts
away
asked
baby
van
rensselaer
with
great
interest
that
just
what
i
coming
to
said
uncle
larry
pausing
at
the
critical
moment
in
the
manner
of
the
trained
you
see
eliphalet
had
got
a
rather
tough
job
and
he
would
gladly
have
had
an
extension
of
time
on
the
contract
but
he
had
to
choose
between
the
girl
and
the
ghosts
and
he
wanted
the
girl
he
tried
to
invent
or
remember
some
short
and
easy
way
with
ghosts
but
he
could
he
wished
that
somebody
had
invented
a
specific
for
spooks
something
that
would
make
the
ghosts
come
out
of
the
house
and
die
in
the
yard
he
wondered
if
he
could
not
tempt
the
ghosts
to
run
in
debt
so
that
he
might
get
the
sheriff
to
help
him
he
wondered
also
whether
the
ghosts
could
not
be
overcome
with
strong
drink
a
dissipated
spook
a
spook
with
delirium
tremens
might
be
committed
to
the
inebriate
asylum
but
none
of
these
things
seemed
feasible
what
did
he
do
interrupted
dear
jones
the
learned
counsel
will
please
speak
to
the
point
you
will
regret
this
unseemly
haste
said
uncle
larry
gravely
when
you
know
what
really
happened
what
was
it
uncle
larry
asked
baby
van
rensselaer
i
all
impatience
and
uncle
larry
proceeded
eliphalet
went
down
to
the
little
old
house
at
salem
and
as
soon
as
the
clock
struck
twelve
the
rival
ghosts
began
wrangling
as
before
raps
here
there
and
everywhere
ringing
bells
banging
tambourines
strumming
banjos
sailing
about
the
room
and
all
the
other
manifestations
and
materializations
followed
one
another
just
as
they
had
the
summer
before
the
only
difference
eliphalet
could
detect
was
a
stronger
flavor
in
the
spectral
profanity
and
this
of
course
was
only
a
vague
impression
for
he
did
not
actually
hear
a
single
word
he
waited
awhile
in
patience
listening
and
watching
of
course
he
never
saw
either
of
the
ghosts
because
neither
of
them
could
appear
to
him
at
last
he
got
his
dander
up
and
he
thought
it
was
about
time
to
interfere
so
he
rapped
on
the
table
and
asked
for
silence
as
soon
as
he
felt
that
the
spooks
were
listening
to
him
he
explained
the
situation
to
them
he
told
them
he
was
in
love
and
that
he
could
not
marry
unless
they
vacated
the
house
he
appealed
to
them
as
old
friends
and
he
laid
claim
to
their
gratitude
the
titular
ghost
had
been
sheltered
by
the
duncan
family
for
hundreds
of
years
and
the
domiciliary
ghost
had
had
free
lodging
in
the
little
old
house
at
salem
for
nearly
two
centuries
he
implored
them
to
settle
their
differences
and
to
get
him
out
of
his
difficulty
at
once
he
suggested
that
they
had
better
fight
it
out
then
and
there
and
see
who
was
master
he
had
brought
down
with
him
all
needful
weapons
and
he
pulled
out
his
valise
and
spread
on
the
table
a
pair
of
navy
revolvers
a
pair
of
shotguns
a
pair
of
and
a
couple
of
bowie
knives
he
offered
to
serve
as
second
for
both
parties
and
to
give
the
word
when
to
begin
he
also
took
out
of
his
valise
a
pack
of
cards
and
a
bottle
of
poison
telling
them
that
if
they
wished
to
avoid
carnage
they
might
cut
the
cards
to
see
which
one
should
take
the
poison
then
he
waited
anxiously
for
their
reply
for
a
little
space
there
was
silence
then
he
became
conscious
of
a
tremulous
shivering
in
one
corner
of
the
room
and
he
remembered
that
he
had
heard
from
that
direction
what
sounded
like
a
frightened
sigh
when
he
made
the
first
suggestion
of
the
duel
something
told
him
that
this
was
the
domiciliary
ghost
and
that
it
was
badly
scared
then
he
was
impressed
by
a
certain
movement
in
the
opposite
corner
of
the
room
as
though
the
titular
ghost
were
drawing
himself
up
with
offended
dignity
eliphalet
could
exactly
see
those
things
because
he
never
saw
the
ghosts
but
he
felt
them
after
a
silence
of
nearly
a
minute
a
voice
came
from
the
corner
where
the
family
ghost
stood
a
voice
strong
and
full
but
trembling
slightly
with
suppressed
passion
and
this
voice
told
eliphalet
it
was
plain
enough
that
he
had
not
long
been
the
head
of
the
duncans
and
that
he
had
never
properly
considered
the
characteristics
of
his
race
if
now
he
supposed
that
one
of
his
blood
could
draw
his
sword
against
a
woman
eliphalet
said
he
had
never
suggested
that
the
duncan
ghost
should
raise
his
hand
against
a
woman
and
all
he
wanted
was
that
the
duncan
ghost
should
fight
the
other
ghost
and
then
the
voice
told
eliphalet
that
the
other
ghost
was
a
woman
what
said
dear
jones
sitting
up
suddenly
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
that
the
ghost
which
haunted
the
house
was
a
woman
those
were
the
very
words
eliphalet
duncan
used
said
uncle
larry
but
he
did
not
need
to
wait
for
the
answer
all
at
once
he
recalled
the
traditions
about
the
domiciliary
ghost
and
he
knew
that
what
the
titular
ghost
said
was
the
fact
he
had
never
thought
of
the
sex
of
a
spook
but
there
was
no
doubt
whatever
that
the
house
ghost
was
a
woman
no
sooner
was
this
firmly
fixed
in
eliphalet
mind
than
he
saw
his
way
out
of
the
difficulty
the
ghosts
must
be
married
for
then
there
would
be
no
more
interference
no
more
quarreling
no
more
manifestations
and
materializations
no
more
dark
séances
with
their
raps
and
bells
and
tambourines
and
banjos
at
first
the
ghosts
would
not
hear
of
it
the
voice
in
the
corner
declared
that
the
duncan
wraith
had
never
thought
of
matrimony
but
eliphalet
argued
with
them
and
pleaded
and
pursuaded
and
coaxed
and
dwelt
on
the
advantages
of
matrimony
he
had
to
confess
of
course
that
he
did
not
know
how
to
get
a
clergyman
to
marry
them
but
the
voice
from
the
corner
gravely
told
him
that
there
need
be
no
difficulty
in
regard
to
that
as
there
was
no
lack
of
spiritual
chaplains
then
for
the
first
time
the
house
ghost
spoke
a
low
clear
gentle
voice
and
with
a
quaint
new
england
accent
which
contrasted
sharply
with
the
broad
scotch
speech
of
the
family
ghost
she
said
that
eliphalet
duncan
seemed
to
have
forgotten
that
she
was
married
but
this
did
not
upset
eliphalet
at
all
he
remembered
the
whole
case
clearly
and
he
told
her
she
was
not
a
married
ghost
but
a
widow
since
her
husband
had
been
hanged
for
murdering
her
then
the
duncan
ghost
drew
attention
to
the
great
disparity
in
their
ages
saying
that
he
was
nearly
four
hundred
and
fifty
years
old
while
she
was
barely
two
hundred
but
eliphalet
had
not
talked
to
juries
for
nothing
he
just
buckled
to
and
coaxed
those
ghosts
into
matrimony
afterwards
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
they
were
willing
to
be
coaxed
but
at
the
time
he
thought
he
had
pretty
hard
work
to
convince
them
of
the
advantages
of
the
plan
did
he
succeed
asked
baby
van
rensselaer
with
a
woman
interest
in
matrimony
he
did
said
uncle
larry
he
talked
the
wraith
of
the
duncans
and
the
specter
of
the
little
old
house
at
salem
into
a
matrimonial
engagement
and
from
the
time
they
were
engaged
he
had
no
more
trouble
with
them
they
were
rival
ghosts
no
longer
they
were
married
by
their
spiritual
chaplain
the
very
same
day
that
eliphalet
duncan
met
kitty
sutton
in
front
of
the
railing
of
grace
church
the
ghostly
bride
and
bridegroom
went
away
at
once
on
their
bridal
tour
and
lord
and
lady
duncan
went
down
to
the
little
old
house
at
salem
to
pass
their
honeymoon
uncle
larry
stopped
his
tiny
cigar
was
out
again
the
tale
of
the
rival
ghosts
was
told
a
solemn
silence
fell
on
the
little
party
on
the
deck
of
the
ocean
steamer
broken
harshly
by
the
hoarse
roar
of
the

the

ghost

harrowby
hall
by
john
kendrick
bangs
the
trouble
with
harrowby
hall
was
that
it
was
haunted
and
what
was
worse
the
ghost
did
not
content
itself
with
merely
appearing
at
the
bedside
of
the
afflicted
person
who
saw
it
but
persisted
in
remaining
there
for
one
mortal
hour
before
it
would
disappear
it
never
appeared
except
on
christmas
eve
and
then
as
the
clock
was
striking
twelve
in
which
respect
alone
was
it
lacking
in
that
originality
which
in
these
days
is
a
qua
of
success
in
spectral
life
the
owners
of
harrowby
hall
had
done
their
utmost
to
rid
themselves
of
the
damp
and
dewy
lady
who
rose
up
out
of
the
best
bedroom
floor
at
midnight
but
without
avail
they
had
tried
stopping
the
clock
so
that
the
ghost
would
not
know
when
it
was
midnight
but
she
made
her
appearance
just
the
same
with
that
fearful
miasmatic
personality
of
hers
and
there
she
would
stand
until
everything
about
her
was
thoroughly
saturated
then
the
owners
of
harrowby
hall
caulked
up
every
crack
in
the
floor
with
the
very
best
quality
of
hemp
and
over
this
were
placed
layers
of
tar
and
canvas
the
walls
were
made
waterproof
and
the
doors
and
windows
likewise
the
proprietors
having
conceived
the
notion
that
the
unexorcised
lady
would
find
it
difficult
to
leak
into
the
room
after
these
precautions
had
been
taken
but
even
this
did
not
suffice
the
following
christmas
eve
she
appeared
as
promptly
as
before
and
frightened
the
occupant
of
the
room
quite
out
of
his
senses
by
sitting
down
alongside
of
him
and
gazing
with
her
cavernous
blue
eyes
into
his
and
he
noticed
too
that
in
her
long
aqueously
bony
fingers
bits
of
dripping
seaweed
were
entwined
the
ends
hanging
down
and
these
ends
she
drew
across
his
forehead
until
he
became
like
one
insane
and
then
he
swooned
away
and
was
found
unconscious
in
his
bed
the
next
morning
by
his
host
simply
saturated
with
and
fright
from
the
combined
effects
of
which
he
never
recovered
dying
four
years
later
of
pneumonia
and
nervous
prostration
at
the
age
of
the
next
year
the
master
of
harrowby
hall
decided
not
to
have
the
best
spare
bedroom
opened
at
all
thinking
that
perhaps
the
ghost
thirst
for
making
herself
disagreeable
would
be
satisfied
by
haunting
the
furniture
but
the
plan
was
as
unavailing
as
the
many
that
had
preceded
it
the
ghost
appeared
as
usual
in
the
room
that
is
it
was
supposed
she
did
for
the
hangings
were
dripping
wet
the
next
morning
and
in
the
parlor
below
the
haunted
room
a
great
damp
spot
appeared
on
the
ceiling
finding
no
one
there
she
immediately
set
out
to
learn
the
reason
why
and
she
chose
none
other
to
haunt
than
the
owner
of
the
harrowby
himself
she
found
him
in
his
own
cosey
room
drinking
whiskey
whiskey
undiluted
and
felicitating
himself
upon
having
foiled
her
when
all
of
a
sudden
the
curl
went
out
of
his
hair
his
whiskey
bottle
filled
and
overflowed
and
he
was
himself
in
a
condition
similar
to
that
of
a
man
who
has
fallen
into
a
when
he
recovered
from
the
shock
which
was
a
painful
one
he
saw
before
him
the
lady
of
the
cavernous
eyes
and
seaweed
fingers
the
sight
was
so
unexpected
and
so
terrifying
that
he
fainted
but
immediately
came
to
because
of
the
vast
amount
of
water
in
his
hair
which
trickling
down
over
his
face
restored
his
consciousness
now
it
so
happened
that
the
master
of
harrowby
was
a
brave
man
and
while
he
was
not
particularly
fond
of
interviewing
ghosts
especially
such
quenching
ghosts
as
the
one
before
him
he
was
not
to
be
daunted
by
an
apparition
he
had
paid
the
lady
the
compliment
of
fainting
from
the
effects
of
his
first
surprise
and
now
that
he
had
come
to
he
intended
to
find
out
a
few
things
he
felt
he
had
a
right
to
know
he
would
have
liked
to
put
on
a
dry
suit
of
clothes
first
but
the
apparition
declined
to
leave
him
for
an
instant
until
her
hour
was
up
and
he
was
forced
to
deny
himself
that
pleasure
every
time
he
would
move
she
would
follow
him
with
the
result
that
everything
she
came
in
contact
with
got
a
ducking
in
an
effort
to
warm
himself
up
he
approached
the
fire
an
unfortunate
move
as
it
turned
out
because
it
brought
the
ghost
directly
over
the
fire
which
immediately
was
extinguished
the
whiskey
became
utterly
valueless
as
a
comforter
to
his
chilled
system
because
it
was
by
this
time
diluted
to
a
proportion
of
ninety
per
cent
of
water
the
only
thing
he
could
do
to
ward
off
the
evil
effects
of
his
encounter
he
did
and
that
was
to
swallow
ten
quinine
pills
which
he
managed
to
put
into
his
mouth
before
the
ghost
had
time
to
interfere
having
done
this
he
turned
with
some
asperity
to
the
ghost
and
said
far
be
it
from
me
to
be
impolite
to
a
woman
madam
but
i
hanged
if
it
would
please
me
better
if
you
stop
these
infernal
visits
of
yours
to
this
house
go
sit
out
on
the
lake
if
you
like
that
sort
of
thing
soak
the
if
you
wish
but
do
not
i
implore
you
come
into
a
gentleman
house
and
saturate
him
and
his
possessions
in
this
way
it
is
damned
disagreeable
henry
hartwick
oglethorpe
said
the
ghost
in
a
gurgling
voice
you
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
madam
returned
the
unhappy
householder
i
wish
that
remark
were
strictly
truthful
i
was
talking
about
you
it
would
be
shillings
and
pence
nay
pounds
in
my
pocket
madam
if
i
did
not
know
you
that
is
a
bit
of
specious
nonsense
returned
the
ghost
throwing
a
quart
of
indignation
into
the
face
of
the
master
of
harrowby
it
may
rank
high
as
repartee
but
as
a
comment
upon
my
statement
that
you
do
not
know
what
you
are
talking
about
it
savors
of
irrelevant
impertinence
you
do
not
know
that
i
am
compelled
to
haunt
this
place
year
after
year
by
inexorable
fate
it
is
no
pleasure
to
me
to
enter
this
house
and
ruin
and
mildew
everything
i
touch
i
never
aspired
to
be
a
but
it
is
my
doom
do
you
know
who
i
am
no
i
do
returned
the
master
of
harrowby
i
should
say
you
were
the
lady
of
the
lake
or
little
sallie
waters
you
are
a
witty
man
for
your
years
said
the
ghost
well
my
humor
is
drier
than
yours
ever
will
be
returned
the
master
no
doubt
i
never
dry
i
am
the
water
ghost
of
harrowby
hall
and
dryness
is
a
quality
entirely
beyond
my
wildest
hope
i
have
been
the
incumbent
of
this
highly
unpleasant
office
for
two
hundred
years
how
the
deuce
did
you
ever
come
to
get
elected
asked
the
master
through
a
suicide
replied
the
specter
i
am
the
ghost
of
that
fair
maiden
whose
picture
hangs
over
the
mantelpiece
in
the
i
should
have
been
your
if
i
had
lived
henry
hartwick
oglethorpe
for
i
was
the
own
sister
of
your
but
what
induced
you
to
get
this
house
into
such
a
predicament
i
was
not
to
blame
sir
returned
the
lady
it
was
my
father
fault
he
it
was
who
built
harrowby
hall
and
the
haunted
chamber
was
to
have
been
mine
my
father
had
it
furnished
in
pink
and
yellow
knowing
well
that
blue
and
gray
formed
the
only
combination
of
color
i
could
tolerate
he
did
it
merely
to
spite
me
and
with
what
i
deem
a
proper
spirit
i
declined
to
live
in
the
room
whereupon
my
father
said
i
could
live
there
or
on
the
lawn
he
did
care
which
that
night
i
ran
from
the
house
and
jumped
over
the
cliff
into
the
sea
that
was
rash
said
the
master
of
harrowby
so
i
heard
returned
the
ghost
if
i
had
known
what
the
consequences
were
to
be
i
should
not
have
jumped
but
i
really
never
realized
what
i
was
doing
until
after
i
was
drowned
i
had
been
drowned
a
week
when
a
came
to
me
and
informed
me
that
i
was
to
be
one
of
her
followers
forever
afterwards
adding
that
it
should
be
my
doom
to
haunt
harrowby
hall
for
one
hour
every
christmas
eve
throughout
the
rest
of
eternity
i
was
to
haunt
that
room
on
such
christmas
eves
as
i
found
it
inhabited
and
if
it
should
turn
out
not
to
be
inhabited
i
was
and
am
to
spend
the
allotted
hour
with
the
head
of
the
house
i
sell
the
place
that
you
can
not
do
for
it
is
also
required
of
me
that
i
shall
appear
as
the
deeds
are
to
be
delivered
to
any
purchaser
and
divulge
to
him
the
awful
secret
of
the
house
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
on
every
christmas
eve
that
i
do
happen
to
have
somebody
in
that
you
are
going
to
haunt
me
wherever
i
may
be
ruining
my
whiskey
taking
all
the
curl
out
of
my
hair
extinguishing
my
fire
and
soaking
me
through
to
the
skin
demanded
the
master
you
have
stated
the
case
oglethorpe
and
what
is
more
said
the
water
ghost
it
does
make
the
slightest
difference
where
you
are
if
i
find
that
room
empty
wherever
you
may
be
i
shall
douse
you
with
my
spectral
pres
here
the
clock
struck
one
and
immediately
the
apparition
faded
away
it
was
perhaps
more
of
a
trickle
than
a
fade
but
as
a
disappearance
it
was
complete
by
george
and
his
dragon
ejaculated
the
master
of
harrowby
wringing
his
hands
it
is
guineas
to
buns
that
next
christmas
there
an
occupant
of
the
spare
room
or
i
spend
the
night
in
a
bathtub
but
the
master
of
harrowby
would
have
lost
his
wager
had
there
been
anyone
there
to
take
him
up
for
when
christmas
eve
came
again
he
was
in
his
grave
never
having
recovered
from
the
cold
contracted
that
awful
night
harrowby
hall
was
closed
and
the
heir
to
the
estate
was
in
london
where
to
him
in
his
chambers
came
the
same
experience
that
his
father
had
gone
through
saving
only
that
being
younger
and
stronger
he
survived
the
shock
everything
in
his
rooms
was
ruined
his
clocks
were
rusted
in
the
works
a
fine
collection
of
drawings
was
entirely
obliterated
by
the
onslaught
of
the
water
ghost
and
what
was
worse
the
apartments
below
his
were
drenched
with
the
water
soaking
through
the
floors
a
damage
for
which
he
was
compelled
to
pay
and
which
resulted
in
his
being
requested
by
his
landlady
to
vacate
the
premises
immediately
the
story
of
the
visitation
inflicted
upon
his
family
had
gone
abroad
and
no
one
could
be
got
to
invite
him
out
to
any
function
save
afternoon
teas
and
receptions
fathers
of
daughters
declined
to
permit
him
to
remain
in
their
houses
later
than
eight
at
night
not
knowing
but
that
some
emergency
might
arise
in
the
supernatural
world
which
would
require
the
unexpected
appearance
of
the
water
ghost
in
this
on
nights
other
than
christmas
eve
and
before
the
mystic
hour
when
weary
churchyards
ignoring
the
rules
which
are
supposed
to
govern
polite
society
begin
to
yawn
nor
would
the
maids
themselves
have
aught
to
do
with
him
fearing
the
destruction
by
the
sudden
incursion
of
aqueous
femininity
of
the
costumes
which
they
held
most
dear
so
the
heir
of
harrowby
hall
resolved
as
his
ancestors
for
several
generations
before
him
had
resolved
that
something
must
be
done
his
first
thought
was
to
make
one
of
his
servants
occupy
the
haunted
room
at
the
crucial
moment
but
in
this
he
failed
because
the
servants
themselves
knew
the
history
of
that
room
and
rebelled
none
of
his
friends
would
consent
to
sacrifice
their
personal
comfort
to
his
nor
was
there
to
be
found
in
all
england
a
man
so
poor
as
to
be
willing
to
occupy
the
doomed
chamber
on
christmas
eve
for
pay
then
the
thought
came
to
the
heir
to
have
the
fireplace
in
the
room
enlarged
so
that
he
might
evaporate
the
ghost
at
its
first
appearance
and
he
was
felicitating
himself
upon
the
ingenuity
of
his
plan
when
he
remembered
what
his
father
had
told
him
how
that
no
fire
could
withstand
the
lady
extremely
contagious
dampness
and
then
he
bethought
him
of
these
he
remembered
could
lie
hundreds
of
feet
deep
in
water
and
still
retain
sufficient
heat
to
drive
the
water
away
in
vapor
and
as
a
result
of
this
thought
the
haunted
room
was
heated
by
steam
to
a
withering
degree
and
the
heir
for
six
months
attended
daily
the
turkish
baths
so
that
when
christmas
eve
came
he
could
himself
withstand
the
awful
temperature
of
the
room
the
scheme
was
only
partially
successful
the
water
ghost
appeared
at
the
specified
time
and
found
the
heir
of
harrowby
prepared
but
hot
as
the
room
was
it
shortened
her
visit
by
no
more
than
five
minutes
in
the
hour
during
which
time
the
nervous
system
of
the
young
master
was
shattered
and
the
room
itself
was
cracked
and
warped
to
an
extent
which
required
the
outlay
of
a
large
sum
of
money
to
remedy
and
worse
than
this
as
the
last
drop
of
the
water
ghost
was
slowly
sizzling
itself
out
on
the
floor
she
whispered
to
her
conqueror
that
his
scheme
would
avail
him
nothing
because
there
was
still
water
in
great
plenty
where
she
came
from
and
that
next
year
would
find
her
rehabilitated
and
as
exasperatingly
saturating
as
ever
it
was
then
that
the
natural
action
of
the
mind
in
going
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
suggested
to
the
ingenious
heir
of
harrowby
the
means
by
which
the
water
ghost
was
ultimately
conquered
and
happiness
once
more
came
within
the
grasp
of
the
house
of
oglethorpe
the
heir
provided
himself
with
a
warm
suit
of
fur
donning
this
with
the
furry
side
in
he
placed
over
it
a
rubber
garment
which
he
wore
just
as
a
woman
wears
a
jersey
on
top
of
this
he
placed
another
set
of
this
suit
made
of
wool
and
over
this
was
a
second
rubber
garment
like
the
first
upon
his
head
he
placed
a
light
and
comfortable
diving
helmet
and
so
clad
on
the
following
christmas
eve
he
awaited
the
coming
of
his
tormentor
it
was
a
bitterly
cold
night
that
brought
to
a
close
this
day
of
december
the
air
outside
was
still
but
the
temperature
was
below
zero
within
all
was
quiet
the
servants
of
harrowby
hall
awaiting
with
beating
hearts
the
outcome
of
their
master
campaign
against
his
supernatural
visitor
the
master
himself
was
lying
on
the
bed
in
the
haunted
room
clad
as
has
already
been
indicated
and
then
the
clock
clanged
out
the
hour
of
twelve
there
was
a
sudden
banging
of
doors
a
blast
of
cold
air
swept
through
the
halls
the
door
leading
into
the
haunted
chamber
flew
open
a
splash
was
heard
and
the
water
ghost
was
seen
standing
at
the
side
of
the
heir
of
harrowby
from
whose
outer
dress
there
streamed
rivulets
of
water
but
whose
own
person
deep
down
under
the
various
garments
he
wore
was
as
dry
and
as
warm
as
he
could
have
wished
ha
said
the
young
master
of
harrowby
i
glad
to
see
you
you
are
the
most
original
man
i
met
if
that
is
true
returned
the
ghost
may
i
ask
where
did
you
get
that
hat
certainly
madam
returned
the
master
courteously
it
is
a
little
portable
observatory
i
had
made
for
just
such
emergencies
as
this
but
tell
me
is
it
true
that
you
are
doomed
to
follow
me
about
for
one
mortal
hour
to
stand
where
i
stand
to
sit
where
i
sit
that
is
my
delectable
fate
returned
the
lady
we
go
out
on
the
lake
said
the
master
starting
up
you
ca
get
rid
of
me
that
way
returned
the
ghost
the
water
swallow
me
up
in
fact
it
will
just
add
to
my
present
bulk
nevertheless
said
the
master
firmly
we
will
go
out
on
the
lake
but
my
dear
sir
returned
the
ghost
with
a
pale
reluctance
it
is
fearfully
cold
out
there
you
will
be
frozen
hard
before
you
been
out
ten
minutes
oh
no
i
not
replied
the
master
i
am
very
warmly
dressed
come
this
last
in
a
tone
of
command
that
made
the
ghost
ripple
and
they
started
they
had
not
gone
far
before
the
water
ghost
showed
signs
of
distress
you
walk
too
slowly
she
said
i
am
nearly
frozen
my
knees
are
so
stiff
now
i
can
hardly
move
i
beseech
you
to
accelerate
your
step
i
should
like
to
oblige
a
lady
returned
the
master
courteously
but
my
clothes
are
rather
heavy
and
a
hundred
yards
an
hour
is
about
my
speed
indeed
i
think
we
would
better
sit
down
here
on
this
snowdrift
and
talk
matters
over
do
not
do
not
do
so
i
beg
cried
the
ghost
let
me
move
on
i
feel
myself
growing
rigid
as
it
is
if
we
stop
here
i
shall
be
frozen
stiff
that
madam
said
the
master
slowly
and
seating
himself
on
an
that
is
why
i
have
brought
you
here
we
have
been
on
this
spot
just
ten
minutes
we
have
fifty
more
take
your
time
about
it
madam
but
freeze
that
is
all
i
ask
of
you
i
can
not
move
my
right
leg
now
cried
the
ghost
in

and
my
overskirt
is
a
solid
sheet
of
ice
oh
good
kind
oglethorpe
light
a
fire
and
let
me
go
free
from
these
icy
fetters
never
madam
it
can
not
be
i
have
you
at
last
alas
cried
the
ghost
a
tear
trickling
down
her
frozen
cheek
help
me
i
beg
i
congeal
congeal
madam
congeal
returned
oglethorpe
coldly
you
have
drenched
me
and
mine
for
two
hundred
and
three
years
madam
you
have
had
your
last
drench
ah
but
i
shall
thaw
out
again
and
then
you
see
instead
of
the
comfortably
tepid
genial
ghost
i
have
been
in
my
past
sir
i
shall
be
cried
the
lady
threateningly
no
you
wo
either
returned
oglethorpe
for
when
you
are
frozen
quite
stiff
i
shall
send
you
to
a
warehouse
and
there
shall
you
remain
an
icy
work
of
art
forever
more
but
warehouses
burn
so
they
do
but
this
warehouse
can
not
burn
it
is
made
of
asbestos
and
surrounding
it
are
fireproof
walls
and
within
those
walls
the
temperature
is
now
and
shall
forever
be
degrees
below
the
zero
point
low
enough
to
make
an
icicle
of
any
flame
in
this
world
or

the

added
with
an
chuckle
for
the
last
time
let
me
beseech
you
i
would
go
on
my
knees
to
you
oglethorpe
were
they
not
already
frozen
i
beg
of
you
do
not
doo
here
even
the
words
froze
on
the
lips
and
the
clock
struck
one
there
was
a
momentary
tremor
throughout
the
form
and
the
moon
coming
out
from
behind
a
cloud
shone
down
on
the
rigid
figure
of
a
beautiful
woman
sculptured
in
clear
transparent
ice
there
stood
the
ghost
of
harrowby
hall
conquered
by
the
cold
a
prisoner
for
all
time
the
heir
of
harrowby
had
won
at
last
and
in
a
large
storage
house
in
london
stands
the
frigid
form
of
one
who
will
never
again
flood
the
house
of
oglethorpe
with
woe
and
as
for
the
heir
of
harrowby
his
success
in
coping
with
a
ghost
has
made
him
famous
a
fame
that
still
lingers
about
him
although
his
victory
took
place
some
twenty
years
ago
and
so
far
from
being
unpopular
with
the
fair
sex
as
he
was
when
we
first
knew
him
he
has
not
only
been
married
twice
but
is
to
lead
a
third
bride
to
the
altar
before
the
year
is
out
back
from
that
bourne
anonymous
from
the
new
york
by
permission
of
the
editor
back
from
that
bourne
anonymous
working
of
materialization
in
maine
a
strange
story
from
pocock
island
a
materialized
spirit
that
will
not
go
back
the
first
glimpse
of
what
may
yet
cause
very
extensive
trouble
in
this
the
saturday
december
we
are
permitted
to
make
extracts
from
a
private
letter
which
bears
the
signature
of
a
gentleman
well
known
in
business
circles
and
whose
veracity
we
have
never
heard
called
in
question
his
statements
are
startling
and
incredible
but
if
true
they
are
susceptible
of
easy
verification
yet
the
thoughtful
mind
will
hesitate
about
accepting
them
without
the
fullest
proof
for
they
spring
upon
the
world
a
social
problem
of
stupendous
importance
the
dangers
apprehended
by
malthus
and
his
followers
become
remote
and
commonplace
by
the
side
of
this
new
and
terrible
issue
the
letter
is
dated
at
pocock
island
a
small
township
in
washington
county
maine
about
seventeen
miles
from
the
mainland
and
nearly
midway
between
mt
desert
and
the
grand
menan
the
last
state
census
accords
to
pocock
island
a
population
of
mostly
engaged
in
the
porgy
fisheries
at
the
presidential
election
of
the
island
gave
grant
a
majority
of
three
these
two
facts
are
all
that
we
are
able
to
learn
of
the
locality
from
sources
outside
of
the
letter
already
referred
to
the
letter
omitting
certain
passages
which
refer
solely
to
private
matters
reads
as
follows
but
enough
of
the
disagreeable
business
that
brought
me
here
to
this
bleak
island
in
the
month
of
november
i
have
a
singular
story
to
tell
you
after
our
experience
together
at
chittenden
i
know
you
will
not
reject
statements
because
they
are
startling
my
friend
there
is
upon
pocock
island
a
materialized
spirit
which
or
who
refuses
to
be
dematerialized
at
this
moment
and
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
me
as
i
write
a
man
who
died
and
was
buried
four
years
ago
and
who
has
exploited
the
mysteries
beyond
the
grave
walks
talks
and
holds
interviews
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
island
and
is
to
all
appearances
determined
to
remain
permanently
upon
this
side
of
the
river
i
will
relate
the
circumstances
as
briefly
as
i
can
john
newbegin
in
april
john
newbegin
died
and
was
buried
in
the
little
cemetery
on
the
landward
side
of
the
island
newbegin
was
a
man
of
about
without
family
or
near
connections
and
eccentric
to
a
degree
that
sometimes
inspired
questions
as
to
his
sanity
what
money
he
had
earned
by
many
seasons
fishing
upon
the
banks
was
invested
in
quarters
of
two
small
mackerel
schooners
the
remainder
of
which
belonged
to
john
hodgeson
the
richest
man
on
pocock
who
was
estimated
by
good
authorities
to
be
worth
thirteen
or
fourteen
thousand
dollars
newbegin
was
not
without
a
certain
kind
of
culture
he
had
read
a
good
deal
of
the
odds
and
ends
of
literature
and
as
a
islander
expressed
it
in
my
hearing
knew
more
bookfuls
than
anybody
on
the
island
he
was
naturally
an
intelligent
man
and
he
might
have
attained
influence
in
the
community
had
it
not
been
for
his
utter
aimlessness
of
character
his
indifference
to
fortune
and
his
consuming
thirst
for
rum
many
yachtsmen
who
have
had
occasion
to
stop
at
pocock
for
water
or
for
harbor
shelter
during
eastern
cruises
will
remember
a
long
listless
figure
astonishingly
attired
in
blue
army
pants
rubber
boots
loose
toga
made
of
some
bright
chintz
material
and
very
bad
hat
staggering
through
the
little
settlement
followed
by
a
rabble
of
jeering
brats
and
pausing
to
strike
uncertain
blows
at
those
within
reach
of
the
dead
sculpin
which
he
usually
carried
round
by
the
tail
this
was
john
newbegin
his
sudden
death
as
i
have
already
remarked
he
died
four
years
ago
last
april
the
one
of
the
little
schooners
in
which
he
owned
had
returned
from
the
eastward
and
had
smuggled
or
in
a
quantity
of
john
brandy
newbegin
had
a
solitary
and
protracted
debauch
he
was
missed
from
his
accustomed
walks
for
several
days
and
when
the
islanders
broke
into
the
hovel
where
he
lived
close
down
to
the
seaweed
and
almost
within
reach
of
the
incoming
tide
they
found
him
dead
on
the
floor
with
an
emptied
demijohn
hard
by
his
head
after
the
primitive
custom
of
the
island
they
interred
john
remains
without
coroner
inquest
burial
certificate
or
funeral
services
and
in
the
excitement
of
a
large
catch
of
porgies
that
summer
soon
forgot
him
and
his
friendless
life
his
interest
in
the
and
the
recurred
to
john
hodgeson
and
as
nobody
came
forward
to
demand
an
administration
of
the
estate
it
was
never
administered
the
forms
of
law
are
but
loosely
followed
in
some
of
these
marginal
localities
his
reappearance
at
pocock
well
my
dear
four
years
and
four
months
had
brought
their
quota
of
varying
seasons
to
pocock
island
when
john
newbegin
reappeared
under
the
following
circumstances
in
the
latter
part
of
last
august
as
you
may
remember
there
was
a
heavy
gale
all
along
our
atlantic
coast
during
this
storm
the
squadron
of
the
naugatuck
yacht
club
which
was
returning
from
a
summer
cruise
as
far
as
campobello
was
forced
to
take
shelter
in
the
harbor
to
the
leeward
of
pocock
island
the
gentlemen
of
the
club
spent
three
days
at
the
little
settlement
ashore
among
the
party
was
r
e
by
which
name
you
will
recognize
a
medium
of
celebrity
and
one
who
has
been
particularly
successful
in
materializations
at
the
desire
of
his
companions
and
to
relieve
the
tedium
of
their
detention
e
improvised
a
cabinet
in
the
little
schoolhouse
at
pocock
and
gave
a
to
the
delight
of
his
fellow
yachtsmen
and
the
utter
bewilderment
of
such
natives
as
were
permitted
to
witness
the
manifestations
the
conditions
appeared
unusually
favorable
to
spirit
appearances
and
the
was
upon
the
whole
perhaps
the
most
remarkable
that
e
ever
held
it
was
all
the
more
remarkable
because
the
surroundings
were
such
that
the
most
prejudiced
skeptic
could
discover
no
possibility
of
trickery
the
first
form
to
issue
from
the
wood
closet
which
constituted
the
cabinet
when
e
had
been
tied
therein
by
a
committee
of
old
sailors
from
the
yachts
was
that
of
an
indian
chief
who
announced
himself
as
and
who
retired
after
dancing
a
and
declaring
himself
in
very
emphatic
terms
as
opposed
to
the
present
indian
policy
of
the
administration
was
succeeded
by
the
aunt
of
one
of
the
yachtsmen
who
identified
herself
beyond
question
by
allusion
to
family
matters
and
by
displaying
the
scar
of
a
burn
upon
her
left
arm
received
while
making
tomato
catsup
upon
earth
then
came
successively
a
child
whom
none
present
recognized
a
french
canadian
who
could
not
talk
english
and
a
portly
gentleman
who
introduced
himself
as
william
king
first
governor
of
maine
these
in
turn
reëntered
the
cabinet
and
were
seen
no
more
it
was
some
time
before
another
spirit
manifested
itself
and
e
gave
directions
that
the
lights
be
turned
down
still
further
then
the
door
of
the
wood
closet
was
slowly
opened
and
a
singular
figure
in
rubber
boots
and
a
species
of
dolly
varden
garment
emerged
bringing
a
dead
fish
in
his
right
hand
his
determination
to
remain
the
city
men
who
were
present
i
am
told
thought
that
the
medium
was
masquerading
in
grotesque
habiliments
for
the
more
complete
astonishment
of
the
islanders
but
these
latter
rose
from
their
seats
and
exclaimed
with
one
consent
is
john
newbegin
and
then
in
not
unnatural
terror
of
the
apparition
they
turned
and
fled
from
the
schoolroom
uttering
dismal
cries
john
newbegin
came
calmly
forward
and
turned
up
the
solitary
kerosene
lamp
that
shed
uncertain
light
over
the
proceedings
he
then
sat
down
in
the
teacher
chair
folded
his
arms
and
looked
complacently
about
him
might
as
well
untie
the
medium
he
finally
remarked
propose
to
remain
in
the
materialized
condition
and
he
did
remain
when
the
party
left
the
schoolhouse
among
them
walked
john
newbegin
as
truly
a
being
of
flesh
and
blood
as
any
man
of
them
from
that
day
to
this
he
has
been
a
living
inhabitant
of
pocock
island
eating
drinking
water
only
and
sleeping
after
the
manner
of
men
the
yachtsmen
who
made
sail
for
bar
harbor
the
very
next
morning
probably
believe
that
he
was
a
fraud
hired
for
the
occasion
by
e
but
the
people
of
pocock
who
laid
him
out
dug
his
grave
and
put
him
into
it
four
years
ago
know
that
john
newbegin
has
come
back
to
them
from
a
land
they
know
not
of
a
singular
member
of
society
the
idea
of
having
a
ghost
somewhat
more
condensed
it
is
true
than
the
traditional
ghost
as
a
member
was
not
at
first
overpleasing
to
the
inhabitants
of
pocock
island
to
this
day
they
are
a
little
sensitive
upon
the
subject
feeling
evidently
that
if
the
matter
got
abroad
it
might
injure
the
sale
of
the
really
excellent
porgy
oil
which
is
the
product
of
their
sole
manufacturing
interest
this
reluctance
to
advertise
the
skeleton
in
their
closet
superadded
to
the
slowness
of
these
obtuse
fishy
people
to
recognize
the
transcendent
importance
of
the
case
must
be
accepted
as
explanation
of
the
fact
that
john
newbegin
spirit
has
been
on
earth
between
three
and
four
months
and
yet
the
singular
circumstance
is
not
known
to
the
whole
country
but
the
pocockians
have
at
last
come
to
see
that
a
spirit
is
not
necessarily
a
malevolent
spirit
and
accepting
his
presence
as
a
fact
in
their
stolid
unreasoning
way
they
are
quite
neighborly
and
sociable
with
newbegin
i
know
that
your
first
question
will
be
there
sufficient
proof
of
his
ever
having
been
dead
to
this
i
answer
unhesitatingly
he
was
too
a
character
and
too
many
people
saw
the
corpse
to
admit
of
any
mistake
on
this
point
i
may
add
here
that
it
was
at
one
time
proposed
to
disinter
the
original
remains
but
that
project
was
abandoned
in
deference
to
the
wishes
of
newbegin
who
feels
a
natural
delicacy
about
having
his
first
set
of
bones
disturbed
from
motives
of
mere
curiosity
an
interview
with
a
dead
man
you
will
readily
believe
that
i
took
occasion
to
see
and
converse
with
john
newbegin
i
found
him
affable
and
even
communicative
he
is
perfectly
aware
of
his
doubtful
status
as
a
being
but
is
in
hopes
that
at
some
future
time
there
may
be
legislation
that
shall
correctly
define
his
position
and
the
position
of
any
spirit
who
may
follow
him
into
the
material
world
the
only
point
upon
which
he
is
reticent
is
his
experience
during
the
four
years
that
elapsed
between
his
death
and
his
reappearance
at
pocock
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
the
memory
is
not
a
pleasant
one
at
least
he
never
speaks
of
this
period
he
candidly
admits
however
that
he
is
glad
to
get
back
to
earth
and
that
he
embraced
the
very
first
opportunity
to
be
materialized
newbegin
says
that
he
is
consumed
with
remorse
for
the
wasted
years
of
his
previous
existence
indeed
his
conduct
during
the
past
three
months
would
show
that
this
regret
is
genuine
he
has
discarded
his
eccentric
costume
and
dresses
like
a
reasonable
spirit
he
has
not
touched
liquor
since
his
reappearance
he
has
embarked
in
the
porgy
oil
business
and
his
operations
already
rival
that
of
hodgeson
his
old
partner
in
the
and
the
by
the
way
newbegin
threatens
to
sue
hodgeson
for
his
individed
quarter
in
each
of
these
vessels
and
this
interesting
case
therefore
bids
fair
to
be
thoroughly
investigated
in
the
courts
as
a
business
man
he
is
generally
esteemed
on
the
island
although
there
is
a
noticeable
reluctance
to
discount
his
paper
at
long
dates
in
short
john
newbegin
is
a
most
respectable
citizen
if
a
dead
man
can
be
a
citizen
and
has
announced
his
intention
of
running
for
the
next
legislature
in
conclusion
and
now
my
dear
i
have
told
you
the
substance
of
all
i
know
respecting
this
strange
strange
case
yet
after
all
why
so
strange
we
accepted
materialization
at
chittenden
is
this
any
more
than
the
logical
issue
of
that
admission
if
the
spirit
may
return
to
earth
clothed
in
flesh
and
blood
and
all
the
physical
attributes
of
humanity
why
may
it
not
remain
on
earth
as
long
as
it
sees
fit
thinking
of
it
from
whatever
standpoint
i
can
not
but
regard
john
newbegin
as
the
pioneer
of
a
possibly
large
immigration
from
the
spirit
world
the
bars
once
down
a
whole
flock
will
come
trooping
back
to
earth
death
will
lose
its
significance
altogether
and
when
i
think
of
the
disturbance
which
will
result
in
our
social
relations
of
the
overthrow
of
all
accepted
institutions
and
of
the
nullification
of
all
principles
of
political
economy
law
and
religion
i
am
lost
in
perplexity
and
apprehension

strangers

vasty
houses
and
streets
can
call
us
rustics
if
they
choose
but
for
all
that
fairfield
is
a
better
place
to
live
in
than
london
doctor
says
that
when
he
goes
to
london
his
mind
is
bruised
with
the
weight
of
the
houses
and
he
was
a
cockney
born
he
had
to
live
there
himself
when
he
was
a
little
chap
but
he
knows
better
now
you
gentlemen
may
laugh
perhaps
some
of
you
come
from
but
it
seems
to
me
that
a
witness
like
that
is
worth
a
gallon
of
arguments
dull
well
you
might
find
it
dull
but
i
assure
you
that
i
listened
to
all
the
london
yarns
you
have
spun
and
they
absolutely
nothing
to
the
things
that
happen
at
fairfield
it
because
of
our
way
of
thinking
and
minding
our
own
business
if
one
of
your
londoners
was
set
down
on
the
green
of
a
saturday
night
when
the
ghosts
of
the
lads
who
died
in
the
war
keep
tryst
with
the
lasses
who
lie
in
the
churchyard
he
could
help
being
curious
and
interfering
and
then
the
ghosts
would
go
somewhere
where
it
was
quieter
but
we
just
let
them
come
and
go
and
do
make
any
fuss
and
in
consequence
fairfield
is
the
ghostiest
place
in
all
england
why
i
seen
a
headless
man
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
well
in
broad
daylight
and
the
children
playing
about
his
feet
as
if
he
were
their
father
take
my
word
for
it
spirits
know
when
they
are
well
off
as
much
as
human
beings
still
i
must
admit
that
the
thing
i
going
to
tell
you
about
was
queer
even
for
our
part
of
the
world
where
three
packs
of
hunt
regularly
during
the
season
and
blacksmith
is
busy
all
night
shoeing
the
dead
gentlemen
horses
now
that
a
thing
that
would
happen
in
london
because
of
their
interfering
ways
but
blacksmith
he
lies
up
aloft
and
sleeps
as
quiet
as
a
lamb
once
when
he
had
a
bad
head
he
shouted
down
to
them
not
to
make
so
much
noise
and
in
the
morning
he
found
an
old
guinea
left
on
the
anvil
as
an
apology
he
wears
it
on
his
now
but
i
must
get
on
with
my
story
if
i
start
telling
you
about
the
queer
happenings
at
fairfield
i
never
stop
it
all
came
of
the
great
storm
in
the
spring
of
the
year
that
we
had
two
great
storms
this
was
the
first
one
and
i
remember
it
well
because
i
found
in
the
morning
that
it
had
lifted
the
thatch
of
my
pigsty
into
the
widow
garden
as
clean
as
a
boy
kite
when
i
looked
over
the
hedge
widow
tom
lamport
widow
that
was
was
prodding
for
her
nasturtiums
with
a
daisy
grubber
after
i
had
watched
her
for
a
little
i
went
down
to
the
fox
and
grapes
to
tell
landlord
what
she
had
said
to
me
landlord
he
laughed
being
a
married
man
and
at
ease
with
the
sex
come
to
that
he
said
the
tempest
has
blowed
something
into
my
field
a
kind
of
a
ship
i
think
it
would
be
i
was
surprised
at
that
until
he
explained
that
it
was
only
a
and
would
do
no
hurt
to
the
turnips
we
argued
that
it
had
been
blown
up
from
the
sea
at
portsmouth
and
then
we
talked
of
something
else
there
were
two
slates
down
at
the
parsonage
and
a
big
tree
in
lumley
meadow
it
was
a
rare
storm
i
reckon
the
wind
had
blown
our
ghosts
all
over
england
they
were
coming
back
for
days
afterward
with
foundered
horses
and
as
footsore
as
possible
and
they
were
so
glad
to
get
back
to
fairfield
that
some
of
them
walked
up
the
street
crying
like
little
children
squire
said
that
his
had
looked
so
since
the
battle
of
naseby
and
he
an
educated
man
what
with
one
thing
and
another
i
should
think
it
was
a
week
before
we
got
straight
again
and
then
one
afternoon
i
met
the
landlord
on
the
green
and
he
had
a
worried
face
i
wish
you
come
and
have
a
look
at
that
ship
in
my
field
he
said
to
me
it
seems
to
me
it
leaning
real
hard
on
the
turnips
i
ca
bear
thinking
what
the
missus
will
say
when
she
sees
it
i
walked
down
the
lane
with
him
and
sure
enough
there
was
a
ship
in
the
middle
of
his
field
but
such
a
ship
as
no
man
had
seen
on
the
water
for
three
hundred
years
let
alone
in
the
middle
of
a
turnipfield
it
was
all
painted
black
and
covered
with
carvings
and
there
was
a
great
in
the
stern
for
all
the
world
like
the
there
was
a
crowd
of
little
black
cannon
on
deck
and
looking
out
of
her
and
she
was
anchored
at
each
end
to
the
hard
ground
i
have
seen
the
wonders
of
the
world
on
but
i
have
never
seen
anything
to
equal
that
she
seems
very
solid
for
a
i
said
seeing
that
landlord
was
bothered
i
should
say
it
a
betwixt
and
between
he
answered
puzzling
it
over
but
it
going
to
spoil
a
matter
of
fifty
turnips
and
missus
she
want
it
moved
we
went
up
to
her
and
touched
the
side
and
it
was
as
hard
as
a
real
ship
now
there
folks
in
england
would
call
that
very
curious
he
said
now
i
do
know
much
about
ships
but
i
should
think
that
that
weighed
a
solid
two
hundred
tons
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
she
had
come
to
stay
so
that
i
felt
sorry
for
landlord
who
was
a
married
man
all
the
horses
in
fairfield
wo
move
her
out
of
my
turnips
he
said
frowning
at
her
just
then
we
heard
a
noise
on
her
deck
and
we
looked
up
and
saw
that
a
man
had
come
out
of
her
front
cabin
and
was
looking
down
at
us
very
peaceably
he
was
dressed
in
a
black
uniform
set
off
with
rusty
gold
lace
and
he
had
a
great
cutlass
by
his
side
in
a
brass
sheath
captain
bartholomew
roberts
he
said
in
a
gentleman
voice
put
in
for
recruits
i
seem
to
have
brought
her
rather
far
up
the
harbor
harbor
cried
landlord
why
you
fifty
miles
from
the
sea
captain
roberts
did
turn
a
hair
so
much
as
that
is
it
he
said
coolly
well
it
of
no
consequence
landlord
was
a
bit
upset
at
this
i
do
want
to
be
unneighborly
he
said
but
i
wish
you
had
brought
your
ship
into
my
field
you
see
my
wife
sets
great
store
on
these
turnips
the
captain
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
out
of
a
fine
gold
box
that
he
pulled
out
of
his
pocket
and
dusted
his
fingers
with
a
silk
handkerchief
in
a
very
genteel
fashion
i
only
here
for
a
few
months
he
said
but
if
a
testimony
of
my
esteem
would
pacify
your
good
lady
i
should
be
content
and
with
the
words
he
loosed
a
great
gold
brooch
from
the
neck
of
his
coat
and
tossed
it
down
to
landlord
landlord
blushed
as
red
as
a
strawberry
i
not
denying
she
fond
of
jewelry
he
said
but
it
too
much
for
half
a
sackful
of
turnips
indeed
it
was
a
handsome
brooch
the
captain
laughed
tut
man
he
said
it
a
forced
sale
and
you
deserve
a
good
price
say
no
more
about
it
and
nodding
good
day
to
us
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
went
into
the
cabin
landlord
walked
back
up
the
lane
like
a
man
with
a
weight
off
his
mind
that
tempest
has
blowed
me
a
bit
of
luck
he
said
the
missus
will
be
main
pleased
with
that
brooch
it
better
than
blacksmith
guinea
any
day
was
jubilee
year
the
year
of
the
second
jubilee
you
remember
and
we
had
great
doings
at
fairfield
so
that
we
had
much
time
to
bother
about
the
though
anyhow
it
is
our
way
to
meddle
in
things
that
do
concern
us
landlord
he
saw
his
tenant
once
or
twice
when
he
was
hoeing
his
turnips
and
passed
the
time
of
day
and
landlord
wife
wore
her
new
brooch
to
church
every
sunday
but
we
did
mix
much
with
the
ghosts
at
any
time
all
except
an
idiot
lad
there
was
in
the
village
and
he
did
know
the
difference
between
a
man
and
a
ghost
poor
innocent
on
jubilee
day
however
somebody
told
captain
roberts
why
the
church
bells
were
ringing
and
he
hoisted
a
flag
and
fired
off
his
guns
like
a
loyal
englishman
is
true
the
guns
were
shotted
and
one
of
the
round
shot
knocked
a
hole
in
farmer
johnstone
barn
but
nobody
thought
much
of
that
in
such
a
season
of
rejoicing
it
was
till
our
celebrations
were
over
that
we
noticed
that
anything
was
wrong
in
fairfield
was
shoemaker
who
told
me
first
about
it
one
morning
at
the
fox
and
grapes
you
know
my
he
said
to
me
you
mean
joshua
the
quiet
lad
i
answered
knowing
him
well
quiet
said
shoemaker
indignantly
quiet
you
call
him
coming
home
at
three
every
morning
as
drunk
as
a
magistrate
and
waking
up
the
whole
house
with
his
noise
why
it
ca
be
joshua
i
said
for
i
knew
him
for
one
of
the
most
respectable
young
ghosts
in
the
village
joshua
it
is
said
shoemaker
and
one
of
these
nights
he
find
himself
out
in
the
street
if
he
is
careful
this
kind
of
talk
shocked
me
i
can
tell
you
for
i
do
like
to
hear
a
man
abusing
his
own
family
and
i
could
hardly
believe
that
a
steady
youngster
like
joshua
had
taken
to
drink
but
just
then
in
came
butcher
aylwin
in
such
a
temper
that
he
could
hardly
drink
his
beer
the
young
puppy
the
young
puppy
he
kept
on
saying
and
it
was
some
time
before
shoemaker
and
i
found
out
that
he
was
talking
about
his
ancestor
that
fell
at
senlac
drink
said
shoemaker
hopefully
for
we
all
like
company
in
our
misfortunes
and
butcher
nodded
grimly
the
young
noodle
he
said
emptying
his
tankard
well
after
that
i
kept
my
ears
open
and
it
was
the
same
story
all
over
the
village
there
was
hardly
a
young
man
among
all
the
ghosts
of
fairfield
who
did
roll
home
in
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
the
worse
for
liquor
i
used
to
wake
up
in
the
night
and
hear
them
stumble
past
my
house
singing
outrageous
songs
the
worst
of
it
was
that
we
could
keep
the
scandal
to
ourselves
and
the
folk
at
greenhill
began
to
talk
of
sodden
fairfield
and
taught
their
children
to
sing
a
song
about
us
sodden
fairfield
sodden
fairfield
has
no
use
for
bread
and
butter
rum
for
breakfast
rum
for
dinner
rum
for
tea
and
rum
for
supper
we
are
in
our
village
but
we
did
like
that
of
course
we
soon
found
out
where
the
young
fellows
went
to
get
the
drink
and
landlord
was
terribly
cut
up
that
his
tenant
should
have
turned
out
so
badly
but
his
wife
would
hear
of
parting
with
the
brooch
so
he
could
give
the
captain
notice
to
quit
but
as
time
went
on
things
grew
from
bad
to
worse
and
at
all
hours
of
the
day
you
would
see
those
young
reprobates
sleeping
it
off
on
the
village
green
nearly
every
afternoon
a
used
to
jolt
down
to
the
ship
with
a
lading
of
rum
and
though
the
older
ghosts
seemed
inclined
to
give
the
captain
hospitality
the
the
youngsters
were
neither
to
hold
nor
to
bind
so
one
afternoon
when
i
was
taking
my
nap
i
heard
a
knock
at
the
door
and
there
was
parson
looking
very
serious
like
a
man
with
a
job
before
him
that
he
did
altogether
relish
i
going
down
to
talk
to
the
captain
about
all
this
drunkenness
in
the
village
and
i
want
you
to
come
with
me
he
said
straight
out
i
ca
say
that
i
fancied
the
visit
much
myself
and
i
tried
to
hint
to
parson
that
as
after
all
they
were
only
a
lot
of
ghosts
it
much
matter
dead
or
alive
i
responsible
for
their
good
conduct
he
said
and
i
going
to
do
my
duty
and
put
a
stop
to
this
continued
disorder
and
you
are
coming
with
me
john
simmons
so
i
went
parson
being
a
persuasive
kind
of
man
we
went
down
to
the
ship
and
as
we
approached
her
i
could
see
the
captain
tasting
the
air
on
deck
when
he
saw
parson
he
took
off
his
hat
very
politely
and
i
can
tell
you
that
i
was
relieved
to
find
that
he
had
a
proper
respect
for
the
cloth
parson
acknowledged
his
salute
and
spoke
out
stoutly
enough
sir
i
should
be
glad
to
have
a
word
with
you
come
on
board
sir
come
on
board
said
the
captain
and
i
could
tell
by
his
voice
that
he
knew
why
we
were
there
parson
and
i
climbed
up
an
uneasy
kind
of
ladder
and
the
captain
took
us
into
the
great
cabin
at
the
back
of
the
ship
where
the
was
it
was
the
most
wonderful
place
you
ever
saw
in
your
life
all
full
of
gold
and
silver
plate
swords
with
jeweled
scabbards
carved
oak
chairs
and
great
chests
that
looked
as
though
they
were
bursting
with
guineas
even
parson
was
surprised
and
he
did
not
shake
his
head
very
hard
when
the
captain
took
down
some
silver
cups
and
poured
us
out
a
drink
of
rum
i
tasted
mine
and
i
do
mind
saying
that
it
changed
my
view
of
things
entirely
there
was
nothing
betwixt
and
between
about
that
rum
and
i
felt
that
it
was
ridiculous
to
blame
the
lads
for
drinking
too
much
of
stuff
like
that
it
seemed
to
fill
my
veins
with
honey
and
fire
parson
put
the
case
squarely
to
the
captain
but
i
did
listen
much
to
what
he
said
i
was
busy
sipping
my
drink
and
looking
through
the
window
at
the
fishes
swimming
to
and
fro
over
landlord
turnips
just
then
it
seemed
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
that
they
should
be
there
though
afterward
of
course
i
could
see
that
that
proved
it
was
a
but
even
then
i
thought
it
was
queer
when
i
saw
a
drowned
sailor
float
by
in
the
thin
air
with
his
hair
and
beard
all
full
of
bubbles
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
seen
anything
quite
like
that
at
fairfield
all
the
time
i
was
regarding
the
wonders
of
the
deep
parson
was
telling
captain
roberts
how
there
was
no
peace
or
rest
in
the
village
owing
to
the
curse
of
drunkenness
and
what
a
bad
example
the
youngsters
were
setting
to
the
older
ghosts
the
captain
listened
very
attentively
and
put
in
a
word
only
now
and
then
about
boys
being
boys
and
young
men
sowing
their
wild
oats
but
when
parson
had
finished
his
speech
he
filled
up
our
silver
cups
and
said
to
parson
with
a
flourish
i
should
be
sorry
to
cause
trouble
anywhere
where
i
have
been
made
welcome
and
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
i
put
to
sea
night
and
now
you
must
drink
me
a
prosperous
voyage
so
we
all
stood
up
and
drank
the
toast
with
honor
and
that
noble
rum
was
like
hot
oil
in
my
veins
after
that
captain
showed
us
some
of
the
curiosities
he
had
brought
back
from
foreign
parts
and
we
were
greatly
amazed
though
afterward
i
could
clearly
remember
what
they
were
and
then
i
found
myself
walking
across
the
turnips
with
parson
and
i
was
telling
him
of
the
glories
of
the
deep
that
i
had
seen
through
the
window
of
the
ship
he
turned
on
me
severely
if
i
were
you
john
simmons
he
said
i
should
go
straight
home
to
bed
he
has
a
way
of
putting
things
that
would
occur
to
an
ordinary
man
has
parson
and
i
did
as
he
told
me
well
next
day
it
came
on
to
blow
and
it
blew
harder
and
harder
till
about
eight
at
night
i
heard
a
noise
and
looked
out
into
the
garden
i
dare
say
you
wo
believe
me
it
seems
a
bit
tall
even
to
me
but
the
wind
had
lifted
the
thatch
of
my
pigsty
into
the
garden
a
second
time
i
thought
i
would
wait
to
hear
what
widow
had
to
say
about
it
so
i
went
across
the
green
to
the
fox
and
grapes
and
the
wind
was
so
strong
that
i
danced
along
on
tiptoe
like
a
girl
at
the
fair
when
i
got
to
the
inn
landlord
had
to
help
me
shut
the
door
it
seemed
as
though
a
dozen
goats
were
pushing
against
it
to
come
in
out
of
the
storm
it
a
powerful
tempest
he
said
drawing
the
beer
i
hear
there
a
chimney
down
at
dickory
end
it
a
funny
thing
how
these
sailors
know
about
the
weather
i
answered
when
captain
said
he
was
going
i
was
thinking
it
would
take
a
capful
of
wind
to
carry
the
ship
back
to
sea
and
now
here
more
than
a
capful
ah
yes
said
landlord
it
he
goes
true
enough
and
mind
you
though
he
treated
me
handsome
over
the
rent
i
not
sure
it
a
loss
to
the
village
i
do
hold
with
gentrice
who
fetch
their
drink
from
london
instead
of
helping
local
traders
to
get
their
living
but
you
have
got
any
rum
like
his
i
said
to
draw
him
out
his
neck
grew
red
above
his
collar
and
i
was
afraid
i
gone
too
far
but
after
a
while
he
got
his
breath
with
a
grunt
john
simmons
he
said
if
you
come
down
here
this
windy
night
to
talk
a
lot
of
fool
talk
you
wasted
a
journey
well
of
course
then
i
had
to
smooth
him
down
with
praising
his
rum
and
heaven
forgive
me
for
swearing
it
was
better
than
captain
for
the
like
of
that
rum
no
living
lips
have
tasted
save
mine
and
parson
but
somehow
or
other
i
brought
landlord
round
and
presently
we
must
have
a
glass
of
his
best
to
prove
its
quality
beat
that
if
you
can
he
cried
and
we
both
raised
our
glasses
to
our
mouths
only
to
stop
halfway
and
look
at
each
other
in
amaze
for
the
wind
that
had
been
howling
outside
like
an
outrageous
dog
had
all
of
a
sudden
turned
as
melodious
as
the
of
a
christmas
eve
surely
that
not
my
martha
whispered
landlord
martha
being
his
who
lived
in
the
loft
overhead
we
went
to
the
door
and
the
wind
burst
it
open
so
that
the
handle
was
driven
clean
into
the
plaster
of
the
wall
but
we
did
think
about
that
at
the
time
for
over
our
heads
sailing
very
comfortably
through
the
windy
stars
was
the
ship
that
had
passed
the
summer
in
field
her
and
her
were
blazing
with
lights
and
there
was
a
noise
of
singing
and
fiddling
on
her
decks
he
gone
shouted
landlord
above
the
storm
and
he
taken
half
the
village
with
him
i
could
only
nod
in
answer
not
having
lungs
like
bellows
of
leather
in
the
morning
we
were
able
to
measure
the
strength
of
the
storm
and
over
and
above
my
pigsty
there
was
damage
enough
wrought
in
the
village
to
keep
us
busy
true
it
is
that
the
children
had
to
break
down
no
branches
for
the
firing
that
autumn
since
the
wind
had
strewn
the
woods
with
more
than
they
could
carry
away
many
of
our
ghosts
were
scattered
abroad
but
this
time
very
few
came
back
all
the
young
men
having
sailed
with
captain
and
not
only
ghosts
for
a
poor
lad
was
missing
and
we
reckoned
that
he
had
stowed
himself
away
or
perhaps
shipped
as
not
knowing
any
better
what
with
the
lamentations
of
the
ghost
girls
and
the
grumblings
of
families
who
had
lost
ancestors
the
village
was
upset
for
a
while
and
the
funny
thing
was
that
it
was
the
folk
who
had
complained
most
of
the
of
the
youngsters
who
made
most
noise
now
that
they
were
gone
i
had
any
sympathy
with
shoemaker
or
butcher
who
ran
about
saying
how
much
they
missed
their
lads
but
it
made
me
grieve
to
hear
the
poor
bereaved
girls
calling
their
lovers
by
name
on
the
village
green
at
nightfall
it
did
seem
fair
to
me
that
they
should
have
lost
their
men
a
second
time
after
giving
up
life
in
order
to
join
them
as
like
as
not
still
not
even
a
spirit
can
be
sorry
forever
and
after
a
few
months
we
made
up
our
mind
that
the
folk
who
had
sailed
in
the
ship
were
never
coming
back
and
we
did
talk
about
it
any
more
and
then
one
day
i
dare
say
it
would
be
a
couple
of
years
after
when
the
whole
business
was
quite
forgotten
who
should
come
trapesing
along
the
road
from
portsmouth
but
the
daft
lad
who
had
gone
away
with
the
ship
without
waiting
till
he
was
dead
to
become
a
ghost
you
never
saw
such
a
boy
as
that
in
all
your
life
he
had
a
great
rusty
cutlass
hanging
to
a
string
at
his
waist
and
he
was
tattooed
all
over
in
fine
colors
so
that
even
his
face
looked
like
a
girl
sampler
he
had
a
handkerchief
in
his
hand
full
of
foreign
shells
and
pieces
of
small
money
very
curious
and
he
walked
up
to
the
well
outside
his
mother
house
and
drew
himself
a
drink
as
if
he
had
been
nowhere
in
particular
the
worst
of
it
was
that
he
had
come
back
as
as
he
went
and
try
as
we
might
we
could
get
anything
reasonable
out
of
him
he
talked
a
lot
of
gibberish
about
keelhauling
and
walking
the
plank
and
crimson
murders
things
which
a
decent
sailor
should
know
nothing
about
so
that
it
seemed
to
me
that
for
all
his
manners
captain
had
been
more
of
a
pirate
than
a
gentleman
mariner
but
to
draw
sense
out
of
that
boy
was
as
hard
as
picking
cherries
off
a
one
silly
tale
he
had
that
he
kept
on
drifting
back
to
and
to
hear
him
you
would
have
thought
that
it
was
the
only
thing
that
happened
to
him
in
his
life
we
was
at
anchor
he
would
say
off
an
island
called
the
basket
of
flowers
and
the
sailors
had
caught
a
lot
of
parrots
and
we
were
teaching
them
to
swear
up
and
down
the
decks
up
and
down
the
decks
and
the
language
they
used
was
dreadful
then
we
looked
up
and
saw
the
masts
of
the
spanish
ship
outside
the
harbor
outside
the
harbor
they
were
so
we
threw
the
parrots
into
the
sea
and
sailed
out
to
fight
and
all
the
parrots
were
drowneded
in
the
sea
and
the
language
they
used
was
dreadful
that
the
sort
of
boy
he
was
nothing
but
silly
talk
of
parrots
when
we
asked
him
about
the
fighting
and
we
never
had
a
chance
of
teaching
him
better
for
two
days
after
he
ran
away
again
and
has
been
seen
since
that
my
story
and
i
assure
you
that
things
like
that
are
happening
at
fairfield
all
the
time
the
ship
has
never
come
back
but
somehow
as
people
grow
older
they
seem
to
think
that
one
of
these
windy
nights
she
come
sailing
in
over
the
hedges
with
all
the
lost
ghosts
on
board
well
when
she
comes
she
be
welcome
there
one
ghost
lass
that
has
never
grown
tired
of
waiting
for
her
lad
to
return
every
night
you
see
her
out
on
the
green
straining
her
poor
eyes
with
looking
for
the
among
the
stars
a
faithful
lass
you
call
her
and
i
thinking
you
be
right
landlord
field
was
a
penny
the
worse
for
the
visit
but
they
do
say
that
since
then
the
turnips
that
have
been
grown
in
it
have
tasted
of
rum
the
transplanted
ghost
a
christmas
story
by
wallace
irwin
from
by
permission
of
and
wallace
irwin
the
transplanted
ghost
a
christmas
story
by
wallace
irwin
when
aunt
elizabeth
asked
me
to
spend
christmas
with
her
at
seven
oaks
she
appended
a
peculiar
request
to
her
letter
like
a
good
fellow
she
wrote
wo
you
drop
off
at
perkinsville
ohio
on
your
way
and
take
a
look
at
gauntmoor
castle
they
say
it
a
wonderful
old
pile
and
its
history
is
in
many
ways
connected
with
that
of
our
own
family
as
long
as
you
the
last
of
the
geoffray
pierreponts
such
things
ought
to
interest
you
like
her
auburn
namesake
who
bossed
the
thames
of
yore
sweet
romantic
autocrat
aunt
elizabeth
her
wishes
were
commands
what
the
deuce
is
aunt
elizabeth
up
to
now
i
asked
tim
cole
my
law
partner
whom
i
found
in
my
rooms
smoking
my
tobacco
why
should
i
be
inspecting
gauntmoor
castle
and
what
is
a
castle
named
gauntmoor
doing
in
perkinsville
ohio
anyway
perkinsville
sounds
like
the
middle
west
and
gauntmoor
sounds
like
the
middle
ages
right
in
both
analyses
said
the
tim
castle
gauntmoor
from
the
middle
ages
and
we
all
know
about
where
in
ohio
perkinsville
is
but
is
it
possible
that
you
years
old
and
a
college
graduate
have
heard
of
thaddeus
hobson
the
marvelous
millionaire
i
shook
my
head
the
papers
have
been
full
of
hobson
in
the
past
two
or
three
years
said
tim
it
was
in
i
think
that
fate
jumped
thaddeus
hobson
to
the
golden
olympus
he
was
first
head
salesman
in
the
village
hardware
store
then
he
formulated
so
successful
a
scheme
to
clean
up
the
tin
plate
combine
that
he
put
away
a
fabulous
number
of
millions
in
a
year
and
subsequently
went
to
england
finally
he
set
his
heart
on
norman
architecture
after
a
search
he
found
the
ancient
castle
gauntmoor
still
habitable
and
for
sale
he
thrilled
the
british
comic
papers
by
his
offer
to
buy
the
castle
and
move
it
to
america
hobson
saw
the
property
telegraphed
to
london
and
closed
the
deal
in
two
hours
and
an
army
of
laborers
at
once
began
taking
the
gauntmoor
to
pieces
stone
by
stone
transporting
that
relic
to
america
involved
a
cost
in
labor
and
ingenuity
comparable
with
nothing
that
has
yet
happened
moving
the
great
pyramid
would
be
a
lighter
job
perhaps
thousands
of
tons
of
scarred
and
medieval
granite
were
carried
to
the
railroads
freighted
to
the
sea
and
dragged
across
the
atlantic
in
whopping
big
lighters
chartered
for
the
job
and
the
next
the
newspapers
knew
the
monster
was
set
up
in
perkinsville
ohio
but
why
did
he
do
it
i
asked
who
knows
said
tim
ingrowing
sentiment
unlimited
capital
wanted
to
do
something
for
the
home
town
probably
wanted
to
beautify
the
village
that
gave
him
his
start
and
did
know
how
to
go
at
it
well
so
long
he
called
out
as
i
seized
my
hat
and
streaked
for
the
train
it
was
dinner
time
when
the
train
pulled
in
at
perkinsville
the
town
was
as
undistinguished
as
i
expected
i
was
too
hungry
to
care
about
castles
at
the
moment
so
i
took
the
for
the
commercial
hotel
an
establishment
that
seemed
to
live
up
to
its
name
both
in
sentiment
and
in
accommodation
the
landlord
spike
referred
bitterly
to
the
castle
which
he
explained
was
by
its
dominating
presence
the
prosperous
appearance
of
perkinsville
dinner
over
he
led
me
to
a
side
porch
how
does
perkinsville
look
with
that
with
that
curio
squattin
on
top
of
it
asked
spike
sternly
as
he
pointed
over
the
local
livery
stable
over
smith
brothers
plow
works
over
odd
fellows
hall
and
up
up
to
the
bleak
hills
beyond
where
poised
like
a
stony
coronet
on
a
giant
brow
rose
the
great
norman
towers
and
frowning
buttresses
of
gauntmoor
castle
i
rubbed
my
eyes
no
it
be
real
it
must
be
a
wizard
work
what
old
hobson
got
out
of
it
said
spike
in
my
ear
but
an
old
stone
barn
where
he
can
set
all
day
nursin
a
grouch
and
keepin
his
daughter
anita
they
do
say
he
does
under
lock
and
key
for
fear
somebody
goin
to
marry
her
for
her
money
spike
looked
up
at
the
ramparts
defiantly
even
as
the
saxon
churl
must
have
gazed
in
an
earlier
far
sadder
land
it
romantic
i
suggested
yes
rheumatic
agreed
spike
is
it
open
for
visitors
i
asked
innocently
hobson
cackled
spike
he
no
more
welcome
a
stranger
to
that
place
than
he
welcome
a
ghost
he
a
terror
hobson
spike
turned
away
to
referee
a
pool
game
down
in
the
barroom
the
fires
of
a
december
sunset
flared
behind
gauntmoor
and
cast
the
grim
shadows
of
medievalism
over
mediocrity
which
lay
below
presently
the
light
faded
and
i
grew
tired
of
gazing
since
hobson
would
permit
no
tourists
to
inspect
his
castle
why
was
i
here
on
this
foolish
trip
already
i
was
planning
to
wire
aunt
elizabeth
a
sarcastic
reference
to
being
marooned
at
christmas
with
a
castle
on
my
hands
when
a
voice
at
my
shoulder
said
suddenly
hobson
sends
his
compliments
sir
and
wants
to
know
would
pierrepont
come
up
to
gauntmoor
for
the
night
a
groom
in
a
livery
stood
at
my
elbow
a
light
station
wagon
was
waiting
just
outside
how
the
deuce
did
hobson
know
my
name
what
did
he
want
of
me
at
gauntmoor
this
time
of
night
yet
prospects
of
bed
and
breakfast
away
from
the
commercial
lured
me
strangely
sure
pierrepont
will
be
delighted
i
announced
leaping
into
the
vehicle
and
soon
we
were
mounting
upward
battling
with
the
winds
around
the
walls
the
wagon
stopped
at
the
great
gate
a
horn
sounded
from
within
the
gate
swung
open
a
drawbridge
fell
with
a
hideous
creaking
of
machinery
and
we
passed
in
twenty
or
thirty
feet
above
the
moat
beyond
the
portcullis
a
dim
door
swung
open
some
sort
of
seneschal
met
us
with
a
light
and
led
us
below
the
twilight
arches
where
beyond
i
could
catch
glimpses
of
the
baileys
and
courts
and
the
donjon
tower
against
the
heavy
ramparts
the
wind
hooted
through
the
high
galleries
as
we
passed
but
the
west
wing
from
its
many
windows
and
loopholes
blazed
with
cheerful
yellow
light
it
looked
nearly
cozy
into
a
tall
gaunt
tower
we
plunged
down
a
winding
staircase
and
suddenly
we
came
into
a
vast
hall
stately
with
tapestries
and
innumerable
monkish
carvings
and
all
brightly
lighted
with
electricity
a
little
fat
man
sat
smoking
in
a
chair
near
the
fire
when
i
entered
he
was
in
his
shirt
sleeves
reading
a
newspaper
but
when
a
footman
announced
my
name
the
little
man
in
a
state
of
great
nervousness
jumped
to
his
feet
and
threw
on
a
coat
fidgeting
painfully
with
the
armholes
as
he
came
toward
me
i
noticed
that
he
was
perfectly
bald
he
looked
dyspeptic
and
discontented
like
a
practical
man
trying
vainly
to
adjust
his
busy
habits
to
a
lazy
life
obviously
he
did
go
with
the
rest
of
the
furniture
pleased
to
see
you
pierrepont
he
said
looking
me
over
carefully
as
if
he
thought
of
buying
me
geoffray
pierrepont
tut
tut
ai
it
queer
queer
i
said
rather
peevishly
what
queer
about
it
excuse
me
did
i
say
queer
i
did
mean
to
be
impolite
sir
i
was
just
thinking
that
all
you
could
hear
the
demon
army
of
the
winds
scaling
the
walls
outside
maybe
you
thought
it
kind
of
abrupt
pierrepont
me
asking
you
up
here
so
unceremonious
he
said
my
daughter
annie
she
tells
me
i
ought
to
live
up
to
the
looks
of
the
place
but
i
got
my
notions
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
in
an
awful
quandary
about
this
antique
castle
business
and
when
i
heard
you
was
at
the
hotel
i
thought
you
might
help
me
out
some
way

you
he
led
me
to
a
chair
and
offered
me
a
fat
cigar
young
man
he
said
when
you
get
your
head
above
water
and
make
good
in
the
world
if
you
ever
do
do
fool
with
curios
do
monkey
with
antiques
keep
away
from
castles
they
like
everything
else
sold
by
curio
dealers
all
humbug
look
nice
yes
but
get
over
to
america
and
they
either
fall
to
pieces
or
the
paint
comes
off
whether
it
a
chair
or
a
castle
same
old
story
the
sly
scalawags
that
sell
you
the
goods
wo
live
up
to
their
contracts
has
gauntmoor
all
the
ancient
inconveniences
a
robber
baron
could
wish
i
asked
it
ai
announced
hobson
though
it
looks
all
right
to
a
stranger
perhaps
there
may
be
castles
in
the
old
world
got
it
on
gauntmoor
for
size
thank
god
i
did
buy
but
for
looks
you
beat
gauntmoor
comfortable
i
asked
ca
complain
modern
plumbed
throughout
hard
to
heat
but
i
put
an
plant
in
the
cellar
daughter
annie
got
a
colonial
suite
in
the
north
tower
well
i
suggested
if
there
anything
the
castle
lacks
you
can
buy
it
there
one
thing
money
buy
said
hobson
leaning
very
close
and
speaking
in
a
sibilant
whisper
and
that
ghosts
but
who
wants
ghosts
i
inquired
now
look
here
said
hobson
i
a
business
man
when
i
bought
gauntmoor
the
london
scalawags
that
sold
it
to
me
gave
me
distinctly
to
understand
that
this
was
a
haunted
castle
they
showed
me
a
haunted
chamber
showed
me
the
haunted
wall
where
the
ghost
walks
guaranteed
the
place
to
be
the
spook
headquarters
of
the
british
isles
and
see
what
i
got
he
snapped
his
fingers
in
disgust
no
results
results
stung
i
slept
in
that
haunted
room
upstairs
for
a
solid
year
i
gazed
night
after
night
over
the
haunted
rampart
i
even
hired
spiritualists
to
come
and
cut
their
didoes
in
the
towers
and
donjon
keep
no
use
you
ca
get
ghosts
where
they
ai
i
expressed
my
sympathy
i
a
plain
man
said
hobson
i
ai
got
any
ancestors
back
of
father
who
was
a
blacksmith
and
a
good
one
when
sober
somebody
else
ancestors
is
what
i
looked
for
in
this
place
and
i
got
too
carved
in
wood
and
stone
in
the
chapel
out
back
of
the
tower
but
statues
and
carvings
ai
like
ghosts
to
add
tone
to
an
ancient
lineage
is
there
any
legend
i
asked
have
you
heard
it
he
exclaimed
looking
at
me
sharply
out
of
his
small
gray
eyes
it
seems
back
in
the
sixteenth
century
there
was
a
young
feller
living
in
a
neighboring
castle
and
he
took
an
awful
shine
to
lady
katherine
daughter
of
the
earl
of
cummyngs
who
was
boss
of
this
place
at
that
time
now
the
young
man
who
loved
miss
i
mean
lady
katherine
was
a
sort
of
wild
proposition
old
man
would
have
him
around
the
place
but
young
man
kept
hanging
on
till
earl
ordered
him
off
finally
the
old
gent
locked
lady
kitty
in
the
donjon
tower
said
hobson
too
much
in
generation
he
went
on
every
house
that
got
a
pretty
girl
ought
to
have
a
donjon
keep
i
got
both
he
paused
and
wiped
his
brow
this
fresh
young
kid
i
telling
you
about
he
thought
he
knew
more
than
the
old
folks
so
he
got
a
rope
ladder
and
climbed
up
the
masonry
one
night
intending
to
bust
into
the
tower
where
the
girl
was
but
just
as
he
got
half
across
the
wall
out
yonder
his
foot
slipped
and
he
broke
his
neck
in
the
moat
below
consequence
lady
kitty
goes
crazy
and
old
earl
found
dead
a
week
later
in
his
room
it
was
christmas
eve
when
the
boy
was
killed
that
the
night
his
ghost
supposed
to
walk
along
the
ramparts
give
a
shriek
and
drop
off
but
the
irritating
thing
about
it
all
is
it
do
ever
happen
and
now
hobson
i
said
throwing
away
the
butt
of
my
cigar
why
am
here
what
have
got
to
do
with
all
this
ghost
business
i
you
to
stay
said
hobson
beseechingly
christmas
eve
i
figured
it
out
that
your
influence
somehow
you
being
of
the
same
blood
as
it
were
might
encourage
the
ghost
to
come
out
and
save
the
reputation
of
the
castle
a
servant
brought
candles
and
hobson
turned
to
retire
the
same
blood
i
shouted
after
him
what
on
earth
is
the
of
the
ghost
when
he
was
alive
his
name
was
sir
geoffray
de
pierrepont
said
thaddeus
hobson
his
figure
fading
into
the
dimness
beyond
i
followed
the
servant
with
the
candle
aloft
through
chill
and
carven
corridors
through
galleries
lined
with
faded
portraits
of
forgotten
lords
wheels
i
kept
saying
to
myself
the
old
man
evidently
thinks
it
takes
a
live
pierrepont
to
coax
a
dead
one
and
i
laughed
nervously
as
i
entered
the
vast
brown
bedroom
i
had
to
get
on
a
chair
in
order
to
climb
into
the
a
cheerful
affair
that
looked
like
a
royal
funeral
barge
at
my
head
i
noticed
a
carved
device
seven
mailed
hands
snatching
at
a
sword
with
the
motto
cave
adsum
beware
i
am
here
i
translated
who
was
here
ghosts
fudge
what
hideous
scenes
had
this
chamber
beheld
of
yore
what
might
not
happen
here
now
where
by
the
way
was
old
hobson
daughter
anita
might
not
anything
be
possible
i
covered
my
head
with
the
bedclothes
next
morning
being
mild
and
bright
for
december
and
thaddeus
hobson
and
his
mysterious
daughter
not
having
showed
up
for
breakfast
i
amused
myself
by
inspecting
the
exterior
of
the
castle
in
daylight
i
could
see
that
gauntmoor
as
now
restored
consisted
of
only
a
portion
of
the
original
structure
on
the
west
side
near
a
sheer
fall
of
forty
or
fifty
feet
stood
the
donjon
tower
a
fine
piece
of
medieval
barbarism
with
a
peaked
roof
and
sure
enough
i
saw
it
all
now
running
along
the
entire
west
side
of
the
castle
was
a
wonderful
wall
stretching
above
the
moat
to
a
dizzy
height
it
was
no
difficult
matter
to
mount
this
wall
from
the
courtyard
above
which
it
rose
no
more
than
eight
or
ten
feet
i
ascended
by
a
rude
sentry
staircase
and
once
on
top
i
gazed
upward
at
the
tall
medieval
which
reared
above
me
like
a
clumsy
stone
chimney
just
as
i
stood
at
the
top
of
the
wall
i
was
ten
or
twelve
feet
below
the
lowest
window
of
the
donjon
tower
this
then
was
the
wall
that
the
ancient
pierrepont
had
scaled
and
yonder
was
the
donjon
window
that
he
had
planned
to
plunder
on
that
fatal
night
so
long
ago
and
this
was
where
pierrepont
the
ghost
was
supposed
to
appear
how
the
lover
of
spectral
memory
had
managed
to
scale
that
wall
from
the
outside
i
could
not
quite
make
out
but
once
the
wall
it
was
no
trick
to
snatch
the
damsel
from
her
durance
vile
just
drop
a
long
rope
ladder
from
the
wall
to
the
moat
then
crawl
along
the
narrow
ledge
got
to
be
careful
with
a
job
like
that
then
up
to
the
window
of
the
donjon
keep
and
away
with
the
lady
fair
why
that
window
above
the
ramparts
would
be
an
easy
climb
for
a
fellow
with
strong
arms
and
a
little
nerve
as
the
face
of
the
tower
from
the
wall
to
the
window
was
studded
with
ancient
spikes
and
the
projecting
ends
of
beams
i
counted
the
feet
one
two
three
and
as
i
looked
up
at
the
window
a
small
white
hand
reached
out
and
a
pink
slip
of
paper
dropped
at
my
feet
it
read
dear
sir
i
miss
hobson
i
locked
in
the
donjon
tower
father
always
locks
me
here
when
there
a
young
man
about
it
a
horrid
uncomfortable
place
wo
you
hurry
and
go
yours
respectfully
hobson
i
knew
it
was
easy
i
swung
myself
aloft
on
the
spikes
and
stones
leading
to
the
donjon
window
when
i
was
high
enough
i
gazed
in
my
chin
about
even
with
the
sill
and
there
i
saw
the
prettiest
girl
i
ever
beheld
gazing
down
at
a
book
tranquilly
as
though
gentlemanly
rescuers
were
common
as
toads
around
that
tower
she
wore
something
soft
and
golden
her
hair
was
and
her
eyes
were
that
peculiar
shade
of
gray
that
but
what
the
use
pardon
i
said
holding
on
with
my
right
hand
lifting
my
hat
with
my
left
pardon
am
i
addressing
miss
annie
hobson
you
are
not
she
replied
only
half
looking
up
you
are
addressing
miss
anita
hobson
calling
me
annie
is
another
little
habit
father
ought
to
break
himself
of
she
went
on
reading
is
that
a
very
interesting
book
i
asked
because
i
did
like
to
go
without
saying
something
more
it
is
she
arose
suddenly
and
hurled
the
book
into
a
corner
anthony
hope
and
if
there
anything
i
hate
it
him
father
always
gives
me
of
and
to
read
when
he
locks
me
into
this
donjon
says
i
ought
to
read
up
on
the
situation
do
you
think
so
there
are
some
other
books
in
the
library
i
suggested
bernard
shaw
and
kipling
you
know
i
run
over
and
get
you
one
that
fine
but
no
she
besought
reaching
out
her
hand
to
detain
me
no
do
go
if
you
went
away
you
never
come
back
they
never
do
who
never
do
the
young
men
the
very
instant
father
sees
one
coming
he
pops
me
in
the
tower
and
turns
the
key
you
see
she
explained
when
i
was
in
italy
i
was
engaged
to
a
duke
he
was
a
silly
little
thing
and
i
was
glad
when
he
turned
out
bogus
but
father
took
the
deception
awfully
to
heart
and
swore
i
should
never
be
married
for
my
money
yet
i
do
see
what
else
a
young
girl
can
expect
she
added
quite
simply
i
could
have
mentioned
several
hundred
things
he
has
no
right
i
said
sternly
it
barbarous
for
him
to
treat
a
girl
that
way
especially
his
daughter
hush
she
said
dad
a
good
sort
but
you
ca
measure
him
by
other
people
standards
and
yet
oh
it
maddening
this
life
day
after
day
loneliness
nothing
but
stone
walls
and
rusty
armor
and
books
we
rich
but
what
do
we
get
out
of
it
i
have
nobody
of
my
own
age
to
talk
to
how
the
years
are
passing
after
a
while
i
be
an
old
maid
i
now
i
heard
a
sob
her
pretty
head
was
bowed
in
her
hands
desperately
i
seized
the
bars
of
the
window
and
miraculously
they
parted
i
leaned
across
the
sill
and
drew
her
hands
gently
down
listen
to
me
i
said
if
i
break
in
and
steal
you
away
from
this
will
you
go
go
she
said
where
my
aunt
lives
at
seven
oaks
less
than
an
hour
from
here
by
train
you
can
stay
there
till
your
father
comes
to
his
reason
it
quite
like
father
to
come
to
his
reason
she
reflected
then
i
should
have
to
be
of
course
i
should
appreciate
employment
in
a
candy
shop
i
think
i
know
all
the
principal
kinds
will
you
go
i
asked
yes
she
replied
simply
i
go
but
how
can
i
get
away
from
here
i
said
is
christmas
eve
when
pierrepont
the
ghost
is
supposed
to
walk
along
the
wall
right
under
this
window
you
believe
that
fairy
story
do
you
no
neither
do
i
but
ca
you
see
the
haunted
wall
begins
at
my
window
on
one
end
of
the
castle
and
ends
at
your
window
on
the
other
the
bars
of
your
cell
i
see
are
nearly
all
loose
yes
she
laughed
i
pried
them
out
with
a
pair
of
scissors
i
could
hear
hobson
voice
across
the
court
giving
orders
to
servants
your
father
coming
remember
i
whispered
midnight
she
said
softly
smiling
out
at
me
i
could
have
faced
flocks
and
flocks
of
dragons
for
her
at
that
moment
the
old
man
was
coming
nearer
i
swung
to
the
ground
and
escaped
into
a
ruined
court
well
the
hours
that
followed
were
anxious
and
busy
for
me
i
worked
in
the
glamour
of
romance
like
a
soldier
about
to
do
some
particularly
brave
and
foolish
thing
from
the
window
of
my
room
i
looked
down
on
the
narrow
giddy
wall
below
it
a
brave
and
foolish
thing
among
the
rubbish
in
an
old
armory
i
found
a
coil
of
stout
rope
forty
or
fifty
feet
of
it
this
i
smuggled
away
from
a
remote
hall
i
borrowed
a
crusader
helmet
and
spent
the
balance
of
the
afternoon
in
my
room
practicing
with
a
sheet
across
my
shoulders
we
dined
grandly
at
eight
the
old
man
and
i
he
drank
thirstily
and
chatted
about
the
ghost
as
you
might
discuss
the
chances
in
a
coming
athletic
event
after
what
seemed
an
age
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
cried
whillikens
eleven
already
well
i
be
going
up
to
watch
from
the
haunted
room
i
think
jeff
that
you
bring
me
luck
i
am
sure
i
shall
i
answered
sardonically
as
he
departed
three
quarters
of
an
hour
later
wearing
the
crusader
helmet
and
swathed
in
a
bedsheet
i
let
myself
down
from
the
window
to
the
haunted
wall
below
it
was
moonlight
bitter
cold
as
i
crouched
on
the
wall
waiting
for
the
stroke
of
twelve
when
i
should
act
the
spook
and
walk
along
that
precarious
ledge
to
rescue
anita
the
haunted
wall
i
observed
from
where
i
stood
was
shaped
like
an
irregular
crescent
being
in
plain
view
of
hobson
haunted
room
at
the
middle
but
not
so
at
its
north
and
south
ends
where
my
chamber
and
anita
tower
were
respectively
situated
i
pulled
out
my
watch
from
under
my
three
minutes
of
twelve
i
drew
down
the
vizor
of
my
helmet
and
gathered
up
my
cerements
preparatory
to
walking
the
hundred
feet
of
wall
which
would
bring
me
in
sight
of
the
haunted
room
where
old
hobson
kept
his
vigil
two
minutes
one
minute
i
waited
when
i
suddenly
realized
i
was
not
alone
a
man
wearing
a
long
cloak
and
a
feather
in
his
cap
was
coming
toward
me
along
the
moonlit
masonry
aha
so
i
was
not
the
only
masquerading
swain
calling
on
the
captive
princess
in
the
prison
tower
a
jealous
pang
shot
through
me
as
i
realized
this
the
man
was
within
twenty
feet
of
me
when
i
noticed
something
he
was
not
walking
on
the
wall
was
walking
on
air
three
or
four
feet
above
the
nearer
and
nearer
came
the
man
the
thing
now
into
the
light
of
the
moon
whose
beams
seemed
to
strike
through
his
misty
tissue
like
the
thrust
of
a
sword
i
was
horribly
scared
my
knees
loosened
under
me
and
i
clutched
the
vines
at
my
back
to
save
me
from
falling
into
the
moat
below
now
i
could
see
his
face
and
somehow
fear
seemed
to
leave
me
his
expression
was
so
young
and
human
ghost
of
the
pierrepont
i
thought
whether
you
walk
in
shadow
or
in
light
you
lived
among
a
race
of
men
his
noble
pallid
face
seemed
to
burn
with
its
own
pale
light
but
his
eyes
were
in
darkness
he
was
now
within
two
yards
of
me
i
could
see
the
dagger
at
his
belt
i
could
see
the
gory
cut
on
his
forehead
i
attempted
to
speak
but
my
voice
creaked
like
a
rusty
hinge
he
neither
heeded
nor
saw
me
and
when
he
came
to
the
spot
where
i
stood
he
did
not
turn
out
for
me
he
walked
me
and
when
next
i
saw
him
he
was
a
few
feet
beyond
me
standing
in
over
the
moat
and
gazing
up
at
the
high
towers
like
one
revisiting
old
scenes
again
he
floated
toward
me
and
poised
on
the
wall
four
feet
from
where
i
stood
what
do
you
here
suddenly
spoke
or
seemed
to
speak
a
voice
that
was
like
the
echo
of
a
silence
no
answer
came
from
my
frozen
tongue
yet
i
would
gladly
have
spoken
because
somehow
i
felt
a
great
sympathy
for
this
boyish
spirit
it
has
been
many
he
said
since
i
have
walked
these
towers
and
ah
cousin
it
has
been
many
miles
that
i
have
been
called
to
answer
the
summons
of
my
race
and
this
fortress
what
power
has
moved
it
overseas
to
this
mad
kingdom
magic
his
eyes
seemed
suddenly
to
blaze
through
the
shadows
cousin
he
again
spoke
it
is
to
you
that
i
come
from
my
english
tomb
it
was
your
need
called
me
it
is
no
pious
deed
brings
you
to
this
wall
you
are
planning
to
pillage
these
towers
unworthily
even
as
i
did
yesterday
death
was
my
portion
and
broken
hearts
to
the
father
i
wronged
and
the
girl
i
sought
but
it
is
the
father
wrongs
the
girl
here
i
heard
myself
saying
he
who
rules
these
towers
is
of
stern
mind
but
loving
heart
said
the
ghost
patience
by
the
star
that
redeems
the
world
love
should
not
be
won
by
stealth
but
by
love
he
raised
his
hands
toward
the
tower
his
countenance
radiant
with
an
undying
passion
called
to
me
and
died
he
said
and
her
little
ghost
comes
not
to
earth
again
for
any
winter
moon
or
any
summer
wind
but
you
you
come
often
my
voice
was
saying
no
said
the
ghost
only
on
christmas
eve
yule
is
the
tide
of
specters
for
then
the
thoughts
of
the
world
are
so
beautiful
that
they
enter
our
dreams
and
call
us
back
he
turned
to
go
and
a
boyish
friendly
smile
rested
a
moment
on
his
pale
face
farewell
sir
geoffray
de
pierrepont
he
called
to
me
into
the
misty
moonlight
the
ghost
floated
to
that
portion
of
the
wall
directly
opposite
the
haunted
room
from
where
i
stood
i
could
not
see
this
chamber
after
a
moment
i
shook
my
numb
senses
to
life
my
first
instinct
was
one
of
strong
human
curiosity
which
impelled
me
to
follow
far
enough
to
see
the
effect
of
the
apparition
on
old
hobson
who
must
be
watching
at
the
window
i
tiptoed
a
hundred
feet
along
the
wall
and
peered
around
a
turret
up
to
a
room
above
where
hobson
head
could
easily
be
seen
in
a
patch
of
light
the
ghost
at
that
moment
was
walking
just
below
and
the
effect
on
the
old
man
appalling
though
it
was
was
ludicrous
as
well
he
was
leaning
far
out
of
the
window
his
mouth
wide
open
and
the
entire
disk
of
his
fat
hairless
head
was
as
pallid
as
the
moon
itself
the
specter
who
was
now
rounding
the
curve
of
the
wall
near
the
tower
swerved
suddenly
and
as
suddenly
seemed
to
totter
headlong
into
the
abyss
below
as
he
dropped
a
wild
laugh
broke
through
the
frosty
air
it
was
from
the
ghost
it
came
from
above
yes
it
emanated
from
thaddeus
hobson
who
had
apparently
fallen
back
leaving
the
window
empty
lights
began
breaking
out
all
over
the
castle
in
another
moment
i
should
be
caught
in
my
foolish
disguise
with
the
courage
of
a
coward
i
turned
and
ran
full
tilt
along
the
dizzy
ledge
and
back
to
my
window
where
i
lost
no
seconds
scrambling
up
the
rope
that
led
to
my
room
with
all
possible
haste
i
threw
aside
my
sheet
and
helmet
and
started
downstairs
i
had
just
wrestled
with
a
ghost
i
would
now
have
it
out
with
the
old
man
the
castle
seemed
ablaze
below
i
saw
the
flash
of
a
light
skirt
in
the
picture
gallery
and
anita
pale
as
the
vision
i
had
so
lately
beheld
came
running
toward
me
father
saw
it
she
panted
he
had
some
sort
of
sinking
spell
better
now
is
it
awful
she
clung
to
me
sobbing
hysterically
before
i
realized
what
i
had
done
i
was
holding
her
close
in
my
arms
do
i
cried
it
was
a
good
ghost
he
had
a
finer
spirit
than
mine
he
came
for
you
dear
and
for
me
it
was
a
foolish
thing
we
planned
yes
but
i
wanted
i
wanted
to
go
she
sobbed
now
crying
frankly
on
my
shoulder
you
going
with
me
i
said
fiercely
raising
her
head
but
not
over
any
breakneck
wall
we
going
this
time
through
the
big
front
door
of
this
old
castle
american
fashion
and
there
be
an
automobile
waiting
outside
and
a
parson
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
we
found
thaddeus
hobson
alone
in
the
vast
hall
looking
blankly
at
the
fire
jeff
he
said
solemnly
you
sure
brought
me
luck
if
you
can
call
it
such
being
scared
into
a
human
icicle
shall
i
ever
get
the
cold
out
of
my
backbone
but
somehow
somehow
that
foggy
feller
outside
sort
of
changed
my
look
on
things
it
made
me
feel
toward
living
folks
ai
it
strange
hobson
i
said
i
think
the
ghost
has
made
us
see
things
differently
in
a
word
sir
i
have
a
confession
to
make
if
you
mind
and
i
told
him
briefly
of
my
accidental
meeting
with
anita
in
the
donjon
of
the
practical
joke
we
planned
of
our
sudden
meeting
with
the
ghost
on
the
ramparts
hobson
listened
his
face
growing
redder
and
redder
at
the
finish
of
my
story
he
suddenly
leaped
to
his
feet
and
brought
his
fist
down
on
the
table
with
a
bang
well
you
little
devils
he
said
admiringly
and
burst
into
loud
laughter
you
a
spunky
lad
jeff
and
there
ai
any
doubt
that
the
de
pierreponts
are
as
good
stuff
as
you
can
get
in
the
ancestry
business
the
christmas
supper
is
spread
in
the
banquet
hall
come
de
pierrepont
will
you
sup
with
the
old
earl
the
huge
oaken
banquet
hall
lined
with
rich
hangings
shrunk
us
to
dwarfs
by
its
vastness
golden
goblets
were
at
each
place
a
butler
dressed
in
antique
livery
threw
a
red
cloak
over
hobson
fat
shoulders
it
was
a
whim
of
the
old
man
as
we
took
our
places
i
noticed
the
table
was
set
for
four
whose
is
the
extra
place
i
asked
the
old
man
at
first
made
no
reply
at
last
he
turned
to
me
earnestly
and
said
do
you
believe
in
ghosts
no
i
replied
yet
how
else
can
i
explain
that
vision
i
saw
on
the
ramparts
is
the
fourth
place
for
him
anita
almost
whispered
the
old
man
nodded
mutely
and
raised
a
golden
goblet
to
the
transplanted
ghost
i
said
it
was
an
empty
goblet
that
i
touched
to
my
lips

he

puffs

the
fire
in

was
out
and
the
day
was
going
slowly
through

open
door
of
the
shop
and
the
narrow
windows
westward
to
the
mountains
in

advancing
shadow

broken

on

they
sat
puffing
their

and
listening
for
a
partner
in
business
i
want
a
truthful
man
but
for
a
companion
give
me
one
with
imagination
to
my
mind
imagination
is
the
spice
of
life
there
is
nothing
so
uninteresting
as
a
fact
for
when
you
know
it
that
is
the
end
of
it
when
life
becomes
nothing
but
facts
it
wo
be
worth
living
yet
in
a
few
years
the
race
will
have
no
imagination
left
it
is
being
educated
out
look
at
the
children
when
i
was
young
the
bogey
man
was
as
real
to
me
as
pa
and
nearly
as
much
to
be
feared
of
but
just
yesterday
i
was
lectured
for
merely
mentioning
him
to
my
neffy
so
with
ghosts
we
was
taught
to
believe
in
ghosts
the
same
as
we
was
in
adam
or
noar
nowadays
nobody
believes
in
them
it
is
unscientific
and
if
you
are
superstitious
you
are
considered
ignorant
and
laughed
at
ghosts
are
the
product
of
the
imagination
but
if
i
imagine
i
see
one
he
is
as
real
to
me
as
if
he
actually
exists
is
he
therefore
he
does
exist
that
logic
you
fellows
have
become
scientific
and
admits
only
what
you
see
and
feel
and
do
depend
on
your
imagination
for
anything
such
being
the
case
i
myself
admit
that
the
sperrits
no
longer
the
or
play
around
your
houses
i
admit
it
because
the
same
condition
exact
existed
in
harmony
when
i
was
there
and
because
of
what
was
told
me
by
robert
dinkle
about
two
years
after
he
died
and
because
of
what
occurred
between
me
and
him
and
the
rev
spiegelnail
harmony
was
a
highly
intellectual
town
about
the
last
man
there
with
any
imagination
or
interesting
ideas
excepting
me
of
course
was
robert
dinkle
yet
he
had
an
awful
reputation
and
when
he
died
it
was
generally
stated
privately
that
the
last
landmark
of
ignorance
and
superstition
had
been
providentially
removed
you
know
he
had
always
been
seeing
things
but
we
set
it
down
to
his
fondness
for
hard
cider
or
his
natural
prepensity
for
joshing
with
him
gone
there
was
no
one
left
to
report
the
doings
of
the
in
fact
so
widespread
was
the
light
of
reason
as
the
rev
spiegelnail
called
it
that
the
became
a
popular
place
for
moonlight
strolls
even
i
walked
through
it
frequent
on
my
way
home
from
miss
wheedle
with
whom
i
was
keeping
company
and
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
go
any
faster
there
or
to
look
back
over
my
shoulder
for
i
did
believe
in
such
foolishness
but
to
the
most
intellectual
there
comes
times
of
doubt
about
things
they
know
nothing
of
nor
understand
such
a
time
come
to
me
when
the
wind
was
more
mournfuller
than
usual
in
the
trees
and
the
clouds
scudded
along
overhead
casting
peculiar
shadders
my
imagination
got
the
best
of
my
intellect
i
hurried
i
looked
back
over
my
shoulder
i
shivered
kind
of
natural
i
see
nothing
in
the
yet
at
the
end
of
town
i
was
still
though
half
laughing
at
myself
it
was
so
quiet
not
a
light
burned
anywhere
and
the
square
seemed
lonelier
than
the
cemetery
and
the
store
was
so
deserted
so
ghostly
in
the
moonlight
that
i
just
could
keep
from
peering
around
at
it
then
from
the
empty
porch
from
the
empty
bench
empty
i
swear
for
i
could
see
plain
so
clear
was
the
night
from
absolute
nothing
come
as
pleasant
a
voice
as
ever
i
hear
hello
it
says
my
blood
turned
and
the
chills
waved
up
and
down
all
through
me
i
could
move
the
voice
came
again
so
natural
so
familiar
that
i
warmed
some
and
rubbed
my
eyes
and
stared
there
sitting
on
the
bench
in
his
favorite
place
was
the
late
robert
dinkle
gleaming
in
the
moonlight
the
front
door
showing
right
through
him
i
must
appear
pretty
distinct
he
says
in
a
way
ca
you
see
me
very
plain
see
him
plain
i
should
think
so
even
the
patches
on
his
coat
was
visible
and
only
for
the
building
behind
him
he
never
looked
more
natural
and
hearing
him
so
pleasant
set
me
thinking
this
says
i
is
the
sperrit
of
the
late
robert
dinkle
in
life
he
never
did
me
any
harm
and
in
his
present
misty
condition
is
likely
to
do
less
if
he
is
looking
for
trouble
i
not
afraid
of
a
bit
of
fog
such
being
the
case
i
says
i
shall
address
him
as
soon
as
i
am
able
but
robert
got
tired
waiting
and
spoke
again
in
an
anxious
tone
a
little
louder
and
ruther
complaining
do
i
show
up
good
says
he
i
never
see
you
looking
better
i
answered
for
my
voice
had
came
back
and
the
chills
were
quieter
and
i
was
fairly
ca
and
dared
even
to
move
a
little
nearer
a
bright
smile
showed
on
his
pale
face
it
is
a
relief
to
be
seen
at
last
he
cried
most
cheerful
for
years
i
been
trying
to
do
a
little
around
here
and
no
one
would
notice
me
i
used
to
think
mebbe
my
material
was
too
delicate
and
gauzy
but
i
conceded
that
after
all
the
stuff
is
not
to
blame
he
heaved
a
sigh
so
natural
that
i
forgot
all
about
his
being
a
ghost
indeed
taken
all
in
all
i
see
that
he
had
improved
was
solemner
had
a
sweeter
expression
and
was
likely
to
give
in
to
his
old
prepensity
for
joshing
set
down
and
we
will
talk
it
over
he
went
on
most
winning
really
i
ca
do
any
harm
but
please
be
a
little
afraid
and
then
i
will
show
up
distincter
i
must
be
getting
dim
now
you
are
says
i
for
though
i
was
on
the
porch
edging
nearer
him
most
bold
i
could
hardly
see
him
without
any
warning
he
gave
an
awful
groan
that
brought
the
chills
waving
back
most
violent
i
jumped
and
stared
and
as
i
stared
he
stood
out
plainer
and
solider
in
the
moonlight
that
better
he
said
with
a
jolly
chuckle
now
you
do
believe
in
me
do
you
well
set
there
on
the
edge
of
the
bench
and
do
be
too
or
i
disappear
the
ghost
orders
were
followed
explicit
but
with
him
setting
there
so
natural
and
pleasant
it
was
hard
to
be
frightened
and
more
than
once
i
forgot
he
seeing
me
peering
like
my
eyesight
was
bad
would
give
a
groan
that
made
my
blood
curdle
up
he
would
flare
again
gleaming
in
the
moonlight
full
and
strong
harmony
getting
too
scientific
too
intellectual
he
said
speaking
very
melancholic
what
ca
be
explained
by
arithmetic
or
geography
is
put
down
as
impossible
even
the
preachers
encourage
such
idees
and
talk
about
adam
and
eve
being
allegories
as
a
result
the
graveyard
has
become
the
slowest
place
in
town
you
simply
ca
anything
around
here
a
man
hears
a
groan
in
his
room
and
he
gets
up
and
closes
the
shutters
tighter
or
throws
a
shoe
at
a
rat
or
swears
at
the
wind
in
the
chimney
a
few
sperrits
were
hanging
around
when
i
was
first
dead
but
they
were
complaining
very
bad
about
the
hard
times
there
used
to
be
plenty
of
good
society
in
the
they
said
but
one
by
one
they
had
to
quit
all
the
old
berrys
had
left
whoople
retired
when
he
was
taken
for
a
white
mule
morris
klump
who
once
oppyrated
the
deserted
house
beyond
the
mill
had
gave
up
in
disgust
just
a
week
before
my
arrival
i
tried
to
encourage
the
few
remaining
explained
how
the
sperritualists
were
working
down
the
valley
and
would
strike
town
any
time
but
they
had
lost
all
hope
kept
fading
away
till
only
me
was
left
if
things
do
turn
for
the
better
soon
i
must
go
too
it
awful
discouraging
and
lonely
why
folks
ramble
around
the
graves
like
even
i
was
there
just
last
night
my
boy
ossy
came
strolling
along
with
the
lady
he
is
keeping
company
with
and
where
do
you
they
set
down
to
rest
and
look
at
the
moon
and
talk
about
the
silliest
subjecks
right
on
my
headstone
i
stood
in
front
of
them
and
did
the
ghostliest
things
till
i
was
clean
tired
out
and
discouraged
they
just
would
not
pay
the
least
attention
the
poor
old
ghost
almost
broke
down
and
cried
never
in
life
had
i
known
him
so
much
affected
and
it
went
right
to
my
heart
to
see
him
wiping
his
eyes
with
his
handkercher
and
snuffling
mebbe
you
do
make
enough
noise
when
you
says
i
most
sympathetic
i
do
all
the
regular
acts
says
he
a
bit
het
up
by
my
remark
we
always
were
kind
of
limited
i
float
around
and
groan
and
talk
foolish
and
sometimes
i
pull
off
bedclothes
or
reveal
the
of
buried
treasure
but
what
good
does
it
do
in
a
town
so
intellectual
as
harmony
i
have
seen
many
folks
who
were
down
on
their
luck
but
never
one
who
so
appealed
to
me
as
the
late
robert
dinkle
it
was
the
way
he
spoke
the
way
he
looked
his
general
patheticness
his
very
helplessness
and
deservingness
in
life
i
had
known
him
well
and
as
he
was
now
i
liked
him
better
so
i
did
want
to
do
something
for
him
we
sat
studying
for
a
long
time
him
smoking
very
violent
blowing
clouds
of
fog
outen
his
pipe
me
thinking
up
some
way
to
help
him
and
idees
allus
comes
to
them
who
sets
and
waits
the
trouble
is
partly
as
you
say
robert
i
allowed
after
a
bit
and
again
partly
because
you
ca
make
enough
noise
to
awaken
the
slumbering
imagination
of
intellectual
harmony
with
a
little
natural
help
from
me
though
you
might
stir
things
up
in
this
town
you
never
saw
a
gladder
smile
or
a
more
gratefuller
look
than
that
poor
sperrit
gave
me
ah
he
says
with
your
help
i
could
do
wonders
now
who
we
begin
on
the
rev
spiegelnail
says
i
has
about
all
the
imagination
left
in
harmony
of
course
excepting
me
robert
face
fell
visible
i
have
tried
him
repeated
and
often
he
says
kind
of
all
the
sign
he
made
was
to
complain
that
his
wife
talked
in
her
sleep
i
was
going
to
argue
not
me
i
was
all
for
action
and
lost
no
time
in
starting
robert
he
followed
me
like
a
dog
up
through
town
to
our
house
where
i
went
in
leaving
him
outside
so
as
not
to
disturb
mother
there
i
got
me
a
hammer
and
nails
with
the
heavy
lead
sinker
offen
my
fishnet
and
it
was
long
before
the
finest
you
ever
saw
was
working
against
the
spiegelnails
parlor
window
with
me
in
a
operating
the
string
that
kept
the
weight
before
the
house
was
an
open
spot
where
the
moon
shone
full
and
clear
where
robert
walked
up
and
down
about
two
feet
off
the
ground
waving
his
arms
and
making
the
melancholiest
groans
now
i
have
been
to
tom
frequent
but
in
all
my
life
i
never
see
such
acting
yet
what
was
the
consequences
up
went
the
window
above
and
the
rev
spiegelnail
showed
out
plain
in
the
moonlight
who
is
there
he
called
very
stern
you
had
otter
see
robert
then
it
was
like
tonic
to
him
he
rose
up
higher
and
began
to
beat
his
arms
most
violent
and
to
gurgle
tremendous
but
the
preacher
never
budged
you
boys
otter
be
ashamed
of
yourselves
he
says
in
a
severe
voice
louder
louder
i
calls
to
robert
in
answering
which
he
began
the
most
awful
contortions
you
can
hear
me
perfectly
plain
says
the
dominie
now
kind
of
it
fills
my
old
heart
with
sorrow
to
see
that
yous
all
have
gone
so
far
astray
hearing
that
so
calm
so
distinct
so
defiant
made
robert
stop
short
and
stare
to
remind
him
i
gave
the
weight
an
extra
thump
and
it
was
so
loud
as
to
bring
forth
spiegelnail
her
head
showing
plain
as
she
peered
out
over
the
preacher
shoulder
the
poor
discouraged
ghost
took
heart
striking
his
tragicest
attitude
one
which
he
told
me
afterwards
was
his
pride
and
had
been
got
out
of
a
book
but
what
was
the
result
does
you
hear
anyone
in
the
bushes
dear
inquires
spiegelnail
cocking
his
ears
and
listening
it
must
be
ossy
dinkle
and
them
bad
friends
of
his
says
she
in
her
sour
tone
poor
robert
hearing
that
he
about
gave
up
hope
do
i
show
up
good
he
asks
in
an
anxious
voice
i
can
see
you
distinct
says
i
very
sharp
you
never
looked
better
down
went
the
window
so
sudden
so
unexpected
that
i
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
robert
thought
he
did
and
over
me
he
came
floating
most
delighted
i
must
have
worked
he
said
laughing
like
he
die
up
and
holding
his
sides
to
keep
from
splitting
at
last
i
have
showed
up
distinct
at
last
i
am
of
some
use
in
the
world
you
do
realize
what
a
pleasure
it
is
to
know
that
you
are
fulfilling
your
mission
and
living
up
to
your
reputation
poor
old
ghost
he
was
for
talking
it
all
over
then
and
there
and
settled
down
on
a
soft
bunch
of
lilacs
and
fell
to
smoking
fog
and
chattering
it
did
me
good
to
see
him
so
happy
and
i
was
inclined
to
puff
up
a
bit
at
my
own
success
in
the
line
but
it
was
not
for
long
the
rattle
of
keys
warned
us
the
front
door
flew
open
and
out
bounded
the
rev
spiegelnail
clearing
the
steps
with
a
jump
and
flying
over
the
lawn
all
thought
of
the
late
robert
dinkle
left
me
then
for
i
had
only
a
few
feet
start
of
my
pastor
you
see
i
so
only
i
sung
bass
in
the
choir
and
i
doubt
if
i
could
have
convinced
him
that
i
was
working
in
the
interests
of
science
and
truth
fleeing
was
instinct
gates
did
matter
they
were
took
on
the
wing
and
down
the
street
i
went
with
the
preacher
hot
breath
on
my
neck
but
i
beat
him
he
tired
after
the
first
spurt
and
was
soon
left
behind
so
i
could
double
back
home
to
bed
robert
he
was
for
giving
up
entirely
i
simply
wo
work
says
he
to
me
when
i
met
him
on
the
store
porch
that
next
night
a
hundred
years
ago
such
a
bit
of
would
have
caused
the
town
to
be
abandoned
it
is
attributed
to
natural
causes
because
says
i
we
left
behind
such
evidences
of
material
manifestations
as
strings
and
weights
on
the
parlor
window
we
work
right
in
the
house
says
he
brightening
up
you
can
hide
in
the
closet
and
groan
while
i
act
now
did
you
ever
hear
anything
innocenter
than
that
yet
he
meant
it
so
well
i
did
not
even
laugh
i
too
fond
of
my
pastor
i
says
to
let
him
catch
me
in
his
closet
a
far
better
spot
for
our
work
is
the
short
cut
he
takes
home
from
church
after
wednesday
evening
meeting
we
wo
be
so
loud
but
more
dignified
melancholier
and
tragic
you
overacted
last
night
robert
i
says
next
time
pace
up
and
down
like
you
were
deep
in
thought
and
sigh
gentle
then
if
he
should
see
you
it
would
be
nice
to
take
his
arm
and
walk
home
with
him
i
think
i
had
the
right
idea
of
and
had
i
been
able
to
keep
up
robert
dinkle
sperrits
and
to
train
him
regular
i
could
have
aroused
the
slumbering
imagination
of
harmony
and
brought
life
to
the
but
he
was
too
easy
discouraged
he
lacked
perseverance
for
if
ever
spiegelnail
was
on
the
point
of
seeing
things
it
was
that
night
as
he
stepped
out
of
the
woods
he
had
walked
slow
and
meditating
till
he
come
opposite
where
i
was
now
i
did
howl
or
groan
or
say
anything
particular
what
i
did
was
to
make
a
noise
that
was
animal
neither
was
it
human
nor
was
it
regulation
ghostly
as
i
had
stated
to
the
late
robert
dinkle
what
was
needed
for
was
something
new
and
original
and
it
certainly
ketched
spiegelnail
attention
i
see
him
stop
i
see
his
lantern
shake
it
appeared
like
he
was
going
to
dive
into
the
bushes
for
me
but
he
changed
his
mind
on
he
went
quicker
kind
as
if
he
was
afraid
yet
was
on
to
the
open
where
the
moon
brought
out
robert
beautiful
as
he
paced
slowly
up
and
down
his
head
bowed
like
he
was
studying
still
the
preacher
never
saw
him
stepped
right
through
him
in
fact
i
give
the
dreadful
sound
again
that
stopped
him
he
turned
raised
the
lantern
before
him
put
his
hand
to
his
ear
and
seemed
to
be
looking
intense
and
listening
hardly
ten
feet
away
stood
robert
all
with
excitement
but
the
light
that
showed
through
him
was
as
steady
as
a
rock
as
the
dominie
watched
and
listened
so
quiet
and
ca
he
lowered
the
lantern
rubbed
his
hands
across
his
eyes
stepped
forward
and
looked
again
the
ghost
was
perfect
as
i
have
stated
he
was
excited
and
his
sigh
shook
a
little
but
he
was
full
of
dignity
and
sadity
he
should
have
lost
heart
so
soon
i
was
sure
then
that
he
almost
showed
up
plain
to
the
preacher
and
he
would
have
grown
on
spiegelnail
had
he
kept
on
him
instead
of
giving
in
because
that
one
night
the
pastor
walked
on
to
the
house
fairly
cool
he
did
walk
quicker
i
know
and
he
did
peer
over
his
shoulder
twicet
and
i
did
hear
the
kitchen
door
bang
in
a
relieved
way
but
when
we
consider
the
stuff
that
ghosts
are
made
of
we
had
otter
expect
them
to
be
heroes
they
are
too
foggy
and
gauzy
to
have
much
perseverance
judging
at
least
from
robert
j
i
simply
ca
work
any
more
says
he
when
i
came
up
to
him
as
he
sat
there
in
the
path
his
elbows
on
his
knees
his
head
on
his
hands
his
eyes
studying
the
ground
most
mournful
but
robert
i
began
thinking
to
cheer
him
up
he
did
hear
he
would
listen
just
faded
away
had
he
only
held
out
there
is
no
telling
what
he
might
have
done
in
his
line
often
since
then
have
i
thought
of
him
and
figgered
on
his
tremendous
possibilities
that
he
had
possibilities
i
am
sure
had
i
only
realized
it
that
last
night
we
went
out
he
never
would
have
got
away
from
me
but
the
realization
came
too
late
it
came
in
church
the
very
next
sunday
with
the
usual
announcements
after
the
long
prayer
as
spiegelnail
was
leaning
over
the
pulpit
eying
the
congregation
through
big
smoked
glasses
says
he
in
a
voice
that
was
full
of
sadness
i
regret
to
announce
that
for
the
first
time
in
twenty
years
union
services
will
be
held
in
this
town
next
sabbath
setting
in
the
choir
reading
my
music
marks
i
heard
the
preacher
words
and
started
for
i
saw
at
once
that
something
unusual
was
happening
or
had
happened
or
was
about
to
happen
unfortunately
said
spiegelnail
continuing
i
shall
have
to
turn
my
pulpit
over
to
brother
spiker
of
the
baptist
church
for
my
failing
eyesight
renders
it
necessary
that
i
go
at
once
to
philadelphia
to
consult
an
oculist
some
of
my
dear
brethren
may
think
this
an
unusual
step
but
i
should
not
desert
them
without
cause
they
may
think
perhaps
that
i
am
making
much
ado
about
nothing
and
could
be
treated
just
as
well
in
harrisburg
to
such
let
me
explain
that
i
am
suffering
from
astigmatism
it
is
not
so
much
that
i
can
not
see
but
that
i
sees
things
which
i
know
are
not
there
a
defect
in
sight
which
i
feel
needs
the
most
expert
attention
at
nine
divine
service
at
eleven
i
take
for
my
text
the
old
men
shall
see
visions
how
i
did
wish
the
late
robert
dinkle
could
have
been
in
church
that
morning
it
would
have
so
gladdened
his
heart
to
hear
that
he
had
partly
worked
for
if
he
worked
partly
then
surely
in
time
he
would
have
worked
complete
for
me
i
was
just
wild
with
excitement
and
was
so
busy
thinking
of
him
and
how
glad
he
would
be
that
i
did
hear
the
sermon
at
all
and
in
planning
new
ways
of
i
forgot
to
sing
in
the
last
anthem
you
see
i
figgered
lively
times
ahead
for
harmony
a
general
return
to
the
good
old
times
when
folks
had
imagination
and
had
something
more
in
their
heads
than
facts
i
had
only
to
get
robert
again
and
with
him
working
it
would
not
be
long
till
all
the
old
berrys
and
klump
showed
up
distinct
and
plain
but
i
was
well
posted
in
the
weak
characters
of
shades
for
i
thought
of
course
i
could
find
my
sperrit
friend
easy
when
night
came
yet
i
did
i
set
on
the
store
porch
shivering
till
the
moon
was
high
up
over
the
ridge
he
just
would
come
i
called
for
him
and
got
no
answer
down
to
the
i
went
and
set
on
his
headstone
it
was
the
quietest
place
you
ever
see
the
clouds
was
scudding
overhead
the
wind
was
sighing
among
the
leaves
and
through
the
trees
the
moon
was
gleaming
so
clear
and
distinct
you
could
almost
read
the
monnyments
it
was
just
a
night
when
things
should
have
been
lively
there
a
perfect
night
for
i
called
for
robert
i
listened
he
never
answered
i
heard
only
a
in
the
pond
a
whistling
in
the
grove
and
a
dog
howling
at
the
moon
the
ghost
of
miser
brimpson
by
eden
phillpotts
from
of
the
by
eden
phillpotts
published
in
america
by
john
lane
company
and
in
england
by
john
murray
by
permission
of
the
publishers
and
eden
phillpotts
the
ghost
of
miser
brimpson
by
eden
phillpotts
i
penniless
and
proud
he
was
and
that
pair
do
draw
a
man
to
pleasant
places
when
they
be
in
double
harness
there
only
one
thing
can
stop
if
they
take
the
bit
between
their
teeth
and
that
a
woman
so
there
you
might
say
lies
the
text
of
the
tale
of
jonathan
drake
of
dunnabridge
farm
a
tenement
in
the
forest
of
dartymoor
was
vineyard
to
duchy
and
the
greedy
thing
would
have
given
a
very
fair
price
for
it
without
a
doubt
but
the
drake
folk
held
their
land
and
would
part
with
it
and
boasted
a
freehold
of
fifty
acres
in
the
very
midst
of
the
forest
they
did
well
too
and
moved
with
the
times
and
kept
their
heads
high
for
more
generations
than
i
can
call
home
and
then
they
comed
to
what
all
families
whether
gentle
or
simple
always
come
to
soon
or
late
and
that
a
black
sheep
for
bad
uns
there
be
in
every
generation
of
a
race
but
the
trouble
begins
when
a
bad
un
chances
to
be
up
top
and
if
the
head
of
the
family
is
a
drunkard
or
a
spendthrift
or
built
on
too
free
and
flowing
a
pattern
for
this
shop
then
the
next
generation
may
look
out
for
squalls
as
the
say
was
jonathan
grandfather
that
did
the
harm
at
dunnabridge
he
had
sport
in
his
blood
on
his
mother
side
and
was
horses
ran
him
into
trouble
he
backed
and
was
ruined
and
then
his
son
bred
and
did
do
very
much
better
so
when
the
pair
of
dropped
out
of
the
hunt
and
died
with
their
backs
to
the
wall
one
after
it
looked
as
if
the
game
was
up
for
them
to
follow
by
good
chance
however
tom
drake
had
but
one
child
a
boy
the
jonathan
as
i
be
telling
about
and
when
his
father
and
grandfather
passed
away
within
a
year
of
each
other
dunnabridge
was
left
to
tom
widow
and
her
son
him
then
being
she
was
for
selling
dunnabridge
and
getting
away
from
dartymoor
because
the
place
had
used
her
bad
and
she
hated
the
sight
of
it
but
jonathan
a
proud
chap
even
then
got
the
lawyers
to
look
into
the
matter
and
they
told
him
that
was
vital
for
dunnabridge
to
be
sold
though
it
might
ease
his
pocket
and
smooth
his
future
to
do
so
as
duchy
wanted
the
place
rather
bad
and
had
offered
the
value
of
it
and
jonathan
mother
was
on
the
side
of
duchy
too
and
went
on
her
knees
to
the
man
to
sell
but
he
would
he
had
a
bee
in
his
bonnet
sometimes
and
he
said
that
all
the
drakes
would
rise
out
of
their
graves
to
widecombe
churchyard
and
haunt
his
rising
up
and
going
down
if
he
were
to
do
such
a
thing
just
to
suit
his
own
convenience
and
be
rid
of
the
place
so
he
made
a
plan
with
the
creditors
it
figured
out
that
his
father
and
grandfather
had
owed
near
a
thousand
pound
between
them
and
jonathan
actually
set
himself
to
pay
it
off
to
the
last
penny
was
the
labor
of
years
but
by
the
time
he
was
he
done
it
at
what
cost
of
scrimping
and
screwing
only
his
mother
might
have
told
she
never
did
tell
however
for
she
died
two
year
before
the
last
item
was
paid
some
went
as
far
as
to
declare
that
was
her
son
miserly
ways
hurried
her
into
her
grave
and
for
all
i
know
they
may
have
done
so
for
is
certain
in
her
husband
life
she
had
a
better
time
tom
was
the
juicy
easy
sort
as
liked
meat
on
the
table
and
plenty
to
wash
it
down
and
he
loved
mercy
jane
drake
very
well
and
when
he
died
the
only
thought
that
troubled
him
was
leaving
her
and
the
last
thing
he
advised
his
son
was
to
sell
dunnabridge
and
take
his
mother
off
the
moor
down
to
the
in
country
where
she
come
from
but
jonathan
was
made
of
different
stuff
and
was
rumored
by
old
people
that
had
known
the
family
for
several
generations
that
he
favored
an
ancient
forefather
by
name
of
brimpson
drake
this
bygone
man
was
a
miser
and
the
richest
of
the
race
he
lived
in
the
days
when
we
were
at
war
with
france
and
america
and
when
princetown
sprang
up
and
a
gert
was
built
there
to
cage
all
the
chaps
we
got
on
our
hands
through
winning
such
a
lot
o
sea
battles
and
miser
brimpson
was
said
to
have
made
thousands
by
helping
rich
fellows
to
escape
from
the
prison
truth
and
falsehood
mixed
made
up
his
story
as
was
handed
down
but
one
thing
appeared
to
be
fairly
true
about
it
which
was
that
when
the
miser
died
and
dunnabridge
went
to
his
cousin
the
horseracer
not
a
penny
of
his
fortune
ever
came
into
the
sight
of
living
men
so
some
said
was
all
nonsense
and
he
never
had
no
money
at
all
but
only
pretended
to
it
and
others
again
declared
that
he
knew
too
well
follow
in
his
shoes
at
dunnabridge
and
hid
his
money
accordingly
so
that
no
drake
should
have
it
for
he
hated
his
heirs
as
only
a
miser
can
hate
so
things
stood
when
mercy
jane
died
and
jonathan
was
left
alone
he
paid
all
his
relations
debts
and
he
had
his
trouble
and
the
honor
of
being
honorable
for
his
pains
everybody
respected
him
something
wonderful
but
all
the
same
a
few
of
his
mother
friends
always
did
say
that
was
a
pity
he
put
his
dead
father
good
name
afore
his
living
mother
life
however
we
not
built
in
the
pattern
of
our
and
is
only
fools
that
waste
time
blaming
a
man
for
being
himself
jonathan
went
his
stern
way
and
then
in
the
lonely
days
after
his
parent
was
taken
when
he
lived
at
dunnabridge
with
nought
but
two
hinds
and
a
brace
of
was
suddenly
borne
in
upon
his
narrow
sight
that
there
might
be
other
women
still
in
the
world
though
his
mother
had
gone
out
of
it
and
he
also
discovered
doubtless
that
a
home
without
a
woman
therein
be
merely
the
cruel
mockery
of
what
a
home
should
be
a
good
few
folk
watched
jonathan
to
see
what
he
do
about
it
and
no
doubt
a
maiden
here
and
there
was
interested
too
because
though
a
terrible
poor
man
he
was
bad
to
look
at
though
rather
hard
about
the
edge
of
the
jaw
and
rather
short
and
stern
in
his
manners
to
human
creatures
and
beasts
alike
and
then
beginned
his
funny
courting
if
you
can
call
it
courting
where
a
poor
man
allows
hisself
the
luxury
of
pride
at
the
wrong
time
and
makes
a
show
of
hisself
in
consequence
at
least
that
my
view
but
you
must
know
that
a
good
few
quite
as
wise
as
me
took
side
and
held
that
jonathan
covered
his
name
with
glory
when
he
changed
his
mind
about
hyssop
burges
that
was
her
bitter
name
but
a
pleasanter
girl
never
walked
on
she
was
farmer
stonewer
niece
to
white
works
and
he
took
her
in
for
a
charity
and
always
said
that
was
the
best
day
work
as
ever
he
had
done
a
straight
hardworking
cheerful
sort
of
a
girl
with
nothing
to
name
about
her
very
special
save
a
fine
shape
and
a
proud
way
of
holding
her
head
in
the
air
and
looking
her
fellow
creatures
in
the
eyes
proud
she
was
for
certain
and
terrible
partickler
as
to
her
friends
but
there
happened
to
be
that
about
jonathan
that
made
flint
to
her
steel
he
knowed
she
was
penniless
or
he
not
have
looked
at
her
twice
and
when
after
a
short
fierce
sort
of
courting
she
took
him
everybody
felt
pleased
about
it
but
farmer
stonewer
who
could
abide
the
thought
of
losing
hyssop
though
his
wife
had
warned
him
any
time
this
four
year
that
was
bound
to
happen
farmer
and
the
girl
were
sitting
waiting
for
jonathan
one
night
and
she
was
a
bit
nervous
and
he
was
trying
for
to
calm
her
jonathan
must
be
told
she
says
it
ca
go
on
no
longer
then
tell
him
says
her
uncle
good
powers
he
says
to
see
you
one
would
think
the
news
was
the
worst
as
could
ever
fall
between
a
pair
o
poor
lovers
instead
of
the
best
i
know
him
a
lot
better
than
you
she
tells
farmer
and
i
know
how
plaguey
difficult
he
can
be
where
money
the
matter
he
very
near
throwed
me
over
when
in
a
weak
moment
i
axed
him
to
let
me
buy
my
own
red
as
a
turkey
wattles
did
he
flame
and
said
insulted
him
and
now
when
he
hears
the
secret
i
ca
for
the
life
of
me
guess
how
he
take
it
was
a
pity
you
did
tell
him
when
he
offered
for
you
declared
hyssop
aunt
proud
he
is
as
a
silly
peacock
and
terrible
frightened
of
seeming
to
look
after
money
or
even
casting
his
eye
where
it
bides
but
he
came
to
you
without
any
notion
of
the
windfall
and
he
loved
you
for
yourself
like
an
honest
man
and
you
loved
him
the
same
way
and
right
well
you
know
that
if
your
old
cousin
had
left
you
five
thousand
pound
instead
of
five
hundred
jonathan
drake
was
the
right
chap
for
you
he
ca
blame
himself
for
not
a
soul
on
dartymoor
but
us
three
has
ever
heard
tell
about
the
money
but
he
blame
me
for
having
money
at
all
answered
the
girl
he
said
a
dozen
times
afore
he
offered
for
me
that
he
never
look
at
a
woman
if
she
got
more
cash
than
what
he
had
himself
that
why
i
could
bring
myself
to
confess
to
it
and
lose
him
and
after
we
was
tokened
it
got
to
be
harder
still
why
not
bide
till
you
married
then
asked
stonewer
since
it
have
gone
so
long
let
it
go
longer
and
surprise
him
with
the
news
on
the
eh
james
no
answered
farmer
is
as
good
as
a
feast
is
squandering
blessings
to
do
that
at
such
a
time
keep
the
news
till
some
rainy
day
when
he
wondering
how
to
get
round
a
tight
corner
that
the
moment
to
tell
him
and
that
the
moment
he
least
likely
to
make
a
face
at
the
news
but
hyssop
would
put
it
off
no
more
she
said
as
she
not
have
any
further
peace
till
the
murder
was
out
and
that
very
night
sure
enough
when
jonathan
comed
over
from
dunnabridge
for
his
bit
of
and
the
young
couple
had
got
the
farm
parlor
to
themselves
she
plumped
it
out
finding
him
in
a
very
kindly
mood
they
never
cuddled
much
for
he
was
built
that
way
but
he
not
disdain
to
sit
beside
her
and
put
his
arm
around
her
now
and
again
when
she
picked
up
his
hand
and
drew
it
round
then
off
and
on
she
rub
her
cheek
against
his
whiskers
till
he
had
to
kiss
her
in
common
politeness
well
hyssop
got
it
out
lord
alone
knows
how
as
she
said
afterwards
she
got
it
out
and
told
him
that
an
old
aged
cousin
had
died
and
left
her
a
nice
little
skuat
of
money
and
how
she
never
touched
a
penny
but
let
it
goody
in
the
bank
and
how
she
prayed
and
hoped
help
to
dunnabridge
and
how
of
course
he
must
have
the
handling
of
it
being
a
man
and
so
cruel
clever
in
such
things
she
went
on
and
on
pretty
well
frightened
to
stop
and
hear
him
but
after
she
said
it
over
about
a
dozen
times
her
breath
failed
her
and
she
shut
her
mouth
and
tried
to
smile
and
looked
up
terrible
anxious
and
pleading
at
jonathan
his
hard
gray
eyes
bored
into
her
like
a
brace
of
gimlets
and
in
return
for
all
her
talk
he
axed
but
one
question
how
long
have
you
had
this
here
money
he
said
she
told
the
truth
faltering
and
shaking
under
his
glare
four
years
and
upwards
jonathan
that
years
and
years
afore
i
axed
you
to
marry
me
yes
jonathan
and
you
remember
what
i
said
about
never
marrying
anybody
as
had
more
than
what
i
have
yes
jonathan
and
you
full
know
how
many
a
time
i
told
you
that
after
i
paid
off
all
my
father
debts
i
had
nought
left
and
be
years
afore
i
could
build
up
anything
to
call
money
yes
jonathan
very
well
then
he
cried
out
and
his
brow
crooked
down
and
his
fists
clenched
very
well
you
deceived
me
deliberate
and
if
you
do
that
in
one
thing
you
would
in
another
i
going
out
of
this
house
this
instant
moment
and
you
can
tell
your
relations
why
is
terrible
sorry
hyssop
burges
for
no
man
will
ever
love
you
better
than
what
i
did
and
so
you
have
lived
to
find
out
when
all
this
here
courting
tomfoolery
was
over
and
you
come
to
be
my
wife
but
now
have
none
of
you
for
you
played
with
me
and
so
so
i
bid
you
he
went
straight
out
without
more
speech
and
she
tottered
weeping
to
her
uncle
and
aunt
they
could
believe
their
senses
and
jimmy
stonewer
declared
thereon
that
any
man
who
could
make
himself
such
a
masterpiece
of
a
fool
as
jonathan
had
done
that
night
was
better
out
of
the
marriage
state
than
in
it
he
told
hyssop
as
she
had
a
marvelous
escape
from
a
prize
zany
and
his
wife
said
the
same
but
the
girl
could
see
it
like
that
she
knowed
jonathan
were
a
prize
zany
and
his
raging
pride
did
anger
her
for
she
admired
it
something
wonderful
and
it
only
made
her
feel
her
loss
all
the
crueller
to
see
what
a
terrible
rare
haughty
sort
of
a
chap
he
was
there
were
a
lot
of
other
men
would
have
had
her
and
twice
as
many
again
if
they
known
about
the
money
but
they
all
seemed
as
tame
as
robins
beside
her
hawk
of
a
jonathan
she
had
plenty
of
devil
in
her
too
when
it
came
to
the
fighting
pitch
and
now
while
he
merely
said
that
the
match
was
broken
off
through
a
difference
of
opinion
and
gave
no
reason
for
it
she
set
to
work
with
all
her
might
to
get
him
back
again
and
used
her
wits
so
well
as
she
knew
how
to
best
him
into
matrimony
ii
in
truth
she
made
poor
speed
jonathan
was
always
civil
afterwards
but
you
might
as
soon
have
tried
to
thaw
an
iceberg
with
a
box
of
matches
as
to
get
him
round
again
by
gentleness
and
affection
he
was
the
sort
that
ca
be
won
with
kindness
he
felt
he
treated
the
world
better
than
the
world
had
treated
him
and
the
thought
shriveled
his
heart
a
bit
always
shy
and
suspicious
you
might
say
and
yet
underneath
it
the
most
honorable
and
upright
and
man
you
could
wish
to
meet
hyssop
loved
him
like
her
life
and
she
got
a
bit
poorly
in
health
after
their
sad
quarrel
then
chance
willed
it
that
going
down
from
princetown
to
plymouth
by
train
to
see
a
chemist
and
get
something
to
make
her
eat
who
should
be
in
the
selfsame
carriage
but
drake
and
his
hind
thomas
parsons
there
was
others
there
too
and
it
fell
out
that
an
old
fellow
as
knowed
jonathan
grandfather
before
him
brought
up
the
yarn
about
miser
brimpson
and
asked
young
drake
if
he
took
any
stock
in
it
of
course
the
man
such
foolery
and
told
the
old
chap
not
to
talk
nonsense
like
that
in
the
ear
of
the
nineteenth
century
but
when
jonathan
and
parsons
had
got
out
of
the
train
which
they
did
do
at
yelverton
station
hyssop
as
knowed
the
old
man
axed
him
to
tell
more
about
the
miser
and
he
explained
so
well
as
he
knew
how
that
brimpson
drake
had
made
untold
thousands
out
of
the
french
and
american
prisoners
and
that
without
doubt
was
all
hidden
even
to
this
day
at
dunnabridge
of
course
jonathan
too
clever
to
believe
such
a
tale
like
his
father
before
him
but
his
grandfather
believed
it
and
the
old
blid
spent
half
his
time
poking
about
the
farm
only
unfortunately
he
did
have
no
luck
but
is
there
for
sure
and
if
jonathan
had
enough
faith
come
by
it
not
by
digging
and
wasting
time
and
labor
but
by
doing
what
is
right
and
proper
when
you
dealing
with
such
matters
and
what
might
that
be
axed
miss
burges
just
then
however
the
train
for
plymouth
ran
up
and
the
old
man
told
her
that
he
explain
some
other
time
this
generation
laughs
at
such
things
he
said
but
they
laugh
best
who
laugh
last
and
for
all
we
can
say
to
the
contrary
is
nought
but
his
conceit
and
pride
be
standing
between
that
youth
and
the
wealth
of
a
bank
hyssop
she
thought
a
lot
upon
this
but
she
had
no
need
to
go
to
the
old
chap
again
as
she
meant
to
do
for
when
she
got
home
her
uncle
farmer
stonewer
knowed
all
about
the
matter
and
told
her
how
a
very
rooted
opinion
among
the
last
generation
that
a
spirit
never
could
leave
its
hidden
hoard
till
the
stuff
was
brought
to
light
and
in
human
hands
once
more
millions
of
good
money
has
been
found
in
that
manner
if
all
we
hear
is
true
declared
farmer
jimmy
and
if
one
miser
has
been
known
to
walk
which
nobody
can
deny
then
why
should
another
them
as
believe
in
such
dark
things
and
i
do
say
i
do
and
i
do
say
i
do
them
as
know
of
such
mysteries
happening
in
their
own
recollection
or
in
the
memory
of
their
friends
would
doubtless
say
that
miser
brimpson
still
creeps
around
his
gold
now
and
again
and
if
that
money
be
within
the
four
corners
of
dunnabridge
farm
and
if
jonathan
happed
to
be
on
the
lookout
on
the
rightful
night
and
at
the
rightful
moment
is
almost
any
odds
but
he
might
see
his
forbear
sitting
over
his
like
a
hen
on
a
clutch
of
eggs
and
so
recover
the
hoard
but
faith
needed
for
such
a
deed
stonewer
told
her
niece
and
that
creature
have
no
faith
too
proud
he
is
to
believe
in
anything
he
do
understand
was
even
so
with
lucifer
afore
him
if
you
told
him
jonathan
this
news
he
rather
let
the
money
go
than
set
off
in
cold
blood
yet
there
it
is
and
a
fashion
of
chap
with
the
lord
on
his
side
and
a
trustful
heart
in
his
bosom
might
very
like
recover
all
them
tubs
of
cash
the
miser
come
by
and
then
he
have
thousands
to
my
poor
tens
said
hyssop
not
that
he
ever
come
back
to
me
now
i
reckon
but
all
the
same
she
knowed
by
the
look
in
jonathan
eye
when
they
met
that
he
loved
her
still
and
that
his
silly
proud
heart
was
hungering
after
her
yet
though
he
rather
have
been
drawn
under
a
harrow
than
show
a
spark
of
what
was
burning
there
and
so
upon
this
nonsense
about
a
buried
treasure
she
set
to
work
again
to
use
her
brains
and
see
if
there
might
be
any
road
out
of
the
trouble
by
way
of
miser
brimpson
ghost
what
she
did
none
but
them
as
helped
her
ever
knew
until
the
story
comed
round
to
me
but
was
the
cleverest
thing
that
ever
i
heard
of
a
maiden
doing
and
it
worked
a
wonder
in
fact
i
ca
see
but
a
single
objection
to
the
plot
though
that
was
a
serious
thing
for
the
girl
it
lay
in
the
fact
that
there
had
to
be
a
secret
between
hyssop
and
her
husband
and
she
kept
it
close
as
the
grave
until
the
grave
itself
closed
over
him
yet
was
an
innocent
secret
too
and
when
said
is
a
wedded
pair
in
five
hundred
as
have
each
their
one
little
cupboard
fast
locked
with
the
key
throwed
away
six
months
passed
by
and
jonathan
worked
as
only
he
knowed
how
to
work
and
tried
to
forget
his
sad
disappointment
by
dint
of
toil
early
and
late
he
labored
and
got
permission
to
reclaim
a
bit
of
moor
for
a
newtake
and
so
added
a
very
fair
three
acres
to
his
farm
he
noticed
about
this
time
that
his
hind
parsons
did
oft
drag
up
the
subject
of
miser
brimpson
drake
and
first
jonathan
laughed
and
then
he
was
angered
and
bade
thomas
hold
his
peace
but
though
a
very
obedient
and
humble
sort
of
man
parsons
would
hark
back
to
the
subject
and
tell
how
his
father
had
known
a
man
who
was
own
brother
to
a
miser
and
how
when
the
miser
died
his
own
brother
had
seen
him
clear
as
truth
in
the
of
his
room
three
nights
after
they
buried
him
and
how
they
made
search
and
found
not
three
feet
from
where
the
ghost
had
stood
a
place
in
the
wall
with
seventeen
golden
sovereigns
hid
in
it
and
a
white
witch
cure
for
glanders
thomas
parsons
swore
on
the
book
to
this
and
he
said
as
a
certain
fact
that
new
year
night
was
the
time
most
misers
walked
and
he
advised
jonathan
not
to
be
dead
to
his
own
interests
at
least
as
a
thinking
man
that
believes
in
religion
and
the
powers
of
the
air
in
bible
word
you
might
give
it
a
chance
said
thomas
and
then
jonathan
told
him
to
shut
his
mouth
and
not
shame
dunnabridge
by
talking
such
childish
nonsense
the
next
autumn
jonathan
went
up
beyond
exeter
to
buy
some
of
they
horned
scotch
sheep
and
he
wanted
for
parsons
to
go
with
him
but
his
man
falled
ill
the
night
afore
and
so
young
hacker
went
instead
drake
reckoned
then
that
thomas
parsons
would
have
to
leave
for
dunnabridge
were
a
place
for
sick
folk
and
he
made
up
his
mind
after
he
came
back
to
turn
the
old
chap
off
but
thomas
was
better
when
the
master
got
home
so
the
question
of
sacking
him
was
let
be
and
jonathan
contented
himself
by
telling
tom
that
if
he
falled
ill
again
be
the
last
time
and
parsons
said
that
was
as
it
should
be
but
he
hoped
that
at
his
age
merely
or
thereabout
he
be
troubled
with
his
breathing
parts
again
for
half
a
score
o
years
at
least
he
added
that
he
done
his
work
as
usual
while
the
master
was
away
but
he
did
mention
that
hyssop
burges
had
made
so
bold
as
to
call
at
dunnabridge
with
a
pony
and
cart
and
that
she
spent
a
tidy
long
time
there
and
gone
all
over
the
house
and
farmyard
among
other
places
afore
she
drove
off
again
and
the
next
chapter
of
the
story
was
told
by
jonathan
himself
to
his
two
men
on
the
first
day
of
the
following
year
there
was
but
little
light
of
morning
just
then
and
the
three
of
were
putting
down
some
bread
and
bacon
and
a
quart
of
tea
by
candlelight
in
the
dunnabridge
kitchen
when
thomas
saw
that
his
master
eating
nothing
to
name
instead
he
went
out
to
the
barrel
and
drawed
himself
a
pint
of
ale
and
got
along
by
the
peat
fire
with
it
and
stuck
his
boots
so
nigh
the
scads
as
he
dared
without
burning
what
amiss
said
thomas
do
say
you
sick
master
and
if
you
be
i
lay
no
liquor
smaller
than
brandy
will
fetch
you
round
i
ba
sick
answered
jonathan
shortly
he
seemed
in
doubt
whether
to
go
on
then
he
resolved
to
do
so
there
was
a
man
in
the
yard
last
night
he
said
and
if
i
thought
as
either
of
you
chaps
knowed
anything
about
it
i
turn
you
off
this
instant
afore
you
got
the
bacon
out
of
your
throats
a
man
never
cried
parsons
how
was
it
the
dog
did
bark
asked
hacker
how
the
devil
do
i
know
why
he
did
bark
answered
jonathan
dark
as
night
and
staring
in
the
fire
one
side
of
his
face
was
red
with
the
flames
and
side
blue
as
steel
along
of
the
daylight
just
beginning
to
filter
in
at
the
window
all
i
can
say
is
this
he
added
i
turned
in
at
ten
just
after
that
brace
of
old
fools
to
brownberry
went
off
to
see
the
new
year
in
i
slept
till
midnight
then
something
woke
me
with
a
start
what
i
ca
tell
but
some
loud
sound
near
at
hand
no
doubt
i
was
going
off
again
when
i
heard
more
row
a
steady
sound
repeated
over
and
over
and
first
i
thought
was
owls
and
then
i
heard
was
not
you
might
have
said
was
somebody
thumping
on
a
barrel
but
at
any
rate
i
woke
up
and
sat
up
and
found
the
noise
was
in
the
yard
i
looked
out
of
my
chamber
window
then
and
the
moon
was
bright
as
day
and
the
stars
sparkling
likewise
and
there
down
by
judge
where
the
grows
i
see
a
man
standing
by
the
old
barrel
as
plain
as
i
see
you
chaps
now
the
judge
table
be
a
wonnerful
curiosity
at
dunnabridge
and
if
you
go
there
you
do
well
to
ax
to
see
it
is
a
gert
slab
of
moorstone
said
to
have
come
from
crokern
torr
where
the
tinners
held
theer
parliament
in
the
ancient
times
now
it
bides
over
a
with
a
tree
rising
up
above
jonathan
took
his
breath
when
he
got
that
far
and
fetched
his
pipe
out
of
his
pocket
and
lighted
it
then
he
drank
off
half
the
beer
and
spat
in
the
fire
and
went
on
a
man
so
tall
as
me
if
not
taller
he
got
one
of
them
old
white
beaver
hats
on
his
head
and
he
wore
a
flowing
white
beard
so
long
as
my
tail
and
he
walked
up
and
down
up
and
down
over
the
stones
like
a
sailor
walks
up
and
down
on
the
deck
of
a
ship
i
shouted
to
the
chap
but
he
did
take
no
more
notice
than
the
moon
up
and
down
he
went
and
then
i
told
him
if
he
was
off
inside
two
minutes
i
get
my
and
let
fly
still
he
paid
no
heed
and
i
mind
saying
to
you
men
that
for
half
a
second
i
felt
and
down
the
back
but
was
only
the
cold
i
reckon
for
my
window
was
wide
open
and
i
been
leaning
out
of
it
for
a
good
while
into
ten
degrees
of
frost
after
that
i
got
angry
and
went
down
house
and
hitched
the
gun
off
the
hooks
over
the
mantelpiece
and
ran
out
just
as
i
was
in
nought
but
my
boots
and
my
nightshirt
the
hour
was
so
still
as
the
grave
at
first
and
the
moon
shone
on
the
river
far
below
and
lit
up
the
eaves
and
windows
and
then
through
the
silence
i
heard
widecombe
bells
ringing
in
the
new
year
but
the
old
in
his
top
hat
was
gone
not
a
hair
of
his
beard
did
he
leave
behind
i
looked
about
and
then
up
came
the
dog
barking
like
fury
not
knowing
who
i
was
dressed
that
way
till
he
heard
my
voice
and
that
the
tale
and
who
be
that
curious
old
rascal
i
much
like
to
know
they
did
answer
at
first
and
the
daylight
gained
on
then
old
parsons
spoke
up
and
wagged
his
head
and
swore
that
was
no
man
his
master
had
seen
but
a
creature
from
the
other
world
i
lay
my
life
he
said
was
the
spectrum
of
miser
brimpson
as
you
saw
walking
and
i
take
oath
by
the
new
year
that
was
his
way
to
show
where
his
stuff
be
buried
for
god
sake
he
says
if
you
do
want
to
get
into
trouble
with
unknown
creatures
go
out
and
pull
up
the
cobblestones
and
see
if
there
anything
underneath
but
jonathan
made
as
though
the
whole
thing
was
nonsense
and
let
neither
thomas
nor
hacker
move
a
pebble
only
the
next
day
he
went
off
to
a
very
old
chap
called
samuel
windeatt
whose
father
had
been
a
boy
at
the
time
of
the
war
prison
and
was
said
to
have
seen
and
known
miser
brimpson
in
the
flesh
and
the
old
man
declared
that
in
his
childish
days
he
heard
of
the
miser
and
that
he
certainly
wore
a
beaver
hat
and
had
a
white
beard
a
yard
long
so
jonathan
came
home
again
more
thoughtful
than
afore
and
finally
though
he
declared
that
he
was
ashamed
to
do
it
he
let
tom
overpersuade
him
and
two
days
after
the
three
men
set
to
work
where
drake
had
seen
the
spectrum
they
dug
and
they
dug
this
way
and
that
and
jonathan
found
nought
and
parsons
found
nought
but
hacker
came
upon
a
box
and
they
dragged
it
out
of
the
earth
and
underneath
of
it
was
another
box
like
the
first
they
was
a
pair
of
old
rotten
wood
chests
by
the
look
of
them
made
of
boards
nailed
together
with
rusty
nails
no
locks
or
keys
they
had
but
that
was
no
matter
for
they
fell
abroad
at
a
touch
and
inside
of
them
was
a
lot
of
plate
candlesticks
snuffers
table
silver
and
the
like
thunder
cried
out
jonathan
is
all
pewter
trash
not
worth
a
note
us
dig
again
and
dig
they
did
for
a
week
till
the
farmyard
in
that
place
was
turned
over
like
a
trenched
but
not
another
teaspoon
did
they
find
meantime
however
somebody
as
understood
such
things
explained
to
young
drake
that
the
stuff
unearthed
was
not
pewter
nor
yet
britannia
metal
neither
but
old
sheffield
plate
and
worth
plenty
of
good
money
at
that
jonathan
felt
too
mazed
with
the
event
to
do
anything
about
it
for
a
month
then
he
went
to
plymouth
and
took
a
few
pieces
of
the
find
in
his
bag
and
the
man
what
he
showed
to
was
so
terrible
interested
that
nothing
would
do
but
he
must
come
up
to
dunnabridge
and
see
the
lot
he
offered
two
hundred
and
fifty
pound
for
the
things
on
the
nail
so
jonathan
saw
very
clear
that
they
must
be
worth
a
good
bit
more
they
haggled
for
a
week
and
finally
the
owner
went
up
to
exeter
and
got
another
chap
to
name
a
price
in
the
long
run
the
dealers
halved
the
things
and
jonathan
comed
out
with
a
clear
three
hundred
and
pound
iii
he
was
very
pleased
to
talk
about
his
luck
and
inquisitive
people
got
but
little
out
of
him
on
the
subject
but
of
course
parsons
and
hacker
spoke
free
and
often
on
the
subject
for
was
the
greatest
adventure
as
had
ever
come
to
them
in
their
lives
and
from
telling
the
tale
over
and
over
old
parsons
got
to
talk
about
it
as
if
he
seen
the
ghost
himself
then
after
he
chewed
over
the
matter
for
a
space
of
three
or
four
months
and
spring
was
come
again
jonathan
drake
went
off
one
night
to
white
works
just
the
same
as
he
used
to
do
when
he
was
courting
hyssop
burges
and
there
was
the
little
party
as
usual
with
stonewer
knitting
and
farmer
reading
yesterday
newspaper
and
hyssop
sewing
in
her
place
by
her
aunt
well
says
farmer
jimmy
wonders
never
cease
and
to
see
you
again
here
be
almost
so
big
a
wonder
as
that
they
tell
about
of
the
old
miser
i
sure
we
all
give
you
joy
jonathan
and
i
need
tell
you
as
we
was
cruel
pleased
to
hear
about
it
the
young
man
thanked
them
very
civilly
and
said
how
was
a
coorious
and
he
did
hardly
know
what
to
think
of
the
matter
even
to
that
day
i
should
reckon
was
a
bit
of
nonsense
what
i
dreamed
he
said
but
money
money
as
who
should
know
better
than
me
and
by
the
same
token
i
want
a
few
words
with
hyssop
if
she
willing
to
give
me
ten
minutes
of
her
time
you
welcome
drake
she
said
he
started
at
the
surname
but
she
got
up
and
they
went
off
just
in
the
usual
way
to
the
parlor
and
when
they
was
there
she
sat
down
in
her
old
corner
of
the
horsehair
sofa
and
looked
at
him
but
he
sit
down
not
at
first
he
walked
about
fierce
and
talked
fierce
i
ax
one
question
afore
i
go
on
and
if
the
answer
what
i
fear
i
trouble
you
no
more
he
said
in
a
word
be
you
tokened
again
i
suppose
you
be
for
you
not
the
sort
to
go
begging
say
it
quick
if
so
and
i
be
off
and
trouble
you
no
further
no
drake
i
free
as
the
day
you
you
throwed
me
over
she
answered
in
a
very
quiet
little
voice
he
snorted
at
that
but
was
too
mighty
thankful
to
quarrel
with
the
words
she
could
see
he
began
to
grow
terrible
excited
now
and
he
walked
up
and
down
taking
shorter
and
shorter
strides
this
way
and
that
like
a
hungry
caged
tiger
as
knows
his
bit
of
be
on
the
way
at
last
he
bursts
out
again
there
was
a
lot
of
lies
told
about
that
old
plate
us
found
at
dunnabridge
but
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
i
sold
it
for
three
hundred
and
pounds
so
tom
parsons
told
uncle
a
wonderful
thing
and
we
sat
up
all
night
talking
about
it
mr
drake
for
god
sake
call
me
he
cried
out
and
tell
me
tell
me
what
the
figure
of
your
legacy
was
you
must
tell
me
you
ca
withhold
it
is
life
or
death
to
me
she
never
seen
him
so
excited
but
very
well
knowed
what
was
in
his
mind
if
you
must
know
you
must
she
answered
i
thought
i
told
you
when
when
no
you
did
i
would
bide
to
hear
whatever
was
you
got
more
than
me
and
that
was
all
i
cared
about
but
now
if
by
good
fortune
less
than
mine
you
understand
of
course
is
less
a
hundred
and
eighty
pound
and
the
interest
a
little
over
two
hundred
in
all
is
what
i
gotten
thank
god
he
said
then
he
axed
her
if
she
could
marry
him
still
or
if
she
knew
too
much
about
his
ways
and
his
ideas
to
care
about
doing
so
and
she
took
him
again
you
see
hyssop
burges
was
my
mother
and
when
father
died
i
had
the
rights
of
the
story
from
her
by
that
time
the
old
people
at
white
works
and
tom
parsons
was
all
gone
home
and
the
secret
remained
safe
enough
with
hyssop
herself
the
great
difficulty
was
to
put
half
her
money
and
more
slap
into
jonathan
hands
without
his
knowing
how
it
got
there
and
even
when
the
game
with
the
ghost
was
hit
upon
was
hard
to
know
how
to
do
it
clever
hyssop
wanted
to
hide
golden
sovereigns
at
dunnabridge
but
her
uncle
with
wonnerful
wit
pointed
out
that
they
all
be
dated
and
to
get
three
hundred
sovereigns
and
more
a
hundred
years
old
could
never
have
been
managed
then
old
thomas
who
was
in
the
secret
of
course
and
played
the
part
of
miser
brimpson
and
got
five
pounds
for
doing
it
so
clever
and
another
five
after
from
his
master
when
the
stuff
was
found
he
thought
upon
trinkums
and
jewels
and
finally
stonewer
as
had
a
friend
in
the
business
said
that
sheffield
plate
would
do
the
trick
and
she
was
right
the
plate
was
bought
for
three
hundred
and
eighty
pound
and
kept
close
at
white
works
till
was
known
that
jonathan
meant
to
go
away
and
bide
away
some
days
then
my
mother
drove
across
with
it
and
thomas
made
the
cases
wi
old
rotten
boards
and
they
drove
a
slant
hole
under
the
cobbles
and
got
all
vitty
again
long
afore
young
drake
came
back
home
me
and
jonathan
was
wedded
in
the
fall
of
that
year
said
my
mother
to
me
when
she
told
the
tale
and
come
the
next
new
year
night
he
was
at
our
chamber
window
as
the
clock
struck
twelve
and
bided
there
looking
out
into
the
yard
for
an
hour
keen
as
the
hawk
that
he
was
he
thought
i
must
be
asleep
but
well
i
knowed
he
was
seeking
for
an
old
man
in
a
beaver
hat
wi
a
long
white
beard
and
well
i
knowed
he
never
see
him
again
of
course
your
father
took
good
care
not
to
tell
me
the
next
morning
that
he
been
on
the
lookout
for
the
ghost
and
my
mother
in
her
own
last
days
oft
dwelt
on
that
trick
and
sometimes
she
say
as
the
time
for
meeting
father
got
nearer
and
nearer
i
wonder
if
make
any
difference
in
heaven
where
no
secrets
be
hid
and
knowing
father
so
well
as
i
had
i
felt
very
sure
as
it
might
make
a
mighty
lot
of
difference
so
in
my
crafty
way
i
hedged
and
told
mother
that
for
my
part
i
felt
sartain
there
were
some
secrets
that
would
even
be
allowed
to
come
out
at
judgment
day
for
fear
of
turning
heaven
into
place
and
that
this
was
one
of
she
always
used
to
fret
at
that
however
i
want
for
it
to
come
out
she
say
and
if
jonathan
do
know
i
shall
certainly
tell
him
i
kept
it
in
long
enough
and
i
ca
trust
myself
to
do
it
no
more
he
got
to
know
and
with
all
eternity
to
get
over
it
and
forgive
me
in
i
have
a
right
to
be
hopeful
that
he
will
hyssop
drake
died
in
that
fixed
resolve
and
i
sure
i
trust
that
when
my
turn
to
join
my
parents
again
i
shall
find
no
shadow
between
but
there
a
lot
of
doubt
about
it
knowing
father

the
haunted
photograph
by
ruth
mcenery
stuart
from
june
by
permission
of
the
haunted
photograph
by
ruth
mcenery
stuart
to
the
ordinary
observer
it
was
just
a
common
photograph
of
a
cheap
summer
hotel
it
hung
sumptuously
framed
in
plush
over
the
widow
morris
mantel
the
one
resplendent
note
in
an
otherwise
modest
home
in
a
characteristic
queen
anne
village
one
had
only
to
see
the
rapt
face
of
its
owner
as
she
sat
in
her
weeds
before
the
picture
which
she
tearfully
pronounced
a
likeness
to
sympathize
with
the
townsfolk
who
looked
askance
at
the
bereaved
woman
even
while
they
bore
with
her
delusion
feeling
sure
that
her
sudden
sorrow
had
set
her
mind
agog
when
she
had
received
the
picture
through
the
mail
some
months
before
the
fire
which
consumed
the
hotel
a
fire
through
which
she
had
not
passed
but
out
of
which
she
had
come
a
widow
she
proudly
passed
it
around
among
the
friends
waiting
with
her
at
the
replying
to
their
questions
as
they
admired
it
oh
yes
that
where
he
works
if
you
can
call
it
work
he
the
head
steward
in
it
all
that
row
o
winders
where
you
see
the
awnin
down
they
his
an
them
that
ai
down
they
his
too
that
is
to
say
it
his
jurisdiction
you
see
he
got
the
whip
hand
over
the
cook
an
the
that
key
do
go
out
o
his
belt
unless
he
knows
who
what
an
he
firm
morris
always
was
he
like
the
iron
law
of
the
ephesians
what
key
it
was
an
old
lady
who
held
the
picture
at
arm
length
the
more
closely
to
scan
it
who
asked
the
question
she
asked
it
partly
to
know
as
neither
man
nor
key
appeared
in
the
photograph
and
partly
to
parry
the
historic
allusion
a
disturbing
sort
of
fire
for
which
morris
was
rather
noted
and
which
made
some
of
her
most
loyal
townsfolk
a
bit
shy
of
her
oh
i
ai
referrin
to
the
picture
she
hastened
to
explain
i
mean
the
keys
thet
he
always
carries
in
his
belt
the
joke
there
is
to
call
him
peter
an
he
takes
it
in
good
part
for
he
declares
if
there
such
a
thing
a
similitude
to
the
kingdom
o
heaven
a
hotel
why
it
in
the
providential
supply
department
which
in
a
manner
hangs
to
his
belt
he
always
humors
a
joke
on
himself
no
one
will
ever
know
through
what
painful
periods
of
unrequited
longing
the
widow
morris
had
sought
solace
in
this
her
only
cherished
relic
after
the
half
hour
of
which
had
made
her
in
her
own
vernacular
a
lonely
conflagrated
widow
with
a
heart
full
of
ashes
before
the
glad
moment
when
it
was
given
her
to
discern
in
it
an
unsuspected
and
novel
value
first
had
come
as
a
faint
gleam
of
comfort
the
reflection
that
although
her
dear
lost
one
was
not
in
evidence
in
the
picture
he
had
really
been
inside
the
building
when
the
photograph
was
taken
and
so
of
course
must
be
in
there
at
first
she
experienced
a
slight
disappointment
that
her
man
was
not
visible
at
door
or
window
but
it
was
only
a
passing
regret
it
was
really
better
to
feel
him
surely
and
broadly
within
at
large
in
the
great
house
free
to
pass
at
will
from
one
room
to
another
to
have
had
him
fixed
no
matter
how
effectively
would
have
been
a
limitation
as
it
was
she
pressed
the
picture
to
her
bosom
as
she
wondered
if
perchance
he
would
not
some
day
come
out
of
his
hiding
to
meet
her
it
was
a
muffled
pleasure
and
tremulously
entertained
at
first
but
the
very
whimsicality
of
it
was
an
appeal
to
her
sensitized
imagination
and
so
when
finally
the
thing
did
really
happen
it
is
small
wonder
that
it
came
somewhat
as
a
shock
it
appears
that
one
day
feeling
particularly
lonely
and
forlorn
and
having
no
other
comfort
she
was
pressing
her
face
against
the
row
of
in
the
room
without
awnings
this
being
her
nearest
approach
to
the
alleged
occupant
bosom
when
she
was
suddenly
startled
by
a
peculiar
swishing
sound
as
of
rain
whereupon
she
lifted
her
face
to
perceive
that
it
was
indeed
raining
and
then
glancing
back
at
the
photograph
she
distinctly
saw
her
husband
rushing
from
one
window
to
another
drawing
down
the
sashes
on
the
side
of
the
house
that
would
have
been
exposed
to
the
real
shower
whose
music
was
in
her
ears
this
was
a
great
discovery
and
naturally
enough
it
set
her
weeping
for
she
sobbed
it
made
her
feel
for
a
minute
that
she
had
lost
her
widowhood
and
that
after
the
shower
he
be
coming
home
it
might
well
make
any
one
cry
to
suddenly
lose
the
pivot
upon
which
his
emotions
are
swung
at
any
rate
morris
cried
she
said
that
she
cried
all
night
first
because
it
seemed
so
spooky
to
see
him
whose
remains
she
had
so
recently
buried
on
faith
waiving
recognition
in
the
débris
dashing
about
now
in
so
a
way
and
then
she
wept
because
after
all
he
did
not
come
this
was
the
formal
beginning
of
her
sense
of
personal
companionship
in
the
picture
companionship
yes
of
delight
in
it
for
there
is
even
delight
in
tears
in
some
situations
in
life
especially
is
this
true
of
one
whose
emotions
are
her
only
guides
as
seems
to
have
been
the
case
with
the
widow
morris
after
seeing
him
draw
the
and
he
had
drawn
them
ignoring
her
presence
she
sat
for
hours
waiting
for
the
rain
to
stop
it
seemed
to
have
set
in
for
a
long
spell
for
when
she
finally
fell
asleep
from
sheer
disappointment
towards
morning
it
was
still
raining
but
when
she
awoke
the
sun
shone
and
all
the
windows
in
the
picture
were
up
again
this
was
a
misleading
experience
however
for
she
soon
discovered
that
she
could
not
count
upon
any
line
of
conduct
by
the
man
in
the
hotel
as
the
fact
that
it
had
one
time
rained
in
the
photograph
at
the
same
time
that
it
rained
outside
was
but
a
coincidence
and
she
was
soon
surprised
to
perceive
all
quiet
along
the
hotel
piazza
not
even
an
awning
flapping
while
the
earth
on
her
plane
was
torn
by
storms
on
one
memorable
occasion
when
her
husband
had
appeared
flapping
the
from
within
with
a
towel
she
had
thought
for
one
brief
moment
that
he
was
beckoning
to
her
and
that
she
might
have
to
go
to
him
and
she
was
beginning
to
experience
terror
with
shortness
of
breath
and
other
premonitions
of
sudden
passing
when
she
discovered
that
he
was
merely
killing
flies
and
she
flurriedly
fanned
herself
with
the
asbestos
mat
which
she
had
seized
from
the
stove
beside
her
and
staggered
out
to
a
seat
under
the
mulberries
as
she
stammered
i
do
declare
morris
be
the
death
of
me
yet
he
as
much
care
to
me
dead
as
he
was
alive
i
made
sure
made
sure
he
come
after
me
then
feeling
her
own
fidelity
challenged
she
hastened
to
add
not
that
i
had
rather
go
to
him
than
to
take
any
trip
in
the
world
but
but
i
never
did
fancy
that
hotel
and
since
i
got
used
to
him
there
so
constant
i
feel
sure
that
where
we
put
up
my
belief
is
anyway
that
if
there
hereafters
for
some
things
hereafters
for
all
from
what
i
can
gather
i
reckon
i
a
kind
of
a
cross
between
a
swedenborgian
and
a
that
of
course
engrafted
on
to
a
methodist
now
that
hotel
when
it
was
consumed
by
fire
which
to
it
was
the
same
as
mortal
death
why
it
either
ascended
into
heaven
in
smoke
or
it
fell
in
ashes
to
the
other
place
if
it
died
worthy
like
as
not
it
undergoin
repairs
now
for
a
jasper
cupalos
an
but
of
course
such
as
that
could
be
run
up
in
a
twinklin
still
from
what
i
heard
it
more
likely
gone
to
its
deserts
it
would
seem
hard
for
a
hotel
with
so
many
corridors
an
palmed
embrasures
with
sofas
to
live
along
without
sin
she
stood
on
her
wiping
the
face
of
the
picture
as
she
spoke
and
as
she
began
to
back
down
she
discovered
the
cat
under
her
elbow
glaring
at
the
picture
yes
kitty
spit
away
she
exclaimed
like
as
not
you
see
even
more
than
i
do
and
as
she
slipped
the
ladder
back
into
the
closet
she
remarked
this
to
herself
strictly
if
it
had
been
for
poor
puss
i
had
a
heap
more
pleasure
out
o
this
picture
than
what
i
have
had
or
will
be
likely
to
have
again
the
way
she
taken
on
i
almost
come
to
hate
it
a
serpent
had
entered
her
poor
little
eden
even
the
monster
constrictor
who
if
given
full
swing
would
not
spare
a
bone
of
her
meager
comfort
a
neighbor
who
chanced
to
come
in
at
the
time
unobserved
overheard
the
last
remark
and
morris
seeing
that
she
was
there
continued
in
an
unchanged
tone
while
she
gave
her
a
chair
of
course
mis
withers
you
can
easy
guess
who
i
refer
to
i
mean
that
wench
that
kep
the
books
an
answered
the
telephone
at
the
hotel
when
she
found
the
time
from
her
meddlin
somehow
i
never
thought
about
her
bein
with
morris
till
puss
give
her
away
puss
never
did
like
the
girl
when
she
was
alive
an
the
first
time
i
see
her
scratch
an
spit
at
the
picture
just
the
way
she
used
to
do
whenever
come
in
sight
why
it
just
struck
me
like
a
clap
thunder
out
of
a
clear
sky
that
puss
knew
who
she
was
at
i
switched
around
sudden
an
glanced
up
sudden
an
well
what
i
seen
i
seen
there
was
that
typewriter
settin
in
the
o
morris
butler
pantry
an
if
she
did
wink
at
me
malicious
then
i
do
know
malice
when
i
see
it
she
used
her
fingers
against
her
nose
too
most
defiant
and
impolite
so
i
says
to
puss
i
says
i
says
in
that
hotel
sure
as
fate
annabel
bender
has
got
the
better
o
me
for
once
an
tell
the
truth
it
did
spoil
the
photograph
for
me
for
a
while
for
of
course
after
that
if
i
did
see
him
somewheres
on
the
watch
for
his
faithful
spouse
i
say
to
myself
inside
there
with
that
hussy
you
know
a
man
a
man
mis
withers
morris
an
with
his
lawful
wife
cut
off
an
indefinitely
divorced
by
a
longevitied
family
an
another
burned
in
with
him
well
his
faithfulness
is
put
to
a
trial
by
fire
as
you
might
say
so
as
i
say
it
spoiled
the
picture
for
me
for
a
while
an
to
make
matters
worse
it
was
any
time
before
i
recollected
that
campbellite
preacher
thet
was
burned
in
with
them
an
with
that
my
imagination
run
riot
an
i
think
to
myself
they
inclined
they
have
things
handy
then
i
ketch
myself
an
say
your
faith
in
scripture
mary
marthy
matthews
named
after
two
bible
women
an
born
daughter
to
an
apostle
what
the
use
i
say
an
so
first
an
last
i
get
a
sort
o
alpha
an
omega
comfort
out
the
passage
about
no
givin
in
marriage
still
there
be
times
pray
as
i
would
when
them
three
would
loom
up
him
an
her
the
campbellite
preacher
i
know
his
license
to
marry
would
run
out
but
for
eternity
of
course
we
do
know
seem
like
everything
would
last
forever
an
then
again
if
i
got
a
widow
freedom
morris
must
be
classed
as
a
widower
if
he
anything
then
i
get
some
relief
in
thinkin
about
his
disposition
good
as
he
was
morris
was
not
in
the
long
run
but
day
in
an
day
out
an
even
if
he
be
taken
up
with
her
he
get
a
distaste
the
minute
he
reelized
she
be
there
interminable
that
morris
why
did
he
used
to
get
nervous
just
seein
around
an
me
his
own
selected
an
did
i
use
to
make
some
excuse
to
send
him
over
to
mame
maddern
ma
ma
so
he
be
harmlessly
diverted
she
was
full
talk
and
she
was
an
asthmatic
but
he
come
home
from
them
visits
an
call
me
his
child
wife
i
had
my
happy
moments
you
know
a
man
get
tired
of
himself
even
if
he
condemned
to
it
too
continual
and
think
of
that
blondinetted
typewriter
for
a
steady
diet
to
a
man
like
morris
imagine
her
when
her
hair
dye
started
to
give
out
green
streaks
in
that
pompadour
so
knowin
my
man
i
take
courage
an
i
think
me
cut
off
he
soon
be
wantin
me
more
than
ever
an
so
he
does
it
got
so
now
that
glance
up
at
that
hotel
any
time
i
will
i
can
generally
find
him
on
the
lookout
many
the
time
i
stole
in
an
put
on
a
favoryte
apron
o
his
with
blue
bows
on
it
when
we
be
alone
an
nobody
to
remark
about
me
breakin
my
mournin
dear
me
how
full
o
he
was
a
regular
boy
at
when
he
passed
away
was
it
any
wonder
that
her
friends
exchanged
glances
while
morris
entertained
them
in
so
droll
a
way
still
as
time
passed
and
she
not
only
brightened
in
the
light
of
her
delusion
but
proceeded
to
meet
the
conditions
of
her
own
life
by
opening
a
small
shop
in
her
home
and
when
she
exhibited
a
wholesome
sense
of
profit
and
loss
her
neighbors
were
quite
ready
to
accept
her
on
terms
of
mental
responsibility
with
occupation
and
a
modest
success
emotional
disturbance
was
surely
giving
place
to
an
even
calm
when
one
day
something
happened
morris
sat
behind
her
counter
sorting
notions
puss
asleep
beside
her
when
she
heard
the
swish
of
thin
silk
with
a
breath
of
familiar
perfume
and
looking
up
whom
did
she
see
but
the
blond
lady
of
her
troubled
dreams
striding
bodily
up
to
the
counter
smiling
as
she
swished
at
the
sight
the
good
woman
first
rose
to
her
feet
and
then
as
suddenly
dropped
flopped
breathless
and
white
backward
and
had
to
be
revived
so
that
for
the
space
of
some
minutes
things
happened
very
fast
that
is
if
we
may
believe
the
flurried
testimony
of
the
blonde
who
in
going
over
it
two
hours
later
had
more
than
once
to
stop
for
breath
well
say
she
panted
did
you
ever
a
turn
as
took
her
i
had
no
more
stepped
in
the
door
when
she
succumbed
green
as
the
ganges
into
her
own
an
it
full
an
she
was
on
the
eve
floppin
back
into
the
prunin
scizzor
points
up
when
i
scrambled
over
the
counter
breakin
my
in
two
which
she
welcome
to
poor
thing
then
i
loaned
her
my
which
she
held
her
breath
against
until
it
got
to
be
a
case
of
smell
or
die
an
she
smelt
then
it
was
a
case
of
temporary
spasms
for
a
minute
the
salts
spillin
out
over
her
face
but
when
the
accident
evaporated
an
she
opened
her
eyes
rational
i
thought
to
myself
she
do
know
she
keeled
an
would
be
humiliated
if
she
did
so
i
acted
callous
an
i
says
offhand
like
i
says
pushin
her
apron
around
behind
her
over
its
so
to
cover
up
the
eggs
which
i
thought
had
better
be
broke
to
her
gently
i
says
just
called
in
mis
morris
to
borry
your
recipe
for
or
maybe
get
you
to
bake
one
for
us
i
knew
she
baked
on
orders
an
with
that
what
does
she
do
but
go
over
again
limp
as
wet
starch
down
an
through
every
egg
in
that
basket
solid
fluid
well
by
this
time
a
man
who
had
seen
her
at
her
first
worst
an
run
for
a
doctor
he
come
in
with
three
an
whilst
they
were
bowin
to
each
other
an
backin
i
giv
stimulus
an
she
turned
upon
me
one
rememberable
gaze
an
she
says
says
she
you
think
they
have
the
gall
to
try
to
get
me
to
cook
for
ordered
an
with
that
over
she
toppled
again
no
pulse
nor
nothin
same
as
the
dead
while
the
blonde
talked
she
busied
herself
with
her
loosely
falling
locks
which
she
tried
vainly
to
entrap
an
yet
you
say
she
ai
classed
as
crazy
i
say
it
of
her
sure
an
so
old
morris
is
dead
burned
in
that
old
hotel
well
well
poor
old
fellow
dear
old
place
what
times
i
had
she
spoke
through
a
mouthful
of
gilt
hairpins
and
her
voice
was
as
an
æolian
harp
an
he
burned
in
it
an
she
a
widow
yet
yes
i
did
hear
been
a
fire
but
you
never
can
tell
i
thought
the
chimney
might
burned
out
an
i
was
in
the
thick
of
bein
engaged
to
the
night
clerk
at
the
singin
needles
hotel
at
pineville
at
the
time
an
there
no
regular
mail
there
i
thought
the
story
might
be
exaggerated
oh
no
i
did
marry
the
night
clerk
i
a
bride
now
married
to
the
head
steward
same
rank
as
poor
old
morris
an
we
just
happy
i
used
to
pleg
morris
about
hair
but
i
have
to
let
up
on
that
now
mine
as
red
again
as
hers
no
not
my
hair
hair
it
as
red
as
a
flannen
drawer
every
bit
an
grain
but
say
she
added
presently
when
she
gets
better
just
tell
her
never
mind
about
that
i
copied
it
out
of
her
book
whilst
she
was
under
the
weather
an
dropped
a
dime
in
her
i
recollect
how
old
morris
used
to
look
forward
to
her
he
be
goin
home
an
you
know
there
nothin
like
ammunition
in
marriage
even
if
you
never
need
it
mine
in
that
frame
of
mind
now
that
transforms
my
gingerbread
into
but
the
time
may
come
when
i
have
to
beat
my
eggs
to
a
fluff
even
for
so
not
to
have
it
taste
like
gingerbread
to
him
oh
no
he
not
with
me
this
trip
i
just
run
down
for
a
lark
to
show
my
folks
my
ring
an
things
an
let
see
it
really
so
he
give
me
considerable
jewelry
his
first
taste
run
that
way
an
they
ai
no
children
yes
this
amethyst
is
the
i
selected
that
on
account
of
him
bein
a
widower
it
the
nearest
i
come
to
wearin
second
mournin
for
a
woman
i
ca
exactly
grieve
after
the
year
not
bein
up
is
why
he
stayed
home
this
trip
he
did
like
to
be
seen
the
same
old
haunts
with
another
till
it
up
i
would
wait
because
tell
the
truth
i
was
afraid
he
ai
like
a
married
man
with
me
about
money
yet
an
it
liable
to
seize
him
any
day
he
might
say
that
he
could
afford
the
trip
or
that
we
could
which
would
amount
to
the
same
thing
i
rather
liked
him
bein
a
little
ticklish
about
goin
around
with
me
for
a
while
it
one
thing
to
do
a
thing
another
to
be
brazen
about
it
it
but
if
she
do
get
better
the
reversion
was
to
the
widow
morris
if
she
do
get
her
mind
poor
thing
there
a
fine
insane
asylum
just
out
of
pineville
an
i
like
the
best
in
the
world
to
look
out
for
her
it
would
make
an
excuse
for
me
to
go
in
they
say
they
have
high
old
times
there
some
days
they
let
the
inmates
do
any
old
thing
that
harmless
they
even
give
unpoisonous
paints
an
let
paint
each
other
up
one
man
insisted
he
was
a
an
ringed
himself
accordingly
an
then
another
chased
him
around
for
a
stick
of
peppermint
candy
think
of
all
that
inside
a
close
fence
an
a
town
so
dull
an
yes
they
say
thursdays
is
paint
days
an
of
course
fridays
they
are
scrub
days
they
pass
around
turpentine
an
hide
the
matches
but
of
course
mis
morris
may
get
the
better
of
it
every
woman
that
can
stand
widowin
an
sometimes
them
that
has
got
the
least
out
of
marriage
will
seem
the
most
deprived
to
lose
it
so
they
say
the
blonde
was
a
person
of
words
when
morris
had
fully
revived
and
after
a
restoring
sleep
had
got
her
bearings
and
when
she
realized
clearly
that
her
supposed
rival
had
actually
shown
up
in
the
flesh
she
visibly
braced
up
her
neighbors
understood
that
it
must
have
been
a
shock
to
be
suddenly
confronted
with
any
souvenir
of
the
hotel
fire
so
one
had
expressed
it
and
the
incident
soon
passed
out
of
the
village
mind
it
was
not
long
after
this
incident
that
the
widow
confided
to
a
friend
that
she
was
coming
to
depend
upon
morris
for
advice
in
her
business
standing
as
he
does
in
that
hotel
door
between
two
worlds
as
you
might
say
why
he
sees
both
ways
and
oftentimes
he
detect
an
event
the
way
to
an
if
it
do
move
too
fast
why
i
can
hustle
an
get
the
better
of
things
it
was
as
if
she
had
a
private
wire
for
advance
information
and
she
declared
herself
happy
indeed
a
certain
ineffable
light
such
as
we
sometimes
see
in
the
eyes
of
those
newly
in
love
came
to
shine
from
the
face
of
the
widow
who
did
not
hesitate
to
affirm
looking
into
space
as
she
said
it
takin
all
things
into
consideration
i
can
truly
say
that
i
have
never
been
so
truly
and
ideely
married
as
since
my
widowhood
and
she
smiled
as
she
added
marriage
the
earthly
way
is
vicissitudinous
for
everybody
knows
that
anything
is
liable
to
happen
to
a
man
at
large
there
had
been
a
time
when
she
lamented
that
her
picture
was
not
as
it
would
seem
so
much
more
natural
but
she
immediately
reflected
that
that
hotel
would
never
have
gotten
into
her
little
house
and
that
after
all
the
main
thing
was
having
him
under
her
own
roof
as
the
months
passed
morris
albeit
she
seemed
serene
and
of
peaceful
mind
grew
very
white
and
still
fire
is
white
in
its
ultimate
intensity
the
top
spinning
its
fastest
is
said
to
sleep
and
the
dancing
dervish
is
still
so
misleading
signs
sometimes
mark
the
and
was
what
the
doctor
said
while
he
felt
her
translucent
wrist
and
prescribed
nails
in
her
if
he
secretly
knew
that
kind
nature
was
gently
letting
down
the
bars
so
that
a
waiting
spirit
might
easily
pass
well
he
was
a
doctor
not
a
minister
his
business
was
with
the
body
and
he
ordered
repairs
she
was
only
and
well
when
she
passed
painlessly
out
of
life
it
seemed
to
be
simply
a
case
of
going
there
were
several
friends
at
her
bedside
the
night
she
went
and
to
them
she
turned
feeling
the
time
come
i
just
wanted
to
give
out
that
the
first
thing
i
intend
to
do
when
relieved
is
to
call
by
there
for
morris
she
lifted
her
weary
eyes
to
the
picture
as
she
spoke
for
morris
and
i
want
it
understood
that
it
be
a
vacant
house
from
the
minute
i
depart
so
if
there
any
other
woman
that
calculatin
to
have
any
from
them
windows
why
she
be
disappointed
she
or
they
the
one
obnoxious
person
i
thought
was
in
it
my
imagination
was
tempted
of
satan
an
i
was
misled
so
it
must
be
sold
for
just
what
it
is
just
a
photographer
photograph
if
it
a
picture
with
a
past
why
everybody
knows
what
that
past
is
and
will
respect
it
i
have
tried
to
conquer
myself
enough
to
bequeath
it
to
the
young
lady
i
suspicioned
but
human
nature
is
frail
an
i
ca
quite
do
it
although
doubtless
she
would
like
it
as
a
souvenir
maybe
she
find
it
a
little
too
souvenirish
to
suit
my
wifely
taste
and
yet
if
a
person
is
going
to
die
i
suppose
i
might
legate
it
to
her
partly
to
recompense
her
for
her
discretion
in
leaving
that
hotel
when
she
did
an
partly
for
undue
suspicion
there
a
few
debts
to
be
paid
but
there
eggs
an
things
that
pay
them
an
there
no
need
to
have
the
hen
settin
in
the
window
showcase
any
longer
it
was
a
good
advertisement
but
i
often
thought
it
might
be
embarrassin
to
her
she
was
growing
weaker
but
she
roused
herself
to
amend
better
raffle
the
picture
for
a
dollar
a
chance
an
let
the
proceeds
go
to
my
funeral
an
i
want
to
be
buried
in
the
general
grave
commingled
with
him
an
what
left
over
after
the
debts
are
paid
i
bequeath
to
to
make
amends
an
if
she
do
care
to
come
for
it
let
every
widow
in
town
draw
for
it
but
she
come
any
take
any
trip
if
it
paid
for
but
look
she
raised
her
eyes
excitedly
toward
the
mantel
look
what
that
he
wavin
it
looks
oh
yes
it
is
it
our
wings
two
pairs
mine
a
little
smaller
i
it
be
the
same
old
story
i
never
be
able
to
keep
up
to
keep
up
with
him
an
i
been
so
hap
yes
morris
i
comin
and
she
was
gone
into
a
peaceful
sleep
from
which
she
easily
passed
just
before
dawn
when
all
was
well
over
the
sitting
women
rose
with
one
accord
and
went
to
the
mantel
where
one
even
lighted
an
extra
candle
more
clearly
to
scan
the
mysterious
picture
finally
one
said
you
may
think
i
queer
but
it
does
look
different
to
me
already
so
it
does
said
another
taking
the
candle
like
a
house
for
rent
i
declare
it
gives
me
the
cold
shivers
i
pay
my
dollar
gladly
and
take
a
chance
for
it
whispered
a
third
but
i
would
let
such
a
thing
as
that
enter
my
happy
home
neither
would
i
nor
me
neither
i
had
trouble
enough
my
husband
first
portrait
has
brought
me
discord
enough
an
it
was
a
straight
likeness
i
do
want
any
more
pictures
to
put
in
the
loft
so
the
feeling
ran
among
the
wives
well
said
she
who
was
blowing
out
the
candle
i
draw
for
it
take
it
if
i
win
it
an
consider
it
a
sort
of
inheritance
i
never
inherited
anything
but
indigestion
the
last
speaker
was
a
maiden
lady
and
so
was
she
who
answered
chuckling
that
what
i
say
anything
for
a
change
there
be
some
excitement
in
a
picture
where
a
man
was
liable
to
show
up
it
more
than
i
got
now
i
do
declare
it
just
scandalous
the
way
we
gigglin
an
the
poor
soul
hardly
out
o
hearin
she
had
a
kind
heart
mis
morris
had
an
she
made
herself
happy
with
a
mighty
slim
chance
yes
she
did
and
i
only
wish
there
been
a
better
man
waitin
for
her
in
that
hotel
the
ghost
that
got
the
button
by
will
adams
from
may
by
permission
of
and
will
adams
the
ghost
that
got
the
button
by
will
adams
one
autumn
evening
when
the
days
were
shortening
and
the
darkness
fell
early
on
hotchkiss
and
the
frost
was
beginning
to
adorn
with
its
fine
glistening
lace
the
carbine
barrels
of
the
night
sentries
as
they
walked
post
sergeants
hansen
and
whitney
and
corporal
whitehall
had
come
to
stone
room
after
supper
feeling
the
need
common
to
all
men
in
the
first
cold
nights
of
the
year
for
a
cozy
room
a
good
smoke
and
congenial
companionship
the
steam
heat
newly
turned
on
wheezed
and
whined
through
the
radiator
the
air
was
blue
and
dense
with
tobacco
smoke
the
three
sergeants
reposed
in
restful
if
inelegant
attitudes
and
whitehall
his
feet
on
the
window
sill
and
his
wooden
chair
tilted
back
was
holding
forth
between
puffs
at
a
very
battered
pipe
about
an
old
colored
woman
who
kept
a
little
saloon
in
town
so
she
got
mad
at
those
k
troop
men
he
said
an
nex
day
when
turner
stopped
there
for
a
drink
she
says
git
outer
yere
you
men
fum
de
arsenic
wid
de
crossbones
on
you
caps
i
ai

a
bit
o
breath
left
in
me
i
was
all
to
the
bad
that

time
ter

even
that
screamin
streakin
thing

an
roun
my
knees
an
then
i
see
it
was
one
them
chinos
an
he
skeered
me
even
his
eyes
had
popped
clean
their
slits
an
his
tongue
was
hangin
out
by
the
roots
he
was
that
locoed
i
raised
the
long
yell
fer
corporal
of
the
guard
which
happened
by
good
luck
ter
be
buck
an
when
he
come
thinkin
from
the
whoops
i

we

bein
rushed
by

proddin
at

some
time
too
with

bein
in
such
a
flutter
an
hardly
able
ter
even
hand
out
his
darn
ol
pigeon
english
that
sounds
like
language
comin
out
of
a
sausage
machine
when
we
did
savvy
his
line
of
talk
we
found
out
he
seen
a
ghost
in
the
graveyard
an
not
only
seen
it
but
he
knew
who
the
spook
was
an
all
about
him
we
was
gittin
some
serious
ourselves
an
made
him
tell

sir
eger
sir
grahame
and
sir
on
the
summit
of
one
of
the
heights
of
the
odenwald
a
wild
and
romantic
tract
of
upper
germany
that
lies
not
far
from
the
confluence
of
the
main
and
the
rhine
there
stood
many
many
years
since
the
castle
of
the
baron
von
landshort
it
is
now
quite
fallen
to
decay
and
almost
buried
among
beech
trees
and
dark
firs
above
which
however
its
old
watch
tower
may
still
be
seen
struggling
like
the
former
possessor
i
have
mentioned
to
carry
a
high
head
and
look
down
upon
the
neighboring
country
the
baron
was
a
dry
branch
of
the
great
family
of
katzenellenbogen
and
inherited
the
relics
of
the
property
and
all
the
pride
of
his
ancestors
though
the
warlike
disposition
of
his
predecessors
had
much
impaired
the
family
possessions
yet
the
baron
still
endeavored
to
keep
up
some
show
of
former
state
the
times
were
peaceable
and
the
german
nobles
in
general
had
abandoned
their
inconvenient
old
castles
perched
like
eagles
nests
among
the
mountains
and
had
built
more
convenient
residences
in
the
valleys
still
the
baron
remained
proudly
drawn
up
in
his
little
fortress
cherishing
with
hereditary
inveteracy
all
the
old
family
feuds
so
that
he
was
on
ill
terms
with
some
of
his
nearest
neighbors
on
account
of
disputes
that
had
happened
between
their
the
baron
had
but
one
child
a
daughter
but
nature
when
she
grants
but
one
child
always
compensates
by
making
it
a
prodigy
and
so
it
was
with
the
daughter
of
the
baron
all
the
nurses
gossips
and
country
cousins
assured
her
father
that
she
had
not
her
equal
for
beauty
in
all
germany
and
who
should
know
better
than
they
she
had
moreover
been
brought
up
with
great
care
under
the
superintendence
of
two
maiden
aunts
who
had
spent
some
years
of
their
early
life
at
one
of
the
little
german
courts
and
were
skilled
in
all
branches
of
knowledge
necessary
to
the
education
of
a
fine
lady
under
their
instructions
she
became
a
miracle
of
accomplishments
by
the
time
she
was
eighteen
she
could
embroider
to
admiration
and
had
worked
whole
histories
of
the
saints
in
tapestry
with
such
strength
of
expression
in
their
countenances
that
they
looked
like
so
many
souls
in
purgatory
she
could
read
without
great
difficulty
and
had
spelled
her
way
through
several
church
legends
and
almost
all
the
chivalric
wonders
of
the
heldenbuch
she
had
even
made
considerable
proficiency
in
writing
could
sign
her
own
name
without
missing
a
letter
and
so
legibly
that
her
aunts
could
read
it
without
spectacles
she
excelled
in
making
little
elegant
nicknacks
of
all
kinds
was
versed
in
the
most
abstruse
dancing
of
the
day
played
a
number
of
airs
on
the
harp
and
guitar
and
knew
all
the
tender
ballads
of
the
minnelieders
by
heart
her
aunts
too
having
been
great
flirts
and
coquettes
in
their
younger
days
were
admirably
calculated
to
be
vigilant
guardians
and
strict
censors
of
the
conduct
of
their
niece
for
there
is
no
duenna
so
rigidly
prudent
and
inexorably
decorous
as
a
superannuated
coquette
she
was
rarely
suffered
out
of
their
sight
never
went
beyond
the
domains
of
the
castle
unless
well
attended
or
rather
well
watched
had
continual
lectures
read
to
her
about
strict
decorum
and
implicit
obedience
and
as
to
the
men
pah
she
was
taught
to
hold
them
at
such
a
distance
and
in
such
absolute
distrust
that
unless
properly
authorized
she
would
not
have
cast
a
glance
upon
the
handsomest
cavalier
in
the
world
no
not
if
he
were
even
dying
at
her
feet
the
good
effects
of
this
system
were
wonderfully
apparent
the
young
lady
was
a
pattern
of
docility
and
correctness
while
others
were
wasting
their
sweetness
in
the
glare
of
the
world
and
liable
to
be
plucked
and
thrown
aside
by
every
hand
she
was
coyly
blooming
into
fresh
and
lovely
womanhood
under
the
protection
of
those
immaculate
spinsters
like
a
rosebud
blushing
forth
among
guardian
thorns
her
aunts
looked
upon
her
with
pride
and
exultation
and
vaunted
that
though
all
the
other
young
ladies
in
the
world
might
go
astray
yet
thank
heaven
nothing
of
the
kind
could
happen
to
the
heiress
of
katzenellenbogen
but
however
scantily
the
baron
von
landshort
might
be
provided
with
children
his
household
was
by
no
means
a
small
one
for
providence
had
enriched
him
with
abundance
of
poor
relations
they
one
and
all
possessed
the
affectionate
disposition
common
to
humble
relatives
were
wonderfully
attached
to
the
baron
and
took
every
possible
occasion
to
come
in
swarms
and
enliven
the
castle
all
family
festivals
were
commemorated
by
these
good
people
at
the
baron
expense
and
when
they
were
filled
with
good
cheer
they
would
declare
that
there
was
nothing
on
earth
so
delightful
as
these
family
meetings
these
jubilees
of
the
heart
the
baron
though
a
small
man
had
a
large
soul
and
it
swelled
with
satisfaction
at
the
consciousness
of
being
the
greatest
man
in
the
little
world
about
him
he
loved
to
tell
long
stories
about
the
dark
old
warriors
whose
portraits
looked
grimly
down
from
the
walls
around
and
he
found
no
listeners
equal
to
those
that
fed
at
his
expense
he
was
much
given
to
the
marvelous
and
a
firm
believer
in
all
those
supernatural
tales
with
which
every
mountain
and
valley
in
germany
abounds
the
faith
of
his
guests
exceeded
even
his
own
they
listened
to
every
tale
of
wonder
with
open
eyes
and
mouth
and
never
failed
to
be
astonished
even
though
repeated
for
the
hundredth
time
thus
lived
the
baron
von
landshort
the
oracle
of
his
table
the
absolute
monarch
of
his
little
territory
and
happy
above
all
things
in
the
persuasion
that
he
was
the
wisest
man
of
the
age
at
the
time
of
which
my
story
treats
there
was
a
great
family
gathering
at
the
castle
on
an
affair
of
the
utmost
importance
it
was
to
receive
the
destined
bridegroom
of
the
baron
daughter
a
negotiation
had
been
carried
on
between
the
father
and
an
old
nobleman
of
bavaria
to
unite
the
dignity
of
their
houses
by
the
marriage
of
their
children
the
preliminaries
had
been
conducted
with
proper
punctilio
the
young
people
were
betrothed
without
seeing
each
other
and
the
time
was
appointed
for
the
marriage
ceremony
the
young
count
von
altenburg
had
been
recalled
from
the
army
for
the
purpose
and
was
actually
on
his
way
to
the
baron
to
receive
his
bride

had
even
been
received
from
him
from
wurtzburg
where
he
was
accidentally
detained
mentioning
the
day
and
hour
when
he
might
be
expected
to
arrive
the
castle
was
in
a
tumult
of
preparation
to
give
him
a
suitable
welcome
the
fair
bride
had
been
decked
out
with
uncommon
care
the
two
aunts
had
superintended
her
toilet
and
quarreled
the
whole
morning
about
every
article
of
her
dress
the
young
lady
had
taken
advantage
of
their
contest
to
follow
the
bent
of
her
own
taste
and
fortunately
it
was
a
good
one
she
looked
as
lovely
as
youthful
bridegroom
could
desire
and
the
flutter
of
expectation
heightened
the
luster
of
her
charms
the
suffusions
that
mantled
her
face
and
neck
the
gentle
heaving
of
the
bosom
the
eye
now
and
then
lost
in
reverie
all
betrayed
the
soft
tumult
that
was
going
on
in
her
little
heart
the
aunts
were
continually
hovering
around
her
for
maiden
aunts
are
apt
to
take
great
interest
in
affairs
of
this
nature
they
were
giving
her
a
world
of
staid
counsel
how
to
deport
herself
what
to
say
and
in
what
manner
to
receive
the
expected
lover
the
baron
was
no
less
busied
in
preparations
he
had
in
truth
nothing
exactly
to
do
but
he
was
naturally
a
fuming
bustling
little
man
and
could
not
remain
passive
when
all
the
world
was
in
a
hurry
he
worried
from
top
to
bottom
of
the
castle
with
an
air
of
infinite
anxiety
he
continually
called
the
servants
from
their
work
to
exhort
them
to
be
diligent
and
buzzed
about
every
hall
and
chamber
as
idly
restless
and
importunate
as
a
fly
on
a
warm
summer
day
in
the
meantime
the
fatted
calf
had
been
killed
the
forests
had
rung
with
the
clamor
of
the
huntsmen
the
kitchen
was
crowded
with
good
cheer
the
cellars
had
yielded
up
whole
oceans
of
and
and
even
the
great
heidelberg
tun
had
been
laid
under
contribution
everything
was
ready
to
receive
the
distinguished
guest
with
und
in
the
true
spirit
of
german
hospitality
but
the
guest
delayed
to
make
his
appearance
hour
rolled
after
hour
the
sun
that
had
poured
his
downward
rays
upon
the
rich
forest
of
the
odenwald
now
just
gleamed
along
the
summits
of
the
mountains
the
baron
mounted
the
highest
tower
and
strained
his
eyes
in
hope
of
catching
a
distant
sight
of
the
count
and
his
attendants
once
he
thought
he
beheld
them
the
sounds
of
horns
came
floating
from
the
valley
prolonged
by
the
mountain
echoes
a
number
of
horsemen
were
seen
far
below
slowly
advancing
along
the
road
but
when
they
had
nearly
reached
the
foot
of
the
mountain
they
suddenly
struck
off
in
a
different
direction
the
last
ray
of
sunshine
departed
the
bats
began
to
flit
by
in
the
twilight
the
road
grew
dimmer
and
dimmer
to
the
view
and
nothing
appeared
stirring
in
it
but
now
and
then
a
peasant
lagging
homeward
from
his
labor
while
the
old
castle
at
landshort
was
in
this
state
of
perplexity
a
very
interesting
scene
was
transacting
in
a
different
part
of
the
odenwald
the
young
count
von
altenburg
was
tranquilly
pursuing
his
route
in
that
sober
way
in
which
a
man
travels
toward
matrimony
when
his
friends
have
taken
all
the
trouble
and
uncertainty
of
courtship
off
his
hands
and
a
bride
is
waiting
for
him
as
certainly
as
a
dinner
at
the
end
of
his
journey
he
had
encountered
at
wurtzburg
a
youthful
companion
in
arms
with
whom
he
had
seen
some
service
on
the
frontiers
herman
von
starkenfaust
one
of
the
stoutest
hands
and
worthiest
hearts
of
german
chivalry
who
was
now
returning
from
the
army
his
father
castle
was
not
far
distant
from
the
old
fortress
of
landshort
although
an
hereditary
feud
rendered
the
families
hostile
and
strangers
to
each
other
in
the
moment
of
recognition
the
young
friends
related
all
their
past
adventures
and
fortunes
and
the
count
gave
the
whole
history
of
his
intended
nuptials
with
a
young
lady
whom
he
had
never
seen
but
of
whose
charms
he
had
received
the
most
enrapturing
descriptions
as
the
route
of
the
friends
lay
in
the
same
direction
they
agreed
to
perform
the
rest
of
their
journey
together
and
that
they
might
do
it
the
more
leisurely
set
off
from
wurtzburg
at
an
early
hour
the
count
having
given
directions
for
his
retinue
to
follow
and
overtake
him
they
beguiled
their
wayfaring
with
recollections
of
their
military
scenes
and
adventures
but
the
count
was
apt
to
be
a
little
tedious
now
and
then
about
the
reputed
charms
of
his
bride
and
the
felicity
that
awaited
him
in
this
way
they
had
entered
among
the
mountains
of
the
odenwald
and
were
traversing
one
of
its
most
lonely
and
thickly
wooded
passes
it
is
well
known
that
the
forests
of
germany
have
always
been
as
much
infested
by
robbers
as
its
castles
by
specters
and
at
this
time
the
former
were
particularly
numerous
from
the
hordes
of
disbanded
soldiers
wandering
about
the
country
it
will
not
appear
extraordinary
therefore
that
the
cavaliers
were
attacked
by
a
gang
of
these
stragglers
in
the
midst
of
the
forest
they
defended
themselves
with
bravery
but
were
nearly
overpowered
when
the
count
retinue
arrived
to
their
assistance
at
sight
of
them
the
robbers
fled
but
not
until
the
count
had
received
a
mortal
wound
he
was
slowly
and
carefully
conveyed
back
to
the
city
of
wurtzburg
and
a
friar
summoned
from
a
neighboring
convent
who
was
famous
for
his
skill
in
administering
to
both
soul
and
body
but
half
of
his
skill
was
superfluous
the
moments
of
the
unfortunate
count
were
numbered
with
his
dying
breath
he
entreated
his
friend
to
repair
instantly
to
the
castle
of
landshort
and
explain
the
fatal
cause
of
his
not
keeping
his
appointment
with
his
bride
though
not
the
most
ardent
of
lovers
he
was
one
of
the
most
punctilious
of
men
and
appeared
earnestly
solicitous
that
his
mission
should
be
speedily
and
courteously
executed
unless
this
is
done
said
he
i
shall
not
sleep
quietly
in
my
grave
he
repeated
these
last
words
with
peculiar
solemnity
a
request
at
a
moment
so
impressive
admitted
no
hesitation
starkenfaust
endeavored
to
soothe
him
to
calmness
promised
faithfully
to
execute
his
wish
and
gave
him
his
hand
in
solemn
pledge
the
dying
man
pressed
it
in
acknowledgment
but
soon
lapsed
into
delirium
raved
about
his
bride
his
engagements
his
plighted
word
ordered
his
horse
that
he
might
ride
to
the
castle
of
landshort
and
expired
in
the
fancied
act
of
vaulting
into
the
saddle
starkenfaust
bestowed
a
sigh
and
a
soldier
tear
on
the
untimely
fate
of
his
comrade
and
then
pondered
on
the
awkward
mission
he
had
undertaken
his
heart
was
heavy
and
his
head
perplexed
for
he
was
to
present
himself
an
unbidden
guest
among
hostile
people
and
to
damp
their
festivity
with
tidings
fatal
to
their
hopes
still
there
were
certain
whisperings
of
curiosity
in
his
bosom
to
see
this
beauty
of
katzenellenbogen
so
cautiously
shut
up
from
the
world
for
he
was
a
passionate
admirer
of
the
sex
and
there
was
a
dash
of
eccentricity
and
enterprise
in
his
character
that
made
him
fond
of
all
singular
adventure
previous
to
his
departure
he
made
all
due
arrangements
with
the
holy
fraternity
of
the
convent
for
the
funeral
solemnities
of
his
friend
who
was
to
be
buried
in
the
cathedral
of
wurtzburg
near
some
of
his
illustrious
relatives
and
the
mourning
retinue
of
the
count
took
charge
of
his
remains
it
is
now
high
time
that
we
should
return
to
the
ancient
family
of
katzenellenbogen
who
were
impatient
for
their
guest
and
still
more
for
their
dinner
and
to
the
worthy
little
baron
whom
we
left
airing
himself
on
the
night
closed
in
but
still
no
guest
arrived
the
baron
descended
from
the
tower
in
despair
the
banquet
which
had
been
delayed
from
hour
to
hour
could
no
longer
be
postponed
the
meats
were
already
overdone
the
cook
in
an
agony
and
the
whole
household
had
the
look
of
a
garrison
that
had
been
reduced
by
famine
the
baron
was
obliged
reluctantly
to
give
orders
for
the
feast
without
the
presence
of
the
guest
all
were
seated
at
table
and
just
on
the
point
of
commencing
when
the
sound
of
a
horn
from
without
the
gate
gave
notice
of
the
approach
of
a
stranger
another
long
blast
filled
the
old
courts
of
the
castle
with
its
echoes
and
was
answered
by
the
warder
from
the
walls
the
baron
hastened
to
receive
his
future
the
drawbridge
had
been
let
down
and
the
stranger
was
before
the
gate
he
was
a
tall
gallant
cavalier
mounted
on
a
black
steed
his
countenance
was
pale
but
he
had
a
beaming
romantic
eye
and
an
air
of
stately
melancholy
the
baron
was
a
little
mortified
that
he
should
have
come
in
this
simple
solitary
style
his
dignity
for
a
moment
was
ruffled
and
he
felt
disposed
to
consider
it
a
want
of
proper
respect
for
the
important
occasion
and
the
important
family
with
which
he
was
to
be
connected
he
pacified
himself
however
with
the
conclusion
that
it
must
have
been
youthful
impatience
which
had
induced
him
thus
to
spur
on
sooner
than
his
attendants
i
am
sorry
said
the
stranger
to
break
in
upon
you
thus
unseasonably
here
the
baron
interrupted
with
a
world
of
compliments
and
greetings
for
to
tell
the
truth
he
prided
himself
upon
his
courtesy
and
eloquence
the
stranger
attempted
once
or
twice
to
stem
the
torrent
of
words
but
in
vain
so
he
bowed
his
head
and
suffered
it
to
flow
on
by
the
time
the
baron
had
come
to
a
pause
they
had
reached
the
inner
court
of
the
castle
and
the
stranger
was
again
about
to
speak
when
he
was
once
more
interrupted
by
the
appearance
of
the
female
part
of
the
family
leading
forth
the
shrinking
and
blushing
bride
he
gazed
on
her
for
a
moment
as
one
entranced
it
seemed
as
if
his
whole
soul
beamed
forth
in
the
gaze
and
rested
upon
that
lovely
form
one
of
the
maiden
aunts
whispered
something
in
her
ear
she
made
an
effort
to
speak
her
moist
blue
eye
was
timidly
raised
gave
a
shy
glance
of
inquiry
on
the
stranger
and
was
cast
again
to
the
ground
the
words
died
away
but
there
was
a
sweet
smile
playing
about
her
lips
and
a
soft
dimpling
of
the
cheek
that
showed
her
glance
had
not
been
unsatisfactory
it
was
impossible
for
a
girl
of
the
fond
age
of
eighteen
highly
predisposed
for
love
and
matrimony
not
to
be
pleased
with
so
gallant
a
cavalier
the
late
hour
at
which
the
guest
had
arrived
left
no
time
for
parley
the
baron
was
peremptory
and
deferred
all
particular
conversation
until
the
morning
and
led
the
way
to
the
untasted
banquet
it
was
served
up
in
the
great
hall
of
the
castle
around
the
walls
hung
the
portraits
of
the
heroes
of
the
house
of
katzenellenbogen
and
the
trophies
which
they
had
gained
in
the
field
and
in
the
chase
hacked
corselets
splintered
jousting
spears
and
tattered
banners
were
mingled
with
the
spoils
of
sylvan
warfare
the
jaws
of
the
wolf
and
the
tusks
of
the
boar
grinned
horribly
among
and
and
a
huge
pair
of
antlers
branched
immediately
over
the
head
of
the
youthful
bridegroom
the
cavalier
took
but
little
notice
of
the
company
or
the
entertainment
he
scarcely
tasted
the
banquet
but
seemed
absorbed
in
admiration
of
his
bride
he
conversed
in
a
low
tone
that
could
not
be
overheard
for
the
language
of
love
is
never
loud
but
where
is
the
female
ear
so
dull
that
it
can
not
catch
the
softest
whisper
of
the
lover
there
was
a
mingled
tenderness
and
gravity
in
his
manner
that
appeared
to
have
a
powerful
effect
upon
the
young
lady
her
color
came
and
went
as
she
listened
with
deep
attention
now
and
then
she
made
some
blushing
reply
and
when
his
eye
was
turned
away
she
would
steal
a
sidelong
glance
at
his
romantic
countenance
and
heave
a
gentle
sigh
of
tender
happiness
it
was
evident
that
the
young
couple
were
completely
enamored
the
aunts
who
were
deeply
versed
in
the
mysteries
of
the
heart
declared
that
they
had
fallen
in
love
with
each
other
at
first
sight
the
feast
went
on
merrily
or
at
least
noisily
for
the
guests
were
all
blessed
with
those
keen
appetites
that
attend
upon
light
purses
and
mountain
air
the
baron
told
his
best
and
longest
stories
and
never
had
he
told
them
so
well
or
with
such
great
effect
if
there
was
anything
marvelous
his
auditors
were
lost
in
astonishment
and
if
anything
facetious
they
were
sure
to
laugh
exactly
in
the
right
place
the
baron
it
is
true
like
most
great
men
was
too
dignified
to
utter
any
joke
but
a
dull
one
it
was
always
enforced
however
by
a
bumper
of
excellent
hockheimer
and
even
a
dull
joke
at
one
own
table
served
up
with
jolly
old
wine
is
irresistible
many
good
things
were
said
by
poorer
and
keener
wits
that
would
not
bear
repeating
except
on
similar
occasions
many
sly
speeches
whispered
in
ladies
ears
that
almost
convulsed
them
with
suppressed
laughter
and
a
song
or
two
roared
out
by
a
poor
but
merry
and
cousin
of
the
baron
that
absolutely
made
the
maiden
aunts
hold
up
their
fans
amidst
all
this
revelry
the
stranger
guest
maintained
a
most
singular
and
unseasonable
gravity
his
countenance
assumed
a
deeper
cast
of
dejection
as
the
evening
advanced
and
strange
as
it
may
appear
even
the
baron
jokes
seemed
only
to
render
him
the
more
melancholy
at
times
he
was
lost
in
thought
and
at
times
there
was
a
perturbed
and
restless
wandering
of
the
eye
that
bespoke
a
mind
but
ill
at
ease
his
conversations
with
the
bride
became
more
and
more
earnest
and
mysterious
lowering
clouds
began
to
steal
over
the
fair
serenity
of
her
brow
and
tremors
to
run
through
her
tender
frame
all
this
could
not
escape
the
notice
of
the
company
their
gayety
was
chilled
by
the
unaccountable
gloom
of
the
bridegroom
their
spirits
were
infected
whispers
and
glances
were
interchanged
accompanied
by
shrugs
and
dubious
shakes
of
the
head
the
song
and
the
laugh
grew
less
and
less
frequent
there
were
dreary
pauses
in
the
conversation
which
were
at
length
succeeded
by
wild
tales
and
supernatural
legends
one
dismal
story
produced
another
still
more
dismal
and
the
baron
nearly
frightened
some
of
the
ladies
into
hysterics
with
the
history
of
the
goblin
horseman
that
carried
away
the
fair
leonora
a
dreadful
story
which
has
since
been
put
into
excellent
verse
and
is
read
and
believed
by
all
the
world
the
bridegroom
listened
to
this
tale
with
profound
attention
he
kept
his
eyes
steadily
fixed
on
the
baron
and
as
the
story
drew
to
a
close
began
gradually
to
rise
from
his
seat
growing
taller
and
taller
until
in
the
baron
entranced
eye
he
seemed
almost
to
tower
into
a
giant
the
moment
the
tale
was
finished
he
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
took
a
solemn
farewell
of
the
company
they
were
all
amazement
the
baron
was
perfectly
what
going
to
leave
the
castle
at
midnight
why
everything
was
prepared
for
his
reception
a
chamber
was
ready
for
him
if
he
wished
to
retire
the
stranger
shook
his
head
mournfully
and
mysteriously
i
must
lay
my
head
in
a
different
chamber
there
was
something
in
this
reply
and
the
tone
in
which
it
was
uttered
that
made
the
baron
heart
misgive
him
but
he
rallied
his
forces
and
repeated
his
hospitable
entreaties
the
stranger
shook
his
head
silently
but
positively
at
every
offer
and
waving
his
farewell
to
the
company
stalked
slowly
out
of
the
hall
the
maiden
aunts
were
absolutely
petrified
the
bride
hung
her
head
and
a
tear
stole
to
her
eye
the
baron
followed
the
stranger
to
the
great
court
of
the
castle
where
the
black
charger
stood
pawing
the
earth
and
snorting
with
impatience
when
they
had
reached
the
portal
whose
deep
archway
was
dimly
lighted
by
a
cresset
the
stranger
paused
and
addressed
the
baron
in
a
hollow
tone
of
voice
which
the
vaulted
roof
rendered
still
more
sepulchral
now
that
we
are
alone
said
he
i
will
impart
to
you
the
reason
of
my
going
i
have
a
solemn
an
indispensable
engagement
why
said
the
baron
can
not
you
send
someone
in
your
place
it
admits
of
no
substitute
i
must
attend
it
in
person
i
must
away
to
wurtzburg
cathedral
ay
said
the
baron
plucking
up
spirit
but
not
until
you
shall
take
your
bride
there
no
no
replied
the
stranger
with
tenfold
solemnity
my
engagement
is
with
no
bride
the
worms
the
worms
expect
me
i
am
a
dead
man
i
have
been
slain
by
robbers
my
body
lies
at
wurtzburg
at
midnight
i
am
to
be
buried
the
grave
is
waiting
for
me
i
must
keep
my
appointment
he
sprang
on
his
black
charger
dashed
over
the
drawbridge
and
the
clattering
of
his
horses
hoofs
was
lost
in
the
whistling
of
the
night
blast
the
baron
returned
to
the
hall
in
the
utmost
consternation
and
related
what
had
passed
two
ladies
fainted
outright
others
sickened
at
the
idea
of
having
banqueted
with
a
specter
it
was
the
opinion
of
some
that
this
might
be
the
wild
huntsman
famous
in
german
legend
some
talked
of
mountain
sprites
of
and
of
other
supernatural
beings
with
which
the
good
people
of
germany
have
been
so
grievously
harassed
since
time
immemorial
one
of
the
poor
relations
ventured
to
suggest
that
it
might
be
some
sportive
evasion
of
the
young
cavalier
and
that
the
very
gloominess
of
the
caprice
seemed
to
accord
with
so
melancholy
a
personage
this
however
drew
on
him
the
indignation
of
the
whole
company
and
especially
of
the
baron
who
looked
upon
him
as
little
better
than
an
infidel
so
that
he
was
fain
to
abjure
his
heresy
as
speedily
as
possible
and
come
into
the
faith
of
the
true
believers
but
whatever
may
have
been
the
doubts
entertained
they
were
completely
put
to
an
end
by
the
arrival
next
day
of
regular
missives
confirming
the
intelligence
of
the
young
count
murder
and
his
interment
in
wurtzburg
cathedral
the
dismay
at
the
castle
may
well
be
imagined
the
baron
shut
himself
up
in
his
chamber
the
guests
who
had
come
to
rejoice
with
him
could
not
think
of
abandoning
him
in
his
distress
they
wandered
about
the
courts
or
collected
in
groups
in
the
hall
shaking
their
heads
and
shrugging
their
shoulders
at
the
troubles
of
so
good
a
man
and
sat
longer
than
ever
at
table
and
ate
and
drank
more
stoutly
than
ever
by
way
of
keeping
up
their
spirits
but
the
situation
of
the
widowed
bride
was
the
most
pitiable
to
have
lost
a
husband
before
she
had
even
embraced
him
and
such
a
husband
if
the
very
specter
could
be
so
gracious
and
noble
what
must
have
been
the
living
man
she
filled
the
house
with
lamentations
on
the
night
of
the
second
day
of
her
widowhood
she
had
retired
to
her
chamber
accompanied
by
one
of
her
aunts
who
insisted
on
sleeping
with
her
the
aunt
who
was
one
of
the
best
tellers
of
ghost
stories
in
all
germany
had
just
been
recounting
one
of
her
longest
and
had
fallen
asleep
in
the
very
midst
of
it
the
chamber
was
remote
and
overlooked
a
small
garden
the
niece
lay
pensively
gazing
at
the
beams
of
the
rising
moon
as
they
trembled
on
the
leaves
of
an
before
the
lattice
the
had
just
tolled
midnight
when
a
soft
strain
of
music
stole
up
from
the
garden
she
rose
hastily
from
her
bed
and
stepped
lightly
to
the
window
a
tall
figure
stood
among
the
shadows
of
the
trees
as
it
raised
its
head
a
beam
of
moonlight
fell
upon
the
countenance
heaven
and
earth
she
beheld
the
specter
bridegroom
a
loud
shriek
at
that
moment
burst
upon
her
ear
and
her
aunt
who
had
been
awakened
by
the
music
and
had
followed
her
silently
to
the
window
fell
into
her
arms
when
she
looked
again
the
specter
had
disappeared
of
the
two
females
the
aunt
now
required
the
most
soothing
for
she
was
perfectly
beside
herself
with
terror
as
to
the
young
lady
there
was
something
even
in
the
specter
of
her
lover
that
seemed
endearing
there
was
still
the
semblance
of
manly
beauty
and
though
the
shadow
of
a
man
is
but
little
calculated
to
satisfy
the
affections
of
a
girl
yet
where
the
substance
is
not
to
be
had
even
that
is
consoling
the
aunt
declared
she
would
never
sleep
in
that
chamber
again
the
niece
for
once
was
refractory
and
declared
as
strongly
that
she
would
sleep
in
no
other
in
the
castle
the
consequence
was
that
she
had
to
sleep
in
it
alone
but
she
drew
a
promise
from
her
aunt
not
to
relate
the
story
of
the
specter
lest
she
should
be
denied
the
only
melancholy
pleasure
left
her
on
earth
that
of
inhabiting
the
chamber
over
which
the
guardian
shade
of
her
lover
kept
its
nightly
vigils
how
long
the
good
old
lady
would
have
observed
this
promise
is
uncertain
for
she
dearly
loved
to
talk
of
the
marvelous
and
there
is
a
triumph
in
being
the
first
to
tell
a
frightful
story
it
is
however
still
quoted
in
the
neighborhood
as
a
memorable
instance
of
female
secrecy
that
she
kept
it
to
herself
for
a
whole
week
when
she
was
suddenly
absolved
from
all
further
restraint
by
intelligence
brought
to
the
breakfast
table
one
morning
that
the
young
lady
was
not
to
be
found
her
room
was
empty
the
bed
had
not
been
slept
in
the
window
was
open
and
the
bird
had
flown
the
astonishment
and
concern
with
which
the
intelligence
was
received
can
only
be
imagined
by
those
who
have
witnessed
the
agitation
which
the
mishaps
of
a
great
man
cause
among
his
friends
even
the
poor
relations
paused
for
a
moment
from
the
indefatigable
labors
of
the
trencher
when
the
aunt
who
had
at
first
been
struck
speechless
wrung
her
hands
and
shrieked
out
the
goblin
the
goblin
she
carried
away
by
the
goblin
in
a
few
words
she
related
the
fearful
scene
of
the
garden
and
concluded
that
the
specter
must
have
carried
off
his
bride
two
of
the
domestics
corroborated
the
opinion
for
they
had
heard
the
clattering
of
a
horse
hoofs
down
the
mountain
about
midnight
and
had
no
doubt
that
it
was
the
specter
on
his
black
charger
bearing
her
away
to
the
tomb
all
present
were
struck
with
the
direful
probability
for
events
of
the
kind
are
extremely
common
in
germany
as
many
histories
bear
witness
what
a
lamentable
situation
was
that
of
the
poor
baron
what
a
dilemma
for
a
fond
father
and
a
member
of
the
great
family
of
katzenellenbogen
his
only
daughter
had
either
been
rapt
away
to
the
grave
or
he
was
to
have
some
for
a
and
perchance
a
troop
of
goblin
grandchildren
as
usual
he
was
completely
bewildered
and
all
the
castle
in
an
uproar
the
men
were
ordered
to
take
horse
and
scour
every
road
and
path
and
glen
of
the
odenwald
the
baron
himself
had
just
drawn
on
his
girded
on
his
sword
and
was
about
to
mount
his
steed
to
sally
forth
on
the
doubtful
quest
when
he
was
brought
to
a
pause
by
a
new
apparition
a
lady
was
seen
approaching
the
castle
mounted
on
a
palfrey
attended
by
a
cavalier
on
horseback
she
galloped
up
to
the
gate
sprang
from
her
horse
and
falling
at
the
baron
feet
embraced
his
knees
it
was
his
lost
daughter
and
her
companion
the
specter
bridegroom
the
baron
was
astounded
he
looked
at
his
daughter
then
at
the
specter
and
almost
doubted
the
evidence
of
his
senses
the
latter
too
was
wonderfully
improved
in
his
appearance
since
his
visit
to
the
world
of
spirits
his
dress
was
splendid
and
set
off
a
noble
figure
of
manly
symmetry
he
was
no
longer
pale
and
melancholy
his
fine
countenance
was
flushed
with
the
glow
of
youth
and
joy
rioted
in
his
large
dark
eye
the
mystery
was
soon
cleared
up
the
cavalier
for
in
truth
as
you
must
have
known
all
the
while
he
was
no
goblin
announced
himself
as
sir
herman
von
starkenfaust
he
related
his
adventure
with
the
young
count
he
told
how
he
had
hastened
to
the
castle
to
deliver
the
unwelcome
tidings
but
that
the
eloquence
of
the
baron
had
interrupted
him
in
every
attempt
to
tell
his
tale
how
the
sight
of
the
bride
had
completely
captivated
him
and
that
to
pass
a
few
hours
near
her
he
had
tacitly
suffered
the
mistake
to
continue
how
he
had
been
sorely
perplexed
in
what
way
to
make
a
decent
retreat
until
the
baron
goblin
stories
had
suggested
his
eccentric
exit
how
fearing
the
feudal
hostility
of
the
family
he
had
repeated
his
visits
by
stealth
had
haunted
the
garden
beneath
the
young
lady
window
had
wooed
had
won
had
borne
away
in
triumph
and
in
a
word
had
wedded
the
fair
under
any
other
circumstances
the
baron
would
have
been
inflexible
for
he
was
tenacious
of
paternal
authority
and
devoutly
obstinate
in
all
family
feuds
but
he
loved
his
daughter
he
had
lamented
her
as
lost
he
rejoiced
to
find
her
still
alive
and
though
her
husband
was
of
a
hostile
house
yet
thank
heaven
he
was
not
a
goblin
there
was
something
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
did
not
exactly
accord
with
his
notions
of
strict
veracity
in
the
joke
the
knight
had
passed
upon
him
of
his
being
a
dead
man
but
several
old
friends
present
who
had
served
in
the
wars
assured
him
that
every
stratagem
was
excusable
in
love
and
that
the
cavalier
was
entitled
to
especial
privilege
having
lately
served
as
a
trooper
matters
therefore
were
happily
arranged
the
baron
pardoned
the
young
couple
on
the
spot
the
revels
at
the
castle
were
resumed
the
poor
relations
overwhelmed
this
new
member
of
the
family
with
loving
kindness
he
was
so
gallant
so
generous
and
so
rich
the
aunts
it
is
true
were
somewhat
scandalized
that
their
system
of
strict
seclusion
and
passive
obedience
should
be
so
badly
exemplified
but
attributed
it
all
to
their
negligence
in
not
having
the
windows
grated
one
of
them
was
particularly
mortified
at
having
her
marvelous
story
marred
and
that
the
only
specter
she
had
ever
seen
should
turn
out
a
counterfeit
but
the
niece
seemed
perfectly
happy
at
having
found
him
substantial
flesh
and
blood
and
so
the
story
ends
footnotes
the
erudite
reader
well
versed
in
lore
will
perceive
that
the
above
tale
must
have
been
suggested
to
the
old
swiss
by
a
little
french
anecdote
a
circumstance
said
to
have
taken
place
at
paris
the
name
of
a
family
of
those
parts
very
powerful
in
former
times
the
appellation
we
are
told
was
given
in
compliment
to
a
peerless
dame
of
the
family
celebrated
for
her
fine
arm

specter

it
is
very
odd
though
what
can
have
become
of
them
said
charles
seaforth
as
he
peeped
under
the
valance
of
an
bedstead
in
an
apartment
of
a

confoundedly
odd

i

make

out
at
all
why
barney
where
are
they
and
where
the
d
l
are
you
no
answer
was
returned
to
this
appeal
and
the
lieutenant
who
was
in
the
main
a
reasonable
person
at
least
as
reasonable
a
person
as
any
young
gentleman
of
in
the
service
can
fairly
be
expected
to
be
cooled
when
he
reflected
that
his
servant
could
scarcely
reply
extempore
to
a
summons
which
it
was
impossible
he
should
hear
an
application
to
the
bell
was
the
considerate
result
and
the
footsteps
of
as
tight
a
lad
as
ever
put
to
belt
sounded
along
the
gallery
come
in
said
his
master
an
ineffectual
attempt
upon
the
door
reminded
seaforth
that
he
had
locked
himself
in
by
heaven
this
is
the
oddest
thing
of
all
said
he
as
he
turned
the
key
and
admitted
maguire
into
his
dormitory
barney
where
are
my
pantaloons
is
it
the
breeches
asked
the
valet
casting
an
inquiring
eye
round
the
apartment
is
it
the
breeches
sir
yes
what
have
you
done
with
them
sure
then
your
honor
had
them
on
when
you
went
to
bed
and
hereabouts
they
be
i
be
bail
and
barney
lifted
a
fashionable
tunic
from
a
proceeding
in
his
examination
but
the
search
was
vain
there
was
the
tunic
aforesaid
there
was
a
kerseymere
waistcoat
but
the
most
important
article
of
all
in
a
gentleman
wardrobe
was
still
wanting
where
they
be
asked
the
master
with
a
strong
accent
on
the
auxiliary
verb
sorrow
a
know
i
knows
said
the
man
it
have
been
the
devil
then
after
all
who
has
been
here
and
carried
them
off
cried
seaforth
staring
full
into
barney
face
maguire
was
not
devoid
of
the
superstition
of
his
countrymen
still
he
looked
as
if
he
did
not
quite
subscribe
to
the
his
master
read
incredulity
in
his
countenance
why
i
tell
you
barney
i
put
them
there
on
that
when
i
got
into
bed
and
by
heaven
i
distinctly
saw
the
ghost
of
the
old
fellow
they
told
me
of
come
in
at
midnight
put
on
my
pantaloons
and
walk
away
with
them
may
be
so
was
the
cautious
reply
i
thought
of
course
it
was
a
dream
but
then
where
the
d
l
are
the
breeches
the
question
was
more
easily
asked
than
answered
barney
renewed
his
search
while
the
lieutenant
folded
his
arms
and
leaning
against
the
toilet
sunk
into
a
reverie
after
all
it
must
be
some
trick
of
my
cousins
said
seaforth
ah
then
the
ladies
chimed
in
maguire
though
the
observation
was
not
addressed
to
him
and
will
it
be
miss
caroline
or
miss
fanny
that
stole
your
honor
things
i
hardly
know
what
to
think
of
it
pursued
the
bereaved
lieutenant
still
speaking
in
soliloquy
with
his
eye
resting
dubiously
on
the
i
locked
myself
in
that
certain
and
but
there
must
be
some
other
entrance
to
the
room
pooh
i
remember
the
private
staircase
how
could
i
be
such
a
fool
and
he
crossed
the
chamber
to
where
a
low
oaken
doorcase
was
dimly
visible
in
a
distant
corner
he
paused
before
it
nothing
now
interfered
to
screen
it
from
observation
but
it
bore
tokens
of
having
been
at
some
earlier
period
concealed
by
tapestry
remains
of
which
yet
clothed
the
walls
on
either
side
the
portal
this
way
they
must
have
come
said
seaforth
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
i
had
caught
them
och
the
kittens
sighed
barney
maguire
but
the
mystery
was
yet
as
far
from
being
solved
as
before
true
there
the
other
door
but
then
that
too
on
examination
was
even
more
firmly
secured
than
the
one
which
opened
on
the
gallery
two
heavy
bolts
on
the
inside
effectually
prevented
any
de
on
the
lieutenant
from
that
quarter
he
was
more
puzzled
than
ever
nor
did
the
minutest
inspection
of
the
walls
and
floor
throw
any
light
upon
the
subject
one
thing
only
was
clear
the
breeches
were
gone
it
is
singular
said
the
lieutenant
tappington
generally
called
tapton
everard
is
an
antiquated
but
commodious
in
the
eastern
division
of
the
county
of
kent
a
former
proprietor
had
been
in
the
days
of
elizabeth
and
many
a
dark
and
dismal
tradition
was
yet
extant
of
the
licentiousness
of
his
life
and
the
enormity
of
his
offenses
the
glen
which
the
daughter
was
seen
to
enter
but
never
known
to
quit
still
frowns
darkly
as
of
yore
while
an
ineradicable
on
the
oaken
stair
yet
bids
defiance
to
the
united
energies
of
soap
and
sand
but
it
is
with
one
particular
apartment
that
a
deed
of
more
especial
atrocity
is
said
to
be
connected
a
stranger
guest
so
runs
the
legend
arrived
unexpectedly
at
the
mansion
of
the
bad
sir
giles
they
met
in
apparent
friendship
but
the
scowl
on
their
master
brow
told
the
domestics
that
the
visit
was
not
a
welcome
one
the
banquet
however
was
not
spared
the
circulated
freely
too
freely
perhaps
for
sounds
of
discord
at
length
reached
the
ears
of
even
the
excluded
as
they
were
doing
their
best
to
imitate
their
betters
in
the
lower
hall
alarmed
some
of
them
ventured
to
approach
the
parlor
one
an
old
and
favored
retainer
of
the
house
went
so
far
as
to
break
in
upon
his
master
privacy
sir
giles
already
high
in
oath
fiercely
enjoined
his
absence
and
he
retired
not
however
before
he
had
distinctly
heard
from
the
stranger
lips
a
menace
that
there
was
that
within
his
pocket
which
could
disprove
the
right
to
issue
that
or
any
other
command
within
the
walls
of
tapton
the
intrusion
though
momentary
seemed
to
have
produced
a
beneficial
effect
the
voices
of
the
disputants
fell
and
the
conversation
was
carried
on
thenceforth
in
a
more
subdued
tone
till
as
evening
closed
in
the
domestics
when
summoned
to
attend
with
lights
found
not
only
cordiality
restored
but
that
a
still
deeper
carouse
was
meditated
fresh
stoups
and
from
the
choicest
bins
were
produced
nor
was
it
till
at
a
late
or
rather
early
hour
that
the
revelers
sought
their
chambers
the
one
allotted
to
the
stranger
occupied
the
first
floor
of
the
eastern
angle
of
the
building
and
had
once
been
the
favorite
apartment
of
sir
giles
himself
scandal
ascribed
this
preference
to
the
facility
which
a
private
staircase
communicating
with
the
grounds
had
afforded
him
in
the
old
knight
time
of
following
his
wicked
courses
unchecked
by
parental
observation
a
consideration
which
ceased
to
be
of
weight
when
the
death
of
his
father
left
him
uncontrolled
master
of
his
estate
and
actions
from
that
period
sir
giles
had
established
himself
in
what
were
called
the
state
apartments
and
the
oaken
chamber
was
rarely
tenanted
save
on
occasions
of
extraordinary
festivity
or
when
the
yule
log
drew
an
unusually
large
accession
of
guests
around
the
christmas
hearth
on
this
eventful
night
it
was
prepared
for
the
unknown
visitor
who
sought
his
couch
heated
and
inflamed
from
his
midnight
orgies
and
in
the
morning
was
found
in
his
bed
a
swollen
and
blackened
corpse
no
marks
of
violence
appeared
upon
the
body
but
the
livid
hue
of
the
lips
and
certain
spots
visible
on
the
skin
aroused
suspicions
which
those
who
entertained
them
were
too
timid
to
express
apoplexy
induced
by
the
excesses
of
the
preceding
night
sir
giles
confidential
leech
pronounced
to
be
the
cause
of
his
sudden
dissolution
the
body
was
buried
in
peace
and
though
some
shook
their
heads
as
they
witnessed
the
haste
with
which
the
funeral
rites
were
hurried
on
none
ventured
to
murmur
other
events
arose
to
distract
the
attention
of
the
retainers
men
minds
became
occupied
by
the
stirring
politics
of
the
day
while
the
near
approach
of
that
formidable
armada
so
vainly
arrogating
itself
a
title
which
the
very
elements
joined
with
human
valor
to
disprove
soon
interfered
to
weaken
if
not
obliterate
all
remembrance
of
the
nameless
stranger
who
had
died
within
the
walls
of
tapton
everard
years
rolled
on
the
bad
sir
giles
had
himself
long
since
gone
to
his
account
the
last
as
it
was
believed
of
his
immediate
line
though
a
few
of
the
older
tenants
were
sometimes
heard
to
speak
of
an
elder
brother
who
had
disappeared
in
early
life
and
never
inherited
the
estate
rumors
too
of
his
having
left
a
son
in
foreign
lands
were
at
one
time
rife
but
they
died
away
nothing
occurring
to
support
them
the
property
passed
unchallenged
to
a
collateral
branch
of
the
family
and
the
secret
if
secret
there
were
was
buried
in
denton
churchyard
in
the
lonely
grave
of
the
mysterious
stranger
one
circumstance
alone
occurred
after
a
period
to
revive
the
memory
of
these
transactions
some
workmen
employed
in
grubbing
an
old
plantation
for
the
purpose
of
raising
on
its
site
a
modern
shrubbery
dug
up
in
the
execution
of
their
task
the
mildewed
remnants
of
what
seemed
to
have
been
once
a
garment
on
more
minute
inspection
enough
remained
of
silken
slashes
and
a
coarse
embroidery
to
identify
the
relics
as
having
once
formed
part
of
a
pair
of
trunk
hose
while
a
few
papers
which
fell
from
them
altogether
illegible
from
damp
and
age
were
by
the
unlearned
rustics
conveyed
to
the
then
owner
of
the
estate
whether
the
squire
was
more
successful
in
deciphering
them
was
never
known
he
certainly
never
alluded
to
their
contents
and
little
would
have
been
thought
of
the
matter
but
for
the
inconvenient
memory
of
one
old
woman
who
declared
she
heard
her
grandfather
say
that
when
the
strange
guest
was
poisoned
though
all
the
rest
of
his
clothes
were
there
his
breeches
the
supposed
repository
of
the
supposed
documents
could
never
be
found
the
master
of
tapton
everard
smiled
when
he
heard
dame
jones
hint
of
deeds
which
might
impeach
the
validity
of
his
own
title
in
favor
of
some
unknown
descendant
of
some
unknown
heir
and
the
story
was
rarely
alluded
to
save
by
one
or
two
who
had
heard
that
others
had
seen
the
ghost
of
old
sir
giles
in
his
issue
from
the
postern
enter
the
adjoining
copse
and
wring
his
shadowy
hands
in
agony
as
he
seemed
to
search
vainly
for
something
hidden
among
the
evergreens
the
stranger
had
of
course
been
occasionally
haunted
from
the
time
of
his
decease
but
the
periods
of
visitation
had
latterly
become
very
rare
even
botherby
the
housekeeper
being
forced
to
admit
that
during
her
long
sojourn
at
the
manor
she
had
never
met
with
anything
worse
than
herself
though
as
the
old
lady
afterwards
added
upon
more
mature
reflection
i
must
say
i
think
i
saw
the
devil
such
was
the
legend
attached
to
tapton
everard
and
such
the
story
which
the
lively
caroline
ingoldsby
detailed
to
her
equally
mercurial
cousin
charles
seaforth
lieutenant
in
the
hon
east
india
company
second
regiment
of
bombay
fencibles
as
they
promenaded
a
gallery
decked
with
some
dozen
ancestral
portraits
and
among
others
with
that
of
the
redoubted
sir
giles
himself
the
gallant
commander
had
that
very
morning
paid
his
first
visit
to
the
house
of
his
maternal
uncle
after
an
absence
of
several
years
passed
with
his
regiment
on
the
arid
plains
of
hindostan
whence
he
was
now
returned
on
a
three
years
furlough
he
had
gone
out
a
boy
he
returned
a
man
but
the
impression
made
upon
his
youthful
fancy
by
his
favorite
cousin
remained
unimpaired
and
to
tapton
he
directed
his
steps
even
before
he
sought
the
home
of
his
widowed
mother
comforting
himself
in
this
breach
of
filial
decorum
by
the
reflection
that
as
the
manor
was
so
little
out
of
his
way
it
would
be
unkind
to
pass
as
it
were
the
door
of
his
relatives
without
just
looking
in
for
a
few
hours
but
he
found
his
uncle
as
hospitable
and
his
cousin
more
charming
than
ever
and
the
looks
of
one
and
the
requests
of
the
other
soon
precluded
the
possibility
of
refusing
to
lengthen
the
few
hours
into
a
few
days
though
the
house
was
at
the
moment
full
of
visitors
the
peterses
were
from
ramsgate
and
and
the
two
miss
simpkinsons
from
bath
had
come
to
pass
a
month
with
the
family
and
tom
ingoldsby
had
brought
down
his
college
friend
the
honorable
augustus
sucklethumbkin
with
his
groom
and
pointers
to
take
a
shooting
and
then
there
was
ogleton
the
rich
young
widow
with
her
large
black
eyes
who
people
did
say
was
setting
her
cap
at
the
young
squire
though
botherby
did
not
believe
it
and
above
all
there
was
mademoiselle
pauline
her
de
who
everything
and
everybody
and
cried
horreur
at
botherby
cap
in
short
to
use
the
and
lady
own
expression
the
house
was
to
the
very
attics
all
save
the
oaken
chamber
which
as
the
lieutenant
expressed
a
most
magnanimous
disregard
of
ghosts
was
forthwith
appropriated
to
his
particular
accommodation
maguire
meanwhile
was
fain
to
share
the
apartment
of
oliver
dobbs
the
squire
own
man
a
jocular
proposal
of
joint
occupancy
having
been
first
indignantly
rejected
by
mademoiselle
though
preferred
with
the
laste
taste
in
life
of
barney
most
insinuating
brogue
come
charles
the
urn
is
absolutely
getting
cold
your
breakfast
will
be
quite
spoiled
what
can
have
made
you
so
idle
such
was
the
morning
salutation
of
miss
ingoldsby
to
the
as
he
entered
the
half
an
hour
after
the
latest
of
the
party
a
pretty
gentleman
truly
to
make
an
appointment
with
chimed
in
miss
frances
what
is
become
of
our
ramble
to
the
rocks
before
breakfast
oh
the
young
men
never
think
of
keeping
a
promise
now
said
peters
a
little
woman
with
underdone
eyes
when
i
was
a
young
man
said
peters
i
remember
i
always
made
a
point
of
pray
how
long
ago
was
that
asked
simpkinson
from
bath
why
sir
when
i
married
peters
i
was
let
me
see
i
was
do
pray
hold
your
tongue
and
eat
your
breakfast
interrupted
his
better
half
who
had
a
mortal
horror
of
chronological
references
very
rude
to
tease
people
with
your
family
affairs
the
lieutenant
had
by
this
time
taken
his
seat
in
silence
a
nod
and
a
glance
being
the
extent
of
his
salutation
smitten
as
he
was
and
in
the
immediate
presence
of
her
who
had
made
so
large
a
hole
in
his
heart
his
manner
was
evidently
which
the
fair
caroline
in
her
secret
soul
attributed
to
his
being
solely
occupied
by
her
how
would
she
have
bridled
had
she
known
that
they
only
shared
his
meditations
with
a
pair
of
breeches
charles
drank
his
coffee
and
spiked
some
eggs
darting
occasionally
a
penetrating
glance
at
the
ladies
in
hope
of
detecting
the
supposed
waggery
by
the
evidence
of
some
furtive
smile
or
conscious
look
but
in
vain
not
a
dimple
moved
indicative
of
roguery
nor
did
the
slightest
elevation
of
eyebrow
rise
confirmative
of
his
suspicions
hints
and
insinuations
passed
unheeded
more
particular
inquiries
were
out
of
the
question
the
subject
was
unapproachable
in
the
meantime
patent
cords
were
just
the
thing
for
a
ride
and
breakfast
ended
away
cantered
the
party
over
the
downs
till
every
faculty
absorbed
by
the
beauties
animate
and
inanimate
which
surrounded
him
lieutenant
seaforth
of
the
bombay
fencibles
bestowed
no
more
thought
upon
his
breeches
than
if
he
had
been
born
on
the
top
of
ben
lomond
another
night
had
passed
away
the
sun
rose
brilliantly
forming
with
his
level
beams
a
splendid
rainbow
in
the
west
whither
the
heavy
cloud
which
for
the
last
two
hours
had
been
pouring
its
waters
on
the
earth
was
now
flying
before
him
ah
then
and
it
little
good
it
be
the
claning
of
ye
apostrophized
barney
maguire
as
he
deposited
in
front
of
his
master
toilet
a
pair
of
bran
new
jockey
boots
one
of
primest
fits
which
the
lieutenant
had
purchased
in
his
way
through
town
on
that
very
morning
had
they
come
for
the
first
time
under
the
valet
depurating
hand
so
little
soiled
indeed
from
the
turfy
ride
of
the
preceding
day
that
a
less
scrupulous
domestic
might
perhaps
have
considered
the
application
of
warren
matchless
or
oxalic
acid
altogether
superfluous
not
so
barney
with
the
nicest
care
had
he
removed
the
slightest
impurity
from
each
polished
surface
and
there
they
stood
rejoicing
in
their
sable
radiance
no
wonder
a
pang
shot
across
maguire
breast
as
he
thought
on
the
work
now
cut
out
for
them
so
different
from
the
light
labors
of
the
day
before
no
wonder
he
murmured
with
a
sigh
as
the
scarce
dried
disclosed
a
road
now
inch
deep
in
mud
ah
then
it
little
good
claning
of
ye
for
well
had
he
learned
in
the
hall
below
that
eight
miles
of
a
stiff
clay
soil
lay
between
the
manor
and
bolsover
abbey
whose
picturesque
ruins
like
ancient
rome
majestic
in
decay
the
party
had
determined
to
explore
the
master
had
already
commenced
dressing
and
the
man
was
fitting
straps
upon
a
light
pair
of
spurs
when
his
hand
was
arrested
by
the
old
question
barney
where
are
the
breeches
they
were
nowhere
to
be
found
seaforth
descended
that
morning
whip
in
hand
and
equipped
in
a
handsome
green
but
no
breeches
and
boots
to
match
were
there
loose
jean
trousers
surmounting
a
pair
of
diminutive
wellingtons
embraced
somewhat
incongruously

fine

which
that
exemplary
matron
was
in
the
constant
habit

administering
to
her
as
she
called
him
whenever
he
prepared
to
vent
his
reminiscences
her
precise
reason
for
this
it
would
be
difficult
to
determine
unless
indeed
the
story
be
true
which
a
little
bird
had
whispered
into
ear
peters
though
now
a
wealthy
man
had
received
a
liberal
education
at
a
charity
school
and
was
apt
to
recur
to
the
days
of
his
and
leathers
as
usual
he
took
his

hint
in
good
part
and
paused
in
his
reply

only
because
he
had
not
thrown
it
off
himself
she
had
caught
hold
of
its
tail
however
while
it
yet
hung
upon
his
honored
shoulders
to
souls
so
congenial
what
a
sight
was
the
magnificent
ruin
of
bolsover
its
broken
arches
its
mouldering
pinnacles
and
the
airy
tracery
of
its
windows
the
party
were
in
raptures
simpkinson
began
to
meditate
an
essay
and
his
daughter
an
ode
even
seaforth
as
he
gazed
on
these
lonely
relics
of
the
olden
time
was
betrayed
into
a
momentary
forgetfulness
of
his
love
and
losses
the
widow
turned
from
her
whiskers
to
the
mantling
ivy
peters
wiped
her
spectacles
and
her
supposed
the
central
tower
had
once
been
the
county
jail
the
squire
was
a
philosopher
and
had
been
there
often
before
so
he
ordered
out
the
cold
tongue
and
chickens
bolsover
priory
said
simpkinson
with
the
air
of
a
connoisseur
bolsover
priory
was
founded
in
the
reign
of
henry
the
sixth
about
the
beginning
of
the
eleventh
century
hugh
de
bolsover
had
accompanied
that
monarch
to
the
holy
land
in
the
expedition
undertaken
by
way
of
penance
for
the
murder
of
his
young
nephews
in
the
tower
upon
the
dissolution
of
the
monasteries
the
veteran
was
enfeoffed
in
the
lands
and
manor
to
which
he
gave
his
own
name
of
bowlsover
or
by
corruption
bolsover
a
bee
in
chief
over
three
owls
all
proper
being
the
armorial
ensigns
borne
by
this
distinguished
crusader
at
the
siege
of
acre
ah
that
was
sir
sidney
smith
said
peters
i
heard
tell
of
him
and
all
about
partington
and
be
quiet
and
do
expose
yourself
sharply
interrupted
his
lady
was
silenced
and
betook
himself
to
the
bottled
stout
these
lands
continued
the
antiquary
were
held
in
grand
serjeantry
by
the
presentation
of
three
white
owls
and
pot
of
honey
lassy
me
how
nice
said
miss
julia
peters
licked
his
lips
pray
give
me
leave
my
dear
owls
and
honey
whenever
the
king
should
come
a
into
this
part
of
the
country
ejaculated
the
squire
pausing
abruptly
in
the
mastication
of
a
drumstick
to
be
sure
my
dear
sir
do
you
remember
the
rats
came
under
the
forest
laws
a
minor
species
of
venison
and
mice
and
such
small
deer
eh
shakespeare
you
know
our
ancestors
ate
rats
nasty
fellows
shuddered
miss
julia
in
a
parenthesis
and
owls
you
know
are
capital
mousers
i
seen
a
howl
said
peters
there
one
in
the
sohological
gardens
a
little
chap
in
a
wig
only
its
feathers
and
poor
was
destined
never
to
finish
a
speech
be
quiet
cried
the
authoritative
voice
and
the
naturalist
shrank
into
his
shell
like
a
snail
in
the
sohological
gardens
you
should
read
blount
ingoldsby
pursued
simpkinson
a
learned
man
was
blount
why
sir
his
royal
highness
the
duke
of
york
once
paid
a
silver
to
lord
ferrers
i
heard
of
him
broke
in
the
incorrigible
peters
he
was
hanged
at
the
old
bailey
in
a
silk
rope
for
shooting
dr
johnson
the
antiquary
vouchsafed
no
notice
of
the
interruption
but
taking
a
pinch
of
snuff
continued
his
harangue
a
silver
sir
which
is
due
from
every
scion
of
royalty
who
rides
across
one
of
his
manors
and
if
you
look
into
the
penny
county
histories
now
publishing
by
an
eminent
friend
of
mine
you
will
find
that
langhale
in
norf
was
held
by
one
baldwin
saltum
sufflatum
et
that
is
he
was
to
come
every
christmas
into
westminster
hall
there
to
take
a
leap
cry
hem
and
simpkinson
a
glass
of
sherry
cried
tom
ingoldsby
hastily
not
any
thank
you
sir
this
baldwin
surnamed
ogleton
challenges
you
sir
she
insists
upon
it
said
tom
still
more
rapidly
at
the
same
time
filling
a
glass
and
forcing
it
on
the
who
thus
arrested
in
the
very
crisis
of
his
narrative
received
and
swallowed
the
potation
as
if
it
had
been
physic
what
on
earth
has
miss
simpkinson
discovered
there
continued
tom
something
of
interest
see
how
fast
she
is
writing
the
diversion
was
effectual
every
one
looked
towards
miss
simpkinson
who
far
too
ethereal
for
creature
comforts
was
seated
apart
on
the
dilapidated
remains
of
an
committing
eagerly
to
paper
something
that
had
strongly
impressed
her
the
air
the
eye
in
a
fine
frenzy
rolling
all
betokened
that
the
divine
was
come
her
father
rose
and
stole
silently
towards
her
what
an
old
boar
muttered
young
ingoldsby
alluding
perhaps
to
a
slice
of
brawn
which
he
had
just
begun
to
operate
upon
but
which
from
the
celerity
with
which
it
disappeared
did
not
seem
so
very
difficult
of
mastication
but
what
had
become
of
seaforth
and
his
fair
caroline
all
this
while
why
it
so
happened
that
they
had
been
simultaneously
stricken
with
the
picturesque
appearance
of
one
of
those
high
and
pointed
arches
which
that
eminent
antiquary
horseley
curties
has
described
in
his
as
a
window
of
the
order
and
then
the
ivy
clustered
so
thickly
and
so
beautifully
on
the
other
side
that
they
went
round
to
look
at
that
and
then
their
proximity
deprived
it
of
half
its
effect
and
so
they
walked
across
to
a
little
knoll
a
hundred
yards
off
and
in
crossing
a
small
ravine
they
came
to
what
in
ireland
they
call
a
bad
step
and
charles
had
to
carry
his
cousin
over
it
and
then
when
they
had
to
come
back
she
would
not
give
him
the
trouble
again
for
the
world
so
they
followed
a
better
but
more
circuitous
route
and
there
were
hedges
and
ditches
in
the
way
and
stiles
to
get
over
and
gates
to
get
through
so
that
an
hour
or
more
had
elapsed
before
they
were
able
to
rejoin
the
party
lassy
me
said
miss
julia
simpkinson
how
long
you
have
been
gone
and
so
they
had
the
remark
was
a
very
just
as
well
as
a
very
natural
one
they
were
gone
a
long
while
and
a
nice
cosy
chat
they
had
and
what
do
you
think
it
was
all
about
my
dear
miss
o
lassy
me
love
no
doubt
and
the
moon
and
eyes
and
nightingales
and
stay
stay
my
sweet
young
lady
do
not
let
the
fervor
of
your
feelings
run
away
with
you
i
do
not
pretend
to
say
indeed
that
one
or
more
of
these
pretty
subjects
might
not
have
been
introduced
but
the
most
important
and
leading
topic
of
the
conference
was
lieutenant
breeches
caroline
said
charles
i
have
had
some
very
odd
dreams
since
i
have
been
at
tappington
dreams
have
you
smiled
the
young
lady
arching
her
taper
neck
like
a
swan
in
pluming
dreams
have
you
ah
dreams
or
dream
perhaps
i
should
say
for
though
repeated
it
was
still
the
same
and
what
do
you
imagine
was
its
subject
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
divine
said
the
tongue
i
have
not
the
least
difficulty
in
guessing
said
the
eye
as
plainly
as
ever
eye
spoke
i
dreamt
of
your
there
was
a
change
in
the
glance
my
yes
the
old
sir
giles
or
sir
john
you
told
me
about
the
other
day
he
walked
into
my
bedroom
in
his
short
cloak
of
velvet
his
long
rapier
and
his
hat
and
feather
just
as
the
picture
represents
him
but
with
one
exception
and
what
was
that
why
his
lower
extremities
which
were
visible
were
those
of
a
skeleton
well
well
after
taking
a
turn
or
two
about
the
room
and
looking
round
him
with
a
wistful
air
he
came
to
the
bed
foot
stared
at
me
in
a
manner
impossible
to
describe
and
then
he
he
laid
hold
of
my
pantaloons
whipped
his
long
bony
legs
into
them
in
a
twinkling
and
strutting
up
to
the
glass
seemed
to
view
himself
in
it
with
great
complacency
i
tried
to
speak
but
in
vain
the
effort
however
seemed
to
excite
his
attention
for
wheeling
about
he
showed
me
the
death
head
you
can
well
imagine
and
with
an
indescribable
grin
strutted
out
of
the
room
absurd
charles
how
can
you
talk
such
nonsense
but
caroline
the
breeches
are
really
gone
on
the
following
morning
contrary
to
his
usual
custom
seaforth
was
the
first
person
in
the
breakfast
parlor
as
no
one
else
was
present
he
did
precisely
what
nine
young
men
out
of
ten
so
situated
would
have
done
he
walked
up
to
the
mantelpiece
established
himself
upon
the
rug
and
subducting
his
one
under
each
arm
turned
towards
the
fire
that
portion
of
the
human
frame
which
it
is
considered
equally
indecorous
to
present
to
a
friend
or
an
enemy
a
serious
not
to
say
anxious
expression
was
visible
upon
his
countenance
and
his
mouth
was
fast
buttoning
itself
up
for
an
incipient
whistle
when
little
flo
a
tiny
spaniel
of
the
blenheim
breed
the
pet
object
of
miss
julia
simpkinson
affections
bounced
out
from
beneath
a
sofa
and
began
to
bark
at
his
pantaloons
they
were
cleverly
built
of
a
mixture
a
broad
stripe
of
the
most
vivid
scarlet
traversing
each
seam
in
a
perpendicular
direction
from
hip
to
ankle
in
short
the
regimental
costume
of
the
royal
bombay
fencibles
the
animal
educated
in
the
country
had
never
seen
such
a
pair
of
breeches
in
her
life
ignotum
pro
magnifico
the
scarlet
streak
inflamed
as
it
was
by
the
reflection
of
the
fire
seemed
to
act
on
flora
nerves
as
the
same
color
does
on
those
of
bulls
and
turkeys
she
advanced
at
the
de
and
her
vociferation
like
her
amazement
was
unbounded
a
sound
kick
from
the
disgusted
officer
changed
its
character
and
induced
a
retreat
at
the
very
moment
when
the
mistress
of
the
pugnacious
quadruped
entered
to
the
rescue
lassy
me
flo
what
the
matter
cried
the
sympathizing
lady
with
a
scrutinizing
glance
leveled
at
the
gentleman
it
might
as
well
have
lighted
on
a
feather
bed
his
air
of
imperturbable
unconsciousness
defied
examination
and
as
he
would
not
and
flora
could
not
expound
that
injured
individual
was
compelled
to
pocket
up
her
wrongs
others
of
the
household
soon
dropped
in
and
clustered
round
the
board
dedicated
to
the
most
sociable
of
meals
the
urn
was
paraded
hissing
hot
and
the
cups
which
cheer
but
not
inebriate
steamed
redolent
of
hyson
and
pekoe
muffins
and
marmalade
newspapers
and
finnan
haddies
left
little
room
for
observation
on
the
character
of
charles
warlike
at
length
a
look
from
caroline
followed
by
a
smile
that
nearly
ripened
to
a
titter
caused
him
to
turn
abruptly
and
address
his
neighbor
it
was
miss
simpkinson
who
deeply
engaged
in
sipping
her
tea
and
turning
over
her
album
seemed
like
a
female
chrononotonthologos
immersed
in
cogibundity
of
cogitation
an
interrogatory
on
the
subject
of
her
studies
drew
from
her
the
confession
that
she
was
at
that
moment
employed
in
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
a
poem
inspired
by
the
romantic
shades
of
bolsover
the
entreaties
of
the
company
were
of
course
urgent
peters
who
liked
verses
was
especially
persevering
and
sappho
at
length
compliant
after
a
preparatory
hem
and
a
glance
at
the
mirror
to
ascertain
that
her
look
was
sufficiently
sentimental
the
poetess
began
there
is
a
calm
a
holy
feeling
vulgar
minds
can
never
know
the
bosom
softly
stealing
chasten
grief
delicious
woe
oh
how
sweet
at
eve
regaining
yon
lone
tower
sequester
shade
sadly
mute
and
uncomplaining
yow
yeough
yeough
yow
yow
yelled
a
hapless
sufferer
from
beneath
the
table
it
was
an
unlucky
hour
for
quadrupeds
and
if
every
dog
will
have
his
day
he
could
not
have
selected
a
more
unpropitious
one
than
this
ogleton
too
had
a
pet
a
favorite
pug
whose
squab
figure
black
muzzle
and
tortuosity
of
tail
that
curled
like
a
head
of
celery
in
a
bespoke
his
dutch
extraction
yow
yow
yow
continued
the
brute
a
chorus
in
which
flo
instantly
joined
sooth
to
say
pug
had
more
reason
to
express
his
dissatisfaction
than
was
given
him
by
the
muse
of
simpkinson
the
other
only
barked
for
company
scarcely
had
the
poetess
got
through
her
first
stanza
when
tom
ingoldsby
in
the
enthusiasm
of
the
moment
became
so
lost
in
the
material
world
that
in
his
abstraction
he
unwarily
laid
his
hand
on
the
cock
of
the
urn
quivering
with
emotion
he
gave
it
such
an
unlucky
twist
that
the
full
stream
of
its
scalding
contents
descended
on
the
gingerbread
hide
of
the
unlucky
cupid
the
confusion
was
complete
the
whole
economy
of
the
table
disarranged
the
company
broke
up
in
most
admired
disorder
and
vulgar
minds
will
never
know
anything
more
of
miss
simpkinson
ode
till
they
peruse
it
in
some
forthcoming
annual
seaforth
profited
by
the
confusion
to
take
the
delinquent
who
had
caused
this
stramash
by
the
arm
and
to
lead
him
to
the
lawn
where
he
had
a
word
or
two
for
his
private
ear
the
conference
between
the
young
gentlemen
was
neither
brief
in
its
duration
nor
unimportant
in
its
result
the
subject
was
what
the
lawyers
call
tripartite
embracing
the
information
that
charles
seaforth
was
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
tom
ingoldsby
sister
secondly
that
the
lady
had
referred
him
to
papa
for
his
sanction
thirdly
and
lastly
his
nightly
visitations
and
consequent
bereavement
at
the
two
first
times
tom
smiled
suspiciously
at
the
last
he
burst
out
into
an
absolute
guffaw
steal
your
breeches
miss
bailey
over
again
by
jove
shouted
ingoldsby
but
a
gentleman
you
say
and
sir
giles
too
i
am
not
sure
charles
whether
i
ought
not
to
call
you
out
for
aspersing
the
honor
of
the
family
laugh
as
you
will
tom
be
as
incredulous
as
you
please
one
fact
is
incontestable
the
breeches
are
gone
look
here
i
am
reduced
to
my
regimentals
and
if
these
go
i
must
borrow
of
you
rochefoucault
says
there
is
something
in
the
misfortunes
of
our
very
best
friends
that
does
not
displease
us
assuredly
we
can
most
of
us
laugh
at
their
petty
inconveniences
till
called
upon
to
supply
them
tom
composed
his
features
on
the
instant
and
replied
with
more
gravity
as
well
as
with
an
expletive
which
if
my
lord
mayor
had
been
within
hearing
might
have
cost
him
five
shillings
there
is
something
very
queer
in
this
after
all
the
clothes
you
say
have
positively
disappeared
somebody
is
playing
you
a
trick
and
ten
to
one
your
servant
had
a
hand
in
it
by
the
way
i
heard
something
yesterday
of
his
kicking
up
a
bobbery
in
the
kitchen
and
seeing
a
ghost
or
something
of
that
kind
himself
depend
upon
it
barney
is
in
the
plot
it
now
struck
the
lieutenant
at
once
that
the
usually
buoyant
spirits
of
his
attendant
had
of
late
been
materially
sobered
down
his
loquacity
obviously
circumscribed
and
that
he
the
said
lieutenant
had
actually
rung
his
bell
three
several
times
that
very
morning
before
he
could
procure
his
attendance
maguire
was
forthwith
summoned
and
underwent
a
close
examination
the
bobbery
was
easily
explained
oliver
dobbs
had
hinted
his
disapprobation
of
a
flirtation
carrying
on
between
the
gentleman
from
munster
and
the
lady
from
the
rue
honoré
mademoiselle
had
boxed
maguire
ears
and
maguire
had
pulled
mademoiselle
upon
his
knee
and
the
lady
had
cried
and
oliver
dobbs
said
it
was
very
wrong
and
botherby
said
it
was
scandalous
and
what
ought
not
to
be
done
in
any
moral
kitchen
and
maguire
had
got
hold
of
the
honorable
augustus
and
had
put
large
pinches
of
the
best
double
dartford
into
dobbs
and
dobbs
pipe
had
exploded
and
set
fire
to
botherby
sunday
cap
and
maguire
had
put
it
out
with
the
barring
the
wig
and
then
they
were
all
so
cantankerous
that
barney
had
gone
to
take
a
walk
in
the
garden
and
then
then
barney
had
seen
a
ghost
a
what
you
blockhead
asked
tom
ingoldsby
sure
then
and
it
meself
will
tell
your
honor
the
rights
of
it
said
the
meself
and
miss
pauline
sir
or
miss
pauline
and
meself
for
the
ladies
comes
first
anyhow
we
got
tired
of
the
hobstroppylous
scrimmaging
among
the
ould
servants
that
did
know
a
joke
when
they
seen
one
and
we
went
out
to
look
at
the
comet
the
they
calls
him
in
this
country
and
we
walked
upon
the
lawn
and
divil
of
any
alehouse
there
was
there
at
all
and
miss
pauline
said
it
was
bekase
of
the
shrubbery
maybe
and
why
we
see
it
better
beyonst
the
tree
and
so
we
went
to
the
trees
but
sorrow
a
comet
did
meself
see
there
barring
a
big
ghost
instead
of
it
a
ghost
and
what
sort
of
a
ghost
barney
och
then
divil
a
lie
i
tell
your
honor
a
tall
ould
gentleman
he
was
all
in
white
with
a
shovel
on
the
shoulder
of
him
and
a
big
torch
in
his
fist
though
what
he
wanted
with
that
it
meself
ca
tell
for
his
eyes
were
like
let
alone
the
moon
and
the
comet
which
was
there
at
all
and
says
he
to
me
why
he
knew
me
says
he
is
it
you
doing
with
the
there
barney
divil
a
word
did
i
say
miss
pauline
screeched
and
cried
murther
in
french
and
ran
off
with
herself
and
of
course
meself
was
in
a
mighty
hurry
after
the
lady
and
had
no
time
to
stop
palavering
with
him
any
way
so
i
dispersed
at
once
and
the
ghost
vanished
in
a
flame
of
fire
maguire
account
was
received
with
avowed
incredulity
by
both
gentlemen
but
barney
stuck
to
his
text
with
unflinching
pertinacity
a
reference
to
mademoiselle
was
suggested
but
abandoned
as
neither
party
had
a
taste
for
delicate
investigations
i
tell
you
what
seaforth
said
ingoldsby
after
barney
had
received
his
dismissal
that
there
is
a
trick
here
is
evident
and
barney
vision
may
possibly
be
a
part
of
it
whether
he
is
most
knave
or
fool
you
best
know
at
all
events
i
will
sit
up
with
you
and
see
if
i
can
convert
my
ancestor
into
a
visiting
acquaintance
meanwhile
your
finger
on
your
lip
was
now
the
very
witching
time
of
night
when
churchyards
yawn
and
graves
give
up
their
dead
gladly
would
i
grace
my
tale
with
decent
horror
and
therefore
i
do
beseech
the
gentle
reader
to
believe
that
if
all
the
to
this
mysterious
narrative
are
not
in
strict
keeping
he
will
ascribe
it
only
to
the
disgraceful
innovations
of
modern
degeneracy
upon
the
sober
and
dignified
habits
of
our
ancestors
i
can
introduce
him
it
is
true
into
an
old
and
chamber
its
walls
covered
in
three
sides
with
black
oak
wainscoting
adorned
with
carvings
of
fruit
and
flowers
long
anterior
to
those
of
grinling
gibbons
the
fourth
side
is
clothed
with
a
curious
remnant
of
dingy
tapestry
once
elucidatory
of
some
scriptural
history
but
of
not
even
botherby
could
determine
simpkinson
who
had
examined
it
carefully
inclined
to
believe
the
principal
figure
to
be
either
bathsheba
or
daniel
in
the
lions
den
while
tom
ingoldsby
decided
in
favor
of
the
king
of
bashan
all
however
was
conjecture
tradition
being
silent
on
the
subject
a
lofty
arched
portal
led
into
and
a
little
arched
portal
led
out
of
this
apartment
they
were
opposite
each
other
and
each
possessed
the
security
of
massy
bolts
on
its
interior
the
bedstead
too
was
not
one
of
yesterday
but
manifestly
coeval
with
days
ere
seddons
was
and
when
a
good
article
was
deemed
worthy
of
being
a
royal
bequest
the
bed
itself
with
all
the
appurtenances
of
palliasse
mattresses
was
of
far
later
date
and
looked
most
incongruously
comfortable
the
casements
too
with
their
little
panes
and
iron
binding
had
given
way
to
the
modern
heterodoxy
of
the
nor
was
this
all
that
conspired
to
ruin
the
costume
and
render
the
room
a
meet
haunt
for
such
mixed
spirits
only
as
could
condescend
to
don
at
the
same
time
an
elizabethan
doublet
and
bond
street
inexpressibles
with
their
green
morocco
slippers
on
a
modern
fender
in
front
of
a
disgracefully
modern
grate
sat
two
young
gentlemen
clad
in
shawl
pattern
and
black
silk
stocks
much
at
variance
with
the
high
chairs
which
supported
them
a
bunch
of
abomination
called
a
cigar
reeked
in
the
corner
of
the
mouth
of
one
and
in
the
corner
of
the
mouth
of
the
other
an
arrangement
happily
adapted
for
the
escape
of
the
noxious
fumes
up
the
chimney
without
that
unmerciful
funking
each
other
which
a
less
scientific
disposition
of
the
weed
would
have
induced
a
small
pembroke
table
filled
up
the
intervening
space
between
them
sustaining
at
each
extremity
an
elbow
and
a
glass
of
toddy
thus
in
lonely
pensive
contemplation
were
the
two
worthies
occupied
when
the
iron
tongue
of
midnight
had
tolled
twelve
come
said
ingoldsby
taking
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
a
watch
like
a
gold
and
consulting
it
as
though
he
suspected
the
over
the
stables
of
mendacity
hush
said
charles
did
i
not
hear
a
footstep
there
was
a
pause
there
a
footstep
it
sounded
distinctly
it
reached
the
door
it
hesitated
stopped
and
passed
on
tom
darted
across
the
room
threw
open
the
door
and
became
aware
of
botherby
toddling
to
her
chamber
at
the
other
end
of
the
gallery
after
dosing
one
of
the
housemaids
with
an
approved
julep
from
the
countess
of
kent

to

said
the
disappointed
an
hour
two
rolled
on
and
still
no
spectral
visitation
nor
did
aught
intervene
to
make
night
hideous
and
when
the
sounded
at
length
the
hour
of
three
ingoldsby
whose
patience
and
grog
were
alike
exhausted
sprang
from
his
chair
saying
this
is
all
infernal
nonsense
my
good
fellow
deuce
of
any
ghost
shall
we
see
it
long
past
the
canonical
hour
i
off
to
bed
and
as
to
your
breeches
i
insure
them
for
the
next
hours
at
least
at
the
price
of
the
buckram
oh
to
be
sure
stammered
charles
rousing
himself
from
a
reverie
which
had
degenerated
into
an
absolute
snooze
my
boy
bolt
the
door
behind
me
and
defy
the
pope
the
devil
and
the
pretender
seaforth
followed
his
friend
advice
and
the
next
morning
came
down
to
breakfast
dressed
in
the
habiliments
of
the
preceding
day
the
charm
was
broken
the
demon
defeated
the
light
greys
with
the
red
stripe
down
the
seams
were
yet
rerum
and
adorned
the
person
of
their
lawful
proprietor
tom
felicitated
himself
and
his
partner
of
the
watch
on
the
result
of
their
vigilance
but
there
is
a
rustic
adage
which
warns
us
against
before
we
are
quite
out
of
the
wood
seaforth
was
yet
within
its
verge
a
rap
at
tom
ingoldsby
door
the
following
morning
startled
him
as
he
was
shaving
he
cut
his
chin
come
in
and
be
d
d
to
you
said
the
martyr
pressing
his
thumb
on
the
scarified
epidermis
the
door
opened
and
exhibited
barney
maguire
well
barney
what
is
it
quoth
the
sufferer
adopting
the
vernacular
of
his
visitant
the
master
sir
well
what
does
he
want
the
loanst
of
a
breeches
plase
your
honor
why
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
by
heaven
this
is
too
good
shouted
tom
bursting
into
a
fit
of
uncontrollable
laughter
why
barney
you
do
mean
to
say
the
ghost
has
got
them
again
maguire
did
not
respond
to
the
young
squire
risibility
the
cast
of
his
countenance
was
decidedly
serious
faith
then
it
gone
they
are
sure
enough
has
meself
been
looking
over
the
bed
and
under
the
bed
and
the
bed
for
the
matter
of
that
and
divil
a
of
breeches
is
there
to
the
fore
at
all
i
bothered
entirely
barney
said
tom
incautiously
removing
his
thumb
and
letting
a
crimson
stream
incarnadine
the
multitudinous
lather
that
plastered
his
throat
this
may
be
all
very
well
with
your
master
but
you
do
humbug
sir
tell
me
instantly
what
have
you
done
with
the
clothes
this
abrupt
transition
from
lively
to
severe
certainly
took
maguire
by
surprise
and
he
seemed
for
an
instant
as
much
disconcerted
as
it
is
possible
to
disconcert
an
irish
gentleman
gentleman
me
is
it
meself
then
that
the
ghost
to
your
honor
thinking
said
he
after
a
moment
pause
and
with
a
slight
shade
of
indignation
in
his
tones
is
it
i
would
stale
the
master
things
and
what
would
i
do
with
them
that
you
best
know
what
your
purpose
is
i
ca
guess
for
i
think
you
mean
to
them
as
you
call
it
but
that
you
are
concerned
in
their
disappearance
i
am
satisfied
confound
this
blood
give
me
a
towel
barney
maguire
acquitted
himself
of
the
commission
as
i
a
sowl
your
honor
said
he
solemnly
little
it
is
meself
knows
of
the
matter
and
after
what
i
seen
what
you
seen
why
what
you
seen
barney
i
do
want
to
inquire
into
your
flirtations
but
do
suppose
you
can
palm
off
your
saucer
eyes
and
upon
me
then
as
sure
as
your
honor
standing
there
i
saw
him
and
why
would
i
when
miss
was
to
the
fore
as
well
as
meself
and
get
along
with
your
nonsense
leave
the
room
sir
but
the
master
said
barney
imploringly
and
without
a
breeches
sure
he
be
catching
cowld
take
that
rascal
replied
ingoldsby
throwing
a
pair
of
pantaloons
at
rather
than
to
him
but
do
suppose
sir
you
shall
carry
on
your
tricks
here
with
impunity
recollect
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
treadmill
and
that
my
father
is
a
county
magistrate
barney
eye
flashed
fire
he
stood
erect
and
was
about
to
speak
but
mastering
himself
not
without
an
effort
he
took
up
the
garment
and
left
the
room
as
perpendicular
as
a
quaker
ingoldsby
said
charles
seaforth
after
breakfast
this
is
now
past
a
joke
is
the
last
of
my
stay
for
notwithstanding
the
ties
which
detain
me
common
decency
obliges
me
to
visit
home
after
so
long
an
absence
i
shall
come
to
an
immediate
explanation
with
your
father
on
the
subject
nearest
my
heart
and
depart
while
i
have
a
change
of
dress
left
on
his
answer
will
my
return
depend
in
the
meantime
tell
me
candidly
i
ask
it
in
all
seriousness
and
as
a
friend
am
i
not
a
dupe
to
your
propensity
to
hoaxing
have
you
not
a
hand
in
no
by
heaven
seaforth
i
see
what
you
mean
on
my
honor
i
am
as
much
mystified
as
yourself
and
if
your
servant
not
he
if
there
be
a
trick
he
at
least
is
not
privy
to
it
if
there
a
trick
why
charles
do
you
think
i
know
not
to
think
tom
as
surely
as
you
are
a
living
man
so
surely
did
that
spectral
anatomy
visit
my
room
again
last
night
grin
in
my
face
and
walk
away
with
my
trousers
nor
was
i
able
to
spring
from
my
bed
or
break
the
chain
which
seemed
to
bind
me
to
my
pillow
seaforth
said
ingoldsby
after
a
short
pause
i
will
but
hush
here
are
the
girls
and
my
father
i
will
carry
off
the
females
and
leave
you
a
clear
field
with
the
governor
carry
your
point
with
him
and
we
will
talk
about
your
breeches
afterwards
tom
diversion
was
successful
he
carried
off
the
ladies
to
look
at
a
remarkable
specimen
of
the
class
which
they
could
not
find
while
seaforth
marched
boldly
up
to
the
encounter
and
carried
the
governor
outworks
by
a
de
i
shall
not
stop
to
describe
the
progress
of
the
attack
suffice
it
that
it
was
as
successful
as
could
have
been
wished
and
that
seaforth
was
referred
back
again
to
the
lady
the
happy
lover
was
off
at
a
tangent
the
botanical
party
was
soon
overtaken
and
the
arm
of
caroline
whom
a
vain
endeavor
to
spell
out
the
linnæan
name
of
a
had
detained
a
little
in
the
rear
of
the
others
was
soon
firmly
locked
in
his
own
what
was
the
world
to
them
its
noise
its
nonsense
and
its
breeches
all
seaforth
was
in
the
seventh
heaven
he
retired
to
his
room
that
night
as
happy
as
if
no
such
thing
as
a
goblin
had
ever
been
heard
of
and
personal
chattels
were
as
well
fenced
in
by
law
as
real
property
not
so
tom
ingoldsby
the
mystery
for
mystery
there
evidently
was
had
not
only
piqued
his
curiosity
but
ruffled
his
temper
the
watch
of
the
previous
night
had
been
unsuccessful
probably
because
it
was
undisguised
he
would
ensconce
himself
not
indeed
behind
the
arras
for
the
little
that
remained
was
as
we
have
seen
nailed
to
the
wall
but
in
a
small
closet
which
opened
from
one
corner
of
the
room
and
by
leaving
the
door
ajar
would
give
to
its
occupant
a
view
of
all
that
might
pass
in
the
apartment
here
did
the
young
take
up
a
position
with
a
good
stout
sapling
under
his
arm
a
full
before
seaforth
retired
for
the
night
not
even
his
friend
did
he
let
into
his
confidence
fully
determined
that
if
his
plan
did
not
succeed
the
failure
should
be
attributed
to
himself
alone
at
the
usual
hour
of
separation
for
the
night
tom
saw
from
his
concealment
the
lieutenant
enter
his
room
and
after
taking
a
few
turns
in
it
with
an
expression
so
joyous
as
to
betoken
that
his
thoughts
were
mainly
occupied
by
his
approaching
happiness
proceed
slowly
to
disrobe
himself
the
coat
the
waistcoat
the
black
silk
stock
were
gradually
discarded
the
green
morocco
slippers
were
kicked
off
and
then
ay
and
then
his
countenance
grew
grave
it
seemed
to
occur
to
him
all
at
once
that
this
was
his
last
stake
nay
that
the
very
breeches
he
had
on
were
not
his
own
that
morning
was
his
last
and
that
if
he
lost
a
glance
showed
that
his
mind
was
made
up
he
replaced
the
single
button
he
had
just
subducted
and
threw
himself
upon
the
bed
in
a
state
of
transition
half
chrysalis
half
grub
wearily
did
tom
ingoldsby
watch
the
sleeper
by
the
flickering
light
of
the
till
the
clock
striking
one
induced
him
to
increase
the
narrow
opening
which
he
had
left
for
the
purpose
of
observation
the
motion
slight
as
it
was
seemed
to
attract
charles
attention
for
he
raised
himself
suddenly
to
a
sitting
posture
listened
for
a
moment
and
then
stood
upright
upon
the
floor
ingoldsby
was
on
the
point
of
discovering
himself
when
the
light
flashing
full
upon
his
countenance
he
perceived
that
though
his
eyes
were
open
their
sense
was
shut
that
he
was
yet
under
the
influence
of
sleep
seaforth
advanced
slowly
to
the
toilet
lit
his
candle
at
the
lamp
that
stood
on
it
then
going
back
to
the
bed
foot
appeared
to
search
eagerly
for
something
which
he
could
not
find
for
a
few
moments
he
seemed
restless
and
uneasy
walking
round
the
apartment
and
examining
the
chairs
till
coming
fully
in
front
of
a
large
that
flanked
the
he
paused
as
if
contemplating
his
figure
in
it
he
now
returned
towards
the
bed
put
on
his
slippers
and
with
cautious
and
stealthy
steps
proceeded
towards
the
little
arched
doorway
that
opened
on
the
private
staircase
as
he
drew
the
bolt
tom
ingoldsby
emerged
from
his
but
the
heard
him
not
he
proceeded
softly
downstairs
followed
at
a
due
distance
by
his
friend
opened
the
door
which
led
out
upon
the
gardens
and
stood
at
once
among
the
thickest
of
the
shrubs
which
there
clustered
round
the
base
of
a
corner
turret
and
screened
the
postern
from
common
observation
at
this
moment
ingoldsby
had
nearly
spoiled
all
by
making
a
false
step
the
sound
attracted
seaforth
attention
he
paused
and
turned
and
as
the
full
moon
shed
her
light
directly
upon
his
pale
and
troubled
features
tom
marked
almost
with
dismay
the
fixed
and
rayless
appearance
of
his
eyes
there
was
no
speculation
in
those
orbs
that
he
did
glare
withal
the
perfect
stillness
preserved
by
his
follower
seemed
to
reassure
him
he
turned
aside
and
from
the
midst
of
a
thickest
laurustinus
drew
forth
a
gardener
spade
shouldering
which
he
proceeded
with
great
rapidity
into
the
midst
of
the
shrubbery
arrived
at
a
certain
point
where
the
earth
seemed
to
have
been
recently
disturbed
he
set
himself
heartily
to
the
task
of
digging
till
having
thrown
up
several
shovelfuls
of
mould
he
stopped
flung
down
his
tool
and
very
composedly
began
to
disencumber
himself
of
his
pantaloons
up
to
this
moment
tom
had
watched
him
with
a
wary
eye
he
now
advanced
cautiously
and
as
his
friend
was
busily
engaged
in
disentangling
himself
from
his
garment
made
himself
master
of
the
spade
seaforth
meanwhile
had
accomplished
his
purpose
he
stood
for
a
moment
with
his
streamers
waving
in
the
wind
occupied
in
carefully
rolling
up
the
into
as
compact
a
form
as
possible
and
all
heedless
of
the
breath
of
heaven
which
might
certainly
be
supposed
at
such
a
moment
and
in
such
a
plight
to
visit
his
frame
too
roughly
he
was
in
the
act
of
stooping
low
to
deposit
the
pantaloons
in
the
grave
which
he
had
been
digging
for
them
when
tom
ingoldsby
came
close
behind
him
and
with
the
flat
side
of
the
spade
the
shock
was
effectual
never
again
was
lieutenant
seaforth
known
to
act
the
part
of
a
somnambulist
one
by

his
breeches
his

his
pantaloons
his
tights
his
patent
cords
his
showy
greys
with
the
broad
red
stripe
of
the
bombay
fencibles
were
brought
to
light
rescued
from
the
grave
in
which
they
had
been
buried
like
the
strata
of
a
christmas
pie
and
after
having
been
well
aired
by

soon
returned

of

has
shown
no
disposition
to

or

out
of
doors
o
nights
though
from
his
entire
devotion
to
every
wish
and
whim
of
his
young
wife
tom
insinuates
that
the
fair
caroline
does
still
occasionally
take
advantage
of
it
so
far
as
to
slip
on
the
breeches
in
the
barn
by
burges
johnson
from
the
june
by
permission
of
the
century
company
and
burges
johnson
in
the
barn
by
burges
johnson
the
moment
we
had
entered
the
barn
i
regretted
the
rash
good
nature
which
prompted
me
to
consent
to
the
plans
of
those
vivacious
young
students
miss
anstell
and
miss
royce
and
one
or
two
others
often
leaders
in
student
mischief
i
suspect
were
the
first
to
enter
and
they
amused
themselves
by
hiding
in
the
darkness
and
greeting
the
rest
of
our
party
as
we
entered
with
sundry
shrieks
and
moans
such
as
are
commonly
attributed
to
ghosts
my
wife
and
i
brought
up
the
rear
carrying
the
two
farm
lanterns
she
had
selected
the
place
after
an
amused
consideration
of
the
question
and
i
confess
i
hardly
approved
her
judgment
but
she
is
native
to
this
part
of
the
country
and
she
had
assured
us
that
there
were
some
vague
traditions
hanging
about
the
building
that
made
it
most
suitable
for
our
purposes
it
was
a
musty
old
place
without
even
as
much
tidiness
as
is
usually
found
in
barns
and
there
was
a
dank
smell
about
it
as
though
generations
of
haymows
had
decayed
there
there
were
holes
in
the
floor
and
in
the
dusk
of
early
evening
it
was
necessary
for
us
to
pick
our
way
with
the
greatest
care
it
occurred
to
me
then
in
a
premonitory
sort
of
way
that
if
some
young
woman
student
sprained
her
ankle
in
this
absurd
environment
i
should
be
most
embarrassed
to
explain
it
apparently
it
was
a
hay
barn
whose
vague
dimensions
were
lost
in
shadow
rafters
crossed
its
width
about
twenty
feet
above
our
heads
and
here
and
there
a
few
boards
lay
across
the
rafters
furnishing
foothold
for
anyone
who
might
wish
to
operate
the
ancient
pulley
that
was
doubtless
once
used
for
lifting
bales
the
northern
half
of
the
floor
was
covered
with
hay
to
a
depth
of
two
or
three
feet
how
long
it
had
actually
been
there
i
can
not
imagine
it
was
extremely
dusty
and
i
feared
a
recurrence
of
my
old
enemy
hay
fever
but
it
was
too
late
to
offer
objection
on
such
grounds
and
my
wife
and
i
followed
our
chattering
guides
who
disposed
themselves
here
and
there
on
this
ancient
bed
of
hay
and
insisted
that
we
should
find
places
in
the
center
of
their
circle
at
my
suggestion
the
two
farm
lanterns
had
been
left
at
a
suitable
distance
in
fact
quite
at
the
other
side
of
the
barn
and
our
only
light
came
from
the
rapidly
falling
twilight
of
outdoors
which
found
its
way
through
a
little
window
and
sundry
cracks
high
in
the
eaves
above
the
rafters
there
was
something
about
the
place
now
that
we
were
settled
and
no
longer
occupied
with
adjustments
of
comfort
that
subdued
our
spirits
and
it
was
with
much
less
hilarity
that
the
young
people
united
in
demanding
a
story
i
looked
across
at
my
wife
whose
face
was
faintly
visible
within
the
circle
i
thought
that
even
in
the
i
glimpsed
the
same
expression
of
amused
incredulity
which
she
had
worn
earlier
in
the
day
when
i
had
yielded
to
the
importunities
of
a
deputation
of
my
students
for
this
party
on
the
eve
of
a
holiday
there
is
no
reason
i
thought
to
myself
repeating
the
phrases
i
had
used
then
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
not
tell
a
ghost
story
true
i
had
never
done
so
before
but
the
literary
attainments
which
have
enabled
me
to
perfect
my
recent
treatise
upon
the
of
the
comma
are
quite
equal
to
impromptu
experimentation
in
the
field
of
psychic
phenomena
i
was
aware
that
the
young
people
themselves
hardly
expected
serious
acquiescence
and
that
too
stimulated
me
i
cleared
my
throat
in
a
prefatory
manner
and
silence
fell
upon
the
group
a
light
breeze
had
risen
outside
and
the
timbers
of
the
barn
creaked
persistently
from
the
shadows
almost
directly
overhead
there
came
a
faint
clanking
it
was
evidently
caused
by
the
rusty
which
i
had
observed
there
as
we
entered
an
iron
hook
at
the
end
of
an
ancient
rope
still
depended
from
it
and
swung
in
the
lightly
stirring
air
several
feet
above
our
heads
directly
over
the
center
of
our
circle
some
curious
combination
of
influences
perhaps
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
added
to
the
stimulation
of
the
faintly
discernible
faces
around
me
and
my
impulse
to
prove
my
own
ability
in
this
untried
field
of
narration
gave
me
a
sudden
sense
of
being
inspired
i
found
myself
voicing
fancies
as
though
they
were
facts
and
readily
including
imaginary
names
and
data
which
certainly
were
not
in
any
way
premeditated
this
barn
stands
on
the
old
creed
place
i
began
peter
creed
was
its
last
owner
but
i
suppose
that
it
has
always
been
and
always
will
be
known
as
the
turner
barn
a
few
yards
away
to
the
south
you
will
find
the
crumbling
and
gaping
hollows
of
an
old
foundation
now
overgrown
with
weeds
that
almost
conceal
a
few
charred
timbers
that
is
all
that
is
left
of
the
old
ashley
turner
house
i
cleared
my
throat
again
not
through
any
effort
to
gain
time
for
my
thoughts
but
to
feel
for
a
moment
the
satisfaction
arising
from
the
intent
attitude
of
my
audience
particularly
my
wife
who
had
leaned
forward
and
was
looking
at
me
with
an
expression
of
startled
surprise
ashley
turner
must
have
had
a
pretty
farm
here
thirty
years
or
so
ago
i
continued
when
he
brought
his
wife
to
it
this
barn
was
new
then
but
he
was
a
with
nothing
to
be
said
in
his
favor
unless
you
admit
his
fame
as
a
practical
joker
strange
how
the
is
often
equipped
with
an
extravagant
sense
of
humor
turner
had
a
considerable
retinue
among
the
riffraff
boys
of
the
neighborhood
who
made
this
barn
a
noisy
rendezvous
and
followed
his
hints
in
much
whimsical
mischief
but
he
committed
most
of
his
practical
jokes
when
drunk
and
in
his
sober
moments
he
abused
his
family
and
let
his
wife
struggle
to
keep
up
the
acres
assisted
only
by
a
man
of
all
work
finally
he
took
to
roving
no
one
knew
how
he
got
his
wife
could
not
have
given
him
any
then
someone
discovered
that
he
was
going
over
to
creed
now
and
then
and
everything
was
explained
this
concise
data
of
mine
was
evidently
not
holding
the
close
attention
of
my
youthful
audience
they
annoyed
me
by
frequent
pranks
and
whisperings
no
one
could
have
been
more
surprised
at
my
glibness
than
i
myself
except
perhaps
my
wife
whose
attitude
of
strained
attention
had
not
relaxed
i
resumed
my
story
peter
creed
was
a
good
usurer
of
the
worst
type
he
went
to
church
regularly
one
day
in
the
week
and
gouged
his
neighbors
any
that
he
could
get
into
his
clutches
on
the
other
six
he
must
have
been
lending
turner
drinking
money
and
everyone
knew
what
the
security
must
be
at
last
there
came
a
day
when
the
wife
revolted
turner
had
come
home
extra
drunk
and
in
his
most
maudlin
humor
probably
he
attempted
some
drunken
prank
upon
his
helpmate
old
ike
the
hired
man
said
that
he
thought
turner
had
rigged
up
some
scare
for
her
in
the
barn
and
that
he
had
never
heard
anything
so
much
like
straight
talking
from
his
mistress
either
before
or
since
and
he
was
working
in
the
woodshed
at
the
time
with
the
door
shut
shortly
after
that
tirade
ashley
turner
disappeared
and
no
one
saw
or
heard
of
him
or
thought
about
him
for
a
couple
of
years
except
when
the
sight
of
his
wife
and
scrawny
children
revived
the
recollection
at
last
on
a
certain
autumn
day
old
peter
creed
turned
up
here
at
the
turner
place
i
imagine
turner
knew
what
was
in
store
for
her
when
his
rusty
buggy
came
in
sight
around
the
corner
of
the
barn
at
any
rate
she
made
no
protest
and
listened
meekly
to
his
curt
statement
that
he
held
an
overdue
mortgage
with
plenty
of
back
interest
owing
and
it
was
time
for
her
to
go
she
went
neither
she
nor
anyone
else
doubted
creed
rights
in
the
matter
and
after
all
i
believe
it
got
a
better
home
for
her
somewhere
in
the
long
run
i
paused
here
in
my
narration
to
draw
breath
and
readjust
my
leg
which
had
become
cramped
there
was
a
general
readjustment
and
shifting
of
position
with
some
levity
it
was
darker
now
the
rafters
above
us
were
invisible
and
the
faces
about
me
looked
oddly
white
against
the
shadowy
background
after
a
moment
or
two
of
delay
i
cleared
my
throat
sharply
and
continued
old
creed
came
thus
into
possession
of
this
place
just
as
he
had
come
to
own
a
dozen
others
in
the
county
he
usually
lived
on
one
until
he
was
able
to
sell
it
at
a
good
profit
over
his
investment
so
he
settled
down
in
the
turner
house
and
kept
old
ike
because
he
worked
for
little
or
nothing
but
he
seemed
to
have
a
hard
time
finding
a
purchaser
it
must
have
been
about
a
year
later
when
an
unexpected
thing
happened
creed
had
come
out
here
to
the
barn
to
lock
up
he
always
did
that
himself
when
he
noticed
something
unusual
about
the
haymow
this
haymow
which
stood
then
about
six
feet
above
the
barn
floor
he
looked
closer
through
the
dusk
and
saw
a
pair
of
boots
went
nearer
and
found
that
they
were
fitted
to
a
pair
of
human
legs
whose
owner
was
sound
asleep
in
his
hay
creed
picked
up
a
short
stick
and
beat
on
one
boot
out
of
here
he
said
i
have
you
locked
up
the
sleeper
woke
in
slow
fashion
sat
up
grinned
and
said
peter
creed
it
was
ashley
turner
beyond
question
creed
stepped
back
a
pace
or
two
and
seemed
at
a
loss
for
words
an
object
slipped
from
turner
pocket
as
he
moved
slid
along
the
hay
and
fell
to
the
barn
floor
it
was
a
no
one
knows
full
details
of
the
conversation
that
ensued
of
course
such
little
as
i
am
able
to
tell
you
of
what
was
said
and
done
comes
through
old
ike
who
watched
from
a
safe
distance
outside
the
barn
ready
to
act
at
a
moment
notice
as
best
suited
his
own
safety
and
welfare
of
one
thing
ike
was
certain
creed
lacked
his
usual
browbeating
manner
he
was
apparently
struggling
to
assume
an
unwonted
friendliness
turner
was
very
drunk
but
triumphant
and
his
satisfaction
over
what
he
must
have
felt
was
the
practical
joke
of
his
life
seemed
to
make
him
friendly
kept
all
right
he
said
again
and
again
got
the
proof
i
was
working
for
nothing
all
these
months
i
ai
fool
enough
yet
to
throw
away
papers
even
when
i
drunk
to
the
watchful
ike
astonishment
creed
evidently
tried
to
persuade
him
to
come
into
the
house
for
something
to
eat
turner
slid
off
the
haymow
found
his
steps
too
unsteady
laughed
foolishly
and
suggested
that
creed
bring
some
food
to
him
there
i
got
a
right
to
sleep
in
the
barn
or
house
whichever
i
want
he
said
leering
into
creed
face
the
old
usurer
stood
there
for
a
few
minutes
eying
turner
thoughtfully
then
he
actually
gave
him
a
shoulder
back
onto
the
hay
said
something
about
finding
a
snack
of
supper
and
started
out
of
the
barn
in
the
doorway
he
turned
looked
back
then
walked
over
to
the
edge
of
the
mow
and
groped
on
the
floor
until
he
found
the
picked
it
up
tossed
it
into
turner
lap
and
stumbled
out
of
the
barn
again
i
was
becoming
interested
in
my
own
story
and
somewhat
pleased
with
the
fluency
of
it
but
my
audience
annoyed
me
there
was
intermittent
whispering
with
some
laughter
and
i
inferred
that
one
or
another
would
occasionally
stimulate
this
inattention
by
tickling
a
companion
with
a
straw
miss
anstell
who
is
so
frivolous
by
nature
that
i
sometimes
question
her
right
to
a
place
in
my
classroom
i
even
suspected
of
irritating
the
back
of
my
own
neck
in
the
same
fashion
naturally
i
ignored
it
peter
creed
i
repeated
went
into
the
house
ike
hung
around
the
barn
waiting
he
was
frankly
curious
in
a
few
minutes
his
employer
reappeared
carrying
a
plate
heaped
with
an
assortment
of
scraps
ike
peered
and
listened
then
without
compunction
the
best
i
got
he
heard
creed
say
grudgingly
turner
tones
were
now
more
drunkenly
belligerent
had
better
be
he
said
loudly
i
take
the
best
bed
after
evidently
he
was
eating
and
muttering
between
mouthfuls
might
have
brought
me
another
bottle
did
said
creed
to
the
listening
ike
great
astonishment
turner
laughed
immoderately
a
long
silence
followed
turner
was
either
eating
or
drinking
then
he
spoke
again
more
thickly
and
drowsily
unpleasant
that
rope
why
do
you
haul
it
up
out
of
my
way
do
hurt
you
any
said
creed
you
wish
it
would
said
turner
with
drunken
shrewdness
i
do
like
it
haul
it
away
will
said
creed
there
was
a
longer
silence
and
then
there
came
an
intermittent
rasping
sound
a
moment
later
creed
came
suddenly
from
the
barn
ike
fumbled
with
a
large
rake
and
made
as
though
to
hang
it
on
its
accustomed
peg
near
the
barn
door
creed
eyed
him
sharply
along
to
bed
he
ordered
and
ike
obeyed
that
was
a
saturday
night
on
sunday
morning
ike
went
to
the
barn
later
than
usual
and
hesitatingly
even
then
he
was
first
to
enter
he
found
the
drunkard
body
hanging
here
over
the
mow
just
about
where
we
are
sitting
stark
and
cold
it
was
a
gruesome
end
to
a
miserable
my
audience
was
quiet
enough
now
miss
anstell
and
one
or
two
others
giggled
loudly
but
it
was
obviously
forced
and
found
no
further
echo
the
breeze
which
had
sprung
up
some
time
before
was
producing
strange
creakings
and
raspings
in
the
old
timbers
and
the
far
above
us
clanked
with
a
dismal
repetitious
sound
like
the
tolling
of
a
cracked
bell
i
waited
a
moment
well
satisfied
with
the
effect
and
then
continued
the
coroner
jury
found
it
suicide
though
some
shook
their
heads
meaningly
turner
had
apparently
sobered
up
enough
to
stand
and
making
a
simple
loop
around
his
neck
by
catching
the
rope
through
its
own
hook
had
then
slid
off
the
mow
the
rope
which
went
over
the
up
there
in
the
roof
ran
out
through
a
window
under
the
eaves
and
was
made
fast
near
the
barn
door
outside
where
anyone
could
haul
on
it
creed
testified
the
knot
was
one
he
had
tied
many
days
before
ike
was
a
timorous
old
man
with
a
wholesome
fear
of
his
employer
and
he
supported
the
testimony
and
made
no
reference
to
his
eavesdropping
of
the
previous
evening
though
he
heard
creed
swear
before
the
jury
that
he
did
not
recognize
the
tramp
he
had
fed
and
lodged
there
were
no
papers
in
turner
pockets
only
a
few
coins
and
a
marked
that
gave
the
first
clue
to
his
identity
a
few
of
the
neighbors
said
that
it
was
a
fitting
end
and
that
the
verdict
was
a
just
one
nevertheless
whisperings
began
and
increased
people
avoided
creed
and
the
neighborhood
rumors
grew
that
the
barn
was
haunted
on
the
road
after
dark
said
they
heard
the
old
clanking
when
no
breeze
stirred
much
as
you
hear
it
now
some
claim
to
have
heard
maudlin
laughter
possible
purchasers
were
frightened
away
and
creed
grew
more
and
more
solitary
and
misanthropic
old
ike
hung
on
heaven
knows
why
though
i
suppose
creed
paid
him
some
sort
of
wage
rumors
grew
folks
said
that
neither
ike
nor
creed
entered
this
barn
after
a
time
and
no
hay
was
put
in
though
creed
would
not
have
been
creed
if
he
had
not
sold
off
the
bulk
of
what
he
had
ghost
or
no
ghost
i
can
imagine
him
slowly
forking
it
out
alone
daytimes
and
the
amount
of
hay
still
here
proves
that
even
he
finally
lost
courage
i
paused
a
moment
but
though
there
was
much
uneasy
stirring
about
and
the
dismal
clanking
directly
above
us
was
incessant
no
one
of
my
audience
spoke
it
was
wholly
dark
now
and
i
think
all
had
drawn
closer
together
about
ten
years
ago
people
began
calling
creed
crazy
here
i
was
forced
to
interrupt
my
own
story
i
shall
have
to
ask
you
miss
anstell
to
stop
annoying
me
i
have
been
aware
for
some
moments
that
you
are
brushing
my
head
with
a
straw
but
i
have
ignored
it
for
the
sake
of
the
others
out
of
the
darkness
came
miss
anstell
voice
protesting
earnestly
and
i
realized
from
the
direction
of
the
sound
that
in
the
general
readjustment
she
must
have
settled
down
in
the
very
center
of
our
circle
and
could
not
be
the
one
at
fault
one
of
the
others
was
childish
enough
to
simulate
a
mocking
burst
of
raucous
laughter
but
i
chose
to
ignore
it
very
well
said
i
graciously
shall
i
go
on
go
on
echoed
a
subdued
chorus
it
was
the
night
of
the
of
may
ten
years
ago
not
the
broke
in
my
wife
voice
sharply
that
is
date
there
was
a
note
in
her
voice
that
i
hardly
recognized
but
it
indicated
that
she
was
in
some
way
affected
by
my
narration
and
i
felt
a
distinct
sense
of
triumph
it
was
the
night
of
may
i
repeated
firmly
are
you
making
up
this
story
my
wife
voice
continued
still
with
the
same
odd
tone
i
am
my
dear
and
you
are
interrupting
it
but
an
ashley
turner
and
later
a
peter
creed
owned
this
place
she
persisted
almost
in
a
whisper
and
i
am
sure
you
never
heard
of
them
i
confess
that
i
might
wisely
have
broken
off
my
story
then
and
called
for
a
light
there
had
been
an
hysterical
note
in
my
wife
voice
and
i
was
startled
at
her
words
for
i
had
no
conscious
recollection
of
either
name
yet
i
felt
a
resultant
exhilaration
our
lanterns
had
grown
strangely
dim
though
i
was
certain
both
had
been
recently
trimmed
and
filled
and
from
their
far
corner
of
the
barn
they
threw
no
light
whatever
into
our
circle
i
faced
an
utter
blackness
on
that
night
said
i
old
ike
was
wakened
by
sounds
as
of
someone
fumbling
to
unbar
and
open
the
housedoor
it
was
an
unwonted
hour
and
he
peered
from
the
window
of
his
little
room
by
the
dim
starlight
it
was
just
before
dawn
he
could
see
all
of
the
open
yard
and
roadway
before
the
house
with
the
great
barn
looming
like
a
black
and
sinister
shadow
as
its
farther
barrier
crossing
this
space
he
saw
the
figure
of
peter
creed
grotesquely
stooped
and
old
in
the
obscuring
gloom
moving
slowly
almost
gropingly
and
yet
directly
as
though
impelled
toward
the
barn
overwhelming
shadow
slowly
he
unbarred
the
great
door
swung
it
open
and
entered
the
blacker
shadows
it
concealed
the
door
closed
after
him
ike
in
his
secure
post
of
observation
did
not
stir
he
could
not
even
to
his
crude
imagining
there
was
something
utterly
horrible
in
the
thought
of
creed
alone
at
that
hour
in
just
such
black
darkness
as
this
with
the
great
timbered
chamber
haunted
at
least
by
its
dread
memories
he
could
only
wait
tense
and
fearful
of
he
knew
not
what
a
shriek
that
pierced
the
silence
relaxed
his
tension
bringing
almost
a
sense
of
relief
so
definite
had
been
his
expectancy
but
it
was
a
burst
of
shrill
laughter
ribald
uncanny
undeniable
accompanying
the
shriek
that
gave
him
power
of
motion
he
ran
half
naked
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
the
nearest
neighbor
and
told
his
story
they
found
creed
hanging
the
rope
hooked
simply
around
his
neck
it
was
a
silent
jury
that
filed
from
the
barn
that
morning
after
viewing
the
body
said
they
after
ike
shivering
and
stammering
had
testified
harking
back
to
the
untold
evidence
of
that
other
morning
years
before
yes
creed
was
dead
with
a
terrible
look
on
his
wizen
face
and
the
dusty
old
rope
ran
through
its
and
was
fast
to
a
beam
high
above
must
of
climbed
to
the
beam
made
the
rope
fast
and
jumped
said
the
foreman
solemnly
must
of
he
must
of
repeated
the
man
while
the
sweat
stood
out
on
his
forehead
there
was
no
other
way
but
as
god
is
my
judge
the
knot
in
the
rope
and
the
dust
on
the
beam
ai
been
disturbed
for
years
at
this
dramatic
climax
there
was
an
audible
sigh
from
my
audience
i
sat
quietly
for
a
time
content
to
allow
the
silence
and
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
which
actually
seemed
surcharged
with
influences
not
of
my
creation
to
add
to
the
effect
my
story
had
caused
there
was
scarcely
a
movement
in
our
circle
of
that
i
felt
sure
and
yet
once
more
out
of
the
almost
tangible
darkness
above
me
something
seemed
to
reach
down
and
brush
against
my
head
a
slight
motion
of
air
sufficient
to
disturb
my
rather
scanty
locks
was
additional
proof
that
i
was
the
butt
of
some
prank
that
had
just
missed
its
objective
then
with
a
fearful
suddenness
close
to
my
ear
burst
a
shrill
discord
of
laughter
so
uncanny
and
so
unlike
the
usual
sound
of
student
merriment
that
i
started
up
half
wondering
if
i
had
heard
it
almost
immediately
after
it
the
heavy
darkness
was
torn
again
by
a
shriek
so
terrible
in
its
intensity
as
completely
to
differentiate
it
from
the
other
cries
which
followed
bring
a
light
cried
a
voice
that
i
recognized
as
that
of
my
wife
though
strangely
distorted
by
emotion
there
was
a
great
confusion
young
women
struggled
from
their
places
and
impeded
one
another
in
the
darkness
but
finally
and
it
seemed
an
unbearable
delay
someone
brought
a
single
lantern
its
frail
light
revealed
miss
anstell
half
upright
from
her
place
in
the
center
of
our
circle
my
wife
arms
sustaining
her
weight
her
face
as
well
as
i
could
see
it
seemed
darkened
and
distorted
and
when
we
forced
her
clutching
hands
away
from
her
bared
throat
we
could
see
even
in
that
light
the
marks
of
an
angry
throttling
scar
entirely
encircling
it
just
above
her
head
the
old
swayed
menacingly
in
the
faint
breeze
my
recollection
is
even
now
confused
as
to
the
following
moments
and
our
stumbling
escape
from
that
gruesome
spot
miss
anstell
is
now
at
her
home
recovering
from
what
her
physician
calls
mental
shock
my
wife
will
not
speak
of
it
the
questions
i
would
ask
her
are
checked
on
my
lips
by
the
look
of
utter
terror
in
her
eyes
as
i
have
confessed
to
you
my
own
philosophy
is
hard
put
to
it
to
withstand
not
so
much
the
community
attitude
toward
what
they
are
pleased
to
call
my
taste
in
practical
joking
but
to
assemble
and
adjust
the
facts
of
my
experience
a
shady
plot
by
elsie
brown
this
story
was
submitted
as
a
class
exercise
in
one
of
my
classes
at
columbia
university
at
my
request
the
author
elsie
brown
contributed
it
to
this
volume
a
shady
plot
by
elsie
brown
so
i
sat
down
to
write
a
ghost
story
jenkins
was
responsible
hallock
he
had
said
to
me
give
us
another
on
the
supernatural
this
time
something
to
give
the
horrors
that
what
the
public
wants
and
your
ghosts
are
live
propositions
well
i
was
in
no
position
to
contradict
jenkins
for
as
yet
his
magazine
had
been
the
only
one
to
print
my
stuff
so
i
had
said
precisely
in
the
deepest
voice
i
was
capable
of
and
had
gone
out
i
had
the
shade
of
an
idea
but
at
the
time
that
did
worry
me
in
the
least
you
see
i
had
often
been
like
that
before
and
in
the
end
things
had
always
come
my
way
i
did
in
the
least
know
how
or
why
it
had
all
been
rather
mysterious
you
understand
i
did
specialize
in
ghost
stories
but
more
or
less
they
seemed
to
specialize
in
me
a
ghost
story
had
been
the
first
fiction
i
had
written
curious
how
that
idea
for
a
plot
had
come
to
me
out
of
nowhere
after
i
had
chased
inspiration
in
vain
for
months
even
now
whenever
jenkins
wanted
a
ghost
he
called
on
me
and
i
had
never
found
it
healthy
to
contradict
jenkins
jenkins
always
seemed
to
have
an
uncanny
knowledge
as
to
when
the
landlord
or
the
grocer
were
pestering
me
and
he
dunned
me
for
a
ghost
and
somehow
i
always
been
able
to
dig
one
up
for
him
so
i
begun
to
get
a
bit
cocky
as
to
my
ability
so
i
went
home
and
sat
down
before
my
desk
and
sucked
at
the
end
of
my
pencil
and
waited
but
nothing
happened
pretty
soon
my
mind
began
to
wander
off
on
other
things
decidedly
unghostly
and
material
things
such
as
my
wife
shopping
and
how
on
earth
i
was
going
to
cure
her
of
her
alarming
tendency
to
take
every
new
fad
that
came
along
and
work
it
to
death
but
i
realized
would
never
get
me
any
place
so
i
went
back
to
staring
at
the
ceiling
this
writing
business
delightful
is
it
i
said
sarcastically
at
last
out
loud
too
you
see
i
had
reached
the
stage
of
imbecility
when
i
was
talking
to
myself
yes
said
a
voice
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
i
should
say
it
is
i
admit
i
jumped
then
i
looked
around
it
was
twilight
by
this
time
and
i
had
forgotten
to
turn
on
the
lamp
the
other
end
of
the
room
was
full
of
shadows
and
furniture
i
sat
staring
at
it
and
presently
noticed
something
just
taking
shape
it
was
exactly
like
watching
one
of
these
moving
picture
cartoons
being
put
together
first
an
arm
came
out
then
a
bit
of
sleeve
of
a
stiff
white
shirtwaist
then
a
leg
and
a
plaid
skirt
until
at
last
there
she
was
complete
whoever
she
was
she
was
long
and
angular
with
enormous
fishy
eyes
behind
big
spectacles
and
her
hair
in
a
tight
wad
at
the
back
of
her
head
yes
i
seemed
able
to
see
right
through
her
head
and
a
jaw
well
it
looked
so
solid
that
for
the
moment
i
began
to
doubt
my
very
own
senses
and
believe
she
was
real
after
all
she
came
over
and
stood
in
front
of
me
and
glared
yes
positively
glared
down
at
me
although
to
my
knowledge
i
had
never
laid
eyes
on
the
woman
before
to
say
nothing
of
giving
her
cause
to
look
at
me
like
that
i
sat
still
feeling
pretty
helpless
i
can
tell
you
and
at
last
she
barked
what
are
you
gaping
at
i
swallowed
though
i
had
been
chewing
anything
nothing
i
said
absolutely
nothing
my
dear
lady
i
was
merely
waiting
for
you
to
tell
me
why
you
had
come
and
excuse
me
but
do
you
always
come
in
sections
like
this
i
should
think
your
parts
might
get
mixed
up
sometimes
did
you
send
for
me
she
crisped
imagine
how
i
felt
at
that
why
no
i
i
do
seem
to
remember
look
here
have
you
been
calling
on
heaven
and
earth
all
afternoon
to
help
you
write
a
story
i
nodded
and
then
a
possible
explanation
occurred
to
me
and
my
spine
got
cold
suppose
this
was
the
ghost
of
a
stenographer
applying
for
a
job
i
had
had
an
advertisement
in
the
paper
recently
i
opened
my
mouth
to
explain
that
the
position
was
filled
and
permanently
so
but
she
stopped
me
and
when
i
got
back
to
the
office
from
my
last
case
and
was
ready
for
you
did
you
switch
off
to
something
else
and
sit
there
driveling
so
i
could
attract
your
attention
until
just
now
i
i
very
sorry
really
well
you
need
be
because
i
just
came
to
tell
you
to
stop
bothering
us
for
assistance
you
ai
going
to
get
it
we
going
on
strike
what
you
do
have
to
yell
at
me
i
i
did
mean
to
yell
i
said
humbly
but
i
afraid
i
quite
understand
you
you
said
you
were
going
on
strike
do
you
know
what
a
strike
is
not
another
plot
do
you
get
from
us
i
stared
at
her
and
wet
my
lips
is
is
that
where
they
been
coming
from
of
course
where
else
but
my
ghosts
are
a
bit
like
you
if
they
were
people
would
believe
in
them
she
draped
herself
on
the
top
of
my
desk
among
the
pens
and
ink
bottles
and
leaned
towards
me
in
the
other
life
used
to
write
you
did
she
nodded
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
my
present
form
it
might
have
but
i
gave
it
up
at
last
for
that
very
reason
and
went
to
work
as
a
reader
on
a
magazine
she
sighed
and
rubbed
the
end
of
her
long
eagle
nose
with
a
reminiscent
finger
those
were
terrible
days
the
memory
of
them
made
me
mistake
purgatory
for
paradise
and
at
last
when
i
attained
my
present
state
of
being
i
made
up
my
mind
that
something
should
be
done
i
found
others
who
had
suffered
similarly
and
between
us
we
organized
writer
inspiration
bureau
we
scout
around
until
we
find
a
writer
without
ideas
and
with
a
mind
soft
enough
to
accept
impression
the
case
is
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
main
office
and
one
of
us
assigned
to
it
when
that
case
is
finished
we
bring
in
a
report
but
i
never
saw
you
before
and
you
would
have
this
time
if
i
had
come
to
announce
the
strike
many
a
time
i
leaned
on
your
shoulder
when
you
thought
were
thinking
hard
i
groaned
and
clutched
my
hair
the
very
idea
of
that
horrible
scarecrow
so
much
as
touching
me
and
would
my
wife
be
shocked
i
shivered
but
she
continued
that
at
an
end
we
been
called
out
of
our
beds
a
little
too
often
in
recent
years
and
now
we
through
but
my
dear
madam
i
assure
you
i
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
i
hope
i
properly
grateful
and
all
that
you
see
oh
it
is
you
she
explained
patronizingly
it
those
ouija
board
fanatics
there
was
a
time
when
we
had
nothing
much
to
occupy
us
and
used
to
haunt
a
little
on
the
side
purely
for
amusement
but
not
any
more
we
had
to
give
up
haunting
almost
entirely
we
sit
at
a
desk
and
answer
questions
now
and
such
questions
she
shook
her
head
hopelessly
and
taking
off
her
glasses
wiped
them
and
put
them
back
on
her
nose
again
but
what
have
i
got
to
do
with
this
she
gave
me
a
pitying
look
and
rose
you
to
exert
your
influence
get
all
your
friends
and
acquaintances
to
stop
using
the
ouija
board
and
then
we
start
helping
you
to
write
but
there
was
a
footstep
outside
my
door
john
oh
john
called
the
voice
of
my
wife
i
waved
my
arms
at
the
ghost
with
something
of
the
motion
of
a
beginner
when
learning
to
swim
madam
i
must
ask
you
to
leave
and
at
once
consider
the
impression
if
you
were
seen
here
the
ghost
nodded
and
began
very
sensibly
i
thought
to
demobilize
and
evaporate
first
the
brogans
on
her
feet
grew
misty
until
i
could
see
the
floor
through
them
then
the
affection
spread
to
her
knees
and
gradually
extended
upward
by
this
time
my
wife
was
opening
the
door
do
forget
the
strike
she
repeated
while
her
lower
jaw
began
to
disintegrate
and
as
my
lavinia
crossed
the
room
to
me
the
last
vestige
of
her
ear
faded
into
space
john
why
in
the
world
are
you
sitting
in
the
dark
just
thinking
my
dear
thinking
rubbish
you
were
talking
out
loud
i
remained
silent
while
she
lit
the
lamps
thankful
that
her
back
was
turned
to
me
when
i
am
nervous
or
excited
there
is
a
muscle
in
my
face
that
starts
to
twitch
and
this
pulls
up
one
corner
of
my
mouth
and
gives
the
appearance
of
an
idiotic
grin
so
far
i
had
managed
to
conceal
this
affliction
from
lavinia
you
know
i
bought
the
loveliest
thing
this
afternoon
everybody
wild
over
them
i
remembered
her
craze
for
taking
up
new
fads
and
a
premonitory
chill
crept
up
the
back
of
my
neck
it
it
is
i
began
and
stopped
i
simply
could
ask
the
possibility
was
too
horrible
you
never
guess
in
the
world
it
the
duckiest
darlingest
ouija
board
and
so
cheap
i
got
it
at
a
bargain
sale
why
what
the
matter
john
i
felt
things
slipping
nothing
i
said
and
looked
around
for
the
ghost
suppose
she
had
lingered
and
upon
hearing
what
my
wife
had
said
should
suddenly
appear
like
all
sensitive
women
lavinia
was
subject
to
hysterics
but
you
looked
so
funny
i
i
always
do
when
i
interested
i
gulped
but
do
you
think
that
was
a
foolish
thing
to
buy
foolish
oh
john
foolish
and
after
me
getting
it
for
you
for
me
what
do
you
mean
to
help
you
write
your
stories
why
for
instance
suppose
you
wanted
to
write
an
historical
novel
you
would
have
to
wear
your
eyes
out
over
those
musty
old
books
in
the
public
library
all
you
have
to
do
would
be
to
get
out
your
ouija
and
talk
to
napoleon
or
william
the
conqueror
or
helen
of
troy
well
maybe
not
helen
anyhow
you
have
all
the
local
color
you
need
and
without
a
speck
of
trouble
and
think
how
easy
writing
your
short
stories
will
be
now
but
lavinia
you
surely
do
believe
in
ouija
boards
i
do
know
john
they
are
awfully
thrilling
she
had
seated
herself
on
the
arm
of
my
chair
and
was
looking
dreamily
across
the
room
i
started
and
turned
around
there
was
nothing
there
and
i
sank
back
with
relief
so
far
so
good
oh
certainly
they
thrilling
all
right
that
just
it
they
a
darn
sight
too
thrilling
they
positively
devilish
now
lavinia
you
have
plenty
of
sense
and
i
want
you
to
get
rid
of
that
thing
just
as
soon
as
you
can
take
it
back
and
get
something
else
my
wife
crossed
her
knees
and
stared
at
me
through
narrowed
lids
john
hallock
she
said
distinctly
i
do
propose
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
in
the
first
place
they
wo
exchange
things
bought
at
a
bargain
sale
and
in
the
second
if
you
are
interested
in
the
other
world
am
so
there
and
she
slid
down
and
walked
from
the
room
before
i
could
think
of
a
single
thing
to
say
she
walked
very
huffily
well
it
was
like
that
all
the
rest
of
the
evening
just
as
soon
as
i
mentioned
ouija
boards
i
felt
things
begin
to
cloud
up
so
i
decided
to
let
it
go
for
the
present
in
the
hope
that
she
might
be
more
reasonable
later
after
supper
i
had
another
try
at
the
writing
but
as
my
mind
continued
a
perfect
blank
i
gave
it
up
and
went
off
to
bed
the
next
day
was
saturday
and
it
being
near
the
end
of
the
month
and
a
particularly
busy
day
i
left
home
early
without
seeing
lavinia
understand
i
have
quite
reached
the
point
where
i
can
give
my
whole
time
to
writing
and
being
bookkeeper
for
a
lumber
company
does
help
with
the
grocery
bills
and
pay
for
lavinia
fancy
shopping
friday
had
been
a
half
holiday
and
of
course
when
i
got
back
the
work
was
piled
up
pretty
high
so
high
in
fact
that
ghosts
and
stories
and
everything
else
vanished
in
a
perfect
tangle
of
figures
when
i
got
off
the
street
car
that
evening
my
mind
was
still
churning
i
remember
now
that
i
noticed
even
from
the
corner
how
brightly
the
house
was
illuminated
but
at
the
time
that
did
mean
anything
to
me
i
recall
as
i
went
up
the
steps
and
opened
the
door
i
murmured
nine
times
nine
is
and
then
gladolia
met
me
in
the
hall
misto
hallock
de
missus
sho
you
lost
she
say
she
done
you
dis
mawnin
to
be
home
early
but
fo
de
lawd
sake
not
to
stop
to
argify
now
but
get
ready
fo
de
company
an
come
on
down
some
memory
of
a
message
given
me
by
one
of
the
clerks
filtered
back
through
my
brain
but
i
had
been
hunting
three
lost
receipts
at
the
time
and
had
completely
forgotten
it
company
i
said
stupidly
what
company
de
missus
ouija
boahrd
pahrty
said
gladolia
and
rolling
her
eyes
she
disappeared
in
the
direction
of
the
kitchen
i
must
have
gone
upstairs
and
dressed
and
come
down
again
for
i
presently
found
myself
standing
in
the
dimly
lighted
lower
hall
wearing
my
second
best
suit
and
a
fresh
shirt
and
collar
but
i
have
no
recollections
of
the
process
there
was
a
great
chattering
coming
from
our
little
parlor
and
i
went
over
to
the
door
and
peered
through
the
room
was
full
of
women
most
of
them
elderly
whom
i
recognized
as
belonging
to
my
wife
book
club
they
were
sitting
in
couples
and
between
each
couple
was
a
ouija
board
the
mournful
squeak
of
the
legs
of
the
moving
triangular
things
on
which
they
rested
their
fingers
filled
the
air
and
mixed
in
with
the
conversation
i
looked
around
for
the
ghost
with
my
heart
sunk
down
to
zero
what
if
lavinia
should
see
her
and
go
mad
before
my
eyes
and
then
my
wife
came
and
tapped
me
on
the
shoulder
john
she
said
in
her
sweetest
voice
and
i
noticed
that
her
cheeks
were
very
pink
and
her
eyes
very
bright
my
wife
is
never
so
pretty
as
when
she
doing
something
she
knows
i
disapprove
of
john
dear
i
know
you
help
us
out
william
augustus
wainright
at
the
last
moment
to
say
that
she
could
possibly
come
and
that
leaves
poor
laura
hinkle
without
a
partner
now
john
i
know
people
can
work
a
ouija
by
themselves
but
laura
ca
and
she
just
have
a
horrible
time
unless
you
me
i
gasped
me
i
wo
but
even
as
i
spoke
she
had
taken
my
arm
and
the
next
thing
i
knew
i
was
sitting
with
the
thing
on
my
knees
and
miss
laura
hinkle
opposite
grinning
in
my
face
like
a
flirtatious
crocodile
i
i
wo
i
began
now
hallock
do
you
be
shy
miss
laura
hinkle
leaned
forward
and
shook
a
bony
finger
almost
under
my
chin
i
i
not
only
i
say
i
wo
no
it
very
easy
really
you
just
put
the
tips
of
your
fingers
right
here
beside
the
tips
of
my
fingers
and
the
first
thing
i
knew
she
had
taken
my
hands
and
was
coyly
holding
them
in
the
position
desired
she
released
them
presently
and
the
little
board
began
to
slide
around
in
an
aimless
sort
of
way
there
seemed
to
be
some
force
tugging
it
about
i
looked
at
my
partner
first
with
suspicion
and
then
with
a
vast
relief
if
she
was
doing
it
then
all
that
talk
about
spirits
oh
i
did
hope
miss
laura
hinkle
was
cheating
with
that
board
ouija
dear
wo
you
tell
us
something
she
cooed
and
on
the
instant
the
thing
seemed
to
take
life
it
rushed
to
the
upper
left
hand
corner
of
the
board
and
hovered
with
its
front
leg
on
the
word
yes
then
it
began
to
fly
around
so
fast
that
i
gave
up
any
attempt
to
follow
it
my
companion
was
bending
forward
and
had
started
to
spell
out
loud
traitor
why
what
does
she
mean
i
do
know
i
said
desperately
my
collar
felt
very
tight
but
she
must
mean
something
ouija
dear
wo
you
explain
yourself
more
fully
ask
him
ask
who
ouija
i
i
going
i
choked
and
tried
to
get
up
but
my
fingers
seemed
stuck
to
that
dreadful
board
and
i
dropped
back
again
apparently
miss
hinkle
had
not
heard
my
protest
the
thing
was
going
around
faster
than
ever
and
she
was
reading
the
message
silently
with
her
brow
corrugated
and
the
light
of
the
huntress
in
her
pale
blue
eyes
why
she
says
it
you
hallock
what
she
mean
ouija
you
tell
us
who
is
talking
i
groaned
but
that
inexorable
board
continued
to
spell
i
always
did
hate
a
spelling
match
miss
hinkle
was
again
following
it
aloud
helen
she
raised
her
voice
until
it
could
be
heard
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
lavinia
dear
do
you
know
anyone
by
the
name
of
helen
by
the
name
of
i
ca
hear
you
and
my
wife
made
her
way
over
to
us
between
the
book
club
chairs
you
know
the
funniest
thing
has
happened
she
whispered
excitedly
someone
had
been
trying
to
communicate
with
john
through
and
sprinkle
ouija
someone
by
the
name
of
helen
why
that
curious
what
is
miss
hinkle
simpered
someone
giving
the
name
of
helen
has
just
been
calling
for
your
husband
here
but
we
do
know
anyone
by
the
name
of
helen
lavinia
stopped
and
began
to
look
at
me
through
narrowed
lids
much
as
she
had
done
in
the
library
the
evening
before
and
then
from
different
parts
of
the
room
other
manipulators
began
to
report
every
plagued
one
of
those
five
ouija
boards
was
calling
me
by
name
i
felt
my
ears
grow
crimson
purple
maroon
my
wife
was
looking
at
me
as
though
i
were
some
peculiar
insect
the
squeak
of
ouija
boards
and
the
murmur
of
conversation
rose
louder
and
louder
and
then
i
felt
my
face
twitch
in
the
spasm
of
that
idiotic
grin
i
tried
to
straighten
my
wretched
features
into
their
usual
semblance
of
humanity
i
tried
and
does
he
look
sly
said
miss
hinkle
and
then
i
got
up
and
fled
from
the
room
i
do
not
know
how
that
party
ended
i
do
not
want
to
know
i
went
straight
upstairs
and
undressed
and
crawled
into
bed
and
lay
there
in
the
burning
dark
while
the
last
guest
gurgled
in
the
hall
below
about
the
wonderful
evening
she
had
spent
i
lay
there
while
the
front
door
shut
after
her
and
lavinia
steps
came
up
the
stairs
and
passed
the
door
to
the
guest
room
beyond
and
then
after
a
couple
of
centuries
elapsed
the
clock
struck
three
and
i
dozed
off
to
sleep
at
the
breakfast
table
the
next
morning
there
was
no
sign
of
my
wife
i
concluded
she
was
sleeping
late
but
gladolia
upon
being
questioned
only
shook
her
head
muttered
something
and
turned
the
whites
of
her
eyes
up
to
the
ceiling
i
was
glad
when
the
meal
was
over
and
hurried
to
the
library
for
another
try
at
that
story
i
had
hardly
seated
myself
at
the
desk
when
there
came
a
tap
at
the
door
and
a
white
slip
of
paper
slid
under
it
i
unfolded
it
and
read
dear
john
i
am
going
back
to
my
grandmother
my
lawyer
will
communicate
with
you
later
oh
i
cried
oh
i
wish
i
was
dead
and
that
exactly
what
you
ought
to
be
said
that
horrible
voice
from
the
other
end
of
the
room
i
sat
up
abruptly
i
had
sunk
into
a
chair
under
the
blow
of
the
letter
then
i
dropped
back
again
and
my
hair
rose
in
a
thick
prickle
on
the
top
of
my
head
coming
majestically
across
the
floor
towards
me
was
a
highly
polished
pair
of
thick
laced
shoes
i
stared
at
them
in
a
sort
of
dreadful
fascination
and
then
something
about
their
gait
attracted
my
attention
and
i
recognized
them
see
here
i
said
sternly
what
do
you
mean
by
appearing
here
like
this
ca
help
it
said
the
voice
which
seemed
to
come
from
a
point
about
five
and
a
half
feet
above
the
shoes
i
raised
my
eyes
and
presently
distinguished
her
round
protruding
mouth
why
ca
you
a
nice
way
to
act
to
walk
in
sections
if
you
give
me
time
said
the
mouth
in
an
exasperated
voice
i
assure
you
the
rest
of
me
will
presently
arrive
but
what
the
matter
with
you
you
never
acted
this
way
before
she
seemed
stung
to
make
a
violent
effort
for
a
portion
of
a
fishy
eye
and
the
end
of
her
nose
popped
into
view
with
a
suddenness
that
made
me
jump
it
all
your
fault
she
glared
at
me
while
part
of
her
hair
and
her
plaid
skirt
began
slowly
to
take
form
my
fault
of
course
how
can
you
keep
a
lady
up
working
all
night
and
then
expect
her
to
retain
all
her
faculties
the
next
day
i
just
too
tired
to
materialize
then
why
did
you
bother
because
i
was
sent
to
ask
when
your
wife
is
going
to
get
rid
of
that
ouija
board
how
should
i
know
i
wish
to
heaven
i
never
seen
you
i
cried
look
what
you
done
you
lost
me
my
wife
you
lost
me
my
home
and
happiness
you
you
misto
hallock
came
from
the
hall
outside
misto
hallock
i
gwine
t
quit
i
do
like
no
hoodoos
and
the
steps
retreated
you
you
lost
me
my
cook
i
did
come
here
to
be
abused
said
the
ghost
coldly
i
i
and
then
the
door
opened
and
lavinia
entered
she
wore
the
brown
hat
and
coat
she
usually
travels
in
and
carried
a
suitcase
which
she
set
down
on
the
floor
that
suitcase
had
an
air
of
solid
finality
about
it
and
its
lock
leered
at
me
brassily
i
leaped
from
my
chair
with
unaccustomed
agility
and
sprang
in
front
of
my
wife
i
must
conceal
that
awful
phantom
from
her
at
any
risk
she
did
not
look
at
me
or
thank
heaven
behind
me
but
fixed
her
injured
gaze
upon
the
as
if
to
wrest
dark
secrets
from
it
i
have
come
to
tell
you
that
i
am
leaving
she
staccatoed
oh
yes
yes
i
agreed
flapping
my
arms
about
to
attract
attention
from
the
corner
that
fine
great
so
you
want
me
to
go
do
you
she
demanded
sure
yes
right
away
change
of
air
will
do
you
good
i
join
you
presently
if
only
she
would
go
till
helen
could
i
have
the
devil
of
a
time
explaining
afterward
of
course
but
anything
would
be
better
than
to
have
lavinia
see
a
ghost
why
that
sensitive
little
woman
could
bear
to
have
a
mouse
say
boo
at
her
and
what
would
she
say
to
a
ghost
in
her
own
lavinia
cast
a
cold
eye
upon
me
you
are
acting
very
queerly
she
sniffed
you
are
concealing
something
from
me
just
then
the
door
opened
and
gladolia
called
mis
hallock
hallock
i
come
to
tell
you
done
lef
dis
place
my
wife
turned
her
head
a
moment
but
why
gladolia
i
ai
stayin
round
no
place
wid
dem
ouija
board
contraptions
skeered
of
hoodoos
i
done
gone
i
is
is
that
all
you
got
to
complain
about
lavinia
inquired
yes
all
right
then
go
back
to
the
kitchen
you
can
use
the
board
for
kindling
wood
who
me
touch
dat
no
not
dis
nigger
i
be
the
coon
to
burn
it
i
shouted
i
be
glad
to
burn
it
gladolia
heavy
steps
moved
off
kitchenward
then
my
lavinia
turned
waspishly
to
me
again
john
there
not
a
bit
of
use
trying
to
deceive
me
what
is
it
you
are
trying
to
conceal
from
me
who
me
oh
no
i
lied
elaborately
looking
around
to
see
if
that
dratted
ghost
was
concealed
enough
she
was
so
big
and
i
rather
a
smallish
man
but
that
was
a
bad
move
on
my
part
john
lavinia
demanded
like
a
ward
boss
you
are
hiding
in
here
who
is
it
i
only
waved
denial
and
gurgled
in
my
throat
she
went
on
it
bad
enough
to
have
you
flirt
over
the
ouija
board
with
that
hussy
oh
the
affair
was
quite
i
assure
you
my
love
i
cried
leaping
lithely
about
to
keep
her
from
focusing
her
gaze
behind
me
she
thrust
me
back
with
sudden
muscle
see
who
behind
you
where
is
that
helen
me
i
helen
came
from
the
ghost
lavinia
looked
at
that
apparition
that
phantom
in
plaid
skirt
and
stiff
shirtwaist
with
hair
skewed
back
and
no
powder
on
her
nose
i
threw
a
protecting
husbandly
arm
about
her
to
catch
her
when
she
should
faint
but
she
did
swoon
a
broad
satisfied
smile
spread
over
her
face
i
thought
you
were
helen
of
troy
she
murmured
i
used
to
be
helen
of
troy
new
york
said
the
ghost
and
now
i
be
moving
along
if
you
excuse
me
see
you
later
with
that
she
telescoped
briskly
till
we
saw
only
a
hand
waving
farewell
my
lavinia
fell
forgivingly
into
my
arms
i
kissed
her
once
or
twice
fervently
and
then
i
shoved
her
aside
for
i
felt
a
sudden
strong
desire
to
write
the
sheets
of
paper
on
my
desk
spread
invitingly
before
me
i
got
the
bulliest
plot
for
a
ghost
story
i
cried
the
lady
and
the
ghost
by
rose
cecil
from
the
by
permission
of
john
brisben
walker
and
rose
the
lady
and
the
ghost
by
rose
cecil
it
was
some
moments
before
the
lady
became
rationally
convinced
that
there
was
something
occurring
in
the
corner
of
the
room
and
then
the
actual
nature
of
the
thing
was
still
far
from
clear
to
put
it
as
mildly
as
possible
she
murmured
the
thing
verges
upon
the
uncanny
and
leaning
forward
upon
her
silken
knees
she
attended
upon
the
phenomenon
at
first
it
had
seemed
like
some
faint
and
unexplained
atmospheric
derangement
occasioned
apparently
neither
by
an
opened
window
nor
by
a
door
some
papers
fluttered
to
the
floor
the
fringes
of
the
hangings
softly
waved
and
indeed
it
would
still
have
been
easy
to
dismiss
the
matter
as
the
effect
of
a
vagrant
draft
had
not
the
state
of
things
suddenly
grown
unmistakably
unusual
all
the
air
of
the
room
it
then
appeared
rushed
even
with
violence
to
the
point
and
there
underwent
what
impressed
her
as
an
aerial
convulsion
in
the
very
midst
and
of
which
so
great
was
the
confusion
there
seemed
to
appear
at
intervals
almost
the
semblance
of
a
shape
the
silence
of
the
room
was
disturbed
by
a
book
that
flew
open
with
fluttering
leaves
the
noise
of
a
vase
of
violets
blown
over
from
which
the
perfumed
water
dripped
to
the
floor
and
soft
touchings
all
around
as
of
a
breeze
passing
through
a
chamber
full
of
trifles
the
ringlets
of
the
lady
hair
were
swept
forward
toward
the
corner
upon
which
her
gaze
was
fixed
and
in
which
the
conditions
had
now
grown
so
tense
with
imminent
occurrence
and
so
rent
with
some
inconceivable
throe
that
she
involuntarily
rose
and
stepping
forward
against
the
pressure
of
her
petticoats
which
were
blown
about
her
ankles
she
impatiently
thrust
her
hand
into
the
she
was
immediately
aware
that
another
hand
had
received
it
though
with
a
far
from
substantial
envelopment
and
for
another
moment
what
she
saw
before
her
trembled
between
something
and
nothing
then
from
the
precarious
situation
there
slowly
emerged
into
dubious
view
the
shape
of
a
young
man
dressed
in
evening
clothes
over
which
was
flung
a
mantle
of
voluminous
folds
such
as
is
worn
by
ghosts
of
fashion
the
very
deuce
was
in
it
he
complained
i
thought
i
should
never
materialize
she
flung
herself
into
her
chair
confounded
yet
even
in
the
shock
of
the
emergency
true
to
herself
she
did
not
fail
to
smooth
her
ruffled
locks
her
visitor
had
been
scanning
his
person
in
a
dissatisfied
way
and
with
some
vexation
he
now
ejaculated
beg
your
pardon
my
dear
but
are
my
feet
on
the
floor
or
where
in
thunder
are
they
it
was
with
a
tone
of
reassurance
that
she
confessed
that
his
were
the
trivial
matter
of
two
or
three
inches
from
the
rug
whereupon
with
still
another
effort
he
brought
himself
down
until
his
feet
rested
decently
upon
the
floor
it
was
only
when
he
walked
about
to
examine
the
that
a
suspicious
lightness
was
discernible
in
his
tread
when
he
had
composed
himself
by
the
survey
effecting
it
with
an
air
of
great
insouciance
which
however
failed
to
conceal
the
fact
that
his
heart
was
beating
somewhat
wildly
he
approached
the
lady
well
here
we
are
again
my
love
he
cried
and
devoured
her
hands
with
ghostly
kisses
it
seems
an
eternity
that
i
been
struggling
back
to
you
through
the
outer
void
and
sometimes
i
confess
i
all
but
despaired
life
is
not
i
assure
you
all
beer
and
skittles
for
the
disembodied
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
his
gaze
upon
her
and
the
entire
chamber
seemed
to
envelop
all
and
cherish
it
little
room
little
room
and
so
you
are
thus
do
you
know
he
continued
with
vivacity
i
have
wondered
about
it
in
the
grave
and
i
could
hardly
sleep
for
this
place
unpenetrated
heigho
what
a
lot
of
things
we
leave
undone
i
dashed
this
off
at
the
time
the
literary
passion
strong
in
me
thus
now
when
all
is
done
and
i
lie
so
low
i
can
not
sleep
for
this
my
only
care
for
though
of
that
dim
place
i
could
not
know
that
where
my
heart
was
fain
i
did
not
go
nor
saw
you
musing
there
well
well
these
things
irk
a
ghost
so
naturally
as
soon
as
possible
i
made
my
way
back
to
be
satisfied
to
be
satisfied
that
you
were
still
mine
he
bent
a
piercing
look
upon
her
i
observe
by
the
calendar
on
your
that
some
years
have
elapsed
since
my
um
since
i
expired
he
added
with
a
faint
blush
it
appears
that
the
matter
of
their
dissolution
is
in
conversation
rather
kept
in
the
background
by
ghosts
heigho
how
time
does
fly
you
be
joining
me
soon
my
dear
she
drew
herself
splendidly
up
and
he
was
aware
of
her
beauty
in
the
full
of
its
tenacious
excellence
of
the
delicate
insolence
of
life
looking
upon
death
of
the
fact
she
had
forgotten
he
rose
and
confronted
this
his
trembling
hands
thrust
into
his
pockets
then
turned
away
to
hide
the
dismay
of
his
countenance
he
was
however
a
spook
of
considerable
spirit
and
in
a
jiffy
he
met
the
occasion
to
her
blank
indignant
gaze
he
drew
a
card
from
his
case
and
taking
a
pencil
from
the
secretary
wrote
beneath
the
name
quiet
to
the
breast
it
be
that
gave
an
hour
rest
to
the
heart
of
me
quiet
to
the
breast
till
it
lieth
dead
and
the
heart
be
clay
where
i
visited
quiet
to
the
breast
though
forgetting
quite
the
guest
it
sheltered
once
to
the
heart
good
night
handing
her
the
card
he
bowed
and
through
force
of
habit
turned
to
the
door
forgetting
that
his
ghostly
pressure
would
not
turn
the
knob
as
the
door
did
not
open
with
a
sigh
of
recollection
for
his
spiritual
condition
he
prepared
to
disappear
casting
one
last
look
at
the
faithless
lady
she
was
still
looking
at
the
card
in
her
hand
and
the
tears
ran
down
her
face
she
has
remembered
he
reflected
how
courteous
for
a
moment
it
seemed
he
could
contain
his
disappointment
discreetly
removing
himself
now
at
what
he
felt
was
the
with
the
customary
reticence
of
the
dead
but
feeling
overcame
him
in
an
instant
he
had
her
in
his
arms
and
was
pouring
out
his
love
his
reproaches
the
story
of
his
longing
his
doubts
his
discontent
and
his
desperate
journey
back
to
earth
for
a
sight
of
her
and
ah
cried
he
picture
my
agony
at
finding
that
you
had
forgotten
and
yet
i
surmised
it
in
the
gloom
i
divined
it
by
my
restlessness
and
my
despair
perhaps
some
lines
that
occurred
to
me
will
suggest
the
thing
to
you
you
recall
my
old
knack
for
versification
where
the
grasses
weep
his
darkling
bed
and
the
creep
lies
the
weary
head
of
one
laid
deep
who
can
not
sleep
the
unremembered
dead
he
took
a
chair
beside
her
and
spoke
of
their
old
love
for
each
other
of
his
fealty
through
all
transmutations
incidentally
of
her
beauty
of
her
cruelty
of
the
light
of
her
face
which
had
illumined
his
darksome
way
to
her
and
of
a
lot
of
other
things
and
the
lady
bowed
her
head
and
wept
the
hours
of
the
night
passed
thus
the
moon
waned
and
a
pallor
began
to
tinge
the
dusky
cheek
of
the
east
but
the
eloquence
of
the
visitor
still
flowed
on
and
the
lady
had
his
misty
hands
clasped
to
her
reawakened
bosom
at
last
a
suspicion
of
rosiness
touched
the
curtain
he
abruptly
rose
i
can
not
hold
out
against
the
morning
he
said
it
is
time
all
good
ghosts
were
in
bed
but
she
threw
herself
on
her
knees
before
him
clasping
his
ethereal
waist
with
a
despairing
embrace
oh
do
not
leave
me
she
cried
or
my
love
will
kill
me
he
bent
eagerly
above
her
say
it
again
convince
me
i
love
you
she
cried
again
and
again
and
again
with
such
an
anguish
of
sincerity
as
would
convince
the
most
skeptical
spook
that
ever
revisited
the
glimpses
of
the
moon
you
will
forget
again
he
said
i
shall
never
forget
she
cried
my
life
will
henceforth
be
one
continual
remembrance
of
you
one
long
act
of
devotion
to
your
memory
one
oblation
one
unceasing
penitence
one
agony
of
waiting
he
lifted
her
face
and
saw
that
it
was
true
well
said
he
gracefully
wrapping
his
cloak
about
him
well
now
i
shall
have
a
little
peace
he
kissed
her
with
a
certain
jaunty
grace
upon
her
hair
and
prepared
to
dissolve
while
he
lightly
tapped
a
tattoo
upon
his
leg
with
the
gloves
he
carried
my
dear
he
said
henceforth
i
shall
sleep
o
nights
my
heart
is
quite
at
rest
but
mine
is
breaking
she
wailed
madly
trying
once
more
to
clasp
his
vanishing
form
he
threw
her
a
kiss
from
his
misty
and
all
that
remained
with
her
besides
her
broken
heart
was
a
faint
disturbance

the
