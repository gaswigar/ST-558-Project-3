i
a
dream
of
youth
i
was
seventeen
years
old
her
name
was
urania
was
urania
a
fair
maiden
a
dream
of
spring
an
innocent
but
inquisitive
daughter
of
eve
no
she
was
simply
as
in
days
of
yore
that
one
of
the
nine
muses
who
presided
over
astronomy
and
whose
celestial
glance
inspired
and
directed
the
chorus
of
the
spheres
she
was
the
angelic
idea
which
soars
above
terrestrial
dulness
she
had
not
the
disturbing
flesh
nor
the
heart
whose
palpitations
are
communicated
at
a
distance
nor
the
gentle
ardor
of
human
life
but
she
existed
nevertheless
in
a
sort
of
ideal
world
lofty
and
always
pure
and
yet
she
was
human
enough
in
name
and
form
to
produce
a
strong
and
deep
impression
upon
an
adolescent
soul
to
arouse
in
that
soul
an
indefinite
indefinable
feeling
of
admiration
almost
of
love
in
his
hours
of
solitude
and
even
through
the
intellectual
labors
with
which
the
education
of
the
day
overloads
his
brain
a
young
man
whose
hand
has
never
plucked
the
divine
fruit
from
the
tree
of
paradise
whose
lips
are
still
untouched
whose
heart
has
not
yet
spoken
whose
senses
are
beginning
to
awaken
amid
vague
new
aspirations
thrills
with
a
presentiment
of
the
divinity
to
which
he
is
soon
to
sacrifice
and
personifies
beforehand
in
forms
the
unknown
being
who
floats
through
the
airy
fabric
of
his
dreams
he
wishes
longs
to
reach
this
unknown
being
but
dares
not
yet
perhaps
may
never
dare
in
the
purity
of
his
admiration
unless
some
helping
hand
come
to
his
aid
if
chloe
is
not
well
informed
indiscreet
and
talkative
lycinion
must
take
it
upon
herself
to
instruct
daphnis
whatever
tells
us
of
the
yet
unknown
attraction
can
charm
interest
delight
and
captivate
us
a
cold
engraving
showing
the
oval
of
a
pure
face
even
an
painting
a
sculpture
a
sculpture
especially
awakens
a
new
feeling
in
our
hearts
the
blood
flows
faster
or
seems
to
stop
the
idea
crosses
our
reddening
brow
like
a
flash
and
remains
floating
in
our
pensive
mind
it
is
the
beginning
of
desires
the
beginning
of
life
the
dawn
of
a
beautiful
summer
day
harbinger
of
the
sunrise
as
for
me
my
first
love
my
adolescent
passion
had
not
for
its
object
assuredly
but
as
a
determining
cause
a
clock
it
is
rather
odd
but
so
it
is
humdrum
calculations
used
up
all
my
afternoons
from
two
until
four
it
was
merely
correcting
observations
made
the
night
before
of
stars
or
planets
by
applying
the
reductions
arising
from
atmospheric
refraction
which
itself
depends
on
the
height
of
the
barometer
and
the
temperature
these
calculations
are
as
simple
as
they
are
tiresome
they
are
made
mechanically
by
the
help
of
prepared
tables
while
thinking
of
something
else
the
illustrious
le
verrier
was
then
director
of
the
paris
observatory
although
in
no
way
artistic
he
had
in
his
study
a
golden
bronze
clock
of
very
beautiful
design
dating
from
the
end
of
the
first
empire
the
work
of
pradier
chisel
the
pedestal
of
this
clock
represented
in
the
birth
of
astronomy
on
the
egyptian
plains
a
massive
celestial
sphere
surrounded
by
the
zodiacal
circle
supported
by
sphinxes
held
the
dial
egyptian
gods
adorned
the
sides
but
the
chief
beauty
of
this
artistic
work
consisted
of
an
exquisite
little
statue
of
urania
lithe
elegant
i
had
almost
said
majestic
illustration
the
celestial
muse
was
standing
with
her
right
hand
she
measured
the
degrees
of
the
starry
sphere
by
the
aid
of
a
compass
her
drooping
left
hand
held
a
small
astronomical
telescope
superbly
draped
she
looked
down
in
an
attitude
of
stately
grandeur
i
had
never
before
seen
so
beautiful
a
face
as
hers
with
the
light
falling
directly
upon
it
the
pure
countenance
looked
grave
and
austere
if
the
light
came
to
it
obliquely
it
appeared
somewhat
meditative
but
coming
from
above
and
from
the
side
the
enchanting
face
brightened
with
a
mysterious
smile
her
glance
grew
almost
caressing
her
exquisite
serenity
gave
place
to
an
expression
of
joy
amiability
and
happiness
delightful
to
contemplate
it
was
like
a
song
of
the
soul
a
poetic
melody
these
changes
of
expression
fairly
made
the
statue
alive
muse
and
goddess
she
was
beautiful
she
was
enchanting
she
was
adorable
illustration
whenever
i
had
occasion
to
go
to
the
eminent
mathematician
it
was
not
his
reputation
which
impressed
me
most
i
forgot
the
formulas
of
logarithms
and
even
the
immortal
discovery
of
the
planet
neptune
to
bow
beneath
the
charm
of
pradier
work
the
beautiful
figure
so
admirably
modelled
beneath
its
antique
drapery
the
graceful
throat
the
expressive
face
attracted
my
eyes
and
captivated
my
thoughts
very
often
as
we
were
leaving
the
office
about
four
to
go
back
to
paris
i
would
peep
through
the
door
to
see
if
the
director
were
absent
monday
and
wednesday
were
the
best
days
the
first
because
of
the
institute
meetings
which
he
seldom
missed
the
second
on
account
of
the
bureau
of
longitudes
sessions
which
he
avoided
with
the
most
profound
disdain
he
would
even
leave
the
observatory
expressly
to
make
his
contempt
for
them
more
emphatic
then
i
would
stand
before
my
dear
urania
and
look
at
her
to
my
heart
content
enraptured
by
her
beauty
of
form
and
face
and
go
away
more
satisfied
but
not
happier
she
charmed
but
filled
me
with
regrets
one
evening
the
evening
on
which
i
discovered
how
the
light
could
change
her
face
i
found
the
wide
open
a
lamp
stood
on
the
shedding
its
rays
over
the
muse
in
one
of
her
most
bewitching
aspects
the
slanting
light
lovingly
caressed
the
brow
cheeks
lips
and
throat
her
expression
was
wonderful
i
went
in
and
for
a
while
stood
there
in
motionless
contemplation
then
i
tried
changing
the
position
of
the
lamp
making
the
light
play
over
the
shoulders
arms
neck
and
hair
the
statue
seemed
to
live
to
think
to
awake
and
smile
again
odd
whimsical
idea
strange
feeling
i
had
actually
fallen
in
love
i
had
changed
from
admirer
to
lover
if
i
had
been
told
then
that
what
i
felt
was
not
real
love
and
that
this
platonism
was
but
a
childish
dream
i
should
have
been
very
incredulous
the
director
came
in
but
did
not
seem
so
much
surprised
at
my
presence
as
i
might
have
feared
the
study
was
often
used
to
reach
the
observation
rooms
you
are
late
for
jupiter
he
said
as
i
replaced
the
lamp
on
the
and
when
i
reached
the
threshold
he
added
can
it
be
possible
that
you
are
a
poet
lengthening
out
the
last
syllable
as
though
he
had
said
poÃ«t
i
might
have
answered
him
by
quoting
kepler
galileo
the
two
herschels
and
other
famous
savants
who
were
poets
and
astronomers
at
the
same
time
i
could
have
reminded
him
that
the
first
director
of
this
very
observatory
cassini
sang
of
urania
in
latin
french
and
italian
verse
but
the
observatory
pupils
were
not
in
the
habit
of
answering
the
in
any
way
whatever
senators
were
personages
of
importance
in
those
days
and
the
directorship
of
the
observatory
was
a
then
too
the
great
geometrician
would
have
looked
upon
the
most
wonderful
poem
by
dante
ariosto
or
hugo
with
the
same
profound
disdain
that
a
big
newfoundland
dog
would
show
if
one
should
put
a
glass
of
wine
to
his
mouth
besides
i
was
clearly
in
the
wrong
how
that
charming
figure
of
urania
haunted
me
with
all
the
delicious
changes
of
expression
her
smile
was
so
gracious
and
sometimes
her
bronze
eyes
had
such
a
real
look
she
lacked
nothing
but
speech
that
night
just
as
i
fell
asleep
i
saw
the
divine
goddess
again
and
this
time
she
spoke
oh
she
was
really
living
now
and
what
a
pretty
mouth
i
could
have
kissed
each
word
come
she
said
come
up
into
the
sky
far
away
from
the
earth
you
shall
look
down
upon
this
lower
world
you
shall
contemplate
the
great
universe
in
its
grandeur
come
and
see

illustration
ii
unknown
humanities
then
i
saw
the
earth
sinking
down
into
the
yawning
depths
of
immensity
the
cupolas
of
the
observatory
paris
with
its
lights
were
rapidly
fading
away
although
feeling
as
if
i
were
motionless
i
had
the
same
sensation
which
one
experiences
on
rising
in
a
balloon
and
seeing
the
earth
descend
i
went
up
up
in
a
magic
flight
toward
the
inaccessible
zenith
urania
was
with
me
a
little
higher
up
looking
at
me
kindly
and
pointing
out
the
kingdoms
below
day
had
come
again
i
recognized
france
the
rhine
germany
austria
italy
the
mediterranean
spain
the
atlantic
ocean
the
channel
england
but
all
this
liliputian
geography
soon
shrank
away
speedily
the
terrestrial
globe
was
reduced
to
the
dimensions
of
the
moon
in
its
last
quarter
then
to
a
little
full
moon
there
said
she
is
the
famous
terrestrial
globe
on
which
so
many
passions
stir
within
whose
narrow
limits
the
thought
of
so
many
millions
of
human
beings
is
confined
whose
sight
can
not
extend
beyond
it
see
how
its
apparent
size
diminishes
as
our
horizon
develops
we
can
no
longer
distinguish
europe
from
asia
and
there
is
north
america
how
very
small
it
all
is
as
we
passed
through
the
moon
neighborhood
i
had
noticed
our
satellite
hilly
landscapes
the
mountain
crests
radiant
with
light
deep
valleys
filled
with
shadows
and
i
should
have
liked
to
stop
for
a
nearer
study
of
the
surroundings
but
urania
did
not
deign
to
bestow
so
much
as
a
passing
glance
at
it
and
drew
me
on
in
a
rapid
flight
toward
the
sidereal
regions
we
were
still
ascending
the
earth
grew
smaller
and
smaller
as
we
receded
from
it
until
it
looked
like
a
simple
star
shining
from
solar
illumination
on
the
bosom
of
dark
and
empty
space
we
turned
toward
the
sun
which
shone
in
space
but
without
filling
it
with
light
so
that
we
could
see
stars
and
planets
at
the
same
time
no
longer
obscured
by
its
rays
because
it
could
not
illumine
empty
space
the
angelic
goddess
showed
me
mercury
in
close
neighborhood
to
the
sun
venus
shining
on
the
other
side
the
earth
equalling
venus
in
appearance
and
brilliancy
mars
whose
inland
seas
and
canals
i
recognized
jupiter
with
its
four
enormous
moons
saturn
uranus
all
these
worlds
said
she
are
upheld
in
vacancy
by
the
attraction
of
the
sun
around
which
they
revolve
with
great
speed
it
is
an
harmonious
choir
gravitating
about
its
centre
the
earth
is
but
a
floating
island
a
little
hamlet
of
this
great
solar
country
and
the
solar
empire
itself
is
but
a
little
province
on
the
breast
of
sidereal
vastness
we
rose
still
higher
the
sun
and
its
system
were
rapidly
passing
the
earth
was
but
a
little
spot
now
jupiter
himself
that
colossal
world
had
melted
away
like
mars
and
venus
to
a
tiny
little
dot
scarcely
larger
than
the
earth
we
passed
within
sight
of
saturn
surrounded
by
his
gigantic
rings
whose
study
alone
would
be
sufficient
to
prove
the
immense
and
unimaginable
variety
reigning
in
the
universe
saturn
is
a
whole
system
in
itself
with
its
rings
composed
of
particles
torn
from
it
in
its
dizzy
revolution
and
with
its
eight
satellites
accompanying
it
like
a
celestial
retinue
illustration
as
we
soared
aloft
our
sun
decreased
in
grandeur
soon
it
had
descended
to
the
rank
of
a
planet
then
lost
all
majesty
all
superiority
over
the
sidereal
population
and
was
nothing
more
than
a
star
scarcely
more
brilliant
than
the
others
i
looked
about
me
at
all
this
vast
extent
on
whose
spangled
bosom
we
were
still
going
upward
and
tried
to
recognize
the
constellations
but
their
forms
were
beginning
to
change
perceptibly
from
the
lengthening
perspective
caused
by
my
journey
i
thought
i
could
see
that
our
sun
had
insensibly
dwindled
to
a
tiny
star
and
joined
the
constellation
of
the
centaur
while
a
new
light
pale
bluish
and
very
strange
seemed
to
greet
me
from
the
direction
toward
which
urania
was
bearing
me
this
new
brightness
had
nothing
terrestrial
about
it
and
reminded
me
of
no
effect
that
i
had
ever
seen
on
the
earth
among
the
changing
tints
of
the
sunset
after
a
storm
or
in
the
undefined
mists
of
morning
or
during
the
calm
and
silent
moonlight
hours
on
the
mirror
of
the
sea
this
last
effect
is
nearer
its
appearance
but
the
strange
light
was
and
became
more
and
more
of
a
real
blue
blue
not
like
a
reflection
of
celestial
azure
nor
like
a
contrast
analogous
to
that
produced
by
an
electric
light
compared
with
gas
but
blue
as
if
the
sun
itself
were
blue
illustration
imagine
my
amazement
when
i
discovered
that
we
were
approaching
the
influence
of
an
absolutely
blue
sun
like
a
shining
disk
which
might
have
been
cut
from
one
of
our
most
beautiful
terrestrial
skies
standing
out
luminously
upon
a
perfectly
black
background
all
thickly
studded
with
stars
this
sapphire
sun
was
the
centre
of
a
planetary
system
lighted
by
its
rays
we
were
to
pass
quite
near
one
of
the
planets
the
blue
sun
increased
perceptibly
in
size
but
another
phenomenon
as
singular
as
the
first
the
light
it
threw
upon
this
planet
seemed
to
be
tinged
on
one
side
with
green
i
looked
into
the
sky
again
and
saw
a
second
sun
this
one
a
beautiful
emerald
green
i
could
not
believe
my
eyes
urania
said
we
are
crossing
the
solar
system
of
gamma
andromedÃ¦
of
which
you
see
but
one
part
as
yet
for
it
is
made
up
not
of
these
two
suns
but
in
reality
of
three
one
blue
one
green
and
one
orange
yellow
the
blue
sun
which
is
the
smallest
turns
around
the
green
sun
and
the
latter
gravitates
with
its
companion
around
the
great
orange
sun
which
you
will
perceive
in
an
instant
sure
enough
a
second
later
i
saw
a
third
sun
colored
with
a
glowing
radiancy
whose
contrast
with
its
two
companions
produced
a
most
dazzling
illumination
i
knew
about
this
interesting
sidereal
system
from
having
observed
it
more
than
once
through
the
telescope
but
i
had
never
suspected
its
real
splendor
what
fiery
depths
what
scintillations
what
brilliancy
of
color
in
that
strange
source
of
blue
light
in
the
second
sun
green
illumination
and
the
tawny
golden
effulgence
of
the
third
illustration
but
as
i
have
said
we
were
approaching
one
of
the
worlds
belonging
to
the
system
of
the
sapphire
sun
everything
was
blue
landscapes
water
plants
rocks
slightly
greenish
on
the
side
lighted
by
the
second
sun
and
hardly
touched
by
the
rays
of
the
orange
sun
which
was
rising
on
the
distant
horizon
as
we
floated
into
the
atmosphere
of
this
world
a
soft
delicious
music
was
wafted
into
the
air
like
a
perfume
a
dream
never
had
i
heard
anything
like
it
the
sweet
deep
distant
melody
seemed
to
come
from
a
choir
of
harps
and
violins
strengthened
by
an
accompaniment
of
organs
it
was
an
exquisite
anthem
which
charmed
at
once
it
needed
no
analyzing
to
be
understood
it
filled
the
soul
with
ecstasy
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
could
have
lingered
there
listening
for
an
eternity
i
was
so
fearful
of
losing
a
single
note
that
i
dared
not
speak
to
my
guide
urania
noticed
it
stretching
out
her
hand
toward
a
lake
she
pointed
to
a
group
of
winged
beings
who
were
hovering
over
the
blue
waters
they
had
not
the
earthly
human
form
they
were
beings
who
had
evidently
been
created
to
live
in
air
they
seemed
woven
out
of
light
at
a
distance
i
thought
they
were
they
had
their
slender
graceful
shape
the
same
wide
wings
quickness
and
lightness
but
on
examining
them
more
closely
i
noticed
their
height
which
was
not
inferior
to
our
own
and
realized
from
the
expression
of
their
eyes
that
they
were
not
animals
their
heads
were
very
like
that
of
the
and
like
those
aerial
creatures
they
had
no
legs
the
delicious
music
to
which
i
had
been
listening
was
but
the
noise
of
their
flight
they
were
very
numerous
perhaps
many
thousands
from
the
could
be
seen
plants
which
were
neither
trees
nor
flowers
whose
slender
stalks
rose
to
an
enormous
height
the
branched
stems
bearing
as
though
with
outstretched
arms
great
cups
these
plants
were
alive
or
as
much
so
as
our
sensitive
growths
perhaps
more
and
like
the
with
its
moving
leaves
showed
their
internal
impressions
by
their
motions
these
groves
formed
actual
vegetable
cities
the
inhabitants
of
this
world
had
no
other
dwellings
but
reposed
among
the
fragrant
when
not
floating
in
the
air
illustration
this
seems
a
very
strange
world
to
you
said
urania
you
are
wondering
what
kinds
of
ideas
habits
or
history
these
people
could
have
what
kinds
of
arts
literature
and
sciences
it
would
take
a
long
time
to
answer
all
the
questions
you
might
ask
know
only
that
their
eyes
are
superior
to
your
finest
telescopes
that
their
nervous
system
vibrates
at
the
passing
of
a
comet
and
discovers
by
an
electric
sense
facts
which
you
on
the
earth
will
never
know
the
organs
which
you
see
under
their
wings
serve
as
hands
more
skilful
than
yours
instead
of
printing
they
take
the
direct
photography
of
events
and
the
phonetic
impression
of
words
they
care
very
little
for
anything
but
scientific
research
that
is
to
say
the
study
of
nature
the
three
passions
which
absorb
the
greater
part
of
earthly
life
eager
greed
for
fortune
political
ambition
and
love
are
unknown
to
them
because
they
require
nothing
to
live
on
there
are
no
international
divisions
nor
government
except
a
council
of
administration
and
because
they
are
androgynous
androgynous
i
repeated
and
ventured
to
add
is
that
best
it
is
it
is
a
great
deal
of
trouble
saved
to
a
humanity
to
be
in
a
condition
to
understand
the
infinite
diversity
displayed
in
the
different
phases
of
creation
she
continued
it
is
necessary
to
cast
aside
all
terrestrial
feelings
and
ideas
just
as
the
species
of
your
planet
have
changed
in
succeeding
ages
from
the
uncouth
creatures
of
the
first
geological
periods
to
the
appearance
of
man
and
as
even
now
the
animal
and
vegetable
population
of
the
earth
is
still
composed
of
the
most
widely
varying
forms
from
man
to
the
coral
from
bird
to
fish
from
an
elephant
to
a
butterfly
so
on
an
incomparably
vaster
scale
the
forces
of
nature
have
given
birth
to
an
infinite
diversity
of
beings
and
things
throughout
the
innumerable
worlds
of
heaven
the
form
of
its
occupant
is
the
result
in
each
world
of
some
element
peculiar
to
that
globe

light
electricity

functions
the
number
of
the
senses
you
have
but
five

they
are
rather
poor

on
the
vital
conditions
of
each

to
express
it
better
more
strictly
speaking

by
each

according
to
its
organic
condition
and
following
a
primordial
law
which
all
nature
obeys
the
law
of
progress
illustration
while
she
was
speaking
i
had
watched
the
flight
of
the
aerial
creatures
toward
the
city
of
flowers
and
saw
with
astonishment
that
the
plants
were
moving
raising
or
lowering
themselves
to
receive
them
the
green
sun
had
sunk
beneath
the
horizon
and
the
yellow
sun
had
risen
in
the
sky
the
landscape
was
suffused
with
a
tinge
over
which
hung
an
enormous
moon
then
the
infinite
melody
which
had
been
filling
the
air
died
away
and
amid
a
profound
silence
i
heard
a
song
arise
from
so
pure
a
voice
that
no
human
tones
could
be
compared
with
it
what
a
marvellous
system
i
cried

illumined
by
such
glowing
lights

she
answered
gracefully
united
in
the
bonds
of
a
mutual
attraction
from
the

you
see
them
cradled
two
and
two
on
the
bosom
of
the
sky
always
beautiful
pure
and
luminous
hanging
in
the
infinite
they
lean
to
each
other
but
never
touch
as
though
their
union
more
moral
than
material
were
ordered
by
an
invisible
and
superior
power
and
following
harmonious
curves
they
gravitate
in
cadence
around
each
other
celestial
couples
which
blossomed
at
the
of
creation
in
the
constellated
meadows
of
infinity
while
simple
suns

yours
shine
in
the
deserts

even

that

the
infinite
variety
of
beings
the
tricolored
system
had
long
since
disappeared
in
our
upward
flight
we
were
passing
through
the
neighborhood
of
a
great
many
worlds
which
were
very
different
from
our
earth
some
of
them
appeared
to
be
entirely
covered
with
water
and
peopled
by
aquatic
beings
others
occupied
entirely
by
plants
we
stopped
near
several
of
them
what
unimaginable
variety
the
inhabitants
of
one
of
them
seemed
to
me
especially
beautiful
urania
apprised
me
of
the
fact
that
their
organization
was
totally
different
from
that
of
the
children
of
earth
and
that
those
human
beings
could
discern
the
operations
which
take
place
in
the
maintenance
of
the
body
in
our
earthly
organism
we
do
not
see
for
example
how
the
food
absorbed
is
assimilated
how
the
blood
tissues
and
bones
renew
themselves
all
functions
are
fulfilled
instinctively
without
thought
perceiving
it
thus
man
suffers
from
a
thousand
maladies
whose
origin
is
hidden
and
often
undiscoverable
there
the
human
being
feels
the
action
of
his
vital
nourishment
as
we
feel
pleasure
or
pain
a
nerve
starts
from
every
particle
of
his
body
so
to
speak
which
transmits
the
different
impressions
it
receives
to
the
brain
if
terrestrial
man
were
endowed
with
such
a
nervous
system
looking
into
his
organism
through
the
intermediary
of
the
nerves
he
would
see
how
food
transforms
itself
into
chyle
the
latter
into
blood
blood
into
flesh
muscular
nervous
substance
etc
he
would
see
himself
but
we
are
very
far
from
that
the
centre
of
our
perceptions
being
obstructed
by
nerves
thickened
by
cerebral
lobes
and
optic
thalami
on
another
globe
which
we
crossed
during
the
night
that
is
to
say
on
the
side
of
its
nocturnal
hemisphere
human
eyes
are
so
constructed
as
to
be
and
shine
as
though
some
phosphorescent
emanation
radiated
from
their
strange
centres
a
night
meeting
comprising
a
large
number
of
these
persons
presents
an
extremely
fantastic
appearance
because
the
brilliancy
as
well
as
the
color
of
the
eyes
changes
with
the
different
passions
by
which
they
are
swayed
more
than
that
the
power
of
their
glance
is
such
that
they
exert
an
and
magnetic
influence
of
variable
intensity
and
which
under
certain
conditions
has
the
effect
of
lightning
causing
the
victim
upon
whom
the
force
and
energy
of
their
will
is
fixed
to
fall
dead
a
little
farther
away
my
celestial
guide
pointed
out
a
world
in
which
organisms
enjoy
a
precious
faculty
the
soul
may
change
its
body
without
passing
through
the
often
disagreeable
and
always
sad
experience
of
death
a
savant
who
has
labored
all
his
life
for
the
instruction
of
mankind
and
feels
that
his
end
is
drawing
near
before
he
has
been
able
to
complete
his
noble
undertaking
can
change
bodies
with
a
youth
and
begin
a
new
life
still
more
useful
than
the
first
the
young
consent
and
the
magnetic
manipulation
of
a
competent
physician
are
sufficient
for
the
transmigration
sometimes
it
happens
that
two
persons
united
by
the
sweet
strong
ties
of
love
effect
such
an
exchange
of
bodies
after
a
union
of
many
years
the
husband
soul
takes
the
body
and
conversely
for
the
rest
of
their
existence
the
inmost
experience
of
life
becomes
incomparably
more
complete
for
each
of
them
savants
and
historians
desirous
of
living
two
centuries
instead
of
one
are
seen
to
fall
into
a
long
artificial
winter
sleep
which
suspends
their
lives
for
half
of
each
year
and
even
more
some
even
succeed
in
living
three
times
longer
than
the
normal
life
of
centenarians
a
few
seconds
later
crossing
another
system
we
met
a
kind
of
organism
still
more
different
from
ours
and
assuredly
far
superior
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
planet
we
were
then
looking
at
a
world
lighted
by
a
brilliant
hydrogenized
sun
thought
is
not
obliged
to
pass
through
speech
to
be
understood
how
many
times
has
it
not
happened
when
a
bright
or
transcendent
idea
came
into
our
minds
and
we
wanted
to
utter
it
or
write
it
out
that
just
as
we
were
about
to
speak
or
write
we
felt
that
it
was
slipping
away
flying
from
us
confused
or
metamorphosed
into
something
else
the
inhabitants
of
this
planet
have
a
sixth
sense
which
might
be
called
by
virtue
of
which
when
the
author
is
not
disinclined
the
thought
becomes
outwardly
manifest
and
can
be
read
upon
a
feature
which
occupies
very
much
the
same
place
as
a
forehead
these
silent
conversations
are
often
the
deepest
and
most
enjoyable
always
the
most
sincere
we
are
innocently
disposed
to
believe
that
the
human
organism
is
perfect
and
leaves
nothing
on
earth
to
be
desired
but
for
all
that
have
we
not
often
regretted
being
obliged
to
listen
in
spite
of
ourselves
to
disagreeable
words
absurd
speeches
a
sermon
verbose
with
emptiness
bad
music
slander
or
calumny
our
grammars
vainly
pretend
that
we
can
close
our
ears
to
these
speeches
unfortunately
there
is
no
such
thing
you
can
not
shut
your
ears
as
you
can
your
eyes
i
was
very
much
surprised
to
find
a
planet
where
nature
had
not
forgotten
this
salutary
provision
as
we
stopped
there
for
an
instant
urania
pointed
out
ears
which
closed
like
eyelids
there
is
very
much
less
anger
and
vexation
here
than
with
you
said
she
but
the
wranglings
of
political
parties
are
much
more
sharp
and
vociferous
adversaries
are
unwilling
to
listen
to
disputes
and
succeed
effectually
notwithstanding
the
speakers
may
be
most
loquacious
on
another
world
in
which
phosphorus
plays
a
large
part
whose
atmosphere
is
constantly
electrified
whose
temperature
is
very
high
and
where
the
inhabitants
have
no
sufficient
reason
for
inventing
wearing
apparel
certain
passions
manifest
themselves
by
the
illumination
of
some
part
of
the
body
it
is
the
same
thing
on
a
large
scale
that
we
see
in
our
terrestrial
meadows
on
a
smaller
one
in
mild
summer
evenings
when
silently
manifest
themselves
and
then
waste
away
in
a
soft
amorous
flame
it
is
very
curious
to
observe
the
appearance
of
these
luminous
couples
in
the
evening
in
populous
cities
the
color
of
the
phosphorescence
differs
in
the
sexes
and
its
intensity
varies
with
the
age
and
temperament
the
stronger
sex
burns
with
a
more
or
less
ardent
red
flame
and
the
gentler
sex
with
a
bluish
light
sometimes
pale
and
diaphanous
our
however
give
but
a
very
faint
and
rudimentary
idea
respecting
the
nature
of
the
impressions
experienced
by
these
peculiar
beings
i
could
not
believe
my
eyes
when
we
were
passing
through
the
atmosphere
of
this
planet
but
i
was
still
more
surprised
on
arriving
at
the
satellite
of
this
unique
world
that
was
a
solitary
moon
lighted
by
a
kind
of
twilight
sun
a
sombre
valley
lay
before
us
from
the
trees
scattered
on
both
slopes
of
the
valley
hung
human
beings
enveloped
in
shrouds
they
had
tied
themselves
to
the
branches
by
their
hair
and
were
sleeping
in
the
deepest
silence
what
i
had
taken
for
was
a
covering
formed
from
the
growth
of
their
bleached
and
tangled
locks
as
i
was
wondering
at
this
marvellous
spectacle
urania
told
me
this
was
their
usual
mode
of
interment
and
resurrection
yes
on
this
world
human
beings
enjoyed
the
organic
faculty
of
those
insects
which
have
the
gift
of
going
to
sleep
in
a
chrysalis
state
and
metamorphosing
themselves
into
winged
butterflies
it
is
like
a
double
human
race
and
the
beings
in
the
first
phase
even
the
coarsest
and
most
material
of
them
need
but
to
die
to
rise
again
in
the
most
splendid
of
transformations
each
year
in
this
world
represents
about
two
hundred
terrestrial
years
two
thirds
of
the
year
is
lived
in
the
lower
condition
one
third
winter
in
the
chrysalis
state
and
the
following
spring
the
sleepers
feel
life
coming
back
to
their
transformed
flesh
they
stir
awaken
leave
their
fleecy
coverings
on
the
trees
and
freeing
themselves
from
them
fly
away
wonderful
winged
creatures
to
aerial
regions
there
to
live
for
a
new
phoenician
year
that
is
for
two
hundred
years
of
our
swiftly
moving
planet
we
crossed
a
great
number
of
planets
in
this
way
and
it
seemed
as
though
all
eternity
would
not
be
long
enough
to
admit
of
my
enjoying
these
creations
unknown
to
earth
but
my
guide
barely
left
me
time
to
realize
this
and
still
new
suns
and
new
worlds
were
appearing
we
were
very
near
striking
against
some
transparent
comets
in
our
rapid
flight
that
were
wandering
about
like
a
breath
from
one
system
to
another
and
more
than
once
i
felt
myself
strongly
attracted
toward
wonderful
planets
with
fresh
landscapes
whose
occupants
would
have
been
new
objects
of
study
and
yet
the
celestial
muse
bore
me
on
without
fatigue
still
higher
still
farther
away
until
at
last
we
came
to
what
seemed
to
me
the
confines
of
the
universe
the
suns
grew
more
rare
less
luminous
paler
darkness
was
more
intense
between
the
stars
and
we
were
soon
in
the
midst
of
an
actual
desert
the
thousands
of
millions
of
stars
which
constitute
the
universe
visible
from
the
earth
being
far
distant
everything
had
faded
to
a
little
lonely
milky
way
in
empty
infinity
at
last
we
have
reached
the
very
limits
of
creation
i
cried
illustration
look
she
replied
pointing
to
the
zenith
illustration
iv
eternity
and
the
infinite
what
was
that
could
it
be
true
another
universe
was
coming
down
to
us
millions
and
millions
of
suns
grouped
together
were
floating
about
like
a
celestial
archipelago
and
as
we
flew
toward
them
they
spread
themselves
out
like
a
limitless
cloud
of
stars
i
looked
about
me
on
all
sides
trying
to
pierce
the
depths
of
boundless
space
and
saw
similar
clusters
of
twinkling
stars
scattered
about
in
all
directions
at
various
distances
the
new
universe
which
we
were
entering
was
made
up
principally
of
red
ruby
and
garnet
suns
many
of
them
were
absolutely
it
was
like
going
through
a
magnificent
display
of
lightning
we
sped
swiftly
from
sun
to
sun
but
incessant
electrical
commotions
like
the
flashes
of
an
assailed
us
on
all
sides
what
strange
worlds
lighted
solely
by
red
suns
must
be
then
too
we
saw
in
one
section
of
this
universe
a
secondary
group
composed
of
great
numbers
of
and
blue
stars
suddenly
an
enormous
comet
whose
head
was
like
some
monster
open
jaws
rushed
upon
and
enveloped
us
i
clung
to
my
goddess
side
who
was
for
a
moment
hidden
from
me
by
a
luminous
haze
we
were
soon
in
a
dark
desert
again
for
the
second
universe
like
the
first
was
now
far
away
creation
she
said
comprises
an
infinite
number
of
distinct
worlds
separated
from
each
other
by
abysses
of
vacancy
an
number
a
mathematical
objection
she
answered
doubtless
no
matter
how
great
a
number
may
be
it
can
not
be
actually
infinite
since
by
thought
one
can
always
increase
by
a
unit
or
even
double
treble
centuple
it
but
remember
that
the
present
is
but
a
door
through
which
the
future
rushes
to
the
past
eternity
is
endless
and
the
number
of
the
worlds
will
be
like
it
without
end
look
you
still
see
always
and
on
all
sides
new
celestial
archipelagoes
new
worlds
everywhere
it
seems
to
me
o
urania
that
we
have
been
ascending
toward
the
boundless
heavens
for
a
long
time
and
at
very
great
speed
we
could
rise
like
this
forever
she
answered
and
never
reach
a
definite
limit
we
could
be
wafted
about
yonder
to
right
to
left
forward
backward
above
below
in
no
matter
what
direction
but
never
anywhere
should
we
find
any
confines
never
never
any
end
do
you
know
where
we
are
do
you
know
how
we
reached
here
we
are
on
the
threshold
of
the
infinite
as
we
were
when
on
the
earth
have
not
advanced
one
step
a
deep
emotion
had
taken
possession
of
my
mind
urania
last
words
had
pierced
my
very
marrow
like
an
icy
chill
never
any
end
never
never
i
repeated
i
could
think
or
speak
of
nothing
else
but
still
the
magnificence
of
the
spectacle
appealed
to
my
eyes
and
my
feeling
of
annihilation
gave
place
to
enthusiasm
astronomy
i
cried
is
everything
to
know
these
things
to
live
in
the
infinite
oh
urania
what
are
other
human
ideas
compared
with
science
shadows
phantoms
oh
you
will
wake
up
again
upon
the
earth
she
said
you
will
admire
and
rightly
too
the
wisdom
of
your
masters
but
understand
this
the
astronomy
of
your
schools
and
observatories
mathematical
astronomy
the
beautiful
science
as
known
to
newton
laplace
le
verrier
is
not
yet
definite
actual
knowledge
that
o
my
son
is
not
the
end
which
i
have
pursued
since
the
days
of
hipparchus
and
ptolemy
look
at
the
thousands
of
suns
analogous
to
that
which
gives
life
to
the
earth
which
like
it
are
sources
of
light
motion
activity
and
splendor
ah
that
is
the
object
of
the
science
to
come
the
study
of
universal
and
eternal
life
until
now
no
one
has
ever
entered
the
temple
figures
are
not
an
end
but
a
means
they
do
not
represent
nature
structure
only
the
methods
the
scaffoldings
you
are
to
see
the
dawn
of
a
new
day
mathematical
astronomy
will
yield
her
place
to
physical
astronomy
to
the
true
study
of
nature
yes
she
continued
astronomers
who
calculate
the
movements
of
the
stars
in
their
daily
passage
of
the
meridian
those
who
foretell
eclipses
celestial
phenomena
periodical
comets
who
observe
the
exact
positions
of
the
stars
and
planets
on
the
different
degrees
of
the
celestial
sphere
so
carefully
those
who
discover
comets
planets
satellites
and
variable
stars
those
who
investigate
and
determine
the
disturbance
caused
the
earth
motion
by
attraction
from
the
moon
and
planets
those
who
consecrate
their
to
the
discovery
of
the
fundamental
elements
of
the
world
system
are
all
of
them
calculators
and
observers
precursors
of
the
new
astronomy
these
are
immense
labors
studies
worthy
of
admiration
and
important
works
which
bring
to
light
the
highest
faculties
of
the
human
mind
but
it
is
the
army
of
the
past
mathematicians
and
geometricians
henceforth
the
hearts
of
savants
will
throb
for
a
still
nobler
conquest
all
these
great
minds
never
really
left
the
earth
while
studying
the
skies
astronomy
aim
is
not
to
show
us
the
apparent
position
of
shining
specks
nor
to
weigh
stones
moving
through
space
nor
to
foretell
eclipses
or
the
phases
of
the
moon
or
tides
all
this
is
fine
but
it
is
not
enough
if
life
did
not
exist
upon
the
earth
that
planet
would
be
absolutely
devoid
of
interest
for
any
mind
whatsoever
and
the
same
remark
is
applicable
to
all
the
worlds
which
gravitate
around
the
thousands
of
millions
of
suns
in
the
wide
stretches
of
immensity
life
is
the
object
of
the
whole
creation
if
there
were
neither
life
nor
thought
it
would
all
be
null
and
void
you
are
destined
to
witness
an
entire
transformation
in
science
matter
will
give
place
to
mind
life
universal
i
asked
are
all
the
planets
of
our
solar
system
inhabited
are
the
myriads
of
worlds
which
people
the
infinite
lived
upon
do
those
forms
of
human
life
resemble
ours
shall
we
ever
know
them
the
epoch
of
your
life
upon
the
earth
even
the
duration
of
terrestrial
humanity
is
but
a
moment
in
eternity
i
did
not
understand
this
answer
to
my
questions
there
is
no
reason
why
all
the
worlds
should
be
inhabited
she
went
on
the
present
period
is
of
no
more
importance
than
those
which
preceded
or
will
follow
it
the
length
of
the
earth
existence
will
be
longer
much
longer
perhaps
ten
times
longer
than
that
of
its
vital
human
period
out
of
a
dozen
worlds
selected
by
chance
from
immensity
we
could
for
example
find
hardly
one
inhabited
by
a
really
intelligent
race
some
have
been
already
others
will
be
in
the
future
these
are
in
preparation
those
have
run
through
all
their
phases
here
cradles
there
graves
and
then
too
an
infinite
variety
in
the
forces
of
nature
and
their
manifestations
is
revealed
earthly
life
being
in
no
way
the
type
of
existence
beings
can
think
live
in
wholly
different
organizations
from
those
with
which
you
are
familiar
on
your
own
planet
inhabitants
of
the
other
worlds
have
neither
your
form
nor
senses
they
are
otherwise
the
day
will
come
and
very
soon
since
you
are
called
to
see
it
when
the
study
of
the
conditions
of
life
in
the
various
provinces
of
the
universe
will
be
astronomy
essential
aim
and
chief
charm
soon
instead
of
being
concerned
simply
about
the
distance
the
motion
and
the
material
facts
of
your
neighboring
planets
astronomers
will
discover
their
physical
constitution
for
example
their
geographical
appearance
their
climatology
their
meteorology
will
solve
the
mystery
of
their
vital
organizations
and
will
discuss
their
inhabitants
they
will
find
that
mars
and
venus
are
actually
peopled
by
thinking
beings
that
jupiter
is
still
in
its
primary
period
of
organic
preparation
that
saturn
looks
down
upon
us
under
quite
different
conditions
from
those
which
were
instrumental
in
the
establishment
of
terrestrial
life
and
without
passing
through
a
state
analogous
to
that
of
earth
will
be
inhabited
by
beings
incompatible
with
earthly
organisms
new
methods
will
tell
about
the
physical
and
chemical
constitutions
of
the
stars
and
the
nature
of
their
atmospheres
perfected
instruments
will
permit
the
discovery
of
direct
proofs
of
existence
in
these
planetary
humanities
and
the
idea
of
putting
self
in
communication
with
them
this
is
the
scientific
transformation
which
will
mark
the
close
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
inaugurate
the
twentieth
illustration
i
listened
with
delight
to
these
words
of
the
celestial
muse
which
shed
an
entirely
different
light
upon
the
future
of
astronomy
and
filled
me
with
renewed
ardor
before
my
eyes
was
a
panorama
of
innumerable
worlds
moving
in
space
and
i
understood
that
the
true
object
of
science
is
to
teach
us
about
those
far
distant
universes
and
allow
us
to
live
in
those
wide
horizons
the
beautiful
goddess
resumed
illustration
astronomy
mission
will
be
still
higher
after
making
you
know
and
feel
that
the
earth
is
but
a
city
in
the
celestial
country
and
man
a
citizen
of
heaven
she
will
go
still
farther
disclosing
the
plan
on
which
the
physical
universe
is
constructed
she
will
show
that
the
moral
universe
is
constructed
on
the
very
same
basis
that
the
two
worlds
form
but
one
world
and
that
mind
governs
matter
what
she
will
have
done
for
space
she
will
do
for
time
after
realizing
the
boundlessness
of
space
and
recognizing
that
the
same
laws
govern
all
places
simultaneously
and
make
the
vast
universe
one
grand
unit
you
will
learn
that
the
centuries
of
the
past
and
of
the
future
are
linked
with
the
present
and
that
thinking
monads
will
live
forever
through
successive
and
progressive
changes
you
will
learn
that
minds
exist
incomparably
superior
to
the
greatest
minds
of
earthly
humanity
and
that
all
things
advance
toward
supreme
perfection
you
will
learn
too
that
the
material
form
is
but
an
appearance
and
that
the
real
being
consists
of
an
imponderable
intangible
and
invisible
form
astronomy
will
then
be
eminently
and
above
all
else
the
directress
of
philosophy
those
who
reason
without
astronomical
knowledge
will
never
reach
the
truth
those
who
follow
her
beacon
faithfully
will
gradually
rise
to
the
solutions
of
the
greatest
problems
astronomical
philosophy
will
be
the
religion
of
lofty
minds
you
will
see
this
double
transformation
in
science
she
added
when
you
leave
the
terrestrial
globe
the
astronomical
knowledge
which
you
already
so
justly
prize
will
be
entirely
remodelled
in
form
as
well
as
spirit
but
this
is
not
all
the
renewal
of
an
old
science
will
be
of
little
use
to
mankind
in
general
if
these
sublime
truths
which
develop
the
mind
enlighten
the
soul
and
free
it
from
vulgar
should
be
kept
shut
up
within
the
narrow
limits
of
professional
astronomers
this
time
too
will
pass
away
we
must
begin
anew
the
torch
must
be
taken
in
hand
and
its
glory
increased
by
carrying
it
into
the
busy
streets
and
public
squares
every
one
is
called
to
receive
the
light
every
one
is
thirsting
for
it
especially
the
humble
those
on
whom
fortune
frowns
for
these
are
the
persons
who
think
most
these
are
eager
for
knowledge
while
the
contented
ones
of
the
century
do
not
suspect
their
own
ignorance
and
are
almost
proud
of
staying
in
it
yes
the
light
of
astronomy
must
be
diffused
throughout
the
world
it
must
filter
through
the
strata
of
humanity
to
the
popular
masses
enlighten
their
consciences
elevate
their
hearts
that
will
be
its
most
beautiful
and
its
grandest
greatest
mission

thus
spoke
my
celestial
guide
her
face
was
glorious
as
the
day
her
eyes
shone
with
a
starry
lustre
her
voice
was
like
divine
music
i
looked
at
the
worlds
about
us
revolving
in
space
and
felt
that
a
mighty
harmony
controlled
the
course
of
nature
now
let
us
return
to
the
earth
she
said
pointing
to
the
spot
where
our
terrestrial
sun
had
disappeared
but
look
again
you
understand
now
that
space
is
infinite
you
will
soon
comprehend
that
time
is
eternal
we
crossed
other
constellations
and
came
back
toward
the
solar
system
i
saw
the
sun
reappear
looking
like
a
little
star
for
an
instant
said
she
i
am
going
to
give
you
if
not
divine
at
least
angelic
sight
your
soul
shall
feel
the
ethereal
vibrations
which
constitute
light
itself
and
shall
know
that
the
history
of
each
world
is
eternal

see
is
to
know

just
as
a
microscope
shows
us
an
ant
as
large
as
an
elephant
and
penetrates
the
infinitely
small
making
the
invisible
visible
so
at
the
muse
command
my
sight
suddenly
acquired
an
unknown
power
of
perception
and
distinguished
the
earth
in
space
very
near
the
sun
which
was
in
eclipse
and
from
invisible
it
became
visible
i
recognized
it
and
as
i
watched
its
disk
grew
larger
looking
like
the
moon
a
few
days
before
the
full
after
a
while
i
could
distinguish
the
principal
geographical
aspects
in
the
growing
disk
the
snowy
patch
at
the
north
pole
the
outlines
of
europe

the
more
steadily
i
fixed
my
gaze
the
better
i
could
see
details
became
more
and
more
perceptible
as
if
i
were
gradually
changing
the
lenses
of
a
microscope
i
recognized
the
geographical
form
of
france
but
our
beautiful
country
appeared
to
be
entirely
green
from
the
rhine
to
the
ocean
from
the
channel
to
the
mediterranean
as
if
it
were
covered
with
one
immense

succeeded
however
better
and
better
in
distinguishing
the
slightest
details
for
the
alps
the
pyrenees
the
rhine
the

the

were
easily
found

my
companion
as
she
said
this
she
placed
the
tips
of
her
slender
fingers
lightly
on
my
brow
as
though
she
had
wished
to
magnetize
my
brain
and
endow
my
perceptive
faculties
with
still
greater
power
then
i
looked
again
more
intently
at
the
vision
and
saw
before
my
eyes
gaul
in
the
time
of
julius
cÃ¦sar
it
was
during
the
war

independence
aroused
by
the
patriotism

vercingetorix

are
at

requires
all

separates
us
from

astronomers

who
are
observing

situated
as
far
from
them
as
we
are

not
see
them

they
really
are

as
they
were
when
the
rays
of

which
they
see
left
them

is
to
say
as
they
were
more
than
eighteen
centuries
ago

just
as
when
you
hear
a
clock
strike
you
receive
the
sound
after
it
has
left
it
and
as
long
after
as
you
are
far
from
it
the
result
is
that
the
history
of
all
these
worlds
actually
travels
through
space
never
entirely
disappearing
that
all
past
events
are
present
and
indestructible
in
the
bosom
of
the
infinite
the
universe
will
endure
forever
the
earth
will
come
to
an
end
and
some
day
will
be
nothing
but
a
tomb
but
there
will
be
new
suns
and
new
earths
new
springs
and
new
smiles
and
life
will
always
bloom
afresh

limitless

pause
how
eternal

urania
was
still
speaking
in
her
gentle
voice
but
my
brain
was
so
confused
by
the
commotion
aroused
in
it
by
so
many
extraordinary
scenes
that
i
was
seized
by
a
fit
of
trembling
a
shiver
ran
over
me
from
head
to
foot
which
was
probably
the
cause
of
my
abrupt
awakening
in
a
state
of
great
agitation
alas
the
delightful
celestial
journey
had
ended
i
looked
about
for
urania
but
could
not
find
her
a
bright
moonbeam
shining
through
my
bedroom
window
lightly
touched
the
edge
of
a
curtain
and
seemed
vaguely
to
outline
the
aerial
form
of
my
heavenly
guide
but
it
was
only
a
moonbeam
when
i
went
back
to
the
observatory
the
next
morning
my
first
impulse
was
to
find
some
pretext
for
going
to
the
director
study
to
see
the
charming
muse
again
who
had
rewarded
me
by
such
a
dream
the
clock
had
disappeared
in
its
place
stood
a
white
marble
bust
of
the
illustrious
astronomer
i
looked
through
the
other
rooms
even
the
private
apartments
under
a
thousand
different
excuses
but
she
was
nowhere
to
be
found
i
searched
for
days
and
weeks
but
could
neither
find
her
nor
learn
what
had
become
of
her
i
had
a
friend
and
confidant
very
near
my
own
age
although
appearing
older
from
his
sprouting
beard
he
too
was
very
fond
of
the
ideal
and
perhaps
even
more
of
a
dreamer
besides
he
was
the
only
person
at
the
observatory
with
whom
i
was
ever
on
intimate
terms
he
shared
my
joys
and
griefs
we
had
the
same
tastes
the
same
ideas
the
same
feelings
he
understood
my
youthful
admiration
for
the
statue
the
personality
with
which
my
imagination
had
invested
her
and
my
unhappiness
at
having
thus
suddenly
lost
my
dearest
urania
just
when
i
was
most
attached
to
her
he
had
more
than
once
admired
with
me
the
effect
of
the
light
upon
her
celestial
countenance
and
smiled
at
my
ecstasies
like
a
big
brother
even
teasing
me
a
little
sharply
about
my
affection
for
an
idol
going
so
far
as
to
call
me
camille
pygmalion
but
at
heart
i
knew
that
he
too
loved
her
this
friend
who
alas
was
to
be
torn
from
me
a
few
years
later
in
the
very
flower

whose
memory
will
be
ever
dear

me
was
the
director
private

and
his
sincere
affection
for
me
was
proved
in
this
instance
by
an
act
of
kindness
as
graceful
as
it
was
unexpected
when
i
went
home
one
day
i
saw
with
a
bewilderment
the
famous
clock
standing
on
my
there
just
in
front
of
me
it
was
really
she
how
did
she
come
there
what
brought
her
there
where
did
she
come
from
i
learned
that
the
celebrated
discoverer
of
neptune
had
sent
it
to
one
of
the
principal
in
paris
to
be
repaired
that
the
latter
had
received
a
most
interesting
antique
astronomical
clock
from
china
and
had
offered
it
in
exchange
which
had
been
accepted
and
that
george
spero
to
whom
the
transaction
had
been
intrusted
had
pradier
work
as
a
gift
for
me
his
parents
were
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
please
me
in
remembrance
of
some
lessons
in
mathematics
which
i
had
given
george
for
his
special
examination
illustration
what
joy
it
was
to
see
my
urania
again
how
happy
i
was
to
feast
my
eyes
on
her
once
more
that
charming
personification
of
the
muse
of
heaven
has
never
left
me
since
in
my
studious
hours
the
beautiful
statue
always
stood
before
me
seeming
to
remind
me
of
the
conversation
to
tell
me
the
destinies
of
astronomy
to
direct
me
in
my
youthful
scientific
aspirations
since
then
more
passionate
emotions
have
beguiled
me
captivated
me
and
troubled
my
senses
but
i
shall
never
forget
the
ideal
sentiment
with
which
the
muse
of
the
stars
had
inspired
me
the
celestial
journey
on
which
she
bore
me
away
the
unexpected
panoramas
she
unrolled
before
my
eyes
the
truths
she
revealed
to
me
as
to
the
extent
of
the
universe
nor
the
happiness
she
gave
me
by
definitively
settling
my
mind
on
the
calm
contemplation
of
nature
and
science

and

senior
of

students

george
spero
had
finished
his
lyceum
studies
at
a
very
early
age
but
they
teach
nothing
unless
it
be
how
to
work
and
he
continued
to
investigate
the
great
problems
of
natural
science
with
indefatigable
ardor
astronomy
especially
had
at
first
attracted
his
interest
i
had
known
him
as
the
reader
of
the
first
part
of
this
book
may
remember
at
the
paris
observatory
which
he
had
entered
at
the
age
of
sixteen
and
where
he
had
somewhat
distinguished
himself
by
a
rather
strange
peculiarity
that
of
having
no
ambition
and
no
desire
whatever
for
advancement
at
the
age
of
sixteen
as
at
he
believed
himself
to
be
on
the
verge
of
the
grave
judging
perhaps
that
life
indeed
passes
quickly
and
that
it
is
useless
to
wish
for
anything
beyond
the
happiness
of
studying
and
knowing
he
was
not
very
talkative
although
at
heart
his
disposition
was
that
of
a
playful
child
his
small
mouth
seemed
to
smile
if
one
carefully
examined
its
corners
otherwise
it
looked
somewhat
pensive
and
as
though
made
for
silence
his
eyes
whose
undecided
color
reminded
one
of
the
on
the
sea
horizon
changed
with
the
light
and
in
accordance
with
his
moods
they
were
usually
gentle
but
on
occasion
would
flash
like
lightning
or
grow
as
cold
as
steel
their
glance
was
deep
sometimes
unfathomable
even
strange
and
enigmatical
his
ear
was
small
gracefully
curved
the
lobe
well
detached
and
a
little
raised
which
to
analysts
is
an
indication
of
refinement
the
brow
was
broad
although
his
head
was
rather
small
but
seemed
larger
from
his
glistening
thickly
waving
hair
his
beard
was
brown
like
his
hair
and
slightly
curled
of
medium
height
his
whole
effect
was
elegant
with
a
natural
ease
he
dressed
carefully
but
without
pretence
or
affectation
my
friends
and
i
never
had
any
special
companionship
with
him
holidays
and
leisure
hours
he
never
spent
with
us
always
occupied
with
his
books
he
seemed
to
have
given
himself
up
without
reserve
to
hunting
for
the
philosopher
stone
the
quadrature
of
the
circle
or
perpetual
motion
i
never
knew
him
to
have
a
friend
unless
it
were
myself
and
yet
i
am
not
sure
that
he
gave
me
all
his
confidences
though
for
that
matter
perhaps
there
was
no
special
event
in
his
life
except
the
one
of
which
i
now
make
myself
the
historian
and
which
i
knew
all
about
as
an
if
not
as
confidant
the
problem
of
the
soul
was
the
perpetual
torment
of
his
thought
sometimes
he
was
so
absorbed
in
his
search
for
the
unknown
with
such
intense
cerebral
action
that
he
felt
a
sensation
of
tingling
in
his
head
which
seemed
to
exhaust
all
his
thinking
faculties
this
was
especially
the
case
when
after
having
analyzed
the
conditions
of
immortality
for
a
long
time
he
saw
real
ephemeral
life
suddenly
disappear
and
endless
immortality
open
before
his
mental
being
in
the
face
of
this
aspect
of
the
soul
in
full
eternity
he
longed
the
sight
of
his
own
body
pale
and
stiff
wrapped
in
and
lying
in
its
coffin
left
deserted
in
its
last
mournful
at
the
bottom
of
a
narrow
grave
under
the
grass
where
the
cricket
chirps
did
not
appall
his
thought
so
much
as
the
uncertainty
about
the
future
what
will
become
of
me
what
will
become
of
us
he
repeated
like
the
constant
clashing
of
a
fixed
idea
in
his
brain
if
we
die
utterly
what
an
absurd
farce
life
is
with
its
hopes
and
struggles
if
we
are
immortal
what
do
we
do
with
ourselves
through
endless
eternity
where
shall
i
be
a
hundred
years
from
now
where
will
all
the
present
dwellers
of
the
earth
be
to
die
for
ever
and
ever
to
have
existed
but
for
a
moment
what
a
mockery
would
it
not
be
better
a
hundred
times
over
never
to
have
been
born
but
if
it
be
our
fate
to
live
eternally
and
never
to
be
able
to
change
anything
of
the
fatality
that
carries
us
along
having
endless
eternity
always
before
us
how
can
we
bear
the
burden
of
such
a
destiny
is
that
the
doom
awaiting
us
if
we
should
tire
of
existence
we
should
be
forbidden
to
fly
from
it
it
would
be
impossible
to
end
it
in
this
conception
there
is
far
more
implacable
cruelty
than
in
that
of
an
ephemeral
life
vanishing
away
like
an
insect
flight
in
the
fresh
evening
breeze
why
then
were
we
born
to
suffer
uncertainty
to
find
after
examination
not
a
single
one
of
our
hopes
left
to
live
like
idiots
if
we
do
not
think
like
fools
if
we
do
and
yet
they
tell
us
of
a
god
there
are
religions
priests
rabbis
bonzes
why
mankind
is
but
a
race
of
dupes
and
duped
religion
is
the
same
as
patriotism
and
the
priest
is
as
good
as
the
soldier
men
of
all
nations
arm
themselves
to
the
teeth
that
they
may
kill
one
another
like
simpletons
ah
it
is
the
wisest
thing
they
could
do
the
best
return
they
could
make
to
nature
for
the
foolish
gift
she
bestowed
in
causing
them
to
be
born
illustration
i
tried
to
lessen
his
pain
and
anxiety
having
a
certain
philosophy
of
my
own
which
was
relatively
satisfactory
to
me
the
fear
of
death
seems
absolutely
chimerical
said
i
there
are
but
two
hypotheses
to
make
about
it
every
night
it
may
be
that
we
shall
not
wake
again
the
next
morning
and
yet
when
we
think
of
it
this
idea
does
not
prevent
our
going
to
sleep
now
then
first
either
all
being
ended
with
life
we
do
not
wake
again
anywhere
and
in
that
case
it
is
a
sleep
that
has
not
ended
but
which
will
endure
throughout
eternity
so
that
we
shall
never
know
anything
about
it
or
else
secondly
the
soul
outliving
the
body
we
shall
wake
up
somewhere
else
and
continue
our
activity
in
that
case
there
is
nothing
to
fear
in
the
awakening
it
should
rather
attract
us
there
is
a
reason
for
all
things
in
nature
and
every
creature
the
meanest
as
well
as
the
noblest
finds
his
happiness
in
the
exercise
of
his
faculties
illustration
this
reasoning
seemed
to
calm
him
but
the
restlessness
of
doubt
soon
returned
pricking
like
thorns
sometimes
he
would
wander
off
alone
through
the
spacious
cemeteries
of
paris
seeking
out
the
most
deserted
alleys
between
the
graves
listening
to
the
wind
among
the
trees
and
the
rustle
of
the
leaves
in
the
paths
sometimes
he
went
away
into
the
woods
in
the
suburbs
of
the
great
city
and
would
walk
about
for
hours
at
a
time
muttering
to
himself
at
other
times
he
would
spend
a
whole
day
in
his
study
in
the
place
du
panthÃ©on
which
he
used
as
study
work
and
reception
room
at
the
same
time
and
there
until
far
into
the
night
he
would
dissect
a
brain
brought
back
from
the
clinic
studying
the
small
slices
of
gray
substance
through
his
microscope
the
uncertainty
of
the
sciences
called
positive
the
sudden
halt
to
his
mind
in
the
solution
of
these
problems
threw
him
into
fits
of
deepest
despair
and
i
have
found
him
many
times
in
a
state
of
utter
prostration
his
eyes
set
and
shining
his
hands
burning
with
fever
his
pulse
agitated
and
intermittent
in
one
of
these
crises
i
was
obliged
to
leave
him
for
a
few
hours
and
almost
feared
i
should
not
find
him
alive
on
my
return
at
about
five
in
the
morning
he
had
near
him
a
glass
of
cyanide
of
potassium
which
he
tried
to
hide
as
i
came
in
but
recovering
his
calmness
almost
at
once
he
said
with
great
serenity
and
a
slight
smile
what
is
the
good
if
we
are
immortal
it
would
be
of
no
use
and
i
wanted
to
know
about
it
sooner
that
day
he
acknowledged
he
believed
that
he
had
been
lifted
painfully
by
his
hair
to
the
ceiling
and
allowed
to
drop
with
all
his
weight
upon
the
floor
public
indifference
with
regard
to
the
great
problem
of
human
destiny
a
question
which
in
his
eyes
exceeded
all
others
in
importance
since
it
treated
of
our
continued
existence
or
destruction
exasperated
him
to
the
last
degree
all
about
him
he
saw
people
who
were
occupied
solely
by
material
interests
entirely
absorbed
by
the
foolish
idea
of
making
money
for
which
they
gave
up
all
their
years
their
days
their
hours
their
minutes
disguised
under
various
forms
and
he
found
no
free
independent
mind
living
an
intellectual
life
it
seemed
to
him
that
sentient
beings
could
while
living
the
bodily
life
since
one
can
not
do
otherwise
at
least
not
remain
the
slaves
of
so
coarse
an
organization
but
devote
the
best
moments
to
their
intellectual
life
at
the
time
this
story
begins
george
spero
was
already
well
known
and
even
famed
by
the
original
scientific
books
which
he
had
published
and
also
by
several
books
of
high
literary
merit
which
had
won
praise
for
his
name
in
all
parts
of
the
world
although
he
had
not
yet
completed
his
year
thousands
of
persons
had
read
his
books
which
however
were
not
written
for
the
general
public
but
had
been
so
successful
as
to
be
appreciated
by
the
majority
who
desire
to
learn
as
well
as
by
the
enlightened
minority
he
had
been
proclaimed
master
of
a
new
school
and
eminent
critics
knowing
neither
his
physical
individuality
nor
his
age
spoke
of
his
doctrines
how
did
it
happen
that
this
philosopher
of
such
rare
ability
this
stern
student
should
be
at
a
young
girl
feet
at
sunset
on
the
terrace
where
we
met
them
just
now
the
rest
of
the
story
will
tell
you
illustration
illustration
ii
the
apparition
their
first
meeting
had
been
a
very
strange
one
the
young
naturalist
was
a
passionate
admirer
of
the
beauties
of
nature
and
was
always
looking
for
grand
effects
the
year
before
he
had
made
a
journey
to
norway
to
visit
the
silent
fiords
in
which
the
sea
was
swallowed
up
the
mountains
whose
summits
lift
their
spotless
brows
far
above
the
clouds
and
to
make
a
special
study
of
the
aurora
borealis
that
most
magnificent
exhibition
of
our
planet
life
i
had
accompanied
him
on
the
journey
the
sunsets
over
the
deep
calm
fiords
the
rise
of
the
splendid
orb
on
the
mountains
charmed
his
poetic
and
artistic
soul
with
an
indescribable
emotion
we
remained
there
more
than
a
month
going
through
the
picturesque
region
of
the
scandinavian
alps
now
norway
was
the
home
of
that
child
of
the
north
who
was
to
exert
so
strong
an
influence
over
his
unawakened
heart
she
was
there
only
a
few
steps
away
from
him
and
yet
it
was
not
until
the
very
day
we
left
that
chance
that
god
of
the
ancients
decided
to
bring
them
together
the
morning
light
was
gilding
the
distant
summits
the
young
norwegian
girl
father
had
brought
her
to
one
of
the
mountains
much
frequented
by
excursionists
like
the
righi
in
switzerland
to
see
the
sunrise
which
that
day
was
of
surpassing
beauty
to
better
distinguish
certain
details
of
the
landscape
iclÃ©a
had
mounted
a
little
hillock
a
few
yards
farther
away
and
was
quite
alone
when
turning
with
her
face
from
the
sun
to
embrace
the
whole
horizon
she
saw
her
own
image
her
whole
figure
not
on
the
mountain
nor
the
earth
but
on
the
very
sky
itself
a
luminous
aureole
framed
her
head
and
shoulders
with
a
shining
crown
of
glory
and
a
large
aerial
circle
faintly
tinted
with
the
colors
of
the
rainbow
surrounded
the
mysterious
apparition
illustration
astonished
and
touched
by
the
singularity
of
the
vision
and
still
under
the
influence
of
the
gorgeous
sunrise
she
did
not
at
first
notice
that
another
face
that
of
a
man
was
by
the
side
of
her
own
the
motionless
silhouette
of
a
traveller
in
contemplation
before
her
recalling
the
statues
of
saints
on
their
pedestals
in
churches
this
masculine
figure
and
her
own
were
framed
in
by
the
same
aerial
circle
suddenly
she
perceived
the
strange
profile
in
the
air
and
thought
herself
the
plaything
of
a
fantastic
vision
she
started
back
in
her
amazement
with
a
gesture
of
surprise
almost
of
fear
her
image
in
the
air
reproduced
the
same
gesture
and
she
saw
the
traveller
wraith
put
his
hand
to
his
hat
and
take
it
off
as
if
he
were
bowing
to
the
heavens
then
lose
the
clearness
of
its
outlines
and
fade
away
at
the
same
time
as
her
own
figure
illustration
the
transfiguration
on
mount
tabor
when
the
disciples
of
jesus
suddenly
saw
their
master
image
on
the
sky
accompanied
by
those
of
moses
and
elias
could
not
have
caused
its
witnesses
any
greater
stupefaction
than
the
innocent
norwegian
girl
felt
before
this
whose
theory
is
well
known
to
all
meteorologists
this
apparition
fixed
itself
upon
her
mental
retina
like
a
marvellous
dream
she
called
her
father
who
had
remained
a
few
steps
away
from
the
little
mound
but
when
he
reached
her
it
had
all
disappeared
she
asked
him
to
explain
it
but
he
replied
only
by
a
doubt
almost
a
denial
of
the
truth
of
the
phenomenon
the
excellent
man
formerly
a
belonged
to
that
category
of
distinguished
sceptics
who
simply
deny
everything
of
which
they
are
ignorant
or
which
they
can
not
explain
it
was
all
in
vain
that
the
lovely
girl
assured
him
that
she
had
seen
her
reflection
in
the
sky
and
also
that
of
a
man
whom
she
judged
was
young
and
all
in
vain
that
she
related
the
details
of
the
apparition
and
added
that
the
figures
were
much
larger
than
like
enormous
silhouettes
he
declared
authoritatively
and
with
considerable
emphasis
that
it
was
what
is
called
an
optical
illusion
produced
by
the
imagination
when
one
has
not
slept
well
particularly
in
youth
but
on
the
evening
of
that
day
as
we
were
going
on
board
the
steamer
i
noticed
a
young
girl
with
hair
who
was
looking
at
my
friend
in
open
astonishment
she
had
her
father
arm
and
was
standing
on
the
wharf
as
motionless
as
lot
wife
turned
into
a
pillar
of
salt
i
signed
to
my
friend
but
no
sooner
had
he
turned
his
head
towards
her
than
i
saw
her
face
crimson
with
a
sudden
flush
she
at
once
turned
away
and
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
which
was
just
beginning
to
move
i
do
not
know
whether
spero
noticed
her
confusion
as
a
fact
we
had
seen
nothing
of
that
morning
aerial
phenomenon
at
least
not
while
the
young
girl
was
near
us
and
she
had
been
hidden
from
us
by
a
little
clump
of
bushes
the
magnificence
of
the
sunrise
had
drawn
us
rather
to
the
western
side
however
he
saluted
norway
which
he
regretted
to
leave
with
the
same
gesture
with
which
he
had
greeted
the
rising
sun
and
the
pretty
stranger
had
taken
the
bow
for
herself
two
months
later
the
comte
de
k
gave
a
large
reception
in
honor
of
the
recent
successes
of
his
compatriot
christine
nilsson
the
young
norwegian
girl
and
her
father
who
had
come
to
paris
to
pass
a
part
of
the
winter
were
among
the
guests
who
had
long
known
each
other
as
norway
and
sweden
being
sisters
we
went
there
for
the
first
time
our
invitation
being
due
to
the
appearance
of
latest
book
which
had
already
met
with
signal
success
iclÃ©a
was
a
dreamy
thoughtful
girl
well
informed
thanks
to
the
sound
education
given
in
northern
countries
she
was
eager
to
learn
and
had
read
and
with
curiosity
the
somewhat
mystical
book
in
which
the
new
metaphysician
dissatisfied
with
pascal
thoughts
had
laid
bare
his
soul
anxieties
several
months
before
she
had
successfully
passed
the
examination
and
having
abandoned
the
study
of
medicine
which
had
at
first
attracted
her
was
beginning
to
look
with
some
curiosity
into
the
recent
investigations
of
psychological
physiology
illustration
when
george
spero
was
announced
she
felt
that
an
unknown
friend
almost
a
confidant
had
arrived
she
started
as
if
from
an
electric
shock
he
was
not
much
of
a
society
man
timid
ill
at
ease
in
mixed
assemblies
he
did
not
care
to
dance
play
or
converse
but
preferred
to
stay
apart
in
one
corner
of
the
room
with
some
friends
quite
indifferent
to
the
waltzes
and
quadrilles
but
more
attentive
to
several
masterpieces
of
modern
music
feelingly
played
the
entire
evening
passed
without
his
being
near
her
although
he
had
noticed
her
and
in
all
that
brilliant
ball
had
seen
but
her
their
eyes
met
many
times
at
last
about
two
in
the
morning
when
the
company
was
less
formal
he
ventured
to
approach
her
without
speaking
however
it
was
she
who
first
spoke
to
him
to
express
a
doubt
about
the
conclusion
of
his
last
book
illustration
flattered
but
still
more
surprised
to
learn
that
those
metaphysical
pages
had
had
so
young
a
reader
and
a
lady
too
the
author
replied
rather
awkwardly
that
those
investigations
were
somewhat
uninteresting
for
a
woman
she
answered
that
women
and
even
young
girls
were
not
exclusively
absorbed
in
frivolity
that
she
knew
several
who
occasionally
worked
thought
endeavored
and
studied
she
spoke
with
a
good
deal
of
spirit
defending
women
against
the
contempt
of
certain
scientists
of
the
other
sex
and
maintained
their
intellectual
equality
she
had
no
trouble
in
winning
a
cause
to
which
her
listener
was
by
no
means
hostile
the
new
book
whose
success
had
been
immediate
and
brilliant
notwithstanding
the
gravity
of
its
subject
had
surrounded
george
spero
name
with
an
actual
halo
of
fame
and
the
brilliant
writer
was
warmly
welcomed
in
every
the
two
young
people
had
exchanged
but
a
few
words
when
they
found
themselves
the
general
object
of
attention
and
were
forced
to
reply
to
different
questions
which
interrupted
their
interview
one
of
the
most
eminent
critics
of
the
day
had
recently
devoted
a
long
article
to
the
new
work
and
the
subject
of
the
book
became
at
once
the
topic
of
general
conversation
iclÃ©a
took
no
part
in
it
but
she
felt
and
women
are
not
often
mistaken
that
the
hero
had
noticed
her
that
her
thought
was
already
linked
to
his
by
an
invisible
thread
and
that
while
he
replied
to
the
more
or
less
questions
thrust
upon
him
his
mind
was
not
wholly
on
the
conversation
this
first
little
triumph
was
enough
she
cared
for
no
other
and
moreover
she
had
recognized
in
his
profile
both
the
mysterious
silhouette
in
the
aerial
apparition
and
the
young
stranger
on
the
steamer
at
christiania
in
that
first
interview
he
had
not
hesitated
to
express
his
enthusiastic
admiration
for
the
marvellous
scenery
in
norway
and
to
tell
her
about
his
visit
there
she
was
eager
for
a
word
some
sort
of
an
allusion
to
the
aerial
phenomenon
which
had
made
so
great
an
impression
upon
her
and
could
not
understand
his
silence
in
regard
to
it
not
having
observed
the
when
she
was
reflected
upon
it
he
had
not
been
particularly
surprised
at
an
occurrence
which
he
had
already
studied
before
and
under
better
conditions
from
the
car
of
a
balloon
and
having
seen
nothing
specially
noticeable
had
nothing
to
say
about
it
the
occurrence
at
the
steamboat
landing
too
had
entirely
passed
from
his
memory
so
that
although
the
fair
beauty
of
the
young
girl
did
not
seem
entirely
unfamiliar
to
him
yet
he
had
no
recollection
of
having
met
her
before
as
for
me
i
had
recognized
her
at
once
he
talked
about
the
lakes
rivers
fiords
and
mountains
of
norway
learned
from
her
that
her
mother
had
died
very
young
from
that
her
father
preferred
living
in
paris
to
anywhere
else
and
that
it
was
probable
she
should
not
visit
her
native
land
except
at
rare
intervals
for
the
future
a
remarkable
identity
of
ideas
and
tastes
a
ready
and
mutual
sympathy
a
reciprocal
respect
soon
made
them
friends
brought
up
and
educated
with
english
ideas
she
enjoyed
that
independence
of
mind
and
freedom
of
action
which
frenchwomen
never
know
until
after
marriage
she
felt
hampered
by
none
of
the
social
conventionalities
which
with
us
are
supposed
to
protect
innocence
and
virtue
two
friends
of
her
own
age
had
even
come
to
paris
to
finish
their
musical
education
they
were
living
together
in
the
very
heart
of
babylon
in
perfect
safety
never
even
suspecting
the
dangers
by
which
paris
is
said
to
be
beset
the
young
girl
received
george
spero
visits
as
her
father
would
have
received
them
himself
and
in
a
few
weeks
the
congeniality
in
their
tastes
and
dispositions
had
united
them
in
the
same
studies
the
same
researches
often
in
the
very
same
thoughts
almost
every
afternoon
he
went
drawn
by
a
secret
attraction
from
the
latin
quarter
along
the
borders
of
the
seine
as
far
as
the
trocadÃ©ro
and
passed
several
hours
with
iclÃ©a
either
in
the
library
on
the
or
walking
in
the
wood
the
first
impression
aroused
by
the
apparition
on
the
sky
had
remained
in
iclÃ©a
mind
she
looked
up
to
the
young
savant
if
not
as
a
god
or
hero
at
least
as
a
man
far
superior
to
his
contemporaries
the
perusal
of
his
works
strengthened
this
feeling
and
increased
it
she
felt
more
than
admiration
she
had
an
actual
veneration
for
him
when
she
knew
him
personally
the
great
man
did
not
descend
from
his
pedestal
she
found
him
so
high
so
excellent
in
his
works
his
inquiries
his
studies
and
at
the
same
time
so
simple
so
sincere
so
so
indulgent
to
all
and
seizing
any
pretext
for
hearing
him
talked
about
she
was
sometimes
forced
to
listen
to
such
unjust
criticisms
upon
him
from
rivals
that
she
began
to
have
an
almost
maternal
feeling
for
him
does
the
sentiment
of
protecting
affection
exist
in
every
young
girl
heart
perhaps
but
assuredly
she
loved
him
thus
at
first
i
have
already
said
that
the
basis
of
this
thinker
character
was
somewhat
melancholy
that
melancholy
of
the
soul
of
which
pascal
speaks
and
which
is
like
homesickness
for
heaven
in
fact
he
was
ever
seeking
to
solve
the
eternal
question
hamlet
to
be
or
not
to
be
sometimes
he
would
be
sad
downcast
but
by
a
singular
contrast
when
his
unhappy
thoughts
had
worn
themselves
out
so
to
speak
in
vain
research
and
his
exhausted
brain
had
lost
the
power
of
further
vibration
a
kind
of
repose
came
to
him
he
recovered
his
ordinary
quiet
the
circulation
of
his
red
blood
stimulated
his
organic
life
philosophy
disappeared
leaving
him
like
a
simple
child
amused
at
trifles
and
having
almost
feminine
tastes
delighting
in
flowers
perfumes
music
revery
he
appeared
sometimes
astonishingly

not
to
be
it
was
this
very
phase
of
his
intellectual
life
which
had
drawn
the
two
friends
so
intimately
together
happy
at
being
alive
in
the
flower
of
her
expanding
to
the
light
of
life
a
harp
thrilling
with
all
the
harmonies
of
nature
the
beautiful
northern
girl
still
sometimes
dreamed
of
the
fays
and
elves
of
her
native
clime
of
the
angels
and
mysteries
of
the
christian
religion
which
had
soothed
her
childhood
the
credulity
of
her
early
days
had
not
obscured
her
understanding
she
thought
freely
and
sought
sincerely
for
the
truth
while
regretting
perhaps
that
she
no
longer
believed
in
the
paradise
of
the
preachers
she
felt
nevertheless
a
strong
desire
to
live
forever
death
seemed
to
her
a
cruel
injustice
she
never
thought
of
her
mother
lying
on
her
in
the
ripe
beauty
of
her
thirtieth
year
taken
away
to
the
green
and
fragrant
cemetery
filled
with
the
songs
of
birds
while
the
roses
were
in
full
bloom
crossed
off
the
book
of
life
while
all
nature
still
sang
still
bloomed
and
shone
she
never
thought
of
her
mother
pale
face
as
i
said
without
a
sudden
shudder
creeping
all
over
her
from
head
to
foot
no
her
mother
was
not
dead
she
would
not
die
at
thirty
or
at
any
time
and
he
he
die
that
sublime
mind
to
be
blotted
out
by
a
stoppage
of
the
heart
or
breath
no
it
was
not
possible
men
are
mistaken
we
shall
know
some
day
then
too
sometimes
she
thought
of
these
mysteries
under
a
form
rather
more
Ã¦sthetic
and
sentimental
than
scientific
but
she
thought
of
them
all
her
questionings
her
doubts
the
secret
object
of
her
conversations
perhaps
her
rapidly
developed
attachment
for
her
friend
the
cause
of
it
all
was
the
insatiable
thirst
for
knowledge
which
consumed
her
soul
she
hoped
in
him
because
she
had
already
found
in
his
writings
a
solution
to
the
highest
problems
he
had
taught
her
to
know
the
universe
and
she
found
this
knowledge
more
beautiful
more
vivid
more
poetic
grander
than
the
old
errors
and
illusions
from
the
time
when
he
told
her
that
life
had
no
object
other
than
the
search
for
truth
she
had
felt
sure
that
he
would
find
it
and
her
mind
clung
to
and
bound
itself
to
his
even
more
strongly
than
her
heart
illustration
they
had
lived
a
common
intellectual
life
in
this
way
for
about
three
months
almost
every
day
spending
several
hours
reading
original
essays
written
in
different
languages
on
science
and
philosophy
the
theory
of
atoms
molecular
physics
organic
chemistry
and
the
different
sciences
whose
object
is
the
knowledge
of
existence
or
in
discoursing
upon
the
real
or
apparent
contradictions
of
hypotheses
sometimes
finding
statements
and
coincidences
most
remarkable
for
their
scientific
axioms
in
the
books
of
purely
literary
writers
and
occasionally
astonished
at
the
foresight
of
some
great
authors
these
readings
investigations
and
comparisons
had
especially
interested
them
by
the
discrimination
which
their
minds
were
led
to
make
as
they
became
more
and
more
enlightened
between
nine
tenths
of
the
writers
whose
works
are
absolutely
worthless
and
half
of
the
last
tenth
whose
writings
have
but
a
superficial
value
having
thus
cleared
the
field
of
literature
they
took
great
delight
and
satisfaction
in
the
restricted
society
of
superior
minds
perhaps
mixed
with
it
was
a
little
feeling
of
pride
one
day
spero
arrived
earlier
than
usual
eureka
he
cried
but
correcting
himself
quickly
added
perhaps
leaning
against
the
where
a
bright
fire
crackled
while
his
companion
looked
at
him
with
her
large
eyes
full
of
curiosity
he
began
to
speak
with
a
sort
of
unconscious
solemnity
as
though
he
were
discussing
something
with
his
own
mind
in
the
solitude
of
the
woods
what
we
see
is
only
apparent
reality
is
quite
different
the
sun
apparently
turns
about
us
rising
every
morning
setting
at
night
the
earth
where
we
are
seems
to
be
motionless
but
the
contrary
is
the
truth
we
live
on
a
whirling
projectile
thrown
into
space
with
a
speed
times
as
great
as
that
which
carries
a
our
ears
are
pleased
by
a
harmonious
concert
sound
does
not
exist
it
is
merely
an
impression
of
the
senses
produced
by
vibrations
of
a
certain
size
and
rapidity
on
the
air
which
in
themselves
are
silent
there
would
be
no
sound
without
the
acoustic
nerve
and
the
brain
in
reality
there
is
nothing
but
motion
the
rainbow
spreads
its
radiant
circle
the
rose
and
dripping
with
rain
glitter
in
the
sun
the
green
meadow
the
golden
furrow
diversify
the
plain
with
their
bright
colors
there
are
no

there
is
no
light
there
is
nothing
but
the
ether
waves
which
cause
a
vibration
of
the

appearances
are
deceitful
the

take
a
strong
iron
beam
like
one
of
those
used
so
generally
in
building
nowadays
it
is
set
up
in

ten
metres
high
between
two
walls
which
support
its
ends
it
is
in
the
middle
of
it
is
placed
a
weight
of
one
two
or
ten
thousand
kilograms
but
it
does
not
even
show
this
enormous
weight
a
level
would
hardly
find
a
depression
in
it
and
yet
this
beam
is
composed
of
particles
which
do
not
touch
each
other
which
are
in
perpetual
vibration
which
separate
under
the
influence
of
heat
and
are
drawn
together
by
cold
tell
me
if
you
please
in
what
the
solidity
of
this
bar
of
iron
consists
its
material
atoms
assuredly
not
since
they
do
not
touch
that
solidity
lies
in
molecular
attraction
that
is
to
say
in
an
immaterial
force
speaking
absolutely
solidity
does
not
exist
take
up
a
heavy
iron
this
ball
is
composed
of
invisible
molecules
which
do
not
touch
each
other
the
continuity
which
the
surface
seems
to
have
and
the
apparent
solidity
of
the
ball
are
then
pure
illusions
to
the
mind
which
would
analyze
it
its
inner
structure
is
an
eddying
swarm
of
little
gnats
like
those
darting
about
in
the
air
on
a
summer
day
then
suppose
we
heat
this
apparently
solid
ball
it
will
melt
heat
it
more
it
will
evaporate
but
without
changing
its
nature
for
all
that
gas
or
liquid
it
will
still
be
iron
we
are
in
a

all
these

these

these

this

the

are
also

by
a
perpetual

of

it

sits
down
expecting

ceaselessly
renews
itself
and
so
rapidly
that
in

our

is
reconstituted
from
estimates
founded
on

it

been
calculated

there
are
more

two
hundred

in

there
are
not

than
eight
sextillions
of

eight
thousand

greater

a

in

to
finish
the
enumeration
in

up

down

the

listened

him
as
one
listens
to
an
apostle
a
loved
apostle
and
although
he
had
really
spoken
but
for
her
he
had
not
apparently
realized
her
presence
she
had
been
so
silent
and
motionless
she
went
to
him
and
took
one
of
his
hands
in

oh
she
cried
if
you
have
not

conquered

she
can
not
elude
you
illustration
then
growing
excited
herself
and
alluding
to
an
reservation
of

think
she
added
that
it
is
impossible
for
terrestrial
man
to
attain
to
the
truth
because
we
have
but
five
senses
and
that
a
multitude
of
natural
manifestations
are
unknown
to
our
minds
because
we
have
no
means
of
reaching
them
just
as
sight
would
be
denied
us
if
we
were
deprived
of
the
optic
nerve
hearing
if
we
had
no

just

the
exhibitions
of

which
pass
between

of

organic
instrument
without
causing
those
we
have
to
quiver
are
unknown
to
us
i
concede
that
and
agree
with
you
that
the
inhabitants
of
certain

maybe
incomparably
more
advanced

in
our
terrestrial

are
missing
probably
a
citizen
of
the
sirius
system
would
laugh
at
our
pretentions
the

stronger
in

either
newton

leibnitz
and
the

the

of

better
than
did
christopher

or
magellan
what
did
i
say
just
now
that
appearances
are
deceitful
and
that
our
minds
must
see
invisible
force
through

that
is
perfectly
sure
matter
is
not
what
it
seems
to
be
and
no
man
informed
about
the
progress
of
the
positive
sciences
could
now
pretend
to
be
a
materialist
then
she
said
the
cerebral
atom
the
principle
of
human
organism
would
be
immortal
like
all
other
atoms
if
one
should
admit
the
fundamental
assertions
of
chemistry
but
it
would
differ
from
the
others
possessing
a
higher
rank
the
soul
being
attached
to
it
and
would
it
preserve
the
consciousness
of
its
existence
would
the
soul
be
comparable
to
an
electric
substance
once
i
saw
the
lightning
go
through
a

extinguish

when

found
that

off

that
the

silver

several
places
that
is
a
subtle
force
do
not
draw
comparisons
they
would
be
too
far
from
the
truth
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
soul
exists
as
force
does
we
can
admit
that
it
and
the
cerebral
atom
are
one
that
it
thus
survives
the
dissolution
of
the
body
we
can
imagine
but
what
becomes
of
it
where
does
it
go
the
greater
number
of
souls
never
even
suspect
their

out
of

fourteen
hundred

of

who
people

itself
into
the

swallowed
by
a
fish
in
the
dusky
depths
of
the

so
living
atoms
sleep
which
have
never

thinking

are
the
inheritance
of
the

they
preserve

patrimony

increase
it
for
the

without
this
immortality
of

souls
which
are
conscious
of
their

through

all
the

the

that
of

as
well

be
a

more

together
pleasant

intimate

was
something
lacking
these
conversations
on

topics

or
their
exchange
of
ideas
on
the
analysis
of
humanity
their
inquiries
into
the
final
end
of
the
existence
of

satisfied
their
minds
sometimes
but
not
their
hearts
when
they
had
been
together
for
a
long
time
talking
under
the
garden
trellis
which
towered
above
the
picture
of
the
great
city
or
in
the
silent
library
the
student
the
thinker
could
not
leave
his
companion
they
sat
hand
in

mute
attracted
and
repelled
by
an
irresistible
power
after
leaving
each
other
both
felt
a
singular
painful
void
in
their
breasts
an
indefinable
uneasiness
as
though
some
link
necessary
for
both
their
lives
had
been
broken
and
each
hoped
for
nothing
but
the
hour
of
meeting
he
loved
her
not
for
himself
but
for
herself
with
an
almost
impersonal
affection
with
a
feeling
of
high
esteem
as
well
as
ardent
love
and
by
a
constantly
fought
combat
with
his
desire
he
had
been
able
to
resist
it
but
one
day
when
they
were
both
sitting
on
the
wide
divan
in
the
library
strewn
as
usual
with
books
and
loose
leaves
a
silence
fell
upon
them
and
it
happened
that
overcome
perhaps
by
the
weight
of
his
efforts
to
resist
so
powerful
an
attraction
the
young
author
head
insensibly
drooped
to
his
companion
shoulder
and
almost
at
once
their
lips
met
oh
unutterable
joys
of
requited
love
insatiable
intoxication
of
the
heart
transported
with
happiness
delights

the
uncurbed
imagination

what
ethereal
heights
have
you
not
raised
the
chosen
ones
given
up
to
your
supreme
felicities
suddenly
forgetful
of
this
lower
world
they
fly
on
outstretched
wings
to
some
enchanted
paradise
lose
themselves
in
celestial
depths
and
soar
away
to
the
sublime
regions
of
eternal
rapture
the

with
its
joys
and
its

threw
the
lovers
into
an
ecstatic
existence
in
which
metaphysics
and
its

were
for
a
time
forgotten
this
lasted
six
months
the
sweetest

most
imperious

suddenly
absorbed

in

were
contemplating

walking
with
the

one

received

yet
by
degrees
perhaps
without
noticing
it
himself
the
young
philosopher
was
gradually
taking
up
again
by
shattered
fragments
his
interrupted
studies
analyzing
subjects
now
with
a
deep
feeling
of
optimism
which
he
had
never
known
before
in
spite
of
his
natural
kindliness
excluding
cruel
conclusions
because
they
seemed
to
him
to
be
due
to
an
insufficient
knowledge
of
causes
looking
at
the
panoramas
of
nature
and
of
humanity
in
a
new
light
she
too
had
taken
up
at
least
partially
the
studies
which
she
had
begun
in
common
with
him
but
a
new
feeling
filled
her
soul
and
her
mind
had
not
the
same
freedom
for
intellectual
work
absorbed
in
this
constant
affection
for
a
being
whom
she
had
wholly
won
she
saw
only
through
him
acted
only
by
him
in
quiet
evening
hours
when
she
went
to
the
piano
and
played
a
sonata
by
chopin
which
she
was
astonished
to
find
she
had
not
understood
until
she
was
in
love
or
to
accompany
her
pure
rich
voice
while
singing
the
norwegian
by
grieg
or
bull
or
our
own
gounod
melodies
it
seemed
to
her
unconsciously
perhaps
that
her
lover
was
the
only
listener
capable
of
appreciating
these
inspirations
of
the
heart
what
delicious
hours
he
spent
stretched
on
a
divan
in
that
spacious
library
in
the
house
at
passy
sometimes
idly
following
the
capricious
rings
of
smoke
from
a
turkish
cigarette

she
gave
herself
up
to
fanciful
memories
singing
the
sweet
of
her
native
land
the
serenade
from

should
take
place
in

pleasure
others
on
motives

represent

part

fact

contrary

ordinary
opinion
all
enjoyment
comes
from
the
brain
the
intensity
of
sensation
corresponding
to
the
psychic
sensibility
of
the

paris
was
for
them
not
a

glow
of
the
western
sky
her
skin
was
so
clear
so
delicate
so
ideal
that
the
light
seemed
to
penetrate
it
and
illuminate
it
from
within
her
eyes
were
misty
with
soft
languor
and
her
little
childlike
mouth
was
lightly
parted
she
seemed
lost
in
contemplation
of
the
sunset
light
leaning
on
spero
breast
her
arms
twined
about
his
neck
she
was
sinking
into
a
revery
when
a
crossed
the
sky
just
over
the
tower
she
started
with
a
little
feeling
of
superstition
the
most
brilliant
stars
were
already
sparkling
in
the
heavenly
depths
arcturus
a
brilliant
golden
yellow
was
very
high
almost
at
the
zenith
vega
a
pure
white
light
had
already
risen
towards
the
west
in
the
north
capella
in
the
west
castor
pollux
and
procyon
the
seven
stars
of
the
great
bear
regulus
spica
virginis
were
also
discernible
noiselessly
one
by
one
the
stars
came
out
to
punctuate
the
heavens
the
north
star
showed
the
only
motionless
spot
in
the
celestial
sphere
the
moon
was
rising
its
reddish
disk
somewhat
diminished
from
being
on
the
wane
mars
was
shining
between
pollux
and
regulus
in
the
southwest
saturn
in
the
southeast
twilight
was
slowly
yielding
its
place
to
the
mysterious
reign
of
night
does
it
not
seem
to
you
she
asked
that
all
these
stars
are
like
eyes
looking
down
at
us
celestial
eyes
like
yours
what
can
they
see
on
earth
more
beautiful
than
you
and
our
love
and
yet
she
added
yes
yet
the
world
family
society
custom
moral
laws
and
all
that
i
understand
your
thought
we
have
forgotten
all
these
things
to
obey
attraction
alone
like
the
sun
like
all
those
stars
like
the
warbling
nightingale
like
all
nature
very
soon
we
shall
give
those
social
customs
the
part
which
belongs
to
them
and
can
openly
proclaim
our
love
shall
we
be
any
happier
for
that
is
it
possible
to
be
any
happier
than
we
are
at
this
very
moment
i
am
yours
she
replied
i
do
not
exist
for
myself
i
am
swallowed
up
in
your
light
your
love
in
your
happiness
and
i
care
for
nothing
nothing
more
no
i
was
thinking
of
those
stars
of
those
eyes
looking
down
at
us
and
wondering
where
all
the
human
eyes
are
which
have
watched
them
for
millions
of
years
as
we
do
where
are
all
the
hearts
that
have
beaten
as
our
heart
beats
now
where
are
all
the
souls
who
have
lost
themselves
in
endless
kisses
in
the
mysterious
vanished
nights
they
all
exist
nothing
can
be
destroyed
we
associate
heaven
and
earth
and
we
are
right
in
all
the
ages
with
all
peoples
among
all
beliefs
mankind
has
always
asked
the
secret
of
its
destiny
of
the
starry
heavens
that
was
one
kind
of
divination
the
earth
is
a
star
of
heaven
like
mars
and
saturn
which
we
see
yonder
earths
of
the
sky
lighted
by
the
same
sun
as
we
are
and
like
all
these
stars
which
are
distant
suns
thought
translates
what
man
has
believed
ever
since
it
existed
all
eyes
have
sought
the
answer
to
the
great
enigma
in
the
skies
and
urania
has
replied
to
them
since
the
early
days
of
mythology
the
night
was
coming
on
the
moon
slowly
rising
in
the
eastern
sky
was
shedding
her
radiance
through
the
atmosphere
insensibly
displacing
the
twilight
and
in
the
city
at
their
feet
below
the
thickets
and
ruins
a
few
lights
were
already
beginning
to
appear
here
and
there
the
two
had
risen
and
were
standing
in
the
centre
of
the
tower
roof
closely
clasped
together
she
was
beautiful
framed
in
the
aureole
of
her
hair
whose
curls
floated
over
her
shoulders
little
puffs
of
air
fragrant
with
perfume
of
violets
gillyflowers
lilacs
and
may
roses
were
rising
from
the
neighboring
gardens
solitude
and
silence
were
about
them
their
lips
united
in
a
long
kiss
the
hundredth
at
least
of
that
beautiful
day
of
spring
she
was
still
dreaming
a
fugitive
smile
suddenly
lighted
up
her
face
then
faded
away
like
a
passing
cloud
of
what
are
you
thinking
he
asked
oh
nothing
a
worldly
foolish
thought
a
little
silly
nothing
but
what
was
it
he
asked
taking
her
again
in
his
arms
oh
i
was
only
wondering
if
people
had
mouths
in
those
other
worlds
because
you
know
a
kiss
lips
and
so
the
hours
passed
away
days
weeks
months
in
a
perfect
union
of
all
their
thoughts
all
their
feelings
and
impressions
the
june
sun
was
already
shining
at
its
solstice
and
the
time
to
leave
for
home
had
come
at
the
appointed
time
she
left
with
her
father
for
christiania
and
spero
followed
them
a
few
days
later
it
was
the
young
savant
intention
to
stay
in
norway
until
autumn
and
continue
the
studies
on
the
aurora
borealis
he
had
begun
the
year
before
observations
which
were
especially
interesting
to
him
and
which
he
had
had
scarcely
time
to
begin
illustration
this
visit
to
norway
was
the
prolongation
of
a
happy
dream
the
fair
northern
girl
cast
an
aureole
of
perpetual
winsomeness
about
him
which
would
perhaps
have
made
him
still
forget
the
attractions
of
science
if
she
herself
had
not
had
as
we
have
seen
an
insatiable
taste
for
study
the
experiments
which
the
indefatigable
seeker
had
undertaken
on
atmospheric
electricity
interested
her
as
much
as
they
did
him
she
too
wanted
to
know
about
those
mysterious
flames
in
the
aurora
borealis
which
palpitate
at
night
in
high
atmospheres
and
as
his
series
of
investigations
led
him
to
desire
a
balloon
ascension
in
order
to
reach
and
surprise
the
phenomenon
at
its
source
she
also
experienced
the
same
wish
he
tried
to
dissuade
her
from
it
those
aeronautic
expeditions
not
being
free
from
danger
but
the
very
idea
of
sharing
a
peril
with
him
would
have
been
enough
to
make
her
deaf
to
her
loved
one
entreaties
after
long
hesitation
spero
decided
to
take
her
with
him
and
prepared
for
an
ascension
from
the
university
of
christiania
on
the
first
night
of
the
aurora
borealis
illustration
the
aurora
borealis
the
disturbances
of
the
magnetic
needle
had
announced
the
presence
even
before
the
sun
went
down
and
the
inflation
of
the
balloon
with
pure
hydrogen
gas
was
begun
while
the
sky
showed
in
the
magnetic
north
that
coloring
of
golden
green
which
is
always
the
sure
indication
of
an
aurora
borealis
the
preparations
were
ended
in
a
couple
of
hours
the
atmosphere
entirely
free
from
all
clouds
was
perfectly
limpid
the
stars
twinkled
in
the
bosom
of
a
sky
profoundly
dark
and
without
a
moon
but
towards
the
north
a
soft
light
shone
in
an
arc
above
a
black
segment
throwing
into
the
upper
atmosphere
slight
flushes
of
a
pale
greenish
rose
color
symbolizing
the
palpitations
of
an
unknown
life
iclÃ©a
father
who
was
watching
the
inflation
of
the
balloon
had
no
suspicion
that
his
daughter
was
going
but
at
the
last
moment
she
stepped
into
the
car
as
if
to
inspect
it
spero
gave
the
signal
and
the
balloon
rose
slowly
majestically
over
the
city
of
christiania
which
lighted
by
thousands
of
lamps
appeared
under
the
eyes
of
the
travellers
rising
through
the
air
to
diminish
in
size
as
it
disappeared
in
the
darkness
illustration
soon
the
balloon
taking
an
oblique
ascent
hovered
over
the
darkened
landscape
and
the
paling
lights
also
disappeared
the
noises
of
the
city
died
away
at
the
same
time
into
profound
silence
it
was
the
silence
of
the
upper
heights
which
enveloped
the
now
iclÃ©a
was
impressed
by
this
extraordinary
stillness
perhaps
above
all
by
the
novelty
of
the
situation
and
clung
to
her
rash
lover
side
they
mounted
rapidly
the
aurora
borealis
appeared
to
descend
and
spread
itself
out
under
the
stars
like
an
undulating
drapery
of
fleecy
gold
and
purple
overrun
with
electric
flashes
spero
watched
his
instruments
and
by
the
help
of
a
little
crystal
globe
filled
with
wrote
down
the
indications
corresponding
to
the
heights
attained
the
balloon
went
up
steadily
what
a
delight
to
the
investigator
in
a
few
moments
he
would
soar
to
the
crest
of
the
aurora
borealis
he
would
find
an
answer
to
the
question
about
the
height
which
had
been
asked
in
vain
by
so
many
philosophers
and
especially
by
his
beloved
masters
the
two
great
psychologists
and
philosophers
oersted
and
ampÃ¨re
iclÃ©a
emotion
had
calmed
itself
were
you
afraid
asked
her
lover
the
balloon
is
safe
you
need
fear
no
accident
everything
has
been
provided
for
we
will
go
down
in
an
hour
there
is
not
a
breath
of
wind
stirring
on
the
earth
no
she
said
while
the
celestial
light
threw
over
her
a
roseate
and
transparent
illumination
but
it
is
so
strange
so
beautiful
so
divine
it
is
grand
for
little
me
i
shuddered
for
a
moment
it
seems
to
me
that
i
love
you
more
than
ever
and
throwing
her
arms
about
his
neck
she
kissed
him
in
a
long
passionate
clinging
embrace
the
solitary
balloon
was
moving
silently
through
the
aerial
heights
a
spheroid
of
transparent
gas
enclosed
in
its
silken
envelope
whose
vertical
gores
joining
each
other
at
the
valve
on
the
top
could
be
seen
from
the
car
the
lower
part
of
the
balloon
being
open
for
the
dilation
of
the
gas
the
dusky
brightness
that
falls
from
the
stars
of
which
corneille
speaks
would
have
been
sufficient
without
the
gleams
from
the
aurora
borealis
to
enable
them
to
distinguish
the
whole
of
the
aerial
skiff
the
car
was
hung
to
the
net
which
enveloped
the
silken
vessel
by
strong
ropes
tied
to
the
and
interlaced
under
the
feet
of
the
aeronauts
the
silence
was
impressively
solemn
the
beating
of
their
hearts
could
have
been
heard
they
were
sailing
at
a
height
of
five
thousand
metres
with
an
unaccustomed
gravity
the
upper
wind
was
carrying
them
along
without
the
faintest
breath
being
felt
in
the
car
for
the
balloon
floated
in
the
moving
air
like
a
simple
bubble
motionless
except
as
the
current
carried
it
along
our
travellers
sole
inhabitants
of
these
lofty
regions
in
full
enjoyment
of
the
exquisite
elation
which
aeronauts
know
when
once
they
have
breathed
that
rare
and
sublimated
atmosphere
looked
down
upon
the
realms
below
forgetful
of
all
earthly
cares
and
associations
in
the
silence
of
their
vast
isolation
but
they
appreciated
and
enjoyed
their
unique
situation
more
than
any
of
those
who
had
preceded
them
for
they
added
to
the
pleasures
of
an
aerial
voyage
the
rapture
of
their
own
happiness
they
spoke
in
low
tones
as
if
afraid
of
being
overheard
by
the
angels
and
of
seeing
the
magic
charm
dissolved
which
held
them
so
near
to
heaven
sometimes
sudden
flashes
came
to
them
gleams
from
the
aurora
borealis
then
darkness
deeper
and
more
unfathomable
than
before
reigned
again
they
were
floating
thus
in
their
starry
dream
when
a
quick
shrill
noise
like
that
of
a
new
whistle
sounded
in
their
ears
they
listened
leaned
far
out
over
the
car
and
listened
again
the
noise
did
not
come
from
the
earth
was
it
an
electrical
blast
from
the
aurora
borealis
was
it
the
hiss
of
some
magnetic
storm
in
the
upper
air
lightning
coming
from
the
depths
of
space
flashed
about
them
and
disappeared
they
listened
breathlessly
again
the
sound
was
quite
close
to
them
it
was
the
gas
escaping
from
the
balloon
either
the
valve
had
partly
opened
of
itself
or
they
had
pressed
upon
the
connecting
rope
while
incautiously
moving
about
in
the
car
at
all
events
the
gas
was
escaping
spero
at
once
detected
the
cause
of
the
disquieting
noise
and
it
terrified
him
for
it
was
impossible
to
close
the
valve
again
he
examined
the
barometer
which
had
begun
slowly
to
rise
while
the
balloon
was
beginning
to
descend
the
fall
slow
at
first
but
inevitable
would
increase
in
mathematical
proportion
trying
to
fathom
the
abyss
below
them
he
saw
the
flames
of
the
aurora
borealis
reflected
in
the
water
of
an
immense
lake
the
balloon
was
now
descending
with
great
rapidity
and
was
not
more
than
three
thousand
metres
from
the
ground
outwardly
calm
but
fully
conscious
of
the
certain
and
impending
peril
the
unfortunate
aeronaut
threw
out
one
after
the
other
the
two
sacks
left
for
ballast
then
the
maps
the
instruments
the
anchor
and
emptied
the
car
but
this
lightening
of
the
weight
was
not
enough
and
served
only
to
slacken
momentarily
their
accelerated
speed
the
balloon
was
now
descending
or
rather
falling
at
a
tremendous
rate
and
was
but
a
few
hundred
metres
above
the
lake
strong
blew
up
and
down
and
whistled
in
their
ears
illustration
the
balloon
twisted
about
itself
as
if
whirled
by
a
waterspout
george
spero
felt
a
sudden
and
passionate
embrace
followed
by
a
long
kiss
upon
his
lips
my
master
my
god
my
all
i
love
you
she
cried
and
thrusting
aside
two
of
the
ropes
she
leaped
into
the
empty
air
the
unballasted
balloon
shot
up
again
like
an
arrow
spero
was
saved
iclÃ©a
body
made
a
dull
strange
and
frightful
sound
in
the
midnight
stillness
as
it
fell
into
the
deep
waters
of
the
lake
wild
with
grief
and
despair
spero
felt
his
hair
bristling
with
horror
he
opened
his
eyes
wide
but
saw
nothing
carried
up
by
the
balloon
to
a
height
of
more
than
a
thousand
metres
he
clung
to
the
hoping
to
fall
again
towards
the
scene
of
iclÃ©a
catastrophe
but
the
rope
would
not
work
he
fumbled
and
hunted
but
without
avail
in
the
midst
of
all
he
felt
under
his
hand
his
loved
one
veil
where
it
had
caught
on
one
of
the
ropes
a
thin
little
veil
still
fresh
with
perfume
and
filled
with
the
memories
of
his
lovely
companion
he
stared
at
the
ropes
thinking
he
could
find
the
imprint
of
her
little
clinging
hands
and
putting
his
own
where
iclÃ©a
had
been
an
instant
before
he
threw
himself
out
of
the
car
his
foot
caught
in
a
rope
for
a
second
but
he
had
strength
enough
to
disengage
it
and
fell
whirling
into
space
the
crew
of
a
that
had
witnessed
the
closing
scenes
of
the
drama
crowded
all
sail
towards
the
spot
in
the
lake
into
which
the
young
girl
had
fallen
and
succeeded
in
finding
and
rescuing
her
she
was
not
dead
but
all
the
care
lavished
upon
her
could
not
prevent
a
fever
from
setting
in
and
making
her
its
prey
in
the
morning
the
fishermen
reached
a
little
harbor
on
the
borders
of
the
lake
and
carried
her
to
their
humble
cot
but
she
did
not
regain
consciousness

cried

her

that
was
all

his

mangled
condition
a
short

from

his
fall
was
more
than
a
thousand
metres
it
had
begun
over
the
lake
but
the
body
retaining
the
horizontal
impetus
given
by
the
moving
balloon
had
not
fallen
vertically
it
had
descended
obliquely
as
if
slipping
down
a
rope
following
the
course
of
the
balloon
and
like
a
mass
thrown
from
the
sky
had
fallen
into
a
meadow
near
the
shore
of
the
lake
making
a
deep
indentation
in
the
soil
and
rebounding
more
than
a
metre
from

place
where
it
fell
his
very
bones
were
crushed
into
powder

brain
protruded
through

hardly
been
closed

on
the
others
the
earth
has
already
run
its
yearly
course
around
the
sun
twenty
times
since
destiny
so
tragically
closed
the
book
that
my
young
friends
had
been
reading
for
less
than
a
year
their
happiness
was
their
morning
faded
away
like
the
dawn
i
had
forgotten
or
at
least
lost
sight
of
them
when
quite
recently
at
a
hypnotic
sÃ©ance
in
nancy
where
i
had
stopped
for
a
few
days
on
my
way
to
the
vosges
i
was
induced
to
question
a
subject
by
whose
assistance
the
experimental
savants
of
the
acadÃ©mie
stanislas
had
obtained
some
of
those
really
startling
results
with
which
the
scientific
press
has
surprised
us
for
a
few
years
past
i
do
not
remember
how
but
it
happened
that
my
conversation
with
him
turned
on
the
planet
mars
after
describing
to
me
a
country
situated
on
the
shores
of
a
sea
known
to
astronomers
under
the
name
of
kepler
ocean
and
a
solitary
island
lying
in
the
bosom
of
this
sea
after
telling
me
about
the
picturesque
landscapes
and
reddish
vegetation
which
adorned
the
shores
the
cliffs
and
the
sandy
beaches
where
the
billows
break
and
die
away
the
subject
who
was
very
sensitive
suddenly
grew
pale
and
raised
his
hand
to
his
head
his
eyes
closed
his
eyebrows
contracted
he
seemed
desirous
of
grasping
some
fugitive
idea
which
obstinately
eluded
him
said
standing
before
him
with
irresistible
command
see
i
wish
it
you
have
friends
there
he
said
to
me
i
am
not
surprised
at
that
i
said
laughing
i
have
done
enough
to
deserve
them
two
friends
he
went
on
who
are
talking
about
you
now
this
very
minute
ah
ha
persons
who
know
me
yes
how
is
that
they
have
known
you
here
here
here
on
the
earth
how
long
ago
was
it
i
do
not
know
have
they
lived
on
mars
long
i
do
not
know
are
they
young
yes
they
are
lovers
who
adore
each
other
then
the
loved
image
of
my
lamented
friends
rose
distinctly
in
my
mind
but
i
had
no
sooner
seen
them
than
the
subject
exclaimed
yes
it
is
they
how
do
you
know
i
see
they
are
the
same
souls
same
colors
what
do
you
mean
by
the
colors
yes
the
souls
are
suffused
with
light
a
few
instants
afterwards
he
added
and
yet
there
is
a
difference
then
he
was
silent
his
forehead
frowning
in
his
effort
to
find
out
but
his
face
regained
all
its
calmness
and
serenity
as
he
added
he
has
become
she
the
woman
she
is
now
the
man
and
they
love
each
other
more
than
ever
as
if
he
did
not
quite
understand
what
he
had
said
himself
he
seemed
to
be
seeking
for
some
explanation
made
painful
efforts
judging
from
the
contraction
of
the
muscles
in
his
face
and
fell
into
a
sort
of
cataleptic
fit
from
which
speedily
relieved
him
but
the
lucid
interval
had
fled
not
to
return
in
ending
i
leave
this
last
fact
with
the
reader
just
as
it
happened
without
comment
had
the
subject
according
to
the
hypothesis
now
admitted
by
many
hypnotists
been
under
the
influence
of
my
own
thought
when
the
professor
ordered
him
to
answer
me
or
being
independent
had
he
really
freed
himself
and
had
he
beyond
our
sphere
i
can
not
undertake
to
decide
perhaps
it
will
appear
in
the
course
of
this
story
and
yet
i
will
acknowledge
in
all
sincerity
that
the
resurrection
of
my
friend
and
his
adored
companion
on
the
world
of
mars
a
neighboring
abode
to
ours
and
so
remarkably
like
this
one
we
inhabit
only
older
doubtless
more
advanced
on
the
road
of
progress
may
appear
to
a
thinker
eyes
the
logical
and
natural
continuation
of
their
earthly
existence
so
quickly
broken
off
doubtless
spero
was
right
in
declaring
that
matter
is
not
what
it
seems
to
be
and
that
appearances
are
deceitful
that
the
real
is
the
invisible
that
animate
force
is
indestructible
that
in
the
absolute
the
infinitely
great
is
identical
with
the
infinitely
small
that
celestial
space
is
not
impassable
and
that
souls
are
the
seeds
of
planetary
humanities
who
knows
but
that
the
philosophy
of
dynamism
may
one
day
reveal
the
religion
of
the
future
to
the
apostles
of
astronomy
does
not
urania
bear
the
torch
without
which
every
problem
is
insoluble
without
which
all
nature

remain

us

us
to
form
something

telepathy
the
magnetic
sÃ©ance
at
nancy
had
left
a
strong
impression
on
my
mind
i
often
thought
of
my
departed
friend
and
his
investigations
in
the
unexplored
domains
of
nature
and
life
of
his
sincere
and
original
analytical
researches
on
the
mysterious
problem
of
immortality
but
i
could
not
think
of
him
now
without
associating
him
with
the
idea
of
a
possible
reincarnation
in
the
planet
mars
this
idea
seemed
to
me
to
be
bold
rash
purely
imaginary
if
you
like
but
not
absurd
the
distance
from
here
to
mars
is
equal
to
zero
for
the
transmission
of
attraction
it
is
almost
insignificant
for
that
of
light
since
a
few
minutes
are
enough
for
a
luminous
undulation
to
travel
millions
of
leagues
i
thought
of
the
telegraph
the
telephone
and
the
phonograph
of
the
influence
a
hypnotizer
will
has
on
his
subject
many
kilometres
distant
and
i
wondered
if
some
marvellous
advance
in
science
might
not
suddenly
throw
a
celestial
bridge
between
our
world
and
others
of
its
kind
in
infinity
for
several
evenings
i
could
not
observe
mars
through
the
telescope
without
my
attention
being
diverted
by
many
strange
fancies
still
the
planet
was
very
beautiful
as
it
was
during
all
the
spring
of
extensive
inundations
had
taken
place
upon
one
of
its
continents
upon
libye
as
astronomers
had
observed
before
in
and
under
various
circumstances
it
was
discovered
that
its
meteorology
and
climatology
are
not
the
same
as
ours
and
that
the
waters
which
cover
about
half
of
the
planet
surface
are
subject
to
strange
displacements
and
periodical
variations
of
which
terrestrial
geography
can
give
no
idea
the
snow
at
the
boreal
pole
had
greatly
diminished
which
proves
that
the
summer
on
that
hemisphere
had
been
quite
hot
although
less
elevated
than
that
of
the
southern
hemisphere
besides
there
had
been
very
few
clouds
over
mars
during
the
whole
series
of
our
observations
but
it
will
be
hardly
credible
that
it
was
not
these
astronomical
facts
however
important
they
might
be
and
the
base
of
all
our
conjectures
which
most
interested
me
it
was
what
the
hypnotized
man
had
told
me
of
george
and
iclÃ©a
the
fantastic
ideas
flitting
through
my
brain
prevented
me
from
making
a
truly
scientific
observation
i
persistently
wondered
if
communication
could
not
exist
between
two
beings
very
far
removed
from
each
other
and
even
between
the
living
and
the
dead
and
each
time
i
told
myself
that
such
a
question
was
of
itself
unscientific
and
showed
a
positive
spirit
illustration
yet
after
all
what
is
what
we
call
science
what
is
not
scientific
in
nature
where
are
the
limits
of
positive
study
is
the
carcase
of
a
bird
really
a
more
scientific
thing
than
its
lustrous
colored
plumage
and
its
song
with
its
subtle
tones
is
the
skeleton
of
a
pretty
woman
more
worthy
of
admiration
than
her
structure
of
flesh
and
her
living
form
is
not
the
analysis
of
the
mind
emotions
scientific
is
it
not
scientific
to
try
to
find
out
whether
the
mind
can
see
to
a
distance
and
in
what
manner
and
then
how
much
reason
is
there
in
this
strange
vanity
that
we
imagine
that
science
has
told
us
all
that
we
know
all
there
is
to
know
that
our
five
senses
are
sufficient
to
appreciate
the
nature
of
the
universe
from
what
we
can
make
out
among
the
forces
acting
about
us
attraction
heat
light
electricity
does
it
follow
that
there
may
not
be
other
forces
which
escape
us
because
we
have
no
senses
to
perceive
them
it
is
not
this
hypothesis
which
is
absurd
it
is
the
simplicity
of
pedants
we
smile
at
the
ideas
of
the
astronomers
philosophers
physicians
and
theologians
of
three
centuries
ago
three
centuries
hence
will
not
our
successors
laugh
in
their
turn
at
the
affirmations
of
those
who
pretend
to
know
everything
now
the
physicians
to
whom
fifteen
years
ago
i
communicated
some
magnetic
phenomena
observed
by
myself
during
some
experiments
all
confidently
denied
the
reality
of
the
facts
i
met
one
of
them
recently
at
the
institute
oh
said
he
not
without
a
certain
wit
then
it
was
magnetism
now
it
is
hypnotism
and
we
are
studying
it
moral
do
not
deny
anything
as
a
foregone
conclusion
let
us
study
and
discover
the
explanation
will
come
later
illustration
i
was
in
this
frame
of
mind
pacing
up
and
down
my
library
when
my
eyes
chanced
to
fall
on
a
pretty
copy
of
cicero
which
i
had
not
noticed
for
some
time
i
took
up
a
volume
of
it
opened
it
mechanically
at
the
first
page
i
came
to
and
read
the
following
two
friends
arrive
at
megara
and
take
separate
lodgings
one
of
them
has
hardly
fallen
asleep
before
he
sees
his
travelling
companion
beside
him
telling
him
sorrowfully
that
his
host
has
formed
a
plan
to
assassinate
him
and
begging
him
to
come
to
his
assistance
as
quickly
as
possible
the
other
awakes
but
satisfied
that
he
has
had
a
bad
dream
loses
no
time
in
going
to
sleep
again
his
friend
appears
to
him
again
and
conjures
him
to
hasten
because
the
murderers
are
coming
to
his
room
more
puzzled
he
is
astonished
at
the
persistency
of
this
dream
and
is
on
the
point
of
going
to
his
friend
but
reason
and
fatigue
triumph
and
he
goes
to
bed
again
then
his
friend
comes
to
him
for
the
third
time
pale
bleeding
disfigured
said
he
to
him
did
not
come
when
i
implored
you
it
is
all
over
now
avenge
me
at
sunrise
you
will
meet
a
cart
loaded
with
manure
at
the
city
gate
stop
it
and
order
it
to
be
unloaded
you
will
find
my
body
hidden
in
the
middle
give
me
an
honest
burial
and
pursue
my
murderers
so
great
a
tenacity
such
minute
details
admitted
of
no
further
delay
or
hesitation
the
friend
rises
hurries
to
the
gate
mentioned
finds
the
wagon
there
stops
the
driver
who
is
frightened
and
soon
after
the
search
begins
the
body
of
his
friend
is
found
illustration
this
story
seemed
to
come
expressly
to
strengthen
my
opinion
in
regard
to
the
unknown
quantities
in
the
scientific
problem
doubtless
hypotheses
are
not
lacking
in
reply
to
the
point
in
question
it
may
be
said
that
perhaps
the
circumstance
never
happened
as
cicero
tells
it
that
it
has
been
amplified
and
exaggerated
that
two
friends
coming
to
a
strange
city
may
fear
an
accident
that
fearing
for
a
friend
life
after
the
fatigue
of
a
journey
in
the
middle
of
the
quiet
night
one
might
chance
to
dream
that
he
is
the
victim
of
an
assassin
as
to
the
episode
of
the
cart
the
travellers
may
have
seen
one
standing
in
their
host
and
the
principle
of
the
association
of
ideas
comes
in
to
bring
it
into
the
dream
yes
these
explanatory
hypotheses
may
be
made
but
they
are
only
hypotheses
to
admit
that
there
had
really
been
any
communication
between
the
dead
man
and
the
living
one
is
also
an
hypothesis
are
facts
of
this
kind
very
rare
it
seems
not
i
remember
among
others
a
story
told
me
by
an
old
friend
of
my
boyish
days
jean
best
who
with
my
eminent
friend
Ã©douard
charton
founded
the
in
and
died
a
few
years
ago
he
was
a
grave
cold
methodical
man
a
skilful
typographical
engraver
and
a
careful
business
man
every
one
who
knew
him
knows
how
little
nervous
he
was
by
temperament
and
how
foreign
to
his
mind
were
things
of
the
imagination
well
the
following
incident
happened
to
him
when
he
was
a
child
between
five
and
six
years
old
illustration
it
was
at
toul
his
native
place
he
was
lying
in
his
little
bed
one
beautiful
evening
but
was
not
asleep
when
he
saw
his
mother
come
into
his
chamber
cross
it
and
go
into
the
adjoining
whose
door
was
open
and
where
his
father
was
playing
cards
with
a
friend
now
his
mother
was
ill
at
pau
at
that
time
he
at
once
rose
from
his
bed
and
ran
to
the
after
his
mother
where
he
looked
for
her
in
vain
his
father
scolded
him
somewhat
impatiently
and
sent
him
back
to
bed
again
assuring
him
that
he
had
been
dreaming
then
the
child
thinking
that
he
must
have
been
dreaming
tried
to
go
to
sleep
again
but
some
time
afterwards
lying
with
his
eyes
open
he
distinctly
saw
his
mother
pass
him
for
the
second
time
only
now
he
hurried
to
her
and
kissed
her
and
she
at
once
disappeared
he
did
not
want
to
go
to
bed
afterwards
and
remained
in
the
where
his
father
continued
to
play
cards
his
mother
died
at
pau
the
same
day
at
that
very
hour
i
have
this
circumstance
from
best
himself
who
remembered
it
clearly
how
explain
it
it
may
be
said
that
knowing
his
mother
was
ill
the
child
often
thought
of
her
and
had
an
hallucination
which
happened
to
coincide
with
his
mother
death
that
is
possible
but
it
may
be
thought
too
that
there
was
some
sympathetic
link
between
the
mother
and
child
and
at
that
solemn
moment
the
mother
soul
may
really
have
been
in
communication
with
her
child
how
one
may
ask
we
know
nothing
about
it
but
what
we
do
not
know
is
to
what
we
know
in
the
proportion
of
the
ocean
to
a
drop
of
water
that
is
easily
said
how
many
medical
works
have
been
written
upon
this
subject
everybody
knows
that
of
brierre
de
boismont
among
the
numberless
incidents
which
it
relates
let
us
cite
the
two
following
observation
when
king
james
came
to
england
at
the
time
of
the
london
plague
being
at
sir
robert
cotton
house
in
the
country
with
old
camden
he
saw
in
a
dream
his
oldest
son
who
was
still
a
child
living
in
london
with
a
bleeding
cross
on
his
forehead
as
if
he
had
been
wounded
by
a
sword
frightened
at
this
apparition
the
king
began
to
pray
in
the
morning
he
went
to
camden
chamber
and
told
him
the
events
of
the
night
the
latter
reassured
the
monarch
telling
him
he
had
nothing
to
torment
himself
about
that
very
day
the
king
received
a
letter
from
his
wife
announcing
the
death
of
his
son
who
had
died
from
the
plague
when
the
child
appeared
to
his
father
he
had
the
height
and
proportions
of
a
grown
man
observation
mlle
a
person
of
excellent
judgment
religious
but
not
a
bigot
lived
before
her
marriage
at
her
uncle
house
the
celebrated
physician
and
a
member
of
the
institute
she
was
away
from
her
mother
who
was
attacked
by
violent
illness
in
the
country
one
night
this
young
person
dreamed
that
she
saw
her
pale
disfigured
very
near
death
and
showing
deep
grief
at
not
having
her
children
with
her
one
of
whom
the
curate
of
a
parish
in
paris
had
emigrated
to
spain
the
other
being
in
paris
soon
she
heard
herself
called
by
her
christian
name
several
times
in
her
dream
she
saw
the
persons
who
were
with
her
mother
thinking
she
called
her
little
granddaughter
who
had
the
same
name
go
into
the
next
room
for
her
when
a
sign
from
the
sick
woman
told
them
it
was
not
she
but
her
daughter
who
lived
in
paris
whom
she
wanted
to
see
her
face
showed
the
grief
she
felt
at
the
daughter
absence
suddenly
her
features
changed
the
paleness
of
death
spread
over
her
face
and
she
fell
back
lifeless
on
her
bed
the
next
morning
mlle
seemed
very
sad
to
who
begged
to
know
the
cause
of
her
grief
she
told
him
all
the
particulars
of
the
dream
which
had
so
greatly
distressed
her
finding
her
in
that
frame
of
mind
pressed
her
to
his
heart
acknowledging
that
the
news
was
only
too
true
that
her
mother
had
just
died
he
did
not
enter
into
further
particulars
a
few
months
afterwards
mlle
profiting
by
her
absence
to
put
in
order
his
papers
which
like
many
other
savants
he
disliked
to
have
touched
found
a
letter
to
her
uncle
relating
the
circumstances
of
her
mother
death
what
was
her
surprise
to
read
all
the
particulars
of
her
dream
hallucination
fortuitous
coincidence
is
that
a
satisfactory
explanation
at
all
events
it
is
an
explanation
which
explains
nothing
at
all
a
host
of
ignorant
persons
of
all
ages
and
trades
clerks
merchants
or
deputies
sceptics
by
temperament
or
habit
simply
declare
that
they
do
not
believe
these
stories
that
there
is
nothing
true
about
them
that
also
is
not
a
very
good
solution
of
them
minds
accustomed
to
study
can
not
content
themselves
with
so
trifling
a
denial
a
fact
is
a
fact
we
can
not
refuse
to
admit
it
even
when
we
can
not
in
the
present
state
of
our
knowledge
explain
it
of
course
medical
annals
acknowledge
that
there
is
really
more
than
one
kind
of
hallucination
and
that
certain
nervous
organizations
are
their
dupes
but
there
is
a
wide
gulf
between
that
and
concluding
that
all
phenomena
are
hallucinations
the
scientific
spirit
of
our
century
rightly
seeks
to
free
all
these
facts
from
the
deceptive
fogs
of
supernaturalism
inasmuch
as
nothing
is
supernatural
and
nature
whose
kingdom
is
infinite
embraces
everything
during
the
last
few
years
a
special
scientific
society
has
been
organized
in
england
for
the
study
of
these
phenomena
the
society
for
psychical
research
it
has
at
its
head
some
of
the
most
illustrious
savants
on
the
other
side
of
the
channel
and
has
already
sent
out
important
publications
these
phenomena
of
sight
at
a
distance
are
classed
under
the
general
title
of
telepathy
ÏÎ®Î»Îµ
ÏÎ¬Î¸Î¿Ï
rigorous
inquiries
are
made
to
verify
their
testimony
its
variety
is
very
great
let
us
look
through
one
of
these
collections
together
for
a
moment
and
take
out
a
few
of
the
documents
which
are
duly
and
scientifically
established
in
the
following
recently
observed
case
the
observer
was
as
wide
awake
as
you
and
i
are
at
this
moment
it
is
about
a
certain
robert
bee
who
lives
at
wigan
england
here
is
the
curious
revelation
written
by
the
observer
himself
on
the
of
december
my
wife
and
i
went
to
visit
my
wife
family
at
southport
leaving
my
parents
to
all
appearance
in
perfect
health
the
next
afternoon
we
were
strolling
on
the
beach
when
i
became
so
depressed
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
interest
myself
in
anything
whatever
so
that
we
soon
returned
to
the
house
all
at
once
my
wife
showed
signs
of
great
uneasiness
and
said
she
was
going
to
her
mother
room
for
a
few
moments
a
minute
afterwards
i
rose
from
my
armchair
and
went
into
the
a
lady
in
walking
costume
came
towards
me
from
an
adjacent
i
did
not
notice
her
features
because
her
face
was
turned
away
from
me
still
i
spoke
to
her
and
greeted
her
at
once
but
i
do
not
remember
now
what
i
said
at
the
same
time
while
she
was
passing
before
me
my
wife
was
coming
from
her
mother
chamber
and
walked
right
over
the
place
where
i
saw
the
lady
without
seeming
to
notice
her
i
said
at
once
in
great
surprise
is
that
lady
whom
you
just
met
met
no
one
replied
my
wife
still
more
astonished
than
i
was
i
replied
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
did
not
see
a
lady
this
very
minute
who
passed
by
just
where
you
are
now
she
probably
came
from
your
mother
room
and
must
be
now
in
the
vestibule
is
impossible
she
said
is
positively
no
one
in
the
house
at
this
moment
but
my
mother
and
ourselves
sure
enough
no
strange
lady
had
been
there
and
the
search
which
we
immediately
began
was
without
result
it
was
then
ten
minutes
to
eight
the
next
morning
a
telegram
informed
us
of
my
mother
sudden
death
from
at
exactly
that
hour
she
was
then
in
the
street
and
dressed
precisely
like
the
unknown
lady
who
had
passed
in
front
of
me
such
is
the
observer
story
the
inquiries
made
by
the
society
for
psychical
research
have
proved
its
absolute
authenticity
and
the
agreement
of
the
witnesses
it
is
as
positive
a
fact
as
a
meteorological
astronomical
philosophical
or
chemical
observation
how
can
it
be
explained
coincidence
you
will
say
can
a
strict
scientific
criticism
be
satisfied
with
this
word
still
another
case
frederick
wingfield
living
at
en
terre
writes
that
on
the
of
march
having
gone
to
bed
rather
late
after
reading
a
part
of
the
evening
he
dreamed
that
his
brother
living
in
the
county
of
essex
in
england
was
with
him
but
instead
of
answering
a
question
asked
him
merely
shook
his
head
rose
from
his
chair
and
went
away
the
impression
was
so
strong
that
the
narrator
sprang
from
his
bed
half
asleep
awaking
as
his
foot
touched
the
floor
and
called
his
brother
three
days
later
he
received
news
that
his
brother
had
been
killed
by
a
fall
from
his
horse
the
same
day
march
in
the
evening
about
eight
a
few
hours
before
the
dream
just
reported
an
inquiry
proved
that
the
date
of
this
death
was
exact
and
that
the
author
of
this
narrative
had
written
his
dream
in
a
diary
at
the
very
date
of
the
event
and
not
afterwards
still
another
case
and
both
employed
in
a
government
office
had
been
intimate
friends
for
eight
years
monday
march
had
an
attack
of
indigestion
at
his
office
he
went
to
a
druggist
where
he
was
given
some
medicine
and
was
told
that
his
liver
was
affected
the
following
thursday
he
was
no
better
saturday
of
that
same
week
he
was
still
absent
from
the
office
on
saturday
evening
march
was
at
home
with
a
headache
he
told
his
wife
that
he
was
too
warm
which
he
had
not
been
before
for
two
months
then
after
making
this
remark
he
went
to
bed
and
shortly
after
he
saw
his
friend
standing
before
him
dressed
as
usual
noticed
even
this
particular
about
clothes
that
he
had
a
black
band
on
his
hat
and
that
his
coat
was
unbuttoned
he
also
had
a
cane
in
his
hand
looked
directly
at
and
passed
on
then
remembered
the
sentence
in
the
book
of
job
spirit
passed
before
my
face
the
hair
of
my
flesh
stood
up
at
that
moment
he
felt
a
chill
run
all
over
his
body
and
felt
the
hair
rise
on
his
head
then
he
asked
his
wife
time
is
it
she
replied
minutes
of
nine
asked
you
he
said
is
dead
i
have
just
seen
him
she
tried
to
persuade
him
that
it
was
a
pure
illusion
but
he
insisted
in
the
most
solemn
manner
that
nothing
could
induce
him
to
change
his
opinion
this
is
the
story
as
told
by
he
did
not
learn
of
his
death
until
three
on
sunday
had
died
on
saturday
evening
at
about
ten
minutes
of
nine

historical
account
of
an
occurrence
at
the
time
of
the
cardinal
of
lorraine
death
is
somewhat
like
this
story
the
king
being
at
avignon
on
december
charles
cardinal
of
lorraine
died
there
the
queen
catherine
de
mÃ©dicis
had
retired
to
bed
earlier
than
usual
having
at
her
among
other
persons
of
note
the
king
of
navarre
the
archbishop
of
lyons
the
ladies
de
retz
de
lignerolles
and
de
saunes
two
of
whom
have
confirmed
this
report
as
she
was
hurrying
to
finish
her
she
threw
herself
back
on
her
bed
with
a
start
put
her
hands
over
her
face
with
a
loud
cry
calling
to
those
about
her
for
help
pointing
to
the
cardinal
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
who
she
said
was
holding
out
his
hand
to
her
she
cried
out
several
times
le
cardinal
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
you
at
the
same
time
the
king
of
navarre
sent
one
of
his
gentlemen
to
the
cardinal
house
who
reported
that
he
had
died
at
that
very
minute
in
his
book
on
posthumous
humanity
published
in
adolphe
guarantees
the
authenticity
of
the
following
statement
which
was
reported
by
a
lady
of
gaudens
as
having
happened
to
herself
it
was
before
my
marriage
she
said
and
i
slept
with
my
elder
sister
one
night
we
had
just
put
out
the
light
and
gone
to
bed
the
fire
was
still
burning
enough
to
dimly
light
the
room
glancing
at
the
fireplace
to
my
great
surprise
i
saw
a
priest
seated
before
the
fire
warming
himself
he
was
a
stout
man
and
had
the
form
and
features
of
an
uncle
of
ours
a
priest
who
lived
in
the
suburbs
i
at
once
spoke
to
my
sister
the
latter
looked
at
the
fireplace
and
saw
the
same
apparition
she
also
recognized
our
uncle
the
priest
an
indescribable
fright
took
possession
of
us
and
we
both
cried
as
loud
as
we
could
my
father
who
was
sleeping
in
an
adjoining
room
aroused
by
our
cries
rose
in
great
haste
and
soon
came
in
with
a
lighted
candle
in
his
hand
the
phantom
had
disappeared
we
no
longer
saw
any
one
in
the
chamber
the
next
day
we
learned
by
letter
that
our
uncle
the
priest
had
died
the
previous
evening
illustration
another
fact
is
reported
by
the
same
disciple
of
auguste
comte
and
sent
by
him
while
living
in
rio
de
janeiro
it
was
in
in
the
french
colony
of
that
city
people
were
still
talking
about
a
singular
apparition
which
had
taken
place
there
a
few
years
before
an
alsatian
family
consisting
of
a
husband
wife
and
little
girl
still
almost
a
baby
sailed
for
rio
de
janeiro
where
they
were
to
join
some
compatriots
living
in
that
city
the
passage
was
very
long
the
wife
was
taken
ill
and
lacking
proper
care
and
nourishment
did
not
live
to
reach
there
the
day
she
died
she
fell
into
a
swoon
remained
in
that
state
for
some
time
and
when
she
recovered
her
senses
said
to
her
husband
who
was
watching
by
her
side
i
die
happy
for
now
i
am
easy
about
the
fate
of
our
child
i
have
just
come
from
rio
de
janeiro
i
found
our
friend
fritz
the
carpenter
house
and
street
he
was
standing
at
the
door
i
showed
him
our
little
girl
i
feel
sure
that
on
your
arrival
he
will
recognize
and
take
care
of
her
that
very
day
at
the
same
hour
fritz
the
alsatian
carpenter
of
whom
i
have
just
spoken
was
standing
at
the
door
of
the
house
where
he
lived
in
rio
de
janeiro
when
he
thought
he
saw
one
of
his
compatriots
going
along
the
street
with
a
little
girl
in
her
arms
she
looked
at
him
entreatingly
and
seemed
to
show
him
the
child
she
was
carrying
her
face
notwithstanding
its
emaciation
reminded
him
of
latta
the
wife
of
his
friend
and
schmidt
her
expression
the
singularity
of
her
step
which
seemed
more
like
a
vision
than
reality
struck
fritz
and
wanting
to
be
sure
that
he
was
not
the
victim
of
an
illusion
he
called
one
of
his
men
who
was
working
in
the
shop
and
who
was
also
an
alsatian
from
the
same
locality
look
said
he
do
you
not
see
a
woman
going
down
the
street
holding
a
child
in
her
arms
and
should
you
not
say
that
it
is
latta
our
friend
schmidt
wife
i
can
not
say
i
do
not
see
her
very
distinctly
replied
the
workman
fritz
said
no
more
but
the
different
circumstances
of
this
real
or
imaginary
apparition
fixed
themselves
firmly
in
his
mind
especially
the
day
and
hour
some
time
after
that
schmidt
his
compatriot
arrived
carrying
a
little
girl
in
his
arms
latta
visit
then
came
into
mind
and
before
schmidt
had
spoken
a
word
he
said
to
him
i
know
all
my
poor
friend
your
wife
died
during
the
passage
before
she
died
she
came
and
showed
me
her
little
girl
that
i
might
take
care
of
her
here
is
the
date
and
hour
it
was
really
the
day
and
hour
noted
by
schmidt
on
board
the
boat
in
his
work
on
the
phenomena
of
magic
published
in
gougenot
des
mousseaux
reports
the
following
incident
which
he
certifies
as
absolutely
authentic
sir
robert
bruce
belonging
to
the
illustrious
scotch
family
of
that
name
was
mate
of
a
vessel
one
day
when
sailing
near
newfoundland
and
while
busy
with
his
calculations
he
thought
he
saw
the
captain
seated
at
his
desk
but
looked
at
him
attentively
and
noticed
that
it
was
a
stranger
whose
cold
fixed
look
surprised
him
he
went
on
deck
the
captain
noticed
his
surprise
and
asked
him
what
it
meant
who
is
at
your
desk
asked
bruce
no
one
yes
there
is
some
one
there
is
it
a
stranger
and
how
did
he
come
there
you
are
either
dreaming
or
joking
not
at
all
come
down
and
see
for
yourself
they
go
down
to
the
cabin
but
there
is
no
one
at
the
desk
the
ship
is
thoroughly
searched
but
no
stranger
is
found
and
yet
the
man
i
saw
was
writing
on
your
slate
the
writing
must
be
there
still
said
he
to
the
captain
illustration
they
looked
at
the
slate
it
bore
these
words
steer
to
the
northwest
this
must
be
your
writing
or
some
one
else
on
board
the
ship
no
i
did
not
write
it
every
one
was
told
to
write
the
same
sentence
and
no
handwriting
resembled
that
on
the
slate
very
well
said
the
captain
we
will
obey
these
instructions
and
steer
the
ship
to
the
northwest
the
wind
is
right
and
will
admit
of
our
trying
the
experiment
illustration
three
hours
later
the
watch
perceived
an
iceberg
and
near
it
a
vessel
from
quebec
headed
for
liverpool
dismantled
and
covered
with
people
they
were
brought
off
by
boats
of
bruce
vessel
as
one
of
the
men
was
climbing
up
the
side
of
the
rescuing
vessel
bruce
started
and
drew
back
in
great
agitation
he
recognized
the
stranger
whom
he
had
seen
tracing
the
words
on
the
slate
he
reported
the
strange
incident
to
the
captain
will
you
write
to
the
northwest
on
this
slate
asked
the
captain
turning
to
the
and
offering
the
side
which
bore
no
writing
the
stranger
complied
with
his
request
and
wrote
the
desired
words
will
you
acknowledge
that
to
be
your
ordinary
handwriting
asked
the
captain
struck
with
the
similarity
of
the
two
sentences
of
course
how
can
you
doubt
it
you
saw
me
write
it
yourself
as
a
reply
the
captain
turned
the
slate
over
and
the
stranger
was
amazed
to
see
his
own
writing
on
both
sides
did
you
dream
of
writing
on
that
slate
said
the
quebec
captain
to
the
man
who
had
just
been
writing
no
at
least
i
have
no
remembrance
of
doing
so
what
was
that
passenger
doing
at
noon
asks
the
rescuer
of
his
brother
captain
the
passenger
was
very
tired
and
had
fallen
into
a
sound
sleep
as
near
as
i
remember
a
little
before
twelve
an
hour
or
more
later
he
awoke
and
said
to
me
we
shall
be
saved
this
very
day
adding
dreamed
that
i
was
on
board
a
vessel
coming
to
our
relief
he
described
the
ship
and
its
rigging
and
we
were
very
much
surprised
when
you
headed
for
us
to
recognize
the
exactness
of
the
description
after
a
while
the
passenger
said
it
is
very
strange
but
somehow
this
ship
seems
quite
familiar
to
me
and
yet
i
was
never
on
it
before
baron
dupotet
in
his
article
on
animal
magnetism
reports
the
following
fact
published
in
by
the
celebrated
jung
stiling
who
had
it
from
the
observer
himself
baron
de
sulza
chamberlain
to
the
king
of
sweden
illustration
he
was
going
home
one
night
in
summer
about
twelve
an
hour
at
which
it
is
still
light
enough
in
sweden
to
read
the
finest
print
as
i
reached
the
family
estate
he
said
my
father
came
to
the
entrance
of
the
park
to
meet
me
he
was
dressed
as
usual
and
carried
a
cane
which
my
brother
had
carved
i
greeted
him
and
we
talked
together
for
a
long
time
we
went
into
the
house
and
up
to
his
bedroom
door
together
on
going
into
the
chamber
i
saw
my
father
there
undressed
when
the
apparition
instantly
faded
away
a
little
while
afterwards
my
father
awoke
and
looked
at
me
inquiringly
dear
edward
said
he
be
praised
that
i
see
you
safe
and
well
i
was
greatly
distressed
about
you
in
my
dream
i
thought
that
you
had
fallen
into
the
water
and
were
in
danger
of
drowning
now
on
that
very
day
added
the
baron
i
had
been
on
the
river
with
some
friends
and
had
come
very
near
being
dragged
down
by
the
current
i
told
my
father
that
i
had
seen
his
double
at
the
park
gate
and
that
we
had
had
a
long
talk
together
he
told
me
that
he
had
often
had
similar
experiences
illustration
in
these
various
stories
are
seen
spontaneous
apparitions
and
appearances
which
were
provoked
so
to
speak
by
the
will
can
mental
suggestion
go
so
far
as
that
the
authors
of
the
book
mentioned
above
phantasms
of
the
living
reply
affirmatively
by
seven
examples
of
which
i
will
present
one
to
the
attention
of
my
readers
here
it
is
the
rev
godfrey
living
in
eastbourne
in
the
county
of
sussex
having
read
an
account
of
a
premeditated
apparition
was
so
struck
thereby
that
he
determined
to
attempt
it
himself
on
the
fifteenth
of
november
about
eleven
he
concentrated
the
whole
power
of
his
imagination
and
all
the
strength
of
will
of
which
he
was
master
upon
the
idea
of
appearing
to
a
lady
a
friend
of
his
by
standing
at
the
foot
of
her
bed
the
effort
lasted
about
eight
minutes
after
which
godfrey
felt
very
much
fatigued
and
went
to
sleep
the
next
day
the
lady
who
had
been
the
subject
of
the
experiment
came
of
her
own
accord
to
tell
godfrey
of
what
she
had
seen
when
asked
to
make
a
memorandum
she
did
so
in
these
words
night
i
awoke
with
a
start
feeling
that
some
one
had
entered
my
room
i
heard
too
a
noise
which
i
supposed
to
be
the
birds
in
the
ivy
outside
my
window
i
then
experienced
a
sort
of
uneasiness
a
vague
desire
to
leave
my
room
and
go
down
to
the
lower
floor
this
feeling
became
so
strong
that
at
last
i
rose
intending
to
take
something
to
quiet
myself
going
up
to
my
room
again
i
met
godfrey
standing
under
the
great
window
which
lights
the
staircase
he
was
dressed
as
i
am
accustomed
to
seeing
him
and
i
noticed
that
he
was
looking
at
something
very
intently
he
stood
there
motionless
while
i
held
up
the
lamp
and
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
this
lasted
three
or
four
seconds
after
which
i
continued
my
way
upstairs
he
disappeared
i
was
not
frightened
but
very
much
agitated
and
could
not
go
to
sleep
again
godfrey
thought
very
sensibly
that
the
experiment
which
he
had
tried
would
have
much
more
importance
if
it
were
repeated
a
second
attempt
failed
but
the
third
was
successful
of
course
the
lady
upon
whom
he
operated
was
not
apprised
of
his
intention
any
more
than
on
the
first
occasion
night
she
writes
december
i
retired
to
bed
at
ten
and
was
soon
asleep
suddenly
i
heard
a
voice
which
said
wake
up
and
i
felt
a
hand
touch
the
left
side
of
my
head
godfrey
intention
this
time
was
to
make
her
feel
his
presence
by
voice
and
touch
in
an
instant
i
was
thoroughly
awake
there
was
a
curious
noise
like
a
in
the
chamber
i
felt
too
a
cold
breath
which
seemed
to
envelop
me
my
heart
began
to
beat
violently
and
i
distinctly
saw
a
figure
leaning
over
me
the
only
light
in
the
room
came
from
a
lamp
outside
making
a
long
stream
of
light
over
the
this
was
darkened
by
the
figure
i
turned
quickly
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
hand
fell
from
my
head
to
the
pillow
beside
me
the
figure
was
bent
over
me
and
i
felt
it
rest
against
the
edge
of
the
bed
i
saw
the
arm
on
the
pillow
all
the
time
i
could
see
the
profile
of
the
face
but
dimly
as
if
through
a
haze
it
might
have
been
about
a
minute
and
a
half
the
figure
had
slightly
pushed
back
the
curtain
but
i
noticed
this
morning
that
it
hung
as
usual
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
figure
was
godfrey
i
recognized
him
by
the
turn
of
the
shoulders
and
the
shape
of
the
face
all
the
time
that
he
was
there
a
current
of
cold
air
blew
through
the
room
as
if
the
two
windows
had
been
open
these
are
in
the
present
condition
of
our
knowledge
it
would
be
absolutely
foolhardy
to
seek
to
explain
them
our
psychology
is
not
yet
far
enough
advanced
there
are
a
great
many
things
which
we
are
forced
to
admit
without
the
power
to
explain
them
in
any
way
to
deny
what
we
can
not
explain
would
be
pure
folly
could
any
one
explain
the
world
system
a
thousand
years
ago
even
now
can
we
explain
attraction
but
science
moves
and
its
progress
will
be
endless
do
we
know
the
whole
extent
of
the
human
faculties
the
thinker
can
not
for
a
moment
doubt
that
there
may
be
forces
in
nature
still
unknown
to
us
as
for
example
electricity
was
less
than
a
century
ago
or
that
there
may
be
other
beings
in
the
universe
endowed
with
other
senses
and
faculties
but
is
terrestrial
man
entirely
known
to
us
it
does
not
seem
so
there
are
facts
whose
reality
we
are
forced
to
admit
with
no
power
whatever
to
explain
them
swedenborg
life
offers
three
of
this
nature
let
us
put
aside
for
a
moment
planetary
and
sidereal
visions
which
appear
more
subjective
than
objective
we
will
remark
by
the
way
that
swedenborg
was
a
savant
of
the
first
order
in
geology
mineralogy
and
crystallography
a
member
of
the
academy
of
sciences
of
upsala
of
stockholm
and
of
petersburg
and
we
will
content
ourselves
with
recalling
the
three
following
facts
illustration
the
of
july
this
philosopher
landed
at
gothenburg
on
his
return
from
a
journey
to
england
and
went
to
dine
with
a
certain
william
costel
where
there
was
quite
a
large
company
at
six
o
clock
in
the
evening
swedenborg
who
had
gone
out
came
back
to
the
pale
and
anxious
he
said
a
great
fire
had
at
that
moment
broken
out
at
stockholm
at
the
sÃ¼dermoln
in
the
street
in
which
he
lived
and
that
the
fire
was
spreading
rapidly
towards
his
house
he
went
out
again
and
returned
lamenting
that
a
friend
house
had
just
been
reduced
to
ashes
and
that
his
own
was
in
the
greatest
danger
at
eight
after
being
out
again
he
said
joyfully
thanks
be
to
god
the
fire
has
been
extinguished
at
the
third
house
from
mine
the
news
of
this
spread
throughout
the
city
which
was
all
the
more
excited
because
the
governor
gave
it
attention
and
many
people
were
anxious
for
their
property
or
friends
two
days
afterwards
the
royal
messenger
brought
a
report
of
the
fire
from
stockholm
there
was
no
disagreement
between
his
account
and
that
which
swedenborg
had
given
the
fire
had
been
extinguished
at
eight
this
anecdote
was
written
by
the
celebrated
emmanuel
kant
who
had
desired
to
make
an
inquiry
into
the
facts
and
who
adds
what
can
be
alleged
against
the
authenticity
of
this
occurrence
now
gothenburg
is
two
hundred
kilometres
from
stockholm
swedenborg
was
then
in
his
year
here
is
the
second
fact
in
madame
de
marteville
widow
of
a
minister
from
holland
to
stockholm
received
a
demand
for
the
sum
of
thousand
dutch
florins
ten
thousand
dollars
from
one
of
her
husband
creditors
whom
she
knew
her
husband
had
paid
and
a
second
payment
of
which
would
greatly
embarrass
almost
ruin
her
it
was
impossible
to
find
the
receipt
she
went
to
see
swedenborg
and
a
week
later
she
saw
her
husband
in
a
dream
he
showed
her
the
piece
of
furniture
in
which
the
receipt
had
been
placed
together
with
a
hairpin
set
with
twenty
diamonds
which
she
also
believed
to
be
lost
it
was
at
two
in
the
morning
greatly
elated
she
rose
and
found
everything
at
the
place
indicated
going
back
to
bed
she
slept
until
nine
about
eleven
de
swedenborg
was
announced
he
told
her
that
he
saw
de
marteville
spirit
the
night
before
and
that
he
informed
him
that
he
was
going
to
his
widow
and
now
for
the
third
fact
illustration
in
the
month
of
february
being
in
london
swedenborg
sent
a
note
to
the
rev
john
wesley
founder
of
the
wesleyan
sect
telling
him
that
he
should
be
very
glad
to
make
his
acquaintance
the
zealous
preacher
received
the
note
just
as
he
was
setting
out
on
a
journey
and
replied
that
he
should
profit
by
the
gracious
permission
to
visit
him
on
his
return
which
would
be
in
about
six
months
swedenborg
answered
him
that
in
that
case
they
would
never
see
each
other
in
this
world
as
the
of
the
next
month
was
to
be
the
day
of
his
death
swedenborg
really
died
on
the
date
mentioned
by
himself
more
than
a
month
beforehand
these
are
three
facts
whose
authenticity
it
is
impossible
to
doubt
but
which
in
our
present
condition
of
knowledge
no
one
would
be
able
to
explain
we
might
multiply
these
accounts
indefinitely
facts
analogous
to
those
already
mentioned
of
communications
from
a
distance
whether
at
the
moment
of
death
or
in
the
normal
condition
of
life
are
not
so
rare
without
however
being
very
frequent
but
that
every
one
of
our
readers
may
have
heard
such
cited
or
perhaps
have
observed
them
himself
in
more
than
one
instance
besides
experiments
made
in
the
realms
of
magnetism
show
also
that
under
certain
ascertained
psychological
conditions
an
experimenter
can
act
upon
his
subject
not
only
at
the
distance
of
a
few
metres
but
of
several
kilometres
and
even
of
more
than
a
hundred
kilometres
according
to
the
sensitiveness
of
the
subject
as
well
as
to
the
intensity
of
the
magnetizer
will
moreover
space
is
not
what
we
suppose
the
distance
from
paris
to
london
is
great
for
a
walker
and
was
even
insurmountable
before
the
invention
of
boats
it
is
nothing
for
electricity
the
distance
from
the
earth
to
the
moon
is
great
for
our
present
modes
of
locomotion
it
is
nothing
for
attraction
in
fact
from
an
absolute
point
of
view
the
space
which
separates
us
from
sirius
is
not
a
greater
part
of
infinity
than
the
distance
from
paris
to
versailles
or
from
your
left
eye
to
your
right
there
is
more
yet
the
separation
which
seems
to
us
to
exist
between
the
earth
and
the
moon
or
between
the
earth
and
mars
or
even
between
the
earth
and
sirius
is
only
an
illusion
due
to
the
insufficiency
of
our
perceptions
the
moon
acts
constantly
upon
the
earth
and
moves
it
perpetually
the
attraction
of
mars
for
our
planet
is
equally
acute
and
we
in
our
turn
disturb
mars
in
its
course
in
submitting
to
the
influence
of
the
moon
we
act
upon
the
sun
itself
and
make
it
move
as
if
we
touched
it
by
virtue
of
attraction
the
moon
causes
the
earth
to
turn
every
month
around
their
common
centre
of
gravity
a
point
which
travels
one
thousand
seven
hundred
kilometres
below
the
surface
of
the
globe
the
earth
causes
the
sun
to
turn
annually
around
their
common
centre
of
gravity
situated
four
hundred
and
kilometres
from
the
solar
centre
all
the
worlds
act
upon
each
other
perpetually
so
that
there
is
no
isolation
no
real
separation
between
them
instead
of
being
a
void
separating
the
worlds
from
one
another
space
is
rather
a
connecting
link
now
if
attraction
thus
establishes
a
real
perpetual
active
and
indisputable
communication
between
the
earth
and
its
sisters
in
immensity
as
proved
by
the
precision
of
astronomical
observations
we
do
not
see
by
what
right
pretended
positivists
can
declare
that
no
communication
can
be
possible
between
two
beings
more
or
less
distant
from
each
other
either
on
the
earth
or
in
two
different
worlds
can
not
two
brains
that
vibrate
in
unison
at
a
distance
of
many
kilometres
be
moved
by
the
same
psychic
force
can
not
the
emotion
which
starts
from
a
brain
reach
a
brain
vibrating
at
no
matter
what
distance
just
as
sound
crosses
a
room
making
the
strings
of
a
piano
or
violin
vibrate
do
not
forget
that
our
brains
are
composed
of
molecules
which
do
not
touch
and
which
are
in
constant
vibration
and
why
speak
of
brains
can
not
thought
will
psychic
force
whatever
its
nature
may
be
act
on
a
being
to
whom
it
is
attached
by
the
sympathetic
and
indissoluble
ties
of
intellectual
relationship
do
not
the
palpitations
of
a
heart
suddenly
transmit
themselves
to
the
heart
which
beats
in
unison
with
ours
are
we
to
admit
in
the
cases
of
apparitions
noted
above
that
the
mind
of
the
dead
has
really
assumed
a
corporeal
form
when
near
the
observer
in
the
greater
part
of
the
cases
this
hypothesis
does
not
seem
necessary
in
our
dreams
we
think
we
see
persons
who
are
not
before
our
closed
eyes
at
all
we
see
them
perfectly
as
well
as
in
broad
daylight
we
speak
to
them
converse
with
them
surely
it
is
neither
our
retina
nor
our
optic
nerve
which
sees
them
any
more
than
our
ear
hears
them
our
cerebral
cells
alone
are
concerned
in
it
certain
apparitions
may
be
objective
exterior
and
substantial
others
may
be
subjective
in
that
case
the
being
who
manifests
himself
would
act
from
a
distance
on
the
being
who
sees
and
this
influence
on
his
brain
would
determine
the
interior
vision
which
appears
exterior
as
in
dreams
but
may
be
purely
subjective
and
interior
just
as
a
thought
a
memory
may
arouse
an
image
in
our
minds
which
may
be
very
distinct
and
very
vivid
just
so
one
intelligence
acting
upon
another
may
make
an
image
appear
in
him
which
will
for
a
moment
give
him
the
illusion
of
reality
it
is
not
the
retina
which
is
affected
by
a
positive
reality
it
is
the
optic
thalami
of
the
brain
which
are
excited
in
what
way
the
present
state
of
our
physiological
and
psychological
knowledge
does
not
yet
teach
us
that
such
are
the
most
rational
inductions
which
it
seems
possible
to
derive
from
the
phenomena
to
which
we
have
just
been
giving
our
attention
unexplained
but
very
old
phenomena
for
the
histories
of
all
peoples
from
the
highest
antiquity
have
preserved
examples
of
it
which
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
deny
or
efface
but
it
will
be
asked
ought
we
can
we
admit
in
our
age
of
experimental
methods
and
positive
science
that
a
dying
or
even
a
dead
man
can
communicate
with
any
one
what
is
a
dead
man
a
human
being
dies
every
second
on
the
whole
terrestrial
globe
that
is
thousand
four
hundred
per
day
about
millions
per
year
or
more
than
three
milliards
per
century
in
ten
centuries
more
than
thirty
milliards
of
corpses
have
been
committed
to
the
earth
and
given
back
to
general
circulation
under
the
form
of
various
products
water
gas
etc
if
we
keep
an
account
of
the
diminution
of
human
population
as
we
count
up
the
historic
ages
we
find
that
for
ten
thousand
years
least
two
hundred
milliards
of
human
bodies
have
been
formed
from
the
earth
and
from
the
atmosphere
by
respiration
and
nourishment
and
have
returned
to
molecules
of

hydrogen
carbonic
acid
and
nitrogen
which
have
constituted
these

have
enriched
the

and
been
given

yes
the
earth
we
inhabit
is
now
formed
partly
of
the
milliards
of
brains
which
have
thought
the
milliards
of
organisms
who
have
lived
we
walk
over
the
remains
of
our
ancestors
as
our
descendants
will
walk
over
ours
the
brows
of

eyes
which
have
looked
smiled
and
wept
mouths
which
have
sung
of

and

who
have

lie
in
the
same
earth
it
would
be
difficult
now
to
take
a
single
step
on
the
planet
without
walking
on
the
remains
of
the
dead
it
would
be
difficult
to
breathe
without
inhaling
the
breath
of
the
dead
the
constructive
elements
of
the
body
draw
upon
nature
and
are
returned
to
nature
and
each
one
of
us
bears
in
himself
atoms
which
have
formerly
belonged
to
other
bodies
ah
well
do
you
think
that
can
be
all
of
humanity
do
you
think
it
may
not
have
left
something
nobler
grander
and
more
spiritual
does
each
of
us
give
the
universe
when
we
breathe
our
last
nothing
but
sixty
or
eighty
kilos
of
flesh
and
bone
which
will
disintegrate
and
return
to
the
elements
does
not
the
soul
which
animates
us
endure
by
the
same
right
as
each
molecule
of
oxygen
or
nitrogen
or
iron
and
all
the
souls
that
have
lived
do
they
not
still
exist
we
have
no
right
to
affirm
that
man
is
composed
solely
of
material
elements
and
that
the
thinking
faculty
is
only
one
property
of
the
organization
on
the
contrary
we
have
the
strongest
reasons
for
admitting
that
the
soul
is
an
individual
entity
that
it
is
that
which
governs
the
molecules
to
organize
the
living
form
of
the
human
body
what
becomes
of
the
invisible
and
intangible
molecules
which
have
composed
our
body
during
life
they
will
belong
to
new
bodies
what
becomes
of
the
equally
invisible
and
intangible
souls
it
may
be
thought
that
they
also
reincarnate
themselves
in
new
organisms
each
in
accordance
with
its
nature
its
faculties
and
its
destiny
the
soul
belongs
to
the
psychic
world
doubtless
there
is
on
the
earth
an
innumerable
quantity
of
souls
still
heavy
and
coarse
barely
freed
from
matter
and
incapable
of
conceiving
intellectual
realities
but
there
are
others
who
live
in
study
in
contemplation
in
the
culture
of
the
psychic
or
spiritual
world
those
can
not
remain
imprisoned
on
the
earth
and
their
destiny
is
to
live
the
uranian

the
uranian
soul
even
during
its
terrestrial
incarnations
lives
in
the
world
of
the
absolute
and
divine
it
knows
that
though
dwelling
on
the
earth
it
is
really
in
heaven
and
that
our
planet
is
a
star
of
heaven
what
is
the
inner
nature
of
the
soul
what
are
its
ways
of
manifestation
when
does
its
memory
become
permanent
and
maintain
with
certainty
a
conscious
identity
under
what
variety
of
forms
and
substances
can
it
live
what
extent
of
space
can
it
overcome
what
is
the
order
of
intellectual
relationship
which
exists
among
the

of
the

what
is
the

sows
the

we
put
ourselves
in
communication
with
the
neighboring

when
shall
we
penetrate
the
profound
secret

destiny
mystery
and
ignorance
the
unknown
of
yesterday
is
the
truth
of
illustration
it
is
an
historic
and
scientific
fact
and
absolutely
incontestable
that
in
all
ages
among
all
peoples
and
under
the
most
diverse
religious
manifestations
the
idea
of
immortality
rests
invulnerable
at
the
base
of
human
consciousness
education
has
given
it
a
thousand
forms
but
did
not
invent
it
it
exists
of
itself
every
human
being
coming
into

with

the
hours
and
days
that
i
devoted
to
the
study
of
these
psychological
and
telepathical
questions
did
not
prevent
my
observing
mars
through
the
telescope
and
taking
geographical
drawings
of
it
every
time
that
our
atmosphere
so
often
cloudy
would
permit
besides
it
may
be
realized
that
while
in
the
study
of
nature
and
in
science
all
questions
are
related
to
each
other
yet
that
astronomy
and
psychology
are
most
closely
united
to
each
other
since
the
psychic
universe
has
the
material
world
for
its
habitat
while
astronomy
has
for
its
object
the
study
of
the
regions
of
eternal
life
and
we
could
form
no
idea
of
these
regions
if
we
did
not
know
them
astronomically
in
fact
whether
we
know
it
or
not
we
are
living
now
at
this
moment
in
heavenly
regions
and
all

whatever
they

are

citizens
of

it
was
not
without
a
secret
divination
of
things
that
antiquity
made
urania
the
muse
of
all
the
sciences
my
mind
had
been
occupied
with
the
planet
mars
for
a
long
time
when
one
day
in
a
solitary
ramble
on
the
edge
of
a
wood
after
several
hours
of
july
heat
i
seated
myself
at
the
foot
of
a
clump
of
and
was
not
long
in
dropping
off
to
sleep
the
heat
was
overpowering
the
landscape
silent
the
seine
seemed
quiet
as
a
canal
at
the
bottom
of
the
valley
i
was
strangely
surprised
on
waking
up
after
a
few
minutes
nap
at
no
longer
recognizing
the
landscape
nor
the
trees
nor
the
river
flowing
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
nor
the
undulating
meadows
which
stretched
far
away
to
the
distant
horizon
the
setting
sun
was
smaller
than
we
are
accustomed
to
see
it
the
air
thrilled
with
harmonious
sounds
unknown
to
earth
and
insects
as
large
as
birds
were
fluttering
about
on
the
leafless
trees
which
were
covered
with
gigantic
red
flowers
astonishment
made
me
spring
up
with
so
energetic
a
bound
that
i
found
myself
on
my
feet
feeling
singularly
light
and
buoyant
i
had
taken
but
a
few
steps
before
it
seemed
to
me
that
more
than
half
the
weight
of
my
body
had
evaporated
during
my
sleep
this
inner
sensation
struck
me
even
more
forcibly
than
the
metamorphosis
of
nature
spread
out
before
me
i
could
hardly
believe
my
eyes
or
senses
besides
my
eyes
were
not
at
all
the
same
i
did
not
hear
in
the
same
way
and
i
realized
at
once
that
my
organization
had
developed
several
new
senses
quite
different
from
those
of
our
terrestrial
body
especially
a
magnetic
sense
by
which
one
being
can
communicate
with
another
without
the
necessity
of
translating
thoughts
audibly
by
words
this
sense
reminds
one
of
the
magnetic
needle
which
from
a
cellar
in
the
paris
observatory
starts
and
shivers
when
an
aurora
borealis
appears
in
siberia
or
when
an
electric
explosion
breaks
out
in
the
sun
the
orb
of
day
had
just
sunk
in
a
distant
lake
and
the
rosy
gleams
of
twilight
were
hovering
far
down
the
sky
like
a
last
dream
of
light
two
moons
were
beginning
to
shed
their
rays
at
different
heights
the
first
a
crescent
hung
over
the
lake
in
whose
bosom
the
sun
had
disappeared
the
second
in
its
first
quarter
was
much
higher
and
towards
the
east
they
were
very
small
and
but
distantly
resembled
the
immense
torch
of
our
earthly
nights
it
seemed
as
if
they
shed
their
bright
but
feeble
rays
regretfully
i
looked
from
one
to
the
other
in
utter
bewilderment
perhaps
the
strangest
thing
in
all
this
strange
spectacle
was
that
the
western
moon
which
was
about
three
times
as
large
as
its
companion
in
the
east
although
five
times
smaller
than
our
terrestrial
moon
travelled
through
the
sky
with
a
motion
very
easy
to
follow
with
the
eye
and
seemed
to
speed
quickly
from
right
to
left
to
join
its
celestial
sister
in
the
west
a
third
moon
or
rather
a
brilliant
star
could
also
be
seen
in
the
last
beams
of
the
setting
sun
which
were
dying
away
smaller
than
the
smallest
of
the
satellites
it
showed
no
appreciable
disk
but
its
light
was
dazzling
it
looked
out
from
the
evening
sky
as
venus
in
her
most
brilliant
season
beams
in
our
own
heavens
when
the
shepherd
star
reigns
like
a
queen
over
balmy
evenings
in
spring
and
weaves
the
fabric
of
happy
dreams
the
more
brilliant
stars
were
already
lighting
up
the
sky
i
recognized
arcturus
with
its
golden
rays
vega
so
white
and
pure
the
seven
stars
of
the
septentrion
and
several
of
the
zodiacal
constellations
the
evening
star
the
new
vesper
was
shining
in
the
constellation
of
the
fishes
after
having
studied
its
position
in
the
heavens
for
a
few
moments
and
finding
out
by
the
constellations
where
i
was
myself
after
examining
the
two
satellites
and
reflecting
on
the
lightness
of
my
own
body
i
was
convinced
that
i
was
on
the
planet
mars
and
that
the
beautiful
evening
star
was
the
earth
illustration
my
eyes
rested
on
it
with
that
feeling
of
mournful
love
which
thrills
the
fibres
of
our
hearts
when
our
thoughts
fly
away
to
a
beloved
object
from
whom
we
are
separated
by
cruel
distance
for
a
long
time
i
looked
at
that
fatherland
where
so
many
different
feelings
meet
and
jostle
each
other
and
i
thought
what
a
pity
it
is
that
the
numberless
human
beings
living
on
that
little
habitation
do
not
know
where
they
are
that
little
earth
is
most
beautiful
thus
lighted
up
by
the
sun
with
its
microscopic
moon
which
looks
like
a
speck
beside
it
borne
through
the
invisible
by
the
divine
laws
of
attraction
a
floating
atom
in
the
harmony
of
the
skies
it
fills
its
place
and
hovers
overhead
like
an
angelic
island
but
its
inhabitants
are
unaware
of
it
singular
humanity
they
find
the
earth
too
wide
so
divide
themselves
up
into
flocks
and
spend
their
time
shooting
one
another
in
that
angelic
isle
there
are
as
many
soldiers
as
there
are
male
inhabitants
they
are
all
in
arms
against
one
another
and
think
it
glorious
to
change
the
names
of
countries
and
the
colors
of
flags
when
it
would
have
been
so
simple
a
matter
to
live
peacefully
war
is
the
favorite
occupation
of
its
nations
and
the
primordial
education
of
the
people
aside
from
that
they
spend
their
existence
in
adoring
matter
they
do
not
appreciate
intellectual
worth
are
indifferent
to
the
most
wonderful
problems
of
creation
and
live
an
objectless
life
what
a
pity
a
citizen
of
paris
who
had
never
heard
the
city
name
mentioned
nor
that
of
france
would
not
be
more
of
a
stranger
than
they
in
their
own
country
ah
if
they
could
but
see
the
earth
from
here
how
delighted
they
would
be
to
return
to
it
and
how
transformed
all
their
ideas
would
be
both
general
and
individual
then
they
would
at
least
know
the
land
they
live
in
it
would
be
a
beginning
they
would
study
progressively
the
sublime
truths
about
it
instead
of
vegetating
under
a
horizonless
fog
and
after
a
while
they
would
live
the
true
life
the
intellectual
life
illustration
what
honor
he
pays
it
one
would
think
he
had
left
friends
in
that
prison
yonder
i
had
not
spoken
but
i
distinctly
heard
this
sentence
which
seemed
like
a
reply
to
my
inward
conversation
two
of
the
dwellers
upon
mars
were
looking
at
and
had
understood
me
by
virtue
of
that
sixth
sense
of
magnetic
perception
to
which
i
before
alluded
i
was
somewhat
confused
and
i
must
confess
deeply
wounded
by
this
apostrophe
after
all
i
thought
i
love
the
earth
it
is
my
country
and
i
am
patriotic
my
two
neighbors
both
began
to
laugh
yes
answered
one
of
them
with
unexpected
you
are
patriotic
any
one
might
know
that
you
have
just
come
from
the
earth
and
the
elder
added
let
your
compatriots
alone
they
will
never
be
any
more
intelligent
or
less
blind
than
they
are
now
they
have
been
there
eighty
thousand
years
already
and
you
yourself
acknowledge
that
they
are
not
yet
capable
of
thinking
it
is
really
very
absurd
of
you
to
look
at
the
earth
with
such
sorrowful
eyes
it
is
too
foolish
dear
reader
have
you
not
in
your
journey
through
the
world
sometimes
met
men
who
were
puffed
up
with
imperturbable
pride
and
who
thought
themselves
sincerely
and
unquestionably
above
all
the
rest
of
the
world
when
these
proud
personages
find
themselves
face
to
face
with
anything
superior
they
are
instantly
hostile
to
it
they
can
not
endure
it
very
well
in
the
preceding
dithyramb
of
which
you
have
had
but
a
very
poor
translation
i
felt
myself
greatly
superior
to
earthly
humanity
since
i
felt
pity
for
it
and
invoked
for
it
better
days
but
when
these
two
inhabitants
of
mars
pitied
me
and
i
thought
i
discovered
in
them
a
cold
superiority
to
myself
i
was
for
a
moment
like
these
foolish
proud
people
my
blood
gave
one
bound
and
restraining
myself
by
a
remnant
of
french
politeness
i
opened
my
mouth
to
say
after
all
gentlemen
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
are
not
as
stupid
as
you
appear
to
think
but
are
worth
perhaps
more
than
you
unfortunately
they
did
not
give
me
time
to
begin
my
sentence
inasmuch
as
they
had
understood
it
all
while
it
was
being
formed
by
the
vibration
of
the
substance
of
the
brain
illustration
permit
me
to
remark
at
once
said
the
younger
that
your
planet
is
an
absolute
failure
in
consequence
of
an
occurrence
which
happened
about
ten
million
years
ago
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
primary
period
of
the
earthly
genesis
there
were
plants
already
and
very
fine
plants
too
the
first
animals
were
beginning
to
appear
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
and
along
the
shores
mollusks
that
were
headless
deaf
mute
and
without
sex
you
know
that
respiration
is
all
a
tree
requires
for
its
entire
nourishment
and
that
your
most
robust
oaks
your
most
gigantic
cedars
have
never
eaten
anything
and
that
that
has
not
prevented
their
growth
they
are
nourished
solely
by
respiration
misfortune
fatality
had
willed
that
a
drop
of
water
thicker
than
the
surrounding
medium
should
pass
through
one
of
the
mollusks
perhaps
he
liked
it
that
was
the
first
digestive
tube
which
was
to
exert
so
baleful
an
effect
on
the
entire
animal
kingdom
and
later
on
mankind
itself
the
first
murderer
was
the
mollusk
who
ate
here
we
do
not
eat
have
never
eaten
and
never
shall
eat
creation
is
developing
itself
gradually
peacefully
and
nobly
as
it
began
organisms
are
nourished
or
to
express
it
differently
renew
their
molecules
by
a
simple
respiration
like
your
terrestrial
trees
each
leaf
of
which
is
a
little
stomach
in
your
precious
country
you
can
live
a
single
day
only
on
condition
of
killing
with
you
the
law
of
life
is
the
law
of
death
here
the
idea
of
killing
even
a
bird
has
never
occurred
to
any
one
illustration
you
are
all
more
or
less
butchers
your
hands
are
stained
with
blood
your
stomachs
are
gorged
with
food
how
can
you
expect
to
have
wholesome
pure
elevated
ideas
i
will
even
say
excuse
my
frankness
clean
ideas
with
such
coarse
organisms
what
souls
could
live
in
such
bodies
reflect
a
moment
and
do
not
soothe
yourself
any
more
with
blind
illusions
too
ideal
for
such
a

what
i
cried
interrupting
him
do
you
deny

ah
my
dear
martial
let
me
in
my
turn
regret
that
you
know
the
earth
only
from
afar
you
are
mistaken
there
i
lived
in
that
world
for
fifty
years
that
was
enough
for
me
and
i
assure
you
i
would
not
return
to
it
again
everything
is
a
failure
there
even
what
seems
most
delightful
to
you
do
you
imagine
that
in
all
the
earths
of
heaven
the
flowers
produce
the
fruits
of
the
same
sorts
would
not
that
be
a
little
cruel
as
for
me
i
like
primroses
and
rosebuds
well
but
still
i
answered
notwithstanding
all
that
there
have
been
great
minds
on
the
earth
and
creatures
really
worthy
of
admiration
may
we
not
comfort
ourselves
with
the
hope
that
physical
and
moral
beauty
will
go
on
perfecting
themselves
more
and
more
as
they
have
done
hitherto
and
that
intelligence
will
enlighten
itself
progressively
we
do
not
spend
all
our
time
eating
men
will
surely
end
in
spite
of
their
material
labors
by
giving
up
a
few
hours
every
day
to
the
development
of
their
understanding
then
probably
they
will
no
longer
continue
to
manufacture
little
gods
in
their
own
image
and
perhaps
also
they
will
abolish
their
childish
boundaries
so
that
harmony
and
fraternity
may
reign
illustration
no
my
friend
for
if
they
wished
it
they
could
do
so
now
but
they
are
very
careful
not
to
terrestrial
man
is
a
little
animal
who
on
the
one
hand
feels
no
need
of
thinking
not
even
having
independence
of
soul
and
who
on
the
other
likes
to
fight
and
squarely
establishes
right
by
might
such
is
his
good
pleasure
and
such
is
his
nature
you
will
never
make
peaches
grow
on
a
remember
that
the
most
exquisite
beauties
to
whom
you
alluded
just
now
are
but
coarse
monsters
compared
to
the
aerial
women
of
mars
who
live
on
our
spring
air
the
perfume
of
our
flowers
and
are
so
captivating
in
the
very
quivering
of
their
wings
in
the
ideal
kiss
of
a
mouth
which
has
never
eaten
that
if
dante
beatrice
had
been
of
such
a
nature
the
immortal
florentine
would
never
have
been
able
to
write
two
of
the
parts
of
his
comedy
he
would
have
begun
with
paradise
and
could
never
have
left
it
reflect
that
our
youths
have
as
much
innate
science
as
pythagoras
archimedes
euclid
kepler
newton
laplace
and
darwin
after
all
their
laborious
studies
our
twelve
senses
put
us
in
direct
communication
with
the
universe
we
feel
from
here
jupiter
attraction
as
he
passes
a
hundred
million
leagues
away
we
see
the
rings
of
saturn
with
the
naked
eye
we
detect
the
coming
of
a
comet
and
our
body
is
impregnated
with
the
solar
electricity
which
puts
all
nature
in
vibration
here
there
has
never
been
either
religious
fanaticism
or
executioners
or
martyrs
or
international
divisions
or
wars
but
from
the
first
humanity
naturally
peaceful
and
freed
from
all
material
needs
has
lived
independent
in
body
and
mind
in
a
constant
intellectual
activity
raising
itself
unhindered
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
but
come
over
here
illustration
i
walked
a
few
steps
on
the
with
my
new
acquaintances
and
coming
in
sight
of
the
other
slope
i
saw
multitudes
of
different
colored
lights
flitting
about
in
the
air
it
was
the
inhabitants
who
when
they
desire
it
become
luminous
at
night
aerial
cars
apparently
formed
of
phosphorescent
flowers
were
carrying
orchestras
and
choruses
one
of
them
passed
us
and
we
took
our
places
in
it
in
the
midst
of
a
cloud
of
perfumes
the
sensations
which
i
experienced
were
singularly
unlike
any
which
i
had
ever
felt
on
the
earth
and
this
first
night
on
mars
passed
like
a
rapid
dream
for
the
dawn
found
me
still
in
the
aerial
car
conversing
with
my
entertainers
their
friends
and
their
indescribably
lovely
companions
what
a
panorama
with
the
rising
sun
flowers
fruits
perfumes
palaces
rose
on
the
islands
with
their
orange
vegetation
the
waters
stretched
themselves
out
like
limpid
mirrors
and
joyous
aerial
couples
were
whirling
down
to
these
enchanting
shores
there
all
material
work
is
done
by
machines
and
directed
by
a
few
perfected
races
of
animals
whose
intelligence
is
very
nearly
of
the
same
order
as
that
of
mankind
on
the
earth
the
inhabitants
live
only
for
and
by
the
mind
their
nervous
system
has
reached
such
a
degree
of
development
that
each
one
of
these
beings
at
once
very
delicate
and
very
strong
seems
an
electric
battery
and
their
most
sensual
impressions
felt
more
by
their
souls
than
their
bodies
surpass
a
hundredfold
all
those
that
our
five
terrestrial
senses
together
could
ever
offer
us
a
kind
of
summer
palace
illuminated
by
the
rays
of
the
rising
sun
opened
beneath
our
aerial
gondola
my
neighbor
whose
wings
were
fluttering
with
impatience
placed
her
delicate
foot
upon
a
tuft
of
flowers
which
rose
between
two
jets
of
perfume
will
you
return
to
the
earth
she
asked
holding
out
her
arms
to
me
never
i
cried
springing
towards
her
but
at
that
moment
i
found
myself
alone
near
the
wood
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
at
whose
feet
the
seine
was
winding
with
undulating
curves
illustration
i
repeated
trying
to
grasp
the
sweet
vanished
dream
once
more
where
had
i
been
it
was
beautiful
the
sun
had
just
set
and
the
planet
mars
then
very
brilliant
was
already
shining
in
the
sky
ah
i
said
as
a
fugitive
beam
reached
me
i
have
been
there
drawn
by
the
same
attraction
the
two
neighboring
planets
are
looking
at
each
other
through
transparent
space
may
we
not
catch
a
first
glimpse
of
the
eternal
journey
from
this
celestial
fraternity
the
earth
is
no
longer
alone
in
the
universe
the
panoramas
of
the
infinite
are
beginning
to
open
themselves
out
whether
we
live
here
or
near
by
we
are
not
the
citizens
of
a
country
or
of
a
world
but
are
in
very
truth
the
of
illustration
iii
the
planet
mars
had
i
been
the
plaything
of
a
dream
had
my
spirit
really
been
transported
to
the
planet
mars
or
had
i
been
the
dupe
of
a
purely
imaginary
illusion
the
feeling
of
reality
had
been
so
strong
so
intense
and
the
things
i
had
seen
agreed
so
perfectly
with
the
scientific
notions
which
we
already
possess
in
regard
to
the
physical
nature
of
the
martial
world
that
i
could
not
entertain
a
doubt
on
the
subject
although
amazed
at
that
ecstatic
trip
and
asking
myself
a
thousand
questions
each
one
contradicting
the
other
spero
absence
in
all
that
vision
puzzled
me
a
little
i
still
felt
so
closely
attached
to
his
dear
memory
that
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
i
should
have
been
able
to
detect
his
presence
to
fly
directly
to
him
see
him
speak
to
him
hear
him
but
was
not
the
man
hypnotized
at
nancy
the
toy
of
his
own
imagination
or
of
mine
or
of
the
experimenter
on
the
other
hand
even
admitting
that
my
two
friends
had
been
reincarnated
upon
that
neighboring
planet
i
reflected
that
beings
might
easily
not
meet
one
another
in
going
about
the
same
city
and
in
a
world
the
chances
were
infinitely
less
and
yet
surely
it
was
not
the
doctrine
of
chances
which
should
be
invoked
in
this
case
for
such
a
feeling
of
attraction
as
that
which
had
united
us
ought
to
increase
the
probability
of
our
meeting
and
throw
an
element
into
the
scale
which
should
outweigh
all
the
rest
illustration
talking
thus
with
myself
i
went
back
to
my
observatory
at
juvisy
where
i
had
been
preparing
some
electric
batteries
for
an
optical
experiment
with
the
tower
of
montlhÃ©ry
when
i
had
satisfied
myself
that
everything
was
in
readiness
i
left
the
task
of
making
the
signals
agreed
upon
between
ten
and
eleven
to
my
assistant
and
went
to
the
old
tower
where
i
installed
myself
an
hour
later
the
night
had
come
from
the
top
of
the
old
donjon
the
horizon
is
perfectly
circular
entirely
free
in
all
its
circumference
which
extended
on
a
radius
of
twenty
to
kilometres
all
around
this
central
point
a
third
post
of
observation
situated
in
paris
was
in
communication
with
us
the
object
of
the
experiment
was
to
find
out
whether
the
rays
of
different
colors
of
the
luminous
spectrum
all
travel
with
the
same
speed
kilometres
a
second
the
result
was
affirmative
illustration
the
experiments
were
ended
at
about
eleven
the
starry
night
was
marvellous
and
the
moon
was
beginning
to
rise
as
soon
as
i
had
put
the
apparatus
under
cover
inside
the
tower
i
went
to
the
upper
platform
again
to
look
at
the
broad
landscape
lighted
by
the
first
rays
of
the
waxing
moon
the
atmosphere
was
calm
mild
almost
warm
but
my
foot
was
still
on
the
last
step
when
i
stopped
uttering
a
cry
which
seemed
to
die
away
in
my
throat
spero
yes
spero
himself
was
there
before
me
seated
on
the
parapet
i
threw
up
my
arms
and
felt
as
if
i
were
going
to
faint
but
he
said
in
his
gentle
voice
which
i
knew
so
well
do
i
frighten
you
i
had
not
strength
enough
to
reply
or
to
advance
and
still
i
dared
to
look
at
my
friend
who
was
smiling
at
me
his
dear
face
lighted
by
the
moonlight
was
just
as
i
had
seen
it
when
he
left
paris
for
christiania
young
pleasant
and
thoughtful
with
a
very
animated
look
i
left
the
stairs
and
felt
a
strong
desire
to
rush
to
him
and
embrace
him
but
i
dared
not
and
stood
looking
at
him
when
i
had
recovered
my
senses
i
cried
spero
it
is
you
i
was
there
during
your
experiments
he
replied
and
it
was
i
who
inspired
you
with
the
idea
of
comparing
the
intense
violet
with
the
intense
red
for
the
speed
of
the
luminous
waves
only
i
was
invisible
like
the
rays
can
it
really
be
so
let
me
look
at
you
and
feel
you
i
passed
my
hands
over
his
face
and
body
through
his
hair
and
had
precisely
the
same
impression
as
if
he
had
been
a
living
being
my
reason
refused
to
admit
the
testimony
of
my
eyes
and
hands
and
ears
yet
i
could
not
doubt
that
it
was
really
he
there
could
not
be
such
a
resemblance
and
then
too
my
doubts
would
have
disappeared
at
his
first
words
for
he
at
once
added
my
body
is
at
this
moment
sleeping
in
mars
so
i
said
you
still
exist
you
are
living
now
and
you
know
at
last
the
answer
to
the
great
problem
that
so
distressed
you
and
iclÃ©a
we
will
have
a
long
talk
he
answered
i
have
many
things
to
tell
you
i
sat
down
beside
him
on
the
edge
of
the
wide
parapet
which
rises
above
the
old
tower
and
this
is
what
i
heard
shortly
after
the
accident
at
lake
tyrifiorden
he
had
felt
like
a
man
who
awakes
from
a
long
and
heavy
sleep
he
was
alone
in
midnight
darkness
on
the
border
of
a
lake
he
knew
that
he
was
living
but
could
neither
see
nor
feel
himself
the
air
did
not
affect
him
he
was
not
only
light
but
imponderable
apparently
what
remained
of
him
was
solely
his
thinking
faculty
his
first
idea
on
trying
to
remember
was
that
he
had
awakened
from
his
fall
by
the
norwegian
lake
but
when
the
day
broke
he
saw
that
he
was
in
another
world
the
two
moons
revolving
rapidly
in
the
sky
in
opposite
directions
made
him
surmise
that
he
was
upon
our
neighbor
the
planet
mars
and
other
evidences
soon
proved
that
he
was
correct
he
lived
there
for
a
while
in
the
spirit
state
and
recognized
there
the
presence
of
a
very
beautiful
humanity
in
which
the
feminine
sex
reigns
supreme
from
an
acknowledged
superiority
over
the
masculine
sex
these
organisms
are
light
and
delicate
their
density
of
body
very
slight
their
weight
slighter
still
on
the
surface
of
this
world
material
force
plays
but
a
secondary
part
in
nature
delicacy
of
sensation
decides
everything
there
is
a
large
number
of
animal
species
and
several
human
races
in
all
these
species
and
races
the
feminine
sex
is
stronger
and
handsomer
the
strength
consisting
in
the
superiority
of
sensation
than
the
masculine
sex
and
it
is
she
who
rules
the
world
his
great
desire
to
know
the
life
before
him
induced
him
not
to
remain
long
as
an
onlooker
in
the
spirit
state
but
to
come
to
life
again
under
a
corporeal
form
and
knowing
the
organic
condition
of
this
planet
in
a
feminine
form
among
the
terrestrial
souls
floating
about
in
the
atmosphere
of
mars
he
had
already
met
iclÃ©a
for
souls
feel
each
other
who
had
followed
him
guided
by
a
constant
attraction
she
on
her
part
had
felt
inclined
towards
a
masculine
incarnation
thus
they
were
reunited
in
one
of
the
most
privileged
countries
in
that
world
neighbors
and
predestined
to
meet
again
in
life
to
share
the
same
emotions
the
same
thoughts
the
same
works
thus
although
the
memory
of
their
earthly
life
remained
veiled
and
as
if
effaced
by
the
new
transformation
yet
a
vague
feeling
of
spiritual
relationship
and
an
immediate
sympathetic
attachment
had
reunited
them
as
soon
as
they
saw
each
other
their
psychic
superiority
the
nature
of
their
habitual
thoughts
their
condition
of
mind
accustomed
to
seek
ends
and
causes
had
given
them
both
a
kind
of
inward
clairvoyance
which
freed
them
from
the
general
ignorance
of
the
living
they
had
fallen
in
love
with
each
other
so
suddenly
they
had
yielded
so
passively
to
the
magnetic
influence
of
the
of
their
meeting
that
they
soon
formed
but
a
single
being
united
as
at
the
time
of
their
earthly
separation
they
remembered
that
they
had
met
before
and
were
sure
that
it
must
have
been
on
the
earth
that
neighboring
planet
which
shines
in
the
evening
so
brilliantly
in
the
sky
of
mars
and
sometimes
in
their
solitary
flights
over
the
little
hills
peopled
with
aerial
plants
they
contemplated
the
evening
star
trying
to
the
broken
thread
of
an
interrupted
tradition
an
unexpected
event
explained
their
reminiscences
and
proved
that
they
were
not
mistaken
the
inhabitants
of
mars
are
very
superior
to
those
of
earth
by
their
organizations
by
the
number
and
delicacy
of
their
senses
and
by
their
intellectual
faculties
the
fact
that
density
is
very
slight
on
the
surface
of
that
world
and
that
the
constituent
particles
of
bodies
are
less
heavy
there
than
here
has
permitted
the
formation
of
beings
of
incomparably
less
weight
more
aerial
more
delicate
more
sensitive
the
fact
that
the
atmosphere
is
nutritive
has
freed
martial
organisms
from
the
coarseness
of
earthly
needs
it
is
an
entirely
different
state
of
things
the
light
there
is
less
bright
that
planet
being
farther
from
the
sun
than
we
and
the
optic
nerve
is
more
sensitive
electric
and
magnetic
influences
being
very
intense
the
inhabitants
possess
senses
unknown
to
terrestrial
organizations
senses
which
put
them
into
communication
with
these
influences
everything
is
evenly
balanced
in
nature
beings
are
everywhere
adapted
to
their
surroundings
and
to
the
soil
from
which
they
spring
organisms
can
no
more
be
earthly
on
mars
than
they
could
be
aerial
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
more
than
that
the
condition
of
superiority
generated
by
this
nature
of
things
is
developed
of
itself
by
the
facility
by
which
all
intellectual
work
is
accomplished
nature
seems
to
obey
thought
the
architect
desirous
of
erecting
a
building
the
engineer
who
wants
to
change
the
surface
of
the
ground
either
to
lower
or
to
raise
to
cut
down
mountains
or
fill
up
valleys
does
not
strike
against
material
weight
and
material
difficulties
as
he
does
here
art
too
has
made
the
most
rapid
progress
from
the
beginning
and
yet
more
martial
humanity
being
several
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
older
than
terrestrial
humanity
went
through
all
the
phases
of
its
development
before
we
did
our
real
scientific
progress
even
the
most
transcendent
is
but
a
child
foolish
toy
compared
to
the
science
of
the
inhabitants
of
that
planet
in
astronomy
especially
they
are
incomparably
more
advanced
than
we
and
know
the
earth
much
better
than
we
know
their
home
they
have
invented
among
other
things
a
kind
of
apparatus
in
which
a
roll
of
stuff
constantly
receives
the
picture
of
our
world
and
is
impressed
by
it
unalterably
as
it
unrolls
an
immense
museum
devoted
especially
to
the
planets
of
the
solar
system
preserves
all
these
photographic
pictures
fixed
forever
in
chronological
order
all
the
earth
history
is
to
be
found
there
france
in
the
time
of
charlemagne
greece
in
the
days
of
alexander
egypt
under
rameses
by
the
microscope
the
smallest
details
can
be
made
out
such
as
paris
during
the
french
revolution
rome
under
the
pontificate
of
borgia
christopher
columbus
spanish
fleet
reaching
america
the
francs
of
clovis
taking
possession
of
the
gauls
julius
cÃ¦sar
army
stopped
in
its
conquest
of
england
by
the
tide
which
washed
away
his
ships
the
troops
of
king
david
the
founder
of
standing
armies
as
well
as
most
historic
scenes
recognizable
from
special
characters
of
their
own
one
day
when
the
two
friends
were
visiting
the
museum
their
reminiscences
which
had
been
thus
far
very
vague
were
brightened
like
a
landscape
at
night
by
a
flash
of
lightning
suddenly
they
the
appearance
of
paris
during
the
exposition
of
their
memory
became
more
definite
they
each
felt
individually
that
they
had
lived
there
and
under
this
strong
impression
they
also
felt
sure
that
they
had
lived
there
together
their
memory
gradually
grew
clearer
not
by
interrupted
gleams
but
rather
as
the
light
grows
stronger
from
the
beginning
of
dawn
then
they
both
remembered
as
if
by
inspiration
that
sentence
of
scripture
in
my
father
house
are
many
mansions
and
this
other
from
jesus
to
nicodemus
verily
i
say
unto
thee
except
a
man
be
born
again
he
can
not
see
the
kingdom
of
god
ye
must
be
born
again
from
that
day
they
never
doubted
their
former
earthly
existence
but
were
convinced
that
they
were
continuing
on
the
planet
mars
the
life
they
had
lived
before
they
belonged
to
the
cycle
of
the
great
minds
of
all
ages
who
know
that
human
destiny
does
not
end
with
the
present
world
but
continues
in
heaven
and
who
also
know
that
each
planet
mars
the
earth
or
any
other
is
a
star
of
heaven
the
rather
singular
fact
of
the
change
of
sex
which
seemed
to
me
to
be
very
important
was
really
without
any
weight
whatever
spero
told
me
that
souls
contrary
to
our
ideas
have
no
sex
and
that
their
destinies
are
the
same
i
also
learned
that
on
that
planet
so
much
less
material
than
our
own
organisms
have
no
resemblance
whatever
to
terrestrial
bodies
conceptions
and
births
are
effected
in
another
way
which
reminds
one
but
under
a
more
spiritual
form
of
the
fecundation
and
blooming
of
flowers
pleasure
has
no
bitterness
heavy
earthly
burdens
and
the
anguish
of
grief
are
unknown
there
everything
there
is
more
aerial
more
ethereal
and
less
material
the
martials
might
be
called
winged
sentient
living
flowers
but
in
fact
no
earthly
being
can
serve
as
comparison
to
aid
us
in
imagining
their
form
and
manner
of
existence
i
listened
to
the
translated
soul
story
almost
without
interrupting
him
for
it
seemed
to
me
all
the
time
as
if
he
would
disappear
as
he
had
come
however
remembering
my
dream
of
which
i
had
been
reminded
by
the
coincidence
of
preceding
descriptions
with
what
i
had
seen
i
could
not
keep
from
telling
my
celestial
friend
of
that
surprising
vision
and
expressing
my
surprise
at
not
having
seen
him
on
my
trip
to
mars
a
fact
which
made
me
doubt
the
reality
of
the
journey
but
he
answered
i
saw
you
perfectly
well
and
you
both
saw
and
spoke
to
me
for
it
was
i
the
tones
of
his
voice
were
so
odd
at
these
last
words
that
i
suddenly
recognized
in
them
the
melodious
voice
of
the
beautiful
martial
girl
who
had
so
enchanted
me
yes
he
answered
it
was
i
was
trying
to
make
you
know
me
but
you
were
so
bewildered
by
a
sight
which
captivated
your
mind
that
you
did
not
throw
off
your
terrestrial
sensations
you
remained
sensual
and
earthly
you
could
not
rise
high
enough
for
pure
perception
yes
it
was
i
who
held
out
my
arms
to
you
in
the
aerial
car
to
take
you
down
to
our
dwelling
when
you
suddenly
awoke
but
then
i
cried
if
you
are
that
martial
maiden
how
can
you
appear
to
me
in
spero
form
when
he
no
longer
exists
i
do
not
act
upon
your
retina
or
your
optic
nerve
he
replied
but
on
your
mental
being
and
your
brain
i
am
in
communication
with
you
now
i
influence
directly
the
cerebral
seat
of
your
sensation
my
mental
being
is
really
formless
like
yours
and
that
of
all
other
souls
but
when
i
put
myself
in
direct
relation
with
your
thought
as
at
this
moment
you
can
see
me
only
as
you
knew
me
it
is
the
same
during
your
dreams
that
is
to
say
during
more
than
a
quarter
of
your
terrestrial
life
for
twenty
years
out
of
seventy
you
see
you
hear
you
speak
you
feel
with
the
same
impression
the
same
clearness
the
same
certainty
as
during
your
normal
life
and
yet
your
eyes
are
closed
your
tympanum
is
insensible
your
mouth
is
mute
your
arms
are
stretched
out
motionless
it
is
the
same
too
in
cases
of
suggestion
in
conditions
of
hypnotic
somnambulism
you
see
me
and
hear
me
you
feel
me
too
by
your
brain
which
is
under
influence
but
i
am
no
more
in
the
form
which
you
see
than
the
rainbow
exists
in
the
presence
of
the
eyes
that
look
at
it
could
you
also
appear
to
me
in
your
martial
form
no
at
least
not
unless
you
were
really
transported
in
spirit
to
that
planet
there
would
then
be
quite
a
different
mode
of
communication
in
our
conversation
here
everything
is
subjective
to
you
the
elements
of
my
martial
form
do
not
exist
in
the
terrestrial
atmosphere
and
your
brain
could
not
imagine
them
you
can
see
me
only
through
the
medium
of
your
dream
but
as
soon
as
you
try
to
analyze
its
details
it
will
vanish
away
you
did
not
see
us
exactly
as
we
are
because
your
mind
can
judge
only
by
your
earthly
eyes
which
are
not
sensitive
to
all
our
radiations
and
because
you
do
not
possess
all
our
senses
i
must
confess
i
answered
that
i
can
not
understand
your
martial
beings
as
having
six
limbs
if
these
forms
were
not
so
graceful
they
would
have
seemed
frightful
to
you
the
organisms
in
each
world
are
most
appropriate
to
its
conditions
of
existence
i
acknowledge
on
my
part
that
to
the
inhabitants
of
mars
the
apollo
belvedere
and
the
venus
de
mÃ©dicis
are
actual
monstrosities
on
account
of
their
animal
heaviness
illustration
everything
with
us
is
exquisitely
light
although
our
planet
is
much
smaller
than
yours
yet
the
beings
are
larger
than
here
because
the
weight
is
less
and
beings
can
grow
taller
without
being
impeded
by
their
weight
or
imperilling
their
stability
they
are
larger
and
lighter
because
the
constructive
materials
of
that
planet
are
of
very
little
density
what
would
have
happened
on
the
earth
if
the
weight
had
not
been
so
great
has
happened
there
the
winged
species
would
have
ruled
over
the
world
instead
of
dwindling
away
in
impossibility
of
development
on
mars
organic
development
is
effected
in
the
series
of
winged
species
martial
humanity
is
indeed
a
race
of
sextupedal
origin
but
it
is
actually
bipedal
bimanous
and
what
might
be
called
since
these
beings
have
two
wings
illustration
their
manner
of
life
is
totally
different
from
terrestrial
life
in
the
first
place
because
they
live
in
the
air
and
on
aerial
plants
as
much
as
they
do
on
the
surface
of
the
ground
and
further
because
they
do
not
eat
the
atmosphere
being
nutritive
passions
are
not
the
same
there
murder
is
unknown
humanity
being
without
material
needs
has
never
lived
there
even
in
the
primitive
ages
in
the
barbarity
of
rapine
and
war
the
ideas
and
feelings
of
the
inhabitants
of
mars
are
of
an
entirely
intellectual
nature
nevertheless
in
dwelling
on
this
planet
analogies
at
least
if
not
resemblances
are
to
be
found
thus
there
is
a
succession
of
night
and
day
there
as
on
the
earth
which
does
not
differ
essentially
from
what
you
have
the
duration
of
night
and
day
being
hours
minutes
seconds
as
there
are
of
these
days
in
a
martial
year
we
have
more
time
than
you
for
our
work
our
investigations
and
our
enjoyments
our
seasons
too
are
almost
twice
as
long
as
yours
but
they
have
the
same
intensity
the
climates
are
not
very
different
a
country
in
mars
on
the
shores
of
the
equatorial
sea
differs
less
from
the
climate
of
france
than
lapland
differs
from
nubia
an
inhabitant
of
the
earth
would
not
feel
so
very
foreign
the
greatest
difference
between
the
two
worlds
certainly
consists
in
the
great
superiority
of
their
humanity
over
yours
this
superiority
is
principally
due
to
the
great
progress
realized
by
astronomical
science
and
to
the
universal
propagation
among
the
inhabitants
of
that
planet
of
that
science
without
which
one
has
but
false
ideas
of
life
of
creation
and
of
destiny
we
are
very
much
favored
as
much
by
the
acuteness
of
our
senses
as
by
the
purity
of
our
skies
there
is
much
less
water
on
mars
than
on
the
earth
and
fewer
clouds
the
sky
there
is
almost
always
fair
especially
in
the
temperate
zone
but
still
you
often
have
inundations
yes
and
quite
recently
your
telescopes
have
noticed
one
along
the
shores
of
a
sea
to
which
your
colleagues
have
given
a
name
which
will
always
be
dear
to
me
even
when
far
from
the
earth
the
greater
part
of
our
shores
are
beaches
level
plains
we
have
few
mountains
and
our
seas
are
not
deep
the
inhabitants
make
use
of
these
overflows
for
irrigating
great
stretches
of
country
they
have
straightened
and
enlarged
the
watercourses
and
made
them
like
canals
and
have
constructed
a
network
of
immense
canals
all
over
the
continents
the
continents
themselves
are
not
bristling
all
over
with
alpine
or
himalayan
upheavals
like
those
of
the
terrestrial
globe
but
are
crossed
in
all
directions
by
canals
which
connect
all
the
seas
with
one
another
and
by
streams
made
to
resemble
canals
formerly
there
was
as
much
water
on
mars
in
proportion
to
the
size
of
the
planet
as
on
the
earth
gradually
from
age
to
age
a
part
of
the
sank
into
the
depths
of
the
soil
and
did
not
return
to
the
surface
it
combined
itself
chemically
with
the
rocks
and
was
withdrawn
from
atmospheric
circulation
then
too
from
age
to
age
rains
snows
and
winds
winter
frosts
and
summer
droughts
have
disintegrated
the
mountains
and
the
watercourses
bringing
fragments
to
the
have
gradually
raised
their
beds
we
have
no
more
large
oceans
or
deep
seas
nothing
but
inland
waters
many
straits
gulfs
and
seas
analogous
to
the
channel
the
red
sea
the
adriatic
the
baltic
and
the
caspian
pleasant
shores
quiet
harbors
large
lakes
and
streams
aerial
rather
than
aquatic
fleets
an
almost
always
clear
sky
especially
in
the
morning
there
are
no
mornings
on
earth
so
luminous
as
ours
the
meteorological
system
differs
materially
from
that
of
the
earth
because
the
atmosphere
being
more
rarified
the
waters
which
move
over
the
surface
evaporate
more
easily
and
then
because
in
condensing
again
instead
of
forming
clouds
that
last
they
pass
almost
without
transition
from
the
gaseous
to
the
liquid
state
there
are
few
clouds
and
few
fogs
astronomy
is
cultivated
there
on
account
of
the
clearness
of
the
heavens
we
have
two
satellites
whose
courses
would
appear
strange
to
earthly
astronomers
for
while
one
of
them
gives
us
months
of
a
hundred
and
thirty
hours
or
five
martial
days
plus
eight
hours
the
other
by
a
combination
of
its
motion
with
the
daily
rotation
of
the
planet
rises
in
the
occident
and
sets
in
the
orient
crossing
the
sky
from
west
to
east
in
five
hours
and
a
half
and
passing
from
one
phase
to
the
other
in
less
than
three
hours
that
spectacle
is
unique
in
the
whole
solar
system
and
has
done
much
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
inhabitants
to
the
study
of
the
sky
besides
that
we
have
eclipses
of
the
moon
almost
every
day
but
never
total
eclipses
of
the
sun
because
our
satellites
are
too
small
the
earth
looks
to
us
as
venus
looks
to
you
to
us
it
is
the
morning
and
evening
star
and
in
old
times
before
the
invention
of
optical
instruments
which
have
taught
us
that
it
is
a
planet
dwelt
upon
like
ours
but
by
an
inferior
race
our
ancestors
worshipped
it
as
a
tutelary
divinity
all
worlds
have
a
mythology
during
their
centuries
of
infancy
and
this
mythology
has
for
its
origin
its
foundation
and
its
object
the
appearance
of
the
celestial
bodies
sometimes
the
earth
accompanied
by
the
moon
passes
between
us
and
the
sun
and
projects
itself
upon
its
disk
like
a
little
black
spot
attended
by
a
still
smaller
one
every
one
there
follows
these
celestial
phenomena
with
curiosity
our
newspapers
think
more
of
science
than
of
theatres
literary
fancies
or
political
quarrels
the
sun
looks
smaller
to
us
and
we
receive
a
little
less
light
and
heat
from
it
our
more
sensitive
eyes
see
better
than
yours
the
temperature
is
a
little
higher
how
can
that
be
said
i
you
are
farther
from
the
sun
yet
are
warmer
than
we
chamounix
is
a
little
farther
from
noonday
sun
than
mont
blanc
he
answered
the
distance
from
the
sun
does
not
alone
regulate
the
temperature
you
must
also
take
into
account
the
constitution
of
the
atmosphere
our
polar
ice
melts
under
our
summer
sun
more
entirely
than
yours
what
lands
in
mars
are
most
populous
there
is
very
little
except
the
polar
regions
where
from
the
earth
you
see
the
snow
and
ice
melt
every
spring
which
is
uninhabited
the
population
of
the
temperate
regions
is
very
dense
but
in
the
equatorial
lands
it
is
more
so
the
population
there
is
as
dense
as
in
china
and
especially
the
notwithstanding
the
inundations
a
large
number
of
cities
are
built
almost
on
the
water
suspended
in
the
air
in
some
way
above
the
overflows
which
are
calculated
and
expected
beforehand
are
your
arts
and
your
industries
like
ours
have
you
railways
steamships
the
telegraph
and
the
telephone
it
is
all
quite
different
we
have
never
had
either
steam
or
railways
because
we
have
always
known
of
electricity
and
aerial
navigation
is
natural
to
us
our
fleets
are
moved
by
electricity
and
are
more
aerial
than
aquatic
we
live
principally
in
the
air
and
have
no
homes
of
stone
iron
or
wood
we
do
not
experience
the
rigors
of
winter
because
no
one
stays
exposed
to
them
those
who
do
not
dwell
in
the
equatorial
countries
emigrate
every
autumn
just
as
your
birds
do
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
you
to
form
an
exact
idea
of
our
manner
of
life
are
there
many
human
beings
on
mars
who
have
already
lived
on
the
earth
no
among
the
inhabitants
of
your
planet
the
greater
part
are
either
ignorant
sceptical
or
indifferent
and
are
unprepared
for
the
spiritual
life
they
are
attached
to
the
earth
and
their
attachment
lasts
for
a
long
time
many
souls
sleep
completely
those
which
act
live
and
aspire
to
know
the
truth
are
the
only
ones
called
to
conscious
immortality
the
only
ones
whom
the
interests
and
who
are
capable
of
understanding
it
these
souls
can
leave
the
earth
and
live
in
other
lands
many
come
and
live
for
a
while
on
mars
the
first
stage
of
an
journey
going
from
the
sun
or
on
venus
the
first
abode
going
the
other
way
but
venus
is
a
world
analogous
to
the
earth
and
still
less
favored
on
account
of
its
too
rapid
seasons
which
oblige
its
inhabitants
to
suffer
the
most
sudden
changes
of
temperature
certain
spirits
wing
their
way
at
once
to
the
starry
regions
as
you
know
space
has
no
existence
to
sum
up
justice
reigns
in
the
moral
world
as
equilibrium
does
in
the
physical
world
and
the
destiny
of
souls
is
but
the
perpetual
result
of
their
capabilities
their
aspirations
and
consequently
of
the
uranian
way
is
open
to
all
but
the
soul
becomes
truly
uranian
only
when
it
has
entirely
shaken
off
the
weight
of
material
life
the
day
will
come
even
on
your
planet
when
there
will
be
no
other
belief
no
other
religion
than
the
knowledge
of
the
universe
and
the
certainty
of
immortality
in
its
infinite
regions
in
its
eternal
domain
what
a
strange
thing
said
i
that
no
one
on
the
earth
should
know
these
sublime
truths
no
one
looks
at
the
sky
we
live
as
though
our
little
isle
alone
existed
in
the
universe
terrestrial
humanity
is
young
answered
spero
you
must
not
despair
it
is
a
child
and
still
in
primitive
ignorance
it
is
amused
at
trifles
and
obeys
masters
of
its
own
giving
you
like
to
divide
yourselves
into
nations
to
trick
yourselves
out
in
national
costumes
and
to
exterminate
each
other
to
music
then
you
raise
statues
to
those
who
have
led
you
to
butchery
you
ruin
yourselves
you
commit
suicide
and
yet
you
can
not
live
without
wresting
your
daily
bread
from
the
earth
that
is
a
sad
condition
of
things
but
one
which
fully
satisfies
the
greater
part
of
the
dwellers
on
your
planet
if
some
of
them
with
higher
aspirations
think
occasionally
of
problems
of
the
higher
order
of
the
nature
of
the
soul
or
the
existence
of
god
the
result
has
been
no
better
because
they
have
put
their
souls
outside
of
nature
and
have
invented
strange
horrible
gods
who
never
existed
except
in
their
perverted
imaginations
and
in
whose
name
they
have
committed
all
kinds
of
outrages
against
the
human
conscience
have
blessed
all
crimes
and
bound
weak
minds
in
a
slavery
from
which
it
will
be
difficult
for
them
to
escape
the
lowest
animal
on
mars
is
better
finer
gentler
more
intelligent
and
greater
than
the
god
of
the
armies
of
david
constantine
charlemagne
and
all
your
crowned
assassins
there
is
therefore
nothing
surprising
in
the
coarseness
and
stupidity
of
terrestrial
humanity
but
the
law
of
progress
governs
the
world
you
are
more
advanced
than
at
the
period
of
your
ancestors
of
the
stone
age
whose
wretched
existence
was
spent
in
fighting
night
and
day
with
ferocious
beasts
in
a
few
thousands
of
years
you
will
be
more
advanced
than
you
are
now
then
urania
will
reign
in
your
hearts
it
would
require
a
brutal
material
fact
to
teach
and
convince
human
beings
if
for
instance
we
could
some
day
enter
into
communication
with
the
neighboring
world
which
you
inhabit
not
into
physical
communication
with
one
isolated
person
of
it
as
i
am
now
doing
but
with
the
planet
itself
by
hundreds
and
thousands
of
witnesses
that
would
be
a
gigantic
stride
towards
progress
you
could
do
it
now
if
you
chose
for
we
martials
are
all
prepared
for
it
and
have
even
tried
it
many
times
but
you
have
never
replied
to
us
solar
reflections
showing
geometrical
figures
on
our
vast
plains
prove
to
you
that
we
exist
you
could
reply
to
us
by
like
figures
also
displayed
on
your
plains
either
during
the
day
by
the
sun
or
during
the
night
by
the
electric
light
but
you
never
even
think
of
it
and
if
some
one
should
propose
to
try
it
your
courts
would
interpose
to
prevent
it
for
the
very
idea
is
immeasurably
too
high
for
the
general
approval
of
the
denizens
of
your
planet
what
do
your
scientific
assemblies
work
for
the
preservation
of
the
past
to
what
do
your
political
assemblies
direct
their
attention
increasing
the
taxes
in
the
land
of
the
blind
men
are
kings
but
you
must
not
utterly
despair
progress
bears
you
on
in
spite
of
yourselves
one
of
these
days
too
you
will
realize
that
you
are
citizens
of
the
sky
then
you
will
live
in
the
light
in
knowledge
in
the
mind
true
world
while
the
inhabitant
of
mars
was
teaching
me
the
principal
characteristics
of
his
new
country
the
terrestrial
globe
had
turned
towards
the
east
the
horizon
had
sunk
lower
and
the
moon
had
gradually
risen
in
the
sky
which
she
was
illuminating
with
her
radiance
suddenly
chancing
to
lower
my
eyes
to
where
spero
sat
i
could
not
repress
a
start
of
surprise
the
moonlight
was
streaming
over
him
as
it
did
over
me
and
yet
although
my
body
cast
a
shadow
on
the
parapet
his
figure
was
shadowless
i
arose
abruptly
to
assure
myself
of
this
fact
i
turned
about
at
once
and
stretched
out
my
hand
to
touch
his
shoulder
watching
the
shadow
of
my
gesture
on
the
parapet
but
my
visitor
had
instantly
disappeared
i
was
absolutely
alone
on
the
silent
tower
my
very
dark
shadow
was
thrown
out
sharply
on
the
parapet
the
moon
was
brilliant
the
village
was
sleeping
at
my
feet
the
air
was
mild
and
very
still
and
yet
i
thought
i
heard
footsteps
i
listened
and
indeed
did
hear
rather
heavy
footsteps
coming
towards
me
some
one
was
evidently
climbing
the
monsieur
has
not
gone
down
yet
said
the
custodian
coming
up
to
the
top
i
was
waiting
to
lock
the
doors
and
thought
the
experiments
must
be
over
illustration
illustration
iv
the
fixed
point
in
the
universe
the
memory
of
urania
and
the
celestial
journey
on
which
she
had
borne
me
away
the
truths
she
had
made
me
realize
spero
history
his
trials
in
his
pursuit
of
the
absolute
his
apparition
his
story
of
another
world
still
haunted
me
and
kept
the
same
problems
partly
solved
partly
veiled
in
the
uncertainty
of
our
knowledge
incessantly
before
my
mind
i
felt
that
i
had
gradually
risen
to
a
perception
of
the
truth
and
that
the
visible
universe
was
really
but
an
appearance
which
we
must
pass
through
in
order
to
reach
reality
the
testimony
of
our
senses
is
but
an
illusion
the
earth
is
not
what
it
seems
to
be
nature
is
not
what
we
think
in
the
physical
universe
itself
where
is
the
fixed
point
upon
which
material
creation
is
in
equilibrium
the
natural
and
direct
impression
given
by
the
observation
of
nature
is
that
we
inhabit
a
solid
stable
earth
fixed
in
the
centre
of
the
universe
it
took
long
centuries
of
study
and
a
great
deal
of
boldness
to
free
ourselves
from
that
natural
conviction
and
to
realize
that
the
world
we
are
on
is
isolated
in
space
without
any
support
whatever
in
rapid
motion
on
itself
and
around
the
sun
but
to
the
ages
before
scientific
analysis
to
primitive
peoples
and
even
to
three
quarters
of
the
human
race
our
feet
are
resting
on
a
solid
earth
which
is
fixed
at
the
base
of
the
universe
and
whose
foundations
are
supposed
to
extend
into
the
depths
of
the
infinite
and
yet
from
the
time
when
it
was
first
realized
that
it
is
the
same
sun
which
rises
and
sets
every
day
that
it
is
the
same
moon
the
same
stars
the
same
constellations
which
revolve
about
us
those
very
facts
forced
one
to
admit
with
absolute
certainty
that
there
must
be
empty
space
underneath
the
earth
to
let
the
stars
of
the
firmament
pass
from
their
setting
to
their
rising
this
first
recognition
was
a
the
admission
of
the
earth
isolation
in
space
was
astronomy
first
triumph
it
was
the
first
step
and
indeed
the
most
difficult
one
think
of
it
to
give
up
the
foundations
of
the
earth
such
an
idea
would
never
have
sprung
from
any
brain
without
the
study
of
the
stars
or
indeed
without
the
transparency
of
the
atmosphere
under
a
perpetually
cloudy
sky
human
thoughts
would
have
remained
fixed
on
terrestrial
ground
like
the
oyster
to
the
rock
the
earth
once
isolated
in
space
the
first
step
was
taken
before
this
revolution
whose
philosophical
bearing
equals
its
scientific
value
all
manner
of
shapes
had
been
imagined
for
our
sublunary
in
the
first
place
the
earth
was
thought
to
be
an
island
emerging
from
a
boundless
ocean
the
island
having
infinite
roots
then
the
earth
with
its
seas
was
supposed
to
be
a
flat
circular
disk
all
around
which
rested
the
vault
of
the
firmament
later
cubic
cylindrical
polyhedric
forms
were
imagined
but
still
the
progress
of
navigation
tended
to
reveal
its
spherical
nature
and
when
its
isolation
with
its
incontestable
proofs
was
recognized
this
sphericity
was
admitted
as
a
natural
corollary
of
that
isolation
and
of
the
circular
motion
of
the
celestial
spheres
around
the
supposed
central
globe
the
terrestrial
globe
being
from
that
time
recognized
as
isolated
to
move
it
was
no
longer
difficult
formerly
when
the
sky
was
looked
upon
as
a
dome
crowning
the
massive
and
unlimited
earth
the
very
idea
of
supposing
it
to
be
in
motion
would
have
been
not
only
absurd
but
untenable
but
from
the
time
that
we
could
see
it
in
our
minds
placed
like
a
globe
in
the
centre
of
celestial
motion
the
idea
of
imagining
that
perhaps
this
globe
could
revolve
on
itself
so
as
to
avoid
obliging
the
whole
sky
and
the
immense
universe
to
perform
this
daily
task
might
come
naturally
into
a
thinker
mind
and
indeed
we
see
the
hypothesis
of
the
daily
rotation
of
the
terrestrial
sphere
coming
to
light
in
ancient
civilizations
among
the
greeks
the
egyptians
the
indians
etc
it
is
sufficient
to
read
a
few
chapters
of
ptolemy
plutarch
or
for
an
account
of
these
conjectures
but
this
new
hypothesis
although
it
had
been
prepared
for
by
the
first
one
was
none
the
less
bold
and
contrary
to
the
feelings
inspired
by
the
direct
contemplation
of
nature
thoughtful
mankind
was
obliged
to
wait
until
the
sixteenth
century
or
to
speak
more
correctly
until
the
seventeenth
century
to
learn
our
planet
true
position
in
the
universe
and
to
by
supported
proofs
that
it
has
a
double
movement
daily
about
itself
and
yearly
about
the
sun
from
that
time
only
from
the
time
of
copernicus
galileo
kepler
and
newton
has
real
astronomy
existed
and
yet
again
that
was
but
a
beginning
for
the
great
remodeller
of
the
world
system
copernicus
himself
had
no
suspicion
of
the
other
motions
or
of
the
distances
of
the
stars
it
is
only
in
our
own
century
that
the
first
measurements
of
the
distances
of
the
stars
could
be
made
and
it
is
only
in
our
day
that
sidereal
discoveries
have
afforded
us
the
necessary
data
by
which
we
might
endeavor
to
account
for
the
forces
which
maintain
the
equilibrium
of
creation
the
ancient
idea
of
endless
roots
attributed
to
the
earth
evidently
left
much
to
be
desired
to
minds
anxious
to
go
to
the
bottom
of
things
it
is
absolutely
impossible
for
us
to
conceive
of
a
material
pillar
as
thick
and
as
wide
as
you
like
of
the
diameter
of
the
earth
for
example
sinking
down
into
the
infinite
just
as
one
can
not
admit
the
real
existence
of
a
stick
which
should
have
but
one
end
no
matter
how
far
our
mind
goes
down
towards
the
base
of
such
a
material
pillar
there
is
a
point
where
it
can
see
the
end
of
it
the
difficulty
had
been
obviated
by
materializing
the
celestial
sphere
and
putting
the
earth
inside
it
occupying
all
its
lower
portion
but
in
the
first
place
it
became
difficult
to
adjust
the
motion
of
the
stars
and
on
the
other
hand
this
material
universe
itself
enclosed
in
an
immense
crystal
globe
was
held
up
by
nothing
since
the
infinite
must
extend
all
around
beneath
it
as
well
as
above
investigating
minds
were
at
first
obliged
to
free
themselves
from
the
vulgar
idea
of
weight
isolated
in
space
like
a
child
balloon
floating
in
the
air
and
more
absolutely
too
for
the
balloon
is
carried
by
aerial
waves
while
worlds
gravitate
in
the
void
the
earth
is
a
toy
for
the
invisible
cosmic
forces
which
it
obeys
a
real
sensitive
to
the
faintest
breath
besides
we
can
easily
judge
of
it
by
looking
at
the
same
time
at
the
whole
of
the
principal
motions
of
the
earth
by
which
it
is
moved
perhaps
they
will
help
us
to
find
that
fixed
point
which
our
philosophical
ambition
asks
for
thrown
around
the
sun
at
a
distance
of
leagues
and
making
at
this
distance
its
annual
revolution
around
the
luminous
star
it
consequently
moves
at
the
rate
of
leagues
per
day
that
is
leagues
an
hour
or
metres
per
second
this
speed
is
eleven
hundred
times
more
rapid
than
an
express
train
going
at
the
rate
of
a
hundred
kilometres
an
hour
it
is
a
ball
going
with
a
rapidity
times
greater
than
that
of
a
bomb
always
hurrying
on
but
never
reaching
its
goal
in
days
hours
minutes
and
seconds
the
terrestrial
projectile
has
returned
to
the
same
point
of
its
orbit
relative
to
the
sun
and
continues
its
flight
the
sun
on
its
part
is
moving
in
space
following
a
line
oblique
to
the
plane
of
the
earth
annual
motion
a
line
drawn
towards
the
constellation
of
hercules
the
result
is
that
instead
of
describing
an
exact
circle
the
earth
describes
a
spiral
and
has
never
passed
over
the
same
road
twice
in
its
existence
to
its
motion
of
annual
revolution
around
the
sun
there
is
added
perpetually
as
a
second
motion
that
of
the
sun
itself
which
draws
it
with
all
the
solar
system
into
an
oblique
descent
towards
the
constellation
of
hercules
during
all
this
time
our
little
globe
pirouettes
around
itself
every
hours
and
gives
us
the
daily
succession
of
days
and
nights
diurnal
rotation
third
motion
it
does
not
turn
upright
upon
itself
like
a
top
which
would
be
vertical
on
a
table
but
is
inclined
as
everybody
knows
by
this
inclination
too
is
not
always
the
same
it
varies
from
year
to
year
from
age
to
age
oscillating
slowly
by
secular
periods
that
is
a
fourth
kind
of
motion
the
orbit
in
which
our
planet
yearly
travels
around
the
sun
is
not
circular
but
elliptical
this
ellipse
itself
also
varies
from
year
to
year
and
from
century
to
century
sometimes
it
approaches
the
circumference
of
a
circle
sometimes
it
lengthens
out
to
a
great
eccentricity
it
is
like
an
elastic
ring
which
can
be
bent
more
or
less
out
of
shape
fifth
complication
in
the
earth
motion
this
ellipse
itself
is
not
fixed
in
space
but
revolves
in
its
own
plane
in
a
period
of
years
the
perihelion
which
at
the
beginning
of
our
era
was
at
degrees
of
longitude
starting
from
the
vernal
equinox
is
now
at
degrees
this
secular
displacement
of
the
line
of
the
apsides
brings
a
sixth
complication
to
the
motion
of
our
here
is
a
seventh
we
said
just
now
that
our
globe
axis
of
rotation
is
inclined
and
everybody
knows
that
the
imaginary
prolongation
of
this
axis
points
towards
the
polar
star
this
axis
itself
is
not
fixed
it
revolves
in
years
keeping
its
inclination
of
to
degrees
so
that
its
prolongation
describes
a
circle
of
to
degrees
in
diameter
according
to
the
epoch
on
the
celestial
sphere
around
the
pole
of
the
ecliptic
it
is
in
consequence
of
this
displacement
of
the
pole
that
vega
in
twelve
thousand
years
will
again
become
the
polar
star
as
she
was
fourteen
thousand
years
ago
seventh
kind
of
movement
an
eighth
motion
due
to
the
action
of
the
moon
on
the
equatorial
swelling
of
the
earth
that
of
nutation
causes
the
pole
of
the
equator
to
describe
a
small
ellipse
in
eighteen
years
and
eight
months
a
ninth
due
also
to
the
attraction
of
our
satellite
incessantly
changes
the
position
of
the
globe
centre
of
gravity
and
the
place
in
space
when
the
moon
is
in
front
of
us
she
accelerates
the
speed
of
the
globe
when
she
is
behind
she
retards
us
on
the
contrary
like
a
a
monthly
complication
which
is
added
to
all
the
others
when
the
earth
passes
between
the
sun
and
jupiter
the
attraction
of
the
latter
in
spite
of
its
distance
of
leagues
makes
it
deviate
by
sec
from
its
absolute
orbit
the
attraction
of
venus
makes
it
deviate
sec
the
other
way
saturn
and
mars
also
act
upon
it
but
more
feebly
these
are
exterior
disturbances
which
make
up
a
tenth
kind
of
correction
to
add
to
the
motion
of
our
celestial
barque
the
whole
of
the
planets
weigh
about
one
seven
hundredth
part
of
the
weight
of
the
sun
the
centre
of
gravity
around
which
the
earth
annually
turns
is
not
in
the
very
centre
of
the
sun
but
far
from
the
centre
and
often
even
outside
of
the
solar
globe
now
absolutely
speaking
the
earth
does
not
turn
around
the
sun
but
the
two
heavenly
bodies
sun
and
earth
turn
about
their
common
centre
of
gravity
thus
the
centre
of
our
planet
annual
motion
is
constantly
changing
place
and
we
may
add
this
eleventh
complication
to
the
others
we
might
even
add
many
others
to
these
but
the
preceding
ones
are
enough
to
make
the
degree
of
lightness
and
delicacy
of
our
floating
island
appreciated
subject
as
we
have
seen
to
all
the
fluctuations
of
celestial
influences
mathematical
analysis
goes
very
far
beyond
this
summary
statement
it
has
found
that
the
moon
alone
which
seems
to
turn
so
peacefully
about
us
has
more
than
sixty
distinct
motions
the
expression
is
therefore
not
exaggerated
our
planet
is
but
the
plaything
of
the
cosmic
forces
which
accompany
it
in
the
meadows
of
the
sky
and
it
is
the
same
with
everything
existing
in
the
universe
matter
is
meekly
obedient
to
force
where
then
is
the
fixed
point
which
we
desire
for
our
support
our
planet
then
formerly
supposed
to
be
at
the
base
of
the
universe
is
in
fact
kept
up
at
a
distance
by
the
sun
which
makes
the
earth
gravitate
about
it
with
a
speed
corresponding
to
that
distance
this
speed
caused
by
the
solar
mass
itself
keeps
our
planet
at
the
same
mean
distance
from
the
central
star
a
lesser
speed
would
make
the
weight
predominate
and
would
lead
to
the
earth
falling
into
the
sun
a
greater
speed
on
the
contrary
would
progressively
and
infinitely
send
our
planet
away
from
its
focus
but
at
the
speed
resulting
from
gravitation
our
wandering
home
remains
suspended
in
permanent
stability
just
as
the
moon
is
upheld
in
space
by
the
force
of
the
earth
gravity
which
makes
it
circulate
about
the
earth
with
the
speed
requisite
to
maintain
it
constantly
at
the
same
mean
distance
the
earth
and
the
moon
thus
form
a
planetary
couple
in
space
which
sustain
each
other
in
perpetual
equilibrium
under
the
supreme
domination
of
solar
attraction
if
the
earth
existed
alone
in
the
universe
it
would
be
forever
motionless
in
the
void
wherever
it
had
been
placed
with
no
power
to
descend
or
rise
or
change
its
position
in
any
way
whatsoever
these
very
expressions
to
rise
descend
left
or
right
having
no
absolute
sense
whatever
if
this
same
earth
while
existing
alone
had
received
any
impetus
whatever
had
been
thrown
with
any
speed
in
any
direction
it
would
have
whirled
away
forever
in
a
straight
line
in
that
direction
never
being
able
to
stop
or
to
slacken
its
pace
or
change
its
motion
it
would
have
been
the
same
thing
if
the
moon
had
existed
alone
with
it
they
would
both
have
turned
about
their
common
centre
of
gravity
fulfilling
their
destiny
in
the
same
place
in
space
flying
together
following
the
direction
in
which
they
had
been
thrown
the
sun
existing
and
being
the
centre
of
its
system
the
earth
all
the
planets
and
their
satellites
are
dependent
upon
it
and
to
it
their
destiny
is
irrevocably
bound
is
the
fixed
point
that
we
are
seeking
the
solid
base
which
we
seem
to
need
to
insure
the
stability
of
the
universe
to
be
found
in
that
colossal
and
heavy
globe
the
sun
assuredly
not
since
the
sun
itself
is
not
in
repose
for
it
is
bearing
us
and
all
its
system
away
towards
the
constellation
of
hercules
does
our
sun
gravitate
around
an
immense
sun
whose
attraction
extends
to
it
and
controls
its
destinies
as
it
controls
that
of
the
planets
do
investigations
in
sidereal
astronomy
lead
us
to
believe
that
a
star
of
such
magnitude
can
exist
in
a
direction
situated
at
right
angles
with
our
course
towards
hercules
no
our
sun
is
influenced
by
sidereal
attraction
but
no
one
star
appears
to
overpower
all
the
others
and
reign
sovereign
over
our
central
star
although
it
may
be
perfectly
admissible
or
rather
certain
that
the
sun
nearest
to
ours
the
star
alpha
centauri
and
our
own
sun
feel
their
mutual
attraction
although
this
star
may
be
situated
at
about
degrees
from
our
tangent
towards
hercules
and
more
than
that
in
the
plane
of
the
principal
stars
passing
by
perseus
capella
vega
aldebaran
and
the
southern
cross
and
although
the
proper
motion
of
this
neighboring
sun
may
be
turned
sensibly
in
the
opposite
direction
from
ours
yet
we
could
not
consider
these
two
systems
as
forming
one
couple
analogous
to
that
of
the
double
stars
in
the
first
place
because
all
the
known
systems
are
composed
of
stars
much
nearer
to
each
other
and
then
because
in
the
immensity
of
the
orbit
described
according
to
this
hypothesis
the
attraction
of
the
neighboring
stars
could
not
be
considered
as
remaining
without
influence
and
lastly
because
the
actual
rates
of
speed
with
which
these
two
suns
are
moved
are
much
less
great
than
those
which
would
result
from
their
mutual
attraction
the
little
constellation
of
perseus
especially
might
very
well
exert
a
more
powerful
action
than
that
of
the
pleiades
or
than
any
other
group
of
stars
and
be
the
fixed
point
the
centre
of
gravity
of
the
motions
of
our
sun
of
alpha
centauri
and
the
neighboring
stars
inasmuch
as
the
cluster
of
perseus
is
not
only
at
right
angles
with
the
tangent
of
our
movement
towards
hercules
but
also
in
the
great
circle
of
the
principal
stars
and
precisely
at
the
intersection
of
this
circle
with
the
milky
way
but
here
another
factor
comes
in
of
more
importance
than
all
the
preceding
ones
this
milky
way
with
its
eighteen
millions
of
suns
of
which
it
would
assuredly
be
audacious
to
seek
the
centre
of
gravity
but
what
is
the
whole
entire
milky
way
after
all
compared
with
the
milliards
of
stars
which
our
mind
contemplates
in
the
bosom
of
the
sidereal
universe
is
not
this
milky
way
itself
moving
like
an
archipelago
of
floating
islands
is
not
every
resolvable
nebula
each
cluster
of
stars
a
milky
way
in
motion
under
the
action
of
the
gravitation
of
other
universes
which
call
to
it
and
appeal
to
it
through
the
infinite
night
our
thoughts
are
transported
from
star
to
star
from
system
to
system
from
region
to
region
in
the
presence
of
unfathomable
grandeurs
in
sight
of
celestial
motions
whose
speed
we
are
but
just
beginning
properly
to
value
but
which
already
surpasses
all
conception
the
proper
annual
motion
of
the
sun
alpha
centauri
exceeds
millions
of
leagues
per
year
the
proper
motion
of
the
of
cygnus
second
sun
in
the
order
of
distances
is
equivalent
to
millions
of
leagues
per
year
or
about
one
million
of
leagues
per
day
the
star
alpha
cygni
comes
to
us
in
a
direct
line
at
a
speed
of
millions
of
leagues
per
year
the
proper
motion
of
the
star
of
groombridge
catalogue
rises
to
millions
of
leagues
per
year
which
represents
seven
millions
of
leagues
per
day
kilometres
per
hour
or
metres
per
second
these
are
minimum
estimates
inasmuch
as
we
certainly
do
not
see
perpendicularly
but
obliquely
the
stellar
displacements
thus
measured
what
projectiles
they
are
suns
thousands
and
millions
of
times
heavier
than
the
earth
launched
through
the
unfathomable
void
with
giddy
rates
of
speed
revolving
in
immensity
under
the
influence
of
the
gravitation
of
all
the
stars
of
the
universe
and
these
millions
and
thousand
millions
of
suns
planets
clusters
of
stars
nebulÃ¦
worlds
in
their
infancy
worlds
near
their
end
rush
with
equal
velocity
towards
goals
of
which
they
are
ignorant
with
an
energy
and
intensity
of
action
before
which
gunpowder
and
dynamite
are
like
the
breath
of
sleeping
babes
and
thus
everything
hurries
on
through
all
eternity
perhaps
without
being
able
ever
to
reach
the
unexisting
limits
of
infinity
motion
activity
light
life
everywhere
happily
so
without
doubt
if
all
these
innumerable
suns
planets
earths
moons
comets
were
fixed
and
immovable
petrified
kings
in
their
eternal
tombs
how
much
more
formidable
but
also
more
mournful
would
be
the
aspect
of
such
a
universe
can
you
imagine
the
whole
creation
stopped
benumbed
mummified
is
not
such
an
idea
unbearable
is
there
not
something
funereal
about
it
what
causes
these
motions
what
maintains
them
what
regulates
them
universal
gravitation
invisible
force
which
the
visible
universe
what
we
call
matter
obeys
a
body
attracted
from
infinity
by
the
earth
would
attain
a
velocity
of
metres
per
second
just
as
a
body
thrown
from
the
earth
with
that
speed
would
never
fall
again
a
body
attracted
by
the
sun
from
the
infinite
would
attain
a
speed
of
metres
and
a
body
thrown
by
the
sun
with
that
swiftness
would
never
return
to
its
point
of
departure
clusters
of
stars
may
give
us
velocities
much
more
remarkable
still
but
which
are
explained
by
the
theory
of
gravitation
a
glance
at
a
map
of
the
proper
motions
of
the
stars
is
enough
to
make
one
understand
the
variety
and
grandeur
of
these
motions
thus
the
stars
the
suns
the
planets
the
worlds
the
the
meteoric
stones
in
short
all
the
bodies
which
constitute
this
vast
universe
rest
not
on
solid
bases
as
the
childish
and
primitive
conception
of
our
fathers
seemed
to
require
but
invisible
and
immaterial
which
govern
their
motions
these
milliards
of
celestial
bodies
have
their
respective
movements
for
the
purpose
of
stability
and
mutually
lean
upon
each
other
across
the
void
which
separates
them
the
mind
which
could
eliminate
time
and
space
would
see
the
earth
the
planets
the
sun
the
stars
rain
down
from
a
limitless
sky
in
all
imaginable
directions
like
the
drops
carried
away
by
the
whirlwinds
of
a
gigantic
tempest
and
drawn
not
by
a
common
basis
but
by
the
attraction
of
each
and
all
each
one
of
these
cosmic
drops
each
one
of
these
worlds
each
one
of
these
suns
is
whirled
away
at
a
speed
so
rapid
that
the
flight
of
is
but
rest
in
comparison
it
is
not
one
hundred
nor
five
hundred
nor
a
thousand
metres
per
second
it
is
ten
thousand
twenty
fifty
a
hundred
and
even
two
or
three
hundred
thousand
metres
how
is
it
that
there
are
no
meetings
in
the
midst
of
all
this
motion
perhaps
there
may
be
some
the
temporary
stars
which
appear
to
rise
again
from
their
ashes
would
seem
to
indicate
it
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
would
be
difficult
for
meetings
to
occur
because
space
is
immense
relatively
to
the
celestial
bodies
and
because
the
motion
by
which
each
body
is
animated
entirely
prevents
it
from
submitting
passively
to
the
attraction
of
another
body
and
falling
upon
it
it
keeps
its
own
motion
which
can
not
be
destroyed
and
glides
around
the
focus
which
attracts
it
as
a
butterfly
would
obey
the
attraction
of
a
flame
without
burning
itself
in
it
besides
absolutely
speaking
these
motions
are
not
rapid
indeed
everything
runs
flies
falls
rolls
rushes
through
the
void
but
at
such
respective
distances
that
it
all
appears
to
be
at
rest
if
we
wanted
to
place
in
a
frame
the
size
of
paris
the
stars
whose
distances
have
been
measured
up
to
the
present
time
the
nearest
star
would
be
placed
at
two
kilometres
from
the
sun
from
which
the
earth
would
be
distant
one
centimetre
jupiter
at
five
centimetres
and
neptune
at
thirty
centimetres
the
of
cygnus
would
be
at
four
kilometres
sirius
at
ten
kilometres
the
polar
star
at
kilometres
etc
and
the
immense
majority
of
the
stars
would
remain
outside
the
department
of
the
seine
well
to
give
to
all
these
projectiles
their
relative
motions
the
earth
would
take
a
year
to
run
through
its
orbit
of
a
centimetre
radius
jupiter
twelve
years
to
run
through
his
of
five
centimetres
and
neptune
one
hundred
and
years
the
proper
motions
of
the
sun
and
stars
would
be
of
the
same
nature
that
is
to
say
all
would
appear
to
be
at
rest
even
under
the
microscope
urania
reigns
with
calmness
and
serenity
in
the
immensity
of
the
universe
so
the
constitution
of
the
sidereal
universe
is
just
like
that
of
the
bodies
which
we
call
material
all
bodies
organic
or
inorganic
man
animal
plant
stone
iron
bronze
are
composed
of
molecules
which
are
in
perpetual
motion
and
which
do
not
touch
one
another
each
one
of
these
atoms
is
infinitely
small
and
invisible
not
only
to
the
eye
not
only
to
the
microscope
but
even
to
thought
since
it
is
possible
that
these
atoms
may
be
centres
of
force
it
has
been
calculated
that
in
the
head
of
a
pin
there
are
not
less
than
eight
sextillions
of
atoms
that
is
eight
thousand
milliards
of
milliards
and
that
in
one
centimetre
of
cubic
air
there
are
not
less
than
a
sextillion
of
molecules
all
these
atoms
all
these
molecules
are
in
motion
under
the
influence
of
the
forces
which
govern
them
and
as
compared
with
their
dimensions
great
distances
separate
them
we
may
even
believe
that
there
is
in
principle
but
one
kind
of
atoms
and
that
it
is
the
number
of
primitive
atoms
essentially
simple
and
homogeneous
their
modes
of
arrangement
and
their
motions
which
constitute
the
diversity
of
molecules
a
molecule
of
gold
of
iron
would
not
differ
from
a
molecule
of
sulphur
of
oxygen
of
hydrogen
except
in
the
number
the
disposition
and
the
motion
of
the
primitive
atoms
which
compose
it
each
molecule
would
be
a
system
a
microcosm
but
whatever
may
be
the
idea
that
one
conceives
of
the
inner
constitution
of
bodies
the
truth
is
now
recognized
and
indisputable
that
the
fixed
point
for
which
our
imagination
has
been
seeking
exists
nowhere
archimedes
can
vainly
call
for
a
point
of
support
that
he
may
lift
the
world
like
atoms
rest
on
the
on
immaterial
force
everything
moves
urged
on
by
attraction
and
as
if
in
search
of
that
fixed
point
which
flies
as
it
is
pursued
and
which
does
not
exist
since
in
the
infinite
the
centre
is
everywhere
and
nowhere
positive
minds
which
assert
with
so
much
assurance
that
matter
reigns
alone
with
its
properties
and
who
smile
disdainfully
at
the
researches
of
thinkers
should
first
tell
us
what
they
mean
by
that
famous
word
matter
if
they
did
not
stop
at
the
surface
of
things
if
they
even
suspected
that
appearances
hid
intangible
realities
they
would
doubtless
be
a
little
more
modest
to
us
who
seek
the
truth
with
no
jealousy
of
system
it
seems
that
the
essence
of
matter
remains
as
mysterious
as
the
essence
of
force
the
visible
universe
not
being
in
the
least
what
it
appears
to
be
to
our
senses
in
fact
that
visible
universe
is
composed
of
invisible
atoms
it
rests
upon
the
void
and
the
forces
which
govern
it
are
in
themselves
immaterial
and
invisible
it
would
be
less
bold
to
think
that
matter
does
not
exist
that
all
is
dynamism
than
to
pretend
to
affirm
the
existence
of
an
exclusively
material
universe
as
to
the
material
support
of
the
world
it
disappeared
a
somewhat
interesting
observation
precisely
with
the
conquest
of
mechanics
which
proclaim
the
triumph
of
the
invisible
the
fixed
point
vanishes
in
the
universal
balance
of
powers
in
the
ideal
harmony
of
ether
vibrations
the
more
one
seeks
it
the
less
one
finds
it
and
the
last
effort
of
our
thought
has
for
a
last
support
for
supreme
reality
the
infinite
illustration
illustration
a
soul
clothed
with
air
she
was
standing
in
her
chaste
nudity
with
uplifted
arms
twisting
the
thick
and
waving
masses
of
her
hair
which
she
was
trying
to
bring
into
subjection
on
the
top
of
her
head
a
fresh
young
beauty
who
had
not
yet
attained
the
fulness
and
perfection
of
developed
form
but
was
approaching
it
radiant
in
the
loveliness
of
her
seventeenth
year
a
child
of
venice
her
white
soft
skin
revealed
the
circulation
of
a
strong
and
ardent
beneath
its
transparency
her
eyes
shone
with
a
mysterious
and
haunting
light
and
the
dewy
redness
of
her
lightly
parted
lips
made
one
think
of
the
fruit
as
much
as
of
the
flower
she
was
marvellously
beautiful
as
she
stood
thus
and
if
some
hero
paris
had
received
a
mission
to
award
the
palm
to
her
i
do
not
know
which
he
would
have
laid
at
her
feet
that
of
grace
elegance
or
beauty
for
she
seemed
to
blend
the
living
charm
of
modern
attractiveness
with
the
calm
perfections
of
classic
beauty
the
happiest
the
most
unexpected
chance
had
led
the
painter
falero
and
me
to
where
she
was
one
lovely
afternoon
last
spring
we
were
walking
on
the
seashore
we
had
been
through
one
of
the
groves
of
with
their
leaves
which
are
so
frequent
between
nice
and
monaco
and
without
being
aware
of
it
had
entered
some
private
grounds
which
were
unenclosed
on
the
side
towards
the
beach
a
picturesque
winding
path
led
up
the
hill
we
had
just
passed
an
whose
golden
apples
recalled
the
garden
of
the
hesperides
the
air
was
fragrant
the
sky
a
deep
blue
and
we
were
discoursing
upon
a
parallel
between
art
and
science
when
my
companion
suddenly
stopped
as
if
by
an
irresistible
fascination
making
me
a
sign
to
be
silent
and
to
look
behind
the
clumps
of
cactus
and
a
few
feet
in
front
of
us
was
a
sumptuous
bathroom
with
its
western
window
open
letting
us
see
the
young
girl
standing
not
far
from
a
marble
basin
into
which
a
jet
of
water
fell
with
a
gentle
murmur
and
before
a
large
mirror
which
reflected
her
image
from
head
to
foot
probably
the
noise
of
the
falling
water
had
prevented
her
hearing
our
footsteps
we
stood
mute
and
motionless
behind
the
cactus
discreetly
or
indiscreetly
watching
her
she
was
lovely
and
apparently
unaware
of
her
own
beauty
her
feet
were
on
a
she
was
in
no
haste
finding
that
her
hair
was
still
too
damp
she
let
it
fall
about
her
again
turned
in
our
direction
and
picked
up
a
rose
from
the
table
near
the
window
then
going
back
to
the
long
mirror
she
resumed
her
finished
it
leisurely
put
the
little
rose
between
two
coils
and
turning
with
her
back
to
the
sun
stooped
probably
to
pick
up
her
first
piece
of
clothing
but
she
suddenly
sprang
back
with
a
piercing
cry
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
and
hastily
retreated
to
a
shaded
corner
we
have
always
thought
since
that
some
movement
of
our
heads
must
have
betrayed
our
presence
or
that
by
some
trick
of
the
mirror
she
had
seen
us
whatever
it
was
we
thought
it
prudent
to
retrace
our
steps
and
went
down
to
the
sea
again
by
the
same
path
ah
said
my
companion
i
assure
you
that
among
all
my
models
i
have
never
seen
any
more
perfect
even
for
my
picture
of
the
and
of
what
do
you
think
about
it
yourself
did
not
that
apparition
come
just
in
time
to
prove
that
i
am
right
you
need
waste
no
eloquence
upon
the
delights
of
science
acknowledge
that
art
also
has
its
charms
do
not
the
stars
of
earth
compare
favorably
with
the
beauties
of
the
sky
do
you
not
admire
the
graceful
beauty
of
that
form
as
i
do
what
exquisite
tints
what
flesh
i
should
not
have
the
bad
taste
not
to
admire
what
is
truly
beautiful
i
answered
i
admit
that
human
beauty
and
of
course
female
loveliness
in
particular
truly
represents
the
most
perfect
thing
that
nature
has
produced
on
our
planet
but
do
you
know
what
i
most
admire
in
that
being
it
is
not
its
artistic
or
Ã¦sthetic
aspect
it
is
the
scientific
proof
it
gives
of
a
simply
wonderful
fact
in
that
beautiful
body
i
see
a
soul
clothed
with
air
oh
you
are
fond
of
paradoxes
a
soul
clothed
with
air
that
is
rather
idealistic
for
so
real
a
body
no
doubt
the
charming
creature
has
a
soul
but
permit
an
artist
to
admire
her
body
her
vitality
her
solidity
her
color
i
do
not
object
but
it
is
just
that
physical
beauty
which
makes
me
admire
the
soul
in
her
the
invisible
force
that
formed
her
what
do
you
mean
by
that
we
surely
have
a
body
the
existence
of
a
soul
is
less
palpable
to
the
senses
yes
to
the
mind
no
now
your
senses
absolutely
deceive
you
about
the
motion
of
the
earth
the
nature
of
the
sky
the
apparent
solidity
of
the
body
about
beings
and
about
things
will
you
follow
my
reasoning
for
a
moment
illustration
when
i
breathe
the
perfume
of
a
rose
when
i
admire
the
beauty
of
form
the
smoothness
of
coloring
the
grace
of
this
flower
in
its
freshly
opening
bloom
what
strikes
me
most
is
the
work
of
the
hidden
unknown
mysterious
force
which
rules
over
the
plant
life
and
can
direct
it
in
the
maintenance
of
its
existence
which
chooses
the
proper
molecules
of
air
water
and
earth
for
its
nourishment
and
which
knows
above
all
how
to
assimilate
those
molecules
and
group
them
so
delicately
as
to
form
this
graceful
stem
these
dainty
little
green
leaves
these
soft
pink
petals
these
exquisite
tints
and
delicious
fragrance
this
mysterious
force
is
the
animating
principle
of
the
plant
put
a
an
acorn
a
grain
of
wheat
and
a
side
by
side
in
the
ground
each
germ
will
build
up
its
own
organism
illustration
i
knew
a
which
was
dying
on
the
ruins
of
an
old
wall
a
few
feet
from
good
rich
soil
in
a
ditch
and
which
in
despair
threw
out
a
venturesome
root
reached
the
coveted
soil
buried
itself
there
and
gained
a
solid
footing
so
that
by
degrees
although
a
motionless
thing
it
changed
its
place
let
its
original
roots
die
left
the
stones
and
lived
resuscitated
upon
the
organ
that
had
set
it
free
i
have
known
elms
which
were
going
to
eat
up
the
soil
of
a
fertile
field
whose
food
had
been
cut
off
from
them
by
a
wide
ditch
and
who
therefore
determined
to
make
their
uncut
roots
pass
under
the
ditch
they
succeeded
and
returned
to
their
regular
food
much
to
the
cultivator
astonishment
i
knew
an
heroic
jasmine
which
went
eight
times
through
holes
in
a
board
which
kept
the
light
away
from
it
and
which
a
teasing
observer
would
put
back
into
the
shade
hoping
at
last
to
wear
out
the
flower
energy
but
he
did
not
succeed
a
plant
breathes
drinks
eats
selects
refuses
seeks
works
lives
acts
according
to
its
instincts
one
does
a
charm
another
pines
a
third
is
nervous
and
agitated
the
shivers
and
droops
its
leaves
at
the
slightest
touch
in
certain
hours
of
the
calla
lily
is
warm
the
pink
is
phosphorescent
the
valisneria
goes
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
lake
to
ripen
the
fruit
of
her
loves
in
these
manifestations
of
an
unknown
life
the
philosopher
can
not
help
recognizing
a
song
from
the
universal
choir
in
the
plant
world
i
go
no
further
for
the
human
soul
just
now
although
it
is
incomparably
superior
to
the
soul
of
a
plant
and
although
it
has
created
an
intellectual
world
as
much
above
the
rest
of
the
terrestrial
world
as
the
stars
are
higher
than
the
earth
i
am
not
looking
at
it
now
from
the
point
of
view
of
its
spiritual
faculties
but
only
as
force
animating
the
human
being
ah
i
wonder
that
that
force
can
group
the
atoms
that
we
breathe
or
that
we
assimilate
by
nutrition
and
form
this
charming
being
think
of
that
young
girl
the
day
she
was
born
and
follow
in
thought
the
gradual
development
of
that
little
body
through
the
years
of
her
awkward
age
to
the
first
graces
of
youth
and
the
charms
of
womanhood
how
is
human
organism
nourished
developed
and
composed
you
know
by
respiration
and
nutrition
the
air
supplies
three
quarters
of
our
nourishment
by
respiration
the
oxygen
in
the
air
maintains
the
fire
of
life
and
the
body
is
comparable
to
a
flame
constantly
renewed
by
the
principles
of
combustion
the
lack
of
oxygen
extinguishes
life
as
it
extinguishes
a
lamp
by
respiration
the
black
venous
blood
is
transformed
into
red
arterial
blood
and
regenerated
the
lungs
are
a
fine
tissue
pierced
with
from
forty
to
fifty
millions
of
little
holes
which
are
just
too
small
for
the
blood
to
filter
through
and
just
large
enough
for
the
air
to
penetrate
them
a
perpetual
interchange
of
gas
takes
place
between
the
air
and
the
blood
the
first
furnishing
the
second
with
oxygen
the
second
eliminating
carbonic
acid
on
the
one
hand
the
atmospheric
oxygen
burns
carbon
in
the
lung
on
the
other
the
lung
exhales
carbonic
acid
nitrogen
and
water
in
the
form
of
vapor
in
the
daytime
plants
breathe
by
an
opposite
process
they
absorb
carbonic
acid
and
exhale
oxygen
by
this
difference
maintaining
one
part
of
the
general
equilibrium
of
terrestrial
life
of
what
is
the
human
body
composed
an
average
adult
man
weighs
kilograms
of
this
amount
there
are
nearly
kilograms
of
water
in
the
blood
and
flesh
analyze
the
substance
of
our
body
you
will
find
albumen
fibrine
caseine
and
gelatine
that
is
organic
substances
composed
originally
of
the
four
essential
gases
oxygen
nitrogen
hydrogen
and
carbonic
acid
you
will
also
find
substances
with
no
nitrogen
such
as
gum
sugar
starch
and
fat
these
matters
likewise
pass
through
our
organism
their
carbon
and
hydrogen
are
consumed
by
the
oxygen
breathed
in
during
respiration
and
then
exhaled
under
the
form
of
carbonic
acid
and
water
you
are
not
unaware
that
water
is
a
combination
of
two
gases
oxygen
and
hydrogen
the
air
is
a
mixture
of
two
gases
oxygen
and
nitrogen
to
which
are
added
in
lesser
proportions
water
in
the
form
of
vapor
which
however
is
but
condensed
oxygen
etc
thus
our
body
is
composed
only
of
transformed
gases
but
interrupted
my
companion
we
do
not
live
solely
upon
the
air
at
certain
hours
indicated
by
our
stomachs
it
is
very
necessary
to
add
some
supplies
which
are
not
without
a
value
of
their
own
such
as
a
pheasant
wing
a
filet
de
sole
a
glass
of
chÃ¢teau
laffitte
or
champagne
or
as
your
taste
may
prefer
asparagus
grapes
peaches
yes
that
all
passes
through
our
organism
and
renews
its
tissues
pretty
rapidly
too
for
in
a
few
months
not
in
seven
years
as
was
formerly
thought
our
body
is
entirely
renewed
to
return
to
that
lovely
being
who
posed
before
us
just
now
none
of
that
flesh
which
we
admired
existed
three
or
four
months
ago
those
shoulders
that
face
those
eyes
that
mouth
those
arms
that
hair
and
even
to
the
very
nails
all
that
organism
is
but
a
current
of
molecules
a
ceaselessly
renewed
flame
a
river
which
we
may
look
at
all
our
lives
but
never
see
the
same
water
again
now
all
that
is
but
assimilated
gas
condensed
and
modified
and
more
than
anything
else
it
is
air
these
bones
themselves
so
solid
now
were
formed
and
hardened
gradually
do
not
forget
that
our
whole
body
is
composed
of
invisible
molecules
which
do
not
touch
each
other
and
which
are
continually
renewed
finally
our
table
is
spread
with
vegetables
and
fruits
if
we
are
vegetarians
we
absorb
substances
almost
entirely
drawn
from
the
air
this
peach
is
air
and
water
this
pear
this
grape
this
almond
are
also
made
of
air
and
water
a
few
gaseous
elements
drawn
to
them
by
the
sap
by
solar
heat
by
the
rain
asparagus
or
salad
peas
or
beans
lettuce
or
chicory
all
these
live
in
the
air
and
on
the
air
what
the
earth
furnishes
what
the
sap
seeks
out
are
also
gases
and
the
very
same
nitrogen
oxygen
hydrogen
carbon
etc
if
it
is
a
question
of
beefsteak
chicken
or
some
other
the
difference
is
not
very
great
sheep
and
oxen
feed
upon
grass
if
we
relish
a
partridge
cooked
with
cauliflower
a
roasted
quail
a
truffled
turkey
or
a
stewed
hare
all
these
substances
apparently
so
different
are
only
transformed
vegetable
matter
which
itself
is
but
a
grouping
of
molecules
taken
from
the
gases
of
which
we
have
just
been
speaking
air
water
elements
molecules
and
atoms
almost
imponderable
of
themselves
and
moreover
absolutely
invisible
to
the
naked
eye
thus
whatever
may
be
our
kind
of
nourishment
our
body
kept
repaired
developed
by
the
absorption
of
molecules
acquired
by
respiration
and
alimentation
is
really
but
a
current
incessantly
renewed
by
means
of
this
assimilation
directed
governed
and
organized
by
the
immaterial
force
which
animates
us
to
this
force
we
may
assuredly
give
the
name
of
it
groups
the
atoms
which
suit
it
eliminates
those
which
are
useless
to
it
and
starting
with
an
imperceptible
speck
an
indiscernible
germ
ends
by
building
up
the
apollo
belvidere
or
the
venus
of
the
capitol
phidias
is
but
a
coarse
imitator
compared
to
this
hidden
and
mysterious
force
mythology
tells
us
that
pygmalion
became
the
lover
of
a
statue
of
his
own
creation
not
so
pygmalion
praxiteles
michael
angelo
benvenuto
and
canova
created
nothing
but
statues
the
force
that
can
construct
the
living
body
of
man
and
woman
is
more
sublime
but
this
force
is
immaterial
invisible
intangible
imponderable
like
the
attraction
which
lulls
the
worlds
in
the
universal
melody
and
the
body
however
material
it
may
seem
to
us
is
in
itself
only
a
harmonious
grouping
formed
by
the
attraction
of
this
interior
force
so
you
see
that
i
confine
myself
strictly
within
the
limits
of
positive
science
in
speaking
of
this
young
girl
by
the
title
of
a
soul
clothed
with
air
like
you
or
me
for
instance
neither
more
nor
less
from
the
origin
of
humanity
down
to
within
a
century
or
two
it
has
been
believed
that
sensation
was
perceived
at
the
very
point
where
it
was
felt
a
pain
felt
in
the
finger
was
considered
as
having
its
seat
in
the
finger
itself
children
and
many
people
believe
so
still
physiology
has
demonstrated
that
the
impression
is
transmitted
from
the
to
the
brain
by
means
of
the
nervous
system
if
the
nerve
is
cut
the
finger
may
be
burned
with
impunity
the
paralysis
is
complete
we
have
been
able
to
determine
the
time
taken
by
the
impression
in
transmitting
itself
from
any
part
of
the
body
to
the
brain
and
it
is
known
that
the
rapidity
of
this
transmission
is
about
metres
per
second
since
then
we
have
referred
sensation
to
the
brain
but
we
have
stopped
half
way
the
brain
is
matter
like
the
finger
and
by
no
means
fixed
and
stable
matter
it
is
essentially
changing
matter
rapidly
variable
and
forming
no
identity
a
single
lobe
a
single
cell
a
single
molecule
which
does
not
change
does
not
and
could
not
exist
in
the
whole
mass
of
encephalic
matter
a
stoppage
of
motion
of
circulation
or
of
transformation
would
be
a
the
brain
subsists
and
feels
only
on
condition
of
submitting
like
all
the
rest
of
the
body
to
the
incessant
transformations
of
organic
matter
which
constitute
the
vital
circuit
so
it
can
not
be
that
our
personality
our
identity
lies
in
a
certain
grouping
of
cerebral
matter
our
individual
me
our
which
acquires
and
preserves
a
personal
scientific
and
moral
value
increasing
with
study
our
which
feels
itself
responsible
for
its
acts
performed
a
month
a
year
ten
twenty
fifty
years
ago
during
which
time
however
the
molecular
grouping
has
been
frequently
physiologists
who
affirm
that
the
soul
does
not
exist
are
like
their
ancestors
who
affirmed
that
they
felt
pain
in
their
finger
or
their
foot
they
are
a
little
less
far
from
the
truth
but
they
stop
on
the
way
when
they
stop
at
the
brain
and
make
the
human
being
consist
of
cerebral
impressions
this
hypothesis
is
all
the
less
excusable
because
these
same
physiologists
know
perfectly
well
that
personal
sensation
is
always
accompanied
by
a
modification
of
substance
in
other
words
the
of
the
individual
only
continues
when
the
identity
of
its
matter
ceases
to
continue
our
principle
of
sensibility
then
can
not
be
a
material
object
it
is
put
in
communication
with
the
universe
by
cerebral
impressions
by
the
chemical
forces
disengaged
in
the
encephalon
in
consequence
of
material
combinations
but
it
is
and
our
organic
constitution
is
perpetually
transformed
under
the
direction
of
a
psychic
principle
some
molecule
now
incorporated
in
our
organism
escapes
from
it
by
expiration
perspiration
to
belong
to
the
atmosphere
for
a
longer
or
shorter
time
then
to
be
incorporated
into
another
organism
plant
animal
or
man
the
molecules
which
actually
constitute
your
body
were
not
all
made
part
of
your
person
yesterday
and
none
of
them
were
there
three
months
ago
where
were
they
either
in
the
air
or
in
another
body
all
the
molecules
now
forming
your
organic
tissues
your
lungs
your
eyes
your
brain
your
legs
have
already
served
to
form
other
organic
tissues
we
are
all
resuscitated
dead
men
made
from
the
dust
of
our
ancestors
if
all
the
people
who
have
lived
up
to
this
time
arose
from
the
dead
there
would
be
five
of
them
to
every
square
foot
upon
the
surface
of
all
the
continents
obliged
to
climb
on
one
shoulders
in
order
to
stand
but
they
could
not
all
be
completely
resuscitated
for
many
of
the
molecules
have
served
successively
for
several
bodies
our
own
organisms
likewise
resolved
into
their
ultimate
particles
will
help
to
form
the
bodies
of
our
descendants
each
molecule
of
air
then
goes
on
eternally
from
life
to
life
and
escapes
thence
from
death
to
death
by
turns
wind
wave
earth
animal
or
flower
it
is
incorporated
successively
into
the
substance
of
numberless
organisms
the
air
the
inexhaustible
source
whence
everything
that
lives
takes
its
breath
is
yet
an
immense
reservoir
into
which
everything
that
dies
pours
its
last
sigh
by
its
absorption
vegetable
and
animal
different
organisms
come
to
life
and
afterwards
perish
life
and
death
are
both
in
the
air
we
breathe
and
perpetually
succeed
each
other
by
the
exchange
of
gaseous
molecules
the
molecule
of
oxygen
which
this
old
oak
exhales
will
fly
away
to
the
lungs
of
a
child
in
its
cradle
the
last
sighs
of
a
man
will
weave
the
brilliant
corolla
of
a
flower
or
expand
like
a
smile
over
the
verdant
meadow
and
thus
by
an
infinite
series
of
partial
deaths
the
atmosphere
incessantly
nourishes
the
universal
life
spread
over
the
surface
of
the
world
and
if
nevertheless
some
objection
should
still
remain
unanswered
i
would
go
further
and
add
that
our
clothes
as
well
as
our
bodies
are
composed
of
substances
which
at
first
were
all
gaseous
take
this
thread
draw
it
out
what
a
resistance
how
many
webs
of
cambric
silk
linen
cotton
and
wool
industry
have
been
formed
by
the
help
of
these
warps
and
woofs
and
yet
what
is
a
thread
of
linen
flax
or
cotton
globules
of
air
in
juxtaposition
which
are
held
together
only
by
their
molecular
force
what
is
a
thread
of
silk
or
wool
another
set
of
molecules
in
juxtaposition
admit
then
that
our
clothes
as
well
are
air
gas
substances
drawn
in
the
beginning
from
the
atmosphere
oxygen
nitrogen
carbon
vapor
of
water
etc
i
am
glad
to
see
said
the
painter
that
art
is
not
so
far
from
science
as
is
supposed
in
certain
circles
if
your
theory
is
purely
scientific
to
you
to
me
it
is
art
and
of
the
best
besides
do
all
these
distinctions
exist
in
nature
in
nature
there
is
neither
art
nor
painting
nor
sculpture
music
nor
decoration
philosophy
nor
chemistry
nor
astronomy
nor
meteorology
look
at
the
sky
the
sea
those
of
the
alps
those
rosy
evening
clouds
those
luminous
perspectives
towards
the
italian
coast
all
that
is
one
there
is
unity
in
everything
and
since
molecular
philosophy
demonstrates
that
there
is
no
longer
any
body
that
even
the
atoms
in
a
bar
of
steel
or
platinum
do
not
touch
each
other
no
one
will
be
the
loser
provided
our
souls
are
left
us
yes
it
is
a
fact
against
which
no
prejudice
can
prevail
living
beings
are
souls
clothed
with
air
i
pity
the
worlds
deprived
of
their
atmosphere
we
had
returned
to
the
seashore
after
a
long
ramble
not
far
from
our
point
of
departure
and
were
passing
the
battlemented
wall
of
a
villa
on
our
way
from
beaulieu
to
cape
ferrat
when
two
very
fashionably
dressed
ladies
passed
us
they
were
the
duchess
of
v
and
her
daughter
whom
we
had
met
the
previous
thursday
at
a
ball
at
the
prÃ©fecture
we
bowed
to
them
and
disappeared
under
the
the
young
girl
inquisitive
daughter
of
eve
turned
to
look
after
us
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
a
sudden
blush
crimsoned
her
cheeks
it
was
doubtless
the
reflection
of
the
setting
sun
rays
illustration
perhaps
you
think
said
the
artist
also
looking
back
that
you
have
diminished
my
admiration
for
beauty
no
i
appreciate
it
still
more
in
it
i
bow
to
harmony
and
shall
i
confess
it
the
human
body
thus
considered
as
the
manifestation
to
the
senses
of
a
directing
soul
seems
to
me
to
acquire
thence
more
nobility
more
beauty
and
more
light

ad
veritatem
per
scientiam
i
was
studying
in
my
library
the
conditions
of
life
upon
the
surface
of
worlds
governed
and
illuminated
by
suns
of
different
sizes
when
glancing
at
the
i
was
struck
with
the
expression
i
had
almost
said
the
animation
of
my
dear
urania
face
it
was
the
gracious
living
expression
which
once
ah
how
quickly
the
earth
goes
round
and
how
short
a
quarter
of
a
century
is
which
once
and
it
seems
to
me
like
yesterday
which
once
in
those
youthful
days
so
quickly
flown
had
attracted
my
thoughts
and
inflamed
my
heart
i
could
not
keep
from
looking
at
her
again
and
resting
my
eyes
on
her
truly
she
was
still
just
as
beautiful
and
my
feelings
had
not
changed
she
drew
me
to
her
as
the
light
draws
an
insect
i
rose
from
my
table
to
approach
her
and
see
again
the
singular
effect
of
the
daylight
on
her
changing
face
and
i
surprised
myself
by
standing
before
her
forgetting
my
work
her
look
seemed
to
be
lost
in
the
distance
yet
she
was
looking
at
what
i
had
the
firm
conviction
that
she
was
really
looking
at
something
and
following
the
direction
of
that
fixed
motionless
solemn
although
not
severe
gaze
my
eyes
went
straight
to
portrait
hanging
there
between
two
really
urania
was
looking
fixedly
at
him
illustration
suddenly
the
picture
broke
away
from
the
wall
and
fell
breaking
the
frame
i
rushed
to
it
the
portrait
was
lying
on
the
carpet
and
gentle
face
was
turned
towards
me
picking
it
up
i
found
a
large
paper
grown
yellow
which
filled
up
the
whole
back
and
was
written
over
on
both
sides
in
spero
handwriting
why
had
i
never
noticed
this
paper
it
is
true
that
it
might
have
lain
under
the
setting
of
the
frame
hidden
beneath
the
protecting
cardboard
mat
when
i
brought
this
back
from
christiania
i
did
not
think
of
examining
its
arrangement
but
who
could
have
had
the
singular
idea
of
putting
this
sheet
in
such
a
place
i
recognized
my
friend
handwriting
and
glanced
over
the
two
pages
in
utter
bewilderment
according
to
all
appearances
they
must
have
been
written
on
the
last
day
of
the
young
life
the
day
of
his
ascension
to
the
aurora
borealis
probably
father
wished
to
preserve
these
last
thoughts
carefully
so
framed
them
with
spero
portrait
and
forgot
to
mention
it
when
he
afterwards
gave
me
the
portrait
as
a
memento
on
my
return
from
the
pilgrimage
to
my
two
friends
graves
however
that
might
be
placing
the
gently
on
the
table
i
experienced
the
deepest
emotion
as
i
recognized
every
detail
of
that
dear
face
they
were
his
very
eyes
so
sweet
so
deep
and
always
unfathomable
the
wide
brow
apparently
so
calm
the
delicate
mouth
with
its
reserved
sensitiveness
the
fresh
coloring
of
the
face
neck
and
hands
his
eyes
looked
at
me
whichever
way
i
turned
the
portrait
they
looked
at
urania
at
the
same
time
they
looked
everywhere
at
once
strange
idea
of
the
artist
i
could
not
resist
the
thought
of
urania
eyes
which
had
seemed
to
me
to
be
looking
at
the
portrait
with
embarrassing
intentness
her
celestial
countenance
no
longer
wore
the
same
expression
at
all
but
appeared
to
me
rather
to
be
melancholy
almost
sad
then
i
turned
again
to
the
mysterious
sheet
of
paper
it
was
written
in
a
clear
precise
hand
with
no
erasures
i
offer
it
to
the
readers
of
this
book
just
as
i
found
it
without
the
slightest
change
for
it
appears
to
be
the
very
natural
conclusion
of
the
preceding
episodes
here
it
is
this
is
the
scientific
testament
of
a
mind
which
on
the
earth
did
all
in
its
power
to
remain
independent
of
the
weight
of
matter
and
which
hopes
to
be
freed
from
it
i
should
like
to
leave
the
results
of
my
researches
in
the
form
of
aphorisms
it
seems
to
me
that
the
truth
can
be
reached
only
through
the
study
of
nature
that
is
to
say
by
science
here
are
the
inductions
which
appear
to
me
to
be
founded
on
this
method
of
observation
i
the
visible
tangible
ponderable
and
constantly
moving
universe
is
composed
of
invisible
intangible
imponderable
and
inert
atoms
ii
these
atoms
are
governed
by
force
to
constitute
bodies
and
to
organize
beings
iii
force
is
essential
entity
iv
visibility
tangibility
solidity
and
weight
are
relative
properties
and
not
absolute
realities
the
infinitely
small
the
experiments
made
in
beating
show
that
ten
thousand
leaves
are
contained
in
the
thickness
of
a
millimetre
a
millimetre
has
been
divided
on
a
glass
plate
into
a
thousand
equal
parts
and
infusoria
exist
which
are
so
small
that
their
entire
bodies
placed
between
two
of
these
divisions
do
not
touch
either
of
them
the
members
and
organs
of
these
beings
are
composed
of

of
molecules
and
these
of

in
the
duration
of
a
second

ether
through
which
light
is
transmitted
makes
oscillations

defined
vi
the
intangible
invisible
atom
scarcely
conceivable
to
our
mind
accustomed
to
superficial
judgments
constitutes
the
only
true
matter
and
what
we
call
matter
is
but
an
effect
produced
on
our
senses
by
the
motion
of
atoms
that
is
to
say
an
incessant
possibility
of
sensations
the
result
is
that
matter
like
the
manifestations
of
energy
is
only
a
mode
of
motion
if
motion
should
stop
if
force
should
be
annihilated
if
the
temperature
of
bodies
should
be
reduced
to
absolute
zero
matter
as
we
know
it
would
cease
to
exist
vii
the
visible
universe
is
composed
of
invisible
bodies
what
we
see
is
made
up
of
things
which
are
not
seen
there
is
but
one
kind
of
primitive
atom
the
constituent
molecules
of
different
bodies
iron
gold
oxygen
hydrogen
differ
only
in
the
number
grouping
and
motion
of
the
atoms
which
compose
them
viii
what
we
call
matter
vanishes
when
scientific
analysis
thinks
to
grasp
it
but
we
find
as
the
support
of
the
universe
and
the
origin
of
all
form
force
the
dynamic
element
by
my
will
i
can
unsettle
the
moon
in
her
course
the
movements
of
each
atom
on
our
earth
are
the
mathematical
resultant
of
the
undulations
of
the
luminiferous
ether
which
come
to
it
in

from
the
abysses
of

there

the
space

strange
coincidences
sometimes
occur
and
upon
the
day
that
george
spero
made
the
ascent
which
was
to
be
so
fatal
to
him
i
knew
that
he
had
started
from
the
extraordinary
restlessness
of
the
magnetic
needle
which
announced
at
paris
where
i
had
remained
the
intense
aurora
borealis
for
which
he
had
been
waiting
so
anxiously
to
make
his
aerial
journey
it
is
well
known
that
the
aurora
borealis
causes
magnetic
disturbances
which
are
felt
at
long
distances
from
their
manifestation
but
what
surprised
me
most
and
what
i
never
have
been
able
to
explain
is
that
at
the
very
time
of
the
accident
i
experienced
an
undefined
uneasiness
then
a
kind
of
presentiment
that
some
accident
had
happened
to
him

despatch
announcing
his
death
