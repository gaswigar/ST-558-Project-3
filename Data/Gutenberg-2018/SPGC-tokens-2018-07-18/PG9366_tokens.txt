the
curtain
of
the
big
bed
hung
down
beside
the
cot
when
old
jenny
shook
it
the
wooden
rings
rattled
on
the
pole
and
grey
men
with
pointed
heads
and
squat
bulging
bodies
came
out
of
the
folds
on
to
the
flat
green
ground
if
you
looked
at
them
they
turned
into
squab
faces
smeared
with
green
every
night
when
jenny
had
gone
away
with
the
doll
and
the
donkey
you
hunched
up
the
blanket
and
the
stiff
white
counterpane
to
hide
the
curtain
and
you
played
with
the
knob
in
the
green
painted
iron
railing
of
the
cot
it
stuck
out
close
to
your
face
winking
and
grinning
at
you
in
a
friendly
way
you
poked
it
till
it
left
off
and
turned
grey
and
went
back
into
the
railing
then
you
had
to
feel
for
it
with
your
finger
it
fitted
the
hollow
of
your
hand
cool
and
hard
with
a
blunt
nose
that
pushed
agreeably
into
the
palm
in
the
dark
you
could
go
along
the
slender
lashing
flourishes
of
the
ironwork
by
stretching
your
arm
out
tight
you
could
reach
the
curlykew
at
the
end
the
short
steep
flourish
took
you
to
the
top
of
the
railing
and
on
behind
your
head
backwards
that
way
you
got
into
the
grey
lane
where
the
prickly
stones
were
and
the
hedge
of
little
biting
trees
when
the
door
in
the
hedge
opened
you
saw
the
man
in
the
he
had
only
half
a
face
from
his
nose
and
his
downwards
his
beard
hung
straight
like
a
dark
cloth
you
opened
your
mouth
but
before
you
could
scream
you
were
back
in
the
cot
the
room
was
light
the
green
knob
winked
and
grinned
at
you
from
the
railing
and
behind
the
curtain
papa
and
mamma
were
lying
in
the
big
bed
one
night
she
came
back
out
of
the
lane
as
the
door
in
the
hedge
was
opening
the
man
stood
in
the
room
by
the
washstand
scratching
his
long
thigh
he
was
turned
slantwise
from
the
nightlight
on
the
washstand
so
that
it
showed
his
yellowish
skin
under
the
lifted
shirt
the
white
hung
by
itself
on
the
darkness
when
he
left
off
scratching
and
moved
towards
the
cot
she
screamed
mamma
took
her
into
the
big
bed
she
curled
up
there
under
the
shelter
of
the
raised
hip
and
shoulder
mamma
face
was
dry
and
warm
and
smelt
sweet
like
jenny
mamma
mouth
moved
over
her
wet
cheeks
nipping
her
tears
her
cry
changed
to
a
whimper
and
a
soft
ebbing
sob
mamma
breast
a
smooth
cool
round
thing
that
hung
to
your
hands
and
slipped
from
them
when
they
tried
to
hold
it
you
could
feel
the
little
ridges
of
the
stiff
nipple
as
your
finger
pushed
it
back
into
the
breast
her
sobs
shook
in
her
throat
and
ceased
suddenly
ii
the
big
white
globes
hung
in
a
ring
above
the
dinner
table
at
first
when
she
came
into
the
room
carried
high
in
jenny
arms
she
could
see
nothing
but
the
hanging
shining
globes
each
had
a
light
inside
it
that
made
it
shine
mamma
was
sitting
at
the
far
end
of
the
table
her
face
and
neck
shone
white
above
the
pile
of
oranges
on
the
dark
blue
dish
she
was
dipping
her
fingers
in
a
dark
blue
glass
bowl
when
mary
saw
her
she
strained
towards
her
leaning
dangerously
out
of
jenny
arms
old
jenny
said
and
made
her
arms
tight
and
hard
and
put
her
on
papa
knee
papa
sat
up
broad
and
tall
above
the
table
all
by
himself
he
was
dressed
in
black
one
long
brown
beard
hung
down
in
front
of
him
and
one
short
beard
covered
his
mouth
you
knew
he
was
smiling
because
his
cheeks
swelled
high
up
his
face
so
that
his
eyes
were
squeezed
into
narrow
shining
slits
when
they
came
out
again
you
saw
scarlet
specks
and
smears
in
their
corners
papa
big
white
hand
was
on
the
table
holding
a
glass
filled
with
some
red
stuff
that
was
both
dark
and
shining
and
had
a
queer
sharp
smell

papa
the
same
queer
sharp
smell
came
from
between
his
two
beards
when
he
spoke

sitting
up
beside

a
long
way
off

with
them
they
were
making
flowers
out
of
orange
peel
and
floating
them
in
the
finger
bowls
mamma
fingers
were
blue
and
in
the
water
behind
the
dark
blue
glass
of
her
bowl
the
floating
flowers
were
blue
she
could
see
mamma
smiling
as
she
stirred
them
about
with
the
tips
of
her
blue
fingers
her
underlip
pouted
and
shook

away
and
he
took
it
between
his
thumb
and
finger
and
turned
it
back
again
her
neck
moved
stiffly
her
head
felt
small
and
brittle
under
the
weight
and
pinch
of
the
big
hand
the
smell
and
the
sour
burning
taste
of
the
wine
made
her
cry

mamma

he
lifted
her
up
she
could
feel
her
body
swell
and
tighten
under
the
bands
and
drawstrings
of
her
clothes
as
she
struggled
and
choked
straining
against
the
immense
clamp
of
his
arms
when
his
wet
red
lips
pushed
out
between
his
beards
to
kiss
her
she
kicked
her
toes
drummed
against
something
stiff
and
thin
that
gave
way
and
sprang
out
again
with
a
cracking
and
popping
sound

as

she
rested
her
chin
on
the
nape
of
his
neck
where
his
brown
hair
thinned
off
into
shiny
golden
down
iii
old
jenny
sat
in
the
by
the
fireguard
in
the
nursery
she
wore
a
black
net
cap
with
purple
rosettes
above
her
ears
you
could
look
through
the
black
net
and
see
the
top
of
her
head
laid
out
in
stripes
of
grey
hair
and
pinky
skin
she
had
a
grey
face
flattened
and
like
her
eyes
she
held
it
tilted
slightly
backwards
out
of
your
way
and
seemed
to
be
always
staring
at
something
just
above
your
head
jenny
face
had
tiny
creases
and
crinkles
all
over
it
when
you
kissed
it
you
could
feel
the
loose
flesh
crumpling
and
sliding
softly
over
the
bone
there
was
always
about
her
a
faint
smell
of
sour
milk
no
use
trying
to
talk
to
jenny
she
was
too
tired
to
listen
you
climbed
on
to
her
lap
and
stroked
her
face
and
said
poor
jenny
dear
jenny
poor
so
tired
and
her
face
shut
up
and
went
to
sleep
her
broad
flat
nose
drooped
her
eyelids
drooped
her
long
grey
bands
of
hair
drooped
she
was
like
the
white
donkey
that
lived
in
the
back
lane
and
slept
standing
on
three
legs
with
his
ears
lying
down
mary
loved
old
jenny
next
to
mamma
and
mark
and
she
loved
the
white
donkey
she
wondered
why
jenny
was
always
cross
when
you
stroked
her
grey
face
and
called
her
it
was
not
as
if
she
minded
being
stroked
because
when
mark
or
dank
did
it
her
face
woke
up
suddenly
and
smoothed
out
its
creases
and
when
roddy
climbed
up
with
his
long
legs
into
her
lap
she
hugged
him
tight
and
rocked
him
singing
mamma
song
and
called
him
her
baby
he
was
was
the
baby
and
while
you
were
the
baby
you
could
sit
in
people
laps
but
old
jenny
did
want
her
to
be
the
baby
the
nursery
had
shiny
slippery
yellow
walls
and
a
brown
floor
and
a
black
hearthrug
with
a
centre
of
brown
and
yellow
flowers
the
greyish
chintz
curtains
were
spotted
with
small
brown
leaves
and
crimson
berries
there
were
cupboards
and
chests
of
drawers
and
chairs
that
were
brown
frames
for
the
yellow
network
of
the
cane
soft
bits
of
you
squeezed
through
the
holes
and
came
out
on
the
other
side
that
hurt
and
made
a
red
pattern
on
you
where
you
sat
down
the
tall
green
fireguard
was
a
cage
when
jenny
poked
the
fire
you
peeped
through
and
saw
it
fluttering
inside
if
you
sat
still
you
could
sometimes
hear
it
say
and
sometimes
the
fire
would
fly
out
suddenly
with
a
soft
hiss
high
above
your
head
you
could
just
see
the
gleaming
edge
of
the
brass
rail
jenny
where
yesterday
and
where
iv
when
you
had
run
a
thousand
hundred
times
round
the
table
you
came
to
the
blue
house
it
stood
behind
jenny
where
jenny
could
see
it
in
a
blue
garden
the
walls
and
ceilings
were
blue
the
doors
and
staircases
were
blue
everything
in
all
the
rooms
was
blue
mary
ran
round
and
round
she
loved
the
padding
of
her
feet
on
the
floor
and
the
sound
of
her
the
pussies
are
blue
the
beds
are
blue
the
matches
are
blue
and
the
mousetraps
and
all
the
litty
mouses
mamma
was
always
there
dressed
in
a
blue
gown
and
jenny
was
there
all
in
blue
with
a
blue
cap
and
mark
and
dank
and
roddy
were
there
all
in
blue
but
papa
was
not
allowed
in
the
blue
house
mamma
came
in
and
looked
at
her
as
she
ran
she
stood
in
the
doorway
with
her
finger
on
her
mouth
and
she
was
smiling
her
brown
hair
was
parted
in
two
sleek
bands
looped
and
puffed
out
softly
round
her
ears
and
plaited
in
one
plait
that
stood
up
on
its
edge
above
her
forehead
she
wore
a
wide
brown
silk
gown
with
falling
sleeves
pretty

said
mary
in
a
blue
dress
every
morning

and
dank
and
roddy
knocked
at
mamma
door
and
if
papa
was
there
he
called
out
go
away
you
little
beasts
if
he
was
not
there
she
said
come
in
darlings
and
they
climbed
up
the
big
bed
into
papa
place
and
said
good
morning
mamma
when
papa
was
away
the
lifted
curtain
spread
like
a
tent
over
cot
shutting
her
in
with
mamma
when
he
was
there
the
drawn
curtain
hung
straight
down
from
the
head
of
the
bed
ii
i
white
patterns
on
the
window
sharp
spikes
feathers
sprigs
with
furled
edges
stuck
flat
on
to
the
glass
white
webs
crinkled
like
the
skin
of
boiled
milk
stretched
across
the
corner
of
the
pane
crisp
sticky
stuff
that
bit
your
fingers
out
of
doors
black
twigs
thickened
with
a
white
fur
white
powder
sprinkled
over
the
garden
walk
the
white
ruffled
grass
stood
out
stiffly
and
gave
under
your
feet
with
a
pleasant
crunching
the
air
smelt
good
you
opened
your
mouth
and
drank
it
in
gulps
it
went
down
like
cold
tingling
water
frost
you
saw
the
sun
for
the
first
time
a
red
ball
that
hung
by
itself
on
the
yellowish
white
sky
mamma
said
yes
of
course
it
would
fall
if
god
was
there
to
hold
it
up
in
his
hands
supposing
god
dropped
the
sun
ii
the
yellowish
white
sky
had
come
close
up
to
the
house
a
dirty
blanket
let
down
outside
the
window
the
tree
made
a
black
pattern
on
it
clear
glass
beads
hung
in
a
row
from
the
black
branch
each
black
twig
was
tipped
with
a
glass
bead
when
jenny
opened
the
window
there
was
a
queer
cold
smell
like
the
smell
of
the
black
water
in
the
butt
thin
white
powder
fluttered
out
of
the
blanket
and
fell
a
thick
powder
a
white
fluff
that
piled
itself
in
a
ridge
on
the
and
curved
softly
in
the
corner
of
the
sash
it
was
cold
and
melted
on
your
tongue
with
a
taste
of
in
the
garden

down
in
a
peak
between

green
eyes
her
tabby
cape

on
along
the
back
of
her
tail
tapering
to
the
tip
sarah
crouched
against
the
fireguard
her
haunches
raised
her
head
sunk
back
on
her
shoulders
and
her
paws
tucked
in
under
her
white
pouting
breast

stooped
over
her

smile

stroked
her
sarah

under

trembled
when

held
her
in

the
warm
sweet
sleepy
smell
that
came
from
the
top
of
her
head

sat
on

table
swinging
his
legs
his
dark
mournful
eyes
watched
mark
under
their
doggy

looked
like

again
and
again
mamma
came
and
took
her
into
the
room
with
the
big
bed
the
gas
blazed
in
the
white
globes
lovely
white
lights
washed
like
water
over
the
polished
yellow
furniture
the
bed
the
great
high
wardrobe
the
chests
of
drawers
the
twisted
poles
of
the
there
were
soft
rounds
and
edges
of
blond
light
on
the
white
marble
and
the
white
marble
washstand
the
drawn
curtains
were
covered
with
shining
silver
patterns
on
a
sleek
green
ground
that
shone
all
these
things
showed
again
in
the
long
flashing
mirrors
mary
looked
round
the
room
and
wondered
why
the
squat
grey
men
had
gone
out
of
the
curtains
do
look
about
you
said
mamma
look
at
me

given
her
mark
does
say
want
mary
dollies
papa

but
want
sarah
and
that
selfish
and
mamma
sat
down
on
the
low
chair
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
god
she
said
hates
selfishness
and
god
is
grieved
every
time
mary
is
and
selfish
he
wants
her
to
give
up
her
will
when
mamma
talked
about
god
she
took
you
on
her
lap
and
you
played
with
the
gold
tassel
on
her
watch
chain
her
face
was
solemn
and
tender
she
spoke
softly
she
was
afraid
that
god
might
hear
her
talking
about
him
and
would
like
it
mary
knelt
in
mamma
lap
and
said
gentle
jesus
meek
and
mild
and
our
father
and
played
with
the
gold
tassel
every
day

and
gentle
jesus
meek
and
mild
what
hallowed
holy
said
mamma
what
god
is
sacred
and
holy
mary
twisted
the
gold
tassel
and
made
it
dance
and
run
through
the
loop
of
the
chain
mamma
took
it
out
of
her
hands
and
pressed
them
together
and
stooped
her
head
to
them
and
kissed
them
she
could
feel
the
kiss
tingling
through
her
body
from
her
and
she
was
suddenly
docile
and
appeased
when
she
lay
in
her
cot
behind
the
curtain
she
prayed
please
god
keep
me
from
wanting
sarah
in
the
morning
she
remembered
when
she
looked
at
sarah
she
thought
sarah
is
mark
cat
and
dank
cat
she
touched
her
with
the
tips
of
her
fingers
sarah
eyes
were
reproachful
and
unhappy
she
ran
away
and
crept
under
the
chest
of
drawers
mamma
gave
sarah
to
mark
mamma
was
sacred
and
holy
mark
was
sacred
and
holy
sarah
was
sacred
and
holy
crouching
under
the
chest
of
drawers
with
her
eyes
gleaming
in
the
darkness
vi
it
was
a
good
and
happy
day
she
lay
on
the
big
bed
her
head
rested
on
mamma
arm
mamma
face
was
close
to
her
water
trickled
into
her
eyes
out
of
the
wet
pad
of
under
the
cold
pad
a
hot
grinding
pain
came
from
the
hole
in
her
forehead
jenny
stood
beside
the
bed
her
face
had
waked
up
and
she
was
busy
squeezing
something
out
of
a
red
sponge
into
a
basin
of
pink
water
when
mamma
pressed
the
tight
the
pain
ground
harder
when
she
loosened
it
blood
ran
out
of
the
hole
and
the
was
warm
again
then
jenny
put
on
the
sponge
she
could
hear
jenny
say
it
was
the
master
fault
she
did
ought
to
have
been
left
in
the
room
with
him
she
remembered
the
and
the
sharp
spike
on
the
fender
and
papa
legs
stretched
out
he
had
told
her
not
to
run
so
fast
and
she
had
run
faster
and
faster
it
was
papa
fault
she
remembered
tripping
over
papa
legs
then
falling
on
the
spike
then
nothing
then
waking
in
mamma
room
she
was
crying
the
pain
made
her
feel
good
and
happy
and
mamma
was
calling
her
her
darling
and
her
little
lamb
mamma
loved
her
jenny
loved
her
mark
and
dank
and
roddy
came
in
mark

sarah
in
his
arms
they
stood
by
the
bed
and
looked
at
her
their
faces
pressed
close
roddy
had
been
crying
but
mark
and
dank
were
excited
they
climbed
on
to
the
bed
and
kissed
her
they
made
sarah
crouch
down
close
beside
her
and
held
her
there
they
spoke
very
fast
one
after
the
other
we
brought
you
sarah
we
given
you
sarah
she
your
cat
to
keep
for
ever
she
was
glad
that
she
had
tripped
over
papa
legs
it
was
a
good
and
happy
day
vii
the
sun
shone
the
polished
green
blades
of
the
grass
glittered
the
gravel
walk
and
the
nasturtium
bed
together
made
a
broad
orange
blaze
specks
like
glass
sparkled
in
the
hot
grey
earth
on
the
grey
flagstone
the
red
poppy
you
picked
yesterday
was
a
black
thread
a
purple
stain
she
was
happy
sitting
on
the
grass
drawing
the
fine
sharp
blades
between
her
fingers
sniffing
the
smell
of
the
mignonette
that
tingled
like
sweet
pepper
opening
and
shutting
the
yellow
mouths
of
the
the
garden
flowers
stood
still
straight
up
in
the
grey
earth
they
were
as
tall
as
you
were
you
could
look
at
them
a
long
time
without
being
tired
the
garden
flowers
were
not
like
the
animals
the
cat
sarah
bumped
her
sleek
head
under
your
chin
you
could
feel
her
purr
throbbing
under
her
ribs
and
crackling
in
her
throat
the
white
rabbit
pushed
out
his
nose
to
you
and
drew
it
in
again
quivering
and
breathed
his
sweet
breath
into
your
mouth
the
garden
flowers
would
let
you
love
them
they
stood
still
in
their
beauty
quiet
arrogant
reproachful
they
put
you
in
the
wrong
when
you
stroked
them
they
shook
and
swayed
from
you
when
you
held
them
tight
their
heads
dropped
their
backs
broke
they
shrivelled
up
in
your
hands
all
the
flowers
in
the
garden
were
mamma
they
were
sacred
and
holy
you
loved
best
the
flowers
that
you
stooped
down
to
look
at
and
the
flowers
that
were
not
mamma
the
small
crumpled
poppy
by
the
edge
of
the
field
and
the
ears
of
the
wild
rye
that
ran
up
your
sleeve
and
tickled
you
and
the
speedwell
striped
like
the
blue
eyes
of
meta
the
wax
doll
when
you
smelt
mignonette
you
thought
of
mamma
it
was
her
birthday
mark
had
given
her
a
little
sumach
tree
in
a
red
pot
they
took
it
out
of
the
pot
and
dug
a
hole
by
the
front
door
steps
outside
the
pantry
window
and
planted
it
there
papa
came
out
on
to
the
steps
and
watched
them
i
suppose
he
said
you
think
it
mamma
never
turned
to
look
at
him
she
smiled
because
it
was
her
birthday
she
said
of
course
it
grow
she
spread
out
its
roots
and
pressed
it
down
and
padded
up
the
earth
about
it
with
her
hands
it
held
out
its
tiny
branches
stiffly
like
a
toy
tree
standing
no
higher
than
the
mignonette
papa
looked
at
mamma
and
mark
busy
and
happy
with
their
heads
together
taking
no
notice
of
him
he
laughed
out
of
his
big
beard
and
went
back
into
the
house
suddenly
and
slammed
the
door
you
knew
that
he
disliked
the
sumach
tree
and
that
he
was
angry
with
mark
for
giving
it
to
mamma
when
you
smelt
mignonette
you
thought
of
mamma
and
mark
and
the
sumach
tree
and
papa
standing
on
the
steps
and
the
queer
laugh
that
came
out
of
his
beard
when
it
rained
you
were
naughty
and
unhappy
because
you
could
go
out
of
doors
then
mamma
stood
at
the
window
and
looked
into
the
front
garden
she
smiled
at
the
rain
she
said
it
will
be
good
for
my
sumach
tree
every
day
you
went
out
on
to
the
steps
to
see
if
the
sumach
tree
had
grown
viii
the
white
lamb
stood
on
the
table
beside
her
cot
mamma
put
it
there
every
night
so
that
she
could
see
it
first
thing
in
the
morning
when
she
woke
she
had
had
a
birthday
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
the
night
she
was
five
years
old
she
had
kept
on
waking
up
with
the
excitement
of
it
then
in
the
dark
twilight
of
the
room
she
had
seen
a
bulky
thing
inside
the
cot
leaning
up
against
the
rail
it
stuck
out
queerly
and
its
weight
dragged
the
counterpane
tight
over
her
feet
the
birthday
present
what
she
saw
was
not
its
real
shape
when
she
poked
it
stiff
paper
bent
in
and
crackled
and
she
could
feel
something
big
and
solid
underneath
she
lay
quiet
and
happy
trying
to
guess
what
it
could
be
and
fell
asleep
again
it
was
the
white
lamb
it
stood
on
a
green
stand
it
smelt
of
dried
hay
and
gum
and
paint
like
the
other
toy
animals
but
its
white
coat
had
a
dull
woolly
smell
and
that
was
the
real
smell
of
the
lamb
its
large
slanting
eyes
stared
off
over
its
ears
into
the
far
corners
of
the
room
so
that
it
never
looked
at
you
this
made
her
feel
sometimes
that
the
lamb
did
love
her
and
sometimes
that
it
was
frightened
and
wanted
to
be
comforted
she
trembled
when
first
she
stroked
it
and
held
it
to
her
face
and
sniffed
its
lamby
smell
papa
looked
down
at
her
he
was
smiling
and
when
she
looked
up
at
him
she
was
not
afraid
she
had
the
same
feeling
that
came
sometimes
when
she
sat
in
mamma
lap
and
mamma
talked
about
god
and
jesus
papa
was
sacred
and
holy
he
had
given
her
the
lamb
it
was
the
end
of
her
birthday
mamma
and
jenny
were
putting
her
to
bed
she
felt
weak
and
tired
and
sad
because
it
was
all
over
come
to
that
said
jenny
your
birthday
was
over
at
five
minutes
past
twelve
this
morning
when

it
come
again
not
for
a
whole
year
said
mamma
i
wish
it
would

mamma
shook
her
head
at
her

want
to
be
spoiled
and
petted
every
day

jenny

gave
me
my
lamb

mamma

you
birthday
presents
but
i

and
truly
you
did

to
have
no
more
birthdays
said
jenny
if
they
make
you
cry
why
could
they
see
that
crying
meant
that
she
wanted
papa
to
be
sacred
and
holy
every
day
the
day
after
the
birthday
when
papa
went
about
the
same
as
ever
looking
big
and
frightening
when
he
baa
into
her
face
and
called
out
mary
had
a
little
lamb
and
mary
mary
quite
contrary
she
looked
after
him
sorrowfully
and
thought
papa
gave
me
my
lamb
ix
one
day
uncle
edward
and
aunt
bella
came
over
from
chadwell
grange
they
were
talking
to
mamma
a
long
time
in
the
and
when
she
came
in
they
stopped
and
whispered
roddy
told
her
the
secret
uncle
edward
was
going
to
give
her
a
live
lamb
mark
and
dank
said
it
could
be
true
uncle
edward
was
not
a
real
uncle
he
was
only
aunt
bella
husband
and
he
never
gave
you
anything
and
anyhow
the
lamb
was
born
yet
and
could
come
for
weeks
and
weeks
every
morning
she
asked
has
my
new
lamb
come
when
is
it
coming
do
you
think
it
will
come
she
could
keep
on
sitting
still
quite
a
long
time
by
merely
thinking
about
the
new
lamb
it
would
run
beside
her
when
she
played
in
the
garden
it
would
eat
grass
out
of
her
hand
she
would
tie
a
ribbon
round
its
neck
and
lead
it
up
and
down
the
lane
at
these
moments
she
forgot
the
toy
lamb
it
stood
on
the
chest
of
drawers
in
the
nursery
looking
off
into
the
corners
of
the
room
neglected
by
the
time
uncle
edward
and
aunt
bella
sent
for
her
to
come
and
see
the
lamb
she
knew
exactly
what
it
would
be
like
and
what
would
happen
she
saw
it
looking
like
the
lambs
in
the
bible
picture
book
fat
and
covered
with
thick
pure
white
wool
she
saw
uncle
edward
with
his
yellow
face
and
big
nose
and
black
whiskers
coming
to
her
across
the
lawn
at
chadwell
grange
carrying
the
lamb
over
his
shoulder
like
jesus
it
was
a
cold
morning
they
drove
a
long
time
in
uncle
carriage
over
the
hard
loud
roads
between
fields
white
with
frost
and
uncle
edward
was
not
on
his
lawn
aunt
bella
stood
in
the
big
hall
waiting
for
them
she
looked
much
larger
and
more
important
than
mamma
aunt
bella
have
you
got
my
new
lamb
she
tried
not
to
shriek
it
out
because
aunt
bella
was
nearly
always
poorly
and
mamma
told
her
that
if
you
shrieked
at
her
she
would
be
mamma
said
and
aunt
bella
whispered
something
and
she
heard
mamma
answer
better
not
if
she
it
said
aunt
bella
she
understand
mamma
shook
her
head
at
aunt
bella
edward
would
like
it
said
aunt
bella
he
wanted
to
give
it
her
himself
it
present
mamma
took
her
hand
and
they
followed
aunt
bella
through
the
hall
into
the
kitchen
the
servants
were
all
there
rose
and
annie
and
cook
and
fisher
the
housekeeper
and
giles
the
young
footman
they
all
stared
at
her
in
a
queer
kind
way
as
she
came
in
a
low
screen
was
drawn
close
round
one
corner
of
the
fireplace
uncle
edward
and
pidgeon
the
bailiff
were
doing
something
to
it
with
a
yellow
uncle
edward
came
to
her
looking
down
the
side
of
his
big
nose
he
led
her
to
the
screen
and
drew
it
away
something
lay
on
the
floor
wrapped
in
a
piece
of
dirty
blanket
when
uncle
edward
pushed
back
the
blanket
a
bad
smell
came
out
he
said
here
your
lamb
mary
you
just
in
time
she
saw
a
brownish
grey
animal
with
a
queer
head
and
long
black
legs
its
body
was
drawn
out
and
knotted
like
an
enormous
maggot
it
lay
twisted
to
one
side
and
its
eyes
were
shut
that
is
my
lamb
it
the
lamb
i
always
said
miss
mary
was
to
have
is
it
pidgeon
yes
squoire
it
the

asoide
for
little
missy
then
said
mary
why
does
it
look
like
that
it
very
ill
mamma
said
gently
poor
uncle
edward
thought
like
to
see
it
before
it
died
you
glad
you
seen
it
you
no
just
then
the
lamb
stirred
in
its
blanket
it
opened
its
eyes
and
looked
at
her
she
thought
it
my
lamb
it
looked
at
me
it
lamb
and
dying
my
dying
the
bad
smell
came
again
out
of
the
blanket
she
tried
not
to
think
of
it
she
wanted
to
sit
down
on
the
floor
beside
the
lamb
and
lift
it
out
of
its
blanket
and
nurse
it
but
mamma
would
let
her
when
she
got
home
mamma
took
down
the
toy
lamb
from
the
chest
of
drawers
and
brought
it
to
her
she
sat
quiet
a
long
time
holding
it
in
her
lap
and
stroking
it
the
stiff
eyes
of
the
toy
lamb
stared
away
over
its
ears
iii
jenny
was
cross
and
tugged
at
your
hair
when
she
dressed
you
to
go
to
chadwell
grange
mamma
says
if
i
not
good
aunt
bella
will
be
do
you
think
it
really
true
jenny
tugged
i
thank
you
for
some
of
your
aunt
bella
illness
she
said
i
mean
mary
said
like
papa
was
in
the
night
every
time
i
get
and
jump
about
i
think
she
open
her
mouth
and
begin
well
if
she
was
to
you
oughter
be
sorry
for
her
i
sorry
for
her
but
i
frightened
too
that
not
being
good
said
jenny
but
she
left
off
tugging
somehow
you
knew
she
was
pleased
to
think
you
were
not
really
good
at
aunt
bella
where
fisher
dressed
and
undressed
you
and
you
were
allowed
to
talk
to
pidgeon
roddy
and
dank
said
you
ought
to
hate
uncle
edward
and
pidgeon
and
fisher
and
not
to
like
aunt
bella
very
much
even
if
she
was
sister
mamma
did
really
like
uncle
edward
she
only
pretended
because
of
aunt
bella
uncle
edward
had
an
ugly
nose
and
a
yellow
face
widened
by
his
black
whiskers
his
mouth
stretched
from
one
whisker
to
the
other
and
his
black
hair
curled
in
large
tufts
above
his
ears
but
he
had
no
beard
you
could
see
the
whole
of
his
mouth
at
once
and
when
aunt
bella
came
into
the
room
his
little
blue
eyes
looked
up
off
the
side
of
his
nose
and
he
smiled
at
her
between
his
tufts
of
hair
it
was
dreadful
to
think
that
mark
and
dank
and
roddy
did
like
him
it
might
hurt
him
so
much
that
he
would
never
be
happy
again
about
pidgeon
she
was
not
quite
sure
pidgeon
was
very
ugly
he
had
long
stiff
legs
and
a
long
stiff
face
finished
off
with
a
fringe
of
red
whiskers
that
went
on
under
his
chin
still
it
was
not
nice
to
think
of
pidgeon
being
unhappy
either
but
fisher
was
large
and
rather
like
aunt
bella
only
softer
and
more
bulging
her
round
face
had
a
high
red
polish
on
it
always
and
when
she
saw
you
coming
her
eyes
twinkled
and
her
red
forehead
and
her
big
cheeks
and
her
mouth
smiled
all
together
a
fat
simmering
smile
when
you
got
to
the
black
and
white
marble
tiles
you
saw
her
waiting
for
you
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
she
wanted
to
ask
fisher
if
it
was
true
that
aunt
bella
would
be
ill
if
she
were
naughty
but
a
squeezing
and
dragging
came
under
her
waist
whenever
she
thought
about
it
and
that
made
her
shy
and
ashamed
it
went
when
they
left
her
to
play
by
herself
on
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
house
aunt
bella
house
was
enormous
two
long
rows
of
windows
stared
out
at
you
their
dark
green
storm
shutters
folded
back
on
the
yellow
brick
walls
a
third
row
of
little
windows
and
little
shutters
blinked
in
the
narrow
space
under
the
roof
all
summer
a
sweet
smell
came
from
that
side
of
the
house
where
roses
hung
on
the
yellow
walls
between
the
green
shutters
there
was
a
cedar
tree
on
the
lawn
and
a
and
a
stone
fountain
goldfish
swam
in
the
clear
greenish
water
the
flowers
in
the
round
beds
were
stiff
and
shining
as
if
they
had
been
cut
out
of
tin
and
freshly
painted
when
you
thought
of
aunt
bella
garden
you
saw
calceolarias
brown
velvet
purses
with
yellow
spots
she
could
always
get
away
from
aunt
bella
by
going
down
the
dark
walk
between
the
yew
hedge
and
the
window
of
fisher
room
and
through
the
into
the
plantation
the
cocks
and
hens
had
their
black
timber
house
there
in
the
clearing
and
ponto
the
newfoundland
lived
all
by
himself
in
his
kennel
under
the
little
ragged
fir
trees
when
ponto
saw
her
coming
he
danced
on
his
hind
legs
and
strained
at
his
chain
and
called
to
her
with
his
loud
barking
howl
he
played
with
her
crawling
on
his
stomach
crouching
raising
first
one
big
paw
and
then
the
other
she
put
out
her
foot
and
he
caught
it
and
held
it
between
his
big
paws
and
looked
at
it
with
his
head
on
one
side
smiling
she
squealed
with
delight
and
ponto
barked
again
the
stable
bell
would
ring
while
they
played
in
the
plantation
and
uncle
edward
or
pidgeon
or
fisher
would
come
out
and
find
her
and
take
her
back
into
the
house
ponto
lifted
up
his
head
and
howled
after
her
as
she
went
at
lunch
mary
sat
quivering
between
mamma
and
aunt
bella
the
squeezing
and
dragging
under
her
waist
had
begun
again
there
was
a
pattern
of
green
ivy
round
the
dinner
plates
and
a
pattern
of
goats
round
the
silver
napkin
rings
she
tried
to
fix
her
mind
on
the
ivy
and
the
goats
instead
of
looking
at
aunt
bella
to
see
whether
she
were
going
to
be
she
be
if
you
left
mud
in
the
hall
on
the
black
and
white
marble
tiles
or
if
you
took
ponto
off
the
chain
and
let
him
get
into
the
house
or
if
you
spilled
the
gravy
aunt
bella
face
was
much
pinker
and
richer
and
more
important
than
mamma
face
she
thought
she
would
have
minded
quite
so
much
if
aunt
bella
had
been
white
and
brown
and
pretty
like
mamma
there
she
had
spilled
the
gravy
little
knots
came
in
aunt
bella
pink
forehead
her
face
loosened
and
swelled
with
a
red
flush
her
mouth
pouted
and
drew
itself
in
again
pulled
out
of
shape
by
something
that
darted
up
the
side
of
her
nose
and
made
her
blink
she
thought
i
know
i
know
i
it
going
to
happen
it
did
aunt
bella
only
said
you
should
look
at
your
plate
and
spoon
dear
after
lunch
when
they
were
resting
you
could
feel
naughtiness
coming
on
then
pidgeon
carried
you
on
his
back
to
the
or
fisher
took
you
up
into
her
bedroom
to
see
her
dress
in
fisher
bedroom
a
smell
of
rotten
apples
oozed
through
the
rosebud
pattern
on
the
walls
there
were
no
doors
inside
only
places
in
the
that
opened
behind
one
of
these
places
there
was
a
cupboard
where
fisher
kept
her
clothes
sometimes
she
would
take
the
lid
off
the
big
box
covered
with
and
show
you
her
sunday
bonnet
you
sat
on
the
bed
and
she
gave
you
peppermint
balls
to
suck
while
she
peeled
off
her
black
merino
and
squeezed
herself
into
her
black
silk
you
watched
for
the
moment
when
the
brooch
with
the
black
tomb
and
the
weeping
willow
on
it
was
undone
and
fisher
chin
came
out
first
by
the
open
collar
and
fisher
began
to
swell
when
she
stood
up
in
her
petticoat
and
bodice
she
was
enormous
her
breasts
and
hips
and
her
great
arms
shook
as
she
walked
about
the
room
mary
was
sorry
when
she
said
to
uncle
edward
and
aunt
bella
and
fisher
for
always
as
soon
as
she
got
home
roddy
rushed
at
her
with
the
same
questions
did
you
let
uncle
edward
kiss
you
yes
did
you
talk
to

dank
said

taken
ponto
off
the
chain
yet
no
well
then
that
shows
you
what
pigs
they
are
and
when
she
saw
mark
looking
at
her
she
felt
small
and
silly
and
ashamed
ii
it
was
the
last
week
of
the
midsummer
holidays
mark
and
dank
had
gone
to

on
them
the
snails
turned
over

over
on
each
other
and

out
a
green
foam
that
covered
them
like
soapsuds
as
they
died
mark
face
was
red
and
he
was
smiling

of

iv
i
that

red
book
with
a
gold
holly
wreath
on
the
cover
the
wreath
was
made
out
of
three
words
children
printed
in
letters
that
pretended
to
be

sprigs
inside
the
holly
wreath
was
the
number
of

in
fat
gold
letters

after

had
another
birthday
she
was
six
years
old
she
could
write
in
capitals
and
count
up
to
a
hundred
if
she
were
left
to
do
it
by
herself
besides
gentle
jesus

could
say
and
the
house
that
jack
built
and
the
lord

my
shepherd
and
the
slave
in
the
dismal
swamp
and
she
could
read
all
her
own
story
books
picking
out
the
words
she
knew
and
making
up
the
rest
roddy
never

eight
years
old

morning
after
her
birthday

and
she
were
sent
into
the
to
mamma
a
strange
lady
was
there
she
had
chosen
the
chair
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
the
berlin
parrot
on
it
she
sat
very
upright
stiff
and
thin
between
the
twisted
rosewood
pillars
of
the
chair
she
was
dressed
in
a
black
gown
made
of
a
great
many
little
bands
of
rough
crape
and
a
few
smooth
stretches
of
merino
her
crape
veil
folded
back
over
her
hat
hung
behind
her
head
in
a
stiff
square
a
jet
necklace
lay
flat
and
heavy
on
her
small
chest
when
you
had
seen
all
these
black
things
she
showed
you
suddenly
her
white
wounded
face
mamma
called
her
miss
thompson
miss
thompson
face
was
so
light
and
thin
that
you
thought
it
would
break
if
you
squeezed
it
the
skin
was
drawn
tight
over
her
jaw
and
the
bridge
of
her
nose
and
the
sharp
naked
arches
of
her
she
looked
at
you
with
mournful
startled
eyes
that
were
too
large
for
their
lids
and
her
flat
chin
trembled
slightly
as
she
talked
this
is
rodney
she
said
as
if
she
were
repeating
a
lesson
after
mamma
rodney
leaned
up
against
mamma
and
looked
proud
and
handsome
she
had
her
arm
round
him
and
every
now
and
then
she
pressed
it
tighter
to
draw
him
to
herself
miss
thompson
said
after
mamma
and
this
is
mary
her
mournful
eyes
moved
and
sparkled
as
if
she
had
suddenly
thought
of
something
for
herself
i
am
sure
she
said
they
will
be
very
good
mamma
shook
her
head
as
much
as
to
say
miss
thompson
must
not
build
on
it
every
weekday
from
ten
to
twelve
miss
thompson
came
and
taught
them
reading
writing
and
arithmetic
every
wednesday
at
eleven
the
boys
tutor
sippett
looked
in
and
taught
rodney
a
table
mamma
told
them
they
must
never
be
naughty
with
miss
thompson
because
her
mother
was
dead
they
went
away
and
talked
about
her
among
the
gooseberry
bushes
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
i
do
know
how
we
going
to
manage
rodney
said
there
no
sense
in
saying
we
must
be
naughty
because
her
mother
dead
i
suppose
mary
said
it
would
make
her
think
she
deader
we
ca
help
that
we
got
to
be
naughty
some
time
we
must
begin
mary
said
if
we
begin
we
shall
have
to
finish
they
were
good
for
four
days
from
ten
to
twelve
and
at
a
quarter
past
twelve
on
the
fifth
day
mamma
found
mary
crying
in
the
oh
mary
have
you
been
naughty
no
but
i
shall
be
i
been
so
good
that
i
ca
keep
on
any
longer
mamma
took
her
in
her
lap
she
lowered
her
head
to
you
holding
it
straight
and
still
ready
to
pounce
if
you
said
the
wrong
thing
being
good
when
it
pleases
you
is
being
good
she
said
it
not
what
jesus
means
by
being
good
god
wants
us
to
be
good
all
the
time
like
jesus
but
jesus
and
me
is
different
he
was
able
to
be
naughty
and
not
able
to
be
good
not
the
time
you
not
able
to
be
good
of
your
own
will
and
in
your
own
strength
you
not
good
till
god
makes
you
good
did
god
make
me
naughty
no
god
could
make
anybody
naughty
not
if
he
tried
no
but
said
mamma
speaking
very
fast
he
make
you
good
if
you
ask
him
will
he
make
me
good
if
i
do
ask
him
no
said
mamma
ii
miss
thompson
she
was
always
sure
you
would
be
good
and
mamma
was
sure
you
be
or
that
if
you
were
it
would
be
for
some
bad
reason
like
being
sorry
for
miss
thompson
as
long
as
roddy
was
in
the
room
mary
was
sorry
for
miss
thompson
and
when
she
was
left
alone
with
her
she
was
frightened
the
squeezing
and
dragging
under
her
waist
began
when
miss
thompson
pushed
her
gentle
mournful
face
close
up
to
see
what
she
was
doing
she
was
afraid
of
miss
thompson
because
her
mother
was
dead
she
kept
on
thinking
about
miss
thompson
mother
miss
mother
would
be
like
jenny
in
bed
with
her
cap
off
and
she
would
be
like
the
dead
field
mouse
that
roddy
found
in
the
lane
she
would
lie
on
the
bed
with
her
back
bent
and
her
head
hanging
loose
like
the
dear
little
field
mouse
and
her
legs
would
be
turned
up
over
her
stomach
like
his
toes
and
fingers
clawing
together
when
you
touched
her
she
would
be
cold
and
stiff
like
the
field
mouse
they
had
wrapped
her
up
in
a
white
sheet
roddy
said
dead
people
were
always
wrapped
up
in
white
sheets
and
chapman
had
put
her
into
a
coffin
like
the
one
he
was
making
when
he
gave
dank
the
wood
for
the
rabbit
house
every
time
miss
thompson
came
near
her
she
saw
the
white
sheet
and
smelt
the
sharp
bitter
smell
of
the
coffin
if
she
was
naughty
miss
thompson
who
seemed
to
have
forgotten
would
remember
that
her
mother
was
dead
it
might
happen
any
minute
it
never
did
for
miss
thompson
said
you
were
good
if
you
knew
your
lessons
and
at
the
same
time
you
were
not
naughty
if
you
did
know
them
you
might
not
know
them
but
you
would
know
them
or
the
next
day
by
midsummer
mary
could
read
the
books
that
dank
read
if
it
had
not
been
for
sippett
and
a
table
she
would
have
known
as
much
as
roddy
almost
before
they
had
time
to
be
naughty
miss
thompson
had
gone
mamma
said
that
roddy
was
not
getting
on
fast
enough
v
i
the
book
that

called
triumph

bella
said
that

was
a
good

would
interest
her
but

not
interest
her
that
was
how
she
heard
aunt
bella
and

together
mamma

on

responsible
they
think

and

in
his
new
black
velvet
suit

was
dressed
out
in
its
green
summer
chintzes
that
shone
and
crackled
with
glaze
mamma
had
moved
the
big
chinese
bowl
from
the
cabinet
to
the
round
mahogany
table
and
filled
it
with
white
roses
you
could
see
them
again
in
the
polish
blurred
white
faces
swimming
on
the
dark
pool
you
held
out
your
face
to
be
washed
in
the
clear
cool
scent
of
the
white
roses
when
mark
opened
the
door
a
smell
of
roast
chicken
came
up
the
kitchen
stairs
it
was
like
sunday
except
that
you
were
excited
look
at
papa
roddy
whispered
papa
excited
papa
had
come
home
early
from
the
office
he
stood
by
the
fireplace
in
the
long
tight
that
made
him
look
enormous
he
had
twirled
back
his
moustache
to
show
his
rich
red
mouth
he
had
put
something
on
his
beard
that
smelt
sweet
you
noticed
for
the
first
time
how
the
frizzed
mass
sprang
from
a
peak
of
silky
golden
hair
under
his
pouting
lower
lip
he
was
letting
himself
gently
up
and
down
with
the
tips
of
his
toes
and
he
was
smiling
secretly
as
if
he
had
just
thought
of
something
that
he
could
tell
mamma
whenever
he
looked
at
mamma
she
put
her
hand
up
to
her
hair
and
patted
it
mamma
had
done
her
hair
a
new
way
the
brown
plait
stood
up
farther
back
on
the
edge
of
the
sloping
chignon
she
wore
her
new
lavender
and
white
striped
muslin
lavender
ribbon
streamed
from
the
pointed
opening
of
her
bodice
a
black
velvet
ribbon
was
tied
tight
round
her
neck
a
jet
cross
hung
from
it
and
a
diamond
star
twinkled
in
the
middle
of
the
cross
she
pushed
out
her
mouth
and
drew
it
in
again
like
roddy
rabbit
and
the
tip
of
her
nose
trembled
as
if
it
knew
all
the
time
what
papa
was
thinking
she
was
so
soft
and
pretty
that
you
could
hardly
bear
it
mark
stood
behind
her
chair
and
when
papa
was
not
looking
he
kissed
her
the
behaviour
of
her
mouth
and
nose
gave
you
a
delicious
feeling
that
with
aunt
lavvy
and
aunt
charlotte
you
would
have
to
be
so
very
good
the
front
door
bell
rang
papa
and
mamma
looked
at
each
other
as
much
as
to
say
it
going
to
begin
and
suddenly
mamma
looked
small
and
frightened
she
took
mark
hand
emilius
she
said
what
am
i
to
say
to
lavinia
you
do
say
anything
papa
said
mary
can
talk
to
lavinia
mary
jumped
up
and
down
with
excitement
she
knew
how
it
would
be
in
another
minute
aunt
charlotte
would
come
in
dressed
in
her
black
lace
shawl
and
crinoline
and
aunt
lavvy
would
bring
her
opinions
and
something
something
that
you
did
know
would
happen
iii
aunt
charlotte
came
in
first
with
a
tight
dancing
run
you
knew
her
by
the
long
black
curls
on
her
shoulders
she
was
smiling
as
she
smiled
in
the
album
she
bent
her
head
as
she
bent
it
in
the
album
and
her
eyes
looked
up
close
under
her
black
eyebrows
and
pointed
at
you
pretty
pretty
blue
eyes
and
something
frightening
that
made
you
look
at
them
and
something
queer
about
her
narrow
jaw
it
thrust
itself
forward
jerking
up
her
smile
no
black
lace
shawl
and
no
crinoline
aunt
charlotte
wore
a
blue
and
black
striped
satin
dress
bunched
up
behind
and
a
little
hat
perched
on
the
top
of
her
chignon
and
tied
underneath
it
with
blue
ribbons
she
had
got
in
and
was
kissing
everybody
while
aunt
lavvy
and
uncle
victor
were
fumbling
with
the
hat
stand
in
the
hall
aunt
lavvy
came
next
a
long
grey
face
black
bands
of
hair
parted
on
her
broad
forehead
black
eyebrows
blue
eyes
that
stuck
out
wide
that
did
point
at
you
a
grey
bonnet
a
grey
dress
a
little
white
shawl
with
a
narrow
fringe
drooping
she
walked
slowly
slowly
as
if
she
were
still
thinking
of
something
that
was
not
in
the
room
as
if
she
came
into
a
quiet
empty
room
you
thought
at
first
she
was
never
going
to
kiss
you
she
was
so
tall
and
her
face
and
eyes
held
themselves
so
still
uncle
victor
dark
and
white
smaller
than
papa
smaller
than
aunt
lavvy
thin
in
his
loose
his
forehead
and
black
eyebrows
were
twisted
above
his
blue
beautiful
eyes
he
had
a
small
dark
brown
moustache
and
a
small
dark
brown
beard
trimmed
close
and
shaped
prettily
to
a
point
he
looked
like
something
like
somebody
like
dank
when
he
was
mournful
like
dank
dog
tibby
when
he
hid
from
papa
he
said
well
caroline
well
emilius
aunt
charlotte
gave
out
sharp
cries
of
dear
and
darling
and
smothered
them
against
your
face
in
a
sort
of
moan
when
she
came
to
roddy
she
put
up
her
hands
roddy
yellow
hair
no
no
what
have
you
done
with
the
blue
eyes
and
black
hair

that
comes
of
letting
your
beard
grow
so
long
then
they
all
went
into
the

like

to
be
real

silver
christening

the
aunts
and

gave
you
when

were

squeezed
into
the
corner
between
mamma
and
mark

opposite
her
between
mark
and
daniel
she
to
look
at
aunt
charlotte
face
there
were
faint
grey
smears
on
it
as
if

scribbled
all
over
it
with
pencil
a
remarkable
conversation
aunt
lavvy

she
said
said
aunt
charlotte
iv
all
afternoon
till
papa
and
uncle
victor
walked
up
and
down
the
garden
path
talking
to
each
other
every
now
and
then
mark
and
mary
looked
at
them
from
the
nursery
window
that
night
she
dreamed
that
she
saw
aunt
charlotte
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
kitchen
stairs
taking
off
her
clothes
and
wrapping
them
in
white
paper
first
her
black
lace
shawl
then
her
chemise
she
stood
up
without
anything
on
her
body
was
polished
and
shining
like
an
enormous
white
china
doll
she
lowered
her
head
and
pointed
at
you
with
her
eyes
when
you
opened
the
stair
cupboard
door
to
catch
the
opossum
you
found
a
white
china
doll
lying
in
it
no
bigger
than
your
finger
that
was
aunt
charlotte
in
the
dream
there
was
no
break
between
the
end
and
the
beginning
but
when
she
remembered
it
afterwards
it
split
into
two
pieces
with
a
dark
gap
between
she
knew
she
had
only
dreamed
about
the
cupboard
but
aunt
charlotte
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
was
so
clear
and
solid
that
she
thought
she
had
really
seen
her
mamma
had
told
aunt
bella
all
about
it
when
they
talked
together
that
day
in
the
she
knew
because
she
could
still
see
them
sitting
bent
forward
with
their
heads
touching
aunt
bella
in
the
big
by
the
and
mamma
on
the
parrot
chair
end
of
book
one
book
two
childhood
vi
i
when
christmas
came
papa
gave
her
another
this
time
the
cover
was
blue
and
the
number
on
it
was
was
the
name
of
the
new
year
that
was
coming
after
christmas
it
meant
that
the
world
had
gone
on
for
one
thousand
eight
hundred
and
seventy
years
since
jesus
was
born
every
year
she
was
to
have
a
with
the
name
of
the
new
year
on
it
was
a
beautiful
number
it
sounded
nice
and
there
was
a
seven
in
it
seven
was
a
sacred
and
holy
number
so
was
three
because
of
the
three
persons
the
father
the
son
and
the
holy
ghost
and
because
of
the
seven
stars
and
the
seven
golden
candlesticks
when
you
said
to
mamma
you
kissed
her
either
three
times
or
seven
times
if
you
went
past
three
you
had
to
go
on
to
seven
because
something
dreadful
would
happen
if
you
did
sometimes
mamma
stopped
you
then
you
stooped
down
and
finished
up
on
the
hem
of
her
dress
quick
before
she
could
see
you
she
was
glad
that
the
had
a
blue
cover
because
blue
was
a
sacred
and
holy
colour
it
was
the
colour
of
the
ceiling
in
mary
chapel
at
ilford
and
it
was
the
colour
of
the
virgin
dress
there
were
golden
stars
all
over
the
ceiling
of
mary
chapel
roddy
and
she
were
sent
there
after
they
had
had
and
when
their
was
getting
better
they
were
not
allowed
to
go
to
the
church
at
barkingside
for
fear
of
giving
to
the
children
in
barnardo
homes
and
they
were
not
allowed
to
go
to
aldborough
hatch
church
because
of
propart
pupils
but
they
had
to
go
to
church
somewhere
or
no
in
order
to
get
to
heaven
so
mark
took
them
to
the
chapel
of
ease
at
ilford
where
the
virgin
mary
in
a
blue
dress
stood
on
a
sort
of
step
over
the
door
mamma
said
you
were
not
to
worship
her
though
you
might
look
at
her
she
was
a
graven
image
only
roman
catholics
worshipped
graven
images
they
were
heretics
that
meant
that
they
were
shut
outside
the
church
of
england
which
was
god
church
and
could
get
in
and
they
had
only
half
a
sunday
in
roman
catholic
countries
sunday
was
all
over
at
twelve
and
for
the
rest
of
the
day
the
roman
catholics
could
do
just
what
they
pleased
they
danced
and
went
to
theatres
and
played
games
as
if
sunday
was
one
of
their
own
days
and
not
god
day
she
wished
she
had
been
born
in
a
roman
catholic
country
every
night
she
took
the
to
bed
with
her
to
keep
her
safe
it
had
bible
puzzles
in
it
and
among
them
there
was
a
picture
of
the
name
of
god
a
shining
white
light
shaped
like
mamma
vinaigrette
with
black
marks
in
the
middle
mamma
said
the
light
was
the
light
that
shone
above
the
ark
of
the
covenant
and
the
black
marks
were
letters
and
the
word
was
the
real
name
of
god
she
said
he
was
sometimes
called
jehovah
but
that
was
not
his
real
name
his
real
name
was
a
secret
name
which
nobody
but
the
high
priest
was
allowed
to
say
when
you
lay
in
the
dark
and
shut
your
eyes
tight
and
waited
you
could
see
the
light
shaped
like
the
vinaigrette
in
front
of
you
it
quivered
and
shone
brighter
and
you
saw
in
the
middle
first
a
dark
blue
colour
and
then
the
black
marks
that
were
the
real
name
of
god
she
was
glad
she
could
read
it
for
she
would
have
been
certain
to
let
it
out
some
day
when
she
was
thinking
perhaps
mamma
knew
and
was
not
allowed
to
say
it
supposing
she
forgot
at
church
they
sang
praise
him
in
his
name
jah
and
rejoice
before
him
jah
was
god
short
for
jehovah
it
was
a
silly
name
jah
somehow
you
could
help
thinking
of
god
as
a
silly
person
he
was
always
flying
into
tempers
and
he
was
jealous
he
was
like
papa
dank
said
papa
was
jealous
of
mark
because
mamma
was
so
fond
of
him
there
was
a
picture
of
god
in
the
night
nursery
he
had
a
big
flowing
beard
and
a
very
straight
nose
like
papa
and
he
was
lying
on
a
sort
of
sofa
that
was
a
cloud
little
jesus
stood
underneath
him
between
the
virgin
mary
and
joseph
and
the
holy
ghost
was
descending
on
him
in
the
form
of
a
dove
his
real
name
was
jesus
christ
but
they
called
him
emmanuel
there
is
a
fountain
filled
with
blood
drawn
from
emmanuel
veins
and
sinners
plunged
beneath
that
flood
lose
all
their
guilty
stains
that
was
another
frightening
thing
it
would
be
like
the
fountain
in
aunt
bella
garden
with
blood
in
it
instead
of
water
the
goldfishes
would
die
mark
was
pleased
when
she
said
that
sarah
would
be
allowed
to
go
to
heaven
because
she
would
try
to
catch
the
holy
ghost
jesus
was
not
like
god
he
was
good
and
kind
when
he
grew
up
he
was
always
dressed
in
pink
and
blue
and
he
had
sad
dark
eyes
and
a
little
close
tidy
beard
like
uncle
victor
you
could
love
jesus
jenny
loved
him
she
was
a
wesleyan
and
her
niece
catty
was
a
wesleyan
catty
marched
round
and
round
the
kitchen
table
with
the
drying
the
plates
and
singing
love
jesus
yes
i
do
the
bible
tells
me
and
am
so
glad
that
my
father
in
heaven
tells
of
his
love
in
the
book
he
has
given
i
am
so
glad
that
jesus
loves
me
jesus
loves
me
jesus
loves
even
me
on
new
year
eve
jenny
and
catty
went
to
the
wesleyan
chapel
at
ilford
to
sing
the
new
year
in
catty
talked
about
the
old
year
as
if
it
was
horrid
and
the
new
year
as
if
it
was
nice
she
said
that
at
twelve
you
ought
to
open
the
window
wide
and
let
the
old
year
go
out
and
the
new
year
come
in
if
you
did
something
dreadful
would
happen
downstairs
there
was
a
party
uncle
victor
and
aunt
lavvy
and
aunt
charlotte
were
there
and
the
big
boys
from
vinings
and
the
vicarage
at
aldborough
hatch
mark
and
dank
and
roddy
were
sitting
up
and
roddy
had
promised
to
wake
her
when
the
new
year
was
coming
he
left
the
door
open
so
that
she
could
hear
the
clock
strike
twelve
she
got
up
and
opened
the
windows
ready
there
were
three
in
mamma
room
she
opened
them
all
the
air
outside
was
like
clear
black
water
and
very
cold
you
see
the
garden
wall
the
dark
fields
were
close
close
against
the
house
one
two
three
seven
when
the
last
stroke
sounded
the
new
year
would
have
come
in
ten
eleven
twelve
the
bells
rang
out
the
bells
of
ilford
the
bells
of
barkingside
and
far
beyond
the
flats
and
the
cemetery
there
would
be
bow
bells
and
beyond
that
the
bells
of
the
city
of
london
they
clanged
together
and
she
trembled
the
sounds
closed
over
her
they
left
off
and
began
again
not
very
loud
but
tight
tight
crushing
her
heart
crushing
tears
out
of
her
eyelids
when
the
bells
stopped
there
was
a
faint
whirring
sound
that
was
the
old
year
that
was
eighteen
going
out
by
itself
in
the
dark
going
away
over
the
fields
mamma
was
not
pleased
when
she
came
to
bed
and
found
the
door
and
windows
open
and
mary
awake
in
the
cot
ii
at
the
end
of
january
she
was
seven
years
old
something
was
bound
to
happen
when
you
were
seven
she
was
moved
out
of
mamma
room
to
sleep
by
herself
on
the
top
floor
in
the
night
nursery
and
the
day
nursery
was
turned
into
the
schoolroom
when
you
were
little
and
slept
in
the
cot
behind
the
curtain
mamma
would
sometimes
come
and
read
you
to
sleep
with
the
bits
you
wanted
the
lord
is
my
shepherd
and
or
ever
the
silver
cord
be
loosed
or
the
golden
bowl
be
broken
or
the
pitcher
be
broken
at
the
fountain
or
the
wheel
broken
at
the
cistern
and
the
city
had
no
need
of
the
sun
neither
of
the
moon
to
shine
in
it
for
the
glory
of
god
did
lighten
it
and
the
lamb
is
the
light
thereof
when
you
were
frightened
she
taught
you
to
say
he
that
dwelleth
in
the
secret
place
of
the
most
high
shall
abide
under
the
shadow
of
the
almighty
he
shall
cover
thee
with
his
feathers
and
under
his
wings
shalt
thou
trust
thou
shalt
not
be
afraid
for
the
terror
by
night
and
you
were
allowed
to
have
a
now
it
was
all
different
you
went
to
bed
half
an
hour
later
while
mamma
was
dressing
for
dinner
and
when
she
came
to
tuck
you
up
the
bell
rang
and
she
had
to
run
downstairs
quick
so
as
not
to
keep
papa
waiting
you
hung
on
to
her
neck
and
untucked
yourself
and
she
always
got
away
before
you
could
kiss
her
seven
times
and
there
was
no
you
had
to
read
the
bible
in
the
morning
and
it
always
had
to
be
the
bits
mamma
wanted
out
of
genesis
and
the
gospel
of
john
you
had
to
learn
about
the
one
god
and
the
three
persons
the
one
god
was
the
nice
clever
happy
god
who
made
mamma
and
mark
and
jenny
and
the
sun
and
sarah
and
the
kittens
he
was
the
god
you
really
believed
in
at
night
when
you
lay
on
your
back
in
the
dark
you
thought
about
being
born
and
about
arithmetic
and
god
the
sacred
number
three
went
into
eighteen
and
did
come
out
again
so
did
seven
she
liked
numbers
that
fitted
like
that
with
no
loose
ends
left
over
sippett
said
there
were
things
you
could
do
with
the
loose
ends
of
numbers
to
make
them
fit
that
was
fractions
supposing
there
was
somewhere
in
the
world
a
number
that
simply
would
fit
sippett
said
there
was
no
such
number
but
queer
things
happened
you
were
seven
years
old
yet
you
had
had
eight
birthdays
there
was
the
day
you
were
born
january
the
eighteen
at
five
in
the
morning
when
you
were
born
you
were
any
age
at
all
not
a
minute
old
not
a
second
not
half
a
second
but
there
was
eighteen
and
there
was
january
the
and
the
minute
just
before
you
were
born
you
really
tell
when
the
ended
and
the
began
because
when
you
counted
sixty
minutes
for
the
hour
and
sixty
seconds
for
the
minute
there
was
still
the
half
second
and
the
half
of
that
and
so
on
for
ever
and
ever
you
could
tell
when
you
were
really
born
and
nobody
could
tell
you
what
being
born
was
perhaps
nobody
knew
jenny
said
being
born
was
just
being
born
sarah
grandchildren
were
born
in
the
garden
under
the
wall
where
the
jasmine
grew
roddy
shouted
at
the
back
door
and
when
you
ran
to
look
he
stretched
out
his
arms
across
the
doorway
and
would
let
you
through
roddy
was
excited
and
frightened
and
mamma
said
he
had
been
very
good
because
he
stood
across
the
door
there
was
being
born
and
there
was
dying
if
you
died
this
minute
there
would
be
the
minute
after
then
if
you
were
good
your
soul
was
in
heaven
and
your
body
was
cold
and
stiff
like
miss
thompson
mother
and
there
was
lazarus
he
hath
been
in
the
grave
four
days
and
by
this
time
he
stinketh
that
was
dreadfully
frightening
but
they
had
to
say
it
to
show
that
lazarus
was
really
dead
that
was
how
you
could
tell
if
thou
hadst
been
here
our
brother
had
not
died
that
was
beautiful
when
you
thought
of
it
you
wanted
to
cry
supposing
mamma
died
supposing
mark
died
or
dank
or
roddy
or
even
uncle
victor
even
papa
they
could
jesus
would
let
them
when
you
were
frightened
in
the
big
dark
room
you
thought
about
god
and
jesus
and
the
holy
ghost
they
did
leave
you
alone
a
single
minute
god
and
jesus
stood
beside
the
bed
and
jesus
kept
god
in
a
good
temper
and
the
holy
ghost
flew
about
the
room
and
perched
on
the
top
of
the
linen
cupboard
and
bowed
and
bowed
and
said
and
there
was
the
parroquet
mark
had
given
her
the
stuffed
parroquet
on
her
birthday
and
mamma
had
given
her
the
bible
and
the
two
grey
china
vases
to
make
up
with
a
bird
painted
on
each
a
black
bird
with
a
red
beak
and
red
legs
she
had
set
them
up
on
the
under
the
picture
of
the
holy
family
she
put
the
bible
in
the
middle
and
the
parroquet
on
the
top
of
the
bible
and
the
vases
one
on
each
side
she
worshipped
them
because
of
mamma
and
mark
she
said
to
herself

iii
jenny
had
taken
her
for
a
walk
to
ilford
and
they
were
going
home
to
the
house
in
ley
street
there
were
only
two
walks
that
jenny
liked
to
go
down
ley
street
to
barkingside
where
the
little
shops
were
and
up
ley
street
to
ilford
and
spall
the
cobbler
she
liked
ilford
best
because
of
spall
she
carried
your
boots
to
spall
just
as
they
were
getting
comfortable
she
was
always
ferreting
in
sarah
cupboard
for
a
pair
to
take
to
him
spall
was
very
tall
and
lean
he
had
thick
black
eyebrows
rumpled
up
the
wrong
way
and
a
long
nose
with
a
red
knob
at
the
end
of
it
a
dirty
grey
beard
hung
under
his
chin
and
his
long
shaved
lips
curled
over
in
a
disagreeable
way
when
he
smiled
at
you
when
jenny
and
catty
went
to
sing
the
new
year
in
at
the
wesleyan
chapel
he
brought
them
home
jenny
liked
him
because
his
wife
was
dead
and
because
he
was
a
wesleyan
and
deputy
grand
master
of
the
independent
order
of
good
templars
you
had
to
shake
hands
with
him
to
say
he
always
said
the
same
thing
next
time
you
come
little
missy
show
you
the
deputy
regalia
but
he
never
did
jenny
had
made
her
stand
outside
in
the
shop
among
the
old
boots
and
the
sheets
of
leather
while
she
and
spall
went
into
the
back
parlour
to
talk
about
jesus
the
shop
smelt
of
leather
and
feet
and
onions
and
of
spall
so
that
she
was
glad
when
they
got
out
again
she
wondered
how
jenny
could
bear
to
sit
in
the
back
parlour
with
spall
coming
home
at
first
she
had
to
keep
close
by
jenny
side
jenny
was
tired
and
went
slowly
but
by
taking
high
prancing
and
dancing
steps
she
could
pretend
that
they
were
rushing
along
and
once
they
had
turned
the
crook
of
ley
street
she
ran
on
a
little
way
in
front
of
jenny
then
walking
very
fast
and
never
looking
back
she
pretended
that
she
had
gone
out
by
herself
when
she
had
passed
the
row
of
elms
and
the
farm
and
the
small
brown
brick
cottages
fenced
off
with
palings
she
came
to
the
low
ditches
and
the
flat
fields
on
either
side
and
saw
on
her
left
the
bare
brown
brick
pointed
end
of
the
tall
house
it
was
called
five
elms
further
down
the
road
the
green
and
gold
sign
of
the
green
man
and
the
scarlet
and
gold
sign
of
the
horns
tavern
hung
high
on
white
standards
set
up
in
the
road
further
down
still
where
ley
street
swerved
slightly
towards
barkingside
three
tall
poplars
stood
in
the
slant
of
the
swerve
a
queer
white
light
everywhere
like
water
thin
and
clear
wide
fields
flat
and
still
like
water
flooded
with
the
thin
clear
light
grey
earth
shot
delicately
with
green
blades
shimmering
ley
street
a
grey
road
whitening
suddenly
where
it
crossed
open
country
a
hard
causeway
thrown
over
the
flood
the
high
trees
the
small
scattered
cottages
the
two
taverns
the
one
tall
house
had
the
look
of
standing
up
in
water
she
saw
the
queer
white
light
for
the
first
time
and
drew
in
her
breath
with
a
sharp
check
she
knew
that
the
fields
were
beautiful
she
saw
five
elms
for
the
first
time
the
long
line
of
its
old
roof
its
flat
brown
face
the
three
rows
of
narrow
windows
four
at
the
bottom
with
the
front
door
at
the
end
of
the
row
five
at
the
top
five
in
the
middle
their
red
brick
their
black
glassy
stare
between
the
curtains
she
noticed
how
high
and
big
the
house
looked
on
its
slender
plot
of
grass
behind
the
brick
wall
that
held
up
the
low
iron
railing
a
tall
iron
gate
between
brown
brick
pillars
topped
by
stone
balls
a
flagged
path
to
the
front
door
crocuses
yellow
white
white
and
purple
growing
in
the
border
of
the
grass
plot
she
saw
them
for
the
first
time
the
front
door
stood
open
she
went
in
the
at
the
back
was
full
of
the
queer
white
light
things
stood
out
in
it
sharp
and
suddenly
strange
like
the
trees
and
houses
in
the
light
outside
the
satin
stripes
in
the
grey
damask
curtains
at
the
three
windows
the
rings
of
roses
on
the
grey
carpet
the
tarnished
pattern
on
the
grey
the
furniture
shining
like
dark
wine
the
fluted
emerald
green
silk
in
the
panel
of
the
piano
and
the
hanging
bag
of
the
the
small
flowers
on
the
pale
green
chintz
the
green
chinese
bowls
in
the
rosewood
cabinet
the
blue
and
red
parrot
on
the
chair
her
mother
sat
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
she
was
sorting
beads
into
trays
in
a
box
lined
with
sandal
wood
mary
stood
at
the
doorway
looking
in
swinging
her
hat
in
her
hand
suddenly
without
any
reason
she
was
so
happy
that
she
could
hardly
bear
it
mamma
looked
up
she
said
what
are
you
doing
standing
there
she
ran
to
her
and
hid
her
face
in
her
lap
she
caught
mamma
hands
and
kissed
them
they
smelt
of
sandal
wood
they
moved
over
her
hair
with
slight
quick
strokes
that
did
stay
that
did
care
mamma
said
there
that
do
that
do
she
climbed
up
on
a
chair
and
looked
out
of
the
window
she
could
see
mamma
small
beautiful
nose
bending
over
the
tray
of
beads
and
her
bright
eyes
that
slid
slantwise
to
look
at
her
and
under
the
window
she
saw
the
brown
twigs
of
the
lilac
bush
tipped
with
green
her
happiness
was
sharp
and
still
like
the
white
light
mamma
said
what
did
you
see
when
you
were
out
with
jenny
nothing
nothing
and
what
are
you
looking
at
nothing
mamma
then
go
upstairs
and
take
your
things
off
quick
she
went
very
slowly
holding
herself
with
care
lest
she
should
jar
her
happiness
and
spill
it
one
of
the
windows
of
her
room
was
open
she
stood
a
little
while
looking
out
beyond
the
wall
of
the
garden
she
saw
the
flat
furrowed
field
stripes
of
grey
earth
and
vivid
green
in
the
middle
of
the
field
the
five
elms
in
a
row
high
and
slender
four
standing
close
together
one
apart
each
held
up
a
small
rounded
top
fine
as
a
tuft
of
feathers
on
her
left
towards
ilford
a
very
long
row
of
high
elms
screened
off
the
bare
flats
from
the
village
where
it
ended
she
saw
drake
farm
black
timbered
barns
and
sallow
haystacks
beside
a
clump
of
trees
behind
the
five
elms
on
the
edge
of
the
earth
a
flying
line
of
trees
set
wide
apart
small
thin
trees
flying
away
low
down
under
the
sky
she
looked
and
looked
her
happiness
mixed
itself
up
with
the
queer
light
and
with
the
flat
fields
and
the
tall
bare
trees
she
turned
from
the
window
and
saw
the
vases
that
mamma
had
given
her
standing
on
the
the
black
birds
with
red
beaks
and
red
legs
looked
at
her
she
threw
herself
on
the
bed
and
pressed
her
face
into
the
pillow
and
cried
mamma
mamma
iv
passion
week
it
gave
you
an
awful
feeling
of
something
going
to
happen
in
the
long
narrow
the
sunlight
through
the
three
windows
made
a
strange
and
solemn
blue
colour
in
the
dark
curtains
mamma
sat
up
at
the
mahogany
table
looking
sad
and
serious
with
the
prayer
book
open
before
her
at
the
litany
when
you
went
in
you
knew
that
you
would
have
to
read
about
the
crucifixion
nothing
could
save
you
still
you
did
find
out
things
about
god
in
the
epistle
it
said
art
thou
red
in
thine
apparel
and
thy
garments
like
him
that
treadeth
the
i
have
trodden
the
alone
and
of
the
people
there
was
none
with
me
for
i
will
tread
them
in
my
anger
and
trample
them
in
my
fury
and
their
blood
shall
be
sprinkled
upon
my
garments
and
i
will
stain
all
my
raiment
the
passion
meant
that
god
had
flown
into
another
temper
and
that
jesus
was
crucified
to
make
him
good
again
mark
said
you
must
say
that
to
mamma
but
he
owned
that
it
looked
like
it
anyhow
it
was
easier
to
think
of
it
that
way
than
to
think
that
god
sent
jesus
down
to
be
crucified
because
you
were
naughty
there
were
no
verses
in
the
bible
only
long
grey
slabs
like
tombstones
you
kept
on
looking
for
the
last
tombstone
when
you
came
to
the
one
with
the
big
black
letters
the
king
of
the
jews
you
knew
that
it
would
soon
be
over
clothed
him
with
purple
and
platted
a
crown
of
thorns
and
put
it
on
his
head
she
read
obediently
when
the
sixth
hour
was
come
and
when
the
sixth
hour
was
come
there
was
darkness
over
the
whole
land
until
the
ninth
hour
and
at
the
ninth
hour
jesus
cried
out
with
a
loud
voice
and
jesus
cried
with
a
loud
voice
with
a
loud
voice
and
gave
up
the
ghost
mamma
was
saying
that
the
least
you
could
do
was
to
pay
attention
but
you
could
pay
attention
every
time
the
first
time
it
was
beautiful
and
terrible
but
after
many
times
the
beauty
went
and
you
were
only
frightened
when
she
tried
to
think
about
the
crown
of
thorns
she
thought
of
the
new
hat
catty
had
bought
for
easter
sunday
and
what
spall
did
when
he
ate
the
parsnips
through
the
barred
windows
of
the
basement
she
could
hear
catty
singing
in
the
pantry
am
so
glad
that
jesus
loves
me
jesus
loves
me
jesus
loves
me
catty
was
happy
when
she
sang
and
danced
round
and
round
with
the
and
jenny
and
spall
were
happy
when
they
talked
about
jesus
but
mamma
was
not
happy
she
had
had
to
read
the
morning
prayer
and
the
psalms
and
the
lessons
and
the
litany
to
herself
every
morning
and
by
thursday
she
was
tired
and
cross
passion
week
gave
you
an
awful
feeling
good
friday
would
be
the
worst
it
was
the
real
day
that
jesus
died
there
would
be
the
sixth
hour
and
the
ninth
hour
perhaps
there
would
be
a
darkness
but
when
good
friday
came
you
found
a
smoking
bun
on
everybody
plate
at
breakfast
tasting
of
spice
and
butter
and
you
went
to
aldborough
hatch
for
service
she
thought
if
the
darkness
does
come
it
wo
be
so
bad
to
bear
at
aldborough
hatch
she
liked
the
new
church
with
the
clear
windows
where
you
could
stand
on
the
hassock
and
look
out
at
the
green
hill
framed
in
the
white
arch
that
was
chigwell
is
a
green
hill
far
without
a
city
wall
the
green
hill
had
got
any
city
wall
epping
forest
and
hainault
forest
were
there
you
could
think
of
them
or
you
could
look
at
propart
nice
face
while
he
read
about
the
crucifixion
and
preached
about
god
mercy
and
his
justice
he
did
it
all
in
a
soothing
inattentive
voice
and
when
he
had
finished
he
went
quick
into
the
vestry
as
if
he
were
glad
it
was
all
over
and
when
you
met
him
at
the
gate
he
did
look
as
if
good
friday
mattered
very
much
in
the
afternoon
she
forgot
all
about
the
sixth
hour
and
the
ninth
hour
just
as
she
was
going
to
think
about
them
mark
and
dank
put
her
in
the
dirty
and
rolled
her
down
the
back
stairs
to
make
her
happy
they
shut
themselves
up
in
the
pantry
till
she
had
stopped
laughing
and
when
catty
opened
the
door
the
clock
struck
and
mark
said
that
was
the
ninth
hour
it
was
all
over
and
nothing
had
happened
nothing
at
all
only
when
you
thought
of
what
had
been
done
to
jesus
it
did
seem
right
somehow
to
have
eaten
the
buns
grandmamma
and
grandpapa
olivier
were
buried
in
the
city
of
london
cemetery
a
long
time
ago
so
long
that
even
mark
could
remember
it
uncle
victor
had
brought
grandmamma
in
a
coffin
all
the
way
from
liverpool
to
london
in
the
train
on
saturday
afternoon
mamma
had
to
put
flowers
on
the
grave
for
easter
sunday
because
of
uncle
victor
and
aunt
lavvy
she
took
roddy
and
mary
with
her
they
drove
in
parish
wagonette
and
called
for
aunt
lavvy
at
uncle
victor
tall
white
house
at
the
bottom
of
ilford
high
street
aunt
lavvy
was
on
the
steps
waiting
for
them
holding
a
big
cross
of
white
flowers
you
could
see
aunt
charlotte
face
at
the
window
looking
out
over
the
top
of
the
brown
wire
blind
she
had
her
hat
on
as
if
she
had
expected
to
be
taken
too
her
eyes
were
sharp
and
angry
and
uncle
victor
stood
behind
her
with
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
aunt
lavvy
gave
mary
the
flower
cross
and
climbed
stiffly
into
the
wagonette
mary
felt
grown
up
and
important
holding
the
big
cross
on
her
knee
the
white
flowers
gave
out
a
thick
sweet
smell
as
they
drove
away
she
kept
on
thinking
about
aunt
charlotte
and
about
uncle
victor
bringing
grandmamma
in
a
coffin
in
the
train
it
was
very
very
brave
of
him
she
was
sorry
for
aunt
charlotte
aunt
charlotte
had
wanted
to
go
to
the
cemetery
and
they
had
let
her
go
perhaps
she
was
still
looking
over
the
blind
sharp
and
angry
because
they
would
let
her
go
aunt
lavvy
said
we
could
take
charlotte
it
excited
her
too
much
last
time
as
if
she
knew
what
you
were
thinking
the
wagonette
stopped
by
the
at
manor
park
and
they
got
out
mamma
told
parish
to
drive
round
to
the
leytonstone
side
and
wait
for
them
there
at
the
big
gates
they
wanted
to
walk
through
the
cemetery
and
see
what
was
to
be
seen
beyond
the
a
muddy
lane
went
along
a
field
of
coarse
grass
under
a
hedge
of
thorns
and
ended
at
a
paling
roddy
whispered
excitedly
that
they
were
in
wanstead
flats
the
hedge
shut
off
the
cemetery
from
the
flats
through
thin
places
in
the
thorn
bushes
you
could
see
tombstones
very
white
tombstones
against
very
dark
trees
there
was
a
black
wooden
door
in
the
hedge
for
you
to
go
in
by
the
lane
and
the
thorn
bushes
and
the
black
door
reminded
mary
of
something
she
had
seen
before
somewhere
something
frightening
when
they
got
through
the
black
door
there
were
no
tombstones
what
showed
through
the
hedge
were
the
tops
of
high
white
pillars
standing
up
among
trees
a
long
way
off
they
had
come
into
a
dreadful
bare
plain
furrowed
into
low
mounds
as
if
a
plough
had
gone
over
it
you
saw
nothing
but
mounds
some
of
them
were
made
of
loose
earth
some
were
patched
over
with
rough
sods
that
gaped
in
a
horrible
way
perhaps
if
you
looked
through
the
cracks
you
would
see
down
into
the
grave
where
the
coffin
was
the
mounds
had
a
fresh
raw
look
as
if
all
the
people
in
the
city
of
london
had
died
and
been
buried
hurriedly
the
night
before
and
there
were
no
stones
with
names
only
small
flat
sticks
at
one
end
of
each
grave
to
show
where
the
heads
were
roddy
said
we
got
to
go
all
through
this
to
get
to
the
other
side
they
could
see
mamma
and
aunt
lavvy
a
long
way
on
in
front
picking
their
way
gingerly
among
the
furrows
if
only
mark
had
been
there
instead
of
roddy
roddy
keep
on
saying
the
great
plague
of
london
the
great
plague
of
london
to
frighten
himself
he
pointed
to
a
heap
of
earth
and
said
it
was
the
first
plague
pit
in
the
middle
of
the
plain
she
saw
people
in
black
walking
slowly
and
crookedly
behind
a
coffin
that
went
staggering
on
black
legs
under
a
black
pall
she
tried
not
to
look
at
them
when
she
looked
again
they
had
stopped
beside
a
heap
that
roddy
said
was
the
second
plague
pit
men
in
black
crawled
out
from
under
the
coffin
as
they
put
it
down
she
could
see
the
bulk
of
it
flattened
out
under
the
black
pall
against
the
raw
ochreish
ground
the
figures
of
two
mutes
stood
up
black
and
distinct
in
their
high
hats
tied
in
the
bunched
out
streaming
weepers
there
was
something
filthy
and
frightful
about
the
figures
of
the
mutes
and
when
they
dragged
the
pall
from
the
coffin
there
was
something
filthy
and
frightful
about
the
action
roddy
she
said
i
frightened
roddy
said
so
am
i
say
supposing
we
went
back
by
ourselves
across
wanstead
flats
he
was
excited
we
must
that
would
frighten
mamma
well
then
we
have
to
go
straight
through
they
went
slowly
between
the
rows
of
mounds
along
a
narrow
path
of
yellow
clay
that
squeaked
as
their
boots
went
in
and
out
roddy
held
her
hand
they
took
care
not
to
tread
on
the
graves
every
step
brought
them
nearer
to
the
funeral
they
had
pointed
it
out
to
each
other
they
had
pretended
it
was
there
now
it
was
no
use
pretending
they
could
see
the
coffin
roddy
i
ca
i
ca
go
past
the
funeral
we
got
to
he
looked
at
her
with
solemn
eyes
wide
open
in
his
beautiful
face
he
was
not
really
frightened
he
was
only
trying
to
be
because
he
liked
it
they
went
on
the
tight
feeling
under
her
waist
had
gone
her
body
felt
loose
and
light
as
if
it
did
belong
to
her
her
knees
were
soft
and
sank
under
her
suddenly
she
let
go
roddy
hand
she
stared
at
the
funeral
paralysed
with
fright
at
the
end
of
the
path
mamma
and
aunt
lavvy
stood
and
beckoned
to
them
aunt
lavvy
was
coming
towards
them
carrying
her
white
flower
cross
they
broke
into
a
stumbling
nightmare
run
the
bare
clay
plain
stretched
on
past
the
place
where
mamma
and
aunt
lavvy
had
turned
the
mounds
here
were
big
and
high
they
found
mamma
and
aunt
lavvy
standing
by
a
very
deep
and
narrow
pit
a
man
was
climbing
up
out
of
the
pit
on
a
ladder
you
could
see
a
pool
of
water
shining
far
down
at
the
bottom
mamma
was
smiling
gently
and
kindly
at
the
man
and
asking
him
why
the
grave
was
dug
so
deep
he
said
why
because
this
lot
and
that
there
what
you
come
acrost
is
the
pauper
buryin
ground
we
shovel
in
five
at
a
time
this
end
roddy
said
like
they
did
in
the
great
plague
of
london
i
do
know
about
no
plague
but
there
five
coffins
in
each
of
these
here
graves
piled
one
atop
of
the
other
mamma
seemed
inclined
to
say
more
to
the
but
aunt
lavvy
frowned
and
shook
her
head
at
her
and
they
went
on
to
where
a
path
of
coarse
grass
divided
the
pauper
burying
ground
from
the
rest
they
were
now
quite
horribly
near
the
funeral
and
going
down
the
grass
path
they
saw
another
that
came
towards
them
the
palled
coffin
swaying
on
headless
shoulders
they
turned
from
it
into
a
furrow
between
the
huddled
mounds
the
white
marble
columns
gleamed
nearer
among
the
black
trees
they
crossed
a
smooth
gravel
walk
into
a
crowded
town
of
dead
people
tombstones
as
far
as
you
could
see
upright
stones
flat
slabs
rounded
slabs
slabs
like
coffins
stone
boxes
with
flat
tops
broken
columns
pointed
pillars
rows
of
tall
black
trees
here
and
there
a
single
tree
sticking
up
stiffly
among
the
tombstones
very
little
trees
that
were
queer
and
terrifying
people
in
black
moving
about
the
tombstones
a
broad
road
and
a
grey
chapel
with
pointed
gables
under
a
black
tree
a
square
plot
enclosed
by
iron
railings
grandmamma
and
grandpapa
olivier
were
buried
in
one
half
of
the
plot
under
a
white
marble
slab
in
the
other
half
on
the
bare
grass
a
white
marble
curb
marked
out
a
place
for
another
grave
roddy
said
who
buried
there
mamma
said
nobody
yet
that
for
mary
saw
aunt
lavvy
frown
again
and
put
her
finger
to
her
mouth
she
said
who
for
who
an
appalling
curiosity
and
fear
possessed
her
and
when
aunt
lavvy
took
her
hand
she
knew
that
the
empty
place
was
marked
out
for
mamma
and
papa
outside
the
cemetery
gates
in
the
white
road
the
black
funeral
horses
tossed
their
heads
and
neighed
and
the
black
plumes
quivered
on
the
hearses
in
the
wagonette
she
sat
close
beside
aunt
lavvy
with
aunt
lavvy
shawl
over
her
eyes
she
wondered
how
she
knew
that
you
were
frightened
when
mamma
did
mamma
could
because
she
was
brave
she
was
afraid
of
the
funeral
when
roddy
said
she
ought
to
have
taken
us
she
ought
to
have
known
it
would
frighten
us
mark
was
angry
with
him
he
said
she
thought
you
like
it
you
little
beast
because
of
the
wagonette
darling
mamma
she
had
taken
them
because
she
thought
they
would
like
it
because
of
the
wagonette
because
she
was
brave
like
mark
vi
dead
people
really
did
rise
supposing
all
the
dead
people
in
the
city
of
london
cemetery
rose
and
came
out
of
their
graves
and
went
about
the
city
supposing
they
walked
out
as
far
as
ilford
crowds
and
crowds
of
them
in
white
sheets
supposing
they
got
into
the
garden
please
god
keep
me
from
thinking
about
the
resurrection
please
god
keep
me
from
dreaming
about
coffins
and
funerals
and
ghosts
and
skeletons
and
corpses
she
said
it
last
after
the
blessings
so
that
god
forget
but
it
was
no
use
if
you
said
texts
thou
shalt
not
be
afraid
for
the
terror
by
night
yea
though
i
walk
through
the
city
of
london
cemetery
it
was
no
use
the
trumpet
shall
sound
and
the
dead
shall
arise
incorruptible
that
was
beautiful
like
a
bright
light
shining
but
you
could
think
about
it
long
enough
and
the
dreams
went
on
just
the
same
the
dream
of
the
ghost
in
the
passage
the
dream
of
the
black
coffin
coming
round
the
turn
of
the
staircase
and
squeezing
you
against
the
banister
the
dream
of
the
corpse
that
came
to
your
bed
she
could
see
the
round
back
and
the
curled
arms
under
the
white
sheet
the
dreams
woke
her
with
a
sort
of
burst
her
heart
was
jumping
about
and
thumping
her
face
and
hair
were
wet
with
water
that
came
out
of
her
skin
the
grey
light
in
the
passage
was
like
the
of
the
dreams
gas
light
was
a
good
light
but
when
you
turned
it
on
jenny
came
up
and
put
it
out
again
she
said
goodness
knows
when
you
get
to
sleep
with
light
flaring
there
was
never
anybody
about
at
bedtime
jenny
was
dishing
up
the
dinner
harriet
was
waiting
catty
only
ran
up
for
a
minute
to
undo
the
hooks
and
brush
your
hair
when
mamma
sent
her
to
bed
she
came
creeping
back
into
the
everybody
was
eating
dinner
she
sickened
with
fright
in
the
steam
and
smell
of
dinner
she
leaned
her
head
against
mamma
and
whimpered
and
mamma
said
in
her
soft
voice
big
girls
do
cry
because
it
only
silly
baby
girls
are
afraid
of
ghosts
mamma
was
afraid
when
she
cried
mark
left
his
dinner
and
carried
her
upstairs
past
the
place
where
the
ghost
was
and
stayed
with
her
till
catty
came

but
mamma
had
gone
back
into
the
garden

at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
mary
stood
at
the
turn
she
had
one
hand
on
the
rail
of
the
banister
the
other
pressed
hard
against
the
wall
she
leaned
forward
on
tiptoe
measuring
her
distance
when
she
looked
at
the
stairs
they
fell
from
under
her
in
a
grey
dizziness
so
that
mark
looked
very
far
away
they
waited
till
papa
had
gone
back
into
the
library
mark
held
out
his
arms
jump
minky
jump
she
let
go
the
rail
and
drew
herself
up
a
delicious
thrill
of
danger
went
through
her
and
out
at
her
fingers
she
flung
herself
into
space
and
mark
caught
her
his
body
felt
hard
and
strong
as
it
received
her
they
did
it
again
and
again
that
was
the
you
knew
that
you
would
be
killed
if

did
catch
you

you
had
faith
that

would
catch
you
and
he

her
trowel
and
gardening
gloves

she
hated

mark
would
leave
napoleon
buonaparte

plantations
runs
into
the
lake
below
vinings
where
there
was
no
place
for
a
little
girl
of

to
cross
he
carried
her
in
his
arms
and

stand
outside

the
lane
and
put
his
hands
on
the
wall

pool
of

a
little
humbug
when
she
said

afraid
to

for
a
walk
with
jenny
lest
a
funeral
should
be
coming
along
the

strong
light

crackling
air
above

come
in

mamma
and
me

minute
papa
would

not
enough
to

mamma
would
be
happy
without
him
we

soon
iii

sedan
sedan
papa
came
out
into
the
garden
where
mamma
was
pulling
weeds
out
of
the
hot
dry
soil
he
flapped
the
newspaper
and
read
about
the
battle
of
sedan
mamma
left
off
pulling
weeds
out
and
listened
mark
had
stuck
the
picture
of
marshal
mcmahon
over
the
schoolroom
papa
had
pinned
the
to
the
library
door
mark
was
restless
he
kept
on
going
into
the
library
to
look
at
the
and
papa
kept
on
turning
him
out
again
he
was
in
a
sort
of
mysterious
disgrace
because
of
sedan
roddy
was
excited
about
sedan
dan
followed
mark
as
he
went
in
and
out
he
was
furious
with
papa
because
of
mark
mamma
had
been
a
long
time
in
the
library
talking
to
papa
they
sent
for
mark
just
before
when
mary
ran
in
to
say
she
found
him
there
mark
was
saying
you

beastly
money

what
your
mother
says

enough
for
you
mark
loved
mamma
but
he
was
not
going
to
do
what
she
wanted
he
was
going
to
do
something
that
would
kill
her
iv
papa
walked
in
the
garden
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
like
the
lord
god
and
he
was
always
alone
when
you
thought
of
him
you
thought
of
jehovah
there
was
something
funny
about
other
people
fathers
manisty
of
vinings
who
rode
along
ley
street
with
his
two
tall
thin
sons
as
if
he
were
actually
proud
of
them
batty
the
vicar
of
barkingside
who
called
his
daughter
isabel
his
pretty
one
farmer
the
curate
of
mary
chapel
who
walked
up
and
down
the
room
all
night
with
the
baby
and
propart
who
went
about
the
public
roads
with
humphrey
and
arthur
positively
hanging
on
him
dan
said
humphrey
and
arthur
were
tame
and
domestic
because
they
were
always
going
about
with
propart
and
talking
to
him
as
if
they
liked
it
mark
had
once
seen
propart
trying
to
jump
a
ditch
on
the
aldborough
road
it
was
ridiculous
humphrey
and
arthur
had
to
grab
him
by
the
arms
and
pull
him
over
mary
was
sorry
for
the
propart
boys
because
they
had
got
a
mother
who
was
sweet
and
pretty
like
mamma
and
a
father
called
emilius
olivier
emilius
jump
ditches
any
more
than
propart
but
then
he
knew
he
could
and
as
mark
said
he
had
the
jolly
good
sense
not
to
try
you
could
be
jehovah
and
jump
ditches
emilius
olivier
was
everything
a
father
ought
to
be
then
suddenly
for
no
reason
at
all
he
left
off
being
jehovah
and
began
trying
to
behave
like
batty
it
was
at
dinner
the
last
sunday
before
the
thirteenth
mamma
had
moved
roddy
and
mary
from
their
places
so
that
mark
and
dan
could
sit
beside
her
mary
was
sitting
at
the
right
hand
of
papa
in
the
glory
of
the
father
the
pudding
had
come
in
and
mark
pudding
with
whipped
cream
hiding
the
raspberry
jam
it
was
roddy
turn
to
be
helped
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
pure
shuddering
in
the
glass
dish
and
mamma
had
just
asked
him
which
he
would
have
when
papa
sent
mark
and
dan
out
of
the
room
you
could
think
why
he
had
done
it
this
time
unless
it
was
because
mark
laughed
when
roddy
said
in
his
proud
dignified
voice
i
have
a
little
piece
of
the
virgin
womb
please
first
or
it
may
have
been
because
of
mark
pudding
he
never
liked
it
when
they
had
mark
pudding
anyhow
mark
and
dan
had
to
go
and
as
they
went
he
drew
mary
chair
closer
to
him
and
heaped
her
plate
with
cream
and
jam
looking
very
straight
at
mamma
as
he
did
it
you
might
have
left
them
alone
mamma
said
on
their
last
sunday
they
wo
be
here
to
annoy
you
so
very
long
papa
said
there
are
three
days
yet
till
the
thirteenth
three
days
you
count
the
hours
and
the
minutes
till
you
got
what
you
want
what
i
want
is
peace
and
quiet
in
my
house
and
to
get
a
word
in
edgeways
sometimes
with
my
own
wife
you
no
business
to
have
a
wife
if
you
ca
put
up
with
your
own
children
it
is
my
business
to
have
a
wife
papa
said
it
my
pleasure
my
business
is
to
insure
ships
and
you
see
me
putting
up
with
mary
very
well
i
suppose
she
my
own
child
mark
and
dan
are
your
own
children
first
they
to
judge
by
your
infatuation
i
should
have
said
they
were
mary
quite
contrary
how
does
your
garden
grow
silver
bells
and
cockle
shells
and
chocolate
creams
all
in
a
row
he
took
a
large
flat
box
of
chocolates
out
of
his
pocket
and
laid
it
beside
her
plate
and
he
looked
straight
at
mamma
again
if
those
are
the
chocolates
i
reminded
you
to
get
for
for
the
hamper
i
wo
have
them
opened
they
are
the
chocolates
you
reminded
me
to
get
for
the
hamper
i
suppose
mark
stomach
a
hamper
they
are
the
chocolates
i
reminded
myself
to
get
for
mary
then
mamma
said
a
peculiar
thing
are
you
trying
to
show
me
that
you
not
jealous
of
mary
i
not
trying
to
show
you
anything
you
know
i
not
jealous
of
mary
and
you
know
there
no
reason
why
i
should
be
to
hear
you
emilius
anybody
would
think
i
was
fond
of
my
own
daughter
mary
darling
you
better
run
away
and
mary
darling
he
mocked
her
you
better
take
your
chocolates
with
you
mary
said
i

chocolates
papa
is
that
her
contrariness
or
just
her
mariness
whatever
it
is
it
all
the
thanks
get
and
serve
you
right
too
said
mamma
she
went
upstairs
to
persuade
dan
that
papa
did
mean
it
it
was
just
his
way
and
they
see
he
would
be
different
but
and
the
next
day
and
the
next
he
was
the
same
he
actually
send
mark
and
dan
out
of
the
room
again
but
he
tried
to
pretend
to
himself
that
they
were
there
by
refusing
to
speak
to
them
do
you
think
mark
said
he
keep
it
up
till
the
last
minute
he
did
even
when
he
heard
the
sound
of
parish
wagonette
in
the
road
coming
to
take
mark
and
dan
away
they
were
sitting
at
breakfast
trying
not
to
look
at
him
for
fear
they
should
laugh
or
at
mamma
for
fear
they
should
cry
trying
not
to
look
at
each
other
catty
brought
in
the
cakes
the
hot
buttered
yorkshire
cakes
that
were
never
served
for
breakfast
except
on
christmas
day
and
birthdays
mary
wondered
whether
papa
would
say
or
do
anything
he
could
everybody
knew
those
cakes
were
sacred
catty
set
them
on
the
table
with
a
sort
of
crash
and
ran
out
of
the
room
crying
mamma
mouth
quivered
papa
looked
at
the
cakes
he
looked
at
mamma
he
looked
at
mark
mark
was
staring
at
nothing
with
a
firm
grin
on
his
face
the
assuagers
of
grief
papa
said
pass
round
the
assuagers
the
holy
cakes
were
passed
round
everybody
took
a
piece
except
dan
papa
pressed
him
try
an
assuager
do
and
mamma
pleaded
yes
dank
do
you
hear
what
your
mother
says
dan
eyes
were
he
took
a
double
section
of
cake
and
tried
to
bite
his
way
through
at
the
first
taste
tears
came
out
of
his
eyes
and
fell
on
his
cake
and
when
mamma
saw
that
she
burst
out
crying
mary
put
her
piece
down
untasted
and
bit
back
her
sobs
roddy
pushed
his
piece
away
and
mark
began
to
eat
his
suddenly
bowing
over
it
with
an
affectation
of
enjoyment
outside
in
the
road
parish
was
descending
from
the
box
of
his
wagonette
papa
looked
at
his
watch
he
was
going
with
them
to
chelmsted
and
mamma
whispered
to
mark
and
dan
with
her
last
kiss
he
be
all
right
in
the
train
it
was
all
over
mary
and
roddy
sat
in
the
where
mamma
had
left
them
they
had
shut
their
eyes
so
as
not
to
see
the
empty
chairs
pushed
back
and
the
pieces
of
the
sacred
cakes
bitten
and
abandoned
they
had
stopped
their
ears
so
as
not
to
hear
the
wheels
of
wagonette
taking
mark
and
dan
away
hours
afterwards
mamma
came
upon
mary
huddled
up
in
a
corner
of
the
mamma
mamma
i
bear
it
i
ca
live
without
mark
and
dan
mamma
sat
down
and
took
her
in
her
arms
and
rocked
her
rocked
her
without
a
word
soothing
her
own
grief
papa
found
them
like
that
when
he
came
back
from
chelmsted
he
stood
in
the
doorway
looking
at
them
for
a
moment
then
slunk
out
of
the
room
as
if
he
were
ashamed
of
himself
when
mamma
sent
mary
out
to
say
to
him
he
was
standing
beside
the
little
sumach
tree
that
mark
gave
mamma
on
her
birthday
he
was
smiling
at
the
sumach
tree
as
if
he
loved
it
and
was
sorry
for
it
and
mamma
got
a
letter
from
mark
in
the
morning
to
say
she
was
right
papa
had
been
quite
decent
in
the
train
after
mark
and
dan
had
gone
a
great
and
very
remarkable
change
came
over
papa
and
mamma
mamma
left
off
saying
the
funny
things
that
mary
could
not
understand
and
papa
left
off
teasing
and
flying
into
tempers
and
looking
like
jehovah
and
walking
by
himself
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
he
followed
mamma
about
the
garden
he
hung
over
her
chair
like
mark
as
she
sat
sewing
you
came
upon
him
suddenly
on
the
stairs
and
in
the
passages
and
he
would
look
at
you
as
if
you
were
not
there
and
say
where
your
mother
go
and
tell
her
i
want
her
and
mamma
would
put
away
her
trowel
and
her
big
leather
gloves
and
go
to
him
she
would
sit
for
hours
in
the
library
while
he
flapped
the
newspaper
and
read
to
her
in
a
loud
voice
about
gladstone
whom
she
hated
sometimes
he
would
come
home
early
from
the
office
and
mamma
and
mary
would
be
ready
for
him
and
they
would
all
go
together
to
call
at
vinings
or
barkingside
vicarage
or
on
the
proparts
or
parish
wagonette
would
be
ordered
and
mamma
and
mary
would
put
on
their
best
clothes
very
quick
and
go
up
to
london
with
him
and
he
would
take
them
to
paul
or
maskelyne
and
cooke
or
the
national
gallery
or
the
british
museum
or
they
would
walk
slowly
very
slowly
up
regent
street
stopping
at
the
windows
of
the
bonnet
shops
while
mamma
picked
out
the
bonnet
she
would
buy
if
she
could
afford
it
and
perhaps
the
next
day
a
bonnet
would
come
in
a
bandbox
a
bonnet
that
frightened
her
when
she
put
it
on
and
looked
at
herself
in
the
glass
she
would
pretend
it
was
one
of
the
bonnets
she
had
wanted
and
when
papa
had
forgotten
about
it
she
would
pull
all
the
trimming
off
and
put
it
all
on
again
a
different
way
and
papa
would
say
it
was
an
even
more
beautiful
bonnet
than
he
had
thought
you
might
have
supposed
that
he
was
sorry
because
he
was
thinking
about
mark
and
dan
and
trying
to
make
up
for
having
been
unkind
to
them
but
he
was
not
sorry
he
was
glad
glad
about
something
that
mamma
had
done
he
would
go
about
whistling
some
gay
tune
or
you
caught
him
stroking
his
moustache
and
parting
it
over
his
rich
lips
that
smiled
as
if
he
were
thinking
of
what
mamma
had
done
to
make
him
happy
the
red
specks
and
smears
had
gone
from
his
eyes
they
were
clear
and
blue
and
they
looked
at
you
with
a
kind
gentle
look
like
uncle
victor
his
very
beard
was
happy
you
may
not
know
it
but
your
father
is
the
handsomest
man
in
essex
mamma
said
perhaps
it
was
anything
that
mamma
had
done
perhaps
he
was
only
happy
because
he
was
being
good
every
sunday
he
went
to
church
at
barkingside
with
mamma
kneeling
close
to
her
in
the
big
pew
and
praying
in
a
great
ghostly
voice
good
lord
deliver
us
when
the
psalms
and
hymns
began
he
rose
over
the
yards
and
yards
of
him
as
if
he
stood
on
many
hassocks
and
he
lifted
up
his
beard
and
sang
all
these
times
the
air
fairly
tingled
with
him
he
seemed
to
beat
out
of
himself
and
spread
around
him
the
throb
of
violent
and
overpowering
life
and
in
the
evenings
towards
sunset
they
walked
together
in
the
fields
and
mary
followed
them
lagging
behind
in
the
borders
where
the
sharlock
and
wild
rye
and
poppies
grew
when
she
caught
up
with
them
she
heard
them
talking
once
mamma
said
why
ca
you
always
be
like
this
emilius
and
papa
said
why
indeed
and
when
christmas
came
and
mark
and
dan
were
back
again
he
was
as
cruel
and
teasing
as
he
had
ever
been
vi
eighteen
one
cold
day
roddy
walked
into
the
pool
of
siloam
to
recover
his
sailing
boat
which
had
drifted
under
the
long
arch
of
the
bridge
there
was
no
passion
week
and
no
good
friday
and
no
easter
that
spring
only
roddy
rheumatic
fever
roddy
in
bed
lying
on
his
back
his
face
white
and
sharp
his
hair
darkened
and
glued
with
the
sweat
that
poured
from
his
hair
and
soaked
into
the
bed
roddy
crying
out
with
pain
when
they
moved
him
mamma
and
jenny
always
in
roddy
room
sister
in
the
kitchen
mary
going
up
and
down
tiptoe
on
messages
trying
not
to
touch
roddy
bed
draper
calling
talking
in
a
low
voice
to
mamma
and
mamma
crying
draper
looking
at
you
through
his
spectacles
and
putting
a
thing
like
a
trumpet
to
your
chest
and
listening
through
it
you
quite
right
olivier
there
nothing
wrong
with
the
little
girl
heart
she
as
sound
as
a
bell
a
dreadful
feeling
that
you
had
no
business
to
be
as
sound
as
a
bell
it
was
fair
to
roddy
something
she
did
notice
at
the
time
and
remembered
afterwards
when
roddy
was
well
again
jenny
saying
to
mamma
if
it
had
to
be
one
of
them
it
had
ought
to
have
been
miss
mary
and
mamma
saying
to
jenny
it
would
have
mattered
so
much
if
it
had
been
the
girl
vii
you
knew
that
catty
loved
you
there
was
never
the
smallest
uncertainty
about
it
her
big
black
eyes
shone
when
she
saw
you
coming
you
kissed
her
smooth
cool
cheeks
and
she
hugged
you
tight
and
kissed
you
back
again
at
once
her
big
lips
made
a
noise
like
a
when
she
tucked
you
up
at
night
she
said
i
love
you
so
much
i
could
eat
you
and
she
would
play
any
game
you
liked
you
had
only
to
say
let
play
the
game
and
she
was
off
you
began
i
went
away
to
the
big
hot
river
where
the
rhinoceroses
and
hippopotamuses
are
or
i
went
away
to
the
desert
where
the
sand
is
to
catch
zebras
i
rode
on
a
dromedary
through
the
sand
and
catty
would
follow
it
up
with
i
went
away
with
the
good
templars
we
went
in
a
on
a
lake
and
we
landed
on
an
island
where
there
was
daffodillies
growing
we
had
milk
and
cake
and
it
blew
such
a
cool
breeze
catty
was
full
of
love
she
loved
her
father
and
mother
and
her
little
sister
amelia
better
than
anything
in
the
whole
world
her
home
was
in
wales
tears
came
into
her
eyes
when
she
thought
about
her
home
and
her
little
sister
amelia
catty
how
much
do
you
love
me
armfuls
and
armfuls
as
much
as
your
mother
very
near
as
much
as
much
as
amelia
every
bit
as
much
how
much
do
you
think
jenny
loves
me
ever
so
much
no
jenny
loves
roddy
best
then
mark
then
dank
then
mamma
then
papa
then
me
that
is
ever
so
much
catty
was
vexed
you
did
oughter
go
measuring
people
love
miss
mary
still
that
was
what
you
did
do
with
catty
and
jenny
you
could
measure
till
you
knew
exactly
where
you
were
mamma
was
different
you
knew
she
loved
you
you
could
almost
count
the
times
the
time
when
papa
frightened
you
the
time
when
you
cut
your
forehead
the
time
the
lamb
died
all
the
and
times
and
when
meta
the
wax
doll
fell
off
the
schoolroom
table
and
broke
her
head
and
when
mark
went
away
to
school
or
when
you
were
good
and
said
every
word
of
your
lessons
right
when
you
watched
mamma
working
in
the
garden
planting
and
transplanting
the
flowers
with
her
clever
hands
and
when
you
were
quiet
and
sat
beside
her
on
the
footstool
learning
to
knit
and
sew
on
sunday
afternoons
when
she
played
the
hymns
and
you
sang
there
a
friend
for
little
children
above
the
bright
blue
sky
quite
horribly
out
of
tune
and
when
you
listened
while
she
sang
herself
lead
kindly
light
or
abide
with
me
and
her
voice
was
so
sweet
and
gentle
that
it
made
you
cry
then
you
knew
sometimes
when
it
was
not
sunday
she
played
the
hungarian
march
that
went
with
loud
noble
noises
droom
droom
droom
droom
droom
droom
droom
droom
it
was
wonderful
mamma
was
wonderful
she
swayed
and
bowed
to
the
beat
of
the
music
as
if
she
shook
it
out
of
her
body
and
not
out
of
the
piano
she
smiled
to
herself
when
she
saw
that
you
were
listening
you
said
oh
mamma
play
it
again
and
she
played
it
again
when
she
had
finished
she
stooped
suddenly
and
kissed
you
and
you
knew
but
she
would
say
it

ca

see
what
i
doing
no
she
was
not
interested
in
the
thin
white
stuff
and
the
lace
well
then
look
in
the
basket
the
basket
was
full
of
tiny
garments
made
of
the
white
stuff
petticoats
drawers
and
nightgown
sewn
with
minute
tucks
and
edged
with
lace
mamma
unfolded
them
new
clothes
she
said
for
your
new
dolly
oh
oh
oh

you
so
much
that
i
ca

it
you
little
holy
mamma
mamma
said
i

and
i
wo

called
holy
i
want
deeds
not
words
if
you
love
me
you
learn
your
lessons
properly
the
night
before
not
just
gabble
them
over
hot
from
the
pan
i
will
mamma
i
will
wo
you
say
it
no
mamma
said
i
wo
she
sat
there
with
a
sort
of
triumph
on
her
beautiful
face
as
if
she
were
pleased
with
herself
because
she
had
said
it
and
mary
would
bring
the
long
sheet
that
dragged
on
her
wrist
and
the
needle
that
pricked
her
fingers
and
sit
at
mamma
knee
and
sew
making
a
thin
trail
of
blood
all
along
the
hem
why
do
you
look
at
me
so
kindly
when
i
sewing
because
i
like
to
see
you
behaving
like
a
little
girl
instead
of
tearing
about
and
trying
to
do
what
boys
do
and
mamma
would
tell
her
a
story
always
the
same
story
going
on
and
on
about
the
family
of
ten
children
who
lived
in
the
farm
by
the
forest
there
were
seven
boys
and
three
girls
the
six
youngest
boys
worked
on
the
farm
with
their
father
yes
he
was
a
nice
father
and
the
eldest
boy
worked
in
the
garden
with
his
mother
and
the
three
girls
worked
in
the
house
they
could
cook
and
make
butter
and
cheese
and
bake
bread
and
even
the
youngest
little
girl
could
knit
and
sew
had
they
any
children
no
they
were
too
busy
to
think
about
having
children
they
were
all
very
very
happy
together
just
as
they
were
the
story
was
like
the
hem
there
was
never
any
end
to
it
for
mamma
was
always
finding
something
else
for
the
three
girls
to
do
she
smiled
as
she
told
it
as
if
she
saw
something
that
pleased
her
mary
felt
that
she
could
go
on
sewing
at
the
hem
and
pricking
her
finger
for
ever
if
mamma
would
only
keep
that
look
on
her
face
viii
i
i
ca
jenny
i
ca
i
know
there
a
funeral
coming
mary
stood
on
the
flagstone
inside
the
arch
of
the
open
gate
she
looked
up
and
down
the
road
and
drew
back
again
into
the
garden
jenny
tired
and
patient
waited
outside
i
told
you
miss
mary
there
is
any
funeral
if
there
is
there
will
be
there
i
can
see
it
you
see
parish
high
a
driving
in
his
wagonette
it
parish
high
hat
when
he
put
the
black
top
on
his
wagonette
it
looked
like
a
hearse
they
started
up
ley
street
towards
spall
cottage
jenny
said
i
thought
you
was
going
to
be
such
a
good
girl
when
master
roddy
went
to
school
but
i
declare
if
you
not
twice
as
tiresome
roddy
had
gone
to
chelmsted
after
midsummer
she
had
to
go
for
walks
on
the
roads
with
jenny
now
at
the
risk
of
meeting
funerals
this
week
they
had
been
every
day
to
ilford
to
call
at
cottage
or
at
benny
the
draper
shop
in
the
high
street
jenny
did
believe
that
a
big
girl
nine
next
birthday
could
really
be
afraid
of
funerals
she
thought
you
were
only
trying
to
be
tiresome
she
said
you
could
stop
thinking
about
funerals
well
enough
when
you
wanted
you
did
forget
sometimes
when
nice
things
happened
when
you
went
to
see
farmer
baby
undressed
and
when
isabel
batty
came
to
tea
isabel
was
almost
a
baby
it
felt
nice
to
lift
her
and
curl
up
her
stiff
hair
and
sponge
her
weak
pink
silk
hands
and
there
were
things
that
you
could
do
you
could
pretend
that
you
were
not
mary
olivier
but
somebody
else
that
you
were
and
that
the
baby
and
isabel
belonged
to
you
and
were
there
when
they
were
not
there
but
all
the
time
you
knew
there
would
be
a
funeral
on
the
road
somewhere
and
that
some
day
you
would
see
it
when
they
got
into
the
high
street
the
funeral
was
coming
along
the
barking
road
she
saw
before
jenny
could
see
anything
at
all
the
mutes
sitting
high
and
their
black
weepers
she
turned
and
ran
out
of
the
high
street
and
back
over
the
railway
bridge
jenny
called
after
her
come
back
and
a
man
on
the
bridge
shouted
hi
missy
stop
as
she
ran
down
ley
street
her
legs
shook
and
gave
way
under
her
once
she
fell
she
ran
staggering
but
she
ran
people
came
out
of
their
cottages
to
look
at
her
she
thought
they
had
come
out
to
look
at
the
funeral
after
that
she
refused
to
go
outside
the
front
door
or
to
look
through
the
front
windows
for
fear
she
should
see
a
funeral
they
could
take
her
and
carry
her
out
so
they
let
her
go
for
walks
in
the
back
garden
when
papa
came
home
she
was
sent
up
to
the
schoolroom
to
play
with
the
doll
house
you
could
see
the
road
through
the
high
bars
of
the
window
at
the
end
of
the
passage
so
that
even
when
catty
lit
the
gas
the
top
floor
was
queer
and
horrible
sometimes
doubts
came
with
her
terror
she
thought
nobody
loves
me
except
mark
and
mark
is
here
mark
image
haunted
her
she
shut
her
eyes
and
it
slid
forward
on
to
the
darkness
the
strong
body
the
brave
straight
up
and
down
face
the
steady
light
brown
eyes
shining
the
firm
sweet
mouth
the
hair
with
feathery
golden
tips
she
could
hear
mark
voice
calling
to
her
minx
minky
and
there
was
something
that
mamma
said
it
was
unkind
to
be
afraid
of
the
poor
dead
people
mamma
said
would
you
run
away
from
isabel
if
you
saw
her
lying
in
her
little
coffin
ii
jenny
new
dress
had
come
it
was
made
of
grey
silk
trimmed
with
black
lace
and
it
lay
spread
out
on
the
bed
in
the
spare
room
mamma
and
aunt
bella
stood
and
looked
at
it
and
shook
their
heads
as
if
they
thought
that
jenny
had
no
business
to
wear
a
silk
dress
aunt
bella
said
she
a
silly
woman
to
go
and
leave
a
good
home
at
her
age
and
mamma
said
i
rather
see
her
in
her
coffin
it
would
be
less
undignified
she
meant
to
do
it
at
easter
she
was
only
waiting
till
roddy
went
to
school
she
waiting
now
till
after
the
christmas
holidays
jenny
was
going
to
do
something
dreadful
she
was
going
to
be
married
the
grey
silk
dress
was
her
she
was
going
to
marry
spall
even
catty
thought
it
was
rather
dreadful
but
jenny
was
happy
because
she
was
going
to
wear
the
grey
silk
dress
and
live
in
spall
cottage
and
talk
to
him
about
jesus
only
one
half
of
her
face
drooped
sleepily
the
other
half
had
waked
up
and
looked
excited
there
was
a
flush
on
it
as
bright
as
paint
iii
mary
bed
stood
in
a
corner
of
the
night
nursery
and
beside
it
was
the
high
yellow
linen
cupboard
when
the
doors
were
opened
there
was
a
faint
smell
from
the
mackintosh
sheet
that
had
been
put
away
on
the
top
shelf
one
night
she
was
wakened
by
catty
coming
into
the
room
and
opening
the
cupboard
doors
catty
climbed
on
a
chair
and
took
something
from
the
top
shelf
she
did
answer
when
mary
asked
what
she
was
doing
but
hurried
away
leaving
the
door
on
the
latch
her
feet
made
quick
thuds
along
the
passage
a
door
opened
and
shut
and
there
was
a
sound
of
papa
going
downstairs
somebody
came
up
softly
and
pulled
the
door
to
and
mary
went
to
sleep
again
when
she
woke
the
room
was
full
of
the
grey
light
that
frightened
her
but
she
was
not
frightened
she
woke
sitting
up
on
her
pillow
staring
into
the
grey
light
and
saying
to
herself
jenny
is
dead
but
she
was
not
afraid
of
jenny
the
stillness
in
her
heart
spread
into
the
grey
light
of
the
room
she
lay
back
waiting
for
seven
when
catty
would
come
and
call
her
at
seven
mamma
came
she
wore
the
dress
she
had
worn
last
night
and
she
was
crying
mary
said
you
have
got
to
say
it
i
know
jenny
is
dead
the
blinds
were
drawn
in
all
the
windows
when
she
and
mark
went
into
the
front
garden
to
look
for
snowdrops
in
the
border
by
the
kitchen
area
she
knew
that
jenny
dead
body
lay
on
the
sofa
under
the
kitchen
window
behind
the
blind
and
the
white
painted
iron
bars
she
hoped
that
she
would
not
have
to
see
it
but
she
was
not
afraid
of
jenny
dead
body
it
was
sacred
and
holy
she
wondered
why
mamma
sent
her
to
uncle
edward
and
aunt
bella
from
the
windows
of
chadwell
grange
you
could
look
beyond
aldborough
hatch
towards
wanstead
flats
and
the
city
of
london
cemetery
they
were
going
to
bury
jenny
there
she
stood
looking
out
quiet
not
crying
she
only
cried
at
night
when
she
thought
of
jenny
sitting
in
the
low
nursery
chair
tired
and
patient
drawing
back
from
her
violent
caresses
and
of
the
grey
silk
dress
laid
out
on
the
bed
in
the
spare
room
she
was
not
even
afraid
of
the
city
of
london
cemetery
when
mark
took
her
to
see
jenny
grave
jenny
grave
was
sacred
and
holy
ix
i
you
had
to
endure
hardness
after
you
were
nine
you
learnt
out
of
markham
history
of
england
and
you
were
not
allowed
to
read
the
conversations
between
richard
and
mary
and
markham
because
they
made
history
too
amusing
and
too
easy
to
remember
for
the
same
reason
you
translated
only
the
tight
dismal
pages
of
your
french
reader
and
anything
that
looked
like
an
interesting
story
was
forbidden
you
were
to
learn
for
the
sake
of
the
lesson
and
not
for
pleasure
sake
mamma
said
you
had
enough
pleasure
in
she
put
it
to
your
honour
not
to
skip
on
to
the
more
exciting
parts
when
you
had
finished
markham
you
began
smith
history
of
england
honour
was
safe
with
smith
he
made
history
very
hard
to
read
and
impossible
to
remember
the
bible
got
harder
too
you
knew
all
the
best
psalms
by
heart
and
the
stories
about
noah
ark
and
joseph
and
his
coat
of
many
colours
and
david
and
daniel
in
the
lions
den
you
had
to
go
straight
through
the
bible
now
skipping
leviticus
because
it
was
full
of
things
you
understand
when
you
had
done
with
moses
lifting
up
the
serpent
in
the
wilderness
you
had
to
read
about
aaron
and
the
sons
of
levi
and
the
and
the
tabernacle
and
the
ark
of
the
covenant
where
they
kept
the
five
golden
emerods
mamma
did
know
what
emerods
were
but
mark
said
they
were
a
kind
of
white
mice
you
learnt
old
testament
history
too
out
of
a
little
book
that
was
all
grey
slabs
of
print
and
dark
pictures
showing
the
earth
swallowing
up
korah
dathan
and
abiram
and
aaron
and
the
sons
of
levi
with
their
long
beards
and
high
hats
and
their
petticoats
swinging
incense
in
fits
of
temper
you
found
out
queerer
and
queerer
things
about
god
god
made
the
earth
swallow
up
korah
dathan
and
abiram
he
killed
poor
uzzah
because
he
put
out
his
hand
to
prevent
the
ark
of
the
covenant
falling
out
of
the
cart
even
david
said
he
did
know
how
on
earth
he
was
to
get
the
ark
along
at
that
rate
and
there
were
the
moabites
and
the
midianites
and
all
the
animals
the
bullocks
and
the
and
the
little
lambs
and
kids
when
you
asked
mamma
why
god
killed
people
she
said
it
was
because
he
was
just
as
well
as
merciful
and
it
was
the
old
story
he
hated
sin
disobedience
was
sin
and
uzzah
had
been
disobedient
as
for
the
lambs
and
the
jesus
had
done
away
with
all
that
he
was
god
son
and
he
had
propitiated
god
anger
and
satisfied
his
justice
when
he
shed
his
own
blood
on
the
cross
to
save
sinners
without
shedding
of
blood
there
is
no
remission
of
sins
you
were
not
to
bother
about
the
blood
but
you
could
help
bothering
about
it
you
could
help
being
sorry
for
uzzah
and
the
midianites
and
the
lambs
and
the
perhaps
you
had
to
sort
things
out
and
keep
them
separate
here
was
the
world
here
were
mamma
and
mark
and
kittens
and
rabbits
and
all
the
things
you
really
cared
about
drawing
pictures
and
playing
the
hungarian
march
and
getting
excited
in
the
easter
holidays
when
the
white
evenings
came
and
mark
raced
you
from
the
green
man
to
the
horns
tavern
here
was
the
sudden
secret
happiness
you
felt
when
you
were
by
yourself
and
the
fields
looked
beautiful
it
was
always
coming
now
with
a
sort
of
rush
and
flash
when
you
least
expected
it
and
was
god
and
religion
and
duty
the
nicest
part
of
religion
was
music
and
knowing
how
the
world
was
made
and
the
beautiful
sounding
bits
of
the
bible
you
could
like
religion
but
duty
was
doing
all
the
things
you
did
like
because
you
did
like
them
and
you
honestly
say
you
liked
god
god
had
to
be
propitiated
your
righteousness
was
filthy
rags
so
you
could
propitiate
him
jesus
had
to
do
it
for
you
all
you
had
to
do
was
to
believe
really
believe
that
he
had
done
it
but
supposing
you
had
got
to
believe
it
supposing
you
had
got
to
believe
anything
at
all
it
would
be
easier
to
think
about
the
things
you
cared
for
belonged
to
each
other
but
god
did
belong
to
them
he
did
fit
in
anywhere
you
could
help
feeling
that
if
god
was
love
and
if
he
was
everywhere
he
ought
to
have
fitted
in
perhaps
after
all
there
were
two
gods
one
who
made
things
and
loved
them
and
one
who
did
who
looked
on
sulking
and
finding
fault
with
what
the
clever
kind
god
had
made
when
the
midsummer
holidays
came
and
began
she
left
off
thinking
about
god
ii
uneasy
lies
the
head
that
wears
a
crown
the
picture
in
the
at
showed
the
old
king
in
bed
and
prince
hal
trying
on
his
crown
but
the
words
were
not
the
at
they
were
taken
out
of
shakespeare
mark
showed
her
the
place
mark
was
in
the
schoolroom
chanting
his
once
more
oh
ye
laurels
and
once
more
ye
myrtles
brown
with
ivy
never
sere
that
sounded
nice
say
it
again
mark
say
it
again
mark
said
it
again
he
also
said
wrath
to
greece
the
direful
spring
of
woes
unnumbered
heavenly
goddess
sing
the
three
books
stood
on
the
bookshelf
in
the
schoolroom
the
thin
shakespeare
in
diamond
print
the
small
brown
leather
milton
the
very
small
fat
pope
in
the
red
cover
mark
gave
them
to
her
for
her
own
she
made
catty
put
her
bed
between
the
two
windows
and
mark
made
a
bookshelf
out
of
a
piece
of
wood
and
some
picture
cord
and
hung
it
within
reach
she
had
a
happy
excited
feeling
when
she
thought
of
the
three
books
it
made
her
wake
early
she
read
from
five
till
catty
called
her
at
seven
and
again
after
catty
had
tucked
her
up
and
left
her
till
the
white
light
in
the
room
was
grey
she
learnt
by
heart
and
i
thought
i
saw
my
late
espoused
wife
brought
to
me
like
alcestis
from
the
grave
and
the
bits
about
satan
in
the
sound
of
the
lines
gave
her
the
same
nice
feeling
that
she
had
when
propart
played
the
march
in
scipio
after
evening
service
she
tried
to
make
lines
of
her
own
that
went
the
same
way
as
the
lines
in
milton
and
shakespeare
and
she
found
out
that
there
was
nothing
she
liked
so
much
as
making
these
lines
it
was
nicer
even
than
playing
the
hungarian
march
she
thought
it
was
funny
that
the
lines
like
pope
came
easiest
though
they
had
to
rhyme
silent
he
wandered
by
the
sounding
sea
was
good
but
the
greek
line
that
mark
showed
her
went
be
para
thina
poluphloisboio
thalasses
that
was
better
do
you
think
so
mark
clever
minx
much
better
mark
if
god
knew
how
happy
i
am
writing
poetry
he
make
the
earth
open
and
swallow
me
up
mark
only
said
you
must
say
that
to
mamma
play
of
all
hateful
and
disgusting
tunes
the
most
disgusting
and
the
most
hateful
was
violetta
which
sippett
sister
taught
her
but
if
mark
would
promise
to
make
mamma
let
her
learn
greek
she
would
play
it
to
him
twenty
times
running
when
mark
went
to
chelmsted
that
autumn
he
left
her
his
brown
and
smith
besides
macaulay
of
ancient
she
taught
herself
greek
in
the
hour
after
breakfast
before
miss
sippett
came
to
give
her
her
music
lesson
she
was
always
careful
to
leave
the
accidence
open
where
miss
sippett
could
see
it
and
realise
that
she
was
not
a
stupid
little
girl
but
whether
miss
sippett
saw
the
accidence
or
not
she
always
behaved
as
if
it
was
there
iii
when
mamma
saw
the
accidence
open
on
the
table
she
shut
it
and
told
you
to
put
it
in
its
proper
place
if
you
talked
about
it
her
mouth
buttoned
up
tight
and
her
eyes
blinked
and
she
began
tapping
with
her
foot
there
was
something
queer
about
learning
greek
mamma
did
not
actually
forbid
it
but
she
said
it
must
not
be
done
in
lesson
time
or
sewing
time
or
when
people
could
see
you
doing
it
lest
they
should
think
you
were
showing
off
you
could
see
that
she
did
believe
you
learn
greek
and
that
she
would
like
it
if
you
did
but
when
lessons
were
over
she
let
you
read
shakespeare
or
pope
aloud
to
her
while
she
sewed
and
when
you
could
say
lars
porsena
of
clusium
by
the
nine
gods
he
swore
straight
through
without
stopping
she
went
into
london
with
papa
and
brought
back
the
first
history
of
a
pinnock
of
in
a
blue
paper
cover
went
with
the
history
to
tell
you
all
about
the
gods
and
goddesses
what
pinnock
did
tell
you
you
found
out
from
smith
it
had
pictures
in
it
so
beautiful
that
you
were
happy
just
sitting
still
and
looking
at
them
there
was
such
a
lot
of
gods
and
goddesses
that
at
first
they
were
rather
hard
to
remember
but
you
could
forget
apollo
and
hermes
and
aphrodite
and
pallas
athene
and
diana
they
were
not
like
jehovah
they
quarrelled
sometimes
but
they
did
hate
each
other
not
as
jehovah
hated
all
the
other
gods
they
fitted
in
somehow
they
cared
for
all
the
things
you
liked
best
trees
and
animals
and
poetry
and
music
and
running
races
and
playing
games
even
zeus
was
nicer
than
jehovah
though
he
reminded
you
of
him
now
and
then
he
liked
sacrifices
but
then
he
was
honest
about
it
he
did
pretend
that
he
was
good
and
that
he
to
have
them
because
of
your
sins
and
you
had
got
to
believe
in
him
that
was
the
nicest
thing
of
all
x
mary
was
ten
in
eighteen
aunt
charlotte
was
ill
and
nobody
was
being
kind
to
her
she
had
given
her
sunday
bonnet
to
harriet
and
her
sunday
gown
to
catty
so
you
knew
she
was
going
to
be
married
again
she
said
it
was
prophesied
that
she
should
be
married
in
eighteen
the
illness
had
something
to
do
with
being
married
and
going
continually
to
marriott
church
and
calling
on
marriott
and
writing
letters
to
him
about
religion
you
could
say
aunt
charlotte
was
not
religious
but
papa
said
he
would
believe
in
her
religion
if
she
went
to
church
or
farmer
or
propart
they
had
all
got
wives
and
marriott
had
papa
had
forbidden
aunt
charlotte
to
go
any
more
to
marriott
church
marriott
had
written
a
nice
letter
to
uncle
victor
and
uncle
victor
had
taken
papa
to
see
him
and
the
doctor
had
come
to
see
aunt
charlotte
and
she
had
been
sent
to
bed
aunt
charlotte
room
was
at
the
top
of
the
tall
thin
white
house
in
the
high
street
there
was
whispering
on
the
stairs
mamma
and
aunt
lavvy
stood
at
the
turn
you
could
see
their
vexed
faces
aunt
charlotte
called
to
them
to
let
mary
come
to
her
mary
was
told
she
might
go
if
she
were
very
quiet
aunt
charlotte
was
all
by
herself
sitting
up
in
a
large
white
bed
a
bible
propped
itself
open
leaves
downwards
against
the
mound
she
made
there
was
something
startling
about
the
lengths
of
white
curtain
and
the
stretches
of
white
pillow
and
counterpane
and
aunt
charlotte
very
black
eyebrows
and
hair
and
the
cover
of
the
bible
very
black
and
her
blue
eyes
glittering
she
was
writing
letters
every
now
and
then
she
took
up
the
bible
and
picked
out
a
text
and
wrote
it
down
she
wrote
very
fast
and
as
she
finished
each
sheet
she
hid
it
under
the
and
made
a
sign
to
show
that
what
she
was
doing
was
a
secret
love
god
and
you
be
happy
love
god
and
you
be
happy
she
said
her
eyes
pointed
at
you
they
looked
wise
and
solemn
and
excited
a
wide
flat
piece
of
counterpane
was
left
over
from
aunt
charlotte
mary
climbed
up
and
sat
in
it
with
her
back
against
the
and
looked
at
her
looking
at
aunt
charlotte
made
you
think
of
being
born
aunt
charlotte
do
know
what
being
born
is
aunt
charlotte
looked
up
under
her
eyebrows
and
hid
another
sheet
of
paper
what
put
that
in
your
head
all
of
a
sudden
it
because
of
my
babies
catty

think
you
could
aunt
charlotte
said
why
not
catty
say
why
aunt
charlotte
shook
her
head
but
she
was
smiling
and
looking
wiser
and
more
solemn
than
ever
you
must
ask
too
many
questions
she
said
but
you
have
told
me
what
being
born
is
i
know
it
got
something
to
do
with
the
virgin
mary
aunt
charlotte
said
you
must
say
that
nice
little
girls
do
think
about
those
things
her
tilted
eyes
had
turned
down
and
her
mouth
had
stopped
smiling
so
you
knew
that
being
born
was
not
frightening
it
had
something
to
do
with
the
things
you
did
talk
about
and
ye
how
could
it
there
was
the
virgin
mary
aunt
charlotte
do
you
you
had
a
baby
aunt
charlotte
looked
frightened
suddenly
and
began
to
cry
you
must
say
it
mary
you
must
say
it
do
tell
them
you
said
it
they
think
i
been
talking
about
the
babies
the
little
babies
do
tell
them
promise
me
you
wo
tell
ii
aunt
lavvy
i
wish
i
knew
what
you
thought
about
jehovah
when
aunt
lavvy
stayed
with
you
mamma
made
you
promise
not
to
ask
her
about
her
opinions
but
sometimes
you
forgot
aunt
lavvy
looked
more
than
ever
as
if
she
was
by
herself
in
a
quiet
empty
room
thinking
of
something
that
was
there
you
could
help
feeling
that
she
knew
things
mamma
said
she
had
always
been
the
clever
one
just
as
aunt
charlotte
had
always
been
the
queer
one
but
aunt
bella
said
she
was
no
better
than
an
unbeliever
because
she
was
a
unitarian
at
heart
why
jehovah
in
particular
aunt
lavvy
was
like
uncle
victor
she
listened
politely
when
you
talked
to
her
as
if
you
were
saying
something
interesting
because
he
the
one
you
got
to
believe
in
do
you
really
think
he
is
so
very
good
i
do
think
anything
i
do
know
anything
except
that
god
is
love
jehovah
was
jehovah
aunt
lavvy
stopped
herself
i
must
talk
to
you
about
it
because
i
promised
your
mother
i
would
it
was
very
queer
aunt
lavvy
opinions
had
something
to
do
with
religion
yet
mamma
said
you
must
talk
about
them
i
promised
too
i
shall
have
to
confess
and
ask
her
to
forgive
me
then
said
aunt
lavvy
be
sure
you
tell
her
that
i
did
talk
to
you
promise
me
you
tell
her
that
was
what
aunt
charlotte
had
said
talking
about
religion
was
like
talking
about
being
born
xi
i
nobody
has
any
innate
ideas
children
and
savages
and
idiots
have
any
so
people
ca
have
locke
says
but
how
did
he
know
you
might
have
them
and
forget
about
them
and
only
remember
again
after
you
were
grown
up
she
sat
up
in
the
till
nine
now
because
she
was
eleven
years
old
she
had
taken
the
doll
clothes
out
of
the
old
wooden
box
and
filled
it
with
books
the
bible
milton
and
pope
homer
the
greek
accidence
and
and
the
comedies
from
illustrated
shakespeare
in
seven
volumes
which
he
never
read
and
two
volumes
of
and
locke
the
human
she
wished
the
bible
had
been
bound
in
pink
calf
like
pepys
instead
of
the
shiny
black
leather
that
made
you
think
of
wet
goloshes
then
it
would
have
looked
new
and
exciting
like
the
other
books
she
sat
on
a
footstool
with
her
box
beside
her
in
the
corner
behind
mamma
chair
she
had
to
hide
there
because
mamma
did
believe
you
really
liked
reading
she
thought
you
were
only
shamming
and
showing
off
sometimes
and
farmer
would
come
in
and
farmer
would
play
chess
with
papa
while
farmer
talked
to
mamma
about
how
troublesome
and
independent
the
tradespeople
were
and
how
hard
it
was
to
get
servants
and
to
keep
them
mamma
listened
to
farmer
as
if
she
were
saying
something
wonderful
and
exciting
sometimes
it
would
be
the
proparts
or
batty
would
come
in
alone
and
sometimes
they
would
all
come
together
with
the
aunts
and
uncles
and
there
would
be
a
party
mary
always
hoped
that
uncle
victor
would
notice
her
and
say
mary
is
reading
locke
the
human
or
that
propart
would
come
and
turn
over
the
books
and
make
some
interesting
remark
but
they
never
did
at
eight
catty
would
bring
in
the
the
white
and
grey
and
gold
would
be
set
out
round
the
bulging
silver
that
lifted
up
its
spout
with
a
foolish
pompous
expression
like
a
hen
mamma
would
move
about
the
table
in
her
mauve
silk
gown
and
there
would
be
a
scent
of
cream
and
strong
tea
every
now
and
then
the
shimmering
silk
and
the
rich
scent
would
come
between
her
and
the
grey
difficult
page
senses
at
first
let
in
particular
ideas
and
furnish
the
yet
empty
cabinet
and
the
mind
growing
by
degrees
familiar
with
some
of
them
they
are
lodged
in
the
memory
and
names
got
to
them
then
how
then
how
the
thought
she
thought
was
coming
would
come
and
mamma
was
telling
her
to
get
up
and
hand
round
the
bread
and
butter
ii
ponsonby
do
you
remember
your
innate
ideas
my
much
said
ponsonby
the
ideas
you
had
before
you
were
born
ponsonby
said
before
i
was
born
well
he
really
seemed
to
be
considering
it
mamma
chair
pushed
further
along
the
hearthrug
had
driven
her
back
and
back
till
the
box
was
hidden
behind
the
curtain
ponsonby
was
mark
friend
mark
was
at
the
royal
military
academy
at
woolwich
now
every
saturday
ponsonby
came
home
with
mark
and
stayed
till
sunday
evening
you
knew
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
find
you
out
behind
mamma
chair
i
mean
she
said
the
ideas
you
were
born
with
seems
to
me
said
ponsonby
i
was
born
with
precious
few
anyhow
i
ca
say
i
remember
them
i
was
afraid
you
say
that
it
what
locke
says
how
much
locke
you
can
look
at
him
if
you
like
she
thought
he
wo
he
wo
they
never
never
do
but
ponsonby
did
he
looked
at
locke
and
he
looked
at
mary
and
he
said
by
gum
he
even
read
the
bits
about
the
baby
and
the
empty
cabinet
you
do
mean
to
say
you
this
sort
of
thing
i
like
it
most
awfully
of
course
i
do
mean
as
much
as
but
almost
as
much
and
ponsonby
said
well
i
must
say
of
you
by
gum
he
made
it
sound
like
the
most
delicious
praise
ponsonby
was
taller
and
older
than
mark
he
was
nineteen
she
thought
he
was
the
nicest
looking
person
she
had
ever
seen
his
face
was
the
colour
of
thick
white
honey
his
hair
was
very
dark
and
he
had
long
blue
eyes
and
long
black
eyebrows
like
bars
drawn
close
down
on
to
the
blue
his
nose
would
have
been
hooky
if
it
had
been
so
straight
and
his
mouth
was
quiet
and
serious
when
he
talked
to
you
his
mouth
and
eyes
looked
as
if
they
liked
it
mark
came
and
said
minky
if
you
stodge
like
that
you
get
all
flabby
it
was
nice
of
mark
to
say
that
before
ponsonby
when
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
she
could
jump
her
own
height
flabby
feel
my
muscle
it
rose
up
hard
under
her
soft
skin
feel
it
mr
ponsonby
i
say
a
biceps
yes
but
mark
said
you
should
feel
his
his
was
even
bigger
and
harder
than
mark
mine
she
said
sorrowfully
will
never
be
as
good
as
his
then
mamma
came
and
told
her
it
was
and
ponsonby
said
oh
olivier
yet
five
minutes
more
then
but
the
five
minutes
were
never
any
good
you
just
sat
counting
them
and
when
it
was
all
over
and
ponsonby
strode
across
the
and
opened
the
door
for
her
she
went
laughing
she
stood
in
the
doorway
and
laughed
when
you
were
sent
to
bed
at
nine
the
only
dignified
thing
was
to
pretend
you
did
care
and
ponsonby
holding
the
door
so
that
mamma
could
see
him
looked
at
her
and
shook
his
head
as
much
as
to
say
you
and
i
know
it
is
a
joke
for
either
of
us
this
unrighteous
banishment
iii
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
she
might
have
known
that
some
day
mamma
would
come
up
and
find
her
putting
the
children
to
bed
she
had
seven
there
was
isabel
batty
and
farmer
baby
and
mark
in
the
blue
frock
in
the
picture
when
he
was
four
and
dank
in
his
white
frock
and
blue
sash
and
the
three
very
little
babies
you
made
up
out
of
your
head
six
was
their
you
no
business
to
touch
those
mamma
said
the
were
real
every
evening
she
took
them
from
the
drawer
in
the
linen
cupboard
and
when
she
had
sung
the
children
to
sleep
she
shook
out
the
little
frocks
and
petticoats
and
folded
them
in
a
neat
pile
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
i
thought
you
were
in
the
schoolroom
learning
your
lessons
so
i
was
mamma
but
you
know
six
is
their
oh
mary

up
that
silly
game
so
i
did
but
they
wo
let
me
they
do
want
me
to
give
them
up
mamma
sat
down
as
if
it
was
too
much
for
her
i
hope
she
said
you
do
talk
to
catty
or
anybody
about
it
no
mamma
i
could
they
my
secret
that
was
all
very
well
when
you
were
a
little
thing
but
a
great
girl
of
twelve
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
mamma
had
gone
she
had
taken
away
the
mary
lay
face
downwards
on
her
bed
shame
burned
through
her
body
like
fire
hot
tears
scalded
her
eyelids
she
thought
how
was
i
to
know
you
must
have
babies
still
she
could
give
them
all
up
she
keep
isabel
and
the
baby
but
what
would
ponsonby
think
of
her
if
he
knew
iv
ponsonby
ponsonby
stay
where
you
are
and
look
from
the
window
at
the
end
of
the
top
corridor
the
side
of
the
house
went
sheer
down
into
the
lane
mary
was
at
the
window
ponsonby
was
in
the
lane
she
climbed
on
to
the
ledge
and
knelt
there
grasping
the
bottom
of
the
window
frame
firmly
with
both
hands
and
letting
her
knees
slide
from
the
ledge
she
lowered
herself
and
hung
for
one
ecstatic
moment
and
drew
herself
up
again
by
her
arms
what
did
you
do
it
for
mary
ponsonby
had
rushed
up
the
stairs
and
they
were
sitting
there
he
was
so
tall
that
he
hung
over
her
when
he
leaned
it
nothing
you
ought
to
be
able
to
pull
up
your
own
weight
you
must
do
it
from
windows
it
dangerous
not
if
you
practised
on
the
banisters
first
where
mark
with
your
mater
i
say
supposing
you
and
i
go
for
a
walk
we
must
be
back
at
six
she
said
when
you
went
for
walks
with
mark
or
ponsonby
they
always
raced
you
down
ley
street
and
over
the
ford
at
the
bottom
they
both
gave
you
the
same
start
to
the
horn
tavern
the
only
difference
was
that
with
ponsonby
you
were
over
the
ford
first
they
turned
at
the
ford
into
the
field
path
that
led
to
drake
farm
and
the
plantation
he
jumped
all
the
stiles
and
she
vaulted
them
she
could
see
that
he
respected
her
and
so
they
came
to
the
big
water
jump
into
the
plantation
ponsonby
went
over
first
and
held
out
his
arms
she
hurled
herself
forward
and
he
caught
her
and
this
time
instead
of
putting
her
down
instantly
he
lifted
her
up
in
his
arms
and
held
her
tight
and
kissed
her
her
heart
thumped
violently
and
she
had
a
sudden
happy
feeling
neither
spoke
humphrey
propart
had
kissed
her
once
for
a
forfeit
and
she
had
boxed
his
ears
ponsonby
was
a
different
sort
of
kiss
they
tore
through
the
plantation
as
if
nothing
had
happened
clearing
all
the
brooks
in
a
way
ponsonby
took
as
the
serious
and
delightful
thing
it
was
going
home
across
the
fields
they
held
each
other
hands
like
children
minky
he
said
i
do
like
to
think
of
you
hanging
out
of
windows
but
it
so
jolly
to
feel
your
body

squirming
up
after
your
arms

all
the
same

tighter

jimmy
it
was
long
after

she
had
forgotten
the
children

their
after
that
day
she
never
played
with
them
again
if

long
you
ought
to
say
that
mamma
i
of

can
make
the
go
when
you
ca
mamma
smiled
she
knew
it
and
which
would
you
rather
took
you
over
the
crossing
at
the
bank
me
or
papa
mamma
smiled
again
she
knew
she
was
safer
with
mary
at
a
crossing
because
papa
teased
her
and
frightened
her
before
he
dragged
her
over
but
mary
led
her
gently
holding
back
the
noses
of
the
horses
there
that
locke
on
the
human
understanding
said
mamma
poor
jimmy
was
frightened
when
he
found
you
reading
it
he
was
he
was
most
awfully
pleased
and
excited
he
was
laughing
at
you
he
was
he
was
of
course
he
was
laughing
at
you
what
did
you
think
he
was
doing
i
thought
he
was
interested
he
was
then
men
mamma
said
are
interested
in
little
he
told
me
it
was
very
bad
for
you
shame
again
hot
burning
and
scalding
shame
he
was
only
laughing
at
her
mark
does
laugh
at
me
she
said
the
thought
of
mark
and
of
his
love
for
her
healed
her
wound
a
precious
deal
mamma
said
you
know
about
mark
mamma
was
safe
oh
she
was
safe
she
knew
that
mark
loved
her
best
vi
on
the
cover
of
pinnock
catechism
there
was
a
small
black
picture
of
the
parthenon
and
under
it
was
written
abode
of
gods
whose
shrines
no
longer
burn
supposing
the
candles
in
mary
chapel
no
longer
burned
supposing
barkingside
church
and
aldborough
hatch
church
fell
to
bits
and
there
were
no
more
clergymen
and
you
only
read
in
history
books
about
people
like
batty
and
propart
and
their
surplices
and
the
things
they
wore
round
their
necks
supposing
the
christian
religion
passed
away
it
excited
you
to
think
these
things
but
when
you
heard
the
magnificat
in
church
or
when
you
thought
of
christ
hanging
so
bravely
on
the
cross
you
were
sorry
and
you
stopped
thinking
what
a
pity
you
could
ever
go
on
without
having
to
stop
end

adolescence
xii
mary
went
slowly
up
the
lane
between
the
garden
wall
and
the
thorn
hedge
the
air
streaming
towards
her
from
the
flat
fields
had
the
tang
of
cold
glittering
water
the
sweet
grassy
smell
of
the
green
corn
blades
swam
on
it
the
young
thorn
leaves
smelt
of
almonds
and
of
their
own
bitter
green
the
five
trees
stood
up
thin
and
black
in
an
archway
of
golden
white
fire
the
green
of
their
young
leaves
hung
about
them
like
an
emanation
a
skylark
swung
himself
up
a
small
grey
ball
spinning
over
the
tree
tops
to
the
arch
of
the
sunset
his
song
pierced
and
shook
like
the
golden
white
light
with
each
throb
of
his
wings
he
shrank
smaller
and
greyer
a
moth
a
midge
whirling
in
the
luminous
air
a
grey
ball
dropped
spinning
down
by
the
gate
of
the
field
her
sudden
secret
happiness
came
to
her
she
could
never
tell
when
it
was
coming
nor
what
it
would
come
from
it
had
something
to
do
with
the
trees
standing
up
in
the
golden
white
light
it
had
come
before
with
a
certain
sharp
white
light
flooding
the
fields
flooding
the
room
it
had
happened
so
often
that
she
received
it
now
with
a
shock
of
recognition
and
when
it
was
over
she
wanted
it
to
happen
again
she
would
go
back
and
back
to
the
places
where
it
had
come
looking
for
it
thinking
that
any
minute
it
might
happen
again
but
it
never
came
twice
to
the
same
place
in
the
same
way
catty
was
calling
to
her
from
the
bottom
of
the
lane
she
stood
still
by
the
gate
not
heeding
catty
holding
her
happiness
when
she
had
turned
from
the
quiet
fields
it
would
be
gone
ii
sometimes
she
had
queer
glimpses
of
the
persons
that
were
called
mary
olivier
there
was
olivier
only
daughter
proud
of
her
power
over
the
when
she
brought
the
pile
of
hemmed
sheets
to
her
mother
her
heart
swelled
with
joy
in
her
own
goodness
there
was
mark
olivier
sister
who
rejoiced
in
the
movements
of
her
body
the
strain
of
the
taut
muscles
throbbing
on
their
own
leash
the
bound
forwards
the
push
of
the
wind
on
her
knees
and
breast
the
hard
feel
of
the
ground
under
her
padding
feet
and
there
was
mary
olivier
the
little
girl
of
thirteen
whom
her
mother
and
aunt
bella
whispered
about
to
each
other
with
mysterious
references
to
her
age
her
secret
happiness
had
nothing
to
do
with
any
of
these
mary
oliviers
it
was
not
like
any
other
happiness
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
mamma
or
dan
or
roddy
or
even
mark
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
jimmy
she
had
cried
when
jimmy
went
away
and
she
would
cry
again
when
she
thought
about
him
jimmy
going
away
was
worse
than
anything
that
had
happened
yet
or
could
happen
till
mark
went
to
india
that
would
be
the
worst
thing
jimmy
had
not
gone
to
india
as
he
had
said
he
had
had
to
leave
woolwich
because
of
something
he
had
done
and
his
father
had
sent
him
to
australia
he
had
gone
without
saying
and
he
was
never
coming
back
she
would
never
in
all
her
life
see
jimmy
again
jimmy
had
done
something
dreadful
nobody
but
mamma
and
papa
and
mark
knew
what
he
had
done
but
from
the
way
they
talked
you
could
see
that
it
was
one
of
those
things
you
talk
about
only
mark
said
he
did
believe
he
really
had
done
it
last
sunday
she
had
written
a
letter
to
him
which
mark
posted
dear
jimmy
i
think
you
might
have
come
to
say
to
us
even
if
papa
and
mamma
do
think
you
done
something
you
ought
to
i
want
you
to
know
that
mark
and
i
do
believe
you
did
it
and
even
if
you
did
it
wo
make
any
difference
i
shall
always
love
you
just
the
same
next
best
to
mark
you
ca
expect
me
to
love
you
really
best
because
he
will
always
come
first
as
long
as
i
live
i
hope
you
will
be
very
happy
in
australia
i
shall
keep
my
promise
just
the
same
though
australia
and
not
india
you
gone
to
with
love
ever
your
loving
minky
no
i
reading
a
new
poet
byron
there
was
a
silly
woman
who
said
she
rather
have
the
fame
of
childe
harold
than
the
immortality
of
don
juan
but
i
rather
have
the
immortality
would
you
no
do
you
think
that
you
will
keep
kangaroos
they
might
help
to
make
you
happy
iii
mary
was
picking
french
beans
in
the
kitchen
garden
when
mamma
and
aunt
bella
came
along
the
path
talking
together
the
thick
green
walls
of
the
runners
hid
her
mary
is
getting
very
precocious
said
mamma
that
comes
from
being
brought
up
with
boys
said
aunt
bella
she
ought
to
see
more
girls
of
her
own
age
she
does
like
them
mary
shouted
cuckoo
to
warn
them
but
they
would
stop
it
high
time
aunt
bella
said
that
she
should
learn
to
like
them
the
draper
girls
are
too
old
but
there
that
little
bertha
mitchison
i
have
called
on
mitchison
for
two
years
and
why
have
you
caroline
because
i
ca
afford
to
be
always
hiring
wagonettes
to
go
to
woodford
bridge
cuckoo
caroline
do
you
think
she
could
have
heard
cuckoo
aunt
bella
cuckoo
iv
on
the
high
road
the
white
dust
had
a
clear
sharp
exciting
smell
at
the
wet
edges
of
the
ford
it
thickened
when
you
shut
your
eyes
you
could
still
see
bertha
scarlet
frock
on
the
white
bridge
path
and
smell
the
wet
earth
at
the
edges
of
the
ford
you
were
leaning
over
the
white
painted
railing
of
the
bridge
when
she
began
the
water
flowed
from
under
the
little
tunnel
across
the
road
into
the
field
beyond
deep
brown
under
the
tunnel
tawny
in
the
shallow
ford
golden
patches
where
the
pebbles
showed
through
and
the
water
itself
a
sheet
of
thin
crystal
running
over
the
colours
sliding
through
them
running
and
sliding
on
and
on
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
so
beautiful
as
water
unless
it
was
light
but
water
was
another
sort
of
light
bertha
pushed
her
soft
sallow
face
into
yours
her
big
black
eyes
bulged
out
under
her
square
fringe
her
wide
red
mouth
curled
and
glistened
there
were
yellowish
stains
about
the
roots
of
her
black
hair
her
mouth
and
eyes
teased
you
mocked
you
would
let
you
alone
bertha
began
i
know
something
you
do
know
you
listened
you
could
help
listening
you
simply
had
to
know
it
was
no
use
to
say
you
did
believe
a
word
of
it
inside
you
secretly
you
knew
it
was
true
you
were
frightened
you
trembled
and
went
hot
and
cold
by
turns
and
somehow
that
was
how
you
knew
it
was
true
almost
as
if
you
had
known
all
the
time
oh
shut
up
i
do
to
hear
about
it
oh
do
you
you
did
a
minute
ago
of
course
i
did
when
i
did
know
who
would
i
do
want
to
know
any
more
i
like
that
after
i
told
you
everything
what
the
good
of
putting
your
fingers
in
your
ears
there
was
that
day
and
there
was
the
next
day
when
she
was
sick
of
bertha
on
the
third
day
bertha
went
back
to
woodford
bridge
it
was
dreadful
and
at
the
same
time
funny
when
you
thought
of
batty
and
propart
with
their
little
round
hats
and
their
black
coats
and
their
stiff
dignified
faces
and
there
was
uncle
edward
and
his
whiskers
it
could
be
true
yet
all
true
things
came
like
that
with
a
queer
feeling
as
if
you
remembered
them
jenny
wedding
dress
it
would
be
true
even
of
jenny
mamma
had
said
she
would
rather
see
her
in
her
coffin
than
married
to
spall
that
was
why
but
if
it
was
true
of
everybody
it
would
be
true
of
mamma
and
papa
that
was
what
you
hated
knowing
if
only
you
had
gone
on
looking
at
the
water
instead
of
listening
to
bertha
mamma
face
solemn
and
tender
when
you
said
your
prayers
playing
with
the
gold
tassel
of
her
papa
face
on
your
birthday
when
he
gave
you
the
toy
lamb
she
would
like
you
to
know
about
her
mark
would
like
it
mark
her
mind
stood
still
mark
image
stood
still
in
clean
empty
space
when
she
thought
of
her
mother
and
mark
she
hated
bertha
and
there
was
jimmy
that
was
why
they
would
talk
about
him
jimmy
the
big
into
the
plantation
jimmy
arms
the
throb
of
the
hard
muscles
as
he
held
you
jimmy
hand
your
own
hand
lying
in
it
light
and
small
jimmy
eyes
looking
at
you
and
smiling
as
if
they
said
it
all
right
minky
it
all
right
perhaps
when
papa
was
young
mamma
thought
about
him
as
you
thought
about
jimmy
so
that
it
could
be
so
very
dreadful
after
all
xiii
mary
was
glad
when
bertha
went
away
to
school
when
the
new
year
came
and
she
was
fourteen
she
had
almost
forgotten
bertha
she
even
forgot
for
long
stretches
of
time
what
bertha
had
told
her
but
not
altogether
because
if
it
was
true
then
the
story
of
the
virgin
mary
was
not
true
jesus
could
have
been
born
in
the
way
the
new
testament
said
he
was
born
there
was
no
such
thing
as
the
immaculate
conception
you
could
hardly
be
expected
to
believe
in
it
once
you
knew
why
it
could
have
happened
and
if
the
bible
could
deceive
you
about
an
important
thing
like
that
it
could
deceive
you
about
the
incarnation
and
the
atonement
you
were
no
longer
obliged
to
believe
in
that
ugly
business
of
a
cruel
bungling
god
appeased
with
bloodshed
you
were
not
obliged
to
believe
anything
just
because
it
was
in
the
bible
but
if
you
did
you
were
an
infidel
she
could
hear
aunt
bella
talking
to
uncle
edward
and
farmer
and
propart
whispering
mary
is
an
infidel
she
thought
if
i
i
ca
help
it
she
was
even
slightly
elated
as
if
she
had
set
out
on
some
happy
dangerous
adventure
ii
nobody
seemed
to
know
what
pantheism
was
propart
smiled
when
you
asked
him
and
said
it
was
something
you
had
better
not
meddle
with
farmer
said
it
was
only
another
word
for
atheism
you
might
as
well
have
no
god
at
all
as
be
a
pantheist
but
if
pan
meant
all
things
and
theos
was
god
perhaps
it
would
be
in
the
the
encyclopaedia
told
you
all
about
australia
there
was
even
a
good
long
bit
about
byron
too
panceput
panegyric
pantheism
there
you
were
pantheism
is
that
speculative
system
which
by
absolutely
identifying
the
subject
and
object
of
thought
reduces
all
existence
mental
and
material
to
phenomenal
modifications
of
one
eternal
substance
which
is
called
by
the
name
of
god
all
things
are
god
when
you
had
read
the
first
sentence
five
or
six
times
over
and
looked
up
subject
and
object
and
phenomenal
you
could
see
fairly
well
what
it
meant
whatever
else
god
might
be
he
was
not
what
they
said
something
separate
and
outside
things
something
that
made
your
mind
uncomfortable
when
you
tried
to
think
about
it
this
universe
material
and
mental
is
nothing
but
the
spectacle
of
the
thoughts
of
god
you
might
have
known
it
would
be
like
that
the
universe
going
on
inside
god
as
your
thoughts
go
on
inside
you
the
universe
so
close
to
god
that
nothing
could
be
closer
the
meaning
got
plainer
and
plainer
there
was
spinoza
spinning
spinoza
the
encyclopaedia
man
said
that
the
jewish
priests
offered
him
a
bribe
of
two
thousand
florins
to
take
back
what
he
had
said
about
god
and
when
he
refused
to
take
back
a
word
of
it
they
cursed
him
and
drove
him
out
of
their
synagogue
spinoza
said
there
is
no
substance
but
god
nor
can
any
other
be
conceived
and
the
encyclopaedia
man
explained
it
god
as
the
infinite
substance
with
its
infinity
of
attributes
is
the
as
the
infinity
of
modes
under
which
his
attributes
are
manifested
he
is
the
nature
naturing
would
be
the
cause
and
nature
natured
would
be
the
effect
god
was
both
god
is
the
immanent
indwelling
but
not
the
transient
cause
of
all
things
thought
and
extension
are
attributes
of
the
one
absolute
substance
which
is
god
evolving
themselves
in
two
parallel
streams
so
to
speak
of
which
each
separate
body
and
spirit
are
but
the
waves
body
and
soul
are
apparently
two
but
really
one
and
they
have
no
independent
existence
they
are
parts
of
god
were
our
knowledge
of
god
capable
of
present
completeness
we
might
attain
to
perfect
happiness
but
such
is
not
possible
out
of
the
infinity
of
his
attributes
only
two
thought
and
extension
are
accessible
to
us
while
the
modes
of
these
attributes
being
essentially
infinite
escape
our
grasp
so
this
was
the
truth
about
god
in
spite
of
the
queer
words
it
was
very
simple
much
simpler
than
the
trinity
god
was
not
three
incomprehensible
persons
rolled
into
one
not
jesus
not
jehovah
not
the
father
creating
the
world
in
six
days
out
of
nothing
and
muddling
it
and
coming
down
from
heaven
into
it
as
his
own
son
to
make
the
best
of
a
bad
job
he
was
what
you
had
felt
and
thought
him
to
be
as
soon
as
you
could
think
about
him
at
all
the
god
of
baruch
spinoza
was
the
god
you
had
wanted
the
only
sort
of
god
you
cared
to
think
about
thinking
about
him
after
the
christian
god
was
like
coming
out
of
a
small
dark
room
into
an
immense
open
space
filled
with
happy
light
and
yet
as
far
back
as
you
could
remember
there
had
been
a
regular
conspiracy
to
keep
you
from
knowing
the
truth
about
god
even
the
encyclopaedia
man
was
in
it
he
tried
to
put
you
off
pantheism
he
got
into
a
temper
about
it
and
said
it
was
monstrous
and
pernicious
and
profoundly
false
and
that
the
heart
of
man
rose
up
in
revolt
against
it
he
had
begun
by
talking
about
attempts
to
transgress
the
fixed
boundaries
which
one
wiser
than
we
has
assigned
to
our
intellectual
operations
perhaps
he
was
a
clergyman
clergymen
always
put
you
off
like
that
so
that
you
could
help
suspecting
that
they
did
really
know
and
were
afraid
you
would
find
them
out
they
were
like
poor
little
frightened
mamma
when
she
would
let
you
look
at
the
interesting
bits
beyond
the
place
she
had
marked
in
your
french
reader
and
they
were
always
apologising
for
their
god
as
if
they
felt
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
him
and
that
he
was
not
quite
real
but
to
the
pantheists
the
real
god
was
so
intensely
real
that
compared
with
him
being
alive
was
not
quite
real
it
was
more
like
dreaming
another
thing
the
pantheists
the
hindu
ones
and
the
greeks
and
baruch
spinoza
were
heathen
and
the
christians
had
tried
to
make
you
believe
that
the
heathen
went
to
hell
because
they
did
know
the
truth
about
god
you
had
been
told
one
lie
on
the
top
of
another
and
all
the
time
the
truth
was
there
in
the
who
would
have
thought
that
the
encyclopaedia
could
have
been
so
exciting
the
big
books
stood
in
a
long
row
in
the
bottom
shelf
behind
her
father
chair
her
heart
thumped
when
she
gripped
the
volumes
that
contained
the
forbidden
knowledge
of
the
universe
the
rough
morocco
covers
went
as
they
scraped
together
and
there
was
the
sharp
thud
as
they
fell
back
into
their
place
when
she
had
done
with
them
these
sounds
thrilled
her
with
a
secret
joy
when
she
was
away
from
the
books
she
liked
to
think
of
them
standing
there
on
the
hidden
shelf
waiting
for
her
the
pages
of
pantheism
and
spinoza
were
white
and
clean
and
she
had
noticed
how
they
had
stuck
together
nobody
had
opened
them
she
was
the
first
the
only
one
who
knew
and
cared
iii
she
wondered
what
mark
and
her
mother
would
say
when
they
knew
perhaps
mark
would
say
she
ought
not
to
tell
her
mother
if
it
meant
letting
out
that
the
bible
said
things
that
were
not
really
true
his
idea
might
be
that
if
mamma
wanted
to
believe
in
jehovah
and
the
atonement
through
christ
blood
it
would
be
unkind
to
try
and
stop
her
but
who
on
earth
want
to
believe
that
dreadful
sort
of
thing
if
they
could
help
it
papa
might
not
mind
because
as
long
as
he
knew
that
he
and
mamma
would
get
into
heaven
all
right
he
would
worry
so
much
about
other
people
but
mamma
was
always
worrying
about
them
and
making
you
give
up
things
to
them
and
she
must
be
miserable
when
she
thought
of
them
burning
in
hell
for
ever
and
ever
and
when
she
tried
to
reconcile
justice
with
his
mercy
to
say
nothing
of
the
intellectual
discomfort
she
was
living
in
when
you
had
found
out
the
real
happy
truth
about
god
it
did
seem
right
to
keep
it
to
yourself
she
decided
that
she
would
tell
her
mother
mark
was
in
the
royal
field
artillery
now
he
was
away
at
shoeburyness
if
she
put
it
off
till
he
came
home
again
she
might
never
do
it
when
mamma
had
mark
with
her
she
would
never
listen
to
anything
you
had
to
say
next
sunday
was
epiphany
sunday
afternoon
would
be
a
good
time
but
aunt
lavvy
came
to
stay
from
saturday
to
monday
and
it
rained
all
morning
mamma
and
aunt
lavvy
sat
in
the
one
on
each
side
of
the
fireplace
aunt
lavvy
read
james
martineau
after
the
christian
and
mamma
read
the
pulpit
in
the
family
out
of
the
at
somehow
you
could
do
it
with
aunt
lavvy
in
the
room
in
the
afternoon
when
she
went
upstairs
to
lie
down
perhaps
but
in
the
afternoon
mamma
dozed
over
the
at
she
was
so
innocent
and
pretty
nodding
her
head
and
starting
up
suddenly
and
looking
round
with
a
smile
that
betrayed
her
real
opinion
of
sunday
you
could
do
it
while
she
dozed
towards
evening
it
rained
again
and
aunt
lavvy
went
off
to
ilford
for
the
evening
service
by
herself
everybody
else
stayed
at
home
and
there
was
instead
of
church
mary
and
her
mother
were
alone
together
when
her
mother
had
sung
the
last
hymn
lead
kindly
light
then
she
would
do
it
her
mother
was
singing
lover
of
my
soul
let
me
to
thy
bosom
fly
while
the
nearer
roll
while
the
tempest
still
is
high
she
could
see
the
stiff
slender
muscles
straining
in
her
mother
neck
the
weak
plaintive
voice
tore
at
her
heart
she
knew
that
her
voice
was
weak
and
plaintive
its
thin
sweet
notes
unnerved
her
refuge
i
none
hangs
my
helpless
soul
on
thee
helpless
helpless
mamma
was
helpless
it
was
only
her
love
of
mark
and
jesus
that
was
strong
something
would
happen
if
she
told
her
something
awful
she
could
feel
already
the
chill
of
an
intolerable
separation
she
could
give
up
jesus
the
lover
of
her
soul
but
she
could
not
give
up
her
mother
she
could
live
separated
from
mamma
from
the
weak
plaintive
voice
that
tore
at
her
she
could
do
it
iv
catty
eyes
twinkled
through
the
banisters
she
caught
mary
coming
downstairs
and
whispered
that
there
was
cold
boiled
chicken
and
trifle
for
supper
because
of
aunt
lavvy
through
the
door
mary
could
see
her
father
standing
at
the
table
and
the
calm
breasts
of
the
cold
chicken
smoothed
with
white
sauce
and
decorated
with
beetroot
stars
there
was
a
book
beside
papa
plate
the
book
aunt
lavvy
had
been
reading
she
had
left
it
open
on
the
table
when
she
went
to
church
she
was
late
for
supper
and
they
sat
there
waiting
for
her
she
came
in
slowly
as
usual
and
looking
at
the
supper
things
as
though
they
were
not
there
when
she
caught
sight
of
the
book
something
went
up
and
flickered
in
her
eyes
a
sort
of
triumph
you
could
help
thinking
that
she
had
left
it
lying
about
on
purpose
so
that
papa
should
see
it
he
stood
waiting
till
she
had
sat
down
he
handed
the
book
to
her
his
eyes
gleamed
when
you
come
here
he
said
you
will
be
good
enough
to
leave
james
martineau
behind
you
mamma
looked
up
startled
you
do
mean
to
say
you
brought
that
man
books
into
the
house
you
can
see
for
yourself
caroline
said
aunt
lavvy
i
do
want
to
see
no
mary
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
you
mamma
was
smiling
nervously
you
would
have
supposed
that
she
thought
james
martineau
funny
but
the
least
bit
improper
but
look
mamma
it
his
after
the
christian
her
mother
took
up
the
book
and
put
it
down
as
if
it
had
bitten
her
christian
life
indeed
what
right
has
james
martineau
to
call
himself
a
christian
when
he
denies
christ
the
lord
who
bought
him
and
makes
no
secret
of
it
how
can
you
respect
an
infidel
who
uses
christ
name
to
cover
up
his
blasphemy
aunt
lavvy
was
smiling
now
i
thought
you
said
he
made
no
secret
of
it
mamma
said
you
know
very
well
what
i
mean
if
you
knew
martineau
you
no
business
to
know
him
emilius
said
when
your
brother
victor
and
i
disapprove
of
him
emilius
was
carving
chicken
he
had
an
air
of
kindly
luscious
hospitality
hesitating
between
the
two
flawless
breasts
martineau
is
the
wisest
and
holiest
man
i
ever
knew
said
aunt
lavvy
i
daresay
your
sister
charlotte
thinks
marriott
the
wisest
and
the
holiest
man
ever
knew
he
settled
the
larger
breast
on
aunt
lavvy
plate
and
laid
on
it
one
perfect
star
of
beetroot
he
could
do
that
while
he
insulted
her
oh
papa
you
a
br
aunt
lavvy
shook
her
gentle
head
lavinia
dear
mamma
voice
was
gentle
did
you
have
a
nice
service
very
nice
thank
you
did
you
go
to
saint
mary
or
the
parish
church
aunt
lavvy
straight
flat
chin
trembled
slightly
her
pale
eyes
lightened
i
went
to
neither
then
did
you
go
if
you
insist
on
knowing
caroline
i
went
to
robson
church
you
went
to
to
the
unitarian
chapel
to
the
unitarian
chapel
emilius
you
would
have
thought
that
aunt
lavvy
had
hit
mamma
and
hurt
her
emilius
took
up
his
table
napkin
and
wiped
his
moustache
carefully
he
was
quite
horribly
calm
you
will
oblige
me
by
not
going
there
again
he
said
you
forget
that
i
went
every
sunday
when
we
were
in
liverpool
you
forget
that
is
the
reason
why
you
left
liverpool
only
one
of
the
reasons
i
think
can
you
tell
me
what
reason
you
have
for
going
now
beyond
your
desire
to
make
yourself
different
from
other
people
are
unitarians
other
people
she
poured
out
a
glass
of
water
and
drank
she
was
giving
herself
time
my
reason
she
said
is
that
i
have
joined
the
unitarian
church
mamma
put
down
her
knife
and
fork
her
lips
opened
and
her
face
turned
suddenly
sharp
and
sallow
as
if
she
were
going
to
faint
you
do
mean
to
say
you
gone
over
then
god
help
poor
charlotte
emilius
steadied
himself
to
speak
does
victor
know
he
said
yes
he
knows
you
have
consulted
him
and
you
have
not
consulted
me
you
made
me
promise
not
to
talk
about
it
i
have
kept
my
promise
mary
was
sure
then
that
aunt
lavvy
had
left
the
book
open
on
purpose
she
had
laid
a
trap
for
emilius
and
he
had
fallen
into
it
if
you
will
hold
infamous
opinions
you
must
be
made
to
keep
them
to
yourself
i
have
a
perfect
right
to
my
opinions
you
have
no
right
to
make
an
open
profession
of
them
the
law
is
more
tolerant
than
you
emilius
there
is
a
moral
law
and
a
law
of
honour
you
are
not
living
by
yourself
as
long
as
you
are
in
victor
house
the
least
you
can
do
is
to
avoid
giving
offence
have
you
no
consideration
for
your
family
you
say
you
came
here
to
be
near
us
have
you
thought
of
us
have
you
thought
of
the
children
do
you
expect
caroline
to
go
to
victor
house
if
she
to
meet
the
unitarian
minister
and
his
wife
you
will
be
cutting
yourself
off
completely
lavinia
mamma
said
from
what
from
everybody
people
do
call
on
nonconformists
if
there
were
no
higher
grounds
oh
caroline
aunt
lavvy
breathed
it
on
a
long
sigh
it
all
very
well
for
you
but
you
might
think
of
your
sister
charlotte
mamma
said
papa
beard
jerked
he
drew
in
his
breath
with
a
savage
guttural
noise
what
the
good
of
talking
he
had
gone
on
eating
all
the
time
there
was
a
great
pile
of
chicken
bones
on
his
plate
aunt
lavvy
turned
emilius
for
years
her
voice
broke
as
she
quivered
under
her
loaded
anguish
for
years
shouted
me
down
you
have
let
me
call
my
soul
my
own
yet
it
my
own
there
please
mamma
said
do
let
us
have
any
more
of
it
just
as
aunt
lavvy
was
beginning
to
get
a
word
in
edgeways
mamma
that
is
fair
you
must
let
her
speak
yes
you
must
let
me
speak
aunt
lavvy
voice
thickened
in
her
throat
i
wo
have
any
discussion
of
unitarianism
here
said
papa
it
you
who
have
been
discussing
it
not
i
it
is
really
papa
first
you
began
then
mamma
mamma
said
if
you
finished
your
supper
mary
you
can
go
but
i
have
i
not
had
any
trifle
yet
she
thought
they
do
want
me
to
hear
them
but
i
a
right
to
sit
here
and
eat
trifle
they
know
they
ca
turn
me
out
i
have
done
anything
aunt
lavvy
went
on
i
only
one
thing
to
say
emilius
you
asked
me
to
think
of
victor
and
charlotte
and
you
and
caroline
and
the
boys
and
mary
have
you
once
in
years
for
a
single
minute
thought
of
certainly
i
have
it
partly
for
your
own
sake
i
object
to
your
disgracing
yourself
as
if
your
sister
charlotte
was
disgrace
enough
aunt
lavvy
drew
herself
up
stiff
and
straight
in
her
white
shawl
like
a
martyr
in
her
flame
you
might
keep
charlotte
out
of
it
i
think
i
might
charlotte
ca
help
herself

this
point
mamma
burst
into
tears
and
left
the
room
now
he
said
i
hope

satisfied
mary
answered
him
i
think

to
be
papa

lavvy
for
years

you
think
it
about
time
you
stopped
emilius
stared
at
his
daughter
his
face
flushed
slowly
i
think
he
said
it
time
you
went
to
bed
it
is
my
for
another
hour
yet
a
low
murmur
from
aunt
lavvy
do
mary
do
she
went
on
it
was
you
who
made
mamma
cry
not
aunt
lavvy
it
always
frightens
her
when
you
shout
at
people
you
know
aunt
lavvy
a
perfect
saint
besides
being
lots
cleverer
than
anybody
in
this
house
except
mark
you
get
her
by
herself
when
she
tired
out
with
aunt
charlotte
you
insult
her
religion
you
say
the
beastliest
things
you
can
think
of
her
father
pushed
back
his
chair
they
rose
and
looked
at
each
other
you
would
dare
to
do
it
if
mark
was
here
he
strode
to
the
door
and
opened
it
his
arm
made
a
crescent
gesture
that
cleared
space
of
her
go
go
upstairs
go
to
bed
i
do
care
where
i
go
now
i
said
it
upstairs
in
her
bed
she
still
heard
aunt
lavvy
breaking
voice
for
years
for
years
the
scene
rose
again
and
swam
before
her
and
fell
to
pieces
ideas
echoes
images
religion
the
truth
of
god
her
father
voice
booming
over
the
table
aunt
lavvy
voice
breaking
breaking
a
pile
of
stripped
chicken
bones
on
her
father
plate
aunt
lavvy
was
getting
ready
to
go
away
she
held
up
her
night
gown
to
her
chin
smoothing
and
folding
back
the
sleeves
you
thought
of
her
going
to
bed
in
the
ugly
yellow
flannel
night
gown
not
caring
lying
in
bed
and
thinking
about
god
mary
was
sorry
that
aunt
lavvy
was
going
as
long
as
she
was
there
you
felt
that
if
only
she
would
talk
everything
would
at
once
become
more
interesting
she
thrilled
you
with
that
look
of
having
something
something
that
she
would
talk
about
up
her
sleeve
the
encyclopaedia
man
said
that
unitarianism
was
a
kind
of
pantheism
perhaps
that
was
it
perhaps
she
knew
the
truth
about
god
aunt
lavvy
would
know
whether
she
ought
to
tell
her
mother
aunt
lavvy
if
you
loved
somebody
and
you
found
out
that
their
religion
was
true
would
you
tell
them
or
would
you
it
would
depend
on
whether
they
were
happy
in
their
religion
or
not
supposing
you
found
out
one
that
was
more
true
and
much
more
beautiful
and
you
thought
it
would
make
them
happier
aunt
lavvy
raised
her
long
stubborn
chin
in
her
face
there
was
a
cold
exaltation
and
a
sudden
hardness
no
religion
was
ever
more
true
or
more
beautiful
than
christianity
she
said
there
pantheism
are
unitarians
a
kind
of
pantheists
aunt
lavvy
white
face
flushed
unitarians
pantheists
who
been
talking
to
you
about
pantheism
nobody
nobody
knows
about
it
i
had
to
find
out
the
less
you
find
out
about
it
the
better
aunt
lavvy
you
talking
like
propart
supposing
i
honestly
think
pantheism
true
you
no
right
to
think
anything
about
it
aunt
lavvy
said
now
you
talking
like
papa
and
i
did
so
hope
you
would
i
only
meant
that
it
takes
more
time
than
you
lived
to
find
out
what
honest
thinking
when
you
twenty
years
older
you
know
what
this
opinion
of
yours
is
worth
i
know
what
it
worth
to
me
now
this
minute
is
it
worth
making
your
mother
miserable
that
what
mark
would
say
how
did
you
know
i
was
thinking
of
mamma
because
that
what
my
brother
victor
said
to
me
vi
the
queer
thing
was
that
none
of
them
seemed
to
think
the
truth
could
possibly
matter
on
its
own
account
or
that
anything
mattered
besides
being
happy
or
miserable
yet
everybody
except
aunt
lavvy
was
determined
that
everybody
else
should
be
happy
in
their
way
by
believing
what
they
believed
and
when
it
came
to
pantheism
even
aunt
lavvy
could
live
and
let
live
you
could
see
that
deep
down
inside
her
it
made
her
more
furious
than
unitarianism
made
papa
mary
saw
that
she
was
likely
to
be
alone
in
her
adventure
it
appeared
to
her
more
than
ever
as
a
journey
into
a
beautiful
quiet
yet
exciting
country
where
you
could
go
on
and
on
the
mere
pleasure
of
being
able
to
move
enchanted
her
but
nobody
would
go
with
her
nobody
knew
nobody
cared
there
was
spinoza
but
spinoza
had
been
dead
for
ages
now
she
came
to
think
of
it
she
had
never
heard
anybody
not
even
propart
speak
of
spinoza
it
would
be
worse
for
her
than
it
had
ever
been
for
aunt
lavvy
who
had
actually
known
martineau
martineau
was
not
dead
and
if
he
had
been
there
were
still
lots
of
unitarian
ministers
alive
all
over
england
and
in
the
end
aunt
lavvy
had
broken
loose
and
gone
into
her
unitarian
chapel
she
thought
not
till
after
grandmamma
was
dead
till
years
after
grandmamma
was
dead
she
thought
of
course
i
die
rather
than
tell
mamma
vii
aunt
lavvy
had
gone
parish
had
taken
her
away
in
his
wagonette
at
lessons
mamma
complained
that
you
were
not
attending
but
she
was
not
attending
herself
and
when
sewing
time
came
she
showed
what
she
had
been
thinking
about
what
were
you
doing
in
aunt
lavvy
room
this
morning
she
looked
up
sharply
over
the
socks
piled
before
her
for
darning
only
talking
was
aunt
lavvy
talking
to
you
about
her
opinions
no
mamma
has
she
ever
talked
to
you
of
course
not
she
would
if
she
promised
not
to
i
do
know
even
now
what
unitarianism
is
what
unitarians
believe
in
goodness
knows
her
mother
said
nothing
that
any
good
to
them
you
may
be
sure
mary
went
on
darning
the
coarse
wool
of
the
socks
irritated
her
fingers
it
caught
in
a
split
nail
setting
her
teeth
on
edge
if
you
went
on
darning
for
ever
if
you
went
on
darning
mamma
would
be
pleased
she
had
not
suspected
anything
viii
fathom
five
thy
father
lies
of
his
bones
are
coral
made
those
are
pearls
that
were
his
eyes
nothing
of
him
that
doth
fade
but
doth
suffer
a
into
something
rich
and
strange
between
the
lovely
lines
she
could
hear
mamma
say
they
all
scamp
their
work
you
would
require
a
resident
carpenter
and
a
resident
glazier
and
farmer
soft
drawl
spinning
out
the
theme
and
a
resident
plumber
yes
olivier
you
really
and
farmer
had
called
and
stayed
to
tea
across
the
room
you
could
see
his
close
hatchet
nose
and
straggly
beard
every
now
and
then
his
small
greenish
eyes
lifted
and
looked
at
you
impossible
that
you
had
ever
enjoyed
going
to
farmer
to
see
the
baby
it
was
like
something
that
had
happened
to
somebody
else
a
long
time
ago
farmer
was
always
having
babies
and
always
asking
you
to
go
and
see
them
she
could
understand
that
as
you
grew
older
you
left
off
caring
about
we
are
such
stuff
as
dreams
are
made
of
the
bishop
confirmation
opportunity
even
mamma
owned
that
farmer
never
knew
when
it
was
time
to
go
dreams
are
made
of
and
our
little
life
is
rounded
with
a
sleep
the
universe
is
nothing
but
the
spectacle
of
the
dreams
of
god
or
was
it
the
thoughts
of
god
confirmation
parish
church
bishop
confirmation
she
had
seen
a
confirmation
once
years
ago
girls
in
white
dresses
and
long
white
veils
like
brides
shining
behind
the
square
black
windows
of
the
broughams
dora
and
effie
draper
effie
leaned
forward
her
pretty
piercing
face
looked
out
through
the
black
pane
not
seeing
anything
trying
greedily
to
be
seen
big
boys
and
girls
knelt
down
in
rows
before
the
bishop
and
his
sleeves
went
flapping
up
and
down
over
them
like
bolsters
in
the
wind
farmer
was
looking
at
her
again
as
if
he
had
an
idea
in
his
head
ix
the
church
service
was
open
at
the
articles
mamma
had
pushed
smith
history
of
england
away
do
you
think
she
said
you
could
say
the
catechism
and
the
athanasian
creed
straight
through
without
stopping
i
daresay
i
could
if
i
tried
why
because
farmer
will
want
to
examine
you
whatever
for
because
her
mother
said
there
going
to
be
a
confirmation
time
you
were
thinking
about
being
confirmed
confirmed
and
why
not
you
well
i
have
got
to
be
have
i
you
will
have
sooner
or
later
so
you
may
as
well
begin
to
think
about
it
now
confirmation
she
had
never
thought
about
it
as
a
real
thing
that
might
happen
to
her
that
would
happen
sooner
or
later
if
she
did
do
something
to
stop
farmer
and
mamma
i
thinking
i
thinking
tight
tight
tight
her
mind
in
agony
pinned
itself
to
one
point
how
she
could
stop
her
mother
without
telling
her
beyond
that
point
she
could
see
clearly
you
see
you
see
i
do
to
be
confirmed
you
do
want
you
might
as
well
say
you
did
want
to
be
a
christian
do
worry
mamma
darling
i
only
want
to
stay
as
i
am
i
must
worry
i
responsible
for
you
as
long
as
you
not
confirmed
you
forget
that
i
your
godmother
as
well
as
your
mother
she
had
forgotten
it
and
papa
and
uncle
victor
were
her
godfathers
what
did
your
godfathers
and
godmothers
then
for
you
they
did
promise
and
vow
three
things
in
my
name
they
had
actually
done
it
first
that
i
should
renounce
renounce
renounce
secondly
that
i
should
believe
all
the
articles
of
the
christian
faith
the
christian
faith
the
catholic
faith
which
faith
except
everyone
do
keep
whole
and
undefiled
without
doubt
he
shall
perish
everlastingly
and
the
catholic
faith
is
this
that
we
worship
one
god
in
trinity
and
trinity
in
unity
they
had
promised
and
vowed
all
that
in
her
name
what
right
had
they
what
right
had
they
you
not
a
baby
any
more
her
mother
said
that
what
i
mean
i
was
a
baby
when
you
went
and
did
it
i
knew
nothing
about
it
you
make
me
responsible
it
we
who
are
responsible
her
mother
said
i
mean
for
your
vows
and
promises
mamma
darling
if
you
let
me
off
my
responsibility
i
let
you
off
yours
now
her
mother
said
you
prevaricating
that
means
you
never
let
me
off
if
i
do
do
it
now
i
have
to
do
it
next
year
or
the
next
you
may
feel
more
seriously
about
it
next
year
or
next
week
her
mother
said
meanwhile
you
learn
the
articles
read
them
through
first
of
original
or
original
sin
is
the
fault
and
corruption
of
the
nature
of
every
man
whereby
man
is
far
gone
from
original
righteousness
and
is
of
his
own
nature
inclined
to
evil
so
that
the
flesh
lusteth
always
contrary
to
the
spirit
and
therefore
in
every
person
born
into
this
world
it
deserveth
god
wrath
and
damnation
do
look
like
that
her
mother
said
as
if
your
wits
were
wool
she
could
see
herself
smiling
at
her
mother
disagreeably
gathering
wool
the
room
was
full
of
wool
wool
flying
about
hanging
in
the
air
and
choking
you
clogging
your
mind
old
grey
wool
out
of
pew
cushions
that
people
had
sat
on
for
centuries
full
of
dirt
wool
spun
out
wound
round
you
woven
in
a
net
you
were
tangled
and
strangled
in
a
net
of
unclean
wool
they
caught
you
in
it
when
you
were
a
baby
a
month
old
mamma
papa
and
uncle
victor
you
would
have
to
cut
and
tug
and
kick
and
fight
your
way
out
they
were
caught
in
it
themselves
they
could
get
out
they
did
want
to
get
out
the
wool
stopped
their
minds
working
they
hated
it
when
their
minds
worked
when
anybody
mind
worked
aunt
lavvy
yours
of
works
before
justification
works
done
before
the
grace
of
christ
and
the
inspiration
of
his
spirit
are
not
pleasant
to
god
forasmuch
as
they
spring
not
of
faith
in
jesus
christ
yea
rather
for
that
they
are
not
done
as
god
hath
willed
and
commanded
them
to
be
done
we
doubt
not
but
they
have
the
nature
of
sin
do
you
really
believe
that
mamma
of
course
i
believe
it
all
our
righteousness
is
filthy
rags
people
goodness
people
kindness
the
sweet
beautiful
things
they
did
for
each
other
the
brave
noble
things
the
things
mark
did
filthy
rags
this
religion
of
theirs
was
filthy
ugly
like
the
shiny
black
covers
of
their
bibles
where
their
fingers
left
a
grey
greasy
smear
filthy
and
frightful
like
funerals
you
might
as
well
be
buried
alive
five
coffins
deep
in
a
pit
of
yellow
clay
mamma
could
really
believe
it
you
would
have
to
tell
her
it
true
not
telling
her
meant
that
you
did
think
she
cared
about
the
truth
you
insulted
her
if
you
supposed
she
did
care
mark
would
say
you
insulted
her
even
if
it
hurt
her
a
bit
at
first
you
insulted
her
if
you
thought
she
could
bear
it
and
afterwards
she
would
be
happy
because
she
would
be
free
it
no
use
mamma
i
sha
ever
want
to
be
confirmed
want
want
want
you
ought
to
want
then
you
say
you
believe
the
christian
faith
now
now
a
clean
quick
cut
no
jagged
ends
hanging
that
it
i
do
believe
a
single
word
of
it
she
could
look
at
her
mother
she
did
want
to
see
her
cry
you
found
that
out
have
you
you
been
mighty
quick
about
it
i
found
it
out
ages
ago
but
i
did
mean
to
tell
you
her
mother
was
not
crying
you
need
tell
me
now
she
said
you
do
suppose
i
going
to
believe
it
not
crying
smiling
a
sort
of
cunning
and
triumphant
smile
you
just
want
an
excuse
for
not
learning
those
articles
xiv
mamma

crying
papa

long

then
they
could
forget
it
they
could
be
glad
that
mark
should
have
all
those
things
so
many
more
and
more
beautiful
than
he
had
ever
had
they
were
appeased
with
their
labour
of
forming
over
and
over
again
the
letters
clear
and
perfect
of
his
name

out
of
the
house
i
suppose
you
thought
that
with
mark
going
you
better
make
a
clean
sweep
it
be
roddy
next
i
did
turn
him
out
of
the
house
but
it
was
about
time
he
went
the
young
cub
temper
is
getting
unbearable
i
daresay
you
ruined
dan
temper
with
your
silly
tease
tease
tease
from
morning
till
night
you
ca
see
a
dog
without
wanting
to
make
it
snap
and
snarl
it
was
the
same
with
all
the
children
and
when
they
turned
you
bullied
them
just
because
you
could
break
mark
spirit
you
tried
to
crush
dan
it
a
wonder
he
has
any
temper
left
emilius
stroked
his
beard
that
right
stroke
your
beard
as
if
nothing
mattered
but
your
pleasure
you
be
happy
enough
when
mark
gone
emilius
left
off
stroking
his
beard
you
say
i
turned
him
out
of
the
office
he
said
did
he
stay
with
edward
nobody
could
stay
with
edward
you
could
yourself
ask
victor
how
long
he
thinks
he
keep
him
what
do
you
mean
emilius
he
did
answer
he
stood
there
his
lips
pouting
between
his
moustache
and
beard
his
eyes
smiling
wickedly
as
if
he
had
just
found
out
he
could
torment
her
more
by
not
saying
what
he
meant
if
dan
went
to
the
bad
she
said
i
would
blame
him
it
would
serve
you
right
unless
she
added
that
what
you
want
and
she
began
to
cry
she
cried
as
a
child
cries
with
spasms
of
sobbing
her
pretty
mouth
spoiled
stretched
wide
working
like
dull
red
blotches
creeping
up
to
the
brown
stains
about
her
eyes
her
tears
splashed
on
to
the
fine
black
silk
web
of
the
sock
and
sparkled
there
emilius
had
gone
from
the
room
leaving
the
door
open
mary
got
up
and
shut
it
she
stood
hesitating
the
helpless
sobbing
drew
her
frightened
her
stirred
her
to
exasperation
that
was
helpless
too
her
mother
had
never
been
more
intolerably
dear
she
went
to
her
she
put
her
arm
round
her
do
mamma
darling
why
do
you
let
him
torture
you
he
did
turn
dan
out
of
the
office
he
let
him
go
because
he
ca
afford
to
pay
him
enough
i
know
that
as
well
as
you
her
mother
said
surprisingly
she
drew
herself
from
the
protecting
arm
well
then
but
oh
what
a
brute
he
is
a
brute
for
shame
to
talk
that
way
of
your
father
no
right
you
the
one
that
always
goes
and
beginning
to
cry
again
she
rose
and
went
out
grasping
mark
sock
in
her
convulsive
hand
mary
did
you
hear
your
mother
say
i
bullied
you
her
father
had
come
back
into
the
room
yes
she
said
have
i
ever
bullied
you
she
looked
at
him
steadily
no
you
would
have
done
if
mamma
had
loved
me
as
much
as
she
loves
mark
i
wish
you
had
i
wish
you
bullied
the
life
out
of
me
i
should
have
cared
i
wish
you
hated
me
then
i
should
have
known
she
loved
me
he
looked
at
her
in
silence
with
round
startled
eyes
he
understood
ii
ubique
the
gunner
motto
mark
motto
stamped
on
all
the
letters
he
would
write
a
blue
gun
on
a
blue
the
muzzle
pointing
to
the
left
the
motto
waving
underneath
ubique
at
soldiers
funerals
the
coffin
was
carried
on
a
and
covered
with
a
flag
quo
fas
et
gloria
all
through
the
excitement
of
the
evening
it
went
on
sounding
in
her
head
it
was
mark
coming
of
age
party
in
the
week
before
he
went
the
first
time
she
could
remember
being
important
at
a
party
her
consciousness
of
being
important
was
intense
exquisite
she
was
mark
olivier
sister
his
only
one
and
besides
she
looked
nice
last
year
white
muslin
ironed
out
looked
as
good
as
new
the
blue
sash
really
was
new
and
mamma
had
lent
her
one
of
her
necklets
a
turquoise
heart
on
a
thin
gold
chain
in
the
she
could
see
her
eyes
shining
under
her
square
brown
fringe
spots
of
gold
darting
through
brown
crystal
her
brown
hair
shone
red
on
the
top
and
gold
underneath
the
side
pieces
rolled
above
her
ears
and
plaited
behind
made
a
fillet
for
her
back
hair
her
back
hair
was
too
short
she
tried
to
make
it
reach
to
her
waist
by
pulling
the
curled
tips
straight
but
they
only
sprang
back
to
her
again
it
was
unfortunate
catty
securing
the
wonderful
fillet
with
a
blue
ribbon
told
her
not
to
be
unhappy
she
would
do
mamma
was
beautiful
in
her
silk
and
her
black
jet
cross
with
the
diamond
star
they
all
had
to
stand
together
a
little
behind
her
near
the
door
and
shake
hands
with
the
people
as
they
came
in
mary
was
surprised
that
they
should
shake
hands
with
her
before
they
shook
hands
with
mark
it
did
seem
right
somehow
when
it
was
his
birthday
everybody
had
come
except
aunt
charlotte
even
marriott
though
he
was
supposed
to
be
afraid
of
parties
you
could
ask
aunt
charlotte
because
of
mr
marriott
there
were
the
two
manistys
looking
taller
and
leaner
than
ever
and
there
was
draper
with
dora
and
effie
draper
black
hawk
eyes
in
purple
rings
white
powder
over
crushed
carmines
a
black
wing
of
hair
folded
over
grey
down
effie
pretty
piercing
face
small
head
poised
to
strike
dora
a
young
likeness
of
draper
an
old
likeness
of
effie
pretty
when
effie
was
there
when
they
looked
at
you
you
saw
that
your
muslin
was
not
as
good
as
new
when
they
looked
at
mamma
you
saw
that
her
lavender
silk
was
and
that
nobody
wore
black
jet
crosses
now
you
were
frilly
and
floppy
when
everybody
else
was
tight
and
straight
in
princess
dresses
mamma
was
more
beautiful
than
draper
and
her
hair
anyhow
was
in
the
fashion
parted
at
the
side
a
soft
brown
wing
folded
over
her
left
ear
but
that
made
her
look
small
and
pathetic
a
wounded
bird
she
ought
not
to
have
been
made
to
look
like
that
you
could
hear
dora
and
effie
being
kind
to
mamma
dear
olivier
indulgence
condescension
as
if
to
an
unfortunate
and
rather
foolish
person
mark
could
see
that
he
was
smiling
a
hard
angry
smile
draper
was
mamma
dearest
friend
they
could
sit
and
talk
to
each
other
about
nothing
for
hours
together
in
the
holidays
draper
used
to
be
always
coming
over
to
talk
to
mamma
always
bringing
dora
and
effie
with
her
always
asking
mark
and
dan
and
roddy
to
her
house
always
wondering
why
mark
never
went
dan
went
dan
seemed
as
if
he
could
keep
away
this
year
draper
had
left
off
asking
mark
and
dan
and
roddy
she
had
left
off
bringing
dora
and
effie
with
her
mary
wondered
why
she
had
brought
them
now
and
why
her
mother
had
asked
them
the
manistys
she
had
brought
them
for
the
manistys
she
wanted
mamma
to
see
what
she
had
brought
them
for
and
mamma
had
asked
them
because
she
did
care
and
wanted
them
to
see
that
she
did
care
and
that
mark
did
care
either
if
they
only
knew
how
mark
detested
them
with
their
olivier
something
was
going
on
she
heard
uncle
victor
saying
to
aunt
lavvy
mark
party
is
a
bit
rough
on
dan
dan
was
trying
to
get
to
effie
through
a
gap
in
the
group
formed
by
the
manistys
and
two
young
subalterns
mark
friends
each
time
he
did
it
draper
stopped
him
by
moving
somehow
so
as
to
fill
the
gap
he
gave
it
up
at
last
to
sit
by
himself
at
the
bottom
of
the
room
jammed
into
a
corner
between
the
and
the
rosewood
cabinet
where
he
stared
at
effie
with
hot
unhappy
eyes
supper
mamma
was
worried
about
the
supper
she
would
have
liked
to
have
given
them
a
nicer
one
but
there
was
enough
money
besides
she
was
afraid
of
what
uncle
victor
would
think
if
they
were
extravagant
that
was
the
worst
of
borrowing
mark
said
you
could
spend
so
much
afterwards
still
there
was
enough
wine
yet
in
the
cellar
for
fifty
parties
you
could
see
now
some
advantage
in
papa
habit
of
never
drinking
any
but
the
best
wine
and
laying
in
a
large
stock
of
it
while
he
could
mary
noticed
that
papa
and
dan
drank
the
most
perhaps
dan
drank
more
than
papa
the
smell
of
wine
was
over
all
the
supper
spoiling
it
sending
through
her
nerves
a
reminiscent
shiver
of
disgust
mark
brought
her
back
into
the
for
the
ice
she
had
had
dan
was
there
by
himself
sitting
in
the
place
effie
had
just
left
effie
glass
had
still
some
wine
in
it
you
could
see
him
look
for
the
wet
side
of
the
rim
and
suck
the
drops
that
had
touched
her
mouth
something
small
and
white
was
on
the
floor
beside
him
he
stooped
for
it
you
could
hear
him
breathing
up
the
scent
on
it
with
big
sighing
sobs
they
slunk
back
into
the
mark
asked
her
to
play
something
make
a
noise
minky
perhaps
they
go
the
hungarian
march
she
could
play
it
better
than
mamma
mamma
never
could
see
that
the
bass
might
be
even
more
important
than
the
treble
she
was
glad
that
she
could
play
it
better
than
mamma
and
she
hated
herself
for
being
glad
mark
stood
by
the
piano
and
looked
at
her
as
she
played
they
talked
under
cover
of
the
droom

mamma
passed
and
looked
at
them
her
face
shrank
and
sharpened
under
the
dropped
wing
of
her
hair
she
must
have
heard
what
mark
said
she
hated
it
when
mark
talked
and
looked
like
that
she
hated
it
when
you
played
music
beethoven
then
the
sonata
eroica
was
bound
up
with
violetta
the
guards
and
mabel
waltzes
and
the
pluie

that
was
the
meaning
of
the
noble
serious
passionate
music

break
off
to
look
round
dan

come
back
into
the
room
to
his
place
between
the
cabinet
and
the
he
stooped
forward
his
head
hanging
as
if
some
weight
dragged
it
his
eyes
turned
up
staring
at
effie

half
circles
of
white
his
face
was
flushed

queer
leaden
grey
flush
aunt

beside

slantwise
as

went
on

standing
up

for
the
ledge
of
the
cabinet
then
he
started
to
come
down
the
room
his
head
lowered
thrust
forward
his
eyes
heavy
with
some
earnest
sombre
purpose
he
seemed
to
be

by
himself

in

middle
of
the

on
to

a
separate
hurrying
pace

towards
mark
last
night
she
had
left
her
door
open
so
that
she
could
hear
him
come
upstairs
he
came
and
sat
on
her
bed
as
he
used
to
do
years

to
hold
her
still
tighter
in
his
arms
what
nothing
he
said
only
no
lingering
and
no
words
mark
feet
quick
in
the
passage
a
door
shut
to
a
short
crushing
embrace
before
he
turned
from
her
to
her
mother
her
mother
and
she
alone
together
in
the
emptied
room
turning
from
each
other
without
a
word
the
wallflowers
had
grown
up
under
the
south
side
of
the
garden
wall
a
hedge
of
and
saffron
they
gave
out
a
hot
velvet
smell
like
roses
and
violets
laced
with
mignonette
mamma
stood
looking
at
the
wallflowers
smiling
at
them
happy
as
if
mark
had
never
gone
as
if
mark
had
never
gone

mamma
whispered
to
draper
and
aunt
bella
whispered
to
mamma
fourteen
they
always
made
a
mystery
about
being
fourteen
they
ought
to
have
told
her
her
thoughts
about
her
mother
went
up
and
down
mamma
was
not
helpless
she
was
not
gentle
she
was
not
really
like
a
wounded
bird
she
was
powerful
and
rather
cruel
you
could
only
appease
her
with
piles
of
hemmed
sheets
and
darned
stockings
if
you
did
take
care
she
would
get
hold
of
you
and
never
rest
till
she
had
broken
you
or
turned
and
twisted
you
to
her
own
will
she
would
say
it
was
god
will
she
would
think
it
was
god
will
they
might
at
least
have
told
you
about
the
pain
the
knives
of
pain
you
had
to
clench
your
fists
till
the
fingernails
bit
into
the
palms
over
the
ear
of
the
sofa
cushions
she
could
feel
her
hot
eyes
looking
at
her
mother
with
resentment
she
thought
you
had
no
business
to
have
me
you
had
no
business
to
have
me
somebody
else
eyes
somebody
else
thoughts
not
yours
not
yours
mamma
got
up
and
leaned
over
you
and
covered
you
with
the
rug
her
white
face
quivered
above
you
in
the
dusk
her
mouth
pushed
out
to
yours
making
a
small
sound
like
a
moan
you
heard
yourself
cry
mamma
mamma
you
are
adorable
that
was
you
ii
and
as
if
mark
had
never
gone
as
if
that
awful
thing
had
never
happened
to
dan
as
if
she
had
never
had
those
thoughts
about
her
mother
her
hidden
happiness
came
back
to
her
unhappiness
only
pushed
it
to
a
longer
rhythm
nothing
could
take
it
away
anything
might
bring
it
the
smell
of
the
white
dust
on
the
road
the
wind
when
it
came
up
out
of
nowhere
and
brushed
the
young
wheat
blades
beat
the
green
flats
into
slopes
where
the
white
light
rippled
and
ran
like
water
set
the
green
field
shaking
and
tossing
like
a
green
sea
the
five
elm
trees
stiff
ecstatic
dancers
holding
out
the
pattern
of
their
skirts
haunting
rhymes
sudden
cadences
the
grave
sounding
through
the
beethoven
sonata
its
thrill
of
reminiscence
passed
into
the
thrill
of
premonition
of
something
about
to
happen
to
her
xvi
i
poems
made
of
the
white
dust
of
the
wind
in
the
green
corn
of
the
five
trees
they
would
be
the
most
beautiful
poems
in
the
world
sometimes
the
images
of
these
things
would
begin
to
move
before
her
with
persistence
as
if
they
were
going
to
make
a
pattern
she
could
hear
a
thin
a
moving
white
pattern
of
sound
that
when
she
tried
to
catch
it
broke
up
and
flowed
away
the
image
pattern
and
the
sound
pattern
belonged
to
each
other
but
when
she
tried
to
bring
them
together
they
fell
apart
that
came
of
reading
too
much
byron
how
was
it
that
patterns
of
sound
had
power
to
haunt
and
excite
you
like
the
potnia
potnia
nux
that
she
found
in
the
discarded
longfellow
stuck
before
his
voices
of
the
night
potnia
potnia

hypnodoteira

she
wished
she
knew
greek
the
patterns
the
sounds
made
were
so
hard
and
still
and
there
were
bits
of
patterns
snapt
off
throbbing
wounds
of
sound
that
could
heal
lines
out
of
mark
homer
mark
greek
books
had
been
taken
from
her
five
years
ago
when
rodney
went
to
chelmsted
and
they
had
come
back
with
rodney
this
easter
they
stood
on
the
shelf
in
mark
bedroom
above
his
one
day
she
found
her
mother
there
dusting
and
arranging
the
books
besides
the
little
shabby
oxford
homers
there
were
an
aeschylus
a
sophocles
two
volumes
of
aristophanes
clean
and
new
three
volumes
of
euripides
and
a
greek
testament
on
the
table
a
greek
anthology
bound
in
green
with
the
owner
name
ponsonby
stamped
on
it
in
gilt
letters
she
remembered
jimmy
giving
it
to
mark
she
took
the
from
its
place
and
turned
over
the
torn
discoloured
pages
her
mother
looked
up
annoyed
and
uneasy
like
a
child
disturbed
in
the
possession
of
its
toys
mark
books
are
to
be
kept
where
mark
put
them
she
said
but
mamma
i
want
them
never
in
her
life
had
she
wanted
anything
so
much
as
those
books
when
will
you
learn
not
to
want
what
is
yours
mark
does
want
them
or
he
have
taken
them
he
give
them
me
if
he
was
here
he
is
here
i
wo
have
them
touched
till
he
comes
back
but
mamma
darling
i
may
be
dead
i
had
to
wait
five
years
as
it
is
wait
what
for
i
should
like
to
know
to
learn
greek
of
course
her
mother
face
shivered
with
repugnance
it
was
incredible
that
anybody
should
hate
a
poor
dead
language
so
just
because
mark
learnt
greek
you
think
must
try
i
thought
you
grown
out
of
all
that
tiresome
affectation
it
was
funny
when
you
were
a
little
thing
but
it
is
funny
now
her
mother
sat
down
to
show
how
tired
she
was
of
it
it
just
silly
vanity
mary
heart
made
a
queer
and
startling
movement
as
if
it
turned
over
and
dashed
itself
against
her
ribs
there
was
a
sudden
swelling
and
aching
in
her
throat
her
head
swam
slightly
the
room
mark
room
with
mark
white
bed
in
one
corner
and
dan
white
bed
in
the
other
had
changed
it
looked
like
a
room
she
had
never
been
in
before
she
had
never
seen
that
mahogany
washstand
and
the
greyish
blue
flowers
on
the
jug
and
basin
the
person
sitting
on
the
bedroom
chair
was
a
stranger
who
wore
unaccountably
a
brown
dress
and
a
gold
with
a
gold
tassel
that
she
remembered
she
had
an
odd
feeling
that
this
person
had
no
right
to
wear
her
mother
dress
and
her
chain
the
flash
of
queerness
was
accompanied
by
a
sense
of
irreparable
disaster
everything
had
changed
she
heard
herself
speaking
speaking
steadily
with
the
voice
of
a
changed
and
unfamiliar
person
mark
does
think
it
vanity
you
only
think
it
is
because
you
want
to
the
mind
of
this
unfamiliar
self
had
a
remorseless
lucidity
that
seemed
to
her
more
shocking
than
anything
she
could
imagine
it
went
on
as
if
urged
by
some
supreme
necessity
you
afraid
afraid
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
mother
really
was
afraid
afraid
and
what
of
her
mother
said
the
flash
went
out
leaving
her
mind
dark
suddenly
and
defeated
i
do
know
what
i
only
know
you
afraid
that
an
awful
thing
for
any
child
to
say
to
any
mother
just
because
i
wo
let
you
have
your
own
way
in
everything
until
your
will
is
resigned
to
god
will
i
may
well
be
afraid
how
do
you
know
god
does
want
me
to
know
greek
he
may
want
it
as
much
as
i
do
and
if
you
did
know
it
what
good
would
it
do
you
she
stood
staring
at
her
mother
not
answering
she
knew
the
sound
patterns
were
beautiful
and
that
was
all
she
knew
beauty
beauty
could
be
hurt
and
frightened
away
from
you
if
she
talked
about
it
now
she
would
expose
it
to
outrage
though
she
knew
that
she
must
appear
to
her
mother
to
be
stubborn
and
stupid
even
sinful
she
put
her
stubbornness
her
stupidity
her
sinfulness
between
it
and
her
mother
to
defend
it
i
ca
tell
you
she
said
no
i
do
suppose
you
can
her
mother
followed
up
the
advantage
given
her
you
just
go
about
dreaming
and
mooning
as
if
there
was
nothing
else
in
the
wide
world
for
you
to
do
i
ca
think
what
come
over
you
you
used
to
be
content
to
sit
still
and
sew
by
the
hour
together
you
were
more
help
to
me
when
you
were
ten
than
you
are
now
the
other
day
when
i
asked
you
to
darn
a
hole
in
your
own
stocking
you
looked
as
if
i
told
you
to
go
to
your
funeral
it
time
you
began
to
take
an
interest
in
looking
after
the
house
there
enough
to
keep
you
busy
most
of
your
time
if
you
only
did
the
half
of
it
is
that
what
you
want
me
to
be
mamma
a
servant
like
catty
poor
catty
if
you
were
more
like
catty
her
mother
said
you
be
happier
than
you
are
now
i
can
tell
you
catty
is
never
disagreeable
or
disobedient
or
discontented
no
but
perhaps
catty
mother
thinks
she
is
she
thought
she
afraid
do
you
suppose
her
mother
said
it
any
pleasure
to
me
to
find
fault
with
my
only
daughter
if
you
were
my
only
daughter
perhaps
i
should
find
fault
her
new
self
answered
again
implacable
in
its
lucidity
you
mean
if
you
had
a
girl
you
could
do
what
you
liked
with
you
have
let
me
alone
you
have
let
me
alone
if
you
could
have
done
what
you
liked
with
mark
she
noticed
as
if
it
had
a
separate
and
significant
existence
her
mother
hand
lying
on
the
green
cover
of
the
greek
anthology
if
you
were

if
you
were

i
only
were

never
hurt
me

never
gave
me

you
always

you
always

some
day
you
be
sorry
for
it
she
was
sorry
for
it
now
miserable
utterly
beaten
her
new
self
seemed
to
her
a
devil
that
possessed
her
she
hated
it
she
hated
the
books
she
hated
everything
that
separated
her
and
made
her
different
from
her
mother
and
from
mark
her
mother
went
past
her
to
the
door
mamma
i
did
mean
it
mamma
before
she
could
reach

it
shut
between
them
ii
the
library
at
five
elms
was
very
small
emilius
used
it
as
a
but
it
was
lined
with
books
where
the
rows
of
shelves
met
the
shutter
cases
a
fold
of
overlapped
their
ends
on
the
fifth
shelf
covered
by
the
curtain
she
found
the
four
volumes
of
shelley
in
and
black
leather
she
had
passed
them
scores
of
times
in
her
hunt
for
something
to
read
percy
bysshe
shelley
percy
bysshe
what
a
silly
name
she
had
thought
of
him
as
she
thought
of
allison
of
in
seventeen
volumes
and
the
poems
of
cornwall
and
leigh
hunt
books
you
read
if
you
were
on
a
desert
island
there
was
something
about
shelley
in
byron
and
something
she
had
read
and
forgotten
that
persisted
struggled
to
make
itself
remembered
shelley
pantheism
the
pages
of
shelley
were
very
clean
they
stuck
together
lightly
at
the
edges
like
the
pages
of
the
encyclopaedia
at
pantheism
and
spinoza
whatever
their
secret
was
you
would
have
to
find
it
for
yourself
table
of
contents
poems
written
in
hymn
to
intellectual
beauty
she
read
that
first
sudden
thy
shadow
fell
on
me
i
shrieked
and
clasped
my
hands
in
ecstasy
it
had
happened
to
shelley
too
he
knew
how
you
felt
when
it
happened
only
you
did
shriek
it
was
a
real
thing
then
that
did
happen
to
people
she
read
the
ode
to
a
skylark
the
ode
to
the
west
wind
and
adonais
all
her
secret
happiness
was
there
shelley
knew
about
the
queerness
of
the
sharp
white
light
and
the
sudden
stillness
when
the
grey
of
the
fields
turns
to
violet
the
clear
hard
stillness
that
covers
the
excited
of
the
light
life
like
a
dome
of
glass
stains
the
white
radiance
of
eternity
colours
were
more
beautiful
than
white
radiance
but
that
was
because
of
the
light
the
more
light
there
was
in
them
the
more
beautiful
they
were
it
was
their
real
life
one
afternoon
propart
called
he
came
into
the
library
to
borrow
a
book
and
what
are
so
deep
in
he
said
shelley
shelley
shelley
he
looked
at
her
a
kind
considering
look
she
liked
his
grey
face
with
its
tired
keenness
she
thought
he
was
going
to
say
something
interesting
about
shelley
but
he
only
smiled
his
thin
drooping
smile
and
presently
he
went
away
with
his
book
next
morning
the
shelleys
were
not
in
their
place
behind
the
curtain
somebody
had
moved
them
to
the
top
shelf
catty
brought
the
in
the
evening
they
were
gone
propart
must
have
borrowed
them
iii
to
this
then
comes
our
whole
argument
respecting
the
fourth
kind
of
madness
on
account
of
which
anyone
who
on
seeing
the
beauty
in
this
lower
world
being
reminded
of
the
true
begins
to
recover
his
wings
and
having
recovered
them
longs
to
soar
aloft
but
being
unable
to
do
it
looks
upwards
like
a
bird
and
despising
things
below
is
deemed
to
be
affected
with
madness
beauty
in
itself
in
itself
beauty
in
beautiful
things
she
had
never
thought
about
it
that
way
before
it
would
be
like
the
white
light
in
the
colours

discovered
in
looking
for

there
too
xvii
i
the
french
nephew
was
listening
he
had
been
listening
for
quite
a
long
time
ten
minutes
perhaps
ever
since
they
had
turned
off
the
railway
bridge
into
ley
street
they
had
known
each
other
for
exactly
four
hours
and
seventeen
minutes
she
had
gone
to
the
drapers
for
tea
rodney
had
left
her
on
their
doorstep
and
he
had
found
her
there
and
had
brought
her
into
the
that
he
declared
was
at
five
and
it
was
now
seventeen
minutes
past
nine
by
his
watch
which
he
showed
her
it
had
begun
at
when
he
listened
he
turned
round
excitedly
in
his
chair
he
stooped
bringing
his
eyes
level
with
yours
when
he
talked
he
tossed
back
his
head
and
stuck
out
his
chin
she
was
not
sure
that
she
liked
his
eyes
hot
black
smoky
blurs
like
breath
on
glass
old
tired
eyelids
or
his
funny
sallowish
face
narrowing
to
the
black
ugly
one
minute
nice
the
next
it
moved
too
much
he
could
say
all
sorts
of
things
with
it
and
with
his
shoulders
and
his
hands
draper
said
that
was
because
he
was
half
french
he
was
showing
her
how
french
verse
should
be
read
when
rodney
came
for
her
and
draper
sent
rodney
away
and
kept
her
for
dinner
the
french
nephew
was
taking
her
home
now
they
had
passed
the
crook
of
the
road
and
all
this
time
she
said
i
do
know
your
name
maurice
maurice
jourdain
i
know
yours
mary
olivier
i
like
it
you
would
if
you
were
me
and
your
father
kept
on
saying
mary
quite
contrary
and
had
a
little
lamb
fathers
will
do
these
cruel
things
it
a
way
they
have
papa
is
cruel
only
he
so
awfully
fond
of
mamma
that
he
ca
think
about
he
does
mind
me
so
much
oh
he
does
mind
you
so
much
no
it
mark
he
ca
stand
who
is
mark
my
brother
mark
is
a
soldier
royal
artillery
lucky
mark
i
was
to
have
been
a
soldier
why
were
you
my
mother
would
have
liked
it
so
i
had
to
give
it
up
how
you
must
have
loved
her
mark
loves
my
mother
more
than
anything
but
he
could
have
done
that
perhaps
mark
has
got
to
provide
for
his
mother
and
his
sisters
i
had
and
i
had
to
go
into
a
disgusting
business
to
do
it
he
was
beautiful
inside
he
did
beautiful
things
she
was
charmed
suddenly
by
his
inner
his
immaterial
beauty
she
thought
he
must
be
ever
so
old
but
it
made
them
love
you
awfully
has
it
she
said
his
shoulders
and
eyebrows
lifted
he
made
a
queer
movement
with
his
hands
palms
outwards
he
stood
still
in
the
path
turned
to
her
straight
and
tall
he
looked
down
at
her
his
lips
jerked
the
hard
sharp
smile
bared
narrow
teeth
the
more
you
do
for
people
the
less
they
love
you
he
said
your
people
must
be
very
funny
no
no
they
simply
pious
orthodox
christians
and
i
do
believe
in
christianity
i
an
atheist
i
do
believe
their
god
exists
i
hope
he
does
they
would
mind
so
much
if
i
were
a
villain
too
but
it
awkward
for
them
when
they
find
an
infidel
practising
any
of
the
christian
virtues
my
eldest
sister
ruth
would
tell
you
that
i
a
villain
she
does
really
think
it
does
she
my
dear
child
she
got
to
think
it
or
give
up
her
belief
she
could
see
the
gable
end
of
five
elms
now
it
would
soon
be
over
when
they
got
to
the
garden
gate
it
over
i
suppose
he
said
i
must
shut
the
prison
door
they
looked
at
each
other
through
the
bars
and
laughed
when
shall
i
see
you
again
he
said
ii
she
had
seen
him
again
she
could
count
the
times
on
the
fingers
of
one
hand
once
when
he
came
to
dinner
with
and
draper
once
at
sunday
supper
with
the
drapers
after
church
once
on
a
saturday
when
draper
asked
her
to
tea
again
and
once
when
he
called
to
take
her
for
a
walk
in
the
fields
mamma
had
lifted
her
eyebrows
and
draper
said
nonsense
he
old
enough
to
be
her
father
the
green
corn
stood
above
her
ankles
then
this
was
the
fifth
time
the
corn
rose
to
her
waist
the
ears
were
whitening
you
the
only
person
besides
mark
who
listens
there
was
jimmy
but
that
was
different
he
did
know
things
he

darling
but

things
who
is
jimmy
mark
friend
and
mine
is
he
in
australia
he
ca
ever
come
back
so
i
shall
never
see
him
again
i
glad
to
hear
it
a
sudden
dreadful
doubt
she
turned
to
him
in
the
narrow
path
you
are
laughing
at
me
are
you
you
do
think
i
shamming
and
showing
off
i
i
laughing
at
you
my
poor
child
no
they
do
understand
that
you
can
really
love
words
beautiful
sounds
and
thoughts
love
them
awfully
as
if
they
were
alive
as
if
they
were
people
they
are
alive
they
better
than
people
you
know
the
best
of
your
shelley
and
plato
and
spinoza
instead
of
the
worst
i
should
have
liked
to
have
known
them
too
sometimes
i
pretend
that
i
do
know
them
that
they
alive
that
they
here
saying
things
and
listening
they
kind
they
never
misunderstand
they
never
lose
their
tempers
you
must
do
that
he
said
sharply
why
not
it
is
good
for
you
talk
to
me
i
alive
i
here
i
listen
i
never
misunderstand
i
never
lose
my
temper
you
are
always
here
he
smiled
secretly
with
straight
lips
under
the
funny
frizzy
french
moustache
and
when
he
spoke
again
he
looked
old
and
wise
like
an
uncle
wait
he
said
wait
a
bit
wait
three
years
three
years
she
said
three
years
before
we
can
go
for
another
walk
he
shouted
laughter
and
drew
it
back
with
a
groan
she
could
tell
him
that
she
pretended
he
was
there
when
he
was
not
there
that
she
created
situations
he
was
ill
and
she
nursed
him
she
could
feel
the
weight
of
his
head
against
her
arm
and
his
forehead
hot
hot
under
her
hand
she
had
felt
her
hands
to
see
whether
they
would
be
nice
enough
to
put
on
jourdain
forehead
they
were
rather
nice
cool
and
smooth
the
palms
brushed
together
with
a
soft
swishing
sound
like
fine
silk
he
was
poor
and
she
worked
for
him
he
was
in
danger
and
she
saved
him
from
a
runaway
horse
from
a
furious
dog
from
a
burning
house
from
a
lunatic
with
a
revolver
it
made
her
sad
to
think
how
unlikely
it
was
that
any
of
these
things
would
ever
happen
iii
jourdain
i
am
going
to

shut
up
with

tight
in
the
narrow

of

papa
sitting
slantways
nearly
filled
the
cab
he
was
quiet
and
sad
almost
as
if
he
were
sorry
she
was
going
his
sadness
and
quietness
fascinated
her
he
had
a
mysterious
wonderful
secret
life
going
on
in
him
funny
you
should
think
of
it
for
the
first
time
in
the
cab
supposing
you
stroked
his
hand
better
not
he
like
it
not
forty

there
was
no

only
the
maison

road
and
the
big
square
house
in
the
walled
garden
brown
wire
blinds
half
way
up
the
schoolroom
windows
an
old
lady
with
grey
hair
and
a
kind
blunt
face
like
jenny
she
unpacked
your
box
in
the
large
light
bedroom
folding
and
unfolding
your
things
with
little
gentle
tender
hands
miss

she
hoped
you
would
be
happy
with
them
hoped
you
would
mind
sleeping
alone
the
first
night
thought
you
must
be
hungry
and
took
you
down
to
tea
in
the
long
more
girls
pretending
not
to
look
at
you
talking
politely
to
miss
lambert
after
tea
they
paired
off
glad
to

each

she
sat
in
the
corner
of
the
schoolroom
reading
the

roddy
had
given
her
two

more

night
a
strange
white
bed
two
empty
beds
strange
and
white
in
the
large
light
room
she
wondered
what
sort
of
girls
would
be
sleeping
there
night
a
big
white
curtain
you
could
draw
it
across
the
room
and
shut
them
out
she
lay
awake
thinking
of
her
mother
crying
now
and
then
thinking
of
roddy
and
dan
mysterious
measured
sounds
came
through
the
open
window
that
was
the
sea
she
got
up
and
looked
out

garden
lay
under
the
window
black
and
clear
like
a
well

over
there
and
paris
jourdain
had
written
to
say
he
was
going
to

she
had
his
letter
in
bed
she
felt
for
the
sharp
edge
of
the
envelope
sticking
out
under
the
pillow
she
threw
back
the
hot
blankets
the
wind
flowed
to
her
running
cold
like
water
over
the
thin
sheet
a
light
moved
across
the
ceiling
somebody
had
waked
her
somebody
was
putting
the
blankets
back
again
pressing
a
large
kind
hand
to
her

that

in
the
blessed
trinity
and
all
the

truths
of

it
over

sorry

like
it
if

told
you

you
that
why

told

you
amused
yourself
by
seeing
how
near
you
could
get
to
what
you
would
have
heard
if

dreadful
to

worth
it

rose
face
stirred
a
doubt
doubt
of
the
miracle
she
carried
her
books
to
the
white
curtained
room
where
miss
haynes
knelt
by
her
trunk
packing
her
clothes
with
little
gentle
tender
hands
miss
haynes
suddenly
i
not
expelled
am
i
expelled
my
dear
child
who
talking
about
expulsion
as
if
she
said
when
miracles
are
worked
for
you
accept
them
she
lay
awake
thinking
what
she
should
say
to
her
mother
when
she
got
home
she
would
have
to
tell
her
that
just
at
first
she
very
nearly
expelled
then
her
mother
would
believe
in
her
unbelief
and
not
think
she
was
shamming
and
she
would
have
to
explain
about
her
unbelief
and
about
pantheism
vii
she
wondered
how
she
would
set
about
it
it
would
do
to
start
suddenly
by
saying
you
did
believe
in
jesus
or
the
god
of
the
old
testament
or
hell
that
would
hurt
her
horribly
the
only
decent
thing
would
be
to
let
her
see
how
beautiful
spinoza
god
was
and
leave
it
to
her
to
make
the
comparison
you
would
have
to
make
it
quite
clear
to
yourself
first
it
was
like
this
there
were
the
five
elm
trees
and
there
was
the
happy
white
light
on
the
fields
god
was
the
trees
he
was
the
happy
light
and
he
was
your
happiness
there
was
catty
singing
in
the
kitchen
god
was
catty
oh
and
there
was
papa
and
papa
temper
god
would
have
to
be
papa
too
spinoza
could
have
meant
it
that
way
he
meant
that
though
god
was
all
papa
papa
was
not
all
god
he
was
only
a
bit
of
him
he
meant
that
if
god
was
the
only
reality
papa
would
be
quite
real
but
if
papa
was
quite
real
then
mamma
and
mark
were
not
quite
real
either
if
spinoza
had
meant
that
but
perhaps
he
had
perhaps
he
meant
that
parts
of
papa
the
parts
you
saw
most
of
his
beard
for
instance
and
his
temper
were
not
quite
real
but
that
some
other
part
of
him
the
part
you
could
see
might
be
real
in
the
same
way
that
god
was
that
would
be
papa
himself
and
it
would
be
god
too
and
if
god
could
be
papa
he
would
have
no
difficulty
at
all
in
being
mamma
and
mark
surely
mamma
would
see
that
if
you
had
to
have
a
god
spinoza
was
by
far
the
nicest
god
besides
being
the
easiest
to
believe
in
surely
it
would
please
her
to
think
like
that
about
papa
to
know
that
his
temper
was
not
quite
real
and
that
your
sin
when
you
sinned
was
not
quite
real
so
that
not
even
your
sin
could
separate
you
from
god
all
your
life
mamma
had
dinned
into
you
the
agony
of
separation
from
god
and
the
necessity
of
the
atonement
she
would
feel
much
more
comfortable
if
she
knew
that
there
never
had
been
any
separation
and
that
there
need
be
any
atonement
of
course
she
might
not
like
the
idea
of
sin
being
somehow
inside
god
she
might
say
it
looked
bad
but
if
it
was
inside
god
it
would
have
to
be
outside
him
supporting
itself
and
causing
itself
and
then
where
were
you
you
would
have
to
say
that
god
was
not
the
cause
of
all
things
and
that
would
be
much
worse
surely
if
you
put
it
to
her
like
that
but
somehow
she
could
hear
herself
saying
all
that
to
her
mother
supposing
mamma
would
listen
and
she
could
hear
herself
talking
about
her
happiness
the
sudden
secret
happiness
that
more
than
anything
was
like
god
when
she
thought
of
it
she
was
hot
and
cold
by
turns
and
she
had
no
words
for
it
she
remembered
the
first
time
it
had
come
to
her
and
how
she
had
found
her
mother
in
the
and
had
knelt
down
at
her
knees
and
kissed
her
hands
with
the
idea
of
drawing
her
into
her
happiness
and
she
remembered
her
mother
face
it
made
her
ashamed
even
now
as
if
she
had
been
silly
she
thought
i
shall
never
be
able
to
talk
about
it
to
mamma
yet
perhaps
now
that
the
miracle
had
happened
viii
in
the
morning
miss
lambert
took
her
up
to
london
she
had
a
sort
of
idea
that
the
kind
lady
talked
to
her
a
great
deal
about
god
and
the
christian
religion
but
she
could
listen
she
could
talk
she
could
think
now
for
three
hours
in
the
train
in
the
at
victoria
while
miss
lambert
talked
to
papa
outside
in
the
cab
alone
with
papa
miss
lambert
must
have
said
something
nice
about
her
for
he
looked
pleased
as
if
he
would
mind
if
you
did
stroke
his
hand
in
wagonette
she
sat
happy
and
still
contemplating
the
shining
lovely
miracle
ix
she
saw
catty
open
the
front
door
and
run
away
her
mother
was
coming
slowly
down
the
narrow
hall
she
ran
up
the
flagged
path
mamma
she
flung
herself
to
the
embrace
her
mother
swerved
from
her
staggering
back
and
putting
out
her
hands
between
them
aware
of
parish
shouldering
the
trunk
she
turned
into
the
open
mary
followed
her
and
shut
the
door
her
mother
sat
down
helplessly
mary
saw
that
she
was
crying
she
had
been
crying
a
long
time
her
soaked
eyelashes
were
parted
by
her
tears
and
gathered
into
points
mamma
what
is
it
what
is
it
you
disgraced
yourself
everlastingly
you
disgraced
your
father
and
you
disgraced
me
that
what
it
is
i
have
done
anything
of
the
sort
mamma
you
do
think
it
a
disgrace
then
to
be
expelled
for
infidelity
but
i
not
expelled
you
are
expelled
and
you
know
it
no
they
said
i
was
they
did
want
me
to
go
they
told
me
you
wanted
me
back
again
is
it
likely
i
should
want
you
when
you
had
been
gone
three
weeks
she
could
hear
herself
gasp
see
herself
standing
there
idiotic
nothing
could
shake
her
mother
in
her
belief
that
she
had
been
expelled
of
course
if
it
makes
you
happier
to
believe
it
she
said
at
last
do
will
you
let
me
see
miss
lambert
letter
no
her
mother
said
i
will
not
suddenly
she
felt
hard
and
strong
in
her
sad
wisdom
her
mother
did
love
her
she
never
had
loved
her
nothing
she
could
ever
do
would
make
her
love
her
miracles
did
happen
she
thought
i
wonder
why
she
wo
let
me
see
miss
lambert
letter
she
went
upstairs
to
her
room
she
leaned
on
the
sill
of
the
open
window
looking
out
drinking
in
the
sweet
air
of
the
autumn
fields
the
five
elms
raised
golden
heads
to
a
blue
sky
her
childhood
had
died
with
a
little
gasp
catty
came
in
to
unpack
her
box
catty
with
wet
cheeks
kissed
a
dead
child
xix
i
in
the
train
from
bristol
to
paddington
for
the
last
time
july
she
would
never
see
any
of
them
again
ada
and
geraldine
mabel
and
florrie
and
little
lena
and
kate
miss
wray
with
her
pale
face
and
angry
eyes
never
hear
her
sudden
cold
delicious
praise
never
see
the
bare
oblong
schoolroom
with
the
brown
desks
seven
rows
across
for
the
lower
school
one
long
form
along
the
wall
for
class
one
where
she
and
ada
and
geraldine
sat
apart
never
look
through
the
bay
windows
over
the
lea
to
the
channel
at
sunset
lundy
island
flattened
out
floating
gold
on
gold
in
the
offing
never
see
magenta
valerian
growing
in
hot
white
grey
walls
never
hear
louie
prichard
straining
the
little
music
room
with
polonaise
never
breathe
in
its
with
the
of
the
pathetic
sonata
she
was
glad
she
had
seen
it
through
to
the
end
when
the
clergymen
and
squires
daughters
went
and
the
daughters
of
bristol
drapers
and
publicans
and
keepers
came
what
do
you
think
bessie
parson
brother
marked
all
her
underclothing
in
the
shop
but
they
taught
you
quite
a
lot
of
things
zoology
physiology
evidences
british
law
political
economy
it
had
been
a
wonderful
school
when
propart
nieces
went
to
it
and
they
kept
all
that
up
when
the
smash
came
and
the
butter
gave
out
and
you
ate
cheap
bread
that
tasted
of
alum
and
potatoes
that
were
fibrous
skeletons
in
a
green
pulp
oh
she
had
seen
it
through
a
whole
year
and
a
half
of
it
why
because
you
promised
mamma
you
stick
to
the
clevehead
school
whatever
it
was
like
because
they
taught
you
german
and
let
you
learn
greek
by
yourself
with
the
old
arithmetic
master
ada
clark
said
it
was
a
mean
trick
to
get
more
marks
because
of
the
beethoven
and
schumann
and
chopin
and
lundy
island
and
the
valerian
because
nothing
mattered
not
even
going
hungry
she
was
glad
she
had
told
about
that
nor
why
she
asked
for
the
room
to
herself
that
turned
out
to
be
a
servants
garret
on
a
deserted
floor
you
could
wake
at
five
in
the
light
mornings
and
read
plato
or
snatch
twenty
minutes
from
undressing
before
miss
payne
came
for
your
candle
the
tall
sycamore
swayed
in
the
moonlight
tapping
on
the
window
pane
its
shadow
moved
softly
in
the
room
like
a
ghost
ii
she
would
like
to
see
the
valerian
again
though
mamma
said
it
grow
in
yorkshire
funny
to
be
going
back
to
ilford
after
roddy
and
papa
and
mamma
had
left
it
funny
to
be
staying
at
five
elms
with
uncle
victor
nice
uncle
victor
buying
the
house
from
papa
and
making
dan
live
with
them
that
was
to
keep
him
from
drinking
uncle
victor
was
hurt
because
papa
and
mamma
would
go
to
morfe
when
he
wanted
you
all
to
live
with
him
but
you
could
imagine
emilius
and
victor
living
together
or
mamma
and
aunt
lavvy
bristol
to
paddington
this
time
next
week
it
would
be
king
cross
to
reyburn
for
morfe
she
wondered
what
it
would
be
like
aunt
bella
said
it
was
a
place
morfe
morfe
it
did
sound
rather
as
if
people
died
in
it
aunt
bella
was
angry
with
waugh
and
miss
frewin
for
making
mamma
go
there
but
aunt
bella
had
never
liked
waugh
and
miss
frewin
that
was
because
they
had
been
mamma
friends
at
school
and
not
aunt
bella
she
wondered
what
they
would
be
like
and
whether
they
would
disapprove
of
her
they
would
if
they
believed
she
had
been
expelled
from
dover
and
had
broken
mamma
heart
all
mamma
friends
thought
that
she
did
mind
going
to
morfe
so
much
the
awful
thing
was
leaving
ilford
ilford
was
part
of
mark
part
of
her
part
of
her
and
mark
together
there
were
things
they
had
done
that
never
in
all
their
lives
they
could
do
again
waldteufel
waltzes
played
on
the
old
cramer
piano
standing
in
its
place
by
the
door
waltzes
that
would
never
sound
the
same
in
any
other
place
in
any
other
room
and
there
was
the
sumach
tree
it
would
die
if
you
transplanted
it
iii
the
little
thin
sallow
old
man
coming
towards
her
on
the
platform
at
paddington
turned
out
to
be
uncle
victor
she
had
not
seen
him
since
christmas
for
at
easter
he
had
been
away
somewhere
on
business
he
came
slowly
showing
a
smile
of
jerked
muscles
under
cold
fixed
eyes
he
was
not
really
glad
to
see
her
that
was
because
he
disapproved
of
her
they
all
believed
she
had
been
expelled
from
the
dover
school
and
they
did
seem
able
to
forget
it
going
down
from
liverpool
street
to
ilford
he
sat
bowed
and
dejected
in
his
corner
not
looking
at
her
unless
he
could
help
it
how
aunt
charlotte
she
thought
he
would
be
pleased
to
think
that
she
had
remembered
aunt
charlotte
but
he
winced
as
if
she
had
hit
him
she
is
not
so
well
and
then
how
have
you
been
getting
on
oh
all
right
i
got
the
literature
prize
again
and
the
french
prize
and
the
german
prize
and
i
might
have
got
the
good
conduct
prize
too
and
why
did
you
get
it
because
i
gave
it
up
somebody
else
had
to
have
a
prize
and
miss
wray
said
she
knew
it
was
the
one
i
could
best
bear
to
part
with
uncle
victor
frowned
as
if
he
were
displeased
you
do
seem
to
consider
that
i
gave
it
up
she
said
but
he
had
turned
his
eyes
away
he
was
listening
any
more
as
he
used
to
listen
the
train
was
passing
the
city
of
london
cemetery
she
thought
i
must
go
and
see
jenny
grave
before
i
leave
i
wish
i
had
teased
her
so
to
love
me
she
thought
if
i
die
i
shall
be
put
in
the
grass
plot
beside
grandpapa
and
grandmamma
olivier
papa
will
bring
me
in
a
coffin
all
the
way
from
morfe
in
the
train
little
birch
bushes
were
beginning
to
grow
among
the
graves
she
wondered
how
she
could
ever
have
been
afraid
of
those
graves
and
of
their
dead
uncle
victor
was
looking
at
the
graves
too
queerly
with
a
sombre
passionate
interest
when
the
train
had
passed
them
he
sighed
and
shut
his
eyes
as
if
he
wanted
to
keep
on
seeing
them
to
keep
on
as
parish
wagonette
drove
up
ley
street
he
pointed
to
a
field
where
a
street
of
little
houses
had
begun
some
day
they
run
a
street
over
five
elms
but
i
sha
know
anything
about
it
he
said
no
it
wo
be
for
ages
he
smiled
queerly
they
drew
up
at
the
gate
you
must
be
prepared
for
more
changes
he
said
aunt
lavvy
was
at
the
gate
she
was
sweet
as
if
she
loved
you
and
sad
as
if
she
still
remembered
your
disgrace
no
not
that
door
she
said
the
and
had
changed
places
and
both
were
filled
with
the
large
mahogany
furniture
that
had
belonged
to
grandpapa
why
you
turned
it
back
to
front
strips
of
mamma
garden
shone
between
the
dull
maroon
red
curtains
inside
the
happy
light
was
dead
there
seemed
to
her
something
sinister
about
this
change
only
the
two
spare
rooms
still
looked
to
the
front
they
had
put
her
in
one
of
them
instead
of
her
old
room
on
the
top
floor
dan
had
the
other
instead
of
his
it
was
very
queer
aunt
lavvy
sat
in
mamma
place
at
the
head
of
the
a
tall
woman
in
an
gown
stood
at
her
elbow
holding
a
little
tray
she
looked
curiously
at
mary
as
if
her
appearance
there
surprised
and
interested
her
aunt
lavvy
put
a
cup
of
tea
on
the
tray
where
aunt
charlotte
aunt
charlotte
is
upstairs
she
is
very
well
the
maid
was
saying
miss
charlotte
asked
for
a
large
piece
of
plum
cake
and
aunt
lavvy
added
a
large
piece
of
plum
cake
to
the
plate
of
thin
bread
and
butter
mary
thought
there
ca
be
much
the
matter
with
her
if
she
can
eat
all
that
can
i
see
her
she
said
she
heard
the
woman
whisper
better
not
she
was
glad
when
she
left
the
room
has
old
louisa
gone
then
no
aunt
lavvy
said
she
added
presently
that
is
aunt
maid
iv
aunt
charlotte
looked
out
through
the
bars
of
the
old
nursery
window
she
nodded
to
mary
and
called
to
her
to
come
up
aunt
lavvy
said
it
did
her
good
to
see
people
there
was
a
door
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
in
a
matchboard
partition
that
walled
the
well
of
the
staircase
you
rang
a
bell
the
corridor
was
very
dark
another
partition
with
a
door
in
it
shut
off
the
rooms
and
the
back
staircase
they
had
put
the
big
yellow
linen
cupboard
before
the
tall
window
the
one
she
used
to
hang
out
of
some
of
the
old
things
had
been
left
in
the
nursery
schoolroom
so
that
it
looked
much
the
same
britton
the
maid
sat
in
jenny
low
chair
by
the
fireguard
aunt
charlotte
sat
in
an
armchair
by
the
window
her
face
was
thin
and
small

woke
up
suddenly
it
was
her
third
night
in
the
spare
room
at
five
elms
she
had
dreamed
that
she
saw
aunt
charlotte
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
basement
stairs
by
the
cat
cupboard
where
the
kittens
were
born
taking
her
clothes
off
and
hiding
them
she
had
seen
that
before
when
she
was
six
years
old
she
did
know
whether
she
had
been
dreaming
about
something
that
had
really
happened
or
about
a
dream
only
this
time
she
saw
aunt
charlotte
open
her
mouth
and
scream
the
scream
woke
her
she
remembered
her
mother
and
aunt
bertha
in
the
talking
their
faces
together
that
was
a
dream
there
was
a
sound
of
feet
overhead
uncle
victor
room
a
sound
of
a
door
opening
and
shutting
and
then
a
scream
muffled
by
the
shut
door
her
heart
checked
turned
sickeningly
she
had
dreamed
that
uncle
victor
shouted
down
the
stair
to
dan
she
could
hear
dan
feet
in
the
next
room
and
his
door
opening
the
screaming
began
again
up
and
up
tearing
your
brain
then
tearing
your
heart
out
and
short
and
sharp
she
threw
off
the
and
went
out
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
the
cries
had
stopped
there
was
a
sound
of
feet
staggering
and
shuffling
somebody
being
carried
dan
came
back
down
the
stair
his
trousers
were
drawn
up
over
his
the
braces
hanging
he
was
sucking
the
back
of
his
hand
and
spitting
the
blood
out
on
to
his
sleeve
dan
was
that
aunt
charlotte
yes
was
it
pain
no
he
was
out
of
breath

with
the
beating
of
his
heart

your
hand

all
right

went
back
presently
she
heard
him
leave
his
room
and
go
upstairs
again
the
bolt
of
the
front
door
squeaked
then
the
hinge
of
the
gate
somebody
going
out
she
fell
asleep
the
sound
of
hoofs
and
wheels
woke
her
the
room
was
light
she
got
up
and
went
to
the
open
window
draper
black
brougham
stood
at
the
gate
the
sun
blazed
on
the
flat
mangold
field
across
the
road
the
green
leaves
had
the
cold
glitter
of
wet
pointed
metal
to
the
a
dead
smear
of
dawn
the
brougham
did
look
like
itself
standing
still
in
that
unearthly
light
as
if
it
were
taking
part
in
a
funeral
the
funeral
of
some
dreadful
death
she
put
on
her
and
waited
looking

to
look
downstairs

up
by
her
half
leading
half
pushing
her
before
them
her
feet
made
a
brushing
noise
on
the
flagstones
they
lifted
her
into
the
brougham
and
placed
themselves
one
on
each
side
of
her
then
britton

the
scent
of
hay
came
through
the
open
window
of
her
room
clearer
and
finer
than
the
hay
smell
of
the
essex
fields
she
shut
her
eyes
to
live
purely
in
that
one
sweet
sense
and
opened
them
to
look
at
the
hill
the
great
hill
heaved
up
against
the
east
you
had
to
lean
far
out
of
the
window
to
see
it
all
it
came
on
from
the
hidden
north
its
top
straight
as
a
wall
against
the
sky
then
the
long
shoulder
falling
and
falling
then
the
thick
trees
a
further
hill
cut
the
trees
off
from
the
sky
roddy
was
saying
something
sprawling
out
from
the
corner
of
the
he
stared
with
sulky
unseeing
eyes
into
the
little
room
roddy
what
did
you
say
that
hill
was
greffington
edge
you
are
listening
his
voice
made
a
jagged
tear
in
the
soft
quiet
evening
and
the
one
beyond
it
sarrack
why
ca
you
listen
greffington
edge
sarrack
sarrack
green
fields
coming
on
from
the
north
going
up
and
up
netted
in
with
the
strong
net
of
the
low
grey
walls
that
held
them
together
that
kept
them
safe
above
them
thin
grass
a
green
bloom
on
the
grey
face
of
the
hill
above
the
thin
grass
a
rampart
of
grey
cliffs
roddy
would
look
at
the
hill
i
tell
you
he
said
you
loathe
the
place
when
you
lived
a
week
in
it
the
thick
rich
trees
were
trying
to
climb
the
edge
but
they
get
higher
than
the
netted
fields
the
lean
ragged
firs
had
succeeded
no
not
quite
they
stood
out
against
the
sky
adventurous
mountaineers
roped
together
leaning
forward
with
the
effort
it
mamma
fault
roddy
was
saying
papa
would
have
gone
anywhere
but
she
come
to
this
damned
morfe
do
do
her
mind
beat
him
off
defending
her
happiness
he
would
kill
it
if
she
let
him
coming
up
from
reyburn
on
the
front
seat
of
the
morfe
bus
he
had
sulked
he
smiled
disagreeable
smiles
while
the
driver
pointed
with
his
whip
and
told
her
the
names
of
the
places
renton
moor
renton
church
morfe
the
grey
village
stuck
up
on
its
green
platform
under
the
high
purple
mound
of
karva
hill
garthdale
in
front
of
it
rathdale
at
its
side
meeting
in
the
fields
below
its
bridge
morfe
was
beautiful
she
loved
it
with
love
at
first
sight
faithless
to
ilford
straight
naked
houses
grey
walls
of
houses
enclosing
the
wide
oblong
green
dark
grey
stone
roofs
lest
the
wind
should
lift
them
on
the
green
two
grey
stone
pillar
fountains
a
few
wooden
benches
telegraph
poles
under
her
window
a
white
road
curling
up
to
the
platform
straight
naked
houses
zigzagging
up
beside
it
down
below
where
the
white
road
came
from
the
long
grey
raking
bridge
guarded
by
a
tall
roddy
jabbing
voice
went
on
and
on
i
used
to
think
mamma
was
holy
and
unselfish
i
do
think
so
any
more
she
says
she
wants
to
do
what
papa
wants
and
what
we
want
but
she
always
ends
by
doing
what
she
wants
herself
it
all
very
well
for
her
as
long
as
she
got
a
garden
to
poke
about
in
she
does
care
how
awful
it
is
for
us
she
hated
roddy
when
he
said
things
like
that
about
mamma
i
do
suppose
the
little
lamb
thought
about
it
at
all
or
if
she
did
she
thought
we
like
it
she
did
want
to
listen
to
roddy
grumbling
she
wanted
to
look
and
look
to
sniff
up
the
clear
sweet
exciting
smell
of
the
fields
the
roofs
went
up
the
road
straight
slant
straight
they
threw
delicate
shadows
on
to
the
field
below
that
long
pillar
was
the
shadow
of
the
by
the
bridge
the
light
came
from
somewhere
behind
the
village
from
a
sunset
you
could
see
it
made
the
smooth
hill
fields
shine
like
thin
velvet
stretched
out
clinging
to
the
hills
oh
roddy
the
light
different
different
from
ilford
look
i
been
looking
for
five
weeks
roddy
said
you
have
that
all
was
excited
at
first
he
got
up
he
stared
out
of
the
window
not
seeing
anything
i
did
mean
what
i
said
about
mamma
morfe
you
say
things
soon
it
make
you
mean
them
you
wait
she
was
glad
when
he
had
left
her
the
cliffs
of
greffington
edge
were
violet
now
ii
at
night
when
she
lay
in
bed
in
the
strange
room
the
essex
fields
began
to
haunt
her
the
five
trees
the
little
flying
trees
low
down
low
down
the
straight
narrow
paths
through
the
corn
where
she
walked
with
mark
with
jimmy
with
jourdain
jourdain
standing
in
the
path
and
saying
talk
to
me
i
alive
i
here
i
listen
mark
and
mamma
planting
the
sumach
tree
by
the
front
door
papa
saying
it
would
grow
it
had
grown
up
to
the
aunt
bella
and
uncle
edward
the
proparts
and
the
farmers
and
batty
all
stiff
and
disapproving
not
nearly
so
nice
to
you
as
they
used
to
be
and
making
you
believe
it
was
your
fault
the
old
beautiful
the
piano
by
the
door
dan
staggering
down
the
room
at
mark
party
mark
holding
her
there
in
his
arms
dawn
and
draper
carriage
waiting
in
the
road
beside
the
mangold
fields
and
aunt
charlotte
carried
out
her
feet
brushing
the
flagstones
she
must
tell
them
mamma
could
bear
it
roddy
could
bear
it
aunt
charlotte
was
papa
sister
he
must
never
know
the
sound
of
the
brushing
feet
made
her
heart
ache
she
was
glad
to
wake
in
the
small
strange
room
it
had
taken
a
snip
off
mamma
and
papa
room
on
one
side
of
the
window
and
a
snip
off
the
spare
room
on
the
other
that
made
it
a
funny
t
shape
she
slept
in
the
tail
of
the
t
in
a
narrow
bed
pushed
against
the
wall
when
you
sat
up
you
saw
the
fat
trees
trying
to
get
up
the
hill
between
the
washstand
and
the
chest
of
drawers
this
room
would
never
be
taken
from
her
because
she
was
the
only
one
who
was
small
enough
to
fit
the
bed
she
would
be
safe
there
with
her
hill
iii
the
strange
houses
fascinated
her
they
had
the
simplicity
and
the
precision
of
houses
in
a
very
old
engraving
on
the
west
side
of
the
green
they
made
a
long
straight
wall
morfe
high
row
an
open
space
of
cobblestones
stretched
in
front
of
it
the
sharp
morning
light
picked
out
the
small
black
panes
of
the
windows
in
the
white
of
their
frames
and
the
long
narrow
signs
of
the
king
head
and
the
farmer
arms
black
on
grey
the
plaster
joints
of
the
walls
and
the
dark
net
of
earth
between
the
cobbles
showed
thick
and
clear
as
in
a
very
old
engraving
the
west
side
had
the
sky
behind
it
and
the
east
side
had
the
hill
cart
roads
slanted
across
the
green
cutting
it
into
vivid
triangular
you
went
in
and
out
of
morfe
through
the
open
corners
of
its
green
her
father
house
stood
at
the
corner
by
itself
a
projecting
wing
at
that
end
of
the
high
row
screened
it
from
the
the
strange
houses
excited
her
wonderful
unknown
people
lived
in
them
you
would
see
them
and
know
what
they
were
like
the
people
in
the
tall
house
with
the
rusty
stones
in
the
bright
green
ivy
house
with
the
white
doors
in
the
small
grey
humble
houses
in
the
big
important
house
set
at
the
top
of
the
green
with
the
three
long
rows
of
windows
the
front
garden
and
the
iron
gate
people
you
did
know
you
would
be
strange
and
exciting
to
them
as
they
were
strange
and
exciting
to
you
they
might
say
interesting
things
there
might
be
somebody
who
cared
about
plato
and
spinoza
things
would
happen
that
you
did
know
anything
might
happen
any
minute
if
you
knew
what
was
happening
in
the
houses
some
of
them
had
hard
frightening
faces
dreadful
things
might
have
happened
in
them
her
father
house
had
a
good
simple
face
you
could
trust
it
five
windows
in
the
rough
grey
wall
one
on
each
side
of
the
white
door
three
above
a
garden
at
the
side
an
orchard
at
the
back
in
front
a
cobbled
square
marked
off
by
a
line
of
thin
stones
set
in
edgeways
a
strange
house
innocent
of
unhappy
memories
catty
stood
at
the
door
looking
for
her
she
called
to
her
to
come
in
to
breakfast
iv
papa
was
moving
restlessly
about
the
house
his
loose
slippers
shuffled
on
the
stone
flags
of
the
passages
catty
stopped
gathering
up
the
breakfast
cups
to
listen
catty
was
not
what
she
used
to
be
her
plump
cheeks
were
sunk
and
flattened
some
day
she
would
look
like
jenny
papa
stood
in
the
doorway
he
looked
round
the
small
as
if
he
were
still
puzzled
by
its
strangeness
papa
was
not
what
he
used
to
be
a
streak
of
grey
hair
showed
above
each
ear
grey
patches
in
his
brown
beard
scarlet
smears
in
the
veined
sallow
of
his
eyes
his
bursting
violent
life
had
gone
he
went
stooping
and
shuffling
the
house
was
too
small
for
papa
he
turned
in
it
as
a
dog
turns
in
his
kennel
feeling
for
a
place
to
stretch
himself
he
said
where
your
mother
i
want
her
mary
went
to
find
her
she
knew
the
house
the
flagged
passage
from
the
front
door
the
on
the
right
the
on
the
left
in
there
the
chairs
and
tables
drew
together
to
complain
of
morfe

of

into

her
mother
was
there
sitting
in
the
reading
the
fourteenth
chapter
of
john
let
not
your
heart
be
troubled
ye
believe
in
god
believe
also
in
me
in
my
father
house
are
many
mansions
mamma
was
different
too
as
if
she
had
shrunk
through
living
in
the
cramped
rooms
she
raised
her
head
the
head
of
a
wounded
bird
very
gentle
why
are
you
sitting
up
here
all
alone
because
sometimes
i
want
to
be
alone
shall
i
spoil
the
aloneness
not
if
you
a
good
girl
and
keep
quiet
mary
sat
on
the
bed
and
waited
till
the
chapter
should
be
ended
she
thought
she
talks
to
me
still
as
though
i
were
a
child
what
would
she
say
if
i
told
her
about
aunt
charlotte
she
would
know
what
it
was
really
like
she
was
there
i
shall
never
tell
her
she
was
thrilled
at
the
thought
of
her
hardness
her
silence
keeping
her
mother
safe
mamma
looked
up
and
smiled
the
chapter
was
ended
they
went
downstairs
papa
stood
in
the
doorway
of
his
den
and
called
to
mamma
in
a
queer
low
voice
the
letters
she
went
into
the
and
waited
ten
minutes
twenty
her
mother
came
to
her
there
she
sat
down
in
her
armchair
by
the
where
the
old
stood
piled
with
socks
ready
for
darning
she
took
a
sock
and
drew
it
over
her
hand
stretching
it
to
find
the
worn
places
mary
took
its
fellow
and
began
to
darn
it
the
coarse
wool
scraping
her
sent
through
her
a
little
light
creeping
disagreeable
shock
she
was
afraid
to
look
at
her
mother
face
well
mary
poor
aunt
charlotte
might
have
been
carried
away
in
her
coffin
and
we
should
have
known
if
it
had
been
left
to
you
to
tell
us
i
did
because
i
thought
it
would
frighten
you
mamma
was
not
frightened
they
could
have
told
her
what
it
was
really
like
papa
slippers
shuffled
in
the
passage
mamma
left
off
darning
to
listen
as
catty
had
listened
on
greffington
edge
roddy
was
looking
like
mark
with
his
eyes
very
steady
and
his
mouth
firm
and
proud
his
face
was
red
as
if
he
were
angry
that
was
when
he
saw
the
tall
man
coming
towards
them
down
the
hill
road
roddy
walked
slowly
trying
not
to
meet
him
at
the
the
tall
man
walked
faster
and
they
met
roddy
opened
the
gate
the
tall
man
thanked
him
said
good
day
looked
at
her
as
he
passed
through
then
stopped
my
sister
mr
sutcliffe
sutcliffe
handsome
with
his
boney
nose
and
narrow
jaw
thrust
out
incongruously
fierce
under
his
calm
clean
upper
lip
shaved
to
show
how
beautiful
it
was
his
black
blue
eyes
were
set
as
carefully
in
their
lids
as
a
woman
he
wore
his
hair
rather
long
one
lock
had
got
loose
and
hung
before
his
ear
like
a
high
whisker
he
was
asking
roddy
when
he
was
coming
to
play
tennis
and
whether
his
sister
played
they
might
turn
up
tomorrow
the
light
played
on
his
curling
handsome
smile
he
hoped
she
liked
rathdale
she
only
came
yesterday
roddy
said
well
come
along
about
four
i
tell
my
wife
and
roddy
said
thanks
as
if
it
choked
him
sutcliffe
went
on
down
the
hill
we
ca
go
roddy
said
why
not
well
let
he
looked
so
nice
and
he
sounded
as

does
he
ca

know
what
happened

thing

she
think
us
skunks
if

wanted
something
to
happen
and
something

happened
something
that
would
bring
unhappiness
unhappiness
her
will
rose
up
hard
and
stubborn
pushing
it
off
will
it
matter
so
very
much

sutcliffes

much
that

do
care
a
bit
as
long
as
i
have
you
me
me
he
had
stopped
on
the
steep
of
the
road
her
feet
had
been
lagging
to
keep
pace
with
him
he
breathed
hard
through
lips
she
had
seen
him
look
like
that
before
the
day
they
had
walked
to
the
thames
to
look
at
the
ships
over
the
windy
flats
he
looked
at
her
a
look
she
had
seen
before
a
look
of
passionate
unbelief
i
did
think
you
cared
about
me
i
thought
it
was
mark
you
cared
about
like
mamma
ca
you
care
about
more
than
one
person
mamma
ca
oh
roddy
what
the
good
of
saying
roddy
when
you
know
it
they
were
sitting
on
a
ledge
of
stone
and
turf
roddy
had
ceased
to
struggle
with
the
hill
we
all
the
same
he
said
i
give
you
and
dan
up
any
day
for
mark
dan
would
give
up
you
and
me
mark
would
give
up
all
of
us
for
mamma
and
mamma
would
give
up
all
of
us
for
mark
roddy
had
never
said
anything
like
that
before
i
stick
to
you
anyhow
she
said
it
no
use
your
sticking
i
sha
be
here
i
shall
have
to
clear
out
and
do
something
he
said
on
his
face
there
was
a
look
of
fear
vi
she
was
excited
because
they
were
going
to
the
ivy
house
for
tea
it
looked
so
pretty
and
so
happy
with
its
green
face
shining
in
the
sun
nothing
could
take
from
her
her
belief
in
happiness
hiding
behind
certain
unknown
doors
it
hid
behind
the
white
doors
of
the
ivy
house
when
you
went
in
something
wonderful
would
happen
the
ivy
house
belonged
to
waugh
and
miss
frewin
the
photographs
in
mamma
old
album
showed
how
they
looked
when
they
and
mamma
were
young
modest
pose
of
dropped
arms
holding
mushroom
hats
in
front
of
them
as
a
protection
the
narrow
ribbons
dangling
innocently
ellen
frewin
small
and
upright
slender
back
curved
in
to
the
set
of
shawl
and
crinoline
prim
head
fixed
in
the
composure
of
gentle
disdain
small
mouth
saying
always
oh
meta
the
younger
sister
very
tall
head
bent
in
tranquil
meditation
her
mantle
slanting
out
from
the
fall
of
the
thin
shoulders
they
rose
up
in
the
small
green
lighted
their
heads
bent
forward
to
kiss
ellen
waugh
the
photographed
face
still
keeping
its
lifted
posture
of
gentle
disdain
the
skin
stretched
like
a
pale
tight
glove
a
slight
downward
swelling
of
the
prim
oval
like
the
last
bulge
of
a
sucked
peppermint
ball
the
faded
mouth
still
making
its
small
oh
she
was
the
widow
of
a
clergyman
meta
a
beautiful
nose
leaping
out
at
you
in
a
high
curve
narrow
delicate
cheeks
thinned
away
so
that
they
seemed
part
of
the
nose
sweet
rodent
mouth
smiling
up
under
its
tip
blurred
violet
eyes
arching
vaguely
princess
gowns
stiffened
their
shawl
and
crinoline
gestures
so
this
is
mary
she
not
like
her
mother
caroline
meta
can
you
see
any
likeness
miss
frewin
arched
her
eyes
and
smiled
without
looking
at
you
i
ca
say
i
do
their
heads
made
little
nodding
bows
as
they
talked
miss
frewin
bow
was
sidelong
and
slow
waugh
straight
and
decisive
she
not
like
rodney
waugh
said
and
she
not
like
emilius
who
is
she
like
mary
answered
i
rather
like
dan
and
a
good
bit
like
mark
but
most
of
all
like
myself
waugh
said
oh
her
mouth
went
on
saying
it
while
she
looked
at
you
she
is
not
in
the
least
like
mark
mamma
said
they
settled
down
one
on
each
side
of
mamma
smiling
at
her
with
their
small
faded
mouths
as
you
smile
at
people
you
love
and
are
happy
with
you
could
see
that
mamma
was
happy
too
sitting
between
them
safe
waugh
said
i
see
you
got
blenkiron
in
again
well
he
left
his
ladder
in
the
yard
i
suppose
that
means
he
mend
the
kitchen
chimney
some
time
before
winter
the
yorkshire
workmen
are
very
independent
waugh
said
they
scamp
their
work
like
the
rest
you
need
a
resident
carpenter
and
a
resident
glazier
and
a
resident
plumber
yes
caroline
you
would
indeed
gentle
voices
saying
things
you
had
heard
before
in
the
at
five
elms
miss
frewin
had
opened
a
black
silk
bag
that
hung
on
her
arm
and
taken
out
a
minute
pair
of
scissors
and
a
long
strip
of
white
stuff
with
a
stitched
pattern
on
it
she
nicked
out
the
pattern
into
little
holes
outlined
by
the
stitches
mary
watched
her
fascinated
by
the
delicate
movements
of
the
thin
fingers
and
the
slanted
drooping
postures
of
the
head
do
you
doing
it
yes
she
thought
what
a
fool
she
must
think
me
as
if
she
do
it
if
she
did
like
it
the
arching
eyes
and
twitching
mouth
smiled
at
your
foolishness
waugh
voice
went
on
it
came
smoothly
hardly
moving
her
small
round
mouth
that
was
her
natural
voice
then
suddenly
it
rose
like
a
voice
that
calls
to
you
to
get
up
in
the
morning
well
mary
so
you
left
school
come
home
to
be
a
help
to
your
mother
a
high
false
cheerfulness
covering
disapproval
and
reproach
their
gentleness
was
cold
to
her
and
secretly
inimical
they
had
asked
her
because
of
mamma
they
did
really
want
her
six
it
was
all
over
they
were
going
home
across
the
green
mary
i
wish
you
could
learn
to
talk
without
affectation
telling
waugh
you
like
yourself
if
you
could
only
manage
to
forget
yourself
your
self
your
self
why
should
you
forget
it
you
had
to
remember
they
would
kill
it
if
you
let
them
what
had
it
done
what
it
that
they
should
hate
it
so
it
had
been
happy
and
excited
about
wondering
what
they
would
be
like
and
quiet
looking
on
and
listening
in
the
strange
room
crushed
by
the
gentle
hostile
voices
would
it
always
have
to
stoop
and
cringe
before
people
hushing
its
own
voice
hiding
its
own
gesture
it
crouched
now
stung
and
beaten
hiding
in
her
body
that
walked
beside
her
mother
with
proud
feet
and
small
lifted
head
vii
her
mother
turned
at
her
bedroom
door
and
signed
to
her
to
come
in
she
sat
down
in
her
low
chair
at
the
head
of
the
curtained
bed
mary
sat
in
the
there
something
i
want
to
say
to
you
yes
mamma
mamma
was
annoyed
she
with
her
foot
on
the
floor
have
you
given
up
those
absurd
ideas
of
yours
what
absurd
ideas
you
know
what
i
mean
calling
yourself
an
unbeliever
i
say
i
believe
things
i
do
believe
have
you
tried
tried
have
you
ever
asked
god
to
help
your
unbelief
no
i
could
only
do
that
if
i
did
believe
in
my
unbelief
you
mean
if
you
did
glory
in
it
then
it
simply
your
and
your
pride
has
been
your
besetting
sin
ever
since
you
were
a
little
baby
crying
for
something
you
could
have
you
kicked
before
you
could
talk
goodness
knows
i
done
everything
i
could
to
break
you
of
it
yes
mamma
darling
she
remembered
the
faded
green
and
grey
curtains
and
the
yellow
birchwood
furniture
remembered
mamma
sat
on
the
little
chair
at
the
foot
of
the
big
yellow
bed
you
knelt
in
her
lap
and
played
with
the
gold
tassel
while
mamma
asked
you
to
give
up
your
will
i
brought
you
up
to
care
for
god
and
for
the
truth
you
did
and
i
care
so
awfully
for
both
of
them
that
i
wo
believe
things
about
god
that
are
true
and
how
do
you
know
what
true
and
what
is
you
set
up
your
little
judgment
against
all
the
wise
and
learned
people
who
believe
as
you
were
taught
to
believe
i
wonder
how
you
dare
it
the
risk
we
all
taking
we
may
every
single
one
of
us
be
wrong
still
if
some
things
are
true
other
things
ca
be
do
look
so
unhappy
mamma
how
can
i
be
anything
else
when
i
think
of
you
living
without
god
in
the
world
and
of
what
will
happen
to
you
when
you
die
it
your
belief
that
makes
you
unhappy
not
me
that
the
cruellest
thing
you
said
yet
you
know
i
rather
die
than
hurt
you
die
indeed
when
you
hurt
me
every
minute
of
the
day
if
it
had
been
anything
but
unbelief
if
i
even
saw
you
humble
and
sorry
about
it
but
you
seem
to
be
positively
enjoying
yourself
i
ca
help
it
if
the
things
i
think
of
make
me
happy
and
you
know
how
nice
it
feels
to
be
free
precious
freedom
to
do
what
you
like
and
think
what
you
like
without
caring
there
a
part
of
me
that
does
care
and
there
a
part
that
cares
frightfully
the
part
that
cared
was
not
free
not
free
prisoned
in
her
bedroom
with
the
yellow
furniture
that
remembered
her
mother
face
that
remembered
always
the
same
vexed
disapproving
remembering
face
and
her
own
heart
sinking
at
each
beat
dragging
remembrance
a
dead
child
remembering
and
returning
i
ca
think
where
you
got
it
from
her
mother
was
saying
unless
it
those
books
you
always
reading
or
was
it
that
man
what
man
maurice
jourdain
no
it
was
what
made
you
think
of
him
never
you
mind
actually
her
mother
was
smiling
and
trying
not
to
smile
as
if
she
were
thinking
of
something
funny
and
improper
there
one
thing
i
must
beg
of
you
she
said
that
whatever
you
choose
to
think
you
hold
your
tongue
about
it
all
my
life
like
aunt
lavvy
there
was
a
reason
why
then
and
there
a
reason
why
now
your
father
has
been
very
unfortunate
we
here
in
a
new
place
and
the
less
we
make
ourselves
conspicuous
the
better
i
see
she
thought
because
papa
drinks
mamma
and
roddy
go
proud
and
angry
but
i
must
stoop
and
hide
it
is
fair
you
surely
do
want
her
mother
said
to
make
it
harder
for
me
than
it
is
tears
she
was
beaten
i
do
want
to
make
it
hard
for
you
at
all
then
promise
me
you
wo
talk
about
religion
i
wo
talk
about
it
to
mrs
waugh
not
to
anybody
not
to
anybody
who
would
like
it
unless
they
make
me
will

up

child
to
be
kissed
viii
the
sutcliffes
house
hid
in
the
thick
trees
at
the
foot
of
greffington
edge
you
could
see
it
you
could
pretend
it
was
there
you
could
pretend
that
sutcliffe
and
sutcliffe
were
not
there
you
could
pretend
that
nothing
had
happened
there
were
other
houses
ix
the
long
house
at
the
top
of
the
green
was
gay
with
rows
of
pink
and
white
stuck
out
like
attic
roofs
the
poplars
in
the
garden
played
their
play
of
falling
rain
you
waited
in
the
porch
impatient
for
the
opening
of
the
door
mamma
what
it
be
like
mamma
smiled
a
naughty
pretty
smile
she
knew
what
it
would
be
like
there
was
a
stuffed
salmon
in
a
long
glass
case
in
the
hall
he
swam
over
a
brown
plaster
river
bed
glued
to
a
plaster
stream
you
waited
in
the
drab
and
dying
amber
and
the
dapple
of
walnut
wood
chairs
dressed
in
pallid
chintz
holding
out
their
skirts
with
an
air
of
anxiety
stuffed
on
a
branch
under
a
tall
glass
shade
on
the
pampas
grass
in
clear
vases
and
a
white
marble
clock
supporting
a
gilt
cupid
astride
over
a
gilt
ball
above
the
cupid
in
an
oval
frame
the
tinted
crayon
portrait
of
a
young
girl
a
pink
and
blond
young
girl
with
a
soft
nuzzling
mouth
and
nose
she
was
dressed
in
a
spencer
and
a
wide
straw
hat
and
carried
a
basket
of
flowers
on
her
arm
she
looked
happy
smiling
up
at
the
ceiling
across
the
passage
a
door
opening
voices
in
the
passage
a
smell
like
rotten
apples
a
tray
that
clattered
miss
kendal
rustled
in
tall
elegant
stiffness
girded
in
black
silk
how
good
of
you
to
come
olivier
and
to
bring
miss
mary
her
body
was
like
the
chair
it
sat
on
yet
you
saw
that
she
had
once
been
the
young
girl
in
the
spencer
head
carried
high
with
the
remembered
tilt
of
the
girl
head
jaw
pushed
out
at
the
chin
as
if
it
hung
lightly
from
the
edge
of
the
upper
lip
the
nuzzling
mouth
composed
to
prudence
and
propriety
a
lace
cap
with
pink
ribbons
perched
on
her
smooth
ashy
blond
hair
miss
kendal
talked
to
mamma
about
weather
and
gardens
she
asked
after
the
kitchen
chimney
as
if
she
really
cared
for
it
every
now
and
then
she
looked
at
you
and
gave
you
a
nod
and
a
smile
to
show
that
she
remembered
you
were
there
when
she
smiled
her
eyes
were
happy
like
the
eyes
of
the
young
girl
the
clicked
and
fell
to
with
a
clang
a
bell
clamoured
suddenly
through
the
quiet
house
miss
kendal
nodded
the
doctor
has
come
to
tea
to
see
miss
mary
she
put
her
arm
in
yours
and
led
you
into
the
gaily
gaily
as
if
she
had
known
you
for
a
long
time
as
if
she
were
taking
you
with
her
to
some
brilliant
happy
feast
the
smell
of
rotten
apples
came
towards
you
through
the
open
door
of
the
you
saw
the
shining
of
pure
white
damask
the
flashing
of
silver
a
of
blue
willow
pattern
cups
an
enormous
pink
and
white
cake
you
thought
it
was
a
party
three
old
men
were
there
old
kendal
six
feet
of
leanness
doubled
up
in
an
old
wellington
face
shrunk
cheeks
burning
in
a
senile
raddle
glassy
blue
eyes
weeping
from
red
rims
charles
kendal
his
son
a
hard
blond
giant
high
cheeks
raw
ruddied
high
bleak
nose
jutting
out
with
a
steep
fall
to
the
long
upper
lip
savage
mouth
under
a
straight
blond
fringe
a
shark
keen
tooth
pointing
at
the
dropped
jaw
arched
forehead
drooping
to
the
spread
ears
blond
eyebrows
drooping
over
slack
lids
and
james
james
was
the
only
short
one
he
stood
apart
his
eyes
edging
off
from
his
limp
james
had
a
red
face
and
high
bleak
nose
like
his
brother
he
was
except
for
short
auburn
whiskers
brushed
forward
in
flat
curls
his
thin
wellington
lips
went
out
and
in
pressed
together
trying
hard
not
to
laugh
at
you
he
held
his
arms
bowed
out
stiffly
as
if
the
of
his
coat
were
too
tight
for
him
the
room
was
light
at
the
far
end
where
the
two
windows
were
and
dark
at
the
where
the
mahogany
sideboard
was
the
bright
loaded
table
stretched
between
old
kendal
sat
behind
it
by
the
corner
of
the
fireplace
though
it
was
august
the
windows
were
shut
and
a
fire
burned
in
the
grate
two
tabby
cats
sat
up
by
the
fender
blinking
and
nodding
with
sleep
here

james
place
at
the
foot
of
the
table
he
made
her
sit
at
his
left
hand
and
mamma
at
his
right
and
he
slanted
mamma
chair
and
fixed
a
basket
screen
on
its
back
so
that
she
was
shielded
both
from
the
fire
and
from
the
presence
of
the
old
man

talked
where

thin
face

he
looked
at
you
with
small
grey
eyes
blinking
under
weak
lids
and
bared
the
shark
tooth
smiling
a
kind
hungry
shark

this
child

eat
enough
to
keep
a
mouse
mrs
olivier
he
would
leave
off
talking
now
and
then
to
eat
and
in
the
silence
remarkable
noises
would
come
from
the
armchair
when
that
happened
miss
kendal
would
look
under
the
table
and
pretend
that
minnie
and
johnnie
were
fighting
oh
those
bad
pussies
she
would
say
when
her
face
kept
quiet
it
looked
dead
beside
the
ruddy
faces
of
the
three
old
men
dead
and
very
quietly
very
softly
decomposing
into
bleached
purple
and
sallow
white
then
her
gaiety
would
come
popping
up
again
and
jerk
it
back
into
life
james
sat
at
her
corner
beside
mary
he
did
talk
but
his
wellington
mouth
moved
perpetually
in
and
out
and
his
small
reddish
eyes
twinkled
twinkled
with
a
shrewd
secret
mirth
you
thought
every
minute
he
would
burst
out
laughing
and
you
wondered
what
you
were
doing
to
amuse
him
so
every
now
and
then
miss
kendal
would
tell
you
something
about
him
what
do
you
think
james
did
he
walked
all
the
way
to
garth
and
back
again
over
nine
miles
and
james
would
look
gratified
tea
was
over
with
the
sacrifice
of
the
pink
and
white
cake
miss
kendal
took
your
arm
again
and
led
you
gaily
gaily
back
to
the
old
man
here
miss
mary
come
to
talk
to
you
father
she
set
a
chair
for
you
beside
him
he
turned
his
head
slowly
to
you
waking
out
of
his
doze
what
did
she
say
your
name
was
my
dear
olivier
mary
olivier
i
do
call
to
mind
anybody
of
that
name
in
the
dale
but
i
suppose
i
brought
you
into
the
world
same
as
the
rest
of
miss
kendal
gave
a
little
bound
in
her
chair
does
anybody
know
where
pussy
is
the
claw
hand
stirred
in
the
red
and
yellow
ye
come
to
see
the
old
man
have
ye
ay
eh
when
he
talked
he
coughed
a
dreadful
sound
as
if
he
dragged
up
out
of
himself
a
long
rattling
chain
it
hurt
you
to
look
at
him
pity
hurt
you
once
he
had
been
young
like
roddy
then
he
had
been
with
hanging
jaw
and
weak
eyelids
like
charles
now
he
was
old
old
he
sat
doubled
up
coughing
and
weeping
in
a
chair
but
you
could
see
that
miss
kendal
was
proud
of
him
she
thought
him
wonderful
because
he
kept
on
living
supposing
he
was
father
and
you
had
to
sit
with
him
all
your
life
in
a
room
smelling
of
rotten
apples
could
you
bear
it
could
you
bear
it
for
a
fortnight
would
you
wish
would
you
wish
supposing
papa
all
your
life
but
if
you
could
bear
it
that
would
mean
no
no
she
put
her
hand
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
to
protect
him
to
protect
him
from
her
thoughts
the
claw
fingers
scrabbled
groping
for
her
hand
would
ye
like
to
be
an
old
man
pussy
says
it
is
her
yet
father
when
you
went
away
miss
kendal
stood
on
the
doorstep
looking
after
you
the
last
you
saw
of
her
was
a
soft
grimace
of
innocent
gaiety
x
the
vicar
of
renton
he
wanted
to
see
her
mamma
had
left
her
in
the
room
with
him
going
out
with
an
air
of
connivance
spencer
rollitt
hard
and
handsome
large
face
bare
of
any
accent
except
its
eyebrows
its
mouth
a
thin
straight
line
hardly
visible
in
its
sunburn
small
blue
eyes
standing
still
in
the
sunburn
hard
and
cold
when
rollitt
wanted
to
express
heartiness
he
had
to
fall
back
on
gesture
on
the
sudden
flash
of
white
teeth
he
drew
in
his
breath
sharply
between
the
straight
close
lips
with
a
sound
she
watched
him
under
his
small
handsome
nose
his
mouth
and
chin
together
made
one
steep
straight
line
this
lower
face
flat
and
naked
without
lips
stretched
like
another
forehead
at
the
top
of
the
real
forehead
where
his
hat
had
saved
his
skin
a
straight
band
white
like
a
scar
yet
spencer
rollitt
hair
curled
and
clustered
out
at
the
back
of
his
head
in
perfect
innocence
he
was
smiling
his
muscular
smile
while
his
little
hard
cold
eyes
held
her
in
their
tight
stare
do
you
think
you
would
like
to
take
a
class
in
my
sunday
school
i
afraid
i
would
like
it
at
all
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
i
should
give
you
the
infants
school
for
a
long
time
he
sat
there
explaining
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
and
that
he
would
give
her
the
infants
school
you
felt
him
filling
the
room
crushing
you
back
and
back
forcing
his
will
on
you
there
was
too
much
of
his
will
too
much
of
his
face
her
will
rose
up
against
his
will
and
against
his
face
and
its
false
muscular
smile
i
sure
my
mother
did
say
i
like
to
teach
in
a
sunday
school
she
said
she
be
very
glad
if
i
could
persuade
you
she
say
but
she
knows
perfectly
well
i
would
really
do
it
it
was
not
olivier
idea
he
got
up
when
he
stood
his
eyes
stared
at
nothing
away
over
your
head
he
would
lower
them
to
look
at
you
it
was
mrs
sutcliffe
how
funny
of
sutcliffe
she
does
know
me
either
my
dear
young
lady
you
were
at
school
when
your
father
and
mother
dined
at
greffington
hall
he
was
looking
down
at
her
now
and
she
could
feel
herself
blushing
hot
red
waves
of
shame
rushing
up
tingling
in
the
roots
of
her
hair
sutcliffe
he
said
is
very
kind
she
saw
it
now
he
had
been
at
the
sutcliffes
that
evening
he
had
seen
papa
he
was
trying
to
say
your
father
was
drunk
at
greffington
hall
he
will
never
be
asked
there
again
he
will
not
be
particularly
welcome
at
the
vicarage
but
you
are
very
young
we
do
not
wish
you
to
suffer
this
is
our
kindness
to
you
take
it
you
are
not
in
a
position
to
refuse
and
what
am
i
to
say
to
mrs
sutcliffe
oh
anything
you
like
that
would
sound
too
rude
shall
i
say
that
you
a
very
independent
young
lady
and
that
she
had
better
not
ask
you
to
join
her
would
that
sound
too
rude
not
a
bit
if
you
put
it
nicely
but
you
would
would
you
he
looked
down
at
her
again
his
thick
eyes
had
thawed
slightly
they
let
out
a
twinkle
but
he
was
holding
his
lips
so
tight
that
they
had
disappeared
a
loud
surprising
laugh
forced
them
open
he
held
out
his
hand
with
a
gesture
drawing
back
his
laugh
in
a
tremendous
when
he
had
gone
she
opened
the
piano
and
played
and
played
through
the
window
of
the
room
chopin
fontana
polonaise
went
out
after
him
joyous
triumphant
and
defiant
driving
him
before
it
she
exulted
in
her
power
over
the
polonaise
nothing
could
touch
you
nothing
could
hurt
you
while
you
played
if
only
you
could
go
on
playing
for
ever
her
mother
came
in
from
the
garden
mary
she
said
if
you
play
you
must
play
gently
but
mamma
i
ca
it
goes
like
that
then
said
her
mother
do

can
be
heard
all
over
the
village
bother
the
village
i
do
care
i
do
care
if
i
heard
all
over
everywhere
she
went
on
playing
but
it
was
no
use
she
struck
a
wrong
note
her
hands
trembled
and
lost
their
grip
they
stiffened
dropped
from
the
keys
she
sat
and
stared
idiotically
at
the
white
page
at
the
black
dots
nodding
on
their
stems
at
the
black
bars
swaying
she
had
forgotten
how
to
play
chopin
fontana
polonaise
xi
stone

a
wild
country
caught
in
the
net
of
the
stone
walls
stone
walls
following
the
planes
of
the
land
running
straight
along
the
valleys
switchbacking
up
and
down
the

of
the
green
mounds
stone
walls
piled
loosely
with
the
brute
skill
of
building
centuries
ago
they
bulged
they
toppled
yet
they
stood
firm
holding
the
wild
country
in
their
mesh
knitting
the
grey
villages
to
the
grey
farms
and
the
farms
to
the
grey
byres
where
you
thought
the
net
had
ended

flung
out
a
grey
rope
over
the
purple
back
of

the
green
shoulder
of
greffington
outside

trench
sunk
between

walls
went
up
and
up
turning
three
times
at
the
top
of
the
last
turn
a
gate
when
you
had
got
through
the
gate
you
were
free
it
led
on
to
the
wide
flat
of
moor
that
lay
under
karva
the
moor
and
the
high
mound
of
the
hill
were
free
they
had
slipped
from
the
net
of
the
walls
broad
cut
through
the
moor
inlets
of
green
grass
forked
into

green
streamed
through

lapped
against

pointed
picked
clean
by

flickering
grey
over

towards

the
black

grey
ran
together
like
ink
and
water
stilled
into
purple
the
black
purple
of
grapes
if
you
shut
your
eyes
you
could
see
the
flat
essex
country
spread
in
a
thin
film
over
karva
thinner
and
thinner
but
you
could
remember
what
it
had
been
like
low
tilled
fields
thin
trees
sharp
queer
uncertain
beauty
sharp
queer
uncertain
happiness
coming
again
and
again
never
twice
to
the
same
place
in
the
same
way
it
hurt
you
when
you
remembered
it
the
beauty
of
the

was
not
like
that
it
stayed
it
waited
for
you
keeping
faith
day
after

night
after
night
it
was
there
happiness
was
there
you
were
sure
of
it
every

for
you
they
stood
back
as
you
passed
staring
at
you
with
their
look
of
wonder
and
sadness
grouse
shot
up
from
your
feet
with
a
in
sudden
explosive
flight
plovers
rose
wheeling
round
and
round
you
with
sharper
and
sharper
cries
of
agitation
they
swooped
suddenly
close
close
to
your
eyes
you
heard
the
drumming
vibration
of
their
wings
away
in
front
a
line
of
sheep
went
slowly
up
and
up

the
hill
made
their
bleating
mournful
and
musical
you
slipped

into

and
tired
waiting

i
wish

go
and
see
where
your
father

looked
up
from
his
he
had
filled
it
with
pictures
of
cavalry
on
plunging
chargers
trains
of
artillery
rushing
into
battle
sailing
ships
in
heavy
seas
roddy
mind
was
possessed
by
images
of
danger
and
adventure
he
flourished
off
the
last
wave
of
and
shut
the
with
a
snap
mamma
knew
perfectly
well
where
papa
was
roddy

catty
and
maggie
the
cook
knew
everybody
in
the
village
knew
regularly
about

in
the
evening

shuffled
out
of
the
house
and
along
the
high
row
to
the
buck
hotel
and
towards
roddy
had
to
go
and
bring
him
back
everybody
knew
what
he
went
for
he
would
have
to
hold
papa
tight
by
the
arm
and
lead
him
over
the
cobblestones
they
would
pass
the
long
bench
at
the
corner
under
the
kendals
wall
and
oldshaw
the
banker
and
horn
the
grocer
and
acroyd
the
shoemaker
would
be
sitting
there
talking
to
belk
who
was
justice
of
the
peace
and
they
would
see
papa
the
young
men
squatting
on
the
flagstones
outside
the
farmer
arms
and
the
head
would
see
him
and
papa
would
stiffen
and
draw
himself
up
trying
to
look
dignified
and
sober
when
he
was
very
bad
mamma
would
cry
quietly
all
through
but
she
would
never
admit
that
he
went
to
the
buck
hotel
he
had
just
gone
off
nobody
knew
where
and
roddy

got
to

of

bitter
triumph

could
only
look
at
him
with
bright
shy
eyes
like
a
hare
roddy
and
mary
were
going
up
the
garthdale
road
at
the
first
turn
they
saw
waugh

her

roddy
said
he
began
to
walk
with
a
queer
defiant
jerk
waugh
came
on
buoyantly
as
if
the
hoop
of
a
crinoline
still
held
her
up
well
mary
going
for
another
walk
she
stopped
in
a
gracious
mood
to
show
off
her
son
when
she
looked
at
roddy
her
raised
eyebrows
said
still
here
doing
nothing
norman
going
back
to
work
on
monday
she
said
the
son
stood
aside
uninterested
impatient
staring
past
them
beating
the
road
with
his
stick
he
was
thickset
and
square
he
had
the
stooping
head
and
heavy
eyes
of
a
bull
black
hair
and
eyebrows
grew
bushily
from
his
frewin
skin
he
would
be
an
engineer
belk
brother
had
taken
him
into
his
works
at
durlingham
he
was
seventeen
yet
he
knew
how
to
make
engines
he
had
a
strong
lumbering
body
his
heart
would
go
on
with
regular
strokes
like
a
stupid
piston
not
like
roddy
heart
excited
quivering
hurrying
suddenly
checking
his
eyes
drew
his
mother
away
you
were
glad
when
they
were
gone
you
can
see
what
they
think
roddy
said
everybody

beastly
rheumatic
fever

in
the
navy
or
the
merchant
service
now
it
all
rot
not
passing
you
as
if
walking
about
on
a
ship
deck
was
worse
for
your
heart
than
digging
in
a
garden
it
certainly
could
be
worse
than
farming
in
canada
farming
in
canada
that
her
idea
it
kill
me
to
do
what
want
it
wo
kill
me
to

he
brooded
mark

what
he
wanted
he
went
away
and
left
her
brute
as
i

i
would
have
done
that
she
does
know
that
why
i
sticking
here
i
leave
her
i
rather
die
roddy
too
he
had
always
seemed
to
go
his
own
way
without
caring
living
his
secret
life
running
jumping
grinning
at
you
and
he
too
was
compelled
to
adore
mark
and
yet
to
cling
helplessly
hopelessly
to
mamma
when
he
said
things
about
her
he
was
struggling
against
her
trying
to
free
himself
he
flung
himself
off
and
came
back
to
cling
harder
and
he
was
nineteen
after
all
he
said
why
should
i
stay
it
not
as
if
i
did
dig
in
the
garden
and
look
after
papa
if
i
went
she
have
to
get
somebody
i
thought
you
wanted
to
go
she
said
so
i
did
so
i
do
for
some
things
but
when
it
comes
to
the
point
when
it
comes
to
the
point
i
funk
it
because
of
mamma
because
of
me
that
idiocy
supposing
i
to
do
something
i
do
that
why
i
shall
have
to
go
away
somewhere
where
it
matter
where
she
wo
know
anything
about
it
the
frightened
look
was
in
his
eyes
again
in
her
heart
a
choking
breathless
voice
talked
of
unhappiness
coming
coming
unhappiness
that
no
beauty
could
assuage
her
will
hardened
to
shut
it
out
when
the
road
turned
again
they
met
james
he
walked
with
queer
jerky
steps
his
arms
bowed
out
stiffly
as
he
passed
he
edged
away
from
you
his
mouth
moved
as
if
he
were
trying
not
to
laugh
they
knew
about
james
now
his
mind
had
grown
since
he
was
five
years
old
he
could
do
nothing
but
walk
martha
the
old
servant
dressed
and
undressed
him
i
shall
have
to
go
roddy
said
if
i
stay
here
i
shall
look
like
james
i
shall
walk
with
my
arms
bowed
out
catty
dress
and
undress

they
hated
the
piano
they
had
pushed
it
away
against
the
dark
outside
wall
its
strings
were
stiff
with
cold
and
when
the
rain
came
its
wooden
hammers
swelled
so
that
two
notes
struck
together
in
the
bass
the
made
them
move
it
to
the
inner
wall
in
the
large
bright
place
that
belonged
to
the
cabinet
mamma
was
annoyed
because
mary
had
taken
the
part
mamma
loved
the
cabinet
she
could
bear
to
see
it
standing
in
the
piano
dark
corner
where
the
green
chinese
bowls
hardly
showed
behind
the
black
glimmer
of
the
panes
the
light
fell
full
on
the
ragged
faded
silk
of
the
piano
and
on
the
long
scar
across
its
lid
it
was
like
a
poor
shabby
relation
it
stood
there
in
the
quiet
room
with
its
lid
shut
patient
reproachful
waiting
for
you
to
come
and
play
on
it
when
mary
thought
of
the
piano
her
heart
beat
faster
her
fingers
twitched
the
full
sensitive
tips
tingled
and
ached
to
play
when
she
could
play
she
lay
awake
at
night
thinking
of
the
music
she
was
trying
to
learn
the
sonato
going
through
it
bar
by
bar
slowly
and
softly
so
that
nobody
outside
the
room
should
hear
it
that
was
better
than
not
playing
it
at
all
but
sometimes
you
would
forget
and
as
soon
as
you
struck
the
loud
chords
in
the
first
movement
papa
would
come
in
and
stop
you
and
the
sonata
would
go
on
sounding
inside
you
trying
to
make
you
play
it
giving
you
no
peace
towards
six
she
listened
for
his
feet
in
the
flagged
passage
when
the
front
door
slammed
behind
him
she
rushed
to
the
piano
there
might
be
a
whole
hour
before
roddy
fetched
him
from
the
buck
hotel
if
you
could
only
reach
the
last
movement
the
two
thundering
chords
and
then
the
the
music
beat
on
the
thick
stone
walls
of
the
room
and
was
beaten
back
its
fine
live
throbbing
blunted
by
overtones
of
discord
you
longed
to
open
all
the
doors
and
windows
of
the
house
to
push
back
the
stone
walls
and
let
it
out
terrible
minutes
to
six
when
mamma
face
watched
and
listened
when
she
knew
what
you
were
thinking
you
kept
on
looking
at
the
clock
you
wondered
whether
this
time
papa
would
really
go
you
hoped
mamma
eyes
hurt
you
they
said
she
does
care
what
becomes
of
him
so
long
as
she
can
play
ii
sometimes
the
wounded
mutilated
would
cry
inside
you
all
day
imploring
you
to
finish
it
to
let
it
pour
out
its
life
in
joy
when
it
left
off
the
white
sound
patterns
of
poems
came
instead
they
floated
down
through
the
dark
as
she
lay
on
her
back
in
her
hard
narrow
bed
out
of
doors
her
feet
muffled
in
wet
moor
grass
went
to
a
beat
a
clang
she
would
never
play
well
at
any
minute
her
father
voice
or
her
mother
eyes
would
stiffen
her
fingers
and
stop
them
she
knew
what
she
would
do
she
had
always
known
she
would
make
poems
they
could
hear
you
making
poems
they
could
see
your
thoughts
falling
into
sound
patterns
only
part
of
the
pattern
would
appear
at
once
while
the
rest
of
it
went
on
sounding
from
somewhere
a
long
way
off
when
all
the
parts
came
together
the
poem
was
made
you
felt
as
if
you
had
made
it
long
ago
and
had
forgotten
it
and
remembered

the
room
held
her
close
cold
and
white
a

you
counted

was
shaped
like

at

end
of
each
arm
a
kitchen
lamp
with
a
tin
reflector
on
a
table
stood
in
the
breast
of
the
cross
its
flame
was
so
small
that
she
had
to
turn
it
on
to
her
work

she
had
the
conceited
exciting
thought

the
funeral
song
for
bion
moschus
was
bion
friend
she
wondered
whether
he
had
been
happy
or
unhappy
making
his
funeral
song
if
you
could
translate
it
all
if
you
could
only
make

could

like

to

curved
her

leaned
from

gave
a
skip
and
went
out

grieving
perhaps
suddenly
she
thought
of
maurice
jourdain
she
saw
him
standing
in
the
field
path
she
heard
him
say
talk
to
i
alive
i
here
i
listen
i
never
misunderstand
she
saw
his
worn
eyelids
his
narrow
yellowish
teeth
supposing
he
was
dead
she
would
forget
about
him
for
months
together
then
suddenly
she
would
remember
him
like
that
being
happy
and
excited
made
you
remember
she
tried
not
to
see
his
eyelids
and
his
teeth
they
did
matter
iv
the
season
of
ungovernable
laughter
had
begun
roddy
they
hear
us
we
i
not
i
blowing
my
nose
i
wish
could
make
it
sound
like
that
they
stood
on
the

doorstep
in
the
dark
under
the
snow

the

swept
ready
for
the

said
their
poor
party
it
would
be
awful
of
us
roddy
rang
as
they
waited
they
began
to
laugh
again
helpless
ruinous
agonising
laughter
oh
oh
i
can
hear

coming
something
you
might
be
unbuckling
my
the

waiting
for

sulky
and
superior
in

corner
as

came
in
everybody
but
norman
waugh
turned
round
and
stared
at
him
with
sudden
happy
smiles
he
was
so
beautiful
that
it
made
people
happy
to
look
at
him
his
very

sounded
more
beautiful
than

looked
at

grave
considering
look
as
if
he
knew
something
about
him
that
rodney
did
know

she

sutcliffe
said
he
had
come
in
late
without
his
wife
she
was
going
to
play
to
them
they
always
asked
you
to
play
she
thought
it
be
all
right
they
wo
listen
they
go
on
talking
i
play
something
so
soft
and
slow
that
they
wo
hear
it
i
shall
be
alone
listening
to
myself
she
played
the
first
movement
of
the
moonlight
sonata
a
beating
heart
a
grieving
voice
beautiful
quiet
grief
it
could
disturb
them
suddenly
they
all
left
off
talking
they
were
listening
each
note
sounded
pure
and
sweet
as
if
it
went
out
into
an
empty
room
they
came
close
up
one
by
one
on
tiptoe
with
slight
creakings
and
rustlings
miss
kendal
louisa
wright
dorsy
heron
their
eyes
were
soft
and
quiet
like
the
music
sutcliffe
sat
where
he
could
see
her
he
was
far
away
from
the
place
where
she
heard
herself
playing
but
she
could
feel
his
face
turned
on
her
like
a
light
the
first
movement
died
on
its
two
chords
somebody
was
saying
how
beautifully
she
plays
life
and
warmth
flowed
into
her
exquisite
tingling
life
and
warmth
go
on
go
on
sutcliffe
voice
sounded
miles
away
beyond
the
music
she
went
on
into
the
lovely
she
could
see
their
hushed
faces
leaning
nearer
you
could
make
them
happy
by
playing
to
them
they
loved
you
because
you
made
them
happy
sutcliffe
had
got
up
he
had
come
closer
she
was
playing
the
it
flowed
smoothly
under
her
fingers
at
an
incredible
pace
with
an
incredible
certainty
something
seemed
to
be
happening
over
there
outside
the
place
where
she
heard
the
music
martha
came
in
and
whispered
to
the
doctor
the
doctor
whispered
to
roddy
roddy
started
up
and
they
went
out
together
she
thought
papa
again
but
she
was
too
happy
to
care
nothing
mattered
so
long
as
she
could
listen
to
herself
playing
the
moonlight
sonata
under
the
music
she
was
aware
of
miss
kendal
stooping
over
her
pressing
her
shoulder
saying
something
she
stood
up
everybody
was
standing
up
looking
frightened
outside
in
the
hall
she
saw
catty
crying
she
went
past
her
over
the
open
threshold
where
the
snow
lay
like
a
light
she
could
stay
to
find
her
and
her
coat
the
track
across
the
green
struck
hard
and
cold
under
her
slippers
the
tickling
and
trickling
of
the
snow
felt
like
the
play
of
cold
light
fingers
on
her
skin
her
fear
was
a
body
inside
her
body
it
ached
and
dragged
stone
cold
and
still
vi
the
basin
kept
on
slipping
from
the
bed
she
could
see
its
pattern
reddish
flowers
and
green
leaves
and
curlykews
under
the
splashings
of
mustard
and
water
she
felt
as
if
it
must
slip
from
her
fingers
and
be
broken
when
she
pressed
it
tighter
to
the
edge
of
the
mattress
the
rim
struck
against
papa
breast
he
lay
stretched
out
on
the
big
yellow
birchwood
bed
the
curtains
were
drawn
back
holding
the
sour
smell
of
sickness
in
their
fluted
folds
papa
body
made
an
enormous
mound
under
the
green
eiderdown
it
move
a
little
fluff
of
down
that
had
pricked
its
way
through
the
cover
still
lay
where
it
had
settled
papa
head
still
lay
where
it
had
dropped
the
forefinger
still
pointed
at
the
fluff
of
down
papa
head
was
thrown
stiffly
back
on
the
high
pillows
it
sank
in
weighted
with
the
blood
that
flushed
his
face
around
it
on
the
white
linen
there
was
a
spatter
and
splash
of
mustard
and
water
his
beard
clung
to
his
chin
soaked
in
the
yellowish
stain
he
breathed
with
a
loud
grating
and
groaning
noise
her
ears
were
so
tired
with
listening
to
this
noise
that
sometimes
they
would
go
to
sleep
for
a
minute
or
two
then
it
would
wake
them
suddenly
and
she
would
begin
to
cry
again
you
could
stop
crying
if
you
looked
steadily
at
the
little
fluff
of
down
at
each
groaning
breath
it
quivered
and
sank
and
quivered
roddy
sat
by
the
he
stared
now
at
his
clenched
hands
now
at
his
face
in
the
glass
as
if
he
hated
it
as
if
he
hated
himself
mamma
was
still
dressed
she
had
got
up
on
the
bed
beside
papa
and
crouched
on
the
bolster
she
had
left
off
crying
every
now
and
then
she
stroked
his
hair
with
tender
desperate
fingers
it
struck
out
between
the
white
ears
of
the
in
a
thin
pointed
crest
papa
hair
his
poor
hair
these
alterations
of
the
familiar
person
the
flush
the
wet
clinging
beard
the
pointed
hair
stirred
in
her
a
rising
hysteria
of
pity
mamma
had
given
him
the
mustard
and
water
she
could
see
the
dregs
in
the
tumbler
on
the
and
the
brown
hen
feather
they
had
tickled
his
throat
with
they
ought
to
have
done
it
charles
would
not
have
let
them
do
it
if
he
had
been
there
they
should
have
waited
they
might
have
known
the
choking
and
the
retching
would
kill
him
catty
ought
to
have
known
somewhere
behind
his
eyes
his
life
was
leaking
away
through
the
torn
net
of
the
blood
vessels
bleeding
away
over
his
brain
under
his
hair
under
the
tender
desperate
fingers
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
pattern
of
the
a
purplish
in
a
white
oval
on
a
lavender
ground
she
clung
to
it
as
to
some
firm
safe
centre
of
being
vii
the
first
day
the
first
evening
she
went
on
hushed
feet
down
the
passage
to
let
dan
in
the
squeak
of
the
latch
picked
at
her
taut
nerves
she
was
glad
of
the
cold
air
that
rushed
into
the
soundless
house
the
sweet
cold
air
that
hung
about
dan
face
and
tingled
in
the
curling
frieze
of
his
overcoat
she
took
him
into
the
lighted
where
roddy
and
mamma
waited
for
him
the
callous
fire
crackled
and
spurted
brightness
the
table
was
set
for
dan
supper
dan
knew
that
papa
was
dead
he
betrayed
his
knowledge
by
the
cramped
stare
of
his
heavy
gentle
eyes
and
by
the
shamed
furtive
movements
of
his
hands
towards
the
fire
but
that
was
all
his
senses
were
still
uncontaminated
by
knowledge
he
had
not
seen
papa
he
had
not
heard
him
what
was
it
apoplexy
his
eyes
widened
innocent
vague
eyes
that
did
see
their
minds
fastened
on
dan
to
get
immunity
for
themselves
out
of
his
unconsciousness
as
long
as
they
could
keep
him
downstairs
in
his
innocence
their
misery
receded
from
them
a
little
way
but
mamma
would
not
have
it
so
she
looked
at
dan
her
eyes
were
dull
and
had
no
more
thought
in
them
her
mouth
quivered
they
knew
that
she
was
going
to
say
something
their
thread
of
safety
tightened
in
another
minute
it
would
snap
would
you
like
to
see
him
she
said
they
waited
for
dan
to
come
down
from
the
room
he
would
not
be
the
same
dan
he
would
have
seen
the
white
sheet
raised
by
the
high
mound
of
the
body
and
by
the
stiff
upturned
feet
and
he
would
have
lifted
the
handkerchief
from
the
face
he
would
be
like
them
and
his
consciousness
would
put
a
sharper
edge
on
theirs
he
would
be
afraid
to
look
at
them
as
they
were
afraid
to
look
at
each
other
because
of
what
he
had
seen
viii
she
lay
beside
her
mother
in
the
strange
spare
room
she
had
got
into
bed
straight
from
her
undressing
on
the
other
side
of
the
mattress
she
had
seen
her
mother
kneeling
body
like
a
dwarfed
thing
trailed
there
from
the
floor
and
her
hands
propped
up
on
the
edge
of
the
eiderdown
against
the
red
and
yellow
pattern
and
her
darling
bird
head
bowed
to
her
the
wet
eyelids
had
lifted
and
the
drowned
eyes
had
come
to
life
again
in
a
brief
glance
of
horror
mamma
had
expected
her
to
kneel
down
and
pray
in
bed
they
had
turned
their
backs
on
each
other
and
she
had
the
feeling
that
her
mother
shrank
from
her
as
from
somebody
unclean
who
had
omitted
to
wash
herself
with
prayer
she
wanted
to
take
her
mother
in
her
arms
and
hold
her
tight
but
she
could
she
could
suddenly
her
throat
began
to
jerk
with
a
hysterical
spasm
she
thought
i
wish
i
had
died
instead
of
papa
she
forced
back
the
jerk
of
her
hysteria
and
lay
still
listening
to
her
mother
sad
obstructed
breathing
and
her
soft
secret
blowing
of
her
nose
presently
these
sounds
became
a
meaningless
rhythm
and
ceased
she
was
a
child
dreaming
she
stood
on
the
nursery
staircase
at
five
elms
the
coffin
came
round
the
turn
and
crushed
her
against
the
banisters
only
this
time
she
was
not
afraid
of
it
she
made
herself
wake
because
of
something
that
would
happen
next
the
flagstones
of
the
passage
were
hard
and
cold
to
her
naked
feet
that
was
how
you
could
tell
you
were
awake
the
door
of
the
morfe
opened
into
mamma
old
bedroom
at
five
elms
and
when
she
came
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
she
saw
her
father
standing
there
he
looked
at
her
with
a
mocking
ironic
animosity
so
that
she
knew
he
was
alive
she
thought
it
all
right
i
only
dreamed
he
was
dead
i
shall
tell
mamma
when
she
really
woke
two
entities
two
different
and
discordant
memories
came
together
with
a
shock
her
mother
was
up
and
dressed
she
leaned
over
her
tucking
the
blankets
round
her
shoulders
and
saying
lie
still
and
go
to
sleep
again
a
good
girl
her
memory
cleared
and
settled
filtering
as
the
light
filtered
through
the
drawn
blinds
mamma
and
she
had
slept
together
because
papa
was
dead
ix
mary
do
you
know
why
you
crying
roddy
face
was
fixed
in
a
look
of
anger
and
resentment
and
of
anxiety
as
if
he
were
afraid
that
at
any
minute
he
would
be
asked
to
do
something
that
he
could
do
they
had
come
down
together
from
the
locked
room
and
gone
into
the
where
the
yellow
blinds
let
in
the
same
repulsive
greyish
ochreish
light
her
tears
did
not
fall
they
covered
her
eyes
each
with
a
shaking
lens
the
chairs
and
tables
floated
up
to
her
as
if
she
stood
in
an
aquarium
of
thick
greyish
ochreish
light
you
think
it
because
you
care
he
said
but
it
because
you
care
you
not
as
bad
as
i
am
i
do
care
a
bit
yes
you
do
or
you
would
think
you
did
no
none
of
us
really
cares
except
mamma
and
even
she
does
as
much
as
she
thinks
she
does
if
we
cared
we
be
glad
to
sit
in
there
doing
nothing
thinking
about
him
that
why
we
keep
on
going
upstairs
to
look
at
him
to
make
ourselves
feel
as
if
we
cared
she
wondered
was
that
really
why
they
did
it
she
thought
it
was
because
they
could
bear
to
leave
him
there
four
days
and
four
nights
alone
she
said
so
but
roddy
went
on
in
his
hard
flat
voice
beating
out
his
truth
we
never
did
anything
to
make
him
happy
he
happy
she
said
when
mark
went
he
had
mamma
yes
but
he
must
have
known
about
us
he
must
have
known
about
us
all
the
time
what
did
he
know
about
us
that
we
did
care
do
you
remember
he
said
the
things
we
used
to
say
about
him
she
remembered
she
could
see
dan
in
the
nursery
at
five
elms
scowling
and
swearing
he
would
kill
papa
she
could
see
roddy
and
mark
with
his
red
tight
face
laughing
at
him
she
could
see
herself
a
baby
kicking
and
screaming
when
he
took
her
in
his
arms
for
months
she
had
thought
about
him
except
to
wish
he
was
there
so
that
she
could
go
on
playing
when
he
was
in
the
fit
she
had
been
playing
on
the
kendals
piano
conceited
and
happy
not
caring
supposing
all
the
time
deep
down
in
his
secret
mysterious
life
had
cared
we
must
leave
off
thinking
about
him
roddy
said
if
we
keep
on
thinking
we
shall
go
off
our
heads
we
off
our
heads
she
said
their
hatred
of
themselves
was
a
biting
aching
madness
she
hated
the
conceited
happy
self
that
had
cared
the
piano
gleaming
sombrely
in
the
hushed
light
reminded
her
of
it
she
hated
the
piano
they
dragged
themselves
back
into
the
where
mamma
and
dan
sat
doing
nothing
hiding
their
faces
from
each
other
the
afternoon
went
on
utter
callousness
utter
weariness
came
over
them
their
mother
kept
looking
at
the
clock
uncle
victor
will
have
got
to
durlingham
she
said
an
hour
ago
she
had
said
uncle
victor
will
have
got
to
york
their
minds
clung
to
uncle
victor
as
they
had
clung
four
days
ago
to
dan
because
of
his
unconsciousness
x
uncle
victor
had
put
his
arm
on
her
shoulder
he
was
leaning
rather
heavily
he
saw
what
she
saw
the
immense
coffin
set
up
on
trestles
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
the
sheeted
body
packed
tight
in
the
padded
white
lining
the
hands
curling
a
little
smooth
and
stiff
the
hands
of
a
wax
figure
the
firm
sallowish
white
face
the
brown
stains
like
iodine
about
the
nostrils
the
pale
under
lip
pushed
out
proudly
a
cold
thick
smell
like
earth
damped
with
stagnant
water
came
up
to
them
mixed
with
the
sharp
piercing
smell
of
the
coffin
the
vigilant
upright
leaned
with
its
sloping
shoulders
against
the
ready
in
spite
of
his
heavy
hand
she
was
aware
that
uncle
consciousness
of
these
things
was
different
from
hers
he
did
not
appear
to
be
in
the
least
sorry
for
papa
on
his
face
wistful
absorbed
there
was
a
faint
incongruous
smile
he
might
have
been
watching
a
child
playing
some
mysterious
game
he
sighed
his
eyes
turned
from
the
coffin
to
the
he
stared
at
the
black
letters
on
the
shining
brass
plate
emilius
olivier
born
november
died
january
the
grip
on
her
shoulder
tightened
he
was
faithful
mary
he
said
it
as
if
he
were
telling
her
something
she
could
possibly
have
known
xi
the
funeral
woke
her
a
line
of
light
slid
through
the
chink
of
the
door
crooked
itself
and
staggered
across
the
ceiling
a
blond
triangle
throwing
the
shadows
askew
that
was
catty
carrying
the
lamp
for
the
bearers
it
came
again
there
was
a
shuffling
of
feet
in
the
passage
a
secret
muttering
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
the
crack
of
a
banister
a
thud
as
the
shoulder
of
the
coffin
butted
against
the
wall
at
the
turn
then
the
grinding
scream
of
the
brakes
on
the
hill
the
long
of
the
checked
wheels
ploughing
through
the
snow
she
could
see
her
mother
face
on
the
pillow
glimmering
with
shut
eyes
at
each
sound
she
could
hear
her
draw
a
shaking
sobbing
breath
she
turned
to
her
and
took
her
in
her
arms
the
small
stiff
body
yielded
to
her
helpless
like
a
child
oh
mary
what
shall
i
do
to
send
him
away
like
that
in
a
train
all
the
way
your
grandmamma
olivier
tried
to
keep
him
from
me
and
now
he
gone
back
to
her
you
got
mark
what
that
you
say
mark
mark
nobody
can
keep
mark
from
you
he
never
want
anybody
but
you
he
said
so
how
small
she
was
you
could
feel
her
little
weak
and
fine
under
your
fingers
like
a
child
you
could
break
them
to
be
happy
with
her
either
you
or
she
had
to
be
broken
to
be
helpless
and
little
like
a
child
it
was
a
sort
of
happiness
to
lie
there
holding
her
hiding
her
from
the
dreadful
funeral
dawn
five
the
funeral
would
last
till
three
going
along
the
road
to
reyburn
station
going
in
the
train
from
reyburn
to
durlingham
from
durlingham
to
king
cross
she
wondered
whether
dan
and
roddy
would
keep
on
feeling
the
funeral
all
the
time
the
train
was
part
of
it
not
the
worst
part
not
so
bad
as
going
through
the
east
end
to
the
city
of
london
cemetery
when
it
came
to
the
city
of
london
cemetery
her
mind
stopped
with
a
jerk
and
refused
to
follow
the
funeral
any
further
ten
eleven
they
had
shut
themselves
up
in
the
in
the
light
mamma
sat
in
her
tired
and
patient
holding
her
bible
and
her
church
service
on
her
knees
ready
every
now
and
then
she
dozed
when
this
happened
mary
took
the
bible
from
her
and
read
where
it
opened
and
he
made
the
candlestick
of
pure
gold
of
beaten
work
made
he
the
candlestick
his
shaft
and
his
branch
his
bowls
his
knops
and
his
flowers
were
of
the
same
and
in
the
candlestick
were
four
bowls
made
like
almonds
his
knops
and
his
flowers
and
a
knop
under
two
branches
of
the
same
and
a
knop
under
two
branches
of
the
same
and
a
knop
under
two
branches
of
the
same
according
to
the
six
branches
going
out
of
it
their
knops
and
their
branches
were
of
the
same
all
of
it
was
one
beaten
work
of
pure
gold
at
two
the
bell
of
renton
church
began
to
toll
her
mother
sat
up
in
a
stiff
attitude
and
opened
the
church
service
the
bell
went
on
tolling
for
papa
it
stopped
her
mother
was
saying
something
mary
i
ca
see
with
the
blind
down
do
you
think
you
could
read
it
to
me
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
a
queer
jarring
voice
burst
out
violently
in
the
dark
quiet
of
the
room
it
carried
each
sentence
with
a
rush
making
itself
steady
and
hard
he
that
believeth
in
me
though
he
were
dead
yet
shall
he
live
said
i
will
take
heed
to
my
ways
that
i
offend
not
with
my
tongue
not
that
one
her
mother
said
lord
thou
hast
been
our
refuge
from
one
generation
to
another
the
mountains
were
brought
forth
or
ever
the
earth
and
the
world
were
made
too
fast
much
too
fast
you
were
supposed
to
be
following
propart
but
if
you
kept
up
that
pace
you
would
have
finished
the
service
before
he
had
got
through
the
psalm
god
most
holy
i
ca
you
mary
i
sorry
lord
most
mighty
o
holy
and
most
merciful
saviour
deliver
us
not
into
the
bitter
pains
of
eternal
death
knowest
lord
the
secrets
of
our
hearts
shut
not
thy
merciful
ears
to
our
prayers
but
spare
us
lord
most
holy
o
god
most
mighty
o
holy
and
merciful
saviour
prayers
abject
prayers
for
themselves
none
for
him
not
one
word
they
were
cowards
afraid
for
themselves
afraid
of
death
their
funk
had
made
them
forget
him
it
was
as
if
they
did
believe
that
he
was
there
and
after
all
it
was
funeral
us
not
at
our
last
hour
the
hard
voice
staggered
and
dropped
picked
itself
and
continued
on
a
note
of
defiance
for
on
pains
of
death
to
fall
from
thee
they
would
have
come
to
the
grave
now
by
the
black
pointed
cypresses
there
would
be
a
long
pit
of
yellow
clay
instead
of
the
green
grass
and
the
white
curb
dan
and
roddy
would
be
standing
by
it
as
it
hath
pleased
almighty
god
of
his
mercy
to
take
unto
himself
the
soul
of
our
dear
brother
the
queer
violent
voice
stopped
i
ca
i
ca
mamma
seemed
gratified
by
her
inability
to
finish
the
order
for
the
burial
of
the
dead
xii
you
can
say
with
your
poor
father
lying
in
this
grave
it
was
the
third
evening
after
the
funeral
a
minute
ago
they
were
at
perfect
peace
and
now
the
everlasting
dispute
about
religion
had
begun
again
there
had
been
no
prayers
since
papa
died
because
mamma
trust
herself
to
read
them
without
breaking
down
at
the
same
time
it
was
inconceivable
to
her
that
there
should
be
no
prayers
i
should
have
thought
if
you
could
read
the
burial
service
i
only
did
it
because
you
asked
me
to
then
you
might
do
this
because
i
ask
you
it
is
the
same
thing
you
have
got
to
believe
in
the
burial
service
but
either
you
believe
in
prayers
or
you
do
believe
in
them
if
you
do
you
ought
to
read
them
you
ought
to
be
asked
to
read
them
how
are
we
going
on
i
should
like
to
know
supposing
i
was
to
be
laid
aside
are
there
to
be
no
prayers
ever
in
this
house
because
you
set
yourself
up
in
your
silly
against
the
truth
the
truth
the
truth
about
god
as
if
anybody
really
knew
it
as
if
it
mattered
as
if
anything
mattered
except
mamma
yet
it
did
matter
it
mattered
more
than
anything
in
the
whole
world
the
truth
about
god
the
truth
about
anything
just
the
truth
papa
death
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
it
was
fair
of
mamma
to
talk
as
if
it
had
to
bring
it
up
against
you
like
that
let
go
to
bed
she
said
her
mother
took
no
notice
of
the
suggestion
she
sat
bolt
upright
in
her
chair
her
face
had
lost
its
look
of
bored
weary
patience
it
flushed
and
flickered
with
resentment
i
shall
send
for
aunt
bella
she
said
why
aunt
bella
because
i
must
have
someone
someone
of
my
own
xiii
it
was
three
weeks
now
since
the
funeral
mamma
and
aunt
bella
sat
in
the
one
on
each
side
of
the
fireplace
mamma
looked
strange
and
sunken
and
rather
yellow
in
a
cap
and
a
black
knitted
shawl
but
aunt
bella
had
turned
herself
into
a
large
comfortable
sheep
by
means
of
a
fleece
of
white
shawl
and
an
hood
peaked
over
her
cap
there
was
a
sweet
inky
smell
of
black
things
dyed
at
pullar
mary
picked
out
the
white
threads
and
pretended
to
listen
while
aunt
bella
talked
to
mamma
in
a
woolly
voice
about
aunt
lavvy
friendship
with
the
unitarian
minister
and
uncle
edward
lumbago
and
the
unreasonableness
of
the
working
classes
she
thought
how
clever
it
was
of
aunt
bella
to
be
able
to
keep
it
up
like
that
i
could
do
it
to
save
my
life
as
long
as
i
live
i
shall
never
be
any
good
to
mamma
the
looked
like
metcalfe
the
undertaker
funereal
hypocrisy
she
wondered
whether
roddy
would
see
the
likeness
she
thought
of
roddy
nervous
laugh
when
catty
brought
in
the
first
yorkshire
cakes
his
eyes
had
stared
at
her
steadily
as
he
bit
into
his
piece
they
had
said
you
do
care
you
do
care
if
you
really
cared
you
could
eat
there
were
no
more
threads
to
pick
she
wondered
whether
she
would
be
thought
unfeeling
if
she
were
to
take
a
book
and
read
aunt
bella
began
to
talk
about
roddy
uncle
edward
said
roddy
ought
to
go
away
and
get
something
to
do
if
roddy
went
away
there
would
be
no
one
no
one
she
got
up
suddenly
and
left
them
xiv
the
air
of
the
braced
her
like
the
rigour
of
a
cold
bath
her
heartache
loosened
and
lost
itself
in
the
long
shiver
of
chilled
flesh
the
stone
walls
were
clammy
with
the
sweat
of
the
thaw
they
gave
out
a
sour
sickly
smell
grey
smears
of
damp
dulled
the
polished
lid
of
the
piano
they
had
used
the
since
papa
died
it
was
so
bright
so
heartlessly
cheerful
compared
with
the
other
rooms
you
could
see
that
mamma
would
think
you
unfeeling
if
you
wanted
to
sit
in
it
when
papa
was
dead
she
had
told
catty
not
to
light
the
fire
and
to
keep
the
door
shut
for
fear
you
should
be
tempted
to
sit
in
it
and
forget
the
piano
under
the
lid
the
keys
were
stiffening
with
the
damp
the
hammers
were
swelling
sticking
together
she
tried
not
to
think
of
the
piano
she
turned
her
back
on
it
and
stood
by
the
side
window
that
looked
out
on
to
the
garden
mamma
garden
it
mouldered
between
the
high
walls
blackened
by
the
thaw
on
the
the
snow
had
sunk
to
a
thin
crust
the
earth
was
a
black
ooze
through
ulcers
of
grey
snow
she
had
a
sudden
terrifying
sense
of
desolation
her
mind
clutched
at
this
feeling
and
referred
it
to
her
father
it
sent
out
towards
him
wherever
he
might
be
a
convulsive
emotional
cry
you
were
wrong
i
do
care
ca
you
see
that
i
can
never
be
happy
again
yet
if
you
could
come
back
i
would
be
happy
i
would
mind
your
your
little
funny
ways
it
was
true
she
mind
them
if
he
were
really
there
he
would
know
it
was
true
she
turned
and
looked
again
at
the
piano
she
went
to
it
she
opened
the
lid
and
sat
down
before
it
her
fingers
crept
along
the
keyboard
they
flickered
over
the
notes
of
the
sonata
a
ghostly
furtive
playing
without
pressure
without
sound
and
she
was
ashamed
as
if
the
piano
were
tempting
her
to
some
cruel
abominable
sin
xxii
i
the
consultation
had
lasted
more
than
an
hour
from
the
cobbled
square
outside
you
could
see
them
through
the
window
mamma
uncle
edward
uncle
victor
and
farmer
alderson
sitting
round
the
table
and
talking
talking
talking
about
roddy
it
was
awful
to
think
that
things
things
that
concerned
you
could
go
on
and
be
settled
over
your
head
without
your
knowing
anything
about
it
she
only
knew
that
papa
had
made
uncle
victor
and
uncle
edward
the
trustees
and
guardians
of
his
children
who
should
be
under
age
at
his
death
she
and
roddy
were
under
age
and
that
mamma
had
put
the
idea
of
farming
in
canada
into
uncle
edward
head
and
that
uncle
victor
had
said
he
would
hear
of
letting
roddy
go
out
by
himself
and
that
the
landlord
of
the
buck
hotel
had
told
victor
that
farmer
alderson
brother
ben
had
a
big
farm
somewhere
near
montreal
and
young
jem
alderson
was
going
out
to
him
in
march
and
they
might
come
to
some
arrangement
they
were
coming
to
it
now
roddy
and
she
crouching
beside
each
other
on
the
hearthrug
in
the
waited
till
it
should
be
over
through
the
shut
doors
they
could
still
distinguish
uncle
edward
smooth
fat
voice
from
uncle
victor
thin
one
the
booming
and
baying
were
the
noises
made
by
farmer
alderson
i
ca
think
what
they
want
to
drag
in
for
roddy
said
only
make
it
more
unpleasant
for
them
roddy
eyes
had
lost
their
fear
they
were
fixed
in
a
wise
mournful
stare
he
stared
at
his
fate
they
do
know
yet
quite
imbecile
i
am
if
i
could
have
gone
out
quietly
by
myself
they
never
need
have
known
now
they
to
alderson
tell
them
he
tell
everybody
i
do
care
it
their
own
they
soon
see
i
was
right
listen
she
said
the
door
had
opened
uncle
edward
voice
came
out
first
sounding
with
a
sort
of
complacent
finality
they
must
have
settled
it
you
could
hear
farmer
alderson
stumping
his
way
to
the
front
door
his
voice
boomed
from
the
step
ah
doa
saay
look
ye
mak
mooch
out
of
en
t
farst
damn
him
you
can
hear
his
beastly
voice
all
over
the
place
ef
yore

and

roddy
laughed
could
have
told
them
that
he
said
money
rather
they
ca
do
it
under
two
hundred
pounds
i
suppose
stump
up
as
usual
poor
victor
victor
wo
mind
he
do
anything
for
mamma
they
can
call
it
a
premium
if
it
makes
them
any
happier
but
it
simply
means
that
paying
alderson
to
get
rid
of
me
no
they
got
it
into
their
heads
that
it
bad
for
you
sticking
here
doing
nothing
so
it
is
but
being
made
to
do
what
i
ca
do
worse
i
not
likely
to
do
it
any
better
with
that
young
beast
alderson
looking
at
me
all
the
time
and
thinking
what
a
bloody
fool
i
am
they
ought
to
have
left
it
to
me
it
would
have
come
a
lot
cheaper
i
was
going
anyhow
i
only
stayed
because
of
papa
but
i
ca
tell
that
after
all
i
was
the
only
one
who
looked
after
him
if
i
gone
you
have
had
to
yes
it
would
even
come
cheaper
he
said
if
i
stayed
i
can
prove
it
he
produced
his
pocket
the
leaves
were
scribbled
over
with
sums
sums
desperately
begun
and
left
unfinished
sums
that
were
not
quite
sure
of
themselves
sums
scratched
out
and
begun
again
he
crossed
them
all
out
and
started
on
a
fresh
page
premium
two
hundred
passage
twenty
outfit
say
thirty
two
hundred
and
fifty
land
cheap
lumber
cheap
labour
expensive
still
alderson
would
be
so
pleased
he
might
do
the
job
himself
for
a
nominal
sum
and
only
charge
you
for
the
wood
funeral
expenses
say
ten
dollars
how
much
does
it
cost
to
keep
me
here
i
have
an
idea
no
but
think
i
ca
think
well
say
i
eat
ten
shillings
worth
of
food
per
week
that
pounds
a
year
say
thirty
clothes
five
sundries
perhaps
five
forty
but
i
do
the
garden
what
a
gardener
wages
twenty
fifteen
say
fifteen
fifteen
from
forty
fifteen
from
forty
how
much
did
papa
funeral
come
to
oh
roddy
i
do
know
say
thirty
from
two
hundred
and
fifty
two
hundred
and
deduct
funeral
one
hundred
and
there
you
are
one
hundred
and
pounds
for
carting
me
to
canada
if
you
feel
like
that
about
it
you
ought
to
tell
them
they
ca
make
you
go
if
you
do
want
to
they
not
making
me
go
i
going
i
could
possibly
stay
after
the
beastly
things
they
said
what
sort
of
things
about
my
keep
and
my
being
no
good
and
making
work
in
the
house
they
did
they
could
edward
did
he
said
if
it
was
for
me
mamma
would
have
to
have
maggie
catty
could
do
all
the
work
and
when
victor
sat
on
him
and
said
mamma
was
to
have
maggie
whatever
happened
he
jawed
back
and
said
she
could
afford
both
maggie
and
me
catty
could
do
maggie
work
and
i
could
do
catty
if
you
stop
it
would
be
only
cleaning
things
that
nothing
i
rather
clean
the
whole
house
and
you
you
would
you
only
think
you
would
i
would
really
i
tell
them
it
no
use
he
said
they
wo
let
you
i
make
them
i
go
and
tell
edward
and
victor
now
she
had
shot
up
from
the
floor
with
sudden
energy
and
stood
looking
down
at
roddy
as
he
still
crouched
there
her
heart
ached
for
him
he
want
to
go
to
canada
he
wanted
to
stay
with
mamma
and
mamma
was
driving
him
away
from
her
for
no
reason
except
that
uncle
edward
said
he
ought
to
go
she
could
hear
the
door
open
and
shut
again
they
were
coming
roddy
rose
from
the
floor
he
drew
himself
up
stretching
out
his
arms
in
a
crucified
attitude
and
grinned
at
her
do
you
suppose
he
said
i
let
you
he
grinned
at
uncle
edward
and
uncle
victor
as
they
came
in
uncle
victor
she
said
why
should
roddy
go
away
if
it
maggie
we
do
really
want
her
i
do
catty
work
and
he
do
the
garden
so
he
can
stay
ca
he
he
mary
but
i
do
think
he
will
of
course
i
wo
if
you
had
waited
to
mix
me
up
with
alderson
i
could
have
cleared
out
and
got
there
by
this
time
you
do
suppose
i
was
going
to
sponge
on
my
mother
for
ever
do
you
he
stood
there
defying
uncle
edward
and
uncle
victor
defying
their
thoughts
of
him
she
wondered
whether
he
had
forgotten
the
two
hundred
pounds
and
whether
they
were
thinking
of
it
they
did
answer
and
roddy
after
fixing
on
them
a
look
they
could
meet
strode
out
of
the
room
she
thought
how
like
mark
he
is
with
his
tight
squared
shoulders
holding
his
head
high
his
hair
was
like
mark
hair
golden
brown
close
clipped
to
the
nape
of
his
neck
when
he
had
gone
it
would
be
like
going
it
better
he
should
go
uncle
victor
said
for
his
own
sake
uncle
edward
said
of
course
it
is
his
little
blue
eyes
glanced
up
from
the
side
of
his
nose
twinkling
his
mouth
stretched
from
white
whisker
to
white
whisker
in
a
smile
of
righteous
benevolence
but
uncle
victor
eyes
slunk
away
as
if
he
were
ashamed
of
himself
it
was
uncle
victor
who
had
paid
the
two
hundred
pounds
ii
supposing
there
something
the
matter
with
him
will
he
still
have
to
go
i
do
see
why
you
should
suppose
there
anything
the
matter
with
him
her
mother
said
is
it
likely
your
uncle
victor
would
be
paying
all
that
money
to
send
him
out
if
he
was
fit
to
go
it
did
seem
likely
that
victor
would
have
done
anything
of
the
sort
any
more
than
uncle
edward
would
have
let
aunt
bella
give
him
an
overcoat
lined
with
black
jennet
they
were
waiting
for
roddy
to
come
back
from
the
doctor
before
uncle
victor
left
morfe
he
had
made
roddy
promise
that
for
mamma
satisfaction
he
would
go
and
be
overhauled
and
it
was
as
if
he
had
said
you
see
then
how
much
need
there
is
to
worry
you
might
have
kept
on
hoping
that
something
would
happen
to
prevent
roddy
going
but
for
the
size
and
solidity
and
expensiveness
of
the
preparations
you
might
forget
that
his
passage
was
booked
for
the
first
saturday
in
march
that
was
the
first
wednesday
that
victor
two
hundred
pounds
had
been
paid
to
jem
alderson
account
at
the
bank
in
montreal
and
still
the
black
jennet
lining
of
the
overcoat
shouted
at
you
that
nothing
stop
roddy
going
now
uncle
victor
might
be
reckless
but
uncle
edward
and
aunt
bella
took
no
risks
unless
after
all
kendal
stopped
it
if
he
said
roddy
must
go
she
could
hear
roddy
feet
coming
back
they
sounded
like
mark
feet
on
the
flagged
path
outside
he
came
into
the
room
quickly
his
eyes
shone
he
looked
pleased
and
excited
mamma
stirred
in
her
chair
that
a
bright
face
we
need
ask
if
you
got
your
passport
she
said
he
looked
at
her
a
light
unresting
look
how
right
you
are
he
said
and
wise
well
i
did
suppose
there
was
much
the
matter
with
you
there
is
he
went
to
the
bookshelf
where
he
kept
his
i
would
sit
down
and
draw
if
i
were
you
there
is
time
there
be
less
after
saturday
he
sat
down
and
began
to
draw
he
was
as
absorbed
and
happy
as
if
none
of
them
had
ever
heard
of
canada
he
chanted
to
right
of
them
cannon
to
left
of
them
cannon
in
front
of
them
volleyed
and
thundered
the
pencil
moved
excitedly
volumes
of
smoke
curled
and
rolled
and
writhed
on
the
side
of
the
sheet
the
guns
of
balaclava
the
jaws
of
death
into
the
mouth
of
hell
rode
the
six
hundred
a
rush
of
hoofs
and
heads
and
lifted
blades
on
the
right
hand
the
horses
and
swords
of
the
light
brigade
not
to
make
reply
theirs
not
to
reason
why
theirs
but
to
do
and
die
you
ought
to
be
a
soldier
roddy
like
mark
not
a
farmer
oh
wise
oh
right
the
light
brigade
was
there
a
man
dismayed
not
though
the
soldier
knew
someone
had
blundered
iii
she
was
going
up
the
schoolhouse
lane
towards
karva
because
roddy
and
she
had
gone
that
way
together
on
friday
his
last
evening
it
was
sunday
now
six
the
time
he
used
to
bring
papa
home
his
ship
would
have
left
queenstown
it
would
be
steering
to
the
west
she
wondered
how
much
he
had
really
minded
going
perhaps
he
had
only
been
afraid
he
would
be
strong
enough
for
after
he
had
seen
the
doctor
he
had
been
different
pleased
and
excited
perhaps
he
mind
so
very
much
if
she
could
only
remember
how
he
had
looked
and
what
he
had
said
he
had
talked
about
the
big
atlantic
liner
and
the
canadian
forests
with
luck
the
voyage
might
last
eleven
or
twelve
clear
days
you
could
shoot
moose
and
wapiti
wapiti
and
elk
elk
with
his
eyes
shining
he
was
not
quite
sure
about
the
elk
he
wished
he
had
written
to
the
high
commissioner
for
canada
about
the
elk
that
was
what
the
commissioner
was
there
for
to
answer
questions
to
encourage
you
to
go
to
his
beastly
country
she
could
hear
roddy
voice
saying
these
things
as
they
walked
over
karva
he
was
turning
it
all
into
an
adventure
his
imagination
playing
round
and
round
it
and
on
saturday
morning
he
had
been
sick
and
eat
his
breakfast
mamma
had
been
sorry
and
at
the
same
time
vexed
and
irritable
as
if
she
were
afraid
that
the
arrangements
might
after
all
be
upset
but
in
the
end
he
had
gone
off
pleased
and
excited
with
jem
alderson
in
the
train
she
could
see
jem
wide
shoulders
pushing
through
the
carriage
door
after
roddy
he
had
a
gentle
reddish
face
and
long
hanging
moustaches
like
a
dying
gladiator
little
eyes
that
screwed
up
to
look
at
you
he
would
be
good
to
roddy
it
would
be
all
right
she
stood
still
in
the
dark
lane
a
disturbing
memory
gnawed
its
way
through
her
thoughts
that
covered
it
the
way
roddy
had
looked
at
mamma
that
wednesday
the
way
he
had
spoken
to
her
oh
wise
oh
right
that
was
because
he
believed
she
wanted
him
to
go
away
he
believe
that
she
really
cared
for
him
that
mamma
really
cared
for
anybody
but
mark
he
could
believe
that
anybody
cared
for
him
the
jaws
of
death
into
the
mouth
of
hell
rode
the
six
hundred
roddy
chant
pursued
her
up
the
lane
the
gate
at
the
top
fell
to
behind
her
moor
grass
showed
grey
among
black
heather
she
half
saw
half
felt
her
way
along
the
sheep
tracks
there
where
the
edge
of
the
round
pit
broke
away
was
the
place
where
roddy
had
stopped
suddenly
in
front
of
her
i
would
mind
a
bit
if
i
had
been
such
a
brute
to
little
mamma
why
we
such
brutes
to
her
he
had
turned
in
the
narrow
and
faced
her
with
his
question
why
the
light
brigade
was
there
a
man
dismayed
not
though
the
soldier
knew
someone
had
blundered
hunderd
blundered
did
tennyson
really
call
hundred
hunderd
the
grey
curve
of
the
high
road
glimmered
alongside
the
moor
from
the
point
where
her
track
joined
it
she
could
see
three
lights
two
moving
one
still
the
still
light
at
the
turn
came
from
the
aldersons
house
the
moving
lights
went
with
the
of
hoofs
on
the
road
down
in
the
darkness
beyond
the
fields
garthdale
lay
like
a
ditch
under
the
immense
wall
of
greffington
edge
roddy
hated
greffington
edge
he
hated
morfe
he
to
get
away
it
would
be
all
right
the
sounded
close
behind
her
two
shafts
of
light
shot
out
in
front
white
on
the
grey
road
kendal
drove
past
in
his
he
leaned
out
over
the
side
peering
she
heard
him
say
something
to
himself
the
wheels
slowed
down
with
a
grating
noise
the
lights
stood
still
he
had
pulled
up
he
was
waiting
for
her
she
turned
suddenly
and
went
back
up
the
moor
by
the
way
she
had
come
she
did
want
to
see
kendal
she
was
afraid
he
would
say
something
about
roddy
xxiii
i
the
books
stood
piled
on
the
table
by
her
window
the
books
miss
wray
of
clevehead
had
procured
for
her
had
given
and
lent
her
now
roddy
had
gone
she
had
time
enough
to
read
them
hume
the
fat
maroon
schwegler
the
two
volumes
of
kant
in
the
paper
covers
der
reinen
vernunft
kritik
der
reinen
she
said
it
over
and
over
to
herself
it
sounded
nicer
than
critique
of
pure
at
the
sight
of
the
thick
black
letters
on
the
ground
her
heart
jumped
up
and
down
with
excitement
lucky
it
was
in
german
so
that
mamma
could
find
out
what
kant
was
driving
at
the
secret
was
hidden
behind
the
thick
black
bars
of
the
letters
in
schwegler
as
you
went
on
you
went
deeper
you
saw
thought
folding
and
unfolding
thought
moving
on
and
on
thought
drawing
the
universe
to
itself
pushing
the
universe
away
from
itself
to
draw
it
back
again
closer
than
close
space
and
time
were
forms
of
thought
they
were
infinite
so
thought
was
infinite
it
went
on
and
on
for
ever
carrying
space
carrying
time
if
only
you
knew
what
the
was
ii
mamma
the
letter
lay
between
them
on
the
hall
table
by
the
study
door
her
mother
put
her
hand
over
it
quick
a
black
m
showed
between
her
forefinger
and
her
thumb
they
looked
at
each
other
and
her
mother
mouth
began
to
pout
and
smile
as
it
used
to
when
papa
said
something
improper
she
took
the
letter
and
went
with
soft
feet
and
swinging
haunches
like
a
cat
carrying
a
mouse
into
the
study
mary
stared
at
the
shut
door
maurice
jourdain
maurice
jourdain
what
on
earth
was
he
writing
to
mamma
for
five
minutes
ago
she
had
been
quiet
and
happy
reading
kant
of
pure
now
her
heart
beat
like
a
hammer
staggering
with
its
own
blows
the
blood
raced
in
her
brain
iii
mamma
if
you
do
tell
me
i
shall
write
and
ask
him
her
mother
looked
up
frightened
you
would
do
that
mary
oh
would
i
though
i
do
it
like
a
shot
she
wondered
why
she
had
thought
of
it
an
hour
ago
well
if
there
no
other
way
to
stop
you
her
mother
gave
her
the
letter
picking
it
up
by
one
corner
as
though
it
had
been
a
dirty
it
show
you
she
said
the
sort
of
man
he
is
mary
held
the
letter
in
both
her
hands
gently
her
heart
beat
gently
now
with
a
quiet
feeling
of
happiness
and
satisfaction
she
looked
a
long
time
at
the
characters
the
m
the
close
sharp
v
the
t
crossed
with
a
savage
downward
stab
she
was
quiet
as
long
as
she
only
looked
when
she
read
the
blood
in
her
brain
raced
faster
and
confused
her
she
stopped
at
the
bottom
of
the
first
page
i
ca
think
what
he
means
it
pretty
plain
what
he
means
her
mother
said
about
all
those
letters
what
letters
letters
he
been
writing
to
your
father
and
me
and
your
uncle
victor
when
ever
since
you
left
school
you
were
sent
to
school
to
keep
you
out
of
his
way
and
you
were
back
before
he
began
his
persecuting
if
you
want
to
know
why
we
left
ilford
why
he
persecuted
your
poor
father
he
persecuted
your
uncle
victor
and
now
he
persecuting
me
persecuting
what
is
it
but
persecuting
threatening
that
he
wo
answer
for
the
consequences
if
he
does
get
what
he
wants
he
mistaken
if
he
thinks
that
the
way
to
get
it
what
he
want
i
suppose
her
mother
said
he
thinks
he
wants
to
marry
you
me
he
does
say
that
he
only
says
he
wants
to
come
and
see
me
why
should
he
because
your
father
did
wish
it
and
your
uncle
and
i
do
wish
it
you
do
like
him
do
i
love
him
nonsense
you
do
know
what
you
talking
about
you
have
forgotten
all
about
him
if
you
had
seen
that
letter
i
thought
he
forgotten
me
you
ought
to
have
told
me
it
was
cruel
not
to
tell
me
he
must
have
loved
me
all
the
time
he
said
i
was
to
wait
three
years
and
i
did
know
what
he
meant
he
must
have
loved
me
then
and
i
did
know
it
the
sound
of
her
voice
surprised
her
it
came
from
her
whole
body
it
vibrated
like
a
violin
how
could
he
love
you
you
were
a
child
then
i
not
a
child
now
you
have
to
let
him
marry
me
i
rather
see
you
in
your
coffin
i
rather
see
you
married
to
poor
norman
waugh
and
goodness
knows
i
would
like
that
your
mother
did
like
your
marrying
papa
you
surely
do
compare
maurice
jourdain
with
your
father
he
faithful
papa
was
faithful
i
faithful
too
faithful
to
a
horrid
man
like
that
he
is
horrid
he
kind
and
clever
and
good
he
brave
like
mark
he
have
been
a
soldier
if
he
had
had
to
help
his
mother
and
honourable
he
said
he
would
see
me
or
write
to
me
unless
you
let
him
and
he
has
seen
me
and
he
has
written
you
ca
say
he
honourable
i
suppose
her
mother
said
he
honourable
enough
you
have
to
let
him
come
if
you
do
i
go
to
i
declare
if
you
not
as
bad
as
your
aunt
charlotte
iv
incredible
impossible
but
it
had
happened
and
it
was
as
if
she
had
known
it
all
the
time
known
that
she
would
come
downstairs
that
morning
and
see
maurice
jourdain
letter
lying
on
the
table
she
always
had
known
that
something
some
wonderful
beautiful
tremendous
thing
would
happen
to
her
this
was
it
it
had
been
hidden
in
all
her
happiness
her
happiness
was
it
maurice
jourdain
when
she
said
maurice
jourdain
she
could
feel
her
voice
throb
in
her
body
like
the
string
of
a
violin
when
she
thought
of
maurice
jourdain
the
stir
renewed
itself
in
a
vague
exquisite
vibration
the
edges
of
her
mouth
curled
out
with
faint
throbbing
movements
suddenly
sensitive
like
eyelids
like
odd
memories
darted
out
at
her
the
plantation
at
ilford
jimmy
mouth
crushing
her
face
jimmy
arms
crushing
her
chest
a
scarlet
frock
the
white
by
the
ford
bertha
mitchison
saying
things
things
you
would
think
of
if
you
could
help
it
but
she
was
mainly
aware
of
a
surpassing
tenderness
and
a
desire
to
immolate
herself
in
some
remarkable
and
noble
fashion
for
maurice
jourdain
if
only
she
could
see
him
for
ten
minutes
five
minutes
and
tell
him
that
she
forgotten
him
he
belonged
to
her
real
life
her
self
had
a
secret
place
where
people
could
get
at
it
where
its
real
life
went
on
he
was
the
only
person
she
could
think
of
as
having
a
real
life
at
all
like
her
own
she
had
thought
of
him
as
mixed
up
for
ever
with
her
real
life
so
that
whether
she
saw
him
or
not
whether
she
remembered
him
or
not
he
would
be
there
he
was
in
the
songs
she
made
he
was
in
the
sonata
he
was
in
the
solemn
beauty
of
karva
under
the
moon
in
the
of
pure
she
caught
the
bright
passing
of
his
mind
perhaps
she
had
forgotten
a
little
what
he
looked
like
smoky
black
eyes
tired
eyelids
a
crystal
mind
shining
and
flashing
a
mind
like
a
big
room
filled
from
end
to
end
with
light
maurice
jourdain
i
do
think
i
should
have
known
you
mary
maurice
jourdain
had
come
in
the
end
uncle
victor
had
let
him
he
was
sitting
there
all
by
himself
on
the
sofa
in
the
middle
of
the
room
it
was
his
third
evening
she
had
thought
it
was
going
to
pass
exactly
like
the
other
two
and
then
her
mother
had
got
up
with
an
incredible
suddenness
and
left
them
through
the
open
window
you
could
hear
the
rain
falling
in
the
garden
you
could
see
the
garden
grey
and
wet
with
rain
she
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
fender
and
without
looking
up
she
knew
that
he
was
watching
her
from
under
eyelids
his
eyelids
were
so
old
so
tired
so
very
tired
and
old
what
did
you
cut
it
all
off
for
oh
just
for
fun
without
looking
at
him
she
knew
that
he
had
moved
that
his
chin
had
dropped
to
his
chest
there
would
be
a
sort
of
puffiness
in
his
cheeks
and
about
his
jaw
under
the
black
beard
when
she
saw
it
she
felt
a
little
creeping
chill
at
her
heart
but
that
was
unfaithfulness
that
was
cruelty
if
he
knew
it
poor
thing
how
it
would
hurt
him
but
he
never
would
know
she
would
behave
as
though
she
had
seen
any
difference
in
him
at
all
if
only
she
could
set
his
mind
moving
turn
the
crystal
about
make
it
flash
and
shine
what
have
they
been
doing
to
you
he
said
you
used
to
be
clever
i
wonder
if
you
clever
still
i
do
think
i
am
very
she
thought
i
stupid
i
as
stupid
as
an
owl
i
never
felt
so
stupid
in
all
my
life
if
only
i
could
of
something
to
say
to
him
did
they
tell
you
what
i
come
for
yes
are
you
glad
very
glad
why
do
you
sit
on
the
fender
i
cold
cold
and
glad
a
long
pause
do
you
know
why
your
mother
hates
me
mary
she
does
she
only
thought
you
killed
papa
i
did
kill
him
it
was
my
fault
if
he
could
control
his
temper
that
is
what
she
hates
me
for
do
you
know
why
you
were
sent
to
school
the
school
my
aunt
found
for
you
well
to
keep
me
from
seeing
you
yes
and
because
i
asked
your
father
to
let
me
educate
you
since
he
was
doing
it
himself
i
wanted
to
send
you
to
a
school
in
paris
for
two
years
i
did
know
they
never
told
me
what
made
you
want
to
do
all
that
for
me
it
was
for
you
it
was
for
the
little
girl
who
used
to
go
for
walks
with
me
she
was
the
nicest
little
girl
she
said
the
jolliest
things
in
the
dearest
little
voice
can
a
man
like
care
to
talk
to
a
child
like
did
i
say
that
i
do
remember
said
it
it
sounds
rather
silly
of
her
she
was
silly
she
was
clever
as
they
make
them
and
she
was
pretty
too
she
had
lots
of
hair
hanging
down
her
back
curling
and
they
take
her
away
from
me
and
i
wait
three
years
for
her
she
knew
i
was
waiting
and
when
i
come
back
to
her
she
wo
look
at
me
she
sits
on
the
fender
and
stares
at
the
fire
she
wears
horrible
black
clothes
because
papa
dead
she
goes
and
cuts
her
hair
all
off
that
is
because
your
dead
it
grow
again
not
for
another
three
years
and
i
believe
i
hear
your
mother
coming
back
his
chin
dropped
to
his
chest
again
he
brooded
morosely
presently
catty
came
in
with
the
coffee
the
next
day
he
was
gone
vi
it
seems
to
me
her
mother
said
you
only
care
for
him
when
he
there
he
had
come
again
twice
in
july
in
august
each
time
her
mother
had
said
are
you
sure
you
want
him
to
come
again
you
know
you
were
very
happy
the
last
time
and
she
had
answered
i
know
i
going
to
be
this
time
you
see
she
said
when
he
there
you
remember
and
when
he
there
he
makes
you
forget
forget
what
what
it
used
to
feel
like
mamma
had
smiled
a
funny
contented
smile
mamma
was
different
her
face
had
left
off
being
reproachful
and
disapproving
it
had
got
back
the
tender
adorable
look
it
used
to
have
when
you
were
little
she
hated
maurice
jourdain
yet
you
felt
that
in
some
queer
way
she
loved
you
because
of
him
you
loved
her
more
because
of
maurice
jourdain
the
engagement
happened
suddenly
at
the
end
of
august
you
knew
it
would
happen
some
day
but
you
thought
of
it
as
happening
or
the
day
after
rather
than
at
three
you
started
for
a
walk
never
knowing
how
you
might
come
back
and
at
five
you
found
yourself
sitting
at
tea
in
the
orchard
safe
he
would
slouch
along
beside
you
for
miles
morosely
you
thought
of
his
mind
swinging
off
by
itself
shining
where
you
could
see
it
you
broke
loose
from
him
to
run
tearing
along
the
road
to
jump
to
climb
trees
and
grin
down
at
him
through
the
branches
then
he
would
wake
up
from
his
sulking
sometimes
he
would
be
pleased
and
sometimes
he
would
the
engagement
happened
just
after
he
had
not
been
pleased
at
all
she
could
still
hear
his
voice
saying
what
do
you
it
for
and
her
own
answering
you
must
do
you
need
dance
jigs
on
the
parapets
of
bridges
they
slid
through
the
gap
into
the
fields
in
the
narrow
path
he
stopped
suddenly
and
turned
how
can
a
child
like
care
for
a
man
like
mocking
her
he
stooped
and
kissed
her
she
shut
her
eyes
so
as
not
to
see
the
puffiness
will
you
marry
me
mary
vii
after
the
engagement
the
quarrel
it
lasted
all
the
way
up
the
schoolhouse
lane
i
care
for
you
i
do
really
you
do
know
what
you
talking
about
you
may
care
for
me
as
a
child
cares
you
do
care
as
a
woman
does
no
woman
who
cared
for
a
man
would
write
the
letters
you
do
i
ask
you
to
tell
me
about
yourself
what
you
feeling
and
thinking
and
you
send
me
some
ghastly
screed
about
spinoza
or
kant
do
you
suppose
any
man
wants
to
hear
what
his
sweetheart
thinks
about
space
and
time
and
the
you
used
to
like
it
i
do
like
it
now
no
woman
would
wear
those
horrible
clothes
if
she
cared
for
a
man
and
wanted
him
to
care
for
her
she
would
cut
her
hair
off
how
was
i
to
know
you
mind
so
awfully
and
how
do
you
know
what
women
do
or
do
do
has
it
never
occurred
to
you
that
i
might
know
more
women
than
you
know
men
that
i
might
have
women
friends
i
do
think
i
thought
about
it
very
much
have
you
men
do
live
to
be
without
getting
to
know
women
they
ca
go
about
the
world
without
meeting
them
there
a
little
girl
down
in
sussex
a
dear
little
girl
she
everything
a
man
wants
a
woman
to
be
lots
of
hair
lots
of
hair
stacks
of
it
and
she
clever
she
can
cook
and
sew
and
make
her
own
clothes
and
her
sisters
she
kept
her
father
house
since
she
was
fifteen
without
a
servant
how
awful
for
her
and
you
like
her
yes
mary
i
glad

her
who
else
a
frenchwoman
in
paris
and
a
german
woman
in
hamburg
and
an
englishwoman
in
london
the
cleverest
woman
i
know
she
unhappy
mary
her
husband
behaves
to
her
like
a
perfect
brute
poor
thing
i
hope

to
her
she
thinks
i
am
silence
he
peered
into
her
face
are
you
jealous
of
her
mary
i
not
jealous
of
any
of
them
you
can
marry
them
all
if
you
want
to
i
was
going
to
marry
one
of
them
then
why
did
you
because
the
little
girl
in
essex
would
let
me
little
beast
so
you
jealous
of
are
you
you
need
be
she
gone
she
tried
to
swallow
the
der
reinen
and
it
disagreed
with
her
and
she
died
einmal
doch
mächt
ich
dich
sehen
und
sinken
vor
dir
auf
knie
und
sterbend
zu
dir
sprechen
madam
ich
liebe
sie
what
that
oh
what
that
madam
is
heine
viii
my
dearest
maurice
it
was
her
turn
for
writing
she
wondered
whether
he
would
like
to
hear
about
the
tennis
party
at
the
vicarage
spencer
rollitt
nephew
harry
craven
had
been
there
and
the
two
acroyd
girls
from
renton
lodge
and
norman
waugh
harry
craven
fawn
face
with
pointed
chin
face
with
black
accents
small
fawn
mouth
lifting
upwards
narrow
nostrils
slanting
upwards
two
lobes
of
white
forehead
of
parted
hair
he
smiled
a
blunt
v
opening
suddenly
on
white
teeth
black
eyes
fluttering
he
laughed
all
his
features
made
sudden
upward
movements
like
raised
wings
the
acroyds
plump
girls
with
pink
blown
cheeks
and
sulky
mouths
you
thought
of
sullen
babies
of
trumpeting
cherubs
disgusted
with
their
trumpets
they
were
showing
their
racquets
to
harry
craven
bending
their
heads
you
could
see
the
backs
of
their
necks
fat
with
no
groove
in
the
nape
where
their
hair
curled
in
springy
wires
minna
dark
sophy
golden
they
turned
their
backs
when
you
spoke
and
pretended
not
to
hear
you
she
thought
she
would
like
maurice
to
know
that
harry
craven
and
she
had
beaten
minna
ackroyd
and
norman
waugh
a
love
set
afterwards
harry
craven
playing
in
the
dark
the
tennis
net
coiled
like
a
grey
snake
on
the
black
lawn
let
hide
together
harry
craven
hiding
crouching
beside
you
under
the
currant
bushes
the
scramble
together
up
the
and
along
the
scullery
roof
the
last
rush
across
the
lawn
i
say
you
run
like
the
wind
he
took
your
hand
you
ran
faster
and
faster
you
stood
together
under
the
ash
tree
panting
and
laughing
safe
he
still
held
your
hand
funny
that
you
should
remember
it
when
you
had
noticed
it
at
the
time
hands
were
funny
things
his
hand
had
felt
like
mark
hand
or
roddy
you
did
think
of
it
as
belonging
to
him
it
made
you
want
to
have
mark
and
roddy
back
again
to
play
with
them
perhaps
after
all
it
would
be
kind
to
tell
maurice
about
the
tennis
party
he
could
have
played
like
that
he
could
have
scrambled
up
the
and
run
with
you
along
the
scullery
roof
my
dearest
maurice
nothing
has
happened
since
you
left
except
that
there
was
a
tennis
party
at
the
vicarage
yesterday
you
know
what
tennis
parties
are
like
you
be
shocked
to
hear
that
i
wore
my
old
black
jersey
the
one
you
hated
so
ix
kind
wir
waren
kinder
she
shut
her
eyes
she
wanted
nothing
but
his
voice
his
voice
was
alive
it
remembered
it
had
grown
old
and
tired
my
child
we
once
were
children
two
children
happy
and
small
we
crept
in
the
little
and
hid
ourselves
under
the
straw
kikeriküh
sie
glaubten
es
wäre
hahnen
geschrei
it
all
very
well
mary
i
ca
go
on
reading
heine
to
you
for
ever
and
he
had
taken
her
on
his
knees
that
happened
sometimes
she
kept
one
foot
on
the
floor
so
as
not
to
press
on
him
with
her
whole
weight
and
she
played
with
his
watch
chain
she
liked
to
touch
the
things
he
wore
it
made
her
feel
that
she
cared
for
him
it
staved
off
the
creeping
sickening
fear
that
came
when
their
hands
and
faces
touched
do
you
know
he
said
what
it
will
be
like
afterwards
she
began
slowly
to
count
the
buttons
of
his
waistcoat
have
you
ever
tried
to
think
what
it
will
be
like
yes
last
night
lying
awake
in
the
dark
she
had
tried
to
think
she
had
thought
of
shoulders
heaving
over
her
of
arms
holding
her
of
a
face
looking
into
hers
a
beardless
face
blue
eyes
black
eyebrows
drawn
close
down
on
to
the
blue
jimmy
face
not
maurice
jourdain
that
was
in
september
october
passed
she
began
to
wonder
when
he
would
come
again
he
came
on
the
last
day
of
november
x
maurice
you
keeping
something
from
me
something
happened
something
made
you
unhappy
yes
something
made
me
unhappy
the
garthdale
road
before
them
on
the
rise
the
white
highway
showed
like
a
sickle
curving
into
the
moor
at
the
horn
of
the
sickle
a
tall
ash
tree
in
the
wall
of
the
aldersons
farm
where
the
road
dipped
they
turned
he
slouched
slowly
his
head
hung
forward
loosening
the
fold
of
flesh
about
his
jaw
his
eyes
blinked
in
the
soft
november
sunshine
his
eyelids
were
tight
as
though
they
had
been
tied
with
string
supposing
i
asked
you
to
release
me
from
our
engagement
for
always
perhaps
for
always
perhaps
only
for
a
short
time
till
i
settled
something
till
i
found
out
something
i
want
to
know
would
you
mary
of
course
i
would
like
a
shot
and
supposing
i
never
settled
it
that
would
be
all
right
i
can
go
on
being
engaged
to
you
but
you
need
be
engaged
to
me
you
dear
little
thing
i
afraid
i
afraid
that
would
do
it
would
do
beautifully
unless
you
really
keeping
something
back
from
me
i
am
keeping
something
back
from
you
i
no
right
to
worry
you
with
my
unpleasant
affairs
i
was
fairly
well
off
when
i
asked
you
to
marry
me
but
the
fact
is
it
looks
as
if
my
business
was
going
to
bits
i
may
be
able
to
pull
it
together
again
i
may
not
is
all
i
glad
you
told
me
if
you
told
me
before
it
would
have
saved
a
lot
of
bother
what
sort
of
bother
well
you
see
i
was
quite
sure
whether
i
really
wanted
to
marry
you
just
yet
sometimes
i
thought
i
did
sometimes
i
thought
i
did
and
now
i
know
i
do
that
it
i
may
not
be
in
a
position
to
marry
you
i
ca
ask
you
to
share
my
poverty
i
sha
mind
that
i
used
to
it
i
may
not
be
able
to
keep
a
wife
at
all
of
course
you
will
you
keeping
a
housekeeper
now
and
a
cook
and
a
housemaid
i
may
have
to
send
two
of
them
away
send
them
all
away
i
work
for
you
all
my
life
i
shall
never
want
to
do
anything
else
it
what
i
always
wanted
when
i
was
a
child
i
used
to
imagine
myself
doing
it
for
you
it
was
a
sort
of
game
i
played
it
a
sort
of
game
you
playing
now
my
poor
mary
no
no
it
wo
do
what
do
you
think
i
made
of
no
woman
who
cared
for
a
man
could
give
him
up
for
a
thing
like
that
there
are
other
things
complications
i
think
i
better
write
to
your
mother
or
your
brother
write
to
them
write
to
them
they
wo
care
a
rap
about
your
business
we
not
like
that
maurice
xi
you
better
let
me
see
what
he
says
mamma
her
mother
had
called
to
her
to
come
into
the
study
she
had
maurice
jourdain
letter
in
her
hand
she
looked
sad
and
at
the
same
time
happy
my
darling
he
does
want
you
to
see
it
is
it
as
bad
as
all
that
yes
if
i
had
my
way
you
should
never
have
had
anything
to
do
with
him
i
have
forbidden
him
the
house
if
your
uncle
victor
had
said
that
was
the
way
to
make
you
mad
about
him
he
seemed
to
think
that
seeing
him
would
cure
you
and
so
it
ought
to
have
done
he
says
you
know
he
wants
to
break
off
the
engagement
but
he
think
he
has
made
you
understand
why
oh
yes
he
did
it
because
of
his
business
he
does
say
a
word
about
his
business
i
to
break
it
to
you
that
he
does
care
for
you
as
he
thought
he
cared
as
if
he
was
old
enough
to
know
what
he
wanted
he
might
have
made
up
his
mind
before
he
drove
your
father
into
his
grave
tell
me
what
he
says
he
just
says
that
he
says
he
in
an
awful
position
and
whatever
he
does
he
must
behave
dishonourably
i
admit
he
sorry
enough
and
doing
the
only
honourable
thing
he
do
that
she
fixed
her
mind
on
his
honour
you
could
love
that
you
could
love
that
always
he
he
asked
you
to
release
him
did
he
yes
then
why
on
earth
did
you
i
did
but
i
could
release
myself
but
that
what
you
ought
to
have
done
instead
of
leaving
him
to
do
it
oh
no
that
would
have
been
dishonourable
to
myself
you
rather
be
jilted
much
rather
it
more
honourable
to
be
jilted
than
to
jilt
that
not
the
world
idea
of
honour
it
my
idea
of
it
and
after
all
he
maurice

xii
the
pain
hung
on
to
the
left
side
of
her
head
clawing
when
she
left
off
reading
she
could
feel
it
beat
like
a
hammer
driving
in
a
warm
nail
aunt
lavvy
sat
on
the
parrot
chair
with
her
feet
on
the
fender
her
fingers
had
left
off
embroidering
brown
birds
on
drab
linen
in
the
dying
light
of
the
room
things
showed
fuzzy
headachy
outlines
it
made
you
feel
sick
to
look
at
them
mamma
had
left
her
alone
with
aunt
lavvy
i
suppose
you
think
that
nobody
was
ever
so
unhappy
as
you
are
aunt
lavvy
said
i
hope
nobody
is
i
hope
nobody
ever
will
be
should
you
say
was
unhappy
you
do
look
it
i
hope
you
not
years
ago
i
was
miserable
because
i
could
have
my
own
way
i
could
marry
the
man
i
cared
for
oh
why
did
you
my
mother
and
your
father
and
your
uncle
victor
would
let
me
i
suppose
he
was
a
unitarian

was
a
unitarian
but

he
been
i
could
have
married
him
i
could
do
anything
i
liked
i
could
go
where
i
liked
or
stay
where
i
liked
i
wanted
to
be
a
teacher
but
i
had
to
give
it
up
because
your
uncle
victor
and
i
had
to
look
after
your
aunt
charlotte
you
could
have
got
somebody
else
to
look
after
aunt
charlotte
somebody
else

look
after
her
now
your
grandmamma
made
us
promise
never
to
send
her
away
as
long
as
it
was
possible
to
keep
her
that
why
your
uncle
victor

all
the
time
aunt
charlotte

have
been

any
case

he
love
anybody
yes

he
loved
your

lamp
aunt
lavvy
went
out
quickly
mary
got
up
and
stretched
herself
the
pain
had
left
off
hammering
she
could
think
aunt
lavvy
to
live
like
that
for
years
and
to
be
happy
at
the
end
she
wondered
what
happiness
there
could
be
in
that
dull
surrender
and
acquiescence
that
cold
meek
love
of
god

the

little

flaxen
gentleman
carrying
himself
with
an
air
of
pompous
levity
eyes
slewing
round
as
you
passed
and
belk
hard
tight
rotundity
little
eyes
twinkling
busily
in
a
snub
face
with
a
bilious
gleam
curious
eyes
busy
eyes
saying
i
like
to
know
what
she
did
to
be
jilted
minna
and
sophy
acroyd
with
their
blown
faces
and
small
disgusted
mouths
you
could
see
them
look
at
each
other
they
were
saying
that
awful
girl
again
they
were
glad
you
were
jilted
spencer
rollitt
looked
at
you
with
his
hard
blue
eyes
his
mouth
closed
tight
with
a
snap
when
he
saw
you
coming
he
had
disapproved
of
you
ever
since
you
played
in
his
garden
with
his
nephew
he
thought
it
served
you
right
to
be
jilted
and
there
was
charles
kind
look
under
his
savage
shaggy
eyebrows
and
miss
kendal
squeeze
of
your
hand
when
you
left
her
and
the
sudden
start
in
dorsy
heron
black
hare
eyes
they
were
sorry
for
you
because
you
had
been
jilted
miss
louisa
wright
was
sorry
for
you
she
would
ask
you
to
tea
in
her
little
she
lived
in
the
ivy
house
next
door
to
waugh
the
piano
would
be
open
the
yellow
keys
shining
from
the
white
title
page
enormous
black
letters
would
call
to
you
across
the
room
cleansing
fires
that
was
the
song
she
sang
when
she
was
thinking
about
charles
first
you
played
for
her
the
moonlight
sonata
and
then
she
sang
for
you
with
a
feverish
exaltation
for
as
gold
is
refined
in
the
so
a
heart
is
tried
by
pain
she
sang
it
to
comfort
you
her
head
quivered
slightly
as
she
shook
the
notes
out
of
her
throat
in
ecstasy
she
was
sorry
for
you
but
she
was
like
aunt
lavvy
she
thought
it
was
a
good
thing
to
be
jilted
for
then
you
were
purified
your
soul
was
set
free
it
went
up
writhing
and
aspiring
in
a
white
flame
to
god
ii
mary
why
are
you
always
admiring
yourself
in
the
glass
i
not
admiring
myself
i
only
wanted
to
see
if
i
was
than
last
time
why
are
you
worrying
about
it
you
never
used
to
because
i
used
to
think
i
was
pretty
her
mother
smiled
you
were
pretty
and
took
back
her
smile
you
be
pretty
always
if
you
were
happy
and
you
be
happy
if
you
were
good
there
no
happiness
for
any
of
us
without
christ
she
ignored
the
dexterous
application
do
you
mean
i
not
then
really
so
very
ugly
nobody
said
you
were
ugly
maurice
jourdain
did
you
do
mean
to
say
you
still
thinking
of
that
man
not
thinking
exactly
only
wondering
wondering
what
it
was
he
hated
so
you
would
wonder
if
you
knew
the
sort
of
man
he
is
a
man
who
could
threaten
you
with
his
infidelity
he
never
threatened
me
i
suppose
it
was
me
he
threatened
then
what
did
he
say
he
said
that
if
his
wife
did
take
care
to
please
him
there
were
other
women
who
would
he
ought
to
have
said
that
to
me
it
was
horrible
of
him
to
say
it
to
you
she
did
know
why
she
felt
that
it
was
horrible
i
can
tell
you
thing
said
her
mother
as
if
she
had
not
told
her
anything
it
was
those
books
you
read
that
everlasting
philosophy
he
said
it
was
answerable
for
the
whole
thing
then
it
was
the
whole
he
hated
i
suppose
so
her
mother
said
dismissing
a
matter
of
small
interest
you
better
change
that
skirt
if
you
going
with
me
to
mrs
waugh
do
you
mind
if
i
go
for
a
walk
instead
not
if
it
makes
you
any
more
contented
it
might
are
you
sure
you
do
mind
oh
go
along
with
you
her
mother
was
pleased
she
was
always
pleased
when
she
scored
a
point
against
philosophy
iii
and
belk
were
coming
along
high
row
she
avoided
them
by
turning
down
the
narrow
passage
into
horn
yard
and
the
back
lane
from
the
back
lane
you
could
get
up
through
the
fields
to
the
lane
without
seeing
people
she
hated
seeing
them
they
all
thought
the
same
thing
that
you
wanted
maurice
jourdain
and
that
you
were
unhappy
because
you
had
got
him
they
thought
it
was
awful
of
you
mamma
thought
it
was
awful
like
like
aunt
charlotte
wanting
to
marry
the
or
poor
jenny
wanting
to
marry
spall
maurice
jourdain
knew
better
than
that
he
knew
you
did
want
to
marry
him
any
more
than
he
wanted
to
marry
you
he
nagged
at
you
about
your
hair
about
philosophy
she
could
hear
his
voice
now
as
she
went
up
the
lane
he
could
nag
worse
than
a
woman
but
he
knew
knew
as
far
as
she
could
see
through
the
working
of
his
dark
mind
first
he
had
cared
for
her
cared
violently
then
he
had
not
cared
that
would
be
because
he
cared
for
some
other
woman
there
were
two
of
them
the
girl
and
the
married
woman
she
felt
no
jealousy
and
no
interest
in
them
beyond
wondering
which
of
them
it
would
be
and
what
they
would
be
like
there
had
been
two
mary
oliviers
and
she
had
been
jealous
of
the
one
jealous
of
herself
there
had
been
two
maurice
jourdains
the
one
who
said
i
understand
i
never
lose
my
temper
the
one
with
the
crystal
mind
shining
and
flashing
the
mind
like
a
big
room
filled
from
end
to
end
with
light
but
he
had
never
existed
maurice
jourdain
was
only
a
name
a
name
for
intellectual
beauty
you
could
love
that
love
was
the
there
was
the
love
of
the
body
and
the
love
of
the
soul
perhaps
she
had
loved
maurice
jourdain
with
her
soul
and
not
with
her
body
no
she
had
loved
him
with
her
soul
either
body
and
soul
soul
and
body
spinoza
said
they
were
two
aspects
of
the
same
thing
thing
perhaps
it
was
silly
to
ask
what
thing
it
would
be
just
body
soul
somebody
talked
about
a
soul
dragging
a
corpse
her
body
was
a
corpse
it
was
strong
and
active
it
could
play
games
and
jump
it
could
pick
dan
up
and
carry
him
round
the
table
it
could
run
a
mile
straight
on
end
it
could
excite
itself
with
its
own
activity
and
strength
it
dragged
a
soul
dull
and
heavy
a
soul
that
would
never
be
excited
again
never
lift
itself
up
again
in
any
ecstasy
if
only
he
had
let
her
alone
if
only
she
could
go
back
to
her
real
life
but
she
could
she
could
feel
any
more
her
sudden
secret
happiness
maurice
jourdain
had
driven
it
away
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
maurice
jourdain
he
ought
not
to
have
been
able
to
take
it
from
you
she
might
go
up
to
karva
hill
to
look
for
it
but
it
would
not
be
there
she
could
even
remember
what
it
had
been
like
iv
new
year
night
she
was
lying
awake
in
her
white
cell
she
hated
maurice
jourdain
his
wearily
searching
eyes
made
her
restless
his
man
voice
made
her
restless
with
its
questions
do
you
know
what
it
will
be
like
afterwards
do
you
really
want
me
she
did
want
him
but
she
wanted
somebody
somebody
somebody
he
had
left
her
with
this
ungovernable
want
somebody
if
you
lay
very
still
and
shut
your
eyes
he
would
come
to
you
you
would
see
him
you
knew
what
he
was
like
he
had
jimmy
body
and
jimmy
face
and
mark
ways
he
had
the
soul
of
shelley
and
the
mind
of
spinoza
and
immanuel
kant
they
talked
to
each
other
her
reverie
ran
first
into
long
fascinating
conversations
about
space
and
time
and
the
and
the
transcendental
ego
he
could
tell
you
whether
you
were
right
or
wrong
whether
substance
and
the
were
the
same
thing
or
different
die
if
thou
wouldst
be
with
that
which
thou
dost
seek
he
wrote
that
he
wrote
all
shelley
poems
except
the
bad
ones
he
wrote
in
he
could
understand
your
wanting
to
know
what
the
was
if
by
dying
this
minute
you
could
know
what
it
was
you
would
be
glad
to
die
would
you
the
world
was
built
up
in
space
and
time
time
and
space
were
forms
of
thought
ways
of
thinking
if
there
was
thinking
there
would
be
a
thinker
supposing
supposing
the
transcendental
ego
was
the
that
was
idea
she
was
content
to
let
him
have
the
best
ones
you
could
keep
him
going
for
quite
a
long
time
that
way
before
you
got
tired
the
nicest
way
of
all
though
was
not
to
be
yourself
but
to
be
him
to
live
his
exciting
adventurous
dangerous
life
then
you
could
raise
an
army
and
free
ireland
from
the
english
and
armenia
from
the
turks
you
could
go
away
to
beautiful
golden
cities
melting
in
sunshine
you
could
sail
in
the
china
sea
you
could
get
into
central
africa
among
savage
people
with
queer
bloody
gods
you
could
find
out
all
sorts
of
things
you
were
he
and
at
the
same
time
you
were
yourself
going
about
with
him
you
loved
him
with
a
passionate
love
there
room
for
both
of
you
on
the
raft
you
sat
cramped
up
huddled
together
not
enough
hard
tack
while
he
was
sleeping
you
slipped
off
a
shark
got
you
it
had
a
face
like
charles
the
lunatic
was
running
after
him
like
mad
with
a
revolver
you
ran
like
mad
morfe
bridge
when
he
raised
his
arm
you
jerked
it
up
and
the
revolver
went
off
into
the
air
the
fire
was
between
his
bed
and
the
door
it
curled
and
broke
along
the
floor
like
surf
you
waded
through
it
you
picked
him
up
and
carried
him
out
as
sister
dora
carried
the
corpses
with
the
a
screw
loose
somewhere
a
tap
turned
on
your
mind
dribbled
imbecilities
she
kicked
i
wo

i
wo
think
about
it
any
more
restlessness
it
ached
it
gnawed
stopping
a
minute
beginning
again
only
to
be
appeased
by
reverie
by
the
running
tap
restlessness
that
was
desire
it
must
be
desire
imeros

there
was
the

in

there
was
swinburne
swift
and
subtle
and

as
a

before
thee
the
laughter
behind
thee
the
tears
of

there
was
the
song
minna
acroyd
sang
at
the
sutcliffes
party
and
sad
for
of
the
bee
how
could
anybody
sing
such
a
silly
song
through
the
wide
open
window
she
could
smell
the
frost
she
could
hear
it
tingle
she
put
up
her
mouth
above
the
bedclothes
and
drank
down
the
clear
cold
air
she
thought
with
pleasure
of
the
ice
in
her
bath
in
the
morning
it
would
break
under
her
feet
splintering
and
tinkling
like
glass
if
you
kept
on
thinking
about
it
you
would
sleep
passion
week
her
mother
was
reading
the
lessons
for
the
day
mary
waited
till
she
had
finished
mamma
what
was
the
matter
with
aunt
charlotte
i
sure
i
do
know
except
that
she
was
always
thinking
about
getting
married
whatever
put
aunt
charlotte
in
your
head
her
mother
looked
up
from
the
prayer
book
as
she
closed
it
sweet
and
pretty
sweet
and
pretty
young
almost
as
she
used
to
look
and
tranquil
it
my
belief
she
said
there
would
have
been
anything
the
matter
with
her
if
your
grandmamma
olivier
had
spoiled
her
charlotte
was
as
vain
as
a
little
peacock
and
your
grandmamma
was
always
petting
and
praising
her
and
letting
her
have
her
own
way
if
she
had
her
own
way
she
have
been
married
and
then
perhaps
she
would
have
gone
mad
she
might
have
gone
madder
said
her
mother
it
was
a
good
thing
for
you
my
dear
you
did
get
your
way
i
rather
have
seen
you
in
your
coffin
than
married
to
maurice
jourdain
whoever
it
had
been
you
have
said
that
perhaps
i
should
i
do
want
my
only
daughter
to
go
away
and
leave
me
it
would
be
different
if
there
were
six
or
seven
of
you
her
mother
complacence
and
tranquillity
annoyed
her
she
hated
her
mother
she
adored
her
and
hated
her
mamma
had
married
for
her
own
pleasure
for
her
passion
she
had
brought
you
into
the
world
without
asking
your
leave
for
her
own
pleasure
she
had
brought
you
into
the
world
to
be
unhappy
she
had
planned
for
you
to
do
the
things
that
she
did
she
cared
for
you
only
as
long
as
you
were
doing
them
when
you
left
off
and
did
other
things
she
left
off
caring
i
shall
never
go
away
and
leave
you
she
said
she
hated
her
mother
and
she
adored
her
an
hour
later
when
she
found
her
in
the
garden
kneeling
by
the
violet
bed
weeding
it
she
knelt
down
beside
her
and
weeded
too
vi
april
may
june
one
afternoon
before
her
mother
called
her
into
the
study
to
show
her
draper
letter
draper
wrote
about
dora
engagement
and
effie
wedding
dora
was
engaged
to
hubert
manisty
who
would
have
vinings
effie
had
broken
off
her
engagement
to
young
tom
manisty
she
was
married
last
week
to
the
banker
draper
thought
effie
had
been
very
wise
to
give
up
young
manisty
for
she
wrote
in
a
postscript
maurice
jourdain
has
just
called
to
ask
if
i
have
any
news
of
mary
i
think
he
would
like
to
know
that
that
wretched
affair
has
not
made
her
unhappy
mamma
was
smiling
in
a
nervous
way
what
am
i
to
say
to
mrs
draper
tell
her
that
jourdain
was
right
and
that
i
am
not
at
all
unhappy
she
was
glad
to
take
the
letter
to
the
post
and
set
his
mind
at
rest
it
was
in
june
last
year
that
maurice
jourdain
had
come
to
her
june
the
was
the
he
must
have
remembered
the
hayfields
shone
ready
for
mowing
under
the
wind
the
shimmering
hay
grass
moved
like
waves
of
hot
air
up
and
up
the
hill
she
slipped
through
the
gap
by
morfe
bridge
and
went
up
the
fields
to
the
road
on
greffington
edge
she
lay
down
among
the
bracken
in
the
place
where
roddy
and
she
had
sat
two
years
ago
when
they
had
met
sutcliffe
coming
down
the
road
the
bracken
hid
her

made
a

she
shut

and
hidden
himself
under
the
straw
he
would
never
have
crowed
like
a
cock
mark
and
roddy
would
and
harry
craven
and
jimmy
jimmy
would
certainly
have
hidden
himself
under
the
straw
supposing
jimmy
had
had
a
crystal
mind
shining
and
flashing
supposing
he
had
never
done
that
awful
thing
they
said
he
did
supposing
he
had
had
mark
ways
had
been
noble
and
honourable
like
mark
the
interminable
reverie
began
he
was
there
beside
her
in
the
bracken
she
did
know
what
his
name
would
be
it
could
be
jimmy
or
harry
or
any
of
those
names
not
mark
mark
name
was
sacred
cecil
perhaps
cecil
you
ape
you
drivelling
dribbling
idiot
that
was
the
sort
of
thing
aunt
charlotte
would
have
thought
of
she
got
up
with
a
jump
and
stretched
herself
she
would
have
to
run
if
she
was
to
be
home
in
time
for
tea
from
the
top
hayfield
she
could
see
the
sutcliffes
tennis
court
an
emerald
green
space
set
in
thick
grey
walls
she
drew
her
left
hand
slowly
down
her
right
forearm
the
muscle
was
hardening
and
thickening
mamma
did
like
it
when
you
went
by
yourself
to
play
singles
with
sutcliffe
but
if
sutcliffe
asked
you
you
would
simply
have
to
go
you
would
have
to
play
a
great
many
singles
against
sutcliffe
if
you
were
to
be
in
good
form
next
year
when
mark
came
home
vii
she
was
always
going
to
the
sutcliffes
now
her
mother
shook
her
head
when
she
saw
her
in
her
short
white
skirt
and
white
jersey
slashing
at
nothing
with
her
racquet
ready
mamma
did
like
the
sutcliffes
she
said
they
had
been
nice
to
poor
papa
they
had
never
asked
him
again
you
could
see
she
thought
you
a
beast
to
like
them
but
mamma
darling
i
ca
help
liking
them
and
mamma
would
look
disgusted
and
go
back
to
her
pansy
bed
and
dig
her
trowel
in
with
little
savage
thrusts
and
say
she
supposed
you
would
always
have
your
own
way
you
would
go
down
to
greffington
hall
and
find
sutcliffe
sitting
under
the
beech
tree
on
the
lawn
in
white
flannels
looking
rather
tired
and
bored
and
sutcliffe
a
beauty
of
victorian
albums
growing
stout
wearing
full
skirts
and
white
cashmere
shawls
and
wide
mushroomy
hats
when
nobody
else
did
she
had
an
air
of
doing
it
on
purpose
to
be
different
like
royalty
she
would
take
your
hand
and
press
it
gently
and
smile
her
downward
dragging
smile
and
she
would
say
how
is
your
mother
does
she
mind
the
hot
weather
she
must
come
and
see
me
when
it
cooler
that
was
the
nice
way
she
had
so
that
you
might
think
it
was
mamma
fault
or
papa
if
they
did
see
each
other
often
and
she
would
look
down
at
her
shawl
and
gather
it
about
her
as
if
in
spirit
she
had
got
up
and
gone
away
and
sutcliffe
would
be
standing
in
front
of
you
looking
suddenly
years
younger
with
his
eyes
shining
and
clean
as
though
he
had
just
washed
them
and
after
tea
you
would
play
singles
furiously
for
two
hours
you
would
try
to
beat
him
when
you
jumped
the
net
sutcliffe
would
wave
her
hand
and
nod
to
you
and
smile
you
had
done
something
that
pleased
her
when
it
was
all
over
sutcliffe
took
her
back
into
the
house
and
there
on
the
hall
table
were
the
books
he
had
got
for
her
from
the
london
library
the
heine
the
goethe
the
sappho
the
of
the
schopenhauer
welt
als
wille
und
five
all
at
once
i
get
fifteen
as
long
as
we
here
you
shall
have
your
five
he
walked
home
with
her
carrying
the
books
five
five
and
when
you
had
finished
them
there
would
be
five
more
it
was
unbelievable
why
are
you
so
nice
to
me
why
i
think
it
must
be
because
i
like
you
mary
utterly
unbelievable
do
you
like
me
i
liked
you
the
first
day
i
saw
you
with
your
brother
on
greffington
edge
i
wonder
why
she
wondered
what
he
was
thinking
what
deep
down
inside
him
he
was
really
thinking
perhaps
it
was
because
you
wanted
something
i
could
give
you
tennis
you
wanted
it
so
badly
everything
you
want
you
want
so
badly
and
i
never
knew
we
were
going
to
be
such
friends
no
more
did
i
and
i
do
know
now
how
long
it
going
to
last
why
should
it
last
because
next
year
will
have
come
home
and
you
have
nothing
to
say
to
me
mark
wo
make
a
scrap
of
difference
well
if
it
is
you
grow
up
mary
and
it
wo
amuse
you
to
talk
to
me
any
more
i
sha
know
you
you
wear
long
skirts
and
long
hair
done
in
the
fashion
i
shall
always
want
to
talk
to
you
i
shall
never
do
up
my
hair
i
cut
it
off
because
i
could
be
bothered
with
it
but
i
was
sold
i
thought
it
would
curl
all
over
my
head
and
it
did
curl
it
curls
at
the
tips
sutcliffe
said
i
like
it
makes
you
look
like
a
jolly
boy
instead
of
a
dreadful
unapproachable
young
lady
a
little
san
giovanni
a
little
san
giovanni
that
was
his
trick
caressing
his
own
words
as
if
he
liked
them
she
wondered
what
deep
down
inside
him
he
was
really
like
sutcliffe
if
you
known
a
girl
when
she
was
only
fourteen
and
you
liked
her
and
you
never
saw
her
again
till
she
was
seventeen
and
then
you
found
that
she
gone
and
cut
her
hair
all
off
would
it
give
you
an
awful
shock
depends
on
how
much
i
liked
her
if
you
liked
her
awfully
would
it
make
you
leave
off
liking
her
i
think
my
friendship
could
stand
the
strain
if
it
was
just
friendship
supposing
it
was
mrs
sutcliffe
i
should
like
my
wife
to
cut
her
hair
off
it
would
be
at
all
becoming
to
her
no
but
when
she
was
young
ah
when
she
was
young
would
it
have
made
any
difference
no
no
it
would
have
made
any
difference
at
all
you
have
married
her
just
the
same
just
the
same
mary
why
oh
nothing
i
thought
you
be
like
that
i
just
wanted
to
make
sure
he
smiled
to
himself
he
had
funny
secret
thoughts
that
you
would
never
know
well
she
said
i
did
beat
you
form
not
good
enough
yet
quite
he
promised
her
it
should
be
perfect
by
the
time
mark
came
home
viii
the
pale
evening
the
words
rushed
together
she
tell
whether
they
were
her
own
or
somebody
else
there
was
the
queer
shock
of
recognition
that
came
with
your
own
real
things
it
was
remembering
though
it
felt
like
it
shelley
the
pale
purple
even
not
was
what
you
saw
the
sky
to
the
east
after
sunset
above
greffington
edge
take
out
pale
and
evening
was
your
own
the
poem
was
coming
by
bits
at
a
time
she
could
feel
the
rest
throbbing
behind
it
an
unreleased
impatient
energy
her
mother
looked
in
at
the
door
what
are
you
doing
it
for
mary
oh
for
nothing
then
for
pity
sake
come
down
into
the
warm
room
and
do
it
there
you
catch
cold
she
hated
the
warm
room
the
poem
would
be
made
up
of
many
poems
it
would
last
a
long
time
through
the
winter
and
on
into
the
spring
as
long
as
it
lasted
she
would
be
happy
she
would
be
free
from
the
restlessness
and
the
endless
idiotic
reverie
of
desire
ix
from
all
blindness
of
heart
from
pride
and
hypocrisy
from
envy
hatred
and
malice
and
all
uncharitableness
lord
deliver
mary
was
kneeling
beside
her
mother
in
church
from
fornication
and
all
other
deadly
sin
happiness
the
happiness
that
came
from
writing
poems
happiness
that
other
people
could
have
that
you
could
give
to
them
happiness
that
was
no
good
to
mamma
no
good
to
anybody
but
you
secret
and
selfish
that
was
your
happiness
it
was
deadly
sin
she
felt
an
immense
intolerable
compassion
for
everybody
who
was
unhappy
a
litany
of
compassion
went
on
inside
her
for
old
kendal
sloughing
and
rotting
in
his
chair
for
miss
kendal
for
all
women
labouring
of
child
for
old
heron
for
dorsy
heron
for
all
prisoners
and
captives
for
miss
louisa
wright
for
all
that
were
desolate
and
oppressed
for
maggie
sister
dying
of
cancer
and
for
mamma
kneeling
there
praying
sunday
after
sunday
and
she
would
work
in
the
garden
every
morning
digging
in
leaf
mould
and
carrying
the
big
stones
for
the
rockery
she
would
go
to
sewing
parties
she
would
sit
for
hours
with
maggie
sister
trying
not
to
look
as
if
she
minded
the
smell
of
the
cancer
you
were
no
good
unless
you
could
do
little
things
like
that
you
were
no
good
unless
you
could
keep
on
doing
them
she
tried
to
keep
on
some
people
kept
on
all
day
all
their
lives
still
it
was
not
you
so
much
as
the
world
that
was
wrong
it
was
fair
and
right
that
sister
should
have
cancer
while
you
had
nothing
the
matter
with
you
or
even
that
maggie
had
to
cook
and
scrub
while
you
made
poems
not
fair
and
right
x
mamma
what
is
it
why
are
you
in
the
dark
by
the
firelight
she
could
see
her
mother
sitting
with
her
eyes
shut
and
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
i
ca
use
my
eyes
i
think
there
must
be
something
the
matter
with
them
your
eyes
do
they
hurt
you
might
have
known
you
might
have
known
that
something
would
happen
while
you
were
upstairs
writing
not
thinking
of
her
you
might
have
known
hurts
just
there
when
i
try
to
read
i
must
be
going
blind
are
you
sure
it
is
your
glasses
how
can
it
be
my
glasses
they
never
hurt
me
before
but
the
oculist
in
durlingham
said
it
her
glasses
she
was
going
blind
it
was
likely
that
she
ever
would
go
blind
for
a
week
before
the
new
glasses
came
mamma
sat
patient
and
gentle
in
her
chair
with
her
eyes
shut
and
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
and
you
read
aloud
to
her
the
bible
and
in
the
morning
and
dickens
in
the
afternoon
and
in
the
evening
you
played
draughts
and
mamma
beat
you
mamma
said
i
shall
be
quite
sorry
when
the
new
glasses
come
mary
was
sorry
too

had
been
so
happy
xi

last
of

queer
things
sometimes
though

may
think

the
only
one
that

afraid
of

queer
things

after
him
ordering
her
trousseau
and
dressing
herself

one
point

why

all
about
the
room
mamma
picked
up
the
stockings
and
went
away
you
could
see
that
she
was
annoyed
annoyed
with
uncle
victor
for
having
been
afraid
to
marry
a
dreadful
thought
came
to
her
does
mamma

or

of
she
felt
afraid
xxv
i
she
waited
mamma
and
mark
had
turned
their
backs
to
her
as
they
clung
together
but
there
was
his
hair
clipped
close
into
the
nape
of
his
neck
if
only
mamma
would
cry
like
that
mark
is
that
minky
they
held
each
other
and
let
go
in
one
tick
of
the
clock
but
she
had
stood
a
long
time
seeing
his
eyes
arrested
in
their
rush
of
recognition
disappointed
the
square
stretched
itself
into
an
immense
white
space
between
her
and
mark
it
made
itself
small
again
for
mark
and
mamma
across
the
white
space
she
heard
him
saying
things
about
dan
meeting
him
at
tilbury
and
poor
victor
coming
to
liverpool
street
and
cox
last
night
he
had
stayed
at
ilford

had
seen
bella
and
edward
and
pidgeon
and
fisher
and
the
proparts
do
you
remember
poor
edward
and
his
sheep
and
mary
lamb
mark
had
changed
except
that
he
was
firmer
and
squarer
and
thinner
because
he
had
had
fever
and
his
eyes
he
was
staring
at
her
with
his
disappointed
eyes
she
called
to
him
you
do
know
me
a
bit
mark
he
laughed
i
thought
i
see
somebody
grown
up
victor
said
mary
was
dreadfully
mature
what
did
he
mean
mamma
said
she
was
sure
she

too
old
much
older
than
he

mary
mamma
eyes
blinked
her
forehead
was
pinched
with
vexation
her
foot
tapped
on
the
floor
mark
eyes
kept
up
their
puzzled
stare
what
been
happening
he
said
what
the
matter
everywhere
i
go
there

mystery
there

a
mystery

mystery
about
some
people
called

a
mystery
about

in
disgrace
as
if
she

something

awfully
queer
mamma

only
person
something
has
happened
to
i

to
me
said
mamma
that
makes
it
queerer
mamma
went
up
with
mark
into
his
room
papa
room
you
could
hear
her
feet
going
up
and
down
in
it
and
the
squeaking
wail
of
the
wardrobe
door
as
she
opened
and
shut
it
she
waited
listening
when
she
heard
her
mother
come
downstairs
she
went
to
him
mark
did
know
that
the
room
had
been
papa
room
he
did
know
that
she
shivered
when
she
saw
him
sitting
on
the
bed
she
had
stood
just
there
where
mark
feet
were
and
watched
papa
die
she
could
feel
the
basin
slipping
slipping
from
the
edge
of
the
bed
mark
was
happy
there
was
something
he
missed
something
he
wanted
she
had
meant
to
say
it
all
right
nothing
happened
i
have
done
anything
but
she
could
think
about
it
when
she
saw
him
sitting
there
mark
what
is
it
i
do
know
minky
know
you
come
back
and
it
is
like
what
you
thought
it
would
be
no
he
said
it
is
i
did
think
it
would
be
so
awful
without
papa
ii
the
big
package
in
the
hall
had
been
opened
the
tiger
skin
lay
on
the
carpet
mark
was
sorry
for
the
tiger
he
was
only
a
young
cat
you
have
loved
him
minky
if
you
seen
him
with
his
shoulders
down
very
big
cat
shaking
his
haunches
at
you
and
his
eyes
shining
and
playing
cat
eyes
sort
of
swimming
and
shaking
with
his
fun
how
did
you
feel
beastly
mean
to
go
and
shoot
him
when
he
was
happy
and
excited
five
years
without
any
fighting
anything
else
happen
no
no
polo
no
fighting
only
a
mutiny
in
the
battery
once
what
was
it
like
oh
it
just
tumbled
into
the
office
and
yelled
and
waved
jabby
things
and
made
faces
at
you
till
you
nearly
burst
with
laughing
you
laughed
mamma
said
at
a
mutiny
anybody
would
minky
have
laughed
if
she
been
there
it
frightened
them
horribly
because
they
did
expect
it
the
poor
things
never
know
when
they
being
funny
what
happened
said
mary
to
the
mutiny
that
oh
mark
she
adored
him
she
went
to
bed
happy
thinking
of
the
tiger
and
the
mutiny
when
catty
called
her
in
the
morning
she
jumped
out
of
bed
quickly
to
begin
another
happy
day
everything
was
going
to
be
interesting
to
be
exciting
at
any
minute
anything
might
happen
now
that
mark
had
come
home
iii
mark
are
you
coming
she
was
tired
of
waiting
on
the
flagstones
swinging
her
stick
she
called
through
the
house
for
him
to
come
she
looked
through
the
rooms
and
found
him
in
the
study
with
mamma
when
they
saw
her
they
stopped
talking
suddenly
and
mamma
drew
herself
up
and
blinked
mark
shook
his
head
after
all
he
could
come
mamma
wanted
him
mamma
had
him
as
long
as
they
lived
she
would
have
him
mamma
and
mark
were
happy
together
their
happiness
tingled
you
could
feel
it
tingling
like
the
happiness
of
lovers
they
did
want
anybody
but
each
other
you
existed
for
them
as
an
object
in
some
unintelligible
time
and
in
a
space
outside
their
space
the
only
difference
was
that
mark
knew
you
were
there
and
mamma
did
she
chose
the
garthdale
road
yesterday
she
had
gone
that
way
with
mamma
and
mark
she
had
not
talked
to
him
for
when
she
talked
the
pinched
vexed
look
came
into
mamma
face
though
she
pretended
she
had
heard
you
every
now
and
then
mark
had
looked
at
her
over
his
shoulder
and
said
poor
minx
it
was
as
if
he
said
i
sorry
but
you
see
how
it
is
i
ca
help
it
and
just
here
where
the
moor
track
touched
the
road
she
had
left
them
clearing
the
and
had
gone
up
towards
karva
she
had
looked
back
and
seen
them
going
slowly
towards
the
white
sickle
of
the
road
mark
very
upright
taut
muscles
held
in
to
his
shortened
stride
mamma
pathetic
and
fragile
in
her
shawl
moving
with
a
stiff
air
her
love
for
them
was
a
savage
pang
that
cut
her
eyes
and
drew
her
throat
tight
then
suddenly
she
had
heard
mark
whooping
and
she
had
run
back
whooping
and
leaping
down
the
hill
to
walk
with
them
again
she
turned
back
now
at
the
sickle
perhaps
mark
would
come
to
meet
her
he
did
come
she
found
them
sitting
close
on
the
sofa
the
was
pushed
aside
they
were
looking
at
mark
photographs
she
came
and
stood
by
them
to
see
mark
did
look
up
or
say
anything
he
went
on
giving
the
photographs
to
mamma
telling
her

mamma
fingers
twitched
as
she
took
them
one
by
one
women
with
smooth
hair
and
correct
distinguished
faces
she
looked
at
each
face
a
long
time
her
mouth
at
them
she
did
hand
on
the
photographs
to
you
but
laid
them
down
on
the
sofa
one
by
one
as
if
you
were
not
there
a
youngish
woman
in
a
black
silk
gown
robertson
the
wife
a
girl
in
a
white
frock
dicky
carter
she
had
nursed
mark
through
his
fever
a
tall
woman
in
a
riding
habit
and
a
solar
topee
standing
very
straight
looking
very
straight
at
you
under
the
shadow
of
the
topee
mamma
did
mind
the
others
so
much
but
she
was
afraid
of
this
one
there
was
danger
under
the
shadow
of
the
topee
lady
limond
mark
had
stayed
with
them
at
simla
oh
very
handsome
face
very
handsome
you
could
see
by
mark
face
that
he
did
care
about
lady
limond
mamma
had
turned
again
to
the
girl
in
the
white
frock
who
had
nursed
him
are
those
all
mark
those
are
all
she
took
off
her
glasses
and
closed
her
eyes
her
face
was
smooth
now
her
hands
were
quiet
she
had
him
she
would
always
have
him
but
when
he
went
away
for
a
fortnight
to
stay
with
the
man
called
john
she
was
miserable
till
he
had
come
back
safe
iv
whit
sunday
morning
she
would
walk
home
with
mark
after
church
while
mamma
stayed
behind
for
the
sacrament
but
it
did
happen
mark
scowled
as
he
turned
out
into
the
aisle
to
make
way
for
her
he
went
back
into
the
pew
and
sat
there
looking
stiff
and
stubborn
he
would
go
up
with
mamma
to
the
altar
rails
he
would
eat
the
bread
and
drink
the
wine
that
afternoon
she
took
her
book
into
the
garden
mark
came
to
her
there
mamma
tired
with
the
long
service
dozed
in
the
mark
read
over
her
shoulder
haben

der
transcendentalen
aesthetik
hinreichend

do
it
in
english
the
transcendental
aesthetic
we
have
sufficiently
proved
that
all
that
is
perceived
in
space
or
time
and
with
it
all
objects
of
any
experience
possible
to
us
are
mere
vorstellungen
vorstellungen
ideas
presentations
which
so
far
as
they
are
presented
whether
as
extended
things
or
series
of
changes
have
no
existence
grounded
in
themselves
outside
our
thoughts
why
have
you
taken
to
that
dreadful
stodge
i
driven
to
it
it
like
drink
once
you
begin
you
got
to
go
on
what
on
earth
made
you
begin
i
wanted
to
know
things
to
know
what
real
and
what
is
and
at
the
back
of
everything
and
whether
there
anything
there
or
not
and
whether
you
can
know
it
or
not
and
how
you
can
know
anything
at
all
anyhow
i
give
anything
are
you
listening
yes
minky
you
give
anything
i
give
everything
everything
i
possess
to
know
what
the
is
i
rather
know
arabic
or
how
to
make
a
gun
that
would
find
its
own
range
and
feed
itself
with
bullets
sixty
to
the
minute
that
would
be
only
knowing
a
few
more
things
i
want
thing
reality
substance
the
spinoza
calls
it
god
kant
does
but
he
seems
to
think
it
all
the
god
you
ever
get
and
that
even
then
you
ca
know
it
transcendental
idealism
is
just
another
sell
supposing
mark
said
there
is
any
god
at
all
then
i
rather
know
than
go
on
thinking
there
was
one
when
there
was
but
you
feel
sold
sort
of
sold
but
it
the
risk
the
risk
that
makes
it
so
exciting
why
do
think
there
is
any
god
i
afraid
i
think
there
may
be
oh
mark
and
you
went
to
the
sacrament
you
ate
it
and
drank
it
why
should
i
you
do
believe
in
it
any
more
than
i
do
i
never
said
anything
about
believing
in
it
ate
and
drank
poor
jesus
said
he
wanted
you
to
do
that
and
remember
him
i
did
it
and
remembered
jesus
i
do
care
it
was
awful
of
you
much
more
awful
to
spoil
mamma
pleasure
in
god
and
jesus
i
did
it
to
make
her
happy
somebody
had
to
go
with
her
you
would
so
i
did
it
does
matter
minky
nothing
matters
except
mamma
truth
matters
you
die
rather
than
lie
or
do
anything
dishonourable
yet
that
was
dishonourable
i
die
rather
than
hurt
mamma
if
you
make
her
unhappy
minky
i
shall
hate
you
you
ca
go
in
that
thing
they
were
going
to
the
sutcliffes
dance
mamma
had
told
mark
she
did
like
them
she
wanted
mark
to
go
to
the
dance
he
had
said
morfe
was
an
awful
hole
and
it
was
good
for
you
to
live
in
it
the
frock
was
black
muslin
ironed
out
mamma
black
net
indian
scarf
dotted
with
little
green
and
scarlet
flowers
was
drawn
tight
over
her
hips
to
hide
the
place
that
catty
had
scorched
with
the
iron
the
heavy
brilliant
ends
green
and
scarlet
hung
down
behind
she
felt
exquisitely
light
and
slender
mamma
was
shaking
her
head
at
mark
as
he
stared
at
you
if
you
knew
he
said
what
you
look
like
that
the
way
the
funny
ladies
dress
in
the
bazaars
if
you
only
take
that
awful
thing
off
she
ca
take
it
off
mamma
said
he
only
teasing
you
funny
ladies
in
the
bazaars
funny
ladies
in
the
bazaars
bazaars
were
indian
shops
mark
did
mean
though
you
could
tell
that
by
his
face
and
by
mamma
was
that
what
you
really
looked
like
or
was
he
teasing
perhaps
you
would
tell
by
sutcliffe
face
or
by
sutcliffe
their
faces
were
nicer
than
ever
you
could
tell
they
would
never
let
you
know
if
anything
was
wrong
sutcliffe
said
what
a
beautiful
scarf
you
got
on
my
dear
it
mamma
she
gave
it
me
she
wanted
sutcliffe
to
know
that
mamma
had
beautiful
things
and
that
she
would
give
them
the
scarf
was
beautiful
nothing
could
take
from
her
the
feeling
of
lightness
and
slenderness
she
had
in
it
her
programme
stood
nobody
nobody
norman
waugh
charles
sutcliffe
sutcliffe
nobody
nobody
again
all
the
way
down
to
sutcliffe
sutcliffe
sutcliffe
then
mark
sutcliffe
had
wanted
the
last
dance
the
polka
but
she
could
give
it
him
she
did
want
to
dance
with
anybody
after
mark
the
big
long
was
cleared
the
floor
waxed
people
had
come
from
reyburn
and
durlingham
a
hollow
square
of
faces
faces
round
the
walls
painted
faces
hanging
above
them
sutcliffe
ancestors
looking
at
you
the
awful
thing
was
she
did
know
how
to
dance
mark
said
you
have
to
know
it
would
be
all
right
perhaps
it
would
come
suddenly
when
you
heard
the
music
supposing
it
came
like
skating
only
after
you
had
slithered
a
lot
and
tumbled
down
the
feeling
of
lightness
and
slenderness
had
gone
her
feet
stuck
to
the
waxed
floor
as
if
they
were
glued
there
she
was
frightened
it
had
begun
norman
waugh
was
dragging
her
round
the
room
once
twice
she
hated
the
feeling
of
his
short
thick
body
moving
a
little
way
in
front
of
her
she
hated
his
sullen
bull
face
his
mouth
close
to
hers
half
open
puffing
from
the
walls
sutcliffe
ancestors
looked
at
you
as
you
shambled
round
tied
tight
in
your
indian
scarf
like
a
funny
lady
in
the
bazaars
raised
eyebrows
quiet
disdainful
faces
she
was
glad
when
norman
waugh
left
her
on
the
charles
next
he
was
kind
you
trod
on
his
feet
and
he
pretended
he
had
trodden
on
yours
my
dancing
days
are
over
and
mine
have
begun
they
sat
out
and
she
watched
mark
he
did
dance
very
well
he
danced
tightly
and
stiffly
as
if
he
did
like
it
but
he
danced
with
miss
frewin
and
miss
louisa
wright
because
nobody
else
would
with
the
acroyds
because
sutcliffe
made
him
five
dances
with
dorsy
heron
because
he
liked
her
because
he
was
sorry
for
her
because
he
found
her
looking
sad
and
shy
in
a
corner
you
could
see
dorsy
eyes
turn
and
turn
restlessly
to
look
at
mark
and
her
nose
getting
redder
as
he
came
to
her
charles
watched
them
you
knew
what
he
was
thinking
she
in
love
with
him
she
ca
take
her
eyes
off
him
supposing
you
told
her
the
truth
he
wo
marry
you
he
wo
care
for
you
he
wo
care
for
anybody
but
mamma
ca
you
see
by
the
way
he
looks
at
you
the
way
he
holds
you
it
no
use
your
caring
for
him
it
only
make
your
little
nose
redder
he
would
mind
her
red
nose
her
little
proud
nose
he
liked
her
small
face
trying
to
look
austere
with
shy
hare
eyes
her
vague
mouth
pointed
at
the
corners
in
a
sort
of
sharp
tenderness
her
smooth
hair
brushed
back
and
twisted
in
a
tight
coil
at
the
nape
of
her
neck
dorsy
was
sweet
and
gentle
and
unselfish
he
might
have
cared
for
dorsy
if
it
had
been
for
mamma
anyhow
for
one
evening
in
her
life
dorsy
was
happy
dancing
round
and
round
with
her
wild
black
hare
eyes
shining
sutcliffe
she
stood
up
she
would
have
to
tell
him
i
ca
dance
nonsense
you
can
run
and
you
can
jump
of
course
you
can
dance
i
do
know
how
to
the
sooner
you
learn
the
better
i
teach
you
in
two
minutes
he
steered
her
into
the
sheltered
bay
behind
the
piano
they
practised
mark
looking
at
us
is
he
what
has
he
done
to
you
mary
we
go
where
he
ca
look
at
us
they
went
out
into
the
hall
that
it
your
feet
between
mine
in
and
out
do
throw
your
shoulders
back
do
keep
your
elbows
in
it
not
a
hurdle
race
i
wish
it
was
you
wo
in
a
minute
do
count
your
steps
listen
for
the
beat
the
beat
that
does
it
she
began
to
feel
light
and
slender
again
now
you
off
you
all
right
off
turning
and
turning
you
steered
through
the
open
door
in
and
out
among
the
other
dancers
you
skimmed
you
swam
whirling
to
the
steady
of
the
piano
and
the
queer
exciting
squeak
of
the
fiddles
whirling
together
you
and
sutcliffe
and
the
piano
and
the
two
fiddles
one
animal
one
light
slender
animal
whirling
and
playing
every
now
and
then
his
arm
tightened
round
your
waist
with
a
sort
of
impatience
when
it
slackened
you
were
one
light
slender
animal
again
four
feet
and
four
arms
whirling
together
the
piano
was
its
heart
going
and
the
fiddles
why
did
i
think
i
could
do
it
funk
pure
funk
you
wanted
to
dance
you
wanted
to
so
badly
that
it
frightened
you
his
arm
tightened
as
they
passed
she
could
see
sutcliffe
sitting
in
an
pushed
back
out
of
the
dancers
way
she
looked
tired
and
bored
and
a
little
anxious
when
the
last
three
dances
were
over
he
took
her
back
to
mark
mark
scowled
after
sutcliffe
what
does
he
look
at
you
like
that
for
perhaps
he
thinks
i
a
funny
lady
in
a
bazaar
the
sort
of
thing
you
ought
to
say
said
it
all
the
more
reason
why
you

eyes
shone
down
into
yours

whispered

minky
he
swung
you
he
lifted
you
off
your
feet
he
danced
like

carrying
you
on
the
taut
muscle
of
his
arm
somebody
said
that
chap
waked
up
at
last
who
the
girl
somebody
said
his
sister
mark
laughed
out
loud
you
could
have
sworn
he
was
enjoying
himself
but
when
he
got
home
he
said
he
had
enjoyed
himself
at
all
and
he
had
a
headache
the
next
day
it
turned
out
that
he
had
wanted
to
go
he
hated
dancing
mamma
said
he
had
only
gone
because
he
thought
you
like
it
and
because
he
thought
it
would
be
good
for
you
to
dance
like
other
people
vi
why
are
you
always
going
to
the
sutcliffes
mark
said
suddenly
because
i
like
them
they
were
coming
down
the
fields
from
greffington
edge
in
sight
of
the
tennis
court
you
ought
to
like
them
when
they
were
nice
to
poor
papa
if
mamma
does
want
to
know
them
you
ought
to
mark
too
mark
saying
what
mamma
said
her
heart
swelled
and
tightened
she
did
answer
him
anyhow
he
said
you
ought
to
go
about
all
over
the
place
with
old
sutcliffe
when
he
said
old
sutcliffe
his
eyes
were
merry
and
insolent
as
they
used
to
be
what
do
you
do
it
for
because
i
like
him
and
because
there
nobody
else
who
wants
to
go
about
with
me
there
miss
heron
dorsy
is
quite
the
same
thing
whether
she
is
or
is
you
got
to
chuck
it
why
because
mamma
does
like
it
and
i
do
like
it
that
ought
to
be
enough
like
papa
it
is
enough
minky
why
are
you
such
a
brute
to
little
mamma
because
i
ca
help
it
it
all
very
well
for
you
mark
turned
in
the
path
and
looked
at
her
his
tight
firm
face
tighter
and
firmer
she
thought
he
does
know
he
like
mamma
he
wo
see
what
he
does
want
to
see
it
would
be
kinder
not
to
tell
him
but
i
ca
be
kind
he
joined
with
mamma
against
me
they
two
to
one
mamma
must
have
said
something
to
make
him
hate
me
perhaps
she
had
perhaps
he
had
only
seen
her
disapproving
reproachful
face
if
he
says
another
word
if
he
looks
like
that
again
i
shall
tell
him
it
different
for
you
she
said
ever
since
i
began
to
grow
up
i
felt
there
was
something
about
mamma
that
would
kill
me
if
i
let
it
i
had
to
fight
for
every
single
thing
i
ever
wanted
it
awful
fighting
her
when
she
so
sweet
and
gentle
but
it
either
that
or
go
under
minky
you
talk
as
if
she
hated
you
she
does
hate
me
you
lie
he
said
it
gently
without
rancour
no
i
found
that
out
years
ago
she
does
she
hates
me
she
never
knows
that
awful
sort
of
thing
and
of
course
she
loved
me
when
i
was
little
she
love
me
now
if
i
stayed
little
so
that
she
could
do
what
she
liked
with
me
if
i
sit
in
a
corner
and
think
as
she
thinks
and
feel
as
she
feels
and
do
what
she
does
if
you
did
you
be
a
much
nicer
minx

that
i
be
lying
then
the
whole
time
hiding
my
real
self
and
crushing
it

hates
the
thing
she
ca
see
and
touch
and
get
at
the
thing
that
makes
you
different
even
when
i
was
little
she
hated
it
and
tried
to
crush
it
i
remember
things

do
love
her
you
would
talk
like
that
about
her
if
you
loved
her
it
i
love
her
her
self
real
self
when
she
working
in
the
garden
planting
flowers
with
her
blessed
little
hands
doing
what
she
likes
and
when
she
reading
the
bible
and
thinking
about
god
and
jesus
and
when

her
real
self

a
soldier
so
as

altogether
you

to
be
sharpened
before
mark
took
it
into
a
battle
mark
eyes
hurt
her
she
tried
to
fix
her
attention
on
the
blade

want
her
to
see
him
off
at
the
train
he
wanted
to
go
away
alone
after
he
had
said
to
mamma
he
did
want
mamma
to
be
left
by
herself
after
he
had
gone
they
stood
together
by
the
shut
door
of
the
she
and
her
mother
stood
between
mark
and
the
door
she
had
said
a
minute
ago
alone
with
him
in
papa
room
but
there
was
something
they
had
missed
she
thought
we
must
get

now
this
minute
he
say
to
mamma
last
he
kiss
her
last
but
i
must
kiss
him
again

she
came
to
him
holding
up
her
face
he
did
see
her
but
when
his
arm
felt
her
hand
it
jerked
up
and
pushed
her
out
of
his
way
as
he
would
have
pushed
anything
that
stood
there
between
him
and
mamma
xxvi
i
old
peacock
of
sarrack
was
dead
and
kendal
was
the
oldest
man
in
the
dale
he
was
not
afraid
of
death
he
was
only
afraid
of
dying
before
peacock
died
mamma
had
finished
building
the
rockery
in
the
garden
you
had
carried
all
the
stones
there
were
no
more
stones
to
carry
that
was
all
that
had
happened
in
the
year
and
nine
months
since
mark
had
gone
to
you
nothing
happened
nothing
ever
would
happen
at
and
a
half
you
were
old
too
and
very
wise
you
had
given
up
expecting
things
to
happen
you
put
on
your
letters
to
mark
and
dan
and
roddy
instead
of
then
you
measured
time
by
the
poems
you
wrote
and
by
the
books
you
read
and
by
the
sutcliffes
going
abroad
in
january
and
coming
back
in
march
you
had
advanced
from
the
critique
of
pure
reason
to
the
critique
of
practical
reason
and
the
critique
of
judgment
and
the
prolegomena
and
in
the
end
you
were
cheated
you
would
never
know
the
only
thing
worth
knowing
reality
for
all
you
knew
there
was
no
reality
no
god
no
freedom
no
immortality
only
doing
your
duty
you
can
because
you
ought
kant
when
you
got
to
the
bottom
of
him
was
no
more
exciting
than
mamma
kannst
weil
du
why
not
you
can
because
you
shall
it
would
never
do
to
let
mamma
know
what
kant
thought
she
would
say
your
bible
could
have
told
you
that
there
was
schopenhauer
though
did
cheat
you
there
was
pure
perception
it
happened
when
you
looked
at
beautiful
things
beautiful
things
were
crystal
you
looked
through
them
and
saw
reality
you
saw
god
while
the
crystal
flash
lasted
und
the
will
and
the
idea
were
not
divided
as
they
are
in
life
they
were
one
that
was
why
beautiful
things
made
you
happy
and
there
was
mamma
disapproving
reproachful
face
sometimes
you
felt
that
you
could
stand
it
for
another
minute
you
wanted
to
get
away
from
it
to
the
other
end
of
the
world
out
of
the
world
to
die
when
you
were
dead
perhaps
you
would
know
or
perhaps
you
would
perhaps
death
would
cheat
you
too
ii
oh
have
i
come
too
soon
she
had
found
sutcliffe
at
his
in
the
library
a
pile
of
papers
before
him
he
turned
in
his
chair
and
looked
at
her
above
the
fine
lean
hand
that
passed
over
his
face
as
if
it
brushed
cobwebs
they
did
tell
me
you
were
busy
i
not
i
ought
to
be
but
i
not
you
i
go
and
talk
to
sutcliffe
till
you
finished
no
you
stay
here
and
talk
to
me
sutcliffe
really
busy
she
could
see
them
sitting
round
the
waugh
and
miss
frewin
belk
with
her
busy
eyes
and
miss
kendal
and
miss
louisa
oldshaw
and
dorsy
and
horn
the
grocer
wife
very
stiff
in
a
corner
by
herself
sewing
unbleached
calico
and
hot
red
flannel
hot
sunlight
soaking
into
them
the
library
was
dim
and
leathery
and
tobaccoey
and
cool
the
last
time
she
came
on
a
wednesday
sutcliffe
had
popped
out
of
the
and
made
them
go
round
to
the
tennis
court
by
the
back
so
that
they
might
not
be
seen
from
the
windows
she
wondered
why
sutcliffe
was
so
afraid
of
them
being
seen
and
why
she
had
not
looked
quite
pleased
and
there
was
something
about
sutcliffe
you
do
want
to
play
after
tea
when
it
cooler
we
have
it
in
here
by
ourselves
he
got
up
and
rang
the
bell
the
between
them
and
she
pouring
out
the
tea
she
was
grown
up
her
hair
was
grown
up
it
lay
like
a
wreath
plaited
on
the
top
of
her
head
he
was
smoothing
out
the
wrinkles
of
one
hand
with
the
other
and
smiling
everybody
busy
except
you
and
me
mary
how
are
you
getting
on
with
kant
i
done
with
him
it
taken
me
four
years
you
see
either
the
german
hard
or
i
awfully
stupid
german
hard
i
should
imagine
do
you
kant
i
like
him
awfully
when
he
says
exciting
things
about
space
and
time
i
do
like
him
when
he
goes
maundering
on
about
his
old
categorical
imperative
you
can
because
you
ought
putting
you
off
like
a
clergyman
kant
said
that
did
he
that
shows
what
an
old
humbug
he
was
and
it
is
true
mary
it
is
true
if
it
was
it
would
prove
anything
that
what
bothers
me
what
bothers
me
is
that
it
is
true
if
i
did
what
i
ought
i
be
the
busiest
man
in
england
i
would
be
sitting
here
if
i
even
did
what
i
want
do
you
know
what
i
should
like
to
do
to
farm
my
own
land
instead
of
letting
it
out
to
these
fellows
here
i
do
suppose
you
think
me
clever
but
i
got
ideas
what
sort
of
ideas
practical
ideas
ideas
that
can
be
carried
out
that
ought
to
be
carried
out
because
they
can
ideas
about
chemical
manuring
housing
labour
wages
everything
that
has
to
do
with
farming
two
years
ago
you
talked
and
he
listened
now
that
you
were
grown
up
he
talked
to
you
and
you
listened
he
had
said
it
would
make
a
difference
that
was
the
difference
it
made
here
i
am
a
landowner
who
ca
do
anything
with
his
land
and
i
do
anything
for
my
labourers
mary
if
i
keep
a
dry
roof
over
their
heads
and
a
dry
floor
under
their
feet
i
supposed
to
have
done
my
duty
people
will
tell
you
that
sootcliffe
the
great
man
of
the
place
but
half
of
them
look
down
on
him
because
he
does
farm
his
own
land
and
the
other
half
to
him
because
he
does
because
he
the
landlord
and
they
all
think
i
a
dangerous
man
they
do
like
ideas
they
afraid
of
i
like
to
sell
every
acre
i
got
here
and
buy
land
miles
and
miles
of
it
that
has
been
farmed
before
i
show
them
what
farming
is
if
you
bring
brains
to
it
i
see
you
do
that
could
i
the
land
entailed
i
ca
sell
it
away
from
my
son
and
never
do
anything
with
it
are
there
other
things
you
could
have
done
i
suppose
i
could
have
got
the
farmers
out
turned
them
off
the
land
they
sweated
their
lives
into
or
i
could
have
sold
my
town
house
instead
of
letting
it
and
bought
land
of
course
you
could
oh
why
did
you
why
did
i
ah
now
you
got
me
because
i
a
lazy
old
humbug
mary
all
my
farming
in
my
head
when
it
is
on
my
conscience
you
do
really
like
farming
you
only
think
you
ought
to
what
do
you
really
like
going
away
getting
out
of
this
confounded
country
into
the
south
of
france
i
not
really
happy
mary
till
i
pottering
about
my
garden
at
agaye
she
looked
where
he
was
looking
two
drawings
above
the
a
chain
of
red
hills
swung
out
into
a
blue
sea
the
estérel
a
pink
and
white
house
on
the
terrace
of
a
hill
house
and
hill
blazing
out
sunshine
agaye
agaye
pottering
about
his
garden
at
agaye
he
was
happy
there
well
you
can
get
away
to
agaye
not
as
much
as
i
should
like
my
wife
ca
stand
more
than
six
weeks
of
it
so
that
you
are
really
happy
at
agaye
i
thought
i
was
the
only
person
who
felt
like
that
miserable
because
i
been
doing
my
own
things
instead
of
sewing
or
reading
to
mamma
that
the
way
conscience
makes
cowards
of
us
all
if
it
was
even
conscience
but
it
mamma
and
her
conscience
was
grandmamma
and
grandmamma
and
mine
is
yours
a
sort
of
landlord
conscience
your
father
no
no
it
mine
all
right
my
youth
had
a
conscience
are
you
sure
it
was
put
off
with
somebody
else
perhaps
at
oxford
we
were
all
social
reformers
the
collective
conscience
of
the
group
perhaps
i
was
strong
enough
to
rise
to
it
was
strong
enough
to
resist
it
do
you
do
that
my
child
find
out
what
you
want
and
when
you
see
your
chance
coming
take
it
do
funk
it
i
do
see
chance
of
getting
away
where
do
you
want
to
get
away
to
there
agaye
he
leaned
forward
his
eyes
glittered
you
like
that
i
like
it
more
than
anything
on
earth
then
he
said
some
day
you
go
there
no
do
let
talk
about
it
i
shall
never
go
i
do
see
why
not
i
do
really
see
why
not
she
shook
her
head
no
that
sort
of
thing
does
happen
iii
she
stitched
and
stitched
making
new
underclothing
it
was
going
to
happen
summer
and
christmas
and
the
new
year
had
gone
in
another
week
it
would
happen
she
would
be
sitting
with
the
sutcliffes
in
the
express
going
with
them
to
agaye
she
had
to
have
new
underclothing
they
would
be
two
days
in
paris
they
would
pass
in
the
train
through
dijon
avignon
toulon
and
cannes
then
back
to
agaye
she
had
no
idea
what
it
would
be
like
only
the
sounds
agaye
rose
up
out
of
the
other
sounds
like
a
song
a
slender
foreign
song
bright
and
clear
that
you
could
sing
without
knowing
what
it
meant
she
would
stay
there
with
the
sutcliffes
for
weeks
and
weeks
in
the
pink
and
white
house
on
the
terrace
perhaps
they
would
go
on
into
italy
sutcliffe
was
going
to
send
to
cook
for
the
tickets
expensive
clothes
had
come
from
durlingham
so
that
nothing
could
prevent
it
happening
sutcliffe
was
paying
for
her
ticket
uncle
victor
had
paid
for
the
clothes
he
had
kept
on
writing
to
mamma
and
telling
her
that
she
really
ought
to
let
you
go
aunt
bella
and
uncle
edward
had
written
and
draper
and
in
the
end
mamma
had
given
in
at
first
she
had
said
i
wo
hear
of
your
going
abroad
with
the
sutcliffes
and
the
sutcliffes
seem
to
think
they
a
right
to
take
you
away
from
me
they
only
to
say
and
you
go
then
i
suppose
you
have
to
go
and
i
do
know
what
your
uncle
victor
thinks
they
do
for
you
but
he
sha
say
i
stood
in
your
way
and
suddenly
her
face
left
off
disapproving
and
reproaching
and
behaved
as
it
did
on
christmas
days
and
birthdays
she
smiled
now
as
she
sat
still
and
sewed
as
she
watched
you
sitting
still
and
sewing
making
new
underclothes
aunt
bella
would
come
and
stay
with
mamma
then
aunt
lavvy
then
draper
so
that
she
would
not
be
left
alone
stitch
stitch
she
wondered
supposing
they
were
coming
could
she
have
left
her
mother
alone
or
would
she
have
given
up
going
and
stayed
no
she
could
have
given
it
up
she
had
never
wanted
anything
in
her
life
as
she
wanted
to
go
to
agaye
with
the
sutcliffes
with
sutcliffe
sutcliffe
did
count
she
would
do
anything
at
agaye
she
would
just
trail
about
in
the
background
kind
and
smiling
in
a
shawl
she
might
almost
as
well
not
be
there
the
happiness
was
too
great
she
could
not
possibly
have
given
it
up
she
went
on
stitching
mamma
went
on
stitching
catty
brought
the
lamp
in
then
roddy
telegram
came
from
queenstown
been
coming
home
expect
me
rodney
she
knew
then
that
she
would
not
go
to
agaye
iv
but
not
all
at
once
when
she
thought
of
roddy
it
was
easy
to
say
quietly
to
herself
i
shall
have
to
give
it
up
when
she
thought
of
sutcliffe
and
the
train
and
the
shining
unknown
towns
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
was
impossible
to
give
up
going
to
agaye
you
simply
could
not
do
it
she
shut
her
eyes
she
could
feel
sutcliffe
beside
her
in
the
train
and
the
carriage
rocking
dijon
avignon
cannes
she
could
hear
his
voice
telling
her
the
names
she
would
stand
beside
him
at
the
window
and
look
out
and
sutcliffe
would
sit
in
her
corner
and
smile
at
them
kindly
glad
because
they
were
so
happy
roddy
does
say
he
ill
her
mother
said
i
wonder
what
coming
home
for
supposing
you
had
really
gone
supposing
you
were
at
agaye
when
roddy
the
thought
of
roddy
gave
her
a
pain
in
her
heart
the
thought
of
not
going
to
agaye
dragged
at
her
waist
and
made
her
feel
weak
suddenly
as
if
she
were
trying
to
stand
after
an
illness
she
went
up
to
her
room
the
shoulder
line
of
greffington
edge
was
fixed
across
the
open
window
immovable
immutable
her
knees
felt
tired
she
lay
down
on
her
bed
staring
at
the
immovable
immutable
white
walls
she
tried
to
think
of
substance
of
the
reality
behind
appearances
she
could
feel
her
mind
battering
at
the
walls
of
her
body
the
walls
of
her
room
the
walls
of
the
world
she
could
hear
it
crying
out
she
was
kneeling
now
beside
her
bed
she
could
see
her
arms
stretched
out
before
her
on
the
counterpane
and
her
hands
the
together
she
pressed
her
weak
dragging
waist
tighter
against
the
bed
if
anything
there
if
anything
there
make
me
give
up
going
make
me
think
about
roddy
not
about
myself
about
roddy
make
me
not
want
to
go
to
agaye
she
did
really
believe
that
anything
would
happen
her
mind
left
off
crying
outside
the
clock
on
the
congregational
chapel
was
striking
six
she
was
aware
of
a
sudden
checking
and
letting
go
of
a
black
stillness
coming
on
and
on
hushing
sound
and
sight
and
the
touch
of
her
arms
on
the
rough
counterpane
and
her
breathing
and
the
beating
of
her
heart
there
was
a
sort
of
rhythm
in
the
blackness
that
caught
you
and
took
you
into
its
peace
when
the
thing
stopped
you
could
almost
hear
the
click
she
stood
up
her
white
room
was
grey
across
the
window
the
shoulder
of
the
hill
had
darkened
out
there
the
night
crouched
breathing
like
an
immense
quiet
animal
she
had
a
sense
of
exquisite
security
and
clarity
and
joy
she
was
not
going
to
agaye
she
did
want
to
go
she
thought
i
shall
have
to
tell
the
sutcliffes
now
this
evening
and
mamma
they
be
sorry
and
mamma
will
be
glad
but
mamma
was
not
glad
mamma
hated
it
when
you
upset
arrangements
she
said
i
declare
i
never
saw
anybody
like
you
in
my
life
after
all
the
trouble
and
expense
but
you
could
see
it
was
roddy
she
was
thinking
about
she
did
want
to
believe
there
was
anything
the
matter
with
him
if
you
went
that
would
look
as
though
he
was
all
right
what
do
you
suppose
the
sutcliffes
will
think
and
your
uncle
victor
with
all
those
new
clothes
and
that
new
trunk
he
understand
he
sutcliffe
i
mean
she
went
down
to
greffington
hall
that
night
and
told
him
he
understood
but
not
quite
so
well
as
sutcliffe
she
gave
you
a
long
look
sighed
and
smiled
almost
you
would
have
thought
she
was
glad
did
look
at
you
he
looked
down
at
his
own
lean
fine
hands
hanging
in
front
of
him
you
could
see
them
trembling
slightly
and
when
you
were
going
he
took
you
into
the
library
and
shut
the
door
is
this
necessary
mary
he
said
yes
we
do
quite
know
what
wrong
with
roddy
then
why
not
wait
and
see
because
i
know
and
mamma
does
there
something
or
he
would
have
come
home
a
long
pause
she
noticed
little
things
about
him
the
proud
handsome
corners
of
his
mouth
had
loosened
his
eyelids
did
fit
nicely
as
they
used
to
do
they
hung
slack
from
the
eyebone
you
care
more
for
roddy
than
you
do
for
mark
he
said
i
do
care
for
him
half
so
much
but
i
sorry
for
him
you
ca
be
sorry
for
mark
roddy
wants
me
and
mark
does
he
wants
nobody
but
mamma
he
knows
what
he
wants
well
it
my
fault
i
should
have
known
what
i
wanted
i
should
have
taken
you
a
year
ago
if
you
had
she
said
it
would
have
been
all
over
now
i
wonder
would
it
for
the
life
of
her
she
could
imagine
what
he
meant
when
she
got
home
she
found
her
mother
folding
up
the
work
in
the
well
anyhow
mamma
said
you
laid
in
a
good
stock
of
underclothing
vi
she
was
sitting
in
the
big
leather
chair
in
the
the
small
window
panes
and
the
black
crooked
bough
of
the
apple
tree
across
them
made
a
pattern
in
her
brain
charles
stood
before
her
on
the
hearthrug
she
saw
his
shark
tooth
hanging
sharp
in
the
snap
of
his
jaws
he
was
powerful
savage
and
benevolent
he
had
told
her
what
was
wrong
with
roddy
what
does
it
mean
the
savage
light
went
out
of
his
eyes
they
were
dull
and
kind
under
his
red
shaggy
eyebrows
it
means
that
you
wo
have
him
with
you
very
long
mary
that
roddy
would
die
that
roddy
would
die
that
was
what
he
had
come
home
for
he
ought
never
to
have
gone
out
with
his
heart
in
that
state
it
beats
me
how
he
pulled
through
those
five
years
five
weeks
of
it
were
enough
to
kill
him
jem
alderson
must
have
taken
mighty
good
care
of
him
jem
alderson
she
remembered
the
big
shoulders
the
little
screwed
up
eyes
the
long
moustaches
the
good
gladiator
face
jem
alderson
had
taken
care
of
him
jem
alderson
had
cared
i
do
know
what
your
mother
could
have
been
thinking
of
to
let
him
go
mamma
does
think
of
things
it
was
her
fault
she
did
know
uncle
edward
and
uncle
victor
made
him
they
ought
to
be
hung
for
it
they
did
know
either
it
was
my
fault
knew
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
known
that
she
had
known
all
the
time
that
she
remembered
knowing
did
he
tell
you
he
did
tell
anybody
did
he
know
yes
mary
he
came
to
me
to
be
overhauled
i
told
him
he
was
fit
to
go
i
did
to
stop
him
why
he
looked
at
her
sharply
as
if
he
were
trying
to
find
out
something
to
fix
responsibility
because
i
you
could
have
known
if
nobody
told
you
i
did
know
if
he
dies
i
shall
have
killed
him
i
ought
to
have
stopped
him
i
was
the
only
one
who
knew
you
could
have
stopped
him
you
were
only
a
child
yourself
when
it
happened
if
anybody
was
to
blame
it
was
his
mother
it
was
she
did
know
mamma
never
knows
anything
she
does
want
to
know
she
ca
see
that
he
ill
now
she
talks
as
if
he
ought
to
do
something
she
ca
stand
men
who
do
do
things
like
mark
and
dan
what
on
earth
does
she
suppose
he
could
do
he
no
more
fit
to
do
anything
than
my
brother
james
you
have
to
take
care
of
him
mary
a
sharp
and
tender
pang
went
through
her
it
was
like
desire
like
the
feeling
you
had
when
you
thought
of
babies
painful
and
at
the
same
time
delicious
could
you
said
charles
of
course
i
can
if
he
taken
care
of
he
might
live
she
stood
up
and
faced
him
how
long
i
do
know
perhaps
he
went
with
her
to
the
door
perhaps
he
said
quite
a
long
time
but
if
he
did
live
she
would
have
killed
him
she
had
known
all
the
time
and
she
had
let
him
go
through
the
window
she
could
see
roddy
as
he
crouched
over
the
hearth
holding
out
his
hands
to
the
fire
he
was
hers
not
mamma
to
take
care
of
sharp
delicious
pain
vii
oh
roddy
look
little
little
grouse
making
nice
noises
the
nestlings
went
flapping
and
stumbling
through
the
roots
of
the
heather
roddy
gazed
at
them
with
his
fixed
and
mournful
eyes
he
could
share
your
excitement
he
drew
back
his
shoulders
bracing
himself
to
bear
it
his
lips
tightened
in
a
hard
bleak
grin
he
grinned
at
the
absurdity
of
your
supposing
that
he
could
be
interested
in
anything
any
more
roddy
beautiful
face
was
bleached
and
sharpened
the
sallow
skin
stretched
close
over
the
bone
but
below
the
edge
of
his
cap
you
could
see
the
fine
spring
of
his
head
from
his
neck
like
the
spring
of
mark
head
they
were
in
april
now
he
was
getting
better
he
could
walk
up
the
lower
slopes
of
karva
without
panting
why
are
we
ever
out
he
said
supposing
we
went
home
all
right
let
he
was
like
that
when
he
was
in
the
house
he
wanted
to
be
on
the
moor
when
he
was
on
the
moor
he
wanted
to
be
back
in
the
house
they
started
to
go
home
and
he
turned
again
towards
karva
they
went
on
till
they
came
to
the
round
pit
sunk
below
the

out
through

and
the
scullery
catty
was
happy
now
that
maggie
had
gone
and
she
had
only
you
and
jesus
with
her
in
the
kitchen
through
the
open
door
you
could
hear
the
clack
of
the
hatchet
and
the
thud
on
the
stone
flags
as
roddy
with
slow
sorrowful
strokes
chopped
wood
in

miss

catty
thick
loving
voice
and
the
jerk
of
her
black
eyes
warned
her
mamma

in
at

that
book
away
she
said
she
hated
the
two
brown
volumes
of
elwes
spinoza
you
had
bought
for
your
birthday
the
dinner
will
be
ruined
if
you
read
it
be
ruined
if
i
do
read
for
then
your
mind
raged
over
the
saucepans
and
the
fragrant
floury
pasteboard
hungry
and
unfed
it
could
bring
anything
about
it
snatched
at
the
minutes
left
over
from
roddy
and
the
house
and
mamma
and
the
piano
you
knew
what
every
day
would
be
like
you
would
get
up
early
to
practise
when
the
cooking
and
the
housework
was
done
roddy
would
want
you
you
would
play
tennis
together
with
sutcliffe
and
dorsy
heron
or
you
would
go
up
on
to
the
moors
and
comfort
roddy
while
he
talked
about
the
things
he
had
done
in
canada
and
about
getting
away
and
about
the
dog
you
would
say
over
and
over
again
you
know
you
did
hang
him
it
was
jem
uncle
he
was
a
bad
dog
he
bit
the
sheep
in
the
winter
evenings
you
would
sew
or
play
or
read
aloud
to
mamma
and
roddy
and
roddy
would
crouch
over
the
fender
with
his
hands
stretched
out
to
the
fire
not
listening
but
roddy
was
better
the
wind
whipped
red
blood
into
his
cheeks
he
said
he
would
be
well
if
it
was
for
the
bleating
of
the
sheep
and
the
crying
of
the
peewits
and
the
shouting
of
the
damned
villagers
and
people
staring
at
him
he
would
be
well
if
he
could
get
away
then
he
would
be
well
if
he
could
marry
dorsy
so
the
first
year
passed
and
the
second
and
the
third
year

up

heaved
up
the
big
stones
and
packed
them
in
mortar

had
laid
them
true
by
the
blenkiron

the
last
dab
of
mortar
to
the
last
stone
in
the
blue
and
white

in
the
garden
looking
at
the
wall
in
its
setting
of
clean
white
cement
roddy
bit
showed
like
the
map
of
south
africa
they
were
waiting
for
him
to
come
down
to
breakfast
i
must
say
mamma
said
he
earned
his
extra
in
bed
she
was
pleased
because
roddy
had
built
the
wall
up
and
because
he
was
well
again
they
had
turned
they
were
walking
on
the
flagged
path
by
the
under
the
house
mamma
walked
slowly
with
meditative
pauses
and
bright
sidelong
glances
for
her
flowers
if
only
she
said
he
could
work
without
trampling
the
flowers
down
the
sun
was
shining
on
the
flagged
path
mamma
was
stooping
over
the
bed
she
had
lifted
the
stalk
of
the
daffodil
up
out
of
the
sunk
print
of
roddy
boot
catty
was
coming
down
the
house
passage
to
the
side
door
her
mouth
was
open
her
eyes
stared
above
her
high
sallow
cheeks
she
stood
on
the
doorstep
saying
something
in
a
husky
voice
miss
mary
will
you
go
upstairs
to
master
roddy
i
think
something
the
matter
with
him

upstairs
in
his
narrow
iron
bed
roddy
lay
on
his
back
his
lips
parted
his
eyes
white
slits
under
lids
turned
up
to
the
ceiling
his
arms
were
squared
stiffly
above
his
chest
as
they
had
pushed
back
the
bedclothes
the
hands
had
been
clenched
and
unclenched
the
fingers
still
curled
in
towards
the
palms
his
face
had
a
look
of
innocence
and
candour
catty
thick
wet
voice
soaked
through
his
mother
crying
miss
mary
he
went
in
his
first
sleep
his
hair
as
smooth
as
smooth
x
she
was
alone
with
dan
in
the
funeral
carriage
her
heart
heaved
and
dragged
with
the
grinding
of
the
brakes
on
the
hill
the
brake
of
the
hearse
going
in
front
the
brake
of
their
carriage
the
brake
of
the
one
that
followed
with
charles
in
it
when
they
left
off
she
could
hear
dan
crying
he
had
begun
as
soon
as
he
got
into
the
carriage
she
tried
to
think
of
charles
sitting
all
by
himself
in
the
back
carriage
calm
and
comfortable
among
the
wreaths
but
she
could
she
could
think
of
anything
but
dan
and
the
black
hearse
in
front
of
them
she
could
see
it
when
the
road
turned
to
the
right
when
she
shut
her
eyes
she
could
see
the
yellow
coffin
inside
it
heaped
with
white
flowers
and
roddy
lying
deep
down
in
the
coffin
the
sides
were
made
high
to
cover
his
arms
squared
over
his
chest
as
if
he
had
been
beating
something
off
she
could
see
roddy
arms
beating
off
his
thoughts
and
under
the
fine
hair
roddy
face
innocent
and
candid
charles
said
it
was
that
he
had
just
raised
them
in
surprise
a
sort
of
surprise
he
had
suffered
dan
dark
head
was
bowed
forward
just
above
the
level
of
her
knees
his
deep
hot
eyes
were
inflamed
with
grief
they
kept
on
blinking
gushing
out
tears
over
red
lids
he
cried
like
a
child
with
loud
sobs
and
hiccoughs
that
shook
him
eyes
were
dry
burning
dry
the
lids
choked
with
something
that
felt
like
hot
sand
and
hurt
if
only
the
carriage
did
smell
of
brandy
that
was
the
driver
he
must
have
sat
in
it
while
he
waited
dan
left
off
crying
and
sat
up
suddenly
what
that
hat
doing
there
he
had
taken
off
his
tall
hat
as
he
was
getting
into
the
carriage
and
laid
it
on
the
empty
seat
he
pointed
at
the
hat
that
is
my
hat
he
said
yes
dank
you
put
it
there
yourself
i
did
my
hat
has
got
a
beastly
black
band
on
it
he
rose
violently
knocking
his
head
against
the
carriage
roof
here
i
must
get
out
of
this
he
tugged
at
the
hanging
on
to
it
and
swaying
as
he
tugged
she
dragged
him
back
into
his
seat
sit
down
and
keep
quiet
she
put
her
hand
on
his
wrist
and
held
it
down
the
road
the
bell
of
renton
church
began
tolling
he
turned
and
looked
at
her
unsteadily
his
dark
eyes
showing
bloodshot
as
they
swerved
mary
is
roddy
really
dead
a
warm
steam
of
brandy
came
and
went
with
his
breathing
yes
that
why
you
must
keep
quiet
rollitt
was
standing
at
the
open
gate
of
the
churchyard
he
was
saying
something
that
she
did
hear
then
he
swung
round
solemnly
she
saw
the
flash
of
his
scarlet
hood
then
the
coffin
she
began
to
walk
behind
it
between
two
rows
of
villagers
between
dorsy
heron
and
sutcliffe
she
went
holding
dan
tight
pulling
him
closer
when
he
lurched
and
carrying
his
tall
hat
in
her
hand
close
before
her
face
the
head
of
roddy
coffin
swayed
and
swung
as
the
bearers
staggered
xi
roddy
ought
never
to
have
gone
to
canada
her
mother
had
turned
again
shaking
the
big
bed
they
would
sleep
together
for
three
nights
then
aunt
bella
would
come
as
she
came
when
papa
died
but
your
uncle
victor
would
have
his
own
way
he
did
know
she
thought
but
knew
i
knew
and
i
let
him
go
why
did
i
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
was
because
deep
down
inside
her
she
had
wanted
him
to
go
deep
down
inside
her
she
had
been
afraid
of
the
unhappiness
that
would
come
through
roddy
and
i
do
think
her
mother
said
presently
it
have
been
very
good
for
him
building
that
wall
you
did
know
she
thought
i
have
known
if
i
been
here

would
have
happened

dog
with

white
breast
and

carefully

to
play
on
it
again
the
side
door
stood
open

went
out
in
the
bed
by
the
flagged
path

saw
the
sunk
print
of
roddy
foot
and
the
dead
daffodil
stalk
lying
in
it

had
been
angry
she
had
forgotten

in
the
minutes
before
catty
had
come
down
the
passage
she
filled
in
the
footprint
and
stroked

earth
smooth
above
it

see
it

forward
heavily
his

dropped
to
his

something
slimy
gleamed
on
his

and
hip
wet
mud
of
the

had
fallen
in

a

flashed
under

the

of
a

stuck
up
out
of

took

and
piteous
in

he
came
back
with
the

come
the
three
volumes
the
bristling
gothic
text
an
ambush
of
secret
exciting
formidable
things
the
titles
flamed
flags
of
strange
battles
signals
of
strange
ships
challenging
enticing
to
the
dangerous
adventure
after
the
first
enchantment
the
buddhist
suttas
and
the
upanishads
were
no
good
nor
yet
the
vedânta
you
could
keep
on
saying
this
is
that
and
thou
art
it
or
that
the
self
is
the
dark
blue
bee
and
the
green
parrot
with
red
eyes
and
the
the
seasons
and
the
seas
it
was
too
easy
too
sleepy
like
lying
on
a
sofa
and
dropping
laudanum
slowly
into
a
rotten
aching
tooth
your
teeth
were
sound
and
strong
they
had
to
have
something
hard
to
bite
on
you
wanted
to
think
to
keep
on
thinking
your
mind
was
really
like
a
tooth
it
was
like
a
robust
energetic
body
happy
when
it
was
doing
difficult
and
dangerous
things
balancing
itself
on
heights
lifting
great
weights
of
thought
following
the
long
march
into
thick
smoky
battles
being
and
are
the
same
ironic
and
superb
defiance
and
then
commotion
as
if
the
infinite
stillness
the
immovable
substance
had
got
up
and
begun
moving
rhythm
of
eternity
the
same
for
ever
for
ever
different
for
ever
the
same
thought
the
this
man
was
saying
over
and
over
and
all
the
time
what
you
had
wanted
kant
to
say
what
he
would
say
what
you
could
squeeze
out
of
him
however
you
turned
and
twisted
him
you
jumped
to
where
the
name
spinoza
glittered
like
a
jewel
on
the
large
grey
page
something
wanting
you
knew
it
and
you
were
afraid
you
loved
him
you
did
want
him
to
be
found
out
and
exposed
like
kant
he
had
given
you
the
first
incomparable
thrill
hegel
spinoza
she
thought
of
spinoza
murky
mysterious
face
it
said
i
live
in
you
still
as
he
will
never
live
you
will
never
love
that
old
german
man
he
ran
away
from
the
cholera
he
bolstered
up
the
trinity
with
his
triple
dialectic
to
keep
his
chair
at
berlin
refused
their
bribes
they
excommunicated
me
you
remember
cursed
be
baruch
spinoza
in
his
going
out
and
his
coming
in
you
had
tried
to
turn
and
twist
spinoza
too
and
always
he
had
refused
to
come
within
your
meaning
his
substance
his
god
stood
still
in
eternity
he
too
before
the
noisy
rich
exciting
hegel
he
drew
back
into
its
stillness
pure
and
cold
a
little
sinister
a
little
ironic
and
you
felt
a
pang
of
misgiving
as
if
after
all
he
might
have
been
right
so
powerful
had
been
his
hold
dan
looked
up
what
are
you
reading
mary

one

an

smell
of

through

on
the
slender
white
gown
she
wore
when
she
dined
at
the
sutcliffes
dan
friend
lindley
vickers
was
sitting
on
the
sofa
talking
to

when
she
came
in
he
left
off
talking
and
looked
at
her
with
sudden
happy
eyes
she
remembered
maurice
jourdain
disappointed
eyes
and
mark
dan
became
suddenly
very
polite
and
attentive
all
through
dinner
vickers
kept
on
turning
his
eyes
away
from
mamma
and
looking
at
her
every
time
she
looked
she
caught
him
looking
his
dark
hair
sprang
in
two
ridges
from
the
parting
his
short
nose
seemed
to
be
looking
at
you
too
with
its
wide
nostrils
alert
his
face
did
all
sorts
of
vivid
interesting
things
you
wondered
every
minute
whether
this
time
it
would
be
straight
and
serious
or
crooked
and
gay
whether
his
eyes
would
stay
as
they
were
black
crystals
or
move
and
show
grey
rings
green
speckled
he
was
alive
running
over
with
life
no
not
running
over
vibrating
with
it
holding
it
in
he
looked
as
if
he
expected
something
delightful
to
happen
and
waited
excited
ready
he
began
talking
about

turned
and
looked
at
her
with
a
sombre

mamma
smiled
and
nodded
her
chin
as
much
as
to
say
did
you
ever
hear
such
nonsense
she
knew
that
was
the
way
to
stop
you
vickers
eyes
were
large
and
attentive
when
you
stopped
his
mouth
gave
such
a
sidelong
leap
of
surprise
and
amusement
that
you
laughed
then
he
laughed
dan
said
what
the
joke
and
vickers
replied
that
it
was
a
joke
in
the
mamma
said

but
if

like
that
about
it
then
her
hands
dropped
from
the
keys
it
was
possible
he
only

on
friday
evening
last

i

and
turn
nannie
learoyd
face
looking
in
naughty
nannie
you
could
see
her
big
pink
cheeks
and
her
scarlet
mouth
and
her
eyes
sliding
and
peering
poor
pretty
naughty
nannie
nannie
smiled
when
she
met
you
on
the
green
as
if
she
trusted
you
not
to
tell
how
you
saw
her
after
dark
slinking
about
the
back
lane
waiting
for
young
horn
to
come
out
to
her
the
door
opened
nannie
slid
away
it
was
only
mamma
mary
she
said
i
wish
you
would
remember
that
vickers
has
come
to
see
dan
and
that
he
has
only
got
two
days
more
it
all
right
he
going
into
reyburn
with
him
i
sure
her
mother
said
i
wish
he
stay
here
she
pottered
about
the
room
taking
things
up
and
putting
them
down
again
presently
catty
came
for
her
and
she
went
out
mary
began
to
play
the
sonata
she
thought
i
do
care
if
he
does
come
i
want
to
play
it
and
i
shall
he
came
he
stood
close
beside
her
and
listened
once
he
put
his
hand
on
her
arm
oh
no
he
said
like
that
she
stood
up
and
faced
him
tell
me
the
truth
shall
i
ever
be
any
good
shall
i
ever
play
do
you
really
want
the
truth
of
course
i
do
her
mind
fastened
itself
on
her
playing
it
hid
and
sheltered
itself
behind
her
playing
let
look
at
your
hands
she
gave
him
her
hands
he
lifted
them
he
felt
the
small
bones
sliding
under
the
skin
he
bent
back
the
padded
tips
the
joints
of
the
fingers
there
no
reason
why
you
should
have
played
magnificently
he
said
only
i
do
i
never
have
no
you
never
have
he
came
closer
she
did
know
whether
he
drew
her
to
him
or
whether
he
came
closer
a
queer
delicious
feeling
a
new
feeling
thrilled
through
her
body
to
her
mouth
to
her
her
head
swam
slightly
she
kept
her
eyes
open
by
an
effort
he
gave
her
back
her
hands
she
remembered
they
had
been
talking
about
her
playing
i
knew
she
said
it
was
bad
in
places
i
do
care
whether
it
bad
or
good
it
you
the
only
part
of
you
that
can
get
out
you
very
bad
in
places
but
you
do
something
to
me
all
the
same
what
do
i
do
you
know
what
you
do
i
do
i
do
really
tell
me
if
you
do
know
i
ca
tell
you
dear
he
said
it
so
thickly
that
she
was
not
sure
at
the
time
whether
he
had
really
said
it
she
remembered
afterwards
there
dan
she
whispered
he
swung
himself
off
from
her
and
made
himself
a
rigid
figure
at
the
window
dan
stood
in
the
doorway
he
was
trying
to
took
as
if
she
there
i
say
are
you
coming
to
reyburn
no
i
not
why
not
i
got
a
headache
headache
outside
on
the
flagstones
she
saw
nannie
pass
again
and
look
in
viii
an
hour
later
she
was
sitting
on
the
slope
under
the
hill
road
of
greffington
edge
he
lay
on
his
back
beside
her
in
the
bracken
lindley
vickers
suddenly
he
pulled
himself
up
into
a
sitting
posture
like
her
own
she
was
then
aware
that
sutcliffe
had
gone
up
the
road
behind
them
he
had
lifted
his
hat
and
passed
her
without
speaking
what
does
sutcliffe
talk
to
you
about
farming
and
what
do
you
do
listen
below
them
across
the
dale
they
could
see
the
square
of
morfe
on
its
platform
how
long
have
you
lived
in
that
place
ten
years
no
eleven
women

said

wonderful
i
ca

your
father

your
mother
and
victor
olivier
and
your
aunt
which
aunt
the
unitarian
lady
and
i
knew
mark
and
rodney
they
do
account
for
you
does
anybody
account
for
anybody
else
yes
you
believe
in
heredity
i
do
know
enough
about
it
you
should
read
haeckel
history
of
and
herbert
spencer
and
ribot
it
would
interest
you
no
it
would
it
would
interest
you
a
bit
it
sounds
as
if
it
would
rather
it
would
look
here
promise
me
you
wo
think
about
it
let
it
alone
promise
me
he
was
like
jimmy
making
you
promise
not
to
hang
out
of
windows
no
good
making
promises
well
he
said
there
nothing
in
it
i
wish
i
had
said
that
about
your
playing
i
only
wanted
to
see
whether
you
mind
or
not
i
do
mind
what
does
it
matter
when
i
making
music
i
think
nothing
but
music
in
all
the
world
when
i
doing
philosophy
i
think
there
nothing
but
philosophy
in
all
the
world
when
i
writing
verses
i
think
there
nothing
but
writing
in
all
the
world
and
when
playing
tennis
i
think
there
nothing
but
tennis
in
all
the
world
i
see
and
when
you
suffer
you
think
there
nothing
but
suffering
in
all
the
world
yes
and
when
and
when
his
face
was
straight
and
serious
and
quiet
his
eyes
covered
her
first
her
face
then
her
breasts
she
knew
he
could
see
her
bodice
quiver
with
the
beating
of
her
heart
she
felt
afraid
then
he
said
you
not
think
you
know
she
thought
he
did
say
it
he
wo
he
ca
it
is
possible
had
we
better
go
he
sprang
to
his
feet
much
better
he
said
ix
she
would
not
see
him
again
that
day
dan
was
going
to
dine
with
him
at
the
buck
hotel
when
dan
came
back
from
reyburn
he
said
he
would
go
he
had
a
headache
if
vickers
could
have
a
headache
so
could
he
he
sulked
all
evening
in
the
by
himself
but
towards
nine
he
thought
better
of
it
and
went
round
he
said
to
look
vickers
up
her
mother
yawned
over
her
book
and
the
yawns
made
her
impatient
she
wanted
to
be
out
of
doors
walking
instead
of
sitting
there
listening
to
mamma
at
nine
mamma
gave
one
supreme
yawn
and
dragged
herself
to
bed
she
went
out
through
the
orchard
into
the
back
lane
she
could
see
nannie
learoyd
sitting
on
the
stone
stairs
of
horn
granary
waiting
for
young
horn
to
come
round
the
corner
of
his
yard
perhaps
they
would
go
up
into
the
granary
and
hide
under
the
straw
she
turned
into
the
field
track
to
the
schoolhouse
and
the
highway
in
the
dark
bottom
the
river
lay
like
a
broad
white
glittering
road
she
stopped
by
the
schoolhouse
considering
whether
she
would
go
up
to
the
moor
by
the
high
fields
and
come
back
down
the
lane
or
go
up
the
lane
and
come
back
down
the
fields
too
dark
to
find
the
gaps
if
i
come
back
by
the
fields
she
had
forgotten
the
hidden
moon
there
was
a
breaking
twilight
when
she
reached
the
lane
she
came
down
at
a
swinging
stride
her
feet
went
on
the
grass
borders
without
a
sound
at
the
last
crook
of
the
lane
she
came
suddenly
on
a
man
and
woman
standing
in
her
path
by
the
stone
wall
it
would
be
nannie
learoyd
and
young
horn
they
were
fixed
in
one
block
their
faces
tilted
backwards
their
bodies
motionless
the
woman
arms
were
round
the
man
neck
his
arms
round
her
waist
there
was
something
about
the
queer
faces
queer
and
ugly
as
she
came
on
she
saw
them
break
loose
from
each
other
and
swing
apart
nannie
learoyd
and
lindley
vickers
x
she
lay
awake
all
night
her
brain
incapable
of
thought
kept
turning
round
and
round
showing
her
on
an
endless
rolling
screen
the
images
of
lindley
and
nannie
learoyd
clinging
together
loosening
swinging
apart
clinging
together
when
she
came
down
on
sunday
morning
breakfast
was
over
sunday
sunday
she
remembered
last
night
was
saturday
night
lindley
vickers
was
coming
to
sunday
dinner
and
sunday
supper
she
would
have
to
get
away
somewhere
to
dorsy
or
the
sutcliffes
she
did
want
to
see
him
again
she
wanted
to
forget
that
she
ever
had
seen
him
her
mother
and
dan
had
shut
themselves
up
in
the
she
found
them
there
talking
as
she
came
in
they
stopped
abruptly
and
looked
at
each
other
her
mother
began
picking
at
the
pleats
in
her
gown
with
nervous
agitated
fingers
dan
got
up
and
left
the
room
well
mary
you
not
see
vickers
again
he
just
told
dan
he
is
coming
then
he
knew
that
she
had
seen
him
in
the
lane
with
nannie
i
do
want
to
see
him
she
said
it
a
pity
you
did
think
of
that
before
you
put
us
in
such
a
position
she
understood
lindley
but
she
was
even
trying
to
understand
her
mother
the
vexed
face
and
picking
fingers
meant
nothing
to
her
she
was
saying
to
herself
i
ca
tell
mamma
i
saw
him
with
nannie
in
the
lane
i
ought
to
have
seen
him
he
did
know
anybody
was
there
he
want
me
to
see
him
i
be
a
perfect
beast
to
tell
her
her
mother
went
on
i
do
know
what
to
do
with
you
mary
one
would
have
thought
my
only
daughter
would
have
been
a
comfort
to
me
but
i
declare
you
given
me
more
trouble
than
any
of
my
children
more
than
dan
dan
had
a
chance
he
have
been
different
if
your
poor
father
driven
him
out
of
the
house
he
be
different
now
if
your
uncle
victor
had
kept
him
it
hard
for
poor
dan
if
he
ca
bring
his
friends
to
the
house
any
more
because
of
you
because
of
me
because
of
your
folly
she
understood
her
mother
believed
that
she
had
frightened
lindley
away
she
was
thinking
of
aunt
charlotte
it
would
have
been
all
right
if
she
could
have
told
her
about
nannie
then
mamma
would
have
seen
why
lindley
could
come
i
do
care
she
thought
she
may
think
what
she
likes
i
ca
tell
her
xi
lindley
vickers
had
gone
nothing
was
left
of
him
but
mamma
silence
and
dan
and
nannie
flush
as
she
slunk
by
and
her
obscene
smirk
of
satisfaction
then
nannie
forgot
him
as
if
nothing
had
happened
she
hung
about
yard
and
the
back
lane
waiting
for
young
horn
she
smiled
her
trusting
smile
again
as
long
as
you
lived
in
morfe
you
would
remember
mary
did
blame
her
mother
and
dan
for
their
awful
attitude
she
could
blink
the
fact
that
she
had
begun
to
care
for
a
man
who
was
no
better
than
young
horn
who
had
shown
her
that
he
did
care
for
her
by
going
to
nannie
if
he
could
go
to
nannie
he
was
no
better
than
young
horn
she
thought
of
lindley
communion
with
nannie
as
a
part
of
him
essential
enduring
beside
it
her
own
communion
with
him
was
not
quite
real
she
remembered
his
singing
she
remembered
playing
to
him
and
sitting
beside
him
on
the
bracken
as
you
remember
things
that
have
happened
to
you
a
long
time
ago
if
they
had
really
happened
she
remembered
phrases
broken
from
their
context
if
they
had
ever
had
a
context
das
man
vom
liebsten
was
man
hat
if
you
do
know
i
ca
tell
you
dear
and
when
when
then
you
wo
think
she
said
to
herself
i
must
have
been
mad
it
could
have
happened
i
must
have
made
it
up
but
if
you
made
up
things
like
that
you
mad
it
was
what
aunt
charlotte
had
done
she
had
lived
all
her
life
in
a
dream
of
loving
and
being
loved
a
dream
that
began
with
clergymen
and
ended
with
the
and
the
man
who
did
the
clocks
mamma
and
dan
knew
it
uncle
victor
knew
it
and
he
had
been
afraid
maurice
jourdain
knew
it
and
he
had
been
afraid
perhaps
lindley
vickers
knew
it
too
there
must
be
something
in
heredity
she
thought
if
there
is
i
rather
face
it
it
cowardly
not
to
lindley
vickers
had
told
her
what
to
read
herbert
spencer
she
knew
haeckel
and
ribot
were
in
the
london
library
catalogue
at
greffington
hall
and
maudsley
she
had
seen
the
name
somewhere
it
was
perhaps
lucky
that
sutcliffe
had
gone
abroad
early
this
year
for
he
had
begun
to
follow
her
through
balzac
and
flaubert
and
maupassant
since
when
he
had
sometimes
interfered
with
her
selection
the
books
came
down
in
two
days
herbert
spencer
the
of
the
of
of
maudsley
and
mind
physiology
and
pathology
of
mind
responsibility
in
mental
and
your
instinct
told
you
to
read
them
in
that
order
controlling
personal
curiosity
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
understood
what
spinoza
meant
by
the
intellectual
love
of
god
she
saw
how
all
things
work
together
for
good
to
those
who
in
spinoza
sense
love
god
if
it
had
been
for
aunt
charlotte
and
lindley
vickers
she
might
have
died
without
knowing
anything
about
the
exquisite
movements
and
connections
of
the
live
world
she
had
spent
most
of
her
time
in
the
passionate
pursuit
of
things
under
the
form
of
eternity
regardless
of
their
actual
behaviour
in
time
she
had
kept
on
for
fifteen
years
trying
to
find
out
the
reality
if
there
was
any
reality
that
hid
behind
appearances
piggishly
obtuse
to
the
interest
of
appearances
themselves
she
had
cared
for
nothing
in
them
but
their
beauty
and
its
exciting
play
on
her
emotions
when
life
brought
ugly
things
before
her
she
faced
them
with
a
show
of
courage
but
inwardly
she
was
sick
with
fear
for
the
first
time
she
saw
the
ugliest
facts
take
on
enchantment
a
secret
and
terrible
enchantment
mitchell
idiot
browne
girl
with
the
and
billing
her
shoulders
like
a
bird
there
was
something
in
heredity
but
the
sheer
interest
of
it
made
you
forget
about
papa
and
mamma
and
aunt
charlotte
it
kept
you
from
thinking
about
yourself
you
could
see
why
ribot
was
so
excited
about
his
laws
of
heredity
they
it
is
that
are
real
to
know
a
fact
thoroughly
is
to
know
the
quality
and
quantity
of
the
laws
that
compose
it
facts
are
but
appearances
laws
the
reality
there
was
darwin
origin
of
species
according
to
darwin
it
did
seem
likely
that
anything
so
useless
as
insanity
could
be
inherited
at
all
according
to
maudsley
and
ribot
it
seemed
even
less
likely
that
sanity
could
survive
to
be
sure
after
many
generations
insanity
was
stamped
out
but
not
before
it
had
run
its
course
through
imbecility
to
idiocy
infecting
more
generations
as
it
went
maudsley
was
solemn
and
exalted
in
his
desire
that
there
should
be
no
mistake
about
it
there
is
a
destiny
made
for
a
man
by
his
ancestors
and
no
one
can
elude
were
he
able
to
attempt
it
the
tyranny
of
his
organisation
you
had
been
wrong
all
the
time
you
had
thought
of
your
family
papa
and
mamma
perhaps
grandpapa
and
grandmamma
as
powerful
but
independent
and
separate
entities
in
themselves
sacred
and
inviolable
working
against
you
from
the
outside
either
with
open
or
secret
and
inscrutable
hostility
hindering
thwarting
crushing
you
down
but
always
from
the
outside
you
had
thought
of
yourself
as
a
somewhat
less
powerful
but
still
independent
and
separate
entity
a
sacred
inviolable
self
struggling
against
them
for
completer
freedom
and
detachment
crushed
down
but
always
getting
up
and
going
on
again
fighting
a
more
and
more
successful
battle
for
your
own
beating
them
in
the
end
but
it
was
not
so
there
were
no
independent
separate
entities
no
sacred
inviolable
selves
they
were
one
immense
organism
and
you
were
part
of
it
you
were
nothing
that
they
had
not
been
before
you
it
was
no
good
struggling
you
were
caught
in
the
net
you
could
get
out
and
so
were
they
mamma
and
papa
were
no
more
independent
and
separate
than
you
were
dan
had
gone
like
papa
but
papa
had
gone
like
grandpapa
and
grandmamma
olivier
nobody
ever
said
anything
about
grandpapa
olivier
so
perhaps
there
had
been
something
queer
about
him
anyhow
papa
could
help
drinking
any
more
than
mamma
could
help
being
sweet
and
gentle
they
had
had
a
choice
or
a
chance
how
senseless
you
had
been
with
your
old
angers
and
resentments
now
that
you
understood
you
could
never
feel
anger
or
resentment
any
more
as
long
as
you
lived
you
could
never
feel
anything
but
love
for
them
and
compassion
mamma
papa
and
aunt
charlotte
dan
and
roddy
they
were
caught
in
the
net
they
could
get
out
dan
and
roddy
but
mark
had
got
out
why
not
you
they
were
not
all
alike
papa
and
uncle
victor
were
different
and
aunt
charlotte
and
aunt
lavvy
papa
had
married
and
handed
it
on
he
cared
uncle
victor
had
married
he
had
cared
too
much
he
had
been
afraid
and
maurice
jourdain
and
lindley
vickers
had
been
afraid
everybody
who
knew
about
aunt
charlotte
would
be
afraid
and
if
they
did
know
you
would
have
to
tell
them
supposing
you
would
be
like
aunt
lavvy
you
would
live
in
morfe
with
mamma
for
years
and
years
as
aunt
lavvy
had
lived
with
grandmamma
first
you
would
be
like
dorsy
heron
then
like
louisa
wright
then
like
aunt
lavvy
no
when
you
were
you
would
go
like
aunt
charlotte
xii
anyhow
she
had
filled
in
the
time
between
october
and
march
when
the
sutcliffes
came
back
if
she
could
talk
to
somebody
about
it
but
you
could
talk
to
mamma
she
would
only
pretend
that
she
had
been
thinking
about
aunt
charlotte
at
all
if
mark
had
been
there
but
mark
was
there
and
dan
would
only
call
you
a
little
fool
aunt
lavvy
she
would
tell
you
to
love
god
even
aunt
charlotte
could
tell
you
that
she
could
see
aunt
charlotte
sitting
up
in
the
big
white
bed
and
saying
love
god
and
you
be
happy
as
she
scribbled
letters
to
marriott
and
hid
them
under
the
bedclothes
uncle
victor
uncle
victor
was
afraid
himself
charles
he
looked
at
you
as
he
used
to
look
at
roddy
perhaps
he
knew
about
aunt
charlotte
and
wondered
whether
you
would
go
like
her
or
if
he
did
wonder
he
would
only
give
you
the
iron
pills
and
arsenic
he
gave
to
dorsy
sutcliffe
you
could
tell
a
thing
like
that
to
sutcliffe
she
would
know
what
you
were
talking
about
or
if
she
did
know
she
would
gather
herself
up
spiritually
in
her
shawl
and
trail
away
sutcliffe
he
would
know
if
you
could
tell
him
you
might
take
back
maudsley
and
ribot
and
ask
him
if
he
knew
anything
about
heredity
and
what
he
thought
of
it
she
went
to
him
one
wednesday
afternoon
he
was
always
at
home
on
wednesday
afternoons
she
knew
how
it
would
be
sutcliffe
would
be
shut
up
in
the
with
the
you
would
go
in
you
would
knock
at
the
library
door
he
would
be
there
by
himself
in
the
big
smoking
and
reading
the
small
armchair
would
be
waiting
for
you
on
the
other
side
of
the
fireplace
he
would
be
looking
rather
old
and
tired
and
when
he
saw
you
he
would
jump
up
and
pull
himself
together
and
be
young
again
the
library
door
closed
softly
she
was
in
the
room
before
he
saw
her
he
was
older
and
more
tired
than
you
could
have
believed
he
stooped
in
his
chair
his
long
hands
rested
on
his
knees
slackly
as
they
had
dropped
there
grey
streaks
in
the
curly
lock
of
hair
that
fall
forward
and
be
a
whisker
his
mouth
had
tightened
and
hardened
it
held
out
it
refused
to
become
old
and
tired
it
mary
she
said
my
dear
he
dragged
himself
to
his
feet
making
his
body
very
straight
and
stiff
his
eyes
glistened
but
they
did
smile
only
his
eyelids
and
his
mouth
smiled
his
eyes
were
different
their
blue
was
shrunk
and
flattened
and
drawn
back
behind
the
lense
when
he
moved
pushing
forward
the
small
she
saw
how
lean
and
stiff
he
was
i
been
ill
he
said
oh
i
all
right
now
no
you
ought
to
have
come
back
from
agaye
i
never
do
what
i
ought
mary
she
remembered
how
beautiful
and
strong
he
used
to
be
when
he
danced
and
when
he
played
tennis
and
when
he
walked
up
and
down
the
hills
his
beauty
and
his
strength
had
never
moved
her
to
anything
but
a
happy
tranquil
admiration
she
remembered
how
she
had
seen
maurice
jourdain
tired
and
old
at
and
how
she
had
been
afraid
to
look
at
him
she
wondered
was
that
my
fault
or
his
if
i
cared
should
i
have
minded
if
i
cared
for
sutcliffe
i
would
mind
his
growing
tired
and
old
the
tireder
and
older
he
was
the
more
i
care
somehow
you
could
imagine
lindley
vickers
growing
old
and
tired
she
gave
him
back
the
books
ribot
and
and
pathology
of
he
held
them
in
his
long
thin
hands
reading
the
titles
his
strange
eyes
looked
at
her
over
the
tops
of
the
bindings
he
smiled
when
did
you
order
these
mary
in
october
that
the
sort
of
thing
you
do
when
i
away
is
it
yes
i
afraid
you
wo
care
for
them
very
much
he
still
stood
up
examining
the
books
he
was
dipping
into
maudsley
now
and
reading
him
you
do
mean
to
say
you
this
horrible
stuff
every
word
of
it
i
to
you
had
to
i
wanted
to
know
about
heredity
and
insanity
that
part
of
it
i
wanted
to
see
if
there
was
anything
in
it
heredity
i
mean
do
you
think
there
is
she
kept
her
eyes
on
him
he
was
still
smiling
my
dear
child
you
know
as
much
as
i
do
why
are
you
worrying
your
poor
little
head
about
madness
because
i
ca
help
thinking
i
may
go
mad
i
should
think
the
same
if
i
read
maudsley
i
should
be
quite
sure
whether
i
was
a
general
paralytic
or
an
epileptic
homicide
you
see
i
not
afraid
because
i
been
reading
him
i
been
reading
him
because
i
was
afraid
not
even
afraid
exactly
as
a
matter
of
fact
while
you
reading
about
it
you
so
interested
that
you
forget
about
yourself
it
only
when
you
finished
that
you
wonder
what
makes
you
wonder
he
threw
maudsley
aside
and
sat
down
in
the
big
armchair
that
just
what
i
do
think
i
can
tell
you
you
used
to
tell
me
things
mary
i
remember
a
little
girl
with
short
hair
who
asked
me
whether
cutting
off
her
hair
would
make
me
stop
caring
for
her
not
caring
for
precisely
so
if
you
ca
tell
me
who
you
tell
nobody
come
then
is
it
because
of
your
father
or
dan
she
thought
after
all
i
can
tell
him
no
not
exactly
but
it
somebody
one
of
papa
sisters
aunt
charlotte
you
see
mamma
seems
to
think
i
rather
like
her
does
aunt
charlotte
read
kant
and
hegel
and
schopenhauer
to
find
out
whether
the
is
mind
or
matter
does
she
read
maudsley
and
ribot
to
find
out
what
the
matter
with
her
mind
i
do
think
she
ever
read
anything
what
she
do
well
she
does
seem
to
have
done
much
but
fall
in
love
with
people
she
have
been
a
very
abnormal
lady
if
she
never
fallen
in
love
at
all
mary
yes
but
then
she
used
to
think
people
were
in
love
with
her
when
they
were
how
old
is
aunt
charlotte
she
must
be
ages
over
fifty
now
well
my
dear
you
just
and
i
do
think
you
been
in
love
yet
that
it
i
have
no
you
only
thought
you
were
once
twice
perhaps
you
may
have
been
very
near
it
for
ten
minutes
but
a
man
might
be
in
love
with
you
for
ten
years
and
you
would
be
a
bit
the
wiser
if
he
held
his
tongue
about
it
no
people
do
go
off
their
heads
because
their
aunts
do
or
we
should
all
of
us
be
mad
there
hardly
a
family
that
has
got
somebody
with
a
tile
loose
then
you
do
think
there
anything
in
it
i
do
think
there
anything
in
it
in
your
case
anything
at
all
i
glad
i
told
you
she
thought
it
is
so
bad
whatever
happens
he
be
here
xiii
the
had
broken
up
she
could
see
them
going
before
her
on
the
road
by
the
garden
wall
by
the
row
of
nine
in
the
field
round
the
curve
and
over
morfe
bridge
bobbing
shoulders
craning
necks
stiff
nodding
heads
in
funny
hats
turning
to
each
other
when
she
got
home
she
found
waugh
and
miss
frewin
in
the
with
mamma
they
had
brought
her
the
news
the
sutcliffes
were
going
they
were
trying
to
let
greffington
hall
the
agent
oldshaw
had
told
horn
frank
the
major
would
be
back
from
india
in
april
he
was
going
to
be
married
he
would
live
in
the
london
house
and
and
sutcliffe
would
live
abroad
mamma
said
if
their
son
coming
back
they
chosen
a
queer
time
to
go
away
xiv
it
could
be
true
you
knew
it
when
you
dined
with
them
when
you
saw
the
tranquil
regency
faces
looking
at
you
from
above
the
long
row
of
sheraton
chairs
the
pretty
gainsborough
lady
smiling
from
her
place
above
the
sideboard
as
you
sat
drinking
coffee
out
of
the
dark
blue
coffee
cups
with
gold
linings
you
knew
it
could
be
true
you
were
reassured
by
the
pattern
of
the
chintzes
pink
roses
and
green
leaves
on
a
ground
by
the
crystal
chains
and
pendants
of
the
chandelier
by
the
round
black
mirror
sunk
deep
in
the
bowl
of
its
gilt
frame
they
could
go
for
if
they
went
the
quiet
gentle
life
of
these
things
would
be
gone
the
room
had
no
soul
apart
from
the
two
utterly
beloved
figures
that
sat
there
each
in
its
own
chair
it
is
true
she
said
that
you
going
she
was
sitting
on
the
polar
bear
hearthrug
at
sutcliffe
feet
yes
mary
the
delicate
wrinkled
hand
came
out
from
under
the
cashmere
shawl
to
stroke
her
arm
it
kept
on
stroking
a
long
loving
slow
caress
it
made
her
queerly
aware
of
her
arm
white
and
slender
under
the
big
puff
of
the
sleeve
lying
across
sutcliffe
lap
he
be
happier
in
his
garden
at
agaye
she
heard
herself
assenting
be
happier
and
breaking
out
but
i
shall
never
be
happy
again
you
must
say
that
my
dear
the
hand
went
on
stroking
there
no
place
on
earth
she
said
where
i
so
happy
as
i
am
here
suddenly
the
hand
stopped
it
stiffened
it
drew
back
under
the
cashmere
shawl
she
turned
her
head
towards
sutcliffe
in
his
chair
on
the
other
side
of
the
hearthrug
his
face
had
a
queer
strained
look
his
eyes
were
fixed
fixed
on
the
white
slender
arm
that
lay
across
his
wife
lap
and
sutcliffe
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
queer
strained
face
xv
uncle
victor
letter
was
almost
a
relief
she
had
not
yet
allowed
herself
to
imagine
what
morfe
would
be
like
without
the
sutcliffes
and
after
all
they
would
have
to
live
in
it
if
dan
accepted
uncle
victor
offer
and
if
mamma
accepted
his
conditions
uncle
victor
left
no
doubt
as
to
his
conditions
he
would
take
dan
back
unless
mamma
left
morfe
and
made
a
home
for
him
in
london
he
wanted
them
all
to
live
together
at
five
elms
the
discussion
had
lasted
from
a
nine
till
ten
mamma
still
sat
at
the
crumpling
and
uncrumpling
the
letter
i
wish
i
knew
what
to
do
she
said
better
do
what
you
want
dan
said
stay
here
if
you
want
to
go
back
to
five
elms
if
you
want
to
but
for
god
sake
do
say
you
doing
it
on
my
account
he
got
up
and
went
out
of
the
room
goodness
knows
i
do
want
to
go
back
to
five
elms
but
i
wo
stand
in
dan
way
if
your
uncle
victor
thinks
i
ought
to
make
the
sacrifice
i
shall
make
it
and
dan
mary
said
will
make
the
sacrifice
of
going
back
to
office
it
would
be
simpler
if
he
went
to
canada
your
uncle
ca
help
him
to
go
to
canada
he
wo
hear
of
it
i
suppose
we
shall
have
to
go
they
were
going
you
could
hear
belk
buzzing
round
the
village
with
the
news
the
oliviers
are
going
one
day
belk
came
towards
her
busily
across
the
green
she
stopped
to
speak
while
her
little
eyes
glanced
off
sideways
as
if
they
saw
something
important
to
be
done
the
sutcliffes
were
not
going
after
all
xvi
when
it
was
all
settled
and
she
thought
that
dan
had
gone
into
reyburn
a
fortnight
ago
to
give
notice
to
the
landlord
solicitors
one
evening
as
she
was
coming
home
from
the
aldersons
he
told
her
that
he
been
to
the
solicitors
at
all
he
had
arranged
yesterday
for
his
transport
on
a
cattle
ship
sailing
next
week
for
montreal
he
said
he
had
always
meant
to
go
out
to
jem
alderson
when
he
had
learnt
enough
from
ned
then
why
she
said
did
you
let
mamma
tell
poor
victor
i
wanted
her
to
have
the
credit
of
the
sacrifice
he
said
and
then
i
do
like
leaving
you
here
an
awful
thought
came
to
her
are
you
sure
you
are
going
because
of
me
you
what
on
earth
are
you
thinking
of
that
time
when
you
would
ask
lindley
vickers
to
stop
on
oh
i
did
ask
him
because
i
knew
he
wanted
to
stop
altogether
and
i
do
approve
of
him
she
turned
and
stared
at
him
then
it
was
that
you
did
approve
of
what
put
that
in
your
head
mamma
she
told
me
you
could
ask
anybody
again
because
of
me
she
said
i
frightened
lindley
vickers
away
like
aunt
charlotte
dan
smiled
a
sombre
reminiscent
smile
you
do
mean
to
say
you
still
take
mamma
seriously
never
did
but
mark
or
him
either
it
hurt
her
like
some
abominable
blasphemy
xvii
nothing
would
ever
happen
she
would
stay
on
in
morfe
she
and
mamma
without
mark
without
dan
without
the
sutcliffes
they
were
going
they
were
gone
xxviii
i
she
lay
out
on
the
moor
under
the
august
sun
her
hands
were
pressed
like
a
bandage
over
her
eyes
when
she
lifted
them
she
caught
the
faint
pink
glow
of
their
flesh
the
light
throbbed
and
nickered
as
she
pressed
it
out
and
let
it
in
the
sheep
couched
panting
in
the
shade
of
the
stone
covers
she
lay
so
still
that
the
peewits
had
stopped
their
cry
something
bothered
her
in
the
east
one
pure
prophetic
one
pure
prophetic
star
between
the
darkness
and
the
what
you
wrote
last
year
no
reason
why
you
should
write
modern
plays
in
blank
verse
if
you
wanted
to
only
people
did
say
those
things
you
could
do
it
that
way
let
the
thing
go
tear
it
to
bits
and
burn
them
in
the
kitchen
fire
if
you
lay
still
perfectly
still
and
stopped
thinking
the
other
thing
would
come
back
dreams
he
has
made
you
wise
with
the
wisdom
of
silence
and
prayer
god
who
has
blinded
your
eyes
with
the
dusk
of
your
the
mother
the
mother
mother
and
son
and
he
are
near
akin
would
you
slay
your
what
he
does
yourself
shall
that
was
the
son
hereditary
destiny
lying
on
her
back
under
karva
she
dreamed
her
saying
the
unfinished
verses
over
and
over
again
so
as
to
remember
them
when
she
got
home
she
was
unutterably
happy
she

long
as
i
can
go
on
she
jumped
up
to
her
feet
i
must
go
and
see
what
mamma
doing
her
mother
was
sewing
in
the
and
waiting
for
her
to
come
to
tea
she
looked
up
and
smiled
what
are
you
so
pleased
about
she
said
oh

mamma
was
adorable
sitting
there
like
a
dove
on
its
nest
dressed
in
a
dove
dress
grey
on
grey
turning
dove
eyes
to
you
in
soft
crinkly
lids
she
held
her
head
on
one
side
smiling
at
some
secret
that
she
kept
mamma
was
happy
too
what
are
you
looking
such
an
angel
for
mamma
lifted
up
her
work
showing
an
envelope
that
lay
on
her
lap
the
crested
flap
upwards
a
blue
on
a
white
ground
and
the
motto
catty
had
been
into
reyburn
to
shop
and
had
called
for
the
letters
mark

coming
home
in
april

she
thought

she
never
be
afraid
he
get
cholera
for
a
minute
their
souls
met
and
burned
together
in
the
joy
they
shared
then
broke
apart
are
you
going
to
show
me
sutcliffe
letter
why
should
i
you
do
mean
to
say
there
anything
in
it
i
ca
see
you
can
see
it
if
you
like
there
nothing
in
it
that
was
why
she
had
wanted
her
to
see
it
for
anything
there
was
in
it
you
might
never
have
known
him
but
sutcliffe
had
sent
her
love
mamma
looked
up
sharply
did
you
write
to
him
mary
of
course
i
did
you
not
write
again
he
let
you
know
pretty
plainly
he
is
going
to
be
bothered
it
was
that
it
could
be
that
did
they
say
anything
more
about
your
going
there
no
that
ought
to
show
you
then
but
as
long
as
you
live
you
give
yourself
away
to
people
who
do
want
you
i
rather
you
did
talk
about
them
i
should
like
to
know
what
i
talk
about
said
mamma
she
folded
up
her
work
and
laid
it
in
the
basket
her
voice
dropped
from
the
sharp
note
of
resentment
i
wish
you
go
and
see
if
those
asters
have
come
ii
the
asters
had
come
she
had
carried
out
the
long
shallow
boxes
into
the
garden
she
had
left
her
mother
kneeling
beside
them
looking
with
adoration
into
the
large
round
innocent
faces
white
and
purple
mauve
and
magenta
and
amethyst
and
pink
if
the
asters
had
not
come
the
memory
of
the
awful
things
they
had
said
to
each
other
would
have
remained
with
them
till
but
mamma
would
be
happy
with
the
asters
like
a
child
with
its
toys
planning
where
they
were
to
go
and
planting
them
she
went
up
to
her
room
after
thirteen
years
she
had
still
the
same
childish
pleasure
in
the
thought
that
it
was
hers
and
could
be
taken
from
her
because
nobody
else
wanted
it
the
bookshelves
stretched
into
three
long
rows
on
the
white
wall
above
her
bed
to
hold
the
books
sutcliffe
had
given
her
a
light
blue
row
for
the
thomas
hardys
a
dark
blue
for
the
george
merediths
royal
blue
and
gold
for
the
rudyard
kiplings
and
in
the
narrow
upright
bookcase
in
the
arm
of
the
t
facing
her
mark
books
the
homers
and
the
greek
dramatists
their
backs
had
faded
from
puce
colour
to
drab
mark
when
she
looked
at
them
she
could
still
feel
her
old
childish
lust
for
possession
her
childish
sense
of
insecurity
of
defeat
and
something
else
the
beginning
of
thinking
things
about
mamma
she
could
see
herself
standing
in
mark
bedroom
at
five
elms
and
mamma
with
her
hands
on
mark
books
she
could
hear
herself
saying
afraid
what
did
i
think
mamma
was
afraid
of
mamma
was
happy
out
there
with
the
asters
there
would
be
three
hours
before
dinner
she
began
setting
down
the
fragments
of
the
that
had
come
to
her
then
the
outlines
she
saw
very
clearly
and
precisely
how
it
would
have
to
be
she
was
intensely
happy
she
was
still
thinking
of
it
as
she
went
across
the
green
to
the
post
office
instead
of
wondering
why
the
postmistress
had
sent
for
her
and
why
miss
horn
waited
for
her
by
the
house
door
at
the
side
or
why
she
looked
at
her
like
that
with
a
sort
of
yearning
pity
and
fear
she
followed
her
into
the
parlour
behind
the
post
office
suddenly
she
was
awake
to
the
existence
of
this
parlour
and
its
yellow
chairs
and
round
table
with
the
maroon
cloth
and
the
white
alabaster
lamp
that
smelt
the
orange
envelope
lay
on
the
maroon
cloth
miss
horn
covered
it
with
her
hand
it
for
dan
she
said
i
dare
send
it
to
the
house
lest
your
mother
should
get
it
she
gave
it
up
with
a
slow
unwilling
gesture
it
bad
news
miss
mary
brother
died
this
her
heart
stopped
staggered
and
went
on
again
poona
mark
brother
died
this
symonds
this
evening
was
yesterday
mark
had
died
yesterday
her
heart
stopped
again
she
had
a
sudden
feeling
of
suffocation
and
sickness
her
mind
left
off
following
the
sprawl
of
the
thick
letters
on
the
livid
pink
form
it
woke
again
to
the
extraordinary
existence
of
miss
horn
parlour
it
went
back
to
mark
slowly
by
the
way
it
had
come
by
the
smell
of
the
lamp
by
the
orange
envelope
on
the
maroon
cloth
mark
and
something
else
mamma
mamma
she
would
have
to
know
miss
horn
still
faced
her
supporting
herself
by
her
spread
hands
pressed
down
on
to
the
table
her
eyes
had
a
look
of
gentle
helpless
interrogation
as
if
she
said
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
she
did
all
the
necessary
things
asked
for
a
telegram
form
filled
it
in
mary
olivier
and
addressed
it
to
symonds
of
e
company
and
all
the
time
while
her
hand
moved
over
the
paper
she
was
thinking
i
shall
have
to
tell
mamma
iii
the
five
windows
of
the
house
stared
out
at
her
across
the
green
she
avoided
them
by
cutting
through
horn
yard
and
round
by
the
back
lane
into
the
orchard
she
was
afraid
that
her
mother
would
see
her
before
she
had
thought
how
she
would
tell
her
that
mark
was
dead
she
shut
herself
into
her
room
to
think
she
could
think
she
dragged
herself
from
the
window
seat
to
the
chair
by
the
and
from
the
chair
to
the
bed
she
could
still
feel
her
heart
staggering
and
stopping
once
she
thought
it
was
going
to
stop
altogether
she
had
a
sudden
pang
of
joy
if
it
would
stop
altogether
i
should
go
to
mark
nothing
would
matter
i
should
have
to
tell
mamma
that
he
dead
but
it
always
went
on
again
she
thought
of
mark
now
without
any
feeling
at
all
except
that
bodily
distress
her
mind
was
fixed
in
one
centre
of
burning
lucid
agony
mamma
i
ca
tell
her
i
ca
it
kill
her
i
do
see
how
she
to
live
if
mark
dead
i
shall
send
for
aunt
bella
she
can
do
it
or
i
might
ask
waugh
or
mr
rollitt
she
knew
she
would
do
any
of
these
things
she
would
have
to
tell
her
she
heard
the
clock
strike
the
half
hour
five
not
yet
when
it
strikes
seven
i
shall
go
and
tell
mamma
she
lay
down
on
her
bed
and
listened
for
the
strokes
of
the
clock
she
felt
nothing
but
an
immense
fatigue
an
appalling
heaviness
her
back
and
arms
were
loaded
with
weights
that
held
her
body
down
on
to
the
bed
i
shall
never
be
able
to
get
up
and
tell
her
six
at
seven
she
got
up
and
went
downstairs
through
the
open
side
door
she
saw
her
mother
working
in
the
garden
she
would
have
to
get
her
into
the
house
mamma
darling
but
mamma
would
come
in
she
was
planting
the
last
aster
in
the
row
she
went
on
scooping
out
the
hole
for
it
slowly
and
deliberately
with
her
trowel
and
patting
the
earth
about
it
with
wilful
hands
there
was
a
little
smudge
of
grey
earth
above
the
crinkles
in
her
soft
forehead
you
wait
she
said
she
smiled
like
a
child
pleased
with
itself
for
taking
its
own
way
mary
waited
she
thought
three
hours
ago
i
was
angry
with
her
i
was
angry
with
her
and
mark
was
dead
then
and
when
she
read
his
letter
he
was
dead
yesterday
iv
time
was
not
good
to
you
time
was
cruel
time
made
you
see
yet
somehow
they
had
gone
through
time
nights
of
august
and
september
when
you
got
up
before
daybreak
to
listen
at
her
door
days
when
you
did
nothing
mamma
sat
upright
in
her
chair
with
her
hands
folded
on
her
lap
she
kept
her
back
to
the
window
you
saw
her
face
darkening
in
the
dusk
when
the
lamp
came
she
raised
her
arm
and
the
black
shawl
hung
from
it
and
hid
her
face
nights
of
insane
fear
when
you
to
open
her
door
and
look
in
to
see
whether
she
were
alive
or
dead
days
when
you
were
afraid
to
speak
afraid
to
look
at
each
other
nights
when
you
sleep
for
wondering
how
mark
had
died
they
might
have
told
you
they
might
have
told
you
in
one
word
they
did
because
they
could
because
the
word
was
too
awful
they
would
never
say
how
mark
died
mamma
thought
he
had
died
of
cholera
you
started
at
sounds
at
the
hiss
of
the
flame
in
the
grate
the
fall
of
the
ashes
on
the
hearth
the
tinkling
of
the
front
door
bell
you
heard
catty
slide
back
the
bolt
people
muttered
on
the
doorstep
you
saw
them
go
back
past
the
window
quietly
their
heads
turned
away
they
were
ashamed
you
began
to
go
out
you
walked
slowly
weighted
more
than
ever
by
your
immense
inexplicable
fatigue
when
you
saw
people
coming
you
tried
to
go
quicker
when
you
spoke
to
them
you
panted
and
felt
absurd
a
coldness
came
over
you
when
you
saw
waugh
and
miss
frewin
with
their
heads
on
one
side
and
their
shocked
grieved
faces
you
smiled
at
them
as
you
panted
but
they
would
smile
back
their
grief
was
too
great
they
would
never
get
over
it
you
began
to
watch
for
the
indian
mail
one
day
the
letter
came
you
read
blunt
jerky
sentences
that
told
you
mark
had
died
suddenly
in
the
mess
room
of
heart
failure
captain
symonds
said
he
thought
you
would
want
to
know
exactly
how
it
happened
well
we
were
if
you
know
what
that
is
after
dinner
peters
is
the
heaviest
man
in
our
battery
and
major
olivier
was
carrying
him
on
his
back
we
ought
to
have
let
him
do
it
but
we
did
know
there
was
anything
wrong
with
his
heart
he
know
it
himself
we
thought
he
was
fooling
when
he
dropped
on
the
floor
everything
was
done
that
could
be
done
he
could
have
suffered
he
was
happy
up
to
the
last
minute
of
his
life
shouting
with
laughter
she
saw
the
long
lighted
room
she
saw
it
with
yellow
walls
and
yellow
lights
with
a
long
white
table
and
clear
empty
men
in
bamboo
armchairs
turning
round
to
look
she
could
see
their
faces
she
saw
mark
face
she
heard
mark
voice
shouting
with
laughter
she
saw
mark
lying
dead
on
the
floor
the
men
stood
up
suddenly
somebody
without
a
face
knelt
down
and
bent
over
him
it
was
as
if
she
had
never
known
before
that
mark
was
dead
and
knew
it
now
she
cried
for
the
first
time
since
his
death
not
because
he
was
dead
but
because
he
had
died
like
that
playing
he
should
have
died
fighting
why
could
he
there
was
the
boer
war
and
the
khyber
pass
and
chitral
and
the
soudan
he
had
missed
them
all
he
had
never
had
what
he
had
wanted
and
mamma
who
had
cried
so
much
had
left
off
crying
the
poor
man
could
have
liked
writing
that
letter
mary
you
be
angry
with
him
i
not
angry
with
him
i
angry
because
mark
died
like
that
the
sound
in
her
mother
throat
was
like
a
sigh
and
a
sob
and
a
laugh
jerking
out
contempt
you
do
know
what
you
talking
about
he
gone
mary
if
you
were
his
mother
it
would
matter
to
you
how
he
died
so
long
as
he
suffer
so
long
as
he
did
die
of
cholera
if
he
could
have
got
what
he
wanted
what
that
you
say
if
he
could
have
got
what
he
wanted
none
of
us
ever
get
what
we
want
in
this
world
said
mamma
she
thought
it
was
her
son
son
she
loved
not
mark
real
secret
self
he
got
away
from
her
at
last
altogether
she
sewed
every
day
she
went
to
the
linen
cupboard
and
gathered
up
all
the
old
towels
and
sheets
that
wanted
mending
and
she
sewed
her
mother
had
a
book
in
her
lap
she
noticed
that
if
she
left
off
sewing
mamma
would
take
up
the
book
and
read
and
when
she
began
again
she
would
put
it
down
her
thoughts
went
from
mamma
to
mark
from
mark
to
mamma
she
used
to
be
pleased
when
she
saw
you
sewing
nothing
will
ever
please
her
now
she
never
be
happy
again
i
ought
to
have
died
instead
of
mark
that
anthony
trollope
she
reading
the
long
sheet
kept
slipping
it
dragged
on
her
arm
her
arms
felt
swollen
and
heavy
like
bars
of
lead
she
let
them
drop
to
her
knees
little
mamma
she
picked
up
the
sheet
again
why
are
you
sewing
mary
i
must
do
why
do
you
take
a
book
and
read
i
ca
read
well
why
do
you
go
out
for
a
walk
too
tired
you
better
go
and
lie
down
in
your
room
she
hated
her
room
everything
in
it
reminded
her
of
the
day
after
mark
died
the
rows
of
new
books
reminded
her
and
mark
books
in
the
narrow
bookcase
they
were
hers
she
would
never
be
asked
to
give
them
back
again
yesterday
she
had
taken
out
the
aeschylus
and
looked
at
it
and
she
had
forgotten
that
mark
was
dead
and
had
felt
glad
because
it
was
hers
she
had
been
afraid
to
see
its
shabby
drab
back
lest
it
should
remind
her
of
that
too
her
mother
sighed
and
put
her
book
away
she
sat
with
her
hands
before
her
waiting
her
face
had
its
old
look
of
reproach
and
disapproval
the
drawn
irritated
look
you
saw
when
you
came
between
her
and
mark
as
if
your
grief
for
mark
came
between
her
and
her
grief
as
if
deep
down
inside
her
she
hated
your
grief
as
she
had
hated
your
love
for
him
without
knowing
that
she
hated
it
suddenly
she
turned
on
you
her
blurred
wounded
eyes
mary
when
you
look
at
me
like
that
i
feel
as
if
you
knew
everything
thinking
i
do
i
shall
never
know
supposing
all
the
time
she
knew
what
you
were
thinking
supposing
mark
knew
supposing
the
dead
knew
she
was
glad
of
the
aching
of
her
heart
that
dragged
her
thought
down
and
numbed
it
the
january
twilight
crept
between
them
she
put
down
her
sewing
at
the
stroke
of
the
clock
her
mother
stirred
in
her
chair
what
day
of
the
month
is
it
she
said
the
then
yesterday
was
your
birthday
poor
mary
i
forgot
i
sit
here
thinking
my
own
thoughts
they
make
me
forget
come
here
she
went
to
her
drawn
by
a
passion
stronger
than
her
passion
for
mark
her
hard
proud
passion
for
mark
her
mother
put
up
her
face
she
stooped
down
and
kissed
her
passionately
on
her
mouth
her
wet
cheeks
her
dove
eyes
her
dove
eyelids
she
crouched
on
the
floor
beside
her
leaning
her
head
against
her
lap
mamma
hand
held
it
there
are
you

you
do
look
it
you
always
been
such
a
little
thing
you
remember
the
silly
question
you
used
to
ask
me
would
you
love
me
better
if
i
was
two
she
remembered
long
ago
when
she
came
teasing
for
kisses
the
silly
question
you
remember
yes
i
remember
deep
down
inside
her
there
was
something
you
would
never
know
xxix
mamma
was
planting
another
row
of
asters
in
the
garden
in
the
place
of
those
that
had
died
last
september
the
outline
of
the
map
of
south
africa
had
gone
from
the
wall
at
the
bottom
roddy
bit
was
indistinguishable
from
the
rest
and
always
you
knew
what
would
happen
outside
on
the
green
the
movements
of
the
village
repeated
themselves
like
the
play
of
a
toy
always
the
same
figures
on
the
same
painted
stand
marked
with
the
same
pattern
of
slanting
roads
and
through
prayers
the
morfe
bus
would
break
loose
from
high
row
with
a
clatter
and
the
brakes
would
grind
on
the
hill
an
hour
after
it
would
come
back
with
a
mournful
tapping
and
scraping
of
hoofs
she
had
left
off
watching
for
the
old
red
to
come
round
the
corner
at
the
bottom
sometimes
at
long
intervals
there
would
be
a
letter
for
her
from
aunt
lavvy
or
dan
or
sutcliffe
she
tell
when
it
would
come
but
she
knew
on
what
days
the
long
trolleys
would
stop
by
horn
yard
loaded
with
powdery
sacks
of
flour
and
on
what
days
the
brewer
van
would
draw
up
to
the
king
head
and
the
farmers
arms
when
she
looked
out
across
the
green
she
caught
the
hard
stare
of
the
belks
house
the
tall
lean
grey
house
blotched
with
iron
stains
it
stood
on
the
sheer
edge
where
the
platform
dropped
to
the
turn
of
the
road
every
morning
at
ten
its
little
door
would
open
and
belk
would
come
out
and
watch
for
his
london
paper
every
evening
at
ten
minutes
past
ten
the
shadow
of
belk
would
move
across
the
yellow
blind
of
the
window
on
the
right
the
light
would
go
out
and
presently
a
blond
blur
would
appear
behind
the
blind
of
the
bedroom
window
on
the
left
every
morning
at
twelve
belk
would
hurry
along
waddling
and
shaking
to
leave
the
paper
with
her
aunt
old
heron
in
the
dark
cottage
that
crouched
at
the
top
of
the
green
every
afternoon
at
three
dorsy
would
bring
it
back
again
when
mary
came
in
from
the
village
mamma
would
look
up
and
say
well
as
if
she
expected
her
to
have
something
interesting
to
tell
she
wished
that
something
would
happen
so
that
she
might
tell
mamma
about
it
she
tried
to
think
of
something
something
to
say
that
would
interest
mamma
i
met
james
on
the
garthdale
road
walking
like
anything
did
you
mamma
was
not
interested
in
james
she
wondered
why
ca
i
think
of
things
like
other
people
she
had
a
sense
of
defeat
of
mournful
incapacity
one
day
catty
came
bustling
in
with
the
looking
important
she
had
brought
news
from
the
village
heron
had
broken
her
thigh
she
had
slipped
on
the
landing
belk
was
with
her
and
would
go
away
catty
tried
to
look
sorry
but
you
could
see
she
was
pleased
because
she
had
something
to
tell
you
they
talked
about
it
all
through
they
were
sorry
for
heron
they
wondered
what
poor
dorsy
would
do
if
anything
should
happen
to
her
and
through
all
their
sorrow
there
ran
a
delicate
secret
thrill
of
satisfaction
something
had
happened
something
that
interested
mamma
two
days
later
dorsy
came
in
with
her
tale
her
nose
was
redder
her
hare
eyes
were
frightened
belk
there
still
she
said
she
wants
to
take
aunt
to
live
with
her
she
wants
her
to
send
me
away
she
says
it
would
have
happened
if
i
looked
after
her
properly
and
so
it
would
mary
if
i
been
there
but
i
a
bad
headache
and
i
was
lying
down
for
a
minute
when
she
fell
she
wo
go
she
sitting
there
in
aunt
room
all
the
time
talking
and
tiring
her
trying
to
poison
aunt
mind
against
me
working
on
her
to
send
me
away
dorsy
voice
dropped
and
her
face
reddened
she
thinks
i

aunt

afraid
of
her
leaving
it
to
me
i
only
her
husband
nephew

of
her
and
she
ca

away
from
her
she
just
lies
there
with
her
poor
leg
in
the
splints
there
the
weight
from
the
kitchen
scales
tied
on
to
keep
it
on
the
stretch
if
you
could
see
her
eyes
turning
to
me
when
i
come
one
thing
belk
afraid
for
her
life
of
me
that
why
trying
to
poison
aunt
mind
when
they
saw
belk
hurrying
across
the
green
to
heron
house
they
knew
what
she
was
going
for
poor
dorsy
they
said
poor
dorsy
they
had
something
to
talk
to
each
other
about
now
ii
winter
and
spring
passed
the
flowered
on
greffington
edge
dim
white
groves
magically
still
under
the
grey
glassy
air
may
passed
and
june
the
sleek
waves
of
the
shone
with
the
brushing
of
the
wind
ready
for
mowing
the
elder
tree
by
the
garden
wall
was
a
froth
of
greenish
white
on
green
at
the
turn
of
the
schoolhouse
lane
the
flowers
began
wild
geraniums
and
rose
campion
purple
and
blue
and
magenta
in
a
white
spray
of
parsley
standing
high
against
the
stone
walls
up
and
up
the
green
lane
down
there
where
the
two
dales
spread
out
at
the
bottom
a
tiny
dutch
landscape
flat
pastures
trees
dotted
about
a
stiff
row
of
trees
at
the
end
no
sky
behind
them
trees
green
on
green
not
green
on
blue
the
great
flood
of
the
sky
dammed
off
by
the
hills
she
shut
her
eyes
and
saw
the
flat
fields
of
ilford
and
the
low
line
of
flying
trees
a
thin
watery
mirage
against
the
hill
since
mark
died
she
had
begun
to
dream
about
ilford
she
would
struggle
and
break
through
out
of
some
dream
about
morfe
and
find
herself
in
ley
street
going
to
five
elms
she
would
get
past
the
corner
and
see
the
red
brick
gable
end
sometimes
when
she
came
up
to
the
gate
the
house
would
turn
into
greffington
hall
sometimes
it
would
stand
firm
with
its
three
rows
of
flat
windows
she
would
go
up
the
flagged
path
and
see
the
sumach
tree
growing
by
the
pantry
window
and
when
the
door
was
opening
she
would
wake
sometimes
the
door
stood
open
she
would
go
in
she
would
go
up
the
stairs
and
down
the
passages
trying
to
find
the
schoolroom
she
would
know
that
mark
was
in
the
schoolroom
but
she
could
never
find
it
she
never
saw
mark
the
passages
led
through
empty
rooms
to
the
bottom
of
the
kitchen
stairs
and
she
would
find
a
dead
baby
lying
among
the
boots
and
shoes
in
the
cat
cupboard
autumn
and
winter
passed
she
was
iii
when
your
mind
stopped
and
stood
still
it
could
feel
time
time
going
fast
going
faster
and
faster
every
year
its
rhythm
swung
on
a
longer
curve
your
mind
stretched
to
the
span
of
time
there
was
something
exciting
about
this
stretch
like
a
new
sense
growing
but
in
your
dreams
your
mind
shrank
again
you
were
a
child
a
child
remembering
and
returning
haunting
old
stairs
and
passages
knocking
at
shut
doors
this
child
tried
to
drag
you
back
it
teased
you
to
make
rhymes
about
it
you
were
not
happy
till
you
had
made
the
rhymes
there
was
something
in
you
that
went
on
that
refused
to
turn
back
to
look
for
happiness
in
memory
your
happiness
was
in
the
moment
that
you
lived
while
you
made
rhymes
while
you
looked
at
the
white
while
the
cloud
passed
over
karva
yesterday
she
had
said
to
dorsy
heron
what
i
ca
stand
is
seeing
the
same
faces
every
day
but
the
hill
world
had
never
the
same
face
for
five
minutes
its
very
form
changed
as
the
roads
turned
the
swing
of
your
stride
put
in
play
a
vast
mysterious
that
disturbed
the
sky
moving
through
it
you
stood
still
in
the
heart
of
an
immense
being
that
moved
standing
still
you
were
moved
you
were
drawn
nearer
and
nearer
to
its
enclosing
heart
she
swung
off
the
road
beyond
the
sickle
to
the
last
that
led
to
the
other
side
of
karva
she
came
back
by
the
southern
slope
down
the
twelve
fields
past
the
four
farms
the
farm
of
the
the
farm
of
the
ash
the
farm
of
the
three
firs
and
the
farm
all
alone
four
houses
four
tales
to
be
written
there
was
something
in
you
that
would
go
on
whatever
happened
whatever
happened
it
would
still
be
happy
its
happiness
was
not
like
the
queer
sudden
uncertain
ecstasy
she
had
never
known
that
was
it
came
and
went
it
had
gone
so
long
ago
that
she
was
sure
that
whatever
it
had
been
it
would
never
come
again
she
could
only
remember
its
happening
as
you
remember
the
faint
ecstasies
of
dreams
she
thought
of
it
as
something
strange
and
exciting
sometimes
she
wondered
whether
it
had
really
happened
whether
there
was
a
sort
of
untruthfulness
in
supposing
it
had
but
that
ecstasy
and
this
happiness
had
one
quality
in
common
they
belonged
to
some
part
of
you
that
was
free
a
you
that
had
no
hereditary
destiny
that
had
got
out
of
the
net
or
had
never
been
caught
in
it
you
could
stand
aside
and
look
on
at
its
happiness
with
horror
it
care
it
was
utterly
indifferent
to
your
praise
or
blame
and
the
praise
or
blame
of
other
people
or
to
your
happiness
and
theirs
it
was
open
to
you
to
own
it
as
your
self
or
to
detach
yourself
from
it
in
your
horror
it
was
stronger
and
saner
than
you
if
you
chose
to
set
up
that
awful
conflict
in
your
soul
that
was
your
own
affair
perhaps
not
your
own
supposing
the
conflict
in
you
was
the
tug
of
the
generations
before
you
trying
to
drag
you
back
to
them
supposing
the
horror
was
horror
their
fear
of
defeat
she
had
left
off
being
afraid
of
what
might
happen
to
her
it
might
never
happen
and
supposing
it
did
supposing
it
had
to
happen
when
you
were
you
had
still
thirteen
years
to
write
in
it
sha
happen
i
wo
let
it
i
wo
let
them
beat
me
iv
last
year
the
drawer
in
the
was
full
this
year
it
had
overflowed
into
the
top
drawer
of
the
she
had
to
turn
out
all
the
handkerchiefs
and
stockings
her
mother
met
her
as
she
was
carrying
them
to
the
wardrobe
in
the
spare
room
you
could
see
she
felt
that
there
was
something
here
that
must
be
enquired
into
i
should
have
thought
she
said
that
drawer
was
enough
it
is
mamma
nodded
her
head
in
a
sort
of
exasperated
resignation
do
you
mean
to
say
you
going
to
all
that
all
that
you
should
see
what
i
burnt
i
should
like
to
know
what
you
going
to
do
with
it
so
should
i
that
just
it
i
do
know
that
night
the
monstrous
thought
came
to
her
in
bed
supposing
i
published
those
poems
i
always
meant
to
do
it
some
day
why
have
i
because
i
do
care
or
because
i
care
too
much
because
i
afraid
afraid
that
if
somebody
reads
them
the
illusion
they
created
would
be
gone
how
do
i
know
my
writing
is
like
my
playing
this
is
different
there
nothing
else
if
it
taken
from
me
i
want
to
go
on
living
you
did
want
to
go
on
living
when
mark
died
yet
you
went
on
as
if
mark
had
never
died
and
if
mamma
died
you
go
on
in
your
illusion
if
it
is
an
illusion
i
rather
know
it
how
i
know
there
is
anybody
here
who
can
tell
me
nobody
you
could
believe
if
they
told
you
i
can
believe
i
burnt
everything
i
written
that
was
bad
you
believe
yourself
you
believed
yesterday
how
do
you
know
you
believe
aunt
lavvy
had
come
to
stay
when
she
came
you
had
the
old
feeling
of
something
interesting
about
to
happen
only
you
knew
now
that
this
was
an
illusion
she
talked
to
you
as
though
instead
of
being
you
were
still
very
small
and
very
young
and
ignorant
of
all
the
things
that
really
mattered
she
was
vaguer
and
greyer
more
placid
than
ever
and
more
content
with
god
impossible
to
believe
that
papa
used
to
bully
her
and
that
aunt
lavvy
had
revolted
for
years
emilius
years
sunday
supper
at
five
elms
on
the
table
james
martineau
after
the
christian
she
wondered
why
she
had
thought
of
aunt
lavvy
aunt
lavvy
knew
martineau
as
long
as
you
could
remember
she
had
always
given
a
strong
impression
of
knowing
him
quite
well
but
when
mary
had
made
it
clear
what
she
wanted
her
to
ask
him
to
do
it
turned
out
that
aunt
lavvy
did
know
martineau
at
all
and
you
could
see
she
thought
you
presumptuous
vi
when
old
martha
brought
the
message
for
her
to
go
to
tea
with
miss
kendal
mary
slunk
out
through
the
orchard
into
the
back
lane
at
that
moment
the
prospect
of
talking
two
hours
with
miss
kendal
was
unendurable
and
there
was
no
other
prospect
as
long
as
she
lived
in
morfe
there
would
be
nothing
apart
from
her
real
secret
life
there
would
be
nothing
to
look
forward
to
but
that
if
it
was
not
miss
kendal
it
would
be
miss
louisa
or
dorsy
or
old
heron
people
talked
about
dying
of
boredom
who
did
know
that
you
could
really
die
of
it
if
only
you
did
keep
on
wanting
somebody
somebody
who
was
there
if
before
it
killed
you
you
could
kill
the
desire
to
know
another
mind
a
luminous
fiery
crystal
to
see
it
turn
shining
and
flashing
to
talk
to
it
to
listen
to
it
to
love
the
human
creature
it
belonged
to
she
envied
her
youth
its
capacity
for
for
imagining
interminable
communions
brilliant
hallucinations
of
a
mental
hunger
better
than
nothing
if
this
went
on
the
must
come
suddenly
you
would
go
smash
smash
your
mind
would
die
in
a
delirium
of
hunger
vii
it
a
pity
we
ca
go
to
his
lecture
said
miss
kendal
the
train
was
moving
out
of
reyburn
station
it
was
awful
to
think
how
nearly
they
had
missed
it
if
charles
had
stayed
another
minute
at
the
miss
kendal
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
seat
very
upright
in
her
black
silk
mantle
with
the
chiffon
frills
she
had
sat
like
that
since
the
train
began
to
pull
ready
to
get
out
the
instant
it
stopped
at
durlingham
i
feel
sure
it
going
to
be
all
right
she
said
the
white
marabou
feather
nodded
her
gentle
mauve
and
sallow
face
was
growing
old
with
soft
curdlings
and
puckerings
of
the
skin
but
she
still
carried
her
head
high
nodding
at
you
with
her
air
of
gaiety
of
ineffable
intrigue
i
would
bring
you
mary
if
i
did
feel
sure
if
she
had
not
felt
sure
she
would
have
put
on
the
grey
kid
gloves
the
mantle
and
the
bonnet
with
the
white
marabou
feather
you
do
dress
like
that
to
go
shopping
in
durlingham
you
mean
mary
said
that
we
shall
see
him
her
heart
beat
calmly
stilled
by
the
sheer
incredibility
of
the
adventure
of
course
we
shall
see
him
will
manage
that
it
might
have
been
a
little
difficult
if
the
professor
had
been
staying
anywhere
else
but
i
know
very
well
no
doubt
arranged
for
you
to
have
a
long
talk
with
him
does
she
know
what
i
want
to
see
him
about
well
yes
i
thought
it
best
my
dear
to
tell
her
just
what
you
told
me
so
that
she
might
see
how
important
it
is
there
no
knowing
what
may
come
of
it
did
you
bring
them
with
you
no
i
did
if
he
wo
look
at
them
i
should
feel
such
an
awful
fool
perhaps
said
miss
kendal
it
is
wiser
not
to
assume
beforehand
nothing
may
come
of
it
still
i
ca
help
feeling
something
will
when
you
famous
mary
i
shall
think
of
how
we
went
into
durlingham
together
whatever
comes
of
it
i
shall
think
of
the
marabou
feather
quivered
slightly
how
long
have
we
known
each
other
seventeen
years
is
it
so
long
i
shall
never
forget
the
first
day
you
came
with
your
mother
i
can
see
you
now
mary
sitting
beside
my
poor
father
with
your
hand
on
his
chair
and
that
evening
when
you
played
to
us
and
dear
roddy
was
there
she
thought
why
ca
i
be
kind
always
kindness
matters
more
than
anything
some
day
she
die
and
she
never
have
said
or
thought
one
unkind
thing
in
all
her
poor
dreadful
little
life
why
did
i
go
to
tea
with
her
on
wednesday
on
wednesday
her
mind
had
revolted
against
its
destiny
of
hunger
she
had
hated
morfe
she
had
felt
angry
with
her
mother
for
making
her
live
in
it
for
expecting
her
to
be
content
for
thinking
that
dorsy
and
miss
louisa
and
miss
kendal
were
enough
she
had
been
angry
with
aunt
lavvy
for
talking
about
her
to
miss
kendal
yet
if
it
were
for
miss
kendal
she
would
be
going
into
durlingham
to
see
professor
lee
ramsden
inconceivable
that
she
should
be
taken
by
miss
kendal
to
see
professor
lee
ramsden
yet
this
inconceivable
thing
appeared
to
be
happening
she
tried
to
remember
what
she
knew
about
him
he
was
professor
of
english
literature
at
the
university
of
london
he
had
edited
anthologies
and
written
introductions
he
had
written
a
of
english
from
chaucer
to
tennyson
and
a
monograph
on
shelley
she
thought
of
his
mind
as
a
luminous
fiery
crystal
shining
posters
on
the
platform
at
durlingham
announced
in
red
letters
that
professor
lee
ramsden
would
lecture
in
the
town
hall
at
she
heard
miss
kendal
saying
if
it
had
been
at
three
instead
of
eight
we
could
have
gone
she
had
a
supreme
sense
of
something
about
to
happen
heavenly
the
long
glass
roof
of
the
station
the
iron
arches
and
girders
the
fanlights
foreign
and
beautiful
the
black
canal
between
the
purplish
walls
the
white
swans
swaying
on
the
black
water
the
red
shaft
of
the
it
shot
up
high
out
of
the
topped
with
the
fantastically
large
round
white
eye
of
its
clock
she
kept
on
looking
up
to
the
at
four
she
would
see
him
they
walked
about
the
town
they
lunched
and
shopped
they
sat
in
the
park
they
kept
on
looking
at
the
at
the
bookseller
in
the
she
bought
a
copy
of
walt
whitman
of
a
drive
between
bushes
of
smutty
laurel
and
arbutus
a
house
of
big
cut
stones
that
stuck
out
gables
and
bow
windows
with
sharp
freestone
facings
that
stuck
out
you
waited
in
a
stuffed
with
fragile
mahogany
and
plush
immense
acanthus
leaves
shaded
in
myrtle
green
curled
out
from
the
walls
a
suggestion
of
pictures
heaved
up
from
their
places
by
this
vigorous
thrusting
growth
curtains
net
plush
veiled
the
walks
and
smutty
lawns
of
the
garden
while
she
contemplated
these
things
the
long
hand
of
the
white
marble
tombstone
clock
moved
from
the
hour
to
the
quarter
she
was
reading
the
inscription
in
black
letters
on
the
golden
plinth
presented
to
thomas
by
the
council
and
teachers
of
paul
schools
durlingham
presented
when
came
in
a
foolish
overblown
conceited
face
grey
hair
arranged
with
art
and
science
curl
on
curl
eyelids
hutches
for
small
malevolently
watching
eyes
a
sharp
insolent
nose
fish
mouth
peering
out
above
the
backward
slope
of
cascading
chins
shook
hands
at
a
sidelong
not
looking
at
you
holding
miss
kendal
in
her
sharp
pointed
stare
they
were
kate
and
eleanor
eleanor
and
kate
you
going
to
the
lecture
if
it
had
been
at
three
instead
of
eight
the
hour
was
fixed
for
the
townspeople
convenience
in
five
minutes
you
had
gathered
that
you
would
not
be
allowed
to
see
professor
lee
ramsden
that
professor
lee
ramsden
did
not
desire
to
see
or
talk
to
anybody
except
that
he
kept
his
best
things
for
her
that
sorts
of
were
trying
to
get
at
him
and
that
he
trusted
her
to
protect
him
from
invasion
that
you
had
been
admitted
in
order
that
might
have
the
pleasure
of
telling
you
these
things
mary
saw
that
the
moment
was
atrocious
but
it
did
matter
a
curious
tranquillity
possessed
her
she
felt
something
there
close
to
her
like
a
person
in
the
room
giving
her
a
sudden
security
the
moment
that
was
mattering
so
abominably
to
her
poor
kind
friend
belonged
to
a
time
that
was
not
her
time
she
heard
the
tinkle
of
tea
cups
outside
the
hall
then
a
male
voice
male
footsteps
made
a
large
encircling
movement
towards
the
door
something
interceptive
took
place
there
as
they
went
back
down
the
drive
between
the
laurel
and
arbutus
miss
kendal
carried
her
head
higher
than
ever
that
is
the
first
time
in
my
life
mary
that
i
asked
a
favour
you
did
it
for
me
she
hated
it
but
she
did
it
for
me
never
mind
we
are
going
to
mind
are
we
we
do
without
them
that
right
my
dear
laugh
i
glad
you
can
i
dare
say
i
shall
laugh
myself
i
do
to
laugh
mary
said
she
could
have
cried
when
she
looked
at
the
grey
gloves
and
the
frilled
mantle
and
the
sad
insulted
face
in
the
bonnet
with
the
white
marabou
feather
and
that
horrible
woman
had
even
given
her
tea
the
enormous
eye
of
the
town
clock
pursued
them
to
the
station
as
they
settled
into
their
seats
in
the
reyburn
train
miss
kendal
said
it
a
pity
we
could
go
to
the
lecture
she
leaned
back
tired
in
her
corner
she
closed
her
eyes
mary
opened
walt
whitman
of
the
beginning
had
begun
xxx
i
what
are
you
reading
mary
the
new
testament
extraordinary
how
interesting
it
is
interesting
frightfully
interesting
you
may
say
what
you
like
mary
you
change
your
mind
some
day
i
pray
every
night
that
you
may
come
to
christ
and
you
find
in
the
end
you
have
to
come
no
no
still
he
said
the
kingdom
of
god
is
within
you
if
the
greek
would
bear
it
within
you
did
they
understand
their
christ
had
anybody
ever
understood
him
their
prince
of
peace
who
said
he
had
come
to
send
peace
but
a
sword
the
sword
of
the
self
he
said
he
had
come
to
set
a
man
against
his
father
and
the
daughter
against
her
mother
and
that
because
of
him
a
man
foes
should
be
those
of
his
own
household
gentle
jesus
meek
and
mild
he
was
not
meek
and
mild
he
was
only
gentle
with
children
and
women
and
sick
people
he
was
brave
and
proud
and
impatient
and
ironic
he
stay
with
his
father
and
mother
he
liked
happy
people
who
could
amuse
themselves
without
boring
him
he
liked
to
get
away
from
his
disciples
and
from
lazarus
and
martha
and
mary
of
bethany
and
go
to
the
rich
cosmopolitan
houses
and
hear
the
talk
and
see
the
young
roman
captains
swaggering
with
their
swords
and
making
eyes
at
mary
of
magdala
he
was
the
sublimest
rebel
that
ever
lived
he
said
the
spirit
blows
where
it
wills
you
hear
the
sound
of
it
but
you
ca
tell
where
it
comes
from
or
where
it
goes
to
everybody
that
is
born
from
the
spirit
is
like
that
the
spirit
blows
where
it
wants
to
he
said
it
was
a
good
thing
for
them
that
he
was
going
away
if
he
the
holy
ghost
would
come
to
them
they
would
never
have
any
real
selves
they
would
never
be
free
they
would
set
him
up
as
a
god
outside
themselves
and
worship
him
and
forget
that
the
kingdom
of
god
was
within
them
that
god
was
their
real
self
their
hidden
self
was
god
it
was
their
saviour
its
existence
was
the
hushed
secret
of
the
world
christ
knew
he
must
have
known
it
was
greater
than
he
was
it
was
a
good
thing
for
them
that
christ
died
that
was
how
he
saved
them
by
going
away
by
a
proud
brave
ironic
death
not
at
all
the
sort
of
death
you
had
been
taught
to
believe
in
and
because
they
could
understand
a
death
like
that
they
went
and
made
a
god
of
him
just
the
same
but
the
atonement
was
that
christ
going
away

on

pressing
them
down
on

up

as

over

stirred
by

stretchings
and

of

steam
then
the
whole
mass
coming
down

grey

she
came
down
the
twelve
fields
on
the
south
slope
of
karva
she
could
say
them
by
heart
the
field
with
the
big
gap
the

she
thought
of
her
years
of
the
verses
she
had
sent
to
the
magazines
and
how
they
had
come
back
again
of
the
four
farms
on
the
hill
of
the
four
tales
not
written
the
wet

swept
cold
round
her

mamma
sat
waiting
in
her
chair
in
the
in
the
clear
grey
glassy
dusk
of
the
she
waited
for
the
fine
weather
to
come
when
she
would
work
again
in
the
garden
she
waited
for
you
to
come
to
her
her
forehead
unknitted
itself
her
dove
eyes
brightened
she
smiled
and
the
rough
feathers
of
her
eyebrows
lay
down
appeased
at
the
opening
of
the
door
she
stirred
in
her
chair
she
was
glad
when
you
came
catty
brought
in
the
lamp
when
she
turned
up
the
wick
the
rising
flame
carved
mamma
face
out
of
the
dusk
her
pretty
face
delicately
dinted
whitened
with
a
powdery
down
stained
with
faint
bistres
of
age
her
little
nose
stood
up
from
the
softness
clear
and
young
firm
as
ivory
the
globed
light
showed
like
a
ball
of
fire
hung
out
in
the
garden
on
the
black
glassy
darkness
behind
the
pane
catty
drew
down
the
blind
and
went
you
heard
the
click
of
the
latch
falling
to
behind
her
the
evening
had
begun
they
took
up
their
books
mamma
hid
her
face
behind
anthony
trollope
mary
hers
behind
thomas
hardy
presently
she
would
hear
mamma
sigh
then
yawn
horrible
tension
under
the
edge
of
her
book
she
would
see
anthony
trollope
lying
in
mamma
lap
and
mamma
fingers
playing
with
the
fringe
of
her
shawl
she
would
put
thomas
hardy
down
and
take
up
anthony
trollope
and
read
aloud
till
mamma
head
began
bowing
in
a
doze
then
she
would
take
up
thomas
hardy
when
mamma
waked
hardy
would
go
down
under
trollope
when
she
dozed
he
would
come
to
the
top
again
after
supper
mamma
would
be
wide
awake
she
would
sit
straight
up
in
her
chair
waiting
motionless
ready
you
would
pick
up
your
book
but
you
would
have
no
heart
in
it
you
knew
what
she
wanted
she
knew
that
you
knew
you
could
go
on
trying
to
read
if
you
chose
but
she
would
still
sit
there
waiting
you
would
know
what
she
was
thinking
of
the
green
box
in
the
cabinet
drawer
the
green
box
you
began
to
think
of
it
too
hidden
hidden
in
the
cabinet
drawer
you
were
disturbed
by
the
thought
of
the
green
box
of
the
little
figures
inside
it
white
and
green
you
would
get
up
and
go
to
the
cabinet
drawer
mamma
would
put
out
her
hands
on
the
table
ready
she
smiled
with
shut
lips
pouting
half
ashamed
half
delighted
you
would
set
out
the
green
and
white
chequer
board
the
rows
of
pawns
and
the
game
of
halma
would
begin
white
figures
over
green
green
over
white
your
hand
and
your
eyes
playing
your
brain
hanging
inert
remembering
forgetting
in
the
pauses
of
the
game
you
waited
for
the
clock
to
strike
ten
for
catty
to
bring
in
the
bible
and
the
for
the
evening
to
end
old
verses
old
unfinished
verses
coming
and
going
in
the
long
pauses
of
the
game
when
mamma
sat
hypnotised
by
the
green
and
white
chequers
her
curved
hand
lifted
holding
her
pawn
her
head
quivering
with
indecision
dreams
he
has
made
you
wise
with
the
wisdom
of
silence
and
prayer
coming
and
going
between
the
of
the
green
figures
and
the
white
who
has
blinded
your
eyes
with
the
dusk
of
your
hair
brown
hair
sleek
and
thin
brown
hair
that
would
go
grey
and
the
evening
would
go
on
soundless
and
calm
with
soft
annihilating
feet
with
the
soft
cruel
feet
of
oblivion
iii
one
day
when
she
came
in
she
heard
the
sound
of
the
piano
the
knocking
of
loose
hammers
on
dead
wires
the
light
hacking
clang
of
chords
rolling
like
dead
drum
taps
droom
droom
alone
in
the
dusk
mamma
was
playing
the
hungarian
march
bowing
and
swaying
as
she
played
when
the
door
opened
she
started
up
turning
her
back
on
the
piano
frightened
like
a
child
caught
in
a
play
it
is
ashamed
of
the
piano
looked
mournful
and
then
suddenly
all
by
itself
it
shot
out
a
cry
like
an
arrow
a
pinging
stinging
violently
vibrating
cry
i
afraid
mamma
said
something
happened
to
the
piano
iv
they
were
turning
out
the
cabinet
drawer
when
they
found
the
bundle
of
letters
mamma
had
marked
it
in
her
sharp
three
cornered
correspondence
mary
dear
me
she
said
i
did
know
i
kept
those
letters
she
slipped
them
from
the
rubber
band
and
looked
at
them
you
could
see
uncle
victor
on
the
top
then
maurice
jourdain
you
heard
the
click
of
her
tongue
that
dismissed
those
useless
unimportant
things
the
slim
yellowish
letter
at
the
bottom
was
miss
lambert
oh
let
me
see
that
she
looked
over
her
mother
shoulder
they
read
together
we
do
want
her
to
go
she
made
us
love
her
more
in
one
fortnight
than
girls
we
had
with
us
for
years
perhaps
some
day
we
may
have
her
again
the
poor
kind
woman
the
kind
dead
woman
years
ago
dead
her
poor
voice
rising
up
a
ghostlike
wail
over
your
unbelief
that
was
only
the
way
she
began
i
say
i
say
the
thin
voice
was
quivering
with
praise
incredible
bewildering
praise
remarkable
you
would
have
thought
there
had
never
been
such
a
remarkable
child
as
mary
olivier
it
came
back
to
her
she
could
see
miss
lambert
talking
to
her
father
on
the
platform
at
victoria
she
could
see
herself
excited
running
up
the
flagged
walk
at
five
elms
and
mamma
coming
down
the
hall
and
what
happened
then
the
shock
and
all
the
misery
that
came
after
that
was
the
letter
you
would
let
me
read
what
do
you
mean
the
day
i
came
back
i
asked
you
to
let
me
read
it
and
you
would
really
mary
you
accuse
me
of
the
most
awful
things
i
do
believe
i
would
let
you
read
it
you
did
i
remember
you
did
want
me
to
know
well
her
mother
said
giving
in
suddenly
if
i
did
it
was
because
i
thought
it
would
make
you
even
more
conceited
than
you
were
i
suppose
i
was
very
well
pleased
with
you
at
the
time
still
you
kept
it
but
her
mother
was
not
even
going
to
admit
that
she
had
kept
it
she
said
i
must
have
overlooked
it
but
we
can
burn
it
now
she
carried
it
across
the
room
to
the
fire
she
did
want
even
now
even
now
you
saw
again
the
old
way
of
it
her
little
obstinate
triumphant
smile
the
look
that
paid
you
out
that
said
see
how
sold
you
the
violet
ashen
sheet
clung
to
the
furred
soot
of
the
chimney
you
could
still
see
the
blenched
letters
she
could
really
have
thought
it
would
make
you
conceited
that
was
only
what
she
wanted
to
think
she
had
thought
it
was
easy
to
make
you
pleased
with
me
all
the
time
still
i
ca
think
why
on
earth
you
were
pleased
she
knelt
before
the
fire
watching
the
violet
ashen
bit
of
paper
the
cause
the
stupid
cause
of
it
all
her
mother
had
settled
again
placidly
in
her
chair
even
if
i
a
bit
conceited
i
do
think
i
was
really
i
only
wanted
to
know
whether
i
could
do
things
i
wanted
people
to
tell
me
just
because
i
did
know
but
even
if
i
was
what
did
it
matter
you
must
have
known
i
loved
you
desperately
all
the
time
i
did
know
it
mary
then
you
were
stup
oh
say
i
was
stupid
it
what
you
think
it
what
you
always
have
thought
you
were
you
were
if
you
did
see
it
see
what
how
i
cared
i
can
remember
when
i
was
a
kid
the
awful
feeling
it
used
to
make
me
i
did
know
that
if
you
did
care
you
a
queer
way
of
showing
it
that
was
because
i
thought
you
did
who
told
you
i
did
care
for
you
i
did
need
to
be
told
i
could
see
the
difference
her
mother
sat
fixed
in
a
curious
stillness
she
held
her
elbows
pressed
tight
against
her
sides
her
face
was
hard
and
still
her
eyes
looked
away
across
the
room
you
were
different
she
said
you
were
like
any
of
the
others
i
was
afraid
of
you
you
used
to
look
at
me
with
your
little
bright
eyes
i
felt
as
if
you
knew
everything
i
was
thinking
i
never
knew
what
say
or
do
next
no
her
face
was
hard
there
was
something
else
something
clear
clear
and
beautiful
i
suppose
i
i
did
like
your
being
clever
it
was
the
boys
i
wanted
to
do
things
not
you
do
mamma
darling
the
stiff
tight
body
let
go
its
hold
of
itself
the
eyes
turned
to
her
again
i
was
jealous
of
you
mary
and
i
was
afraid
for
my
life
you
find
it
out
eighteen
eighteen
nineteen
hundred
three
years
her
mind
kept
on
stretching
it
held
three
years
in
one
span
like
one
year
the
large
rhythm
of
time
appeased
and
exalted
her
in
the
long
summers
while
mamma
worked
in
the
garden
she
translated
the
you
could
do
it
after
you
had
read
whitman
if
you
gave
up
the
superstition
of
singing
the
little
tunes
of
rhyme
if
you
left
off
that
eternal
jingling
and
listened
you
could
hear
what
it
ought
to
be
something
between
talking
and
singing
if
you
wrote
verse
that
could
be
chanted
that
could
be
whispered
shouted
screamed
as
they
moved
agave
and
her
maenads
verse
that
would
go
with
a
throbbing
beat
excited
exciting
beyond
rhyme
that
would
be
nearest
to
the
greek
verse
september
nineteen
hundred
across
the
room
she
could
see
the
pale
magazine
on
the
table
where
five
minutes
ago
mamma
had
laid
it
down
she
could
see
the
black
letters
of
its
title
and
the
squat
column
of
the
table
of
contents
the
magazine
with
her
poem
in
it
and
mamma
sitting
very
straight
very
still
you
would
never
know
what
she
was
thinking
she
had
said
anything
you
could
tell
whether
she
was
glad
or
sorry
or
whether
she
was
afraid
the
air
tingled
with
the
thought
of
the
magazine
with
your
poem
in
it
but
you
would
never
know
what
she
was
thinking
vi
a
long
letter
from
uncle
edward
uncle
edward
was
worrying
mamma
he
never
could
get
on
with
your
poor
father
or
your
uncle
victor
he
did
his
best
to
prevent
him
being
made
trustee
and
now
he
comes
meddling
wanting
to
upset
all
their
arrangements
why
just
because
poor
victor
business
is
doing
quite
so
well
as
it
did
yes
but
why
he
bothering
about
it
well
he
says
i
ought
to
make
another
will
leaving
half
the
boys
money
to
you
that
would
be
taking
it
from
dan
he
always
had
a
grudge
against
poor
dan
but
you
must
do
anything
of
the
sort
well
he
knows
your
father
provided
for
you
you
to
have
the
five
elms
money
that
in
your
uncle
victor
business
you
suppose
to
hear
him
talk
that
it
was
safe
there
just
tell
him
to
mind
his
own
business
mary
said
actually
mamma
went
on
advising
me
not
to
pay
back
any
more
of
victor
money
i
shall
tell
him
i
sent
the
last
of
it
yesterday
there
would
be
no
more
debts
to
uncle
victor
mark
had
paid
back
his
mamma
had
paid
back
roddy
scraping
and
scraping
mark
and
mamma
over
ten
years
over
twenty
a
long
letter
from
uncle
victor
uncle
victor
was
worrying
mamma
do
imagine
that
i
shall
take
this
money
i
have
invested
it
for
you
in
sound
securities
not
in
my
own
business
that
i
am
afraid
i
ought
to
tell
you
is
no
longer
a
sound
security
poor
victor
it
almost
looks
mamma
said
as
if
edward
might
be
right
so
right
that
in
his
next
letter
uncle
victor
prepared
you
for
his
bankruptcy
it
will
not
affect
you
and
mary
he
wrote
i
may
as
well
tell
you
now
that
all
the
five
elms
money
has
been
reinvested
and
is
safe
as
for
myself
i
can
assure
you
that
after
the
appalling
anxiety
of
the
last
ten
years
the
thought
of
bankruptcy
is
a
relief
a
blessed
relief
caroline
all
through
september
and
october
the
long
letters
came
from
uncle
victor
then
aunt
lavvy
short
letter
that
told
you
of
his
death
then
the
lawyer
letters
it
seemed
that
after
all
uncle
victor
had
been
mistaken
his
affairs
were
in
perfect
order
only
the
five
elms
money
was
gone
and
the
money
mark
and
mamma
had
paid
back
to
him
he
had
taken
it
all
out
of
his
own
business
and
put
it
into
the
sheba
mines
and
joe
reef
and
the
golconda
company
where
he
thought
it
would
be
safe
the
poor
dear
the
poor
dear
vii
so
that
you
knew
mamma
might
believe
what
aunt
lavvy
told
her
that
he
had
only
gone
to
look
out
of
the
window
and
had
turned
giddy
aunt
lavvy
might
believe
that
he
did
know
what
he
was
doing
but
you
knew
he
had
been
afraid
afraid
he
would
go
up
to
the
after
they
took
aunt
charlotte
away
because
he
was
afraid
then
at
last
after
all
those
years
he
had
gone
up
when
he
knew
he
was
caught
in
the
net
and
could
get
out
he
had
found
that
they
had
moved
the
linen
cupboard
from
the
window
back
into
the
night
nursery
and
he
had
bolted
the
staircase
door
on
himself
he
had
shut
himself
up
and
the
great
bare
high
window
was
there
and
the
low
sill
and
the
steep
bare
wall
dropping
to
the
lane
below
end
of
book
four
book
five
middle
age
xxxi
i
she
must
have
been
sitting
there
twenty
minutes
she
was
afraid
to
look
up
at
the
clock
afraid
to
move
an
eyelid
lest
she
should
disturb
him
the
library
had
the
same
nice
leathery
tobaccoey
smell
rough
under
her
fingers
the
same
little
sharp
tongue
of
leather
scratched
up
from
the
arm
of
her
chair
the
hanging
fans
of
the
would
be
making
the
same
japanese
pattern
in
the
top
left
hand
pane
of
the
third
window
she
wanted
to
see
it
again
to
make
sure
of
the
pattern
but
she
was
afraid
to
look
up
if
she
looked
up
she
would
see
him
she
must
it
would
disturb
him
horribly
he
could
write
if
he
thought
you
were
looking
at
him
it
was
wonderful
that
he
could
go
on
like
that
with
somebody
in
the
room
that
he
let
you
sit
in
it
when
he
was
writing
the
big
man
she
had
asked
him
whether
she
had
better
go
away
and
come
back
again
and
he
had
said
no
he
did
want
her
to
go
away
he
would
keep
her
waiting
more
than
five
minutes
it
was
unbelievable
that
she
should
be
sitting
there
in
that
room
as
if
nothing
had
happened
as
if
were
there
as
if
they
might
come
in
any
minute
as
if
they
had
never
gone
a
week
ago
she
would
have
said
it
was
impossible
she
could
do
it
for
anybody
no
matter
how
big
or
how
celebrated
he
was
why
after
ten
years
it
must
be
ten
years
she
could
even
bear
to
go
past
the
house
while
other
people
were
in
it
she
hated
them
the
people
who
took
greffington
hall
for
the
summer
holidays
and
the
autumn
shooting
she
would
go
round
to
renton
by
jackson
yard
and
the
fields
so
as
not
to
see
it
but
when
the
brutes
were
gone
and
the
yellow
blinds
were
down
in
the
long
rows
of
windows
that
you
saw
above
the
grey
garden
wall
she
liked
to
pass
it
and
look
up
and
pretend
that
the
house
was
only
waiting
for
them
only
sleeping
its
usual
winter
sleep
resting
till
they
came
back
it
ten
years
since
they
had
gone
no
if
richard
nicholson
had
been
sutcliffe
nephew
she
could
no
matter
how
big
and
how
celebrated
he
was
or
how
badly
he
wanted
her
help
or
she
wanted
his
money
no
matter
how
wonderful
and
important
it
would
feel
to
be
richard
nicholson
secretary
it
was
really
his
money
that
she
wanted
it
would
be
worth
while
doing
it
for
nothing
for
the
sake
of
knowing
him
she
had
read
his
she
wondered
supposing
he
kept
her
how
long
would
it
last
he
was
in
the
middle
of
his
first
series
of
in
greek
and
there
would
be
two
or
even
three
if
he
went
on
he
had
taken
greffington
hall
for
four
months
when
he
went
back
to
london
he
would
have
to
have
somebody
else
perhaps
he
would
tell
her
that
after
thinking
it
over
he
had
found
he
did
want
her
then
would
be
the
end
of
it
if
she
looked
up
she
would
see
him
she
knew
what
she
would
see
the
fine
cross
upper
lip
lifted
backwards
by
the
moustache
the
small
grizzled
brown
moustache
turned
up
that
made
it
look
crosser
the
narrow
pensive
lower
lip
thrust
out
by
its
light
jaw
his
nose
quite
a
young
nose
that
would
be
roman
be
sutcliffe
it
looked
out
over
your
head
tilted
itself
up
to
sniff
the
world
obstinate
alert
his
eyes
young
too
bright
and
dark
sheltered
safe
from
age
under
the
low
straight
eyebrows
they
would
never
have
shabby
wrinkled
sagging
lids
dark
brown
hair
grey
above
his
ears
clipped
close
to
stop
its
curling
like
his
uncle
he
liked
to
go
clipped
and
clean
you
felt
that
he
liked
his
own
tall
straight
slenderness
the
big
library
rustled
with
the
quick
irritable
sound
of
his
writing
it
stopped
he
had
finished
he
looked
at
the
clock
she
heard
a
small
commiserating
sound
forgive
me
i
really
thought
it
would
only
take
five
minutes
how
on
earth
do
you
manage
to
keep
so
quiet
i
should
have
known
if
a
mouse
had
moved
he
turned
towards
her
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
you
do
mind
my
smoking
he
was
settling
himself
now
she
would
know
well
he
said
if
i
did
keep
you
waiting
forty
minutes
it
was
a
good
test
was
it
he
meditated
i
always
changing
my
secretaries
because
of
something
the
last
one
was
admirable
but
i
could
have
stood
her
in
the
room
when
i
was
writing
besides
you
work
better
can
you
tell
in
a
week
yes
i
can
tell
are
you
sure
you
can
spare
me
four
months
easily
five
six
if
you
were
still
here
i
sha
be
i
shall
be
in
london
could
you
come
up
i
could
possibly
his
cross
mouth
and
brilliant
irritated
eyes
questioned
her
i
could
leave
my
mother
ii
five
weeks
of
the
four
months
gone
and
he
was
going
up
to
london
only
till
friday
only
for
five
days
she
kept
on
telling
herself
he
would
stay
longer
once
he
was
there
you
could
tell
how
many
days
he
might
stay
but
say
he
did
come
back
till
the
middle
of
july
still
there
would
be
the
rest
of
july
and
all
august
and
september
he
was
walking
home
with
her
carrying
the
books
she
liked
walking
with
him
she
liked
to
be
seen
walking
with
him
as
she
used
to
like
being
seen
walking
with
roddy
and
mark
because
she
was
proud
of
them
proud
of
belonging
to
them
she
was
proud
of
richard
nicholson
because
of
what
he
had
done
the
morfe
people
did
know
anything
about
what
he
had
done
but
they
knew
he
was
something
wonderful
and
important
they
knew
it
was
wonderful
and
important
that
you
should
be
his
secretary
they
were
proud
of
you
glad
that
they
had
provided
him
with
you
proud
that
he
should
have
found
what
he
was
looking
for
in
morfe
belk
for
instance
coming
along
the
road
he
used
to
pass
you
with
a
jaunty
gallant
curious
look
as
if
you
were
seventeen
and
he
were
saying
there
a
girl
who
ought
to
be
married
why
is
she
he
had
just
sidled
past
them
abashed
and
obsequious
a
little
afraid
of
the
big
man
even
belk
was
obsequious
and
spencer
rollitt
he
was
proud
because
richard
nicholson
had
asked
him
about
a
secretary
and
he
had
recommended
you
funny
that
people
could
go
on
disapproving
of
you
for
twenty
years
and
then
suddenly
approve
because
of
richard
nicholson
and
mamma
mamma
thought
you
wonderful
and
important
too
mamma
liked
nicholson
ever
since
that
sunday
when
he
had
called
and
brought
the
roses
and
stayed
to
tea
she
had
gone
out
of
the
room
and
left
them
abruptly
because
she
was
afraid
of
his
cleverness
afraid
that
he
would
begin
to
talk
about
something
that
she
did
understand
and
he
had
said
how
beautiful
she
is
after
he
had
gone
she
had
told
mamma
that
richard
nicholson
had
said
she
was
beautiful
and
mamma
had
pretended
that
it
did
matter
what
he
said
but
she
had
smiled
all
the
same
he
carried
himself
like
sutcliffe
when
he
walked
straight
and
tall
in
his
clean
cut
grey
suit
only
he
was
lighter
and
leaner
his
eyes
looked
gentle
and
peaceable
now
under
the
shadow
of
the
panama
hat
the
front
door
stood
open
she
asked
him
to
come
in
for
tea
may
i
what
are
you
doing
afterwards
going
for
a
walk
somewhere
will
you
let
me
come
too
he
was
standing
by
the
window
looking
at
the
garden
she
saw
him
smile
when
he
heard
catty
say
that
mamma
had
gone
over
to
waugh
and
would
be
back
for
tea
he
smiled
to
himself
a
secret
happy
smile
looking
out
into
the
garden
she
took
him
out
through
the
orchard
he
went
stooping
under
the
low
apple
boughs
and
laughing
down
the
back
lane
and
through
the
gap
in
the
lower
fields
along
the
flagged
path
to
the
bottom
lane
and
through
the
rathdale
fields
to
the
river
over
the
stepping
stones
she
took
the
stones
at
a
striding
run
he
followed
running
and
laughing
up
the
rathdale
fields
to
renton
moor
not
up
the
schoolhouse
lane
or
on
the
garthdale
road
or
along
the
fields
by
the
beck
not
up
greffington
edge
or
karva
because
of
lindley
vickers
and
maurice
jourdain
and
roddy
and
mark
no
she
was
humbugging
herself
not
up
karva
because
of
her
secret
happiness
she
did
want
to
mix
him
up
with
or
with
the
self
that
had
felt
it
she
wanted
to
keep
him
in
the
clear
spaces
of
her
mind
away
from
her
memories
away
from
her
emotions
they
sat
down
on
the
side
of
the
moor
in
the
heather
indoors
when
he
was
working
he
was
irritable
and
restless
you
would
hear
a
gentle
sighing
sound
and
he
would
start
up
and
walk
about
the
room
there
would
be
shakings
of
his
head
twistings
of
his
eyebrows
shruggings
of
his
shoulders
and
tormented
gestures
of
his
hands
but
not
out
here
he
sat
in
the
heather
as
quiet
as
motionless
as
you
were
every
muscle
at
rest
his
mind
was
at
rest
the
strong
sunlight
beat
on
him
it
showed
up
small
surface
signs
perhaps
you
could
see
now
that
he
might
really
be
forty
or
even
no
you
could
you
could
see
or
feel
anything
but
the
burning
inextinguishable
youth
inside
him
the
little
grey
streaks
and
patches
might
have
been
powder
put
on
for
fun
i
want
to
finish
with
all
my
greek
stuff
he
said
suddenly
i
want
to
go
on
to
something
else
studies
in
modern
french
literature
then
english
i
want
to
get
everything
clean
and
straight
in
five
pages
where
other
people
would
take
fifty
i
want
to
go
smash
through
some
of
the
traditions
the
tradition
of
the
long
grey
paragraph
we
might
learn
things
from
france
but
we
a
proud
island
people
we
wo
learn
we
a
proud
island
people
held
in
too
tight
held
in
till
we
burst
that
why
we
no
aesthetic
restraint
no
restraint
of
any
sort
take
our
economics
take
our
politics
we
had
to
colonise
to
burst
out
over
continents
when
our
minds
begin
moving
it
the
same
thing
they
burst
out
all
over
the
place
when
we
learned
restraint
we
shall
take
our
place
inside
europe
not
outside
it
we
do
restrain
our
emotions
quite
a
lot
we
do
we
do
that
precisely
why
we
do
restrain
our
expression
of
them
really
unrestrained
emotion
that
forces
its
way
through
and
breaks
down
your
intellectual
defences
and
saturates
you
with
itself
it
any
words
it
has
any
words
or
very
few
the
mown
fields
over
there
below
greffington
edge
were
bleached
with
the
sun
the
grey
cliffs
quivered
in
the
hot
yellow
light
it
might
be
somewhere
in
the
south
of
france
agaye
no
not
agaye
the
limestone
country
i
ca
think
why
i
never
came
here
my
uncle
used
to
ask
me
dozens
of
times
i
suppose
i
funked
it
what
the
poor
old
chap
must
have
felt
like
shut
up
in
that
house
all
those
years
with
my
aunt
please
do
i
i
liked
her
you
mean
you
liked
him
and
put
up
with
her
because
of
him
we
all
did
that
she
was
kind
to
me
who
would
be
oh
but
you
do
know
how
kind
kind
good
lord
yes
there
are
millions
of
kind
people
in
the
world
it
possible
to
be
kind
and
at
the
same
time
not
entirely
brainless
he
would
mind
that
he
would
think
she
was
brainless
he
was
in
love
with
her
there
was
another
woman
a
girl
it
was
so
like
the
dear
old
duffer
to
put
it
off
till
he
was
and
then
come
a
cropper
over
a
little
girl
of
seventeen
that
is
true
i
knew
him
much
better
than
you
do
he
never
cared
for
anybody
but
her
besides
if
it
was
true
you
should
have
told
me
i
no
business
to
know
it
everybody
knew
it
the
poor
dear
managed
so
badly
that
everybody
in
the
place
knew
it
she
knew
that
why
she
dragged
him
away
and
made
him
live
abroad
she
hated
living
abroad
but
she
liked
it
better
than
seeing
him
going
to
pieces
over
the
girl
i
do
believe
it
if
there
was
anything
in
it
i
have
been
sure
to
have
heard
of
it
why
there
was
anybody
here
but
me
it
must
have
been
years
before
your
time
he
said
you
could
hardly
even
have
come
in
for
the
sad
end
of
it
dorsy
heron
said
it
was
true
it
was
you
he
was
in
love
with
everybody
saw
it
but
you
she
remembered
his
face
when
she
came
to
him
in
the
library
and
what
he
had
said
a
man
might
be
in
love
with
you
for
ten
years
and
you
would
know
about
it
if
he
held
his
tongue
and
face
her
poor
face
so
worried
when
people
saw
them
together
and
that
last
night
when
she
stroked
your
arm
and
when
she
saw
him
looking
at
it
and
stopped
and
her
eyes
frightened
frightened
how
i
must
have
hurt
him
how
i
must
have
hurt
them
both
nicholson
had
come
back
on
friday
as
he
had
said
iii
he
put
down
his
scratching
pen
and
was
leaning
back
in
his
chair
looking
at
her
she
wondered
what
he
was
thinking
sometimes
the
space
of
the
room
was
enormous
between
her
table
by
the
first
tall
window
and
his
by
the
third
sometimes
it
shrank
and
brought
them
close
it
was
bringing
them
close
now
you
ca
see
the
text
for
the
footnotes
she
said
the
notes
must
go
in
the
appendix
she
wanted
to
make
herself
forget
that
all
her
own
things
the
things
she
had
saved
from
the
last
burning
were
lying
there
on
his
table
staring
at
her
she
was
trying
not
to
look
that
way
not
to
let
herself
imagine
for
a
moment
that
he
had
read
them
never
mind
the
notes
and
the
appendix
he
had
got
up
he
was
leaning
now
against
the
tall
shutter
of
her
window
looking
down
at
her
why
did
you
tell
me
before
i
let
you
in
for
that
horrible
drudgery
all
that
typing
and
indexing
if
i
only
known
you
were
doing
anything
like
this
why
could
you
have
told
me
because
i
was
doing
it
it
was
done
ages
ago
it
my
fault
i
ought
to
have
known
i
did
know
there
was
something
i
ought
to
have
attended
to
it
and
found
out
what
it
was
he
began
walking
up
and
down
the
room
turning
on
her
again
and
again
making
himself
more
and
more
excited
that
translation
of
the
what
made
you
think
of
doing
it
like
that
i
been
reading
walt
whitman
it
showed
me
you
could
do
without
rhyme
i
knew
it
must
sound
as
if
it
was
all
spoken
chanted
that
they
sing
then
i
thought
perhaps
that
was
the
way
to
do
it
yes
yes
it
is
the
way
to
do
it
the
only
way
you
see
that
what
my
euripides
book
about
the
very
thing
i
been
trying
to
ram
down
people
throats
for
years
and
all
the
time
you
were
doing
it
down
here
all
by
yourself
for
fun
i
wish
i
known
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
i
did
think
anything
could
be
done
he
sat
down
to
consider
that
part
of
it
he
was
going
to
get
it
published
for
her
he
was
going
to
write
the
introduction
and
the
other
things
oh
well
that
another
matter
there
not
much
of
it
that
stand
he
knew
he
would
never
say
more
or
less
than
he
meant
not
much
of
it
that
would
stand
now
that
she
knew
it
was
extraordinary
how
little
she
minded
still
there
are
a
few
things
they
must
come
out
first
in
the
spring
then
the
in
the
autumn
i
want
it
to
be
clear
from
the
start
that
you
a
poet
translating
not
the
other
way
on
he
walked
home
with
her
discussing
gravely
how
it
would
be
done
iv
it
had
come
without
surprise
almost
without
excitement
the
quiet
happening
of
something
secretly
foreseen
present
to
her
mind
as
long
as
she
could
remember
i
always
meant
that
this
should
happen
something
like
this
now
that
it
had
happened
she
was
afraid
seeing
but
not
so
clearly
what
would
come
afterwards
something
that
would
make
her
want
to
leave
morfe
and
mamma
and
go
away
to
london
and
know
the
people
richard
nicholson
had
told
her
about
the
people
who
would
care
for
what
she
had
done
the
people
who
were
doing
the
things
she
cared
about
to
talk
to
them
to
hear
them
talk
she
was
afraid
of
wanting
that
more
than
anything
in
the
world
she
saw
her
fear
first
in
mamma
eyes
when
she
told
her
and
there
was
something
else
something
to
do
with
richard
nicholson
something
she
did
want
to
think
about
not
fear
exactly
but
a
sort
of
uneasiness
when
she
thought
about
him
his
mind
really
was
the
enormous
perfect
crystal
she
had
imagined
it
had
been
brought
close
to
her
she
had
turned
it
in
her
hand
and
seen
it
flash
and
shine
she
had
looked
into
it
and
seen
beautiful
clear
things
in
it
nothing
that
was
beautiful
and
clear
she
was
afraid
of
wanting
to
look
at
it
again
when
it
was
there
because
it
had
made
her
happy
she
might
come
to
want
it
more
than
anything
in
the
world
in
two
weeks
it
would
be
gone
she
would
want
it
and
it
would
not
be
there
when
she
passed
the
house
and
saw
the
long
rows
of
yellow
blinds
in
the
grey
front
she
thought
of
him
he
would
not
come
back
he
had
never
come
before
so
it
was
likely
he
would
come
again
his
being
there
was
one
of
the
things
that
only
happened
once
perhaps
those
were
the
perfect
things
the
things
that
would
never
pass
away
they
would
stay
for
ever
beautiful
as
you
had
seen
them
fixed
in
their
moment
of
perfection
wearing
the
very
air
and
light
of
it
for
ever
you
would
see
them
specie
under
the
form
of
eternity
so
that
richard
nicholson
would
always
be
like
that
the
same
whenever
you
thought
of
him
look
at
the
others
the
ones
that
had
come
back
and
the
ones
that
had
jimmy
ponsonby
harry
craven
sutcliffe
and
maurice
jourdain
and
lindley
vickers
if
maurice
jourdain
had
never
come
back
she
would
always
have
seen
him
standing
in
the
cornfield
if
lindley
vickers
had
never
come
back
she
would
have
seen
him
with
nannie
learoyd
in
the
schoolhouse
lane
the
moment
when
he
held
her
hands
in
the
standing
by
the
piano
would
have
been
their
one
eternal
moment
because
jimmy
ponsonby
had
gone
away
she
had
never
known
the
awful
thing
he
had
done
she
would
go
through
the
ilford
fields
for
ever
and
ever
with
her
hot
hand
in
his
she
happy
and
he
innocent
innocent
for
ever
and
ever
harry
craven
her
playmate
of
two
hours
he
would
always
be
playing
always
laughing
always
holding
her
hand
like
roddy
without
knowing
that
he
held
it
suppose
sutcliffe
had
come
back
she
would
have
hurt
them
more
and
more
sutcliffe
would
have
hated
her
they
would
have
been
miserable
all
three
all
three
damned
for
ever
and
ever
she
was
not
sure
she
wanted
richard
nicholson
to
come
back
she
was
not
sure
he
was
spoiling
it
by
writing
she
had
thought
he
would
do
that
a
correspondence
prolonging
the
beautiful
moment
stretching
it
thin
thinner
and
thinner
stretching
it
so
thin
that
it
would
snap
you
would
come
to
identify
him
with
his
letters
so
that
in
the
end
you
would
lose
what
had
been
real
what
had
been
perfect
you
would
forget
you
would
have
another
and
less
real
kind
of
memory
but
his
letters
were
not
thin
they
were
as
real
as
his
voice
they
his
voice
talking
to
you
you
could
tell
which
words
would
take
the
stress
of
it
i
do
know
how
there
is
of
you
whether
this
is
all
of
it
or
only
a
little
bit
you
gave
me
an
impression
you
made
me
feel
that
there
might
be
any
gone
under
that
you
ca
get
at
that
you
may
get
at
if
you
go
on
staying
where
you
are
i
believe
if
you
got
clean
away
it
might
come
to
the
top
again
but
i
do
i
do
know
whether
you
at
the
end
or
the
beginning
i
could
tell
better
if
you
were
here
she
counted
the
months
till
april
when
her
poems
would
come
out
she
counted
the
days
till
tuesday
when
there
might
be
a
letter
from
richard
nicholson
if
only
he
would
not
keep
on
telling
you
you
ought
to
come
to
london
that
was
what
made
you
afraid
he
might
have
seen
how
impossible
it
was
he
had
seen
mamma
do
try
to
dig
me
out
of
my
i
on
living
in
it
for
ever
if
i
never
taken
out
but
if
i
got
out
once
it
would
be
awful
coming
back
it
is
awful
now
do
make
it
awful
he
only
wrote
i
make
it
awfuller
and
until
out
you
come
xxxii
i
things
were
happening
in
the
village
the
old
people
were
dying
james
had
died
in
a
fit
the
day
after
christmas
day
old
heron
had
died
of
a
stroke
in
the
first
week
of
january
she
had
left
dorsy
her
house
and
furniture
and
seventy
pounds
a
year
belk
got
the
rest
the
people
were
growing
old
louisa
wright
hair
hung
in
a
limp
white
fold
over
each
ear
her
face
had
tight
lines
in
it
that
pulled
it
into
grimaces
her
eyes
had
milky
white
rings
like
speedwell
when
it
begins
to
fade
dorsy
heron
otter
brown
hair
was
striped
with
grey
her
nose
stood
up
sharp
and
bleak
in
her
red
withering
face
her
sharp
tender
mouth
drooped
at
the
corners
she
was
it
was
cruel
cruel
cruel
it
hurt
you
to
see
them
rather
than
own
it
was
cruel
they
went
about
pulling
faces
and
pretending
they
were
happy
their
gestures
had
become
exaggerated
tricks
that
they
would
never
grow
out
of
that
gave
them
the
illusion
of
their
youth
the
old
people
were
dying
and
the
people
were
growing
old
nothing
would
ever
begin
for
them
again
each
morning
when
she
got
out
of
bed
she
had
the
sacred
solemn
certainty
that
for
her
everything
was
beginning
at
what
was
a
a
feeling
she
had
got
if
you
have
got
the
feeling
you
are
not
you
can
be
any
age
you
please
nineteen
but
she
had
been
horribly
old
at
nineteen
she
could
remember
what
it
had
felt
like
the
desperate
sadness
the
certainty
that
nothing
interesting
would
ever
happen
she
had
got
hold
of
life
at
the
wrong
end
and
all
the
time
her
youth
had
been
waiting
for
her
at
the
other
end
at
the
turn
of
the
unknown
road
at
all
through
the
autumn
and
winter
richard
nicholson
had
kept
on
writing
her
poems
would
be
out
on
the
tenth
of
april
on
the
third
the
note
came
shall
i
still
find
you
at
morfe

never
find
me

shall
bike

nice

four
we
could
have
tea
there
and
ride
out
ii
i
excited
i
never
been
to
tea
in
an
hotel
before
she
was
chattering
like
a
fool
saying
anything
that
came
into
her
head
to
break
up
the
silence
he
made
she
was
aware
of
something
underneath
it
something
that
was
growing
more
and
more
beautiful
every
minute
she
was
trying
to
smash
this
thing
lest
it
should
grow
more
beautiful
than
she
could
bear
you
see
how
i
score
by
being
shut
up
in
morfe
when
i
do
get
out
it
no
end
of
an
adventure
was
there
ever
such
an
idiot
suddenly
she
left
off
trying
to
smash
the
silence
the
silence
made
everything
stand
out
with
a
supernatural
clearness
the
square
table
in
the
bay
of
the
window
the
queen
anne
fluting
on
the
britannia
metal
teapot
the
cups
and
saucers
and
plates
white
with
a
gentian
blue
band
the
king
head
stamped
in
gold
like
a
crest
sitting
there
so
still
he
had
the
queer
effect
of
creating
for
both
of
you
a
space
of
your
own
more
real
than
the
space
you
had
just
stepped
out
of
there
there
and
not
anywhere
else
these
supernaturally
clear
things
had
reality
a
unique
but
impermanent
reality
it
would
last
as
long
as
you
sat
there
and
would
go
when
you
went
you
knew
that
whatever
else
you
might
forget
you
would
remember
this
the
rest
of
the
room
the
other
tables
and
the
people
sitting
at
them
were
not
quite
real
they
stood
in
another
space
a
different
and
inferior
kind
of
space
i
came
first
of
all
he
said
to
bring
you
he
took
out
of
his
pocket
and
put
down
between
them
the
thin
new
white
parchment
book
of
her
oh
poor
thing
i
wonder
what
happen
to
it
funny
it
was
the
least
real
thing
if
it
existed
at
all
it
existed
somewhere
else
not
in
this
space
not
in
this
time
if
you
took
it
up
and
looked
at
it
the
clearness
the
unique
impermanent
reality
would
be
gone
and
you
would
never
get
it
again
they
had
finished
the
run
down
reyburn
hill
their
pace
was
slackening
on
the
level
he
said
that
a
jolly
bicycle
of
yours
is
it
i
sure
you
like
to
know
i
bought
it
with
the
wonderful
cheque
you
gave
me
i
should
never
have
had
it
without
that
i
glad
you
got
something
out
of
that
awful
time
awful
it
was
one
of
the
nicest
times
i
ever
had
nearly
all
my
nice
times
have
been
in
that
house
i
know
he
said
my
uncle
would
let
you
do
anything
you
liked
if
you
were
young
enough
he
ought
to
have
had
children
of
his
own
they
have
kept
him
out
of
mischief
i
ca
think
she
said
to
the
surrounding
hills
why
people
get
into
mischief
or
why
they
go
and
kill
themselves
when
they
can
ride
bicycles
instead
iii
mamma
was
sitting
upright
and
averted
with
an
air
of
effacement
holding
the
thin
white
book
before
her
like
a
fan
every
now
and
then
you
could
see
her
face
swinging
round
from
behind
the
cover
and
her
eyes
looking
at
richard
nicholson
above
the
rims
of
her
glasses
uneasy
frightened
eyes
iv
the
big
pink
roses
of
the
chintzes
and
the
gold
bordered
bowls
of
the
black
mirrors
looked
at
you
rememberingly
there
was
a
sort
of
brutality
about
it
to
come
here
and
be
happy
to
come
here
in
order
to
be
happy
when
were
gone
when
you
had
hurt
them
both
so
horribly
i
sitting
in
her
chair
she
thought
richard
nicholson
sat
in
a
purely
temporary
attitude
by
the
table
in
the
window
against
the
she
could
see
his
side
face
drawn
in
a
brilliant
furred
line
of
light
his
moustache
twitched
under
the
shadow
of
his
nose
he
was
smiling
to
himself
as
he
wrote
the
letter
to
mamma
there
was
a
brutality
about
that
too
she
wondered
if
he
had
seen
old
baxter
pinched
mouth
and
sliding
eyes
when
he
took
the
letter
he
was
watching
him
as
he
went
out
waiting
for
the
click
of
the
latch
it
all
right
he
said
they
expect
you
they
think
it
work
he
settled
himself
in
sutcliffe
chair
it
the
best
way
he
said
i
want
to
see
you
and
i
do
want
to
frighten
your
mother
she
afraid
of
me
no
she
afraid
of
the
whole
thing
she
wishes
it
had
happened
she
afraid
of
what
happen
next
i
ca
make
her
see
that
nothing
need
happen
next
she
cleverer
than
you
think
she
sees
that
something
got
to
happen
next
i
could
stand
another
evening
like
the
last
you
could
she
agreed
you
could
possibly
we
ca
exactly
go
on
like
like
this
you
know
do
let
think
about
it
here
we
are
now
this
minute
it
an
hour
and
a
half
till
dinner
time
why
even
if
i
go
at
nine
we
got
three
hours
that
not
enough
you
talk
as
though
we
could
think
or
not
think
as
we
chose
even
if
we
left
off
thinking
we
should
have
to
go
on
living
your
mother
knows
that
i
do
think
she
knows
more
than
we
do
she
knows
enough
to
frighten
her
she
knows
what
want
i
want
to
marry
you
mary
this
then
was
what
she
had
been
afraid
of
but
mamma
would
have
thought
of
it
i
did
think
you
wanted
to
do
that
why
should
you
it
the
usual
thing
is
it
when
you
care
enough
you
care
enough
more
than
enough
do
you
it
no
use
saying
you
do
i
know
you
do

i
go
about
showing
it

suddenly
and
when
i
gave
you
your
book

looked
as
though
you
wished
i
had
as
though
dragged
you
away
from
somewhere
where
you
were
happy

it
only
began
yesterday

can
stop
it

found
out
that
there
was
peace
when
you
came
into
the
room
and
no
peace
when
you
went
out
when
you
there
peace
oozes
out
of
you
and
soaks
into
me
all
the
time
does
it
feel
like
that
just
like
that
but
if
it
feels
like
that
now
we

spoil
it
by
marrying

mamma
you
do
want
to
marry
if
you
wanted
to
you
have

waiting
till
you
think
of
two
people
tied
up
together
for
life
whether
they
both
like
it
or
not
it
is
even
as
if
one
of
them
could
be
happy
how
could
you
if

sutcliffes

how
he
hated

and

a
kind
patient
man

the
only
possible

one
impossible
way

courage

the
sea

your
coffin

my
coffin

her
mother
said
mamma
was
getting
up
from
her
chair
raising
herself
slowly
by
her
arms
mary
stooped
to
pick
up
the
do
mamma
i
got
it
mamma
went
on
stooping
sinking
sliding
down
sideways
clutching
at
the
edge
of
the
table
mary
saw
terror
bright
animal
terror
darting
up
to
her
out
of
eyes
and
in
a
place
by
themselves
the
cloth
sliding
the
lamp
rocking
and
righting
itself
she
was
dragging
her
up
by
her
armpits
holding
her
up
mamma
arms
were
dangling
like
dolls
arms
and
like
a
machine
wound
up
like
a
child
in
a
passion
she
still
struggled
to
walk
her
knees
thrust
out
doubled
up
giving
way
her
feet
trailing
vi
not
a
stroke
well
only
a
slight
stroke
a
threatening
a
warning
remember
she
getting
old
mary
any
little
worry
or
excitement
would
do
it
she
was
worried
and
excited
about
me
richard
worried
and
excited
her
if
i
could
only
stay
awake
till
she
sleeps
she
lying
there
like
a
lamb
calling
me
dear
and
afraid
of
giving
me
trouble
her
little
hands
dragged
the
bedclothes
up
to
her
chin
when
charles
came
she
looked
at
him
with
her
bright
terrified
eyes
she
is
old
she
ca
be
when
her
eyes
are
so
bright
she
thinks
it
a
stroke
she
wo
believe
him
she
thinks
she
die
like
heron
perhaps
she
knows
perhaps
charles
really
thinks
she
die
and
wo
tell
me
richard
thought
it
he
was
sorry
and
gentle
because
he
knew
you
could
see
by
his
cleared
smoothed
face
and
that
dreadfully
kind
dreadfully
wise
look
he
gave
into
everything
with
an
air
of
insincere
provisional
acquiescence
as
if
he
knew
it
could
be
for
very
long
charles
must
have
told
him
richard
wants
it
to
happen
richard
wanting
it
ca
make
it
happen
it
might
though
richard
might
get
at
her
his
mind
and
will
might
be
getting
at
her
all
the
time
making
her
die
he
might
do
it
without
knowing
he
was
doing
it
because
he
could
help
it
he
might
do
it
in
his
sleep
but
i
can
stop
that
if
richard
mind
and
will
can
make
her
die
my
mind
and
will
can
keep
her
from
dying
there
was
something
i
did
before
that
time
i
wanted
to
go
away
with
the
sutcliffes
when
roddy
was
coming
home
something
happened
then
if
it
happened
then
it
can
happen
now
if
i
could
remember
how
you
do
it
flat
on
your
back
with
your
eyes
shut
not
tight
shut
you
must
feel
your
eyelids
you
must
feel
any
part
of
you
at
all
you
think
of
nothing
absolutely
nothing
not
even
think
you
keep
on
not
feeling
not
thinking
not
seeing
things
till
the
blackness
comes
in
waves
blacker
and
blacker
that
how
it
was
before
then
the
blackness
was
perfectly
still
you
could
feel
your
breathing
or
your
heart
beating
it
coming
all
right
blacker
and
blacker
it
was
like
this
before
is
an
awful
feeling
dying
must
be
like
this
one
thing
going
after
another
something
holding
down
your
heart
stopping
its
beat
something
holding
down
your
chest
crushing
the
breath
out
of
it
do
think
about
the
feeling
do
feel
think
of
the
blackness
it
is
the
same
blackness
there
are
specks
and
shreds
of
light
in
it
you
ca
get
the
light
away
do
think
about
the
blackness
and
the
light
let
everything
go
except
yourself
hold
on
to
yourself
but
you
felt
your
self
going
going
and
coming
back
gathered
together
incredibly
free
disentangled
from
the
net
of
nerves
and
veins
it
did
move
any
more
with
the
movement
of
the
net
it
was
clear
and
still
in
the
blackness
intensely
real
then
it
willed
your
self
willed
it
was
free
to
will
you
knew
that
it
had
never
been
free
before
except
once
it
had
never
willed
before
except
once
willing
was
this
waves
and
waves
of
will
coming
on
and
on
making
your
will
driving
it
through
empty
time
the
time
of
time
that
was
the
self
time
where
nothing
happens
except
this
where
nothing
happens
except
god
will
god
will
in
your
will
self
of
your
self
reality
of
reality
it
had
felt
like
that
mamma
had
waked
up
she
was
saying
she
was
better
mamma
was
better
she
said
she
felt
perfectly
well
she
could
walk
across
the
room
she
could
walk
without
your
holding
her
it
could
have
been
that
it
could
possibly
it
was
a
tiny
haemorrhage
and
it
had
dried
up
it
would
have
dried
up
just
the
same
if
you
had
done
anything
those
things
what
did
happen
was
extraordinary
enough
the
queer
dying
the
freedom
afterwards
the
intense
stillness
the
intense
energy
the
certainty
something
was
there
that
horrible
dream
dorsy
ought
to
have
made
me
go
and
see
the
old
woman
in
the
workhouse

richard
had
gone
up
into
his
own
flat
and
left
her
to
wash
and
dress
and
explore
he
had
told
her
she
was
to
have
tiedeman
flat
not
knowing
who
tiedeman
was
made
it
more
wonderful
that
god
should
have
put
it
into
his
head
to
go
away
for
easter
and
lend
you
his
flat
if
you
wanted
anything
you
could
ring
and
they
would
come
up
from
the
basement
and
look
after
you
she
did
want
them
to
come
up
yet
she
wanted
to
lie
back
among
her
cushions
where
richard
had
packed
her
and
turn
over
the
moments
and
remember
what
they
had
been
like
getting
out
of
the
train
at
cross
and
finding
richard
there
coming
with
him
out
of
the
thin
white
april
light
into
the
rich
darkness
and
brilliant
colours
of
the
room
the
feeling
of
richard
hands
as
they
undid
her
fur
stole
and
peeled
the
sleeves
of
her
coat
from
her
arms
seeing
him
kneel
on
the
hearthrug
and
make
tea
with
an
air
of
doing
something
intensely
interesting
an
air
of
security
and
possession
he
went
about
in
tiedeman
rooms
as
if
they
belonged
to
him
she
liked
tiedeman
flat
the
big
outer
room
curtained
with
thick
gentian
blue
and
thin
violet
there
was
a
bowl
of
crimson
and
purple
anemones
on
the
dark
oval
of
the
oak
table
tiedeman
books
covered
the
walls
with
their
coloured
bands
and
stripes
and
the
illuminated
gold
of
their
tooling
the
deep
bookcases
made
a
ledge
all
round
up
the
wall
and
the
shallow
bookcases
went
on
above
it
to
the
ceiling
but
those
white
books
on
the
table
were
richard
books
olivier
mary
olivier
books
that
i
gave
him
they
rooms
she
got
up
and
looked
about
that
long
dark
thing
was
her
coat
and
fur
stretched
out
on
the
flat
couch
in
the
corner
where
richard
had
laid
them
stretched
out
in
an
absolute
peace
and
rest
she
picked
them
up
and
went
into
the
inner
room
that
showed
through
the
wide
square
opening
the
small
brown
room
no
furniture
but
richard
writing
table
and
his
chair
a
tall
narrow
french
window
looking
to
the
backs
of
houses
and
opening
on
a
leaded
balcony
trees
green
balls
held
up
on
ramrod
stems
in
green
tubs
richard
garden
curtains
of
thin
silk
brilliant
magenta
letting
the
light
through
the
hanging
green
bough
of
a
plane
tree
high
up
on
the
pane
between
a
worn
magentaish
rug
on
the
dark
floor
she
went
through
the
door
on
the
right
and
found
a
short
narrow
passage
another
french
window
opening
from
it
on
to
the
balcony
a
bathroom
on
the
other
side
a
small
white
panelled
bedroom
at
the
end
she
had
no
new
gown
nothing
but
the
black
chiffon
one
black
because
of
uncle
victor
she
had
bought
two
years
ago
with
richard
cheque
she
had
worn
it
at
greffington
that
evening
when
she
dined
with
him
it
had
a
long
pointed
train
its
thin
open
wide
spreading
sleeves
fell
from
her
shoulders
in
long
pointed
wings
it
made
her
feel
slender
there
was
no
light
in
the
inner
room
clear
glassy
dark
twilight
behind
the
tall
window
she
stood
there
waiting
for
richard
to
come
down
richard
loved
all
this
he
loved
beautiful
books
beautiful
things
beautiful
anemone
colours
red
and
purple
with
the
light
coming
through
them
thin
silk
curtains
that
let
the
light
through
like
the
thin
silky
tissues
of
flowers
he
loved
the
sooty
brown
london
walls
houses
standing
back
to
back
the
dark
flanks
of
the
back
wings
jutting
out
almost
meeting
across
the
trenches
of
the
gardens
making
the
colours
in
his
rooms
brilliant
as
stained
glass
he
loved
the
sound
of
the
street
outside
intensifying
the
quiet
of
the
house
it
was
the
backs
that
were
so
beautiful
at
night
the
long
straight
ranges
of
the
dark
walls
the
sudden
high
dark
cliffs
and
peaks
of
the
walls
hollowed
out
into
long
galleries
filled
with
thick
burning
light
rows
on
rows
of
oblong
casements
opening
into
the
light
here
and
there
a
tree
stood
up
black
in
the
trenches
of
the
gardens
the
tight
strain
in
her
mind
loosened
and
melted
in
the
stream
of
the
pure
new
light
the
pure
new
darkness
the
pure
new
colours
richard
came
in
they
stood
together
a
long
time
looking
out
they
did
say
a
word
then
as
they
turned
back
to
the
lighted
outer
room
i
thought
i
was
to
have
had
tiedeman
flat
well
he
up
another
flight
of
stairs
and
the
rain
makes
a
row
on
the
skylight
it
was
simpler
to
take
his
and
give
you
mine
i
want
you
to
have
mine
ii
she
turned
off
the
electric
light
and
shut
her
eyes
and
lay
thinking
the
violent
motion
of
the
express
prolonged
itself
in
a
ghostly
vibration
rocking
the
bed
in
still
space
unshaken
by
this
tremor
she
could
see
the
other
rooms
the
quiet
beautiful
rooms
i
wonder
how
mamma
and
dorsy
are
getting
on
i
not
going
to
think
about
mamma
it
is
fair
to
richard
i
sha
think
about
anybody
but
richard
for
this
fortnight
one
evening
of
it
gone
already
it
might
have
lasted
quite
another
hour
if
he
had
got
up
and
gone
away
so
suddenly
what
a
fool
i
was
to
let
him
think
i
was
tired
there
will
be
thirteen
evenings
more
thirteen
you
can
stretch
time
out
by
doing
a
lot
of
things
in
it
doing
something
different
every
hour
when
you
with
richard
every
minute
different
from
the
last
and
he
brings
you
the
next
all
bright
and
new
heaven
would
be
like
that
imagine
an
eternity
of
heaven
being
with
richard
for
ever
and
ever
but
nobody
ever
did
imagine
an
eternity
of
heaven
people
only
talk
about
it
because
they
ca
imagine
it
what
they
mean
is
that
if
they
had
one
minute
of
it
they
would
remember
that
for
ever
and
ever
this
is
richard
life
this
is
what
i
have
taken
from
him
if
i
let
him
marry
me
i
dare
even
think
what
it
would
have
been
like
if
i
tried
to
mix
up
mamma
and
richard
in
the
same
house
and
poor
little
mamma
in
a
strange
place
with
nothing
about
it
that
she
could
remember
going
up
and
down
in
it
trying
to
get
at
me
and
looking
reproachful
and
disapproving
all
the
time
she
have
to
be
shut
in
her
own
rooms
because
richard
would
have
her
in
his
sitting
up
waiting
to
be
read
aloud
to
and
played
halma
with
when
richard
wanted
me
saying
the
same
things
over
and
over
again
sighing
richard
would
go
off
his
head
if
he
heard
mamma
sigh
he
wants
to
be
by
himself
the
whole
time
working
like
blazes
he
likes
to
feel
that
the
very
servants
are
battened
down
in
the
basement
so
that
he
does
know
they
there
he
could
stand
tiedeman
and
peters
if
they
were
doing
the
same
thing
tiedeman
working
like
blazes
in
the
flat
above
him
and
peters
working
like
blazes
in
the
flat
below
richard
slept
in
this
room
last
night
he
will
sleep
in
it
again
when
gone
she
switched
the
light
on
to
look
at
it
for
another
second
the
panelled
cabin
the
small
chest
of
drawers
the
small
wardrobe
shining
my
hat
in
that
wardrobe
lying
on
richard
waistcoat
fast
asleep
if
tiedeman
flat
up
there
that
richard
walking
up
and
down
over
my
head
if
it
rains
there
be
a
row
on
the
skylight
and
he
sleep
he
is
sleeping
now
iii
it
would
be
much
nicer
to
walk
home
through
kensington
gardens
and
hyde
park
she
was
glad
that
they
were
going
to
have
a
quiet
evening
after
three
evenings
at
the
play
and
richard
ruining
himself
in
hansoms
and
not
sleeping
after
this
unbelievable
afternoon
all
those
people
those
terribly
important
people
it
was
amusing
to
go
about
with
richard
and
feel
important
yourself
because
you
were
with
him
and
to
see
richard
ways
with
them
his
nice
way
of
behaving
as
if
was
important
in
the
least
as
if
it
was
you
they
had
made
all
that
fuss
about
to
think
that
the
little
dried
up
schoolmasterish
man
was
professor
lee
ramsden
prowling
about
outside
the
group
eager
and
shy
waiting
to
be
introduced
to
you
nobody
taking
the
smallest
notice
of
him
the
woman
who
had
brought
him
making
soft
sentimental
eyes
at
you
through
the
gaps
in
the
group
and
trying
to
push
him
in
a
bit
nearer
then
richard
asking
you
to
be
kind
for
one
minute
to
the
poor
old
thing
it
hurt
you
to
see
him
shy
and
humble
and
out
of
it
and
when
you
thought
of
his
arrogance
at
durlingham
it
was
the
women
voices
that
tired
you
so
and
their
nervous
snapping
eyes
the
best
of
all
was
going
away
from
them
quietly
with
richard
into
kensington
gardens
did
you
like
it
mary
frightfully
but
not
half
so
much
as
this
iv
she
was
all
alone
in
the
front
room
stretched
out
on
the
flat
couch
in
the
corner
facing
the
door
he
was
still
writing
his
letter
in
the
inner
room
when
she
heard
him
move
she
would
slide
her
feet
to
the
floor
and
sit
up
she
wanted
to
lie
still
with
her
hands
over
her
shut
eyes
making
the
four
long
delicious
days
begin
again
and
go
on
in
her
head
richard
take
hansoms
you
could
stop
him
perhaps
he
was
afraid
if
you
walked
too
far
you
would
drop
down
dead
when
it
was
all
over
your
soul
would
still
drive
about
london
in
a
hansom
for
ever
and
ever
through
blue
and
gold
days
through
poignant
white
evenings
through
the
streaming
steep
darkness
and
the
streaming
flat
thin
gold
of
the
wet
nights
they
were
not
going
to
have
any
more
tiring
parties
there
was
enough
time
when
she
opened
her
eyes
he
was
sitting
on
the
chair
by
the
foot
of
the
couch
leaning
forward
looking
at
her
she
saw
nothing
but
his
loose
hanging
hands
and
straining
eyes
oh
richard
what
time
is
it
she
swung
her
feet
to
the
floor
and
sat
up
suddenly
only
nine
only
nine
the
evening
nearly
gone
is
that
why
you
are
sleeping
richard
i
did
know
i
know
i
was
hurting
you
is
it
hurting
you
me
i
got
used
to
it
i
was
so
happy
just
being
with
you
so
happy
and
so
quiet
that
i
thought
you
did
care
well
what
was
i
to
think
if
you
wo
marry
me
that
because
i
care
so
frightfully
do
let
rake
that
up
again
well
there
it
is
she
thought
i
no
business
to
come
here
to
his
rooms
turning
him
out
making
him
so
wretched
that
he
ca
sleep
no
business
unless
and
we
got
to
go
on
living
with
it
he
said
he
thinks
i
have
the
courage
i
ca
him
yes
she
said
there
it
is
why
should
i
tell
him
we
only
ten
days
as
long
as
i
here
nothing
matters
but
richard
if
i
keep
perfectly
still
still
like
this
if
i
do
say
a
word
he
think
of
it
richard
would
you
rather
i
had
come
no
you
remember
the
evening
i
came
you
got
up
so
suddenly
and
left
me
what
did
you
do
that
for
because
if
i
stayed
another
minute
i
could
have
left
you
at
all
he
stood
up
and
you
only
going
now
because
you
ca
see
that
i
not
a
coward
this
would
last
the
leaping
and
knocking
of
her
heart
the
eyelids
screwing
themselves
tight
the
jerking
of
her
nerves
at
every
sound
at
the
two
harsh
rattling
screams
of
the
curtain
rings
along
the
pole
at
the
light
click
of
the
switches
only
the
small
lamp
still
burning
on
richard
writing
table
in
the
inner
room
she
could
hear
him
moving
about
softly
and
secretly
in
there
he
was
richard
that
was
richard
moving
about
in
there
richard
thought
his
flat
was
a
safe
place
but
it
was
people
creeping
up
the
stairs
every
minute
and
standing
still
to
listen
people
would
come
and
try
the
handle
of
the
door
they
wo
dear
nobody
ever
comes
in
it
has
never
happened
it
going
to
happen
now
yet
you
could
help
thinking
that
just
this
night
it
would
happen
she
thought
that
peters
knew
he
would
come
out
of
his
door
till
you
had
turned
the
corner
of
the
stairs
she
thought
the
woman
in
the
basement
knew
she
remembered
the
evening
at
greffington
baxter
pinched
mouth
and
his
eyes
sliding
sideways
to
look
at
you
she
knew
now
what
baxter
had
been
thinking
the
woman
look
was
the
female
of
baxter
as
if
that
could
hurt
you
vi
mary
do
you
know
you
growing
younger
every
minute
i
shall
go
on
growing
younger
and
younger
till
it
all
over
till
what
all
over
this
so
will
you
richard
not
in
the
same
way
my
hair
is
young
any
more
my
face
is
young
any
more
i
do
want
it
to
be
young
it
was
half
so
nice
a
face
when
it
was
young
some
other
woman
loved
it
when
it
was
young
yes
another
woman
loved
it
when
it
was
young
is
she
alive
and
going
about
oh
yes
she
alive
and
she
goes
about
a
lot
does
she
love
you
now
i
suppose
she
does
i
wish
she
did
you
need
mind
her
mary
she
was
never
anything
to
me
she
never
will
be
but
i
do
mind
her
i
mind
her
awfully
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
her
going
about
and
loving
you
she
no
business
to
why
do
i
mind
her
loving
you
more
than
i
mind
your
loving
her
because
you
like
loving
more
than
being
loved
how
do
you
know
i
know
every
time
i
hold
you
in
my
arms
there
have
been
other
women
then
or
he
would
know
the
difference
there
must
have
been
a
woman
that
he
loved
i
do
care
it
was
the
same
thing
what
are
you
thinking
i
thinking
nothing
was
ever
the
same
thing
as
this
no
whatever
we
do
mary
we
must
go
back
on
it
if
we
could
have
done
anything
else
but
i
ca
see
it
not
as
if
it
could
last
long
nothing
lasts
long
life
does
last
long
he
sounded
as
if
he
were
sorry
as
if
already
in
his
mind
he
had
gone
back
on
it
after
three
days
you
not
richard
only
when
i
think
of
you
the
awful
risks
i
made
you
take
ca
you
see
i
risks
i
always
have
liked
risks
when
we
were
children
my
brothers
and
i
were
always
trying
to
see
just
how
near
we
could
go
to
breaking
our
necks
i
know
you
courage
enough
for
anything
but
that
was
rather
a
different
sort
of
risk
no
no
there
are
no
different
sorts
of
risk
all
intense
moments
of
danger
are
the
same
it
always
the
same
feeling
i
do
know
whether
i
courage
or
not
but
i
do
know
that
when
danger
comes
you
do
care
you
hoisted
up
above
caring
you
care
mary
about
my
you
would
like
to
think
i
did
care
about
it
of
course
i
care
frightfully
if
i
did
where
the
risk
i
hate
your
having
to
take
it
all
i
do
risk
anything
i
wish
you
did
then
you
be
happier
poor
richard
so
safe
in
his
man
world

can
be
sorry
about
that
if
you
like
but
not
about
me
i
shall
never
be
sorry
nothing
in
this
world
can
make
me
sorry
i
should
like
mamma
to
know
about
it
but
even
mamma
could
make
me
sorry
i
always
been
happy
about
the
things
that
matter
the
real
things
i
hate
people
who
sneak
and
snivel
about
real
things
people
who
have
doubts
about
god
and
do
like
them
and
snivel
i
had
doubts
about
god
once
and
they
made
me
so
happy
i
could
hardly
bear
it
mamma
could
bear
it
making
me
happy
she
would
have
minded
half
so
much
if
i
had
been
sorry
and
snivelled
she
would
mind
so
much
if
i
was
sorry
and
snivelled
about
this
you
you
were
going
to
think
about
your
mother
i
not
thinking
about
her
i
thinking
about
how
happy
i
have
been
and
am
and
shall
be
even
thinking
about
mamma
could
hurt
you
now
nothing
could
hurt
the
happiness
you
shared
with
richard
what
it
was
now
it
would
always
be
pure
and
remorseless
vii
delicious
warm
shining
day
she
had
her
coat
and
hat
on
ready
to
go
down
with
him
the
hansom
stood
waiting
in
the
street
they
were
looking
up
the
place
on
the
map
when
the
loud
double
knock
came
that
for
peters
he
always
getting
wires
if
we
do
go
we
shall
never
go
we
only
got
five
more
now
the
long
soft
rapping
on
the
door
of
the
room
knuckles
rapping
out
their
warning
you
ca
say
i
do
give
you
time
richard
took
the
orange
envelope
it
for
you
mary
oh
richard
at
once
mother
she
would
catch
the
ten
train
that
was
what
the
hansom
was
there
for
i
send
your
things
on
after
you
the
driver
and
the
horse
knew
that
she
would
catch
the
train
richard
knew
he
had
the
same
look
on
his
face
that
was
there
before
when
mamma
was
sorrow
that
was
sorrow
and
the
same
clear
thought
behind
it
xxxiv
dorsey
nerves
were
in
a
shocking
state
you
could
see
she
had
been
afraid
all
the
time
from
the
first
day
when
mamma
had
kept
on
saying
has
mary
come
back
dorsy
was
sure
that
was
how
it
began
but
she
could
tell
you
whether
it
was
before
or
afterwards
that
she
had
forgotten
the
days
of
the
week
anybody
could
forget
the
days
of
the
week
what
frightened
dorsy
was
hearing
her
say
suddenly
mary
she
said
it
to
herself
when
she
did
know
dorsy
was
in
the
room
then
she
had
left
off
asking
and
wondering
for
five
days
she
had
said
anything
about
you
not
anything
at
all
when
she
heard
your
name
she
stared
at
them
with
a
queer
scared
look
catty
said
that
yesterday
she
had
begun
to
be
afraid
of
dorsy
and
could
bear
her
in
the
room
that
was
what
made
them
send
the
wire
what
had
she
been
thinking
of
those
five
days
it
was
as
though
she
knew
dorsy
said
she
did
believe
she
was
thinking
anything
at
all
dorsy
did
know
ii
somebody
knew
somebody
had
been
talking
she
had
found
catty
in
the
room
making
up
the
bed
for
her
in
the
corner
catty
was
crying
as
she
tucked
in
the
blankets
there
some
people
she
said
as
had
ought
to
be
poisoned
but
she
would
say
why
she
was
crying
you
could
tell
by
belk
face
his
mouth
drawn
in
between
claws
of
nose
and
chin
by
belk
face
and
her
busy
eyes
staring
by
the
old
men
sitting
on
the
bench
at
the
corner
their
eyes
coming
together
as
you
passed
and
spencer
rollitt
stretching
himself
straight
and
looking
away
over
your
head
and
drawing
in
his
breath
with
a
when
he
asked
how
mamma
was
his
thoughts
were
hidden
behind
his
bare
wooden
face
he
was
a
just
and
cautious
man
he
would
accept
any
statement
outside
the
bible
without
proof
you
had
to
go
down
and
talk
to
waugh
she
had
come
to
see
how
you
would
look
her
mouth
talked
about
mamma
but
her
face
was
saying
all
the
time
i
not
going
to
ask
you
what
you
were
doing
in
london
in
nicholson
flat
mary
i
sure
you
would
do
anything
you
be
sorry
to
think
of
with
your
poor
mother
in
the
state
she
in
i
do
care
i
do
care
what
they
think
there
would
still
be
catty
and
dorsy
and
louisa
wright
and
miss
kendal
and
charles
with
their
kind
eyes
that
loved
you
and
richard
living
his
eternal
life
in
your
heart
and
mamma
would
never
know
iii
mamma
was
going
backwards
and
forwards
between
the
open
and
the
cabinet
she
was
taking
out
the
ivory
reels
and
thimbles
and
button
boxes
wrapping
them
in
tissue
paper
and
hiding
them
in
the
cabinet
when
she
had
locked
the
doors
she
waited
till
you
were
looking
to
lift
up
her
skirt
and
hide
the
key
in
her
petticoat
pocket
she
was
happy
like
a
busy
child
at
play
she
was
never
ill
only
tired
like
a
child
that
plays
too
long
her
face
was
growing
smooth
and
young
and
pretty
again
a
pink
flush
under
her
eyes
she
would
never
look
disapproving
or
reproachful
any
more
she
could
listen
any
more
when
you
read
aloud
to
her
she
had
forgotten
how
to
play
halma
one
day
she
found
the
green
box
in
the
cabinet
drawer
she
came
to
you
carrying
it
with
care
when
she
had
put
it
down
on
the
table
she
lifted
the
lid
and
looked
at
the
little
green
and
white
pawns
and
smiled
roddy
soldiers
she
said
richard
does
know
what
he
talking
about
when
he
asks
me
to
give
up
mamma
he
might
as
well
ask
me
to
give
up
my
child
it
no
use
his
saying
she
is
there
any
minute
she
may
come
back
and
remember
and
know
me
she
must
have
known
me
yesterday
when
she
asked
me
to
go
and
see
what
papa
was
doing
as
for
waiting
he
may
have
to
wait
years
and
years
and
i
now
iv
the
round
black
eye
of
the
mirror
looked
at
them
their
figures
would
be
there
hers
and
richard
at
the
bottom
of
the
black
crystal
bowl
small
like
the
figures
in
the
wrong
end
of
a
telescope
very
clear
in
the
deep
clear
swirl
of
the
glass
they
were
sitting
close
together
on
the
old
couch
couch
you
could
see
him
putting
the
cushions
at
her
back
tucking
the
wide
victorian
skirt
in
close
about
the
feet
in
the
black
velvet
slippers
and
she
would
lie
there
with
her
poor
hands
folded
in
the
white
cashmere
shawl
richard
knew
what
you
were
thinking
you
ca
expect
me
he
was
saying
to
behave
like
my
uncle
besides
it
a
little
too
late
is
it
we
said
whatever
we
did
we
would
go
back
on
it
if
it
was
wrong
then
mary
it
is
wrong
now
it
is
that
richard
no
not
that
pure
and
remorseless
then
pure
and
remorseless
now
she
wondered
whether
he
had
heard
it
the
crunching
on
the
gravel
walk
under
the
windows
stopping
suddenly
when
the
feet
stepped
on
to
the
grass
and
the
hushed
growl
of
the
men
voices
baxter
and
the
gardener
they
had
come
to
see
whether
the
light
would
go
out
again
behind
the
yellow
blinds
as
it
had
gone
out
last
night
if
you
were
a
coward
if
you
had
wanted
to
get
off
it
was
too
late
richard
knows
i
not
a
coward
funk
would
keep
me
from
him
it
what
is
it
then
ca
you
see
ca
you
feel
that
it
no
use
coming
again
just
for
this
it
never
be
what
it
was
then
it
always
be
like
last
night
and
you
think
i
do
care
something
holding
me
back
from
you
something
that
happened
to
me
i
do
know
yet
what
it
is
nerves
nothing
but
nerves
no
i
thought
it
was
nerves
last
night
i
thought
it
was
this
room
those
two
poor
ghosts
looking
at
us
i
even
thought
it
might
be
mark
and
roddy
all
of
them
tugging
at
me
to
get
me
away
from
you
but
it
is
that
it
something
in
me
you
trying
to
tell
me
you
do
want
me
i
trying
to
tell
you
what
happened
i
did
want
you
all
last
year
it
was
so
awful
that
i
had
to
stop
it
you
could
go
on
living
like
that
i
willed
and
willed
not
to
want
you
so
did
i
all
the
willing
in
the
world
could
stop
me
it
is
that
sort
of
willing
you
might
go
on
all
your
life
like
that
and
nothing
would
happen
you
have
to
find
it
out
for
yourself
and
even
that
might
take
you
all
your
life
it
is
the
thing
people
call
willing
at
all
it
much
queerer
awfully
queer
how
oh
the
sort
of
queerness
you
do
like
talking
about
i
sorry
mary
you
seem
to
be
talking
about
something
but
i
the
faintest
notion
what
it
is
but
you
can
make
yourself
believe
anything
you
like
if
you
keep
on
long
enough
no
half
the
time
i
doing
it
i
do
believe
it
come
off
but
it
always
does
every
time
it
the
same
every
time
exactly
as
if
something
had
happened
poor
mary
but
richard
it
makes
you
absolutely
happy
that
the
queer
part
of
it
it
how
you
know
know
he
was
angry
that
there
something
there
that
it
absolutely
real
real
why
not
if
it
makes
you
happy
without
the
thing
you
care
most
for
in
the
whole
world
there
must
be
something
there
it
must
be
real
real
in
a
way
that
nothing
else
is
you
are
happy
now
he
said
no
and
you
with
me
and
i
care
for
you
more
than
anything
in
the
whole
world
i
thought
you
said
that
was
all
over
no
it
only
just
begun
i
ca
say
i
see
it
you
see
it
all
right
soon
when
you
gone
it
was
no
use
not
marrying
him
no
use
sending
him
away
as
long
as
he
was
tied
to
you
by
his
want
you
had
no
business
to
be
happy
it
was
fair
there
was
he
tied
to
you
tighter
than
if
you
married
him
and
there
you
were
in
your
inconceivable
freedom
supposing
you
could
give
him
the
same
freedom
the
same
happiness
supposing
you
could
work
it
for
him
make
it
whatever
it
was
reach
out
and
draw
him
into
your
immunity
your
peace
vi
whatever
it
was
it
was
there
you
could
doubt
away
yourself
and
richard
but
you
could
doubt
away
it
it
might
leave
you
for
a
time
but
it
came
back
it
came
back
its
going
only
intensified
the
wonder
of
its
return
you
might
lose
all
sense
of
it
between
its
moments
but
the
thing
was
certain
while
it
lasted
doubt
it
away
and
still
what
had
been
done
for
you
lasted
done
for
you
once
for
all
two
years
ago
and
that
was
the
first
time
even
supposing
you
could
doubt
away
the
other
you
might
have
made
the
other
things
happen
by
yourself
but
not
that
not
giving
richard
up
and
still
being
happy
that
was
something
you
could
possibly
have
done
yourself
or
you
might
have
done
it
in
time
time
might
have
done
it
for
you
but
not
like
that
all
at
once
making
that
incredible
supernatural
happiness
and
peace
out
of
nothing
at
all
in
one
night
and
going
on
in
it
without
richard
richard
himself
did
believe
it
was
possible
he
simply
thought
it
had
happened
still
even
then
you
might
have
said
it
did
count
so
long
as
it
was
nothing
but
your
private
adventure
but
not
now
never
again
now
when
it
had
happened
to
richard
his
letter
did
tell
you
whether
he
thought
there
was
anything
in
it
he
saw
the
queerness
of
it
and
left
it
there
something
happened
that
night
after
you
gone
you
know
how
i
felt
i
could
stop
wanting
you
my
mind
was
tied
to
you
and
could
get
away
well
that
night
something
let
go
quite
suddenly
something
went
it
a
year
ago
and
it
has
come
back
i
did
know
what
on
earth
you
meant
by
wanting
and
still
caring
but
i
think
i
see
now
i
do
you
any
more
and
i
more
than
ever
do
like
blazes
still
i
glad
you
like
it
i
can
get
you
any
amount
of
the
same
thing
more
than
you
care
to
do
vii
he
did
know
how
hard
it
was
to
work
like
blazes
you
had
to
keep
your
eyes
ready
all
the
time
to
see
what
mamma
was
doing
you
had
to
take
her
up
and
down
stairs
holding
her
lest
she
should
turn
dizzy
and
fall
if
you
left
her
a
minute
she
would
get
out
of
the
room
out
of
the
house
and
on
to
the
green
by
herself
and
be
frightened
mamma
could
remember
the
garden
she
looked
at
her
flowers
with
dislike
you
had
brought
her
on
a
visit
to
a
strange
disagreeable
place
and
left
her
there
she
was
angry
with
you
because
she
could
get
away
then
suddenly
for
whole
hours
she
would
be
good
a
child
playing
its
delicious
game
of
goodness
when
charles
came
in
and
you
took
him
out
of
the
room
to
talk
about
her
you
would
tell
her
to
sit
still
until
you
came
back
and
she
would
smile
the
sweet
serious
smile
of
a
child
that
is
being
trusted
and
sit
down
on
the
parrot
chair
and
when
you
came
back
you
would
find
her
sitting
there
still
smiling
to
herself
because
she
was
so
good
why
do
i
love
her
now
when
she
is
like
this
when
is
what
i
was
afraid
of
what
i
thought
i
could
not
bear
why
do
i
love
her
more
if
anything
now
than
i
ever
done
before
why
am
i
happier
now
than
ever
been
before
except
in
the
times
when
i
was
writing
and
the
times
when
i
was
with
richard
viii
yesterday
she
was
and
she
would
be
she
had
come
through
the
dreadful
dangerous
year
without
thinking
of
it
and
nothing
had
happened
nothing
at
all
she
imagine
why
she
had
ever
been
afraid
of
it
she
could
hardly
remember
what
being
afraid
of
it
had
felt
like
aunt
charlotte
uncle
victor
if
i
were
going
to
be
mad
i
should
have
gone
mad
long
ago
when
roddy
came
back
when
mark
died
when
i
sent
richard
away
i
should
be
mad
now
it
was
getting
worse
in
the
cramped
room
where
the
big
bed
stuck
out
from
the
wall
to
within
a
yard
of
the
window
mamma
went
about
small
and
weak
in
her
wadded
lavender
japanese
like
a
child
that
ca
sit
still
looking
for
something
it
wants
that
nobody
can
find
you
could
think
because
of
the
soft
of
the
dreaming
sleepwalking
feet
in
the
slippers
when
you
were
looking
she
would
slip
out
of
the
room
on
to
the
landing
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
stand
there
vexed
and
bewildered
when
you
caught
her
ix
mamma
was
not
well
enough
now
to
get
up
and
be
dressed
they
had
moved
her
into
papa
room
it
was
bright
all
morning
with
the
sun
she
was
happy
there
she
remembered
the
yellow
furniture
she
was
back
in
the
old
bedroom
at
five
elms
mamma
lay
in
the
big
bed
waiting
for
you
to
brush
her
hair
she
was
playing
with
her
white
flannel
dressing
jacket
spread
out
before
her
on
the
counterpane
ready
she
talked
to
herself
lindley
vickers
vickers
lindley
but
she
was
not
thinking
of
lindley
vickers
she
was
thinking
of
dan
trying
to
get
back
to
dan
is
jenny
there
tell
her
to
go
and
see
what
master
roddy
doing
she
thought
catty

dan

in
sometimes
it
would
be
papa
but
not
often
she
soon
left
him
for
dan
and
roddy
always
dan
and
roddy
and
never
mark
never
mark
and
never
mary
had
she
forgotten
mark
or
did
she
remember
him
too
well
or
was
she
afraid
to
remember
supposing
there
was
a
black
hole
in
her
mind
where
mark
death
was
and
another
black
hole
where
mary
had
been
had
she
always
held
you
together
in
her
mind
so
that
you
went
down
together
did
she
hold
you
together
now
in
some
time
and
place
safer
than
memory
she
was
still
playing
with
the
she
smoothed
it
and
patted
it
and
folded
it
up
and
laid
it
beside
her
on
the
bed
she
took
up
her
and
shook
it
out
and
folded
it
and
put
it
on
the
top
of
the
what
are
you
doing
you
darling
going
to
bed
she
looked
at
you
with
a
smile
because
you
had
found
her
out
she
was
putting
out
the
baby
clothes
ready
serious
and
pleased
and
frightened
who
will
take
care
of
my
little
children
when
i
laid
aside
she
knew
what
she
was
lying
in
the
big
bed
for
x
it
was
really
bedtime
she
was
sitting
up
in
the
armchair
while
catty
who
was
jenny
made
her
bed
the
long
white
sheet
lay
smooth
and
flat
on
the
high
mattress
it
hung
down
on
the
floor
mamma
was
afraid
of
the
white
sheet
she
would
go
back
to
bed
there
a
coffin
on
the
bed
somebody
died
of
cholera
she
said
cholera
that
was
what
she
thought
mark
had
died
of
she
knows
who
i
am
now
xi
richard
had
written
to
say
he
was
married
on
the
of
february
that
was
just
ten
days
after
mamma
died
we
known
each
other
the
best
part
of
our
lives
so
you
see
it
a
very
sober
affair
he
had
married
the
woman
who
loved
him
when
he
was
young
a
very
sober
affair
not
what
it
would
have
been
if
you
and
he
he
did
want
you
to
think
that
would
ever
happen
again
he
wanted
you
to
see
that
with
him
and
you
it
had
been
different
that
you
had
loved
him
and
lived
with
him
in
that
other
time
he
had
made
for
you
where
you
were
always
young
he
had
only
made
it
for
you
she
poor
thing
would
have
to
put
up
with
other
people
time
time
that
made
them
made
them
old
you
had
got
to
write
and
tell
him
you
were
glad
you
had
got
to
tell
him
mamma
died
ten
days
ago
and
he
would
say
to
himself
if
i
waited
another
ten
days
there
was
nothing
he
could
say
to
you
that
was
why
he
did
write
again
there
was
nothing
to
say
xxxv
i
she
would
never
get
used
to
the
house
she
could
think
why
she
had
been
such
a
fool
as
to
take
it
on
a
seven
years
lease
too
it
would
feel
like
being
in
prison
for
seven
years
that
was
the
worst
of
moving
about
for
a
whole
year
in
boats
and
trains
and
staying
at
hotels
it
gave
you
an
unnatural
longing
to
settle
down
in
a
place
of
your
own
your
own
undying
lust
of
possession
if
you
to
have
things
why
a
house
why
six
rooms
when
two
would
have
done
as
well
and
left
you
your
freedom
after
all
that
ecstasy
of
space
that
succession
of
heavenly
places
with
singing
names
carcassone
and
vezelay
rome
and
florence
and
san
gimignano
marseilles
and
arles
and
avignon
filling
up
time
stretching
it
out
making
a
long
life
out
of
one
year
if
you
could
go
moving
on
and
on
while
time
stood
still
oh
this
damned
house
it
would
be
you
sitting
still
while
time
tore
by
as
it
used
to
tear
by
at
morfe
before
richard
came
and
in
the
three
years
after
he
had
gone
when
mamma
ii
it
was
rather
attractive
when
you
turned
the
corner
and
came
on
it
suddenly
and
small
clean
white
and
innocent
the
spring
twilight
gave
it
that
look
of
being
somewhere
in
italy
the
look
that
made
you
fall
in
love
with
it
at
first
sight
as
for
not
getting
used
to
it
that
was
precisely
the
effect
she
wanted
rooms
that
would
look
like
anything
in
the
house
at
morfe
things
that
she
would
always
come
on
with
a
faint
exquisite
surprise
the
worn
magentaish
rug
on
the
dark
polished
floor
the
oak
table
the
gentian
blue
chair
the
thin
magenta
curtains
letting
the
light
through
the
things
richard
had
given
her
because
in
their
beginning
they
had
been
meant
for
her
richard
knew
that
you
were
safe
from
unhappiness
that
you
had
never
once
gone
back
on
it
if
you
could
be
happy
with
his
things
he
had
thought
too
that
if
you
had
a
house
you
would
settle
down
and
work
you
would
have
to
you
would
have
to
work
like
blazes
after
spending
all
the
money
aunt
charlotte
left
you
on
rushing
about
and
half
the
money
aunt
lavvy
left
you
on
settling
down
it
was
horrible
this
living
on
other
people
deaths
iii
catty
could
bear
it
being
so
different
you
could
see
she
thought
you
were
unfaithful
not
to
have
kept
the
piano
when
mamma
had
played
on
it
catty
faithfulness
was
unsurpassable
she
had
wanted
to
marry
blenkiron
the
stonemason
at
morfe
but
first
she
would
because
of
mamma
and
then
she
would
because
of
miss
mary
when
you
told
her
to
go
back
and
marry
him
at
once
she
would
only
laugh
and
say
there
your
husband
and
there
your
children
you
my
child
miss
mary
master
roddy
was
jenny
child
and
you
was
always
mine
you
were
only
ten
years
younger
than
catty
but
like
richard
she
see
that
you
were
old
you
would
never
know
whether
catty
knew
about
richard
or
whether
dorsy
knew
whatever
you
did
they
would
love
you
catty
because
you
were
her
child
and
dorsy
because
you
were
mark
sister
iv
the
sun
had
been
shining
for
a
fortnight
she
could
sit
out
all
day
now
in
the
garden
it
was
nonsense
to
talk
about
time
standing
still
if
you
kept
on
moving
just
now
in
the
garden
when
the
light
came
through
the
thin
green
silk
leaves
of
the
lime
tree
for
a
moment
while
she
sat
looking
at
the
lime
tree
time
stood
still
catty
had
taken
away
the
and
was
going
down
the
four
steps
into
the
house
it
happened
between
the
opening
and
shutting
of
the
door
she
saw
that
the
beauty
of
the
tree
was
its
real
life
and
that
its
real
life
was
in
her
real
self
and
that
her
real
self
was
god
the
leaves
and
the
light
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
she
had
seen
it
before
when
the
tree
was
a
stem
and
bare
branches
on
a
grey
sky
and
that
beauty
too
was
the
real
life
of
the
tree
if
she
could
only
dream
about
mark
but
if
she
dreamed
about
any
of
them
it
was
always
mamma
she
had
left
her
in
the
house
by
herself
and
she
had
got
out
of
her
room
to
the
or
they
were
in
london
at
the
crossing
by
the
bank
and
mamma
was
frightened
she
had
to
get
her
through
the
thick
of
the
traffic
the
horses
pushed
at
mamma
and
you
tried
to
hold
back
their
noses
but
she
sank
down
and
slid
away
from
you
sideways
under
the
wheel
or
she
would
come
into
this
room
and
find
her
in
it
at
first
she
would
be
glad
to
see
that
mamma
was
still
there
then
she
would
be
unhappy
and
afraid
she
would
go
on
to
a
clear
thought
if
mamma
was
still
there
then
she
had
got
back
somehow
to
morfe
the
old
life
was
still
going
on
it
had
never
really
stopped
but
if
that
was
real
then
this
was
not
real
her
secure
shining
life
of
last
year
and
now
was
real
nothing
could
make
it
real
her
exquisite
sense
of
it
was
not
real
she
had
only
thought
it
had
happened
nothing
had
happened
but
what
had
happened
before
it
was
happening
now
it
would
go
on
and
on
till
it
frightened
you
till
you
could
not
bear
it
when
she
woke
up
she
was
glad
that
the
dream
had
been
nothing
but
a
dream
but
that
meant
that
you
were
glad
mamma
was
not
there
the
dream
showed
you
what
you
were
hiding
from
yourself
supposing
the
dead
knew
supposing
mamma
knew
and
mark
knew
that
you
were
glad
vi
it
came
to
her
at
queer
times
in
queer
ways
after
that
horrible
evening
at
the
dining
club
when
the
secretary
woman
put
her
as
far
as
possible
from
richard
next
to
the
little
jew
financier
who
smelt
of
wine
she
could
even
hear
what
richard
was
saying
the
little
jew
went
on
talking
about
women
suffrage
and
his
collection
of
fragonards
and
his
wife
portrait
by
sargent
his
tongue
slid
between
one
overhanging
and
one
dropping
jaw
in
and
out
like
a
shuttle
she
tried
not
to
hate
him
not
to
shrink
back
from
his
puffing
breath
to
be
kind
to
him
and
listen
and
smile
and
remember
that
his
real
secret
self
was
god
and
was
holy
not
to
attend
to
richard
voice
breaking
the
beat
of
her
heart
she
had
gone
away
before
richard
could
get
up
and
come
to
her
she
wanted
to
be
back
in
her
house
by
herself
she
had
pushed
open
the
french
windows
of
the
study
to
breathe
the
air
of
the
garden
and
see
the
tall
sycamore
growing
deep
into
the
thick
blue
night
half
the
room
reflected
on
the
long
pane
was
thrown
out
into
the
garden
she
saw
it
thinning
away
going
off
from
the
garden
into
another
space
existing
there
with
an
unearthly
reality
of
its
own
she
had
sat
down
at
last
too
tired
to
go
upstairs
and
had
found
herself
crying
incredibly
crying
all
the
misery
all
the
fear
all
the
boredom
of
her
life
gathered
together
and
discharging
now
if
i
could
get
out
of
it
all
her
crying
stopped
with
a
start
as
if
somebody
had
come
in
and
put
a
hand
on
her
shoulder
everything
went
still
she
had
a
sense
of
happiness
and
peace
suddenly
there
with
her
in
the
room
not
so
much
her
own
as
the
happiness
and
peace
of
an
immense
invisible
intangible
being
of
whose
life
she
was
thus
aware
she
knew
somehow
through
it
that
there
was
no
need
to
get
away
she
was
out
of
it
all
now
this
minute
there
was
always
a
point
where
she
could
get
out
of
it
and
into
this
enduring
happiness
and
peace
vii
they
were
talking
about
richard
and
his
wife
they
said
he
was
happy
he
was
in
love
with
her
he
never
had
been
she
knew
it
yet
she
took
him
and
tied
him
to
her
an
old
woman
older
than
richard
with
grey
hair
oh
well
she
had
had
to
wait
for
him
longer
than
he
waited
for
me
and
she
in
love
with
him
still
she
making
it
impossible
for
him
to
see
me
then
i
sha
see
him
i
do
want
him
to
see
me
if
it
hurts
her
i
do
want
her
to
be
hurt
i
wonder
if
she
knows
know
i
can
hear
them
talking
about
me
when
i
gone
mary
olivier
the
woman
who
translated
euripides
mary
olivier
the
woman
nicholson
discovered
mary
olivier
the
woman
who
was
nicholson
mistress
richard
mistress
i
know
that
what
they
say
but
i
ca
feel
that
they
saying
it
about
it
must
be
somebody
else
some
woman
i
never
heard
of
viii
sutcliffe
is
dead
he
died
two
weeks
ago
at
agaye
i
can
see
now
how
beautiful
they
were
how
beautiful
he
was
going
away
like
that
letting
her
take
him
away
so
that
the
sight
of
me
hurt
her
i
can
see
that
what
i
thought
so
ugly
was
really
beautiful
their
sticking
to
each
other
through
it
all
his
faithfulness
and
her
forgiveness
their
long
life
of
faithfulness
and
forgiveness
but
my
short
life
with
richard
was
beautiful
too
my
coming
to
him
and
leaving
him
free
i
shall
never
go
back
on
that
i
shall
never
be
sorry
for
it
the
things
i
sorry
for
are
not
caring
more
for
papa
being
unkind
to
mamma
not
doing
enough
for
her
not
knowing
what
she
was
really
like
i
give
anything
to
have
been
able
to
think
about
her
as
mark
thought
to
feel
about
her
as
he
felt
if
only
i
had
known
what
she
was
really
like
even
now
i
do
know
i
never
shall
but
going
to
richard
no
if
it
was
to
be
done
again
i
do
it
and
i
do
humbug
myself
about
it
if
i
made
richard
happy
i
made
myself
happy
too
made
me
happy
still
if
i
had
had
no
happiness
in
it
if
i
hated
it
i
have
done
it
for
richard
all
the
same
ix
all
this
religious
resignation
and
the
paradox
of
prayer
people
praying
one
minute
thy
will
be
done
then
praying
for
things
to
happen
or
not
happen
just
as
they
please
god
will
be
done
as
if
it
would
be
done
whatever
they
did
or
do
god
will
was
your
fate
the
thing
was
to
know
it
and
not
waste
your
strength
in
the
illusion
of
resistance
if
you
were
part
of
god
your
will
was
god
will
at
the
moment
when
you
really
willed
there
was
always
a
point
when
you
knew
it
the
flash
point
of
freedom
you
could
mistake
your
flash
when
it
came
you
doubt
away
that
certainty
of
freedom
any
more
than
you
could
doubt
away
the
certainty
of
necessity
and
determination
from
the
outside
they
were
part
of
the
show
of
existence
the
illusion
of
separation
from
god
from
the
inside
they
were
god
will
the
way
things
were
willed
was
the
reality
underneath
the
illusion
of
necessity
the
flash
point
of
freedom
was
your
consciousness
of
god
then
praying
would
be
willing
there
would
be
no
such
thing
as
passive
prayer
there
could
be
no
surrender
and
yet
there
was
not
the
surrender
of
your
will
but
of
all
the
things
that
entangle
and
confuse
it
that
stand
between
it
and
you
between
god
and
you
when
you
lay
still
with
your
eyes
shut
and
made
the
darkness
come
on
wave
after
wave
blotting
out
your
body
and
the
world
blotting
out
everything
but
your
self
and
your
will
that
was
a
dying
to
live
a
real
dying
a
real
life
the
christians
got
hold
of
real
things
and
turned
them
into
something
unreal
impossible
to
believe
the
grace
of
god
was
a
real
thing
it
was
that
miracle
of
perfect
happiness
with
all
its
queerness
its
divine
certainty
and
uncertainty
the
christians
knew
at
least
one
thing
about
it
they
could
see
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
deserving
but
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
believing
either
or
with
being
good
and
getting
into
heaven
it
heaven
it
had
to
do
with
beauty
absolutely
beauty
more
than
anything
else
she
could
see
the
way
of
it
beyond
that
it
had
come
to
her
when
she
was
a
child
in
brilliant
clear
flashes
it
had
come
again
and
again
in
her
adolescence
with
more
brilliant
and
clearer
flashes
then
after
leaving
her
for
years
it
had
come
like
this
streaming
in
and
out
of
her
till
its
ebb
and
flow
were
the
rhythm
of
her
life
why
had
she
known
that
this
would
happen
instead
of
being
afraid
that
she
would
go
like
aunt
charlotte
or
uncle
victor
people
talked
a
lot
about
compensation
but
nobody
told
you
that
after
life
would
have
this
exquisite
clearness
and
intensity
why
since
it
happen
when
you
were
young
reality
breaking
through
if
only
in
flashes
coming
and
going
going
altogether
and
forgotten
why
had
you
to
wait
so
long
before
you
could
remember
it
and
be
aware
of
it
as
one
continuous
shining
background
she
had
never
been
aware
of
it
before
she
had
only
thought
about
and
about
it
about
substance
the
reality
god
thinking
was
not
being
aware
she
made
it
out
more
and
more
for
years
something
had
come
between
her
and
reality
she
could
see
what
it
was
now
she
had
gone
through
life
wanting
things
wanting
people
clinging
to
the
thought
of
them
not
able
to
keep
off
them
and
let
them
go
x
all
her
life
she
had
gone
wrong
about
happiness
she
had
attached
it
to
certain
things
and
certain
people
mamma
and
mark
jenny
visits
to
aunt
bella
the
coming
of
aunt
charlotte
and
aunt
lavvy
and
uncle
victor
the
things
people
would
say
and
do
which
they
had
not
said
and
not
done
when
she
was
older
she
had
attached
it
to
maurice
jourdain
and
to
mark
still
and
mamma
to
going
back
to
mamma
after
dover
to
the
unknown
houses
in
morfe
to
maurice
jourdain
coming
then
to
mark
coming
to
lindley
vickers
and
in
the
end
none
of
these
things
had
brought
her
the
happiness
she
had
seemed
to
foresee
in
them
she
knew
only
one
thing
about
perfect
happiness
it
did
hide
it
did
wait
for
you
behind
unknown
doors
there
were
little
happinesses
pleasures
that
came
like
that
the
pleasure
of
feeling
good
when
you
sat
with
maggie
sister
the
pleasure
of
doing
things
for
mamma
or
dorsy
all
the
pleasures
that
had
come
through
the
sutcliffes
the
sutcliffes
went
and
yet
she
had
been
happy
they
had
all
gone
and
yet
she
was
happy
if
you
looked
back
on
any
perfect
happiness
you
saw
that
it
had
not
come
from
the
people
or
the
things
you
thought
it
had
come
from
but
from
somewhere
inside
yourself
when
you
attached
it
to
people
and
things
they
ceased
for
that
moment
to
be
themselves
the
space
they
then
seemed
to
inhabit
was
not
their
own
space
the
time
of
the
wonderful
event
was
not
their
time
they
became
part
of
the
kingdom
of
god
within
you
not
richard
he
had
become
part
of
the
kingdom
of
god
without
ceasing
to
be
himself
that
was
because
she
had
loved
him
more
than
herself
loving
him
more
than
herself
she
had
let
him
go
letting
go
had
somehow
done
the
trick
xi
i
used
to
think
there
was
nothing
i
could
give
up
for
richard
could
i
give
up
this
if
i
had
to
choose
between
losing
richard
and
losing
this
i
suppose
it
would
be
generally
considered
that
i
lost
richard
if
i
had
had
to
choose
seven
years
ago
before
i
knew
i
have
chosen
richard
i
could
have
helped
myself
but
if
i
had
to
choose
now
knowing
what
reality
is
between
losing
richard
in
the
way
i
have
lost
him
and
losing
reality
absolutely
and
for
ever
losing
absolutely
and
for
ever
my
real
self
knowing
that
i
lost
it
if
there
anything
in
it
at
all
losing
my
real
self
would
be
losing
richard
losing
richard
real
self
absolutely
and
for
ever
knowing
reality
is
knowing
that
you
ca
lose
it
that
or
nothing
xii
supposing
there
is
anything
in
it
supposing
supposing
last
night
i
began
thinking
about
it
again
i
stripped
my
soul
i
opened
all
the
windows
and
let
my
thoughts
in
on
the
poor
thing
it
stood
shivering
between
certainty
and
uncertainty
i
tried
to
doubt
away
this
ultimate
passion
and
it
turned
my
doubt
into
its
own
exquisite
sting
the
very
thrill
of
the
adventure
supposing
there
nothing
in
it
nothing
at
all
that
the
risk
you
take
xiii
there
is
any
risk
this
time
it
was
clear
clear
as
the
black
pattern
the
sycamore
makes
on
the
sky
if
it
never
came
again
i
should
remember
the
end
