comes
over
one
an
absolute
necessity
to
move
and
what
is
more
to
move
in
some
particular
direction
a
double
necessity
then
to
get
on
the
move
and
to
know
whither
why
ca
one
sit
still
here
in
sicily
it
is
so
pleasant
the
sunny
ionian
sea
the
changing
jewel
of
calabria
like
a
moved
in
the
light
italy
and
the
panorama
of
christmas
clouds
night
with
the
laying
a
long
luminous
gleam
across
the
sea
as
if
baying
at
us
orion
marching
above
how
the
sirius
looks
at
one
looks
at
one
he
is
the
hound
of
heaven
green
glamorous
and
fierce
and
then
oh
regal
evening
star
hung
westward
flaring
over
the
jagged
dark
precipices
of
tall
sicily
then
etna
that
wicked
witch
resting
her
thick
white
snow
under
heaven
and
slowly
slowly
rolling
her
smoke
they
called
her
the
pillar
of
heaven
the
greeks
it
seems
wrong
at
first
for
she
trails
up
in
a
long
magical
flexible
line
from
the
sea
edge
to
her
blunt
cone
and
does
not
seem
tall
she
seems
rather
low
under
heaven
but
as
one
knows
her
better
oh
awe
and
wizardy
remote
under
heaven
aloof
so
near
yet
never
with
us
the
painters
try
to
paint
her
and
the
photographers
to
photograph
her
in
vain
because
why
because
the
near
ridges
with
their
olives
and
white
houses
these
are
with
us
because
the
and
naxos
under
the
lemon
groves
greek
naxos
deep
under
lemon
groves
etna
skirts
and
these
still
are
our
world
our
own
world
even
the
high
villages
among
the
oaks
on
etna
but
etna
herself
etna
of
the
snow
and
secret
changing
winds
she
is
beyond
a
crystal
wall
when
i
look
at
her
low
white
under
heaven
slowly
rolling
her
orange
smoke
and
giving
sometimes
a
breath
of
flame
then
i
must
look
away
from
earth
into
the
ether
into
the
low
empyrean
and
there
in
that
remote
region
etna
is
alone
if
you
would
see
her
you
must
slowly
take
off
your
eyes
from
the
world
and
go
a
naked
seer
to
the
strange
chamber
of
the
empyrean
pedestal
of
heaven
the
greeks
had
a
sense
of
the
magic
truth
of
things
thank
goodness
one
still
knows
enough
about
them
to
find
one
kinship
at
last
there
are
so
many
photographs
there
are
so
infinitely
many
drawings
and
oil
paintings
which
purport
to
render
etna
but
pedestal
of
heaven
you
must
cross
the
invisible
border
between
the
foreground
which
is
our
own
and
etna
pivot
of
winds
in
lower
heaven
there
is
a
dividing
line
you
must
change
your
state
of
mind
a
metempsychosis
it
is
no
use
thinking
you
can
see
and
behold
etna
and
the
foreground
both
at
once
never
one
or
the
other
foreground
and
a
transcribed
etna
or
etna
pedestal
of
heaven
why
then
must
one
go
why
not
stay
ah
what
a
mistress
this
etna
with
her
strange
winds
prowling
round
her
like
circe
panthers
some
black
some
white
with
her
strange
remote
communications
and
her
terrible
dynamic
exhalations
she
makes
men
mad
such
terrible
vibrations
of
wicked
and
beautiful
electricity
she
throws
about
her
like
a
deadly
net
nay
sometimes
verily
one
can
feel
a
new
current
of
her
demon
magnetism
seize
one
living
tissue
and
change
the
peaceful
life
of
one
active
cells
she
makes
a
storm
in
the
living
plasm
and
a
new
adjustment
and
sometimes
it
is
like
a
madness
this
timeless
grecian
etna
in
her
loveliness
so
lovely
so
lovely
what
a
torturer
not
many
men
can
really
stand
her
without
losing
their
souls
she
is
like
circe
unless
a
man
is
very
strong
she
takes
his
soul
away
from
him
and
leaves
him
not
a
beast
but
an
elemental
creature
intelligent
and
soulless
intelligent
almost
inspired
and
soulless
like
the
etna
sicilians
intelligent
daimons
and
humanly
according
to
us
the
most
stupid
people
on
earth
ach
horror
how
many
men
how
many
races
has
etna
put
to
flight
it
was
she
who
broke
the
quick
of
the
greek
soul
and
after
the
greeks
she
gave
the
romans
the
normans
the
arabs
the
spaniards
the
french
the
italians
even
the
english
she
gave
them
all
their
inspired
hour
and
broke
their
souls
perhaps
it
is
she
one
must
flee
from
at
any
rate
one
must
go
and
at
once
after
having
come
back
only
at
the
end
of
october
already
one
must
dash
away
and
it
is
only
the
third
of
january
and
one
can
not
afford
to
move
yet
there
you
are
at
the
etna
bidding
one
goes
where
does
one
go
there
is
girgenti
by
the
south
there
is
tunis
at
hand
girgenti
and
the
sulphur
spirit
and
the
greek
guarding
temples
to
make
one
madder
never
neither
syracuse
and
the
madness
of
its
great
quarries
tunis
africa
not
yet
not
yet
not
the
arabs
not
yet
naples
rome
florence
no
good
at
all
where
then
where
then
spain
or
sardinia
spain
or
sardinia
sardinia
which
is
like
nowhere
sardinia
which
has
no
history
no
date
no
race
no
offering
let
it
be
sardinia
they
say
neither
romans
nor
phoenicians
greeks
nor
arabs
ever
subdued
sardinia
it
lies
outside
outside
the
circuit
of
civilisation
like
the
basque
lands
sure
enough
it
is
italian
now
with
its
railways
and
its
but
there
is
an
uncaptured
sardinia
still
it
lies
within
the
net
of
this
european
civilisation
but
it
is
landed
yet
and
the
net
is
getting
old
and
tattered
a
good
many
fish
are
slipping
through
the
net
of
the
old
european
civilisation
like
that
great
whale
of
russia
and
probably
even
sardinia
sardinia
then
let
it
be
sardinia
there
is
a
fortnightly
boat
sailing
from
palermo
next
wednesday
three
days
ahead
let
us
go
then
away
from
abhorred
etna
and
the
ionian
sea
and
these
great
stars
in
the
water
and
the
almond
trees
in
bud
and
the
orange
trees
heavy
with
red
fruit
and
these
maddening
exasperating
impossible
sicilians
who
never
knew
what
truth
was
and
have
long
lost
all
notion
of
what
a
human
being
is
a
sort
of
sulphureous
demons
but
let
me
confess
in
parenthesis
that
i
am
not
at
all
sure
whether
i
do
really
prefer
these
demons
to
our
sanctified
humanity
why
does
one
create
such
discomfort
for
oneself
to
have
to
get
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
half
past
one
to
go
and
look
at
the
clock
of
course
this
fraud
of
an
american
watch
has
stopped
with
its
impudent
phosphorescent
face
half
past
one
half
past
one
and
a
dark
january
night
ah
well
half
past
one
and
an
uneasy
sleep
till
at
last
it
is
five
then
light
a
candle
and
get
up
the
dreary
black
morning
the
the
house
looking
ah
well
one
does
all
these
things
for
one
pleasure
so
light
the
charcoal
fire
and
put
the
kettle
on
the
queen
bee
shivering
round
half
dressed
fluttering
her
unhappy
candle
it
fun
she
says
shuddering
great
say
i
grim
as
death
first
fill
the
thermos
with
hot
tea
then
fry
bacon
good
english
bacon
from
malta
a
indeed
and
make
bacon
sandwiches
make
also
sandwiches
of
scrambled
eggs
make
also
bread
and
butter
also
a
little
toast
for
breakfast
and
more
tea
but
ugh
who
wants
to
eat
at
this
unearthly
hour
especially
when
one
is
escaping
from
bewitched
sicily
fill
the
little
bag
we
call
the
kitchenino
methylated
spirit
a
small
aluminium
saucepan
a
two
spoons
two
forks
a
knife
two
aluminium
plates
salt
sugar
tea
what
else
the
thermos
flask
the
various
sandwiches
four
apples
and
a
little
tin
of
butter
so
much
for
the
kitchenino
for
myself
and
the
queen
bee
then
my
knapsack
and
the
handbag
under
the
lid
of
the
night
sky
far
away
at
the
rim
of
the
ionian
sea
the
first
light
like
metal
fusing
so
swallow
the
cup
of
tea
and
the
bit
of
toast
hastily
wash
up
so
that
we
can
find
the
house
decent
when
we
come
back
shut
the
of
the
upper
terrace
and
go
down
lock
the
door
the
upper
half
of
the
house
made
fast
the
sky
and
sea
are
parting
like
an
oyster
shell
with
a
low
red
gape
looking
across
from
the
veranda
at
it
one
shivers
not
that
it
is
cold
the
morning
is
not
at
all
cold
but
the
ominousness
of
it
that
long
red
slit
between
a
dark
sky
and
a
dark
ionian
sea
terrible
old
bivalve
which
has
held
life
between
its
lips
so
long
and
here
at
this
house
we
are
ledged
so
awfully
above
the
dawn
naked
to
it
fasten
the
of
the
lower
veranda
one
wo
fasten
at
all
the
summer
heat
warped
it
one
way
the
masses
of
autumn
rain
warped
it
another
put
a
chair
against
it
lock
the
last
door
and
hide
the
key
sling
the
knapsack
on
one
back
take
the
kitchenino
in
one
hand
and
look
round
the
widening
between
the
purpling
sea
and
the
troubled
sky
a
light
in
the
capucin
convent
across
there
cocks
crowing
and
the
long
howling
hiccuping
melancholy
bray
of
an
ass
all
females
are
dead
all
females
och
och
och
hoooo
ahaa
there
one
left
so
he
ends
on
a
moaning
grunt
of
consolation
this
is
what
the
arabs
tell
us
an
ass
is
howling
when
he
brays
very
dark
under
the
great
carob
tree
as
we
go
down
the
steps
dark
still
the
garden
scent
of
mimosa
and
then
of
jasmine
the
lovely
mimosa
tree
invisible
dark
the
stony
path
the
goat
whinnies
out
of
her
shed
the
broken
roman
tomb
which
lolls
right
over
the
garden
track
does
not
fall
on
me
as
i
slip
under
its
massive
tilt
ah
dark
garden
dark
garden
with
your
olives
and
your
wine
your
medlars
and
mulberries
and
many
almond
trees
your
steep
terraces
ledged
high
up
above
the
sea
i
am
leaving
you
slinking
out
out
between
the
rosemary
hedges
out
of
the
tall
gate
on
to
the
cruel
steep
stony
road
so
under
the
dark
big
eucalyptus
trees
over
the
stream
and
up
towards
the
village
there
i
have
got
so
far
it
is
full
dawn
dawn
not
morning
the
sun
will
not
have
risen
the
village
is
nearly
all
dark
in
the
red
light
and
asleep
still
no
one
at
the
fountain
by
the
capucin
gate
too
dark
still
one
man
leading
a
horse
round
the
corner
of
the
palazzo
corvaia
one
or
two
dark
men
along
the
corso
and
so
over
the
brow
down
the
steep
street
between
the
houses
and
out
to
the
naked
hill
front
this
is
the
of
sicily
nay
the
of
europe
steep
like
a
vast
cliff
a
red
dawn
with
mingled
curdling
dark
clouds
and
some
gold
it
must
be
seven
the
station
down
below
by
the
sea
and
noise
of
a
train
yes
a
train
and
we
still
high
on
the
steep
track
winding
downwards
but
it
is
the
train
from
messina
to
catania
half
an
hour
before
ours
which
is
from
catania
to
messina
so
jolt
and
drop
and
jolt
down
the
old
road
that
winds
on
the
cliff
face
etna
across
there
is
smothered
quite
low
quite
low
in
a
dense
puther
of
clouds
playing
some
devilry
in
private
no
doubt
the
dawn
is
angry
red
and
yellow
above
the
sea
takes
strange
colors
i
hate
the
station
pigmy
drawn
out
there
beside
the
sea
on
this
steep
face
especially
in
the
windless
nooks
the
almond
blossom
is
already
out
in
little
puffs
and
specks
and
stars
it
looks
very
like
bits
of
snow
scattered
by
winter
bits
of
snow
bits
of
blossom
fourth
day
of
the
year
only
blossom
and
etna
indescribably
cloaked
and
secretive
in
her
dense
black
clouds
she
has
wrapped
them
quite
round
her
quite
low
round
her
skirts
at
last
we
are
down
we
pass
the
pits
where
men
are
burning
lime
round
pits
and
are
out
on
the
nothing
can
be
more
depressing
than
an
italian
from
syracuse
to
airolo
it
is
the
same
horrible
dreary
slummy
the
moment
you
approach
a
village
or
any
human
habitation
here
there
is
an
acrid
smell
of
lemon
juice
there
is
a
factory
for
making
citrate
the
houses
flush
on
the
road
under
the
great
face
of
the
hill
open
their
slummy
doors
and
throw
out
dirty
water
and
coffee
dregs
we
walk
over
the
dirty
water
and
coffee
dregs
mules
rattle
past
with
carts
other
people
are
going
to
the
station
we
pass
the
dazio
and
are
there
humanity
is
externally
too
much
alike
internally
there
are
insuperable
differences
so
one
sits
and
thinks
watching
the
people
on
the
station
like
a
line
of
caricatures
between
oneself
and
the
naked
sea
and
the
uneasy
clouding
dawn
you
would
look
in
vain
this
morning
for
the
swarthy
feline
southerner
of
romance
it
might
as
far
as
features
are
concerned
be
an
early
morning
crowd
waiting
for
the
train
on
a
north
london
suburb
station
as
far
as
features
go
for
some
are
fair
and
some
colorless
and
none
racially
typical
the
only
one
that
is
absolutely
like
a
race
caricature
is
a
tall
stout
elderly
fellow
with
spectacles
and
a
short
nose
and
a
bristling
moustache
and
he
is
the
german
of
the
comic
papers
of
twenty
years
ago
but
he
is
pure
sicilian
they
are
mostly
young
fellows
going
up
the
line
to
messina
to
their
job
not
artizans
lower
middle
class
and
externally
so
like
any
other
clerks
and
only
rather
more
shabby
much
less
they
are
lively
they
throw
their
arms
round
one
another
necks
they
all
but
kiss
one
poor
chap
has
had
earache
so
a
black
kerchief
is
tied
round
his
face
and
his
black
hat
is
perched
above
and
a
comic
sight
he
looks
no
one
seems
to
think
so
however
yet
they
view
my
arrival
with
a
knapsack
on
my
back
with
cold
disapprobation
as
unseemly
as
if
i
had
arrived
riding
on
a
pig
i
ought
to
be
in
a
carriage
and
the
knapsack
ought
to
be
a
new
i
know
it
but
am
inflexible
that
is
how
they
are
each
one
thinks
he
is
as
handsome
as
adonis
and
as
fetching
as
don
juan
extraordinary
at
the
same
time
all
flesh
is
grass
and
if
a
few
are
missing
or
if
a
black
hat
perches
above
a
thick
black
and
a
long
excruciated
face
it
is
all
in
the
course
of
nature
they
seize
the
one
by
the
arm
and
in
profound
commiseration
do
you
suffer
are
you
suffering
they
ask
and
that
also
is
how
they
are
so
terribly
physically
all
over
one
another
they
pour
themselves
one
over
the
other
like
so
much
melted
butter
over
parsnips
they
catch
each
other
under
the
chin
with
a
tender
caress
of
the
hand
and
they
smile
with
sunny
melting
tenderness
into
each
other
face
never
in
the
world
have
i
seen
such
melting
gay
tenderness
as
between
casual
sicilians
on
railway
platforms
whether
they
be
young
sicilians
or
huge
stout
sicilians
there
must
be
something
curious
about
the
proximity
of
a
volcano
naples
and
catania
alike
the
men
are
hugely
fat
with
great
macaroni
paunches
they
are
expansive
and
in
a
perfect
drip
of
casual
affection
and
love
but
the
sicilians
are
even
more
wildly
exuberant
and
fat
and
all
over
one
another
than
the
neapolitans
they
never
leave
off
being
amorously
friendly
with
almost
everybody
emitting
a
relentless
physical
familiarity
that
is
quite
bewildering
to
one
not
brought
up
near
a
volcano
this
is
more
true
of
the
middle
classes
than
of
the
lower
the
working
men
are
perforce
thinner
and
less
exuberant
but
they
hang
together
in
clusters
and
can
never
be
physically
near
enough
it
is
only
thirty
miles
to
messina
but
the
train
takes
two
hours
it
winds
and
hurries
and
stops
beside
the
lavender
grey
morning
sea
a
flock
of
goats
trail
over
the
beach
near
the
lapping
wave
edge
dismally
great
wide
deserts
of
stony
run
down
to
the
sea
and
men
on
asses
are
picking
their
way
across
and
women
are
kneeling
by
the
small
washing
clothes
the
lemons
hang
pale
and
innumerable
in
the
thick
lemon
groves
lemon
trees
like
italians
seem
to
be
happiest
when
they
are
touching
one
another
all
round
solid
forests
of
not
very
tall
lemon
trees
lie
between
the
steep
mountains
and
the
sea
on
the
strip
of
plain
women
vague
in
the
orchard
are
picking
the
lemons
lurking
as
if
in
the
undersea
there
are
heaps
of
pale
yellow
lemons
under
the
trees
they
look
like
pale
fires
curious
how
like
fires
the
heaps
of
lemons
look
under
the
shadow
of
foliage
seeming
to
give
off
a
pallid
burning
amid
the
suave
naked
greenish
trunks
when
there
comes
a
cluster
of
orange
trees
the
oranges
are
red
like
coals
among
the
darker
leaves
but
lemons
lemons
innumerable
speckled
like
innumerable
tiny
stars
in
the
green
firmament
of
leaves
so
many
lemons
think
of
all
the
lemonade
crystals
they
will
be
reduced
to
think
of
america
drinking
them
up
next
summer
i
always
wonder
why
such
vast
wide
of
pale
boulders
come
out
of
the
heart
of
the
dramatic
stone
mountains
a
few
miles
to
the
sea
a
few
miles
only
and
never
more
than
a
few
threading
in
wide
enough
for
the
rhine
but
that
is
how
it
is
the
landscape
is
ancient
and
classic
romantic
as
if
it
had
known
days
and
fiercer
rivers
and
more
verdure
steep
craggy
wild
the
land
goes
up
to
its
points
and
precipices
a
tangle
of
heights
but
all
jammed
on
top
of
one
another
and
in
old
landscapes
as
in
old
people
the
flesh
wears
away
and
the
bones
become
prominent
rock
sticks
up
fantastically
the
jungle
of
peaks
in
this
old
sicily
the
sky
is
all
grey
the
straits
are
grey
reggio
just
across
the
water
is
white
looking
under
the
great
dark
toe
of
calabria
the
toe
of
italy
on
aspromonte
there
is
grey
cloud
it
is
going
to
rain
after
such
marvelous
ringing
blue
days
it
is
going
to
rain
what
luck
aspromonte
garibaldi
i
could
always
cover
my
face
when
i
see
it
aspromonte
i
wish
garibaldi
had
been
prouder
why
did
he
go
off
so
humbly
with
his
bag
of
and
a
flea
in
his
ear
when
his
majesty
king
victor
emmanuel
arrived
with
his
little
short
legs
on
the
scene
poor
garibaldi
he
wanted
to
be
a
hero
and
a
dictator
of
free
sicily
well
one
ca
be
a
dictator
and
humble
at
the
same
time
one
must
be
a
hero
which
he
was
and
proud
which
he
was
besides
people
do
nowadays
choose
proud
heroes
for
governors
anything
but
they
prefer
constitutional
monarchs
who
are
paid
servants
and
who
know
it
that
is
democracy
democracy
admires
its
own
servants
and
nothing
else
and
you
could
make
a
real
servant
even
of
garibaldi
only
of
his
majesty
king
victor
emmanuel
so
italy
chose
victor
emmanuel
and
garibaldi
went
off
with
a
corn
bag
and
a
whack
on
the
behind
like
a
humble
ass
it
is
raining
dismally
dismally
raining
and
this
is
messina
coming
oh
horrible
messina
and
renewing
your
youth
like
a
vast
mining
settlement
with
rows
and
streets
and
miles
of
concrete
shanties
squalor
and
a
big
street
with
shops
and
gaps
and
broken
houses
still
just
back
of
the
and
a
dreary
squalid
port
in
a
lovely
harbor
people
do
forget
and
do
recover
the
people
of
messina
seem
to
be
today
what
they
were
nearly
twenty
years
ago
after
the
earthquake
people
who
have
had
a
terrible
shock
and
for
whom
all
life
institutions
are
really
nothing
neither
civilization
nor
purpose
the
meaning
of
everything
all
came
down
with
a
smash
in
that
shuddering
earthquake
and
nothing
remains
but
money
and
the
throes
of
some
sort
of
sensation
messina
between
the
volcanoes
etna
and
stromboli
having
known
the
terror
i
always
dread
coming
near
the
awful
place
yet
i
have
found
the
people
kind
almost
feverishly
so
as
if
they
knew
the
awful
need
for
kindness
raining
raining
hard
clambering
down
on
to
the
wet
platform
and
walking
across
the
wet
lines
to
the
cover
many
human
beings
scurrying
across
the
wet
lines
among
the
wet
trains
to
get
out
into
the
ghastly
town
beyond
thank
heaven
one
need
not
go
out
into
the
town
two
convicts
chained
together
among
the
crowd
and
two
soldiers
the
prisoners
wear
fawny
homespun
clothes
of
cloth
such
as
the
peasants
weave
with
irregularly
occurring
brown
stripes
rather
nice
handmade
rough
stuff
but
linked
together
dear
god
and
those
horrid
caps
on
their
hairless
foreheads
no
hair
probably
they
are
going
to
a
convict
station
on
the
lipari
islands
the
people
take
no
notice
no
but
convicts
are
horrible
creatures
at
least
the
old
one
is
with
his
long
nasty
face
his
long
horrible
face
without
emotions
or
with
emotions
one
can
not
follow
something
cold
sightless
a
sightless
ugly
look
i
should
loathe
to
have
to
touch
him
of
the
other
i
am
not
so
sure
he
is
younger
and
with
dark
eyebrows
but
a
roundish
softish
face
with
a
sort
of
leer
no
evil
is
horrible
i
used
to
think
there
was
no
absolute
evil
now
i
know
there
is
a
great
deal
so
much
that
it
threatens
life
altogether
that
ghastly
abstractness
of
criminals
they
do
any
more
what
other
people
feel
yet
some
horrible
force
drives
them
it
is
a
great
mistake
to
abolish
the
death
penalty
if
i
were
dictator
i
should
order
the
old
one
to
be
hung
at
once
i
should
have
judges
with
sensitive
living
hearts
not
abstract
intellects
and
because
the
instinctive
heart
recognised
a
man
as
evil
i
would
have
that
man
destroyed
quickly
because
good
warm
life
is
now
in
danger
standing
on
messina
station
dreary
dreary
hole
and
watching
the
winter
rain
and
seeing
the
pair
of
convicts
i
must
remember
again
oscar
wilde
on
reading
platform
a
convict
what
a
terrible
mistake
to
let
oneself
be
martyred
by
a
lot
of
canaille
a
man
must
say
his
say
but
me
curious
these
people
are
up
and
down
up
and
down
go
a
pair
of
officials
the
young
one
in
a
black
cap
talks
to
the
elder
in
a
scarlet
cap
and
he
walks
the
young
one
with
a
mad
little
hop
and
his
fingers
fly
as
if
he
wanted
to
scatter
them
to
the
four
winds
of
heaven
and
his
words
go
off
like
fireworks
with
more
than
sicilian
speed
on
and
on
up
and
down
and
his
eye
is
dark
and
excited
and
unseeing
like
the
eye
of
a
fleeing
rabbit
strange
and
beside
itself
is
humanity
what
a
lot
of
officials
you
know
them
by
their
caps
elegant
tubby
little
officials
in
boots
and
caps
tall
ones
in
more
caps
like
angels
in
and
out
of
the
gates
of
heaven
they
thread
in
and
out
of
the
various
doors
as
far
as
i
can
see
there
are
three
scarlet
five
and
a
countless
number
of
principalities
and
powers
in
more
or
less
broken
boots
and
official
caps
they
are
like
bees
round
a
hive
humming
in
an
important
and
occasionally
looking
at
some
paper
or
other
and
extracting
a
little
official
honey
but
the
is
the
affair
of
affairs
to
an
italian
official
life
seems
to
be
one
long
and
animated
conversation
the
italian
word
is
better
interrupted
by
casual
trains
and
telephones
and
besides
the
angels
of
heaven
gates
there
are
the
mere
ministers
porters
etc
these
stand
in
groups
and
talk
socialism
a
slashes
along
swinging
a
couple
of
lamps
bashes
one
against
a
barrow
smash
goes
the
glass
looks
down
as
if
to
say
what
do
you
mean
by
it
glances
over
his
shoulder
to
see
if
any
member
of
the
higher
hierarchies
is
looking
seven
members
of
higher
hierarchies
are
assiduously
not
looking
on
goes
the
minister
with
the
lamp
blithely
another
pane
or
two
gone
la
passengers
have
gathered
again
some
in
hoods
some
in
nothing
youths
in
thin
paltry
clothes
stand
out
in
the
pouring
rain
as
if
they
did
not
know
it
was
raining
one
sees
their
soaked
and
yet
they
do
not
trouble
to
keep
under
shelter
two
large
station
dogs
run
about
and
trot
through
the
standing
trains
just
like
officials
they
climb
up
the
footboard
hop
into
a
train
and
hop
out
casually
when
they
feel
like
it
two
or
three
in
canvas
hats
as
big
as
umbrellas
literally
spreading
like
huge
fins
over
their
shoulders
are
looking
into
more
empty
trains
more
and
more
people
appear
more
and
more
official
caps
stand
about
it
rains
and
rains
the
train
for
palermo
and
the
train
for
syracuse
are
both
an
hour
late
already
coming
from
the
port
though
these
are
the
great
connections
from
rome
loose
locomotives
trundle
back
and
forth
vaguely
like
black
dogs
running
and
turning
back
the
port
is
only
four
minutes
walk
if
it
were
not
raining
so
hard
we
would
go
down
walk
along
the
lines
and
get
into
the
waiting
train
down
there
anybody
may
please
himself
there
is
the
funnel
of
the
great
unwieldy
she
is
just
edging
in
that
means
the
connection
from
the
mainland
at
last
but
it
is
cold
standing
here
we
eat
a
bit
of
bread
and
butter
from
the
kitchenino
in
resignation
after
all
what
is
an
hour
and
a
half
it
might
just
as
easily
be
five
hours
as
it
was
the
last
time
we
came
down
from
rome
and
the
booked
to
syracuse
calmly
left
stranded
in
the
station
of
messina
to
go
no
further
all
get
out
and
find
yourselves
rooms
for
the
night
in
vile
messina
syracuse
or
no
syracuse
malta
boat
or
no
malta
boat
we
are
the
dello
but
there
why
grumble
noi
italiani
siamo
così
buoni
take
it
from
their
own
mouth
ecco
finalmente
the
crowd
is
quite
joyful
as
the
two
express
trains
surge
proudly
in
after
their
creep
plenty
of
room
for
once
though
the
carriage
floor
is
a
puddle
and
the
roof
leaks
this
is
second
class
slowly
with
two
engines
we
grunt
and
chuff
and
twist
to
get
over
the
heights
that
shut
messina
in
from
the
north
coast
the
windows
are
opaque
with
steam
and
drops
of
rain
no
matter
tea
from
the
thermos
flask
to
the
great
interest
of
the
other
two
passengers
who
had
nervously
contemplated
the
unknown
object
ha
says
he
with
joy
seeing
the
hot
tea
come
out
it
has
the
appearance
of
a
bomb
beautiful
hot
says
she
with
real
admiration
all
apprehension
at
once
dissipated
peace
reigns
in
the
wet
compartment
we
run
through
miles
and
miles
of
tunnel
the
italians
have
made
wonderful
roads
and
railways
if
one
rubs
the
window
and
looks
out
lemon
groves
with
many
lemons
houses
new
shanties
a
grey
weary
sea
on
the
right
hand
and
on
the
left
the
dim
grey
complication
of
steep
heights
from
which
issue
stone
of
inordinate
width
and
sometimes
a
road
a
man
on
a
mule
sometimes
near
at
hand
melancholy
goats
leaning
sideways
like
tilted
ships
under
the
eaves
of
some
scabby
house
they
call
the
the
dogs
umbrellas
in
town
you
see
the
dogs
trotting
close
under
the
wall
out
of
the
wet
here
the
goats
lean
like
rock
listing
inwards
to
the
plaster
wall
why
look
out
sicilian
railways
are
all
single
line
hence
the
a
is
where
two
trains
meet
in
a
loop
you
sit
in
a
world
of
rain
and
waiting
until
some
silly
engine
with
four
trucks
puffs
alongside
ecco
la
coincidenza
then
after
a
brief
between
the
two
trains
and
express
and
goods
the
tin
horn
sounds
and
away
we
go
happily
towards
the
next
coincidence
clerks
away
ahead
joyfully
chalk
up
our
hours
of
lateness
on
the
announcement
slate
all
adds
to
the
adventurous
flavour
of
the
journey
dear
heart
we
come
to
a
station
where
we
find
the
other
diretto
the
express
from
the
other
direction
awaiting
our
coincidential
arrival
the
two
trains
run
alongside
one
another
like
two
dogs
meeting
in
the
street
and
snuffing
one
another
every
official
rushes
to
greet
every
other
official
as
if
they
were
all
david
and
jonathan
meeting
after
a
crisis
they
rush
into
each
other
arms
and
exchange
cigarettes
and
the
trains
ca
bear
to
part
and
the
station
ca
bear
to
part
with
us
the
officials
tease
themselves
and
us
with
the
word
meaning
pronto
and
again
pronto
and
shrill
whistles
anywhere
else
a
train
would
go
off
its
tormented
head
but
no
here
only
that
angel
trump
of
an
official
little
horn
will
do
the
business
and
get
them
to
blow
that
horn
if
you
can
they
ca
bear
to
part
rain
continual
rain
a
level
grey
wet
sky
a
level
grey
wet
sea
a
wet
and
misty
train
winding
round
and
round
the
little
bays
diving
through
tunnels
ghosts
of
the
lipari
islands
standing
a
little
way
out
to
sea
heaps
of
shadow
deposited
like
rubbish
heaps
in
the
universal
greyness
enter
more
passengers
an
enormously
large
woman
with
an
extraordinarily
handsome
face
an
extraordinarily
large
man
quite
young
and
a
diminutive
servant
a
little
of
about
thirteen
with
a
beautiful
but
the
juno
it
is
she
who
takes
my
breath
away
she
is
quite
young
in
her
thirties
still
she
has
that
queenly
stupid
beauty
of
a
classic
hera
a
pure
brow
with
level
dark
brows
large
dark
bridling
eyes
a
straight
nose
a
chiselled
mouth
an
air
of
remote
she
sends
one
heart
straight
back
to
pagan
days
and
and
she
is
simply
enormous
like
a
house
she
wears
a
black
toque
with
wings
and
a
black
rabbit
fur
spread
on
her
shoulders
she
edges
her
way
in
carefully
and
once
seated
is
terrified
to
rise
to
her
feet
she
sits
with
that
motionlessness
of
her
type
closed
lips
face
muted
and
expressionless
and
she
expects
me
to
admire
her
i
can
see
that
she
expects
me
to
pay
homage
to
her
beauty
just
to
that
not
homage
to
herself
but
to
her
as
a
she
casts
little
aloof
glances
at
me
under
her
eyelids
it
is
evident
she
is
a
country
beauty
become
a
she
speaks
unwillingly
to
the
other
passenger
a
young
woman
who
also
wears
a
fur
but
without
pretensions
the
husband
of
juno
is
a
bourgeois
young
fellow
and
he
also
is
simply
huge
his
waistcoat
would
almost
make
the
overcoat
of
the
fourth
passenger
the
unshaven
companion
of
the
squinting
young
woman
the
young
jupiter
wears
kid
gloves
a
significant
fact
here
he
too
has
pretensions
but
he
is
quite
affable
with
the
unshaven
one
and
speaks
italian
unaffectedly
whereas
juno
speaks
the
dialect
with
affectation
no
one
takes
any
notice
of
the
little
maid
she
has
a
gentle
virgin
and
those
lovely
grey
sicilian
eyes
that
are
translucent
and
into
which
the
light
sinks
and
becomes
black
sometimes
sometimes
dark
blue
she
carries
the
bag
and
the
extra
coat
of
the
huge
juno
and
sits
on
the
edge
of
the
seat
between
me
and
the
unshaven
juno
having
motioned
her
there
with
a
regal
inclination
of
the
head
the
little
maid
is
rather
frightened
perhaps
she
is
an
orphan
child
probably
her
hair
is
smoothly
parted
and
done
in
two
pigtails
she
wears
no
hat
as
is
proper
for
her
class
on
her
shoulders
one
of
those
little
knitted
grey
that
one
associates
with
orphanages
her
stuff
dress
is
dark
grey
her
boots
are
strong
the
smooth
expressionless
virgin
face
rather
pale
and
touching
rather
frightened
of
the
a
perfect
face
from
a
mediaeval
picture
it
moves
one
strangely
why
it
is
so
unconscious
as
we
are
conscious
like
a
little
muted
animal
it
sits
there
in
distress
she
is
going
to
be
sick
she
goes
into
the
corridor
and
is
sick
very
sick
leaning
her
head
like
a
sick
dog
on
the
jupiter
towers
above
her
not
unkind
and
apparently
feeling
no
repugnance
the
physical
convulsion
of
the
girl
does
not
affect
him
as
it
affects
us
he
looks
on
unmoved
merely
venturing
to
remark
that
she
had
eaten
too
much
before
coming
on
to
the
train
an
obviously
true
remark
after
which
he
comes
and
talks
a
few
to
me
by
and
by
the
creeps
in
again
and
sits
on
the
edge
of
the
seat
facing
juno
but
no
says
juno
if
she
is
sick
she
will
be
sick
over
me
so
jupiter
accommodatingly
changes
places
with
the
who
is
thus
next
to
me
she
sits
on
the
edge
of
the
seat
with
folded
little
red
hands
her
face
pale
and
expressionless
beautiful
the
thin
line
of
her
eyebrows
the
dark
lashes
of
the
silent
pellucid
dark
eyes
silent
motionless
like
a
sick
animal
but
juno
tells
her
to
wipe
her
splashed
boots
the
child
gropes
for
a
piece
of
paper
juno
tells
her
to
take
her
pocket
handkerchief
feebly
the
sick
wipes
her
boots
then
leans
back
but
no
good
she
has
to
go
in
the
corridor
and
be
sick
again
after
a
while
they
all
get
out
queer
to
see
people
so
natural
neither
juno
nor
jupiter
is
in
the
least
unkind
he
even
seems
kind
but
they
are
just
not
upset
not
half
as
upset
as
we
are
the
wanting
to
administer
tea
and
so
on
we
should
have
to
hold
the
child
head
they
just
quite
naturally
leave
it
alone
to
its
convulsions
and
are
neither
distressed
nor
repelled
it
just
is
so
their
naturalness
seems
unnatural
to
us
yet
i
am
sure
it
is
best
sympathy
would
only
complicate
matters
and
spoil
that
strange
remote
virginal
quality
the
says
it
is
largely
stupidity
nobody
washes
out
the
corner
of
the
corridor
though
we
stop
at
stations
long
enough
and
there
are
two
more
hours
journey
train
officials
go
by
and
stare
passengers
step
over
and
stare
stare
and
step
over
somebody
asks
nobody
thinks
of
just
throwing
a
pail
of
water
why
should
they
it
is
all
in
the
course
of
one
begins
to
be
a
bit
chary
of
this
same
nature
in
the
south
enter
two
fresh
passengers
a
man
in
corduroys
and
with
a
gun
and
a
man
with
thick
snowy
hair
and
a
new
hat
and
a
long
black
overcoat
of
smooth
black
cloth
lined
with
rather
ancient
once
expensive
fur
he
is
extremely
proud
of
this
long
black
coat
and
ancient
fur
lining
childishly
proud
he
wraps
it
again
over
his
knee
and
gloats
the
beady
of
the
hunter
look
round
with
pleased
alertness
he
sits
facing
the
one
in
the
overcoat
who
looks
like
the
last
sprout
of
some
norman
blood
the
hunter
in
corduroys
beams
abroad
with
beady
black
eyes
in
a
round
red
face
curious
and
the
other
tucks
his
long
coat
between
his
legs
and
gloats
to
himself
all
to
himself
gloating
and
looking
as
if
he
were
deaf
but
no
he
not
he
wears
muddy
boots
at
termini
it
is
already
business
men
crowd
in
we
get
five
business
men
all
stout
respected
palermitans
the
one
opposite
me
has
whiskers
and
a
patched
traveling
rug
over
his
fat
knees
queer
how
they
bring
that
feeling
of
physical
intimacy
with
them
you
are
never
surprised
if
they
begin
to
take
off
their
boots
or
their
the
whole
world
is
a
sort
of
bedroom
to
them
one
shrinks
but
in
vain
there
is
some
conversation
between
the
beady
hunter
and
the
business
men
also
the
young
one
the
aristocrat
tries
to
stammer
out
at
great
length
a
few
words
as
far
as
i
can
gather
the
young
one
is
mad
or
deranged
and
the
other
the
hunter
is
his
keeper
they
are
traveling
over
europe
together
there
is
some
talk
of
the
count
and
the
hunter
says
the
unfortunate
has
had
an
accident
but
that
is
a
southern
gentleness
presumably
a
form
of
speech
anyhow
it
is
queer
and
the
hunter
in
his
corduroys
with
his
round
ruddy
face
and
strange
eyes
and
thin
black
hair
is
a
puzzle
to
me
even
more
than
the
albino
queer
last
remnant
of
a
baron
as
he
is
they
are
both
muddy
from
the
land
and
pleased
in
a
little
mad
way
of
their
own
but
it
is
six
we
are
at
palermo
capital
of
sicily
the
hunter
slings
his
gun
over
his
shoulder
i
my
knapsack
and
in
the
throng
we
all
disappear
into
the
via
maqueda
palermo
has
two
great
streets
the
via
maqueda
and
the
corso
which
cross
each
other
at
the
via
maqueda
is
narrow
with
narrow
little
pavements
and
is
always
choked
with
carriages
and
it
had
ceased
raining
but
the
narrow
road
was
paved
with
large
convex
slabs
of
hard
stone
inexpressibly
greasy
to
cross
the
via
maqueda
therefore
was
a
feat
however
once
accomplished
it
was
done
the
near
end
of
the
street
was
rather
dark
and
had
mostly
vegetable
shops
abundance
of
vegetables
piles
of
fennel
like
celery
and
great
sheaves
of
young
purplish
artichokes
nodding
their
buds
piles
of
big
radishes
scarlet
and
bluey
purple
carrots
long
strings
of
dried
figs
mountains
of
big
oranges
scarlet
large
peppers
a
last
slice
of
pumpkin
a
great
mass
of
colors
and
vegetable
freshnesses
a
mountain
of
cauliflowers
like
niggers
heads
and
a
mountain
of
ones
next
to
them
how
the
dark
greasy
street
seems
to
beam
with
these
vegetables
all
this
fresh
delicate
flesh
of
luminous
vegetables
piled
there
in
the
air
and
in
the
recesses
of
the
windowless
little
caverns
of
the
shops
and
gleaming
forth
on
the
dark
air
under
the
lamps
the
at
once
wants
to
buy
vegetables
look
look
at
the
broccoli
look
at
the
huge
finocchi
why
do
we
get
them
i
have
some
look
at
those
great
clusters
of
dates
ten
francs
a
kilo
and
we
pay
sixteen
it
monstrous
our
place
is
simply
monstrous
for
all
that
one
does
buy
vegetables
to
take
to
sardinia
cross
the
corso
at
that
decorated
maelstrom
and
of
the
quattro
canti
i
of
course
am
nearly
knocked
down
and
killed
somebody
is
nearly
knocked
down
and
killed
every
two
minutes
but
there
the
carriages
are
light
and
the
horses
curiously
aware
creatures
they
would
never
tread
on
one
the
second
part
of
the
via
maqueda
is
the
swell
part
silks
and
plumes
and
an
infinite
number
of
shirts
and
ties
and
and
mufflers
and
men
fancies
one
realises
here
that
and
is
quite
as
important
as
woman
if
not
more
i
of
course
in
a
rage
the
stares
at
every
rag
and
stitch
and
crosses
and
this
infernal
dark
stream
of
a
via
maqueda
which
as
i
have
said
is
choked
solid
with
strollers
and
carriages
be
it
remembered
that
i
have
on
my
back
the
brown
knapsack
and
the
carries
the
kitchenino
this
is
enough
to
make
a
travelling
menagerie
of
us
if
i
had
my
shirt
sticking
out
behind
and
if
the
had
happened
merely
to
catch
up
the
and
wrap
it
round
her
as
she
came
out
all
well
and
good
but
a
big
brown
knapsack
and
a
basket
with
thermos
flask
etc
no
one
could
not
expect
such
things
to
pass
in
a
southern
capital
but
i
am
and
i
am
sick
of
shops
true
we
have
not
been
in
a
town
for
three
months
but
i
care
for
the
innumerable
in
the
drapery
line
every
wretched
bit
of
chic
is
called
a
fantasia
the
word
goes
lugubriously
to
my
bowels
suddenly
i
am
aware
of
the
darting
past
me
like
a
storm
suddenly
i
see
her
pouncing
on
three
giggling
young
hussies
just
in
front
the
inevitable
black
velveteen
tam
the
inevitable
white
curly
muffler
the
inevitable
flappers
did
you
want
something
have
you
something
to
say
is
there
something
that
amuses
you
you
must
laugh
must
you
oh
laugh
why
why
you
ask
why
have
i
heard
you
oh
you
spik
ingleesh
you
spik
ingleesh
yes
why
that
why
yes
that
why
the
three
giggling
young
hussies
shrink
together
as
if
they
would
all
hide
behind
one
another
after
a
vain
uprearing
and
a
demand
why
madam
tells
them
why
so
they
uncomfortably
squeeze
together
under
the
unexpected
strokes
of
the
italian
and
more
than
retaliation
there
full
in
the
via
maqueda
they
edge
round
one
another
each
attempting
to
get
back
of
the
other
away
from
the
looming
i
perceive
that
this
rotary
motion
is
equivalent
to
a
standstill
so
feel
called
upon
to
say
something
in
the
manly
line
beastly
palermo
i
say
and
throw
a
nonchalant
ignoranti
at
the
end
in
a
tone
of
dismissal
which
does
it
off
they
go
still
huddling
and
shrinking
like
boats
that
are
taking
sails
in
and
peeping
to
see
if
we
are
coming
yes
my
dears
we
are
coming
why
do
you
bother
say
i
to
the
who
is
towering
with
rage
they
followed
us
the
whole
length
of
the
street
with
their
and
their
and
their
spik
and
their
jeering
insolence
but
the
english
are
fools
they
always
put
up
with
this
italian
impudence
which
is
perhaps
but
this
knapsack
it
might
be
full
of
geese
it
would
not
attract
more
attention
however
and
however
it
is
seven
and
the
shops
are
beginning
to
shut
no
more
only
one
lovely
place
raw
ham
boiled
ham
chickens
in
aspic
chicken
sweet
curds
rustic
smoked
sausages
beautiful
fresh
mortadella
huge
mediterranean
red
lobsters
and
those
lobsters
without
claws
so
good
so
good
we
stand
and
cry
it
aloud
but
this
shop
too
is
shutting
i
ask
a
man
for
the
hotel
pantechnico
and
treating
me
in
that
gentle
strangely
tender
southern
manner
he
takes
me
and
shows
me
he
makes
me
feel
such
a
poor
frail
helpless
leaf
a
foreigner
you
know
a
bit
of
an
imbecile
poor
dear
hold
his
hand
and
show
him
the
way
to
sit
in
the
room
of
this
young
american
woman
with
its
blue
hangings
and
talk
and
drink
tea
till
midnght
ah
these
naïve
americans
they
are
a
good
deal
older
and
shrewder
than
we
once
it
nears
the
point
and
they
all
seem
to
feel
as
if
the
world
were
coming
to
an
end
and
they
are
so
truly
generous
of
their
hospitality
in
this
cold
world
ii
the
sea
the
fat
old
porter
knocks
ah
me
once
more
it
is
dark
get
up
again
before
dawn
a
dark
sky
outside
cloudy
the
thrilling
tinkle
of
innumerable
as
the
first
flock
enters
the
city
such
a
rippling
sound
well
it
must
be
morning
even
if
one
shivers
at
it
and
at
least
it
does
not
rain
that
pale
bluish
theatrical
light
outside
of
the
first
dawn
and
a
cold
wind
we
come
on
to
the
wide
desolate
quay
the
curve
of
the
harbour
panormus
that
horrible
of
a
cold
sea
out
there
and
here
port
mud
greasy
and
fish
and
refuse
the
american
girl
is
with
us
wrapped
in
her
sweater
a
coarse
cold
world
she
seems
as
if
she
would
melt
away
before
it
but
these
frail
creatures
what
a
lot
they
can
go
through
illustration
map
for
sea
and
sardinia
across
the
great
wide
badly
paved
despairing
road
of
the
quay
side
and
to
the
sea
there
lies
our
steamer
over
there
in
the
of
the
basin
half
visible
that
one
who
is
smoking
her
cigarette
says
the
porter
she
looks
little
beside
the
huge
of
who
is
lying
up
next
her
our
is
hemmed
in
by
many
empty
boats
huddled
to
the
side
of
the
quay
she
works
her
way
out
like
a
sheepdog
working
his
way
out
of
a
flock
of
sheep
or
like
a
boat
through
we
are
on
the
open
basin
the
rower
stands
up
and
pushes
the
oars
from
him
he
gives
a
long
melancholy
cry
to
someone
on
the
quay
the
water
goes
against
the
urging
bows
the
wind
is
chill
the
fantastic
peaks
behind
palermo
show
in
a
sky
the
dawn
seems
reluctant
to
come
our
steamer
still
smokes
her
cigarette
meaning
the
across
there
so
one
sits
still
and
crosses
the
level
space
of
water
masts
of
and
spars
cluster
on
the
left
on
the
undarkening
sky
climb
up
climb
up
this
is
our
ship
up
we
go
up
the
ladder
oh
but
says
the
american
girl
is
she
small
is
she
impossibly
small
oh
my
will
you
go
in
such
a
little
thing
oh
dear
thirty
two
hours
in
such
a
little
boat
why
no
i
would
care
for
it
at
all
a
bunch
of
stewards
cooks
waiters
engineers
and
mostly
in
black
canvas
jackets
nobody
else
on
the
ship
a
little
black
bunch
of
loutish
crew
with
nothing
to
do
and
we
the
first
passengers
served
up
to
be
jeered
at
there
you
are
in
the
grey
light
who
is
going
we
two
the
signorina
is
not
going
tickets
these
are
casual
proletarian
manners
we
are
taken
into
the
one
long
room
with
a
long
table
and
many
doors
alternate
panels
having
a
picture
inserted
a
goddess
of
white
marble
on
a
blue
ground
like
a
hygeia
advertisement
one
of
the
plain
panels
opens
our
cabin
oh
dear
why
it
is
as
big
as
a
however
will
you
get
in
cries
the
american
girl
one
at
a
time
say
i
but
it
the
tiniest
place
i
saw
it
really
was
tiny
one
had
to
get
into
a
bunk
to
shut
the
door
that
did
not
matter
to
me
i
am
no
titanic
american
i
pitched
the
knapsack
on
one
bunk
the
kitchenino
on
the
other
and
we
shut
the
door
the
cabin
disappeared
into
a
panel
of
the
long
subterranean
why
is
this
the
only
place
you
got
to
sit
in
cried
the
american
girl
but
how
perfectly
awful
no
air
and
so
dark
and
smelly
why
i
never
saw
such
a
boat
will
you
really
go
will
you
really
the
was
truly
rather
subterranean
and
stuffy
with
nothing
but
a
long
table
and
an
uncanny
company
of
chairs
seated
thereat
and
no
outlet
to
the
air
at
all
but
it
was
not
so
bad
otherwise
to
me
who
have
never
been
out
of
europe
those
panels
and
ebony
curves
and
those
hygeias
they
went
all
round
even
round
the
curve
at
the
dim
distant
end
and
back
up
the
near
side
yet
how
beautiful
old
is
how
very
lovely
with
the
ebony
curves
of
the
door
arch
there
was
a
wonderful
victorian
glow
in
it
and
a
certain
splendour
even
one
could
bear
the
hygeias
let
in
under
glass
the
colour
was
right
that
and
white
in
such
lovely
gold
lustre
there
was
a
certain
homely
grandeur
still
in
the
days
when
this
ship
was
built
a
richness
of
choice
material
and
hygeias
greek
goddesses
on
advertisement
placards
yet
they
advertisements
that
was
what
really
worried
me
they
never
had
been
perhaps
weego
health
salts
stole
her
later
we
have
no
coffee
that
goes
without
saying
nothing
doing
so
early
the
crew
still
stands
in
a
gang
exactly
like
a
gang
of
louts
at
a
and
they
got
the
street
all
to
themselves
this
ship
we
climb
to
the
upper
deck
she
is
a
long
slender
old
steamer
with
one
little
funnel
and
she
seems
so
deserted
now
that
one
ca
see
the
gang
of
the
casual
crew
they
are
just
below
our
ship
is
deserted
the
dawn
is
wanly
blueing
the
sky
is
a
curdle
of
cloud
there
is
a
bit
of
pale
gold
eastwards
beyond
monte
pellegrino
the
wind
blows
across
the
harbour
the
hills
behind
palermo
prick
up
their
ears
on
the
the
city
lies
unseen
near
us
and
level
there
a
big
ship
is
coming
in
the
naples
boat
and
the
little
boats
keep
putting
off
from
the
near
quay
and
coming
to
us
we
watch
a
stout
officer
cavalry
in
with
a
big
cloak
lined
with
scarlet
the
scarlet
lining
keeps
flashing
he
has
a
little
beard
and
his
uniform
is
not
quite
clean
he
has
big
wooden
chests
tied
with
rope
for
luggage
poor
and
of
no
class
yet
that
scarlet
splendid
lining
and
the
spurs
it
seems
a
pity
they
must
go
yet
so
it
is
he
goes
forward
when
the
dock
porter
has
hoisted
those
wooden
boxes
no
yet
boats
still
keep
coming
here
is
the
commissariat
various
sides
of
kid
ready
for
roasting
various
chickens
fennel
like
celery
wine
in
a
bottiglione
new
bread
packages
hand
them
up
hand
them
up
good
food
cries
the
in
anticipation
it
must
be
getting
near
time
to
go
two
more
passengers
young
thick
men
in
black
standing
up
in
the
stern
of
a
little
boat
their
hands
in
their
pockets
looking
a
little
cold
about
the
chin
not
quite
italian
too
sturdy
and
manly
sardinians
from
cagliari
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
go
down
from
the
chill
it
is
growing
full
day
bits
of
pale
gold
are
flying
among
delicate
but
cold
flakes
of
cloud
from
the
east
over
monte
pellegrino
bits
of
very
new
turquoise
sky
come
out
palermo
on
the
left
crouches
upon
her
a
little
desolate
disorderly
along
her
quay
front
even
from
here
we
can
see
the
yellow
carts
rattling
slowly
the
mules
nodding
their
high
weird
plumes
of
scarlet
along
the
broad
weary
oh
painted
carts
of
sicily
with
all
history
on
your
panels
arrives
an
individual
at
our
side
the
captain
fears
it
will
not
be
possible
to
start
there
is
much
wind
outside
much
wind
how
they
to
come
up
with
alarming
disquieting
or
annoying
news
the
joy
it
gives
them
what
satisfaction
on
all
the
faces
of
course
all
the
other
loafers
are
watching
us
the
loungers
of
this
deck
but
we
have
been
many
times
bitten
ah
ma
say
i
looking
at
the
sky
not
so
much
wind
as
all
that
an
air
of
quiet
shrugging
indifference
is
most
effectual
as
if
you
knew
all
about
it
a
good
deal
more
than
they
knew
ah
si
molto
vento
molto
vento
outside
outside
with
a
long
face
and
a
dramatic
gesture
he
points
out
of
the
harbour
to
the
grey
sea
i
too
look
out
of
the
harbour
at
the
pale
line
of
sea
beyond
the
mole
but
i
do
not
trouble
to
answer
and
my
eye
is
calm
so
he
goes
away
only
half
triumphant
things
seem
to
get
worse
and
worse
cries
the
american
friend
what
will
you
do
on
such
a
boat
if
you
have
an
awful
time
out
in
the
mediterranean
here
oh
no
will
you
risk
it
really
wo
you
go
from
cività
vecchia
how
awful
it
will
be
cries
the
looking
round
the
grey
harbour
the
many
masts
clustering
in
the
grey
sky
on
the
right
the
big
naples
boat
turning
her
posterior
to
the
a
little
way
off
and
cautiously
budging
backwards
the
almost
entirely
harbour
the
bits
of
blue
and
flying
white
cloud
overhead
the
little
boats
like
beetles
scuttling
hither
and
thither
across
the
basin
the
thick
crowd
on
the
quay
come
to
meet
the
naples
boat
time
time
the
american
friend
must
go
she
bids
us
goodbye
more
than
sympathetically
i
shall
be
awfully
interested
to
hear
how
you
get
on
so
down
the
side
she
goes
the
boatman
wants
twenty
francs
wants
more
but
does
get
it
he
gets
ten
which
is
five
too
much
and
so
sitting
rather
small
and
pinched
and
huddled
in
her
sweater
she
bibbles
over
the
ripply
water
to
the
distant
stone
steps
we
wave
farewell
but
other
traffic
comes
between
us
and
the
feeling
nervous
is
rather
cross
because
the
american
friend
ideas
of
luxury
have
put
us
in
such
a
poor
light
we
feel
like
the
poorest
of
poor
relations
our
ship
is
hooting
for
all
she
worth
an
important
comes
surging
up
the
rope
hawsers
are
being
wound
clankily
in
seagulls
they
are
never
very
many
in
the
mediterranean
seagulls
whirl
like
a
few
flakes
of
snow
in
the
upper
chill
air
clouds
spin
and
without
knowing
it
we
are
evaporating
away
from
the
shore
from
our
mooring
between
the
great
of
and
another
big
black
steamer
that
lies
like
a
wall
we
breathe
towards
this
second
black
wall
of
steamer
distinctly
and
of
course
an
individual
in
an
official
cap
is
standing
on
the
bottom
of
our
departure
ladder
just
above
the
water
yelling
barca
barca
shouting
for
a
boat
and
an
old
man
on
the
sea
stands
up
to
his
oars
and
comes
pushing
his
clumsy
boat
with
gathering
speed
between
us
and
the
other
black
wall
there
he
stands
away
below
there
small
firing
his
clumsy
boat
along
remote
as
if
in
a
picture
on
the
dark
green
water
and
our
black
side
insidiously
and
evilly
aspires
to
the
other
huge
black
wall
he
rows
in
the
canyon
between
and
is
nearly
here
when
lo
the
individual
on
the
bottom
step
turns
in
the
other
direction
another
boat
from
the
open
basin
is
sweeping
up
it
is
a
race
she
is
near
she
is
nearer
she
is
up
with
a
curvet
the
boat
from
the
open
rounds
up
at
the
ladder
the
boat
between
the
gulf
backs
its
oars
the
official
individual
shouts
and
waves
the
old
man
backing
his
oars
in
the
gulf
below
yells
expostulation
the
boat
from
the
open
carries
off
its
prey
our
ship
begins
slowly
to
working
her
screw
the
man
in
the
gulf
of
green
water
rows
for
his
life
we
are
floating
into
the
open
basin
slowly
slowly
we
turn
round
and
as
the
ship
turns
our
hearts
turn
palermo
fades
from
our
consciousness
the
naples
boat
the
disembarking
crowds
the
rattling
carriages
to
the
land
the
great
of
all
fades
from
our
heart
we
see
only
the
open
gap
of
the
harbour
entrance
and
the
level
void
of
the
sea
beyond
there
are
wisps
of
gleamy
light
out
there
and
out
there
our
heart
watches
though
palermo
is
near
us
just
behind
we
look
round
and
see
it
all
behind
us
but
already
it
is
gone
gone
from
our
heart
the
fresh
wind
the
gleamy
wisps
of
light
the
running
open
sea
beyond
the
harbour
bars
and
so
we
steam
out
and
almost
at
once
the
ship
begins
to
take
a
long
slow
dizzy
dip
and
a
fainting
swoon
upwards
and
a
long
slow
dizzy
dip
slipping
away
from
beneath
one
the
turns
pale
up
comes
the
deck
in
that
fainting
swoon
backwards
then
down
it
fades
in
that
indescribable
slither
forwards
it
is
all
quite
gentle
quite
quite
gentle
but
oh
so
long
and
so
slow
and
so
dizzy
rather
pleasant
say
i
to
the
yes
rather
lovely
she
answers
wistfully
to
tell
the
truth
there
is
something
in
the
long
slow
lift
of
the
ship
and
her
long
slow
slide
forwards
which
makes
my
heart
beat
with
joy
it
is
the
motion
of
freedom
to
feel
her
come
up
then
slide
slowly
forward
with
a
sound
of
the
smashing
of
waters
is
like
the
magic
gallop
of
the
sky
the
magic
gallop
of
elemental
space
that
long
slow
waveringly
rhythmic
rise
and
fall
of
the
ship
with
waters
snorting
as
it
were
from
her
nostrils
oh
god
what
a
joy
it
is
to
the
wild
innermost
soul
one
is
free
at
last
and
lilting
in
a
slow
flight
of
the
elements
winging
outwards
oh
god
to
be
free
of
all
the
life
the
horror
of
human
tension
the
absolute
insanity
of
machine
persistence
the
agony
which
a
train
is
to
me
really
and
the
agony
of
a
life
among
tense
resistant
people
on
land
and
then
to
feel
the
long
slow
lift
and
drop
of
this
almost
empty
ship
as
she
took
the
waters
ah
god
liberty
liberty
elemental
liberty
i
wished
in
my
soul
the
voyage
might
last
forever
that
the
sea
had
no
end
that
one
might
float
in
this
wavering
tremulous
yet
long
and
surging
pulsation
while
ever
time
lasted
space
never
exhausted
and
no
turning
back
no
looking
back
even
the
ship
was
almost
empty
save
of
course
for
the
louts
who
hung
about
just
below
on
the
deck
itself
we
stood
alone
on
the
little
promenade
deck
which
has
old
oak
seats
with
old
carved
little
lions
at
the
ends
for
and
a
little
cabin
mysteriously
shut
which
much
peeping
determined
as
the
wireless
office
and
the
operator
little
curtained
cold
fresh
wind
a
translucent
rolling
sea
on
which
the
wake
rose
in
snapping
foam
and
sicily
on
the
left
monte
pellegrino
a
huge
inordinate
mass
of
pinkish
rock
hardly
crisped
with
the
faintest
vegetation
looming
up
to
heaven
from
the
sea
strangely
large
in
mass
and
bulk
monte
pellegrino
looks
and
bare
like
a
sahara
in
heaven
and
these
coasts
of
sicily
are
very
imposing
terrific
fortifying
the
interior
and
again
one
gets
the
feeling
that
age
has
worn
them
bare
as
if
old
old
civilisations
had
worn
away
and
exhausted
the
soil
leaving
a
terrifying
blankness
of
rock
as
at
syracuse
in
plateaus
and
here
in
a
great
mass
there
seems
hardly
any
one
on
board
but
ourselves
we
alone
on
the
little
promenade
deck
strangely
lonely
floating
on
a
bare
old
ship
past
the
great
bare
shores
on
a
rolling
sea
stooping
and
rising
in
the
wind
the
wood
of
the
fittings
is
all
bare
and
the
cabin
the
seats
even
the
little
lions
of
the
seats
the
paint
wore
away
long
ago
and
this
timber
will
never
see
paint
any
more
strange
to
put
one
hand
on
the
old
oaken
wood
so
good
old
oak
i
swear
it
grew
in
england
and
everything
so
carefully
done
so
solidly
and
everlastingly
i
look
at
the
lions
with
the
oaken
pins
through
their
paws
clinching
them
down
and
their
little
mouths
open
they
are
as
solid
as
they
were
in
victorian
days
as
immovable
they
will
never
wear
away
what
a
joy
in
the
careful
thorough
manly
everlasting
work
put
into
a
ship
at
least
into
this
vessel
every
bit
of
this
old
oak
wood
so
sound
so
beautiful
and
the
whole
welded
together
with
joints
and
wooden
pins
far
more
beautifully
and
livingly
than
iron
welds
rustless
old
wood
rustless
as
flesh
is
rustless
and
as
iron
never
can
be
she
rides
so
well
she
takes
the
sea
so
beautifully
as
a
matter
of
course
various
members
of
the
crew
wander
past
to
look
at
us
this
little
promenade
deck
is
over
the
quarters
full
in
the
stern
so
we
see
first
one
head
then
another
come
up
the
ladder
mostly
bare
heads
and
one
figure
after
another
slouches
past
smoking
a
cigarette
all
crew
at
last
the
stops
one
of
them
it
is
what
they
are
all
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
talk
and
asks
if
the
weird
object
on
the
top
of
pellegrino
is
a
ruin
could
there
be
a
more
touristy
question
no
it
is
the
semaphore
station
slap
in
the
eye
for
the
she
does
mind
however
and
the
member
of
the
crew
proceeds
to
converse
he
is
a
weedy
a
palermitan
he
wears
faded
blue
and
informs
us
he
is
the
ship
carpenter
happily
unemployed
for
the
rest
of
his
life
apparently
and
taking
it
as
rather
less
than
his
dues
the
ship
once
did
the
course
a
very
important
course
in
the
old
days
of
the
general
navigation
company
the
general
navigation
company
sold
her
for
eighty
thousand
liras
years
ago
and
now
she
was
worth
two
million
we
pretend
to
believe
but
i
make
a
poor
show
i
am
thoroughly
sick
to
death
of
the
sound
of
liras
no
man
can
overhear
ten
words
of
italian
today
without
two
thousand
or
two
million
or
ten
or
twenty
or
two
liras
flying
like
venomous
mosquitoes
round
his
ears
liras
liras
liras
nothing
else
romantic
poetic
italy
is
gone
remains
an
italy
smothered
in
the
filthy
smother
of
innumerable
lira
notes
ragged
unsavoury
paper
money
so
thick
upon
the
air
that
one
breathes
it
like
some
greasy
fog
behind
this
greasy
fog
some
people
may
still
see
the
italian
sun
i
find
it
hard
work
through
this
murk
of
liras
you
peer
at
michael
angelo
and
at
botticelli
and
the
rest
and
see
them
all
as
through
a
glass
darkly
for
heavy
around
you
is
italy
atmosphere
darkly
pressing
you
squeezing
you
milling
you
into
dirty
paper
notes
king
harry
was
lucky
that
they
only
wanted
to
coin
him
into
gold
italy
wants
to
mill
you
into
filthy
paper
liras
another
head
and
a
black
alpaca
jacket
and
a
serviette
this
time
to
tell
us
coffee
is
ready
not
before
it
is
time
too
we
go
down
into
the
subterranean
and
sit
on
the
chairs
while
the
ship
does
the
trot
under
us
and
we
drink
a
couple
of
cups
of
and
eat
a
piece
of
bread
and
butter
at
least
one
of
the
innumerable
members
of
the
crew
gives
me
one
cup
then
casts
me
off
it
is
most
obviously
his
intention
that
i
shall
get
no
more
because
of
course
the
innumerable
members
of
the
crew
could
all
just
do
with
another
coffee
and
milk
however
though
the
ship
heaves
and
the
alpaca
coats
cluster
menacingly
in
the
doorway
i
balance
my
way
to
the
tin
buffet
and
seize
the
coffee
pot
and
the
milk
pot
and
am
quite
successful
in
administering
to
the
and
myself
having
restored
the
said
vessels
to
their
tin
altar
i
resume
my
spin
chair
at
the
long
and
desert
board
the
and
i
are
alone
save
that
in
the
distance
a
very
fat
back
with
collar
sits
sideways
and
a
fat
hand
disposes
of
various
papers
he
is
part
of
the
table
of
course
the
tall
lean
alpaca
jacket
with
a
face
of
yellow
stone
and
a
big
black
moustache
moves
from
the
outer
doorway
glowers
at
our
filled
cups
and
goes
to
the
tin
altar
and
touches
the
handles
of
the
two
vessels
just
touches
them
to
an
arrangement
as
one
who
should
say
these
are
mine
what
dirty
foreigner
dares
help
himself
as
quickly
as
possible
we
stagger
up
from
the
long
dungeon
where
the
alpaca
jackets
are
swooping
like
upon
the
coffee
pots
into
the
air
there
the
carpenter
is
waiting
for
us
like
a
spider
is
the
sea
a
little
quieter
says
the
wistfully
she
is
growing
paler
no
signora
how
should
it
be
says
the
carpenter
the
wind
is
waiting
for
us
behind
cape
gallo
you
see
that
cape
he
points
to
a
tall
black
in
the
sea
ahead
when
we
get
to
that
cape
we
get
the
wind
and
the
sea
here
he
makes
a
gesture
it
is
moderate
ugh
says
the
turning
paler
i
going
to
lie
down
she
disappears
the
carpenter
finding
me
stony
ground
goes
forward
and
i
see
him
melting
into
the
crowd
of
the
innumerable
crew
that
hovers
on
the
passage
by
the
kitchen
and
the
engines
the
clouds
are
flying
fast
overhead
and
sharp
and
isolated
come
drops
of
rain
so
that
one
thinks
it
must
be
spray
but
no
it
is
a
handful
of
rain
the
ship
swishes
and
sinks
forward
gives
a
hollow
thudding
and
rears
slowly
backward
along
this
pinkish
lofty
coast
of
sicily
that
is
just
retreating
into
a
bay
from
the
open
sea
comes
the
rain
come
the
long
waves
no
shelter
one
must
go
down
the
lies
quietly
in
her
bunk
the
is
stale
like
a
passage
on
the
underground
railway
no
shelter
save
near
the
kitchen
and
the
engines
where
there
is
a
bit
of
warmth
the
cook
is
busy
cleaning
fish
making
the
whiting
bite
their
tails
venomously
at
a
little
board
just
outside
his
a
slow
stream
of
swilkers
back
and
forth
along
the
ship
side
a
gang
of
the
crew
leans
near
me
a
larger
gang
further
down
heaven
knows
what
they
can
all
be
but
they
never
do
anything
but
stand
in
gangs
and
talk
and
eat
and
smoke
cigarettes
they
are
mostly
young
mostly
palermitan
with
a
couple
of
unmistakable
neapolitans
having
the
peculiar
neapolitan
good
looks
the
chiselled
cheek
the
little
black
moustache
the
large
eyes
but
they
chew
with
their
cheeks
bulged
out
and
laugh
with
their
fine
noses
the
whole
gang
looks
continually
sideways
nobody
ever
commands
them
there
seems
to
be
absolutely
no
control
only
the
fat
engineer
in
grey
linen
looks
as
clean
and
as
competent
as
his
own
machinery
queer
how
puts
the
pride
and
into
a
man
the
rain
over
i
go
and
squat
against
the
canvas
that
is
spread
over
the
arched
on
the
small
promenade
deck
sitting
on
the
seat
that
is
fixed
to
the
sides
the
wind
is
cold
there
are
snatches
of
sun
and
spits
of
rain
the
big
cape
has
come
and
is
being
left
behind
we
are
heading
for
a
cape
like
a
cloud
in
the
grey
air
a
dimness
comes
over
one
mind
a
sort
of
stupefaction
owing
to
the
wind
and
the
relentless
of
the
ship
not
a
sickness
but
a
sort
of
dim
faintness
so
much
motion
such
moving
powerful
air
and
withal
a
constant
triumph
in
the
long
slow
of
the
ship
a
great
loud
bell
midday
and
the
crew
going
to
eat
rushing
to
eat
after
some
time
we
are
summoned
the
signora
is
eating
asks
the
waiter
eagerly
hoping
she
is
not
yes
she
is
eating
say
i
fetch
the
from
her
berth
rather
wanly
she
comes
and
gets
into
her
spin
chair
bash
comes
a
huge
plate
of
thick
oily
cabbage
soup
very
full
swilkering
over
the
sides
we
do
what
we
can
with
it
so
does
the
third
passenger
a
young
woman
who
never
wears
a
hat
thereby
admitting
herself
simply
as
one
of
the
people
but
who
has
an
expensive
complicated
dress
thin
silk
stockings
and
suede
shoes
she
is
handsome
sturdy
with
large
dark
eyes
and
a
robust
frank
manner
far
too
robustly
downright
for
italy
she
is
from
cagliari
and
ca
do
much
with
the
cabbage
soup
and
tells
the
waiter
so
in
her
deep
voice
in
the
doorway
hovers
a
little
cloud
of
alpaca
jackets
grinning
faintly
with
malignant
anticipation
of
food
hoping
like
we
shall
be
too
ill
to
eat
away
goes
the
soup
and
appears
a
massive
yellow
omelette
like
some
log
of
bilious
wood
it
is
hard
and
heavy
and
cooked
in
the
usual
olive
oil
the
young
woman
does
have
much
truck
with
it
neither
do
we
to
the
triumph
of
the
who
see
the
yellow
monster
borne
to
their
altar
after
which
a
long
long
slab
of
the
inevitable
meat
cut
into
innumerable
slices
tasting
of
dead
nothingness
and
having
a
thick
sauce
of
brown
neutrality
sufficient
for
twelve
people
at
least
this
with
masses
of
greenish
cauliflower
liberally
weighted
with
oil
on
a
ship
that
was
already
heaving
its
heart
out
made
up
the
dinner
accumulating
malevolent
triumph
among
the
in
the
passage
so
on
to
a
dessert
of
oranges
pears
with
wooden
hearts
and
thick
yellowish
flesh
and
apples
then
coffee
and
we
had
sat
through
it
which
is
something
the
alpaca
buzzed
over
the
masses
of
food
that
went
back
on
the
dishes
to
the
tin
altar
surely
it
had
been
made
deliberately
so
that
we
should
not
eat
it
the
cagliarese
young
woman
talked
to
us
yes
she
broke
into
that
awful
language
which
the
italians
the
quite
ordinary
ones
call
french
and
which
they
insist
on
speaking
for
their
own
glorification
yea
when
they
get
to
heaven
gate
they
will
ask
peter
for
oon
bigliay
pour
ung
trozzième
classe
fortunately
or
unfortunately
her
inquisitiveness
got
the
better
of
her
and
she
fell
into
her
native
italian
what
were
we
where
did
we
come
from
where
were
we
going
were
we
going
had
we
any
children
did
we
want
any
etc
after
every
answer
she
nodded
her
head
and
said
ahu
and
watched
us
with
energetic
dark
eyes
then
she
ruminated
over
our
nationalities
and
said
to
the
unseeing
witnesses
una
bella
coppia
a
fine
couple
as
at
the
moment
we
felt
neither
beautiful
nor
coupled
we
only
looked
greener
the
grim
coming
up
to
ask
us
again
if
we
were
going
to
have
a
little
wine
she
lapsed
into
her
french
which
was
most
difficult
to
follow
and
she
said
that
on
a
one
must
eat
one
must
eat
if
only
a
little
but
and
she
lapsed
into
italian
one
must
by
no
means
drink
wine
no
no
one
want
to
said
i
sadly
whereupon
the
grim
whom
of
course
we
had
cheated
out
of
the
bottle
we
refused
to
have
opened
for
us
said
with
a
lost
sarcasm
that
wine
made
a
man
of
a
man
etc
i
was
too
weary
of
that
underground
however
all
i
knew
was
that
he
wanted
wine
wine
wine
and
we
had
ordered
any
he
did
care
for
food
the
cagliarese
told
us
she
came
now
from
naples
and
her
husband
was
following
in
a
few
days
he
was
doing
business
in
naples
i
nearly
asked
if
he
was
a
little
this
being
the
italian
for
profiteer
but
refrained
in
time
so
the
two
ladies
retired
to
lie
down
i
went
and
sat
under
my
tarpaulin
i
felt
very
dim
and
only
a
bit
of
myself
and
i
dozed
blankly
the
afternoon
grew
more
sunny
the
ship
turned
southwards
and
with
the
wind
and
waves
behind
it
became
much
warmer
much
smoother
the
sun
had
the
lovely
strong
winey
warmth
golden
over
the
sea
the
old
looked
almost
white
the
afternoon
was
sweet
upon
the
sea
and
in
the
sunshine
and
the
swishing
of
the
sea
the
speedier
running
of
the
empty
ship
i
slept
a
warm
sweet
hour
away
and
awoke
new
to
see
ahead
pale
uplooming
islands
upon
the
right
the
windy
egades
and
on
the
right
a
mountain
or
high
conical
hill
with
buildings
on
the
summit
and
in
front
against
the
sea
still
rather
far
away
buildings
rising
upon
a
quay
within
a
harbor
and
a
mole
and
a
castle
forward
to
sea
all
small
and
far
away
like
a
view
the
buildings
were
square
and
fine
there
was
something
impressive
magical
under
the
far
sunshine
and
the
keen
wind
the
square
and
buildings
waiting
far
off
waiting
like
a
lost
city
in
a
story
a
rip
van
winkle
city
i
knew
it
was
trapani
the
western
port
of
sicily
under
the
western
sun
and
the
hill
near
us
was
mount
eryx
i
had
never
seen
it
before
so
i
had
imagined
a
mountain
in
the
sky
but
it
was
only
a
hill
with
undistinguishable
cluster
of
a
village
on
the
summit
where
even
now
cold
wisps
of
vapour
caught
they
say
it
is
feet
high
still
it
looks
only
a
hill
but
why
in
the
name
of
heaven
should
my
heart
stand
still
as
i
watch
that
hill
which
rises
above
the
sea
it
is
the
etna
of
the
west
but
only
a
hill
to
men
it
must
have
had
a
magic
almost
greater
than
etna
watching
africa
africa
showing
her
coast
on
clear
days
africa
the
dreaded
and
the
great
of
the
summit
in
the
world
that
was
venus
of
the
aborigines
older
than
greek
aphrodite
venus
of
the
aborigines
from
her
looking
at
africa
beyond
the
egatian
isles
the
the
smiling
astarte
this
one
of
the
world
centres
older
than
old
and
the
watching
africa
laughing
the
at
this
centre
of
an
ancient
world
i
confess
my
heart
stood
still
but
is
mere
historical
fact
so
strong
that
what
one
learns
in
bits
from
books
can
move
one
so
or
does
the
very
word
call
an
echo
out
of
the
dark
blood
it
seems
so
to
me
it
seems
to
me
from
the
darkest
recesses
of
my
blood
comes
a
terrible
echo
at
the
name
of
mount
eryx
something
quite
unaccountable
the
name
of
athens
hardly
moves
me
at
eryx
my
darkness
quivers
eryx
looking
west
into
africa
sunset
there
is
a
in
the
little
cabin
against
which
i
lean
the
wireless
operator
is
busy
communicating
with
trapani
no
doubt
he
is
a
fat
young
man
with
fairish
curly
hair
and
an
important
bearing
give
a
man
control
of
some
machine
and
at
once
his
air
of
importance
and
dignity
develops
one
of
the
unaccountable
members
of
the
crew
lounges
in
the
little
doorway
like
a
chicken
on
one
foot
having
nothing
to
do
the
girl
from
cagliari
comes
up
with
two
young
men
also
sardinians
by
their
independent
look
and
the
touch
of
pride
in
their
dark
eyes
she
has
no
wraps
at
all
just
her
elegant
dress
her
bare
head
from
which
the
wisps
of
hair
blow
across
her
brow
and
the
transparent
nigger
silk
stockings
yet
she
does
not
seem
cold
she
talks
with
great
animation
sitting
between
the
two
young
men
and
she
holds
the
hand
of
the
one
in
the
overcoat
affectionately
she
is
always
holding
the
hand
of
one
or
other
of
the
two
young
men
and
wiping
wisps
of
hair
from
her
brow
and
talking
in
her
strong
nonchalant
voice
rapidly
ceaselessly
with
massive
energy
heaven
knows
if
the
two
young
men
they
are
passengers
were
previous
acquaintances
but
they
hold
her
hand
like
brothers
quite
simply
and
nicely
not
at
all
sticky
and
libidinous
it
all
has
an
air
of
why
not
she
shouts
at
me
as
i
pass
in
her
powerful
extraordinary
french
madame
votre
femme
elle
est
au
lit
i
say
she
is
lying
down
ah
she
nods
elle
a
le
mal
de
mer
no
she
is
not
just
lying
down
the
two
young
men
between
whom
she
is
sitting
as
between
two
pillows
watch
with
the
curious
sardinian
dark
eyes
that
seem
alert
and
show
the
white
all
round
they
are
pleasant
a
bit
like
seals
and
they
have
a
numb
look
for
the
moment
impressed
by
this
strange
language
she
proceeds
energetically
to
translate
into
sardinian
as
i
pass
on
we
do
not
seem
to
be
going
to
trapani
there
lies
the
town
on
the
left
under
the
hill
the
square
buildings
that
suggest
to
me
the
factories
of
the
east
india
company
shining
in
the
sun
along
the
curious
harbour
beyond
the
running
dark
blue
sea
we
seem
to
be
making
for
the
island
bulk
of
levanzo
perhaps
we
shall
steer
away
to
sardinia
without
putting
in
to
trapani
on
and
on
we
run
and
always
as
if
we
were
going
to
steer
between
the
pale
blue
islands
leaving
trapani
behind
us
on
our
left
the
town
has
been
in
sight
for
an
hour
or
more
and
still
we
run
out
to
sea
towards
levanzo
and
the
busily
and
throbs
in
his
little
cabin
on
this
upper
deck
peeping
in
one
sees
his
bed
and
chair
behind
a
curtain
screened
off
from
his
little
office
and
all
so
tidy
and
from
the
islands
one
of
the
mediterranean
sailing
ships
is
beating
her
way
across
our
track
to
trapani
i
do
know
the
name
of
ships
but
the
carpenter
says
she
is
a
schooner
he
says
it
with
that
italian
misgiving
which
does
really
know
but
which
ca
bear
not
to
know
anyhow
on
she
comes
with
her
tall
ladder
of
square
sails
white
in
the
afternoon
light
and
her
lovely
prow
curved
in
with
a
perfect
hollow
running
like
a
wild
animal
on
a
scent
across
the
waters
there
the
scent
leads
her
north
again
she
changes
her
tack
from
the
harbour
mouth
and
goes
coursing
away
passing
behind
us
lovely
she
is
nimble
and
quick
and
palpitating
with
all
her
sails
white
and
bright
and
eager
we
are
changing
our
course
we
have
all
the
time
been
heading
for
the
south
of
levanzo
now
i
see
the
island
slowly
edging
back
as
if
clearing
out
of
the
way
for
us
like
a
man
in
the
street
the
island
edges
and
turns
aside
and
walks
away
and
clearly
we
are
making
for
the
harbour
mouth
we
have
all
this
time
been
running
out
at
sea
round
the
back
of
the
harbour
now
i
see
the
an
old
thing
out
forward
to
sea
and
a
little
lighthouse
and
the
way
in
and
beyond
the
with
great
palm
trees
and
other
curious
dark
trees
and
behind
these
the
large
square
buildings
of
the
south
rising
imposingly
as
if
severe
big
palaces
upon
the
promenade
it
all
has
a
stately
southern
imposing
appearance
withal
remote
from
our
modern
centuries
standing
back
from
the
tides
of
our
industrial
life
i
remember
the
crusaders
how
they
called
here
so
often
on
their
way
to
the
east
and
trapani
seems
waiting
for
them
still
with
its
palm
trees
and
its
silence
full
in
the
afternoon
sun
it
has
not
much
to
do
but
wait
apparently
the
emerges
into
the
sun
crying
out
how
lovely
and
the
sea
is
quieter
we
are
already
in
the
lea
of
the
from
the
north
the
ship
from
the
islands
is
running
down
towards
us
with
the
wind
and
away
on
the
south
on
the
numerous
short
windmills
are
turning
their
sails
briskly
windmill
after
windmill
rather
stumpy
spinning
gaily
in
the
blue
silent
afternoon
among
the
stretching
away
towards
marsala
but
there
is
a
whole
legion
of
windmills
and
don
quixote
would
have
gone
off
his
head
there
they
spin
hither
and
thither
upon
the
and
perhaps
one
catches
a
glitter
of
white
for
these
are
the
great
which
make
trapani
rich
we
are
entering
the
however
past
the
old
castle
out
on
the
spit
past
the
little
lighthouse
then
through
the
entrance
slipping
quietly
on
the
now
tranquil
water
oh
and
how
pleasant
the
fulness
of
the
afternoon
sun
flooding
this
round
harbour
along
whose
side
the
tall
palms
drowse
and
whose
waters
are
fast
asleep
it
seems
quite
a
small
cosy
harbour
with
the
great
buildings
in
the
sun
behind
the
dark
of
the
marina
the
same
silent
sleeping
endlessly
stateliness
in
the
midst
of
this
tranquillity
we
slowly
turn
round
upon
the
shining
water
and
in
a
few
moments
are
moored
there
are
other
ships
moored
away
to
the
right
all
asleep
apparently
in
the
flooding
of
the
afternoon
sun
beyond
the
harbour
entrance
runs
the
great
sea
and
the
wind
here
all
is
still
and
hot
and
forgotten
vous
descendez
en
terre
shouts
the
young
woman
in
her
energetic
french
she
leaves
off
holding
the
young
men
hands
for
the
moment
we
are
not
quite
sure
and
we
do
want
her
to
come
with
us
anyhow
for
her
french
is
not
our
french
the
land
sleeps
on
nobody
takes
any
notice
of
us
but
just
one
boat
paddles
out
the
dozen
yards
to
our
side
we
decide
to
set
foot
on
shore
one
should
not
and
we
knew
it
one
should
never
enter
into
these
southern
towns
that
look
so
nice
so
lovely
from
the
outside
however
we
thought
we
would
buy
some
cakes
so
we
crossed
the
avenue
which
looks
so
beautiful
from
the
sea
and
which
when
you
get
into
it
is
a
cross
between
an
outside
place
where
you
throw
rubbish
and
a
humpy
unmade
road
in
a
raw
suburb
with
a
few
iron
seats
and
litter
of
old
straw
and
rag
indescribably
dreary
in
itself
yet
with
noble
trees
and
lovely
sunshine
and
the
sea
and
the
islands
gleaming
magic
beyond
the
harbour
mouth
and
the
sun
the
eternal
sun
full
focussed
a
few
mangy
people
stand
disconsolately
about
in
southern
fashion
as
if
they
had
been
left
there
by
the
last
flood
and
were
waiting
for
the
next
flood
to
wash
them
further
round
the
corner
along
the
quay
a
norwegian
steamer
dreams
that
she
is
being
loaded
in
the
muddle
of
the
small
port
we
looked
at
the
cakes
heavy
and
wan
they
appeared
to
our
stomachs
so
we
strolled
into
a
main
street
dark
and
dank
like
a
sewer
a
tram
bumped
to
a
standstill
as
if
now
at
last
was
the
end
of
the
world
children
coming
from
school
ecstatically
ran
at
our
heels
with
bated
breath
to
hear
the
vocal
horrors
of
our
foreign
speech
we
turned
down
a
dark
side
alley
about
forty
paces
deep
and
were
on
the
northern
bay
and
on
a
black
stench
that
seemed
like
the
perpetual
sewer
a
bank
of
mud
so
we
got
to
the
end
of
the
black
main
street
and
turned
in
haste
to
the
sun
ah
in
a
moment
we
were
in
it
there
rose
the
palms
there
lay
our
ship
in
the
shining
curving
basin
and
there
focussed
the
sun
so
that
in
a
moment
we
were
drunk
or
dazed
by
it
dazed
we
sat
on
an
iron
seat
in
the
avenue
a
ragged
and
dirty
girl
was
nursing
a
fat
and
moist
and
immovable
baby
and
tending
to
a
grimy
fat
infant
boy
she
stood
a
yard
away
and
gazed
at
us
as
one
would
gaze
at
a
pig
one
was
going
to
buy
she
came
nearer
and
examined
the
i
had
my
big
hat
down
over
my
eyes
but
no
she
had
taken
her
seat
at
my
side
and
poked
her
face
right
under
my
hat
brim
so
that
her
towzled
hair
touched
me
and
i
thought
she
would
kiss
me
but
again
no
with
her
breath
on
my
cheek
she
only
gazed
on
my
face
as
if
it
were
a
wax
mystery
i
got
up
hastily
too
much
for
me
said
i
to
the
she
laughed
and
asked
what
the
baby
was
called
the
baby
was
called
beppina
as
most
babies
are
driven
forth
we
wandered
down
the
desolate
avenue
of
shade
and
sun
towards
the
ship
and
turned
once
more
into
the
town
we
had
not
been
on
shore
more
than
ten
minutes
this
time
we
went
to
the
right
and
found
more
shops
the
streets
were
dark
and
sunless
and
cold
and
trapani
seemed
to
me
to
sell
only
two
commodities
cured
rabbit
skins
and
and
great
hideous
modern
arrangements
of
heavy
flowered
silk
and
fabulous
price
they
seem
to
think
nothing
of
thousands
of
liras
in
trapani
but
most
remarkable
was
bunny
and
pussy
bunny
and
pussy
flattened
out
like
pressed
leaves
dangling
in
clusters
everywhere
furs
white
bunny
black
bunny
in
great
abundance
piebald
bunny
grey
bunny
then
pussy
tabby
pussy
and
tortoiseshell
pussy
but
mostly
black
pussy
in
a
ghastly
semblance
of
life
all
flat
of
course
just
single
furs
clusters
bunches
heaps
and
dangling
arrays
of
puss
and
puss
and
bun
by
the
dozen
and
the
twenty
like
dried
leaves
for
your
choice
if
a
cat
from
a
ship
should
chance
to
find
itself
in
trapani
streets
it
would
give
a
mortal
yell
and
go
mad
i
am
sure
we
strolled
for
ten
more
minutes
in
this
narrow
tortuous
unreal
town
that
seemed
to
have
plenty
of
flourishing
inhabitants
and
a
fair
number
of
socialists
if
one
was
to
judge
by
the
great
scrawlings
on
the
walls
lenin
and
abasso
la
borghesia
do
imagine
by
the
way
that
lenin
is
another
wille
on
the
list
the
apparent
initial
stands
for
the
double
cakes
one
dared
not
buy
after
looking
at
them
but
we
found
macaroon
biscuits
and
a
sort
of
flat
of
the
infant
jesus
under
a
dove
of
which
we
bought
two
the
ate
her
macaroon
biscuits
all
through
the
streets
and
we
went
towards
the
ship
the
fat
boatman
hailed
us
to
take
us
back
it
was
just
about
eight
yards
of
water
to
row
the
ship
being
moored
on
the
quay
one
could
have
jumped
it
i
gave
the
fat
boatman
two
liras
two
francs
he
immediately
put
on
the
indignation
and
thrust
the
note
back
at
me
sixty
centimes
more
the
fee
was
thirteen
sous
each
way
in
venice
or
syracuse
it
would
be
two
sous
i
looked
at
him
and
gave
him
the
money
and
said
per
dio
we
are
in
trapani
he
muttered
back
something
about
foreigners
but
the
hateful
unmanly
insolence
of
these
lords
of
toil
now
they
have
their
various
unions
behind
them
and
their
rights
as
working
men
sends
my
blood
black
they
are
ordinary
men
no
more
the
human
happy
italian
is
most
marvellously
vanished
new
honors
come
upon
them
etc
the
dignity
of
human
labour
is
on
its
hind
legs
busy
giving
every
poor
innocent
who
is
ready
for
it
a
kick
in
the
mouth
but
once
more
in
parenthesis
let
me
remind
myself
that
it
is
our
own
english
fault
we
have
slobbered
about
the
nobility
of
toil
till
at
last
the
nobles
naturally
insist
on
eating
the
cake
and
more
than
that
we
have
set
forth
politically
on
such
a
high
and
galahad
quest
of
holy
liberty
and
been
caught
so
shamelessly
filling
our
pockets
that
no
wonder
the
naïve
and
idealistic
south
turns
us
down
with
a
bang
well
we
are
back
on
the
ship
and
we
want
tea
on
the
list
by
the
door
it
says
we
are
to
have
coffee
milk
and
butter
at
luncheon
at
tea
coffee
or
chocolate
at
and
dinner
at
and
moreover
the
company
will
feed
the
passengers
for
the
normal
duration
of
the
voyage
only
very
well
very
well
then
where
is
tea
not
any
signs
and
the
alpaca
jackets
giving
us
a
wide
berth
but
we
find
our
man
and
demand
our
rights
at
least
the
does
the
tickets
from
palermo
to
cagliari
cost
together
liras
of
this
liras
was
for
the
ticket
and
liras
each
for
the
food
this
for
two
tickets
would
make
liras
the
odd
three
for
usual
stamps
the
voyage
was
supposed
to
last
about
thirty
or
hours
from
eight
of
the
morning
of
departure
to
two
or
four
of
the
following
afternoon
surely
we
pay
for
our
tea
the
other
passengers
have
emerged
a
large
pale
fat
handsome
palermitan
who
is
going
to
be
professor
at
cagliari
his
large
fat
but
wife
and
three
children
a
boy
of
fourteen
like
a
thin
frail
fatherly
girl
a
little
boy
in
a
overcoat
coming
rather
unfluffed
and
a
on
the
mother
knee
the
being
of
course
the
only
man
in
the
party
they
have
all
been
sick
all
day
and
look
washed
out
we
sympathise
they
lament
the
cruelties
of
the
journey
and
servizio
senza
servizio
without
any
maid
servant
the
mother
asks
for
coffee
and
a
cup
of
milk
for
the
children
then
seeing
our
tea
with
lemon
and
knowing
it
by
repute
she
will
have
tea
but
the
will
have
coffee
coffee
and
milk
and
nothing
else
and
an
orange
and
the
baby
will
have
lemon
pieces
of
lemon
and
the
fatherly
young
miss
of
an
adolescent
brother
laughs
indulgently
at
all
the
whims
of
these
two
young
ones
the
father
laughs
and
thinks
it
all
adorable
and
expects
us
to
adore
he
is
almost
too
to
attend
properly
to
give
the
full
body
of
his
attention
so
the
mother
gets
her
cup
of
tea
and
puts
a
piece
of
lemon
in
and
then
milk
on
top
of
that
the
rabbit
boy
sucks
an
orange
slobbers
in
the
tea
insists
on
coffee
and
milk
tries
a
piece
of
lemon
and
gets
a
biscuit
the
baby
with
weird
faces
chews
pieces
of
lemon
and
drops
them
in
the
family
cup
and
fishes
them
out
with
a
little
sugar
and
dribbles
them
across
the
table
to
her
mouth
throws
them
away
and
reaches
for
a
new
sour
piece
they
all
think
it
humorous
and
adorable
arrives
the
milk
to
be
treated
as
another
loving
cup
mingled
with
orange
lemon
sugar
tea
biscuit
chocolate
and
cake
father
mother
and
elder
brother
partake
of
nothing
they
have
the
stomach
but
they
are
charmed
of
course
by
the
pretty
pranks
and
messes
of
the
infants
they
have
extraordinary
amiable
patience
and
find
the
young
ones
a
perpetual
source
of
charming
amusement
they
look
at
one
another
the
elder
ones
and
laugh
and
comment
while
the
two
young
ones
mix
themselves
and
the
table
into
a
mess
this
inordinate
italian
amiable
patience
with
their
young
monkeys
is
astonishing
it
makes
the
monkeys
more
and
incredibly
so
that
a
baby
has
all
the
tricks
of
a
babylonian
harlot
making
eyes
and
trying
new
pranks
till
at
last
one
sees
the
southern
holy
family
as
an
unholy
triad
of
imbecility
meanwhile
i
munched
my
arrangement
which
was
rather
like
eating
thin
glass
so
hard
and
sharp
it
was
made
of
almond
and
white
of
egg
presumably
and
was
not
so
bad
if
you
could
eat
it
at
all
it
was
a
christmas
and
i
watched
the
holy
family
across
the
narrow
board
and
tried
not
to
look
all
i
felt
going
on
deck
as
soon
as
possible
we
watched
the
loading
of
barrels
of
wine
into
the
hold
a
mild
and
process
the
ship
seemed
to
be
almost
as
empty
of
cargo
as
of
passengers
of
the
latter
we
were
apparently
twelve
adults
all
told
and
the
three
children
and
as
for
cargo
there
were
the
wooden
chests
of
the
officer
and
these
fourteen
barrels
of
wine
from
trapani
the
last
were
at
length
settled
more
or
less
firm
the
owner
or
the
responsible
landsman
seeing
to
it
no
one
on
the
ship
seemed
to
be
responsible
for
anything
and
four
of
the
innumerable
crew
were
replacing
the
big
planks
over
the
hold
it
was
curious
how
forlorn
the
ship
seemed
to
feel
now
she
was
ready
for
sea
again
her
innumerable
crew
did
not
succeed
in
making
her
alive
she
ran
her
course
like
a
lost
soul
across
the
outside
the
harbour
the
sun
was
sinking
gorgeous
gold
and
red
the
sky
and
vast
beyond
the
darkening
islands
of
the
egades
group
coming
as
we
did
from
the
east
side
of
the
island
where
dawn
beyond
the
ionian
sea
is
the
day
great
and
familiar
event
so
decisive
an
event
that
as
the
light
appears
along
the
sea
rim
so
do
my
eyes
invariably
open
and
look
at
it
and
know
it
is
dawn
and
as
the
is
fused
back
and
a
little
scarlet
thrills
towards
the
zenith
invariably
day
by
day
i
feel
i
must
get
up
coming
from
the
east
shut
off
hermetically
from
the
west
by
the
steep
spikes
of
the
mountains
at
our
back
we
felt
this
sunset
in
the
african
sea
terrible
and
dramatic
it
seemed
much
more
magnificent
and
tragic
than
our
ionian
dawn
which
has
always
a
suggestion
of
a
flower
opening
but
this
great
red
sunset
had
something
african
upon
the
sea
and
it
seemed
so
far
off
in
an
unknown
land
whereas
our
ionian
dawn
always
seems
near
and
familiar
and
happy
a
different
goddess
the
eryx
astarte
the
woman
ashtaroth
must
have
been
in
her
prehstoric
dark
smiling
watching
the
fearful
sunsets
beyond
the
egades
from
our
apollo
of
the
ionian
east
she
is
a
strange
goddess
to
me
this
erycina
venus
and
the
west
is
strange
and
unfamiliar
and
a
little
fearful
be
it
africa
or
be
it
america
slowly
at
sunset
we
moved
out
of
the
harbour
and
almost
as
we
passed
the
bar
away
in
front
we
saw
among
the
islands
the
pricking
of
a
quick
pointed
light
looking
back
we
saw
the
light
at
the
harbour
entrance
twitching
and
the
remote
lost
town
beginning
to
glimmer
and
night
was
settling
down
upon
the
sea
through
the
crimsoned
purple
of
the
last
afterglow
the
islands
loomed
big
as
we
drew
nearer
dark
in
the
thickening
darkness
overhead
a
magnificent
blazed
above
the
open
sea
giving
me
a
pang
at
the
heart
for
i
was
so
used
to
see
her
hang
just
above
the
spikes
of
the
mountains
that
i
felt
she
might
fall
having
the
space
beneath
levanzo
and
the
other
large
island
were
quite
dark
absolutely
dark
save
for
one
beam
of
a
lighthouse
low
down
in
the
distance
the
wind
was
again
strong
and
cold
the
ship
had
commenced
her
old
slither
and
heave
slither
and
heave
which
mercifully
we
had
forgotten
overhead
were
innumerable
great
stars
active
as
if
they
were
alive
in
the
sky
i
saw
orion
high
behind
us
and
the
glaring
and
went
the
sea
as
we
took
the
waves
then
after
a
long
trough
this
curious
rhythmic
swishing
and
hollow
drumming
of
a
steamer
at
sea
has
a
narcotic
almost
maddening
effect
on
the
spirit
a
long
hissing
burst
of
waters
then
the
hollow
roll
and
again
the
upheaval
to
a
sudden
a
bell
had
clanged
and
we
knew
the
crew
were
once
more
feeding
at
every
moment
of
the
day
and
presumably
of
the
night
feeding
was
going
on
or
we
were
summoned
to
dinner
our
young
woman
was
already
seated
and
a
fat
uniformed
mate
or
purser
or
official
of
some
sort
was
finishing
off
in
the
distance
the
pale
professor
also
appeared
and
at
a
certain
distance
down
the
table
sat
a
little
grey
man
in
a
long
grey
alpaca
travelling
coat
appeared
the
beloved
macaroni
with
tomato
sauce
no
food
for
the
sea
i
put
my
hopes
on
the
fish
had
i
not
seen
the
cook
making
whiting
bite
their
own
tails
viciously
the
fish
appeared
and
what
was
it
fried
a
is
an
also
it
is
a
polyp
a
little
octopus
which
alas
frequents
the
mediterranean
and
squirts
ink
if
offended
this
polyp
with
its
tentacles
is
cut
up
and
fried
and
reduced
to
the
consistency
of
boiled
celluloid
it
is
esteemed
a
delicacy
but
is
tougher
than
indiarubber
gristly
through
and
through
i
have
a
peculiar
aversion
to
these
once
in
liguria
we
had
a
boat
of
our
own
and
paddled
with
the
peasant
paddlers
alessandro
caught
and
like
this
he
tied
up
a
female
by
a
string
in
a
cave
the
string
going
through
a
convenient
hole
in
her
end
there
she
lived
like
an
amphitrite
terrier
tied
up
till
alessandro
went
then
he
towed
her
like
a
poodle
behind
and
thus
like
a
she
attracted
in
the
briny
seas
and
these
poor
polyp
inamorati
were
the
victims
they
were
lifted
as
prey
on
board
where
i
looked
with
horror
on
their
grey
translucent
tentacles
and
large
cold
stony
eyes
the
was
towed
behind
again
but
after
a
few
days
she
died
and
i
think
even
for
creatures
so
this
method
is
indescribably
base
and
shows
how
much
lower
than
an
octopus
even
is
lordly
man
well
we
chewed
a
few
ends
of
and
gave
it
up
the
cagliari
girl
gave
up
too
the
professor
had
not
even
tried
only
the
grey
man
in
the
alpaca
coat
chewed
animatedly
with
bouncing
jaws
mountains
of
calamaio
remained
for
the
joyous
arrived
the
inevitable
meat
this
long
piece
of
completely
tasteless
undercut
in
innumerable
slices
oh
italy
the
professor
fled
arrived
the
pears
the
apples
the
oranges
we
saved
an
apple
for
a
happier
hour
arrived
coffee
and
as
a
magnificent
treat
a
few
pastries
they
all
taste
wearily
alike
the
young
woman
shakes
her
head
i
shake
mine
but
the
like
a
child
is
pleased
most
pleased
of
all
however
are
the
who
dart
in
a
bunch
to
the
tin
altar
and
there
loudly
buzz
wildly
above
the
sallow
cakes
the
dry
one
however
cares
darkly
nothing
for
cakes
he
comes
once
more
to
twit
us
about
wine
so
much
so
that
the
cagliari
girl
orders
a
glass
of
marsala
and
i
must
second
her
so
there
we
are
three
little
glasses
of
brown
liquid
the
cagliari
girl
sips
hers
and
suddenly
flees
the
sips
hers
with
infinite
caution
and
quietly
retires
i
finish
the
little
glass
and
my
own
and
the
voracious
buzz
derisively
and
excited
the
one
has
disappeared
with
the
bottle
from
the
professorial
cabin
faint
wails
sometimes
almost
fierce
as
one
or
another
is
going
to
be
only
a
thin
door
is
between
this
and
them
the
most
frayed
ancient
rag
of
a
man
goes
discreetly
with
basins
trying
not
to
let
out
glimpses
of
the
awful
within
i
climb
up
to
look
at
the
vivid
drenching
stars
to
breathe
the
cold
wind
to
see
the
dark
sea
sliding
then
i
too
go
to
the
cabin
and
watch
the
sea
run
past
the
porthole
for
a
minute
and
insert
myself
like
the
meat
in
a
sandwich
into
the
tight
lower
bunk
oh
infinitesimal
cabin
where
we
sway
like
two
matches
in
a
match
box
oh
strange
but
even
yet
excellent
gallop
of
a
ship
at
sea
i
slept
not
so
badly
through
the
stifled
rolling
night
in
fact
later
on
slept
soundly
and
the
day
was
growing
bright
when
i
peered
through
the
porthle
the
sea
was
much
smoother
it
was
a
brilliant
clear
morning
i
made
haste
and
washed
myself
cursorily
in
the
saucer
that
dribbled
into
a
pail
in
a
corner
there
was
not
space
even
for
one
chair
this
saucer
was
by
my
and
i
went
on
deck
ah
the
lovely
morning
away
behind
us
the
sun
was
just
coming
above
the
sea
horizon
and
the
sky
all
golden
all
a
joyous
gold
and
the
sea
was
glassy
bright
the
wind
gone
still
the
waves
sunk
into
long
low
undulations
the
foam
of
the
wake
was
pale
in
the
yellow
air
sweet
sweet
wide
morning
on
the
sea
with
the
sun
coming
swimming
up
and
a
tall
sailing
bark
with
her
flat
of
sails
delicately
across
the
light
and
a
steamer
on
the
electric
vivid
morning
horizon
the
lovely
dawn
the
lovely
pure
wide
morning
in
the
so
and
delighted
with
the
sea
like
sequins
shaking
and
the
sky
far
far
far
above
unfathomably
clear
how
glad
to
be
on
a
ship
what
a
golden
hour
for
the
heart
of
man
ah
if
one
could
sail
for
ever
on
a
small
quiet
lonely
ship
from
land
to
land
and
isle
to
isle
and
saunter
through
the
spaces
of
this
lovely
world
always
through
the
spaces
of
this
lovely
world
sweet
it
would
be
sometimes
to
come
to
the
opaque
earth
to
block
oneself
against
the
stiff
land
to
annul
the
vibration
of
one
flight
against
the
inertia
of
our
firma
but
life
itself
would
be
in
the
flight
the
tremble
of
space
ah
the
trembling
of
space
as
one
moves
in
flight
space
and
the
frail
vibration
of
space
the
glad
lonely
wringing
of
the
heart
not
to
be
clogged
to
the
land
any
more
not
to
be
any
more
like
a
donkey
with
a
log
on
its
leg
fastened
to
weary
earth
that
has
no
answer
now
but
to
be
off
to
find
three
masculine
souls
and
saunter
and
saunter
on
along
with
them
across
the
dithering
space
as
long
as
life
lasts
why
come
to
anchor
there
is
nothing
to
anchor
for
land
has
no
answer
to
the
soul
any
more
it
has
gone
inert
give
me
a
little
ship
kind
gods
and
three
comrades
hear
me
and
let
me
wander
aimless
across
this
vivid
outer
world
the
world
empty
of
man
where
space
flies
happily
the
lovely
morning
of
the
open
sea
paling
towards
a
rare
sweet
blue
the
sun
stood
above
the
horizon
like
the
great
burning
stigma
of
the
sacred
flower
of
day
mediterranean
so
mediaeval
hovered
on
the
faint
morning
wind
as
if
uncertain
which
way
to
go
curious
insects
of
the
flower
the
steamer
was
sinking
towards
spain
space
rang
clear
about
us
the
level
sea
appeared
the
cagliari
young
woman
and
her
two
friends
she
was
looking
handsome
and
restored
now
the
sea
was
easy
her
two
male
friends
stood
touching
her
one
at
either
shoulder
bonjour
monsieur
she
barked
across
at
me
vous
avez
pris
le
café
pas
encore
et
vous
non
madame
votre
femme
she
roared
like
a
mastiff
dog
and
then
translated
with
unction
to
her
two
uninitiated
friends
how
it
was
they
did
not
understand
her
french
i
do
not
know
it
was
so
like
travestied
italian
i
went
below
to
find
the
when
we
came
up
the
faint
shape
of
land
appeared
ahead
more
transparent
than
thin
pearl
already
sardinia
magic
are
high
lands
seen
from
the
sea
when
they
are
far
far
off
and
ghostly
translucent
like
this
was
sardinia
looming
like
fascinating
shadows
in
and
the
sailing
ships
as
if
cut
out
of
frailest
pearl
translucency
were
wafting
away
towards
naples
i
wanted
to
count
their
sails
five
square
ones
which
i
call
the
ladder
one
above
the
other
but
how
many
that
remained
yet
to
be
seen
our
friend
the
carpenter
spied
us
out
at
least
he
was
not
my
friend
he
did
find
me
i
am
sure
but
up
he
came
and
proceeded
to
entertain
us
with
weary
banality
again
the
young
woman
called
had
we
had
coffee
we
said
we
were
just
going
down
and
then
she
said
that
whatever
we
had
today
we
had
to
pay
for
our
food
ended
with
the
one
day
at
which
the
was
angry
feeling
swindled
but
i
had
known
before
we
went
down
and
had
our
coffee
notwithstanding
the
young
woman
came
down
and
made
eyes
at
one
of
the
alpaca
after
which
we
saw
a
cup
of
coffee
and
milk
and
two
biscuits
being
taken
to
her
into
her
cabin
discreetly
when
italians
are
being
discreet
and
on
the
sly
the
very
air
about
them
becomes
and
seems
to
shout
with
a
thousand
tongues
so
with
a
thousand
invisible
tongues
clamouring
the
fact
the
young
woman
had
her
coffee
secretly
and
in
her
cabin
but
the
morning
was
lovely
the
and
i
crept
round
the
bench
at
the
very
stern
of
the
ship
and
sat
out
of
the
wind
and
out
of
sight
just
above
the
foaming
of
the
wake
before
us
was
the
open
morning
and
the
glisten
of
our
ship
track
like
a
snail
path
trailing
across
the
sea
straight
for
a
little
while
then
giving
a
bend
to
the
left
always
a
bend
towards
the
left
and
coming
at
us
from
the
pure
horizon
like
a
bright
happy
it
was
to
sit
there
in
the
stillness
with
nothing
but
the
humanless
sea
to
shine
about
us
but
no
we
were
found
out
arrived
the
carpenter
ah
you
have
found
a
fine
place
molto
bello
this
from
the
i
could
not
bear
the
irruption
he
proceeded
to
talk
and
as
is
inevitable
the
war
ah
the
war
it
was
a
terrible
thing
he
had
become
ill
very
because
you
see
not
only
do
you
go
without
proper
food
without
proper
rest
and
warmth
but
you
see
you
are
in
an
agony
of
fear
for
your
life
all
the
time
an
agony
of
fear
for
your
life
and
that
what
does
it
six
months
in
hospital
the
of
course
was
sympathetic
the
sicilians
are
quite
simple
about
it
they
just
tell
you
they
were
frightened
to
death
and
it
made
them
ill
the
loves
them
for
being
so
simple
about
it
i
feel
angry
somewhere
for
they
a
sympathy
and
however
the
great
god
mars
may
have
shrunk
and
gone
wizened
in
the
world
it
still
annoys
me
to
hear
him
blasphemed
near
us
the
automatic
log
was
spinning
the
thin
rope
trailing
behind
us
in
the
sea
erratically
it
jerked
and
spun
with
spasmodic
torsion
he
explained
that
the
little
screw
at
the
end
of
the
line
spun
to
the
speed
of
travelling
we
were
going
from
ten
to
twelve
italian
miles
to
the
hour
ah
yes
we
go
twenty
but
we
went
no
faster
than
ten
or
twelve
to
save
the
coal
the
coal
il
carbone
i
knew
we
were
in
for
it
england
she
has
the
coal
and
what
does
she
do
she
sells
it
very
dear
particularly
to
italy
italy
won
the
war
and
now
ca
even
have
coal
because
why
the
price
the
exchange
now
i
am
doubly
in
for
it
two
countries
had
been
able
to
keep
their
money
high
england
and
america
the
english
sovereign
la
sterlina
and
the
american
dollar
these
were
money
the
english
and
the
americans
flocked
to
italy
with
their
and
their
and
they
bought
what
they
wanted
for
nothing
for
nothing
ecco
whereas
we
poor
italians
we
are
in
a
state
of
ruination
proper
ruination
the
allies
etc
i
am
so
used
to
it
i
am
so
wearily
used
to
it
i
ca
walk
a
stride
without
having
this
wretched
the
exchange
thrown
at
my
head
and
this
with
an
injured
petulant
spitefulness
which
turns
my
blood
for
i
assure
them
whatever
i
have
in
italy
i
pay
for
and
i
am
not
england
i
am
not
the
british
isles
on
two
legs
germany
la
germania
she
did
wrong
to
make
the
war
but
there
you
are
that
was
war
italy
and
germany
e
la
germania
they
had
always
been
friends
in
palermo
my
god
i
felt
i
could
not
stand
it
another
second
to
sit
above
the
foam
and
have
this
miserable
creature
stuffing
wads
of
chewed
newspaper
into
my
ear
no
i
could
not
bear
it
in
italy
there
is
no
escape
say
two
words
and
the
individual
starts
chewing
old
newspaper
and
stuffing
it
into
you
no
escape
you
become
if
you
are
english
and
and
as
england
coal
and
exchange
you
are
treated
it
is
more
than
useless
to
try
to
be
human
about
it
you
are
a
state
usury
system
a
coal
fiend
and
an
exchange
thief
every
englishman
has
disappeared
into
this
triple
abstraction
in
the
eyes
of
the
italian
of
the
proletariat
particularly
try
and
get
them
to
be
human
try
and
get
them
to
see
that
you
are
simply
an
individual
if
you
can
after
all
i
am
no
more
than
a
single
human
man
wandering
my
lonely
way
across
these
years
but
no
to
an
italian
i
am
a
perfected
abstraction
england
coal
exchange
the
germans
were
once
devils
for
inhuman
theoretic
abstracting
of
living
beings
but
now
the
italians
beat
them
i
am
a
walking
column
of
statistics
which
adds
up
badly
for
italy
only
this
and
nothing
more
which
being
so
i
shut
my
mouth
and
walk
away
for
the
moment
the
carpenter
is
shaken
off
but
i
am
in
a
rage
fool
that
i
am
it
is
like
being
pestered
by
their
mosquitoes
the
sailing
ships
are
near
and
i
count
fifteen
sails
beautiful
they
look
yet
if
i
were
on
board
somebody
would
be
chewing
newspaper
at
me
and
addressing
me
as
england
coal
exchange
the
mosquito
hovers
and
hovers
but
the
stony
blank
of
the
side
of
my
cheek
keeps
him
away
yet
he
hovers
and
the
feels
sympathetic
towards
him
quite
sympathetic
because
of
course
he
treats
her
a
as
if
he
would
lick
her
boots
or
anything
else
that
she
would
let
him
lick
meanwhile
we
eat
the
apples
from
yesterday
dessert
and
the
remains
of
the
cake
the
land
is
drawing
nearer
we
can
see
the
shape
of
the
end
promontory
and
peninsula
and
a
white
speck
like
a
church
the
bulk
of
the
land
is
forlorn
and
rather
shapeless
coming
towards
us
but
attractive
looking
ahead
towards
the
land
gives
us
away
the
mosquito
swoops
on
us
yes
he
is
not
sure
he
thinks
the
white
speck
is
a
church
or
a
lighthouse
when
you
pass
the
cape
on
the
right
and
enter
the
wide
bay
between
cape
spartivento
and
cape
carbonara
then
you
have
two
hours
sail
to
cagliari
we
shall
arrive
between
two
and
three
it
is
now
eleven
yes
the
sailing
ships
are
probably
going
to
naples
there
is
not
much
wind
for
them
now
when
there
is
wind
they
go
fast
faster
than
our
steamer
ah
naples
bella
bella
eh
a
little
dirty
say
i
but
what
do
you
want
says
he
a
great
city
palermo
of
course
is
better
ah
the
neapolitan
women
he
says
à
propos
or
not
they
do
their
hair
so
fine
so
neat
and
beautiful
but
underneath
sotto
sotto
they
are
dirty
this
being
received
in
cold
silence
he
continues
giriamo
il
mondo
noi
chi
giriamo
conosciamo
il
travel
about
and
know
the
world
who
are
i
do
not
know
his
highness
the
palermitan
carpenter
lout
no
doubt
but
who
travel
know
the
world
he
is
preparing
his
shot
the
neapolitan
women
and
the
english
women
in
this
are
equal
that
they
are
dirty
underneath
underneath
they
are
dirty
the
women
of
london
but
it
is
getting
too
much
for
me
you
who
look
for
dirty
women
say
i
find
dirty
women
everywhere
he
stops
short
and
watches
me
no
no
you
have
not
understood
me
no
i
do
mean
that
i
mean
that
the
neapolitan
women
and
the
english
women
have
dirty
underclothing
to
which
he
gets
no
answer
but
a
cold
look
and
a
cold
cheek
whereupon
he
turns
to
the
and
proceeds
to
be
and
after
a
few
moments
he
turns
again
to
me
il
signore
is
offended
he
is
offended
with
me
but
i
turn
the
other
way
and
at
last
he
clears
out
in
triumph
i
must
admit
like
a
mosquito
that
has
bitten
one
in
the
neck
as
a
matter
of
fact
one
should
let
these
fellows
get
into
conversation
nowadays
they
are
no
longer
human
beings
they
hate
one
englishness
and
leave
out
the
individual
we
walk
forward
towards
the
where
the
captain
lookout
cabin
is
the
captain
is
an
elderly
man
silent
and
crushed
with
the
look
of
a
gentleman
but
he
looks
beaten
down
another
still
another
member
of
the
department
is
just
creeping
up
his
ladder
with
a
cup
of
black
coffee
returning
we
peep
down
the
into
the
kitchen
and
there
we
see
roast
chicken
and
sausages
roast
chicken
and
sausages
ah
this
is
where
the
sides
of
kid
and
the
chickens
and
the
good
things
go
all
down
the
throats
of
the
crew
there
is
no
more
food
for
us
until
we
land
we
have
passed
the
cape
and
the
white
thing
is
a
lighthouse
and
the
fattish
handsome
professor
has
come
up
carrying
the
little
while
the
femalish
elder
brother
leads
the
small
boy
by
the
hand
so
so
terribly
they
deposit
themselves
near
us
and
it
threatens
another
conversation
but
not
for
anything
my
dears
the
sailors
not
sailors
some
of
the
loafers
are
hoisting
the
flag
the
italian
tricolor
it
floats
at
the
and
the
femalish
brother
in
a
fine
burst
of
feeling
takes
off
his
funny
hat
with
a
flourish
and
cries
ecco
la
bandiera
italiana
ach
the
hateful
sentimentalism
of
these
days
the
land
passes
slowly
very
slowly
it
is
hilly
but
barren
looking
with
few
trees
and
it
is
not
spikey
and
rather
splendid
like
sicily
sicily
has
style
we
keep
along
the
east
side
of
the
bay
away
in
the
west
is
cape
spartivento
and
still
no
sight
of
cagliari
two
hours
yet
cries
the
cagliari
girl
two
hours
before
we
eat
ah
when
i
get
on
land
what
a
good
meal
i
shall
eat
the
men
haul
in
the
automatic
log
the
sky
is
clouding
over
with
that
icy
curd
which
comes
after
midday
when
the
bitter
north
wind
is
blowing
it
is
no
longer
warm
slowly
slowly
we
creep
along
the
formless
shore
an
hour
passes
we
see
a
little
fort
ahead
done
in
enormous
checks
like
a
fragment
of
gigantic
it
stands
at
the
end
of
a
long
spit
of
land
a
long
barish
peninsula
that
has
no
houses
and
looks
as
if
it
might
be
but
it
is
not
and
suddenly
there
is
cagliari
a
naked
town
rising
steep
steep
piled
naked
to
the
sky
from
the
plain
at
the
head
of
the
formless
hollow
bay
it
is
strange
and
rather
wonderful
not
a
bit
like
italy
the
city
piles
up
lofty
and
almost
miniature
and
makes
me
think
of
jerusalem
without
trees
without
cover
rising
rather
bare
and
proud
remote
as
if
back
in
history
like
a
town
in
a
monkish
illuminated
missal
one
wonders
how
it
ever
got
there
and
it
seems
like
spain
or
malta
not
italy
it
is
a
steep
and
lonely
city
treeless
as
in
some
old
illumination
yet
withal
rather
like
a
sudden
amber
jewel
naked
at
the
depth
of
the
vast
indenture
the
air
is
cold
blowing
bleak
and
bitter
the
sky
is
all
curd
and
that
is
cagliari
it
has
that
curious
look
as
if
it
could
be
seen
but
not
entered
it
is
like
some
vision
some
memory
something
that
has
passed
away
impossible
that
one
can
actually
in
that
city
set
foot
there
and
eat
and
laugh
there
ah
no
yet
the
ship
drifts
nearer
nearer
and
we
are
looking
for
the
actual
harbour
the
usual
with
dark
trees
for
a
promenade
and
palatial
buildings
behind
but
here
not
so
pink
and
gay
more
reticent
more
sombre
of
yellow
stone
the
harbour
itself
a
little
basin
of
water
into
which
we
are
slipping
carefully
while
three
laden
with
salt
as
white
as
snow
creep
round
from
the
left
drawn
by
an
infinitesimal
tug
there
are
only
two
other
forlorn
ships
in
the
basin
it
is
cold
on
deck
the
ship
turns
slowly
round
and
is
being
hauled
to
the
quay
side
i
go
down
for
the
knapsack
and
a
fat
pounces
at
me
you
pay
nine
francs
fifty
i
pay
them
and
we
get
off
that
ship
iii
cagliari
there
is
a
very
little
crowd
waiting
on
the
quay
mostly
men
with
their
hands
in
their
pockets
but
thank
heaven
they
have
a
certain
aloofness
and
reserve
they
are
not
like
the
of
these
days
who
move
to
the
attack
with
a
terrifying
cold
vindictiveness
the
moment
one
emerges
from
any
vehicle
and
some
of
these
men
look
really
poor
there
are
no
poor
italians
any
more
at
least
loafers
strange
the
feeling
round
the
harbour
as
if
everybody
had
gone
away
yet
there
are
people
about
it
is
festa
however
epiphany
but
it
is
so
different
from
sicily
none
of
the
suave
charms
none
of
the
airs
and
graces
none
of
the
glamour
rather
bare
rather
stark
rather
cold
and
yellow
somehow
like
malta
without
malta
foreign
liveliness
thank
goodness
no
one
wants
to
carry
my
knapsack
thank
goodness
no
one
has
a
fit
at
the
sight
of
it
thank
heaven
no
one
takes
any
notice
they
stand
cold
and
aloof
and
do
move
we
make
our
way
through
the
customs
then
through
the
dazio
the
city
then
we
are
free
we
set
off
up
a
steep
new
broad
road
with
little
trees
on
either
side
but
stone
arid
new
wide
stone
yellowish
under
the
cold
sky
and
though
of
course
there
are
people
about
the
north
wind
blows
bitingly
we
climb
a
broad
flight
of
steps
always
upwards
up
the
wide
precipitous
dreary
boulevard
with
sprouts
of
trees
looking
for
the
hotel
and
dying
with
hunger
at
last
we
find
it
the
scala
di
ferro
through
a
courtyard
with
green
plants
and
at
last
a
little
man
with
lank
black
hair
like
an
esquimo
comes
smiling
he
is
one
brand
of
sardinian
esquimo
looking
there
is
no
room
with
two
beds
only
single
rooms
and
thus
we
are
led
off
if
you
please
to
the
bagnio
the
wing
on
the
dank
ground
floor
cubicles
on
either
side
a
stone
passage
and
in
every
cubicle
a
dark
stone
bath
and
a
little
bed
we
can
have
each
a
little
bath
cubicle
if
there
nothing
else
for
it
there
is
but
it
seems
dank
and
cold
and
horrid
underground
and
one
thinks
of
all
the
unsavory
assignations
at
these
old
bagnio
places
true
at
the
end
of
the
passage
are
seated
two
carabinieri
but
whether
to
ensure
respectibility
or
not
heaven
knows
we
are
in
the
baths
that
all
illustration
isili
the
esquimo
returns
after
five
minutes
however
there
a
bedroom
in
the
house
he
is
pleased
because
he
did
like
putting
us
into
the
bagnio
where
he
found
the
bedroom
i
do
know
but
there
it
was
large
sombre
cold
and
over
the
kitchen
fumes
of
a
small
inner
court
like
a
well
but
perfectly
clean
and
all
right
and
the
people
seemed
warm
and
like
human
beings
one
has
got
so
used
to
the
sicilians
who
are
suave
and
so
completely
callous
after
a
really
good
meal
we
went
out
to
see
the
town
it
was
after
three
and
everywhere
was
shut
up
like
an
english
sunday
cold
stony
cagliari
in
summer
you
must
be
sizzling
hot
cagliari
like
a
kiln
the
men
stood
about
in
groups
but
without
the
intimate
italian
watchfulness
that
never
leaves
a
alone
strange
stony
cagliari
we
climbed
up
a
street
like
a
corkscrew
stairway
and
we
saw
announcements
of
a
children
ball
cagliari
is
very
steep
up
there
is
a
strange
place
called
the
bastions
a
large
level
space
like
a
with
trees
curiously
suspended
over
the
town
and
sending
off
a
long
shoot
like
a
wide
viaduct
across
above
the
corkscrew
street
that
comes
climbing
up
above
this
bastion
place
the
town
still
rises
steeply
to
the
cathedral
and
the
fort
what
is
so
curious
is
that
this
terrace
or
bastion
is
so
large
like
some
big
recreation
ground
that
it
is
almost
dreary
and
one
can
not
understand
its
being
suspended
in
down
below
is
the
little
circle
of
the
harbour
to
the
left
a
low
sea
plain
with
tufts
of
palm
trees
and
houses
from
this
runs
out
the
long
spit
of
land
towards
that
the
white
road
trailing
forth
on
the
right
most
curiously
a
long
strange
spit
of
sand
runs
in
a
causeway
far
across
the
shallows
of
the
bay
with
the
open
sea
on
one
hand
and
vast
lagoons
on
the
other
there
are
peaky
dark
mountains
beyond
this
just
as
across
the
vast
bay
are
gloomy
hills
it
is
a
strange
strange
landscape
as
if
here
the
world
left
off
the
bay
is
vast
in
itself
and
all
these
curious
things
happening
at
its
head
this
curious
town
like
a
great
stud
of
rock
jutting
up
out
of
the
bay
flats
around
it
on
one
side
the
weary
malarial
plain
and
on
the
other
side
great
salt
lagoons
dead
beyond
the
these
backed
again
by
serried
clustered
mountains
suddenly
while
away
beyond
the
plain
hills
rise
to
sea
again
land
and
sea
both
seem
to
give
out
exhausted
at
the
bay
head
the
world
end
and
into
this
world
end
starts
up
cagliari
and
on
either
side
sudden
hills
but
it
still
reminds
me
of
malta
lost
between
europe
and
africa
and
belonging
to
nowhere
belonging
to
nowhere
never
having
belonged
to
anywhere
to
spain
and
the
arabs
and
the
phoenicians
most
but
as
if
it
had
never
really
had
a
fate
no
fate
left
outside
of
time
and
history
the
spirit
of
the
place
is
a
strange
thing
our
mechanical
age
tries
to
override
it
but
it
does
not
succeed
in
the
end
the
strange
sinister
spirit
of
the
place
so
diverse
and
adverse
in
differing
places
will
smash
our
mechanical
oneness
into
smithereens
and
all
that
we
think
the
real
thing
will
go
off
with
a
pop
and
we
shall
be
left
staring
on
the
great
parapet
above
the
municipal
hall
and
above
the
corkscrew
a
thick
fringe
of
people
is
hanging
looking
down
we
go
to
look
too
and
behold
below
there
is
the
entrance
to
the
ball
yes
there
is
a
china
shepherdess
in
pale
blue
and
powdered
hair
crook
ribbons
marie
antoinette
satin
daintiness
and
all
slowly
and
haughtily
walking
up
the
road
and
gazing
superbly
round
she
is
not
more
than
twelve
years
old
moreover
two
servants
accompany
her
she
gazes
supremely
from
right
to
left
as
she
goes
mincingly
and
i
would
give
her
the
prize
for
haughtiness
she
is
perfect
a
little
too
haughty
for
watteau
but
marquise
to
a
the
people
watch
in
silence
there
is
no
yelling
and
screaming
and
running
they
watch
in
a
suitable
silence
comes
a
carriage
with
two
fat
bay
horses
slithering
almost
swimming
up
the
corkscrew
that
in
itself
is
a
for
cagliari
does
have
carriages
imagine
a
street
like
a
corkscrew
stair
paved
with
slippery
stone
and
imagine
two
bay
horses
rowing
their
way
up
it
they
did
not
walk
a
single
stride
but
they
arrived
and
there
fluttered
out
three
strangely
exquisite
children
two
frail
white
satin
pierrots
and
a
white
satin
pierrette
they
were
like
fragile
winter
butterflies
with
black
spots
they
had
a
curious
indefinable
remote
elegance
something
conventional
and
but
not
our
century
the
wonderful
artificial
delicacy
of
the
eighteenth
the
boys
had
big
perfect
ruffs
round
their
necks
and
behind
were
slung
old
spanish
shawls
for
warmth
they
were
frail
as
tobacco
flowers
and
with
remote
cold
elegance
they
fluttered
by
the
carriage
from
which
emerged
a
large
mama
fluttering
their
queer
little
butterfly
feet
on
the
pavement
hovering
round
the
large
mama
like
three
ghosts
they
found
their
way
past
the
solid
seated
carabinieri
into
the
hall
arrived
a
beau
with
ruffles
and
his
hat
under
his
arm
about
twelve
years
old
walking
statelily
without
a
qualm
up
the
steep
twist
of
the
street
or
perhaps
so
perfect
in
his
that
it
became
an
elegant
aplomb
in
him
he
was
a
genuine
exquisite
rather
stiffer
than
the
french
maybe
but
completely
in
the
spirit
curious
curious
children
they
had
a
certain
superbness
and
not
a
single
trace
of
misgiving
for
them
their
noblesse
was
indisputable
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
recognized
the
true
cold
superbness
of
the
old
noblesse
they
had
not
a
single
qualm
about
their
own
perfect
representing
of
the
higher
order
of
being
followed
another
white
satin
marquise
with
a
they
are
strong
on
the
eighteenth
century
in
cagliari
perhaps
it
is
the
last
bright
reality
to
them
the
nineteenth
hardly
counts
curious
the
children
in
cagliari
the
poor
seem
thoroughly
urchins
gay
and
wild
in
the
narrow
dark
streets
but
the
more
children
are
so
fine
so
extraordinarily
elegantly
dressed
it
quite
strikes
one
of
a
heap
not
so
much
the
the
children
all
the
chic
all
the
fashion
all
the
originality
is
expended
on
the
children
and
with
a
great
deal
of
success
better
than
kensington
gardens
very
often
and
they
promenade
with
papa
and
mama
with
such
alert
assurance
having
quite
brought
it
off
their
fashionable
who
would
have
expected
it
oh
narrow
dark
and
humid
streets
going
up
to
the
cathedral
like
crevices
i
narrowly
miss
a
huge
pail
of
which
comes
crashing
down
from
heaven
a
small
boy
who
was
playing
in
the
street
and
whose
miss
is
not
quite
a
clean
miss
looks
up
with
that
naïve
impersonal
wonder
with
which
children
stare
at
a
star
or
a
the
cathedral
must
have
been
a
fine
old
pagan
stone
fortress
once
now
it
has
come
as
it
were
through
the
mincing
machine
of
the
ages
and
oozed
out
baroque
and
sausagey
a
bit
like
the
horrible
baldachins
in
peter
at
rome
none
the
less
it
is
homely
and
with
a
rather
ragged
high
mass
trailing
across
the
pavement
towards
the
high
altar
since
it
is
almost
sunset
and
epiphany
it
feels
as
if
one
might
squat
in
a
corner
and
play
marbles
and
eat
bread
and
cheese
and
be
at
home
a
comfortable
churchey
feel
there
is
some
striking
filet
lace
on
the
various
and
joseph
must
be
a
prime
saint
he
has
an
altar
and
a
verse
of
invocation
praying
for
the
dying
oh
joseph
true
potential
father
of
our
lord
what
can
it
profit
a
man
i
wonder
to
be
the
potential
father
of
anybody
for
the
rest
i
am
not
baedeker
the
top
of
cagliari
is
the
fortress
the
old
gate
the
old
ramparts
of
fine
yellowish
sandstone
up
in
a
great
sweep
goes
the
rampart
wall
spanish
and
splendid
dizzy
and
the
road
creeping
down
again
at
the
foot
down
the
back
of
the
hill
there
lies
the
country
that
dead
plain
with
its
bunch
of
palms
and
a
fainting
sea
and
inland
again
hills
cagliari
must
be
on
a
single
loose
lost
bluff
of
rock
from
the
terrace
just
below
the
fortress
above
the
town
not
behind
it
we
stand
and
look
at
the
sunset
it
is
all
terrible
taking
place
beyond
the
knotted
hills
that
lie
bluey
and
velvety
beyond
the
waste
lagoons
dark
sultry
heavy
crimson
the
west
is
hanging
sinisterly
with
those
gloomy
blue
and
drawn
across
all
behind
the
peaks
stretches
the
curtain
of
sinister
smouldering
red
and
away
to
the
sea
deep
below
lie
the
they
seem
miles
and
miles
and
utterly
waste
but
the
crosses
like
a
bridge
and
has
a
road
all
the
air
is
dark
a
sombre
bluish
tone
the
great
west
burns
inwardly
sullenly
and
gives
no
glow
yet
a
deep
red
it
is
cold
we
go
down
the
steep
streets
smelly
dark
dank
and
very
cold
no
wheeled
vehicle
can
scramble
up
them
presumably
people
live
in
one
room
men
are
combing
their
hair
or
fastening
their
collars
in
the
doorways
evening
is
here
and
it
is
a
feast
day
at
the
bottom
of
the
street
we
come
to
a
little
bunch
of
masked
youths
one
in
a
long
yellow
frock
and
a
frilled
bonnet
another
like
an
old
woman
another
in
red
twill
they
are
arm
in
arm
and
are
accosting
the
the
gives
a
cry
and
looks
for
escape
she
has
a
terror
of
maskers
a
terror
that
comes
from
childhood
to
say
the
truth
so
have
i
we
hasten
invisibly
down
the
far
side
of
the
street
and
come
out
under
the
bastions
then
we
go
down
our
own
familiar
wide
short
cold
boulevard
to
the
sea
at
the
bottom
again
is
a
carriage
with
more
maskers
carnival
is
beginning
a
man
dressed
as
a
peasant
woman
in
native
costume
is
clambering
with
his
great
wide
skirts
and
wide
strides
on
to
the
box
and
flourishing
his
ribboned
whip
is
addressing
a
little
crowd
of
listeners
he
opens
his
mouth
wide
and
goes
on
with
a
long
yelling
harangue
of
taking
a
drive
with
his
mother
another
man
in
gaudy
finery
and
wig
who
sits
already
bobbing
on
the
box
the
daughter
flourishes
yells
and
prances
up
there
on
the
box
of
the
carriage
the
crowd
listens
attentively
and
mildly
smiles
it
all
seems
real
to
them
the
hovers
in
the
distance
and
watches
with
a
great
flourish
of
whip
and
legs
showing
his
frilled
drawers
the
masker
pulls
round
to
drive
along
the
boulevard
by
the
sea
the
only
place
where
one
can
drive
the
big
street
by
the
sea
is
the
via
roma
it
has
the
cafés
on
one
side
and
across
the
road
the
thick
tufts
of
trees
intervening
between
the
sea
and
us
among
these
thick
tufts
of
trees
the
little
steam
tram
like
a
little
train
bumps
to
rest
after
having
wound
round
the
back
of
the
town
the
via
roma
is
all
social
cagliari
including
the
cafés
with
their
outdoor
tables
on
the
one
side
of
the
road
and
the
avenue
strand
on
the
other
it
is
very
wide
and
at
evening
it
contains
the
whole
town
here
and
here
alone
carriages
can
spank
along
very
slowly
officers
can
ride
and
the
people
can
promenade
en
masse
we
were
amazed
at
the
sudden
crowd
we
found
ourselves
amongst
like
a
short
dense
river
of
people
streaming
slowly
in
a
mass
there
is
practically
no
vehicular
traffic
only
the
steady
dense
streams
of
human
beings
of
all
sorts
all
on
a
human
footing
it
must
have
been
something
like
this
in
the
streets
of
imperial
rome
where
no
chariots
might
drive
and
humanity
was
all
on
foot
little
bunches
of
maskers
and
single
maskers
danced
and
strutted
along
in
the
thick
flow
under
the
trees
if
you
are
a
mask
you
do
walk
like
a
human
being
you
dance
and
prance
along
extraordinarily
like
the
marionettes
conducted
by
wires
from
above
that
is
how
you
go
with
that
odd
jauntiness
as
if
lifted
and
propelled
by
wires
from
the
shoulders
in
front
of
me
went
a
charming
coloured
harlequin
all
in
colours
and
beautiful
as
a
piece
of
china
he
tripped
with
the
light
fantastic
trip
quite
alone
in
the
thick
crowd
and
quite
blithe
came
two
little
children
hand
in
hand
in
brilliant
scarlet
and
white
costumes
sauntering
calmly
they
did
not
do
the
mask
trip
after
a
while
a
girl
with
a
high
hat
and
full
skirts
very
short
that
went
as
a
ballet
dancer
whilst
she
strutted
after
her
a
spanish
grandee
capering
like
a
monkey
they
threaded
among
the
slow
stream
of
the
crowd
appeared
dante
and
beatrice
in
paradise
apparently
all
in
white
and
with
silver
wreaths
on
their
heads
arm
in
arm
and
prancing
very
slowly
and
majestically
yet
with
the
long
lilt
as
if
hitched
along
by
wires
from
above
they
were
very
good
all
the
vision
come
to
life
dante
incorporate
and
white
as
a
shroud
with
his
immortal
beatrice
on
his
arm
strutting
the
dark
avenues
he
had
the
nose
and
and
banded
cheek
and
the
stupid
wooden
look
and
offered
a
modern
criticism
on
the
inferno
it
had
become
quite
dark
the
lamps
were
lighted
we
crossed
the
road
to
the
café
roma
and
found
a
table
on
the
pavement
among
the
crowd
in
a
moment
we
had
our
tea
the
evening
was
cold
with
ice
in
the
wind
but
the
crowd
surged
on
back
and
forth
back
and
forth
slowly
at
the
tables
were
seated
mostly
men
taking
coffee
or
vermouth
or
aqua
vitae
all
familiar
and
easy
without
the
modern
there
was
a
certain
pleasant
natural
robustness
of
spirit
and
something
of
a
feudal
then
arrived
a
family
with
children
and
nurse
in
her
native
costume
they
all
sat
at
table
together
perfectly
easy
with
one
another
though
the
marvellous
nurse
seemed
to
be
seated
below
the
salt
she
was
bright
as
a
poppy
in
a
dress
of
fine
cloth
with
a
curious
little
waistcoat
of
emerald
green
and
purple
and
a
bodice
of
soft
homespun
linen
with
great
full
sleeves
on
her
head
she
had
a
and
white
and
she
wore
great
studs
of
gold
filigree
and
similar
the
family
drank
its
and
watched
the
crowd
most
remarkable
is
the
complete
absence
of
they
all
have
a
perfect
natural
the
nurse
in
her
marvellous
native
costume
is
as
thoroughly
at
her
ease
as
if
she
were
in
her
own
village
street
she
moves
and
speaks
and
calls
to
a
without
the
slightest
constraint
and
much
more
without
the
slightest
presumption
she
is
below
the
invisible
salt
the
invisible
but
insuperable
salt
and
it
strikes
me
the
is
a
fine
thing
for
both
parties
they
both
remain
natural
and
human
on
either
side
of
it
instead
of
becoming
devilish
scrambling
and
pushing
at
the
barricade
the
crowd
is
across
the
road
under
the
trees
near
the
sea
on
this
side
stroll
occasional
pedestrians
and
i
see
my
first
peasant
in
costume
he
is
an
elderly
upright
handsome
man
beautiful
in
the
costume
he
wears
the
white
shirt
and
the
close
black
bodice
of
thick
native
frieze
cut
low
from
this
sticks
out
a
short
kilt
or
frill
of
the
same
black
frieze
a
band
of
which
goes
between
the
legs
between
the
full
loose
drawers
of
coarse
linen
the
drawers
are
banded
below
the
knee
into
tight
black
frieze
gaiters
on
his
head
he
has
the
long
black
stocking
cap
hanging
down
behind
how
handsome
he
is
and
so
beautifully
male
he
walks
with
his
hands
loose
behind
his
back
slowly
upright
and
aloof
the
lovely
unapproachableness
indomitable
and
the
flash
of
the
black
and
white
the
slow
stride
of
the
full
white
drawers
the
black
gaiters
and
black
cuirass
with
the
bolero
then
the
great
white
sleeves
and
white
breast
again
and
once
more
the
black
cap
what
marvellous
massing
of
the
contrast
marvellous
and
superb
as
on
a
how
beautiful
maleness
is
if
it
finds
its
right
and
how
perfectly
ridiculous
it
is
made
in
modern
clothes
there
is
another
peasant
too
a
young
one
with
a
swift
eye
and
hard
cheek
and
hard
dangerous
thighs
he
has
folded
his
stocking
cap
so
that
it
comes
forward
to
his
brow
like
a
phrygian
cap
he
wears
close
knee
breeches
and
close
sleeved
waistcoat
of
thick
brownish
stuff
that
looks
like
leather
over
the
waistcoat
a
sort
of
cuirass
of
black
rusty
sheepskin
the
curly
wool
outside
so
he
strides
talking
to
a
comrade
how
fascinating
it
is
after
the
soft
italians
to
see
these
limbs
in
their
close
so
definite
so
manly
with
the
old
fierceness
in
them
still
one
realises
with
horror
that
the
race
of
men
is
almost
extinct
in
europe
only
heroes
and
don
juans
and
rabid
the
old
hardy
indomitable
male
is
gone
his
fierce
singleness
is
quenched
the
last
sparks
are
dying
out
in
sardinia
and
spain
nothing
left
but
the
and
the
mongrelism
and
the
wistful
poisonous
cultured
soul
how
detestable
but
that
curious
flashing
costume
i
seem
to
have
known
it
before
to
have
worn
it
even
to
have
dreamed
it
to
have
dreamed
it
to
have
had
actual
contact
with
it
it
belongs
in
some
way
to
something
in
me
to
my
past
perhaps
i
do
know
but
the
uneasy
sense
of
haunts
me
i
i
have
known
it
before
it
is
something
of
the
same
uneasiness
i
feel
before
mount
eryx
but
without
the
awe
this
time
in
the
morning
the
sun
was
shining
from
a
blue
blue
sky
but
the
shadows
were
deadly
cold
and
the
wind
like
a
flat
blade
of
ice
we
went
out
running
to
the
sun
the
hotel
could
not
give
us
coffee
and
milk
only
a
little
black
coffee
so
we
descended
to
the
again
to
the
via
roma
and
to
our
café
it
was
friday
people
seemed
to
be
bustling
in
from
the
country
with
huge
baskets
the
café
roma
had
coffee
and
milk
but
no
butter
we
sat
and
watched
the
movement
outside
tiny
sardinian
donkeys
the
tiniest
things
ever
seen
trotted
their
infinitesimal
little
paws
along
the
road
drawing
little
wagons
like
handcarts
their
proportion
is
so
small
that
they
make
a
boy
walking
at
their
side
look
like
a
tall
man
while
a
natural
man
looks
like
a
cyclops
stalking
hugely
and
cruelly
it
is
ridiculous
for
a
grown
man
to
have
one
of
these
little
creatures
hardly
bigger
than
a
fly
hauling
his
load
for
him
one
is
pulling
a
chest
of
drawers
on
a
cart
and
it
seems
to
have
a
whole
house
behind
it
nevertheless
it
plods
bravely
away
beneath
the
load
a
wee
thing
they
tell
me
there
used
to
be
flocks
of
these
donkeys
feeding
half
wild
on
the
wild
hills
of
sardinia
but
the
war
and
also
the
imbecile
wantonness
of
the
consumed
these
flocks
too
so
that
few
are
left
the
same
with
the
cattle
sardinia
home
of
cattle
hilly
little
argentine
of
the
mediterranean
is
now
almost
deserted
it
is
war
say
the
and
also
the
wanton
imbecile
foul
lavishness
of
the
it
was
not
alone
the
war
which
exhausted
the
world
it
was
the
deliberate
evil
wastefulness
of
the
in
their
own
countries
italy
ruined
italy
two
peasants
in
are
strolling
in
the
sun
flashing
and
my
dream
of
last
evening
was
not
a
dream
and
my
nostalgia
for
something
i
know
not
what
was
not
an
illusion
i
feel
it
again
at
once
at
the
sight
of
the
men
in
frieze
and
linen
a
heart
yearning
for
something
i
have
known
and
which
i
want
back
again
it
is
market
day
we
turn
up
the
largo
the
second
wide
gap
of
a
street
a
vast
but
very
short
boulevard
like
the
end
of
something
cagliari
is
like
that
all
bits
and
bobs
and
by
the
side
of
the
pavement
are
many
stalls
stalls
selling
combs
and
cheap
mirrors
handkerchiefs
shoddy
manchester
goods
poor
crockery
and
so
on
but
we
see
also
madame
of
cagliari
going
marketing
with
a
servant
accompanying
her
carrying
a
huge
basket
or
returning
from
marketing
followed
by
a
small
boy
supporting
one
of
these
huge
baskets
like
huge
dishes
on
his
head
piled
with
bread
eggs
vegetables
a
chicken
and
so
forth
therefore
we
follow
madame
going
marketing
and
find
ourselves
in
the
vast
market
house
and
it
fairly
glows
with
eggs
eggs
in
these
great
round
of
golden
grass
but
eggs
in
piles
in
mounds
in
heaps
a
sierra
nevada
of
eggs
glowing
warm
white
how
they
glow
i
have
never
noticed
it
before
but
they
give
off
a
warm
pearly
effulgence
into
the
air
almost
a
warmth
a
heat
seems
to
come
out
of
them
myriads
of
eggs
glowing
avenues
of
eggs
and
they
are
marked
centimes
centimes
ah
cries
the
i
must
live
in
cagliari
for
in
sicily
the
eggs
cost
each
this
is
the
meat
and
poultry
and
bread
market
there
are
stalls
of
new
bread
brown
and
bright
there
are
tiny
stalls
of
marvellous
native
cakes
which
i
want
to
taste
there
is
a
great
deal
of
meat
and
kid
and
there
are
stalls
of
cheese
all
cheeses
all
shapes
all
whitenesses
all
the
on
into
daffodil
yellow
goat
cheese
sheeps
cheese
swiss
cheese
parmegiano
stracchino
caciocavallo
torolone
how
many
cheeses
i
do
know
the
names
of
but
they
cost
about
the
same
as
in
sicily
eighteen
francs
twenty
francs
francs
the
kilo
and
there
is
lovely
ham
thirty
and
francs
the
kilo
there
is
a
little
fresh
butter
too
thirty
or
francs
the
kilo
most
of
the
butter
however
is
tinned
in
milan
it
costs
the
same
as
the
fresh
there
are
splendid
piles
of
salted
black
olives
and
huge
bowls
of
green
salted
olives
there
are
chickens
and
ducks
and
at
eleven
and
twelve
and
fourteen
francs
a
kilo
there
is
mortadella
the
enormous
bologna
sausage
thick
as
a
church
pillar
francs
and
there
are
various
sorts
of
smaller
sausage
salami
to
be
eaten
in
slices
a
wonderful
abundance
of
food
glowing
and
shining
we
are
rather
late
for
fish
especially
on
friday
but
a
barefooted
man
offers
us
two
weird
objects
from
the
mediterranean
which
teems
with
marine
monsters
the
peasant
women
sit
behind
their
wares
their
linen
skirts
hugely
full
and
of
various
colours
ballooning
round
them
the
yellow
baskets
give
off
a
glow
of
light
there
is
a
sense
of
profusion
once
more
but
alas
no
sense
of
cheapness
save
the
eggs
every
month
up
goes
the
price
of
everything
i
must
come
and
live
in
cagliari
to
do
my
shopping
here
says
the
i
must
have
one
of
those
big
grass
baskets
we
went
down
to
the
little
street
but
saw
more
baskets
emerging
from
a
broad
flight
of
stone
stairs
enclosed
so
up
we
found
ourselves
in
the
vegetable
market
here
the
was
happier
still
peasant
women
sometimes
barefoot
sat
in
their
tight
little
bodices
and
voluminous
coloured
skirts
behind
the
piles
of
vegetables
and
never
have
i
seen
a
lovelier
show
the
intense
deep
green
of
spinach
seemed
to
predominate
and
out
of
that
came
the
monuments
of
and
cauliflowers
but
marvellous
cauliflowers
like
a
the
purple
ones
intense
as
great
bunches
of
violets
from
this
green
white
and
purple
massing
struck
out
the
vivid
and
blue
crimson
of
radishes
large
radishes
like
little
turnips
in
piles
then
the
long
slim
buds
of
artichokes
and
dangling
clusters
of
dates
and
piles
of
white
figs
and
black
figs
and
bright
burnt
figs
basketfuls
and
basketfuls
of
figs
a
few
baskets
of
almonds
and
many
huge
walnuts
of
native
raisins
scarlet
peppers
like
trumpets
magnificent
fennels
so
white
and
big
and
succulent
baskets
of
new
potatoes
scaly
kohlrabi
wild
asparagus
in
bunches
sparacelli
big
carrots
feathery
salads
with
white
hearts
long
onions
and
then
of
course
pyramids
of
big
oranges
pyramids
of
pale
apples
and
baskets
of
brilliant
shiny
mandarini
the
little
tangerine
orange
with
their
leaves
the
green
and
world
of
i
have
never
seen
in
such
splendour
as
under
the
market
roof
at
cagliari
so
raw
and
gorgeous
and
all
quite
cheap
the
one
remaining
cheapness
except
potatoes
potatoes
of
any
sort
are
or
the
kilo
oh
cried
the
if
i
do
live
at
cagliari
and
come
and
do
my
shopping
here
i
shall
die
with
one
of
my
wishes
unfulfilled
but
out
of
the
sun
it
was
cold
nevertheless
we
went
into
the
streets
to
try
and
get
warm
the
sun
was
powerful
but
alas
as
in
southern
towns
generally
the
streets
are
sunless
as
wells
so
the
and
i
creep
slowly
along
the
sunny
bits
and
then
perforce
are
swallowed
by
shadow
we
look
at
the
shops
but
there
is
not
much
to
see
little
frowsy
provincial
shops
on
the
whole
but
a
fair
number
of
peasants
in
the
streets
and
peasant
women
in
rather
ordinary
costume
dresses
of
linen
or
thickish
cotton
the
prettiest
is
of
intermingled
so
made
that
the
gathers
round
the
waist
into
one
colour
the
myriad
pleats
hiding
all
the
rosy
red
but
when
she
walks
the
peasant
woman
then
the
red
goes
like
a
bird
showing
its
colours
pretty
that
looks
in
the
sombre
street
she
has
a
plain
light
bodice
with
a
peak
sometimes
a
little
vest
and
great
full
white
sleeves
and
usually
a
handkerchief
or
shawl
loose
knotted
it
is
charming
the
way
they
walk
with
quick
short
steps
when
all
is
said
and
done
the
most
attractive
costume
for
women
in
my
eye
is
the
tight
little
bodice
and
the
skirt
full
and
vibrating
with
movement
it
has
a
charm
which
modern
elegance
lacks
completely
a
play
in
movement
they
are
amusing
these
peasant
girls
and
women
so
brisk
and
defiant
they
have
straight
backs
like
little
walls
and
decided
brows
and
they
are
amusingly
on
the
alert
there
is
no
eastern
creeping
like
sharp
brisk
birds
they
dart
along
the
streets
and
you
feel
they
would
fetch
you
a
bang
over
the
head
as
leave
as
look
at
you
tenderness
thank
heaven
does
not
seem
to
be
a
sardinian
quality
italy
is
so
tender
like
cooked
macaroni
yards
and
yards
of
soft
tenderness
ravelled
round
everything
here
men
do
idealise
women
by
the
looks
of
things
here
they
do
make
these
great
leering
eyes
the
inevitable
look
of
italian
males
when
the
men
from
the
country
look
at
these
women
then
it
is
my
lady
i
should
think
the
grovelling
is
not
much
of
a
sardinian
feature
these
women
have
to
look
out
for
themselves
keep
their
own
stiff
and
their
knuckles
hard
man
is
going
to
be
male
lord
if
he
can
and
woman
is
going
to
give
him
too
much
of
his
own
way
either
so
there
you
have
it
the
fine
old
martial
split
between
the
sexes
it
is
tonic
and
splendid
really
after
so
much
sticky
intermingling
and
backboneless
the
sardinian
is
looking
for
the
noble
woman
nobly
planned
no
thank
you
he
wants
that
young
madam
over
there
a
young
generation
that
she
is
far
better
sport
than
with
the
sort
hollow
frauds
that
they
are
better
sport
too
than
with
a
carmen
who
gives
herself
away
too
much
in
these
women
there
is
something
shy
and
defiant
and
the
defiant
splendid
split
between
the
sexes
each
absolutely
determined
to
defend
his
side
her
side
from
assault
so
the
meeting
has
a
certain
wild
salty
savour
each
the
deadly
unknown
to
the
other
and
at
the
same
time
each
his
own
her
own
native
pride
and
courage
taking
the
dangerous
leap
and
scrambling
back
give
me
the
old
salty
way
of
love
how
i
am
nauseated
with
sentiment
and
nobility
the
macaroni
mess
of
modern
adorations
one
sees
a
few
fascinating
faces
in
cagliari
those
great
dark
unlighted
eyes
there
are
fascinating
dark
eyes
in
sicily
bright
big
with
an
impudent
point
of
light
and
a
curious
roll
and
long
lashes
the
eyes
of
old
greece
surely
but
here
one
sees
eyes
of
soft
blank
darkness
all
velvet
with
no
imp
looking
out
of
them
and
they
strike
a
stranger
older
note
before
the
soul
became
before
the
mentality
of
greece
appeared
in
the
world
remote
always
remote
as
if
the
intelligence
lay
deep
within
the
cave
and
never
came
forward
one
searches
into
the
gloom
for
one
second
while
the
glance
lasts
but
without
being
able
to
penetrate
to
the
reality
it
recedes
like
some
unknown
creature
deeper
into
its
lair
there
is
a
creature
dark
and
potent
but
what
sometimes
velasquez
and
sometimes
goya
gives
us
a
suggestion
of
these
large
dark
unlighted
eyes
and
they
go
with
fine
fleecy
black
hair
almost
as
fine
as
fur
i
have
not
seen
them
north
of
cagliari
the
spies
some
of
the
cotton
stuff
of
which
the
peasants
make
their
dress
a
large
roll
in
the
doorway
of
a
dark
shop
in
we
go
and
begin
to
feel
it
it
is
just
soft
thickish
cotton
stuff
twelve
francs
a
metre
like
most
peasant
patterns
it
is
much
more
complicated
and
subtle
than
appears
the
curious
placing
of
the
stripes
the
subtle
proportion
and
a
white
thread
left
down
one
side
only
of
each
broad
blue
block
the
stripes
moreover
run
the
cloth
not
lengthwise
with
it
but
the
width
would
be
just
long
enough
for
a
skirt
though
the
peasant
skirts
have
almost
all
a
band
at
the
bottom
with
the
stripes
running
the
man
he
is
the
esquimo
type
simple
frank
and
aimiable
says
the
stuff
is
made
in
france
and
this
the
first
roll
since
the
war
it
is
the
old
old
pattern
quite
correct
but
the
material
not
so
good
the
takes
enough
for
a
dress
he
shows
us
also
cashmeres
orange
scarlet
royal
blue
good
cashmeres
that
were
being
sent
to
india
and
were
captured
from
a
german
mercantile
so
he
says
fifty
francs
a
metre
very
very
wide
but
they
are
too
much
trouble
to
carry
in
a
knapsack
though
their
brilliance
fascinates
so
we
stroll
and
look
at
the
shops
at
the
filigree
gold
jewelling
of
the
peasants
at
a
good
bookshop
but
there
is
little
to
see
and
therefore
the
question
is
shall
we
go
on
shall
we
go
forward
there
are
two
ways
of
leaving
cagliari
for
the
north
the
state
railway
that
runs
up
the
west
side
of
the
island
and
the
secondary
railway
that
pierces
the
centre
but
we
are
too
late
for
the
big
trains
so
we
will
go
by
the
secondary
railway
wherever
it
goes
there
is
a
train
at
and
we
can
get
as
far
as
mandas
some
fifty
miles
in
the
interior
when
we
tell
the
queer
little
waiter
at
the
hotel
he
says
he
comes
from
mandas
and
there
are
two
inns
so
after
lunch
a
strictly
fish
menu
we
pay
our
bill
it
comes
to
sixty
odd
francs
for
three
good
meals
each
with
wine
and
the
night
lodging
this
is
cheap
as
prices
now
are
in
italy
pleased
with
the
simple
and
friendly
scala
di
ferre
i
shoulder
my
sack
and
we
walk
off
to
the
second
station
the
sun
is
shining
hot
this
afternoon
burning
hot
by
the
sea
the
road
and
the
buildings
look
dry
and
desiccated
the
harbour
rather
weary
and
end
of
the
world
there
is
a
great
crowd
of
peasants
at
the
little
station
and
almost
every
man
has
a
pair
of
woven
a
great
flat
strip
of
wool
with
flat
pockets
at
either
end
stuffed
with
purchases
these
are
almost
the
only
carrying
bags
the
men
sling
them
over
their
shoulder
so
that
one
great
pocket
hangs
in
front
one
behind
these
saddle
bags
are
most
fascinating
they
are
coarsely
woven
in
bands
of
raw
wool
with
varying
bands
of
raw
white
wool
or
hemp
or
cotton
the
bands
and
stripes
of
varying
widths
going
and
on
the
pale
bands
are
woven
sometimes
flowers
in
most
lovely
colours
and
blue
and
green
peasant
patterns
and
sometimes
fantastic
animals
beasts
in
dark
wool
again
so
that
these
striped
zebra
bags
some
wonderful
gay
with
flowery
colours
on
their
stripes
some
weird
with
fantastic
animals
are
a
whole
landscape
in
themselves
the
train
has
only
first
and
third
class
it
costs
about
thirty
francs
for
the
two
of
us
third
class
to
mandas
which
is
some
sixty
miles
in
we
crowd
with
the
joyful
into
the
wooden
carriage
with
its
many
seats
and
wonder
of
wonders
punctually
to
the
second
off
we
go
out
of
cagliari
en
route
again
iv
mandas
the
coach
was
fairly
full
of
people
returning
from
market
on
these
railways
the
third
class
coaches
are
not
divided
into
compartments
they
are
left
open
so
that
one
sees
everybody
as
down
a
room
the
attractive
were
disposed
anywhere
and
the
bulk
of
the
people
settled
down
to
a
lively
it
is
much
nicest
on
the
whole
to
travel
third
class
on
the
railway
there
is
space
there
is
air
and
it
is
like
being
in
a
lively
inn
everybody
in
good
spirits
at
our
end
was
plenty
of
room
just
across
the
gangway
was
an
elderly
couple
like
two
children
coming
home
very
happily
he
was
fat
fat
all
over
with
a
white
moustache
and
a
little
frown
she
was
a
tall
lean
brown
woman
in
a
brown
dress
and
black
apron
with
huge
pocket
she
wore
no
head
covering
and
her
iron
grey
hair
was
parted
smoothly
they
were
rather
pleased
and
excited
being
in
the
train
she
took
all
her
money
out
of
her
big
pocket
and
counted
it
and
gave
it
to
him
all
the
ten
lira
notes
and
the
five
lira
and
the
two
and
the
one
peering
at
the
dirty
scraps
of
notes
to
see
if
they
were
good
then
she
gave
him
her
and
he
stowed
them
away
in
the
trouser
pocket
standing
up
to
push
them
down
his
fat
leg
and
then
one
saw
to
one
amazement
that
the
whole
of
his
was
left
out
behind
like
a
sort
of
apron
worn
backwards
why
a
mystery
he
was
one
of
those
fat
unheeding
men
with
a
little
masterful
frown
such
as
usually
have
tall
lean
obedient
wives
they
were
very
happy
with
amazement
he
watched
us
taking
hot
tea
from
the
thermos
flask
i
think
he
too
had
suspected
it
might
be
a
bomb
he
had
blue
eyes
and
white
eyebrows
beautiful
hot
he
said
seeing
the
tea
steam
it
is
the
inevitable
exclamation
does
it
do
you
good
yes
said
the
much
good
and
they
both
nodded
complacently
they
were
going
home
the
train
was
running
over
the
past
the
palm
trees
past
the
buildings
at
a
level
crossing
the
woman
darted
out
vigorously
with
her
red
flag
and
we
rambled
into
the
first
village
it
was
built
of
houses
thick
adobe
with
tile
ridges
to
keep
off
the
rain
in
the
enclosures
were
dark
orange
trees
but
the
villages
looked
foreign
the
next
thing
to
mere
earth
they
seem
like
or
coyote
colonies
looking
back
one
sees
cagliari
bluff
on
her
rock
rather
fine
with
the
thin
edge
of
the
sea
blade
curving
round
it
is
rather
hard
to
believe
in
the
real
sea
on
this
sort
of
plain
but
soon
we
begin
to
climb
to
the
hills
and
soon
the
cultivation
begins
to
be
intermittent
extraordinary
how
the
heathy
hills
come
near
the
sea
extraordinary
how
scrubby
and
uninhabited
the
great
spaces
of
sardinia
are
it
is
wild
with
heath
and
arbutus
scrub
and
a
sort
of
myrtle
sometimes
one
sees
a
few
head
of
cattle
and
then
again
come
the
greyish
where
the
corn
is
grown
it
is
like
cornwall
like
the
land
end
region
here
and
there
in
the
distance
are
peasants
working
on
the
lonely
landscape
sometimes
it
is
one
man
alone
in
the
distance
showing
so
vividly
in
his
costume
small
and
like
a
solitary
magpie
and
curiously
distinct
all
the
strange
magic
of
sardinia
is
in
this
sight
among
the
low
hills
away
in
a
hollow
of
the
wide
landscape
one
solitary
figure
small
but
vivid
working
alone
as
if
eternally
there
are
patches
and
hollows
of
grey
arable
land
good
for
corn
sardinia
was
once
a
great
granary
usually
however
the
peasants
of
the
south
have
left
off
the
costume
usually
it
is
the
invisible
soldiers
cloth
the
italian
khaki
wherever
you
go
wherever
you
be
you
see
this
khaki
this
how
many
millions
of
yards
of
the
thick
excellent
but
hateful
material
the
italian
government
must
have
provided
i
do
know
but
enough
to
cover
italy
with
a
felt
carpet
i
should
think
it
is
everywhere
it
cases
the
tiny
children
in
stiff
and
neutral
frocks
and
coats
it
covers
their
extinguished
fathers
and
sometimes
it
even
encloses
the
women
in
its
warmth
it
is
symbolic
of
the
universal
grey
mist
that
has
come
over
men
the
extinguishing
of
all
bright
individuality
the
blotting
out
of
all
wild
singleness
oh
democracy
oh
khaki
democracy
this
is
very
different
from
italian
landscape
italy
is
almost
always
dramatic
and
perhaps
invariably
romantic
there
is
drama
in
the
plains
of
lombardy
and
romance
in
the
venetian
lagoons
and
sheer
scenic
excitement
in
nearly
all
the
hilly
parts
of
the
peninsula
perhaps
it
is
the
natural
floridity
of
formations
but
italian
landscape
is
really
landscape
to
be
represented
in
that
manner
which
makes
everything
rather
marvelous
and
very
topical
aqueducts
and
ruins
upon
mountains
and
craggy
ravines
and
wilhelm
meister
all
up
and
down
sardinia
is
another
thing
much
wider
much
more
ordinary
not
at
all
but
running
away
into
the
distance
unremarkable
ridges
of
hills
running
away
perhaps
to
a
bunch
of
dramatic
peaks
on
the
southwest
this
gives
a
sense
of
space
which
is
so
lacking
in
italy
lovely
space
about
one
and
traveling
distances
nothing
finished
nothing
final
it
is
like
liberty
itself
after
the
peaky
confinement
of
sicily
room
give
me
room
give
me
room
for
my
spirit
and
you
can
have
all
the
toppling
crags
of
romance
so
we
ran
on
through
the
gold
of
the
afternoon
across
a
wide
almost
celtic
landscape
of
hills
our
little
train
winding
and
puffing
away
very
nimbly
only
the
heath
and
scrub
is
too
big
and
for
a
celtic
land
the
horns
of
black
cattle
show
sometimes
after
a
long
pull
we
come
to
a
station
after
a
stretch
of
loneliness
each
time
it
looks
as
if
there
were
nothing
beyond
no
more
habitations
and
each
time
we
come
to
a
station
most
of
the
people
have
left
the
train
and
as
with
men
driving
in
a
gig
who
get
down
at
every
so
the
passengers
usually
alight
for
an
airing
at
each
station
our
old
fat
friend
stands
up
and
tucks
his
comfortably
in
his
trousers
which
trousers
all
the
time
make
one
hold
one
breath
for
they
seem
at
each
very
moment
to
be
just
dropping
right
down
and
he
clambers
out
followed
by
the
long
brown
stalk
of
a
wife
so
the
train
sits
comfortably
for
five
or
ten
minutes
in
the
way
the
trains
have
at
last
we
hear
whistles
and
horns
and
our
old
fat
friend
running
and
clinging
like
a
fat
crab
to
the
very
end
of
the
train
as
it
sets
off
at
the
same
instant
a
loud
shriek
and
a
bunch
of
shouts
from
outside
we
all
jump
up
there
down
the
line
is
the
long
brown
stork
of
a
wife
she
had
just
walked
back
to
a
house
some
hundred
yards
off
for
a
few
words
and
has
now
seen
the
train
moving
now
behold
her
with
her
hands
thrown
to
heaven
and
hear
the
wild
shriek
madonna
through
all
the
hubbub
but
she
picks
up
her
two
and
with
her
thin
legs
in
grey
stockings
starts
with
a
mad
rush
after
the
train
in
vain
the
train
inexorably
pursues
its
course
prancing
she
reaches
one
end
of
the
platform
as
we
leave
the
other
end
then
she
realizes
it
is
not
going
to
stop
for
her
and
then
oh
horror
her
long
arms
thrown
out
in
wild
supplication
after
the
retreating
train
then
flung
aloft
to
god
then
brought
down
in
absolute
despair
on
her
head
and
this
is
the
last
sight
we
have
of
her
clutching
her
poor
head
in
agony
and
doubling
forward
she
is
left
she
is
abandoned
the
poor
fat
husband
has
been
all
the
time
on
the
little
outside
platform
at
the
end
of
the
carriage
holding
out
his
hand
to
her
and
shouting
frenzied
scolding
to
her
and
frenzied
yells
for
the
train
to
stop
and
the
train
has
not
stopped
and
she
is
left
left
on
that
station
in
the
waning
light
so
his
face
all
bright
his
eyes
round
and
bright
as
two
stars
absolutely
transfigured
by
dismay
chagrin
anger
and
distress
he
comes
and
sits
in
his
seat
ablaze
stiff
speechless
his
face
is
almost
beautiful
in
its
blaze
of
conflicting
emotions
for
some
time
he
is
as
if
unconscious
in
the
midst
of
his
feelings
then
anger
and
resentment
crop
out
of
his
consternation
he
turns
with
a
flash
to
the
insidious
guard
why
could
they
stop
the
train
for
her
and
immediately
as
if
someone
had
set
fire
to
him
off
flares
the
guard
heh
the
train
ca
stop
for
every
person
convenience
the
train
is
a
train
the
is
a
what
did
the
old
woman
want
to
take
her
trips
down
the
line
for
heh
she
pays
the
penalty
for
her
own
inconsiderateness
had
paid
for
the
train
heh
and
the
fat
man
all
the
time
firing
off
his
unheeding
and
unheeded
answers
one
minute
only
one
minute
if
he
the
conductor
had
told
the
driver
if
he
the
conductor
had
shouted
a
poor
woman
not
another
train
what
was
she
going
to
do
her
ticket
and
no
money
a
poor
woman
there
was
a
train
back
to
cagliari
that
night
said
the
conductor
at
which
the
fat
man
nearly
burst
out
of
his
clothing
like
a
bursting
he
bounced
on
his
seat
what
good
was
that
what
good
was
a
train
back
to
cagliari
when
their
home
was
in
snelli
making
matters
worse
so
they
bounced
and
jerked
and
argued
at
one
another
to
their
content
then
the
conductor
retired
smiling
subtly
in
a
way
they
have
our
fat
friend
looked
at
us
with
hot
angry
ashamed
grieved
eyes
and
said
it
was
a
shame
yes
we
chimed
it
a
shame
whereupon
a
miss
who
said
she
came
from
some
collegio
at
cagliari
advanced
and
asked
a
number
of
impertinent
questions
in
a
tone
of
pert
sympathy
after
which
our
fat
friend
left
alone
covered
his
clouded
face
with
his
hand
turned
his
back
on
the
world
and
gloomed
it
had
all
been
so
dramatic
that
in
spite
of
ourselves
we
laughed
even
while
the
shed
a
few
tears
well
the
journey
lasted
hours
we
came
to
a
station
and
the
conductor
said
we
must
get
out
these
coaches
went
no
further
only
two
coaches
would
proceed
to
mandas
so
we
climbed
out
with
our
traps
and
our
fat
friend
with
his
the
picture
of
misery
the
one
coach
into
which
we
clambered
was
rather
crowded
the
only
other
coach
was
most
of
it
and
the
rest
of
the
train
was
freight
we
were
two
insignificant
passenger
wagons
at
the
end
of
a
long
string
of
and
trucks
there
was
an
empty
seat
so
we
sat
on
it
only
to
realize
after
about
five
minutes
that
a
thin
old
woman
with
two
children
her
grandchildren
was
chuntering
her
head
off
because
it
was
seat
why
she
had
left
it
she
did
say
and
under
my
legs
was
her
bundle
of
bread
she
nearly
went
off
her
head
and
over
my
head
on
the
little
rack
was
her
bercola
her
fat
soldiers
laughed
at
her
but
she
fluttered
and
flipped
like
a
tart
featherless
old
hen
since
she
had
another
seat
and
was
quite
comfortable
we
smiled
and
let
her
chunter
so
she
clawed
her
bread
bundle
from
under
my
legs
and
clutching
it
and
a
fat
child
sat
tense
it
was
getting
quite
dark
the
conductor
came
and
said
that
there
was
no
more
paraffin
if
what
there
was
in
the
lamps
gave
out
we
should
have
to
sit
in
the
dark
there
was
no
more
paraffin
all
along
the
so
he
climbed
on
the
seats
and
after
a
long
struggle
with
various
boys
striking
matches
for
him
he
managed
to
obtain
a
light
as
big
as
a
pea
we
sat
in
this
and
looked
at
the
faces
round
us
the
fat
soldier
with
a
gun
the
handsome
soldier
with
huge
the
weird
dark
little
man
who
kept
exchanging
a
baby
with
a
solid
woman
who
had
a
white
cloth
tied
round
her
head
a
tall
in
costume
who
darted
out
at
a
dark
station
and
returned
triumphant
with
a
piece
of
chocolate
a
young
and
interested
young
man
who
told
us
every
station
and
the
man
who
spat
there
is
always
one
gradually
the
crowd
thinned
at
a
station
we
saw
our
fat
friend
go
by
bitterly
like
a
betrayed
soul
his
bulging
hanging
before
and
after
but
no
comfort
in
it
now
no
comfort
the
pea
of
light
from
the
paraffin
lamp
grew
smaller
we
sat
in
incredible
dimness
and
the
smell
of
and
peasant
with
only
our
fat
and
stoic
young
man
to
tell
us
where
we
were
the
other
dusky
faces
began
to
sink
into
a
dead
gloomy
silence
some
took
to
sleep
and
the
little
train
ran
on
and
on
through
unknown
sardinian
darkness
in
despair
we
drained
the
last
drop
of
tea
and
ate
the
last
crusts
of
bread
we
knew
we
must
arrive
some
time
it
was
not
much
after
seven
when
we
came
to
mandas
mandas
is
a
junction
where
these
little
trains
sit
and
have
a
long
happy
chat
after
their
arduous
scramble
over
the
downs
it
had
taken
us
somewhere
about
five
hours
to
do
our
fifty
miles
no
wonder
then
that
when
the
junction
at
last
heaves
in
sight
everybody
bursts
out
of
the
train
like
seeds
from
an
exploding
pod
and
rushes
somewhere
for
something
to
the
station
restaurant
of
course
hence
there
is
a
little
station
restaurant
that
does
a
brisk
trade
and
where
one
can
have
a
bed
a
quite
pleasant
woman
behind
the
little
bar
a
brown
woman
with
brown
parted
hair
and
brownish
eyes
and
brownish
tanned
complexion
and
tight
brown
velveteen
bodice
she
led
us
up
a
narrow
winding
stone
stair
as
up
a
fortress
leading
on
with
her
candle
and
ushered
us
into
the
bedroom
it
smelled
horrid
and
sourish
as
shutup
bedrooms
do
we
threw
open
the
window
there
were
big
frosty
stars
snapping
ferociously
in
heaven
the
room
contained
a
huge
bed
big
enough
for
eight
people
and
quite
clean
and
the
table
on
which
stood
the
candle
actually
had
a
cloth
but
imagine
that
cloth
i
think
it
had
been
originally
white
now
however
it
was
such
a
web
of
holes
and
mournful
black
inkstains
and
poor
dead
wine
stains
that
it
was
like
some
i
wonder
if
it
could
have
been
lifted
from
that
table
or
if
it
was
mummified
on
to
it
i
for
one
made
no
attempt
to
try
but
that
impressed
me
as
showing
degrees
i
had
not
a
we
went
down
the
to
the
here
was
a
long
table
with
upside
down
and
a
lamp
burning
an
uncanny
naked
acetylene
flame
we
sat
at
the
cold
table
and
the
lamp
immediately
began
to
wane
the
room
in
fact
the
whole
of
sardinia
was
stone
cold
stone
stone
cold
outside
the
earth
was
freezing
inside
there
was
no
thought
of
any
sort
of
warmth
dungeon
stone
floors
dungeon
stone
walls
and
a
dead
atmosphere
too
heavy
and
icy
to
move
the
lamp
went
quite
out
and
the
gave
a
cry
the
brown
woman
poked
her
head
through
a
hole
in
the
wall
beyond
her
we
saw
the
flames
of
the
cooking
and
two
stirring
the
pots
the
brown
woman
came
and
shook
the
lamp
it
was
like
a
stodgy
porcelain
mantelpiece
vase
shook
it
well
and
stirred
up
its
innards
and
started
it
going
once
more
then
she
appeared
with
a
bowl
of
smoking
cabbage
soup
in
which
were
bits
of
macaroni
and
would
we
have
wine
i
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
red
wine
of
the
country
so
asked
what
else
there
was
there
was
malvagia
malvoisie
the
same
old
malmsey
that
did
for
the
duke
of
clarence
so
we
had
a
pint
of
malvagia
and
were
comforted
at
least
we
were
being
so
when
the
lamp
went
out
again
the
brown
woman
came
and
shook
and
smacked
it
and
started
it
off
again
but
as
if
to
say
sha
for
you
it
whipped
out
again
then
came
the
host
with
a
candle
and
a
pin
a
large
genial
sicilian
with
pendulous
mustaches
and
he
thoroughly
pricked
the
wretch
with
the
pin
shook
it
and
turned
little
screws
so
up
flared
the
flame
we
were
a
little
nervous
he
asked
us
where
we
came
from
etc
and
suddenly
he
asked
us
with
an
excited
gleam
were
we
socialists
aha
he
was
going
to
hail
us
as
citizens
and
comrades
he
thought
we
were
a
pair
of
bolshevist
agents
i
could
see
it
and
as
such
he
was
prepared
to
embrace
us
but
no
the
disclaimed
the
honor
i
merely
smiled
and
shook
my
head
it
is
a
pity
to
rob
people
of
their
exciting
illusions
ah
there
is
too
much
socialism
everywhere
cried
the
ma
perhaps
perhaps
said
the
discreet
sicilian
she
saw
which
way
the
land
lay
and
added
si
vuole
un
di
socialismo
one
wants
a
tiny
bit
of
socialism
in
the
world
a
tiny
bit
but
not
much
not
much
at
present
there
is
too
much
our
host
twinkling
at
this
speech
which
treated
of
the
sacred
creed
as
if
it
were
a
pinch
of
salt
in
the
broth
believing
the
was
throwing
dust
in
his
eyes
and
thoroughly
intrigued
by
us
as
a
pair
of
deep
ones
retired
no
sooner
had
he
gone
than
the
stood
up
at
its
full
length
and
started
to
whistle
the
drew
back
not
satisfied
by
this
another
flame
suddenly
began
to
whip
round
the
bottom
of
the
burner
like
a
lion
lashing
its
tail
unnerved
we
made
room
the
cried
again
in
came
the
host
with
a
subtle
smile
and
a
pin
and
an
air
of
benevolence
and
tamed
the
brute
what
else
was
there
to
eat
there
was
a
piece
of
fried
pork
for
me
and
boiled
eggs
for
the
as
we
were
proceeding
with
these
in
came
the
remainder
of
the
night
entertainment
three
station
officials
two
in
scarlet
peaked
caps
one
in
a
peaked
cap
they
sat
down
with
a
clamour
in
their
caps
as
if
there
was
a
sort
of
invisible
screen
between
us
and
them
they
were
young
the
black
cap
had
a
lean
and
sardonic
look
one
of
the
was
little
and
ruddy
very
young
with
a
little
mustache
we
called
him
the
the
gay
little
black
pig
he
was
so
plump
and
and
frisky
the
third
was
rather
puffy
and
pale
and
had
spectacles
they
all
seemed
to
present
us
the
blank
side
of
their
cheek
and
to
intimate
that
no
they
were
not
going
to
take
their
hats
off
even
if
it
were
and
a
strange
and
they
made
rough
quips
with
one
another
still
as
if
we
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
invisible
screen
determined
however
to
remove
this
invisible
screen
i
said
and
it
was
very
cold
they
muttered
and
yes
it
was
fresh
an
italian
never
says
it
is
cold
it
is
never
more
than
but
this
hint
that
it
was
cold
they
took
as
a
hint
at
their
caps
and
they
became
very
silent
till
the
woman
came
in
with
the
then
they
clamoured
at
her
particularly
the
what
was
there
to
eat
she
told
them
of
pork
whereat
they
pulled
faces
or
bits
of
boiled
pork
they
sighed
looked
gloomy
cheered
up
and
said
then
and
they
fell
on
their
soup
and
never
from
among
the
steam
have
i
heard
a
more
joyful
trio
of
they
sucked
it
in
from
their
spoons
with
long
sucks
the
was
the
treble
he
trilled
his
soup
into
his
mouth
with
a
swift
sucking
vibration
interrupted
by
bits
of
cabbage
which
made
the
lamp
start
to
dither
again
was
the
baritone
good
rolling
and
the
one
in
spectacles
was
the
bass
he
gave
sudden
deep
gulps
all
was
led
by
the
long
trilling
of
the
then
suddenly
to
vary
matters
he
cocked
up
his
spoon
in
one
hand
chewed
a
huge
mouthful
of
bread
and
swallowed
it
down
with
a
of
his
tongue
against
his
palate
as
children
we
used
to
call
this
clapping
mother
she
clapping
i
would
yell
with
anger
against
my
sister
the
german
word
is
schmatzen
so
the
clapped
like
a
pair
of
cymbals
while
baritone
and
bass
rolled
on
then
in
chimed
the
swift
bright
treble
at
this
rate
however
the
soup
did
not
last
long
arrived
the
of
pork
and
now
the
trio
was
a
trio
of
castanet
smacks
and
cymbal
claps
triumphantly
the
looked
around
he
all
the
bread
of
the
country
is
rather
coarse
and
brown
with
a
hard
hard
crust
a
large
rock
of
this
is
perched
on
every
damp
serviette
the
tore
his
rock
asunder
and
grumbled
at
the
who
had
got
a
weird
sort
of
of
pure
white
bread
starch
white
he
was
a
swell
with
this
white
bread
suddenly
turned
to
me
where
had
we
come
from
where
were
we
going
what
for
but
in
laconic
sardonic
tone
i
sardinia
cried
the
why
he
asked
sarcastically
and
she
tried
to
find
out
yes
the
sardinians
please
me
more
than
the
sicilians
said
i
why
he
asked
sarcastically
they
are
more
open
more
honest
he
seemed
to
turn
his
nose
down
the
padrone
is
a
sicilian
said
the
stuffing
a
huge
block
of
bread
into
his
mouth
and
rolling
his
insouciant
eyes
of
a
gay
little
black
pig
towards
the
background
we
were
making
much
headway
you
seen
cagliari
the
said
to
me
like
a
threat
yes
oh
cagliari
pleases
me
cagliari
is
beautiful
cried
the
who
travels
with
a
vial
of
melted
butter
ready
for
her
parsnips
yes
cagliari
is
cagliari
is
very
fair
said
the
black
cap
è
he
was
evidently
proud
of
it
and
is
mandas
nice
asked
the
in
what
way
nice
they
asked
with
immense
sarcasm
is
there
anything
to
see
hens
said
the
briefly
they
all
bristled
when
one
asked
if
mandas
was
nice
what
does
one
do
here
asked
the
at
mandas
one
does
at
mandas
one
goes
to
bed
when
it
dark
like
a
chicken
at
mandas
one
walks
down
the
road
like
a
pig
that
is
going
nowhere
at
mandas
a
goat
understands
more
than
the
inhabitants
understand
at
mandas
one
needs
socialism
they
all
cried
out
at
once
evidently
mandas
was
more
than
flesh
and
blood
could
bear
for
another
minute
to
these
three
conspirators
then
you
are
very
bored
here
say
i
yes
and
the
quiet
intensity
of
that
naked
yes
spoke
more
than
volumes
you
would
like
to
be
in
cagliari
yes
silence
intense
sardonic
silence
had
intervened
the
three
looked
at
one
another
and
made
a
sour
joke
about
mandas
then
the
turned
to
me
can
you
understand
sardinian
he
said
somewhat
more
than
sicilian
anyhow
but
sardinian
is
more
difficult
than
sicilian
it
is
full
of
words
utterly
unknown
to
italian
yes
but
say
i
it
is
spoken
openly
in
plain
words
and
sicilian
is
spoken
all
stuck
together
none
of
the
words
there
at
all
he
looks
at
me
as
if
i
were
an
imposter
yet
it
is
true
i
find
it
quite
easy
to
understand
sardinian
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
more
a
question
of
human
approach
than
of
sound
sardinian
seems
open
and
manly
and
downright
sicilian
is
gluey
and
evasive
as
if
the
sicilian
did
want
to
speak
straight
to
you
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
does
he
is
an
sensitive
ancient
soul
and
he
has
so
many
sides
to
his
mind
that
he
has
got
any
definite
one
mind
at
all
he
got
a
dozen
minds
and
uneasily
he
aware
of
it
and
to
commit
himself
to
anyone
of
them
is
merely
playing
a
trick
on
himself
and
his
interlocutor
the
sardinian
on
the
other
hand
still
seems
to
have
one
downright
mind
i
bump
up
against
a
downright
belief
in
socialism
for
example
the
sicilian
is
much
too
old
in
our
culture
to
swallow
socialism
whole
much
too
ancient
and
rusé
not
to
be
sophisticated
about
any
and
every
belief
he
go
off
like
a
squib
and
then
he
smoulder
acridly
and
sceptically
even
against
his
own
fire
one
sympathizes
with
him
in
retrospect
but
in
daily
life
it
is
unbearable
where
do
you
find
such
white
bread
say
i
to
the
black
cap
because
he
is
proud
of
it
it
comes
from
my
home
and
then
he
asks
about
the
bread
of
sicily
is
it
any
whiter
than
the
mandas
rock
yes
it
is
a
little
whiter
at
which
they
gloom
again
for
it
is
a
very
sore
point
this
bread
bread
means
a
great
deal
to
an
italian
it
is
verily
his
staff
of
life
he
practically
lives
on
bread
and
instead
of
going
by
taste
he
now
like
all
the
world
goes
by
eye
he
has
got
it
into
his
head
that
bread
should
be
white
so
that
every
time
he
fancies
a
darker
shade
in
the
loaf
a
shadow
falls
on
his
soul
nor
is
he
altogether
wrong
for
although
personally
i
do
like
white
bread
any
more
yet
i
do
like
my
brown
bread
to
be
made
of
pure
unmixed
flour
the
peasants
in
sicily
who
have
kept
their
own
wheat
and
make
their
own
natural
brown
bread
ah
it
is
amazing
how
fresh
and
sweet
and
their
loaf
seems
so
perfumed
as
used
all
to
be
before
the
war
whereas
the
bread
of
the
commune
the
regulation
supply
is
hard
and
rather
coarse
and
rough
so
rough
and
harsh
on
the
palate
one
gets
tired
to
death
of
it
i
suspect
myself
the
maize
meal
mixed
in
but
i
do
know
and
finally
the
bread
varies
immensely
from
town
to
town
from
commune
to
commune
the
just
and
equal
distribution
is
all
one
place
has
abundance
of
good
sweet
bread
another
scrapes
along
always
stinted
on
an
allowance
of
harsh
coarse
stuff
and
the
poor
suffer
bitterly
really
from
the
because
they
depend
so
on
this
one
food
they
say
the
inequality
and
the
injustice
of
distribution
comes
from
the
camorra
la
grande
camorra
which
is
no
more
nowadays
than
a
profiteering
combine
which
the
poor
hate
but
for
myself
i
do
know
i
only
know
that
one
town
venice
for
example
seems
to
have
an
endless
supply
of
pure
bread
of
sugar
of
tobacco
of
salt
while
florence
is
in
one
continual
ferment
of
irritation
over
the
stinting
of
these
supplies
which
are
all
government
monopoly
doled
out
accordingly
we
said
to
our
three
railway
friends
and
went
up
to
bed
we
had
only
been
in
the
room
a
minute
or
two
when
the
brown
woman
tapped
and
if
you
please
the
had
sent
us
one
of
his
little
white
loaves
we
were
really
touched
such
delicate
little
generosities
have
almost
disappeared
from
the
world
it
was
a
queer
little
bread
and
almost
as
hard
as
ships
biscuit
made
of
starch
flour
not
strictly
bread
at
all
the
night
was
cold
the
blankets
flat
and
heavy
but
one
slept
quite
well
till
dawn
at
seven
it
was
a
clear
cold
morning
the
sun
not
yet
up
standing
at
the
bedroom
window
looking
out
i
could
hardly
believe
my
eyes
it
was
so
like
england
like
cornwall
in
the
bleak
parts
or
derbyshire
uplands
there
was
a
little
at
the
back
of
the
station
rather
with
two
sheep
in
it
there
were
several
very
like
cornwall
and
then
the
wide
forlorn
country
road
stretched
away
between
borders
of
grass
and
low
drystone
walls
towards
a
grey
stone
farm
with
a
tuft
of
trees
and
a
naked
stone
village
in
the
distance
the
sun
came
up
yellow
the
bleak
country
glimmered
bluish
and
reluctant
the
low
green
were
divided
into
fields
with
low
drystone
walls
and
ditches
here
and
there
a
stone
barn
rose
alone
or
with
a
few
bare
windy
trees
attached
two
winter
horses
pastured
on
the
rough
grass
a
boy
came
along
the
naked
wide
with
a
couple
of
milk
cans
drifting
in
from
nowhere
and
it
was
all
so
like
cornwall
or
a
part
of
ireland
that
the
old
nostalgia
for
the
celtic
regions
began
to
spring
up
in
me
ah
those
old
drystone
walls
dividing
the
fields
pale
and
ah
the
dark
sombre
grass
the
naked
sky
the
forlorn
horses
in
the
wintry
morning
strange
is
a
celtic
landscape
far
more
moving
disturbing
than
the
lovely
glamor
of
italy
and
greece
before
the
curtains
of
history
lifted
one
feels
the
world
was
like
this
this
celtic
bareness
and
sombreness
and
but
perhaps
it
is
not
celtic
at
all
iberian
nothing
is
more
unsatisfactory
than
our
conception
of
what
is
celtic
and
what
is
not
celtic
i
believe
there
never
were
any
celts
as
a
as
for
the
iberians
illustration
tonara
wonderful
to
go
out
on
a
frozen
road
to
see
the
grass
in
shadow
bluish
with
to
see
the
grass
in
the
yellow
beams
melting
and
going
wonderful
the
bluish
cold
air
and
things
standing
up
in
cold
distance
after
two
southern
winters
with
roses
blooming
all
the
time
this
bleakness
and
this
touch
of
frost
in
the
ringing
morning
goes
to
my
soul
like
an
intoxication
i
am
so
glad
on
this
lonely
naked
road
i
do
know
what
to
do
with
myself
i
walk
down
in
the
shallow
grassy
ditches
under
the
loose
stone
walls
i
walk
on
the
little
ridge
of
grass
the
little
bank
on
which
the
wall
is
built
i
cross
the
road
across
the
frozen
and
it
is
all
so
familiar
to
my
my
very
feet
in
contact
that
i
am
wild
as
if
i
had
made
a
discovery
and
i
realize
that
i
hate
to
live
on
or
marble
or
any
of
those
limey
rocks
i
hate
them
they
are
dead
rocks
they
have
no
life
thrills
for
the
feet
even
sandstone
is
much
better
but
granite
granite
is
my
favorite
it
is
so
live
under
the
feet
it
has
a
deep
sparkle
of
its
own
i
like
its
roundnesses
and
i
hate
the
jaggy
dryness
of
that
burns
in
the
sun
and
withers
after
coming
to
a
deep
well
in
a
grassy
plot
in
a
wide
space
of
the
road
i
go
back
across
the
sunny
naked
upland
country
towards
the
pink
station
and
its
an
engine
is
steaming
its
white
clouds
in
the
new
light
away
to
the
left
there
is
even
a
row
of
small
houses
like
a
row
of
dwellings
strange
and
familiar
sight
and
the
station
precincts
are
disorderly
and
rather
dilapidated
i
think
of
our
sicilian
host
the
brown
woman
gives
us
coffee
and
very
strong
rich
goats
milk
and
bread
after
which
the
and
i
set
off
once
more
along
the
road
to
the
village
she
too
is
thrilled
she
too
breathes
deep
she
too
feels
around
her
and
freedom
to
move
the
limbs
such
as
one
does
not
feel
in
italy
and
sicily
where
all
is
so
classic
and
fixed
the
village
itself
is
just
a
long
winding
darkish
street
in
shadow
of
houses
and
shops
and
a
smithy
it
might
almost
be
cornwall
not
quite
something
i
do
know
what
suggests
the
stark
burning
glare
of
summer
and
then
of
course
there
is
none
of
the
cosiness
which
climbing
roses
and
lilac
trees
and
cottage
shops
and
haystacks
would
give
to
an
english
scene
this
is
harder
barer
starker
more
dreary
an
ancient
man
in
the
costume
comes
out
of
a
hovel
of
a
cottage
the
butcher
carries
a
huge
side
of
meat
the
women
peer
at
us
but
more
furtive
and
reticent
than
the
howling
stares
of
italy
so
we
go
on
down
the
street
through
the
whole
length
of
the
village
and
emerging
on
the
other
side
past
the
last
cottage
we
find
ourselves
again
facing
the
open
country
on
the
gentle
of
the
rolling
hill
the
landscape
continues
the
same
low
rolling
upland
hills
dim
under
the
yellow
sun
of
the
january
morning
stone
fences
fields
land
a
man
slowly
slowly
ploughing
with
a
pony
and
a
cow
the
road
trailing
empty
across
the
distance
and
then
the
one
violently
unfamiliar
note
the
enclosed
cemetery
lying
outside
on
the
gentle
closed
in
all
round
very
compact
with
high
walls
and
on
the
inside
face
of
the
enclosure
wall
the
marble
slabs
like
shut
drawers
of
the
sepulchres
shining
white
the
wall
being
like
a
chest
of
drawers
or
pigeon
holes
to
hold
the
dead
tufts
of
dark
and
plumy
cypresses
rise
among
the
flat
graves
of
the
enclosure
in
the
south
cemeteries
are
walled
off
and
isolated
very
tight
the
dead
as
it
were
are
kept
fast
in
pound
there
is
no
spreading
of
graves
over
the
face
of
the
country
they
are
penned
in
a
tight
fold
with
cypresses
to
fatten
on
the
bones
this
is
the
one
thoroughly
strange
note
in
the
landscape
but
there
is
a
strangeness
that
strange
feeling
as
if
the
were
barren
which
comes
in
the
south
and
the
east
and
the
heart
eaten
out
by
the
dryness
i
like
it
i
like
it
cries
the
but
could
you
live
here
she
would
like
to
say
yes
but
dare
we
stray
back
the
wants
to
buy
one
of
those
arrangements
i
say
what
for
she
says
to
keep
things
in
ach
but
peeping
in
the
shops
we
see
one
and
go
in
and
examine
it
it
is
quite
a
sound
one
properly
made
but
plain
quite
plain
on
the
white
there
are
no
lovely
colored
flowers
of
rose
and
green
and
magenta
the
three
favorite
sardinian
colors
nor
are
there
any
of
the
fantastic
and
beasts
so
it
wo
do
how
much
does
it
cost
francs
there
is
nothing
to
do
in
mandas
so
we
will
take
the
morning
train
and
go
to
the
terminus
to
sorgono
thus
we
shall
cross
the
lower
slopes
of
the
great
central
knot
of
sardinia
the
mountain
knot
called
gennargentu
and
sorgono
we
feel
will
be
lovely
back
at
the
station
we
make
tea
on
the
spirit
lamp
fill
the
thermos
pack
the
knapsack
and
the
kitchenino
and
come
out
into
the
sun
of
the
platform
the
goes
to
thank
the
for
the
white
bread
whilst
i
settle
the
bill
and
ask
for
food
for
the
journey
the
brown
woman
fishes
out
from
a
huge
black
pot
in
the
background
sundry
hunks
of
coarse
boiled
pork
and
gives
me
two
of
these
hot
with
bread
and
salt
this
is
the
luncheon
i
pay
the
bill
which
amounts
to
francs
for
everything
one
says
francs
or
liras
irrespective
in
italy
at
that
moment
arrives
the
train
from
cagliari
and
men
rush
in
roaring
for
the
soup
or
rather
for
the
broth
ready
ready
she
cries
going
to
the
black
pot
to
sorgono
the
various
trains
in
the
junction
squatted
side
by
side
and
had
long
long
talks
before
at
last
we
were
off
it
was
wonderful
to
be
running
in
the
bright
morning
towards
the
heart
of
sardinia
in
the
little
train
that
seemed
so
familiar
we
were
still
going
third
class
rather
to
the
disgust
of
the
railway
officials
at
mandas
at
first
the
country
was
rather
open
always
the
long
spurs
of
hills
but
not
high
and
from
our
little
train
we
looked
across
the
country
across
hill
and
dale
in
the
distance
was
a
little
town
on
a
low
slope
but
for
its
compact
fortified
look
it
might
have
been
a
town
on
the
english
downs
a
man
in
the
carriage
leaned
out
of
the
window
holding
out
a
white
cloth
as
a
signal
to
someone
in
the
far
off
town
that
he
was
coming
the
wind
blew
the
white
cloth
the
town
in
the
distance
glimmered
small
and
alone
in
its
hollow
and
the
little
train
pelted
along
it
was
rather
comical
to
see
it
we
were
always
climbing
and
the
line
curved
in
great
loops
so
that
as
one
looked
out
of
the
window
time
and
again
one
started
seeing
a
little
train
running
in
front
of
us
in
a
diverging
direction
making
big
puffs
of
steam
but
lo
it
was
our
own
little
engine
pelting
off
around
a
loop
away
ahead
we
were
quite
a
long
train
but
all
trucks
in
front
only
our
two
passenger
coaches
hitched
on
behind
and
for
this
reason
our
own
engine
was
always
running
fussily
into
sight
like
some
dog
scampering
in
front
and
swerving
about
us
while
we
followed
at
the
tail
end
of
the
thin
string
of
trucks
i
was
surprised
how
well
the
small
engine
took
the
continuous
steep
slopes
how
bravely
it
emerged
on
the
it
is
a
queer
railway
i
would
like
to
know
who
made
it
it
pelts
up
hill
and
down
dale
and
round
sudden
bends
in
the
most
unconcerned
fashion
not
as
proper
big
railways
do
grunting
inside
deep
cuttings
and
stinking
their
way
through
tunnels
but
running
up
the
hill
like
a
panting
small
dog
and
having
a
look
round
and
starting
off
in
another
direction
whisking
us
behind
unconcernedly
this
is
much
more
fun
than
the
system
they
told
me
that
sardinia
mines
her
own
coal
and
quite
enough
for
her
own
needs
but
very
soft
not
fit
for
i
saw
heaps
of
it
small
dull
stuff
of
it
too
and
of
grain
at
every
station
we
were
left
ignominiously
planted
while
the
little
engines
they
had
gay
gold
names
on
their
black
little
bodies
strolled
about
along
the
and
snuffed
at
the
various
trucks
there
we
sat
at
every
station
while
some
truck
was
discarded
and
some
other
sorted
out
like
a
branded
sheep
from
the
sidings
and
hitched
on
to
us
it
took
a
long
time
this
did
all
the
stations
so
far
had
had
wire
netting
over
the
windows
this
means
the
malaria
climbs
very
high
in
sardinia
the
shallow
upland
valleys
moorland
with
their
intense
summer
sun
and
the
riverless
boggy
behaviour
of
the
water
breed
the
pest
inevitably
but
not
very
terribly
as
far
as
one
can
make
out
august
and
september
being
the
danger
months
the
natives
do
like
to
admit
there
is
any
malaria
a
tiny
bit
they
say
a
tiny
bit
as
soon
as
you
come
to
the
there
is
no
more
so
they
say
for
many
miles
the
landscape
is
moorland
and
with
no
trees
but
wait
for
the
trees
ah
the
woods
and
forests
of
gennargentu
the
woods
and
forests
higher
up
no
malaria
there
the
little
engine
whisks
up
and
up
around
its
loopy
curves
as
if
it
were
going
to
bite
its
own
tail
we
being
the
tail
then
suddenly
dives
over
the
out
of
sight
and
the
landscape
changes
the
famous
woods
begin
to
appear
at
first
it
is
only
miles
of
all
wild
with
a
few
black
cattle
trying
to
peep
at
us
out
of
the
green
myrtle
and
arbutus
scrub
which
forms
the
undergrowth
and
a
couple
of
rare
wild
peasants
peering
at
the
train
they
wear
the
black
sheepskin
tunic
with
the
wool
outside
and
the
long
stocking
caps
like
cattle
they
too
peer
out
from
between
deep
bushes
the
myrtle
scrub
here
rises
and
cattle
and
men
are
smothered
in
it
the
big
hazels
rise
bare
above
it
must
be
difficult
getting
about
in
these
parts
sometimes
in
the
distance
one
sees
a
peasant
riding
lonely
across
a
more
open
place
a
tiny
vivid
figure
i
like
so
much
the
proud
instinct
which
makes
a
living
creature
distinguish
itself
from
its
background
i
hate
the
rabbity
khaki
a
peasant
on
his
pony
only
a
dot
in
the
distance
beyond
the
foliage
still
flashes
and
dominates
the
landscape
proud
mankind
there
you
ride
but
alas
most
of
the
men
are
still
ignominious
the
italians
look
curiously
rabbity
in
the
uniform
just
as
our
khaki
men
look
doggy
they
seem
to
scuffle
rather
abased
ignominious
on
the
earth
give
us
back
the
scarlet
and
gold
and
devil
take
the
hindmost
the
landscape
really
begins
to
change
the
hillsides
tilt
sharper
and
sharper
a
man
is
ploughing
with
two
small
red
cattle
on
a
craggy
slope
as
sharp
as
a
he
stoops
at
the
small
wooden
plough
and
jerks
the
ploughlines
the
oxen
lift
their
noses
to
heaven
with
a
strange
and
beseeching
movement
and
taking
tiny
little
steps
with
their
frail
feet
move
slantingly
across
the
between
rocks
and
little
frail
jerky
steps
the
bullocks
take
and
again
they
put
their
horns
back
and
lift
their
muzzles
snakily
to
heaven
as
the
man
pulls
the
line
and
he
skids
his
wooden
plough
round
another
scoop
of
earth
it
is
marvellous
how
they
hang
upon
that
steep
craggy
slope
an
english
labourer
eyes
would
bolt
out
of
his
head
at
the
sight
there
is
a
stream
actually
a
long
tress
of
a
pouring
into
a
little
gorge
and
a
that
opens
a
little
and
shows
a
marvellous
cluster
of
naked
poplars
away
below
they
are
like
ghosts
they
have
a
ghostly
almost
phosphorescent
luminousness
in
the
shadow
of
the
valley
by
the
stream
of
water
if
not
phosphorescent
then
incandescent
a
grey
incandescence
of
naked
limbs
and
myriad
twigs
gleaming
strangely
if
i
were
a
painter
i
would
paint
them
for
they
seem
to
have
living
sentient
flesh
and
the
shadow
envelopes
them
another
naked
tree
i
would
paint
is
the
gleaming
fig
which
burns
its
cold
incandescence
tangled
like
some
sensitive
creature
emerged
from
the
rock
a
fig
tree
come
forth
in
its
nudity
gleaming
over
the
dark
is
a
sight
to
behold
like
some
white
tangled
sea
anemone
ah
if
it
could
but
answer
or
if
we
had
yes
the
steep
valley
sides
become
almost
gorges
and
there
are
trees
not
forests
such
as
i
had
imagined
but
scattered
grey
smallish
oaks
and
some
lithe
chestnuts
chestnuts
with
their
long
whips
and
oaks
with
their
stubby
boughs
scattered
on
steep
hillsides
where
rocks
crop
out
the
train
perilously
winding
round
half
way
up
then
suddenly
bolting
over
a
bridge
and
into
a
completely
unexpected
station
what
is
more
men
crowd
in
the
station
is
connected
with
the
main
railway
by
a
post
an
unexpected
irruption
of
men
they
may
be
miners
or
navvies
or
they
all
have
huge
sacks
some
lovely
with
flowers
across
the
darkness
one
old
man
is
in
full
costume
but
very
dirty
and
coming
to
pieces
the
others
wear
the
tight
breeches
and
sleeved
waistcoats
some
have
the
sheepskin
tunic
and
all
wear
the
long
stocking
cap
and
how
they
smell
of
and
of
men
and
goat
a
rank
scent
fills
the
carriage
they
talk
and
are
very
lively
and
they
have
mediaeval
faces
never
really
abandoning
their
defences
for
a
moment
as
a
badger
or
a
never
abandons
its
defences
there
is
none
of
the
brotherliness
and
civilised
simplicity
each
man
knows
he
must
guard
himself
and
his
own
each
man
knows
the
devil
is
behind
the
next
bush
they
have
never
known
the
jesus
which
is
rather
an
not
that
they
are
suspicious
or
uneasy
on
the
contrary
noisy
assertive
vigorous
presences
but
with
none
of
that
implicit
belief
that
everybody
will
be
and
ought
to
be
good
to
them
which
is
the
mark
of
our
era
they
do
expect
people
to
be
good
to
them
they
do
want
it
they
remind
me
of
dogs
that
will
love
and
obey
but
which
wo
be
handled
they
wo
have
their
heads
touched
and
they
wo
be
fondled
one
can
almost
hear
the
growl
the
long
stocking
caps
they
wear
as
a
sort
of
crest
as
a
lizard
wears
his
crest
at
mating
time
they
are
always
moving
them
settling
them
on
their
heads
one
fat
fellow
young
with
sly
brown
eyes
and
a
young
beard
round
his
face
folds
his
in
three
so
that
it
rises
over
his
brow
martial
and
handsome
the
old
boy
brings
his
over
the
left
ear
a
handsome
fellow
with
a
jaw
of
massive
teeth
pushes
his
cap
back
and
lets
it
hang
a
long
way
down
his
back
then
he
shifts
it
forward
over
his
nose
and
makes
it
have
two
points
like
above
his
temples
it
is
marvellous
how
much
expression
these
caps
can
take
on
they
say
that
only
those
born
to
them
can
wear
them
they
seem
to
be
just
long
bags
nearly
a
yard
long
of
black
stockinette
stuff
the
conductor
comes
to
issue
them
their
tickets
and
they
all
take
out
rolls
of
paper
money
even
a
little
mothy
rat
of
a
man
who
sits
opposite
me
has
quite
a
pad
of
notes
nobody
seems
short
of
a
hundred
francs
nowadays
nobody
they
shout
and
expostulate
with
the
conductor
full
of
coarse
life
they
are
but
so
coarse
the
handsome
fellow
has
his
sleeved
waistcoat
open
and
his
has
come
unbuttoned
not
looking
it
seems
as
if
he
wears
a
black
undervest
then
suddenly
one
sees
it
is
his
own
hair
he
is
quite
black
inside
his
shirt
like
a
black
goat
but
there
is
a
gulf
between
oneself
and
them
they
have
no
inkling
of
our
crucifixion
our
universal
consciousness
each
of
them
is
pivoted
and
limited
to
himself
as
the
wild
animals
are
they
look
out
and
they
see
other
objects
objects
to
ridicule
or
mistrust
or
to
sniff
curiously
at
but
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
thyself
has
never
entered
their
souls
at
all
not
even
the
thin
end
of
it
they
might
love
their
neighbour
with
a
hot
dark
unquestioning
love
but
the
love
would
probably
leave
off
abruptly
the
fascination
of
what
is
beyond
them
has
not
seized
on
them
their
neighbour
is
a
mere
external
their
life
is
centripetal
pivoted
inside
itself
and
does
not
run
out
towards
others
and
mankind
one
feels
for
the
first
time
the
real
old
mediaeval
life
which
is
enclosed
in
itself
and
has
no
interest
in
the
world
outside
and
so
they
lie
about
on
the
seats
play
a
game
shout
and
sleep
and
settle
their
long
and
spit
it
is
wonderful
in
them
that
at
this
time
of
day
they
still
wear
the
long
as
part
of
their
inevitable
selves
it
is
a
sign
of
obstinate
and
powerful
tenacity
they
are
not
going
to
be
broken
in
upon
by
they
are
not
going
into
the
world
common
clothes
coarse
vigorous
determined
they
will
stick
to
their
own
coarse
dark
stupidity
and
let
the
big
world
find
its
own
way
to
its
own
enlightened
hell
their
hell
is
their
own
hell
they
prefer
it
unenlightened
and
one
can
not
help
wondering
whether
sardinia
will
resist
right
through
will
the
last
waves
of
enlightenment
and
break
over
them
and
wash
away
the
or
is
the
tide
of
enlightenment
and
already
receding
fast
enough
certainly
a
reaction
is
setting
in
away
from
the
old
universality
back
away
from
cosmopolitanism
and
internationalism
russia
with
her
third
international
is
at
the
same
time
reacting
most
violently
away
from
all
other
contact
back
recoiling
on
herself
into
a
fierce
unapproachable
russianism
which
motion
will
conquer
the
international
or
the
centripetal
movement
into
national
isolation
are
we
going
to
merge
into
one
grey
proletarian
homogeneity
or
are
we
going
to
swing
back
into
isolated
separate
defiant
communities
probably
both
the
workman
international
movement
will
finally
break
the
flow
towards
cosmopolitanism
and
and
suddenly
in
a
crash
the
world
will
fly
back
into
intense
separations
the
moment
has
come
when
america
that
extremist
in
and
is
reacting
into
violent
egocentricity
a
truly
amerindian
egocentricity
as
sure
as
fate
we
are
on
the
brink
of
american
empire
for
myself
i
am
glad
i
am
glad
that
the
era
of
love
and
oneness
is
over
hateful
homogeneous
i
am
glad
that
russia
flies
back
into
savage
russianism
scythism
savagely
i
am
glad
that
america
is
doing
the
same
i
shall
be
glad
when
men
hate
their
common
clothes
when
they
tear
them
up
and
clothe
themselves
fiercely
for
distinction
savage
distinction
savage
distinction
against
the
rest
of
the
creeping
world
when
america
kicks
the
and
the
into
limbo
and
takes
to
her
own
national
costume
when
men
fiercely
react
against
looking
all
alike
and
being
all
alike
and
betake
themselves
into
vivid
clan
or
the
era
of
love
and
oneness
is
over
the
era
of
should
be
at
an
end
the
other
tide
has
set
in
men
will
set
their
bonnets
at
one
another
now
and
fight
themselves
into
separation
and
sharp
distinction
the
day
of
peace
and
oneness
is
over
the
day
of
the
great
fight
into
multifariousness
is
at
hand
hasten
the
day
and
save
us
from
proletarian
homogeneity
and
khaki
i
love
my
indomitable
coarse
men
from
mountain
sardinia
for
their
and
their
splendid
stupidity
if
only
the
last
wave
of
wo
wash
those
superb
crests
those
caps
away
we
are
struggling
now
among
the
gennargentu
spurs
there
is
no
single
peak
no
etna
of
sardinia
the
train
like
the
plough
balances
on
the
steep
steep
sides
of
the
and
winds
around
and
around
above
and
below
the
steep
slopes
are
all
bosky
these
are
the
woods
of
gennargentu
but
they
are
woods
in
my
sense
of
the
word
they
are
thin
sprinkles
of
oaks
and
chestnuts
and
over
steep
and
i
see
curious
slim
trees
that
are
stripped
quite
naked
below
the
boughs
standing
curiously
distinct
among
the
bluey
grey
pallor
of
the
others
they
remind
me
again
and
again
of
glowing
naked
aborigines
of
the
south
seas
they
have
the
naked
suavity
and
an
intense
colour
of
unclothed
savages
and
these
are
the
stripped
some
are
much
stripped
some
little
some
have
the
whole
trunk
and
part
of
the
lower
limbs
ruddy
naked
some
only
a
small
part
of
the
trunk
it
is
well
on
in
the
afternoon
a
peasant
in
black
and
white
and
his
young
handsome
woman
in
costume
with
gorgeous
apron
bordered
deep
with
and
a
little
waistcoat
over
her
white
full
bodice
are
sitting
behind
me
talking
the
workmen
peasants
are
subsiding
into
sleep
it
is
well
on
in
the
afternoon
we
have
long
ago
eaten
the
meat
now
we
finish
the
white
loaf
the
gift
and
the
tea
suddenly
looking
out
of
the
window
we
see
gennargentu
mass
behind
us
a
thick
beautiful
beyond
the
long
steep
spurs
among
which
we
are
engaged
we
lose
the
white
mountain
mass
for
half
an
hour
when
suddenly
it
emerges
unexpectedly
almost
in
front
the
great
shoulder
how
different
it
is
from
etna
that
lonely
wonder
of
sicily
this
is
much
more
human
and
knowable
with
a
deep
breast
and
massive
limbs
a
powerful
it
is
like
the
peasants
the
stations
are
far
between
an
hour
from
one
to
another
ah
how
weary
one
gets
of
these
journeys
they
last
so
long
we
look
across
a
valley
a
stone
throw
but
alas
the
little
train
has
no
wings
and
ca
jump
so
back
turns
the
line
back
and
back
towards
gennargentu
a
long
rocky
way
till
it
comes
at
length
to
the
poor
this
it
skirts
fussily
and
sets
off
to
pelt
down
on
its
traces
again
gaily
and
a
man
who
was
looking
at
us
doing
our
has
climbed
down
and
crossed
the
valley
in
five
minutes
the
peasants
nearly
all
wear
costumes
now
even
the
women
in
the
fields
the
little
fields
in
the
valleys
these
gennargentu
valleys
are
all
more
than
the
moors
further
south
it
is
past
three
and
cold
where
there
is
no
sun
at
last
only
one
more
station
before
the
terminus
and
here
the
peasants
wake
up
sling
the
bulging
sacks
over
their
shoulders
and
get
down
we
see
tonara
away
above
we
see
our
old
grimy
peasant
greeted
by
his
two
women
who
have
come
to
meet
him
with
the
pony
daughters
handsome
in
vivid
rose
and
green
costume
peasants
men
in
black
and
white
men
in
with
the
close
breeches
on
their
compact
thighs
women
in
ponies
with
all
begin
to
trail
up
the
in
silhouette
very
handsome
towards
the
perched
village
of
tonara
a
big
village
shining
like
a
new
jerusalem
the
train
as
usual
leaves
us
standing
and
shuffles
with
trucks
water
sounds
in
the
valley
there
are
stacks
of
cork
on
the
station
and
coal
an
idiot
girl
in
a
great
full
skirt
entirely
made
of
coloured
patches
mops
and
mows
her
little
waistcoat
thing
is
also
incredibly
old
and
shows
faint
signs
of
having
once
been
a
lovely
purple
and
black
brocade
the
valley
and
steep
slopes
are
open
about
us
an
old
shepherd
has
a
lovely
flock
of
delicate
merino
sheep
and
at
last
we
move
in
one
hour
we
shall
be
there
as
we
travel
among
the
tree
slopes
many
brown
we
come
upon
a
flock
of
sheep
two
peasants
in
our
carriage
looking
out
give
the
most
weird
unnatural
shrieks
entirely
unproduceable
by
any
ordinary
being
the
sheep
know
however
and
scatter
and
after
ten
minutes
the
shrieks
start
again
for
three
young
cattle
whether
the
peasants
do
it
for
love
i
do
know
but
it
is
the
wildest
and
weirdest
inhuman
shepherd
noise
i
have
ever
heard
it
is
saturday
afternoon
and
four
the
country
is
wild
and
uninhabited
the
train
almost
empty
yet
there
is
the
feeling
in
the
atmosphere
oh
twisty
wooded
steep
slopes
oh
glimpses
of
gennargentu
oh
oh
smell
of
peasants
oh
wooden
wearisome
railway
carriage
we
are
so
sick
of
you
nearly
seven
hours
of
this
journey
already
and
a
distance
of
sixty
miles
but
we
are
almost
there
look
look
sorgono
nestling
beautifully
among
the
wooded
slopes
in
front
oh
magic
little
town
ah
you
terminus
and
ganglion
of
the
inland
roads
we
hope
in
you
for
a
pleasant
inn
and
happy
company
perhaps
we
will
stay
a
day
or
two
at
sorgono
the
train
gives
a
last
sigh
and
draws
to
a
last
standstill
in
the
tiny
terminus
station
an
old
fellow
fluttering
with
rags
as
a
hen
in
the
wind
flutters
asked
me
if
i
wanted
the
the
inn
i
said
yes
and
let
him
take
my
knapsack
pretty
sorgono
as
we
went
down
the
brief
muddy
lane
between
hedges
to
the
village
we
seemed
almost
to
have
come
to
some
little
town
in
the
english
or
in
country
there
were
glades
of
stripling
oaks
and
big
slopes
with
oak
trees
and
on
the
right
a
buzzing
and
on
the
left
the
town
white
and
close
nestling
round
a
baroque
and
the
little
lane
was
muddy
three
minutes
brought
us
to
the
and
a
great
building
blank
on
the
road
facing
the
station
lane
and
labelled
in
huge
letters
ristorante
risveglio
the
letter
n
being
printed
backwards
if
you
please
which
means
waking
up
or
rousing
like
the
word
into
the
doorway
of
the
risveglio
bolted
the
flutterer
half
a
minute
said
i
where
is
the
albergo
i
was
relying
on
baedeker
non
più
replied
my
there
is
it
any
more
this
answer
being
very
frequent
nowadays
is
always
most
disconcerting
well
then
what
other
hotel
there
is
no
other
risveglio
or
nothing
in
we
go
we
pass
into
a
big
dreary
bar
where
are
innumerable
bottles
behind
a
tin
counter
yells
and
at
length
appears
mine
host
a
youngish
fellow
of
the
esquimo
type
but
rather
bigger
in
a
dreary
black
suit
and
a
cutaway
waistcoat
suggesting
a
and
innumerable
on
his
shirt
front
i
instantly
hated
him
for
the
filthy
appearance
he
made
he
wore
a
battered
hat
and
his
face
was
long
unwashed
was
there
a
bedroom
yes
and
he
led
the
way
down
the
passage
just
as
dirty
as
the
road
outside
up
the
hollow
wooden
stairs
also
just
as
clean
as
the
passage
along
a
hollow
dirty
corridor
and
into
a
bedroom
well
it
contained
a
large
bed
thin
and
flat
with
a
counterpane
like
a
large
poor
tomb
in
the
room
sordid
emptiness
one
dilapidated
chair
on
which
stood
the
miserablest
weed
of
a
candle
i
have
ever
seen
a
broken
in
a
wire
ring
and
for
the
rest
an
expanse
of
wooden
floor
as
as
it
could
be
and
an
expanse
of
wall
charted
with
the
bloody
deaths
of
mosquitoes
the
window
was
about
two
feet
above
the
level
of
a
sort
of
outside
with
a
just
by
the
sash
there
at
the
window
flew
lousy
feathers
and
dirty
straw
the
ground
was
thick
with
an
ass
and
two
oxen
comfortably
chewed
hay
in
an
open
shed
just
across
and
plump
in
the
middle
of
the
yard
lay
a
bristly
black
pig
taking
the
last
of
the
sun
smells
of
course
were
varied
the
knapsack
and
the
kitchenino
were
dropped
on
the
repulsive
floor
which
i
hated
to
touch
with
my
boots
even
i
turned
back
the
sheets
and
looked
at
other
people
stains
there
is
nothing
else
niente
said
he
of
the
lank
low
forehead
and
beastly
and
he
sullenly
departed
i
gave
the
flutterer
his
tip
and
he
too
ducked
and
fled
then
the
and
i
took
a
few
mere
sniffs
dirty
disgusting
swine
said
i
and
i
was
in
a
rage
i
could
have
forgiven
him
anything
i
think
except
his
horrible
his
personal
shamelessness
we
strolled
round
saw
various
other
bedrooms
some
worse
one
really
better
but
this
showed
signs
of
being
occupied
all
the
doors
were
open
the
place
was
quite
deserted
and
open
to
the
road
the
one
thing
that
seemed
definite
was
honesty
it
must
be
a
very
honest
place
for
every
footed
beast
man
or
animal
could
walk
in
at
random
and
nobody
to
take
the
slightest
regard
so
we
went
downstairs
the
only
other
apartment
was
the
open
public
bar
which
seemed
like
part
of
the
road
a
muleteer
leaving
his
mules
at
the
corner
of
the
risveglio
was
drinking
at
the
counter
this
famous
inn
was
at
the
end
of
the
village
we
strolled
along
the
road
between
the
houses
a
dreary
hole
a
cold
hopeless
lifeless
saturday
village
rather
sordid
with
nothing
to
say
for
itself
no
real
shops
at
all
a
church
and
a
clutch
of
disconsolate
houses
we
walked
right
through
the
village
in
the
middle
was
a
sort
of
open
space
where
stood
a
great
grey
and
a
looking
rather
weary
where
did
the
bus
go
it
went
to
join
the
main
railway
when
at
seven
in
the
morning
only
then
only
then
thank
god
we
can
get
out
anyhow
said
i
we
passed
on
and
emerged
beyond
the
village
still
on
the
descending
great
that
was
mended
with
loose
stones
pitched
on
it
this
was
good
enough
besides
we
were
out
of
the
sun
and
the
place
being
at
a
considerable
elevation
it
was
very
cold
so
we
turned
back
to
climb
quickly
uphill
into
the
sun
we
went
up
a
little
past
a
bunch
of
poor
houses
towards
a
steep
little
lane
between
banks
and
before
we
knew
where
we
were
we
were
in
the
thick
of
the
public
lavatory
in
these
villages
as
i
knew
there
are
no
sanitary
arrangements
of
any
sort
whatever
every
villager
and
villageress
just
betook
himself
at
need
to
one
of
the
it
is
the
immemorial
italian
custom
why
bother
about
privacy
the
most
people
on
earth
they
even
like
to
relieve
themselves
in
company
we
found
ourselves
in
the
full
thick
of
one
of
these
to
get
out
at
any
price
so
we
scrambled
up
the
steep
earthen
banks
to
a
stubble
field
above
and
by
this
time
i
was
in
a
greater
rage
evening
was
falling
the
sun
declining
below
us
clustered
the
of
this
vile
village
around
were
fair
hills
and
dales
already
bluish
with
the
the
air
bit
cold
and
strong
in
a
very
little
time
the
sun
would
be
down
we
were
at
an
elevation
of
about
feet
above
the
sea
no
denying
it
was
beautiful
with
the
and
the
wistfulness
and
the
feeling
of
loneliness
and
evening
but
i
was
in
too
great
a
temper
to
admit
it
we
clambered
frenziedly
to
get
warm
and
the
sun
immediately
went
right
down
and
the
blue
shadow
fell
over
us
all
the
village
began
to
send
forth
blue
and
it
seemed
more
than
ever
like
the
twilit
west
country
but
thank
you
we
had
to
get
back
and
run
the
gauntlet
of
that
stinking
stinking
lane
never
towering
with
fury
quite
unreasonable
but
there
you
are
i
marched
the
down
a
declivity
through
a
wood
over
a
ploughed
field
along
a
and
so
to
the
great
above
the
village
and
above
the
inn
it
was
cold
and
evening
was
falling
into
dusk
down
the
came
wild
men
on
ponies
in
all
degrees
of
costume
and
came
four
cows
stepping
round
the
corner
and
three
delicate
beautiful
merino
sheep
which
stared
at
us
with
their
prominent
eyes
came
an
ancient
ancient
man
with
a
stick
came
a
peasant
carrying
a
long
came
a
straggle
of
alert
and
triumphant
goats
jingling
their
bells
everybody
greeted
us
hesitatingly
and
everything
came
to
a
halt
at
the
risveglio
corner
while
the
men
had
a
nip
i
attacked
the
again
could
i
have
milk
no
perhaps
in
an
hour
there
would
be
milk
perhaps
not
was
there
anything
to
eat
no
at
half
past
seven
there
would
be
something
to
eat
was
there
a
fire
no
the
man
had
made
the
fire
nothing
to
do
but
to
go
to
that
foul
bedroom
or
walk
the
we
turned
up
the
again
animals
stood
about
the
road
in
the
air
with
heads
sunk
passively
waiting
for
the
men
to
finish
their
drinks
in
the
beastly
bar
we
walked
slowly
up
the
hill
in
a
field
on
the
right
a
flock
of
merino
sheep
moved
mistily
uneasily
climbing
at
the
gaps
in
the
broken
road
bank
and
sounding
their
innumerable
small
fine
bells
with
a
frosty
ripple
of
sound
a
figure
which
in
the
dusk
i
had
really
thought
was
something
inanimate
broke
into
movement
in
the
field
it
was
an
old
shepherd
very
old
in
very
ragged
dirty
who
had
been
standing
like
a
stone
there
in
the
open
for
heaven
knows
how
long
utterly
motionless
leaning
on
his
stick
now
he
broke
into
a
and
hobbled
after
the
wistful
feminine
inquisitive
sheep
the
red
was
fading
from
the
west
at
the
corner
climbing
slowly
and
wearily
we
almost
ran
into
a
grey
and
lonely
bull
who
came
stepping
in
his
measured
fashion
like
some
god
he
swerved
his
head
and
went
round
us
we
reached
a
place
which
we
could
make
out
then
saw
it
was
a
there
were
stacks
and
stacks
of
in
the
dusk
like
crumpled
hides
now
i
going
back
said
the
flatly
and
she
swung
round
the
last
red
was
smouldering
beyond
the
lost
hills
of
this
interior
a
fleece
of
blue
smoke
floated
over
the
obscure
village
the
wound
at
our
feet
pale
and
blue
and
the
was
angry
with
me
for
my
fury
why
are
you
so
indignant
anyone
would
think
your
moral
self
had
been
outraged
why
take
it
morally
you
petrify
that
man
at
the
inn
by
the
very
way
you
speak
to
him
condemnation
why
do
you
take
it
as
it
comes
it
all
life
but
no
my
rage
is
black
black
black
why
heaven
knows
but
i
think
it
was
because
sorgono
had
seemed
so
fascinating
to
me
when
i
imagined
it
beforehand
oh
so
fascinating
if
i
had
expected
nothing
i
should
not
have
been
so
hit
blessed
is
he
that
expecteth
nothing
for
he
shall
not
be
disappointed
i
cursed
the
degenerate
aborigines
the
host
who
to
keep
such
an
inn
the
sordid
villagers
who
had
the
baseness
to
squat
their
beastly
human
nastiness
in
this
upland
valley
all
my
praise
of
the
long
you
remember
vanished
from
my
mouth
i
cursed
them
all
and
the
for
an
interfering
female
in
the
bar
a
wretched
candle
was
weeping
light
uneasy
gloomy
men
were
drinking
their
dram
cattle
lay
down
in
the
road
in
the
cold
air
as
if
hopeless
had
the
milk
come
no
when
would
it
come
he
did
know
well
what
were
we
to
do
was
there
no
room
was
there
nowhere
where
we
could
sit
yes
there
was
the
now
taking
the
only
weed
of
a
candle
and
leaving
the
drinkers
in
the
dark
he
led
us
down
a
dark
and
stumbly
earthen
passage
over
loose
stones
and
an
odd
plank
as
it
would
seem
underground
to
the
stanza
the
room
the
stanza
it
was
pitch
dark
but
suddenly
i
saw
a
big
fire
of
a
brilliant
flamy
rich
fire
and
my
rage
in
that
second
disappeared
the
host
and
the
candle
forsook
us
at
the
door
the
stanza
would
have
been
in
complete
darkness
save
for
that
rushing
bouquet
of
new
flames
in
the
chimney
like
fresh
flowers
by
this
firelight
we
saw
the
room
it
was
like
a
dungeon
absolutely
empty
with
an
uneven
earthen
floor
quite
dry
and
high
bare
walls
gloomy
with
a
handbreadth
of
window
high
up
there
was
no
furniture
at
all
save
a
little
wooden
bench
a
foot
high
before
the
fire
and
several
rush
mats
rolled
up
and
leaning
against
the
walls
furthermore
a
chair
before
the
fire
on
which
hung
wet
apart
from
this
it
was
a
high
dark
naked
but
it
was
quite
dry
it
had
an
open
chimney
and
a
gorgeous
new
fire
rushing
like
a
upwards
among
the
craggy
stubs
of
a
pile
of
dry
oak
roots
i
hastily
put
the
chair
and
the
wet
to
one
side
we
sat
on
the
low
bench
side
by
side
in
the
dark
in
front
of
this
rippling
rich
fire
in
front
of
the
cavern
of
the
open
chimney
and
we
did
not
care
any
more
about
the
dungeon
and
the
darkness
man
can
live
without
food
but
he
ca
live
without
fire
it
is
an
italian
proverb
we
had
found
the
fire
like
new
gold
and
we
sat
in
front
of
it
a
little
way
back
side
by
side
on
the
low
form
our
feet
on
the
uneven
earthen
floor
and
felt
the
rippling
upwards
over
our
faces
as
if
we
were
bathing
in
some
gorgeous
stream
of
fieriness
i
forgave
the
host
everything
and
was
as
glad
as
if
i
had
come
into
a
kingdom
so
we
sat
alone
for
half
an
hour
smiling
into
the
flames
bathing
our
faces
in
the
glow
from
time
to
time
i
was
aware
of
steps
in
the
passage
outside
and
of
presences
peering
but
no
one
came
i
was
aware
too
of
the
faint
steaming
of
the
beastly
the
only
other
occupants
of
the
room
in
dithers
a
candle
and
an
elderly
bearded
man
in
corduroys
and
an
amazing
object
on
a
long
long
spear
he
put
the
candle
on
the
and
crouched
at
the
side
of
the
fire
arranging
the
he
peered
strangely
and
fixedly
in
the
fire
and
he
held
up
the
speared
object
before
our
faces
it
was
a
kid
that
he
had
come
to
roast
but
it
was
a
kid
opened
out
made
quite
flat
and
speared
like
a
flat
fan
on
a
long
iron
stalk
it
was
a
really
curious
sight
and
it
must
have
taken
some
doing
the
whole
of
the
skinned
kid
was
there
the
head
curled
in
against
a
shoulder
the
stubby
cut
ears
the
eyes
the
teeth
the
few
hairs
of
the
nostrils
and
the
feet
curled
curiously
round
like
an
animal
that
puts
its
over
its
ducked
head
and
the
twisted
indescribably
up
and
all
skewered
upon
the
long
iron
rod
so
that
it
was
a
complete
flat
pattern
it
reminded
me
intensely
of
those
distorted
animals
which
figure
on
the
old
lombard
ornaments
distorted
and
curiously
infolded
upon
themselves
celtic
illuminations
also
have
these
distorted
involuted
creatures
the
old
man
flourished
the
flat
kid
like
a
bannerette
whilst
he
arranged
the
fire
then
in
one
side
of
the
wall
he
poked
the
point
of
the
rod
he
himself
crouched
on
the
in
the
at
the
other
side
of
the
holding
the
further
end
of
the
long
iron
rod
the
kid
was
thus
extended
before
the
fire
like
a
and
he
could
spin
it
round
at
will
illustration
sorongo
but
the
hole
in
the
masonry
of
the
was
not
satisfactory
the
point
of
the
rod
kept
slipping
and
the
kid
came
down
against
the
fire
he
muttered
and
muttered
to
himself
and
tried
again
then
at
length
he
reared
up
the
whilst
he
got
large
stones
from
a
dark
corner
he
arranged
these
stones
so
that
the
iron
point
rested
on
them
he
himself
sat
away
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
on
the
shadowy
and
with
queer
black
eyes
and
completely
immovable
face
he
watched
the
flames
and
the
kid
and
held
the
handle
end
of
the
rod
we
asked
him
if
the
kid
was
for
the
evening
meal
and
he
said
it
was
it
would
be
good
and
he
said
yes
and
looked
with
chagrin
at
the
bit
of
ash
on
the
meat
where
it
had
slipped
it
is
a
point
of
honour
that
it
should
never
touch
the
ash
did
they
do
all
their
meat
this
way
he
said
they
did
and
was
it
difficult
to
put
the
kid
thus
on
the
iron
rod
he
said
it
was
not
easy
and
he
eyed
the
joint
closely
and
felt
one
of
the
forelegs
and
muttered
that
was
not
fixed
properly
he
spoke
with
a
very
soft
mutter
hard
to
catch
and
sideways
never
to
us
direct
but
his
manner
was
gentle
soft
muttering
reticent
sensitive
he
asked
us
where
we
came
from
and
where
we
were
going
always
in
his
soft
mutter
and
what
nation
were
we
were
we
french
then
he
went
on
to
say
there
was
a
war
but
he
thought
it
was
finished
there
was
a
war
because
the
austrians
wanted
to
come
into
italy
again
but
the
french
and
the
english
came
to
help
italy
a
lot
of
sardinians
had
gone
to
it
but
let
us
hope
it
is
all
finished
he
thought
it
was
young
men
of
sorgono
had
been
killed
he
hoped
it
was
finished
then
he
reached
for
the
candle
and
peered
at
the
kid
it
was
evident
he
was
the
born
roaster
he
held
the
candle
and
looked
for
a
long
time
at
the
sizzling
side
of
the
meat
as
if
he
would
read
portents
then
he
held
his
spit
to
the
fire
again
and
it
was
as
if
time
immemorial
were
roasting
itself
another
meal
i
sat
holding
the
candle
a
young
woman
appeared
hearing
voices
her
head
was
swathed
in
a
shawl
one
side
of
which
was
brought
across
right
over
the
mouth
so
that
only
her
two
eyes
and
her
nose
showed
the
thought
she
must
have
toothache
but
she
laughed
and
said
no
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
is
the
way
a
is
worn
in
sardinia
even
by
both
sexes
it
is
something
like
the
folding
of
the
arab
burnoose
the
point
seems
to
be
that
the
mouth
and
chin
are
thickly
covered
also
the
ears
and
brow
leaving
only
the
nose
and
eyes
exposed
they
say
it
keeps
off
the
malaria
the
men
swathe
shawls
round
their
heads
in
the
same
way
it
seems
to
me
they
want
to
keep
their
heads
warm
dark
and
hidden
they
feel
secure
inside
she
wore
the
workaday
costume
a
full
skirt
the
full
white
bodice
and
a
little
waistcoat
or
corset
this
little
waistcoat
in
her
case
had
become
no
more
than
a
shaped
belt
sending
up
graceful
stiffened
points
under
the
breasts
like
long
leaves
standing
up
it
was
pretty
but
all
dirty
she
too
was
pretty
but
with
an
impudent
not
quite
pleasant
manner
she
fiddled
with
the
wet
napkins
asked
us
various
questions
and
addressed
herself
rather
jerkily
to
the
old
man
who
answered
hardly
at
all
then
she
departed
again
the
women
are
in
a
rather
smirky
way
bouncy
when
she
was
gone
i
asked
the
old
man
if
she
was
his
daughter
he
said
very
brusquely
in
his
soft
mutter
no
she
came
from
a
village
some
miles
away
he
did
not
belong
to
the
inn
he
was
as
far
as
i
understood
the
postman
but
i
may
have
been
mistaken
about
the
word
but
he
seemed
laconic
unwilling
to
speak
about
the
inn
and
its
keepers
there
seemed
to
be
something
queer
and
again
he
asked
where
we
were
going
he
told
me
there
were
now
two
a
new
one
which
ran
over
the
mountains
to
nuoro
much
better
go
to
nuoro
than
to
abbasanta
nuoro
was
evidently
the
town
towards
which
these
villages
looked
as
a
sort
of
capital
the
proceeded
very
slowly
the
meat
never
being
very
near
the
fire
from
time
to
time
the
roaster
arranged
the
cavern
of
roots
then
he
threw
on
more
roots
it
was
very
hot
and
he
turned
the
long
spit
and
still
i
held
the
candle
other
people
came
strolling
in
to
look
at
us
but
they
hovered
behind
us
in
the
dark
so
i
could
not
make
out
at
all
clearly
they
strolled
in
the
gloom
of
the
room
and
watched
us
one
came
forward
a
fat
fat
young
soldier
in
uniform
i
made
place
for
him
on
the
bench
but
he
put
out
his
hand
and
disclaimed
the
attention
then
he
went
away
again
the
old
man
propped
up
the
roast
and
then
he
too
disappeared
for
a
time
the
thin
candle
guttered
the
fire
was
no
longer
flamy
but
red
the
roaster
reappeared
with
a
new
shorter
spear
thinner
and
a
great
lump
of
raw
spitted
on
it
this
he
thrust
into
the
red
fire
it
sizzled
and
smoked
and
spit
fat
and
i
wondered
he
told
me
he
wanted
it
to
catch
fire
it
refused
he
groped
in
the
hearth
for
the
bits
of
twigs
with
which
the
fire
had
been
started
these
he
stuck
in
the
fat
like
an
orange
stuck
with
cloves
then
he
held
it
in
the
fire
again
now
at
last
it
caught
and
it
was
a
flaming
torch
running
downwards
with
a
thin
shower
of
flaming
fat
and
now
he
was
satisfied
he
held
the
with
its
yellow
flares
over
the
browning
kid
which
he
turned
horizontal
for
the
occasion
all
over
the
roast
fell
the
flaming
drops
till
the
meat
was
all
shiny
and
browny
he
put
it
to
the
fire
again
holding
the
diminishing
fat
still
burning
bluish
over
it
all
the
time
in
the
upper
air
while
this
was
in
process
a
man
entered
with
a
loud
we
replied
and
evidently
he
caught
a
strange
note
he
came
and
bent
down
and
peered
under
my
then
under
the
we
still
wore
hats
and
overcoats
as
did
everybody
then
he
stood
up
suddenly
and
touched
his
cap
and
said
excuse
me
i
said
which
one
always
says
and
he
addressed
a
few
jovial
words
to
the
crouching
roaster
who
again
would
hardly
answer
him
the
omnibus
was
arrived
from
oristano
i
made
out
with
few
passengers
this
man
brought
with
him
a
new
breezy
atmosphere
which
the
roaster
did
not
like
however
i
made
place
on
the
low
bench
and
the
attention
this
time
was
accepted
sitting
down
at
the
extreme
end
he
came
into
the
light
and
i
saw
a
burly
man
in
the
prime
of
life
dressed
in
dark
brown
velvet
with
a
blond
little
moustache
and
twinkling
blue
eyes
and
a
tipsy
look
i
thought
he
might
be
some
local
tradesman
or
farmer
he
asked
a
few
questions
in
a
boisterous
familiar
fashion
then
went
out
again
he
appeared
with
a
small
iron
spit
a
slim
rod
in
one
hand
and
in
the
other
hand
two
joints
of
kid
and
a
handful
of
sausages
he
stuck
his
joints
on
his
rod
but
our
roaster
still
held
the
interminable
flat
kid
before
the
now
red
flameless
fire
the
was
burnt
out
the
cinder
pushed
in
the
fire
a
moment
spurt
of
flame
then
red
intense
redness
again
and
our
kid
before
it
like
a
big
dark
hand
eh
said
the
newcomer
whom
i
will
call
the
girovago
it
done
the
kid
done
it
done
the
roaster
slowly
shook
his
head
but
did
not
answer
he
sat
like
time
and
eternity
at
the
his
face
his
dark
eyes
still
still
sacredly
intent
on
the
roast
said
the
girovago
let
another
body
see
the
fire
and
with
his
pieces
of
meat
awkwardly
skewered
on
his
iron
stick
he
tried
to
poke
under
the
authorised
kid
and
get
at
the
fire
in
his
soft
mutter
the
old
man
bade
him
wait
for
the
fire
till
the
fire
was
ready
for
him
but
the
girovago
poked
impudently
and
good
humouredly
and
said
testily
that
the
authorised
kid
was
done
yes
surely
it
is
done
said
i
for
it
was
already
a
quarter
to
eight
the
old
roasting
priest
muttered
and
took
out
his
knife
from
his
pocket
he
pressed
the
blade
slowly
slowly
deep
into
the
meat
as
far
as
a
knife
will
go
in
a
piece
of
kid
he
seemed
to
be
feeling
the
meat
inwardly
and
he
said
it
was
not
done
he
shook
his
head
and
remained
there
like
time
and
eternity
at
the
end
of
the
rod
the
girovago
said
di
but
could
roast
his
meat
and
he
tried
to
poke
his
skewer
near
the
coals
so
doing
his
pieces
fell
off
into
the
ashes
and
the
invisible
onlookers
behind
raised
a
shout
of
laughter
however
he
raked
it
out
and
wiped
it
with
his
hand
and
said
no
matter
nothing
lost
then
he
turned
to
me
and
asked
the
usual
whence
and
whither
questions
these
answered
he
said
was
i
german
i
said
no
i
was
english
he
looked
at
me
many
times
shrewdly
as
if
he
wanted
to
make
out
something
then
he
asked
where
were
we
domiciled
and
i
said
sicily
and
then
very
pertinently
why
had
we
come
to
sardinia
i
said
for
pleasure
and
to
see
the
island
ah
per
divertimento
he
repeated
not
believing
me
in
the
least
various
men
had
now
come
into
the
room
though
they
all
remained
indistinct
in
the
background
the
girovago
talked
and
jested
abroad
in
the
company
and
the
men
laughed
in
a
rather
hostile
manner
at
last
the
old
roaster
decided
the
kid
was
done
he
lifted
it
from
the
fire
and
scrutinised
it
thoroughly
holding
the
candle
to
it
as
if
it
were
some
wonderful
epistle
from
the
flames
to
be
sure
it
looked
marvellous
and
smelled
so
good
brown
and
crisp
and
hot
and
savoury
not
burnt
in
any
place
whatever
it
was
eight
it
done
it
done
go
away
with
it
go
said
the
girovago
pushing
the
old
roaster
with
his
hand
and
at
last
the
old
man
consented
to
depart
holding
the
kid
like
a
banner
it
looks
so
cried
the
and
i
am
so
hungry
it
makes
one
hungry
to
see
good
meat
signora
now
it
is
my
turn
heh
gino
the
girovago
flourished
his
arm
and
a
handsome
unwashed
man
with
a
black
moustache
came
forward
rather
sheepishly
he
was
dressed
in
soldier
clothes
neutral
grey
and
was
a
big
robust
handsome
fellow
with
dark
eyes
and
mediterranean
sheepishness
here
take
it
thou
said
the
girovago
pressing
the
long
spit
into
his
hand
it
is
thy
business
cook
the
supper
thou
art
the
but
i
keep
the
sausages
and
do
them
the
woman
sat
at
the
end
of
the
hearth
where
the
old
roaster
had
sat
and
with
his
brown
nervous
hand
piled
the
remaining
coals
together
the
fire
was
no
longer
flamy
and
it
was
sinking
the
man
arranged
it
so
that
he
could
cook
the
meat
he
held
the
spit
negligently
over
the
red
mass
a
joint
fell
off
the
men
laughed
it
lost
nothing
said
the
man
as
the
girovago
had
said
before
and
he
skewered
it
on
again
and
thrust
it
to
the
fire
but
meanwhile
he
was
looking
up
from
under
his
dark
lashes
at
the
girovago
and
at
us
the
girovago
talked
continually
he
turned
to
me
holding
the
handful
of
sausages
this
makes
the
tasty
bit
he
said
oh
yes
good
salsiccia
said
i
you
are
eating
the
kid
you
are
eating
at
the
inn
he
said
i
replied
that
i
was
no
he
said
you
stay
and
eat
with
me
you
eat
with
me
the
sausage
is
good
the
kid
will
soon
be
done
the
fire
is
grateful
i
laughed
not
quite
understanding
him
he
was
certainly
a
bit
tipsy
signora
he
said
turning
to
the
she
did
not
like
him
he
was
impudent
and
she
shut
a
deaf
ear
to
him
as
far
as
she
could
signora
he
said
do
you
understand
me
what
i
say
she
replied
that
she
did
signora
he
said
i
sell
things
to
the
women
i
sell
them
things
what
do
you
sell
she
asked
in
astonishment
saints
he
said
saints
she
cried
in
more
astonishment
yes
saints
he
said
with
tipsy
gravity
she
turned
in
confusion
to
the
company
in
the
background
the
fat
soldier
came
forward
he
was
the
chief
of
the
carabinieri
also
combs
and
bits
of
soap
and
little
mirrors
he
explained
sarcastically
saints
said
the
girovago
once
more
and
also
also
youngsters
wherever
i
go
there
is
a
little
one
comes
running
calling
babbo
babbo
daddy
daddy
wherever
i
go
youngsters
and
i
the
babbo
all
this
was
received
with
a
kind
of
silent
sneer
from
the
invisible
assembly
in
the
background
the
candle
was
burning
low
the
fire
was
sinking
too
in
vain
the
man
tried
to
build
it
up
the
became
impatient
for
the
food
she
got
up
wrathfully
and
stumbled
into
the
dark
passage
exclaiming
do
we
eat
yet
eh
patience
patience
signora
it
takes
time
in
this
house
said
the
man
in
the
background
the
man
looked
up
at
the
girovago
and
said
are
you
going
to
cook
the
sausages
with
your
fingers
he
too
was
trying
to
be
assertive
and
jesting
but
he
was
the
kind
of
person
no
one
takes
any
notice
of
the
girovago
rattled
on
in
dialect
poking
fun
at
us
and
at
our
being
there
in
this
inn
i
did
not
quite
follow
signora
said
the
girovago
do
you
understand
sardinian
i
understand
italian
and
some
sardinian
she
replied
rather
hotly
and
i
know
that
you
are
trying
to
laugh
at
us
to
make
fun
of
us
he
laughed
fatly
and
comfortably
ah
signora
he
said
we
have
a
language
that
you
understand
not
one
word
nobody
here
would
understand
it
but
me
and
him
he
pointed
to
the
one
everybody
would
want
an
interpreter
everybody
but
he
did
not
say
interpreter
he
said
with
the
accent
on
the
penultimate
as
if
it
were
some
sort
of
priest
a
what
said
i
he
repeated
with
tipsy
unction
and
i
saw
what
he
meant
why
said
i
is
it
a
dialect
what
is
your
dialect
my
dialect
he
said
is
sassari
i
come
from
sassari
if
i
spoke
my
dialect
they
would
understand
something
but
if
i
speak
this
language
they
would
want
an
interpreter
what
language
is
it
then
he
leaned
up
to
me
laughing
it
is
the
language
we
use
when
the
women
are
buying
things
and
we
want
them
to
know
what
we
say
me
and
him
oh
said
i
i
know
we
have
that
language
in
england
it
is
called
thieves
latin
dei
the
men
at
the
back
suddenly
laughed
glad
to
turn
the
joke
against
the
forward
girovago
he
looked
down
his
nose
at
me
but
seeing
i
was
laughing
without
malice
he
leaned
to
me
and
said
softly
secretly
what
is
your
affair
then
what
affair
is
it
yours
how
what
i
exclaimed
not
understanding
genere
di
affari
what
sort
of
business
how
said
i
still
not
grasping
what
do
you
he
said
flatly
and
rather
spitefully
what
goods
i
do
sell
anything
replied
i
laughing
to
think
he
took
us
for
some
sort
of
strolling
quacks
or
commercial
travellers
cloth
or
something
he
said
cajolingly
slyly
as
if
to
worm
my
secret
out
of
me
but
nothing
at
all
nothing
at
all
said
i
we
have
come
to
sardinia
to
see
the
peasant
costumes
i
thought
that
might
sound
satisfactory
ah
the
costumes
he
said
evidently
thinking
i
was
a
deep
one
and
he
turned
bandying
words
with
his
mate
who
was
still
poking
the
meat
at
the
embers
and
crouching
on
the
hearth
the
room
was
almost
quite
dark
the
mate
answered
him
back
and
tried
to
seem
witty
too
but
the
girovago
was
the
commanding
personality
rather
too
much
so
too
impudent
for
the
though
rather
after
my
own
secret
heart
the
mate
was
one
of
those
handsome
passive
stupid
men
him
said
the
girovago
turning
suddenly
to
me
and
pointing
at
the
mate
he
my
wife
your
wife
said
i
yes
he
my
wife
because
we
always
together
there
had
become
a
sudden
dead
silence
in
the
background
in
spite
of
it
the
mate
looked
up
under
his
black
lashes
and
said
with
a
half
smile
do
talk
or
i
shall
give
thee
a
good
there
was
an
instant
fatal
pause
then
the
girovago
continued
tomorrow
is
festa
of
sant
at
tonara
tomorrow
we
are
going
to
tonara
where
are
you
going
to
abbasanta
said
i
ah
abbasanta
you
should
come
to
tonara
at
tonara
there
is
a
brisk
trade
and
there
are
costumes
you
should
come
to
tonara
come
with
him
and
me
to
tonara
tomorrow
and
we
will
do
business
together
i
laughed
but
did
not
answer
come
said
he
you
will
like
tonara
ah
tonara
is
a
fine
place
there
is
an
inn
you
can
eat
well
sleep
well
i
tell
you
because
to
you
ten
francs
do
matter
is
that
so
ten
francs
do
matter
to
you
well
then
come
to
tonara
what
what
do
you
say
i
shook
my
head
and
laughed
but
did
not
answer
to
tell
the
truth
i
should
have
liked
to
go
to
tonara
with
him
and
his
mate
and
do
the
brisk
trade
if
only
i
knew
what
trade
it
would
be
you
are
sleeping
upstairs
he
said
to
me
i
nodded
this
is
my
bed
he
said
taking
one
of
the
rush
mats
from
against
the
wall
i
did
not
take
him
seriously
at
any
point
do
they
make
those
in
sorgono
i
said
yes
in
sorgono
they
are
the
beds
you
see
and
you
roll
up
this
end
a
bit
so
and
that
is
the
pillow
he
laid
his
cheek
sideways
not
really
said
i
he
came
and
sat
down
again
next
to
me
and
my
attention
wandered
the
was
raging
for
her
dinner
it
must
be
quite
eight
the
kid
the
perfect
kid
would
be
cold
and
ruined
both
fire
and
candle
were
burning
low
someone
had
been
out
for
a
new
candle
but
there
was
evidently
no
means
of
replenishing
the
fire
the
mate
still
crouched
on
the
hearth
the
dull
red
on
his
handsome
face
patiently
trying
to
roast
the
kid
and
poking
it
against
the
embers
he
had
heavy
strong
limbs
in
his
khaki
clothes
but
his
hand
that
held
the
spit
was
brown
and
tender
and
sensitive
a
real
mediterranean
hand
the
girovago
blond
mature
and
aggressive
with
all
his
liveliness
was
more
like
a
northerner
in
the
background
were
four
or
five
other
men
of
whom
i
had
distinguished
none
but
a
stout
soldier
probably
chief
carabiniere
just
as
the
was
working
up
to
the
rage
i
had
at
last
calmed
down
from
appeared
the
girl
announcing
pronto
pronto
pronto
said
everybody
high
time
too
said
the
springing
from
the
low
bench
before
the
fire
where
do
we
eat
is
there
another
room
there
is
another
room
signora
said
the
carabiniere
so
we
trooped
out
of
the
dungeon
leaving
the
girovago
and
his
mate
and
two
other
men
muleteers
from
the
road
behind
us
i
could
see
that
it
irked
my
girovago
to
be
left
behind
he
was
by
far
the
strongest
personality
in
the
place
and
he
had
the
keenest
intelligence
so
he
hated
having
to
fall
into
the
background
when
he
had
been
dragging
all
the
on
to
himself
all
the
evening
to
me
too
he
was
something
of
a
kindred
soul
that
night
but
there
we
are
fate
in
the
guise
of
that
mysterious
division
between
a
respectable
life
and
a
scamp
life
divided
us
there
was
a
gulf
between
me
and
him
between
my
way
and
his
he
was
a
kindred
spirit
but
with
a
hopeless
difference
there
was
something
a
bit
sordid
about
him
and
he
knew
it
that
is
why
he
was
always
tipsy
yet
i
like
the
lone
wolf
souls
best
better
than
the
sheep
if
only
they
did
feel
mongrel
inside
themselves
presumably
a
scamp
is
bound
to
be
mongrel
it
is
a
pity
the
untamable
souls
should
always
become
pariahs
almost
of
choice
mere
scamps
top
and
bottom
of
it
is
i
regretted
my
girovago
though
i
knew
it
was
no
good
thinking
of
him
his
way
was
my
way
yet
i
regretted
him
i
did
we
found
ourselves
in
a
dining
room
with
a
long
white
table
and
inverted
lighted
by
an
acetylene
flare
three
men
had
accompanied
us
the
carabiniere
a
little
dark
youth
with
a
small
black
moustache
in
a
soldier
short
and
a
young
man
who
looked
tired
round
his
blue
eyes
and
who
wore
a
overcoat
quite
smart
the
damsel
came
in
with
the
inevitable
bowl
of
minestrone
soup
with
cabbage
and
cauliflower
and
other
things
we
helped
ourselves
and
the
fat
carabiniere
started
the
conversation
with
the
usual
questions
and
where
were
we
going
tomorrow
i
asked
about
buses
then
the
youth
told
me
he
was
the
he
had
come
from
oristano
on
the
main
line
that
day
it
is
a
distance
of
some
forty
miles
next
morning
he
was
going
on
over
the
mountains
to
nuoro
about
the
same
distance
again
the
youth
with
the
little
black
moustache
and
the
greek
large
eyes
was
his
mate
the
conductor
this
was
their
run
from
oristano
to
nuoro
a
course
of
ninety
miles
or
more
and
every
day
on
on
on
no
wonder
he
looked
yet
he
had
that
kind
of
dignity
the
wistful
seriousness
and
pride
of
a
man
in
machine
control
the
only
ones
today
those
who
pull
the
iron
levers
and
are
the
gods
in
the
machine
they
repeated
what
the
old
roaster
said
much
nicer
for
us
to
go
to
nuoro
than
to
abbasanta
so
to
nuoro
we
decided
to
go
leaving
at
nine
in
the
morning
every
other
night
the
driver
and
his
mate
spent
in
this
benighted
risveglio
inn
it
must
have
been
their
bedroom
we
saw
clean
and
tidy
i
said
was
the
food
always
so
late
was
everything
always
as
bad
as
today
always
if
not
worse
they
said
making
light
of
it
with
sarcastic
humor
against
the
risveglio
you
spent
your
whole
life
at
the
risveglio
sitting
waiting
and
going
unless
you
were
content
to
drink
like
those
in
there
the
driver
jerked
his
head
towards
the
dungeon
who
were
those
in
there
said
i
the
one
who
did
all
the
talking
was
a
mercante
a
mercante
girovago
a
wandering
peddler
this
was
my
girovago
a
wandering
peddler
selling
saints
and
youngsters
the
other
was
his
mate
who
helped
carry
the
pack
they
went
about
together
oh
my
girovago
was
a
known
figure
all
over
the
and
where
would
they
sleep
there
in
the
room
where
the
fire
was
dying
they
would
unroll
the
mats
and
lie
with
their
feet
to
the
hearth
for
this
they
paid
threepence
or
at
most
fourpence
and
they
had
the
privilege
of
cooking
their
own
food
the
risveglio
supplied
them
with
nothing
but
the
fire
the
roof
and
the
rush
and
of
course
the
drink
oh
we
need
have
no
sympathy
with
the
girovago
and
his
sort
lacked
for
nothing
they
had
everything
they
wanted
everything
and
money
in
abundance
lived
for
the
they
drank
that
was
all
they
wanted
their
continual
allowance
of
and
they
got
it
ah
they
were
not
cold
if
the
room
became
cold
during
the
night
if
they
had
no
coverings
at
all
pah
they
waited
for
morning
and
as
soon
as
it
was
light
they
drank
a
large
glass
of
that
was
their
fire
their
hearth
and
their
home
drink
was
hearth
and
home
to
them
i
was
surprised
at
the
contempt
tolerant
and
yet
profound
with
which
these
three
men
in
the
spoke
of
the
others
in
the
how
contemptuous
almost
bitter
the
driver
was
against
alcohol
it
was
evident
he
hated
it
and
though
we
all
had
our
bottles
of
dark
wine
and
though
we
all
drank
still
the
feeling
of
the
three
youths
against
actual
intoxication
was
deep
and
hostile
with
a
certain
burning
dislike
that
is
more
northern
than
italian
and
they
curled
their
lip
with
real
dislike
of
the
girovago
his
forwardness
his
impudent
aggressiveness
as
for
the
inn
yes
it
was
very
bad
it
had
been
quite
good
under
the
previous
proprietors
but
now
they
shrugged
their
shoulders
the
and
the
shawled
girl
were
not
the
owners
they
were
merely
conductors
of
the
hotel
here
a
sarcastic
curl
of
the
lip
the
owner
was
a
man
in
the
village
a
young
man
a
week
or
two
back
at
christmas
time
there
had
been
a
roomful
of
men
sitting
drinking
and
roistering
at
this
very
table
when
in
had
come
the
proprietor
swinging
a
litre
bottle
round
his
head
and
yelling
out
out
out
all
of
you
out
every
one
of
you
i
am
proprietor
here
and
when
i
want
to
clear
my
house
i
clear
my
house
every
man
obeys
who
does
obey
has
his
brains
knocked
out
with
this
bottle
out
out
i
say
out
everyone
and
the
men
all
cleared
out
but
said
the
i
told
him
that
when
i
had
paid
for
my
bed
i
was
going
to
sleep
in
it
i
was
not
going
to
be
turned
out
by
him
or
anybody
and
so
he
came
down
there
was
a
little
silence
from
everybody
after
this
story
evidently
there
was
more
to
it
that
we
were
not
to
be
told
especially
the
carabiniere
was
silent
he
was
a
fat
not
very
brave
fellow
though
quite
nice
ah
but
said
the
little
dark
with
his
swarthy
greek
face
you
must
not
be
angry
with
them
true
the
inn
was
very
bad
very
bad
but
you
must
pity
them
for
they
are
only
ignorant
poor
things
they
are
why
be
angry
the
other
two
men
nodded
their
heads
in
agreement
and
repeated
they
are
it
is
true
why
be
angry
and
here
the
modern
italian
spirit
came
out
the
endless
pity
for
the
ignorant
it
is
only
slackness
the
pity
makes
the
ignorant
more
ignorant
and
makes
the
risveglio
daily
more
impossible
if
somebody
let
a
bottle
buzz
round
the
ears
of
the
and
whipped
the
shawl
from
the
head
of
the
pert
young
madam
and
sent
her
flying
down
the
tunnel
with
a
flea
in
her
ear
we
might
get
some
attention
and
they
might
find
a
little
but
no
pity
them
poor
while
they
pull
life
down
and
devour
it
like
vermin
pity
them
what
they
need
is
not
pity
but
prods
they
and
all
their
myriad
of
likes
the
appeared
with
a
dish
of
kid
needless
to
say
the
had
kept
all
the
best
portions
for
themselves
what
arrived
was
five
pieces
of
cold
roast
one
for
each
of
us
mine
was
a
sort
of
large
comb
of
ribs
with
a
thin
web
of
meat
perhaps
an
ounce
that
was
all
we
got
after
watching
the
whole
process
there
was
moreover
a
dish
of
strong
boiled
cauliflower
which
one
ate
with
the
coarse
bread
out
of
sheer
hunger
after
this
a
bilious
orange
simply
one
is
not
nowadays
in
the
good
hotels
and
in
the
bad
one
is
given
paltry
portions
of
unnourishing
food
and
one
goes
unfed
the
the
only
one
with
an
earnest
soul
was
talking
of
the
sardinians
ah
the
sardinians
they
were
hopeless
why
because
they
did
not
know
how
to
strike
they
too
were
but
this
form
of
ignorance
he
found
more
annoying
they
simply
did
not
know
what
a
strike
was
if
you
offered
them
one
day
ten
francs
a
stint
he
was
speaking
now
of
the
miners
of
the
iglesias
no
no
no
they
would
not
take
it
they
wanted
twelve
francs
go
to
them
the
next
day
and
offer
them
four
francs
for
half
a
stint
and
yes
yes
yes
they
would
take
it
and
there
they
were
ignorant
ignorant
sardinians
they
absolutely
did
not
know
how
to
strike
he
was
quite
sarcastically
hot
about
it
the
whole
tone
of
these
three
young
men
was
the
tone
of
sceptical
irony
common
to
the
young
people
of
our
day
the
world
over
only
they
had
or
at
least
the
driver
had
some
little
fervour
for
his
strikes
and
his
socialism
but
it
was
a
pathetic
fervour
a
fervour
we
talked
about
the
land
the
war
has
practically
gutted
sardinia
of
her
cattle
so
they
said
and
now
the
land
is
being
deserted
the
arable
land
is
going
back
to
fallow
why
why
says
the
driver
because
the
owners
of
the
land
wo
spend
any
capital
they
have
got
the
capital
locked
up
and
the
land
is
dead
they
find
it
cheaper
to
let
all
the
arable
go
back
to
fallow
and
raise
a
few
head
of
cattle
rather
than
to
pay
high
wages
grow
corn
and
get
small
returns
yes
and
also
chimes
in
the
carabiniere
the
peasants
do
want
to
work
the
land
they
hate
the
land
they
do
anything
to
get
off
the
land
they
want
regular
wages
short
hours
and
devil
take
the
rest
so
they
will
go
into
france
as
navvies
by
the
hundred
they
flock
to
rome
they
besiege
the
labor
bureaus
they
will
do
the
artificial
government
at
a
miserable
five
francs
a
day
a
railway
shunter
having
at
least
eighteen
francs
a
day
anything
anything
rather
than
work
the
land
yes
and
what
does
the
government
do
replies
the
they
pull
the
roads
to
pieces
in
order
to
find
work
for
the
unemployed
remaking
them
across
the
campagna
but
in
sardinia
where
roads
and
bridges
are
absolutely
wanting
will
they
do
anything
no
there
it
is
however
the
with
dark
shadows
under
his
eyes
represents
the
intelligent
portion
of
the
conversation
the
carabiniere
is
soft
and
will
go
any
way
though
always
with
some
interest
the
little
conductor
just
does
not
care
enters
another
belated
traveller
and
takes
a
seat
at
the
end
of
the
table
the
brings
him
soup
and
a
skinny
bit
of
kid
he
eyes
this
last
with
contempt
and
fetches
out
of
his
bag
a
large
hunk
of
roast
pork
and
bread
and
black
olives
thus
proceeding
to
make
a
proper
meal
illustration
fonni
we
being
without
cigarettes
the
and
his
companion
press
them
on
us
their
beloved
macedonia
cigarettes
the
driver
says
they
are
most
most
exquisite
so
exquisite
that
all
foreigners
want
them
in
truth
i
believe
they
are
exported
to
germany
now
and
they
are
quite
good
when
they
really
have
tobacco
in
them
usually
they
are
hollow
tubes
of
paper
which
just
flare
away
under
one
nose
and
are
done
we
decide
to
have
a
round
drink
they
choose
the
precious
the
white
sort
i
think
at
last
it
arrives
when
the
little
one
has
fetched
it
and
it
tastes
rather
like
sweetened
petroleum
with
a
dash
of
aniseed
filthy
most
italian
liquors
are
now
sweet
and
filthy
at
length
we
rise
to
go
to
bed
we
shall
all
meet
in
the
morning
and
this
room
is
dead
cold
with
frost
outside
going
out
we
glance
into
the
famous
stanza
one
figure
alone
lies
stretched
on
the
floor
in
the
almost
complete
darkness
a
few
embers
still
glow
the
other
men
no
doubt
are
in
the
bar
ah
the
filthy
bedroom
the
ties
up
her
head
in
a
large
clean
white
kerchief
to
avoid
contact
with
the
unsavory
pillow
it
is
a
cold
hard
flat
bed
with
two
cold
hard
flat
blankets
but
we
are
very
tired
just
as
we
are
going
to
sleep
however
weird
singing
starts
below
very
uncanny
with
a
refrain
that
is
a
almost
like
a
dog
in
angry
pain
weird
almost
gruesome
this
singing
goes
on
first
one
voice
and
then
another
and
then
a
tangle
of
voices
again
we
are
roused
by
the
pounding
of
heavy
feet
on
the
corridor
outside
which
is
as
hollow
and
resonant
as
a
drum
and
then
in
the
infernal
outside
a
cock
crows
throughout
the
night
yea
through
all
the
black
and
frosty
hours
this
demoniac
bird
screams
its
demon
griefs
however
it
is
morning
i
gingerly
wash
a
bit
of
myself
in
the
broken
basin
and
dry
that
bit
on
a
muslin
veil
which
masquerades
upon
the
chair
as
a
towel
the
contents
herself
with
a
dry
wipe
and
we
go
downstairs
in
hopes
of
the
milk
there
is
no
one
to
be
seen
it
is
a
cold
clear
morning
there
is
no
one
in
the
bar
we
stumble
down
the
dark
tunnel
passage
the
stanza
is
as
if
no
man
had
ever
set
foot
in
it
very
dark
the
mats
against
the
wall
the
grey
with
a
handful
of
long
dead
ash
just
like
a
dungeon
the
has
the
same
long
table
and
eternal
and
our
serviettes
still
wet
lying
where
we
shovelled
them
aside
so
back
again
to
the
bar
and
this
time
a
man
is
drinking
and
the
is
officiating
he
has
no
hat
on
and
extraordinary
he
has
no
brow
at
all
just
flat
straight
black
hair
slanting
to
his
eyebrows
no
forehead
at
all
is
there
coffee
no
there
is
no
coffee
why
because
they
ca
get
sugar
ho
laughs
the
peasant
drinking
you
make
coffee
with
sugar
here
say
i
they
make
it
with
is
there
milk
no
no
milk
at
all
no
why
not
nobody
brings
it
yes
yes
there
is
milk
if
they
like
to
get
it
puts
in
the
peasant
but
they
want
you
to
drink
i
see
myself
drinking
my
yesterday
rage
towers
up
again
suddenly
till
it
quite
suffocates
me
there
is
something
in
this
unsavoury
black
thick
greasy
young
man
that
does
for
me
why
say
i
lapsing
into
the
italian
rhetorical
manner
why
do
you
keep
an
inn
why
do
you
write
the
word
ristorante
so
large
when
you
have
nothing
to
offer
people
and
do
intend
to
have
anything
why
do
you
have
the
impudence
to
take
in
travellers
what
does
it
mean
that
this
is
an
inn
what
say
what
does
it
mean
say
then
what
does
it
mean
what
does
it
mean
your
ristorante
risveglio
written
so
large
getting
all
this
out
in
one
breath
my
indignation
now
stifled
me
him
of
the
shirt
said
nothing
at
all
the
peasant
laughed
i
demanded
the
bill
it
was
francs
odd
i
picked
up
every
farthing
of
the
change
wo
you
leave
any
tip
at
all
asks
the
tip
say
i
speechless
so
we
march
upstairs
and
make
tea
to
fill
the
thermos
flask
then
with
sack
over
my
shoulder
i
make
my
way
out
of
the
risveglio
it
is
sunday
morning
the
frozen
village
street
is
almost
empty
we
march
down
to
the
wider
space
where
the
bus
stands
i
hope
they
the
impudence
to
call
it
a
piazza
is
this
the
nuoro
bus
i
ask
of
a
bunch
of
urchins
and
even
they
begin
to
jeer
but
my
sudden
flare
quenches
them
at
once
one
answers
yes
and
they
edge
away
i
stow
the
sack
and
the
kitchenino
in
the
part
the
is
in
front
we
shall
see
better
there
are
men
standing
about
with
their
hands
in
their
pockets
those
who
are
not
in
costume
some
wear
the
all
wear
the
stocking
caps
and
all
have
the
wide
white
their
waistcoats
being
just
like
evening
dress
waistcoats
imagine
one
of
these
soft
white
shirt
fronts
well
slobbered
and
you
have
mine
host
of
the
risveglio
but
these
lounging
static
men
are
snowily
clean
this
being
sunday
morning
they
smoke
their
pipes
on
the
frosty
air
and
are
none
too
friendly
the
bus
starts
at
nine
the
campanile
is
clanging
nine
two
or
three
girls
go
down
the
road
in
their
sunday
costume
of
purplish
brown
we
go
up
the
road
into
the
clear
ringing
frosty
air
to
find
the
lane
and
again
from
above
how
beautiful
it
is
in
the
sharp
morning
the
whole
village
lies
in
bluish
shadow
the
hills
with
their
thin
pale
oak
trees
are
in
bluish
shadow
still
only
in
the
distance
the
sun
makes
a
wonderful
radiance
on
the
pleasant
hills
wild
and
of
this
interior
region
real
fresh
all
around
and
such
humanity
returning
to
the
village
we
find
a
little
shop
and
get
biscuits
and
cigarettes
and
we
find
our
friends
the
they
are
shy
this
morning
they
are
ready
for
us
when
we
are
ready
so
in
we
get
joyfully
to
leave
sorgono
one
thing
i
say
for
it
it
must
be
an
honest
place
for
people
leave
their
sacks
about
without
a
qualm
up
we
go
up
the
road
only
to
stop
alas
at
the
risveglio
the
little
conductor
goes
down
the
lane
towards
the
station
the
driver
goes
and
has
a
little
drink
with
a
comrade
there
is
quite
a
crowd
round
the
dreary
entrances
of
the
inn
and
quite
a
little
bunch
of
people
to
clamber
up
into
the
second
class
behind
us
we
wait
and
wait
then
in
climbs
an
old
peasant
in
full
costume
smiling
in
the
pleased
naïve
way
of
the
old
after
him
climbs
a
young
man
with
a
na
said
the
young
man
now
you
are
in
the
automobile
and
the
old
man
gazes
round
with
the
wondering
vacant
naïve
smile
one
is
all
right
here
eh
the
young
citizen
persists
patronizing
but
the
old
man
is
too
excited
to
answer
he
gazes
hither
and
thither
then
he
suddenly
remembers
he
had
a
parcel
and
looks
for
it
in
fear
the
young
man
picks
it
from
the
floor
and
hands
it
him
ah
it
is
all
right
i
see
the
little
conductor
in
his
dashing
short
military
overcoat
striding
briskly
down
the
little
lane
with
the
the
driver
climbs
to
his
seat
in
front
of
me
he
has
a
muffler
round
his
neck
and
his
hat
pulled
down
to
his
ears
he
pips
at
the
horn
and
our
old
peasant
cranes
forward
to
look
how
he
does
it
and
so
with
a
jerk
and
a
spurt
we
start
uphill
eh
what
that
said
the
peasant
frightened
we
starting
explained
the
young
man
starting
did
we
start
before
the
bright
face
laughs
pleasedly
no
he
said
did
you
think
we
had
been
going
ever
since
you
got
in
yes
says
the
old
man
simply
since
the
door
was
shut
the
young
citizen
looks
at
us
for
our
joyful
approval
vi
to
nuoro
these
automobiles
in
italy
are
splendid
they
take
the
steep
looping
roads
so
easily
they
seem
to
run
so
naturally
and
this
one
was
comfortable
too
the
roads
of
italy
always
impress
me
they
run
undaunted
over
the
most
precipitous
regions
and
with
curious
ease
in
england
almost
any
such
road
among
the
mountains
at
least
would
be
labelled
three
times
dangerous
and
would
be
famous
throughout
the
land
as
an
impossible
climb
here
it
is
nothing
up
and
down
they
go
swinging
about
with
complete
there
seems
to
have
been
no
effort
in
their
construction
they
are
so
good
naturally
that
one
hardly
notices
what
splendid
gestures
they
represent
of
course
the
surface
is
now
often
intolerably
bad
and
they
are
most
of
them
roads
which
with
ten
neglect
will
become
ruins
for
they
are
cut
through
overhanging
rock
and
scooped
out
of
the
sides
of
hills
but
i
think
it
is
marvellous
how
the
italians
have
penetrated
all
their
inaccessible
regions
of
which
they
have
so
many
with
great
and
how
along
these
the
omnibuses
now
keep
up
a
perfect
communication
the
precipitous
and
land
is
threaded
through
and
through
with
roads
there
seems
to
be
a
passion
for
and
for
constant
communication
in
this
the
italians
have
a
real
roman
instinct
for
the
roads
are
new
the
railways
too
go
piercing
through
rock
for
miles
and
miles
and
nobody
thinks
anything
of
it
the
coast
railway
of
calabria
down
to
reggio
would
make
us
stand
on
our
heads
if
we
had
it
in
england
here
it
is
a
matter
of
course
in
the
same
way
i
always
have
a
profound
admiration
for
their
driving
whether
of
a
great
omnibus
or
of
a
it
all
seems
so
easy
as
if
the
man
were
part
of
the
car
there
is
none
of
that
beastly
grinding
uneasy
feeling
one
has
in
the
north
a
car
behaves
like
a
smooth
live
thing
sensibly
all
the
peasants
have
a
passion
for
a
they
want
their
land
opening
out
opening
out
they
seem
to
hate
the
ancient
italian
remoteness
they
all
want
to
be
able
to
get
out
at
a
moment
notice
to
get
away
quick
quick
a
village
which
is
two
miles
off
the
even
if
it
is
perched
like
a
hawk
nest
on
a
peak
still
chafes
and
chafes
for
the
great
road
to
come
to
it
chafes
and
chafes
for
the
daily
connection
with
the
railway
there
is
no
placidity
no
rest
in
the
heart
of
the
land
there
is
a
fever
of
restless
irritation
all
the
time
and
yet
the
permanent
way
of
almost
every
railway
is
falling
into
bad
disrepair
the
roads
are
shocking
and
nothing
seems
to
be
done
is
our
marvellous
mechanical
era
going
to
have
so
short
a
bloom
is
the
marvellous
openness
the
wonder
of
the
land
going
to
collapse
quite
soon
and
the
remote
places
lapse
back
into
inaccessibility
again
who
knows
i
rather
hope
so
the
automobile
took
us
rushing
and
winding
up
the
hill
sometimes
through
cold
shadow
sometimes
across
a
patch
of
sun
there
was
thin
bright
ice
in
the
ruts
and
deep
grey
on
the
grass
i
can
not
tell
how
the
sight
of
the
grass
and
bushes
heavy
with
frost
and
wild
in
their
own
primitive
wildness
charmed
me
the
slopes
of
the
steep
wild
hills
came
down
shaggy
and
bushy
with
a
few
berries
lingering
and
the
long
sere
with
the
frost
again
the
dark
valley
sank
below
like
a
ravine
but
shaggy
bosky
unbroken
it
came
upon
me
how
i
loved
the
sight
of
the
winter
with
its
frosty
standstill
the
young
oaks
keep
their
brown
leaves
and
doing
so
surely
they
are
best
with
a
thin
edge
of
rime
one
begins
to
realize
how
old
the
real
italy
is
how
and
how
withered
england
is
far
more
wild
and
savage
and
lonely
in
her
country
parts
here
since
endless
centuries
man
has
tamed
the
impossible
mountain
side
into
terraces
he
has
quarried
the
rock
he
has
fed
his
sheep
among
the
thin
woods
he
has
cut
his
boughs
and
burnt
his
charcoal
he
has
been
half
domesticated
even
among
the
wildest
fastnesses
this
is
what
is
so
attractive
about
the
remote
places
the
abruzzi
for
example
life
is
so
primitive
so
pagan
so
strangely
heathen
and
and
yet
it
is
human
life
and
the
wildest
country
is
half
humanized
half
brought
under
it
is
all
conscious
wherever
one
is
in
italy
either
one
is
conscious
of
the
present
or
of
the
mediaeval
influences
or
of
the
far
mysterious
gods
of
the
early
mediterranean
wherever
one
is
the
place
has
its
conscious
genus
man
has
lived
there
and
brought
forth
his
consciousness
there
and
in
some
way
brought
that
place
to
consciousness
given
it
its
expression
and
really
finished
it
the
expression
may
be
proserpine
or
pan
or
even
the
strange
shrouded
gods
of
the
etruscans
or
the
sikels
none
the
less
it
is
an
expression
the
land
has
been
humanised
through
and
through
and
we
in
our
own
tissued
consciousness
bear
the
results
of
this
humanisation
so
that
for
us
to
go
to
italy
and
to
into
italy
is
like
a
most
fascinating
act
of
back
back
down
the
old
ways
of
time
strange
and
wonderful
chords
awake
in
us
and
vibrate
again
after
many
hundreds
of
years
of
complete
forgetfulness
and
then
and
then
there
is
a
final
feeling
of
sterility
it
is
all
worked
out
it
is
all
known
connu
this
sunday
morning
seeing
the
frost
among
the
tangled
still
savage
bushes
of
sardinia
my
soul
thrilled
again
this
was
not
all
known
this
was
not
all
worked
out
life
was
not
only
a
process
of
rediscovering
backwards
it
is
that
also
and
it
is
that
intensely
italy
has
given
me
back
i
know
not
what
of
myself
but
a
very
very
great
deal
she
has
found
for
me
so
much
that
was
lost
like
a
restored
osiris
but
this
morning
in
the
omnibus
i
realize
that
apart
from
the
great
rediscovery
backwards
which
one
make
before
one
can
be
whole
at
all
there
is
a
move
forwards
there
are
unknown
unworked
lands
where
the
salt
has
not
lost
its
savour
but
one
must
have
perfected
oneself
in
the
great
past
first
if
one
travels
one
eats
we
immediately
began
to
munch
biscuits
and
the
old
peasant
in
his
white
baggy
breeches
and
black
cuirass
his
old
face
smiling
wonderingly
under
his
old
stocking
cap
although
he
was
only
going
to
tonara
some
seven
or
eight
miles
began
to
peel
himself
a
egg
which
he
got
out
of
his
parcel
with
calm
wastefulness
he
peeled
away
the
biggest
part
of
the
white
of
the
egg
with
the
shell
because
it
came
away
so
the
citizen
of
nuoro
for
such
the
young
man
was
said
to
him
but
see
how
you
waste
ha
said
the
old
peasant
with
a
reckless
indifferent
wave
of
the
hand
what
did
he
care
how
much
he
wasted
since
he
was
and
riding
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
in
an
automobile
the
citizen
of
nuoro
told
us
he
had
some
sort
of
business
in
sorgono
so
he
came
back
and
forth
constantly
the
peasant
did
some
work
or
other
for
him
or
brought
him
something
down
from
tonara
he
was
a
pleasant
young
man
and
he
made
nothing
of
eight
hours
in
a
he
told
us
there
was
still
game
among
these
hills
wild
boars
which
were
hunted
in
big
hunts
and
many
hares
it
was
a
curious
and
beautiful
sight
he
said
to
see
a
hare
at
night
fascinated
by
the
flare
of
the
lamps
of
the
automobile
racing
ahead
with
its
ears
back
always
keeping
in
front
inside
the
beam
and
flying
like
mad
on
and
on
ahead
till
at
some
hill
it
gathered
speed
and
melted
into
the
dark
we
descended
into
a
deep
narrow
valley
to
the
and
the
then
up
again
up
and
up
sharp
to
tonara
our
village
we
had
seen
in
the
sun
yesterday
but
we
were
approaching
it
from
the
back
as
we
swerved
into
the
sunlight
the
road
took
a
long
curve
on
to
the
open
ridge
between
two
valleys
and
there
in
front
we
saw
a
glitter
of
scarlet
and
white
it
was
in
slow
motion
it
was
a
procession
scarlet
figures
of
women
and
a
tall
image
moving
away
from
us
slowly
in
the
sunday
morning
it
was
passing
along
the
level
sunlit
ridge
above
a
deep
hollow
valley
a
close
procession
of
women
glittering
in
scarlet
white
and
black
moving
slowly
in
the
distance
beneath
the
buildings
of
the
village
on
the
crest
towards
an
isolated
old
church
and
all
along
this
narrow
upland
saddle
as
on
a
bridge
of
sunshine
itself
were
we
not
going
to
see
any
more
the
bus
turned
again
and
rushed
along
the
now
level
road
and
then
veered
and
there
beyond
a
little
below
we
saw
the
procession
the
bus
faded
to
a
standstill
and
we
climbed
out
above
us
old
and
mellowed
among
the
smooth
rocks
and
the
bits
of
flat
grass
was
the
church
tanging
its
bell
just
in
front
above
were
old
houses
of
stone
the
road
came
gently
winding
up
to
us
from
what
was
evidently
two
villages
ledged
one
above
the
other
upon
the
steep
summit
of
the
south
slope
far
below
was
the
south
valley
with
a
white
puff
of
engine
steam
and
slowly
chanting
in
the
near
distance
curving
slowly
up
to
us
on
the
white
road
between
the
grass
came
the
procession
the
high
morning
was
still
we
stood
all
on
this
ridge
above
the
world
with
the
deeps
of
silence
below
on
the
right
and
in
a
strange
brief
staccato
monody
chanted
the
men
and
in
quick
light
rustle
of
women
voices
came
the
responses
again
the
men
voices
the
white
was
mostly
men
not
women
the
priest
in
his
robes
his
boys
near
him
was
leading
the
chanting
immediately
behind
him
came
a
small
cluster
of
tall
sunburnt
men
all
in
corduroy
bowing
beneath
a
great
seated
image
of
saint
anthony
of
padua
after
these
a
number
of
men
in
the
costume
but
with
the
white
linen
breeches
hanging
wide
and
loose
almost
to
the
ankles
instead
of
being
tucked
into
the
black
gaiters
so
they
seemed
very
white
beneath
the
back
kilt
frill
the
black
frieze
was
cut
low
like
an
evening
suit
and
the
stocking
caps
were
variously
perched
the
men
chanted
in
low
hollow
melodic
tones
then
came
the
rustling
chime
of
the
women
and
the
procession
crept
slowly
aimlessly
forward
in
time
with
the
chant
the
great
image
rode
rigid
and
rather
foolish
after
the
men
was
a
little
gap
and
then
the
brilliant
wedge
of
the
women
they
were
packed
two
by
two
close
on
each
other
heels
chanting
inadvertently
when
their
turn
came
and
all
in
brilliant
beautiful
costume
in
front
were
the
little
two
by
two
immediately
following
the
tall
men
in
peasant
children
demure
and
conventional
in
vermilion
white
and
green
little
with
long
skirts
of
scarlet
cloth
down
to
their
feet
near
the
bottom
with
white
aprons
bordered
with
vivid
green
and
mingled
colour
having
little
scarlet
open
boleros
over
the
full
white
shirts
and
black
folded
across
their
little
chins
just
leaving
the
lips
clear
the
face
framed
in
black
wonderful
little
perfect
and
demure
in
the
stiffish
brilliant
costume
with
black
stiff
as
velasquez
princesses
the
bigger
girls
followed
and
then
the
mature
women
a
close
procession
the
long
vermilion
skirts
with
their
green
bands
at
the
bottom
flashed
a
solid
moving
mass
of
colour
softly
swinging
and
the
white
aprons
with
their
band
of
brilliant
mingled
green
seemed
to
gleam
at
the
throat
the
white
shirts
were
fastened
with
big
studs
of
gold
filigree
two
linked
filigree
globes
and
the
great
white
sleeves
billowed
from
the
scarlet
boleros
the
faces
came
nearer
to
us
framed
all
round
in
the
dark
cloths
all
the
lips
still
sang
responses
but
all
the
eyes
watched
us
so
the
coloured
body
of
the
procession
came
up
to
us
the
smooth
cloth
rocked
in
fusion
the
bands
and
bars
of
emerald
green
seemed
to
burn
across
the
red
and
the
showy
white
the
dark
eyes
peered
and
stared
at
us
from
under
the
black
snood
gazed
back
at
us
with
raging
curiosity
while
the
lips
moved
automatically
in
chant
the
bus
had
run
into
the
inner
side
of
the
road
and
the
procession
had
to
press
round
it
towards
the
the
great
valley
lying
below
the
priest
stared
hideous
anthony
cockled
a
bit
as
he
passed
the
butt
end
of
the
big
grey
automobile
the
peasant
men
in
corduroy
old
washed
soft
were
sweating
under
the
load
and
still
singing
with
opened
lips
the
loose
white
breeches
of
the
men
waggled
as
they
walked
on
with
their
hands
behind
their
backs
turning
again
to
look
at
us
the
big
hard
hands
folded
behind
black
the
women
too
shuffled
slowly
past
rocking
the
scarlet
and
the
bars
of
green
and
all
twisting
as
they
sang
to
look
at
us
still
more
and
so
the
procession
edged
past
the
bus
and
was
trailing
upwards
curved
solid
against
the
towards
the
old
church
from
behind
the
geranium
scarlet
was
intense
one
saw
the
careful
curiously
cut
backs
of
the
shapen
boleros
edged
with
and
green
and
the
white
of
the
shirt
just
showing
at
the
waist
the
full
sleeves
billowed
out
the
black
hung
down
to
a
point
the
pleated
skirts
swing
slowly
the
broad
band
of
green
accentuating
the
motion
indeed
that
is
what
it
must
be
for
this
thick
rich
band
of
jewel
green
to
throw
the
wonderful
horizontal
motion
back
and
forth
back
and
forth
of
the
suave
vermilion
and
give
that
static
demeta
splendor
to
a
peasant
motion
so
magnificent
in
colour
geranium
and
malachite
all
the
costumes
were
not
exactly
alike
some
had
more
green
some
had
less
in
some
the
sleeveless
boleros
were
of
a
darker
red
and
some
had
poorer
aprons
without
such
gorgeous
bands
at
the
bottom
and
some
were
evidently
old
probably
thirty
years
old
still
perfect
and
in
keeping
reserved
for
sunday
and
high
holidays
a
few
were
darker
ruddier
than
the
true
vermilion
this
varying
of
the
tone
intensified
the
beauty
of
the
shuffling
when
they
had
filed
into
the
grey
forlorn
little
church
on
the
just
above
us
the
bus
started
silently
to
run
on
to
the
below
whilst
we
climbed
back
up
the
little
to
the
church
when
we
came
to
the
we
found
the
church
quite
full
level
with
us
as
we
stood
in
the
open
side
doorway
we
saw
kneeling
on
the
bare
stoneflags
the
little
and
behind
them
all
the
women
clustered
kneeling
upon
their
aprons
with
hands
negligently
folded
filling
the
church
to
the
further
doorway
where
the
sun
shone
the
bigger
doorway
in
the
shadow
of
the
whitewashed
bare
church
all
these
kneeling
women
with
their
colour
and
their
black
looked
like
some
thick
bed
of
flowers
geranium
black
hooded
above
they
all
knelt
on
the
naked
solid
stone
of
the
pavement
there
was
a
space
in
front
of
the
geranium
little
then
the
men
in
corduroys
with
dark
round
heads
kneeling
awkwardly
in
reverence
and
then
the
queer
black
cuirasses
and
full
white
sleeves
of
peasant
men
many
bearded
then
just
in
front
of
them
the
priest
in
his
white
vestment
standing
exposed
and
just
baldly
beginning
an
address
at
the
side
of
the
altar
was
seated
large
and
important
the
modern
simpering
anthony
of
padua
nursing
a
he
looked
a
sort
of
male
madonna
now
the
priest
was
saying
blessed
saint
anthony
shows
you
in
what
way
you
can
be
christians
it
is
not
enough
that
you
are
not
turks
some
think
they
are
christians
because
they
are
not
turks
it
is
true
you
are
none
of
you
turks
but
you
have
still
to
learn
how
to
be
good
christians
and
this
you
can
learn
from
our
blessed
saint
anthony
saint
anthony
etc
the
contrast
between
turks
and
christians
is
still
forceful
in
the
mediterranean
where
the
mohammedans
have
left
such
a
mark
but
how
the
word
spoken
with
a
peculiar
priestly
unction
gets
on
my
nerves
the
voice
is
barren
in
its
homily
and
the
women
are
all
intensely
watching
the
and
me
in
the
doorway
their
folded
hands
are
very
negligently
held
together
come
away
say
i
come
away
and
let
them
listen
we
left
the
church
crowded
with
its
kneeling
host
and
dropped
down
past
the
broken
houses
towards
the
omnibus
which
stood
on
a
sort
of
level
place
a
levelled
terrace
with
a
few
trees
standing
silent
over
the
valley
it
should
be
picketed
with
soldiers
having
arquebuses
and
i
should
have
welcomed
a
few
infidels
as
a
leaven
to
this
dreary
christianity
of
ours
but
it
was
a
wonderful
place
usually
the
is
reckoned
as
but
here
in
the
heart
of
sardinia
the
is
high
as
the
plateau
and
the
is
somewhere
far
away
below
in
the
gloom
it
does
not
signify
the
is
high
up
high
and
and
among
rocks
we
stood
and
looked
below
at
the
puff
of
steam
far
down
the
wooded
valley
where
we
had
come
yesterday
there
was
an
old
low
house
on
this
piazza
i
would
like
to
live
there
the
real
village
or
rather
two
villages
like
an
and
its
pendant
lay
still
beyond
in
front
ledging
near
the
summit
of
the
long
long
steep
wooded
slope
that
never
ended
till
it
ran
flush
to
the
depths
away
below
there
in
shadow
and
yesterday
up
this
slope
the
old
peasant
had
come
with
his
two
brilliant
daughters
and
the
and
somewhere
in
those
ledging
pearly
villages
in
front
must
be
my
girovago
and
his
wife
i
wish
i
could
see
their
stall
and
drink
aqua
vitae
with
them
how
beautiful
the
procession
says
the
to
the
driver
ah
yes
one
of
the
most
beautiful
costumes
of
sardinia
this
of
tonara
he
replied
wistfully
the
bus
sets
off
again
minus
the
old
peasant
we
retrace
our
road
a
woman
is
leading
a
bay
pony
past
the
church
striding
with
long
strides
so
that
her
maroon
skirt
swings
like
a
fan
and
hauling
the
halter
rope
apparently
the
geranium
red
costume
is
sunday
only
the
is
this
maroon
or
puce
or
quickly
and
easily
the
bus
slips
down
the
hill
into
the
valley
wild
narrow
valleys
with
trees
and
cork
trees
across
the
other
side
a
black
and
white
peasant
is
working
alone
on
a
tiny
terrace
of
the
a
small
solitary
figure
for
all
the
world
like
a
magpie
in
the
distance
these
people
like
being
alone
solitary
one
sees
a
single
creature
so
often
isolated
among
the
wilds
this
is
different
from
sicily
and
italy
where
the
people
simply
can
not
be
alone
they
be
in
twos
and
threes
but
it
is
sunday
morning
and
the
worker
is
exceptional
along
the
road
we
pass
various
pedestrians
men
in
their
black
sheepskins
boys
in
their
soldiers
remains
they
are
trudging
from
one
village
to
another
across
the
wild
valleys
and
there
is
a
sense
of
sunday
morning
freedom
of
roving
as
in
an
english
countryside
only
the
one
old
peasant
works
alone
and
a
goatherd
watching
his
white
goats
beautiful
the
goats
are
and
so
swift
they
fly
like
white
shadows
along
the
road
from
us
then
dart
i
see
one
standing
on
a
bough
of
an
right
in
the
tree
an
enormous
white
complacently
munching
up
aloft
then
rearing
on
her
hind
legs
so
lengthy
and
putting
her
slim
paws
far
away
on
an
upper
forward
branch
whenever
we
come
to
a
village
we
stop
and
get
down
and
our
little
conductor
disappears
into
the
for
the
this
last
is
usually
a
limp
affair
containing
about
three
letters
the
people
crowd
round
and
many
of
them
in
very
ragged
costume
they
look
poor
and
not
attractive
perhaps
a
bit
degenerate
it
would
seem
as
if
the
italian
instinct
to
get
into
rapid
touch
with
the
world
were
the
healthy
instinct
after
all
for
in
these
isolated
villages
which
have
been
since
time
began
far
from
any
there
is
an
almost
sordid
look
on
the
faces
of
the
people
we
must
remember
that
the
is
a
great
innovation
it
has
been
running
for
five
weeks
only
i
wonder
for
how
many
months
it
will
continue
for
i
am
sure
it
can
not
pay
our
tickets
cost
i
believe
about
francs
each
the
second
class
costs
about
the
first
some
parts
of
the
journey
we
were
very
few
passengers
the
distance
covered
is
so
great
the
population
so
thin
that
even
granted
the
passion
for
getting
out
of
their
own
villages
which
possesses
all
people
now
still
the
bus
can
not
earn
much
more
than
an
average
of
two
hundred
to
three
hundred
francs
a
day
which
with
two
men
wages
and
petrol
at
its
enormous
price
and
the
cost
of
can
not
possibly
pay
i
asked
the
driver
he
did
not
tell
me
what
his
wages
were
i
did
not
ask
him
but
he
said
the
company
paid
for
the
keep
and
lodging
for
himself
and
mate
at
the
this
being
sunday
fewer
people
were
travelling
a
statement
hard
to
believe
once
he
had
carried
fifty
people
all
the
way
from
tonara
to
nuoro
once
but
it
was
in
vain
he
protested
ah
well
he
said
the
bus
carried
the
post
and
the
government
paid
a
subsidy
of
so
many
thousands
of
lire
a
year
a
goodly
number
apparently
then
the
government
was
the
loser
as
usual
and
there
are
hundreds
if
not
thousands
of
these
omnibuses
running
the
lonely
districts
of
italy
and
sicily
sardinia
had
a
network
of
systems
they
are
splendid
and
they
are
perhaps
an
absolute
necessity
for
a
nervous
restless
population
which
simply
can
not
keep
still
and
which
finds
some
relief
in
being
whirled
about
even
on
the
as
the
is
called
the
autovie
are
run
by
private
companies
only
subsidised
by
the
government
on
we
rush
through
the
morning
and
at
length
see
a
large
village
high
on
the
summit
beyond
stony
on
the
high
upland
but
it
has
a
magical
look
as
these
tiny
have
from
the
distance
they
recall
to
me
always
my
childish
visions
of
jerusalem
high
against
the
air
and
seeming
to
sparkle
and
built
in
sharp
cubes
it
is
curious
what
a
difference
there
is
between
the
high
fresh
proud
villages
and
the
valley
villages
those
that
crown
the
world
have
a
bright
flashing
air
as
tonara
had
those
that
lie
down
below
infolded
in
the
shadow
have
a
gloomy
sordid
feeling
and
a
repellent
population
like
sorgono
and
other
places
at
which
we
had
halted
the
judgment
may
be
all
wrong
but
this
was
the
impression
i
got
we
were
now
at
the
highest
point
of
the
journey
the
men
we
saw
on
the
road
were
in
their
sheepskins
and
some
were
even
walking
with
their
faces
glancing
back
we
saw
up
the
valley
clefts
the
snow
of
gennargentu
once
more
a
white
mantle
on
broad
shoulders
the
very
core
of
sardinia
the
bus
slid
to
a
standstill
in
a
high
valley
beside
a
stream
where
the
road
from
fonni
joined
ours
there
was
waiting
a
youth
with
a
bicycle
i
would
like
to
go
to
fonni
they
say
it
is
the
highest
village
in
sardinia
in
front
on
the
broad
summit
reared
the
towers
of
gavoi
this
was
the
halt
where
the
buses
had
their
and
where
we
would
stay
for
an
hour
and
eat
we
wound
up
and
up
the
looping
road
and
at
last
entered
the
village
women
came
to
the
doors
to
look
they
were
wearing
the
dark
costume
men
were
hastening
smoking
their
pipes
towards
our
stopping
place
we
saw
the
other
bus
a
little
crowd
of
people
and
we
drew
up
at
last
we
were
tired
and
hungry
we
were
at
the
door
of
the
inn
and
we
entered
quickly
and
in
an
instant
what
a
difference
at
the
clean
little
bar
men
were
drinking
cheerfully
a
side
door
led
into
the
common
room
and
how
charming
it
was
in
a
very
wide
chimney
white
and
with
a
lovely
shallow
curve
above
was
burning
a
fire
of
long
faggots
laid
horizontally
on
the
dogs
a
clean
clear
bright
fire
with
odd
little
chairs
in
front
very
low
for
us
to
sit
on
the
funny
low
little
chairs
seem
a
specialty
of
this
region
the
floor
of
this
room
was
paved
with
round
dark
pebbles
beautifully
clean
on
the
walls
hung
brilliant
copper
fans
glittering
against
the
whitewash
and
under
the
long
horizontal
window
that
looked
on
the
street
was
a
stone
slab
with
sockets
for
little
charcoal
fires
the
curve
of
the
chimney
arch
was
wide
and
shallow
the
curve
above
the
window
was
still
wider
and
of
a
similar
delicate
shallowness
the
white
roof
rose
delicately
vaulted
with
the
glitter
of
copper
the
expanse
of
dark
pebbled
floor
the
space
the
few
low
faggots
it
was
really
beautiful
we
sat
and
warmed
ourselves
welcomed
by
a
plump
hostess
and
a
pleasant
daughter
both
in
dress
and
full
white
shirt
people
strayed
in
and
out
through
the
various
doors
the
houses
are
built
without
any
plan
at
all
the
rooms
just
happening
here
or
there
a
bitch
came
from
an
inner
darkness
and
stood
looking
at
the
fire
then
looked
up
at
me
smiling
in
her
complacent
fashion
but
we
were
dying
with
hunger
what
was
there
to
eat
and
was
it
nearly
ready
there
was
the
pleasant
girl
told
us
and
it
was
nearly
ready
being
wild
boar
we
sniffed
the
air
the
girl
kept
tramping
rather
fecklessly
back
and
forth
with
a
plate
or
a
serviette
and
at
last
it
was
served
we
went
through
the
dark
inner
place
which
was
apparently
the
windowless
bit
left
over
inside
when
the
rooms
were
made
round
about
and
from
thence
into
a
large
bare
darkish
pebbled
room
with
a
white
table
and
inverted
it
was
deathly
cold
the
window
looked
north
over
the
wintry
landscape
of
the
highlands
fields
stone
walls
and
rocks
ah
the
cold
motionless
air
of
the
room
but
we
were
quite
a
party
the
second
and
his
mate
a
bearded
traveller
on
the
second
bus
with
his
daughter
ourselves
the
citizen
from
nuoro
and
our
driver
our
little
conductor
did
not
come
it
dawned
on
me
later
he
could
not
afford
to
pay
for
this
meal
which
was
not
included
in
his
wage
the
nuoro
citizen
conferred
with
our
driver
who
looked
tired
round
the
eyes
and
made
the
girl
produce
a
tin
of
sardines
these
were
opened
at
table
with
a
large
belonging
to
the
second
conductor
he
was
a
reckless
odd
fellow
whom
i
liked
very
much
but
i
was
terrified
at
the
way
he
carved
the
with
his
however
we
could
eat
and
drink
then
came
the
the
broth
in
a
great
bowl
this
was
boiling
hot
and
very
very
strong
it
was
perfectly
plain
strong
without
vegetables
but
how
good
and
invigorating
it
was
and
what
an
abundance
we
drank
it
down
and
ate
the
good
cold
bread
then
came
the
boar
itself
alas
it
was
a
bowl
of
hunks
of
dark
rather
coarse
boiled
meat
from
which
the
broth
had
been
made
it
was
quite
dry
without
fat
i
should
have
been
very
puzzled
to
know
what
meat
it
was
if
i
had
not
been
told
sad
that
the
wild
boar
should
have
received
so
little
culinary
attention
however
we
ate
the
hunks
of
hot
dry
meat
with
bread
and
were
glad
to
get
them
they
were
filling
at
least
and
there
was
a
bowl
of
rather
bitter
green
olives
for
a
condiment
the
nuoro
citizen
now
produced
a
huge
bottle
of
wine
which
he
said
was
and
refused
to
let
us
go
on
with
the
dark
wine
on
the
table
of
which
every
guest
was
served
with
a
bottle
so
we
drank
up
and
were
replenished
with
the
redder
lighter
finer
sorgono
wine
it
was
very
good
the
second
also
did
not
eat
the
inn
meal
he
produced
a
vast
piece
of
bread
good
bread
and
at
least
half
of
a
roast
lamb
and
a
large
paper
of
olives
this
lamb
he
insisted
on
sending
round
the
table
waving
his
knife
and
fork
with
dramatic
gestures
at
every
guest
insisting
that
every
guest
should
take
a
hunk
so
one
by
one
we
all
helped
ourselves
to
the
extraordinarily
good
cold
roast
lamb
and
to
the
olives
then
the
fell
to
as
well
there
was
a
mass
of
meat
still
left
to
him
it
is
extraordinary
how
generous
and
from
the
inside
these
men
were
to
be
sure
the
second
conductor
waved
his
knife
and
fork
and
made
bitter
faces
if
one
of
us
took
only
a
little
bit
of
the
lamb
he
wanted
us
to
take
more
but
the
courtesy
in
all
of
them
was
quite
perfect
so
manly
and
utterly
simple
just
the
same
with
the
they
treated
her
with
a
sensitive
manly
simplicity
which
one
could
not
but
be
thankful
for
they
made
none
of
the
odious
politenesses
which
are
so
detestable
in
people
they
made
no
advances
and
did
none
of
the
hateful
homage
of
the
adulating
male
they
were
quiet
and
kind
and
sensitive
to
the
natural
flow
of
life
and
quite
without
airs
i
liked
them
extremely
men
who
can
be
quietly
kind
and
simple
to
a
woman
without
wanting
to
show
off
or
to
make
an
impression
they
are
men
still
they
were
neither
humble
nor
conceited
they
did
not
show
off
and
oh
god
what
a
blessed
relief
to
be
with
people
who
bother
to
show
off
we
sat
at
that
table
quietly
and
naturally
as
if
we
were
by
ourselves
and
talked
or
listened
to
their
talk
just
as
it
happened
when
we
did
not
want
to
talk
they
took
no
notice
of
us
and
that
i
call
good
manners
showing
off
people
would
have
found
them
uncouth
i
found
them
almost
the
only
really
people
i
have
met
they
did
not
show
off
in
any
way
at
all
not
even
a
show
of
simplicity
they
knew
that
in
the
beginning
and
in
the
end
a
man
stands
alone
his
soul
is
alone
in
itself
and
all
attributes
are
nothing
and
this
curious
final
knowledge
preserved
them
in
simplicity
when
we
had
had
coffee
and
were
going
out
i
found
our
own
conductor
in
a
little
chair
by
the
fire
he
was
looking
a
bit
pathetic
i
had
enough
sense
to
give
him
a
coffee
which
brightened
him
but
it
was
not
till
afterwards
putting
things
together
that
i
realized
he
had
wanted
to
be
with
us
all
at
table
but
that
his
conductor
wages
probably
did
not
allow
him
to
spend
the
money
my
bill
for
the
dinner
was
about
fifteen
francs
for
the
two
of
us
in
the
bus
again
we
were
quite
crowded
a
peasant
girl
in
nuoro
costume
sat
facing
me
and
a
man
in
a
brown
velveteen
suit
was
next
me
and
glowering
at
her
he
was
evidently
her
husband
i
did
not
like
him
one
of
the
jealous
carping
sort
she
in
her
way
was
handsome
but
a
bit
of
a
devil
as
well
in
all
probability
there
were
two
village
women
become
fine
in
town
dress
and
black
silk
scarves
over
their
heads
fancying
themselves
then
there
was
a
wild
scuffle
and
three
bouncing
village
lasses
were
pushed
in
laughing
and
wild
with
excitement
there
were
wild
farewells
and
the
bus
rolled
out
of
gavoi
between
the
desolate
mountain
fields
and
the
rocks
on
a
sort
of
we
rolled
on
for
a
mile
or
so
then
stopped
and
the
excited
lasses
got
down
i
gathered
they
had
been
given
a
little
ride
for
a
sunday
treat
delighted
they
were
and
they
set
off
with
other
women
in
costume
along
a
bare
path
between
flat
rocks
and
cold
fields
the
girl
facing
me
was
a
study
she
was
not
more
than
twenty
years
old
i
should
say
or
was
she
did
the
delicate
and
fine
complication
of
lines
against
her
eyes
mean
but
anyhow
she
was
the
wife
of
the
velveteen
man
he
was
and
had
white
hairs
in
his
coarse
black
beard
and
little
irritable
brown
eyes
under
his
irritable
brows
he
watched
her
all
the
time
perhaps
she
was
after
all
a
young
new
she
sat
with
that
expressionless
look
of
one
who
is
watched
and
who
appears
not
to
know
it
she
had
her
back
to
the
engine
illustration
gavoi
she
wore
her
black
from
her
brow
and
her
hair
was
taken
tight
back
from
her
rather
hard
broad
forehead
her
dark
eyebrows
were
very
finely
drawn
above
her
large
pellucid
eyes
but
they
were
drawn
with
a
peculiar
obstinate
and
irritating
lift
her
nose
was
straight
and
small
her
mouth
and
her
big
rather
hostile
eyes
had
a
withheld
look
in
them
obstinate
yet
being
newly
wed
and
probably
her
eyes
looked
sometimes
at
me
with
a
provoking
look
curious
as
to
what
i
was
in
the
husband
line
challenging
rather
defiantly
with
her
new
secrets
obstinate
in
opposition
to
the
male
authority
and
yet
intrigued
by
the
very
fact
that
one
was
man
the
velveteen
husband
his
velveteens
too
had
gone
soft
and
yet
somehow
they
made
him
look
ugly
common
he
watched
her
with
his
irritable
eyes
and
seemed
to
fume
in
his
stiff
beard
she
wore
the
costume
the
shirt
fastened
at
the
throat
with
the
two
gold
filigree
globes
a
little
dark
braided
stiff
bolero
just
fastened
at
the
waist
leaving
a
pretty
pattern
of
white
breast
and
a
dark
maroon
skirt
as
the
bus
rushed
along
she
turned
somewhat
pale
with
the
obstinate
pinched
look
of
a
woman
who
is
in
opposition
to
her
man
at
length
she
flung
him
a
few
words
which
i
did
not
catch
and
her
forehead
seemed
to
go
harder
as
she
drooped
her
lashes
occasionally
over
her
wide
alert
obstinate
rather
treacherous
eyes
she
must
have
been
a
difficult
piece
of
goods
to
deal
with
and
she
sat
with
her
knees
touching
mine
rocking
against
mine
as
the
bus
swayed
we
came
to
a
village
on
the
road
the
landscape
had
now
become
wider
much
more
open
at
the
inn
door
the
bus
stopped
and
the
velveteen
husband
and
the
girl
got
down
it
was
cold
but
in
a
minute
i
got
down
too
the
bus
conductor
came
to
me
and
asked
anxiously
if
the
were
ill
the
said
no
why
because
there
was
a
signora
whom
the
motion
of
the
bus
made
ill
this
was
the
girl
there
was
a
crowd
and
a
great
row
at
this
inn
in
the
second
dark
room
which
was
bare
of
furniture
a
man
sat
in
a
corner
playing
an
accordion
men
in
the
close
breeches
were
dancing
together
then
they
fell
to
wrestling
wildly
crashing
about
among
the
others
with
shouts
and
yells
men
in
the
but
untidy
with
the
wide
white
drawers
left
hanging
out
over
the
black
gaiters
surged
here
and
there
all
were
rowdy
with
drink
this
again
was
rather
a
squalid
inn
but
roaring
with
violent
crude
male
life
the
nuoro
citizen
said
that
here
was
very
good
wine
and
we
must
try
it
i
did
not
want
it
but
he
insisted
so
we
drank
little
glasses
of
merely
moderate
red
wine
the
sky
had
gone
all
grey
with
the
afternoon
it
was
very
cold
and
raw
wine
is
no
joy
cold
dead
wine
in
such
an
atmosphere
the
nuoro
citizen
insisted
on
paying
he
would
let
me
pay
he
said
when
he
came
to
england
in
him
and
in
our
bus
men
the
famous
sardinian
hospitality
and
generosity
still
lingers
when
the
bus
ran
on
again
the
told
the
peasant
girl
who
again
had
the
pinched
look
to
change
places
with
me
and
sit
with
her
face
to
the
engine
this
the
young
woman
did
with
that
rather
hard
assurance
common
to
these
women
but
at
the
next
stop
she
got
down
and
made
the
conductor
come
with
us
into
the
compartment
whilst
she
sat
in
front
between
the
driver
and
the
citizen
of
nuoro
that
was
what
she
wanted
all
the
time
now
she
was
all
right
she
had
her
back
to
the
velveteen
husband
she
sat
close
between
two
strange
young
men
who
were
condoling
with
her
and
velveteens
eyed
her
back
and
his
little
eyes
went
littler
and
more
and
his
nose
seemed
to
curl
with
irritation
the
costumes
had
changed
again
there
was
again
the
scarlet
but
no
green
the
green
had
given
place
to
mauve
and
rose
the
women
in
one
cold
stony
rather
humbled
broken
place
were
most
brilliant
they
had
the
geranium
skirts
but
their
sleeveless
boleros
were
made
to
curl
out
strangely
from
the
waist
and
they
were
edged
with
a
puckered
a
broad
edge
with
lines
of
mauve
and
lavender
as
they
went
up
between
the
houses
that
were
dark
and
grisly
under
the
blank
cold
sky
it
is
amazing
how
these
women
of
vermilion
and
seemed
to
melt
into
an
almost
impossible
blare
of
colour
what
a
risky
blend
of
colours
yet
how
superb
it
could
look
that
dangerous
hard
assurance
of
these
women
as
they
strode
along
so
blaring
i
would
not
like
to
tackle
one
of
them
wider
and
colder
the
landscape
grew
as
we
topped
a
hill
at
the
end
of
a
village
we
saw
a
long
string
of
wagons
each
with
a
pair
of
oxen
and
laden
with
large
sacks
curving
upwards
in
the
cold
pallid
sunday
afternoon
seeing
us
the
procession
came
to
a
standstill
at
the
curve
of
the
road
and
the
pale
oxen
the
pale
low
wagons
the
pale
full
sacks
all
in
the
blenched
light
each
one
headed
by
a
tall
man
in
trailing
a
static
procession
on
the
seemed
like
a
vision
like
a
doré
drawing
the
bus
slid
past
the
man
holding
the
while
some
oxen
stood
like
rock
some
swayed
their
horns
the
asked
the
velveteener
what
they
were
carrying
for
a
long
time
he
took
no
notice
of
the
question
then
he
volunteered
in
a
snappy
voice
that
it
was
the
government
grain
being
distributed
to
the
communes
for
bread
on
sunday
afternoon
too
oh
this
government
corn
what
a
problem
those
sacks
represent
the
country
became
wider
as
we
dropped
lower
but
it
was
bleak
and
treeless
once
more
stones
cropped
up
in
the
wide
hollow
dales
men
on
ponies
passed
forlorn
across
the
distances
men
with
bundles
waited
at
the
to
pick
up
the
bus
we
were
drawing
near
to
nuoro
it
was
past
three
in
the
afternoon
cold
with
a
blenched
light
the
landscape
seemed
bare
and
stony
wide
different
from
any
before
we
came
to
the
valley
where
the
runs
to
nuoro
i
saw
little
pink
at
once
lonely
along
the
valley
bed
turning
sharp
to
the
right
we
ran
in
silence
over
the
slopes
and
saw
the
town
beyond
clustered
beyond
a
little
below
at
the
end
of
the
long
declivity
with
sudden
mountains
rising
around
it
there
it
lay
as
if
at
the
end
of
the
world
mountains
rising
sombre
behind
so
we
stop
at
the
dazio
the
town
customs
hut
and
velveteens
has
to
pay
for
some
meat
and
cheese
he
is
bringing
in
after
which
we
slip
into
the
cold
of
nuoro
i
am
thinking
that
this
is
the
home
of
grazia
deledda
the
novelist
and
i
see
a
barber
shop
de
ledda
and
thank
heaven
we
are
at
the
end
of
the
journey
it
is
past
four
the
bus
has
stopped
quite
close
to
the
door
of
the
inn
star
of
italy
was
it
in
we
go
at
the
open
door
nobody
about
free
access
to
anywhere
and
everywhere
as
usual
testifying
again
to
sardinian
honesty
we
peer
through
a
doorway
to
the
left
through
a
rough
little
room
ah
there
in
a
dark
biggish
room
beyond
is
a
old
woman
with
a
long
face
standing
at
a
large
table
ironing
one
sees
only
the
large
whiteness
of
the
table
and
the
long
pallid
face
and
the
querulous
eye
of
the
tall
old
woman
as
she
looks
up
questioning
from
the
gloom
of
the
inner
place
is
there
a
room
signora
she
looks
at
me
with
a
pale
cold
blue
eye
and
shouts
into
the
dark
for
somebody
then
she
advances
into
the
passage
and
looks
us
up
and
down
the
and
me
are
you
husband
and
wife
she
demands
challenge
yes
how
should
we
be
say
i
a
tiny
maid
of
about
thirteen
but
sturdy
and
has
appeared
in
answer
to
the
shout
take
them
to
number
seven
says
the
old
dame
and
she
turns
back
to
her
gloom
and
seizes
the
flat
iron
grimly
we
follow
up
two
flights
of
cold
stone
stairs
disheartening
narrow
staircase
with
a
cold
iron
rail
and
corridors
opening
off
gloomily
and
rather
disorderly
these
houses
give
the
effect
inside
of
never
having
been
properly
finished
as
if
long
long
ago
the
inmates
had
crowded
in
fashion
without
waiting
for
anything
to
be
brought
into
order
and
there
it
had
been
left
dreary
and
chaotic
thumbelina
the
little
maid
threw
open
the
door
of
number
seven
with
and
we
both
exclaimed
how
fine
it
seemed
to
us
palatial
two
good
thick
white
beds
a
table
a
chest
of
drawers
two
mats
on
the
tiled
floor
and
gorgeous
oleographs
on
the
wall
and
two
good
side
by
side
and
all
perfectly
clean
and
nice
what
were
we
coming
to
we
felt
we
ought
to
be
impressed
we
pulled
open
the
latticed
window
doors
and
looked
down
on
the
street
the
only
street
and
it
was
a
river
of
noisy
life
a
band
was
playing
rather
terribly
round
the
corner
at
the
end
and
up
and
down
the
street
jigged
endless
numbers
of
maskers
in
their
carnival
costume
with
girls
and
young
women
strolling
to
participate
and
how
frisky
they
all
were
how
bubbly
and
the
maskers
were
nearly
all
women
the
street
was
full
of
women
so
we
thought
at
first
then
we
saw
looking
closer
that
most
of
the
women
were
young
men
dressed
up
all
the
maskers
were
young
men
and
most
of
these
young
men
were
masquerading
as
women
as
a
rule
they
did
not
wear
only
little
dominoes
of
black
cloth
or
green
cloth
or
white
cloth
coming
down
to
the
mouth
which
is
much
better
for
the
old
modelled
with
the
lace
frill
the
awful
proboscis
sticking
forward
white
and
ghastly
like
the
beaks
of
such
as
the
old
venice
masks
these
i
think
are
simply
horrifying
and
the
more
modern
faces
are
usually
only
repulsive
while
the
simple
little
pink
with
the
end
of
black
or
green
or
white
cloth
these
just
form
a
human
disguise
it
was
quite
a
game
sorting
out
the
real
women
from
the
false
some
were
easy
they
had
stuffed
their
bosoms
and
stuffed
their
bustles
and
put
on
hats
and
very
various
robes
and
they
minced
along
with
little
jigging
steps
like
little
dolls
that
dangle
from
elastic
and
they
put
their
heads
on
one
side
and
dripped
their
hands
and
danced
up
to
flurry
the
actual
young
ladies
and
sometimes
they
received
a
good
clout
on
the
head
when
they
broke
into
wild
and
violent
gestures
whereat
the
young
ladies
scuffled
wildly
they
were
very
lively
and
but
some
were
more
difficult
every
conceivable
sort
of
woman
was
there
broad
shouldered
and
with
rather
large
feet
the
most
usual
was
the
with
a
very
full
bosom
and
very
full
skirt
and
a
very
downright
bearing
but
one
was
a
widow
in
weeds
drooping
on
the
arm
of
a
robust
daughter
and
one
was
an
ancient
crone
in
a
crochet
and
one
was
in
an
old
skirt
and
blouse
and
apron
with
a
broom
wildly
sweeping
the
street
from
end
to
end
he
was
an
animated
rascal
he
swept
with
very
sarcastic
assiduity
in
front
of
two
in
fur
coats
who
minced
very
importantly
along
he
swept
their
way
very
humbly
facing
them
and
going
backwards
sweeping
and
bowing
whilst
they
advanced
with
their
noses
in
the
air
he
made
his
great
bow
and
they
minced
past
daughters
of
no
doubt
then
he
skipped
with
a
bold
gambolling
flurry
behind
them
and
with
a
perfectly
mad
frenzy
began
to
sweep
after
them
as
if
to
sweep
their
tracks
away
he
swept
so
madly
and
so
blindly
with
his
besom
that
he
swept
on
to
their
heels
and
their
ankles
they
shrieked
and
glowered
round
but
the
blind
sweeper
saw
them
not
he
swept
and
swept
and
pricked
their
thin
silk
ankles
and
they
scarlet
with
indignation
and
rage
gave
hot
skips
like
cats
on
hot
bricks
and
fled
discomfited
forwards
he
bowed
once
more
after
them
and
started
mildly
and
innocently
to
sweep
the
street
a
pair
of
lovers
of
fifty
years
ago
she
in
a
half
crinoline
and
poke
bonnet
and
veil
hanging
on
his
arm
came
very
coyly
past
oh
so
simpering
and
it
took
me
a
long
time
to
be
sure
that
the
girl
was
a
youth
an
old
woman
in
a
long
nightdress
prowled
up
and
down
holding
out
her
candle
and
peering
in
the
street
as
if
for
burglars
she
would
approach
the
young
women
and
put
her
candle
in
their
faces
and
peer
so
hard
as
if
she
suspected
them
of
something
and
they
blushed
and
turned
their
faces
away
and
protested
confusedly
this
old
woman
searched
so
fearfully
in
the
face
of
one
strapping
lass
in
the
pink
and
scarlet
costume
who
looked
for
all
the
world
like
a
bunch
of
red
and
geraniums
with
a
bit
of
white
a
peasant
lass
that
the
latter
in
a
panic
began
to
beat
him
with
her
fist
furiously
quite
aroused
and
he
made
off
running
comically
in
his
long
white
nightdress
there
were
some
really
beautiful
dresses
of
rich
old
brocade
and
some
gleaming
old
shawls
a
shimmer
of
lavender
and
silver
or
of
dark
rich
shot
colours
with
deep
borders
of
white
silver
and
primrose
gold
very
lovely
i
believe
two
of
them
were
actual
women
but
the
says
no
there
was
a
victorian
gown
of
thick
green
silk
with
a
creamy
blotched
shawl
about
her
we
both
were
doubtful
there
were
two
wistful
sisters
all
in
white
with
big
feet
and
there
was
a
very
successful
tall
miss
in
a
narrow
of
black
satin
and
a
toque
with
ospreys
the
way
she
minced
and
wagged
her
posterior
and
went
on
her
toes
and
peered
over
her
shoulder
and
kept
her
elbows
in
was
an
admirable
caricature
especially
the
curious
sagging
heaving
movement
of
bustle
region
a
movement
very
characteristic
of
modern
feminism
was
hit
off
with
a
bit
of
male
exaggeration
which
rejoiced
me
at
first
she
even
took
me
in
we
stood
outside
our
window
and
leaned
on
the
little
balcony
rail
looking
down
at
this
flow
of
life
directly
opposite
was
the
house
facing
our
window
the
best
bedroom
of
the
chemist
with
a
huge
white
matrimonial
bed
and
muslin
curtains
in
the
balcony
sat
the
chemist
daughters
very
elegant
in
shoes
and
black
hair
done
in
the
fluffy
fashion
with
a
big
sweep
sideways
oh
very
elegant
they
eyed
us
a
little
and
we
eyed
them
but
without
interest
the
river
of
life
was
down
below
it
was
very
cold
and
the
day
was
declining
we
too
were
cold
we
decided
to
go
into
the
street
and
look
for
the
café
in
a
moment
we
were
out
of
doors
walking
as
inconspicuously
as
possible
near
the
wall
of
course
there
was
no
pavement
these
maskers
were
very
gentle
and
whimsical
no
touch
of
brutality
at
all
now
we
were
level
with
them
how
odd
and
funny
they
were
one
youth
wore
a
thin
white
blouse
and
a
pair
of
his
sister
wide
calico
knickers
with
needlework
frills
near
the
ankle
and
white
stockings
he
walked
artlessly
and
looked
almost
pretty
only
the
winced
with
pain
not
because
of
the
knickers
but
because
of
that
awful
length
coming
well
below
the
knee
another
young
man
was
wound
into
a
sheet
and
heavens
knows
if
he
could
ever
get
out
of
it
another
was
involved
in
a
complicated
entanglement
of
white
crochet
antimacassars
very
troublesome
to
contemplate
i
did
not
like
him
at
all
like
a
fish
in
a
net
but
he
strode
robustly
about
we
came
to
the
end
of
the
street
where
there
is
a
wide
desolate
sort
of
gap
here
the
little
band
stood
braying
away
there
was
a
thick
crowd
of
people
and
on
a
slanting
place
just
above
a
little
circle
where
youths
and
men
maskers
and
one
or
two
girls
were
dancing
so
crowded
together
and
such
a
small
ring
that
they
looked
like
a
jiggly
set
of
upright
rollers
all
turning
rickettily
against
one
another
they
were
doing
a
sort
of
intense
jigging
waltz
why
do
they
look
so
intense
perhaps
because
they
were
so
tight
all
together
like
too
many
fish
in
a
globe
slipping
through
one
another
there
was
a
café
in
this
sort
of
piazza
not
a
piazza
at
all
a
formless
gap
but
young
men
were
drinking
little
drinks
and
i
knew
it
would
be
hopeless
to
ask
for
anything
but
cold
drinks
or
black
coffee
which
we
did
not
want
so
we
continued
forwards
up
the
slope
of
the
village
street
these
towns
soon
come
to
an
end
already
we
were
wandering
into
the
open
on
a
ledge
above
a
peasant
family
was
making
a
huge
bonfire
a
tower
of
rippling
flame
little
impish
boys
were
throwing
on
more
rubbish
everybody
else
was
in
town
why
were
these
folk
at
the
making
this
fire
alone
we
came
to
the
end
of
the
houses
and
looked
over
the
at
the
hollow
deep
interesting
valley
below
away
on
the
other
side
rose
a
blue
mountain
a
steep
but
stumpy
cone
high
land
reared
up
dusky
and
all
around
somewhere
far
off
the
sun
was
setting
with
a
bit
of
crimson
it
was
a
wild
unusual
landscape
of
unusual
shape
the
hills
seemed
so
untouched
the
hollow
cradle
of
the
valley
was
cultivated
like
a
tapestry
away
below
and
there
seemed
so
little
outlying
life
nothing
no
castles
even
in
italy
and
sicily
castles
perching
everywhere
in
sardinia
none
the
remote
ungrappled
hills
rising
darkly
standing
outside
of
life
as
we
went
back
it
was
growing
dark
and
the
little
band
was
about
to
leave
off
its
brass
noise
but
the
crowd
still
surged
the
maskers
still
jigged
and
frisked
unweariedly
oh
the
good
old
energy
of
the
bygone
days
before
men
became
so
here
it
was
still
on
the
hop
we
found
no
café
that
looked
any
good
coming
to
the
inn
we
asked
if
there
was
a
fire
anywhere
there
was
we
went
up
to
our
room
the
had
lighted
up
opposite
one
saw
their
bedroom
as
if
it
were
one
own
in
the
dusk
of
the
street
the
maskers
were
still
jigging
all
the
youths
still
joyfully
being
women
but
a
little
more
roughly
now
away
over
the
the
of
a
dying
sunset
and
it
was
very
cold
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
just
to
lie
in
bed
the
made
a
little
tea
on
the
and
we
sat
in
bed
and
sipped
it
then
we
covered
ourselves
up
and
lay
still
to
get
warm
outside
the
noise
of
the
street
came
unabated
it
grew
quite
dark
the
lights
reflected
into
the
room
there
was
the
sound
of
an
accordion
across
the
hoarseness
of
the
many
voices
and
movements
in
the
street
and
then
a
solid
strong
singing
of
men
voices
singing
a
soldier
song
quando
torniamo
in
casa
nostra
we
got
up
to
look
under
the
small
electric
lights
the
narrow
cobbled
street
was
still
running
with
a
river
of
people
but
fewer
maskers
two
maskers
beating
loudly
at
a
heavy
closed
door
they
beat
and
beat
at
last
the
door
opens
a
crack
they
rush
to
try
to
get
in
but
in
vain
it
had
shut
the
moment
it
saw
them
they
are
foiled
on
they
go
down
the
street
the
town
is
full
of
men
many
peasants
come
in
from
the
outlying
parts
the
black
and
white
costume
now
showing
in
the
streets
we
retire
to
bed
again
out
of
the
cold
comes
a
knock
and
thumbelina
bursts
in
in
the
darkness
siamo
qua
says
the
thumbelina
dashes
at
the
and
shuts
them
and
shuts
the
casement
then
she
dashes
to
my
bedhead
and
turns
on
the
light
looking
down
at
me
as
if
i
were
a
rabbit
in
the
grass
then
she
flings
a
can
of
water
against
the
cold
water
icy
alas
after
which
small
and
explosive
she
explodes
her
way
out
of
the
room
again
and
leaves
us
in
the
glaring
light
having
replied
that
it
is
now
a
little
after
six
and
dinner
is
half
past
seven
so
we
lie
in
bed
warm
and
in
peace
but
hungry
waiting
for
half
past
seven
when
the
can
stand
it
no
more
she
flounces
up
though
the
clock
from
the
campanile
has
struck
seven
only
a
few
minutes
before
dashing
downstairs
to
reconnoitre
she
is
back
in
a
breath
to
say
that
people
are
eating
their
heads
off
in
the
long
dining
room
in
the
next
breath
we
are
downstairs
too
the
room
was
brightly
lighted
and
at
many
white
tables
sat
diners
all
men
it
was
quite
everyone
was
in
convivial
mood
the
spied
men
opposite
having
chicken
and
salad
and
she
had
hopes
but
they
were
brief
when
the
soup
came
the
girl
announced
that
there
was
only
bistecca
which
meant
a
bit
of
fried
cow
so
it
did
a
quite
quite
small
bit
of
fried
beef
a
few
potatoes
and
a
bit
of
cauliflower
really
it
was
not
enough
for
a
child
of
twelve
but
that
was
the
end
of
it
a
few
mandarini
tangerine
oranges
rolled
on
a
plate
for
dessert
and
there
the
long
and
short
of
these
infernal
dinners
was
there
any
cheese
no
there
was
no
cheese
so
we
merely
masticated
bread
there
came
in
three
peasants
in
the
black
and
white
costume
and
sat
at
the
middle
table
they
kept
on
their
stocking
caps
and
queer
they
looked
coming
in
with
slow
deliberate
tread
of
these
elderly
men
and
sitting
rather
remote
with
a
gap
of
solitude
around
them
the
peculiar
ancient
loneliness
of
the
sardinian
hills
clings
to
them
and
something
stiff
static
all
the
men
at
our
end
of
the
room
were
citizens
employees
of
some
sort
and
they
were
all
acquaintances
a
large
dog
very
large
indeed
with
a
great
muzzle
padded
slowly
from
table
to
table
and
looked
at
us
with
big
wistful
topaz
eyes
when
the
meal
was
almost
over
our
and
conductor
came
in
looking
faint
with
hunger
and
cold
and
fatigue
they
were
quartered
at
this
house
they
had
eaten
nothing
since
the
at
gavoi
in
a
very
short
time
they
were
through
their
portions
and
was
there
nothing
else
nothing
but
they
were
half
starved
they
ordered
two
eggs
each
in
padella
i
ordered
coffee
and
asked
them
to
come
and
take
it
with
us
and
a
brandy
so
they
came
when
their
eggs
were
finished
a
diversion
was
now
created
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
the
red
wine
which
is
good
in
sardinia
had
been
drunk
freely
directly
facing
us
sat
a
rather
stout
man
with
pleasant
blue
eyes
and
a
nicely
shaped
head
dressed
like
any
other
town
man
on
a
sunday
the
dog
had
waddled
up
to
him
and
sat
down
statuesque
in
front
of
him
and
the
fat
man
being
mellow
began
to
play
with
the
big
gentle
brindled
animal
he
took
a
piece
of
bread
and
held
it
before
the
dog
nose
and
the
dog
tried
to
take
it
but
the
man
like
a
boy
now
he
was
ripe
with
wine
put
the
mastiff
back
with
a
restraining
finger
and
told
him
not
to
snatch
then
he
proceeded
with
a
little
conversation
with
the
animal
the
dog
again
tried
to
snatch
gently
and
again
the
man
started
saved
the
bread
and
startled
the
dog
which
backed
and
gave
a
sharp
sad
yelp
as
if
to
say
why
do
you
tease
me
now
said
the
man
you
are
not
to
snatch
come
here
come
here
vieni
qua
and
he
held
up
the
piece
of
bread
the
animal
came
near
now
said
the
man
i
put
this
bread
on
your
nose
and
you
do
move
un
ha
the
dog
had
tried
to
snatch
the
bread
the
man
had
shouted
and
jerked
it
away
the
animal
had
recoiled
and
given
another
expostulating
yelp
the
game
continued
all
the
room
was
watching
smiling
the
dog
did
not
understand
at
all
it
came
forward
again
troubled
the
man
held
the
bread
near
its
nose
and
held
up
a
warning
finger
the
beast
dropped
its
head
mournfully
cocking
up
its
eye
at
the
bread
with
varied
feelings
now
said
the
man
not
until
i
say
three
due
the
dog
could
bear
it
no
longer
the
man
in
jerking
let
go
the
bread
and
yelled
at
the
top
of
his
voice
tre
the
dog
gulped
the
piece
of
bread
with
a
resigned
pleasure
and
the
man
pretended
it
had
all
happened
properly
on
the
word
three
so
he
started
again
vieni
qua
vieni
qua
the
dog
which
had
backed
away
with
the
bread
came
hesitating
cringing
forward
dropping
its
in
doubt
as
dogs
do
advancing
towards
the
new
nugget
of
bread
the
man
preached
it
a
little
sermon
you
sit
there
and
look
at
this
bread
i
sit
here
and
look
at
you
and
i
hold
this
bread
and
you
stop
still
and
i
stop
still
while
i
count
three
now
then
uno
the
dog
could
bear
these
numerals
with
their
awful
slowness
he
snatched
desperately
the
man
yelled
and
lost
the
bread
the
dog
gulping
turned
to
creep
away
then
it
began
again
come
here
come
here
did
i
tell
thee
i
would
count
three
già
i
said
i
would
count
three
not
one
but
three
and
to
count
three
you
need
three
numbers
ha
steady
three
numbers
uno
due
e
tre
the
last
syllables
were
yelled
so
that
the
room
rang
again
the
dog
gave
a
mournful
howl
of
excitement
missed
the
bread
groped
for
it
and
fled
the
man
was
red
with
excitement
his
eyes
shining
he
addressed
the
company
at
large
i
had
a
dog
he
said
ah
a
dog
and
i
would
put
a
piece
of
bread
on
his
nose
and
say
a
verse
and
he
looked
at
me
so
the
man
put
his
face
sideways
and
he
looked
at
me
he
gazed
up
under
his
brows
and
he
talked
to
me
so
o
zieu
zieu
but
he
never
moved
no
he
never
moved
if
he
sat
with
that
bread
on
his
nose
for
half
an
hour
and
if
tears
ran
down
his
face
he
never
moved
not
till
i
said
then
ah
the
man
tossed
up
his
face
snapped
the
air
with
his
mouth
and
gulped
an
imaginary
crust
ah
that
dog
was
trained
the
man
of
forty
shook
his
head
vieni
qua
come
here
tweet
come
here
he
patted
his
fat
knee
and
the
dog
crept
forward
the
man
held
another
piece
of
bread
now
he
said
to
the
dog
listen
listen
i
am
going
to
tell
you
something
il
soldato
va
alla
guerra
no
no
not
yet
when
i
say
il
soldato
va
alla
guerra
mangia
male
dorme
in
terra
listen
be
still
quiet
now
uno
due
e
tre
it
came
out
in
one
simultaneous
yell
from
the
man
the
dog
in
sheer
bewilderment
opened
his
jaws
and
let
the
bread
go
down
his
throat
and
wagged
his
tail
in
agitated
misery
ah
said
the
man
you
are
learning
come
come
here
come
now
then
now
you
know
so
so
look
at
me
so
the
stout
man
of
forty
bent
forward
his
face
was
flushed
the
veins
in
his
neck
stood
out
he
talked
to
the
dog
and
imitated
the
dog
and
very
well
indeed
he
reproduced
something
of
the
big
gentle
wistful
subservience
of
the
animal
the
dog
was
his
totem
the
affectionate
hound
so
he
started
the
rigmarole
again
we
put
it
into
english
listen
now
listen
let
me
tell
it
you
so
the
soldier
goes
to
the
war
his
food
is
rotten
he
sleeps
on
the
floor
now
now
no
you
are
not
keeping
quiet
now
now
il
soldate
va
alla
guerra
mangia
male
dorme
in
terra
the
verses
known
to
every
italian
were
sung
out
in
a
fashion
the
audience
listened
as
one
man
or
as
one
child
the
rhyme
chiming
in
every
heart
they
waited
with
excitement
for
the
one
two
and
three
the
last
two
words
were
always
ripped
out
with
a
tearing
yell
i
shall
never
forget
the
force
of
those
syllables
e
tre
but
the
dog
made
a
poor
show
he
only
gobbled
the
bread
and
was
uneasy
this
game
lasted
us
a
full
hour
a
full
hour
by
the
clock
sat
the
whole
room
in
intense
silence
watching
the
man
and
the
dog
our
friends
told
us
the
man
was
the
their
inspector
but
they
liked
him
un
brav
uomo
un
bravo
uomo
eh
si
perhaps
they
were
a
little
uneasy
seeing
him
in
his
cups
and
hearing
him
yell
so
nakedly
and
three
we
talked
rather
sadly
wistfully
young
people
especially
nice
ones
like
the
driver
are
too
sad
and
serious
these
days
the
little
conductor
made
big
brown
eyes
at
us
wistful
too
and
sad
we
were
going
for
in
the
morning
they
were
driving
back
again
to
sorgono
over
the
old
road
and
we
were
going
on
to
terranova
the
port
but
we
promised
to
come
back
in
the
summer
when
it
was
warmer
then
we
should
all
meet
again
perhaps
you
will
find
us
on
the
same
course
still
who
knows
said
the
driver
sadly
vii
to
terranova
and
the
steamer
the
morning
was
very
clear
and
blue
we
were
up
betimes
the
old
dame
of
the
inn
very
friendly
this
morning
we
were
going
already
oh
but
we
had
stayed
long
in
nuoro
did
we
like
it
yes
we
like
it
we
would
come
back
in
the
summer
when
it
was
warmer
ah
yes
she
said
artists
came
in
the
summer
yes
she
agreed
nuoro
was
a
nice
place
molto
and
really
it
is
and
really
she
was
an
awfully
nice
capable
human
old
woman
and
i
had
thought
her
a
beldame
when
i
saw
her
ironing
she
gave
us
good
coffee
and
milk
and
bread
and
we
went
out
into
the
town
there
was
the
real
monday
morning
atmosphere
of
an
old
provincial
town
the
vacant
feeling
of
work
resumed
after
sunday
rather
reluctantly
nobody
buying
anything
nobody
quite
at
grips
with
anything
the
doors
of
the
shops
stood
open
in
nuoro
they
have
hardly
reached
the
stage
of
one
must
go
inside
into
the
dark
caves
to
see
what
the
goods
are
near
the
doorways
of
the
drapers
shops
stood
rolls
of
that
fine
scarlet
cloth
for
the
women
costumes
in
a
large
tailor
window
four
women
sat
sewing
tailoring
and
looking
out
of
the
window
with
eyes
still
and
mischievous
detached
men
some
in
the
black
and
white
stood
at
the
street
corners
as
if
obstinately
avoiding
the
current
of
work
having
had
a
day
off
the
salt
taste
of
liberty
still
lingering
on
their
lips
they
were
not
going
to
be
dragged
so
easily
back
into
harness
i
always
sympathise
with
these
rather
sulky
forlorn
males
who
insist
on
making
another
day
of
it
it
shows
a
spark
of
spirit
still
holding
out
against
our
world
there
is
nothing
to
see
in
nuoro
which
to
tell
the
truth
is
always
a
relief
sights
are
an
irritating
bore
thank
heaven
there
is
a
bit
of
perugino
or
anything
pisan
in
the
place
that
i
know
of
happy
is
the
town
that
has
nothing
to
show
what
a
lot
of
stunts
and
affectations
it
saves
life
is
then
life
not
one
could
saunter
along
the
rather
inert
narrow
street
and
see
the
women
having
a
bit
of
a
gossip
and
see
an
old
crone
with
a
basket
of
bread
on
her
head
and
see
the
unwilling
ones
hanging
back
from
work
and
the
whole
current
of
industry
disinclined
to
flow
life
is
life
and
things
are
things
i
am
sick
of
gaping
even
peruginos
i
have
had
my
thrills
from
carpaccio
and
botticelli
but
now
i
had
enough
but
i
can
always
look
at
an
old
peasant
in
his
earthy
white
drawers
and
his
black
wearing
no
coat
or
but
just
crooking
along
beside
his
little
i
am
sick
of
things
even
perugino
the
sight
of
the
woman
with
the
basket
of
bread
reminded
us
that
we
wanted
some
food
so
we
searched
for
bread
none
if
you
please
it
was
monday
morning
eaten
out
there
would
be
bread
at
the
forno
the
oven
where
was
the
oven
up
the
road
and
down
a
passage
i
thought
we
should
smell
it
but
no
we
wandered
back
our
friends
had
told
us
to
take
tickets
early
for
perhaps
the
bus
would
be
crowded
so
we
bought
yesterday
pastry
and
little
cakes
and
slices
of
native
sausage
and
still
no
bread
i
went
and
asked
our
old
hostess
there
is
no
fresh
bread
it
has
come
in
yet
she
said
never
mind
give
me
stale
so
she
went
and
rummaged
in
a
drawer
oh
dear
oh
dear
the
women
have
eaten
it
all
but
perhaps
over
there
she
pointed
down
the
street
they
can
give
you
some
they
could
i
paid
the
bill
about
francs
i
think
and
went
out
to
look
for
the
bus
there
it
was
in
a
dark
little
hole
they
gave
me
the
long
to
terranova
they
cost
some
seventy
francs
the
two
the
was
still
vainly
aimlessly
looking
along
the
street
for
bread
ready
when
you
are
said
our
new
driver
rather
snappily
he
was
a
pale
young
man
with
brown
eyes
and
fair
ginger
hair
so
in
we
clambered
waved
farewell
to
our
old
friends
whose
bus
was
ready
to
roll
away
in
the
opposite
direction
as
we
bumped
past
the
piazza
i
saw
velveteens
standing
there
isolate
and
still
apparently
scowling
with
unabated
irritation
i
am
sure
he
has
money
why
the
first
class
yesterday
otherwise
and
i
sure
married
him
because
he
is
a
townsman
with
property
out
we
rolled
on
our
last
sardinian
drive
the
morning
was
of
a
beauty
blue
and
very
lovely
below
on
the
right
stretched
the
concave
valley
tapestried
with
cultivation
up
into
the
morning
light
rose
the
high
humanless
hills
with
wild
treeless
but
there
was
no
glass
in
the
left
window
of
the
and
the
wind
came
howling
in
cold
enough
i
stretched
myself
on
the
front
seat
the
screwed
herself
into
a
corner
and
we
watched
the
land
flash
by
how
well
this
new
man
drove
the
freckled
one
with
his
gloomy
brown
eyes
how
cleverly
he
changed
gear
so
that
the
automobile
mewed
and
purred
comfortably
like
a
live
thing
enjoying
itself
and
how
dead
he
was
to
the
rest
of
the
world
wrapped
in
his
gloom
like
a
young
hamlet
his
answers
to
his
mate
were
monosyllabic
or
just
no
answers
at
all
he
was
one
of
those
responsible
capable
morose
souls
who
do
their
work
with
silent
perfection
and
look
as
if
they
were
driving
along
the
brink
of
doom
say
a
word
to
them
and
they
go
over
the
edge
but
gentle
of
course
fiction
used
to
be
fond
of
them
a
sort
of
young
mechanic
rochester
who
has
even
lost
the
jane
illusion
perhaps
it
was
not
fair
to
watch
him
so
closely
from
behind
his
mate
was
a
bit
of
a
bounder
with
one
of
those
rakish
military
caps
whose
soft
tops
cock
sideways
or
backwards
he
was
in
italian
khaki
and
puttees
he
smoked
his
cigarette
bounderishly
but
at
the
same
time
with
peculiar
gentleness
he
handed
one
to
the
ginger
hamlet
hamlet
accepted
it
and
his
mate
held
him
a
light
as
the
bus
swung
on
they
were
like
man
and
wife
the
mate
was
the
alert
and
jane
eyre
whom
the
ginger
rochester
was
not
going
to
spoil
in
a
hurry
the
landscape
was
different
from
yesterday
as
we
dropped
down
the
shallow
winding
road
from
nuoro
quite
quickly
the
moors
seemed
to
spread
on
either
side
treeless
bushy
rocky
desert
how
hot
they
must
be
in
summer
one
knows
from
grazia
deledda
books
a
pony
with
a
low
trap
was
prancing
unhappily
in
the
we
slowed
down
and
slid
harmlessly
past
then
again
on
we
whizzed
down
the
looped
road
which
turned
back
on
itself
as
sharply
as
a
snake
that
has
been
wounded
hamlet
darted
the
bus
at
the
curves
then
softly
padded
round
like
an
angel
then
off
again
for
the
next
parabola
we
came
out
into
wide
rather
desolate
moorland
valley
spaces
with
low
rocks
away
to
the
left
and
steep
slopes
on
the
right
sometimes
groups
of
men
were
working
in
the
forlorn
distances
a
woman
in
the
madder
costume
led
a
panniered
ass
along
the
wastes
the
sun
shone
magnificently
already
it
was
hotter
here
the
landscape
had
quite
changed
these
slopes
looked
east
and
south
to
the
sea
they
were
and
the
first
stop
was
where
a
wild
rough
lane
came
down
the
hill
to
our
road
at
the
corner
stood
a
lonely
house
and
in
the
the
most
battered
old
carriage
i
have
ever
seen
the
jaunty
mate
sorted
out
the
post
the
boy
with
the
brown
carriage
and
brown
pony
signed
the
book
as
we
all
stood
in
the
roadway
there
was
a
little
wait
for
a
man
who
was
fetching
up
another
parcel
the
and
parcels
from
the
tattered
carriage
were
received
and
stowed
and
signed
for
we
walked
up
and
down
in
the
sun
to
get
warm
the
landscape
was
wild
and
open
round
about
pip
goes
rochester
peremptorily
at
the
horn
amazing
how
obediently
we
scuffle
in
away
goes
the
bus
rushing
towards
the
sea
already
one
felt
that
peculiar
glare
in
the
heavens
that
intensification
of
the
light
in
the
lower
sky
which
is
caused
by
the
sea
to
sunward
away
in
front
three
girls
in
brown
costume
are
walking
along
the
side
of
the
white
going
with
panniers
towards
a
village
up
a
slight
incline
they
hear
us
turn
round
and
instantly
go
off
their
heads
exactly
like
chickens
in
the
road
they
fly
towards
us
crossing
the
road
and
swifter
than
any
rabbits
they
scuttle
one
after
another
into
a
deep
like
a
deep
ditch
at
right
angles
to
the
road
there
as
we
roll
past
they
are
all
crouched
peering
out
at
us
fearfully
like
creatures
from
their
hole
the
bus
mate
salutes
them
with
a
shout
and
we
roll
on
towards
the
village
on
the
low
summit
it
is
a
small
stony
place
of
poor
people
we
roll
on
to
a
standstill
there
is
a
group
of
poor
people
the
women
wear
the
costume
and
again
the
bolero
has
changed
shape
it
is
a
rather
fantastic
low
corset
curiously
shapen
and
originally
apparently
made
of
wonderful
elaborate
brocade
but
look
at
it
now
there
is
an
altercation
because
a
man
wants
to
get
into
the
bus
with
two
little
black
pigs
each
of
which
is
wrapped
in
a
little
sack
with
its
face
and
ears
appearing
like
a
flower
from
a
wrapped
bouquet
he
is
told
that
he
must
pay
the
fare
for
each
pig
as
if
it
were
a
christian
del
mondo
a
pig
a
little
pig
and
paid
for
as
if
it
were
a
christian
he
dangles
the
one
from
each
hand
and
the
little
pigs
open
their
black
mouths
and
squeal
with
appreciation
of
the
excitement
they
are
causing
benedetto
it
is
a
chorus
but
the
bus
mate
is
inexorable
every
animal
even
if
it
were
a
mouse
must
be
paid
for
and
have
a
ticket
as
if
it
were
a
christian
the
recoils
stupified
with
indignation
a
under
each
arm
how
much
do
you
charge
for
the
fleas
you
carry
asks
a
sarcastic
youth
a
woman
sitting
sewing
a
soldier
tunic
into
a
little
jacket
for
her
urchin
and
thus
beating
the
sword
into
a
ploughshare
stitches
unconcernedly
in
the
sun
but
rather
slatternly
damsels
giggle
the
speechless
with
fury
slings
the
like
two
bottles
one
on
either
side
the
saddle
of
the
ass
whose
halter
is
held
by
a
grinning
but
also
malevolent
girl
malevolent
against
that
is
the
pigs
looking
abroad
from
their
new
situation
squeal
the
eternal
against
an
insufferable
humanity
andiamo
andiamo
says
ginger
rochester
in
his
quiet
but
intense
voice
the
scrambles
up
and
we
charge
once
more
into
the
strong
light
to
seaward
in
we
roll
into
orosei
a
dilapidated
little
town
not
far
from
the
sea
we
descend
in
piazza
there
is
a
great
false
baroque
façade
to
a
church
up
a
wavering
vast
mass
of
steps
and
at
the
side
a
wonderful
jumble
of
roundnesses
with
a
jumble
of
round
tiled
roofs
peaked
in
the
centre
it
must
have
been
some
sort
of
convent
but
it
is
eminently
what
they
call
a
painter
bit
that
pallid
big
baroque
face
at
the
top
of
the
slow
incline
and
the
very
curious
dark
building
at
the
side
of
it
with
its
several
round
roofs
like
pointed
hats
at
varying
altitudes
the
whole
space
has
a
strange
spanish
look
neglected
arid
yet
with
a
bigness
and
a
dilapidated
dignity
and
a
stoniness
which
carry
one
back
to
the
middle
ages
when
life
was
violent
and
orosei
was
no
doubt
a
port
and
a
considerable
place
probably
it
had
bishops
illustration
nuoro
the
sun
came
hot
into
the
wide
piazza
with
its
pallid
heavy
façade
up
on
the
stony
incline
on
one
side
and
arches
and
a
dark
great
courtyard
and
outer
of
some
unknown
building
away
on
the
other
the
road
entering
from
the
inland
and
dropping
out
below
to
the
and
with
the
impression
that
once
some
single
power
had
had
the
place
in
grip
had
given
this
centre
an
architectural
unity
and
splendour
now
lost
and
forgotten
orosei
was
truly
fascinating
but
the
inhabitants
were
churlish
we
went
into
a
sort
of
very
primitive
and
asked
for
bread
bread
alone
said
the
churl
if
you
please
there
is
any
he
answered
oh
where
can
we
get
some
then
you
ca
get
any
really
and
we
could
people
stood
about
glum
not
friendly
there
was
a
second
great
automobile
ready
to
set
off
for
tortolì
far
to
the
south
on
the
east
coast
mandas
is
the
railway
junction
both
for
sorgono
and
tortolì
the
two
buses
stood
near
and
communed
we
prowled
about
the
dead
almost
extinct
town
or
call
it
village
then
rochester
began
to
pip
his
horn
peremptorily
so
we
scuffled
in
the
post
was
stowed
away
a
native
in
black
came
running
and
sweating
carrying
an
and
said
we
must
wait
for
his
who
was
a
dozen
yards
away
ginger
rochester
sat
on
his
driver
throne
and
glared
in
the
direction
whence
the
must
come
his
brow
knitted
irritably
his
long
sharp
nose
did
not
promise
much
patience
he
made
the
horn
roar
like
a
but
no
i
going
to
wait
no
longer
said
he
oh
a
minute
a
minute
that
wo
do
us
any
harm
expostulated
his
mate
no
answer
from
the
long
faced
ginger
hamlet
he
sat
statuesque
but
with
black
eyes
looking
daggers
down
the
still
void
road
va
he
murmured
through
closed
lips
and
leaned
forward
grimly
for
the
starting
handle
patience
patience
patience
a
moment
why
cried
the
mate
per
di
dio
cried
the
black
man
simply
sizzling
and
dancing
in
anguish
on
the
road
round
the
which
stood
in
the
dust
do
go
god
love
do
start
he
got
to
catch
the
boat
he
got
to
be
in
rome
tomorrow
he
wo
be
a
second
he
here
he
here
he
here
this
startled
the
driver
he
released
the
handle
and
looked
round
with
dark
and
glowering
eyes
no
one
in
sight
the
few
glum
natives
stood
round
unmoved
thunder
came
into
the
gloomy
dark
eyes
of
the
rochester
absolutely
nobody
in
sight
click
went
his
face
into
a
look
of
almost
seraphic
peace
as
he
pulled
off
the
brakes
we
were
on
an
incline
and
insidiously
oh
most
subtly
the
great
bus
started
to
lean
forwards
and
steal
into
motion
oh
che
what
a
will
you
got
cried
the
mate
clambering
in
to
the
side
of
the
now
rochester
love
of
god
god
yelled
the
seeing
the
bus
melt
forwards
and
gather
momentum
he
put
his
hands
up
as
if
to
arrest
it
and
yelled
in
a
wild
howl
o
beppin
o
but
in
vain
already
we
had
left
the
little
groups
of
onlookers
behind
we
were
rolling
downwards
out
of
the
piazza
had
seized
the
bag
and
was
running
beside
us
in
agony
out
of
the
piazza
we
rolled
rochester
had
not
put
on
the
engines
and
we
were
just
simply
rolling
down
the
gentle
incline
by
the
will
of
god
into
the
dark
we
melted
towards
the
still
invisible
sea
suddenly
a
yell
oo
ahh
è
qua
è
qua
è
qua
è
qua
gasped
four
times
here
and
then
beppin
she
going
she
going
beppin
appeared
a
man
also
in
black
with
a
very
scrubby
chin
and
a
bundle
running
us
on
fat
legs
he
was
perspiring
but
his
face
was
expressionless
and
with
a
sardonic
flicker
of
a
grin
half
of
spite
half
of
relief
rochester
put
on
the
brakes
again
and
we
stopped
in
the
street
a
woman
tottered
up
panting
and
holding
her
breast
now
for
farewells
andiamo
said
rochester
curtly
looking
over
his
shoulder
and
making
his
fine
nose
curl
with
malice
and
instantly
he
took
off
the
brakes
again
the
fat
woman
shoved
beppin
in
gasping
farewells
the
handed
in
the
tottering
behind
and
the
bus
surged
savagely
out
of
orosei
almost
in
a
moment
we
had
left
the
town
on
its
slope
and
there
below
us
was
a
river
winding
through
marshy
flats
to
the
sea
to
where
small
white
surf
broke
on
a
flat
isolated
beach
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
the
river
ran
rapidly
between
stones
and
then
between
belts
of
high
sere
reeds
high
as
a
man
these
tall
reeds
advanced
almost
into
the
slow
horizontal
sea
from
which
stood
up
a
white
glare
of
light
massive
light
over
the
low
mediterranean
quickly
we
came
down
to
the
and
rolled
over
a
bridge
before
us
between
us
and
the
sea
rose
another
hill
almost
like
a
wall
with
a
flat
top
running
horizontal
perfectly
flat
parallel
with
the
a
sort
of
narrow
long
plateau
for
a
moment
we
were
in
the
wide
scoop
of
the
orosei
stood
on
the
bluff
behind
us
away
to
the
right
the
flat
with
the
thick
dead
reeds
met
the
flat
and
shining
sea
river
and
sea
were
one
water
the
waves
rippled
tiny
and
into
the
stream
to
the
left
there
was
great
loveliness
the
bed
of
the
river
curved
upwards
and
inland
and
there
was
cultivation
but
particularly
there
were
noble
almond
trees
in
full
blossom
how
beautiful
they
were
their
pure
silvery
pink
gleaming
so
nobly
like
a
transfiguration
tall
and
perfect
in
that
strange
cradled
parallel
with
the
sea
almond
trees
were
in
flower
beneath
grey
orosei
almond
trees
came
near
the
road
and
we
could
see
the
hot
eyes
of
the
individual
blossoms
almond
trees
stood
on
the
upward
slope
before
us
and
they
had
flowered
in
such
noble
beauty
there
in
that
trough
where
the
sun
fell
magnificent
and
the
whitened
all
the
air
as
with
a
sort
of
they
gleamed
in
their
incandescent
one
could
hardly
see
their
iron
trunks
in
this
weird
valley
but
already
we
had
crossed
and
were
charging
up
the
great
road
that
was
cut
straight
along
the
side
of
the
like
a
stairway
outside
the
side
of
the
house
so
the
bus
turned
southward
to
run
up
this
stairway
slant
to
get
to
the
top
of
the
sea
long
so
we
emerged
and
there
was
the
mediterranean
rippling
against
the
black
rocks
not
so
very
far
away
below
on
our
right
for
once
on
the
long
the
road
turned
due
north
a
long
white
road
running
between
strips
of
moorland
wild
and
bushy
the
sea
was
in
the
near
distance
blue
blue
and
beating
with
light
it
seemed
more
light
than
watery
and
on
the
left
was
the
wide
trough
of
the
valley
where
almond
trees
like
clouds
in
a
wind
seemed
to
poise
upon
the
pale
land
and
beyond
which
orosei
clustered
its
lost
grey
houses
on
the
bluff
oh
wonderful
orosei
with
your
almonds
and
your
reedy
river
throbbing
throbbing
with
light
and
the
sea
nearness
and
all
so
lost
in
a
world
long
gone
by
lingering
as
legends
linger
on
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
it
is
real
it
seems
so
long
since
life
left
it
and
memory
transfigured
it
into
pure
glamour
lost
away
like
a
lost
pearl
on
the
east
sardinian
coast
yet
there
it
is
with
a
few
grumpy
inhabitants
who
wo
even
give
you
a
crust
of
bread
and
probably
there
is
malaria
almost
sure
and
it
would
be
hell
to
have
to
live
there
for
a
month
yet
for
a
moment
that
january
morning
how
wonderful
oh
the
timeless
glamour
of
those
middle
ages
when
men
were
lordly
and
violent
and
shadowed
with
death
timor
mortis
conturbat
me
the
road
ran
along
by
the
sea
above
the
sea
swinging
gently
up
and
down
and
running
on
to
a
hilly
promontory
in
the
distance
there
were
no
high
lands
the
valley
was
left
behind
and
moors
surrounded
us
wild
desolate
uninhabited
and
uninhabitable
moors
sweeping
up
gently
on
the
left
and
finishing
where
the
land
dropped
low
and
clifflike
to
the
sea
on
the
right
no
life
was
now
in
sight
even
no
ship
upon
the
pale
blue
sea
the
great
globe
of
the
sky
was
unblemished
and
royal
in
its
blueness
and
its
ringing
cerulean
light
over
the
moors
a
great
hawk
hovered
rocks
cropped
out
it
was
a
savage
land
forsaken
to
the
sea
and
the
sun
we
were
alone
in
the
the
had
made
one
or
two
sets
at
us
but
he
rather
confused
us
he
was
young
about
or
three
he
was
quite
with
his
rakish
military
cap
and
his
figure
in
military
clothes
but
he
had
dark
eyes
that
seemed
to
ask
too
much
and
his
manner
of
approach
was
abrupt
persistent
and
disconcerting
already
he
had
asked
us
where
we
were
going
where
we
lived
whence
we
came
of
what
nationality
we
were
and
was
i
a
painter
already
he
knew
so
much
further
we
rather
fought
shy
of
him
we
ate
those
pale
nuoro
pastries
they
were
just
flaky
pastry
good
but
with
nothing
inside
but
a
breath
of
air
and
we
gnawed
slices
of
very
nuoro
sausage
and
we
drank
the
tea
and
we
were
very
hungry
for
it
was
past
noon
and
we
had
eaten
as
good
as
nothing
the
sun
was
magnificent
in
heaven
we
rushed
at
a
great
purring
speed
along
that
moorland
road
just
above
the
sea
and
then
the
climbed
in
to
share
the
coupé
with
us
he
put
his
dark
beseeching
and
yet
persistent
eyes
on
us
sat
plumb
in
front
of
us
his
knees
squared
and
began
to
shout
awkward
questions
in
a
strong
curious
voice
of
course
it
was
very
difficult
to
hear
for
the
great
rushing
bus
made
much
noise
we
had
to
try
to
yell
in
our
italian
and
he
was
as
awkward
as
we
were
however
although
it
said
smoking
forbidden
he
offered
us
both
cigarettes
and
insisted
we
should
smoke
with
him
easiest
to
submit
he
tried
to
point
us
out
features
in
the
landscape
but
there
were
none
to
point
except
that
where
the
hill
ran
to
sea
out
of
the
moor
and
formed
a
cape
he
said
there
was
a
house
away
under
the
cliffs
where
coastguards
lived
nothing
else
then
however
he
launched
he
asked
once
more
was
i
english
and
was
the
german
we
said
it
was
so
and
then
he
started
the
old
story
nations
popped
up
and
down
again
like
punch
and
judy
italy
she
had
no
quarrel
with
la
germania
never
had
had
no
no
good
friends
the
two
nations
but
once
the
war
was
started
italy
had
to
come
in
for
why
germany
would
beat
france
occupy
her
lands
march
down
and
invade
italy
best
then
join
the
war
whilst
the
enemy
was
only
invading
somebody
else
territory
they
are
perfectly
naïve
about
it
that
what
i
like
he
went
on
to
say
that
he
was
a
soldier
he
had
served
eight
years
in
the
italian
cavalry
yes
he
was
a
cavalryman
and
had
been
all
through
the
war
but
he
had
not
therefore
any
quarrel
with
germany
no
war
was
war
and
it
was
over
so
let
it
be
over
but
france
la
francia
here
he
sat
forward
on
his
seat
with
his
face
near
ours
and
his
eyes
suddenly
took
a
look
of
quite
irrational
blazing
rage
france
there
was
a
man
in
italy
who
was
dying
to
get
at
the
throat
of
france
france
let
there
be
war
and
every
italian
would
leap
to
arms
even
the
old
even
the
old
i
yes
there
must
be
war
with
france
it
was
coming
it
was
bound
to
come
every
italian
was
waiting
for
it
waiting
to
fly
at
the
french
throat
for
why
why
he
had
served
two
years
on
the
french
front
and
he
knew
why
ah
the
french
for
arrogance
for
insolence
dio
they
were
not
to
be
borne
the
french
they
thought
themselves
lords
of
the
world
del
mondo
lords
of
the
world
and
masters
of
the
world
yes
they
thought
themselves
no
less
and
what
are
they
monkeys
monkeys
not
better
than
monkeys
but
let
there
be
war
and
italy
would
show
them
italy
would
give
them
del
italy
was
pining
for
war
all
all
pining
for
war
with
no
one
with
no
one
but
france
ah
with
no
one
italy
loved
everybody
else
but
france
france
we
let
him
shout
it
all
out
till
he
was
at
the
end
of
it
the
passion
and
energy
of
him
was
amazing
he
was
like
one
possessed
i
could
only
wonder
and
wonder
again
for
it
is
curious
what
fearful
passions
these
pleading
wistful
souls
fall
into
when
they
feel
they
have
been
insulted
it
was
evident
he
felt
he
had
been
insulted
and
he
went
just
beside
himself
but
dear
chap
he
should
speak
so
loudly
for
all
italy
even
the
old
the
bulk
of
italian
men
are
only
too
anxious
to
beat
their
bayonets
into
and
smoke
the
cigarette
of
eternal
and
everlasting
peace
to
coincide
at
all
with
our
friend
yet
there
he
was
raging
at
me
in
the
bus
as
we
dashed
along
the
coast
and
then
after
a
space
of
silence
he
became
sad
again
wistful
and
looked
at
us
once
more
with
those
pleading
brown
eyes
beseeching
beseeching
he
knew
not
what
and
i
sure
i
did
know
perhaps
what
he
really
wants
is
to
be
back
on
a
horse
in
a
cavalry
regiment
even
at
war
but
no
it
comes
out
what
he
thinks
he
wants
when
are
we
going
to
london
and
are
there
many
in
england
many
many
in
america
too
do
they
want
men
in
america
i
say
no
they
have
unemployment
out
there
they
are
going
to
stop
immigration
in
april
or
at
least
cut
it
down
why
he
asks
sharply
because
they
have
their
own
unemployment
problem
and
the
quotes
how
many
millions
of
europeans
want
to
emigrate
to
the
united
states
his
eye
becomes
gloomy
are
all
nations
of
europe
going
to
be
forbidden
he
asks
yes
and
already
the
italian
government
will
give
no
more
passports
for
america
to
emigrants
no
passports
then
you
ca
go
you
ca
go
say
i
by
this
time
his
eagerness
and
his
hot
beseeching
eyes
have
touched
the
she
asks
him
what
he
wants
and
from
his
gloomy
face
it
comes
out
in
a
rap
fuori
to
go
out
of
italy
to
go
out
away
to
go
away
to
go
away
it
has
become
a
craving
a
neurasthenia
with
them
where
is
his
home
his
home
is
at
a
village
a
few
miles
ahead
here
on
this
coast
we
are
coming
to
it
soon
there
is
his
home
and
a
few
miles
inland
from
the
village
he
also
has
a
property
he
also
has
land
but
he
does
want
to
work
it
he
does
want
it
in
fact
he
wo
bother
with
it
he
hates
the
land
he
detests
looking
after
vines
he
even
bring
himself
to
try
any
more
what
does
he
want
then
he
wants
to
leave
italy
to
go
abroad
as
a
chauffeur
again
the
long
beseeching
look
as
of
a
distraught
pleading
animal
he
would
prefer
to
be
the
chauffeur
of
a
gentleman
but
he
would
drive
a
bus
he
would
do
anything
in
england
now
he
has
launched
it
yes
i
say
but
in
england
also
we
have
more
men
than
jobs
still
he
looks
at
me
with
his
beseeching
eyes
so
desperate
too
and
so
young
and
so
full
of
energy
and
so
longing
to
himself
to
devote
himself
or
else
to
go
off
in
an
unreasonable
paroxysm
against
the
french
to
my
horror
i
feel
he
is
believing
in
my
goodness
of
heart
and
as
for
it
is
all
i
can
do
to
own
a
pair
of
boots
so
how
am
i
to
set
about
employing
a
we
have
all
gone
quiet
again
so
at
last
he
climbs
back
and
takes
his
seat
with
the
driver
once
more
the
road
is
still
straight
swinging
on
through
the
moorland
strip
by
the
sea
and
he
leans
to
the
silent
rochester
pleading
again
and
at
length
rochester
edges
aside
and
lets
him
take
the
driving
wheel
and
so
now
we
are
all
in
the
hands
of
our
friend
the
he
drives
not
very
well
it
is
evident
he
is
learning
the
bus
ca
quite
keep
in
the
grooves
of
this
wild
bare
road
and
he
shuts
off
when
we
slip
down
a
hill
and
there
is
a
great
muddle
on
the
upslope
when
he
tries
to
change
gear
but
rochester
sits
squeezed
and
silently
attentive
in
his
corner
he
puts
out
his
hand
and
swings
the
levers
there
is
no
fear
that
he
will
let
anything
go
wrong
i
would
trust
him
to
drive
me
down
the
bottomless
pit
and
up
the
other
side
but
still
the
beseeching
mate
holds
the
steering
wheel
and
on
we
rush
rather
uncertainly
and
hesitatingly
now
and
thus
we
come
to
the
bottom
of
a
hill
where
the
road
gives
a
sudden
curve
my
heart
rises
an
inch
in
my
breast
i
know
he
ca
do
it
and
he
ca
oh
lord
but
the
quiet
hand
of
the
freckled
rochester
takes
the
wheel
we
swerve
on
and
the
gives
up
and
the
driver
resumes
control
but
the
now
feels
at
home
with
us
he
clambers
back
into
the
coupé
and
when
it
is
too
painfully
noisy
to
talk
he
simply
sits
and
looks
at
us
with
brown
pleading
eyes
miles
and
miles
and
miles
goes
this
coast
road
and
never
a
village
once
or
twice
a
sort
of
lonely
and
soldiers
lying
about
by
the
road
but
never
a
halt
everywhere
moorland
and
desert
uninhabited
and
we
are
faint
with
fatigue
and
hunger
and
this
relentless
travelling
when
oh
when
shall
we
come
to
siniscola
where
we
are
due
to
eat
our
midday
meal
oh
yes
says
the
mate
there
is
an
inn
at
siniscola
where
we
can
eat
what
we
like
siniscola
siniscola
we
feel
we
must
get
down
we
must
eat
it
is
past
one
and
the
glaring
light
and
the
rushing
loneliness
are
still
about
us
but
it
is
behind
the
hill
in
front
we
see
the
hill
yes
behind
it
is
siniscola
and
down
there
on
the
beach
are
the
bagni
di
siniscola
where
many
forestieri
strangers
come
in
the
summer
therefore
we
set
high
hopes
on
siniscola
from
the
town
to
the
sea
two
miles
the
bathers
ride
on
asses
sweet
place
and
it
is
coming
near
really
near
there
are
fields
even
stretches
of
moor
fenced
off
there
are
vegetables
in
a
little
field
with
a
stone
wall
there
is
a
strange
white
track
through
the
moor
to
a
forsaken
we
are
near
over
the
brow
of
the
low
hill
and
there
it
is
a
grey
huddle
of
a
village
with
two
towers
there
it
is
we
are
there
over
the
cobbles
we
bump
and
pull
up
at
the
side
of
the
street
this
is
siniscola
and
here
we
eat
we
drop
out
of
the
weary
bus
the
mate
asks
a
man
to
show
us
the
inn
the
man
says
he
wo
muttering
so
a
boy
is
deputed
and
he
consents
this
is
the
welcome
and
i
ca
say
much
for
siniscola
it
is
just
a
narrow
crude
stony
place
hot
in
the
sun
cold
in
the
shade
in
a
minute
or
two
we
were
at
the
inn
where
a
fat
young
man
was
just
dismounting
from
his
brown
pony
and
fastening
it
to
a
ring
beside
the
door
the
inn
did
not
look
promising
the
usual
cold
room
opening
gloomily
on
the
gloomy
street
the
usual
long
table
with
this
time
a
foully
blotched
and
two
young
peasant
madams
in
charge
in
the
brown
costume
rather
sordid
and
with
folded
white
cloths
on
their
heads
the
younger
was
in
attendance
she
was
a
young
hussy
and
would
be
very
queenly
and
cocky
she
held
her
nose
in
the
air
and
seemed
ready
to
jibe
at
any
order
it
takes
one
some
time
to
get
used
to
this
cocky
assertive
behaviour
of
the
young
damsels
the
bearing
of
the
hussies
but
it
is
partly
a
sort
of
crude
defensiveness
and
shyness
partly
it
is
barbaric
or
mistrust
and
partly
without
doubt
it
is
a
tradition
with
sardinian
women
that
they
must
hold
their
own
and
be
ready
to
hit
first
this
young
was
all
hit
she
flounced
her
posterior
round
the
table
planking
down
the
lumps
of
bread
on
the
foul
cloth
with
an
air
of
a
subdued
grin
lurking
somewhere
on
her
face
it
is
not
meant
to
be
offensive
yet
it
is
so
truly
it
is
just
uncouthness
but
when
one
is
tired
and
hungry
we
were
not
the
only
feeders
there
was
the
man
off
the
pony
and
a
sort
of
workman
or
porter
or
dazio
official
with
him
and
a
smart
young
man
and
later
our
hamlet
driver
bit
by
bit
the
young
damsel
planked
down
bread
plates
spoons
glasses
bottles
of
black
wine
whilst
we
sat
at
the
dirty
table
in
uncouth
constraint
and
looked
at
the
hideous
portrait
of
his
reigning
majesty
of
italy
and
at
length
came
the
inevitable
soup
and
with
it
the
sucking
chorus
the
little
at
mandas
had
been
a
good
one
but
the
smart
young
man
in
the
country
beat
him
as
water
clutters
and
slavers
down
a
choky
gutter
so
did
his
soup
travel
upwards
into
his
mouth
with
one
long
sucking
stream
of
noise
intensified
as
the
bits
of
cabbage
found
their
way
through
the
orifice
they
did
all
the
talking
the
young
men
they
addressed
the
curtly
and
disrespectfully
as
if
to
say
what
she
up
to
her
airs
were
finely
thrown
away
still
she
showed
off
what
else
was
there
to
eat
there
was
the
meat
that
had
been
boiled
for
the
soup
we
knew
what
that
meant
i
had
as
lief
eat
the
foot
of
an
old
worsted
stocking
nothing
else
you
sludge
queen
no
what
do
you
want
anything
else
for
beefsteak
what
the
good
of
asking
for
beefsteak
or
any
other
steak
on
a
monday
go
to
the
butcher
and
see
for
yourself
the
hamlet
the
pony
rider
and
the
porter
had
the
faded
and
tired
chunks
of
boiled
meat
the
smart
young
man
ordered
eggs
in
padella
two
eggs
fried
with
a
little
butter
we
asked
for
the
same
the
smart
young
man
got
his
first
and
of
course
they
were
warm
and
liquid
so
he
fell
upon
them
with
a
fork
and
once
he
had
got
hold
of
one
end
of
the
eggs
he
just
sucked
them
up
in
a
prolonged
and
violent
suck
like
a
long
thin
ropy
drink
being
sucked
upwards
from
the
little
pan
it
was
a
genuine
exhibition
then
he
fell
upon
the
bread
with
loud
chews
what
else
was
there
a
miserable
little
common
orange
so
much
for
the
dinner
was
there
cheese
no
but
the
they
are
quite
really
held
a
conversation
in
dialect
with
the
young
men
which
i
did
not
try
to
follow
our
pensive
driver
translated
that
there
cheese
but
it
was
good
so
they
would
offer
it
us
and
the
pony
man
interpolated
that
they
did
like
to
offer
us
anything
that
was
not
of
the
best
he
said
it
in
all
sincerity
after
such
a
meal
this
roused
my
curiosity
so
i
asked
for
the
cheese
whether
or
not
and
it
was
so
bad
after
all
this
meal
cost
fifteen
francs
for
the
pair
of
us
we
made
our
way
back
to
the
bus
through
the
uncouth
men
who
stood
about
to
tell
the
truth
strangers
are
not
popular
nowadays
not
anywhere
everybody
has
a
grudge
against
them
at
first
sight
this
grudge
may
or
may
not
wear
off
on
acquaintance
the
afternoon
had
become
hot
hot
as
an
english
june
and
we
had
various
other
passengers
for
one
a
priest
who
showed
his
teeth
when
he
talked
there
was
not
much
room
in
the
coupé
so
the
goods
were
stowed
upon
the
little
rack
with
the
strength
of
the
sun
and
the
six
or
seven
people
in
it
the
coupé
became
stifling
the
opened
her
window
but
the
priest
one
of
the
loudtalking
sort
said
that
a
draught
was
harmful
very
harmful
so
he
put
it
up
again
he
was
one
of
the
gregarious
sort
a
loud
talker
nervy
really
very
familiar
with
all
the
passengers
and
everything
did
one
harm
male
fa
a
draught
male
fa
molto
è
vero
this
to
all
the
men
from
siniscola
and
they
all
said
yes
yes
the
clambered
into
the
to
take
the
tickets
of
the
passengers
in
the
rotondo
through
the
little
wicket
there
was
great
squeezing
and
shouting
and
reckoning
change
and
then
we
stopped
at
a
halt
and
he
dashed
down
with
the
post
and
the
priest
got
down
for
a
drink
with
the
other
men
the
hamlet
driver
sat
stiff
in
his
seat
he
pipped
the
horn
he
pipped
again
with
decision
men
came
clambering
in
but
it
looked
as
if
the
offensive
priest
would
be
left
behind
the
bus
started
venomously
the
priest
came
running
his
gown
flapping
wiping
his
lips
he
dropped
into
his
seat
with
a
cackling
laugh
showing
his
long
teeth
and
he
said
that
it
was
as
well
to
take
a
drink
to
fortify
the
stomach
to
travel
with
the
stomach
uneasy
did
one
harm
male
fa
male
non
è
vero
chorus
of
yes
the
resumed
his
taking
the
tickets
through
the
little
wicket
thrusting
his
rear
amongst
us
as
he
stood
like
this
down
fell
his
military
overcoat
on
the
head
he
was
filled
with
grief
he
folded
it
and
placed
it
on
the
seat
as
a
sort
of
cushion
for
her
oh
so
gently
and
how
he
would
love
to
devote
himself
to
a
master
and
mistress
he
sat
beside
me
facing
the
and
offered
us
an
acid
drop
we
took
the
acid
drop
he
smiled
with
zealous
yearning
at
the
and
resumed
his
conversations
then
he
offered
us
cigarettes
insisted
on
our
taking
cigarettes
the
priest
with
the
long
teeth
looked
sideways
at
the
seeing
her
smoking
then
he
fished
out
a
long
cigar
bit
it
and
spat
he
was
offered
a
but
no
cigarettes
were
harmful
the
paper
was
bad
for
the
health
oh
very
bad
a
pipe
or
a
cigar
so
he
lit
his
long
cigar
and
spat
large
spits
on
the
floor
continually
beside
me
sat
a
big
rather
but
foolish
man
hearing
me
speak
to
the
he
said
in
confidence
to
the
priest
here
are
two
germans
eh
look
at
them
the
woman
smoking
these
are
a
couple
of
those
that
were
interned
here
sardinia
can
do
without
them
now
germans
in
italy
at
the
outbreak
of
the
war
were
interned
in
sardinia
and
as
far
as
one
hears
they
were
left
very
free
and
happy
and
treated
very
well
the
sardinians
having
been
generous
as
all
proud
people
are
but
now
our
fool
made
a
great
titter
through
the
bus
quite
unaware
that
we
understood
he
said
nothing
offensive
but
that
sort
of
tittering
exultation
of
common
people
who
think
they
have
you
at
a
disadvantage
annoyed
me
however
i
kept
still
to
hear
what
they
would
say
but
it
was
only
trivialities
about
the
germans
having
nearly
all
gone
now
their
being
free
to
travel
their
coming
back
to
sardinia
because
they
liked
it
better
than
germany
oh
yes
they
all
wanted
to
come
back
they
all
wanted
to
come
back
to
sardinia
oh
yes
they
knew
where
they
were
well
off
they
knew
their
own
advantage
sardinia
was
this
that
and
the
other
of
advantageousness
and
the
sardi
were
decent
people
it
is
just
as
well
to
put
in
a
word
on
one
own
behalf
occasionally
as
for
la
germania
she
was
down
down
bassa
what
did
one
pay
for
bread
in
germany
five
francs
a
kilo
my
boy
the
bus
stopped
again
and
they
trooped
out
into
the
hot
sun
the
priest
scuffled
round
the
corner
this
time
not
to
go
round
the
corner
was
no
doubt
harmful
we
waited
a
frown
came
between
the
bus
hamlet
brows
he
looked
and
tired
it
was
about
three
we
had
to
wait
for
a
man
from
a
village
with
the
post
and
he
did
not
appear
i
am
going
i
wo
wait
said
the
driver
wait
wait
a
minute
said
the
mate
pouring
oil
and
he
went
round
to
look
but
suddenly
the
bus
started
with
a
vicious
lurch
the
mate
came
flying
and
hung
on
to
the
footboard
he
had
really
almost
been
left
the
driver
glanced
round
sardonically
to
see
if
he
were
there
the
bus
flew
on
the
mate
shook
his
head
in
deprecation
he
a
bit
the
driver
said
the
a
bit
out
of
temper
ah
poor
chap
said
the
young
mate
leaning
forward
and
making
such
beseeching
eyes
of
hot
tolerance
one
has
to
be
sorry
for
him
persons
like
him
they
suffer
so
much
from
themselves
how
should
one
be
angry
with
them
we
must
have
sympathy
never
was
such
a
language
of
sympathy
as
the
italian
poverino
they
are
never
happy
unless
they
are
sympathising
pityingly
with
somebody
and
i
rather
felt
that
i
was
thrown
in
with
the
who
had
to
be
pitied
for
being
which
did
not
improve
my
temper
however
the
suddenly
sat
on
the
opposite
seat
between
the
priest
and
the
he
turned
over
his
official
note
book
and
began
to
write
on
the
back
cover
very
carefully
in
the
flourishing
italian
hand
then
he
tore
off
what
he
had
written
and
with
a
very
bright
and
zealous
look
he
handed
me
the
paper
saying
you
will
find
me
a
post
in
england
when
you
go
in
the
summer
you
will
find
me
a
place
in
london
as
a
chauffeur
if
i
can
said
i
but
it
is
not
easy
he
nodded
his
head
at
me
with
the
most
complete
bright
confidence
quite
sure
now
that
he
had
settled
his
case
perfectly
on
the
paper
he
had
written
his
name
and
his
address
and
if
anyone
would
like
him
as
chauffeur
they
have
only
to
say
so
on
the
back
of
the
scrap
of
paper
the
inevitable
goodwill
infiniti
e
buon
infinite
good
wishes
and
a
good
journey
i
folded
the
paper
and
put
it
in
my
waistcoat
pocket
feeling
a
trifle
disconcerted
by
my
new
responsibility
he
was
such
a
dear
fellow
and
such
bright
trustful
eyes
this
much
achieved
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
and
the
turned
to
take
a
ticket
of
a
fat
comfortable
man
who
had
got
in
at
the
last
stop
there
was
a
bit
of
flying
conversation
where
are
they
from
asked
the
stupid
man
next
to
me
inclining
his
head
in
our
direction
londra
said
our
friend
with
stern
satisfaction
and
they
have
said
so
often
to
one
another
that
london
is
the
greatest
city
in
the
world
that
now
the
very
word
londra
conveys
it
all
you
should
have
seen
the
blank
look
come
over
the
face
of
the
big
handsome
fellow
on
hearing
that
we
were
citizens
of
the
greatest
city
in
the
world
and
they
understand
italian
he
asked
rather
nipped
sicuro
said
our
friend
scornfully
how
should
they
ah
my
large
neighbour
left
his
mouth
open
for
a
few
moments
and
then
another
sort
of
smile
came
on
to
his
face
he
began
to
peep
at
us
sideways
from
his
brown
eyes
brightly
and
was
henceforth
itching
to
get
into
conversation
with
the
citizens
of
the
world
his
look
of
was
quite
gone
replaced
by
a
look
of
ingratiating
admiration
now
i
ask
you
is
this
to
be
borne
here
i
sit
and
he
talks
and
patronisingly
about
me
and
here
i
sit
and
he
is
glegging
at
me
as
if
he
saw
signs
of
an
aureole
under
my
grey
hat
all
in
ten
minutes
and
just
because
instead
of
i
turn
out
to
be
i
might
as
well
be
a
place
on
a
map
or
a
piece
of
goods
with
a
so
little
perception
of
the
actual
me
so
much
going
by
labels
i
now
could
have
kicked
him
harder
i
would
have
liked
to
say
i
was
ten
times
german
to
see
the
fool
change
his
smirk
again
the
priest
now
chimed
up
that
he
had
been
to
america
he
had
been
to
america
and
hence
he
dreaded
not
the
crossing
from
terranuova
di
sardegna
to
cività
vecchia
for
he
had
crossed
the
great
atlantic
apparently
however
the
natives
had
all
heard
this
song
of
the
raven
before
so
he
spat
largely
on
the
floor
whereupon
the
new
fat
neighbour
asked
him
was
it
true
that
the
catholic
church
was
now
becoming
the
one
church
in
the
united
states
and
the
priest
said
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
the
hot
afternoon
wore
on
the
coast
was
rather
more
inhabited
but
we
saw
practically
no
villages
the
view
was
rather
desolate
from
time
to
time
we
stopped
at
a
canteen
house
from
time
to
time
we
passed
natives
riding
on
their
ponies
and
sometimes
there
was
an
equestrian
exhibition
as
the
rough
strong
little
beasts
reared
and
travelled
rapidly
backwards
away
from
the
horrors
of
our
great
automobile
but
the
male
riders
sat
heavy
and
unshakeable
with
sardinian
male
force
everybody
in
the
bus
laughed
and
we
passed
looking
back
to
see
the
pony
still
corkscrewing
but
in
vain
in
the
middle
of
the
lonely
the
climbed
in
and
out
coming
in
to
sit
near
us
he
was
like
a
dove
which
has
at
last
found
an
olive
bough
to
nest
in
and
we
were
the
olive
bough
in
this
world
of
waste
waters
alas
i
felt
a
broken
reed
but
he
sat
so
serenely
near
us
now
like
a
dog
that
has
found
a
master
the
afternoon
was
declining
the
bus
pelted
on
at
a
great
rate
ahead
we
saw
the
big
lump
of
the
island
of
tavolara
a
magnificient
mass
of
rock
which
fascinated
me
by
its
splendid
weighty
form
it
looks
like
a
headland
for
it
apparently
touches
the
land
there
it
rests
at
the
sea
edge
in
this
lost
afternoon
world
strange
how
this
does
not
belong
to
our
world
as
we
rushed
along
we
saw
steamers
two
steamers
steering
south
and
one
sailing
ship
coming
from
italy
and
instantly
the
steamers
seemed
like
our
own
familiar
world
but
still
this
was
forsaken
forgotten
not
included
it
just
is
not
included
how
tired
one
gets
of
these
long
long
rides
it
seemed
we
should
never
come
up
to
tavolara
but
we
did
we
came
right
near
to
it
and
saw
the
beach
with
the
waves
rippling
undisturbed
saw
the
narrow
waters
between
the
and
the
beach
for
now
the
road
was
down
at
and
we
were
not
very
far
from
terranova
yet
all
seemed
still
forsaken
outside
of
the
world
life
the
sun
was
going
down
very
red
and
strong
away
inland
in
the
bus
all
were
silent
subsiding
into
the
pale
we
charged
along
the
flat
road
down
on
a
plain
now
and
dusk
was
gathering
heavily
over
the
land
we
saw
the
curve
flat
upon
the
plain
it
was
the
harbour
head
we
saw
a
magic
harbour
with
masts
and
dark
land
encircling
a
glowing
basin
we
even
saw
a
steamer
lying
at
the
end
of
a
long
thin
bank
of
land
in
the
shallow
shining
wide
harbour
as
if
wrecked
there
and
this
was
our
steamer
but
no
it
looked
in
the
powerful
glow
of
the
sunset
like
some
lonely
steamer
laid
up
in
some
bay
away
at
spitzbergen
towards
the
north
pole
a
solemn
mysterious
bay
lost
lost
to
mankind
our
came
and
told
us
we
were
to
sit
in
the
bus
till
the
was
done
then
we
should
be
driven
to
the
hotel
where
we
could
eat
and
then
he
would
accompany
us
on
the
town
omnibus
to
the
boat
we
need
not
be
on
board
till
eight
and
now
it
was
something
after
five
so
we
sat
still
while
the
bus
rushed
and
the
road
curved
and
the
view
of
the
weird
harbour
changed
though
the
bare
masts
of
ships
in
a
bunch
still
pricked
the
upper
glow
and
the
steamer
lay
away
out
as
if
wrecked
on
a
and
dark
mysterious
land
with
bunchy
hills
circled
round
dark
blue
and
wintry
in
a
golden
while
the
great
bay
of
water
shone
like
a
mirror
in
we
charged
past
a
railway
along
the
flat
darkening
road
into
a
flat
town
of
dark
houses
on
the
marshy
it
felt
more
like
a
settlement
than
a
town
but
it
was
and
after
bumping
and
rattling
down
a
sombre
uncouth
street
we
came
up
with
a
jerk
at
a
doorway
which
was
the
urchins
mudlarks
were
screaming
for
the
luggage
everybody
got
out
and
set
off
towards
the
sea
the
urchins
carrying
luggage
we
sat
still
till
i
could
bear
it
i
did
not
want
to
stay
in
the
automobile
another
moment
and
i
did
not
i
did
not
want
to
be
accompanied
by
our
friend
to
the
steamer
so
i
burst
out
and
the
followed
she
too
was
relieved
to
escape
the
new
attachment
though
she
had
a
great
for
him
but
in
the
end
one
runs
away
from
much
harder
and
more
precipitately
than
from
one
the
mudlarking
urchins
fell
upon
us
had
we
any
more
luggage
were
we
going
to
the
steamer
i
asked
how
one
went
to
the
steamer
did
one
walk
i
thought
perhaps
it
would
be
necessary
to
row
out
you
go
on
foot
or
in
a
carriage
or
in
an
aeroplane
said
an
impudent
brat
how
far
ten
minutes
could
one
go
on
board
at
once
yes
certainly
so
in
spite
of
the
protests
i
handed
the
sack
to
a
wicked
urchin
to
be
led
she
wanted
us
to
go
alone
but
i
did
not
know
the
way
and
am
wary
of
stumbling
into
entanglements
in
these
parts
i
told
the
who
was
abstract
with
nerve
fatigue
please
to
tell
his
comrade
that
i
would
not
forget
the
commission
and
i
tapped
my
waistcoat
pocket
where
the
paper
lay
over
my
heart
he
briefly
promised
and
we
escaped
we
escaped
any
further
friendship
i
bade
the
lead
me
to
the
telegraph
office
which
of
course
was
quite
remote
from
the
shouldering
the
sack
and
clamouring
for
the
kitchenino
which
the
stuck
to
he
marched
forward
by
his
height
he
was
ten
years
old
by
his
face
with
its
evil
pallor
and
he
was
forty
he
wore
a
soldier
tunic
which
came
nearly
to
his
knees
was
barefoot
and
sprightly
with
that
alert
mudlarking
quickness
which
has
its
advantages
so
we
went
down
a
passage
and
climbed
a
stair
and
came
to
an
office
where
one
would
expect
to
register
births
and
deaths
but
the
urchin
said
it
was
the
no
sign
of
life
peering
through
the
wicket
i
saw
a
fat
individual
seated
writing
in
the
distance
feeble
lights
relieved
the
big
barren
official
spaces
i
wonder
the
fat
official
was
afraid
to
be
up
here
alone
he
made
no
move
i
banged
the
shutter
and
demanded
a
telegraph
blank
his
shoulders
went
up
to
his
ears
and
he
plainly
intimated
his
intention
to
let
us
wait
but
i
said
loudly
to
the
urchin
is
the
telegraph
official
and
the
urchin
said
si
signore
so
the
fat
individual
had
to
come
after
which
considerable
delay
we
set
off
again
the
bus
thank
heaven
had
gone
the
savage
dark
street
was
empty
of
friends
we
turned
away
to
the
harbour
front
it
was
dark
now
i
saw
a
railway
near
at
hand
a
bunch
of
dark
masts
the
steamer
showing
a
few
lights
far
down
at
the
tip
of
a
long
spit
of
land
remote
in
and
so
off
we
went
the
barefoot
urchin
twinkling
a
few
yards
ahead
on
the
road
that
followed
the
spit
of
land
the
spit
was
wide
enough
to
carry
this
road
and
the
railway
on
the
right
was
a
silent
house
apparently
built
on
piles
in
the
harbour
away
far
down
in
front
leaned
our
glimmering
steamer
and
a
little
train
was
shunting
trucks
among
the
low
sheds
beside
it
night
had
fallen
and
the
great
stars
flashed
orion
was
in
the
air
and
his
after
him
we
followed
on
down
the
dark
bar
between
the
silent
lustrous
water
the
harbour
was
smooth
as
glass
and
gleaming
like
a
mirror
hills
came
round
encircling
it
entirely
dark
land
ridging
up
and
lying
away
out
even
to
seaward
one
was
not
sure
which
was
exactly
seaward
the
dark
encircling
of
the
land
seemed
stealthy
the
hills
had
a
remoteness
guarding
the
waters
in
the
silence
perhaps
the
great
mass
away
beyond
was
tavolara
again
it
seemed
like
some
lumpish
berg
guarding
an
arctic
bay
where
ships
lay
dead
illustration
terranova
on
and
on
we
followed
the
urchin
till
the
town
was
left
behind
until
it
also
twinkled
a
few
meagre
lights
out
of
its
low
confused
blackness
at
the
across
the
waters
we
lad
left
the
and
the
settlement
the
urchin
padded
on
only
turning
now
and
again
and
extending
a
thin
eager
hand
toward
the
kitchenino
especially
when
some
men
were
advancing
down
the
railway
he
wanted
it
the
carrying
it
was
a
slur
on
his
prowess
so
the
kitchenino
was
relinquished
and
the
lark
strode
on
satisfied
till
at
last
we
came
to
the
low
sheds
that
squatted
between
the
steamer
and
the
the
lark
led
me
into
one
where
a
was
writing
the
cap
let
me
wait
some
minutes
before
informing
me
that
this
was
the
goods
office
the
ticket
office
was
further
on
the
lark
flew
at
him
and
said
then
you
changed
it
have
you
and
he
led
me
on
to
another
shed
which
was
just
going
to
shut
up
here
they
finally
had
the
condescension
to
give
me
two
tickets
a
hundred
and
fifty
francs
the
two
so
we
followed
the
lark
who
strode
like
scipio
africanus
up
the
gangway
with
the
sack
it
was
quite
a
small
ship
the
steward
put
me
in
number
one
cabin
the
in
number
seven
each
cabin
had
four
berths
consequently
man
and
woman
must
separate
rigorously
on
this
ship
here
was
a
blow
for
the
who
knows
what
italian
female
can
be
however
there
we
were
all
the
cabins
were
down
below
and
all
for
some
mysterious
reason
inside
no
portholes
outside
it
was
hot
and
close
down
below
already
i
pitched
the
sack
on
my
berth
and
there
stood
the
lark
on
the
red
carpet
at
the
door
i
gave
him
three
francs
he
looked
at
it
as
if
it
were
my
he
peered
at
the
paper
in
the
light
of
the
lamp
then
he
extended
his
arm
with
a
gesture
of
superb
insolence
flinging
me
back
my
gold
without
a
word
how
said
i
three
francs
are
quite
enough
three
francs
two
kilometers
and
three
pieces
of
luggage
no
signore
no
five
francs
cinque
franchi
and
averting
his
pallid
old
mudlarking
face
and
flinging
his
hand
out
at
me
he
stood
the
image
of
indignant
repudiation
and
truly
he
was
no
taller
than
my
upper
waistcoat
pocket
the
brat
the
brat
he
was
such
an
actor
and
so
impudent
that
i
wavered
between
wonder
and
amusement
and
a
great
inclination
to
kick
him
up
the
steps
i
decided
not
to
waste
my
energy
being
angry
what
a
beastly
little
boy
what
a
horrid
little
boy
what
a
little
boy
really
a
little
thief
a
little
swindler
i
mused
aloud
swindler
he
quavered
after
me
and
he
was
beaten
swindler
doubled
him
up
that
and
the
quiet
mildness
of
my
tone
of
invocation
now
he
would
have
gone
with
his
three
francs
and
now
in
final
contempt
i
gave
him
the
other
two
he
disappeared
like
a
streak
of
lightning
up
the
gangway
terrified
lest
the
steward
should
come
and
catch
him
at
his
tricks
for
later
on
i
saw
the
steward
send
other
larks
flying
for
demanding
more
than
the
brat
the
question
was
now
the
cabin
for
the
simply
refused
to
entertain
the
idea
of
sharing
a
cabin
with
three
italian
women
who
would
all
be
sick
simply
for
the
fuss
of
it
though
the
sea
was
smooth
as
glass
we
hunted
up
the
steward
he
said
all
the
cabins
had
four
berths
the
second
had
three
but
much
smaller
how
that
was
possible
i
do
know
however
if
no
one
came
he
would
give
us
a
cabin
to
ourselves
the
ship
was
clean
and
civilised
though
very
poky
and
there
we
were
we
went
on
deck
would
we
eat
on
board
asked
another
person
no
we
would
we
went
out
to
a
fourth
little
shed
which
was
a
refreshment
stall
and
bought
bread
and
sardines
and
chocolate
and
apples
then
we
went
on
the
upper
deck
to
make
our
meal
in
a
sheltered
place
i
lit
the
spirit
lamp
and
put
on
water
to
boil
the
water
we
had
taken
from
the
cabin
then
we
sat
down
alone
in
the
darkness
on
a
seat
which
had
its
back
against
the
deck
cabins
now
appropriated
by
the
staff
a
thin
cold
wind
was
travelling
we
wrapped
the
one
plaid
round
us
both
and
snugged
together
waiting
for
the
tea
to
boil
i
could
just
see
the
point
of
the
licking
up
from
where
we
sat
the
stars
were
marvellous
in
the
soundless
sky
so
big
that
one
could
see
them
hanging
and
alone
in
their
own
space
yet
all
the
myriads
particularly
bright
the
and
he
hung
flashing
in
the
lower
night
with
a
power
that
made
me
hold
my
breath
grand
and
powerful
he
sent
out
his
flashes
so
sparkling
that
he
seemed
more
intense
than
any
sun
or
moon
and
from
the
dark
uprising
land
he
sent
his
way
of
light
to
us
across
the
water
a
marvellous
so
all
above
us
the
stars
soared
and
pulsed
over
that
silent
harbour
after
a
long
time
the
water
boiled
and
we
drank
our
hot
tea
and
ate
our
sardines
and
bread
and
bits
of
remaining
nuoro
sausage
sitting
there
alone
in
the
intense
starry
darkness
of
that
upper
deck
i
said
alone
but
no
two
ghoulish
ship
cats
came
howling
at
us
for
the
bits
and
even
when
everything
was
eaten
and
the
thrown
in
the
sea
still
they
circled
and
prowled
and
howled
we
sat
on
resting
under
the
magnificent
deep
heavens
wrapped
together
in
the
old
shepherd
shawl
for
which
i
have
blessed
so
often
a
scottish
friend
half
sheltered
from
the
cold
night
wind
and
recovering
somewhat
from
the
sixty
miles
we
had
done
that
day
as
yet
there
was
nobody
on
the
ship
we
were
the
very
first
at
least
in
the
first
class
above
all
was
silent
and
deserted
below
all
was
and
deserted
but
it
was
a
little
ship
with
accommodation
for
some
thirty
and
forty
passengers
in
the
low
deck
forward
stood
two
rows
of
cattle
eighteen
cattle
they
stood
tied
up
side
by
side
and
quite
motionless
as
if
stupefied
only
two
had
lain
down
the
rest
stood
motionless
with
tails
dropped
and
heads
dropped
as
if
drugged
or
gone
insensible
these
cattle
on
the
ship
fascinated
the
she
insisted
on
going
down
to
them
and
examining
them
minutely
but
there
they
were
stiff
almost
as
noah
ark
cows
what
she
could
not
understand
was
that
they
neither
cried
nor
struggled
motionless
terribly
motionless
in
her
idea
cattle
are
wild
and
indomitable
creatures
she
will
not
realise
the
horrid
strength
of
passivity
and
inertia
which
is
almost
the
preponderant
force
in
domesticated
creatures
men
and
beast
alike
there
are
fowls
too
in
various
coops
flappy
and
agitated
these
at
last
at
about
half
past
seven
the
train
from
the
island
arrived
and
the
people
surged
out
in
a
mass
we
stood
hanging
over
the
end
of
the
upper
deck
looking
down
on
they
poured
in
a
thick
mass
up
the
gangway
with
all
conceivable
sorts
of
luggage
bundles
embroidered
bags
the
lamenting
she
had
not
bought
one
a
sudden
surging
mass
of
people
and
goods
there
are
soldiers
too
but
these
are
lined
upon
the
bit
of
a
quay
to
wait
our
interest
is
to
see
whether
there
will
be
any
more
passengers
coming
up
the
wide
board
which
serves
as
gangway
each
individual
hands
a
ticket
to
the
man
at
the
top
and
is
shooed
away
to
his
own
region
usually
second
class
there
are
three
sorts
of
tickets
green
white
second
and
pink
third
the
passengers
go
aft
the
third
class
go
forward
along
the
passage
past
our
cabins
into
the
steerage
and
so
we
watch
and
watch
the
excited
people
come
on
board
and
divide
nearly
all
are
and
a
great
many
are
women
we
have
seen
a
few
men
but
as
yet
no
women
and
every
hat
with
ospreys
gives
the
a
qualm
for
a
long
time
we
are
safe
the
women
flood
to
the
one
who
is
third
begs
and
beseeches
to
go
with
her
friends
in
the
second
i
am
glad
to
say
without
success
and
then
alas
an
elderly
man
with
a
daughter
they
are
very
respectable
and
pleasant
looking
but
the
wails
i
sure
she
will
be
sick
towards
the
end
come
three
convicts
chained
together
they
wear
the
brownish
striped
homespun
and
do
not
look
evil
they
seem
to
be
laughing
together
not
at
all
in
distress
the
two
young
soldiers
who
guard
them
and
who
have
guns
look
nervous
so
the
convicts
go
forward
to
the
steerage
past
our
cabins
at
last
the
soldiers
are
straightened
up
and
turned
on
board
there
almost
at
once
they
start
making
a
tent
drawing
a
huge
tarpaulin
over
a
cross
rope
in
the
below
us
between
the
first
and
second
class
regions
the
great
tarpaulin
is
pulled
down
well
on
either
side
and
fastened
down
and
it
makes
a
big
dark
tent
the
soldiers
creep
in
and
place
their
bundles
and
now
it
is
the
soldiers
who
fascinate
the
she
hangs
over
the
bar
above
and
peers
in
the
soldiers
arrange
themselves
in
two
rows
they
will
sleep
with
their
heads
on
their
bundles
on
either
side
of
the
tent
the
two
rows
of
feet
coming
together
inwards
but
first
they
must
eat
for
it
is
eight
and
more
out
come
their
suppers
a
whole
roast
fowl
hunks
of
kid
legs
of
lamb
huge
breads
the
fowl
is
dismembered
with
a
in
a
twinkling
and
shared
everything
among
the
soldiers
is
shared
there
they
sit
in
their
with
its
open
ends
crowded
together
and
happy
chewing
with
all
their
might
and
clapping
one
another
on
the
shoulder
lovingly
and
taking
swigs
at
the
wine
bottles
we
envy
them
their
good
food
at
last
all
are
on
board
the
omnibus
has
driven
up
from
town
and
gone
back
a
last
young
lout
dashes
up
in
a
carriage
and
scuffles
aboard
the
crew
begins
to
run
about
the
have
trotted
on
board
with
the
last
bales
and
packages
all
is
stowed
safely
the
steamer
hoots
and
hoots
two
men
and
a
girl
kiss
their
friends
all
round
and
get
off
the
ship
the
night
the
steamer
hoots
the
sheds
have
gone
all
dark
far
off
the
town
twinkles
very
sparsely
all
is
and
so
the
gangway
is
hauled
up
and
the
rope
hawsers
quickly
wound
in
we
are
drifting
away
from
the
quay
side
the
few
watchers
wave
their
white
handkerchiefs
standing
diminutive
and
forlorn
on
the
dark
little
quay
in
the
heart
of
the
dark
deserted
harbour
one
woman
cries
and
waves
and
weeps
a
man
makes
exaggerated
signals
with
his
white
handky
and
feels
important
we
drift
and
the
engines
begin
to
beat
we
are
moving
in
the
harbour
everybody
watches
the
commander
and
the
crew
shout
orders
and
so
very
slowly
and
without
any
fuss
at
all
like
a
man
wheeling
a
barrow
out
of
a
yard
gate
we
throb
very
slowly
out
of
the
harbour
past
one
point
then
past
another
away
from
the
encircling
hills
away
from
the
great
lump
of
tavolara
which
is
to
southward
away
from
the
outreaching
land
to
the
north
and
over
the
edge
of
the
open
sea
and
now
to
try
for
a
cabin
to
ourselves
i
approach
the
steward
yes
he
says
he
has
it
in
mind
but
there
are
eighty
passengers
in
an
accommodation
space
for
forty
the
is
now
considering
it
most
probably
he
will
transfer
some
women
to
the
vacant
cabins
if
he
does
not
do
so
then
the
steward
will
accommodate
us
i
know
what
this
means
this
equivocation
we
decide
not
to
bother
any
more
so
we
make
a
tour
of
the
ship
to
look
at
the
soldiers
who
have
finished
eating
sitting
yarning
to
one
another
while
some
are
already
stretched
out
in
the
shadow
for
sleep
then
to
look
at
the
cattle
which
stand
rooted
to
the
deck
which
is
now
all
messy
to
look
at
the
unhappy
fowls
in
their
coops
and
a
peep
at
the
rather
horrifying
and
so
to
bed
already
the
other
three
berths
in
my
cabin
are
occupied
the
lights
are
switched
off
as
i
enter
i
hear
one
young
man
tenderly
enquiring
of
the
berth
below
dost
thou
feel
ill
er
not
much
not
much
says
the
other
faintly
yet
the
sea
is
like
glass
so
smooth
i
am
quickly
rolled
in
my
lower
berth
where
i
feel
the
trembling
of
the
ship
and
hear
the
creaking
of
the
berth
above
me
as
its
occupant
rolls
over
i
listen
to
the
sighs
of
the
others
the
wash
of
dark
water
and
so
uneasily
rather
hot
and
very
airless
uneasy
with
the
and
the
sighing
of
my
companions
and
with
a
cock
that
crows
shrilly
from
one
of
the
coops
imagining
the
lights
to
be
dawn
the
night
goes
by
one
sleeps
but
a
bad
sleep
if
only
there
were
cold
air
not
this
inside
cabin
airlessness
viii
back
the
sea
being
steady
as
a
level
road
nobody
succeeded
in
being
violently
sick
my
young
men
rose
at
dawn
i
was
not
long
in
following
it
was
a
gray
morning
on
deck
a
gray
sea
a
gray
sky
and
a
gray
unimportant
coast
of
italy
not
far
away
the
joined
me
and
quite
delighted
with
her
such
a
nice
girl
she
said
who
when
she
let
down
her
brown
hair
it
reached
rippling
right
to
her
feet
voilà
you
never
know
your
luck
the
cock
that
had
crowed
all
night
crowed
again
hoarsely
with
a
sore
throat
the
miserable
cattle
looked
more
wearily
miserable
but
still
were
motionless
as
sponges
that
grow
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
the
convicts
were
out
for
air
grinning
someone
told
us
they
were
considering
the
light
in
which
these
people
look
on
war
desertion
seemed
to
me
the
only
heroism
but
the
brought
up
in
a
military
air
gazed
upon
them
as
upon
men
miraculously
alive
within
the
shadow
of
death
according
to
her
code
they
had
been
shot
when
the
soldiers
had
unslung
the
tarpaulin
their
home
for
the
night
had
melted
with
the
darkness
they
were
mere
fragments
of
gray
transit
smoking
cigarettes
and
staring
overboard
we
drew
near
to
cività
vecchia
the
old
mediaeval
looking
port
with
its
castle
and
a
round
at
the
entrance
soldiers
aboard
shouted
and
waved
to
soldiers
on
the
ramparts
we
backed
insignificantly
into
the
rather
scrubby
insignificant
harbour
and
in
five
minutes
we
were
out
and
walking
along
the
wide
desolate
boulevard
to
the
station
the
looked
hard
at
us
but
no
doubt
owing
to
the
knapsack
took
us
for
poor
germans
coffee
and
milk
and
then
only
about
of
an
hour
late
the
train
from
the
north
it
is
the
night
express
from
turin
there
was
plenty
of
room
so
in
we
got
followed
by
half
a
dozen
sardinians
we
found
a
large
heavy
torinese
in
the
carriage
his
eyes
dead
with
fatigue
it
seemed
quite
a
new
world
on
the
mainland
and
at
once
one
breathed
again
the
curious
suspense
that
is
in
the
air
once
more
i
read
the
corriere
della
sera
from
end
to
end
once
more
we
knew
ourselves
in
the
real
active
world
where
the
air
seems
like
a
lively
wine
dissolving
the
pearl
of
the
old
order
i
hope
dear
reader
you
like
the
metaphor
yet
i
can
not
forbear
repeating
how
strongly
one
is
sensible
of
the
solvent
property
of
the
atmosphere
suddenly
arriving
on
the
mainland
again
and
in
an
hour
one
changes
one
psyche
the
human
being
is
a
most
curious
creature
he
thinks
he
has
got
one
soul
and
he
has
got
dozens
i
felt
my
sound
sardinian
soul
melting
off
me
i
felt
myself
evaporating
into
the
real
italian
uncertainty
and
momentaneity
so
i
perused
the
corriere
whilst
the
metamorphosis
took
place
i
like
italian
newspapers
because
they
say
what
they
mean
and
not
merely
what
is
most
convenient
to
say
we
call
it
naïveté
i
call
it
manliness
italian
newspapers
read
as
if
they
were
written
by
men
and
not
by
calculating
eunuchs
the
train
ran
very
heavily
along
the
maremma
it
began
to
rain
then
we
stopped
at
a
station
where
we
should
not
stop
somewhere
in
the
maremma
country
the
invisible
sea
not
far
off
the
low
country
cultivated
and
yet
forlorn
oh
how
the
turin
man
sighed
and
wearily
shifted
his
feet
as
the
train
stood
meaningless
there
it
sat
in
the
rain
oh
express
at
last
on
again
till
we
were
winding
through
the
curious
long
troughs
of
the
roman
campagna
there
the
shepherds
minded
the
sheep
the
merino
sheep
in
sardinia
the
merinos
were
very
white
and
glistening
so
that
one
thought
of
the
scriptural
white
as
wool
and
the
black
sheep
among
the
flock
were
very
black
but
these
campagna
were
no
longer
white
but
dingy
and
though
the
wildness
of
the
campagna
is
a
real
wildness
still
it
is
a
historic
wildness
familiar
in
its
way
as
a
fireside
is
familiar
so
we
approach
the
hopeless
sprawling
of
modern
rome
over
the
yellow
tiber
past
the
famous
pyramid
tomb
skirting
the
walls
of
the
city
till
at
last
we
plunge
in
into
the
station
out
of
all
the
chaos
we
are
late
it
is
a
quarter
to
twelve
and
i
have
to
go
out
and
change
money
and
i
hope
to
find
my
two
the
and
i
dash
down
the
platform
no
friends
at
the
barrier
the
station
moderately
empty
we
bolt
across
to
the
departure
platforms
the
naples
train
stands
ready
in
we
pitch
our
bags
ask
a
naval
man
not
to
let
anyone
steal
them
then
i
fly
out
into
town
while
the
buys
food
and
wine
at
the
buffet
it
no
longer
rains
and
rome
feels
as
ever
rather
and
not
inclined
to
care
about
anything
i
get
a
hundred
and
three
lira
for
each
pound
note
pocket
my
money
at
two
minutes
past
twelve
and
bolt
back
out
of
the
piazza
delle
terme
aha
there
are
the
two
missing
ones
just
descending
vaguely
from
a
carriage
the
one
gazing
inquiringly
through
his
monocle
across
the
the
other
very
tall
and
alert
and
elegant
looking
as
if
he
expected
us
to
appear
out
of
the
air
for
his
convenience
which
is
exactly
what
happens
we
fly
into
each
other
arms
oh
there
you
where
the
why
are
you
here
we
been
to
the
arrival
platform
no
of
you
of
course
i
only
got
your
wire
half
an
hour
ago
we
here
well
how
nice
to
see
oh
let
the
man
what
going
on
at
once
to
naples
but
must
you
oh
but
how
flighty
you
are
birds
of
passage
then
let
us
find
the
quick
and
they
wo
let
us
on
the
platform
no
they
not
issuing
platform
tickets
oh
merely
the
guests
returning
from
that
wedding
in
the
north
a
few
royal
duchesses
about
oh
well
we
must
try
and
wangle
him
at
the
barrier
a
woman
trying
in
vain
to
be
let
on
to
the
station
but
what
a
roman
matron
ca
do
an
elegant
young
englishman
can
so
our
two
heroes
wangle
their
way
in
and
fall
into
the
arms
of
the
by
the
naples
train
well
now
tell
us
all
about
it
so
we
rush
into
a
candlestick
of
conversation
in
my
ear
murmurs
he
of
the
monocle
about
the
sahara
he
is
back
from
the
sahara
a
week
ago
the
winter
sun
in
the
sahara
he
with
the
smears
of
paint
on
his
elegant
trousers
is
giving
the
a
sketchy
outline
of
his
now
click
goes
the
exchange
and
him
of
the
monocle
is
detailing
to
the
his
trip
to
japan
on
which
he
will
start
in
six
weeks
time
while
him
of
the
is
expatiating
on
the
thrills
of
the
etching
needle
and
concocting
a
plan
for
a
month
in
sardinia
in
may
with
me
doing
the
scribbles
and
he
the
pictures
what
sort
of
pictures
out
flies
the
name
of
and
well
now
a
general
rush
into
oneness
and
wo
they
come
down
to
sicily
to
us
for
the
almond
blossom
in
about
ten
days
time
yes
they
will
wire
when
the
almond
blossom
is
just
stepping
on
the
stage
and
making
its
grand
bow
and
they
will
come
next
day
somebody
has
smitten
the
wheel
of
a
coach
two
ringing
smacks
with
a
hammer
this
is
a
sign
to
get
in
the
is
terrified
the
train
will
slip
through
her
fingers
i
frightened
i
must
get
in
very
well
then
you
sure
you
have
everything
you
want
everything
a
fiasco
of
vino
oh
all
the
better
well
then
ten
days
time
all
right
quite
sure
how
nice
to
have
seen
you
if
only
a
yes
yes
poor
yes
you
quite
safe
the
door
is
shut
we
are
seated
the
train
moves
out
of
the
station
and
quickly
on
this
route
rome
disappears
we
are
out
on
the
wintry
campagna
where
crops
are
going
away
on
the
left
we
see
the
tivoli
hills
and
think
of
the
summer
that
is
gone
the
heat
the
fountains
of
the
villa
the
train
rolls
heavily
over
the
campagna
towards
the
alban
mounts
homewards
so
we
fall
on
our
food
and
devour
the
excellent
little
and
rolls
and
boiled
eggs
apples
and
oranges
and
dates
and
drink
the
good
red
wine
and
wildly
discuss
plans
and
the
latest
news
and
are
altogether
thrilled
about
things
so
thrilled
that
we
are
well
away
among
the
romantic
mountains
of
the
before
we
realise
that
there
are
other
passengers
besides
ourselves
in
the
carriage
half
the
journey
is
over
why
there
is
the
monastery
on
its
high
hill
in
a
wild
moment
i
suggest
we
shall
get
down
and
spend
a
night
up
there
at
montecassino
and
see
the
other
friend
the
monk
who
knows
so
much
about
the
world
being
out
of
it
but
the
shudders
thinking
of
the
awful
winter
coldness
of
that
massive
stone
monastery
which
has
no
spark
of
heating
apparatus
and
therefore
the
plan
subsides
and
at
cassino
station
i
only
get
down
to
procure
coffee
and
sweet
cakes
they
always
have
good
things
to
eat
at
cassino
station
in
summer
big
fresh
ices
and
fruits
and
iced
water
in
winter
toothsome
sweet
cakes
which
make
an
awfully
good
finish
to
a
meal
i
count
cassino
half
way
to
naples
after
cassino
the
excitement
of
being
in
the
north
begins
quite
to
evaporate
the
southern
heaviness
descends
upon
us
also
the
sky
begins
to
darken
and
the
rain
falls
i
think
of
the
night
before
us
on
the
sea
again
and
i
am
vaguely
troubled
lest
we
may
not
get
a
berth
however
we
may
spend
the
night
in
naples
or
even
sit
on
in
this
train
which
goes
forward
all
through
the
long
long
night
to
the
straits
of
messina
we
must
decide
as
we
near
naples
half
dozing
one
becomes
aware
of
the
people
about
one
we
are
travelling
second
class
opposite
is
a
little
young
person
in
next
her
a
white
soldier
with
ribbons
on
his
breast
then
a
fat
man
in
a
corner
then
a
naval
officer
of
low
rank
the
naval
officer
is
coming
from
fiume
and
is
dead
with
sleep
and
perhaps
mortification
has
just
given
up
two
compartments
away
we
hear
soldiers
singing
martial
still
though
bruised
with
fatigue
the
songs
of
fiume
they
are
soldiers
of
the
legion
and
one
of
them
i
hear
the
sick
soldier
saying
is
very
hot
and
republican
still
private
soldiers
are
not
allowed
with
their
reduced
tickets
to
travel
on
the
express
trains
but
these
legionaries
are
not
penniless
they
have
paid
the
excess
and
come
along
for
the
moment
they
are
sent
to
their
homes
and
with
heads
dropping
with
fatigue
we
hear
them
still
defiantly
singing
down
the
carriage
for
a
regular
officer
went
along
a
captain
of
the
italian
not
the
fiume
army
he
heard
the
chants
and
entered
the
carriage
the
legionaries
were
quiet
but
they
lounged
and
ignored
the
entry
of
the
officer
on
your
feet
he
yelled
italian
fashion
the
vehemence
did
it
reluctantly
as
may
be
they
stood
up
in
the
compartment
salute
and
though
it
was
bitter
up
went
their
hands
in
the
salute
whilst
he
stood
and
watched
them
and
then
very
superb
he
sauntered
away
again
they
sat
down
glowering
of
course
they
were
beaten
did
they
know
it
the
men
in
our
carriage
smiled
curiously
in
slow
and
futile
mockery
of
both
parties
the
rain
was
falling
outside
the
windows
were
steamed
quite
dense
so
that
we
were
shut
in
from
the
world
throughout
the
length
of
the
train
which
was
not
very
full
could
be
felt
the
exhausted
weariness
and
the
dispirited
dejection
of
the
poor
legionaries
in
the
afternoon
silence
of
the
train
the
snatches
of
song
broke
out
again
and
faded
in
sheer
dispirited
fatigue
we
ran
on
blindly
and
heavily
but
one
young
fellow
was
not
to
be
abashed
he
was
and
his
thick
black
hair
was
brushed
up
like
a
great
fluffy
crest
upon
his
head
he
came
slowly
and
unabated
down
the
corridor
and
on
every
big
pane
he
scrawled
with
his
finger
w
gabriele
w
gabriele
the
sick
soldier
laughed
thinly
saying
to
the
schoolmistress
oh
yes
they
are
fine
chaps
but
it
was
folly
is
a
world
poet
a
world
wonder
but
fiume
was
a
mistake
you
know
and
these
chaps
have
got
to
learn
a
lesson
they
got
beyond
themselves
oh
they
are
short
of
money
had
of
money
there
in
fiume
and
he
altogether
mean
with
it
the
schoolmistress
who
was
one
of
the
sharp
ones
gave
a
little
disquisition
to
show
it
was
a
mistake
and
wherein
she
knew
better
than
the
world
poet
and
wonder
it
always
makes
me
sick
to
hear
people
chewing
over
newspaper
pulp
the
sick
soldier
was
not
a
legionary
he
had
been
wounded
through
the
lung
but
it
was
healed
he
said
he
lifted
the
flap
of
his
breast
pocket
and
there
hung
a
little
silver
medal
it
was
his
he
wore
it
concealed
and
over
the
place
of
the
wound
he
and
the
schoolmistress
looked
at
one
another
significantly
then
they
talked
pensions
and
soon
were
on
the
old
topic
the
schoolmistress
had
her
figures
pat
as
a
schoolmistress
should
why
the
the
man
who
punches
one
tickets
on
the
train
now
had
twelve
thousand
lira
a
year
twelve
thousand
lira
monstrous
whilst
a
a
schoolmaster
who
had
been
through
all
his
training
and
had
all
his
degrees
was
given
five
thousand
five
thousand
for
a
fully
qualified
and
twelve
thousand
for
a
ticket
puncher
the
soldier
agreed
and
quoted
other
figures
but
the
railway
was
the
outstanding
grievance
every
boy
who
left
school
now
said
the
schoolmistress
wanted
to
go
on
the
railway
oh
but
said
the
soldier
the
the
naval
officer
who
collapsed
into
the
most
uncanny
positions
blind
with
sleep
got
down
at
capua
to
get
into
a
little
train
that
would
carry
him
back
to
his
own
station
where
our
train
had
not
stopped
at
caserta
the
sick
soldier
got
out
down
the
great
avenue
of
trees
the
rain
was
falling
a
young
man
entered
remained
also
the
schoolmistress
and
the
stout
man
knowing
we
had
been
listening
the
schoolmistress
spoke
to
us
about
the
soldier
then
she
had
said
she
was
catching
the
night
boat
for
palermo
i
asked
her
if
she
thought
the
ship
would
be
very
full
oh
yes
very
full
she
said
why
hers
was
one
of
the
last
cabin
numbers
and
she
had
got
her
ticket
early
that
morning
the
fat
man
now
joined
in
he
too
was
crossing
to
palermo
the
ship
was
sure
to
be
quite
full
by
now
were
we
depending
on
booking
berths
at
the
port
of
naples
we
were
whereupon
he
and
the
schoolmistress
shook
their
heads
and
said
it
was
more
than
doubtful
nay
it
was
as
good
as
impossible
for
the
boat
was
the
renowned
di
that
floating
palace
and
such
was
the
fame
of
her
gorgeousness
that
everybody
wanted
to
travel
by
her
first
and
second
class
alike
i
asked
oh
yes
also
first
class
replied
the
rather
spitefully
so
i
knew
she
had
a
white
ticket
second
i
cursed
the
di
and
her
gorgeousness
and
looked
down
my
nose
we
had
now
two
alternatives
to
spend
the
night
in
naples
or
to
sit
on
all
through
the
night
and
next
morning
and
arrive
home
with
heaven
aid
in
the
early
afternoon
though
these
trains
think
nothing
of
six
hours
late
but
we
were
tired
already
what
we
should
be
like
after
another
hours
sitting
heaven
knows
and
yet
to
struggle
for
a
bed
in
a
naples
hotel
this
night
in
the
rain
all
the
hotels
being
at
present
crammed
with
foreigners
that
was
no
rosy
prospect
oh
dear
however
i
was
not
going
to
take
their
discouragement
so
easily
one
has
been
had
that
way
before
they
love
to
make
the
case
look
desperate
were
we
english
asked
the
schoolmistress
we
were
ah
a
fine
thing
to
be
english
in
italy
now
rather
tart
from
me
because
of
the
the
exchange
you
english
with
your
money
exchange
you
come
here
and
buy
everything
for
nothing
you
take
the
best
of
everything
and
with
your
money
you
pay
nothing
for
it
whereas
we
poor
italians
we
pay
heavily
for
everything
at
an
exaggerated
price
and
we
can
have
nothing
ah
it
is
all
very
nice
to
be
english
in
italy
now
you
can
travel
you
go
to
the
hotels
you
can
see
everything
and
buy
everything
and
it
costs
you
nothing
what
is
the
exchange
today
she
whipped
it
out
a
hundred
and
four
twenty
this
she
told
me
to
my
nose
and
the
fat
man
murmured
bitterly
già
ay
ay
her
impertinence
and
the
fat
man
quiet
bitterness
stirred
my
bile
has
not
this
song
been
sung
at
me
once
too
often
by
these
people
you
are
mistaken
said
i
to
the
schoolmistress
we
do
by
any
means
live
in
italy
for
nothing
even
with
the
exchange
at
a
hundred
and
three
we
do
live
for
nothing
we
pay
and
pay
through
the
nose
for
whatever
we
have
in
italy
and
you
italians
see
that
we
pay
what
you
put
all
the
tariff
you
do
on
foreigners
and
then
say
we
live
here
for
nothing
i
tell
you
i
could
live
in
england
just
as
well
on
the
same
money
perhaps
better
compare
the
cost
of
things
in
england
with
the
cost
here
in
italy
and
even
considering
the
exchange
italy
costs
nearly
as
much
as
england
some
things
are
cheaper
here
the
railway
comes
a
little
cheaper
and
is
infinitely
more
miserable
travelling
is
usually
a
misery
but
other
things
clothes
of
all
sorts
and
a
good
deal
of
food
is
even
more
expensive
here
than
in
england
exchange
considered
oh
yes
she
said
england
had
had
to
bring
her
prices
down
this
last
fortnight
in
her
own
interests
indeed
this
last
fortnight
this
last
six
months
said
i
whereas
prices
rise
every
single
day
here
here
a
word
from
the
quiet
young
man
who
had
got
in
at
caserta
yes
he
said
yes
i
say
every
nation
pays
in
its
own
money
no
matter
what
the
exchange
and
it
works
out
about
equal
but
i
felt
angry
am
i
always
to
have
the
exchange
flung
in
my
teeth
as
if
i
were
a
personal
thief
but
the
woman
persisted
ah
she
said
we
italians
we
are
so
nice
we
are
so
good
noi
siamo
così
buoni
we
are
so
but
others
they
are
not
buoni
they
are
not
to
us
and
she
nodded
her
head
and
truly
i
did
not
feel
at
all
towards
her
which
she
knew
and
as
for
the
italian
it
forms
a
sound
and
unshakeable
basis
nowadays
for
their
extortion
and
and
spite
darkness
was
falling
over
the
rich
flat
plains
that
lie
around
naples
over
the
tall
uncanny
vines
with
their
brown
thongs
in
the
intensely
cultivated
black
earth
it
was
night
by
the
time
we
were
in
that
vast
and
thievish
station
about
five
we
were
not
very
late
should
we
sit
on
in
our
present
carriage
and
go
down
in
it
to
the
port
along
with
the
schoolmistress
and
risk
it
but
first
look
at
the
coach
which
was
going
on
to
sicily
so
we
got
down
and
ran
along
the
train
to
the
syracuse
coach
hubbub
confusion
a
wedge
in
the
corridor
and
for
sure
no
room
certainly
no
room
to
lie
down
a
bit
we
not
sit
tight
for
hours
more
so
we
decided
to
go
to
the
port
and
to
walk
heaven
knows
when
the
railway
carriage
would
be
shunted
down
back
we
went
therefore
for
the
sack
told
the
schoolmistress
our
intention
you
can
but
try
she
said
frostily
so
there
we
are
with
the
sack
over
my
shoulder
and
the
kitchenino
in
the
hand
bursting
out
of
that
and
annoying
station
and
running
through
the
black
wet
gulf
of
a
naples
night
in
a
slow
rain
cabmen
look
at
us
but
my
sack
saved
me
i
am
weary
of
that
a
naples
cabman
after
dark
by
day
there
is
a
tariff
it
is
about
a
mile
from
the
station
to
the
quay
where
the
ship
lies
we
make
our
way
through
the
deep
streets
over
the
slippery
black
cobbles
the
black
houses
rise
massive
to
a
great
height
on
either
side
but
the
streets
are
not
in
this
part
very
narrow
we
plunge
forwards
in
the
unearthly
of
this
great
uncontrolled
city
there
are
no
lights
at
all
from
the
buildings
only
the
small
electric
lamps
of
the
streets
so
we
emerge
on
the
harbour
front
and
hurry
past
the
great
storehouses
in
the
rainy
night
to
where
the
actual
entrances
begin
the
tram
bangs
past
us
we
scuffle
along
that
which
lies
like
an
isthmus
down
the
vast
black
quicksands
of
that
harbour
road
one
feels
peril
all
round
but
at
length
we
come
to
a
gate
by
the
harbour
railway
no
not
that
on
to
the
next
iron
gate
of
the
railway
crossing
and
so
we
run
out
past
the
great
sheds
and
the
buildings
of
the
port
station
till
we
see
a
ship
rearing
in
front
and
the
sea
all
black
but
now
where
is
that
little
hole
where
one
gets
the
tickets
we
are
at
the
back
of
everywhere
in
this
desert
jungle
of
the
harbour
darkness
a
man
directs
us
round
the
corner
and
actually
does
not
demand
money
it
is
the
sack
again
so
there
i
see
the
knot
of
men
soldiers
chiefly
fighting
in
a
bare
room
round
a
tiny
wicket
i
recognise
the
place
where
i
have
fought
before
so
while
the
stands
guard
over
sack
and
bag
i
plunge
into
the
fray
it
literally
is
a
fight
some
thirty
men
all
at
once
want
to
get
at
a
tiny
wicket
in
a
blank
wall
there
are
no
there
is
no
order
just
a
hole
in
a
blank
wall
and
thirty
fellows
mostly
military
pressing
at
it
in
a
mass
but
i
have
done
this
before
the
way
is
to
insert
the
thin
end
of
oneself
and
without
any
violence
by
deadly
pressure
and
pertinacity
come
at
the
goal
one
hand
must
be
kept
fast
over
the
money
pocket
and
one
must
be
free
to
clutch
the
when
one
gets
there
and
thus
one
is
ground
small
in
those
mills
of
god
demos
struggling
for
tickets
it
is
very
nice
so
close
so
incomparably
crushed
and
never
for
a
second
must
one
be
off
one
guard
for
one
watch
and
money
and
even
hanky
when
i
first
came
to
italy
after
the
war
i
was
robbed
twice
in
three
weeks
floating
round
in
the
sweet
old
innocent
confidence
in
mankind
since
then
i
have
never
ceased
to
be
on
my
guard
somehow
or
other
waking
and
sleeping
one
spirit
must
be
on
its
guard
nowadays
which
is
really
what
i
prefer
now
i
have
learnt
it
confidence
in
the
goodness
of
mankind
is
a
very
thin
protection
indeed
vitae
scelerisque
will
do
nothing
for
you
when
it
comes
to
humanity
however
efficacious
it
may
be
with
lions
and
wolves
therefore
tight
on
my
guard
like
a
screw
biting
into
a
bit
of
wood
i
bite
my
way
through
that
knot
of
fellows
to
the
wicket
and
shout
for
two
the
clerk
inside
ignores
me
for
some
time
serving
soldiers
but
if
you
stand
like
doomsday
you
get
your
way
two
firsts
says
the
clerk
husband
and
wife
say
i
in
case
there
is
a
cabin
jokes
behind
but
i
get
my
tickets
impossible
to
put
my
hand
to
my
pocket
the
tickets
cost
about
a
hundred
and
five
francs
each
clutching
paper
change
and
the
green
slips
with
a
last
gasp
i
get
out
of
the
knot
so
we
done
it
as
i
sort
my
money
and
stow
away
i
hear
another
ask
for
one
nothing
left
says
the
clerk
so
you
see
how
one
must
fight
i
must
say
for
these
dense
and
struggling
crowds
they
are
only
intense
not
violent
and
not
in
the
least
brutal
i
always
feel
a
certain
sympathy
with
the
men
in
them
bolt
through
the
pouring
rain
to
the
ship
and
in
two
minutes
we
are
aboard
and
behold
each
of
us
has
a
deck
cabin
i
one
to
myself
the
to
herself
next
door
palatial
not
a
cabin
at
all
but
a
proper
little
bedroom
with
a
curtained
bed
under
the
porthole
windows
a
comfortable
sofa
chairs
table
carpets
big
with
silver
taps
a
whole
i
dropped
the
sack
on
the
sofa
with
a
gasp
drew
back
the
yellow
curtains
of
the
bed
looked
out
of
the
porthole
at
the
lights
of
naples
and
sighed
with
relief
one
could
wash
thoroughly
refreshingly
and
change
one
linen
wonderful
the
is
like
a
hotel
lounge
many
little
tables
with
flowers
and
periodicals
warm
carpet
bright
but
soft
lights
and
people
sitting
about
chatting
a
loud
group
of
english
people
in
one
corner
very
assured
two
quiet
english
ladies
various
italians
seeming
quite
modest
here
one
could
sit
in
peace
and
rest
pretending
to
look
at
an
illustrated
magazine
so
we
rested
after
about
an
hour
there
entered
a
young
englishman
and
his
wife
whom
we
had
seen
on
our
train
so
at
last
the
coach
had
been
shunted
down
to
the
port
where
should
we
have
been
had
we
waited
the
waiters
began
to
flap
the
white
and
spread
the
tables
nearest
the
walls
dinner
would
begin
at
seven
immediately
the
boat
started
we
sat
in
silence
till
eight
or
nine
tables
were
spread
then
we
let
the
other
people
take
their
choice
after
which
we
chose
a
table
by
ourselves
neither
of
us
wanting
company
so
we
sat
before
the
plates
and
the
and
sighed
in
the
hopes
of
a
decent
meal
food
by
the
way
is
not
included
in
the
francs
alas
we
were
not
to
be
alone
two
young
neapolitans
pleasant
quiet
blond
or
they
were
and
evidently
of
northern
extraction
afterwards
we
found
out
they
were
jewellers
but
i
liked
their
quiet
gentle
manners
the
dinner
began
and
we
were
through
the
soup
when
up
pranced
another
young
fellow
rather
strapping
and
loud
a
commercial
traveller
for
sure
he
had
those
cocky
assured
manners
of
one
who
is
not
sure
of
his
manners
he
had
a
rather
high
forehead
and
black
hair
brushed
up
in
a
showy
wing
and
a
large
ring
on
his
finger
not
that
a
ring
signifies
anything
here
most
of
the
men
wear
several
all
massively
jewelled
if
one
believed
in
all
the
jewels
why
italy
would
be
more
fabulous
than
fabled
india
but
our
friend
the
bounder
was
smart
and
smelled
of
cash
not
money
but
cash
i
had
an
inkling
of
what
to
expect
when
he
handed
the
salt
and
said
in
english
salt
thenk
you
but
i
ignored
the
advance
however
he
did
not
wait
long
through
the
windows
across
the
room
the
saw
the
lights
of
the
harbour
slowly
moving
oh
she
cried
are
we
going
and
also
in
italian
partiamo
all
watched
the
lights
the
bounder
screwing
round
he
had
one
of
the
fine
bounderish
backs
yes
he
said
we
oh
cried
she
do
you
speak
english
some
english
i
speak
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
spoke
about
forty
disconnected
words
but
his
accent
was
so
good
for
these
forty
he
did
not
speak
english
he
imitated
an
english
voice
making
sounds
and
the
effect
was
startling
he
had
served
on
the
italian
front
with
the
scots
guards
so
he
told
us
in
italian
he
was
milanese
oh
he
had
had
a
time
with
the
scots
guards
wheesky
eh
wheesky
come
along
he
shouted
and
it
was
such
a
scotch
voice
shouting
so
and
actual
i
nearly
went
under
the
table
it
struck
us
both
like
a
blow
afterwards
he
rattled
away
without
misgiving
he
was
a
traveller
for
a
certain
type
of
machine
and
was
doing
sicily
shortly
he
was
going
to
england
and
he
asked
largely
about
hotels
then
he
asked
was
the
french
was
she
italian
no
she
was
german
ah
german
and
immediately
out
he
came
with
the
german
word
deutsch
deutsch
eh
from
deutschland
oh
yes
deutschland
über
alles
ah
i
know
no
more
what
deutschland
unter
alles
now
deutschland
unter
alles
and
he
bounced
on
his
seat
with
gratification
of
the
words
of
german
as
of
english
he
knew
half
a
dozen
phrases
no
said
the
not
deutschland
unter
alles
not
for
long
anyhow
how
not
for
long
you
think
so
i
think
so
too
said
the
bounder
then
in
italian
la
germania
wo
stand
under
all
for
long
no
no
at
present
it
is
england
über
alles
über
but
germany
will
rise
up
again
of
course
said
the
how
should
she
ah
said
the
bounder
while
england
keeps
the
money
in
her
pocket
we
shall
none
of
us
rise
up
italy
won
the
war
and
germany
lost
it
and
italy
and
germany
they
both
are
down
and
england
is
up
they
both
are
down
and
england
is
up
england
and
france
strange
is
it
ah
the
allies
what
are
the
allies
for
to
keep
england
up
and
france
half
way
and
germany
and
italy
down
ah
they
wo
stay
down
for
ever
said
the
you
think
not
ah
we
will
see
we
will
see
how
england
goes
on
now
england
is
not
going
on
so
marvellously
after
all
say
i
how
not
you
mean
ireland
no
not
only
ireland
industry
altogether
england
is
as
near
to
ruin
as
other
countries
ma
with
all
the
money
and
we
others
with
no
money
how
will
she
be
ruined
and
what
good
would
it
be
to
you
if
she
were
oh
well
who
knows
if
england
were
ruined
a
slow
smile
of
anticipation
spread
over
his
face
how
he
would
love
it
how
they
would
all
love
it
if
england
were
ruined
that
is
the
business
part
of
them
perhaps
would
not
love
it
but
the
human
part
would
the
human
part
fairly
licks
its
lips
at
the
thought
of
england
ruin
the
commercial
part
however
quite
violently
disclaims
the
anticipations
of
the
human
part
and
there
it
is
the
newspapers
chiefly
speak
with
the
commercial
voice
but
individually
when
you
are
got
at
in
a
railway
carriage
or
as
now
on
a
ship
up
speaks
the
human
voice
and
you
know
how
they
love
you
this
is
no
doubt
inevitable
when
the
exchange
stands
at
a
hundred
and
six
men
go
humanly
blind
i
suppose
however
much
they
may
keep
the
commercial
eye
open
and
having
gone
humanly
blind
they
bump
into
human
self
nastily
a
nasty
jar
you
know
then
how
they
hate
you
underneath
they
hate
us
and
as
human
beings
we
are
objects
of
envy
and
malice
they
hate
us
with
envy
and
despise
us
with
jealousy
which
perhaps
does
hurt
commercially
humanly
it
is
to
me
unpleasant
the
dinner
was
over
and
the
bounder
was
lavishing
cigarettes
murattis
if
you
please
we
had
all
drunk
two
bottles
of
wine
two
other
commercial
travellers
had
joined
the
bounder
at
our
table
two
smart
young
fellows
one
a
bounder
and
one
gentle
and
nice
our
two
jewellers
remained
quiet
talking
their
share
but
quietly
and
so
sensitively
one
could
not
help
liking
them
so
we
were
seven
people
six
men
wheesky
will
you
drink
wheesky
mister
said
our
original
bounder
yes
one
small
scotch
one
scotch
wheesky
all
this
in
a
perfect
scotty
voice
of
a
man
standing
at
a
bar
calling
for
a
drink
it
was
comical
one
could
not
but
laugh
and
very
impertinent
he
called
for
the
waiter
took
him
by
the
and
with
a
intimacy
asked
if
there
was
whisky
the
waiter
with
the
same
tone
of
said
he
did
think
there
was
whisky
but
he
would
look
our
bounder
went
round
the
table
inviting
us
all
to
whiskies
and
pressing
on
us
his
expensive
english
cigarettes
with
great
aplomb
the
whisky
came
and
five
persons
partook
it
was
fiery
oily
stuff
from
heaven
knows
where
the
bounder
rattled
away
spouting
his
bits
of
english
and
his
four
words
of
german
he
was
in
high
feather
wriggling
his
large
haunches
on
his
chair
and
waving
his
hands
he
had
a
peculiar
manner
of
wriggling
from
the
bottom
of
his
back
with
fussy
it
was
my
turn
to
offer
whisky
i
was
able
in
a
moment
lull
to
peer
through
the
windows
and
see
the
dim
lights
of
capri
the
glimmer
of
anacapri
up
on
the
black
shadow
the
lighthouse
we
had
passed
the
island
in
the
midst
of
the
babel
i
sent
out
a
few
thoughts
to
a
few
people
on
the
island
then
i
had
to
come
back
the
bounder
had
once
more
resumed
his
theme
of
la
germania
he
swanked
england
as
hard
as
he
could
of
course
england
was
the
top
dog
and
if
he
could
speak
some
english
if
he
were
talking
to
english
people
and
if
as
he
said
he
was
going
to
england
in
april
why
he
was
so
much
the
more
than
his
companions
who
could
not
rise
to
all
these
heights
at
the
same
time
my
nerves
had
too
much
to
bear
where
were
we
going
and
where
had
we
been
and
where
did
we
live
and
ah
yes
english
people
lived
in
italy
thousands
thousands
of
english
people
lived
in
italy
yes
it
was
very
nice
for
them
there
used
to
be
many
germans
but
now
the
germans
were
down
but
the
english
what
could
be
better
for
them
than
italy
now
they
had
sun
they
had
warmth
they
had
abundance
of
everything
they
had
a
charming
people
to
deal
with
and
they
had
the
ecco
the
other
commercial
travellers
agreed
they
appealed
to
the
if
it
was
not
so
and
altogether
i
had
enough
of
it
oh
yes
said
i
it
very
nice
to
be
in
italy
especially
if
you
are
not
living
in
an
hotel
and
you
have
to
attend
to
things
for
yourself
it
is
very
nice
to
be
overcharged
every
time
and
then
insulted
if
you
say
a
word
it
very
nice
to
have
the
thrown
in
your
teeth
if
you
say
two
words
to
any
italian
even
a
perfect
stranger
it
very
nice
to
have
waiters
and
and
railway
porters
sneering
in
a
bad
temper
and
being
insulting
in
small
mean
ways
all
the
time
very
nice
to
feel
what
they
all
feel
against
you
and
if
you
understand
enough
italian
it
very
nice
to
hear
what
they
say
when
you
gone
by
oh
very
nice
very
nice
indeed
i
suppose
the
whisky
had
kindled
this
outburst
in
me
they
sat
dead
silent
and
then
our
bounder
began
in
his
sugary
deprecating
voice
why
no
why
no
it
is
not
true
signore
no
it
is
not
true
why
england
is
the
foremost
nation
in
the
world
and
you
want
to
pay
her
out
for
it
but
no
signore
but
no
what
makes
you
say
so
why
we
italians
are
so
noi
italiani
siamo
così
buoni
siamo
così
buoni
it
was
the
identical
words
of
the
schoolmistress
buoni
said
i
yes
perhaps
buoni
when
it
not
a
question
of
the
exchange
and
of
money
but
since
it
is
always
a
question
of
and
now
one
is
always
in
a
small
way
insulted
i
suppose
it
must
have
been
the
whisky
anyhow
italians
can
never
bear
hard
bitterness
the
jewellers
looked
distressed
the
bounders
looked
down
their
noses
half
exulting
even
now
and
half
sheepish
being
caught
the
third
of
the
the
gentle
one
made
large
eyes
and
was
terrified
that
he
was
going
to
be
sick
he
represented
a
certain
italian
liqueur
and
he
modestly
asked
us
to
take
a
glass
of
it
he
went
with
the
waiter
to
secure
the
proper
brand
so
we
drank
and
it
was
good
but
he
the
giver
sat
with
large
and
haunted
eyes
then
he
said
he
would
go
to
bed
our
bounder
gave
him
various
advice
regarding
seasickness
there
was
a
mild
swell
on
the
sea
so
he
of
the
liqueur
departed
our
bounder
thrummed
on
the
table
and
hummed
something
and
asked
the
if
she
knew
the
he
always
appealed
to
her
she
said
she
did
and
ah
he
was
passionately
fond
of
music
said
he
then
he
warbled
in
a
head
voice
a
bit
more
he
only
knew
classical
music
said
he
and
he
mewed
a
bit
of
moussorgsky
the
said
moussorgsky
was
her
favourite
musician
for
opera
ah
cried
the
bounder
if
there
were
but
a
piano
there
is
a
piano
said
his
yes
he
replied
but
it
is
locked
then
let
us
get
the
key
said
his
mate
with
aplomb
the
waiters
being
men
with
the
same
feelings
as
our
two
would
give
them
anything
so
the
key
was
forthcoming
we
paid
our
bills
mine
about
sixty
francs
then
we
went
along
the
faintly
rolling
ship
up
the
curved
staircase
to
the
drawing
room
our
bounder
unlocked
the
door
of
this
drawing
room
and
switched
on
the
lights
it
was
quite
a
pleasant
room
with
deep
divans
upholstered
in
pale
colours
and
standing
behind
little
tables
and
a
black
upright
piano
our
bounder
sat
on
the
and
gave
us
an
exhibition
he
splashed
out
noise
on
the
piano
in
splashes
like
water
splashing
out
of
a
pail
he
lifted
his
head
and
shook
his
black
mop
of
hair
and
yelled
out
some
fragments
of
opera
and
he
wriggled
his
large
bounder
back
upon
the
piano
stool
wriggling
upon
his
haunches
evidently
he
had
a
great
deal
of
feeling
for
music
but
very
little
prowess
he
yelped
it
out
and
wriggled
and
splashed
the
piano
his
friend
the
other
bounder
a
quiet
one
in
a
pale
suit
with
stout
limbs
older
than
the
wriggler
stood
by
the
piano
whilst
the
young
one
exhibited
across
the
space
of
carpet
sat
the
two
brother
jewellers
deep
in
a
divan
their
lean
faces
quite
inscrutable
the
sat
next
to
me
asking
for
this
and
that
music
none
of
which
the
wriggler
could
supply
he
knew
four
scraps
and
a
few
splashes
not
more
the
elder
bounder
stood
near
him
quietly
comforting
encouraging
and
admiring
him
as
a
lover
encouraging
and
admiring
his
betrothed
and
the
sat
and
excited
admiring
that
a
man
could
perform
so
and
give
himself
away
with
such
generous
wriggles
for
my
part
as
you
may
guess
i
did
not
admire
i
had
had
enough
rising
i
bowed
and
marched
off
the
came
after
me
said
i
at
the
head
of
the
corridor
she
turned
in
and
i
went
round
the
ship
to
look
at
the
dark
night
of
the
sea
morning
came
sunny
with
pieces
of
cloud
and
the
sicilian
coast
towering
pale
blue
in
the
distance
how
wonderful
it
must
have
been
to
ulysses
to
venture
into
this
mediterranean
and
open
his
eyes
on
all
the
loveliness
of
the
tall
coasts
how
marvellous
to
steal
with
his
ship
into
these
magic
harbours
there
is
something
eternally
about
these
lands
as
they
rise
from
the
sea
and
it
is
always
the
odyssey
which
comes
back
to
one
as
one
looks
at
them
all
the
lovely
of
this
world
in
homer
day
our
bounder
was
dashing
about
on
deck
in
one
of
those
gathered
in
at
the
waist
and
ballooning
out
into
skirts
below
the
waist
he
greeted
me
with
a
cry
of
it
a
long
long
way
to
tipperary
very
long
said
i
piccadilly
he
continued
ciao
said
i
as
he
dashed
jauntily
down
the
steps
soon
we
saw
the
others
as
well
but
it
was
morning
and
i
simply
did
not
want
to
speak
to
them
except
just
for
my
life
i
could
say
two
more
words
to
any
of
them
this
morning
except
to
ask
the
mild
one
if
he
had
been
sick
he
had
not
so
we
waited
for
the
great
di
to
float
her
way
into
palermo
harbour
it
looked
so
near
the
town
there
the
great
circle
of
the
port
the
mass
of
the
hills
crowding
round
panormus
the
i
wished
the
bulky
steamer
would
hurry
up
for
i
hated
her
now
i
hated
her
swankiness
she
seemed
made
for
commercial
travellers
with
cash
i
hated
the
big
picture
that
filled
one
end
of
the
an
elegant
and
ideal
a
sort
of
italia
strolling
on
a
lovely
and
ideal
cliff
edge
among
myriad
blooms
and
carrying
over
her
arm
in
a
most
sophisticated
fashion
a
bough
of
almond
blossom
and
a
sheaf
of
anemones
i
hated
the
waiters
and
the
cheap
elegance
the
common
i
disliked
the
people
who
all
turned
their
worst
sides
outwards
on
this
ship
vulgar
vulgar
commercialism
and
i
longed
to
get
off
and
the
bloated
boat
edged
her
way
so
slowly
into
the
port
and
then
more
slowly
still
edged
round
her
fat
stern
and
even
then
we
were
kept
for
fifteen
minutes
waiting
for
someone
to
put
up
the
gangway
for
the
first
class
the
second
class
of
course
were
streaming
off
and
melting
like
thawed
snow
into
the
crowds
of
onlookers
on
the
quay
long
before
we
were
allowed
to
come
off
glad
glad
i
was
to
get
off
that
ship
i
do
know
why
for
she
was
clean
and
comfortable
and
the
attendants
were
perfectly
civil
glad
glad
i
was
not
to
share
the
deck
with
any
more
commercial
travellers
glad
i
was
to
be
on
my
own
feet
independent
no
i
would
take
a
carriage
i
carried
my
sack
on
my
back
to
the
hotel
looking
with
a
jaundiced
eye
on
the
lethargic
traffic
of
the
harbour
front
it
was
about
nine
later
on
when
i
had
slept
i
thought
as
i
have
thought
before
the
italians
are
not
to
blame
for
their
spite
against
us
we
england
have
taken
upon
ourselves
for
so
long
the
rôle
of
leading
nation
and
if
now
in
the
war
or
after
the
war
we
have
led
them
all
into
a
real
old
swinery
which
we
have
notwithstanding
all
entente
cant
then
they
have
a
legitimate
grudge
against
us
if
you
take
upon
yourself
to
lead
you
must
expect
the
mud
to
be
thrown
at
you
if
you
lead
into
a
nasty
morass
especially
if
once
in
the
bog
you
think
of
nothing
else
but
scrambling
out
over
other
poor
devils
backs
pretty
behaviour
of
great
nations
and
still
for
all
that
i
must
insist
that
i
am
a
single
human
being
an
individual
not
a
mere
national
unit
a
mere
chip
of
or
la
germania
i
am
not
a
chip
of
any
nasty
old
block
i
am
myself
in
the
evening
the
insisted
on
going
to
the
marionettes
for
which
she
has
a
sentimental
passion
so
the
three
of
us
we
were
with
the
american
friend
once
more
chased
through
dark
and
tortuous
and
markets
of
palermo
in
the
night
until
at
last
a
friendly
man
led
us
to
the
place
the
back
streets
of
palermo
felt
friendly
not
huge
and
rather
horrible
like
naples
near
the
port
the
theatre
was
a
little
hole
opening
simply
off
the
street
there
was
no
one
in
the
little
ticket
box
so
we
walked
past
the
a
shabby
old
man
with
a
long
hurried
up
and
made
us
places
on
the
back
benches
and
hushed
us
when
we
spoke
of
tickets
the
play
was
in
progress
a
was
just
having
a
tussle
with
a
knight
in
brilliant
brass
armour
and
my
heart
came
into
my
mouth
the
audience
consisted
mostly
of
boys
gazing
with
frantic
interest
on
the
bright
stage
there
was
a
sprinkling
of
soldiers
and
elderly
men
the
place
was
packed
about
fifty
souls
crowded
on
narrow
little
ribbons
of
benches
so
close
one
behind
the
other
that
the
end
of
the
man
in
front
of
me
continually
encroached
and
sat
on
my
knee
i
saw
on
a
notice
that
the
price
of
entry
was
forty
centimes
we
had
come
in
towards
the
end
of
the
performance
and
so
sat
rather
bewildered
unable
to
follow
the
story
was
the
inevitable
paladins
of
france
one
heard
the
names
again
and
again
but
the
story
was
told
in
dialect
hard
to
follow
i
was
charmed
by
the
figures
the
scene
was
very
simple
showing
the
interior
of
a
castle
but
the
figures
which
were
about
of
human
size
were
wonderful
in
their
brilliant
glittering
gold
armour
and
their
martial
prancing
motions
all
were
knights
even
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
babylon
she
was
distinguished
only
by
her
long
hair
all
were
in
the
beautiful
glittering
armour
with
helmets
and
visors
that
could
be
let
down
at
will
i
am
told
this
armour
has
been
handed
down
for
many
generations
it
certainly
is
lovely
one
actor
alone
was
not
in
armour
the
wizard
magicce
or
malvigge
the
merlin
of
the
paladins
he
was
in
a
long
scarlet
robe
edged
with
fur
and
wore
a
scarlet
hat
so
we
watched
the
dragon
leap
and
twist
and
get
the
knight
by
the
leg
and
then
perish
we
watched
the
knights
burst
into
the
castle
we
watched
the
wonderful
embraces
of
the
delivered
knights
orlando
and
his
bosom
friend
and
the
little
dwarf
clashing
their
armoured
breasts
to
the
breasts
of
their
brothers
and
deliverers
we
watched
the
tears
and
then
the
statue
of
the
witch
suddenly
go
up
in
flames
at
which
a
roar
of
exultation
from
the
boys
then
it
was
over
the
theatre
was
empty
in
a
moment
but
the
proprietors
and
the
two
men
who
sat
near
us
would
not
let
us
go
we
must
wait
for
the
next
performance
my
neighbour
a
fat
jolly
man
told
me
all
about
it
his
neighbour
a
handsome
tipsy
man
kept
contradicting
and
saying
it
was
so
but
my
fat
neighbour
winked
at
me
not
to
take
offence
this
story
of
the
paladins
of
france
lasted
three
nights
we
had
come
on
the
middle
night
of
course
but
no
matter
each
night
was
a
complete
story
i
am
sorry
i
have
forgotten
the
names
of
the
knights
but
the
story
was
that
orlando
and
his
friend
and
the
little
dwarf
owing
to
the
tricks
of
that
same
dwarf
who
belonged
to
the
paladins
had
been
captured
and
immured
in
the
enchanted
castle
of
the
ghastly
old
witch
who
lived
on
the
blood
of
christians
it
was
now
the
business
of
rinaldo
and
the
rest
of
the
paladins
by
the
help
of
magicce
the
wizard
to
release
their
captured
brethren
from
the
ghoulish
old
witch
so
much
i
made
out
of
the
fat
man
story
while
the
theatre
was
filling
he
knew
every
detail
of
the
whole
paladin
cycle
and
it
is
evident
the
paladin
cycle
has
lots
of
versions
for
the
handsome
tipsy
neighbour
kept
saying
he
was
wrong
he
was
wrong
and
giving
different
stories
and
shouting
for
a
jury
to
come
and
say
who
was
right
he
or
my
fat
friend
a
jury
gathered
and
a
storm
began
to
rise
but
the
stout
proprietor
with
a
came
and
quenched
the
noise
telling
the
handsome
tipsy
man
he
knew
too
much
and
was
asked
whereupon
the
tipsy
one
sulked
ah
said
my
friend
could
i
come
on
friday
friday
was
a
great
night
on
friday
they
were
giving
i
beati
paoli
the
blessed
pauls
he
pointed
to
the
walls
where
were
the
placards
announcing
the
blessed
pauls
these
pauls
were
evidently
some
awful
secret
society
with
masking
hoods
and
daggers
and
awful
eyes
looking
through
the
holes
i
said
were
they
assassins
like
the
black
hand
by
no
means
by
no
means
the
blessed
pauls
were
a
society
for
the
protection
of
the
poor
their
business
was
to
track
down
and
murder
the
oppressive
rich
ah
they
were
a
wonderful
a
splendid
society
were
they
said
i
a
sort
of
camorra
ah
on
the
contrary
here
he
lapsed
into
a
tense
voice
they
hated
the
camorra
these
the
blest
pauls
were
the
powerful
and
terrible
enemy
of
the
grand
camorra
for
the
grand
camorra
oppresses
the
poor
and
therefore
the
pauls
track
down
in
secret
the
leaders
of
the
grand
camorra
and
assassinate
them
or
bring
them
to
the
fearful
hooded
tribunal
which
utters
the
dread
verdict
of
the
beati
paoli
and
when
once
the
beati
paoli
have
decreed
a
man
death
all
over
ah
bellissimo
bellissimo
why
do
i
come
on
friday
it
seems
to
me
a
queer
moral
for
the
urchins
and
gazing
at
the
drop
scene
they
are
all
males
urchins
or
men
i
ask
my
fat
friend
why
there
are
no
women
no
girls
ah
he
says
the
theatre
is
so
small
but
i
say
if
there
is
room
for
all
the
boys
and
men
there
is
the
same
room
for
girls
and
women
oh
no
not
in
this
small
theatre
besides
this
is
nothing
for
women
not
that
there
is
anything
improper
he
hastens
to
add
not
at
all
but
what
should
women
and
girls
be
doing
at
the
marionette
show
it
was
an
affair
for
males
i
agreed
with
him
really
and
was
thankful
we
had
a
lot
of
smirking
twitching
girls
and
lasses
in
the
audience
this
male
audience
was
so
tense
and
pure
in
its
attention
but
hist
the
play
is
going
to
begin
a
lad
is
grinding
a
broken
under
the
stage
the
padrone
yells
with
a
roar
and
reaching
over
pokes
obstreperous
boys
with
his
long
like
a
beadle
in
church
when
the
curtain
rises
the
piano
stops
and
there
is
dead
silence
on
swings
a
knight
glittering
marching
with
that
curious
hippety
lilt
and
gazing
round
with
fixed
and
martial
eyes
he
begins
the
prologue
telling
us
where
we
are
and
dramatically
he
waves
his
sword
and
stamps
his
foot
and
wonderfully
sounds
his
male
martial
rather
husky
voice
then
the
paladins
his
companions
who
are
to
accompany
him
swing
one
by
one
onto
the
stage
till
they
are
five
in
all
handsome
knights
including
the
babylonian
princess
and
the
knight
of
britain
they
stand
in
a
handsome
glittering
line
and
then
comes
merlin
in
his
red
robe
merlin
has
a
bright
fair
rather
chubby
face
and
blue
eyes
and
seems
to
typify
the
northern
intelligence
he
now
tells
them
in
many
words
how
to
proceed
and
what
is
to
be
done
so
then
the
glittering
knights
are
ready
are
they
ready
rinaldo
flourishes
his
sword
with
the
wonderful
cry
andiamo
let
us
go
and
the
others
respond
andiamo
splendid
word
the
first
enemy
were
the
knights
of
spain
in
red
kirtles
and
half
turbans
with
these
a
terrible
fight
first
of
all
rushes
in
the
knight
of
britain
he
is
the
boaster
who
always
in
words
does
everything
but
in
fact
poor
knight
of
britain
he
falls
lamed
the
four
paladins
have
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
glittering
watching
the
fray
forth
now
steps
another
knight
and
the
fight
recommences
terrible
is
the
smacking
of
swords
terrible
the
gasps
from
behind
the
dropped
visors
till
at
last
the
knight
of
spain
falls
and
the
paladin
stands
with
his
foot
on
the
dead
then
loud
acclamations
from
the
paladins
and
yells
of
joy
from
the
audience
yells
the
padrone
flourishing
the
dead
silence
and
the
story
goes
on
the
knight
of
britain
of
course
claims
to
have
slain
the
foe
and
the
audience
faintly
jeeringly
hisses
he
always
the
boaster
and
he
never
does
anything
the
knight
of
britain
whispers
my
fat
friend
he
has
forgotten
my
nationality
i
wonder
if
the
knight
of
britain
is
pure
tradition
or
if
a
political
touch
of
today
has
crept
in
however
this
fray
is
over
merlin
comes
to
advise
for
the
next
move
and
are
we
ready
we
are
ready
again
the
word
is
yelled
out
and
they
set
off
at
first
one
is
all
engaged
watching
the
figures
their
brilliance
their
blank
martial
stare
their
sudden
angular
gestures
there
is
something
extremely
suggestive
in
them
how
much
better
they
fit
the
old
than
living
people
would
do
nay
if
we
are
going
to
have
human
beings
on
the
stage
they
should
be
masked
and
disguised
for
in
fact
drama
is
enacted
by
symbolic
creatures
formed
out
of
human
consciousness
puppets
if
you
like
but
not
human
our
stage
is
all
wrong
so
boring
in
its
personality
gradually
however
i
found
that
my
eyes
were
of
minor
importance
gradually
it
was
the
voice
that
gained
hold
of
the
blood
it
is
a
strong
rather
husky
male
voice
that
acts
direct
on
the
blood
not
on
the
mind
again
the
old
male
adam
began
to
stir
at
the
roots
of
my
soul
again
the
old
indifference
the
rich
untamed
male
blood
rocked
down
my
veins
what
does
one
care
what
does
one
care
for
precept
and
mental
dictation
is
there
not
the
massive
brilliant
recklessness
in
the
male
soul
summed
up
in
the
sudden
word
andiamo
let
us
go
on
andiamo
let
us
go
hell
knows
where
but
let
us
go
on
the
splendid
recklessness
and
passion
that
knows
no
precept
and
no
whose
very
molten
spontaneity
is
its
own
guide
i
loved
the
voices
of
the
paladins
rinaldo
voice
and
voice
the
voice
of
men
once
more
men
who
are
not
to
be
tutored
to
be
sure
there
was
merlin
making
his
long
speeches
in
rather
a
chuntering
prosy
tone
but
who
was
he
was
he
a
paladin
and
a
splendour
not
he
a
chunterer
it
is
the
reckless
blood
which
achieves
all
the
of
the
mental
and
moral
intelligence
is
but
a
subsidiary
help
a
mere
instrument
the
dragon
was
splendid
i
have
seen
dragons
in
wagner
at
covent
garden
and
at
the
theater
in
munich
and
they
were
ridiculous
but
this
dragon
simply
frightened
me
with
his
leaping
and
twisting
and
when
he
seized
the
knight
by
the
leg
my
blood
ran
cold
with
smoke
and
sulphur
leaps
in
beelzebub
but
he
is
merely
the
servant
of
the
great
old
witch
he
is
black
and
grinning
and
he
flourishes
his
posterior
and
his
tail
but
he
is
curiously
inefficacious
a
sort
of
lackey
of
wicked
powers
the
old
witch
with
her
grey
hair
and
staring
eyes
succeeds
in
being
ghastly
with
just
a
touch
she
would
be
a
tall
benevolent
old
lady
but
listen
to
her
hear
her
horrible
female
voice
with
its
scraping
yells
of
evil
lustfulness
yes
she
fills
me
with
horror
and
i
am
staggered
to
find
how
i
believe
in
her
as
evil
principle
beelzebub
poor
devil
is
only
one
of
her
instruments
it
is
her
old
horrible
grinning
female
soul
which
locks
up
the
heroes
and
which
sends
forth
the
awful
and
almost
omnipotent
malevolence
this
old
ghastly
is
the
very
core
of
mischief
and
i
felt
my
heart
getting
as
hot
against
her
as
the
hearts
of
the
lads
in
the
audience
were
red
deep
hate
i
felt
of
that
symbolic
old
poor
male
beelzebub
is
her
loutish
slave
and
it
takes
all
intelligence
and
all
the
surging
hot
urgency
of
the
paladins
to
conquer
her
she
will
never
be
finally
destroyed
she
will
never
finally
die
till
her
statue
which
is
immured
in
the
vaults
of
the
castle
is
oh
it
was
a
very
psychoanalytic
performance
altogether
and
one
could
give
a
very
good
freudian
analysis
of
but
behold
this
image
of
the
witch
this
white
submerged
of
woman
which
rules
from
the
deeps
of
the
unconscious
behold
the
reckless
untamable
male
knights
will
do
for
it
as
the
statue
goes
up
in
flame
it
is
only
paper
over
wires
the
audience
yells
and
yells
again
and
would
god
the
symbolic
act
were
really
achieved
it
is
only
little
boys
who
yell
men
merely
smile
at
the
trick
they
know
well
enough
the
white
image
endures
so
it
is
over
the
knights
look
at
us
once
more
orlando
hero
of
heroes
has
a
slight
inward
cast
of
the
eyes
this
gives
him
that
look
of
almost
fierce
which
these
people
adore
the
look
of
a
man
who
does
not
think
but
whose
heart
is
all
the
time
red
hot
with
burning
generous
this
is
what
they
adore
so
my
knights
go
they
all
have
wonderful
faces
and
are
so
splendidly
glittering
and
male
i
am
sorry
they
will
be
laid
in
a
box
now
there
is
a
great
gasp
of
relief
the
piano
starts
its
lame
rattle
somebody
looking
round
laughs
and
we
all
look
round
and
seated
on
the
top
of
the
ticket
office
is
a
fat
solemn
urchin
of
two
or
three
years
hands
folded
over
his
stomach
his
forehead
big
and
blank
like
some
queer
little
buddha
the
audience
laughs
with
that
southern
sympathy
physical
sympathy
that
is
what
they
love
to
feel
and
to
arouse
but
there
is
a
little
in
front
of
the
jerks
out
a
little
fat
flat
caricature
of
a
neapolitan
and
from
the
opposite
side
jerks
the
tall
caricature
of
a
sicilian
they
jerk
towards
one
another
and
bump
into
one
another
with
a
smack
and
smack
goes
the
neapolitan
down
on
his
posterior
and
the
boys
howl
with
joy
it
is
the
eternal
collision
between
the
two
peoples
neapolitan
and
sicilian
now
goes
on
a
lot
of
fooling
between
the
two
clowns
in
the
two
dialects
alas
i
can
hardly
understand
anything
at
all
but
it
sounds
comic
and
looks
very
funny
the
neapolitan
of
course
gets
most
of
the
knocks
and
there
seems
to
be
no
indecency
at
all
unless
the
boys
howl
and
rock
with
joy
and
no
one
says
silenzio
but
it
is
over
all
is
over
the
theatre
empties
in
a
moment
and
i
shake
hands
with
my
fat
neighbour
affectionately
and
in
the
right
spirit
truly
i
loved
them
all
in
the
theatre
the
generous
hot
southern
blood
so
subtle
and
spontaneous
that
asks
for
blood
contact
not
for
mental
communion
or
spirit
sympathy
i
was
sorry
to
leave
them
finis
