introduction
it
costs
me
nothing
to
feel
that
i
am
it
is
no
burden
to
me
and
yet
if
the
mental
physical
chemical
and
other
innumerable
facts
concerning
all
branches
of
knowledge
which
have
united
in
myself
could
be
broken
up
they
would
prove
endless
it
is
some
untold
mystery
of
unity
in
me
that
has
the
simplicity
of
the
infinite
and
reduces
the
immense
mass
of
multitude
to
a
single
point
this
one
in
me
knows
the
universe
of
the
many
but
in
whatever
it
knows
it
knows
the
one
in
different
aspects
it
knows
this
room
only
because
this
room
is
one
to
it
in
spite
of
the
seeming
contradiction
of
the
endless
facts
contained
in
the
single
fact
of
the
room
its
knowledge
of
a
tree
is
the
knowledge
of
a
unity
which
appears
in
the
aspect
of
a
tree
this
one
in
me
is
creative
its
creations
are
a
pastime
through
which
it
gives
expression
to
an
ideal
of
unity
in
its
endless
show
of
variety
such
are
its
pictures
poems
music
in
which
it
finds
joy
only
because
they
reveal
the
perfect
forms
of
an
inherent
unity
this
one
in
me
not
only
seeks
unity
in
knowledge
for
its
understanding
and
creates
images
of
unity
for
its
delight
it
also
seeks
union
in
love
for
its
fulfilment
it
seeks
itself
in
others
this
is
a
fact
which
would
be
absurd
had
there
been
no
great
medium
of
truth
to
give
it
reality
in
love
we
find
a
joy
which
is
ultimate
because
it
is
the
ultimate
truth
therefore
it
is
said
in
the
upanishads
that
the
is
the
one
is
infinite
that
the
is
the
one
is
love
to
give
perfect
expression
to
the
one
the
infinite
through
the
harmony
of
the
many
to
the
one
the
love
through
the
sacrifice
of
self
is
the
object
alike
of
our
individual
life
and
our
society

civility
is
beauty
of
behaviour
it
requires
for
its
perfection
patience
and
an
environment
of
leisure
for
genuine
courtesy
is
a
creation
like
pictures
like
music
it
is
a
harmonious
blending
of
voice
gesture
and
movement
words
and
action
in
which
generosity
of
conduct
is
expressed
it
reveals
the
man
himself
and
has
no
ulterior
purpose
our
needs
are
always
in
a
hurry
they
rush
and
hustle
they
are
rude
and
unceremonious
they
have
no
surplus
of
leisure
no
patience
for
anything
else
but
fulfilment
of
purpose
we
frequently
see
in
our
country
at
the
present
day
men
utilising
empty
kerosene
cans
for
carrying
water
these
cans
are
emblems
of
discourtesy
they
are
curt
and
abrupt
they
have
not
the
least
shame
for
their
unmannerliness
they
do
not
care
to
be
ever
so
slightly
more
than
useful
the
instruments
of
our
necessity
assert
that
we
must
have
food
shelter
clothes
comforts
and
convenience
and
yet
men
spend
an
immense
amount
of
their
time
and
resources
in
contradicting
this
assertion
to
prove
that
they
are
not
a
mere
living
catalogue
of
endless
wants
that
there
is
in
them
an
ideal
of
perfection
a
sense
of
unity
which
is
a
harmony
between
parts
and
a
harmony
with
surroundings
the
quality
of
the
infinite
is
not
the
magnitude
of
extension
it
is
in
the
the
mystery
of
unity
facts
occupy
endless
time
and
space
but
the
truth
comprehending
them
all
has
no
dimension
it
is
one
wherever
our
heart
touches
the
one
in
the
small
or
the
big
it
finds
the
touch
of
the
infinite
i
was
speaking
to
some
one
of
the
joy
we
have
in
our
personality
i
said
it
was
because
we
were
made
conscious
by
it
of
a
spirit
of
unity
within
ourselves
he
answered
that
he
had
no
such
feeling
of
joy
about
himself
but
i
was
sure
he
exaggerated
in
all
probability
he
had
been
suffering
from
some
break
of
harmony
between
his
surroundings
and
the
spirit
of
unity
within
him
proving
all
the
more
strongly
its
truth
the
meaning
of
health
comes
home
to
us
with
painful
force
when
disease
disturbs
it
since
health
expresses
the
unity
of
the
vital
functions
and
is
accordingly
joyful
life
tragedies
occur
not
to
demonstrate
their
own
reality
but
to
reveal
that
eternal
principle
of
joy
in
life
to
which
they
gave
a
rude
shaking
it
is
the
object
of
this
oneness
in
us
to
realise
its
infinity
by
perfect
union
of
love
with
others
all
obstacles
to
this
union
create
misery
giving
rise
to
the
baser
passions
that
are
expressions
of
finitude
of
that
separateness
which
is
negative
and
therefore
the
joy
of
unity
within
ourselves
seeking
expression
becomes
creative
whereas
our
desire
for
the
fulfilment
of
our
needs
is
constructive
the
water
vessel
taken
as
a
vessel
only
raises
the
question
why
does
it
exist
at
all
through
its
fitness
of
construction
it
offers
the
apology
for
its
existence
but
where
it
is
a
work
of
beauty
it
has
no
question
to
answer
it
has
nothing
to
do
but
to
be
it
reveals
in
its
form
a
unity
to
which
all
that
seems
various
in
it
is
so
related
that
in
a
mysterious
manner
it
strikes
sympathetic
chords
to
the
music
of
unity
in
our
own
being
what
is
the
truth
of
this
world
it
is
not
in
the
masses
of
substance
not
in
the
number
of
things
but
in
their
relatedness
which
neither
can
be
counted
nor
measured
nor
abstracted
it
is
not
in
the
materials
which
are
many
but
in
the
expression
which
is
one
all
our
knowledge
of
things
is
knowing
them
in
their
relation
to
the
universe
in
that
relation
which
is
truth
a
drop
of
water
is
not
a
particular
assortment
of
elements
it
is
the
miracle
of
a
harmonious
mutuality
in
which
the
two
reveal
the
one
no
amount
of
analysis
can
reveal
to
us
this
mystery
of
unity
matter
is
an
abstraction
we
shall
never
be
able
to
realise
what
it
is
for
our
world
of
reality
does
not
acknowledge
it
even
the
giant
forces
of
the
world
centripetal
and
centrifugal
are
kept
out
of
our
recognition
they
are
the
not
admitted
into
the
of
creation
but
light
and
sound
come
to
us
in
their
gay
dresses
as
troubadours
singing
serenades
before
the
windows
of
the
senses
what
is
constantly
before
us
claiming
our
attention
is
not
the
kitchen
but
the
feast
not
the
anatomy
of
the
world
but
its
countenance
there
is
the
dancing
ring
of
seasons
the
elusive
play
of
lights
and
shadows
of
wind
and
water
the
wings
of
erratic
life
flitting
between
birth
and
death
the
importance
of
these
does
not
lie
in
their
existence
as
mere
facts
but
in
their
language
of
harmony
the
of
our
own
soul
through
which
they
are
communicated
to
us
we
grow
out
of
touch
with
this
great
truth
we
forget
to
accept
its
invitation
and
its
hospitality
when
in
quest
of
external
success
our
works
become
unspiritual
and
unexpressive
this
is
what
wordsworth
complained
of
when
he
said
the
world
is
too
much
with
us
late
and
soon
getting
and
spending
we
lay
waste
our
powers
little
we
see
in
nature
that
is
ours
but
it
is
not
because
the
world
has
grown
too
familiar
to
us
on
the
contrary
it
is
because
we
do
not
see
it
in
its
aspect
of
unity
because
we
are
driven
to
distraction
by
our
pursuit
of
the
fragmentary
materials
as
materials
are
savage
they
are
solitary
they
are
ready
to
hurt
one
another
they
are
like
our
individual
impulses
seeking
the
unlimited
freedom
of
wilfulness
left
to
themselves
they
are
destructive
but
directly
an
ideal
of
unity
raises
its
banner
in
their
centre
it
brings
these
rebellious
forces
under
its
sway
and
creation
is
creation
which
is
peace
which
is
the
unity
of
perfect
relationship
our
greed
for
eating
is
in
itself
ugly
and
selfish
it
has
no
sense
of
decorum
but
when
brought
under
the
ideal
of
social
fellowship
it
is
regulated
and
made
ornamental
it
is
changed
into
a
daily
festivity
of
life
in
human
nature
sexual
passion
is
fiercely
individual
and
destructive
but
dominated
by
the
ideal
of
love
it
has
been
made
to
flower
into
a
perfection
of
beauty
becoming
in
its
best
expression
symbolical
of
the
spiritual
truth
in
man
which
is
his
kinship
of
love
with
the
infinite
thus
we
find
it
is
the
one
which
expresses
itself
in
creation
and
the
many
by
giving
up
opposition
make
the
revelation
of
unity
perfect
ii
i
remember
when
i
was
a
child
that
a
row
of
cocoanut
trees
by
our
garden
wall
with
their
branches
beckoning
the
rising
sun
on
the
horizon
gave
me
a
companionship
as
living
as
i
was
myself
i
know
it
was
my
imagination
which
transmuted
the
world
around
me
into
my
own
imagination
which
seeks
unity
which
deals
with
it
but
we
have
to
consider
that
this
companionship
was
true
that
the
universe
in
which
i
was
born
had
in
it
an
element
profoundly
akin
to
my
own
imaginative
mind
one
which
wakens
in
all
children
natures
the
creator
whose
pleasure
is
in
interweaving
the
web
of
creation
with
his
own
patterns
of
strands
it
is
something
akin
to
us
and
therefore
harmonious
to
our
imagination
when
we
find
some
strings
vibrating
in
unison
with
others
we
know
that
this
sympathy
carries
in
it
an
eternal
reality
the
fact
that
the
world
stirs
our
imagination
in
sympathy
tells
us
that
this
creative
imagination
is
a
common
truth
both
in
us
and
in
the
heart
of
existence
wordsworth
says
i
rather
be
a
pagan
suckled
in
a
creed
outworn
so
might
i
standing
on
this
pleasant
lea
have
glimpses
that
would
make
me
less
forlorn
have
sight
of
proteus
rising
from
the
sea
or
hear
old
triton
blow
his
wreathèd
horn
in
this
passage
the
poet
says
we
are
less
forlorn
in
a
world
which
we
meet
with
our
imagination
that
can
only
be
possible
if
through
our
imagination
is
revealed
behind
all
appearances
the
reality
which
gives
the
touch
of
companionship
that
is
to
say
something
which
has
an
affinity
to
us
an
immense
amount
of
our
activity
is
engaged
in
making
images
not
for
serving
any
useful
purpose
or
formulating
rational
propositions
but
for
giving
varied
responses
to
the
varied
touches
of
this
reality
in
this
the
child
creates
his
own
world
in
answer
to
the
world
in
which
he
finds
himself
the
child
in
us
finds
glimpses
of
his
eternal
playmate
from
behind
the
veil
of
things
as
proteus
rising
from
the
sea
or
triton
blowing
his
wreathèd
horn
and
the
playmate
is
the
reality
that
makes
it
possible
for
the
child
to
find
delight
in
activities
which
do
not
inform
or
bring
assistance
but
merely
express
there
is
an
joy
in
the
infinite
which
inspires
in
us
our
joy
in
imagining
the
rhythm
of
cosmic
motion
produces
in
our
mind
the
emotion
which
is
creative
a
poet
has
said
about
his
destiny
as
a
dreamer
about
the
worthlessness
of
his
dreams
and
yet
their
permanence
i
hang
men
my
heedless
head
and
my
fruit
is
dreams
as
theirs
is
bread
the
goodly
men
and
the
sleeper
time
shall
reap
but
after
the
reaper
the
world
shall
glean
to
me
me
the
sleeper
the
dream
persists
it
is
more
real
than
even
bread
which
has
substance
and
use
the
painted
canvas
is
durable
and
substantial
it
has
for
its
production
and
transport
to
market
a
whole
array
of
machines
and
factories
but
the
picture
which
no
factory
can
produce
is
a
dream
a
and
yet
it
not
the
canvas
has
the
meaning
of
ultimate
reality
a
poet
describes
autumn
i
saw
old
autumn
in
the
misty
morn
stand
shadowless
like
silence
listening
to
silence
for
no
lonely
bird
would
sing
into
his
hollow
ear
from
woods
forlorn
of
april
another
poet
sings
april
april
laugh
thy
girlish
laughter
then
the
moment
after
weep
thy
girlish
tears
april
that
mine
ears
like
a
lover
greetest
if
i
tell
thee
sweetest
all
my
hopes
and
fears
april
april
laugh
thy
golden
laughter
but
the
moment
after
weep
thy
golden
tears
this
autumn
this
april
they
nothing
but
phantasy
let
us
suppose
that
the
man
from
the
moon
comes
to
the
earth
and
listens
to
some
music
in
a
gramophone
he
seeks
for
the
origin
of
the
delight
produced
in
his
mind
the
facts
before
him
are
a
cabinet
made
of
wood
and
a
revolving
disc
producing
sound
but
the
one
thing
which
is
neither
seen
nor
can
be
explained
is
the
truth
of
the
music
which
his
personality
must
immediately
acknowledge
as
a
personal
message
it
is
neither
in
the
wood
nor
in
the
disc
nor
in
the
sound
of
the
notes
if
the
man
from
the
moon
be
a
poet
as
can
reasonably
be
supposed
he
will
write
about
a
fairy
imprisoned
in
that
box
who
sits
spinning
fabrics
of
songs
expressing
her
cry
for
a
magic
casement
opening
on
the
foam
of
some
perilous
sea
in
a
fairyland
forlorn
it
will
not
be
literally
but
essentially
true
the
facts
of
the
gramophone
make
us
aware
of
the
laws
of
sound
but
the
music
gives
us
personal
companionship
the
bare
facts
about
april
are
alternate
sunshine
and
showers
but
the
subtle
blending
of
shadows
and
lights
of
murmurs
and
movements
in
april
gives
us
not
mere
shocks
of
sensation
but
unity
of
joy
as
does
music
therefore
when
a
poet
sees
the
vision
of
a
girl
in
april
even
a
downright
materialist
is
in
sympathy
with
him
but
we
know
that
the
same
individual
would
be
menacingly
angry
if
the
law
of
heredity
or
a
geometrical
problem
were
described
as
a
girl
or
a
even
as
a
cat
or
a
camel
for
these
intellectual
abstractions
have
no
magical
touch
for
our
of
imagination
they
are
no
dreams
as
are
the
harmony
of
leaves
glistening
in
the
sun
and
pale
clouds
floating
in
the
blue
the
ultimate
truth
of
our
personality
is
that
we
are
no
mere
biologists
or
geometricians
we
are
the
dreamers
of
dreams
we
are
the
this
dreaming
or
is
not
a
function
of
the
it
is
the
creative
impulse
which
makes
songs
not
only
with
words
and
tunes
lines
and
colours
but
with
stones
and
metals
with
ideas
and
men
with
wonderful
deathless
ditties
we
build
up
the
world
great
cities
and
out
of
a
fabulous
story
we
fashion
an
empire
glory
i
have
been
told
by
a
scholar
friend
of
mine
that
by
constant
practice
in
logic
he
has
weakened
his
natural
instinct
of
faith
the
reason
is
faith
is
the
spectator
in
us
which
finds
the
meaning
of
the
drama
from
the
unity
of
the
performance
but
logic
lures
us
into
the
greenroom
where
there
is
stagecraft
but
no
drama
at
all
and
then
this
logic
nods
its
head
and
wearily
talks
about
disillusionment
but
the
greenroom
dealing
with
its
fragments
looks
foolish
when
questioned
or
wears
the
sneering
smile
of
mephistopheles
for
it
does
not
have
the
secret
of
unity
which
is
somewhere
else
it
is
for
faith
to
answer
unity
comes
to
us
from
the
one
and
the
one
in
ourselves
opens
the
door
and
receives
it
with
joy
the
function
of
poetry
and
the
arts
is
to
remind
us
that
the
greenroom
is
the
greyest
of
illusions
and
the
reality
is
the
drama
presented
before
us
all
its
paint
and
tinsel
masks
and
pageantry
made
one
in
art
the
ropes
and
wheels
perish
the
stage
is
changed
but
the
dream
which
is
drama
remains
true
for
there
remains
the
eternal
dreamer
iii
poetry
and
the
arts
cherish
in
them
the
profound
faith
of
man
in
the
unity
of
his
being
with
all
existence
the
final
truth
of
which
is
the
truth
of
personality
it
is
a
religion
directly
apprehended
and
not
a
system
of
metaphysics
to
be
analysed
and
argued
we
know
in
our
personal
experience
what
our
creations
are
and
we
instinctively
know
through
it
what
creation
around
us
means
when
keats
said
in
his
ode
to
a
grecian
urn
thou
silent
form
dost
tease
us
out
of
thought
as
doth
eternity
he
felt
the
ineffable
which
is
in
all
forms
of
perfection
the
mystery
of
the
one
which
takes
us
beyond
all
thought
into
the
immediate
touch
of
the
infinite
this
is
the
mystery
which
is
for
a
poet
to
realise
and
to
reveal
it
comes
out
in
keats
poems
with
struggling
gleams
through
consciousness
of
suffering
and
despair
spite
of
despondence
of
the
inhuman
dearth
of
noble
natures
of
the
gloomy
days
of
all
the
unhealthy
and
ways
made
for
our
searching
yes
in
spite
of
all
some
shape
of
beauty
moves
away
the
pall
from
our
dark
spirits
in
this
there
is
a
suggestion
that
truth
reveals
itself
in
beauty
for
if
beauty
were
mere
accident
a
rent
in
the
eternal
fabric
of
things
then
it
would
hurt
would
be
defeated
by
the
antagonism
of
facts
beauty
is
no
phantasy
it
has
the
everlasting
meaning
of
reality
the
facts
that
cause
despondence
and
gloom
are
mere
mist
and
when
through
the
mist
beauty
breaks
out
in
momentary
gleams
we
realise
that
peace
is
true
and
not
conflict
love
is
true
and
not
hatred
and
truth
is
the
one
not
the
disjointed
multitude
we
realise
that
creation
is
the
perpetual
harmony
between
the
infinite
ideal
of
perfection
and
the
eternal
continuity
of
its
realisation
that
so
long
as
there
is
no
absolute
separation
between
the
positive
ideal
and
the
material
obstacle
to
its
attainment
we
need
not
be
afraid
of
suffering
and
loss
this
is
the
poet
religion
those
who
are
habituated
to
the
rigid
framework
of
sectarian
creeds
will
find
such
a
religion
as
this
too
indefinite
and
elastic
no
doubt
it
is
so
but
only
because
its
ambition
is
not
to
shackle
the
infinite
and
tame
it
for
domestic
use
but
rather
to
help
our
consciousness
to
emancipate
itself
from
materialism
it
is
as
indefinite
as
the
morning
and
yet
as
luminous
it
calls
our
thoughts
feelings
and
actions
into
freedom
and
feeds
them
with
light
in
the
religion
we
find
no
doctrine
or
injunction
but
rather
the
attitude
of
our
entire
being
towards
a
truth
which
is
ever
to
be
revealed
in
its
own
endless
creation
in
dogmatic
religion
all
questions
are
definitely
answered
all
doubts
are
finally
laid
to
rest
but
the
poet
religion
is
fluid
like
the
atmosphere
round
the
earth
where
lights
and
shadows
play
and
the
wind
like
a
shepherd
boy
plays
upon
its
reeds
among
flocks
of
clouds
it
never
undertakes
to
lead
anybody
anywhere
to
any
solid
conclusion
yet
it
reveals
endless
spheres
of
light
because
it
has
no
walls
round
itself
it
acknowledges
the
facts
of
evil
it
openly
admits
the
weariness
the
fever
and
the
fret
in
the
world
where
men
sit
and
hear
each
other
groan
yet
it
remembers
that
in
spite
of
all
there
is
the
song
of
the
nightingale
and
haply
the
queen
moon
is
on
her
throne
and
there
is
white
hawthorn
and
the
pastoral
eglantine
violets
covered
up
in
leaves
and
eldest
child
the
coming
full
of
dewy
wine
the
murmurous
haunt
of
flies
on
summer
eves
but
all
this
has
not
the
definiteness
of
an
answer
it
has
only
the
music
that
teases
us
out
of
thought
as
it
fills
our
being
let
me
read
a
translation
from
an
eastern
poet
to
show
how
this
idea
comes
out
in
a
poem
in
bengali
in
the
morning
i
awoke
at
the
flutter
of
thy
lady
of
my
voyage
and
i
left
the
shore
to
follow
the
beckoning
waves
i
asked
thee
does
the
ripen
in
the
island
beyond
the
blue
the
silence
of
thy
smile
fell
on
my
question
like
the
silence
of
sunlight
on
waves
the
day
passed
on
through
storm
and
through
calm
the
perplexed
winds
changed
their
course
time
after
time
and
the
sea
moaned
i
asked
thee
does
thy
stand
somewhere
beyond
the
dying
embers
of
the
day
funeral
pyre
no
answer
came
from
thee
only
thine
eyes
smiled
like
the
edge
of
a
sunset
cloud
it
is
night
thy
figure
grows
dim
in
the
dark
thy
hair
flits
on
my
cheek
and
thrills
my
sadness
with
its
scent
my
hands
grope
to
touch
the
hem
of
thy
robe
and
i
ask
is
there
thy
garden
of
death
beyond
the
stars
lady
of
my
voyage
where
thy
silence
blossoms
into
songs
thy
smile
shines
in
the
heart
of
the
hush
like
the
of
midnight
iv
in
shelley
we
clearly
see
the
growth
of
his
religion
through
periods
of
vagueness
and
doubt
struggle
and
searching
but
he
did
at
length
come
to
a
positive
utterance
of
his
faith
though
he
died
young
its
final
expression
is
in
his
hymn
to
intellectual
beauty
by
the
title
of
the
poem
the
poet
evidently
means
a
beauty
that
is
not
merely
a
passive
quality
of
particular
things
but
a
spirit
that
manifests
itself
through
the
apparent
antagonism
of
the
unintellectual
life
this
hymn
rang
out
of
his
heart
when
he
came
to
the
end
of
his
pilgrimage
and
stood
face
to
face
with
the
divinity
glimpses
of
which
had
already
filled
his
soul
with
restlessness
all
his
experiences
of
beauty
had
ever
teased
him
with
the
question
as
to
what
was
its
truth
somewhere
he
sings
of
a
nosegay
which
he
makes
of
violets
daisies
tender
bluebells
that
tall
flower
that
wets
like
a
child
half
in
tenderness
and
mirth
its
mother
face
with
tears
he
ends
by
saying
and
then
elate
and
gay
i
hastened
to
the
spot
whence
i
had
come
that
i
might
there
present
it
to
whom
this
question
even
though
not
answered
carries
a
significance
a
creation
of
beauty
suggests
a
fulfilment
which
is
the
fulfilment
of
love
we
have
heard
some
poets
scoff
at
it
in
bitterness
and
despair
but
it
is
like
a
sick
child
beating
its
own
is
a
sickness
of
faith
which
hurts
truth
but
proves
it
by
its
very
pain
and
anger
and
the
faith
itself
is
this
that
beauty
is
the
of
the
one
to
the
other
one
in
the
first
part
of
his
hymn
to
intellectual
beauty
shelley
dwells
on
the
inconstancy
and
evanescence
of
the
manifestation
of
beauty
which
imparts
to
it
an
appearance
of
frailty
and
unreality
like
hues
and
harmonies
of
evening
like
clouds
in
starlight
widely
spread
like
memory
of
music
fled
this
he
says
rouses
in
our
mind
the
question
why
aught
should
fail
and
fade
that
once
is
shown
why
fear
and
dream
and
death
and
birth
cast
on
the
daylight
of
this
earth
such
gloom
man
has
such
a
scope
for
love
and
hate
despondency
and
hope
the
poet
own
answer
to
this
question
is
man
were
immortal
and
omnipotent
didst
thou
unknown
and
awful
as
thou
art
keep
with
thy
glorious
train
firm
state
within
his
heart
this
very
elusiveness
of
beauty
suggests
the
vision
of
immortality
and
of
omnipotence
and
stimulates
the
effort
in
man
to
realise
it
in
some
idea
of
permanence
the
highest
reality
has
actively
to
be
achieved
the
gain
of
truth
is
not
in
the
end
it
reveals
itself
through
the
endless
length
of
achievement
but
what
is
there
to
guide
us
in
our
voyage
of
realisation
men
have
ever
been
struggling
for
direction
therefore
the
names
of
demon
ghost
and
heaven
remain
the
records
of
their
vain
endeavour
frail
spells
uttered
charm
might
not
avail
to
sever
from
all
we
hear
and
all
we
see
doubt
chance
and
mutability
the
prevalent
rites
and
practices
of
piety
according
to
this
poet
are
like
magic
only
prove
men
desperate
endeavour
and
not
their
success
he
knows
that
the
end
we
seek
has
its
own
direct
call
to
us
its
own
light
to
guide
us
to
itself
and
truth
call
is
the
call
of
beauty
of
this
he
says
thy
light
alone
mist
mountain
driven
or
music
by
the
night
wind
sent
thro
strings
of
some
still
instrument
or
moonlight
on
a
midnight
stream
gives
grace
and
truth
to
life
unquiet
dream
about
this
revelation
of
truth
which
calls
us
on
and
yet
which
is
everywhere
a
village
singer
of
bengal
sings
my
master
flute
sounds
in
everything
drawing
me
out
of
my
house
to
everywhere
while
i
listen
to
it
i
know
that
every
step
i
take
is
in
my
master
house
for
he
is
the
sea
he
is
the
river
that
leads
to
the
sea
and
he
is
the
landing
place
religion
in
shelley
grew
with
his
life
it
was
not
given
to
him
in
fixed
and
doctrines
he
rebelled
against
them
he
had
the
creative
mind
which
could
only
approach
truth
through
its
joy
in
creative
effort
for
true
creation
is
realisation
of
truth
through
the
translation
of
it
into
our
own
symbols
v
for
man
the
best
opportunity
for
such
a
realisation
has
been
in
society
it
is
a
collective
creation
of
his
through
which
his
social
being
tries
to
find
itself
in
its
truth
and
beauty
had
that
society
merely
manifested
its
usefulness
it
would
be
inarticulate
like
a
dark
star
but
unless
it
degenerates
it
ever
suggests
in
its
concerted
movements
a
living
truth
as
its
soul
which
has
personality
in
this
large
life
of
social
communion
man
feels
the
mystery
of
unity
as
he
does
in
music
from
the
sense
of
that
unity
men
came
to
the
sense
of
their
god
and
therefore
every
religion
began
with
its
tribal
god
the
one
question
before
all
others
that
has
to
be
answered
by
our
civilisations
is
not
what
they
have
and
in
what
quantity
but
what
they
express
and
how
in
a
society
the
production
and
circulation
of
materials
the
amassing
and
spending
of
money
may
go
on
as
in
the
interminable
prolonging
of
a
straight
line
if
its
people
forget
to
follow
some
spiritual
design
of
life
which
curbs
them
and
transforms
them
into
an
organic
whole
for
growth
is
not
that
enlargement
which
is
merely
adding
to
the
dimensions
of
incompleteness
growth
is
the
movement
of
a
whole
towards
a
yet
fuller
wholeness
living
things
start
with
this
wholeness
from
the
beginning
of
their
career
a
child
has
its
own
perfection
as
a
child
it
would
be
ugly
if
it
appeared
as
an
unfinished
man
life
is
a
continual
process
of
synthesis
and
not
of
additions
our
activities
of
production
and
enjoyment
of
wealth
attain
that
spirit
of
wholeness
when
they
are
blended
with
a
creative
ideal
otherwise
they
have
the
insane
aspect
of
the
eternally
unfinished
they
become
like
locomotive
engines
which
have
railway
lines
but
no
stations
which
rush
on
towards
a
collision
of
uncontrolled
forces
or
to
a
sudden
breakdown
of
the
overstrained
machinery
through
creation
man
expresses
his
truth
through
that
expression
he
gains
back
his
truth
in
its
fulness
human
society
is
for
the
best
expression
of
man
and
that
expression
according
to
its
perfection
leads
him
to
the
full
realisation
of
the
divine
in
humanity
when
that
expression
is
obscure
then
his
faith
in
the
infinite
that
is
within
him
becomes
weak
then
his
aspiration
can
not
go
beyond
the
idea
of
success
his
faith
in
the
infinite
is
creative
his
desire
for
success
is
constructive
one
is
his
home
and
the
other
is
his
office
with
the
overwhelming
growth
of
necessity
civilisation
becomes
a
gigantic
office
to
which
the
home
is
a
mere
appendix
the
predominance
of
the
pursuit
of
success
gives
to
society
the
character
of
what
we
call
in
india
in
fighting
a
battle
the
the
noble
knight
followed
his
honour
for
his
ideal
which
was
greater
than
victory
itself
but
the
mercenary
has
success
for
his
object
the
name
shudra
symbolises
a
man
who
has
no
margin
round
him
beyond
his
bare
utility
the
word
denotes
a
classification
which
includes
all
naked
machines
that
have
lost
their
completeness
of
humanity
be
their
work
manual
or
intellectual
they
are
like
walking
stomachs
or
brains
and
we
feel
in
pity
urged
to
call
on
god
and
cry
cover
them
up
for
mercy
sake
with
some
veil
of
beauty
and
life
when
shelley
in
his
view
of
the
world
realised
the
spirit
of
beauty
which
is
the
vision
of
the
infinite
he
thus
uttered
his
faith
never
joy
illumed
my
brow
unlinked
with
hope
that
thou
wouldst
free
this
world
from
its
dark
slavery
that
thou
awful
loveliness
wouldst
give
these
words
can
not
express
this
was
his
faith
in
the
infinite
it
led
his
aspiration
towards
the
region
of
freedom
and
perfection
which
was
beyond
the
immediate
and
above
the
successful
this
faith
in
god
this
faith
in
the
reality
of
the
ideal
of
perfection
has
built
up
all
that
is
great
in
the
human
world
to
keep
indefinitely
walking
on
along
a
zigzag
course
of
change
is
negative
and
barren
a
mere
procession
of
notes
does
not
make
music
it
is
only
when
we
have
in
the
heart
of
the
march
of
sounds
some
musical
idea
that
it
creates
song
our
faith
in
the
infinite
reality
of
perfection
is
that
musical
idea
and
there
is
that
one
great
creative
force
in
our
civilisation
when
it
wakens
not
then
our
faith
in
money
in
material
power
takes
its
place
it
fights
and
destroys
and
in
a
brilliant
fireworks
of
suddenly
exhausts
itself
and
dies
in
ashes
and
smoke
vi
men
of
great
faith
have
always
called
us
to
wake
up
to
great
expectations
and
the
prudent
have
always
laughed
at
them
and
said
that
these
did
not
belong
to
reality
but
the
poet
in
man
knows
that
reality
is
a
creation
and
human
reality
has
to
be
called
forth
from
its
obscure
depth
by
man
faith
which
is
creative
there
was
a
day
when
the
human
reality
was
the
brutal
reality
that
was
the
only
capital
we
had
with
which
to
begin
our
career
but
age
after
age
there
has
come
to
us
the
call
of
faith
which
said
against
all
the
evidence
of
fact
you
are
more
than
you
appear
to
be
more
than
your
circumstances
seem
to
warrant
you
are
to
attain
the
impossible
you
are
immortal
the
unbelievers
had
laughed
and
tried
to
kill
the
faith
but
faith
grew
stronger
with
the
strength
of
martyrdom
and
at
her
bidding
higher
realities
have
been
created
over
the
strata
of
the
lower
has
not
a
new
age
come
borne
by
ushered
in
by
a
universal
agony
of
suffering
are
we
not
waiting
for
a
great
call
of
faith
which
will
say
to
us
come
out
of
your
present
limitations
you
are
to
attain
the
impossible
you
are
immortal
the
nations
who
are
not
prepared
to
accept
it
who
have
all
their
trust
in
their
present
machines
of
system
and
have
no
thought
or
space
to
spare
to
welcome
the
sudden
guest
who
comes
as
the
messenger
of
emancipation
are
bound
to
court
defeat
whatever
may
be
their
present
wealth
and
power
this
great
world
where
it
is
a
creation
an
expression
of
the
its
morning
sings
of
joy
to
the
newly
awakened
life
and
its
evening
stars
sing
to
the
traveller
weary
and
worn
of
the
triumph
of
life
in
a
new
birth
across
death
its
call
for
us
the
call
has
ever
roused
the
creator
in
man
and
urged
him
to
reveal
the
truth
to
reveal
the
infinite
in
himself
it
is
ever
claiming
from
us
in
our
own
creations
with
god
reminding
us
of
our
divine
nature
which
finds
itself
in
freedom
of
spirit
our
society
exists
to
remind
us
through
its
various
voices
that
the
ultimate
truth
in
man
is
not
in
his
intellect
or
his
possessions
it
is
in
his
illumination
of
mind
in
his
extension
of
sympathy
across
all
barriers
of
caste
and
colour
in
his
recognition
of
the
world
not
merely
as
a
storehouse
of
power
but
as
a
habitation
of
man
spirit
with
its
eternal
music
of
beauty
and
its
inner
light
of
the
divine
presence
the
creative
ideal
in
an
old
sanskrit
book
there
is
a
verse
which
describes
the
essential
elements
of
a
picture
the
first
in
order
is
separateness
of
forms
forms
are
many
forms
are
different
each
of
them
having
its
limits
but
if
this
were
absolute
if
all
forms
remained
obstinately
separate
then
there
would
be
a
fearful
loneliness
of
multitude
but
the
varied
forms
in
their
very
separateness
must
carry
something
which
indicates
the
paradox
of
their
ultimate
unity
otherwise
there
would
be
no
creation
so
in
the
same
verse
after
the
enumeration
of
separateness
comes
that
of
proportions
indicate
relationship
the
principle
of
mutual
accommodation
a
leg
dismembered
from
the
body
has
the
fullest
licence
to
make
a
caricature
of
itself
but
as
a
member
of
the
body
it
has
its
responsibility
to
the
living
unity
which
rules
the
body
it
must
behave
properly
it
must
keep
its
proportion
if
by
some
monstrous
chance
of
physiological
profiteering
it
could
outgrow
by
yards
its
then
we
know
what
a
picture
it
would
offer
to
the
spectator
and
what
embarrassment
to
the
body
itself
any
attempt
to
overcome
the
law
of
proportion
altogether
and
to
assert
absolute
separateness
is
rebellion
it
means
either
running
the
gauntlet
of
the
rest
or
remaining
segregated
the
same
sanskrit
word
which
in
a
book
of
æsthetics
means
proportions
in
a
book
of
logic
means
the
proofs
by
which
the
truth
of
a
proposition
is
ascertained
all
proofs
of
truth
are
credentials
of
relationship
individual
facts
have
to
produce
such
passports
to
show
that
they
are
not
expatriated
that
they
are
not
a
break
in
the
unity
of
the
whole
the
logical
relationship
present
in
an
intellectual
proposition
and
the
æsthetic
relationship
indicated
in
the
proportions
of
a
work
of
art
both
agree
in
one
thing
they
affirm
that
truth
consists
not
in
facts
but
in
harmony
of
facts
of
this
fundamental
note
of
reality
it
is
that
the
poet
has
said
beauty
is
truth
truth
beauty
proportions
which
prove
relativity
form
the
outward
language
of
creative
ideals
a
crowd
of
men
is
desultory
but
in
a
march
of
soldiers
every
man
keeps
his
proportion
of
time
and
space
and
relative
movement
which
makes
him
one
with
the
whole
vast
army
but
this
is
not
all
the
creation
of
an
army
has
for
its
inner
principle
one
single
idea
of
the
general
according
to
the
nature
of
that
ruling
idea
a
production
is
either
a
work
of
art
or
a
mere
construction
all
the
materials
and
regulations
of
a
company
have
the
unity
of
an
inner
motive
but
the
expression
of
this
unity
itself
is
not
the
end
it
ever
indicates
an
ulterior
purpose
on
the
other
hand
the
revelation
of
a
work
of
art
is
a
fulfilment
in
itself
the
consciousness
of
personality
which
is
the
consciousness
of
unity
in
ourselves
becomes
prominently
distinct
when
coloured
by
joy
or
sorrow
or
some
other
emotion
it
is
like
the
sky
which
is
visible
because
it
is
blue
and
which
takes
different
aspect
with
the
change
of
colours
in
the
creation
of
art
therefore
the
energy
of
an
emotional
ideal
is
necessary
as
its
unity
is
not
like
that
of
a
crystal
passive
and
inert
but
actively
expressive
take
for
example
the
following
verse
oh
fly
not
pleasure
pleasure
fold
me
thy
wings
i
prithee
yet
and
stay
for
my
heart
no
measure
knows
nor
other
treasure
to
buy
a
garland
for
my
love
and
thou
too
sorrow
sorrow
thou
mourner
fly
not
yet
away
for
i
fain
would
borrow
thy
sad
weeds
to
make
a
mourning
for
love
yesterday
the
words
in
this
quotation
merely
showing
the
metre
would
have
no
appeal
to
us
with
all
its
perfection
and
its
proportion
rhyme
and
cadence
it
would
only
be
a
construction
but
when
it
is
the
outer
body
of
an
inner
idea
it
assumes
a
personality
the
idea
flows
through
the
rhythm
permeates
the
words
and
throbs
in
their
rise
and
fall
on
the
other
hand
the
mere
idea
of
the
poem
stated
in
unrhythmic
prose
would
represent
only
a
fact
inertly
static
which
would
not
bear
repetition
but
the
emotional
idea
incarnated
in
a
rhythmic
form
acquires
the
dynamic
quality
needed
for
those
things
which
take
part
in
the
world
eternal
pageantry
take
the
following
doggerel
thirty
days
hath
september
april
june
and
november
the
metre
is
there
and
it
simulates
the
movement
of
life
but
it
finds
no
synchronous
response
in
the
metre
of
our
it
has
not
in
its
centre
the
living
idea
which
creates
for
itself
an
indivisible
unity
it
is
like
a
bag
which
is
convenient
and
not
like
a
body
which
is
inevitable
this
truth
implicit
in
our
own
works
of
art
gives
us
the
clue
to
the
mystery
of
creation
we
find
that
the
endless
rhythms
of
the
world
are
not
merely
constructive
they
strike
our
own
and
produce
music
therefore
it
is
we
feel
that
this
world
is
a
creation
that
in
its
centre
there
is
a
living
idea
which
reveals
itself
in
an
eternal
symphony
played
on
innumerable
instruments
all
keeping
perfect
time
we
know
that
this
great
that
runs
from
sky
to
sky
is
not
made
for
the
mere
enumeration
of
is
not
thirty
days
hath
september
has
its
direct
revelation
in
our
delight
that
delight
gives
us
the
key
to
the
truth
of
existence
it
is
personality
acting
upon
personalities
through
incessant
manifestations
the
solicitor
does
not
sing
to
his
client
but
the
bridegroom
sings
to
his
bride
and
when
our
soul
is
stirred
by
the
song
we
know
it
claims
no
fees
from
us
but
it
brings
the
tribute
of
love
and
a
call
from
the
bridegroom
it
may
be
said
that
in
pictorial
and
other
arts
there
are
some
designs
that
are
purely
decorative
and
apparently
have
no
living
and
inner
ideal
to
express
but
this
can
not
be
true
these
decorations
carry
the
emotional
motive
of
the
artist
which
says
i
find
joy
in
my
creation
it
is
good
all
the
language
of
joy
is
beauty
it
is
necessary
to
note
however
that
joy
is
not
pleasure
and
beauty
not
mere
prettiness
joy
is
the
outcome
of
detachment
from
self
and
lives
in
freedom
of
spirit
beauty
is
that
profound
expression
of
reality
which
satisfies
our
hearts
without
any
other
allurements
but
its
own
ultimate
value
when
in
some
pure
moments
of
ecstasy
we
realise
this
in
the
world
around
us
we
see
the
world
not
as
merely
existing
but
as
decorated
in
its
forms
sounds
colours
and
lines
we
feel
in
our
hearts
that
there
is
one
who
through
all
things
proclaims
i
have
joy
in
my
creation
that
is
why
the
sanskrit
verse
has
given
us
for
the
essential
elements
of
a
picture
not
only
the
manifoldness
of
forms
and
the
unity
of
their
proportions
but
also
the
emotional
idea
it
is
needless
to
say
that
upon
a
mere
expression
of
the
best
expression
of
criterion
of
art
can
rest
the
following
poem
is
described
by
the
poet
as
an
earnest
suit
to
his
unkind
mistress
and
wilt
thou
leave
me
thus
say
nay
say
nay
for
shame
to
save
thee
from
the
blame
of
all
my
grief
and
grame
and
wilt
thou
leave
me
thus
say
nay
say
nay
i
am
sure
the
poet
would
not
be
offended
if
i
expressed
my
doubts
about
the
earnestness
of
his
appeal
or
the
truth
of
his
avowed
necessity
he
is
responsible
for
the
lyric
and
not
for
the
sentiment
which
is
mere
material
the
fire
assumes
different
colours
according
to
the
fuel
used
but
we
do
not
discuss
the
fuel
only
the
flames
a
lyric
is
indefinably
more
than
the
sentiment
expressed
in
it
as
a
rose
is
more
than
its
substance
let
us
take
a
poem
in
which
the
earnestness
of
sentiment
is
truer
and
deeper
than
the
one
i
have
quoted
above
the
sun
closing
his
benediction
sinks
and
the
darkening
air
thrills
with
the
sense
of
the
triumphing
night
night
with
her
train
of
stars
and
her
great
gift
of
sleep
so
be
my
passing
my
task
accomplished
and
the
long
day
done
my
wages
taken
and
in
my
heart
some
late
lark
singing
let
me
be
gathered
to
the
quiet
west
the
sundown
splendid
and
serene
death
the
sentiment
expressed
in
this
poem
is
a
subject
for
a
psychologist
but
for
a
poem
the
subject
is
completely
merged
in
its
poetry
like
carbon
in
a
living
plant
which
the
lover
of
plants
ignores
leaving
it
for
a
to
seek
this
is
why
when
some
storm
of
feeling
sweeps
across
the
country
art
is
under
a
disadvantage
in
such
an
atmosphere
the
boisterous
passion
breaks
through
the
cordon
of
harmony
and
thrusts
itself
forward
as
the
subject
which
with
its
bulk
and
pressure
dethrones
the
unity
of
creation
for
a
similar
reason
most
of
the
hymns
used
in
churches
suffer
from
lack
of
poetry
for
in
them
the
deliberate
subject
assuming
the
first
importance
benumbs
or
kills
the
poem
most
patriotic
poems
have
the
same
deficiency
they
are
like
hill
streams
born
of
sudden
showers
which
are
more
proud
of
their
rocky
beds
than
of
their
water
currents
in
them
the
athletic
and
arrogant
subject
takes
it
for
granted
that
the
poem
is
there
to
give
it
occasion
to
display
its
powers
the
subject
is
the
material
wealth
for
the
sake
of
which
poetry
should
never
be
tempted
to
barter
her
soul
even
though
the
temptation
should
come
in
the
name
and
shape
of
public
good
or
some
usefulness
between
the
artist
and
his
art
must
be
that
perfect
detachment
which
is
the
pure
medium
of
love
he
must
never
make
use
of
this
love
except
for
its
own
perfect
expression
in
everyday
life
our
personality
moves
in
a
narrow
circle
of
immediate
and
therefore
our
feelings
and
events
within
that
short
range
become
prominent
subjects
for
ourselves
in
their
vehement
they
ignore
their
unity
with
the
all
they
rise
up
like
obstructions
and
obscure
their
own
background
but
art
gives
our
personality
the
disinterested
freedom
of
the
eternal
there
to
find
it
in
its
true
perspective
to
see
our
own
home
in
flames
is
not
to
see
fire
in
its
verity
but
the
fire
in
the
stars
is
the
fire
in
the
heart
of
the
infinite
there
it
is
the
script
of
creation
matthew
arnold
in
his
poem
addressed
to
a
nightingale
sings
hark
ah
the
the
hark
from
that
moonlit
cedar
what
a
burst
what
triumph
hark
pain
but
pain
when
met
within
the
boundaries
of
limited
reality
repels
and
hurts
it
is
discordant
with
the
narrow
scope
of
life
but
the
pain
of
some
great
martyrdom
has
the
detachment
of
eternity
it
appears
in
all
its
majesty
harmonious
in
the
context
of
everlasting
life
like
the
in
the
stormy
sky
not
on
the
laboratory
wire
pain
on
that
scale
has
its
harmony
in
great
love
for
by
hurting
love
it
reveals
the
infinity
of
love
in
all
its
truth
and
beauty
on
the
other
hand
the
pain
involved
in
business
insolvency
is
discordant
it
kills
and
consumes
till
nothing
remains
but
ashes
the
poet
sings
again
how
thick
the
bursts
come
crowding
through
the
leaves
eternal
passion
eternal
pain
and
the
truth
of
pain
in
eternity
has
been
sung
by
those
vedic
poets
who
had
said
from
joy
has
come
forth
all
creation
they
say
sa
tapas
tapatvá
sarvam
asrajata
yadidam
kincha
god
from
the
heat
of
his
pain
created
all
that
there
is
the
sacrifice
which
is
in
the
heart
of
creation
is
both
joy
and
pain
at
the
same
moment
of
this
sings
a
village
mystic
in
bengal
my
eyes
drown
in
the
darkness
of
joy
my
heart
like
a
lotus
closes
its
petals
in
the
rapture
of
the
dark
night
that
song
speaks
of
a
joy
which
is
deep
like
the
blue
sea
endless
like
the
blue
sky
which
has
the
magnificence
of
the
night
and
in
its
limitless
darkness
enfolds
the
radiant
worlds
in
the
awfulness
of
peace
it
is
the
unfathomed
joy
in
which
all
sufferings
are
made
one
a
poet
of
mediæval
india
tells
us
about
his
source
of
inspiration
in
a
poem
containing
a
question
and
an
answer
where
were
your
songs
my
bird
when
you
spent
your
nights
in
the
nest
was
not
all
your
pleasure
stored
therein
what
makes
you
lose
your
heart
to
the
sky
the
sky
that
is
limitless
the
bird
answers
i
had
my
pleasure
while
i
rested
within
bounds
when
i
soared
into
the
limitless
i
found
my
songs
to
detach
the
individual
idea
from
its
confinement
of
everyday
facts
and
to
give
its
soaring
wings
the
freedom
of
the
universal
this
is
the
function
of
poetry
the
ambition
of
macbeth
the
jealousy
of
othello
would
be
at
best
sensational
in
police
court
proceedings
but
in
shakespeare
dramas
they
are
carried
among
the
flaming
constellations
where
creation
throbs
with
eternal
passion
eternal
pain
the
religion
of
the
forest
i
we
stand
before
this
great
world
the
truth
of
our
life
depends
upon
our
attitude
of
mind
towards
attitude
which
is
formed
by
our
habit
of
dealing
with
it
according
to
the
special
circumstance
of
our
surroundings
and
our
temperaments
it
guides
our
attempts
to
establish
relations
with
the
universe
either
by
conquest
or
by
union
either
through
the
cultivation
of
power
or
through
that
of
sympathy
and
thus
in
our
realisation
of
the
truth
of
existence
we
put
our
emphasis
either
upon
the
principle
of
dualism
or
upon
the
principle
of
unity
the
indian
sages
have
held
in
the
upanishads
that
the
emancipation
of
our
soul
lies
in
its
realising
the
ultimate
truth
of
unity
they
said

know
all
that
moves
in
this
moving
world
as
enveloped
by
god
and
find
enjoyment
through
renunciation
not
through
greed
of
possession
the
meaning
of
this
is
that
when
we
know
the
multiplicity
of
things
as
the
final
truth
we
try
to
augment
ourselves
by
the
external
possession
of
them
but
when
we
know
the
infinite
soul
as
the
final
truth
then
through
our
union
with
it
we
realise
the
joy
of
our
soul
therefore
it
has
been
said
of
those
who
have
attained
their
fulfilment
sarvam
evá
vishanti
they
enter
into
all
things
their
perfect
relation
with
this
world
is
the
relation
of
union
this
ideal
of
perfection
preached
by
the
of
ancient
india
runs
through
the
heart
of
our
classical
literature
and
still
dominates
our
mind
the
legends
related
in
our
epics
cluster
under
the
forest
shade
bearing
all
through
their
narrative
the
message
of
the
our
two
greatest
classical
dramas
find
their
background
in
scenes
of
the
forest
hermitage
which
are
permeated
by
the
association
of
these
sages
the
history
of
the
northmen
of
europe
is
resonant
with
the
music
of
the
sea
that
sea
is
not
merely
topographical
in
its
significance
but
represents
certain
ideals
of
life
which
still
guide
the
history
and
inspire
the
creations
of
that
race
in
the
sea
nature
presented
herself
to
those
men
in
her
aspect
of
a
danger
a
barrier
which
seemed
to
be
at
constant
war
with
the
land
and
its
children
the
sea
was
the
challenge
of
untamed
nature
to
the
indomitable
human
soul
and
man
did
not
flinch
he
fought
and
won
and
the
spirit
of
fight
continued
in
him
this
fight
he
still
maintains
it
is
the
fight
against
disease
and
poverty
tyranny
of
matter
and
of
man
this
refers
to
a
people
who
live
by
the
sea
and
ride
on
it
as
on
a
wild
champing
horse
catching
it
by
its
mane
and
making
it
render
service
from
shore
to
shore
they
find
delight
in
turning
by
force
the
antagonism
of
circumstances
into
obedience
truth
appears
to
them
in
her
aspect
of
dualism
the
perpetual
conflict
of
good
and
evil
which
has
no
reconciliation
which
can
only
end
in
victory
or
defeat
but
in
the
level
tracts
of
northern
india
men
found
no
barrier
between
their
lives
and
the
grand
life
that
permeates
the
universe
the
forest
entered
into
a
close
living
relationship
with
their
work
and
leisure
with
their
daily
necessities
and
contemplations
they
could
not
think
of
other
surroundings
as
separate
or
inimical
so
the
view
of
the
truth
which
these
men
found
did
not
make
manifest
the
difference
but
rather
the
unity
of
all
things
they
uttered
their
faith
in
these
words
yadidam
kinch
sarvam
prâna
éjati
nihsratam
all
that
is
vibrates
with
life
having
come
out
from
life
when
we
know
this
world
as
alien
to
us
then
its
mechanical
aspect
takes
prominence
in
our
mind
and
then
we
set
up
our
machines
and
our
methods
to
deal
with
it
and
make
as
much
profit
as
our
knowledge
of
its
mechanism
allows
us
to
do
this
view
of
things
does
not
play
us
false
for
the
machine
has
its
place
in
this
world
and
not
only
this
material
universe
but
human
beings
also
may
be
used
as
machines
and
made
to
yield
powerful
results
this
aspect
of
truth
can
not
be
ignored
it
has
to
be
known
and
mastered
europe
has
done
so
and
has
reaped
a
rich
harvest
the
view
of
this
world
which
india
has
taken
is
summed
up
in
one
compound
sanskrit
word
sachidānanda
the
meaning
is
that
reality
which
is
essentially
one
has
three
phases
the
first
is
sat
it
is
the
simple
fact
that
things
are
the
fact
which
relates
us
to
all
things
through
the
relationship
of
common
existence
the
second
is
chit
it
is
the
fact
that
we
know
which
relates
us
to
all
things
through
the
relationship
of
knowledge
the
third
is
ananda
it
is
the
fact
that
we
enjoy
which
unites
us
with
all
things
through
the
relationship
of
love
according
to
the
true
indian
view
our
consciousness
of
the
world
merely
as
the
sum
total
of
things
that
exist
and
as
governed
by
laws
is
imperfect
but
it
is
perfect
when
our
consciousness
realises
all
things
as
spiritually
one
with
it
and
therefore
capable
of
giving
us
joy
for
us
the
highest
purpose
of
this
world
is
not
merely
living
in
it
knowing
it
and
making
use
of
it
but
realising
our
own
selves
in
it
through
expansion
of
sympathy
not
alienating
ourselves
from
it
and
dominating
it
but
comprehending
and
uniting
it
with
ourselves
in
perfect
union
ii
when
vikramâditya
became
king
ujjayini
a
great
capital
and
kâlidâsa
its
poet
the
age
of
india
forest
retreats
had
passed
then
we
had
taken
our
stand
in
the
midst
of
the
great
concourse
of
humanity
the
chinese
and
the
hun
the
scythian
and
the
persian
the
greek
and
the
roman
had
crowded
round
us
but
even
in
that
age
of
pomp
and
prosperity
the
love
and
reverence
with
which
its
poet
sang
about
the
hermitage
shows
what
was
the
dominant
ideal
that
occupied
the
mind
of
india
what
was
the
one
current
of
memory
that
continually
flowed
through
her
life
in
kâlidâsa
drama
the
hermitage
which
dominates
the
play
overshadowing
the
king
palace
has
the
same
idea
running
through
recognition
of
the
kinship
of
man
with
conscious
and
unconscious
creation
alike
a
poet
of
a
later
age
while
describing
a
hermitage
in
his
kâdambari
tells
us
of
the
posture
of
salutation
in
the
flowering
lianas
as
they
bow
to
the
wind
of
the
sacrifice
offered
by
the
trees
scattering
their
blossoms
of
the
grove
resounding
with
the
lessons
chanted
by
the
neophytes
and
the
verses
repeated
by
the
parrots
learnt
by
constantly
hearing
them
of
the
enjoying
the
food
offered
to
the
divinity
which
is
in
all
creatures
of
the
ducks
coming
up
from
the
lake
for
their
portion
of
the
grass
seed
spread
in
the
cottage
yards
to
dry
and
of
the
deer
caressing
with
their
tongues
the
young
hermit
boys
it
is
again
the
same
story
the
hermitage
shines
out
in
all
our
ancient
literature
as
the
place
where
the
chasm
between
man
and
the
rest
of
creation
has
been
bridged
in
the
western
dramas
human
characters
drown
our
attention
in
the
vortex
of
their
passions
nature
occasionally
peeps
out
but
she
is
almost
always
a
trespasser
who
has
to
offer
excuses
or
bow
apologetically
and
depart
but
in
all
our
dramas
which
still
retain
their
fame
such
as
nature
stands
on
her
own
right
proving
that
she
has
her
great
function
to
impart
the
peace
of
the
eternal
to
human
emotions
the
fury
of
passion
in
two
of
shakespeare
youthful
poems
is
exhibited
in
conspicuous
isolation
it
is
snatched
away
naked
from
the
context
of
the
all
it
has
not
the
green
earth
or
the
blue
sky
around
it
it
is
there
ready
to
bring
to
our
view
the
raging
fever
which
is
in
man
desires
and
not
the
balm
of
health
and
repose
which
encircles
it
in
the
universe
is
clearly
a
work
of
kâlidâsa
immaturity
the
youthful
in
it
does
not
reach
the
sublime
reticence
which
is
in
and
but
the
tune
of
these
voluptuous
outbreaks
is
set
to
the
varied
harmony
of
nature
symphony
the
moonbeams
of
the
summer
evening
resonant
with
the
flow
of
fountains
acknowledge
it
as
a
part
of
its
own
melody
in
its
rhythm
sways
the
kadamba
forest
glistening
in
the
first
cool
rain
of
the
season
and
the
south
breezes
carrying
the
scent
of
the
mango
blossoms
temper
it
with
their
murmur
in
the
third
canto
of
madana
the
god
eros
enters
the
forest
sanctuary
to
set
free
a
sudden
flood
of
desire
amid
the
serenity
of
the
ascetics
meditation
but
the
boisterous
outbreak
of
passion
so
caused
was
shown
against
a
background
of
universal
life
the
divine
of
sati
and
shiva
found
their
response
in
the
immensity
of
youth
in
which
animals
and
trees
have
their
not
only
its
third
canto
but
the
whole
of
the
poem
is
painted
upon
a
limitless
canvas
it
tells
of
the
eternal
wedding
of
love
its
wooing
and
sacrifice
and
its
fulfilment
for
which
the
gods
wait
in
suspense
its
inner
idea
is
deep
and
of
all
time
it
answers
the
one
question
that
humanity
asks
through
all
its
endeavours
how
is
the
birth
of
the
hero
to
be
brought
about
the
brave
one
who
can
defy
and
vanquish
the
evil
demon
laying
waste
heaven
own
kingdom
it
becomes
evident
that
such
a
problem
had
become
acute
in
time
when
the
old
simplicity
of
hindu
life
had
broken
up
the
hindu
kings
forgetful
of
their
duties
had
become
epicureans
and
india
was
being
repeatedly
devastated
by
the
scythians
what
answer
then
does
the
poem
give
to
the
question
it
raises
its
message
is
that
the
cause
of
weakness
lies
in
the
inner
life
of
the
soul
it
is
in
some
break
of
harmony
with
the
good
some
dissociation
from
the
true
in
the
commencement
of
the
poem
we
find
that
the
god
shiva
the
good
had
remained
for
long
lost
in
the
solitude
of
his
asceticism
detached
from
the
world
of
reality
and
then
paradise
was
lost
but
is
the
poem
of
paradise
regained
how
was
it
regained
when
sati
the
spirit
of
reality
through
humiliation
suffering
and
penance
won
the
heart
of
shiva
the
spirit
of
goodness
and
thus
from
the
union
of
the
freedom
of
the
real
with
the
restraint
of
the
good
was
born
the
heroism
that
released
paradise
from
the
demon
of
lawlessness
viewed
from
without
india
in
the
time
of
kâlidâsa
appeared
to
have
reached
the
zenith
of
civilisation
excelling
as
she
did
in
luxury
literature
and
the
arts
but
from
the
poems
of
kâlidâsa
it
is
evident
that
this
very
magnificence
of
wealth
and
enjoyment
worked
against
the
ideal
that
sprang
and
flowed
forth
from
the
sacred
solitude
of
the
forest
these
poems
contain
the
voice
of
warnings
against
the
gorgeous
unreality
of
that
age
which
like
a
himalayan
avalanche
was
slowly
gliding
down
to
an
abyss
of
catastrophe
and
from
his
seat
beside
all
the
glories
of
vikramâditya
throne
the
poet
heart
yearns
for
the
purity
and
simplicity
of
india
past
age
of
spiritual
striving
and
it
was
this
yearning
which
impelled
him
to
go
back
to
the
annals
of
the
ancient
kings
of
raghu
line
for
the
narrative
poem
in
which
he
traced
the
history
of
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
ideal
that
should
guide
the
rulers
of
men
king
dilipa
with
queen
sudakshinâ
has
entered
upon
the
life
of
the
forest
the
great
monarch
is
busy
tending
the
cattle
of
the
hermitage
thus
the
poem
opens
amid
scenes
of
simplicity
and
but
it
ends
in
the
palace
of
magnificence
in
the
extravagance
of
with
a
calm
restraint
of
language
the
poet
tells
us
of
the
kingly
glory
crowned
with
purity
he
begins
his
poem
as
the
day
begins
in
the
serenity
of
sunrise
but
lavish
are
the
colours
in
which
he
describes
the
end
as
of
the
evening
eloquent
for
a
time
with
the
sumptuous
splendour
of
sunset
but
overtaken
at
last
by
the
devouring
darkness
which
sweeps
away
all
its
brilliance
into
night
in
this
beginning
and
this
ending
of
his
poem
there
lies
hidden
that
message
of
the
forest
which
found
its
voice
in
the
poet
words
there
runs
through
the
narrative
the
idea
that
the
future
glowed
gloriously
ahead
only
when
there
was
in
the
atmosphere
the
calm
of
of
purity
and
renunciation
when
downfall
had
become
imminent
the
hungry
fires
of
desire
aflame
at
a
hundred
different
points
dazzled
the
eyes
of
all
beholders
kâlidâsa
in
almost
all
his
works
represented
the
unbounded
impetuousness
of
kingly
splendour
on
the
one
side
and
the
serene
strength
of
regulated
desires
on
the
other
even
in
the
minor
drama
of
we
find
the
same
thing
in
a
different
manner
it
must
never
be
thought
that
in
this
play
the
poet
deliberate
object
was
to
pander
to
his
royal
patron
by
inviting
him
to
a
literary
orgy
of
lust
and
passion
the
very
introductory
verse
indicates
the
object
towards
which
this
play
is
directed
the
poet
begins
the
drama
with
the
prayer
sanmârgâlókayan
vyapanayatu
sa
nastâmasi
vritimishah
let
god
to
illumine
for
us
the
path
of
truth
sweep
away
our
passions
bred
of
darkness
this
is
the
god
shiva
in
whose
nature
parvati
the
eternal
woman
is
ever
commingled
in
an
ascetic
purity
of
love
the
unified
being
of
shiva
and
parvati
is
the
perfect
symbol
of
the
eternal
in
the
wedded
love
of
man
and
woman
when
the
poet
opens
his
drama
with
an
invocation
of
this
spirit
of
the
divine
union
it
is
evident
that
it
contains
in
it
the
message
with
which
he
greets
his
kingly
audience
the
whole
drama
goes
to
show
the
ugliness
of
the
treachery
and
cruelty
inherent
in
unchecked
in
the
play
the
conflict
of
ideals
is
between
the
king
and
the
queen
between
agnimitra
and
dhârini
and
the
significance
of
the
contrast
lies
hidden
in
the
very
names
of
the
hero
and
the
heroine
though
the
name
agnimitra
is
historical
yet
it
symbolises
in
the
poet
mind
the
destructive
force
of
uncontrolled
as
did
the
name
agnivarna
in
agnimitra
the
friend
of
the
fire
the
reckless
person
who
in
his
is
playing
with
fire
not
knowing
that
all
the
time
it
is
scorching
him
black
and
what
a
great
name
is
dhârini
signifying
the
fortitude
and
forbearance
that
comes
from
majesty
of
soul
what
an
association
it
carries
of
the
infinite
dignity
of
love
purified
by
a
that
rises
far
above
all
insult
and
baseness
of
betrayal
in
this
conflict
of
ideals
has
been
shown
all
through
the
drama
by
the
contrast
of
the
pompous
heartlessness
of
the
court
and
the
natural
purity
of
the
forest
hermitage
the
drama
opens
with
a
hunting
scene
where
the
king
is
in
pursuit
of
an
antelope
the
cruelty
of
the
chase
appears
like
a
menace
symbolising
the
spirit
of
the
king
life
clashing
against
the
spirit
of
the
forest
retreat
which
is
sharanyam
where
all
creatures
find
their
protection
of
love
and
the
pleading
of
the
with
the
king
to
spare
the
life
of
the
deer
helplessly
innocent
and
beautiful
is
the
pleading
that
rises
from
the
heart
of
the
whole
drama
never
oh
never
is
the
arrow
meant
to
pierce
the
tender
body
of
a
deer
even
as
the
fire
is
not
for
the
burning
of
flowers
in
the
râma
and
his
companions
in
their
banishment
had
to
traverse
forest
after
forest
they
had
to
live
in
huts
to
sleep
on
the
bare
ground
but
as
their
hearts
felt
their
kinship
with
woodland
hill
and
stream
they
were
not
in
exile
amidst
these
poets
brought
up
in
an
atmosphere
of
different
ideals
would
have
taken
this
opportunity
of
depicting
in
dismal
colours
the
hardship
of
the
in
order
to
bring
out
the
martyrdom
of
râmachandra
with
all
the
emphasis
of
a
strong
contrast
but
in
the
we
are
led
to
realise
the
greatness
of
the
hero
not
in
a
fierce
struggle
with
nature
but
in
sympathy
with
it
sitâ
the
of
a
great
kingly
house
goes
along
the
forest
paths
we
read
she
asks
râma
about
the
flowering
trees
and
shrubs
and
creepers
which
she
has
not
seen
before
at
her
request
lakshmana
gathers
and
brings
her
plants
of
all
kinds
exuberant
with
flowers
and
it
delights
her
heart
to
see
the
forest
rivers
variegated
with
their
streams
and
sandy
banks
resounding
with
the
call
of
heron
and
duck
when
râma
first
took
his
abode
in
the
chitrakuta
peak
that
delightful
chitrakuta
by
the
mâlyavati
river
with
its
easy
slopes
for
landing
he
forgot
all
the
pain
of
leaving
his
home
in
the
capital
at
the
sight
of
those
woodlands
alive
with
beast
and
bird
having
lived
on
that
hill
for
long
râma
who
was
lover
of
the
mountain
and
the
forest
said
one
day
to
sitâ
when
i
look
upon
the
beauties
of
this
hill
the
loss
of
my
kingdom
troubles
me
no
longer
nor
does
the
separation
from
my
friends
cause
me
any
pang
thus
passed
râmachandra
exile
now
in
woodland
now
in
hermitage
the
love
which
râma
and
sitâ
bore
to
each
other
united
them
not
only
to
each
other
but
to
the
universe
of
life
that
is
why
when
sitâ
was
taken
away
the
loss
seemed
to
be
so
great
to
the
forest
itself
iii
strangely
enough
in
shakespeare
dramas
like
those
of
kâlidâsa
we
find
a
secret
vein
of
complaint
against
the
artificial
life
of
the
king
life
of
ungrateful
treachery
and
falsehood
and
almost
everywhere
in
his
dramas
foreign
scenes
have
been
introduced
in
connection
with
some
working
of
the
life
of
unscrupulous
ambition
it
is
perfectly
obvious
in
of
there
nature
offers
no
message
or
balm
to
the
injured
soul
of
man
in
the
mountainous
forest
and
the
cave
appear
in
their
aspect
of
obstruction
to
life
opportunities
these
only
seem
tolerable
in
comparison
with
the
vicissitudes
of
fortune
in
the
artificial
court
life
in
you
like
the
forest
of
arden
is
didactic
in
its
lessons
it
does
not
bring
peace
but
preaches
when
it
says
hath
not
old
custom
made
this
life
more
sweet
than
that
of
painted
pomp
are
not
these
woods
more
free
from
peril
than
the
envious
court
in
the
through
prospero
treatment
of
ariel
and
caliban
we
realise
man
struggle
with
nature
and
his
longing
to
sever
connection
with
her
in
as
a
prelude
to
a
bloody
crime
of
treachery
and
treason
we
are
introduced
to
a
scene
of
barren
heath
where
the
three
witches
appear
as
personifications
of
nature
malignant
forces
and
in
it
is
the
fury
of
a
father
love
turned
into
curses
by
the
ingratitude
born
of
the
unnatural
life
of
the
court
that
finds
its
symbol
in
the
storm
on

needless
for
me
to
say
that
these
observations
are
not
intended
to
minimise
shakespeare
great
power
as
a
dramatic
poet
but
to
show
in
his
works
the
gulf
between
nature
and
human
nature
owing
to
the
tradition
of
his
race
and
time
it
can
not
be
said
that
beauty
of
nature
is
ignored
in
his
writings
only
he
fails
to
recognise
in
them
the
truth
of
the
of
human
life
with
the
cosmic
life
of
the
world
we
observe
a
completely
different
attitude
of
mind
in
the
later
english
poets
like
wordsworth
and
shelley
which
can
be
attributed
in
the
main
to
the
great
mental
change
in
europe
at
that
particular
period
through
the
influence
of
the
newly
discovered
philosophy
of
india
which
stirred
the
soul
of
germany
and
aroused
the
attention
of
other
western
countries
in
milton
the
very
dwelling
in
the
garden
of
to
afford
a
special
opportunity
for
bringing
out
the
true
greatness
of
man
relationship
with
nature
but
though
the
poet
has
described
to
us
the
beauties
of
the
garden
though
he
has
shown
to
us
the
animals
living
there
in
amity
and
peace
among
themselves
there
is
no
reality
of
kinship
between
them
and
man
they
were
created
for
man
enjoyment
man
was
their
lord
and
master
we
find
no
trace
of
the
love
between
the
first
man
and
woman
gradually
surpassing
themselves
and
overflowing
the
rest
of
creation
such
as
we
find
in
the
love
scenes
in
and
in
the
seclusion
of
the
bower
where
the
first
man
and
woman
rested
in
the
garden
of
bird
beast
insect
or
worm
durst
enter
none
such
was
their
awe
of
man
not
that
india
denied
the
superiority
of
man
but
the
test
of
that
superiority
lay
according
to
her
in
the
comprehensiveness
of
sympathy
not
in
the
aloofness
of
absolute
distinction
iv
india
holds
sacred
and
counts
as
places
of
pilgrimage
all
spots
which
display
a
special
beauty
or
splendour
of
nature
these
had
no
original
attraction
on
account
of
any
special
fitness
for
cultivation
or
settlement
here
man
is
free
not
to
look
upon
nature
as
a
source
of
supply
of
his
necessities
but
to
realise
his
soul
beyond
himself
the
himâlayas
of
india
are
sacred
and
the
vindhya
hills
her
majestic
rivers
are
sacred
lake
mânasa
and
the
confluence
of
the
ganges
and
the
jamuna
are
sacred
india
has
saturated
with
her
love
and
worship
the
great
nature
with
which
her
children
are
surrounded
whose
light
fills
their
eyes
with
gladness
and
whose
water
cleanses
them
whose
food
gives
them
life
and
from
whose
majestic
mystery
comes
forth
the
constant
revelation
of
the
infinite
in
music
scent
and
colour
which
brings
its
awakening
to
the
soul
of
man
india
gains
the
world
through
worship
through
spiritual
communion
and
the
idea
of
freedom
to
which
she
aspired
was
based
upon
the
realisation
of
her
spiritual
unity
when
in
my
recent
voyage
to
europe
our
ship
left
aden
and
sailed
along
the
sea
which
lay
between
the
two
continents
we
passed
by
the
red
and
barren
rocks
of
arabia
on
our
right
side
and
the
gleaming
sands
of
egypt
on
our
left
they
seemed
to
me
like
two
giant
brothers
exchanging
with
each
other
burning
glances
of
hatred
kept
apart
by
the
tearful
entreaty
of
the
sea
from
whose
womb
they
had
their
birth
there
was
an
immense
stretch
of
silence
on
the
left
shore
as
well
as
on
the
right
but
the
two
shores
spoke
to
me
of
the
two
different
historical
dramas
enacted
the
civilisation
which
found
its
growth
in
egypt
was
continued
across
long
centuries
elaborately
rich
with
sentiments
and
expressions
of
life
with
pictures
sculptures
temples
and
ceremonials
this
was
a
country
whose
was
a
noble
river
which
spread
the
festivities
of
life
on
its
banks
across
the
heart
of
the
land
there
man
never
raised
the
barrier
of
alienation
between
himself
and
the
rest
of
the
world
on
the
opposite
shore
of
the
red
sea
the
civilisation
which
grew
up
in
the
inhospitable
soil
of
arabia
had
a
contrary
character
to
that
of
egypt
there
man
felt
himself
isolated
in
his
hostile
and
bare
surroundings
his
idea
of
god
became
that
of
a
jealous
god
his
mind
naturally
dwelt
upon
the
principle
of
separateness
it
roused
in
him
the
spirit
of
fight
and
this
spirit
was
a
force
that
drove
him
far
and
wide
these
two
civilisations
represented
two
fundamental
divisions
of
human
nature
the
one
contained
in
it
the
spirit
of
conquest
and
the
other
the
spirit
of
harmony
and
both
of
these
have
their
truth
and
purpose
in
human
existence
the
characters
of
two
eminent
sages
have
been
described
in
our
mythology
one
was
vashishtha
and
another
vishvâmitra
both
of
them
were
great
but
they
represented
two
different
types
of
wisdom
and
there
was
conflict
between
them
vishvâmitra
sought
to
achieve
power
and
was
proud
of
it
vashishtha
was
rudely
smitten
by
that
power
but
his
hurt
and
his
loss
could
not
touch
the
illumination
of
his
soul
for
he
rose
above
them
and
could
forgive
râmachandra
the
great
hero
of
our
epic
had
his
initiation
to
the
spiritual
life
from
vashishtha
the
life
of
inner
peace
and
perfection
but
he
had
his
initiation
to
war
from
vishvâmitra
who
called
him
to
kill
the
demons
and
gave
him
weapons
that
were
irresistible
those
two
sages
symbolise
in
themselves
the
two
guiding
spirits
of
civilisation
can
it
be
true
that
they
shall
never
be
reconciled
if
so
can
ever
the
age
of
peace
and
dawn
upon
the
human
world
creation
is
the
harmony
of
contrary
forces
of
attraction
and
repulsion
when
they
join
hands
all
the
fire
and
fight
are
changed
into
the
smile
of
flowers
and
the
songs
of
birds
when
there
is
only
one
of
them
triumphant
and
the
other
defeated
then
either
there
is
the
death
of
cold
rigidity
or
that
of
suicidal
explosion
humanity
for
ages
has
been
busy
with
the
one
great
creation
of
spiritual
life
its
best
wisdom
its
discipline
its
literature
and
art
all
the
teachings
and
of
its
noblest
teachers
have
been
for
this
but
the
harmony
of
contrary
forces
which
give
their
rhythm
to
all
creation
has
not
yet
been
perfected
by
man
in
his
civilisation
and
the
creator
in
him
is
baffled
over
and
over
again
he
comes
back
to
his
work
however
and
makes
himself
busy
building
his
world
in
the
midst
of
desolation
and
ruins
his
history
is
the
history
of
his
aspiration
interrupted
and
renewed
and
one
truth
of
which
he
must
be
reminded
therefore
is
that
the
power
which
accomplishes
the
miracle
of
creation
by
bringing
conflicting
forces
into
the
harmony
of
the
one
is
no
passion
but
a
love
which
accepts
the
bonds
of
from
the
joy
of
its
own
love
whose
sacrifice
is
the
manifestation
of
its
endless
wealth
within
itself
an
indian
folk
religion
i
in
historical
time
the
buddha
comes
first
of
those
who
declared
salvation
to
all
men
without
distinction
as
by
right
man
own
what
was
the
special
force
which
startled
men
minds
and
almost
within
the
master
lifetime
spread
his
teachings
over
india
it
was
the
unique
significance
of
the
event
when
a
man
came
to
men
and
said
to
them
i
am
here
to
emancipate
you
from
the
miseries
of
the
thraldom
of
self
this
wisdom
came
neither
in
texts
of
scripture
nor
in
symbols
of
deities
nor
in
religious
practices
sanctified
by
ages
but
through
the
voice
of
a
living
man
and
the
love
that
flowed
from
a
human
heart
and
i
believe
this
was
the
first
occasion
in
the
history
of
the
world
when
the
idea
of
the
avatâr
found
its
place
in
religion
western
scholars
are
never
tired
of
insisting
that
buddhism
is
of
the
nature
of
a
moral
code
coldly
leading
to
the
path
of
extinction
they
forget
that
it
was
held
to
be
a
religion
that
roused
in
its
devotees
an
inextinguishable
fire
of
enthusiasm
and
carried
them
to
lifelong
exile
across
the
mountain
and
desert
barriers
to
say
that
a
philosophy
of
suicide
can
keep
kindled
in
human
hearts
for
centuries
such
fervour
of
is
to
go
against
all
the
laws
of
sane
psychology
the
religious
enthusiasm
which
can
not
be
bound
within
any
daily
ritual
but
overflows
into
adventures
of
love
and
beneficence
must
have
in
its
centre
that
element
of
personality
which
rouses
the
whole
soul
in
answer
it
may
possibly
be
said
that
this
was
due
to
the
personality
of
buddha
himself
but
that
also
is
not
quite
true
the
personality
which
stirs
the
human
heart
to
its
immense
depths
leading
it
to
impossible
deeds
of
heroism
must
in
that
process
itself
reveal
to
men
the
infinite
which
is
in
all
humanity
and
that
is
what
happened
in
buddhism
making
it
a
religion
in
the
complete
sense
of
the
word
like
the
religion
of
the
upanishads
buddhism
also
generated
two
divergent
currents
the
one
impersonal
preaching
the
abnegation
of
self
through
discipline
and
the
other
personal
preaching
the
cultivation
of
sympathy
for
all
creatures
and
devotion
to
the
infinite
truth
of
love
the
other
which
is
called
the
mahâyâna
had
its
origin
in
the
positive
element
contained
in
buddha
teachings
which
is
immeasurable
love
it
could
never
by
any
logic
find
its
reality
in
the
emptiness
of
the
truthless
abyss
and
the
object
of
buddha
meditation
and
his
teachings
was
to
free
humanity
from
sufferings
but
what
was
the
path
that
he
revealed
to
us
was
it
some
negative
way
of
evading
pain
and
seeking
security
against
it
on
the
contrary
his
path
was
the
path
of
utmost
sacrifice
of
love
the
meaning
of
such
sacrifice
is
to
reach
some
ultimate
truth
some
positive
ideal
which
in
its
greatness
can
accept
suffering
and
transmute
it
into
the
profound
peace
of
true
emancipation
from
suffering
which
is
the
inalienable
condition
of
the
limited
life
of
the
self
can
never
be
attained
by
fleeing
from
it
but
rather
by
changing
its
value
in
the
realm
of
truth
of
the
higher
life
of
love
we
have
learnt
that
by
calculations
made
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
gravitation
some
planets
were
discovered
exactly
in
the
place
where
they
should
be
such
a
law
of
gravitation
there
is
also
in
the
moral
world
and
when
we
find
men
minds
disturbed
as
they
were
by
the
preaching
of
the
buddha
we
can
be
sure
even
without
any
corroborative
evidence
that
there
must
have
been
some
great
luminous
body
of
attraction
positive
and
powerful
and
not
a
mere
unfathomable
vacancy
it
is
exactly
this
which
we
discover
in
the
heart
of
the
mahâyâna
system
and
we
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
the
truth
of
buddhism
is
there
the
oil
has
to
be
burnt
not
for
the
purpose
of
diminishing
it
but
for
the
purpose
of
giving
light
to
the
lamp
and
when
the
buddha
said
that
the
self
must
go
he
said
at
the
same
moment
that
love
must
be
realised
thus
originated
the
doctrine
of
the
the
infinite
wisdom
and
love
manifested
in
the
buddha
it
was
the
first
instance
as
i
have
said
when
men
felt
that
the
universal
and
the
eternal
spirit
was
revealed
in
a
human
individual
whom
they
had
known
and
touched
the
joy
was
too
great
for
them
since
the
very
idea
itself
came
to
them
as
a
freedom
from
the
sense
of
their
measureless
insignificance
it
was
the
first
time
i
repeat
when
the
individual
as
a
man
felt
in
himself
the
infinite
made
concrete
what
was
more
those
men
who
felt
the
love
welling
forth
from
the
heart
of
buddhism
as
one
with
the
current
of
the
eternal
love
itself
were
struck
with
the
idea
that
such
an
effluence
could
never
have
been
due
to
a
single
cataclysm
of
and
therefore
untrue
they
felt
instead
that
it
was
in
the
eternal
nature
of
truth
that
the
event
must
belong
to
a
series
of
manifestations
there
must
have
been
numberless
other
revelations
in
the
past
and
endless
others
to
follow
the
idea
grew
and
widened
until
men
began
to
feel
that
this
infinite
being
was
already
in
every
one
of
them
and
that
it
rested
with
themselves
to
remove
the
sensual
obstructions
and
reveal
him
in
their
own
lives
in
every
individual
there
was
they
realised
the
potentiality
of
is
to
say
the
infinite
made
manifest
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
the
great
fact
that
the
preaching
of
the
buddha
in
india
was
not
followed
by
stagnation
of
would
surely
have
happened
if
humanity
was
without
any
positive
goal
and
his
teaching
was
without
any
permanent
value
in
itself
on
the
contrary
we
find
the
arts
and
sciences
springing
up
in
its
wake
institutions
started
for
alleviating
the
misery
of
all
creatures
human
and
and
great
centres
of
education
founded
some
mighty
power
was
suddenly
roused
from
its
obscurity
which
worked
for
long
centuries
and
changed
the
history
of
man
in
a
large
part
of
the
world
and
that
power
came
into
its
full
activity
only
by
the
individual
being
made
conscious
of
his
infinite
worth
it
was
like
the
sudden
discovery
of
a
great
mine
of
living
wealth
during
the
period
of
buddhism
the
doctrine
of
deliverance
flourished
which
reached
all
mankind
and
released
man
inner
resources
from
neglect
and
even
we
see
in
our
own
country
human
nature
from
its
despised
corner
of
indignity
slowly
and
painfully
finding
its
way
to
assert
the
inborn
majesty
of
man
it
is
like
the
imprisoned
tree
finding
a
rift
in
the
wall
and
sending
out
its
eager
branches
into
freedom
to
prove
that
darkness
is
not
its
birthright
that
its
love
is
for
the
sunshine
in
the
time
of
the
buddha
the
individual
discovered
his
own
immensity
of
worth
first
by
witnessing
a
man
who
united
his
heart
in
sympathy
with
all
creatures
in
all
worlds
through
the
power
of
a
love
that
knew
no
bounds
and
then
by
learning
that
the
same
light
of
perfection
lay
confined
within
himself
behind
the
clouds
of
selfish
desire
and
that
the
the
heart
of
the
eternal
enlightenment
moment
claimed
its
unveiling
in
his
own
heart
nâgârjuna
speaks
of
this
another
of
whose
names
is
as
follows
one
who
understands
the
nature
of
the
sees
everything
with
a
loving
heart
for
love
is
the
essence
of
footnote
of
mahâyâna
by
t
suzuki
my
object
in
writing
this
paper
is
to
show
by
the
further
help
of
illustration
from
a
popular
religious
sect
of
bengal
that
the
religious
instinct
of
man
urges
him
towards
a
truth
by
which
he
can
transcend
the
finite
nature
of
the
individual
self
man
would
never
feel
the
indignity
of
his
limitations
if
these
were
inevitable
within
him
he
has
glimpses
of
the
infinite
which
give
him
assurance
that
this
truth
is
not
in
his
limitations
but
that
this
truth
can
be
attained
by
love
for
love
is
the
positive
quality
of
the
infinite
and
love
sacrifice
accordingly
does
not
lead
to
emptiness
but
to
fulfilment
to
the
heart
of
enlightenment
the
members
of
the
religious
sect
i
have
mentioned
call
themselves
baül
they
live
outside
social
recognition
and
their
very
obscurity
helps
them
in
their
seeking
from
a
direct
source
the
enlightenment
which
the
soul
longs
for
the
eternal
light
of
love
it
would
be
absurd
to
say
that
there
is
little
difference
between
buddhism
and
the
religion
of
these
simple
people
who
have
no
system
of
metaphysics
to
support
their
faith
but
my
object
in
bringing
close
together
these
two
religions
which
seem
to
belong
to
opposite
poles
is
to
point
out
the
fundamental
unity
in
them
both
of
them
believe
in
a
fulfilment
which
is
reached
by
love
emancipating
us
from
the
dominance
of
self
in
both
these
religions
we
find
man
yearning
to
attain
the
infinite
worth
of
his
individuality
not
through
any
conventional
valuation
of
society
but
through
his
perfect
relationship
with
truth
they
agree
in
holding
that
the
realisation
of
our
ultimate
object
is
waiting
for
us
in
ourselves
the
baül
likens
this
fulfilment
to
the
blossoming
of
a
bud
and
sings
make
way
o
bud
make
way
burst
open
thy
heart
and
make
way
the
opening
spirit
has
overtaken
thee
canst
thou
remain
a
bud
any
longer
ii
one
day
in
a
small
village
in
bengal
an
ascetic
woman
from
the
neighbourhood
came
to
see
me
she
had
the
name
given
to
her
by
the
village
people
the
meaning
of
which
is
the
woman
who
is
mad
about
all
things
she
fixed
her
eyes
upon
my
face
and
startled
me
with
the
question
when
are
you
coming
to
meet
me
underneath
the
trees
evidently
she
pitied
me
who
lived
according
to
her
prisoned
behind
walls
banished
away
from
the
great
of
the
all
where
she
had
her
dwelling
just
at
that
moment
my
gardener
came
with
his
basket
and
when
the
woman
understood
that
the
flowers
in
the
vase
on
my
table
were
going
to
be
thrown
away
to
make
place
for
the
fresh
ones
she
looked
pained
and
said
to
me
you
are
always
engaged
reading
and
writing
you
do
not
see
then
she
took
the
discarded
flowers
in
her
palms
kissed
them
and
touched
them
with
her
forehead
and
reverently
murmured
to
herself
beloved
of
my
heart
i
felt
that
this
woman
in
her
direct
vision
of
the
infinite
personality
in
the
heart
of
all
things
truly
represented
the
spirit
of
india
in
the
same
village
i
came
into
touch
with
some
baül
singers
i
had
known
them
by
their
names
occasionally
seen
them
singing
and
begging
in
the
street
and
so
passed
them
by
vaguely
classifying
them
in
my
mind
under
the
general
name
of
vairâgis
or
ascetics
the
time
came
when
i
had
occasion
to
meet
with
some
members
of
the
same
body
and
talk
to
them
about
spiritual
matters
the
first
baül
song
which
i
chanced
to
hear
with
any
attention
profoundly
stirred
my
mind
its
words
are
so
simple
that
it
makes
me
hesitate
to
render
them
in
a
foreign
tongue
and
set
them
forward
for
critical
observation
besides
the
best
part
of
a
song
is
missed
when
the
tune
is
absent
for
thereby
its
movement
and
its
colour
are
lost
and
it
becomes
like
a
butterfly
whose
wings
have
been
plucked
the
first
line
may
be
translated
thus
where
shall
i
meet
him
the
man
of
my
heart
this
phrase
the
man
of
my
heart
is
not
peculiar
to
this
song
but
is
usual
with
the
baül
sect
it
means
that
for
me
the
supreme
truth
of
all
existence
is
in
the
revelation
of
the
infinite
in
my
own
humanity
the
man
of
my
heart
to
the
baül
is
like
a
divine
instrument
perfectly
tuned
he
gives
expression
to
infinite
truth
in
the
music
of
life
and
the
longing
for
the
truth
which
is
in
us
which
we
have
not
yet
realised
breaks
out
in
the
following
baül
song
where
shall
i
meet
him
the
man
of
my
heart
he
is
lost
to
me
and
i
seek
him
wandering
from
land
to
land
i
am
listless
for
that
moonrise
of
beauty
which
is
to
light
my
life
which
i
long
to
see
in
the
fulness
of
vision
in
gladness
of
heart
the
name
of
the
poet
who
wrote
this
song
was
gagan
he
was
almost
illiterate
and
the
ideas
he
received
from
his
baül
teacher
found
no
distraction
from
the
of
the
modern
age
he
was
a
village
postman
earning
about
ten
shillings
a
month
and
he
died
before
he
had
completed
his
teens
the
sentiment
to
which
he
gave
such
intensity
of
expression
is
common
to
most
of
the
songs
of
his
sect
and
it
is
a
sect
almost
exclusively
confined
to
that
lower
floor
of
society
where
the
light
of
modern
education
hardly
finds
an
entrance
while
wealth
and
respectability
shun
its
utter
indigence
in
the
song
i
have
translated
above
the
longing
of
the
singer
to
realise
the
infinite
in
his
own
personality
is
expressed
this
has
to
be
done
daily
by
its
perfect
expression
in
life
in
love
for
the
personal
expression
of
life
in
its
perfection
is
love
just
as
the
personal
expression
of
truth
in
its
perfection
is
beauty
in
the
political
life
of
the
modern
age
the
idea
of
democracy
has
given
mankind
faith
in
the
individual
it
gives
each
man
trust
in
his
own
possibilities
and
pride
in
his
humanity
something
of
the
same
idea
we
find
has
been
working
in
the
popular
mind
of
india
with
regard
to
its
religious
consciousness
over
and
over
again
it
tries
to
assert
not
only
that
god
is
each
of
us
but
also
that
god
is
each
of
us
these
people
have
no
special
incarnations
in
their
simple
theology
because
they
know
that
god
is
special
to
each
individual
they
say
that
to
be
born
a
man
is
the
greatest
privilege
that
can
fall
to
a
creature
in
all
the
world
they
assert
that
gods
in
paradise
envy
human
beings
why
because
god
will
in
giving
his
love
finds
its
completeness
in
man
will
returning
that
love
therefore
humanity
is
a
necessary
factor
in
the
perfecting
of
the
divine
truth
the
infinite
for
its
comes
down
into
the
manifoldness
of
the
finite
and
the
finite
for
its
must
rise
into
the
unity
of
the
infinite
then
only
is
the
cycle
of
truth
complete
the
dignity
of
man
in
his
eternal
right
of
truth
finds
expression
in
the
following
song
composed
not
by
a
theologian
or
a
man
of
letters
but
by
one
who
belongs
to
that
ninety
per
cent
of
the
population
of
british
india
whose
education
has
been
far
less
than
elementary
in
fact
almost
below
zero
my
longing
is
to
meet
you
in
play
of
love
my
lover
but
this
longing
is
not
only
mine
but
also
yours
for
your
lips
can
have
their
smile
and
your
flute
its
music
only
in
your
delight
in
my
love
and
therefore
you
are
importunate
even
as
i
am
if
the
world
were
a
mere
expression
of
formative
forces
then
this
song
would
be
pathetic
in
its
presumption
but
why
is
there
beauty
at
all
in
beauty
whose
only
meaning
is
in
a
call
that
claims
disinterestedness
as
a
response
the
poet
proudly
says
your
flute
could
not
have
its
music
of
beauty
if
your
delight
were
not
in
my
love
your
power
is
there
i
am
not
equal
to
it
lies
even
in
me
to
make
you
smile
and
if
you
and
i
never
meet
then
this
play
of
love
remains
incomplete
if
this
were
not
true
then
it
would
be
an
utter
humiliation
to
exist
at
all
in
this
world
if
it
were
solely
business
to
seek
the
lover
and
to
keep
himself
passively
aloof
in
the
infinity
of
his
glory
or
actively
masterful
only
in
imposing
his
commands
upon
us
then
we
should
dare
to
defy
him
and
refuse
to
accept
the
everlasting
insult
latent
in
the
importunity
of
a
slave
and
this
is
what
the
baül
who
in
the
world
of
men
goes
about
singing
for
alms
from
door
to
door
with
his
instrument
and
long
robe
of
rags
on
his
back
i
stop
and
sit
here
on
the
road
do
not
ask
me
to
walk
farther
if
your
love
can
be
complete
without
mine
let
me
turn
back
from
seeing
you
i
have
been
travelling
to
seek
you
my
friend
for
long
yet
i
refuse
to
beg
a
sight
of
you
if
you
do
not
feel
my
need
i
am
blind
with
market
dust
and
midday
glare
and
so
wait
my
heart
lover
in
hopes
that
your
own
love
will
send
you
to
find
me
out
the
poet
is
fully
conscious
that
his
value
in
the
world
market
is
pitifully
small
that
he
is
neither
wealthy
nor
learned
yet
he
has
his
great
compensation
for
he
has
come
close
to
his
lover
heart
in
bengal
the
women
bathing
in
the
river
often
use
their
overturned
water
jars
to
keep
themselves
floating
when
they
swim
and
the
poet
uses
this
incident
for
his
simile
it
is
lucky
that
i
am
an
empty
vessel
for
when
you
swim
i
keep
floating
by
your
side
your
full
vessels
are
left
on
the
empty
shore
they
are
for
use
but
i
am
carried
to
the
river
in
your
arms
and
i
dance
to
the
rhythm
of
your
and
heaving
of
the
waves
the
great
distinguished
people
of
the
world
do
not
know
that
these
of
education
honour
and
in
the
pride
of
their
souls
look
down
upon
them
as
the
unfortunate
ones
who
are
left
on
the
shore
for
their
worldly
uses
but
whose
life
ever
misses
the
touch
of
the
lover
arms
the
feeling
that
man
is
not
a
mere
casual
visitor
at
the
of
the
world
but
the
invited
guest
whose
presence
is
needed
to
give
the
royal
banquet
its
sole
meaning
is
not
confined
to
any
particular
sect
in
india
let
me
quote
here
some
poems
from
a
mediæval
poet
of
western
works
are
nearly
forgotten
and
have
become
scarce
from
the
very
exquisiteness
of
their
excellence
in
the
following
poem
he
is
addressing
god
messenger
who
comes
to
us
in
the
morning
light
of
our
childhood
in
the
dusk
of
our
day
end
and
in
the
night
darkness
messenger
morning
brought
you
habited
in
gold
after
sunset
your
song
wore
a
tune
of
ascetic
grey
and
then
came
night
your
message
was
written
in
bright
letters
across
the
black
why
is
such
splendour
about
you
to
lure
the
heart
of
one
who
is
nothing
this
is
the
answer
of
the
messenger
great
is
the
festival
hall
where
you
are
to
be
the
only
guest
therefore
the
letter
to
you
is
written
from
sky
to
sky
and
i
the
proud
servant
bring
the
invitation
with
all
ceremony
and
thus
the
poet
knows
that
the
silent
rows
of
stars
carry
god
own
invitation
to
the
individual
soul
the
same
poet
sings
what
hast
thou
come
to
beg
from
the
beggar
o
king
of
kings
my
kingdom
is
poor
for
want
of
him
my
dear
one
and
i
wait
for
him
in
sorrow
how
long
will
you
keep
him
waiting
o
wretch
who
has
waited
for
you
for
ages
in
silence
and
stillness
open
your
gate
and
make
this
very
moment
fit
for
the
union
it
is
the
song
of
man
pride
in
the
value
given
to
him
by
supreme
love
and
realised
by
his
own
love
the
vaishnava
religion
which
has
become
the
popular
religion
of
india
carries
the
same
message
god
love
finding
its
finality
in
man
love
according
to
it
the
lover
man
is
the
complement
of
the
lover
god
in
the
internal
love
drama
of
existence
and
god
call
is
ever
wafted
in
man
heart
in
the
drawing
him
towards
the
union
this
idea
has
been
expressed
in
rich
elaboration
of
symbols
verging
upon
realism
but
for
these
baüls
this
idea
is
direct
and
simple
full
of
the
dignified
beauty
of
truth
which
shuns
all
tinsels
of
ornament
the
baül
poet
when
asked
why
he
had
no
sect
mark
on
his
forehead
answered
in
his
song
that
the
true
colour
decoration
appears
on
the
skin
of
the
fruit
when
its
inner
core
is
filled
with
ripe
sweet
juice
but
by
artificially
smearing
it
with
colour
from
outside
you
do
not
make
it
ripe
and
he
says
of
his
guru
his
teacher
that
he
is
puzzled
to
find
in
which
direction
he
must
make
salutation
for
his
teacher
is
not
one
but
many
who
moving
on
form
a
procession
of
wayfarers
baüls
have
no
temple
or
image
for
their
worship
and
this
utter
simplicity
is
needful
for
men
whose
one
subject
is
to
realise
the
innermost
nearness
of
god
the
baül
poet
expressly
says
that
if
we
try
to
approach
god
through
the
senses
we
miss
him
bring
him
not
into
your
house
as
the
guest
of
your
eyes
but
let
him
come
at
your
heart
invitation
opening
your
doors
to
that
which
is
seen
only
is
to
lose
it
yet
being
a
poet
he
also
knows
that
the
objects
of
sense
can
reveal
their
spiritual
meaning
only
when
they
are
not
seen
through
mere
physical
eyes
eyes
can
see
only
dust
and
earth
but
feel
it
with
your
heart
it
is
pure
joy
the
flowers
of
delight
blossom
on
all
sides
in
every
form
but
where
is
your
heart
thread
to
weave
them
in
a
garland
these
baüls
have
a
philosophy
which
they
call
the
philosophy
of
the
body
but
they
keep
its
secret
it
is
only
for
the
initiated
evidently
the
underlying
idea
is
that
the
individual
body
is
itself
the
temple
in
whose
inner
mystic
shrine
the
divine
appears
before
the
soul
and
the
key
to
it
has
to
be
found
from
those
who
know
but
as
the
key
is
not
for
us
outsiders
i
leave
it
with
the
observation
that
this
mystic
philosophy
of
the
body
is
the
outcome
of
the
attempt
to
get
rid
of
all
the
outward
shelters
which
are
too
costly
for
people
like
themselves
but
this
human
body
of
ours
is
made
by
god
own
hand
from
his
own
love
and
even
if
some
men
in
the
pride
of
their
superiority
may
despise
it
god
finds
his
joy
in
dwelling
in
others
of
yet
lower
birth
it
is
a
truth
easier
of
discovery
by
these
people
of
humble
origin
than
by
men
of
proud
estate
the
pride
of
the
baül
beggar
is
not
in
his
worldly
distinction
but
in
the
distinction
that
god
himself
has
given
to
him
he
feels
himself
like
a
flute
through
which
god
own
breath
of
love
has
been
breathed
my
heart
is
like
a
flute
he
has
played
on
if
ever
it
fall
into
other
hands
let
him
fling
it
away
my
lover
flute
is
dear
to
him
therefore
if
alien
breath
have
entered
it
and
sounded
strange
notes
let
him
break
it
to
pieces
and
strew
the
dust
with
them
so
we
find
that
this
man
also
has
his
disgust
of
defilement
while
the
ambitious
world
of
wealth
and
power
despises
him
he
in
his
turn
thinks
that
the
world
touch
desecrates
him
who
has
been
made
sacred
by
the
touch
of
his
lover
he
does
not
envy
us
our
life
of
ambition
and
achievements
but
he
knows
how
precious
his
own
life
has
been
i
am
poured
forth
in
living
notes
of
joy
and
sorrow
by
your
breath
morning
and
evening
in
summer
and
in
rains
i
am
fashioned
to
music
yet
should
i
be
wholly
spent
in
some
flight
of
song
i
shall
not
grieve
the
tune
is
so
precious
to
me
our
joys
and
sorrows
are
contradictory
when
self
separates
them
in
opposition
but
for
the
heart
in
which
self
merges
in
god
love
they
lose
their
absoluteness
so
the
baül
prayer
is
to
feel
in
all
danger
or
pain
or
he
is
in
god
hands
he
solves
the
problem
of
emancipation
from
sufferings
by
accepting
and
setting
them
in
a
higher
context
i
am
the
boat
you
are
the
sea
and
also
the
boatman
though
you
never
make
the
shore
though
you
let
me
sink
why
should
i
be
foolish
and
afraid
is
the
reaching
the
shore
a
greater
prize
than
losing
myself
with
you
if
you
are
only
the
haven
as
they
say
then
what
is
the
sea
let
it
surge
and
toss
me
on
its
waves
i
shall
be
content
i
live
in
you
whatever
and
however
you
appear
save
me
or
kill
me
as
you
wish
only
never
leave
me
in
others
hands
iii
it
is
needless
to
say
before
i
conclude
that
i
had
neither
the
training
nor
the
opportunity
to
study
this
mendicant
religious
sect
in
bengal
from
an
ethnological
standpoint
i
was
attracted
to
find
out
how
the
living
currents
of
religious
movements
work
in
the
heart
of
the
people
saving
them
from
degradation
imposed
by
the
society
of
the
learned
of
the
rich
or
of
the
how
the
spirit
of
man
by
making
use
even
of
its
obstacles
reaches
fulfilment
led
thither
not
by
the
learned
authorities
in
the
scriptures
or
by
the
mechanical
impulse
of
the
crowd
but
by
the
unsophisticated
aspiration
of
the
loving
soul
on
the
inaccessible
mountain
peaks
of
theology
the
snows
of
creed
remain
eternally
rigid
cold
and
pure
but
god
manifest
shower
falls
direct
on
the
plain
of
humble
hearts
flowing
there
in
various
channels
even
getting
mixed
with
some
mud
in
its
course
as
it
is
soaked
into
the
underground
currents
invisible
but
i
can
think
of
nothing
better
than
to
conclude
my
paper
with
a
poem
of
jnândâs
in
which
the
aspiration
of
all
simple
spirits
has
found
a
devout
expression
i
had
travelled
all
day
and
was
tired
then
i
bowed
my
head
towards
thy
kingly
court
still
far
away
the
night
deepened
a
longing
burned
in
my
heart
whatever
the
words
i
sang
pain
cried
through
even
my
songs
o
my
lover
my
beloved
my
best
in
all
the
world
when
time
seemed
lost
in
darkness
thy
hand
dropped
its
sceptre
to
take
up
the
lute
and
strike
the
uttermost
chords
and
my
heart
sang
out
o
my
lover
my
beloved
my
best
in
all
the
world
ah
who
is
this
whose
arms
enfold
me
whatever
i
have
to
leave
let
me
leave
and
whatever
i
have
to
bear
let
me
bear
only
let
me
walk
with
thee
o
my
lover
my
beloved
my
best
in
all
the
world
descend
at
whiles
from
thy
high
audience
hall
come
down
amid
joys
and
sorrows
hide
in
all
forms
and
delights
in
love
and
in
my
heart
sing
thy
songs
o
my
lover
my
beloved
my
best
in
all
the
world
east
and
west
i
it
is
not
always
a
profound
interest
in
man
that
carries
travellers
nowadays
to
distant
lands
more
often
it
is
the
facility
for
rapid
movement
for
lack
of
time
and
for
the
sake
of
convenience
we
generalise
and
crush
our
human
facts
into
the
packages
within
the
steel
trunks
that
hold
our
travellers
reports
our
knowledge
of
our
own
countrymen
and
our
feelings
about
them
have
slowly
and
unconsciously
grown
out
of
innumerable
facts
which
are
full
of
contradictions
and
subject
to
incessant
change
they
have
the
elusive
mystery
and
fluidity
of
life
we
can
not
define
to
ourselves
what
we
are
as
a
whole
because
we
know
too
much
because
our
knowledge
is
more
than
knowledge
it
is
an
immediate
consciousness
of
personality
any
evaluation
of
which
carries
some
emotion
joy
or
sorrow
shame
or
exaltation
but
in
a
foreign
land
we
try
to
find
our
compensation
for
the
meagreness
of
our
data
by
the
compactness
of
the
generalisation
which
our
imperfect
sympathy
itself
helps
us
to
form
when
a
stranger
from
the
west
travels
in
the
eastern
world
he
takes
the
facts
that
displease
him
and
readily
makes
use
of
them
for
his
rigid
conclusions
fixed
upon
the
unchallengeable
authority
of
his
personal
experience
it
is
like
a
man
who
has
his
own
boat
for
crossing
his
village
stream
but
on
being
compelled
to
wade
across
some
strange
watercourse
draws
angry
comparisons
as
he
goes
from
every
patch
of
mud
and
every
pebble
which
his
feet
encounter
our
mind
has
faculties
which
are
universal
but
its
habits
are
insular
there
are
men
who
become
impatient
and
angry
at
the
least
discomfort
when
their
habits
are
incommoded
in
their
idea
of
the
next
world
they
probably
conjure
up
the
ghosts
of
their
slippers
and
and
expect
the
latchkey
that
opens
their
door
on
earth
to
fit
their
front
door
in
the
other
world
as
travellers
they
are
a
failure
for
they
have
grown
too
accustomed
to
their
mental
and
in
their
intellectual
nature
love
home
comforts
which
are
of
local
make
more
than
the
realities
of
life
which
like
earth
itself
are
full
of
ups
and
downs
yet
are
one
in
their
rounded
completeness
the
modern
age
has
brought
the
geography
of
the
earth
near
to
us
but
made
it
difficult
for
us
to
come
into
touch
with
man
we
go
to
strange
lands
and
observe
we
do
not
live
there
we
hardly
meet
men
but
only
specimens
of
knowledge
we
are
in
haste
to
seek
for
general
types
and
overlook
individuals
when
we
fall
into
the
habit
of
neglecting
to
use
the
understanding
that
comes
of
sympathy
in
our
travels
our
knowledge
of
foreign
people
grows
insensitive
and
therefore
easily
becomes
both
unjust
and
cruel
in
its
character
and
also
selfish
and
contemptuous
in
its
application
such
has
too
often
been
the
case
with
regard
to
the
meeting
of
western
people
in
our
days
with
others
for
whom
they
do
not
recognise
any
obligation
of
kinship
it
has
been
admitted
that
the
dealings
between
different
races
of
men
are
not
merely
between
individuals
that
our
mutual
understanding
is
either
aided
or
else
obstructed
by
the
general
emanations
forming
the
social
atmosphere
these
emanations
are
our
collective
ideas
and
collective
feelings
generated
according
to
special
historical
circumstances
for
instance
the
is
a
collective
idea
in
india
when
we
approach
an
indian
who
is
under
the
influence
of
this
collective
idea
he
is
no
longer
a
pure
individual
with
his
conscience
fully
awake
to
the
judging
of
the
value
of
a
human
being
he
is
more
or
less
a
passive
medium
for
giving
expression
to
the
sentiment
of
a
whole
community
it
is
evident
that
the
is
not
creative
it
is
merely
institutional
it
adjusts
human
beings
according
to
some
mechanical
arrangement
it
emphasises
the
negative
side
of
the
separateness
it
hurts
the
complete
truth
in
man
in
the
west
also
the
people
have
a
certain
collective
idea
that
obscures
their
humanity
let
me
try
to
explain
what
i
feel
about
it
ii
lately
i
went
to
visit
some
battlefields
of
france
which
had
been
devastated
by
war
the
awful
calm
of
desolation
which
still
bore
wrinkles
of
stiffened
into
ugly
before
my
mind
the
vision
of
a
huge
demon
which
had
no
shape
no
meaning
yet
had
two
arms
that
could
strike
and
break
and
tear
a
gaping
mouth
that
could
devour
and
bulging
brains
that
could
conspire
and
plan
it
was
a
purpose
which
had
a
living
body
but
no
complete
humanity
to
temper
it
because
it
was
to
life
and
yet
not
having
the
wholeness
of
was
the
most
terrible
of
life
enemies
something
of
the
same
sense
of
oppression
in
a
different
degree
the
same
desolation
in
a
different
aspect
is
produced
in
my
mind
when
i
realise
the
effect
of
the
west
upon
eastern
west
which
in
its
relation
to
us
is
all
plan
and
purpose
incarnate
without
any
superfluous
humanity
i
feel
the
contrast
very
strongly
in
japan
in
that
country
the
old
world
presents
itself
with
some
ideal
of
perfection
in
which
man
has
his
varied
opportunities
of
in
art
in
ceremonial
in
religious
faith
and
in
customs
expressing
the
poetry
of
social
relationship
there
one
feels
that
deep
delight
of
hospitality
which
life
offers
to
life
and
side
by
side
in
the
same
soil
stands
the
modern
world
which
is
stupendously
big
and
powerful
but
inhospitable
it
has
no
welcome
for
man
it
is
living
yet
the
incompleteness
of
life
ideal
within
it
can
not
but
hurt
humanity
the
wriggling
tentacles
of
a
utilitarianism
with
which
the
west
has
grasped
all
the
easily
yielding
succulent
portions
of
the
east
are
causing
pain
and
indignation
throughout
the
eastern
countries
the
west
comes
to
us
not
with
the
imagination
and
sympathy
that
create
and
unite
but
with
a
shock
of
for
power
and
wealth
this
passion
is
a
mere
force
which
has
in
it
the
principle
of
separation
of
conflict
i
have
been
fortunate
in
coming
into
close
touch
with
individual
men
and
women
of
the
western
countries
and
have
felt
with
them
their
sorrows
and
shared
their
aspirations
i
have
known
that
they
seek
the
same
god
who
is
my
those
who
deny
him
i
feel
certain
that
if
the
great
light
of
culture
be
extinct
in
europe
our
horizon
in
the
east
will
mourn
in
darkness
it
does
not
hurt
my
pride
to
acknowledge
that
in
the
present
age
western
humanity
has
received
its
mission
to
be
the
teacher
of
the
world
that
her
science
through
the
mastery
of
laws
of
nature
is
to
liberate
human
souls
from
the
dark
dungeon
of
matter
for
this
very
reason
i
have
realised
all
the
more
strongly
on
the
other
hand
that
the
dominant
collective
idea
in
the
western
countries
is
not
creative
it
is
ready
to
enslave
or
kill
individuals
to
drug
a
great
people
with
poison
darkening
their
whole
future
with
the
black
mist
of
stupefaction
and
emasculating
entire
races
of
men
to
the
utmost
degree
of
helplessness
it
is
wholly
wanting
in
spiritual
power
to
blend
and
harmonise
it
lacks
the
sense
of
the
great
personality
of
man
the
most
significant
fact
of
modern
days
is
this
that
the
west
has
met
the
east
such
a
momentous
meeting
of
humanity
in
order
to
be
fruitful
must
have
in
its
heart
some
great
emotional
idea
generous
and
creative
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
god
choice
has
fallen
upon
the
of
the
west
for
the
service
of
the
present
age
arms
and
armour
have
been
given
to
them
but
have
they
yet
realised
in
their
hearts
the
loyalty
to
their
cause
which
can
resist
all
temptations
of
bribery
from
the
devil
the
world
is
offered
to
the
west
she
will
destroy
it
if
she
does
not
use
it
for
a
great
creation
of
man
the
materials
for
such
a
creation
are
in
the
hands
of
science
but
the
creative
genius
is
in
man
spiritual
ideal
iii
when
i
was
young
a
stranger
from
europe
came
to
bengal
he
chose
his
lodging
among
the
people
of
the
country
shared
with
them
their
frugal
diet
and
freely
offered
them
his
service
he
found
employment
in
the
houses
of
the
rich
teaching
them
french
and
german
and
the
money
thus
earned
he
spent
to
help
poor
students
in
buying
books
this
meant
for
him
hours
of
walking
in
the
heat
of
a
tropical
summer
for
intent
upon
exercising
the
utmost
economy
he
refused
to
hire
conveyances
he
was
pitiless
in
his
exaction
from
himself
of
his
resources
in
money
time
and
strength
to
the
point
of
privation
and
all
this
for
the
sake
of
a
people
who
were
obscure
to
whom
he
was
not
born
yet
whom
he
dearly
loved
he
did
not
come
to
us
with
a
professional
mission
of
teaching
sectarian
creeds
he
had
not
in
his
nature
the
least
trace
of
that
of
goodness
which
humiliates
by
gifts
the
victims
of
its
insolent
benevolence
though
he
did
not
know
our
language
he
took
every
occasion
to
frequent
our
meetings
and
ceremonies
yet
he
was
always
afraid
of
intrusion
and
tenderly
anxious
lest
he
might
offend
us
by
his
ignorance
of
our
customs
at
last
under
the
continual
strain
of
work
in
an
alien
climate
and
surroundings
his
health
broke
down
he
died
and
was
cremated
at
our
according
to
his
express
desire
the
attitude
of
his
mind
the
manner
of
his
living
the
object
of
his
life
his
modesty
his
unstinted
for
a
people
who
had
not
even
the
power
to
give
publicity
to
any
benefaction
bestowed
upon
them
were
so
utterly
unlike
anything
we
were
accustomed
to
associate
with
the
europeans
in
india
that
it
gave
rise
in
our
mind
to
a
feeling
of
love
bordering
upon
awe
we
all
have
a
realm
a
private
paradise
in
our
mind
where
dwell
deathless
memories
of
persons
who
brought
some
divine
light
to
our
life
experience
who
may
not
be
known
to
others
and
whose
names
have
no
place
in
the
pages
of
history
let
me
confess
to
you
that
this
man
lives
as
one
of
those
immortals
in
the
paradise
of
my
individual
life
he
came
from
sweden
his
name
was
hammargren
what
was
most
remarkable
in
the
event
of
his
coming
to
us
in
bengal
was
the
fact
that
in
his
own
country
he
had
chanced
to
read
some
works
of
my
great
countryman
ram
mohan
roy
and
felt
an
immense
veneration
for
his
genius
and
his
character
ram
mohan
roy
lived
in
the
beginning
of
the
last
century
and
it
is
no
exaggeration
when
i
describe
him
as
one
of
the
immortal
personalities
of
modern
time
this
young
swede
had
the
unusual
gift
of
a
intellect
and
sympathy
which
enabled
him
even
from
his
distance
of
space
and
time
and
in
spite
of
racial
differences
to
realise
the
greatness
of
ram
mohan
roy
it
moved
him
so
deeply
that
he
resolved
to
go
to
the
country
which
produced
this
great
man
and
offer
her
his
service
he
was
poor
and
he
had
to
wait
some
time
in
england
before
he
could
earn
his
passage
money
to
india
there
he
came
at
last
and
in
reckless
generosity
of
love
utterly
spent
himself
to
the
last
breath
of
his
life
away
from
home
and
kindred
and
all
the
inheritances
of
his
motherland
his
stay
among
us
was
too
short
to
produce
any
outward
result
he
failed
even
to
achieve
during
his
life
what
he
had
in
his
mind
which
was
to
found
by
the
help
of
his
scanty
earnings
a
library
as
a
memorial
to
ram
mohan
roy
and
thus
to
leave
behind
him
a
visible
symbol
of
his
devotion
but
what
i
prize
most
in
this
european
youth
who
left
no
record
of
his
life
behind
him
is
not
the
memory
of
any
service
of
goodwill
but
the
precious
gift
of
respect
which
he
offered
to
a
people
who
are
fallen
upon
evil
times
and
whom
it
is
so
easy
to
ignore
or
to
humiliate
for
the
first
time
in
the
modern
days
this
obscure
individual
from
sweden
brought
to
our
country
the
chivalrous
courtesy
of
the
west
a
greeting
of
human
fellowship
the
coincidence
came
to
me
with
a
great
and
delightful
surprise
when
the
nobel
prize
was
offered
to
me
from
sweden
as
a
recognition
of
individual
merit
it
was
of
great
value
to
me
no
doubt
but
it
was
the
acknowledgment
of
the
east
as
a
collaborator
with
the
western
continents
in
contributing
its
riches
to
the
common
stock
of
civilisation
which
had
the
chief
significance
for
the
present
age
it
meant
joining
hands
in
comradeship
by
the
two
great
hemispheres
of
the
human
world
across
the
sea
iv
the
real
east
remains
unexplored
the
blindness
of
contempt
is
more
hopeless
than
the
blindness
of
ignorance
for
contempt
kills
the
light
which
ignorance
merely
leaves
unignited
the
east
is
waiting
to
be
understood
by
the
western
races
in
order
not
only
to
be
able
to
give
what
is
true
in
her
but
also
to
be
confident
of
her
own
mission
in
indian
history
the
meeting
of
the
mussulman
and
the
hindu
produced
akbar
the
object
of
whose
dream
was
the
unification
of
hearts
and
ideals
it
had
all
the
glowing
enthusiasm
of
a
religion
and
it
produced
an
immediate
and
a
vast
result
even
in
his
own
lifetime
but
the
fact
still
remains
that
the
western
mind
after
centuries
of
contact
with
the
east
has
not
evolved
the
enthusiasm
of
a
chivalrous
ideal
which
can
bring
this
age
to
its
fulfilment
it
is
everywhere
raising
thorny
hedges
of
exclusion
and
offering
human
sacrifices
to
national
it
has
intensified
the
mutual
feelings
of
envy
among
western
races
themselves
as
they
fight
over
their
spoils
and
display
a
carnivorous
pride
in
their
snarling
rows
of
teeth
we
must
again
guard
our
minds
from
any
encroaching
distrust
of
the
individuals
of
a
nation
the
active
love
of
humanity
and
the
spirit
of
martyrdom
for
the
cause
of
justice
and
truth
which
i
have
met
with
in
the
western
countries
have
been
a
great
lesson
and
inspiration
to
me
i
have
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
the
west
owes
its
true
greatness
not
so
much
to
its
marvellous
training
of
intellect
as
to
its
spirit
of
service
devoted
to
the
welfare
of
man
therefore
i
speak
with
a
personal
feeling
of
pain
and
sadness
about
the
collective
power
which
is
guiding
the
helm
of
western
civilisation
it
is
a
passion
not
an
ideal
the
more
success
it
has
brought
to
europe
the
more
costly
it
will
prove
to
her
at
last
when
the
accounts
have
to
be
rendered
and
the
signs
are
unmistakable
that
the
accounts
have
been
called
for
the
time
has
come
when
europe
must
know
that
the
forcible
parasitism
which
she
has
been
practising
upon
the
two
large
continents
of
the
two
most
unwieldy
whales
of
be
causing
to
her
moral
nature
a
gradual
atrophy
and
degeneration
as
an
example
let
me
quote
the
following
extract
from
the
concluding
chapter
of
the
cape
to
by
grogan
and
sharp
two
writers
who
have
the
power
to
inculcate
their
doctrines
by
precept
and
example
in
their
reference
to
the
african
they
are
candid
as
when
they
say
we
have
stolen
his
land
now
we
must
steal
his
limbs
these
two
sentences
carefully
articulated
with
a
smack
of
enjoyment
have
been
more
clearly
explained
in
the
following
statement
where
some
sense
of
that
decency
which
is
the
attenuated
ghost
of
a
buried
conscience
prompts
the
writers
to
use
the
phrase
compulsory
labour
in
place
of
the
honest
word
slavery
just
as
the
modern
politician
adroitly
avoids
the
word
injunction
and
uses
the
word
mandate
compulsory
labour
in
some
form
they
say
is
the
corollary
of
our
occupation
of
the
country
and
they
add
it
is
pathetic
but
it
is
history
implying
thereby
that
moral
sentiments
have
no
serious
effect
in
the
history
of
human
beings
elsewhere
they
write
either
we
must
give
up
the
country
commercially
or
we
must
make
the
african
work
and
mere
abuse
of
those
who
point
out
the
impasse
can
not
change
the
facts
we
must
decide
and
soon
or
rather
the
white
man
of
south
africa
will
decide
the
authors
also
confess
that
they
have
seen
too
much
of
the
world
to
have
any
lingering
belief
that
western
civilisation
benefits
native
races
the
logic
is
logic
of
egoism
but
the
argument
is
simplified
by
lopping
off
the
greater
part
of
the
premise
for
these
writers
seem
to
hold
that
the
only
important
question
for
the
white
men
of
south
africa
is
how
indefinitely
to
grow
fat
on
ostrich
feathers
and
diamond
mines
and
dance
jazz
dances
over
the
misery
and
degradation
of
a
whole
race
of
of
a
different
colour
from
their
own
possibly
they
believe
that
moral
laws
have
a
special
domesticated
breed
of
comfortable
concessions
for
the
service
of
the
people
in
power
possibly
they
ignore
the
fact
that
commercial
and
political
cannibalism
profitably
practised
upon
foreign
races
creeps
back
nearer
home
that
the
cultivation
of
unwholesome
appetites
has
its
final
reckoning
with
the
stomach
which
has
been
made
to
serve
it
for
after
all
man
is
a
spiritual
being
and
not
a
mere
living
jumping
from
profit
to
profit
and
breaking
the
backbone
of
human
races
in
its
financial
leapfrog
such
however
has
been
the
condition
of
things
for
more
than
a
century
and
trying
to
read
the
future
by
the
light
of
the
european
conflagration
we
are
asking
ourselves
everywhere
in
the
east
is
this
frightfully
overgrown
power
really
great
it
can
bruise
us
from
without
but
can
it
add
to
our
wealth
of
spirit
it
can
sign
peace
treaties
but
can
it
give
peace
it
was
about
two
thousand
years
ago
that
rome
in
one
of
its
eastern
provinces
executed
on
a
cross
a
simple
teacher
of
an
obscure
tribe
of
fishermen
on
that
day
the
roman
governor
felt
no
falling
off
of
his
appetite
or
sleep
on
that
day
there
was
on
the
one
hand
the
agony
the
humiliation
the
death
on
the
other
the
pomp
of
pride
and
festivity
in
the
governor
palace
and
to
whom
then
shall
we
bow
the
head
kasmai
devaya
havisha
vidhema
to
which
god
shall
we
offer
oblation
we
know
of
an
instance
in
our
own
history
of
india
when
a
great
personality
both
in
his
life
and
voice
struck
the
keynote
of
the
solemn
music
of
the
for
all
creatures
and
that
music
crossed
seas
mountains
and
deserts
races
belonging
to
different
climates
habits
and
languages
were
drawn
together
not
in
the
clash
of
arms
not
in
the
conflict
of
exploitation
but
in
harmony
of
life
in
amity
and
peace
that
was
creation
when
we
think
of
it
we
see
at
once
what
the
confusion
of
thought
was
to
which
the
western
poet
dwelling
upon
the
difference
between
east
and
west
referred
when
he
said
never
the
twain
shall
meet
it
is
true
that
they
are
not
yet
showing
any
real
sign
of
meeting
but
the
reason
is
because
the
west
has
not
sent
out
its
humanity
to
meet
the
man
in
the
east
but
only
its
machine
therefore
the
poet
line
has
to
be
changed
into
something
like
this
man
is
man
machine
is
machine
and
never
the
twain
shall
you
must
know
that
red
tape
can
never
be
a
common
human
bond
that
official
can
never
provide
means
of
mutual
attachment
that
it
is
a
painful
ordeal
for
human
beings
to
have
to
receive
favours
from
animated
pigeonholes
and
condescensions
from
printed
circulars
that
give
notice
but
never
speak
the
presence
of
the
western
people
in
the
east
is
a
human
fact
if
we
are
to
gain
anything
from
them
it
must
not
be
a
mere
of
legal
codes
and
systems
of
civil
and
military
services
man
is
a
great
deal
more
to
man
than
that
we
have
our
human
birthright
to
claim
direct
help
from
the
man
of
the
west
if
he
has
anything
great
to
give
us
it
must
come
to
us
not
through
mere
facts
in
a
juxtaposition
but
through
the
spontaneous
sacrifice
made
by
those
who
have
the
gift
and
therefore
the
responsibility
earnestly
i
ask
the
poet
of
the
western
world
to
realise
and
sing
to
you
with
all
the
great
power
of
music
which
he
has
that
the
east
and
the
west
are
ever
in
search
of
each
other
and
that
they
must
meet
not
merely
in
the
fulness
of
physical
strength
but
in
fulness
of
truth
that
the
right
hand
which
wields
the
sword
has
the
need
of
the
left
which
holds
the
shield
of
safety
the
east
has
its
seat
in
the
vast
plains
watched
over
by
the
mountains
and
fertilised
by
rivers
carrying
mighty
volumes
of
water
to
the
sea
there
under
the
blaze
of
a
tropical
sun
the
physical
life
has
bedimmed
the
light
of
its
vigour
and
lessened
its
claims
there
man
has
had
the
repose
of
mind
which
has
ever
tried
to
set
itself
in
harmony
with
the
inner
notes
of
existence
in
the
silence
of
sunrise
and
sunset
and
on
nights
he
has
sat
face
to
face
with
the
infinite
waiting
for
the
revelation
that
opens
up
the
heart
of
all
that
there
is
he
has
said
in
a
rapture
of
realisation
hearken
to
me
ye
children
of
the
immortal
who
dwell
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
i
have
known
from
beyond
darkness
the
supreme
person
shining
with
the
radiance
of
the
sun
the
man
from
the
east
with
his
faith
in
the
eternal
who
in
his
soul
had
met
the
touch
of
the
supreme
he
never
come
to
you
in
the
west
and
speak
to
you
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
did
he
not
unite
the
east
and
the
west
in
truth
in
the
unity
of
one
spiritual
bond
between
all
children
of
the
immortal
in
the
realisation
of
one
great
personality
in
all
human
persons
yes
the
east
did
once
meet
the
west
profoundly
in
the
growth
of
her
life
such
union
became
possible
because
the
east
came
to
the
west
with
the
ideal
that
is
creative
and
not
with
the
passion
that
destroys
moral
bonds
the
mystic
consciousness
of
the
infinite
which
she
brought
with
her
was
greatly
needed
by
the
man
of
the
west
to
give
him
his
balance
on
the
other
hand
the
east
must
find
her
own
balance
in
magnificent
gift
that
the
west
can
bring
to
her
truth
has
its
nest
as
well
as
its
sky
that
nest
is
definite
in
structure
accurate
in
law
of
construction
and
though
it
has
to
be
changed
and
rebuilt
over
and
over
again
the
need
of
it
is
and
its
laws
are
eternal
for
some
centuries
the
east
has
neglected
the
of
truth
she
has
not
been
attentive
to
learn
its
secret
trying
to
cross
the
trackless
infinite
the
east
has
relied
solely
upon
her
wings
she
has
spurned
the
earth
till
buffeted
by
storms
her
wings
are
hurt
and
she
is
tired
sorely
needing
help
but
has
she
then
to
be
told
that
the
messenger
of
the
sky
and
the
builder
of
the
nest
shall
never
meet
the
modern
age
i
wherever
man
meets
man
in
a
living
relationship
the
meeting
finds
its
natural
expression
in
works
of
art
the
signatures
of
beauty
in
which
the
mingling
of
the
personal
touch
leaves
its
memorial
on
the
other
hand
a
relationship
of
pure
utility
humiliates
ignores
the
rights
and
needs
of
his
deeper
nature
it
feels
no
compunction
in
maltreating
and
killing
things
of
beauty
that
can
never
be
restored
some
years
ago
when
i
set
out
from
calcutta
on
my
voyage
to
japan
the
first
thing
that
shocked
me
with
a
sense
of
personal
injury
was
the
ruthless
intrusion
of
the
factories
for
making
on
both
banks
of
the
ganges
the
blow
it
gave
to
me
was
owing
to
the
precious
memory
of
the
days
of
my
boyhood
when
the
scenery
of
this
river
was
the
only
great
thing
near
my
birthplace
reminding
me
of
the
existence
of
a
world
which
had
its
direct
communication
with
our
innermost
spirit
calcutta
is
an
upstart
town
with
no
depth
of
sentiment
in
her
face
and
in
her
manners
it
may
truly
be
said
about
her
genesis
the
beginning
there
was
the
spirit
of
the
shop
which
uttered
through
its
megaphone
let
there
be
the
office
and
there
was
calcutta
she
brought
with
her
no
dower
of
distinction
no
majesty
of
noble
or
romantic
origin
she
never
gathered
around
her
any
great
historical
associations
any
annals
of
brave
sufferings
or
memory
of
mighty
deeds
the
only
thing
which
gave
her
the
sacred
baptism
of
beauty
was
the
river
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
be
born
before
the
iron
dragon
had
devoured
the
greater
part
of
the
life
of
its
banks
when
the
descending
into
its
waters
caressed
by
its
tides
appeared
to
me
like
the
loving
arms
of
the
villages
clinging
to
it
when
calcutta
with
her
nose
and
stony
stare
had
not
completely
disowned
her
rural
bengal
and
had
not
surrendered
body
and
soul
to
her
wealthy
paramour
the
spirit
of
the
ledger
bound
in
dead
leather
but
as
an
instance
of
the
contrast
of
the
different
ideal
of
a
different
age
incarnated
in
the
form
of
a
town
the
memory
of
my
last
visit
to
benares
comes
to
my
mind
what
impressed
me
most
deeply
while
i
was
there
was
the
of
the
river
ganges
ever
filling
the
atmosphere
with
an
unheard
melody
attracting
the
whole
population
to
its
bosom
every
hour
of
the
day
i
am
proud
of
the
fact
that
india
has
felt
a
most
profound
love
for
this
river
which
nourishes
civilisation
on
its
banks
guiding
its
course
from
the
silence
of
the
hills
to
the
sea
with
its
myriad
voices
of
solitude
the
love
of
this
river
which
has
become
one
with
the
love
of
the
best
in
man
has
given
rise
to
this
town
as
an
expression
of
reverence
this
is
to
show
that
there
are
sentiments
in
us
which
are
creative
which
do
not
clamour
for
gain
but
overflow
in
gifts
in
spontaneous
generosity
of
but
our
minds
will
nevermore
cease
to
be
haunted
by
the
perturbed
spirit
of
the
question
what
about
i
admit
they
are
indispensable
and
am
willing
to
allow
them
a
place
in
society
if
my
opponent
will
only
admit
that
even
should
have
their
limits
and
will
acknowledge
the
importance
of
leisure
to
man
with
space
for
joy
and
worship
and
a
home
of
wholesale
privacy
with
associations
of
chaste
love
and
mutual
service
if
this
concession
to
humanity
be
denied
or
curtailed
and
if
profit
and
production
are
allowed
to
run
amuck
they
will
play
havoc
with
our
love
of
beauty
of
truth
of
justice
and
also
with
our
love
for
our
so
it
comes
about
that
the
peasant
cultivators
of
jute
who
live
on
the
brink
of
everlasting
famine
are
combined
against
and
driven
to
lower
the
price
of
their
labours
to
the
point
of
blank
despair
by
those
who
earn
more
than
cent
per
cent
profit
and
wallow
in
the
infamy
of
their
wealth
the
facts
that
man
is
brave
and
kind
that
he
is
social
and
generous
and
have
some
aspect
of
the
complete
in
them
but
the
fact
that
he
is
a
manufacturer
of
is
too
ridiculously
small
to
claim
the
right
of
reducing
his
higher
nature
to
insignificance
the
fragmentariness
of
utility
should
never
forget
its
subordinate
position
in
human
affairs
it
must
not
be
permitted
to
occupy
more
than
its
legitimate
place
and
power
in
society
nor
to
have
the
liberty
to
desecrate
the
poetry
of
life
to
deaden
our
sensitiveness
to
ideals
bragging
of
its
own
coarseness
as
a
sign
of
virility
the
pity
is
that
when
in
the
centre
of
our
activities
we
acknowledge
by
some
proud
name
the
supremacy
of
wanton
destructiveness
or
production
not
less
wanton
we
shut
out
all
the
lights
of
our
souls
and
in
that
darkness
our
conscience
and
our
consciousness
of
shame
are
hidden
and
our
love
of
freedom
is
killed
i
do
not
for
a
moment
mean
to
imply
that
in
any
particular
period
of
history
men
were
free
from
the
disturbance
of
their
lower
passions
selfishness
ever
had
its
share
in
government
and
trade
yet
there
was
a
struggle
to
maintain
a
balance
of
forces
in
society
and
our
passions
cherished
no
delusions
about
their
own
rank
and
value
they
contrived
no
clever
devices
to
hoodwink
our
moral
nature
for
in
those
days
our
intellect
was
not
tempted
to
put
its
weight
into
the
balance
on
the
side
of
but
in
recent
centuries
a
devastating
change
has
come
over
our
mentality
with
regard
to
the
acquisition
of
money
whereas
in
former
ages
men
treated
it
with
condescension
even
with
disrespect
now
they
bend
their
knees
to
it
that
it
should
be
allowed
a
sufficiently
large
place
in
society
there
can
be
no
question
but
it
becomes
an
outrage
when
it
occupies
those
seats
which
are
specially
reserved
for
the
immortals
by
bribing
us
tampering
with
our
moral
pride
recruiting
the
best
strength
of
society
in
a
traitor
campaign
against
human
ideals
thus
disguising
with
the
help
of
pomp
and
pageantry
its
true
insignificance
such
a
state
of
things
has
come
to
pass
because
with
the
help
of
science
the
possibilities
of
profit
have
suddenly
become
immoderate
the
whole
of
the
human
world
throughout
its
length
and
breadth
has
felt
the
gravitational
pull
of
a
giant
planet
of
greed
with
concentric
rings
of
innumerable
satellites
causing
in
our
society
a
marked
deviation
from
the
moral
orbit
in
former
times
the
intellectual
and
spiritual
powers
of
this
earth
upheld
their
dignity
of
independence
and
were
not
giddily
rocked
on
the
tides
of
the
money
market
but
as
in
the
last
fatal
stages
of
disease
this
fatal
influence
of
money
has
got
into
our
brain
and
affected
our
heart
like
a
usurper
it
has
occupied
the
throne
of
high
social
ideals
using
every
means
by
menace
and
threat
to
seize
upon
the
right
and
tempted
by
opportunity
presuming
to
judge
it
it
has
not
only
science
for
its
ally
but
other
forces
also
that
have
some
semblance
of
religion
such
as
and
the
idealising
of
organised
selfishness
its
methods
are
and
sure
like
the
claws
of
a
tiger
paw
they
are
softly
sheathed
its
massacres
are
invisible
because
they
are
fundamental
attacking
the
very
roots
of
life
its
plunder
is
ruthless
behind
a
scientific
system
of
screens
which
have
the
formal
appearance
of
being
open
and
responsible
to
inquiries
by
whitewashing
its
stains
it
keeps
its
respectability
unblemished
it
makes
a
liberal
use
of
falsehood
in
diplomacy
only
feeling
embarrassed
when
its
evidence
is
disclosed
by
others
of
the
trade
an
unscrupulous
system
of
propaganda
paves
the
way
for
widespread
misrepresentation
it
works
up
the
crowd
psychology
through
regulated
hypnotic
doses
at
repeated
intervals
administered
in
bottles
with
moral
labels
upon
them
of
soothing
colours
in
fact
man
has
been
able
to
make
his
pursuit
of
power
easier
by
his
art
of
mitigating
the
obstructive
forces
that
come
from
the
higher
region
of
his
humanity
with
his
cult
of
power
and
his
idolatry
of
money
he
has
in
a
great
measure
reverted
to
his
primitive
barbarism
a
barbarism
whose
path
is
lit
up
by
the
lurid
light
of
intellect
for
barbarism
is
the
simplicity
of
a
superficial
life
it
may
be
bewildering
in
its
surface
adornments
and
complexities
but
it
lacks
the
ideal
to
impart
to
it
the
depth
of
moral
responsibility
ii
society
suffers
from
a
profound
feeling
of
unhappiness
not
so
much
when
it
is
in
material
poverty
as
when
its
members
are
deprived
of
a
large
part
of
their
humanity
this
unhappiness
goes
on
smouldering
in
the
subconscious
mind
of
the
community
till
its
life
is
reduced
to
ashes
or
a
sudden
combustion
is
produced
the
repressed
personality
of
man
generates
an
inflammable
moral
gas
deadly
in
its
explosive
force
we
have
seen
in
the
late
war
and
also
in
some
of
the
still
more
recent
events
of
history
how
human
individuals
freed
from
moral
and
spiritual
bonds
find
a
boisterous
joy
in
a
debauchery
of
destruction
there
is
generated
a
disinterested
passion
of
ravage
through
such
catastrophe
we
can
realise
what
formidable
forces
of
annihilation
are
kept
in
check
in
our
communities
by
bonds
of
social
ideas
nay
made
into
multitudinous
manifestations
of
beauty
and
fruitfulness
thus
we
know
that
evils
are
like
meteors
stray
fragments
of
life
which
need
the
attraction
of
some
great
ideal
in
order
to
be
assimilated
with
the
wholesomeness
of
creation
the
evil
forces
are
literally
outlaws
they
only
need
the
control
and
cadence
of
spiritual
laws
to
change
them
into
good
the
true
goodness
is
not
the
negation
of
badness
it
is
in
the
mastery
of
it
goodness
is
the
miracle
which
turns
the
tumult
of
chaos
into
a
dance
of
beauty
in
modern
society
the
ideal
of
wholeness
has
lost
its
force
therefore
its
different
sections
have
become
detached
and
resolved
into
their
elemental
character
of
forces
labour
is
a
force
so
also
is
capital
so
are
the
government
and
the
people
so
are
man
and
woman
it
is
said
that
when
the
forces
lying
latent
in
even
a
handful
of
dust
are
liberated
from
their
bond
of
unity
they
can
lift
the
buildings
of
a
whole
neighbourhood
to
the
height
of
a
mountain
such
disfranchised
forces
irresponsible
may
be
useful
to
us
for
certain
purposes
but
human
habitations
standing
secure
on
their
foundations
are
better
for
us
to
own
the
secret
of
utilising
these
forces
is
a
proud
fact
for
us
but
the
power
of
and
the
of
love
are
truer
subjects
for
the
exultation
of
mankind
the
genii
of
the
arabian
nights
may
have
in
their
magic
their
lure
and
fascination
for
us
but
the
consciousness
of
god
is
of
another
order
infinitely
more
precious
in
imparting
to
our
minds
ideas
of
the
spiritual
power
of
creation
yet
these
genii
are
abroad
everywhere
and
even
now
after
the
late
war
their
devotees
are
getting
ready
to
play
further
tricks
upon
humanity
by
suddenly
spiriting
it
away
to
some
of
desolation
iii
we
know
that
when
at
first
any
large
body
of
people
in
their
history
became
aware
of
their
unity
they
expressed
it
in
some
popular
symbol
of
divinity
for
they
felt
that
their
combination
was
not
an
arithmetical
one
its
truth
was
deeper
than
the
truth
of
number
they
felt
that
their
community
was
not
a
mere
agglutination
but
a
creation
having
upon
it
the
living
touch
of
the
infinite
person
the
realisation
of
this
truth
having
been
an
end
in
itself
a
fulfilment
it
gave
meaning
to
to
the
acceptance
even
of
death
but
our
modern
education
is
producing
a
habit
of
mind
which
is
ever
weakening
in
us
the
spiritual
apprehension
of
truth
of
a
person
as
the
ultimate
reality
of
existence
science
has
its
proper
sphere
in
analysing
this
world
as
a
construction
just
as
grammar
has
its
legitimate
office
in
analysing
the
syntax
of
a
poem
but
the
world
as
a
creation
is
not
a
mere
construction
it
too
is
more
than
a
syntax
it
is
a
poem
which
we
are
apt
to
forget
when
grammar
takes
exclusive
hold
of
our
minds
upon
the
loss
of
this
sense
of
a
universal
personality
which
is
religion
the
reign
of
the
machine
and
of
method
has
been
firmly
established
and
man
humanly
speaking
has
been
made
a
homeless
tramp
as
nomads
ravenous
and
restless
the
men
from
the
west
have
come
to
us
they
have
exploited
our
eastern
humanity
for
sheer
gain
of
power
this
modern
meeting
of
men
has
not
yet
received
the
blessing
of
god
for
it
has
kept
us
apart
though
railway
lines
are
laid
far
and
wide
and
ships
are
plying
from
shore
to
shore
to
bring
us
together
it
has
been
said
in
the

he
who

the

and
the

spirit
in
all
beings
remains
no
longer
unrevealed
in
the
modern
civilisation
for
which
an
enormous
number
of
men
are
used
as
materials
and
human
relationships
have
in
a
large
measure
become
utilitarian
man
is
imperfectly
revealed
for
man
revelation
does
not
lie
in
the
fact
that
he
is
a
power
but
that
he
is
a
spirit
the
prevalence
of
the
theory
which
realises
the
power
of
the
machine
in
the
universe
and
organises
men
into
machines
is
like
the
eruption
of
etna
tremendous
in
its
force
in
its
outburst
of
fire
and
fume
but
its
creeping
lava
covers
up
human
shelters
made
by
the
ages
and
its
ashes
smother
life
iv
the
terribly
efficient
method
of
repressing
personality
in
the
individuals
and
the
races
who
have
failed
to
resist
it
has
in
the
present
scientific
age
spread
all
over
the
world
and
in
consequence
there
have
appeared
signs
of
a
universal
disruption
which
seems
not
far
off
faced
with
the
possibility
of
such
a
disaster
which
is
sure
to
affect
the
successful
peoples
of
the
world
in
their
intemperate
prosperity
the
great
powers
of
the
west
are
seeking
peace
not
by
curbing
their
greed
or
by
giving
up
the
exclusive
advantages
which
they
have
unjustly
acquired
but
by
concentrating
their
forces
for
mutual
security
but
can
powers
find
their
equilibrium
in
themselves
power
has
to
be
made
secure
not
only
against
power
but
also
against
weakness
for
there
lies
the
peril
of
its
losing
balance
the
weak
are
as
great
a
danger
for
the
strong
as
quicksands
for
an
elephant
they
do
not
assist
progress
because
they
do
not
resist
they
only
drag
down
the
people
who
grow
accustomed
to
wield
absolute
power
over
others
are
apt
to
forget
that
by
so
doing
they
generate
an
unseen
force
which
some
day
rends
that
power
into
pieces
the
dumb
fury
of
the
downtrodden
finds
its
awful
support
from
the
universal
law
of
moral
balance
the
air
which
is
so
thin
and
unsubstantial
gives
birth
to
storms
that
nothing
can
resist
this
has
been
proved
in
history
over
and
over
again
and
stormy
forces
arising
from
the
revolt
of
insulted
humanity
are
openly
gathering
in
the
air
at
the
present
time
yet
in
the
psychology
of
the
strong
the
lesson
is
despised
and
no
count
taken
of
the
terribleness
of
the
weak
this
is
the
latent
ignorance
that
like
an
unsuspected
worm
burrows
under
the
bulk
of
the
prosperous
have
we
never
read
of
the
castle
of
power
securely
buttressed
on
all
sides
in
a
moment
dissolving
in
air
at
the
explosion
caused
by
the
weak
and
outraged
besiegers
politicians
calculate
upon
the
number
of
mailed
hands
that
are
kept
on
the
they
do
not
possess
the
third
eye
to
see
the
great
invisible
hand
that
clasps
in
silence
the
hand
of
the
helpless
and
waits
its
time
the
strong
form
their
league
by
a
combination
of
powers
driving
the
weak
to
form
their
own
league
alone
with
their
god
i
know
i
am
crying
in
the
wilderness
when
i
raise
the
voice
of
warning
and
while
the
west
is
busy
with
its
organisation
of
a
peace
it
will
still
continue
to
nourish
by
its
iniquities
the
underground
forces
of
earthquake
in
the
eastern
continent
the
west
seems
unconscious
that
science
by
providing
it
with
more
and
more
power
is
tempting
it
to
suicide
and
encouraging
it
to
accept
the
challenge
of
the
disarmed
it
does
not
know
that
the
challenge
comes
from
a
higher
source
two
prophecies
about
the
world
salvation
are
cherished
in
the
hearts
of
the
two
great
religions
of
the
world
they
represent
the
highest
expectation
of
man
thereby
indicating
his
faith
in
a
truth
which
he
instinctively
considers
as
truth
of
love
these
prophecies
have
not
for
their
vision
the
fettering
of
the
world
and
reducing
it
to
tameness
by
means
of
a
power
forged
in
the
factory
of
a
political
steel
trust
one
of
the
religions
has
for
its
meditation
the
image
of
the
buddha
who
is
to
come
maitreya
the
buddha
of
love
and
he
is
to
bring
peace
the
other
religion
waits
for
the
coming
of
christ
for
christ
preached
peace
when
he
preached
love
when
he
preached
the
oneness
of
the
father
with
the
brothers
who
are
many
and
this
was
the
truth
of
peace
christ
never
held
that
peace
was
the
best
policy
for
policy
is
not
truth
the
calculation
of
can
never
successfully
fight
the
irrational
force
of
passion
which
is
perversion
of
love
and
which
can
only
be
set
right
by
the
truth
of
love
so
long
as
the
powers
build
a
league
on
the
foundation
of
their
desire
for
safety
secure
enjoyment
of
gains
consolidation
of
past
injustice
and
putting
off
the
reparation
of
wrongs
while
their
fingers
still
wriggle
for
greed
and
reek
of
blood
rifts
will
appear
in
their
union
and
in
future
their
conflicts
will
take
greater
force
and
magnitude
it
is
political
and
commercial
egoism
which
is
the
evil
harbinger
of
war
by
different
combinations
it
changes
its
shape
and
dimensions
but
not
its
nature
this
egoism
is
still
held
sacred
and
made
a
religion
and
such
a
religion
by
a
mere
change
of
temple
and
by
new
committees
of
priests
will
never
save
mankind
we
must
know
that
as
through
science
and
commerce
the
realisation
of
the
unity
of
the
material
world
gives
us
power
so
the
realisation
of
the
great
spiritual
unity
of
man
alone
can
give
us
peace
the
spirit
of
freedom
a
letter
from
new
york
to
the
author
own
countrymen
when
freedom
is
not
an
inner
idea
which
imparts
strength
to
our
activities
and
breadth
to
our
creations
when
it
is
merely
a
thing
of
external
circumstance
it
is
like
an
open
space
to
one
who
is
blindfolded
in
my
recent
travels
in
the
west
i
have
felt
that
out
there
freedom
as
an
idea
has
become
feeble
and
ineffectual
consequently
a
spirit
of
repression
and
coercion
is
fast
spreading
in
the
politics
and
social
relationships
of
the
people
in
the
age
of
monarchy
the
king
lived
surrounded
by
a
miasma
of
intrigue
at
court
there
was
an
endless
whispering
of
lies
and
calumny
and
much
plotting
and
planning
among
the
conspiring
courtiers
to
manipulate
the
king
as
the
instrument
of
their
own
purposes
in
the
present
age
intrigue
plays
a
wider
part
and
affects
the
whole
country
the
people
are
drugged
with
the
hashish
of
false
hopes
and
urged
to
deeds
of
frightfulness
by
the
goadings
of
manufactured
panics
their
higher
feelings
are
exploited
by
devious
channels
of
unctuous
hypocrisy
their
pockets
picked
under
anæsthetics
of
flattery
their
very
psychology
affected
by
a
conspiracy
of
money
and
unscrupulous
diplomacy
in
the
old
order
the
king
was
given
to
understand
that
he
was
the
freest
individual
in
the
world
a
greater
semblance
of
external
freedom
no
doubt
he
had
than
other
individuals
but
they
built
for
him
a
gorgeous
prison
of
unreality
the
same
thing
is
happening
now
with
the
people
of
the
west
they
are
flattered
into
believing
that
they
are
free
and
they
have
the
sovereign
power
in
their
hands
but
this
power
is
robbed
by
hosts
of
and
the
horse
is
captured
and
stabled
because
of
his
gift
of
freedom
over
space
the
is
allowed
the
enjoyment
of
an
apparent
liberty
while
its
true
freedom
is
curtailed
on
every
side
its
thoughts
are
fashioned
according
to
the
plans
of
organised
interest
in
its
choosing
of
ideas
and
forming
of
opinions
it
is
hindered
either
by
some
punitive
force
or
by
the
constant
insinuation
of
untruths
it
is
made
to
dwell
in
an
artificial
world
of
hypnotic
phrases
in
fact
the
people
have
become
the
storehouse
of
a
power
that
attracts
round
it
a
swarm
of
adventurers
who
are
secretly
investing
its
walls
to
exploit
it
for
their
own
devices
thus
it
has
become
more
and
more
evident
to
me
that
the
ideal
of
freedom
has
grown
tenuous
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
west
the
mentality
is
that
of
a
community
with
a
mutilated
multitude
of
men
tied
to
its
commercial
and
political
treadmill
it
is
the
mentality
of
mutual
distrust
and
fear
the
appalling
scenes
of
inhumanity
and
injustice
which
are
growing
familiar
to
us
are
the
outcome
of
a
psychology
that
deals
with
terror
no
cruelty
can
be
uglier
in
its
ferocity
than
the
cruelty
of
the
coward
the
people
who
have
sacrificed
their
souls
to
the
passion
of
and
the
drunkenness
of
power
are
constantly
pursued
by
phantoms
of
panic
and
suspicion
and
therefore
they
are
ruthless
even
where
they
are
least
afraid
of
mischances
they
become
morally
incapable
of
allowing
freedom
to
others
and
in
their
eagerness
to
curry
favour
with
the
powerful
they
not
only
connive
at
the
injustice
done
by
their
own
partners
in
political
gambling
but
participate
in
it
a
perpetual
anxiety
for
the
protection
of
their
gains
at
any
cost
strikes
at
the
love
of
freedom
and
justice
until
at
length
they
are
ready
to
forgo
liberty
for
themselves
and
for
others
my
experience
in
the
west
where
i
have
realised
the
immense
power
of
money
and
of
organised
propaganda
everywhere
behind
screens
of
camouflage
creating
an
atmosphere
of
distrust
timidity
and
antipathy
impressed
me
deeply
with
the
truth
that
real
freedom
is
of
the
mind
and
spirit
it
can
never
come
to
us
from
outside
he
only
has
freedom
who
ideally
loves
freedom
himself
and
is
glad
to
extend
it
to
others
he
who
cares
to
have
slaves
must
chain
himself
to
them
he
who
builds
walls
to
create
exclusion
for
others
builds
walls
across
his
own
freedom
he
who
distrusts
freedom
in
others
loses
his
moral
right
to
it
sooner
or
later
he
is
lured
into
the
meshes
of
physical
and
moral
servility
therefore
i
would
urge
my
own
countrymen
to
ask
themselves
if
the
freedom
to
which
they
aspire
is
one
of
external
conditions
is
it
merely
a
transferable
commodity
have
they
acquired
a
true
love
of
freedom
have
they
faith
in
it
are
they
ready
to
make
space
in
their
society
for
the
minds
of
their
children
to
grow
up
in
the
ideal
of
human
dignity
unhindered
by
restrictions
that
are
unjust
and
irrational
have
we
not
made
elaborately
permanent
the
walls
of
our
social
compartments
we
are
tenaciously
proud
of
their
exclusiveness
we
boast
that
in
this
world
no
other
society
but
our
own
has
come
to
finality
in
the
classifying
of
its
living
members
yet
in
our
political
agitations
we
conveniently
forget
that
any
unnaturalness
in
the
relationship
of
governors
and
governed
which
humiliates
us
becomes
an
outrage
when
it
is
artificially
fixed
under
the
threat
of
military
persecution
when
india
gave
voice
to
immortal
thoughts
in
the
time
of
fullest
vigour
of
vitality
her
children
had
the
fearless
spirit
of
the
seekers
of
truth
the
great
epic
of
the
soul
of
our
us
a
wonderful
vision
of
an
overflowing
life
full
of
the
freedom
of
inquiry
and
experiment
when
the
age
of
the
buddha
came
humanity
was
stirred
in
our
country
to
its
uttermost
depth
the
freedom
of
mind
which
it
produced
expressed
itself
in
a
wealth
of
creation
spreading
everywhere
in
its
richness
over
the
continent
of
asia
but
with
the
ebb
of
life
in
india
the
spirit
of
creation
died
away
it
hardened
into
an
age
of
inert
construction
the
organic
unity
of
a
varied
and
elastic
society
gave
way
to
a
conventional
order
which
proved
its
artificial
character
by
its
inexorable
law
of
exclusion
life
has
its
inequalities
i
admit
but
they
are
natural
and
are
in
harmony
with
our
vital
functions
the
head
keeps
its
place
apart
from
the
feet
not
through
some
external
arrangement
or
any
conspiracy
of
coercion
if
the
body
is
compelled
to
turn
somersaults
for
an
indefinite
period
the
head
never
exchanges
its
relative
function
for
that
of
the
feet
but
have
our
social
divisions
the
same
inevitableness
of
organic
law
if
we
have
the
hardihood
to
say
yes
to
that
question
then
how
can
we
blame
an
alien
people
for
subjecting
us
to
a
political
order
which
they
are
tempted
to
believe
eternal
by
squeezing
human
beings
in
the
grip
of
an
inelastic
system
and
forcibly
holding
them
fixed
we
have
ignored
the
laws
of
life
and
growth
we
have
forced
living
souls
into
a
permanent
passivity
making
them
incapable
of
moulding
circumstance
to
their
own
intrinsic
design
and
of
mastering
their
own
destiny
borrowing
our
ideal
of
life
from
a
dark
period
of
our
degeneracy
we
have
covered
up
our
sensitiveness
of
soul
under
the
immovable
weight
of
a
remote
past
we
have
set
up
an
elaborate
ceremonial
of
and
plucked
all
the
feathers
from
the
wings
of
the
living
spirit
of
our
people
and
for
us
our
centuries
of
degradation
and
insult
with
the
amorphousness
of
our
national
unity
with
our
helplessness
before
the
attack
of
disasters
from
without
and
our
unreasoning
from
within
punishment
has
been
terrible
our
stupefaction
has
become
so
absolute
that
we
do
not
even
realise
that
this
persistent
misfortune
dogging
our
steps
for
ages
can
not
be
a
mere
accident
of
history
removable
only
by
another
accident
from
outside
unless
we
have
true
faith
in
freedom
knowing
it
to
be
creative
manfully
taking
all
its
risks
not
only
do
we
lose
the
right
to
claim
freedom
in
politics
but
we
also
lack
the
power
to
maintain
it
with
all
our
strength
for
that
would
be
like
assigning
the
service
of
god
to
a
confirmed
atheist
and
men
who
contemptuously
treat
their
own
brothers
and
sisters
as
eternal
babies
never
to
be
trusted
in
the
most
trivial
details
of
their
personal
life
them
at
every
step
by
the
cruel
threat
of
persecution
into
following
a
blind
lane
leading
to
nowhere
driving
a
number
of
them
into
hypocrisy
and
into
moral
inertia
fail
over
and
over
again
to
rise
to
the
height
of
their
true
and
severe
responsibility
they
will
be
incapable
of
holding
a
just
freedom
in
politics
and
of
fighting
in
cause
the
civilisation
of
the
west
has
in
it
the
spirit
of
the
machine
which
must
move
and
to
that
blind
movement
human
lives
are
offered
as
fuel
keeping
up
the
it
represents
the
active
aspect
of
inertia
which
has
the
appearance
of
freedom
but
not
its
truth
and
therefore
gives
rise
to
slavery
both
within
its
boundaries
and
outside
the
present
civilisation
of
india
has
the
constraining
power
of
the
mould
it
squeezes
living
man
in
the
grip
of
rigid
regulations
and
its
repression
of
individual
freedom
makes
it
only
too
easy
for
men
to
be
forced
into
submission
of
all
kinds
and
degrees
in
both
of
these
traditions
life
is
offered
up
to
something
which
is
not
life
it
is
a
sacrifice
which
has
no
god
for
its
worship
and
is
therefore
utterly
in
vain
the
west
is
continually
producing
mechanical
power
in
excess
of
its
spiritual
control
and
india
has
produced
a
system
of
mechanical
control
in
excess
of
its
vitality
the
nation
the
peoples
are
living
beings
they
have
their
distinct
personalities
but
nations
are
organisations
of
power
and
therefore
their
inner
aspects
and
outward
expressions
are
everywhere
monotonously
the
same
their
differences
are
merely
differences
in
degree
of
efficiency
in
the
modern
world
the
fight
is
going
on
between
the
living
spirit
of
the
people
and
the
methods
of
it
is
like
the
struggle
that
began
in
central
asia
between
cultivated
areas
of
habitation
and
the
continually
encroaching
desert
sands
till
the
human
region
of
life
and
beauty
was
choked
out
of
existence
when
the
spread
of
higher
ideals
of
humanity
is
not
held
to
be
important
the
hardening
method
of
national
efficiency
gains
a
certain
strength
and
for
some
limited
period
of
time
at
least
it
proudly
asserts
itself
as
the
fittest
to
survive
but
it
is
the
survival
of
that
part
of
man
which
is
the
least
living
and
this
is
the
reason
why
dead
monotony
is
the
sign
of
the
spread
of
the
nation
the
modern
towns
which
present
the
physiognomy
due
to
this
dominance
of
the
nation
are
everywhere
the
same
from
san
francisco
to
london
from
london
to
tokyo
they
show
no
faces
but
merely
masks
the
peoples
being
living
personalities
must
have
their
and
this
leads
to
their
distinctive
creations
these
creations
are
literature
art
social
symbols
and
ceremonials
they
are
like
different
dishes
at
one
common
feast
they
add
richness
to
our
enjoyment
and
understanding
of
truth
they
are
making
the
world
of
man
fertile
of
life
and
variedly
beautiful
but
the
nations
do
not
create
they
merely
produce
and
destroy
organisations
for
production
are
necessary
even
organisations
for
destruction
may
be
so
but
when
actuated
by
greed
and
hatred
they
crowd
away
into
a
corner
the
living
man
who
creates
then
the
harmony
is
lost
and
the
people
history
runs
at
a
speed
towards
some
fatal
catastrophe
humanity
where
it
is
living
is
guided
by
inner
ideals
but
where
it
is
a
dead
organisation
it
becomes
impervious
to
them
its
building
process
is
only
an
external
process
and
in
its
response
to
the
moral
guidance
it
has
to
pass
through
obstacles
that
are
gross
and
man
as
a
person
has
his
individuality
which
is
the
field
where
his
spirit
has
its
freedom
to
express
itself
and
to
grow
the
professional
man
carries
a
rigid
crust
around
him
which
has
very
little
variation
and
hardly
any
elasticity
this
professionalism
is
the
region
where
men
specialise
their
knowledge
and
organise
their
power
mercilessly
elbowing
each
other
in
their
struggle
to
come
to
the
front
professionalism
is
necessary
without
doubt
but
it
must
not
be
allowed
to
exceed
its
healthy
limits
to
assume
complete
mastery
over
the
personal
man
making
him
narrow
and
hard
exclusively
intent
upon
pursuit
of
success
at
the
cost
of
his
faith
in
ideals
in
ancient
india
professions
were
kept
within
limits
by
social
regulation
they
were
considered
primarily
as
social
necessities
and
in
the
second
place
as
the
means
of
livelihood
for
individuals
thus
man
being
free
from
the
constant
urging
of
unbounded
competition
could
have
leisure
to
cultivate
his
nature
in
its
completeness
the
cult
of
the
nation
is
the
professionalism
of
the
people
this
cult
is
becoming
their
greatest
danger
because
it
is
bringing
them
enormous
success
making
them
impatient
of
the
claims
of
higher
ideals
the
greater
the
amount
of
success
the
stronger
are
the
conflicts
of
interest
and
jealousy
and
hatred
which
are
aroused
in
men
minds
thereby
making
it
more
and
more
necessary
for
other
peoples
who
are
still
living
to
stiffen
into
nations
with
the
growth
of
nationalism
man
has
become
the
greatest
menace
to
man
therefore
the
continual
presence
of
panic
goads
that
very
nationalism
into
menace
crowd
psychology
is
a
blind
force
like
steam
and
other
physical
forces
it
can
be
utilised
for
creating
a
tremendous
amount
of
power
and
therefore
rulers
of
men
who
out
of
greed
and
fear
are
bent
upon
turning
their
peoples
into
machines
of
power
try
to
train
this
crowd
psychology
for
their
special
purposes
they
hold
it
to
be
their
duty
to
foster
in
the
popular
mind
universal
panic
unreasoning
pride
in
their
own
race
and
hatred
of
others
newspapers
and
even
religious
services
are
made
use
of
for
this
object
and
those
who
have
the
courage
to
express
their
disapprobation
of
this
blind
and
impious
cult
are
either
punished
in
the
or
are
socially
ostracised
the
individual
thinks
even
when
he
feels
but
the
same
individual
when
he
feels
with
the
crowd
does
not
reason
at
all
his
moral
sense
becomes
blurred
this
suppression
of
higher
humanity
in
crowd
minds
is
productive
of
enormous
strength
for
the
crowd
mind
is
essentially
primitive
its
forces
are
elemental
therefore
the
nation
is
for
ever
watching
to
take
advantage
of
this
enormous
power
of
darkness
the
people
instinct
of
has
been
made
dominant
at
particular
times
of
crisis
then
for
the
time
being
the
consciousness
of
its
solidarity
becomes
aggressively
but
in
the
nation
this
is
kept
alive
for
all
time
by
artificial
means
a
man
has
to
act
the
part
of
a
policeman
when
he
finds
his
house
invaded
by
burglars
but
if
that
remains
his
normal
condition
then
his
consciousness
of
his
household
becomes
acute
and
making
him
fly
at
every
stranger
passing
near
his
house
this
intensity
of
is
nothing
of
which
a
man
should
feel
proud
certainly
it
is
not
healthful
in
like
manner
incessant
in
a
nation
is
highly
injurious
for
the
people
it
serves
its
immediate
purpose
but
at
the
cost
of
the
eternal
in
man
when
a
whole
body
of
men
train
themselves
for
a
particular
narrow
purpose
it
becomes
a
common
interest
with
them
to
keep
up
that
purpose
and
preach
absolute
loyalty
to
it
nationalism
is
the
training
of
a
whole
people
for
a
narrow
ideal
and
when
it
gets
hold
of
their
minds
it
is
sure
to
lead
them
to
moral
degeneracy
and
intellectual
blindness
we
can
not
but
hold
firm
the
faith
that
this
age
of
nationalism
of
gigantic
vanity
and
selfishness
is
only
a
passing
phase
in
civilisation
and
those
who
are
making
permanent
arrangements
for
accommodating
this
temporary
mood
of
history
will
be
unable
to
fit
themselves
for
the
coming
age
when
the
true
spirit
of
freedom
will
have
sway
with
the
unchecked
growth
of
nationalism
the
moral
foundation
of
civilisation
is
unconsciously
undergoing
a
change
the
ideal
of
the
social
man
is
unselfishness
but
the
ideal
of
the
nation
like
that
of
the
professional
man
is
selfishness
this
is
why
selfishness
in
the
individual
is
condemned
while
in
the
nation
it
is
extolled
which
leads
to
hopeless
moral
blindness
confusing
the
religion
of
the
people
with
the
religion
of
the
nation
therefore
to
take
an
example
we
find
men
more
and
more
convinced
of
the
superior
claims
of
christianity
merely
because
christian
nations
are
in
possession
of
the
greater
part
of
the
world
it
is
like
supporting
a
religion
by
quoting
the
amount
of
his
stolen
property
nations
celebrate
their
successful
massacre
of
men
in
their
churches
they
forget
that
thugs
also
ascribed
their
success
in
manslaughter
to
the
favour
of
their
goddess
but
in
the
case
of
the
latter
their
goddess
frankly
represented
the
principle
of
destruction
it
was
the
criminal
tribe
own
murderous
instinct
instinct
not
of
one
individual
but
of
the
whole
community
and
therefore
held
sacred
in
the
same
manner
in
modern
churches
selfishness
hatred
and
vanity
in
their
collective
aspect
of
national
instincts
do
not
scruple
to
share
the
homage
paid
to
god
of
course
pursuit
of
need
not
be
wholly
selfish
it
can
even
be
in
harmony
with
the
interest
of
all
therefore
ideally
speaking
the
nationalism
which
stands
for
the
expression
of
the
collective
of
a
people
need
not
be
ashamed
of
itself
if
it
maintains
its
true
limitations
but
what
we
see
in
practice
is
that
every
nation
which
has
prospered
has
done
so
through
its
career
of
aggressive
selfishness
either
in
commercial
adventures
or
in
foreign
possessions
or
in
both
and
this
material
prosperity
not
only
feeds
continually
the
selfish
instincts
of
the
people
but
impresses
men
minds
with
the
lesson
that
for
a
nation
selfishness
is
a
necessity
and
therefore
a
virtue
it
is
the
emphasis
laid
in
europe
upon
the
idea
of
the
nation
constant
increase
of
power
which
is
becoming
the
greatest
danger
to
man
both
in
its
direct
activity
and
its
power
of
infection
we
must
admit
that
evils
there
are
in
human
nature
in
spite
of
our
faith
in
moral
laws
and
our
training
in
but
they
carry
on
their
foreheads
their
own
brand
of
infamy
their
very
success
adding
to
their
monstrosity
all
through
man
history
there
will
be
some
who
suffer
and
others
who
cause
suffering
the
conquest
of
evil
will
never
be
a
fully
accomplished
fact
but
a
continuous
process
like
the
process
of
burning
in
a
flame
in
former
ages
when
some
particular
people
became
turbulent
and
tried
to
rob
others
of
their
human
rights
they
sometimes
achieved
success
and
sometimes
failed
and
it
amounted
to
nothing
more
than
that
but
when
this
idea
of
the
nation
which
has
met
with
universal
acceptance
in
the
present
day
tries
to
pass
off
the
cult
of
collective
selfishness
as
a
moral
duty
simply
because
that
selfishness
is
gigantic
in
stature
it
not
only
commits
depredation
but
attacks
the
very
vitals
of
humanity
it
unconsciously
generates
in
people
minds
an
attitude
of
defiance
against
moral
law
for
men
are
taught
by
repeated
devices
the
lesson
that
the
nation
is
greater
than
the
people
while
yet
it
scatters
to
the
winds
the
moral
law
that
the
people
have
held
sacred
it
has
been
said
that
a
disease
becomes
most
acutely
critical
when
the
brain
is
affected
for
it
is
the
brain
that
is
constantly
directing
the
siege
against
all
disease
forces
the
spirit
of
national
selfishness
is
that
brain
disease
of
a
people
which
shows
itself
in
red
eyes
and
clenched
fists
in
violence
of
talk
and
movements
all
the
while
shattering
its
natural
restorative
powers
but
the
power
of
together
with
the
moral
faculty
of
sympathy
and
is
the
guiding
spirit
of
social
vitality
its
function
is
to
maintain
a
beneficent
relation
of
harmony
with
its
surroundings
but
when
it
begins
to
ignore
the
moral
law
which
is
universal
and
uses
it
only
within
the
bounds
of
its
own
narrow
sphere
then
its
strength
becomes
like
the
strength
of
madness
which
ends
in
what
is
worse
this
aberration
of
a
people
decked
with
the
showy
title
of
patriotism
proudly
walks
abroad
passing
itself
off
as
a
highly
moral
influence
thus
it
has
spread
its
inflammatory
contagion
all
over
the
world
proclaiming
its
fever
flush
to
be
the
best
sign
of
health
it
is
causing
in
the
hearts
of
peoples
naturally
inoffensive
a
feeling
of
envy
at
not
having
their
temperature
as
high
as
that
of
their
delirious
neighbours
and
not
being
able
to
cause
as
much
mischief
but
merely
having
to
suffer
from
it
i
have
often
been
asked
by
my
western
friends
how
to
cope
with
this
evil
which
has
attained
such
sinister
strength
and
vast
dimensions
in
fact
i
have
often
been
blamed
for
merely
giving
warning
and
offering
no
alternative
when
we
suffer
as
a
result
of
a
particular
system
we
believe
that
some
other
system
would
bring
us
better
luck
we
are
apt
to
forget
that
all
systems
produce
evil
sooner
or
later
when
the
psychology
which
is
at
the
root
of
them
is
wrong
the
system
which
is
national
may
assume
the
shape
of
the
international
but
so
long
as
men
have
not
forsaken
their
idolatry
of
primitive
instincts
and
collective
passions
the
new
system
will
only
become
a
new
instrument
of
suffering
and
because
we
are
trained
to
confound
efficient
system
with
moral
goodness
itself
every
ruined
system
makes
us
more
and
more
distrustful
of
moral
law
therefore
i
do
not
put
my
faith
in
any
new
institution
but
in
the
individuals
all
over
the
world
who
think
clearly
feel
nobly
and
act
rightly
thus
becoming
the
channels
of
moral
truth
our
moral
ideals
do
not
work
with
chisels
and
hammers
like
trees
they
spread
their
roots
in
the
soil
and
their
branches
in
the
sky
without
consulting
any
architect
for
their
plans
woman
and
home
creative
expressions
attain
their
perfect
form
through
emotions
modulated
woman
has
that
expression
natural
to
cadence
of
restraint
in
her
behaviour
producing
poetry
of
life
she
has
been
an
inspiration
to
man
guiding
most
often
unconsciously
his
restless
energy
into
an
immense
variety
of
creations
in
literature
art
music
and
religion
this
is
why
in
india
woman
has
been
described
as
the
symbol
of
shakti
the
creative
power
but
if
woman
begins
to
believe
that
though
biologically
her
function
is
different
from
that
of
man
psychologically
she
is
identical
with
him
if
the
human
world
in
its
mentality
becomes
exclusively
male
then
before
long
it
will
be
reduced
to
utter
inanity
for
life
finds
its
truth
and
beauty
not
in
any
exaggeration
of
sameness
but
in
harmony
if
woman
nature
were
identical
with
man
if
eve
were
a
mere
tautology
of
adam
it
would
only
give
rise
to
a
monotonous
superfluity
but
that
she
was
not
so
was
proved
by
the
banishment
she
secured
from
a
paradise
she
had
the
instinctive
wisdom
to
realise
that
it
was
her
mission
to
help
her
mate
in
creating
a
paradise
of
their
own
on
earth
whose
ideal
she
was
to
supply
with
her
life
whose
materials
were
to
be
produced
and
gathered
by
her
comrade
however
it
is
evident
that
an
increasing
number
of
women
in
the
west
are
ready
to
assert
that
their
difference
from
men
is
unimportant
the
reason
for
the
vehement
utterance
of
such
a
paradox
can
not
be
ignored
it
is
a
rebellion
against
a
necessity
which
is
not
equal
for
both
the
partners
love
in
all
forms
has
its
obligations
and
the
love
that
binds
women
to
their
children
binds
them
to
their
homes
but
necessity
is
a
tyrant
making
us
submit
to
injury
and
indignity
allowing
advantage
over
us
to
those
who
are
wholly
or
comparatively
free
from
its
burden
such
has
been
the
case
in
the
social
relationship
between
man
and
woman
along
with
the
difference
inherent
in
their
respective
natures
there
have
grown
up
between
them
inequalities
fostered
by
circumstances
man
is
not
handicapped
by
the
same
biological
and
psychological
responsibilities
as
woman
and
therefore
he
has
the
liberty
to
give
her
the
security
of
home
this
liberty
exacts
payment
when
it
offers
its
boon
because
to
give
or
to
withhold
the
gift
is
within
its
power
it
is
the
unequal
freedom
in
their
mutual
relationships
which
has
made
the
weight
of
life
tragedies
so
painfully
heavy
for
woman
to
bear
some
mitigation
of
her
disadvantage
has
been
effected
by
her
rendering
herself
and
her
home
a
luxury
to
man
she
has
accentuated
those
qualities
in
herself
which
insidiously
impose
their
bondage
over
her
mate
some
by
pandering
to
his
weakness
and
some
by
satisfying
his
higher
nature
till
the
in
our
society
has
grown
abnormal
and
overpowering
there
is
no
actual
objection
to
this
in
itself
for
it
offers
a
stimulus
acting
in
the
depth
of
life
which
leads
to
creative
exuberance
but
a
great
deal
of
it
is
a
forced
growth
of
compulsion
bearing
seeds
of
degradation
in
those
ages
when
men
acknowledged
spiritual
perfection
to
be
their
object
women
were
denounced
as
the
chief
obstacle
in
their
way
the
constant
and
conscious
exercise
of
allurements
which
gave
women
their
power
attacked
the
weak
spots
in
man
nature
and
by
doing
so
added
to
its
weakness
for
all
relationships
tainted
with
repression
of
freedom
must
become
sources
of
degeneracy
to
the
strong
who
impose
such
repression
balance
of
power
however
between
man
and
woman
was
in
a
measure
established
when
home
wielded
a
strong
enough
attraction
to
make
men
accept
its
obligations
but
at
last
the
time
has
come
when
the
material
ambition
of
man
has
assumed
such
colossal
proportions
that
home
is
in
danger
of
losing
its
centre
of
gravity
for
him
and
he
is
receding
farther
and
farther
from
its
orbit
the
arid
zone
in
the
social
life
is
spreading
fast
the
simple
comforts
of
home
made
precious
by
the
touch
of
love
are
giving
way
to
luxuries
that
can
only
have
their
full
extension
in
the
isolation
of
life
hotels
are
being
erected
on
the
ruins
of
homes
productions
are
growing
more
stupendous
than
creations
and
most
men
have
for
the
materials
of
their
happiness
and
recreation
their
dogs
and
horses
their
pipes
guns
and
gambling
clubs
reactions
and
rebellions
not
being
normal
in
their
character
go
on
hurting
truth
until
peace
is
restored
therefore
when
woman
refuses
to
acknowledge
the
distinction
between
her
life
and
that
of
man
she
does
not
convince
us
of
its
truth
but
only
proves
to
us
that
she
is
suffering
all
great
sufferings
indicate
some
wrong
somewhere
in
the
present
case
the
wrong
is
in
woman
lack
of
freedom
in
her
relationship
with
man
which
compels
her
to
turn
her
disabilities
into
attractions
and
to
use
untruths
as
her
allies
in
the
battle
of
life
while
she
is
suffering
from
the
precariousness
of
her
position
from
the
beginning
of
our
society
women
have
naturally
accepted
the
training
which
imparts
to
their
life
and
to
their
home
a
spirit
of
harmony
it
is
their
instinct
to
perform
their
services
in
such
a
manner
that
these
through
beauty
might
be
raised
from
the
domain
of
slavery
to
the
realm
of
grace
women
have
tried
to
prove
that
in
the
building
up
of
social
life
they
are
artists
and
not
artisans
but
all
expressions
of
beauty
lose
their
truth
when
compelled
to
accept
the
patronage
of
the
gross
and
the
indifferent
therefore
when
necessity
drives
women
to
fashion
their
lives
to
the
taste
of
the
insensitive
or
the
sensual
then
the
whole
thing
becomes
a
tragedy
of
desecration
society
is
full
of
such
tragedies
many
of
the
laws
and
social
regulations
guiding
the
relationships
of
man
and
woman
are
relics
of
a
barbaric
age
when
the
brutal
pride
of
an
exclusive
possession
had
its
dominance
in
human
relations
such
as
those
of
parents
and
children
husbands
and
wives
masters
and
servants
teachers
and
disciples
the
vulgarity
of
it
still
persists
in
the
social
bond
between
the
sexes
because
of
the
economic
helplessness
of
woman
nothing
makes
us
so
stupidly
mean
as
the
sense
of
superiority
which
the
power
of
the
purse
confers
upon
us
the
powers
of
muscle
and
of
money
have
opportunities
of
immediate
satisfaction
but
the
power
of
the
ideal
must
have
infinite
patience
the
man
who
sells
his
goods
or
fulfils
his
contract
is
cheated
if
he
fails
to
realise
payment
but
he
who
gives
form
to
some
ideal
may
never
get
his
due
and
be
fully
paid
what
i
have
felt
in
the
women
of
india
is
the
consciousness
of
this
simple
faith
in
the
sanctity
of
devotion
lighted
by
love
which
is
held
to
be
divine
true
womanliness
is
regarded
in
our
country
as
the
saintliness
of
love
it
is
not
merely
praised
there
but
literally
worshipped
and
she
who
is
gifted
with
it
is
called
as
one
revealing
in
herself
woman
the
divine
that
this
has
not
been
a
mere
metaphor
to
us
is
because
in
india
our
mind
is
familiar
with
the
idea
of
god
in
an
eternal
feminine
aspect
thus
the
eastern
woman
who
is
deeply
aware
in
her
heart
of
the
sacredness
of
her
mission
is
a
constant
education
to
man
it
has
to
be
admitted
that
there
are
chances
of
such
an
influence
failing
to
penetrate
the
callousness
of
the
but
that
is
the
destiny
of
all
manifestations
whose
value
is
not
in
success
or
reward
in
honour
woman
has
to
be
ready
to
suffer
she
can
not
allow
her
emotions
to
be
dulled
or
polluted
for
these
are
to
create
her
life
atmosphere
apart
from
which
her
world
would
be
dark
and
dead
this
leaves
her
heart
without
any
protection
of
insensibility
at
the
mercy
of
the
hurts
and
insults
of
life
women
of
india
like
women
everywhere
have
their
share
of
suffering
but
it
radiates
through
the
ideal
and
becomes
like
sunlight
a
creative
force
in
their
world
our
women
know
by
heart
the
legends
of
the
great
women
of
the
epic
who
by
the
power
of
love
conquered
death
and
sitâ
who
had
no
other
reward
for
her
life
of
sacrifice
but
the
sacred
majesty
of
sorrow
they
know
that
it
is
their
duty
to
make
this
life
an
image
of
the
life
eternal
and
that
love
mission
truly
performed
has
a
spiritual
meaning
it
is
a
religious
responsibility
for
them
to
live
the
life
which
is
their
own
for
their
activity
is
not
for
or
organising
power
or
intellectually
probing
the
mystery
of
existence
but
for
establishing
and
maintaining
human
relationships
requiring
the
highest
moral
qualities
it
is
the
consciousness
of
the
spiritual
character
of
their
life
work
which
lifts
them
above
the
utilitarian
standard
of
the
immediate
and
the
passing
surrounds
them
with
the
dignity
of
the
eternal
and
transmutes
their
suffering
and
sorrow
into
a
crown
of
light
i
must
guard
myself
from
the
risk
of
a
possible
misunderstanding
the
permanent
significance
of
home
is
not
in
the
narrowness
of
its
enclosure
but
in
an
eternal
moral
idea
it
represents
the
truth
of
human
relationship
it
reveals
loyalty
and
love
for
the
personality
of
man
let
us
take
a
wider
view
in
a
perspective
truer
than
can
be
found
in
its
present
conventional
associations
with
the
discovery
and
development
of
agriculture
there
came
a
period
of
settled
life
in
our
history
the
nomad
ever
moved
on
with
his
tents
and
cattle
he
explored
space
and
exploited
its
contents
the
cultivator
of
land
explored
time
in
its
immensity
for
he
had
leisure
comparatively
secured
from
the
uncertainty
of
his
outer
resources
he
had
the
opportunity
to
deal
with
his
moral
resources
in
the
realm
of
human
truth
this
is
why
agricultural
civilisation
like
that
of
india
and
china
is
essentially
a
civilisation
of
human
relationship
of
the
adjustment
of
mutual
obligations
it
is
in
the
inner
life
of
man
its
basis
is
and
not
competition
in
other
words
its
principle
is
the
principle
of
home
to
which
all
its
outer
adventures
are
subordinated
in
the
meanwhile
the
nomadic
life
with
its
predatory
instinct
of
exploitation
has
developed
into
a
great
civilisation
it
is
immensely
proud
and
strong
killing
leisure
and
pursuing
opportunities
it
minimises
the
claims
of
personal
relationship
and
is
jealously
careful
of
its
unhampered
freedom
for
acquiring
wealth
and
asserting
its
will
upon
others
its
burden
is
the
burden
of
things
which
grows
heavier
and
more
complex
every
day
disregarding
the
human
and
the
spiritual
its
powerful
pressure
from
all
sides
narrows
the
limits
of
home
the
personal
region
of
the
human
world
thus
in
this
region
of
life
women
are
every
day
hustled
out
of
their
shelter
for
want
of
accommodation
but
such
a
state
of
things
can
never
have
the
effect
of
changing
woman
into
man
on
the
contrary
it
will
lead
her
to
find
her
place
in
the
unlimited
range
of
society
and
the
guardian
spirit
of
the
personal
in
human
nature
will
extend
the
ministry
of
woman
over
all
developments
of
life
habituated
to
deal
with
the
world
as
a
machine
man
is
multiplying
his
materials
banishing
away
his
happiness
and
sacrificing
love
to
comfort
which
is
an
illusion
at
last
the
present
age
has
sent
its
cry
to
woman
asking
her
to
come
out
from
her
segregation
in
order
to
restore
the
spiritual
supremacy
of
all
that
is
human
in
the
world
of
humanity
she
has
been
aroused
to
remember
that
womanliness
is
not
chiefly
decorative
it
is
like
that
vital
health
which
not
only
imparts
the
bloom
of
beauty
to
the
body
but
joy
to
the
mind
and
perfection
to
life
an
eastern
university
in
the
midst
of
much
that
is
discouraging
in
the
present
state
of
the
world
there
is
one
symptom
of
vital
promise
asia
is
awakening
this
great
event
if
it
be
but
directed
along
the
right
lines
is
full
of
hope
not
only
for
asia
herself
but
for
the
whole
world
on
the
other
hand
it
has
to
be
admitted
that
the
relationship
of
the
west
with
the
east
growing
more
and
more
complex
and
widespread
for
over
two
centuries
far
from
attaining
its
true
fulfilment
has
given
rise
to
a
universal
spirit
of
conflict
the
consequent
strain
and
unrest
have
profoundly
disturbed
asia
and
antipathetic
forces
have
been
accumulating
for
years
in
the
depth
of
the
eastern
mind
the
meeting
of
the
east
and
the
west
has
remained
incomplete
because
the
occasions
of
it
have
not
been
disinterested
the
political
and
commercial
adventures
carried
on
by
western
often
by
force
and
against
the
interest
and
wishes
of
the
countries
they
have
dealt
created
a
moral
alienation
which
is
deeply
injurious
to
both
parties
the
perils
threatened
by
this
unnatural
relationship
have
long
been
contemptuously
ignored
by
the
west
but
the
blind
confidence
of
the
strong
in
their
apparent
invincibility
has
often
led
them
from
their
dream
of
security
into
terrible
surprises
of
history
it
is
not
the
fear
of
danger
or
loss
to
one
people
or
another
however
which
is
most
important
the
demoralising
influence
of
the
constant
estrangement
between
the
two
hemispheres
which
affects
the
baser
passions
of
man
greed
and
hypocrisy
on
the
one
hand
fear
suspiciousness
and
flattery
on
the
other
been
developing
and
threatens
us
with
a
spiritual
disaster
the
time
has
come
when
we
must
use
all
our
wisdom
to
understand
the
situation
and
to
control
it
with
a
stronger
trust
in
moral
guidance
than
in
any
array
of
physical
forces
in
the
beginning
of
man
history
his
first
social
object
was
to
form
a
community
to
grow
into
a
people
at
that
early
period
individuals
were
gathered
together
within
geographical
enclosures
but
in
the
present
age
with
its
facility
of
communication
geographical
barriers
have
almost
lost
their
reality
and
the
great
federation
of
men
which
is
waiting
either
to
find
its
true
scope
or
to
break
asunder
in
a
final
catastrophe
is
not
a
meeting
of
individuals
but
of
various
human
races
now
the
problem
before
us
is
of
one
single
country
which
is
this
earth
where
the
races
as
individuals
must
find
both
their
freedom
of
and
their
bond
of
federation
mankind
must
realise
a
unity
wider
in
range
deeper
in
sentiment
stronger
in
power
than
ever
before
now
that
the
problem
is
large
we
have
to
solve
it
on
a
bigger
scale
to
realise
the
god
in
man
by
a
larger
faith
and
to
build
the
temple
of
our
faith
on
a
sure
and
basis
the
first
step
towards
realisation
is
to
create
opportunities
for
revealing
the
different
peoples
to
one
another
this
can
never
be
done
in
those
fields
where
the
exploiting
utilitarian
spirit
is
supreme
we
must
find
some
where
there
can
be
no
question
of
conflicting
interests
one
of
such
places
is
the
university
where
we
can
work
together
in
a
common
pursuit
of
truth
share
together
our
common
heritage
and
realise
that
artists
in
all
parts
of
the
world
have
created
forms
of
beauty
scientists
discovered
secrets
of
the
universe
philosophers
solved
the
problems
of
existence
saints
made
the
truth
of
the
spiritual
world
organic
in
their
own
lives
not
merely
for
some
particular
race
to
which
they
belonged
but
for
all
mankind
when
the
science
of
meteorology
knows
the
earth
atmosphere
as
continuously
one
affecting
the
different
parts
of
the
world
differently
but
in
a
harmony
of
adjustments
it
knows
and
attains
truth
and
so
too
we
must
know
that
the
great
mind
of
man
is
one
working
through
the
many
differences
which
are
needed
to
ensure
the
full
result
of
its
fundamental
unity
when
we
understand
this
truth
in
a
disinterested
spirit
it
teaches
us
to
respect
all
the
differences
in
man
that
are
real
yet
remain
conscious
of
our
oneness
and
to
know
that
perfection
of
unity
is
not
in
uniformity
but
in
harmony
this
is
the
problem
of
the
present
age
the
east
for
its
own
sake
and
for
the
sake
of
the
world
must
not
remain
unrevealed
the
deepest
source
of
all
calamities
in
history
is
misunderstanding
for
where
we
do
not
understand
we
can
never
be
just
being
strongly
impressed
with
the
need
and
the
responsibility
which
every
individual
must
realise
according
to
his
power
i
have
formed
the
nucleus
of
an
international
university
in
india
as
one
of
the
best
means
of
promoting
mutual
understanding
between
the
east
and
the
west
this
institution
according
to
the
plan
i
have
in
mind
will
invite
students
from
the
west
to
study
the
different
systems
of
indian
philosophy
literature
art
and
music
in
their
proper
environment
encouraging
them
to
carry
on
research
work
in
collaboration
with
the
scholars
already
engaged
in
this
task
india
has
her
renaissance
she
is
preparing
to
make
her
contribution
to
the
world
of
the
future
in
the
past
she
produced
her
great
culture
and
in
the
present
age
she
has
an
equally
important
contribution
to
make
to
the
culture
of
the
new
world
which
is
emerging
from
the
wreckage
of
the
old
this
is
a
momentous
period
of
her
history
pregnant
with
precious
possibilities
when
any
disinterested
offer
of
from
any
part
of
the
west
will
have
an
immense
moral
value
the
memory
of
which
will
become
brighter
as
the
regeneration
of
the
east
grows
in
vigour
and
creative
power
the
western
universities
give
their
students
an
opportunity
to
learn
what
all
the
european
peoples
have
contributed
to
their
western
culture
thus
the
intellectual
mind
of
the
west
has
been
luminously
revealed
to
the
world
what
is
needed
to
complete
this
illumination
is
for
the
east
to
collect
its
own
scattered
lamps
and
offer
them
to
the
enlightenment
of
the
world
there
was
a
time
when
the
great
countries
of
asia
had
each
of
them
to
nurture
its
own
civilisation
apart
in
comparative
seclusion
now
has
come
the
age
of
and
the
seedlings
that
were
reared
within
narrow
plots
must
now
be
transplanted
into
the
open
fields
they
must
pass
the
test
of
the
if
their
maximum
value
is
to
be
obtained
but
before
asia
is
in
a
position
to
with
the
culture
of
europe
she
must
base
her
own
structure
on
a
synthesis
of
all
the
different
cultures
which
she
has
when
taking
her
stand
on
such
a
culture
she
turns
toward
the
west
she
will
take
with
a
confident
sense
of
mental
freedom
her
own
view
of
truth
from
her
own
and
open
a
new
vista
of
thought
to
the
world
otherwise
she
will
allow
her
priceless
inheritance
to
crumble
into
dust
and
trying
to
replace
it
clumsily
with
feeble
imitations
of
the
west
make
herself
superfluous
cheap
and
ludicrous
if
she
thus
loses
her
individuality
and
her
specific
power
to
exist
will
it
in
the
least
help
the
rest
of
the
world
will
not
her
terrible
bankruptcy
involve
also
the
western
mind
if
the
whole
world
grows
at
last
into
an
exaggerated
west
then
such
an
illimitable
parody
of
the
modern
age
will
die
crushed
beneath
its
own
absurdity
in
this
belief
it
is
my
desire
to
extend
by
degrees
the
scope
of
this
university
on
simple
lines
until
it
comprehends
the
whole
range
of
eastern
aryan
semitic
mongolian
and
others
its
object
will
be
to
reveal
the
eastern
mind
to
the
world
of
one
thing
i
felt
certain
during
my
travels
in
europe
that
a
genuine
interest
has
been
roused
there
in
the
philosophy
and
the
arts
of
the
east
from
which
the
western
mind
seeks
fresh
inspiration
of
truth
and
beauty
once
the
east
had
her
reputation
of
fabulous
wealth
and
the
seekers
were
attracted
from
across
the
sea
since
then
the
shrine
of
wealth
has
changed
its
site
but
the
east
is
famed
also
for
her
storage
of
wisdom
harvested
by
her
patriarchs
from
long
successive
ages
of
spiritual
endeavour
and
when
as
now
in
the
midst
of
the
pursuit
of
power
and
wealth
there
rises
the
cry
of
privation
from
the
famished
spirit
of
man
an
opportunity
is
offered
to
the
east
to
offer
her
store
to
those
who
need
it
once
upon
a
time
we
were
in
possession
of
such
a
thing
as
our
own
mind
in
india
it
was
living
it
thought
it
felt
it
expressed
itself
it
was
receptive
as
well
as
productive
that
this
mind
could
be
of
any
use
in
the
process
or
in
the
end
of
our
education
was
overlooked
by
our
modern
educational
dispensation
we
are
provided
with
buildings
and
books
and
other
magnificent
burdens
calculated
to
suppress
our
mind
the
latter
was
treated
like
a
solidly
made
of
wood
to
be
loaded
with
volumes
of
information
in
consequence
it
has
lost
its
own
colour
and
character
and
has
borrowed
polish
from
the
carpenter
shop
all
this
has
cost
us
money
and
also
our
finer
ideas
while
our
intellectual
vacancy
has
been
crammed
with
what
is
described
in
official
reports
as
education
in
fact
we
have
bought
our
spectacles
at
the
expense
of
our
eyesight
in
india
our
goddess
of
learning
is
my
audience
in
the
west
i
am
sure
will
be
glad
to
know
that
her
complexion
is
white
but
the
signal
fact
is
that
she
is
living
and
she
is
a
woman
and
her
seat
is
on
a
the
symbolic
meaning
of
this
is
that
she
dwells
in
the
centre
of
life
and
the
heart
of
all
existence
which
opens
itself
in
beauty
to
the
light
of
heaven
the
western
education
which
we
have
chanced
to
know
is
impersonal
its
complexion
is
also
white
but
it
is
the
whiteness
of
the
walls
it
dwells
in
the
compartments
of
lessons
and
the
minds
of
the
schoolmasters
the
effect
which
it
had
on
my
mind
when
as
a
boy
i
was
compelled
to
go
to
school
i
have
described
elsewhere
my
feeling
was
very
much
the
same
as
a
tree
might
have
which
was
not
allowed
to
live
its
full
life
but
was
cut
down
to
be
made
into
the
introduction
of
this
education
was
not
a
part
of
the
solemn
marriage
ceremony
which
was
to
unite
the
minds
of
the
east
and
west
in
mutual
understanding
it
represented
an
artificial
method
of
training
specially
calculated
to
produce
the
carriers
of
the
white
burden
this
want
of
ideals
still
clings
to
our
education
system
though
our
universities
have
latterly
burdened
their
syllabus
with
a
greater
number
of
subjects
than
before
but
it
is
only
like
adding
to
the
bags
of
wheat
the
bullock
carries
to
market
it
does
not
make
the
bullock
any
better
off
mind
when
long
deprived
of
its
natural
food
of
truth
and
freedom
of
growth
develops
an
unnatural
craving
for
success
and
our
students
have
fallen
victims
to
the
mania
for
success
in
examinations
success
consists
in
obtaining
the
largest
number
of
marks
with
the
strictest
economy
of
knowledge
it
is
a
deliberate
cultivation
of
disloyalty
to
truth
of
intellectual
dishonesty
of
a
foolish
imposition
by
which
the
mind
is
encouraged
to
rob
itself
but
as
we
are
by
means
of
it
made
to
forget
the
existence
of
mind
we
are
supremely
happy
at
the
result
we
pass
examinations
and
shrivel
up
into
clerks
lawyers
and
police
inspectors
and
we
die
young
universities
should
never
be
made
into
mechanical
organisations
for
collecting
and
distributing
knowledge
through
them
the
people
should
offer
their
intellectual
hospitality
their
wealth
of
mind
to
others
and
earn
their
proud
right
in
return
to
receive
gifts
from
the
rest
of
the
world
but
in
the
whole
length
and
breadth
of
india
there
is
not
a
single
university
established
in
the
modern
time
where
a
foreign
or
an
indian
student
can
properly
be
acquainted
with
the
best
products
of
the
indian
mind
for
that
we
have
to
cross
the
sea
and
knock
at
the
doors
of
france
and
germany
educational
institutions
in
our
country
are
india
of
knowledge
they
lower
our
intellectual
they
encourage
us
to
make
a
foolish
display
of
decorations
composed
of
borrowed
feathers
this
it
was
that
led
me
to
found
a
school
in
bengal
in
face
of
many
difficulties
and
discouragements
and
in
spite
of
my
own
vocation
as
a
poet
who
finds
his
true
inspiration
only
when
he
forgets
that
he
is
a
schoolmaster
it
is
my
hope
that
in
this
school
a
nucleus
has
been
formed
round
which
an
indigenous
university
of
our
own
land
will
find
its
natural
university
which
will
help
india
mind
to
concentrate
and
to
be
fully
conscious
of
itself
free
to
seek
the
truth
and
make
this
truth
its
own
wherever
found
to
judge
by
its
own
standard
give
expression
to
its
own
creative
genius
and
offer
its
wisdom
to
the
guests
who
come
from
other
parts
of
the
world
man
intellect
has
a
natural
pride
in
its
own
aristocracy
which
is
the
pride
of
its
culture
culture
only
acknowledges
the
excellence
whose
criticism
is
in
its
inner
perfection
not
in
any
external
success
when
this
pride
succumbs
to
some
compulsion
of
necessity
or
lure
of
material
advantage
it
brings
humiliation
to
the
intellectual
man
modern
india
through
her
very
education
has
been
made
to
suffer
this
humiliation
once
she
herself
provided
her
children
with
a
culture
which
was
the
product
of
her
own
ages
of
thought
and
creation
but
it
has
been
thrust
aside
and
we
are
made
to
tread
the
mill
of
passing
examinations
not
for
learning
anything
but
for
notifying
that
we
are
qualified
for
employments
under
organisations
conducted
in
english
our
educated
community
is
not
a
cultured
community
but
a
community
of
qualified
candidates
meanwhile
the
proportion
of
possible
employments
to
the
number
of
claimants
has
gradually
been
growing
narrower
and
the
consequent
disaffection
has
been
widespread
at
last
the
very
authorities
who
are
responsible
for
this
are
blaming
their
victims
such
is
the
perversity
of
human
nature
it
bears
its
worst
grudge
against
those
it
has
injured
it
is
as
if
some
tribe
which
had
the
primitive
habit
of
decorating
its
tribal
members
with
birds
plumage
were
some
day
to
hold
these
very
birds
guilty
of
the
crime
of
being
extinct
there
are
belated
attempts
on
the
part
of
our
governors
to
read
us
pious
homilies
about
disinterested
love
of
learning
while
the
old
machinery
goes
on
working
whose
product
is
not
education
but
certificates
it
is
good
to
remind
the
fettered
bird
that
its
wings
are
for
soaring
but
it
is
better
to
cut
the
chain
which
is
holding
it
to
its
perch
the
most
pathetic
feature
of
the
tragedy
is
that
the
bird
itself
has
learnt
to
use
its
chain
for
its
ornament
simply
because
the
chain
jingles
in
fairly
respectable
english
in
the
bengali
language
there
is
a
modern
maxim
which
can
be
translated
he
who
learns
to
read
and
write
rides
in
a
carriage
and
pair
in
english
there
is
a
similar
proverb
knowledge
is
power
it
is
an
offer
of
a
prospective
bribe
to
the
student
a
promise
of
an
ulterior
reward
which
is
more
important
than
knowledge
itself
temptations
held
before
us
as
inducements
to
be
good
or
to
pursue
uncongenial
paths
are
most
often
flimsy
lies
or
such
as
the
maxim
of
respectable
piety
honesty
is
the
best
policy
at
which
politicians
all
over
the
world
seem
to
laugh
in
their
sleeves
but
unfortunately
education
conducted
under
a
special
providence
of
purposefulness
of
eating
the
fruit
of
knowledge
from
the
wrong
end
lead
one
to
that
special
paradise
on
earth
the
daily
rides
in
one
own
carriage
and
pair
and
the
west
i
have
heard
from
authentic
sources
is
aspiring
in
its
education
after
that
special
cultivation
of
worldliness
where
society
is
comparatively
simple
and
obstructions
are
not
too
numerous
we
can
clearly
see
how
the
guides
education
in
its
vital
purpose
the
system
of
which
is
indigenous
to
india
but
is
dying
out
was
one
with
the
people
life
it
flowed
naturally
through
the
social
channels
and
made
its
way
everywhere
it
is
a
system
of
widespread
irrigation
of
culture
its
teachers
specially
trained
men
are
in
constant
requisition
and
find
crowded
meetings
in
our
villages
where
they
repeat
the
best
thoughts
and
express
the
ideals
of
the
land
in
the
most
effective
form
the
mode
of
instruction
includes
the
recitation
of
epics
expounding
of
the
scriptures
reading
from
the
puranas
which
are
the
classical
records
of
old
history
performance
of
plays
founded
upon
the
early
myths
and
legends
dramatic
narration
of
the
lives
of
ancient
heroes
and
the
singing
in
chorus
of
songs
from
the
old
religious
literature
evidently
according
to
this
system
the
best
function
of
education
is
to
enable
us
to
realise
that
to
live
as
a
man
is
great
requiring
profound
philosophy
for
its
ideal
poetry
for
its
expression
and
heroism
in
its
conduct
owing
to
this
vital
method
of
culture
the
common
people
of
india
though
technically
illiterate
have
been
made
conscious
of
the
sanctity
of
social
relationships
entailing
constant
sacrifice
and
urged
and
supported
by
ideals
collectively
expressed
in
one
word
such
a
system
of
education
may
sound
too
simple
for
the
complexities
of
modern
life
but
the
fundamental
principle
of
social
life
in
its
different
stages
of
development
remains
the
same
and
in
no
circumstance
can
the
truth
be
ignored
that
all
human
complexities
must
harmonise
in
organic
unity
with
life
failing
which
there
will
be
endless
conflict
most
things
in
the
civilised
world
occupy
more
than
their
legitimate
space
much
of
their
burden
is
needless
by
bearing
this
burden
civilised
man
may
be
showing
great
strength
but
he
displays
little
skill
to
the
gods
viewing
this
from
on
high
it
must
seem
like
the
flounderings
of
a
giant
who
has
got
out
of
his
depth
and
knows
not
how
to
swim
the
main
source
of
all
forms
of
voluntary
slavery
is
the
desire
of
gain
it
is
difficult
to
fight
against
this
when
modern
civilisation
is
tainted
with
such
a
universal
contamination
of
avarice
i
have
realised
it
myself
in
the
little
boys
of
my
own
school
for
the
first
few
years
there
is
no
trouble
but
as
soon
as
the
upper
class
is
reached
their
worldly
malady
of
the
to
assert
itself
they
rebelliously
insist
that
they
must
no
longer
learn
but
rather
pass
examinations
professions
in
the
modern
age
are
more
numerous
and
lucrative
than
ever
before
they
need
specialisation
of
training
and
knowledge
tempting
education
to
yield
its
spiritual
freedom
to
the
claims
of
utilitarian
ambitions
but
man
deeper
nature
is
hurt
his
smothered
life
seeks
to
be
liberated
from
the
suffocating
folds
and
sensual
ties
of
prosperity
and
this
is
why
we
find
almost
everywhere
in
the
world
a
growing
dissatisfaction
with
the
prevalent
system
of
teaching
which
betrays
the
encroachment
of
senility
and
worldly
prudence
over
pure
intellect
in
india
also
a
vague
feeling
of
discontent
has
given
rise
to
numerous
attempts
at
establishing
national
schools
and
colleges
but
unfortunately
our
very
education
has
been
successful
in
depriving
us
of
our
real
initiative
and
our
courage
of
thought
the
training
we
get
in
our
schools
has
the
constant
implication
in
it
that
it
is
not
for
us
to
produce
but
to
borrow
and
we
are
casting
about
to
borrow
our
educational
plans
from
european
institutions
the
trampled
plants
of
indian
corn
are
dreaming
of
recouping
their
harvest
from
the
neighbouring
wheat
fields
to
change
the
figure
we
forget
that
for
proficiency
in
walking
it
is
better
to
train
the
muscles
of
our
own
legs
than
to
strut
upon
wooden
ones
of
foreign
make
although
they
clatter
and
cause
more
surprise
at
our
skill
in
using
them
than
if
they
were
living
and
real
but
when
we
go
to
borrow
help
from
a
foreign
neighbourhood
we
are
apt
to
overlook
the
real
source
of
help
behind
all
that
is
external
and
apparent
had
the
fishes
happened
to
produce
a
scientist
who
chose
the
jumping
of
a
monkey
for
his
research
work
i
am
sure
he
would
give
most
of
the
credit
to
the
branches
of
the
trees
and
very
little
to
the
monkey
itself
in
a
foreign
university
we
see
the
branching
wildernesses
of
its
buildings
furniture
regulations
and
syllabus
but
the
monkey
which
is
a
difficult
creature
to
catch
and
more
difficult
to
manufacture
we
are
likely
to
treat
as
a
mere
accident
of
minor
importance
it
is
convenient
for
us
to
overlook
the
fact
that
among
the
europeans
the
living
spirit
of
the
university
is
widely
spread
in
their
society
their
parliament
their
literature
and
the
numerous
activities
of
their
corporate
life
in
all
these
functions
they
are
in
perpetual
touch
with
the
great
personality
of
the
land
which
is
creative
and
heroic
in
its
constant
acts
of
and
they
have
their
thoughts
published
in
their
books
as
well
as
through
the
medium
of
living
men
who
think
those
thoughts
and
who
criticise
compare
and
disseminate
them
some
at
least
of
the
drawbacks
of
their
academic
education
are
redeemed
by
the
living
energy
of
the
intellectual
personality
pervading
their
social
organism
it
is
like
the
stagnant
reservoir
of
water
which
finds
its
purification
in
the
showers
of
rain
to
which
it
keeps
itself
open
but
to
our
misfortune
we
have
in
india
all
the
furniture
of
the
european
university
except
the
human
teacher
we
have
instead
mere
purveyors
of
in
whom
the
paper
god
of
the
bookshop
has
been
made
vocal
a
most
important
truth
which
we
are
apt
to
forget
is
that
a
teacher
can
never
truly
teach
unless
he
is
still
learning
himself
a
lamp
can
never
light
another
lamp
unless
it
continues
to
burn
its
own
flame
the
teacher
who
has
come
to
the
end
of
his
subject
who
has
no
living
traffic
with
his
knowledge
but
merely
repeats
his
lessons
to
his
students
can
only
load
their
minds
he
can
not
quicken
them
truth
not
only
must
inform
but
inspire
if
the
inspiration
dies
out
and
the
information
only
accumulates
then
truth
loses
its
infinity
the
greater
part
of
our
learning
in
the
schools
has
been
wasted
because
for
most
of
our
teachers
their
subjects
are
like
dead
specimens
of
once
living
things
with
which
they
have
a
learned
acquaintance
but
no
communication
of
life
and
love
the
educational
institution
therefore
which
i
have
in
mind
has
primarily
for
its
object
the
constant
pursuit
of
truth
from
which
the
imparting
of
truth
naturally
follows
it
must
not
be
a
dead
cage
in
which
living
minds
are
fed
with
food
artificially
prepared
it
should
be
an
open
house
in
which
students
and
teachers
are
at
one
they
must
live
their
complete
life
together
dominated
by
a
common
aspiration
for
truth
and
a
need
of
sharing
all
the
delights
of
culture
in
former
days
the
great
had
students
in
their
workshops
where
they
in
shaping
things
to
perfection
that
was
the
place
where
knowledge
could
become
knowledge
which
not
only
has
its
substance
and
law
but
its
atmosphere
subtly
informed
by
a
creative
personality
for
intellectual
knowledge
also
has
its
aspect
of
creative
art
in
which
the
man
who
explores
truth
expresses
something
which
is
human
in
enthusiasm
his
courage
his
sacrifice
his
honesty
and
his
skill
in
merely
academical
teaching
we
find
subjects
but
not
the
man
who
pursues
the
subjects
therefore
the
vital
part
of
education
remains
incomplete
for
our
universities
we
must
claim
not
labelled
packages
of
truth
and
authorised
agents
to
distribute
them
but
truth
in
its
living
association
with
her
lovers
and
seekers
and
discoverers
also
we
must
know
that
the
concentration
of
the
scattered
throughout
the
country
is
the
most
important
mission
of
a
university
which
like
the
nucleus
of
a
living
cell
should
be
the
centre
of
the
intellectual
life
of
the
people
the
bringing
about
of
an
intellectual
unity
in
india
is
i
am
told
difficult
to
the
verge
of
impossibility
owing
to
the
fact
that
india
has
so
many
different
languages
such
a
statement
is
as
unreasonable
as
to
say
that
man
because
he
has
a
diversity
of
limbs
should
find
it
impossible
to
realise
life
unity
in
himself
and
that
only
an
earthworm
composed
of
a
tail
and
nothing
else
could
truly
know
that
it
had
a
body
let
us
admit
that
india
is
not
like
any
one
of
the
great
countries
of
europe
which
has
its
own
separate
language
but
is
rather
like
europe
herself
branching
out
into
different
peoples
with
many
different
languages
and
yet
europe
has
a
common
civilisation
with
an
intellectual
unity
which
is
not
based
upon
uniformity
of
language
it
is
true
that
in
the
earlier
stages
of
her
culture
the
whole
of
europe
had
latin
for
her
learned
tongue
that
was
in
her
intellectual
budding
time
when
all
her
petals
of
were
closed
in
one
point
but
the
perfection
of
her
mental
unfolding
was
not
represented
by
the
singularity
of
her
literary
vehicle
when
the
great
european
countries
found
their
individual
languages
then
only
the
true
federation
of
cultures
became
possible
in
the
west
and
the
very
differences
of
the
channels
made
the
commerce
of
ideas
in
europe
so
richly
copious
and
so
variedly
active
we
can
well
imagine
what
the
loss
to
european
civilisation
would
be
if
france
italy
and
germany
and
england
herself
had
not
through
their
separate
agencies
contributed
to
the
common
coffer
their
individual
earnings
there
was
a
time
with
us
when
india
had
her
common
language
of
culture
in
sanskrit
but
for
the
complete
commerce
of
her
thought
she
required
that
all
her
vernaculars
should
attain
their
perfect
powers
through
which
her
different
peoples
might
manifest
their
idiosyncrasies
and
this
could
never
be
done
through
a
foreign
tongue
in
the
united
states
in
canada
and
other
british
colonies
the
language
of
the
people
is
english
it
has
a
great
literature
which
had
its
birth
and
growth
in
the
history
of
the
british
islands
but
when
this
language
with
all
its
products
and
acquisitions
matured
by
ages
on
its
own
mother
soil
is
carried
into
foreign
lands
which
have
their
own
separate
history
and
their
own
it
must
constantly
hamper
the
indigenous
growth
of
culture
and
destroy
individuality
of
judgement
and
the
perfect
freedom
of
the
inherited
wealth
of
the
english
language
with
all
its
splendour
becomes
an
impediment
when
taken
into
different
surroundings
just
as
when
lungs
are
given
to
the
whale
in
the
sea
if
such
is
the
case
even
with
races
whose
naturally
continues
to
be
their
own
one
can
imagine
what
sterility
it
means
for
a
people
which
accepts
for
its
vehicle
of
culture
an
altogether
foreign
language
a
language
is
not
like
an
umbrella
or
an
overcoat
that
can
be
borrowed
by
unconscious
or
deliberate
mistake
it
is
like
the
living
skin
itself
if
the
body
of
a
enters
into
the
skin
of
a
it
will
be
safe
to
wager
that
such
an
anomaly
will
never
win
a
race
and
will
fail
even
to
drag
a
cart
have
we
not
watched
some
modern
japanese
artists
imitating
european
art
the
imitation
may
sometimes
produce
clever
results
but
such
cleverness
has
only
the
perfection
of
artificial
flowers
which
never
bear
fruit
all
great
countries
have
their
vital
centres
for
intellectual
life
where
a
high
standard
of
learning
is
maintained
where
the
minds
of
the
people
are
naturally
attracted
where
they
find
their
genial
atmosphere
in
which
to
prove
their
worth
and
to
contribute
their
share
to
the
country
culture
thus
they
kindle
on
the
common
altar
of
the
land
that
great
sacrificial
fire
which
can
radiate
the
sacred
light
of
wisdom
abroad
athens
was
such
a
centre
in
greece
rome
in
italy
and
paris
is
such
in
france
benares
has
been
and
still
continues
to
be
the
centre
of
our
sanskrit
culture
but
sanskrit
learning
does
not
exhaust
all
the
elements
of
culture
that
exist
in
modern
india
if
we
were
to
take
for
granted
what
some
people
maintain
that
western
culture
is
the
only
source
of
light
for
our
mind
then
it
would
be
like
depending
for
daybreak
upon
some
star
which
is
the
sun
of
a
far
distant
sphere
the
star
may
give
us
light
but
not
the
day
it
may
give
us
direction
in
our
voyage
of
exploration
but
it
can
never
open
the
full
view
of
truth
before
our
eyes
in
fact
we
can
never
use
this
cold
starlight
for
stirring
the
sap
in
our
branches
and
giving
colour
and
bloom
to
our
life
this
is
the
reason
why
european
education
has
become
for
india
mere
school
lessons
and
no
culture
a
box
of
matches
good
for
the
small
uses
of
illumination
but
not
the
light
of
morning
in
which
the
use
and
beauty
and
all
the
subtle
mysteries
of
life
are
blended
in
one
let
me
say
clearly
that
i
have
no
distrust
of
any
culture
because
of
its
foreign
character
on
the
contrary
i
believe
that
the
shock
of
such
extraneous
forces
is
necessary
for
the
vitality
of
our
intellectual
nature
it
is
admitted
that
much
of
the
spirit
of
christianity
runs
counter
not
only
to
the
classical
culture
of
europe
but
to
the
european
temperament
altogether
and
yet
this
alien
movement
of
ideas
constantly
running
against
the
natural
mental
current
of
europe
has
been
a
most
important
factor
in
strengthening
and
enriching
her
civilisation
on
account
of
the
sharp
antagonism
of
its
intellectual
direction
in
fact
the
european
vernaculars
first
woke
up
to
life
and
fruitful
vigour
when
they
felt
the
impact
of
this
foreign
with
all
its
oriental
forms
and
affinities
the
same
thing
is
happening
in
india
the
european
culture
has
come
to
us
not
only
with
its
knowledge
but
with
its
velocity
then
again
let
us
admit
that
modern
science
is
europe
great
gift
to
humanity
for
all
time
to
come
we
in
india
must
claim
it
from
her
hands
and
gratefully
accept
it
in
order
to
be
saved
from
the
curse
of
futility
by
lagging
behind
we
shall
fail
to
reap
the
harvest
of
the
present
age
if
we
delay
what
i
object
to
is
the
artificial
arrangement
by
which
foreign
education
tends
to
occupy
all
the
space
of
our
national
mind
and
thus
kills
or
hampers
the
great
opportunity
for
the
creation
of
a
new
by
a
new
combination
of
truths
it
is
this
which
makes
me
urge
that
all
the
elements
in
our
own
culture
have
to
be
strengthened
not
to
resist
the
western
culture
but
truly
to
accept
and
assimilate
it
to
use
it
for
our
sustenance
not
as
our
burden
to
get
mastery
over
this
culture
and
not
to
live
on
its
outskirts
as
the
hewers
of
texts
and
drawers
of
the
main
river
in
indian
culture
has
flowed
in
four
streams
vedic
the
puranic
the
buddhist
and
the
jain
it
has
its
source
in
the
heights
of
the
indian
consciousness
but
a
river
belonging
to
a
country
is
not
fed
by
its
own
waters
alone
the
tibetan
brahmaputra
is
a
tributary
to
the
indian
ganges
contributions
have
similarly
found
their
way
to
india
original
culture
the
muhammadan
for
example
has
repeatedly
come
into
india
from
outside
laden
with
his
own
stores
of
knowledge
and
feeling
and
his
wonderful
religious
democracy
bringing
freshet
after
freshet
to
swell
the
current
to
our
music
our
architecture
our
pictorial
art
our
literature
the
muhammadans
have
made
their
permanent
and
precious
contribution
those
who
have
studied
the
lives
and
writings
of
our
medieval
saints
and
all
the
great
religious
movements
that
sprang
up
in
the
time
of
the
muhammadan
rule
know
how
deep
is
our
debt
to
this
foreign
current
that
has
so
intimately
mingled
with
our
life
so
in
our
centre
of
indian
learning
we
must
provide
for
the
study
of
all
these
different
cultures
vedic
the
puranic
the
buddhist
the
jain
the
islamic
the
sikh
and
the
zoroastrian
the
chinese
japanese
and
tibetan
will
also
have
to
be
added
for
in
the
past
india
did
not
remain
isolated
within
her
own
boundaries
therefore
in
order
to
learn
what
she
was
in
her
relation
to
the
whole
continent
of
asia
these
cultures
too
must
be
studied
side
by
side
with
them
must
finally
be
placed
the
western
culture
for
only
then
shall
we
be
able
to
assimilate
this
last
contribution
to
our
common
stock
a
river
flowing
within
banks
is
truly
our
own
and
it
can
contain
its
due
tributaries
but
our
relations
with
a
flood
can
only
prove
disastrous
there
are
some
who
are
exclusively
modern
who
believe
that
the
past
is
the
bankrupt
time
leaving
no
assets
for
us
but
only
a
legacy
of
debts
they
refuse
to
believe
that
the
army
which
is
marching
forward
can
be
fed
from
the
rear
it
is
well
to
remind
such
persons
that
the
great
ages
of
renaissance
in
history
were
those
when
man
suddenly
discovered
the
seeds
of
thought
in
the
granary
of
the
past
the
unfortunate
people
who
have
lost
the
harvest
of
their
past
have
lost
their
present
age
they
have
missed
their
seed
for
cultivation
and
go
begging
for
their
bare
livelihood
we
must
not
imagine
that
we
are
one
of
these
disinherited
peoples
of
the
world
the
time
has
come
for
us
to
break
open
the
of
our
ancestors
and
use
it
for
our
commerce
of
life
let
us
with
its
help
make
our
future
our
own
and
not
continue
our
existence
as
the
eternal
in
other
people
dustbins
so
far
i
have
dwelt
only
upon
the
intellectual
aspect
of
education
for
even
in
the
west
it
is
the
intellectual
training
which
receives
almost
exclusive
emphasis
the
western
universities
have
not
yet
truly
recognised
that
fulness
of
expression
is
fulness
of
life
and
a
large
part
of
man
can
never
find
its
expression
in
the
mere
language
of
words
it
must
therefore
seek
for
its
other
languages
and
colours
sounds
and
movements
through
our
mastery
of
these
we
not
only
make
our
whole
nature
articulate
but
also
understand
man
in
all
his
attempts
to
reveal
his
innermost
being
in
every
age
and
clime
the
great
use
of
education
is
not
merely
to
collect
facts
but
to
know
man
and
to
make
oneself
known
to
man
it
is
the
duty
of
every
human
being
to
master
at
least
to
some
extent
not
only
the
language
of
intellect
but
also
that
personality
which
is
the
language
of
art
it
is
a
great
world
of
reality
for
man
and
profound
growing
world
of
his
own
creative
nature
this
is
the
world
of
art
to
be
brought
up
in
ignorance
of
it
is
to
be
deprived
of
the
knowledge
and
use
of
that
great
inheritance
of
humanity
which
has
been
growing
and
waiting
for
every
one
of
us
from
the
beginning
of
our
history
it
is
to
remain
deaf
to
the
eternal
voice
of
man
that
speaks
to
all
men
the
messages
that
are
beyond
speech
from
the
educational
point
of
view
we
know
europe
where
it
is
scientific
or
at
best
literary
so
our
notion
of
its
modern
culture
is
limited
within
the
boundary
lines
of
grammar
and
the
laboratory
we
almost
completely
ignore
the
æsthetic
life
of
man
leaving
it
uncultivated
allowing
weeds
to
grow
there
our
newspapers
are
prolific
our
are
vociferous
and
in
them
we
wear
to
shreds
the
things
we
have
borrowed
from
our
english
teachers
we
make
the
air
dismal
and
damp
with
the
tears
of
our
grievances
but
where
are
our
arts
which
like
the
outbreak
of
spring
flowers
are
the
spontaneous
overflow
of
our
deeper
nature
and
spiritual
magnificence
through
this
great
deficiency
of
our
modern
education
we
are
condemned
to
carry
to
the
end
a
dead
load
of
dumb
wisdom
like
miserable
outcasts
we
are
deprived
of
our
place
in

and

at
the
outer
court
where
the
colours
are
not
for
us
nor
the
forms
of
delight
nor
the
songs
ours
is
the
education
of
a
with
hard
labour
and
with
a
drab
dress
cut
to
the
limits
of
minimum
decency
and
necessity
we
are
made
to
forget
that
the
perfection
of
colour
and
form
and
expression
belongs
to
the
perfection
of
vitality
the
joy
of
life
is
only
the
other
side
of
the
strength
of
life
the
timber
merchant
may
think
that
the
flowers
and
foliage
are
mere
frivolous
decorations
of
a
tree
but
if
these
are
suppressed
he
will
know
to
his
cost
that
the
timber
too
will
fail
during
the
moghal
period
music
and
art
in
india
found
a
great
impetus
from
the
rulers
because
their
whole
merely
their
official
lived
in
this
land
and
it
is
the
wholeness
of
life
from
which
originates
art
but
our
english
teachers
are
birds
of
passage
they
cackle
to
us
but
do
not
sing
true
heart
is
not
in
the
land
of
their
exile
constriction
of
life
owing
to
this
narrowness
of
culture
must
no
longer
be
encouraged
in
the
centre
of
indian
culture
which
i
am
proposing
music
and
art
must
have
their
prominent
seats
of
honour
and
not
be
given
merely
a
tolerant
nod
of
recognition
the
different
systems
of
music
and
different
schools
of
art
which
lie
scattered
in
the
different
ages
and
provinces
of
india
and
in
the
different
strata
of
society
and
also
those
belonging
to
the
other
great
countries
of
asia
which
had
communication
with
india
have
to
be
brought
there
together
and
studied
i
have
already
hinted
that
education
should
not
be
dragged
out
of
its
native
element
the
of
the
people
economic
life
covers
the
whole
width
of
the
fundamental
basis
of
society
because
its
necessities
are
the
simplest
and
the
most
universal
educational
institutions
in
order
to
obtain
their
fulness
of
truth
must
have
close
association
with
this
economic
life
the
highest
mission
of
education
is
to
help
us
to
realise
the
inner
principle
of
the
unity
of
all
knowledge
and
all
the
activities
of
our
social
and
spiritual
being
society
in
its
early
stage
was
held
together
by
its
economic
when
all
its
members
felt
in
unison
a
natural
interest
in
their
right
to
live
civilisation
could
never
have
been
started
at
all
if
such
was
not
the
case
and
civilisation
will
fall
to
pieces
if
it
never
again
realises
the
spirit
of
mutual
help
and
the
common
sharing
of
benefits
in
the
elemental
necessaries
of
life
the
idea
of
such
economic
should
be
made
the
basis
of
our
university
it
must
not
only
instruct
but
live
not
only
think
but
produce
our
ancient
or
forest
schools
which
were
our
natural
universities
were
not
shut
off
from
the
daily
life
of
the
people
masters
and
students
gathered
fruit
and
fuel
and
took
their
cattle
out
to
graze
supporting
themselves
by
the
work
of
their
own
hands
spiritual
education
was
a
part
of
the
spiritual
life
itself
which
comprehended
all
life
our
centre
of
culture
should
not
only
be
the
centre
of
the
intellectual
life
of
india
but
the
centre
of
her
economic
life
also
it
must
with
the
villages
round
it
cultivate
land
breed
cattle
spin
cloths
press
oil
from
it
must
produce
all
the
necessaries
devising
the
best
means
using
the
best
materials
and
calling
science
to
its
aid
its
very
existence
should
depend
upon
the
success
of
its
industrial
activities
carried
out
on
the
principle
which
will
unite
the
teachers
and
students
and
villagers
of
the
neighbourhood
in
a
living
and
active
bond
of
necessity
this
will
give
us
also
a
practical
industrial
training
whose
motive
force
is
not
the
greed
of
profit
before
i
conclude
my
paper
a
delicate
question
remains
to
be
considered
what
must
be
the
religious
ideal
that
is
to
rule
our
centre
of
indian
culture
the
one
abiding
ideal
in
the
religious
life
of
india
has
been
the
deliverance
of
man
soul
from
the
grip
of
self
its
communion
with
the
infinite
soul
through
its
union
in
with
the
universe
this
religion
of
spiritual
harmony
is
not
a
theological
doctrine
to
be
taught
as
a
subject
in
the
class
for
half
an
hour
each
day
it
is
the
spiritual
truth
and
beauty
of
our
attitude
towards
our
surroundings
our
conscious
relationship
with
the
infinite
and
the
lasting
power
of
the
eternal
in
the
passing
moments
of
our
life
such
a
religious
ideal
can
only
be
made
possible
by
making
provision
for
students
to
live
in
intimate
touch
with
nature
daily
to
grow
in
an
atmosphere
of
service
offered
to
all
creatures
tending
trees
feeding
birds
and
animals
learning
to
feel
the
immense
mystery
of
the
soil
and
water
and
air
along
with
this
there
should
be
some
common
sharing
of
life
with
the
tillers
of
the
soil
and
the
humble
workers
in
the
neighbouring
villages
studying
their
crafts
inviting
them
to
the
feasts
joining
them
in
works
of
for
communal
welfare
and
in
our
intercourse
we
should
be
guided
not
by
moral
maxims
or
the
condescension
of
social
superiority
but
by
natural
sympathy
of
life
for
life
and
by
the
sheer
necessity
of
love
sacrifice
for
its
own
sake
in
such
an
atmosphere
students
would
learn
to
understand
that
humanity
is
a
divine
harp
of
many
strings
waiting
for
its
one
grand
music
those
who
realise
this
unity
are
made
ready
for
the
pilgrimage
through
the
night
of
suffering
and
along
the
path
of
sacrifice
to
the
great
meeting
of
man
in
the
future
for
which
the
call
comes
to
us
across
the
darkness
life
in
such
a
centre
should
be
simple
and
clean
we
should
never
believe
that
simplicity
of
life
might
make
us
unsuited
to
the
requirements
of
the
society
of
our
time
it
is
the
simplicity
of
the
which
is
needed
all
the
more
because
of
the
intricacy
of
strings
in
the
instrument
in
the
morning
of
our
career
our
nature
needs
the
pure
and
the
perfect
note
of
a
spiritual
ideal
in
order
to
fit
us
for
the
complications
of
our
later
years
in
other
words
this
institution
should
be
a
perpetual
creation
by
the
enthusiasm
of
teachers
and
students
growing
with
the
growth
of
their
soul
a
world

itself

rich
with
life
radiating

across
space

time
attracting

maintaining
round
it

is
