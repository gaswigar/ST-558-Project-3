preface
this
book
consists
of
two
parts
a
history
and
a
guide
the
history
attempts
after
the
fashion
of
a
pageant
to
marshal
the
activities
of
alexandria
during
the
two
thousand
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
of
her
existence
starting
with
the
heroic
figure
of
alexander
the
great
it
inspects
the
dynasty
of
the
ptolemies
and
in
particular
the
career
of
the
last
of
them
cleopatra
an
account
of
ptolemaic
literature
and
science
follows
and
closes
this
splendid
period
to
which
i
have
given
the
title
of
the
second
period
called
christian
begins
with
the
rule
of
rome
and
traces
the
fortunes
of
christianity
first
as
a
persecuted
and
then
as
a
persecuting
power
all
is
lost
in
when
the
patriarch
cyrus
betrays
alexandria
to
the
arabs
an
interlude
comes
the
spiritual
city
meditates
upon
alexandrian
philosophy
and
religion
both
pagan
and
christian
it
seemed
better
to
segregate
these
subjects
partly
because
they
interrupt
the
main
historical
procession
partly
because
many
readers
are
not
interested
in
them
history
is
resumed
in
the
arab
period
which
is
of
no
importance
though
it
lasts
over
amr
to
napoleon
with
napoleon
begins
the
modern
period
the
main
feature
of
which
is
the
building
of
the
city
we
now
see
under
the
auspices
of
mohammed
ali
and
the
pageant
concludes
as
well
as
it
may
with
an
account
of
the
events
of
and
with
surmises
as
to
future
municipal
developments
the
history
is
written
in
short
sections
and
at
the
end
of
each
section
are
references
to
the
second
guide
these
references
the
chief
utility
of
the
book
so
the
reader
is
begged
to
take
special
note
of
them
they
may
help
him
to
link
the
present
and
the
past
suppose
for
instance
he
has
read
in
the
history
about
the
pharos
at
the
end
of
the
section
he
will
find
references
to
fort
kait
bey
where
the
pharos
stood
to
abousir
where
there
is
a
miniature
replica
of
it
and
to
the
coin
room
in
the
museum
where
it
appears
on
the
moneys
of
domitian
and
hadrian
or
again
suppose
that
the
tragic
fate
of
hypatia
has
touched
him
at
the
end
will
be
references
to
the
caesareum
where
hypatia
was
murdered
and
to
the
wady
natrun
where
the
monks
who
murdered
her
generally
resided
or
the
british
victories
of
he
will
be
referred
to
the
country
over
which
our
troops
marched
to
the
abercrombie
monument
at
sidi
gaber
and
to
a
tombstone
in
the
courtyard
of
the
greek
patriarchate
the
sights
of
alexandria
are
in
themselves
not
interesting
but
they
fascinate
when
we
approach
them
through
the
past
and
this
is
what
i
have
tried
to
do
by
the
double
arrangement
of
history
and
guide
the
guide
calls
for
no
introduction
it
is
written
from
the
practical
standpoint
and
is
intended
to
be
used
on
the
spot
maps
and
plans
accompany
it
the
city
is
divided
into
sections
the
visitor
in
every
case
starting
from
the
square
other
sections
deal
with
the
environs
and
with
the
surrounding
country
as
far
as
rosetta
on
the
east
and
abousir
on
the
west
in
transliterating
arabic
names
i
have
preferred
the
french
system
there
are
three
english
systems
each
backed
by
a
rival
government
department
so
the
french
seems
the
safer
course
and
if
i
have
not
kept
to
it
rigidly
i
am
only
following
though
at
a
respectful
distance
the
example
of
the
alexandria
municipality
here
and
there
some
history
has
crept
into
the
in
the
case
of
aboukir
whose
fortunes
though
dependent
on
alexandria
s
present
features
of
their
own
authorities
there
is
so
far
as
i
know
no
monograph
on
alexandria
and
though
the
present
little
book
makes
no
claim
to
original
research
it
has
drawn
together
much
information
that
was
hitherto

i
shall
never

the
kindness
that
i
have
received
at

and
in
no
wise
endorse
the
verdict
of
my
predecessor
the
poet
gelal
ed
din
ben
mokram
who
monstrously
asserts
that
the
visitor
to
alexandria
receives
nothing
in
the
way
of
hospitality
except
some
water
and
an
account
of
pompey

those
who
wish
to
treat
him
very
well
go
so
far
as
to
offer
some
fresh
air
and
to
tell
him
where
the

is
they
also

him
about

the
land
and
the
waters
the
situation
of
alexandria
is
most
curious
to
understand
it
we
must
go
back
many
thousand
years
ages
ago
before
there
was
civilization
in
egypt
or
the
delta
of
the
nile
had
been
formed
the
whole
of
the
country
as
far
south
as
cairo
lay
under
the
sea
the
shores
of
this
sea
were
a
limestone
desert
the
coastline
was
smooth
as
a
rule
but
at
the
corner
an
extraordinary
spur
jutted
out
from
the
main
mass
it
was
not
more
than
a
mile
wide
but
many
miles
long
its
base
is
not
far
from
the
modern
bahig
alexandria
is
built
down
it
and
its
tip
is
the
headland
of
aboukir
on
each
side
of
it
there
used
to
be
deep
salt
water
centuries
passed
and
the
nile
issuing
out
of
his
crack
above
cairo
kept
carrying
down
the
muds
of
upper
egypt
and
dropping
them
as
soon
as
his
current
slackened
in
the
corner
they
were
arrested
by
this
spur
and
began
to
silt
up
against
it
it
was
a
shelter
not
only
from
the
outer
sea
but
from
the
prevalent
wind
alluvial
land
appeared
the
huge
shallow
lake
of
mariout
was
formed
and
the
current
of
the
nile
unable
to
escape
through
the
limestone
barrier
rounded
the
headland
of
aboukir
and
entered
the
outer
sea
by
what
was
known
in
historical
times
as
the
canopic
mouth
this
explains
one
characteristic
of
alexandrian
long
narrow
ridge
edged
on
the
north
by
the
sea
and
on
the
south
by
a
lake
and
flat
fields
but
it
does
not
explain
why
alexandria
has
a
harbour
to
the
north
of
the
spur
and
more
or
less
parallel
to
it
runs
a
second
limestone
range
it
is
much
shorter
than
the
spur
and
much
lower
being
often
below
the
surface
of
the
sea
in
the
form
of
reefs
it
seems
unimportant
but
without
it
there
would
have
been
no
harbour
and
consequently
no
town
because
it
breaks
the
force
of
the
waves
starting
at
agame
it
continues
as
a
series
of
rocks
across
the
entrance
of
the
modern
harbour
then
it
reemerges
to
form
the
promontory
of
disappears
into
a
second
series
of
rocks
that
close
the
entrance
of
the
eastern
harbour
and
makes
its
final
appearance
at
the
promontory
of
silsileh
after
which
it
rejoins
the
big
spur
such
are
the
main
features
of
the
situation
a
limestone
ridge
with
harbours
on
one
side
of
it
and
alluvial
country
on
the
other
it
is
a
situation
unique
in
egypt
and
the
alexandrians
have
never
been

first

on

remarkable
stretch

there
seem
to
have
been

early
centres
i
homer
odyssey
book
iv
says
there
is
an
island
in
the
surging
sea
which
they
call
pharos
lying
off
egypt
it
has
a
harbour
with
good
anchorage
and
hence
they
put
out
to
sea
after
drawing
homer
s
island
is
now
the
promontory
of
the
intervening
channel
has
silted
up
there
are
no
traces
of
any
early
settlement
on
its
soil
but
in
the
sea
to
its
north
and
west
the
masonry
of
a
prehistoric
harbour
has
been
found
homer
goes
on
to
tell
how
menelaus
was
becalmed
on
pharos
as
he
returned
from
troy
and
how
he
could
not
get
away
until
he
had
entrapped
proteus
the
divine
king
of
the
island
and
exacted
a
favourable
wind
a
similar
legend
has
been
found
in
an
ancient
egyptian
papyrus
there
the
king
is
called
the
prouti
or
pharaoh
prouti
is
probably
the
original
of
homer
s
proteus
pharaoh
of
his
it
is
significant
that
our
first
glimpse
of
the
coast
should
be
through
the
eyes
of
a
greek
sailor
ii
but
our
historical
survey
must
begin
with
rhakotis
rhakotis
was
a
small
egyptian
town
built
on
the
rise
where
pompey
s
pillar
stands
now
and
it
existed
as
long
ago
as
for
statues
of
that
time
have
been
found
here
the
people
were
coast
guards
and
goat
herds
their

was

important
in

but
it
is
important
as
an
element
in
the
great
greek
city
that
was
built
up
round
it
it
was
a
little
lump
of
egypt
compare
it
to
the
arab
villages
and
slums
that
have
been
embedded
in
the
scheme
of
the
modern
mazarita
or
to
rhakotis
was
like
one
of
these
the
native
and
conservative
element
naturally
rallied
to
it
and
it
became
the
site
for
alexandria

great
religious
cult
of

iii
at
the

of

where
the

alexander
the
great
few
cities
have
made
so
magnificent
an
entry
into
history
as
alexandria
she
was
founded
by
alexander
the
great
when
he
arrived
here
he
was
only
years
old
his
career
must
be
sketched
he
was
a
macedonian
and
had
begun
by
destroying
the
of
ancient
greece
but
he
did
not
hate
the
greeks
no
he
admired
them
immensely
and
desired
to
be
treated
as
if
he
was
one
and
his
next
exploit
was
to
lead
a
crusade
against
greece
s
traditional
enemy
persia
and
to
defeat
her
in
two
tremendous
battles
one
at
the
dardanelles
and
one
in
asia
minor
as
soon
as
he
conquered
syria
egypt
fell
into
his
hands
and
fell
willingly
for
she
too
hated
the
persians
he
went
to
memphis
near
modern
cairo
then
he
descended
the
nile
to
the
coast
and
ordered
his
architect
dinocrates
to
build
round
the
nucleus
of
rhakotis
a
magnificent
greek
city
this
was
not
mere
idealism
on
his
part
or
rather
idealism
was
happily
combined
with
utility
he
needed
a
capital
for
his
new
egyptian
kingdom
and
to
link
it
with
macedonia
that
capital
had
to
be
on
the
coast
here
was
the
very
splendid
harbour
a
perfect
climate
fresh
water
limestone
quarries
and
easy
access
to
the
nile
here
he
would
perpetuate
all
that
was
best
in
hellenism
and
would
create
a
metropolis
for
that
greater
greece
that
should
consist
not
of
but
of
kingdoms
and
should
include
the
whole
inhabited
world
alexandria
was
founded
having
given
his
orders
the
young
man
hurried
on
he
never
saw
a
single
building
rise
his
next
care
was
a
visit
to
the
temple
of
ammon
in
the
siwan
oasis
where
the
priest
saluted
him
as
a
god
and
henceforward
his
greek
sympathies
declined
he
became
an
oriental
a
cosmopolitan
almost
and
though
he
fought
persia
again
it
was
in
a
new
spirit
he
wanted
to
harmonise
the
world
now
not
to
hellenise
it
and
must
have
looked
back
on
alexandria
as
a
creation
of
his
immaturity
but
he
was
after
all
to
return
to
her
eight
years
later
having
conquered
persia
he
died
and
his
body
after
some
vicissitudes
was
brought
to
memphis
for
burial
the
high
priest
refused
to
receive
it
there
do
not
settle
him
here
he
cried
but
at
the
city
he
has
built
at
rhakotis
for
wherever
this
body
must
lie
the
city
will
be
uneasy
disturbed
with
wars
and
so
he
descended
the
nile
again
wrapped
in
gold
and
enclosed
in
a
coffin
of
glass
and
he
was
buried
at
the
centre
of
alexandria
by
her
great
cross
roads
to
be
her
civic
hero
and

god

before
dissecting
alexander
s
plan
we
must
remember
three
differences
in
the
configuration
of
the
soil
as
it
existed
in
his
day
i
as
already
pointed
out
was
then
an
island
he
thought
of
building
here
but
rejected
the
site
as
too
cramped
a
shrine
to
his
dead
friend
hephaestion
rose
here
that
was
all
ii
lake
mariout
was
much
deeper
then
than
now
and
directly
connected
with
the
nile
consequently
it
was
almost
as
important
a
as
the
sea
and
a
lake
harbour
was
an
integral
part
of
the
plan
iii
there
was
then
through
between
the
mediterranean
and
the
red
sea
the
ancient
egyptians
had
cut
a
canal
from
the
nile
at
memphis
down
to
the
salt
lakes
that
begin
by
the
modern
ismailia
thus
alexandria
stood
in
the
position
of
port
said
a
maritime
gateway
to
india
and
the
remoter
east
the
city
was
oblong
and
filled
up
the
strip
between
the
lake
and
the
sea
she
was
laid
out
in
rigidly
straight
lines
her
main
street
the
canopic
still
exists
in
part
as
the
rue
rosette
it
ran
almost
due
east
and
bad
direction
because
it
was
cut
off
from
the
cool
north
wind
that
is
the
real
tutelary
god
of
alexandria
but
owing
to
the
site
nothing
else
could
be
contrived
westward
it
terminated
in
the
sea
eastward
it
proceeded
to
canopus
aboukir
it
was
the
natural
highway
along
the
limestone
spur
and
no
doubt
existed
long
before
alexander
came
crossing
the
canopic
street
and
following
the
line
of
the
present
rue
nebi
daniel
was
the
second
main
artery
the
street
of
the
soma
it
started
at
the
lake
harbour
and
ran
northward
to
the
sea
where
it
intersected
the
canopic
street
stood
the
soma
or
burial
place
of
to
the
present
mosque
parallel
to
these
two
streets
ran
others
dividing
the
city
into
blocks
of
an
american
regularity
it
could
not
have
been
picturesque
but
the
greeks
did
not
desire
picturesqueness
they
liked
to
lay
their
towns
out
and
halicarnassus
had
just
been
laid
out
on
the
same
the
only
natural
feature
they
cared
to
utilise
was
the
sea
the
blocks
were
labelled
according
to
the
letters
of
the
greek
alphabet
of
the
sea
front
magnificent
use
was
to
be
made
only
one
feature
shall
be
mentioned
here
the
dyke
heptastadion
seven
stades
long
which
was
built
to
connect
the
island
of
pharos
and
the
mainland
it
performed
two
functions
it
enlarged
the
city
area
and
it
broke
the
force
of
the
currents
and
created
a
double
great
harbour
to
the
east
and
the
eunostos
safe
return
to
the
west
in
the
arab
period
the
heptastadion
silted
up
and
became
the
neck
of
land
that
leads
to
the
course
of
the
walls
is
uncertain
perhaps
their
eastern
course
was
from
the
promontory
of
silsileh
to
the
lake
and
their
western
from
the
modern
gabbari
to
the
lake
their
foundations
were
accompanied
by
a
portent
of
the
usual
type
there
was
not
enough
chalk
to
mark
the
outlines
so
meal
had
to
be
substituted
and
a
number
of
birds
flew
out
of
the
lake
and
ate
it
all
up
the
greeks
interpreted
the
portent
satisfactorily
to
the
egyptians
it
might
well
have
symbolised
the
advent
of
the
hungry
foreigner
we
are
not
told
what
was
substituted
for
the
meal
but
somehow
or
other
the
walls
were
built

whom
they
inserted
posthumously
in

as

he
desired
neither
to

the
world
nor
to
harmonise
it
but
he
was
no
cynic
either
he
respected
mental
as
well
as
material
activity
he
had
been
present
at
the
foundation
of
alexandria
and
had
evidently
decided
that
the
place
would
suit
him
and
now
taking
up
his
abode
in
the
unfinished
city
he
began
to
adorn
her
with
architecture
and
scholarship
and
song
rival
generals
especially
in
asia
minor
and
macedonia
occupied
much
of
his
energy
at
the
very
beginning
of
his
rule
he
was
involved
in
a
curious
war
for
the
possession
of
the
corpse
of
alexander
which
he
had
kidnapped
as
it
was
on
its
way
from
persia
to
the
oasis
of
ammon
ptolemy
annexed
the
corpse
and
much
else
before
he
died
he
had
assumed
the
titles
of
king
and
of
soter
saviour
and
had
added
to
his
kingdom
cyrene
palestine
cyprus
and
parts
of
the
asia
minor
coast
of
this
substantial
domain
alexandria
was
the
capital
and
also
the
geographic
centre
then
as
now
she
belonged
not
so
much
to
egypt
as
to
the
mediterranean
and
the
ptolemies
realised
this
up
in
egypt
they
played
the
pharaoh
and
built
solemn
archaistic
temples
like
edfu
and
kom
ombo
down
in
alexandria
they
were
hellenistic
the
second
ptolemy
philadelphus
friend
of
his
sister
was
a
more
pretentious
person
than
his
father
he
is
famous
through
the
praises
of
the
poets
whom
he
patronised
and
of
the
jews
whom
he
invited
but
his
personal
achievements
were
slight
indeed
the
chief
event
of
his
reign
is
domestic
rather
than
he
married
his
sister
arsinoe
this
was
as
startling
to
greek
feelings
as
it
is
to
christian
but
in
egypt
he
had
a
prototype
in
the
god
osiris
who
had
married
his
sister
isis
and
he
justified
the
union
on
the
highest
sacerdotal
grounds
he
and
arsinoe
were
deified
as
the
adelphian
gods
in
whose
equal
veins
flowed
the
uncontaminated
blood
of
their
divine
father
the
general
and
their
example
was
followed
when
possible
by
their
successors
it
was
the
pride
of
race
carried
to
an
extreme
degree
the
royalties
of
for
fear
of
debasing
their
stock
marry
first
cousins
the
ptolemies
more
logical
tried
to
propagate
within
even
narrower
limits
in
flesh
as
in
spirit
the
dynasty
claimed
to
be
apart
from
common
men
and
to
appear
as
successive
emanations
of
the
deity
in
pairs
of
male
and
female
come
back
to
a
domineering
and
sinister
woman
she
was
seven
years
older
than
her
brother
and
when
they
married
he
had
already
a
wife
whom
she
drove
from
alexandria
by
her
intrigues
however
he
liked
her
and
when
a
martyr
to
indigestion
she
died
he
was
so
far
inconsolable
that
he
did
not
marry
again
the
closing
years
of
his
reign
were
divided
between
his
mistresses
and
the
gout
during
a
respite
from
the
latter
he
looked
out
of
his
palace
window
on
some
public
holiday
and
saw
beneath
him
the
natives
picnicking
on
the
sand
as
they
do
at
the
feast
of
they
were
obscure
they
were
happy
why
can
i
not
be
like
them
sighed
the
old
king
and
burst
into
tears
his
reign
had
been
imposing
rather
than
beautiful
and
had
initiated
little
in
alexandrian
civilization
beyond
the
somewhat
equivocal
item
of
a
mystic
marriage
he
could
endow
and
patronise
but
unlike
alexander
unlike
his
father
he
could
not
create
he
completed
what
they
had
laid
down
and
appropriated
the
praise
ptolemy
euergetes
was
the
son
of
philadelphus
by
his
first
wife
in
character
he
resembled
his
grandfather
he
was
a
sensible
and
successful
soldier
with
a
taste
for
science
by
marrying
his
cousin
berenice
he
secured
cyrene
which
had
the
most
highly
praised
of
all
the
ptolemaic
queens
though
we
know
nothing
of
her
character
in
their
reign
the
power
of
egypt
and
the
splendour
of
alexandria
came
to
their
height
it
is
now
time
to
examine
that
splendour
one
hundred

have

the

the

it
was
therefore
imperative
to
indicate
by
some
great

where
the

stood
it
was
desirable
too
to
provide
a
guide
for
sailors
through
the
limestone
reefs
that
line
the

for
these
reasons
the
ptolemies
built

bey
full
details
are

later
here
it
is
enough
to
note
that
the
pharos
as
it
was
called
was
the
greatest
practical
achievement
of
the
alexandrian
mind
and
the
outward
expression
of
the
mathematical
studies
carried
on
in
the
mouseion
sostratus
its
architect
was
contemporary
with
eratosthenes
and
euclid
a
fortress
as
well
as
a
beacon
the
pharos
was
the
pivot
of
the
city
s
naval
defences
it
dominated
both
the
harbours
and
kept
special
watch
over
the
more
precious
of

held

the

stretched

it
westward
it

the

was
prolonged
into
a

of

that
studded
the

connected

the

we
can

or
rather
it
certainly
covered
the
promontory
of

which
was
then
both
longer
and
broader
than
now
but
no
one
knows
how
far
the
buildings
stretched
inland

along
the
shore
nor
what
the
architecture
was
each
ptolemy
made
additions
and
the
whole
formed
a
special
quarter
somewhat
like
the
imperial
city
at
pekin
egypt
being
an
autocracy
the
palace
was
the
seat
of
government
as
well
as

residence
clerks
had
their
offices
there
there
was
a
left

an

called

rivalled

the

was
the
great

achievement
of
the
dynasty
not
only
did
it
mould
the

of
its
day
but
it
has
left
a
permanent
impress
upon
thought
its

have
all

the
very

is

perhaps

vast
areas
were
lecture
halls
laboratories
observatories
a
library
a
dining
hall
a
park
and
a
zoo
it
was
founded
by
ptolemy
soter
who
summoned
a
follower
of
aristotle
demetrius
phaleras
and
ordered
him
to
organise
an
institution
on
the
lines
of
the
athenian
philosophic
establishment
that
had
contained
the
library
of
aristotle
but
the
alexandrian
mouseion
soon
diverged
widely
from
its
model
it
was
far
richer
and
larger
for
one
thing
the
funds
being
administered
by
a
priest
who
was
appointed
by
the
king
and
it
was
essentially
a
court
institution
under
palace
control
and
knew
both
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
royal
patronage
in
some
ways
it
resembled
a
modern
university
but
the
scholars
and
scientists
and
literary
men
whom
it
supported
were
under
no
obligation
to
teach
they
had
only
to
pursue
their
studies
to
the
greater
glory
of
the
ptolemies
the
most
famous
element
in
this
enormous
institution
was
the
called
the
mother
library
to
distinguish
it
from
a
later
and
even
greater
collection
books
and
a
catalogue
that
occupied
the
post
of
librarian
was
of
immense
importance
and
its
holder
was
the
chief
official
in
the
mouseion
the
actual
literary
and
scientific
output
of
the
mouseion
will
be
considered

the
idea
that
one
religion
is
false
and
another
true
is
essentially
christian
and
had
not
occurred
to
the
egyptians
and
greeks
who
were
living
together
at
alexandria
each
worshipped
his
own
gods
just
as
he
spoke
his
own
language
but
he
never
thought
that
the
gods
of
his
neighbour
had
no
existence
and
he
was
willing
to
believe
that
they
might
be
his
own
gods
under
another
name
the
greeks
in
particular
held
this
view
and
had
already
identified
osiris
god
of
the
world
beyond
death
with
their
dionysus
who
was
a
god
of
mysteries
and
also
of
wine
so
when
ptolemy
soter
decided
to
compound
a
god
for
his
new
city
he
was
only
taking
advantage
of
this
tendency
and
giving
a
local
habitation
and
a
name
and
a
statue
to
sentiments
that
already
existed
osiris
was
the
main
ingredient
he
was
already
worshipped
on
the
hill
of
rhakotis
and
he
was
the
most
celebrated
of
the
egyptian
deities
to
him
was
added
the
bull
god
apis
of
memphis
whose
cult
had
been
recently
revived
and
out
of
their
names
was
formed
the
compound
but
while
the
origins
and
title
of
the
new
god
were
egyptian
his
appearance
and
attributes
were
greek
his
to
the
greek
sculptor
him
seated
in
greek
garments
upon
a
classic
throne
his
features
were
those
of
the
bearded
zeus
but
softened
and
benign
indeed
he
more
closely
resembled
aesculapius
god
of
healing
to
whom
in
a
civilised
age
men
naturally
turned
the
basket
on
his
head
showed
that
he
was
a
harvest
god
the
cerberus
stood
by
his
side
to
show
that
he
represented
pluto
god
of
the
underworld
the
ptolemies
could
launch
such
a
being
without
any
fear
of
wounding
religious
susceptibilities
what
they
could
not
have
foreseen
was
his
success
serapis
not
only
fulfilled
their
immediate
political
aim
of
providing
the
alexandrians
with
a
common
cult
he
spread

and

him

all
over
the

world
may
seem
to
us
an
artificial
compound
but
it
stood
the
test
of
time
it
satisfied
men
s
desires
and
was
to
be
the
last
stronghold
of
paganism
against
christianity

on

laid
down
by

executed
by

that

there
also

have
been

there
were
certainly
none
of

that
reminded
athens
and
even
rome
of
an
unanalysable
past
in
one
sense
the

was
more
greek

at

when
the

spirit
had
freed
itself
from

was
winning

her

she

as

in

and
she
struck
a
chill
into
the
whole
hellenistic
world
she
was
horrified
at
its
corruption
of
which
she
never
failed
to
take
advantage
and
the
shattered
empire
of
alexander
fell
piece
by

hands
the
ptolemies
were

of

curious
alliance

it

over

decayed

declared
herself

creditors
and
to
raise
the
necessary
sum

he
had
to
grind
down
the
people
with

rome
was
shocked
but
firm
against
this
relentless
advance
alexandria
could
do
nothing
she
was
the
brain
of
egypt
and
its
five
senses
too
and
as
each
embassy
touched
her
quays
she
realised
as
the

could
not
that
the
glory
was
departing
from

there
was

it
the

absorbed

was

was
their
general

he
was
defeated
and
drowned
his
army
was
destroyed
and
caesar
returned
in
triumph
to
its
city
and
to
cleopatra
cleopatra
s
fortune
now
seemed
assured
having
married
her
younger
brother
as
ptolemy
xv
she
went
for
a
trip
with
caesar
up
the
nile
to
show
him
its
antiquities
the
egyptians
detested
her
as
their
betrayer
but
she
was
indifferent
she
bore
caesar
a
son
and
followed
him
to
rome
there
to
display
her
insolence
she
was
at
the
height
of
her
beauty
and
power
when
the
blow
fell
on
the
ides
of
march
caesar
was
murdered
she
had
chosen
the
wrong
lover
after
all
back
in
alexandria
again
she
watched
the
second
between
mark
antony
and
caesar
s
murderers
she
helped
neither
party
and
when
antony
won
he
summoned
her
to
explain
her
neutrality
she
came
not
in
a
carpet
but
in
a
gilded
barge
and
her
life
henceforward
belongs
less
to
history
than
to
poetry
it
is
almost
impossible
to
think
of
the
later
cleopatra
as
an
ordinary
person
she
has
joined
the
company
of
helen
and
iseult
yet
her
character
remained
the
same
voluptuous
but
watchful
she
treated
her
new
lover
as
she
had
treated
her
old
she
never
bored
him
and
since
grossness
means
monotony
she
sharpened
his
mind
to
those
more
delicate
delights
where
sense
verges
into
spirit
her
infinite
variety
lay
in
that
she
was
the
last
of
a
secluded
and
subtle
race
she
was
a
flower
that
alexandria
had
taken
three
hundred
years
to
produce
and
that
eternity
can
not
wither
and
she
unfolded
herself
to
a
simple
but
intelligent
roman
soldier
alexandria
now
reconciled
to
her
fate
and
protected
by
the
legions
of
antony
became
the
capital
of
the
eastern
world
the
western
belonged
to
octavian
caesar
s
nephew
and
a
third
duel
was
inevitable
it
was
postponed
for
some
years
during
which
antony
acquired
and
deserted
a
roman
wife
and
cleopatra
bore
him
several
children

son

and
splendour
ended
in
the
naval
disaster
of
actium
in
the
adriatic
where
octavian
defeated
their
combined
fleets
the
defeat
was
hastened
by
cleopatra
s
cowardice
at
the
decisive
moment
she
fled
with
sixty
ships
actually
breaking
her
way
through
antony
s
line
from
the
rear
and
throwing
it
into
confusion
he
followed
her
to
alexandria
and
there
when
the
recriminations
had
ceased
they
resumed
their
life
of
pleasures
that
were
both
shadowed
and
sharpened
by
the
approach
of
death
they
made
no
attempt
to
oppose
the
pursuing
octavian
instead
they
formed
a
suicide
club
and
antony
to
imitate
the
misanthrope
timon
built
a
hermitage
in
the
western
harbour
which
he
called
timonium
nor
was
religion
silent
the
god
hercules
whom
he
loved
and
who
loved
him
was
heard
passing
away
from
alexandria
one
night
in
exquisite
music
and
song
arrival
of
octavian
he
is
one
of
the
most
odious
of
the
world
s
successful
men
and
to
his
cold
mind
the
career
of
cleopatra
could
appear
as
nothing
but
a
vulgar
debauch
vice
in
his
opinion
should
be
furtive
at
his
approach
antony
after
resisting
outside
the
canopic
gate
at
caesar
s
camp
retreated
into
the
city
and
fell
upon
his
sword
he
was
carried
dying
to
cleopatra
who
had
retired
into
their
tomb
and
their
story
now
rises
to
the
immortality
of
art
shakespeare
drew
his
inspiration
from
plutarch
who
was
himself
inspired
and
it
is
difficult
through
their
joint
emotion
to
realise
the
actual
facts
the
asp
for
example
the
asp
is
not
a
certainty
it
was
never
known
how
cleopatra
died
she
was
captured
and
taken
to
octavian
with
whom
even
in
antony
s
she
had
been
intriguing
for
the
courtesan
in
her
persisted
she
appeared
this
time
not
in
a
carpet
nor
yet
in
a
barge
but
upon
a
sofa
in
the
seductive
negligence
of
grief
the
good
young
man
was
shocked
realising
that
he
intended
to
lead
her
in
his
triumph
at
rome
realising
too
that
she
was
now
years
old
she
killed
herself
she
was
buried
in
the
tomb
with
antony
and
her
ladies
charmion
and
iras
who
died
with
her

thus
the

of

city
closes
as
it
began
in
an
atmosphere
of
romance
cleopatra
is
of
course
a
meaner
figure
than
alexander
the
great
ambition
with
her
is
purely
selfish
with
alexander
it
was
mystically
connected
with
the
welfare
of
mankind
she
knows
nothing
beyond
the
body
and
so
shrinks
from
discomfort
and
pain
alexander
attained
the
strength
of
the
hero
yet
for
all
their
differences
the
man
who
created
and
the
woman
who
lost
alexandria
have
one
element
in
common
monumental
greatness
and
between
them
is
suspended
like
a
rare
and
fragile
chain
the
dynasty
of
the
ptolemies
it
is
a
dynasty
much
censored
by
historians
but
the
egyptians
who
lived
under
it
were
more
tolerant
for
it
had
one
element
of
greatness
it
did
represent
the
complex
country
that
it
ruled
in
upper
egypt
it
carried
on
the
tradition
of
the
pharaohs
on
the
coast
it
was
hellenistic
and
in
touch
with
mediterranean
culture
after
its
extinction
the
vigour
of
alexandria
turns
inwards
she
is
to
do
big
things
in
philosophy
and
religion
but
she
is
no
longer
the
capital
of
a
kingdom
no
longer
royal
ptolemaic
culture
before
leaving
the
ptolemies
let
us
glance
back
at
their
civilisation
we
have
seen
how
they
founded
two
great
institutions
the
palace
and
the
mouseion
which
communicated
with
one
another
and
which
stretched
from
the
promontory
of
silsileh
to
some
point
far
as
the
modern
railway
station
perhaps
it
was
in
this
area
among
gardens
and
colonnades
that
the
culture
of
alexandria
came
into
being
the
palace
provided
the
finances
and
called
the
tune
the
mouseion
responded
with
imagination
or
knowledge
the
connection
between
them
was
so
intimate
as
almost
to
be
absurd
when
for
instance
queen
berenice
the
wife
of
euergetes
lost
her
hair
from
the
temple
where
she
had
dedicated
it
it
was
the
duty
of
the
court
astronomer
to
detect
it
as
a
constellation
and
of
the
court
poet
to
write
an
elegy
thereon
and
stratonice
who
was
perfectly
bald
presented
an
even
more
delicate
problem
she
sent
over
a
message
to
the
mouseion
that
something
must
be
written
about
her
hair
also
victory
odes
funeral
dirges
marriage
hymns
jokes
genealogical
trees
medical
prescriptions
mechanical
toys
maps
engines
of
war
whatever
the
palace
required
it
had
only
to
inform
the
mouseion
and
the
subsidised
staff
set
to
work
at
once
the
poets
and
scientists
there
did
nothing
that
would
annoy
the
royal
family
and
not
much
that
would
puzzle
it
for
they
knew
that
if
they
failed
to
give
satisfaction
they
would
be
expelled
from
the
enchanted
area
and
have
to
find
another
patron
or
starve
it
was
not
an
ideal
arrangement
as
outsiders
were
prompt
to
point
out
and
snobbery
and
servility
taint
the
culture
of
alexandria
from
the
first
it
sprang
up
behind
walls
it
never
knew
loneliness
nor
the
glories
and
the
dangers
of
independence
and
the
marvel
is
that
it
flourished
as
well
as
it
did
at
all
events
it
is
idle
to
criticise
it
for
not
being
different
for
if
it
had
been
different
it
would
not
have
been
alexandrian
in
spirit
as
in
fact
the
palace
and
the
mouseion
touched
and
the
palace
was
the
stronger
and
the
older
the
contact
strangled
philosophy
and
deprived
literature
of
such
sustenance
as
philosophy
can
bring
to
her
but
it
encouraged
science
and
gave
even
to
literature
certain
graces
that
she
had
hitherto
ignored
temple
where
berenice
dedicated
her
hair
a
literature
callimachus
about
apollonius
of
rhodes
theocritus
about
the
literature
that
grew
up
in
the
mouseion
had
no
lofty
aims
it
was
not
interested
in
ultimate
problems
nor
even
in
problems
of
behaviour
and
it
attempted
none
of
the
higher
problems
of
art
to
be
graceful
or
pathetic
or
learned
or
amusing
or
indecent
and
in
any
case
sufficed
it
so
that
though
full
of
experiments
it
is
quite
devoid
of
adventure
it
developed
when
the
heroic
age
of
greece
was
over
when
liberty
was
lost
and
possibly
honour
too
it
was
disillusioned
and
we
may
be
glad
that
is
was
not
embittered
also
it
had
strength
of
a
kind
for
it
saw
that
out
of
the
wreck
of
traditional
hopes
three
good
things
the
decorative
surface
of
the
universe
the
delights
of
study
and
the
delights
of
love
and
that
of
these
three
the
best
was
love
ancient
greece
had
also
sung
of
love
but
with
restraint
regarding
it
as
one
activity
among
many
the
alexandrians
seldom
sang
of
anything
else
their
epigrams
their
elegies
and
idylls
their
one
great
epic
all
turn
on
the
tender
passion
and
celebrate
it
in
ways
that
previous
ages
had
never
known
and
that
future
ages
were
to
know
too
well
darts
and
hearts
sighs
and
eyes
breasts
and
chests
all
originated
in
alexandria
and
from
the
intercourse
between
palace
and
devices
but
then
they
were
fresh
who
sculptured
love
and
set
him
by
the
pool

in
brief
the
characteristics
of

and
the
theme
of
love
love
as
a
cruel
and
wanton
boy
flits
through
the
literature
of
alexandria
as
through
the
thousands
of
terra
cotta
statuettes
that
have
been
exhumed
from
her
soil
one
tires
of
him
but
it
is
appropriate
that
he
should
have
been
born
under
a
dynasty
that
culminated
in
cleopatra
literature
took
its
tone
from
fine
poet
though
not
as
fine
as
his
patrons
supposed
he
began
life
as
a
schoolmaster
at
eleusis
the
modern
nouzha
and
then
was
called
to
the
mouseion
where
he
became
librarian
under
euergetes
his
learning
was
immense
his
wit
considerable
his
loyalty
untiring
it
was
he
who
wrote
the
poem
about
berenice
s
hair
dainty
and
pedantic
in
all
that
he
did
he
announced
that
a
big
book
is
a
big
nuisance
and
cared
more
about
neatness
of
expression
than
depth
of
feeling
though
the
feeling
emerges
in
his
famous
epigram
someone
told
me
heracleitus
of
your
end
and
i
wept
and
thought
how
often
you
and
i
sunk
the
sun
with
talking
well
and
now
you
lie
antiquated
ashes

footnote
translated
by
furness
only
once
was
this
exquisite
career
interrupted
there
was
among
his
pupils
a
young
man
from
rhodes
with
thin
legs
by
name
apollonius
apollonius
was
ambitious
to
write
an
form
of
composition
detested
by
callimachus
and
opposed
to
all
his
theories
in
vain
he
objected
apollonius
then
only
eighteen
gave
in
the
mouseion
a
public
reading
of
the
preliminary
draft
of
his
poem
a
violent
quarrel
was
the
result
apollonius
was
expelled
and
callimachus
wrote
a
satire
called
the
ibis
in
which
his
rival
s
legs
and
other
deficiencies
were
exposed
the
friends
of
apollonius
retorted
with
equal
spirit
and
the
tranquillity
of
the
mouseion
was
impaired
callimachus
won
but
his
victory
was
not
eternal
after
his
death
apollonius
was
recalled
to
alexandria
and
in
time
became
librarian
there
in
his
turn
the
epic
apollonius
insisted
on
writing
has
survived
it
is
modelled
on
homer
and
deals
with
the
voyage
of
the
argo
to
recover
the
golden
fleece
but
there
is
nothing
homeric
in
the
treatment
and
though
we
are
supposed
to
be
in
barbaric
lands
we
never
really
leave
the
cultivated
court
of
the
ptolemies
love
is
still
the
ruling
interest
he
slips
the
naughty
little
boy
into
the
palace
of
medea
and
shoots
his
tiny
dart
at
her
to
inspire
her
with
passion
for
jason
so
might
he
have
inspired
queen
berenice
or
arsinoe
pains
languors
and
raptures
succeed
and
the
theme
of
the
heroic
quest
is
forgotten
callimachus
can
have
found
nothing
to
object
to
in
such
a
poem
except
its
length
for
it
is
typical
of
his
school
its
pictorial
method
is
also
characteristic
of
alexandria
many
of
the
episodes
might
be
illustrated
by
terra
cotta
statues
and
gems
but
one
of
the
poets
who
worked
in
the
a
genius
of
a
very
different
kind
a
genius
that
alexandria
matured
but
can
not
be
said
to
have
formed
theocritus
came
here
late
in
his
career
he
had
been
born
at
cos
and
had
lived
in
sicily
and
he
arrived
full
of
memories
that
no
could
of
fresh
air
and
the
sun
of
upland
meadows
and
overhanging
trees
of
goats
and
sheep
of
the
men
and
the
women
who
looked
after
them
and
of
all
the
charm
and
the
coarseness
that
go
to
make
up
country
life
he
had
thrown
these
memories
into
poetical
form
sometimes
idealising
them
sometimes
giving
them
crudely
and
he
had
called
these
poems
pictures
of
rural
existence
love
mythological
fancies
decorative
liked
these
things
too
but
he
backed
them
with
a
width
of
experience
and
a
zest
for
it
that
callimachus
and
apollonius
never
knew
while
they
are
classics
who
have
to
be
studied
theocritus
appeals
to
us
at
once
his
fifteenth
idyll
describing
life
in
the
greek
quarter
at
alexandria
is
as
vivid
now
as
when
he
wrote
it
the
dialogue

it

this
hymn
theocritus
displays
the
other
side
of
his
alexandrian
side
he
is
no
longer
the
amusing
realist
but
an
erudite
poet
whose
chief
theme
is

remarks

and
when
he
s
kept
waiting
for
his
dinner
he
s
as
sour
as
they
salute
the
risen
god
and
go
this
delightful
idyll
is
not
quite
characteristic
of
generally
sings
of
shepherds
and
their
flocks
but
it
is
his
great
contribution
to
the
literature
of
alexandria
and
our
chief
authority
for
daily
life
under
the
ptolemies
history
is
too
much
an
affair
of
armies
and
kings
the

from

the
greatest
period
that

ever
even

century
it

not

mathematics

obscure
career
of

nothing
is
known
about
euclid
indeed
one
thinks
of
him
more
as
a
branch
of
knowledge
than
as
a
man
but
euclid
was
once
alive
landing
here
in
the
reign
of
ptolemy
philadelphus
and
informing
that
superficial
monarch
that
there
is
no
royal
road
to
here
he
composed
among
other
works
his
elements
in
which
he
incorporated

which
have
remained
the

s

for

almost
down
to

day
here
he
founded
a
mathematical
school
that
lasted
years
and
acknowledged
his
leadership
to
the
last
apollonius
of
perga
who
inaugurated
the
study
of
conic
sections
was
his
immediate
pupil
hyspicles
added
to
the
thirteen
books
of
his
elements
two
books
more
and
to
the
martyred
the
elements
and
gave
them
their
present
form
so
that
from
first
to
last
the
mathematicians
of
alexandria
were
preoccupied
with
him
an
insignificant
man
according
to
tradition
and
very
shy
his
snub
to
philadelphus
seems
to
have
been
exceptional
ii
geography
in
geography
there
are
two
leading
and
claudius
ptolemy
eratosthenes
is
the
greater
he
seems
to
have
been
an
all
round
genius
eminent
in
literature
as
well
as
science
he
was
born
at
cyrene
in
and
on
the
death
of
callimachus
was
invited
to
alexandria
to
become
librarian
it
was
in
the
mouseion
observatory
that
he
measured
the
not
the
greatest
achievement
of
alexandrian
science
but
certainly
the
most
thrilling
his
method
was
as
follows
he
knew
that
the
earth
is
round
and
he
was
told
that
the
midsummer
sun
at
assouan
in
upper
egypt
cast
no
shadow
at
midday
at
alexandria
at
the
same
moment
it
did
cast
a
shadow
alexandria
being
further
to
the
north
on
the
same
longitude
on
measuring
the
alexandria
shadow
he
found
that
it
was
of
a
complete
that
the
distance
from
alexandria
to
assouan
must
be
the
circumference
of
the
earth
he
estimated
the
distance
at
miles
and
consequently
arrived
at
miles
for
the
complete
circumference
and
for
the
diameter
in
the
latter
calculation
he
is
only
miles
out
it
is
strange
that
when
science
had
once
gained
such
triumphs
mankind
should
ever
have
slipped
back
again
into
fairy
tales
and
barbarism
illustration
the
world
according
to
eratosthenes
illustration
the
world
according
to
claudius
ptolemy
the
other
great
work
of
eratosthenes
was
his
geographies
including
all
previous
knowledge
on
the
subject
just
as
the
elements
of
euclid
had
included
all
previous
mathematical
knowledge
the
geographies
were
in
three
books
and
to
them
was
attached
a
map
of
the
known
world
see
it
is
of
course
full
of
great
britain
is
too
large
india
fails
to
be
a
peninsula
and
the
caspian
sea
connects
with
the
arctic
ocean
but
it
is
conceived
in
the
scientific
spirit
it
represents
the
world
as
eratosthenes
thought
it
was
not
as
he
thought
it
ought
to
be
when
he
knows
nothing
he
inserts
nothing
he
is
not
ashamed
to
leave
blank
spaces
he
bases
it
on
such
facts
as
he
knew
and
had
he
known
more
facts
he
would
have
altered
it
the
other
great
geographer
claudius
ptolemy
belongs
to
a
later
period
but
it
is
convenient
to
notice
him
here
possibly
he
was
a
connection
of
the
late
royal
family
but
nothing
is
known
of
his
life
his
fame
has
outshone
eratosthenes
and
no
doubt
he
was
more
learned
for
more
facts
were
at
his
disposal
yet
we
can
trace
in
him
the
decline
of
the
scientific
spirit
observe
his
map
of
the
world
at
first
sight
it
is
superior
to
the
eratosthenes
map
the
caspian
sea
is
corrected
new
inserted
and
there
are
in
the
original
many
more
names
but
there
is
one
significant
mistake
he
has
prolonged
africa
into
an
imaginary
continent
and
joined
it
up
to
china
it
was
a
mere
flight
of
his
fancy
he
even
scattered
this
continent
with
towns
and
rivers
no
one
corrected
the
mistake
and
for
hundreds
of
years
it
was
believed
that
the
indian
ocean
was
land
bound
the
age
of
enquiry
was
over
and
the
age
of
authority
had
begun
and
it
is
worth
noting
that
the
decline
of
science
at
alexandria
exactly
coincides
with
the
rise
of
christianity
iii
astronomy
and
the
calendar
astronomy
develops
on
the
same
lines
as
geography
there
is
an
early
period
of
scientific
research
under
eratosthenes
and
there
is
a
later
period
in
which
claudius
ptolemy
codifies
the
results
and
dictates
his
opinions
to
posterity
he
announced
for
example
that
the
universe
revolves
round
the
earth
and
this
ptolemaic
theory
was
adopted
by
all
subsequent
astronomers
until
galileo
and
supported
by
all
the
thunders
of
the
church
yet
another
view
had
been
put
forward
though
ptolemy
ignores
it
aristarchus
of
samos
working
at
alexandria
with
eratosthenes
had
suggested
that
the
earth
might
revolve
round
the
sun
and
it
is
only
a
chance
that
this
view
was
not
stamped
as
official
and
imposed
as
orthodox
all
through
the
middle
ages
we
do
not
know
what
aristarchus
arguments
were
for
his
writings
have
perished
but
we
may
be
sure
that
working
in
the
century
he
had
arguments
and
did
not
take
refuge
in
authority
astronomy
under
the
ptolemies
was
a
serious
only
by
the
episode
of
berenice
s
hair
as
to
the
calendar
the
calendar
we
now
use
was
worked
out
in
alexandria
the
ancient
egyptians
had
calculated
the
year
at
days
it
is
actually
so
before
long
they
were
hopelessly
out
the
official
harvest
festival
for
instance
only
coincided
with
the
actual
harvest
once
in
years
they
were
aware
of
the
discrepancy
but
were
too
conservative
to
alter
it
that
was
left
to
alexandria
in
the
little
daughter
of
ptolemy
euergetes
died
and
the
priests
of
serapis
at
canopus
passed
a
decree
making
her
a
goddess
a
reformer
even
in
his
grief
the
king
induced
them
to
rectify
the
calendar
at
the
same
time
by
decreeing
the
existence
of
a
leap
year
to
occur
every
four
years
as
at
present
he
attempted
to
harmonise
the
traditions
of
egypt
with
the
science
of
greece
the
typical
of
for
though
the
priests
passed
the
decree
they
kept
to
their
old
chronology
it
was
not
until
julius
caesar
came
to
egypt
that
the
cause
of
reform
prevailed
he
established
the
alexandrian
year
as
official
and
modelled
on
it
the
julian
which
we
use
in
europe
the
two
years
were
of
the
same
length
but
the
alexandrian
retained
the
old
egyptian
arrangement

realised

also
forbade

without

on
the
ground
that
the
religious
orgies
there
would
corrupt

the
true
reason
was

thus
control

of
the
emperor
who
himself
appointed

alexandria
turned
into
a
vast
imperial
granary
where
the
tribute
collected
in
kind
from
the
cultivators
was
stored
for

it

octavian

successor

was
introduced
into

by

who
in
converted
a
jewish
shoemaker
named
annianus
and
who
in
was
martyred
for
protesting
against
the
worship
of

there
is
no

this
tradition
the
origins
of
the
movement
were
unfashionable
and
obscure
and
the
authorities
took
little
notice
of
it
until
it
disobeyed
their
regulations
its
doctrines
were
confounded
partly
with
the
judaism
from

they

with

says
those
who
worship
serapis
are
christians
and
those
who
call
themselves
bishops
of

are
devoted
to
serapis
showing
how
indistinct
was
the
impression
that
the
successors
of
mark
had
made
the
letter

as
a
race
of

triumph

to
free
imprisoned

would
lead

in
harmony
and
peace
to

a

little
boy
playing
with

on

that
is
to
say
he
was
playing
at
baptism
which
not
being
in
orders
he
had
no
right
to
do
and
the
patriarch
who
happened
to
be
looking
out
of
the
palace
window
tried
to
stop
him
no
one
ever
succeeded
in
stopping
athanasius
he
baptised
his
playmates
and
the
patriarch
struck
by
his
precocity
recognised
the
sacrament
as
valid
and
engaged
the
active
young
theologian
as
his
secretary
physically
athanasius
was
blackish
and
small
but
strong
and
extremely
recognises
a
modern
street
type
his
character
can
scarcely
be
discerned
through
the
dust
of
the
century
but
he
was
certainly
not
loveable
though
he
lived
to
be
a
popular
hero
his
powers
were
remarkable
as
a
theologian
he
knew
what
is
true
and
as
a
politician
he
knew
how
truth
can
be
enforced
and
his
career
blends
subtlety
with
vigour
and
with
craft
in
the
most
remarkable
way
the
started
the
nature
of
christ
its
doctrinal
import
is
discussed
below
here
we
are
only
dealing
with
the
outward
results
constantine
who
was
no
theologian
and
dubiously
christian
was
appalled
by
the
schism
which
rapidly
divided
his
empire
he
wrote
counselling
charity
and
when
he
was
ignored
summoned
the
disputants
to
nicaea
on
the
black
sea
two
hundred
and
fifty
bishops
and
many
priests
attended
and
amid
great
violence
the
was
passed
and
arius
condemned
athanasius
who
was
still
only
a
deacon
returned
in
triumph
to
alexandria
and
soon
afterwards
became
patriarch
here
but
his
troubles
were
only
beginning
constantine
still
obsessed
with
hopes
of
toleration
asked
him
to
receive
arius
back
he
refused
and
was
banished
himself
he
was
banished
five
times
in
by
the
orthodox
constantine
twice
by
the
arian
constantius
and
once
by
the
pagan
julian
and
once
shortly
before
his
death
by
the
arian
valens
sometimes
he
hid
in
the
lybian
desert
sometimes
he
escaped
to
rome
or
palestine
and
made
christendom
ring
with
his
grievances
twice
he
came
near
to
death
in
in
the
caesareum
where
he
marched
processionally
out
of
one
door
as
the
enemy
came
in
at
the
other
and
once
in
theonas
at
night
where
he
escaped
from
the
altar
just
before
the
arian
soldiers
murdered
him
there
he
always
returned
and
he
had
the
supreme
joy
of
outliving
arius
who
fell
down
dead
one
evening
while
walking
through
alexandria
with
a
friend
to
us
living
in
a
secular
age
such
triumphs
appear
remote
and
it
seems
better
to
die
young
like
alexander
the
great
than
to
drag
out
this
arid
theological
odyssey
but
athanasius
has
the
immortality
that
he
would
have
desired
owing
to
his
efforts
the
church
has
accepted
as
final
his
opinion
on
the
nature
of
christ
and
duly
grateful
has
recognised
him
as
a
doctor
and
canonised
him
as
a
saint
in
alexandria
a
large
church
was
built
to
commemorate
his
name

the
monks
had
not
been
important
so
long
as
each
lived
alone
but
by
the
they
had
gathered
into
formidable
communities
whence
they
would
occasionally
make
raids
on
civilisation
like
the
bedouins
one
of
these
communities
was
only
nine

from

lay
further

the
monks
had
some
knowledge
of
theology
and
of

craft
but
they
were
averse
to
culture
and
incapable
of

their
heroes
were
ammon

deserted

or
antony
who
thought
bathing
sinful
and
was
consequently
carried
across

of

by
an
angel
from
the
ranks
of
such
men
the
patriarchs
were
recruited
christianity
which
had
been
made
official
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
was
made
compulsory
towards
its
close
and
this

of

had
been

surrounding

a
monastery
was
installed
on
the

the
persecution
of
the

continued
and
culminated
in
the

the
achievements
of
hypatia
like
her
youthfulness
have
been
exaggerated
she
was
a
lady
who
taught
mathematics
at
the
mouseion
and
though
she
was
a
philosopher
too
we
have
no
record
of
her
doctrines
the
monks
were
now
supreme
and
one
of
them
had
murdered
the
imperial
prefect
and
had
been
canonised
for
the
deed
by
the
patriarch
cyril
cyril
s
wild
black
army
filled
the
streets
human
only
in
their
faces
and
anxious
to
perform
some
crowning
piety
before
they
retired
to
their
monasteries
in
this
mood
they
encountered
hypatia
who
was
driving
from
a
lecture
probably
along
the
course
of
the
present
rue
nebi
daniel
dragged
her
from
the
carriage
to
the
caesareum
and
there
tore
her
to
pieces
with
tiles
she
is
not
a
great
figure
but
with
her
the
greece
that
is
a
spirit
greece
that
tried
to
discover
truth
and
create
beauty
and
that
had
created
alexandria
the
monks
however
have
another
aspect
they
were
the
nucleus
of
a
national
movement
nationality
did
not
exist
in
the
modern
was
a
religious
not
a
patriotic
age
but
under
the
cloak
of
religion
racial
passions
could
shelter
and
the
monks
killed
hypatia
not
only
because
they
knew
she
was
sinful
but
also
because
they
thought
she
was
foreign
they
were
and
later
on
they
and
their
lay
adherents
were
given
the
name
of
copts
copt
means
the
language
of
the
copts
was
derived
from
the
ancient
egyptian
their
script
was
greek
with
the
addition
of
six
letters
adapted
from
the
hieroglyphs
the
new
movement
permeated
the
whole
country
even
cosmopolitan
alexandria
and
as
soon
as
it
found
a
theological
formula
in
which
to
express
itself
a
revolt
against
constantinople
broke
out
that
formula
is
known
as
its
theological
concerns
the
nature
of
discussed
below
here
we
are
concerned
with
its
outward
effects
the
patriarch
dioscurus
successor
and
nephew
to
cyril
is
the
first
monophysite
hero
and
the
real
founder
of
the
coptic
church
the
emperor
took
up
a
high
and
mighty
line
and
at
the
council
of
chalcedon
near
constantinople
dioscurus
was
exiled
and
his
doctrines
condemned
from
that
moment
no
greek
was
safe
in
egypt
the
racial
trouble
which
had
been
averted
by
the
ptolemies
broke
out
at
last
and
has
not
even
died
down
before
long
alexandria
was
saddled
with
two
patriarchs
there
was
i
the
orthodox
or
royal
patriarch
who
upheld
the
decrees
of
chalcedon
he
was
appointed
by
the
emperor
and
had
most
of
the
church
revenues
but
he
had
no
spiritual
authority
over
the
egyptians
to
them
he
was
an
odious
greek
official
disguised
as
a
priest
ii
the
monophysite
or
coptic
patriarch
who
opposed
regular
egyptian
monk
poor
bigoted
and
popular
each
of
these
patriarchs
claimed
to
represent
mark
and
the
only
true
church
each
of
them
is
represented
by
a
patriarch
in
alexandria
now
and
then
an
emperor
tried
to
heal
the
schism
and
made
concessions
to
the
egyptian
faith
but
the
schism
was
racial
the
concessions
theological
so
nothing
was
effected
egypt
was
only
held
for
the
empire
by
greek
garrisons
and
consequently
when
the
arabs
came
they
conquered

we
are
now
approaching
the
catastrophe
its
details
though
dramatic
are
confusing
it
took
place
during
the
reign
of
the
emperor
heraclius
and
we
must
begin
by
glancing
at
his
curious
career
heraclius
was
an
able
and
sensitive
sensitive
very
much
in
the
grip
of
his
own
moods
sometimes
he
appears
as
a
hero
a
great
administrator
sometimes
as
an
apathetic
recluse
he
won
his
empire
by
the
sword
then
the
reaction
came
and
he
allowed
the
persians
to
occupy
syria
and
egypt
almost
without
striking
a
blow
alexandria
fell
by
treachery
she
was
safe
on
the
seaward
side
for
the
persians
had
no
fleet
and
her
immense
walls
made
her
impregnable
by
land
their
army
which
was
encamped
near
mex
could
burn
monasteries
but
do
nothing
more
but
a
foreign
was
his
into
touch
with
them
and
revealed
the
secrets
of
her
topography
a
canal
ran
through
her
from
the
western
harbour
rather
to
the
north
of
the
present
mahmoudieh
canal
and
it
passed
by
a
bridge
under
the
canopic
way
present
rue
sidi
metwalli
the
harbour
end
of
the
canal
was
unguarded
and
a
few
persians
at
peter
s
advice
disguised
themselves
as
fishermen
and
rowed
in
then
walked
westward
down
the
canopic
way
and
unbarred
the
gate
of
the
moon
to
the
main
army
their
rule
was
not
cruel
though
they
persecuted
neither
orthodox
christians
nor
copts
for
five
years
heraclius
did
nothing
then
shook
off
his
torpor
and
performed
miracles
marching
against
the
armies
of
the
persians
in
asia
he
defeated
them
and
recovered
the
relic
of
the
true
cross
which
they
had
taken
from
jerusalem
alexandria
and
egypt
were
freed
and
at
the
festival
of
the
exaltation
of
the
coins
commemorate
emperor
appeared
as
the
champion
of
christendom
and
the
greatest
ruler
in
the
world
it
is
unlikely
that
in
the
hour
of
his
triumph
he
paid
any
attention
to
the
envoys
of
an
obscure
arab
sheikh
named
mohammed
who
came
to
congratulate
him
on
his
victory
and
to
suggest
that
he
should
adopt
a
new
religion
called
peace
or
but
he
is
said
to
have
dismissed
them
politely
the
same
sheikh
also
sent
envoys
to
the
imperial
viceroy
at
alexandria
he
too
was
polite
and
sent
back
a
present
that
included
an
ass
a
mule
a
bag
of
money
some
butter
and
honey
and
two
coptic
maidens
one
of
the
latter
mary
became
the
sheikh
s
favourite
concubine
amidst
such
amenities
did
our
intercourse
with
mohammedanism
begin
heraclius
now
at
the
height
of
his
power
and
with
a
mind
now
vigorous
turned
next
to
the
religious
problem
he
desired
that
his
empire
should
be
spiritually
as
it
was
physically
one
and
in
particular
that
the
feud
in
egypt
should
cease
he
was
not
a
bigot
he
believed
in
tolerance
and
sought
a
formula
that
should
satisfy
both
orthodox
and
the
supporters
and
the
opponents
of
the
council
of
chalcedon
a
disastrous
search
he
had
better
have
let
well
alone
the
formula
that
he
so
obscure
that
no
one
could
understand
it
and
the
man
whom
he
chose
as
its
exponent
was
a
cynical
bully
who
did
not
even
wish
that
it
should
be
understood
this
man
was
cyrus
sometimes
called

mukaukas
the

at

realise
it
the
reports
that
cyrus
sent
him
never
told
the
truth
indeed
he
paid
little
attention
to
them
he
was
paralysed
by
a
new
terror
mohammedanism
his
nerve
failed
him
again
as
at
the
persian
invasion
syria
and
the
holy
places
were
again
lost
to
the
empire
this
time
for
ever
broken
in
health
and
spirits
the
emperor
slunk
back
to
constantinople
and
there
shortly
before
he
died
cyrus
arrived
with
the
news
that
egypt
had
been
lost
too
what
happened
was
this
the
arab
general
amr
had
invaded
egypt
with
an
army
of
horse
amr
was
not
only
a
great
general
he
was
an
administrator
a
delightful
companion
and
a
of
the
ablest
and
most
charming
men
that
islam
ever
produced
he
would
have
been
remarkable
in
any
age
he
is
all
the
more
remarkable
in
an
age
that
was
petrified
by
theology
riding
into
egypt
by
the
coast
where
port
said
stands
now
he
struck
swiftly
up
the
nile
defeated
an
imperial
army
at
heliopolis
and
invested
the
fort
of
babylon
cyrus
was
inside
it
his
character
like
the
emperor
s
had
collapsed
he
knew
that
no
native
egyptian
would
resist
the
arabs
and
he
may
have
felt
like
many
of
his
contemporaries
that
christianity
was
doomed
that
its
complexities
were
destined
to
perish
before
the
simplicity
of
islam
he
negotiated
a
peace
which
the
emperor
was
to
ratify
heraclius
was
furious
and
recalled
him
to
constantinople
but
the
mischief
had
been
done
all
egypt
with
the
exception
of
alexandria
had
been
abandoned
to
the
heathen
alexandria
was
surely
safe
in
the
first
place
the
arabs
had
no
ships
and
amr
for
all
his
courage
was
not
the
man
to
build
one
if
a
ship
lies
still
he
writes
it
rends
the
heart
if
it
moves
it
terrifies
the
imagination
upon
it
a
man
s
power
ever
diminishes
and
calamity
increases
those
within
it
are
like
worms
in
a
log
and
if
it
rolls
over
they
are
alexandria
had
nothing
to
fear
on
the
seaward
side
from
such
a
foe
and
on
the
landward
what
could
he
do
against
her
superb
walls
defended
by
all
the
appliances
of
military
science
amr
though
powerful
had
no
artillery
his
was
purely
a
cavalry
force
and
there
was
no
great
alarm
when
from
the
south
east
the
force
was
seen
approaching
and
encamping
somewhere
beyond
the
present
nouzha
gardens
moreover
the
patriarch
cyrus
was
back
and
had
held
a
great
service
in
the
caesareum
and
exhorted
the
christians
to
arms
indeed
it
is
not
easy
to
see
why
alexandria
did
fall
there
was
no
physical
reason
for
it
one
is
almost
driven
to
say
that
she
fell
because
she
had
no
soul
cyrus
for
the
second
time
betrayed
his
trust
he
negotiated
again
with
the
arabs
as
at
babylon
and
signed
an
armistice
with
them
during
which
the
imperial
garrison
evacuated
the
town
amr
did
not
make
hard
terms
cruelty
was
neither
congenial
to
him
nor
politic
those
inhabitants
who
wished
to
leave
might
do
so
the
rest
might
worship
as
they
wished
on
payment
of
tribute
the
following
year
amr
entered
in
triumph
through
the
gate
of
the
sun
that
closed
the
eastern
end
of
the
canopic
way
little
had
been
ruined
so
far
colonnades
of
marble
stretched
before
him
the
tomb
of
alexander
rose
to
his
left
the
pharos
to
his
right
his
sensitive
and
generous
soul
may
have
been
moved
but
the
message
he
sent
to
the
caliph
in
arabia
is
sufficiently
prosaic
i
have
taken
he
writes
a
city
of
which
i
can
only
say
that
it
contains
palaces
baths
theatres
greengrocers
and
and
the
caliph
received
the
news
with
equal
calm
merely
rewarding
the
messenger
with
a
meal
of
bread
and
oil
and
a
few
dates
there
was
nothing
studied
in
this
indifference
the
arabs
could
not
realise
the
value
of
their
prize
they
knew
that
allah
had
given
them
a
large
and
strong
city
they
could
not
know
that
there
was
no
other
like
it
in
the
world
that
the
science
of
greece
had
planned
it
that
it
had
been
the
intellectual
birthplace
of
christianity
legends
of
a
dim
alexander
a
dimmer
cleopatra
might
move
in
their
minds
but
they
had
not
the
historical
sense
they
could
never
realise
what
had
happened
on
this
spot
nor
how
inevitably
the
city
of
the
double
harbour
should
have
arisen
between
the
lake
and
the
sea
and
so
though
they
had
no
intention
of
destroying
her
they
destroyed
her
as
a
child
might
a
watch
she
never
functioned
again
for
over
years
one
or
two
details
are
necessary
to
complete
this
sketch
of
the
conquest
it
had
been
a
humane
affair
and
no
damage
had
been
done
to
property
the
library
which
the
arabs
are
usually
accused
of
destroying
had
already
been
destroyed
by
the
christians
a
few
years
later
however
some
damage
was
done
supported
by
an
imperial
fleet
the
city
revolted
and
amr
was
obliged
to
it
by
force
there
was
a
massacre
which
he
stayed
by
sheathing
his
sword
the
mosque
of
amr
or
of
mercy
was
built
upon
the
site
as
governor
of
egypt
he
administered
it
well
but
his
interests
lay
inland
not
on
the
odious
sea
shore
and
he
founded
a
city
close
to
the
fort
of
the
germ
of
the
modern
cairo
here
all
the
life
of
the
future
was
to
centre
here
amr
himself
was
to
die
as
he
lay
on
his
couch
a
friend
said
to
him
you
have
often
remarked
that
you
would
like
to
find
an
intelligent
man
at
the
point
of
death
and
to
ask
him
what
his
feelings
were
now
i
ask
you
that
amr
replied
i
feel
as
if
the
heaven
lay
close
upon
the
earth
and
i
between
the
two
breathing
through
the
eye
of
a
there
is
something
in
this
dialogue
that
transports
us
into
a
new
world
it
could
never
have
taken
place
between
two
alexandrians
coin

heraclius
showing

museum
room

gate
gate
of

sun
mosque
of
amr
such
were
the
chief
physical
events
in
the
city
during
the
christian
period
we
must
now
turn
back
to
consider
another
and
more
important
aspect
the
spiritual
section
iii
the
spiritual
city
introduction
when
cleopatra
died
and
egypt
became
part
of
the
roman
empire
it
seemed
that
the
career
of
alexandria
was
over
her
life
had
centred
round
the
ptolemies
who
had
adorned
her
with
architecture
and
scholarship
and
song
and
when
they
were
withdrawn
what
remained
she
was
just
a
provincial
capital
but
the
vitality
of
a
city
is
not
thus
measured
there
is
a
splendour
that
kings
do
not
give
and
can
not
take
away
and
just
when
she
lost
her
outward
independence
she
was
recompensed
by
discovering
the
kingdom
that
lies
within
three
sections
of
her
greeks
and
attracted
by
the
same
spiritual
problem
and
tried
to
solve
it
in
the
same
way
it
never
occurred
to
these
alexandrian
thinkers
as
it
had
to
some
of
their
predecessors
in
ancient
greece
that
god
might
not
exist
they
assumed
that
he
existed
what
troubled
them
was
his
relation
to
the
rest
of
the
universe
and
particularly
to
man
was
god
close
to
man
or
was
he
far
away
if
close
how
could
he
be
infinite
and
eternal
and
omnipotent
and
if
far
away
how
could
he
take
any
interest
in
man
why
indeed
should
he
have
troubled
to
create
him
they
wanted
god
to
be
both
far
and
close
savages
solve
such
a
problem
by
having
two
pocket
fetich
whom
they
beat
when
he
irritates
them
and
a
remote
spirit
in
the
sky
and
they
do
not
try
to
think
out
any
connection
between
the
two
the
alexandrians
being
cultivated
could
not
accept
such
crudities
instead
they
assumed
that
between
god
and
man
there
is
an
intermediate
being
or
beings
who
draw
the
universe
together
and
ensure
that
though
god
is
far
he
shall
also
be
close
they
gave
various
names
to
this
intermediate
being
and
ascribed
to
him
varying
degrees
of
dignity
and
power
but
they
became
as
certain
of
his
existence
as
of
god
s
for
in
philosophy
their
temperament
was
mystic
rather
than
scientific
and
as
soon
as
they
hit
on
an
explanation
of
the
universe
that
was
comforting
they
did
not
stop
to
consider
whether
it
might
be
true
after
this
preliminary
let
us
approach
the
three
great
sections
of
alexandrian
thought
i
the
jews
the
the
wisdom
of
with
christ
the
seat
of
the
jews
was
jerusalem
where
they
had
evolved
their
cult
of
jehovah
and
built
him
his
unique
temple
but
as
soon
as
alexandria
was
founded
they
began
to
emigrate
to
the
lucrative
and
seductive
city
and
to
take
up
their
quarters
near
the
modern
ibrahimieh
soon
a
generation
arose
that
was
greek
in
speech
the
hebrew
scriptures
had
to
be
translated
for
their
benefit
and
seventy
the
legend
shut
up
by
ptolemy
philadelphus
in
seventy
huts
on
the
island
of
pharos
whence
they
simultaneously
emerged
with
seventy
identical
translations
of
the
bible
this
was
the
famous
septuagint
as
a
matter
of
fact
over
many
years
and
not
completed
till
but
the
new
generation
was
greek
in
spirit
as
well
as
speech
and
diverged
increasingly
from
the
conservative
jews
at
jerusalem
both
sections
worshipped
jehovah
but
the
alexandrian
grew
more
and
more
conscious
of
the
churlishness
and
inaccessibility
of
his
national
god
thought
mingled
with
his
adoration
how
could
he
link
jehovah
to
man
and
utilising
a
few
hints
in
the
orthodox
scriptures
he
produced
as
his
first
attempt
a
fine
piece
of
literature
called
the
wisdom
of
solomon
it
is
at
present
included
in
the
apocrypha
the
name
is
only
wrote
in
greek
but
had
studied
stoic
and
epicurean
philosophy
and
egyptian
rites
he
had
the
cosmopolitan
culture
of
alexandria
and
solving
his
problem
in
the
alexandrian
way
he
conceived
an
intermediate
between
jehovah
and
man
whom
he
calls
sophia
or
wisdom
wisdom
is
more
moving
than
any
motion
she
goeth
through
all
things
by
reason
of
her
pureness
being
but
one
she
can
do
all
things
and
in
all
ages
entering
into
holy
souls
she
makes
them
friends
of
god
and
prophets
she
is
more
beautiful
than
the
sun
and
all
the
order
of
stars
being
compared
with
the
light
she
is
found
beyond
it
for
after
this
cometh
night
but
vice
shall
not
prevail
against
wisdom
in
such
a
passage
wisdom
is
more
than
being
she
is
a
messenger
who
bridges
the
gulf
and
makes
us
friends
of
god
in
philo
the
jewish
school
of
alexandria
reaches
its
height
little
is
known
of
his
life
his
brother
was
head
of
the
jewish
community
here
and
he
himself
was
sent
on
a
disastrous
embassy
to
the
mad
emperor
caligula
at
rome
being
an
orthodox
jew
he
states
his
philosophic
problem
in
the
language
of
the
old
testament
thus
jehovah
had
said
i
am
that
i
is
to
say
nothing
can
be
predicated
about
god
except
existence
god
has
no
qualities
no
desires
no
form
and
no
home
we
can
not
even
call
god
god
because
god
is
a
word
and
no
word
can
describe
god
while
to
regard
him
as
a
man
is
to
commit
an
error
greater
than
the
god
is
and
no
more
can
be
said
of
him
yet
this
unapproachable
being
has
created
us
how
and
why
through
his
logos
or
word
this
logos
of
philo
is
like
wisdom
a
messenger
who
bridges
the
gulf
he
is
the
outward
expression
of
god
s
existence
he
created
and
he
sustains
the
world
and
philo
uses
the
actual
language
of
devotion
concerning
him
calling
him
israel
the
seer
the
dove
the
dweller
in
the
inmost
which
naturally
recalls
and
possibly
suggested
the
opening
of
john
s
gospel
in
the
beginning
was
the
word
and
the
word
was
with
philo
might
have
written
this
but
he
could
not
have
written
the
word
was
god
nor
the
word
was
made
flesh
for
it
was
as
we
shall
see
the
distinction
of
christianity
to
conceive
that
the
link
between
man
and
god
should
be
himself
both
god
and
man
by
this
doctrine
of
the
logos
philo
made
the
hebrew
jehovah
intelligible
and
acceptable
to
the
alexandrian
jews
it
is
a
doctrine
not
found
in
the
old
testament
and
to
extract
it
he
had
to
employ
allegory
and
to
wrest
words
from
their
natural
meanings
this
gives
his
philosophy
a
frigid
timid
air
and
obscures
its
real
sublimity
only
once
or
twice
does
he
break
loose
and
declare
that
the
path
to
truth
lies
not
through
allegory
but
through
vision
those
who
can
see
he
exclaims
lift
their
eyes
to
heavens
and
contemplate
the
manna
the
divine
logos
those
who
can
not
see
look
at
the
onions
in
the
after
his
death
the
jews
of
alexandria
accomplished
no
more
in
philosophy
they
had
stated
the
problem
the
restatement
was
for
the
greeks
and
the
christians
jewish
inscriptions
from
ibrahimieh
museum
room
ii
plotinus
porphyry
hypatia
the
ptolemies
had
imported
some
greek
philosophers
as
part
of
the
personnel
of
the
mouseion
but
they
were
and
it
was
not
until
the
ptolemies
had
passed
away
and
the
city
herself
was
declining
that
philosophy
took
root
and
bore
the
white
mystic
rose
of
it
developed
out
of
a
doctrine
of
plato
s
six
hundred
years
before
plato
had
taught
at
athens
that
the
world
we
live
in
is
an
imperfect
copy
of
an
ideal
world
he
had
also
taught
other
things
but
this
was
the
doctrine
that
the
new
platonists
of
alexandria
took
up
and
pursued
to
sublime
and
mystic
conclusions
whatever
plato
had
thought
of
this
world
as
a
philosopher
he
had
enjoyed
it
as
a
citizen
and
a
poet
and
has
left
delightful
accounts
of
it
in
his
dialogues
the
were
more
logical
since
this
world
is
imperfect
they
regarded
it
as
negligible
and
excluded
from
their
writings
all
references
to
daily
life
they
might
be
disembodied
spirits
freed
from
locality
and
time
and
it
is
only
after
careful
study
that
we
realise
that
they
too
were
human
that
they
were
typically
alexandrian
and
that
in
them
the
later
city
finds
her
highest
expression
the
school
was
founded
by
ammonius
saccas
who
had
begun
life
as
a
porter
in
the
docks
and
as
a
christian
but
abandoned
both
professions
for
the
study
of
plato
nothing
is
known
of
his
teaching
but
he
produced
great
origen
and
greatest
of
all
plotinus
plotinus
was
probably
born
at
assiout
probably
no
one
could
find
out
for
certain
because
he
was
reticent
about
it
saying
that
the
descent
of
his
soul
into
his
body
had
been
a
great
misfortune
which
he
did
not
desire
to
discuss
he
completed
his
main
training
at
alexandria
and
then
took
part
in
a
military
expedition
against
persia
in
order
to
get
into
touch
with
persian
thought
zoroastrianism
and
with
indian
thought
hinduism
buddhism
he
must
have
made
a
queer
soldier
and
he
was
certainly
an
unsuccessful
one
for
the
expedition
suffered
defeat
and
plotinus
was
very
nearly
relieved
of
the
disgrace
of
having
a
body
escaping
he
made
his
way
to
rome
and
remained
there
until
the
end
of
his
life
lecturing
in
spite
of
his
sincerity
he
became
fashionable
and
the
psychic
powers
that
he
had
acquired
not
only
gained
him
on
four
occasions
the
mystic
vision
which
was
the
goal
of
his
philosophy
but
also
discovered
a
necklace
which
had
been
stolen
from
a
rich
lady
by
one
of
her
slaves
he
was
indifferent
to
literary
composition
after
his
death
his
pupil
porphyry
collected
his
and
published
them
in
nine
the
enneads
are
ill
arranged
and
often
obscure
but
they
contain
a
logical
system
of
thought
some
account
of
which
must
be
produced
nothing
greater
and
they
deal
with
the
usual
alexandrian
linking
up
of
god
and
man
like
philo
and
like
the
christians
plotinus
believes
in
god
and
since
his
god
has
three
grades
we
may
almost
say
that
he
believes
in
a
trinity
but
it
is
very
different
to
the
christian
trinity
and
even
more
difficult
to
understand
the
first
and
highest
grade
in
it
he
calls
the
one
the
one
the
one
nothing
else
can
be
predicated
about
it
not
even
that
it
exists
it
is
more
incomprehensible
than
the
jehovah
of
philo
it
has
no
qualities
no
creative
force
it
is
good
only
as
the
goal
of
our
aspirations
but
though
it
can
not
create
it
overflows
somewhat
like
a
fountain
and
from
its
overflow
or
emanation
is
generated
the
second
grade
of
the
intellectual
the
intellectual
principle
is
a
little
easier
to
understand
than
the
one
because
it
has
a
remote
connection
with
our
lives
it
is
the
universal
mind
that
all
things
but
all
thoughts
of
things
and
by
thinking
it
creates
it
thinks
of
the
third
all
accordingly
comes
into
being
with
the
all
soul
we
near
the
realm
of
the
comprehensible
it
is
the
cause
of
the
universe
that
we
know
all
that
we
grasp
through
the
senses
was
created
by
gods
of
greece
etc
in
the
first
place
then
the
and
demons
then
descending
in
the
scale
ourselves
then
animals
plants
stones
matter
that
seems
so
important
to
us
is
really
the
last
and
feeblest
emanation
of
the
all
soul
the
point
at
which
creative
power
comes
to
a
these
three
grades
the
one
the
intellectual
principle
and
the
all
soul
make
up
between
them
a
single
being
god
who
is
three
in
one
and
one
in
three
and
the
goal
of
all
creation
thus
far
the
system
of
plotinus
may
appear
unattractive
as
well
as
abstruse
we
must
now
look
at
the
other
and
more
emotional
side
not
only
do
all
things
flow
from
god
they
also
strive
to
return
to
him
in
other
words
the
whole
universe
has
an
inclination
towards
good
we
are
all
parts
of
god
even
the
stones
though
we
can
not
realise
it
and
man
s
goal
is
to
become
actually
as
he
is
potentially
divine
therefore
rebirth
is
permitted
in
order
that
we
may
realise
god
better
in
a
future
existence
than
we
can
in
this
and
therefore
the
mystic
vision
is
permitted
in
order
that
even
in
this
existence
we
may
have
a
glimpse
of
god
god
is
ourself
our
true
self
and
in
one
of
the
few
literary
passages
in
the
enneads
the
style
of
plotinus
catches
fire
from
his
thought
and
we
are
taught
in
words
of
immortal
eloquence
how
the
vision
may
be
obtained
but
what
must
we
do
how
lies
the
path
how
come
to
vision
of
the
inaccessible
beauty
dwelling
as
if
in
consecrated
precincts
apart
from
the
common
ways
where
all
men
may
see
let
us
flee
to
the
beloved
this
is
the
soundest
counsel
but
what
is
the
flight
how
are
we
to
gain
the
open
sea
the
fatherland
is
there
whence
we
have
come
and
there
is
the
father
what
then
is
our
course
what
the
manner
of
our
flight
this
is
not
a
journey
for
the
feet
the
feet
bring
us
only
from
land
to
land
all
this
order
of
things
you
must
set
aside
and
refuse
to
see
you
must
close
the
eyes
and
call
instead
upon
another
vision
which
is
to
be
waked
within
you
a
vision
the
of
all
which
few
can
see
withdraw
into
yourself
and
look
and
if
you
do
not
find
yourself
beautiful
yet
act
as
does
the
creator
of
a
statue
that
is
to
be
made
beautiful
he
cuts
away
here
he
smooths
there
he
makes
this
line
lighter
that
purer
until
a
lovely
face
has
grown
upon
his
work
when
you
know
that
you
have
become
this
perfect
work
when
you
are
in
the
purity
of
your
being
nothing
now
remaining
that
can
shatter
that
inner
you
perceive
that
you
have
grown
to
this
you
are
now
become
very
vision
now
call
up
all
your
confidence
strike
forward
yet
a
need
a
guide
no
yet
a
need
a
guide
no
and
see
this
is
the
only
eye
that
sees
the
mighty
beauty
if
the
eye
that
ventures
the
vision
be
dimmed
by
vice
impure
or
weak
then
it
sees
nothing
even
though
another
point
to
what
lies
plain
before
it
to
any
vision
must
be
brought
an
eye
adapted
to
what
is
to
be
seen
and
having
some
resemblance
to
it
never
did
eye
see
the
sun
unless
it
had
first
become
sunlike
and
never
can
the
soul
have
vision
of
the
first
beauty
unless
itself
be
beautiful
footnote
mckenna
s
translation
this
sublime
passage
suggests
three
comments
with
which
our
glance
at
plotinus
must
close
in
the
first
place
its
tone
is
religious
and
in
this
it
is
typical
of
all
alexandrian
philosophy
in
the
second
place
it
lays
stress
on
behaviour
and
training
the
supreme
vision
can
not
be
acquired
by
magic
those
will
see
it
who
are
fit
to
see
and
in
the
third
place
the
vision
of
oneself
and
the
vision
of
god
are
really
the
same
because
each
individual
is
god
if
only
he
knew
it
and
here
is
the
great
difference
between
plotinus
and
christianity
the
christian
promise
is
that
a
man
shall
see
god
the
the
he
shall
be
god
perhaps
on
the
quays
of
alexandria
plotinus
talked
with
hindu
merchants
who
came
to
the
town
at
all
events
his
system
can
be
paralleled
in
the
religious
writings
of
india
he
comes
nearer
than
any
other
greek
philosopher
to
the
thought
of
the
east
porphyry
the
pious
disciple
of
plotinus
was
himself
a
philosopher
of
note
and
the
school
continued
to
flourish
all
through
the
cent
its
main
temper
kept
the
same
it
was
pessimistic
as
regards
the
actual
world
and
actual
men
but
optimistic
as
regards
the
future
because
it
believed
that
the
world
and
all
in
it
has
emanated
from
god
and
has
been
granted
the
means
of
reverting
to
him
it
recognised
the
presence
of
evil
but
not
its
eternal
existence
and
consequently
it
was
a
practical
support
to
its
believers
and
upheld
the
last
of
them

when
i

then

to

an

the
great
tradition
of

expired
at
alexandria
iii
christianity
introduction
percolating
through
the
jewish
communities
the
christian
religion
reached
egypt
as
early
as
the
cent
on
its
arrival
it
found
already
established
there
two
distinct
forms
of
spiritual
life
the
first
was
the
spiritual
life
of
ancient
egypt
which
had
clung
to
the
soil
of
the
nile
valley
for
over
years
it
had
existed
so
long
that
though
christianity
could
close
its
temples
she
never
quite
uprooted
it
from
the
heart
of
the
people
the
resurrection
of
osiris
as
sun
god
the
partaking
of
him
as
corn
god
by
the
blessed
in
the
world
below
the
beneficent
group
of
the
mother
isis
with
horus
her
child
the
same
horus
as
a
young
warrior
slaying
the
snaky
set
the
ankh
that
the
gods
and
goddesses
carried
as
a
sign
of
their
immortality
symbols
had
sunk
too
deeply
into
the
minds
of
the
native
egyptians
to
be
removed
by
episcopal
decrees
consequently
there
were
cases
of
at
menouthis
near
aboukir
in
when
some
villagers
were
discovered
worshipping
the
ancient
deities
in
a
private
house
and
there
were
also
cases
of
confusion
where
the
old
religion
passed
imperceptibly
into
the
new
did
christianity
borrow
from
the
osiris
cult
her
doctrines
of
the
resurrection
and
personal
immortality
and
her
sacrament
of
the
eucharist
the
suggestion
has
been
made
it
is
more
certain
that
she
borrowed
much
of
her
symbolism
and
popular
art
isis
and
horus
become
the
virgin
and
child
horus
and
set
george
and
the
dragon
while
the
ankh
appears
unaltered
on
some
of
the
christian
tomb
stones
as
a
looped
cross
and
slightly
altered
on
others
as
a
cross
with
a
handle
the
second
form
of
spiritual
life
was
the
life
of
alexandria
its
quality
mainly
hellenic
and
philosophic
has
already
been
indicated
christianity
to
begin
with
was
not
philosophic
being
addressed
to
poor
and
unfashionable
people
in
palestine
but
as
soon
as
it
reached
alexandria
its
character
altered
the
turning
point
in
its
worldly
career
arrived
the
alexandrians
were
highly
cultivated
they
had
libraries
where
all
the
wisdom
of
the
mediterranean
was
accessible
and
their
faith
inevitably
took
a
philosophic
form
occupied
by
their
favourite
problem
of
the
relation
between
god
and
man
they
at
once
asked
the
same
question
of
the
new
religion
as
they
asked
the
jews
and
the
what
is
the
link
philo
said
the
logos
plotinus
the
emanations
the
new
religion
replied
there
was
nothing
startling
to
the
alexandrians
in
such
a
reply
christ
too
was
the
word
he
too
proceeded
from
the
father
his
incarnation
his
redemption
of
mankind
through
these
were
not
strange
ideas
to
people
who
were
accustomed
to
divine
kings
and
familiar
with
the
myths
of
prometheus
and
adonis
alexandrian
orthodoxy
alexandrian
heresies
both
centred
round
the
problem
that
was
familiar
to
alexandrian
relation
between
god
and
man
thus
christianity
did
not
burst
upon
egypt
or
upon
alexandria
like
a
clap
of
thunder
but
stole
into
ears
already
prepared
neither
on
her
popular
nor
on
her
philosophic
side
was
she
a
creed
apart
only
politically
did
she
stand
out
as
an
innovator

her
denial
of
divinity

gnosticism
taught
that
the
world
and
mankind
are
the
result
of
an
unfortunate
blunder
god
neither
created
us
nor
wished
us
to
be
created
we
are
the
work
of
an
inferior
deity
the
demiurge
who
wrongly
believes
himself
god
and
we
are
doomed
to
decay
but
god
though
not
responsible
for
our
existence
took
pity
on
it
and
has
sent
his
christ
to
counteract
the
ignorance
of
the
demiurge
and
to
give
us
gnosis
knowledge
christ
is
the
link
between
the
divine
and
that
unfortunate
mistake
the
human
the
individual
gnostics
played
round
this
idea
cerinthus
educated
here
taught
that
jesus
was
a
man
and
christ
a
spirit
who
left
him
at
death
basilides
a
syrian
visitor
that
there
were
three
dispensations
jewish
and
christian
each
of
whose
rulers
had
a
son
which
son
comprehended
more
of
god
than
did
his
father
the
ophites
worshipped
snakes
because
the
serpent
in
eden
was
really
a
messenger
from
god
who
induced
eve
to
disobey
the
demiurge
jehovah
consequently
if
we
wish
to
be
good
we
must
be
conclusion
that
was
also
reached
though
by
a
different
route
by
carpocrates
who
organised
an
abode
of
love
on
one
of
the
greek
islands
these
are
unsavoury
charlatans
but
one
of
the
a
man
of
another
stamp
and
his
system
has
a
tragic
quality
most
rare
in
alexandria
valentinus
probably
an
egyptian
educated
here
taught
mainly
at
rome
held
the
usual
gnostic
doctrine
that
creation
is
a
mistake
but
he
tried
to
explain
how
the
mistake
came
about
he
imagines
a
primal
god
the
centre
of
a
divine
harmony
who
sent
out
manifestations
of
himself
in
pairs
of
male
and
female
each
pair
was
inferior
to
its
predecessor
and
sophia
wisdom
the
female
of
the
thirtieth
pair
least
perfect
of
all
she
showed
her
imperfection
not
like
lucifer
by
rebelling
from
god
but
by
desiring
too
ardently
to
be
united
to
him
she
fell
through
love
hurled
from
the
divine
harmony
she
fell
into
matter
and
the
universe
is
formed
out
of
her
agony
and
remorse
she
herself
was
rescued
by
the
first
christ
but
not
before
she
had
born
a
son
the
demiurge
who
rules
this
world
of
sadness
and
confusion
and
is
incapable
of
realising
anything
beyond
it
in
this
world
there
are
three
classes
of
men
all
outwardly
the
same
men
of
the
body
the
spirit
and
the
soul
the
first
two
belong
to
the
demiurge
and
ought
to
obey
him
the
third
are
really
the
elect
of
his
mother
sophia
he
rules
them
but
can
not
make
them
obey
it
was
for
their
salvation
that
the
christ
whom
we
call
jesus
descended
straight
from
the
primal
god
and
left
with
his
twelve
disciples
the
secret
tradition
of
the
gnosis
with
valentinus
the
gnosticism
of
alexandria
reaches
its
height
further
east
it
took
other
forms
it
had
spread
by
all
round
the
mediterranean
and
threatened
to
defeat
orthodox
christianity
but
it
was
pessimistic
imaginative
great
obstacles
to
success
it
was
not
a
creed
any
society
could
adopt
being
and
by
the
time
of
constantine
its
vogue
was
over
gnostic
amulets
museum
room
ii
orthodoxy
early
clement
of
orthodoxy
at
alexandria
did
not
begin
on
clear
cut
lines
indeed
the
more
we
look
at
it
the
more
it
melts
into
its
surroundings
it
adapted
from
philo
his
doctrine
of
the
logos
and
identified
the
logos
with
christ
it
shared
with
gnosticism
the
desire
for
knowledge
of
god
while
declaring
that
such
knowledge
need
not
be
esoteric
it
has
its
special
mark
other
gospels
since
condemned
as
uncanonical
were
equally
read
in
its
churches
the
gospels
of
the
hebrews
and
of
the
egyptians
it
was
permeated
by
greek
became
christians
and
but
one
distinguishing
doctrine
it
did
supreme
value
of
christ
christ
was
the
word
incarnate
through
whom
the
love
and
power
of
god
could
alone
be
problems
as
to
christ
s
nature
did
not
trouble
the
earlier
theologians
their
impulse
was
to
testify
not
to
analyse
a
feeling
of
joy
inspires
their
interminable
writings
and
it
is
possible
to
detect
through
their
circumlocution
the
faith
that
steeled
the
martyrs
their
contemporaries
clement
of
alexandria
probably
a
greek
from
athens
was
head
of
the
big
theological
college
here
his
problem
like
that
of
the
jews
before
him
was
to
recommend
his
religion
to
a
subtle
and
philosophic
city
and
his
methods
forestall
those
of
the
advanced
missionary
he
does
not
denounce
greek
philosophy
his
line
is
that
it
is
a
preparation
for
the
gospel
that
the
jewish
law
was
also
a
preparation
and
that
all
that
happened
before
the
birth
of
christ
is
indeed
a
divine
approach
to
that
supreme
event
learned
and
enlightened
he
set
christianity
upon
a
path
that
she
did
not
long
consent
to
follow
he
raised
her
from
intellectual
obscurity
he
lent
her
for
a
little
hellenic
persuasion
and
the
graciousness
of
greece
seems
in
his
pages
not
incompatible
with
the
grace
of
god
he
is
the
greatest
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
who
shall
do
and
teach
in
imitation
of
god
by
showing
free
grace
like
his
for
the
bounties
of
god
are
for
the
common
benefits
only
in
alexandria
could
such
a
theologian
have
arisen
his
work
was
carried
on
by
his
pupil
origen
the
strangest
and
most
adventurous
of
the
early
fathers
gentle
and
scholarly
by
nature
origen
had
an
instinct
for
that
troubled
his
life
and
the
lives
of
his
friends
he
was
an
egyptian
the
name
is
connected
with
horus
and
he
was
born
here
of
christian
parents
and
tried
as
a
boy
to
share
his
father

martyrdom
at
the
temple
of
serapis
calmed
for
a
while
he
supported
his
mother
and
brothers
and
was
fellow
pupil
with
plotinus
then
he
became
head
of
the
theological
college
and
having
attained
fame
as
a
teacher
and
lay
preacher
castrated
himself
a
eunuch
for
the
kingdom
of

s
xix
his
patron
the
bishop
of
alexandria
disowned
him
for
this
and
ruled
that
he
could
not
now
take
orders
other
bishops
declared
that
he
could
and
the
christian
communities
were
divided
by
the
grotesque
controversy
origen
was
considerate
and
even
repentant
he
had
no
wish
to
cause
scandal
and
when
ordered
to
leave
alexandria
he
obeyed
but
his
opinions
ever
verged
towards
the
incorrect
he
believed
like
plotinus
in
he
disbelieved
in
the
eternity
of
punishment
and
it
is
with
the
greatest
hesitation
that
orthodoxy
has
received
him
to
her
bosom
in
the
main
he
developed
the
theory
of
his
master
christianity
is
the
heir
of
the
past
and
the
interpreter
of
the
future
he
taught
that
christ
has
been
with
mankind
not
only
at
his
incarnation
but
since
the
beginning
of
creation
and
has
in
all
ages
linked
them
according
to
their
capacity
with
god
thus
the
characteristic
of
early
orthodoxy
was
a
belief
in
christ
as
the
link
between
god
and
man
a
humanising
belief
the
work
of
the
greek
scholars
who
had
subtilised
and
universalised
the
simpler
faith
of
palestine
and
had
imparted
into
it
doctrines
taught
by
paganism
we
must
now
watch
it
harden
and
transform
several
causes
transformed
the
growth
of
an
ignorant
monasticism
in
egypt
the
growth
in
northern
africa
of
a
gloomier
type
of
christianity
under
tertullian
and
the
general
spirit
of
aggression
the
new
religion
everywhere
displayed
as
soon
as
constantine
labelled
it
as
official
but
there
was
one
cause
that
was
inherent
in
the
belief
itself
and
that
alone
concerns
us
here
christ
was
the
son
of
god
all
agreed
but
what
was
the
of
christ
the
subtle
alexandrian
intellect
asked
this
question
about
the
year
and
the
arian
heresy
was
the
result
it
asked
it
again
about
and
produced
the
monophysite
heresy
and
a
third
query
about
produced
a
third
heresy
the
monothelite
let
us
glance
at
these
three
in
turn
heresies
to
others
they
were
of
course

in
their
own

arianism
christ
is
the
son
of
god
then
is
he
not
younger
than
god
arius
held
that
he
was
and
that
there
was
a
period
before
time
began
when
the
first
person
of
the
trinity
existed
and
the
second
did
not
a
typical
alexandrian
theologian
occupied
with
the
favourite
problem
of
linking
human
and
divine
arius
thought
to
solve
the
problem
by
making
the
link
predominately
human
he
did
not
deny
the
godhead
of
christ
but
he
did
make
him
inferior
to
the
substance
not
of
the
substance
which
was
the
view
held
by
athanasius
and
stamped
as
orthodox
by
the
council
of
nicaea
moreover
the
arian
christ
like
the
gnostic
demiurge
made
the
world
an
inferior
activity
being
entrusted
to
him
by
the
father
who
had
himself
created
nothing
but
christ
it
is
easy
to
see
why
arianism
became
popular
by
making
christ
younger
and
lower
than
god
it
brought
him
nearer
to
it
tended
to
level
him
into
a
mere
good
man
and
to
forestall
unitarianism
it
appealed
to
the
untheologically
minded
to
emperors
and
even
more
to
empresses
but
athanasius
who
viewed
the
innovation
with
an
expert
eye
saw
that
while
it
popularised
christ
it
isolated
god
and
he
fought
it
with
vigour
and
venom
his
success
has
been
described
it
was
condemned
as
heretical
in
and
by
the
end
of
the
century
had
been
expelled
from
orthodox
christendom
of
the
theatre
of
this
ancient
strife
no
trace
remains
at
alexandria
the
church
of
mark
where
arius
was
presbyter
has
vanished
so
have
the
churches
where
athanasius
theonas
and
the
caesareum
nor
do
we
know
in
which
street
arius
died
of
epilepsy
but
the
strife
still
continues
in
the
hearts
of
men
who
always
tend
to
magnify
the
human
in
the
divine
and
it
is
probable
that
many
an
individual
christian
is
an
arian
without
knowing

is

also
the

then
has

two
natures
or
one
the
monophysites
said
they
did
not
deny
christ
s
incarnation
but
they
asserted
that
the
divine
in
him
had
quite
absorbed
the
human
the
question
was
first
raised
in
clerical
circles
in
constantinople
but
alexandria
took
it
up
hotly
and
single
nature
became
the
national
cry
of
egypt
we
have
already
seen
the
political
importance
of
this
heresy
how
it
was
connected
with
a
racial
movement
against
the
greeks
how
when
it
was
condemned
at
chalcedon
egypt
slipped
into
permanent
mutiny
against
the
empire
the
council
announced
that
christ
had
two
natures
unmixed
and
unchangeable
but
at
the
same
time
indistinguishable
and
inseparable
this
is
the
orthodox
one
we
hold
the
copts
and
abyssinians
are
still
monophysites
and
consequently
not
in

monothelism
single
as
the
minds
of
the
alexandrians

their
heresies
became
more

technical
arianism
enshrines
a
real
problem
which
the
layman
as
well
as
the
cleric
can
apprehend
monophysism
is
more
remote
and
monothelism
is
difficult
to
state
in
the
language
of
theology
and
almost
impossible
to
state
in
the
language
of
common
sense
perhaps
it
bears
in
it
the
signs
of
carelessness
for
as
we
have
seen
it
was
the
invention
of
the
emperor
heraclius
in
the
last
desperate
days
when
he
was
trying
to
conciliate
egypt
if
christ
has
one
nature
he
has
of
course
one
will
but
suppose
he
has
two
natures
how
many
wills
has
he
then
the
monothelites
said
the
orthodox
one
we
two
one
human
the
other
divine
but
both
operating
in
obscure
indeed
is
the
problem
and
we
can
well
believe
that
the
alexandrians
against
whom
the
arabs
were
then
marching
did
not
understand
monothelism
when
it
was
hurriedly
explained
to
them
by
a
preoccupied
general
but
it
was
not
without
a
future
it
failed
as
a
compromise
but
survived
as
a
heresy
and
long
after
the
imperial
government
had
disowned
it
and
egypt
had
fallen
to
islam
it
was
cherished
in
the
uplands
of
syria
by
the
maronite
church

we
have
now
seen
alexandria
handle
one
after
another
the
systems
that
entered
her
walls
the
ancient
religion
of
the
hebrews
the
philosophy
of
plato
the
new
faith
out
of
each
in
turn
she
has
left
her
impress
upon
it
and
extracted
some
answer
to
her
question
how
can
the
human
be
linked
to
the
divine
it
may
be
argued
that
this
question
must
be
asked
by
all
who
have
the
religious
sense
and
that
there
is
nothing
specifically
alexandrian
about
it
but
no
it
need
not
be
asked
it
was
never
asked
by
islam
by
the
faith
that
swept
the
city
physically
and
spiritually
into
the
sea
there
is
no
god
but
god
and
mohammed
is
the
prophet
of
god
says
islam
proclaiming
the
needlessness
of
a
mediator
the
man
mohammed
has
been
chosen
to
tell
us
what
god
is
like
and
what
he
wishes
and
there
all
machinery
ends
leaving
us
to
face
our
creator
we
face
him
as
a
god
of
power
who
may
temper
his
justice
with
mercy
but
who
does
not
stoop
to
the
weakness
of
love
and
we
are
well
content
that
being
powerful
he
shall
be
far
away
that
old
dilemma
that
god
ought
at
the
same
time
to
be
far
away
and
close
at
hand
can
not
occur
to
an
orthodox
mohammedan
it
occurs
to
those
who
require
god
to
be
loving
as
well
as
powerful
to
christianity
and
to
its
kindred
growths
and
it
is
the
weakness
and
the
strength
of
alexandria
to
have
solved
it
by
the
conception
of
a
link
her
weakness
because
she
had
always
to
be
shifting
the
link
up
and
she
got
it
too
near
god
it
was
too
far
from
man
and
her
strength
because
she
did
cling
to
the
idea
of
love
and
much
philosophic
absurdity
much
theological
aridity
must
be
pardoned
to
those
who
maintain
that
the
best
thing
on
earth
is
likely
to
be
the
best
in
heaven
islam

through
its
abjuration
of

the
one
system
that
the

the

could

change
was
in

when

of
mariout
being
no

cut
off
from
the

could
not
flourish

was
restored

was

the

connect
the

into

and

along
which
a
broad
spit
of

accreted

so
pharos
turned
from
an
island
into
a
present
the
arabs
though
they
let
the
city
fall
out
of
repair
admired
it
greatly
one
of
them
writes
as
follows
the
city
was
all
white
and
bright
by
night
as
well
as
by
day
by
reason
of
the
walls
and
pavements
of
white
marble
the
people
used
to
wear
black
garments
it
was
the
glare
of
the
marble
that
made
the
monks
wear
black
so
too
it
was
painful
to
go
out
by
night
a
tailor
could
see
to
thread
his
needle
without
a
lamp
no
one
entered
without
a
covering
over
his

a

writer
describes
the
green
silk
awnings
that
were
spread
over
the
canopic
way
a
third
even
more
enthusiastic
exclaims
i
have
made
the
pilgrimage

mecca
sixty
times

if
allah
had
suffered
me
to
stay
a
month
at
alexandria
and
pray
on

shores
that
month
would
be
dearer
to
me
the
arabs
were
anything
but
barbarians
their
own
great
city
of
cairo
is
a
sufficient
answer
to
that
charge
but
their
civilisation
was
oriental
and
of

it
was
out

napoleon
on

the
inhabitants
of

saw
that
the
deserted

was
covered
with
an
immense
fleet
three
hundred
sailing
ships
came
out
from

to
anchor
off

men
disembarked
all
night
and
by
the
middle
of
next
day
french
soldiers
under
napoleon
had
occupied
the
place
they
were
part
of
a
larger
force
and
had
come
under
the
pretence
of
helping
turkey
against
whom
egypt
was
then
having
one
of
her
feeble
and
periodic
revolts
the
future
emperor
was
still
a
mere
general
of
the
french
republic
but
already
an
influence
on
politics
and
this
expedition
was
his
own
plan
he
was
in
love
with
the
east
just
then
the
romance
of
the
nile
valley
had
touched
his
imagination
and
he
knew
that
it
was
the
road
to
an
even
greater
at
war
with
england
he
saw
himself
gaining
at
england
s
expense
an
oriental
realm
and
reviving
the
power
of
alexander
the
great
in
him
as
in
mark
antony
alexandria
nourished
imperial
dreams
the
expedition
failed
but
its
memory
remained
with
him
he
had
touched
the
east
the
nursery
of
kings
leaving
alexandria
at
once
he
marched
on
cairo
and
won
the
battle
of
the
pyramids
then
an
irreparable
disaster
befel
him
he
had
left
his
admiral
brueys
with
instructions
to
dispose
the
fleet
as
safely
as
possible
since
nelson
was
known
to
be
in
pursuit
under
modern
conditions
brueys
would
have
sailed
into
the
western
harbour
but
in
the
reefs
that
cross
the
entrance
had
not
been
blasted
away
and
though
the
transports
got
in
the
passages
were
rather
dangerous
for
the
big
brueys
was
nervous
and
thought
he
had
better
take
them
round
to
an
anchorage
supposed
impeccable
in
the
bay
of
aboukir
nelson
followed
him
attacked
him
unexpectedly
and
destroyed
his
fleet
details

this
famous
engagement

the

are
given
in

its
result
was
to
lose
for
napoleon
the
command
of
the
sea
the
french
expedition
took
cairo
and
remained
powerful
on
land
but
could
receive
no
reinforcements
no
messages
and
withered
away
like
a

that
has
been
cut
at
the
root
turkey
declared
against
it
and
a
turkish
force
supported
by
british
ships
landed
at
aboukir
july
here
napoleon
was
successful
he
commanded
in
person
and
in
a
series
of
brilliant
engagements
drove
the
invaders
into
the
sea
this
is
the
land
battle
of
aboukir
described
in
detail
but
his
dreams
had
been
shattered
by
nelson
he
saw
that
his
destiny
whatever
it
was
would
not
be
accomplished
in
the
east
and
meanly
deserting
his
army
he
slipped
back
to
france
we
now
come
to
the
first
british
expedition
and
to
its
successful
and
interesting
campaign
in
march
sir
ralph
abercrombie
landed
with
men
at
aboukir
his
aim
was
not
to
occupy
egypt
but
to
induce
the
french
armies
to
evacuate
it
he
marched
westward
against
alexandria
keeping
close
to
the
sea
the
country
on
his
left
was
very
different
to
what
it
is
now
and
to
understand
his
operations
two
of
the
differences
must
be
remembered
i
the
lake
of
aboukir
since
drained
stretched
from
aboukir
bay
almost
as
far
as
ramleh
as
it
connected
with
the
sea
it
was
full
of
salt
water
ii
the
present
lake
mariout
was
almost
dry
it
contained
a
little
fresh
water
but
most
of
its
enormous
bed
was
under
cultivation
it
lay
twelve
feet
below
the
waters
of
lake
aboukir
and
was
protected
from
them
by
a
dyke
thus
abercrombie
saw
water
where
we
see
land
and
he
advanced
with
success
as
far
as
mandourah
because
his
left
flank
was
protected
by
lake
aboukir
but
when
he
wanted
to
attack
the
french
position
at
ramleh
he
feared
they
would
outflank
him
over
the
dry
bed
of
mariout
his
losses
had
been
heavy
his
advance
was
held
up
wounded
in
the
thigh
by
a
musket
shot
he
had
to
abandon
the
command
and
was
carried
on
to
a
boat
where
he
died
a
small
monument
at
sidi
gaber
commemorates
him
his
successor
hutchinson
took
drastic
measures
at
the
advice
of
his
engineers
he
cut
the
dyke
that
separated
lake
aboukir
from
mariout
the
salt
water
rushed
in
to
the
delight
of
the
british
soldiers
and
in
a
month
thousands
of
acres
had
been
drowned
alexandria
was
isolated
from
the
rest
of
egypt
and
the
left
flank
of
the
expedition
was
protected
all
the
way
up
to
the
walls
of
the
town
later
in
the
year
a
second
british
force
landed
to
the
west
of
alexandria
at
marabout
and
caught
between
two
fires
the
french
were
obliged
to
surrender
they
were
given
easy
terms
and
allowed
to
leave
egypt
with
all
the
honours
of
war
the
british
followed
them
we
had
accomplished
our
aim
and
had
no
reason
to
remain
in
the
country
any
longer
we
left
it
to
our
allies
the
turks
but
the
sleep
of
so
many
centuries
had
been
broken
the
eyes
of
europe
were
again
directed
to
the
deserved
shore
though
napoleon
had
failed
and
the
british
had
retired
a
new
age
had
begun
for
alexandria
life

among
the
fugitives
was
mohammed
ali
the
founder
of
the
present
reigning
house
of
egypt
little
is
known
of
his
origin
he
was
an
albanian
but
born
at
cavala
in
macedonia
where
he
is
said
to
have
distinguished
himself
as
a
tax
collector
in
his
earlier
youth
his
education
was
primitive
he
was
ignorant
of
history
and
economics
and
only
learnt
the
arabic
alphabet
late
in
life
but
he
was
a
man
of
great
ability
and
power
and
an
acute
judge
of
character
he
reappears
in
egypt
in
still
obscure
and
fights
under
abercrombie
when
the
english
withdrew
he
profited
by
the
internal
disturbances
and
became
in
viceroy
of
the
country
under
the
sultan
of
turkey
his
power
was
consolidated
by
the
disastrous
british
expedition
of
frazer
s
reconnoitering
expedition
as
it
is
officially
termed
england
was
hostile
to
turkey
now
and
frazer
was
sent
to
see
whether
a
diversion
could
be
created
in
egypt
he
landed
like
napoleon
before
him
at
marabout
but
with
no
more
than
the
following
regiments
the
the
and
a
foreign
legion
men
in
all
he
occupied
alexandria
and
rosetta
but
before
long
mohammed
ali
had
killed
or
captured
half
his
force
and
he
was
obliged
to
ask
for
terms
they
were
readily
granted
the
reconnoitering
expedition
was
allowed
to
reembark
and
the
only
trace
it
has
left
of
its
presence
in
alexandria
is
a
tombstone
of
a
soldier
of
the
in
the
courtyard
of
the
greek
patriarchate
for
thirty
years
the
power
of
mohammed
ali
grew
and
with
it
the
importance
of
alexandria
his
virtual
capital
he
freed
the
holy
places
of
arabia
from
a
heretical
sect
he
interfered
in
greece
he
revolted
against
his
suzerain
the
sultan
of
turkey
and
invading
syria
added
it
to
his
dominions
a
kingdom
comparable
in
extent
to
the
ptolemaic
had
come
into
existence
with
alexandria
as
its
centre
and
it
seemed
that
the
dreams
of
napoleon
would
be
realised
by
this
albanian
adventurer
and
that
the
english
would
be
cut
off
from
india
england
took
alarm
and
suddenly
the
empire
of
mohammed
ali
fell
syria
revolted
supported
by
a
british
fleet
and
soon
the
english
admiral
sir
charles
napier
was
at
alexandria
and
compelled
the
viceroy
to
confine
himself
to
egypt
according
to
tradition
the
interview
took
place
in
the
new
palace
and
napier
exclaims
if
your
highness
will
not
listen
to
my
unofficial
appeal
to
you
against
the
folly
of
further
resistance
it
only
remains
for
me
to
bombard
you
and
by
god
i
will
bombard
you
and
plant
my
bombs

middle

you
are

mohammed
ali
gave
in
he
had
failed
as
a
european
power
but
he
had
secured
for
his
family
a
comfortable
principality
in
egypt
where
he
was
king
in
all
but
name
his
internal
policy
was
rather
disreputable
he
admired
european
civilization
because
it
made
people
aggressive
and
gave
them
guns
but
he
had
no
sense
of
its
finer
aspects
and
his
reforms
were
mainly
veneer
to
impress
travellers
he
exploited
the
fellahin
by
buying
grain
from
them
at
his
own
price
the
whole
of
egypt
became
his
private
farm
hence
the
importance
of
the
foreign
communities
at
alexandria
at
this
date
he
needed
their
aid
to
dispose
of
the
produce
in
european
markets
he
won
over
the
british
and
other
consuls
to
be
his
agents
by
giving
them
licences
to
export
egyptian
antiquities
which
were
then
coming
into
fashion
our
own
consul
henry
tomb
is
a
particular
offender
in
this
he
also
gave
away
cleopatra
s
needles
to
the
british
and
american
governments
respectively
the
obelisks
that
still
remained
on
their
original
sites
outside
the
vanished
caesareum
and
would
have
lent
such
dignity
to
our
modern
sea
front
still
with
all
his
faults
he
did
create
the
modern
city
such
as
she
is
he
waved
his
wand
and
what
we
see
arose
from
the
aged
soil
let
us
examine
it
for
a
moment
statue
of
mohammed

his

the
modern
city
during
the
years
as
many
as
four
expeditions
had
landed
at
or
near
french
one
turkish
and
two
english
egypt
had
again
been
drawn
into
the
european
system
a
maritime
capital
was
necessary
and
the
genius
of
mohammed
ali
realised
that
it
could
be
found
not
in
the
mediaeval
ports
of
damietta
and
rosetta
but
in
a
restored
alexandria
the
city
that
we
know
has
followed
the
lines
that
he
laid
down
and
it
is
interesting
to
compare
his
dispositions
with
those
of
alexander
the
great
over
two
thousand
years
before
the
main
problem
was
the
waters
the
english
by
cutting
the
dykes
in
had
refilled
lake
mariout
so
that
it
had
suddenly
regained
its
ancient
area
but
it
was
too
shallow
for
navigation
and
they
had
filled
it
with
salt
water
instead
of
the
former
fresh
it
gave
no
access
to
the
system
of
the
nile
that
system
had
to
be
tapped
alexander
could
find
the
nile
at
aboukir
canopic
mouth
now
it
was
as
far
off
as
rosetta
ancient
bolbitic
mouth
consequently
mohammed
ali
had
to
construct
a
canal
miles
long
this
canal
called
the
mahmoudieh
after
mahmoud
the
reigning
sultan
of
turkey
was
completed
in
it
was
badly
made
and
the
sides
were
always
falling
in
but
it
led
to
the
immediate
rise
of
alexandria
and
to
the
decay
of
rosetta
alexandria
now
had
water
communications
with
cairo
to
which
was
added
communication
by
rail
the
harbour
followed
mohammed
ali
developed
the
western
which
had
been
the
less
important
in
classical
times
the
present
docks
and
arsenals
were
built
for
him
by
the
french
engineer
de
cerisy
a
fleet
was
added
to
the
same
scheme
belongs
the
impressive
palace
which
standing
on
a
rise
above
the
harbour
dominated
it
as
the
ptolemaic
palace
had
once
dominated
the
eastern
the
favourite
residence
of
the
viceroy
it
indicated
that
his
new
kingdom
was
no
mere
oriental
monarchy
but
a
modern
power
with
its
face
to
the
sea
meanwhile
the
town
started
its
development
but
not
on
very
regal
lines
houses
began
to
run
up
and
streets
to
sprawl
over
the
deserted
area
inside
the
arab
walls
it
did
not
occur
either
to
mohammed
ali
or
to
his
friends
the
foreign
communities
that
a
city
ought
to
be
planned
their
one
achievement
was
a
square
and
certainly
quite
a
fine
place
des
consuls
now
place
mohammed
ali
the
english
were
granted
land
to
the
north
of
the
square
on
part
of
which
they
built
their
church
the
french
and
the
greeks
land
to
the
south
areas
were
also
acquired
by
other
communities
by
the
armenians
but
there
was
no
attempt
to
coordinate
the
various
enterprises
or
to
utilise
the
existing
features
of
the
site
these
features
were
the
sea
the
lake
pompey
s
pillar
the
forts
of
and
cafarelli
and
the
arab
walls
the
sea
was
ignored
except
for
commercial
purposes
the
main
thoroughfares
still
keep
away
from
its
shores
and
even
the
fine
new
quays
are
attracting
no
buildings
to
their
curve
the
lake
was
ignored
even
more
lake
whose
delicate
pale
expanse
might
so
have
beautified
the
southern
quarters
many
people
do
not
know
that
a
lake
exists
pompey
s
pillar
instead
of
being
the
centre
of
converging
roads
has
been
left
where
it
will
least
be
seen
only
down
the
rue
bab
sidra
does
one
get
a
distant
view
of
it
similarly
with
the
two
forts
huddled
behind
houses
the
arab
walls
have
been
finally
surviving
in
the
eastern
reach
where
they
have
been
utilised
and
well
utilised
in
the
public
gardens
as
alexandria
grew
in
size
and
wealth
she
required
suburbs
the
earliest
development
was
along
the
line
of
the
mahmoudieh
canal
where
the
villa
antoniadis
and
a
few
other
fine
houses
have
been
built
but
with
the
improvement
of
communications
the
rich
merchants
were
able
to
live
further
afield
two
alternatives
were
open
to
and
rather
regrettably
they
selected
the
latter
mex
with
its
fine
natural
features
might
have
developed
into
a
very
beautiful
place
as
it
is
a
belt
of
slums
have
parted
it
from
the
town
and
an
execrable
tram
service
has
removed
it
even
further
the
town
has
spread
to
the
east
instead
to
ramleh
served
at
first
by
a
railway
and
now
by
good
electric
trams
such
are
the
main
features
of
alexandria
as
it
has
evolved
under
mohammed
ali
and
his
successors
it
does
not
compare
favourably
with
the
city
of
alexander
the
great
on
the
other
hand
it
is
no
worse
than
most
nineteenth
century
cities
and
it
has
one
immense
advantage

that
anything
of
note
occurs

is
in

with

of

was
endeavouring
to
dominate

to
secure

held
a

element

therefore
his
natural
foe

it
was
here
that
he
opened

campaign
against

ended
in
his
failure
at
the
arabi
s
complicated
but
four
stages
may
be
observed
i
of
june
this
began
at
about
in
the
rue
des
soeurs
it
is
said
that
two
donkey
boys
one
arab
and
one
maltese
had
a
fight
in
a
café
and
that
others
joined
in
the
rioters
moved
down
towards
the
square
and
at
some
cross
roads
near
the
laban
caracol
the
british
consul
was
nearly
killed
they
were
joined
in
the
square
by
two
other
mobs
one
from
the
attarine
quarter
and
one
from
british
and
other
warships
were
in
the
harbour
but
took
no
action
and
the
egyptian
troops
in
the
city
refused
to
intervene
without
orders
from
arabi
who
was
in
cairo
at
last
a
telegram
was
sent
to
him
he
responded
and
the
disorder
ceased
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
he
planned
the
riot
but
naturally
enough
he
used
it
to
increase
his
prestige
he
had
shown
the
foreign
communities
and
particularly
the
british
that
he
alone
could
give
them
protection
in
the
evening
he
came
down
in
triumph
from
cairo
about
europeans
are
thought
to
have
been
killed
that
day
but
we
have
no
reliable
statistics
ii
of
july
british
under
admiral
seymour
had
been
in
the
harbour
during
the
riot
but
it
was
a
month
before
they
took
action
in
the
first
place
the
british
residents
had
to
be
removed
in
the
second
the
fleet
required
reinforcing
in
the
third
orders
were
awaited
from
home
as
soon
as
seymour
was
ready
he
picked
a
quarrel
with
arabi
and
declared
he
should
bombard
the
city
if
any
more
guns
were
mounted
in
the
forts
since
arabi
would
not
agree
he
opened
fire
at
july
there
were
eight
of
them
the
most
powerful
in
our
navy
they
were
thus
distributed
and
close
inshore
off
mex
and
off
while
the
two
others
the
and
were
in
a
central
position
outside
the
harbour
reef
between
and
marabout
and
off
marabout
were
some
gun
boats
under
lord
charles
beresford
the
bombardment
succeeded
though
arabi
s
gunners
in
the
forts
fought
bravely
in
the
evening
the
blew
up
the
powder
magazine
in
fort
adda
fort
kait
bey
was
also
shattered
and
the
minaret
of
its
cent
mosque
was
seen
melting
away
like
ice
in
the
the
town
on
the
other
hand
was
scarcely
damaged
as
our
gunners
were
careful
in
their
aim
arabi
and
his
force
evacuated
it
in
the
evening
marching
out
by
the
rue
rosette
to
take
up
a
position
some
miles
further
east
on
the
banks
of
the
mahmoudieh
canal
iii
of
july
unfortunately
admiral
seymour
after
his
success
never
landed
a
force
to
keep
order
and
the
result
was
a
riot
far
more
disastrous
than
that
of
june
with
the
withdrawal
of
arabi
s
troops
the
native
population
lost
self
control
the
khedive
had
now
broken
with
arabi
but
during
the
bombardment
he
had
moved
from
palace
to
ramleh
and
his
authority
was
negligible
pillaging
went
on
all
day
on
the
and
by
the
evening
the
city
had
been
set
on
fire
the
damage
was
material
rather
than
artistic
the
one
valuable
object
in
the
square
the
statue
of
mohammed
ali
fortunately
escaping
rues
chérif
and
tewfik
all
the
roads
leading
out
of
the
destroyed
and
nearly
every
street
in
the
european
quarter
was
impassable
through
fallen
and
falling
houses
empty
jewel
cases
and
broken
clocks
lay
on
the
pavements
every
shop
was
looted
and
by
the
time
admiral
seymour
did
land
it
was
impossible
for
his
middies
to
buy
any
jam
one
of
them
has
recorded
this
misfortune
adding
that
in
other
ways
alexandria
then
in
flames
was
well
meanwhile
the
khedive
had
returned
to
his
palace
and
order
was
slowly
restored
it
is
not
known
how
many
lives
were
lost
in
this
avoidable
disaster
iv
a
large
british
force
was
despatched
under
lord
wolseley
to
the
suez
force
that
finally
defeated
arabi
at
but
until
it
reached
egypt
alexandria
remained
in
danger
for
arabi
might
attack
from
his
camp
at
so
the
city
had
to
be
defended
on
the
east
in
the
middle
of
july
general
alison
arrived
with
a
few
troops
including
artillery
and
occupied
the
barracks
at
mustapha
pacha
the
hill
of
abou
el
nawatir
and
the
water
works
down
by
the
canal
he
could
thus
watch
arabi
s
movements
and
he
had
a
second
strongly
fortified
position
at
the
gates
of
the
antoniadis
gardens
in
case
he
was
attacked
from
the
south
here
he
was
able
to
hold
on
and
to
harry
the
enemy
s
outposts
until
pressure
was
relieved
his
losses
were
slight
the
regiments
involved
are
commemorated
by
tablets
in
the
english
church
next
month
wolseley
arrived
and
having
inspected
the
position
his
troops
and
pretended
that
he
was
going
to
land
at
aboukir
arabi
was
deceived
and
prepared
resistance
there
wolseley
steamed
past
him
and
landed
at
port
said
instead
arabi
then
had
to
break
up
his
camp
and
the
danger
for
alexandria
was
over

conclusion
since
the
bombardment
of
the
city
has
known
other
troubles
but
they
will
not
be
here
described
nor
will
any
peroration
be
attempted
for
the
reason
that
alexandria
is
still
alive
and
alters
even
while
one
tries
to
sum
her
up
politically
she
is
now
more
closely
connected
with
the
rest
of
egypt
than
ever
in
the
past
but
the
old
foreign
elements
remain
and
it
is
to
the
oldest
of
them
the
greek
that
she
owes
such
modern
culture
as
is
to
be
found
in
her
her
future
like
that
of
other
great
commercial
cities
is
dubious
except
in
the
cases
of
the
public
gardens
and
the
museum
the
municipality
has
scarcely
risen
to
its
historic
responsibilities
the
library
is
starved
for
want
of
funds
the
art
gallery
can
not
be
alluded
to
and
links
with
the
past
have
been
wantonly
example
the
name
of
the
rue
rosette
has
been
altered
and
the
exquisite
covered
bazaar
near
the
rue
de
france
destroyed
material
prosperity
based
on
cotton
onions
and
eggs
seems
assured
but
little
progress
can
be
discerned
in
other
directions
and
neither
the
pharos
of
sostratus
nor
the
idylls
of
theocritus
nor
the
enneads
of
plotinus
are
likely
to
be
rivalled
in
the
future
only
the
climate
only
the
north
wind
and
the
sea
remain
as
pure
as
when
menelaus
the
first
visitor
landed
upon
three
thousand
years
ago
and
at
night
the
constellation
of
berenice
s
hair
still
shines
as
brightly
as
when
it
caught
the
attention
of
conon
the
astronomer
the
god
abandons
antony
when
at
the
hour
of
midnight
an
invisible
choir
is
suddenly
heard
passing
with
exquisite
music
with
do
not
lament
your
fortune
that
at
last
subsides
your
life
s
work
that
has
failed
your
schemes
that
have
proved
illusions
but
like
a
man
prepared

a
brave
man
bid
farewell
to
her
to
alexandria
who
is
departing
above
all
do
not
delude
yourself
do
not
say
that
it
is
a
dream
that
your
ear
was
mistaken
do
not
condescend
to
such
empty
hopes
like
a
man
for
long
prepared
like
a
brave
man
like
to
the
man
who
was
worthy
of
such
a
city
go
to
the
window
firmly
and
listen
with
emotion
but
not
with
the
prayers
and
complaints
of
the
coward
ah
supreme
rapture
listen
to
the
notes
to
the
exquisite
instruments

farewell

the

is
good
considering
its
miserable
endowment
the
city
that
once
had
the
greatest
library
in
the
world
now
can
not
afford
more
than
per

for
the
combined
purchase

binding
of

beyond
the

is
a
far
more
adequate
museum
the
museum
the
collection
was
not
formed
until
by
which
time
most
of
the
antiques
in
the
neighbourhood
had
passed
into
private
hands
it
is
consequently
not
of
the
first
order
and
little
in
it
has
outstanding
beauty
used
rightly
it
is
of
great
value
but
the
visitor
who
goes
through
it
will
find
afterwards
that
it
has
gone
through
him
and
that
he
is
left
with
nothing
but
a
vague
memory
of
fatigue
the
absence
of
colour
the
numerous
small
exhibits
in
terra
cotta
and
limestone
will
tend
to
depress
him
and
to
give
a
false
impression
of
a
civilization
which
whatever
its
defects
was
not
dull
he
should
not
visit
the
collection
until
he
has
learned
or
imagined
something
about
the
ancient
city
and
he
should
visit
certain
definite
objects
and
then
come
golden
rule
indeed
in
all
museums
he
may
then
find
that
a
scrap
of
the
past
has
come
alive

it
can
not
be
as
late
as
alexander

we
should
have
records
it
is
the
oldest

in

also
the
most
romantic
for
to
its

added
the
mystery
of
the
sea
long

narrow
the

stretched
from
the
rock
of
abou
bakr
on
the
west
to
an
eastern
barrier
that
touched
the
shore
beyond
the
tour
de

these
two
points
are
joined
up
by
a
series
of
breakwaters
on

unexpected
direction

rounded

another

were
well
in
the
middle
of
the

with
a
subsidiary
harbour
to

the
visit
to
the
harbour
is
best
made
by
boat
since
most
of
the
remains
now
lie
from

feet
under
the
sea
they
have
like
all
the

line
subsided
because
the
nile
deposits
on
which
they

are
apt

compress

even
to
slide

water
they
are
built
of
limestone
blocks
from
the
quarries
of
mex
and
dekhela
but
the
construction
necessarily
simple
gives
no
hint
as
to
nationality

the

some
knowledge

is
desirable
the
fortunes

were
complicated
and
the
labours

have
only
lately
made
them
clear
history
the
original
building
also
the
lighthouse
took
its
name
from
pharos
island
hence
the
french
phare
and
the
italian
faro
no
doubt
it
entered
into
alexander
the
great
s
scheme
for
his
maritime
capital
but
the
work
was
not
done
till
the
reign
of
ptolemy

probable
date
of
dedication
when
the
king
held
a
festival
to
commemorate
his
parents
architect
sostratus
an
asiatic
greek
the
sensation
it
caused
was
tremendous
it
appealed
both
to
the
sense
of
beauty
and
to
the
taste
for
appeal
typical
of
the
age
poets
and
engineers
combined
to
praise
it
just
as
the
parthenon
had
been
identified
with
athens
and
peter
s
was
to
be
identified
with
rome
so
to
the
imagination
of
contemporaries
the
pharos
became
alexandria
and
alexandria
became
the
pharos
never
in
the
history
of
architecture
has
a
secular
building
been
thus
worshipped
and
taken
on
a
spiritual
life
of
its
own
it
beaconed
to
the
imagination
not
only
to
ships
at
sea
and
long
after
its
light
was
extinguished

it

despite

bore

visitors
speak
of
a
mysterious
mirror
on

was

more

than

what
was
this
mirror
was
it
a
polished
steel
reflector
for
the
fire
at
night
or
for
heliography
by

some
accounts
describe
it
as
made
of
finely
wrought
glass
or
transparent
stone
and
declare
that
a
man
sitting
under
it
could
see
ships
at

that
were
invisible
to
the

eye
a
telescope
is
it
possible
that
the
great
alexandrian
school
of
mathematics
discovered
the
lens
and
that
their
discovery
was
lost
and
forgotten
when
the
pharos
fell
it
is
possible
it
is
certain
that
the
lighthouse
was
fitted
with
every
scientific
improvement
known
to
the
age
that
the
antique
world
never
surpassed
it
and
that
the
mediaeval
world
regarded
it
as
the
work
of
jinns
standing
on
the
lantern
was
a
statue
of
poseidon
this
terminated
the
tower
whose
complete
height
certainly
exceeded
feet
and
possibly
touched
history
of
the
building
we
must
now
follow
this
masterpiece
of
engineering
into
ages
of
myth
and
oblivion
it
retained
its
form
and
functions
unimpaired
up
to
the
arab
conquest
the
first
and
irreparable
disaster
was
the
fall
of
the
lantern
about
entailing
the
loss
of
scientific
apparatus
that
could
not
be
replaced
there
is
a
legend
that
the
disaster
was
planned
by
the
byzantine
emperor
who
could
not
attack
egypt
owing
to
the
magic
mirror
which
detected
or
destroyed
his
ships
he
sent
an
agent
who
gained
the
caliph
s
confidence
and
told
him
that
beneath
the
pharos
the
treasure
of
alexander
the
great
lay
buried
the
caliph
commenced
demolition
and
before
the
inhabitants
of
alexandria
who
knew
better
could
intervene
the
two
upper
stories
had
fallen
into
the
sea
henceforth
the
pharos
is
only
a
stump
with
a
bonfire
on
the
top
there
were
restorations
under
ibn
touloun
and
also
about
but
they
were
unsubstantial
additions
to
the
octagon
which
the
wind
could
blow
away
structural
repairs
were
neglected
and
about
the
second
disaster
fall
of
the
octagon
itself
through
an
earthquake
the
square
bottom
story
survived
but
only
as
a
watchtower
on
the
top
of
which
was
run
up
a
small
square
mosque
plan
i
fig
ii
which
illustrates
this
state
of
the
pharos
the
level
of
the
ground
has
risen
owing
to
the
debris
from
the
octagon
and
the
lower
story
has
been
buttressed
then
came
the
final
earthquake
cent
and
the
slow
dissolution
was
over
though
unable
to
preserve
the
pharos
the
arabs
admired
it
and
speak
with
their
love
of
the
marvellous
of
a
statue
on
it
whose
finger
followed
the
diurnal
course
of
the
sun
of
a
second
statue
who
gave
out
with
varying
and
melodious
voices
the
various
hours
of
the
day
and
of
a
third
who
shouted
an
alarm
as
soon
as
a
hostile
flotilla
set
sail
the
first
two
statues
may
have
existed
the
alexandrians
loved
such
toys
and
there
is
an
element
of
truth
in
another
arab
the
building
rested
upon
a
glass
some
vitrious
composition
probably
did
form
the
foundation
and
we
know
that
cleopatra
s
needle
actually
did
rest
on
crabs
of
metal
the
oriental
mind
has
confused
the
two
monuments
the
legend
culminates
in
the
visit
to
the
pharos
of
a
cavalcade
of
horsemen
who
lose
their
way
in
the
rooms
and
inadvertently
riding
into
a
crack
in
the
glass
crab
s
back
fall
into
the
sea
but
sometimes
the
lighthouse
sheltered
pleasanter
adventures
the
poet
el
deraoui
for
example
writes
a
lofty
platform
guides
the
voyager
by
night
guides
him
with
its
light
when
the
darkness
of
evening
falls
thither
have
i
borne
a
garment
of
perfect
pleasure
among
my
friends
a
garment
adorned
with
the
memory
of
beloved
companions
on
its
height
a
dome
enshadowed
me
and
thence
i
saw
my
friends
like
stars
i
thought
that
the
sea
below
me
was
a
cloud
and
that
i
had
set
up
my
tent
in
the
midst
of
the
heavens
moreover
el
manarah
as
the
arabs
called
it
gave
the
name
to
and
became
the
model
for
the
there
is
no
minaret
in
alexandria
that
closely
follows
the
pharos
but
at
cairo
at
the
tombs
of
the
mamelukes
one
can
still
see
the
square

octagon

the

exactly
reproduce

like
all
his
work
it
is
architecturally
fine
and
even
in
decay

harmonious
the

was
a
pentagon

in

the

the
reputation
of
an
impregnable

mysterious

is
a
noble
work
and
it
is
a
pity
it
is
approached
through
a
gateway
that
suggests
an
english
provincial

the
embellishments
of

are
unduly
lugubrious
the

probably
diverged

there
are
traces

the
interior
of

its

some
of
these
foundations
can
be
seen
in
the
passage
immediately
to
the
right
of
the
castle
the
orientation
of
the
castle
and
the
pharos
was
not
exactly
the
same
since
the
castle
had
to
be
adjusted
to
the
points
of
the
compass
on
account
of
the
mosque
that
it
modern
buildings
to
the
right
of
the
passage
also
rest
on
old
foundations
it
is
thought
that
here
stood
the
reservoir
filled
with
fresh
water
from
the
mainland
and
that
on
the
other
side
left
of
present
castle
stood
another
edifice
with
the
mechanical
statues
to
balance
the
design
but
this
is
all
conjecture
the
in
the
castle
is
notable
for
two
reasons
architecturally
it
is
the
oldest
in
the
city
and
in
style
it
is
essentially
cairene
it
was
built
by
the
central
government
in
the
course
of
their
coast
defence
scheme
and
so
does
not
resemble
the
ordinary
mosque
of
the
delta
the
entrance
with
its
five
monoliths
of
assouan
granite
taken
from
the
pharos
is
almost
druidical
in
effect
but
the
arch
above
them
and
the
flanking
towers
faintly
recall
the
glories
of
kait

the
most
interesting
is
the
tomb
of
henry
salt
salt
a
vigorous
but
rather
shady
englishman
with
an
artistic
temperament
first
came
to
these
parts
in
when
he
was
sent
on
a
mission
to
abyssinia
six
years
later
he
became
consul
general
and
fell
in
with
the
financial
plans
of
mohammed
ali
and
acquiesced
in
his
illegal
monopolies
he
was
an
ardent
archaeologist
of
the
commercial
type
and
got
concessions
for
excavating
in
upper
egypt
offering
the
results
at
exorbitant
rates
to
the
british
museum
after
much
haggling
the
museum
bought
his
collection
in
he
died
near
alexandria
in
the
quaint
inscription
on
his
tomb
says
his
ready
genius
explored
and
elucidated
the
hieroglypics
sic
and
other
antiquities
of
this
country
his
faithful
and
rapid
pencil
and
the
nervous
originality
of
his
untutored
senses
conveyed
to
the
world
vivid
ideas
of
the
scenes
that
had
delighted
himself
some
of
the
tombs
are
hidden
among
plants
and
ferns
the
cemetery
was
once
much
larger
the
road
has
cut
through
it
at
the
end
of
the
rue
abou
el
dardaa
where
the
tram
turns
is
the
of
here
probably
stood
the
mosque
of
mercy
which
the
conqueror
amr
ordered
to
be
built
where
he
had
sheathed
his
sword
after
the
recapture
of
the
city
in
we
turn
right
for
a
few
yards
along
a
road
that
follows
the
line
of
the
vanished
arab
walls
then
to
the
left
by
the
big
italian
schools
the
tram
has
now
entered
the
ancient
district
of
rhakotis
pompey
s
pillar
and
the
temple
of
serapis
illustration
pompey
s
pillar
etc
as
often
happens
in
alexandria
history
and
archaeology
fail
to
support
one
another
ancient
writers
do
not
mention
pompey
s
pillar
but
they
tell
us
a
great
deal
about
the
buildings
that
stood
in
its
neighbourhood
and
have
now
disappeared
this
shapeless
hill
was
from
early
times
covered
with
temples
and
houses
long
before
alexander
came
it
was
the
citadel
of
rhakotis
osiris
was
worshipped
here
then
with
ptolemy
soter
it
leaps
into
fame
osiris
is
modified
into
serapis
and
the
hill
encased
in
great
bastions
of
masonry
was
built
up
into
an
acropolis
on
whose
summit
rose
the
god
s
temple
under
cleopatra
it
gained
additional
splendour
the
great
library
of
alexandria
had
been
burnt
in
the
caesarian
war
and
the
queen
began
a
new
collection
which
she
attached
to
the
serapeum
here
for
four
hundred
years
was
the
most
learned
spot
on
the
earth
the
christians
wiped
it
out
in
the
patriarch
theophilus
led
a
mob
against
the
temple
sacked
it
and
broke
the
statue
of
the
god
it
is
impossible
that
the
books
should
not
have
perished
at
the
same
time
they
were
arranged
in
the
cloisters
that
surrounded
the
temple
below
so
that
the
mob
had
to
pass
them
to
reach
its
central
prey
the
monks
now
swarmed
over
the
hill
and
built
a
church
to
john
the
baptist
in
the
gutted
shrine
here
were
the
head
quarters
of
theophilus
nephew
cyril
and
hence
his
supporters
issued
to
murder
hypatia
at
the
other
end
of
the
town
with
the
invasion
of
the
arabs
the
darkness
increases
the
library
had
already
disappeared
the
legend
accusing
them
of
burning
it
has
the
flimsiest
foundations
but
they
did
plenty
of
harm
in
other
ways
one
of
the
arab
governors
threw
a
quantity
of
columns
into
the
sea
in
the
hope
of
obstructing
a
hostile
fleet
when
the
crusaders
visited
egypt
cent
the
original
scheme
of
the
acropolis
had
vanished
and
their
attention
was
caught
by
this
solitary
pillar
the
crusaders
were
no
scholars
but
they
had
heard
of
pompey
so
they
called
the
pillar
after
him
and
said
that
his
head
was
enclosed
in
a
ball
on
the
top
belon
s
view
the
error
has
been
perpetuated
and
the
visitor
must
remember
firstly
that
the
pillar
has
nothing
to
do
with
pompey
and
secondly
that
it
is
a
subordinate
monument
that
the
accident
of
time
has
preserved
it
is
a
part
and
a
small
one
of
the
splendours
of
the
temple
of
serapis
the
following
remains
can
be
visited
plan
i
pompey
s
feet
high
and
about
thick
made
of
red
granite
from
assouan
an
imposing
but
ungraceful
object
architecture
has
evolved
nothing
more
absurd
than
the
monumental
column
there
is
no
reason
that
it
should
ever
stop
nor
much
that
it
should
begin
and
this
specimen
is
not
even
well
proportioned
the
substructure
is
interesting
it
is
made
up
of
blocks
that
have
been
taken
from
older
buildings
on
the
eastern
face
nearest
turnstile
is
a
block
of
green
granite
with
an
inscription
in
greek
in
honour
of
arsinoe
the
sister
and
wife
of
ptolemy
philadelphus
on
the
opposite
face
upside
down
in
a
recess
is
the
figure
and
hieroglyph
of
seti
i
suggesting
the
great
age
of
the
settlement
on
rhakotis
why
and
when
was
the
pillar
put
up
probably
to
the
emperor
diocletian
about
there
is
a
four
line
greek
inscription
to
him
on
the
granite
base
on
the
western
side
about
feet
up
it
is
illegible
and
indeed
invisible
from
the
ground
generations
of
scholars
have
worked
at
it
with
the
following
result
to
the
most
just
emperor
the
tutelary
god
of
alexandria
diocletian
the
invincible
postumus
prefect
of
the
formidable
emperor
had
crushed
a
rebellion
here
and
was
a
god
to
be
propitiated
the
pillar
erected
in
the
precincts
of
serapis
would
celebrate
his
power
and
clemency
and
presumably
bore
his
statue
on
the
is
another
theory
that
the
column
was
dedicated
after
the
triumph
of
the
christians
in
and
glorifies
the
new
religion
if
this
is
so
it
must
itself
have
previously
been
pagan
for
by
this
date
the
alexandrians
had
not
the
means
or
the
power
to
erect
a
new
monument
of
such
a
size
ii
temple
of
west
of
the
pillar
reached
by
a
staircase
are
long
subterranean
galleries
excavated
in
the
rock
and
lined
with
limestone
these
were
probably
part
of
the
of
some
enthusiastic
visitors
have
even
identified
them
with
the
library
where
the
books
were
kept
in
them
are
some
small
niches
of
unknown
use
some
marble
columns
stand
on
the
ground
of
the
pillar
near
the
sphinxes
are
more
passages
lined
with
cement
these
too
may
have
been
part
of
the
temple
all
is
conjectural
and
the
plan
of
the
serapeum
as
we
gather
it
from
classical
writers
can
in
no
way
be
fitted
in
with
existing
remains
according
to
them
it
was
rectangular
and
stood
in
the
middle
of
a
cloister
with
each
of
whose
sides
it
was
connected
by
a
the
temple
consisted
of
a
great
hall
and
an
inner

architecture
was
probably
greek

statue

work
of
bryaxis

of
isis

of
osiris
was
equally
united
to
his
successor
serapis

had
in
ptolemaic
times
her
temple
on
the
plateau
north
of
the
pillar
are
some
excavations
that
have
been
identified
with
it
iv

magnificently
worked
in

lie
on
the
slope
east
of

we
pass
them
on
the
way
up
date
cent
they
may
have
belonged
to
the
great
entrance
gate
of
the
temple
enclosure
he
who
meditates
on
them
for
a
little
may
recapture
some
idea
of
the
shrine
note
the
pillar
itself
so
suggests
vanished
glory
and
solidity
this
concludes
the
remains
they
are
disappointing
for
so
famous
a
site
but
there
is
one
satisfaction
this
is
the
actual
spot
long
in

it
has
been
identified
by
the
statues
and
inscriptions
that
have
been

poured

famous
at

the

canopus
according

was
a
pilot
of

who
was
bitten
here
by

legend
like

of

shows

interested

no

there
is
also
a
legend
that
canopus

god

was

earthenware

this
too
may
be
discredited
with

foundation
of

the
district
lost
much
of
its
trade
but
became
a
great
fashionable
and
religious
resort
there
was
a
canal
from
alexandria
probably
connecting
with
the
nile
just
where
it
entered
the
sea
and
the
alexandrians
glided
along
it
in
barges
singing
and
crowned
with
flowers
in
connection
with
his
new
cult
of
serapis
ptolemy
soter
built
a
temple
here
below
whose
fame
spread
over
the
world
and
whose
rites
made
the
romans
blush
with
shame
or
pale
with
envy
here
originated
the
idea
still
so
widely
held
in
the
west
that
egypt
is
a
land
of
licentiousness
and
mystery
the
district
decayed
as
soon
as
christianity
was
established
it
had
not
like
alexandria
a
solid
basis
for
its
existence
in
trade
but
paganism
lingered
here
and
as
late
as
the
end
of
the
century
twenty
of
idols
were
found
secreted
in
a
house

the
patriarch
cyril
having
destroyed
the
cults
of
serapis
and
isis
in
the
district
sent
out
the
relics
of
cyr
to
take
their
place
the
relics
were
so
intermingled
with
those
of
another
martyr
john
that
john
had
to
be
brought
too
and
a
church
to
them
both
arose
just
to
the
south
of
the
present
fort
kait
bey
the
two
saints
remained
quiet
for
years
but
then
began
to
disentangle
themselves
and
work
miracles
and
recovered
for
the
district
some
of
its
ancient
popularity
indeed
many
of
their
cures
are
exactly
parallel
to
those
effected
in
the
temple
of
serapis
with
the
arab
invasion
their
church
vanishes
but
cyr
has
given
his
name
to
modern
aboukir
father
in
the
century
the
canopic
branch
of
the
nile
dried
up
the
turks
built
some
forts
here
for
coastal
defence
but
history
does
not
recommence
until
the
arrival
of
nelson
iii
modern
in
napoleonic
times
aboukir
saw
two
great
battles
battle
of
the
for
the
event
that
led
to
this
engagement
brueys
napoleon
s
admiral
brought
his
fleet
into
the
bay
for
safety
and
anchored
them
in
a
long
line
about
two
miles
from
the
coast
he
had
frigates
canons
and
men
to
the
north
was
nelson
s
island
as
it
is
now
called
which
he
had
fortified
and
upon
which
his
line
was
supposed
to
rest
his
flagship
the
was
midway
in
the
line
he
took
up
this
position
on
july
on
august
nelson
arrived
in
pursuit
with
canons
and
men
the
wind
was
a
usual
direction
in
summer
half
his
fleet
including
his
flagship
the
attacked
brueys
from
the
expected
quarter
the
east
the
other
half
led
by
the
executed
the
brilliant
manœuvre
that
brought
us
victory
it
gave
brueys
a
double
surprise
in
the
first
place
it
passed
between
the
head
of
his
line
and
nelson
island
where
he
thought
there
was
no
room
in
the
second
place
it
took
up
a
position
to
his
west
between
him
and
the
shore
where
he
thought
the
water
was
too
shallow
thus
he
was
caught
between
two
by
the
whole
british
fleet
with
the
exception
of
the
which
sailing
too
near
nelson
island
stranded
the
engagement
began
at
at
brueys
was
killed
at
the
caught
fire
and
blew
up
shortly
afterwards
the
explosion
was
tremendous
and
terminated
the
first
act
of
the
battle
an
interval
of
appalled
silence
ensued
casabianca
was
sailing
the
and
it
was
on
her
burning
deck
that
the
boy
of
hemans
poem
stood
the
fighting
recommenced
continuing
through
the
night
and
ending
at
midday
on
the
with
the
complete
victory
of
nelson
the
french
fleet
had
been
annihilated
only
two
and
two
frigates
escaped
and
napoleon
had
lost
for
ever
his
command
of
the
mediterranean
nelson
accordingly
signalled
the
following
message
almighty
god
having
blessed
his
majesty
s
arms
with
victory
the
admiral
intends
returning
public
thanksgiving
for
the
same
at
two
o
clock
this
day
and
he
recommends
every
ship
doing
the
same
as
soon
as
convenient
the
french
expected
an
attack
on
alexandria
but
nelson
had
suffered
too
much
himself
to
attempt
this
having
rested
for
a
little
he
dispersed
his
fleet
leaving
only
a
few
ships
behind
to
watch
the
coast
in
his
despatches
home
he
stated
that
the
engagement
had
taken
place
not
far
from
the
rosetta
mouth
of
the
nile
hence
the
official
battle
of
the
nile
instead
of
the
more
accurate
naval
battle
of
battle
of
less
important
than
its
predecessor
but
the
strategy
is
interesting
and
napoleon
himself
was
present
for
the
events
that
led
up
to
it
turkey
at
the
instigation
of
england
had
declared
war
on
france
and
in
july
the
turks
occupied
aboukir
bay
and
landed
men
their
left
rested
on
the
present
fort
ramleh
their
right
on
the
present
fort
tewfikieh
their
camp
was
in
the
narrow
extremity
of
the
peninsula
between
the
redoubt
and
the
fort
at
the
very
tip
they
were
supported
on
three
sides
by
their
fleet
which
was
stationed
in
the
mediterranean
in
the
bay
of
aboukir
and
in
the
vanished
lake
of
aboukir
from
this
stronghold
they
proposed
to
overrun
egypt
on
receiving
the
news
napoleon
hurried
down
from
cairo
and
arrived
july
with
only
men
mostly
cavalry
murat
and
kléber
accompanied
him
he
began
by
clearing
the
turkish
gun
boats
out
of
lake
aboukir
then
his
force
attacked
forts
ramleh
and
tewfikieh
while
his
cavalry
under
murat
advancing
over
the
level
ground
between
them
drove
the
flying
defenders
of
each
into
the
mediterranean
and
the
bay
respectively
turks
were
drowned
the
tip
of
the
peninsula
remained
and
resisted
vigorously
but
napoleon
managed
to
mount
some
of
his
guns
on
the
hard
spit
of
sand
that
still
extends
along
the
shore
of
the
bay
and
thus
to
cannonade
the
turkish
camp
which
was
finally
taken
by

the
ruins
above
lie
round
fort
tewfikieh
which
is
seen
to
the

as
the

runs
into
the

they
were
once
of
interest
but
have
been
almost
entirely
destroyed
by
the
military
authorities
who
use
the
limestone
blocks
for
road
making
and
allow

not
easy

the
of
the
most
famous
building
on
the

and
celebrated
throughout

antique
world
it
was
dedicated
by
ptolemy
iii
euergetes
and
his
wife
berenice
a
few
years
later
their
baby
daughter
died
and
the
priests
met
here
in
conclave
to
make
her
a
goddess
and
incidentally
to
endorse
some
reforms
in
the
calendar
that
the
king
who
had
a
scientific
mind
was
pressing
the
pronouncement
has
been
preserved
in

chief
documents
for

at
alexandria
invalids

slept
here
even
by

discovered
next

were

also
the

enemies

christianity
attacked
it
just
before
its
destruction
antoninus
an
able
pagan
reactionary
settled
here
and
tried
to
revive
the
cult
often
he
told
his
disciples
that
after
his
time
there
would
be
no
temple
and
that
the
great
and
venerable
sanctuary
would
remain
only
as
an
unmeaning
mass
of
ruins
forgotten
by
eunapius
life
of
edesius
antoninus
was
right
in
ancient
time
the
temple
probably
stood
on
the
highest
ground
but
with
the
general
rising
of
level
the
site
is
now
in
a
deep
depression
and
must
be
hunted
for
patiently
an
oblong
space
has
been
cleared
and
some
columns
and
capitals
from
the
excavations
have
been
ranged
round
it
but
it
is
impossible
to
reconstruct
the
original
plan
and
much
has
yet
to
be
unearthed
indeed
it
is
not
quite
certain
that
this
is
the
right
temple
an
inscription
has
been
discovered
dedicating
it
not
to
serapis
but
to
whom
however
serapis
was
often
identified
the
columns
are
of
granite
or
of
limestone
beneath
the
broken
tin
shelter
was
once
a

the
finest
object
is
a

column
of

it

a
basalt
inscription
now
in
the
british
museum
the
inscription
enumerates
the
merits
of
king
ptolemy
v
epiphanes
see
genealogical

it
is
a
dull
document
a
copy
of
the
original
decree
which
was
set
up
at
memphis
and
reproduced
broadcast
over
the
country
but
it
is
important
because
it
is
written
in
three
demotic
and
thus
led
to
the
deciphering
of
the
ancient
egyptian
language
the
antique
columns
that
may
be
seen
in
rosetta
also
probably
came
from
bolbitiné
but
it
was
never
important
and
the
sands
have
now
covered
it
ii
itself
was
founded
in
by
el
motaouakel
one
of
the
abbaside
caliphs
of

the
date
is
most
significant
by

canopic
mouth
of
the

dried
up
and
isolated

from
the
egyptian
water
system
shipping
passed
back
to

and
frequented
it
again
for
nearly
a
thousand
years

as
the

named
the
new

western
port
of

damietta
being
the
eastern
it
was
important
in
the
crusades
louis
of
france
knew
it
as
in
the
and
centuries
it
was
practically
rebuilt
in
its
present
form
the
mosques

cisterns
the
great
warehouses
for
grain
that
line
the
river
bank
all
date
from
this
period
it
evolved
an
architectural
style
suitable
to
the
locality
the
chief
material
is
brick
made
from
the
nile
mud
and
coloured
red
or
black
there
was
no
limestone
to
hand
such
as
supplied
alexandria
with
the
bricks
are
introduced
courses
of
palm
wood
antique
columns
and
a
certain
amount
of
mashrabiyeh
work
and
faience
the
style
is
picturesque
rather
than
noble
and
may
be
compared
with
the
brick
style
of
the
north
german
hansa
towns
examples
of
it
are
to
be
found
throughout
the
delta
and
even
in
alexandria
herself
but
rosetta
is
its
head
quarters
in
architecture
as
in
other
matters
the
town
kept
in
touch
with
cairo
an
oriental
town
scarcely
westernised
even
so
long
as
alexandria
lay
dormant
it
flourished
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
its
population
was
that
of
alexandria
in
napoleon
s
troops
took
rosetta
in
the
british
and
turks
retook
it
in
the
reconnoitring
expedition
of
general
frazer
was
here
repulsed
these
events
unimportant
in
themselves
were
the
prelude
to
an
irreparable
disaster
the
revival
of
alexandria
on
scientific
lines
by
mohammed
ali
as
soon
as
he
developed
the
harbours
there
and
restored
the
connection
with
the
nile
water
systems
by
cutting
the
mahmoudieh
canal
rosetta
began
to
decay
exactly
as
bolbitiné
had
decayed
two
thousand
years
before
the
population
now
is
as
against
alexandria
s
and
it
has
become
wizen
and
puny
through
inbreeding
the
warehouses
and
mosques
are
falling
down
the
costly
private
dwellings
of
the
merchants
have
been
gutted
and
the
sand
advancing
from
the
south
and
from
the
west
invades
a
little
farther
every
year
through
the
palm
groves
and
into
the
streets
one
can
wander
aimlessly
for
hours
it
is
best
thus
to
wander
and
can
see
nothing
that
is
modern
nor
anything
more
exciting
than
the
arrival
of
the
fishing
fleet
with
sardines
it
is
the
east
at
last
but
the
east
outwitted
by
science
and
in
the
last
stages
of
exhaustion
the
main
street
of
rosetta
starts
from
the
railway
station
and
runs
due
south
parallel
to
the
river
so
it
is
easy
to
find
one
s
way
in
it
is
the
only
hotel
kept
by
a
greek
those
who
are
not
fastidious
can
sleep
here
the
rest
must
manage
to
see
the
sights
between
trains
the
hotel
has
a
pleasant
garden
overlooked
by
the
minaret
of
a
mosque
in
the
main
street
to
the
right
of
built
but
containing
the
tomb
of
the
saint
who
died
in
the
century
a
large
but
uninteresting
building
with
an
entrance
porch
in
the
delta
arranged
in
patterns
pendentives
further
down
to
the
left
by
the
covered
bazaars
entrance
with
old
doors
to
a
large
ruined
building
probably
once
an
okel
or
courtyard
for
travellers
and
their
animals
one
can
walk
through
it
and
come
out
the
other
side
through
a
fine
portal
in
the
direction
of
the
river
all
this
part
of
the
town
is
most
picturesque
the
houses
are
four
or
five
stories
high
and
have
antique
columns
fantastically
disposed
among
their
brickwork
the
best
and
oldest
example
of
this
domestic
architecture
is
the
of
in
the
haret
with
inscriptions
above
its
lintels
that
date
it
its
external
staircase
leads
to
two
doors
those
of

is
the
most
important
building
in
the
town
the
of
it
really
consists
of
two
mosques
the
western
was
founded
about
by
zagloul
the
mamaluke

of

the

all
is

minarets
the
ruined

was
cut
with

according
to
local
opinion
but
according
to
archaeology
fell
in
the
early
cent
the
sanctuary
of
the
mosque
of
zagloul
proper
is
a
stupendous
hall
over
columns
many
of
them
antique
are
arranged
in
six
parallel
rows
there
are
four
praying
niches

and
in
the
tomb
his
former
master
the
said
hassan
lies
with
him
and
shares
his
honours
the
sanctuary
is
ruinous
and
carelessly
built
but
its
perspective
effects
especially
from
the
south
wall
near

are
very
fine

rival
those
of

the

it
has
played

it
looks
no
more
than
a
hole
in
a
ruined

but
it
can
easily
be
reconstructed
each
side
of

were

by
which
the

was
carried
to
the
simpler
version
of
the
double
spiral
that
ascended
the
huge
alexandrian
building
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
taposiris
lighthouse
was
modelled
on
its
gigantic
about
it
is
thus
of
great
importance
to
archaeologists
and
historians
throughout

pierced

would
not
abandon
christ
when
the
army
moved
back
into
egypt
his
friends
brought
his
ashes
with
them
and
at
the
entrance
of
the
lybian
desert
a
miracle
took
place
the
camel
that
was
carrying
the
burden
refused
to
go
further
the
saint
was
buried
and
forgotten
but
a
shepherd
observed
that
a
sick
lamb
that
crossed
the
spot
became
well
he
tried
successfully
with
another
lamb
then
a
sick
princess
was
healed
the
remains
were
exhumed
and
a
church
built
over
the
grave
this
church
can
still
be
traced
it
is
the
basilica
of
the
crypt
plan
i
date
to
which
at
the
end
of
the
century
an
immense
extension
was
added
by
the
emperor
arcadius

caused
so
rapid
a
growth
water
there
were

in

little
flasks
stamped
with
the
saint
s
image
were
filled
from
the
sacred
source
by
his
tomb
the
environs
were
irrigated
houses
walls
cemeteries
built
until
in
the
pure
air
a
sacred
city
sprang
up
where
religion
was
combined
with
hygiene
nor
did
the
saint
only
protect
invalids
he
was
also
the
patron
of
the
caravans
that
passed
by
him
from
alexandria
to
the
wady
natrun
the
siwan
oasis
and
tripoli
and
so
he
is
always
seen
between
two
camels
who
crouch
in
adoration
because
he
guides
them
aright
by
the
century
he
had
become
god
of
the
lybian
desert
then
less
deserted
than
now
and
his
fame
like
that
of
his
predecessor
serapis
had
travelled
all
round
the
mediterranean
and
procured
him
worshippers
as
far
as
rome
and
france
islam
checked
the
cult
but
as
late
as
the
year
an
arab
traveller
saw
the
great
double
basilica
still
standing
lights
burned
in
the
shrine
night
and
day
and
there
was
still
left
a
little

barren

in

central
which
the

survives
in
the
form
of
a
chain
of
mineral
lakes
the
deposits
were
worked
from
antiquity
but
with
the
rise
of
monasticism
the
wady
took
a
new
importance
owing
to
its
discomfort
as
early
as
fronto
retreated
here
from
alexandria
ammon
followed
in
macarius
or
mercury
a
hundred
years
later
the
more
moderate
ascetics
extracted
soda
with
the
assistance
of
laymen
the
extremists
sought
a
waterless
stretch
called
the
southern
portion
of
the
valley
where
the
monastery
to
macarius
still
stands
there
were
soon
monks
it
is
natural
that
so
remote
a
community
should
lose
touch
with
the
theological
niceties
of
the
capital
and
in
the
patriarch
theophilus
was
obliged
to
rebuke
the
monks
for
minimising
the
divine
element
in
the
second
person
their
reply
was
startling
they
crossed
the
desert
stormed
alexandria
and
made
the
patriarch
apologise
a
few
years
later
he
led
an
army
into
the
wady
to
punish
them
but
by
now
oddly
enough
they
had
veered
to
the
opposite
error
they
minimised
the
human
element
the
truth
is
they
represented
native
egypt
the
patriarch
the
hellenising
coast
the
quarrel
was
racial
rather
than
theological
and
when
in
the
century
it
came
to
a
head
the
wady
became
the
natural
stronghold
of
the
national
or
monophysite
party
who
under
the
name
of
copts
worship
there
to
this
day
with
the
century
came
a
new
industrial
it
is
the
factory
chimney
of
the
salt

soda
company
that
now
dominates
the

the
lakes

the
chief
product
is
caustic
soda
which
is
poured
red
hot
into
metal
drums

exported
all

the

ordinary

natron

the

appendix
i
the
modern
religious
communities
the
ecclesiastical
life
of
alexandria
is
not
as
intense
as
in
the
days
of
athanasius
but
it
is
even
more
complicated
the
city
is
the
seat
of
four
patriarchates
and
many
other
religious
bodies
are
represented
in
her
the
complications
are
partly
due
to
the
activity
of
roman
catholicism
which
in
order
to
win
oriental
schismatics
back
to
the
fold
has
in
each
case
created
a
counter
church
that
shall
approximate
as
nearly
as
possible
to
the
conditions
and
ritual
that
are
an
armenian
catholic
church
for
the
armenians
a
coptic
catholic
for
the
copts
and
further
complications
proceed
from
the
modern
commercial
communities
who
tend
to
regard
religion
as
an
expression
of
nationality
rather
than
of
dogma
the
following
list
of
the
churches
may
indicate
the
unsuspected
vastness
of
the
subject
greek
patriarchate
orthodox
greek
or
melchite
church
from
melek
arabic
for
king
present
patriarch
photius
i
his
position
is
curious
he
is
a
subject
neither
to
the
kingdom
of
greece
nor
to
the
patriarch
of
constantinople
but
holds
or
rather
held
his
position
from
the
sultan
of
turkey
direct
thus
ecclesiastically
he
is
independent
his
title
is
patriarch
of
alexandria
lybia
pentapolis
ethiopia
and
all
egypt
but
his
patriarchate
does
not
extend
beyond
egypt
which
he
administers
through
four
bishops
historically
he
represents
the
church
that
kept
loyal
to
byzantium
and
to
the
emperor
at
the
council
of
chalcedon
when
the
rest
of
egypt
began
to
drift
away
over
the
monophysite
question
after
the
arab
conquest
the
greek
patriarch
resided
in
cairo
but
came
back
to
alexandria
about
sixty
years
ago
to
the
convent
and
church
of
saba
as
for
dogma
the
greek
orthodox
chiefly
differs
from
the
roman
catholic
and
the
protestants
over
the
filioque
clause
in
the
nicene
creed
it
holds
that
the
holy
ghost
proceeded
not
from
the
father
and
the
son
but
through
the
son
this
is
the
point
over
which
the
east
and
west
split
and
failed
to
reunite
in
churches
of
the
greek
community
these
too
are
greek
orthodox
in
faith
but
they
do
not
recognise
the
patriarch
indeed
their
relations
with
him
during
the
late
war
were
of
the
liveliest
they
are
the
churches
of
a
body
of
business
men
who
only
owe
allegiance
to
the
kingdom
of
greece
they
are
and
choose
their
own
priests
the
patriarch
however
has
the
right
of
examining
those
priests
credential
and
of
giving
them
permission
to
officiate
the
community
has
a

that
after

the
divine
and

human
in
christ
were
united
into
a
single
nature
this
severs
them
from
the
rest
of

historically
the
patriarchate
is
the
opponent
of
the
greek
orthodox
patriarchate
from
whom
it
split
at
the

lord
answered
and
said

that
which

bitterness

when
salome

originally
passed
by
the
council

the
paragraph
against

additions
to

we
believe
in
one
god
the
father
almighty
maker
of
all
things
both
visible
and
invisible
and
in
one
lord
jesus
christ
the
son
of
god
begotten

the
father
only
begotten

light
of
light
very
god
of
very
god
begotten
not
made
being
of
one
substance
with
the
father
by
whom
all
things
were
made
both
things
in
heaven
and
things
on
earth
who
for
us
men
and
for
our
salvation
came
down
and
was
made
flesh
made
man
suffered
and
rose
again
on
the

up
into
the

and

again

the
quick
and
the
dead

the
holy
catholic
and
apostolic
church
anathematises
those
who
say
that
there
was
a
time
when
the
son
of
god
was
not
and
that
he
was
not
before
he
was
begotten
and
that
he
was
made
from
that
which
did
not
exist
or
who
assert
that
he
is
of

substance
