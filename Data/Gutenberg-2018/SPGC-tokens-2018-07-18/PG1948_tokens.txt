the
story
of
a
bad
boy
by
thomas
bailey
aldrich
chapter
one
in
which
i
introduce
myself
this
is
the
story
of
a
bad
boy
well
not
such
a
very
bad
but
a
pretty
bad
boy
and
i
ought
to
know
for
i
am
or
rather
i
was
that
boy
myself
lest
the
title
should
mislead
the
reader
i
hasten
to
assure
him
here
that
i
have
no
dark
confessions
to
make
i
call
my
story
the
story
of
a
bad
boy
partly
to
distinguish
myself
from
those
faultless
young
gentlemen
who
generally
figure
in
narratives
of
this
kind
and
partly
because
i
really
was
not
a
cherub
i
may
truthfully
say
i
was
an
amiable
impulsive
lad
blessed
with
fine
digestive
powers
and
no
hypocrite
i
did
want
to
be
an
angel
and
with
the
angels
stand
i
did
think
the
missionary
tracts
presented
to
me
by
the
rev
wibird
hawkins
were
half
so
nice
as
robinson
crusoe
and
i
did
send
my
little
to
the
natives
of
the
feejee
islands
but
spent
it
royally
in
and
taffy
candy
in
short
i
was
a
real
human
boy
such
as
you
may
meet
anywhere
in
new
england
and
no
more
like
the
impossible
boy
in
a
storybook
than
a
sound
orange
is
like
one
that
has
been
sucked
dry
but
let
us
begin
at
the
beginning
whenever
a
new
scholar
came
to
our
school
i
used
to
confront
him
at
recess
with
the
following
words
my
name
tom
bailey
what
your
name
if
the
name
struck
me
favorably
i
shook
hands
with
the
new
pupil
cordially
but
if
it
did
i
would
turn
on
my
heel
for
i
was
particular
on
this
point
such
names
as
higgins
wiggins
and
spriggins
were
deadly
affronts
to
my
ear
while
langdon
wallace
blake
and
the
like
were
passwords
to
my
confidence
and
esteem
ah
me
some
of
those
dear
fellows
are
rather
elderly
boys
by
this
time
lawyers
merchants
soldiers
authors
what
not
phil
adams
a
special
good
name
that
adams
is
consul
at
shanghai
where
i
picture
him
to
myself
with
his
head
closely
shaved
he
never
had
too
much
hair
and
a
long
pigtail
banging
down
behind
he
is
married
i
hear
and
i
hope
he
and
she
that
was
miss
wang
wang
are
very
happy
together
sitting
over
their
diminutive
cups
of
tea
in
a
skyblue
tower
hung
with
bells
it
is
so
i
think
of
him
to
me
he
is
henceforth
a
jewelled
mandarin
talking
nothing
but
broken
china
whitcomb
is
a
judge
sedate
and
wise
with
spectacles
balanced
on
the
bridge
of
that
remarkable
nose
which
in
former
days
was
so
plentifully
sprinkled
with
freckles
that
the
boys
christened
him
pepper
whitcomb
just
to
think
of
little
pepper
whitcomb
being
a
judge
what
would
he
do
to
me
now
i
wonder
if
i
were
to
sing
out
pepper
some
day
in
court
fred
langdon
is
in
california
in
the
business
he
used
to
make
the
best
i
ever
tasted
binny
wallace
sleeps
in
the
old
south
and
jack
harris
too
is
dead
harris
who
commanded
us
boys
of
old
in
the
famous
battles
of
slatter
hill
was
it
yesterday
i
saw
him
at
the
head
of
his
regiment
on
its
way
to
join
the
shattered
army
of
the
potomac
not
yesterday
but
six
years
ago
it
was
at
the
battle
of
the
seven
pines
gallant
jack
harris
that
never
drew
rein
until
he
had
dashed
into
the
rebel
battery
so
they
found
him
lying
across
the
enemy
guns
how
we
have
parted
and
wandered
and
married
and
died
i
wonder
what
has
become
of
all
the
boys
who
went
to
the
temple
grammar
school
at
rivermouth
when
i
was
a
youngster
all
all
are
gone
the
old
familiar
faces
it
is
with
no
ungentle
hand
i
summon
them
back
for
a
moment
from
that
past
which
has
closed
upon
them
and
upon
me
how
pleasantly
they
live
again
in
my
memory
happy
magical
past
in
whose
fairy
atmosphere
even
conway
mine
ancient
foe
stands
forth
transfigured
with
a
sort
of
dreamy
glory
encircling
his
bright
red
hair
with
the
old
school
formula
i
commence
these
sketches
of
my
boyhood
my
name
is
tom
bailey
what
is
yours
gentle
reader
i
take
for
granted
it
is
neither
wiggins
nor
spriggins
and
that
we
shall
get
on
famously
together
and
be
capital
friends
forever
chapter
two
in
which
i
entertain
peculiar
views
i
was
born
at
rivermouth
but
before
i
had
a
chance
to
become
very
well
acquainted
with
that
pretty
new
england
town
my
parents
removed
to
new
orleans
where
my
father
invested
his
money
so
securely
in
the
banking
business
that
he
was
never
able
to
get
any
of
it
out
again
but
of
this
hereafter
i
was
only
eighteen
months
old
at
the
time
of
the
removal
and
it
make
much
difference
to
me
where
i
was
because
i
was
so
small
but
several
years
later
when
my
father
proposed
to
take
me
north
to
be
educated
i
had
my
own
peculiar
views
on
the
subject
i
instantly
kicked
over
the
little
negro
boy
who
happened
to
be
standing
by
me
at
the
moment
and
stamping
my
foot
violently
on
the
floor
of
the
piazza
declared
that
i
would
not
be
taken
away
to
live
among
a
lot
of
yankees
you
see
i
was
what
is
called
a
northern
man
with
southern
i
had
no
recollection
of
new
england
my
earliest
memories
were
connected
with
the
south
with
aunt
chloe
my
old
negro
nurse
and
with
the
great
garden
in
the
centre
of
which
stood
our
house
a
whitewashed
stone
house
it
was
with
wide
verandas
shut
out
from
the
street
by
lines
of
orange
fig
and
magnolia
trees
i
knew
i
was
born
at
the
north
but
hoped
nobody
would
find
it
out
i
looked
upon
the
misfortune
as
something
so
shrouded
by
time
and
distance
that
maybe
nobody
remembered
it
i
never
told
my
schoolmates
i
was
a
yankee
because
they
talked
about
the
yankees
in
such
a
scornful
way
it
made
me
feel
that
it
was
quite
a
disgrace
not
to
be
born
in
louisiana
or
at
least
in
one
of
the
border
states
and
this
impression
was
strengthened
by
aunt
chloe
who
said
dar
was
no
in
the
norf
no
way
and
on
one
occasion
terrified
me
beyond
measure
by
declaring
that
if
any
of
dem
mean
whites
tried
to
git
her
away
from
marster
she
was
to
knock
on
de
head
wid
a
gourd
the
way
this
poor
creature
eyes
flashed
and
the
tragic
air
with
which
she
struck
at
an
imaginary
mean
white
are
among
the
most
vivid
things
in
my
memory
of
those
days
to
be
frank
my
idea
of
the
north
was
about
as
accurate
as
that
entertained
by
the
englishmen
of
the
present
day
concerning
america
i
supposed
the
inhabitants
were
divided
into
two
classes
indians
and
white
people
that
the
indians
occasionally
dashed
down
on
new
york
and
scalped
any
woman
or
child
giving
the
preference
to
children
whom
they
caught
lingering
in
the
outskirts
after
nightfall
that
the
white
men
were
either
hunters
or
schoolmasters
and
that
it
was
winter
pretty
much
all
the
year
round
the
prevailing
style
of
architecture
i
took
to
be
with
this
delightful
picture
of
northern
civilization
in
my
eye
the
reader
will
easily
understand
my
terror
at
the
bare
thought
of
being
transported
to
rivermouth
to
school
and
possibly
will
forgive
me
for
kicking
over
little
black
sam
and
otherwise
misconducting
myself
when
my
father
announced
his
determination
to
me
as
for
kicking
little
sam
i
always
did
that
more
or
less
gently
when
anything
went
wrong
with
me
my
father
was
greatly
perplexed
and
troubled
by
this
unusually
violent
outbreak
and
especially
by
the
real
consternation
which
he
saw
written
in
every
line
of
my
countenance
as
little
black
sam
picked
himself
up
my
father
took
my
hand
in
his
and
led
me
thoughtfully
to
the
library
i
can
see
him
now
as
he
leaned
back
in
the
bamboo
chair
and
questioned
me
he
appeared
strangely
agitated
on
learning
the
nature
of
my
objections
to
going
north
and
proceeded
at
once
to
knock
down
all
my
pine
log
houses
and
scatter
all
the
indian
tribes
with
which
i
had
populated
the
greater
portion
of
the
eastern
and
middle
states
who
on
earth
tom
has
filled
your
brain
with
such
silly
stories
asked
my
father
wiping
the
tears
from
his
eyes
aunt
chloe
sir
she
told
and
you
really
thought
your
grandfather
wore
a
blanket
embroidered
with
beads
and
ornamented
his
leggins
with
the
scalps
of
his
enemies
well
sir
i
did
think
that
did
think
that
exactly
tom
you
will
be
the
death
of
he
hid
his
face
in
his
handkerchief
and
when
he
looked
up
he
seemed
to
have
been
suffering
acutely
i
was
deeply
moved
myself
though
i
did
not
clearly
understand
what
i
had
said
or
done
to
cause
him
to
feel
so
badly
perhaps
i
had
hurt
his
feelings
by
thinking
it
even
possible
that
grandfather
nutter
was
an
indian
warrior
my
father
devoted
that
evening
and
several
subsequent
evenings
to
giving
me
a
clear
and
succinct
account
of
new
england
its
early
struggles
its
progress
and
its
present
condition
faint
and
confused
glimmerings
of
all
which
i
had
obtained
at
school
where
history
had
never
been
a
favorite
pursuit
of
mine
i
was
no
longer
unwilling
to
go
north
on
the
contrary
the
proposed
journey
to
a
new
world
full
of
wonders
kept
me
awake
nights
i
promised
myself
all
sorts
of
fun
and
adventures
though
i
was
not
entirely
at
rest
in
my
mind
touching
the
savages
and
secretly
resolved
to
go
on
board
the
ship
the
journey
was
to
be
made
by
sea
with
a
certain
little
brass
pistol
in
my
in
case
of
any
difficulty
with
the
tribes
when
we
landed
at
boston
i
could
get
the
indian
out
of
my
head
only
a
short
time
previously
the
cherokees
or
was
it
the
camanches
had
been
removed
from
their
in
arkansas
and
in
the
wilds
of
the
southwest
the
red
men
were
still
a
source
of
terror
to
the
border
settlers
trouble
with
the
indians
was
the
staple
news
from
florida
published
in
the
new
orleans
papers
we
were
constantly
hearing
of
travellers
being
attacked
and
murdered
in
the
interior
of
that
state
if
these
things
were
done
in
florida
why
not
in
massachusetts
yet
long
before
the
sailing
day
arrived
i
was
eager
to
be
off
my
impatience
was
increased
by
the
fact
that
my
father
had
purchased
for
me
a
fine
little
mustang
pony
and
shipped
it
to
rivermouth
a
fortnight
previous
to
the
date
set
for
our
own
departure
for
both
my
parents
were
to
accompany
me
the
pony
which
nearly
kicked
me
out
of
bed
one
night
in
a
dream
and
my
father
promise
that
he
and
my
mother
would
come
to
rivermouth
every
other
summer
completely
resigned
me
to
the
situation
the
pony
name
was
gitana
which
is
the
spanish
for
gypsy
so
i
always
called
her
she
was
a
lady
pony
gypsy
at
length
the
time
came
to
leave
the
mansion
among
the
to
say
goodby
to
little
black
sam
i
am
convinced
he
was
heartily
glad
to
get
rid
of
me
and
to
part
with
simple
aunt
chloe
who
in
the
confusion
of
her
grief
kissed
an
eyelash
into
my
eye
and
then
buried
her
face
in
the
bright
bandana
turban
which
she
had
mounted
that
morning
in
honor
of
our
departure
i
fancy
them
standing
by
the
open
garden
gate
the
tears
are
rolling
down
aunt
chloe
cheeks
sam
six
front
teeth
are
glistening
like
pearls
i
wave
my
hand
to
him
manfully
then
i
call
out
goodby
in
a
muffled
voice
to
aunt
chloe
they
and
the
old
home
fade
away
i
am
never
to
see
them
again
chapter
three
on
board
the
typhoon
i
do
not
remember
much
about
the
voyage
to
boston
for
after
the
first
few
hours
at
sea
i
was
dreadfully
unwell
the
name
of
our
ship
was
the
a
no
packet
i
learned
afterwards
that
she
sailed
fast
only
in
the
newspaper
advertisements
my
father
owned
one
quarter
of
the
typhoon
and
that
is
why
we
happened
to
go
in
her
i
tried
to
guess
which
quarter
of
the
ship
he
owned
and
finally
concluded
it
must
be
the
hind
quarter
the
cabin
in
which
we
had
the
cosiest
of
with
one
round
window
in
the
roof
and
two
shelves
or
boxes
nailed
up
against
the
wall
to
sleep
in
there
was
a
good
deal
of
confusion
on
deck
while
we
were
getting
under
way
the
captain
shouted
orders
to
which
nobody
seemed
to
pay
any
attention
through
a
battered
tin
trumpet
and
grew
so
red
in
the
face
that
he
reminded
me
of
a
pumpkin
with
a
lighted
candle
inside
he
swore
right
and
left
at
the
sailors
without
the
slightest
regard
for
their
feelings
they
did
mind
it
a
bit
however
but
went
on
singing
heave
ho
with
the
rum
below
and
hurrah
for
the
spanish
main
o
i
will
not
be
positive
about
the
spanish
main
but
it
was
hurrah
for
something
i
considered
them
very
jolly
fellows
and
so
indeed
they
were
one
tar
in
particular
struck
my
fancy
a
jovial
man
about
fifty
years
of
age
with
twinkling
blue
eyes
and
a
fringe
of
gray
hair
circling
his
head
like
a
crown
as
he
took
off
his
tarpaulin
i
observed
that
the
top
of
his
head
was
quite
smooth
and
flat
as
if
somebody
had
sat
down
on
him
when
he
was
very
young
there
was
something
noticeably
hearty
in
this
man
bronzed
face
a
heartiness
that
seemed
to
extend
to
his
loosely
knotted
neckerchief
but
what
completely
won
my
was
a
picture
of
enviable
loveliness
painted
on
his
left
arm
it
was
the
head
of
a
woman
with
the
body
of
a
fish
her
flowing
hair
was
of
livid
green
and
she
held
a
pink
comb
in
one
hand
i
never
saw
anything
so
beautiful
i
determined
to
know
that
man
i
think
i
would
have
given
my
brass
pistol
to
have
had
such
a
picture
painted
on
my
arm
while
i
stood
admiring
this
work
of
art
a
fat
wheezy
steamtug
with
the
word
ajax
in
staring
black
letters
on
the
paddlebox
came
puffing
up
alongside
the
typhoon
it
was
ridiculously
small
and
conceited
compared
with
our
stately
ship
i
speculated
as
to
what
it
was
going
to
do
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
lashed
to
the
little
monster
which
gave
a
snort
and
a
shriek
and
commenced
backing
us
out
from
the
levee
wharf
with
the
greatest
ease
i
once
saw
an
ant
running
away
with
a
piece
of
cheese
eight
or
ten
times
larger
than
itself
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
it
when
i
found
the
chubby
towing
the
typhoon
out
into
the
mississippi
river
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
we
swung
round
the
current
caught
us
and
away
we
flew
like
a
great
winged
bird
only
it
did
seem
as
if
we
were
moving
the
shore
with
the
countless
steamboats
the
tangled
rigging
of
the
ships
and
the
long
lines
of
warehouses
appeared
to
be
gliding
away
from
us
it
was
grand
sport
to
stand
on
the
and
watch
all
this
before
long
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
on
other
side
but
stretches
of
low
swampy
land
covered
with
stunted
cypress
trees
from
which
drooped
delicate
streamers
of
spanish
moss
a
fine
place
for
alligators
and
congo
snakes
here
and
there
we
passed
a
yellow
and
here
and
there
a
snag
lifted
its
nose
out
of
the
water
like
a
shark
this
is
your
last
chance
to
see
the
city
to
see
the
city
tom
said
my
father
as
we
swept
round
a
bend
of
the
river
i
turned
and
looked
new
orleans
was
just
a
colorless
mass
of
something
in
the
distance
and
the
dome
of
the
charles
hotel
upon
which
the
sun
shimmered
for
a
moment
was
no
bigger
than
the
top
of
old
aunt
chloe
thimble
what
do
i
remember
next
the
gray
sky
and
the
fretful
blue
waters
of
the
gulf
the
had
long
since
let
slip
her
hawsers
and
gone
panting
away
with
a
derisive
scream
as
much
as
to
say
i
done
my
duty
now
look
out
for
yourself
old
typhoon
the
ship
seemed
quite
proud
of
being
left
to
take
care
of
itself
and
with
its
huge
white
sails
bulged
out
strutted
off
like
a
vain
turkey
i
had
been
standing
by
my
father
near
the
all
this
while
observing
things
with
that
nicety
of
perception
which
belongs
only
to
children
but
now
the
dew
began
falling
and
we
went
below
to
have
supper
the
fresh
fruit
and
milk
and
the
slices
of
cold
chicken
looked
very
nice
yet
somehow
i
had
no
appetite
there
was
a
general
smell
of
tar
about
everything
then
the
ship
gave
sudden
lurches
that
made
it
a
matter
of
uncertainty
whether
one
was
going
to
put
his
fork
to
his
mouth
or
into
his
eye
the
tumblers
and
wineglasses
stuck
in
a
rack
over
the
table
kept
clinking
and
clinking
and
the
cabin
lamp
suspended
by
four
gilt
chains
from
the
ceiling
swayed
to
and
fro
crazily
now
the
floor
seemed
to
rise
and
now
it
seemed
to
sink
under
one
feet
like
a
there
were
not
more
than
a
dozen
passengers
on
board
including
ourselves
and
all
of
these
excepting
a
old
gentleman
a
retired
disappeared
into
their
staterooms
at
an
early
hour
of
the
evening
after
supper
was
cleared
away
my
father
and
the
elderly
gentleman
whose
name
was
captain
truck
played
at
checkers
and
i
amused
myself
for
a
while
by
watching
the
trouble
they
had
in
keeping
the
men
in
the
proper
places
just
at
the
most
exciting
point
of
the
game
the
ship
would
careen
and
down
would
go
the
white
checkers
among
the
black
then
my
father
laughed
but
captain
truck
would
grow
very
angry
and
vow
that
he
would
have
won
the
game
in
a
move
or
two
more
if
the
confounded
old
that
what
he
called
the
ship
lurched
i
i
think
i
will
go
to
bed
now
please
i
said
laying
my
band
on
my
father
knee
and
feeling
exceedingly
queer
it
was
high
time
for
the
typhoon
was
plunging
about
in
the
most
alarming
fashion
i
was
speedily
tucked
away
in
the
upper
berth
where
i
felt
a
trifle
more
easy
at
first
my
clothes
were
placed
on
a
narrow
shelf
at
my
feet
and
it
was
a
great
comfort
to
me
to
know
that
my
pistol
was
so
handy
for
i
made
no
doubt
we
should
fall
in
with
pirates
before
many
hours
this
is
the
last
thing
i
remember
with
any
distinctness
at
midnight
as
i
was
afterwards
told
we
were
struck
by
a
gale
which
never
left
us
until
we
came
in
sight
of
the
massachusetts
coast
for
days
and
days
i
had
no
sensible
idea
of
what
was
going
on
around
me
that
we
were
being
hurled
somewhere
and
that
i
did
like
it
was
about
all
i
knew
i
have
indeed
a
vague
impression
that
my
father
used
to
climb
up
to
the
berth
and
call
me
his
ancient
mariner
bidding
me
cheer
up
but
the
ancient
mariner
was
far
from
cheering
up
if
i
recollect
rightly
and
i
do
believe
that
venerable
navigator
would
have
cared
much
if
it
had
been
announced
to
him
through
a
that
a
low
black
suspicious
craft
with
raking
masts
was
rapidly
bearing
down
upon
us
in
fact
one
morning
i
thought
that
such
was
the
case
for
bang
went
the
big
cannon
i
had
noticed
in
the
bow
of
the
ship
when
we
came
on
board
and
which
had
suggested
to
me
the
idea
of
pirates
bang
went
the
gun
again
in
a
few
seconds
i
made
a
feeble
effort
to
get
at
my
but
the
typhoon
was
only
saluting
cape
cod
the
first
land
sighted
by
vessels
approaching
the
coast
from
a
southerly
direction
the
vessel
had
ceased
to
roll
and
my
passed
away
as
rapidly
as
it
came
i
was
all
right
now
only
a
little
shaky
in
my
timbers
and
a
little
blue
about
the
gills
as
captain
truck
remarked
to
my
mother
who
like
myself
had
been
confined
to
the
during
the
passage
at
cape
cod
the
wind
parted
company
with
us
without
saying
as
much
as
excuse
me
so
we
were
nearly
two
days
in
making
the
run
which
in
favorable
weather
is
usually
accomplished
in
seven
hours
that
what
the
pilot
said
i
was
able
to
go
about
the
ship
now
and
i
lost
no
time
in
cultivating
the
acquaintance
of
the
sailor
with
the
lady
on
his
arm
i
found
him
in
the
forecastle
a
sort
of
cellar
in
the
front
part
of
the
vessel
he
was
an
agreeable
sailor
as
i
had
expected
and
we
became
the
best
of
friends
in
five
minutes
he
had
been
all
over
the
world
two
or
three
times
and
knew
no
end
of
stories
according
to
his
own
account
he
must
have
been
shipwrecked
at
least
twice
a
year
ever
since
his
birth
he
had
served
under
decatur
when
that
gallant
officer
peppered
the
algerines
and
made
them
promise
not
to
sell
their
prisoners
of
war
into
slavery
he
had
worked
a
gun
at
the
bombardment
of
vera
cruz
in
the
mexican
war
and
he
had
been
on
alexander
selkirk
island
more
than
once
there
were
very
few
things
he
had
done
in
a
seafaring
way
i
suppose
sir
i
remarked
that
your
name
is
typhoon
why
lord
love
ye
lad
my
name
benjamin
watson
of
nantucket
but
i
a
true
blue
typhooner
he
added
which
increased
my
respect
for
him
i
do
know
why
and
i
did
know
then
whether
typhoon
was
the
name
of
a
vegetable
or
a
profession
not
wishing
to
be
outdone
in
frankness
i
disclosed
to
him
that
my
name
was
tom
bailey
upon
which
he
said
he
was
very
glad
to
hear
it
when
we
got
more
intimate
i
discovered
that
sailor
ben
as
he
wished
me
to
call
him
was
a
perfect
walking
picturebook
he
had
two
anchors
a
star
and
a
frigate
in
full
sail
on
his
right
arm
a
pair
of
lovely
blue
hands
clasped
on
his
breast
and
i
no
doubt
that
other
parts
of
his
body
were
illustrated
in
the
same
agreeable
manner
i
imagine
he
was
fond
of
drawings
and
took
this
means
of
gratifying
his
artistic
taste
it
was
certainly
very
ingenious
and
convenient
a
portfolio
might
be
misplaced
or
dropped
overboard
but
sailor
ben
had
his
pictures
wherever
he
went
just
as
that
eminent
person
in
the
poem
with
rings
on
her
fingers
and
bells
on
her
toes
was
accompanied
by
music
on
all
occasions
the
two
bands
on
his
breast
he
informed
me
were
a
tribute
to
the
memory
of
a
dead
messmate
from
whom
he
had
parted
years
ago
and
surely
a
more
touching
tribute
was
never
engraved
on
a
tombstone
this
caused
me
to
think
of
my
parting
with
old
aunt
chloe
and
i
told
him
i
should
take
it
as
a
great
favor
indeed
if
he
would
paint
a
pink
hand
and
a
black
hand
on
my
chest
he
said
the
colors
were
pricked
into
the
skin
with
needles
and
that
the
operation
was
somewhat
painful
i
assured
him
in
an
manner
that
i
did
mind
pain
and
begged
him
to
set
to
work
at
once
the
fellow
who
was
probably
not
a
little
vain
of
his
skill
took
me
into
the
forecastle
and
was
on
the
point
of
complying
with
my
request
when
my
father
happened
to
own
the
gangway
a
circumstance
that
rather
interfered
with
the
decorative
art
i
did
have
another
opportunity
of
conferring
alone
with
sailor
ben
for
the
next
morning
bright
and
early
we
came
in
sight
of
the
cupola
of
the
boston
state
house
chapter
four
rivermouth
it
was
a
beautiful
may
morning
when
the
typhoon
hauled
up
at
long
wharf
whether
the
indians
were
not
early
risers
or
whether
they
were
away
just
then
on
a
i
could
determine
but
they
did
not
appear
in
any
great
force
in
fact
did
not
appear
at
all
in
the
remarkable
geography
which
i
never
hurt
myself
with
studying
at
new
orleans
was
a
picture
representing
the
landing
of
the
pilgrim
fathers
at
plymouth
the
pilgrim
fathers
in
rather
odd
hats
and
coats
are
seen
approaching
the
savages
the
savages
in
no
coats
or
hats
to
speak
of
are
evidently
undecided
whether
to
shake
hands
with
the
pilgrim
fathers
or
to
make
one
grand
rush
and
scalp
the
entire
party
now
this
scene
had
so
stamped
itself
on
my
mind
that
in
spite
of
all
my
father
had
said
i
was
prepared
for
some
such
greeting
from
the
aborigines
nevertheless
i
was
not
sorry
to
have
my
expectations
unfulfilled
by
the
way
speaking
of
the
pilgrim
fathers
i
often
used
to
wonder
why
there
was
no
mention
made
of
the
pilgrim
mothers
while
our
trunks
were
being
hoisted
from
the
hold
of
the
ship
i
mounted
on
the
roof
of
the
cabin
and
took
a
critical
view
of
boston
as
we
came
up
the
harbor
i
had
noticed
that
the
houses
were
huddled
together
on
an
immense
bill
at
the
top
of
which
was
a
large
building
the
state
house
towering
proudly
above
the
rest
like
an
amiable
surrounded
by
her
brood
of
chickens
a
closer
inspection
did
not
impress
me
very
favorably
the
city
was
not
nearly
so
imposing
as
new
orleans
which
stretches
out
for
miles
and
miles
in
the
shape
of
a
crescent
along
the
banks
of
the
majestic
river
i
soon
grew
tired
of
looking
at
the
masses
of
houses
rising
above
one
another
in
irregular
tiers
and
was
glad
my
father
did
not
propose
to
remain
long
in
boston
as
i
leaned
over
the
rail
in
this
mood
a
little
boy
with
no
shoes
said
that
if
i
would
come
down
on
the
wharf
he
lick
me
for
two
cents
not
an
exorbitant
price
but
i
did
go
down
i
climbed
into
the
rigging
and
stared
at
him
this
as
i
was
rejoiced
to
observe
so
exasperated
him
that
he
stood
on
his
head
on
a
pile
of
boards
in
order
to
pacify
himself
the
first
train
for
rivermouth
left
at
noon
after
a
late
breakfast
on
board
the
typhoon
our
trunks
were
piled
upon
a
and
ourselves
stowed
away
in
a
coach
which
must
have
turned
at
least
one
hundred
corners
before
it
set
us
down
at
the
railway
station
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
we
were
shooting
across
the
country
at
a
fearful
rate
now
clattering
over
a
bridge
now
screaming
through
a
tunnel
here
we
cut
a
flourishing
village
in
two
like
a
knife
and
here
we
dived
into
the
shadow
of
a
pine
forest
sometimes
we
glided
along
the
edge
of
the
ocean
and
could
see
the
sails
of
ships
twinkling
like
bits
of
silver
against
the
horizon
sometimes
we
dashed
across
rocky
where
cattle
were
loafing
it
was
fun
to
scare
cows
that
lay
round
in
groups
under
the
newly
budded
trees
near
the
railroad
track
we
did
not
pause
at
any
of
the
little
brown
stations
on
the
route
they
looked
just
like
overgrown
clocks
though
at
every
one
of
them
a
man
popped
out
as
if
he
were
worked
by
machinery
and
waved
a
red
flag
and
appeared
as
though
he
would
like
to
have
us
stop
but
we
were
an
express
train
and
made
no
stoppages
excepting
once
or
twice
to
give
the
engine
a
drink
it
is
strange
how
the
memory
clings
to
some
things
it
is
over
twenty
years
since
i
took
that
first
ride
to
rivermouth
and
yet
oddly
enough
i
remember
as
if
it
were
yesterday
that
as
we
passed
slowly
through
the
village
of
hampton
we
saw
two
boys
fighting
behind
a
red
barn
there
was
also
a
shaggy
yellow
dog
who
looked
as
if
he
had
commenced
to
unravel
barking
himself
all
up
into
a
knot
with
excitement
we
had
only
a
hurried
glimpse
of
the
battle
long
enough
however
to
see
that
the
combatants
were
equally
matched
and
very
much
in
earnest
i
am
ashamed
to
say
how
many
times
since
i
have
speculated
as
to
which
boy
got
licked
maybe
both
the
small
rascals
are
dead
now
not
in
consequence
of
the
let
us
hope
or
maybe
they
are
married
and
have
pugnacious
urchins
of
their
own
yet
to
this
day
i
sometimes
find
myself
wondering
how
that
fight
turned
out
we
had
been
riding
perhaps
two
hours
and
a
half
when
we
shot
by
a
tall
factory
with
a
chimney
resembling
a
church
steeple
then
the
locomotive
gave
a
scream
the
engineer
rang
his
bell
and
we
plunged
into
the
twilight
of
a
long
wooden
building
open
at
both
ends
here
we
stopped
and
the
conductor
thrusting
his
head
in
at
the
car
door
cried
out
passengers
for
rivermouth
at
last
we
had
reached
our
journey
end
on
the
platform
my
father
shook
hands
with
a
straight
brisk
old
gentleman
whose
face
was
very
serene
and
rosy
he
had
on
a
white
hat
and
a
long
coat
the
collar
of
which
came
clear
up
above
his
cars
he
did
look
unlike
a
pilgrim
father
this
of
course
was
grandfather
nutter
at
whose
house
i
was
born
my
mother
kissed
him
a
great
many
times
and
i
was
glad
to
see
him
myself
though
i
naturally
did
not
feel
very
intimate
with
a
person
whom
i
had
not
seen
since
i
was
eighteen
months
old
while
we
were
getting
into
the
wagon
which
grandfather
nutter
had
provided
i
took
the
opportunity
of
asking
after
the
health
of
the
pony
the
pony
had
arrived
all
right
ten
days
before
and
was
in
the
stable
at
home
quite
anxious
to
see
me
as
we
drove
through
the
quiet
old
town
i
thought
rivermouth
the
prettiest
place
in
the
world
and
i
think
so
still
the
streets
are
long
and
wide
shaded
by
gigantic
american
elms
whose
drooping
branches
interlacing
here
and
there
span
the
avenues
with
arches
graceful
enough
to
be
the
handiwork
of
fairies
many
of
the
houses
have
small
in
front
gay
in
the
season
with
and
are
substantially
built
with
massive
and
protruding
eaves
a
beautiful
river
goes
rippling
by
the
town
and
after
turning
and
twisting
among
a
lot
of
tiny
islands
empties
itself
into
the
sea
the
harbor
is
so
fine
that
the
largest
ships
can
sail
directly
up
to
the
wharves
and
drop
anchor
only
they
do
years
ago
it
was
a
famous
seaport
princely
fortunes
were
made
in
the
west
india
trade
and
in
when
we
were
at
war
with
great
britain
any
number
of
privateers
were
fitted
out
at
rivermouth
to
prey
upon
the
merchant
vessels
of
the
enemy
certain
people
grew
suddenly
and
mysteriously
rich
a
great
many
of
the
first
families
of
today
do
not
care
to
trace
their
pedigree
back
to
the
time
when
their
grandsires
owned
shares
in
the
matilda
jane
guns
well
well
few
ships
come
to
rivermouth
now
commerce
drifted
into
other
ports
the
phantom
fleet
sailed
off
one
day
and
never
came
back
again
the
crazy
old
warehouses
are
empty
and
barnacles
and
cling
to
the
piles
of
the
crumbling
wharves
where
the
sunshine
lies
lovingly
bringing
out
the
faint
spicy
odor
that
haunts
the
place
the
ghost
of
the
old
dead
west
india
trade
during
our
ride
from
the
station
i
was
struck
of
course
only
by
the
general
neatness
of
the
houses
and
the
beauty
of
the
lining
the
streets
i
describe
rivermouth
now
as
i
came
to
know
it
afterwards
rivermouth
is
a
very
ancient
town
in
my
day
there
existed
a
tradition
among
the
boys
that
it
was
here
christopher
columbus
made
his
first
landing
on
this
continent
i
remember
having
the
exact
spot
pointed
out
to
me
by

one
thing
is
certain
captain
john
smith
who
afterwards
according
to
the
legend
married
pocahontas
whereby
he
got
powhatan
for
a
the
river
in
and
was
much
charmed
by
the
beauty
of
rivermouth
which
at
that
time
was
covered
with
wild
rivermouth
figures
prominently
in
all
the
colonial
histories
every
other
house
in
the
place
has
its
tradition
more
or
less
grim
and
entertaining
if
ghosts
could
flourish
anywhere
there
are
certain
streets
in
rivermouth
that
would
be
full
of
them
i
do
know
of
a
town
with
so
many
old
houses
let
us
linger
for
a
moment
in
front
of
the
one
which
the
oldest
inhabitant
is
always
sure
to
point
out
to
the
curious
stranger
it
is
a
square
wooden
edifice
with
gambrel
roof
and
over
the
windows
and
doors
there
used
to
be
heavy
carvings
and
acorns
and
angels
heads
with
wings
spreading
from
the
ears
oddly
jumbled
together
but
these
ornaments
and
other
outward
signs
of
grandeur
have
long
since
disappeared
a
peculiar
interest
attaches
itself
to
this
house
not
because
of
its
age
for
it
has
not
been
standing
quite
a
century
nor
on
account
of
its
architecture
which
is
not
striking
but
because
of
the
illustrious
men
who
at
various
periods
have
occupied
its
spacious
chambers
in
it
was
an
aristocratic
hotel
at
the
left
side
of
the
entrance
stood
a
high
post
from
which
swung
the
sign
of
the
earl
of
halifax
the
landlord
was
a
stanch
loyalist
that
is
to
say
he
believed
in
the
king
and
when
the
overtaxed
colonies
determined
to
throw
off
the
british
yoke
the
adherents
to
the
crown
held
private
meetings
in
one
of
the
back
rooms
of
the
tavern
this
irritated
the
rebels
as
they
were
called
and
one
night
they
made
an
attack
on
the
earl
of
halifax
tore
down
the
signboard
broke
in
the
and
gave
the
landlord
hardly
time
to
make
himself
invisible
over
a
fence
in
the
rear
for
several
months
the
shattered
tavern
remained
deserted
at
last
the
exiled
innkeeper
on
promising
to
do
better
was
allowed
to
return
a
new
sign
bearing
the
name
of
william
pitt
the
friend
of
america
swung
proudly
from
the
and
the
patriots
were
appeased
here
it
was
that
the
from
boston
twice
a
week
for
many
a
year
set
down
its
load
of
travelers
and
gossip
for
some
of
the
details
in
this
sketch
i
am
indebted
to
a
recently
published
chronicle
of
those
times
it
is
the
french
fleet
is
lying
in
the
harbor
of
rivermouth
and
eight
of
the
principal
officers
in
white
uniforms
trimmed
with
gold
lace
have
taken
up
their
quarters
at
the
sign
of
the
william
pitt
who
is
this
young
and
handsome
officer
now
entering
the
door
of
the
tavern
it
is
no
less
a
personage
than
the
marquis
lafayette
who
has
come
all
the
way
from
providence
to
visit
the
french
gentlemen
boarding
there
what
a
cavalier
he
is
with
his
quick
eyes
and
coal
black
hair
forty
years
later
he
visited
the
spot
again
his
locks
were
gray
and
his
step
was
feeble
but
his
heart
held
its
young
love
for
liberty
who
is
this
finely
dressed
traveler
alighting
from
his
attended
by
servants
in
livery
do
you
know
that
sounding
name
written
in
big
valorous
letters
on
the
declaration
of
independence
written
as
if
by
the
hand
of
a
giant
can
you
not
see
it
now
john
hancock
this
is
he
three
young
men
with
their
valet
are
standing
on
the
doorstep
of
the
william
pitt
bowing
politely
and
inquiring
in
the
most
courteous
terms
in
the
world
if
they
can
be
accommodated
it
is
the
time
of
the
french
revolution
and
these
are
three
sons
of
the
duke
of
orleans
louis
philippe
and
his
two
brothers
louis
philippe
never
forgot
his
visit
to
rivermouth
years
afterwards
when
he
was
seated
on
the
throne
of
france
he
asked
an
american
lady
who
chanced
to
be
at
his
court
if
the
pleasant
old
mansion
were
still
standing
but
a
greater
and
a
better
man
than
the
king
of
the
french
has
honored
this
roof
here
in
came
george
washington
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
pay
his
final
complimentary
visit
to
the
state
dignitaries
the
wainscoted
chamber
where
he
slept
and
the
where
he
entertained
his
guests
have
a
certain
dignity
and
sanctity
which
even
the
present
irish
tenants
can
not
wholly
destroy
during
the
period
of
my
reign
at
rivermouth
an
ancient
lady
dame
jocelyn
by
name
lived
in
one
of
the
upper
rooms
of
this
notable
building
she
was
a
dashing
young
belle
at
the
time
of
first
visit
to
the
town
and
must
have
been
exceedingly
coquettish
and
pretty
judging
from
a
certain
portrait
on
ivory
still
in
the
possession
of
the
family
according
to
dame
jocelyn
george
washington
flirted
with
her
just
a
little
bit
in
what
a
stately
and
highly
finished
manner
can
be
imagined
there
was
a
mirror
with
a
deep
filigreed
frame
hanging
over
the
in
this
room
the
glass
was
cracked
and
the
quicksilver
rubbed
off
or
discolored
in
many
places
when
it
reflected
your
face
you
had
the
singular
pleasure
of
not
recognizing
yourself
it
gave
your
features
the
appearance
of
having
been
run
through
a
machine
but
what
rendered
the
a
thing
of
enchantment
to
me
was
a
faded
green
feather
tipped
with
scarlet
which
drooped
from
the
top
of
the
tarnished
gilt
mouldings
this
feather
washington
took
from
the
plume
of
his
hat
and
presented
with
his
own
hand
to
the
worshipful
mistress
jocelyn
the
day
he
left
rivermouth
forever
i
wish
i
could
describe
the
mincing
genteel
air
and
the
with
which
the
dear
old
lady
related
the
incident
many
a
saturday
afternoon
have
i
climbed
up
the
rickety
staircase
to
that
dingy
room
which
always
had
a
flavor
of
snuff
about
it
to
sit
on
a
chair
and
listen
for
hours
together
to
dame
stories
of
the
olden
time
how
she
would
prattle
she
was
bedridden
poor
creature
and
had
not
been
out
of
the
chamber
for
fourteen
years
meanwhile
the
world
had
shot
ahead
of
dame
jocelyn
the
changes
that
had
taken
place
under
her
very
nose
were
unknown
to
this
faded
crooning
old
gentlewoman
whom
the
eighteenth
century
had
neglected
to
take
away
with
the
rest
of
its
odd
traps
she
had
no
patience
with
newfangled
notions
the
old
ways
and
the
old
times
were
good
enough
for
her
she
had
never
seen
a
steam
engine
though
she
had
heard
the
dratted
thing
screech
in
the
distance
in
her
day
when
gentlefolk
traveled
they
went
in
their
own
coaches
she
did
see
how
respectable
people
could
bring
themselves
down
to
riding
in
a
car
with
and
bobtail
and
poor
old
aristocrat
the
landlord
charged
her
no
rent
for
the
room
and
the
neighbors
took
turns
in
supplying
her
with
meals
towards
the
close
of
her
life
she
lived
to
be
she
grew
very
fretful
and
capricious
about
her
food
if
she
did
chance
to
fancy
what
was
sent
her
she
had
no
hesitation
in
sending
it
back
to
the
giver
with
miss
jocelyn
respectful
but
i
have
been
gossiping
too
long
and
yet
not
too
long
if
i
have
impressed
upon
the
reader
an
idea
of
what
a
rusty
delightful
old
town
it
was
to
which
i
had
come
to
spend
the
next
three
or
four
years
of
my
boyhood
a
drive
of
twenty
minutes
from
the
station
brought
us
to
the
of
grandfather
nutter
house
what
kind
of
house
it
was
and
what
sort
of
people
lived
in
it
shall
be
told
in
another
chapter
chapter
five
the
nutter
house
and
the
nutter
family
the
nutter
house
all
the
more
prominent
dwellings
in
rivermouth
are
named
after
somebody
for
instance
there
is
the
walford
house
the
venner
house
the
trefethen
house
though
it
by
no
means
follows
that
they
are
inhabited
by
the
people
whose
names
they
bear
the
nutter
house
to
resume
has
been
in
our
family
nearly
a
hundred
years
and
is
an
honor
to
the
builder
an
ancestor
of
ours
i
believe
supposing
durability
to
be
a
merit
if
our
ancestor
was
a
carpenter
he
knew
his
trade
i
wish
i
knew
mine
as
well
such
timber
and
such
workmanship
do
often
come
together
in
houses
built
nowadays
imagine
a
structure
with
a
wide
hall
running
through
the
middle
at
your
right
band
as
you
enter
stands
a
tall
black
mahogany
clock
looking
like
an
egyptian
mummy
set
up
on
end
on
each
side
of
the
hall
are
doors
whose
knobs
it
must
be
confessed
do
not
turn
very
easily
opening
into
large
rooms
wainscoted
and
rich
in
about
the
and
cornices
the
walls
are
covered
with
pictured
paper
representing
landscapes
and
in
the
parlor
for
example
this
enlivening
figure
is
repeated
all
over
the
room
a
group
of
english
peasants
wearing
italian
hats
are
dancing
on
a
lawn
that
abruptly
resolves
itself
into
a
upon
which
stands
a
flabby
fisherman
nationality
unknown
quietly
hauling
in
what
appears
to
be
a
small
whale
and
totally
regardless
of
the
dreadful
naval
combat
going
on
just
beyond
the
end
of
his
on
the
other
side
of
the
ships
is
the
again
with
the
same
peasants
dancing
our
ancestors
were
very
worthy
people
but
their
were
abominable
there
are
neither
grates
nor
stoves
in
these
quaint
chambers
but
splendid
open
with
room
enough
for
the
corpulent
to
turn
over
comfortably
on
the
polished
andirons
a
wide
staircase
leads
from
the
hall
to
the
second
story
which
is
arranged
much
like
the
first
over
this
is
the
garret
i
need
tell
a
new
england
boy
what
a
museum
of
curiosities
is
the
garret
of
a
new
england
house
of
fifty
or
sixty
years
standing
here
meet
together
as
if
by
some
preconcerted
arrangement
all
the
chairs
of
the
household
all
the
spavined
tables
all
the
seedy
hats
all
the
boots
all
the
split
that
have
retired
from
business
weary
with
the
march
of
the
pots
the
pans
the
trunks
the
bottles
who
may
hope
to
make
an
inventory
of
the
numberless
odds
and
ends
collected
in
this
bewildering
but
what
a
place
it
is
to
sit
of
an
afternoon
with
the
rain
pattering
on
the
roof
what
a
place
in
which
to
read
gulliver
travels
or
the
famous
adventures
of
rinaldo
rinaldini
my
grandfather
house
stood
a
little
back
from
the
main
street
in
the
shadow
of
two
handsome
elms
whose
overgrown
boughs
would
dash
themselves
against
the
gables
whenever
the
wind
blew
hard
in
the
rear
was
a
pleasant
garden
covering
perhaps
a
quarter
of
an
acre
full
of
and
gooseberry
bushes
these
trees
were
old
settlers
and
are
all
dead
now
excepting
one
which
bears
a
purple
plum
as
big
as
an
egg
this
tree
as
i
remark
is
still
standing
and
a
more
beautiful
tree
to
tumble
out
of
never
grew
anywhere
in
the
northwestern
corner
of
the
garden
were
the
stables
and
opening
upon
a
narrow
lane
you
may
imagine
that
i
made
an
early
visit
to
that
locality
to
inspect
gypsy
indeed
i
paid
her
a
visit
every
during
the
first
day
of
my
arrival
at
the
visit
she
trod
on
my
foot
rather
heavily
as
a
reminder
probably
that
i
was
wearing
out
my
welcome
she
was
a
knowing
little
pony
that
gypsy
and
i
shall
have
much
to
say
of
her
in
the
course
of
these
pages
gypsy
quarters
were
all
that
could
be
wished
but
nothing
among
my
new
surroundings
gave
me
more
satisfaction
than
the
cosey
sleeping
apartment
that
had
been
prepared
for
myself
it
was
the
hall
room
over
the
front
door
i
had
never
had
a
chamber
all
to
myself
before
and
this
one
about
twice
the
size
of
our
on
board
the
typhoon
was
a
marvel
of
neatness
and
comfort
pretty
chintz
curtains
hung
at
the
window
and
a
patch
quilt
of
more
colors
than
were
in
joseph
coat
covered
the
little
the
pattern
of
the
left
nothing
to
be
desired
in
that
line
on
a
gray
background
were
small
bunches
of
leaves
unlike
any
that
ever
grew
in
this
world
and
on
every
other
bunch
perched
a
pitted
with
crimson
spots
as
if
it
had
just
recovered
from
a
severe
attack
of
the
that
no
such
bird
ever
existed
did
not
detract
from
my
admiration
of
each
one
there
were
two
hundred
and
of
these
birds
in
all
not
counting
those
split
in
two
where
the
paper
was
badly
joined
i
counted
them
once
when
i
was
laid
up
with
a
fine
black
eye
and
falling
asleep
immediately
dreamed
that
the
whole
flock
suddenly
took
wing
and
flew
out
of
the
window
from
that
time
i
was
never
able
to
regard
them
as
merely
inanimate
objects
a
in
the
corner
a
chest
of
carved
mahogany
drawers
a
in
a
filigreed
frame
and
a
chair
studded
with
brass
nails
like
a
coffin
constituted
the
furniture
over
the
head
of
the
bed
were
two
oak
shelves
holding
perhaps
a
dozen
books
among
which
were
theodore
or
the
peruvians
robinson
crusoe
an
odd
volume
of
tristram
shandy
baxter
saints
rest
and
a
fine
english
edition
of
the
arabian
nights
with
six
hundred
by
harvey
shall
i
ever
forget
the
hour
when
i
first
overhauled
these
books
i
do
not
allude
especially
to
baxter
saints
rest
which
is
far
from
being
a
lively
work
for
the
young
but
to
the
arabian
nights
and
particularly
robinson
crusoe
the
thrill
that
ran
into
my
fingers
ends
then
has
not
run
out
yet
many
a
time
did
i
steal
up
to
this
nest
of
a
room
and
taking
the
volume
from
its
shelf
glide
off
into
an
enchanted
realm
where
there
were
no
lessons
to
get
and
no
boys
to
smash
my
kite
in
a
lidless
trunk
in
the
garret
i
subsequently
unearthed
another
motley
collection
of
novels
and
romances
embracing
the
adventures
of
baron
trenck
jack
sheppard
don
quixote
gil
blas
and
charlotte
temple
all
of
which
i
fed
upon
like
a
bookworm
i
never
come
across
a
copy
of
any
of
those
works
without
feeling
a
certain
tenderness
for
the
little
rascal
who
used
to
lean
above
the
magic
pages
hour
after
hour
religiously
believing
every
word
he
read
and
no
more
doubting
the
reality
of
sindbad
the
sailor
or
the
knight
of
the
sorrowful
countenance
than
he
did
the
existence
of
his
own
grandfather
against
the
wall
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
hung
a
placed
there
by
grandfather
nutter
who
knew
what
a
boy
loved
if
ever
a
grandfather
did
as
the
trigger
of
the
gun
had
been
accidentally
twisted
off
it
was
not
perhaps
the
most
dangerous
weapon
that
could
be
placed
in
the
hands
of
youth
in
this
maimed
condition
its
bump
of
destructiveness
was
much
less
than
that
of
my
small
brass
which
i
at
once
proceeded
to
suspend
from
one
of
the
nails
supporting
the
for
my
vagaries
concerning
the
red
man
had
been
entirely
dispelled
having
introduced
the
reader
to
the
nutter
house
a
presentation
to
the
nutter
family
naturally
follows
the
family
consisted
of
my
grandfather
his
sister
miss
abigail
nutter
and
kitty
collins
the
grandfather
nutter
was
a
hale
cheery
old
gentleman
as
straight
and
as
bald
as
an
arrow
he
had
been
a
sailor
in
early
life
that
is
to
say
at
the
age
of
ten
years
he
fled
from
the
and
ran
away
to
sea
a
single
voyage
satisfied
him
there
never
was
but
one
of
our
family
who
did
run
away
to
sea
and
this
one
died
at
his
birth
my
grandfather
had
also
been
a
soldier
a
captain
of
militia
in
if
i
owe
the
british
nation
anything
i
owe
thanks
to
that
particular
british
soldier
who
put
a
into
the
fleshy
part
of
captain
leg
causing
that
noble
warrior
a
slight
permanent
limp
but
offsetting
the
injury
by
furnishing
him
with
the
material
for
a
story
which
the
old
gentleman
was
never
weary
of
telling
and
i
never
weary
of
listening
to
the
story
in
brief
was
as
follows
at
the
breaking
out
of
the
war
an
english
frigate
lay
for
several
days
off
the
coast
near
rivermouth
a
strong
fort
defended
the
harbor
and
a
regiment
of
scattered
at
various
points
stood
ready
to
repel
the
boats
should
the
enemy
try
to
effect
a
landing
captain
nutter
had
charge
of
a
slight
earthwork
just
outside
the
mouth
of
the
river
late
one
thick
night
the
sound
of
oars
was
heard
the
sentinel
tried
to
fire
off
his
gun
at
and
could
when
captain
nutter
sprung
upon
the
parapet
in
the
pitch
darkness
and
shouted
boat
ahoyl
a
immediately
embedded
itself
in
the
calf
of
his
leg
the
captain
tumbled
into
the
fort
and
the
boat
which
had
probably
come
in
search
of
water
pulled
back
to
the
frigate
this
was
my
grandfather
only
exploit
during
the
war
that
his
prompt
and
bold
conduct
was
instrumental
in
teaching
the
enemy
the
hopelessness
of
attempting
to
conquer
such
a
people
was
among
the
firm
beliefs
of
my
boyhood
at
the
time
i
came
to
rivermouth
my
grandfather
had
retired
from
active
pursuits
and
was
living
at
ease
on
his
money
invested
principally
in
shipping
he
had
been
a
widower
many
years
a
maiden
sister
the
aforesaid
miss
abigail
managing
his
household
miss
abigail
also
managed
her
brother
and
her
brother
servant
and
the
visitor
at
her
brother
gate
not
in
a
tyrannical
spirit
but
from
a
philanthropic
desire
to
be
useful
to
everybody
in
person
she
was
tall
and
angular
she
had
a
gray
complexion
gray
eyes
gray
eyebrows
and
generally
wore
a
gray
dress
her
strongest
weak
point
was
a
belief
in
the
efficacy
of
as
a
cure
for
all
known
diseases
if
there
were
ever
two
people
who
seemed
to
dislike
each
other
miss
abigail
and
kitty
collins
were
those
people
if
ever
two
people
really
loved
each
other
miss
abigail
and
kitty
collins
were
those
people
also
they
were
always
either
skirmishing
or
having
a
cup
of
tea
lovingly
together
miss
abigail
was
very
fond
of
me
and
so
was
kitty
and
in
the
course
of
their
disagreements
each
let
me
into
the
private
history
of
the
other
according
to
kitty
it
was
not
originally
my
grandfather
intention
to
have
miss
abigail
at
the
head
of
his
domestic
establishment
she
had
swooped
down
on
him
kitty
own
words
with
a
in
one
hand
and
a
faded
blue
cotton
umbrella
still
in
existence
in
the
other
clad
in
this
singular
garb
i
do
not
remember
that
kitty
alluded
to
any
additional
peculiarity
of
dress
miss
abigail
had
made
her
appearance
at
the
door
of
the
nutter
house
on
the
morning
of
my
grandmother
funeral
the
small
amount
of
baggage
which
the
lady
brought
with
her
would
have
led
the
superficial
observer
to
infer
that
miss
abigail
visit
was
limited
to
a
few
days
i
run
ahead
of
my
story
in
saying
she
remained
seventeen
years
how
much
longer
she
would
have
remained
can
never
be
definitely
known
now
as
she
died
at
the
expiration
of
that
period
whether
or
not
my
grandfather
was
quite
pleased
by
this
addition
to
his
family
is
a
problem
he
was
very
kind
always
to
miss
abigail
and
seldom
opposed
her
though
i
think
she
must
have
tried
his
patience
sometimes
especially
when
she
interfered
with
kitty
kitty
collins
or
catherine
as
she
preferred
to
be
called
was
descended
in
a
direct
line
from
an
extensive
family
of
kings
who
formerly
ruled
over
ireland
in
consequence
of
various
calamities
among
which
the
failure
of
the
may
be
mentioned
miss
kitty
collins
in
company
with
several
hundred
of
her
countrymen
and
countrywomen
also
descended
from
kings
came
over
to
america
in
an
emigrant
ship
in
the
year
eighteen
hundred
and
something
i
do
know
what
freak
of
fortune
caused
the
royal
exile
to
turn
up
at
rivermouth
but
turn
up
she
did
a
few
months
after
arriving
in
this
country
and
was
hired
by
my
grandmother
to
do
general
housework
for
the
sum
of
four
shillings
and
a
week
kitty
had
been
living
about
seven
years
in
my
grandfather
family
when
she
unburdened
her
heart
of
a
secret
which
had
been
weighing
upon
it
all
that
time
it
may
be
said
of
people
as
it
is
said
of
nations
happy
are
they
that
have
no
kitty
had
a
history
and
a
pathetic
one
i
think
on
board
the
emigrant
ship
that
brought
her
to
america
she
became
acquainted
with
a
sailor
who
being
touched
by
kitty
forlorn
condition
was
very
good
to
her
long
before
the
end
of
the
voyage
which
had
been
tedious
and
perilous
she
was
heartbroken
at
the
thought
of
separating
from
her
kindly
protector
but
they
were
not
to
part
just
yet
for
the
sailor
returned
kitty
affection
and
the
two
were
married
on
their
arrival
at
port
kitty
husband
she
would
never
mention
his
name
but
kept
it
locked
in
her
bosom
like
some
precious
relic
had
a
considerable
sum
of
money
when
the
crew
were
paid
off
and
the
young
couple
for
kitty
was
young
then
lived
very
happily
in
a
on
south
street
near
the
docks
this
was
in
new
york
the
days
flew
by
like
hours
and
the
stocking
in
which
the
little
bride
kept
the
funds
shrunk
and
shrunk
until
at
last
there
were
only
three
or
four
dollars
left
in
the
toe
of
it
then
kitty
was
troubled
for
she
knew
her
sailor
would
have
to
go
to
sea
again
unless
he
could
get
employment
on
shore
this
he
endeavored
to
do
but
not
with
much
success
one
morning
as
usual
he
kissed
her
good
day
and
set
out
in
search
of
work
kissed
me
goodby
and
called
me
his
little
irish
lass
sobbed
kitty
telling
the
story
kissed
me
goodby
and
heaven
help
me
i
niver
set
oi
on
him
nor
on
the
likes
of
him
again
he
never
came
back
day
after
day
dragged
on
night
after
night
and
then
the
weary
weeks
what
had
become
of
him
had
he
been
murdered
had
he
fallen
into
the
docks
had
he
deserted
her
no
she
could
not
believe
that
he
was
too
brave
and
tender
and
true
she
could
believe
that
he
was
dead
dead
or
he
come
back
to
her
meanwhile
the
landlord
of
the
turned
kitty
into
the
streets
now
that
her
man
was
gone
and
the
payment
of
the
rent
doubtful
she
got
a
place
as
a
servant
the
family
she
lived
with
shortly
moved
to
boston
and
she
accompanied
them
then
they
went
abroad
but
kitty
would
not
leave
america
somehow
she
drifted
to
rivermouth
and
for
seven
long
years
never
gave
speech
to
her
sorrow
until
the
kindness
of
strangers
who
had
become
friends
to
her
unsealed
the
heroic
lips
kitty
story
you
may
be
sure
made
my
grandparents
treat
her
more
kindly
than
ever
in
time
she
grew
to
be
regarded
less
as
a
servant
than
as
a
friend
in
the
home
circle
sharing
its
joys
and
sorrows
a
faithful
nurse
a
willing
slave
a
happy
spirit
in
spite
of
all
i
fancy
i
hear
her
singing
over
her
work
in
the
kitchen
pausing
from
time
to
time
to
make
some
witty
reply
to
miss
abigail
for
kitty
like
all
her
race
had
a
vein
of
unconscious
humor
her
bright
honest
face
comes
to
me
out
from
the
past
the
light
and
life
of
the
nutter
house
when
i
was
a
boy
at
rivermouth
chapter
six
lights
and
shadows
the
first
shadow
that
fell
upon
me
in
my
new
home
was
caused
by
the
return
of
my
parents
to
new
orleans
their
visit
was
cut
short
by
business
which
required
my
father
presence
in
natchez
where
he
was
establishing
a
branch
of
the
bankinghouse
when
they
had
gone
a
sense
of
loneliness
such
as
i
had
never
dreamed
of
filled
my
young
breast
i
crept
away
to
the
stable
and
throwing
my
arms
about
gypsy
neck
sobbed
aloud
she
too
had
come
from
the
sunny
south
and
was
now
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
the
little
mare
seemed
to
realize
our
situation
and
gave
me
all
the
sympathy
i
could
ask
repeatedly
rubbing
her
soft
nose
over
my
face
and
lapping
up
my
salt
tears
with
evident
relish
when
night
came
i
felt
still
more
lonesome
my
grandfather
sat
in
his
the
greater
part
of
the
evening
reading
the
rivermouth
bamacle
the
local
newspaper
there
was
no
gas
in
those
days
and
the
captain
read
by
the
aid
of
a
small
lamp
which
he
held
in
one
hand
i
observed
that
he
had
a
habit
of
dropping
off
into
a
doze
every
three
or
four
minutes
and
i
forgot
my
homesickness
at
intervals
in
watching
him
two
or
three
times
to
my
vast
amusement
he
scorched
the
edges
of
the
newspaper
with
the
wick
of
the
lamp
and
at
about
half
past
eight
i
had
the
satisfactions
i
am
sorry
to
confess
it
was
a
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
rivermouth
barnacle
in
flames
my
grandfather
leisurely
extinguished
the
fire
with
his
hands
and
miss
abigail
who
sat
near
a
low
table
knitting
by
the
light
of
an
astral
lamp
did
not
even
look
up
she
was
quite
used
to
this
catastrophe
there
was
little
or
no
conversation
during
the
evening
in
fact
i
do
not
remember
that
anyone
spoke
at
all
excepting
once
when
the
captain
remarked
in
a
meditative
manner
that
my
parents
must
have
reached
new
york
by
this
time
at
which
supposition
i
nearly
strangled
myself
in
attempting
to
intercept
a
sob
the
monotonous
click
click
of
miss
abigail
needles
made
me
nervous
after
a
while
and
finally
drove
me
out
of
the
into
the
kitchen
where
kitty
caused
me
to
laugh
by
saying
miss
abigail
thought
that
what
i
needed
was
a
good
dose
of
a
remedy
she
was
forever
ready
to
administer
in
all
emergencies
if
a
boy
broke
his
leg
or
lost
his
mother
i
believe
miss
abigail
would
have
given
him
kitty
laid
herself
out
to
be
entertaining
she
told
me
several
funny
irish
stories
and
described
some
of
the
odd
people
living
in
the
town
but
in
the
midst
of
her
comicalities
the
tears
would
involuntarily
ooze
out
of
my
eyes
though
i
was
not
a
lad
much
addicted
to
weeping
then
kitty
would
put
her
arms
around
me
and
tell
me
not
to
mind
it
that
it
was
as
if
i
had
been
left
alone
in
a
foreign
land
with
no
one
to
care
for
me
like
a
poor
girl
whom
she
had
once
known
i
brightened
up
before
long
and
told
kitty
all
about
the
typhoon
and
the
old
seaman
whose
name
i
tried
in
vain
to
recall
and
was
obliged
to
fall
back
on
plain
sailor
ben
i
was
glad
when
ten
came
the
bedtime
for
young
folks
and
old
folks
too
at
the
nutter
house
alone
in
the
hallchamber
i
had
my
cry
out
once
for
all
moistening
the
pillow
to
such
an
extent
that
i
was
obliged
to
turn
it
over
to
find
a
dry
spot
to
go
to
sleep
on
my
grandfather
wisely
concluded
to
put
me
to
school
at
once
if
i
had
been
permitted
to
go
mooning
about
the
house
and
stables
i
should
have
kept
my
discontent
alive
for
months
the
next
morning
accordingly
he
took
me
by
the
hand
and
we
set
forth
for
the
academy
which
was
located
at
the
farther
end
of
the
town
the
temple
school
was
a
brick
building
standing
in
the
centre
of
a
great
square
piece
of
land
surrounded
by
a
high
picket
fence
there
were
three
or
four
sickly
trees
but
no
grass
in
this
enclosure
which
had
been
worn
smooth
and
hard
by
the
tread
of
multitudinous
feet
i
noticed
here
and
there
small
holes
scooped
in
the
ground
indicating
that
it
was
the
season
for
marbles
a
better
playground
for
baseball
could
have
been
devised
on
reaching
the
schoolhouse
door
the
captain
inquired
for
grimshaw
the
boy
who
answered
our
knock
ushered
us
into
a
and
in
a
few
minutes
during
which
my
eye
took
in
caps
hung
on
wooden
pegs
grimshaw
made
his
appearance
he
was
a
slender
man
with
white
fragile
hands
and
eyes
that
glanced
half
a
dozen
different
ways
at
once
a
habit
probably
acquired
from
watching
the
boys
after
a
brief
consultation
my
grandfather
patted
me
on
the
head
and
left
me
in
charge
of
this
gentleman
who
seated
himself
in
front
of
me
and
proceeded
to
sound
the
depth
or
more
properly
speaking
the
shallowness
of
my
attainments
i
suspect
my
historical
information
rather
startled
him
i
recollect
i
gave
him
to
understand
that
richard
iii
was
the
last
king
of
england
this
ordeal
over
grimshaw
rose
and
bade
me
follow
him
a
door
opened
and
i
stood
in
the
blaze
of
pairs
of
upturned
eyes
i
was
a
cool
hand
for
my
age
but
i
lacked
the
boldness
to
face
this
battery
without
wincing
in
a
sort
of
dazed
way
i
stumbled
after
grimshaw
down
a
narrow
aisle
between
two
rows
of
desks
and
shyly
took
the
seat
pointed
out
to
me
the
faint
buzz
that
had
floated
over
the
at
our
entrance
died
away
and
the
interrupted
lessons
were
resumed
by
degrees
i
recovered
my
coolness
and
ventured
to
look
around
me
the
owners
of
the
caps
were
seated
at
small
green
desks
like
the
one
assigned
to
me
the
desks
were
arranged
in
six
rows
with
spaces
between
just
wide
enough
to
prevent
the
boys
whispering
a
blackboard
set
into
the
wall
extended
clear
across
the
end
of
the
room
on
a
raised
platform
near
the
door
stood
the
master
table
and
directly
in
front
of
this
was
a
capable
of
seating
fifteen
or
twenty
pupils
a
pair
of
globes
tattooed
with
dragons
and
winged
horses
occupied
a
shelf
between
two
windows
which
were
so
high
from
the
floor
that
nothing
but
a
giraffe
could
have
looked
out
of
them
having
possessed
myself
of
these
details
i
scrutinized
my
new
acquaintances
with
unconcealed
curiosity
instinctively
selecting
my
friends
and
picking
out
my
enemies
and
in
only
two
cases
did
i
mistake
my
man
a
sallow
boy
with
bright
red
hair
sitting
in
the
fourth
row
shook
his
fist
at
me
furtively
several
times
during
the
morning
i
had
a
presentiment
i
should
have
trouble
with
that
boy
some
day
a
presentiment
subsequently
realized
on
my
left
was
a
chubby
little
fellow
with
a
great
many
freckles
this
was
pepper
whitcomb
who
made
some
mysterious
motions
to
me
i
understand
them
but
as
they
were
clearly
of
a
pacific
nature
i
winked
my
eye
at
him
this
appeared
to
be
satisfactory
for
he
then
went
on
with
his
studies
at
recess
he
gave
me
the
core
of
his
apple
though
there
were
several
applicants
for
it
presently
a
boy
in
a
loose
jacket
with
two
rows
of
brass
buttons
held
up
a
folded
paper
behind
his
slate
intimating
that
it
was
intended
for
me
the
paper
was
passed
skillfully
from
desk
to
desk
until
it
reached
my
hands
on
opening
the
scrap
i
found
that
it
contained
a
small
piece
of
molasses
candy
in
an
extremely
humid
state
this
was
certainly
kind
i
nodded
my
acknowledgments
and
hastily
slipped
the
delicacy
into
my
mouth
in
a
second
i
felt
my
tongue
grow
with
cayenne
pepper
my
face
must
have
assumed
a
comical
expression
for
the
boy
in
the
jacket
gave
an
hysterical
laugh
for
which
he
was
instantly
punished
by
grimshaw
i
swallowed
the
fiery
candy
though
it
brought
the
water
to
my
eyes
and
managed
to
look
so
unconcerned
that
i
was
the
only
pupil
in
the
form
who
escaped
questioning
as
to
the
cause
of
marden
misdemeanor
marden
was
his
name
nothing
else
occurred
that
morning
to
interrupt
the
exercises
excepting
that
a
boy
in
the
reading
class
threw
us
all
into
convulsions
by
calling
absalom
abolsom
o
my
son
abolsom
i
laughed
as
loud
as
anyone
but
i
am
not
so
sure
that
i
should
have
pronounced
it
abolsom
myself
at
recess
several
of
the
scholars
came
to
my
desk
and
shook
hands
with
me
grimshaw
having
previously
introduced
me
to
phil
adams
charging
him
to
see
that
i
got
into
no
trouble
my
new
acquaintances
suggested
that
we
should
go
to
the
playground
we
were
no
sooner
than
the
boy
with
the
red
hair
thrust
his
way
through
the
crowd
and
placed
himself
at
my
side
i
say
youngster
if
you
comin
to
this
school
you
got
to
toe
the
i
did
see
any
mark
to
toe
and
did
understand
what
he
meant
but
i
replied
politely
that
if
it
was
the
custom
of
the
school
i
should
be
happy
to
toe
the
mark
if
he
would
point
it
out
to
me
i
do
want
any
of
your
sarse
said
the
boy
scowling
look
here
conway
cried
a
clear
voice
from
the
other
side
of
the
playground
you
let
young
bailey
alone
he
a
stranger
here
and
might
be
afraid
of
you
and
thrash
you
why
do
you
always
throw
yourself
in
the
way
of
getting
thrashed
i
turned
to
the
speaker
who
by
this
time
had
reached
the
spot
where
we
stood
conway
slunk
off
favoring
me
with
a
parting
scowl
of
defiance
i
gave
my
hand
to
the
boy
who
had
befriended
me
his
name
was
jack
harris
and
thanked
him
for
his
i
tell
you
what
it
is
bailey
he
said
returning
my
pressure
you
have
to
fight
conway
before
the
quarter
ends
or
you
have
no
rest
that
fellow
is
always
hankering
after
a
licking
and
of
course
you
give
him
one
by
and
by
but
what
the
use
of
hurrying
up
an
unpleasant
job
let
have
some
baseball
by
the
way
bailey
you
were
a
good
kid
not
to
let
on
to
grimshaw
about
the
candy
charley
marden
would
have
caught
it
twice
as
heavy
he
sorry
he
played
the
joke
on
you
and
told
me
to
tell
you
so
hallo
blake
where
are
the
bats
this
was
addressed
to
a
handsome
lad
of
about
my
own
age
who
was
engaged
just
then
in
cutting
his
initials
on
the
bark
of
a
tree
near
the
schoolhouse
blake
shut
up
his
penknife
and
went
off
to
get
the
bats
during
the
game
which
ensued
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
charley
marden
binny
wallace
pepper
whitcomb
harry
blake
and
fred
langdon
these
boys
none
of
them
more
than
a
year
or
two
older
than
i
binny
wallace
was
younger
were
ever
after
my
chosen
comrades
phil
adams
and
jack
harris
were
considerably
our
seniors
and
though
they
always
treated
us
kids
very
kindly
they
generally
went
with
another
set
of
course
before
long
i
knew
all
the
temple
boys
more
or
less
intimately
but
the
five
i
have
named
were
my
constant
companions
my
first
day
at
the
temple
grammar
school
was
on
the
whole
satisfactory
i
had
made
several
warm
friends
and
only
two
permanent
enemies
conway
and
his
echo
seth
rodgers
for
these
two
always
went
together
like
a
deranged
stomach
and
a
headache
before
the
end
of
the
week
i
had
my
studies
well
in
hand
i
was
a
little
ashamed
at
finding
myself
at
the
foot
of
the
various
classes
and
secretly
determined
to
deserve
promotion
the
school
was
an
admirable
one
i
might
make
this
part
of
my
story
more
entertaining
by
picturing
grimshaw
as
a
tyrant
with
a
red
nose
and
a
large
stick
but
unfortunately
for
the
purposes
of
sensational
narrative
grimshaw
was
a
quiet
kindhearted
gentleman
though
a
rigid
disciplinarian
he
had
a
keen
sense
of
justice
was
a
good
reader
of
character
and
the
boys
respected
him
there
were
two
other
teachers
a
french
tutor
and
a
who
visited
the
school
twice
a
week
on
wednesdays
and
saturdays
we
were
dismissed
at
noon
and
these
were
the
brightest
epochs
of
my
existence
daily
contact
with
boys
who
had
not
been
brought
up
as
gently
as
i
worked
an
immediate
and
in
some
respects
a
beneficial
change
in
my
character
i
had
the
nonsense
taken
out
of
me
as
the
saying
is
some
of
the
nonsense
at
least
i
became
more
manly
and
i
discovered
that
the
world
was
not
created
exclusively
on
my
account
in
new
orleans
i
labored
under
the
delusion
that
it
was
having
neither
brother
nor
sister
to
give
up
to
at
home
and
being
moreover
the
largest
pupil
at
school
there
my
will
had
seldom
been
opposed
at
rivermouth
matters
were
different
and
i
was
not
long
in
adapting
myself
to
the
altered
circumstances
of
course
i
got
many
severe
rubs
often
unconsciously
given
but
i
had
the
sense
to
see
that
i
was
all
the
better
for
them
my
social
relations
with
my
new
schoolfellows
were
the
pleasantest
possible
there
was
always
some
exciting
excursion
on
foot
a
ramble
through
the
pine
woods
a
visit
to
the
devil
pulpit
a
high
cliff
in
the
neighborhood
or
a
surreptitious
low
on
the
river
involving
an
exploration
of
a
group
of
diminutive
islands
upon
one
of
which
we
pitched
a
tent
and
played
we
were
the
spanish
sailors
who
got
wrecked
there
years
ago
but
the
endless
pine
forest
that
skirted
the
town
was
our
favorite
haunt
there
was
a
great
green
pond
hidden
somewhere
in
its
depths
inhabited
by
a
monstrous
colony
of
turtles
harry
blake
who
had
an
eccentric
passion
for
carving
his
name
on
everything
never
let
a
captured
turtle
slip
through
his
fingers
without
leaving
his
mark
engraved
on
its
shell
he
must
have
lettered
about
two
thousand
from
first
to
last
we
used
to
call
them
harry
blake
sheep
these
turtles
were
of
a
discontented
and
migratory
turn
of
mind
and
we
frequently
encountered
two
or
three
of
them
on
the
several
miles
from
their
ancestral
mud
unspeakable
was
our
delight
whenever
we
discovered
one
soberly
walking
off
with
harry
blake
initials
no
doubt
there
are
at
this
moment
fat
ancient
turtles
wandering
about
that
gummy
woodland
with
neatly
cut
on
their
venerable
backs
it
soon
became
a
custom
among
my
playmates
to
make
our
barn
their
rendezvous
gypsy
proved
a
strong
attraction
captain
nutter
bought
me
a
little
cart
which
she
drew
quite
nicely
after
kicking
out
the
dasher
and
breaking
the
shafts
once
or
twice
with
our
and
stowed
away
under
the
seat
we
used
to
start
off
early
in
the
afternoon
for
the
where
there
were
countless
marvels
in
the
shape
of
shells
mosses
and
kelp
gypsy
enjoyed
the
sport
as
keenly
as
any
of
us
even
going
so
far
one
day
as
to
trot
down
the
beach
into
the
sea
where
we
were
bathing
as
she
took
the
cart
with
her
our
provisions
were
not
much
improved
i
shall
never
forget
how
tastes
after
being
soused
in
the
atlantic
ocean
dipped
in
salt
water
are
palatable
but
not
there
was
a
good
deal
of
wet
weather
during
those
first
six
weeks
at
rivermouth
and
we
set
ourselves
at
work
to
find
some
indoor
amusement
for
our
it
was
all
very
well
for
amadis
de
gaul
and
don
quixote
not
to
mind
the
rain
they
had
iron
overcoats
and
were
not
from
all
we
can
learn
subject
to
croup
and
the
guidance
of
their
grandfathers
our
case
was
different
now
boys
what
shall
we
do
i
asked
addressing
a
thoughtful
conclave
of
seven
assembled
in
our
barn
one
dismal
rainy
afternoon
let
have
a
theatre
suggested
binny
wallace
the
very
thing
but
where
the
loft
of
the
stable
was
ready
to
burst
with
hay
provided
for
gypsy
but
the
long
room
over
the
was
unoccupied
the
place
of
all
places
my
managerial
eye
saw
at
a
glance
its
capabilities
for
a
theatre
i
had
been
to
the
play
a
great
many
times
in
new
orleans
and
was
wise
in
matters
pertaining
to
the
drama
so
here
in
due
time
was
set
up
some
extraordinary
scenery
of
my
own
painting
the
curtain
i
recollect
though
it
worked
smoothly
enough
on
other
occasions
invariably
hitched
during
the
performances
and
it
often
required
the
united
energies
of
the
prince
of
denmark
the
king
and
the
with
an
occasional
band
from
the
fair
ophelia
pepper
whitcomb
in
a
dress
to
hoist
that
bit
of
green
cambric
the
theatre
however
was
a
success
as
far
as
it
went
i
retired
from
the
business
with
no
fewer
than
fifteen
hundred
pins
after
deducting
the
headless
the
pointless
and
the
crooked
pins
with
which
our
doorkeeper
frequently
got
from
first
to
last
we
took
in
a
great
deal
of
this
counterfeit
money
the
price
of
admission
to
the
rivermouth
theatre
was
twenty
pins
i
played
all
the
principal
parts
myself
not
that
i
was
a
finer
actor
than
the
other
boys
but
because
i
owned
the
establishment
at
the
tenth
representation
my
dramatic
career
was
brought
to
a
close
by
an
unfortunate
circumstance
we
were
playing
the
drama
of
william
tell
the
hero
of
of
course
i
was
william
tell
in
spite
of
fred
langdon
who
wanted
to
act
that
character
himself
i
let
him
so
he
withdrew
from
the
company
taking
the
only
bow
and
arrow
we
had
i
made
a
out
of
a
piece
of
whalebone
and
did
very
well
without
him
we
had
reached
that
exciting
scene
where
gessler
the
austrian
tyrant
commands
tell
to
shoot
the
apple
from
his
son
head
pepper
whitcomb
who
played
all
the
juvenile
and
women
parts
was
my
son
to
guard
against
mischance
a
piece
of
pasteboard
was
fastened
by
a
handkerchief
over
the
upper
portion
of
whitcomb
face
while
the
arrow
to
be
used
was
sewed
up
in
a
strip
of
flannel
i
was
a
capital
marksman
and
the
big
apple
only
two
yards
distant
turned
its
russet
cheek
fairly
towards
me
i
can
see
poor
little
pepper
now
as
he
stood
without
flinching
waiting
for
me
to
perform
my
great
feat
i
raised
the
crossbow
amid
the
breathless
silence
of
the
crowded
audience
consisting
of
seven
boys
and
three
girls
exclusive
of
kitty
collins
who
insisted
on
paying
her
way
in
with
a
i
raised
the
i
repeat
twang
went
the
whipcord
but
alas
instead
of
hitting
the
apple
the
arrow
flew
right
into
pepper
whitcomb
mouth
which
happened
to
be
open
at
the
time
and
destroyed
my
aim
i
shall
never
be
able
to
banish
that
awful
moment
from
my
memory
pepper
roar
expressive
of
astonishment
indignation
and
pain
is
still
ringing
in
my
cars
i
looked
upon
him
as
a
corpse
and
glancing
not
far
into
the
dreary
future
pictured
myself
led
forth
to
execution
in
the
presence
of
the
very
same
spectators
then
assembled
luckily
poor
pepper
was
not
seriously
hurt
but
grandfather
nutter
appearing
in
the
midst
of
the
confusion
attracted
by
the
howls
of
young
tell
issued
an
injunction
against
all
theatricals
thereafter
and
the
place
was
closed
not
however
without
a
farewell
speech
from
me
in
which
i
said
that
this
would
have
been
the
proudest
moment
of
my
life
if
i
had
hit
pepper
whitcomb
in
the
mouth
whereupon
the
audience
assisted
i
am
glad
to
state
by
pepper
cried
hear
hear
i
then
attributed
the
accident
to
pepper
himself
whose
mouth
being
open
at
the
instant
i
fired
acted
upon
the
arrow
much
after
the
fashion
of
a
whirlpool
and
drew
in
the
fatal
shaft
i
was
about
to
explain
how
a
comparatively
small
maelstrom
could
suck
in
the
largest
ship
when
the
curtain
fell
of
its
own
accord
amid
the
shouts
of
the
audience
this
was
my
last
appearance
on
any
stage
it
was
some
time
though
before
i
heard
the
end
of
the
william
tell
business
malicious
little
boys
who
had
not
been
allowed
to
buy
tickets
to
my
theatre
used
to
cry
out
after
me
in
the
street
killed
cock
robin
said
the
sparrer
my
bow
and
arrer
i
killed
cock
robin
the
sarcasm
of
this
verse
was
more
than
i
could
stand
and
it
made
pepper
whitcomb
pretty
mad
to
be
called
cock
robin
i
can
tell
you
so
the
days
glided
on
with
fewer
clouds
and
more
sunshine
than
fall
to
the
lot
of
most
boys
conway
was
certainly
a
cloud
within
he
seldom
ventured
to
be
aggressive
but
whenever
we
met
about
town
he
never
failed
to
brush
against
me
or
pull
my
cap
over
my
eyes
or
drive
me
distracted
by
inquiring
after
my
family
in
new
orleans
always
alluding
to
them
as
highly
respectable
colored
people
jack
harris
was
right
when
he
said
conway
would
give
me
no
rest
until
i
fought
him
i
felt
it
was
ordained
ages
before
our
birth
that
we
should
meet
on
this
planet
and
fight
with
the
view
of
not
running
counter
to
destiny
i
quietly
prepared
myself
for
the
impending
conflict
the
scene
of
my
dramatic
triumphs
was
turned
into
a
gymnasium
for
this
purpose
though
i
did
not
openly
avow
the
fact
to
the
boys
by
persistently
standing
on
my
head
raising
heavy
weights
and
going
hand
over
hand
up
a
ladder
i
developed
my
muscle
until
my
little
body
was
as
tough
as
a
hickory
knot
and
as
supple
as
tripe
i
also
took
occasional
lessons
in
the
noble
art
of
under
the
tuition
of
phil
adams
i
brooded
over
the
matter
until
the
idea
of
fighting
conway
became
a
part
of
me
i
fought
him
in
imagination
during
i
dreamed
of
fighting
with
him
at
night
when
he
would
suddenly
expand
into
a
giant
twelve
feet
high
and
then
as
suddenly
shrink
into
a
pygmy
so
small
that
i
could
hit
him
in
this
latter
shape
he
would
get
into
my
hair
or
pop
into
my
treating
me
with
as
little
ceremony
as
the
liliputians
showed
captain
lemuel
gulliver
all
of
which
was
not
pleasant
to
be
sure
on
the
whole
conway
was
a
cloud
and
then
i
had
a
cloud
at
home
it
was
not
grandfather
nutter
nor
miss
abigail
nor
kitty
collins
though
they
all
helped
to
compose
it
it
was
a
vague
funereal
impalpable
something
which
no
amount
of
gymnastic
training
would
enable
me
to
knock
over
it
was
sunday
if
ever
i
have
a
boy
to
bring
up
in
the
way
he
should
go
i
intend
to
make
sunday
a
cheerful
day
to
him
sunday
was
not
a
cheerful
day
at
the
nutter
house
you
shall
judge
for
yourself
it
is
sunday
morning
i
should
premise
by
saying
that
the
deep
gloom
which
has
settled
over
everything
set
in
like
a
heavy
fog
early
on
saturday
evening
at
seven
my
grandfather
comes
smilelessly
downstairs
he
is
dressed
in
black
and
looks
as
if
he
had
lost
all
his
friends
during
the
night
miss
abigail
also
in
black
looks
as
if
she
were
prepared
to
bury
them
and
not
indisposed
to
enjoy
the
ceremony
even
kitty
collins
has
caught
the
contagious
gloom
as
i
perceive
when
she
brings
in
the
a
solemn
and
sculpturesque
urn
at
any
time
but
monumental
now
and
sets
it
down
in
front
of
miss
abigail
miss
abigail
gazes
at
the
urn
as
if
it
held
the
ashes
of
her
ancestors
instead
of
a
generous
quantity
of
fine
old
java
coffee
the
meal
progresses
in
silence
our
parlor
is
by
no
means
thrown
open
every
day
it
is
open
this
june
morning
and
is
pervaded
by
a
strong
smell
of
centretable
the
furniture
of
the
room
and
the
little
china
ornaments
on
the

a
constrained

want
to
read
anything
i
can
read
baxter
saints
rest
i
would
die
first
so
i
sit
there
kicking
my
heels
thinking
about
new
orleans
and
watching
a
morbid
fly
that
attempts
to
commit
suicide
by
butting
his
head
against
the
listen
no
yes
it
is
it
is
the
robins
singing
in
the
garden
the
grateful
joyous
robins
singing
away
like
mad
just
as
if
it
was
sunday
their
audacity
tickles
me
my
grandfather
looks
up
and
inquires
in
a
sepulchral
voice
if
i
am
ready
for
sabbath
school
it
is
time
to
go
i
like
the
sabbath
school
there
are
bright
young
faces
there
at
all
events
when
i
get
out
into
the
sunshine
alone
i
draw
a
long
breath
i
would
turn
a
somersault
up
against
neighbor
penhallow
newly
painted
fence
if
i
had
my
best
trousers
on
so
glad
am
i
to
escape
from
the
oppressive
atmosphere
of
the
nutter
house
sabbath
school
over
i
go
to
meeting
joining
my
grandfather
who
does
appear
to
be
any
relation
to
me
this
day
and
miss
abigail
in
the
porch
our
minister
holds
out
very
little
hope
to
any
of
us
of
being
saved
convinced
that
i
am
a
lost
creature
in
common
with
the
human
family
i
return
home
behind
my
guardians
at
a
snail
pace
we
have
a
dead
cold
dinner
i
saw
it
laid
out
yesterday
there
is
a
long
interval
between
this
repast
and
the
second
service
and
a
still
longer
interval
between
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
that
service
for
the
rev
wibird
hawkins
sermons
are
none
of
the
shortest
whatever
else
they
may
be
after
meeting
my
grandfather
and
i
take
a
walk
we
visit
appropriately
enough
a
neighboring
graveyard
i
am
by
this
time
in
a
condition
of
mind
to
become
a
willing
inmate
of
the
place
the
usual
evening
is
postponed
for
some
reason
at
half
past
eight
i
go
to
bed
this
is
the
way
sunday
was
observed
in
the
nutter
house
and
pretty
generally
throughout
the
town
twenty
years
ago
people
who
were
prosperous
and
natural
and
happy
on
saturday
became
the
most
rueful
of
human
beings
in
the
brief
space
of
twelve
hours
i
do
think
there
was
any
hypocrisy
in
this
it
was
merely
the
old
puritan
austerity
cropping
out
once
a
week
many
of
these
people
were
pure
christians
every
day
in
the
seven
excepting
the
seventh
then
they
were
decorous
and
solemn
to
the
verge
of
moroseness
i
should
not
like
to
be
misunderstood
on
this
point
sunday
is
a
blessed
day
and
therefore
it
should
not
be
made
a
gloomy
one
it
is
the
lord
day
and
i
do
believe
that
cheerful
hearts
and
faces
are
not
unpleasant
in
his
sight
o
day
of
rest
how
beautiful
how
fair
how
welcome
to
the
weary
and
the
old
day
of
the
lord
and
truce
to
earthly
cares
day
of
the
lord
as
all
our
days
should
be
ah
why
will
man
by
his
austerities
shut
out
the
blessed
sunshine
and
the
light
and
make
of
thee
a
dungeon
of
despair
about
chapter
seven
one
memorable
night
two
months
had
elapsed
since
my
arrival
at
rivermouth
when
the
approach
of
an
important
celebration
produced
the
greatest
excitement
among
the
juvenile
population
of
the
town
there
was
very
little
hard
study
done
in
the
temple
grammar
school
the
week
preceding
the
fourth
of
july
for
my
part
my
heart
and
brain
were
so
full
of
roman
candles
rockets
squibs
and
gunpowder
in
various
seductive
forms
that
i
wonder
i
did
explode
under
grimshaw
very
nose
i
could
do
a
sum
to
save
me
i
could
tell
for
love
or
money
whether
tallahassee
was
the
capital
of
tennessee
or
of
florida
the
present
and
the
pluperfect
tenses
were
inextricably
mixed
in
my
memory
and
i
did
know
a
verb
from
an
adjective
when
i
met
one
this
was
not
alone
my
condition
but
that
of
every
boy
in
the
school
grimshaw
considerately
made
allowances
for
our
temporary
distraction
and
sought
to
fix
our
interest
on
the
lessons
by
connecting
them
directly
or
indirectly
with
the
coming
event
the
class
in
arithmetic
for
instance
was
requested
to
state
how
many
boxes
of
each
box
measuring
sixteen
inches
square
could
be
stored
in
a
room
of
such
and
such
dimensions
he
gave
us
the
declaration
of
independence
for
a
parsing
exercise
and
in
geography
confined
his
questions
almost
exclusively
to
localities
rendered
famous
in
the
revolutionary
war
what
did
the
people
of
boston
do
with
the
tea
on
board
the
english
vessels
asked
our
wily
instructor
threw
it
into
the
river
shrieked
the
smaller
boys
with
an
impetuosity
that
made
grimshaw
smile
in
spite
of
himself
one
luckless
urchin
said
chucked
it
for
which
happy
expression
he
was
kept
in
at
recess
notwithstanding
these
clever
stratagems
there
was
not
much
solid
work
done
by
anybody
the
trail
of
the
serpent
an
inexpensive
but
dangerous
was
over
us
all
we
went
round
deformed
by
quantities
of
chinese
crackers
artlessly
concealed
in
our
and
if
a
boy
whipped
out
his
handkerchief
without
proper
precaution
he
was
sure
to
let
off
two
or
three
torpedoes
even
grimshaw
was
made
a
sort
of
accessory
to
the
universal
demoralization
in
calling
the
school
to
order
he
always
rapped
on
the
table
with
a
heavy
ruler
under
the
green
baize
on
the
exact
spot
where
he
usually
struck
certain
boy
whose
name
i
withhold
placed
a
fat
torpedo
the
result
was
a
loud
explosion
which
caused
grimshaw
to
look
queer
charley
marden
was
at
the
at
the
time
and
directed
general
attention
to
himself
by
strangling
for
several
seconds
and
then
squirting
a
slender
thread
of
water
over
the
blackboard
grimshaw
fixed
his
eyes
reproachfully
on
charley
but
said
nothing
the
real
culprit
it
was
charley
marden
but
the
boy
whose
name
i
withhold
instantly
regretted
his
badness
and
after
school
confessed
the
whole
thing
to
grimshaw
who
heaped
coals
of
fire
upon
the
nameless
boy
head
giving
him
five
cents
for
the
fourth
of
july
if
grimshaw
had
caned
this
unknown
youth
the
punishment
would
not
have
been
half
so
severe
on
the
last
day
of
june
the
captain
received
a
letter
from
my
father
enclosing
five
dollars
for
my
son
tom
which
enabled
that
young
gentleman
to
make
regal
preparations
for
the
celebration
of
our
national
independence
a
portion
of
this
money
two
dollars
i
hastened
to
invest
in
fireworks
the
balance
i
put
by
for
contingencies
in
placing
the
fund
in
my
possession
the
captain
imposed
one
condition
that
dampened
my
ardor
considerably
i
was
to
buy
no
gunpowder
i
might
have
all
the
and
torpedoes
i
wanted
but
gunpowder
was
out
of
the
question
i
thought
this
rather
hard
for
all
my
young
friends
were
provided
with
pistols
of
various
sizes
pepper
whitcomb
had
a
nearly
as
large
as
himself
and
jack
harris
though
he
to
be
sure
was
a
big
boy
was
going
to
have
a
real
oldfashioned
flintlock
musket
however
i
did
mean
to
let
this
drawback
destroy
my
happiness
i
had
one
charge
of
powder
stowed
away
in
the
little
brass
pistol
which
i
brought
from
new
orleans
and
was
bound
to
make
a
noise
in
the
world
once
if
i
never
did
again
it
was
a
custom
observed
from
time
immemorial
for
the
to
have
a
bonfire
on
the
square
on
the
midnight
before
the
fourth
i
did
ask
the
captain
leave
to
attend
this
ceremony
for
i
had
a
general
idea
that
he
would
give
it
if
the
captain
i
reasoned
does
forbid
me
i
break
no
orders
by
going
now
this
was
a
specious
line
of
argument
and
the
mishaps
that
befell
me
in
consequence
of
adopting
it
were
richly
deserved
on
the
evening
of
the
i
retired
to
bed
very
early
in
order
to
disarm
suspicion
i
did
sleep
a
wink
waiting
for
eleven
to
come
round
and
i
thought
it
never
would
come
round
as
i
lay
counting
from
time
to
time
the
slow
strokes
of
the
ponderous
bell
in
the
steeple
of
the
old
north
church
at
length
the
laggard
hour
arrived
while
the
clock
was
striking
i
jumped
out
of
bed
and
began
dressing
my
grandfather
and
miss
abigail
were
heavy
sleepers
and
i
might
have
stolen
downstairs
and
out
at
the
front
door
undetected
but
such
a
commonplace
proceeding
did
not
suit
my
adventurous
disposition
i
fastened
one
end
of
a
rope
it
was
a
few
yards
cut
from
kitty
to
the
bedpost
nearest
the
window
and
cautiously
climbed
out
on
the
wide
pediment
over
the
hall
door
i
had
neglected
to
knot
the
rope
the
result
was
that
the
moment
i
swung
clear
of
the
pediment
i
descended
like
a
flash
of
lightning
and
warmed
both
my
hands
smartly
the
rope
moreover
was
four
or
five
feet
too
short
so
i
got
a
fall
that
would
have
proved
serious
had
i
not
tumbled
into
the
middle
of
one
of
the
big
growing
on
either
side
of
the
steps
i
scrambled
out
of
that
without
delay
and
was
congratulating
myself
on
my
good
luck
when
i
saw
by
the
light
of
the
setting
moon
the
form
of
a
man
leaning
over
the
garden
gate
it
was
one
of
the
town
watch
who
had
probably
been
observing
my
operations
with
curiosity
seeing
no
chance
of
escape
i
put
a
bold
face
on
the
matter
and
walked
directly
up
to
him
what
on
airth
air
you
a
doin
asked
the
man
grasping
the
collar
of
my
jacket
i
live
here
sir
if
you
please
i
replied
and
am
going
to
the
bonfire
i
did
want
to
wake
up
the
old
folks
that
the
man
cocked
his
eye
at
me
in
the
most
amiable
manner
and
released
his
hold
boys
is
boys
he
muttered
he
did
attempt
to
stop
me
as
i
slipped
through
the
gate
once
beyond
his
clutches
i
took
to
my
heels
and
soon
reached
the
square
where
i
found
forty
or
fifty
fellows
assembled
engaged
in
building
a
pyramid
of
the
palms
of
my
hands
still
tingled
so
that
i
could
join
in
the
sport
i
stood
in
the
doorway
of
the
nautilus
bank
watching
the
workers
among
whom
i
recognized
lots
of
my
schoolmates
they
looked
like
a
legion
of
imps
coming
and
going
in
the
twilight
busy
in
raising
some
infernal
edifice
what
a
babel
of
voices
it
was
everybody
directing
everybody
else
and
everybody
doing
everything
wrong
when
all
was
prepared
someone
applied
a
match
to
the
sombre
pile
a
fiery
tongue
thrust
itself
out
here
and
there
then
suddenly
the
whole
fabric
burst
into
flames
blazing
and
crackling
beautifully
this
was
a
signal
for
the
boys
to
join
hands
and
dance
around
the
burning
barrels
which
they
did
shouting
like
mad
creatures
when
the
fire
had
burnt
down
a
little
fresh
staves
were
brought
and
heaped
on
the
pyre
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
i
forgot
my
tingling
palms
and
found
myself
in
the
thick
of
the
carousal
before
we
were
half
ready
our
combustible
material
was
expended
and
a
disheartening
kind
of
darkness
settled
down
upon
us
the
boys
collected
together
here
and
there
in
knots
consulting
as
to
what
should
be
done
it
yet
lacked
four
or
five
hours
of
daybreak
and
none
of
us
were
in
the
humor
to
return
to
bed
i
approached
one
of
the
groups
standing
near
the
town
pump
and
discovered
in
the
uncertain
light
of
the
dying
brands
the
figures
of
jack
harris
phil
adams
harry
blake
and
pepper
whitcomb
their
faces
streaked
with
perspiration
and
tar
and
their
whole
appearance
suggestive
of
new
zealand
chiefs
hullo
here
tom
bailey
shouted
pepper
whitcomb
he
join
in
of
course
he
would
the
sting
had
gone
out
of
my
hands
and
i
was
ripe
for
anything
none
the
less
ripe
for
not
knowing
what
was
on
the
tapis
after
whispering
together
for
a
moment
the
boys
motioned
me
to
follow
them
we
glided
out
from
the
crowd
and
silently
wended
our
way
through
a
neighboring
alley
at
the
head
of
which
stood
a
old
barn
owned
by
one
ezra
wingate
in
former
days
this
was
the
stable
of
the
that
ran
between
rivermouth
and
boston
when
the
railroad
superseded
that
primitive
mode
of
travel
the
lumbering
vehicle
was
rolled
in
the
barn
and
there
it
stayed
the
after
prophesying
the
immediate
downfall
of
the
nation
died
of
grief
and
apoplexy
and
the
old
coach
followed
in
his
wake
as
fast
as
could
by
quietly
dropping
to
pieces
the
barn
had
the
reputation
of
being
haunted
and
i
think
we
all
kept
very
close
together
when
we
found
ourselves
standing
in
the
black
shadow
cast
by
the
tall
gable
here
in
a
low
voice
jack
harris
laid
bare
his
plan
which
was
to
burn
the
ancient
the
old
is
worth
cents
said
jack
harris
and
ezra
wingate
ought
to
thank
us
for
getting
the
rubbish
out
of
the
way
but
if
any
fellow
here
does
want
to
have
a
hand
in
it
let
him
cut
and
run
and
keep
a
quiet
tongue
in
his
head
ever
with
this
he
pulled
out
the
staples
that
held
the
lock
and
the
big
barn
door
swung
slowly
open
the
interior
of
the
stable
was
of
course
as
we
made
a
movement
to
enter
a
sudden
scrambling
and
the
sound
of
heavy
bodies
leaping
in
all
directions
caused
us
to
start
back
in
terror
rats
cried
phil
adams
bats
exclaimed
harry
blake
cats
suggested
jack
harris
who
afraid
well
the
truth
is
we
were
all
afraid
and
if
the
pole
of
the
stage
had
not
been
lying
close
to
the
threshold
i
do
believe
anything
on
earth
would
have
induced
us
to
cross
it
we
seized
hold
of
the
and
succeeded
with
great
trouble
in
dragging
the
coach
out
the
two
fore
wheels
had
rusted
to
the
and
refused
to
revolve
it
was
the
merest
skeleton
of
a
coach
the
cushions
had
long
since
been
removed
and
the
leather
hangings
where
they
had
not
crumbled
away
dangled
in
shreds
from
the
frame
a
load
of
ghosts
and
a
span
of
phantom
horses
to
drag
them
would
have
made
the
ghastly
thing
complete
luckily
for
our
undertaking
the
stable
stood
at
the
top
of
a
very
steep
hill
with
three
boys
to
push
behind
and
two
in
front
to
steer
we
started
the
old
coach
on
its
last
trip
with
little
or
no
difficulty
our
speed
increased
every
moment
and
the
fore
wheels
becoming
unlocked
as
we
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
declivity
we
charged
upon
the
crowd
like
a
regiment
of
cavalry
scattering
the
people
right
and
left
before
reaching
the
bonfire
to
which
someone
had
added
several
bushels
of
shavings
jack
harris
and
phil
adams
who
were
steering
dropped
on
the
ground
and
allowed
the
vehicle
to
pass
over
them
which
it
did
without
injuring
them
but
the
boys
who
were
clinging
for
dear
life
to
the
behind
fell
over
the
prostrate
steersman
and
there
we
all
lay
in
a
heap
two
or
three
of
us
quite
picturesque
with
the
the
coach
with
an
intuitive
perception
of
what
was
expected
of
it
plunged
into
the
centre
of
the
kindling
shavings
and
stopped
the
flames
sprung
up
and
clung
to
the
rotten
woodwork
which
burned
like
tinder
at
this
moment
a
figure
was
seen
leaping
wildly
from
the
inside
of
the
blazing
coach
the
figure
made
three
bounds
towards
us
and
tripped
over
harry
blake
it
was
pepper
whitcomb
with
his
hair
somewhat
singed
and
his
eyebrows
completely
scorched
off
pepper
had
slyly
ensconced
himself
on
the
back
seat
before
we
started
intending
to
have
a
neat
little
ride
down
hill
and
a
laugh
at
us
afterwards
but
the
laugh
as
it
happened
was
on
our
side
or
would
have
been
if
half
a
dozen
watchmen
had
not
suddenly
pounced
down
upon
us
as
we
lay
scrambling
on
the
ground
weak
with
mirth
over
misfortune
we
were
collared
and
marched
off
before
we
well
knew
what
had
happened
the
abrupt
transition
from
the
noise
and
light
of
the
square
to
the
silent
gloomy
brick
room
in
the
rear
of
the
meat
market
seemed
like
the
work
of
enchantment
we
stared
at
each
other
aghast
well
remarked
jack
harris
with
a
sickly
smile
this
is
a
go
no
go
i
should
say
whimpered
harry
blake
glancing
at
the
bare
brick
walls
and
the
heavy
ironplated
door
never
say
die
muttered
phil
adams
dolefully
the
bridewell
was
a
small
chamber
built
up
against
the
rear
end
of
the
meat
market
and
approached
from
the
square
by
a
narrow
a
portion
of
the
rooms
partitioned
off
into
eight
cells
numbered
each
capable
of
holding
two
persons
the
cells
were
full
at
the
time
as
we
presently
discovered
by
seeing
several
hideous
faces
leering
out
at
us
through
the
gratings
of
the
doors
a
smoky
in
a
lantern
suspended
from
the
ceiling
threw
a
flickering
light
over
the
apartment
which
contained
no
furniture
excepting
a
couple
of
stout
wooden
benches
it
was
a
dismal
place
by
night
and
only
little
less
dismal
by
day
tall
houses
surrounding
the
prevented
the
faintest
ray
of
sunshine
from
penetrating
the
ventilator
over
the
door
long
narrow
window
opening
inward
and
propped
up
by
a
piece
of
lath
as
we
seated
ourselves
in
a
row
on
one
of
the
benches
i
imagine
that
our
aspect
was
anything
but
cheerful
adams
and
harris
looked
very
anxious
and
harry
blake
whose
nose
had
just
stopped
bleeding
was
mournfully
carving
his
name
by
sheer
force
of
habit
on
the
prison
bench
i
do
think
i
ever
saw
a
more
wrecked
expression
on
any
human
countenance
than
pepper
whitcomb
presented
his
look
of
natural
astonishment
at
finding
himself
incarcerated
in
a
jail
was
considerably
heightened
by
his
lack
of
eyebrows
as
for
me
it
was
only
by
thinking
how
the
late
baron
trenck
would
have
conducted
himself
under
similar
circumstances
that
i
was
able
to
restrain
my
tears
none
of
us
were
inclined
to
conversation
a
deep
silence
broken
now
and
then
by
a
startling
snore
from
the
cells
reigned
throughout
the
chamber
by
and
by
pepper
whitcomb
glanced
nervously
towards
phil
adams
and
said
phil
do
you
think
they
will
hang
us
hang
your
grandmother
returned
adams
impatiently
what
i
afraid
of
is
that
they
keep
us
locked
up
until
the
fourth
is
you
ai
smart
ef
they
do
cried
a
voice
from
one
of
the
cells
it
was
a
deep
bass
voice
that
sent
a
chill
through
me
who
are
you
said
jack
harris
addressing
the
cells
in
general
for
the
echoing
qualities
of
the
room
made
it
difficult
to
locate
the
voice
that
do
matter
replied
the
speaker
putting
his
face
close
up
to
the
gratings
of
no
but
ef
i
was
a
youngster
like
you
free
an
easy
outside
there
this
spot
would
hold
me
that
so
chimed
several
of
the
wagging
their
heads
behind
the
iron
lattices
hush
whispered
jack
harris
rising
from
his
seat
and
walking
on
to
the
door
of
cell
no
what
would
you
do
do
why
i
pile
them
benches
up
agin
that
door
an
crawl
out
of
that
winder
in
no
time
that
my
and
werry
good
adwice
it
is
jim
said
the
occupant
of
no
approvingly
jack
harris
seemed
to
be
of
the
same
opinion
for
he
hastily
placed
the
benches
one
on
the
top
of
another
under
the
ventilator
and
climbing
up
on
the
highest
bench
peeped
out
into
the
if
any
gent
happens
to
have
a
ninepence
about
him
said
the
man
in
cell
no
there
a
sufferin
family
here
as
could
make
use
of
it
smallest
favors
gratefully
received
an
no
questions
this
appeal
touched
a
new
silver
quarter
of
a
dollar
in
my
i
fished
out
the
coin
from
a
mass
of
fireworks
and
gave
it
to
the
prisoner
he
appeared
to
be
so
a
fellow
that
i
ventured
to
ask
what
he
had
done
to
get
into
jail
intirely
innocent
i
was
clapped
in
here
by
a
rascally
nevew
as

to

my
wealth

i
inquired
with
a
view
of
reporting
the
outrage
to
my
grandfather
and
having
the
injured
person
re
instated
in
society
git
out
you
insolent
young
reptyle
shouted
the
man
in
a
passion
i
retreated
precipitately
amid
a
roar
of
laughter
from
the
other
cells
ca
you
keep
still
exclaimed
harris
withdrawing
his
head
from
the
window
a
portly
watchman
usually
sat
on
a
stool
outside
the
door
day
and
night
but
on
this
particular
occasion
his
services
being
required
elsewhere
the
bridewell
had
been
left
to
guard
itself
all
clear
whispered
jack
harris
as
he
vanished
through
the
aperture
and
dropped
softly
on
the
ground
outside
we
all
followed
him
expeditiously
pepper
whitcomb
and
myself
getting
stuck
in
the
window
for
a
moment
in
our
frantic
efforts
not
to

chapter

the
adventures
of
a
fourth
the
sun
cast
a
broad
column
of
quivering
gold
across
the
river
at
the
foot
of
our
street
just
as
i
reached
the
doorstep
of
the
nutter
house
kitty
collins
with
her
dress
tucked
about
her
so
that
she
looked
as
if
she
had
on
a
pair
of
calico
trousers
was
washing
off
the
sidewalk
arrah
you
bad
boy
cried
kitty
leaning
on
the
mop

the
capen
has
jist
been
askin
for

now
it
a
nate
thing

and
it
me
you
may
thank
for
gettin
it
out
of
the
way
before
the
capen
come
the
kind
creature
had
hauled
in
the
rope
and
my
escapade
had
not
been
discovered
by
the
family
but
i
knew
very
well
that
the
burning
of
the
and
the
arrest
of
the
boys
concerned
in
the
mischief
were
sure
to
reach
my
grandfathers
ears
sooner
or
later
well
thomas
said
the
old
gentleman
an
hour
or
so
afterwards
beaming
upon
me
benevolently
across
the
breakfast
table
you
wait
to
be
called
this
no
sir
i
replied
growing
very
warm
i
took
a
little
run
up
town
to
see
what
was
going
i
did
say
anything
about
the
little
run
i
took
home
again
they
had
quite
a
time
on
the
square
last
night
remarked
captain
nutter
looking
up
from
the
rivermouth
barnacle
which
was
always
placed
beside
his
at
breakfast
i
felt
that
my
hair
was
preparing
to
stand
on
end
quite
a
time
continued
my
grandfather
some
boys
broke
into
ezra
wingate
barn
and
carried
off
the
old
stagecoach
the
young
rascals
i
do
believe
they
burn
up
the
whole
town
if
they
had
their
with
this
he
resumed
the
paper
after
a
long
silence
he
exclaimed
hullo
upon
which
i
nearly
fell
off
the
chair
unknown
read
my
grandfather
following
the
paragraph
with
his
forefinger
from
the
bridewell
leaving
no
clew
to
their
identity
except
the
letter
h
cut
on
one
of
the
benches
dollars
reward
offered
for
the
apprehension
of
the
perpetrators
sho
i
hope
wingate
will
catch
i
do
see
how
i
continued
to
live
for
on
hearing
this
the
breath
went
entirely
out
of
my
body
i
beat
a
retreat
from
the
room
as
soon
as
i
could
and
flew
to
the
stable
with
a
misty
intention
of
mounting
gypsy
and
escaping
from
the
place
i
was
pondering
what
steps
to
take
when
jack
harris
and
charley
marden
entered
the
yard
i
say
said
harris
as
blithe
as
a
lark
has
old
wingate
been
here
been
here
i
cried
i
should
hope
not
the
whole
thing
out
you
know
said
harris
pulling
gypsy
forelock
over
her
eyes
and
blowing
playfully
into
her
nostrils
you
do
mean
it
i
gasped
yes
i
do
and
we
are
to
pay
wingate
three
dollars
apiece
he
make
rather
a
good
spec
out
of
but
how
did
he
discover
that
we
were
the
the
miscreants
i
asked
quoting
mechanically
from
the
rivermouth
bamacle
why
he
saw
us
take
the
old
ark
confound
him
he
been
trying
to
sell
it
any
time
these
ten
years
now
he
has
sold
it
to
us
when
he
found
that
we
had
slipped
out
of
the
meat
market
he
went
right
off
and
wrote
the
advertisement
offering
five
dollars
reward
though
he
knew
well
enough
who
had
taken
the
coach
for
he
came
round
to
my
house
before
the
paper
was
printed
to
talk
the
matter
over
was
the
governor
mad
though
but
it
all
settled
i
tell
you
we
to
pay
wingate
fifteen
dollars
for
the
old
which
he
wanted
to
sell
the
other
day
for
cents
and
could
it
a
downright
swindle
but
the
funny
part
of
it
is
to
o
there
a
funny
part
to
it
is
there
i
remarked
bitterly
yes
the
moment
bill
conway
saw
the
advertisement
he
knew
it
was
harry
blake
who
cut
that
letter
h
on
the
bench
so
off
he
rushes
up
to
wingate
kind
of
him
was
it
and
claims
the
reward
late
young
man
says
old
wingate
culprits
has
been
discovered
you
see
had
any
intention
of
paying
that
five
jack
harris
statement
lifted
a
weight
from
my
bosom
the
article
in
the
rivermouth
barnacle
had
placed
the
affair
before
me
in
a
new
light
i
had
thoughtlessly
committed
a
grave
offence
though
the
property
in
question
was
valueless
we
were
clearly
wrong
in
destroying
it
at
the
same
time
wingate
had
tacitly
sanctioned
the
act
by
not
preventing
it
when
he
might
easily
have
done
so
he
had
allowed
his
property
to
be
destroyed
in
order
that
he
might
realize
a
large
profit
without
waiting
to
hear
more
i
went
straight
to
captain
nutter
and
laying
my
remaining
three
dollars
on
his
knee
confessed
my
share
in
the
previous
night
transaction
the
captain
heard
me
through
in
profound
silence
pocketed
the
and
walked
off
without
speaking
a
word
he
had
punished
me
in
his
own
whimsical
fashion
at
the
breakfast
table
for
at
the
very
moment
he
was
harrowing
up
my
soul
by
reading
the
extracts
from
the
rivermouth
barnacle
he
not
only
knew
all
about
the
bonfire
but
had
paid
ezra
wingate
his
three
dollars
such
was
the
duplicity
of
that
aged
impostor
i
think
captain
nutter
was
justified
in
retaining
my
pocketmoney
as
additional
punishment
though
the
possession
of
it
later
in
the
day
would
have
got
me
out
of
a
difficult
position
as
the
reader
will
see
further
on
i
returned
with
a
light
heart
and
a
large
piece
of
punk
to
my
friends
in
the
where
we
celebrated
the
termination
of
our
trouble
by
setting
off
two
packs
of
in
an
empty
they
made
a
prodigious
racket
but
failed
somehow
to
fully
express
my
feelings
the
little
brass
pistol
in
my
bedroom
suddenly
occurred
to
me
it
had
been
loaded
i
do
know
how
many
months
long
before
i
left
new
orleans
and
now
was
the
time
if
ever
to
fire
it
off
muskets
blunderbusses
and
pistols
were
banging
away
lively
all
over
town
and
the
smell
of
gunpowder
floating
on
the
air
set
me
wild
to
add
something
respectable
to
the
universal
din
when
the
pistol
was
produced
jack
harris
examined
the
rusty
cap
and
prophesied
that
it
would
not
explode
never
mind
said
i
let
try
i
had
fired
the
pistol
once
secretly
in
new
orleans
and
remembering
the
noise
it
gave
birth
to
on
that
occasion
i
shut
both
eyes
tight
as
i
pulled
the
trigger
the
hammer
clicked
on
the
cap
with
a
dull
dead
sound
then
harris
tried
it
then
charley
marden
then
i
took
it
again
and
after
three
or
four
trials
was
on
the
point
of
giving
it
up
as
a
bad
job
when
the
obstinate
thing
went
off
with
a
tremendous
explosion
nearly
jerking
my
arm
from
the
socket
the
smoke
cleared
away
and
there
i
stood
with
the
stock
of
the
pistol
clutched
convulsively
in
my
hand
the
barrel
lock
trigger
and
ramrod
having
vanished
into
thin
air
are
you
hurt
cried
the
boys
in
one
breath
n
no
i
replied
dubiously
for
the
concussion
had
bewildered
me
a
little
when
i
realized
the
nature
of
the
calamity
my
grief
was
excessive
i
ca
imagine
what
led
me
to
do
so
ridiculous
a
thing
but
i
gravely
buried
the
remains
of
my
beloved
pistol
in
our
back
garden
and
erected
over
the
mound
a
slate
tablet
to
the
effect
that
mr
barker
formerly
of
new
orleans
was
killed
accidentally
on
the
fourth
of
july
in
the
year
of
his
binny
wallace
arriving
on
the
spot
just
after
the
disaster
and
charley
marden
who
enjoyed
the
obsequies
immensely
acted
with
me
as
chief
mourners
i
for
my
part
was
a
very
sincere
one
as
i
turned
away
in
a
disconsolate
mood
from
the
garden
charley
marden
remarked
that
he
should
be
surprised
if
the
took
root
and
grew
into
a
or
something
he
said
he
once
planted
an
old
and
shortly
afterwards
a
lot
of
shoots
sprung
up
jack
harris
laughed
but
neither
i
nor
binny
wallace
saw
charley
wicked
joke
we
were
now
joined
by
pepper
whitcomb
fred
langdon
and
several
other
desperate
characters
on
their
way
to
the
square
which
was
always
a
busy
place
when
public
festivities
were
going
on
feeling
that
i
was
still
in
disgrace
with
the
captain
i
thought
it
politic
to
ask
his
consent
before
accompanying
the
boys
he
gave
it
with
some
hesitation
advising
me
to
be
careful
not
to
get
in
front
of
the
firearms
once
he
put
his
fingers
mechanically
into
his
and
half
drew
forth
some
dollar
bills
then
slowly
thrust
them
back
again
as
his
sense
of
justice
overcame
his
genial
disposition
i
guess
it
cut
the
old
gentleman
to
the
heart
to
be
obliged
to
keep
me
out
of
my
i
know
it
did
me
however
as
i
was
passing
through
the
hall
miss
abigail
with
a
very
severe
cast
of
countenance
slipped
a
quarter
into
my
hand
we
had
silver
currency
in
those
days
thank
heaven
great
were
the
bustle
and
confusion
on
the
square
by
the
way
i
know
why
they
called
this
large
open
space
a
square
unless
because
it
was
an
oval
an
oval
formed
by
the
confluence
of
half
a
dozen
streets
now
thronged
by
crowds
of
smartly
dressed
and
country
folks
for
rivermouth
on
the
fourth
was
the
centre
of
attraction
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
neighboring
villages
on
one
side
of
the
square
were
twenty
or
thirty
booths
arranged
in
a
gay
with
little
flags
and
seductive
with
lemonade
and
seedcakes
here
and
there
were
tables
at
which
could
be
purchased
the
smaller
sort
of
fireworks
such
as
serpents
and
punk
warranted
not
to
go
out
many
of
the
adjacent
houses
made
a
pretty
display
of
bunting
and
across
each
of
the
streets
opening
on
the
square
was
an
arch
of
spruce
and
evergreen
blossoming
all
over
with
patriotic
mottoes
and
paper
roses
it
was
a
noisy
merry
bewildering
scene
as
we
came
upon
the
ground
the
incessant
rattle
of
small
arms
the
booming
of
the
firing
on
the
mill
dam
and
the
silvery
clangor
of
the
ringing
simultaneously
not
to
mention
an
ambitious
that
was
blowing
itself
to
pieces
on
a
balcony
were
enough
to
drive
one
distracted
we
amused
ourselves
for
an
hour
or
two
darting
in
and
out
among
the
crowd
and
setting
off
our
crackers
at
one
the
hon
hezekiah
elkins
mounted
a
platform
in
the
middle
of
the
square
and
delivered
an
oration
to
which
his
did
pay
much
attention
having
all
they
could
do
to
dodge
the
squibs
that
were
set
loose
upon
them
by
mischievous
boys
stationed
on
the
surrounding
housetops
our
little
party
which
had
picked
up
recruits
here
and
there
not
being
swayed
by
eloquence
withdrew
to
a
booth
on
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
where
we
regaled
ourselves
with
root
beer
at
two
cents
a
glass
i
recollect
being
much
struck
by
the
placard
surmounting
this
tent
root
beer
sold
here
it
seemed
to
me
the
perfection
of
pith
and
poetry
what
could
be
more
terse
not
a
word
to
spare
and
yet
everything
fully
expressed
rhyme
and
rhythm
faultless
it
was
a
delightful
poet
who
made
those
verses
as
for
the
beer
itself
that
i
think
must
have
been
made
from
the
root
of
all
evil
a
single
glass
of
it
insured
an
uninterrupted
pain
for
hours
the
influence
of
my
liberality
working
on
charley
marden
for
it
was
i
who
paid
for
the
beer
he
presently
invited
us
all
to
take
an
with
him
at
pettingil
saloon
pettingil
was
the
delmonico
of
rivermouth
he
furnished
ices
and
confectionery
for
aristocratic
balls
and
parties
and
did
disdain
to
officiate
as
leader
of
the
orchestra
at
the
same
for
pettingil
played
on
the
violin
as
pepper
whitcomb
described
it
like
old
pettingil
confectionery
store
was
on
the
corner
of
willow
and
high
streets
the
saloon
separated
from
the
shop
by
a
flight
of
three
steps
leading
to
a
door
hung
with
faded
red
drapery
had
about
it
an
air
of
mystery
and
seclusion
quite
delightful
four
windows
also
draped
faced
the
affording
an
unobstructed
view
of
marm
hatch
back
yard
where
a
number
of
inexplicable
garments
on
a
were
always
to
be
seen
careering
in
the
wind
there
was
a
lull
just
then
in
the
business
it
being
and
we
found
the
saloon
unoccupied
when
we
had
seated
ourselves
around
the
largest
table
charley
marden
in
a
manly
voice
ordered
twelve
sixpenny
icecreams
strawberry
and
verneller
it
was
a
magnificent
sight
those
twelve
chilly
glasses
entering
the
room
on
a
waiter
the
red
and
white
custard
rising
from
each
glass
like
a
and
the
shooting
up
from
the
apex
like
a
spire
i
doubt
if
a
person
of
the
nicest
palate
could
have
distinguished
with
his
eyes
shut
which
was
the
vanilla
and
which
the
strawberry
but
if
i
could
at
this
moment
obtain
a
cream
tasting
as
that
did
i
would
give
five
dollars
for
a
very
small
quantity
we
fell
to
with
a
will
and
so
evenly
balanced
were
our
capabilities
that
we
finished
our
creams
together
the
spoons
clinking
in
the
glasses
like
one
spoon
let
have
some
more
cried
charley
marden
with
the
air
of
aladdin
ordering
up
a
fresh
hogshead
of
pearls
and
rubies
tom
bailey
tell
pettingil
to
send
in
another
could
i
credit
my
ears
i
looked
at
him
to
see
if
he
were
in
earnest
he
meant
it
in
a
moment
more
i
was
leaning
over
the
counter
giving
directions
for
a
second
supply
thinking
it
would
make
no
difference
to
such
a
gorgeous
young
sybarite
as
marden
i
took
the
liberty
of
ordering
ninepenny
creams
this
time
on
returning
to
the
saloon
what
was
my
horror
at
finding
it
empty
there
were
the
twelve
cloudy
glasses
standing
in
a
circle
on
the
sticky
marble
slab
and
not
a
boy
to
be
seen
a
pair
of
hands
letting
go
their
hold
on
the
outside
explained
matters
i
had
been
made
a
victim
i
could
stay
and
face
pettingil
whose
peppery
temper
was
well
known
among
the
boys
i
had
a
cent
in
the
world
to
appease
him
what
should
i
do
i
heard
the
clink
of
approaching
glasses
the
ninepenny
creams
i
rushed
to
the
nearest
window
it
was
only
five
feet
to
the
ground
i
threw
myself
out
as
if
i
had
been
an
old
hat
landing
on
my
feet
i
fled
breathlessly
down
high
street
through
willow
and
was
turning
into
brierwood
place
when
the
sound
of
several
voices
calling
to
me
in
distress
stopped
my
progress
look
out
you
fool
the
mine
the
mine
yelled
the
warning
voices
several
men
and
boys
were
standing
at
the
head
of
the
street
making
insane
gestures
to
me
to
avoid
something
but
i
saw
no
mine
only
in
the
middle
of
the
road
in
front
of
me
was
a
common
which
as
i
gazed
at
it
suddenly
rose
into
the
air
with
a
terrific
explosion
i
felt
myself
thrown
violently
off
my
feet
i
remember
nothing
else
excepting
that
as
i
went
up
i
caught
a
momentary
glimpse
of
ezra
wingate
leering
through
is
shop
window
like
an
avenging
spirit
the
mine
that
had
wrought
me
woe
was
not
properly
a
mine
at
all
but
merely
a
few
ounces
of
powder
placed
under
an
empty
keg
or
barrel
and
fired
with
a
boys
who
did
happen
to
have
pistols
or
cannon
generally
burnt
their
powder
in
this
fashion
for
an
account
of
what
followed
i
am
indebted
to
hearsay
for
i
was
insensible
when
the
people
picked
me
up
and
carried
me
home
on
a
shutter
borrowed
from
the
proprietor
of
pettingil
saloon
i
was
supposed
to
be
killed
but
happily
happily
for
me
at
least
i
was
merely
stunned
i
lay
in
a
state
until
eight
that
night
when
i
attempted
to
speak
miss
abigail
who
watched
by
the
bedside
put
her
ear
down
to
my
lips
and
was
saluted
with
these
remarkable
words
strawberry
and
verneller
mixed
mercy
on
us
what
is

piece

preserved
in
the

which
was
subsequently
dug
up
for
a
postmortem
examination
chapter
nine
i
become
an
in
the
course
of
ten
days
i
recovered
sufficiently
from
my
injuries
to
attend
school
where
for
a
little
while
i
was
looked
upon
as
a
hero
on
account
of
having
been
blown
up
what
do
we
make
a
hero
of
the
distraction
which
prevailed
in
the
classes
the
week
preceding
the
fourth
had
subsided
and
nothing
remained
to
indicate
the
recent
festivities
excepting
a
noticeable
want
of
eyebrows
on
the
part
of
pepper
whitcomb
and
myself
in
august
we
had
two
weeks
vacation
it
was
about
this
time
that
i
became
a
member
of
the
rivermouth
centipedes
a
secret
society
composed
of
twelve
of
the
temple
grammar
school
boys
this
was
an
honor
to
which
i
had
long
aspired
but
being
a
new
boy
i
was
not
admitted
to
the
fraternity
until
my
character
had
fully
developed
itself
it
was
a
very
select
society
the
object
of
which
i
never
fathomed
though
i
was
an
active
member
of
the
body
during
the
remainder
of
my
residence
at
rivermouth
and
at
one
time
held
the
onerous
position
of
first
centipede
each
of
the
elect
wore
a
copper
cent
some
occult
association
being
established
between
a
cent
apiece
and
a
centipedes
suspended
by
a
string
round
his
neck
the
medals
were
worn
next
the
skin
and
it
was
while
bathing
one
day
at
grave
point
with
jack
harris
and
fred
langdon
that
i
had
my
curiosity
roused
to
the
highest
pitch
by
a
sight
of
these
singular
emblems
as
soon
as
i
ascertained
the
existence
of
a
boys
club
of
course
i
was
ready
to
die
to
join
it
and
eventually
i
was
allowed
to
join
the
initiation
ceremony
took
place
in
fred
langdon
barn
where
i
was
submitted
to
a
series
of
trials
not
calculated
to
soothe
the
nerves
of
a
timorous
boy
before
being
led
to
the
grotto
of
enchantment
such
was
the
modest
title
given
to
the
loft
over
my
friend
my
hands
were
securely
pinioned
and
my
eyes
covered
with
a
thick
silk
handkerchief
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
i
was
told
in
an
unrecognizable
husky
voice
that
it
was
not
yet
too
late
to
retreat
if
i
felt
myself
physically
too
weak
to
undergo
the
necessary
tortures
i
replied
that
i
was
not
too
weak
in
a
tone
which
i
intended
to
be
resolute
but
which
in
spite
of
me
seemed
to
come
from
the
pit
of
my
stomach
it
is
well
said
the
husky
voice
i
did
not
feel
so
sure
about
that
but
having
made
up
my
mind
to
be
a
centipede
a
centipede
i
was
bound
to
be
other
boys
had
passed
through
the
ordeal
and
lived
why
should
not
i
a
prolonged
silence
followed
this
preliminary
examination
and
i
was
wondering
what
would
come
next
when
a
pistol
fired
off
close
by
my
car
deafened
me
for
a
moment
the
unknown
voice
then
directed
me
to
take
ten
steps
forward
and
stop
at
the
word
halt
i
took
ten
steps
and
halted
stricken
mortal
said
a
second
husky
voice
more
husky
if
possible
than
the
first
if
you
had
advanced
another
inch
you
would
have
disappeared
down
an
abyss
three
thousand
feet
deep
i
naturally
shrunk
back
at
this
friendly
piece
of
information
a
prick
from
some
instrument
evidently
a
pitchfork
gently
checked
my
retreat
i
was
then
conducted
to
the
brink
of
several
other
precipices
and
ordered
to
step
over
many
dangerous
chasms
where
the
result
would
have
been
instant
death
if
i
had
committed
the
least
mistake
i
have
neglected
to
say
that
my
movements
were
accompanied
by
dismal
groans
from
different
parts
of
the
grotto
finally
i
was
led
up
a
steep
plank
to
what
appeared
to
me
an
incalculable
height
here
i
stood
breathless
while
the
bylaws
were
read
aloud
a
more
extraordinary
code
of
laws
never
came
from
the
brain
of
man
the
penalties
attached
to
the
abject
being
who
should
reveal
any
of
the
secrets
of
the
society
were
enough
to
make
the
blood
run
cold
a
second
was
heard
the
something
i
stood
on
sunk
with
a
crash
beneath
my
feet
and
i
fell
two
miles
as
nearly
as
i
could
compute
it
at
the
same
instant
the
handkerchief
was
whisked
from
my
eyes
and
i
found
myself
standing
in
an
empty
hogshead
surrounded
by
twelve
masked
figures
fantastically
dressed
one
of
the
conspirators
was
really
appalling
with
a
tin
on
his
head
and
a
thrown
over
his
shoulders
i
scarcely
need
say
that
there
were
no
vestiges
to
be
seen
of
the
fearful
gulfs
over
which
i
had
passed
so
cautiously
my
ascent
had
been
to
the
top
of
the
hogshead
and
my
descent
to
the
bottom
thereof
holding
one
another
by
the
hand
and
chanting
a
low
dirge
the
mystic
twelve
revolved
about
me
this
concluded
the
ceremony
with
a
merry
shout
the
boys
threw
off
their
masks
and
i
was
declared
a
regularly
installed
member
of
the
i
afterwards
had
a
good
deal
of
sport
out
of
the
club
for
these
initiations
as
you
may
imagine
were
sometimes
very
comical
spectacles
especially
when
the
aspirant
for
centipedal
honors
happened
to
be
of
a
timid
disposition
if
he
showed
the
slightest
terror
he
was
certain
to
be
tricked
unmercifully
one
of
our
subsequent
devices
a
humble
invention
of
my
own
was
to
request
the
blindfolded
candidate
to
put
out
his
tongue
whereupon
the
first
centipede
would
say
in
a
low
tone
as
if
not
intended
for
the
ear
of
the
victim
diabolus
fetch
me
the
iron
the
expedition
with
which
that
tongue
would
disappear
was
simply
ridiculous
our
meetings
were
held
in
various
barns
at
no
stated
periods
but
as
circumstances
suggested
any
member
had
a
right
to
call
a
meeting
each
boy
who
failed
to
report
himself
was
fined
one
cent
whenever
a
member
had
reasons
for
thinking
that
another
member
would
be
unable
to
attend
he
called
a
meeting
for
instance
immediately
on
learning
the
death
of
harry
blake
i
issued
a
call
by
these
simple
and
ingenious
measures
we
kept
our
treasury
in
a
flourishing
condition
sometimes
having
on
hand
as
much
as
a
dollar
and
a
quarter
i
have
said
that
the
society
had
no
special
object
it
is
true
there
was
a
tacit
understanding
among
us
that
the
centipedes
were
to
stand
by
one
another
on
all
occasions
though
i
do
remember
that
they
did
but
further
than
this
we
had
no
purpose
unless
it
was
to
accomplish
as
a
body
the
same
amount
of
mischief
which
we
were
sure
to
do
as
individuals
to
mystify
the
staid
and
rivermouthians
was
our
frequent
pleasure
several
of
our
pranks
won
us
such
a
reputation
among
the
townsfolk
that
we
were
credited
with
having
a
large
finger
in
whatever
went
amiss
in
the
place
one
morning
about
a
week
after
my
admission
into
the
secret
order
the
quiet
citizens
awoke
to
find
that
the
signboards
of
all
the
principal
streets
had
changed
places
during
the
night
people
who
went
trustfully
to
sleep
in
currant
square
opened
their
eyes
in
honeysuckle
terrace
jones
avenue
at
the
north
end
had
suddenly
become
walnut
street
and
peanut
street
was
nowhere
to
be
found
confusion
reigned
the
town
authorities
took
the
matter
in
hand
without
delay
and
six
of
the
temple
grammar
school
boys
were
summoned
to
appear
before
justice
clapbam
having
tearfully
disclaimed
to
my
grandfather
all
knowledge
of
the
transaction
i
disappeared
from
the
family
circle
and
was
not
apprehended
until
late
in
the
afternoon
when
the
captain
dragged
me
ignominiously
from
the
haymow
and
conducted
me
more
dead
than
alive
to
the
office
of
justice
clapham
here
i
encountered
five
other
pallid
culprits
who
had
been
fished
out
of
divers
garrets
and
to
answer
the
demands
of
the
outraged
laws
charley
marden
had
hidden
himself
in
a
pile
of
gravel
behind
his
father
house
and
looked
like
a
recently
exhumed
mummy
there
was
not
the
least
evidence
against
us
and
indeed
we
were
wholly
innocent
of
the
offence
the
trick
as
was
afterwards
proved
had
been
played
by
a
party
of
soldiers
stationed
at
the
fort
in
the
harbor
we
were
indebted
for
our
arrest
to
master
conway
who
had
slyly
dropped
a
hint
within
the
hearing
of
selectman
mudge
to
the
effect
that
young
bailey
and
his
five
cronies
could
tell
something
about
them
when
he
was
called
upon
to
make
good
his
assertion
he
was
considerably
more
terrified
than
the
centipedes
though
they
were
ready
to
sink
into
their
shoes
at
our
next
meeting
it
was
unanimously
resolved
that
conway
animosity
should
not
be
quietly
submitted
to
he
had
sought
to
inform
against
us
in
the
stagecoach
business
he
had
volunteered
to
carry
little
bill
for
icecreams
to
charley
marden
father
and
now
he
had
caused
us
to
be
arraigned
before
justice
clapham
on
a
charge
equally
groundless
and
painful
after
much
noisy
discussion
a
plan
of
retaliation
was
agreed
upon
there
was
a
certain
slim
mild
apothecary
in
the
town
by
the
name
of
meeks
it
was
generally
given
out
that
meeks
had
a
vague
desire
to
get
married
but
being
a
shy
and
timorous
youth
lacked
the
moral
courage
to
do
so
it
was
also
well
known
that
the
widow
conway
had
not
buried
her
heart
with
the
late
lamented
as
to
her
shyness
that
was
not
so
clear
indeed
her
attentions
to
meeks
whose
mother
she
might
have
been
were
of
a
nature
not
to
be
misunderstood
and
were
not
misunderstood
by
anyone
but
meeks
himself
the
widow
carried
on
a
establishment
at
her
residence
on
the
corner
opposite
meeks
and
kept
a
wary
eye
on
all
the
young
ladies
from
miss
dorothy
gibbs
female
institute
who
patronized
the
shop
for
and
in
the
afternoon
the
widow
was
usually
seen
seated
smartly
dressed
at
her
window
upstairs
casting
destructive
glances
across
the
street
the
artificial
roses
in
her
cap
and
her
whole
languishing
manner
saying
as
plainly
as
a
label
on
a
prescription
to
be
taken
immediately
but
meeks
take
the
lady
fondness
and
the
gentleman
blindness
were
topics
ably
handled
at
every
in
the
town
it
was
through
these
two
luckless
individuals
that
we
proposed
to
strike
a
blow
at
the
common
enemy
to
kill
less
than
three
birds
with
one
stone
did
not
suit
our
sanguinary
purpose
we
disliked
the
widow
not
so
much
for
her
sentimentality
as
for
being
the
mother
of
bill
conway
we
disliked
meeks
not
because
he
was
insipid
like
his
own
syrups
but
because
the
widow
loved
him
bill
conway
we
hated
for
himself
late
one
dark
saturday
night
in
september
we
carried
our
plan
into
effect
on
the
following
morning
as
the
orderly
citizens
wended
their
way
to
church
past
the
widow
abode
their
sober
faces
relaxed
at
beholding
over
her
front
door
the
well
known
gilt
mortar
and
pestle
which
usually
stood
on
the
top
of
a
pole
on
the
opposite
corner
while
the
passers
on
that
side
of
the
street
were
equally
amused
and
scandalized
at
seeing
a
placard
bearing
the
following
announcement
tacked
to
the
druggist
wanted
a
sempstress
the
naughty
cleverness
of
the
joke
which
i
should
be
sorry
to
defend
was
recognized
at
once
it
spread
like
wildfire
over
the
town
and
though
the
mortar
and
the
placard
were
speedily
removed
our
triumph
was
complete
the
whole
community
was
on
the
broad
grin
and
our
participation
in
the
affair
seemingly
unsuspected
it
was
those
wicked
soldiers
at
the
fort
chapter
ten
i
fight
conway
there
was
one
person
however
who
cherished
a
strong
suspicion
that
the
centipedes
had
had
a
hand
in
the
business
and
that
person
was
conway
his
red
hair
seemed
to
change
to
a
livelier
red
and
his
sallow
cheeks
to
a
deeper
sallow
as
we
glanced
at
him
stealthily
over
the
tops
of
our
slates
the
next
day
in
school
he
knew
we
were
watching
him
and
made
sundry
mouths
and
scowled
in
the
most
threatening
way
over
his
sums
conway
had
an
accomplishment
peculiarly
his
own
that
of
throwing
his
thumbs
out
of
joint
at
will
sometimes
while
absorbed
in
study
or
on
becoming
nervous
at
recitation
he
performed
the
feat
unconsciously
throughout
this
entire
morning
his
thumbs
were
observed
to
be
in
a
chronic
state
of
dislocation
indicating
great
mental
agitation
on
the
part
of
the
owner
we
fully
expected
an
outbreak
from
him
at
recess
but
the
intermission
passed
off
tranquilly
somewhat
to
our
disappointment
at
the
close
of
the
afternoon
session
it
happened
that
binny
wallace
and
myself
having
got
swamped
in
our
latin
exercise
were
detained
in
school
for
the
purpose
of
refreshing
our
memories
with
a
page
of
andrews
perplexing
irregular
verbs
binny
wallace
finishing
his
task
first
was
dismissed
i
followed
shortly
after
and
on
stepping
into
the
playground
saw
my
little
friend
plastered
as
it
were
up
against
the
fence
and
conway
standing
in
front
of
him
ready
to
deliver
a
blow
on
the
upturned
unprotected
face
whose
gentleness
would
have
stayed
any
arm
but
a
coward
seth
rodgers
with
both
hands
in
his
pockets
was
leaning
against
the
pump
lazily
enjoying
the
sport
but
on
seeing
me
sweep
across
the
yard
whirling
my
strap
of
books
in
the
air
like
a
sling
he
called
out
lustily
lay
low
conway
here
young
bailey
conway
turned
just
in
time
to
catch
on
his
shoulder
the
blow
intended
for
his
head
he
reached
forward
one
of
his
long
arms
he
had
arms
like
a
windmill
that
boy
and
grasping
me
by
the
hair
tore
out
quite
a
respectable
handful
the
tears
flew
to
my
eyes
but
they
were
not
the
tears
of
defeat
they
were
merely
the
involuntary
tribute
which
nature
paid
to
the
departed
tresses
in
a
second
my
little
jacket
lay
on
the
ground
and
i
stood
on
guard
resting
lightly
on
my
right
leg
and
keeping
my
eye
fixed
steadily
on
conway
in
all
of
which
i
was
faithfully
following
the
instructions
of
phil
adams
whose
father
subscribed
to
a
sporting
journal
conway
also
threw
himself
into
a
defensive
attitude
and
there
we
were
glaring
at
each
other
motionless
neither
of
us
disposed
to
risk
an
attack
but
both
on
the
alert
to
resist
one
there
is
no
telling
how
long
we
might
have
remained
in
that
absurd
position
had
we
not
been
interrupted
it
was
a
custom
with
the
larger
pupils
to
return
to
the
playground
after
school
and
play
baseball
until
sundown
the
town
authorities
had
prohibited
on
the
square
and
there
being
no
other
available
place
the
boys
fell
back
perforce
on
the
just
at
this
crisis
a
dozen
or
so
of
the
templars
entered
the
gate
and
seeing
at
a
glance
the
belligerent
status
of
conway
and
myself
dropped
bat
and
ball
and
rushed
to
the
spot
where
we
stood
is
it
a
fight
asked
phil
adams
who
saw
by
our
freshness
that
we
had
not
yet
got
to
work
yes
it
a
fight
i
answered
unless
conway
will
ask
pardon
promise
never
to
hector
me
in
future
and
put
back
my
hair
this
last
condition
was
rather
a
staggerer
i
do
nothing
of
the
sort
said
conway
sulkily
then
the
thing
must
go
on
said
adams
with
dignity
rodgers
as
i
understand
it
is
your
second
conway
bailey
come
here
what
the
row
about
he
was
thrashing
binny
no
i
was
interrupted
conway
but
i
was
going
to
because
he
knows
who
put
meeks
mortar
over
our
door
and
i
know
well
enough
who
did
it
it
was
that
sneaking
little
mulatter
pointing
at
me
o
by
george
i
cried
reddening
at
the
insult
cool
is
the
word
said
adams
as
he
bound
a
handkerchief
round
my
head
and
carefully
tucked
away
the
long
straggling
locks
that
offered
a
tempting
advantage
to
the
enemy
who
ever
heard
of
a
fellow
with
such
a
head
of
hair
going
into
action
muttered
phil
twitching
the
handkerchief
to
ascertain
if
it
were
securely
tied
he
then
loosened
my
gallowses
braces
and
buckled
them
tightly
above
my
hips
now
then
bantam
never
say
die
conway
regarded
these
preparations
with
evident
misgiving
for
he
called
rodgers
to
his
side
and
had
himself
arrayed
in
a
similar
manner
though
his
hair
was
cropped
so
close
that
you
could
have
taken
hold
of
it
with
a
pair
of
tweezers
is
your
man
ready
asked
phil
adams
addressing
rodgers
ready
keep
your
back
to
the
gate
tom
whispered
phil
in
my
car
and
have
the
sun
in
his
behold
us
once
more
face
to
face
like
david
and
the
philistine
look
at
us
as
long
as
you
may
for
this
is
all
you
shall
see
of
the
combat
according
to
my
thinking
the
hospital
teaches
a
better
lesson
than
the
i
will
tell
you
about
my
black
eye
and
my
swollen
lip
if
you
will
but
not
a
word
of
the
fight
you
get
no
description
of
it
from
me
simply
because
i
think
it
would
prove
very
poor
reading
and
not
because
i
consider
my
revolt
against
conway
tyranny
unjustifiable
i
had
borne
conway
persecutions
for
many
months
with
patience
i
might
have
shielded
myself
by
appealing
to
grimshaw
but
no
boy
in
the
temple
grammar
school
could
do
that
without
losing
caste
whether
this
was
just
or
not
does
matter
a
pin
since
it
was
so
a
traditionary
law
of
the
place
the
personal
inconvenience
i
suffered
from
my
tormentor
was
nothing
to
the
pain
he
inflicted
on
me
indirectly
by
his
persistent
cruelty
to
little
binny
wallace
i
should
have
lacked
the
spirit
of
a
hen
if
i
had
not
resented
it
finally
i
am
glad
that
i
faced
conway
and
asked
no
favors
and
got
rid
of
him
forever
i
am
glad
that
phil
adams
taught
me
to
box
and
i
say
to
all
youngsters
learn
to
box
to
ride
to
pull
an
oar
and
to
swim
the
occasion
may
come
round
when
a
decent
proficiency
in
one
or
the
rest
of
these
accomplishments
will
be
of
service
to
you
in
one
of
the
best
books
ever
written
for
boys
are
these
words
learn
to
box
then
as
you
learn
to
play
cricket
and
football
not
one
of
you
will
be
the
worse
but
very
much
the
better
for
learning
to
box
well
should
you
never
have
to
use
it
in
earnest
there
no
exercise
in
the
world
so
good
for
the
temper
and
for
the
muscles
of
the
back
and
legs
as
for
fighting
keep
out
of
it
if
you
can
by
all
means
when
the
time
comes
if
ever
it
should
that
you
have
to
say
or
to
a
challenge
to
fight
say
if
you
can
only
take
care
you
make
it
plain
to
yourself
why
you
say
it
a
proof
of
the
highest
courage
if
done
from
true
christian
motives
it
quite
right
and
justifiable
if
done
from
a
simple
aversion
to
physical
pain
and
danger
but
do
say
because
you
fear
a
licking
and
say
or
think
it
because
you
fear
god
for
that
neither
christian
nor
honest
and
if
you
do
fight
fight
it
out
and
do
give
in
while
you
can
stand
and
and
do
give
in
when
you
ca
see
for
i
could
stand
very
little
and
see
not
at
all
having
pommelled
the
school
pump
for
the
last
twenty
seconds
when
conway
retired
from
the
field
as
phil
adams
stepped
up
to
shake
hands
with
me
he
received
a
telling
blow
in
the
stomach
for
all
the
fight
was
not
out
of
me
yet
and
i
mistook
him
for
a
new
adversary
convinced
of
my
error
i
accepted
his
congratulations
with
those
of
the
other
boys
blandly
and
blindly
i
remember
that
binny
wallace
wanted
to
give
me
his
silver
the
gentle
soul
had
stood
throughout
the
contest
with
his
face
turned
to
the
fence
suffering
untold
agony
a
good
wash
at
the
pump
and
a
cold
key
applied
to
my
eye
refreshed
me
amazingly
escorted
by
two
or
three
of
the
schoolfellows
i
walked
home
through
the
pleasant
autumn
twilight
battered
but
triumphant
as
i
went
along
my
cap
cocked
on
one
side
to
keep
the
chilly
air
from
my
eye
i
felt
that
i
was
not
only
following
my
nose
but
following
it
so
closely
that
i
was
in
some
danger
of
treading
on
it
i
seemed
to
have
nose
enough
for
the
whole
party
my
left
cheek
also
was
puffed
out
like
a
dumpling
i
could
help
saying
to
myself
if
this
is
victory
how
about
that
other
fellow
tom
said
harry
blake
hesitating
well
did
you
see
grimshaw
looking
out
of
the
window
just
as
we
left
the
yard
no
was
he
though
i
am
sure
of
then
he
must
have
seen
all
the
should
no
he
did
broke
in
adams
or
he
would
have
stopped
it
short
metre
but
i
guess
be
saw
you
pitching
into
the
pump
which
you
did
uncommonly
strong
and
of
course
be
smelt
mischief
well
it
ca
be
helped
now
i
reflected
as
the
monkey
said
when
he
fell
out
of
the
cocoanut
tree
added
charley
marden
trying
to
make
me
laugh
it
was
early
when
we
reached
the
house
miss
abigail
opening
the
front
door
started
back
at
my
hilarious
appearance
i
tried
to
smile
upon
her
sweetly
but
the
smile
rippling
over
my
swollen
cheek
and
dying
away
like
a
spent
wave
on
my
nose
produced
an
expression
of
which
miss
abigail
declared
she
had
never
seen
the
like
excepting
on
the
face
of
a
chinese
idol
she
hustled
me
unceremoniously
into
the
presence
of
my
grandfather
in
the
captain
nutter
as
the
recognized
professional
warrior
of
our
family
could
not
consistently
take
me
to
task
for
fighting
conway
nor
was
he
disposed
to
do
so
for
the
captain
was
well
aware
of
the
provocation
i
had
endured
ah
you
rascal
cried
the
old
gentleman
after
hearing
my
story
just
like
me
when
i
was
young
always
in
one
kind
of
trouble
or
another
i
believe
it
runs
in
the
i
think
said
miss
abigail
without
the
faintest
expression
on
her
countenance
that
a
of
the
captain
interrupted
miss
abigail
peremptorily
directing
her
to
make
a
shade
out
of
cardboard
and
black
silk
to
tie
over
my
eye
miss
abigail
must
have
been
possessed
with
the
idea
that
i
had
taken
up
pugilism
as
a
profession
for
she
turned
out
no
fewer
than
six
of
these
blinders
they
be
handy
to
have
in
the
house
says
miss
abigail
grimly
of
course
so
great
a
breach
of
discipline
was
not
to
be
passed
over
by
grimshaw
he
had
as
we
suspected
witnessed
the
closing
scene
of
the
fight
from
the
window
and
the
next
morning
after
prayers
i
was
not
wholly
unprepared
when
master
conway
and
myself
were
called
up
to
the
desk
for
examination
conway
with
a
piece
of
in
the
shape
of
a
maltese
cross
on
his
right
cheek
and
i
with
the
silk
patch
over
my
left
eye
caused
a
general
titter
through
the
room
silence
said
grimshaw
sharply
as
the
reader
is
already
familiar
with
the
leading
points
in
the
case
of
bailey
versus
conway
i
shall
not
report
the
trial
further
than
to
say
that
adams
marden
and
several
other
pupils
testified
to
the
fact
that
conway
had
imposed
on
me
ever
since
my
first
day
at
the
temple
school
their
evidence
also
went
to
show
that
conway
was
a
quarrelsome
character
generally
bad
for
conway
seth
rodgers
on
the
part
of
his
friend
proved
that
i
had
struck
the
first
blow
that
was
bad
for
me
if
you
please
sir
said
binny
wallace
holding
up
his
hand
for
permission
to
speak
bailey
did
fight
on
his
own
account
he
fought
on
my
account
and
if
you
please
sir
i
am
the
boy
to
be
blamed
for
i
was
the
cause
of
the
this
drew
out
the
story
of
conway
harsh
treatment
of
the
smaller
boys
as
binny
related
the
wrongs
of
his
playfellows
saying
very
little
of
his
own
grievances
i
noticed
that
grimshaw
hand
unknown
to
himself
perhaps
rested
lightly
from
time
to
time
on
wallace
sunny
hair
the
examination
finished
grimshaw
leaned
on
the
desk
thoughtfully
for
a
moment
and
then
said
every
boy
in
this
school
knows
that
it
is
against
the
rules
to
fight
if
one
boy
maltreats
another
within
or
within
that
is
a
matter
for
me
to
settle
the
case
should
be
laid
before
me
i
disapprove
of
i
never
encourage
it
in
the
slightest
degree
but
when
one
pupil
systematically
persecutes
a
schoolmate
it
is
the
duty
of
some
to
inform
me
no
pupil
has
a
right
to
take
the
law
into
his
own
hands
if
there
is
any
fighting
to
be
done
i
am
the
person
to
be
consulted
i
disapprove
of
boys
fighting
it
is
unnecessary
and
unchristian
in
the
present
instance
i
consider
every
large
boy
in
this
school
at
fault
but
as
the
offence
is
one
of
omission
rather
than
commission
my
punishment
must
rest
only
on
the
two
boys
convicted
of
misdemeanor
conway
loses
his
recess
for
a
month
and
bailey
has
a
page
added
to
his
latin
lessons
for
the
next
four
recitations
i
now
request
bailey
and
conway
to
shake
hands
in
the
presence
of
the
school
and
acknowledge
their
regret
at
what
has
conway
and
i
approached
each
other
slowly
and
cautiously
as
if
we
were
bent
upon
another
hostile
collision
we
clasped
hands
in
the
tamest
manner
imaginable
and
conway
mumbled
i
sorry
i
fought
with
i
think
you
are
i
replied
drily
and
i
sorry
i
had
to
thrash
you
can
go
to
your
seats
said
grimshaw
turning
his
face
aside
to
hide
a
smile
i
am
sure
my
apology
was
a
very
good
one
i
never
had
any
more
trouble
with
conway
he
and
his
shadow
seth
rodgers
gave
me
a
wide
berth
for
many
months
nor
was
binny
wallace
subjected
to
further
molestation

with

dangling
from

crawling
over
my
face
when
i
lay
asleep
i
used
to
keep
the
little
beggars
in
my
bedroom
greatly
to
the
annoyance
of
miss
abigail
who
was
constantly
fancying
that
one
of
the
mice
had
secreted
itself
somewhere
about
her
person
i
also
owned
a
dog
a
terrier
who
managed
in
some
inscrutable
way
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
the
moon
and
on
bright
nights
kept
up
such
a
in
our
back
garden
that
we
were
finally
forced
to
dispose
of
him
at
private
sale
he
was
purchased
by
oxford
the
butcher
i
protested
against
the
arrangement
and
ever
afterwards
when
we
had
sausages
from
oxford
shop
i
made
believe
i
detected
in
them
certain
evidences
that
cato
had
been
foully
dealt
with
of
birds
i
had
no
end
robins
wrens
bulfinches
bobolinks
ringdoves
and
pigeons
at
one
time
i
took
solid
comfort
in
the
iniquitous
society
of
a
dissipated
old
parrot
who
talked
so
terribly
that
the
rev
wibird
hawkins
happening
to
get
a
sample
of
poll
vituperative
powers
pronounced
him
a
benighted
heathen
and
advised
the
captain
to
get
rid
of
him
a
brace
of
turtles
supplanted
the
parrot
in
my
affections
the
turtles
gave
way
to
rabbits
and
the
rabbits
in
turn
yielded
to
the
superior
charms
of
a
small
monkey
which
the
captain
bought
of
a
sailor
lately
from
the
coast
of
africa
but
gypsy
was
the
prime
favorite
in
spite
of
many
rivals
i
never
grew
weary
of
her
she
was
the
most
knowing
little
thing
in
the
world
her
proper
sphere
in
life
and
the
one
to
which
she
ultimately
attained
was
the
arena
of
a
travelling
circus
there
was
nothing
short
of
the
three
r
reading
and
that
gypsy
could
be
taught
the
gift
of
speech
was
not
hers
but
the
faculty
of
thought
was
my
little
friend
to
be
sure
was
not
exempt
from
certain
graceful
weaknesses
inseparable
perhaps
from
the
female
character
she
was
very
pretty
and
she
knew
it
she
was
also
passionately
fond
of
dress
by
which
i
mean
her
best
harness
when
she
had
this
on
her
curvetings
and
prancings
were
laughable
though
in
ordinary
tackle
she
went
along
demurely
enough
there
was
something
in
the
enamelled
leather
and
the
mountings
that
chimed
with
her
artistic
sense
to
have
her
mane
braided
and
a
rose
or
a
pansy
stuck
into
her
forelock
was
to
make
her
too
conceited
for
anything
she
had
another
trait
not
rare
among
her
sex
she
liked
the
attentions
of
young
gentlemen
while
the
society
of
girls
bored
her
she
would
drag
them
sulkily
in
the
cart
but
as
for
permitting
one
of
them
in
the
saddle
the
idea
was
preposterous
once
when
pepper
whitcomb
sister
in
spite
of
our
remonstrances
ventured
to
mount
her
gypsy
gave
a
little
indignant
neigh
and
tossed
the
gentle
emma
heels
over
head
in
no
time
but
with
any
of
the
boys
the
mare
was
as
docile
as
a
lamb
her
treatment
of
the
several
members
of
the
family
was
comical
for
the
captain
she
entertained
a
wholesome
respect
and
was
always
on
her
good
behavior
when
he
was
around
as
to
miss
abigail
gypsy
simply
laughed
at
her
literally
laughed
contracting
her
upper
lip
and
displaying
all
her
teeth
as
if
something
about
miss
abigail
struck
her
gypsy
as
being
extremely
ridiculous
kitty
collins
for
some
reason
or
another
was
afraid
of
the
pony
or
pretended
to
be
the
sagacious
little
animal
knew
it
of
course
and
frequently
when
kitty
was
banging
out
clothes
near
the
stable
the
mare
being
loose
in
the
yard
would
make
short
plunges
at
her
once
gypsy
seized
the
basket
of
clothespins
with
her
teeth
and
rising
on
her
hind
legs
pawing
the
air
with
her
fore
feet
followed
kitty
clear
up
to
the
scullery
steps
that
part
of
the
yard
was
shut
off
from
the
rest
by
a
gate
but
no
gate
was
proof
against
gypsy
ingenuity
she
could
let
down
bars
lift
up
latches
draw
bolts
and
turn
all
sorts
of
buttons
this
accomplishment
rendered
it
hazardous
for
miss
abigail
or
kitty
to
leave
any
eatables
on
the
kitchen
table
near
the
window
on
one
occasion
gypsy
put
in
her
head
and
lapped
up
six
custard
pies
that
had
been
placed
by
the
casement
to
cool
an
account
of
my
young
lady
various
pranks
would
fill
a
thick
volume
a
favorite
trick
of
hers
on
being
requested
to
walk
like
miss
abigail
was
to
assume
a
little
skittish
gait
so
true
to
nature
that
miss
abigail
herself
was
obliged
to
admit
the
cleverness
of
the
imitation
the
idea
of
putting
gypsy
through
a
systematic
course
of
instruction
was
suggested
to
me
by
a
visit
to
the
circus
which
gave
an
annual
performance
in
rivermouth
this
show
embraced
among
its
attractions
a
number
of
trained
shetland
ponies
and
i
determined
that
gypsy
should
likewise
have
the
benefit
of
a
liberal
education
i
succeeded
in
teaching
her
to
waltz
to
fire
a
pistol
by
tugging
at
a
string
tied
to
the
trigger
to
lie
down
dead
to
wink
one
eye
and
to
execute
many
other
feats
of
a
difficult
nature
she
took
to
her
studies
admirably
and
enjoyed
the
whole
thing
as
much
as
anyone
the
monkey
was
a
perpetual
marvel
to
gypsy
they
became
in
an
incredibly
brief
period
and
were
never
easy
out
of
each
sight
prince
zany
that
what
pepper
whitcomb
and
i
christened
him
one
day
much
to
the
disgust
of
the
monkey
who
bit
a
piece
out
of
nose
resided
in
the
stable
and
went
to
roost
every
night
on
the
back
where
i
usually
found
him
in
the
morning
whenever
i
rode
out
i
was
obliged
to
secure
his
highness
the
prince
with
a
stout
cord
to
the
fence
he
chattering
all
the
time
like
a
madman
one
afternoon
as
i
was
cantering
through
the
crowded
part
of
the
town
i
noticed
that
the
people
in
the
street
stopped
stared
at
me
and
fell
to
laughing
i
turned
round
in
the
saddle
and
there
was
zany
with
a
great
burdock
leaf
in
his
paw
perched
up
behind
me
on
the
crupper
as
solemn
as
a
judge
after
a
few
months
poor
zany
sickened
mysteriously
and
died
the
dark
thought
occurred
to
me
then
and
comes
back
to
me
now
with
redoubled
force
that
miss
abigail
must
have
given
him
some
zany
left
a
large
circle
of
sorrowing
friends
if
not
relatives
gypsy
i
think
never
entirely
recovered
from
the
shock
occasioned
by
his
early
demise
she
became
fonder
of
me
though
and
one
of
her
cunningest
demonstrations
was
to
escape
from
the
and
trot
up
to
the
door
of
the
temple
grammar
school
where
i
would
discover
her
at
recess
patiently
waiting
for
me
with
her
fore
feet
on
the
second
step
and
wisps
of
straw
standing
out
all
over
her
like
quills
upon
the
fretful
porcupine
i
should
fail
if
i
tried
to
tell
you
how
dear
the
pony
was
to
me
even
hard
unloving
men
become
attached
to
the
horses
they
take
care
of
so
i
who
was
neither
unloving
nor
hard
grew
to
love
every
glossy
hair
of
the
pretty
little
creature
that
depended
on
me
for
her
soft
straw
bed
and
her
daily
modicum
of
oats
in
my
prayer
at
night
i
never
forgot
to
mention
gypsy
with
the
rest
of
the
family
generally
setting
forth
her
claims
first
whatever
relates
to
gypsy
belongs
properly
to
this
narrative
therefore
i
offer
no
apology
for
rescuing
from
oblivion
and
boldly
printing
here
a
short
composition
which
i
wrote
in
the
early
part
of
my
first
quarter
at
the
temple
grammar
school
it
is
my
maiden
effort
in
a
difficult
art
and
is
perhaps
lacking
in
those
graces
of
thought
and
style
which
are
reached
only
after
the
severest
practice
every
wednesday
morning
on
entering
school
each
pupil
was
expected
to
lay
his
exercise
on
grimshaw
desk
the
subject
was
usually
selected
by
grimshaw
himself
the
monday
previous
with
a
humor
characteristic
of
him
our
teacher
had
instituted
two
prizes
one
for
the
best
and
the
other
for
the
worst
composition
of
the
month
the
first
prize
consisted
of
a
penknife
or
a
or
some
such
article
dear
to
the
heart
of
youth
the
second
prize
entitled
the
winner
to
wear
for
an
hour
or
two
a
sort
of
conical
paper
cap
on
the
front
of
which
was
written
in
tall
letters
this
modest
admission
i
am
a
dunce
the
competitor
who
took
prize
no
was
generally
an
object
of
envy
my
pulse
beat
high
with
pride
and
expectation
that
wednesday
morning
as
i
laid
my
essay
neatly
folded
on
the
master
table
i
firmly
decline
to
say
which
prize
i
won
but
here
the
composition
to
speak
for
itself
it
is
no
vanity
that
induces
me
to
publish
this
stray
leaf
of
natural
history
i
lay
it
before
our
young
folks
not
for
their
admiration
but
for
their
criticism
let
each
reader
take
his
and
remorselessly
correct
the
orthography
the
capitalization
and
the
punctuation
of
the
essay
i
shall
not
feel
hurt
at
seeing
my
treatise
cut
all
to
pieces
though
i
think
highly
of
the
production
not
on
account
of
its
literary
excellence
which
i
candidly
admit
is
not
overpowering
but
because
it
was
written
years
and
years
ago
about
gypsy
by
a
little
fellow
who
when
i
strive
to
recall
him
appears
to
me
like
a
reduced
ghost
of
my
present
self
i
am
confident
that
any
reader
who
has
ever
had
pets
birds
or
animals
will
forgive
me
for
this
brief
digression
chapter
twelve
winter
at
rivermouth
i
guess
we
going
to
have
a
regular
snowstorm
said
captain
nutter
one
bleak
december
morning
casting
a
peculiarly
nautical
glance
skyward
the
captain
was
always
hazarding
prophecies
about
the
weather
which
somehow
never
turned
out
according
to
his
prediction
the
vanes
on
the
seemed
to
take
fiendish
pleasure
in
humiliating
the
dear
old
gentleman
if
he
said
it
was
going
to
be
a
clear
day
a
dense
was
pretty
certain
to
set
in
before
noon
once
he
caused
a
protracted
drought
by
assuring
us
every
morning
for
six
consecutive
weeks
that
it
would
rain
in
a
few
hours
but
sure
enough
that
afternoon
it
began
snowing
now
i
had
not
seen
a
since
i
was
eighteen
months
old
and
of
course
remembered
nothing
about
it
a
boy
familiar
from
his
infancy
with
the
rigors
of
our
new
england
winters
can
form
no
idea
of
the
impression
made
on
me
by
this
natural
phenomenon
my
delight
and
surprise
were
as
boundless
as
if
the
heavy
gray
sky
had
let
down
a
shower
of
pond
lilies
and
white
roses
instead
of
it
happened
to
be
a
so
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
watch
the
feathery
crystals
whirling
hither
and
thither
through
the
air
i
stood
by
the
window
gazing
at
the
wonder
until
twilight
shut
out
the
novel
scene
we
had
had
several
slight
flurries
of
hail
and
snow
before
but
this
was
a
regular
several
inches
of
snow
had
already
fallen
the
at
the
door
drooped
with
the
weight
of
their
magical
blossoms
and
the
two
posts
that
held
the
garden
gate
were
transformed
into
stately
turks
with
white
turbans
guarding
the
entrance
to
the
nutter
house
the
storm
increased
at
sundown
and
continued
with
unabated
violence
through
the
night
the
next
morning
when
i
jumped
out
of
bed
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
the
cloudless
heavens
wore
the
tender
azure
of
june
and
the
whole
earth
lay
muffled
up
to
the
eyes
as
it
were
in
a
thick
mantle
of
down
it
was
a
very
deep
snow
the
oldest
inhabitant
what
would
become
of
a
new
england
town
or
village
without
its
oldest
inhabitant
overhauled
his
almanacs
and
pronounced
it
the
deepest
snow
we
had
had
for
twenty
years
it
could
have
been
much
deeper
without
smothering
us
all
our
street
was
a
sight
to
be
seen
or
rather
it
was
a
sight
not
to
be
seen
for
very
little
street
was
visible
one
huge
drift
completely
banked
up
our
front
door
and
half
covered
my
bedroom
window
there
was
no
school
that
day
for
all
the
thoroughfares
were
impassable
by
twelve
however
the
great
snowploughs
each
drawn
by
four
yokes
of
oxen
broke
a
through
the
principal
streets
but
the
had
a
hard
time
of
it
floundering
in
the
arctic
drifts
the
captain
and
i
cut
a
tunnel
three
feet
wide
and
six
feet
high
from
our
front
door
to
the
sidewalk
opposite
it
was
a
beautiful
cavern
with
its
walls
and
roof
inlaid
with
and
diamonds
i
am
sure
the
ice
palace
of
the
russian
empress
in
cowper
poem
was
not
a
more
superb
piece
of
architecture
the
thermometer
began
falling
shortly
before
sunset
and
we
had
the
bitterest
cold
night
i
ever
experienced
this
brought
out
the
oldest
inhabitant
again
the
next
day
and
what
a
gay
old
boy
he
was
for
deciding
everything
our
tunnel
was
turned
into
solid
ice
a
crust
thick
enough
to
bear
men
and
horses
had
formed
over
the
snow
everywhere
and
the
air
was
alive
with
merry
icy
stalactites
a
yard
long
bung
from
the
eaves
of
the
house
and
the
turkish
sentinels
at
the
gate
looked
as
if
they
had
given
up
all
hopes
of
ever
being
relieved
from
duty
so
the
winter
set
in
cold
and
glittering
everything
was
sheathed
in
silver
mail
to
quote
from
charley
marden
it
was
cold
enough
to
freeze
the
tail
off
a
brass
monkey
an
observation
which
seemed
to
me
extremely
happy
though
i
knew
little
or
nothing
concerning
the
endurance
of
brass
monkeys
having
never
seen
one
i
had
looked
forward
to
the
advent
of
the
season
with
grave
apprehensions
nerving
myself
to
meet
dreary
nights
and
monotonous
days
but
summer
itself
was
not
more
jolly
than
winter
at
rivermouth
at
school
skating
on
the
mill
pond
coasting
by
moonlight
long
rides
behind
gypsy
in
a
little
sleigh
built
expressly
for
her
were
sports
no
less
exhilarating
than
those
which
belonged
to
the
sunny
months
and
then
thanksgiving
the
nose
of
memory
why
memory
have
a
nose
dilates
with
pleasure
over
the
rich
perfume
of
miss
abigail
forty
each
one
more
delightful
than
the
other
like
the
sultan
forty
wives
christmas
was
another
day
though
it
was
not
so
generally
observed
in
new
england
as
it
is
now
the
great
in
the
tiled
made
our
very
cheerful
of
winter
nights
when
the
howled
about
the
eaves
and
the
sharp
fingers
of
the
sleet
tapped
against
the
it
was
nice
to
be
so
warmly
sheltered
from
the
storm
a
dish
of
apples
and
a
pitcher
of
chilly
cider
were
always
served
during
the
evening
the
captain
had
a
funny
way
of
leaning
back
in
the
chair
and
eating
his
apple
with
his
eyes
closed
sometimes
i
played
dominos
with
him
and
sometimes
miss
abigail
read
aloud
to
us
pronouncing
to
toe
and
sounding
all
the
eds
in
a
former
chapter
i
alluded
to
miss
abigail
managing
propensities
she
had
affected
many
changes
in
the
nutter
house
before
i
came
there
to
live
but
there
was
one
thing
against
which
she
had
long
contended
without
being
able
to
overcome
this
was
the
captain
pipe
on
first
taking
command
of
the
household
she
prohibited
smoking
in
the
where
it
had
been
the
old
gentleman
custom
to
take
a
whiff
or
two
of
the
fragrant
weed
after
meals
the
edict
went
forth
and
so
did
the
pipe
an
excellent
move
no
doubt
but
then
the
house
was
his
and
if
he
saw
fit
to
keep
a
tub
of
tobacco
burning
in
the
middle
of
the
parlor
floor
he
had
a
perfect
right
to
do
so
however
he
humored
her
in
this
as
in
other
matters
and
smoked
by
stealth
like
a
guilty
creature
in
the
barn
or
about
the
gardens
that
was
practicable
in
summer
but
in
winter
the
captain
was
hard
put
to
it
when
he
stand
it
longer
he
retreated
to
his
bedroom
and
barricaded
the
door
such
was
the
position
of
affairs
at
the
time
of
which
i
write
one
morning
a
few
days
after
the
great
snow
as
miss
abigail
was
dusting
the
chronometer
in
the
ball
she
beheld
captain
nutter
slowly
descending
the
staircase
with
a
long
clay
pipe
in
his
mouth
miss
abigail
could
hardly
credit
her
own
eyes
she
gasped
retiring
heavily
on
the
the
tone
of
reproach
with
which
this
word
was
uttered
failed
to
produce
the
slightest
effect
on
the
captain
who
merely
removed
the
pipe
from
his
lips
for
an
instant
and
blew
a
cloud
into
the
chilly
air
the
thermometer
stood
at
two
degrees
below
zero
in
our
hall
cried
miss
abigail
hysterically
do
come
near
me
whereupon
she
fainted
away
for
the
smell
of
always
made
her
deadly
sick
kitty
collins
rushed
from
the
kitchen
with
a
basin
of
water
and
set
to
work
bathing
miss
abigail
temples
and
chafing
her
hands
i
thought
my
grandfather
rather
cruel
as
he
stood
there
with
a
on
his
countenance
complacently
watching
miss
abigail
sufferings
when
she
was
brought
to
the
captain
sat
down
beside
her
and
with
a
lovely
twinkle
in
his
eye
said
softly
abigail
my
dear
there
was
any
tobacco
in
that
pipe
it
was
a
new
pipe
i
fetched
it
down
for
tom
to
blow
at
these
words
kitty
collins
hurried
away
her
strangely
several
minutes
later
i
came
upon
her
in
the
scullery
with
the
greater
portion
of
a
crash
towel
stuffed
into
her
mouth
miss
abygil
smelt
the
terbacca
with
her
oi
cried
kitty
partially
removing
the
cloth
and
then
immediately
stopping
herself
up
again
the
captain
joke
furnished
us
that
is
kitty
and
me
with
mirth
for
many
a
day
as
to
miss
abigail
i
think
she
never
wholly
pardoned
him
after
this
captain
nutter
gradually
gave
up
smoking
which
is
an
untidy
injurious
disgraceful
and
highly
pleasant
habit
a
boy
life
in
a
secluded
new
england
town
in
winter
does
not
afford
many
points
for
illustration
of
course
he
gets
his
ears
or
toes
of
course
he
smashes
his
sled
against
another
boy
of
course

bangs
his
bead
on
the
ice

he
a
lad
of
no
enterprise
whatever
if
he
does
manage
to
skate
into
an
and
be
brought
home
half
drowned
all
these
things
happened
to
me
but
as
they
lack
novelty
i
pass
them
over
to
tell
you
about
the
famous
which
we
built
on
slatter
hill
chapter
thirteen
the
snow
fort
on
slatter
hill
the
memory
of
man
even
that
of
the
oldest
inhabitant
runneth
not
back
to
the
time
when
there
did
not
exist
a
feud
between
the
north
end
and
the
south
end
boys
of
rivermouth
the
origin
of
the
feud
is
involved
in
mystery
it
is
impossible
to
say
which
party
was
the
first
aggressor
in
the
anterevolutionary
ages
but
the
fact
remains
that
the
youngsters
of
those
antipodal
sections
entertained
a
mortal
hatred
for
each
other
and
that
this
hatred
had
been
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
like
miles
standish
i
know
not
what
laws
natural
or
unnatural
regulated
the
warmth
of
the
quarrel
but
at
some
seasons
it
raged
more
violently
than
at
others
this
winter
both
parties
were
unusually
lively
and
antagonistic
great
was
the
wrath
of
the
when
they
discovered
that
the
had
thrown
up
a
fort
on
the
crown
of
slatter
hill
slatter
hill
or
as
it
was
generally
called
was
a
rise
of
ground
covering
perhaps
an
acre
and
a
quarter
situated
on
an
imaginary
line
marking
the
boundary
between
the
two
districts
an
immense
stratum
of
granite
which
here
and
there
thrust
out
a
wrinkled
boulder
prevented
the
site
from
being
used
for
building
purposes
the
street
ran
on
either
side
of
the
hill
from
one
part
of
which
a
quantity
of
rock
had
been
removed
to
form
the
underpinning
of
the
new
jail
this
excavation
made
the
approach
from
that
point
all
but
impossible
especially
when
the
ragged
ledges
were
with
ice
you
see
what
a
spot
it
was
for
a
one
evening
twenty
or
thirty
of
the
quietly
took
possession
of
slatter
hill
and
threw
up
a
strong
line
of
breastworks

the
rear
of
the
entrenchment

walls
were
four
feet
high
and

thick
strengthened
at
the
angles
by
stakes
driven
firmly
into

fancy
the
rage
of
the
the
next
day
when
they
spied
our
snowy
citadel
with

floating
defiantly
from

were
the
derisive

fifty
strong

ames
our
forces
were
under
the
command
of
general
harris
before
the
action
commenced
a
meeting
was
arranged
between
the
rival
commanders
who
drew
up
and
signed
certain
rules
and
regulations
respecting
the
conduct
of
the
battle
as
it
was
impossible
for
the
to
occupy
the
fort
permanently
it
was
stipulated
that
the
should
assault
it
only
on
wednesday

saturday
afternoons

the
hours
of
two
and
six
for
them
to
take
possession
of
the
place
at
any
other
time
was
not
to
constitute
a
capture
but
on
the
contrary
was
to
be
considered
a
dishonorable
and
cowardly
act
the
on
the
other
hand
agreed
to
give
up
the
fort
whenever
ten
of
the
storming
party
succeeded
in
obtaining
at
one
time
a
footing
on
the
parapet

were
able
to
hold
the

respective
corps
the
interview
had
taken
place
on
the
hillside
between
the
opposing
lines
general
harris
divided
his
men
into
two
bodies
the
first
comprised
the
most
skilful
marksmen
or
gunners
the
second
the
reserve
force
was
composed
of
the
strongest
boys
whose
duty
it
was
to
repel
the
scaling
parties
and
to
make
occasional
sallies
for
the
purpose
of
capturing
prisoners
who
were
bound
by
the
articles
of
treaty
to
faithfully
serve
under
our
flag
until
they
were
exchanged
at
the
close
of
the
day
the
repellers
were
called
light
infantry
but
when
they
carried
on
operations
beyond
the
fort
they
became
cavalry
it
was
also
their
duty

of
five

his
army
five
companies
each
numbering

six
men
in
order
not
to
present
too
big
a
target
to
our
sharpshooters

to
charge
the
fort
from
different
points
their
advance
being
covered
by
a
heavy
fire
from
the
gunners
posted
in
the
rear
each
scaler
was
provided
with
only
two
rounds
of
ammunition
which
were
not
to
be
used
until
he
had
mounted
the
breastwork
and
could
deliver
his
shots
on
our
heads
the

the
thrilling
moment

arrived
if

had
been
going
into
a
real
engagement
i
could
not
have
been
more
deeply
impressed
by
the
importance
of
the
occasion
the
fort
opened
fire
first
a
single
ball
from
the
dexterous
band
of
general
harris
taking
general
ames
in
the
very
pit
of
his
stomach
a
cheer
went
up
from
fort
slatter
in
an
instant
the
air
was
thick
with
flying
missiles
in
the
midst
of
which
we
dimly
descried
the
storming
parties
sweeping
up
the
hill
shoulder
to
shoulder
the
shouts
of
the
leaders
and
the
snowballs
bursting
like
shells
about
our
ears
made
it
very
lively
not
more
than
a
dozen
of
the
enemy
succeeded
in
reaching
the
crest
of
the
hill
five
of
these
clambered
upon
the
icy
walls
where
they
were
instantly
grabbed
by
the
legs
and
jerked
into
the
fort
the
rest
retired
confused
and
blinded
by
our
fire
when
general
harris
with
his
right
eye
bunged
up
said
soldiers
i
am
proud
of
you
my
heart
swelled
in
my
bosom
the
victory
however
had
not
been
without
its
price
six
having
rushed
out
to
harass
the
discomfited
enemy
were
gallantly
cut
off
by
general
ames
and
captured
among
these
were
lieutenant
whitcomb
who
had
no
business
to
join
in
the
charge
being
weak
in
the
knees
and
captain
fred
langdon
of
general
harris
staff
whitcomb
was
one
of
the
most
notable
shots
on
our
side
though
he
was
not
much
to
boast
of
in
a
fight
owing
to
the
weakness
before
mentioned
general
ames
put
him
among
the
gunners
and
we
were
quickly
made
aware
of
the
loss
we
had
sustained
by
receiving
a
frequent
artful
ball
which
seemed
to
light
with
unerring
instinct
on
any
nose
that
was
the
least
bit
exposed
i
have
known
one
of
pepper
fired
pointblank
to
turn
a
corner
and
hit
a
boy
who
considered
himself
absolutely
safe
but
we
had
no
time
for
vain
regrets
the
battle
raged
already
there
were
two
bad
cases
of
black
eye
and
one
of
nosebleed
in
the
hospital
it
was
glorious
excitement
those
onslaughts
and
struggles
twice
we
were
within
an
ace
of
being
driven
from
our
stronghold
when
general
harris
and
his
staff
leaped
recklessly
upon
the
ramparts
and
hurled
the
besiegers
heels
over
head
down
hill
at
sunset
the
garrison
of
fort
slatter
was
still
unconquered
and
the
in
a
solid
phalanx
marched
off
whistling
yankee
doodle
while
we
cheered
and
jeered
them
until
they
were
out
of
hearing
general
ames
remained
behind
to
effect
an
exchange
of
prisoners
we
held
thirteen
of
his
men
and
he
eleven
of
ours
general
ames
proposed
to
call
it
an
even
thing
since
many
of
his
eleven
prisoners
were
officers
while
nearly
all
our
thirteen
captives
were
privates
a
dispute
arising
on
this
point
the
two
noble
generals
came
to
fisticuffs
and
in
the
fracas
our
brave
commander
got
his
remaining
well
eye
badly
damaged
this
did
prevent
him
from
writing
a
general
order
the
next
day
on
a
slate
in
which
he
complimented
the
troops
on
their
heroic
behavior
on
the
following
wednesday
the
siege
was
renewed
i
forget
whether
it
was
on
that
afternoon
or
the
next
that
we
lost
fort
slatter
but
lose
it
we
did
with
much
valuable
ammunition
and
several
men
after
a
series
of
desperate
assaults
we
forced
general
ames
to
capitulate
and
he
in
turn
made
the
place
too
hot
to
hold
us
so
from
day
to
day
the
tide
of
battle
surged
to
and
fro
sometimes
favoring
our
arms
and
sometimes
those
of
the
enemy
general
ames
handled
his
men
with
great
skill
his
deadliest
foe
could
not
deny
that
once
he
outgeneralled
our
commander
in
the
following
manner
he
massed
his
gunners
on
our
left
and
opened
a
brisk
fire
under
cover
of
which
a
single
company
six
men
advanced
on
that
angle
of
the
fort
our
reserves
on
the
right
rushed
over
to
defend
the
threatened
point
meanwhile
four
companies
of
the
enemy
scalers
made
a
detour
round
the
foot
of
the
hill
and
dashed
into
fort
slatter
without
opposition
at
the
same
moment
general
ames
gunners
closed
in
on
our
left
and
there
we
were
between
two
fires
of
course
we
had
to
vacate
the
fort
a
cloud
rested
on
general
harris
military
reputation
until
his
superior
tactics
enabled
him
to
dispossess
the
enemy
as
the
winter
wore
on
the
waxed
fiercer
and
fiercer
at
length
the
provision
against
using
heavy
substances
in
the
was
disregarded
a
ball
stuck
full
of
shot
came
tearing
into
fort
slatter
in
retaliation
general
harris
ordered
a
broadside
of
shells
containing
marbles
after
this
both
sides
never
failed
to
freeze
their
ammunition
it
was
no
longer
child
play
to
march
up
to
the
walls
of
fort
slatter
nor
was
the
position
of
the
besieged
less
perilous
at
every
assault
three
or
four
boys
on
each
side
were
disabled
it
was
not
an
infrequent
occurrence
for
the
combatants
to
hold
up
a
flag
of
truce
while
they
removed
some
insensible
comrade
matters
grew
worse
and
worse
seven
had
been
seriously
wounded
and
a
dozen
were
reported
on
the
sick
list
the
selectmen
of
the
town
awoke
to
the
fact
of
what
was
going
on
and
detailed
a
posse
of
police
to
prevent
further
disturbance
the
boys
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
as
it
happened
finding
themselves
assailed
in
the
rear
and
on
the
flank
turned
round
and
attempted
to
beat
off
the
watchmen
in
this
they
were
sustained
by
numerous
volunteers
from
the
fort
who
looked
upon
the
interference
as
tyrannical
the
watch
were
determined
fellows
and
charged
the
boys
valiantly
driving
them
all
into
the
fort
where
we
made
common
cause
fighting
side
by
side
like
the
best
of
friends
in
vain
the
four
guardians
of
the
peace
rushed
up
the
hill
flourishing
their
clubs
and
calling
upon
us
to
surrender
they
could
not
get
within
ten
yards
of
the
fort
our
fire
was
so
destructive
in
one
of
the
onsets
a
man
named
mugridge
more
valorous
than
his
peers
threw
himself
upon
the
parapet
when
he
was
seized
by
twenty
pairs
of
hands
and
dragged
inside
the
breastwork
where
fifteen
boys
sat
down
on
him
to
keep
him
quiet
perceiving
that
it
was
impossible
with
their
small
number
to
dislodge
us
the
watch
sent
for
reinforcements
their
call
was
responded
to
not
only
by
the
whole
constabulary
force
eight
men
but
by
a
numerous
body
of
citizens
who
had
become
alarmed
at
the
prospect
of
a
riot
this
formidable
array
brought
us
to
our
senses
we
began
to
think
that
maybe
discretion
was
the
better
part
of
valor
general
harris
and
general
ames
with
their
respective
staffs
held
a
council
of
war
in
the
hospital
and
a
backward
movement
was
decided
on
so
after
one
grand
farewell
volley
we
fled
sliding
jumping
rolling
tumbling
down
the
quarry
at
the
rear
of
the
fort
and
escaped
without
losing
a
man
but
we
lost
fort
slatter
forever
those
ramparts
were
razed
to
the
ground
and
humiliating
ashes
sprinkled
over
the
historic
spot
near
which
a
solitary
policeman
was
seen
prowling
from
time
to
time
during
the
rest
of
the
winter
the
event
passed
into
a
legend
and
afterwards
when
later
instances
of
pluck
and
endurance
were
spoken
of
the
boys
would
say
by
golly
you
ought
to
have

fights

education
behold
me
however
well
up
in
most
of
the
classes
i
have
worn
my
latin
grammar
into
tatters
and
am
in
the
first
book
of
virgil
i
interlard
my
conversation
at
home
with
easy
quotations
from
that
poet
and
impress
captain
nutter
with
a
lofty
notion
of
my
learning
i
am
likewise
translating
les
aventures
de
telemaque
from
the
french
and
shall
tackle
blair
lectures
the
next
term
i
am
ashamed
of
my
crude
composition
about
the
horse
and
can
do
better
now
sometimes
my
head
almost
aches
with
the
variety
of
my
knowledge
i
consider
grimshaw
the
greatest
scholar
that
ever
lived
and
i
do
know
which
i
would
rather
be
a
learned
man
like
him
or
a
circus
rider
my
thoughts
revert
to
this
particular
spring
more
frequently
than
to
any
other
period
of
my
boyhood
for
it
was
marked
by
an
event
that
left
an
indelible
impression
on
my
memory
as
i
pen
these
pages
i
feel
that
i
am
writing
of
something
which
happened
yesterday
so
vividly
it
all
comes
back
to
me
every
rivermouth
boy
looks
upon
the
sea
as
being
in
some
way
mixed
up
with
his
destiny
while
he
is
yet
a
baby
lying
in
his
cradle
he
hears
the
dull
boom
of
the
breakers
when
he
is
older
he
wanders
by
the
sandy
shore
watching
the
waves
that
come
plunging
up
the
beach
like
seahorses
as
thoreau
calls
them
his
eye
follows
the
lessening
sail
as
it
fades
into
the
blue
horizon
and
he
burns
for
the
time
when
he
shall
stand
on
the
of
his
own
ship
and
go
sailing
proudly
across
that
mysterious
waste
of
waters
then
the
town
itself
is
full
of
hints
and
flavors
of
the
sea
the
gables
and
roofs
of
the
houses
facing
eastward
are
covered
with
red
rust
like
the
flukes
of
old
anchors
a
salty
smell
pervades
the
air
and
dense
gray
fogs
the
very
breath
of
ocean
periodically
creep
up
into
the
quiet
streets
and
envelop
everything
the
terrific
storms
that
lash
the
coast
the
kelp
and
spars
and
sometimes
the
bodies
of
drowned
men
tossed
on
shore
by
the
scornful
waves
the
shipyards
the
wharves
and
the
tawny
fleet
of
yearly
fitted
out
at
rivermouth
these
things
and
a
hundred
other
feed
the
imagination
and
fill
the
brain
of
every
healthy
boy
with
dreams
of
adventure
he
learns
to
swim
almost
as
soon
as
he
can
walk
he
draws
in
with
his
mother
milk
the
art
of
handling
an
oar
he
is
born
a
sailor
whatever
he
may
turn
out
to
be
afterwards
to
own
the
whole
or
a
portion
of
a
is
his
earliest
ambition
no
wonder
that
i
born
to
this
life
and
coming
back
to
it
with
freshest
sympathies
should
have
caught
the
prevailing
infection
no
wonder
i
longed
to
buy
a
part
of
the
trim
little
sailboat
dolphin
which
chanced
just
then
to
be
in
the
market
this
was
in
the
latter
part
of
may
three
shares
at
five
or
six
dollars
each
i
forget
which
had
already
been
taken
by
phil
adams
fred
langdon
and
binny
wallace
the
fourth
and
remaining
share
hung
fire
unless
a
purchaser
could
be
found
for
this
the
bargain
was
to
fall
through
i
am
afraid
i
required
but
slight
urging
to
join
in
the
investment
i
had
four
dollars
and
fifty
cents
on
hand
and
the
treasurer
of
the
centipedes
advanced
me
the
balance
receiving
my
silver
as
ample
security
it
was
a
proud
moment
when
i
stood
on
the
wharf
with
my
partners
inspecting
the
dolphin
moored
at
the
foot
of
a
very
slippery
flight
of
steps
she
was
painted
white
with
a
green
stripe
outside
and
on
the
stern
a
yellow
dolphin
with
its
scarlet
mouth
wide
open
stared
with
a
surprised
expression
at
its
own
reflection
in
the
water
the
boat
was
a
great
bargain
i
whirled
my
cap
in
the
air
and
ran
to
the
stairs
leading
down
from
the
wharf
when
a
hand
was
laid
gently
on
my
shoulder
i
turned
and
faced
captain
nutter
i
never
saw
such
an
old
as
he
was
in
those
days
i
knew
he
would
be
angry
with
me
for
buying
a
rowboat
but
i
also
knew
that
the
little
bowsprit
suggesting
a
jib
and
the
tapering
mast
ready
for
its
few
square
feet
of
canvas
were
trifles
not
likely
to
meet
his
approval
as
far
as
rowing
on
the
river
among
the
wharves
was
concerned
the
captain
had
long
since
withdrawn
his
decided
objections
having
convinced
himself
by
going
out
with
me
several
times
that
i
could
manage
a
pair
of
sculls
as
well
as
anybody
i
was
right
in
my
surmises
he
commanded
me
in
the
most
emphatic
terms
never
to
go
out
in
the
dolphin
without
leaving
the
mast
in
the
this
curtailed
my
anticipated
sport
but
the
pleasure
of
having
a
pull
whenever
i
wanted
it
remained
i
never
disobeyed
the
captain
orders
touching
the
sail
though
i
sometimes
extended
my
row
beyond
the
points
he
had
indicated
the
river
was
dangerous
for
sailboats
squalls
without
the
slightest
warning
were
of
frequent
occurrence
scarcely
a
year
passed
that
six
or
seven
persons
were
not
drowned
under
the
very
windows
of
the
town
and
these
oddly
enough
were
generally
who
either
did
not
understand
the
river
or
lacked
the
skill
to
handle
a
small
craft
a
knowledge
of
such
disasters
one
of
which
i
witnessed
consoled
me
somewhat
when
i
saw
phil
adams
skimming
over
the
water
in
a
spanking
breeze
with
every
stitch
of
canvas
set
there
were
few
better
yachtsmen
than
phil
adams
he
usually
went
sailing
alone
for
both
fred
langdon
and
binny
wallace
were
under
the
same
restrictions
i
was
not
long
after
the
purchase
of
the
boat
we
planned
an
excursion
to
sandpeep
island
the
last
of
the
islands
in
the
harbor
we
proposed
to
start
early
in
the
morning
and
return
with
the
tide
in
the
moonlight
our
only
difficulty
was
to
obtain
a
whole
day
exemption
from
school
the
customary
not
being
long
enough
for
our
picnic
somehow
we
could
work
it
but
fortune
arranged
it
for
us
i
may
say
here
that
whatever
else
i
did
i
never
played
truant
hookey
we
called
it
in
my
life
one
afternoon
the
four
owners
of
the
dolphin
exchanged
significant
glances
when
grimshaw
announced
from
the
desk
that
there
would
be
no
school
the
following
day
he
having
just
received
intelligence
of
the
death
of
his
uncle
in
boston
i
was
sincerely
attached
to
grimshaw
but
i
am
afraid
that
the
death
of
his
uncle
did
not
affect
me
as
it
ought
to
have
done
we
were
up
before
sunrise
the
next
morning
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
the
flood
tide
which
waits
for
no
man
our
preparations
for
the
cruise
were
made
the
previous
evening
in
the
way
of
eatables
and
drinkables
we
had
stored
in
the
stem
of
the
dolphin
a
generous
bag
of
for
the
chowder
a
piece
of
pork
to
fry
the
cunners
in
three
gigantic
bought
at
pettingil
half
a
dozen
lemons
and
a
keg
of
the
article
we
slung
over
the
side
to
keep
it
cool
as
soon
as
we
got
under
way
the
crockery
and
the
bricks
for
our
we
placed
in
the
bows
with
the
groceries
which
included
sugar
pepper
salt
and
a
bottle
of
pickles
phil
adams
contributed
to
the
outfit
a
small
tent
of
unbleached
cotton
cloth
under
which
we
intended
to
take
our
nooning
we
unshipped
the
mast
threw
in
an
extra
oar
and
were
ready
to
embark
i
do
not
believe
that
christopher
columbus
when
he
started
on
his
rather
successful
voyage
of
discovery
felt
half
the
responsibility
and
importance
that
weighed
upon
me
as
i
sat
on
the
middle
seat
of
the
dolphin
with
my
oar
resting
in
the
i
wonder
if
christopher
columbus
quietly
slipped
out
of
the
house
without
letting
his
estimable
family
know
what
he
was
up
to
charley
marden
whose
father
had
promised
to
cane
him
if
he
ever
stepped
foot
on
sail
or
rowboat
came
down
to
the
wharf
in
a
humor
to
see
us
off
nothing
would
tempt
him
to
go
out
on
the
river
in
such
a
crazy
of
a
boat
he
pretended
that
he
did
not
expect
to
behold
us
alive
again
and
tried
to
throw
a
wet
blanket
over
the
expedition
guess
you
have
a
squally
time
of
it
said
charley
casting
off
the
painter
i
drop
in
at
old
newbury
newbury
was
the
parish
undertaker
and
leave
word
as
i
go
along
bosh
muttered
phil
adams
sticking
the
into
the
of
the
wharf
and
sending
the
dolphin
half
a
dozen
yards
towards
the
current
how
calm
and
lovely
the
river
was
not
a
ripple
stirred
on
the
glassy
surface
broken
only
by
the
sharp
cutwater
of
our
tiny
craft
the
sun
as
round
and
red
as
an
august
moon
was
by
this
time
peering
above
the
the
town
had
drifted
behind
us
and
we
were
entering
among
the
group
of
islands
sometimes
we
could
almost
touch
with
our
the
shelving
banks
on
either
side
as
we
neared
the
mouth
of
the
harbor
a
little
breeze
now
and
then
wrinkled
the
blue
water
shook
the
spangles
from
the
foliage
and
gently
lifted
the
spiral
that
still
clung
along
shore
the
measured
dip
of
our
oars
and
the
drowsy
twitterings
of
the
birds
seemed
to
mingle
with
rather
than
break
the
enchanted
silence
that
reigned
about
us
the
scent
of
the
new
clover
comes
back
to
me
now
as
i
recall
that
delicious
morning
when
we
floated
away
in
a
fairy
boat
down
a
river
like
a
dream
the
sun
was
well
up
when
the
nose
of
the
dolphin
nestled
against
the
bosom
of
sandpeep
island
this
island
as
i
have
said
before
was
the
last
of
the
cluster
one
side
of
it
being
washed
by
the
sea
we
landed
on
the
the
sloping
sands
and
quiet
water
affording
us
a
good
place
to
moor
the
boat
it
took
us
an
hour
or
two
to
transport
our
stores
to
the
spot
selected
for
the
encampment
having
pitched
our
tent
using
the
five
oars
to
support
the
canvas
we
got
out
our
lines
and
went
down
the
rocks
seaward
to
fish
it
was
early
for
cunners
but
we
were
lucky
enough
to
catch
as
nice
a
mess
as
ever
you
saw
a
cod
for
the
chowder
was
not
so
easily
secured
at
last
binny
wallace
hauled
in
a
plump
little
fellow
crusted
all
over
with
flaky
silver
to
skin
the
fish
build
our
fireplace
and
cook
the
chowder
kept
us
busy
the
next
two
hours
the
fresh
air
and
the
exercise
had
given
us
the
appetites
of
wolves
and
we
were
about
famished
by
the
time
the
savory
mixture
was
ready
for
our
clamshell
saucers
i
shall
not
insult
the
rising
generation
on
the
seaboard
by
telling
them
how
delectable
is
a
chowder
compounded
and
eaten
in
this
robinson
crusoe
fashion
as
for
the
boys
who
live
inland
and
know
naught
of
such
marine
feasts
my
heart
is
full
of
pity
for
them
what
wasted
lives
not
to
know
the
delights
of
a
not
to
love
chowder
to
be
ignorant
of
how
happy
we
were
we
four
sitting
crosslegged
in
the
crisp
salt
grass
with
the
invigorating
blowing
gratefully
through
our
hair
what
a
joyous
thing
was
life
and
how
far
off
seemed
death
death
that
lurks
in
all
pleasant
places
and
was
so
near
the
banquet
finished
phil
adams
drew
from
his
pocket
a
handful
of
cigars
but
as
none
of
the
party
could
indulge
without
imminent
risk
of
becoming
sick
we
all
on
one
pretext
or
another
declined
and
phil
smoked
by
himself
the
wind
had
freshened
by
this
and
we
found
it
comfortable
to
put
on
the
jackets
which
had
been
thrown
aside
in
the
heat
of
the
day
we
strolled
along
the
beach
and
gathered
large
quantities
of
the
iceland
moss
which
at
certain
seasons
is
washed
to
these
shores
then
we
played
at
ducks
and
drakes
and
then
the
sun
being
sufficiently
low
we
went
in
bathing
before
our
bath
was
ended
a
slight
change
had
come
over
the
sky
and
sea
clouds
scudded
here
and
there
and
a
muffled
moan
from
the
breakers
caught
our
ears
from
time
to
time
while
we
were
dressing
a
few
hurried
drops
of
rain
came
lisping
down
and
we
adjourned
to
the
tent
to
await
the
passing
of
the
squall
we
all
right
anyhow
said
phil
adams
it
wo
be
much
of
a
blow
and
we
be
as
snug
as
a
bug
in
a
rug
here
in
the
tent
particularly
if
we
have
that
lemonade
which
some
of
you
fellows
were
going
to
by
an
oversight
the
lemons
had
been
left
in
the
boat
binny
wallace
volunteered
to
go
for
them
put
an
extra
stone
on
the
painter
binny
said
adams
calling
after
him
it
would
be
awkward
to
have
the
dolphin
give
us
the
slip
and
return
to
port
minus
her
that
it
would
answered
binny
scrambling
down
the
rocks
sandpeep
island
is
one
point
running
out
into
the
sea
and
the
other
looking
towards
the
town
our
tent
was
on
the
though
the
dolphin
was
also
on
the
same
side
it
lay
out
of
sight
by
the
beach
at
the
farther
extremity
of
the
island
binny
wallace
had
been
absent
five
or
six
minutes
when
we
heard
him
calling
our
several
names
in
tones
that
indicated
distress
or
surprise
we
could
not
tell
which
our
first
thought
was
the
boat
has
broken
adrift
we
sprung
to
our
feet
and
hastened
down
to
the
beach
on
turning
the
bluff
which
hid
the
from
our
view
we
found
the
conjecture
correct
not
only
was
the
dolphin
afloat
but
poor
little
binny
wallace
was
standing
in
the
bows
with
his
arms
stretched
helplessly
towards
us
drifting
out
to
sea
head
the
boat
in
shore
shouted
phil
adams
wallace
ran
to
the
tiller
but
the
slight
merely
swung
round
and
drifted
broadside
on
o
if
we
had
but
left
a
single
scull
in
the
dolphin
can
you
swim
it
cried
adams
desperately
using
his
hand
as
a
for
the
distance
between
the
boat
and
the
island
widened
momentarily
binny
wallace
looked
down
at
the
sea
which
was
covered
with
white
caps
and
made
a
despairing
gesture
he
knew
and
we
knew
that
the
stoutest
swimmer
could
not
live
forty
seconds
in
those
angry
waters
a
wild
insane
light
came
into
phil
adams
eyes
as
he
stood
in
the
boiling
surf
and
for
an
instant
i
think
he
meditated
plunging
into
the
ocean
after
the
receding
boat
the
sky
darkened
and
an
ugly
look
stole
rapidly
over
the
broken
surface
of
the
sea
binny
wallace
half
rose
from
his
seat
in
the
stem
and
waved
his
hand
to
us
in
token
of
farewell
in
spite
of
the
distance
increasing
every
instant
we
could
see
his
face
plainly
the
anxious
expression
it
wore
at
first
had
passed
it
was
pale
and
meek
now
and
i
love
to
think
there
was
a
kind
of
halo
about
it
like
that
which
painters
place
around
the
forehead
of
a
saint
so
he
drifted
away
the
sky
grew
darker
and
darker
it
was
only
by
straining
our
eyes
through
the
unnatural
twilight
that
we
could
keep
the
dolphin
in
sight
the
figure
of
binny
wallace
was
no
longer
visible
for
the
boat
itself
had
dwindled
to
a
mere
white
dot
on
the
black
water
now
we
lost
it
and
our
hearts
stopped
throbbing
and
now
the
speck
appeared
again
for
an
instant
on
the
crest
of
a
high
wave
finally
it
went
out
like
a
spark
and
we
saw
it
no
more
then
we
gazed
at
each
other
and
dared
not
speak
absorbed
in
following
the
course
of
the
boat
we
had
scarcely
noticed
the
huddled
inky
clouds
that
sagged
down
all
around
us
from
these
threatening
masses
seamed
at
intervals
with
pale
lightning
there
now
burst
a
heavy
peal
of
thunder
that
shook
the
ground
under
our
feet
a
sudden
squall
struck
the
sea
ploughing
deep
white
furrows
into
it
and
at
the
same
instant
a
single
piercing
shriek
rose
above
the
tempest
the
frightened
cry
of
a
gull
swooping
over
the
island
how
it
startled
us
it
was
impossible
any
longer
to
keep
our
footing
on
the
beach
the
wind
and
the
breakers
would
have
swept
us
into
the
ocean
if
we
had
not
clung
to
each
other
with
the
desperation
of
drowning
men
taking
advantage
of
a
momentary
lull
we
crawled
up
the
sands
on
our
hands
and
knees
and
pausing
in
the
lee
of
the
granite
ledge
to
gain
breath
returned
to
the
camp
where
we
found
that
the
gale
had
snapped
all
the
fastenings
of
the
tent
but
one
held
by
this
the
canvas
swayed
in
the
wind
like
a
balloon
it
was
a
task
of
some
difficulty
to
secure
it
which
we
did
by
beating
down
the
canvas
with
the
oars
after
several
trials
we
succeeded
in
setting
up
the
tent
on
the
leeward
side
of
the
ledge
blinded
by
the
vivid
flashes
of
lightning
and
drenched
by
the
rain
which
fell
in
torrents
we
crept
half
dead
with
fear
and
anguish
under
our
flimsy
shelter
neither
the
anguish
nor
the
fear
was
on
our
own
account
for
we
were
comparatively
safe
but
for
poor
little
binny
wallace
driven
out
to
sea
in
the
merciless
gale
we
shuddered
to
think
of
him
in
that
frail
shell
drifting
on
and
on
to
his
grave
the
sky
rent
with
lightning
over
his
head
and
the
green
abysses
yawning
beneath
him
we
fell
to
crying
the
three
of
us
and
cried
i
know
not
how
long
meanwhile
the
storm
raged
with
augmented
fury
we
were
obliged
to
hold
on
to
the
ropes
of
the
tent
to
prevent
it
blowing
away
the
spray
from
the
river
leaped
several
yards
up
the
rocks
and
clutched
at
us
malignantly
the
very
island
trembled
with
the
concussions
of
the
sea
beating
upon
it
and
at
times
i
fancied
that
it
had
broken
loose
from
its
foundation
and
was
floating
off
with
us
the
breakers
streaked
with
angry
phosphorus
were
fearful
to
look
at
the
wind
rose
higher
and
higher
cutting
long
slits
in
the
tent
through
which
the
rain
poured
incessantly
to
complete
the
sum
of
our
miseries
the
night
was
at
hand
it
came
down
suddenly
at
last
like
a
curtain
shutting
in
sandpeep
island
from
all
the
world
it
was
a
dirty
night
as
the
sailors
say
the
darkness
was
something
that
could
be
felt
as
well
as
seen
it
pressed
down
upon
one
with
a
cold
clammy
touch
gazing
into
the
hollow
blackness
all
sorts
of
imaginable
shapes
seemed
to
start
forth
from
vacancy
brilliant
colors
stars
prisms
and
dancing
lights
what
boy
lying
awake
at
night
has
not
amused
or
terrified
himself
by
peopling
the
spaces
around
his
bed
with
these
phenomena
of
his
own
eyes
i
say
whispered
fred
langdon
at
length
clutching
my
hand
you
see
things
out
there
in
the
dark
yes
yes
binny
wallace
face
i
added
to
my
own
nervousness
by
making
this
avowal
though
for
the
last
ten
minutes
i
had
seen
little
besides
that
face
with
its
angelic
hair
and
brows
first
a
slim
yellow
circle
like
the
nimbus
round
the
moon
took
shape
and
grew
sharp
against
the
darkness
then
this
faded
gradually
and
there
was
the
face
wearing
the
same
sad
sweet
look
it
wore
when
he
waved
his
hand
to
us
across
the
awful
water
this
optical
illusion
kept
repeating
itself
and
i
too
said
adams
i
see
it
every
now
and
then
outside
there
what
would
i
give
if
it
really
was
poor
little
wallace
looking
in
at
us
o
boys
how
shall
we
dare
to
go
back
to
the
town
without
him
wished
a
hundred
times
since
we
been
sitting
here
that
i
was
in
his
place
alive
or
dead
we
dreaded
the
approach
of
morning
as
much
as
we
longed
for
it
the
morning
would
tell
us
all
was
it
possible
for
the
dolphin
to
outride
such
a
storm
there
was
a
on
mackerel
reef
which
lay
directly
in
the
course
the
boat
had
taken
when
it
disappeared
if
the
dolphin
had
caught
on
this
reef
perhaps
binny
wallace
was
safe
perhaps
his
cries
had
been
heard
by
the
keeper
of
the
light
the
man
owned
a
lifeboat
and
had
rescued
several
people
who
could
tell
such
were
the
questions
we
asked
ourselves
again
and
again
as
we
lay
in
each
other
arms
waiting
for
daybreak
what
an
endless
night
it
was
i
have
known
months
that
did
not
seem
so
long
our
position
was
irksome
rather
than
perilous
for
the
day
was
certain
to
bring
us
relief
from
the
town
where
our
prolonged
absence
together
with
the
storm
had
no
doubt
excited
the
liveliest
alarm
for
our
safety
but
the
cold
the
darkness
and
the
suspense
were
hard
to
bear
our
soaked
jackets
had
chilled
us
to
the
bone
to
keep
warm
we
lay
huddled
together
so
closely
that
we
could
bear
our
hearts
beat
above
the
tumult
of
sea
and
sky
after
a
while
we
grew
very
hungry
not
having
broken
our
fast
since
early
in
the
day
the
rain
had
turned
the
into
a
sort
of
dough
but
it
was
better
than
nothing
we
used
to
laugh
at
fred
langdon
for
always
carrying
in
his
pocket
a
small
vial
of
essence
of
peppermint
or
sassafras
a
few
drops
of
which
sprinkled
on
a
lump
of
he
seemed
to
consider
a
great
luxury
i
do
know
what
would
have
become
of
us
at
this
crisis
if
it
been
for
that
omnipresent
bottle
of
hot
stuff
we
poured
the
stinging
liquid
over
our
sugar
which
had
kept
dry
in
a
and
warmed
ourselves
with
frequent
doses
after
four
or
five
hours
the
rain
ceased
the
wind
died
away
to
a
moan
and
the
sea
no
longer
raging
like
a
maniac
sobbed
and
sobbed
with
a
piteous
human
voice
all
along
the
coast
and
well
it
might
after
that
night
work
twelve
sail
of
the
gloucester
fishing
fleet
had
gone
down
with
every
soul
on
board
just
outside
of
light
think
of
the
wide
grief
that
follows
in
the
wake
of
one
wreck
then
think
of
the
despairing
women
who
wrung
their
hands
and
wept
the
next
morning
in
the
streets
of
gloucester
marblehead
and
newcastle
though
our
strength
was
nearly
spent
we
were
too
cold
to
sleep
once
i
sunk
into
a
troubled
doze
when
i
seemed
to
bear
charley
parting
words
only
it
was
the
sea
that
said
them
after
that
i
threw
off
the
drowsiness
whenever
it
threatened
to
overcome
me
fred
langdon
was
the
earliest
to
discover
a
filmy
luminous
streak
in
the
sky
the
first
glimmering
of
sunrise
look
it
is
nearly
daybreak
while
we
were
following
the
direction
of
his
finger
a
sound
of
distant
oars
fell
on
our
ears
we
listened
breathlessly
and
as
the
dip
of
the
blades
became
more
audible
we
discerned
two
foggy
lights
like
floating
on
the
river
running
down
to
the
water
edge
we
hailed
the
boats
with
all
our
might
the
call
was
heard
for
the
oars
rested
a
moment
in
the
and
then
pulled
in
towards
the
island
it
was
two
boats
from
the
town
in
the
foremost
of
which
we
could
now
make
out
the
figures
of
captain
nutter
and
binny
wallace
father
we
shrunk
back
on
seeing
him
thank
god
cried
wallace
fervently
as
he
leaped
from
the
wherry
without
waiting
for
the
bow
to
touch
the
beach
but
when
he
saw
only
three
boys
standing
on
the
sands
his
eye
wandered
restlessly
about
in
quest
of
the
fourth
then
a
deadly
pallor
overspread
his
features
our
story
was
soon
told
a
solemn
silence
fell
upon
the
crowd
of
rough
boatmen
gathered
round
interrupted
only
by
a
stifled
sob
from
one
poor
old
man
who
stood
apart
from
the
rest
the
sea
was
still
running
too
high
for
any
small
boat
to
venture
out
so
it
was
arranged
that
the
wherry
should
take
us
back
to
town
leaving
the
yawl
with
a
picked
crew
to
hug
the
island
until
daybreak
and
then
set
forth
in
search
of
the
dolphin
though
it
was
barely
sunrise
when
we
reached
town
there
were
a
great
many
people
assembled
at
the
landing
eager
for
intelligence
from
missing
boats
two
picnic
parties
had
started
down
river
the
day
before
just
previous
to
the
gale
and
nothing
had
been
beard
of
them
it
turned
out
that
the
saw
their
danger
in
time
and
ran
ashore
on
one
of
the
least
exposed
islands
where
they
passed
the
night
shortly
after
our
own
arrival
they
appeared
off
rivermouth
much
to
the
joy
of
their
friends
in
two
shattered
dismasted
boats
the
excitement
over
i
was
in
a
forlorn
state
physically
and
mentally
captain
nutter
put
me
to
bed
between
hot
blankets
and
sent
kitty
collins
for
the
doctor
i
was
wandering
in
my
mind
and
fancied
myself
still
on
sandpeep
island
now
we
were
building
our
to
cook
the
chowder
and
in
my
delirium
i
laughed
aloud
and
shouted
to
my
comrades
now
the
sky
darkened
and
the
squall
struck
the
island
now
i
gave
orders
to
wallace
how
to
manage
the
boat
and
now
i
cried
because
the
rain
was
pouring
in
on
me
through
the
holes
in
the
tent
towards
evening
a
high
fever
set
in
and
it
was
many
days
before
my
grandfather
deemed
it
prudent
to
tell
me
that
the
dolphin
had
been
found
floating
keel
upwards
four
miles
southeast
of
mackerel
reef
poor
little
binny
wallace
how
strange
it
seemed
when
i
went
to
school
again
to
see
that
empty
seat
in
the
fifth
row
how
gloomy
the
playground
was
lacking
the
sunshine
of
his
gentle
sensitive
face
one
day
a
folded
sheet
slipped
from
my
algebra
it
was
the
last
note
he
ever
wrote
me
i
could
read
it
for
the
tears
what
a
pang
shot
across
my
heart
the
afternoon
it
was
whispered
through
the
town
that
a
body
had
been
washed
ashore
at
grave
point
the
place
where
we
bathed
we
bathed
there
no
more
how
well
i
remember
the
funeral
and
what
a
piteous
sight
it
was
afterwards
to
see
his
familiar
name
on
a
small
headstone
in
the
old
south
burying
ground
poor
little
binny
wallace
always
the
same
to
me
the
rest
of
us
have
grown
up
into
hard
worldly
men
fighting
the
fight
of
life
but
you
are
forever
young
and
gentle
and
pure
a
part
of
my
own
childhood
that
time
can
not
wither
always
a
little
boy
always
poor
little
binny
wallace
chapter
fifteen
an
old
acquaintance
turns
up
a
year
had
stolen
by
since
the
death
of
binny
wallace
a
year
of
which
i
have
nothing
important
to
record
the
loss
of
our
little
playmate
threw
a
shadow
over
our
young
lives
for
many
and
many
a
month
the
dolphin
rose
and
fell
with
the
tide
at
the
foot
of
the
slippery
steps
unused
the
rest
of
the
summer
at
the
close
of
november
we
hauled
her
sadly
into
the
for
the
winter
but
when
spring
came
round
we
launched
the
dolphin
again
and
often
went
down
to
the
wharf
and
looked
at
her
lying
in
the
tangled
without
much
inclination
to
take
a
row
the
associations
connected
with
the
boat
were
too
painful
as
yet
but
time
which
wears
the
sharp
edge
from
everything
softened
this
feeling
and
one
afternoon
we
brought
out
the
cobwebbed
oars
the
ice
once
broken
brief
trips
along
the
wharves
we
seldom
cared
to
go
out
into
the
river
now
became
one
of
our
chief
amusements
meanwhile
gypsy
was
not
forgotten
every
clear
morning
i
was
in
the
saddle
before
breakfast
and
there
are
few
roads
or
lanes
within
ten
miles
of
rivermouth
that
have
not
borne
the
print
of
her
vagrant
hoof
i
studied
like
a
good
fellow
this
quarter
carrying
off
a
couple
of
first
prizes
the
captain
expressed
his
gratification
by
presenting
me
with
a
new
silver
dollar
if
a
dollar
in
his
eyes
was
smaller
than
a
it
was
so
very
much
smaller
i
redeemed
my
from
the
treasurer
of
the
centipedes
and
felt
that
i
was
getting
on
in
the
world
it
was
at
this
time
i
was
greatly
cast
down
by
a
letter
from
my
father
saying
that
he
should
be
unable
to
visit
rivermouth
until
the
following
year
with
that
letter
came
another
to
captain
nutter
which
he
did
not
read
aloud
to
the
family
as
usual
it
was
on
business
he
said
folding
it
up
in
his
wallet
he
received
several
of
these
business
letters
from
time
to
time
and
i
noticed
that
they
always
made
him
silent
and
moody
the
fact
is
my
father
was
not
thriving
the
failure
of
a
firm
largely
indebted
to
him
had
crippled
the
when
the
captain
imparted
this
information
to
me
i
trouble
myself
over
the
matter
i
supposed
if
i
supposed
anything
that
all
people
had
more
or
less
money
when
they
wanted
it
whether
they
inherited
it
or
whether
government
supplied
them
was
not
clear
to
me
a
loose
idea
that
my
father
had
a
private
somewhere
or
other
relieved
me
of
all
uneasiness
i
was
not
far
from
right
every
man
has
within
himself
a
whose
riches
are
limited
only
by
his
own
industry
it
is
true
it
sometimes
happens
that
industry
does
not
avail
if
a
man
lacks
that
something
which
for
want
of
a
better
name
we
call
luck
my
father
was
a
person
of
untiring
energy
and
ability
but
he
had
no
luck
to
use
a
rivermouth
saying
he
was
always
catching
sculpins
when
everyone
else
with
the
same
bait
was
catching
mackerel
it
was
more
than
two
years
since
i
had
seen
my
parents
i
felt
that
i
could
not
bear
a
longer
separation
every
letter
from
new
orleans
we
got
two
or
three
a
month
gave
me
a
fit
of
homesickness
and
when
it
was
definitely
settled
that
my
father
and
mother
were
to
remain
in
the
south
another
twelvemonth
i
resolved
to
go
to
them
since
binny
wallace
death
pepper
whitcomb
had
been
my
fidus
achates
we
occupied
desks
near
each
other
at
school
and
were
always
together
in
play
hours
we
rigged
a
twine
telegraph
from
his
garret
window
to
the
scuttle
of
the
nutter
house
and
sent
messages
to
each
other
in
a
we
shared
our
and
our
secrets
those
amazing
secrets
which
boys
have
we
met
in
lonely
places
by
stealth
and
parted
like
conspirators
we
could
buy
a
jackknife
or
build
a
kite
without
throwing
an
air
of
mystery
and
guilt
over
the
transaction
i
naturally
hastened
to
lay
my
new
orleans
project
before
pepper
whitcomb
having
dragged
him
for
that
purpose
to
a
secluded
spot
in
the
dark
pine
woods
outside
the
town
pepper
listened
to
me
with
a
gravity
which
he
will
not
be
able
to
surpass
when
he
becomes
chief
justice
and
strongly
advised
me
to
go
the
summer
vacation
said
pepper
lasts
six
weeks
that
will
give
you
a
fortnight
to
spend
in
new
orleans
allowing
two
weeks
each
way
for
the
i
wrung
his
hand
and
begged
him
to
accompany
me
offering
to
defray
all
the
expenses
i
was
anything
if
i
was
princely
in
those
days
after
considerable
urging
he
consented
to
go
on
terms
so
liberal
the
whole
thing
was
arranged
there
was
nothing
to
do
now
but
to
advise
captain
nutter
of
my
plan
which
i
did
the
next
day
the
possibility
that
he
might
oppose
the
tour
never
entered
my
head
i
was
therefore
totally
unprepared
for
the
vigorous
negative
which
met
my
proposal
i
was
deeply
mortified
moreover
for
there
was
pepper
whitcomb
on
the
wharf
at
the
foot
of
the
street
waiting
for
me
to
come
and
let
him
know
what
day
we
were
to
start
go
to
new
orleans
go
to
jericho
exclaimed
captain
nutter
look
pretty
you
two
philandering
off
like
the
babes
in
the
wood
hundred
miles
all
the
world
before
you
where
to
choose
and
the
captain
features
which
had
worn
an
indignant
air
as
he
began
the
sentence
relaxed
into
a
broad
smile
whether
it
was
at
the
felicity
of
his
own
quotation
or
at
the
mental
picture
he
drew
of
pepper
and
myself
on
our
travels
i
could
tell
and
i
did
care
i
was
how
could
i
face
my
chum
after
all
the
dazzling
inducements
i
had
held
out
to
him
my
grandfather
seeing
that
i
took
the
matter
seriously
pointed
out
the
difficulties
of
such
a
journey
and
the
great
expense
involved
he
entered
into
the
details
of
my
father
money
troubles
and
succeeded
in
making
it
plain
to
me
that
my
wishes
under
the
circumstances
were
somewhat
unreasonable
it
was
in
no
cheerful
mood
that
i
joined
pepper
at
the
end
of
the
wharf
i
found
that
young
gentleman
leaning
against
the
bulkhead
gazing
intently
towards
the
islands
in
the
harbor
he
had
formed
a
telescope
of
his
hands
and
was
so
occupied
with
his
observations
as
to
be
oblivious
of
my
approach
hullo
cried
pepper
dropping
his
hands
look
there
is
that
a
bark
coming
up
the
narrows
where
just
at
the
left
of
fishcrate
island
do
you
see
the
foremast
peeping
above
the
old
derrick
sure
enough
it
was
a
vessel
of
considerable
size
slowly
beating
up
to
town
in
a
few
moments
more
the
other
two
masts
were
visible
above
the
green
hillocks
blown
away
said
pepper
putting
in
for
repairs
i
as
the
bark
lazily
crept
from
behind
the
last
of
the
islands
she
let
go
her
anchors
and
swung
round
with
the
tide
then
the
gleeful
chant
of
the
sailors
at
the
capstan
came
to
us
pleasantly
across
the
water
the
vessel
lay
within
three
quarters
of
a
mile
of
us
and
we
could
plainly
see
the
men
at
the
davits
lowering
the
starboard
it
no
sooner
touched
the
stream
than
a
dozen
of
the
crew
scrambled
like
mice
over
the
side
of
the
merchantman
in
a
neglected
seaport
like
rivermouth
the
arrival
of
a
large
ship
is
an
event
of
moment
the
prospect
of
having
twenty
or
thirty
jolly
tars
let
loose
on
the
peaceful
town
excites
divers
emotions
among
the
inhabitants
the
small
shopkeepers
along
the
wharves
anticipate
a
thriving
trade
the
proprietors
of
the
two
rival
the
wee
drop
and
the
mariner
home
hasten
down
to
the
landing
to
secure
lodgers
and
the
female
population
of
anchor
lane
turn
out
to
a
woman
for
a
ship
fresh
from
sea
is
always
full
of
possible
husbands
and
prodigal
sons
but
aside
from
this
there
is
scant
welcome
given
to
a
ship
crew
in
rivermouth
the
mariner
is
a
sad
fellow
ashore
judging
him
by
a
severe
moral
standard
once
i
remember
a
united
states
frigate
came
into
port
for
repairs
after
a
storm
she
lay
in
the
river
a
fortnight
or
more
and
every
day
sent
us
a
gang
of
sixty
or
seventy
of
our
country
gallant
defenders
who
spread
themselves
over
the
town
doing
all
sorts
of
mad
things
they
were
enough
but
full
of
old
sancho
the
wee
drop
proved
a
drop
too
much
for
many
of
them
they
went
singing
through
the
streets
at
midnight
wringing
off
shinning
up
and
frightening
the
oldest
inhabitant
nearly
to
death
by
popping
their
heads
into
his
window
and
shouting
fire
one
morning
a
was
discovered
in
a
perilous
plight
up
the
steeple
of
the
south
church
clinging
to
the
how
he
got
there
nobody
could
tell
not
even
himself
all
he
knew
was
that
the
leg
of
his
trousers
had
caught
on
a
nail
and
there
he
stuck
unable
to
move
either
way
it
cost
the
town
twenty
dollars
to
get
him
down
again
he
directed
the
workmen
how
to
splice
the
ladders
brought
to
his
assistance
and
called
his
rescuers
with
delicious
coolness
but
those
were
men
the
craft
now
lying
off
fishcrate
island
was
likely
to
carry
any
such
cargo
nevertheless
we
watched
the
coming
in
of
the
with
considerable
interest
as
it
drew
near
the
figure
of
the
man
pulling
the
seemed
oddly
familiar
to
me
where
could
i
have
seen
him
before
when
and
where
his
back
was
towards
me
but
there
was
something
about
that
closely
cropped
head
that
i
recognized
instantly
way
enough
cried
the
steersman
and
all
the
oars
stood
upright
in
the
air
the
man
in
the
bow
seized
the
and
turning
round
quickly
showed
me
the
honest
face
of
sailor
ben
of
the
typhoon
it
sailor
ben
i
cried
nearly
pushing
pepper
whitcomb
overboard
in
my
excitement
sailor
ben
with
the
wonderful
pink
lady
on
his
arm
and
the
ships
and
stars
and
anchors
tattooed
all
over
him
was
a
hero
among
my
playmates
and
there
he
was
like
something
in
a
dream
come
true
i
did
wait
for
my
old
acquaintance
to
get
firmly
on
the
wharf
before
i
grasped
his
hand
in
both
of
mine
sailor
ben
do
you
remember
me
he
evidently
did
not
he
shifted
his
quid
from
one
cheek
to
the
other
and
looked
at
me
meditatively
lord
love
ye
lad
i
do
know
you
i
was
never
here
afore
in
my
what
i
cried
enjoying
his
perplexity
have
you
forgotten
the
voyage
from
new
orleans
in
the
typhoon
two
years
ago
you
lovely
old
ah
then
he
knew
me
and
in
token
of
the
recollection
gave
my
hand
such
a
squeeze
that
i
am
sure
an
unpleasant
change
came
over
my
countenance
bless
my
eyes
but
you
have
growed
so
i
should
have
knowed
you
if
i
had
met
you
in
singapore
without
stopping
to
inquire
as
i
was
tempted
to
do
why
he
was
more
likely
to
recognize
me
in
singapore
than
anywhere
else
i
invited
him
to
come
at
once
up
to
the
nutter
house
where
i
insured
him
a
warm
welcome
from
the
captain
hold
steady
master
tom
said
sailor
ben
slipping
the
painter
through
the
ringbolt
and
tying
the
loveliest
knot
you
ever
saw
hold
steady
till
i
see
if
the
mate
can
let
me
off
if
you
please
sir
he
continued
addressing
the
steersman
a
very
person
this
here
is
a
little
shipmate
o
mine
as
wants
to
talk
over
back
times
along
of
me
if
so
it
all
right
ben
returned
the
mate
want
you
for
an
leaving
one
man
in
charge
of
the
boat
the
mate
and
the
rest
of
the
crew
went
off
together
in
the
meanwhile
pepper
whitcomb
had
got
out
his
and
was
quietly
fishing
at
the
end
of
the
wharf
as
if
to
give
me
the
idea
that
he
was
so
very
much
impressed
by
my
intimacy
with
so
renowned
a
character
as
sailor
ben
perhaps
pepper
was
a
little
jealous
at
any
rate
he
refused
to
go
with
us
to
the
house
captain
nutter
was
at
home
reading
the
rivermouth
barnacle
he
was
a
reader
to
do
an
editor
heart
good
he
never
skipped
over
an
advertisement
even
if
he
had
read
it
fifty
times
before
then
the
paper
went
the
rounds
of
the
neighborhood
among
the
poor
people
like
the
single
portable
eye
which
the
three
blind
crones
passed
to
each
other
in
the
legend
of
king
acrisius
the
captain
i
repeat
was
wandering
in
the
labyrinths
of
the
rivermouth
barnacle
when
i
led
sailor
ben
into
the
my
grandfather
whose
inborn
courtesy
knew
no
distinctions
received
my
nautical
friend
as
if
he
had
been
an
admiral
instead
of
a
common
sailor
ben
pulled
an
imaginary
tuft
of
hair
on
his
forehead
and
bowed
clumsily
sailors
have
a
way
of
using
their
forelock
as
a
sort
of
handle
to
bow
with
the
old
tar
had
probably
never
been
in
so
handsome
an
apartment
in
all
his
days
and
nothing
could
induce
him
to
take
the
inviting
mahogany
chair
which
the
captain
wheeled
out
from
the
corner
the
abashed
mariner
stood
up
against
the
wall
twirling
his
tarpaulin
in
his
two
hands
and
looking
extremely
silly
he
made
a
poor
show
in
a
gentleman
but
what
a
fellow
he
had
been
in
his
day
when
the
gale
blew
great
guns
and
the
topsails
wanted
reefing
i
thought
of
him
with
the
mexican
squadron
off
vera
cruz
where
rushing
sung
from
the
out
of
the
foam
and
he
did
seem
awkward
or
ignoble
to
me
for
all
his
shyness
as
sailor
ben
declined
to
sit
down
the
captain
did
not
resume
his
seat
so
we
three
stood
in
a
constrained
manner
until
my
grandfather
went
to
the
door
and
called
to
kitty
to
bring
in
a
decanter
of
madeira
and
two
glasses
my
grandson
here
has
talked
so
much
about
you
said
the
captain
pleasantly
that
you
seem
quite
like
an
old
acquaintance
to
thankee
sir
thankee
returned
sailor
ben
looking
as
guilty
as
if
he
had
been
detected
in
picking
a
pocket
and
i
very
glad
to
see
you
sailor
ben
suggested
that
worthy
mr
sailor
ben
added
the
captain
smiling
tom
open
the
door
there
kitty
with
the
i
opened
the
door
and
kitty
entered
the
room
bringing
the
things
on
a
waiter
which
she
was
about
to
set
on
the
table
when
suddenly
she
uttered
a
loud
shriek
the
decanter
and
glasses
fell
with
a
crash
to
the
floor
and
kitty
as
white
as
a
sheet
was
seen
flying
through
the
hall
it
his
wraith
it
his
wraith
we
heard
kitty
shrieking
in
the
kitchen
my
grandfather
and
i
turned
with
amazement
to
sailor
ben
his
eyes
were
standing
out
of
his
head
like
a
lobster
it
my
own
little
irish
lass
shouted
the
sailor
and
he
darted
into
the
hall
after
her
even
then
we
scarcely
caught
the
meaning
of
his
words
but
when
we
saw
sailor
ben
and
kitty
sobbing
on
each
other
shoulder
in
the
kitchen
we
understood
it
all
i
begs
your
honor
parden
sir
said
sailor
ben
lifting
his
face
above
kitty
tumbled
hair
i
begs
your
parden
for
kicking
up
a
rumpus
in
the
house
but
it
my
own
little
irish
lass
as
i
lost
so
long
ago
heaven
preserve
us
cried
the
captain
blowing
his
nose
violently
a
transparent
ruse
to
hide
his
emotion
miss
abigail
was
in
an
upper
chamber
sweeping
but
on
hearing
the
unusual
racket
below
she
scented
an
accident
and
came
ambling
downstairs
with
a
bottle
of
the
infallible
in
her
hand
nothing
but
the
firmness
of
my
grandfather
prevented
her
from
giving
sailor
ben
a
on
the
spot
but
when
she
learned
what
had
come
about
that
this
was
kitty
husband
that
kitty
collins
kitty
collins
now
but
benjamin
watson
of
nantucket
the
good
soul
sat
down
on
the
and
sobbed
as
if
to
quote
from
captain
nutter
as
if
a
husband
of
her
own
had
turned
up
a
happier
set
of
people
than
we
were
never
met
together
in
a
dingy
kitchen
or
anywhere
else
the
captain
ordered
a
fresh
decanter
of
madeira
and
made
all
hands
excepting
myself
drink
a
cup
to
the
return
of
the
prodigal
as
he
persisted
in
calling
sailor
ben
after
the
first
flush
of
joy
and
surprise
was
over
kitty
grew
silent
and
constrained
now
and
then
she
fixed
her
eyes
thoughtfully
on
her
husband
why
had
he
deserted
her
all
these
years
what
right
had
he
to
look
for
a
welcome
from
one
he
had
treated
so
cruelly
she
had
been
true
to
him
but
had
he
been
true
to
her
sailor
ben
must
have
guessed
what
was
passing
in
her
mind
for
presently
he
took
her
hand
and
said
well
lass
it
a
long
yarn
but
you
shall
have
it
all
in
good
time
it
was
my
hard
luck
as
made
us
part
company
an
no
will
of
mine
for
i
loved
you
kitty
brightened
up
immediately
needing
no
other
assurance
of
sailor
ben
faithfulness
when
his
hour
had
expired
we
walked
with
him
down
to
the
wharf
where
the
captain
held
a
consultation
with
the
mate
which
resulted
in
an
extension
of
watson
leave
of
absence
and
afterwards
in
his
discharge
from
his
ship
we
then
went
to
the
mariner
home
to
engage
a
room
for
him
as
he
would
hear
of
accepting
the
hospitalities
of
the
nutter
house
you
see
i
only
an
uneddicated
man
he
remarked
to
my
grandfather
by
way
of
explanation
chapter
sixteen
in
which
sailor
ben
spins
a
yarn
of
course
we
were
all
very
curious
to
learn
what
had
befallen
sailor
ben
that
morning
long
ago
when
he
bade
his
little
bride
goodby
and
disappeared
so
mysteriously
after
tea
that
same
evening
we
assembled
around
the
table
in
the
kitchen
the
only
place
where
sailor
ben
felt
at
home
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
for
himself
the
candles
were
snuffed
and
a
pitcher
of
foaming
ale
was
set
at
the
elbow
of
the
speaker
who
was
evidently
embarrassed
by
the
respectability
of
his
audience
consisting
of
captain
nutter
miss
abigail
myself
and
kitty
whose
face
shone
with
happiness
like
one
of
the
polished
tin
platters
on
the
dresser
well
my
hearties
commenced
sailor
ben
then
he
stopped
short
and
turned
very
red
as
it
struck
him
that
maybe
this
was
not
quite
the
proper
way
to
address
a
dignitary
like
the
captain
and
a
severe
elderly
lady
like
miss
abigail
nutter
who
sat
bolt
upright
staring
at
him
as
she
would
have
stared
at
the
tycoon
of
japan
himself
i
ai
much
of
a
hand
at
spinnin
a
yarn
remarked
sailor
ben
apologetically
when
the
yarn
is
all
about
a
man
as
has
made
a
fool
of
hisself
an
when
that
man
name
is
benjamin
bravo
cried
captain
nutter
rapping
on
the
table
encouragingly
thankee
sir
thankee
i
go
back
to
the
time
when
kitty
an
me
was
livin
in
lodgin
by
the
dock
in
new
york
we
was
as
happy
sir
as
two
porpusses
which
they
toil
not
neither
do
they
spin
but
when
i
seed
the
money
gittin
low
in
the
locker
kitty
starboard
stockin
savin
your
presence
marm
i
got
like
seem
as
i
should
be
obleeged
to
ship
agin
for
it
did
seem
as
i
could
do
much
ashore
an
then
the
sea
was
my
spear
of
action
i
was
exactly
born
on
it
look
you
but
i
fell
into
it
the
fust
time
i
was
let
out
arter
my
birth
my
mother
slipped
her
cable
for
a
heavenly
port
afore
i
was
old
enough
to
hail
her
so
i
larnt
to
look
on
the
ocean
for
a
sort
of
a
precious
hard
one
she
has
been
to
me
the
idee
of
leavin
kitty
so
soon
arter
our
marriage
went
agin
my
grain
considerable
i
cruised
along
the
docks
for
somethin
to
do
in
the
way
of
stevedore
an
though
i
picked
up
a
stray
job
here
and
there
i
did
arn
enough
to
buy
for
a
rat
let
alone
feedin
two
human
mouths
there
was
nothin
honest
i
would
have
turned
a
hand
to
but
the
gobbled
up
all
the
work
an
a
outsider
like
me
did
stand
a
show
things
got
from
bad
to
worse
the
month
rent
took
all
our
cash
except
a
dollar
or
so
an
the
sky
looked
kind
o
squally
fore
an
aft
well
i
set
out
one
mornin
that
identical
unlucky
mornin
determined
to
come
back
an
toss
some
pay
into
kitty
lap
if
i
had
to
sell
my
jacket
for
it
i
spied
a
brig
unloadin
coal
at
pier
no
how
well
i
remembers
it
i
hailed
the
mate
an
offered
myself
for
a
but
i
was
wanted
as
he
told
me
civilly
enough
which
was
better
treatment
than
usual
as
i
turned
off
rather
glum
i
was
signalled
by
one
of
them
sleek
rascals
with
a
white
hat
an
a
weed
on
it
as
is
always
goin
about
the
piers
who
they
may
devower
we
sailors
know
for
rascals
from
stem
to
starn
but
somehow
every

on

a
three
years
cruise

my
dear
little
lass

miss

in
a
voice
that
vibrated
among
the
tin
platters
on
the
dresser
this
was
miss
abigail
way
of
testifying
her
sympathy
thankee
marm
returned
sailor
ben
doubtfully
no
talking
to
the
man
at
the
wheel
cried
the
captain
upon
which
we
all
laughed
spin
added
my
grandfather
sailor
ben
resumed
i
leave
you
to
guess
the
wretchedness
as
fell
upon
me
for
i
not
got
the
gift
to
tell
you
there
i
was
down
on
the
ship
books
for
a
three
years
viage
an
no
help
for
it
i
feel
nigh
to
six
hundred
years
old
when
i
think
how
long
that
viage
was
there
is
no
as
runs
slow
enough
to
keep
a
tally
of
the
slowness
of
them
fust
hours
but
i
done
my
duty
like
a
man
seem
there
was
no
way
of
gettin
out
of
it
i
told
my
shipmates
of
the
trick
as
had
been
played
on
me
an
they
tried
to
cheer
me
up
a
bit
but
i
was
sore
sorrowful
for
a
long
spell
many
a
night
on
watch
i
put
my
face
in
my
hands
and
sobbed
for
thinkin
of
the
little
woman
left
among
the
an
no
man
to
have
an
eye
on
her
god
bless
her
here
kitty
softly
drew
her
chair
nearer
to
sailor
ben
and
rested
one
hand
on
his
arm
our
adventures
among
the
whales
i
take
it
does
consarn
the
present
company
here
assembled
so
i
give
that
the
go
by
there
an
end
to
everythin
even
to
a
whalin
viage
my
heart
all
but
choked
me
the
day
we
put
into
new
bedford
with
our
cargo
of
ile
i
got
my
three
years
pay
in
a
lump
an
made
for
new
york
like
a
flash
of
lightnin
the
people
hove
to
and
looked
at
me
as
i
rushed
through
the
streets
like
a
madman
until
i
came
to
the
spot
where
the
stood
on
west
street
but
lord
love
ye
there
was
no
sech
there
but
a
great
new
brick
shop
i
made
bold
to
go
in
an
ask
arter
the
old
place
but
nobody
knowed
nothin
about
it
save
as
it
had
been
torn
down
two
years
or
more
i
was
adrift
now
for
i
had
reckoned
all
them
days
and
nights
on
gittin
word
of
kitty
from
dan
shackford
the
man
as
kept
the
lodgin
as
i
stood
there
with
all
the
wind
knocked
out
of
my
sails
the
idee
of
runnin
alongside
the
popped
into
my
head
the
perlice
was
likely
to
know
the
latitude
of
a
man
like
dan
shackford
who
over
an
above
respecktible
they
did
know
he
had
died
in
the
tombs
jail
that
day
twelvemonth
a
coincydunce
was
it
i
was
ready
to
drop
when
they
told
me
this
howsomever
i
bore
up
an
give
the
chief
a
notion
of
the
fix
i
was
in
he
writ
a
notice
which
i
put
into
the
newspapers
every
day
for
three
months
but
nothin
come
of
it
i
cruised
over
the
city
week
in
and
week
out
i
went
to
every
sort
of
place
where
they
hired
women
hands
i
did
leave
a
think
undone
that
a
uneddicated
man
could
do
but
nothin
come
of
it
i
do
believe
there
was
a
wretcheder
soul
in
that
big
city
of
wretchedness
than
me
sometimes
i
wanted
to
lay
down
in
the
sheets
and
die
driftin
disconsolate
one
day
among
the
shippin
who
should
i
overhaul
but
the
identical
chap
with
a
white
hat
an
a
weed
on
it
i
did
know
if
there
was
any
spent
left
in
me
till
i
clapped
eye
on
his
very
onpleasant
countenance
villain
sez
i
my
little
irish
lass
as
you
dragged
me
away
from
an
i
lighted
on
him
hat
and
all
like
that
here
sailor
ben
brought
his
fist
down
on
the
deal
table
with
the
force
of
a
miss
abigail
gave
a
start
and
the
ale
leaped
up
in
the
pitcher
like
a
miniature
fountain
i
begs
your
parden
ladies
and
gentlemen
all
but
the
thought
of
that
feller
with
his
ring
an
his
an
his
walrus
face
is
alus
too
many
for
me
i
was
for
pitchin
him
into
the
north
river
when
a
perliceman
prevented
me
from
benefitin
the
human
family
i
had
to
pay
five
dollars
for
hittin
the
chap
they
said
it
was
salt
and
buttery
an
that
what
i
call
a
neat
genteel
luxury
it
was
worth
double
the
money
jest
to
see
that
white
hat
with
a
weed
on
it
layin
on
the
wharf
like
a
busted
accordiun
arter
months
of
useless
sarch
i
went
to
sea
agin
i
never
got
into
a
foren
port
but
i
kept
a
watch
out
for
kitty
once
i
thought
i
seed
her
in
liverpool
but
it
was
only
a
gal
as
looked
like
her
the
numbers
of
women
in
different
parts
of
the
world
as
looked
like
her
was
amazin
so
a
good
many
years
crawled
by
an
i
wandered
from
place
to
place
never
givin
up
the
sarch
i
might
have
been
chief
mate
scores
of
times
maybe
master
but
i
had
no
ambition
i
seed
many
strange
things
in
them
years
outlandish
people
an
cities
storms
shipwracks
an
battles
i
seed
many
a
true
mate
go
down
an
sometimes
i
envied
them
what
went
to
their
rest
but
these
things
is
neither
here
nor
there
about
a
year
ago
i
shipped
on
board
the
belphoebe
yonder
an
of
all
the
strange
winds
as
ever
blowed
the
strangest
an
the
best
was
the
wind
as
blowed
me
to
this
here
blessed
spot
i
ca
be
too
thankful
that
i
as
thankful
as
it
is
possible
for
an
uneddicated
man
to
be
he
knows
as
reads
the
heart
of
here
ended
sailor
ben
yarn
which
i
have
written
down
in
his
own
homely
words
as
nearly
as
i
can
recall
them
after
he
had
finished
the
captain
shook
hands
with
him
and
served
out
the
ale
as
kitty
was
about
to
drink
she
paused
rested
the
cup
on
her
knee
and
asked
what
day
of
the
month
it
was
the
said
the
captain
wondering
what
she
was
driving
at
then
cried
kitty
it
ten
years
this
night
sence
since
what
asked
my
grandfather
sence
the
little
lass
and
i
got
spliced
roared
sailor
ben
another
coincydunce
for
you
on
hearing
this
we
all
clapped
hands
and
the
captain
with
a
degree
of
ceremony
that
was
almost
painful
drank
a
bumper
to
the
health
and
happiness
of
the
bride
and
bridegroom
it
was
a
pleasant
sight
to
see
the
two
old
lovers
sitting
side
by
side
in
spite
of
all
drinking
from
the
same
little
cup
a
battered
zinc
dipper
which
sailor
ben
had
unslung
from
a
strap
round
his
waist
i
think
i
never
saw
him
without
this
dipper
and
a
suspended
just
back
of
his
hip
ready
for
any
convivial
occasion
we
had
a
merry
time
of
it
the
captain
was
in
great
force
this
evening
and
not
only
related
his
famous
exploit
in
the
war
of
but
regaled
the
company
with
a
dashing
from
shakespeare
play
of
the
tempest
he
had
a
mellow
tenor
voice
not
shakespeare
but
the
captain
and
rolled
out
the
verse
with
a
will
the
master
the
swabber
the
boatswain
and
i
the
gunner
and
his
mate
lov
mall
meg
and
marian
and
margery
but
none
of
us
car
for
a
very
good
song
and
very
well
sung
says
sailor
ben
but
some
of
us
does
care
for
kate
is
this
shawkspear
a
seafarin
man
sir
not
at
present
replied
the
captain
with
a
monstrous
twinkle
in
his
eye
the
clock
was
striking
ten
when
the
party
broke
up
the
captain
walked
to
the
mariner
home
with
his
guest
in
order
to
question
him
regarding
his
future
movements
well
sir
said
he
i
ai
as
young
as
i
was
an
i
do
to
go
to
sea
no
more
i
proposes
to
drop
anchor
here
an
hug
the
land
until
the
old
hulk
goes
to
pieces
i
got
two
or
three
thousand
dollars
in
the
locker
an
expects
to
get
on
uncommon
comfortable
without
askin
no
odds
from
the
assylum
for
decayed
my
grandfather
indorsed
the
plan
warmly
and
sailor
ben
did
drop
anchor
in
rivermouth
where
he
speedily
became
one
of
the
institutions
of
the
town
his
first
step
was
to
buy
a
small
cottage
located
at
the
head
of
the
wharf
within
of
the
nutter
house
to
the
great
amusement
of
my
grandfather
sailor
ben
painted
the
cottage
a
light
and
ran
a
broad
black
stripe
around
it
just
under
the
eaves
in
this
stripe
he
painted
white
at
regular
distances
making
his
residence
look
as
much
like
a
as
possible
with
a
short
projecting
over
the
door
like
a
bowsprit
the
effect
was
quite
magical
my
description
of
the
exterior
of
this
palatial
residence
is
complete
when
i
add
that
the
proprietor
nailed
a
horseshoe
against
the
front
door
to
keep
off
the
witches
a
very
necessary
precaution
in
these
latitudes
the
inside
of
sailor
ben
abode
was
not
less
striking
than
the
outside
the
cottage
contained
two
rooms
the
one
opening
on
the
wharf
he
called
his
cabin
here
he
ate
and
slept
his
few
tumblers
and
a
frugal
collection
of
crockery
were
set
in
a
rack
suspended
over
the
table
which
had
a
cleat
of
wood
nailed
round
the
edge
to
prevent
the
dishes
from
sliding
off
in
case
of
a
heavy
sea
hanging
against
the
walls
were
three
or
four
highly
colored
prints
of
celebrated
frigates
and
a
lithograph
picture
of
a
rosy
young
woman
insufficiently
clad
in
the
american
flag
this
was
labelled
kitty
though
i
sure
it
looked
no
more
like
her
than
i
did
a
with
an
esquimaux
engraved
on
it
a
shark
jaw
and
the
blade
of
a
were
among
the
enviable
decorations
of
this
apartment
in
one
corner
stood
his
bunk
or
bed
and
in
the
other
his
a
perfect
pandora
box
of
mysteries
you
would
have
thought
yourself
in
the
cabin
of
a
real
ship
the
little
room
aft
separated
from
the
cabin
by
a
sliding
door
was
the
caboose
it
held
a
pots
pans
and
groceries
also
a
lot
of
and
coils
of
tarred
twine
which
made
the
place
smell
like
a
forecastle
and
a
delightful
smell
it
is
to
those
who
fancy
it
kitty
did
leave
our
service
but
played
housekeeper
for
both
establishments
returning
at
night
to
sailor
ben
he
shortly
added
a
wherry
to
his
worldly
goods
and
in
the
fishing
season
made
a
very
handsome
income
during
the
winter
he
employed
himself
manufacturing
for
which
he
found
no
lack
of
customers
his
popularity
among
the
boys
was
immense
a
jackknife
in
his
expert
hand
was
a
whole
chest
of
tools
he
could
whittle
out
anything
from
a
wooden
chain
to
a
chinese
pagoda
or
a
a
foot
long
to
own
a
ship
of
sailor
ben
building
was
to
be
exalted
above
your
he
did
carve
many
and
those
he
refused
to
sell
choosing
to
present
them
to
his
young
friends
of
whom
tom
bailey
you
may
be
sure
was
one
how
delightful
it
was
of
winter
nights
to
sit
in
his
cosey
cabin
close
to
the
ship
stove
he
would
hear
of
having
a
fireplace
and
listen
to
sailor
ben
yarns
in
the
early
summer
twilights
when
he
sat
on
the
splicing
a
rope
or
mending
a
net
he
always
had
a
bevy
of
blooming
young
faces
alongside
the
dear
old
fellow
how
tenderly
the
years
touched
him
after
this
all
the
more
tenderly
it
seemed
for
having
roughed
him
so
cruelly
in
other
days
chapter
seventeen
how
we
astonished
the
rivermouthians
sailor
ben
arrival
partly
drove
the
new
orleans
project
from
my
brain
besides
there
was
just
then
a
certain
movement
on
foot
by
the
centipede
club
which
helped
to
engross
my
attention
pepper
whitcomb
took
the
captain
veto
philosophically
observing
that
he
thought
from
the
first
the
governor
would
let
me
go
i
do
think
pepper
was
quite
honest
in
that
but
to
the
subject
in
hand
among
the
few
changes
that
have
taken
place
in
rivermouth
during
the
past
twenty
years
there
is
one
which
i
regret
i
lament
the
removal
of
all
those
varnished
iron
cannon
which
used
to
do
duty
as
posts
at
the
corners
of
streets
leading
from
the
river
they
were
quaintly
ornamental
each
set
upon
end
with
a
solid
shot
soldered
into
its
mouth
and
gave
to
that
part
of
the
town
a
picturesqueness
very
poorly
atoned
for
by
the
conventional
wooden
stakes
that
have
deposed
them
these
guns
old
sogers
the
boys
called
them
had
their
story
like
everything
else
in
rivermouth
when
that
everlasting
last
war
the
war
of
i
mean
came
to
an
end
all
the
brigs
schooners
and
barks
fitted
out
at
this
port
as
privateers
were
as
eager
to
get
rid
of
their
useless
and
swivels
as
they
had
previously
been
to
obtain
them
many
of
the
pieces
had
cost
large
sums
and
now
they
were
little
better
than
so
much
crude
iron
not
so
good
in
fact
for
they
were
clumsy
things
to
break
up
and
melt
over
the
government
did
want
them
private
citizens
did
want
them
they
were
a
drug
in
the
market
but
there
was
one
man
ridiculous
beyond
his
generation
who
got
it
into
his
head
that
a
fortune
was
to
be
made
out
of
these
same
guns
to
buy
them
all
to
hold
on
to
them
until
war
was
declared
again
as
he
had
no
doubt
it
would
be
in
a
few
months
and
then
sell
out
at
fabulous
prices
this
was
the
daring
idea
that
addled
the
pate
of
silas
trefethen
dealer
in
i
goods
and
groceries
as
the
faded
sign
over
his
informed
the
public
silas
went
shrewdly
to
work
buying
up
every
old
cannon
he
could
lay
hands
on
his
was
soon
crowded
with
and
his
barn
with
guns
like
an
arsenal
when
silas
purpose
got
wind
it
was
astonishing
how
valuable
that
thing
became
which
just
now
was
worth
nothing
at
all
ha
ha
thought
silas
somebody
else
is
tryin
hi
git
control
of
the
market
but
i
guess
i
got
the
start
of
so
he
went
on
buying
and
buying
oftentimes
paying
double
the
original
price
of
the
article
people
in
the
neighboring
towns
collected
all
the
worthless
ordnance
they
could
find
and
sent
it
by
the
to
rivermouth
when
his
barn
was
full
silas
began
piling
the
rubbish
in
his
cellar
then
in
his
parlor
he
mortgaged
the
stock
of
his
grocery
store
mortgaged
his
house
his
barn
his
horse
and
would
have
mortgaged
himself
if
anyone
would
have
taken
him
as
security
in
order
to
carry
on
the
grand
speculation
he
was
a
ruined
man
and
as
happy
as
a
lark
surely
poor
silas
was
cracked
like
the
majority
of
his
own
cannon
more
or
less
crazy
he
must
have
been
always
years
before
this
he
purchased
an
elegant
rosewood
coffin
and
kept
it
in
one
of
the
spare
rooms
in
his
residence
he
even
had
his
name
engraved
on
the
leaving
a
blank
after
the
word
the
blank
was
filled
up
in
due
time
and
well
it
was
for
silas
that
he
secured
so
stylish
a
coffin
in
his
opulent
days
for
when
he
died
his
worldly
wealth
would
not
have
bought
him
a
pine
box
to
say
nothing
of
rosewood
he
never
gave
up
expecting
a
war
with
great
britain
hopeful
and
radiant
to
the
last
his
dying
words
were
england
war
few
days
great
profits
it
was
that
sweet
old
lady
dame
jocelyn
who
told
me
the
story
of
silas
trefethen
for
these
things
happened
long
before
my
day
silas
died
in
at
trefethen
death
his
unique
collection
came
under
the
hammer
some
of
the
larger
guns
were
sold
to
the
town
and
planted
at
the
corners
of
divers
streets
others
went
off
to
the
the
balance
numbering
twelve
were
dumped
down
on
a
deserted
wharf
at
the
foot
of
anchor
lane
where
summer
after
summer
they
rested
at
their
ease
in
the
grass
and
fungi
pelted
in
autumn
by
the
rain
and
annually
buried
by
the
winter
snow
it
is
with
these
twelve
guns
that
our
story
has
to
deal
the
wharf
where
they
reposed
was
shut
off
from
the
street
by
a
high
fence
a
silent
dreamy
old
wharf
covered
with
strange
weeds
and
mosses
on
account
of
its
seclusion
and
the
good
fishing
it
afforded
it
was
much
frequented
by
us
boys
there
we
met
many
an
afternoon
to
throw
out
our
lines
or
play
among
the
rusty
cannon
they
were
famous
fellows
in
our
eyes
what
a
racket
they
had
made
in
the
heyday
of
their
unchastened
youth
what
stories
they
might
tell
now
if
their
puffy
metallic
lips
could
only
speak
once
they
were
lively
talkers
enough
but
there
the
grim
lay
silent
and
forlorn
in
spite
of
all
their
former
growlings
they
always
seemed
to
me
like
a
lot
of
venerable
disabled
tars
stretched
out
on
a
lawn
in
front
of
a
hospital
gazing
seaward
and
mutely
lamenting
their
lost
youth
but
once
more
they
were
destined
to
lift
up
their
dolorous
voices
once
more
ere
they
keeled
over
and
lay
speechless
for
all
time
and
this
is
how
it
befell
jack
harris
charley
marden
harry
blake
and
myself
were
fishing
off
the
wharf
one
afternoon
when
a
thought
flashed
upon
me
like
an
inspiration
i
say
boys
i
cried
hauling
in
my
line
hand
over
hand
i
got
something
what
does
it
pull
like
youngster
asked
harris
looking
down
at
the
taut
line
and
expecting
to
see
a
big
perch
at
least
o
nothing
in
the
fish
way
i
returned
laughing
it
about
the
old
what
about
them
i
was
thinking
what
jolly
fun
it
would
be
to
set
one
of
the
old
sogers
on
his
legs
and
serve
him
out
a
ration
of
up
came
the
three
lines
in
a
jiffy
an
enterprise
better
suited
to
the
disposition
of
my
companions
could
not
have
been
proposed
in
a
short
time
we
had
one
of
the
smaller
cannon
over
on
its
back
and
were
busy
scraping
the
green
rust
from
the
the
mould
had
spiked
the
gun
so
effectually
that
for
a
while
we
fancied
we
should
have
to
give
up
our
attempt
to
resuscitate
the
old
soger
a
long
gimlet
would
clear
it
out
said
charley
marden
if
we
only
had
i
looked
to
see
if
sailor
ben
flag
was
flying
at
the
cabin
door
for
he
always
took
in
the
colors
when
he
went
off
fishing
when
you
want
to
know
if
the
admiral
aboard
jest
cast
an
eye
to
the
buntin
my
hearties
says
sailor
ben
sometimes
in
a
jocose
mood
he
called
himself
the
admiral
and
i
am
sure
he
deserved
to
be
one
the
admiral
flag
was
flying
and
i
soon
procured
a
gimlet
from
his
carefully
kept
before
long
we
had
the
gun
in
working
order
a
newspaper
lashed
to
the
end
of
a
lath
served
as
a
swab
to
dust
out
the
bore
jack
harris
blew
through
the
and
pronounced
all
clear
seeing
our
task
accomplished
so
easily
we
turned
our
attention
to
the
other
guns
which
lay
in
all
sorts
of
postures
in
the
rank
grass
borrowing
a
rope
from
sailor
ben
we
managed
with
immense
labor
to
drag
the
heavy
pieces
into
position
and
place
a
brick
under
each
muzzle
to
give
it
the
proper
elevation
when
we
beheld
them
all
in
a
row
like
a
regular
battery
we
simultaneously
conceived
an
idea
the
magnitude
of
which
struck
us
dumb
for
a
moment
our
first
intention
was
to
load
and
fire
a
single
gun
how
feeble
and
insignificant
was
such
a
plan
compared
to
that
which
now
sent
the
light
dancing
into
our
eyes
what
could
we
have
been
thinking
of
cried
jack
harris
we
give
a
broadside
to
be
sure
if
we
die
for
it
we
turned
to
with
a
will
and
before
nightfall
had
nearly
half
the
battery
overhauled
and
ready
for
service
to
keep
the
artillery
dry
we
stuffed
wads
of
loose
hemp
into
the
muzzles
and
fitted
wooden
pegs
to
the
at
recess
the
next
noon
the
centipedes
met
in
a
corner
of
the
to
talk
over
the
proposed
lark
the
original
projectors
though
they
would
have
liked
to
keep
the
thing
secret
were
obliged
to
make
a
club
matter
of
it
inasmuch
as
funds
were
required
for
ammunition
there
had
been
no
recent
drain
on
the
treasury
and
the
society
could
well
afford
to
spend
a
few
dollars
in
so
notable
an
undertaking
it
was
unanimously
agreed
that
the
plan
should
be
carried
out
in
the
handsomest
manner
and
a
subscription
to
that
end
was
taken
on
the
spot
several
of
the
centipedes
had
a
cent
excepting
the
one
strung
around
their
necks
others
however
were
richer
i
chanced
to
have
a
dollar
and
it
went
into
the
cap
quicker
than
lightning
when
the
club
in
view
of
my
munificence
voted
to
name
the
guns
bailey
battery
i
was
prouder
than
i
have
ever
been
since
over
anything
the
money
thus
raised
added
to
that
already
in
the
treasury
amounted
to
nine
dollars
a
fortune
in
those
days
but
not
more
than
we
had
use
for
this
sum
was
divided
into
twelve
parts
for
it
would
not
do
for
one
boy
to
buy
all
the
powder
nor
even
for
us
all
to
make
our
purchases
at
the
same
place
that
would
excite
suspicion
at
any
time
particularly
at
a
period
so
remote
from
the
fourth
of
july
there
were
only
three
stores
in
town
licensed
to
sell
powder
that
gave
each
store
four
customers
not
to
run
the
slightest
risk
of
remark
one
boy
bought
his
powder
on
monday
the
next
boy
on
tuesday
and
so
on
until
the
requisite
quantity
was
in
our
possession
this
we
put
into
a
keg
and
carefully
hid
in
a
dry
spot
on
the
wharf
our
next
step
was
to
finish
cleaning
the
guns
which
occupied
two
afternoons
for
several
of
the
old
sogers
were
in
a
very
congested
state
indeed
having
completed
the
task
we
came
upon
a
difficulty
to
set
off
the
battery
by
daylight
was
out
of
the
question
it
must
be
done
at
night
it
must
be
done
with
fuses
for
no
doubt
the
neighbors
would
turn
out
after
the
first
two
or
three
shots
and
it
would
not
pay
to
be
caught
in
the
vicinity
who
knew
anything
about
fuses
who
could
arrange
it
so
the
guns
would
go
off
one
after
the
other
with
an
interval
of
a
minute
or
so
between
theoretically
we
knew
that
a
minute
fuse
lasted
a
minute
double
the
quantity
two
minutes
but
practically
we
were
at
a
there
was
but
one
person
who
could
help
us
in
this
extremity
sailor
ben
to
me
was
assigned
the
duty
of
obtaining
what
information
i
could
from
the
it
being
left
to
my
discretion
whether
or
not
to
intrust
him
with
our
secret
so
one
evening
i
dropped
into
the
cabin
and
artfully
turned
the
conversation
to
fuses
in
general
and
then
to
particular
fuses
but
without
getting
much
out
of
the
old
boy
who
was
busy
making
a
twine
hammock
finally
i
was
forced
to
divulge
the
whole
plot
the
admiral
had
a
sailor
love
for
a
joke
and
entered
at
once
and
heartily
into
our
scheme
he
volunteered
to
prepare
the
fuses
himself
and
i
left
the
labor
in
his
hands
having
bound
him
by
several
extraordinary
oaths
such
as
and
not
to
betray
us
come
what
would
this
was
monday
evening
on
wednesday
the
fuses
were
ready
that
night
we
were
to
unmuzzle
bailey
battery
grimshaw
saw
that
something
was
wrong
somewhere
for
we
were
restless
and
in
the
classes
and
the
best
of
us
came
to
grief
before
the
morning
session
was
over
when
grimshaw
announced
guy
fawkes
as
the
subject
for
our
next
composition
you
might
have
knocked
down
the
mystic
twelve
with
a
feather
the
coincidence
was
certainly
curious
but
when
a
man
has
committed
or
is
about
to
commit
an
offence
a
hundred
trifles
which
would
pass
unnoticed
at
another
time
seem
to
point
at
him
with
convicting
fingers
no
doubt
guy
fawkes
himself
received
many
a
start
after
he
had
got
his
wicked
kegs
of
gunpowder
neatly
piled
up
under
the
house
of
lords
wednesday
as
i
have
mentioned
was
a
and
the
centipedes
assembled
in
my
barn
to
decide
on
the
final
arrangements
these
were
as
simple
as
could
be
as
the
fuses
were
connected
it
needed
but
one
person
to
fire
the
train
hereupon
arose
a
discussion
as
to
who
was
the
proper
person
some
argued
that
i
ought
to
apply
the
match
the
battery
being
christened
after
me
and
the
main
idea
moreover
being
mine
others
advocated
the
claim
of
phil
adams
as
the
oldest
boy
at
last
we
drew
lots
for
the
post
of
honor
twelve
slips
of
folded
paper
upon
one
of
which
was
written
thou
art
the
man
were
placed
in
a
quart
measure
and
thoroughly
shaken
then
each
member
stepped
up
and
lifted
out
his
destiny
at
a
given
signal
we
opened
our
billets
thou
art
the
man
said
the
slip
of
paper
trembling
in
my
fingers
the
sweets
and
anxieties
of
a
leader
were
mine
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
directly
after
twilight
set
in
phil
adams
stole
down
to
the
wharf
and
fixed
the
fuses
to
the
guns
laying
a
train
of
powder
from
the
principal
fuse
to
the
fence
through
a
chink
of
which
i
was
to
drop
the
match
at
midnight
at
ten
rivermouth
goes
to
bed
at
eleven
rivermouth
is
as
quiet
as
a
country
churchyard
at
twelve
there
is
nothing
left
with
which
to
compare
the
stillness
that
broods
over
the
little
seaport
in
the
midst
of
this
stillness
i
arose
and
glided
out
of
the
house
like
a
phantom
bent
on
an
evil
errand
like
a
phantom
i
flitted
through
the
silent
street
hardly
drawing
breath
until
i
knelt
down
beside
the
fence
at
the
appointed
place
pausing
a
moment
for
my
heart
to
stop
thumping
i
lighted
the
match
and
shielded
it
with
both
hands
until
it
was
well
under
way
and
then
dropped
the
blazing
splinter
on
the
slender
thread
of
gunpowder
a
noiseless
flash
instantly
followed
and
all
was
dark
again
i
peeped
through
the
crevice
in
the
fence
and
saw
the
main
fuse
spitting
out
sparks
like
a
conjurer
assured
that
the
train
had
not
failed
i
took
to
my
heels
fearful
lest
the
fuse
might
burn
more
rapidly
than
we
calculated
and
cause
an
explosion
before
i
could
get
home
this
luckily
did
not
happen
there
a
special
providence
that
watches
over
idiots
drunken
men
and
boys
i
dodged
the
ceremony
of
undressing
by
plunging
into
bed
jacket
boots
and
all
i
am
not
sure
i
took
off
my
cap
but
i
know
that
i
had
hardly
pulled
the
coverlid
over
me
when
boom
sounded
the
first
gun
of
bailey
battery
i
lay
as
still
as
a
mouse
in
less
than
two
minutes
there
was
another
burst
of
thunder
and
then
another
the
third
gun
was
a
tremendous
fellow
and
fairly
shook
the
house
the
town
was
waking
up
windows
were
thrown
open
here
and
there
and
people
called
to
each
other
across
the
streets
asking
what
that
firing
was
for
boom
went
gun
number
four
i
sprung
out
of
bed
and
tore
off
my
jacket
for
i
heard
the
captain
feeling
his
way
along
the
wall
to
my
chamber
i
was
half
undressed
by
the
time
he
found
the
knob
of
the
door
i
say
sir
i
cried
do
you
hear
those
guns
not
being
deaf
i
do
said
the
captain
a
little
tartly
any
reflection
on
his
hearing
always
nettled
him
but
what
on
earth
they
are
for
i
ca
conceive
you
had
better
get
up
and
dress
i
nearly
dressed
boom
boom
two
of
the
guns
had
gone
off
together
the
door
of
miss
abigail
bedroom
opened
hastily
and
that
pink
of
maidenly
propriety
stepped
out
into
the
hail
in
her
the
only
indecorous
thing
i
ever
knew
her
to
do
she
held
a
lighted
candle
in
her
hand
and
looked
like
a
very
aged
lady
macbeth
o
this
is
dreadful
what
do
you
suppose
it
means
i
really
ca
suppose
said
the
captain
rubbing
his
ear
but
i
guess
it
over
boom
said
bailey
battery
rivermouth
was
wide
awake
now
and
half
the
male
population
were
in
the
streets
running
different
ways
for
the
firing
seemed
to
proceed
from
opposite
points
of
the
town
everybody
waylaid
everybody
else
with
questions
but
as
no
one
knew
what
was
the
occasion
of
the
tumult
people
who
were
not
usually
nervous
began
to
be
oppressed
by
the
mystery
some
thought
the
town
was
being
bombarded
some
thought
the
world
was
coming
to
an
end
as
the
pious
and
ingenious
miller
had
predicted
it
would
but
those
who
could
form
any
theory
whatever
were
the
most
perplexed
in
the
meanwhile
bailey
battery
bellowed
away
at
regular
intervals
the
greatest
confusion
reigned
everywhere
by
this
time
people
with
lanterns
rushed
hither
and
thither
the
town
watch
had
turned
out
to
a
man
and
marched
off
in
admirable
order
in
the
wrong
direction
discovering
their
mistake
they
retraced
their
steps
and
got
down
to
the
wharf
just
as
the
last
cannon
belched
forth
its
lightning
a
dense
cloud
of
sulphurous
smoke
floated
over
anchor
lane
obscuring
the
starlight
two
or
three
hundred
people
in
various
stages
of
excitement
crowded
about
the
upper
end
of
the
wharf
not
liking
to
advance
farther
until
they
were
satisfied
that
the
explosions
were
over
a
board
was
here
and
there
blown
from
the
fence
and
through
the
openings
thus
afforded
a
few
of
the
more
daring
spirits
at
length
ventured
to
crawl
the
cause
of
the
racket
soon
transpired
a
suspicion
that
they
had
been
sold
gradually
dawned
on
the
rivermouthians
many
were
exceedingly
indignant
and
declared
that
no
penalty
was
severe
enough
for
those
concerned
in
such
a
prank
others
and
these
were
the
very
people
who
had
been
terrified
nearly
out
of
their
wits
had
the
assurance
to
laugh
saying
that
they
knew
all
along
it
was
only
a
trick
the
town
watch
boldly
took
possession
of
the
ground
and
the
crowd
began
to
disperse
knots
of
gossips
lingered
here
and
there
near
the
place
indulging
in
vain
surmises
as
to
who
the
invisible
gunners
could
be
there
was
no
more
noise
that
night
but
many
a
timid
person
lay
awake
expecting
a
renewal
of
the
mysterious
cannonading
the
oldest
inhabitant
refused
to
go
to
bed
on
any
terms
but
persisted
in
sitting
up
in
a
with
his
hat
and
mittens
on
until
daybreak
i
thought
i
should
never
get
to
sleep
the
moment
i
drifted
off
in
a
doze
i
fell
to
laughing
and
woke
myself
up
but
towards
morning
slumber
overtook
me
and
i
had
a
series
of
disagreeable
dreams
in
one
of
which
i
was
waited
upon
by
the
ghost
of
silas
trefethen
with
an
exorbitant
bill
for
the
use
of
his
guns
in
another
i
was
dragged
before
a
and
sentenced
by
sailor
ben
in
a
frizzled
wig
and
cocked
hat
to
be
shot
to
death
by
bailey
battery
a
sentence
which
sailor
ben
was
about
to
execute
with
his
own
hand
when
i
suddenly
opened
my
eyes
and
found
the
sunshine
lying
pleasantly
across
my
face
i
tell
you
i
was
glad
that
unaccountable
fascination
which
leads
the
guilty
to
hover
about
the
spot
where
his
crime
was
committed
drew
me
down
to
the
wharf
as
soon
as
i
was
dressed
phil
adams
jack
harris
and
others
of
the
conspirators
were
already
there
examining
with
a
mingled
feeling
of
curiosity
and
apprehension
the
havoc
accomplished
by
the
battery
the
fence
was
badly
shattered
and
the
ground
ploughed
up
for
several
yards
round
the
place
where
the
guns
formerly
lay
formerly
lay
for
now
they
were
scattered
every
which
way
there
was
scarcely
a
gun
that
had
burst
here
was
one
ripped
open
from
muzzle
to
breech
and
there
was
another
with
its
mouth
blown
into
the
shape
of
a
trumpet
three
of
the
guns
had
disappeared
bodily
but
on
looking
over
the
edge
of
the
wharf
we
saw
them
standing
on
end
in
the
they
had
popped
overboard
in
their
excitement
i
tell
you
what
fellows
whispered
phil
adams
it
is
lucky
we
try
to
touch
off
with
punk
they
have
blown
us
all
to
the
destruction
of
bailey
battery
was
not
unfortunately
the
only
catastrophe
a
fragment
of
one
of
the
cannon
had
earned
away
the
chimney
of
sailor
ben
cabin
he
was
very
mad
at
first
but
having
prepared
the
fuse
himself
he
did
dare
complain
openly
i
have
taken
a
reef
in
the
blessed
said
the
admiral
gazing
ruefully
at
the
smashed
chimney
if
i
had
known
as
how
the
flagship
was
agoin
to
be
under
the
next
day
he
rigged
out
an
iron
funnel
which
being
in
sections
could
be
detached
and
taken
in
at
a
moment
notice
on
the
whole
i
think
he
was
resigned
to
the
demolition
of
his
brick
chimney
the
was
a
great
deal
more
shipshape
the
town
was
not
so
easily
appeased
the
selectmen
determined
to
make
an
example
of
the
guilty
parties
and
offered
a
reward
for
their
arrest
holding
out
a
promise
of
pardon
to
anyone
of
the
offenders
who
would
furnish
information
against
the
rest
but
there
were
no
faint
hearts
among
the
centipedes
suspicion
rested
for
a
while
on
several
persons
on
the
soldiers
at
the
fort
on
a
crazy
fellow
known
about
town
as
and
at
last
on
sailor
ben
shiver
my
timbers
cries
that
deeply
injured
individual
do
you
suppose
sir
as
i
have
lived
to
sixty
year
an
ai
got
no
more
sense
than
to
go
for
to
blaze
away
at
my
own
upper
riggin
it
does
stand
to
it
certainly
did
not
seem
probable
that
watson
would
maliciously
knock
over
his
own
chimney
and
lawyer
hackett
who
had
the
case
in
hand
himself
out
of
the
admiral
cabin
convinced
that
the
right
man
had
not
been
discovered
people
living
by
the
sea
are
always
more
or
less
superstitious
stories
of
spectre
ships
and
mysterious
beacons
that
lure
vessels
out
of
their
course
and
wreck
them
on
unknown
reefs
were
among
the
stock
legends
of
rivermouth
and
not
a
few
people
in
the
town
were
ready
to
attribute
the
firing
of
those
guns
to
some
supernatural
agency
the
oldest
inhabitant
remembered
that
when
he
was
a
boy
a
sort
of
schooner
hove
to
in
the
offing
one
foggy
afternoon
fired
off
a
single
gun
that
make
any
report
and
then
crumbled
to
nothing
spar
mast
and
hulk
like
a
piece
of
burnt
paper
the
authorities
however
were
of
the
opinion
that
human
hands
had
something
to
do
with
the
explosions
and
they
resorted
to
stratagems
to
get
hold
of
the
said
hands
one
of
their
traps
came
very
near
catching
us
they
artfully
caused
an
old
brass
fieldpiece
to
be
left
on
a
wharf
near
the
scene
of
our
late
operations
nothing
in
the
world
but
the
lack
of
money
to
buy
powder
saved
us
from
falling
into
the
clutches
of
the
two
watchmen
who
lay
secreted
for
a
week
in
a
neighboring
it
was
many
a
day
before
the
midnight
bombardment
ceased
to
be
the
the
trick
was
so
audacious
and
on
so
grand
a
scale
that
nobody
thought
for
an
instant
of
connecting
us
lads
with
it
suspicion
at
length
grew
weary
of
lighting
on
the
wrong
person
and
as
conjecture
like
the
physicians
in
the
epitaph
was
in
vain
the
rivermouthians
gave
up
the
idea
of
finding
out
who
had
astonished
them
they
never
did
find
out
and
never
will
unless
they
read
this
veracious
history
if
the
selectmen
are
still
disposed
to
punish
the
malefactors
i
can
supply
lawyer
hackett
with
evidence
enough
to
convict
pepper
whitcomb
phil
adams
charley
marden
and
the
other
honorable
members
of
the
centipede
club
but
really
i
do
think
it
would
pay
now
chapter
eighteen
a
frog
he
would
go
if
the
reader
supposes
that
i
lived
all
this
while
in
rivermouth
without
falling
a
victim
to
one
or
more
of
the
young
ladies
attending
miss
dorothy
gibbs
female
institute
why
then
all
i
have
to
say
is
the
reader
exhibits
his
ignorance
of
human
nature
miss
gibbs
seminary
was
located
within
a
few
minutes
walk
of
the
temple
grammar
school
and
numbered
about
pupils
the
majority
of
whom
boarded
at
the
hall
primrose
hall
as
miss
dorothy
prettily
called
it
the
as
we
called
them
ranged
from
seven
years
of
age
to
sweet
seventeen
and
a
prettier
group
of
sirens
never
got
together
even
in
rivermouth
for
rivermouth
you
should
know
is
famous
for
its
pretty
girls
there
were
tall
girls
and
short
girls
rosy
girls
and
pale
girls
and
girls
as
brown
as
berries
girls
like
amazons
slender
girls
weird
and
winning
like
undine
girls
with
black
tresses
girls
with
auburn
ringlets
girls
with
every
tinge
of
golden
hair
to
behold
miss
dorothy
young
ladies
of
a
sunday
morning
walking
to
church
two
by
two
the
smallest
toddling
at
the
end
of
the
procession
like
the
bobs
at
the
tail
of
a
kite
was
a
spectacle
to
fill
with
tender
emotion
the
least
susceptible
heart
to
see
miss
dorothy
marching
grimly
at
the
head
of
her
light
infantry
was
to
feel
the
hopelessness
of
making
an
attack
on
any
part
of
the
column
she
was
a
perfect
dragon
of
watchfulness
the
most
unguarded
lifting
of
an
eyelash
in
the
fluttering
battalion
was
sufficient
to
put
her
on
the
lookout
she
had
had
experiences
with
the
male
sex
this
miss
dorothy
so
prim
and
grim
it
was
whispered
that
her
heart
was
a
tattered
album
scrawled
over
with
but
that
she
had
shut
up
the
volume
long
ago
there
was
a
tradition
that
she
had
been
crossed
in
love
but
it
was
the
faintest
of
traditions
a
gay
young
lieutenant
of
marines
had
flirted
with
her
at
a
country
ball
and
then
marched
carelessly
away
at
the
head
of
his
company
to
the
shrill
music
of
the
fife
without
so
much
as
a
sigh
for
the
girl
he
left
behind
him
the
years
rolled
on
the
gallant
gay
lothario
which
was
his
name
married
became
a
father
and
then
a
grandfather
and
at
the
period
of
which
i
am
speaking
his
grandchild
was
actually
one
of
miss
dorothy
young
ladies
so
at
least
ran
the
story
the
lieutenant
himself
was
dead
these
many
years
but
miss
dorothy
never
got
over
his
duplicity
she
was
convinced
that
the
sole
aim
of
mankind
was
to
win
the
unguarded
affection
of
maidens
and
then
march
off
treacherously
with
flying
colors
to
the
heartless
music
of
the
drum
and
fife
to
shield
the
inmates
of
primrose
hall
from
the
bitter
influences
that
had
blighted
her
own
early
affections
was
miss
dorothy
mission
in
life
no
wolves
prowling
about
my
lambs
if
you
please
said
miss
dorothy
i
will
not
allow
she
was
as
good
as
her
word
i
do
think
the
boy
lives
who
ever
set
foot
within
the
limits
of
primrose
hall
while
the
seminary
was
under
her
charge
perhaps
if
miss
dorothy
had
given
her
young
ladies
a
little
more
liberty
they
would
not
have
thought
it
such
fun
to
make
eyes
over
the
white
lattice
fence
at
the
young
gentlemen
of
the
temple
grammar
school
i
say
perhaps
for
it
is
one
thing
to
manage
young
ladies
and
quite
another
thing
to
talk
about
it
but
all
miss
dorothy
vigilance
could
not
prevent
the
young
folks
from
meeting
in
the
town
now
and
then
nor
could
her
utmost
ingenuity
interrupt
postal
arrangements
there
was
no
end
of
notes
passing
between
the
students
and
the
primroses
notes
tied
to
the
heads
of
arrows
were
shot
into
dormitory
windows
notes
were
tucked
under
fences
and
hidden
in
the
trunks
of
decayed
trees
every
thick
place
in
the
boxwood
hedge
that
surrounded
the
seminary
was
a
possible
it
was
a
terrible
shock
to
miss
dorothy
the
day
she
unearthed
a
nest
of
letters
in
one
of
the
huge
wooden
urns
surmounting
the
gateway
that
led
to
her
dovecot
it
was
a
bitter
moment
to
miss
phoebe
and
miss
candace
and
miss
hesba
when
they
had
their
locks
of
hair
grimly
handed
back
to
them
by
miss
gibbs
in
the
presence
of
the
whole
school
girls
whose
locks
of
hair
had
run
the
blockade
in
safety
were
particularly
severe
on
the
offenders
but
it
did
stop
other
notes
and
other
tresses
and
i
would
like
to
know
what
can
stop
them
while
the
earth
holds
together
now
when
i
first
came
to
rivermouth
i
looked
upon
girls
as
rather
tame
company
i
had
a
spark
of
sentiment
concerning
them
but
seeing
my
comrades
sending
and
receiving
mysterious
epistles
wearing
bits
of
ribbon
in
their
and
leaving
packages
of
confectionery
generally
in
the
hollow
trunks
of
trees
why
i
felt
that
this
was
the
proper
thing
to
do
i
resolved
as
a
matter
of
duty
to
fall
in
love
with
somebody
and
i
did
care
in
the
least
who
it
was
in
much
the
same
mood
that
don
quixote
selected
the
dulcinea
del
toboso
for
his
i
singled
out
one
of
miss
dorothy
incomparable
young
ladies
for
mine
i
debated
a
long
while
whether
i
should
not
select
two
but
at
last
settled
down
on
one
a
pale
little
girl
with
blue
eyes
named
alice
i
shall
not
make
a
long
story
of
this
for
alice
made
short
work
of
me
she
was
secretly
in
love
with
pepper
whitcomb
this
occasioned
a
temporary
coolness
between
pepper
and
myself
not
disheartened
however
i
placed
laura
rice
i
believe
it
was
laura
rice
in
the
vacant
niche
the
new
idol
was
more
cruel
than
the
old
the
former
frankly
sent
me
to
the
right
about
but
the
latter
was
a
deceitful
lot
she
wore
my
nosegay
in
her
dress
at
the
evening
service
the
primroses
were
marched
to
church
three
times
every
sunday
she
penned
me
the
daintiest
of
notes
she
sent
me
the
glossiest
of
ringlets
cut
as
i
afterwards
found
out
from
the
stupid
head
of
miss
and
at
the
same
time
was
holding
me
and
my
pony
up
to
ridicule
in
a
series
of
letters
written
to
jack
harris
it
was
harris
himself
who
kindly
opened
my
eyes
i
tell
you
what
bailey
said
that
young
gentleman
laura
is
an
old
veteran
and
carries
too
many
guns
for
a
youngster
she
ca
resist
a
flirtation
i
believe
she
flirt
with
an
infant
in
arms
there
hardly
a
fellow
in
the
school
that
has
worn
her
colors
and
some
of
her
hair
she
does
give
out
any
more
of
her
own
hair
now
it
been
pretty
well
used
up
the
demand
was
greater
than
the
supply
you
see
it
all
very
well
to
correspond
with
laura
but
as
to
looking
for
anything
serious
from
her
the
knowing
ones
do
hope
i
have
hurt
your
feelings
old
boy
that
was
a
soothing
stroke
of
flattery
to
call
me
old
boy
but
it
was
my
duty
as
a
friend
and
a
centipede
to
let
you
know
who
you
were
dealing
such
was
the
advice
given
me
by
that
careworn
and
embittered
man
of
the
world
who
was
sixteen
years
old
if
he
was
a
day
i
dropped
laura
in
the
course
of
the
next
twelve
months
i
had
perhaps
three
or
four
similar
experiences
and
the
conclusion
was
forced
upon
me
that
i
was
not
a
boy
likely
to
distinguish
myself
in
this
branch
of
business
i
fought
shy
of
primrose
hall
from
that
moment
smiles
were
smiled
over
the
boxwood
hedge
and
little
hands
were
occasionally
kissed
to
me
but
i
only
winked
my
eye
patronizingly
and
passed
on
i
never
renewed
tender
relations
with
miss
gibbs
young
ladies
all
this
occurred
during
my
first
year
and
a
half
at
rivermouth
between
my
studies
at
school
my
recreations
and
the
hurts
my
vanity
received
i
managed
to
escape
for
the
time
being
any
very
serious
attack
of
that
love
fever
which
like
the
measles
is
almost
certain
to
seize
upon
a
boy
sooner
or
later
i
was
not
to
be
an
exception
i
was
merely
biding
my
time
the
incidents
i
have
now
to
relate
took
place
shortly
after
the
events
described
in
the
last
chapter
in
a
life
so
tranquil
and
circumscribed
as
ours
in
the
nutter
house
a
visitor
was
a
novelty
of
no
little
importance
the
whole
household
awoke
from
its
quietude
one
morning
when
the
captain
announced
that
a
young
niece
of
his
from
new
york
was
to
spend
a
few
weeks
with
us
the
room
into
which
a
ray
of
sun
was
never
allowed
to
penetrate
was
thrown
open
and
dusted
and
its
mouldy
air
made
sweet
with
a
bouquet
of
placed
on
the
bureau
kitty
was
busy
all
the
forenoon
washing
off
the
sidewalk
and
the
great
brass
knocker
on
our
and
miss
abigail
was
up
to
her
elbows
in
a
i
felt
sure
it
was
for
no
ordinary
person
that
all
these
preparations
were
in
progress
and
i
was
right
miss
nelly
glentworth
was
no
ordinary
person
i
shall
never
believe
she
was
there
may
have
been
lovelier
women
though
i
have
never
seen
them
there
may
have
been
more
brilliant
women
though
it
has
not
been
my
fortune
to
meet
them
but
that
there
was
ever
a
more
charming
one
than
nelly
glentworth
is
a
proposition
against
which
i
contend
i
do
love
her
now
i
do
think
of
her
once
in
five
years
and
yet
it
would
give
me
a
turn
if
in
the
course
of
my
daily
walk
i
should
suddenly
come
upon
her
eldest
boy
i
may
say
that
her
eldest
boy
was
not
playing
a
prominent
part
in
this
life
when
i
first
made
her
acquaintance
it
was
a
drizzling
cheerless
afternoon
towards
the
end
of
summer
that
a
hack
drew
up
at
the
door
of
the
nutter
house
the
captain
and
miss
abigail
hastened
into
the
hall
on
hearing
the
carriage
stop
in
a
moment
more
miss
nelly
glentworth
was
seated
in
our
undergoing
a
critical
examination
at
the
hands
of
a
small
boy
who
lounged
uncomfortably
on
a
settee
between
the
windows
the
small
boy
considered
himself
a
judge
of
girls
and
he
rapidly
came
to
the
following
conclusions
that
miss
nelly
was
about
nineteen
that
she
had
not
given
away
much
of
her
back
hair
which
hung
in
two
massive
chestnut
braids
over
her
shoulders
that
she
was
a
shade
too
pale
and
a
trifle
too
tall
that
her
hands
were
nicely
shaped
and
her
feet
much
too
diminutive
for
daily
use
he
furthermore
observed
that
her
voice
was
musical
and
that
her
face
lighted
up
with
an
indescribable
brightness
when
she
smiled
on
the
whole
the
small
boy
liked
her
well
enough
and
satisfied
that
she
was
not
a
person
to
be
afraid
of
but
on
the
contrary
one
who
might
be
made
quite
agreeable
he
departed
to
keep
an
appointment
with
his
friend
sir
pepper
whitcomb
but
the
next
morning
when
miss
glentworth
came
down
to
breakfast
in
a
purple
dress
her
face
as
fresh
as
one
of
the
on
the
bureau
upstairs
and
her
laugh
as
contagious
as
the
merriment
of
a
robin
the
small
boy
experienced
a
strange
sensation
and
mentally
compared
her
with
the
loveliest
of
miss
gibbs
young
ladies
and
found
those
young
ladies
wanting
in
the
balance
a
night
rest
had
wrought
a
wonderful
change
in
miss
nelly
the
pallor
and
weariness
of
the
journey
had
passed
away
i
looked
at
her
through
the
and
thought
i
had
never
seen
anything
more
winning
than
her
smile
after
breakfast
she
went
out
with
me
to
the
stable
to
see
gypsy
and
the
three
of
us
became
friends
then
and
there
nelly
was
the
only
girl
that
gypsy
ever
took
the
slightest
notice
of
it
chanced
to
be
a
and
a
baseball
match
of
unusual
interest
was
to
come
off
on
the
school
ground
that
afternoon
but
somehow
i
did
go
i
hung
about
the
house
abstractedly
the
captain
went
up
town
and
miss
abigail
was
busy
in
the
kitchen
making
immortal
gingerbread
i
drifted
into
the
and
had
our
guest
all
to
myself
for
i
do
know
how
many
hours
it
was
twilight
i
recollect
when
the
captain
returned
with
letters
for
miss
nelly
many
a
time
after
that
i
sat
with
her
through
the
dreamy
september
afternoons
if
i
had
played
baseball
it
would
have
been
much
better
for
me
those
first
days
of
miss
nelly
visit
are
very
misty
in
my
remembrance
i
try
in
vain
to
remember
just
when
i
began
to
fall
in
love
with
her
the
spell
worked
upon
me
gradually
or
fell
upon
me
all
at
once
i
do
know
i
only
know
that
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
i
had
always
loved
her
things
that
took
place
before
she
came
were
dim
to
me
like
events
that
had
occurred
in
the
middle
ages
nelly
was
at
least
five
years
my
senior
but
what
of
that
adam
is
the
only
man
i
ever
heard
of
who
did
in
early
youth
fall
in
love
with
a
woman
older
than
himself
and
i
am
convinced
that
he
would
have
done
so
if
he
had
had
the
opportunity
i
wonder
if
girls
from
fifteen
to
twenty
are
aware
of
the
glamour
they
cast
over
the
straggling
awkward
boys
whom
they
regard
and
treat
as
mere
children
i
wonder
now
young
women
are
so
keen
in
such
matters
i
wonder
if
miss
nelly
glentworth
never
suspected
until
the
very
last
night
of
her
visit
at
rivermouth
that
i
was
over
ears
in
love
with
her
pretty
self
and
was
suffering
pangs
as
poignant
as
if
i
had
been
ten
feet
high
and
as
old
as
methuselah
for
indeed
i
was
miserable
throughout
all
those
five
weeks
i
went
down
in
the
latin
class
at
the
rate
of
three
boys
a
day
her
fresh
young
eyes
came
between
me
and
my
book
and
there
was
an
end
of
virgil
o
love
love
love
love
is
like
a
dizziness
it
winna
let
a
body
gang
aboot
his
i
was
wretched
away
from
her
and
only
less
wretched
in
her
presence
the
special
cause
of
my
woe
was
this
i
was
simply
a
little
boy
to
miss
glentworth
i
knew
it
i
bewailed
it
i
ground
my
teeth
and
wept
in
secret
over
the
fact
if
i
had
been
aught
else
in
her
eyes
would
she
have
smoothed
my
hair
so
carelessly
sending
an
electric
shock
through
my
whole
system
would
she
have
walked
with
me
hand
in
hand
for
hours
in
the
old
garden
and
once
when
i
lay
on
the
sofa
my
head
aching
with
love
and
mortification
would
she
have
stooped
down
and
kissed
me
if
i
had
been
a
little
boy
how
i
despised
little
boys
how
i
hated
one
particular
little
boy
too
little
to
be
loved
i
smile
over
this
very
grimly
even
now
my
sorrow
was
genuine
and
bitter
it
is
a
great
mistake
on
the
part
of
elderly
people
male
and
female
to
tell
a
child
that
he
is
seeing
his
happiest
days
do
you
believe
a
word
of
it
my
little
friend
the
burdens
of
childhood
are
as
hard
to
bear
as
the
crosses
that
weigh
us
down
later
in
life
while
the
happinesses
of
childhood
are
tame
compared
with
those
of
our
maturer
years
and
even
if
this
were
not
so
it
is
rank
cruelty
to
throw
shadows
over
the
young
heart
by
croaking
be
merry
for
you
die
as
the
last
days
of
nelly
visit
drew
near
i
fell
into
a
very
unhealthy
state
of
mind
to
have
her
so
frank
and
unconsciously
coquettish
with
me
was
a
daily
torment
to
be
looked
upon
and
treated
as
a
child
was
bitter
almonds
but
the
thought
of
losing
her
altogether
was
distraction
the
summer
was
at
an
end
the
days
were
perceptibly
shorter
and
now
and
then
came
an
evening
when
it
was
chilly
enough
to
have
a
in
our
the
leaves
were
beginning
to
take
hectic
tints
and
the
wind
was
practising
the
minor
pathetic
notes
of
its
autumnal
dirge
nature
and
myself
appeared
to
be
approaching
our
dissolution
simultaneously
one
evening
the
evening
previous
to
the
day
set
for
departure
how
well
i
remember
it
i
found
her
sitting
alone
by
the
wide
looking
musingly
at
the
crackling
back
log
there
were
no
candles
in
the
room
on
her
face
and
hands
and
on
the
small
golden
cross
at
her
throat
fell
the
flickering
firelight
that
ruddy
mellow
firelight
in
which
one
grandmother
would
look
poetical
i
drew
a
low
stool
from
the
corner
and
placed
it
by
the
side
of
her
chair
she
reached
out
her
hand
to
me
as
was
her
pretty
fashion
and
so
we
sat
for
several
moments
silently
in
the
changing
glow
of
the
burning
logs
at
length
i
moved
back
the
stool
so
that
i
could
see
her
face
in
profile
without
being
seen
by
her
i
lost
her
hand
by
this
movement
but
i
could
have
spoken
with
the
listless
touch
of
her
fingers
on
mine
after
two
or
three
attempts
i
said
nelly
a
good
deal
louder
than
i
intended
perhaps
the
effort
it
cost
me
was
evident
in
my
voice
she
raised
herself
quickly
in
the
chair
and
half
turned
towards
me
well
tom
i
i
am
very
sorry
you
are
going
so
am
i
have
enjoyed
every
hour
of
my
do
you
think
you
will
ever
come
back
here
perhaps
said
nelly
and
her
eyes
wandered
off
into
the
fitful
firelight
i
suppose
you
will
forget
us
all
very
indeed
i
shall
not
i
shall
always
have
the
pleasantest
memories
of
here
the
conversation
died
a
natural
death
nelly
sank
into
a
sort
of
dream
and
i
meditated
fearing
every
moment
to
be
interrupted
by
some
member
of
the
family
i
nerved
myself
to
make
a
bold
dash
do
you
i
hesitated
do
i
what
love
anyone
very
much
why
of
course
i
do
said
nelly
scattering
her
revery
with
a
merry
laugh
i
love
uncle
nutter
and
aunt
nutter
and
you
and
towser
our
new
dog
i
could
stand
that
i
pushed
back
the
stool
impatiently
and
stood
in
front
of
her
that
not
what
i
mean
i
said
angrily
well
what
do
you
mean
do
you
love
anyone
to
marry
him
the
idea
of
it
cried
nelly
laughing
but
you
must
tell
must
tom
indeed
you
must
she
had
risen
from
the
chair
with
an
amused
perplexed
look
in
her
eyes
i
held
her
an
instant
by
the
dress
please
tell
o
you
silly
boy
cried
nelly
then
she
rumpled
my
hair
all
over
my
forehead
and
ran
laughing
out
of
the
room
suppose
cinderella
had
rumpled
the
prince
hair
all
over
his
forehead
how
would
he
have
liked
it
suppose
the
sleeping
beauty
when
the
son
with
a
kiss
set
her
and
all
the
old
clocks
agoing
in
the
castle
suppose
the
young
minx
had
looked
up
and
coolly
laughed
in
his
eye
i
guess
the
king
son
would
have
been
greatly
pleased
i
hesitated
a
second
or
two
and
then
rushed
after
nelly
just
in
time
to
run
against
miss
abigail
who
entered
the
room
with
a
couple
of
lighted
candles
goodness
gracious
tom
exclaimed
miss
abigail
are
you
possessed
i
left
her
scraping
the
warm
spermaceti
from
one
of
her
thumbs
nelly
was
in
the
kitchen
talking
quite
unconcernedly
with
kitty
collins
there
she
remained
until
supper
over
we
all
adjourned
to
the
i
planned
and
plotted
but
could
manage
in
no
way
to
get
nelly
alone
she
and
the
captain
played
cribbage
all
the
evening
the
next
morning
my
lady
did
not
make
her
appearance
until
we
were
seated
at
the
i
had
got
up
at
daylight
myself
immediately
after
breakfast
the
carriage
arrived
to
take
her
to
the
railway
station
a
gentleman
stepped
from
this
carriage
and
greatly
to
my
surprise
was
warmly
welcomed
by
the
captain
and
miss
abigail
and
by
miss
nelly
herself
who
seemed
unnecessarily
glad
to
see
him
from
the
hasty
conversation
that
followed
i
learned
that
the
gentleman
had
come
somewhat
unexpectedly
to
conduct
miss
nelly
to
boston
but
how
did
he
know
that
she
was
to
leave
that
morning
nelly
bade
farewell
to
the
captain
and
miss
abigail
made
a
little
rush
and
kissed
me
on
the
nose
and
was
gone
as
the
wheels
of
the
hack
rolled
up
the
street
and
over
my
finer
feelings
i
turned
to
the
captain
who
was
that
gentleman
sir
that
was
a
relation
of
yours
sir
i
asked
craftily
no
relation
of
mine
a
relation
of
nelly
said
the
captain
smiling
a
cousin
i
suggested
feeling
a
strange
hatred
spring
up
in
my
bosom
for
the
unknown
well
i
suppose
you
might
call
him
a
cousin
for
the
present
he
going
to
marry
little
nelly
next
in
one
of
peter
parley
valuable
historical
works
is
a
description
of
an
earthquake
at
lisbon
at
the
first
shock
the
inhabitants
rushed
into
the
streets
the
earth
yawned
at
their
feet
and
the
houses
tottered
and
fell
on
every
i
staggered
past
the
captain
into
the
street
a
giddiness
came
over
me
the
earth
yawned
at
my
feet
and
the
houses
threatened
to
fall
in
on
every
side
of
me
how
distinctly
i
remember
that
momentary
sense
of
confusion
when
everything
in
the
world
seemed
toppling
over
into
ruins
as
i
have
remarked
my
love
for
nelly
is
a
thing
of
the
past
i
had
not
thought
of
her
for
years
until
i
sat
down
to
write
this
chapter
and
yet
now
that
all
is
said
and
done
i
should
care
particularly
to
come
across
waldron
eldest
boy
in
my
afternoon
walk
he
must
be
fourteen
or
fifteen
years
old
by
this
time
the
young
villain
chapter
nineteen
i
become
a
blighted
being
when
a
young
boy
gets
to
be
an
old
boy
when
the
hair
is
growing
rather
thin
on
the
top
of
the
old
boy
head
and
he
has
been
tamed
sufficiently
to
take
a
sort
of
chastened
pleasure
in
allowing
the
baby
to
play
with
his
when
i
say
an
old
boy
has
reached
this
stage
in
the
journey
of
life
he
is
sometimes
apt
to
indulge
in
sportive
remarks
concerning
his
first
love
now
though
i
bless
my
stars
that
it
was
in
my
power
to
marry
miss
nelly
i
am
not
going
to
deny
my
boyish
regard
for
her
nor
laugh
at
it
as
long
as
it
lasted
it
was
a
very
sincere
and
unselfish
love
and
rendered
me
proportionately
wretched
i
say
as
long
as
it
lasted
for
one
first
love
does
last
forever
i
am
ready
however
to
laugh
at
the
amusing
figure
i
cut
after
i
had
really
ceased
to
have
any
deep
feeling
in
the
matter
it
was
then
i
took
it
into
my
head
to
be
a
blighted
being
this
was
about
two
weeks
after
the
spectral
appearance
of
waldron
for
a
boy
of
a
naturally
vivacious
disposition
the
part
of
a
blighted
being
presented
difficulties
i
had
an
excellent
appetite
i
liked
society
i
liked
sports
i
was
fond
of
handsome
clothes
now
all
these
things
were
incompatible
with
the
doleful
character
i
was
to
assume
and
i
proceeded
to
cast
them
from
me
i
neglected
my
hair
i
avoided
my
playmates
i
frowned
abstractedly
i
did
eat
as
much
as
was
good
for
me
i
took
lonely
walks
i
brooded
in
solitude
i
not
only
committed
to
memory
the
more
turgid
poems
of
the
late
lord
byron
fare
thee
well
and
if
forever
but
i
became
a
despondent
poet
on
my
own
account
and
composed
a
string
of
stanzas
to
one
who
will
understand
i
think
i
was
a
trifle
too
hopeful
on
that
point
for
i
came
across
the
verses
several
years
afterwards
and
was
quite
unable
to
understand
them
myself
it
was
a
great
comfort
to
be
so
perfectly
miserable
and
yet
not
suffer
any
i
used
to
look
in
the
glass
and
gloat
over
the
amount
and
variety
of
mournful
expression
i
could
throw
into
my
features
if
i
caught
myself
smiling
at
anything
i
cut
the
smile
short
with
a
sigh
the
oddest
thing
about
all
this
is
i
never
once
suspected
that
i
was
not
unhappy
no
one
not
even
pepper
whitcomb
was
more
deceived
than
i
among
the
minor
pleasures
of
being
blighted
were
the
interest
and
perplexity
i
excited
in
the
simple
souls
that
were
thrown
in
daily
contact
with
me
pepper
especially
i
nearly
drove
him
into
a
corresponding
state
of
mind
i
had
from
time
to
time
given
pepper
slight
but
impressive
hints
of
my
admiration
for
some
one
this
was
in
the
early
part
of
miss
visit
i
had
also
led
him
to
infer
that
my
admiration
was
not
altogether
in
vain
he
was
therefore
unable
to
explain
the
cause
of
my
strange
behavior
for
i
had
carefully
refrained
from
mentioning
to
pepper
the
fact
that
some
one
had
turned
out
to
be
another
i
treated
pepper
shabbily
i
could
resist
playing
on
his
tenderer
feelings
he
was
a
boy
bubbling
over
with
sympathy
for
anyone
in
any
kind
of
trouble
our
intimacy
since
binny
wallace
death
had
been
uninterrupted
but
now
i
moved
in
a
sphere
apart
not
to
be
profaned
by
the
step
of
an
outsider
i
no
longer
joined
the
boys
on
the
playground
at
recess
i
stayed
at
my
desk
reading
some
lugubrious
volume
usually
the
mysteries
of
udolpho
by
the
amiable
radcliffe
a
translation
of
the
sorrows
of
werter
fell
into
my
hands
at
this
period
and
if
i
could
have
committed
suicide
without
killing
myself
i
should
certainly
have
done
so
on
instead
of
fraternizing
with
pepper
and
the
rest
of
our
clique
i
would
wander
off
alone
to
grave
point
grave
point
the
place
where
binny
wallace
body
came
ashore
was
a
narrow
strip
of
land
running
out
into
the
river
a
line
of
lombardy
poplars
stiff
and
severe
like
a
row
of
grenadiers
mounted
guard
on
the
on
the
extreme
end
of
the
peninsula
was
an
old
disused
graveyard
tenanted
principally
by
the
early
settlers
who
had
been
scalped
by
the
indians
in
a
remote
corner
of
the
cemetery
set
apart
from
the
other
mounds
was
the
grave
of
a
woman
who
had
been
hanged
in
the
old
colonial
times
for
the
murder
of
her
infant
goodwife
polly
haines
had
denied
the
crime
to
the
last
and
after
her
death
there
had
arisen
strong
doubts
as
to
her
actual
guilt
it
was
a
belief
current
among
the
lads
of
the
town
that
if
you
went
to
this
grave
at
nightfall
on
the
of
november
the
anniversary
of
her
execution
and
asked
for
what
did
the
magistrates
hang
you
a
voice
would
reply
many
a
rivermouth
boy
has
tremblingly
put
this
question
in
the
dark
and
sure
enough
polly
haines
invariably
answered
nothing
a
low
wall
broken
down
in
many
places
and
frosted
over
with
silvery
moss
surrounded
this
of
our
pilgrim
fathers
and
their
immediate
descendants
the
latest
date
on
any
of
the
headstones
was
a
crop
of
very
funny
epitaphs
sprung
up
here
and
there
among
the
overgrown
thistles
and
burdocks
and
almost
every
tablet
had
a
with
engraved
upon
it
or
else
a
puffy
round
face
with
a
pair
of
wings
stretching
out
from
the
ears
like
this
cherub
graphic
these
mortuary
emblems
furnished
me
with
congenial
food
for
reflection
i
used
to
lie
in
the
long
grass
and
speculate
on
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
being
a
cherub
i
forget
what
i
thought
the
advantages
were
but
i
remember
distinctly
of
getting
into
an
inextricable
tangle
on
two
points
how
could
a
cherub
being
all
head
and
wings
manage
to
sit
down
when
he
was
tired
to
have
to
sit
down
on
the
back
of
his
head
struck
me
as
an
awkward
alternative
again
where
did
a
cherub
carry
those
indispensable
articles
such
as
marbles
and
pieces
of
twine
which
boys
in
an
earthly
state
of
existence
usually
stow
away
in
their
these
were
knotty
questions
and
i
was
never
able
to
dispose
of
them
satisfactorily
meanwhile
pepper
whitcomb
would
scour
the
whole
town
in
search
of
me
he
finally
discovered
my
retreat
and
dropped
in
on
me
abruptly
one
afternoon
while
i
was
deep
in
the
cherub
problem
look
here
tom
bailey
said
pepper
shying
a
piece
of
indignantly
at
the
file
jacet
on
a
neighboring
gravestone
you
are
just
going
to
the
dogs
ca
you
tell
a
fellow
what
in
thunder
ails
you
instead
of
prowling
round
among
the
tombs
like
a
jolly
old
vampire
pepper
i
replied
solemnly
do
ask
me
all
is
not
well
here
touching
my
breast
mysteriously
if
i
had
touched
my
head
instead
i
should
have
been
nearer
the
mark
pepper
stared
at
me
earthly
happiness
i
continued
is
a
delusion
and
a
snare
you
will
never
be
happy
pepper
until
you
are
a
pepper
by
the
by
would
have
made
an
excellent
cherub
he
was
so
chubby
having
delivered
myself
of
these
gloomy
remarks
i
arose
languidly
from
the
grass
and
moved
away
leaving
pepper
staring
after
me
in
mute
astonishment
i
was
hamlet
and
werter
and
the
late
lord
byron
all
in
one
you
will
ask
what
my
purpose
was
in
cultivating
this
factitious
despondency
none
whatever
blighted
beings
never
have
any
purpose
in
life
excepting
to
be
as
blighted
as
possible
of
course
my
present
line
of
business
could
not
long
escape
the
eye
of
captain
nutter
i
do
know
if
the
captain
suspected
my
attachment
for
miss
glentworth
he
never
alluded
to
it
but
he
watched
me
miss
abigail
watched
me
kitty
collins
watched
me
and
sailor
ben
watched
me
i
ca
make
out
his
signals
i
overheard
the
admiral
remark
to
my
grandfather
one
day
i
hope
he
ai
got
no
kind
of
sickness
there
was
something
singularly
agreeable
in
being
an
object
of
so
great
interest
sometimes
i
had
all
i
could
do
to
preserve
my
dejected
aspect
it
was
so
pleasant
to
be
miserable
i
incline
to
the
opinion
that
people
who
are
melancholy
without
any
particular
reason
such
as
poets
artists
and
young
musicians
with
long
hair
have
rather
an
enviable
time
of
it
in
a
quiet
way
i
never
enjoyed
myself
better
in
my
life
than
when
i
was
a
blighted
being
chapter
twenty
i
prove
myself
to
be
the
grandson
of
my
grandfather
it
was
not
possible
for
a
boy
of
my
temperament
to
be
a
blighted
being
longer
than
three
consecutive
weeks
i
was
gradually
emerging
from
my
cloud
when
events
took
place
that
greatly
assisted
in
restoring
me
to
a
more
natural
frame
of
mind
i
awoke
from
an
imaginary
trouble
to
face
a
real
one
i
suppose
you
do
know
what
a
financial
crisis
is
i
will
give
you
an
illustration
you
are
deeply
in
debt
say
to
the
amount
of
a
quarter
of
a
dollar
to
the
little
knicknack
shop
round
the
corner
where
they
sell
needles
and
malaga
raisins
a
boy
owes
you
a
quarter
of
a
dollar
which
he
promises
to
pay
at
a
certain
time
you
are
depending
on
this
quarter
to
settle
accounts
with
the
small
the
time
arrives
and
the
quarter
does
that
a
financial
crisis
in
one
sense
senses
if
i
may
say
so
when
this
same
thing
happens
on
a
grander
scale
in
the
mercantile
world
it
produces
what
is
called
a
panic
one
man
inability
to
pay
his
debts
ruins
another
man
who
in
turn
ruins
someone
else
and
so
on
until
failure
after
failure
makes
even
the
richest
capitalists
tremble
public
confidence
is
suspended
and
the
smaller
fry
of
merchants
are
knocked
over
like
tenpins
these
commercial
panics
occur
periodically
after
the
fashion
of
comets
and
earthquakes
and
other
disagreeable
things
such
a
panic
took
place
in
new
orleans
in
the
year
and
my
went
to
pieces
in
the
crash
of
a
comparatively
large
fortune
nothing
remained
after
paying
his
debts
excepting
a
few
thousand
dollars
with
which
he
proposed
to
return
north
and
embark
in
some
less
hazardous
enterprise
in
the
meantime
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
stay
in
new
orleans
to
wind
up
the
business
my
grandfather
was
in
some
way
involved
in
this
failure
and
lost
i
fancy
a
considerable
sum
of
money
but
he
never
talked
much
on
the
subject
he
was
an
unflinching
believer
in
the
proverb
it
ca
be
gathered
up
he
would
say
and
it
no
use
crying
over
it
pitch
into
the
cow
and
get
some
more
milk
is
my
the
suspension
of
the
was
bad
enough
but
there
was
an
attending
circumstance
that
gave
us
at
rivermouth
a
great
deal
more
anxiety
the
cholera
which
someone
predicted
would
visit
the
country
that
year
and
which
indeed
had
made
its
appearance
in
a
mild
form
at
several
points
along
the
mississippi
river
had
broken
out
with
much
violence
at
new
orleans
the
report
that
first
reached
us
through
the
newspapers
was
meagre
and
contradictory
many
people
discredited
it
but
a
letter
from
my
mother
left
us
no
room
for
doubt
the
sickness
was
in
the
city
the
hospitals
were
filling
up
and
hundreds
of
the
citizens
were
flying
from
the
stricken
place
by
every
steamboat
the
unsettled
state
of
my
affairs
made
it
imperative
for
him
to
remain
at
his
post
his
desertion
at
that
moment
would
have
been
at
the
sacrifice
of
all
he
had
saved
from
the
general
wreck
as
he
would
be
detained
in
new
orleans
at
least
three
months
my
mother
declined
to
come
north
without
him
after
this
we
awaited
with
feverish
impatience
the
weekly
news
that
came
to
us
from
the
south
the
next
letter
advised
us
that
my
parents
were
well
and
that
the
sickness
so
far
had
not
penetrated
to
the
faubourg
or
district
where
they
lived
the
following
week
brought
less
cheering
tidings
my
father
business
in
consequence
of
the
flight
of
the
other
partners
would
keep
him
in
the
city
beyond
the
period
he
had
mentioned
the
family
had
moved
to
pass
christian
a
favorite
on
lake
pontchartrain
near
new
orleans
where
he
was
able
to
spend
part
of
each
week
so
the
return
north
was
postponed
indefinitely
it
was
now
that
the
old
longing
to
see
my
parents
came
back
to
me
with
irresistible
force
i
knew
my
grandfather
would
not
listen
to
the
idea
of
my
going
to
new
orleans
at
such
a
dangerous
time
since
he
had
opposed
the
journey
so
strongly
when
the
same
objection
did
not
exist
but
i
determined
to
go
nevertheless
i
think
i
have
mentioned
the
fact
that
all
the
male
members
of
our
family
on
my
father
side
as
far
back
as
the
middle
ages
have
exhibited
in
early
youth
a
decided
talent
for
running
away
it
was
an
hereditary
talent
it
ran
in
the
blood
to
run
away
i
do
not
pretend
to
explain
the
peculiarity
i
simply
admit
it
it
was
not
my
fate
to
change
the
prescribed
order
of
things
i
too
was
to
run
away
thereby
proving
if
any
proof
were
needed
that
i
was
the
grandson
of
my
grandfather
i
do
not
hold
myself
responsible
for
the
step
any
more
than
i
do
for
the
shape
of
my
nose
which
is
said
to
be
a
facsimile
of
captain
nutter
i
have
frequently
noticed
how
circumstances
conspire
to
help
a
man
or
a
boy
when
he
has
thoroughly
resolved
on
doing
a
thing
that
very
week
the
rivermouth
barnacle
printed
an
advertisement
that
seemed
to
have
been
written
on
purpose
for
me
it
read
as
follows
wanted
a
few
seamen
and
a
for
the
ship
rawlings
now
loading
for
new
orleans
at
johnson
wharf
boston
apply
in
person
within
four
days
at
the
office
of
or
on
board
the
ship
how
i
was
to
get
to
new
orleans
with
only
was
a
question
that
had
been
bothering
me
this
advertisement
made
it
as
clear
as
day
i
would
go
as
i
had
taken
pepper
into
my
confidence
again
i
had
told
him
the
story
of
my
love
for
miss
glentworth
with
all
its
harrowing
details
and
now
conceived
it
judicious
to
confide
in
him
the
change
about
to
take
place
in
my
life
so
that
if
the
rawlings
went
down
in
a
gale
my
friends
might
have
the
limited
satisfaction
of
knowing
what
had
become
of
me
pepper
shook
his
head
discouragingly
and
sought
in
every
way
to
dissuade
me
from
the
step
he
drew
a
disenchanting
picture
of
the
existence
of
a
whose
constant
duty
according
to
pepper
was
to
have
dishes
broken
over
his
head
whenever
the
captain
or
the
mate
chanced
to
be
out
of
humor
which
was
mostly
all
the
time
but
nothing
pepper
said
could
turn
me
a
from
my
purpose
i
had
little
time
to
spare
for
the
advertisement
stated
explicitly
that
applications
were
to
be
made
in
person
within
four
days
i
trembled
to
think
of
the
bare
possibility
of
some
other
boy
snapping
up
that
desirable
situation
it
was
on
monday
that
i
stumbled
upon
the
advertisement
on
tuesday
my
preparations
were
completed
my
baggage
consisting
of
four
shirts
half
a
dozen
collars
a
piece
of
shoemaker
wax
heaven
knows
what
for
and
seven
stockings
wrapped
in
a
silk
handkerchief
lay
hidden
under
a
loose
plank
of
the
stable
floor
this
was
my
point
of
departure
my
plan
was
to
take
the
last
train
for
boston
in
order
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
immediate
pursuit
if
any
should
be
attempted
the
train
left
at
i
ate
no
breakfast
and
little
dinner
that
day
i
avoided
the
eye
and
would
have
looked
miss
abigail
or
kitty
in
the
face
for
the
wealth
of
the
indies
when
it
was
time
to
start
for
the
station
i
retired
quietly
to
the
stable
and
uncovered
my
bundle
i
lingered
a
moment
to
kiss
the
white
star
on
gypsy
forehead
and
was
nearly
unmanned
when
the
little
animal
returned
the
caress
by
lapping
my
cheek
twice
i
went
back
and
patted
her
on
reaching
the
station
i
purchased
my
ticket
with
a
bravado
air
that
ought
to
have
aroused
the
suspicion
of
the
and
hurried
to
the
car
where
i
sat
fidgeting
until
the
train
shot
out
into
the
broad
daylight
then
i
drew
a
long
breath
and
looked
about
me
the
first
object
that
saluted
my
sight
was
sailor
ben
four
or
five
seats
behind
me
reading
the
rivermouth
barnacle
reading
was
not
an
easy
art
to
sailor
ben
he
grappled
with
the
sense
of
a
paragraph
as
if
it
were
a
and
generally
got
the
worst
of
it
on
the
present
occasion
he
was
having
a
hard
struggle
judging
by
the
way
he
worked
his
mouth
and
rolled
his
eyes
he
had
evidently
not
seen
me
but
what
was
he
doing
on
the
boston
train
without
lingering
to
solve
the
question
i
stole
gently
from
my
seat
and
passed
into
the
forward
car
this
was
very
awkward
having
the
admiral
on
board
i
understand
it
at
all
could
it
be
possible
that
the
old
boy
had
got
tired
of
land
and
was
running
away
to
sea
himself
that
was
too
absurd
i
glanced
nervously
towards
the
car
door
now
and
then
half
expecting
to
see
him
come
after
me
we
had
passed
one
or
two
and
i
had
quieted
down
a
good
deal
when
i
began
to
feel
as
if
somebody
was
looking
steadily
at
the
back
of
my
head
i
turned
round
involuntarily
and
there
was
sailor
ben
again
at
the
farther
end
of
the
car
wrestling
with
the
rivermouth
barnacle
as
before
i
began
to
grow
very
uncomfortable
indeed
was
it
by
design
or
chance
that
he
thus
dogged
my
steps
if
he
was
aware
of
my
presence
why
he
speak
to
me
at
once
did
he
steal
round
making
no
sign
like
a
particularly
unpleasant
phantom
maybe
it
was
sailor
ben
i
peeped
at
him
slyly
there
was
no
mistaking
that
tanned
genial
phiz
of
his
very
odd
he
did
see
me
literature
even
in
the
mild
form
of
a
country
newspaper
always
had
the
effect
of
poppies
on
the
admiral
i
stole
another
glance
in
his
direction
his
hat
was
tilted
over
his
right
eye
in
the
most
dissolute
style
and
the
rivermouth
barnacle
lay
in
a
confused
heap
beside
him
he
had
succumbed
he
was
fast
asleep
if
he
would
only
keep
asleep
until
we
reached
our
destination
by
and
by
i
discovered
that
the
rear
car
had
been
detached
from
the
train
at
the
last
this
accounted
satisfactorily
for
sailor
ben
singular
movements
and
considerably
calmed
my
fears
nevertheless
i
did
not
like
the
aspect
of
things
the
admiral
continued
to
snooze
like
a
good
fellow
and
was
snoring
melodiously
as
we
glided
at
a
slackened
pace
over
a
bridge
and
into
boston
i
grasped
my
pilgrim
bundle
and
hurrying
out
of
the
car
dashed
up
the
first
street
that
presented
itself
it
was
a
narrow
noisy
zigzag
street
crowded
with
trucks
and
obstructed
with
bales
and
boxes
of
merchandise
i
did
pause
to
breathe
until
i
had
placed
a
respectable
distance
between
me
and
the
railway
station
by
this
time
it
was
nearly
twilight
i
had
got
into
the
region
of
and
was
about
to
seat
myself
on
a
doorstep
to
rest
when
lo
there
was
the
admiral
trundling
along
on
the
opposite
sidewalk
under
a
full
spread
of
canvas
as
he
would
have
expressed
it
i
was
off
again
in
an
instant
at
a
rapid
pace
but
in
spite
of
all
i
could
do
he
held
his
own
without
any
perceptible
exertion
he
had
a
very
ugly
gait
to
get
away
from
the
admiral
i
did
dare
to
run
for
fear
of
being
mistaken
for
a
thief
a
suspicion
which
my
bundle
would
naturally
lend
color
to
i
pushed
ahead
however
at
a
brisk
trot
and
must
have
got
over
one
or
two
miles
my
pursuer
neither
gaining
nor
losing
ground
when
i
concluded
to
surrender
at
discretion
i
saw
that
sailor
ben
was
determined
to
have
me
and
knowing
my
man
i
knew
that
escape
was
highly
improbable
so
i
turned
round
and
waited
for
him
to
catch
up
with
me
which
he
did
in
a
few
seconds
looking
rather
sheepish
at
first
sailor
ben
said
i
severely
do
i
understand
that
you
are
dogging
my
steps
little
replied
the
admiral
rubbing
his
nose
which
he
always
did
when
he
was
disconcerted
i
am
kind
o
followin
in
your
under
orders
under
under
the
captain
orders
in
other
words
my
grandfather
has
sent
you
to
fetch
me
back
to
rivermouth
that
about
it
said
the
admiral
with
a
burst
of
frankness
and
i
must
go
with
you
whether
i
want
to
or
not
the
capen
very
identical
words
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
i
bit
my
lips
with
suppressed
anger
and
signified
that
i
was
at
his
disposal
since
i
could
help
it
the
impression
was
very
strong
in
my
mind
that
the
admiral
would
hesitate
to
put
me
in
irons
if
i
showed
signs
of
mutiny
it
was
too
late
to
return
to
rivermouth
that
night
a
fact
which
i
communicated
to
the
old
boy
sullenly
inquiring
at
the
same
time
what
he
proposed
to
do
about
it
he
said
we
would
cruise
about
for
some
rations
and
then
make
a
night
of
it
i
did
condescend
to
reply
though
i
hailed
the
suggestion
of
something
to
eat
with
inward
enthusiasm
for
i
had
not
taken
enough
food
that
day
to
keep
life
in
a
canary
wandered
back
to
the
railway
station
in
the
waiting
room
of
which
was
a
kind
of
restaurant
presided
over
by
a
young
lady
here
we
had
a
cup
of
coffee
apiece
several
tough
doughnuts
and
some
blocks
of
venerable
spongecake
the
young
lady
who
attended
on
us
whatever
her
age
was
then
must
have
been
a
mere
child
when
that
was
made
the
admiral
acquaintance
with
boston
hotels
was
slight
but
he
knew
of
a
quiet
near
by
much
patronized
by
and
kept
by
a
former
friend
of
his
in
this
house
which
had
seen
its
best
days
we
were
accommodated
with
a
mouldy
chamber
containing
two
two
chairs
and
a
cracked
pitcher
on
a
washstand
the
was
ornamented
with
three
big
pink
resembling
pieces
of
petrified
liver
and
over
these
hung
a
cheap
lurid
print
in
which
a
united
states
was
giving
a
british
frigate
particular
fits
it
is
very
strange
how
our
own
ships
never
seem
to
suffer
any
in
these
terrible
engagements
it
shows
what
a
nation
we
are
an
on
a
cast
a
dismal
glare
over
the
apartment
which
was
cheerless
in
the
extreme
i
thought
of
our
at
home
with
its
flowery
and
gay
curtains
and
soft
lounges
i
saw
major
elkanah
nutter
my
grandfather
father
in
powdered
wig
and
federal
uniform
looking
down
benevolently
from
his
gilt
frame
between
the
bookcases
i
pictured
the
captain
and
miss
abigail
sitting
at
the
cosey
round
table
in
the
glow
of
the
astral
lamp
and
then
i
fell
to
wondering
how
they
would
receive
me
when
i
came
back
i
wondered
if
the
prodigal
son
had
any
idea
that
his
father
was
going
to
kill
the
fatted
calf
for
him
and
how
he
felt
about
it
on
the
whole
though
i
was
very
low
in
spirits
i
put
on
a
bold
front
to
sailor
ben
you
will
understand
to
be
caught
and
caged
in
this
manner
was
a
frightful
shock
to
my
vanity
he
tried
to
draw
me
into
conversation
but
i
answered
in
icy
monosyllables
he
again
suggested
we
should
make
a
night
of
it
and
hinted
broadly
that
he
was
game
for
any
amount
of
riotous
dissipation
even
to
the
extent
of
going
to
see
a
play
if
i
wanted
to
i
declined
haughtily
i
was
dying
to
go
he
then
threw
out
a
feeler
on
the
subject
of
dominos
and
checkers
and
observed
in
a
general
way
that
seven
up
was
a
capital
game
but
i
repulsed
him
at
every
point
i
saw
that
the
admiral
was
beginning
to
feel
hurt
by
my
systematic
coldness
had
always
been
such
hearty
friends
until
now
it
was
too
bad
of
me
to
fret
that
tender
honest
old
heart
even
for
an
hour
i
really
did
love
the
ancient
boy
and
when
in
a
disconsolate
way
he
ordered
up
a
pitcher
of
beer
i
unbent
so
far
as
to
partake
of
some
in
a
teacup
he
recovered
his
spirits
instantly
and
took
out
his
cuddy
clay
pipe
for
a
smoke
between
the
beer
and
the
soothing
fragrance
of
the
i
fell
into
a
pleasanter
mood
myself
and
it
being
too
late
now
to
go
to
the
theatre
i
condescended
to
say
addressing
the
northwest
corner
of
the
ceiling
that
seven
up
was
a
capital
game
upon
this
hint
the
admiral
disappeared
and
returned
shortly
with
a
very
dirty
pack
of
cards
as
we
played
with
varying
fortunes
by
the
flickering
flame
of
the
lamp
he
sipped
his
beer
and
became
communicative
he
seemed
immensely
tickled
by
the
fact
that
i
had
come
to
boston
it
leaked
out
presently
that
he
and
the
captain
had
had
a
wager
on
the
subject
the
discovery
of
my
plans
and
who
had
discovered
them
were
points
on
which
the
admiral
refused
to
throw
any
light
they
had
been
discovered
however
and
the
captain
had
laughed
at
the
idea
of
my
running
away
sailor
ben
on
the
contrary
had
stoutly
contended
that
i
meant
to
slip
cable
and
be
off
whereupon
the
captain
offered
to
bet
him
a
dollar
that
i
would
go
and
it
was
partly
on
account
of
this
wager
that
sailor
ben
refrained
from
capturing
me
when
he
might
have
done
so
at
the
start
now
as
the
fare
to
and
from
boston
with
the
lodging
expenses
would
cost
him
at
least
five
dollars
i
did
see
what
he
gained
by
winning
the
wager
the
admiral
rubbed
his
nose
violently
when
this
view
of
the
case
presented
itself
i
asked
him
why
he
did
take
me
from
the
train
at
the
first
and
return
to
rivermouth
by
the
down
train
at
he
explained
having
purchased
a
ticket
for
boston
he
considered
himself
bound
to
the
owners
the
stockholders
of
the
road
to
fulfil
his
part
of
the
contract
to
use
his
own
words
he
had
shipped
for
the
this
struck
me
as
being
so
deliciously
funny
that
after
i
was
in
bed
and
the
light
was
out
i
could
help
laughing
aloud
once
or
twice
i
suppose
the
admiral
must
have
thought
i
was
meditating
another
escape
for
he
made
periodical
visits
to
my
bed
throughout
the
night
satisfying
himself
by
kneading
me
all
over
that
i
had
evaporated
i
was
all
there
the
next
morning
when
sailor
ben
half
awakened
me
by
shouting
merrily
all
hands
on
deck
the
words
rang
in
my
ears
like
a
part
of
my
own
dream
for
i
was
at
that
instant
climbing
up
the
side
of
the
rawlings
to
offer
myself
as
the
admiral
was
obliged
to
shake
me
roughly
two
or
three
times
before
he
could
detach
me
from
the
dream
i
opened
my
eyes
with
effort
and
stared
stupidly
round
the
room
bit
by
bit
my
real
situation
dawned
on
me
a
sickening
sensation
that
is
when
one
is
in
trouble
to
wake
up
feeling
free
for
a
moment
and
then
to
find
yesterday
sorrow
all
ready
to
go
on
again
little
messmate
how
fares
it
i
was
too
much
depressed
to
reply
the
thought
of
returning
to
rivermouth
chilled
me
how
could
i
face
captain
nutter
to
say
nothing
of
miss
abigail
and
kitty
how
the
temple
grammar
school
boys
would
look
at
me
how
conway
and
seth
rodgers
would
exult
over
my
mortification
and
what
if
the
rev
wibird
hawkins
should
allude
to
me
in
his
next
sunday
sermon
sailor
ben
was
wise
in
keeping
an
eye
on
me
for
after
these
thoughts
took
possession
of
my
mind
i
wanted
only
the
opportunity
to
give
him
the
slip
the
keeper
of
the
lodgings
did
not
supply
meals
to
his
guests
so
we
breakfasted
at
a
small
chophouse
in
a
crooked
street
on
our
way
to
the
cars
the
city
was
not
astir
yet
and
looked
glum
and
careworn
in
the
damp
morning
atmosphere
here
and
there
as
we
passed
along
was
a
taking
down
shutters
and
now
and
then
we
met
a
seedy
man
who
had
evidently
spent
the
night
in
a
doorway
such
early
birds
and
a
few
laborers
with
their
tin
kettles
were
the
only
signs
of
life
to
be
seen
until
we
came
to
the
station
where
i
insisted
on
paying
for
my
own
ticket
i
did
relish
being
conveyed
from
place
to
place
like
a
felon
changing
prisons
at
somebody
else
expense
on
entering
the
car
i
sunk
into
a
seat
next
the
window
and
sailor
ben
deposited
himself
beside
me
cutting
off
all
chance
of
escape
the
car
filled
up
soon
after
this
and
i
wondered
if
there
was
anything
in
my
mien
that
would
lead
the
other
passengers
to
suspect
i
was
a
boy
who
had
run
away
and
was
being
brought
back
a
man
in
front
of
us
he
was
as
i
discovered
later
by
his
reading
a
with
his
nose
brought
the
blood
to
my
cheeks
by
turning
round
and
peering
at
me
steadily
i
rubbed
a
clear
spot
on
the
cloudy
at
my
elbow
and
looked
out
to
avoid
him
there
in
the
travellers
room
was
the
young
lady
piling
up
her
blocks
of
in
alluring
pyramids
and
industriously
intrenching
herself
behind
a
breastwork
of
i
saw
with
cynical
pleasure
numerous
victims
walk
up
to
the
counter
and
recklessly
sow
the
seeds
of
death
in
their
constitutions
by
eating
her
doughnuts
i
had
got
quite
interested
in
her
when
the
whistle
sounded
and
the
train
began
to
move
the
admiral
and
i
did
not
talk
much
on
the
journey
i
stared
out
of
the
window
most
of
the
time
speculating
as
to
the
probable
nature
of
the
reception
in
store
for
me
at
the
terminus
of
the
road
would
the
captain
say
and
grimshaw
what
would
he
do
about
it
then
i
thought
of
pepper
whitcomb
dire
was
the
vengeance
i
meant
to
wreak
on
pepper
for
who
but
he
had
betrayed
me
pepper
alone
had
been
the
repository
of
my
secret
perfidious
pepper
as
we
left
station
after
station
behind
us
i
felt
less
and
less
like
encountering
the
members
of
our
family
sailor
ben
fathomed
what
was
passing
in
my
mind
for
he
leaned
over
and
said
i
do
think
as
the
capen
will
bear
down
very
hard
on
but
it
was
that
it
was
the
fear
of
any
physical
punishment
that
might
be
inflicted
it
was
a
sense
of
my
own
folly
that
was
creeping
over
me
for
during
the
long
silent
ride
i
had
examined
my
conduct
from
every
and
there
was
no
view
i
could
take
of
myself
in
which
i
did
not
look
like
a
very
foolish
person
indeed
as
we
came
within
sight
of
the
spires
of
rivermouth
i
would
have
cared
if
the
up
train
which
met
us
outside
the
town
had
run
into
us
and
ended
me
contrary
to
my
expectation
and
dread
the
captain
was
not
visible
when
we
stepped
from
the
cars
sailor
ben
glanced
among
the
crowd
of
faces
apparently
looking
for
him
too
conway
was
there
he
was
always
hanging
about
the
station
and
if
he
had
intimated
in
any
way
that
he
knew
of
my
disgrace
and
enjoyed
it
i
should
have
walked
into
him
i
am
certain
but
this
defiant
feeling
entirely
deserted
me
by
the
time
we
reached
the
nutter
house
the
captain
himself
opened
the
door
come
on
board
sir
said
sailor
ben
scraping
his
left
foot
and
touching
his
hat
my
grandfather
nodded
to
sailor
ben
somewhat
coldly
i
thought
and
much
to
my
astonishment
kindly
took
me
by
the
hand
i
was
unprepared
for
this
and
the
tears
which
no
amount
of
severity
would
have
wrung
from
me
welled
up
to
my
eyes
the
expression
of
my
grandfather
face
as
i
glanced
at
it
hastily
was
grave
and
gentle
there
was
nothing
in
it
of
anger
or
reproof
i
followed
him
into
the
and
obeying
a
motion
of
his
hand
seated
myself
on
the
sofa
he
remained
standing
by
the
round
table
for
a
moment
lost
in
thought
then
leaned
over
and
picked
up
a
letter
it
was
a
letter
with
a
great
black
seal
chapter
in
which
i
leave
rivermouth
a
letter
with
a
great
black
seal
i
knew
then
what
had
happened
as
well
as
i
know
it
now
but
which
was
it
father
or
mother
i
do
not
like
to
look
back
to
the
agony
and
suspense
of
that
moment
my
father
had
died
at
new
orleans
during
one
of
his
weekly
visits
to
the
city
the
letter
bearing
these
tidings
had
reached
rivermouth
the
evening
of
my
flight
had
passed
me
on
the
road
by
the
down
train
i
must
turn
back
for
a
moment
to
that
eventful
evening
when
i
failed
to
make
my
appearance
at
supper
the
captain
began
to
suspect
that
i
had
really
started
on
my
wild
tour
southward
a
conjecture
which
sailor
absence
helped
to
confirm
i
had
evidently
got
off
by
the
train
and
sailor
ben
had
followed
me
there
was
no
telegraphic
communication
between
boston
and
rivermouth
in
those
days
so
my
grandfather
could
do
nothing
but
await
the
result
even
if
there
had
been
another
mail
to
boston
he
could
not
have
availed
himself
of
it
not
knowing
how
to
address
a
message
to
the
fugitives
the
was
naturally
the
last
place
either
i
or
the
admiral
would
think
of
visiting
my
grandfather
however
was
too
full
of
trouble
to
allow
this
to
add
to
his
distress
he
knew
that
the
faithful
old
sailor
would
not
let
me
come
to
any
harm
and
even
if
i
had
managed
for
the
time
being
to
elude
him
was
sure
to
bring
me
back
sooner
or
later
our
return
therefore
by
the
first
train
on
the
following
day
did
not
surprise
him
i
was
greatly
puzzled
as
i
have
said
by
the
gentle
manner
of
his
reception
but
when
we
were
alone
together
in
the
and
he
began
slowly
to
unfold
the
letter
i
understood
it
all
i
caught
a
sight
of
my
mother
handwriting
in
the
superscription
and
there
was
nothing
left
to
tell
me
my
grandfather
held
the
letter
a
few
seconds
irresolutely
and
then
commenced
reading
it
aloud
but
he
could
get
no
further
than
the
date
i
ca
read
it
tom
said
the
old
gentleman
breaking
down
i
thought
i
he
handed
it
to
me
i
took
the
letter
mechanically
and
hurried
away
with
it
to
my
little
room
where
i
had
passed
so
many
happy
hours
the
week
that
followed
the
receipt
of
this
letter
is
nearly
a
blank
in
my
memory
i
remember
that
the
days
appeared
endless
that
at
times
i
could
not
realize
the
misfortune
that
had
befallen
us
and
my
heart
upbraided
me
for
not
feeling
a
deeper
grief
that
a
full
sense
of
my
loss
would
now
and
then
sweep
over
me
like
an
inspiration
and
i
would
steal
away
to
my
chamber
or
wander
forlornly
about
the
gardens
i
remember
this
but
little
more
as
the
days
went
by
my
first
grief
subsided
and
in
its
place
grew
up
a
want
which
i
have
experienced
at
every
step
in
life
from
boyhood
to
manhood
often
even
now
after
all
these
years
when
i
see
a
lad
of
twelve
or
fourteen
walking
by
his
father
side
and
glancing
merrily
up
at
his
face
i
turn
and
look
after
them
and
am
conscious
that
i
have
missed
companionship
most
sweet
and
sacred
i
shall
not
dwell
on
this
portion
of
my
story
there
were
many
tranquil
pleasant
hours
in
store
for
me
at
that
period
and
i
prefer
to
turn
to
them
one
evening
the
captain
came
smiling
into
the
with
an
open
letter
in
his
hand
my
mother
had
arrived
at
new
york
and
would
be
with
us
the
next
day
for
the
first
time
in
weeks
years
it
seemed
to
me
something
of
the
old
cheerfulness
mingled
with
our
conversation
round
the
evening
lamp
i
was
to
go
to
boston
with
the
captain
to
meet
her
and
bring
her
home
i
need
not
describe
that
meeting
with
my
mother
hand
in
mine
once
more
all
the
long
years
we
had
been
parted
appeared
like
a
dream
very
dear
to
me
was
the
sight
of
that
slender
pale
woman
passing
from
room
to
room
and
lending
a
patient
grace
and
beauty
to
the
saddened
life
of
the
old
house
everything
was
changed
with
us
now
there
were
consultations
with
lawyers
and
signing
of
papers
and
correspondence
for
my
affairs
had
been
left
in
great
confusion
and
when
these
were
settled
the
evenings
were
not
long
enough
for
us
to
hear
all
my
mother
had
to
tell
of
the
scenes
she
had
passed
through
in
the
city
then
there
were
old
times
to
talk
over
full
of
reminiscences
of
aunt
chloe
and
little
black
sam
little
black
sam
by
the
by
had
been
taken
by
his
master
from
my
father
service
ten
months
previously
and
put
on
a
near
baton
rouge
not
relishing
the
change
sam
had
run
away
and
by
some
mysterious
agency
got
into
canada
from
which
place
he
had
sent
back
several
indecorous
messages
to
his
late
owner
aunt
chloe
was
still
in
new
orleans
employed
as
nurse
in
one
of
the
cholera
hospital
wards
and
the
desmoulins
near
neighbors
of
ours
had
purchased
the
pretty
stone
house
among
the
how
all
these
simple
details
interested
me
will
be
readily
understood
by
any
boy
who
has
been
long
absent
from
home
i
was
sorry
when
it
became
necessary
to
discuss
questions
more
nearly
affecting
myself
i
had
been
removed
from
school
temporarily
but
it
was
decided
after
much
consideration
that
i
should
not
return
the
decision
being
left
in
a
manner
in
my
own
hands
the
captain
wished
to
carry
out
his
son
intention
and
send
me
to
college
for
which
i
was
nearly
fitted
but
our
means
did
not
admit
of
this
the
captain
too
could
ill
afford
to
bear
the
expense
for
his
losses
by
the
failure
of
the
new
orleans
business
had
been
heavy
yet
he
insisted
on
the
plan
not
seeing
clearly
what
other
disposal
to
make
of
me
in
the
midst
of
our
discussions
a
letter
came
from
my
uncle
snow
a
merchant
in
new
york
generously
offering
me
a
place
in
his
the
case
resolved
itself
into
this
if
i
went
to
college
i
should
have
to
be
dependent
on
captain
nutter
for
several
years
and
at
the
end
of
the
collegiate
course
would
have
no
settled
profession
if
i
accepted
my
uncle
offer
i
might
hope
to
work
my
way
to
independence
without
loss
of
time
it
was
hard
to
give
up
the
dream
of
being
a
harvard
boy
but
i
gave
it
up
the
decision
once
made
it
was
uncle
snow
wish
that
i
should
enter
his
immediately
the
cause
of
my
good
uncle
haste
was
this
he
was
afraid
that
i
would
turn
out
to
be
a
poet
before
he
could
make
a
merchant
of
me
his
fears
were
based
upon
the
fact
that
i
had
published
in
the
rivermouth
barnacle
some
verses
addressed
in
a
familiar
manner
to
the
now
the
idea
of
a
boy
with
his
living
to
get
placing
himself
in
communication
with
the
moon
struck
the
mercantile
mind
as
monstrous
it
was
not
only
a
bad
investment
it
was
lunacy
adopted
uncle
snow
views
so
far
as
to
accede
to
his
proposition
forthwith
my
mother
i
neglected
to
say
was
also
to
reside
in
new
york
i
shall
not
draw
a
picture
of
pepper
whitcomb
disgust
when
the
news
was
imparted
to
him
nor
attempt
to
paint
sailor
ben
distress
at
the
prospect
of
losing
his
little
messmate
in
the
excitement
of
preparing
for
the
journey
i
did
feel
any
very
deep
regret
myself
but
when
the
moment
came
for
leaving
and
i
saw
my
small
trunk
lashed
up
behind
the
carriage
then
the
pleasantness
of
the
old
life
and
a
vague
dread
of
the
new
came
over
me
and
a
mist
filled
my
eyes
shutting
out
the
group
of
schoolfellows
including
all
the
members
of
the
centipede
club
who
had
come
down
to
the
house
to
see
me
off
as
the
carriage
swept
round
the
corner
i
leaned
out
of
the
window
to
take
a
last
look
at
sailor
ben
cottage
and
there
was
the
flag
flying
at
so
i
left
rivermouth
little
dreaming
that
i
was
not
to
see
the
old
place
again
for
many
and
many
a
year
chapter
exeunt
omnes
with
the
close
of
my
at
rivermouth
this
modest
chronicle
ends
the
new
life
upon
which
i
entered
the
new
friends
and
foes
i
encountered
on
the
road
and
what
i
did
and
what
i
did
not
are
matters
that
do
not
come
within
the
scope
of
these
pages
but
before
i
write
finis
to
the
record
as
it
stands
before
i
leave
it
feeling
as
if
i
were
once
more
going
away
from
my
boyhood
i
have
a
word
or
two
to
say
concerning
a
few
of
the
personages
who
have
figured
in
the
story
if
you
will
allow
me
to
call
gypsy
a
personage
i
am
sure
that
the
reader
who
has
followed
me
thus
far
will
be
willing
to
hear
what
became
of
her
and
sailor
ben
and
miss
abigail
and
the
captain
first
about
gypsy
a
month
after
my
departure
from
rivermouth
the
captain
informed
me
by
letter
that
he
had
parted
with
the
little
mare
according
to
agreement
she
had
been
sold
to
the
of
a
travelling
circus
i
had
stipulated
on
this
disposal
of
her
and
was
about
to
set
out
on
her
travels
she
did
not
disappoint
my
glowing
anticipations
but
became
quite
a
celebrity
in
her
way
by
dancing
the
polka
to
slow
music
on
a
constructed
for
the
purpose
i
chanced
once
a
long
while
afterwards
to
be
in
a
country
town
where
her
troupe
was
giving
exhibitions
i
even
read
the
gaudily
illumined
setting
forth
the
accomplishments
of
zuleika
the
famed
arabian
trick
pony
but
i
failed
to
recognize
my
dear
little
mustang
girl
behind
those
titles
and
so
alas
did
not
attend
the
performance
i
hope
all
the
praises
she
received
and
all
the
spangled
trappings
she
wore
did
not
spoil
her
but
i
am
afraid
they
did
for
she
was
always
over
much
given
to
the
vanities
of
this
world
miss
abigail
regulated
the
domestic
destinies
of
my
household
until
the
day
of
her
death
which
theophilus
tredick
solemnly
averred
was
hastened
by
the
inveterate
habit
she
had
contracted
of
swallowing
unknown
quantities
of
whenever
she
fancied
herself
out
of
sorts
empty
phials
were
found
in
a
on
a
shelf
in
her
bedroom
closet
the
old
house
became
very
lonely
when
the
family
got
reduced
to
captain
nutter
and
kitty
and
when
kitty
passed
away
my
grandfather
divided
his
time
between
rivermouth
and
new
york
sailor
ben
did
not
long
survive
his
little
irish
lass
as
he
always
fondly
called
her
at
his
demise
which
took
place
about
six
years
since
he
left
his
property
in
trust
to
the
managers
of
a
home
for
aged
in
his
will
which
was
a
very
whimsical
document
written
by
himself
and
worded
with
much
shrewdness
too
he
warned
the
trustees
that
when
he
got
aloft
he
intended
to
keep
his
weather
eye
on
them
and
should
send
a
speritual
shot
across
their
bows
and
bring
them
to
if
they
did
treat
the
aged
mariners
handsomely
he
also
expressed
a
wish
to
have
his
body
stitched
up
in
a
shotted
hammock
and
dropped
into
the
harbor
but
as
he
did
not
strenuously
insist
on
this
and
as
it
was
not
in
accordance
with
my
preconceived
notions
of
christian
burial
the
admiral
was
laid
to
rest
beside
kitty
in
the
old
south
burying
ground
with
an
anchor
that
would
have
delighted
him
neatly
carved
on
his
headstone
i
am
sorry
the
fire
has
gone
out
in
the
old
ship
stove
in
that
cottage
at
the
head
of
the
wharf
i
am
sorry
they
have
taken
down
the
and
painted
over
the
funny
for
i
loved
the
old
cabin
as
it
was
they
might
have
let
it
alone
for
several
months
after
leaving
rivermouth
i
carried
on
a
voluminous
correspondence
with
pepper
whitcomb
but
it
gradually
dwindled
down
to
a
single
letter
a
month
and
then
to
none
at
all
but
while
he
remained
at
the
temple
grammar
school
he
kept
me
advised
of
the
current
gossip
of
the
town
and
the
doings
of
the
centipedes
as
one
by
one
the
boys
left
the
academy
adams
harris
marden
blake
and
langdon
to
seek
their
fortunes
elsewhere
there
was
less
to
interest
me
in
the
old
seaport
and
when
pepper
himself
went
to
philadelphia
to
read
law
i
had
no
one
to
give
me
an
inkling
of
what
was
going
on
there
was
much
to
go
on
to
be
sure
great
events
no
longer
considered
it
worth
their
while
to
honor
so
quiet
a
place
one
fourth
of
july
the
temple
grammar
school
burnt
down
set
on
fire
it
was
supposed
by
an
eccentric
squib
that
was
seen
to
bolt
into
an
upper
window
and
grimshaw
retired
from
public
life
married
and
lived
happily
ever
after
as
the
say
the
widow
conway
i
am
able
to
state
did
not
succeed
in
enslaving
meeks
the
apothecary
who
united
himself
clandestinely
to
one
of
miss
dorothy
gibbs
young
ladies
and
lost
the
patronage
of
primrose
hall
in
consequence
young
conway
went
into
the
grocery
business
with
his
ancient
chum
rodgers
rodgers
conway
i
read
the
sign
only
last
summer
when
i
was
down
in
rivermouth
and
had
half
a
mind
to
pop
into
the
shop
and
shake
hands
with
him
and
ask
him
if
he
wanted
to
fight
i
contented
myself
however
with
flattening
my
nose
against
his
dingy
and
beheld
conway
in
red
whiskers
and
blue
overalls
weighing
out
sugar
for
a
customer
giving
him
short
weight
i
bet
anything
i
have
reserved
my
pleasantest
word
for
the
last
it
is
touching
the
captain
the
captain
is
still
hale
and
rosy
and
if
he
does
relate
his
exploit
in
the
war
of
as
spiritedly
as
he
used
to
he
makes
up
by
relating
it
more
frequently
and
telling
it
differently
every
time
he
passes
his
winters
in
new
york
and
his
summers
in
the
nutter
house
which
threatens
to
prove
a
hard
nut
for
the
destructive
gentleman
with
the
scythe
and
the
for
the
seaward
gable
has
not
yielded
a
clapboard
to
the
eastwind
these
twenty
years
the
captain
has
now
become
the
oldest
inhabitant
in
rivermouth
and
so
i
do
laugh
at
the
oldest
inhabitant
any
more
but
pray
in
my
heart
that
he
may
occupy
the
post
of
honor
for
half
a
century
to
come
so
ends
the
story
of
a
bad
boy
but
not
such
a
very
bad
boy
as
i
told
you
to
begin
with
