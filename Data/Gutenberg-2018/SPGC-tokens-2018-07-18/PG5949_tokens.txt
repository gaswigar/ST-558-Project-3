riley
i
the
street
was
as
still
as
a
country
sunday
so
quiet
that
there
seemed
an
echo
to
my
footsteps
it
was
four
in
the
morning
clear
october
moonlight
misted
through
the
thinning
foliage
to
the
shadowy
sidewalk
and
lay
like
a
transparent
silver
fog
upon
the
house
of
my
admiration
as
i
strode
along
returning
from
my
first
night
work
on
the
wainwright
morning
i
had
already
marked
that
house
as
the
finest
to
my
taste
in
wainwright
though
hitherto
on
my
excursions
to
this
metropolis
the
state
capital
i
was
not
without
a
certain
native
jealousy
that
spencerville
the
where
i
lived
had
nothing
so
good
now
however
i
approached
its
purlieus
with
a
pleasure
in
it
quite
unalloyed
for
i
was
at
last
myself
a
resident
albeit
of
only
one
standing
of
wainwright
and
the
house
though
i
had
not
even
an
idea
who
lived
there
part
of
my
possessions
as
a
citizen
moreover
i
might
enjoy
the
warmer
pride
of
a
for
apperthwaite
where
i
had
taken
a
room
was
just
beyond
this
was
the
quietest
part
of
wainwright
business
stopped
short
of
it
and
the
fashionable
residence
section
had
overleaped
this
forgotten
backwater
leaving
it
undisturbed
and
unchanging
with
that
look
about
it
which
is
the
quality
of
few
urban
quarters
and
eventually
of
none
as
a
town
grows
to
be
a
city
the
look
of
still
being
a
neighborhood
this
friendliness
of
appearance
was
largely
the
emanation
of
the
homely
and
beautiful
house
which
so
greatly
pleased
my
fancy
it
might
be
difficult
to
say
why
i
thought
it
the
finest
house
in
wainwright
for
a
simpler
structure
would
be
hard
to
imagine
it
was
merely
a
big
brick
house
painted
brown
and
very
plain
set
well
away
from
the
street
among
some
splendid
forest
trees
with
a
fair
spread
of
flat
lawn
but
it
gave
back
a
great
deal
for
your
glance
just
as
some
people
do
it
was
a
large
house
as
i
say
yet
it
looked
not
like
a
mansion
but
like
a
home
and
made
you
wish
that
you
lived
in
it
or
driving
by
of
an
evening
you
would
have
liked
to
hitch
your
horse
and
go
in
it
spoke
so
surely
of
hearty
people
living
there
who
would
welcome
you
merrily
it
looked
like
a
house
where
there
were
a
grandfather
and
a
grandmother
where
holidays
were
warmly
kept
where
there
were
boisterous
family
reunions
to
which
uncles
and
aunts
who
had
been
born
there
would
return
from
no
matter
what
distances
a
house
where
big
turkeys
would
be
on
the
table
often
where
one
called
the
hired
man
and
named
either
abner
or
ole
would
crack
walnuts
upon
a
clutched
between
his
knees
on
the
back
porch
it
looked
like
a
house
where
they
played
charades
where
there
would
be
long
streamers
of
evergreen
and
dozens
of
wreaths
of
holly
at
where
there
were
tearful
happy
weddings
and
great
throwings
of
rice
after
little
brides
from
the
broad
front
steps
in
a
word
it
was
the
sort
of
a
house
to
make
the
hearts
of
spinsters
and
bachelors
very
lonely
and
wistful
and
that
is
about
as
near
as
i
can
come
to
my
reason
for
thinking
it
the
finest
house
in
wainwright
the
moon
hung
kindly
above
its
level
roof
in
the
silence
of
that
october
morning
as
i
checked
my
gait
to
loiter
along
the
picket
fence
but
suddenly
the
house
showed
a
light
of
its
own
the
spurt
of
a
match
took
my
eye
to
one
of
the
upper
windows
then
a
steadier
glow
of
orange
told
me
that
a
lamp
was
lighted
the
window
was
opened
and
a
man
looked
out
and
whistled
loudly
i
stopped
thinking
that
he
meant
to
attract
my
attention
that
something
might
be
wrong
that
perhaps
some
one
was
needed
to
go
for
a
doctor
my
mistake
was
immediately
evident
however
i
stood
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
bordering
the
sidewalk
and
the
man
at
the
window
had
not
seen
me
boy
boy
he
called
softly
where
are
you
simpledoria
he
leaned
from
the
window
looking
downward
why
there
you
are
he
exclaimed
and
turned
to
address
some
invisible
person
within
the
room
he
right
there
underneath
the
window
i
bring
him
he
leaned
out
again
wait
there
simpledoria
he
called
i
be
down
in
a
jiffy
and
let
you
puzzled
i
stared
at
the
vacant
lawn
before
me
the
clear
moonlight
revealed
it
brightly
and
it
was
empty
of
any
living
presence
there
were
no
bushes
nor
shrubberies
nor
even
shadows
that
could
have
been
mistaken
for
a
boy
if
simpledoria
was
a
boy
there
was
no
dog
in
sight
there
was
no
cat
there
was
nothing
beneath
the
window
except
thick
grass
a
light
shone
in
the
hallway
behind
the
broad
front
doors
one
of
these
was
opened
and
revealed
in
silhouette
the
tall
thin
figure
of
a
man
in
a
long
simpledoria
he
said
addressing
the
night
air
with
considerable
severity
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
you
you
might
have
caught
your
death
of
cold
roving
out
at
such
an
hour
but
there
he
continued
more
indulgently
wipe
your
feet
on
the
mat
and
come
in
you
safe
now
he
closed
the
door
and
i
heard
him
call
to
some
one
as
he
rearranged
the
fastenings
simpledoria
is
all
right
only
a
little
chilled
i
bring
him
up
to
your
i
went
on
my
way
in
a
condition
of
astonishment
that
engendered
almost
a
doubt
of
my
eyes
for
if
my
sight
was
unimpaired
and
myself
not
subject
to
optical
or
mental
delusion
neither
boy
nor
dog
nor
bird
nor
cat
nor
any
other
object
of
this
visible
world
had
entered
that
opened
door
was
my
finest
house
then
a
place
of
call
for
wandering
ghosts
who
came
home
to
roost
at
four
in
the
morning
it
was
only
a
step
to
apperthwaite
i
let
myself
in
with
the
key
that
good
lady
had
given
me
stole
up
to
my
room
went
to
my
window
and
stared
across
the
yard
at
the
house
next
door
the
front
window
in
the
second
story
i
decided
necessarily
belonged
to
that
room
in
which
the
lamp
had
been
lighted
but
all
was
dark
there
now
i
went
to
bed
and
dreamed
that
i
was
out
at
sea
in
a
fog
having
embarked
on
a
transparent
vessel
whose
preposterous
name
inscribed
upon
glass
depending
here
and
there
from
an
invisible
rail
was
simpledoria
ii
apperthwaite
was
a
commodious
old
house
the
greater
part
of
it
of
about
the
same
age
i
judged
as
its
neighbor
but
the
late
apperthwaite
had
caught
the
mansard
fever
of
the
late
and
the
once
fastened
upon
him
had
never
known
a
convalescence
but
rather
a
series
of
relapses
the
tokens
of
which
in
the
nature
of
a
cupola
and
a
couple
of
frame
turrets
were
terrifyingly
apparent
these
romantic
misplacements
seemed
to
me
not
inharmonious
with
the
library
a
cheerful
and
pleasantly
shabby
apartment
where
i
found
over
a
substratum
of
history
encyclopaedia
and
family
bible
some
worn
old
volumes
of
godey
book
an
early
edition
of
cooper
works
scott
bulwer
macaulay
byron
and
tennyson
complete
some
odd
volumes
of
victor
hugo
of
the
elder
dumas
of
flaubert
of
gautier
and
of
balzac
clarissa
lalla
rookh
the
alhambra
beulah
uarda
lucile
uncle
tom
cabin
trilby
she
little
lord
fauntleroy
and
of
a
later
decade
there
were
novels
about
those
delicately
tangled
emotions
experienced
by
the
supreme
few
and
stories
of
adventurous
royalty
tales
of
young
american
manhood
and
some
thin
volumes
of
rather
precious
verse
was
amid
these
romantic
scenes
that
i
awaited
the
sound
of
the
which
for
me
was
the
announcement
of
breakfast
when
i
arose
from
my
first
night
slumbers
under
apperthwaite
roof
and
i
wondered
if
the
books
were
a
fair
mirror
of
miss
apperthwaite
mind
i
had
been
told
that
apperthwaite
had
a
daughter
apperthwaite
herself
in
her
youth
might
have
sat
to
an
illustrator
of
scott
or
bulwer
even
now
you
could
see
she
had
come
as
near
being
romantically
beautiful
as
was
consistently
proper
for
such
a
timid
gentle
little
gentlewoman
as
she
was
reduced
by
her
insolvency
coincident
with
his
demise
to
keeping
boarders
she
did
it
gracefully
as
if
the
urgency
thereto
were
only
a
spirit
of
quiet
hospitality
it
should
be
added
in
haste
that
she
set
an
excellent
table
moreover
the
guests
who
gathered
at
her
board
were
of
a
very
attractive
description
as
i
decided
the
instant
my
eye
fell
upon
the
lady
who
sat
opposite
me
at
lunch
i
knew
at
once
that
she
was
miss
apperthwaite
she
went
so
as
they
say
with
her
mother
nothing
could
have
been
more
suitable
apperthwaite
was
the
kind
of
woman
whom
you
would
expect
to
have
a
beautiful
daughter
and
miss
apperthwaite
more
than
fulfilled
her
mother
promise
i
guessed
her
to
be
more
than
juliet
capulet
age
indeed
yet
still
between
that
and
the
perfect
age
of
woman
she
was
of
a
larger
fuller
more
striking
type
than
apperthwaite
a
bolder
type
one
might
put
it
though
she
might
have
been
a
great
deal
bolder
than
apperthwaite
without
being
bold
certainly
she
was
handsome
enough
to
make
it
difficult
for
a
young
fellow
to
keep
from
staring
at
her
she
had
an
abundance
of
very
soft
dark
hair
worn
almost
severely
as
if
its
profusion
necessitated
repression
and
i
am
compelled
to
admit
that
her
fine
eyes
expressed
a
distant
contemplation
obviously
of
habit
not
of
mood
so
pronounced
that
one
of
her
enemies
if
she
had
any
might
have
described
them
as
only
one
other
of
my
own
sex
was
present
at
the
a
dowden
an
elderly
lawyer
and
politician
of
whom
i
had
heard
and
to
whom
apperthwaite
coming
in
after
the
rest
of
us
were
seated
introduced
me
she
made
the
presentation
general
and
i
had
the
experience
of
receiving
a
nod
and
a
slow
glance
in
which
there
was
a
sort
of
dusky
estimating
brilliance
from
the
beautiful
lady
opposite
me
it
might
have
been
better
mannered
for
me
to
address
myself
to
dowden
or
one
of
the
very
nice
elderly
women
who
were
my
than
to
open
a
conversation
with
miss
apperthwaite
but
i
did
not
stop
to
think
of
that
you
have
a
splendid
old
house
next
door
to
you
here
miss
apperthwaite
i
said
it
a
privilege
to
find
it
in
view
from
my
there
was
a
faint
stir
as
of
some
consternation
in
the
little
company
the
elderly
ladies
stopped
talking
abruptly
and
exchanged
glances
though
this
was
not
of
my
observation
at
the
moment
i
think
but
recurred
to
my
consciousness
later
when
i
had
perceived
my
blunder
may
i
ask
who
lives
there
i
pursued
miss
apperthwaite
allowed
her
noticeable
lashes
to
cover
her
eyes
for
an
instant
then
looked
up
again
a
beasley
she
said
not
the
honorable
david
beasley
i
exclaimed
yes
she
returned
with
a
certain
gravity
which
i
afterward
wished
had
checked
me
do
you
know
him
not
in
person
i
explained
you
see
i
written
a
good
deal
about
him
i
was
with
the
spencerville
journal
until
a
few
days
ago
and
even
in
the
country
we
know
who
who
in
politics
over
the
state
beasley
the
man
that
went
to
congress
and
never
made
a
speech
never
made
even
a
motion
to
adjourn
but
got
everything
his
district
wanted
there
talk
of
him
now
for
indeed
and
so
it
the
honorable
david
beasley
who
lives
in
that
splendid
place
how
curious
that
is
why
asked
miss
apperthwaite
it
seems
too
big
for
one
man
i
answered
and
i
always
had
the
impression
beasley
was
a
yes
she
said
rather
slowly
he
but
of
course
he
does
live
there
all
alone
i
supposed
aloud
probably
he
has
no
there
no
one
else
except
a
couple
of
colored
what
a
crime
i
exclaimed
if
there
ever
was
a
house
meant
for
a
large
family
that
one
is
ca
you
almost
hear
it
crying
out
for
heaps
and
heaps
of
romping
children
i
should
think
i
was
interrupted
by
a
loud
cough
from
dowden
so
abrupt
and
artificial
that
his
intention
to
check
the
flow
of
my
innocent
prattle
was
embarrassingly
obvious
even
to
me
can
you
tell
me
he
said
leaning
forward
and
following
up
the
interruption
as
hastily
as
possible
what
the
farmers
were
getting
for
their
wheat
when
you
left
spencerville
cents
i
answered
and
felt
my
ears
growing
red
with
mortification
too
late
i
remembered
that
the
in
a
community
should
guard
his
tongue
among
the
natives
until
he
has
unravelled
the
skein
of
their
relationships
alliances
feuds
and
private
wars
a
precept
not
unlike
the
classic
injunction
yes
my
darling
daughter
hang
your
clothes
on
a
hickory
limb
but
do
go
near
the
however
in
my
confusion
i
warmly
regretted
my
failure
to
follow
it
and
resolved
not
to
blunder
again
dowden
thanked
me
for
the
information
for
which
he
had
no
real
desire
and
the
elderly
ladies
again
taking
up
with
all
too
evident
relief
their
various
mild
debates
he
inquired
if
i
played
bridge
but
i
forget
he
added
of
course
you
be
at
the
office
in
the
evenings
and
ca
be
after
which
he
immediately
began
to
question
me
about
my
work
making
his
determination
to
give
me
no
opportunity
again
to
mention
the
honorable
david
beasley
unnecessarily
conspicuous
as
i
thought
i
could
only
conclude
that
some
unpleasantness
had
arisen
between
himself
and
beasley
probably
of
political
origin
since
they
were
both
in
politics
and
of
personal
and
consequently
bitter
development
and
that
dowden
found
the
mention
of
beasley
not
only
unpleasant
to
himself
but
a
possible
embarrassment
to
the
ladies
who
i
supposed
were
aware
of
the
quarrel
on
his
account
after
lunch
not
having
to
report
at
the
office
immediately
i
took
unto
myself
the
solace
of
a
cigar
which
kept
me
company
during
a
stroll
about
apperthwaite
capacious
yard
in
the
rear
i
found
an
the
bushes
long
since
bloomless
and
now
brown
with
autumn
and
i
paced
its
gravelled
paths
up
and
down
at
the
same
time
favoring
beasley
house
with
a
covert
study
that
would
have
done
credit
to
a
for
the
sting
of
my
blunder
at
the
table
was
quiescent
or
at
least
neutralized
under
the
itch
of
a
curiosity
far
from
satisfied
concerning
the
interesting
premises
next
door
the
gentleman
in
the
i
was
sure
could
have
been
no
other
than
the
honorable
david
beasley
himself
he
came
not
in
eyeshot
now
neither
he
nor
any
other
there
was
no
sign
of
life
about
the
place
that
portion
of
his
yard
which
lay
behind
the
house
was
not
within
my
vision
it
is
true
his
property
being
here
separated
from
apperthwaite
by
a
board
fence
higher
than
a
tall
man
could
reach
but
there
was
no
sound
from
the
other
side
of
this
partition
save
that
caused
by
the
quiet
movement
of
rusty
leaves
in
the
breeze
my
cigar
was
at
when
the
green
lattice
door
of
apperthwaite
back
porch
was
opened
and
miss
apperthwaite
bearing
a
saucer
of
milk
issued
therefrom
followed
hastily
by
a
very
white
fat
cat
with
a
pink
ribbon
round
its
neck
a
vibrant
nose
and
fixed
voracious
eyes
uplifted
to
the
saucer
the
lady
and
her
cat
offered
to
view
a
group
as
pretty
as
a
popular
painting
it
was
even
improved
when
stooping
miss
apperthwaite
set
the
saucer
upon
the
ground
and
continuing
in
that
posture
stroked
the
cat
to
bend
so
far
is
a
test
of
a
woman
grace
i
have
observed
she
turned
her
face
toward
me
and
smiled
i
almost
at
the
age
you
what
age
i
asked
stupidly
enough
when
we
take
to
cats
she
said
rising
spinsterhood
we
like
to
call
it
that
is
your
kind
heart
you
decline
to
make
one
of
us
happy
to
the
despair
of
all
the
she
laughed
at
this
though
with
no
very
genuine
mirth
i
marked
and
let
my
attempt
at
gallantry
pass
without
other
retort
you
seemed
interested
in
the
old
place
she
indicated
beasley
house
with
a
nod
oh
i
understood
my
blunder
i
said
quickly
i
wish
i
had
known
the
subject
was
embarrassing
or
unpleasant
to
what
made
you
think
that
surely
i
said
you
saw
how
pointedly
he
cut
me
yes
she
returned
thoughtfully
he
rather
did
it
true
at
least
i
see
how
you
got
that
she
seemed
to
muse
upon
this
letting
her
eyes
fall
then
raising
them
allowed
her
gaze
to
rest
upon
the
house
beyond
the
fence
and
said
it
is
an
interesting
old
and
beasley
himself
i
began
oh
she
said
he
is
interesting
that
his
trouble
you
mean
his
trouble
not
to
she
interrupted
me
speaking
with
sudden
surprising
energy
i
mean
he
a
man
of
no
no
imagination
i
exclaimed
none
in
the
world
not
one
ounce
of
imagination
not
one
grain
then
who
i
cried
or
what
is
simpledoria
simple
what
she
said
plainly
mystified
simpledoria
she
repeated
and
laughed
what
in
the
world
is
that
you
never
heard
of
it
before
never
in
my
you
lived
next
door
to
beasley
a
long
time
have
you
all
my
and
i
suppose
you
must
know
him
pretty
what
next
she
said
smiling
you
said
he
lived
there
all
alone
i
went
on
tentatively
except
for
an
old
colored
couple
his
can
you
tell
me
i
hesitated
has
he
ever
been
thought
well
never
she
answered
emphatically
never
anything
so
exciting
merely
deadly
and
hopelessly
she
picked
up
the
saucer
now
exceedingly
empty
and
set
it
upon
a
shelf
by
the
lattice
door
what
was
it
about
what
was
that
name
i
will
tell
you
i
said
and
i
related
in
detail
the
singular
performance
of
which
i
had
been
a
witness
in
the
late
moonlight
before
that
morning
dawn
as
i
talked
we
half
unconsciously
moved
across
the
lawn
together
finally
seating
ourselves
upon
a
bench
beyond
the
and
near
the
high
fence
the
interest
my
companion
exhibited
in
the
narration
might
have
surprised
me
had
my
nocturnal
experience
itself
been
less
surprising
she
interrupted
me
now
and
then
with
little
ejaculations
of
acute
wonder
but
sat
for
the
most
part
with
her
elbow
on
her
knee
and
her
chin
in
her
hand
her
face
turned
eagerly
to
mine
and
her
lips
parted
in
attention
there
was
nothing
far
away
about
her
eyes
now
they
were
widely
and
intently
alert
when
i
finished
she
shook
her
head
slowly
as
if
quite
dumfounded
and
altered
her
position
leaning
against
the
back
of
the
bench
and
gazing
straight
before
her
without
speaking
it
was
plain
that
her
extraordinary
behavior
had
revealed
a
phase
of
his
character
novel
enough
to
be
startling
one
explanation
might
be
just
barely
possible
i
said
if
it
is
it
is
the
most
remarkable
case
of
somnambulism
on
record
did
you
ever
hear
of
beasley
walking
in
his
she
touched
me
lightly
but
peremptorily
on
the
arm
in
warning
and
i
stopped
on
the
other
side
of
the
board
fence
a
door
opened
creakily
and
there
sounded
a
loud
and
cheerful
voice
that
of
the
gentleman
in
the
here
we
come
it
said
me
and
big
bill
hammersley
i
want
to
show
bill
i
can
jump
anyways
three
times
as
far
as
he
can
come
on
is
that
beasley
voice
i
asked
under
my
breath
miss
apperthwaite
nodded
in
affirmation
could
he
have
heard
me
no
she
whispered
he
just
come
out
of
the
and
then
to
herself
who
under
heaven
is
bill
hammersley
i
never
heard
of
him
of
course
bill
said
the
voice
beyond
the
fence
if
you
afraid
i
beat
you
too
badly
you
still
got
time
to
back
out
i
did
understand
you
to
kind
of
hint
that
you
were
considerable
of
a
jumper
but
if
what
what
you
say
bill
there
ensued
a
moment
complete
silence
oh
all
right
the
voice
then
continued
you
say
you
in
this
to
win
do
you
well
so
i
bill
hammersley
so
i
who
go
first
me
all
right
from
the
edge
of
the
walk
here
now
then
one
two
three
ha
a
sound
came
to
our
ears
of
some
one
landing
heavily
and
at
full
length
it
seemed
on
the
turf
followed
by
a
slight
rusty
groan
in
the
same
voice
ugh
do
you
laugh
bill
hammersley
i
have
jumped
as
much
as
i
ought
to
these
last
twenty
years
i
reckon
i
kind
of
lost
the
hang
of
it
aha
there
were
indications
that
beasley
was
picking
himself
up
and
brushing
his
trousers
with
his
hands
now
your
turn
bill
what
say
silence
again
followed
by
yes
i
make
simpledoria
get
out
of
the
way
come
here
simpledoria
now
bill
put
your
heels
together
on
the
edge
of
the
walk
that
right
all
ready
now
then
one
for
the
money
two
for
the
show
three
to
make
ready
and
four
for
to
go
another
silence
by
jingo
bill
hammersley
beat
me
ha
ha
that
was
a
jump
what
say
silence
once
more
you
say
you
can
do
even
better
than
that
now
bill
do
brag
oh
you
say
you
often
jumped
farther
oh
you
say
that
was
up
in
scotland
where
you
had
a
oho
all
right
let
see
how
far
you
can
jump
when
you
really
try
there
heels
on
the
walk
again
that
right
swing
your
arms
one
two
three
there
you
go
another
silence
zing
well
sir
i
be
snitched
to
flinders
if
you
did
do
it
that
time
bill
hammersley
i
see
i
never
really
saw
any
jumping
before
in
all
my
born
days
it
eleven
feet
if
it
an
inch
what
you
say
you
i
heard
no
more
for
miss
apperthwaite
her
face
flushed
and
her
eyes
shining
beckoned
me
imperiously
to
follow
her
and
departed
so
hurriedly
that
it
might
be
said
she
ran
i
do
know
said
i
keeping
at
her
elbow
whether
it
more
like
alice
or
the
interlocutor
conversation
at
a
minstrel
hush
she
warned
me
though
we
were
already
at
a
safe
distance
and
did
not
speak
again
until
we
had
reached
the
front
walk
there
she
paused
and
i
noted
that
she
was
trembling
and
no
doubt
correctly
judged
her
emotion
to
be
that
of
consternation
there
was
no
one
there
she
exclaimed
he
was
all
by
himself
it
was
just
the
same
as
what
you
saw
last
night
did
it
sound
to
you
there
was
a
little
awed
tremor
in
her
voice
that
i
found
very
appealing
did
it
sound
to
you
like
a
person
who
lost
his
mind
i
do
know
i
said
i
do
know
at
all
what
to
make
of
he
could
have
been
her
eyes
grew
very
wide
intoxicated
no
i
sure
it
was
then
do
know
what
to
make
of
it
either
all
that
wild
talk
about
hammersley
and
and
in
scotland
and
and
an
jump
i
suggested
why
there
no
more
a
hammersley
she
cried
with
a
gesture
of
excited
emphasis
than
there
is
a
so
it
appears
i
agreed
he
lived
there
all
alone
she
said
solemnly
in
that
big
house
so
long
just
sitting
there
evening
after
evening
all
by
himself
never
going
out
never
reading
anything
not
even
thinking
but
just
sitting
and
sitting
and
sitting
and
sitting
well
she
broke
off
suddenly
shook
the
frown
from
her
forehead
and
made
me
the
offer
of
a
dazzling
smile
there
no
use
bothering
one
own
head
about
i
glad
to
have
a
i
said
it
so
eerie
i
might
have
concluded
there
was
something
the
matter
with
you
going
to
your
work
she
asked
as
i
turned
toward
the
gate
i
very
glad
i
do
have
to
go
to
yours
i
inquired
rather
blankly
i
teach
algebra
and
plain
geometry
at
the
high
school
said
this
surprising
young
woman
thank
heaven
it
saturday
i
reading
les
miserables
for
the
seventh
time
and
i
going
to
have
a
real
orgy
over
gervaise
and
the
barricade
this
afternoon
iii
i
do
not
know
why
it
should
have
astonished
me
to
find
that
miss
apperthwaite
was
a
teacher
of
mathematics
except
that
to
my
inexperienced
eye
she
did
look
it
she
looked
more
like
charlotte
corday
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
opposite
me
at
lunch
the
next
day
when
dowden
kept
me
occupied
with
spencerville
politics
obviously
from
fear
that
i
would
break
out
again
but
no
stroll
in
the
yard
with
her
rewarded
me
afterward
as
i
dimly
hoped
for
she
disappeared
before
i
left
the
table
and
i
did
not
see
her
again
for
a
fortnight
on
she
did
not
return
to
the
house
for
lunch
my
only
meal
at
apperthwaite
i
dined
at
a
restaurant
near
the
despatch
office
and
she
was
out
of
town
for
a
little
visit
her
mother
informed
us
over
the
following
saturday
and
sunday
she
was
not
altogether
out
of
my
thoughts
however
indeed
she
almost
divided
them
with
the
honorable
david
beasley
a
better
view
which
i
was
afforded
of
this
gentleman
did
not
lessen
my
interest
in
him
increased
it
rather
it
also
served
to
make
the
extraordinary
didoes
of
which
he
had
been
the
virtuoso
and
i
the
audience
more
than
ever
profoundly
inexplicable
my
glimpse
of
him
in
the
lighted
doorway
had
given
me
the
vaguest
impression
of
his
appearance
but
one
afternoon
a
few
days
after
my
interview
with
miss
apperthwaite
i
was
starting
for
the
office
and
met
him
as
he
was
turning
in
at
his
gate
i
took
as
careful
invoice
of
him
as
i
could
without
conspicuously
glaring
there
was
something
remarkably
taking
as
we
say
about
this
man
something
easy
and
genial
and
quizzical
and
careless
he
was
the
kind
of
person
you
like
to
meet
on
the
street
whose
cheerful
passing
sends
you
on
feeling
indefinably
a
little
gayer
than
you
did
he
was
tall
thin
even
gaunt
perhaps
and
his
face
was
long
rather
pale
and
shrewd
and
gentle
something
in
its
oddity
not
unremindful
of
the
late
sol
smith
russell
his
hat
was
tilted
back
a
little
the
slightest
bit
to
one
side
and
the
sparse
brownish
hair
above
his
high
forehead
was
going
to
be
gray
before
long
he
looked
about
forty
the
truth
is
i
had
expected
to
see
a
cousin
german
to
don
quixote
i
had
thought
to
detect
signs
and
gleams
of
wildness
however
slight
something
a
little
one
glance
of
that
kindly
and
humorous
eye
told
me
such
expectation
had
been
nonsense
odd
he
might
have
been
gadzooks
he
looked
it
but
queer
never
the
fact
that
miss
apperthwaite
could
picture
such
a
man
as
this
sitting
and
sitting
and
sitting
himself
into
any
form
of
mania
or
madness
whatever
spoke
loudly
of
her
own
imagination
indeed
the
key
to
simpledoria
was
to
be
sought
under
some
other
mat
as
i
began
to
know
some
of
my
on
the
despatch
and
to
pick
up
acquaintances
here
and
there
about
town
i
sometimes
made
beasley
the
subject
of
inquiry
everybody
knew
him
oh
yes
i
know
dave
beasley
would
come
the
reply
nearly
always
with
a
chuckling
sort
of
laugh
i
gathered
that
he
had
a
name
for
which
amounted
to
eccentricity
it
was
said
that
what
the
and
got
out
of
him
in
campaign
times
made
the
political
managers
cry
he
was
the
first
and
readiest
prey
for
every
fraud
and
swindler
that
came
to
wainwright
i
heard
and
yet
in
spite
of
this
and
of
his
hatred
of
he
as
silent
as
grant
said
one
informant
he
had
a
large
practice
and
was
one
of
the
most
successful
lawyers
in
the
state
one
story
they
told
of
him
or
as
they
were
more
apt
to
put
it
on
him
was
repeated
so
often
that
i
saw
it
had
become
one
of
the
traditions
one
bitter
evening
in
february
they
related
he
was
approached
upon
the
street
by
a
ragged
whining
and
shivering
old
reprobate
notorious
for
the
various
ingenuities
by
which
he
had
worn
out
the
patience
of
the
charity
organizations
he
asked
beasley
for
a
dime
beasley
had
no
money
in
his
pockets
but
gave
the
man
his
overcoat
went
home
without
any
himself
and
spent
six
weeks
in
bed
with
a
bad
case
of
pneumonia
as
the
direct
result
his
beneficiary
sold
the
overcoat
and
invested
the
proceeds
in
a
spree
in
the
closing
scenes
of
which
a
couple
of
brickbats
were
featured
to
high
spectacular
effect
one
he
sent
through
a
jeweller
in
an
attempt
to
intimidate
some
wholly
imaginary
pursuers
the
other
he
projected
at
a
perfectly
actual
policeman
who
was
endeavoring
to
soothe
him
the
victim
of
beasley
charity
and
the
officer
were
then
borne
to
the
hospital
in
company
it
was
due
in
part
to
recollections
of
this
legend
and
others
of
a
similar
character
that
people
laughed
when
they
said
oh
yes
i
know
dave
beasley
altogether
i
should
say
beasley
was
about
the
most
popular
man
in
wainwright
i
could
discover
nowhere
anything
however
to
shed
the
faintest
light
upon
the
mystery
of
bill
hammersley
and
simpledoria
it
was
not
until
the
sunday
of
miss
apperthwaite
absence
that
the
revelation
came
that
afternoon
i
went
to
call
upon
the
widow
of
a
of
mine
she
lived
in
a
cottage
not
far
from
apperthwaite
upon
the
same
street
i
found
her
sitting
on
a
pleasant
veranda
with
boxes
of
flowering
plants
along
the
railing
though
indian
summer
was
now
close
upon
departure
she
was
rocking
meditatively
and
held
a
finger
in
a
morocco
volume
apparently
of
verse
though
i
suspected
she
had
been
better
entertained
in
the
observation
of
the
people
and
vehicles
decorously
passing
along
the
sunlit
thoroughfare
within
her
view
we
exchanged
inevitable
questions
and
news
of
mutual
relatives
i
had
told
her
how
i
liked
my
work
and
what
i
thought
of
wainwright
and
she
was
congratulating
me
upon
having
found
so
pleasant
a
place
to
live
as
apperthwaite
when
she
interrupted
herself
to
smile
and
nod
a
cordial
greeting
to
two
gentlemen
driving
by
in
a
phaeton
they
waved
their
hats
to
her
gayly
then
leaned
back
comfortably
against
the
cushions
and
if
ever
two
men
were
obviously
and
incontestably
on
the
best
of
terms
with
each
other
these
two
were
they
were
david
beasley
and
dowden
i
do
wish
said
my
cousin
resuming
her
rocking
i
do
wish
dear
david
beasley
would
get
a
new
trap
of
some
kind
that
old
phaeton
of
his
is
a
disgrace
i
suppose
you
have
met
him
of
course
living
at
apperthwaite
you
would
be
apt
but
what
is
he
doing
with
dowden
i
asked
she
lifted
her
eyebrows
why
taking
him
for
a
drive
i
no
i
mean
how
do
they
happen
to
be
together
why
should
they
be
they
old
friends
they
are
and
in
answer
to
her
look
of
surprise
i
explained
that
i
had
begun
to
speak
of
beasley
at
apperthwaite
and
described
the
abruptness
with
which
dowden
had
changed
the
subject
i
see
my
cousin
nodded
comprehendingly
that
simple
enough
george
dowden
did
want
you
to
talk
of
beasley
there
i
suppose
it
may
have
been
a
little
embarrassing
for
everybody
especially
if
ann
apperthwaite
heard
ann
that
miss
apperthwaite
yes
i
was
speaking
directly
to
her
why
should
she
have
heard
me
she
talked
of
him
herself
a
little
later
and
at
some
length
she
did
my
cousin
stopped
rocking
and
fixed
me
with
her
glittering
eye
well
of
all
is
it
so
surprising
the
lady
gave
her
boat
to
the
waves
again
ann
apperthwaite
thinks
about
him
still
she
said
with
something
like
vindictiveness
always
suspected
it
she
thought
you
were
new
to
the
place
and
know
anything
about
it
all
or
anybody
to
mention
it
to
that
it
i
still
new
to
the
place
i
urged
and
still
do
know
anything
about
it
they
used
to
be
engaged
was
her
succinct
and
emphatic
answer
i
found
it
but
too
illuminating
oh
oh
i
cried
i
was
an
innocent
was
i
i
glad
she
does
think
of
him
said
my
cousin
it
serves
her
right
i
only
hope
he
wo
find
it
out
because
he
a
poor
faithful
creature
he
jump
at
the
chance
to
take
her
back
and
she
deserve
how
long
has
it
been
i
asked
since
they
used
to
be
engaged
oh
a
good
while
five
or
six
years
ago
i
think
maybe
more
time
skips
along
ann
apperthwaite
no
chicken
you
such
was
the
lady
expression
they
got
engaged
just
after
she
came
home
from
college
and
of
all
the
idiotically
romantic
girls
but
she
a
teacher
i
interrupted
of
she
nodded
wisely
i
always
thought
that
explained
it
the
romance
is
a
reaction
from
the
algebra
i
never
knew
a
person
connected
with
mathematics
or
astronomy
or
statistics
or
any
of
those
exact
things
who
did
have
a
crazy
streak
in
somewhere
they
got
to
blow
off
steam
and
be
foolish
to
make
up
for
putting
in
so
much
of
their
time
at
hard
sense
but
do
you
think
that
i
dislike
ann
apperthwaite
she
always
been
one
of
my
best
friends
that
why
i
feel
at
liberty
to
abuse
her
and
i
always
will
abuse
her
when
i
think
how
she
treated
poor
david
how
did
she
treat
him
threw
him
over
out
of
a
clear
sky
one
night
that
all
just
sent
him
home
and
broke
his
heart
that
is
it
would
have
been
broken
if
he
had
any
kind
of
disposition
except
the
one
the
lord
blessed
him
with
just
all
optimism
and
cheerfulness
and
he
never
cared
for
anybody
else
and
i
guess
he
never
what
did
she
do
it
for
nothing
my
cousin
shot
the
indignant
word
from
her
lips
nothing
in
the
wide
world
but
there
must
have
been
listen
to
me
she
interrupted
and
tell
me
if
you
ever
heard
anything
queerer
in
your
life
they
been
engaged
heaven
knows
how
long
over
two
years
probably
nearer
three
and
always
she
kept
putting
it
off
would
begin
to
get
ready
would
set
a
day
for
the
wedding
then
apperthwaite
died
and
left
her
and
her
mother
stranded
high
and
dry
with
nothing
to
live
on
david
had
everything
in
the
world
to
give
her
and
still
she
would
and
then
one
day
she
came
up
here
and
told
me
she
broken
it
off
said
she
could
stand
it
to
be
engaged
to
david
beasley
another
minute
but
why
because
my
cousin
tone
was
shrill
with
her
despair
of
expressing
the
satire
she
would
have
put
into
it
because
she
said
he
was
a
man
of
no
imagination
she
still
says
so
i
remarked
thoughtfully
then
it
time
she
got
a
little
imagination
herself
snapped
my
companion
david
beasley
the
quietest
man
god
has
made
but
everybody
knows
what
he
is
there
are
some
rare
people
in
this
world
that
all
talk
there
are
some
still
rarer
ones
that
scarcely
ever
talk
at
all
and
david
beasley
one
of
them
i
do
know
whether
it
because
he
ca
talk
or
if
he
can
and
hates
to
i
only
know
he
does
and
i
glad
of
it
and
thank
the
lord
he
put
a
few
like
that
into
this
talky
world
david
beasley
smile
is
better
than
acres
of
other
people
talk
my
providence
would
anybody
just
to
look
at
him
know
that
he
does
better
than
talk
he
thinks
the
trouble
with
ann
apperthwaite
was
that
she
was
too
young
to
see
it
she
was
so
full
of
novels
and
poetry
and
dreaminess
and
highfalutin
nonsense
she
see
anything
as
it
really
was
she
study
her
mirror
and
see
such
a
heroine
of
romance
there
that
she
just
could
bear
to
have
a
fiance
who
had
any
chance
of
turning
out
to
be
the
of
kenosha
in
disguise
at
the
very
least
to
suit
her
he
have
had
to
wear
a
vandyke
and
coo
sonnets
in
the
gloaming
or
read
on
a
balcony
to
her
by
a
red
lamp
poor
david
outside
of
his
i
do
believe
he
ever
read
anything
but
robinson
crusoe
and
the
bible
and
mark
twain
oh
you
should
have
heard
her
talk
about
it
could
bear
it
another
day
she
said
could
stand
it
in
all
the
time
i
known
him
i
believe
he
ever
asked
me
a
single
question
except
when
he
asked
if
i
marry
him
he
never
says
anything
never
speaks
at
all
she
said
do
know
a
blessing
when
you
see
it
i
told
her
she
said
nothing
in
the
man
he
has
no
depths
he
has
any
more
imagination
than
the
chair
he
sits
and
sits
and
sits
in
half
the
time
he
answers
what
i
say
to
him
by
nodding
and
saying
with
that
same
old
foolish
contented
smile
of
his
i
have
gone
mad
if
it
had
lasted
any
longer
i
asked
her
if
she
thought
married
life
consisted
very
largely
of
conversations
between
husband
and
wife
and
she
answered
that
even
married
life
ought
to
have
some
poetry
in
it
romance
she
said
soul
and
he
just
comes
and
sits
she
said
sits
and
sits
and
sits
and
sits
and
i
ca
bear
it
any
longer
and
told
him
so
poor
beasley
i
said
think
ann
apperthwaite
retorted
my
cousin
i
like
to
know
if
there
anything
nicer
than
just
to
sit
and
sit
and
sit
and
sit
with
as
lovely
a
man
as
that
a
man
who
understands
things
and
thinks
and
listens
and
smiles
instead
of
everlastingly
talking
as
it
happens
i
remarked
i
heard
beasley
why
of
course
he
talks
she
returned
when
there
any
real
use
in
it
and
he
talks
to
children
he
that
kind
of
i
meant
a
particular
instance
i
began
meaning
to
see
if
she
could
give
me
any
clew
to
bill
hammersley
and
simpledoria
but
at
that
moment
the
gate
clicked
under
the
hand
of
another
caller
my
cousin
rose
to
greet
him
and
presently
i
took
my
leave
without
having
been
able
to
get
back
upon
the
subject
of
beasley
thus
once
more
baffled
i
returned
to
apperthwaite
and
within
the
hour
came
into
full
possession
of
the
very
heart
of
that
dark
and
subtle
mystery
which
overhung
the
house
next
door
and
so
perplexed
my
soul
iv
finding
that
i
had
still
some
leisure
before
me
i
got
a
book
from
my
room
and
repaired
to
the
bench
in
the
garden
but
i
did
not
read
i
had
but
opened
the
book
when
my
attention
was
arrested
by
sounds
from
the
other
side
of
the
high
fence
low
and
tremulous
croonings
of
distinctly
african
derivation
ah
met
mah
sistuh
in
she
up
de
hill
so
slow
you
mus
git
a
rastle
in
doo
time
de
hevumly
do
cloze
iz
it
was
the
voice
of
an
aged
negro
and
the
simultaneous
slight
creaking
of
a
small
hub
and
axle
seemed
to
indicate
that
he
was
pushing
or
pulling
a
child
wagon
or
perambulator
up
and
down
the
walk
from
the
kitchen
door
to
the
stable
whiles
he
proffered
soothing
music
over
and
over
he
repeated
the
chant
though
with
variations
encountering
in
turn
his
brother
his
daughter
each
of
his
parents
his
uncle
his
cousin
and
his
one
after
the
other
ascending
the
same
slope
with
the
same
perilous
leisure
lay
still
he
interrupted
his
injunctions
to
the
des
keep
on
an
de
air
dass
wha
go
mek
you
good
an
well
then
there
spoke
the
strangest
voice
that
ever
fell
upon
my
ear
it
was
not
like
a
child
neither
was
it
like
a
very
old
person
voice
it
might
have
been
a
grasshopper
it
was
so
thin
and
little
and
made
of
such
tiny
wavers
and
quavers
and
creakings
i
want
said
this
elfin
voice
i
want
bill
hammersley
the
shabby
phaeton
which
had
passed
my
cousin
house
was
drawing
up
to
the
curb
near
beasley
gate
evidently
the
old
negro
saw
it
hi
dar
he
exclaimed
look
at

ah

yod

to

the
small
wagon
creaked
away
the
chant
resuming
as
it
went
dowden
jumped
out
of
the
phaeton
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
to
the
driver
beasley
himself
who
clucked
to
the
horse
and
drove
through
his
open
and
down
the
drive
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
where
he
was
lost
to
my
view
dowden
entering
our
own
gate
nodded
in
a
friendly
fashion
to
me
and
i
advanced
to
meet
him
some
day
i
want
to
take
you
over
next
door
he
said
cordially
as
i
came
up
you
ought
to
know
beasley
especially
as
i
hear
you
doing
some
political
reporting
dave
beasley
going
to
be
the
next
governor
of
this
state
you
he
laughed
offered
me
a
cigar
and
we
sat
down
together
on
the
front
steps
from
all
i
hear
i
rejoined
you
ought
to
know
who
get
it
was
said
in
town
that
dowden
would
come
pretty
near
having
the
nomination
in
his
i
expect
you
thought
i
shifted
the
subject
pretty
briskly
the
other
day
he
glanced
at
me
quizzically
from
under
the
brim
of
his
black
felt
hat
i
meant
to
tell
you
about
that
but
the
opportunity
did
occur
you
see
i
understand
i
interrupted
i
heard
the
story
you
thought
it
might
be
embarrassing
to
miss
i
expect
i
was
pretty
clumsy
about
it
said
dowden
cheerfully
well
well
he
flicked
his
cigar
with
a
smothered
ejaculation
that
was
half
a
sigh
and
half
a
laugh
it
a
mighty
strange
case
here
they
keep
on
living
next
door
to
each
other
year
after
year
each
going
on
alone
when
they
might
just
as
well
he
left
the
sentence
unfinished
save
for
a
vocal
click
of
compassion
they
bow
when
they
happen
to
meet
but
they
have
exchanged
a
word
since
the
night
she
sent
him
away
long
he
shook
his
head
then
his
countenance
cleared
and
he
chuckled
well
sir
dave
got
something
at
home
to
keep
him
busy
enough
these
days
i
expect
do
you
mind
telling
me
i
inquired
is
its
name
dowden
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
loudly
lord
no
what
on
earth
made
you
think
that
i
told
him
it
was
my
second
success
with
this
narrative
however
there
was
a
difference
my
former
auditor
listened
with
flushed
and
breathless
excitement
whereas
the
present
one
laughed
consumedly
throughout
especially
he
laughed
with
a
great
laughter
at
the
picture
of
coming
down
at
four
in
the
morning
to
open
the
door
for
nothing
on
sea
or
land
or
in
the
waters
under
the
earth
i
gave
account
also
of
the
miraculous
jumping
contest
though
i
did
not
mention
miss
having
been
with
me
and
of
the
elfin
voice
i
had
just
now
overheard
demanding
bill
so
i
expect
you
must
have
decided
he
chuckled
when
i
concluded
that
david
beasley
has
gone
just
plain
plum
not
a
bit
of
it
nobody
could
look
at
him
and
not
know
better
than
you
right
there
said
dowden
heartily
and
now
i
tell
you
all
there
is
to
it
you
see
dave
grew
up
with
a
cousin
of
his
named
hamilton
swift
they
were
boys
together
went
to
the
same
school
and
then
to
college
i
do
believe
there
was
ever
a
high
word
spoken
between
them
nobody
in
this
life
ever
got
a
quarrel
out
of
dave
beasley
and
hamilton
swift
was
a
mighty
good
sort
of
a
fellow
too
he
went
east
to
live
after
they
got
out
of
college
yet
they
always
managed
to
get
together
once
a
year
generally
about
you
could
pass
them
on
the
street
without
hearing
their
laughter
ringing
out
louder
than
the
maybe
over
some
old
joke
between
them
or
some
fool
thing
they
did
perhaps
when
they
were
boys
but
finally
hamilton
swift
business
took
him
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
water
to
live
and
he
married
an
english
girl
an
orphan
without
any
kin
that
was
about
seven
years
ago
well
sir
this
last
summer
he
and
his
wife
were
taking
a
trip
down
in
switzerland
and
they
were
both
drowned
tipped
over
out
of
a
rowboat
in
lake
lucerne
and
word
came
that
hamilton
swift
will
appointed
dave
guardian
of
the
one
child
they
had
a
little
boy
hamilton
swift
junior
his
name
he
was
sent
across
the
ocean
in
charge
of
a
doctor
and
dave
went
on
to
new
york
to
meet
him
he
brought
him
home
here
the
very
day
before
you
passed
the
house
and
saw
poor
dave
getting
up
at
four
in
the
morning
to
let
that
ghost
in
and
a
mighty
funny
ghost
simpledoria
is
i
begin
to
understand
i
said
and
to
feel
pretty
silly
not
at
all
he
rejoined
heartily
that
little
chap
freaks
would
mystify
anybody
especially
with
dave
humoring
the
ridiculous
way
he
does
hamilton
swift
junior
is
the
curiousest
child
i
ever
saw
and
the
good
lord
knows
he
made
all
children
powerful
mysterious
this
poor
little
cuss
has
a
complication
of
infirmities
that
have
kept
him
on
his
back
most
of
his
life
never
knowing
other
children
never
playing
or
anything
and
he
got
ideas
and
ways
that
i
never
saw
the
beat
of
he
was
born
sick
as
i
understand
it
his
bones
and
nerves
and
insides
are
all
wrong
somehow
but
it
supposed
he
gets
a
little
better
from
year
to
year
he
wears
a
pretty
elaborate
set
of
braces
and
he
subject
to
attacks
too
i
do
know
the
name
for
and
loses
what
little
voice
he
has
sometimes
all
but
a
whisper
he
had
one
i
know
the
day
after
beasley
brought
him
home
and
that
was
probably
the
reason
you
thought
dave
was
carrying
on
all
to
himself
about
that
out
in
the
the
boy
must
have
been
lying
there
in
the
little
wagon
they
have
for
him
while
dave
cut
up
shines
with
hammersley
of
course
most
children
have
friends
and
companions
especially
if
they
have
any
brothers
or
sisters
but
this
lonely
little
feller
got
his
people
worked
out
in
his
mind
and
materialized
beyond
any
i
ever
heard
of
dave
got
well
acquainted
with
on
the
train
on
the
way
home
and
they
certainly
are
giving
him
a
lively
time
ho
ho
getting
him
up
at
four
in
the
morning
dowden
mirth
overcame
him
for
a
moment
when
he
had
mastered
it
he
continued
simpledoria
now
where
do
you
suppose
he
got
that
name
well
anyway
simpledoria
is
supposed
to
be
hamilton
swift
junior
bernard
dog
beasley
had
to
bathe
him
the
other
day
he
told
me
and
bill
hammersley
is
supposed
to
be
a
boy
of
hamilton
swift
junior
own
age
but
very
big
and
strong
he
has
rosy
cheeks
and
he
can
do
more
in
athletics
than
a
whole
college
that
the
reason
he
outjumped
dave
so
far
you
v
miss
apperthwaite
was
at
home
the
following
saturday
i
found
her
in
the
library
with
les
miserables
on
her
knee
when
i
came
down
from
my
room
a
little
before
and
she
looked
up
and
gave
me
a
smile
that
made
me
feel
sorry
for
any
one
she
had
ceased
to
smile
upon
i
wanted
to
tell
you
i
said
with
a
little
awkwardness
but
plenty
of
truth
i
found
out
that
i
an
awful
but
that
something
she
returned
encouragingly
at
least
the
beginning
of
i
mean
about
beasley
the
mystery
i
was
absurd
enough
to
find
in
i
want
to
tell
you
oh
know
she
said
and
although
she
laughed
with
an
effect
of
carelessness
that
look
which
i
had
thought
far
away
returned
to
her
eyes
as
she
spoke
there
was
a
certain
inscrutability
about
miss
apperthwaite
sometimes
it
should
be
added
as
if
she
did
not
like
to
be
too
easily
read
i
heard
all
about
it
beasley
been
appointed
trustee
or
something
for
poor
hamilton
swift
son
a
pitiful
little
invalid
boy
who
invents
all
sorts
of
characters
the
old
darky
from
over
there
told
our
cook
about
bill
hammersley
and
simpledoria
so
you
see
i
i
glad
you
do
i
said
a
little
hardness
one
might
even
have
thought
it
bitterness
became
apparent
in
her
expression
and
i
glad
there
somebody
in
that
house
at
last
with
a
little
imagination
from
everything
i
have
heard
i
returned
summoning
sufficient
boldness
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
which
has
more
beasley
or
the
her
glance
fell
from
mine
at
this
but
not
quickly
enough
to
conceal
a
sudden
look
of
trouble
i
can
think
of
no
other
way
to
express
it
that
leaped
into
it
and
she
rose
for
the
was
ringing
i
just
finishing
the
death
of
jean
valjean
you
know
in
les
miserables
she
said
as
we
moved
to
the
door
i
always
afraid
cry
over
that
i
try
not
to
because
it
makes
my
eyes
and
in
truth
there
was
a
vague
rumor
of
tears
about
her
eyes
not
as
if
she
had
shed
them
but
more
as
if
she
were
going
to
though
i
had
not
noticed
it
when
i
came
in
that
afternoon
when
i
reached
the
despatch
office
i
was
commissioned
to
obtain
certain
political
information
from
the
honorable
david
beasley
an
assignment
i
accepted
with
eagerness
notwithstanding
the
commiseration
it
brought
me
from
one
or
two
of
my
fellows
in
the
reporter
room
you
wo
get
anything
out
of
him
they
said
and
they
were
true
prophets
i
found
him
looking
over
some
documents
in
his
office
a
reflective
unlighted
cigar
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
his
chair
tilted
back
and
his
feet
on
a
he
nodded
upon
my
statement
of
the
affair
that
brought
me
and
without
shifting
his
position
gave
me
a
look
of
slow
but
wholly
friendly
scrutiny
over
his
shoulder
and
bade
me
sit
down
i
began
at
once
to
put
the
questions
i
was
told
to
ask
him
interrogations
he
seemed
to
believe
satisfactorily
answered
by
slowly
and
ruminatively
stroking
the
left
side
of
his
chin
with
two
long
fingers
of
his
right
hand
the
while
he
smiled
in
genial
contemplation
of
a
tarred
roof
beyond
the
window
now
and
then
he
would
give
me
a
mild
and
drawling
word
or
two
not
brilliantly
illuminative
it
may
be
remarked
well
about
that
he
began
once
and
came
immediately
to
a
full
stop
yes
i
said
hopefully
my
pencil
poised
about
that
i
guess
yes
beasley
i
encouraged
him
for
he
seemed
to
have
dried
up
permanently
well
sir
i
guess
had
you
better
see
some
one
else
about
that
this
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
would
be
but
too
fluent
and
copious
upon
any
subject
in
the
world
except
the
one
particular
point
i
never
met
anybody
else
who
looked
so
pleasantly
communicative
and
managed
to
say
so
little
in
fact
he
did
say
anything
at
all
and
i
guessed
that
this
faculty
was
not
without
its
value
in
his
political
career
disastrous
as
it
had
proved
to
his
private
happiness
his
habit
of
silence
moreover
was
not
cultivated
you
could
see
that
the
secret
of
it
was
just
that
he
was
born
quiet
my
remained
noteless
and
finally
at
some
odd
evasion
of
his
accomplished
by
a
monosyllable
i
laughed
outright
and
he
did
too
he
joined
cachinnations
with
me
heartily
and
with
a
twinkling
quizzicalness
that
somehow
gave
me
the
idea
that
he
might
be
thinking
rather
apologetically
to
himself
yes
sir
that
old
beasley
man
is
certainly
a
mighty
funny
critter
when
i
went
away
a
few
moments
later
and
left
him
still
intermittently
chuckling
the
impression
remained
with
me
that
he
had
had
some
such
deprecatory
and
surreptitious
thought
two
or
three
days
after
that
as
i
started
from
apperthwaite
beasley
came
out
of
his
gate
bound
in
the
same
direction
he
gave
me
a
look
of
gay
recognition
and
offered
his
hand
saying
well
up
in
this
neighborhood
as
if
that
were
a
matter
of
considerable
astonishment
i
mentioned
that
i
was
a
neighbor
and
we
walked
on
together
i
think
he
spoke
again
except
for
a
well
sir
or
two
of
genial
surprise
at
something
i
said
and
now
and
then
you
do
tell
me
which
he
had
a
most
eloquent
way
of
exclaiming
but
he
listened
visibly
to
my
own
talk
and
laughed
at
everything
that
i
meant
for
funny
i
never
knew
anybody
who
gave
one
a
greater
responsiveness
he
seemed
to
be
with
you
every
instant
and
how
he
made
you
feel
it
was
the
true
mystery
of
beasley
this
silent
man
who
never
talked
except
as
my
cousin
said
to
children
it
happened
that
i
thus
met
him
as
we
were
both
starting
and
walked
on
with
him
several
days
in
succession
in
a
word
it
became
a
habit
then
one
afternoon
as
i
turned
to
leave
him
at
the
despatch
office
he
asked
me
if
i
would
drop
in
at
his
house
the
next
day
for
a
cigar
before
we
started
i
did
and
he
asked
me
if
i
would
come
again
the
day
after
that
so
this
became
a
habit
too
a
fortnight
elapsed
before
i
met
hamilton
swift
junior
for
he
poor
little
father
of
could
be
no
spectator
of
track
events
upon
the
lawn
but
lay
in
his
bed
however
he
grew
better
at
last
and
my
presentation
took
place
we
had
just
finished
our
cigars
in
beasley
airy
and
were
rising
to
go
when
there
came
the
faint
creaking
of
small
wheels
from
the
hall
beasley
turned
to
me
with
the
apologetic
and
monosyllabic
chuckle
that
was
distinctly
his
alone
i
got
a
little
chap
here
he
said
then
went
to
the
door
bob
the
old
darky
appeared
in
the
doorway
pushing
a
little
wagon
like
a
on
wheels
and
in
it
sat
hamilton
swift
junior
my
first
impression
of
him
was
that
he
was
all
eyes
i
could
look
at
anything
else
for
a
time
and
was
hardly
conscious
of
the
rest
of
that
weazened
peaked
little
face
and
the
wisp
of
a
body
with
its
pathetic
adjuncts
of
metal
and
leather
i
think
they
were
the
brightest
eyes
i
ever
saw
as
keen
and
intelligent
as
a
wicked
old
woman
withal
as
trustful
and
cheery
as
the
eyes
of
a
setter
pup
thus
the
honorable
beasley
waving
a
handkerchief
thrice
around
his
head
and
thrice
cheering
and
the
child
in
that
cricket
voice
of
his
replied
this
was
the
form
of
salutation
familiarly
in
use
between
them
beasley
followed
it
by
inquiring
who
with
us
i
mister
swift
chirped
the
little
fellow
swift
if
you
please
cousin
david
beasley
executed
a
formal
bow
there
is
a
gentleman
here
who
like
to
meet
and
he
presented
me
with
some
grave
phrases
commendatory
of
my
general
character
addressing
the
child
as
mister
swift
whereupon
mister
swift
gave
me
a
ghostly
little
hand
and
professed
himself
glad
to
meet
me
and
besides
me
he
added
to
beasley
there
bill
hammersley
and
corley
a
faint
perplexity
manifested
itself
upon
beasley
face
at
this
a
shadow
which
cleared
at
once
when
i
asked
if
i
might
not
be
permitted
to
meet
these
personages
remarking
that
i
had
heard
from
dowden
of
bill
hammersley
though
until
now
a
stranger
to
the
fame
of
corley
linbridge
beasley
performed
the
ceremony
with
intentional
elegance
while
the
boy
great
eyes
swept
glowingly
from
his
cousin
face
to
mine
and
back
again
i
bowed
and
shook
hands
with
the
air
once
to
my
left
and
once
to
my
right
and
simpledoria
cried
mister
swift
you
enjoy
above
all
things
i
said
can
he
shake
hands
some
dogs
watch
him
mister
swift
lifted
a
commanding
finger
simpledoria
shake
hands
i
knelt
beside
the
wagon
and
shook
an
imaginary
big
paw
at
this
mister
swift
again
shook
hands
with
me
and
allowed
me
to
perceive
in
his
luminous
regard
a
solemn
commendation
and
approval
in
this
wise
was
my
initiation
into
the
beautiful
old
house
and
the
cordiality
of
its
inmates
completed
and
i
became
a
familiar
of
david
beasley
and
his
ward
with
the
privilege
to
go
and
come
as
i
pleased
there
was
always
gay
and
friendly
welcome
i
always
came
for
the
cigar
after
lunch
sometimes
for
lunch
itself
sometimes
i
dined
there
instead
of
and
now
and
then
when
it
happened
that
an
errand
or
assignment
took
me
that
way
in
the
afternoon
i
would
run
in
and
visit
awhile
with
hamilton
swift
junior
and
his
circle
of
friends
there
were
days
of
course
when
his
attacks
were
upon
him
and
only
beasley
and
the
doctor
and
old
bob
saw
him
i
do
not
know
what
the
mental
condition
was
at
such
times
but
when
he
was
better
and
could
be
wheeled
about
the
house
and
again
receive
callers
he
displayed
an
almost
dismaying
activity
of
mind
it
was
active
enough
certainly
to
keep
far
ahead
of
my
own
and
he
was
masterful
still
beasley
and
dowden
and
i
were
never
directly
chidden
for
insubordination
though
made
to
wince
painfully
by
the
look
of
troubled
surprise
that
met
us
when
we
were
not
quick
enough
to
catch
his
meaning
the
order
of
the
day
with
him
always
began
with
the
and
of
greeting
after
which
we
were
to
inquire
who
with
us
whereupon
he
would
make
known
the
character
in
which
he
elected
to
be
received
for
the
occasion
if
he
announced
himself
as
mister
swift
everything
was
to
be
very
and
decorous
indeed
formalities
and
distances
were
observed
and
corley
linbridge
an
elderly
personage
of
great
dignity
and
distinction
as
a
was
much
oftener
included
in
the
conversation
than
bill
hammersley
if
however
he
declared
himself
to
be
hamilton
swift
junior
which
was
his
happiest
mood
bill
hammersley
and
simpledoria
were
in
the
ascendant
and
there
were
games
and
contests
dowden
beasley
and
i
all
slid
down
the
banisters
on
one
of
the
hamilton
swift
junior
days
at
which
really
picturesque
spectacle
the
boy
almost
cried
with
laughter
and
old
bob
and
his
wife
who
came
running
from
the
kitchen
did
cry
he
had
a
third
appellation
for
himself
just
little
hamilton
but
this
was
only
when
the
creaky
voice
could
hardly
chirp
at
all
and
the
weazened
face
was
drawn
to
one
side
with
suffering
when
he
told
us
he
was
just
little
hamilton
we
were
very
quiet
once
for
ten
days
his
invisibles
all
went
away
on
a
visit
hamilton
swift
junior
had
become
interested
in
bears
while
this
lasted
all
of
beasley
trousers
were
as
dowden
said
a
for
that
matter
dowden
himself
was
quite
hoarse
in
court
from
growling
so
much
the
bears
were
dismissed
abruptly
bill
hammersley
and
corley
linbridge
and
simpledoria
came
trooping
back
and
with
them
they
brought
that
wonderful
family
the
hunchbergs
beasley
had
just
opened
the
front
door
returning
at
noon
from
his
office
when
hamilton
swift
junior
voice
came
piping
from
the
library
where
he
was
reclining
in
his
wagon
by
the
window
cousin
david
beasley
cousin
david
come
he
cried
come
the
hunchbergs
are
here
of
course
cousin
david
beasley
came
and
was
immediately
introduced
to
the
whole
hunchberg
family
a
ceremony
which
old
bob
who
was
with
the
boy
had
previously
undergone
with
courtly
grace
they
like
bob
explained
hamilton
do
you
hunchberg
yes
he
says
they
do
extremely
he
used
such
words
as
extremely
often
indeed
as
dowden
said
he
talked
like
a
child
in
a
book
which
was
due
i
dare
say
to
his
english
mother
and
i
sure
the
boy
went
on
that
all
the
family
will
admire
cousin
david
yes
hunchberg
says
he
thinks
they
and
then
as
bob
told
me
he
went
almost
out
of
his
head
with
joy
when
beasley
offered
hunchberg
a
cigar
and
struck
a
match
for
him
to
light
it
but
whar
exclaimed
the
old
darky
whar
in
de
name
o
de
good
gawd
do
de
chile
git
dem
names
hit
lak
to
skeer
me
that
was
a
subject
often
debated
between
dowden
and
me
there
was
nothing
in
wainwright
that
could
have
suggested
them
and
it
did
not
seem
probable
he
could
have
remembered
them
from
over
the
water
in
my
opinion
they
were
the
inventions
of
that
busy
and
lonely
little
brain
i
met
the
hunchberg
family
myself
the
day
after
their
arrival
and
beasley
by
that
time
had
become
so
well
acquainted
with
them
that
he
could
remember
all
their
names
and
helped
in
the
introductions
there
was
hunchberg
evidently
the
child
favorite
for
he
was
described
as
the
possessor
of
every
engaging
virtue
and
there
was
that
lively
matron
hunchberg
there
were
the
hunchberg
young
gentlemen
tom
noble
and
grandee
and
the
young
ladies
miss
queen
miss
marble
and
miss
molanna
all
exceedingly
gay
and
pretty
there
was
also
colonel
hunchberg
an
uncle
finally
there
was
aunt
cooley
hunchberg
a
somewhat
decrepit
but
very
amiable
old
lady
corley
linbridge
happened
to
be
calling
at
the
same
time
and
as
it
appeared
to
be
beasley
duty
to
keep
the
conversation
going
and
constantly
to
include
all
of
the
party
in
its
general
flow
it
struck
me
that
he
had
truly
as
dowden
said
enough
to
keep
him
the
hunchbergs
had
lately
moved
to
wainwright
from
constantinople
i
learned
they
had
decided
not
to
live
in
town
however
having
purchased
a
fine
farm
out
in
the
country
and
on
account
of
the
distance
were
able
to
call
at
beasley
only
about
eight
times
a
day
and
seldom
more
than
twice
in
the
evening
whenever
a
mystic
telephone
announced
that
they
were
on
the
way
the
child
would
have
himself
wheeled
to
a
window
and
when
they
came
in
sight
he
would
cry
out
in
wild
delight
while
beasley
hastened
to
open
the
front
door
and
admit
them
they
were
so
real
to
the
child
and
beasley
treated
them
with
such
consistent
seriousness
that
between
the
two
of
them
i
sometimes
began
to
feel
that
there
actually
were
such
people
and
to
have
moments
of
that
i
could
see
them
particularly
as
each
of
the
hunchberg
developed
a
character
entirely
his
own
to
the
last
peculiarity
such
as
the
aged
aunt
cooley
hunchberg
deafness
on
which
account
beasley
never
once
forgot
to
raise
his
voice
when
he
addressed
her
indeed
the
details
of
actuality
in
all
this
appeared
to
bring
as
great
a
delight
to
the
man
as
to
the
child
certainly
he
built
them
up
with
infinite
care
on
one
occasion
when
hunchberg
and
i
happened
to
be
calling
hamilton
remarked
with
surprise
that
simpledoria
had
come
into
the
room
without
licking
his
hand
as
he
usually
did
and
had
crept
under
the
table
hunchberg
volunteered
the
information
through
beasley
that
upon
his
approach
to
the
house
he
had
seen
simpledoria
chasing
a
cat
it
was
then
debated
whether
chastisement
was
in
order
but
finally
decided
that
simpledoria
surreptitious
manner
of
entrance
and
his
hiding
under
the
table
were
sufficient
indication
that
he
well
understood
his
baseness
and
would
never
let
it
happen
again
and
so
beasley
having
coaxed
him
out
from
under
the
table
the
offender
sat
up
begged
and
was
forgiven
i
could
almost
feel
the
splendid
shaggy
head
under
my
hand
when
in
turn
i
patted
simpledoria
to
show
that
the
reconciliation
was
unanimous
vi
autumn
trailed
the
last
leaves
behind
her
flying
brown
robes
one
night
we
woke
to
a
skurry
of
snow
next
morning
and
it
was
winter
along
the
sidewalks
the
merchants
set
lines
of
poles
covered
them
with
evergreen
and
ran
streamers
of
green
overhead
to
encourage
the
festal
shopping
salvation
army
santa
clauses
stamped
their
feet
and
rang
bells
on
the
corners
and
children
fixed
their
noses
immovably
to
for
them
the
season
of
seasons
the
time
of
times
was
at
hand
to
a
certain
new
reporter
on
the
despatch
the
stir
and
gayety
of
the
streets
meant
little
more
than
that
the
days
had
come
when
it
was
night
in
the
afternoon
and
that
he
was
given
fewer
political
assignments
this
was
annoying
because
beasley
candidacy
for
the
governorship
had
given
me
a
personal
interest
in
the
political
situation
the
nominating
convention
of
his
party
would
meet
in
the
spring
the
nomination
was
certain
to
carry
the
election
also
and
thus
far
beasley
showed
more
strength
than
any
other
man
in
the
field
things
are
looking
his
way
said
dowden
he
always
worked
hard
for
the
party
not
on
the
stump
of
course
he
laughed
but
the
boys
understand
there
are
more
important
things
than
his
record
in
congress
gave
him
the
confidence
of
everybody
in
the
state
and
besides
that
people
always
trust
a
quiet
man
i
tell
you
if
nothing
happens
he
get
i
fer
beasley
another
politician
explained
in
an
interview
because
he
dave
beasley
yes
sir
i
fer
him
you
know
the
boys
say
if
a
man
is
only
for
you
in
this
state
there
is
much
in
it
and
he
may
go
back
on
it
but
if
he
fer
you
he
means
it
well
i
fer
beasley
there
were
other
candidates
of
course
none
of
them
formidable
but
i
was
surprised
to
learn
of
the
existence
of
a
small
but
energetic
faction
opposing
our
friend
in
wainwright
his
own
town
what
are
you
surprised
about
inquired
dowden
do
you
know
what
our
folks
are
like
yet
if
paul
lived
in
wainwright
do
you
suppose
he
could
run
for
constable
without
some
of
his
near
neighbors
getting
out
to
try
and
down
him
the
head
and
front
and
backbone
too
of
the
opposition
to
beasley
was
a
sort
of
man
one
named
simeon
peck
he
possessed
no
inconsiderable
influence
i
heard
was
a
hard
worker
and
vigorously
seconded
by
an
energetic
lieutenant
a
young
man
named
grist
these
and
others
they
had
been
able
to
draw
to
their
faction
were
bitterly
and
eagerly
opposed
to
nomination
and
worked
without
ceasing
to
prevent
it
i
quote
the
invaluable
dowden
again
grist
against
us
because
he
had
a
quarrel
with
a
clerk
in
beasley
office
and
wanted
beasley
to
discharge
him
and
beasley
would
sim
peck
against
us
out
of
just
plain
and
because
he
never
was
for
anything
nor
fer
anybody
in
his
life
i
had
a
talk
with
the
old
the
other
day
he
said
our
candidate
ought
to
be
a
farmer
a
of
the
common
people
and
when
i
asked
him
where
he
find
anybody
more
a
of
the
common
people
than
beasley
he
said
beasley
was
much
of
a
society
man
to
suit
him
the
idea
of
dave
as
a
man
was
too
much
for
me
and
i
laughed
in
sim
peck
face
but
that
did
stop
sim
peck
look
at
the
style
he
lives
in
he
yelped
he
fairly
lapped
in
luxury
look
at
that
big
house
he
lives
in
look
at
the
way
he
goes
around
in
that
phaeton
of
his
and
a
nigger
to
drive
him
half
the
time
i
had
to
holler
again
and
of
course
that
made
sim
twice
as
mad
as
he
started
out
to
be
and
he
went
off
swearing
he
show
me
before
the
campaign
was
over
the
only
trouble
he
and
grist
and
that
crowd
could
give
us
would
be
by
finding
out
something
against
dave
and
they
do
that
because
there
is
anything
to
find
i
shared
his
confidence
on
this
latter
score
but
was
somewhat
less
sanguine
on
some
others
there
were
only
two
newspapers
of
any
political
influence
in
wainwright
the
despatch
and
the
journal
both
operated
in
the
interest
of
beasley
party
and
neither
had
come
out
for
him
the
gossip
i
heard
about
our
office
led
me
to
think
that
each
was
waiting
to
see
what
headway
sim
peck
and
his
faction
would
make
the
journal
especially
i
knew
had
some
inclination
to
coquette
with
peck
grist
and
company
altogether
their
faction
was
not
entirely
to
be
despised
thus
my
thoughts
were
a
great
deal
more
occupied
with
beasley
chances
than
with
the
holiday
spirit
that
now
with
furs
and
bells
and
wreathing
mists
of
snow
breathed
good
cheer
over
the
town
so
little
indeed
had
this
spirit
touched
me
that
one
evening
when
one
of
my
colleagues
standing
before
the
in
the
reporters
room
yawned
and
said
he
be
glad
when
was
over
i
asked
him
what
was
the
particular
trouble
with
christmas
he
explained
languidly
always
so
tedious
like
it
makes
me
homesick
said
another
a
melancholy
little
man
who
was
forever
bragging
of
his
native
duluth
christmas
i
repeated
it
was
christmas
eve
and
i
had
not
known
it
i
leaned
back
in
my
chair
in
sudden
loneliness
what
pictures
coming
before
me
of
christmas
eves
at
home
old
christmas
eves
when
there
was
a
tree
my
name
was
called
the
night
city
editor
had
an
assignment
for
me
go
up
to
sim
peck
on
madison
street
he
said
he
thinks
he
got
something
on
david
beasley
but
wo
say
any
more
over
the
telephone
see
what
there
is
in
i
picked
up
my
hat
and
coat
and
left
the
office
at
a
speed
which
must
have
given
my
superior
the
highest
conception
of
my
journalistic
zeal
at
a
telephone
station
on
the
next
corner
i
called
up
apperthwaite
house
and
asked
for
dowden
what
are
you
doing
i
demanded
when
his
voice
had
responded
playing
bridge
he
answered
are
you
going
out
anywhere
no
what
the
trouble
i
tell
you
later
i
may
want
to
see
you
before
i
go
back
to
the
all
right
i
be
here
all
i
hung
up
the
receiver
and
made
off
on
my
errand
the
streets
were
crowded
with
the
people
bending
heads
and
shoulders
to
the
bitter
wind
which
swept
a
blinding
snow
horizontally
against
them
at
corners
it
struck
so
tumultuous
a
blow
upon
the
chest
of
the
pedestrians
that
for
a
moment
it
would
halt
them
and
you
could
hear
them
gasping
ahs
like
bathers
in
a
heavy
surf
yet
there
was
a
gayety
in
this
eager
gale
the
crowds
pressed
anxiously
yet
happily
up
and
down
the
street
in
their
generous
search
for
things
to
give
away
it
was
not
the
rich
who
struggled
through
the
storm
these
were
people
who
carried
their
own
bundles
home
you
saw
them
toilers
and
savers
tired
mothers
and
fathers
worn
with
the
grinding
thrift
of
all
the
year
but
now
for
this
one
night
careless
of
how
the
money
reckless
of
everything
but
the
joy
of
giving
it
to
bring
the
children
joy
on
the
one
great
so
they
bent
their
heads
to
the
freezing
wind
their
arms
laden
with
daring
bundles
and
their
hearts
uplifted
with
the
tremulous
happiness
of
giving
more
than
they
could
afford
meanwhile
simeon
peck
honest
man
had
chosen
this
season
to
work
harm
if
he
might
to
the
gentlest
of
his
i
found
peck
waiting
for
me
at
his
house
there
were
four
other
men
with
him
one
of
whom
i
recognized
as
grist
a
squat
young
man
with
black
hair
and
a
lambrequin
mustache
they
were
donning
their
coats
and
hats
in
the
hall
when
i
arrived
from
the
hay
peck
gave
me
greeting
as
he
wound
a
knit
comforter
about
his
neck
that
good
we
most
give
you
up
this
here
mr
grist
and
henry
cullop
and
gus
schulmeyer
three
men
that
feel
the
same
way
about
dave
beasley
that
i
do
that
other
young
feller
he
waved
a
mittened
hand
to
the
fourth
man
he
from
the
likely
you
the
young
man
from
the
was
unknown
to
me
moreover
i
was
far
from
overjoyed
at
his
presence
i
got
you
newspaper
men
here
continued
peck
because
goin
to
show
you
about
dave
beasley
that
open
a
good
many
folk
eyes
when
it
in
well
what

sharply

little
bit
he
retorted
grist
and
me

do
cullop
and
schulmeyer
and
i
goin
to
take
them
and
you
two
reporters
to
look
at
it
all
ready
then
come
he
threw
open
the
door
stooped
to
the
gust
that
took
him
by
the
throat
and
led
the
way
out
into
the
storm
what
is
he
up
to
i
gasped
to
the
journal
man
as
we
followed
in
a
straggling
line
i
do
know
any
more
than
you
do
he
returned
he
thinks
he
got
something
that
queer
beasley
peck
an
old
fool
but
it
just
possible
he
got
hold
of
something
nearly
everybody
has
one
thing
at
least
that
they
do
want
found
out
it
may
be
a
good
story
lord
what
a
night
i
pushed
ahead

me
you

to
show
dowden
i
said
you

to
take
him
on
this
expedition

peck
emitted
an
acrid
bark
of
laughter
i
guess
he
at
beasley
all
no
he
is
he
at
home
at
apperthwaite
playing
what
i
happen
to
know
that
he
be
there
all
peck
smote
his
palms
together
grist
he
called
over
his
shoulder
and
his
colleague
struggled
forward
listen
to
this
even
dowden
ai
at
beasley
ai
the
lord
workin
fer
us
why
do
you
take
dowden

i
urged
if
there

you
want
to
show
him
by
george
i
will
shouted
peck
i
got
him
where
the
hair
short
now
that
right
said
grist
gentlemen
peck
turned
to
the
others
when
we
git
to
apperthwaite
jest
stop
outside
along
the
fence
a
minute
i
recken
we
pick
up
a
shivering
we
took
up
our
way
again
in
single
file
stumbling
through
drifts
that
had
deepened
incredibly
within
the
hour
the
wind
was
straight
against
us
and
so
stingingly
sharp
and
so
laden
with
the
driving
snow
that
when
we
reached
apperthwaite
gate
which
we
approached
from
the
north
not
passing
beasley
my
eyes
were
so
full
of
smarting
tears
i
could
see
only
blurred
planes
of
light
dancing
vaguely
in
the
darkness
instead
of
brightly
lit
windows
now
said
peck
panting
and
turning
his
back
to
the
wind
the
rest
of
you
gentlemen
wait
out
here
you
two
newspaper
men
you
come
with
he
opened
the
gate
and
went
in
the
journal
reporter
and
i
following
all
three
of
us
wiping
our
eyes
when
we
reached
the
shelter
of
the
front
porch
i
took
the
key
from
my
pocket
and
opened
the
door
i
live
here
i
explained
to
peck
all
right
he
said
jest
step
in
and
tell
george
dowden
that
sim
peck
out
here
and
wants
to
see
him
at
the
door
a
minute
be
i
went
into
the
library
and
there
sat
dowden
contemplatively
playing
bridge
with
two
of
the
elderly
ladies
and
miss
apperthwaite
the
person
quite
took
my
breath
away
in
honor
of
the
christmas
eve
i
supposed
she
wore
an
evening
dress
of
black
lace
and
the
only
word
for
what
she
looked
has
suffered
such
misuse
that
one
hesitates
over
it
yet
that
is
what
she
was
regal
and
no
less
there
was
a
sort
of
splendor
about
her
it
detracted
nothing
from
this
that
her
expression
was
a
little
sad
something
not
uncommon
with
her
lately
a
certain
melancholy
faint
but
detectable
like
breath
on
a
mirror
i
had
attributed
it
to
jean
valjean
though
perhaps
it
might
have
been
due
merely
to
bridge
what
is
it
asked
dowden
when
after
an
apology
for
disturbing
the
game
i
had
drawn
him
out
in
the
hall
i
motioned
toward
the
front
door
simeon
peck
he
thinks
he
got
something
on
beasley
he
waiting
to
see
dowden
uttered
a
sharp
exclamation
and
stepped
quickly
to
the
door
peck
he
said
as
he
jerked
it
open
oh
i
here
declared
that
gentleman
stepping
into
view
i
come
around
to
let
you
know
that
you
could
laugh
like
a
horse
at
me
no
more
george
dowden
so
you
were
invited
invited
said
dowden
where
over
to
the
ball
your
friend

what
friend
dave
beasley
so

ai
quite
good
enough
to
dance
with
his
friends
what
are
you
talking
about
dowden
demanded
impatiently
i
reckon
you
wo
be
quite
so
strong
fer
beasley
responded
peck
with
a
vindictive
little
giggle
when
you
find
he
can
use
you
in
his
business
but
when
it
comes
to
entertainin
oh
no
you
ai
quite
the
boy
i
appreciate
your
explaining
said
dowden
it
kind
of
cold
standing
peck
laughed
shrilly
then
i
reckon
you
better
git
your
hat
and
coat
and
come
along
ca
do
us
no
harm
and
might
be
an
fer
you
grist
and
gus
schulmeyer
and
hank
cullop
waitin
out
yonder
at
the
gate
we
havin
kind
of
a
consultation
at
my
house
over
grist
seen
at
beasley
a
little
earlier
in
the
what
did
grist
see
hacks
hacks
drivin
up
to
beasley
house
a
whole
lot
of
grist
was
down
the
street
a
piece
and
it
was
pretty
dark
but
he
could
see
the
lamps
and
hear
the
doors
slam
as
the
people
got
out
besides
the
whole
place
is
lit
up
from
cellar
to
attic
grist
come
on
to
my
house
and
told
me
about
it
and
i
begun
usin
the
telephone
called
up
all
the
men
that
count
in
the
party
found
most
of
at
home
too
i
ast
if
they
was
invited
to
this
ball
and
not
a
one
of
was
they
only
in
politics
they
ai
high
society
enough
to
be
ast
to
beasley
but
i
would
thought
he
let
you
in
anyways
fer
the
second
table
peck
shrilled
out
his
acrid
and
exultant
laugh
again
i
got
these
fellers
from
the
newspapers
and
all
i
want
is
to
git
this
here
ball
in
print
and
see
what
the
boys
that
do
the
work
at
the
primaries
have
to
say
about
it
and
what
their
wives
say
about
the
man
that
too
to
have
in
his
house
i
bet
beasley
thought
he
was
goin
to
keep
these
quiet
afraid
the
farmers
might
not
believe
he
jest
the
plain
man
he
sets
up
to
be
afraid
that
folks
like
you
that
ai
invited
might
turn
against
him
i
fool
him
we
goin
to
see
what
there
is
to
see
and
i
goin
to
have
these
boys
from
the
newspapers

a
full
account
of
it
if
you
want
to
come
along
i
expect
it
do
you
a
power
o
i
go
said
dowden
quickly
he
got
his
coat
and
hat
from
a
table
in
the
hall
and
we
rejoined
the
huddled
and
shivering
group
at
the
gate
got
my
recruit
gents
shrilled
peck
slapping
dowden
boisterously
on
the
shoulders
i
reckon
he
git
a
change
of
heart
and
now
sheltering
my
eyes
from
the
stinging
wind
i
saw
what
i
had
been
too
blind
to
see
as
we
approached
apperthwaite
house
was
illuminated
every
window
up
stairs
and
down
was
aglow
with
rosy
light
that
was
luminously
evident
although
the
shades
were
lowered
look
at
that
peck
turned
to
dowden
giggling
triumphantly
wha
i
tell
you
how
do
you
feel
about
it
now
but
where
are
the
hacks
asked
dowden
gravely
folks
all
come
answered
peck
with
complete
assurance
wo
be
no
more
hacks
till
they
begin
to
go
we
plunged
ahead
as
far
as
the
corner
of
beasley
fence
where
peck
stopped
us
again
and
we
drew
together
slapping
our
hands
and
stamping
our
feet
peck
was
delighted
a
thoroughly
happy
man
his
sour
giggle
of
exultation
had
become
continuous
and
the
same
jovial
break
was
audible
in
grist
voice
as
he
said
to
the
journal
reporter
and
me
go
ahead
boys
git
your
story
we
wait
here
fer
the
journal
reporter
started
toward
the
gate
he
had
gone
perhaps
twenty
feet
when
simeon
peck
whistled
in
sharp
warning
the
reporter
stopped
short
in
his
tracks
beasley
front
door
was
thrown
open
and
there
stood
beasley
himself
in
evening
dress
bowing
and
smiling
but
not
at
us
for
he
did
not
see
us
the
bright
hall
behind
him
was
beautiful
with
evergreen
streamers
and
wreaths
and
great
flowering
plants
in
jars
a
strain
of
wandered
out
to
us
as
the
door
opened
but
there
was
nobody
except
david
beasley
in
sight
which
certainly
seemed
peculiar
for
a
ball
rest
of
inside
dancin
explained
peck
crouching
behind
the
i
bet
the
house
is
half
full
o
wimmin
sh
said
grist
beasley
had
begun
to
speak
and
his
voice
loud
and
clear
sounded
over
the
wind
come
right
in
colonel
he
said
i
have
sent
a
carriage
for
you
if
you
had
telephoned
me
this
afternoon
that
your
rheumatism
was
so
bad
you
did
expect
to
be
able
to
come
i
glad
you
well
again
yes
they
all
here
and
the
ladies
are
getting
up
a
quadrille
in
the
it
was
at
this
moment
that
i
received
upon
the
calf
of
the
right
leg
a
kick
the
ecstatic
violence
of
which
led
me
to
attribute
it
to
mr
dowden
gentlemen
to
the
right
colonel
called
beasley
as
he
closed
the
door
there
was
a
pause
of
awed
silence
among
us
i
improved
it
by
returning
the
kick
to
dowden
he
made
no
acknowledgment
of
its
reception
other
than
to
sink
his
chin
a
little
deeper
into
the
collar
of
his
ulster
by
the
almighty
said
simeon
peck
hoarsely
who
what
was
dave
beasley
talkin
to
there
was
nobody
there
git
out
grist
bade
him
but
his
tone
was
perturbed
he
seen
that
reporter
he
was
givin
us
the
he
crazy
exclaimed
peck
vehemently
immediately
all
four
members
of
his
party
began
to
talk
at
the
same
time
schulmeyer
agreeing
with
grist
and
cullop
holding
with
peck
that
beasley
had
surely
become
insane
while
the
journal
man
returning
was
certain
that
he
had
not
been
seen
argument
became
a
wrangle
excitement
over
the
remarkable
scene
we
had
witnessed
and
perhaps
a
certain
sharpness
partially
engendered
by
the
risk
of
freezing
led
to
some
bitterness
high
words
were
flung
upon
the
wind
eventually
simeon
peck
got
the
floor
to
himself
for
a
moment
see
here
boys
there
no
use
gittin
mad
amongs
ourselves
he
vociferated
one
thing
we
all
agreed
on
nobody
here
never
seen
no
such
a
dam
peculiar
performance
as
we
jest
seen
in
their
whole
lives
before
thurfore
ball
or
no
ball
there
mighty
wrong
about
this
business
ai
that
so
they
said
it
was
well
then
there
only
one
thing
to
do
let
find
out
what
it
you
bet
we
i
would
send
no
one
in
there
alone
peck
went
on
excitedly
with
a
crazy
man
besides
i
want
to
see
what
goin
on
so
do
we
this
was
unanimous
then
let
see
if
there
ai
some
way
to
do
it
perhaps
he
pulled
all
the
shades
down
on
the
other
side
the
house
lots
o
people
fergit
to
do
there
was
but
one
mind
in
the
party
regarding
this
proposal
the
next
minute
saw
us
all
cautiously
sneaking
into
the
side
yard
a
ragged
line
of
bent
and
flapping
figures
black
against
the
snow
simeon
peck
expectations
were
fulfilled
more
than
fulfilled
not
only
were
all
the
shades
of
the
big
of
the
lifted
but
evidently
on
account
of
the
too
great
generosity
of
a
huge
that
blazed
in
the
one
of
the
windows
was
as
well
here
in
the
shadow
just
beyond
the
rosy
oblongs
of
light
that
fell
upon
the
snow
we
gathered
and
looked
freely
within
part
of
the
room
was
clear
to
our
view
though
about
half
of
it
was
shut
off
from
us
by
the
very
king
of
all
glittering
with
dozens
and
dozens
of
candles
sumptuous
in
silver
sparkling
in
gold
and
laden
with
heaven
alone
knows
how
many
and
what
delectable
enticements
opposite
the
tree
his
back
against
the
wall
sat
old
bob
clad
in
a
dress
of
state
part
of
which
consisted
of
a
coat
with
an
overgrown
chrysanthemum
in
the
buttonhole
a
red
necktie
and
a
liberty
cap
of
he
was
scraping
a
fiddle
like
old
times
come
again
and
the
tune
he
played
was
oh
my
liza
po
gal
my
feet
shuffled
to
it
in
the
snow
no
one
except
old
bob
was
to
be
seen
in
the
room
but
we
watched
him
and
listened
breathlessly
when
he
finished
liza
he
laid
the
fiddle
across
his
knee
wiped
his
face
with
a
new
and
brilliant
blue
silk
handkerchief
and
said
now
come
de
big
the
honorable
david
beasley
carrying
a
small
mahogany
table
stepped
out
from
beyond
the
advanced
to
the
centre
of
the
room
set
the
table
down
disappeared
for
a
moment
and
returned
with
a
white
and
a
glass
he
placed
these
upon
the
table
bowed
gracefully
several
times
then
spoke
ladies
and
gentlemen
there
he
paused
well
said
simeon
peck
slowly
do
this
beat
hell
look
out
the
journal
reporter
twitched
his
sleeve
ladies
where
said
i
he
leaned
nearer
me
and
spoke
in
a
low
tone
just
behind
us
she
followed
us
over
from
your
she
been
standing
around
near
us
all
along
i
supposed
she
was
dowden
daughter
he
has
any
daughter
i
said
and
stepped
back
to
the
hooded
figure
i
had
been
too
absorbed
in
our
quest
to
notice
it
was
miss
apperthwaite
she
had
thrown
a
loose
cloak
over
her
head
and
shoulders
but
enveloped
in
it
as
she
was
and
crested
and
epauletted
with
white
i
knew
her
at
once
there
was
no
mistaking
her
even
in
a
blizzard
she
caught
my
hand
with
a
strong
quick
pressure
and
bending
her
head
to
mine
said
close
to
my
ear
i
heard
everything
that
man
said
in
our
hallway
you
left
the
library
door
open
when
you
called
dowden
so
i
returned
maliciously
you
you
could
help
following
she
released
my
hand
gently
to
my
surprise
hush
she
whispered
he
saying
ladies
and
gentlemen
said
beasley
again
and
stopped
again
dowden
voice
sounded
hysterically
in
my
right
ear
miss
apperthwaite
had
whispered
in
my
left
the
only
speech
he
ever
made
in
his
life
and
he
stuck
but
beasley
was
he
was
only
deliberating
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
began
mr
and
hunchberg
colonel
hunchberg
and
aunt
cooley
hunchberg
miss
molanna
miss
queen
and
miss
marble
hunchberg
noble
tom
and
grandee
hunchberg
corley
linbridge
and
master
hammersley
you
see
before
you
my
person
merely
the
representative
of
your
real
host
mister
swift
mister
swift
has
expressed
a
wish
that
there
should
be
a
speech
and
has
deputed
me
to
make
it
he
requests
that
the
subject
he
has
assigned
me
should
be
treated
in
as
dignified
a
manner
as
is
possible
considering
the
orator
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
took
a
sip
of
water
i
will
now
address
you
upon
the
following
subject
we
call
the
best
time
is
the
best
time
because
it
is
the
kindest
time
nobody
ever
felt
very
happy
without
feeling
very
kind
and
nobody
ever
felt
very
kind
without
feeling
at
least
a
little
happy
so
of
course
either
way
about
the
happiest
time
is
the
kindest
time
that
this
time
the
most
beautiful
things
our
eyes
can
see
are
the
stars
and
for
that
reason
and
in
remembrance
of
one
star
we
set
candles
on
the
tree
to
be
stars
in
the
house
so
we
make
a
time
of
stars
indoors
and
they
shine
warmly
against
the
cold
outdoors
that
is
like
the
cold
of
other
seasons
not
so
kind
we
set
our
hundred
candles
on
the
tree
and
keep
them
bright
throughout
the
for
while
they
shine
upon
us
we
have
light
to
see
this
life
not
as
a
battle
but
as
the
march
of
a
mighty
fellowship
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
thank
you
he
bowed
to
right
and
left
as
to
an
audience
politely
applauding
and
lifting
the
table
and
its
burden
withdrew
while
old
bob
again
set
his
fiddle
to
his
chin
and
scraped
the
preliminary
measures
of
a
quadrille
beasley
was
back
in
an
instant
shouting
as
he
came
take
your
pardners
balance
all
and
then
and
there
and
all
by
himself
he
danced
a
quadrille
performing
at
one
and
the
same
time
for
four
lively
couples
never
in
my
life
have
i
seen
such
gyrations
and
capers
as
were
cut
by
that
miraculously
flying
figure
he
was
in
the
wildest
motion
without
cessation
never
the
fraction
of
an
instant
still
calling
the
figures
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
dancing
them
simultaneously
his
expression
anxious
but
polite
as
is
the
habit
of
other
dancers
his
hands
extended
as
if
to
swing
his
partner
or
corner
or
opposite
lady
and
his
feet
lifting
high
and
flapping
down
in
an
step
first
four
forward
and
back
he
shouted
forward
and
salute
balance
to
corners
swing
pardners
i
think
the
combination
of
abandon
and
decorum
with
which
he
performed
that
grand
was
the
funniest
thing
i
have
ever
seen
but
i
did
laugh
at
it
neither
did
miss
apperthwaite
now
do
you
believe
me
peck
was
arguing
fiercely
with
schulmeyer
is
he
crazy
or
ai
he
he
is
grist
agreed
hoarsely
he
is
a
stark
starin
ravin
roarin
lunatic
and
the
nigger
humorin
him
they
were
all
staring
and
aghast
into
the
lighted
room

simeon
peck
rasping
voice
rose
high

it
they
shook
hands
exalted
with
triumph
this
do
the
work
giggled
peck
it
about
per
cent
better
than
the
story
we
started
to
git
why
dave
beasley
be
in
a
padded
cell
in
a
month
it
be
all
over
town
and
he
have
as
much
chance
fer
governor
as
that
nigger
in
there
in
his
ecstasy
he
smote
dowden
deliriously
in
the
ribs
what
do
you
think
of
your
candidate
now
wait
said
dowden
who
came
in
the
hacks
that
grist
saw
this
staggered
peck
he
rubbed
his
mitten
over
his
woollen
cap
as
if
scratching
his
head
why
he
said
slowly
who
in
halifax
did
come
in
them
hacks
the
hunchbergs
said
i
who
the
hunchbergs
where
listen
said
dowden
first
couple
face
out
shouted
beasley
facing
out
with
an
invisible
lady
on
his
akimboed
arm
while
old
bob
sawed
madly
at
a
new
coon
in
town
second
couple
fall
in
beasley
wheeled
about
and
enacted
the
second
couple
third
couple
he
fell
in
behind
himself
again
fourth
couple
if
you
please
balance
all
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
molanna
i
afraid
i
stepped
on
your
sashay
all
after
the
sashay
the
noblest
and
most
dashing
bit
of
gymnastics
displayed
in
the
whole
quadrille
he
bowed
profoundly
to
his
invisible
partner
and
came
to
a
pause
wiping
his
streaming
face
old
bob
dexterously
swung
a
new
coon
into
the
stately
measures
of
a
triumphal
march
and
now
beasley
announced
in
stentorian
tones
if
the
ladies
will
be
so
kind
as
to
take
the
gentlemen
arms
we
will
proceed
to
the
and
partake
of
a
slight
thereupon
came
a
slender
piping
of
joy
from
that
part
of
the
room
screened
from
us
by
the
tree
oh
cousin
david
beasley
that
was
the
beautifullest
quadrille
ever
danced
in
the
world
and
please
wo
you
take
hunchberg
out
to
supper
then
into
the
vision
of
our
paralyzed
and
dumfounded
watchers
came
the
little
wagon
pulled
by
the
old
colored
woman
bob
wife
in
her
best
and
there
propped
upon
pillows
lay
hamilton
swift
junior
his
soul
shining
rapture
out
of
his
great
eyes
a
bright
spot
of
color
on
each
of
his
thin
cheeks
he
lifted
himself
on
one
elbow
and
for
an
instant
something
seemed
to
be
wrong
with
the
brace
under
his
chin
beasley
sprang
to
him
and
adjusted
it
tenderly
then
he
bowed
elaborately
toward
the
mrs
hunchberg
he
said
may
i
have
the
honor
and
offered
his
arm
and
i
must
have
mister
hunchberg
chirped
hamilton
he
must
walk
with
he
tells
me
said
beasley
he
be
mighty
glad
to
and
there
a
plate
of
bones
for
you
lead
the
way
cried
the
child
you
and
are
we
all
in
line
beasley
glanced
back
over
his
shoulder
now
let
us
on
ho
there
applauded
mister
swift
and
beasley
his
head
thrown
back
and
his
chest
out
proudly
led
the
way
stepping
nobly
and
in
time
to
the
exhilarating
measures
hamilton
swift
junior
towed
by
the
beaming
old
mammy
followed
in
his
wagon
his
thin
little
arm
uplifted
and
his
fingers
curled
as
if
they
held
a
trusted
hand
when
they
reached
the
door
old
bob
rose
turned
in
after
them
and
still
fiddling
played
the
procession
and
himself
down
the
hall
and
so
they
marched
away
and
we
were
left
staring
into
the
empty
room
my
soul
said
the
journal
reporter
gasping
and
he
did
all
that
just
to
please
a
little
sick
kid
i
ca
figure
it
out
murmured
sim
peck
piteously
can
said
the
journal
reporter
this
story
will
be
all
over
town
he
glanced
at
me
and
i
nodded
it
be
all
over
town
he
continued
though
not
in
any
of
the
papers
and
i
believe
it
going
to
hurt
dave
beasley
chances
peck
and
his
companions
turned
toward
the
street
they
went
silently
the
young
man
from
the
journal
overtook
them
thank
you
for
sending
for
me
he
said
cordially
you
given
me
a
treat
i
fer
beasley
dowden
put
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
he
had
not
observed
the
third
figure
still
remaining
well
sir
he
remarked
shaking
the
snow
from
his
coat
they
were
right
about
one
thing
it
certainly
was
mighty
low
down
of
dave
not
to
invite
me
and
you
too
to
his
christmas
party
let
him
go
to
thunder
with
his
old
invitations
i
going
in
anyway
come
on
i
plum
there
was
a
side
door
just
beyond
the
and
dowden
went
to
it
and
rang
loud
and
long
it
was
beasley
himself
who
opened
it
what
in
the
name
he
began
as
the
ruddy
light
fell
upon
face
and
upon
me
standing
a
little
way
behind
what
are
you
two
what
on
earth
are
you
fellows
doing
out
here
we
come
to
your
christmas
party
you
old
thus
dowden
said
beasley
dowden
turned
to
me
are
you
coming
what
are
you
waiting
for
old
fellow
said
beasley
i
waited
a
moment
longer
and
then
it
happened
she
came
out
of
the
shadow
and
went
to
the
foot
of
the
steps
her
cloak
falling
from
her
shoulders
as
she
passed
me
i
picked
it
up
she
lifted
her
arms
pleadingly
though
her
head
was
bent
with
what
seemed
to
me
a
beautiful
sort
of
shame
she
stood
there
with
the
snow
driving
against
her
and
did
not
speak
beasley
drew
his
hand
slowly
across
his
eyes
to
see
if
they
were
really
there
i
think
david
she
said
at
last
you
got
so
many
lovely
people
in
your
house

there
room
for
for
just
one
fool
