this
volume
is
said
to
abound
in
wit
and
humour
very
little
can
now
be
added
to
this
obituary
notice
which
appeared
in
the
for
april
the
young
irishman
whose
death
it
records
was
born
at
cork
in
received
his
education
chiefly
in
london
addicted
himself
to
the
law
and
was
early
diverted
into
the
profession
of
letters
which
he
practised
with
great
energy
and
versatility
besides
the
works
mentioned
above
he
wrote
a
romance
called
rising
and
a
farcical
comedy
full
of
noise
and
bustle
called
wife
what
wife
the
choice
of
this
last
phrase
sacred
if
any
words
in
poetry
are
sacred
for
the
title
of
a
rollicking
farce
indicates
a
certain
bluntness
of
sensibility
in
the
author
he
was
young
and
fell
head
over
ears
in
love
with
cleverness
he
was
a
and
took
to
political
satire
as
a
duck
takes
to
the
rain
he
was
an
irishman
and
found
himself
the
master
of
a
happy
irish
wit
clean
quick
and
dainty
but
no
ways
searching
or
profound
at
the
back
of
all
his
satire
there
lies
a
simple
social
creed
which
he
accepts
from
the
code
of
his
own
time
and
does
not
question
the
two
of
his
works
which
achieved
something
like
fame
a
and
here
reprinted
set
forth
that
creed
describing
the
ideal
heroine
in
verse
and
warning
her
in
prose
against
the
extravagances
that
so
easily
beset
her
the
mode
in
female
character
has
somewhat
changed
since
george
was
king
and
the
pensive
coyness
set
up
as
a
model
in
the
poem
seems
to
a
modern
reader
almost
as
affected
as
the
vagaries
described
in
the
novel
yet
the
poem
has
all
the
interest
and
brilliancy
of
an
old
here
is
woman
as
she
wished
to
be
in
the
days
of
the
regency
or
perhaps
as
man
wished
her
to
be
for
it
is
impossible
to
say
which
began
it
both
gloried
in
the
contrast
of
their
habits
if
man
in
that
age
of
the
and
the
was
a
drinking
swearing
fighting
animal
his
indelicacy
was
redeemed
by
the
shrinking
graces
of
his
mate
for
woman
is
not
undevelopt
man
but
diverse
as
the
poet
of
the
later
nineteenth
century
sings
but
tennyson
was
anticipated
in
this
discovery
by
barrett
yes
heaven
a
contrast
not
unmeet
designed
between
the
bearded
and
the
blushing
kind
those
who
often
see
the
bearded
kind
clad
in
overcoats
carrying
umbrellas
and
timorous
of
social
greetings
may
have
some
difficulty
in
recognizing
the
essential
truth
of
the
following
lines
which
describe
man
in
his
grandeur
as
his
blushing
consort
loves
to
think
of
him
man
from
those
moments
when
his
infant
age
cried
for
the
moon
ambitious
aims

with

nocturnal
clouds

such

man
all
magnificence
and
terror
and
now
a
softly
trilling
note
ushers
in
the
partner
of
his
cares
but
the
meek

from

o

gentle
peace

their
studies
are
as
dissimilar
as
their
tastes
nothing
less
than
a
comet
will
excite
the
curiosity
of
man
for
woman
the
is
science
enough
prone
abstruse
research
let
man
expound
dark
causes
what
abyss
our
planet
drowned
and
where
the
fiery
star
its
hundred
years
of
absence
travels
ere
it

best

profound
imparts
his

his
should
tell
how
thunderbolts
and
her
how
roses
fell
here
is
the
genesis
of
the
early
victorian
ideal
of
female
beauty
the
author
describes
with
sentiment
its
graces
and
charms
the
beautiful
rebuke
that
looks
surprise
the
gentle
vengeance
of
averted
eyes
which
last
line
so
pleased
him
that
it
occurs
again
in
letter
xxv
of
the
shorter
poem
like
the
longer
has
the
indescribable
charm
of
a
pressed
an
elegant
tarnished
mirror
a
faded
silken
fan
a
vanished
mode
the
secret
of
this
sentimental
type
of
beauty
perhaps
lies
here
that
the
simplicity
and
shyness
and
ardour
of
youth
are
reduced
not
by
a
conscious
science
but
by
the
timid
rules
of
propriety
and
modesty
to
the
service
of
an
coquetry
ovid
as
expounded
by
chapone
or
miss
hannah
more
gains
something
in
the
delicacy
of
his
methods
and
loses
nothing
of
his
empire
ut
quondam
iuvenes
ita
nunc
mea
turba
puellae
inscribant
spoliis
naso
magister
erat
it
must
be
said
however
that
the
author
of
a
does
not
confine
himself
to
the
alluring
graces
his
best
known
and
most
quoted
lines
are
written
in
praise
of
courage
and
fidelity
not
she
denied
her
god
with
recreant
tongue
not
she
with
traitrous
kisses
round
him
clung
she
while
apostles
shrank
could
danger
brave
last
at
his
cross
and
earliest
at
his
grave
if
he
were
to
survive
in
a
single
quotation
it
is
probably
by
these
lines
that
the
author
who
spent
much
labour
on
the
revision
and
polishing
of
his
poem
would
wish
to
be
remembered
it
may
seem
strange
that
the
author
of
this
romantic
poem
on
woman
should
have
been
so
ready
to
parody
the
new
school
of
prose
romance
miss
cherry
wilkinson
when
she
took
the
name
of
cherubina
and
commenced
heroine
might
certainly
have
found
some
useful
hints
for
her
behaviour
in
this
earlier
treatise
but
the
fact
is
that
no
parodist
is
successful
who
has
not
at
some
time
fallen
deeply
under
the
spell
of
the
literature
that
he
parodies
parody
is
for
the
most
part
a
weak
and
clinging
kind
of
tribute
to
the
force
of
its
original
very
perfect
parodies
which
catch
the
soul
as
well
as
the
form
of
the
models
that
they
imitate
almost
lose
their
identity
and
become
a
part
of
that
which
they
were
meant
to
ridicule
feeble
parodies
where
poor
matter
not
strong
enough
to
speak
for
itself
claims
notice
by
the
aid
of
a
notorious
tune
are
even
more
conspicuously
dependent
on
the
vogue
of
their
original
the
art
of
a
tailor
is
seen
in
the
cut
of
a
coat
to
make
a
mechanical
copy
of
it
substituting
tartan
or
fustian
for
velvet
is
what
any
chinese
slave
can
do
it
is
form
in
literature
which
is
difficult
to
invent
when
a
poem
or
a
story
by
the
individuality
and
novelty
of
its
form
has
caught
the
public
taste
there
are
always
some
among
its
victims
who
are
nothing
if
not
critical
they
can
not
forget
it
yet
it
does
not
content
them
they
think
it
narrow
and
partial
in
its
conception
it
does
not
mirror
nature
exactly
as
they
see
her
in
short
they
have
ideas
of
their
own
these
ideas
perhaps
have
not
vitality
enough
to
create
their
own
definite
form
so
when
a
form
is
presented
to
them
they
seize
on
it
for
their
purpose
hence
every
new
and
original
kind
in
literature
produces
a
tribe
of
imitators
some
of
them
contented
imitators
who
undersell
the
first
author
with
colourable
copies
others
discontented
imitators
or
parodists
who
offer
their
own
substitute
for
the
author
wares
yet
stamp
it
with
his
brand
the
compliment
is
the
same
in
either
case
and
the
effect
is
not
much
different
for
nothing
so
quickly
exhausts
the
popularity
of
a
work
of
art
as
its
power
of
multiplying
its
kind
some
congenital
weakness
it
is
fair
to
say
there
must
have
been
in
the
original
when
the
form
designed
for
a
single
purpose
serves
so
many
others
the
weakness
is
not
always
easy
to
detect
but
it
is
always
there
it
may
be
the
weakness
of
excess
an
ample
and
robe
like
walt
whitman
is
characteristic
of
its
wearer
but
can
soon
be
adapted
to
a
borrower
or
it
may
be
the
weakness
of
defect
the
music
and
solemnity
of
the
of
are
a
world
too
wide
for
the
shrunken
body
of
the
thought
that
they
conceal
a
perfect
conception
expressing
itself
inevitably
in
the
form
that
has
grown
with
its
growth
defies
imitators
the
great
things
of
virgil
and
of
dante
suffer
no
parody
and
this
is
what
is
meant
by
a
classic
yet
lesser
books
have
their
day
and
young
authors
or
old
authors
trying
a
new
kind
of
work
often
begin
by
imitation
they
discover
their
genius
by
their
failure
the
famous
parodies
so
to
call
them
are
not
parodies
at
all
their
freedom
from
the
servility
of
parody
is
what
has
given
them
their
place
in
literature
cervantes
may
have
thought
that
he
could
criticize
and
banter
the
romances
of
chivalry
by
telling
the
adventures
of
a
poor
and
gentleman
travelling
on
the
roads
of
spain
but
once
the
new
situation
was
created
it
called
for
a
new
treatment
fielding
doubtless
intended
to
parody
richardson
by
a
tale
of
the
chastity
of
a
and
it
is
easy
to
see
how
a
mere
wit
would
have
carried
out
the
design
but
fielding
like
cervantes
was
too
rich
in
ideas
and
too
brave
in
purpose
to
be
another
man
mocking
servitor
first
slipslop
incommodes
the
framework
by
her
intrusion
and
then
parson
adams
enters
to
complete
the
disaster
the
breakdown
of
these
pretended
parodies
is
always
due
to
the
same
cause
the
appearance
on
an
artificially
designed
scene
of
real
character
character
where
it
is
fully
conceived
will
not
take
its
orders
from
the
it
reacts
in
surprising
ways
to
slight
accidental
provocations
it
will
not
play
the
part
or
speak
the
words
assigned
to
it
it
is
consistent
with
nothing
but
itself
from
it
soon
passes
to
and
subdues
the
world
to
its
will
disordering
all
the
it
can
not
be
claimed
for
eaton
stannard
barrett
that
he
proved
superior
to
the
task
which
he
undertook
there
is
little
or
no
real
character
in
perhaps
jerry
sullivan
the
faithful
irish
servitor
with
his
ready
speech
and
bold
resourcefulness
comes
nearest
to
the
life
but
even
he
is
drawn
like
lever
comic
irishmen
not
intimately
a
few
touches
of
verisimilitude
are
sufficient
to
portray
a
servant
whose
business
is
to
come
when
he
is
called
and
to
help
others
in
their
necessities
the
heroine
herself
has
no
breath
in
her
she
is
inconceivably
credulous
impossibly
ignorant
and
even
while
she
talks
the
author
often
forgets
her
very
existence
and
speaks
in
her
stead
so
that
she
seems
to
be
quizzing
her
own
fatuity
perhaps
this
incompetent
portraiture
was
to
be
expected
from
the
author
of
a
but
it
takes
some
of
the
edge
off
the
fun
of
the
book
cherubina
is
not
a
girl
with
silly
flighty
notions
in
her
head
such
as
romance
engenders
but
a
pedantic
female
lawyer
determined
to
order
her
life
down
to
the
smallest
detail
on
precedents
borrowed
from
her
favourite
reading
miss
austen
girls
in
talk
like
girls
cherubina
talks
like
a
book
nevertheless
miss
austen
herself
read
and
confessed
to
the
pleasure
she
had
from
it
it
enjoyed
a
high
and
brief
reputation
the
first
edition
appeared
in
the
second
followed
it
in
the
space
of
a
year
and
in
the
author
before
he
was
thirty
years
old
may
have
read
a
notice
of
himself
in
the
dictionary
of
the
living
authors
of
great
britain
and
concluding
with
the
following
eulogy
work
has
been
pronounced
not
inferior
in
wit
and
humour
to
tristram
shandy
and
in
point
of
plot
and
interest
infinitely
beyond
don
quixote
let
us
save
what
remnants
we
can
of
this
monstrous
pronouncement
of
character
as
has
been
said
there
is
next
to
none
in
so
that
only
those
who
can
read
and
careless
of
the
characters
portrayed
might
possibly
be
able
to
return
a
verdict
on
the
comparison
there
are
many
readers
of
books
who
grudge
labour
spent
on
the
long
colloquies
between
don
quixote
and
sancho
or
between
my
uncle
toby
and
corporal
trim
they
would
be
glad
to
see
abbreviated
so
they
might
get
back
to
the
confusion
and
bustle
of
life
why
all
this
dissection
of
the
heart
while
there
are
crowns
to
be
broke
what
the
soldier
said
is
not
evidence
it
is
what
he
did
that
they
desire
to
hear
for
readers
of
this
temper
there
is
abundance
of
entertainment
in
if
once
they
can
bring
themselves
to
accept
the
perilously
slender
illusion
the
scenes
described
are
as
full
of
movement
as
a
harlequinade
no
irish
fair
is
richer
in
incident
and
there
is
such
a
flow
of
high
spirits
the
author
carries
the
whole
business
through
with
such
unflagging
zest
that
the
farce
though
it
hardly
ever
touches
on
the
confines
of
comedy
is
pleasant
farce
instinct
with
good
nature
and
good
fellowship
those
who
like
a
book
that
saves
them
from
the
more
exacting
companionship
of
their
own
thoughts
might
do
worse
than
read
this
is
lukewarm
praise
but
the
book
has
a
stronger
claim
than
this
on
the
interest
of
the
reader
it
marks
a
crisis
in
literary
history
the
author
was
a
man
and
all
the
fashionable
literature
of
his
day
is
reflected
in
his
pages
he
was
familiar
with
the
essayists
and
moralists
of
the
eighteenth
century
indeed
he
often
falls
into
their
attitude
in
his
opposition
to
the
extravagances
of
the
romantic
movement
his
parody
of
johnson
later
style
is
one
of
the
very
best
of
the
multitude
of
johnsonian
imitations
boswell
writing
before
was
able
to
enumerate
a
distinguished
array
of
disciples
and
copyists
among
them
hugh
blair
professor
of
rhetoric
at
edinburgh
george
colman
the
elder
robertson
the
historian
gibbon
miss
burney
barbauld
henry
mackenzie
vicesimus
knox
and
last
john
young
professor
of
greek
at
glasgow
whose
on
the
elegy
written
in
a
country
being
a
continuation
of
criticism
on
the
poems
of
is
rightly
praised
by
boswell
as
the
most
perfect
of
all
professed
imitations
of
johnson
style
it
is
only
half
a
parody
johnson
method
in
criticism
has
been
so
thoroughly
assimilated
by
the
author
that
some
of
johnson
strong
sense
filters
in
here
and
there
as
if
by
oversight
horace
walpole
said
of
it
acutely
enough
that
the
author
seemed
to
wish
to
be
taken
by
gray
admirers
for
a
ridiculer
of
johnson
and
by
admirers
for
a
censurer
of
gray
but
if
this
is
the
best
imitation
of
johnson
critical
manner
his
biographical
style
and
his
light
occasional
verse
have
never
been
so
happily
mimicked
as
in
the
of
james
higginson
by
which
occur
in
letter

of
johnson
continued
to
be
the
most
influential
teacher
of
english
prose
until
macaulay
by
introducing
a
more
glittering
kind
of
antithesis
and
a
freer
use
of
the
weapons
of
offence
in
criticism
usurped
his
supremacy
a
more
voluminous
and
easier
literature
had
enthralled
the
popular
taste
for
some
thirty
or
forty
years
before
the
author
of
delivered
his
attack
only
a
few
are
now
remembered
even
by
name
of
that
horde
of
romances
which
issued
from
the
cheap
presses
in
the
train
of
radcliffe
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
that
many
of
them
which
had
not
the
help
of
that
great
preservative
of
a
bad
book
good
binding
have
perished
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth
they
are
not
yet
old
enough
to
be
precious
as
elizabethan
trash
is
precious
and
doubtless
the
surviving
copies
of
some
of
them
are
even
now
being
cast
out
from
and
remote
country
libraries
to
suffer
their
fate
by
fire
their
names
are
scattered
plentifully
up
and
down
the
and
other
monumental
compilations
where
books
that
go
under
in
their
fight
against
time
have
christian
burial
and
a
little
headstone
reserved
for
them
in
only
the
chief
of
them
are
referred
to
by
name
the
romances
of
radcliffe
mysteries
of
and
bravo
of
are
praised
as
being
captivating
and
seldom
detrimental
the
rivals
of
radcliffe
who
wrote
those
enormously
popular
works
children
of
the
and
of
receive
a
less
respectful
treatment
at
the
close
of
his
book
the
author
of
summarizes
his
indictment
against
these
and
their
kind
present
us
with
incidents
and
characters
which
we
can
never
meet
in
the
world
and
act
upon
the
mind
like
intoxicating
stimulants
first
elevate
and
then
enervate
it
they
teach
us
to
revel
in
ideal
scenes
of
transport
and
distraction
and
harden
our
hearts
against
living
misery
by
making
us
so
refined
as
to
feel
disgust
at
its
unpoetical
accompaniments
throughout
the
book
he
keeps
up
a
running
fire
of
criticism
when
cherubina
visits
westminster
abbey
is
the
first
she
says
i
have
ever
seen
though
i
had
read
of
thousands
she
apologizes
for
using
the
vulgar
word
know
that
a
mere
home
is
my
horror
she
confesses
that
she
is
very
inadequately
armed
with
religion
knew
nothing
of
religion
except
from
novels
and
in
these
though
the
devotion
of
heroines
is
sentimental
and
graceful
to
a
degree
it
never
influences
their
acts
or
appears
connected
with
their
moral
duties
it
is
so
speculative
and
generalized
that
it
would
answer
the
greek
or
the
persian
church
as
well
as
the
christian
and
none
but
the
picturesque
and
enthusiastic
part
is
presented
such
as
kissing
a
cross
chanting
a
vesper
with
elevated
eyes
or
composing
a
prayer
the
notable
thing
is
that
this
attack
on
the
novels
of
the
day
was
not
an
isolated
protest
it
expressed
the
general
mind
and
echoed
the
current
opinion
miss
austen
with
more
suavity
and
art
had
long
before
said
the
same
thing
the
romance
was
declining
it
had
become
a
cheap
mechanical
thing
and
the
mind
of
the
nation
was
turning
away
from
it
to
reinstate
those
teachers
of
moral
prudence
whose
influence
had
been
impaired
by
the
flood
but
not
destroyed
if
any
one
had
been
rash
enough
in
the
year
to
prophesy
the
future
of
literature
he
would
have
been
justified
in
saying
that
to
all
appearances
the
prose
romance
was
dead
it
had
fallen
into
its
dotage
and
the
hand
of
eaton
stannard
barrett
had
killed
it
seemed
to
mark
the
end
of
an
age
of
romance
and
the
beginning
of
a
new
era
of
sententious
prose
such
a
prophet
would
have
been
approved
by
edinburgh
and
all
the
best
judges
of
the
time
he
would
have
been
wrong
for
he
could
not
foresee
the
accident
of
genius
walter
scott
like
cherubina
whose
adventures
he
read
and
applauded
had
fallen
a
victim
to
the
fascinations
of
the
writers
of
romance
yet
unlike
her
had
not
allowed
them
to
deprive
him
of
all
acquaintance
with
more
useful
class
of
composition
and
the
toils
of
active
life
romance
was
what
he
cared
for
and
he
brought
the
sobriety
and
learning
of
a
judge
to
the
task
of
vindicating
his
affection
he
proved
that
the
old
romantic
stories
are
convincing
enough
if
only
the
blood
of
life
flows
through
them
his
great
panoramas
of
history
are
exhibited
in
the
of
a
in
place
of
the
feeble
comic
interest
of
the
earlier
romances
he
supplied
a
rich
and
various
tissue
of
national
character
and
manners
ancient
legend
and
song
fable
and
superstition
live
again
in
his
work
and
as
if
cherubina
unhappy
experiences
had
all
been
in
vain
there
is
always
a
heroine
the
readers
who
had
been
laughed
into
scepticism
by
the
wit
of
the
enemy
were
within
a
few
years
won
back
to
poetry
and
romance
cherubina
was
deposed
and
in
her
place
there
reigned

for
i

you

but
i
am
a
corporeal

and
an

know
that
the
moment

out
in

and
the

or

annexed
thereto
whatever
characters
happen
to

sketched
in
it
whether
imaginary
biographical
or
historical
acquire
the
quality
of
creating
and
effusing
a
sentient
soul
or
spirit
which
instantly
takes
flight
and
ascends
through
the
regions
of
air
till
it
arrives
at
the
moon
where
it
is
then
embodied
and
becomes
a
living
creature
the
precise
counterpart
in
mind
and
person
of
its
literary
prototype
know
farther
that
all
the
towns
villages
rivers
hills
and
vallies
of
the
moon
owe
their
origin
in
a
similar
manner
to
the
descriptions
given
by
writers
of
those
on
earth
and
that
all
the
lunar
trades
and
manufactures
fleets
and
coins
stays
for
men
and
boots
for
ladies
receive
form
and
substance
here
from
terrestrial
books
on
war
and
commerce
pamphlets
on
bullion
and
fashionable
magazines
works
consisting
of
abstract
argument
ethics
metaphysics
polemics
which
from
their
very
nature
can
not
become
tangible
essences
send
up
their
ideas
in
whispers
to
the
moon
where
the
tribe
of
talking
birds
receive
and
repeat
them
for
the
lunarians
so
that
it
is
not
unusual
to
hear
a
mitred
parrot
screaming
a
political
sermon
or
a
fashionable
jay
twittering
unfigurative
canzonets
these
birds
then
are
our
philosophers
and
so
great
is
their
value
that
they
sell
for
as
much
as
your
patriots
the
moment
however
that
a
book
becomes
obsolete
on
earth
the
personages
countries
manners
and
things
recorded
in
it
lose
by
the
law
of
sympathy
their
existence
in
the
moon
this
most
grave
reader
is
but
a
short
and
imperfect
sketch
of
the
way
we
moonites
live
and
die
i
shall
now
give
you
some
account
of
what
has
happened
to
me
since
my
coming
hither
it
is
something
more
than
three
lunar
hours
or
in
other
words
about
three
terrestrial
days
ago
that
owing
to
the
kindness
of
some
human
gentleman
or
other
to
whom
i
take
this
opportunity
of
returning
my
grateful
thanks
i
became
conscious
of
existence
like
the
miltonic
eve
almost
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
peep
into
the
water
and
admire
my
face
a
very
pretty
one
i
assure
you
dear
reader
i
then
perceived
advancing
a
lank
and
grimly
figure
in
armour
who
introduced
himself
as
don
quixote
and
we
soon
found
each
other
kindred
souls
we
walked
hand
in
hand
through
a
beautiful
tract
of
country
called
terra
fertilitatis
for
your
selenographers
langrenus
florentius
grimaldus
ricciolus
and
hevelius
of
dantzic
have
given
proper
names
to
the
various
portions
of
our
hemisphere
as
i
proceeded
i
met
the
radcliffian
rochian
and
other
heroines
but
they
tossed
their
heads
and
told
me
pertly
that
i
was
a
slur
on
the
sisterhood
while
some
went
so
far
as
to
say
i
had
a
design
upon
their
lives
they
likewise
shunned
the
edgeworthian
heroines
whom
they
thought
too
comic
moral
and
natural
i
met
the
lady
of
the
lake
and
shook
hands
with
her
but
her
hand
felt
rather
hard
from
the
frequent
use
of
the
oar
and
i
spoke
to
the
widow
dido
but
she
had
her
old
trick
of
turning
on
her
heel
without
answering
a
civil
question
i
found
the
homeric
achilles
broiling
his
own
beefsteaks
as
usual
the
homeric
princesses
drawing
water
and
washing
linen
the
virgilian
trojans
eating
their
tables
and
the
livian
hannibal
melting
mountains
with
the
patent
vinegar
of
an
advertisement
the
little
boy
in
the
æneid
had
introduced
the
amusement
of
whipping
tops
and
musidora
had
turned
at
a
halfpenny
a
dip
a
cæsar
an
alexander
and
an
alfred
were
talking
politics
and
quaffing
the
horatian
falernian
at
the
garter
inn
of
shakespeare
a
catiline
was
holding
forth
on
reform
and
a
hanno
was
advising
the
recall
of
a
victorious
army
as
i
walked
along
a
parcel
of
moonites
fresh
from
your
newspapers
just
popped
up
their
heads
nodded
and
died
about
twenty
statesmen
come
to
us
in
this
way
almost
every
day
and
though
some
of
them
are
of
the
same
name
and
drawn
from
the
same
original
they
are
often
as
unlike
each
other
as
so
many
clouds
the
buonapartes
thus
sent
are
in
general
hideous
fellows
however
your
parliamentary
reports
sometimes
agreeably
surprise
us
with
most
respectable
characters
of
that
name
on
my
way
i
could
observe
numbers
of
patients
dying
according
as
the
books
that
had
created
them
were
sinking
into
oblivion
the
foxian
james
was
paraded
about
in
a
sedan
chair
and
considered
just
gone
and
a
set
of
politicians
entitled
all
the
talents
who
had
once
made
a
terrible
noise
among
us
lay
sprawling
in
their
last
agonies
but
the
most
extensive
mortality
ever
known
here
was
caused
by
the
burning
of
the
alexandrian
library
this
forms
quite
an
æra
in
the
lunar
annals
and
it
is
called
the
great
conflagration
i
had
attempted
to
pluck
an
apple
from
a
tree
that
grew
near
the
road
but
to
my
surprise
grasped
a
vacuum
and
while
don
quixote
was
explaining
to
me
that
this
phænomenon
arose
from
the
berkeleian
system
of
immaterialism
and
that
this
apple
was
only
a
globular
idea
i
heard
a
squeaking
voice
just
beside
me
cry
must
remark
madam
that
the
writer
who
sent
you
among
us
had
far
too
much
to
say
and
too
little
to
do
i
looked
round
but
saw
nobody
junius
observed
don
quixote
was
invisible
on
earth
and
therefore
must
be
so
here
do
not
mind
his
bitter
sayings
author
continued
the
satirist
has
judgment
enough
to
write
wit
should
have
judgment
enough
to
prevent
him
from
writing
it
said
don
quixote
by
his
works
of
wit
he
can
attain
popularity
he
will
ensure
a
future
attention
to
his
works
of
judgment
so
here
is
at
thee
caitiff
and
closing
his
visor
he
ran
atilt
at
pure
space
cried
junius
us
not
quarrel
though
we
differ
mind
unopposed
by
mind
fashions
false
opinions
of
its
own
and
degenerates
from
its
original
rectitude
the
stagnant
pool
resolves
into
putridity
it
is
the
conflict
of
the
waters
which
keeps
them
pure
in
dropsical
cases
i
presume
said
tristram
shandy
who
just
then
came
up
with
his
uncle
toby
goes
it
heroine
how
goes
it
by
the
man
in
the
moon
the
moment
i
heard
of
your
arrival
here
i
gave
three
exulting
flourishes
of
my
hand
thus
then
applying
my
middle
finger
to
my
thumb
and
compressing
them
by
means
of
the
flexory
muscles
i
shot
them
asunder
transversely
so
that
the
finger
coming
plump
upon
the
aponeurosis
in
short
for
i
do
much
like
the
manner
in
which
i
am
getting
on
with
the
description
i
snapped
my
fingers
madam
i
will
bet
the
whole
of
kristmanus
capuanus
schihardus
phocylides
and
hanzelius
estates
which
are
the
best
on
our
disk
to
as
much
landed
property
as
could
be
shovelled
into
your
shoe
that
you
will
get
miserably
mauled
by
their
reverences
the
scotch
reviewers
my
life
for
it
these
lads
will
say
that
your
character
is
a
mere
daub
drawn
in
distemper
the
colouring
too
rich
the
hair
too
golden
an
eyelash
too
much
then
that
the
book
itself
has
too
little
of
the
rational
and
argumentative
that
the
fellow
merely
wrote
it
to
make
the
world
laugh
which
an
please
your
reverences
is
the
gravest
occupation
an
author
can
chuse
that
some
of
its
incidents
are
plastered
as
thick
as
butter
on
the
bread
of
mamma
darling
others
so
diluted
that
they
wash
down
the
bread
and
butter
most
unpalatably
and
the
rest
unconducive
to
the
plot
moral
and
peripeteia
in
short
madam
it
will
appear
that
the
work
has
every
fault
which
must
convict
it
aristotellically
and
edinburgo
reviewically
in
the
eyes
of
barbati
but
which
will
leave
it
not
the
part
of
a
gry
the
worse
in
the
eyes
of
fifteen
millions
of
honest
englishmen
besides
several
very
respectable
ladies
and
gentlemen
yet
unborn
and
nations
yet
undiscovered
who
will
read
translations
of
it
in
languages
yet
unspoken
bless
me
what
hacking
they
will
have
at
you
small
sword
and
broad
sword
staff
and
stiletto
flankonnade
and
cannonade
right
wing
and
left
wing
but
tristram
paused
short
in
consternation
for
his
animated
description
of
a
fight
had
roused
the
military
spirits
of
don
quixote
and
captain
shandy
who
were
already
at
hard
knocks
the
one
with
his
spear
and
the
other
with
his
crutch
i
therefore
took
this
occasion
of
escaping
and
now
day
begins
to
decline
and
your
globe
which
never
sets
to
us
will
soon
shed
her
pale
earthshine
over
the
landscape
o
how
serene
how
lovely
these
regions
here
are
no
hurricanes
or
clouds
or
vapours
here
heroines
can
not
sigh
for
here
there
is
no
air
to
sigh
withal
here
in
our
great
pits
poetically
called
vallies
we
retire
from
all
moonly
cares
or
range
through
the
meads
of
cysatus
or
gruemberget
and
luxuriate
in
the
coolness
of
the
conical
penumbra
i
trust
you
will
feel
dear
reader
that
you
now
owe
more
to
my
discoveries
than
to
those
of
endymion
copernicus
tycho
brahe
galileus
and
newton
i
pray
you
therefore
to
reward
my
services
with
a
long
and
happy
life
though
much
i
fear
i
shall
not
obtain
it
for
i
am
told
that
two
little
shining
specks
called
england
and
ireland
which
we
can
just
see
with
our
glasses
on
your
globe
are
the
places
that
i
must
depend
upon
for
my
health
and
prosperity
now
if
they
fall
i
must
fall
with
them
and
i
fancy
they
have
seen
the
best
of
their
days
already
a
parrot
informs
me
that
they
are
at
daggers
drawn
with
a
prodigious
blotch
just
beside
them
and
that
their
most
approved
patriots
daily
indite
pamphlets
to
shew
how
they
can
not
hold
out
ten
years
longer
the
sternian
starling
assured
me
just
now
that
these
patriots
write
the
triumphs
of
their
country
in
the
most
commiserating
language
and
portray
her
distresses
with
exultation
of
course
therefore
they
conceive
that
her
glories
would
undo
her
and
that
nothing
can
save
her
but
her
calamities
so
since
she
is
conquering
away
at
a
great
rate
i
may
fairly
infer
that
she
is
on
her
last
legs
before
i
conclude
i
must
inform
you
of
how
i
shall
have
this
letter
conveyed
to
your
world
laplace
and
other
philosophers
have
already
proved
that
a
stone
projected
by
a
volcano
from
the
moon
and
with
the
velocity
of
a
mile
and
a
half
per
second
would
be
thrown
beyond
the
sphere
of
the
moon
attraction
and
enter
into
the
confines
of
the
earth
now
hundreds
have
attested
on
oath
that
they
have
seen
luminous
meteors
moving
through
the
sky
and
that
these
have
fallen
on
the
earth
in
stony
or
masses
therefore
say
the
philosophers
these
masses
came
all
the
way
from
the
moon
and
they
say
perfectly
right
believe
it
piously
dear
reader
and
quote
me
as
your
authority
it
is
by
means
of
one
of
these
stones
that
i
shall
contrive
to
send
you
this
letter
i
have
written
it
on
asbestus
in
liquid
gold
as
both
these
substances
are
inconsumable
by
fire
and
i
will
fasten
it
to
the
top
of
a
volcanic
mountain
which
is
expected
to
explode
in
another
hour
alas
alas
mortals
how
little
ye
foresee
the
havoc
that
will
happen
hereafter
from
the
pelting
of
these
pitiless
stones
for
about
the
time
of
the
millenium
the
doctrine
of
projectiles
will
be
so
prodigiously
improved
that
while
there
is
universal
peace
upon
earth
the
planets
will
go
to
war
with
each
other
then
shall
we
lunarians
like
true
satellites
turn
upon
our
benefactors
and
instead
of
merely
trying
our
small
shot
as
at
present
we
will
fire
off
whole
mountains
while
you
from
your
superior
attraction
will
find
it
difficult
to
hit
us
at
all
the
consequence
must
be
our
losing
so
much
weight
that
we
shall
approach
by
degrees
nearer
and
nearer
to
you
at
last
both
globes
will
come
slap
together
flatten
each
other
out
like
the
pancakes
of
glasse
cookery
and
rush
headlong
into
primeval
chaos
such
will
be
the
consummation
of
all
things
adieu
the
heroine
letter
i
my
venerable
governess
guardian
of
my
youth
must
i
then
behold
you
no
more
no
more
at
breakfast
find
your
melancholy
features
shrouded
in
an
umbrageous
cap
a
novel
in
one
hand
a
cup
in
the
other
and
tears
springing
from
your
eyes
at
the
tale
too
tender
or
at
the
tea
too
hot
must
i
no
longer
wander
with
you
through
painted
meadows
and
by
purling
rivulets
motherless
am
i
to
be
bereft
of
my
more
than
mother
at
the
sensitive
age
of
fifteen
what
though
papa
caught
the
butler
kissing
you
in
the
pantry
what
though
he
turned
you
by
the
shoulder
out
of
his
house
i
am
persuaded
that
the
kiss
was
maternal
not
amorous
and
that
the
interesting
butler
is
your
son
perhaps
you
married
early
in
life
and
without
the
knowledge
of
your
parents
a
gipsy
stole
the
pretty
pledge
of
your
love
and
at
length
you
have
recognized
him
by
the
scar
on
his
cheek
happy
happy
mother
happy
too
perhaps
in
being
cast
upon
the
world
unprotected
and
defamed
while
i
am
doomed
to
endure
the
security
of
a
home
and
the
dullness
of
an
unimpeached
reputation
for
me
there
is
no
hope
whatever
of
being
reduced
to
despair
i
am
condemned
to
waste
my
health
bloom
and
youth
in
a
series
of
uninterrupted
prosperity
it
is
not
my
friend
that
i
wish
for
ultimate
unhappiness
but
that
i
am
anxious
to
suffer
present
sorrow
in
order
to
secure
future
felicity
an
improvement
you
will
own
on
the
system
of
other
girls
who
to
enjoy
the
passing
moment
run
the
risk
of
being
wretched
for
ever
after
have
not
all
persons
their
favorite
pursuits
in
life
and
do
not
all
brave
fatigue
vexation
and
calumny
for
the
purpose
of
accomplishing
them
one
woman
aspires
to
be
a
beauty
another
a
title
a
third
a
belle
esprit
and
to
effect
these
objects
health
is
sacrificed
reputation
tainted
and
peace
of
mind
destroyed
now
my
ambition
is
to
be
a
heroine
and
how
can
i
hope
to
succeed
in
my
vocation
unless
i
too
suffer
privations
and
inconveniences
besides
have
i
not
far
greater
merit
in
getting
a
husband
by
sentiment
adventure
and
melancholy
than
by
dressing
gadding
dancing
and
singing
for
heroines
are
just
as
much
on
the
alert
to
get
husbands
as
other
young
ladies
and
to
say
the
truth
i
would
never
voluntarily
subject
myself
to
misfortunes
were
i
not
certain
that
matrimony
would
be
the
last
of
them
but
even
misery
itself
has
its
consolations
and
advantages
it
makes
one
at
least
look
interesting
and
affords
an
opportunity
for
ornamental
murmurs
besides
it
is
the
mark
of
a
refined
mind
only
fools
children
and
savages
are
happy
with
these
sentiments
no
wonder
i
should
feel
discontented
at
my
present
mode
of
life
such
an
insipid
routine
always
always
always
the
same
rising
with
no
better
prospect
than
to
make
breakfast
for
papa
then
is
morrow
cherry
or
the
paper
come
cherry
or
cream
cherry
or
shall
we
have
to
dinner
cherry
at
dinner
nobody
but
a
farmer
or
the
parson
and
nothing
talked
but
politics
and
turnips
after
tea
i
am
made
sing
some
fal
lal
la
of
a
ditty
and
am
sent
to
bed
with
a
night
pretty
miss
or
dear
the
clowns
now
instead
of
this
just
conceive
me
a
child
of
misery
in
a
castle
a
convent
or
a
cottage
becoming
acquainted
with
the
hero
by
his
saving
my
life
i
in
beautiful
confusion
heaven
what
an
angel
cries
he
then
sudden
love
on
both
sides
in
two
days
he
kisses
my
hand
embarrassments
my
character
suspected
a
quarrel
a
reconciliation
fresh
o
biddy
what
an
irreparable
loss
to
the
public
that
a
victim
of
thrilling
sensibility
like
me
should
be
thus
idling
her
precious
time
over
the
common
occupations
of
life
prepared
as
i
am
too
by
a
five
years
course
of
novels
and
you
can
bear
witness
that
i
have
read
little
else
to
embody
and
ensoul
those
enchanting
reveries
which
i
am
accustomed
to
indulge
in
bed
and
bower
and
which
really
constitute
almost
the
whole
happiness
of
my
life
that
i
am
not
deficient
in
the
qualities
requisite
for
a
heroine
is
indisputable
all
the
world
says
i
am
handsome
and
it
would
be
melancholy
were
all
the
world
in
error
my
form
is
tall
and
aërial
my
face
grecian
my
tresses
flaxen
my
eyes
blue
and
sleepy
but
the
great
point
is
that
i
have
a
remarkable
mole
just
over
my
left
temple
then
not
only
peaches
roses
and
aurora
but
snow
lilies
and
alabaster
may
with
perfect
propriety
be
adopted
in
a
description
of
my
skin
i
confess
i
differ
from
other
heroines
in
one
point
they
you
may
remark
are
always
unconscious
of
their
charms
whereas
i
am
i
fear
convinced
of
mine
beyond
all
hope
of
retraction
there
is
but
one
serious
flaw
in
my
title
to
heroine
the
mediocrity
of
my
lineage
my
father
is
descended
from
nothing
better
than
a
decent
and
respectable
family
he
began
life
with
a
thousand
pounds
purchased
a
farm
and
by
his
honest
and
disgusting
industry
has
realized
fifty
thousand
were
even
my
legitimacy
suspected
it
would
be
some
comfort
since
in
that
case
i
should
assuredly
start
forth
at
one
time
or
other
the
daughter
of
some
plaintive
nobleman
who
lives
retired
and
slaps
his
forehead
one
more
subject
perplexes
me
it
is
my
name
and
what
a
name
cherry
it
reminds
one
so
much
of
plumpness
and
ruddy
health
cherry
better
be
called
at
once
there
is
a
green
and
yellow
melancholy
in
that
is
infinitely
preferable
i
wonder
whether
cherry
could
possibly
be
an
abbreviation
of
cherubina
is
only
changing
y
into
ubina
and
the
name
becomes
quite
classic
celestina
angelina
seraphina
are
all
of
the
same
family
but
cherubina
sounds
so
empyrean
so
something
or
other
beyond
mortality
and
besides
i
have
just
a
face
for
it
yes
cherubina
i
am
resolved
to
be
called
now
and
for
ever
but
you
must
naturally
wish
to
learn
what
has
happened
here
since
your
departure
i
was
in
my
boudoir
reading
the
delicate
distress
when
i
heard
a
sudden
bustle
below
and
of
the
house
this
moment
vociferated
by
my
father
the
next
minute
he
was
in
my
room
with
a
face
like
fire
cried
he
knew
what
your
famous
romances
would
do
for
us
at
last
sir
what
asked
i
with
the
calm
dignity
of
injured
innocence
a
kissing
match
between
the
governess
and
the
butler
answered
he
caught
them
at
the
sport
in
the
pantry
i
was
petrified
sir
said
i
must
surely
mistake
such
thing
cried
he
kiss
was
too
much
of
a
smacker
for
that
it
rang
through
the
pantry
but
please
the
fates
she
shall
never
darken
my
doors
again
i
have
just
discharged
both
herself
and
her
swain
and
what
is
better
i
have
ordered
all
the
novels
in
the
house
to
be
burnt
by
way
of
purification
as
they
love
to
talk
of
flames
i
suppose
they
will
like
to
feel
them
he
spoke
and
ran
raging
out
of
the
room
adieu
then
ye
dear
romances
adieu
for
ever
no
more
shall
i
sympathize
with
your
heroines
while
they
faint
and
blush
and
weep
through
four
octavos
adieu
ye
edwins
edgars
and
edmunds
ye
selinas
evelinas
malvinas
ye
inas
all
adieu
the
flames
will
consume
you
all
the
melody
of
emily
the
prattle
of
annette
and
the
hoarseness
of
ugo
all
will
be
confounded
in
one
indiscriminate
crackle
the
casa
and
castello
will
blaze
with
equal
fury
nor
will
the
virtue
of
pamela
aught
avail
to
save
nor
wolmar
delighting
to
see
his
wife
in
a
swoon
nor
werter
shelling
peas
and
reading
homer
nor
charlotte
cutting
bread
and
butter
for
the
children
you
too
my
loved
governess
i
regret
extremely
adieu
cherubina
letter
ii
it
was
not
till
this
morning
that
a
thought
of
the
most
interesting
nature
flashed
across
my
mind
pondering
on
the
cruel
conduct
of
my
reputed
father
in
having
burnt
my
novels
and
discharged
you
without
even
allowing
us
to
take
a
hysterical
farewell
i
was
struck
with
the
sudden
notion
that
the
man
is
not
my
father
at
all
in
short
i
began
with
wishing
this
the
case
and
have
ended
with
believing
it
my
reasons
are
irresistible
and
deduced
from
strong
and
stubborn
facts
for
first
there
is
no
likeness
between
this
wilkinson
and
me
is
true
he
has
blue
eyes
like
myself
but
has
he
my
pouting
lip
and
dimple
he
has
the
flaxen
hair
but
can
he
execute
the
rosy
smile
next
is
it
possible
that
i
who
was
born
a
heroine
and
who
must
therefore
have
sprung
from
an
idle
and
illustrious
family
should
be
the
daughter
of
a
farmer
a
thrifty
substantial
honest
farmer
the
thing
is
absurd
on
the
face
of
it
and
never
will
i
tamely
submit
to
such
an
indignity
full
of
this
idea
i
dressed
myself
in
haste
resolving
to
question
wilkinson
to
pierce
into
his
inmost
soul
to
speak
daggers
to
him
and
if
he
should
not
unfold
the
mystery
of
my
birth
to
fly
from
his
house
for
ever
with
a
palpitating
heart
i
descended
the
stairs
rushed
into
the
and
in
a
moment
was
at
the
feet
of
my
persecutor
my
hands
were
folded
across
my
bosom
and
my
blue
eyes
raised
to
his
face
cherry
said
he
laughing
is
a
new
flourish
there
child
now
fancy
yourself
stabbed
and
come
to
breakfast
me
cried
i
said
he
keep
your
countenance
as
stiff
and
steady
as
the
face
on
our
rapper
countenance
cried
i
worth
keeping
when
the
features
are
a
proof
of
the
descent
and
vindicate
the
noble
birth
from
the
baseness
of
the
adoption
come
said
he
cup
is
full
all
this
time
so
is
my
heart
cried
i
pressing
it
expressively
is
the
meaning
of
this
mummery
said
he
me
wilkinson
cried
i
rising
with
dignified
tranquillity
is
at
once
the
most
amiable
and
the
most
difficult
of
virtues
and
there
is
more
magnanimity
in
confessing
an
error
than
in
never
committing
one
your
written
sentences
cried
he
you
come
to
the
point
sir
said
i
be
plain
and
explicit
learn
that
i
have
discovered
a
mystery
in
my
birth
and
that
you
you
wilkinson
are
not
my
real
father
i
pronounced
these
words
with
a
measured
emphasis
and
one
of
my
ineffable
looks
wilkinson
coloured
like
scarlet
and
stared
steadily
in
my
face
you
scandalize
the
mother
that
bore
you
cried
he
fiercely
wilkinson
answered
i
you
would
by
calling
yourself
my
father
if
i
am
not
said
he
the
mischief
must
be
illustrious
heiress
cried
i
from
my
parents
in
her
infancy
snatched
by
thee
vile
agent
of
the
diabolical
conspiracy
he
looked
aghast
me
then
continued
i
man
tell
me
where
my
dear
my
distracted
father
lingers
out
the
remnant
of
his
wretched
days
my
mother
too
or
say
am
i
indeed
an
orphan
still
he
remained
mute
and
gazed
on
me
with
a
searching
intensity
i
raised
my
voice
thy
dire
offences
restore
an
outcast
to
her
birthright
make
atonement
or
at
i
thought
the
farmer
would
have
sunk
into
the
ground
continued
i
lowering
my
voice
not
i
thirst
for
vengeance
i
myself
will
intercede
for
thee
and
stay
the
sword
of
justice
poor
wretch
i
want
not
thy
blood
the
culprit
had
now
reached
the
climax
of
agony
and
writhed
through
every
limb
and
feature
cried
i
nothing
move
thee
to
confess
thy
crimes
then
hear
me
ere
aurora
with
rosy
fingers
shall
unbar
the
eastern
gate
child
my
child
my
dear
darling
daughter
exclaimed
this
accomplished
crocodile
bursting
into
tears
and
snatching
me
to
his
bosom
have
they
done
to
you
what
phantom
what
horrid
disorder
is
distracting
my
treasure
me
guileful
adulator
cried
i
try
thy
powers
of
tragedy
elsewhere
for
know
thee
i
spoke
and
extricated
myself
from
his
embrace
dreadful
muttered
he
sweet
senses
are
lost
then
turning
to
me
love
my
life
do
not
speak
thus
to
your
poor
old
father
exclaimed
i
accomplishing
with
much
accuracy
that
hysterical
laugh
which
gratefully
let
me
own
i
owe
to
your
instruction
the
fat
farmer
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
rushed
out
of
the
room
i
relate
the
several
conversations
in
a
dramatic
manner
and
word
for
word
as
well
as
i
can
recollect
them
since
i
remark
that
all
heroines
do
the
same
indeed
i
can
not
enough
admire
the
fortitude
of
these
charming
creatures
who
while
they
are
in
momentary
expectation
of
losing
their
lives
or
their
honours
or
both
sit
down
with
the
utmost
unconcern
and
indite
the
wittiest
letters
in
the
world
they
have
even
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
copy
the
vulgar
dialect
uncooth
phraseology
and
bad
grammar
of
the
villains
whom
they
dread
and
all
this
in
the
neatest
and
liveliest
style
imaginable
adieu
letter
iii
soon
after
my
last
letter
i
was
summoned
to
dinner
what
heroine
in
distress
but
loaths
her
food
so
i
sent
a
message
that
i
was
unwell
and
then
solaced
myself
with
a
volume
of
the
mysteries
of
udolpho
which
had
escaped
the
conflagration
at
ten
i
flung
myself
on
my
bed
in
hopes
to
have
dreams
portentous
of
my
future
fate
for
heroines
are
remarkably
subject
to
a
certain
prophetic
sort
of
you
remember
the
story
that
ludovico
read
of
a
spectre
who
beckons
a
baron
from
his
castle
in
the
dead
of
night
and
leading
him
into
a
forest
points
to
his
own
corpse
and
bids
him
bury
it
well
owing
i
suppose
to
my
having
just
read
this
episode
and
to
my
having
fasted
so
long
i
had
the
following
dreams
methought
a
delicious
odour
of
viands
attracted
me
to
the
kitchen
where
i
found
an
iron
pot
upon
the
fire
simmering
in
unison
with
my
sighs
as
i
looked
at
it
with
a
longing
eye
the
lid
began
to
rise
and
i
beheld
a
turkey
stalk
majestically
forth
it
beckoned
me
with
its
claw
i
followed
it
led
me
into
the
yard
and
pointed
to
its
own
head
and
feathers
which
were
lying
in
a
corner
i
felt
infinitely
affected
straight
the
scene
changed
i
found
myself
seated
at
a
and
while
i
was
expecting
the
repast
lo
the
genius
of
dinner
appeared
he
had
a
mantle
laced
with
silver
eels
and
his
locks
were
dropping
with
costly
soups
a
crown
of
golden
fishes
was
on
his
head
and
pheasants
wings
at
his
shoulders
a
flight
of
little
tartlets
fluttered
around
him
and
the
sky
rained
down
hock
comfits
and
tokay
as
i
gazed
on
him
he
vanished
in
a
sigh
that
was
strongly
impregnated
with
the
fumes
of
brandy
what
vulgar
what
disgusting
visions
when
i
ought
to
have
dreamt
of
nothing
but
coffins
and
ladies
in
black
at
breakfast
this
morning
wilkinson
affected
the
most
tender
solicitude
for
my
health
and
as
i
now
watched
his
words
i
could
discover
in
almost
all
that
he
said
something
to
confirm
my
surmise
of
his
not
being
my
father
after
breakfast
a
letter
was
handed
to
him
which
he
read
and
then
gave
to
me
it
was
as
follows
london
in
accepting
your
invitation
to
sylvan
lodge
my
respected
friend
i
am
sure
i
shall
confer
a
far
greater
favor
on
myself
than
as
you
kindly
tell
me
i
shall
on
you
after
an
absence
of
seven
years
spent
in
the
seclusion
of
a
college
and
the
fatigues
of
a
military
life
how
delightful
to
revisit
the
scene
of
my
childhood
and
those
who
contribute
to
render
its
memory
so
dear
i
left
you
while
you
were
my
guardian
i
return
to
you
with
the
assurances
of
finding
you
a
friend
let
me
but
find
you
what
i
left
you
and
you
shall
take
what
title
you
please
yet
much
as
i
flatter
myself
with
your
retaining
all
your
former
feelings
towards
me
i
must
expect
a
serious
alteration
in
those
of
my
friend
cherry
will
she
again
make
me
her
playmate
again
climb
my
shoulders
and
gallop
me
round
the
lawn
are
we
to
renew
all
our
little
quarrels
then
kiss
and
be
friends
shall
we
even
recognize
each
other
features
through
their
change
from
childhood
to
maturity
there
is
at
least
one
feature
of
our
early
days
that
i
trust
has
undergone
no
alteration
our
mutual
affection
and
friendship
i
fear
i
can
not
manage
matters
so
as
to
be
with
you
before
ten
night
remember
i
bespeak
my
old
room
ever
affectionately
your
robert
stuart
to
gregory
wilkinson
esq
cries
the
farmer
i
have
deprived
you
of
an
old
woman
i
have
got
you
a
young
man
large
estates
you
know
handsome
fashionable
come
pluck
up
a
heart
my
girl
ay
egad
and
steal
one
too
i
rose
gave
him
one
of
my
ineffable
looks
and
retired
to
my
chamber
said
i
locking
my
door
and
flinging
myself
on
the
bed
is
something
like
misery
here
is
a
precious
project
against
my
peace
i
am
to
be
forced
into
marriage
am
i
and
with
whom
a
man
whose
legitimacy
is
unimpeached
and
whose
friends
would
certainly
consent
his
name
robert
too
master
bobby
as
the
servants
used
to
call
him
a
fellow
that
mewed
like
a
cat
when
he
was
whipt
o
my
bob
what
a
pretty
monosyllable
for
a
girl
like
me
to
pronounce
now
indeed
my
wretchedness
is
complete
the
cup
is
full
even
to
overflowing
an
orphan
or
at
least
an
outcast
immured
in
the
prison
of
a
proud
oppressor
threatened
with
a
husband
of
decent
birth
parentage
and
education
my
governess
gone
my
novels
burnt
what
is
left
to
me
but
flight
yes
i
will
roam
through
the
wide
world
in
search
of
my
parents
i
will
ransack
all
the
sliding
pannels
and
tapestries
in
italy
i
will
explore
il
castello
di
udolpho
and
will
then
enter
the
convent
of
ursulines
or
carmelites
or
santa
della
pieta
or
the
abbey
of
la
trappe
here
i
meet
with
nothing
better
than
smiling
faces
and
honest
hearts
or
at
best
with
but
sneaking
villains
no
precious
scoundrels
are
here
no
horrors
or
atrocities
worth
mentioning
but
abroad
i
shall
encounter
banditti
monks
daggers
racks
o
ye
celebrated
terrors
when
shall
i
taste
of
you
i
then
lay
planning
an
elopement
till
i
was
called
to
dinner
adieu
letter
iv
o
my
friend
such
a
discovery
a
parchment
and
a
picture
but
you
shall
hear
after
dinner
i
stole
into
wilkinson
study
in
hopes
of
finding
before
my
flight
some
record
or
relic
that
might
aid
me
in
unravelling
the
mystery
of
my
birth
as
heroines
are
privileged
to
ransack
private
drawers
and
read
whatever
they
find
there
i
opened
wilkinson
scrutoire
without
ceremony
but
what
were
my
sensations
when
i
discovered
in
a
corner
of
it
an
antique
piece
of
tattered
parchment
scrawled
all
over
in
uncouth
characters
with
this
frightful
fragment
for
and
in
consideration
of
doth
grant
bargain
release
possession
and
to
his
heirs
and
assigns
lands
of
sylvan
lodge
in
the
trees
stones
quarries
reasonable
amends
and
satisfaction
this
demise
molestation
of
him
the
said
gregory
wilkinson
the
natural
life
of
cherry
wilkinson
only
daughter
of
de
willoughby
eldest
son
of
thomas
lady
gwyn
of
gwyn
castle
o
biddy
does
not
your
blood
run
cold
at
this
horrible
scrawl
for
already
you
must
have
decyphered
its
terrific
import
the
part
lost
may
be
guessed
from
the
part
left
in
short
it
is
a
written
covenant
between
this
gregory
wilkinson
and
the
miscreant
whom
my
being
an
heiress
had
prevented
from
enjoying
the
title
and
estate
that
would
devolve
to
him
at
my
death
stipulating
to
give
wilkinson
lodge
together
with
stones
quarries
as
amends
and
satisfaction
for
being
the
instrument
of
my
and
declaring
that
there
shall
be
molestation
of
him
the
said
gregory
wilkinson
for
taking
away
natural
life
of
cherry
wilkinson
daughter
of
something
willoughby
eldest
son
of
thomas
what
an
unfortunate
chasm
then
follows
gwyn
of
gwyn
castle
so
that
it
is
evident
i
am
at
least
a
de
willoughby
and
if
not
noble
myself
related
to
nobility
for
what
confirms
me
in
this
supposition
of
my
relationship
to
lady
gwyn
is
an
old
portrait
which
i
found
a
few
minutes
after
in
one
of
wilkinson
drawers
representing
a
young
and
beautiful
female
dressed
in
a
superb
style
and
underneath
it
in
large
letters
the
name
of
gwyn
distraction
what
shall
i
do
whither
turn
to
sleep
another
night
under
the
same
roof
with
a
wretch
who
has
bound
himself
to
assassinate
me
would
be
little
short
of
madness
my
plan
therefore
is
already
arranged
for
flight
and
this
very
evening
i
mean
to
begin
my
pilgrimage
the
picture
and
parchment
i
will
hide
in
my
bosom
during
my
journey
and
i
will
also
carry
with
me
a
small
bandbox
containing
my
satin
slip
a
pair
of
silk
stockings
my
spangled
muslin
and
all
my
jewels
for
as
some
benevolent
duchess
may
possibly
take
me
into
her
family
and
her
son
persecute
me
i
might
just
as
well
look
decent
you
know
on
mature
deliberation
i
have
resolved
to
take
but
five
guineas
with
me
since
more
would
make
me
too
comfortable
and
tempt
me
in
some
critical
moment
to
extricate
myself
from
distress
i
shall
leave
the
following
billet
on
my
toilet
to
gregory
wilkinson
farmer
sir
when
this
letter
meets
your
eye
the
wretched
writer
will
be
far
removed
from
your
machinations
she
will
be
wandering
the
convex
earth
in
pursuit
of
those
parents
from
whose
dear
embraces
you
have
torn
her
she
will
be
flying
from
a
stuart
for
whose
detestable
embraces
you
have
designed
her
your
motive
for
this
hopeful
match
i
can
guess
as
you
obtained
one
property
by
undertaking
my
death
you
are
probably
promised
another
for
effecting
my
marriage
learn
that
the
latter
fate
has
more
terrors
for
me
than
the
former
but
i
have
escaped
both
as
for
the
ten
thousand
pounds
willed
to
me
by
your
deceased
wife
i
suppose
it
will
revert
to
you
as
soon
as
i
prove
that
i
am
not
your
daughter
silly
man
you
might
at
this
moment
obtain
that
legacy
by
restoring
me
to
my
real
parents
alas
sir
you
are
indeed
very
wicked
yet
remember
that
repentance
is
never
too
late
and
that
virtue
alone
is
true
nobility
the
much
injured
cherubina
all
is
prepared
and
in
ten
minutes
i
commence
my
interesting
expedition
london
being
the
grand
emporium
of
adventure
and
the
most
likely
place
for
obtaining
information
on
the
subject
of
my
birth
i
mean
to
bend
my
steps
thither
and
as
stuart
is
to
be
here
at
ten
and
as
he
must
come
the
london
road
i
shall
probably
meet
him
should
i
recognize
him
what
a
scene
we
shall
have
but
he
can
not
possibly
recognize
me
since
i
was
only
eight
years
old
when
we
last
parted
adieu
letter
v
the
rain
rattled
and
the
wind
whistled
as
i
tied
on
my
bonnet
for
my
journey
with
the
bandbox
in
my
hand
i
descended
the
stairs
and
paused
in
the
hall
to
listen
i
heard
a
distant
door
shut
and
steps
advancing
not
a
moment
was
to
be
lost
so
i
sprang
forward
opened
the
hall
door
and
ran
down
the
shrubbery
peaceful
shades
exclaimed
i
must
i
leave
you
in
your
retreats
i
should
still
find
pleasure
and
repose
i
then
hastened
into
the
london
road
and
pressed
forward
with
a
hurried
step
while
a
violent
tempest
beat
full
against
my
face
being
in
such
distress
i
thought
it
incumbent
on
me
to
compose
a
sonnet
which
i
copy
for
you
sonnet
bereft
by
wretches
of
endearing
home
and
all
the
joys
of
parent
and
of
friend
unsheltered
midst
the
shattering
storm
i
roam
on
mangled
feet
and
soon
my
life
must
end
so
the
young
lark
whom
sire
and
mother
tend
some
fowler
robs
of
sire
and
mother
dear
all
day
dejected
in
its
nest
it
lies
no
food
no
song
no
sheltering
pinion
near
night
comes
instead
and
tempests
round
it
rise
at
morn
with
gasping
beak
and
upward
breast
it
dies
four
long
and
toilsome
miles
had
i
now
walked
with
a
dignified
air
till
finding
myself
fatigued
and
despairing
of
an
interview
with
stuart
i
resolved
to
rest
awhile
in
the
lone
and
uninhabited
house
which
lies
you
may
recollect
on
the
grey
common
about
a
hundred
paces
from
the
road
besides
i
was
in
duty
bound
to
explore
it
as
a
ruined
pile
i
approached
it
the
wind
moaned
through
the
broken
windows
and
the
rank
grass
rustled
in
the
court
i
entered
all
was
dark
within
the
boards
creaked
as
i
trod
the
shutters
flapped
and
an
ominous
owl
was
hooting
in
the
chimney
i
groped
my
way
along
the
hall
thence
into
a
parlour
up
stairs
and
down
not
a
horror
to
be
found
no
dead
hand
met
my
left
hand
firmly
grasping
it
and
drawing
me
forcibly
forward
no
huge
glared
at
me
through
a
crevice
how
disheartening
the
cold
was
now
creeping
through
me
my
teeth
chattered
and
my
whole
frame
shook
i
had
seated
myself
on
the
stairs
and
was
weeping
piteously
wishing
myself
safe
at
home
and
in
bed
and
deploring
the
dire
necessity
which
had
compelled
me
to
this
frightful
undertaking
when
on
a
sudden
i
heard
the
sound
of
approaching
steps
i
sprang
upon
my
feet
with
renovated
spirits
presently
several
persons
entered
the
hall
and
a
vulgar
accent
cried
run
down
to
the
cellar
and
strike
a
light
can
you
want
of
me
now
that
you
have
robbed
me
said
the
voice
of
a
gentleman
young
man
answered
a
ruffian
want
you
to
write
home
for
a
hundred
pounds
or
some
such
trifle
which
we
will
have
the
honour
of
spending
for
you
you
must
manufacture
some
confounded
good
lie
about
where
you
are
and
why
you
send
for
the
money
and
one
of
us
will
carry
the
letter
assure
you
said
the
youth
shall
forge
no
such
falsehood
you
please
master
replied
the
ruffian
the
money
or
your
life
we
must
have
and
that
soon
you
trust
my
solemn
promise
to
send
you
a
hundred
pounds
said
the
other
name
is
stuart
i
am
on
my
way
to
wilkinson
of
sylvan
lodge
so
you
may
depend
upon
my
sending
you
by
his
assistance
the
sum
that
you
require
and
i
will
promise
not
to
betray
you
curse
me
if
i
trust
cried
the
robber
curse
me
if
i
write
said
stuart
you
squire
cried
the
robber
can
not
stand
parlying
with
you
now
we
have
other
matters
on
hands
but
we
will
lock
you
safe
in
the
cellar
with
pen
ink
and
paper
and
a
lantern
and
if
you
have
not
a
fine
bouncing
lie
of
a
letter
ready
written
when
we
come
back
you
are
a
dead
man
that
is
all
am
almost
a
dead
man
already
said
stuart
the
cut
you
gave
me
is
bleeding
torrents
they
now
carried
him
down
to
the
cellar
and
remained
there
a
few
minutes
then
returned
and
locked
the
door
outside
the
key
in
it
says
one
we
do
not
know
which
of
us
may
come
back
first
they
then
went
away
now
was
the
fate
of
my
bitter
enemy
the
wily
the
wicked
stuart
in
my
power
i
could
either
liberate
him
or
leave
him
to
perish
it
struck
me
that
to
miss
such
a
promising
interview
would
be
stupid
in
the
extreme
and
i
felt
a
sort
of
glow
at
the
idea
of
saying
to
him
live
besides
the
fellow
had
answered
the
robbers
with
some
spirit
so
i
descended
the
steps
unlocked
the
door
and
bursting
into
the
cellar
stood
in
an
unparalleled
attitude
before
him
he
was
sitting
on
the
ground
and
fastening
a
handkerchief
about
his
wounded
leg
but
at
my
entrance
he
sprang
upon
his
feet
save
thyself
cried
i
who
restores
thee
to
freedom
flies
herself
from
captivity
look
on
these
features
thou
wouldest
have
wrung
them
with
despair
look
on
this
form
thou
wouldest
have
prest
it
in
depravity
hence
unhappy
sinner
and
learn
that
innocence
is
ever
victorious
and
ever
merciful
am
all
amazement
exclaimed
he
are
you
whence
come
you
why
speak
so
angrily
yet
act
so
kindly
i
smiled
disdain
and
turned
to
depart
moment
more
cried
he
is
some
mistake
for
i
never
even
saw
you
before
exclaimed
i
and
was
again
going
you
will
leave
me
my
sweet
girl
said
he
smiling
you
have
all
this
time
prevented
me
from
binding
my
wound
and
you
owe
me
some
compensation
for
loss
of
blood
i
paused
would
ask
you
to
assist
me
continued
he
in
binding
one
wound
i
fear
you
would
inflict
another
mere
curiosity
made
me
return
two
steps
think
however
there
would
be
healing
in
the
touch
of
so
fair
a
hand
and
he
took
mine
as
he
spoke
at
this
moment
my
humanity
conquered
my
reserve
and
kneeling
down
i
began
to
fasten
the
bandage
but
resolved
on
not
uttering
another
word
kindness
cried
he
pray
to
whom
am
i
indebted
for
it
no
reply
least
may
i
learn
whether
i
can
in
any
manner
repay
it
no
reply
said
i
think
that
you
had
just
escaped
from
confinement
no
reply
will
stain
your
beautiful
locks
said
he
blood
should
flow
to
defend
but
shall
not
flow
to
disfigure
them
permit
me
to
collect
those
charming
tresses
dear
thank
you
sir
stammered
i
thank
you
ten
thousand
times
said
he
as
i
finished
my
disagreeable
task
now
never
will
i
quit
you
till
i
see
you
safe
to
your
friends
exclaimed
i
traitor
he
gazed
at
me
with
a
look
of
pity
then
my
kind
preserver
said
he
a
long
way
to
the
next
habitation
and
should
my
wound
open
afresh
and
should
i
faint
from
loss
of
blood
me
said
i
me
assist
you
he
smiled
will
assist
each
other
answered
he
now
let
us
not
lose
a
moment
for
the
robbers
may
return
he
took
the
lantern
to
search
the
cellar
for
his
watch
and
money
however
we
saw
nothing
there
but
a
couple
of
portmanteaus
some
rusty
pistols
and
a
small
barrel
half
full
of
gunpowder
we
then
left
the
house
but
had
hardly
proceeded
twenty
yards
when
he
began
to
totter
can
go
no
farther
said
he
sinking
down
have
lost
so
much
blood
that
my
strength
is
entirely
exhausted
sir
said
i
yourself
and
lean
on
me
answered
he
fly
and
save
your
own
life
will
run
for
assistance
said
i
and
flew
towards
the
road
where
i
had
just
heard
the
sound
of
an
approaching
carriage
but
on
a
sudden
it
stopped
voices
began
disputing
and
soon
after
a
pistol
was
fired
i
paused
in
great
terror
for
i
judged
that
these
were
the
robbers
again
what
was
i
to
do
when
a
heroine
is
reduced
to
extremities
she
always
does
one
of
two
things
either
faints
on
the
spot
or
exhibits
energies
almost
superhuman
faint
i
could
not
so
nothing
remained
for
me
but
energies
almost
superhuman
i
pondered
a
moment
and
a
grand
thought
struck
me
recollecting
the
gunpowder
in
the
cellar
i
flew
for
it
back
to
the
ruin
carried
it
up
to
the
hall
threw
most
of
it
on
the
floor
and
with
the
remainder
strewed
a
train
as
i
walked
towards
stuart
when
i
was
within
a
few
paces
of
him
i
heard
quick
steps
and
a
hoarse
voice
vociferating
goes
yonder
with
the
light
for
i
had
brought
the
lantern
with
me
cried
stuart
you
are
lost
i
snatched
the
candle
from
the
lantern
applied
it
to
the
train
and
the
next
moment
dropped
to
the
ground
at
the
shock
of
the
tremendous
explosion
that
followed
a
noise
of
falling
timbers
resounded
through
the
ruin
and
the
robbers
were
heard
scampering
off
in
all
directions
whispered
i
after
a
pause
is
an
original
horror
for
you
and
all
of
my
own
contrivance
the
villains
have
fled
the
neighbours
will
flock
to
the
spot
and
you
will
obtain
assistance
by
this
time
we
heard
the
people
of
the
carriage
running
towards
us
cried
i
in
an
awful
voice
name
indeed
said
he
is
completely
inexplicable
cried
i
my
parting
words
quoting
his
own
letter
i
make
you
my
playmate
never
again
climb
your
shoulders
and
gallop
you
round
the
lawn
ten
is
past
go
not
to
sylvan
lodge
she
departed
two
hours
ago
look
to
your
steps
i
spoke
this
portentous
warning
and
fled
across
the
common
miss
wilkinson
miss
wilkinson
sounded
on
the
blast
but
the
wretch
had
discovered
me
too
late
i
ran
about
half
a
mile
and
then
looking
behind
me
beheld
the
ruin
in
a
blaze
renovated
by
the
sight
of
this
horror
i
walked
another
hour
without
once
stopping
till
to
my
surprise
and
dismay
i
found
myself
utterly
unable
to
proceed
a
step
farther
this
was
the
more
provoking
because
heroines
often
perform
journies
on
foot
that
would
founder
fifty
horses
i
now
knocked
at
a
on
the
side
of
the
road
but
the
people
would
not
admit
me
soon
after
i
perceived
a
boy
watching
sheep
in
a
field
and
begged
earnestly
that
he
would
direct
me
to
some
romantic
cottage
shaded
with
vines
and
acacias
and
inhabited
by
a
lovely
little
arcadian
family
is
no
family
of
that
name
in
these
here
parts
said
he
here
cried
i
my
friend
that
is
not
pastoral
language
i
see
you
will
never
pipe
madrigals
to
a
chloris
or
a
daphne
what
sort
of
nasty
language
is
that
cried
he
along
with
you
do
i
warrant
you
are
a
bad
one
and
he
began
pelting
me
with
tufts
of
grass
at
last
i
contrived
to
shelter
myself
under
a
haycock
where
i
remained
till
day
began
to
dawn
then
stiff
and
chilled
i
proceeded
on
my
journey
and
in
a
short
time
met
a
little
girl
with
a
pail
of
milk
who
consented
to
let
me
change
my
dress
at
her
cottage
and
conducted
me
thither
it
was
a
family
of
frights
flat
noses
and
thick
lips
without
mercy
no
annettes
and
lubins
or
amorets
and
phyllidas
or
florimels
and
florellas
no
little
cherubin
and
seraphim
amongst
them
however
i
slipped
on
for
is
the
heroic
mode
of
dressing
my
spangled
muslin
and
joined
their
uglinesses
at
breakfast
resolving
to
bear
patiently
with
their
features
they
tell
me
that
a
public
coach
to
london
will
shortly
pass
this
way
so
i
shall
take
a
place
in
it
on
the
whole
i
see
much
reason
to
be
pleased
with
what
has
happened
hitherto
how
fortunate
that
i
went
to
the
house
on
the
common
i
see
plainly
that
if
adventure
does
not
come
to
me
i
must
go
to
adventure
and
indeed
i
am
authorized
in
doing
so
by
the
example
of
my
sister
heroines
who
with
a
noble
disinterestedness
are
ever
the
chief
artificers
of
their
own
misfortunes
for
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
were
they
to
manage
matters
like
mere
common
mortals
they
would
avoid
all
those
charming
mischiefs
which
adorn
their
memoirs
as
for
this
stuart
i
know
not
what
to
think
of
him
i
will
however
do
him
the
justice
to
say
that
he
has
a
pleasing
countenance
and
although
he
neither
kissed
my
hand
nor
knelt
to
me
yet
he
had
the
decency
to
talk
of
and
my
tresses
perhaps
if
he
had
saved
my
life
instead
of
my
having
saved
his
and
if
his
name
had
consisted
of
three
syllables
ending
in
i
or
o
and
in
fine
were
he
not
an
unprincipled
profligate
the
man
might
have
made
a
tolerable
hero
at
all
events
i
heartily
hate
him
and
his
smooth
words
went
for
nothing
the
coach
is
in
sight
adieu
letter
vi
shall
find
in
the
coach
said
i
approaching
it
emaciated
adelaide
or
sister
olivia
we
will
interchange
congenial
looks
she
will
sigh
so
will
i
and
we
shall
commence
a
vigorous
friendship
on
the
spot
yes
i
did
sigh
but
it
was
at
the
huge
and
hideous
adelaide
that
presented
herself
as
i
got
into
the
coach
in
describing
her
our
wittiest
novelists
would
say
that
her
nose
lay
modestly
retired
between
her
cheeks
that
her
eyes
which
pointed
inwards
seemed
looking
for
it
and
that
her
teeth
were
angels
visits
short
and
far
between
she
first
eyed
me
with
a
supercilious
sneer
and
then
addressed
a
diminutive
old
gentleman
opposite
in
whose
face
time
had
ploughed
furrows
and
luxury
sown
pimples
so
sir
as
i
was
telling
you
when
my
poor
man
died
i
so
bemoaned
myself
that
between
swoons
and
hysterics
i
got
nervous
all
over
and
was
obliged
to
go
through
a
regiment
i
stared
in
astonishment
thought
i
woman
of
her
magnitude
and
vulgarity
faint
and
have
nerves
impossible
continued
she
bible
and
my
daughter
moll
are
great
consolations
to
me
moll
is
the
dearest
little
thing
in
the
world
as
straight
as
a
popular
then
such
dimples
and
her
eyes
are
the
very
squintessence
of
perfection
she
has
all
her
catechism
by
heart
and
moreover
her
mind
is
uncontaminated
by
romances
and
novels
and
such
abominations
said
i
civilly
i
presume
to
ask
how
romances
and
novels
contaminate
the
mind
mem
answered
she
tartly
and
after
another
survey
teaching
little
misses
to
go
gadding
mem
and
to
be
fond
of
the
men
mem
and
of
spangled
muslin
mem
said
i
reddening
wear
spangled
muslin
because
i
have
no
other
dress
and
you
should
be
ashamed
of
yourself
for
saying
that
i
am
fond
of
the
men
cap
fits
you
then
cried
she
it
a
fool
cap
said
i
i
might
return
the
compliment
i
thought
it
expedient
at
my
first
outset
in
life
to
practise
apt
repartee
and
emulate
the
infatuating
sauciness
and
elegant
vituperation
of
amanda
the
beggar
girl
and
other
heroines
who
when
irritated
disdain
to
speak
below
an
epigram
sir
said
she
to
our
fellow
traveller
is
your
opinion
of
novels
ant
they
all
love
and
nonsense
and
the
most
unpossible
lies
possible
are
fictions
certainly
said
he
sir
exclaimed
i
do
not
mean
to
call
them
fictions
no
replied
he
absolute
fictions
cried
the
big
lady
do
pretend
to
call
them
true
no
said
he
absolutely
true
cried
i
are
on
both
sides
of
the
question
at
once
he
trod
on
my
foot
that
you
are
said
the
big
lady
he
trod
on
her
foot
am
too
much
of
a
courtier
said
he
differ
from
the
ladies
and
he
trod
on
both
our
feet
courtier
cried
i
should
rather
have
imagined
you
a
musician
why
said
he
answered
i
are
playing
the
pedal
harp
on
this
foot
and
mine
wished
to
produce
harmony
said
he
with
a
submitting
bow
least
said
i
must
be
much
more
true
than
histories
because
historians
often
contradict
each
other
but
novelists
never
do
do
not
novelists
contradict
themselves
said
he
replied
i
there
lies
the
surest
proof
of
their
veracity
for
as
human
actions
are
always
contradicting
themselves
so
those
books
which
faithfully
relate
them
must
do
the
same
exclaimed
he
yet
what
proof
have
we
that
such
personages
as
schedoni
vivaldi
camilla
or
cecilia
ever
existed
what
proof
have
we
cried
i
such
personages
as
alfred
the
great
henry
the
fifth
elfrida
or
mary
queen
of
scots
ever
existed
i
wonder
at
a
man
of
sense
like
you
why
sir
at
this
rate
you
might
just
as
well
question
the
truth
of
guy
faux
attempt
to
blow
up
the
or
of
my
having
blown
up
a
house
last
night
blow
up
a
house
exclaimed
the
big
lady
with
amazement
said
i
modestly
scorn
ostentation
but
on
my
word
and
honour
is
fact
course
you
did
it
accidentally
said
the
gentleman
wrong
me
sir
replied
i
did
it
by
design
will
swing
for
it
however
cried
the
big
lady
for
it
said
i
heroine
swing
excellent
i
presume
madam
you
are
unacquainted
with
the
common
law
of
romance
said
she
you
seem
to
be
with
the
common
law
of
england
despise
the
common
law
of
england
cried
i
i
fancy
said
she
would
not
be
much
amiss
if
you
were
hanged
i
fancy
retorted
i
nodding
at
her
big
figure
would
not
be
much
amiss
if
you
were
quartered
instantly
she
took
out
a
and
began
muttering
over
it
with
the
most
violent
piety
and
indignation
meantime
the
gentleman
coincided
in
every
syllable
that
i
said
praised
my
parts
and
knowledge
and
discovered
evident
symptoms
of
a
discriminating
mind
and
an
amiable
heart
that
i
am
right
in
my
good
opinion
of
him
is
most
certain
for
he
himself
assured
me
that
it
would
be
quite
impossible
to
deceive
me
i
am
so
penetrating
in
short
i
have
set
him
down
as
the
benevolent
guardian
whom
my
memoirs
will
hereafter
celebrate
for
having
saved
me
from
destruction
indeed
he
has
already
done
so
for
when
our
journey
was
almost
over
he
told
me
that
my
having
set
fire
to
the
ruin
might
prove
a
most
fatal
affair
and
whispered
that
the
big
lady
would
probably
inform
against
me
on
my
pleading
the
prescriptive
immunities
of
heroines
and
asserting
that
the
law
could
never
lay
its
fangs
on
so
ethereal
a
name
as
cherubina
he
solemnly
swore
to
me
that
he
once
knew
a
heroine
called
angelica
angela
angelina
who
was
hanged
at
the
old
bailey
for
stealing
a
broken
lute
out
of
a
haunted
chamber
and
while
my
blood
was
running
cold
at
the
recital
he
pressed
me
so
cordially
to
take
refuge
in
his
house
that
at
length
i
threw
myself
on
the
protection
of
the
best
of
men
i
now
write
from
his
mansion
in
grosvenor
square
where
we
have
just
dined
his
name
is
betterton
he
has
no
family
and
is
possessed
of
a
splendid
independence
multitudes
of
liveried
menials
watch
his
nod
and
he
does
me
the
honour
to
call
me
cousin
my
chamber
too
is
charming
the
curtains
hang
quite
in
a
new
style
but
i
do
not
like
the
pattern
of
the
drapery
i
mean
to
go
shopping
and
i
may
at
the
same
time
pick
up
some
adventures
on
my
way
for
business
must
be
minded
adieu
letter
vii
soon
after
my
last
letter
i
was
summoned
to
supper
betterton
appeared
much
interested
in
my
destiny
and
i
took
good
care
to
inspire
him
with
a
due
sense
of
my
forlorn
and
unprotected
state
i
told
him
that
i
had
not
a
friend
in
the
wide
world
related
to
him
my
lamentable
tale
and
as
a
proof
of
my
veracity
shewed
him
the
parchment
the
picture
and
the
mole
to
my
great
surprise
he
said
that
he
considered
my
high
birth
improbable
and
then
began
advising
me
to
descend
from
my
romantic
flights
as
he
called
them
and
to
seek
after
happiness
instead
of
misery
this
town
continued
he
after
a
long
preamble
charms
would
be
despotic
if
unchained
by
legal
constraints
but
for
ever
distant
from
you
be
that
cold
and
languid
tie
which
erroneous
policy
invented
for
you
be
the
sacred
community
of
souls
the
mystic
union
whose
tie
of
bondage
is
the
sway
of
passion
the
wish
the
licence
and
impulse
the
law
expressions
enough
said
i
i
can
not
comprehend
them
girl
cried
he
while
he
conjured
up
a
fiend
of
a
smile
and
drew
a
brilliant
from
his
finger
this
ring
and
the
signature
of
the
hand
that
has
worn
it
securing
to
you
five
hundred
while
you
remain
under
my
protection
monster
exclaimed
i
is
this
thy
vile
design
so
saying
i
flung
the
ruffian
from
me
then
rushed
down
stairs
opened
the
door
and
quick
as
lightning
darted
along
the
streets
at
last
panting
for
breath
i
paused
underneath
a
portico
it
was
now
midnight
not
a
wheel
not
a
hoof
fatigued
the
pavement
or
disturbed
the
slumbering
mud
of
the
metropolis
but
soon
steps
and
soft
voices
broke
the
silence
and
a
youth
encircling
a
maiden
waist
with
his
arm
and
modulating
the
most
mellifluent
phraseology
passed
by
me
another
couple
succeeded
and
another
and
another
the
town
seemed
swarming
with
heroes
and
heroines
pairs
ejaculated
i
length
ye
enjoy
the
reward
of
your
incomparable
constancy
and
virtue
here
after
a
long
separation
meeting
by
chance
and
in
extreme
distress
ye
pour
forth
the
pure
effusions
of
your
souls
o
blissful
termination
of
unexampled
miseries
i
now
perceived
on
the
steps
of
a
house
a
fair
and
slender
form
robed
in
white
she
was
sitting
with
her
elbow
in
her
lap
and
her
head
leaning
on
one
side
within
her
hand
seems
a
sister
in
misfortune
said
i
should
she
but
have
a
madona
face
and
a
name
ending
in
a
we
will
live
we
will
die
together
i
then
approached
and
discovered
a
countenance
so
pale
so
pensive
so
roman
that
i
could
almost
have
knelt
and
worshipped
it
unfortunate
said
i
taking
her
hand
and
pressing
it
unknown
say
by
what
name
am
i
to
address
so
gentle
a
sister
in
misery
what
cried
she
in
a
tone
somewhat
coarser
than
i
was
prepared
to
expect
i
presume
on
my
sudden
predilection
said
i
inquire
your
name
replied
she
rising
from
her
seat
now
i
must
be
gone
where
are
you
going
maria
said
i
the
devil
said
she
my
love
whispered
i
hath
bewildered
thee
impart
to
me
the
cause
of
thy
distress
and
perhaps
i
can
alleviate
if
not
relieve
it
i
am
myself
a
miserable
orphan
but
happy
thrice
happy
could
i
clasp
a
sympathetic
bosom
in
this
frightful
wilderness
of
houses
and
faces
where
alas
i
know
not
a
human
being
you
are
a
stranger
here
said
she
quickly
have
been
here
but
a
few
hours
answered
i
you
money
she
demanded
four
guineas
and
a
half
replied
i
taking
out
my
purse
you
are
in
distress
perhaps
forgive
this
officiousness
not
for
worlds
would
i
wound
your
delicacy
but
if
you
want
assistance
have
only
this
old
sixpence
upon
earth
interrupted
she
there
for
you
miss
so
saying
she
put
sixpence
into
my
purse
which
i
had
opened
while
i
was
speaking
angel
cried
i
we
are
in
partnership
we
said
she
sweet
innocent
answered
i
are
partners
in
grief
as
grief
is
dry
cried
she
will
go
moisten
it
where
shall
we
moisten
it
maria
said
i
a
pothouse
cried
she
will
do
us
good
my
maria
said
i
never
then
give
me
back
my
sixpence
cried
she
snatching
at
my
purse
but
i
held
it
fast
and
springing
from
her
ran
away
thief
stop
thief
vociferated
she
in
an
instant
i
heard
a
sort
of
rattling
noise
from
several
quarters
and
an
old
fellow
called
a
watchman
came
running
out
of
a
wooden
box
and
seized
me
by
the
shoulder
has
robbed
me
of
my
purse
exclaimed
the
wily
wanton
a
green
one
and
has
four
guineas
and
a
half
in
it
besides
a
curious
old
sixpence
the
watchman
took
it
from
me
and
examined
it
my
purse
cried
i
i
can
swear
it
lie
said
the
little
wretch
know
well
that
you
snatched
it
out
of
my
hand
when
i
was
going
to
give
you
sixpence
out
of
charity
horror
and
astonishment
struck
me
dumb
and
when
i
told
my
tale
the
watchman
declared
that
both
of
us
must
remain
in
custody
till
next
morning
and
then
be
carried
before
the
magistrate
accordingly
he
escorted
us
to
the
watchhouse
a
room
filled
with
smoke
and
culprits
where
we
stayed
all
night
in
the
midst
of
swearing
snoring
laughing
and
crying
in
the
morning
we
were
carried
before
a
magistrate
and
with
step
superb
arms
folded
and
neck
erect
i
entered
the
room
enough
said
the
magistrate
and
turning
from
me
continued
his
examination
of
two
men
who
stood
near
him
it
appeared
that
one
of
them
whose
name
was
jerry
sullivan
had
assaulted
the
other
on
the
following
occasion
a
joint
sum
of
money
had
been
deposited
in
sullivan
hands
by
this
other
and
a
third
man
his
partner
which
sum
sullivan
had
consented
to
keep
for
them
and
had
bound
himself
to
return
whenever
both
should
go
together
to
him
and
demand
it
sometime
afterwards
one
of
them
went
to
him
and
told
him
that
the
other
being
ill
and
therefore
unable
to
come
for
the
money
had
empowered
him
to
get
it
sullivan
believing
him
gave
the
money
and
when
he
next
met
the
other
mentioned
the
circumstance
the
other
denied
having
authorized
what
had
been
done
and
demanded
his
own
share
of
the
deposit
from
sullivan
who
refused
it
words
ensued
and
sullivan
having
knocked
him
down
was
brought
before
the
magistrate
to
be
committed
for
an
assault
you
any
defence
said
the
magistrate
to
him
that
i
know
of
answered
he
i
would
knock
him
down
again
if
he
touched
my
honour
again
is
this
your
defence
said
the
magistrate
is
so
replied
sullivan
i
hope
your
worship
likes
it
as
well
as
i
like
your
worship
well
said
the
magistrate
i
now
mean
to
do
you
a
signal
service
then
cried
sullivan
the
heavens
smile
on
you
that
service
continued
the
magistrate
to
commit
you
immediately
then
cried
sullivan
the
devil
inconvenience
you
your
insolence
you
should
be
an
irishman
said
the
magistrate
was
an
irishman
forty
years
ago
replied
sullivan
i
suppose
i
am
anything
else
now
though
i
have
left
my
country
i
scorn
to
change
my
him
said
the
magistrate
just
then
a
device
struck
me
which
i
thought
might
extricate
the
poor
fellow
so
having
received
permission
i
went
across
and
whispered
it
to
him
heavens
smile
on
you
cried
he
and
then
addressed
his
accuser
i
can
prove
to
you
that
i
have
not
broken
our
agreement
about
the
money
will
you
promise
not
to
prosecute
me
for
this
assault
all
my
heart
answered
he
if
you
have
not
broken
our
agreement
you
must
have
the
money
still
which
is
all
i
want
will
your
worship
said
sullivan
this
compromise
and
stand
umpire
between
us
have
not
the
least
objection
answered
the
magistrate
i
would
rather
be
the
means
of
your
fulfilling
an
agreement
than
of
your
suffering
a
punishment
and
would
rather
recompense
your
accuser
with
money
than
with
revenge
then
said
jerry
to
his
accuser
not
our
agreement
that
i
should
return
the
money
to
yourself
and
your
partner
whenever
you
came
together
to
me
and
asked
for
it
said
the
man
did
you
both
ever
come
together
to
me
and
ask
for
it
said
the
man
i
have
not
broken
our
agreement
cried
sullivan
you
can
not
keep
it
said
the
other
you
have
given
away
the
money
matter
for
that
cried
sullivan
i
have
it
when
both
of
you
come
to
demand
it
but
i
believe
that
will
be
never
for
the
fellow
who
ran
off
will
not
much
like
to
shew
his
face
again
so
now
will
your
worship
please
to
decide
the
magistrate
after
complimenting
me
upon
my
ingenuity
confessed
he
said
with
much
unwillingness
that
sullivan
had
made
out
his
case
clearly
the
poor
accuser
was
therefore
obliged
to
abide
by
his
promise
and
sullivan
was
dismissed
snapping
his
fingers
and
offering
to
treat
the
whole
world
with
a
tankard
my
cause
came
after
and
the
treacherous
maria
was
ordered
to
state
her
evidence
but
what
think
you
biddy
of
my
keeping
you
in
suspense
till
my
next
letter
the
practice
of
keeping
in
suspense
is
quite
common
among
novelists
nay
there
is
a
lady
in
the
romance
of
the
highlands
who
terminates
not
her
letter
but
her
life
much
in
the
same
style
for
when
dying
she
was
about
to
disclose
the
circumstances
of
a
horrid
murder
and
would
have
done
so
too
had
she
not
unfortunately
expended
her
last
breath
in
a
beautiful
description
of
the
verdant
hills
rising
sun
all
nature
smiling
and
a
few
streaks
of
purple
in
the
east
adieu
letter
viii
maria
being
ordered
to
state
her
evidence
i
will
said
she
i
am
so
ashamed
of
having
been
out
late
at
night
but
i
must
tell
your
worship
how
that
happened
need
not
said
the
magistrate
then
she
continued
was
walking
innocently
home
with
my
poor
eyes
fixed
upon
the
ground
for
fear
of
the
fellors
when
what
should
i
see
but
this
girl
talking
on
some
steps
with
a
pickpocket
i
fancy
for
he
looked
pretty
decent
so
i
ran
past
them
for
i
was
so
ashamed
you
ca
think
and
this
girl
runs
after
me
and
says
says
she
the
fellor
would
give
me
a
little
shilling
says
she
so
by
jingo
you
must
says
she
jingo
i
say
by
jingo
cried
i
catherine
guard
me
indeed
your
excellenza
my
only
oath
is
santa
maria
swore
at
me
like
a
trooper
continued
the
little
imp
i
pulled
out
my
purse
in
a
fright
and
she
snatched
it
from
me
and
ran
away
and
i
after
her
calling
stop
thief
and
this
is
the
whole
truth
my
honour
and
word
and
as
i
hope
to
be
married
the
watchman
declared
that
he
had
caught
me
running
away
that
he
had
found
the
purse
in
my
hand
and
that
maria
had
described
it
and
the
money
contained
in
it
accurately
will
your
worship
said
maria
the
girl
to
describe
the
sixpence
that
is
in
it
the
magistrate
turned
to
me
said
i
i
never
even
saw
it
i
can
not
possibly
pretend
to
describe
it
i
can
cried
she
bent
in
two
places
and
stamped
on
one
of
its
sides
with
a
d
and
an
the
sixpence
was
examined
and
answered
her
description
of
it
case
is
clear
enough
said
the
magistrate
now
miss
try
whether
you
can
advocate
your
own
cause
as
well
as
jerry
sullivan
jerry
who
still
remained
in
the
room
came
behind
me
and
whispered
miss
i
have
no
brains
but
i
have
a
bit
of
an
oath
if
that
is
of
any
use
to
you
i
would
sell
my
soul
out
of
gratitude
at
any
time
your
excellenza
said
i
to
the
magistrate
is
the
tenure
of
that
character
which
has
innocence
for
its
friend
and
infamy
for
its
foe
life
is
a
chequered
scene
of
light
and
shade
life
is
a
jest
a
stage
of
life
is
not
the
way
to
save
it
said
the
magistrate
sentiment
and
more
point
if
you
please
i
was
silent
but
looked
anxiously
towards
the
door
you
meditating
an
escape
asked
he
said
i
just
wait
a
little
and
you
shall
see
what
an
interesting
turn
affairs
will
take
cried
he
at
once
or
say
you
will
not
now
said
i
you
stop
one
moment
and
not
spoil
everything
by
your
impatience
i
am
only
watching
for
the
tall
elegant
young
stranger
with
an
oval
face
who
is
to
enter
just
at
this
crisis
and
snatch
me
from
perdition
he
promise
to
come
said
the
magistrate
at
all
answered
i
i
have
never
seen
the
man
in
my
life
but
whoever
rescues
me
now
you
know
is
destined
to
marry
me
hereafter
that
is
the
rule
are
an
impudent
minx
said
the
magistrate
shall
pay
dear
for
your
jocularity
have
you
parents
can
not
tell
do
you
live
where
least
is
plain
where
you
will
die
what
is
your
name
what
know
not
know
i
protest
this
is
the
most
hardened
profligate
i
have
ever
met
commit
her
instantly
i
now
saw
that
something
must
be
done
so
summoning
all
my
most
assuasive
airs
i
related
the
whole
adventure
just
as
it
had
occurred
not
a
syllable
obtained
belief
the
fatal
sixpence
carried
all
before
it
i
recollected
the
fate
of
angelica
angela
angelina
and
shuddered
what
should
i
do
one
desperate
experiment
remained
were
four
guineas
and
half
a
guinea
in
the
purse
said
i
to
the
girl
be
sure
there
were
cried
she
cunning
you
are
to
tell
me
my
own
news
said
i
me
at
once
and
without
hesitation
whether
it
is
the
half
guinea
or
one
of
the
guineas
that
is
notched
in
three
places
like
the
teeth
of
a
saw
she
paused
a
little
and
then
said
have
a
long
story
to
tell
about
those
same
notches
i
wanted
a
silk
handkerchief
yesterday
so
i
went
into
a
shop
to
buy
one
and
an
impudent
ugly
young
fellor
was
behind
the
counter
well
he
began
ogling
me
so
i
was
quite
ashamed
and
says
he
to
me
there
is
the
change
of
your
two
pound
note
says
he
a
guinea
and
a
half
in
gold
says
he
and
you
are
vastly
handsome
says
he
and
there
are
three
notches
in
one
of
the
coins
says
he
guess
which
says
he
but
it
will
pass
all
the
same
says
he
and
you
are
prodigious
pretty
says
he
so
indeed
i
was
so
ashamed
that
though
i
looked
at
the
money
and
saw
the
three
notches
i
have
quite
forgotten
which
they
were
in
guinea
or
half
guinea
for
my
sight
spread
so
with
shame
at
his
compliments
that
the
half
guinea
looked
as
big
as
the
guinea
well
out
i
ran
blushing
like
a
poor
terrified
little
thing
and
sure
enough
a
horrid
accident
was
near
happening
me
in
my
hurry
for
i
was
just
running
under
the
wheel
of
a
carriage
when
a
gentleman
catches
me
in
his
arms
and
says
he
you
are
prodigious
pretty
says
he
and
i
frowned
so
you
ca
think
and
i
am
sure
i
never
remembered
to
look
at
the
money
since
and
this
is
the
whole
truth
i
pledge
you
my
credit
and
honour
and
the
immaculate
as
the
gentlemen
say
the
accusing
witness
who
insulted
the
magistrate
bench
with
the
oath
leered
as
she
gave
it
in
and
the
recording
clerk
as
he
wrote
it
down
drew
a
line
under
the
words
and
pointed
them
out
for
ever
you
saw
the
three
notches
said
i
plain
as
i
see
you
now
replied
she
a
guilty
poor
thing
you
look
yet
said
i
his
excellenza
examines
he
will
find
that
there
is
not
a
single
notch
in
any
one
of
the
coins
the
case
indeed
said
the
magistrate
after
looking
at
them
he
then
questioned
both
of
us
more
minutely
and
turning
to
me
said
conduct
young
woman
is
unaccountable
but
as
your
accuser
has
certainly
belied
herself
she
has
probably
belied
you
the
money
by
her
own
account
can
not
be
her
but
as
it
was
found
in
your
possession
it
may
be
your
i
therefore
feel
fully
justified
in
restoring
it
to
you
and
in
acquitting
you
of
the
crime
laid
to
your
charge
jerry
sullivan
uttered
a
shout
of
joy
i
received
the
purse
with
silent
dignity
gave
maria
back
her
sixpence
and
hurried
out
of
the
room
jerry
followed
me
then
cried
he
shaking
me
heartily
by
the
hand
as
we
walked
along
tell
me
how
i
can
serve
you
and
is
i
am
the
man
that
will
do
it
though
to
be
sure
you
must
be
the
greatest
little
scapegrace
bless
your
heart
in
the
three
kingdoms
said
i
mistake
my
character
i
am
heiress
to
an
immense
territory
and
a
heroine
the
proudest
title
that
can
adorn
a
woman
never
heard
of
that
title
before
said
jerry
i
warrant
is
no
better
than
it
should
be
shall
judge
for
yourself
said
i
heroine
is
a
young
lady
rather
taller
than
usual
and
often
an
orphan
at
all
events
possessed
of
the
finest
eyes
in
the
world
though
her
frame
is
so
fragile
that
a
breath
of
wind
might
scatter
it
like
chaff
it
is
sometimes
stouter
than
a
statue
of
cast
iron
she
blushes
to
the
tips
of
her
fingers
and
when
other
girls
would
laugh
she
faints
besides
she
has
tears
sighs
and
half
sighs
at
command
lives
a
month
on
a
mouthful
and
is
addicted
to
the
pale
consumption
then
much
good
may
it
do
her
cried
jerry
in
my
mind
a
phthisicky
girl
is
no
great
treasure
and
as
for
the
fashion
of
living
a
month
on
a
mouthful
let
me
have
a
potatoe
and
chop
for
my
dinner
and
a
herring
on
saturday
nights
and
i
would
not
give
a
farthing
for
all
the
starvation
you
could
offer
me
so
when
i
finish
my
bit
of
herring
my
wife
says
to
me
winking
a
fish
loves
water
says
she
and
immediately
she
fetches
me
a
dram
are
the
delights
of
vulgar
life
said
i
to
be
thin
innocent
and
lyrical
to
bind
and
unbind
her
hair
in
a
word
to
be
the
most
miserable
creature
that
ever
augmented
a
brook
with
tears
these
my
friend
are
the
glories
of
a
heroine
glories
by
dad
cried
jerry
as
i
am
a
poor
man
and
not
particular
i
can
contrive
to
make
shift
with
health
and
happiness
and
to
rub
through
life
without
binding
my
bind
it
by
the
powers
seldom
i
even
comb
it
as
i
was
all
this
time
without
my
bonnet
for
in
my
hurry
from
betterton
i
had
left
it
behind
me
i
determined
to
purchase
one
so
i
went
into
a
shop
with
jerry
and
asked
the
woman
of
it
for
an
interesting
and
melancholy
turn
of
bonnet
she
looked
at
me
with
some
surprise
but
produced
several
and
i
fixed
on
one
which
resembled
a
bonnet
that
i
had
once
seen
in
a
picture
of
a
wood
nymph
so
i
put
it
on
me
wished
the
woman
good
morning
and
was
walking
away
have
forgotten
to

she
replied

cried
she
ringing
a
bell
and
a
man
entered
instantly
from
an
inner
room
is
a
hussey
exclaimed
she
refuses
to

dad
said
jerry

the
first
of
all
ways
to
lose
an
acquaintance
bonnet
or
the
money
cried
the
man
stepping
between
me
and
the
door
the
one
nor
the
other
answered
i
sir
to
run
in
debt
is
part
of
my
plan
and
by
what
right
dare
you
interfere
to
save
me
from
ruin
pretty
indeed
that
a
girl
at
my
time
of
life
can
not
select
her
own
misfortunes
sir
your
conduct
astonishes
shocks
disgusts
me
to
such
a
reasonable
appeal
the
man
could
not
reply
so
he
snatched
at
my
bonnet
jerry
jumped
forward
and
arrested
his
arm
off
bully
cried
the
shopman
in
troth
said
jerry
the
more
you
bid
me
the
more
i
let
you
go
if
her
ladyship
has
set
her
heart
on
a
robbery
i
am
not
the
man
to
balk
her
fancy
sure
did
not
she
save
me
from
a
gaol
and
sure
would
not
i
help
her
to
a
bonnet
a
bonnet
my
conscience
she
shall
have
half
a
dozen
is
i
that
would
not
much
mind
being
hanged
for
her
so
saying
he
snatched
a
parcel
of
bonnets
from
the
counter
and
was
instantly
knocked
down
by
the
shopman
he
rose
and
both
began
a
furious
conflict
in
the
midst
of
it
i
was
attempting
to
rush
from
the
shop
when
i
found
my
spangled
muslin
barbarously
seized
by
the
woman
who
tore
it
to
pieces
in
the
struggle
and
pulling
off
the
bonnet
gave
me
a
horrid
slap
in
the
face
i
would
have
cuffed
her
nicely
in
return
only
that
she
was
more
than
my
match
but
i
stamped
at
her
with
my
feet
at
first
i
was
shocked
at
having
made
this
unheroic
gesture
till
i
luckily
recollected
that
amanda
once
stamped
at
an
amorous
footman
meantime
jerry
had
stunned
his
adversary
with
a
blow
so
taking
this
opportunity
of
escape
he
dragged
me
with
him
from
the
shop
and
hurried
me
through
several
streets
without
uttering
a
word
at
length
i
was
so
much
exhausted
that
we
stopped
and
strange
figures
we
were
jerry
face
smeared
with
blood
nothing
on
my
head
my
long
hair
hanging
loose
about
me
and
my
poor
spangled
muslin
all
in
rags
said
jerry
to
an
old
woman
who
was
selling
apples
at
the
corner
of
the
street
care
of
this
young
body
while
i
fetch
her
a
coach
and
off
he
ran
the
woman
looked
at
me
with
a
suspicious
eye
so
i
resolved
to
gain
her
good
opinion
it
struck
me
that
i
might
extract
pathos
from
an
apple
and
taking
one
from
her
stall
apple
my
charming
old
friend
said
i
the
symbol
of
discord
eve
lost
paradise
by
tasting
it
paris
exasperated
juno
by
throwing
it
a
loud
burst
of
laughter
made
me
turn
round
and
i
perceived
a
crowd
already
at
my
elbow
tore
her
gown
said
one
her
spangles
said
another
her
hair
cried
a
third
long
enough
to
hang
her
cried
a
fourth
king
hemp
will
do
that
job
for
her
added
a
fifth
a
pull
at
my
muslin
assailed
me
on
the
one
side
and
when
i
turned
about
my
hair
was
thrown
over
my
face
on
the
other
people
said
i
know
not
whom
you
thus
insult
i
am
descended
from
illustrious
and
perhaps
italian
parents
a
butcher
boy
advanced
and
putting
half
a
hat
under
his
arm
your
ladyship
said
he
me
to
hand
you
into
that
there
shop
i
bowed
assent
and
he
led
me
nothing
loath
peals
of
laughter
followed
us
said
i
as
i
stood
at
the
door
will
reward
your
gallantry
with
half
a
guinea
as
i
drew
forth
my
money
i
saw
his
face
reddening
his
cheeks
swelling
and
his
mouth
pursing
up
delicate
sensibility
said
i
positively
you
must
not
refuse
this
trifle
he
took
it
and
then
just
think
the
brute
laughed
in
my
face
will
give
this
guinea
cried
i
quite
enraged
the
first
who
knocks
that
ungrateful
down
hardly
had
i
spoken
when
he
was
laid
prostrate
he
fell
against
the
stall
upset
it
and
instantly
the
street
was
strewn
with
apples
nuts
and
cakes
he
rose
the
battle
raged
some
sided
with
him
some
against
him
the
furious
pelted
both
parties
with
her
own
apples
while
the
only
discreet
person
there
was
a
ragged
little
girl
who
stood
laughing
at
a
distance
and
eating
one
of
the
cakes
in
the
midst
of
the
fray
jerry
returned
with
a
coach
i
sprang
into
it
and
he
after
me
guinea
the
guinea
cried
twenty
voices
at
once
at
once
twenty
apples
came
rattling
against
the
glasses
me
for
my
apples
cried
the
woman
me
for
my
windows
cried
the
coachman
like
a
devil
cried
jerry
i
will
pay
you
like
an
emperor
the
same
sort
of
persons
said
the
coachman
and
away
we
flew
the
guinea
the
guinea
died
along
the
sky
i
thought
i
should
have
dropt
with
laughter
my
dear
friend
do
you
not
sympathize
with
my
sorrows
desolate
destitute
and
dependent
on
strangers
what
is
to
become
of
me
i
declare
i
am
extremely
unhappy
i
write
from
jerry
house
where
i
have
taken
refuge
for
the
present
and
as
soon
as
i
am
settled
elsewhere
you
shall
hear
from
me
again
adieu
letter
ix
jerry
sullivan
is
a
petty
woollendraper
in
giles
and
occupies
the
of
a
small
house
at
first
his
wife
and
daughter
eyed
me
with
some
suspicion
but
when
he
told
them
how
i
had
saved
him
from
ruin
and
that
i
was
somehow
or
other
a
great
lady
in
disguise
they
became
very
civil
and
gave
me
a
tolerable
breakfast
then
fatigued
and
sleepy
i
threw
myself
on
a
bed
and
slept
till
two
i
woke
with
pains
in
all
my
limbs
but
anxious
to
forward
the
adventures
of
my
life
i
rose
and
called
mother
and
daughter
to
a
consultation
on
my
dress
they
furnished
me
with
their
best
habiliments
for
which
i
agreed
to
give
them
two
guineas
and
i
then
began
equipping
myself
while
thus
employed
i
heard
the
voices
of
husband
and
wife
in
the
next
room
rising
gradually
to
the
matrimonial
key
at
last
the
wife
exclaims
heroine
i
will
take
my
corporal
oath
there
is
no
such
title
in
all
england
and
if
she
has
the
four
guineas
she
never
came
honestly
by
them
so
the
sooner
she
parts
with
them
the
better
and
not
a
step
shall
she
stir
in
our
cloathes
till
she
launches
forth
three
of
them
so
that
that
and
mine
my
own
and
how
do
you
like
my
manners
ignoramus
dare
you
call
me
ignoramus
cried
jerry
if
you
like
but
no
ignoramus
i
believe
i
know
what
i
could
call
you
though
cried
she
a
drunkard
and
a
scold
what
else
can
you
call
me
wo
speak
another
word
to
you
said
jerry
would
not
speak
to
you
if
you
were
lying
dead
in
the
kennel
you
an
ugly
unnatural
beast
so
you
are
cried
she
your
miss
is
no
better
than
a
bad
one
and
i
warrant
you
understand
one
another
well
this
last
insinuation
was
sufficient
for
me
what
remain
in
a
house
where
suspicion
attached
to
my
character
what
act
so
diametrically
so
outrageously
contrary
to
the
principle
of
aspersed
heroines
who
are
sure
on
such
occasions
to
pin
up
a
bundle
and
set
off
i
spurned
the
mean
idea
and
resolved
to
decamp
instantly
so
having
hastened
my
toilette
i
threw
three
guineas
on
the
table
and
then
looked
for
a
pen
and
ink
to
write
a
sonnet
on
gratitude
i
could
find
nothing
however
but
a
small
bit
of
chalk
and
with
this
substitute
i
scratched
the
following
lines
on
the
wall
sonnet
on
gratitude
to
jerry
as
some
deputed
angel
from
the
spheres
of
empyrean
day
with
nectar
dewed
through
firmamental
wildernesses
steers
to
starless
tracts
of
black
infinitude
here
the
chalk
failed
me
and
just
at
the
critical
moment
for
my
simile
had
also
failed
me
nor
could
i
have
ever
gotten
beyond
infinitude
i
got
to
the
street
door
however
and
without
fear
of
being
overheard
to
such
an
altitude
of
tone
had
words
arisen
between
husband
and
wife
who
were
now
contesting
a
most
delicate
point
which
of
them
had
beaten
the
other
last
know
cried
jerry
i
gave
the
last
blow
take
the
first
now
cried
his
wife
as
i
shut
the
door
anticipating
the
probability
that
i
should
have
occasion
for
services
again
i
marked
the
number
of
the
house
and
then
hastened
along
the
street
it
was
swarming
and
humming
like
a
hive
of
bees
and
i
felt
as
if
i
could
never
escape
alive
out
of
it
here
a
carriage
almost
ran
over
me
there
a
waggoner
whip
almost
blinded
me
now
a
sweep
brushed
against
me
cried
a
man
like
a
monkey
and
chucked
my
chin
while
a
fellow
with
a
trunk
shoved
me
aside
i
now
turned
into
a
street
called
bond
street
where
a
long
procession
of
carriages
was
passing
i
remarked
that
the
coachmen
they
could
not
be
gentlemen
i
am
sure
appeared
to
stand
in
great
estimation
for
the
ladies
of
one
carriage
used
to
nod
most
familiarly
to
the
driver
of
another
indeed
i
had
often
heard
it
said
that
ladies
and
coachmen
are
sometimes
particularly
intimate
but
till
now
i
could
never
believe
it
the
shops
next
attracted
my
attention
and
i
stopped
to
look
at
some
of
them
you
can
not
conceive
any
thing
more
charming
turkish
turbans
indian
shawls
pearls
diamonds
fans
feathers
laces
all
shewn
for
nothing
at
the
windows
i
had
but
one
guinea
remaining
at
length
feeling
tired
and
hungry
and
my
feet
being
quite
foundered
i
determined
to
lose
no
farther
time
in
taking
lodgings
perceiving
to
let
written
on
a
door
i
rapped
and
a
servant
girl
opened
it
said
i
to
her
your
northern
apartments
uninhabited
she
replied
that
there
were
two
rooms
on
the
second
floor
disengaged
and
comfortably
furnished
do
not
want
them
comfortable
said
i
are
they
furnished
with
tapestry
and
old
pictures
that
is
the
point
is
only
master
face
over
the
chimney
said
she
the
doors
creek
on
their
hinges
asked
i
they
do
said
she
i
oiled
all
only
yesterday
you
shewed
a
depraved
taste
cried
i
least
are
the
apartments
haunted
no
said
she
half
shutting
the
door
then
my
good
girl
tell
me
candidly
whether
your
mistress
is
like
the
landladies
one
reads
of
is
she
a
fat
bustling
little
woman
who
would
treat
me
to
tea
cakes
and
plenty
of
gossip
and
at
the
end
of
a
week
say
to
me
out
hussy
tramp
this
moment
or
is
she
a
pale
placid
matron
worn
to
a
and
whose
story
is
interwoven
with
mine
take
your
impudence
cried
she
slapping
the
door
in
my
face
i
tried
other
houses
with
no
better
success
and
even
when
i
merely
asked
for
common
lodgings
without
stipulating
for
spectres
or
tapestry
the
people
would
not
accommodate
me
unless
i
could
procure
some
recommendation
besides
my
own
as
i
had
no
friend
to
give
me
a
character
it
became
necessary
to
make
a
friend
so
i
began
to
look
about
for
a
fit
subject
passing
a
shop
where
eggs
and
butter
were
sold
and
lodgings
to
be
let
i
perceived
a
pretty
woman
sitting
behind
the
counter
and
a
fine
infant
playing
upon
it
i
thought
that
all
this
bore
an
auspicious
appearance
so
i
tottered
into
the
shop
and
placing
myself
opposite
to
the
woman
i
gazed
at
her
with
an
engaging
and
gentle
intelligence
she
demanded
my
business
creature
whispered
i
pressing
her
hand
as
it
rested
on
the
counter
may
that
little
rosy
fatling
unfortunately
there
was
an
egg
in
the
hand
that
i
took
which
i
crushed
by
the
compression
and
the
yolk
came
oozing
between
her
fingers
cried
she
as
she
threw
the
fragments
in
my
face
cried
i
as
i
ran
out
of
the
shop
and
wiped
off
the
eggy
dishonours
at
length
i
reached
an
immense
edifice
which
appeared
to
me
the
castle
of
some
baron
ponderous
columns
supported
it
and
statues
stood
in
the
niches
the
portal
lay
open
i
glided
into
the
hall
as
i
looked
anxiously
around
i
beheld
a
cavalier
descending
a
flight
of
steps
he
paused
muttered
some
words
laid
his
hand
upon
his
heart
dropped
it
shook
his
head
and
proceeded
i
felt
instantly
interested
in
his
fate
and
as
he
came
nearer
perceived
that
surely
never
lighted
on
this
orb
which
he
hardly
seemed
to
touch
a
more
delightful
vision
his
form
was
tall
his
face
oval
and
his
nose
aquiline
seducing
sweetness
dwelled
in
his
smile
and
as
he
pleased
his
expressive
eyes
could
sparkle
with
rapture
or
beam
with
sensibility
once
more
he
paused
frowned
and
waving
his
arm
exclaimed
with
an
elegant
energy
of
enunciation
watch
the
minutes
of
this
night
that
if
again
this
apparition
come
he
may
approve
our
eyes
and
speak
to
it
that
moment
a
pang
poignant
but
delicious
transfixed
my
bosom
too
well
i
felt
and
confessed
it
the
dart
of
love
in
sooth
too
well
i
knew
that
my
heart
was
lost
to
me
for
ever
silly
maiden
but
fate
had
decreed
it
i
rushed
forward
and
sank
at
the
feet
of
the
stranger
and
protect
a
destitute
orphan
cried
i
in
this
hospitable
castle
i
may
hope
for
repose
and
protection
oh
signor
conduct
me
to
your
respected
mother
the
baroness
and
let
me
pour
into
her
ear
my
simple
and
pathetic
tale
ho
simple
and
pathetic
cried
he
my
dear
let
me
hear
it
i
seated
myself
on
the
steps
and
told
him
my
whole
story
during
the
recital
the
noble
youth
betrayed
extreme
sensibility
sometimes
he
turned
his
head
aside
to
conceal
his
emotion
and
sometimes
stifled
a
hysterical
laugh
of
agony
when
i
had
ended
he
begged
to
know
whether
i
was
quite
certain
that
i
had
ten
thousand
pounds
in
my
power
i
replied
that
as
daughter
i
certainly
had
but
that
the
property
must
devolve
to
some
one
else
as
soon
as
i
should
be
proved
a
nobleman
daughter
he
then
made
still
more
accurate
inquiries
about
it
and
after
having
satisfied
himself
my
heart
exclaimed
he
i
will
avenge
your
injuries
and
ere
long
you
shall
be
proclaimed
and
acknowledged
the
lady
cherubina
de
willoughby
meantime
as
it
will
be
prudent
for
you
to
lie
concealed
from
the
search
of
your
enemies
hear
the
project
which
i
have
formed
i
lodge
at
present
in
an
obscure
street
and
as
one
apartment
in
the
house
is
unoccupied
you
can
hire
it
and
remain
there
a
beautiful
recluse
till
fortune
and
my
poor
efforts
shall
rescue
from
oppression
the
most
enchanting
of
her
sex
he
spoke
and
seizing
my
hand
carried
it
to
his
lips
cried
i
you
not
live
in
this
castle
and
are
you
not
its
noble
heir

he
covent

said
i
me

have
the
satisfaction
of
wishing
you

very
good

he
detaining
me
you
shall
know
the
whole
truth
my

and
my
real
name
lord
altamont
mortimer
montmorenci
but
like
you
i
am
enveloped
in
a
cloud
of
mysteries
and
compelled
to
the
temporary
resource
of
acting
hereafter
i
will
acquaint
you
with
the
most
secret
particulars
of
my
life
but
at
present
you
must
trust
to
my
good
faith
and
accept
of
my
protection
montmorenci
exclaimed
i
giving
him
my
hand
which
he
pressed
upon
his
heart
said
he
must
pass
at
these
lodgings
as
my
near
relation
or
they
will
not
admit
you
at
first
i
hesitated
at
deviating
from
veracity
but
soon
consented
on
recollecting
that
though
heroines
begin
with
praising
truth
necessity
makes
them
end
with
being
the
greatest
in
the
world
nay
clarissa
harlowe
when
she
had
a
choice
often
preferred
falsehood
to
fact
during
our
walk
to
the
lodgings
montmorenci
instructed
me
how
to
play
my
part
and
on
our
arrival
introduced
me
to
the
landlady
who
was
about
fifty
and
who
looked
as
if
the
goddess
of
fasting
had
bespoken
her
for
a
with
an
amiable
effrontery
and
a
fine
easy
flow
of
falsehood
he
told
her
as
we
had
concerted
that
i
was
his
second
cousin
and
an
orphan
my
name
miss
donald
amanda
assumed
name
and
that
i
had
come
to
town
for
the
purpose
of
procuring
by
his
interest
an
appointment
at
the
theatre
the
landlady
said
she
would
move
heaven
and
earth
and
her
own
bed
for
so
good
a
gentleman
and
then
consented
to
give
me
her
on
the
at
some
trifle
or
other
i
forget
what
i
have
also
the
use
of
a
parlour
adjoining
it
there
is
however
nothing
mysterious
in
these
chambers
but
a
dark
closet
belonging
to
the
parlour
whither
i
may
fly
for
refuge
when
pursued
by
my
persecutors
thus
my
friend
the
plot
of
my
history
begins
to
take
a
more
interesting
shape
and
a
fairer
order
of
misfortune
smiles
upon
me
trust
me
there
is
a
taste
in
distress
as
well
as
in
millinery
far
be
from
me
the
loss
of
eyes
or
limbs
such
publicity
as
the
pillory
affords
or
the
grossness
of
a
i
would
be
sacrificed
to
the
lawless
not
to
the
laws
dungeoned
in
the
holy
inquisition
not
clapped
into
bridewell
recorded
in
a
novel
not
in
the
newgate
calender
were
i
inelegantly
unhappy
i
should
be
wretched
indeed
yes
my
biddy
sensations
hitherto
unknown
now
heave
my
white
bosom
vary
the
carnation
of
my
cheeks
and
irradiate
my
azure
eyes
i
sigh
gaze
on
vacancy
start
from
a
reverie
now
bite
now
moisten
my
coral
lip
and
pace
my
chamber
with
unequal
steps
too
sure
i
am
deeply
distractedly
in
love
and
altamont
mortimer
montmorenci
is
the
first
of
men
adieu
letter
x
the
landlady
his
lordship
and
another
lodger
are
accustomed
to
dine
in
common
and
his
lordship
easily
persuaded
me
to
join
the
party
accordingly
just
as
i
had
finished
my
last
letter
dinner
was
announced
so
having
braided
my
tresses
i
tripped
up
stairs
and
glided
into
the
room
you
must
know
i
have
practised
tripping
gliding
flitting
and
tottering
with
great
success
of
these
tottering
ranks
first
as
it
is
the
approved
movement
of
heroic
distress
wonder
where
our
mad
poet
can
be
said
the
hostess
and
as
she
spoke
an
uncouth
figure
entered
muttering
in
emphatic
accents
hounds
around
bound
on
the
sounding
ground
he
started
on
seeing
me
and
when
introduced
by
his
lordship
as
higginson
his
fellow
lodger
and
a
celebrated
poet
he
made
an
unfathomable
bow
rubbed
his
hands
and
reddened
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
this
personage
is
tall
gaunt
and
muscular
with
a
cadaverous
countenance
and
black
hair
in
strings
on
his
forehead
i
find
him
one
of
those
men
who
spend
their
lives
in
learning
how
the
greeks
and
romans
lived
how
they
spoke
dressed
ate
what
were
their
coins
and
houses
but
neglect
acquainting
themselves
with
the
manners
and
customs
of
their
own
times
montmorenci
tells
me
that
his
brain
is
affected
by
excessive
study
but
that
his
manners
are
harmless
at
dinner
montmorenci
looked
all
said
all
did
all
which
conscious
nobility
united
with
ardent
attachment
could
inspire
in
a
form
unrivalled
and
a
face
unexcelled
i
perceived
that
the
landlady
regarded
him
with
eyes
of
tender
attention
and
languishing
allurement
but
in
vain
i
was
his
magnet
and
his
cynosure
as
to
higginson
he
did
not
utter
a
word
during
dinner
except
asking
for
a
bit
of
but
he
preserved
a
perpetuity
of
gravity
in
his
face
and
stared
at
me
the
whole
time
with
a
stupid
and
reverential
fixedness
when
i
spoke
he
stopped
in
whatever
attitude
he
happened
to
be
whether
with
a
glass
at
his
mouth
or
a
fork
half
lifted
to
it
after
dinner
i
proposed
that
each
of
us
should
relate
the
history
of
our
lives
an
useful
custom
established
by
heroines
who
seldom
fail
of
finding
their
account
in
it
as
they
are
almost
always
sure
to
discover
by
such
means
either
a
grandmother
or
a
murder
thus
too
the
confession
of
a
monk
the
prattle
of
an
old
woman
a
diamond
cross
on
a
child
neck
or
a
parchment
are
the
certain
forerunners
of
virtue
vindicated
vice
punished
rights
restored
and
matrimony
made
easy
the
landlady
was
asked
to
begin
have
nothing
to
tell
of
myself
said
she
that
my
mother
left
me
this
house
and
desired
me
to
look
out
for
a
good
husband
grundy
and
i
am
not
as
old
as
i
look
for
i
have
had
my
griefs
as
well
as
other
folks
and
every
tear
adds
a
year
as
they
say
and
my
veracity
grundy
i
was
but
last
month
and
my
bitterest
enemies
never
impeached
my
character
that
is
what
they
nor
they
to
my
face
i
am
a
perfect
snowdrop
for
purity
who
presumes
to
go
for
to
say
that
a
lord
left
me
an
annuity
or
the
like
who
i
ask
but
i
got
a
prize
in
the
lottery
so
this
is
all
i
can
think
to
tell
of
myself
and
grundy
your
health
and
a
good
wife
to
you
sir
after
this
eloquent
piece
of
biography
we
requested
of
higginson
to
recount
his
adventures
and
he
read
a
short
sketch
which
was
to
have
accompanied
a
volume
of
poems
had
not
the
booksellers
refused
to
publish
them
i
copy
it
for
you
memoirs
of
james
higginson
by
himself
the
lives
of
poets
collected
from
posthumous
record
and
oral
tradition
as
little
is
known
with
certainty
much
must
be
left
to
conjecture
he
therefore
who
presents
his
own
memoirs
to
the
public
may
surely
merit
the
reasonable
applause
of
all
whose
minds
are
emancipated
from
the
petulance
of
envy
the
fastidiousness
of
hypercriticism
and
the
exacerbation
of
party
was
born
in
the
year
at
swallow
street
and
should
the
curious
reader
wish
to
examine
the
mansion
he
has
every
thing
to
hope
from
the
alert
urbanity
of
its
present
landlord
and
the
civil
obsequiousness
of
his
notable
lady
he
who
gives
civility
gives
what
costs
him
little
while
remuneration
may
be
multiplied
in
an
indefinite
ratio
parents
were
reputable
tobacconists
and
kept
me
behind
the
counter
to
negociate
the
titillating
dust
and
the
tranquillizing
quid
of
genius
the
first
spark
which
i
elicited
was
reading
a
ballad
in
the
shop
while
the
woman
who
sold
it
to
me
was
stealing
a
canister
of
snuff
this
specimen
of
mental
abstraction
a
quality
which
i
still
preserve
shewed
that
i
would
never
make
a
good
tradesman
but
it
also
shewed
that
i
would
make
an
excellent
scholar
a
tutor
was
accordingly
appointed
for
me
and
during
a
triennial
course
of
study
i
had
passed
from
the
insipidity
of
the
incipient
to
the
music
of
a
virgil
and
the
thunder
of
a
demosthenes
by
my
secluded
life
from
copying
the
polished
converse
of
high
society
i
have
at
least
endeavoured
to
avoid
the
vulgar
phraseology
of
low
and
to
discuss
the
very
weather
with
a
sententious
association
of
polysyllabical
ratiocination
illustrations
of
my
juvenile
character
recollection
but
ill
supplies
me
that
i
have
always
disliked
the
diurnal
ceremony
of
ablution
and
a
hasty
succession
of
linen
is
a
truth
which
he
who
has
a
sensitive
texture
of
skin
will
easily
credit
which
he
who
will
not
credit
may
if
he
pleases
deny
and
may
if
he
can
controvert
but
i
assert
the
fact
and
i
expect
to
be
believed
because
i
assert
it
life
among
its
quiet
blessings
can
boast
of
few
things
more
comfortable
than
indifference
to
dress
honey
with
my
bread
and
to
with
my
goose
i
have
ever
felt
a
romantic
attachment
resulting
from
the
classical
allusions
which
they
inspire
that
man
is
little
to
be
envied
whose
honey
would
not
remind
him
of
the
hyblean
honey
and
whose
would
not
suggest
to
him
the
golden
apple
notwithstanding
my
cupidity
for
such
dainties
i
have
that
happy
adaptation
of
taste
which
can
banquet
with
delight
upon
hesternal
offals
can
nibble
ignominious
radishes
or
masticate
superannuated
mutton
first

of
teeth

cut
at
the
customary
time
and
the
second

them
with
sufficient
punctuality

i
had
from
my
mother

poetical
attempt

an
epitaph
on
the
death
of
my

and
it

of

not

survive

my

business
feeling
quite
unequal
relinquished
it
altogether
and
retired
with
the
respectable
accumulation
of
a

pounds
still
pursued
my
studies
and
from
time
to

accommodated

with

the
booksellers
have
declined
to
publish
my
productions

all
envious

their

against

and
persuade
them
that
my
brain
is

for
like

for

let
the
sedulous
researches
of
future
biographers
decide
length
having
resolved
on
writing
a
volume
of
eclogues
i
undertook
an
excursion
into
the
country
to
learn
pastoral
manners
and
write
in
comfort
far
from
my
tailor
an
amputated
loaf
and
a
contracted
theocritus

my
companions

cloud
blotted

blue
concave
not
a

superinduced
undulation
over
the
verdant
tresses
of
the
trees
vain
i
questioned
the
youths
and
maidens
about
their
damons
and
delias
their
dryads
and
hamadryads
their
amaboean
contentions
and
their
amorous
incantations
when
i
talked
of
pan
they
asked
me
if
it
was
a
pan
of
milk
when
i
requested
to
see
the
pastoral
pipe
they
shewed
me
a
pipe
of
tobacco
when
i
spoke
of
satyrs
with
horns
they
bade
me
go
to
the
husbands
and
when
i
spoke
of
fawns
with
cloven
heel
they
bade
me
go
to
the
devil
while
charmed
with
a
thatched
and
shaded
cottage
its
slimy
pond
or
smoking
dunghill
disgusted
me
and
when
i
recumbed
on
a
bank
of
cowslips
and
primroses
my
features
were
transpierced
by
wasps
and
ants
and
nettles
i
fell
asleep
under
sunshine
and
awoke
under
a
torrent
of
rain
dripping
and
disconsolate
i
returned
to
my
mother
drank
some
whey
and
since
that
misadventurous
perambulation
have
never
ruralized
again
to
him
who
subjects
himself
to
a
recurrence
of
disaster
the
praise
of
boldness
may
possibly
be
accorded
but
the
praise
of
prudence
must
certainly
be
denied
satirical
eclogue
however
was
the
fruit
of
this
expedition
it
is
called
antique
amours
and
is
designed
to
shew
that
passions
which
are
adapted
to
one
time
of
life
appear
ridiculous
in
another
the
reader
shall
have
it

remains
of
once
a
youth

staff
his
frame
sustains
and
aids
his
aching
limbs
from
knee
to

thin
as
the
spectre
of
a
famished
eel
sharpening
the
blunted
glances
of
her
eyes
the
virgin
a
decrepid
simper
tries
then
stretches
rigid
smiles
which
shew
him
plain
her
passion
and
the
teeth
that
still
remain
innocent
pair
but
now
the
rain
begins
so
both
knot

venerable

now
pass

no

we
have
no
scandal
ourselves
therefore
we
make
our
favourite
topic
and
ourselves
we
are
unwilling
to
dispraise
the
public
will
admire
my
works
as
well
as
my
mother
does
far
be
from
me
to
determine
if
they
can
not
boast
of
wit
and
judgment
to
the
praise
of
truth
and
modesty
they
may
at
least
lay
claim
to
be
unassuming
in
an
age
of
impudence
and
veracious
in
an
age
of
mendacity
is
to
combat
with
a
sword
of
glass
against
a
sword
of
steel
the
transparency
of
the
one
may
be
more
beautiful
than
the
opacity
of
the
other
yet
let
it
be
recollected
that
the
transparency
is
accompanied
with
brittleness
and
the
opacity
with
consolidation
i
listened
with
much
compassion
to
this
written
evidence
of
a
perverted
intellect
o
my
friend
what
a
frightful
disorder
is
madness
my
turn
came
next
and
i
repeated
the
fictitious
tale
that
montmorenci
had
taught
me
he
confirmed
it
and
on
being
asked
to
relate
his
own
life
gave
us
with
great
taste
such
a
natural
narrative
of
a
man
living
on
his
wits
that
any
one
who
knew
not
his
noble
origin
must
have
believed
it
soon
afterwards
he
retired
to
dress
for
the
theatre
and
when
he
returned
i
beheld
a
perfect
hero
he
was
habited
in
an
italian
costume
his
hair
hung
in
ringlets
and
mustachios
embellished
his
lip
he
then
departed
in
a
coach
and
as
soon
as
he
had
left
us
declare
said
the
landlady
to
me
do
not
like
your
style
of
beauty
at
all
particularly
his
pencilled
eyebrows
and
curled
locks
they
look
so
womanish
said
i
admire
hesperian
hyacinthine
clustering
curls
surely
you
would
not
have
a
hero
with
overhanging
brows
and
lank
hair
these
are
worn
by
none
but
the
villains
and
assassins
i
perceived
poor
higginson
colouring
and
twisting
his
fingers
and
i
then
recollected
that
his
brows
and
hair
have
precisely
the
faults
which
i
reprobated
dear
dear
muttered
he
and
made
a
precipitate
retreat
from
the
room
i
retired
soon
after
and
i
now
hasten
to
throw
myself
on
my
bed
dream
of
love
and
montmorenci
and
wake
unrefreshed
from
short
and
distracted
slumbers
adieu
letter
xi
this
morning
soon
after
breakfast
i
heard
a
gentle
knocking
at
my
door
and
to
my
great
astonishment
a
figure
cased
in
shining
armour
entered
oh
ye
conscious
blushes
it
was
my
montmorenci
a
plume
of
white
feathers
nodded
on
his
helmet
and
neither
spear
nor
shield
were
wanting
come
cried
he
bending
on
one
knee
and
pressing
my
hand
to
his
lips
come
in
the
ancient
armour
of
my
family
to
perform
my
promise
of
recounting
to
you
the
melancholy
memoirs
of
my
life
lord
said
i
and
be
seated
cherubina
knows
how
to
appreciate
the
honour
that
montmorenci
confers
he
bowed
and
having
laid
by
his
spear
shield
and
helmet
he
placed
himself
beside
me
on
the
sofa
and
began
his
history
was
dark
the
hurricane
howled
the
hail
rattled
and
the
thunder
rolled
nature
was
convulsed
and
the
traveller
inconvenienced
the
province
of
languedoc
stood
the
gothic
castle
of
montmorenci
before
it
ran
the
garonne
and
behind
it
rose
the
pyrenees
whose
summits
exhibiting
awful
forms
seen
and
lost
again
as
the
partial
vapours
rolled
along
were
sometimes
barren
and
gleamed
through
the
blue
tinge
of
air
and
sometimes
frowned
with
forests
of
gloomy
fir
that
swept
downward
to
their
base
lads
are
your
carbines
charged
and
your
daggers
sharpened
whispered
rinaldo
with
his
plume
of
black
feathers
to
the
banditti
in
their
long
cloaks
they
a
said
bernardo
jago
we
might
load
our
carbines
with
the
hail
and
sharpen
our
daggers
against
this
confounded
wind
is
said
ugo
this
moment
the
bell
of
montmorenci
castle
tolled
one
the
sound
vibrated
through
the
long
corridors
the
spiral
staircases
the
suites
of
tapestried
apartments
and
the
ears
of
the
personage
who
has
the
honour
to
address
you
much
alarmed
i
started
from
my
couch
which
was
of
exquisite
workmanship
the
coverlet
of
flowered
gold
and
the
canopy
of
white
velvet
painted
over
with
jonquils
and
butterflies
by
michael
angelo
but
conceive
my
horror
when
i
beheld
my
chamber
filled
with
banditti
my
sword
i
flew
to
a
corner
where
my
coat
of
mail
lay
heapt
the
bravos
rushed
upon
me
but
i
fought
and
dressed
and
dressed
and
fought
till
i
had
perfectly
completed
my
unpleasing
toilette
then
stood
alone
firm
dignified
collected
and
only
fifteen
years
of
age
alack
there
lies
more
peril
in
thine
eye
than
twenty
of
their
describe
the
horror
of
the
contest
that
followed
were
beyond
the
pen
of
an
anacreon
in
short
i
fought
till
my
silver
skin
was
laced
with
my
golden
blood
while
the
bullets
flew
round
me
thick
as
hail
and
whistled
as
they
went
for
want
of
thought
length
my
sword
broke
so
i
set
sail
for
england
i
first
touched
foot
on
her
chalky
beach
hail
exclaimed
i
happy
land
thrice
hail
take
to
thy
fostering
bosom
the
destitute
montmorenci
montmorenci
once
the
first
and
richest
of
the
gallic
nobility
montmorenci
whom
wretches
drove
from
his
hereditary
territories
for
loyalty
to
his
monarch
and
opposition
to
the
atrocities
of
exterminators
and
revolutionists
days
and
nights
i
wandered
through
the
country
the
rivulet
my
beverage
and
the
berry
my
repast
the
turf
my
couch
and
the
sky
my
canopy
interrupted
i
much
you
must
have
missed
the
canopy
of
white
velvet
painted
over
with
jonquils
and
butterflies
said
he
during
sixteen
long
years
i
had
not
a
roof
over
my
i
was
an
itinerant
beggar
summer
day
the
cattle
lay
panting
under
the
broad
umbrage
the
sun
had
burst
into
an
immoderate
fit
of
splendour
and
the
struggling
brook
chided
the
matted
grass
for
obstructing
it
i
sat
under
a
hedge
and
began
eating
wild
strawberries
when
lo
a
form
flexile
as
the
flame
ascending
from
a
censer
and
undulating
with
the
sighs
of
a
dying
vestal
flitted
inaudible
by
me
nor
crushed
the
daisies
as
it
trod
what
a
divinity
she
was
fresh
as
the
anadyomene
of
apelles
and
beautiful
as
the
gnidus
of
praxitiles
or
the
helen
of
zeuxis
her
eyes
dipt
in
heaven
own
hue
said
i
need
not
mind
her
eyes
i
dare
say
they
were
blue
enough
but
pray
who
was
this
immortal
doll
of
your
cried
he
who
but
shall
i
speak
it
who
but
the
lady
cherubina
de
willoughby
montmorenci
cherubina
i
followed
you
with
cautious
steps
continued
he
i
traced
you
into
your
you
had
a
garden
had
you
not
your
garden
i
thought
ten
thousand
flowerets
would
have
leapt
from
their
beds
to
offer
you
a
nosegay
but
the
age
of
gallantry
is
past
that
of
merchants
placemen
and
has
succeeded
and
the
glory
of
cupid
is
extinguished
for
ever
disappeared
i
uttered
incoherent
sentences
and
next
morning
resumed
my
station
at
a
corner
of
the
garden
which
corner
asked
i
really
said
he
can
not
explain
for
the
place
was
then
new
to
me
and
the
ground
was
covered
with
snow
snow
cried
i
i
thought
you
were
eating
wild
strawberries
only
the
day
before
said
he
you
mistake
declare
most
solemnly
you
told
me
so
cried
i
then
said
he
me
if
i
did
said
i
must
remark
that
your
manners
me
cried
he
i
did
say
so
sure
enough
and
i
did
eat
wild
strawberries
too
but
they
were
wild
strawberries
i
had
got
a
small
crock
of
them
from
an
oyster
woman
who
was
opening
oysters
in
a
meadow
for
a
hysterical
butcher
and
her
knife
having
snapt
in
two
i
lent
her
my
sword
so
out
of
gratitude
she
made
me
a
present
of
the
preserves
by
the
bye
they
were
mouldy
morning
as
i
sat
at
the
side
of
the
road
asking
alms
some
provincial
players
passed
by
me
i
accosted
them
and
offered
my
services
in
short
they
took
me
with
them
i
performed
was
applauded
and
at
length
my
fame
reached
london
where
i
have
now
been
acting
some
years
with
much
success
anxious
as
i
am
to
realize
a
little
money
that
i
may
return
in
disguise
to
my
native
country
and
petition
napoleon
to
restore
my
forfeited
estates
fair
lady
such
is
my
round
unvarnished
tale
wherefore
cried
he
starting
from
his
seat
talk
of
the
past
oh
let
me
tell
you
of
the
present
and
of
the
future
oh
let
me
tell
you
how
dearly
how
devotedly
i
love
you
me
cried
i
giving
such
a
start
as
the
nature
of
the
case
required
lord
this
is
so
really
now
so
this
abrupt
avowal
of
my
unhappy
passion
said
he
flinging
himself
at
my
feet
would
i
have
let
concealment
like
a
worm
in
the
bud
feed
on
my
damask
cheek
but
oh
who
could
resist
the
maddening
sight
of
so
much
beauty
i
remained
silent
and
with
the
elegant
embarrassment
of
modesty
cast
my
blue
eyes
to
the
ground
i
never
looked
so
lovely
i
go
cried
he
springing
on
his
feet
fly
from
you
for
ever
no
more
shall
cherubina
be
persecuted
with
my
hopeless
love
but
cherubina
the
hills
and
the
vallies
shall
echo
and
the
songsters
of
the
grove
shall
articulate
cherubina
i
will
shake
the
leaves
of
the
forest
with
my
sighs
and
make
the
stream
so
briny
with
my
tears
that
the
turbot
shall
swim
into
it
and
the
grow
upon
its
banks
do
not
said
i
with
a
look
of
unutterable
anguish
will
exclaimed
he
pacing
the
chamber
with
long
strides
and
slapping
his
heart
i
call
all
the
stars
of
respectability
to
witness
the
vow
then
lady
cherubina
continued
he
stopping
short
before
me
when
maddened
and
emaciated
i
shall
pillow
my
haggard
head
on
a
hard
rock
and
lulled
by
the
hurricanes
of
heaven
shall
sink
into
the
sleep
of
the
grave
montmorenci
said
i
quite
overcome
for
my
sake
as
you
value
my
friendship
live
echoed
he
cherubina
oh
my
soul
precious
treasure
say
not
that
icy
word
say
hatred
disgust
horror
any
thing
but
friendship
shall
i
say
cried
i
ineffably
affected
what
shall
i
do
you
please
muttered
he
looking
wild
and
pressing
his
forehead
brain
is
on
fire
hark
chains
are
clanking
the
furies
are
whipping
me
with
their
serpents
what
smiling
cherub
arrests
yon
bloody
hand
ha
is
cherubina
and
now
she
frowns
at
me
she
darts
at
me
she
pierces
my
heart
with
an
arrow
of
ice
he
threw
himself
on
the
floor
groaned
grievously
and
tore
his
hair
i
was
declare
said
i
would
say
any
thing
on
earth
to
relieve
you
only
tell
me
what
of
light
exclaimed
he
springing
upon
his
feet
and
beaming
on
me
a
smile
that
might
liquefy
marble
i
then
hope
dare
i
say
it
dare
i
pronounce
the
divine
words
she
loves
me
am
thine
and
thou
art
mine
murmured
i
while
the
room
swam
before
me
he
took
both
my
hands
in
his
own
pressed
them
to
his
forehead
and
lips
and
leaned
his
burning
cheek
upon
them
sight
is
confused
said
he
breathing
is
opprest
i
hear
nothing
my
veins
swell
a
palpitation
seizes
my
heart
and
i
scarcely
know
where
i
am
or
whether
i
exist
then
softly
encircling
my
waist
with
his
arm
he
pressed
me
to
his
heart
with
what
modesty
i
tried
to
extricate
myself
from
his
embrace
yet
with
what
willing
weakness
i
trembled
on
his
bosom
it
was
cherubina
hand
that
fell
on
his
shoulder
it
was
cherubina
tress
that
played
on
his
cheek
it
was
cherubina
sigh
that
breathed
on
his
lip
of
a
pure
and
exquisite
emotion
cried
he
the
life
of
man
you
are
known
but
once
yet
once
known
can
you
ever
be
forgotten
now
to
die
would
be
to
die
most
blest
suddenly
he
caught
me
under
the
chin
and
kissed
me
i
struggled
from
him
and
sprang
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
while
my
neck
and
face
were
suffused
with
a
glow
of
indignation
said
i
panting
with
passion
is
so
unprovoked
so
presuming
he
cast
himself
at
my
feet
execrated
his
folly
and
swore
that
he
had
merely
fulfilled
an
etiquette
indispensible
among
lovers
in
his
own
country
not
usual
here
my
lord
said
i
i
have
no
notion
of
submitting
to
any
freedom
that
is
not
sanctioned
by
the
precedent
of
those
exalted
models
whom
i
have
the
honour
to
imitate
fancy
my
lord
you
will
find
that
as
far
as
a
kiss
on
the
hand
or
an
arm
round
the
waist
they
have
no
particular
objection
but
a
salute
on
the
lip
is
considered
inaccurate
my
lord
on
condition
that
you
never
repeat
the
liberty
here
is
my
hand
he
snatched
it
with
ardor
and
strained
it
to
his
throbbing
bosom
now
cried
he
my
happiness
complete
by
making
this
hand
mine
for
ever
on
a
sudden
an
air
of
dignified
grandeur
involved
my
form
my
mind
for
the
first
time
was
called
upon
to
reveal
its
full
force
it
felt
the
solemnity
of
the
appeal
and
triumphed
in
its
conscious
ability
cried
i
thou
not
the
fatal
the
inscrutable
the
mysterious
destiny
which
must
ever
prevent
our
union
i
conjure
you
cried
he
i
expire
on
the
spot
exclaimed
i
thou
suppose
the
poor
orphan
cherubina
so
destitute
of
principle
and
of
pride
as
to
intrude
herself
unknown
unowned
unfriended
mysterious
in
her
birth
and
degraded
in
her
situation
on
the
ancient
and
illustrious
house
of
montmorenci
then
i
most
solemnly
vow
never
to
wed
till
the
horrible
mystery
which
hangs
over
my
birth
be
developed
you
know
biddy
that
a
heroine
ought
always
to
snatch
at
an
opportunity
of
making
a
fatal
vow
when
things
are
going
on
too
smooth
and
interest
drooping
a
fatal
vow
does
wonders
i
remember
reading
in
some
romance
of
a
lady
who
having
vowed
never
to
divulge
a
certain
secret
kept
it
twenty
years
and
with
such
inviolability
that
she
lived
to
see
it
the
death
of
all
her
children
several
of
her
friends
and
a
fine
old
aunt
as
soon
as
i
had
made
this
fatal
vow
his
lordship
fell
into
the
most
afflicting
agonies
and
attitudes
cried
he
be
by
your
side
to
see
you
touch
you
talk
to
you
love
you
adore
you
and
yet
find
you
lost
to
me
for
ever
oh
is
too
much
too
much
milliner
is
here
miss
said
the
maid
tapping
at
the
door
her
call
again
said
i
of
my
soul
murmured
his
lordship
interrupted
the
maid
opening
the
door
can
not
call
again
as
she
must
go
from
this
to
kensington
let
her
come
in
said
i
and
she
entered
with
a
charming
assortment
of
bonnets
and
dresses
will
finish
the
scene
another
time
whispered
i
to
his
lordship
his
lordship
swore
that
he
would
drop
dead
that
instant
the
milliner
declared
that
she
had
brought
me
the
newest
patterns
my
honour
said
i
to
his
lordship
shall
finish
this
scene
morning
if
you
wish
it
may
go
and
be
heigho
said
he
suddenly
checking
himself
what
he
was
about
to
say
i
know
not
something
mysterious
i
should
think
by
the
knitting
of
his
brows
however
he
snatched
his
spear
shield
and
helmet
made
a
low
bow
laid
his
hand
on
his
heart
and
stalked
out
of
the
chamber
interesting
youth
i
then
ran
in
debt
for
some
millinery
drank
hartshorn
and
chafed
my
temples
i
think
i
was
right
about
the
kiss
i
confess
i
am
not
one
of
those
girls
who
try
to
attract
men
through
the
medium
of
the
touch
and
who
thus
excite
passion
at
the
expence
of
respect
lips
are
better
employed
in
sentiment
than
in
kissing
indeed
had
i
not
been
fortified
by
the
precedent
of
other
heroines
i
should
have
felt
and
i
fear
did
actually
feel
even
the
classical
embrace
of
montmorenci
too
great
a
freedom
but
remember
i
am
still
in
my
noviciate
after
a
little
practice
i
shall
probably
think
it
rather
a
pleasure
to
be
strained
and
prest
and
folded
to
the
heart
yet
of
this
i
am
certain
that
i
shall
never
attain
sufficient
hardihood
to
ravish
a
kiss
from
a
mouth
as
the
divine
heloise
did
who
once
ran
at
preux
and
astonished
him
with
the
most
balmy
and
remarkable
kiss
upon
record
poor
fellow
he
was
never
the
same
after
it
i
must
say
too
that
montmorenci
did
not
shew
much
judgment
in
urging
me
to
marry
him
before
i
had
undergone
adventures
for
four
volumes
because
though
the
heroic
etiquette
allowed
me
to
fall
in
love
at
first
sight
and
confess
it
at
second
sight
yet
it
would
not
authorize
me
to
marry
myself
off
quite
so
smoothly
a
heroine
is
never
to
be
got
without
agony
and
adventure
even
the
ground
must
be
lacerated
before
it
will
bring
forth
fruits
and
often
we
can
not
reach
the
lovely
violet
till
we
have
torn
our
hands
with
brambles
i
did
not
see
his
lordship
again
until
dinner
time
and
we
had
almost
finished
our
repast
before
the
poet
made
his
appearance
and
his
bow
his
bow
was
as
usual
but
his
appearance
was
strangely
changed
his
hair
stood
in
stiff
ringlets
on
his
forehead
and
he
had
pruned
his
bushy
eyebrows
till
hardly
one
bristle
remained
while
a
pair
of
white
gloves
small
enough
for
myself
were
forced
upon
his
hands
he
glanced
at
us
with
a
conscious
eye
and
hurried
to
his
seat
at
table
metamorphoses
by
jupiter
exclaimed
montmorenci
higginson
how
shameful
for
the
mice
to
have
nibbled
your
eyebrows
while
apollo
belvidere
was
curling
your
hair
the
poet
blushed
and
ate
with
great
assiduity
dear
fellow
continued
his
lordship
can
dispense
with
those
gloves
during
dinner
tell
me
are
they
mamma
dear
mamma
will
tell
my
mother
of
you
cried
the
poet
half
rising
from
his
chair
now
his
mother
is
an
old
lady
in
one
of
the
garrets
i
then
interfered
in
his
behalf
and
peace
was
restored
after
dinner
i
took
an
opportunity
when
the
landlady
had
left
the
room
to
request
ten
pounds
from
his
lordship
for
the
purpose
of
paying
the
milliner
never
was
regret
so
finely
pictured
in
a
face
as
in
his
while
he
swore
that
he
had
not
a
penny
upon
earth
indeed
so
graceful
was
his
lamentation
so
interesting
his
penury
that
though
the
poet
stole
out
of
the
room
for
ten
pounds
which
he
slipped
into
my
hand
i
preferred
the
refusal
of
the
one
to
the
donation
of
the
other
yes
this
amiable
young
nobleman
increases
in
my
estimation
every
moment
never
can
you
catch
him
out
of
a
picturesque
position
he
would
exhaust
in
an
hour
all
the
attitudes
of
all
the
statues
when
he
talks
tenderness
his
eyes
glow
with
a
moist
fire
and
he
always
brings
in
his
heart
with
peculiar
happiness
then
too
his
oaths
are
at
once
well
conceived
and
elegantly
expressed
thunderbolts
and
the
fixed
stars
are
ever
at
his
elbow
and
no
man
can
sink
himself
to
perdition
with
so
fine
a
grace
but
i
could
write
of
him
talk
of
him
think
of
him
hour
after
hour
minute
after
minute
even
now
while
the
shadows
of
night
are
blackening
the
blushes
of
the
rose
till
dawn
shall
stain
with
her
ruddy
fire
the
snows
of
the
naked
apennine
till
the
dusky
streams
shall
be
pierced
with
darts
of
light
and
the
sun
shall
quaff
his
dewy
beverage
from
the
cup
of
the
tulip
and
the
chalice
of
the
lily
that
is
pretty
painting
adieu
letter
xii
is
my
lady
o
it
is
my
love
exclaimed
lord
altamont
mortimer
montmorenci
as
he
flew
like
a
winged
mercury
into
my
apartment
this
morning
a
loud
rap
at
the
door
checked
his
eloquence
and
spoiled
a
most
promising
posture
miss
wilkinson
within
said
a
voice
in
the
hall
such
person
lives
here
replied
the
maid
who
was
accustomed
to
hear
me
called
miss
donald
there
does
and
on
the
too
and
i
will
find
her
out
i
warrant
cried
the
same
voice
my
door
was
then
thrown
open
and
who
should
waddle
into
the
room
but
fat
wilkinson
my
first
feeling
could
you
believe
it
was
of
gladness
at
seeing
him
nor
had
i
presence
of
mind
enough
either
to
repulse
his
embrace
or
utter
a
piercing
shriek
happily
my
recollection
soon
returned
and
i
flung
him
from
me
said
he
cherry
what
have
i
done
to
you
that
you
should
use
me
thus
was
there
ever
a
wish
of
your
heart
that
i
left
ungratified
and
now
to
desert
me
in
my
old
age
only
come
home
with
me
my
child
only
come
home
with
me
and
i
will
forgive
you
all
said
i
interview
must
be
short
pointed
and
decisive
as
to
calling
yourself
my
father
that
is
a
stale
trick
and
will
not
pass
and
as
to
personating
what
i
perceive
you
aspire
to
the
grand
villain
of
my
plot
your
corpulency
pardon
me
puts
that
out
of
the
question
for
ever
i
should
be
just
as
happy
to
employ
you
as
any
other
man
i
know
but
excuse
me
if
i
say
that
you
rather
overrate
your
talents
and
qualifications
have
you
the
gaunt
ferocity
of
famine
in
your
countenance
can
you
darken
the
midnight
of
a
scowl
have
you
the
quivering
lip
and
the
schedoniac
contour
and
while
the
lower
part
of
your
face
is
hidden
in
black
drapery
can
your
eyes
glare
from
under
the
edge
of
a
cowl
in
a
word
are
you
a
picturesque
villain
full
of
plot
and
horror
and
magnificent
wickedness
ah
no
sir
you
are
only
a
sleek
gentleman
continue
then
what
nature
made
you
return
to
your
plough
mow
reap
fatten
your
pigs
and
the
parson
but
never
again
attempt
to
get
yourself
thrust
into
the
pages
of
a
romance
disappointment
and
dismay
forced
more
meaning
into
his
features
than
i
thought
them
possessed
of
the
fact
is
he
had
never
imagined
that
my
notions
of
what
villains
ought
to
be
were
so
refined
and
that
i
have
formed
my
taste
in
these
matters
upon
the
purest
models
as
a
last
effort
of
despair
the
silly
man
flung
himself
on
his
knees
before
me
and
grasping
my
hands
looked
up
in
my
face
with
such
an
imploring
wretchedness
of
expression
while
the
tears
rolled
silently
down
his
cheeks
that
i
confess
i
was
a
little
moved
and
for
the
moment
fancied
him
sincere
goodness
bless
thee
said
he
at
length
bless
thee
for
those
sweet
tears
of
thine
my
daughter
cried
i
quite
shocked
darling
said
he
now
with
this
kiss
of
peace
and
love
we
will
blot
out
all
the
past
i
shrieked
started
from
my
seat
and
rushed
into
the
expanding
arms
of
montmorenci
pray
sir
cried
wilkinson
advancing
fiercely
are
you
lodger
in
this
house
sir
answered
his
lordship
your
best
friend
as
i
trust
you
will
acknowledge
hereafter
i
became
acquainted
with
this
lady
at
the
table
of
our
hostess
and
learned
from
her
that
she
had
left
your
house
in
disgust
yesterday
morning
on
entering
her
apartment
to
make
my
respects
i
found
an
old
gentleman
there
one
doctor
merrick
whom
i
recognized
as
a
wretch
of
infamous
character
tried
twice
for
shoplifting
and
once
for
having
swindled
the
spanish
ambassador
out
of
a
golden
i
though
an
humble
individual
yet
being
well
acquainted
with
this
young
lady
high
respectability
presumed
to
warn
her
against
such
a
dangerous
companion
when
i
found
to
my
great
concern
that
she
had
already
promised
him
her
hand
in
marriage
wilkinson
groaned
i
stared
being
apprised
of
his
character
continued
montmorenci
young
lady
was
willing
enough
to
drop
the
connection
but
unfortunately
the
ruffian
had
previously
procured
a
written
promise
of
marriage
from
her
which
he
now
refuses
to
surrender
and
at
the
moment
you
came
i
was
consulting
with
your
daughter
what
was
best
to
be
done
me
to
him
cried
wilkinson
me
to
the
villain
this
instant
and
i
will
shew
you
what
is
best
to
be
done
have
appointed
an
interview
with
him
about
this
time
said
his
lordship
as
your
feelings
might
probably
prompt
you
to
too
much
warmth
perhaps
you
had
better
not
accompany
me
but
should
i
fail
in
persuading
him
to
deliver
up
the
fatal
paper
you
shall
then
see
him
yourself
are
a
fine
fellow
cried
the
farmer
shaking
his
hand
have
bound
me
to
you
for
ever
will
hasten
to
him
now
said
his
lordship
and
casting
a
significant
glance
at
me
departed
leaving
me
quite
astonished
both
at
his
story
and
his
motive
for
fabricating
it
it
was
however
my
business
to
support
the
deception
wilkinson
then
told
me
that
he
discovered
my
place
of
residence
in
london
from
the
discharged
butler
who
it
seems
is
not
your
son
but
your
lover
and
to
whom
you
have
shewn
all
my
letters
he
went
to
wilkinson
and
made
the
disclosure
for
forty
guineas
sordid
wretch
and
wilkinson
says
that
he
wants
to
marry
you
merely
for
the
sake
of
your
annuity
biddy
biddy
had
you
known
as
much
of
the
world
as
i
do
now
a
fortune
hunter
would
not
have
imposed
upon
you
as
to
your
shewing
him
my
letters
i
can
not
well
blame
you
for
a
breach
of
trust
which
has
answered
the
purpose
of
involving
my
life
in
a
more
complicated
labyrinth
of
entanglements
but
to
return
in
the
midst
of
our
conversation
the
maid
brought
me
a
note
it
was
from
montmorenci
and
as
follows
my
soul
idol
forgive
the
tale
i
told
wilkinson
since
it
was
devised
in
order
to
save
her
from
his
fangs
this
doctor
merrick
whom
i
mentioned
to
him
instead
of
being
a
swindler
is
a
and
keeps
a
private
madhouse
i
have
just
seen
him
and
have
informed
him
that
i
am
about
to
put
a
lunatic
gentleman
my
honoured
uncle
under
his
care
i
told
him
that
this
dear
uncle
who
you
may
well
suppose
is
wilkinson
has
lucid
intervals
that
his
madness
arose
from
grief
at
an
unfortunate
amour
of
his
daughter
and
shews
itself
in
his
fancying
that
every
man
he
sees
wants
to
marry
her
and
has
her
written
promise
of
marriage
have
already
advanced
the
necessary
fees
and
now
is
your
time
to
wheedle
wilkinson
out
of
money
by
pretending
that
you
will
return
home
with
him
a
true
heroine
my
sweet
friend
ever
shines
in
deception
good
now
play
one
scene
of
excellent
shakespeare
ever
ever
faithful
excuse
tender
language
as
i
am
in
haste
this
dear
letter
i
placed
in
my
bosom
and
when
i
begged
of
the
farmer
to
let
me
have
a
little
money
he
took
out
his
my
darling
said
he
are
notes
to
the
tune
of
a
hundred
pounds
that
you
may
pay
all
you
owe
and
purchase
whatever
baubles
and
finery
you
like
this
is
what
you
get
for
discarding
that
swindler
and
promising
to
return
home
with
old
dad
soon
afterwards
our
hero
came
back
and
told
us
that
his
interview
had
proved
unsuccessful
it
was
therefore
determined
that
we
should
all
repair
to
the
doctor
for
wilkinson
would
not
go
without
me
and
off
we
set
in
a
hired
coach
on
our
arrival
we
were
shewn
into
a
parlour
and
after
some
minutes
of
anxious
suspense
the
doctor
a
thin
little
figure
with
a
shrivelled
face
and
bushy
wig
came
humming
into
the
room
wilkinson
being
introduced
the
doctor
commenced
operations
by
trying
the
state
of
his
brain
news
mr
wilkinson
said
he
bad
news
for
me
sir
replied
wilkinson
sullenly
mean
public
news
said
the
doctor
private
grievance
ought
to
be
considered
of
public
moment
said
wilkinson
remarked
sir
cried
the
doctor
observation
as
possible
sir
i
give
you
credit
there
is
a
neatness
in
the
turn
of
it
that
argues
a
collected
intellect
said
wilkinson
hope
that
some
other
observations
which
i
am
about
to
offer
will
please
you
as
well
hope
so
for
your
own
sake
answered
the
doctor
shall
certainly
listen
to
them
with
a
favourable
ear
you
sir
said
the
farmer
such
being
the
case
i
make
no
doubt
that
all
will
go
well
for
men
seldom
disagree
when
they
wish
to
coincide
again
cried
the
doctor
and
good
sir
if
you
continue
to
talk
so
rationally
i
promise
you
that
you
will
not
remain
long
in
my
house
am
sorry
replied
wilkinson
talking
rationally
is
the
way
to
get
turned
out
of
your
house
because
i
have
come
for
the
purpose
of
talking
rationally
while
such
is
your
resolution
said
the
doctor
shall
be
left
undone
to
make
my
house
agreeable
you
have
only
to
hint
your
wishes
and
they
shall
be
gratified
sir
cried
wilkinson
grasping
his
hand
kindness
is
overpowering
because
it
is
unexpected
however
i
do
not
mean
to
trespass
any
farther
on
your
kindness
than
just
to
request
that
you
will
do
me
the
favour
of
returning
to
my
daughter
the
silly
paper
written
by
her
containing
her
promise
to
marry
you
and
if
you
could
conveniently
lay
your
hand
on
it
now
you
would
add
to
the
obligation
as
i
mean
to
leave
town
in
an
hour
wilkinson
said
the
doctor
shall
deal
candidly
with
you
probably
you
will
not
leave
town
these
ten
years
and
pardon
me
if
i
give
you
fair
warning
that
should
you
persist
in
asking
for
the
paper
a
severe
will
be
the
consequence
repeated
wilkinson
as
if
he
could
not
believe
his
ears
shall
be
cut
from
shoulder
to
flank
said
the
doctor
my
usual
way
of
beginning
thing
more
my
fine
fellow
cried
the
farmer
that
if
you
continue
refractory
said
the
doctor
shall
be
lashed
to
the
and
shall
live
on
bread
and
water
for
a
month
is
a
proper
ruffian
for
you
cried
wilkinson
by
the
mother
that
bore
me
i
have
a
good
mind
to
flay
you
within
an
inch
of
your
life
haste
then
said
the
doctor
ringing
the
bell
you
will
be
handcuffed
in
half
a
minute
you
little
creature
cried
wilkinson
you
hope
to
frighten
me
not
ask
for
the
paper
truly
ay
ten
thousand
times
over
and
over
give
me
the
paper
give
me
the
paper
give
me
the
paper
the
paper
the
paper
what
say
you
to
that
old
hector
handcuffs
cried
the
doctor
to
the
servant
first
handcuff
me
and
then
pick
my
pockets
cried
wilkinson
see
i
have
found
you
out
sirrah
yes
i
have
discovered
that
you
are
a
common
shoplifter
tried
five
times
for
your
life
and
the
very
fellow
that
swindled
the
spanish
ambassador
out
of
a
diamond
good
deal
deranged
indeed
whispered
the
doctor
to
his
lordship
how
the
deuce
the
girl
could
bring
herself
to
fancy
you
cried
wilkinson
is
what
shocks
me
most
a
fellow
by
all
that
is
horrid
as
ugly
as
if
he
were
bespoke
an
old
fellow
too
and
twice
as
disgusting
and
not
half
so
interesting
as
a
monkey
in
a
consumption
distracted
my
conscience
muttered
the
doctor
maddest
scoundrel
confound
him
that
ever
bellowed
in
bedlam
two
servants
entered
with
handcuffs
you
cried
wilkinson
shaking
his
cane
to
bring
your
bullies
here
and
if
i
do
cudgel
their
carcases
out
of
shape
and
your
into
shape
may
i
be
shot
his
hands
said
the
doctor
wilkinson
instantly
darted
at
the
doctor
and
knocked
him
down
the
servants
collared
wilkinson
who
called
to
montmorenci
for
assistance
but
in
vain
and
after
a
furious
scuffle
the
farmer
was
handcuffed
uncle
calm
these
transports
said
his
lordship
dutiful
and
affectionate
nephew
beseeches
you
to
compose
yourself
nephew
cried
the
farmer
do
you
mean
fellow
who
the
devil
is
this
villain
you
so
far
gone
as
not
to
know
your
own
nephew
said
the
doctor
grinning
with
anger
set
eyes
on
the
poltron
till
an
hour
ago
cried
wilkinson
powers
exclaimed
montmorenci
when
i
was
a
baby
he
dandled
me
and
when
i
was
a
child
he
gave
me
whippings
and
and
when
i
came
to
man
estate
he
cherished
me
in
his
bosom
and
was
unto
me
as
a
father
here
his
lordship
applied
a
handkerchief
to
his
face
man
is
crazed
cried
wilkinson
dear
uncle
said
montmorenci
you
who
are
crazed
and
to
be
candid
with
you
this
is
a
madhouse
and
this
gentleman
is
the
and
with
him
you
must
now
remain
till

sinful
soul

montmorenci
hastily

said
i
poor
wilkinson
leaving

cried
he
your
old
father
a
prisoner
in
this
vile
house
oh
cruel

said
montmorenci
taking
my
hand
have
particular
business
elsewhere
pity
sake
stay
five
minutes
cried
wilkinson
struggling
with
the
servants
my
love
said
montmorenci
one
minute
one
short
minute
cried
the
other
said
i
stopping
minute
then
one
moment
cried
his
lordship
and
was
hurrying
me
away
child
my
child
cried
wilkinson
with
a
tone
of
such
indescribable
agony
as
made
the
blood
curdle
in
my
veins
sir
said
i
returning
i
am
your
friend
but
you
know
you
know
well
i
am
not
your
child
are
cried
he
all
that
is
just
and
good
you
are
my
own
child
all
that
is
just
and
good
exclaimed
montmorenci
shall
come
away
this
instant
or
remain
here
for
ever
and
he
dragged
me
out
of
the
room
then
said
the
poor
prisoner
as
the
door
was
closing
do
what
you
please
with
me
for
my
heart
is
quite
broken
on
our
way
home
his
lordship
enjoined
the
strictest
secrecy
with
regard
to
this
adventure
i
shewed
him
the
hundred
pounds
and
reimbursed
him
for
what
he
had
paid
the
doctor
and
on
our
arrival
i
discharged
my
debt
to
the
poet
adieu
letter
xiii
soon
after
i
had
got
into
these
lodgings
i
sent
the
servant
to
grosvenor
square
with
a
message
for
betterton
requesting
him
to
let
me
have
back
the
bandbox
which
i
left
at
his
house
the
night
i
fled
from
him
in
a
short
time
she
returned
with
it
and
i
found
every
article
safe
to
my
amazement
and
dismay
who
should
enter
my
apartment
this
morning
but
betterton
himself
i
dropped
my
book
he
bowed
to
the
dust
business
sir
said
i
rising
with
a
dignity
which
from
my
being
under
the
repeated
necessity
of
assuming
it
has
now
become
natural
to
me
make
a
personal
apology
replied
he
the
disrespectful
and
inhospitable
treatment
which
the
loveliest
of
her
sex
experienced
at
my
house
apology
for
one
insult
said
i
seem
insincere
when
the
mode
adopted
for
making
it
is
another
insult
retort
is
exquisitely
elegant
answered
he
i
trust
not
true
for
granting
my
dear
madam
that
i
offer
a
second
insult
by
my
intrusion
still
i
may
lessen
the
first
insult
so
much
by
my
apology
that
the
sum
of
both
may
be
less
than
the
first
as
it
originally
stood
said
i
have
blended
politeness
and
arithmetic
so
happily
together
you
have
clothed
multiplication
and
subtraction
in
such
polished
phraseology
cried
he
is
real
wit
have
added
so
much
algebra
to
so
much
sentiment
continued
i
good
interrupted
he
again
short
you
have
apologized
so
gracefully
by
the
rule
of
three
that
i
know
not
which
has
assisted
you
the
most
chesterfield
or
cocker
exclaimed
he
your
retorting
powers
are
superior
to
those
of
any
heroine
on
record
in
short
my
friend
i
was
so
delighted
with
my
repartee
that
i
could
not
for
my
life
continue
vexed
with
the
object
of
it
and
before
he
left
me
i
said
the
best
things
in
nature
found
him
the
most
agreeable
old
man
in
the
world
shook
hands
with
him
at
parting
and
gave
him
permission
to
visit
me
again
on
calm
consideration
i
do
not
disapprove
of
my
having
allowed
him
this
liberty
were
he
merely
a
good
kind
of
good
for
nothing
old
gentleman
it
would
only
be
losing
time
to
cultivate
an
acquaintance
with
him
but
as
the
man
is
a
reprobate
i
may
find
account
in
enlisting
him
amongst
the
other
characters
particularly
since
i
am
at
present
miserably
off
for
villains
indeed
i
augur
auspiciously
of
his
powers
from
the
fact
which
he
confessed
of
his
having
discovered
my
place
of
abode
by
following
the
maid
when
she
was
returning
with
my
bandbox
but
i
have
to
inform
you
of
another
rencontre
last
night
the
landlady
higginson
and
myself
went
to
see
his
lordship
perform
in
the
new
spectacle
the
first
piece
was
called
a
melodrama
a
compound
of
horror
and
drollery
where
scenery
dresses
and
decorations
prevailed
over
nature
genius
and
moral
as
to
the
plot
i
could
make
nothing
of
it
only
that
the
hero
and
heroine
were
in
very
great
trouble
about
trifles
and
quite
at
their
ease
in
real
distress
for
instance
when
the
heroine
had
arrived
at
the
height
of
her
misery
she
began
to
sing
then
the
hero
resolving
to
revenge
her
wrongs
falls
upon
one
knee
turns
up
his
eyes
and
calls
on
the
sacred
majesty
of
god
to
assist
him
this
invocation
to
the
divinity
might
perhaps
prove
the
hero
piety
but
i
am
afraid
it
shewed
the
want
of
any
certainly
however
it
produced
a
powerful
effect
on
my
feelings
i
heard
the
glory
of
god
made
subservient
to
a
theatrical
and
my
blood
ran
cold
so
i
fancy
did
the
blood
of
six
or
seven
sweet
little
children
behind
the
scenes
for
they
were
presently
sent
upon
the
stage
to
warm
themselves
with
a
dance
after
dancing
came
murder
and
the
hero
gracefully
advanced
with
a
bullet
in
his
head
he
falls
and
many
persons
suppose
that
the
curtain
will
fall
with
him
no
such
thing
hector
had
a
funeral
and
so
must
kemble
accordingly
the
corpse
appears
handsomely
dished
up
on
an
escutcheoned
coffin
while
certain
virgins
of
the
sun
who
i
am
told
support
that
character
better
than
their
own
chaunt
a
holy
requiem
round
it
when
horror
was
exhausted
the
poet
tried
disgust
after
this
piece
came
another
full
of
bannered
processions
gilded
pillars
paper
snows
and
living
horses
that
were
really
far
better
actors
than
the
men
who
rode
them
it
concluded
with
a
grand
battle
in
which
twenty
men
on
horseback
and
twenty
on
foot
beat
each
other
indiscriminately
and
with
the
utmost
good
humour
armour
clashed
sabres
struck
fire
a
castle
was
burnt
to
the
ground
horses
fell
dead
the
audience
rose
shouting
and
clapping
and
a
man
just
below
me
in
the
pit
cried
out
in
an
ecstasy
made
their
saddles
i
made
their
saddles
as
to
montmorenci
performance
nothing
could
equal
it
for
though
his
character
was
the
meanest
in
the
piece
he
contrived
to
make
it
the
most
prominent
he
had
an
emphasis
for
every
word
an
attitude
for
every
emphasis
and
a
look
for
every
attitude
the
people
indeed
hissed
him
repeatedly
because
they
knew
not
as
i
did
that
his
acting
a
broken
soldier
in
the
style
of
a
dethroned
monarch
proceeded
from
his
native
nobility
of
soul
not
his
want
of
talent
after
the
performance
we
were
pressing
through
the
crowd
in
the
lobby
when
i
saw
as
i
thought
stuart
bob
stuart
at
a
short
distance
from
me
looking
anxiously
about
him
on
nearer
inspection
i
found
i
was
right
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
extract
a
most
interesting
scene
from
him
besides
laying
a
foundation
for
future
incident
i
therefore
separated
myself
like
evelina
at
the
opera
from
my
party
and
contrived
to
cross
his
path
at
first
he
did
not
recognize
me
but
i
continued
by
his
side
till
he
did
wilkinson
exclaimed
he
rejoiced
i
am
to
see
you
where
is
your
father
us
leave
this
place
said
i
are
searching
for
me
i
know
they
are
said
he
whispered
i
me
in
silence
from
the
theatre
he
put
my
hand
under
his
arm
and
hurried
me
away
when
we
had
gained
the
street
may
perceive
by
my
lameness
said
he
i
am
not
yet
well
of
the
wound
i
received
the
night
i
met
you
on
the
common
but
i
could
not
refrain
from
accompanying
your
father
to
town
in
search
of
you
and
as
i
heard
nothing
of
him
since
he
went
to
your
lodgings
yesterday
i
called
there
myself
this
evening
and
was
told
that
you
had
gone
to
the
theatre
they
could
give
me
no
information
about
your
father
but
of
course
you
have
seen
him
since
he
came
to
town
have
not
i
assure
you
said
i
an
evasive
yet
conscientious
answer
because
wilkinson
is
not
my
real
father
is
most
extraordinary
cried
he
he
left
the
hotel
yesterday
to
call
on
you
but
tell
me
candidly
miss
wilkinson
what
tempted
you
to
leave
home
how
are
you
situated
at
present
with
whom
and
what
is
your
object
said
i
horrible
mystery
hangs
over
me
which
i
dare
not
now
develop
it
is
enough
that
in
flying
from
one
misfortune
i
have
plunged
into
a
thousand
others
that
peace
has
fled
from
my
heart
and
that
i
am
ruined
exclaimed
he
with
a
look
of
horror
redemption
said
i
hiding
my
face
in
my
hands
will
be
dreadful
news
for
your
poor
father
said
he
i
beg
of
you
to
tell
me
the
particulars
to
be
brief
answered
i
first
night
i
came
to
town
a
gentleman
decoyed
me
into
his
house
and
treated
me
extremely
villain
muttered
stuart
i
left
him
continued
i
walked
the
streets
till
i
was
taken
up
for
a
robbery
and
put
into
the
watchhouse
this
fact
asked
stuart
are
you
merely
sporting
with
my
feelings
fact
on
my
honour
said
i
to
conclude
my
short
but
pathetic
tale
a
gentleman
a
mysterious
and
amiable
youth
met
me
by
mere
accident
after
my
release
and
i
am
at
present
under
his
protection
shocking
account
indeed
said
he
have
you
never
considered
the
consequences
of
continuing
this
abandoned
course
of
life
here
is
a
pretty
insinuation
cried
i
such
is
always
the
fate
of
us
poor
heroines
no
never
can
we
get
through
an
innocent
adventure
in
peace
and
quietness
without
having
our
virtue
called
in
question
is
always
our
virtue
our
virtue
if
we
are
caught
coming
out
of
a
young
man
is
our
virtue
if
we
remain
a
whole
night
in
the
streets
is
our
virtue
if
we
make
a
nocturnal
assignation
oh
is
our
virtue
our
virtue
such
a
rout
as
they
make
regret
said
stuart
see
you
treat
the
subject
so
lightly
but
i
do
beseech
of
you
to
recollect
that
your
wretched
parent
a
fine
night
sir
your
wretched
parent
said
i
spleen
takes
the
form
of
remonstrance
a
lecture
is
only
a
scolding
put
into
good
language
this
is
my
house
sir
and
i
stopped
at
the
door
least
said
he
you
do
me
the
favour
of
being
at
home
for
me
morning
i
may
replied
i
good
night
master
bobby
the
poet
and
the
landlady
did
not
return
for
half
an
hour
they
told
me
that
their
delay
was
occasioned
by
their
search
for
me
but
i
refused
all
explanation
as
to
what
happened
after
i
had
lost
them
adieu
letter
xiv
just
as
i
had
finished
my
last
letter
his
lordship
entered
my
room
but
saluted
me
coldly
am
informed
said
he
you
strayed
from
your
party
last
night
and
refused
afterwards
to
give
an
account
of
yourself
to
the
landlady
may
i
hope
that
to
me
who
feel
a
personal
interest
in
all
your
actions
you
will
be
more
communicative
regret
said
i
circumstances
put
it
out
of
my
power
to
gratify
your
wishes
i
foresee
that
you
like
an
orville
or
a
mortimer
will
suspect
and
asperse
your
mistress
but
the
sun
shall
return
the
mist
disperse
and
the
landscape
laugh
again
your
metaphors
he
discarding
attitude
and
elegance
in
an
instant
you
hope
to
hide
your
cunning
under
mists
and
laughing
landscapes
but
i
am
not
to
be
gulled
i
am
not
to
be
done
no
going
it
upon
me
i
say
tell
me
directly
madam
where
you
were
and
with
whom
or
by
the
devil
of
devils
you
shall
repent
it
finely
i
was
thunderstruck
said
i
have
agitated
the
gentle
air
with
the
concussion
of
inelegant
oaths
and
idioms
uttered
in
the
most
ungraceful
manner
sir
your
vulgarity
is
unpardonable
and
we
now
part
for
ever
ever
exclaimed
he
reverting
into
attitude
and
interlacing
his
knuckles
in
a
clasp
of
agony
me
cherubina
by
the
shades
of
my
ancestors
my
vulgarity
was
assumed
sir
said
i
pray
for
what
possible
purpose
cried
he
must
not
dare
not
tell
it
is
a
sad
story
and
enveloped
in
a
mysterious
veil
oh
fatal
vow
oh
cruel
marchesa
shocking
were
his
contortions
as
he
spoke
cried
i
vow
could
ever
have
produced
so
dreadful
an
effect
on
your
language
he
after
a
painful
pause
than
incur
the
odium
of
falsehood
i
must
disclose
to
you
the
horrid
secret
young
count
di
narcissini
was
my
friend
educated
together
we
became
competitors
in
our
studies
and
accomplishments
and
in
none
of
them
could
either
of
us
be
said
to
excel
the
other
till
on
our
introduction
at
court
it
was
remarked
by
the
queen
that
i
surpassed
the
count
in
shaking
hands
said
her
majesty
judgment
enough
in
knowing
when
to
present
a
single
finger
or
perhaps
two
but
for
the
positive
pressure
or
the
negligent
hand
with
a
drooping
wrist
or
the
cordial
honest
dislocating
shake
give
me
montmorenci
i
can
not
deny
that
the
former
has
great
taste
in
this
accomplishment
but
then
the
latter
has
more
genius
more
execution
more
as
it
were
of
the
and
mother
the
marchesa
overheard
this
critique
turned
as
pale
as
ashes
and
left
the
levee
night
hardly
had
i
fallen
into
one
of
those
gentle
slumbers
which
ever
attends
the
virtuous
when
a
sudden
noise
roused
me
and
on
opening
my
eyes
i
beheld
the
detested
marchesa
with
an
italian
assassin
standing
over
me
cried
she
art
the
bane
of
my
repose
thou
hast
surpassed
my
son
in
the
graces
now
listen
either
pledge
thyself
by
an
irrevocable
vow
henceforth
to
sprinkle
thy
conversation
with
uncouth
phrases
and
colloquial
barbarisms
or
prepare
to
die
alternative
what
could
i
do
the
dagger
gleamed
before
my
face
i
shuddered
and
took
the
fatal
vow
of
vulgarity
marchesa
then
put
into
my
hand
the
blackguard
dictionary
which
i
studied
night
and
day
with
much
success
and
i
have
now
the
misfortune
to
state
that
i
can
be
so
far
as
language
goes
the
greatest
blackguard
in
england
youth
cried
i
indeed
accounts
for
what
had
often
made
me
uneasy
but
say
can
nothing
absolve
you
from
this
hateful
vow
is
one
way
he
replied
marchesa
permitted
me
to
resume
my
natural
elegance
as
soon
as
my
marrying
should
put
an
end
to
competition
between
her
son
and
me
oh
then
my
cherubina
you
you
alone
can
restore
me
to
hope
to
happiness
and
to
grammar
my
lord
cried
i
my
own
fatal
vow
never
never
can
i
be
your
me
not
mad
he
cried
are
mine
you
shall
be
mine
this
this
is
the
bitterest
moment
of
my
life
you
do
not
can
not
love
me
no
cherubina
no
you
can
not
love
me
i
fixed
my
eyes
in
a
wild
gaze
rose
hastily
from
my
chair
paced
the
room
with
quick
steps
and
often
sighing
deeply
clasped
my
hands
and
shuddered
he
led
me
to
the
sofa
kissed
the
drapery
of
my
cambric
handkerchief
and
concealed
his
face
in
its
folds
then
raising
his
head
you
love
me
said
he
with
a
voice
dropping
manna
a
smile
bashful
in
its
archness
played
round
my
rich
and
trembling
lip
and
with
an
air
of
bewitching
insinuation
i
placed
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
shook
my
head
and
looked
up
in
his
face
with
an
expression
half
reproachful
half
tender
he
snatched
me
in
a
transport
to
his
heart
and
that
trembling
pressure
which
virtue
consecrated
and
love
understood
conveyed
to
each
of
us
an
unspeakable
sensation
as
if
a
beam
from
heaven
had
passed
through
both
our
frames
and
left
some
of
its
divine
warmth
behind
it
what
followed
angels
might
have
attested
a
ringlet
had
escaped
from
the
bandage
of
my
bodkin
he
clipped
it
off
with
my
scissors
and
fixed
it
next
his
heart
while
i
prettily
struggled
to
prevent
him
with
arch
anger
and
a
pouting
playfulness
a
thousand
saucy
triumphs
were
basking
in
his
eyes
when
the
door
opened
and
who
should
make
his
appearance
but
master
bobby
i
could
have
boxed
him
avail
myself
said
he
the
permission
you
gave
me
last
night
to
call
on
you
this
morning
montmorenci
looked
from
the
one
to
the
other
with
amazement
as
i
am
anxious
continued
stuart
speak
with
you
in
private
said
i
thing
which
you
have
to
communicate
this
gentleman
my
particular
friend
may
hear
sir
cried
his
lordship
in
a
haughty
tone
i
have
the
honour
to
boast
myself
the
protector
of
this
lady
you
mean
her
protector
from
injury
and
insult
said
stuart
hope
sir
you
are
not
on
this
occasion
as
on
others
an
actor
know
me
then
said
his
lordship
saw
you
perform
last
night
answered
stuart
to
say
the
truth
i
do
not
recollect
your
name
name
is
norval
on
the
grampian
hills
cried
his
lordship
said
stuart
we
sometimes
laugh
at
you
even
in
your
grave
characters
the
part
you
have
now
chosen
seems
much
too
serious
for
drollery
allow
me
to
ask
sir
by
what
right
you
feel
entitled
to
call
yourself
the
protector
of
this
lady
inform
me
said
montmorenci
what
right
you
feel
entitled
to
put
that
question
the
right
of
friendship
answered
stuart
but
enmity
cried
i
unprincipled
inexorable
enmity
this
is
the
stuart
whom
you
have
often
heard
me
mention
as
my
persecutor
and
i
hope
you
will
now
make
him
repent
of
his
temerity
said
his
lordship
desire
you
to
leave
the
house
till
you
favour
me
with
your
company
replied
stuart
i
find
i
must
have
some
serious
conversation
with
you
my
heart
cried
lord
altamont
mortimer
montmorenci
you
want
satisfaction
follow
me
this
moment
i
am
none
of
your
slovenly
slobbering
shots
damme
i
scorn
to
pistol
a
gentleman
about
the
ankles
i
can
teach
the
young
idea
how
to
shoot
damme
he
spoke
and
strode
out
of
the
room
stuart
smiled
and
followed
him
you
must
know
i
speculate
upon
a
duel
in
short
my
plot
is
entangling
itself
admirably
and
such
characters
as
betterton
and
stuart
will
not
fail
to
keep
the
wheels
of
it
going
betterton
is
probably
planning
to
carry
me
off
by
force
stuart
and
our
hero
are
coming
to
a
misunderstanding
about
me
the
latter
will
perhaps
return
with
his
arm
in
an
interesting
sling
and
another
interview
can
not
be
far
distant
such
is
the
promising
aspect
of
affairs
adieu
letter
xv
while
i
was
sitting
in
the
most
painful
suspense
a
knock
came
to
the
door
and
stuart
entered
terrify
shock
amaze
me
cried
i
dreadful
blow
awaits
me
speak
said
he
laughing
was
your
fancy
for
telling
me
that
you
were
ruined
so
i
am
answered
i
least
not
in
the
way
you
wished
me
to
suppose
said
he
repeat
sir
cried
i
i
am
ruined
no
matter
in
what
manner
but
ruined
i
am
friend
the
player
tells
me
that
you
are
not
said
he
friend
the
player
is
very
meddling
answered
i
is
the
way
that
whatever
plot
i
lay
down
for
my
memoirs
is
always
frustrated
sir
i
say
i
am
ruined
cried
he
will
not
dispute
the
point
i
wish
only
to
guard
you
against
being
ruined
again
i
mistrust
this
grundy
much
from
his
conversation
after
we
left
you
i
can
perceive
that
he
has
a
matrimonial
design
upon
you
pray
beware
of
the
fellow
fellow
cried
i
you
know
him
not
his
large
and
piercing
eye
is
but
the
index
of
a
soul
fraught
with
every
human
virtue
my
friend
said
he
stand
on
the
very
verge
of
a
precipice
and
i
must
endeavour
even
at
the
risk
of
your
displeasure
to
snatch
you
from
it
he
then
began
a
long
lecture
on
my
conduct
and
asserted
that
my
romantic
turn
is
a
sort
of
infatuation
amounting
to
little
less
than
madness
and
likely
to
terminate
in
ruin
he
painted
in
language
pretty
enough
the
distraction
of
wilkinson
after
i
had
fled
from
his
house
and
at
last
contrived
to
extract
from
me
what
i
remark
i
can
never
obtain
when
i
want
them
tears
seeing
me
thus
affected
he
turned
the
conversation
to
desultory
topics
we
talked
of
old
times
of
our
juvenal
sports
and
quarrels
when
we
were
playfellows
what
happened
after
our
separation
his
life
at
college
and
in
the
army
my
studies
and
accomplishments
thence
we
made
a
natural
transition
to
the
fine
arts
in
short
it
was
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
i
had
a
rational
conversation
as
it
is
called
with
a
young
man
and
i
confess
i
felt
gratified
besides
even
his
serious
remonstrances
were
so
happily
interspersed
with
humour
and
delicate
irony
that
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
be
displeased
with
him
he
remained
more
than
two
hours
and
at
parting
took
my
hand
have
hitherto
been
scolding
you
said
he
with
a
smile
i
must
now
praise
you
that
i
may
be
better
entitled
to
scold
you
again
you
have
the
elements
of
every
thing
amiable
and
endearing
in
your
mind
and
an
admirable
understanding
to
direct
them
but
you
want
some
one
to
direct
that
understanding
your
father
and
i
have
already
had
a
serious
consultation
on
the
subject
but
till
he
comes
nothing
can
be
done
indeed
i
am
much
alarmed
at
his
absence
meantime
will
you
permit
me
to
legislate
in
his
stead
and
to
begin
by
chusing
more
eligible
lodgings
for
you
i
confess
i
dread
the
machinations
of
that
actor
as
he
spoke
a
rap
came
to
the
door
me
the
favour
to
take
tea
with
me
this
evening
said
i
we
will
talk
the
matter
over
he
promised
and
took
his
leave
montmorenci
then
made
his
appearance
and
in
visible
perturbation
at
having
found
stuart
here
again
if
i
can
constitute
a
jealousy
between
them
it
will
add
to
the
animation
of
several
scenes
i
therefore
praised
stuart
to
the
skies
and
mentioned
my
having
asked
him
to
tea
his
lordship
flew
into
a
violent
rage
and
swore
that
the
villain
wanted
to
unheroinize
me
in
order
to
gain
me
himself
he
then
renewed
his
entreaties
that
i
would
consent
to
an
immediate
marriage
but
now
the
benefits
of
my
fatal
vow
shone
forth
in
their
full
lustre
and
its
irrevocability
gave
rise
to
some
of
the
finest
agonies
that
his
lordship
ever
exhibited
at
length
we
separated
to
dress
for
dinner
at
my
toilette
i
recollected
with
exactness
every
particular
of
his
late
conversation
his
sentiments
so
congenial
with
mine
his
manners
so
engaging
his
countenance
so
noble
and
ingenuous
shall
see
him
no
more
said
i
a
sigh
that
followed
told
me
more
of
my
heart
than
i
wished
to
know
no
my
biddy
never
never
can
he
be
mine
i
must
banish
his
dear
image
from
my
mind
and
to
speak
in
the
simple
and
unsophisticated
language
of
the
heroine
in
the
forest
of
montalbo
surely
i
think
we
ought
under
existing
circumstances
dearest
dearest
madam
to
avoid
where
we
can
every
allusion
to
this
i
fear
alas
our
indeed
hopeless
adieu
letter
xvi
when
stuart
came
he
found
his
lordship
the
landlady
the
poet
and
myself
sitting
round
the
at
first
the
conversation
was
general
and
on
the
topics
of
the
day
these
stuart
discussed
with
much
animation
and
volubility
while
his
lordship
sat
silent
and
contemptuous
i
fancy
that
his
illustrious
tongue
disdained
to
trifle
meantime
higginson
in
a
new
coat
and
waistcoat
sat
anglicising
the
latinity
of
his
face
and
copying
the
manners
and
attitudes
of
montmorenci
whom
the
poor
man
i
verily
believe
is
endeavouring
to
rival
at
length
the
word
poetry
caught
his
ear
he
gave
the
graces
to
the
winds
and
listened
continued
stuart
to
me
poetry
must
be
much
more
useful
than
encomiastic
said
higginson
drawing
back
his
head
and
lowering
his
voice
as
if
he
dreaded
nothing
so
much
as
being
heard
must
beg
leave
in
all
humility
to
coincide
with
your
exprest
proposition
but
to
suggest
a
doubt
whether
it
be
decorous
to
violate
the
repose
of
noble
blood
the
great
deserve
exposure
as
much
as
the
mean
said
stuart
rank
is
rather
a
reason
why
they
should
be
censured
sooner
because
their
bad
example
is
more
conspicuous
and
therefore
more
detrimental
said
i
satirizing
the
vicious
may
be
beneficial
to
the
community
is
it
always
advantageous
to
the
satirist
observes
answered
stuart
is
no
less
a
proof
of
eminence
to
have
many
enemies
than
many
and
indeed
without
the
one
we
seldom
have
the
other
on
the
whole
however
i
would
advise
a
writer
not
to
drop
the
in
grasping
at
the
rod
though
those
whom
he
finds
privately
endeavouring
to
vilify
his
own
character
entitles
him
to
expose
without
mercy
satire
is
salutary
to
society
i
am
convinced
said
i
becomes
mischievous
only
when
it
is
aimed
at
the
worthy
heart
yet
said
stuart
that
are
loudest
in
declaiming
against
the
satirist
are
often
fondest
of
disseminating
the
satire
now
he
who
slanders
with
his
tongue
is
just
as
culpable
as
he
who
defames
with
his
pen
for
if
the
one
weapon
be
not
as
extensive
in
its
effects
as
the
other
the
motives
of
those
who
use
it
are
equally
vile
hume
in
one
of
his
essays
says
that
whisper
may
fly
as
quick
and
be
as
pernicious
as
a
i
think
said
i
those
who
never
allow
people
faults
are
just
as
injurious
to
the
community
as
those
who
never
allow
them
virtues
said
stuart
a
late
publication
which
equals
in
sentiment
diction
and
pictures
of
character
any
work
of
the
kind
in
our
language
thus
concludes
a
description
of
them
assuming
the
name
of
say
that
for
their
part
they
wish
to
avoid
making
enemies
and
when
they
can
not
speak
well
of
people
they
make
it
a
rule
not
to
speak
of
them
at
all
now
this
is
an
admirable
system
for
thus
permitting
vice
they
sanction
it
and
by
not
opposing
assist
its
you
see
said
higginson
next
to
laws
and
religion
which
correct
the
serious
derelictions
writing
which
chastises
the
smaller
foibles
is
the
most
useful
instrument
in
a
state
whispered
i
to
stuart
the
ruling
passion
breaks
forth
therefore
continued
higginson
to
the
legislator
and
divine
the
poet
is
the
most
exalted
member
of
the
community
me
there
said
i
most
exalted
members
are
not
legislators
or
divines
or
poets
who
prescribe
but
heroes
and
heroines
who
perform
you
mean
the
heroes
and
heroines
of
romance
said
stuart
performances
are
useful
in
teaching
us
what
we
should
shun
not
what
we
should
imitate
the
heroine
in
particular
quits
a
comfortable
home
turns
out
to
be
the
best
pedestrian
in
the
world
and
after
weeping
tears
enough
to
float
her
weds
some
captious
passionate
and
kneeling
hero
cried
i
to
remain
a
domesticated
rosy
little
miss
who
romps
with
the
squire
plays
an
old
tune
on
an
old
piano
and
reads
prayers
for
the
good
family
servants
and
all
at
last
marrying
some
honest
gentleman
who
lives
on
his
saddle
she
degenerates
into
a
dangler
of
keys
and
whipper
of
children
trots
up
and
down
stairs
educates
the
poultry
and
superintends
the
architecture
of
pies
for
my
part
said
stuart
would
have
a
young
lady
neither
a
mere
homely
drudge
nor
a
heroine
let
off
into
the
clouds
i
would
educate
her
heart
and
head
as
well
as
her
fingers
and
feet
she
should
be
at
once
the
ornament
of
the
social
group
and
the
delight
of
the
domestic
circle
abroad
attractive
at
home
endearing
the
enchantress
to
whom
levity
would
apply
for
mirth
and
wisdom
for
admonition
and
her
mirth
should
be
graceful
and
her
admonition
fascinating
if
she
happened
to
be
solitary
she
should
have
the
power
of
contemplation
and
if
her
needle
broke
she
should
be
capable
of
finding
resource
in
a
book
in
a
word
she
should
present
a
proof
that
wit
is
not
inconsistent
with
nor
liveliness
with
and
that
to
make
the
virtues
attractive
they
ought
to
be
adorned
with
the
graces
pray
to
whom
would
you
marry
this
charmer
asked
his
lordship
winking
at
me
replied
he
she
wishes
to
settle
in
life
i
would
have
her
consult
her
parents
and
make
a
prudent
match
prudent
match
cried
i
conceive
a
prudent
match
oh
stuart
i
declare
i
am
quite
ashamed
of
you
honour
said
his
lordship
are
too
severe
i
will
bet
five
to
four
he
means
well
doubt
said
i
to
be
candid
i
think
him
a
mighty
good
sort
of
a
man
proper
behaved
young
person
said
his
lordship
honest
added
i
worthy
soul
said
he
respectable
character
cried
i
decent
creature
said
he
humane
and
pious
christian
cried
i
this
last
hit
was
irresistible
and
both
of
us
burst
out
laughing
while
stuart
sat
silent
and
even
affected
to
smile
is
your
time
whispered
i
to
his
lordship
few
more
sarcasms
and
he
crouches
to
you
for
ever
fancy
young
gentleman
said
his
lordship
turning
full
upon
stuart
and
laughing
so
long
that
i
thought
he
would
never
finish
the
sentence
fancy
my
tight
fellow
you
may
now
knock
under
am
not
always
inclined
to
do
so
replied
stuart
am
i
easily
provoked
to
knock
down
down
whom
demanded
his
lordship
with
the
most
complete
frown
i
had
ever
beheld
puppy
said
stuart
coolly
lie
vociferated
our
hero
the
room
sir
cried
stuart
starting
from
his
seat
montmorenci
rose
retreated
to
the
door
stopped
went
on
stopped
again
moved
stopped
cried
stuart
advancing
his
lordship
vanished
i
ran
snatched
a
pen
and
wrote
on
a
scrap
of
paper
your
honour
or
never
appear
in
my
presence
i
then
rang
the
bell
for
the
maid
and
slipping
some
silver
into
her
hand
begged
that
she
would
deliver
the
paper
to
his
lordship
higginson
then
started
from
his
chair
a
deliberate
consideration
of
the
subject
said
he
am
more
and
more
convinced
that
a
poet
is
the
first
character
in
society
during
a
whole
hour
i
remained
in
a
state
of
the
most
distracting
suspense
for
he
never
returned
meantime
stuart
was
privately
pressing
me
to
leave
my
lodgings
and
remain
at
his
father
till
wilkinson
should
be
found
indignant
at
the
cowardly
conduct
of
his
lordship
i
was
almost
consenting
when
on
a
sudden
the
door
flew
open
and
with
a
slow
step
and
dignified
deportment
lord
altamont
mortimer
montmorenci
entered
all
eyes
were
rivetted
on
him
he
walked
towards
stuart
and
fell
upon
one
knee
before
him
come
sir
said
he
retract
that
abuse
which
i
gave
you
just
now
i
submit
to
whatever
punishment
you
please
nor
shall
i
think
my
honour
till
my
fault
is
repaired
then
grant
me
the
pardon
that
i
beg
on
whatever
conditions
you
think
proper
shame
exclaimed
i
with
an
indignation
that
i
could
not
suppress
a
hero
his
lordship
instantly
snatched
a
book
from
his
pocket
and
opening
a
passage
presented
it
to
me
the
book
was
nouvelle
see
there
said
he
lord
after
having
given
preux
the
lie
begs
forgiveness
on
his
knees
and
in
the
precise
words
which
i
have
just
used
will
cherubina
condemn
the
conduct
that
heloise
applauded
excellent
ever
exalted
mortal
cried
i
thou
art
indeed
all
that
is
just
dignified
magnanimous
i
gave
him
my
hand
and
he
bowed
over
it
supper
was
announced
mirth
ruled
the
night
the
landlady
sat
gazing
on
his
lordship
his
lordship
on
me
stuart
uttered
a
thousand
witticisms
and
even
the
poet
determined
to
be
heard
for
in
the
midst
of
our
merriment
i
saw
him
with
his
mouth
open
and
his
neck
stretched
forward
watching
for
the
first
moment
of
silence
it
came
is
the
fun
equalled
by
none
so
never
never
never
have
done
cried
the
happy
creature
and
protruded
such
an
exorbitant
laugh
as
made
ample
amends
for
the
gravity
of
his
whole
life
at
length
stuart
took
leave
and
the
rest
of
us
separated
to
our
several
apartments
that
coxcomb
i
see
has
no
notion
of
sentiment
and
no
taste
for
admiring
those
who
have
there
he
sits
calm
unconcerned
and
never
once
fixes
his
eyes
on
me
with
a
speaking
gaze
oh
no
nothing
but
wit
or
wisdom
for
him
not
only
is
the
fellow
far
from
a
pathetic
turn
himself
but
he
has
also
an
odd
faculty
of
detaching
even
me
from
my
miseries
and
of
reducing
me
to
horrid
hilarity
it
would
vex
a
saint
to
see
how
he
makes
me
laugh
though
i
am
predetermined
not
to
give
him
a
single
smile
but
montmorenci
the
sentimental
montmorenci
timely
interposes
the
fine
melancholy
of
his
features
he
looks
he
sighs
he
speaks
and
in
a
moment
i
am
recalled
to
the
soft
emotions
and
a
due
sense
of
my
deplorable
destiny
adieu
letter
xvii
clouds
are
impending
and
i
know
not
whether
they
will
clash
together
and
elicit
lightning
or
mingle
into
one
and
descend
in
refreshing
showers
this
morning
montmorenci
the
hostess
and
myself
breakfasted
early
and
then
went
shopping
i
purchased
a
charming
scarf
a
bonnet
two
dresses
a
diamond
cross
and
a
pair
of
pearl
his
lordship
borrowed
a
guinea
from
me
and
then
bought
a
small
casket
which
he
presented
to
me
in
the
handsomest
manner
we
next
visited
westminster
abbey
the
first
that
i
have
ever
seen
though
i
had
read
of
thousands
to
my
great
disappointment
i
found
in
it
no
cowled
monks
with
scapulars
and
no
veiled
nuns
with
rosaries
nothing
but
statues
of
statesmen
and
warriors
in
stone
wigs
and
marble
regimentals
soon
after
we
had
returned
home
higginson
entered
my
room
stealing
and
with
a
look
of
terror
mother
presents
her
respectful
compliments
said
he
in
a
whisper
begs
you
will
honour
her
with
your
presence
that
she
may
do
herself
the
pleasure
of
saving
you
from
destruction
me
said
i
with
a
look
that
pierced
into
his
soul
character
do
mean
to
support
on
this
occasion
that
of
my
friend
or
of
an
accomplice
in
the
plot
against
me
higginson
looked
aghast
to
your
being
a
principal
continued
i
is
not
likely
but
i
must
ascertain
if
your
object
is
to
be
excuse
me
an
understrapping
ruffian
never
fear
speak
your
mind
candidly
i
was
writing
verses
on
you
all
the
morning
and
it
was
for
you
that
i
clipped
my
eyebrows
and
it
was
for
you
that
i
dear
me
dear
me
cried
the
poor
man
and
began
whimpering
like
a
child
said
i
it
is
not
your
taste
that
is
another
affair
but
though
i
can
not
countenance
you
as
a
villain
i
will
at
least
respect
you
as
an
honest
man
i
will
i
assure
you
so
now
lead
me
to
your
mother
we
proceeded
up
stairs
and
entered
a
garret
where
his
mother
a
corpulent
old
lady
was
lying
in
a
fit
of
the
gout
higginson
having
introduced
us
said
she
sent
for
you
to
tell
you
that
i
have
just
overheard
your
hostess
and
an
old
gentleman
betterton
i
think
she
called
him
planning
something
against
you
they
were
in
the
next
room
and
thought
i
could
not
hear
but
this
i
know
that
he
offered
her
fifty
pounds
if
she
would
assist
him
in
obtaining
you
and
so
miss
from
all
my
son
says
of
you
and
sure
enough
he
raves
of
you
like
mad
i
thought
you
would
wish
to
be
saved
from
ruin
madam
answered
i
the
same
time
i
must
beg
permission
to
remark
that
you
have
destroyed
half
the
interest
of
this
intrigue
against
me
by
forewarning
me
of
it
be
so
miss
said
she
have
done
my
duty
as
a
christian
however
said
i
not
suppose
i
resent
your
conduct
old
lady
i
am
sure
you
meant
all
for
the
best
and
i
sincerely
wish
you
health
and
happiness
farewell
on
returning
to
my
room
i
found
betterton
there
before
me
he
came
to
request
that
i
would
accept
of
a
ticket
for
the
masquerade
at
the
pantheon
and
he
gave
another
to
the
landlady
who
he
said
must
accompany
me
thither
so
is
clear
that
he
means
to
decoy
me
from
it
unhappy
girl
but
how
can
i
refuse
going
a
heroine
you
know
never
misses
a
masquerade
it
is
always
the
scene
of
her
best
adventure
and
to
say
the
truth
i
can
not
resist
the
temptation
of
so
delightful
an
amusement
now
to
consult
about
my
character
letter
xviii
at
dinner
yesterday
i
bespoke
his
lordship
as
an
escort
to
the
masquerade
and
we
then
held
a
council
of
dress
it
was
resolved
that
i
should
appear
in
the
character
of
sterne
maria
and
his
lordship
as
corporal
trim
this
morning
just
as
i
had
finished
reading
the
in
the
children
of
the
abbey
betterton
and
the
landlady
came
into
my
room
and
in
a
short
time
i
perceived
the
purport
of
their
visit
as
they
began
requesting
that
i
would
not
take
either
stuart
or
montmorenci
with
me
to
the
masquerade
fact
is
miss
said
the
landlady
i
have
heard
your
real
story
grundy
is
not
your
cousin
at
all
and
your
name
is
wilkinson
not
donald
howsomever
as
i
believe
you
meant
no
harm
in
this
deception
i
am
willing
at
the
solicitations
of
this
excellent
gentleman
to
let
you
remain
in
my
house
provided
you
promise
not
to
receive
any
more
visits
from
that
stuart
who
is
the
greatest
villain
unhanged
or
from
grundy
who
has
certainly
bad
designs
on
you
though
he
made
proposals
of
marriage
to
myself
no
longer
ago
than
yesterday
a
tapping
at
my
door
prevented
me
from
expressing
my
total
disbelief
in
her
latter
assertion
it
struck
me
that
should
the
person
prove
to
be
his
lordship
i
might
make
her
look
extremely
foolish
by
letting
her
overhear
his
declarations
of
attachment
to
me
yourselves
in
this
closet
whispered
i
to
my
visitors
have
particular
reasons
they
looked
at
each
other
and
hesitated
in
said
i
i
suspect
that
this
visit
is
from
a
villain
and
i
wish
you
to
hear
what
passes
both
then
went
into
the
closet
i
opened
the
door
of
my
chamber
and
to
my
great
disappointment
the
poet
appeared
at
it
with
his
eyes
rolling
and
his
mouth
ajar
is
the
matter
asked
i
he
gaped
still
wider
but
said
nothing
cried
i
is
an
awkward
attempt
at
expressing
horror
if
you
have
any
hideous
news
to
communicate
why
do
you
not
rush
into
the
room
tossing
your
hands
on
high
and
exclaiming
fly
fair
lady
all
is
lost
miss
said
he
was
never
in
the
way
of
learning
good
breeding
but
do
go
to
the
masquerade
miss
oh
do
my
mother
overheard
old
betterton
just
now
planning
with
the
landlady
to
carry
you
from
it
by
force
but
miss
i
have
a
fine
sword
above
stairs
three
feet
and
a
half
long
and
i
will
rub
off
the
rust
and
a
knock
at
the
interrupted
him
i
was
in
a
hiding
mood
already
the
scene
promised
wonders
and
i
resolved
not
to
damp
its
rising
spirit
so
made
the
simple
higginson
get
underneath
the
sofa
the
next
moment
my
door
opened
and
vixen
montmorenci
terrier
came
bounding
towards
me
dear
vixen
cried
i
snatching
her
to
my
bosom
back
to
your
master
all
that
nourishes
his
remembrance
go
dear
vixen
guard
him
by
night
and
accompany
him
by
day
serve
him
with
zeal
and
love
him
with
fidelity
i
turned
round
and
perceived
montmorenci
the
poor
timid
girl
bent
her
eyes
to
the
ground
dear
vixen
said
he
have
now
indeed
a
claim
to
my
regard
and
with
the
fondest
gratitude
will
i
cherish
you
he
then
flew
to
me
and
poured
forth
at
my
feet
the
most
passionate
acknowledgments
and
tender
protestations
i
tried
to
break
from
him
loveliest
cherubina
said
he
detaining
me
thus
must
we
part
must
part
for
ever
exclaimed
i
that
rash
soliloquy
which
you
have
just
heard
never
can
i
bear
you
in
my
sight
besides
sir
you
are
betrothed
at
this
moment
to
another
ridiculous
but
to
whom
hostess
a
most
charming
woman
hostess
yes
a
charming
woman
indeed
she
has
roses
in
her
cheek
and
lilies
in
her
skin
but
they
are
white
roses
and
orange
lilies
our
hostess
beshrew
my
heart
i
would
let
cobwebs
grow
on
my
lips
before
i
would
kiss
her
another
knock
came
to
the
door
miserable
exclaimed
i
this
be
the
person
i
suspect
we
are
both
undone
separated
for
ever
what
where
shall
i
hide
cried
his
lordship
dark
closet
said
i
pointing
his
lordship
sprang
into
the
closet
and
closed
the
door
can
hear
no
tidings
of
your
father
said
stuart
entering
the
room
have
searched
every
hotel
in
town
and
i
really
fear
that
some
accident
upon
me
who
here
cried
his
lordship
from
the
closet
i
hope
to
be
saved
the
place
is
full
of
people
let
me
go
whoever
the
devil
you
are
let
me
go
that
and
that
and
that
you
poor
pitiful
vociferated
the
landlady
buffetting
him
about
that
unhappy
young
nobleman
bolted
from
the
closet
with
his
face
running
blood
and
the
landlady
fast
at
his
heels
you
dog
exclaimed
she
have
discovered
your
treacherousness
at
last
as
for
your
and
trinkets
to
me
villain
i
never
valued
a
pin
point
but
that
you
should
go
for
to
try
to
ruin
this
sweet
innocent
young
creature
that
is
what
distresses
me
so
it
is
and
she
burst
out
crying
and
trinkets
to
you
exclaimed
i
he
was
not
so
base
madam
he
was
so
base
madam
said
she
with
a
bitter
look
if
you
fancy
that
is
yourself
he
loves
why
look
there
read
the
letter
he
sent
me
yesterday
just
after
i
had
asked
him
to
pay
me
for
six
diet
and
lodging
i
read
my
lovely
hostess
the
pair
of
bracelets
which
accompanies
this
note
and
rest
assured
that
i
will
discharge
my
bill
in
the
course
of
another
month
motive
for
having
brought
miss
wilkinson
into
your
house
as
my
cousin
was
simply
to
restore
her
to
her
friends
your
jealousy
though
most
unfounded
is
most
flattering
how
little
do
you
know
your
grundy
if
i
pay
the
silly
girl
a
few
slight
attentions
it
is
only
to
cloak
that
tenderness
for
you
which
preys
upon
my
heart
and
consumes
my
vitals
that
tenderness
which
i
yesterday
so
solemnly
vowed
to
evince
as
soon
as
my
affairs
are
arranged
at
the
altar
own
own
own
grundy
it
was
as
much
as
my
dignity
could
do
to
suppress
my
indignation
at
this
letter
but
the
heroine
prevailed
and
i
cast
on
his
lordship
my
famous
compound
expression
of
pity
contempt
and
surprise
which
i
tinged
with
just
fascination
enough
to
remind
him
of
what
a
jewel
he
had
lost
meantime
he
stood
wiping
his
face
and
did
not
utter
a
word
now
cried
i
for
the
grand
developement
james
higginson
come
forth
in
a
moment
the
poet
was
seen
creeping
like
a
huge
tortoise
from
under
the
sofa
higginson
said
i
not
your
mother
tell
you
that
this
lady
here
this
amiable
lady
and
i
curtsied
low
to
her
and
she
curtsied
still
lower
to
me
this
first
and
best
of
women
and
again
we
exchanged
rival
curtsies
plotting
with
a
betterton
to
betray
me
into
his
hands
at
the
masquerade
answered
the
poet
with
a
firm
demeanour
do
solemnly
certify
and
asseverate
that
so
my
mother
told
me
your
mother
told
a
confounded
falsehood
cried
betterton
popping
out
of
the
closet
higginson
walked
up
to
him
and
knocked
him
down
with
the
greatest
gravity
imaginable
the
hostess
ran
at
higginson
and
fastened
her
fangs
in
his
face
montmorenci
laid
hold
of
the
hostess
and
off
came
her
cap
stuart
dropped
into
a
chair
with
laughter
i
too
forgot
all
my
dignity
and
clapped
my
hands
and
danced
with
delight
while
they
kicked
and
scratched
each
other
without
mercy
at
length
stuart
interfered
and
separated
the
combatants
the
landlady
retired
to
repair
her
dismantled
head
and
his
lordship
and
higginson
to
wash
their
wounds
betterton
too
was
about
to
take
his
departure
said
stuart
must
beg
leave
to
detain
you
for
a
few
moments
betterton
bowed
and
returned
name
is
betterton
i
believe
is
sir
higginson
accusation
of
you
said
stuart
feel
myself
called
upon
as
the
friend
of
this
lady
father
to
insist
on
your
apologizing
for
the
designs
which
you
have
dared
to
harbour
against
her
and
to
demand
an
unequivocal
renunciation
of
those
views
for
the
future
are
an
honest
fellow
said
betterton
i
respect
your
spirit
most
sincerely
most
humbly
miss
wilkinson
do
i
solicit
your
forgiveness
and
i
beg
you
will
believe
that
nothing
but
a
misrepresentation
of
your
real
character
and
history
tempted
me
to
treat
you
with
such
undeserved
insult
i
now
declare
that
you
have
nothing
further
to
fear
from
me
before
i
can
feel
perfectly
satisfied
said
stuart
must
stipulate
for
the
discontinuance
of
your
visits
to
miss
wilkinson
as
a
proof
that
you
have
relinquished
all
improper
projects
against
her
had
formed
that
resolution
before
you
spoke
answered
betterton
many
a
bitter
pang
it
will
cost
me
now
then
we
are
all
friends
i
may
have
my
faults
but
upon
my
soul
i
am
a
man
of
honour
i
am
upon
my
soul
as
for
you
stuart
without
flattery
you
have
evinced
more
discretion
and
coolness
throughout
this
affair
than
i
have
ever
seen
in
so
young
a
man
sir
you
are
an
honour
to
the
human
race
and
i
wish
you
would
dine
with
me
this
evening
at
the
crown
and
anchor
some
friends
of
us
meet
there
to
discuss
a
radical
reform
do
my
dear
fellow
we
want
nothing
but
men
of
respectability
like
you
for
our
sentiments
are
the
finest
in
the
world
will
excuse
me
said
stuart
i
am
told
that
your
wines
are
as
fine
and
as
foreign
as
your
sentiments
adieu
good
people
said
betterton
of
me
with
kindness
faults
i
may
have
but
my
heart
tapping
at
it
with
his
forefinger
is
right
here
after
he
had
left
us
i
reprimanded
stuart
so
severely
for
his
officiousness
in
having
interfered
about
betterton
that
he
went
away
quite
offended
and
i
much
fear
will
never
return
if
he
does
not
he
will
use
me
basely
to
leave
me
here
in
this
unprotected
state
after
all
his
anxieties
about
me
anxieties
too
which
i
can
not
tell
why
have
pleased
me
beyond
expression
i
confess
i
feel
a
regard
for
the
man
and
should
be
sorry
to
have
hurt
his
feelings
seriously
would
sir
charles
bingley
have
deserted
me
so
i
ask
no
but
stuart
has
no
notion
of
being
a
plain
useful
unsuccessful
lover
like
him
well
i
must
say
i
hate
to
see
a
man
more
ready
to
fall
out
with
one
than
to
fall
in
love
with
one
but
montmorenci
what
shall
i
say
of
him
how
can
he
possibly
exculpate
himself
from
his
treacherous
intrigue
with
the
landlady
i
confess
i
am
predisposed
to
credit
any
feasible
excuse
which
he
can
assign
rather
than
find
myself
deceived
outrivalled
and
deprived
of
a
lover
not
alone
dear
to
me
but
indispensible
to
the
progress
of
my
memoirs
then
that
from
which
i
had
a
right
to
expect
the
true
pathetic
what
a
it
became
in
short
i
feel
at
this
moment
disgusted
with
the
world
i
half
wish
i
were
at
home
again
now
too
that
stuart
has
reminded
me
of
our
early
days
i
can
not
avoid
sometimes
picturing
to
myself
the
familiar
fireside
the
walks
frolics
occupations
of
our
childhood
and
well
i
remember
how
he
used
to
humour
my
whims
oh
these
times
are
past
and
now
he
opposes
me
in
every
thing
but
whither
am
i
wandering
pardon
these
vulgar
sentiments
they
have
escaped
my
pen
you
know
that
a
mere
home
is
my
horror
forgive
them
adieu
letter
xix
determined
to
support
my
dignity
i
dined
alone
in
my
room
after
the
and
during
this
evening
letters
of
the
most
nature
passed
between
his
lordship
and
me
to
be
brief
he
has
convinced
me
that
the
letter
written
in
his
name
to
the
landlady
was
a
forgery
of
her
own
the
circumventing
wretch
i
am
of
opinion
that
it
ought
to
be
made
a
hanging
matter
the
following
is
an
extract
from
his
and
my
correspondence
after
a
most
satisfactory
disquisition
on
the
various
circumstances
tending
to
prove
the
forgery
he
writes
thus
have
begun
twenty
letters
to
you
and
have
torn
them
all
i
write
to
you
on
my
knees
and
the
paper
is
blistered
with
my
tears
but
i
have
dried
it
with
my
sighs
moon
and
stars
may
rise
and
set
as
they
will
i
know
not
whether
it
be
day
or
whether
it
be
night
the
girl
came
with
your
last
note
the
idea
that
your
eyes
had
just
been
dwelling
on
her
features
on
her
cap
ribbon
and
apron
made
her
and
them
so
interesting
so
dear
to
me
that
though
her
features
are
snubbed
her
cap
tattered
her
ribbon
which
i
hate
and
her
apron
dirty
i
should
certainly
have
taken
her
in
my
arms
if
i
had
not
been
the
most
bashful
of
men
that
note
stung
me
to
the
heart
the
words
were
hosts
of
angels
to
me
and
the
small
paper
the
interminable
regions
of
bliss
any
thing
from
you
my
heart
beats
and
my
blood
boils
in
my
veins
when
by
chance
our
feet
meet
under
the
table
the
diapason
of
my
vibrates
to
the
touch
how
often
i
call
to
mind
the
sweet
reproof
you
once
gave
me
at
dinner
when
i
trod
on
your
toe
in
a
transport
of
passion
if
you
love
me
tell
me
so
said
you
smiling
but
do
not
hurt
my
foot
little
incident
is
always
recurring
to
me
as
we
parted
from
each
other
the
night
before
last
you
held
out
your
hand
and
said
my
dear
montmorenci
it
was
the
first
time
you
had
ever
called
me
the
sound
sank
deep
into
my
heart
i
have
repeated
it
a
hundred
times
since
and
when
i
went
to
bed
i
said
good
night
my
dear
montmorenci
i
recollected
myself
and
laughed
the
fatal
kiss
that
i
once
dared
to
snatch
from
you
has
undone
me
for
ever
the
moisture
on
your
lip
was
like
a
suppuration
of
rubies
o
immortal
remembrance
of
that
illusive
frantic
and
enchanting
moment

in
person
to
perfect
the
reconciliation

was
so
tender

excruciating

scene

then
consulted
about
the

me
down

it
the
montero

and
tarnished
regimentals

he
procured

theatre

after
his
departure
a
letter
was
brought
to
me
by
the
maid
who
said

dark
cloak

excellent
old

my

adieu
letter
xx
i
believe
i
mentioned
in
a
former
letter
that
my
was
on
the
ground
floor
and
looking
into
the
yard
at
the
back
of
the
house
soon
after
i
went
to
bed
last
night
i
heard
a
whispering
and
rustling
outside
of
the
window
and
while
i
was
awaiting
with
anxiety
the
result
sleep
surprised
me
i
awoke
earlier
as
i
thought
than
usual
this
morning
for
not
a
ray
penetrated
my
curtainless
window
i
then
tried
to
compose
myself
to
sleep
again
but
in
vain
so
there
i
lay
turning
and
tumbling
about
for
eight
or
nine
hours
at
the
very
least
at
last
i
became
alarmed
what
can
be
the
matter
thought
i
is
the
sun
quenched
or
eclipsed
or
has
the
globe
ceased
rolling
or
am
i
struck
stone
blind
in
the
midst
of
my
conjectures
a
sudden
cry
of
fire
fire
reverberated
through
the
house
i
sprang
out
of
bed
and
huddled
on
me
whatever
cloaths
came
to
hand
i
then
groped
for
my
casket
of
jewels
and
having
secured
it
rushed
into
the
outer
room
where
my
eyes
were
instantly
dazzled
by
the
sudden
glare
of
light
however
i
had
presence
of
mind
enough
to
snatch
up
corporal
coat
which
still
remained
on
a
chair
and
to
slip
it
on
me
for
in
the
first
place
i
had
no
gown
underneath
and
in
the
next
i
recollected
that
harriot
byron
at
a
moment
of
distress
went
wild
about
the
country
in
masquerade
hurrying
into
the
hall
i
saw
the
street
door
wide
open
stuart
and
montmorenci
struggling
with
each
other
near
it
the
landlady
dragging
a
trunk
down
stairs
and
looking
like
the
ghost
of
a
mad
housemaid
and
the
poet
just
behind
her
with
his
corpulent
mother
bed
and
all
upon
his
back
while
she
kept
exclaiming
that
we
should
all
be
in
heaven
in
five
minutes
and
he
crying
out
heaven
forbid
heaven
forbid
i
darted
past
stuart
just
as
he
had
got
montmorenci
down
thence
out
of
the
house
and
had
fled
twenty
paces
before
i
discovered
that
so
far
from
being
night
it
was
broad
bright
incontrovertible
day
i
had
no
time
to
reflect
on
this
mystery
as
i
heard
steps
pursuing
me
and
my
name
called
i
fled
the
faster
for
i
dreaded
i
knew
not
what
the
portentous
darkness
of
my
room
the
false
alarm
of
fire
all
betokened
some
diabolical
conspiracy
against
my
life
so
i
rushed
along
the
street
to
the
horror
and
astonishment
of
all
who
saw
me
for
conceive
me
drest
in
a
red
coat
stiff
with
tarnished
lace
a
satin
petticoat
satin
shoes
no
stockings
and
my
flaxen
hair
streaming
like
a
meteor
behind
me
stop
her
stop
her
was
now
shouted
on
all
sides
hundreds
seemed
in
pursuit
panting
and
almost
exhausted
i
still
continued
my
flight
they
gained
on
me
what
should
i
do
i
saw
the
door
of
a
carriage
just
opened
and
two
ladies
dressed
for
dinner
stepping
into
it
i
sprang
in
after
them
crying
save
me
save
me
the
footman
endeavoured
to
drag
me
out
the
mob
gathered
round
shouting
the
horses
took
fright
and
set
off
in
full
gallop
i
meantime
on
one
knee
with
my
meek
eyes
raised
and
my
hands
folded
across
my
bosom
awaited
my
fate
while
the
ladies
gazed
on
me
in
dismay
and
supported
one
unbroken
scream
at
last
the
carriage
dashed
against
a
post
and
was
upset
several
persons
ran
forward
and
i
being
uppermost
took
me
out
the
first
again
i
began
running
and
again
a
mob
was
at
my
heels
i
felt
certain
they
would
tear
me
in
pieces
my
head
became
bewildered
and
all
the
horrid
sights
i
had
ever
read
of
rose
in
array
before
me
bacchantes
animated
with
orphean
fury
slinging
their
serpents
in
the
air
and
uttering
dithyrambics
appeared
to
surround
me
on
every
side
on
i
flew
knock
it
down
cried
several
voices
a
footman
was
just
entering
a
house
i
rushed
past
him
and
into
a
parlour
where
a
large
party
were
sitting
at
dinner
save
me
exclaimed
i
and
sank
on
my
knees
before
them
all
arose
some
in
springing
to
seize
me
fell
and
others
began
dragging
me
away
i
grasped
the
in
my
confusion
and
the
next
instant
the
whole
dinner
was
strewn
about
the
floor
those
who
had
fallen
down
rose
in
piteous
plight
one
bathed
in
soup
another
crowned
with
vegetables
and
the
face
of
a
third
all
over
harico
they
held
me
fast
and
questioned
me
then
called
me
mad
and
turned
me
into
the
street
the
mob
were
still
waiting
for
me
there
and
they
cheered
me
as
i
came
out
so
seeing
a
shop
at
hand
i
darted
through
it
and
ran
up
stairs
into
the
there
i
found
a
mother
in
the
cruel
act
of
whipping
her
child
ever
a
victim
to
thrilling
sensibility
i
snatched
the
rod
from
her
hand
she
shrieked
and
alarmed
the
house
and
again
i
was
turned
out
of
doors
again
my
friend
the
mob
received
me
with
a
shout
again
i
took
to
flight
rushed
through
another
shop
was
turned
out
through
another
was
turned
out
in
short
i
threaded
a
dozen
different
houses
and
witnessed
a
dozen
different
domestic
scenes
in
this
they
were
singing
in
that
scolding
here
i
caught
an
old
man
kissing
the
maid
there
i
found
a
young
man
reading
the
bible
entering
another
i
heard
ladies
laughing
and
dancing
in
the
i
hurried
past
them
to
the
garrets
and
saw
their
aged
servant
dying
shocked
by
the
sight
i
paused
at
his
door
not
a
soul
was
in
the
room
with
him
and
vials
and
basons
strewed
the
table
that
my
daughter
said
he
feebly
no
one
go
for
my
daughter
to
desert
me
thus
after
first
breaking
my
heart
well
then
i
will
find
her
out
myself
he
made
a
sudden
effort
to
rise
but
it
was
fatal
his
head
and
arms
dropped
down
motionless
and
hung
out
of
the
bed
he
gave
a
hollow
sob
and
expired
horrorstruck
i
rushed
into
an
adjoining
garret
and
burst
into
tears
i
felt
guilty
of
i
knew
not
what
and
the
picture
of
wilkinson
dying
in
the
madhouse
and
calling
on
his
daughter
shot
across
me
for
a
moment
the
noise
of
people
searching
the
rooms
below
and
ascending
the
stairs
put
an
end
to
my
disagreeable
reflections
and
i
thought
but
of
escape
running
to
the
window
of
the
garret
i
found
that
it
opened
upon
the
roof
of
a
neighbouring
house
and
recollecting
that
robbers
often
escape
by
similar
means
i
sprang
out
of
the
window
closed
it
after
me
and
ran
along
a
whole
row
of
roofs
at
last
i
came
to
a
house
higher
than
the
rest
with
a
small
window
similar
to
that
by
which
i
had
just
got
out
and
happily
lying
open
on
looking
into
the
garret
i
found
that
nobody
was
there
so
i
scrambled
into
it
and
fastened
the
window
after
me
a
servant
bed
a
chair
a
table
and
an
immense
chest
constituted
all
the
furniture
the
chest
had
nothing
but
a
little
linen
in
it
and
i
determined
to
make
it
my
place
of
refuge
in
case
of
an
alarm
having
sat
a
few
minutes
to
compose
my
spirits
after
the
shock
they
had
just
experienced
i
resolved
on
exploring
the
several
apartments
for
i
felt
a
secret
presentiment
that
this
house
was
some
way
or
other
connected
with
my
fate
a
most
natural
idea
i
first
traversed
the
garrets
but
found
nothing
in
them
worthy
of
horror
so
i
stole
with
cautious
steps
down
the
first
flight
of
stairs
and
found
the
door
of
the
front
room
open
hearing
no
noise
inside
i
ventured
to
put
in
my
head
and
perceived
a
large
table
with
lighted
candles
on
it
and
covered
over
with
dresses
of
various
descriptions
besides
bonnets
feathers
caps
and
ribbons
in
profusion
whence
i
concluded
that
the
people
of
the
house
were
milliners
here
i
sat
some
time
admiring
the
dresses
and
trying
at
a
mirror
how
the
caps
became
me
till
i
was
interrupted
by
steps
on
the
stairs
i
ran
behind
a
and
immediately
three
young
milliners
came
into
the
room
they
sat
down
at
the
table
and
began
working
wonder
said
one
our
lodger
has
returned
from
dinner
a
sly
eye
the
fellow
casts
at
me
says
another
how
he
smiles
at
me
says
the
first
how
he
teases
me
about
my
being
pretty
says
the
second
me
too
says
the
first
he
presses
my
hand
into
the
bargain
says
the
second
he
mine
and
just
think
he
tries
to
kiss
me
too
know
says
the
third
who
was
the
only
pretty
girl
of
the
three
he
never
lays
a
finger
on
me
nor
speaks
a
word
to
me
good
or
bad
never
and
yesterday
he
lent
me
the
mysteries
of
udolpho
with
a
very
bad
grace
and
when
i
told
him
that
i
wanted
it
to
copy
the
description
of
the
tuscan
girl
dress
as
a
lady
had
ordered
me
to
make
up
a
dress
like
it
for
the
masquerade
he
handed
me
the
book
and
said
that
if
i
went
there
myself
the
people
would
take
my
face
for
a
mask
judge
of
my
horror
when
i
recollected
that
this
was
indeed
the
night
of
the
masquerade
and
that
i
was
pent
behind
a
curtain
without
even
a
dress
for
it
that
tuscan
costume
thought
i
would
just
answer
perhaps
i
could
purchase
it
from
the
milliner
perhaps
but
in
the
midst
of
my
perhaps
the
first
and
second
milliner
set
off
with
some
indian
robes
which
they
had
finished
for
the
masquerade
while
the
pretty
one
still
remained
to
complete
the
tuscan
dress
while
i
was
just
resolving
to
issue
from
my
retreat
and
persuade
her
to
sell
me
the
dress
i
heard
a
step
stealing
up
the
stairs
and
presently
perceived
a
young
gentleman
peeping
into
the
room
he
nodded
familiarly
to
the
milliner
and
said
in
a
whisper
that
he
had
seen
her
companions
depart
and
was
now
come
to
know
how
soon
she
would
go
that
he
might
meet
her
at
their
old
corner
she
replied
that
she
would
soon
be
ready
and
he
then
stole
back
again
i
had
now
no
time
to
lose
in
accomplishing
my
plan
so
i
drew
aside
the
curtain
and
stood
in
a
commanding
attitude
before
her
the
poor
girl
looked
up
started
made
a
miserable
imitation
of
the
heroic
scream
and
ran
down
stairs
i
ran
after
her
as
far
as
the
and
on
looking
over
the
balusters
into
the
hall
i
saw
the
young
man
who
had
just
been
with
her
listening
to
her
account
of
the
transaction
will
call
the
watch
said
she
do
you
keep
guard
at
the
door
she
then
hastened
into
the
street
and
he
stood
in
such
a
manner
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
pass
him
is
the
matter
cried
the
mistress
of
the
house
coming
out
of
the
parlour
mad
woman
that
is
above
stairs
answered
the
young
man
jane
has
just
seen
her
dressed
half
like
a
man
half
like
a
woman
and
with
hair
down
to
the
ground
is
all
this
cried
a
maid
running
out
of
the
kitchen
molly
said
the
mistress
jane
is
just
frightened
to
death
by
a
monster
above
stairs
half
man
half
woman
and
all
over
covered
with
hair
another
servant
now
made
her
appearance
betty
cried
molly
jane
is
just
killed
by
a
huge
monster
above
stairs
half
man
half
beast
all
over
covered
with
black
hair
and
i
do
know
what
other
devilments
besides
will
run
and
drive
it
down
cried
betty
and
began
ascending
the
stairs
whither
could
i
hide
i
luckily
recollected
the
large
chest
so
i
flew
up
to
the
garret
it
was
now
quite
dark
but
i
found
the
chest
sprang
into
it
and
having
closed
the
lid
flung
some
of
the
linen
over
me
i
then
heard
the
girl
enter
the
next
room
and
in
a
few
moments
she
came
into
mine
with
another
person
is
the
trunk
tom
said
she
i
must
lock
it
on
you
till
the
search
is
over
you
see
tom
what
risks
i
am
running
on
your
account
for
there
is
miss
jane
killed
by
it
and
lying
in
bits
all
about
the
floor
the
man
had
now
jumped
into
the
chest
the
girl
locked
it
in
an
instant
took
out
the
key
and
ran
down
almost
prest
to
death
i
made
a
sudden
effort
to
get
from
under
him
this
oh
mercy
what
this
cried
he
feeling
about
i
gathered
myself
up
but
did
not
speak
vociferated
he
the
monster
here
is
the
hair
help
help
said
i
you
will
betray
both
of
us
i
am
no
monster
but
a
woman
it
you
that
murdered
the
milliner
said
he
still
trembling
really
replied
i
now
not
a
word
for
i
hear
people
coming
as
i
spoke
several
persons
entered
the
room
we
lay
still
they
searched
about
and
one
of
them
approaching
the
chest
tried
to
lift
the
lid
is
locked
this
month
past
said
the
voice
of
the
maid
who
had
hidden
the
man
in
it
you
need
not
look
there
they
then
searched
the
remaining
garrets
and
i
heard
them
say
as
they
were
going
down
stairs
that
i
must
have
jumped
out
of
a
window
now
madam
said
the
man
you
have
the
goodness
to
tell
me
who
you
are
young
and
innocent
maiden
answered
i
flying
from
my
persecutors
took
refuge
here
and
innocent
cried
he
ingredients
faith
come
then
my
dear
i
will
protect
you
so
saying
he
caught
me
round
the
waist
and
attempted
to
kiss
me
i
begged
reasoned
menaced
all
would
not
do
i
had
read
of
a
heroine
whose
virtue
was
saved
by
a
timely
so
as
i
could
not
command
one
at
that
instant
i
determined
on
affecting
one
murdered
her
famously
exclaimed
i
and
then
commenced
singing
and
moaning
by
turns
he
stopped
and
lay
quiet
as
if
uncertain
what
to
make
of
me
i
scratched
the
chest
with
my
nails
and
laughed
and
shrieked
he
began
to
mutter
curses
and
prayers
with
great
rapidity
till
as
i
was
gabbling
over
the
finest
passage
in
ossian
merciful
ejaculated
he
rolling
himself
into
a
ball
a
bedlamite
broke
loose
by
this
time
between
my
terror
and
the
heat
of
the
chest
i
was
gasping
for
breath
and
my
companion
appeared
on
the
very
point
of
suffocation
when
at
this
critical
juncture
some
one
fortunately
came
into
the
room
the
man
called
for
help
the
chest
was
unlocked
opened
and
the
maid
with
a
candle
appeared
before
us
the
man
darted
out
like
an
arrow
she
remained
motionless
with
astonishment
at
seeing
me
while
i
lay
there
almost
exhausted
though
as
usual
not
worth
a
swoon
i
do
believe
that
the
five
fingers
i
am
writing
with
would
leave
me
sooner
than
my
five
senses
has
confessed
to
the
murder
cried
the
man
while
the
maid
held
by
his
arm
and
shrunk
back
as
i
rose
from
the
chest
with
an
air
of
dignity
not
frightened
my
friends
said
i
smiling
i
assure
you
that
i
am
no
murderess
and
that
the
milliner
is
alive
and
well
at
this
moment
is
she
not
young
woman
sure
answered
she
somewhat
recovering
from
her
terror
i
came
into
this
extraordinary
situation
continued
i
were
needless
to
relate
but
i
must
have
your
assistance
to
get
out
of
it
if
you
my
good
girl
will
supply
me
with
a
decent
gown
bonnet
and
pair
of
stockings
i
will
promise
not
to
tell
the
family
that
you
had
a
lover
secreted
in
the
house
and
i
will
give
you
two
guineas
for
your
kindness
so
saying
i
took
the
casket
from
the
pocket
of
my
regimental
coat
and
displayed
the
jewels
and
money
that
were
in
it
me
cried
the
maid
could
they
dare
for
to
say
that
so
rich
a
lady
murdered
the
girl
or
so
handsome
a
lady
added
the
man
bowing
in
a
word
after
some
explanations
and
compliments
i
gave
the
maid
four
guineas
and
the
man
the
regimental
coat
and
was
supplied
with
a
gown
bonnet
and
pair
of
stockings
as
soon
as
i
had
dressed
myself
we
determined
that
i
should
steal
down
stairs
and
out
of
the
house
and
that
if
discovered
in
my
passage
i
should
not
betray
the
maid
accordingly
with
much
trepidation
i
began
to
descend
the
stairs
not
a
soul
seemed
stirring
but
as
i
passed
by
the
milliner
room
i
perceived
the
door
half
open
and
heard
some
one
humming
a
tune
inside
i
peeped
through
the
chink
and
saw
the
pretty
milliner
again
seated
there
and
still
busied
about
the
tuscan
dress
i
resolved
to
make
another
effort
for
it
and
as
i
had
gained
my
point
with
the
maid
by
having
discovered
her
intrigue
it
struck
me
that
i
might
succeed
with
the
milliner
in
a
similar
manner
i
therefore
glided
into
the
room
and
seated
myself
just
opposite
to
her
business
said
she
looking
surprised
purchase
that
dress
answered
i
already
purchased
said
she
you
remember
the
mad
woman
with
the
long
hair
said
i
as
i
took
off
my
bonnet
and
let
down
my
tresses
with
all
the
grandeur
of
virtue
victorious
over
vice
she
started
and
turned
pale
are
the
very
person
i
believe
faltered
she
upon
earth
shall
i
do
cried
i
sell
me
the
tuscan
dress
of
course
the
fact
is
but
let
it
go
no
farther
i
am
a
heroine
i
am
i
give
you
my
word
and
honour
so
you
know
the
lady
being
wronged
of
the
dress
inasmuch
as
she
is
but
an
individual
is
as
nothing
compared
with
the
wrong
that
the
community
will
sustain
if
they
lose
the
pleasure
of
finding
that
i
get
it
from
you
sure
the
whole
scene
since
i
came
to
this
house
was
contrived
for
the
express
purpose
of
my
procuring
that
individual
costume
and
just
conceive
what
pretty
confusion
must
take
place
if
after
all
you
prevent
me
my
dear
girl
we
must
do
poetical
justice
we
must
not
disappoint
the
reader
will
tell
me
perhaps
that
selling
the
dress
is
improper
granted
but
recollect
what
improper
things
are
constantly
done
in
novels
to
bring
about
a
event
your
amour
with
the
gentleman
for
instance
which
i
shall
certainly
tell
your
employer
if
you
refuse
to
sell
me
the
dress
you
value
your
own
peace
of
mind
therefore
and
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
just
generous
and
honourable
i
conjure
you
to
reflect
for
a
moment
and
you
must
see
the
matter
in
its
rational
light
what
can
you
answer
to
these
arguments
the
person
who
could
use
them
said
she
never
listen
to
reason
i
see
what
is
the
matter
with
you
and
that
i
have
no
resource
but
to
humour
you
or
be
ruined
and
she
began
crying
to
conclude
after
a
little
farther
persuasion
i
got
the
dress
gave
her
ten
guineas
and
tripping
down
stairs
effected
a
safe
escape
out
of
the
house
i
then
called
a
coach
and
drove
to
jerry
sullivan
for
i
would
not
return
to
my
lodgings
lest
the
conspirators
there
should
prevent
me
from
going
to
the
masquerade
the
poor
fellow
jumped
with
joy
when
he
saw
me
but
i
found
him
in
great
distress
his
creditors
had
threatened
his
little
shop
with
immediate
ruin
unless
he
would
discharge
his
debts
he
had
now
provided
the
whole
sum
due
except
forty
pounds
but
this
he
could
not
procure
and
the
creditors
were
expected
every
minute
have
only
twelve
guineas
in
the
world
said
i
opening
my
casket
they
are
at
your
service
and
i
put
them
into
his
hand
lady
cried
the
wife
a
mortal
sight
of
jewels
you
have
got
do
you
know
now
i
could
borrow
thirty
pounds
at
least
on
them
at
the
pawnbroker
and
that
sum
would
just
answer
said
i
can
not
consent
to
part
with
them
though
had
i
thirty
pounds
i
would
sooner
give
it
to
you
than
buy
jewels
with
it
then
cried
she
the
same
rule
you
would
sooner
sell
your
jewels
than
let
me
want
thirty
pounds
at
all
answered
i
i
am
fond
of
my
jewels
and
i
do
not
care
about
money
besides
have
i
not
already
given
you
twelve
guineas
have
answered
she
that
is
what
vexes
me
if
you
had
given
me
nothing
at
all
i
would
not
have
minded
because
you
were
a
stranger
but
first
to
make
yourself
our
friend
by
giving
us
twelve
guineas
and
then
to
refuse
us
the
remainder
is
so
unnatural
woman
cried
i
i
ten
thousand
pounds
you
should
not
touch
a
farthing
of
it
the
arrival
of
the
creditors
interrupted
us
and
a
touching
scene
ensued
the
wife
and
daughter
flung
themselves
on
their
knees
and
wrung
their
hands
and
begged
for
mercy
but
the
wretches
were
inexorable
how
could
i
remain
unmoved
in
short
i
slipped
the
casket
into
the
wife
hand
out
she
ran
with
it
and
in
a
few
minutes
returned
with
forty
pounds
the
creditors
received
the
money
due
passed
receipts
and
departed
and
jerry
returned
me
the
twelve
guineas
saying
your
sweet
face
for
is
that
is
the
to
heaven
though
to
be
sure
i
ca
look
strait
in
it
after
all
you
have
done
for
me
och
is
a
murder
to
be
under
an
obligation
so
if
just
a
little
bit
of
mischief
would
happen
you
and
i
to
relieve
you
as
you
did
me
why
that
would
make
me
i
am
writing
to
you
from
his
house
while
his
daughter
is
finishing
the
sleeve
of
my
tuscan
dress
and
in
a
short
time
i
shall
be
ready
for
the
masquerade
i
confess
i
am
not
at
all
reconciled
to
the
means
i
used
in
obtaining
that
dress
i
took
advantage
of
the
milliner
indiscretion
in
one
instance
to
make
her
do
wrong
in
another
but
doubtless
my
biographer
will
find
excuses
for
me
which
i
can
not
discover
myself
besides
the
code
of
moral
law
that
heroines
acknowledge
is
often
quite
opposite
from
those
maxims
which
govern
other
conditions
of
life
and
indeed
if
we
view
the
various
ranks
and
departments
of
society
we
shall
see
that
what
is
considered
vicious
in
some
of
them
is
not
esteemed
so
in
others
thus
it
is
deemed
dishonest
in
a
servant
to
cheat
his
master
of
his
wines
but
it
is
thought
perfectly
fair
for
his
master
to
defraud
the
king
of
the
revenue
from
those
wines
in
the
same
way
what
is
called
wantonness
in
a
little
minx
with
a
flat
face
is
called
only
susceptibility
in
a
heroine
with
an
oval
one
we
weep
at
the
letters
of
heloise
but
were
they
written
by
an
alderman
fat
wife
we
should
laugh
at
them
the
heroine
may
permit
an
amorous
arm
round
her
waist
fly
in
the
face
of
her
parents
and
make
assignations
in
dark
groves
yet
still
be
described
as
the
most
prudent
of
human
creatures
but
the
mere
miss
has
no
business
to
attempt
any
mode
of
conduct
beyond
modesty
decorum
and
filial
obedience
in
a
word
as
different
classes
have
distinct
privileges
it
appears
to
me
from
what
i
have
read
of
the
law
national
and
the
law
romantic
that
the
heroine
prerogative
is
similar
to
the
king
and
that
she
like
him
can
do
no
wrong
adieu
letter
xxi
o
biddy
i
have
ascertained
my
genealogy
i
am
but
i
must
not
anticipate
take
the
particulars
having
secured
a
comfortable
bed
at
jerry
and
eaten
something
for
i
had
fasted
all
day
i
went
with
him
in
a
coach
to
the
pantheon
where
he
promised
to
remain
and
escort
me
back
but
i
must
first
describe
my
tuscan
dress
it
was
a
short
petticoat
of
pale
green
with
a
bodice
of
white
silk
the
sleeves
loose
and
tied
up
at
the
shoulders
with
ribbons
and
bunches
of
flowers
my
hair
which
fell
in
ringlets
on
my
neck
was
also
ornamented
with
flowers
and
a
straw
hat
i
wore
no
mask
heroines
so
seldom
do
palpitating
with
expectation
i
entered
the
assembly
such
a
multitude
of
grotesque
groups
as
presented
themselves
clowns
harlequins
nuns
devils
all
talking
and
none
listening
the
clowns
happy
to
be
called
fools
the
harlequins
as
awkward
as
clowns
the
nuns
impudent
and
the
devils
but
as
there
is
a
description
of
a
masquerade
in
almost
every
novel
you
will
excuse
me
from
entering
into
farther
particulars
too
much
agitated
to
support
my
character
with
spirit
i
retired
to
a
recess
and
there
anxiously
awaited
the
arrival
of
the
ancient
vassal
hardly
had
i
been
seated
five
minutes
when
an
infirm
and
reverend
old
man
approached
and
sat
down
beside
me
his
feeble
form
was
propt
upon
a
long
staff
a
palsy
shook
his
white
locks
and
his
garments
had
all
the
quaintness
of
antiquity
during
some
minutes
he
gazed
on
me
with
earnestness
through
a
black
mask
at
length
heaving
a
heavy
sigh
he
thus
broke
forth
in
tremulous
accents
how
the
scalding
tears
do
run
adown
my
furrowed
cheeks
for
well
i
wis
thou
beest
herself
the
lady
cherubina
de

the
daughter
of
mine
honoured
mistress

he
will
say
forth
my
say
my
name
is
whylome
eftsoones
and
i
was
accounted
comely
when
a
younker
but
what
boots
that
now
beauty
is
like
unto
a
flower
of
the
good
my
lady
pardon
a
garrulous
old
man
so
as
i
was
saying
the
damozels
were
once
wont
to
leer
at
me
right
waggishly
but
time
changeth
all
things
as
the
proverb
saith
and
time
hath
changed
my
face
from
that
of
a
blithesome
ganymede
to
one
of
those
heads
which
guido
has
often
painted
mild
pale
penetrating
good
my
lady
i
must
tell
thee
a
right
pleasant
and
quaint
saying
of
a
certain
nun
touching
my
face

sake
cried
i
as

value
the
preservation
of
my
senses

to
thine
honoured
fader
lord
de

married
the
lady

and
thou
wast
the
sole
offspring
of

union
after
thy
birth

noble
father
died
of
an
apparition
or
as
some
will
have
it
of
stewed
lampreys
returning
impierced
with
mickle
dolour
from
his
funeral
which
took
place
at
midnight
i
was
stopped
on
a
common
by
a
tall
figure
with
a
mirksome
cloak
and
a
flapped
hat
i
shook
grievously
ne
in
that
ghastly
dreriment
wist
how
myself
to
bear

not
comprehend
your
expressions

he
was
in

a

i

then
put
into
mine
hand
a
stiletto

he
with
a
hollow
voice
if
this
dagger
be
planted
in
a
child
heart
it
will
grow
and
bear
a
golden
flower
spake
and
incontinently
took
to
striding
away
from

in
such
wise
that
maulgre
and
albe
i
gan
make
effort
after
him
nathlesse
and

did
child
gwyn
forthwith
flee
from
mine
eyne
protest
most
solemnly
said
i
do
not
understand
five
words
in
the
whole
of
that
last
sentence
yet
my
lady
replied
he
the
pure
well
of
english
undefiled
and
such
as
was
yspoken
in
mine
youth
what
can
you
mean
by
gwyn
said
i
his
lordship
was
no
suckling
at
this
time
said
eftsoones
a
noble
youth
some
centuries
ago
and
it
is
coming
into
fashion
again
for
instance
there
is
childe
harold
said
i
is
second
childishness
and
i
fancy
there
will
be
mere
oblivion
too
but
if
possible
finish
your
tale
in
the
corrupt
tongue
will
endeavour
said
he
by
this
implied
promise
of
a
reward
i
took
an
opportunity
of
conveying
you
away
from
your
mother
and
of
secreting
you
at
the
house
of
a
peasant
whom
i
bribed
to
bring
you
up
as
his
own
daughter
i
told
lord
gwyn
that
i
had
dispatched
you
and
he
gave
me
three
and
fourpence
halfpenny
for
my
trouble
the
dear
lady
your
mother
missed
you
she
went
through
the
most
elegant
extravagancies
till
having
plucked
the
last
hair
from
her
head
she
ran
wild
into
the
woods
and
has
never
been
heard
of
since
sainted
sufferer
exclaimed
i
few
days
ago
continued
eftsoones
messenger
out
of
breath
came
to
tell
me
that
the
peasant
to
whom
i
had
consigned
you
was
dying
and
wished
to
see
me
i
went
such
a
scene
he
confessed
to
me
that
he
had
sold
you
body
and
bones
as
he
inelegantly
expressed
it
to
one
farmer
wilkinson
about
thirteen
years
before
for
that
this
farmer
having
discovered
your
illustrious
birth
speculated
on
a
handsome
consideration
from
lord
gwyn
for
keeping
the
secret
now
i
am
told
there
is
a
certain
parchment
i
have
cried
i
a
certain
portrait
of
nell
gwyn
i
have
a
mole
just
above
your
left
temple
i
have
exclaimed
i
in
an
ecstasy
your
title
is
made
out
as
clear
as
the
sun
said
he
i
bow
in
contrition
before
lady
cherubina
de
willoughby
rightful
heiress
of
all
the
territory
now
appertaining
or
that
may
hereinafter
appertain
to
the
house
of
de
willoughby
dear
how
delightful
cried
i
my
good
friend
how
am
i
to
set
about
proving
my
title
easier
answered
he
gwyn
for
his
lordship
is
dead
resides
at
this
moment
on
your
estate
which
lies
about
thirty
miles
from
town
so
morning
you
shall
set
off
to
see
her
ladyship
and
make
your
claims
known
to
her
i
will
send
a
trusty
servant
with
you
and
will
myself
proceed
before
you
to
prepare
her
for
your
arrival
you
will
therefore
find
me
there
while
we
were
in
the
act
of
arranging
affairs
more
accurately
who
should
make
his
appearance
but
stuart
in
a
domino
the
moment
he
addressed
me
old
eftsoones
slunk
away
nor
could
i
catch
another
glimpse
of
him
during
that
night
stuart
told
me
that
he
had
come
to
the
masquerade
on
the
chance
of
finding
me
there
as
i
seemed
so
determined
on
going
the
last
time
he
was
with
me
he
likewise
explained
the
mystery
of
the
darkened
chamber
and
the
false
alarm
of
fire
it
appears
that
as
soon
as
he
had
discovered
the
views
of
betterton
he
hired
a
lodging
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
and
had
two
police
officers
there
for
the
purpose
of
watching
movements
and
frustrating
his
attempts
he
knocked
several
times
in
the
course
of
yesterday
but
was
always
answered
that
i
had
walked
out
knowing
that
i
had
not
he
began
to
suspect
foul
play
and
determined
on
gaining
admittance
to
me
he
therefore
knocked
once
more
and
then
rushed
into
the
house
crying
fire
this
manoeuvre
had
the
desired
effect
for
an
universal
panic
took
place
and
in
the
midst
of
it
he
saw
me
issuing
forth
and
effect
my
escape
after
having
pursued
me
till
he
lost
all
traces
of
my
route
he
returned
to
my
lodgings
and
was
informed
by
the
poet
that
betterton
had
persuaded
the
landlady
to
fasten
a
carpet
at
the
outside
of
my
window
in
order
to
make
me
remain
in
bed
till
the
time
for
the
masquerade
should
arrive
and
thus
prevent
me
from
having
an
interview
with
stuart
we
then
walked
up
and
down
the
room
while
i
gave
him
an
account
of
the
ancient
and
loyal
vassal
and
of
all
that
i
had
heard
respecting
my
family
he
was
silent
on
the
subject
and
only
begged
of
me
to
point
out
eftsoones
as
soon
as
i
should
see
him
but
that
interesting
old
man
never
appeared
however
i
was
in
great
hopes
of
another
adventure
for
a
domino
now
began
hovering
about
us
so
much
that
stuart
at
last
addressed
it
but
it
glided
away
he
said
he
knew
it
was
betterton
in
about
an
hour
i
became
tired
of
the
scene
for
no
one
took
notice
of
my
dress
we
therefore
bade
jerry
who
was
in
waiting
call
a
coach
and
we
proceeded
in
it
to
his
house
on
our
way
i
mentioned
my
determination
of
setting
off
to
lady
the
very
next
morning
as
eftsoones
had
promised
to
meet
me
there
stuart
for
a
wonder
applauded
my
resolution
and
even
offered
to
accompany
me
himself
said
he
think
i
know
this
old
eftsoones
and
if
so
i
fancy
you
will
find
me
useful
in
unravelling
part
of
the
mystery
besides
i
would
assist
with
all
my
soul
in
any
plan
tending
to
withdraw
you
from
the
metropolis
i
snatched
at
his
offer
with
joy
and
it
was
then
fixed
that
we
should
take
a
chaise
the
next
morning
and
go
together
on
our
arrival
at
the
lodging
stuart
begged
a
bed
of
jerry
that
he
might
be
ready
for
the
journey
in
time
and
the
irishman
finding
him
my
friend
agreed
to
make
up
a
pallet
for
him
in
the
parlour
matters
were
soon
arranged
and
we
have
just
separated
for
the
night
well
biddy
what
say
you
now
have
i
not
made
a
glorious
expedition
of
it
a
young
rich
beautiful
titled
heiress
already
think
of
that
biddy
as
soon
as
i
can
decently
turn
lady
gwyn
out
of
doors
i
mean
to
set
up
a
most
magnificent
establishment
but
i
will
treat
the
poor
woman
who
perhaps
is
innocent
of
her
husband
crime
with
extreme
delicacy
she
shall
never
want
a
bed
or
a
plate
by
the
by
i
must
purchase
silver
plate
my
livery
shall
be
white
and
crimson
biddy
depend
upon
my
patronage
how
the
parson
and
will
boast
of
having
known
me
then
our
village
will
swarm
so
hear
tell
as
miss
cherry
has
grown
a
great
lady
old
mother
muggins
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
will
make
a
good
week
gossip
out
of
it
however
i
mean
to
condescend
excessively
for
there
is
nothing
i
hate
so
much
as
pride
yet
do
not
suppose
that
i
am
speculating
upon
an
easy
life
though
the
chief
obstacle
to
my
marriage
will
soon
be
removed
by
the
confirmation
of
my
noble
birth
still
i
am
not
ignorant
enough
to
imagine
that
no
other
impediments
will
interfere
besides
to
confess
the
fact
i
do
not
feel
my
mind
quite
prepared
to
marry
montmorenci
at
so
short
a
notice
hitherto
i
have
thought
of
him
but
as
a
lover
not
as
a
husband
very
different
characters
in
general
ah
no
my
friend
be
well
assured
that
adversity
will
not
desert
me
quite
so
quickly
a
present
good
is
often
the
prognostic
of
an
approaching
evil
and
when
prosperity
points
its
sunshine
in
our
faces
misfortune
like
our
shadows
is
sure
to
be
behind
adieu
letter
xxii
after
having
breakfasted
and
remunerated
our
entertainers
stuart
and
i
set
out
in
a
while
jerry
ran
at
our
side
half
way
down
the
street
heaping
me
with
blessings
and
bidding
me
come
to
him
if
ever
i
should
be
ruined
after
we
had
advanced
a
few
miles
into
the
country
stuart
began
to
look
frequently
through
the
back
window
and
appeared
uneasy
at
length
he
stopped
the
carriage
and
desired
the
driver
to
turn
round
as
soon
as
the
man
had
done
so
another
carriage
which
it
seems
had
followed
us
from
london
passed
us
and
immediately
turned
after
us
as
i
thought
cried
stuart
and
stopping
the
chaise
again
jumped
out
of
it
the
chaise
behind
us
also
stopped
and
a
gentleman
alighted
from
it
and
approached
but
imagine
my
surprise
when
i
found
that
this
gentleman
was
old
betterton
i
could
almost
have
embraced
him
his
villainous
face
looked
so
promising
and
so
pregnant
with
mischief
said
he
to
stuart
you
have
perceived
me
following
your
carriage
i
find
myself
compelled
however
unwillingly
to
declare
my
motives
for
doing
so
last
night
i
happened
to
be
at
the
pantheon
in
a
domino
and
saw
you
there
escorting
this
lady
i
confess
i
had
long
before
suspected
your
intentions
towards
her
and
seeing
you
now
together
at
a
masquerade
and
without
a
matron
i
did
not
feel
my
suspicions
lessened
i
therefore
had
you
both
traced
home
and
i
found
to
my
great
horror
that
you
stopped
at
a
wretched
and
as
i
am
informed
infamous
house
in
giles
where
you
remained
during
the
night
i
found
too
that
a
chaise
was
at
the
door
of
it
this
morning
whence
concluding
as
i
well
might
that
an
elopement
was
in
agitation
i
determined
if
possible
to
prevent
so
dreadful
a
catastrophe
by
hiring
a
carriage
and
pursuing
you
you
undertook
to
lecture
me
when
last
i
saw
you
and
plausibly
enough
you
performed
your
part
it
is
now
my
duty
to
return
the
obligation
stuart
stuart
is
it
not
a
shame
for
you
stuart
is
this
the
way
to
treat
the
daughter
of
your
friend
stuart
go
silly
boy
return
to
your
home
and
bless
that
heaven
which
hath
sent
me
to
the
rescue
of
this
fair
unfortunate
all
that
is
comical
cried
stuart
laughing
immoderately
is
too
ludicrous
even
to
be
angry
at
miss
wilkinson
allow
me
to
introduce
you
to
whylome
eftsoones
an
ancient
and
loyal
vassal
of
the
de
willoughbys
a
mere
modern
in
his
principles
i
am
afraid
but
addicted
i
wis
to
antiquated
language
betterton
i
thought
looked
rather
blank
as
he
said
sir
i
do
not
understand
really
sir
cried
stuart
understand
i
understand
that
if
you
would
take
less
trouble
in
protecting
this
lady
honour
you
would
have
a
better
chance
of
preserving
your
own
answered
betterton
will
have
you
to
know
that
i
would
sacrifice
my
life
in
defence
of
my
honour
then
said
stuart
your
life
has
but
little
of
the
saint
it
will
at
least
have
something
of
the
martyr
betterton
scowled
at
him
askance
and
grinned
a
thousand
devils
me
gentlemen
cried
i
either
of
you
again
say
any
thing
disrespectful
or
insulting
to
the
other
i
declare
on
my
honour
he
shall
leave
me
instantly
at
present
i
should
be
happy
if
both
would
do
me
the
favour
of
escorting
me
to
lady
gwyn
as
i
may
meet
with
treatment
there
that
will
render
the
support
of
friends
indispensible
it
was
now
stuart
turn
to
look
downcast
and
betterton
to
smile
triumphant
the
fact
is
i
wished
to
shew
this
admirable
villain
how
grateful
i
felt
for
his
meritorious
conduct
in
not
having
deserted
me
will
accept
of
your
invitation
with
pleasure
said
he
my
seat
lies
within
a
few
miles
of
her
ladyship
and
i
wish
to
visit
my
tenantry
it
was
now
noon
a
few
fleecy
clouds
floated
in
the
blue
depths
of
ether
the
breeze
brought
coolness
on
its
wings
and
an
inviting
valley
watered
by
a
rivulet
lay
on
the
left
here
whitened
with
sheep
and
there
dotted
with
little
encampments
of
hay
exhilarated
by
the
scene
after
so
long
a
confinement
in
the
smoke
and
stir
of
london
i
proposed
to
my
companions
the
rural
exercise
of
walking
as
preferable
to
proceeding
cooped
up
in
a
carriage
each
whatever
was
his
motive
caught
at
the
proposal
with
delight
and
we
dismissed
our
chaises
i
now
hastened
to
luxuriate
in
arcadian
beatitude
the
pastoral
habit
of
tuscany
was
favourable
nothing
remained
but
to
rival
an
ida
or
a
glorvina
in
simple
touches
of
nature
and
to
trip
along
the
lawns
like
a
daphne
or
a
hamadryad
in
an
instant
i
sprang
across
a
hedge
and
fled
towards
the
little
valley
light
as
a
flying
from
a
satyr
i
then
took
up
a
most
picturesque
position
it
was
beside
of
the
streamlet
under
a
weeping
willow
and
on
a
grassy
bank
close
behind
me
lay
one
of
the
most
romantic
cottages
that
i
had
ever
seen
and
at
its
back
was
a
small
garden
encompassed
by
green
paling
the
stream
bordered
with
prattled
prettily
save
here
and
there
where
a
jutting
stone
shattered
its
crystal
and
made
its
music
hoarse
it
purled
and
murmured
a
little
too
but
no
where
could
it
be
said
either
to
tinkle
or
gurgle
to
chide
or
brawl
flinging
off
my
bonnet
i
shook
my
narcissine
locks
over
my
shoulders
and
began
braiding
them
in
the
manner
of
a
simple
shepherdess
stuart
came
up
the
first
i
plucked
a
daisy
that
was
half
dipt
into
the
brook
and
instead
of
shaking
off
its
moisture
i
quaffed
the
liquid
fragrance
with
my
lip
and
then
held
the
flower
to
him
am
i
to
do
with
it
said
he
pledge
me
replied
i
drink
nature
nectar
that
trembles
on
the
leaves
which
my
lip
has
consecrated
he
laughed
and
kissed
the
flower
that
moment
a
lambkin
began
its
pretty
bleat
said
i
me
a
simple
tripping
little
ditty
on
a
lambkin
shall
have
it
answered
he
such
as
an
attorney
clerk
would
read
to
a
milliner
apprentice
dear
sensibility
o
la
i
heard
a
little
lamb
cry
ba
says
i
so
you
have
lost
mamma
ah
the
little
lamb
as
i
said
so
frisking
about
the
field
did
go
and
frisking
trod
upon
my
toe
oh
enough
said
i
that
it
wants
the
word
love
in
it
cried
stuart
all
modern
poems
of
the
kind
abound
in
the
word
though
they
seldom
have
much
of
the
feeling
pray
my
good
friend
asked
i
archly
as
i
bound
up
my
golden
ringlets
is
love
said
he
say
that
talking
of
love
is
making
it
plucking
a
thistle
that
sprang
from
the
bank
i
blew
away
its
down
with
my
balmy
breath
merely
to
hide
my
confusion
surely
i
am
the
most
sensitive
of
all
created
beings
betterton
had
now
reached
us
out
of
breath
after
his
race
and
utterly
unable
to
articulate
cried
i
is
love
said
he
gasping
is
gentleman
cried
stuart
as
good
a
description
of
it
as
most
of
our
modern
poets
who
make
its
chief
ingredients
panting
and
broken
murmurs
in
my
opinion
said
i
is
a
mystical
sympathy
which
unfolds
itself
in
the
glance
that
seeks
the
soul
the
sentiment
that
the
soul
embodies
the
tender
gaiety
the
more
delicious
sadness
the
stifled
sigh
the
soft
and
malicious
smile
the
thrill
the
hope
the
fear
each
in
itself
a
little
bliss
in
a
word
it
is
the
swoon
of
the
soul
the
delirium
of
the
heart
the
elegant
inebriety
of
unsophisticated
sentiment
such
be
love
said
stuart
fear
i
shall
never
bring
myself
to
make
it
pray
said
i
would
you
make
love
are
many
modes
answered
he
the
way
to
succeed
with
one
girl
is
often
the
way
to
fail
with
another
girls
may
be
divided
into
the
conversable
and
inconversable
he
who
can
talk
the
best
has
therefore
the
best
chance
of
the
former
but
would
a
man
make
a
conquest
of
one
of
the
beautiful
inutilities
who
sits
in
sweet
stupidity
plays
off
the
small
simpers
and
founds
her
prospects
in
life
on
the
shape
of
her
face
he
has
little
more
to
do
than
call
her
a
goddess
and
make
himself
a
monkey
or
if
that
should
fail
as
he
can
not
apply
to
her
understanding
he
must
have
recourse
to
her
feeling
and
try
what
the
touch
can
do
for
him
the
touch
has
a
thousand
virtues
only
let
him
establish
a
lodgment
on
the
first
joint
of
her
little
finger
he
may
soon
set
out
on
his
travels
and
make
the
grand
tour
of
her
waist
this
is
indeed
to
have
wit
at
his
fingers
ends
and
this
i
can
assure
you
is
the
best
and
shortest
way
to
gain
the
hearts
of
those
demure
misses
who
think
that
all
modesty
consists
in
silence
that
to
be
insipid
is
to
be
innocent
and
that
because
they
have
not
a
word
for
a
young
man
in
public
they
may
have
a
kiss
for
him
in
private
said
i
us
talk
of
love
in
poetry
not
prose
i
want
some
pretty
verses
to
fill
up
my
memoirs
so
betterton
now
for
an
amorous
ode
to
your
mistress
betterton
bowed
and
began
to
fanny
say
fanny
why
has
bounteous
heaven
in
every
end
benign
and
wise
perfection
to
your
features
given
enchantment
to
your
witching
eyes
was
it
that
mortal
man
might
view
thy
charms
at
distance
and
adore
ah
no
the
man
who
would
not
woo
were
less
than
mortal
or
were
more
the
mossy
rose
that
scents
the
sky
by
bee
by
butterfly
caress
we
leave
not
on
the
stalk
to
die
but
fondly
snatch
it
to
the
breast
there
unsurpassed
in
sweets
it
dwells
unless
the
breast
be
fanny
own
there
blooming
every
bloom
excels
except
of
fanny
blush
alone
o
fanny
life
is
on
the
wing
and
years
like
rivers
glide
away
may
misfortune
bring
then
gentle
girl
enjoy
and
while
a
lingering
kiss
i
sip
ah
start
not
from
these
ardent
arms
nor
think
the
printure
of
my
lip
will
rob
your
own
of
any
charms
for
see
we
crush
not
though
we
tread
the
cup
and
primrose
fanny
smiled
come
then
and
press
the
cup
she
said
come
then
and
press
the
primrose
wild
cried
stuart
can
give
you
a
poem
with
just
as
much
love
in
it
and
twice
as
much
kissing
said
i
be
a
treasure
indeed
he
then
began
thus
to
sally
dawn
with
stains
of
ruddy
light
streaks
her
grey
and
fragrant
fingers
while
the
ethiop
foot
of
night
envious
of
my
sally
lingers
upward
poplars
downward
willows
rustle
round
us
zephyrs
sprinkle
leaves
of
daffodillies
lilies
pennyroyal
periwinkle
rosy
balmy
honied
humid
biting
burning
murmuring
kisses
sally
i
will
snatch
from
you
mid
looks
demure
that
tempt
to
blisses
if
your
cheek
grow
cold
my
dear
i
will
kiss
it
till
it
flushes
or
if
warm
my
raptured
tear
shall
extinguish
all
its
blushes
yes
that
dimple
is
a
valley
where
sports
many
a
little
true
love
and
that
glance
you
dart
my
sally
might
melt
diamonds
into
dew
love
but
while
idle
thus
i
chat
i
the
war
of
lips
am
missing
this
this
this
and
that
that
that
these
make
kissing
kissing
kissing
the
style
of
this
poem
reminded
me
of
montmorenci
and
at
the
same
moment
i
heard
a
rustling
sound
behind
me
i
started
montmorenci
cried
agitated
in
the
extreme
i
turned
to
it
was
only
a
deserve
the
disappointment
said
i
to
myself
i
have
never
once
thought
of
that
amiable
youth
since
i
last
beheld
him
and
noblest
of
men
exclaimed
i
aloud
dost
thou
mourn
my
mysterious
absence
perhaps
the
draught
of
air
that
i
now
inhale
is
the
same
which
thou
hast
breathed
forth
in
a
sigh
for
the
far
distant
cherubina
can
not
well
be
interrupted
stuart
at
least
the
sigh
of
this
unknown
must
have
been
packed
up
in
a
case
and
hermetically
sealed
to
have
come
to
you
without
being
dispersed
on
the
way
you
happen
to
be
mistaken
answered
i
in
the
hermit
of
the
rock
the
heroine
while
sitting
on
the
coast
of
sardinia
seemed
to
think
it
highly
probable
that
the
billow
at
her
feet
might
be
the
identical
billow
which
had
swallowed
up
her
lover
about
a
year
before
off
the
coast
of
martinique
was
not
at
all
more
improbable
than
valancourt
theory
said
stuart
was
it
asked
i
said
he
the
sun
sets
in
different
longitudes
at
the
same
moment
for
when
his
emily
was
going
to
italy
while
he
remained
in
france
he
begged
of
her
to
watch
the
setting
of
the
sun
every
evening
that
both
their
eyes
might
be
fixed
upon
the
same
object
at
once
now
as
the
sun
would
set
where
she
was
in
italy
much
earlier
than
where
he
was
in
france
he
certainly
took
the
best
of
all
possible
methods
to
prevent
their
looking
at
it
together
sir
said
betterton
and
heroines
are
not
bound
to
understand
astronomy
yet
answered
stuart
are
greater
than
the
ancient
egyptians
to
form
an
attachment
for
the
moon
and
write
a
sonnet
on
it
is
the
principal
test
of
being
a
heroine
as
he
spoke
a
painted
butterfly
came
fluttering
about
me
to
pursue
it
was
a
classical
amusement
for
caroline
of
lichfield
made
a
her
pastime
so
springing
on
my
feet
i
began
the
chace
the
nimble
insect
eluded
me
for
a
long
time
and
at
last
got
over
the
paling
into
the
little
garden
i
followed
it
through
a
small
gate
and
caught
it
but
alas
bruised
it
in
the
capture
and
broke
one
of
its
wings
the
poor
thing
sought
refuge
in
a
lily
where
it
lay
struggling
a
few
moments
and
then
its
little
spirit
fled
for
ever
what
an
opportunity
for
a
sonnet
i
determined
to
compose
one
under
the
willow
a
beautiful
was
blushing
near
the
lily
and
reminded
me
how
pastoral
i
should
look
could
i
recline
on
roses
during
my
poetical
ecstasy
but
would
it
be
proper
to
pick
them
surely
a
few
could
do
no
harm
i
glanced
round
nobody
was
in
sight
i
picked
a
few
but
what
signified
a
few
for
what
i
wanted
i
picked
a
few
more
the
more
i
picked
the
more
i
longed
to
pick
is
human
nature
and
was
not
eve
herself
tempted
in
a
garden
so
from
roses
i
went
to
lilies
from
lilies
to
carnations
thence
to
jessamine
eglantine
till
in
short
i
had
filled
my
bonnet
and
almost
emptied
the
beds
i
then
hurried
to
the
willow
with
my
prize
sentenced
stuart
and
betterton
to
fifty
yards
banishment
and
constructed
a
charming
couch
of
flowers
which
i
damasked
and
inlaid
with
daisies
and
moss
enraptured
with
my
paradisaical
carpet
i
flung
myself
upon
it
and
my
recumbent
form
as
it
pressed
the
perfumes
was
indeed
that
of
mahomet
houri
exercise
and
agitation
had
heightened
the
glow
of
my
cheeks
and
the
wind
had
blown
my
yellow
hair
about
my
face
like
withered
leaves
round
a
ripened
peach
i
never
looked
so
lovely
in
a
short
time
i
was
able
to
repeat
this
sonnet
aloud
sonnet
where
the
blue
stream
reflected
flowerets
pale
a
fluttering
butterfly
with
many
a
freak
dipped
into
dancing
bells
and
spread
its
sail
of
azure
pinions
edged
with
jetty
streak
i
snatched
it
passing
but
a
pinion
frail
ingrained
with
mealy
gold
i
chanced
to
break
the
mangled
insect
ill
deserving
bane
falls
in
the
hollow
of
a
lily
new
my
tears
drop
after
it
but
drop
in
vain
the
cup
embalmed
with
azure
airs
and
dew
and
flowery
dust
and
grains
of
fragrant
seed
can
revive
it
from
the
fatal
deed
so
guileless
nymphs
attract
some
traiterous
eye
so
by
the
spoiler
crushed
reject
all
joy
and
die
now
that
the
pomp
of
composition
was
over
i
began
to
think
i
had
treated
the
owner
of
the
garden
extremely
ill
i
felt
myself
guilty
of
little
less
than
theft
and
was
deliberating
on
what
i
ought
to
do
when
an
old
peasant
came
running
towards
me
from
the
garden
cried
he
you
seen
any
body
pass
this
way
with
a
parcel
of
flowers
for
some
confounded
thief
has
just
robbed
me
of
all
i
had
i
raised
myself
a
little
to
reply
and
he
perceived
the
flowers
underneath
life
cried
he
you
are
the
thief
are
you
how
dare
you
hussey
commit
such
a
robbery
am
no
hussey
and
is
no
robbery
cried
i
trust
me
you
shall
neither
have
apology
nor
compensation
hussey
indeed
sir
it
was
all
your
own
fault
for
leaving
that
uncouth
gate
of
your
open
i
am
afraid
sir
that
you
are
a
shockingly
ignorant
old
man
the
peasant
was
just
about
to
seize
me
when
stuart
ran
up
and
prevented
him
they
had
then
some
private
conversation
together
and
i
saw
stuart
give
him
a
guinea
the
talismanic
touch
of
gold
struck
instant
peace
and
a
compact
of
amity
followed
indeed
i
have
ever
found
that
even
my
face
though
a
heroine
and
with
all
its
dimples
blushes
and
glances
could
never
do
half
so
much
for
me
as
the
royal
face
on
a
bit
of
gold
the
peasant
was
now
very
civil
and
invited
us
to
rest
in
his
cottage
thither
we
repaired
and
found
his
daughter
a
beautiful
young
woman
just
preparing
the
dinner
i
felt
instantly
interested
in
her
fate
i
likewise
felt
hungry
so
calling
her
aside
i
told
her
that
i
would
be
happy
to
have
a
dinner
and
if
possible
a
bed
at
the
cottage
and
that
i
would
recompense
her
liberally
for
them
as
i
was
a
lady
of
rank
but
at
present
in
great
affliction
she
said
she
would
be
very
glad
to
accommodate
me
if
her
father
would
permit
her
and
she
then
went
to
consult
him
after
a
private
conference
between
them
and
stuart
she
told
me
that
her
father
was
willing
to
let
me
remain
so
we
soon
agreed
upon
the
terms
and
a
village
was
at
hand
where
stuart
and
betterton
might
dine
and
sleep
before
they
left
me
they
made
me
give
a
solemn
promise
not
to
quit
the
cottage
till
both
of
them
should
return
the
next
morning
stuart
took
an
opportunity
of
asking
me
whether
he
could
speak
to
me
in
private
that
evening
ten
answered
i
will
be
sitting
at
the
casement
of
my
chamber
trill
a
lamenting
canzonet
beneath
it
as
a
signal
and
i
will
admit
you
to
a
stolen
interview
betterton
and
he
then
departed
but
not
in
company
with
each
other
dinner
is
announced
adieu
letter
xxiii
at
dinner
a
young
farmer
joined
us
and
i
soon
perceived
that
he
and
the
peasant
daughter
mary
were
born
for
each
other
they
betrayed
their
mutual
tenderness
by
a
thousand
little
innocent
stratagems
that
passed
as
they
thought
unobserved
after
dinner
when
mary
was
about
accompanying
me
to
walk
the
youth
stole
after
us
and
just
as
i
had
got
into
the
garden
he
drew
her
back
and
i
heard
him
kiss
her
she
came
to
me
with
her
face
a
little
flushed
and
her
ripe
lips
ruddier
than
before
mary
said
i
was
he
doing
to
you
nothing
i
am
sure
mary
he
only
wanted
to
be
a
little
rude
and
kiss
me
i
believe
you
would
not
allow
him
mary
should
i
tell
a
falsehood
about
it
said
she
be
sure
i
did
not
hinder
him
for
he
is
my
sweetheart
and
we
are
to
be
married
next
week
do
you
love
him
mary
than
my
life
there
never
was
such
a
good
lad
he
has
not
a
fault
in
the
wide
world
and
all
the
girls
are
dying
of
envy
that
i
have
got
him
mary
said
i
foresee
we
shall
spend
a
most
delicious
evening
we
will
take
a
rural
repast
down
to
the
brook
and
tell
our
loves
the
contrast
will
be
beautiful
mine
the
refined
sentimental
pathetic
story
your
the
pretty
simple
little
artless
tale
come
my
friend
let
us
return
and
prepare
the
rustic
banquet
no
souchong
or
bohea
blessed
names
these
no
hot
or
cold
cakes
oh
no
but
creams
berries
and
fruits
goat
milk
figs
and
honey
arcadian
pastoral
primeval
dainties
we
then
went
back
to
the
cottage
but
could
get
nothing
better
than
currants
gooseberries
and
a
maple
bowl
of
cream
mary
indeed
cut
a
large
slice
of
bread
and
butter
for
her
private
amusement
and
with
these
we
returned
to
the
streamlet
i
then
threw
myself
on
my
flowery
couch
and
my
companion
sat
beside
me
we
helped
ourselves
i
took
rivulet
to
my
cream
and
scooped
the
brook
with
my
rosy
palm
innocent
nymph
ah
why
couldst
thou
not
sit
down
in
the
lap
of
content
here
and
dance
and
sing
and
say
thy
prayers
and
go
to
heaven
with
this
maid
i
picked
up
a
languishing
rose
and
sighed
as
i
inhaled
its
perfume
and
gazed
on
its
decay
mary
said
i
will
be
the
fate
of
you
and
me
how
soft
how
serene
this
evening
it
is
a
landscape
for
a
claud
but
how
much
more
charming
is
an
italian
or
a
french
than
an
english
landscape
o
to
saunter
over
hillocks
covered
with
lavender
wild
thyme
juniper
and
tamarise
while
shrubs
fringe
the
summits
of
the
rocks
or
patches
of
meagre
vegetation
tint
their
recesses
plantations
of
almonds
cypresses
palms
olives
and
dates
stretch
along
nor
are
the
larch
and
ilex
the
masses
of
granite
and
dark
forests
of
fir
wanting
while
the
majestic
garonne
wanders
descending
from
the
pyrenees
and
winding
its
blue
waves
towards
the
bay
of
biscay
not
all
this
exquisite
mary
must
since
you
say
so
replied
she
continued
i
your
own
cottage
is
tolerable
yet
is
it
as
in
italy
covered
with
vine
leaves
jessamine
and
clusters
of
grapes
is
it
tufted
with
myrtle
or
shaded
with
a
grove
of
lemon
orange
and
bergamot
said
mary
shaded
by
some
fine
old
elms
cried
i
with
the
smile
of
approaching
triumph
do
the
flowers
of
the
spreading
agnus
castus
mingle
with
the
pomegranate
of
shemlek
does
the
asiatic
andrachne
rear
its
red
trunk
are
the
nerit
and
verdant
alia
marina
imbost
upon
the
rocks
and
do
the
golden
clusters
of
eastern
spartium
gleam
amidst
the
fragrant
foliage
of
the
cedrat
the
most
elegant
shrub
of
the
levant
do
they
mary
believe
not
answered
she
then
our
fields
are
all
over
daisies
butterflowers
and
daffodowndillies
cried
i
mary
mary
you
may
be
a
very
good
girl
but
you
do
not
shine
in
description
now
i
leave
it
to
your
own
taste
which
sounds
better
asiatic
andrachne
or
daffodowndillies
if
you
knew
any
thing
of
novels
you
would
describe
for
the
ear
not
for
the
eye
oh
my
young
friend
never
while
you
live
say
daffodowndillies
if
i
can
help
it
said
mary
i
hope
you
are
not
offended
with
me
or
think
the
worse
of
me
on
account
of
my
having
said
it
now
for
i
could
safely
make
oath
that
i
never
heard
till
this
instant
of
its
being
a
naughty
word
am
satisfied
said
i
now
let
us
tell
our
loves
and
you
shall
begin
said
she
have
nothing
to
tell
cried
i
william
never
save
your
life
then
he
had
a
quarrel
with
you
in
all
his
born
days
why
how
long
have
you
known
him
six
months
he
took
a
small
farm
near
us
and
he
liked
me
from
the
first
and
i
liked
him
and
both
families
wished
for
the
match
and
when
he
asked
me
to
marry
him
i
said
i
would
and
so
we
shall
be
married
next
week
and
that
is
the
whole
history
melancholy
history
indeed
said
i
a
pity
that
an
interesting
pair
like
you
who
without
flattery
seem
born
for
one
of
marmontel
tales
should
be
so
cruelly
sacrificed
i
then
began
to
consider
whether
any
thing
could
yet
be
done
in
their
behalf
or
whether
the
matter
was
indeed
past
redemption
i
reflected
that
it
would
be
but
an
act
of
common
charity
hardly
deserving
praise
to
snatch
them
awhile
from
the
dogged
and
headlong
way
they
were
setting
about
matrimony
and
introduce
them
to
a
few
of
the
sensibilities
surely
with
very
little
ingenuity
i
might
get
up
an
incident
or
two
between
them
a
week
or
a
fortnight
torture
perhaps
and
afterwards
enjoy
the
luxury
of
reuniting
them
full
of
this
laudable
intention
i
sat
meditating
awhile
and
at
length
hit
upon
an
admirable
plan
it
was
no
less
than
to
make
mary
without
her
own
knowledge
write
a
letter
to
william
dismissing
him
for
ever
this
appears
impossible
but
attend
story
said
i
to
the
unsuspecting
girl
long
and
lamentable
and
i
fear
i
have
not
spirits
to
relate
it
i
shall
merely
tell
you
that
i
yesterday
eloped
with
the
younger
of
the
gentlemen
who
were
here
this
morning
and
married
him
i
was
induced
to
take
this
step
in
consequence
of
my
parents
having
insisted
that
i
should
marry
my
first
cousin
who
by
the
by
is
a
namesake
of
your
william
now
mary
i
have
a
favour
to
beg
of
you
my
cousin
william
must
be
made
acquainted
with
my
marriage
though
i
mean
to
keep
it
a
secret
from
my
family
and
as
i
do
not
wish
to
tell
him
such
unhappy
tidings
in
my
own
and
in
high
life
my
fair
rustic
young
ladies
must
not
write
to
young
gentlemen
your
taking
the
trouble
to
write
out
the
letter
for
me
would
bind
me
to
you
for
ever
i
will
and
welcome
said
the
simple
girl
i
fear
i
shall
disgrace
a
lady
like
you
with
my
bad
writing
i
am
out
and
out
the
worst
scribbler
in
our
family
and
william
says
to
me
but
yesterday
ah
mary
says
he
if
your
tongue
talked
as
your
pen
writes
you
might
die
an
old
maid
for
me
ah
william
says
i
i
would
bite
off
my
tongue
sooner
than
die
an
old
maid
so
to
be
sure
willy
laughed
very
hearty
we
then
returned
home
and
retired
to
my
chamber
where
i
dictated
and
mary
wrote
as
follows
william
your
mind
for
receiving
a
great
and
unexpected
shock
to
keep
you
no
longer
in
suspense
learn
that
i
am
married
i
had
become
acquainted
with
you
i
was
attached
to
another
man
whose
name
i
must
beg
leave
to
conceal
about
a
year
since
circumstances
compelled
him
to
go
abroad
and
before
his
departure
he
procured
a
written
promise
from
me
to
marry
him
on
the
first
day
of
his
return
you
then
came
and
succeeded
in
rivalling
him
he
never
once
wrote
after
he
had
left
the
country
i
concluded
that
he
was
dead
yesterday
however
a
letter
from
him
was
put
into
my
hand
which
announced
his
return
and
appointed
a
private
interview
i
went
he
had
a
clergyman
in
waiting
to
join
our
hands
i
prayed
entreated
wept
all
in
vain
became
his
wife
william
pity
but
do
not
blame
me
if
you
are
a
man
of
honour
and
of
feeling
never
shew
this
letter
or
tell
its
contents
to
one
living
soul
do
not
even
speak
to
myself
on
the
subject
of
it
see
i
pay
your
own
feelings
the
compliment
of
not
signing
the
name
that
i
now
bear
dear
william
adieu
for
ever
we
then
returned
to
the
and
found
william
there
while
we
were
conversing
i
took
an
opportunity
to
slip
the
letter
unperceived
into
his
hand
and
to
bid
him
read
it
in
some
other
place
he
retired
with
it
and
we
continued
talking
but
in
about
half
an
hour
he
hurried
into
the
room
with
an
agitated
countenance
stopped
opposite
to
mary
and
looked
at
her
earnestly
cried
she
for
shame
then
do
frighten
one
so
mary
said
he
scorn
to
frighten
you
or
injure
you
either
i
believe
i
am
above
that
but
no
wonder
my
last
look
at
you
should
be
frightful
there
is
your
knot
there
is
your
hair
there
are
your
letters
so
now
mary
and
may
you
be
for
ever
happy
is
what
i
pray
providence
from
the
bottom
of
my
broken
heart
with
these
words
and
a
piteous
glance
of
anguish
he
rushed
from
the
room
mary
remained
motionless
a
moment
then
half
rose
sat
down
rose
again
and
grew
pale
and
red
by
turns
so
so
laughable
said
she
at
length
while
her
quivering
lip
refused
the
attempted
smile
my
presents
returned
too
sure
my
heavens
sure
he
can
not
want
to
break
off
with
me
well
i
have
as
good
a
spirit
as
he
i
believe
the
base
man
the
cruel
cruel
man
and
she
burst
into
a
passion
of
tears
i
tried
to
sooth
her
but
the
more
i
said
the
more
she
wept
she
was
sure
she
said
she
was
quite
sure
that
he
wanted
to
leave
her
and
then
she
sobbed
so
piteously
that
i
was
on
the
point
of
undeceiving
her
when
fortunately
we
heard
her
father
returning
and
she
ran
into
her
own
room
he
asked
about
her
i
told
him
that
she
was
not
well
the
old
excuse
of
a
fretting
heroine
so
the
good
man
went
to
her
and
with
some
difficulty
gained
admittance
they
have
remained
together
ever
since
how
delicious
will
be
the
happy
denouement
of
this
pathetic
episode
this
dear
novellette
and
how
sweetly
will
it
read
in
my
memoirs
adieu
letter
xxiv
the
night
was
so
dark
when
i
repaired
to
the
casement
that
i
have
been
trying
to
compose
a
description
of
it
for
you
in
the
style
of
the
best
romances
but
after
having
summoned
to
my
mind
all
the
black
articles
of
value
that
i
can
recollect
ebony
sables
palls
pitch
and
even
coal
i
find
i
have
nothing
better
to
say
than
simply
that
it
was
a
dark
night
having
opened
the
casement
i
sat
down
at
it
and
repeated
these
lines
aloud
sonnet
now
while
within
their
wings
each
feather
pair
hide
their
hush
heads
thy
visit
moon
renew
shake
thy
pale
tresses
down
irradiate
air
earth
and
the
spicy
flowers
that
scent
the
dew
the
lonely
nightingale
shall
pipe
to
thee
and
i
will
moralize
her
minstrelsy
ten
thousand
birds
the
sun
resplendent
sing
one
only
warbles
to
the
milder
moon
thus
for
the
great
how
many
wake
the
string
thus
for
the
good
how
few
the
lyre
attune
as
soon
as
i
had
finished
the
sonnet
a
low
and
tremulous
voice
close
to
the
casement
sung
these
words
song
haste
my
love
and
come
away
what
is
folly
what
is
sorrow
is
to
turn
from
joys
tis
to
wait
for
cares
the
river
aspens
shiver
thus
i
tremble
at
delay
light
discovers
vowing
lovers
see
the
stars
with
sharpened
ray
gathering
thicker
glancing
quicker
haste
my
love
and
come
away
i
sat
enraptured
and
heaved
a
sigh
sigh
cried
the
singer
as
he
sprang
through
the
window
but
it
was
not
the
voice
of
stuart
i
screamed
loudly
cried
the
mysterious
unknown
and
advanced
towards
me
when
to
my
great
relief
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
the
old
peasant
entered
with
mary
behind
him
holding
a
candle
in
the
middle
of
the
room
stood
a
man
clad
in
a
black
cloak
with
black
feathers
in
his
hat
and
a
black
mask
on
his
face
the
peasant
pale
as
death
ran
forward
knocked
him
to
the
ground
and
seized
a
pistol
and
that
were
stuck
in
a
belt
about
his
waist
him
cried
i
the
peasant
kneeling
on
his
body
tore
off
the
mask
and
i
beheld
betterton
the
neighbours
mary
cried
the
peasant
mary
put
down
the
candle
and
went
out
must
appear
in
an
unfavourable
light
to
you
my
good
man
said
this
terrifying
character
the
young
lady
will
inform
you
that
i
came
hither
at
her
own
request
shame
cried
i
a
falsehood
said
he
have
your
own
letter
desiring
me
to
come
man
is
mad
cried
i
never
wrote
him
a
letter
can
produce
it
to
your
face
said
he
pulling
a
paper
from
his
pocket
and
to
my
great
amazement
reading
these
lines
begs
that
betterton
will
repair
to
her
window
at
ten
disguised
like
an
italian
assassin
with
dagger
cloak
and
pistol
the
signal
is
to
be
his
singing
an
air
under
the
casement
which
she
will
then
open
and
he
may
enter
her
chamber
will
take
the
most
solemn
oath
cried
i
i
never
wrote
a
line
of
it
but
this
unhappy
wretch
who
is
a
ruffian
of
the
first
pretensions
has
a
base
design
upon
me
and
has
followed
me
from
london
for
the
purpose
of
effecting
it
so
i
suppose
he
wrote
the
letter
himself
as
an
excuse
in
case
of
discovery
he
shall
march
to
the
magistrate
said
the
peasant
i
will
indict
him
for
a
man
half
so
frantic
as
betterton
i
never
beheld
he
foamed
he
grinned
he
grinded
the
remnants
of
his
teeth
and
swore
that
stuart
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
whole
plot
by
this
time
mary
having
returned
with
two
men
we
set
forward
in
a
body
to
the
magistrate
and
delivered
our
depositions
before
him
i
swore
that
i
did
not
write
the
letter
and
that
to
the
best
of
my
belief
betterton
harboured
bad
designs
against
me
the
peasant
swore
that
he
had
found
the
culprit
armed
with
a
knife
and
pistol
in
his
house
the
magistrate
therefore
notwithstanding
all
that
betterton
could
say
committed
him
to
prison
without
hesitation
as
they
were
leading
him
away
he
cast
a
furious
look
at
the
magistrate
and
said
sir
i
suppose
you
are
one
of
those
pensioned
justices
who
minister
our
vague
and
sanguinary
laws
and
do
dark
deeds
for
our
usurping
oligarchy
that
has
assumed
a
power
of
making
our
most
innocent
actions
misdemeanours
of
determining
points
of
law
without
appeal
of
imprisoning
our
persons
without
trial
and
of
breaking
open
our
houses
with
the
standing
army
but
nothing
will
go
right
till
we
have
a
reform
in
parliament
neither
peace
nor
war
commerce
nor
agriculture
nor
watches
i
suppose
said
the
magistrate
clocks
nor
watches
cried
betterton
in
a
rage
how
can
our
mechanics
make
any
thing
good
while
a
packed
parliament
deprives
them
of
money
and
a
mart
then
said
the
magistrate
dunstan
clock
is
out
of
order
is
owing
to
the
want
of
a
reform
in
parliament
have
not
the
most
distant
doubt
of
it
cried
betterton
fair
then
said
the
magistrate
the
reformists
should
take
such
a
latitude
as
they
do
for
probably
by
their
encouragement
of
they
will
at
last
discover
the
longitude
sneering
sir
cried
betterton
do
your
duty
as
you
call
it
and
abide
the
consequence
this
gallant
grey
lothario
was
then
led
off
and
our
party
returned
home
adieu
letter
xxv
i
rose
early
this
morning
and
repaired
to
my
favourite
willow
to
contemplate
the
placid
landscape
flinging
myself
on
the
grass
close
to
the
brook
i
began
to
warble
a
rustic
madrigal
i
then
let
down
my
length
of
tresses
and
stooping
over
the
streamlet
laved
them
in
the
little
urn
of
the
dimpling
naiad
this
you
know
was
agreeable
enough
but
the
accident
that
befel
me
was
not
for
leaning
too
much
over
i
lost
my
balance
and
rolled
headlong
into
the
middle
of
the
rivulet
as
it
was
shallow
i
did
not
fear
being
drowned
but
as
i
was
a
heroine
i
hoped
to
be
rescued
therefore
instead
of
rising
as
i
might
easily
have
done
there
i
lay
shrieking
and
listening
and
now
and
then
lifting
up
my
head
in
hopes
to
see
stuart
come
flying
towards
me
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
oh
no
my
gentleman
thought
proper
to
make
himself
scarce
so
dripping
shivering
and
indignant
i
scrambled
out
and
bent
my
steps
towards
the
cottage
on
turning
the
corner
of
the
hedge
who
should
i
perceive
at
the
door
but
the
hopeful
youth
himself
quite
at
his
ease
and
blowing
a
penny
trumpet
for
a
chubby
boy
has
happened
to
you
said
he
seeing
me
so
wet
that
i
fell
into
the
brook
answered
i
was
under
the
disagreeable
necessity
of
saving
my
own
life
when
i
expected
that
you
would
have
condescended
to
take
the
trouble
off
my
hands
cried
he
you
had
no
reason
for
supposing
that
i
was
so
near
to
you
as
even
to
have
witnessed
the
disaster
it
is
therefore
retorted
i
you
ought
to
have
been
so
near
me
as
to
have
witnessed
it
deal
in
riddles
said
he
at
all
answered
i
the
farther
off
a
distrest
heroine
believes
a
hero
the
nearer
he
is
sure
to
be
only
let
her
have
good
grounds
for
supposing
him
at
her
antipodes
and
nine
times
out
of
ten
she
finds
him
at
her
elbow
said
he
laughing
i
did
not
save
your
life
i
will
not
endanger
it
by
detaining
you
in
your
wet
dress
pray
hasten
to
change
it
i
took
his
advice
and
borrowed
some
clothes
from
mary
while
mine
were
put
to
the
fire
after
breakfast
i
once
more
equipped
myself
in
my
tuscan
costume
and
a
carriage
being
ready
for
us
i
took
an
affectionate
leave
of
that
interesting
rustic
poor
girl
her
attempts
at
cheerfulness
all
the
morning
were
truly
tragical
and
absorbed
in
another
sorrow
she
felt
but
little
for
my
departure
on
our
way
stuart
confessed
that
he
was
the
person
who
wrote
the
letter
to
betterton
in
my
name
and
that
he
did
so
for
the
purpose
of
entrapping
him
in
such
a
manner
as
to
prevent
him
from
accompanying
me
farther
he
was
at
the
window
during
the
whole
scene
as
he
meant
to
have
seized
betterton
himself
had
not
the
peasant
done
so
will
excuse
my
thus
interfering
in
your
concerns
added
he
gratitude
demands
of
me
to
protect
the
daughter
of
my
guardian
and
friendship
for
her
improves
the
duty
to
a
pleasure
said
i
it
has
happened
i
fear
you
dislike
me
strangely
me
you
mistake
answered
he
a
few
foibles
which
are
themselves
as
fascinating
as
foibles
can
be
you
possess
many
virtues
and
let
me
add
a
thousand
attractions
i
who
tell
you
blunt
truths
may
well
afford
you
flattery
said
i
pleased
by
his
praises
and
willing
to
please
him
in
return
by
serious
conversation
censure
only
when
the
motive
for
using
it
is
mean
or
vicious
remark
is
a
just
one
observed
he
is
often
but
the
hyperbole
of
friendship
and
even
though
a
compliment
itself
may
not
be
sincere
our
motive
for
paying
it
may
be
good
flattery
so
far
from
injuring
may
sometimes
benefit
the
object
of
it
for
it
is
possible
to
create
a
virtue
in
others
by
persuading
them
that
they
possess
it
said
i
we
not
pay
a
compliment
without
intending
that
it
should
be
believed
but
merely
to
make
ourselves
agreeable
by
an
effort
of
the
wit
and
since
such
an
effort
shews
that
we
consider
the
person
flattered
worthy
of
it
the
compliment
proves
a
kind
intention
at
least
and
thus
tends
to
cement
affection
and
friendship
in
this
manner
stuart
insensibly
led
me
to
talk
on
grave
topics
and
we
continued
a
delightful
conversation
the
remainder
of
the
day
sometimes
he
seemed
greatly
gratified
at
my
sprightly
sallies
or
serious
remarks
but
never
could
i
throw
him
off
his
guard
by
the
dangerous
softness
of
my
manner
he
now
calls
me
the
lovely
visionary
would
you
believe
that
this
laughing
careless
unpathetic
creature
is
a
poet
and
a
poet
of
feeling
as
the
following
lines
will
prove
but
whether
he
wrote
them
on
a
real
or
an
imaginary
being
i
can
not
by
any
art
extract
from
him
the
farewell
go
gentle
muse
is
near
the
gloomy
day
long
dreaded
go
and
say
farewell
for
me
a
sad
farewell
to
her
who
deigned
thee
say
for
far
she
hastens
hence
ah
hard
decree
tell
her
i
feel
that
at
the
parting
hour
more
than
the
waves
will
heave
in
tumult
wild
more
than
the
skies
will
threat
a
gushing
shower
more
than
the
breeze
will
breathe
a
murmur
mild
say
that
her
influence
flies
not
with
her
form
that
distant
she
will
still
engage
my
mind
that
suns
are
most
remote
when
most
they
warm
that
flying
parthians
scatter
darts
behind
long
will
i
gaze
upon
her
vacant
home
as
the
bird
lingers
near
its
pilfered
nest
there
will
i
cry
she
turned
the
studious
tome
there
sported
there
her
envied
pet
caressed
there
while
she
plied
accomplished
works
of
art
i
saw
her
form
inclined
with
sapphic
grace
her
radiant
eyes
blest
emblems
of
her
heart
and
all
the
living
treasures
of
her
face
the
parian
forehead
parting
clustered
hair
the
cheek
of
peachy
tinct
the
meaning
brow
the
witching
archness
and
the
grace
so
rare
so
magical
it
charmed
i
knew
not
how
light
was
her
footstep
as
the
silent
flakes
of
falling
snow
her
smile
was
blithe
as
morn
her
dimple
like
the
print
the
berry
makes
in
some
smooth
lake
when
dropping
from
the
thorn
to
snatch
her
passing
accents
as
she
spoke
to
see
her
slender
hand
that
future
prize
fling
back
a
ringlet
oft
i
dared
provoke
the
gentle
vengeance
of
averted
eyes
yet
ah
what
wonder
if
when
shrinking
awe
withheld
me
from
her
sight
i
broke
my
chain
or
when
i
made
a
single
glance
my
law
what
wonder
if
that
law
were
made
in
vain
and
say
can
nought
but
converse
love
inspire
what
tho
for
me
her
lips
have
never
moved
the
vale
that
speaks
but
with
its
feathered
choir
when
long
beheld
eternally
is
loved
go
then
my
muse
is
near
the
gloomy
day
of
parting
go
and
say
farewell
for
me
a
sad
farewell
to
her
who
deigned
thee
say
engage
her
she
be
if
slumbering
tell
her
in
my
dreams
she
sways
if
speaking
tell
her
in
my
words
she
glows
if
thoughtful
tell
her
in
my
thoughts
she
strays
if
tuneful
tell
her
in
my
song
she
flows
tell
her
that
soon
my
dreams
unblest
will
prove
that
soon
my
words
on
absent
charms
will
dwell
that
soon
my
thoughts
remembered
hours
will
love
that
soon
my
song
of
vain
regrets
will
tell
then
in
romantic
moments
i
will
frame
some
scene
ideal
where
we
meet
at
last
where
by
my
peril
snatched
from
wreck
or
flame
she
smiles
reward
and
talks
of
all
the
past
now
for
the
lark
she
flies
my
wistful
lay
ah
could
the
bard
some
winged
warbler
be
following
her
form
no
longer
would
he
say
go
gentle
muse
and
bid
farewell
for
me
i
write
from
an
inn
within
a
mile
of
lady
gwyn
another
hour
and
my
fate
is
decided
adieu
letter
xxvi
at
length
with
a
throbbing
heart
i
now
for
the
first
time
beheld
the
mansion
of
my
revered
ancestors
the
present
abode
of
lady
gwyn
that
unfortunate
usurper
of
my
rights
was
not
denied
to
me
so
i
alighted
and
though
stuart
wished
much
to
be
present
at
the
interview
i
would
not
permit
him
but
was
ushered
by
the
footman
into
the
i
entered
with
erect
yet
gentle
majesty
while
my
tuscan
habit
which
was
soiled
and
shrivelled
by
the
brook
gave
me
an
air
of
complicated
distress
i
found
her
ladyship
at
a
table
classifying
fossils
she
was
tall
and
thin
and
bore
the
remains
of
beauty
but
i
could
not
discover
the
family
face
she
looked
at
me
with
some
surprise
smiled
and
begged
to
know
my
business
is
a
business
said
i
the
most
vital
importance
to
your
ladyship
honour
and
repose
and
i
lament
that
an
imperious
necessity
compels
me
to
the
invidious
task
of
acquainting
you
with
it
could
anything
add
to
the
painful
nature
of
my
feelings
it
would
be
to
find
that
i
had
wounded
yours
preamble
alarms
me
said
she
pray
be
explicit
must
begin
said
i
declaring
my
perfect
conviction
of
your
ignorance
that
any
person
is
existing
who
has
a
right
to
the
property
which
your
ladyship
at
present
possesses
such
a
notion
never
entered
my
head
said
she
indeed
were
such
a
claim
made
i
should
consider
it
as
utterly
untenable
in
fact
impossible
regret
said
i
it
is
undeniable
there
are
documents
extant
and
witnesses
living
to
prove
it
beyond
all
refutation
her
ladyship
i
thought
changed
colour
as
she
said
is
strange
but
i
can
not
believe
it
who
would
have
the
face
to
set
up
such
a
silly
claim
am
so
unfortunate
as
to
have
that
face
answered
i
in
a
tone
of
the
most
touching
humility
she
cried
with
amazement
me
the
pain
i
give
you
said
i
such
is
the
fact
and
grating
as
this
interview
must
be
to
the
feelings
of
both
parties
i
do
assure
you
that
i
have
sought
it
solely
to
prevent
the
more
disagreeable
process
of
a
are
welcome
to
twenty
if
you
wish
them
cried
she
i
fancy
they
will
not
deprive
me
of
my
property
least
said
i
may
be
the
means
of
sullying
the
character
of
your
deceased
lord
defy
the
whole
world
cried
she
affix
the
slightest
imputation
on
his
character
said
i
can
not
pretend
ignorance
of
the
fact
that
his
lordship
had
the
character
of
being
i
trust
more
from
misfortune
than
from
inherent
depravity
for
your
ladyship
well
knows
that
man
frail
man
in
a
moment
of
temptation
perpetrates
atrocities
which
his
better
heart
afterwards
disowns
his
character
cried
she
of
his
character
said
i
ladyship
will
not
compel
me
to
mention
have
advanced
too
far
to
retreat
cried
she
demand
an
unequivocal
explanation
what
of
his
character
since
i
must
speak
plain
replied
i
was
that
of
an
assassin
powers
said
she
in
a
faint
voice
and
reddening
violently
does
the
horrid
woman
mean
have
at
this
moment
cried
i
person
ready
to
make
oath
that
your
unhappy
husband
bribed
a
servant
of
my
father
to
murder
me
while
yet
an
infant
in
cold
blood
a
falsehood
cried
she
would
stake
my
life
on
its
being
a
vile
malicious
diabolical
falsehood
it
were
said
i
oh
lady
gwyn
the
circumstances
the
dreadful
circumstances
these
can
not
be
contradicted
it
was
midnight
the
bones
of
my
noble
father
had
just
been
deposited
in
the
grave
when
a
tall
figure
wrapt
in
a
dark
cloak
and
armed
with
a
dagger
stood
before
the
seneschal
was
the
late
lord
gwyn
are
you
cried
she
starting
up
quite
pale
and
the
name
of
all
that
is
dreadful
who
can
you
be
own
niece
said
i
meekly
kneeling
to
receive
her
blessing
cherubina
de
willoughby
the
daughter
of
your
ladyship
deceased
brother
lord
de
willoughby
and
of
his
much
injured
wife
the
lady
hysterica
belamour
heard
of
such
persons
in
all
my
life
cried
she
ringing
the
bell
furiously
said
i
calm
act
with
dignity
in
this
affair
do
not
disgrace
our
family
on
my
honour
i
mean
to
treat
you
with
kindness
nay
we
must
positively
be
on
terms
of
friendship
i
make
it
a
point
after
all
what
is
rank
what
are
riches
how
vapid
their
charms
compared
with
the
heartfelt
joys
of
truth
and
virtue
o
lady
gwyn
o
my
respected
aunt
i
conjure
you
by
our
common
ties
of
blood
by
your
brother
who
was
my
father
spurn
the
perilous
toy
fortune
and
retire
in
time
and
without
exposing
your
lost
lord
into
the
peaceful
bosom
of
obscurity
this
wretch
out
of
the
house
said
her
ladyship
to
the
servant
who
had
entered
wants
to
extort
money
from
me
i
believe
moment
more
cried
i
is
old
eftsoones
where
is
that
worthy
character
know
no
such
person
said
she
impostor
at
the
word
impostor
i
smiled
drew
aside
my
ringlets
with
one
hand
and
pointed
to
my
inestimable
mole
with
the
other
i
an
impostor
now
cried
i
learn
unfortunate
woman
that
i
have
a
certain
parchment
too
a
great
deal
of
insolence
too
said
she
resemblance
of
it
at
least
cried
i
i
have
your
portrait
portrait
said
she
with
a
sneer
sure
as
your
name
is
nell
gwyn
cried
i
nell
gwyn
is
written
under
it
and
let
me
add
that
you
would
have
consulted
both
your
own
taste
and
the
dignity
of
our
house
better
had
you
got
it
written
eleanor
instead
of
nell
little
impertinent
reprobate
exclaimed
she
feeling
the
peculiar
poignancy
of
the
sarcasm
this
moment
or
i
will
have
you
drummed
through
the
village
i
waved
my
hand
in
token
of
high
disdain
and
vanished
said
stuart
as
i
got
to
the
carriage
her
ladyship
acknowledged
your
claims
truly
cried
i
she
has
turned
me
out
of
my
own
house
think
of
that
said
he
springing
from
the
chaise
will
try
whether
i
can
not
succeed
better
with
her
ladyship
and
he
went
into
the
house
i
remained
in
a
state
of
the
greatest
perturbation
till
he
came
back
news
cried
he
ladyship
wishes
to
see
you
and
apologize
for
her
rudeness
and
i
fancy
added
he
with
a
significant
nod
will
go
well
in
a
certain
affair
yes
said
i
nodding
in
return
flatter
myself
she
now
finds
civility
the
best
of
her
game
i
then
alighted
and
her
ladyship
ran
forward
to
meet
me
she
pressed
my
hand
me
twice
in
a
breath
told
me
that
stuart
had
given
her
my
little
history
that
it
was
delicious
elegant
exotic
and
concluded
with
declaring
that
i
must
remain
at
her
house
a
few
days
to
talk
over
the
great
object
of
my
visit
much
as
i
mistrusted
this
sudden
alteration
in
her
conduct
i
consented
to
spend
a
short
time
with
her
on
the
principle
that
heroines
always
contrive
to
get
under
the
same
roof
with
their
bitterest
enemies
stuart
appeared
quite
delighted
at
my
determination
and
after
another
private
interview
with
her
ladyship
set
off
for
london
to
make
further
inquiries
about
wilkinson
i
am
however
resolved
not
to
release
that
mischievous
farmer
till
i
have
secured
my
title
and
estate
you
see
i
am
grown
quite
sharp
her
ladyship
and
i
had
then
a
long
conversation
and
she
fairly
confessed
the
probability
that
my
claims
are
just
but
denied
all
knowledge
of
old
eftsoones
i
now
begin
to
think
rather
better
of
her
she
has
the
sweetest
temper
in
the
world
loves
literature
and
perroquets
scrapes
mezzotintos
and
spends
half
her
income
in
buying
any
thing
that
is
hardly
to
be
had
she
led
me
through
her
cabinet
which
contains
the
most
curious
assortment
in
nature
vases
of
onyx
and
sardonyx
cameos
and
intaglios
subjects
in
teeth
by
fiamingo
and
benvenuto
cellini
and
antique
gems
in
jadestone
mochoa
coral
amber
and
turkish
agate
she
has
already
presented
me
with
several
dresses
and
she
calls
me
her
lovely
and
the
lady
cherubina
a
sound
that
makes
my
very
heart
leap
within
me
nay
she
did
me
the
honour
of
assuring
me
that
her
curiosity
to
know
a
real
heroine
was
one
motive
for
her
having
asked
me
on
this
visit
and
that
she
positively
considers
an
hour
with
me
worth
all
her
curiosities
put
together
what
a
delicate
compliment
so
could
i
do
less
in
return
than
repeat
my
assurances
that
when
i
succeed
in
dispossessing
her
of
the
property
she
shall
never
want
an
asylum
in
my
house
adieu
letter
xxvii
think
of
its
having
never
once
struck
me
till
i
had
retired
for
the
night
that
i
might
be
murdered
how
so
manifest
a
danger
escaped
my
recollection
is
inconceivable
but
so
it
was
i
never
thought
of
it
lady
gwyn
might
be
for
any
thing
i
could
tell
to
the
contrary
just
as
capable
of
plotting
an
assassination
as
the
marchesa
di
vivaldi
and
surely
her
motives
were
far
more
urgent
i
therefore
searched
in
my
chamber
for
some
or
sliding
pannel
by
which
assassins
might
enter
it
but
i
could
find
none
i
then
resolved
on
exploring
the
galleries
corridors
and
suites
of
apartments
in
this
immense
mansion
in
hopes
to
discover
some
place
of
retreat
or
at
least
some
mystery
relative
to
my
birth
accordingly
at
the
celebrated
hour
of
midnight
i
took
up
the
taper
and
unbolting
my
door
stole
softly
along
the
lobby
i
stopped
before
one
of
our
family
pictures
it
was
of
a
lady
pale
pensive
and
interesting
and
whose
eyes
which
appeared
to
look
at
me
were
like
my
own
that
was
sufficient
image
of
my
departed
mother
ejaculated
i
kneeling
before
it
thy
sacred
ashes
repose
in
peace
i
then
faintly
chaunted
a
fragment
of
a
hymn
and
advanced
no
sigh
met
my
listening
ear
no
moan
amidst
the
pauses
of
the
gust
with
a
trembling
hand
i
opened
a
door
and
found
myself
in
a
spacious
chamber
it
was
magnificently
furnished
and
a
piano
stood
in
one
corner
of
it
intending
to
run
my
fingers
over
the
keys
i
walked
forward
till
a
low
rustling
in
that
direction
made
me
pause
but
how
shall
i
paint
to
you
my
horror
my
dismay
when
i
heard
the
mysterious
instrument
on
a
sudden
begin
to
sound
not
loudly
but
more
terrible
still
with
a
hurried
murmur
as
if
all
its
chords
were
agitated
at
once
by
the
hand
of
some
invisible
demon
i
did
not
faint
i
did
not
shriek
but
i
stood
transfixed
to
the
spot
the
music
ceased
i
recovered
courage
and
advanced
the
music
began
again
and
again
i
paused
what
should
i
not
lift
the
simple
lid
of
a
mere
piano
after
having
drawn
aside
the
mysterious
veil
and
discovered
the
terrific
wax
doll
underneath
it
emulation
enthusiasm
curiosity
prompted
me
and
i
rushed
undaunted
to
the
piano
louder
and
more
rapid
grew
the
notes
my
desperate
hand
raised
the
cover
and
beneath
it
i
beheld
a
sight
to
me
the
most
hideous
and
fearful
upon
earth
a
mouse
i
screamed
and
dropped
the
candle
which
was
instantly
extinguished
the
mouse
ran
by
me
i
flew
towards
the
door
but
missed
it
and
fell
against
a
table
nor
was
it
till
after
i
had
made
much
clamour
that
i
got
out
of
the
room
as
i
groped
my
way
through
the
corridor
i
heard
voices
and
people
in
confusion
above
stairs
and
presently
lights
appeared
the
whole
house
was
in
a
tumult
are
coming
to
murder
me
at
last
cried
i
as
i
regained
my
chamber
and
began
heaping
chairs
and
tables
against
the
door
presently
several
persons
arrived
at
it
and
called
my
name
i
said
not
a
word
they
called
louder
but
still
i
was
silent
till
at
length
they
burst
open
the
door
and
lady
gwyn
with
some
of
her
domestics
entered
they
found
me
kneeling
in
an
attitude
of
supplication
oh
spare
me
cried
i
dear
said
her
ladyship
harm
shall
happen
you
then
exclaimed
i
portends
this
nocturnal
visit
this
assault
on
my
chamber
all
these
dreadful
faces
was
it
not
enough
unhappy
woman
that
thy
husband
attempted
my
life
but
must
thou
too
thirst
for
my
blood
lady
gwyn
whispered
a
servant
who
left
the
room
the
rest
raised
and
put
me
to
bed
while
i
read
her
ladyship
such
a
lecture
on
murder
as
absolutely
astonished
her
the
servant
soon
after
returned
with
a
cup
my
love
said
her
ladyship
a
composing
draught
for
you
drink
it
and
you
will
be
quite
well
i
took
it
with
gladness
for
i
felt
my
brain
strangely
bewildered
by
the
terror
that
i
had
just
undergone
indeed
i
have
sometimes
experienced
the
same
sensation
before
and
it
is
extremely
disagreeable
they
then
left
a
candle
in
my
room
and
departed
my
mind
still
remains
uneasy
but
i
have
barricaded
the
door
and
am
determined
on
not
undressing
i
believe
however
i
must
now
throw
myself
on
the
bed
for
the
draught
has
made
me
sleepy
adieu
letter
xxviii
o
biddy
grimes
i
am
poisoned
that
fatal
draught
last
night
why
did
i
drink
it
i
am
in
dreadful
agony
when
this
reaches
you
all
will
be
but
i
would
not
die
without
letting
you
know
farewell
for
ever
my
poor
biddy
i
bequeath
you
all
my
ornaments
letter
xxix
yes
my
friend
you
may
well
stare
at
receiving
another
letter
from
me
and
at
hearing
that
i
have
not
been
poisoned
in
the
least
i
must
unfold
the
mystery
when
i
woke
this
morning
after
my
nocturnal
perambulation
i
found
my
limbs
so
stiff
and
such
pains
in
all
my
bones
that
i
was
almost
unable
to
move
judge
of
my
horror
and
despair
for
it
instantly
flashed
across
my
mind
that
lady
gwyn
had
poisoned
me
my
whole
frame
underwent
a
sudden
revulsion
i
grew
sick
and
rang
the
bell
with
violence
nor
ceased
an
instant
till
half
the
servants
and
lady
gwyn
herself
had
burst
into
my
chamber
you
have
a
remnant
of
mercy
left
cried
i
for
a
doctor
is
the
matter
my
dear
said
her
ladyship
that
you
have
poisoned
me
my
dear
cried
i
indeed
i
presume
your
ladyship
imagines
that
the
liberty
you
have
taken
with
my
life
authorizes
all
other
freedoms
oh
what
will
become
of
me
tell
me
said
she
are
you
unwell
am
sick
to
death
cried
i
have
pains
in
all
my
limbs
and
i
shall
be
a
corpse
in
half
an
hour
oh
indeed
you
have
done
the
business
completely
lady
eleanor
gwyn
i
do
here
on
my
and
with
all
my
senses
about
me
accuse
you
before
your
domestics
of
having
administered
a
deadly
potion
to
me
last
night
for
the
physician
said
her
ladyship
to
a
servant
may
you
feel
alarmed
cried
i
life
will
pay
the
forfeit
of
mine
you
need
not
feel
alarmed
said
her
ladyship
really
what
i
gave
you
last
night
was
merely
to
make
you
sleep
cried
i
sleep
of
the
grave
o
lady
gwyn
what
have
i
done
to
you
to
deserve
death
at
your
hands
and
in
such
a
manner
too
had
you
even
shewn
so
much
regard
to
custom
and
common
decency
as
to
have
offered
me
the
potion
in
a
bowl
or
a
goblet
there
might
have
been
some
little
palliation
but
to
add
insult
to
injury
to
trick
me
out
of
my
life
with
a
paltry
to
poison
a
girl
of
my
pretensions
as
vulgarly
as
you
would
a
rat
no
no
madam
this
is
not
to
be
pardoned
her
ladyship
again
began
assuring
me
that
i
had
taken
nothing
more
than
a
soporific
but
i
would
not
hear
her
and
at
length
i
sent
her
and
the
domestics
out
of
the
chamber
that
i
might
prepare
for
my
approaching
end
how
to
prepare
was
the
question
for
i
had
never
thought
of
death
seriously
heroines
so
seldom
die
should
i
follow
the
beautiful
precedent
of
the
dying
heloise
who
called
her
friends
about
her
got
her
chamber
sprinkled
with
flowers
and
perfumes
and
then
gave
up
the
ghost
in
a
state
of
elegant
inebriation
with
wine
which
she
passed
for
spanish
alas
i
had
no
friends
not
even
stuart
at
hand
flowers
and
perfumes
i
would
not
condescend
to
beg
from
my
murderess
and
as
for
wine
i
could
not
abide
the
thoughts
of
it
in
a
morning
but
amidst
these
reflections
a
more
serious
and
less
agreeable
subject
intruded
itself
upon
me
the
thoughts
of
a
future
state
i
strove
to
banish
it
but
it
would
not
be
repulsed
yet
surely
said
i
as
a
heroine
i
am
a
pattern
of
perfect
virtue
and
therefore
i
must
be
happy
hereafter
but
was
virtue
sufficient
at
church
seldom
as
i
had
frequented
it
in
consequence
of
its
sober
ceremonies
so
unsuited
to
my
taste
i
remembered
to
have
heard
a
very
different
doctrine
there
i
had
heard
that
we
can
not
learn
to
do
right
without
the
divine
aid
and
that
to
propitiate
it
we
must
make
ourselves
acquainted
with
those
principles
of
religion
which
enable
us
to
prefer
duteous
prayers
and
to
place
implicit
reliance
on
the
power
and
goodness
of
the
deity
alas
i
knew
nothing
of
religion
except
from
novels
and
in
these
though
the
devotion
of
heroines
is
sentimental
and
graceful
to
a
degree
it
never
influences
their
acts
or
appears
connected
with
their
moral
duties
it
is
so
speculative
and
generalized
that
it
would
answer
the
greek
or
the
persian
church
as
well
as
the
christian
and
none
but
the
picturesque
and
enthusiastic
part
is
presented
such
as
kissing
a
cross
chanting
a
vesper
with
elevated
eyes
or
composing
a
prayer
the
more
i
thought
the
more
horrible
appeared
my
situation
i
felt
a
confused
idea
that
i
had
led
a
worthless
if
not
a
criminal
life
that
i
had
left
myself
without
a
friend
in
this
world
and
had
not
sought
to
make
one
in
the
next
i
became
more
and
more
agitated
i
tried
to
turn
my
thoughts
back
to
the
plan
of
expiring
with
grace
but
all
in
vain
i
then
wrote
the
note
to
you
then
endeavoured
to
pray
nothing
could
calm
or
divert
my
mind
the
pains
grew
worse
i
felt
sick
at
heart
my
palate
was
parched
and
i
now
expected
that
every
breath
would
be
my
last
my
soul
recoiled
from
the
thought
and
my
brain
became
a
confused
chaos
hideous
visions
of
eternity
rushed
into
my
mind
i
lay
shivering
groaning
and
abandoned
to
the
most
deplorable
despair
in
this
state
the
physician
found
me
o
what
a
joyful
relief
when
he
declared
that
my
disorder
was
nothing
but
a
violent
rheumatism
contracted
it
seems
by
my
fall
into
the
water
the
morning
before
never
was
transport
equal
to
mine
and
i
assured
him
that
he
should
have
a
place
in
my
memoirs
he
prescribed
for
me
but
remarked
that
i
might
remain
ill
a
whole
month
or
be
quite
well
in
a
few
days
said
her
ladyship
must
be
quite
well
in
four
for
then
my
ball
comes
on
and
i
mean
to
make
you
the
most
conspicuous
figure
at
it
i
have
great
plans
for
you
i
assure
you
i
thanked
her
ladyship
and
begged
pardon
for
having
been
so
giddy
as
to
call
her
a
murderess
while
she
laughed
at
my
mistake
and
made
quite
light
of
it
noble
woman
but
i
dare
say
magnanimity
is
our
family
virtue
no
sooner
had
i
ceased
to
be
miserable
about
leaving
the
world
than
i
became
almost
as
much
so
about
losing
the
ball
to
lose
it
from
any
cause
whatever
was
sufficiently
provoking
but
to
lose
it
by
so
gross
a
disorder
as
a
rheumatism
was
indeed
dreadful
now
had
i
even
some
pale
genteel
illness
curable
by
hartshorn
i
would
bless
my
kind
stars
and
drink
that
nauseous
cordial
from
morning
even
unto
night
for
disguise
thyself
as
thou
wilt
hartshorn
still
thou
art
a
bitter
draught
and
though
heroines
in
all
novels
have
been
made
to
drink
of
thee
thou
art
no
less
bitter
on
that
account
being
on
this
subject
i
have
to
lament
that
i
am
utterly
unacquainted
with
those
refined
ailments
which
every
girl
that
i
read
of
meets
with
as
things
of
course
the
consequence
is
my
wanting
that
beauty
which
touched
with
the
languid
delicacy
of
illness
gains
from
sentiment
what
it
loses
in
bloom
so
that
really
this
constitution
of
mine
is
a
terrible
disadvantage
to
me
i
know
had
i
the
power
of
inventing
my
own
indispositions
i
would
strike
out
something
far
beyond
even
the
hectics
and
of
my
fair
predecessors
i
believe
there
is
not
a
but
i
would
fall
ill
of
a
scald
from
a
lover
tear
or
a
classic
scratch
from
the
thorn
of
a
rose
adieu
letter
xxx
this
morning
i
awoke
almost
free
from
pain
and
towards
evening
i
was
able
to
appear
in
the
lady
gwyn
had
asked
several
of
her
friends
to
tea
so
that
i
passed
a
delightful
afternoon
the
charm
admiration
and
astonishment
of
all
on
retiring
for
the
night
to
my
chamber
i
found
this
note
on
my
toilette
and
read
it
with
a
beating
heart
the
lady
mother
lives
and
is
confined
in
one
of
the
subterranean
vaults
belonging
to
the
villa
at
midnight
you
will
hear
a
tapping
at
your
door
open
it
and
two
men
in
masks
will
appear
outside
they
will
blindfold
and
conduct
you
to
her
you
will
know
her
by
her
striking
likeness
to
her
picture
in
the
gallery
be
silent
courageous
and
circumspect
unknown
friend
what
a
flood
of
new
feelings
gushed
upon
my
soul
as
i
laid
down
the
billet
and
lifted
my
filial
eyes
to
heaven
i
was
about
to
behold
my
mother
mother
endearing
name
i
pictured
to
myself
that
unfortunate
lady
stretched
on
a
mattrass
of
straw
her
eyes
sunken
in
their
sockets
yet
still
retaining
a
portion
of
their
wonted
fire
her
frame
emaciated
her
voice
feeble
her
hand
damp
and
chill
fondly
did
i
depict
our
meeting
our
embrace
she
gently
pushing
me
from
her
to
gaze
on
all
the
lineaments
of
my
countenance
and
then
baring
my
temple
to
search
for
the
mole
all
all
is
convincing
and
she
calls
me
the
softened
image
of
my
noble
father
two
tedious
hours
i
waited
in
extreme
anxiety
till
at
length
the
clock
struck
twelve
my
heart
beat
responsive
and
in
a
few
moments
after
i
heard
the
promised
signal
at
my
door
i
unbolted
it
and
beheld
two
men
in
masks
and
cloaks
they
blindfolded
me
and
each
taking
an
arm
led
me
along
not
a
word
passed
we
traversed
several
suites
of
apartments
ascended
flights
of
stairs
descended
others
now
went
this
way
now
that
obliquely
circularly
angularly
till
i
began
actually
to
imagine
we
were
all
the
time
in
one
spot
at
length
my
conductors
stopped
the
postern
gate
whispered
one
i
light
a
torch
are
betrayed
said
the
other
this
is
the
wrong
key
thou
beest
the
traitor
cried
the
first
liest
dost
lie
and
art
lying
cried
the
second
that
exclaimed
the
first
a
groan
followed
and
the
wretch
dropped
to
the
ground
have
murdered
him
cried
i
sickening
with
horror
have
only
hamstrung
him
my
lady
said
the
fellow
will
be
lame
for
life
shouted
the
wounded
man
his
companion
burst
open
the
gate
a
sudden
current
of
wind
met
us
and
we
fled
along
with
incredible
speed
while
low
moans
and
smothered
shrieks
were
heard
at
either
side
of
us
heaven
where
are
we
cried
i
the
cavern
of
death
said
my
conductor
for
rats
and
banditti
on
a
sudden
innumerable
footsteps
echoed
behind
us
we
ran
swifter
cried
a
ferocious
accent
almost
at
my
ear
and
in
a
moment
several
pistols
were
discharged
i
stopped
unable
to
move
breathe
or
speak
am
wounded
all
over
right
and
left
fore
and
aft
cried
my
conductor
i
bleeding
said
i
feeling
myself
with
my
hands
blessed
anthony
be
praised
answered
he
now
all
is
safe
for
we
are
at
the
cell
and
the
banditti
have
turned
into
the
wrong
passage
he
stopped
and
unlocked
a
door
said
he
behold
your
unhappy
mother
he
led
me
forward
took
the
bandage
from
my
eyes
and
retiring
locked
the
door
upon
me
agitated
already
by
the
terrors
of
my
dangerous
expedition
i
felt
additional
horror
on
finding
myself
in
a
dismal
cell
lighted
with
a
lantern
where
at
a
small
table
sat
a
woman
suffering
under
a
corpulency
unparalleled
in
the
memoirs
of
human
monsters
she
was
clad
in
sackcloth
her
head
was
swathed
in
linen
and
had
grey
locks
on
it
like
horses
tails
hundreds
of
frogs
were
leaping
about
the
floor
a
piece
of
mouldy
bread
a
mug
of
water
and
a
manuscript
lay
on
the
table
some
straw
strewn
with
dead
snakes
and
skulls
occupied
one
corner
and
the
farther
side
of
the
cell
was
concealed
behind
a
black
curtain
i
stood
at
the
door
doubtful
and
afraid
to
advance
while
the
prodigious
prisoner
sat
examining
me
from
head
to
foot
at
last
i
summoned
courage
to
say
fear
madam
i
am
an
intruder
here
i
have
certainly
been
shewn
into
the
wrong
room
is
it
is
my
own
my
only
daughter
my
cherubina
cried
she
with
a
tremendous
voice
to
my
maternal
arms
thou
living
picture
of
the
departed
theodore
said
i
would
with
great
pleasure
but
i
am
afraid
that
oh
madam
indeed
indeed
i
am
quite
sure
you
can
not
be
my
mother
shame
cried
she
not
madam
answered
i
mother
was
of
a
thin
habit
as
her
picture
proves
so
was
i
once
said
she
deplorable
plumpness
is
owing
to
want
of
exercise
you
see
however
that
i
retain
all
my
former
paleness
me
said
i
i
must
say

upon
it
i
will
only
let
me
get
over
the
first
shock
vociferated
she
dreading
her
violence
and
feeling
myself
bound
to
do
the
duties
of
a
daughter
i
kneeled
at
her
feet
and
said
excellent
ever
exalted
author
of
my
being
i
beg
thy
maternal
blessing
my
mother
raised
me
from

and
hugged
me
to
her
heart
with
such
cruel
vigour
that
almost
crushed

this
manuscript
is
a
faithful
narrative
of
my
life
previous
to
my
marriage
it
was
written
by
my
female
confidant
to
divert
her
grief
during
the
long
and
alarming
illness
of
her
dutch
pug
take
it
to
your
chamber
and
blot
it
with
your
tears
my
love
i
put
the
scroll
in
my
bosom
i
shock
your
gentle
feelings
continued
she
relating
my
subsequent
story
suffice
it
that
as
soon
as
you
were
stolen
i
went
mad
about
the
woods
till
i
was
caught
and
on
recovering
my
senses
i
found
myself
in
this
infernal
dungeon
look
at
that
calendar
of
small
sticks
notched
all
over
with
my
dismal
days
and
nights
ten
long
years
i
have
eaten
nothing
but
bread
oh
ye
favourite
pullets
oh
ye
inimitable
shall
i
never
never
taste
you
more
oft
too
my
reason
wanders
oft
i
see
figures
that
rise
like
furies
to
torment
me
i
see
them
when
asleep
i
see
them
now
now
she
sat
in
a
fixed
attitude
of
horror
while
her
straining
eyes
moved
slowly
round
as
if
they
followed
something
i
stood
shuddering
and
hating
her
more
and
more
every
moment
companion
of
my
confinement
cried
she
apostrophizing
a
huge
toad
that
she
pulled
out
of
her
bosom
spotted
fondling
thou
next
to
my
cherubina
art
worthy
of
my
love
embrace
each
other
my
friends
and
she
put
the
hideous
pet
into
my
hand
i
screamed
and
dropped
it
cried
i
in
a
passion
of
despair
madness
possessed
me
to
undertake
this
execrable
enterprize
and
i
began
beating
with
my
hand
against
the
door
you
want
to
leave
your
poor
mother
said
she
in
a
whimpering
tone
i
am
so
frightened
said
i
will
spend
the
night
here
however
cried
she
probably
your
whole
life
too
for
no
doubt
the
ruffian
who
brought
you
hither
was
employed
by
lady
gwyn
to
entrap
you
when
i
heard
this
terrible
suggestion
my
blood
ran
cold
and
i
began
crying
bitterly
my
love
said
my
mother
let
me
lull
thee
to
repose
on
my
soft
bosom
what
is
the
world
to
us
here
in
each
other
society
we
will
enjoy
all
that
affection
all
that
virtue
can
confer
come
my
daughter
and
let
me
clasp
thee
to
my
heart
once
more
cried
i
me
exclaimed
she
you
spurn
my
proffered
embrace
no
madam
answered
i
but
you
squeeze
one
so
my
mother
made
a
huge
stride
towards
me
then
stood
groaning
and
rolling
her
eyes
cried
i
half
frantic
help
i
was
stopped
by
a
suppressed
titter
of
infernal
laughter
as
if
from
many
demons
and
on
looking
towards
the
black
curtain
whence
the
sound
came
i
saw
it
agitated
and
about
twenty
terrific
faces
appeared
peeping
through
slits
in
it
and
making
grins
of
a
most
diabolical
nature
i
hid
my
face
in
my
hands
the
banditti
cried
my
mother
as
she
spoke
the
door
opened
a
bandage
was
flung
over
my
eyes
and
i
was
hurried
off
almost
senseless
in
some
one
arms
till
at
length
i
found
myself
alone
in
my
own
chamber
such
was
the
detestable
adventure
of
oh
biddy
that
i
should
have
lived
to
meet
this
mother
of
mine
how
different
from
the
mothers
that
other
heroines
contrive
to
rummage
out
in
northern
turrets
and
ruined
chapels
i
am
out
of
all
patience
liberate
her
i
will
of
course
and
make
a
suitable
provision
for
her
when
i
get
possession
of
my
property
but
positively
never
will

under

a
a
an
original
reflection
on
the
heroine
the
landscape
not
an
awful
reason
given
one
evening
the
baroness
de

having
sprained
her
left
leg
in
the
composition
of
an
ecstatic
ode
resolved
not
to
go
to
lady
penthesilea
rouge
rout
while
she
was
sitting
alone
at
a
plate
of
prawns
the
footman
entered
with
a
basket
which
had
just
been
left
for
her
it
down
john
said
she
touching
his
forehead
with
her
fork
that
young
fellow
did
as
he
was
desired
and
capered
out
of
the
room
judge
of
her
astonishment
when
she
found
on
opening
it
a
little
cherub
of
a
baby
sleeping
within
an
oaken
cross
with
inscribed
in
chalk
was
appended
at
its
neck
and
a
mark
like
a
bruised
gooseberry
added
interest
to
its
elbow
as
she
and
her
lord
never
had
children
at
least
she
could
answer
for
herself
she
determined
le
on
adopting
the
pretty
hysterica
fifteen
years
did
this
worthy
woman
dedicate
to
the
progress
of
her
little
charge
and
in
that
time
taught
her
every
mortal
accomplishment
her
sigh
particularly
was
esteemed
the
softest
in
europe
but
the
stroke
of
death
is
inevitable
come
it
must
at
last
and
neither
virtue
nor
wisdom
can
avoid
it
in
a
word
the
good
old
baroness
died
and
our
heroine
fell
senseless
on
her
body
o
what
a
fall
was
there
my
countrymen
but
it
is
now
time
to
describe
our
heroine
as
milton
tells
us
that
eve
was
lovely
than
an
imaginary
lady
who
never
existed
but
in
the
brains
of
poets
so
do
we
declare
and
are
ready
to
stake
our
lives
that
our
heroine
excelled
in
her
form
the
timinitilidi
whom
no
man
ever
saw
and
in
her
voice
the
music
of
the
spheres
which
no
man
ever
heard
perhaps
her
face
was
not
perfect
but
it
was
more
it
was
interesting
it
was
oval
her
eyes
were
of
the
real
original
old
blue
and
her
eyelashes
of
the
best
silk
you
forget
the
thickness
of
her
lips
in
the
casket
of
pearls
which
they
enshrined
and
the
roses
of
york
and
lancaster
were
united
in
her
cheek
a
nose
of
the
grecian
order
surmounted
the
whole
such
was
hysterica
but
alas
misfortunes
are
often
gregarious
like
sheep
for
one
night
when
our
heroine
had
repaired
to
the
chapel
intending
to
drop
her
customary
tear
on
the
tomb
of
her
sainted
benefactress
she
heard
on
a
sudden
oh
horrid
horrible
and
horridest
horror
the
distant
organ
peal
a
solemn
voluntary
while
she
was
preparing
in
much
terror
and
astonishment
to
accompany
it
with
her
voice
four
men
in
masks
rushed
from
among
some
tombs
and
bore
her
to
a
carriage
which
instantly
drove
off
with
the
whole
party
in
vain
she
sought
to
soften
them
by
swoons
tears
and
a
simple
little
ballad
they
sat
counting
murders
and
not
minding
her
as
the
blinds
of
the
carriage
were
closed
the
whole
way

wave
a
description
of
the
country
which

traversed

the
prospect
within

the
reader

of

she
fainted
on
the
second
day
the
carriage
stopped
at
an
old
castle
and
she
was
conveyed
into
a
tapestried
apartment
where
the
delicate
creature
instantly
fell
ill
of
an
inverted
eyelash
caused
by
continual
weeping
she
then
drew
upon
the
contemplation
of
future
sorrows
for
a
supply
of
that
melancholy
which
her
immediate
exigencies
demanded

that
to

impressed
with

conviction
of

important
precept
our
heroine

smiled
as
she
heard

lock
her
door
it
was
now
midnight
and
she
took
up
her
lamp
to
examine
the
chamber
rusty
daggers
mouldering
bones
and
ragged
palls
lay
scattered
in
all
the
profusion
of
feudal
plenty
several
horrors
now
made
their
appearance
but
the
most
uncommon
was
a
winged
eyeball
that
fluttered
before
her
face
say
little
foolish
fluttering
thing
she
began
shrieking
and
adjusting
her
hair
at
a
mirror
when
lo
she
beheld
the
reflection
of
a
ghastly
visage
peeping
over
her
shoulder
much
disconcerted
the
trembling
girl
approached
the
bed
an
impertinent
apparition
with
a
peculiar
nose
stood
there
and
made
faces
at
her
she
felt
offended
at
the
freedom
to
say
nothing
of
her
being
half
dead
with
fright
it
not
enough
thought
she
be
harassed
by
beings
of
this
world
but
those
of
the
next
too
must
think
proper
to
interfere
i
am

she
as
she
raised
her
voice
in

manner

just
advise

not
the
i
believe
to
think
less
of
concerns
and
more
of
having
thus
asserted
her
dignity
without
being
too
personal
she
walked
to
the
casement
in
tears
and
sang
these
simple
lines
which
she
graced
with
intermittent

passing
along

alley
he
perceived
a
candle
lighting
in
a
small
window
on
the
of
a
deciduous
hovel
an
indescribable
sensation
an
unaccountable
something
whispered
to
him
in
still
small
accents
through
the
pane
he
did
so
but
what
were
his
emotions
when
he
beheld
whom
why
the
very
young
lady
that
he
had
left
for
dead
in
the

his
hysterica
she
was
clearstarching
in
a

bedgown
he
sleeked
his
eyebrows
with
his
finger
then
flung
open
the
sash
and
stood
before
her

he

lord

rushed
at

that
stood
on
the
dresser
and
poured
half
a
pint
of
it
into
her
mouth
but
perceiving
by
the
colour
that
it
was
not
water
he
put
it
to
his
lips
it
was
brandy
in
a
paroxysm
of

he
swallowed
the
contents
and
at
the

of

he

not

and

him
but
to
return
next
morning
the
lovers
woke
in
full
possession
of
their
faculties
when
the
happiest
took
place
hysterica
told
theodore
that
she
had
extricated
herself
from
the
snow
at
the
risk
of
her
life
in
fact
she
was
obliged
to
pelt
it
away
in
balls
and
theodore
now
recollected
having
been
hit
with
one
during
his
search
for
her
fearful
of
returning
to
the
castle
she
walked
and
officiated
there
in
the
respective
capacities
of

milliner
own
woman
and
washerwoman
her
honour
too
was
untarnished
though
a
hulking
porter
had
paid
her
the
most
delicate
attentions
and
assured
her
that
theodore
was
married
to
cruel
barbara
allen
theodore
called
down
several
stars
to
witness
his
unalterable
love
and
as
a

of
the

offered
to
marry

being
now
removed
she
beamed
an
inflammatory
glance

deposited
a

on

was
the
rosy
result

of

adieu
letter
xxxii
the
morning
of
the
ball
i
awoke
without
any
remains
of
my
late
indisposition
except
that
captivating
paleness
that
sprinkling
of
lilies
which
adds
to
interest
without
detracting
from
beauty
i
rose
with
the
sun
and
taking
a
small
china
vase
in
my
hand
tripped
into
the
parterre
to
collect
the
fresh
and
fragrant
dew
that
glistened
on
the
blossoms
i
filled
the
piece
of
painted
earth
with
the
nectar
of
the
sky
and
returned
during
the
day
i
took
nothing
but
honey
milk
and
dried
conserves
a
repast
the
most
likely
to
promote
that
ethereal
character
which
i
purposed
adopting
at
night
towards
evening
i
laved
my
limbs
in
a
tepid
bath
and
as
soon
as
the
sun
had
waved
his
last
crimson
banner
in
the
west
i
began
my
toilette
so
variable
is
fashion
that
i
determined
not
to
dress
according
to
its
existing
laws
since
they
might
be
completely
exploded
in
a
month
and
at
all
events
by
the
time
my
life
is
written
they
will
have
become
quite
antiquated
for
instance
do
we
not
already
abhor
evelina
and
harriet
byron
powdered
pomatumed
and
frizzled
hair
it
was
therefore
my
plan
to
dress
in
imitation
of
classical
models
and
to
copy
the
immortal
toilette
of
greece
having
first
divested
myself
from
head
to
foot
of
every
habiliment
i
took
a
long
piece
of
the
finest
cambric
and
twice
wound
it
gracefully
round
my
shoulders
and
bosom
and
twice
enveloped
my
form
in
its
folds
which
while
they
delineated
the
outline
of
my
shape
veiled
the
tincture
of
my
skin
i
then
flung
over
it
a
drapery
of
embroidered
gauze
and
its
unimplicated
simplicity
gave
to
my
perfect
figure
the
spirit
of
an
antique
statue
an
apparent
tissue
of
woven
air
it
fell
like
a
vapour
round
me
a
zone
of
gold
and
a
clasp
prettily
imprisoned
my
waist
and
my
graceful
arms
undegraded
by
gloves
were
bare
to
the
shoulder
part
of
my
hair
was
confined
by
a
bodkin
and
part
floated
over
my
neck
in
native
ringlets
as
i
could
not
well
wear
my
leg
naked
i
drew
on
it
a
texture
of
woven
silk
and
laced
a
pair
of
sandals
over
my
little
foot
which
resembled
that
of
a
youthful
thetis
or
of
a
fugitive
atalanta
i
then
bathed
my
face
with
the
dew
which
i
had
gathered
in
the
morning
poured
on
my
hair
and
bosom
the
balmy
waters
of
the
distilled
rose
and
sprinkled
my
drapery
with
fragrant
floods
of
lavender
so
that
i
might
be
said
to
move
in
an
ambient
atmosphere
of
odours
behold
me
now
dressed
to
a
charm
to
a
criticism
here
was
no
sloping
or
goring
or
seaming
or
frilling
or
flouncing
detestable
mechanism
of
millinery
no
tedious
papillotes
or
unpoetical
pins
were
here
all
was
done
in
a
few
minutes
with
a
clasp
a
zone
and
a
bodkin
as
i
surveyed
my
form
in
the
mirror
i
was
enraptured
at
its
sylphic
delicacy
but
i
trembled
to
reflect
that
the
fairest
flowers
are
the
most
fragile
you
would
imagine
that
a
maiden
sigh
could
dissipate
the
drapery
and
its
aerial
effect
was
as
if
a
fairy
were
to
lift
the
filmy
gossamer
on
her
spear
and
lightly
fling
it
over
a
resolving
not
to
make
myself
visible
till
all
the
guests
had
arrived
i
sat
down
and
read
ossian
to
store
my
mind
with
ideas
for
conversation
i
love
ossian
it
is
so
sublime
so
bewildered
so
full
of
a
blue
and
white
melancholy
of
ghosts
and
the
four
elements
i
likewise
turned
over
other
books
for
as
i
had
never
mixed
in
fashionable
society
i
could
not
talk
that
nothingness
which
is
every
thing
in
high
life
nor
indeed
if
i
could
would
i
because
as
a
heroine
it
was
my
part
to
converse
with
point
flowers
and
sublimation
about
to
appear
in
a
world
where
all
was
new
to
me
ignorant
of
its
forms
inexperienced
in
its
rules
fair
young
and
original
i
resolved
on
adopting
such
manners
as
should
not
be
subject
to
place
time
accident
or
fashion
in
short
to
copy
universal
generalized
unsophisticated
nature
and
grecian
statues
as
i
had
studied
elegance
of
attitude
before
i
knew
the
world
my
graces
were
original
and
all
my
own
creation
so
that
if
i
had
not
the
temporary
mannerisms
of
a
marchioness
i
had
at
least
the
immortal
movements
of
a
seraph
words
may
become
obsolete
but
the
language
of
gesture
is
universal
and
eternal
as
for
smiles
i
felt
myself
perfect
mistress
of
all
that
were
ever
ascribed
to
heroines
the
fatal
smile
the
smile
such
as
precedes
the
dissolution
of
sainted
goodness
the
fragment
of
a
broken
smile
and
the
sly
smile
that
creates
the
little
dimple
on
the
left
side
of
the
little
mouth
at
length
the
most
interesting
moment
of
my
life
arrived
the
moment
when
i
was
to
burst
like
a
new
planet
on
the
fashionable
hemisphere
i
descended
the
stairs
and
pausing
at
the
door
tried
to
tranquillize
my
fluttered
spirits
i
then
assumed
an
figure
scarcely
touching
the
ground
and
glided
into
the
room
the
company
were
walking
in
groups
or
sitting
is
she
there
she
is
look
look
was
whispered
on
all
sides
every
eye
fixed
itself
upon
me
while
i
felt
at
once
elevated
and
opprest
lady
gwyn
advanced
took
my
hand
and
paying
me
the
highest
compliments
on
my
appearance
led
me
to
a
sofa
at
the
upper
end
of
the
room
a
semicircle
of
astonished
admirers
head
over
head
ranged
itself
in
my
front
and
a
smile
of
glowing
approbation
illuminated
the
faces
of
all
there
i
sat
in
all
the
bashful
diffidence
of
a
simple
and
inexperienced
recluse
trembling
for
myself
fearing
for
others
systematically
suppressing
my
feelings
impulsively
betraying
them
while
with
an
expression
of
sweet
wildness
and
retiring
consciousness
was
observable
a
degree
of
susceptibility
too
exquisite
to
admit
of
lasting
peace
at
last
a
spruce
and
puny
fop
stepped
from
amidst
the
group
and
seated
himself
beside
me
was
a
fine
day
said
he
as
he
admired
the
accurate
turn
of
his
ankle
answered
i
was
the
morn
when
i
strayed
into
the
garden
to
gather
flowery
dew
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
twins
of
latona
had
met
to
propitiate
their
rites
blushes
like
their
own
roses
coloured
the
vapours
and
rays
pure
as
their
thoughts
silvered
the
foliage
the
company
murmured
applause
a
pity
said
he
this
evening
was
wet
as
in
consequence
of
it
we
have
probably
lost
another
beautiful
description
from
you
my
good
friend
cried
i
wreathing
my
favourite
smile
and
laying
the
rosy
tip
of
my
finger
on
his
arm
is
the
state
of
man
his
morning
rises
in
sunshine
and
his
evening
sets
in
rain
while
the
company
were
again
expressing
their
approbation
i
overheard
one
of
them
whisper
to
the
fop
play
the
girl
off
and
let
her
have
your
best
nonsense
the
fop
winked
at
him
and
then
turned
to
me
while
i
sat
shocked
and
astonished
but
collecting
all
my
powers
said
he
you
have
fascinated
every
eye
actually
you
are
the
with
all
your
swarm
about
you
with
my
drone
too
said
i
bowing
slightly
in
being
a
drone
said
he
he
but
sips
of
your
honey
say
cried
i
he
deserves
my
sting
said
he
laying
his
hand
on
his
heart
eyes
have
fixed
a
sting
here
your
tongue
returned
i
rather
more
innocent
for
though
it
may
have
the
venom
of
a
sting
it
wants
the
point
the
company
laughed
and
he
coloured
i
tease
you
said
he
trying
to
rally
cruel
actually
i
am
so
abashed
as
you
may
see
that
my
modesty
flies
into
my
face
said
i
modesty
must
be
very
hard
run
for
a
refuge
here
the
room
echoed
with
acclamations
am
not
at
a
loss
for
an
answer
said
he
looking
round
him
and
forcing
a
smile
am
not
indeed
pray
let
me
have
it
said
i
folly
never
becomes
truly
ludicrous
till
it
tries
to
be
pert
bravo
cried
an
hundred
voices
at
once
and
away
the
little
drone
flew
from
my
hive
i
tossed
back
my
ringlets
with
an
infantine
shake
of
the
head
and
sat
as
if
unconscious
of
my
triumph
the
best
of
it
is
that
every
word
he
said
will
one
day
appear
in
print
men
who
converse
with
a
heroine
ought
to
talk
for
the
press
or
they
will
make
but
a
silly
figure
in
her
memoirs
thank
you
for
your
spirit
my
dear
said
lady
gwyn
sitting
down
beside
me
little
puppy
deserves
every
severity
think
of
his
always
sitting
in
his
a
full
hour
after
he
has
shaved
that
the
blood
may
subside
from
his
face
he
protests
his
surprise
how
men
can
find
pleasure
in
running
after
a
nasty
fox
cuts
out
half
his
own
coat
at
his
tailor
has
a
smile
and
a
pretty
for
every
one
and
every
thing
sits
silent
till
one
of
his
four
only
topics
is
introduced
and
then
lisping
a
descant
on
the
last
opera
the
last
the
last
race
or
the
last
play
he
drains
his
last
idea
and
has
nothing
at
your
service
for
the
remainder
of
the
night
but
an
assenting
bow
such
insects
should
never
come
out
but
at
and
even
then
only
in
a
bandbox
while
monkeys
strew
the
way
with
mignionette
no
i
can
never
forgive
him
for
having
gone
to
lady
bontein
last
rout
in
preference
to
mine
though
he
knew
that
she
gave
her
on
the
same
evening
purposely
to
thin
my
party
pray
said
i
is
lady
bontein
tall
personage
yonder
with
sorrel
hair
answered
her
ladyship
with
one
shoulder
of
the
gothic
order
and
the
other
of
the
corinthian
she
has
now
been
forty
years
endeavouring
to
look
handsome
and
she
still
thinks
that
by
diligent
perseverance
she
will
succeed
at
last
see
how
she
freshens
her
smiles
and
labours
to
look
at
ease
though
she
has
all
the
awkwardness
of
a
milkmaid
without
any
of
the
simplicity
you
must
know
she
has
pored
over
latin
till
her
mind
has
become
as
dead
as
the
language
itself
then
she
writes
sonnets
about
a
tear
or
a
primrose
or
a
daisy
but
nothing
larger
than
a
lark
and
talks
botany
with
the
men
as
she
thinks
that
science
is
a
sufficient
excuse
for
indecency
nay
the
meek
creature
affects
the
bible
too
but
it
is
whispered
that
she
has
often
thrown
it
at
her
footman
head
without
any
affectation
at
all
but
the
magnificence
of
will
put
all
competition
out
of
her
power
and
i
have
also
planned
a
little
classical
appropriate
and
almost
unique
not
alone
in
order
to
complete
my
triumph
over
her
but
to
grace
your
entrance
into
life
by
conferring
a
peculiar
mark
of
distinction
on
you
me
cried
i
mark
i
deserve
no
mark
i
am
sure
you
do
said
she
the
world
knows
that
you
are
the
first
heroine
in
it
and
the
fact
is
i
mean
to
celebrate
your
merits
by
crowning
you
just
as
corinne
was
crowned
in
the
capitol
lady
gwyn
cried
i
panting
with
joy
you
are
not
ah
are
you
serious
serious
my
love
answered
she
in
a
short
time
the
ceremony
will
commence
you
may
perceive
that
the
young
men
and
girls
have
left
the
room
it
is
to
prepare
for
the
procession
and
now
excuse
me
as
i
must
assist
them
she
then
hurried
out
and
i
remained
half
an
hour
in
an
agony
of
anxious
expectation
at
last
i
heard
a
confused
murmur
at
the
door
and
a
gentleman
ran
forward
from
it
to
clear
a
passage
a
lane
was
soon
formed
of
the
guests
and
fancy
my
feelings
when
i
beheld
the
promised
procession
entering
first
appeared
several
little
children
who
came
tripping
towards
me
some
with
baskets
of
flowers
and
others
with
vases
of
odorous
waters
or
censers
of
fragrant
fire
after
them
advanced
a
tall
youth
of
noble
port
conspicuous
in
a
scarlet
robe
that
trailed
behind
him
with
graceful
dignity
on
his
head
was
a
plat
of
palm
in
his
left
hand
he
held
a
long
wand
and
in
his
right
the
destined
wreath
of
laurel
and
myrtle
behind
him
came
maidens
two
by
two
and
hand
in
hand
they
had
each
a
drapery
of
white
muslin
flung
negligently
round
them
and
knotted
just
under
the
shoulder
while
their
luxuriant
hair
floated
over
their
bosoms
the
youths
came
next
habited
in
flowing
vestments
of
white
linen
the
leader
approached
and
making
profound
obeisance
took
my
hand
i
rose
bowed
and
we
proceeded
with
a
slow
step
out
of
the
room
while
the
children
ran
before
us
tossing
their
little
censers
scattering
pansies
and
sprinkling
liquid
sweets
the
nymphs
and
youths
followed
in
couples
and
the
company
closed
the
procession
we
crossed
the
hall
ascended
the
winding
staircase
and
passed
along
the
corridor
till
we
reached
the
the
folding
doors
then
flew
open
as
if
with
wings
and
a
scene
presented
itself
which
almost
baffles
description
it
was
a
spacious
apartment
oval
in
its
form
and
walled
all
round
with
a
luxuriant
texture
of
interwoven
foliage
kept
compact
by
green
branches
of
the
broad
chesnut
and
arbutus
were
relieved
with
lauristinas
acacias
and
while
here
and
there
within
the
branches
appeared
clusters
of
lamps
that
mingled
their
coloured
rays
and
poured
a
flood
of
lustre
on
the
leaves
the
floor
was
chalked
into
circular
compartments
and
each
depicted
some
gentle
scene
of
romance
there
i
saw
mortimer
and
his
amanda
delville
and
his
cecilia
valencourt
and
his
emily
the
ceiling
was
of
moss
illuminated
with
large
circles
of
lamps
and
from
the
centre
of
each
circle
a
basket
was
seen
peeping
and
half
inverted
as
if
about
to
shower
its
ripe
fruits
and
chaplets
upon
our
heads
at
the
upper
end
of
the
room
i
beheld
a
large
arbour
elevated
on
a
gradual
slope
of
turf
its
outside
was
intertwined
with
jessamines
honeysuckles
and
eglantines
tufted
with
clumps
of
sunflowers
lilies
hollyhocks
and
a
thousand
other
blossoms
and
hung
with
clusters
of
grapes
and
trails
of
intricate
ivy
while
all
its
interior
was
so
studded
with
innumerable
lamps
that
it
formed
a
resplendent
arch
of
variegated
fire
the
seat
was
a
grassy
bank
strewn
with
a
profusion
of
aromatic
herbs
and
the
footstool
was
a
heap
of
roses
just
from
under
this
footstool
and
through
the
turf
came
gushing
a
little
rill
that
first
tumbled
its
warbling
waters
down
some
rugged
stones
and
then
separating
itself
to
the
right
and
left
ran
along
a
pebbled
channel
bordered
with
flowery
banks
till
it
was
lost
at
either
side
amidst
overshadowing
branches
the
moment
i
set
foot
in
the
room
a
stream
of
invisible
music
as
if
from
above
and
softened
by
distance
came
swelling
on
my
enraptured
ear
thrice
we
circled
this
enchanted
chamber
and
trod
to
the
solemn
measure
i
was
amazed
entranced
i
felt
elevated
to
the
empyrean
i
moved
with
the
grandeur
of
a
goddess
and
the
grace
of
a
vision
at
length
my
conductor
led
me
across
the
little
rill
into
the
bower
i
sat
down
and
he
stood
beside
me
the
children
lay
in
groups
on
the
grass
while
the
youths
and
virgins
ranged
themselves
along
the
opposite
side
of
the
streamlet
and
the
rest
of
the
company
stood
behind
them
the
master
of
this
august
ceremony
now
waved
his
wand
the
music
ceased
all
was
silent
and
he
thus
began
countrymen
and
countrywomen
your
cherubina
behold
the
most
celebrated
woman
in
our
island
need
i
recount
to
you
all
her
accomplishments
her
impassioned
sensibility
her
exquisite
art
in
depicting
the
delicate
and
affecting
relations
between
the
beauties
of
nature
and
the
deep
emotions
of
the
soul
need
i
dwell
on
those
elegant
adventures
those
sorrows
and
those
horrors
which
she
has
experienced
i
might
almost
say
sought
oh
no
the
whole
globe
already
resounds
with
them
and
their
fame
will
descend
to
the
most
remote
posterity
i
portray
her
eloquence
the
purity
of
her
style
and
the
smoothness
of
her
periods
are
not
her
ancestors
illustrious
are
not
her
manners
fascinating
alas
to
this
question
some
of
our
hearts
beat
audible
response
her
is
the
head
of
a
sappho
deficient
alone
in
the
voluptuous
languor
which
should
characterize
the
countenance
of
that
enamoured
lesbian
crown
her
therefore
as
the
patroness
of
arts
the
paragon
of
charms
and
the
first
of
heroines
is
to
gratify
our
feelings
more
than
her
own
by
enabling
us
to
pay
a
just
homage
to
beauty
and
to
virtue
he
ceased
amidst
thunders
of
applause
i
rose
and
in
an
instant
it
was
the
stillness
of
death
then
with
a
timorous
yet
ardent
air
i
thus
addressed
the
assembly
countrymen
my
countrywomen
will
not
thank
you
for
i
can
not
in
giving
me
cause
to
be
grateful
you
have
taken
from
me
the
means
of
expressing
my
gratitude
for
you
have
overpowered
me
i
happen
to
deserve
the
beautiful
eulogium
just
pronounced
i
am
sure
i
can
not
conceive
till
this
flattering
moment
i
never
knew
that
the
grove
resounds
with
my
praises
that
my
style
is
pure
and
my
head
a
sappho
but
unconsciousness
of
merit
is
the
characteristic
of
a
heroine
gratitude
however
which
my
words
can
not
express
my
deeds
shall
evince
and
i
now
pledge
myself
that
neither
rank
nor
riches
which
from
my
pursuits
i
am
peculiarly
liable
to
shall
ever
make
me
unmindful
of
what
i
owe
to
adversity
for
from
her
i
have
acquired
all
my
knowledge
of
the
world
my
sympathy
my
pensiveness
and
my
sensibility
yes
since
adversity
thus
adds
to
virtue
it
must
be
a
virtue
to
seek
adversity
my
friends
is
now
the
depository
of
all
that
remains
of
virtue
the
ark
that
floats
upon
the
waters
of
the
deluge
but
what
preserves
her
virtuous
her
women
and
whence
arises
their
purity
from
education
you
then
my
fair
auditory
i
would
enjoin
a
diligent
cultivation
of
learning
but
oh
beware
what
books
you
peruse
for
trust
me
some
are
as
injurious
as
others
are
salutary
i
can
not
point
out
to
you
the
mischievous
class
because
i
have
never
read
them
but
indubitably
the
most
useful
are
novels
and
romances
such
as
i
am
these
these
alone
have
made
me
these
by
depicting
heroines
sublimated
almost
to
immateriality
teach
the
common
class
of
womankind
to
reach
what
is
uncommon
by
striving
at
what
is
unattainable
to
despise
the
grovelling
follies
and
idlenesses
of
the
mere
worker
of
samplers
and
to
contract
a
taste
for
that
sensibility
whose
tear
is
the
dissolution
of
pearls
whose
blush
is
the
sunbeam
of
the
cheek
and
whose
sigh
is
more
costly
than
the
breeze
that
comes
laden
with
oriental
frankincense
i
spoke
and
peals
of
acclamation
shook
the
bower
the
priest
of
the
ceremony
now
raises
the
crown
on
high
then
lowers
it
by
slow
degrees
and
holds
it
suspended
over
my
head
letting
down
my
tresses
and
folding
my
hands
on
my
bosom
i
throw
myself
upon
my
knees
and
incline
forward
to
receive
it
i
am
crowned
at
the
same
moment
drums
and
trumpets
and
shouts
burst
upon
my
ear
in
a
hurricane
of
triumph
the
youths
and
maidens
make
obeisance
i
rise
press
my
hand
to
my
heart
and
bow
deeply
tears
start
into
my
eyes
i
feel
far
above
mortality
hardly
had
the
tumult
subsided
when
a
harp
was
brought
to
the
bower
and
they
requested
that
i
would
sing
and
play
an
improvisatore
like
corinne
what
was
i
to
do
for
i
knew
nothing
of
the
harp
but
a
few
chords
in
this
difficulty
i
luckily
recollected
a
heroine
who
was
educated
only
by
an
old
steward
and
his
old
wife
in
an
old
castle
with
an
old
lute
and
who
notwithstanding
as
soon
as
she
stepped
into
society
played
and
sang
like
angels
by
intuition
i
therefore
felt
quite
reassured
and
sat
to
the
harp
i
struck
a
few
low
lydian
notes
and
cast
a
timid
glance
around
me
at
first
my
voice
was
scarcely
louder
than
a
sigh
and
my
accompaniment
was
a
harmonic
chord
swept
at
intervals
the
words
came
from
the
moment
is
my
chief
said
the
daughter
of
erin
as
the
wave
kissed
her
foot
and
wherefore
went
he
from
his
weeping
maid
to
the
fight
of
heroes
she
saw
a
dim
form
rise
before
her
like
a
mist
from
the
valley
pale
grew
her
cheek
as
the
blighted
leaf
in
autumn
your
lover
it
shrilly
shrieked
sleeps
among
the
dead
like
a
broken
thistle
amidst
dandelions
but
his
spirit
like
the
thistly
down
has
ascended
into
the
skies
the
maiden
heard
she
ran
she
flew
she
sprang
from
a
rock
the
waves
closed
over
her
peace
to
the
daughter
of
erin
as
i
sang
ran
she
flew
the
workings
and
tremblings
of
the
minstrel
were
in
unison
while
my
winged
fingers
fluttered
along
the
chords
light
as
a
swallow
over
a
little
lake
when
he
touches
it
with
the
utmost
feather
of
his
pinion
but
while
i
sang
to
the
daughter
of
erin
my
voice
as
it
died
over
the
faint
vibration
of
the
strings
had
all
the
softness
of
an
eolian
lyre
so
woeful
was
it
so
wistful
so
wildered
viva
resounded
through
the
room
at
the
last
cadence
i
dropped
one
arm
gently
down
and
hanging
the
other
on
the
harp
leaned
my
languishing
head
upon
it
while
my
moistened
eyes
were
half
closed
a
sudden
disturbance
at
the
door
roused
me
from
my
trance
i
looked
up
and
beheld
what
can
you
imagine
what
no
my
friend
you
could
not
to
the
day
of
judgment
i
saw
in
short
my
great
mother
come
striding
towards
me
with
outspread
arms
and
calling
daughter
my
daughter
in
a
voice
that
might
waken
the
dead
my
heart
died
within
me
down
i
darted
from
the
bower
and
ran
for
shelter
behind
lady
gwyn
me
back
my
daughter
vociferated
the
dreadful
woman
advancing
close
to
her
ladyship
do
no
such
thing
whispered
i
pulling
her
ladyship
by
the
sleeve
half
all
my
property
but
do
not
be
the
death
of
me
are
you
muttering
there
miss
cried
my
mother
espying
me
makes
you
stand
peeping
over
that
wretch
shoulder
stammered
i
am
i
am
taking
your
part
could
have
presumed
to
liberate
this
woman
cried
lady
gwyn
condottieri
said
my
mother
by
the
great
damno
sulphureo
volcanoni
you
must
return
to
your
prison
this
moment
cried
lady
gwyn
my
mother
fell
on
her
knees
and
began
blubbering
while
the
guests
got
round
and
interceded
for
her
being
restored
to
liberty
i
too
thought
it
my
duty
to
say
something
my
mother
all
the
time
sobbing
horribly
till
at
length
lady
gwyn
consented
for
my
sake
she
said
to
set
the
poor
wretch
free
but
on
this
special
condition
that
there
should
be
no
prosecution
for
false
imprisonment
all
matters
being
amicably
adjusted
my
mother
begged
a
morsel
of
meat
as
she
had
not
eaten
any
these
ten
years
in
a
few
minutes
a
small
table
furnished
with
a
cold
turkey
and
a
decanter
of
wine
was
laid
for
her
in
the
bower
the
moment
she
perceived
it
she
ran
and
seating
herself
in
the
scene
of
my
recent
triumph
began
devouring
with
such
avidity
that
i
was
thunderstruck
one
wing
soon
went
the
second
shared
the
fate
of
its
companion
and
now
she
set
about
a
large
slice
of
the
breast
a
charming
appetite
your
dear
mother
has
got
said
several
of
the
guests
to
me
i
confessed
it
but
assured
them
that
inordinate
hunger
did
not
run
in
our
family
her
appetite
being
at
last
satiated
she
next
assailed
the
wine
glass
after
glass
disappeared
with
inconceivable
rapidity
and
every
glass
went
to
my
heart
will
be
quite
intoxicated
thought
i
while
my
fears
for
the
hereditary
honour
of
our
house
overcoming
my
personal
terrors
i
had
the
resolution
to
steal
across
and
whisper
if
you
have
any
regard
for
your
daughter
and
respect
for
your
ancestors
drink
no
more
more
than
this
decanter
upon
my
honour
said
she
applying
it
to
her
lips
at
this
moment
the
violins
struck
up
now
cried
my
mother
running
down
from
the
bower
is
for
a
dance
am
said
my
friend
the
little
fop
advancing
and
taking
her
hand
said
she
will
waltz
if
you
please
santa
maria
waltz
a
circle
was
cleared
and
they
began
whirling
each
other
round
at
a
frightful
rate
or
rather
she
him
for
he
was
like
a
plaything
in
her
hands
and
had
he
let
go
his
grasp
i
am
sure
he
would
have
been
flung
up
among
the
branches
and
have
stuck
there
like
king
charles
in
the
oak
at
last
while
i
was
standing
a
statue
of
shame
and
wondering
how
any
human
being
endowed
with
a
common
portion
of
reason
could
act
so
ridiculous
a
part
this
miserable
woman
overcome
with
wine
and
waltzing
fell
flat
upon
the
floor
and
was
carried
out
of
the
room
by
four
grinning
footmen
i
could
hold
no
longer
the
character
of
my
family
demanded
a
prompt
explanation
and
with
tears
in
my
eyes
i
desired
to
be
heard
silence
was
obtained
beseech
of
this
assembly
said
i
acquit
me
of
having
hand
act
or
part
in
the
conduct
of
that
unfortunate
person
i
never
even
saw
her
till
i
came
to
this
house
and
that
i
may
never
see
her
again
i
pray
heaven
i
hate
her
i
dread
her
and
i
now
protest
in
the
most
unequivocal
manner
that
i
do
not
believe
her
to
be
my
mother
at
all
she
has
no
resemblance
to
the
portrait
in
the
gallery
and
as
she
was
stark
mad
when
found
in
the
woods
she
perhaps
imagined
herself
my
mother
for
i
am
told
that
mad
persons
are
apt
to
fancy
themselves
great
people
no
my
malignant
star
ordained
us
to
meet
that
she
might
place
me
in
awkward
situations
by
her
vulgarity
just
as
garnet
the
supposed
mother
of
the
beggar
girl
used
to
place
that
heroine
i
am
sure
this
is
the
case
nothing
can
convince
me
to
the
contrary
and
therefore
i
thus
publicly
renounce
disown
and
wash
my
hands
of
her
now
and
for
ever
the
company
coincided
in
my
sentiments
and
applauded
my
determination
country
dancing
was
then
proposed
the
men
sauntered
about
the
room
for
partners
the
mothers
walked
their
daughters
up
and
down
to
shew
their
paces
and
their
daughters
turned
away
their
heads
when
they
saw
their
favourites
approaching
to
ask
them
ugliness
and
diamonds
occupied
the
top
of
the
set
the
beauties
stood
in
the
centre
and
the
motley
couples
came
last
old
bachelors
with
misses
of
fifteen
and
boys
who
were
glad
to
be
thought
men
with
antiques
who
were
sorry
to
be
called
maids
other
unfortunates
drest
to
a
pin
yet
noticed
by
nobody
sat
protruding
the
supercilious
lip
at
a
distance
and
now
the
merry
maze
commenced
but
what
mutilated
steps
what
grotesque
graces
one
girl
sprang
and
sprawled
to
the
terror
of
every
ankle
and
with
a
clear
idea
of
space
shewed
that
she
had
no
notion
of
time
another
not
deigning
to
dance
only
moved
while
her
poor
partner
was
seen
helping
her
in
like
a
tired
jade
to
the
distance
post
this
bartered
elegance
for
a
flicflac
that
swam
down
the
set
a
third
cut
her
way
through
it
and
a
fourth
who
by
her
longevity
could
not
be
dancing
for
a
husband
appeared
by
her
earnestness
to
be
dancing
for
her
life
all
this
delighted
me
highly
for
it
would
shew
my
graces
to
the
greater
advantage
my
partner
was
the
gentleman
who
had
crowned
me
and
now
when
our
turn
to
dance
down
came
a
general
whisper
among
the
spectators
and
their
sudden
hurry
towards
me
proved
that
much
was
expected
from
my
performance
i
would
not
disappoint
them
for
worlds
besides
it
was
incumbent
on
me
to
stamp
a
marked
dissimilarity
between
my
supposed
mother
and
myself
in
every
thing
and
to
call
forth
respect
and
admiration
as
much
as
she
had
excited
derision
and
contempt
and
now
with
my
right
foot
behind
and
the
point
of
it
but
just
touching
the
ground
i
leaned
forward
on
my
left
and
stood
as
if
in
act
to
ascend
from
this
vale
of
tears
to
regions
of
interminable
beatitude
the
next
moment
the
music
gave
the
signal
and
i
began
despising
the
figure
of
the
common
i
meandered
through
all
the
intricacies
of
the
dance
of
ariadne
imitating
in
my
circular
and
oblique
motions
the
harmonious
movement
of
the
spheres
and
resembling
in
my
light
and
playful
form
the
horoe
of
bathycles
as
they
appeared
in
the
temple
of
amycla
sometimes
with
a
rapid
flight
and
glowing
smile
i
darted
like
a
herald
iris
through
the
mazes
of
the
set
sometimes
assuming
the
dignity
of
a
young
diana
i
floated
in
a
swimming
languishment
and
sometimes
like
a
pastoral
nymph
of
languedoc
capriciously
did
i
bend
my
head
on
one
side
and
dance
up
insidious
what
a
hebe
i
happened
not
to
see
my
partner
from
the
time
i
began
till
i
had
ended
but
when
panting
and
playful
i
flew
like
a
lapwing
to
my
seat
he
followed
and
requested
that
i
would
accept
the
assurances
of
his
high
admiration
soon
afterwards
waltzing
was
introduced
have
already
imitated
ida
dancing
said
he
you
now
imitate
charlotte
and
allow
me
like
werter
to
hold
in
my
arms
the
most
lovely
of
women
to
fly
with
her
like
the
wind
and
lose
sight
of
every
other
object
i
consented
he
led
me
forth
and
clasping
my
waist
began
the
circuitous
exercise
of
waltzing
round
and
round
we
flew
and
swifter
and
swifter
till
my
head
grew
quite
giddy
lamps
trees
dresses
faces
all
seemed
to
be
shattered
and
huddled
together
and
sent
whisking
round
the
room
in
a
vortex
but
oh
my
friend
how
shall
i
find
language
to
describe
the
calamitous
termination
of
an
evening
so
propitious
in
its
commencement
i
blush
as
i
write
it
till
the
reflected
crimson
dyes
my
paper
for
in
the
midst
of
my
rotatory
motion
while
heaven
seemed
earth
and
earth
seemed
heaven
the
zone
on
which
all
my
attire
depended
and
by
which
it
was
all
confined
on
a
sudden
burst
asunder
and
in
the
next
whirl
more
than
half
of
my
dress
dropped
at
my
feet
another
revolution
and
i
had
acted
diana
to
fifty
acteons
but
i
shrieked
and
extricating
myself
from
my
partner
sank
on
the
floor
amidst
the
wreck
of
my
drapery
the
ladies
ran
ranged
themselves
round
me
and
cast
a
mantle
over
my
charms
i
was
too
much
shocked
and
indeed
too
giddy
to
move
so
they
lifted
me
between
them
and
bore
me
in
slow
procession
out
of
the
room
it
was
the
funeral
of
modesty
but
the
pall
was
supported
by
tittering
malice
i
hurried
into
bed
and
cried
myself
asleep
i
can
not
think
much
less
write
of
this
disaster
with
common
fortitude
i
wonder
whether
thompson
musidora
could
be
considered
a
sufficient
precedent
or
at
least
a
palliative
parallel
if
not
and
that
my
biographer
records
it
i
am
undone
adieu
letter
xxxiii
yesterday
lady
gwyn
took
me
at
my
particular
request
to
visit
monkton
castle
an
old
ruin
within
three
miles
of
us
and
as
it
forms
part
of
that
property
which
she
holds
at
present
it
is
mine
to
all
intents
and
purposes
the
was
stopped
up
with
stones
so
that
i
could
not
take
a
survey
of
its
interior
but
outside
it
looked
desolate
enough
i
mean
at
some
future
period
to
furnish
it
like
udolpho
and
other
castles
of
romance
and
to
reside
there
during
the
howling
months
after
dinner
her
ladyship
went
to
superintend
the
unpacking
of
some
beautiful
china
which
had
just
arrived
from
london
and
i
was
left
alone
on
the
sofa
evening
had
already
begun
to
close
a
delicious
indolence
thrilled
through
my
limbs
and
i
felt
all
that
lassitude
and
vacuity
which
the
want
of
incident
ever
creates
there
even
some
youth
in
the
house
thought
i
would
conceive
an
unhappy
attachment
for
me
had
her
ladyship
but
a
persecuting
son
what
scenes
might
happen
suppose
at
this
moment
the
door
were
to
be
thrown
open
and
he
to
enter
with
a
quick
step
and
booted
and
spurred
he
starts
on
seeing
me
never
had
i
looked
so
lovely
murmurs
he
a
divinity
then
suddenly
recollecting
himself
he
advances
with
a
respectful
bow
this
intrusion
says
he
i
really
i
i
rise
and
colouring
violently
mutter
without
looking
at
him
wonder
where
her
ladyship
can
be
but
as
i
am
about
to
pass
him
he
snatches
my
hand
and
leading
me
back
to
the
sofa
says
me
to
detain
you
a
moment
this
occasion
so
long
desired
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
relinquish
prevented
by
the
jealous
care
of
a
too
fond
mother
from
appearing
before
you
i
have
sought
and
found
a
thousand
opportunities
on
the
stairs
in
the
garden
in
the
shrubbery
to
behold
those
charms
fatal
opportunities
for
they
have
robbed
me
of
my
peace
for
ever
yes
charming
cherubina
you
have
undone
me
that
airy
yet
dignified
form
those
mild
yet
sparkling
eyes
those
lips
more
delicious
than
the
banquet
of
the
gods
signor
says
i
in
all
the
pleasing
simplicity
of
maiden
embarrassment
language
is
as
improper
for
me
to
hear
as
for
you
to
express
is
it
is
improper
cries
he
with
animation
it
is
inadequate
says
i
to
the
respect
i
deserve
as
the
guest
of
your
mother
exclaims
he
should
the
guest
imitate
the
harshness
of
the
hostess
she
may
not
says
i
the
follies
of
the
son
signor
i
desire
you
will
unhand
me
cries
he
till
you
say
you
pity
me
o
my
cherubina
o
my
soul
idol
and
he
drops
upon
his
knee
and
grasps
my
hand
when
behold
the
door
opens
and
lady
gwyn
appears
at
it
never
were
astonishment
and
dismay
equal
to
her
godfrey
says
she
this
the
conduct
that
i
requested
of
you
this
to
seek
clandestine
interviews
where
i
had
prohibited
even
an
open
acquaintance
and
for
thee
fair
unfortunate
turning
towards
me
with
that
mild
look
which
cuts
more
than
a
thousand
sarcasms
thee
lovely
frail
one
thou
must
seek
some
other
asylum
her
sweet
eyes
swim
in
tears
i
fling
myself
at
her
feet
am
innocent
i
cry
as
the
little
fawn
that
frisks
itself
to
repose
by
the
bubbling
fountain
she
smiles
incredulous
says
she
taking
my
hand
me
lead
you
to
your
apartment
in
mercy
stay
cries
godfrey
rushing
between
us
and
the
door
she
waves
him
aside
i
reach
my
room
nothing
can
console
me
i
am
all
despair
in
a
few
minutes
the
maid
taps
at
my
door
with
a
slip
of
paper
from
godfrey
cherubina
it
says
my
heart
is
torn
for
you
as
you
value
your
fame
perhaps
your
life
meet
me
at
twelve
in
the
shrubbery
after
a
long
struggle
i
resolve
to
meet
him
is
twelve
the
winds
are
abroad
the
shower
descends
i
fling
on
something
and
steal
into
the
shrubbery
i
find
him
there
before
me
he
thanks
me
ten
thousand
thousand
times
for
my
kindness
my
condescension
and
by
degrees
leads
me
into
the
avenue
where
i
see
a
chaise
in
waiting
i
shrink
back
he
prays
implores
and
at
length
snatching
me
in
his
arms
is
about
to
force
me
into
the
vehicle
when
on
a
sudden
villain
cries
a
voice
it
is
the
voice
of
stuart
i
shriek
and
drop
to
the
ground
the
clashing
of
swords
resounds
over
my
contested
body
and
i
faint
on
recovering
i
find
myself
in
a
small
but
decent
chamber
with
an
old
woman
and
a
beautiful
girl
watching
over
me
catherine
be
praised
exclaims
the
young
peasant
comes
to
herself
me
i
cry
he
murdered
gentleman
is
dead
sure
enough
miss
says
the
woman
i
laugh
frantic
and
point
my
finger
look
yonder
i
cry
his
mangled
corpse
mildly
smiling
even
in
death
see
they
fight
he
barbarous
godfrey
valiant
generous
unfortunate
stuart
and
hark
hear
you
that
is
the
bell
tolling
tolling
tolling
during
six
weeks
i
continue
in
this
dreadful
slowly
i
recover
a
low
melancholy
preys
upon
me
and
i
am
in
the
last
stage
of
a
consumption
but
though
i
lose
my
bloom
illness
touches
my
features
with
something
more
than
human
one
evening
i
had
got
my
chair
on
the
green
before
the
door
and
was
watching
the
sun
as
he
set
in
a
blaze
of
gold
oh
exclaimed
i
must
i
set
like
thee
fair
luminary
when
i
am
interrupted
by
a
stifled
sigh
just
behind
me
i
turn
heaven
and
earth
who
should
be
leaning
over
me
with
looks
of
unutterable
love
but
stuart
in
an
instant
i
see
him
i
shriek
i
run
i
leap
into
his
unfortunate
leap
for
it
wakened
me
from
a
delicious
reverie
and
i
found
myself
in
the
arms
not
of
stuart
but
of
the
old
butler
down
we
both
came
and
broke
in
pieces
a
superb
china
vase
which
he
was
just
bringing
into
the
room
will
my
lady
say
to
this
cried
he
rising
and
collecting
the
fragments
will
smile
with
ineffable
grace
answered
i
make
a
moral
reflection
on
the
instability
of
sublunary
things
he
shook
his
head
and
went
on
with
his
work
of
affliction
while
i
hastened
to
the
glass
where
i
found
my
face
flushed
from
my
reverie
my
hair
dishevelled
and
my
long
eyelashes
wet
with
tears
i
perceived
too
that
my
dress
had
got
a
terrible
rent
by
my
fall
hardly
had
i
recomposed
myself
when
her
ladyship
returned
and
called
for
tea
did
you
tear
your
robe
my
love
said
she
a
fall
that
i
got
just
now
replied
i
never
was
such
an
unfortunate
fall
child
said
she
rallying
me
a
martyr
to
the
tender
sensibilities
you
must
not
be
a
victim
to
torn
muslin
am
extremely
distressed
however
said
i
why
so
cried
she
was
an
accident
and
all
of
us
are
awkward
at
times
life
has
too
many
serious
miseries
to
admit
of
vexation
about
trifles
now
cried
i
with
delight
declare
i
told
the
butler
when
i
broke
the
china
vase
that
you
would
make
a
moral
reflection
the
oh
mercy
have
you
broken
my
beautiful
china
vase
it
to
atoms
answered
i
in
a
tone
of
the
most
assuasive
sweetness
did
exclaimed
she
in
a
voice
that
stunned
me
pray
how
dared
you
go
near
it
how
dared
you
even
look
at
it
you
who
are
not
fit
company
for
crockery
much
less
china
a
crazed
creature
that
i
brought
into
my
house
to
divert
my
guests
you
a
title
you
a
beauty
lady
gwyn
said
i
be
calm
under
this
calamity
trust
me
life
has
too
many
serious
miseries
to
admit
of
vexation
about
trifles
her
ladyship
rose
with
her
cheeks
inflamed
and
her
eyes
glittering
i
ran
out
of
the
room
in
much
terror
then
up
stairs
and
into
the
nearest
it
happened
to
be
her
ladyship
and
this
circumstance
struck
me
as
most
providential
for
in
her
present
mood
she
would
probably
compel
me
to
quit
the
house
so
that
i
could
never
have
another
opportunity
of
ransacking
her
caskets
and
cabinets
for
memorials
of
my
birth
i
therefore
began
the
search
but
in
the
midst
of
it
was
interrupted
by
hearing
a
small
voice
cry
out
much
amazed
i
looked
up
and
perceived
her
ladyship
favourite
parrot
in
its
cage
out
said
the
parrot
will
let
thee
out
cost
what
it
will
cried
i
so
with
much
sensibility
and
indeed
very
little
spleen
i
took
the
bird
and
put
it
out
at
the
window
after
having
accurately
examined
several
drawers
i
found
a
casket
in
one
of
them
opened
it
and
beheld
within
o
delightful
sight
a
miniature
set
round
with
inestimable
diamonds
and
bearing
a
perfect
resemblance
to
the
portrait
in
the
gallery
face
attitude
attire
every
thing
of
my
much
injured
house

i
depositing
the
picture
in
my
bosom
image
of
my
sainted
mother

will
i
part
with
thee

doing
in
my
room
cried
lady
gwyn
as
she
burst
into
it
is
this

my
dresses
about
the
floor
my
drawers
my
casket
open
and
as
i
live
here

the
miniature

thing

robbing

answered
i

my
family

recovered

at
last
and
let
me
see
who
will
dare
take
it
from
me
are
more
knave
than
fool
said
her
ladyship
it
back
this
instant
or
on
my
honour
i
will
expose
you
to
the
servants
is
the
use
of
bullying
said
i
you
are
ruined
should
this
swindling
affair
come
to
be
known
not
that
i
would
for
the
world
hang
your
ladyship
far
from
it
but
then
your
character
will
be
blasted
ah
lady
gwyn
where
is
your
hereditary
honour
where
is
your
prudence
where
is
your
dignity
is
my
parrot
shrieked
her
ladyship
the
radiant
air
exclaimed
i
life
and
fragrance
and
freedom
amidst
the
clouds
i
let
it
out
at
the
window
her
ladyship
ran
towards
me
but
i
passed
her
and
made
the
best
of
my
way
down
stairs
while
she
followed
calling
stop
thief
too
well
i
knew
and
rued
the
dire
expression
nor
stopped
an
instant
but
hurried
out
of
the
house
through
the
lawn
down
the
avenue
into
a
the
servants
in
hot
pursuit
not
a
moment
was
to
be
lost
a
drowning
man
you
know
will
grasp
at
straws
and
i
crept
for
refuge
under
a
heap
of
hay
but
whether
they
found
me
there
or
how
long
i
remained
or
what
has
become
of
me
since
or
what
is
likely
to
become
of
me
hereafter
you
shall
learn
in
my
next
adieu
letter
xxxiv
i
remained
in
my
disagreeable
situation
till
night
had
closed
and
the
pursuit
appeared
over
i
then
rose
and
walked
through
the
fields
without
any
settled
intention
terror
was
now
succeeded
by
bitter
indignation
at
the
conduct
of
lady
gwyn
who
had
dared
to
drive
me
from
my
own
house
and
vilify
me
as
a
common
thief
insupportable
insult
unparalleled
degradation
was
there
no
revenge
no
remedy
like
a
rapid
ray
from
heaven
a
thought
at
once
simple
and
magnificent
shot
through
my
brain
and
made
my
very
heart
bound
with
transport
when
i
name
monkton
castle
need
i
tell
you
the
rest
need
i
tell
you
that
i
determined
to
seize
on
that
antique
abode
of
my
ancestors
to
fortify
it
against
assaults
to
procure
domestics
and
suitable
furniture
for
it
and
to
reside
there
the
present
rival
and
the
future
victress
of
the
vile
lady
gwyn
let
her
dispossess
me
if
she
dare
or
if
she
can
for
i
have
heard
that
possession
is
a
great
number
of
points
of
the
law
in
one
favour
as
to
fitting
up
the
castle
that
will
be
quite
an
easy
matter
for
the
tradespeople
of
london
willingly
give
credit
for
any
amount
to
a
personage
of
rank
like
me
and
therefore
i
have
nothing
more
to
do
than
make
some
friend
there
bespeak
furniture
in
my
name
it
appeared
to
me
that
jerry
sullivan
was
the
most
eligible
person
i
could
select
so
now
a
light
heart
making
a
light
foot
i
tripped
back
to
the
road
and
took
my
way
towards
monkton
castle
for
the
purpose
of
procuring
an
asylum
in
some
cottage
near
it
and
writing
a
letter
of
instructions
to
jerry
it
was
starlight
and
i
had
walked
almost
three
miles
when
a
little
girl
with
a
bundle
of
sticks
on
her
back
overtook
me
and
began
asking
alms
in
the
midst
of
her
supplications
we
came
to
the
hut
where
she
lived
and
i
followed
her
into
it
with
the
hope
of
getting
a
lodging
there
or
at
least
a
direction
to
one
in
a
room
comfortless
with
walls
of
smoked
mud
i
found
a
wrinkled
and
decrepit
beldame
and
two
smutty
children
holding
their
hands
over
a
few
faded
embers
i
begged
permission
to
rest
myself
for
a
short
time
the
woman
after
looking
at
me
keenly
consented
and
i
sat
down
i
then
entered
into
conversation
represented
myself
as
a
wandering
stranger
in
distress
and
inquired
if
i
had
any
chance
of
finding
a
lodging
about
the
neighbourhood
the
woman
assured
me
that
i
had
not
and
on
perceiving
me
much
disconcerted
at
the
disappointment
coarsely
but
cordially
offered
me
her
hut
for
the
night
i
saw
i
had
nothing
for
it
but
to
remain
there
so
the
fire
was
replenished
some
brown
bread
and
sour
milk
the
last
of
their
store
produced
and
while
we
sat
round
it
i
requested
of
the
poor
woman
to
let
me
know
what
had
reduced
her
to
such
distress
she
told
me
with
many
tears
and
episodes
that
her
daughter
and
who
had
supported
her
died
about
a
month
ago
and
left
these
children
behind
without
any
means
of
subsistence
except
what
they
could
procure
from
the
charitable
all
their
appearances
corroborated
this
account
for
famine
had
set
its
meagre
finger
on
their
faces
i
wished
to
pity
them
but
their
whining
their
dirtiness
and
their
vulgarity
disgusted
more
than
interested
me
i
nauseated
the
brats
and
abhorred
the
haggard
hostess
how
it
happens
i
know
not
but
the
misery
that
looks
alluring
on
paper
is
almost
always
repulsed
in
real
life
i
turn
with
distaste
from
a
ragged
beggar
or
a
decayed
tradesman
while
the
recorded
sorrows
of
a
belfield
or
a
rushbrook
draw
tears
of
pity
from
me
as
i
read
at
length
we
began
to
think
of
rest
the
children
gave
me
their
pallet
i
threw
myself
upon
it
without
undressing
and
they
slept
on
some
straw
with
a
blanket
over
them
in
the
morning
we
presented
a
most
dismal
group
not
a
morsel
had
we
for
breakfast
nor
the
means
of
obtaining
any
the
poor
cripple
who
had
expected
some
assistance
from
me
sat
grunting
in
a
corner
the
children
whimpered
and
shivered
and
i
with
more
elegance
but
not
less
misery
chaunted
a
matin
to
the
virgin
i
then
began
seriously
to
consider
what
mode
of
immediate
subsistence
i
ought
to
adopt
and
at
last
i
hit
upon
a
most
pleasing
and
judicious
plan
as
some
days
must
elapse
between
my
writing
to
jerry
sullivan
and
his
coming
down
for
i
mean
to
have
him
here
if
possible
and
as
the
cottage
is
within
a
short
distance
from
the
castle
i
have
resolved
to
remain
with
my
hostess
till
he
shall
arrive
and
to
go
forth
every
day
in
the
character
of
a
like
another
rosa
i
will
earn
my
bread
by
asking
alms
my
simple
and
imploring
address
my
sigh
my
cheek
yet
traced
with
the
recent
tear
all
will
be
irresistible
even
the
shrivelled
palm
of
age
will
expand
at
my
supplication
and
the
youths
offering
compliments
with
eleemosynary
silver
will
call
me
the
lovely
vagabond
or
the
mendicant
angel
thus
my
few
days
of
beggary
will
prove
quite
delightful
and
oh
how
sweet
when
those
are
over
to
reward
and
patronize
as
lady
of
the
castle
those
hospitable
cottagers
who
have
pitied
and
sheltered
me
as
the
my
first
step
was
writing
to
jerry
sullivan
and
i
fortunately
found
the
stump
of
a
pen
some
thick
ink
and
coarse
paper
in
the
cottage

was
my
letter

lines

humble

is
precisely
the
formal
sort
of
letter
which
a
heroine
sometimes
indites
to
her
lover
he
can
not
for
the
soul
of
him
tell
why
so
down
he
comes
all
distracted
in
a
postchaise
and
makes
such
a
dishevelled
entrance
as
melts
her
heart
in
an
instant
and
the
scene
ends
with
his
arm
round
her
waist
adieu
letter
xxxv
as
i
was
now
about
to
go
begging
i
thought
it
necessary
to
look
like
a
beggar
so
i
dressed
myself
in
a
tattered
gown
cap
and
cloak
that
had
belonged
to
the
deceased
daughter
of
my
hostess
then
placing
my
mother
portrait
in
my
bosom
i
sallied
forth
and
took
the
road
to
the
neighbouring
village
being
sunday
the
rustics
looked
trim
and
festive
the
nymphs
and
youths
frolicked
along
the
grandsires
sat
at
their
doors
the
sun
was
shining
all
things
smiled
but
the
miserable
cherubina
at
length
i
reached
the
village
and
deposited
my
letters
for
the
post
the
church
imbosomed
in
trees
stood
at
a
little
distance
the
people
were
at
prayers
and
as
i
judged
that
they
would
soon
be
dismissed
i
placed
myself
at
the
sacred
gate
as
an
auspicious
station
for
the
commencement
of
my
supplicatory
career
in
a
short
time
they
began
to
leave
the
church
penny
for
the
poor
starving
girl
said
i
are
you
how
are
you
how
are
you
was
gabbled
on
all
sides
penny
one
penny
oh
one
penny
softly
faltered
i
it
was
the
cooing
of
a
dove
amidst
the
chattering
of
magpies
who
was
that
stranger
in
the
next
pew
said
one
lady
penny
for
the
love
of
seemed
to
think
herself
too
pretty
to
pray
said
another
penny
for
the
motion
does
not
become
her
lips
said
another
penny
for
the
love
of
charity
but
they
had
gotten
into
their
carriages
youth
innocence
and
distress
can
touch
your
hearts
said
i
following
some
gentlemen
down
the
road
the
destitute
orphan
the
hungry
vagrant
the
most
injured
and
innocent
of
her
sex
gentlemen
good
gentlemen
kind
gentlemen
to
hell
said
they
is
for
you
sweetheart
cried
a
coarse
voice
from
behind
while
a
halfpenny
jingled
at
my
foot
i
turned
to
thank
my
benefactor
and
found
that
he
was
a
drunken
man
in
the
stocks
disgusted
and
indignant
at
the
failure
of
my
first
attempt
i
hurried
out
of
the
village
and
strayed
along
addressing
all
i
met
but
all
appeared
too
gay
to
pity
misery
hour
after
hour
i
passed
in
fruitless
efforts
now
walking
now
sitting
till
at
length
day
began
to
close
and
fatigue
and
horrid
hunger
were
enfeebling
my
limbs
in
a
piteous
condition
i
determined
to
turn
my
steps
back
towards
the
cottage
for
night
was
already
blackening
the
blue
hemisphere
the
mountainous
clouds
hung
low
and
the
winds
piped
the
portentous
moan
of
a
coming
hurricane
by
the
little
light
that
still
remained
i
saw
a
long
avenue
on
my
left
which
i
thought
might
lead
to
some
hospitable
place
of
shelter
and
i
began
as
well
as
the
gloom
of
the
trees
would
permit
to
grope
my
way
through
it
after
much
labour
and
many
falls
i
came
to
an
opening
and
as
i
saw
no
house
i
still
walked
straight
forward
by
this
time
the
storm
had
burst
upon
my
head
with
tremendous
violence
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
i
could
keep
my
feet
at
last
i
fancied
i
could
perceive
a
building
in
front
and
i
bent
my
steps
towards
it
as
i
drew
nearer
i
found
my
way
sometimes
obstructed
by
heaps
of
stones
or
broken
columns
and
i
concluded
that
i
was
approaching
some
prodigious
castle
where
i
should
be
sure
to
find
shelter
horror
owls
and
one
of
my
near
relations
i
therefore
hastened
towards
it
and
soon
my
extended
hands
touched
the
structure
my
heart
struck
a
throb
of
joy
and
i
began
to
feel
along
the
wall
for
some
ruined
portal
or
archway
hardly
had
i
moved
ten
paces
when
my
groping
hands
plunged
into
unresisting
air
i
stopped
a
moment
then
entered
through
the
vacuity
and
to
my
great
comfort
found
myself
under
immediate
shelter
this
then
i
guessed
was
the
great
hall
of
the
castle
and
i
prepared
my
mind
for
the
most
terrible
things
i
had
not
advanced
three
yards
when
i
paused
in
much
terror
for
i
thought
i
heard
a
stir
just
beside
me
again
all
was
still
and
i
ventured
forward
i
now
fancied
that
i
heard
a
gentle
breathing
and
at
the
same
instant
i
struck
my
foot
against
something
which
with
a
sudden
movement
tripped
up
my
heels
and
down
i
came
shrieking
and
begging
for
mercy
while
a
frightful
bustle
arose
all
round
me
such
passing
and
repassing
rustling
and
rushing
that
i
gave
myself
over
for
lost
gentlemen
banditti
cried
i
my
persecuted
life
and
i
will
never
never
betray
you
they
did
not
answer
a
syllable
but
retired
to
some
distance
where
they
held
a
horrid
silence
in
a
few
minutes
i
heard
steps
outside
and
two
persons
entered
the
building
shelters
us
well
enough
said
one
of
them
on
the
storm
cried
the
other
will
hinder
any
more
of
them
from
coming
out
however
we
have
killed
four
already
and
please
goodness
not
one
will
be
alive
on
the
estate
this
day
month
oh
biddy
how
my
soul
sickened
at
the
shocking
reflection
that
four
of
a
family
were
already
murdered
in
cold
blood
and
that
the
rest
were
to
share
the
same
fate
in
a
month
unable
to
contain
myself
i
muttered
upon
me
mercy
upon
me
you
hear
that
whispered
one
of
the
men
did
said
the
other
with
us
this
moment
and
off
they
both
ran
i
too
determined
to
quit
this
nest
of
horrors
for
my
very
life
appeared
in
danger
so
rising
i
began
to
grope
my
way
towards
the
door
when
i
fell
over
something
that
lay
on
the
ground
and
as
i
put
out
my
hand
i
touched
oh
horrible
a
dead
cold
damp
human
face
instantly
the
thought
struck
me
that
this
was
one
of
the
four
whom
the
ruffians
had
murdered
and
i
flung
myself
from
it
with
a
shiver
of
horror
but
in
doing
so
laid
my
hand
on
another
face
while
a
faint
gleam
of
lightning
that
flashed
at
the
moment
shewed
me
two
bodies
pale
ghastly
naked
and
half
covered
with
straw
i
started
up
screaming
and
made
a
desperate
effort
to
reach
the
door
but
just
as
i
was
darting
out
of
it
i
found
my
shoulder
seized
with
a
ferocious
grasp
have
caught
one
of
them
cried
the
person
the
lantern
am
innocent
of
the
murder
cried
i
swear
to
you
that
i
am
they
did
not
fall
by
my
dagger
i
can
assure
you
what
murder
cried
he
help
here
is
a
murder
committed
by
me
cried
i
by
me
not
by
me
no
no
no
my
hands
are
unstained
with
their
blood
and
now
a
lantern
being
brought
i
perceived
several
servants
in
liveries
who
first
examined
my
features
and
then
dragged
me
back
into
the
building
while
they
searched
there
for
some
poachers
whom
they
had
been
when
they
found
me
the
building
and
what
was
the
building
think
you
why
nothing
more
than
the
shell
of
an
unfinished
house
a
mere
modern
morsel
of
a
tasteless
temple
and
what
were
the
banditti
who
had
knocked
me
down
think
you
why
nothing
more
than
a
few
harmless
sheep
that
now
lay
huddled
together
in
a
corner
and
what
were
the
two
corpses
think
you
why
nothing
more
than
two
heathen
statues
for
the
little
temple
and
the
ruffians
that
talked
of
their
having
killed
and
having
to
kill
were
only
the
poachers
who
had
killed
four
hares
here
then
was
the
whole
mystery
developed
and
a
great
deal
of
good
fright
gone
for
nothing
however
some
trouble
still
remained
to
me
the
servants
swearing
that
i
was
either
concerned
with
the
poachers
or
in
some
murder
dragged
me
down
a
shrubbery
till
we
reached
a
large
mansion
we
then
entered
a
lighted
hall
one
of
them
went
to
call
his
master
and
after
a
few
minutes
an
elderly
gentleman
with
a
troop
of
young
men
and
women
at
his
heels
came
out
of
a
parlour
that
the
murderess
what
a
young
murderess
i
never
saw
a
murderess
before
was
whispered
about
by
the
ladies
murder
is
this
you
were
talking
of
young
woman
said
the
gentleman
to
me
will
tell
you
with
pleasure
answered
i
must
know
that
i
am
a
wandering
without
home
parents
or
friends
and
when
the
storm
began
i
ran
for
shelter
into
the
temple
of
taste
as
your
servants
called
it
so
thinking
it
a
castle
and
some
sheep
which
threw
me
down
banditti
and
a
couple
of
statues
corpses
of
course
it
was
quite
natural
for
me
to
suppose
when
two
men
entered
and
began
to
talk
of
having
killed
something
that
they
meant
these
very
corpses
was
it
not
natural
now
and
so
that
is
the
plain
and
simple
narrative
of
the
whole
affair
to
my
great
surprise
a
general
burst
of
laughter
ran
round
the
hall
banditti
and
statues
corpses
dear
me
bless
me
well
to
be
sure
tittered
the
misses
woman
said
the
gentleman
incoherent
account
inclines
me
to
think
you
concerned
in
some
atrocious
transaction
which
i
must
make
it
my
business
to
discover
am
sure
said
a
young
lady
carries
the
gallows
in
her
face
so
pretty
a
gallows
said
a
young
gentleman
i
wish
i
were
hanging
upon
it
brother
said
the
young
lady
can
you
talk
so
to
a
murderess
how
can
you
talk
so
cried
i
you
know
me
to
be
a
murderess
it
is
not
just
it
is
not
generous
it
is
not
feminine
men
impelled
by
love
may
deprive
our
sex
of
virtue
but
we
ourselves
actuated
by
rancorous
not
gentle
impulses
rob
each
other
of
character
indeed
you
have
done
for
yourself
now
said
the
young
lady
sentence
of
morality
has
settled
you
completely
i
presume
you
do
not
admire
morality
said
i
from
the
lips
of
a
low
wretch
like
you
said
she
young
woman
cried
i
the
current
which
runs
through
these
veins
is
registered
in
hereditary
heraldry
the
company
gave
a
most
disgusting
laugh
is
cried
i
tell
you
it
is
i
tell
you
i
am
of
the
blood
noble
blood
squeaked
a
young
gentleman
what
wonder
that
i
forgot
my
prudence
amidst
these
indignities
yes
the
proud
spirit
of
my
ancestors
swelled
my
heart
all
my
house
stirred
within
me
and
the
blood
of
the
de
willoughbys
rose
into
my
face
as
i
drew
the
magnificent
picture
from
my
bosom
pointed
a
quivering
finger
at
it
and
exclaimed
the
portrait
of
my
titled
mother
see
cried
the
girls
crowding
round
covered
all
over
with
diamonds
flatter
myself
it
is
said
i
is
proof
irrefragable
for
you
enough
to
hang
you
i
fancy
cried
the
old
gentleman
snatching
it
out
of
my
hand
now
my
lady
you
must
march
to
the
magistrate
i
wept
knelt
entreated
all
was
in
vain
his
son
the
young
man
who
had
paid
my
face
the
compliment
took
charge
of
my
person
and
accompanied
by
the
servant
who
had
seized
me
set
off
with
me
to
the
magistrate
during
our
walk
he
tried
to
discover
how
i
had
got
possession
of
the
picture
but
i
was
on
my
guard
and
merely
replied
that
time
would
tell
my
innocence
on
a
sudden
he
desired
the
servant
to
go
back
for
an
umbrella
and
take
it
to
the
magistrate
after
him
the
man
having
left
us
said
the
you
are
a
pilferer
of
pictures
i
know
not
but
this
i
know
that
you
are
a
pilferer
of
hearts
and
that
i
am
determined
to
keep
you
in
close
custody
till
you
return
mine
which
you
have
just
stolen
to
be
plain
i
will
extricate
you
from
your
present
difficulty
and
conceal
you
in
a
cottage
just
at
hand
if
you
will
allow
me
to
support
and
visit
you
you
understand
me
the
blood
gushed
into
my
cheeks
as
he
spoke
but
however
indignant
i
felt
at
the
proposal
i
likewise
felt
that
it
would
be
prudent
to
dissemble
and
as
other
heroines
in
similar
predicaments
do
not
hesitate
to
hint
that
they
will
compromise
their
honours
i
too
determined
to
give
my
tempter
some
hope
and
thus
make
him
my
friend
till
i
could
extricate
myself
from
this
emergency
i
therefore
replied
that
i
trusted
he
would
not
find
me
deficient
in
gratitude
you
love
said
he
now
here
is
the
cottage
he
then
tapped
at
a
door
an
elderly
woman
opened
it
and
within
i
perceived
a
young
woman
with
a
bold
but
handsome
face
hastily
adjusting
her
cap
at
a
glass
have
brought
a
wretched
creature
said
he
i
found
starving
on
the
road
pray
take
care
of
her
and
give
her
some
refreshment
you
must
also
contrive
a
bed
for
her
the
women
looked
earnestly
at
me
and
then
significantly
at
each
other
shall
have
no
bed
in
my
house
said
the
elder
i
warrant
this
is
the
hussey
who
has
been
setting
you
against
poor
susan
in
order
to
get
you
herself
and
telling
you
lies
about
tommy
visiting
here
poor
girl
and
bob
saunders
cried
the
daughter
innocent
cried
the
mother
the
three
hawkins
cried
the
daughter
lamb
cried
the
mother
a
girl
too
that
never
looked
at
mortal
man
but
the
john
mullins
and
jacob
jones
and
patrick
cried
the
daughter
of
that
cried
the
mother
think
of
that
cried
the
daughter
the
abominable
man
oh
i
will
cut
my
throat
i
will
so
i
will
said
i
the
fatal
effects
of
licentious
love
here
is
a
girl
whom
your
money
perhaps
allured
from
the
paths
of
virtue
no
cried
susan
was
his
honour
handsome
face
and
his
fine
words
so
bleeding
and
so
sore
and
he
called
me
an
angel
above
the
heavens
said
i
is
the
tenderness
of
youth
the
smile
of
joy
the
blush
of
innocence
which
kindle
the
flame
of
the
seducer
and
yet
these
are
what
he
would
destroy
it
is
the
heart
of
sensibility
which
he
would
engage
and
yet
in
that
heart
he
would
plant
every
rankling
pang
every
bitter
misery
detestable
passion
which
accomplishes
the
worst
of
purposes
through
the
medium
of
the
best
and
sweetest
affections
she
whose
innocent
mind
ascribes
to
others
the
motives
that
actuate
itself
she
who
confides
because
she
would
not
deceive
she
who
has
a
tear
for
real
grief
and
who
melts
at
the
simulated
miseries
of
her
lover
she
soonest
falls
a
sacrifice
to
his
arts
while
the
cold
vestal
who
goes
forth
into
the
world
callous
to
feeling
and
armed
with
austerity
repulses
his
approaches
with
indignation
and
calls
her
prudence
virtue
the
young
man
gazed
on
me
with
surprise
and
the
mother
had
come
closer
but
susan
was
peeping
at
her
face
in
the
glass
on
that
beautiful
girl
before
you
cried
i
itself
is
not
brighter
than
her
brow
the
tints
of
the
morning
can
not
rival
her
blushes
susan
held
down
her
head
but
cast
an
under
glance
at
the
is
she
now
continued
i
too
soon
you
may
behold
her
pale
shivering
unsteady
of
step
and
hoarse
with
nocturnal
curses
one
of
those
unhappy
thousands
who
nightly
strew
our
streets
with
the
premature
ruins
of
dilapidated
beauty
look
at
her
look
at
her
cried
the
mother
who
flushing
even
through
her
wrinkles
and
quivering
in
every
limb
now
rushed
towards
her
daughter
and
snatching
off
her
cap
bared
her
forehead
at
her
she
was
once
my
lovely
pride
the
blessing
of
my
heart
and
see
what
he
has
now
made
her
for
me
while
i
miserable
as
i
am
must
wink
at
her
guilt
that
i
may
save
her
from
disgrace
and
ruin
then
cried
i
turning
to
the
still
some
portion
of
her
fame
remains
fly
from
her
fly
for
ever
certainly
mean
to
do
so
replied
he
pray
make
your
mind
easy
you
see
susan
by
this
young
woman
sentiments
that
she
can
not
be
what
you
suspected
her
i
am
convinced
susan
said
i
you
feel
grateful
for
the
pains
i
have
taken
to
reclaim
the
from
a
connection
so
fatal
to
you
both
am
quite
sure
i
do
sobbed
susan
i
will
pray
for
your
health
and
happiness
ever
while
i
live
so
dear
miss
since
i
must
lose
him
i
hope
you
will
coax
him
to
leave
me
some
money
first
not
that
i
ever
valued
him
for
his
money
but
you
know
i
could
not
see
my
mother
go
without
her
tea
creature
cried
i
i
will
intercede
for
you
giving
you
money
said
the
depend
on
my
finding
when
i
return
morning
that
you
have
treated
this
girl
well
will
treat
her
like
a
sister
said
susan
the
now
declared
that
he
must
be
gone
then
taking
me
aside
shall
see
you
early
whispered
he
remove
you
to
a
house
about
a
mile
hence
and
i
will
tell
my
father
that
you
ran
away
meantime
continue
to
talk
virtue
and
these
people
will
think
you
a
saint
he
then
bade
us
all
and
departed
instantly
i
set
my
wits
at
work
and
soon
hit
upon
a
plan
to
accomplish
my
escape
i
told
the
women
that
i
had
an
old
mother
about
a
mile
from
the
cottage
who
was
almost
starving
and
that
if
i
could
procure
a
little
silver
and
a
loaf
of
bread
i
would
run
to
her
hut
with
the
relief
and
return
immediately
to
describe
the
kind
solicitude
the
sweet
goodnature
that
mother
and
daughter
manifested
in
loading
me
with
victuals
and
money
were
impossible
suffice
it
that
they
gave
me
some
bread
tea
and
sugar
and
susan
herself
offered
to
carry
them
but
this
i
declined
and
now
with
a
secret
sigh
at
the
probability
that
i
might
never
see
them
again
i
left
their
house
and
hastened
towards
the
cottage
of
the
poor
woman
having
reached
it
i
made
the
hungry
inhabitants
happy
once
more
while
i
solaced
myself
with
some
tea
and
the
pleasing
reflection
that
i
had
brought
comfort
to
the
distressed
and
had
reclaimed
a
deluded
girl
from
ruin
and
infamy
adieu
letter
xxxvi
after
my
last
letter
i
spent
two
tedious
days
in
employments
that
i
now
blush
to
relate
no
less
than
doing
all
the
dirty
work
of
the
cottage
such
as
sweeping
the
room
kindling
the
fire
cooking
the
victuals
and
trying
by
dint
of
comb
and
soap
to
make
cherubs
of
the
children
what
bewitched
me
i
can
not
conceive
for
the
humanity
of
other
heroines
is
ever
clean
elegant
and
fit
for
the
reader
they
give
silver
and
tears
in
abundance
but
they
never
descend
to
the
bodily
charity
of
working
like
for
withered
old
women
and
brats
with
rosy
noses
i
can
only
say
in
vindication
of
myself
that
those
who
sheltered
me
were
poor
and
helpless
themselves
and
that
they
deserved
some
recompense
on
my
part
for
their
hospitality
to
me
so
you
must
not
condemn
me
totally
for
i
do
declare
to
you
that
i
would
much
rather
have
relieved
them
with
my
purse
and
soothed
them
with
my
sympathy
than
have
fried
their
herrings
and
washed
their
faces
at
the
same
time
take
notice
i
was
not
totally
forgetful
of
my
nobler
destiny
for
i
dedicated
part
of
this
period
to
the
composition
of
a
poem
which
i
reserve
for
my
memoirs
my
biographer
can
say
that
it
was
suggested
by
the
story
of
susan
and
even
if
it
should
still
appear
to
be
somewhat
forced
into
my
book
i
would
rather
have
this
the
case
than
suffer
posterity
to
go
without
it
altogether
here
it
is
caroline
beneath
a
thatch
where
gadding
woodbine
flower
about
the
lattice
and
the
porch
embower
an
aged
widow
lived
whose
calm
decline
clung
on
one
hope
her
lovely
caroline
her
lovely
caroline
in
virtue
blest
as
morning
snow
was
spotless
and
unprest
her
tresses
unadorn
a
braid
controll
her
pastoral
russet
knew
no
civic
gold
in
either
cheek
an
eddying
dimple
play
and
blushes
flitted
with
a
rosy
shade
her
airy
step
seem
lighting
from
the
sky
and
joy
and
frolic
sparkled
in
her
eye
yet
would
she
weep
at
sorrows
not
her
own
and
love
foredoom
her
heart
his
panting
throne
for
her
the
rustics
strove
a
homely
grace
clipped
their
redundant
locks
and
smooth
their
pace
lurk
near
her
custom
path
in
trimmest
guise
and
talk
the
simple
praises
of
her
eyes
but
fatal
hour
when
she
by
swains
unmov
beheld
the
master
of
the
vale
and
loved
long
had
he
tempted
her
reserve
in
vain
till
one
luxuriant
eve
that
sunn
the
plain
on
the
bent
herbage
where
a
gushing
brook
blue
harebells
and
the
tufted
violet
shook
where
hung
umbrageous
branches
overhead
and
the
rain
roses
lay
in
fragments
red
he
found
the
slumbering
maid
prophane
he
her
virgin
lip
then
first
by
man
carest
she
starts
and
like
a
ruddy
cloud
bestrewn
at
brake
of
morning
the
paly
moon
or
as
on
alpine
cliffs
a
wounded
doe
sheds
all
its
purple
life
upon
the
snow
so
the
maid
blushes
while
her
humble
eyes
fear
from
a
knot
of
primroses
to
rise
and
mute
she
sits
affecting
to
repair
the
discomposed
meanders
of
her
hair
need
i
his

the
accomplish
guile
that
glosses
poisonous
words
with
gilded
smile
the
tear
suborned
the
tongue
complete
to
please
eyes
ecstasied
idolatry
of
knees
these
and
his
oaths
i
pass
enough
to
tell
the
virgin
listen
and
believ
and
fell
and
now
from
home
maternal
long
she
dwells
with
him
midst
pleasures
unenjoy
till
the
sad
tidings
that
her
parent
dear
to
grief
had
died
a
victim
reach
her
ear
pale
with
despair

at

she
cries

me
close
these

the

now
bestow
ere
by

they
lay
me
low
then
without

or

she
hastes
her
journey
homeward
over
rocks
and
wastes
till
as
her
steps
a
hill
familiar

bursts
on
her
filling

claspt
are
her
hands
her
features
strewn
with

and
her
eyes
sparkle
with
a
keen
despair
but
as
she
turns
a
sudden
burst
of
tears
and
struggles
as
of
one
withheld
she
hears
she
conjures
yet
to
phrenzy

your

exclaims
with

no
never

come
for
the
cruel
village
shall
forgive
o
my

darling
come
and
unreproved
here
on
this
heart
rest
ever

here
on
this
constant
heart
while
thus
she
spoke
her
furious
sire
the
linkt
embraces
broke
borne
in
his
arms
she
wept
entreated
rav
then
fainted
as
a
mute
farewell
she
wav
but
now
the
wretch
with
low
and
wildered
cries
round
and
around
revolving
vacant
eyes
slow
from
the
green
departs
and
pauses
now
and
gnaws
her
tresses
and
contracts
her
brow
shock
by
the
change
the
matrons
stern
no
more
pursue
her
steps
and
her
return
implore
soon
a
poor
maniac
innocent
of
ill
she
wanders
unconfined
and
drinks
the
rill
and
plucks
the
simple
cress
a
hovel
near
her
native
vale
defends
her
from
the
year
with
tender
feet
to
flint
and
thistle
bare
and
faded
willows
weeping
in
her
hair
she
climbs
some
rock
at
morn
and
all
alone
chaunts
hasty
snatches
of
harmonious
moan
when
moons
empearl
the
leafy
locks
of
bowers
with
liquid
grain
and
light
the
glistening
flowers
she
gathers
honeysuckle
down
the
dells
and
tangled
eglantine
and
slumbering
bells
and
with
moist
finger
painted
by
the
leaves
a
coronet
of
roses
interweaves
then
steals
unheard
and
gliding
thro
the
yews
the
odorous
offering
on
her
mother
strews
at
morn
with
tender
pause
the
nymphs
admire
how
recent
chaplets
still
the
grave
attire
and
matrons
nightly
tell
how
fairies

one

some

hurrying
by

find
the

for
ever
flown
with
her

on

poor

her

willows

around

fallen
fallen
caroline
this
morning
having
resumed
my
muslins
i
repaired
to
my
castle
and
seated
on
the
stump
of
a
withered
oak
began
an
accurate
survey
of
its
strength
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
whether
it
could
stand
a
siege
in
case
lady
gwyn
should
attempt
to
dispossess
me
of
it
i
must
now
describe
it
to
you
it
is
situated
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
road
on
a
waste
tract
of
land
where
a
few
decayed
trunks
of
trees
are
all
that
remain
of
a
former
forest
the
castle
itself
which
i
fear
is
rather
too
small
for
long
corridors
and
suites
of
apartments
forms
a
square
with
a
turret
at
each
corner
and
with
a
large
gateway
now
stopped
up
with
stones
at
the
southern
side
while
i
surveyed
its
roofless
walls
with
briony
grass
and
nettles
and
admired
the
gothic
points
of
the
windows
where
mantling
ivy
had
supplied
the
place
of
glass
long
suffering
and
murder
came
to
my
thoughts
as
i
sat
planning
from
romances
the
revival
of
the
feudal
customs
and
manners
in
my
castle
and
of
the
feudal
system
among
my
tenantry
all
so
favourable
to
heroines
i
saw
a
magnificent
barouche
turning
from
the
road
into
the
common
and
advancing
towards
me
my
heart
beat
high
the
carriage
approached
stopt
and
who
should
alight
from
it
but
higginson
and
jerry
after
higginson
with
reverence
and
jerry
with
familiarity
had
congratulated
me
on
my
good
fortune
the
latter
looked
hard
at
the
castle
people
told
us
that
this
was
monkton
castle
said
he
where
is
the
monkton
castle
that
your
ladyship
is
to
live
in
it
is
my
friend
answered
i
there
cried
he
there
said
i
there
there
there
there
murder
murder
far
are
we
from
your
ladyship
house
said
the
postilion
advancing
with
his
hat
off
castle
is
my
house
answered
i
your
ladyship
pardon
said
he
i
mean
is
how
far
are
we
from
where
your
ladyship
lives
live
in
this
castle
answered
jerry
began
making
signs
to
me
over
the
fellow
shoulder
to
hold
my
tongue
are
you
grimacing
about
there
mr
sullivan
said
i
at
all
answered
he
a
way
i
have
got
but
your
ladyship
you
know
is
only
come
down
to
this
castle
on
a
sort
of
a
country
excursion
to
see
if
it
wants
repairing
you
know
you
mean
to
live
in
it
you
know
and
he
put
his
finger
on
his
nose
and
winked
at
me
i
know
i
do
mean
to
live
in
it
cried
i
so
i
request
you
will
cease
your
grinning
murder
murder
muttered
he
swinging
round
on
his
heel
the
postilion
now
stood
staring
at
the
venerable
edifice
with
an
expression
of
the
most
insolent
ridicule
what
are
looking
at
cried
jerry
the
sky
through
the
castle
window
said
the
fellow
reddening
and
shaking
with
smothered
laughter
then
mind
your
own
business
cried
jerry
that
is
to
take
the
horses
from
the
carriage
and
set
off
with
yourself
as
fast
as
you
can
till
i
am
paid
for
their
journey
down
said
the
postilion
will
your
ladyship
have
the
goodness
to
pay
me
said
i
pay
the
fellow
a
rap
have
i
answered
jerry
laid
out
my
last
farthing
in
little
things
for
your
ladyship
said
i
i
trouble
you
to
pay
him
irks
me
to
declare
answered
higginson
in
equipments
for
this
expedition
a
nice
little
desk
a
nice
little
comb
a
nice
little
a
nice
little
short
you
have
no
money
cried
i
a
farthing
answered
he
have
i
said
i
postilion
you
must
call
another
time
is
a
pretty
to
do
cried
the
postilion
this
is
a
shy
sort
of
a
business
not
even
the
price
of
a
feed
of
oats
snuff
my
eyes
i
must
have
the
money
i
must
blow
me
i
that
will
blow
you
cried
jerry
you
do
unloose
your
horses
this
moment
and
pack
off
the
postilion
took
them
from
the
carriage
in
silence
then
having
mounted
one
of
them
and
ridden
a
few
paces
from
us
he
stopped
you
set
of
vagabonds
and
swindlers
cried
he
a
roof
over
your
heads
or
a
penny
in
your
pockets
to
go
diddle
an
honest
man
out
of
his
day
labour
wait
till
master
takes
you
in
hand
and
if
i
do
tell
the
coachmaker
what
a
blockhead
he
was
to
give
you
his
barouche
on
tick
may
i
be
particularly
horsewhipt
ladyship
a
rummish
sort
of
a
tit
for
a
ladyship
and
that
is
my
lord
i
suppose
and
this
is
the
marquis
three
pickpockets
from
i
would
bet
a
whip
to
a
wisp
ladyship
oh
her
ladyship
and
away
he
cantered
ladyshipping
it
till
he
was
out
of
hearing
young
person
deserves
a
moral
lecture
said
higginson
deserves
a
confounded
drubbing
cried
jerry
now
your
conscience
does
your
ladyship
intend
to
live
in
this
old
castle
my
honour
i
do
replied
i
is
there
no
decent
house
on
the
estate
that
one
of
your
tenants
could
lend
you
said
he
you
must
know
replied
i
though
lady
gwyn
the
person
who
has
withheld
my
property
from
me
so
long
acknowledged
my
right
to
it
but
a
few
days
since
still
as
she
has
not
yet
yielded
up
the
title
deeds
in
consequence
of
a
quarrel
which
obliged
me
to
quit
her
house
it
is
improbable
that
the
tenantry
would
treat
me
as
their
mistress
all
i
can
do
is
to
seize
this
uninhabited
castle
which
lies
on
my
own
estate
but
i
can
tell
you
that
a
heroine
of
good
taste
and
who
wishes
to
rise
in
her
profession
would
infinitely
prefer
the
desolation
of
a
castle
to
the
comforts
of
a
villa
of
all
the
wise
freaks
cried
jerry
standing
astride
sticking
his
hands
in
his
ribs
and
nodding
his
head
as
he
looked
up
at
the
castle
tell
you
what
sullivan
interrupted
i
you
have
the
slightest
objection
to
remaining
here
you
are
at
perfect
liberty
to
depart
this
moment
do
you
think
i
would
leave
you
cried
he
then
oh
then
is
i
that
would
and
the
worse
your
quandary
the
more
i
would
stick
by
you
that
is
jerry
sullivan
and
if
it
was
a
gallows
itself
you
were
speculating
in
i
would
assist
you
all
the
same
one
can
find
friends
enough
when
one
is
in
the
right
but
give
me
the
fellow
that
would
fight
for
me
right
or
wrong
i
shook
his
honest
hand
with
warmth
and
then
asked
him
if
he
had
performed
my
commissions
ladyship
shall
hear
said
he
soon
as
i
got
your
letter
i
went
with
it
in
my
hand
and
shewed
it
at
fifty
different
shops
clothiers
and
glaziers
and
upholsterers
and
and
but
neither
old
tapestry
nor
old
painted
glass
nor
old
flags
stained
with
old
blood
nor
old
lutes
nor
old
any
thing
that
you
wanted
could
i
get
and
what
i
could
get
i
must
pay
for
and
so
what
i
must
pay
for
i
would
not
get
and
the
reason
why
i
had
no
money
and
moreover
as
sure
as
ever
i
shewed
them
your
letter
so
sure
they
laughed
at
it
at
it
cried
i
but
one
said
jerry
he
cried
i
going
to
knock
me
down
answered
jerry
as
i
did
not
wish
to
come
without
bringing
something
or
other
to
you
and
as
you
commanded
me
to
get
everything
old
egad
i
have
brought
three
whole
pieces
of
damaged
black
cloth
out
of
our
own
shop
that
i
thought
might
answer
for
the
hangings
and
curtains
and
i
bought
a
parcel
of
old
funeral
feathers
and
an
old
pall
from
an
undertaker
and
i
bought
an
old
harp
with
five
strings
that
will
do
any
thing
but
play
and
i
stole
our
own
parlour
bell
and
i
borrowed
a
horn
from
the
guard
of
a
which
i
hope
will
do
for
a
trumpet
and
now
here
they
are
all
in
the
barouche
and
my
bed
and
trunk
and
a
box
of
mr
higginson
the
barouche
said
i
did
you
get
that
not
shewing
your
letter
answered
jerry
besides
the
knew
me
and
i
told
him
it
was
for
my
lady
de
willoughby
as
beautiful
as
an
angel
but
he
did
not
mind
that
and
as
rich
as
a
jew
but
he
minded
that
and
so
he
gave
me
the
barouche
and
a
into
the
bargain
my
friend
said
i
did
your
best
so
as
soon
as
i
can
raise
a
sufficient
sum
i
will
furnish
my
castle
in
a
style
of
gothic
grandeur
which
your
modern
painters
and
glaziers
have
no
notion
of
meantime
if
you
and
higginson
will
pull
down
those
stones
that
choak
the
gateway
we
will
enter
the
building
and
see
what
can
be
done
with
our
present
materials
they
commenced
operations
with
such
alacrity
that
they
soon
cleared
away
the
rubbish
and
in
we
went
not
a
sign
of
a
roof
on
the
whole
edifice
the
venerable
verdure
of
damp
stained
the
walls
nettles
and
thistles
clothed
the
ground
and
three
of
the
turrets
inaccessible
to
human
feet
were
to
be
come
at
only
by
an
owl
or
an
angel
however
on
examining
the
fourth
or
eastern
turret
i
found
it
in
somewhat
better
condition
than
the
rest
a
ladder
leaning
against
an
aperture
in
the
ceiling
above
tempted
me
to
mount
and
i
got
into
a
room
of
about
eight
feet
square
the
breadth
of
the
turret
overrun
with
moss
and
groundsel
and
having
a
small
window
in
one
of
its
sides
from
the
floor
another
ladder
reached
to
another
aperture
in
the
ceiling
above
and
on
ascending
it
i
found
myself
at
the
top
of
the
tower
round
which
ran
a
broken
parapet
this
tower
therefore
i
determined
to
fit
up
and
inhabit
and
to
leave
the
other
three
in
a
state
of
classical
dilapidation
as
receptacles
for
strange
noises
horrid
sights
and
nocturnal
condottieri
i
then
descended
and
made
the
minstrel
and
warden
for
they
have
consented
to
undertake
these
offices
draw
the
barouche
within
the
gateway
and
convey
the
luggage
up
to
the
room
that
i
meant
for
my
residence
the
next
matter
that
we
set
about
was
hanging
the
chamber
with
the
black
cloth
and
this
we
contrived
to
do
by
means
of
wooden
pegs
which
the
warden
cut
with
his
knife
and
drove
with
a
stone
through
the
drapery
into
the
crevices
of
the
walls
we
found
two
of
the
three
pieces
of
black
cloth
sufficient
to
cover
the
sides
of
the
room
and
when
the
hangings
were
all
arranged
i
gazed
on
their
sombrous
and
antique
effect
with
the
most
heartfelt
transport
i
then
named
it
the
black
chamber
and
gave
orders
that
it
should
always
be
called
so
our
next
object
was
to
contrive
a
bed
for
me
jerry
therefore
procured
some
branches
of
trees
and
after
much
labour
and
with
no
small
ingenuity
constructed
a
bedstead
as
crazy
as
any
that
ever
creaked
under
a
heroine
we
then
hung
it
round
with
curtains
of
black
cloth
and
jerry
own
bed
being
placed
upon
it
we
spread
the
black
pall
over
that
never
was
there
a
more
funereal
piece
of
furniture
and
i
saw
with
pride
that
it
rivalled
the
famous
bed
in
the
mysteries
of
udolpho
the
minstrel
all
this
time
appeared
stupified
with
astonishment
but
worked
like
a
horse
puffing
and
panting
and
doing
every
thing
that
he
was
desired
without
uttering
a
word
dinner
now
became
our
consideration
and
i
have
just
dispatched
the
warden
like
peter
in
the
romance
of
the
forest
to
procure
provisions
not
a
farthing
has
he
to
purchase
any
since
even
the
which
susan
gave
me
is
already
exhausted
but
the
light
that
enters
at
my
window
begins
to
grow
grey
and
an
appropriate
gloom
thickens
through
the
chamber
the
minstrel
stands
in
a
corner
muttering
poetry
while
i
write
with
his
pen
and
ink
on
a
stool
that
the
warden
made
for
me
my
knees
are
my
desk
adieu
letter
xxxvii
just
at
the
close
of
evening
jerry
came
running
towards
the
castle
with
a
on
his
head
cried
he
putting
it
down
nicely
i
have
choused
a
little
there
was
she
tripping
along
as
tight
as
her
garter
for
your
life
cries
i
striding
up
to
her
is
the
big
bull
at
my
heels
that
has
just
killed
two
children
two
sucking
pigs
two
here
here
let
me
hold
your
pail
for
you
and
i
whips
it
off
her
head
so
what
does
she
do
but
she
runs
off
without
it
one
way
and
what
does
i
do
but
i
runs
off
with
it
another
way
and
besides
this
i
have
got
my
hat
filled
with
young
potatoes
and
my
pockets
stuffed
with
ears
of
wheat
and
if
we
ca
eat
a
hearty
dinner
off
these
dainties
why
that
our
next
may
be
fried
fleas
and
toasted
leather
though
i
was
angry
at
the
means
used
by
jerry
to
get
the
provisions
yet
as
dinner
just
then
had
more
charms
for
me
than
moral
sentiment
instead
of
instructing
him
in
the
lofty
doctrines
of
the
social
compact
i
bade
him
pound
the
grains
of
wheat
between
two
flat
stones
in
the
mean
time
i
sent
the
minstrel
to
the
cottage
for
a
light
and
some
fuel
and
on
his
return
made
him
stop
up
the
window
with
grass
and
fern
he
then
kindled
a
fire
of
wood
in
the
centre
of
the
black
chamber
for
as
the
floor
was
of
stone
it
ran
no
risk
of
being
burned
this
done
i
mixed
some
milk
with
the
bruised
wheat
kneaded
a
cake
and
laid
it
on
the
red
embers
while
jerry
took
charge
of
roasting
the
potatoes
as
soon
as
our
romantic
repast
was
ready
i
drew
my
stool
to
the
fire
my
household
sat
on
large
stones
and
we
made
a
tolerable
meal
they
on
the
potatoes
and
i
on
the
cake
which
hunger
had
really
rendered
palatable
the
warden
lifted
the
pail
to
my
lips
and
i
took
a
draught
of
the
rural
nectar
while
the
minstrel
remarked
that
nestor
himself
had
not
a
larger
goblet
i
now
paid
the
poor
cottagers
a
visit
and
carried
the
fragments
of
our
dinner
to
them
on
my
return
we
resumed
our
seats
and
hung
over
the
decayed
embers
that
cast
a
gloomy
glare
upon
the
bed
and
the
drapery
while
now
and
then
a
flash
from
the
ashes
as
they
sank
shot
a
reddened
light
on
the
paleness
of
the
minstrel
and
brightened
the
broad
features
of
the
warden
the
wind
had
risen
there
was
a
good
deal
of
excellent
howling
round
the
turret
we
sat
silent
and
looking
for
likenesses
in
the
fire
warden
cried
i
these
embers
with
a
fresh
splinter
and
let
me
hear
the
memoirs
of
your
life
the
warden
consented
the
fire
was
replenished
and
he
thus
began
upon
a
time
when
pigs
were
swine
will
trouble
you
for
a
more
respectable
beginning
said
i
striking
genteel
little
picture
to
bespeak
attention
such
as
all
was
dark
or
it
was
on
a
gloomy
night
in
the
month
of
november
would
be
the
devil
own
lie
cried
jerry
i
was
born
in
january
and
by
the
same
token
i
was
one
of
the
youngest
children
that
ever
was
born
for
i
saw
light
five
months
after
my
marriage
well
being
born
up
i
grew
and
the
first
word
i
said
was
mammy
and
my
hair
was
quite
yellow
at
first
though
is
so
brown
now
and
i
promised
to
be
handsome
but
the
symptom
soon
left
me
and
i
remember
i
was
as
proud
as
lucifer
when
i
got
trowsers
and
now
jerry
what
sort
of
trash
is
this
said
i
a
warden
like
you
i
hoped
to
have
heard
something
of
interest
and
adventure
from
you
that
your
family
was
respectable
though
poor
cried
jerry
i
am
of
the
who
were
kings
of
ireland
and
that
is
the
very
reason
i
have
not
mister
to
my
name
seeing
as
how
i
am
of
the
blood
royal
oh
if
is
the
wonderful
your
ladyship
wants
by
the
powers
i
am
at
home
thereabouts
well
i
was
iddicated
in
great
tenderness
and
ingenuity
and
when
i
came
of
age
i
went
and
seized
on
castle
and
fortified
it
and
got
a
crown
and
sceptre
and
reigned
in
great
peace
many
years
but
as
the
devil
would
have
it
said
i
must
insist
on
hearing
no
more
of
these
monstrous
untruths
cried
he
you
might
as
well
give
me
the
lie
at
once
o
murder
to
think
i
would
tell
a
falsehood
about
the
matter
said
i
a
falsehood
on
the
very
face
of
it
my
conscience
then
cried
he
as
like
your
own
story
as
one
pea
is
like
another
and
sure
i
did
not
contradict
you
whatever
i
might
think
and
i
have
my
thoughts
too
i
can
tell
you
when
you
talked
so
glib
of
your
great
estates
though
to
be
sure
your
ladyship
is
as
poor
as
a
rat
howsomever
since
you
will
have
it
so
is
all
a
falsehood
sure
enough
but
now
you
shall
hear
the
real
story
though
for
that
matter
any
body
can
tell
truth
and
no
thanks
to
them
then
my
father
was
nothing
more
than
a
common
labourer
and
just
poor
enough
to
be
honest
but
not
poor
enough
to
be
a
rogue
poverty
is
no
great
disgrace
provided
one
comes
honestly
by
it
for
one
may
get
poor
as
well
as
rich
by
knavery
so
being
poor
father
used
to
make
me
earn
odd
pennies
when
i
was
a
boy
and
at
last
i
got
so
smart
that
he
resolved
on
sending
me
to
sell
chickens
at
the
next
town
but
as
i
could
only
speak
irish
at
that
time
by
reason
we
lived
up
the
mountains
he
sat
down
and
taught
me
a
little
english
in
case
any
gentlefolks
should
ask
me
about
my
chickens
now
jerry
says
he
in
irish
if
any
gentleman
speaks
to
you
of
course
it
will
be
to
know
the
price
of
your
chickens
so
you
are
to
say
shillings
then
to
be
sure
he
will
be
for
lowering
the
price
so
you
are
to
say
stoutly
less
and
if
he
shakes
his
head
or
looks
angry
a
sign
he
wo
buy
unless
you
bate
a
little
so
you
are
to
say
believe
i
must
take
two
i
got
my
lesson
pat
and
off
i
set
with
my
hair
cut
and
my
face
washed
and
thinking
it
the
greatest
day
of
my
life
and
i
had
not
walked
a
hundred
yards
from
the
house
when
i
met
a
gentleman
how
far
is
it
to
the
next
village
says
he
shillings
sir
says
i
are
a
saucy
fellow
says
he
less
sir
says
i
will
give
you
a
box
in
the
face
says
he
believe
i
must
take
two
sir
says
i
instead
of
two
egad
i
got
six
and
as
many
kicks
as
would
match
and
home
i
ran
well
that
was
very
well
so
when
i
told
father
that
i
was
beaten
for
nothing
warrant
you
were
not
says
he
if
i
had
done
so
by
my
poor
father
he
would
have
broken
every
bone
in
my
skin
says
he
he
was
a
better
father
than
i
am
says
he
dare
you
say
that
your
father
was
better
than
my
father
says
i
and
upon
this
father
takes
me
by
the
ear
and
lugs
me
out
of
the
house
just
as
we
got
outside
the
same
gentleman
was
passing
by
and
he
stopped
and
began
to
complain
of
me
to
my
father
and
then
the
whole
matter
came
out
and
both
of
them
laughed
very
heartily
what
do
you
think
my
veracity
the
gentleman
took
me
home
with
him
to
clean
the
knives
and
boots
and
then
he
sent
me
to
school
where
i
learned
english
and
then
i
began
to
tend
at
table
and
at
last
became
a
regular
servant
in
the
family
here
i
lived
several
years
and
might
have
lived
till
now
but
that
one
night
when
mistress
had
company
while
bringing
in
the
tray
of
cake
and
wine
down
i
came
and
broke
all
the
glasses
this
and
that
says
mistress
only
to
be
sure
mistress
swear
are
quite
drunk
says
she
tasted
a
drop
all
day
says
i
and
it
was
true
for
me
i
did
not
begin
till
evening
taught
you
to
tell
falsehoods
says
she
you
did
says
i
you
taught
me
to
tell
visitors
you
were
not
at
home
when
all
the
time
you
are
peeping
down
the
bannisters
fine
fashions
indeed
nobody
is
ever
at
home
but
a
snail
says
i
and
i
would
have
said
more
too
but
that
master
kicked
me
out
of
the
house
that
was
very
well
and
now
my
misfortunes
were
all
before
me
like
a
wheelbarrow
happened
in
the
year
of
the
rebellion
so
being
out
of
service
i
lived
at
alehouses
and
there
it
was
that
i
met
gentlemen
with
rusty
superfine
on
their
backs
and
with
the
longest
words
in
the
world
they
soon
persuaded
me
that
old
ireland
was
going
to
ruin
i
forget
how
now
but
i
know
i
had
the
whole
story
pat
at
that
time
and
the
end
of
it
was
that
i
became
an
united
irishman
though
i
would
have
died
for
my
country
it
would
be
carrying
the
joke
too
far
to
starve
for
her
and
i
had
now
spent
all
my
wages
so
at
last
back
i
went
to
my
old
master
and
fell
on
my
knees
and
begged
his
pardon
for
my
bad
conduct
when
i
lived
with
him
and
prayed
of
him
to
take
me
once
more
well
he
did
and
it
was
only
two
nights
after
that
we
heard
a
great
noise
outside
and
master
comes
running
into
the
kitchen
says
he
are
the
rebels
breaking
into
the
house
and
as
i
know
you
are
a
faithful
fellow
take
this
sword
and
pistol
and
stand
by
me
but
i
will
stand
before
you
says
i
so
we
mustered
our
men
five
in
all
and
posted
ourselves
on
the
head
of
the
stairs
when
in
burst
the
rebels
into
the
hall
and
we
began
a
parley
then
is
that
barney
delany
says
i
to
their
captain
then
is
that
jerry
sullivan
says
he
to
me
are
one
of
us
says
he
now
turn
round
and
shoot
your
master
says
he
will
cut
off
both
my
hands
first
says
i
that
then
says
he
and
he
fires
a
shot
and
i
another
and
to
it
we
kept
till
we
beat
them
all
off
in
a
few
months
afterwards
this
same
barney
being
made
prisoner
i
was
bound
over
as
witness
against
him
so
some
of
the
gentlemen
with
the
long
words
came
to
me
and
told
me
how
wrong
i
had
acted
in
fighting
for
my
master
instead
of
for
my
country
and
that
i
must
make
amends
by
giving
evidence
in
barney
favour
they
puzzled
me
so
that
from
then
till
now
i
never
could
make
out
whether
i
was
right
or
wrong
in
standing
by
master
but
somehow
i
think
i
was
right
for
though
patriotism
as
the
gentlemen
call
it
is
a
fine
thing
yet
after
all
there
is
nothing
like
gratitude
why
if
the
devil
himself
did
me
a
kind
office
i
believe
i
would
make
shift
to
do
him
another
and
not
act
like
the
clergy
who
spend
their
whole
lives
in
snubbing
at
him
and
calling
him
all
manner
of
names
though
they
know
that
but
for
him
there
would
not
be
a
clergyman
or
a
fat
living
in
the
kingdom
i
was
persuaded
to
do
the
genteel
thing
by
barney
delany
so
when
the
day
for
the
trial
came
i
drank
myself
pretty
unintelligible
and
i
swore
point
blank
before
judge
and
jury
that
i
did
not
know
barney
good
or
bad
and
that
all
i
knew
of
him
was
good
and
i
bothered
the
lawyers
and
they
turned
me
from
the
table
and
threatened
to
indite
me
for
perjury
but
it
was
the
people
that
did
praise
me
and
call
it
iligant
swearing
mighty
pretty
evidence
and
i
was
the
great
man
of
the
day
and
they
took
me
to
the
fair
that
was
hard
by
where
we
tippled
a
little
more
and
then
we
sallied
forth
ripe
for
fun
as
we
were
running
through
the
fair
what
should
i
see
but
a
man
bald
head
sticking
out
of
a
hole
in
one
of
the
tents
to
cool
i
suppose
so
i
just
lifted
up
my
cudgel
and
just
laid
it
down
again
when
in
a
moment
out
came
a
whole
set
of
fellows
from
the
tent
and
the
man
asks
which
of
us
had
broken
his
head
was
myself
says
i
curse
me
if
i
could
help
it
that
skull
of
your
looked
so
inviting
both
parties
began
a
battle
and
then
others
who
had
nothing
better
to
do
came
and
joined
they
did
not
know
why
but
no
matter
for
that
any
one
may
fight
when
there
is
an
occasion
but
the
beauty
of
it
is
to
fight
when
there
is
no
occasion
at
all
in
the
midst
of
it
up
came
the
military
to
spoil
sport
as
usual
and
they
dispersed
us
and
made
some
of
us
prisoners
i
among
the
rest
and
we
were
put
into
bridewell
well
that
was
very
well
so
at
night
we
contrived
to
break
it
open
beat
the
keepers
and
make
our
escape
then
what
to
do
with
myself
was
the
question
it
would
go
hard
with
me
if
i
were
caught
again
so
i
skulked
about
the
country
several
days
till
happening
to
meet
some
lads
going
beyond
seas
to
reap
the
english
harvest
they
persuaded
me
to
buy
a
and
go
with
them
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
such
a
hurricane
as
we
had
at
sea
and
such
tumbling
and
tossing
and
then
we
were
driven
to
the
world
end
or
the
land
end
or
some
end
but
i
know
i
thought
i
was
come
to
my
own
end
in
short
such
wonderful
adventures
never
were
known
adventures
my
friend
cried
i
love
to
hear
wonderful
adventures
said
he
had
an
adventure
every
moment
for
every
moment
we
were
near
going
to
the
bottom
was
that
all
cried
i
said
he
was
such
pulling
of
ropes
and
reefing
and
rigging
and
we
went
over
so
many
seas
and
channels
the
irish
channel
and
the
british
channel
and
the
bristol
channel
and
the
baltic
sea
and
the
atlantic
sea
and
oh
dear
as
good
as
forty
more
more
cried
i
pray
what
were
their
names
luck
to
me
if
i
can
remember
said
he
you
were
in
the
red
sea
said
i
be
sure
i
was
in
the
black
sea
doubt
of
it
in
the
white
sea
and
the
pacific
ocean
every
mother
soul
of
them
pray
what
kind
of
seas
are
they
asked
i
said
he
red
sea
is
as
red
as
blood
and
the
black
sea
is
as
black
as
ink
and
the
white
sea
is
the
colour
of
new
milk
or
nearer
and
the
what
that
word
said
i
what
is
the
meaning
of
pacific
said
he
means
peaceful
or
calm
answered
i
i
thought
so
said
he
the
devil
a
wave
that
same
ocean
had
on
it
high
or
low
my
conscience
it
was
as
smooth
as
the
palm
of
my
hand
care
jerry
said
i
laughing
am
afraid
then
cried
he
i
may
never
said
i
swearing
dad
cried
he
had
better
tell
my
story
yourself
for
you
seem
resolved
to
have
it
all
your
own
way
may
be
you
wo
believe
me
neither
when
i
tell
you
that
i
landed
you
are
not
at
sea
now
said
i
will
believe
you
then
said
he
suppose
you
will
believe
that
i
made
a
little
money
by
reaping
and
then
trudged
to
london
to
try
my
fortune
make
no
doubt
of
the
fact
said
i
pray
how
did
you
contrive
to
subsist
in
london
at
first
spitting
through
my
teeth
said
jerry
care
cried
i
i
suspect
is
another
you
mean
lie
said
he
have
caught
you
at
last
for
is
as
true
as
true
can
be
and
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
you
must
know
that
is
now
the
fashion
for
gentlemen
to
be
their
own
coachmen
and
not
only
to
drive
like
coachmen
but
to
talk
walk
dress
drink
swear
and
even
spit
like
coachmen
well
two
days
after
my
arrival
in
london
as
i
was
standing
in
the
street
and
looking
about
i
happened
to
spit
through
my
teeth
to
the
envy
and
admiration
of
a
gentleman
that
was
just
driving
his
own
carriage
by
me
for
he
stopped
and
called
me
to
him
and
swore
i
should
get
if
i
would
teach
him
to
a
that
was
the
word
so
when
he
gave
me
plain
english
for
it
i
closed
with
him
and
went
to
his
house
and
taught
him
to
spit
so
well
that
my
fame
spread
through
the
town
and
all
the
fashionable
bloods
came
to
me
for
instruction
till
at
last
i
had
a
good
mind
to
set
up
a
spitting
academy
i
had
now
spit
myself
into
such
affluence
that
i
refused
a
coachman
seat
with
forty
pounds
a
year
for
as
i
said
even
a
curate
had
more
than
that
and
may
be
instead
of
a
seat
on
the
box
i
might
at
last
have
risen
to
a
seat
in
the
parliament
for
many
a
man
has
got
there
by
dirtier
tricks
than
mine
but
that
my
profession
which
was
of
a
nature
to
dry
up
my
mouth
forced
me
to
frequent
porterhouses
where
as
the
devil
would
have
it
i
met
other
gentlemen
such
as
i
had
met
before
and
with
just
the
same
set
of
long
words
a
short
time
all
of
us
agreed
that
our
country
was
ruined
and
that
something
must
be
done
so
we
made
ourselves
into
a
club
for
the
purpose
of
writing
ballads
about
the
war
and
the
taxes
and
a
thousand
lashes
that
a
soldier
got
and
we
used
to
set
ten
or
twelve
round
a
table
in
our
each
with
her
pint
of
beer
and
one
of
our
club
would
teach
them
the
tune
with
a
little
kit
while
i
was
in
a
overhead
composing
the
words
and
they
reckoned
me
the
best
poet
of
them
all
and
they
told
me
that
my
writings
would
descend
to
posterity
and
sometimes
the
thoughts
came
so
quick
on
me
that
i
was
obliged
to
chalk
them
down
on
the
back
of
the
bellows
but
whenever
i
wanted
an
idea
i
read
the
weekly
register
and
then
between
the
register
and
the
liquor
i
got
worked
up
to
such
a
pitch
of
poetry
that
my
blood
used
to
run
cold
in
the
morning
at
the
thoughts
of
what
i
would
have
done
at
night
one
evening
the
were
round
the
table
sipping
and
singing
to
the
little
kit
and
i
had
just
popt
down
my
head
through
the
of
the
to
ask
the
chairman
the
rhime
for
you
says
he
i
tell
you
twenty
times
is
when
in
bursts
the
door
and
a
parcel
of
seize
him
and
the
whole
set
for
holding
seditious
meetings
and
publishing
inflammatory
songs
think
of
that
when
i
protest
to
you
our
only
object
was
by
causing
disunion
and
convincing
our
enemies
that
we
could
not
carry
on
the
war
to
procure
a
speedy
and
honorable
peace
i
got
out
of
the
scrape
by
being
concealed
in
the
and
i
remember
well
it
was
on
that
very
night
i
first
saw
my
wife
said
i
me
the
particulars
of
that
event
the
first
meeting
of
lovers
is
always
so
interesting
said
he
home
sorrowful
enough
after
the
ruin
of
our
club
i
resolved
to
drown
care
in
a
noggin
and
accordingly
turned
into
a
where
i
found
three
from
covent
garden
bound
on
the
same
errand
dram
shall
we
drink
says
they
says
one
says
another
says
another
and
so
they
fell
to
and
drank
am
happy
that
i
ever
came
to
this
city
of
lunnun
for
my
fortune
is
made
says
brandy
my
father
had
lived
i
would
be
brought
up
to
good
iddication
says
gin
my
mother
had
lived
i
would
be
brought
up
at
a
says
curse
you
says
gin
was
your
mother
but
an
old
curse
you
says
was
your
father
but
a
of
a
then
they
fell
a
fighting
and
scratching
and
the
present
jerry
sullivan
was
getting
well
cuffed
when
i
came
to
her
assistance
so
that
was
our
first
meeting
may
boast
of
it
said
i
then
for
your
courtship
shall
hear
said
he
was
so
much
obliged
to
me
that
she
asked
me
home
to
tea
and
i
went
i
found
her
a
buxom
widow
and
at
that
time
she
was
as
fine
a
doorful
as
tight
a
wench
over
a
as
you
would
wish
to
see
and
there
was
her
daughter
and
a
great
deal
of
good
company
the
tailor
wife
and
the
wife
and
the
pawnbroker
wife
and
none
so
grand
as
they
and
they
told
as
many
lies
over
the
first
dish
of
tea
as
a
parcel
of
porters
would
over
twenty
barrels
of
strong
beer
and
a
young
valet
who
i
could
see
was
courting
the
widow
swore
that
it
was
as
good
to
be
out
of
the
world
as
out
of
the
fashion
and
then
he
whispered
to
her
that
she
looked
killing
genteel
but
i
only
pinched
her
elbow
and
i
thought
she
liked
that
better
was
very
vulgar
however
observed
i
first
process
is
to
kiss
the
hand
cried
jerry
is
a
slobbering
trick
to
be
mumbling
knuckles
just
as
a
pup
niggles
at
a
bone
i
am
the
man
to
take
at
once
and
fluster
a
woman
and
reckon
her
ribs
for
her
no
creeping
up
and
up
and
up
and
then
down
and
down
and
down
for
me
why
as
i
hope
to
be
saved
i
gave
that
same
widow
a
thundering
kiss
on
three
days
acquaintance
thing
exclaimed
i
and
what
did
she
say
why
she
said
be
quiet
now
though
i
know
you
ca
so
of
course
i
kissed
her
still
more
while
she
changed
colour
in
a
minute
as
often
as
a
blackberry
in
a
month
ha
done
do
says
she
or
i
will
call
out
only
there
is
nobody
at
home
when
at
the
moment
in
pops
the
valet
and
catches
us
lip
to
lip
he
was
a
conceited
sort
of
a
chap
who
used
to
set
himself
off
with
great
airs
shew
his
white
hands
that
i
verily
believe
he
washed
every
day
of
his
life
curse
and
swear
just
like
a
gentleman
keep
a
and
make
both
his
heels
meet
when
he
bowed
i
had
nothing
upon
earth
to
oppose
to
all
this
but
a
bit
of
a
quarrel
that
was
strong
point
and
sure
enough
i
gave
him
such
a
beating
for
catching
us
that
the
widow
thought
me
main
stout
and
married
me
in
a
week
her
money
i
set
up
shop
and
i
did
not
much
mind
her
being
ten
years
older
than
myself
since
she
was
ten
times
richer
i
only
copied
my
own
father
there
for
he
once
happened
to
be
divided
between
two
girls
one
of
them
with
a
single
cow
for
her
portion
and
the
other
with
two
cows
so
he
consulted
his
landlord
which
of
them
he
should
marry
and
his
landlord
bade
him
by
all
means
marry
the
girl
with
the
two
cows
for
says
he
there
is
not
a
cow
difference
between
any
two
women
now
that
is
my
history
i
am
to
collect
from
it
said
i
character
of
your
countrymen
in
your
own
class
of
life
i
must
conclude
that
they
are
frank
generous
and
noble
but
neglected
in
their
morals
and
education
and
oppressed
by
their
superiors
there
is
the
matter
said
jerry
way
of
keeping
us
quiet
they
keep
us
down
now
that
is
just
the
way
to
prevent
our
keeping
quiet
for
it
is
natural
that
men
who
are
kept
down
should
try
to
rise
up
why
do
they
keep
you
down
asked
i
answered
he
are
of
one
religion
and
they
of
another
and
they
say
our
religion
is
so
bad
that
it
would
make
us
keep
them
down
if
they
did
not
keep
us
down
said
i
ought
to
be
greatly
obliged
to
them
for
keeping
you
down
because
that
is
doing
what
they
condemn
lest
you
should
do
it
now
it
is
the
highest
possible
test
of
to
become
criminal
ourselves
in
order
to
keep
our
friends
virtuous
wise
legislator
said
the
minstrel
not
to
forget
the
eighteenth
century
in
his
retrospection
to
the
sixteenth
nor
in
his
anticipation
of
the
twentieth
know
nothing
of
anticskippation
said
jerry
i
will
tell
you
a
bit
of
a
story
when
i
first
went
to
london
and
was
poor
i
used
to
dine
in
a
cellar
with
other
irishmen
where
the
knives
and
forks
were
chained
to
the
table
for
fear
we
should
steal
them
though
in
my
mind
the
surest
way
to
make
a
rogue
is
to
let
him
know
that
you
think
him
one
well
when
we
began
to
grow
rich
we
got
a
spirit
and
broke
the
chains
and
paid
for
them
and
broke
them
again
and
paid
for
them
again
and
so
on
at
last
the
master
began
to
see
that
the
same
spirit
which
made
us
break
the
chains
would
prevent
us
from
stealing
the
knives
and
forks
so
he
took
off
the
chains
and
then
his
table
was
no
disgrace
and
we
brought
more
company
to
it
and
he
made
his
fortune
the
minstrel
and
warden
now
retired
to
their
allotted
place
of
rest
the
barouche
each
was
to
keep
watch
in
turn
at
the
castle
gate
and
to
toll
the
hour
on
the
bell
the
wind
still
moaned
round
the
turret
and
now
the
fire
ghastly
in
decay
but
just
tinged
the
projecting
folds
of
the
hangings
dismal
looked
the
bed
as
i
drew
near
and
while
i
lifted
the
velvet
pall
to
creep
beneath
i
shivered
and
almost
expected
to
behold
the
apparition
of
a
human
face
starting
from
under
it
when
i
lay
down
i
kept
my
eyes
quite
closed
for
fear
of
seeing
something
nor
was
it
till
the
third
bell
had
tolled
that
i
fell
asleep
adieu
letter
xxxviii
i
rose
early
this
morning
and
summoned
jerry
to
the
black
chamber
for
my
head
was
teeming
with
the
most
important
projects
friend
said
i
lady
gwyn
has
already
acknowledged
me
as
the
rightful
owner
not
alone
of
this
castle
but
of
the
house
that
she
herself
inhabits
yet
i
can
not
apply
to
my
tenantry
for
rent
or
even
raise
a
sum
of
money
sufficient
to
purchase
my
breakfast
till
she
surrenders
up
those
deeds
and
parchments
which
would
give
me
a
legal
claim
now
as
i
fear
i
shall
find
it
a
hard
matter
to
make
her
do
so
i
have
resolved
on
proposing
a
compromise
and
on
waving
all
title
to
the
house
and
demesne
that
she
now
occupies
provided
she
will
consent
to
put
me
in
formal
possession
of
this
castle
and
all
the
land
appertaining
to
it
have
therefore
determined
to
pay
her
ladyship
a
visit
for
this
purpose
but
as
i
was
driven
from
her
house
with
disgrace
once
before
i
mean
to
return
thither
now
with
such
a
train
of
domestics
as
shall
put
it
out
of
her
power
to
offer
me
insult
or
detain
my
person
warden
if
i
could
but
hire
a
set
of
servants
who
would
consent
to
live
in
my
castle
and
defend
it
i
would
on
my
part
give
each
of
them
a
lot
of
ground
and
consider
them
as
feudal
vassals
and
they
could
accompany
me
to
lady
gwyn
i
have
therefore
to
request
that
you
will
instantly
set
off
and
endeavour
to
procure
them
for
me
as
no
time
is
to
be
lost
your
ladyship
pardon
said
jerry
are
sending
me
of
a
fool
errand
for
who
but
madmen
would
hire
as
servants
in
such
a
castle
as
this
would
you
have
them
build
swallows
nests
for
themselves
under
the
windows
and
live
on
suction
like
the
snipes
sullivan
said
i
no
sarcasms
but
go
and
do
as
you
are
desired
from
this
moment
out
i
say
nothing
cried
jerry
at
all
at
all
but
like
the
old
woman
crow
i
will
be
the
devil
for
thinking
sarcasm
said
i
be
is
better
for
me
to
go
at
once
before
i
get
into
a
scrape
cried
he
now
your
ladyship
how
many
of
these
same
feudal
vessels
as
you
call
these
vessels
that
are
to
have
no
drink
well
give
me
my
directions
quick
and
there
is
my
hand
on
my
mouth
till
i
am
out
of
the
castle
may
hire
about
fifteen
or
twenty
of
them
said
i
remember
i
will
have
no
dapper
footmen
with
smirking
faces
i
must
have
a
clan
such
as
we
read
of
in
the
middle
ages
fellows
with
norman
noses
and
all
sorts
of
frowns
men
of
iron
fit
to
live
in
comets
live
in
comets
than
but
he
clapped
his
hand
on
his
mouth
in
time
and
then
ran
down
the
steps
during
his
absence
i
paid
a
visit
to
the
poor
cottagers
and
after
having
sat
with
them
awhile
and
promised
them
assistance
before
evening
i
returned
towards
the
castle
on
approaching
it
i
perceived
to
my
great
surprise
jerry
also
advancing
at
the
head
of
about
twenty
strange
looking
men
all
armed
with
bludgeons
are
the
boys
cried
jerry
are
the
true
sort
few
norman
noses
i
believe
but
all
honest
hearts
and
though
they
never
lived
in
comets
egad
they
lived
in
ireland
and
that
is
worth
fifty
comets
look
at
hold
up
your
heads
you
dogs
they
came
over
only
to
save
the
hay
and
reap
the
harvest
but
when
they
found
their
countryman
and
a
woman
in
distress
they
volunteered
their
services
and
now
here
they
are
ready
for
that
same
lady
gwyn
or
any
lady
in
the
land
my
friends
said
i
be
well
assured
that
i
will
reward
you
munificently
cheers
cried
jerry
they
gave
three
cheers
my
heart
dilated
with
exultation
at
beholding
this
assemblage
of
feudal
vassals
at
my
command
and
in
a
moment
i
had
arranged
my
project
as
it
was
expedient
to
inspire
lady
gwyn
with
respect
and
awe
i
resolved
on
making
the
best
possible
display
of
my
power
taste
and
feudal
magnificence
of
course
i
meant
to
visit
her
in
my
barouche
and
since
i
had
no
horses
for
it
my
plan
was
to
make
some
of
my
domestics
draw
it
in
a
triumphal
manner
while
the
rest
should
follow
in
procession
to
let
them
escort
me
in
their
own
ragged
and
unclassical
dresses
was
impossible
but
i
think
you
will
give
me
credit
for
my
ingenuity
in
supplying
them
with
others
i
determined
to
divide
the
black
cloth
into
large
pieces
which
they
should
wear
as
cloaks
and
to
stick
a
black
feather
in
each
of
their
hats
a
costume
that
would
give
them
the
pleasing
appearance
of
udolphian
condottieri
we
now
set
about
making
the
cloaks
but
as
we
had
not
sufficient
cloth
remaining
we
were
obliged
to
strip
the
black
chamber
of
part
of
its
hangings
i
had
appropriated
a
large
portion
of
the
cloth
to
make
flowing
drapery
for
higginson
whom
i
meant
to
take
in
the
barouche
with
me
but
as
minstrels
never
wear
hats
and
have
always
bald
heads
i
was
at
a
loss
how
to
manage
about
his
since
he
still
cherished
and
curled
his
locks
with
a
spruceness
most
unmeet
for
minstrelsy
at
last
after
repeated
assurances
how
much
better
he
would
look
i
persuaded
him
to
let
jerry
shave
the
crown
of
his
head
accordingly
jerry
performed
the
tonsoral
operation
in
the
black
chamber
while
i
remained
below
fixing
the
feathers
and
cloaks
on
my
domestics
these
poor
fellows
who
i
suppose
had
never
read
even
an
alphabet
much
less
a
romance
in
their
lives
stood
gaping
at
each
other
in
silent
wonder
though
some
of
them
attempted
unmeaning
and
i
must
say
troublesome
jests
on
what
was
going
forward
when
drest
a
more
formidable
and
picturesque
group
than
they
presented
you
never
beheld
and
while
i
was
still
admiring
them
forth
from
the
turret
issued
the
minstrel
but
such
a
spectacle
half
his
huge
head
was
shorn
of
its
hair
his
black
garments
knotted
just
under
his
bare
neck
gave
a
new
ghastliness
to
his
face
while
his
eyes
as
he
rivetted
them
upon
me
were
starting
out
of
their
sockets
with
anxiety
and
agitation
he
looked
preternatural
to
contain
was
impossible
i
began
laughing
and
the
irishman
uttered
a
shout
of
derision
the
poor
man
looked
round
him
turned
as
pale
as
ashes
his
face
began
to
work
and
quiver
and
at
last
he
burst
into
a
piteous
fit
of
crying
then
suddenly
lifting
a
prodigious
stone
he
whirled
it
at
head
who
ducked
for
his
life
and
saved
it
what
did
i
do
to
you
cried
jerry
shaved
my
head
because
you
knew
it
would
spoil
my
looks
cried
the
minstrel
you
are
endeavouring
to
outdo
me
with
my
mistress
and
she
likes
you
better
than
me
but
it
can
not
be
holpen
oh
dear
dear
i
tried
to
sooth
him
nothing
would
do
nor
could
i
persuade
him
to
accompany
me
so
now
all
being
ready
i
posted
two
sentinels
on
the
top
of
the
turret
and
then
got
into
my
barouche
six
vassals
were
deputed
to
draw
it
the
rest
followed
with
their
oaken
saplings
under
their
cloaks
and
jerry
headed
the
whole
never
was
a
more
august
procession
and
i
will
venture
to
say
that
this
country
at
least
never
saw
any
thing
like
it
as
we
proceeded
along
the
road
the
people
ran
out
of
their
houses
to
gaze
on
us
some
said
that
we
were
strolling
players
and
others
swore
that
we
were
going
to
a
funeral
while
a
rabble
of
boys
and
girls
capered
at
our
heels
and
gathered
as
we
went
it
was
not
till
about
five
that
we
reached
lady
gwyn
avenue
we
paused
there
a
moment
while
i
made
my
attendants
shake
the
dust
from
their
cloaks
and
wipe
the
barouche
and
now
with
a
beating
heart
i
found
myself
at
her
door
jerry
then
pealed
an
authoritative
rap
the
door
opened
the
servant
stared
the
lady
gwyn
said
i
her
niece
the
lady
cherubina
de
willoughby
desires
the
honour
of
a
conference
with
her
the
fellow
grinned
and
vanished
and
in
a
few
minutes
out
came
her
ladyship
accompanied
by
several
guests
some
of
whose
faces
i
remembered
having
seen
there
before
i
therefore
felt
doubly
delighted
that
i
had
come
in
such
feudal
and
chivalric
pomp
they
greeted
me
with
great
kindness
and
respect
carelessly
bowing
to
lady
gwyn
as
i
sat
half
reclined
in
the
barouche
i
thus
addressed
her
now
come
to
your
ladyship
with
a
proposal
which
it
is
as
generous
in
me
to
offer
as
it
will
be
politic
in
you
to
accept
and
first
learn
that
i
am
at
this
moment
in
actual
possession
of
monkton
castle
the
noble
seat
of
my
ancestors
to
that
castle
and
to
this
house
your
ladyship
has
already
acknowledged
my
just
right
and
to
both
of
course
i
can
establish
my
claim
by
a
judiciary
process
however
i
prefer
a
more
amicable
mode
of
adjustment
and
am
willing
to
spare
the
effusion
of
money
i
now
declare
my
readiness
to
make
over
this
house
and
demesne
to
your
ladyship
and
to
your
heirs
for
ever
on
condition
that
you
on
your
part
will
surrender
to
me
without
delay
or
reservation
the
title
deeds
of
monkton
castle
and
all
the
monkton
estate
this
is
a
generous
proposal
what
say
you
yes
or
no
cherubina
returned
her
ladyship
can
not
think
of
entering
into
terms
with
you
till
you
restore
the
portrait
that
you
purloined
from
this
house
but
in
the
mean
time
as
a
proof
of
my
desire
to
settle
matters
amicably
i
request
the
honour
of
your
company
at
dinner
ladyship
must
excuse
me
said
i
with
a
noble
air
our
present
dispute
respecting
this
house
i
should
deem
it
derogatory
to
my
honour
and
my
dignity
were
i
to
enter
it
in
the
capacity
of
guest
then
death
and
cried
jerry
it
to
refuse
so
good
an
offer
after
starving
all
the
morning
cried
lady
gwyn
have
not
put
a
morsel
inside
our
mouths
this
blessed
day
said
jerry
even
yesterday
we
dined
on
potatoes
and
milk
and
a
sort
of
a
contrivance
of
a
cake
that
your
ladyship
throw
to
your
cat
i
thought
i
should
drop
at
this
exposure
of
our
poverty
and
i
commanded
him
to
be
silent
enough
for
silence
when
one
has
spoken
cried
he
sure
it
vex
a
saint
to
hear
you
talking
about
honour
and
dignity
when
all
the
time
you
are
in
a
starving
state
remarked
said
lady
gwyn
pray
my
good
fellow
who
are
you
warden
answered
i
quickly
lest
he
should
speak
these
are
my
feudal
vassals
and
i
have
left
my
minstrel
and
the
rest
of
my
faithful
people
on
the
battlements
of
the
eastern
tower
just
over
the
black
chamber
to
guard
my
castle
for
all
this
fine
talk
cried
jerry
have
not
so
much
as
a
rap
farthing
amongst
the
whole
set
of
us
so
pray
your
ladyship
do
make
her
stay
dinner
do
or
may
be
said
he
getting
closer
and
whispering
lady
gwyn
be
you
would
just
lend
her
or
so
and
my
soul
i
will
pay
you
myself
in
ten
days
traitor
cried
i
rising
in
the
barouche
and
dignifying
my
manner
do
not
want
a
dinner
i
would
not
accept
of
a
dinner
but
above
all
of
a
dinner
in
this
house
till
i
am
mistress
of
it
is
it
true
cried
jerry
to
lady
gwyn
she
is
the
real
mistress
of
this
house
certainly
certainly
said
her
ladyship
certainly
certainly
said
the
guests
bad
luck
to
me
if
ever
i
believed
it
till
this
moment
cried
jerry
why
then
wo
your
ladyship
give
it
up
to
her
answered
she
quiet
surrender
of
an
estate
was
never
yet
read
of
in
romances
the
only
rational
excuse
you
can
assign
said
i
is
on
the
table
said
the
butler
coming
to
the
door
so
cried
jerry
to
me
wo
dine
in
this
house
till
you
are
mistress
of
it
as
i
hope
to
see
heaven
answered
i
so
cried
he
to
lady
gwyn
wo
make
her
mistress
of
it
as
i
hope
to
see
heaven
answered
she
then
cried
jerry
one
refuses
to
dine
in
it
till
she
is
mistress
of
it
and
since
the
other
owns
that
she
ought
to
be
mistress
of
it
and
yet
wo
make
her
mistress
of
it
by
the
powers
i
will
make
her
mistress
of
it
in
two
minutes
so
saying
he
shouted
some
words
in
an
uncouth
jargon
irish
i
suppose
to
my
vassals
several
of
whom
instantly
darted
into
the
house
others
brandished
their
sticks
in
the
faces
of
the
guests
jerry
himself
ran
lifted
me
from
the
barouche
and
bore
me
into
the
hall
while
the
rest
brought
up
the
rear
and
beat
back
the
gentlemen
who
were
attempting
to
rush
between
us
and
the
door
jerry
set
me
down
in
the
hall
where
i
stood
motionless
while
some
of
my
domestics
scudded
with
merry
uproar
through
kitchen
parlour
garret
and
drove
footman
maid
valet
cook
scullion
and
all
out
of
the
house
then
cried
jerry
shutting
the
ladyship
is
in
quiet
possession
for
ever
and
ever
said
i
is
no
knowing
how
this
will
end
but
come
into
that
parlour
for
some
of
my
people
are
making
a
sad
riot
there
in
we
went
it
was
the
and
to
my
great
astonishment
i
found
about
a
dozen
of
my
domestics
already
round
the
table
eating
and
drinking
as
if
nothing
had
happened
in
vain
jerry
and
i
desired
them
to
desist
they
did
not
even
seem
to
hear
us
they
laughed
and
capered
and
tore
whole
joints
with
their
hands
and
swallowed
the
richest
wines
from
the
decanters
the
rest
soon
flocked
in
and
then
such
a
scene
of
confusion
arose
as
struck
me
with
utter
dismay
and
now
having
glutted
themselves
they
ran
to
the
windows
and
exhibited
the
mangled
meat
and
diminished
wine
to
the
dismayed
eyes
of
poor
lady
gwyn
there
she
stood
in
the
midst
of
her
friends
looking
like
a
bedlamite
and
as
soon
as
i
appeared
she
beckoned
me
with
the
most
frantic
gesticulations
to
open
the
window
i
called
the
warden
to
my
side
and
flung
up
the
sash
us
in
let
us
in
cried
she
house
will
be
destroyed
by
these
diabolical
miscreants
oh
let
us
in
let
us
in
gwyn
said
i
outrages
are
on
my
house
not
on
your
but
be
well
assured
that
whatever
injury
your
personal
property
may
sustain
it
is
contrary
to
my
wishes
and
will
by
me
be
amply
compensated
powers
exclaimed
she
precious
cabinet
and
all
my
furniture
will
be
demolished
wo
you
save
my
house
wo
you
dear
wo
you
house
cried
jerry
i
had
your
own
word
for
it
just
now
that
it
was
my
own
lady
house
so
if
you
told
a
lie
take
the
consequence
but
we
have
got
possession
and
let
me
see
who
will
dare
drive
us
out
they
are
that
will
soon
drive
you
out
cried
a
servant
they
are
here
they
are
echoed
every
one
all
eyes
were
now
directed
down
the
avenue
and
to
my
horror
i
perceived
a
large
party
of
soldiers
in
full
march
towards
the
house
shall
have
a
bloody
battle
of
it
whispered
jerry
never
fear
my
lady
we
will
fight
to
the
last
gasp
hollo
lads
here
is
a
battle
for
you
at
that
magic
word
all
the
irishmen
clubbed
their
sticks
and
ran
forward
must
surrender
said
i
could
i
bear
the
dreadful
contest
the
mother
that
bore
me
cried
jerry
will
defend
the
house
in
spite
of
you
i
will
walk
out
of
it
said
i
surrender
away
cried
jerry
may
all
the
oh
murder
murder
to
give
up
your
own
house
without
a
bit
of
a
battle
by
this
time
the
soldiers
had
arrived
and
the
magistrate
who
was
at
their
head
advanced
and
desired
me
to
have
the
door
opened
instantly
you
pledge
yourself
that
none
of
my
brave
fellows
shall
be
punished
answered
i
shall
all
be
punished
with
the
utmost
rigour
of
the
law
said
the
magistrate
that
is
the
case
then
cried
i
since
i
can
not
keep
possession
of
my
house
i
am
resolved
that
no
one
else
shall
know
sir
i
have
at
this
instant
six
of
my
domestics
each
with
a
lighted
brand
stationed
in
different
apartments
and
the
moment
you
order
your
men
to
advance
that
moment
i
give
the
signal
and
the
house
bursts
into
a
blaze
you
dare
cried
the
magistrate
cried
lady
gwyn
creature
would
dare
any
thing
dare
why
she
burned
a
house
once
before
she
did
i
protest
to
you
so
pray
make
some
conditions
with
her
or
she
will
burn
this
now
i
tell
you
the
girl
is
quite
and
she
whispered
something
in
the
ear
said
the
magistrate
to
me
you
promise
never
to
come
here
again
provided
i
now
let
you
and
your
gang
pass
without
detention
or
punishment

i
i
must
make
some
conditions
too

the
first
place

ladyship
give
me
back

cloaths
and
the
money
that
i
left
behind
me
when
i
was
here

her
ladyship
the
next
place
said
i
your
ladyship
promise
not
to
prevent
me
from
inhabiting
monkton
castle
till
such
time
as
the
law
shall
determine
which
of
us
has
a
right
to
the
contested
estates
replied
her
ladyship
now
said
i
must
have
the
distinct
and
solemn
declaration
of
every
individual
present
that
neither
myself
nor
my
people
shall
suffer
any
molestation
in
consequence
of
what
we
have
done
all
present
pledged
their
honours
then
said
i
will
open
the
door
accordingly
the
warden
opened
it
and
i
issued
forth
with
a
majestic
demeanour
while
my
awful
band
marched
after
their
triumphant
mistress
lady
gwyn
and
her
guests
hastened
into
the
house
without
even
wishing
me
good
evening
and
the
soldiers
drew
up
before
the
door
in
a
few
minutes
a
servant
came
out
with
my
dresses
and
the
money
having
received
them
i
got
into
my
barouche
and
drawn
by
my
vassals
proceeded
homeward
we
were
silent
for
some
time
but
at
length
i
called
jerry
to
the
side
of
the
carriage
my
friend
cried
i
quite
cheerful
think
we
have
come
off
famously

jerry

myself
added

a
good
day

jerry

not
think
we
have
obtained
the
most
decisive
advantages
was
it
not
a
glorious
affair
i
must
speak
out
cried
jerry
think
it
was
the
bluest
business
that
ever
was
botched
by
poltroons
was
all
your
own
doing
however
said
i
now
you
may
walk
on
sir
jerry
tossed
his
hat
at
one
side
and
strutted
forward
back
jerry
cried
i
is
my
hand
you
are
a
faithful
fellow
and
would
have
died
for
me
bless
you
cried
he
quarrel
like
a
cat
but
you
make
up
like
an
angel
it
was
night
before
we
reached
the
castle
and
as
i
had
not
tasted
a
morsel
all
day
i
dispatched
jerry
to
the
village
for
provisions
and
other
matters
i
then
divided
six
guineas
among
my
domestics
and
desired
them
to
return
next
morning
as
i
should
want
them
to
repair
the
fortifications
dig
a
mote
and
excavate
subterranean
passages
they
gave
three
cheers
and
departed
in
about
an
hour
jerry
returned
with
a
cart
containing
an
abundant
stock
of
provisions
bread
meat
potatoes
tea
sugar
besides
a
kettle
plates
cups
and
saucers
after
having
unloaded
and
dismissed
the
cart
we
made
a
fire
in
the
black
chamber
and
supped
i
then
took
a
solitary
walk
and
carried
some
victuals
to
the
poor
cottagers
they
received
the
donation
with
gratitude
and
i
left
them
to
the
comforts
of
a
hearty
meal
it
is
now
probable
that
i
may
reside
some
time
at
my
castle
and
as
to
my
villa
i
wish
lady
gwyn
joy
of
it
for
in
my
opinion
it
is
a
fright
conceive
the
difference
between
the
two
the
villa
mere
lath
and
plaster
with
its
pretty
little
and
its
pretty
little
paintings
and
its
pretty
little
bronzes
nice
new
sweet
and
charming
are
the
only
epithets
that
one
can
apply
to
it
while
antique
sublime
terrible
picturesque
and
gothic
are
the
adjectives
appropriate
to
my
castello
what
signify
laced
footmen
chinese
vases
grecian
tripods
and
turkish
sofas
in
comparison
with
feudal
vassals
ruined
towers
black
hangings
dampness
and
ivy
and
to
a
person
of
real
taste
a
single
stone
of
this
edifice
is
worth
a
whole
of
such
stones
as
the
onyx
and
sardonyx
and
the
other
barbarous
baubles
belonging
to
lady
gwyn
but
nothing
diverts
me
more
than
the
idea
that
poor
lady
gwyn
is
twice
as
old
as
the
house
she
lives
in
i
have
got
a
famous
simile
on
the
subject
what
think
you
of
a
decayed
nut
in
an
unripe
shell
the
woman
is
sixty
if
she
is

the
moist
shadows
of
night
had
fled
dawn
shook
the
dew
from
his
purple
ringlets
and
the
sun
that
gilder
of
eastern
turrets
arose
with
his
usual
punctuality
i
too
rose
and
having
now
recovered
my
wardrobe
enjoyed
the
luxury
of
changing
my
dress
for
i
had
worn
the
same
cloaths
several
days
and
consequently
was
become
a
perfect
slattern
how
other
heroines
manage
i
can
not
imagine
for
i
have
read
of
some
of
them
who
were
thrown
among
mountains
or
into
cells
and
desolate
chambers
and
caverns
full
of
slime
mud
vermin
dust
and
cobwebs
where
they
remained
whole
months
without
clean
linen
soap
brush
towel
or
comb
and
at
last
when
rescued
from
captivity
forth
they
walked
glittering
like
the
morning
star
as
fragrant
as
a
lily
and
as
fresh
as
an
oyster
we
breakfasted
on
the
top
of
the
tower
and
after
our
repast
the
minstrel
told
me
that
he
had
employed
the
day
before
in
composing
a
metrical
romance
called
castle
which
with
my
permission
he
would
now
repeat
i
was
delighted
and
to
give
it
every
advantage
i
placed
him
at
the
harp
flung
his
black
garments
over
him
and
making
him
sit
on
the
battlements
endeavoured
to
fix
him
in
the
fine
attitude
of
old
allan
bane
but
his
limbs
were
so
muscular
and
impracticable
that
i
could
make
nothing
of
them
with
an
emphatic
enunciation
he
thus
began

it
was
a
castle
of
turrets
grey
all
nettles
and
chickweed
inside
where
the
wind
did
howl
the
livelong
day
and
the
livelong
night
beside
it
had
no
windows

i

came
to
that

fair
cherubine
nor
the
wind
day
and
night
could
her
astound
nor
the
nettles
and
chickweed
that
grew
on
the
ground
she
was
of
the
house
of
de
willoughby
and
her
story
was
long
and
melancholie
but
her
beauty
never
could
rivalled
be
glittered
her
tresses
like
beams
of
sun
and
over
her
neck
did
run
her
cheek
where
dimples
made
beauteous
breach
lovelily
smiled
and
the
down
on
each
was
soft
as
fur
of
unfingered
peach
while
thro
her
marble
a
blush
did
gleam
like
ruddy
berries
all
crushed
in
cream
the
minstrel
to
the
castle
hied
his
mother
hope
his
mother
pride
gramercy
how
that
mother
cried
he
was
a
gentle
man
of
thought
and
grave
but
not
ungracious
aught
his
face
with
thinking
lines
was
wrought
and
though
his
head
was
bald
a
space
than
he
who
shore
it
will
get
grace
that
is
a
slap
at
me
cried
jerry
yet
though
he
sold
full
half
his
books
to
lay
out
money
on
his
looks
the
lady
had
such
deep
disdain
that
the
poor
minstrel
in
his
pain
from
the
hour
that
is
natal
to
the
hour
that
is
fatal
mote
sing
these
words
and
sing
in
vain
song
birds
are
all
singing
the
bells
are
all
ringing
and
tidings
are
bringing
of
peace
and
of
joy
then
let
us
my
treasure
in
love
without
measure
and
tenderest
pleasure
our
moments
what
what
all
that
cried
jerry
sure
body
sure
you
ant
oh
confound
me
but
is
making
love
to
the
mistress
you
are
the
minstrel
blushed
and
more
pointedly
repeated
but
her
favourite
warden
could
he
but
sing
he
not
unlistened
would
touch
the
string
tho
he
was
a
man
with
unchisseled
face
from
eye
to
eye
too
little
a
space
a
jester
withouten
one
attic
joke
and
the
greatest
liar
that
ever
spoke
luck
to
you
what
do
you
mean
by
that
cried
jerry
running
towards
him
will
box
you
for
a
shilling
are
not
worth
one
exclaimed
the
minstrel
starting
up
will
leave
your
carcase
not
worth
one
cried
jerry
would
be
more
than
your
is
worth
now
returned
the
minstrel
shame
my
friends
cried
i
higginson
i
declare
your
conduct
is
that
of
a
child
you
treat
me
like
one
said
he
you
treat
him
like
a
man
you
should
treat
him
like
a
gentleman
said
i
well
well
cried
the
minstrel
is
my
hand
for
you
mr
sullivan
there
is
mine
for
you
said
jerry
in
hand
is
better
than
fist
to
fist
at
any
time
will
defer
hearing
the
remainder
of
your
poem
said
i
you
have
altered
it
but
my
good
friend
do
not
forget
to
tell
that
i
inhabit
the
turret
and
to
give
a
full
description
of
it
you
might
begin
thus
he
who
would
view
that
east
turret
aright
must
go
at
morning
bright
morning
cried
jerry
how
can
the
morning
have
rosy
fingers
has
not
answered
i
poets
only
say
so
by
way
of
ornament
yet
cried
jerry
i
had
said
when
i
was
telling
you
my
history
that
i
saw
a
set
of
red
fingers
and
thumbs
rising
in
the
east
every
morning
i
warrant
you
would
have
called
me
a
liar
just
as
you
did
about
that
business
of
the
pacific
ocean
said
the
minstrel
poets
are
permitted
a
peculiar
latitude
of
language
which
enables
us
to
tell
homeric
falsehoods
without
fear
of
the
society
for
discountenancing
vice
thus
when
we
speak
of
the
lightning
of
her
angel
smile
we
do
not
expect
one
to
believe
that
fire
comes
out
of
her
mouth
whenever
it
laughs
unless
her
teeth
were
flints
said
jerry
if
you
said
that
fire
came
out
of
her
eyes
one
would
believe
you
sooner
for
this
i
know
that
many
and
many
a
time
molly
has
struck
fire
out
of
mine
heroine
eye
said
i
a
greater
scope
to
the
poet
than
any
thing
in
the
world
it
is
all
fire
and
water
if
it
is
not
beaming
or
sparkling
it
is
sure
to
be
drowned
or
swimming
the
pacific
ocean
i
hope
cried
jerry
but
in
tears
said
the
minstrel
of
these
there
is
an
infinite
variety
there
is
the
big
tear
and
the
bitter
tear
and
the
salt
tear
and
the
scalding
tear
ah
cried
i
delightful
when
two
lovers
lay
cheek
to
cheek
and
mingle
these
tears
or
when
the
tender
youth
kisses
them
from
his
mistress
cheek
then
that
must
be
no
small
compliment
said
jerry
they
are
so
brackish
and
scalding
as
you
say
water
itself
is
maukish
at
any
time
but
salt
water
is
the
devil
well
if
i
took
such
a
dose
of
a
snivelling
chit
tears
i
would
season
it
with
a
dram
or
my
name
is
not
jerry
by
the
by
i
wish
jerry
were
not
your
name
said
i
so
vulgar
for
a
warden
indeed
i
have
often
thought
of
altering
it
to
which
i
fancy
is
the
italian
of
for
in
my
opinion
nothing
can
equal
italian
names
ending
in
o
irish
names
beginning
with
o
cried
jerry
said
i
can
be
finer
than
montalto
stefano
morano
rinaldo
ubaldo
utaldo
will
tell
you
said
jerry
ecstasy
exclaimed
a
voice
just
beneath
the
turret
i
looked
down
and
beheld
montmorenci
himself
clad
in
armour
and
gazing
up
at
me
with
an
attitude
that
mocked
mortal
pencil
i
waved
my
hand
and
smiled
whom
do
i
behold
cried
he
is
but
a
dream
yet
i
spoke
to
her
i
am
sure
i
spoke
to
her
and
she
beckoned
me
merciful
powers
why
this
terror
is
it
not
cherubina
and
would
cherubina
hurt
her
montmorenci
jerry
said
i
down
to
the
black
chamber
and
clean
it
out
quick
sweep
the
ashes
into
a
corner
hide
the
pipkin
and
kettle
pin
up
the
cloaks
against
the
walls
put
the
leg
of
mutton
under
the
bed
run
my
lord
the
lady
cherubina
hastes
to
receive
your
lordship
at
her
portal
i
then
descended
and
met
him
beneath
the
gateway
his
greeting
was
frantic
but
decorous
mine
endearing
but
reserved
several
very
elegant
things
were
said
on
both
sides
of
course
he
snatched
my
hand
and
fed
upon
it
at
last
when
i
supposed
that
jerry
had
regulated
the
room
above
i
conducted
his
lordship
up
the
steps
while
i
anticipated
his
delight
at
beholding
so
legendary
fatal
and
inconvenient
a
chamber
his
astonishment
was
indeed
excessive
he
stared
round
and
round
admired
the
black
hangings
the
bed
the
bell
and
the
horn
see
said
he
advancing
to
the
ashes
you
are
even
classical
enough
to
burn
a
fire
of
wood
but
ha
and
he
started
what
do
mine
eyes
behold
beneath
these
embers
a
bone
by
all
that
is
horrible
perhaps
part
of
the
skeleton
of
some
hysterical
innocent
or
some
pathetic
count
who
was
murdered
centuries
ago
in
the
haunted
apartment
of
this
mysterious
castle
interesting
relic
speak
lady
cherubina
is
it
as
i
suspect
said
i
believe
that
is
to
say
for
aught
i
can
tell
my
conscience
cried
jerry
ladyship
knows
just
as
well
as
i
do
that
is
nothing
but
the
of
mutton
which
she
got
broiled
for
her
supper
last
night
sir
exclaimed
his
lordship
heroine
never
eats
of
a
animal
is
always
the
leg
of
a
lark
or
the
wing
of
a
chicken
and
so
saying
he
began
divesting
himself
of
his
spear
shield
and
helmet
blunderer
whispered
i
to
jerry
i
not
desire
you
to
clean
out
the
room
did
not
say
a
word
about
the
said
jerry
did
i
not
bid
you
clean
out
the
room
repeated
i
i
tell
you
cried
jerry
you
speak
low
said
i
i
tell
you
that
not
one
syllable
about
the
ever
came
outside
your
lips
me
patience
said
i
me
yes
or
no
did
i
or
did
i
not
order
you
to
clean
out
the
room
bad
luck
to
me
said
he
you
ant
all
this
time
confounding
the
of
mutton
with
the
leg
of
mutton
that
you
bade
me
put
under
the
bed
and
accordingly
goodness
said
i
you
speak
within
your
breath
accordingly
whispered
he
put
it
under
the
velvet
pall
because
i
thought
it
might
be
seen
under
the
bed
that
shewed
discretion
said
i
after
all
my
pains
said
jerry
is
the
man
in
the
tin
cloaths
has
just
stripped
down
that
same
pall
and
discovered
the
mutton
and
the
parsnips
and
the
bag
of
salt
and
the
pewter
spoons
and
jerry
jerry
said
i
dropping
my
arms
lifeless
at
my
sides
that
i
give
you
up
i
then
called
to
his
lordship
and
drew
off
his
attention
by
beginning
an
account
of
all
that
had
happened
since
our
parting
he
listened
with
great
eagerness
and
after
my
recital
begged
of
the
warden
to
retire
with
him
that
they
might
consult
on
the
best
line
of
policy
to
be
adopted
in
the
present
state
of
my
affairs
they
descended
the
steps
i
remained
alone
montmorenci
had
left
his
helmet
shield
and
spear
behind
i
pressed
each
of
them
to
my
heart
heaved
several
sighs
and
paced
the
chamber
still
i
felt
that
i
was
not
half
fervent
or
tender
enough
something
was
still
wanting
and
i
had
just
asked
myself
if
that
something
could
be
love
when
i
heard
a
sudden
disturbance
below
his
lordship
crying
out
what
shall
i
do
and
jerry
bidding
him
and
bear
it
down
i
hastened
and
beheld
jerry
belabouring
him
without
mercy
cried
i
rushing
between
them
till
i
beat
him
to
a
paste
cried
jerry
villain
to
go
and
offer
me
a
bribe
if
i
would
help
him
in
forcing
you
to
marry
him
false
as
hell
cried
his
lordship
would
stake
my
life
that
it
is
said
i
now
sullivan
down
on
your
knees
this
moment
and
ask
pardon
or
quit
my
service
can
that
restore
the
teeth
he
has
knocked
out
exclaimed
his
lordship
with
a
finger
in
his
mouth
cried
i
shuddering
teeth
said
he
teeth
exclaimed
i
faintly
front
teeth
said
he
all
is
over
muttered
i
have
taken
a
dreadful
turn
do
you
mean
cried
he
lord
said
i
you
quite
quite
certain
that
you
have
lost
them
yourself
cried
he
lifting
his
lip
are
gone
gone
for
ever
are
indeed
said
i
now
you
may
be
gone
too
what
mean
you
cried
he
lord
said
i
this
you
must
be
conscious
that
a
complete
set
of
teeth
are
absolutely
indispensible
to
a
hero
cried
he
starting
said
i
lost
two
of
your
you
must
be
conscious
that
you
are
no
longer
a
hero
stretch
my
cried
he
what
hideous
whim
is
this
whim
my
lord
answered
i
principle
and
founded
on
law
heroic
founded
on
that
law
which
rejects
as
heroes
the
maimed
the
blind
the
deformed
and
the
crippled
trust
me
my
good
lord
teeth
are
just
as
necessary
in
the
formation
of
a
hero
as
a
comb
heaven
cried
he
can
get
other
teeth
at
a
dentist
a
composition
of
paste
that
would
amaze
you
i
can
by
all
that
is
just
you
may
my
lord
said
i
be
happy
with
them
for
never
can
you
be
happy
with
me
am
wilder
than
madness
itself
cried
he
am
more
desperate
than
despair
i
will
fly
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
hide
in
a
cavern
and
throw
my
ideas
into
a
sonnet
on
a
fine
summer
evening
when
you
walk
towards
the
mountains
sometimes
think
of
me
as
a
lover
my
lord
said
i
put
that
out
of
your
head
at
once
oh
it
shocks
me
to
think
i
should
ever
have
received
you
as
one
he
began
a
tremendous
imprecation
but
was
interrupted
by
the
sudden
arrival
of
a
gentleman
on
horseback
with
a
servant
after
him
the
gentleman
stopped
alighted
approached
betterton
cried
i
it
be
possible
is
impossible
said
he
with
his
obsequious
bow
and
confirmed
smile
the
charming
cherubina
prompts
our
efforts
you
remember
you
left
me
in
a
ridiculous
dilemma
which
your
friend
stuart
contrived
masterpiece
of
ingenuity
faith
and
for
which
i
freely
forgive
him
he
an
excellent
young
fellow
excellent
my
soul
and
i
have
made
my
friends
so
merry
with
an
account
of
that
affair
well
i
remained
in
limbo
till
the
sessions
when
none
appearing
to
prosecute
the
judge
discharged
me
so
the
first
use
i
made
of
my
liberty
was
to
visit
lady
gwyn
who
told
me
that
i
should
find
you
here
here
therefore
i
am
to
pay
you
my
devoirs
i
thanked
him
and
then
bade
jerry
run
towards
the
village
and
hurry
my
vassals
as
the
castle
lost
much
of
its
pomp
without
them
jerry
went
my
visitors
recognized
each
other
and
already
their
hostile
feelings
and
opposite
interests
had
began
to
manifest
themselves
when
to
my
great
surprise
three
men
turned
short
round
the
western
tower
and
stood
before
me
is
she
cried
one
of
them
i
looked
at
the
speaker
and
recognized
in
him
the
postilion
who
had
brought
down
the
barouche
name
is
cherry
wilkinson
said
another
of
them
to
me
said
i
haughtily
name
is
lady
cherubina
de
willoughby
is
your
name
rejoined
he
your
real
name
i
discovered
at
your
lodgings
in
which
lodgings
i
found
out
from
the
wife
of
one
jerry
sullivan
the
man
that
conspired
with
you
to
swindle
perrot
the
out
of
the
barouche
yonder
you
see
i
have
the
whole
story
so
you
need
not
deny
it
and
now
miss
look
at
this
warrant
i
arrest
you
in
the
king
name
for
the
most
audacious
piece
of
swindling
that
ever
came
in
my
way
to
know
with
these
words
he
seized
me
and
was
dragging
me
from
the
castle
while
i
screamed
for
help
rescue
a
rescue
cried
betterton
and
collared
the
man
who
held
me
montmorenci
laid
hold
of
the
other
and
the
servant
felled
the
postilion
to
the
ground
and
now
a
furious
fight
began
the
man
whom
betterton
had
seized
drew
a
pistol
and
fired
it
at
this
moment
down
came
the
minstrel
from
the
turret
i
got
loose
and
ran
into
the
castle
nor
ventured
to
look
again
till
after
much
uproar
i
heard
a
shout
of
victory
from
my
friends
then
venturing
to
the
gateway
i
saw
the
three
wretches
limping
from
the
place
in
piteous
plight
it
now
appeared
that
the
ball
aimed
at
betterton
had
just
grazed
the
fleshy
part
of
his
servant
arm
which
was
bleeding
a
good
deal
i
felt
much
shocked
and
assisted
him
in
binding
the
wound
this
matter
employed
some
minutes
and
during
that
time
i
could
perceive
betterton
and
montmorenci
whispering
earnestly
together
at
last
betterton
addressed
me
thus
lady
cherubina
should
we
remain
here
much
longer
we
shall
certainly
be
seized
and
imprisoned
for
having
assaulted
his
officers
in
the
discharge
of
their
duty
we
have
therefore
nothing
for
it
but
flight
my
house
is
but
a
few
miles
distant
and
as
these
officers
could
not
have
known
me
we
shall
be
perfectly
safe
there
what
says
your
ladyship
shall
we
repair
thither
answered
i
i
was
not
concerned
in
that
assault
and
as
i
am
innocent
of
the
crime
for
which
they
came
to
take
me
nothing
shall
induce
me
to
quit
my
castle
if
they
chuse
to
make
another
attempt
i
shall
go
with
them
establish
my
innocence
and
return
triumphant
but
if
i
am
to
act
on
the
skulking
system
how
can
i
reside
here
at
all
montmorenci
now
joined
his
entreaties
but
i
remained
immoveable
again
they
retired
to
consult
and
again
came
forward
cherubina
said
betterton
must
excuse
me
when
i
say
that
both
lord
montmorenci
for
his
lordship
has
just
disclosed
to
me
his
noble
lineage
and
myself
conceive
ourselves
fully
warranted
in
compelling
if
we
can
not
persuade
your
ladyship
to
leave
this
castle
where
we
can
not
remain
to
protect
you
and
in
conveying
you
to
my
mansion
where
you
will
be
safe
me
cried
i
me
but
i
disdain
to
hold
farther
parley
with
you
farewell
for
ever
minstrel
follow
me
to
the
black
chamber
them
cried
betterton
his
lordship
placed
himself
between
us
and
the
gateway
the
minstrel
brandishing
his
collected
knuckles
struck
him
to
the
ground
betterton
assailed
my
brave
defender
behind
the
servant
before
but
he
fought
with
desperation
and
his
blow
was
like
the
kick
of
a
horse
still
numbers
appeared
about
to
prevail
and
now
his
breathing
grew
shorter
and
his
blow
slower
when
transport
to
my
sight
i
beheld
jerry
with
several
of
my
vassals
come
running
towards
us
they
reached
us
the
tide
of
battle
turns
and
his
lordship
and
the
servant
are
well
beaten
with
bludgeons
while
jerry
himself
does
the
honours
to
betterton
in
a
kicking
nobody
could
bear
it
more
gently
than
he
did
and
after
it
was
over
he
mounted
his
horse
and
vociferated
by
all
that
is
sacred
i
will
go
this
moment
raise
the
neighbourhood
and
have
you
driven
from
your
nest
you
set
of
vipers
you
common
nuisances
you
lady
gwyn
castle
shall
no
longer
be
made
the
receptacle
of
ragged
and
marauding
irishmen
so
saying
off
he
gallopped
on
one
horse
and
his
lordship
on
another
while
the
servant
trudged
on
foot
we
now
held
a
grand
council
of
war
for
affairs
began
to
wear
an
alarming
aspect
if
betterton
should
put
his
threat
of
raising
the
neighbourhood
into
execution
a
most
formidable
force
might
be
collected
against
us
after
much
deliberation
therefore
it
was
decided
that
some
of
the
vassals
should
be
dispatched
to
collect
more
of
their
countrymen
who
they
said
slept
in
several
adjoining
villages
i
too
wrote
a
note
to
susan
begging
that
she
would
raise
a
counterposse
in
my
favour
and
rescue
me
from
an
implacable
enemy
as
i
had
rescued
her
from
a
criminal
and
fatal
attachment
this
note
i
sent
to
her
cottage
by
one
of
my
vassals
during
this
awful
interval
the
remainder
of
those
who
had
been
with
me
yesterday
arrived
i
planted
sentinels
and
outposts
and
employed
the
rest
in
filling
up
the
windows
with
stones
repairing
the
breaches
and
searching
amidst
the
rubbish
for
the
mouth
of
some
subterranean
cavern
where
i
might
conceal
myself
in
the
last
emergency
as
i
had
not
a
white
and
azure
standard
like
beatrice
i
directed
jerry
to
stain
a
large
piece
of
muslin
with
the
blood
of
the
wounded
servant
which
still
besprinkled
the
grass
then
to
fasten
it
on
a
long
pole
and
hoist
it
as
my
banner
at
an
angle
of
the
eastern
turret
susan
cottage
being
only
half
a
mile
from
the
castle
the
messenger
soon
returned
with
an
answer
that
she
would
certainly
assemble
her
friends
and
come
to
me
just
as
he
had
announced
these
happy
tidings
another
came
back
with
a
fresh
accession
of
ten
irishmen
and
in
a
short
time
more
arrived
till
at
length
we
mustered
to
the
amount
of
fifty
i
stood
and
gloried
in
my
strength
already
i
beheld
the
foundation
of
a
feudal
settlement
already
i
considered
myself
the
restorer
of
that
chivalric
age
when
neighbouring
barons
were
deadly
foes
and
their
sons
and
daughters
clandestine
lovers
ah
what
times
for
a
heroine
it
was
then
that
the
lady
buccleugh
and
the
duchess
of
cleves
flourished
these
cried
i
in
an
ecstasy
of
enthusiasm
shall
again
revive
in
the
person
of
lady
cherubina
de
willoughby
as
i
spoke
jerry
came
to
tell
me
that
one
of
the
scouts
had
just
returned
with
information
of
his
having
seen
a
large
party
of
lady
gwyn
tenants
assembling
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
in
order
as
he
found
on
inquiry
to
drive
us
from
the
castle
now
then
was
approaching
the
most
important
moment
of
my
life
and
i
resolved
to
support
my
part
with
dignity
as
the
first
step
i
dressed
myself
in
a
style
of
magnificence
suited
to
the
occasion
having
flung
the
drapery
of
embroidered
gauze
over
my
white
muslin
i
next
in
imitation
of
ancient
heroines
who
wore
armour
in
the
day
of
battle
put
montmorenci
helmet
on
my
head
then
with
his
shield
in
the
one
hand
and
his
spear
in
the
other
never
did
i
look
so
lovely
i
now
called
up
the
warden
and
constituted
him
commander
of
the
forces
then
ordered
him
to
send
six
picked
men
and
the
minstrel
as
my
up
to
the
black
chamber
they
came
i
equipped
them
in
black
cloaks
and
feathers
and
made
them
mount
to
the
top
of
the
tower
in
a
few
minutes
afterwards
i
myself
ascended
with
a
beating
heart
there
i
found
the
preparations
for
battle
almost
completed
the
bloody
standard
was
streaming
to
the
gale
the
were
collecting
a
heap
of
stones
from
the
broken
parapet
while
beneath
the
turret
i
beheld
the
whole
of
my
troops
with
oaken
staffs
marshalled
in
awful
array
the
spectacle
was
grand
and
imposing
lightly
i
leaned
on
my
spear
and
while
my
feathered
casque
pressed
my
ringlets
and
my
purfled
drapery
floated
and
glistened
in
the
sun
i
stood
on
the
battlements
mildly
sublime
sweetly
stern
amiable
in
arms
and
adorned
with
all
the
terrible
graces
of
beauty
belligerent
i
now
resolved
to
harangue
my
men
for
the
purpose
of
encouraging
them
and
of
attaching
them
to
my
person
but
as
i
knew
nothing
of
political
orations
i
had
nothing
for
it
but
to
copy
the
speech
of
beatrice
in
the
knights
of
the
swan
and
those
that
i
had
read
in
the
daily
prints
a
profound
silence
prevailed
i
waved
my
spear
and
thus
began
brave
associates
partners
of
my
toil
my
feelings
and
my
fame
two
days
have
i
now
been
sovereign
of
this
castle
and
i
hope
i
may
flatter
myself
that
i
have
added
to
its
prosperity
young
and
without
experience
i
merely
claim
the
merit
of
blameless
sentiments
and
intentions
with
a
barbarous
incursion
from
my
deadliest
enemies
i
have
deemed
it
indispensible
to
collect
a
faithful
band
of
vassals
for
my
defence
they
have
come
at
my
call
and
i
thank
them
promise
to
them
all
such
laws
and
institutions
as
shall
secure
their
happiness
i
will
acknowledge
the
majesty
of
the
people
i
will
give
to
them
a
full
fair
and
free
representation
and
i
will
grant
to
them
a
radical
reform
or
in
other
words
a
revival
of
the
feudal
system
of
i
will
assume
no
monarchial
prerogatives
that
are
unjust
if
i
should
do
not
forget
that
the
people
have
always
the
power
and
the
right
to
depose
a
tyrant
promise
that
there
shall
be
no
dilapidated
hopes
and
resources
no
army
of
mercenaries
no
army
of
spies
no
inquisition
of
private
property
no
degraded
aristocracy
no
oppressed
people
no
confiding
parliament
no
irresponsible
minister
in
short
i
promise
every
thing
of
man
shall
have
an
acre
of
ground
a
cottage
and
an
annual
salary
life
to
you
cried
the
troops
that
is
the
best
thing
you
have
said
such
is
the
constitution
such
are
the
privileges
that
i
propound
to
you
now
then
my
brave
fellows
will
you
consent
on
these
conditions
to
rally
round
my
standard
to
live
in
my
service
and
to
die
in
my
defence
will
we
will
cried
you
my
generous
followers
and
the
crisis
is
just
approaching
when
i
shall
have
occasion
for
your
most
strenuous
exertions
already
my
mortal
foe
prepares
to
storm
my
castle
and
drive
me
from
my
hereditary
domain
already
he
has
excited
my
own
tenantry
to
sedition
against
me
should
he
succeed
in
his
atrocious
object
i
must
return
to
my
tears
and
you
to
your
sickles
but
should
we
repel
him
my
government
will
be
secured
my
territory
perhaps
enlarged
my
castle
rebuilt
and
the
cause
of
liberty
will
triumph
what
heart
but
throbs
what
voice
but
shouts
at
the
name
of
liberty
is
there
a
man
amongst
you
who
would
refuse
to
lay
down
his
life
for
liberty
and
if
on
an
important
occasion
like
the
present
i
might
take
the
liberty
to
dictate
i
would
demand
of
you
this
day
to
sacrifice
every
earthly
consideration
in
her
sacred
cause
i
do
demand
it
of
you
my
friends
i
call
upon
your
feelings
your
principles
and
your
policy
to
discard
family
property
and
life
in
a
cause
so
just
so
wise
and
so
glorious
let
eye
foot
heart
hand
be
firm
be
stern
be
valiant
be
invincible
i
ceased
the
soldiery
tore
the
blue
air
with
acclamations
and
the
ravens
overhead
flew
swifter
at
the
sound
i
now
found
that
it
was
not
difficult
to
make
a
popular
speech
and
i
judged
that
the
same
qualities
which
have
made
me
so
good
a
heroine
would
if
i
were
a
man
have
made
me
just
as
illustrious
a
patriot
after
much
entreaty
i
persuaded
the
minstrel
to
deliver
an
address
as
he
being
learned
might
expound
constitutions
and
political
economy
better
than
i
he
therefore
leaned
over
the
battlements
and
began
as
i
am
to
public
speaking
i
feel
that
words
are
inadequate
to
express
my
high
sense
of
the
honour
you
have
conferred
upon
us
gentlemen
i
will
institute
an
apt
comparison
between
the
foundation
of
this
little
settlement
and
that
of
the
ancient
romans
in
order
to
prove
that
this
though
small
at
present
may
like
that
terminate
in
an
extensive
empire
gentlemen
rome
took
its
rise
from
a
set
of
the
greatest
beggars
and
reprobates
that
ever
crawled
upon
earth
him
over
throw
him
over
burst
from
the
troops
the
minstrel
shrunk
back
in
consternation
lads
cried
jerry
i
will
make
a
bit
of
a
speech
for
you
but
instead
of
sending
you
to
rome
i
will
send
you
no
farther
than
ballinasloe
and
bravo
eh
my
boys
do
you
remember
the
good
old
fun
at
the
fair
there
to
be
sure
how
we
used
to
break
each
other
heads
without
the
least
anger
or
mercy
and
to
be
sure
is
the
finest
feel
in
the
world
when
one
gives
a
fellow
a
neat
clean
bothering
blow
over
the
skull
and
down
he
drops
like
a
sack
then
rises
and
shakes
himself
like
a
wet
dog
and
begins
again
ay
my
boys
fighting
may
be
an
englishman
or
a
frenchman
business
but
by
the
lord
harry
is
an
amusement
so
now
hearties
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
club
your
sticks
and
fancy
yourselves
at
ballinasloe
and
never
heed
me
if
we
hav
a
nice
comfortable
fight
of
it
rude
as
was
this
rhetoric
it
touched
the
domestic
spring
of
their
hearts
and
my
patriotic
promises
did
not
produce
half
such
a
roar
of
delight
as
followed
it
silence
was
but
just
restored
when
i
beheld
from
my
turret
our
enemies
advancing
in
vast
numbers
across
the
common
i
confess
my
heart
sank
at
the
sight
but
i
soon
called
to
mind
the
courage
of
the
feudal
heroines
and
recollected
that
i
was
in
no
personal
danger
myself
then
the
greatness
of
the
cause
animating
me
with
ardour
i
exclaimed
yonder
come
our
enemies
to
arms
to
arms
sound
the
tocsin
blow
blow
the
horn
a
vassal
blew
the
horn
the
warden
then
stationed
his
men
in
front
of
the
which
was
the
only
vulnerable
entrance
into
the
castle
and
my
holding
huge
stones
stood
forward
on
the
battlements
all
was
ready
i
trembled
with
agitation
and
now
the
foe
having
approached
within
fifty
paces
halted
to
reconnoitre
the
traitor
montmorenci
divested
of
his
armour
commanded
them
in
person
betterton
was
seen
on
horseback
at
a
distance
and
the
troops
themselves
about
sixty
in
number
stood
brandishing
stakes
bludgeons
and
poles
as
my
men
were
not
more
than
fifty
in
all
i
looked
round
with
anxious
expectation
for
the
succours
promised
by
susan
but
no
sign
of
them
appeared
montmorenci
now
began
to
form
his
troops
into
a
compact
phalanx
with
the
poles
and
stakes
in
front
evidently
for
the
purpose
of
piercing
our
line
and
forcing
the
gateway
jerry
therefore
called
in
his
wings
and
strengthened
the
centre
he
then
desired
those
in
the
turret
to
direct
all
their
stones
against
the
foremost
rank
of
the
foe
cried
i
to
my
last
commands
the
moment
you
shall
hear
the
horn
sound
again
whether
in
the
midst
of
conquest
or
of
defeat
hurry
back
to
the
gateway
and
draw
up
just
as
you
stand
at
present
for
while
you
are
fighting
at
a
distance
my
castle
may
be
taken
by
surprise
unless
i
secure
prompt
assistance
and
now
my
brave
fellows
success
attend
your
arms
as
i
spoke
the
foe
began
advancing
at
a
rapid
rate
my
troops
awaited
them
with
firmness
and
when
they
had
approached
within
fifteen
paces
of
the
castle
i
gave
the
word
to
my
who
hurled
several
vollies
of
stones
in
quick
succession
some
of
the
foremost
rank
were
staggered
by
them
two
behind
fell
and
amidst
the
confusion
in
rushed
my
troops
with
a
tremendous
shout
thick
pressed
the
throng
of
waving
heads
and
loud
grew
the
clamour
of
voices
and
the
clatter
of
staffs
while
the
wielded
weapons
appeared
and
disappeared
like
fragments
of
a
wreck
on
the
tossing
surges
for
some
moments
both
armies
fought
in
one
unbroken
mass
those
struggling
to
gain
the
gateway
these
to
prevent
them
but
soon
as
two
streams
rushing
from
opposite
mountains
and
meeting
in
the
valley
broaden
into
a
lake
and
run
off
in
little
rivulets
so
the
contending
ranks
after
the
first
encounter
began
to
spread
by
degrees
and
scatter
over
the
plain
and
now
they
were
seen
intermingled
with
each
other
and
fighting
man
to
man
here
a
small
wing
of
my
brave
troops
hemmed
in
on
all
sides
were
defending
themselves
with
incredible
fury
there
a
larger
division
of
them
were
maintaining
a
doubtful
contest
while
a
few
straggling
vassals
engaged
in
single
combat
at
a
distance
were
driving
their
antagonists
before
them
at
this
juncture
montmorenci
with
a
chosen
band
that
he
kept
round
his
person
had
attacked
the
warden
and
a
few
who
fought
by
his
side
these
performed
prodigies
of
valour
but
at
last
overpowered
by
numbers
they
were
beginning
to
retire
covered
with
glory
when
i
dispatched
four
of
my
as
a
corps
of
reserve
to
their
assistance
they
rushed
upon
the
chosen
band
and
checked
its
career
it
soon
received
reinforcements
and
again
pressed
forward
i
sent
out
the
minstrel
and
another
vassal
and
again
its
progress
was
checked
but
now
my
castle
had
but
a
single
defender
our
foes
were
drawing
frightfully
near
and
if
they
could
once
turn
our
flank
they
would
gain
the
turret
and
make
me
their
prisoner
this
was
the
great
crisis
a
moment
more
and
all
might
be
lost
blow
the
horn
cried
i
the
vassal
blew
the
horn
at
the
signal
i
see
my
dispersed
troops
come
pouring
from
all
quarters
towards
the
castle
they
reach
the
gateway
halt
and
form
a
front
before
it
the
foe
who
had
followed
them
in
a
confused
manner
seeing
them
on
a
sudden
so
formidable
stop
short
the
come
into
the
castle
cried
i
the
obeyed
soldiers
cried
i
to
the
rest
you
rush
upon
the
foe
before
they
can
collect
again
and
keep
in
a
body
with
your
captain
the
day
is
our
own
on
them
like
lions
away
away
the
whole
army
shouted
and
burst
forward
in
a
mass
jerry
led
the
van
montmorenci
with
his
sacred
squadron
fled
before
them
they
pursued
overtook
the
fugitives
and
after
a
short
skirmish
made
the
whole
detachment
prisoners
while
the
remainder
scattered
in
all
directions
stood
at
a
distance
and
dared
not
advance
never
was
a
more
decisive
victory
my
brave
veterans
marched
back
in
triumph
with
eight
captives
and
then
halting
at
the
gateway
gave
three
cheers
palpitating
with
transport
i
commanded
that
the
prisoners
hands
should
be
tied
behind
their
backs
and
that
they
should
be
confined
in
the
northern
tower
with
sentinels
over
them
as
for
lord
montmorenci
his
rank
entitled
him
to
more
respect
so
i
ordered
the
warden
to
conduct
him
up
to
the
black
chamber
i
stood
in
the
midst
of
my
guards
to
receive
him
and
if
ever
grandeur
and
suavity
were
blended
in
one
countenance
it
was
in
mine
at
that
glorious
moment
lord
said
i
which
so
long
hovered
over
the
field
with
doubtful
wing
has
at
last
descended
on
my
legions
and
crowned
the
scale
of
justice
with
the
laurel
of
triumph
but
though
it
has
also
put
the
person
and
the
fate
of
the
hostile
chieftain
in
my
hands
think
not
i
mean
to
use
my
power
with
harshness
within
these
walls
your
lordship
shall
experience
the
kindest
treatment
but
beyond
them
you
must
not
be
permitted
to
go
till
my
rights
are
and
my
rebellious
vassals
restored
to
their
allegiance
lal
la
lal
lal
la
said
his
lordship
stepping
a
minuet
him
hand
and
foot
cried
i
quite
disgusted
and
enraged
will
have
no
minuets
in
this
castle
i
will
do
cried
jerry
his
feet
are
nimble
enough
at
making
off
though
he
talks
big
he
runs
fast
the
creature
is
all
voice
and
legs
like
a
grasshopper
just
as
the
minstrel
and
warden
had
secured
his
wrists
and
ankles
with
a
handkerchief
a
vassal
came
to
tell
me
that
a
number
of
men
and
a
girl
at
their
head
were
running
towards
the
castle
thought
she
would
not
disappoint
me
cried
i
as
i
hastened
down
to
meet
her
it
was
indeed
susan
herself
and
a
train
of
youths
i
stood
at
the
gateway
ready
to
receive
her
and
trembling
with
terror
lest
betterton
and
the
routed
remains
of
his
army
who
were
now
consulting
together
at
some
distance
should
intercept
her
these
fears
were
not
at
all
lessened
when
i
saw
her
stop
as
she
arrived
amongst
them
and
converse
with
them
some
time
i
made
my
men
hold
themselves
in
readiness
to
support
her
and
we
shouted
to
her
with
all
our
might
but
just
judge
of
my
consternation
when
i
beheld
her
and
her
party
enrolling
themselves
in
the
hostile
ranks
and
the
whole
allied
force
preparing
to
pour
down
upon
us
i
stood
her
ingratitude
her
perfidy
were
incredible
but
i
had
no
time
for
moral
reflection
my
own
glory
and
the
interests
of
my
people
demanded
all
my
thoughts
what
was
i
to
do
we
had
taken
but
eight
prisoners
and
these
too
would
require
a
strong
guard
while
the
traiterous
susan
had
brought
a
reinforcement
of
twenty
men
to
the
foe
so
that
to
contend
against
such
superior
numbers
in
the
field
would
be
madness
i
determined
therefore
to
draw
all
my
troops
and
all
my
prisoners
into
the
eastern
turret
and
to
stand
a
regular
siege
for
as
we
had
a
large
stock
of
provisions
we
might
hold
out
several
days
in
the
mean
time
our
enemies
tired
of
such
a
protracted
mode
of
warfare
and
having
other
occupations
of
more
importance
would
probably
retire
and
leave
us
in
quiet
possession
this
plan
was
put
into
instant
execution
i
had
the
prisoners
placed
in
the
black
chamber
with
a
numerous
guard
and
i
made
the
remainder
of
my
soldiery
man
the
battlements
these
arrangements
were
but
just
completed
when
i
beheld
our
formidable
opponents
advancing
in
line
with
betterton
on
horseback
at
their
head
again
my
men
armed
themselves
with
stones
again
the
horn
was
sounded
again
three
cheers
were
given
when
the
besiegers
had
arrived
within
forty
paces
of
us
they
halted
then
betterton
waving
a
white
handkerchief
advanced
under
the
walls
and
spoke
thus
cherubina
de
willoughby
i
demand
of
you
to
surrender
at
discretion
refuse
and
i
pledge
myself
that
in
five
minutes
i
will
drive
the
leopard
into
the
sea
and
plant
my
standard
on
the
towers
of
monkton
i
both
refuse
and
defy
you
my
castle
is
impregnable
to
hunger
at
least
cried
betterton
we
will
turn
the
siege
into
a
blockade
to
hunger
exclaimed
the
minstrel
flinging
down
half
a
loaf
of
bread
that
had
remained
since
breakfast
sir
is
a
proof
of
it
deduced
from
the
roman
history
i
perceive
that
war
is
inevitable
said
betterton
shall
stand
acquitted
both
here
and
hereafter
for
all
its
consequences
by
my
now
just
going
through
the
form
of
proposing
a
general
pacification
ocean
cried
jerry
thank
you
i
have
got
a
surfeit
of
that
word
already
my
honest
fellow
me
cried
jerry
wo
take
old
boy
so
bad
manners
to
you
and
that
is
worse
than
bad
luck
go
boil
your
tongue
hard
like
a
calve
and
then
it
wo
wag
so
glib
and
smooth
ay
and
go
boil
your
nose
white
like
veal
too
but
this
i
can
tell
you
that
you
will
neither
beat
us
out
nor
starve
us
out
for
we
have
sticks
and
stones
and
meat
and
good
liquor
and
we
will
eat
together
and
drink
together
and
sleep
together
i
suppose
cried
betterton
of
course
her
ladyship
will
think
nothing
of
sleeping
in
the
same
apartment
with
twenty
or
thirty
men
the
fatal
words
fell
upon
me
like
a
thunderbolt
it
was
indeed
too
true
that
a
large
portion
of
my
troops
must
remain
all
night
in
the
black
chamber
as
there
would
be
no
room
for
them
elsewhere
so
how
in
the
name
of
wonder
could
i
contrive
to
sleep
certain
it
is
that
ellena
di
rosalba
travelled
a
whole
day
and
night
in
a
carriage
with
two
ruffians
who
never
left
her
for
a
moment
and
it
was
not
till
after
luxima
and
the
missionary
had
journeyed
together
several
entire
days
that
to
quote
the
very
words
the
first
time
since
the
commencement
of
their
pilgrimage
she
was
hidden
from
his
how
these
heroines
managed
i
know
not
but
this
i
know
that
i
could
not
abide
the
idea
of
sleeping
in
the
presence
of
men
and
yet
to
surrender
my
sweet
my
beloved
my
venerable
castle
the
hereditary
seat
of
my
proud
progenitors
at
the
moment
of
an
immortal
victory
ere
the
laurel
was
yet
warmed
on
the
throbbings
of
my
forehead
and
all
for
what
for
the
most
pitiful
and
unclassical
reason
that
ever
disgraced
a
human
creature
why
i
should
be
pointed
at
scouted
at
look
there
is
the
heroine
who
surrendered
her
castle
because
and
then
a
whisper
and
a
titter
and
a
fact
my
honour
oh
my
friend
my
friend
the
thought
was
madness
i
considered
and
reconsidered
but
every
moment
only
strengthened
me
more
and
more
in
the
conviction
that
there
was
no
remedy
said
i
jerry
we
must
surrender
exclaimed
jerry
then
death
alive
for
what
answered
i
modesty
would
prevent
me
from
sleeping
before
so
many
men
cried
he
as
i
do
have
too
much
modesty
to
shew
your
modesty
sleep
by
my
soul
you
shall
sleep
and
snore
too
if
you
have
a
mind
sleep
sure
ca
you
pin
the
curtains
round
so
that
we
sha
see
you
sleep
sure
how
did
the
ladies
manage
on
board
the
packet
that
i
came
over
in
sleep
sleep
sleep
o
murder
i
believe
we
must
surrender
sure
enough
o
murder
murder
is
all
over
with
us
for
now
that
i
think
of
it
we
sha
have
even
room
to
lie
down
you
know
is
a
sad
affair
said
i
to
the
minstrel

the
minstrel
blushing
through
his
very
eyeballs
cried
betterton

returned
to

army
for
the
purpose
of
announcing
the
peace
i
fixed
with
jerry
to
meet
him
in
london
at
the
expiration
of
hours
i
now
perceived
susan
running
towards
the
castle
with
all
her
men
and
as
soon
as
she
got
under
the
walls
she
cried
peace
no
peace
but
bloody
bloody
war
come
down
here
you
wretch
with
the
steel
bonnet
till
i
tear
your
eyes
out
you
special
babe
of
hell
that
robbed
me
of
the
only
friend
i
had
on
earth
and
she
ran
on
with
the
most
horrible
imprecations
and
vows
of
vengeance
and
is
that
susy
cried
one
of
my
men
leaning
over
the
battlements
exclaimed
she
patrick
patrick

you
so
faithless
as
to
be
taking
part
with
my
mortal
enemy

taking
part
with
my

patrick

just
made
a

and
i
will
do
whatever
you
desire
i
desires
you
to
go
back
this
moment
said
patrick
susan
retired
to
the
main
body
without
uttering
a
word
the
several
articles
were
then
executed
in
due
form
the
prisoners
were
liberated
the
soldiers
on
both
sides
laid
down
their
arms
i
distributed
all
my
remaining
money
amongst
my
men
they
thanked
me
with
a
shout
and
then
headed
by
the
warden
issued
from
the
castle
at
the
same
time
betterton
and
his
party
marched
off
the
field
when
jerry
had
got
almost
out
of
sight
he
halted
his
men
faced
them
towards
the
castle
and
all
gave
three
last
cheers
i
waved
my
handkerchief
and
cried
like
a
child
i
then
took
a
tender
leave
of
my
dear
black
chamber
and
with
a
heavy
heart
and
a
tardy
step
departed
from
my
castle
till
better
days
should
enable
me
to
revisit
it
i
proceeded
with
the
minstrel
to
the
poor
woman
cottage
whence
i
now
write
and
i
have
just
dispatched
him
for
a
chaise
as
i
shall
return
to
london
immediately
my

is
almost
broken
adieu

o

you
reveal
the
story
of
my
wrongs
and
ask
you

vain
hope
yet
it
imparts
some
comfort
to
believe
that
what

now
write
may
one
day
meet
the
eye
of
a
that
the
words
which
tell
my
sufferings
may
one
day
draw
pity
from
the
feeling
heart
know
then
that
on
the
night
of
the
fatal
day
which
saw
me
driven
from
my
castle
by
ruthless
foes
four
men
in
black
visages
rushed
into
the
cottage
where
i
had
taken
shelter
bore
me
from
it
and
forced
me
and
my
minstrel
into
a
carriage
we
travelled
miles
in
impenetrable
silence
at
length
they
stopped
cast
a
cloak
over
my
face
and
carried
me
in
their
arms
along
winding
passages
and
up
and
down
flights
of
steps
they
then
took
off
the
cloak
and
i
found
myself
in
an
antique
and
gothic
apartment
my
conductors
laid
down
a
lamp
and
disappeared
i
heard
the
door
barred
upon
me
o
sound
of
despair
o
moment
of
unutterable
anguish
shut
out
from
day
from
friends
from
life
in
the
prime
of
my
years
in
the
height
of
my
transgressions
i
sink
under
the
almost
an
hour
has
now
passed
in
solitude
and
silence
why
am
i
brought
hither
why
confined
thus
rigorously
the
horrors
of
death
are
before
my
eyes
o
dire
extremity
o
state
of
living
death
is
this
a
vision
are
these
things
real
alas
i
am
bewildered
such
biddy
was
the
manuscript
that
i
scribbled
last
night
after
the
mysterious
event
which
it
relates
you
shall
now
hear
the
particulars
of
all
that
has
occurred
to
me
since
after
the
ruffians
had
departed
and
i
had
rallied
my
spirits
i
took
up
the
lamp
and
began
examining
the
chamber
it
was
spacious
and
the
feeble
light
that
i
carried
could
but
just
penetrate
it
part
of
the
walls
were
hidden
with
historical
arras
worked
in
colourless
and
rotten
worsted
which
depicted
scenes
from
the
provençal
romances
the
deeds
of
charlemagne
and
his
twelve
peers
the
crusaders
troubadours
and
saracens
and
the
necromantic
feats
of
the
magician
jurl
the
walls
were
wainscotted
with
black
larchwood
and
over
the
painted
and
escutcheoned
windows
hung
iron
visors
tattered
pennons
and
broken
shields
an
antique
bed
of
decayed
damask
with
a
lofty
tester
stood
in
a
corner
and
a
few
grand
chairs
tissued
and
fringed
with
threads
of
tarnished
gold
were
round
the
room
at
the
farther
end
a
picture
of
a
soldier
on
horseback
darting
his
spear
upon
a
man
who
held
up
his
hands
in
a
supplicating
attitude
was
enclosed
in
a
frame
of
uncommon
size
that
reached
down
to
the
ground
an
old
harp
which
occupied
one
corner
proved
imprisonment
and
some
clots
of
blood
upon
the
floor
proved
murder
i
gazed
with
delight
at
this
admirable
apartment
it
was
a
perfect
treasure
nothing
could
be
more
complete
all
was
in
the
best
style
of
horror
and
now
for
the
first
time
i
felt
the
full
consciousness
of
being
as
real
a
heroine
as
ever
existed
i
then
indulged
myself
with
imagining
the
frightful
scenes
i
should
undergo
here
such
attempts
to
murder
me
such
ghosts
such
mysteries
figures
flitting
in
the
dusty
perspective
quick
steps
along
the
corridor
groans
and
an
lord
of
the
castle
in
the
midst
of
this
pleasing
reverie
methought
i
heard
a
step
approaching
it
stopped
at
the
door
the
bolts
were
undrawn
and
an
antiquated
in
fardingale
ruffles
flounces
and
flowered
silk
bustled
into
the
room
lord
said
she
me
to
let
your
ladyship
know
that
he
will
do
himself
the
honour
of
waiting
on
you
in
your
lord
said
i
i
shall
be
ready
to
receive
him
but
pray
my
good
woman
said
i
is
the
name
of
your
lord
woman
cried
she
bridling
up
more
good
woman
than
yourself
dame
ursulina
if
you
please
then
dame
ursulina
what
is
his
name
baron
hildebrand
answered
she
only
feudal
chieftain
left
in
england
what
is
the
name
of
his
castle
answered
she
it
is
situated
in
the
black
forest
of
grodolphon
whose
oaks
are
coeval
with
the
reign
of
brute
alas
cried
i
have
i
been
seized
why
thus
imprisoned
why
the
dame
laid
her
finger
across
her
lips
and
grinned
volumes
of
mystery
least
tell
me
said
i
with
a
searching
look
comes
that
blood
on
the
floor
for
it
appears
but
just
spilt
cried
she
blood
is
there
these
fifty
years
sure
your
ladyship
has
often
read
in
romances
of
blood
on
floors
and
daggers
that
looked
as
fresh
as
a
daisy
at
the
end
of
centuries
but
modern
blood
wo
keep
like
the
good
old
blood
ay
ay
ay
the
times
have
degenerated
in
every
thing
even
in
harps
look
at
that
harp
yonder
i
warrant
is
in
excellent
tune
at
this
moment
albeit
no
human
finger
has
touched
it
these
ten
years
and
your
ladyship
must
remember
reading
of
other
cobwebbed
harps
in
old
castles
that
required
no
after
lying
by
whole
ages
but
indeed
they
do
say
that
the
ghost
keeps
this
harp
in
order
by
playing
on
it
o
nights
ghost
exclaimed
i
by
my
fackins
said
she
this
is
the
haunted
chamber
of
the
northern
tower
and
such
sights
and
noises
santa
catharina
of
sienna
and
bridget
and
san
pietro
and
santa
benedicta
and
radagunda
defend
me
then
aspirating
an
ejaculation
she
hastily
hobbled
out
of
the
room
and
locked
the
door
after
her
without
giving
me
farther
satisfaction
however
the
visit
from
baron
hildebrand
occupied
my
mind
more
than
the
ghost
and
i
sat
expecting
it
with
great
anxiety
at
last
i
heard
a
heavy
tread
along
the
corridor
the
door
was
unbarred
and
a
huge
but
majestic
figure
strode
into
the
chamber
the
black
plume
towering
on
his
cap
the
armorial
coat
persian
sash
and
spanish
cloak
conspiring
with
the
most
muscular
frown
imaginable
made
him
look
truly
tremendous
as
he
flung
himself
into
a
chair
he
cast
a
schedoniac
scowl
at
me
while
i
felt
that
one
glance
from
the
corner
of
a
villain
eye
is
worth
twenty
looks
from
an
honest
man
my
heart
throbbed
audible
my
bosom
heaved
like
billows
i
threw
into
my
features
a
conventual
smile
and
stood
before
him
in
all
the
silence
of
despair
something
between
niobe
patience
and
a
broken
lily
cried
he
with
a
voice
that
vibrated
through
my
brain
am
the
baron
hildebrand
that
celebrated
ruffian
my
plans
are
terrible
and
unsearchable
hear
me
daughter
the
lady
sympathina
though
long
betrothed
to
the
marquis
de
furioso
has
long
been
enamoured
of
the
lord
montmorenci
in
vain
have
i
tried
entreaties
and
imprecations
nothing
will
induce
her
to
relinquish
him
even
though
he
has
himself
confessed
to
her
that
you
reign
sole
tormentress
of
his
heart
doubtful
what
course
to
take
i
heard
from
my
vassals
of
your
having
seized
on
a
neighbouring
castle
and
of
montmorenci
being
there
with
you
the
moment
was
too
precious
to
be
lost
i
planted
armed
spies
about
the
castle
with
orders
to
make
you
and
him
prisoners
the
first
opportunity
these
orders
are
executed
and
his
lordship
is
a
captive
in
the
western
turret
madam
you
must
already
guess
my
motive
for
having
taken
this
step
it
is
to
secure
your
immediate
marriage
with
his
lordship
and
thus
to
terminate
for
ever
my
daughter
hopes
and
my
own
inquietude
in
two
days
therefore
be
prepared
to
give
him
your
hand
or
to
suffer
imprisonment
for
life
lord
said
i
am
a
poor
weak
timid
girl
but
yet
not
unmindful
of
my
noble
lineage
i
can
not
consent
to
disgrace
it
my
lord
i
will
not
wed
montmorenci
will
not
cried
he
starting
from
his
seat
will
not
said
i
in
a
tone
of
the
sweetest
obstinacy
exclaimed
he
and
began
to
pace
the
chamber
with
prodigious
strides
conceive
the
scene
the
tall
figure
of
hildebrand
passing
along
with
folded
arms
the
hideous
desolation
of
the
room
and
my
shrinking
figure
it
was
great
very
great
it
resembled
a
pandemonium
where
an
angel
of
light
was
tormented
by
a
fiend
yet
insult
and
oppression
had
but
added
to
my
charms
as
the
rose
throws
forth
fresh
fragrance
by
being
mutilated
on
a
sudden
he
stopped
short
before
me
is
your
reason
for
refusing
to
marry
him
said
he
lord
answered
i
do
not
feel
for
his
lordship
the
passion
of
love
cried
he
with
yells
of
laughter
this
is
silly
rhodomontade
love
there
is
no
such
passion
but
mark
me
madam
soon
shall
you
learn
that
there
is
such
a
passion
as
revenge
and
with
these
words
he
rushed
out
of
the
chamber
nothing
could
be
better
than
my
conduct
on
this
occasion
i
was
delighted
with
it
and
with
the
castle
and
with
every
thing
i
therefore
knelt
and
chaunted
a
vesper
hymn
so
soft
and
so
solemn
while
my
eyes
like
a
magdalen
were
cast
to
the
planets
adieu
letter
xli
i
had
flung
myself
on
the
bed
my
lamp
was
extinguished
and
now
sleep
began
to
pour
its
opiate
over
me
when
terrible
to
tell
methought
i
heard
steps
stealing
through
my
very
chamber
sleeps
whispered
a
voice
poniard
her
at
once
said
another
i
must
have
five
ducats
said
the
first
said
the
second
the
tormentor
of
innocents
would
charge
but
two
i
will
betray
the
murder
will
take
good
care
you
shall
not
so
will
assassinate
you
after
it
is
prudent
however
but
by
jago
i
will
not
consent
to
be
assassinated
under
a
ducat
to
my
children
you
shall
have
them
maestro
mio
illustrissimo
the
bravo
abellino
is
your
povero
devotissimo
the
next
instant
my
strained
eyeballs
saw
a
figure
half
starting
from
behind
the
tattered
arras
in
a
long
cloak
and
flat
cap
his
right
hand
held
a
dagger
and
his
left
a
dark
lantern
that
cast
a
yellow
glare
on
the
ruffianly
sculpture
of
his
visage
i
screamed
but
sorry
am
i
to
say
less
like
a
heroine
than
a
and
the
bravo
advanced
on
a
sudden
the
door
of
the
chamber
was
burst
open
and
montmorenci
rushed
forward
with
a
brandished
sword
at
the
same
moment
baron
hildebrand
sprang
from
behind
the
tapestry
villain
cried
montmorenci
and
a
desperate
battle
began
my
life
was
the
stake
i
hung
upon
every
blow
winced
as
the
steel
descended
on
montmorenci
and
moved
as
he
moved
with
agonised
mimicry
at
length
victory
declared
in
his
favour
the
bandit
lay
lifeless
and
the
baron
was
disarmed
but
escaped
out
of
the
chamber

cried
my
preserver
snatching
me
to
his
heart
have
bribed
a
a
horse

in
let
us
fly

let
us
said
i
disengaging
myself
hold
cried
he
have
saved
your
life
save
mine
by
consenting
to
an
immediate
union
my
lord
can
not
can
not
my
lord
do
come
my
knees
lady
the
villain
and
immure
him
in
the
deepest
dungeon
exclaimed
the
baron
rushing
into
the
room
with
his
domestics
some
of
them
laid
hold
on
montmorenci
the
rest
bore
off
the
body
of
the
bandit
the
baron
and
i
were
left
alone

i
flinging
myself
at
his
feet
for
alas
i
had
now
lost
all
my
magnanimity
man
is
my
horror
and
detestation
but
only
promise
to
spare
my
life
for
one
day
more
and
indeed
indeed
i
will
try
if
i
can
make
up
my
mind
to
marry
him
well
said
the
baron
you
sleep
secure
decides
your
fate
he
spoke
and
stalked
out
of
the
chamber
this
horrid
castle
would
i
had
never
set
foot
in
it
i
will
escape
if
i
can
i
am
resolved
i
have
already
tried
the
walls
for
a
sliding
pannel
or
a
concealed
door
but
nothing
of
the
kind
can
i
discover
and
yet
something
of
the
kind
there
must
be
else
how
could
the
baron
and
bravo
have
entered
my
chamber
i
protest
this
facility
of
intrusion
in
antique
apartments
is
extremely
distressing
for
besides
its
exposing
one
to
be
murdered
just
think
how
it
exposes
one
to
be
peeped
at
i
declare
i
dare
not
even
undress
lest
some
menial
should
be
leering
through
a
secret
crevice
oh
that
i
were
once
more
in
the
mud
cottage
i
am
sick
of
castles
adieu

this
morning
after

a
fluster
hammering

paddling

manner
of
possets
to
make
much
of
the
fine
company
that
is
coming
down
to
the
baron
exclaimed
i
will
my
troubles
cease
doubtless
they
are
a
most
dissolute
set
an
amorous
verezzi
an
insinuating
cavigni
and
an
abandoned
orsino
besides
some
lovely
voluptuary
some
fascinating
desperado
who
plays
the
harp
and
poisons
by
the
hour
not
at
all
said
the
dame

none
but

such
tickling
and
pinching
and
fircumdandying
and
cherrybrandying
and
the
genteel
poison
of

and
the
warder
blowing
his
horn
and
the
baron
in
his
scowered
armour
and

muttered
she

and
she
flounced
out
of
the
room
i
sat
down
to
breakfast
astonished
at
what
i
had
just
heard
harriet
byron
cecilia
amanda
and
their
respective
consorts
all
alive
and
well
oh
could
i
get
but
one
glimpse
of
them
speak
ten
words
with
them
i
should
die
content
i
pictured
them
to
myself
adorned
with
all
the
venerable
loveliness
of
a
virtuous
old
age
even
in
greyness
engaging
even
in
wrinkles
interesting
hand
in
hand
they
walk
down
the
gentle
slope
of
life
and
often
pause
to
look
back
upon
the
scenes
that
they
have
passed
the
happy
vale
of
their
childhood
the
turretted
castle
the
cloistered
monastery
this
reverie
was
interrupted
by
the
return
of
dame
ursulina
baron
said
she
just
gone
off
to
london
we
think
either
for
the
purpose
of
consulting
physicians
about
his
periodical
madness
or
of
advising
government
to
propose
a
peace
with
france
so
my
young
mistress
the
lady
sympathina
is
anxious
to
visit
you
during
his
absence
as
he
prohibited
her
and
she
has
sent
me
to
request
that
you
will
honor
her
with
your
permission
her
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
see
and
to
solace
a
lady
of
her
miseries
answered
i
i
trust
we
shall
swear
an
eternal
friendship
when
we
meet
said
the
dame
the
soft
soother
of
human
cares
o
to
see
two
fair
females
sobbing
respondent
while
their
blue
eyes
shine
through
their
tears
like
hyacinths
bathed
in
the
dews
of
the
morning
dame
cried
i
did
you
manage
to
pick
up
such
a
charming
sentiment
and
such
elegant
language
come
up
said
she
hav
lived
not
i
not
with
heroines
not
for
nothing
marry
come
up
quotha
and
this
frumpish
old
woman
sailed
out
of
the
chamber
in
a
great
fume
i
now
prepared
for
an
interview
of
congenial
souls
not
was
i
long
kept
in
suspense
hardly
had
the
dame
disappeared
when
the
door
opened
again
and
a
tall
thin
lovely
girl
flew
into
the
room
she
stopped
opposite
me
her
yellow
ringlets
hung
round
her
pale
face
like
a
mist
round
the
moon
again
she
advanced
took
both
my
hands
and
stood
gazing
on
my

subsided

i

i
this
that

part

all
the
requisite
qualities

expected

i
said
she
is
my
chief
beauty
i
blush
one
tint
and
with
joy
two
tints
including
forehead
and
bosom
with
modesty
and
four
with
love
to
the
points
of
my
fingers
my
father
once
blushed
me
against
the
dawn
for
a
tattered
banner
to
a
rusty
poniard
who
won
said
i
was
play
or
pay
replied
she
the
morning
happened
to
be
misty
so
there
was
no
sport
in
that
way
but
i
fainted
which
was
just
as
good
if
not
better
are
you
much
addicted
to
fainting
little
said
i
honor
to
be
honest
with
you
i
am
afraid
i
have
never
fainted
yet
but
at
a
proper
opportunity
i
flatter
myself
love
said
she
not
be
distressed
about
the
matter
if
you
weep
well
is
a
good
substitute
do
you
weep
well
well
indeed
said
i
then
cried
she
will
weep
on
each
other
necks
and
she
flung
her
arms
about
me
we
remained
some
moments
in
motionless
endearment
you
weeping
said
she
at
length
answered
i
why
do
you
said
she
ca
said
i
ca
do
said
she
my
word
i
ca
said
i
i
am
trying
all
i
can
but
bless
me
how
desperately
you
are
crying
your
tears
are
running
down
my
bosom
like
a
torrent
and
boiling
hot
too
excuse
me
but
you
will
give
me
my
death
of
cold
my
fondling
said
she
raising
herself
from
my
neck
are
my
sole
consolation
ofttimes
i
sit
and
weep
i
know
not
why
and
then
i
weep
to
find
myself
weeping
then
when
i
can
weep
i
weep
at
having
nothing
to
weep
at
and
then
when
i
have
something
to
weep
at
i
weep
that
i
can
not
weep
at
it
this
very
morning
i
bumpered
a
tulip
with
my
tears
while
reading
a
dainty
ditty
that
i
must
now
repeat
to
you
moon
had
just
risen
as
a
maid
parted
from
her
lover
a
sylph
was
pursuing
her
sigh
through
the
deserts
of
air
bathing
in
its
warmth
and
enhaling
its
odours
as
he
flew
over
the
ocean
he
saw
a
sitting
on
the
shore
and
singing
the
fate
of
a
shipwreck
that
appeared
at
a
distance
with
broken
masts
and
floating
rudder
her
instrument
was
her
own
long
and
blue
tresses
which
she
had
strung
across
rocks
of
coral
the
sparkling
spray
struck
them
and
made
sweet
music
he
saw
he
loved
he
hovered
over
her
but
invisible
how
could
he
attract
her
eyes
incorporeal
how
could
he
touch
her
even
his
voice
could
not
be
heard
by
her
amidst
the
dashing
of
the
waves
and
the
melody
of
her
ringlets
the
sylphs
pitying
his
miserable
state
exiled
him
to
a
bower
of
woodbine
there
he
sits
dips
his
pen
of
moonshine
in
the
subtle
dew
ere
it
falls
and
writes
his
love
on
the
bell
of
a
silver
this
charming
tale
led
us
to
talk
of
moonshine
we
moralized
on
the
uncertainty
of
it
and
of
life
discussed
sighs
and
agreed
that
they
were
charming
things
enumerated
the
various
kinds
of
tresses
flaxen
golden
chesnut
amber
sunny
jetty
carroty
and
i
suggested
two
new
epithets
sorrel
hair
and
narcissine
hair
such
a
flow
of
soul
never
was
at
last
she
rose
to
depart
my
love
said
she
am
in
momentary
expectation
of
sir
charles
grandison
mortimer
delville
and
lord
mortimer
with
their
amiable
wives
will
you
permit
them
during
the
baron
absence
to
spend
an
hour
with
you
this
evening
they
will
not
betray
us
i
shall
be
proud
of
showing
you
to
them
and
you
will
receive
much
delight
and
edification
from
their
society
i
grasped
at
the
proposal
with
eagerness
she
flitted
out
of
the
chamber
with
a
promissory
smile
and
i
was
so
charmed
that
i
began
frisking
about
and
snapping
my
fingers
in
a
most
indecorous
manner
what
an
angel
is
this
sympathina
her
face
has
the
contour
of
a
madona
with
the
sensibility
of
a
magdalen
her
voice
is
soft
as
the
last
accents
of
a
dying
maid
her
language
is
engaging
her
oh
is
sublime
and
her
ah
is
beautiful
adieu
letter
xliii
towards
night
i
heard
the
sound
of
several
steps
approaching
the
chamber
the
bolts
were
undrawn
and
lady
sympathina
at
the
head
of
the
company
entered
and
announced
their
names
me
said
i
involuntarily
for
such
a
set
of
objects
never
were
seen
sir
charles
grandison
came
forward
the
first
he
was
an
emaciated
old
oddity
in
flannels
and
a
flowing
wig
he
bowed
over
my
hand
and
kissed
it
his
old
custom
you
know
lady
grandison
leaned
on
his
arm
bursting
with
fat
and
laughter
and
so
unlike
what
i
had
conceived
of
harriet
byron
that
i
turned
from
her
in
disgust
mortimer
delville
came
next
and
my
disappointment
at
finding
him
a
plain
sturdy
fellow
was
soon
absorbed
in
my
still
greater
regret
at
seeing
his
cecilia
once
the
cecilia
now
flaunting
in
all
the
reverend
graces
of
a
painted
grandmother
and
leering
most
roguishly
after
them
lord
mortimer
and
his
amanda
advanced
but
he
had
fallen
into
flesh
and
she
with
a
face
like
scorched
parchment
appeared
both
and
such
a
perpetual
sighing
and
wheezing
did
she
keep
i
was
too
much
shocked
and
disappointed
to
speak
but
sir
charles
soon
broke
silence
and
after
the
most
tedious
sentence
of
compliment
that
i
had
ever
heard
he
thus
continued
ladyship
may
recollect
i
have
always
been
celebrated
for
giving
advice
let
me
then
advise
you
to
relieve
yourself
from
your
present
embarrassment
by
marrying
lord
montmorenci
it
seems
you
do
not
love
him
for
that
very
reason
marry
him
trust
me
love
before
marriage
is
the
surest
preventive
of
love
after
it
heroes
and
heroines
exemplify
the
proposition
why
do
their
biographers
always
conclude
the
book
just
at
their
wedding
simply
because
all
beyond
it
is
unhappiness
and
hatred
sir
charles
said
i
must
be
mistaken
their
biographers
who
have
such
admirable
information
that
they
can
even
tell
the
thoughts
and
actions
of
dying
personages
when
not
a
soul
is
near
them
these
always
end
the
book
with
declaring
that
the
connubial
lives
of
their
heroes
and
heroines
are
like
unclouded
skies
or
unruffled
streams
or
summer
all
the
year
through
or
some
gentle
simile
or
other
is
all
irony
replied
sir
charles
i
know
most
of
these
heroes
and
heroines
myself
and
i
know
that
nothing
can
equal
their
misery
you
know
lord
orville
and
his
evelina
said
i
are
not
they
happy
cried
he
laughing
you
really
never
heard
of
their
notorious
miffs
why
it
was
but
yesterday
that
she
flogged
him
with
a
boiled
leg
of
mutton
because
he
had
sent
home
no
turnips
exclaimed
i
she
when
a
girl
so
meek
there
it
is
said
he
has
never
seen
a
white
foal
or
a
cross
girl
but
often
white
horses
and
cross
wives
let
me
advise
you
against
white
horses
pray
said
i
addressing
amanda
not
your
brother
oscar
happy
with
his
adela
no
cried
she
became
infatuated
with
the
charms
of
evelina
old
governess
madam
duval
so
poor
adela
absconded
and
she
who
was
once
the
soul
of
mirth
has
now
grown
a
confirmed
methodist
curls
a
sacred
sneer
at
gaiety
loves
canting
and
decanting
piety
and
de
in
short
the
devil
is
very
busy
about
her
though
she
sometimes
drives
him
away
with
a
thump
of
the
bible
rosa
the
gentle
what
of
her
said
i
with
one
corporal
trim
answered
sir
charles
shocking
cried
i
pamela
the
virtuous
pamela
somewhat
a
better
choice
said
sir
charles
she
ran
off
with
rasselas
prince
of
abyssinia
when
he
returned
to
the
happy
valley
accounts
indeed
said
i
dreadful
said
sir
charles
bowing
over
my
hand
i
trust
they
will
determine
you
to
marry
montmorenci
is
true
he
has
lost
two
teeth
and
you
do
not
love
him
but
was
not
walstein
a
cripple
and
did
not
caroline
of
lichfield
fall
in
love
with
him
after
their
marriage
though
she
had
hated
him
before
it
cried

old
lord

of
the
tremendous
spectre
that
haunts
this
apartment
cried
lady
grandison
above
all
cried
the
lady
sympathina
in
mind
that
this
chamber
may
be
the
means
of
your
waking
some
morning
with
a
face
like
a
pumpkin
exclaimed
i
do
you
mean
my
face
like
a
pumpkin
said
she
dampness
of
the
room
would
swell
it
up
like
a
pumpkin
in
a
single
night
ladies
and
gentlemen
cried
i
dropping
on
my
knees
see
what
shocking
horrors
surround
me
here
oh
let
me
beseech
of
you
to
pity
and
to
rescue
me
surely
surely
you
might
aid
me
in
escaping
is
out
of
the
nature
of
possibilities
said
lady
sympathina
least
then
cried
i
might
use
your
influence
to
have
me
removed
from
this
vile
room
that
feels
like
a
well
cried
dame
ursulina
running
in
breathless
baron
has
just
returned
and
is
searching
for
you
all
and
he
has
already
been
through
the
chapel
and
armoury
and
gallery
and
the
west
tower
and
east
tower
and
south
tower
and
the
cedar
chamber
and
oaken
chamber
and
black
chamber
and
grey
brown
yellow
green
pale
pink
sky
blue
and
every
shade
tinge
and
tint
of
chamber
in
the
whole
castle
benedicite
santa
maria
how
the
times
have
degenerated
come
come
come
the
guests
vanished
the
door
was
barred
and
i
remained
alone
i
sat
ruminating
in
sad
earnest
on
the
necessity
for
my
consenting
to
this
hateful
match
when
and
i
protest
to
you
i
had
not
thought
it
was
more
than
nine
a
terrible
bell
which
i
never
heard
before
tolled
with
an
appalling
reverberation
that
rang
through
my
whole
frame
the
frightful
hour
of
one
at
the
same
moment
i
heard
a
noise
and
looking
towards
the
opposite
end
of
the
chamber
i
beheld
the
great
picture
on
a
sudden
disappear
and
standing
in
its
stead
a
tall
figure
cased
in
steel
and
with
a
spectral
visage
the
perfect
counterpart
of
the
baron
i
sat
gasping
it
uttered
these
sepulchral
intonations
am
the
spirit
of
the
murdered
alphonso
lord
montmorenci
deserves
thee
wed
him
or
in
two
days
thou
liest
a
corpse
night
i
come
the
superhuman
appearance
spoke
and
oh
soothing
sound
uttered
a
human
sneeze
it
muttered
is
blown
and
immediately
the
picture
flew
back
to
its
place
well
i
had
never
heard
of
a
ghost
sneezing
before
so
you
may
judge
i
soon
got
rid
of
my
terror
and
felt
pretty
certain
that
this
was
no
bloodless
and
marrowless
apparition
but
the
baron
himself
who
had
adopted
the
ghosting
system
so
common
in
romances
for
the
purpose
of
frightening
me
into
his
schemes
however
i
had
now
discovered
a
concealed
door
and
with
it
a
chance
of
escape
i
must
tell
you
that
escape
by
the
public
door
is
utterly
impracticable
as
a
maid
always
opens
it
for
those
that
enter
and
remains
outside
till
they
return
however
i
have
a
plan
about
the
private
door
which
if
the
ghost
should
appear
again
as
it
promised
is
likely
to
succeed
i
was
pondering
upon
this
plan
when
in
came
dame
ursulina
taking
snuff
and
sneezing
at
a
furious
rate
the
mass
said
she
rejoiceth
the
old
cockles
of
my
heart
to
see
your
ladyship
safe
for
as
i
passed
your
door
just
now
methought
i
heard
the
ghost
might
well
have
heard
it
said
i
pretending
infinite
faintness
i
have
seen
it
and
it
entered
through
yonder
picture
cried
she
it
was
a
true
spectre
real
downright
apparition
said
i
with
the
smallest
mixture
of
mortality
did
your
ladyship
hear
me
sneeze
at
the
door
said
she
was
too
much
alarmed
to
hear
anything
answered
i
pray
have
the
goodness
to
lend
me
that
as
a
pinch
or
two
may
revive
me
from
my
faintness
i
had
my
reasons
for
this
request
heroine
take
snuff
cried
she
laying
the
box
on
the
table
how
the
times
are
changed
but
now
my
lady
do
be
trying
to
move
or
cut
that
great
picture
for
though
the
ghost
comes
into
the
chamber
through
it
no
mortal
can
i
know
better
than
to
let
you
give
me
the
slip
and
i
will
tell
a
story
to
prove
my
knowledge
of
bolts
and
bars
when
i
was
a
girl
a
young
man
lodged
in
the
house
and
one
night
he
stole
the
stick
that
i
used
to
fasten
the
hasp
and
staple
of
my
door
with
well
my
mother
bade
me
put
a
carrot
as
there
was
nothing
else
in
its
place
so
i
put
in
a
carrot
for
i
was
a
dutiful
daughter
but
i
put
in
a
boiled
carrot
for
i
was
a
maiden
eh
do
i
understand
the
doctrine
of
bolts
and
bars
understand
a
great
deal
too
much
said
i
as
the
withered
wanton
went
chuckling
out
of
the
chamber
i
must
now
retire
to
rest
i
do
not
fear
being
disturbed
by
a
bravo
but
i
am
uneasy
lest
i
should
wake
in
the
morning
with
a
face
like
a
pumpkin
adieu
letter
xliv
about
noon
the
baron
hildebrand
paid
me
a
visit
to
hear
as
he
said
my
final
determination
respecting
my
marriage
with
montmorenci
i
had
prepared
my
lesson
and
i
told
him
that
my
mind
was
not
yet
entirely
reconciled
to
such
an
event
but
that
it
was
much
swayed
by
a
most
extraordinary
circumstance
which
had
occurred
the
night
before
he
desired
me
to
relate
it
and
i
then
with
apparent
agitation
recounted
the
particulars
of
the
apparition
and
declared
that
if
it
should
come
again
i
would
endeavour
to
preserve
my
presence
of
mind
and
enter
into
conversation
with
it
in
order
as
it
appeared
quite
well
informed
of
the
picture
to
learn
whether
my
marriage
with
his
lordship
would
prove
fortunate
or
otherwise
i
then
added
that
if
its
answer
should
be
favourable
i
would
not
hesitate
another
moment
to
give
him
my
hand
the
baron
while
he
could
not
suppress
a
smile
protested
himself
highly
delighted
with
my
determination
of
speaking
to
the
spectre
and
encouraged
me
not
to
fear
it
as
it
was
the
most
harmless
creature
of
its
kind
ever
known
he
then
took
his
leave
i
spent
the
remainder
of
the
day
reflecting
on
the
desperate
enterprise
that
i
had
planned
for
the
night
and
fortifying
my
mind
by
recalling
all
the
hazardous
escapes
of
other
heroines
at
last
the
momentous
hour
was
at
hand
the
lamp
and
lay
on
the
table
i
sat
anxious
and
kept
a
watchful
eye
upon
the
picture
the
bell
tolled
one
again
the
picture
vanished
and
again
the
spectre
stood
there
its
left
thumb
rested
upon
its
hip
and
its
right
hand
was
held
to
the
heavens
i
sent
forth
a
shriek
and
hid
my
face
in
my
hands
while
it
spoke
these
words
come
to
thee
for
the
last
time
wilt
thou
wed
montmorenci
or
wilt
thou
not
cried
i
you
would
only
promise
not
to
do
me
a
mischief
i
have
something
particular
to
ask
of
you
spirit
can
not
harm
a
mortal
drawled
out
the
spectre
then
said
i
faltering
and
pardon
me
perhaps
you
would
first
have
the
goodness
to
walk
in
the
spectre
advanced
a
few
paces
and
paused
is
so
kind
so
condescending
said
i
really
do
take
a
chair
the
spectre
shook
its
head
mournfully
do
said
i
will
oblige
me
the
spectre
seated
itself
in
a
chair
but
atoned
for
the
mortal
act
by
an
immortal
majesty
of
manner
you
are
of
another
world
said
i
but
fair
to
do
the
honours
of
this
and
in
truth
i
am
not
at
all
astonished
that
you
apparitions
should
speak
so
harshly
as
you
usually
do
we
mortals
always
shew
such
evident
aversion
and
horror
at
your
appearance
is
a
prejudice
gone
forth
against
us
said
the
spectre
with
a
hollow
voice
consequence
of
our
coming
at
night
like
thieves
said
i
one
precisely
and
it
has
often
struck
me
how
well
the
clocks
of
old
castles
were
kept
for
they
regularly
struck
just
as
the
ghost
appeared
indeed
ghosts
keep
such
late
hours
that
is
no
wonder
they
look
pale
and
thin
i
do
not
recollect
ever
to
have
heard
or
read
of
a
fat
or
a
phantom
of
a
ghost
wanting
a
limb
or
an
eye
said
the
spectre
of
an
ugly
ghost
said
i
bowing
the
spectre
took
the
compliment
and
bowed
in
return
therefore
said
the
spectre
spirits
are
always
accurate
resemblances
of
the
bodies
that
they
once
inhabited
none
but
thin
and
pale
persons
can
ever
become
ghosts
by
the
same
rule
said
i
but
and
persons
can
go
to
heaven
for
our
painters
always
represent
angels
so
i
have
never
heard
of
a
angel
or
a
cherub
know
said
the
spectre
angels
are
as
painters
depict
them
always
sitting
naked
on
cold
clouds
i
would
rather
live
the
life
of
a
ghost
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
pray
cried
i
and
how
do
ghosts
live
this
very
globe
said
the
spectre
this
globe
is
not
as
most
mortals
imagine
a
solid
body
but
a
round
crust
about
ten
miles
thick
and
the
concave
inside
is
furnished
just
like
the
convex
outside
with
wood
water
vale
and
mountain
in
the
centre
stands
a
nice
little
golden
sun
about
the
size
of
a
pippin
and
lights
our
internal
world
where
whatever
enjoyments
we
loved
as
men
we
retain
as
ghosts
we
banquet
on
visionary
turtle
or
play
at
aërial
marbles
or
drive
a
phantasmagoric
four
in
hand
the
young
renew
their
amours
and
the
more
aged
sit
yawning
for
the
day
of
but
i
scent
the
rosy
air
of
dawn
speak
lady
what
question
art
thou
anxious
that
i
should
expound
said
i
i
marry
lord
montmorenci
i
shall
be
happy
with
him
or
not
as
eden
replied
the
spectre
lives
will
be
congenial
and
your
deaths
simultaneous
now
said
i
walking
closer
to
it
you
do
me
the
favour
to
take
a
pinch
of
snuff
it
cried
motioning
me
from
it
with
its
hand
but
quick
as
thought
i
flung
the
whole
contents
of
the
box
full
into
its
eyes
and
thunder
exclaimed
the
astonished
apparition
i
snatched
the
lamp
sprang
through
the
frame
of
the
picture
shut
the
concealed
door
bolted
it
while
all
the
time
i
heard
the
phantom
within
dancing
in
agony
at
its
eyes
and
sending
mine
to
as
many
devils
as
could
well
be
called
together
on
so
short
a
notice
thus
far
my
venturous
enterprise
had
prospered
i
now
found
myself
in
a
narrow
passage
with
another
door
at
the
farther
end
of
it
and
i
prepared
to
traverse
winding
stairs
subterranean
passages
and
suites
of
tapestried
apartments
i
therefore
advanced
and
opened
the
door
but
in
an
instant
started
back
for
i
had
beheld
a
lighted
hall
of
modern
architecture
with
gilded
balustrades
ceiling
painted
in
fresco
etruscan
lamps
and
yes
it
was
a
villa
or
a
casino
or
a
pallazo
or
any
thing
you
please
but
a
castello
amazement
horror
what
should
i
do
whither
turn
delay
would
be
fatal
again
i
peeped
the
hall
was
empty
so
putting
down
my
lamp
i
stole
across
it
to
an
open
door
and
looked
through
the
chink
i
had
just
time
to
see
a
persian
saloon
and
in
the
centre
a
table
laid
for
supper
when
i
heard
several
steps
entering
the
hall
it
was
too
late
to
retreat
so
i
sprang
into
the
room
and
recollecting
that
a
curtain
had
befriended
me
once
before
i
ran
behind
one
which
i
saw
there
instantly
afterwards
the
persons
entered
they
were
spruce
footmen
bringing
in
supper
not
a
scowl
not
a
mustachio
amongst
them
as
soon
as
the
covers
were
laid
a
crowd
of
company
came
laughing
into
the
room
but
friend
of
my
bosom
fancy
just
fancy
my
revulsion
of
soul
my
dismay
my
disgust
my
bitter
indignation
oh
how
shall
i
describe
to
you
half
what
i
felt
when
i
recognised
these
wretches
as
they
entered
one
by
one
to
be
the
identical
gang
who
had
visited
me
the
day
before
as
heroes
and
heroines
i
knew
them
instantly
though
they
looked
twice
as
young
and
in
the
midst
of
them
all
as
blithe
as
larks
came
betterton
himself
and
lord
altamont
mortimer
montmorenci
my
heart
died
at
the
sight
after
they
had
seated
themselves
betterton
who
sat
at
the
head
and
therefore
was
master
desired
one
of
the
servants
to
bring
in
crazed
poet
and
now
two
footmen
appeared
carrying
between
them
a
large
filled
with
higginson
which
they
placed
to
the
table
on
a
vacant
seat
the
bag
was
fastened
at
the
top
and
a
slit
was
on
the
side
of
it
the
wretches
then
began
to
banter
him
and
bade
him
put
forth
his
head
but
he
would
neither
move
nor
speak
at
last
they
turned
the
conversation
to
me
wonder
can
he
be
ghosting
her
all
this
time
said
betterton
cried
the
fellow
who
had
personated
sir
charles
grandison
ought
to
have
played
the
ghost
i
am
so
much
taller
than
he
unless
you
could
act
it
better
than
you
did
grandison
said
the
late
lady
sympathina
no
i
was
the
person
who
performed
my
part
well
pouring
a
vial
of
hot
water
down
her
neck
by
way
of
tears
and
frightening
her
out
of
her
senses
by
talking
of
a
face
like
a
pumpkin
cried
my
lord
montmorenci
best
piece
of
acting
you
ever
saw
was
when
i
first
met
her
at
the
theatre
and
persuaded
her
that
abraham
grundy
was
lord
altamont
mortimer
montmorenci
said
betterton
i
played
old
whylome
eftsoones
at
the
masquerade
and
made
her
believe
that
cherry
wilkinson
was
lady
cherubina
de
willoughby
i
turned
quite
sick
but
i
had
no
time
for
thought
the
thunderclaps
came
so
thick
upon
me
had
some
mad
notion
of
the
kind
before
said
grundy
i
have
done
with
calling
him
montmorenci
she
fancied
that
an
old
piece
of
parchment
part
of
a
lease
of
lives
was
an
irrefragable
proof
of
her
being
lady
de
willoughby
cried
betterton
of
poor
wilkinson
being
her
persecutor
instead
of
her
father
on
the
strength
of
which
vagary
he
lies
at
this
moment
in
a
madhouse
said
grundy
setting
up
for
a
heroine
and
her
affectation
while
imitating
the
manners
and
language
that
authors
chuse
to
give
their
heroines
would
make
a
tiger
laugh
i
vow
and
protest
our
amorous
interview
where
she
first
told
her
love
was
the
most
burlesque
exhibition
in
nature
i
am
thine
and
thou
art
mine
whimpered
the
silly
girl
sinking
on
my
bosom
she
now
says
she
does
not
love
me
do
believe
a
syllable
of
it
why
the
poor
creature
could
not
even
bridle
her
passion
in
my
presence
such
hugging
and
kissing
as
she
went
on
with
that
as
i
hope
to
be
saved
i
sometimes
thought
she
would
suffocate
me
outright
false
as
hell
cried
i
bursting
into
tears
and
running
from
behind
the
curtain
my
sacred
honour
ladies
and
gentlemen
is
every
word
of
it
a
vile
malicious
execrable
falsehood
oh
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
and
i
wrung
my
hands
with
agony
the
guests
had
risen
from
their
seats
in
amaze
and
i
now
made
a
spring
towards
the
door
but
was
intercepted
by
betterton
who
held
me
fast
the
name
of
wonder
cried
he
came
you
here
matter
cried
i
struggling
know
all
what
have
i
ever
done
to
you
you
base
you
cruel
people
yourself
cool
my
little
lady
said
he
wo
i
ca
cried
i
use
me
so
you
vile
set
you
horrid
horrid
set
for
another
said
he
to
the
servant
madam
you
shall
keep
company
with
the
bagged
poet
mercy
cried
i
will
no
one
help
me
will
if
i
can
exclaimed
higginson
with
his
head
thrust
out
of
the
bag
like
a
snail
and
down
he
slided
from
his
seat
and
began
rolling
and
tumbling
and
struggling
on
the
floor
till
he
got
upon
his
feet
and
then
he
came
jumping
towards
me
now
falling
now
rising
while
his
face
and
bald
forehead
were
all
over
meal
his
eyes
blaring
and
his
mouth
wide
open
the
company
wherever
he
moved
kept
in
a
circle
round
him
and
clapped
their
hands
and
shouted
as
i
stood
with
betterton
still
holding
me
fast
he
was
suddenly
flung
from
me
by
some
one
and
my
hand
seized
i
turned
and
beheld
stuart
bless
you
bless
you
cried
i
catching
his
arm
you
have
come
to
save
me
from
destruction
he
pressed
my
hand
and
pointing
to
betterton
and
grundy
who
stood
thunderstruck
cried
are
your
men
a
large
posse
of
constables
immediately
rushed
forward
and
arrested
them
what
is
all
this
cried
betterton
for
the
beating
you
gave
us
when
we
were
doing
our
duty
said
a
man
and
i
recognised
in
the
speaker
one
of
the
who
had
arrested
me
about
the
barouche
is
government
all
over
cried
betterton
is
the
minister
this
is
the
law
let
me
tell
you
sir
said
stuart
nothing
but
my
respect
for
the
law
deters
me
at
this
moment
from
chastising
you
as
you
deserve
do
you
mean
sirrah
cried
betterton
you
are
a
ruffian
said
stuart
the
same
cowardice
which
made
you
offer
insult
to
a
woman
will
make
you
bear
it
from
a
man
now
sir
i
leave
you
to
your
fate
and
we
were
quitting
the
room
thing
is
that
said
stuart
stopping
short
before
the
poet
who
with
one
arm
and
his
face
out
of
the
bag
lay
on
his
back
gasping
and
unable
to
stir
it
cut
it
cried
the
poor
man
in
choaking
accents
i
protest
exclaimed
stuart
as
he
snatched
a
knife
from
the
table
and
laid
open
the
bag
up
rose
the
poet
resurrectionary
from
his
hempen
coffin
and
was
beginning
to
clench
his
fist
but
stuart
caught
his
arm
and
hurried
him
and
me
out
of
the
room
stuart
with
great
eagerness
now
began
asking
me
the
particulars
of
all
that
had
occurred
at
betterton
and
his
rage
as
i
related
it
was
extreme
he
then
proceeded
to
tell
me
how
he
had
discovered
my
being
there
after
his
departure
from
lady
gwyn
he
set
off
for
london
to
prosecute
his
inquiries
about
my
father
and
spent
some
days
in
this
way
to
no
purpose
at
length
he
returned
to
lady
gwyn
but
was
much
shocked
at
learning
from
her
that
i
had
robbed
her
and
absconded
and
had
afterwards
made
an
assault
on
her
house
at
the
head
of
a
set
of
irishmen
by
the
description
she
gave
he
judged
that
jerry
sullivan
was
one
of
them
and
not
finding
us
at
monkton
castle
whither
she
directed
him
he
posted
back
to
london
in
order
to
make
inquiries
at
jerry
house
jerry
who
had
just
returned
related
the
whole
history
of
the
castle
adding
that
i
was
to
call
upon
him
the
moment
i
should
arrive
in
town
stuart
therefore
waited
some
time
but
as
i
did
not
appear
he
began
to
suspect
that
betterton
had
entrapped
me
so
he
hastened
to
the
coachmaker
and
having
explained
to
him
that
i
was
no
swindler
and
having
paid
him
for
the
barouche
he
told
him
as
he
learned
from
jerry
that
betterton
was
one
of
those
who
had
assaulted
the
postilion
and
constables
the
coachmaker
therefore
applied
at
the
and
a
party
was
dispatched
to
apprehend
betterton
stuart
accompanied
them
and
thus
gained
admission
which
he
could
not
otherwise
have
done
into
the
house
higginson
now
told
a
lamentable
tale
of
the
pranks
that
betterton
had
played
on
him
and
amongst
the
rest
mentioned
that
a
servant
had
seduced
him
into
the
bag
by
pretending
to
be
his
friend
and
to
smuggle
him
out
of
the
house
in
the
character
of
meal
he
could
gather
from
several
things
said
while
the
company
were
tormenting
him
that
grundy
had
agreed
to
marry
me
and
then
for
a
stipulated
sum
to
give
betterton
opportunities
of
prosecuting
his
infamous
designs
thus
both
of
them
would
escape
the
penalties
of
the
law
he
likewise
informed
me
that
the
female
guests
were
to
use
his
own
words
ladies
whom
the
male
guests
loved
better
than
they
ought
to
do
and
he
then
explained
that
the
several
rooms
were
furnished
according
to
the
fashions
of
different
countries
grecian
persian
chinese
italian
and
that
mine
was
the
gothic
chamber
by
this
time
having
reached
the
village
and
stopped
at
an
inn
where
we
meant
to
sleep
i
desired
a
room
and
bade
stuart
a
hasty
good
night
shocked
astonished
and
ashamed
at
all
that
had
passed
i
threw
myself
on
the
bed
and
unburdened
my
full
heart
in
a
bitter
fit
of
crying
what
thought
i
not
the
lady
cherubina
de
willoughby
after
all
the
tale
fabricated
by
betterton
himself
the
parchment
that
i
had
built
the
hope
of
my
noble
birth
upon
a
mere
lease
of
lives
could
these
things
be
alas
there
was
no
doubt
of
the
fatal
fact
i
had
overheard
the
wretches
boasting
of
it
and
i
had
discovered
their
other
impositions
with
my
own
eyes
to
be
thus
upset
in
my
favourite
speculation
in
the
business
of
my
whole
life
to
have
to
begin
all
over
again
to
have
to
search
the
wide
world
anew
for
my
real
name
my
real
family
or
was
wilkinson
indeed
my
father
oh
if
so
what
a
fall
and
how
horridly
had
i
treated
him
but
i
would
not
suffer
myself
to
think
of
it
then
to
be
laughed
at
despised
insulted
by
dissolute
creatures
calling
themselves
lords
and
barons
and
bravos
and
heroes
and
heroines
and
i
declared
to
be
no
heroine
am
i
a
heroine
i
caught
myself
constantly
repeating
and
then
i
walked
about
wildly
then
sat
on
the
bed
then
cast
my
body
across
it
once
i
fell
into
a
doze
and
dreamed
frightful
dreams
of
monsters
pursuing
me
swifter
than
the
wind
while
my
bending
limbs
could
only
creep
and
my
voice
calling
for
help
could
not
rise
above
a
whisper
then
i
woke
repeating
am
i
a
heroine
i
believe
i
was
quite
delirious
for
notwithstanding
all
that
i
could
do
to
prevent
myself
i
ran
on
rapidly
am
i
a
heroine
am
i
am
i
am
i
am
i
till
my
brain
reeled
from
its
poise
and
my
hands
were
clenched
with
perturbation
thus
passed
the
night
and
towards
morning
i
fell
into
a
slumber
adieu
letter
xlv
this
morning
my
head
felt
rather
better
and
i
appeared
before
stuart
with
the
sprightliest
air
imaginable
not
that
my
mind
was
at
ease
far
from
it
but
that
i
could
not
endure
to
betray
my
mortification
at
having
proved
such
a
dupe
to
buffoons
and
villains
after
breakfast
we
began
arranging
our
plans
and
decided
on
proceeding
to
london
but
did
not
determine
on
my
place
of
residence
there
i
had
my
own
projects
however
as
higginson
had
assisted
in
rescuing
me
from
the
police
stuart
advised
him
to
remain
concealed
somewhere
till
after
the
trials
of
betterton
and
grundy
for
though
the
poor
man
did
not
know
that
they
were
officers
of
justice
whom
he
was
assaulting
he
having
been
in
the
turret
when
the
fray
commenced
yet
this
fact
might
be
difficult
to
prove
stuart
therefore
gave
him
some
money
and
i
a
letter
and
he
set
off
in
extreme
tribulation
for
the
cottage
of
the
poor
woman
there
to
stay
till
the
business
should
be
decided
stuart
and
i
then
took
our
departure
in
a
chaise
unable
to
counterfeit
gaiety
long
i
relapsed
into
languor
nor
could
my
companion
by
any
effort
withdraw
me
from
the
contemplation
of
my
late
disgrace
as
we
drew
near
lady
gwyn
he
represented
the
propriety
of
my
restoring
her
portrait
lest
she
should
have
recourse
to
an
arrest
disheartened
by
the
past
and
terrified
for
the
future
i
soon
consented
and
on
our
arriving
at
the
avenue
of
the
gentleman
who
had
the
portrait
in
his
possession
stuart
by
my
desire
went
to
the
house
without
me
he
was
absent
some
time
but
at
last
came
back
with
it
in
his
hand
we
then
drove
to
lady
gwyn
and
while
i
remained
at
the
gate
he
proceeded
to
execute
the
commission
for
me
presently
however
i
saw
him
return
accompanied
by
lady
gwyn
herself
who
welcomed
me
with
much
kindness
begged
i
would
forget
the
past
and
prevailed
on
me
to
go
into
the
house
but
it
was
only
to
suffer
new
mortifications
for
now
at
the
instance
of
stuart
she
began
to
relate
all
the
pranks
which
she
had
practised
upon
me
while
i
was
with
her
she
confessed
that
the
crowning
ceremony
was
merely
to
amuse
her
guests
at
my
expence
and
that
my
great
mother
was
her
own
nephew
think
of
that
biddy
she
said
that
stuart
who
had
known
her
for
some
years
begged
of
her
when
i
paid
her
my
first
visit
to
let
me
remain
under
her
care
till
his
return
from
town
and
to
humour
my
pretty
caprices
as
she
called
them
but
he
did
not
desire
her
to
go
so
far
with
the
jest
and
she
had
now
just
begun
an
apology
for
her
conduct
when
i
rose
overwhelmed
with
shame
and
indignation
dropped
a
hasty
courtesy
and
fairly
ran
out
of
the
house
we
proceeded
some
miles
silent
and
uncomfortable
my
heart
was
bursting
and
my
head
felt
as
if
billows
were
tossing
through
it
at
last
i
found
myself
in
sight
of
the
village
where
william
whom
i
had
separated
from
his
mistress
a
few
weeks
before
used
to
live
as
this
was
a
favourable
opportunity
for
reconciling
the
lovers
i
now
made
stuart
acquainted
with
the
real
origin
of
their
quarrel
which
i
had
concealed
from
him
at
the
time
it
happened
lest
he
should
mar
it
he
shook
his
head
at
the
recital
and
desired
the
driver
to
find
out
william
house
and
stop
there
this
was
done
and
in
a
few
moments
william
made
his
appearance
he
betrayed
some
agitation
at
seeing
me
but
saluted
me
with
respect
william
said
i
sportively
goes
on
your
little
quarrel
with
mary
is
it
made
up
answered
he
with
a
doleful
look
i
fear
never
will
william
cried
i
with
an
assuring
nod
have
the
happiness
to
tell
you
that
it
will
said
he
suppose
you
do
not
know
what
a
sad
calamity
has
fallen
upon
her
since
you
were
here
the
poor
creature
has
quite
lost
her
senses
shame
cried
i
are
you
saying
lost
her
senses
well
i
am
sure
it
was
not
my
fault
however
said
he
no
but
she
has
never
been
in
her
reason
since
the
day
you
left
her
us
be
gone
whispered
i
to
stuart
as
i
sank
back
in
the
carriage
not
said
he
is
at
least
your
duty
to
repair
the
mischief
you
have
done
should
die
before
i
could
disclose
it
cried
i
i
will
disclose
it
for
you
said
he
leaping
out
of
the
chaise
he
went
with
william
into
the
house
and
i
remained
in
such
a
state
of
mind
that
i
was
several
times
on
the
point
of
quitting
the
chaise
and
escaping
i
knew
not
whither
but
any
where
from
the
horrid
scene
awaiting
me
at
last
stuart
appeared
without
william
and
getting
in
gave
the
driver
directions
to
mary
cottage
i
wanted
him
to
go
without
me
but
he
declared
that
no
effectual
explanation
could
take
place
unless
from
myself
he
then
said
every
thing
to
me
he
told
me
that
the
poor
girl
was
quite
harmless
and
had
only
temporary
fits
of
wandering
and
that
were
the
circumstances
of
the
fatal
letter
once
explained
to
her
and
a
reconciliation
effected
she
might
eventually
recover
from
her
derangement
for
william
it
seems
had
never
divulged
the
contents
of
that
letter
as
it
enjoined
him
not
but
now
stuart
brought
it
with
him
having
arrived
near
the
cottage
we
got
out
and
walked
towards
it
with
a
faltering
step
i
crossed
the
threshold
and
found
the
father
in
the
parlour
miss
said
he
here
once
more
i
suppose
you
have
come
to
see
poor
mary
oh
is
a
piteous
piteous
sight
there
she
does
nothing
but
walk
about
and
sigh
and
talk
so
wild
and
nobody
can
tell
the
cause
but
that
william
and
he
will
not
for
he
says
she
forbade
him
with
me
said
stuart
i
will
tell
you
the
cause
he
then
led
the
miserable
old
man
out
of
the
room
and
i
remained
at
the
window
weeping
but
in
a
few
minutes
i
heard
a
step
and
on
turning
round
saw
the
father
running
towards
me
with
a
face
haggard
and
ghastly
and
crying
out
cruel
cruel
then
grasping
my
shoulder
and
lifting
his
tremulous
hand
to
heaven
said
he
the
lightning
of
a
just
and
good
providence
pray
cried
i
snatching
down
his
hand
pray
do
not
curse
me
do
not
curse
a
poor
silly
mad
creature
it
was
a
horrid
affair
very
horrid
but
indeed
indeed
i
meant
no
harm
calm
my
good
man
said
stuart
let
us
go
to
the
garden
where
your
daughter
is
walking
i
am
sure
this
young
lady
will
not
refuse
to
accompany
us
and
do
her
utmost
in
this
critical
moment
will
do
any
thing
cried
i
along
we
now
passed
into
the
garden
and
i
shuddered
as
i
beheld
the
beautiful
wreck
at
a
distance
she
had
just
stopt
short
in
a
stepping
posture
her
cloak
had
half
fallen
from
her
shoulders
and
as
her
head
hung
down
her
forefinger
was
lightly
laid
on
her
lip
panting
to
tell
her
all
i
flew
towards
her
and
caught
her
hand
you
remember
me
mary
said
i
softly
she
looked
at
me
some
moments
with
a
faint
smile
and
at
last
she
coloured
yes
i
remember
you
said
she
were
with
us
that
very
evening
when
i
was
so
wretched
but
i
do
care
about
him
now
i
do
indeed
and
if
i
could
only
see
him
once
more
i
would
tell
him
so
and
then
i
would
frown
and
turn
from
him
and
then
he
would
follow
so
sad
and
so
pale
do
you
think
he
would
and
i
am
keeping
his
presents
to
give
back
to
him
as
he
did
mine
and
see
how
i
have
my
hair
parted
on
my
forehead
just
as
he
used
to
like
it
ready
the
moment
i
see
him
to
rumple
it
all
about
and
then
he
will
cry
so
you
think
he
will
and
then
i
will
run
run
run
away
like
the
wind
and
never
see
him
again
never
never
again
dear
mary
said
i
shall
see
him
again
and
be
friends
with
him
too
your
william
is
still
faithful
to
you
most
faithful
and
still
loves
you
better
than
his
life
i
have
seen
him
myself
this
moment
have
cried
she
reddening
and
what
did
he
say
but
hush
not
a
word
before
my
father
and
that
man
and
she
put
one
hand
upon
my
mouth
and
with
the
other
round
my
waist
hurried
me
into
a
little
arbour
where
we
sat
down
now
whispered
she
stealing
her
arms
about
my
neck
and
looking
earnestly
into
my
eyes
while
her
whole
frame
shook
now
what
did
he
say
said
i
with
a
serious
tone
and
aspect
must
collect
your
ideas
and
listen
attentively
for
i
have
much
to
disclose
do
you
recollect
a
letter
that
i
got
you
to
write
for
me
when
i
was
here
last
muttered
she
yes
i
believe
i
do
oh
yes
i
recollect
it
well
for
it
was
a
sad
letter
to
your
sweetheart
telling
him
that
you
had
married
another
and
your
sweetheart
name
was
william
and
i
thought
at
the
time
i
would
never
write
such
a
letter
to
my
own
william
yet
mary
said
i
own
william
got
that
letter
by
some
mistake
for
i
could
not
bear
to
tell
the
real
fact
very
evening
and
seeing
it
in
your
and
addressed
to
william
he
thought
it
was
from
you
to
him
and
so
he
gave
you
back
your
presents
and
is
all
that
cried
mary
starting
up
powers
say
all
that
over
again
i
made
her
sit
down
and
i
shewed
her
the
letter
as
she
read
it
her
colour
changed
her
lip
quivered
her
hand
shook
and
at
the
conclusion
she
dropped
it
with
a
dreadful
groan
and
remained
quite
motionless
cried
i
mary
do
not
look
so
speak
mary
and
i
stirred
her
shoulder
but
she
still
sat
motionless
with
a
fixed
smile
shall
i
will
see
her
cried
the
voice
of
william
at
a
distance
and
the
next
instant
he
was
seated
breathless
by
her
side
my
mary
cried
he
in
the
most
touching
accents
at
the
voice
she
started
and
turned
towards
him
but
in
a
moment
averted
her
face
and
rose
as
pale
as
ashes
then
drawing
some
letters
and
baubles
from
her
bosom
she
threw
them
into
his
lap
and
began
gently
disarranging
her
hair
all
the
time
looking
sideways
at
him
with
an
air
of
pretty
dignity
said
she
taking
my
hand
and
leading
me
out
of
the
arbour
was
not
that
glorious
now
i
shall
die
content
said
i
having
first
killed
your
william
have
i
not
explained
all
about
the
letter
and
how
can
you
now
treat
him
so
cruelly
letter
said
she
true
the
letter
let
me
consider
a
moment
he
thought
it
was
mine
do
you
say
did
indeed
mary
and
yet
you
will
not
be
friends
with
him
you
see
he
wo
follow
me
said
she
would
have
followed
me
once
is
he
following
me
can
not
answered
i
poor
young
man
is
lying
on
the
ground
and
sobbing
ready
to
break
his
heart
mary
stopped
i
call
him
said
i
now
said
she
can
i
prevent
you
cried
i
calls
you
william
came
flying
towards
her
at
the
sound
of
his
steps
she
turned
stretched
forth
her
hands
uttered
a
long
and
piercing
cry
and
they
were
locked
in
each
other
arms
but
the
poor
girl
quite
overpowered
by
the
sudden
change
fell
back
insensible
while
william
kissing
her
and
weeping
over
her
bore
her
into
the
house
and
laid
her
on
a
bed
it
was
so
long
before
she
shewed
any
symptoms
of
animation
that
we
began
to
feel
serious
alarm
and
william
ran
to
the
village
for
an
apothecary
by
degrees
she
came
to
herself
and
appeared
somewhat
more
composed
but
still
wandering
at
last
with
her
hand
clasped
in
her
lover
she
fell
asleep
and
then
as
our
presence
could
be
no
farther
useful
we
took
leave
of
the
venerable
peasant
who
generous
with
recent
hope
freely
gave
me
his
forgiveness
and
his
blessing
in
my
first
transports
of
anguish
at
this
scene
i
disclosed
to
stuart
what
i
had
all
day
determined
but
dreaded
to
tell
the
situation
of
my
father
in
the
madhouse
at
the
horrid
account
the
good
young
man
turned
pale
but
said
not
a
word
i
saw
that
i
was
undone
and
i
burst
into
tears
comforted
my
dear
girl
said
he
laying
his
hand
on
mine
have
long
been
acting
under
the
delusion
of
a
dreadful
dream
but
this
confession
and
these
tears
are
i
trust
the
prognostics
of
a
total
renunciation
of
error
so
now
let
us
hasten
to
your
father
and
release
him
he
shall
forgive
you
past
follies
shall
be
forgotten
past
pleasures
renewed
you
shall
return
to
your
real
home
and
cherry
wilkinson
shall
again
be
the
daughter
of
an
honest
squire
stuart
said
i
to
my
past
follies
i
know
of
none
but
two
mary
and
my
father
matters
and
as
to
that
father
he
may
not
be
what
you
suppose
him
i
fancy
sir
there
are
such
things
as
men
who
begin
life
with
plain
names
and
end
it
with
the
most
italian
in
the
world
cried
stuart
said
i
honest
squire
as
you
call
him
may
yet
come
out
to
be
a
marquis
stuart
groaned
and
put
his
head
out
at
the
window
we
have
reached
london
and
i
take
the
opportunity
to
write
while
stuart
is
procuring
from
grundy
who
now
lies
in
prison
such
a
statement
as
can
not
fail
to
make
the
doctor
release
my
poor
father
without
hesitation
how
shall
i
support
this
approaching
interview
i
shall
sink
i
shall
die
under
it
indeed
i
wish
to
die
and
i
feel
an
irresistible
presentiment
that
my
prayer
will
shortly
be
granted
all
day
long
i
have
a
horrid
gloom
hanging
over
me
besides
a
frequent
wildness
of
ideas
and
an
unusual
irritability
i
have
a
chilliness
and
yet
a
burning
through
my
skin
and
i
am
unwilling
even
to
move
if
i
could
lock
myself
up
in
a
room
with
heaps
of
romances
and
shut
out
all
the
world
i
sometimes
fancy
that
i
should
be
happy
but
no
my
friend
the
grave
will
soon
be
my
chamber
the
worms
my
books
and
if
ever
i
write
again
i
shall
write
from
the
bed
of
death
i
know
it
i
feel
it
i
shall
be
reconciled
to
my
dear
parent
acknowledge
my
follies
and
die
adieu
letter
xlvi
agitated
beyond
measure
i
found
myself
at
the
madhouse
without
well
knowing
how
i
had
got
there
and
stuart
after
a
long
altercation
with
the
doctor
supported
me
to
the
room
where
my
father
was
confined
he
had
to
push
me
gently
before
him
and
as
i
stopped
breathless
inside
the
door
i
saw
by
the
dusky
twilight
a
miserable
object
shivering
and
sitting
on
a
bed
a
few
rags
and
a
blanket
were
cast
about
it
the
face
was
haggard
and
the
chin
overgrown
with
a
grisly
beard
yet
amidst
all
this
disfigurement
i
could
not
mistake
my
father
i
ran
prostrated
myself
at
his
feet
and
clasping
his
knees
exclaimed
dear
father
he
started
and
gazed
at
me
for
a
moment
then
flung
me
from
him
and
threw
himself
with
his
face
downward
on
the
bed
i
cast
my
body
across
his
and
endeavoured
with
both
my
hands
to
turn
round
his
head
that
i
might
embrace
him
but
he
resisted
every
effort
cried
i
clasping
his
neck
you
break
my
heart
will
you
drive
me
to
distraction
speak
father
oh
one
word
one
little
word
to
save
me
from
death
still
he
lay
mute
and
immoveable
are
cold
father
said
i
shiver
shall
i
put
something
about
you
shall
i
father
ah
i
can
be
so
kind
and
so
tender
when
i
love
one
and
i
love
you
dearly
heaven
knows
i
do
i
stole
my
hand
on
one
of
his
and
lay
caressing
his
forehead
and
murmuring
words
of
fondness
in
his
ear
but
nothing
could
avail
he
withdrew
his
hand
by
degrees
and
buried
his
forehead
deeper
in
the
cloaths
and
now
half
frantic
i
began
to
wring
my
hands
and
beat
the
pillow
and
moan
and
utter
the
most
deplorable
lamentations
at
last
i
thought
i
saw
him
a
little
convulsed
as
if
with
smothered
tears
cried
i
are
relenting
you
are
weeping
bless
you
for
that
dear
dear
father
look
up
and
see
with
what
joy
a
daughter
can
embrace
you
child
my
child
cried
he
turning
and
throwing
himself
upon
my
bosom
heart
of
stone
could
not
withstand
this
there
there
there
i
forgive
you
all
fast
and
fondly
did
we
cling
round
each
other
and
sweet
were
the
sighs
that
we
breathed
and
the
tears
that
we
shed
but
i
suffered
too
much
the
disorder
which
had
some
time
been
engendering
in
my
frame
now
burst
forth
with
alarming
vehemence
and
i
was
conveyed
raving
into
a
carriage
on
our
arrival
at
the
hotel
they
sent
for
a
physician
who
pronounced
me
in
a
violent
fever
of
a
nervous
nature
for
a
fortnight
i
was
not
expected
to
recover
and
i
myself
felt
so
convinced
of
my
speedy
dissolution
that
i
requested
the
presence
of
a
clergyman
he
came
and
his
conversations
by
composing
my
mind
contributed
in
a
great
degree
to
my
recovery
at
my
request
he
paid
me
daily
visits
our
subject
was
religion
not
those
theological
controversies
which
excite
so
much
irreligious
feeling
and
teach
men
to
hate
each
other
for
the
love
of
god
but
those
plain
and
simple
truths
which
convince
without
confounding
and
which
avoid
the
bigotry
that
would
worship
error
because
it
is
hereditary
and
the
fanaticism
that
would
lay
rash
hands
on
the
holy
temple
because
some
of
its
smaller
pillars
appear
unsound
after
several
days
of
discussion
on
this
important
topic
he
led
me
by
degrees
to
give
him
an
account
of
my
late
adventures
and
as
i
related
he
made
comments
affected
by
his
previous
precepts
and
by
my
own
awful
approach
to
eternity
which
had
suppressed
in
my
heart
the
passions
of
ambition
and
pride
i
now
became
as
desirous
of
conviction
as
i
had
heretofore
been
sophistical
in
support
of
my
folly
to
be
predisposed
is
to
be
half
converted
and
soon
this
exemplary
pastor
convinced
my
understanding
of
the
impious
and
immoral
tendency
of
my
past
life
he
shewed
me
that
to
the
inordinate
gratification
of
a
particular
caprice
i
had
sacrificed
my
duty
towards
my
natural
protectors
myself
and
my
god
that
my
ruling
passion
though
harmless
in
its
nature
was
injurious
in
its
effects
that
it
gave
me
a
distaste
for
all
sober
occupations
perverted
my
judgment
and
even
threatened
me
with
the
deprivation
of
my
reason
religion
itself

with
immoderate
enthusiasm

last
degenerates
into
zealotry
and
leaves
the
poor
devotee
too
rapturous
to
be
rational
and
too
virulent
to
be
religious
in
a
word
i
have
risen
from
my
bed
an
altered
being
and
i
now
look
back
on
my
past
delusions
with
abhorrence
and
disgust
though
the
new
principles
of
conduct
which
i
have
adopted
are
not
yet
rooted
or
methodized
in
my
mind
and
though
the
prejudices
of
a
whole
life
are
not
and
indeed
could
not
be
entirely
eradicated
in
a
few
days
still
as
i
am
resolved
on
endeavouring
to
get
rid
of
them
i
trust
that
my
reason
will
second
my
desire
and
that
the
final
consequence
of
my
perceiving
what
is
erroneous
will
be
my
learning
what
is
correct

my
health
is
now
so
far
that
i
am
no
longer
confined
to
my
room
stuart
pays
us
constant
visits
and
his
lively
advice
and
witty
reasoning
more
complimentary
than
reproachful
and
more
insinuated
than
expressed
have
tended
to
perfect
my
reformation
he
had
put
don
quixote
a
work
which
i
never
read
before
into
my
hands
and
on
my
returning
it
to
him
with
a
confession
of
the
benefit
that
i
derived
from
it
the
conversation
naturally
ran
upon
romances
in
general
he
thus
delivered
his
sentiments
do
not
protest
against
the
perusal
of
fictitious
biography
altogether
for
many
works
of
this
kind
may
be
read
without
injury
and
some
with
profit
novels
such
as
the
vicar
of
wakefield
the
fashionable
tales
and
coelebs
which
draw
man
as
he
is
imperfect
instead
of
man
as
he
can
not
be
superhuman
are
both
instructive
and
entertaining
romances
such
as
the
mysteries
of
udolpho
the
italian
and
the
bravo
of
venice
which
address
themselves
to
the
imagination
alone
are
often
captivating
and
seldom
detrimental
but
unfortunately
so
seductive
are
the
latter
class
of
composition
that
one
is
apt
to
neglect
more
useful
books
for
them
besides
when
indulged
in
extreme
they
tend
to
incapacitate
us
from
encountering
the
turmoils
of
active
life
they
present
us
with
incidents
and
characters
which
we
can
never
meet
in
the
world
and
act
upon
the
mind
like
intoxicating
stimulants
first
elevate
and
at
last
enervate
it
they
teach
us
to
revel
in
ideal
scenes
of
transport
and
distraction
and
harden
our
hearts
against
living
misery
by
making
us
so
refined
as
to
feel
disgust
at
its
unpoetical
accompaniments
a
country
where
morals
are
on
the
decline
novels
always
fall
several
degrees
below
the
standard
of
national
virtue
and
the
contrary
holds
in
an
opposite
state
of
things
for
as
these
works
are
an
exaggerated
picture
of
the
times
they
represent
the
prevalent
opinions
and
manners
with
a
gigantic
pencil
thus
since
france
became
depraved
her
novels
have
become
dissolute
and
since
her
social
system
arrived
at
its
extreme
of
vicious
refinement
they
too
have
adopted
that
last
of
refined
vice
which
wins
the
heart
by
the
chastest
aphorisms
and
then
corrupts
it
by
the
most
alluring
pictures
of
villainy
take
rousseau
for
instance
what
preux
is
to
heloise
the
book
is
to
the
reader
the
lover
so
fascinates
his
mistress
by
his
honourable
sentiments
that
she
can
not
resist
his
criminal
advances
the
book
infatuates
the
reader
till
in
his
admiration
of
its
morality
he
loses
all
recollection
of
its
licentiousness
for
as
virtue
is
more
captivating
so
vice
is
less
disgusting
when
adorned
with
the
graces
it
may
be
said
that
an
author
ought
to
portray
vice
in
its
seductive
colours
for
the
purpose
of
unmasking
its
arts
and
thus
warning
the
young
and
inexperienced
but
let
it
be
recollected
that
though
familiarity
with
enchanting
descriptions
of
vice
may
add
to
prudence
it
must
diminish
virtue
and
that
while
it
teaches
the
reason
to
resist
it
entices
the
passions
to
yield
it
was
rousseau
system
however
to
paint
the
scenes
of
a
brothel
in
order
to
speak
the
cant
of
a
monastery
and
thus
has
he
undone
many
an
imitating
miss
or
wife
who
began
by
listening
to
the
language
of
love
that
she
might
talk
sentiment
and
act
virtue
and
ended
by
falling
a
victim
to
it
because
her
heart
had
become
entangled
her
head
bewildered
and
her
principles
depraved
though
we
seldom
see
such
publications
in
this
country
yet
there
is
a
strain
of
but
false
morality
prevalent
in
some
i
will
add
for
why
should
i
conceal
it
from
you
that
your
principles
which
have
hitherto
been
formed
upon
such
books
alone
appear
at
times
a
little
perverted
by
their
influence
it
should
now
therefore
be
your
object
to
counteract
these
bad
effects
by
some
more
rational
line
of
reading
and
as
your
ideas
of
real
life
are
drawn
from
novels
and
as
even
your
manners
and
language
are
vitiated
by
them
i
would
recommend
to
you
to
mix
in
the
world
to
copy
living
instead
of
imaginary
beings
and
to
study
the
customs
of
actual
not
ideal
society
with
this
opinion
my
father
perfectly
coincided
the
system
has
already
been
begun
and
i
now
pass
my
time
in
an
alternation
of
instruction
and
amusement
morality
history
languages
and
music
occupy
my
mornings
and
my
evenings
are
sometimes
enlivened
by
balls
operas
and
familiar
parties

therefore
we
shall
remain
some
time
in
town
my
father
has
taken
a
house

my
counsellor
and
my
companion
sits
by
my
side
directs
my
studies
my
timidity

corrects
my
mistakes
indeed
he
has
to
correct
them
often
for
i
still
retain
some
taints
of
my
former
follies
and
affectations
my
postures
are
sometimes
too
picturesque
my
phrases
too
flowery

my
sentiments
too
sublime
this

been
the
day
fixed
for
the

the
prisoners
were
brought

and
the
names
of
the
prosecutors
called
but
these
did
not
appear
and
of
consequence
the
culprits
were
discharged
it
is
supposed
that
betterton
the
great
declaimer
against
bribery
and
corruption
had
tampered
with
the

thus
escaped

adieu
letter
xlviii
in
ridding
ourselves
of
a
particular
fault
we
are
apt
at
first
to
run
too
far
into
its
opposite
virtue
i
had
poured
forth
my
tender
feelings
to
you
with
such
sentimental
absurdity
when
i
fancied
myself
enamoured
of
one
man
that
as
soon
as
i
began
to
reform
and
found
myself
actually
attached
to
another
i
determined
on
concealing
my
fondness
from
you
with
the
most
scrupulous
discretion
of
pen
perhaps
therefore
i
should
beg
your
forgiveness
for
never
having
hinted
to
you
before
what
i
am
now
about
disclosing
to
you
without
any
reserve
even
at
the
very
time
when
i
thought
i
was
bound
in
duty
to
be
devotedly
in
love
with
the
hateful
grundy
i
felt
an
unconscious
partiality
for
stuart
but
after
my
reformation
that
partiality
became
too
decisive
to
be
misinterpreted
or
concealed
and
indeed
he
was
so
constantly
with
me
and
so
kind
a
comforter
and
friend
and
then
so
fascinating
are
his
manners
and
so
good
his
disposition
for
i
am
certain
there
is
no
such
young
man
at
all
you
see
in
his
eyes
what
he
is
you
see
instantly
that
his
heart
is
all
gentleness
and
benevolence
and
yet
he
has
a
fire
in
them
a
fire
that
would
delight
you
and
i
could
tell
you
a
thousand
anecdotes
of
him
that
would
astonish
but
what
have
i
done
with
my
sentence
go
back
good
pen
and
restore
it
to
the
grammar
it
deserves
or
rather
leave
it
as
it
is
a
cripple
for
life
and
hasten
to
the
happy
catastrophe
with
a
secret
transport
which
i
can
not
describe
i
began
of
late
to
perceive
that
stuart
had
become
more
assiduous
than
usual
in
his
visits
to
me
that
his
manners
betrayed
more
tenderness
and
his
language
more
regard
these
attentions
increased
daily
nor
did
he
omit
opportunities
of
hinting
his
passion
in
terms
which
i
could
not
mistake
this
morning
however
put
the
matter
beyond
a
doubt
i
was
alone
when
he
came
to
pay
his
accustomed
visit
at
first
he
made
some
faint
attempts
at
conversing
upon
indifferent
topics
but
all
the
time
i
could
perceive
an
uneasiness
and
perturbation
in
his
manner
that
surprised
me
said
i
at
length
makes
you
so
dull
and
absent
replied
he
with
a
smile
what
have
i
done
said
i
not
what
you
have
done
answered
he
what
you
will
do
what
is
that
said
i
he
changed
to
a
nearer
chair
and
looked
at
me
with
much
agitation
i
guessed
what
was
coming
i
had
expected
it
some
time
but
now
when
the
moment
arrived
i
felt
my
heart
fail
so
i
suddenly
moved
towards
the
door
saying
that
i
was
sure
i
heard
my
father
call
stuart
sprang
after
me
and
led
me
back
by
the
hand
i
tell
you
said
he
on
the
possession
of
this
hand
depends
my
happiness
may
i
flatter
myself
with
the
hope
that
my
happiness
would
not
contribute
to
your
misery
i
am
no
longer
a
heroine
said
i
smiling
do
not
intend
to
get
up
a
scene
you
happen
to
have
my
hand
now
and
i
am
afraid
very
much
afraid
that
what
cried
he
holding
it
faster
it
is
not
worth
withdrawing
said
i
but
in
this
effort
to
shun
a
romance
eclaircissement
i
had
i
feared
run
into
the
contrary
extreme
and
betrayed
an
undue
boldness
so
i
got
sentimental
in
good
earnest
and
burst
into
tears
stuart
led
me
to
my
chair
and
soon
dissipated
my
uneasiness
by
his
eloquent
expressions
of
gratitude
and
delight
and
his
glowing
pictures
of
our
future
happiness
i
told
him
that
i
wondered
how
he
who
knew
my
failings
so
well
would
venture
to
stake
his
happiness
upon
me
was
by
my
knowledge
of
your
failings
said
he
i
discovered
your
perfections
those
embarrassments
of
your
life
which
i
witnessed
have
enabled
me
to
judge
of
you
more
justly
in
a
few
months
than
had
i
been
acquainted
with
you
whole
years
in
the
common
routine
of
intercourse
they
have
shewn
me
that
if
you
had
weakness
enough
to
court
danger
you
had
firmness
enough
to
withstand
temptation
and
that
while
the
faulty
part
of
your
character
was
factitious
and
superinduced
all
the
pure
and
generous
impulses
came
from
your
heart
our
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
sudden
entrance
of
my
father
and
on
his
hearing
from
stuart
who
it
seems
had
made
him
a
confidant
the
favourable
issue
of
our
interview
the
good
old
man
hugged
both
of
us
in
his
arms
to
detain
you
no
longer
a
week
hence
is
fixed
for
our
wedding
i
have
just
received
a
letter
from
mary
mentioning
her
perfect
restoration
to
health
and
her
union
with
william
i
shall
offer
no
observation
on
your
late
marriage
with
the
butler
but
i
must
remark
that
your
reason
for
having
never
given
me
advice
during
my
follies
namely
because
my
father
had
deprived
you
of
the
right
to
do
so
evinced
more
anger
towards
him
than
love
for
me
however
i
shall
always
be
happy
to
hear
of
your
welfare
adieu
letter
xlix
i
have
just
time
to
tell
you
before
i
leave

that
my
fate
was
sealed
this
morning
and
that
i
am
a
wife
on
my
return
to
the
house
after
the
ceremony
i
found
an
epithalamium
addressed
to
me
by
poor
higginson
but
it
was
more
filled
with
hints
at
his
own
misery
than
congratulations
upon
my
happiness
honest
jerry
sullivan
met
me
at
the
door
and
shook
my
hand
and
danced
round
me
in
a
fury
of
outrageous
joy
cried
he
and
often
i
thought
your
freaks
would
get
you
hanged
but
may
i
be
hanged
if
ever
i
thought
they
would
get
you
married
see
said
i
to
stuart
all
your
pains
to
prevent
me
from
imitating
romances
you
have
made
me
terminate
my
adventures
like
a
true
romance
in
a
wedding
pray
with
what
moral
will
you
now
conclude
the
book
will
say
returned
he
virtue
no
that
calamity
no
that
fortitude
and
resignation
oh
no
i
will
say
then
that
tommy
horner
was
a
bad
boy
and
would
not
get
plumcake
and
that
king
pepin
was
a
good
boy
and
rode
