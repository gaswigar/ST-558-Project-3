chapter
i
the
beeman
the
road
was
a
sunny
dusty
one
leading
upward
through
medford
valley
with
hills
on
each
side
whose
far
outline
quivered
in
the
hot
breathless
air
of
afternoon
oliver
peyton
seemed
to
have
no
regard
for
heat
or
dust
however
but
trudged
along
with
such
a
determined
stride
that
people
passing
turned
to
look
after
him
and
more
than
one
swift
motor
car
curved
aside
to
give
him
room
want
a
ride
inquired
one
genial
farmer
drawing
up
beside
him
where
are
you
going
oliver
turned
to
answer
the
first
question
meaning
to
reply
with
a
relieved
yes
but
his
square
sunburned
face
hardened
at
the
second
oh
i
am
just
going
down
the
road
a
little
way
he
replied
stiffly
shook
his
head
at
the
repeated
offer
of
a
lift
and
tramped
on
in
the
dust
the
next
man
he
met
seemed
also
to
feel
a
curiosity
as
to
his
errand
for
he
stopped
a
very
old
shambling
horse
to
lean
from
his
seat
and
ask
where
may
you
be
going
in
such
a
hurry
on
such
a
hot
day
oliver
looking
up
at
the
person
who
addressed
him
and
gauging
his
hard
gray
eyes
and
his
narrow
dark
face
conceived
an
instant
dislike
and
distrust
of
the
stranger
he
replied
shortly
as
he
had
before
but
with
less
good
temper
i
am
going
down
the
road
a
little
way
and
as
you
say
i
am
rather
in
a
hurry
oh
are
you
indeed
returned
the
man
measuring
the
boy
up
and
down
with
a
disagreeable
inquisitive
glance
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
to
have
your
manners
with
you
even
he
shot
him
a
look
of
keen
and
hostile
penetration
it
almost
looks
as
though
you
were
running
away
from
something
he
stopped
for
no
further
comment
but
went
jingling
off
in
his
rattletrap
cart
the
cloud
of
dust
raised
by
his
old
horse
clumsy
feet
hanging
long
in
the
air
behind
him
oliver
plodded
forward
muttering
dark
threats
against
the
disagreeable
stranger
and
wishing
that
he
had
been
sufficiently
quick
of
speech
to
contradict
him
yet
the
random
guess
was
a
correct
one
and
running
away
was
just
what
oliver
was
doing
he
had
not
really
meant
to
when
he
came
out
through
the
pillared
gateway
of
his
cousin
place
he
had
only
thought
that
he
would
walk
down
the
road
toward
the
station
and
see
the
train
come
in
yet
the
resolve
had
grown
within
him
as
he
thought
of
all
that
had
passed
in
the
last
few
days
and
as
he
looked
forward
to
what
was
still
to
come
as
he
walked
down
the
road
rattling
the
money
in
his
pockets
turning
over
his
wrongs
in
his
mind
the
thought
had
come
swiftly
to
him
that
he
need
no
longer
endure
things
as
they
were
it
was
three
miles
to
the
railroad
station
but
once
there
he
could
be
whisked
away
from
all
the
troubles
that
had
begun
to
seem
unendurable
the
inviting
whistle
of
a
train
seemed
to
settle
the
matter
finally
it
is
as
though
i
were
afraid
of
anything
he
reflected
looking
back
uneasily
if
i
thought
i
were
afraid
i
would
never
go
away
and
leave
janet
behind
like
this
no
i
am
only
going
because
i
will
not
be
made
to
do
what
i
hate
he
told
himself
this
several
times
by
way
of
reassurance
but
seemed
always
to
find
it
necessary
to
say
it
again
there
were
some
strange
things
about
the
place
where
he
and
his
younger
sister
janet
had
come
to
make
a
visit
things
that
made
him
feel
even
on
the
first
day
that
the
whole
house
was
haunted
by
some
vague
disquiet
of
which
no
one
would
tell
him
the
cause
his
cousin
jasper
had
changed
greatly
since
they
had
last
seen
him
he
had
always
been
a
man
of
quick
brilliant
mind
but
of
mild
and
silent
manners
yet
now
he
was
nervous
irritable
and
impatient
in
no
sense
a
genial
host
janet
oliver
sister
had
already
begun
to
love
the
place
nor
did
she
seem
to
notice
the
uneasiness
that
appeared
to
fill
the
house
she
did
not
remember
her
cousin
as
well
as
did
her
brother
and
was
thus
less
conscious
of
a
change
so
far
she
had
been
spending
her
time
very
happily
being
shown
by
brown
the
housekeeper
through
the
whole
of
cousin
jasper
great
mansion
and
inspecting
all
the
treasures
that
it
contained
it
was
a
new
house
built
only
a
year
ago
and
a
real
calamity
it
was
when
the
work
came
to
an
end
so
soon
brown
had
said
for
it
kept
peyton
interested
and
happy
all
the
time
it
was
going
on
we
had
hoped
the
south
wing
would
be
building
these
three
months
more
janet
thought
the
great
rooms
were
very
beautiful
but
oliver
did
not
like
their
vast
silence
in
which
the
slightest
sound
seemed
so
disconcertingly
loud
he
was
not
used
to
such
a
quiet
house
for
their
own
home
was
a
cozy
shabby
dwelling
full
of
the
stir
and
bustle
and
laughter
of
happy
living
here
the
boy
found
that
noises
would
burst
from
him
in
the
most
unexpected
and
involuntary
manner
noises
that
the
long
rooms
and
passageways
seemed
to
take
up
and
echo
and
magnify
a
hundred
times
brown
was
constantly
urging
him
not
to
disturb
poor
peyton
and
hotchkiss
the
butler
who
went
about
with
silent
footsteps
always
looked
pained
when
oliver
slammed
a
door
or
made
a
clatter
on
the
stairs
he
had
never
seen
a
butler
before
except
in
the
movies
so
that
he
found
the
presence
of
hotchkiss
somewhat
oppressive
it
was
the
change
in
his
host
however
that
had
really
spoiled
the
visit
jasper
peyton
was
a
cousin
of
his
mother
younger
than
she
and
very
fond
of
her
and
her
children
at
their
house
he
was
always
a
guest
for
he
had
the
gift
as
their
mother
put
it
and
was
constantly
doing
delightful
things
for
them
he
was
tall
and
spare
with
a
thin
sensitive
face
that
so
it
seemed
to
oliver
was
always
smiling
then
but
that
never
smiled
now
the
boy
had
noted
a
difference
on
the
evening
of
their
arrival
even
as
they
drove
up
to
the
house
through
the
warm
darkness
and
the
drifting
fragrance
of
the
june
night
i
can
hardly
remember
how
cousin
jasper
looks
but
i
think
i
will
like
his
garden
janet
had
observed
sniffing
vigorously
oliver
nodded
but
he
was
not
listening
he
was
looking
up
at
the
lighted
house
where
the
door
stood
open
with
hotchkiss
waiting
and
where
he
could
see
through
the
long
windows
facing
the
terrace
that
cousin
jasper
was
hurrying
through
the
library
to
meet
them
in
the
hall
even
at
that
distance
their
cousin
did
not
look
the
same
he
walked
slower
he
had
lost
his
erect
carriage
and
his
old
energy
of
action
he
seemed
a
thin
ghost
of
his
former
self
with
all
spirit
and
cheerfulness
gone
out
of
him
janet
and
oliver
were
paying
their
first
visit
without
their
mother
and
to
guests
of
thirteen
and
fifteen
respectively
such
an
occasion
was
no
small
cause
for
excitement
for
that
reason
they
were
very
slow
to
admit
that
they
were
not
enjoying
themselves
but
the
truth
at
last
could
not
be
denied
cousin
jasper
preoccupied
and
anxious
left
them
almost
completely
to
their
own
devices
neglected
to
provide
any
amusement
for
them
and
seemed
at
times
to
forget
even
that
they
were
there
you
are
a
great
comfort
to
him
my
dears
he
seems
worried
and
lately
brown
had
told
them
he
does
not
like
to
be
in
this
great
house
alone
to
oliver
it
seemed
that
their
presence
meant
very
little
a
fact
which
caused
him
to
puzzle
to
chafe
and
finally
as
was
fairly
natural
to
grow
irritated
after
he
and
janet
had
explored
the
house
and
garden
there
seemed
nothing
left
to
do
for
oliver
but
to
stroll
up
and
down
the
drive
stare
through
the
tall
gates
at
the
motors
going
by
or
to
spend
hours
in
the
garage
sitting
on
a
box
and
watching
jennings
the
chauffeur
tinker
with
the
big
car
that
was
so
seldom
used
janet
was
able
to
amuse
herself
better
but
her
brother
by
the
third
day
had
reached
a
state
of
disappointed
boredom
that
was
almost
ready
at
any
small
thing
to
flare
out
into
open
revolt
the
very
small
thing
required
was
the
case
of
cousin
eleanor
they
were
all
walking
up
and
down
the
terrace
on
the
third
evening
directly
after
dinner
the
boy
and
girl
trying
to
accommodate
their
quick
steps
to
cousin
jasper
slower
and
less
vigorous
ones
their
host
was
talking
little
janet
with
an
effort
was
attending
politely
to
what
he
said
but
oliver
was
allowing
his
wits
to
go
frankly
woolgathering
it
was
still
light
enough
to
look
across
the
slopes
of
the
green
valley
and
to
see
the
shining
silver
river
and
the
roofs
of
one
or
two
big
houses
like
their
own
set
each
in
its
group
of
clustering
trees
beyond
the
stream
with
its
borders
of
willows
there
rose
a
smooth
round
hill
bare
of
woods
or
houses
with
only
one
huge
tree
at
the
very
top
and
with
what
seemed
like
a
tiny
cottage
clinging
to
the
slope
just
below
the
summit
where
that
river
bends
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
there
ought
to
be
rapids
and
good
fishing
the
boy
was
thinking
perhaps
i
might
get
over
there
to
see
some
day
he
was
suddenly
conscious
with
a
flush
of
guilt
that
cousin
jasper
was
asking
him
a
question
but
had
stopped
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
realizing
that
oliver
was
not
listening
so
he
interrupted
himself
an
old
man
talk
does
not
interest
you
eh
he
followed
oliver
glance
down
to
the
crooked
river
and
made
an
attempt
to
guess
his
thought
you
were
looking
at
that
big
stone
house
beyond
the
stream
he
said
and
i
suppose
you
were
wondering
who
lives
there
he
seemed
to
be
making
an
effort
to
turn
the
conversation
into
more
interesting
channels
so
that
oliver
immediately
gave
him
his
full
but
tardy
attention
a
cousin
of
mine
owns
the
house
we
are
really
all
cousins
or
are
related
more
or
less
we
who
own
the
land
in
medford
valley
but
tom
brighton
is
of
closer
kin
to
me
than
the
others
and
i
am
very
fond
of
him
we
have
both
been
too
busy
just
lately
to
exchange
as
many
visits
as
we
used
to
do
but
he
has
a
daughter
eleanor
just
about
your
age
oliver
a
thoroughly
nice
girl
who
would
make
a
good
playmate
for
both
of
you
i
am
neglecting
your
pleasure
i
must
have
you
meet
her
you
should
see
each
other
every
day
the
suggestion
seemed
to
afford
janet
great
delight
but
for
some
reason
it
had
the
opposite
effect
upon
oliver
perhaps
cousin
jasper
did
not
know
a
great
deal
about
younger
people
perhaps
he
had
not
been
taking
sufficient
note
of
the
ways
and
feelings
of
this
particular
two
for
it
was
quite
certain
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
oliver
cared
very
little
for
girls
and
to
have
this
one
thrust
upon
him
unawares
as
a
daily
companion
was
not
to
his
liking
it
will
be
very
nice
for
janet
he
remarked
ungraciously
but
i
i
do
have
much
to
do
with
girls
some
pure
perversity
made
him
picture
his
cousin
eleanor
as
a
prim
young
person
with
sharp
elbows
and
a
pinched
nose
and
stringy
hair
she
would
be
lifeless
and
oppressively
he
felt
certain
all
the
ill
success
of
the
last
three
days
seemed
to
be
behind
his
sudden
determination
to
have
none
of
her
but
cousin
jasper
having
once
conceived
the
idea
was
not
to
be
gainsaid
no
i
have
been
doing
the
proper
thing
for
you
we
will
have
eleanor
over
to
lunch
and
you
two
shall
go
with
jennings
in
the
car
to
fetch
her
do
protest
it
wo
be
any
trouble
later
as
they
went
upstairs
janet
pleaded
and
argued
with
a
thunderously
rebellious
oliver
who
vowed
and
insisted
that
he
would
have
no
unknown
female
cousin
thrust
upon
him
it
is
all
right
for
you
janet
he
insisted
but
i
wo
have
cousin
jasper
arranging
any
such
thing
for
me
when
i
told
him
i
did
like
girls
he
should
have
listened
no
i
do
care
if
it
is
wrong
i
am
going
to
tell
him
just
what
i
think
janet
shook
her
brown
curly
head
in
despair
i
believe
you
will
have
to
do
what
he
says
in
the
end
she
declared
the
next
morning
at
breakfast
time
oliver
had
not
relented
for
a
night
haunted
by
visions
of
this
unknown
cousin
had
in
no
way
added
to
his
peace
of
mind
i
have
been
thinking
about
that
girl
you
spoke
about
he
began
looking
across
the
table
and
over
the
wide
bowl
of
sweet
peas
to
fix
his
cousin
with
a
glance
of
firm
determination
and
i
do
really
care
to
meet
her
janet
can
go
to
fetch
her
but
you
expect
i
do
know
how
his
defense
broke
down
and
cousin
jasper
was
enough
to
laugh
stuff
and
nonsense
he
said
if
you
are
afraid
of
girls
it
is
time
you
got
over
it
i
have
telephoned
eleanor
already
but
she
come
oliver
brightened
but
relapsed
the
next
moment
into
deeper
gloom
than
ever
she
said
that
she
would
be
at
home
later
in
the
afternoon
so
you
and
janet
are
to
go
over
and
call
on
her
i
have
ordered
the
motor
for
three
it
was
janet
suppressed
giggle
that
added
the
last
spark
to
kindling
anger
he
was
fond
of
his
cousin
jasper
he
was
troubled
concerning
him
and
disturbed
by
the
haunting
feeling
that
something
was
wrong
in
the
big
house
yet
baffled
anxiety
often
leads
to
irritation
and
irritation
in
oliver
case
was
being
tactlessly
pushed
into
rage
he
said
little
for
he
was
a
boy
of
few
words
nor
so
he
told
himself
could
he
really
be
rude
to
cousin
jasper
no
matter
how
foolishly
obstinate
he
was
but
i
get
out
of
it
somehow
he
reflected
stormily
as
he
gulped
down
his
breakfast
and
strode
out
into
the
garden
i
think
of
a
way
cudgel
his
brains
as
he
might
however
he
could
think
of
no
plausible
escape
from
the
difficulty
he
had
found
no
excuse
by
lunch
time
and
was
relieved
that
cousin
jasper
did
not
appear
being
deep
in
some
task
in
his
study
at
half
past
two
janet
went
upstairs
to
dress
and
hotchkiss
came
to
oliver
in
the
library
to
say
the
car
was
to
be
ready
at
three
sir
is
that
correct
to
which
oliver
replied
desperately
tell
jennings
to
make
it
half
past
three
i
am
going
for
a
walk
so
he
had
plunged
out
through
the
gates
and
once
away
down
the
dusty
road
he
became
more
and
more
of
a
rebel
and
finally
a
fugitive
i
wo
go
back
he
kept
saying
to
himself
i
wo
go
back
there
was
enough
money
in
his
pocket
to
take
him
home
and
there
was
a
train
from
the
junction
at
three
he
could
telephone
from
there
very
briefly
that
he
was
going
and
that
hotchkiss
was
to
send
his
things
he
was
beginning
to
discover
some
use
for
a
butler
after
all
he
trudged
on
growing
very
hot
but
feeling
more
and
more
relieved
at
the
thought
of
escape
the
way
however
was
longer
than
he
had
imagined
and
three
came
with
the
station
not
yet
in
sight
there
was
another
train
at
five
he
remembered
but
thought
that
it
would
be
better
not
to
spend
the
intervening
time
waiting
openly
on
the
platform
he
would
be
missed
long
before
then
and
jennings
and
janet
or
perhaps
even
cousin
jasper
himself
would
come
to
look
for
him
it
would
be
better
for
him
to
cross
the
nearest
meadow
and
spend
the
two
hours
in
the
woods
or
he
might
settle
the
question
over
which
he
had
been
wondering
whether
there
were
really
fish
in
that
sharp
bend
of
the
river
he
climbed
a
stone
wall
and
dropped
into
a
field
of
hay
and
daisies
toward
the
right
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
he
could
see
the
house
of
gray
stone
standing
in
the
midst
of
wide
green
gardens
and
approached
by
an
drive
at
that
very
moment
he
should
have
been
rolling
up
to
the
door
in
cousin
jasper
big
car
to
inquire
for
the
eleanor
brighton
he
made
a
wry
face
at
the
thought
and
went
hurrying
down
the
slope
of
the
hayfield
passed
through
a
grove
of
oak
and
maple
trees
and
reached
the
river
it
was
a
busy
swift
little
stream
talking
to
itself
among
the
tall
grasses
as
the
current
swept
down
toward
the
sea
a
rough
bridge
spanned
it
just
below
the
bend
and
here
he
could
stand
and
see
the
fish
for
they
were
there
as
he
had
thought
in
the
absence
of
fishing
tackle
he
could
only
watch
them
but
the
sound
of
a
car
passing
on
a
road
near
by
made
him
hurry
on
now
he
felt
he
was
away
from
indeed
another
stone
wall
patterned
with
lichen
separated
him
from
the
wilderness
of
an
old
abandoned
orchard
each
one
of
the
twisted
apple
trees
looked
at
least
a
thousand
years
of
age
so
bent
gnarled
and
misshapen
had
it
become
through
the
straight
rows
he
could
look
up
the
slope
of
the
round
hill
that
he
had
so
often
watched
from
cousin
jasper
garden
he
could
make
out
the
roof
line
of
the
tiny
dilapidated
cottage
and
could
see
that
the
big
tree
at
the
summit
was
an
oak
the
orchard
was
a
deserted
waste
and
the
house
seemed
uninhabited
yet
just
below
the
summit
the
hill
was
dotted
with
small
boxlike
structures
painted
white
that
might
have
been
chicken
houses
but
seemed
scarcely
large
enough
filled
with
curiosity
he
went
forward
to
investigate
munching
as
he
went
a
yellow
june
apple
that
he
had
picked
up
in
the
grass
a
rough
lane
opened
before
him
that
passed
through
the
orchard
and
wound
up
the
hill
with
its
high
grass
trodden
a
little
as
though
after
all
people
did
sometimes
pass
that
way
he
had
climbed
only
a
little
way
when
he
heard
voices
the
cottage
was
not
empty
as
he
had
thought
for
two
people
were
standing
in
the
doorway
he
stopped
abruptly
the
man
in
worn
overalls
and
the
girl
beside
him
with
her
bobbed
hair
bright
eyes
and
faded
pink
gingham
apron
did
not
look
like
a
very
forbidding
pair
but
oliver
uneasy
conscience
made
him
feel
that
any
person
he
met
might
guess
his
plans
in
some
mysterious
way
and
interfere
with
his
escape
very
quietly
he
turned
about
and
began
to
hurry
down
the
hill
he
had
retreated
too
late
however
for
the
man
had
seen
him
and
proceeded
to
call
after
him
in
what
seemed
a
very
peremptory
tone
stop
for
a
moment
oliver
hesitated
uncertain
whether
to
obey
or
to
take
to
his
heels
and
seek
safety
in
the
wood
below
could
the
man
have
read
his
secret
or
was
the
apple
in
his
hand
the
cause
of
the
summons
before
he
could
really
decide
the
girl
voice
was
raised
also
pleading
and
urgent
we
need
you
she
called
you
must
help
us
oh
do
go
away
he
turned
slowly
and
went
toward
them
through
the
tall
grass
uncertain
suspicious
afraid
even
yet
that
he
might
fall
into
some
trap
that
would
delay
his
flight
his
uneasiness
was
not
in
any
way
quieted
by
his
seeing
that
one
of
the
white
boxes
stood
uncovered
before
the
two
and
that
it
was
a
beehive
you
have
come
just
in
time
said
the
man
if
you
are
willing
to
help
us
it
is
a
difficult
business
hiving
a
swarm
of
bees
at
this
season
and
polly
here
is
no
use
at
all
this
is
her
first
day
with
the
bees
this
year
and
she
jumps
up
and
down
when
they
sing
around
her
head
and
that
stops
everything
i
do
better
usually
the
girl
confessed
humbly
but
i
forget
over
the
winter
how
to
be
quiet
and
calm
when
a
million
bees
are
buzzing
in
my
ear
she
thrust
into
oliver
hand
the
leather
and
metal
bellows
that
blows
wood
smoke
into
the
hive
and
her
father
began
giving
him
directions
as
unconcernedly
as
though
his
helping
were
a
matter
of
course
just
stand
beside
me
stay
very
still
and
keep
blowing
smoke
that
is
right
do
move
and
never
mind
how
close
the
bees
come
there
is
no
danger
of
your
being
stung
the
square
white
box
was
full
of
wooden
frames
hanging
one
behind
another
like
the
leaves
of
a
book
one
by
one
the
man
lifted
them
out
swept
off
the
black
curtain
of
bees
that
clung
to
them
and
showed
the
clean
new
honeycomb
when
an
old
hive
gets
too
crowded
and
the
bees
begin
to
swarm
he
explained
we
divide
them
and
put
some
frames
and
bees
into
a
new
empty
hive
see
them
going
to
work
already
and
look
at
that
piece
of
comb
that
has
just
been
built
one
would
think
that
the
fairies
had
made
it
oliver
had
never
seen
anything
so
white
and
thin
and
delicate
as
the
frail
new
cells
ready
for
the
fresh
honey
he
forgot
any
dread
of
the
myriad
creatures
buzzing
about
his
head
he
forgot
even
his
plan
and
his
impatience
of
delay
he
bent
to
peer
into
the
hive
to
examine
the
young
bees
just
hatching
the
fat
black
and
brown
drones
and
the
slim
alert
queen
bee
the
girl
now
that
the
responsibility
of
helping
was
off
her
hands
forgot
her
own
nervousness
and
pressed
forward
also
to
look
and
ask
questions
she
must
be
about
thirteen
or
fourteen
years
old
was
oliver
vague
impression
of
her
she
had
dark
hair
and
quick
brown
eyes
her
cheeks
were
very
pink
and
one
of
them
was
decorated
with
a
black
smudge
from
the
smoke
blower
he
was
too
intent
to
notice
her
much
or
to
remember
his
fearful
dread
of
girls
and
of
course
this
little
thing
in
the
shabby
apron
was
very
different
from
the
threatened
cousin
eleanor
he
could
not
see
much
of
the
man
face
under
the
worn
straw
hat
as
they
bent
over
the
hive
but
he
liked
the
slow
drawling
voice
that
answered
his
innumerable
questions
and
he
found
the
chuckling
laugh
irresistibly
infectious
the
stranger
brown
hands
moved
with
steady
skill
among
the
horde
of
crawling
insects
until
the
last
frame
was
set
in
place
the
last
puff
of
smoke
blown
and
the
cover
was
put
down
there
young
man
said
the
beekeeper
that
was
a
good
job
well
done
thanks
to
you
but
you
must
not
go
yet
polly
and
i
always
have
a
little
lunch
here
in
the
honey
house
when
we
have
finished
to
revive
us
after
our
exhausting
labor
oliver
was
about
to
protest
that
he
must
go
on
at
once
but
the
man
interrupted
him
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
there
is
a
spring
behind
the
house
where
we
wash
up
he
said
polly
will
give
you
some
soap
and
a
towel
wood
smoke
smells
good
but
it
is
just
as
black
as
the
kind
when
he
looked
at
himself
a
moment
later
in
the
mirror
of
the
spring
oliver
realized
that
he
was
scarcely
fit
to
start
on
a
journey
since
in
his
energetic
wielding
of
the
smoker
he
had
smudged
his
face
far
worse
than
even
polly
had
he
began
splashing
and
scrubbing
but
honey
and
soot
and
the
odd
sticky
glue
with
which
bees
smear
their
hives
are
none
of
them
easy
to
remove
when
he
presented
himself
once
more
at
the
door
of
the
cottage
there
was
a
feast
spread
out
on
the
rough
table
buttered
and
toasted
biscuits
spread
with
honey
iced
cocoa
with
whipped
cream
and
a
big
square
chocolate
cake
quite
suddenly
he
remembered
how
far
he
had
walked
and
how
hungry
he
was
and
with
equal
suddenness
forgot
his
pressing
necessity
for
setting
off
again
he
sat
down
on
the
stool
that
the
beeman
offered
him
sampled
the
hot
biscuit
and
the
cold
drink
and
breathed
a
deep
involuntary
sigh
of
content
in
the
presence
of
these
friendly
shabbily
dressed
strangers
he
felt
for
the
first
time
since
leaving
home
really
happy
and
at
ease
it
seemed
dark
and
cool
within
the
little
cottage
after
the
blazing
sunshine
outside
the
place
was
evidently
no
longer
used
for
anything
but
a
storehouse
and
a
shelter
for
picnics
of
this
kind
but
it
was
a
quaint
attractive
little
dwelling
and
evidently
very
old
the
main
room
where
they
sat
had
a
ceiling
deep
casement
windows
and
a
door
that
swung
open
in
two
sections
one
above
the
other
the
upper
half
was
wide
open
now
framing
a
picture
of
the
green
slope
the
treetops
of
the
orchard
and
the
rising
hills
opposite
with
a
narrow
glimpse
of
sparkling
blue
sea
the
air
was
very
hot
and
quiet
with
the
sleepy
peacefulness
that
belongs
to
summer
afternoons
the
round
dense
shadow
of
the
oak
tree
above
them
was
lengthening
so
that
its
cool
tip
just
touched
the
doorstone
polly
with
hands
as
brown
and
skillful
as
her
father
was
still
toasting
biscuits
before
the
little
fire
they
had
built
on
the
rough
hearth
the
beeman
having
taken
off
his
hat
showed
a
handsome
cheery
face
much
like
his
daughter
except
that
his
big
nose
was
straight
rather
than
tilted
like
her
small
one
and
his
eyes
were
gray
their
clothes
were
even
older
and
shabbier
than
oliver
had
at
first
observed
but
their
manners
were
so
easy
and
cordial
that
the
whole
of
the
little
house
seemed
filled
with
the
pleasant
atmosphere
of
friendliness
polly
left
the
fire
at
last
bringing
a
plate
of
hot
biscuits
and
sat
down
beside
the
table
daddy
always
tells
me
a
story
when
we
have
finished
with
the
bees
she
began
a
little
shyly
he
said
he
had
one
saved
up
in
his
head
that
i
would
especially
like
you
wo
mind
our
going
on
with
it
will
you
oliver
would
not
mind
at
all
he
felt
assured
already
that
he
would
like
anything
that
the
beeman
had
to
say
i
suppose
you
must
have
it
if
your
heart
is
set
on
it
father
said
but
my
tales
are
usually
designed
for
an
audience
of
only
one
this
young
gentleman
may
not
like
our
style
of
stories
my
dear
i
hope
he
will
replied
polly
but
oh
daddy
i
forgot
all
about
it
did
we
have
an
engagement
some
time
about
now
at
home
no
he
returned
so
positively
that
his
daughter
though
at
first
a
little
puzzled
seemed
quite
satisfied
it
is
quite
all
right
for
us
to
stay
here
he
chuckled
for
a
moment
as
though
over
some
private
joke
of
his
own
then
at
last
laid
down
his
pipe
and
crossed
his
legs
oliver
leaned
back
against
the
wall
and
polly
curled
up
on
the
bench
by
the
fireplace
are
you
both
quite
comfortable
the
beeman
inquired
very
well
then
i
begin
chapter
ii
the
seven
brothers
of
the
sun
nashola
did
not
live
in
fairyland
although
there
were
seasons
when
his
country
was
so
beautiful
that
it
might
well
have
belonged
to
some
such
enchanted
place
he
did
not
know
whether
he
loved
it
best
when
the
thickets
were
all
in
bloom
with
pink
crab
apple
and
the
brown
wintry
hills
had
put
on
their
first
spring
green
or
when
every
valley
was
scarlet
and
golden
with
maple
trees
in
the
autumn
but
it
was
neither
being
hot
midsummer
with
the
wild
grass
thick
and
soft
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
that
he
was
climbing
and
with
the
heavy
foliage
of
the
oak
tree
on
the
summit
rustling
in
a
hot
fitful
breeze
it
was
high
noontide
with
the
sunlight
all
about
him
yet
nashola
walked
warily
and
looked
back
more
than
once
at
his
comrades
who
had
dared
follow
him
only
halfway
up
the
hill
his
was
no
ordinary
errand
for
all
about
him
nashola
felt
dangers
that
he
could
neither
hear
nor
see
before
him
sitting
motionless
as
a
statue
with
his
back
against
the
trunk
of
the
oak
tree
and
his
keen
face
turned
toward
the
hills
and
the
sky
was
secotan
the
sorcerer
and
medicine
man
whom
all
of
nashola
tribe
praised
revered
and
dreaded
none
but
the
warriors
used
to
venture
to
have
speech
with
him
and
then
only
as
he
sat
in
the
door
of
his
lodge
with
the
men
in
a
half
circle
before
him
they
never
came
alone
along
all
the
seaboard
the
indians
talked
of
secotan
the
man
most
potent
in
spells
and
charms
and
prophecies
who
was
said
to
talk
with
strange
spirits
in
his
lodge
by
night
and
who
could
call
up
storms
out
of
the
sea
at
will
this
spot
at
the
summit
of
the
hill
where
the
medicine
man
sat
so
often
sometimes
muttering
spells
sometimes
staring
straight
before
him
across
the
valley
was
magic
forbidden
ground
where
no
one
but
himself
was
known
to
come
yet
the
young
nashola
only
fifteen
years
old
and
far
from
being
a
warrior
had
been
told
that
he
must
consult
the
medicine
man
and
had
been
in
too
much
haste
to
seek
him
in
his
own
lodge
or
to
wait
until
he
could
persuade
a
comrade
to
go
with
him
stretched
along
the
river
below
them
was
the
camp
of
people
where
springs
gave
them
fresh
water
and
where
the
eastern
hills
of
the
valley
gave
shelter
from
the
winter
storms
that
blew
in
from
the
sea
beyond
those
green
hills
were
rocky
slopes
salt
swamps
a
stretch
of
yellow
sand
and
then
the
great
atlantic
rollers
tumbling
in
upon
the
beach
the
indians
of
nashola
village
would
go
thither
sometimes
to
dig
for
clams
to
fish
from
the
high
rocks
and
even
on
occasions
to
swim
in
the
breakers
close
to
shore
but
they
were
folk
they
feared
nothing
in
the
forest
and
would
launch
their
canoes
in
the
most
headlong
rapids
of
the
inland
rivers
yet
there
was
dread
and
awe
in
their
eyes
when
they
looked
out
upon
the
sea
not
one
of
them
had
ever
ventured
beyond
the
island
at
the
mouth
of
the
harbor
they
were
a
shifting
wandering
people
moving
here
and
there
with
the
seasons
as
the
deer
and
moose
moved
their
grazing
grounds
but
their
most
settled
abiding
place
was
this
little
green
valley
where
they
spent
a
part
of
every
year
sometimes
word
would
come
drifting
in
through
other
tribes
of
strange
men
who
had
landed
on
their
shores
but
who
always
sailed
away
again
since
this
was
still
the
time
when
america
was
all
the
indians
own
what
they
did
not
see
troubled
them
little
and
they
went
on
undisturbed
hunting
and
fishing
and
paying
their
vows
to
the
spirits
and
demons
that
they
thought
to
be
masters
of
their
little
world
the
old
wrinkled
squaw
who
was
nashola
grandmother
was
the
only
one
of
them
all
who
seemed
oppressed
with
care
the
boy
whose
parents
were
dead
was
her
special
charge
and
was
not
as
he
should
be
like
other
indian
lads
he
was
slim
and
swift
and
was
as
skillful
as
his
companions
with
the
bow
and
spear
but
he
had
a
strange
love
for
running
along
the
sea
beach
with
the
waves
snatching
at
his
bare
brown
legs
and
he
was
really
happy
only
when
he
was
swimming
in
the
green
water
the
day
he
swam
to
the
island
and
back
again
paying
no
heed
to
the
shouts
and
warnings
of
his
friends
and
declaring
when
he
landed
that
he
would
have
gone
farther
save
that
the
tide
had
turned
that
day
had
brought
his
old
grandmother
patience
to
an
end
it
is
not
fitting
that
one
of
our
tribe
should
be
so
familiar
with
the
sea
she
stormed
at
him
we
were
not
born
to
master
that
wild
salt
water
the
gods
that
rule
us
have
said
over
and
over
again
that
the
woods
and
rivers
are
ours
but
that
we
are
to
have
no
dealings
with
the
spirits
of
the
sea
since
i
can
not
make
you
listen
you
shall
talk
to
some
one
who
will
you
shall
go
to
ask
the
medicine
man
if
what
i
say
is
not
so
nashola
had
come
therefore
to
ask
his
question
but
he
found
that
it
needed
a
bold
heart
to
advance
without
quaking
into
that
silent
presence
and
to
speak
out
with
secotan
black
eyes
seeming
to
stare
him
through
and
through
is
it
true
he
began
that
men
of
our
tribe
should
have
no
trust
in
the
sea
my
grandmother
says
that
i
should
hate
it
and
fear
it
but
i
do
not
must
i
learn
to
be
afraid
slowly
the
man
nodded
most
indians
grow
old
quickly
and
are
withered
like
apples
as
soon
as
the
later
years
come
upon
them
but
secotan
although
his
hair
was
gray
had
still
the
face
with
its
arched
nose
and
heavy
brows
of
a
younger
man
only
his
eyes
deep
piercing
and
very
wise
seemed
to
show
how
long
he
had
lived
and
how
much
he
had
learned
our
fathers
and
their
fathers
before
them
have
always
known
that
we
must
distrust
the
sea
he
said
at
last
no
matter
how
blue
and
smiling
it
may
be
it
can
never
be
our
friend
we
may
swim
near
the
shore
we
may
even
launch
our
canoes
and
journey
if
the
way
be
short
from
one
harbor
to
another
when
the
sky
is
clear
and
the
winds
are
asleep
but
always
we
are
to
remember
that
the
sea
is
our
enemy
and
a
treacherous
enemy
in
the
end
he
turned
away
to
stare
at
the
hills
again
but
nashola
lingered
not
yet
satisfied
it
was
boldness
to
question
secotan
words
yet
the
boy
could
not
keep
his
hot
protests
to
himself
but
is
it
not
wrong
to
pretend
to
fear
what
we
do
not
he
objected
do
the
spirits
of
the
water
actually
rise
up
and
tell
you
that
we
must
keep
to
the
shore
i
do
not
believe
it
although
my
grandmother
says
so
until
my
ears
ring
again
secotan
turned
his
head
quickly
as
though
to
hide
the
ghost
of
a
smile
the
voices
of
the
wind
and
the
breakers
and
of
the
thunder
all
cry
the
same
message
he
declared
and
wise
men
have
learned
that
it
warns
them
to
hug
the
land
you
must
heed
your
grandmother
even
though
her
words
are
shrill
and
often
repeated
he
would
say
no
more
so
nashola
went
away
pondering
his
answer
as
he
walked
down
the
hill
after
all
no
harm
had
come
to
him
from
entering
the
medicine
man
presence
unbidden
as
his
comrades
had
all
said
he
answered
their
questions
very
shortly
as
they
came
crowding
about
him
and
to
the
persistent
queries
of
his
grandmother
he
would
say
nothing
at
all
yet
the
others
noticed
that
his
canoe
lay
unused
in
the
shelter
of
a
rock
on
the
sandy
beach
where
he
had
left
it
and
that
he
swam
in
the
sea
no
more
the
days
passed
the
hot
quiet
summer
passing
with
them
one
evening
as
they
all
sat
about
the
camp
fire
one
of
the
older
warriors
said
quietly
the
time
is
near
when
our
medicine
man
must
go
from
us
why
questioned
nashola
grandmother
while
the
boy
turned
quickly
to
hear
he
has
not
sat
upon
the
hill
nor
before
the
door
of
his
lodge
for
three
days
and
the
venison
and
corn
we
have
carried
to
him
have
lain
untouched
for
all
that
time
one
of
us
who
ventured
close
heard
a
cry
from
within
and
groaning
it
may
be
that
he
must
die
but
will
no
one
help
him
cried
nashola
it
was
not
proper
that
a
boy
should
speak
out
in
the
presence
of
the
older
warriors
but
he
could
not
keep
his
wonder
to
himself
there
is
danger
to
common
folk
in
passing
too
close
to
the
medicine
man
lodge
his
grandmother
explained
quickly
there
are
spirits
within
who
are
his
friends
but
who
might
destroy
us
and
when
he
is
ill
unto
death
and
the
beings
from
another
world
have
come
to
bear
his
soul
away
then
must
no
man
go
near
sometimes
a
medicine
man
has
a
companion
to
whom
he
teaches
his
wisdom
and
who
takes
his
place
when
he
is
gone
said
the
man
by
the
fire
but
even
that
comrade
flees
away
when
death
is
at
hand
and
the
spirits
begin
to
stand
close
about
his
master
yes
such
a
man
must
die
alone
all
through
the
night
nashola
lay
awake
thinking
of
what
he
had
heard
secotan
was
he
knew
a
man
of
powerful
magic
but
he
could
not
forget
that
there
was
a
look
in
his
eyes
and
a
kindliness
in
his
tone
that
seemed
human
after
all
must
he
suffer
and
die
there
without
help
merely
because
he
was
greater
and
wiser
than
the
rest
or
when
death
came
close
and
the
host
of
unearthly
beings
gathered
about
him
would
he
not
feel
it
of
comfort
to
have
a
living
friend
by
his
side
it
was
long
past
midnight
and
in
the
black
darkness
that
comes
before
day
before
the
boy
came
to
final
resolution
he
crawled
out
from
under
the
shelter
of
his
lodge
and
slipped
noiselessly
through
the
sleeping
camp
every
rustle
in
the
grass
every
stirring
leaf
in
the
thicket
made
him
jump
and
shiver
yet
he
kept
steadily
on
the
sharp
outline
of
secotan
pointed
lodge
poles
stood
out
against
the
stars
halfway
up
the
shoulder
of
the
hill
the
door
showed
black
and
open
as
he
came
near
but
there
was
no
sound
from
within
the
only
thing
that
seemed
alive
was
a
dull
glowing
coal
in
the
ashes
of
a
fire
that
was
not
quite
dead
the
boy
stooped
down
before
the
door
and
spoke
in
a
shaking
voice
secotan
secotan
do
you
still
live
a
hollow
gasping
whisper
sounded
from
the
shadows
within
i
am
living
but
death
is
very
near
nashola
stood
still
for
a
moment
he
could
picture
that
gaunt
figure
lying
helpless
on
the
ground
with
the
darkness
all
about
peopled
by
strange
shapes
visible
to
the
sorcerer
eyes
alone
crowding
spirits
come
to
carry
him
away
to
an
unknown
world
but
even
as
a
wave
of
icy
terror
swept
over
him
he
remembered
how
fearful
it
would
be
to
lie
all
alone
in
that
haunted
darkness
and
he
bent
low
and
slipped
through
the
door
i
know
that
all
the
spirits
of
the
earth
and
air
and
water
are
with
you
he
said
as
he
felt
his
way
to
the
deerskin
bed
and
sat
down
beside
it
but
i
thought
among
them
all
you
might
wish
for
a
friend
beside
you
who
was
flesh
and
blood
a
quivering
hand
was
laid
for
an
instant
on
his
knee
there
is
no
man
who
does
not
feel
terror
when
he
comes
to
die
alone
the
medicine
man
whispered
and
secotan
is
less
of
a
man
than
you
through
the
dragging
hours
nashola
sat
beside
him
listening
with
strained
ears
to
every
sound
the
soft
moving
of
a
snake
through
the
grass
before
the
door
the
nibbling
of
a
field
mouse
at
the
skin
of
the
tent
the
sharp
scream
of
a
bird
in
the
wood
captured
by
a
marauding
owl
the
blackness
grew
thinner
at
last
showing
the
lodge
poles
the
shabby
skins
of
the
bed
and
finally
the
sick
man
face
drawn
and
haggard
with
pain
as
the
dawn
came
up
over
the
hills
he
opened
his
eyes
and
spoke
bring
those
herbs
that
hang
against
the
lodge
pole
and
build
up
the
fire
when
the
stones
about
it
are
hot
wrap
them
in
wet
blankets
and
lay
them
in
the
tent
the
gods
may
have
decreed
that
i
am
to
live
nashola
worked
frantically
all
through
the
day
he
filled
the
lodge
with
steam
from
the
hot
stones
he
brewed
bitter
drafts
of
herbs
and
held
them
to
secotan
lips
once
in
every
hour
by
the
sun
after
a
long
time
he
saw
the
fever
ebb
saw
the
man
eyes
lose
their
strange
glittering
and
heard
his
voice
gather
strength
each
time
he
spoke
for
three
nights
and
days
the
boy
nursed
him
all
alone
in
the
lodge
with
men
bringing
food
to
leave
at
the
door
but
with
no
one
willing
to
come
inside
when
at
last
nashola
went
back
to
his
own
dwelling
secotan
was
sitting
by
his
fire
weak
and
thin
but
fairly
on
the
way
to
health
again
the
friendship
that
had
grown
up
during
that
night
of
suffering
and
terror
seemed
to
become
deeper
and
deeper
as
time
passed
there
was
scarcely
a
day
when
nashola
did
not
climb
the
hill
in
the
late
afternoon
to
sit
under
the
rustling
oak
tree
and
talk
for
a
long
hour
with
the
medicine
man
his
companions
of
his
own
age
looked
askance
at
such
a
friendship
and
his
grandmother
begged
and
scolded
but
without
avail
almost
always
as
he
sat
with
his
back
against
the
tree
or
lay
full
length
in
the
long
grass
that
was
beginning
to
be
dry
and
yellow
with
the
coming
autumn
the
boy
would
fix
his
eyes
upon
the
hills
opposite
through
which
there
showed
a
gleam
of
sea
like
the
picture
of
some
forbidden
thing
was
that
glint
of
blue
framed
by
the
green
slopes
and
the
sky
above
he
could
see
the
whitecaps
the
dancing
glimmer
of
the
sun
and
the
gray
sea
gulls
that
whirled
and
hovered
and
dipped
before
his
longing
gaze
he
would
lift
his
head
to
sniff
the
salt
breeze
that
swept
through
the
cleft
in
the
hills
and
to
listen
for
that
thunder
that
could
sometimes
be
heard
as
the
great
waves
broke
on
the
beach
at
last
one
day
when
he
had
sat
so
long
with
his
friend
that
dusk
was
falling
and
the
stars
were
coming
out
he
broke
through
the
silence
with
a
sudden
question
secotan
what
lies
beyond
that
sea
the
medicine
man
shook
his
head
without
speaking
my
grandmother
says
pursued
nashola
but
i
know
that
can
not
be
is
it
one
of
the
things
that
i
must
not
ask
and
that
you
may
not
tell
me
because
you
are
a
sorcerer
and
i
am
only
a
boy
secotan
was
silent
so
long
that
nashola
thought
he
did
not
mean
to
reply
at
all
even
when
he
spoke
it
did
not
seem
to
be
an
answer
do
you
see
those
seven
stars
he
said
that
are
rising
from
the
sea
and
that
march
so
close
together
that
you
keep
thinking
they
are
going
to
melt
into
one
yes
answered
the
boy
i
often
lie
before
our
lodge
door
and
watch
them
go
up
the
sky
there
are
bigger
stars
all
about
them
but
somehow
i
love
those
the
best
they
are
so
small
and
bright
and
seem
to
look
down
on
us
with
such
friendly
eyes
it
is
told
among
the
medicine
men
secotan
went
on
slowly
that
many
many
moons
ago
long
before
this
oak
tree
grew
upon
this
hill
before
its
father
father
had
yet
been
planted
as
an
acorn
our
people
came
hither
across
just
such
a
sea
as
that
far
to
the
westward
it
lay
and
they
came
a
mere
handful
of
bold
spirits
in
their
canoes
across
a
wide
water
from
some
land
that
we
have
utterly
forgotten
some
settled
down
at
once
upon
the
shores
of
the
waters
they
had
crossed
but
some
pressed
eastward
little
by
little
as
the
generations
passed
they
filled
the
land
with
their
children
and
in
the
end
they
came
to
another
sea
and
went
no
farther
but
the
men
who
had
led
them
were
of
a
different
heart
than
ours
there
were
always
some
who
were
not
content
to
hunt
and
fish
and
move
only
as
the
deer
move
or
as
the
seasons
change
they
wished
to
press
on
ever
on
to
let
nothing
stop
the
progress
of
their
march
it
is
said
that
when
they
came
to
this
sea
there
were
seven
brothers
who
when
their
people
would
no
longer
follow
launched
their
canoes
and
set
off
once
more
to
the
eastward
and
never
came
back
they
dwell
there
in
the
sky
we
think
and
they
shine
through
those
months
of
autumn
that
are
dearest
of
all
the
year
to
our
people
when
the
days
are
warm
and
golden
before
the
winter
when
the
woods
are
bare
and
hunting
is
easy
when
the
game
is
fat
from
the
summer
grazing
and
our
yellow
corn
is
ripe
they
come
back
to
us
in
the
hunter
moon
and
they
watch
over
us
all
through
the
cold
winter
we
call
them
the
seven
brothers
of
the
sun
nashola
was
silent
waiting
for
he
knew
from
his
friend
voice
that
there
was
more
that
he
wished
to
say
your
mother
who
is
dead
was
not
of
our
blood
they
tell
me
your
father
took
her
from
another
tribe
and
they
had
brought
her
captive
from
the
north
of
us
so
that
she
is
no
kin
of
ours
sometimes
i
think
that
there
must
have
run
in
her
veins
the
blood
of
those
seven
brothers
and
that
in
you
their
bold
spirit
lives
again
there
is
no
one
of
your
kind
who
loves
the
sea
as
you
do
who
has
no
shadow
of
a
fear
of
it
and
you
are
first
in
all
my
life
who
has
asked
me
what
lay
beyond
i
should
like
said
nashola
steadily
still
watching
the
gray
water
and
the
gleam
of
stars
above
it
i
should
like
to
go
and
see
often
i
have
wondered
the
man
went
on
his
voice
growing
very
earnest
whether
you
would
not
like
to
come
to
dwell
with
me
to
learn
the
lore
that
makes
me
a
medicine
man
and
to
take
my
place
when
i
must
go
i
who
was
taught
by
the
wisest
of
us
all
have
waited
long
to
find
some
one
worthy
of
that
teaching
and
able
to
hold
the
power
that
i
have
you
can
be
a
greater
man
than
i
nashola
not
only
your
whole
tribe
will
do
your
bidding
and
hang
upon
your
words
but
the
men
of
our
race
all
up
and
down
the
coast
will
revere
you
and
talk
of
you
as
the
greatest
sorcerer
ever
known
will
you
come
to
my
lodge
will
you
learn
from
me
will
you
follow
in
my
way
nashola
tried
to
speak
choked
and
tried
again
i
can
not
do
it
he
said
huskily
why
there
was
a
sharp
note
of
wonder
hurt
friendship
even
of
terror
in
the
man
voice
the
people
of
our
village
say
you
are
not
like
other
men
said
the
boy
they
say
you
can
call
the
friendly
spirits
of
the
forest
and
the
hostile
gods
of
the
sea
and
that
you
have
wisdom
learned
in
another
world
but
i
who
am
your
friend
think
it
is
not
so
i
love
you
dearly
but
i
know
you
are
a
man
as
i
am
i
know
the
sea
is
only
water
and
that
the
forest
is
only
trees
i
i
do
not
believe
he
got
to
his
feet
blind
with
misery
and
went
stumbling
down
the
hill
the
warm
september
darkness
was
thick
about
him
but
up
on
the
hill
the
starlight
showed
plainly
the
motionless
figure
sitting
beneath
the
oak
tree
never
turning
to
look
after
him
uttering
no
sound
of
protest
or
reproach
as
september
days
passed
into
october
as
the
seven
brothers
rode
higher
in
the
sky
strange
tales
once
again
began
to
come
from
the
south
more
white
men
had
been
seen
in
their
ships
sailing
up
and
down
the
coast
trading
with
the
indians
buying
the
fish
that
they
had
caught
and
trying
to
talk
to
them
in
an
unknown
tongue
we
have
heard
stories
before
and
will
hear
them
again
said
the
older
warriors
incredulously
such
tales
are
of
the
sort
that
old
women
tell
about
the
fires
on
winter
nights
what
does
your
friend
the
medicine
man
say
of
these
rumors
nashola
asked
one
of
the
boys
of
his
own
age
but
nashola
did
not
answer
he
went
no
more
up
the
hill
to
the
big
oak
tree
he
had
held
no
speech
for
weeks
with
secotan
yet
he
would
suffer
no
one
to
ask
him
why
a
day
came
when
the
news
could
no
longer
be
disbelieved
a
boy
of
the
tribe
who
had
been
digging
for
clams
on
the
beach
came
running
home
with
startling
tidings
the
white
men
the
winged
canoes
as
big
as
our
lodges
he
gasped
come
quickly
and
see
old
men
and
young
squaws
and
papooses
every
one
deserted
the
little
settlement
by
the
river
and
went
in
wild
haste
up
the
eastward
hills
to
look
upon
this
strange
wonder
it
was
a
lowering
day
with
overcast
skies
and
water
of
a
sullen
gray
and
with
ominously
little
wind
in
speechless
wonder
the
indians
stood
gazing
for
there
indeed
were
three
ships
moving
slowly
before
the
lazy
breeze
stanch
little
fishing
vessels
of
english
build
come
to
see
whether
this
unexplored
stretch
of
coast
would
yield
them
any
cargo
as
they
watched
the
largest
one
got
up
more
sail
veered
away
upon
a
new
tack
and
was
followed
by
the
others
what
can
they
be
are
they
come
to
destroy
us
all
asked
a
trembling
old
woman
and
no
one
could
answer
hush
said
another
in
a
moment
the
medicine
man
is
coming
secotan
who
so
seldom
left
his
own
lodge
now
and
who
never
mixed
with
the
village
folk
was
climbing
slowly
up
the
hill
after
them
nashola
noticed
that
he
had
begun
to
look
old
that
his
fierce
face
was
sunken
and
that
he
walked
very
slowly
leaning
upon
his
staff
the
men
and
women
drew
back
respectfully
as
he
advanced
and
stood
in
a
silent
waiting
circle
while
he
shaded
his
eyes
and
gazed
long
at
the
ships
now
growing
smaller
in
the
distance
are
they
friends
or
enemies
secotan
one
of
the
hunters
ventured
to
ask
but
the
medicine
man
replied
only
that
must
be
as
the
gods
decree
then
destroy
them
for
us
cried
the
old
squaw
grandmother
call
up
a
storm
that
will
break
their
wings
and
shatter
the
sides
of
those
giant
canoes
bring
wind
and
rain
and
thunder
and
all
the
spirits
of
the
sea
to
overwhelm
them
there
was
a
breathless
silence
as
secotan
slowly
moved
forward
and
raised
his
staff
nashola
standing
before
the
other
boys
watched
the
medicine
man
face
with
eyes
that
never
wavered
even
as
the
sorcerer
moved
there
came
a
low
mutter
of
thunder
across
the
gray
level
floor
of
the
sea
and
a
distant
streak
of
darker
water
showed
the
coming
wind
there
is
the
storm
the
very
winds
obey
him
the
cry
went
up
from
all
the
indians
save
only
nashola
who
stood
silent
the
medicine
man
turned
to
look
at
him
then
hesitated
and
dropped
his
eyes
why
do
you
wait
raise
up
a
hurricane
o
greatest
of
sorcerers
cried
a
man
behind
them
no
shouted
secotan
suddenly
he
flung
down
his
staff
and
held
up
his
empty
hands
before
his
face
i
will
raise
no
storm
he
cried
i
will
call
no
spirits
from
the
deep
because
i
can
not
the
wind
and
thunder
answer
no
man
bidding
storms
come
and
go
at
the
will
of
the
great
spirit
alone
there
is
one
soul
here
that
i
love
one
being
whom
in
all
my
life
i
have
had
for
a
friend
in
his
eyes
i
will
stand
for
truth
at
last
although
i
had
almost
learned
to
believe
in
my
magic
myself
i
can
do
none
of
those
things
that
you
think
i
am
a
man
without
power
like
every
one
of
you
a
roar
of
anger
went
up
a
dull
savage
guttural
sound
that
died
away
almost
at
once
into
silence
a
quiet
more
ominous
than
an
outcry
could
have
been
terrified
by
that
strange
apparition
out
yonder
upon
the
waters
the
indians
saw
themselves
deserted
by
the
one
person
to
whom
they
could
look
for
courage
and
counsel
only
half
understanding
they
knew
at
least
that
nashola
had
been
the
means
of
their
medicine
man
downfall
frenzied
hands
seized
them
both
and
dragged
them
headlong
down
toward
the
water
visions
of
the
savage
tortures
that
his
people
wreaked
upon
their
enemies
passed
through
the
boy
mind
but
he
did
not
struggle
or
cry
out
although
secotan
set
face
beside
him
turned
gray
under
its
coppery
skin
some
one
had
found
nashola
canoe
left
long
unused
upon
the
beach
and
had
launched
it
in
the
breakers
let
him
go
back
to
the
sea
that
he
loved
this
boy
who
has
never
been
one
of
us
let
the
man
perish
in
the
storm
that
is
coming
without
his
call
relentless
hands
flung
them
into
the
frail
boat
and
pushed
it
out
through
the
surf
nashola
crawled
to
the
stern
and
took
up
the
paddle
a
crash
of
thunder
broke
over
their
heads
and
a
wild
flare
of
lightning
lit
the
dark
water
as
he
dipped
the
blade
in
a
moment
rain
was
falling
in
blinding
sheets
the
wind
and
spray
were
roaring
in
their
ears
and
the
ebbing
tide
was
carrying
them
away
out
of
the
harbor
past
the
rocky
island
straight
to
the
open
angry
sea
after
a
long
time
secotan
who
had
lain
inert
where
he
had
been
thrown
into
the
boat
got
to
his
knees
and
took
up
the
second
paddle
only
by
keeping
the
little
boat
bow
to
the
wind
could
immediate
destruction
be
averted
but
the
medicine
man
strokes
were
feeble
affording
little
help
and
at
last
he
laid
down
the
blade
it
is
of
no
use
nashola
he
said
death
rides
on
the
wind
and
snatches
at
us
from
the
black
waters
lay
down
your
paddle
and
let
us
die
no
the
boy
answered
even
though
death
is
not
an
hour
away
we
will
fight
it
until
the
very
end
darkness
shut
down
about
them
so
that
they
could
scarcely
see
each
other
as
they
went
on
in
silence
although
each
combing
rush
of
water
seemed
certain
to
overwhelm
them
there
was
a
strange
exhilaration
a
mad
thrill
in
rising
to
every
giant
wave
and
shooting
down
its
green
side
in
a
cloud
of
spray
one
two
three
each
one
seemed
the
last
and
yet
there
were
ever
more
nashola
arms
were
numb
and
heavy
his
head
reeled
but
still
he
struggled
on
he
wished
at
last
that
death
would
come
quickly
to
still
the
terrible
aching
weariness
that
possessed
his
whole
being
the
worst
of
the
storm
had
blown
roaring
past
them
but
the
seas
were
still
heavy
and
nothing
nothing
nashola
thought
could
ever
bring
back
the
strength
to
his
failing
arms
suddenly
the
clouds
were
torn
apart
showing
a
glimmer
of
stars
and
a
vague
glimpse
of
the
tossing
black
water
all
about
them
look
look
nashola
cried
the
medicine
man
pointing
upward
they
have
come
to
help
us
your
kinsmen
the
seven
brothers
of
the
sun
but
nashola
was
not
looking
at
the
sky
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
a
ghostly
shape
moving
close
ahead
of
them
and
on
the
fitful
gleam
of
a
ship
lantern
that
tossed
and
glimmered
in
the
dark
dropping
his
paddle
he
put
his
hands
to
his
mouth
and
lifted
his
voice
in
a
long
hail
the
light
bobbed
and
swung
and
an
answering
shout
came
through
the
darkness
to
the
english
sailors
used
to
the
rough
adventures
of
sailing
new
and
uncharted
seas
there
was
little
excitement
in
picking
up
two
indians
although
they
had
never
done
such
a
thing
before
they
warmed
the
two
with
blankets
they
revived
them
with
fiery
remedies
and
they
sat
about
them
on
the
deck
trying
to
talk
to
them
by
means
of
signs
but
with
small
success
it
is
no
common
thing
to
see
these
natives
so
far
from
shore
the
mate
said
to
the
captain
for
as
a
rule
the
indians
distrust
the
sea
we
can
not
find
out
how
these
came
to
be
adrift
in
that
canoe
the
young
one
tries
to
make
us
understand
but
the
old
man
merely
covers
his
face
and
groans
i
think
he
will
not
believe
that
we
are
men
like
himself
bring
the
boy
to
me
the
captain
ordered
perhaps
we
may
be
able
to
understand
him
in
the
quiet
dawn
when
calm
had
followed
the
night
storm
the
ship
ran
in
toward
a
rocky
headland
to
send
a
boat
ashore
yet
when
it
had
been
lowered
and
secotan
had
dropped
into
it
he
turned
to
see
nashola
standing
on
the
deck
above
making
no
move
to
follow
i
am
not
coming
secotan
he
declared
steadily
the
chief
of
these
men
and
i
have
talked
with
signs
and
he
wishes
to
carry
me
to
his
home
on
this
strange
winged
vessel
he
promises
that
he
will
bring
me
safe
back
again
then
i
can
tell
you
and
all
of
our
tribe
what
these
white
men
really
are
and
i
have
always
longed
to
know
what
lay
beyond
this
forbidden
sea
secotan
did
not
protest
i
have
called
you
friend
i
have
wished
to
have
you
for
my
brother
he
said
but
i
must
call
you
master
now
since
you
have
dared
what
i
can
never
dare
much
has
been
said
of
the
courage
of
those
white
men
who
crossed
the
stormy
atlantic
in
their
little
vessels
to
explore
an
unknown
continent
but
what
of
the
brave
hearts
of
those
indians
who
thought
the
white
men
were
spirits
come
out
of
the
sea
who
did
not
know
what
ships
were
yet
who
still
dared
to
set
sail
with
them
for
we
know
that
there
were
such
dusky
voyagers
that
they
crossed
the
sea
more
than
once
in
the
english
fishing
vessels
and
that
they
brought
back
to
their
own
people
almost
unbelievable
tales
of
cities
and
palaces
or
harbors
crowded
with
shipping
and
of
whole
countrysides
covered
with
green
tilled
fields
with
all
these
wonders
however
they
could
tell
their
comrades
that
these
white
beings
were
mere
men
like
themselves
to
be
neither
hated
nor
dreaded
as
spirits
of
another
world
deep
dwelling
in
nashola
was
that
born
leadership
that
makes
real
men
see
through
the
doubts
and
terrors
of
their
race
who
can
distinguish
the
false
from
the
true
who
can
go
forward
through
shadowy
perils
to
the
clear
light
of
knowledge
and
success
it
was
in
recognition
of
this
that
old
secotan
half
understanding
wholly
unable
to
put
his
feeling
into
words
standing
alone
upon
the
headland
raised
his
arms
in
reverent
salute
and
cried
a
last
to
his
comrade
farewell
and
good
fortune
o
brother
of
the
sun
chapter
iii
john
massey
landlord
the
story
had
come
to
an
end
but
the
boy
and
girl
still
waited
as
though
to
hear
more
but
do
oak
trees
grow
to
be
so
old
oliver
inquired
at
last
looking
out
at
the
moving
shadow
of
the
great
tree
that
had
now
covered
the
doorstone
yes
three
hundred
years
is
no
impossible
age
for
an
oak
all
the
old
grants
of
land
speak
of
an
oak
tree
on
this
hill
as
one
of
the
landmarks
how
did
you
know
began
oliver
and
then
broke
off
with
a
sudden
jerk
of
recollection
oh
i
forgot
all
about
it
my
train
he
snatched
out
his
watch
and
stood
regarding
it
with
a
rueful
face
he
had
missed
the
train
by
more
than
half
an
hour
were
you
going
away
asked
polly
sympathetically
we
are
always
missing
trains
like
that
daddy
and
i
wo
they
be
surprised
to
see
you
come
back
they
they
did
know
i
was
going
returned
oliver
they
are
wondering
now
where
i
am
he
was
too
much
agitated
to
keep
from
doing
his
thinking
out
loud
i
must
be
getting
back
thank
you
for
the
story
he
was
gone
before
they
could
say
more
leaving
polly
in
fact
with
her
mouth
open
to
speak
and
with
the
beeman
looking
after
him
with
an
amused
and
quizzical
grin
as
though
he
recognized
the
symptoms
of
an
uneasy
conscience
we
never
asked
him
to
come
again
polly
lamented
to
which
her
father
answered
i
believe
he
will
come
just
the
same
the
smooth
machinery
of
cousin
jasper
house
must
have
been
thrown
out
of
gear
for
a
moment
when
the
car
came
round
to
the
door
and
oliver
failed
to
appear
it
was
running
quietly
and
noiselessly
again
however
by
the
time
he
returned
janet
was
curled
up
in
a
big
armchair
in
the
library
enjoying
a
book
when
he
came
in
she
looked
up
at
him
rather
curiously
but
only
said
eleanor
brighton
mother
telephoned
at
half
past
three
that
eleanor
had
been
detained
somewhere
she
did
quite
know
where
she
was
very
apologetic
and
hoped
we
would
come
some
other
time
i
walked
down
the
road
to
look
for
you
but
you
were
in
sight
i
met
such
a
strange
man
coming
in
at
the
gate
he
turned
all
the
way
around
on
the
seat
of
his
cart
to
stare
at
me
i
did
like
him
she
did
not
press
oliver
with
questions
and
as
a
result
he
sat
down
beside
her
and
told
her
the
whole
tale
of
his
afternoon
adventures
with
a
glowing
description
of
the
beeman
and
polly
i
must
take
you
there
to
see
them
he
said
i
ca
wait
to
show
you
how
things
look
from
that
hill
and
you
should
see
the
bees
and
the
little
house
and
hear
the
wind
in
the
big
tree
we
will
go
when
cousin
jasper
appeared
for
dinner
oliver
felt
somewhat
apprehensive
but
to
his
relief
no
questions
were
asked
him
their
cousin
listened
rather
absently
while
janet
explained
why
the
proposed
visit
had
not
been
made
and
he
offered
no
comment
he
looked
paler
even
than
usual
with
deeper
lines
in
his
face
and
he
sat
at
the
end
of
the
long
table
saying
little
and
eating
less
afterward
he
sat
with
them
in
the
library
still
restless
and
uneasy
and
speaking
only
now
and
then
in
jerking
sentences
that
they
could
scarcely
follow
it
was
an
evident
relief
to
all
three
of
them
when
the
time
came
to
say
good
night
oliver
looked
back
anxiously
over
his
shoulder
as
their
cousin
returned
to
his
study
and
as
they
at
the
other
end
of
the
long
room
went
out
into
the
hall
something
has
happened
to
upset
him
more
than
usual
he
said
do
you
think
he
could
have
guessed
what
i
intended
to
do
janet
shook
her
head
emphatically
he
could
have
guessed
she
declared
even
now
i
can
hardly
believe
it
of
you
myself
oliver
oliver
rather
ashamed
was
beginning
to
wonder
at
himself
also
they
had
fallen
into
the
habit
of
going
upstairs
early
to
the
comfortable
sitting
room
into
which
their
bedrooms
opened
it
was
their
own
domain
a
pleasant
breezy
place
with
deep
wicker
chairs
gay
chintz
curtains
flower
boxes
and
wide
casements
opening
on
a
balcony
they
had
both
found
some
rare
treasures
among
the
books
downstairs
and
liked
to
carry
them
away
for
an
hour
of
enjoyment
before
it
was
bedtime
oliver
settled
himself
comfortably
beside
a
window
opened
his
book
but
did
not
immediately
begin
to
read
his
eyes
wandered
about
the
perfectly
appointed
room
stared
out
at
the
moonlit
garden
and
then
came
back
to
his
sister
why
are
we
happy
here
janet
he
questioned
it
seems
as
though
we
had
everything
to
make
us
so
because
he
is
happy
returned
his
sister
with
a
gesture
toward
the
study
where
cousin
jasper
distraught
worried
and
forlorn
must
even
then
be
sitting
alone
but
why
is
he
happy
there
is
everything
here
that
he
could
wish
for
oliver
added
somewhat
bitterly
after
a
pause
why
people
tell
us
things
it
is
miserable
to
be
old
enough
to
notice
when
affairs
go
wrong
but
not
to
be
old
enough
to
have
them
explained
perhaps
said
janet
hopefully
we
will
be
able
to
prove
that
we
deserve
to
know
i
think
that
you
will
anyway
and
then
you
can
tell
me
it
was
not
only
the
younger
members
of
the
household
who
were
struggling
with
mystery
that
night
however
before
they
had
been
reading
many
minutes
there
came
a
discreet
tap
at
the
door
and
hotchkiss
appeared
upon
the
threshold
oliver
was
wondering
what
a
boy
unused
to
butlers
was
supposed
to
say
or
do
on
the
occasion
of
such
a
visit
and
even
janet
better
at
guessing
the
etiquette
of
such
matters
seemed
at
a
loss
and
so
also
was
hotchkiss
as
it
presently
began
to
be
evident
if
the
butler
had
been
of
the
regulation
variety
he
might
perhaps
have
known
how
to
ask
a
few
respectful
questions
without
a
change
of
his
professional
countenance
and
have
gained
his
information
without
betraying
its
significance
but
as
it
was
he
had
for
the
moment
put
off
the
wooden
expressionless
face
that
he
was
supposed
to
wear
at
his
work
and
was
openly
anxious
and
disturbed
we
troubled
about
peyton
brown
and
i
he
began
coming
frankly
to
the
point
at
once
he
had
a
queer
visitor
one
who
has
just
been
coming
lately
and
who
always
leaves
him
upset
i
wonder
if
you
saw
him
a
thin
man
with
a
brown
face
and
a
kind
of
a
way
with
him
somehow
in
spite
of
his
bad
clothes
did
he
drive
a
shambling
old
horse
inquired
oliver
remembering
suddenly
the
person
he
had
noticed
on
the
road
and
a
wagon
that
rattled
as
though
it
were
twenty
years
old
yes
we
both
saw
him
had
you
ever
seen
him
before
hotchkiss
asked
eagerly
and
seemed
disappointed
when
oliver
replied
no
we
had
never
laid
eyes
on
him
before
it
is
just
in
the
last
few
weeks
that
he
has
been
coming
here
so
often
the
man
went
on
before
that
he
came
rarely
and
we
think
so
much
about
him
i
can
remember
the
first
time
i
saw
him
soon
after
i
had
come
to
peyton
a
year
ago
the
fellow
rang
the
bell
as
bold
as
anything
but
when
i
saw
that
rickety
outfit
drawn
up
to
the
steps
i
was
about
to
tell
him
that
the
other
entrance
was
the
place
for
him
he
must
have
read
my
eye
he
a
sharp
one
for
he
said
master
wo
thank
you
for
turning
me
away
when
i
a
member
of
the
family
and
sure
enough
there
was
peyton
behind
me
in
the
hall
telling
me
to
bring
him
in
he
was
nervous
and
put
out
with
everybody
after
the
man
was
gone
and
he
is
more
and
more
upset
each
time
he
comes
and
the
fellow
begins
to
come
often
i
thought
that
if
he
was
a
member
of
the
family
you
might
know
who
he
was
and
how
we
could
get
rid
of
him
the
heat
of
the
last
words
put
an
end
to
any
possible
thought
that
the
man
questions
were
prompted
by
a
servant
unwarranted
curiosity
concerning
his
master
it
was
plain
that
cousin
jasper
was
a
employer
and
that
the
two
chief
persons
of
his
household
had
been
laying
their
heads
together
over
the
mystery
of
his
evident
trouble
hotchkiss
was
about
to
tell
them
more
when
a
bell
sounding
below
summoned
him
away
there
was
an
interval
during
which
they
tried
to
return
to
their
books
but
found
their
minds
occupied
with
thoughts
of
what
the
butler
had
said
who
could
this
man
be
whom
they
had
both
noticed
and
both
set
down
as
odious
and
whose
coming
seemed
to
have
such
an
unhappy
effect
upon
cousin
jasper
a
relative
it
did
not
seem
possible
presently
hotchkiss
was
at
the
door
again
more
troubled
than
ever
peyton
wants
the
motor
but
it
jennings
evening
off
and
he
has
gone
to
town
he
said
did
i
hear
you
tell
him
oliver
that
you
knew
how
to
drive
that
make
of
car
oliver
had
indeed
dropped
such
a
hint
two
days
before
hoping
that
the
dullness
of
his
visit
might
be
lightened
by
his
being
invited
to
take
the
car
out
for
a
spin
the
statement
had
fallen
on
quite
unheeding
ears
in
cousin
jasper
case
but
had
been
treasured
up
by
the
butler
yes
i
can
drive
it
agreed
oliver
rather
doubting
whether
cousin
jasper
would
really
desire
him
as
a
chauffeur
he
got
up
and
went
downstairs
to
find
his
cousin
waiting
in
the
hall
so
nervous
and
impatient
that
he
made
no
other
comment
than
we
must
make
haste
oliver
hurried
out
to
the
garage
backed
out
the
heavy
car
paused
under
the
portico
for
cousin
jasper
to
climb
in
beside
him
and
sped
away
down
the
drive
which
way
he
asked
as
they
came
out
through
the
gate
and
was
directed
along
the
road
he
had
followed
that
afternoon
you
may
go
as
fast
as
you
like
i
am
in
a
hurry
was
cousin
unexpected
permission
so
that
oliver
nothing
loath
let
out
the
car
to
its
full
speed
it
was
very
dark
for
the
moon
had
gone
under
a
cloud
the
road
showing
vaguely
white
through
the
blackness
was
nearly
empty
and
the
tree
trunks
flashed
by
looking
unreal
in
the
glare
of
the
lamps
like
the
cardboard
trees
of
a
scene
on
the
stage
the
big
car
hummed
and
the
wind
sang
in
oliver
ears
but
for
only
the
briefest
moment
for
they
seemed
to
come
immediately
to
a
crossroad
where
cousin
jasper
bade
him
turn
a
slower
pace
was
necessary
here
for
the
going
was
rough
and
uneven
yet
not
so
difficult
as
that
of
the
narrower
lane
in
which
they
presently
found
themselves
here
the
machine
lurched
among
the
deep
ruts
rustled
through
high
grass
and
trees
and
finally
came
to
a
stop
before
a
gate
no
wait
here
directed
cousin
jasper
as
oliver
made
a
move
to
get
out
i
shall
not
be
gone
very
long
he
climbed
out
and
jerked
at
the
gate
which
one
hinge
being
gone
opened
reluctantly
to
let
him
pass
he
stalked
away
a
tall
awkward
figure
in
the
brilliant
shaft
of
light
from
the
lamps
walking
with
a
fierce
determined
dignity
up
the
path
that
disappeared
into
the
dark
oliver
felt
a
sudden
rush
of
pity
for
him
and
of
shame
that
he
had
so
nearly
deserted
him
it
must
be
hard
he
thought
to
be
so
miserable
and
anxious
and
to
have
no
one
to
talk
it
over
with
and
i
do
wonder
what
is
the
matter
he
waited
an
hour
and
another
he
had
dimmed
his
lamps
and
could
see
vaguely
the
outline
of
a
house
with
one
dull
light
in
a
window
a
dog
barked
somewhere
beyond
the
gate
and
presently
a
child
began
crying
it
cried
a
very
long
time
then
at
last
was
quiet
but
still
no
one
came
oliver
fell
asleep
finally
against
the
comfortable
leather
cushions
and
slumbered
he
knew
not
how
long
before
he
was
aroused
by
the
protesting
creak
of
the
broken
gate
he
thought
as
he
was
waking
that
a
man
voice
with
anger
was
talking
in
the
dark
but
when
he
had
rubbed
the
sleep
from
his
eyes
he
saw
no
one
but
cousin
jasper
i
had
not
thought
it
would
be
so
long
was
all
his
cousin
said
as
he
got
in
and
after
that
there
was
no
word
spoken
until
they
entered
their
own
gate
and
rolled
up
to
the
door
you
drive
well
for
a
boy
good
night
said
cousin
jasper
as
he
climbed
out
and
entered
the
house
in
his
hurried
awkward
way
he
was
attempting
to
express
his
gratitude
but
he
had
managed
to
say
the
wrong
thing
for
a
boy
indeed
snorted
oliver
as
he
guided
the
car
into
the
door
of
the
garage
and
repeated
it
as
he
went
up
the
stairs
to
his
room
for
a
boy
the
big
clock
in
the
hall
was
solemnly
striking
one
oliver
was
wondering
as
he
came
down
to
breakfast
next
morning
what
his
cousin
would
say
in
explanation
of
their
midnight
expedition
but
discovered
that
cousin
jasper
had
adopted
the
simple
expedient
of
saying
nothing
at
all
the
matter
was
not
even
referred
to
until
just
as
they
were
leaving
the
table
and
then
only
indirectly
i
should
have
thought
of
it
before
their
host
said
that
it
might
give
you
some
pleasure
to
take
out
the
car
use
it
every
day
if
you
wish
and
take
jennings
or
not
just
as
it
suits
you
i
have
real
confidence
in
your
driving
oliver
it
was
surprising
how
completely
matters
were
put
upon
another
footing
by
what
he
had
said
if
cousin
jasper
had
confidence
in
him
oliver
thought
he
need
no
longer
feel
like
a
neglected
outsider
one
who
was
of
no
use
or
worth
in
the
household
get
your
hat
janet
he
urged
promptly
he
had
not
an
instant
hesitation
in
deciding
where
they
would
go
first
just
as
cousin
jasper
was
entering
his
study
he
turned
back
to
say
now
about
your
cousin
eleanor
but
oliver
either
did
not
or
would
not
hear
as
he
sped
away
toward
the
garage
perhaps
cousin
jasper
understood
the
smile
that
janet
gave
him
for
he
smiled
himself
and
said
no
more
in
the
very
shortest
time
possible
oliver
and
janet
were
bowling
along
the
smooth
white
road
with
all
the
blue
and
golden
sunlight
of
a
cool
june
morning
about
them
oliver
laughed
when
he
thought
of
his
dusty
progress
along
that
way
the
day
before
there
was
little
danger
of
his
running
away
now
for
the
dreaded
cousin
eleanor
was
quite
forgotten
and
he
was
certain
that
the
time
would
not
pass
slowly
since
he
had
acquired
this
splendid
new
plaything
he
wondered
as
the
highway
spun
away
beneath
the
swift
wheels
which
of
the
crossroads
that
he
passed
was
the
one
that
he
had
traveled
the
evening
before
but
the
night
had
been
so
dark
and
their
speed
so
great
that
he
was
quite
unable
to
decide
it
was
only
after
exploring
a
good
many
of
medford
valley
lesser
thoroughfares
after
awkward
turns
in
narrow
byroads
that
proved
to
be
mere
blind
alleys
that
they
began
to
come
closer
and
closer
to
the
foot
of
the
hill
not
being
able
to
find
a
direct
path
oliver
finally
drew
up
beside
the
low
stone
wall
and
plunged
on
foot
through
the
high
grass
of
the
orchard
wait
until
i
see
if
they
are
here
he
instructed
janet
and
then
i
will
come
back
for
you
his
new
acquaintances
were
sitting
on
the
bench
beside
the
doorway
as
he
came
up
the
hill
polly
in
a
very
trim
blue
dress
and
without
her
apron
but
the
beeman
in
his
same
dilapidated
overalls
the
girl
had
a
notebook
on
her
knee
and
was
putting
down
records
at
her
dictation
here
is
our
friend
in
need
of
yesterday
said
the
beeman
cordially
as
oliver
came
up
the
path
but
we
ca
put
him
to
work
because
we
are
just
about
to
set
off
to
fetch
some
new
beehives
there
are
more
colonies
than
i
thought
that
need
dividing
and
i
find
i
am
out
of
hives
let
me
get
them
for
you
oliver
offered
at
once
and
explained
the
presence
of
his
sister
in
the
car
below
polly
can
go
with
you
to
show
you
the
way
the
beeman
agreed
willingly
john
massey
who
makes
our
hives
for
us
lives
a
good
many
miles
away
at
the
upper
end
of
medford
valley
i
shall
be
glad
to
save
the
time
of
going
myself
come
to
the
top
of
the
hill
so
that
i
can
point
out
the
direction
of
the
road
to
you
they
took
the
little
path
beyond
the
house
leading
upward
to
the
very
summit
of
the
hill
in
the
direction
from
which
oliver
had
come
up
the
gentler
incline
of
the
southern
slope
the
view
was
narrowed
by
the
woods
and
the
orchard
showing
only
the
long
vista
that
led
away
toward
the
high
ridge
opposite
and
the
blue
dip
of
shining
sea
on
the
eastern
face
of
the
hill
however
the
ground
fell
away
steeply
to
a
sweep
of
river
and
a
broad
stretch
of
green
farming
country
it
lays
below
like
a
vast
sunken
garden
with
great
square
fields
for
lawns
and
clumps
of
rounded
trees
for
shrubbery
the
of
wheat
and
the
of
oats
stretched
out
a
smooth
expanse
that
rippled
and
crinkled
as
the
wind
and
the
sweeping
shadow
of
a
cloud
went
slowly
down
the
valley
there
were
no
country
houses
of
magnificence
here
only
comfortable
farm
dwellings
with
wide
eaves
and
generous
barns
a
few
with
picturesque
pointed
silos
and
slim
windmills
most
of
that
farming
land
belongs
to
your
cousin
jasper
the
beeman
said
while
oliver
too
intent
upon
staring
at
the
view
below
him
failed
to
wonder
how
he
happened
to
know
so
much
of
their
affairs
that
whole
portion
of
the
valley
was
waste
swampy
ground
at
one
time
it
was
an
uncle
of
jasper
peyton
who
drained
the
land
thirty
years
ago
and
built
dikes
to
keep
the
river
back
he
arranged
to
rent
it
out
to
tenant
farmers
for
he
said
one
man
should
own
the
whole
to
keep
up
the
dikes
and
see
that
the
stream
did
not
come
creeping
in
again
medford
river
looks
lazy
and
sleepy
enough
but
it
can
be
a
raging
demon
when
the
rains
are
heavy
and
the
water
comes
up
your
cousin
owns
all
of
it
still
except
for
a
portion
up
there
at
the
bend
of
the
stream
that
has
passed
out
of
his
hands
lately
it
is
at
the
far
end
on
the
last
farm
that
john
massey
lives
oliver
from
this
vantage
point
could
pick
out
the
intricate
succession
of
lanes
and
highroad
that
he
must
take
to
cross
the
river
and
reach
john
massey
place
showing
from
here
as
only
a
dot
of
a
gray
house
at
the
angle
of
the
stream
the
sunshine
was
very
clear
and
hot
over
the
valley
below
but
the
oak
tree
spread
its
broad
shadow
all
about
them
and
bowed
its
lofty
head
to
a
fresh
wind
see
how
still
the
trees
are
along
the
river
said
the
beeman
but
the
oak
tree
is
never
quiet
the
breeze
comes
past
that
gap
in
the
hills
yonder
where
you
can
look
through
to
the
sea
and
it
seems
never
to
stop
blowing
so
we
call
this
place
the
windy
hill
the
three
set
off
on
their
errand
very
gayly
in
the
big
car
although
polly
and
janet
in
the
back
seat
together
were
a
little
shy
and
silent
at
the
very
first
at
the
end
of
a
mile
however
they
were
beginning
to
warm
toward
each
other
and
had
set
up
a
brisk
chatter
before
they
had
gone
three
i
knew
janet
would
like
polly
oliver
was
thinking
she
is
the
sort
of
girl
i
like
myself
not
like
cousin
eleanor
the
kind
that
makes
you
feel
that
your
clothes
and
your
manners
are
all
wrong
and
that
you
have
anything
to
say
those
are
the
girls
i
ca
stand
he
quite
forgot
that
this
harsh
judgment
of
his
unknown
relative
was
not
based
upon
any
real
evidence
when
they
reached
the
floor
of
the
valley
they
found
it
as
level
as
a
table
with
a
straight
road
running
from
end
to
end
along
which
they
sped
in
a
whirling
cloud
of
dust
other
cars
passed
them
driven
by
prosperous
farmers
the
growl
and
clatter
of
motor
tractors
sounded
from
the
fields
on
either
hand
halfway
up
the
valley
the
character
of
the
places
seemed
to
change
the
houses
had
the
look
of
needing
paint
the
weeds
were
taller
along
the
fences
and
there
were
no
silos
nor
tractors
to
be
seen
as
they
neared
john
massey
house
the
road
came
close
to
the
river
with
the
high
bank
of
earth
that
was
the
dike
rising
at
their
left
as
they
drove
along
they
were
obliged
to
stop
where
some
horses
were
walking
in
the
road
ahead
of
them
and
seemed
slow
in
making
way
the
big
gray
and
brown
creatures
were
dragging
huge
flat
stones
each
hooked
to
the
traces
with
an
iron
chain
scuffling
and
scraping
along
in
the
dust
i
sorry
said
the
sunburned
man
who
drove
the
last
team
looking
back
to
where
the
car
waited
in
the
road
we
make
room
in
a
minute
but
the
horses
are
doing
all
they
can
we
are
in
no
hurry
responded
oliver
where
are
you
taking
the
stones
and
what
are
they
for
to
mend
the
dike
quite
a
way
downstream
it
takes
a
lot
of
patching
to
keep
banks
like
these
whole
and
strong
but
they
guard
some
valuable
land
the
dike
looks
as
though
it
needed
repairs
up
here
at
this
end
but
nobody
does
much
to
it
peyton
has
us
go
over
his
section
of
the
banks
every
year
the
horses
moved
forward
leaving
room
for
them
to
pass
and
the
car
went
on
john
massey
house
was
the
last
one
at
the
end
of
the
road
a
little
place
with
a
roof
that
needed
new
shingles
and
with
sagging
steps
leading
up
to
the
door
oliver
with
some
difficulty
squeezed
the
big
car
through
the
gate
and
followed
the
rutty
driveway
to
the
open
space
behind
the
house
there
was
a
stretch
of
grass
a
well
two
straggling
apple
trees
and
a
row
of
beehives
an
inquisitive
cow
came
to
the
gate
of
the
barnyard
and
thrust
her
head
over
it
to
stare
at
them
with
the
frank
curiosity
of
a
country
lady
who
sees
little
of
strangers
here
is
john
massey
said
polly
as
a
rather
shabby
man
with
kindly
blue
eyes
came
out
of
one
of
the
barns
my
father
gave
him
some
of
these
beehives
and
taught
him
how
to
make
new
ones
he
is
very
clever
at
it
and
it
means
a
good
deal
to
him
to
make
ours
for
he
is
very
poor
he
works
very
hard
on
his
farm
but
it
never
seems
to
be
much
of
a
success
the
hives
were
brought
out
and
paid
for
and
stowed
in
the
back
of
the
car
oliver
was
just
making
ready
for
the
somewhat
difficult
feat
of
backing
the
car
around
in
the
narrow
space
between
house
and
barn
when
there
came
a
rattling
of
wheels
through
the
gate
and
a
loud
rasping
voice
was
heard
calling
for
john
massey
that
anthony
crawford
said
the
farmer
who
had
been
standing
by
the
car
admiring
wistfully
its
shining
sides
and
heavy
tires
he
owns
this
place
and
he
comes
up
here
nearly
every
day
to
see
how
farming
it
i
do
accomplish
much
with
him
always
around
to
give
me
sharp
words
and
never
a
dollar
for
improvements
i
told
him
a
hundred
times
that
the
dike
ought
to
be
looked
after
this
year
or
we
be
having
a
flood
but
he
always
says
he
guesses
it
will
hold
yes
sir
i
coming
the
calls
had
grown
too
loud
to
be
disregarded
although
it
was
plain
that
john
massey
was
in
no
haste
to
obey
the
summons
in
a
moment
the
owner
of
the
voice
came
jingling
and
rattling
around
the
corner
of
the
house
the
same
man
that
oliver
had
met
on
the
road
driving
the
same
bony
horse
whoa
there
whoa
cried
the
driver
for
the
old
white
steed
had
caught
sight
of
the
car
and
was
testifying
to
its
dislike
of
it
by
grotesque
prancings
and
sidlings
that
threatened
to
wreck
the
ramshackle
trap
here
get
out
of
my
way
he
ordered
oliver
that
is
if
you
know
how
to
handle
that
snorting
locomotive
that
you
think
you
driving
red
with
anger
oliver
started
his
engine
and
embarked
upon
a
maneuver
that
was
difficult
at
best
and
under
the
present
unfavorable
circumstances
proved
to
be
nearly
impossible
he
turned
the
car
half
round
collided
with
a
pigsty
backed
into
the
barnyard
fence
and
narrowly
missed
taking
a
wheel
off
anthony
decrepit
wagon
that
gentleman
assisted
the
process
with
jeering
remarks
and
criticisms
while
oliver
grew
redder
and
redder
with
fury
and
embarrassment
at
last
however
the
car
was
turned
and
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
driveway
facing
the
white
horse
which
seemed
to
have
resigned
itself
to
the
presence
of
the
puffing
monster
and
to
be
very
reluctant
to
move
i
have
got
out
of
your
way
now
will
you
be
good
enough
to
get
out
of
mine
said
oliver
very
slowly
lest
the
rage
within
him
should
break
out
into
open
insult
in
spite
of
his
anger
he
could
not
help
noticing
that
the
man
before
him
moved
with
a
curious
easy
grace
and
that
when
he
smiled
with
a
white
flash
of
teeth
he
was
almost
attractive
it
was
impossible
to
deny
that
except
for
his
thin
lips
and
his
hard
gray
eyes
he
was
handsome
he
must
be
about
cousin
jasper
age
oliver
thought
as
he
sat
looking
at
him
while
the
other
stared
in
return
i
should
like
to
pass
the
boy
persisted
since
the
other
made
no
move
so
you
shall
oliver
peyton
returned
the
man
only
expect
me
to
move
as
fast
or
as
gracefully
as
you
did
you
wonder
how
i
know
your
name
i
suppose
well
if
that
precious
cousin
jasper
of
yours
and
mine
were
a
little
more
outspoken
about
his
affairs
you
would
know
all
about
me
if
you
want
to
know
where
i
live
just
look
over
the
back
wall
of
your
cousin
garden
do
it
some
time
when
he
is
looking
for
he
does
love
to
think
of
what
lies
behind
that
wall
where
the
fruit
trees
are
trained
so
prettily
and
where
the
trees
and
shrubs
grow
so
high
he
had
made
way
at
last
and
the
car
moved
forward
but
he
turned
to
shout
a
last
bitter
word
after
them
if
you
want
to
know
one
of
your
cousin
jasper
meanest
secrets
look
over
the
wall
chapter
iv
the
garden
wall
it
was
very
early
when
oliver
rolled
out
of
bed
next
day
sleepy
but
determined
he
had
decided
at
first
to
pay
no
attention
to
anthony
crawford
suggestion
made
evidently
with
malicious
purpose
he
had
indeed
almost
forgotten
it
by
the
time
he
and
janet
reached
home
but
janet
had
remembered
and
she
had
brought
up
the
question
that
evening
as
they
went
up
to
their
own
quarters
rather
later
than
usual
since
cousin
jasper
had
been
sitting
with
them
in
the
library
and
had
seemed
unwilling
that
they
should
leave
him
there
is
something
very
wrong
in
this
house
declared
janet
hotchkiss
does
know
what
it
is
brown
does
i
think
the
beeman
knows
oliver
volunteered
suddenly
although
he
could
give
no
reason
for
his
guess
anyway
pursued
janet
some
one
ought
to
know
for
some
one
ought
to
help
cousin
jasper
i
am
certain
that
he
has
no
mean
secrets
as
anthony
crawford
said
and
so
i
think
one
of
us
should
climb
up
and
look
over
the
wall
it
had
better
be
you
she
added
wisely
but
regretfully
because
if
we
both
try
it
some
one
is
sure
to
see
us
it
was
therefore
oliver
who
was
stirring
at
sunrise
for
his
investigations
must
be
made
before
any
one
else
was
up
he
let
himself
out
of
the
house
very
quietly
and
crossed
the
empty
silent
garden
he
had
forgotten
how
beautiful
a
garden
could
be
in
the
early
morning
with
the
dew
shining
on
every
grass
tip
and
with
the
flowers
all
radiant
in
the
vividness
of
color
of
newly
created
things
there
were
beds
below
the
terrace
and
long
borders
at
each
side
of
the
house
then
a
wide
stretch
of
grass
behind
the
garage
and
beyond
that
back
of
the
shrubs
and
the
fruit
trees
and
the
thickly
growing
vines
was
the
wall
it
was
higher
than
the
boundaries
at
the
sides
and
front
of
cousin
jasper
place
perhaps
to
afford
a
better
surface
for
the
grapevines
and
pear
trees
trained
against
it
perhaps
for
another
reason
oliver
walked
along
it
slowly
looking
up
at
the
smooth
bricks
and
wondering
how
it
was
to
be
climbed
the
more
difficult
it
appeared
the
more
determined
he
became
to
get
to
the
top
in
the
middle
of
the
wall
behind
a
summerhouse
stood
a
stout
trellis
the
support
of
an
exceedingly
thorny
rose
vine
here
he
decided
was
the
place
to
scramble
up
but
he
must
make
haste
for
people
in
the
house
would
be
waking
and
would
see
him
carefully
he
set
a
foot
upon
the
lowest
bar
found
that
it
would
hold
and
began
mounting
upward
there
were
trees
beyond
the
wall
not
the
trimmed
kind
that
grew
in
cousin
jasper
garden
but
a
scrubby
growth
of
box
elder
and
poplar
such
as
spring
up
in
myriads
where
the
grass
is
never
cut
hanging
over
the
top
of
the
coping
he
could
peer
through
their
branches
and
see
a
house
beyond
he
was
astonished
to
see
the
shingled
roof
rising
so
close
by
for
he
had
not
thought
that
they
had
neighbors
who
dwelt
so
near
the
house
was
a
square
one
of
yellow
stone
with
overhanging
eaves
and
small
windows
and
an
stoop
in
front
over
which
the
roof
came
down
in
a
long
sweep
it
must
have
been
built
a
hundred
years
ago
he
thought
and
it
might
have
seemed
a
charming
comfortable
old
place
were
it
not
so
unutterably
dejected
and
dingy
its
windows
were
cracked
the
grass
grew
tall
and
ragged
upon
its
lawns
a
litter
of
rubbish
lay
about
the
back
door
and
the
woodwork
that
should
have
been
white
was
gray
from
want
of
paint
it
looks
as
though
the
people
who
lived
in
it
just
did
care
oliver
commented
it
is
a
nice
old
house
but
it
seems
worn
out
and
discouraged
somehow
like
john
massey
cottage
i
wonder
who
owns
it
an
open
space
between
the
dwelling
and
the
wall
had
apparently
once
been
a
broad
lawn
then
had
been
plowed
up
for
the
planting
of
a
patch
of
grain
and
had
at
last
been
left
as
a
neglected
waste
for
weeds
and
brambles
to
flourish
undisturbed
an
old
scarecrow
still
stood
in
the
tangled
green
left
there
after
the
field
had
been
abandoned
to
drop
slowly
to
pieces
in
the
wind
and
rain
the
grotesque
figure
with
its
outstretched
arms
and
hat
set
at
a
rakish
angle
looked
familiar
for
some
incomprehensible
reason
as
oliver
clung
to
the
wall
squinted
through
the
leaves
and
wondered
why
that
should
be
the
mystery
was
suddenly
solved
the
door
of
the
house
opened
with
a
squeak
of
rusty
hinges
and
somebody
came
out
on
the
step
it
was
anthony
crawford
no
wonder
the
scarecrow
looked
like
its
master
for
it
was
wearing
his
old
clothes
garments
to
which
there
always
cling
a
vague
resemblance
to
the
person
who
once
wore
them
a
child
with
very
yellow
hair
came
running
out
upon
the
doorstone
laughing
aloud
at
some
small
joke
of
his
very
own
when
he
saw
anthony
crawford
however
he
sobered
suddenly
and
slipped
back
into
the
house
without
a
sound
the
man
stood
upon
the
step
and
stared
with
narrowed
penetrating
eyes
over
toward
the
wall
the
gables
and
chimneys
of
cousin
jasper
big
house
must
show
through
the
trees
from
where
he
stood
and
judging
by
the
look
with
which
he
regarded
them
it
seemed
that
he
hated
the
very
roof
that
sheltered
jasper
peyton
the
luxurious
mansion
was
in
truth
a
sharp
contrast
to
the
unkempt
yellow
farmhouse
although
oliver
wondered
whether
originally
the
old
stone
dwelling
had
not
been
the
more
attractive
of
the
two
he
leaned
forward
to
see
plainer
made
an
unwise
move
and
attracted
the
attention
of
the
man
on
the
step
the
boy
flushed
scarlet
as
their
eyes
met
for
anthony
crawford
without
making
a
sound
went
through
a
pantomime
of
an
ecstasy
of
glee
he
had
evidently
expected
to
arouse
oliver
curiosity
by
his
suggestion
the
day
before
and
was
overcome
with
delight
to
catch
him
in
the
very
act
of
satisfying
it
with
a
mutter
of
angry
words
oliver
dropped
back
into
the
garden
i
was
looking
just
because
he
told
me
to
i
he
kept
repeating
as
he
walked
toward
the
house
he
looked
back
more
than
once
at
the
high
wall
wondering
at
the
things
it
hid
here
was
squalid
poverty
almost
under
the
windows
of
the
great
handsome
house
where
cousin
jasper
lived
with
everything
that
heart
could
desire
it
was
the
poverty
too
of
a
member
of
his
own
family
here
was
jealous
enmity
also
a
hatred
that
seemed
to
point
ominously
to
trouble
before
them
to
all
the
harm
that
could
be
accomplished
by
an
angry
unscrupulous
man
no
wonder
cousin
jasper
looked
changed
and
haunted
what
hold
did
anthony
crawford
have
upon
his
cousin
why
should
one
have
so
little
and
the
other
so
much
why
did
that
high
wall
forbid
all
intercourse
with
that
strange
neighbor
it
was
plain
to
oliver
at
last
that
their
night
ride
through
lanes
and
crossroads
had
been
necessary
because
the
wall
cut
off
any
direct
path
and
that
the
goal
of
their
expedition
in
the
dark
had
been
anthony
crawford
sagging
gate
the
morning
sun
was
rising
higher
the
cheerful
sound
of
a
grass
cutter
was
going
up
and
down
the
garden
and
smoke
was
mounting
from
the
kitchen
chimney
with
some
care
lest
he
should
be
asked
the
cause
of
his
scratched
hands
and
torn
sleeve
oliver
slipped
into
the
house
and
sought
his
own
room
he
and
janet
talked
over
all
that
he
had
seen
but
they
could
make
little
of
it
and
were
indeed
more
mystified
than
ever
at
intervals
during
the
day
they
kept
coming
back
to
the
subject
and
were
still
talking
of
it
that
evening
as
they
sat
in
the
library
with
the
long
windows
open
upon
the
terrace
and
upon
the
flowering
garden
they
had
come
to
no
conclusion
however
when
the
study
door
opened
and
cousin
jasper
came
toward
them
across
the
hall
he
looked
less
troubled
and
was
smiling
as
though
he
had
been
looking
forward
to
this
hour
they
were
to
spend
together
yet
his
face
changed
in
a
moment
at
the
sound
of
rattling
wheels
on
the
drive
followed
by
the
appearance
of
a
troubled
hotchkiss
at
the
door
with
the
reluctant
question
will
you
see
crawford
sir
the
visitor
had
not
waited
but
came
pushing
in
behind
him
we
do
not
need
to
stand
on
ceremony
he
said
when
it
is
all
in
the
same
family
these
are
your
two
guests
eh
you
need
not
introduce
them
we
have
met
before
i
saw
the
boy
very
recently
in
fact
he
seems
to
be
an
enterprising
fellow
and
was
conducting
some
investigations
of
his
own
well
well
we
wo
talk
of
it
now
oliver
writhed
inwardly
under
his
sharp
glance
but
could
muster
no
appropriate
reply
he
was
thinking
again
that
anthony
crawford
might
have
been
handsome
except
for
those
restless
gray
eyes
that
were
set
too
near
together
although
his
host
was
obviously
anxious
to
lead
him
away
to
the
study
the
visitor
planted
himself
in
the
middle
of
the
library
floor
and
stood
his
ground
firmly
have
you
thought
over
my
offer
jasper
he
said
are
you
ready
to
give
me
my
share
or
shall
i
take
all
i
have
given
up
what
seemed
your
share
jasper
peyton
returned
steadily
and
rather
than
quarrel
with
you
further
i
would
gladly
give
you
all
but
i
believe
to
shut
one
eyes
to
justice
is
wrong
even
in
such
a
matter
as
this
the
other
calm
broke
suddenly
under
the
force
of
ungovernable
anger
you
will
be
sorry
he
cried
you
will
lose
more
than
those
fat
acres
by
the
river
and
this
fine
house
where
you
hoped
to
live
so
happily
until
i
came
you
wo
give
in
will
you
your
high
principles
or
your
stubbornness
will
still
hold
you
back
from
giving
me
what
is
mine
then
i
can
tell
you
that
i
will
drag
your
good
name
down
where
my
own
stands
i
will
publish
that
disgrace
of
mine
that
you
hushed
up
to
save
the
family
pride
you
will
have
people
looking
into
your
own
past
they
will
be
saying
one
of
the
family
was
crooked
why
not
another
there
is
always
a
pack
of
gossips
and
scandalmongers
who
are
only
too
glad
to
snap
at
the
heels
of
any
prominent
man
i
will
loose
them
all
upon
you
jasper
peyton
every
one
he
stopped
perhaps
to
draw
breath
while
cousin
jasper
stood
before
him
very
silent
and
very
white
the
man
narrow
eyes
turned
first
to
oliver
who
was
bursting
with
unexpressed
rage
and
then
to
janet
who
was
regarding
him
with
astonished
and
horrified
disapproval
you
do
not
like
my
way
of
talking
he
said
to
her
i
assure
you
that
all
i
have
said
is
the
truth
then
i
should
not
think
she
replied
bluntly
that
you
would
have
many
friends
if
you
often
tell
them
the
truth
in
just
that
way
i
have
no
friends
he
declared
friends
exist
only
to
hurt
you
it
is
my
belief
that
men
prosper
better
alone
have
no
illusions
trust
nobody
feel
that
every
man
hand
is
against
you
and
then
you
will
know
where
you
stand
that
is
my
policy
your
cousin
here
his
one
mistake
is
that
he
trusts
every
one
he
likes
everybody
he
even
trusts
me
a
little
on
very
small
evidence
i
can
assure
you
he
would
hate
me
if
he
could
but
because
we
are
of
the
same
blood
he
can
not
even
bring
himself
to
do
that
eh
jasper
am
i
not
right
if
you
think
you
have
said
enough
to
these
children
said
cousin
jasper
wincing
but
still
quiet
perhaps
we
had
better
discuss
this
business
further
in
some
other
room
very
well
returned
the
other
quite
again
i
should
be
glad
enough
to
have
them
hear
the
whole
but
of
course
if
there
are
some
things
that
you
do
not
wish
known
he
walked
away
toward
the
study
quite
at
his
ease
humming
a
tune
and
casting
sharp
appraising
glances
about
him
as
though
the
thought
of
ownership
were
already
in
his
mind
the
door
beyond
the
hall
closed
behind
them
what
a
hateful
man
cried
janet
almost
in
tears
poor
cousin
jasper
and
we
ca
do
anything
to
help
him
oliver
equally
miserable
stood
at
the
window
the
moon
was
coming
up
behind
the
trees
a
great
red
moon
just
past
the
full
misshapen
and
lopsided
that
seemed
to
be
laughing
at
them
he
stamped
his
foot
in
angry
impotence
and
he
does
seem
to
me
even
to
believe
in
himself
it
is
as
though
he
were
playing
a
part
just
showing
off
he
pointed
through
the
window
at
the
disgraceful
cart
and
dejected
old
horse
standing
before
the
wide
white
steps
i
do
think
he
has
to
drive
that
wretched
wagon
at
all
he
just
does
it
to
make
cousin
jasper
ridiculous
the
session
in
the
study
was
prolonged
so
late
that
in
the
end
janet
and
oliver
abandoned
their
sleepy
effort
to
wait
until
anthony
crawford
should
depart
and
went
dispiritedly
upstairs
to
bed
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
one
thing
said
oliver
firmly
as
they
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs
i
am
going
to
ask
the
beeman
what
we
ought
to
do
i
feel
as
though
i
had
known
him
always
and
i
am
sure
he
can
help
us
but
ought
we
to
tell
him
cousin
jasper
secrets
objected
janet
doubtfully
and
by
the
way
what
is
his
name
you
never
told
me
why
i
do
know
it
exclaimed
oliver
in
a
tone
of
complete
astonishment
i
never
even
noticed
that
i
did
it
does
matter
i
will
ask
him
and
you
understand
from
the
first
minute
he
speaks
that
you
can
trust
the
beeman
he
went
away
to
his
room
where
so
it
seemed
to
him
he
had
been
asleep
a
long
time
before
the
rattle
of
wheels
aroused
him
he
peered
drowsily
through
the
window
and
saw
the
old
white
horse
with
its
lean
erect
driver
move
slowly
down
toward
the
gate
and
unreal
in
the
moonlight
fantastic
omens
of
some
unknown
mischief
that
was
brewing
next
morning
as
he
and
janet
left
the
car
beside
the
orchard
wall
and
climbed
the
grassy
slope
of
the
hill
oliver
one
misgiving
was
lest
the
beeman
should
not
be
there
but
yes
as
they
came
up
the
steep
path
they
heard
voices
and
smelled
the
sharp
pleasant
odor
of
wood
smoke
drifting
down
toward
them
the
wind
was
high
singing
and
swooping
about
the
hilltop
slamming
the
swinging
door
of
the
house
and
scattering
in
all
directions
such
bold
bees
as
had
ventured
out
to
ride
down
the
boisterous
breeze
to
the
meadows
below
janet
was
as
warmly
welcomed
as
oliver
and
they
were
both
bidden
to
come
in
and
sit
down
beside
the
table
where
polly
was
sorting
the
little
wooden
boxes
in
which
the
bees
build
the
honeycomb
we
were
just
going
to
begin
a
story
said
the
beeman
polly
has
been
clamoring
for
it
for
half
an
hour
but
i
wanted
to
ask
you
something
broke
in
oliver
too
much
excited
for
good
manners
could
you
wait
i
believe
said
the
beeman
slowly
giving
him
an
odd
glance
that
seemed
to
carry
a
message
of
complete
understanding
i
believe
that
sometimes
it
is
better
when
you
are
troubled
about
something
to
cool
off
and
settle
down
and
come
at
an
affair
slowly
and
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
times
oliver
nodded
he
felt
quite
sure
that
the
beeman
was
right
chapter
v
the
ghost
ship
cicely
hallowell
sighed
deeply
as
she
pushed
away
the
heap
of
papers
before
her
and
brushed
back
the
hair
from
her
aching
forehead
she
was
weary
of
her
task
and
the
room
was
growing
dark
and
cold
she
was
beginning
moreover
to
be
uneasily
conscious
that
the
two
men
at
the
far
end
of
the
long
table
had
forgotten
her
presence
behind
the
pile
of
great
ledgers
and
were
talking
of
things
that
she
was
not
meant
to
hear
half
an
hour
earlier
her
brother
alan
had
rushed
in
to
see
whether
she
were
not
ready
for
their
afternoon
ride
and
had
been
disappointedly
impatient
when
she
shook
her
head
it
is
a
glorious
day
so
cold
and
the
roads
so
deep
in
snow
the
horses
are
like
wild
things
and
will
give
us
a
famous
gallop
up
the
valley
oh
do
come
cicely
but
no
she
must
stay
in
the
big
gloomy
countinghouse
to
finish
the
letters
that
she
had
promised
to
copy
for
her
father
while
alan
had
flung
off
saying
over
his
shoulder
as
he
departed
to
take
his
ride
alone
it
is
very
wrong
to
miss
fun
and
adventure
by
toiling
and
moiling
here
think
how
the
sea
will
look
and
how
the
blasts
will
be
blowing
over
our
windy
hill
the
place
seemed
very
cheerless
and
empty
after
he
had
gone
the
long
windows
gave
little
light
on
that
gray
winter
afternoon
and
the
big
fireplace
with
its
glowing
logs
was
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
there
were
shadows
already
on
the
shelves
of
heavy
ledgers
lining
the
walls
and
on
the
rows
of
ship
models
all
up
and
down
the
sides
of
the
big
countingroom
those
lines
of
dusty
volumes
held
records
that
alan
was
forever
reading
tales
of
wonderful
voyages
of
spices
and
gold
dust
and
jewels
brought
home
from
the
orient
of
famines
in
far
lands
broken
by
the
coming
of
american
grain
ships
of
profits
reckoned
in
ducats
and
doubloons
and
spanish
pieces
of
eight
cicely
was
fond
of
drawing
and
loved
far
more
than
copying
dull
letters
to
make
sketches
of
those
miniature
vessels
in
the
glass
cases
that
stood
for
the
hallowell
ships
that
had
scoured
the
oceans
of
the
world
they
had
been
wrecked
on
coral
reefs
in
hot
distant
seas
they
had
lain
becalmed
with
priceless
cargoes
in
waters
their
crews
were
as
skillful
with
the
long
guns
as
they
were
at
handling
the
sails
their
captains
were
as
at
home
in
shanghai
or
calcutta
as
they
were
in
the
streets
of
the
little
seaport
town
where
they
had
been
born
cicely
could
remember
when
the
big
countingroom
had
been
crowded
with
clerks
and
had
hummed
like
a
beehive
with
the
myriad
activities
of
the
hallowell
trade
it
was
a
dull
and
empty
place
now
and
the
fleet
of
hallowell
ships
was
scattered
some
lying
at
anchor
some
dismantled
and
sold
some
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
for
this
was
the
third
year
of
that
struggle
with
england
that
the
histories
were
to
call
the
war
of
cicely
for
all
her
thirteen
years
looked
very
small
sitting
there
at
the
end
of
the
long
table
in
her
sprigged
gown
her
feet
in
their
strapped
slippers
perched
on
the
rung
of
the
high
office
stool
she
had
just
taken
up
her
pen
to
begin
writing
again
when
the
voices
of
the
two
men
by
the
fire
rose
so
suddenly
that
she
dropped
it
startled
her
father
tone
fell
almost
immediately
to
strained
quiet
but
martin
hallowell
his
partner
went
on
with
angry
insistence
she
knew
him
to
be
and
impetuous
but
she
had
never
heard
such
words
from
him
before
with
a
quick
eager
motion
that
was
the
embodiment
of
impatient
greed
martin
was
running
his
finger
down
the
columns
of
the
ledger
before
him
there
is
no
ship
like
a
privateer
and
no
privateer
like
the
he
was
saying
send
her
on
one
more
voyage
and
we
shall
be
rich
men
there
was
an
ugly
tremor
in
his
voice
that
quavered
and
broke
in
spite
of
his
attempts
to
keep
it
calm
i
do
not
care
to
be
one
of
those
who
gathers
riches
from
a
war
returned
reuben
hallowell
cicely
father
there
was
something
in
the
dry
calm
of
his
answer
that
seemed
to
stir
martin
to
uncontrollable
anger
it
is
like
you
reuben
hallowell
he
said
to
be
willing
to
ruin
my
plans
by
your
foolish
scruples
just
when
a
real
prize
is
within
reach
but
i
vow
you
shall
not
do
it
you
shall
be
a
wealthy
man
in
spite
of
yourself
and
let
me
remind
you
that
two
years
ago
before
we
built
the
you
were
a
precious
poor
one
the
hallowell
partners
were
not
brothers
but
cousins
with
father
much
the
older
of
the
two
they
had
inherited
the
business
from
their
fathers
for
such
an
pair
would
never
have
been
joined
together
from
choice
many
of
their
discussions
ended
in
stormy
words
but
never
before
had
martin
dark
face
showed
such
quivering
rage
as
when
he
arose
now
gathered
up
his
papers
and
went
away
to
his
own
room
closing
the
door
smartly
behind
him
cicely
got
up
also
and
went
down
the
long
countingroom
to
where
her
father
sat
by
the
fire
i
heard
what
you
and
cousin
martin
were
saying
she
told
him
hesitatingly
i
am
afraid
you
did
not
remember
that
i
was
there
but
it
does
not
matter
for
i
did
not
understand
what
cousin
martin
was
so
angry
about
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
not
understand
her
father
replied
rather
slowly
and
wearily
she
thought
although
sometimes
i
am
not
certain
that
i
understand
these
troubled
times
myself
across
the
seas
the
emperor
napoleon
a
man
of
infinite
genius
for
setting
the
world
by
the
ears
has
been
warring
with
england
for
the
last
ten
years
and
more
he
and
the
british
with
their
blockades
and
embargoes
and
orders
in
council
have
long
been
striving
to
ruin
each
other
yet
have
achieved
their
greatest
success
in
ruining
a
peaceable
old
gentleman
in
america
who
relies
on
his
ships
to
bring
him
a
livelihood
to
oppress
neutral
shipping
leads
in
the
end
to
war
although
i
vow
that
often
congress
must
have
felt
that
it
should
toss
up
a
penny
to
determine
whether
the
declaration
should
be
against
france
or
england
some
stubborn
british
minister
however
decided
to
countenance
the
stealing
of
sailors
from
our
ships
to
fill
up
the
scanty
crews
of
their
own
navy
and
a
stubborn
british
nation
felt
that
it
must
back
him
so
in
the
end
the
war
was
with
england
and
have
we
not
won
many
glorious
victories
asked
cicely
ay
there
have
been
victories
out
of
her
fleet
of
seven
hundred
and
thirty
sail
england
has
lost
a
handful
to
us
and
we
have
shown
how
small
our
navy
is
and
how
great
is
its
spirit
there
have
been
passages
of
arms
on
land
also
of
which
we
do
not
love
to
talk
and
we
have
sent
out
our
privateer
vessels
armed
ships
that
prey
upon
england
commerce
yet
do
not
belong
to
our
navy
they
have
done
great
things
have
cut
deep
into
england
overseas
trade
and
have
brought
home
many
a
valuable
prize
to
fill
the
pockets
of
their
owners
such
a
vessel
is
our
built
at
your
cousin
instigation
and
launched
at
the
moment
when
our
fortunes
were
at
their
lowest
ebb
since
we
had
not
sufficient
funds
to
equip
her
nearly
every
one
in
this
town
put
money
into
her
from
john
harwood
the
minister
down
to
jack
marvin
who
digs
our
garden
it
was
a
patriotic
venture
and
a
risky
one
but
she
has
brought
home
great
profits
in
prize
money
and
our
own
share
has
reëstablished
the
firm
of
hallowell
your
cousin
martin
says
that
one
more
voyage
will
bring
us
not
only
profit
but
real
wealth
but
i
say
he
struck
his
hand
suddenly
upon
the
table
i
say
that
there
shall
not
be
another
why
the
question
was
startled
from
cicely
by
his
sudden
vehemence
yet
it
was
not
from
him
that
she
was
to
receive
the
answer
the
door
opened
to
admit
martin
hallowell
who
had
come
back
apparently
for
a
last
word
you
say
he
began
at
once
that
the
needs
refitting
and
can
not
be
made
seaworthy
in
less
than
a
month
his
partner
nodded
i
say
that
she
shall
sail
in
a
week
declared
martin
and
i
say
no
cried
reuben
hallowell
you
say
too
that
the
war
is
nearly
over
that
the
peace
commission
is
sitting
at
ghent
and
that
rumors
are
coming
home
that
they
are
near
to
an
agreement
that
is
your
excuse
for
wishing
to
keep
our
privateers
at
home
you
are
a
foolish
and
an
overscrupulous
man
reuben
hallowell
for
i
say
that
such
a
reason
makes
all
the
more
haste
for
her
to
be
gone
we
should
reap
what
profit
we
can
while
there
is
yet
time
he
leaned
forward
his
dark
eager
face
close
to
theirs
all
caution
forgotten
in
the
intensity
of
his
purpose
once
at
sea
the
is
beyond
reach
of
tidings
or
orders
if
she
should
take
her
last
and
richest
prizes
a
little
after
peace
has
been
declared
who
will
ever
know
it
he
was
silent
and
stood
staring
at
them
with
unwavering
defiant
eyes
cicely
could
hear
her
sharply
drawn
breath
as
she
waited
for
her
father
to
answer
we
are
partners
no
longer
martin
hallowell
he
said
we
were
not
born
to
work
together
and
it
is
clear
that
we
have
come
to
the
parting
of
the
ways
we
will
make
division
of
our
holdings
for
i
tell
you
plainly
that
i
will
have
no
more
to
do
with
you
and
your
dishonest
schemes
it
shall
be
as
you
say
martin
agreed
quick
to
press
home
an
advantage
and
since
it
was
i
who
urged
the
building
and
launching
of
the
it
is
only
proper
that
she
should
fall
to
my
share
she
shall
sail
this
day
week
as
i
have
told
you
and
you
my
dear
cousin
for
your
effort
to
stop
her
shall
soon
be
a
most
regretful
man
he
went
out
this
time
closing
the
door
very
gently
behind
him
the
echoes
of
his
vague
threat
seemed
to
hang
in
the
great
room
long
after
he
was
gone
what
what
can
he
do
questioned
cicely
her
father
with
a
visible
effort
answered
cheerfully
an
angry
man
loves
to
threaten
but
we
have
naught
to
fear
from
him
and
now
he
gathered
the
big
ledger
under
his
arm
i
must
work
for
a
little
in
the
countingroom
and
then
we
will
go
home
cicely
left
alone
went
back
to
fetch
her
letters
and
stopped
for
a
moment
at
one
of
the
long
windows
to
look
down
upon
the
harbor
where
the
dipped
and
swayed
at
anchor
a
stately
beautiful
thing
that
seemed
to
quiver
with
life
as
she
rocked
in
the
choppy
seas
her
shimmering
reflection
beginning
to
be
colored
by
the
sunset
rocking
and
dancing
with
her
oh
i
must
draw
it
cried
cicely
catching
up
a
sheet
of
fresh
paper
if
only
the
light
holds
and
the
ship
does
not
swing
round
with
the
tide
the
minutes
passed
while
she
worked
eagerly
but
finally
was
forced
to
lay
down
her
pencil
unable
to
see
more
in
the
dusk
the
door
flew
open
and
some
one
came
in
with
the
impulsive
rush
that
belonged
only
to
her
brother
alan
what
cicely
still
here
and
trying
to
draw
in
the
dark
let
me
see
what
you
have
done
he
exclaimed
he
lit
a
candle
and
examined
the
paper
i
vow
that
is
good
oh
cicely
that
is
a
wonderful
ship
for
some
reason
there
was
a
cold
clutch
at
cicely
heart
yes
she
answered
faintly
i
have
just
had
such
a
talk
with
cousin
martin
the
boy
went
on
excitedly
i
did
not
quite
understand
the
way
of
it
but
he
said
that
he
and
my
father
were
to
divide
and
that
the
was
to
be
his
own
entire
he
wants
me
to
go
with
her
on
her
next
voyage
he
says
the
war
is
not
nearly
done
and
that
there
will
be
many
months
of
fighting
and
still
he
thinks
a
great
fellow
of
sixteen
like
me
should
have
been
a
ship
officer
long
ago
and
i
think
so
too
what
a
good
fellow
cousin
martin
is
alan
admired
his
elder
cousin
greatly
cicely
well
knew
and
he
had
indeed
a
touch
of
the
same
excitable
headstrong
nature
she
could
well
understand
how
martin
hallowell
had
dazzled
the
boy
with
tales
of
what
he
would
see
and
do
had
there
been
such
a
plan
in
her
mind
when
he
first
uttered
his
threat
against
her
father
or
had
it
only
flashed
upon
him
as
he
met
alan
running
up
the
stairs
eager
vigorous
and
ready
for
any
adventure
it
is
all
arranged
declared
alan
except
just
to
tell
my
father
no
no
she
cried
wildly
but
he
did
not
even
listen
i
will
go
in
and
speak
to
him
now
he
said
she
could
not
even
cry
out
as
the
door
closed
behind
him
alan
had
his
father
stern
and
steady
pride
but
there
were
differences
of
temperament
that
led
to
frequent
clashes
of
will
between
them
reuben
hallowell
loved
both
his
motherless
children
but
he
understood
his
son
less
well
than
his
daughter
what
would
be
the
result
of
that
interview
cicely
wondered
sitting
quaking
beside
the
candle
that
burned
so
lonely
in
the
gloom
would
her
father
know
how
to
be
firm
and
patient
how
to
undo
the
harm
that
martin
hallowell
had
wrought
it
seemed
as
she
sat
there
shivering
that
she
could
not
endure
the
suspense
she
had
not
long
to
wait
the
door
banged
open
and
alan
stood
for
a
moment
on
the
threshold
my
father
forbids
my
sailing
on
the
i
have
told
him
i
should
go
in
spite
of
him
he
said
he
walked
away
along
the
corridor
and
down
the
stone
steps
his
feet
quicker
and
lighter
than
martin
hallowell
but
his
footsteps
sounding
in
some
vague
terrible
way
like
his
cousin
as
he
strode
out
and
down
the
stairs
her
father
came
in
a
moment
later
you
should
have
been
at
home
long
since
this
my
child
was
all
he
said
and
they
went
out
together
without
further
talk
of
the
matter
into
the
sharp
air
of
the
snowy
night
at
the
corner
of
the
steep
narrow
street
cicely
caught
sight
of
martin
hallowell
talking
to
a
man
whom
she
recognized
as
an
old
seaman
who
had
sailed
for
years
upon
the
hallowell
ships
something
martin
had
said
must
have
angered
the
sailor
for
he
was
talking
loudly
regardless
of
who
might
hear
no
the
old
man
was
saying
there
not
every
one
in
the
world
will
do
your
bidding
though
you
may
think
so
you
can
defy
the
old
one
and
talk
over
the
young
one
to
go
your
way
but
there
one
man
will
not
sail
on
any
ship
of
yours
and
that
ben
barton
i
starve
ashore
first
cicely
quick
ear
caught
his
words
as
she
and
her
father
passed
by
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
it
did
not
seem
that
reuben
hallowell
had
heard
one
day
passed
two
three
four
days
and
cicely
one
thought
was
that
the
was
to
sail
in
seven
workmen
were
swarming
all
over
her
like
bees
hammering
calking
and
painting
yet
it
was
plain
that
they
could
not
do
in
a
week
what
needed
a
month
to
finish
alan
was
at
the
wharf
all
day
holding
frequent
conferences
with
his
cousin
reuben
hallowell
went
to
and
fro
among
the
townspeople
urging
them
to
say
that
the
ship
in
which
they
were
part
owners
must
abide
at
home
but
either
because
they
were
less
sure
of
peace
than
he
or
because
their
eyes
were
blinded
by
past
good
fortune
and
hopes
of
future
gain
they
would
not
listen
between
father
and
son
no
words
were
passed
since
each
was
waiting
for
the
other
stubborn
pride
to
give
way
on
the
fifth
day
cicely
had
gone
out
to
ride
on
a
clear
snowy
afternoon
with
the
white
world
shining
before
her
and
with
the
highway
under
the
horses
feet
she
missed
alan
sorely
for
this
was
their
favorite
road
up
the
valley
to
the
west
of
the
town
as
far
as
the
round
bare
hill
with
the
single
oak
tree
that
they
liked
to
call
theirs
the
servant
with
her
had
dropped
behind
and
she
was
just
turning
her
horse
into
the
bypath
leading
to
the
hill
when
she
saw
a
sturdy
figure
coming
down
the
slope
the
brown
face
tattooed
hands
and
the
small
bundle
of
possessions
done
up
in
a
blue
handkerchief
could
only
be
a
sailor
a
sailor
who
proved
to
be
ben
barton
i
going
to
the
next
seaport
to
find
another
berth
since
refused
to
sail
on
the
he
explained
in
answer
to
her
questions
martin
has
had
to
get
a
new
skipper
and
a
new
crew
for
none
of
the
old
hands
would
sail
when
they
heard
it
was
against
your
father
wishes
there
was
a
bark
came
in
from
delaware
to
be
laid
up
for
repairs
with
mostly
swedes
aboard
and
they
have
manned
the
from
her
the
ship
is
to
sail
on
friday
at
midnight
with
the
turning
tide
but
she
goes
without
ben
barton
he
dropped
his
voice
and
came
nearer
i
will
tell
you
this
though
i
should
not
he
said
there
some
one
to
join
at
the
last
minute
who
will
get
into
a
boat
waiting
at
the
wharf
in
the
dark
some
one
you
love
miss
who
ought
to
be
stopping
ashore
with
the
rest
of
us
you
should
find
some
way
to
keep
him
back
oh
if
i
only
could
she
cried
there
only
you
can
do
it
he
answered
hallowell
blood
can
only
be
ruled
by
hallowell
blood
as
we
say
on
hallowell
ships
well
be
going
on
again
i
had
climbed
the
path
there
to
take
one
more
look
at
the
harbor
where
you
can
see
it
between
the
hills
maybe
your
father
will
find
a
place
for
me
when
his
vessels
go
to
sea
for
trade
again
and
i
never
forget
him
nor
you
miss
cicely
do
you
remember
how
you
and
your
brother
once
hid
under
the
wharf
and
called
out
from
that
echoing
place
as
though
you
were
lost
souls
out
of
the
sea
there
was
one
honest
old
sailorman
that
nearly
lost
his
wits
for
terror
since
we
seafaring
folk
have
no
love
for
ghosts
mark
my
words
there
will
no
good
come
to
the
from
setting
sail
of
a
friday
for
that
alone
i
would
stay
ashore
though
there
other
things
to
hold
me
too
he
strode
away
down
the
snowy
road
leaving
cicely
smiling
at
first
at
the
recollection
of
that
game
that
had
so
frightened
him
when
she
and
her
brother
had
played
at
ghosts
then
grave
in
a
moment
when
she
thought
how
soon
that
brother
was
to
be
gone
on
friday
the
day
after
he
would
sail
unless
she
could
stop
him
but
how
could
she
the
next
day
she
made
the
desperate
effort
of
appealing
to
her
father
but
quite
in
vain
reuben
hallowell
would
not
believe
either
that
the
would
sail
or
that
his
son
would
go
with
her
and
if
alan
wishes
to
cut
himself
off
from
his
own
people
forever
let
him
he
said
finally
unable
to
endure
the
thought
that
any
one
should
dare
to
defy
his
will
friday
came
the
shadows
of
friday
night
stole
through
the
big
house
yet
nothing
had
been
done
cicely
sat
by
the
fire
in
her
bedroom
leaning
back
against
the
flowered
cushion
of
the
big
armchair
gazing
into
the
flames
in
the
next
room
she
could
hear
vague
sounds
of
preparations
feet
going
to
and
fro
a
door
opening
and
closing
a
pair
of
heavy
boots
dropped
upon
the
floor
the
night
was
dark
outside
with
a
blustering
wind
and
occasional
flurries
of
snow
that
struck
sharply
against
the
window
it
was
ten
the
sounds
had
ceased
as
though
alan
had
finished
making
ready
and
was
waiting
perhaps
sitting
silent
in
the
dark
perhaps
lying
down
for
an
hour
or
two
of
sleep
before
the
fateful
hour
of
the
high
tide
cicely
heard
her
father
below
barring
the
door
putting
out
the
candles
making
ready
for
a
night
that
would
surely
bring
him
no
sleep
presently
he
passed
her
door
glanced
inside
and
came
in
to
stand
for
a
minute
beside
her
fire
how
worn
he
had
grown
to
look
just
within
the
space
of
this
last
week
he
said
scarcely
a
word
it
was
as
though
his
unhappiness
merely
craved
company
and
shrank
from
the
knowledge
of
what
the
night
might
bring
at
last
he
said
you
should
be
in
bed
good
night
my
dear
as
he
went
out
he
turned
to
look
back
at
her
with
a
glance
of
haggard
helpless
misery
it
was
as
though
he
said
my
pride
has
bound
and
stifled
me
i
can
not
speak
a
word
to
stop
him
but
wo
you
ca
you
persuade
him
somehow
not
to
go
very
carefully
and
without
a
sound
cicely
rose
and
went
to
her
closet
to
take
down
her
warm
fur
cloak
she
had
realized
in
the
moment
of
seeing
her
father
pleading
look
that
she
had
a
plan
one
that
had
been
in
her
mind
ever
since
the
day
that
she
had
talked
with
ben
barton
what
she
had
really
lacked
was
courage
to
put
it
into
execution
yet
now
as
she
drew
the
cloak
about
her
and
pulled
down
her
hood
her
hands
did
not
even
tremble
nor
did
her
determination
falter
the
house
was
absolutely
still
as
she
stole
noiselessly
down
the
stairs
and
slipped
out
of
the
door
for
a
girl
who
had
almost
never
been
allowed
upon
the
street
alone
the
wintry
night
should
have
been
full
of
terrors
but
to
cicely
they
meant
nothing
as
she
ran
down
the
steep
high
street
with
the
gale
blustering
behind
her
she
saw
things
that
she
had
never
believed
existed
a
burly
waterman
quarreling
with
his
wife
behind
a
dirty
lighted
window
the
open
door
of
a
tavern
showing
a
room
with
a
crowd
of
shouting
sailors
drinking
within
a
furtive
black
shadow
that
skulked
into
an
alleyway
and
remained
there
silent
and
hidden
as
she
passed
she
reached
the
wharves
at
last
where
the
wind
was
stronger
and
where
the
waves
slapped
and
dashed
against
the
barnacled
piles
throwing
their
spray
against
the
windows
of
the
locked
warehouses
even
now
she
did
not
hesitate
she
ran
a
gray
flitting
form
across
the
open
space
at
the
head
of
the
wharf
and
disappeared
there
was
a
wait
of
a
few
minutes
then
came
the
dip
of
oars
through
the
dark
and
the
sound
of
men
voices
talking
above
the
high
wind
martin
hallowell
was
coming
ashore
in
the
boat
that
was
to
carry
alan
away
beyond
them
the
lights
of
the
showed
where
she
was
getting
up
sail
martin
made
the
landing
with
some
difficulty
climbed
the
ladder
to
the
wharf
and
stood
bracing
himself
against
the
heavy
wind
we
are
a
little
early
he
said
hold
fast
there
with
the
boat
hook
he
will
be
here
in
a
his
voice
was
drowned
by
a
strange
sound
an
unearthly
wailing
that
seemed
to
rise
from
the
water
beneath
but
which
filled
the
air
until
there
was
no
saying
from
what
direction
it
came
it
lifted
and
dropped
hung
sobbing
and
echoing
above
the
water
then
died
away
holy
anthony
help
us
cried
the
nearest
sailor
it
is
the
soul
of
some
poor
drowned
creature
caught
among
the
weeds
give
way
roared
the
man
at
the
rudder
and
with
one
accord
the
oars
dropped
into
the
water
stop
wait
it
it
is
nothing
you
fools
cried
martin
hallowell
but
his
own
voice
quavered
with
terror
and
carried
little
reassurance
to
the
frightened
men
the
boat
hung
doubtfully
a
ship
length
from
the
pier
the
oars
dipping
to
hold
it
into
the
wind
the
men
hesitating
ashamed
of
their
terror
yet
fearing
to
come
closer
again
the
cry
broke
forth
resounding
again
and
again
mingling
in
terrible
ghostly
fashion
with
the
splashing
and
gurgling
of
the
water
the
boat
shot
away
into
the
dark
just
as
alan
came
running
down
the
wharf
shouting
to
them
to
come
back
the
sailors
however
bent
to
their
oars
unheeding
the
lantern
in
the
stern
dipped
and
jerked
as
they
rowed
away
and
the
light
finally
went
out
of
sight
as
the
boat
drew
alongside
the
it
was
just
possible
to
make
out
the
big
ship
as
she
weighed
anchor
and
rolling
and
plunging
moved
slowly
out
into
the
tideway
she
gone
without
me
cried
alan
oh
they
might
have
come
back
the
cowards
did
you
hear
that
that
terrible
sound
asked
martin
hallowell
in
a
second
pause
between
the
breaking
of
two
waves
it
was
possible
to
hear
his
teeth
chatter
terrible
cried
alan
in
disgust
that
was
only
my
sister
cicely
hiding
under
the
wharf
it
was
a
game
we
once
played
to
frighten
ben
barton
come
out
he
ordered
sternly
kneeling
down
and
thrusting
an
arm
into
the
dark
space
to
help
her
out
cicely
came
wet
and
shivering
with
her
hair
streaked
with
mud
and
her
hands
scratched
and
cut
by
the
sharp
barnacles
her
face
showed
white
in
the
dark
as
she
looked
up
appealingly
at
her
brother
but
he
turned
from
her
without
a
sign
before
she
could
follow
him
martin
hallowell
had
seized
her
by
the
arm
you
he
cried
you
he
shook
her
until
she
was
dizzy
until
the
dark
windy
world
spun
before
her
eyes
he
cried
out
at
her
with
a
terrible
voice
and
with
words
that
she
only
half
understood
all
the
rage
stored
up
within
him
during
his
bitter
struggle
to
get
his
ship
under
way
all
the
baffled
hopes
of
his
revenge
all
the
shame
for
his
recent
terror
broke
forth
into
blind
fury
against
the
girl
who
had
stood
in
his
way
i
will
teach
you
he
shouted
grasping
her
arm
tighter
until
she
winced
with
pain
i
will
show
you
that
you
ca
his
words
were
cut
short
by
a
stinging
blow
across
the
mouth
from
which
he
staggered
back
dropping
cicely
arm
and
staring
in
gaping
astonishment
at
his
assailant
that
is
my
sister
said
alan
very
stiff
and
quiet
and
suddenly
very
like
his
father
whatever
she
has
done
you
are
not
to
touch
her
she
has
ruined
my
chance
of
sailing
with
the
but
at
least
she
has
shown
me
what
what
you
are
martin
hallowell
with
his
arm
about
cicely
alan
went
down
the
pier
while
martin
confounded
and
silenced
stood
staring
after
them
the
two
said
nothing
as
they
climbed
the
high
street
although
much
must
have
been
passing
in
the
boy
mind
as
he
pushed
open
their
own
door
and
came
into
the
dusky
hallway
he
spoke
for
the
first
time
can
you
wait
here
by
the
fire
a
minute
cicely
i
am
going
up
first
to
to
tell
my
father
what
a
fool
i
have
been
the
weeks
of
winter
passed
news
came
that
peace
had
been
signed
on
christmas
eve
one
after
another
the
ships
of
war
came
straggling
home
some
had
taken
prizes
all
had
been
harried
by
the
winter
storms
and
none
brought
news
of
the
one
carolina
vessel
that
put
in
for
repairs
told
of
picking
up
a
crew
adrift
in
boats
and
of
setting
them
aboard
a
ship
bound
for
chesapeake
bay
and
the
coast
of
delaware
they
were
most
of
them
swedes
the
sailors
told
alan
and
they
were
not
very
willing
to
talk
of
the
ship
they
had
lost
but
it
might
have
been
the
reuben
hallowell
was
straining
all
his
resources
to
send
his
idle
ships
to
sea
and
to
reëstablish
the
trade
of
peace
yet
when
he
urged
his
fellow
townsmen
to
strive
to
gain
the
commerce
america
had
lost
lest
it
be
gone
forever
they
still
hung
back
we
must
know
first
where
we
stand
they
said
there
is
hope
still
that
we
have
not
lost
the
and
that
she
will
come
to
port
with
fortune
for
us
all
a
stormy
february
passed
and
there
came
at
last
a
gusty
day
of
march
it
was
a
sunday
with
the
air
clean
after
a
shower
and
with
all
the
townspeople
moving
down
the
high
street
from
their
churches
at
the
hour
of
noon
there
had
been
a
tempest
of
wind
and
rain
but
it
had
cleared
leaving
the
waters
still
gray
but
with
the
sky
turning
to
blue
cicely
was
among
the
first
walking
with
her
father
and
brother
and
had
stopped
as
they
came
to
their
own
door
to
glance
down
at
the
harbor
laid
out
in
a
circle
of
moving
blue
water
below
them
oh
look
look
she
cried
suddenly
a
ship
was
sailing
slowly
up
the
bay
a
stately
ship
that
dipped
a
little
and
rose
again
as
she
came
but
held
her
course
steady
for
the
wharves
her
sails
shone
white
in
the
fitful
sun
the
lines
of
her
hull
showed
dark
against
the
gray
water
the
tracery
of
her
rigging
and
even
the
colors
of
her
flag
were
distinct
against
the
sky
and
yet
she
did
not
seem
like
any
ship
they
had
ever
seen
before
cicely
having
drawn
that
vessel
line
for
line
masts
hull
ropes
and
spars
knew
that
this
was
the
yet
what
was
so
strange
about
her
why
was
she
so
steady
in
those
changing
gusts
of
wind
what
was
there
that
made
her
sails
so
shining
and
transparent
like
the
texture
of
a
cloud
the
girl
was
aware
that
among
the
crowd
that
had
gathered
to
watch
the
strange
vision
martin
hallowell
was
pushing
to
the
front
gazing
with
all
his
eyes
ben
barton
too
who
had
come
back
the
week
before
to
ask
for
a
place
on
reuben
hallowell
ships
was
pressing
close
to
alan
elbow
the
wind
dead
off
shore
and
here
she
comes
straight
in
she
heard
the
old
sailor
mutter
not
even
the
could
sail
like
that
and
yet
it
is
the
right
enough
the
vessel
came
nearer
and
nearer
then
of
a
sudden
stopped
quivered
as
though
struck
by
a
violent
adverse
wind
her
main
topsail
blew
out
suddenly
and
went
streaming
forth
in
the
gale
a
jib
split
to
ribbons
before
their
eyes
and
spar
after
spar
was
carried
away
she
careened
as
though
before
a
hurricane
her
foremast
came
down
with
a
soundless
smother
of
sail
and
wreckage
further
and
further
she
tilted
and
then
suddenly
she
had
vanished
and
there
was
nothing
left
but
the
march
sunshine
and
the
tossing
empty
bay
the
crowd
stood
breathless
waiting
for
some
one
to
speak
it
was
only
ben
barton
who
was
able
to
find
his
voice
i
heard
of
such
things
before
he
said
the
wise
skippers
all
say
it
is
a
mirage
but
the
wiser
sailormen
say
it
is
a
message
from
another
world
she
gone
our
is
and
there
no
wind
under
heaven
will
ever
blow
her
home
again
martin
hallowell
had
swung
on
his
heel
and
was
walking
away
down
the
street
facing
the
fact
finally
that
his
venture
was
at
an
end
a
tall
man
with
dangling
watch
seals
edged
up
to
cicely
father
i
am
satisfied
at
last
reuben
hallowell
that
our
ship
is
lost
he
said
we
did
wrong
to
wait
for
war
to
make
our
fortunes
and
it
is
high
time
that
we
went
back
to
the
lesser
risks
and
the
smaller
gains
of
peace
will
you
let
me
join
in
lading
your
next
vessel
you
are
the
only
man
among
us
who
has
known
when
a
war
ends
and
peace
begins
i
thinking
there
will
be
some
tall
ships
sailing
out
of
this
port
soon
said
ben
barton
speaking
low
to
cicily
and
alan
it
will
be
on
a
better
craft
than
the
even
that
your
brother
will
be
officer
before
long
what
seas
we
cruise
he
and
i
and
what
treasures
we
bring
back
to
you
miss
cicely
i
go
with
the
son
of
reuben
hallowell
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
if
only
he
never
asks
me
to
put
to
sea
of
a
friday
chapter
vi
janet
adventure
throughout
the
telling
of
the
story
polly
and
janet
had
been
very
busy
sorting
and
putting
together
the
little
honey
boxes
that
were
to
be
set
in
larger
frames
and
hung
in
the
upper
story
of
the
beehives
there
was
now
such
a
great
heap
of
them
ready
that
the
beeman
gathered
them
into
a
basket
and
summoning
oliver
to
help
him
carried
them
outside
he
did
not
immediately
go
down
the
slope
to
the
beehives
but
set
the
basket
on
the
step
and
sat
down
on
the
bench
beside
it
you
had
something
to
tell
me
he
said
something
that
disturbed
and
excited
you
i
thought
it
might
be
better
for
you
to
wait
a
little
i
should
like
to
hear
it
now
yes
it
is
clearer
in
my
head
now
oliver
agreed
it
is
about
my
cousin
jasper
that
we
are
visiting
i
want
to
help
him
though
he
smiled
at
the
recollection
yet
made
frank
confession
that
first
day
i
was
here
i
was
so
angry
i
almost
hated
him
if
i
thought
that
were
true
responded
his
friend
gravely
i
should
have
to
ask
you
never
to
come
here
again
not
only
because
i
am
fond
of
your
cousin
myself
but
because
i
value
my
bees
there
is
an
old
superstition
that
you
must
not
hate
where
bees
are
for
they
feel
it
and
pine
away
and
die
i
can
not
have
my
bees
destroyed
the
boy
looking
up
quickly
at
his
broad
friendly
smile
realized
that
the
man
believed
neither
the
old
superstition
nor
that
oliver
entertained
any
evil
feelings
perhaps
went
on
the
beeman
the
bees
were
in
some
danger
that
first
day
you
had
it
in
mind
then
to
go
away
for
good
i
think
oliver
nodded
he
wondered
how
he
could
ever
have
made
that
selfish
resolution
to
run
away
how
did
you
know
he
asked
i
had
guessed
it
from
oh
various
things
i
am
about
the
age
of
your
cousin
jasper
but
i
know
more
than
he
about
people
of
your
years
from
being
polly
father
i
even
had
some
idea
of
what
was
the
immediate
cause
of
your
going
the
boy
flushed
so
guiltily
that
he
went
on
in
kindly
haste
i
am
troubled
about
jasper
peyton
myself
yes
look
surprised
i
know
him
well
enough
to
call
him
that
we
all
know
one
another
in
medford
valley
i
i
even
work
for
him
sometimes
now
tell
me
what
you
think
is
wrong
oliver
as
he
set
forth
his
tale
had
a
feeling
that
not
all
of
it
was
new
to
his
listener
but
he
hearkened
attentively
to
all
that
the
boy
had
to
say
frowning
when
he
heard
of
anthony
crawford
insistent
and
disagreeable
visits
your
cousin
does
know
how
to
deal
with
a
man
like
that
he
commented
he
is
too
upright
himself
to
know
the
mean
small
underhand
ways
that
such
a
person
will
take
to
get
what
he
wants
i
know
anthony
crawford
too
and
what
he
is
trying
to
accomplish
it
will
take
all
of
us
every
one
to
beat
him
but
we
will
oliver
i
vow
we
will
what
can
we
do
what
can
i
do
the
boy
persisted
he
felt
ready
to
accomplish
great
things
at
once
and
ca
you
explain
to
me
what
it
is
all
about
to
his
great
disappointment
the
other
shook
his
head
i
feel
that
if
your
cousin
does
not
wish
to
tell
you
himself
i
ought
not
to
he
said
though
i
should
like
you
to
know
but
there
are
two
things
that
you
can
do
one
is
not
to
be
impatient
with
your
cousin
when
he
makes
tactless
mistakes
about
about
how
you
are
to
be
entertained
he
depends
on
you
and
janet
for
a
little
cheerfulness
in
his
house
that
is
much
to
do
observed
oliver
i
hope
the
other
is
more
it
is
only
this
to
borrow
a
boat
from
john
massey
can
you
manage
a
sailboat
good
i
thought
you
looked
like
the
sort
of
boy
who
could
and
take
a
cruise
up
and
down
medford
river
where
it
skirts
that
level
farming
land
in
the
valley
i
want
you
to
bring
me
word
of
how
the
dikes
are
holding
you
may
not
see
what
bearing
that
has
upon
the
matter
but
i
assure
you
it
means
a
great
deal
anthony
crawford
thinks
that
he
is
a
very
clever
man
but
he
is
preparing
a
pitfall
for
himself
unless
i
am
very
much
mistaken
and
you
and
i
may
be
at
hand
to
see
him
tumble
into
it
the
only
thing
is
to
see
that
he
harm
others
as
well
as
himself
oliver
had
one
more
question
to
ask
i
want
to
know
your
last
name
and
polly
he
said
i
ca
think
how
you
knew
mine
and
i
had
quite
forgotten
to
wonder
about
yours
until
janet
reminded
me
that
i
had
never
heard
it
i
have
no
name
for
you
but
the
beeman
if
you
want
a
longer
name
for
polly
you
can
call
her
polly
marshall
his
friend
answered
but
as
for
me
i
rather
like
being
called
the
beeman
we
will
keep
to
that
title
a
little
longer
if
you
are
willing
and
now
it
is
high
time
that
i
gave
some
attention
to
my
bees
oliver
had
no
difficulty
later
in
the
day
in
borrowing
the
sailboat
from
john
massey
although
he
was
obliged
to
give
the
vague
message
that
man
who
keeps
bees
up
the
hill
said
you
would
lend
her
to
me
sure
i
will
replied
john
massey
heartily
just
be
careful
you
do
go
aground
on
the
bars
the
river
is
shallow
for
this
time
of
year
though
it
can
be
pretty
fierce
when
the
floods
are
up
oliver
shook
out
the
shabby
sail
set
the
rudder
for
a
long
tack
downstream
and
was
off
the
breeze
was
coming
in
gentle
puffs
so
that
the
boat
moved
slowly
through
the
water
the
ripples
making
a
sleepy
whisper
under
the
bow
and
the
tiller
now
and
then
jerking
lazily
under
his
hand
one
side
of
the
stream
was
marshy
so
that
he
pushed
into
tall
grass
and
and
startled
an
indignant
kingfisher
who
was
dozing
on
a
dead
tree
the
bird
went
skimming
off
a
flash
of
blue
and
white
that
he
followed
as
he
came
about
on
the
other
side
the
current
ran
close
beside
the
high
banks
of
earth
that
protected
the
fields
within
the
channel
was
scoured
deep
and
the
restless
stream
was
cutting
into
the
dikes
washing
long
black
scars
just
above
the
water
line
that
ought
to
be
pronounced
oliver
and
was
glad
to
see
that
farther
downstream
the
carving
away
of
the
earth
had
been
stopped
by
patches
of
broken
stone
for
at
least
a
mile
however
at
the
bend
of
the
river
the
banks
were
crumbling
and
neglected
he
could
look
up
and
see
first
the
farms
of
the
land
the
treetops
and
pointed
silos
just
showing
above
the
dike
then
the
hillside
with
the
wavering
white
line
of
the
road
then
that
strange
shabby
dwelling
of
yellow
stone
almost
hidden
in
its
cluster
of
trees
above
it
showed
cousin
jasper
house
very
big
and
red
set
upon
the
slope
almost
at
the
top
of
the
ridge
on
the
other
side
of
the
stream
there
were
fewer
dwellings
the
wooded
slope
rising
to
the
more
open
green
of
the
orchard
and
then
to
the
grassy
declivity
of
the
windy
hill
as
he
neared
the
bridge
he
passed
a
long
gray
stone
house
with
its
gardens
a
glowing
mass
of
color
that
came
down
to
the
water
very
edge
this
he
remembered
was
the
abode
of
cousin
eleanor
and
he
laughed
at
himself
as
even
at
this
safe
distance
he
steered
his
course
very
cautiously
along
the
opposite
bank
at
the
bridge
he
was
obliged
to
turn
and
run
before
the
wind
to
make
his
way
upstream
again
he
lay
stretched
out
comfortably
along
the
rail
paying
little
attention
to
the
boat
and
thinking
of
many
things
there
was
cousin
jasper
how
oliver
had
misjudged
him
that
day
he
thought
of
running
away
his
cousin
had
been
tactless
and
stubborn
but
the
cousin
eleanor
affair
had
been
well
meant
after
all
i
never
meet
her
though
i
wo
give
in
he
declared
almost
aloud
and
realized
in
a
breath
that
his
persistence
and
cousin
jasper
were
both
cut
from
the
same
piece
i
sorry
for
him
and
i
help
him
he
told
himself
and
perhaps
he
will
learn
something
about
boys
after
a
while
and
there
was
anthony
crawford
he
flushed
again
as
he
thought
of
the
man
gleeful
delight
when
he
had
caught
him
looking
over
the
wall
what
power
could
he
have
and
what
was
the
disgrace
of
which
he
had
spoken
the
beeman
was
almost
as
mysterious
as
the
others
also
he
had
certainly
managed
to
evade
the
question
when
oliver
had
asked
his
name
the
only
one
that
there
is
a
mystery
about
is
polly
he
declared
as
he
came
to
john
massey
little
landing
and
rounded
with
a
sweep
to
the
boat
mooring
meanwhile
janet
who
had
been
left
to
her
own
devices
had
stumbled
into
an
adventure
of
her
own
she
had
made
ready
to
go
with
her
brother
but
cousin
jasper
had
called
her
to
look
at
some
new
roses
and
had
delayed
her
so
long
that
the
impatient
oliver
had
finally
gone
without
her
when
cousin
jasper
had
returned
to
the
house
she
wandered
rather
disconsolately
up
and
down
the
hedged
paths
and
finally
coming
to
the
big
gate
she
stood
looking
out
the
road
stretched
away
invitingly
across
the
hillsides
the
sleepy
stillness
of
the
afternoon
was
broken
only
by
the
occasional
drone
of
a
motor
and
by
the
grinding
wheels
of
a
big
hay
wagon
that
labored
along
the
highway
in
the
dust
she
walked
out
along
the
road
thinking
that
she
would
find
a
vantage
point
to
look
down
to
the
river
and
see
how
oliver
was
faring
the
way
presently
crossed
an
open
ridge
whence
she
could
see
the
smooth
stream
and
the
sail
creeping
slowly
out
from
the
green
shore
for
some
time
she
stood
watching
its
progress
wishing
vainly
that
she
might
have
gone
until
she
became
suddenly
aware
that
some
one
was
staring
at
her
turning
she
saw
that
a
child
with
very
yellow
hair
and
very
round
blue
eyes
was
sitting
between
two
alder
bushes
on
the
edge
of
a
ditch
gazing
at
her
intently
what
are
you
doing
she
asked
astonished
for
the
youngster
a
square
little
boy
of
four
or
five
years
old
seemed
far
too
small
to
be
on
the
road
alone
i
was
wishing
i
could
go
home
he
answered
there
was
a
slight
quivering
of
his
chin
as
he
spoke
as
though
the
problem
was
rather
a
desperate
one
but
he
was
determined
not
to
cry
i
was
wishing
on
that
hay
wagon
when
it
went
by
he
explained
sedately
i
shut
my
eyes
so
i
would
see
it
again
and
break
the
luck
and
when
i
opened
them
you
were
there
he
climbed
over
the
ditch
and
came
to
her
side
to
tuck
his
hand
confidently
into
hers
there
seemed
to
be
no
doubt
in
his
mind
that
she
would
take
him
home
can
you
show
me
where
you
live
she
asked
as
they
went
along
together
oh
yes
he
answered
cheerfully
there
was
a
cow
eating
beside
the
road
and
i
passed
it
once
but
it
looked
at
me
so
hard
when
i
went
by
that
i
was
afraid
to
go
back
i
show
you
they
walked
along
for
some
distance
he
tramping
sturdily
by
her
side
and
chattering
contentedly
giving
her
all
sorts
of
miscellaneous
and
unsought
information
that
his
name
was
martin
that
he
had
a
little
brother
that
the
brother
was
crying
when
he
went
away
from
home
that
his
mother
was
crying
a
little
too
that
they
had
a
red
calf
in
the
barn
and
that
there
was
a
scarecrow
in
the
field
beside
their
house
he
led
her
into
a
crossroad
then
down
a
narrow
shady
lane
where
as
he
had
said
there
was
a
mannerly
old
black
cow
grazing
beside
the
way
who
came
to
the
end
of
her
tether
rope
to
greet
them
i
not
afraid
with
you
here
young
martin
asserted
boldly
and
was
even
persuaded
to
pat
the
smooth
black
and
white
face
of
the
friendly
creature
while
janet
fed
her
a
handful
of
clover
when
they
reached
a
gate
at
the
end
of
the
lane
the
girl
began
to
realize
that
she
was
coming
to
the
same
place
that
oliver
had
described
to
her
she
stopped
feeling
that
she
would
rather
not
go
on
but
the
little
boy
tugged
at
her
hand
my
father
is
here
he
told
her
as
though
some
unhappy
knowledge
of
his
father
character
made
him
understand
her
hesitation
and
my
mother
crying
with
some
reluctance
janet
pushed
open
the
gate
and
went
in
a
faded
shabbily
dressed
woman
sat
on
one
of
the
unpainted
benches
of
the
shady
stoop
holding
a
baby
in
her
arms
as
martin
had
said
slow
tears
of
helpless
misery
were
rolling
down
her
cheeks
while
from
the
bundle
that
she
held
came
the
tired
wail
of
a
sick
child
i
do
know
much
but
i
would
like
to
help
you
janet
said
sitting
down
beside
her
while
the
woman
choked
with
a
fresh
gush
of
tears
at
the
unexpected
offer
of
aid
and
sympathy
i
do
dare
put
the
baby
down
he
cries
so
she
managed
to
say
at
last
could
you
go
into
the
kitchen
and
heat
some
water
and
bring
out
the
blanket
that
i
hung
up
to
warm
i
do
doubt
the
fire
is
out
by
now
but
i
have
been
able
to
move
for
fear
he
would
begin
choking
again
do
you
think
you
can
manage
janet
managed
very
well
with
martin
trotting
at
her
heels
to
tell
her
where
things
could
be
found
she
heated
the
water
warmed
the
blankets
and
even
rummaged
out
the
tea
caddy
and
brewed
a
cup
of
hot
tea
for
the
weary
mother
you
are
a
real
blessing
my
dear
said
the
woman
as
she
put
down
the
empty
cup
this
boy
has
been
sick
with
croup
all
night
and
i
had
quite
forgotten
that
i
had
no
breakfast
has
his
father
gone
for
the
doctor
janet
asked
as
she
brought
out
a
cushion
for
the
baby
who
seemed
to
be
quieter
now
and
almost
ready
to
drop
asleep
no
replied
the
woman
briefly
she
offered
no
explanation
it
was
evidently
not
a
thing
to
be
expected
that
anthony
crawford
should
take
an
interest
in
an
ailing
child
as
janet
went
back
and
forth
she
was
struck
by
the
surprising
charm
that
the
old
house
showed
within
quite
out
of
keeping
with
its
littered
and
outward
disrepair
the
white
woodwork
had
gone
long
unpainted
it
was
true
and
the
floors
were
worn
and
uneven
but
there
was
an
airy
spaciousness
in
the
rooms
a
comfortable
dignity
in
the
old
mahogany
furniture
and
the
grace
of
real
beauty
in
the
curved
white
staircase
with
its
dark
polished
rail
everything
was
spotlessly
clean
from
the
faded
rag
rugs
to
the
cracked
panes
of
the
windows
the
kitchen
was
to
her
the
place
of
chief
delight
for
it
ran
all
across
the
back
of
the
house
with
a
row
of
low
windows
wreathed
in
ivy
and
commanding
a
wide
view
across
the
meadow
lands
beside
the
river
there
was
a
modern
cooking
stove
at
one
end
of
the
room
a
cheap
hideous
ineffective
affair
but
at
the
other
was
still
the
old
fireplace
with
its
swinging
crane
its
warming
cupboards
and
its
broad
hearth
the
baby
was
so
much
better
that
his
mother
was
actually
able
to
smile
and
to
lean
back
contentedly
in
the
corner
of
the
bench
he
is
better
off
out
here
in
the
air
she
said
i
believe
he
will
be
able
to
sleep
in
a
little
while
now
if
i
just
had
a
strip
of
flannel
to
wrap
around
his
chest
you
would
have
to
go
up
into
the
garret
to
look
for
it
and
maybe
rummage
in
one
or
two
of
the
boxes
but
i
believe
there
should
be
some
in
the
big
cedar
chest
back
under
the
eaves
guided
by
the
faithful
martin
janet
climbed
the
stairs
to
the
garret
where
in
the
warm
dusty
air
that
smelled
of
hot
shingles
and
lavender
she
went
poking
about
seeking
the
roll
of
flannel
that
crawford
assured
her
was
there
she
could
find
everything
else
in
the
world
old
clocks
chairs
a
mahogany
sofa
and
a
spinning
wheel
at
last
she
discovered
what
she
needed
in
a
box
far
under
the
eaves
but
in
pulling
it
out
so
that
she
could
raise
the
lid
she
knocked
down
a
row
of
pictures
that
leaned
against
it
she
bent
to
pick
them
up
and
set
them
in
order
again
then
stopped
to
stare
at
them
with
a
gasp
of
delighted
astonishment
janet
loved
beautiful
things
especially
pictures
and
she
could
be
sure
at
one
glance
that
these
were
pictures
such
as
one
does
not
often
see
she
remembered
being
taken
by
her
father
to
a
famous
gallery
to
see
a
landscape
so
much
akin
to
the
one
before
her
that
they
had
undoubtedly
been
painted
by
the
same
artist
a
green
hillside
with
sailing
clouds
above
it
on
a
clear
october
day
the
sort
that
makes
you
feel
that
you
can
see
a
hundred
miles
as
janet
put
it
there
was
another
a
winding
white
road
running
up
a
valley
with
the
trees
bowing
to
a
storm
and
a
spatter
of
rain
slanting
across
the
hill
there
was
a
portrait
of
a
fierce
old
lady
and
another
of
a
man
with
lace
ruffles
and
a
satin
coat
there
was
a
long
cool
wave
breaking
upon
a
beach
where
the
whiteness
of
the
sand
was
so
vivid
as
almost
to
hurt
her
eyes
she
set
them
out
in
a
row
against
the
eaves
and
sat
back
on
her
heels
to
look
her
fill
such
pictures
to
be
gathered
here
in
the
dusty
attic
to
crack
and
warp
and
fade
into
ruin
she
could
not
understand
how
they
could
have
come
there
nor
did
she
spend
much
thought
in
wondering
so
lost
was
she
in
that
pure
delight
that
the
sight
of
truly
beautiful
things
can
bring
an
old
print
with
a
cracked
glass
and
broken
frame
caught
her
attention
almost
the
last
of
all
it
showed
a
ship
a
tall
frigate
under
full
sail
and
had
all
the
quaint
primness
of
the
pictures
of
a
hundred
years
ago
the
group
of
people
supposed
to
be
standing
on
the
wharf
was
composed
of
gentlemen
in
very
tight
trousers
and
ladies
with
very
sloping
shoulders
and
absurd
tiny
parasols
the
vessel
floated
on
impossible
scalloped
billows
but
no
stiffness
could
disguise
the
free
beauty
of
the
lines
and
the
grace
of
her
curving
sails
her
name
was
inscribed
in
faded
gold
letters
below
the
the
beeman
tale
was
still
so
vivid
in
her
mind
that
there
was
no
need
for
her
to
wonder
where
she
had
heard
that
name
before
why
it
was
a
real
story
she
exclaimed
and
i
thought
he
was
only
making
it
up
as
she
moved
the
print
to
a
better
light
a
smaller
picture
almost
lost
among
the
rest
fell
down
between
two
frames
and
rolled
across
the
floor
she
took
it
up
and
saw
that
it
was
a
miniature
painted
on
ivory
and
framed
in
gold
the
portrait
of
a
young
girl
with
brown
hair
and
eager
smiling
eyes
it
looks
like
polly
janet
thought
but
it
could
not
really
be
a
picture
of
her
she
turned
it
over
and
found
the
single
name
engraved
on
the
back
cicely
æt
martin
she
cried
in
the
sudden
inspiration
of
discovery
martin
come
here
quickly
and
tell
me
what
is
your
whole
name
the
little
boy
came
out
from
a
far
corner
where
he
had
been
examining
dusty
treasures
on
his
own
account
and
stood
for
a
minute
just
where
a
beam
of
slanting
sunlight
dropped
through
the
tiny
window
under
the
roof
martin
hallowell
crawford
he
said
she
would
always
remember
just
how
he
looked
standing
there
with
the
sunshine
on
his
yellow
mop
of
curly
hair
his
chubby
face
smiling
and
then
whitening
suddenly
as
they
both
heard
a
sound
behind
them
she
turned
to
see
anthony
crawford
standing
upon
the
stair
chapter
vii
the
portrait
of
cicely
if
janet
had
needed
any
further
clue
to
anthony
crawford
character
she
would
have
had
it
in
the
sudden
trembling
terror
of
his
little
son
she
was
shaking
herself
yet
she
mustered
an
outward
appearance
of
courage
for
a
moment
as
she
turned
to
face
him
squarely
and
to
hear
his
biting
words
first
the
brother
peering
over
the
wall
then
the
sister
rummaging
through
my
house
did
jasper
peyton
send
you
here
to
find
where
i
kept
the
picture
of
cicely
hallowell
that
he
was
so
reluctant
to
give
up
to
me
i
did
know
it
was
cicely
hallowell
returned
janet
trying
to
speak
steadily
i
did
even
know
that
she
was
a
real
person
i
thought
she
was
just
some
one
in
a
story
then
as
crawford
stepped
nearer
as
little
martin
gave
a
sudden
squeak
of
alarm
blind
panic
took
possession
of
her
she
ran
toward
the
stairs
and
though
the
man
put
out
his
arm
to
intercept
her
she
dodged
under
it
with
undignified
agility
and
plunged
down
the
steps
they
were
of
the
broad
shallow
kind
that
made
her
feel
for
all
her
speed
that
she
would
never
reach
the
bottom
yet
she
came
at
last
into
the
hall
below
and
out
upon
the
stoop
she
fled
past
crawford
sitting
with
the
sleeping
baby
across
her
lap
and
looking
up
anxiously
with
good
cause
for
misgiving
since
she
had
heard
her
husband
go
up
the
stair
it
was
only
when
she
was
safely
outside
the
gate
that
janet
stopped
to
draw
breath
to
realize
how
her
knees
were
trembling
and
how
her
heart
was
pounding
yet
it
stopped
suddenly
and
seemed
to
miss
a
beat
when
she
realized
something
further
that
she
still
held
in
her
hand
the
miniature
of
cicely
hallowell
can
i
go
back
she
wondered
desperately
but
knew
instantly
that
she
could
never
find
courage
to
do
so
she
went
on
hurrying
and
stumbling
as
she
made
her
way
down
the
lane
only
once
she
ventured
to
look
over
her
shoulder
and
saw
anthony
crawford
standing
on
the
doorstep
staring
after
her
while
the
scarecrow
that
was
so
vaguely
like
him
seemed
to
be
lifting
its
arm
in
a
mocking
gesture
of
farewell
janet
and
oliver
held
an
anxious
conference
that
evening
as
they
sat
on
the
terrace
for
until
that
moment
they
had
not
been
alone
together
she
brought
out
the
miniature
and
told
of
the
astonishing
and
disturbing
manner
in
which
it
had
come
into
her
possession
while
oliver
wondered
in
frank
dismay
how
it
was
to
be
restored
to
its
owner
i
ca
think
how
i
came
to
carry
it
away
with
me
wailed
janet
of
course
it
was
clutched
tight
in
my
hand
and
i
was
so
frightened
that
i
did
think
of
anything
but
getting
away
i
thought
of
putting
it
down
on
the
grass
by
the
gate
but
it
is
too
valuable
to
risk
being
lost
like
that
and
that
man
will
say
i
stole
it
i
do
know
what
to
do
we
shall
have
to
give
it
back
to
him
said
oliver
firmly
we
will
but
he
stopped
in
the
middle
of
his
sentence
unable
even
in
imagination
to
contemplate
facing
anthony
crawford
and
giving
him
the
miniature
shall
we
tell
cousin
jasper
janet
suggested
but
oliver
declared
against
it
anthony
crawford
will
be
quite
ready
to
say
that
cousin
jasper
sent
you
to
get
it
from
him
the
miniature
and
the
pictures
seem
to
be
part
of
the
trouble
though
i
do
understand
why
so
if
that
man
comes
here
with
such
an
accusation
it
would
be
better
for
cousin
jasper
to
be
able
to
say
he
knew
nothing
about
it
yes
assented
janet
i
believe
if
he
knew
cousin
jasper
would
try
to
shield
us
and
anthony
crawford
would
use
it
as
one
more
thing
to
hold
over
him
i
am
beginning
to
understand
both
of
them
better
we
we
have
overlooked
a
good
many
things
about
cousin
jasper
it
was
only
a
few
minutes
later
that
cousin
jasper
joined
them
nor
had
he
yet
sat
down
in
the
long
wicker
chair
that
oliver
placed
for
him
before
hotchkiss
came
out
with
a
message
john
massey
is
in
the
kitchen
sir
and
he
says
to
tell
you
that
he
would
like
to
see
you
about
something
important
bring
him
out
here
cousin
jasper
directed
and
when
the
somewhat
embarrassed
visitor
in
his
worn
best
clothes
appeared
upon
the
terrace
he
got
up
with
as
elaborate
courtesy
as
he
would
have
accorded
the
most
distinguished
guest
what
is
it
john
he
asked
for
the
sunburned
farmer
was
evidently
an
old
acquaintance
the
other
burst
out
with
his
news
and
his
errand
at
once
i
been
turned
off
sir
he
said
told
to
leave
the
farm
with
no
notice
at
all
and
my
crops
all
in
the
ground
i
admit
i
a
little
behind
on
my
rent
but
not
many
landlords
around
here
collect
as
closely
as
crawford
does
they
get
all
their
money
at
the
end
of
the
season
and
do
haggle
over
it
month
by
month
when
the
farmer
has
nothing
coming
in
and
what
can
you
do
on
land
that
never
improved
he
lets
the
place
run
down
and
then
turns
me
out
because
i
ca
make
a
fortune
for
him
on
it
i
i
was
wondering
if
you
could
do
something
for
me
sir
do
something
for
you
echoed
jasper
peyton
i
ca
use
any
influence
with
anthony
crawford
if
that
is
what
you
wish
i
do
understand
it
the
man
persisted
three
years
ago
you
were
my
landlord
and
none
of
us
ever
had
dealings
with
anthony
crawford
except
that
we
used
to
know
him
when
he
was
a
boy
the
whole
bottom
land
along
the
river
was
yours
and
all
your
tenants
were
farming
it
for
a
fair
rent
and
every
one
was
satisfied
but
then
he
comes
and
the
upper
half
is
his
we
hear
and
it
is
bad
luck
for
us
as
we
soon
know
everything
runs
down
no
one
is
treated
fairly
and
here
i
am
turned
off
at
a
word
and
all
his
doing
could
you
make
room
for
me
farther
down
the
river
somewhere
sir
where
the
land
is
yours
he
looked
so
red
and
anxious
and
unhappy
that
janet
heart
was
fairly
wrung
for
him
his
wife
was
ailing
she
knew
the
season
was
backward
and
here
he
stood
facing
the
loss
of
all
his
work
and
the
necessity
of
beginning
all
over
again
she
waited
eagerly
to
hear
what
offer
cousin
jasper
would
make
i
i
ca
help
you
john
he
said
at
last
very
slowly
and
heavily
even
if
i
made
room
for
you
on
one
of
the
lower
farms
it
would
only
stir
up
trouble
and
you
might
wake
up
some
day
to
find
that
anthony
crawford
was
your
landlord
again
after
all
i
can
give
you
the
money
to
pay
your
rent
if
you
wish
to
stay
where
you
are
but
that
is
all
that
i
can
do
there
are
times
when
we
are
none
of
us
free
agents
or
masters
of
our
own
affairs
i
do
care
to
stay
on
sir
john
massey
returned
i
had
too
many
words
with
anthony
crawford
for
things
ever
to
go
easy
again
i
been
patching
up
the
dike
with
my
own
spare
time
and
maybe
the
farm
has
suffered
by
my
doing
it
anyway
he
says
so
and
calls
me
a
fool
i
thought
perhaps
you
would
help
me
since
i
been
your
tenant
so
long
before
came
his
voice
dragging
with
disappointment
trailed
lower
and
lower
i
do
seem
to
know
just
where
to
turn
well
good
night
to
you
sir
he
turned
and
walked
heavily
away
they
sat
very
silent
after
he
was
gone
oliver
was
leaning
against
the
terrace
rail
janet
in
her
big
chair
was
clenching
her
hands
in
her
lap
cousin
jasper
with
his
hands
on
the
railing
stood
in
absolute
quiet
staring
out
over
the
garden
the
light
of
the
house
came
through
the
long
windows
falling
on
his
face
that
was
so
pale
and
tired
he
had
seemed
weary
and
unhappy
for
some
time
but
he
looked
desperate
the
minutes
passed
but
still
he
stood
in
silence
staring
straight
before
him
the
sight
of
his
distress
seemed
more
than
either
of
the
two
could
bear
oliver
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
but
stood
dumbly
helpless
while
janet
moved
closer
to
their
cousin
and
spoke
with
shy
hesitation
could
we
help
you
wo
you
tell
us
what
you
are
thinking
i
was
only
thinking
cousin
jasper
answered
very
slowly
i
was
wondering
as
i
do
sometimes
lately
how
strangely
life
can
change
and
twist
itself
and
make
things
seem
other
than
they
should
be
if
you
have
lived
all
your
years
following
your
own
sense
of
honor
if
you
have
tried
in
everything
you
do
to
be
fair
and
just
how
can
it
be
when
the
years
have
passed
that
suddenly
all
the
results
of
honest
dealing
should
be
swept
away
how
can
it
be
that
a
man
who
has
disgraced
himself
whose
ways
are
known
to
be
everything
that
is
devious
and
unfair
how
can
he
gain
power
over
you
threaten
to
take
from
you
everything
that
is
yours
even
say
that
he
can
destroy
your
good
name
how
can
every
effort
you
make
toward
a
fair
settlement
only
render
matters
worse
is
there
really
something
so
wrong
with
the
world
that
a
dishonest
man
can
work
more
harm
than
a
man
of
honor
can
ever
undo
do
think
so
he
concluded
turning
to
regard
them
from
under
his
knitted
brows
as
if
he
must
in
his
distress
find
some
word
of
reassurance
somewhere
no
said
oliver
emphatically
finding
his
voice
somewhat
to
his
own
surprise
i
do
think
so
at
all
i
believe
a
man
who
does
dishonorable
things
can
can
mix
you
up
and
make
you
miserable
but
he
ca
go
on
forever
his
plans
are
bound
to
come
to
grief
in
the
end
his
halting
words
carried
the
real
earnestness
of
conviction
they
seemed
to
give
cousin
jasper
some
sort
of
comfort
for
his
face
relaxed
he
moved
from
his
tense
attitude
and
turned
to
walk
up
and
down
the
terrace
through
the
patches
of
light
and
shadow
that
lay
between
the
windows
janet
thrust
a
friendly
affectionate
hand
under
his
arm
as
she
walked
beside
him
it
was
a
hot
night
at
june
very
highest
tide
with
the
garden
at
the
summit
of
its
beauty
the
madonna
lilies
were
in
bloom
showing
ghostly
white
through
the
dark
rows
and
ranks
and
armies
of
them
all
up
and
down
the
walks
and
borders
sending
sudden
ripples
of
sweetness
upward
to
the
terrace
whenever
the
faint
breeze
stirred
there
was
no
moon
yet
but
the
stars
were
thick
overhead
and
the
moving
lanterns
of
the
fireflies
glimmered
among
the
trees
low
down
still
as
they
always
are
in
the
first
hours
of
the
dark
janet
was
thinking
that
when
the
world
was
so
beautiful
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
things
could
go
entirely
wrong
in
it
but
she
did
not
find
it
possible
to
put
her
idea
into
words
it
may
have
been
that
cousin
jasper
was
thinking
the
same
thing
as
he
stopped
and
stood
for
a
long
time
at
the
head
of
the
stair
leading
down
from
the
end
of
the
terrace
into
the
garden
at
last
he
began
to
descend
slowly
unable
to
make
out
the
steps
in
the
dark
so
that
he
put
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
to
steady
himself
he
spoke
very
suddenly
it
is
not
only
in
body
but
in
spirit
that
the
old
must
sometimes
lean
upon
the
young
he
said
and
then
with
his
voice
quite
cheerful
again
began
to
talk
of
how
well
the
flowers
were
doing
this
year
oliver
had
followed
them
to
the
top
of
the
stair
and
stood
above
them
listening
but
not
apparently
to
what
cousin
jasper
was
saying
his
head
was
bent
and
he
was
straining
every
nerve
to
hear
some
sound
his
face
looked
troubled
then
cleared
suddenly
as
he
came
down
the
steps
cousin
jasper
he
said
did
i
tell
you
that
the
gardener
wanted
you
to
know
that
the
cereus
is
open
just
now
suppose
we
walk
out
to
the
back
of
the
garden
and
see
it
his
cousin
hesitated
it
is
rather
late
he
answered
it
will
be
open
still
night
janet
has
never
seen
one
persisted
oliver
putting
a
firm
arm
through
cousin
jasper
and
it
might
rain
or
something
night
she
would
be
so
disappointed
and
so
would
the
gardener
they
went
down
the
last
steps
together
into
the
sea
of
white
lilies
and
drifting
fragrance
and
disappeared
into
the
darkness
toward
the
back
of
the
garden
in
spite
of
his
insistence
oliver
did
not
seem
so
deeply
interested
as
the
others
in
the
plant
that
was
slowly
opening
its
pink
flowers
that
have
so
brief
and
beautiful
a
season
the
gardener
hastily
summoned
came
across
the
lawn
to
exhibit
his
favorite
plant
with
the
greatest
pride
but
oliver
left
the
others
to
admire
and
ask
questions
and
in
ten
minutes
came
back
alone
coming
upon
the
terrace
again
he
saw
hotchkiss
just
inside
the
long
window
ushering
out
a
visitor
who
was
talking
in
loud
easily
recognizable
tones
no
he
does
seem
to
be
here
anthony
crawford
was
saying
though
i
did
believe
you
until
you
let
me
come
in
and
see
for
myself
i
had
something
of
great
importance
to
say
to
him
and
to
the
girl
well
i
will
come
again
he
passed
down
the
room
and
must
have
come
very
close
to
the
light
for
his
shadow
loomed
suddenly
misshapen
and
bulky
all
across
the
library
even
dropping
its
black
length
over
the
terrace
outside
it
followed
him
a
striding
giant
from
window
to
window
and
then
dwindled
suddenly
again
as
anthony
crawford
himself
stood
under
the
light
in
the
doorway
giving
hotchkiss
final
directions
be
sure
to
tell
him
that
i
shall
be
here
night
and
that
i
shall
expect
him
to
be
at
home
he
ordered
then
climbed
into
the
creaking
cart
and
drove
away
hotchkiss
stood
peering
into
the
dark
after
him
evidently
sending
no
good
wishes
to
speed
him
homeward
seeing
oliver
coming
up
the
steps
at
the
far
end
of
the
terrace
he
walked
down
to
speak
to
him
there
was
something
more
than
usual
wrong
he
said
anxiously
he
vowed
that
he
must
see
peyton
and
did
want
to
take
my
word
for
it
that
he
was
out
it
was
fortunate
that
he
had
gone
into
the
garden
yes
responded
oliver
i
thought
i
heard
that
miserable
rattletrap
turning
in
at
the
gate
and
i
remembered
all
of
a
sudden
that
the
gardener
told
me
yesterday
about
the
cereus
i
i
thought
they
ought
to
look
at
it
at
once
hotchkiss
had
been
nervous
and
agitated
during
what
must
have
been
a
stormy
interview
and
he
found
this
sudden
relief
too
great
for
the
composure
even
of
a
butler
he
burst
into
a
great
laugh
of
delight
and
slapped
his
knee
in
ecstasy
that
was
the
way
to
serve
him
he
cried
to
think
that
prying
scoundrel
found
some
one
that
was
too
clever
for
him
for
once
oliver
grinned
broadly
but
recovered
himself
in
a
moment
hotchkiss
he
said
with
great
gravity
you
would
never
do
for
the
movies
janet
was
eating
her
breakfast
very
deliberately
next
morning
lingering
even
after
cousin
jasper
had
left
them
and
while
oliver
sat
back
in
his
chair
fidgeting
in
frank
impatience
when
her
brother
finally
urged
her
to
make
haste
she
broke
forth
into
an
explanation
that
was
almost
a
wail
it
is
because
i
ca
forget
where
we
have
to
go
she
declared
oh
why
why
did
i
make
such
a
terrible
mistake
and
carry
that
miserable
picture
away
even
oliver
looked
none
too
cheerful
at
the
prospect
before
them
we
have
to
do
it
he
agreed
but
i
think
we
will
go
over
to
the
windy
hill
first
i
promised
polly
father
i
would
tell
him
what
i
saw
from
the
boat
but
after
that
there
will
be
plenty
of
time
and
we
will
go
to
anthony
crawford
i
ought
to
go
alone
janet
said
for
it
was
i
who
made
the
trouble
and
shall
we
tell
the
beeman
not
until
afterward
replied
oliver
if
there
is
difficulty
about
the
picture
it
would
be
easier
if
no
one
were
concerned
but
just
ourselves
and
indeed
you
wo
go
alone
we
are
in
this
thing
together
it
had
rained
in
the
night
so
heavily
that
the
clumps
of
larkspur
and
more
tender
plants
were
beaten
down
and
only
the
lilies
lifted
their
wet
shining
faces
above
the
green
the
sky
was
still
overcast
with
threats
of
another
downpour
yet
the
two
put
on
their
raincoats
and
set
forth
undeterred
there
is
an
old
apple
shed
in
the
corner
of
the
orchard
where
we
can
leave
the
car
said
oliver
polly
showed
me
last
time
where
we
could
drive
in
the
highway
was
smooth
and
wet
and
the
river
was
perceptibly
higher
under
the
bridge
they
pressed
onward
up
the
road
drove
through
the
gap
in
the
orchard
wall
and
felt
their
way
along
the
open
lane
between
the
apple
trees
the
car
was
finally
housed
in
the
shelter
of
the
shed
and
janet
and
oliver
raced
up
the
hill
for
the
first
drops
of
a
new
shower
were
just
beginning
to
fall
and
polly
in
the
doorway
of
the
cottage
was
beckoning
them
to
make
haste
the
downpour
was
a
sharp
one
that
pattered
on
the
roof
ran
streaming
from
the
eaves
and
blotted
out
the
hills
opposite
the
grass
and
the
orchard
however
seemed
to
grow
greener
every
moment
under
the
refreshing
rain
and
the
clumps
of
pink
hollyhocks
that
crowded
about
the
doorstep
lifted
their
heads
gratefully
we
ca
do
much
with
the
bees
for
an
hour
or
two
observed
the
beeman
sitting
down
in
the
corner
with
his
pipe
now
tell
me
what
you
saw
on
the
river
oliver
i
noticed
your
sail
and
knew
that
you
were
out
oliver
made
his
report
upon
the
scouring
banks
while
the
beeman
listened
and
nodded
gravely
that
is
something
we
must
look
into
he
declared
it
is
like
anthony
to
have
let
things
go
and
now
if
you
have
time
to
wait
suppose
we
have
a
story
they
had
ample
time
they
assured
him
being
only
too
glad
to
postpone
the
errand
that
must
come
later
they
were
eager
for
another
tale
moreover
for
they
were
beginning
to
realize
that
these
were
not
mere
haphazard
narratives
but
stories
with
some
definite
bearing
upon
the
places
and
people
about
them
we
have
plenty
of
time
oliver
assured
him
we
are
in
no
hurry
at
all
you
might
even
make
it
a
very
long
one
the
beeman
nodded
assent
with
that
queer
smile
that
seemed
to
betray
an
uncanny
understanding
of
the
whole
situation
a
long
one
it
shall
be
he
agreed
for
i
have
a
good
deal
to
tell
you
chapter
viii
the
fiddler
of
apple
tree
lane
people
said
that
the
brighton
children
could
never
manage
when
it
was
said
that
they
were
planning
to
live
in
the
little
cottage
on
the
hill
above
medford
valley
there
always
a
wind
there
from
the
sea
dearie
said
old
granny
fullerton
to
barbara
brighton
it
will
search
out
your
very
bones
come
winter
barbara
shook
her
head
cheerfully
a
plump
and
rosy
young
person
of
twelve
years
old
does
not
worry
much
about
cold
winds
people
said
also
with
the
strange
blindness
of
those
who
can
live
close
by
for
years
and
yet
never
know
what
is
in
their
hearts
that
it
was
an
odd
thing
that
howard
brighton
should
have
built
that
little
house
so
far
from
the
town
in
the
midst
of
that
great
stretch
of
wild
land
where
so
few
folk
lived
it
is
marshy
in
the
valley
and
wooded
on
the
hills
granny
fullerton
said
to
barbara
with
never
a
neighbor
for
miles
of
course
the
land
has
been
in
your
family
time
out
of
mind
but
those
that
are
your
nearest
kin
have
always
lived
in
the
town
what
could
howard
brighton
have
been
thinking
to
do
such
a
thing
they
did
not
know
how
he
had
toiled
and
planned
in
his
narrow
little
office
down
near
the
wharves
of
the
seaport
town
how
he
and
his
wife
had
dreamed
together
that
their
three
children
should
live
in
some
other
place
than
on
the
cramped
stony
street
where
they
had
been
born
after
his
wife
death
he
had
still
gone
forward
with
his
dream
and
when
he
found
that
he
had
himself
not
very
long
to
live
he
had
made
haste
to
build
the
cottage
that
they
had
so
greatly
desired
it
is
pleasure
enough
to
think
of
the
children
having
it
he
said
to
a
neighbor
who
remonstrated
with
him
on
the
ground
that
he
could
never
live
there
the
boys
will
be
old
enough
to
care
for
their
sister
and
the
house
on
the
hill
will
be
just
the
place
for
a
little
maid
to
grow
up
his
children
were
of
widely
separated
ages
for
ralph
the
eldest
was
felix
seventeen
and
barbara
as
has
been
said
only
twelve
it
happened
also
that
they
had
not
all
of
them
the
same
tastes
for
while
the
two
younger
ones
loved
the
country
and
looked
forward
to
living
on
the
windy
hill
ralph
desire
was
to
go
on
working
in
the
dusty
office
where
he
had
already
begun
to
prosper
he
is
a
good
getter
but
a
poor
spender
the
neighbors
said
and
in
this
were
right
ralph
with
his
first
success
had
begun
to
think
too
much
of
money
and
too
little
of
other
things
in
the
end
the
cottage
was
never
finished
only
the
main
portion
a
tiny
dwelling
was
completed
without
the
two
broad
wings
with
which
howard
brighton
had
meant
to
enlarge
it
and
which
he
did
not
live
to
build
when
their
father
had
gone
from
them
his
children
found
that
he
had
left
everything
he
had
to
ralph
since
the
laws
of
years
ago
made
some
difficulty
over
property
being
held
by
those
who
were
not
of
age
ralph
has
a
wise
head
on
his
young
shoulders
and
will
know
how
to
take
good
care
of
the
younger
ones
was
the
comment
of
busy
tongues
perhaps
ralph
heard
them
with
the
result
that
he
felt
older
and
wiser
than
he
really
was
but
of
that
no
one
can
be
sure
it
was
on
a
clear
warm
day
of
when
they
moved
from
the
airless
street
of
the
town
to
their
new
dwelling
on
the
hill
it
looks
like
home
already
barbara
said
as
they
came
up
to
the
door
for
with
its
wide
low
roof
its
broad
windows
and
its
swinging
half
doors
that
let
in
the
sunshine
and
the
fresh
breezes
it
seemed
indeed
a
place
in
which
to
forget
their
sadness
and
to
find
a
new
happy
life
the
rustling
voice
of
the
oak
tree
above
seemed
to
be
bidding
them
welcome
and
a
tall
clump
of
hollyhocks
by
the
shell
pink
and
white
seemed
to
have
come
into
bloom
that
very
day
just
for
their
barbara
ran
from
room
to
room
exclaiming
in
delight
over
the
new
freedom
while
the
two
brothers
sat
on
the
doorstep
to
look
down
over
their
new
domain
and
to
talk
of
the
future
their
father
had
planned
to
turn
the
meadow
below
into
an
orchard
and
had
even
managed
to
set
out
the
first
half
of
the
little
trees
slim
tiny
saplings
that
dotted
the
sloping
green
we
will
put
in
the
others
next
autumn
and
spring
felix
said
and
i
will
be
building
new
cupboards
and
shelves
for
old
chloe
in
the
kitchen
i
will
mend
the
press
in
barbara
room
and
i
will
finish
off
the
garret
chamber
under
the
eaves
for
myself
and
there
i
can
play
the
fiddle
to
my
heart
content
and
never
disturb
you
at
all
i
think
that
life
will
be
very
pleasant
here
so
their
lives
swung
into
the
new
channel
with
chloe
barbara
old
nurse
to
cook
for
them
and
with
felix
to
tend
the
apple
trees
and
the
little
garden
to
saw
and
hammer
and
whistle
all
day
at
the
task
of
setting
the
new
place
in
order
it
a
pity
you
have
a
proper
handsome
house
with
long
windows
from
the
ceiling
to
the
floor
and
a
high
roof
and
a
carved
front
door
and
with
black
marble
chimneypieces
instead
of
these
rough
stone
fireplaces
chloe
would
sigh
for
she
thought
that
the
elegance
of
that
time
was
none
too
good
for
the
people
she
loved
it
may
be
that
ralph
sighed
with
her
but
felix
and
barbara
were
frankly
delighted
with
the
painted
floors
the
casement
windows
and
the
low
rooms
in
the
evenings
as
the
two
would
sit
on
the
wide
doorstep
the
voice
of
felix
violin
would
mingle
with
the
voice
of
the
wind
in
the
oak
while
barbara
listened
entranced
for
her
brother
was
a
real
master
of
his
instrument
it
would
laugh
and
sing
and
sigh
while
barbara
pressed
closer
and
closer
to
his
knee
while
the
stars
came
out
and
the
evening
breeze
stirred
the
hollyhocks
and
the
great
branches
of
the
oak
tree
ralph
rode
every
day
to
the
town
to
labor
over
heavy
account
books
in
his
cramped
little
office
and
he
always
brought
home
a
sheaf
of
papers
under
his
arm
he
would
sit
at
the
table
inside
the
window
in
the
candlelight
and
as
the
music
rose
outside
singing
to
the
child
and
the
flowers
and
the
stars
he
would
scowl
and
fidget
and
tap
irritably
on
the
table
with
the
point
of
his
pen
for
he
did
not
love
his
brother
playing
there
is
too
much
time
spent
on
it
he
would
say
when
you
might
be
doing
useful
things
i
have
no
head
for
adding
up
your
endless
columns
of
dollars
and
cents
felix
would
answer
so
i
must
make
myself
useful
in
my
own
way
a
warm
golden
october
had
painted
the
valley
with
blazing
colors
had
turned
the
oak
tree
to
ruddy
bronze
and
had
afforded
ideal
weather
for
the
further
planting
of
the
orchard
here
felix
was
at
work
with
barbara
following
at
his
heels
and
helping
when
each
tree
was
planted
to
hold
it
upright
while
he
pressed
down
the
earth
about
its
roots
we
will
leave
an
open
space
through
the
center
he
said
a
lane
that
will
lead
straight
up
toward
the
house
so
that
when
ralph
and
i
come
home
we
can
look
up
to
the
open
door
and
the
hollyhocks
around
the
step
only
he
shook
his
head
regretfully
i
am
afraid
ralph
wo
see
the
flowers
his
head
is
too
full
of
dollar
signs
when
he
comes
home
from
the
town
barbara
turned
about
to
look
through
the
orchard
some
one
came
trudging
along
between
the
little
trees
his
heavy
tired
feet
crunching
in
the
leaves
oh
it
a
peddler
she
cried
eagerly
for
she
was
always
pleased
when
these
traveling
merchants
came
past
with
their
laces
and
gay
embroideries
and
colored
beads
to
dazzle
the
eyes
of
little
girls
but
this
was
a
peddler
of
another
sort
a
man
with
melting
black
eyes
and
eager
speech
that
was
less
than
half
of
it
english
he
was
an
immigrant
italian
newly
come
to
this
great
america
he
managed
to
explain
and
he
was
trying
to
sell
the
trinkets
and
small
household
treasures
that
he
had
brought
with
him
they
led
him
up
to
the
house
for
he
was
weary
and
hungry
and
while
barbara
brought
him
food
felix
was
plying
him
with
questions
as
to
where
he
had
come
from
and
whither
he
was
going
he
had
meant
to
settle
down
in
the
little
seaport
so
he
told
them
but
here
he
became
so
voluble
that
it
was
almost
impossible
to
understand
him
he
did
not
wish
to
stop
there
now
he
must
go
on
on
it
is
the
gold
he
cried
excitedly
making
wide
gestures
with
both
his
brown
hands
the
beautiful
yellow
gold
they
find
it
everywhere
he
brought
out
a
tattered
newspaper
to
let
them
see
for
themselves
what
he
could
not
explain
news
traveled
slowly
in
those
days
so
that
in
this
corner
of
medford
valley
the
brother
and
sister
now
heard
for
the
first
time
of
the
discovery
of
gold
in
california
yet
in
the
towns
and
where
people
could
gather
to
tell
one
another
stories
the
world
was
rapidly
going
mad
over
tales
of
gold
lying
loose
for
the
gathering
of
nuggets
as
big
as
a
fist
of
rivers
running
yellow
with
the
precious
shining
dust
listen
barbara
why
it
ca
be
true
cried
felix
as
he
read
aloud
the
italian
interrupting
excitedly
trying
to
tell
them
more
it
was
for
this
that
he
had
abandoned
his
plans
that
he
was
selling
everything
he
had
to
follow
a
far
golden
dream
across
the
country
to
california
a
terrible
journey
they
say
he
admitted
but
what
does
one
care
with
such
fortune
at
the
other
end
he
had
little
left
to
sell
nor
had
they
much
money
to
buy
but
so
carried
away
were
they
by
his
ardor
they
would
have
given
him
anything
they
had
there
was
a
carved
ivory
crucifix
a
silver
chain
and
at
the
very
bottom
of
his
bag
a
square
box
that
gave
forth
a
curious
humming
noise
take
care
he
cautioned
as
barbara
would
have
peeped
within
they
fly
away
the
bees
bees
she
echoed
in
astonishment
yes
he
had
brought
all
the
way
to
america
a
queen
bee
and
her
retinue
of
workers
for
italian
bees
he
told
them
gravely
were
known
the
world
over
for
their
beauty
industry
and
gentleness
they
sting
you
only
if
you
hurt
them
he
declared
other
times
never
he
explained
how
they
were
to
be
put
into
a
hive
and
just
how
they
were
to
be
tended
for
he
was
wise
in
the
bee
lore
of
italy
felix
had
seen
some
of
the
farmers
round
about
struggling
with
the
wild
black
bees
whose
tempers
were
so
vicious
that
the
only
way
to
gather
their
honey
was
to
smoke
the
whole
hiveful
to
death
the
man
opened
the
box
a
little
way
to
let
the
creatures
crawl
over
his
fingers
to
show
their
gentleness
i
must
sell
them
quick
he
said
for
they
live
not
much
longer
in
a
box
they
bought
the
bees
felix
and
barbara
though
it
took
every
penny
they
had
in
the
house
and
even
the
store
in
the
little
carved
box
on
the
mantel
which
they
were
all
saving
by
ralph
advice
against
a
rainy
day
the
man
went
away
down
through
the
orchard
turning
to
wave
his
ragged
hat
in
joyful
for
now
he
had
sold
everything
and
was
off
and
away
to
california
felix
sat
on
the
doorstep
watching
him
go
while
barbara
moved
about
inside
laying
the
table
for
supper
a
thought
suddenly
struck
her
and
she
went
to
the
door
felix
she
said
i
wonder
what
ralph
will
say
but
felix
was
not
listening
gold
he
repeated
softly
did
you
hear
what
he
said
barbara
the
sands
of
the
rivers
yellow
with
it
the
indians
giving
their
children
nuggets
to
play
with
a
year
earnings
to
be
picked
up
in
a
day
he
was
so
lost
in
his
dream
that
he
could
talk
of
nothing
else
it
was
not
the
sort
of
gold
that
ralph
loved
minted
coins
that
could
be
saved
and
counted
and
stacked
away
but
it
was
the
shining
treasure
of
romance
wealth
that
unlike
dully
satisfying
riches
meant
battle
and
adventure
and
triumph
after
overwhelming
odds
he
did
at
last
consent
to
help
barbara
house
the
bees
in
a
suitable
dwelling
but
he
talked
still
of
the
tale
he
had
heard
and
his
eyes
were
shining
with
the
wonder
of
it
did
you
hear
him
say
that
there
was
just
one
beaten
trail
across
the
plains
all
the
way
from
the
mississippi
to
california
think
of
a
road
a
single
road
two
thousand
miles
long
reaching
out
through
the
wilderness
over
the
deserts
through
the
mountains
with
no
towns
or
houses
or
people
just
one
lonely
highway
and
gold
at
the
far
end
ralph
was
late
that
evening
late
and
tired
and
impatient
after
an
unsatisfactory
day
he
brushed
past
felix
still
sitting
on
the
step
flung
down
his
bundle
of
papers
and
went
over
to
the
fire
the
little
carved
money
box
stood
open
on
the
mantel
revealing
its
emptiness
what
is
this
he
asked
barbara
sternly
as
she
stood
in
the
corner
twisting
her
apron
and
finding
suddenly
that
it
was
very
difficult
to
explain
felix
came
in
the
light
of
excitement
still
on
his
face
eager
to
tell
the
tale
he
began
to
recount
what
they
had
heard
so
carried
away
that
he
never
noticed
the
gathering
thundercloud
upon
his
brother
face
the
plains
the
mountains
the
shining
rivers
running
to
the
sea
he
seemed
to
conjure
up
all
of
them
as
he
told
the
story
but
face
never
changed
so
cut
in
the
elder
brother
at
last
when
the
younger
stopped
for
breath
it
is
for
a
fairy
tale
like
this
that
you
have
wasted
your
time
and
your
substance
have
emptied
my
money
box
you
bought
bees
with
it
to
buy
bees
when
the
forest
is
full
of
them
and
you
can
have
a
swarm
from
any
neighbor
for
the
asking
you
spend
money
that
some
lying
rascal
may
be
helped
upon
his
way
it
was
our
money
felix
reminded
him
gently
beginning
to
be
awakened
from
his
dream
by
the
bitter
anger
of
the
other
tone
mine
repeated
ralph
a
cold
fury
seemed
to
possess
him
which
discussions
over
money
could
alone
bring
forth
have
you
forgotten
that
everything
here
is
mine
given
me
by
our
father
the
bread
you
eat
the
roof
over
your
head
they
belong
to
me
do
you
understand
barbara
saw
in
the
firelight
that
felix
face
flushed
then
turned
white
no
one
but
herself
could
know
just
how
such
words
would
hurt
him
how
his
pride
his
love
for
his
brother
and
his
sturdy
independence
were
all
cut
to
the
very
quick
he
went
out
of
the
room
without
a
word
and
could
be
heard
climbing
the
ladderlike
stairs
that
led
to
the
room
he
had
made
for
himself
under
the
eaves
ralph
sat
down
by
the
fire
muttering
uneasily
something
about
it
all
blowing
over
with
lagging
steps
barbara
went
on
setting
the
table
they
were
not
prepared
to
see
felix
come
down
the
stairs
a
few
minutes
later
with
his
coat
and
cap
and
with
his
violin
under
his
arm
i
will
take
no
man
charity
not
even
my
brother
he
said
huskily
as
he
stood
still
for
a
moment
on
the
threshold
then
he
was
gone
barbara
leaned
over
the
half
door
and
watched
him
go
down
the
path
saw
him
pass
through
the
lane
of
tiny
apple
trees
saw
the
dusk
gather
about
him
as
he
went
on
a
smaller
and
smaller
plodding
figure
that
disappeared
at
last
into
the
dark
the
autumn
wind
in
the
oak
tree
sounded
blustering
and
cold
as
she
closed
the
door
and
turned
back
to
the
room
again
he
has
only
gone
down
to
the
town
he
will
come
back
growled
ralph
but
barbara
knew
better
he
has
gone
to
look
for
gold
she
cried
and
sitting
down
on
the
bench
by
the
fire
she
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
burst
into
tears
felix
used
to
think
as
the
days
and
weeks
passed
and
as
that
strange
journey
upon
which
he
had
launched
so
suddenly
dragged
on
and
on
that
the
grassy
slope
above
the
orchard
and
the
cool
dark
foliage
of
the
oak
tree
must
be
the
very
greenest
and
fairest
things
on
earth
there
was
no
green
now
before
his
aching
eyes
only
the
wide
stretch
of
prairie
a
rough
trail
deep
in
dust
winding
across
it
a
line
of
wagons
crawling
like
ants
over
the
vast
plain
and
a
blue
arch
of
sky
above
with
the
heat
it
was
october
when
he
went
away
from
home
it
was
a
month
later
when
by
leisurely
stage
and
slow
canal
boat
he
arrived
at
the
mississippi
river
the
outpost
of
established
travel
here
he
was
obliged
to
wait
until
spring
for
even
in
the
rush
of
there
were
few
bold
enough
to
attempt
the
overland
trail
in
winter
he
turned
his
hand
to
every
sort
of
work
he
did
odd
jobs
during
the
day
and
played
his
violin
for
dancing
at
night
he
grew
lean
and
and
graver
than
he
used
to
be
he
slept
in
strange
places
and
ate
stranger
food
he
suffered
pangs
of
hunger
and
of
homesickness
but
he
never
thought
of
going
back
his
violin
went
everywhere
with
him
and
in
more
than
one
of
the
little
towns
along
the
big
river
people
began
to
demand
the
boy
fiddler
who
could
make
such
gay
music
for
their
merrymakings
when
at
last
the
snow
melted
the
wild
geese
flew
northward
and
the
wilderness
trail
was
open
again
he
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
an
emigrant
party
to
which
to
attach
himself
abner
blythe
was
a
lean
hard
yankee
but
he
had
lived
for
years
in
the
middle
west
and
had
made
journeys
out
into
the
prairie
although
he
had
never
gone
the
whole
of
the
way
to
the
mountains
and
the
coast
he
knew
how
to
drive
cattle
with
the
long
whip
whose
snapping
lash
alone
can
voice
the
master
orders
and
which
can
flick
the
ear
or
flank
of
a
wandering
steer
at
the
outermost
limit
of
reach
his
frail
little
wife
was
to
go
with
them
their
boy
of
five
and
a
company
of
helpers
who
were
to
drive
the
wagons
of
supplies
and
to
serve
for
protection
against
indians
the
road
was
crowded
at
first
and
the
prairie
grass
grew
green
and
high
full
of
wild
strawberries
pink
wild
roses
and
meadow
larks
but
as
they
journeyed
slowly
westward
as
spring
passed
into
summer
the
green
turned
to
brown
under
the
burning
sun
the
low
bluffs
and
were
left
behind
and
they
came
to
the
wide
hot
plains
that
seemed
to
have
no
end
at
the
beginning
they
sometimes
passed
farmhouses
to
the
right
and
left
of
the
trail
built
by
some
struggling
pioneer
where
there
was
a
little
stream
of
water
and
where
a
few
trees
were
planted
the
places
looked
to
felix
like
the
noah
ark
he
used
to
play
with
when
he
was
small
the
tiny
toy
trees
the
square
toy
house
little
toy
animals
set
out
on
the
bare
brown
floor
of
the
prairie
even
the
gaunt
women
in
shapeless
garments
who
always
came
to
the
door
to
watch
the
wagon
train
go
by
were
not
unlike
the
stiff
wooden
figures
of
noah
at
last
however
even
the
scattered
houses
came
to
an
end
and
there
was
nothing
before
them
but
the
wilderness
it
was
desperately
hot
with
the
blazing
sun
above
and
the
scorching
winds
swooping
over
the
prairie
to
blow
in
their
faces
like
the
blast
of
a
furnace
they
made
long
stops
at
noontime
resting
in
the
shade
of
the
wagons
and
pressed
on
late
into
the
night
so
that
not
an
hour
might
be
lost
they
went
by
herds
of
buffalo
big
clumsy
inert
creatures
that
looked
so
formidable
from
in
front
and
so
insignificant
from
behind
they
saw
slim
swift
little
antelope
and
on
the
far
horizon
they
sometimes
made
out
moving
dots
that
must
be
indians
their
numbers
and
their
vigilance
however
seemed
great
enough
to
keep
them
safe
from
attack
a
deadly
weariness
began
to
fall
upon
them
all
so
that
abner
blythe
became
morose
and
silent
his
wife
looked
haggard
and
the
men
grew
irritable
and
the
animals
lagged
more
and
more
others
who
had
passed
that
way
had
left
many
of
their
footsore
beasts
behind
them
horses
oxen
cows
and
sheep
to
fall
a
prey
at
once
to
the
great
gray
prairie
wolves
that
hung
behind
every
wagon
train
waiting
for
the
stragglers
who
could
not
keep
up
it
is
only
the
human
beings
who
have
the
courage
to
go
on
abner
blythe
said
to
felix
you
would
think
that
horses
were
stronger
than
men
and
oxen
the
strongest
of
all
but
the
beasts
give
up
and
lie
down
by
the
road
to
die
yet
the
men
keep
on
it
is
not
strength
but
spirit
that
carries
us
all
to
our
journey
end
there
was
one
black
mare
the
dearly
beloved
of
heart
who
whether
dragging
at
the
heavy
wagon
or
cantering
under
the
saddle
was
always
full
of
energy
and
fire
she
was
the
boy
especial
charge
and
as
the
weeks
passed
the
two
became
such
friends
as
are
only
produced
by
long
companionship
and
unbelievable
hardships
endured
together
it
was
a
dreadful
hour
when
one
night
as
they
were
making
camp
the
little
mare
lay
down
and
not
even
for
a
feed
of
oats
or
the
precious
lump
of
sugar
offered
her
would
she
get
up
again
the
very
spirit
that
had
driven
her
forward
more
bravely
than
the
rest
had
produced
greater
exhaustion
now
we
will
have
to
go
on
without
her
said
abner
blythe
dejectedly
as
they
sat
about
the
camp
fire
felix
was
feeding
the
flame
with
the
sparse
fuel
and
anna
blythe
abner
wife
was
sitting
on
a
roll
of
blankets
with
her
child
on
her
lap
the
little
boy
was
ill
and
lay
wailing
against
her
shoulder
do
leave
the
mare
felix
begged
a
day
or
two
of
rest
will
cure
her
entirely
there
is
water
here
and
grass
beside
the
stream
we
could
camp
two
or
three
days
until
she
can
go
on
abner
shook
his
head
wearily
we
have
no
time
to
waste
he
declared
it
is
august
now
and
we
must
cross
the
mountains
before
the
middle
of
september
we
have
a
day
not
even
an
hour
to
lose
anna
blythe
sighed
a
deep
quivering
sigh
felix
knew
that
she
loved
the
little
horse
too
and
so
he
sometimes
thought
she
was
herself
so
weary
that
she
often
longed
to
lie
down
beside
the
trail
and
perish
as
the
tired
dumb
animals
did
she
had
never
made
complaint
before
but
perhaps
appalled
by
the
thought
of
the
mountains
still
to
be
crossed
she
burst
out
into
fierce
questioning
abner
why
do
we
turn
back
what
is
it
all
for
can
gold
all
the
gold
we
could
ever
gather
repay
us
for
this
terrible
journey
we
are
little
more
than
halfway
and
the
worst
is
still
before
us
we
could
go
back
while
there
is
still
time
why
do
we
go
on
abner
spreading
his
big
hands
upon
his
knees
sat
staring
into
the
fire
i
do
know
he
said
at
last
i
vow
i
do
know
it
is
not
the
excitement
nor
the
gold
that
drives
us
there
is
no
telling
what
it
may
be
our
country
must
go
on
she
must
press
forward
to
new
opportunities
she
must
dwell
in
new
places
it
is
through
people
like
us
that
such
growth
comes
about
we
do
ourselves
know
why
a
little
ambition
a
little
hope
a
great
blind
impulse
and
we
go
forward
that
is
all
they
sat
very
still
while
the
fire
died
out
into
charring
embers
and
darkness
filled
the
wide
sky
above
them
showing
the
whole
circling
march
of
the
stars
like
a
sky
at
sea
we
must
be
moving
abner
said
at
last
we
can
make
a
few
miles
more
before
it
is
time
to
sleep
they
all
arose
wearily
and
made
ready
to
go
on
felix
went
to
where
the
black
mare
lay
and
passed
his
hand
down
her
smooth
neck
she
whinnied
and
thrust
her
soft
nose
against
his
cheek
but
would
make
no
effort
to
move
he
stood
for
a
moment
thinking
deeply
very
clearly
did
he
understand
abner
unreasoning
desire
to
go
forward
but
perhaps
because
he
was
only
a
boy
he
did
not
feel
that
same
wish
so
completely
and
passionately
there
were
other
ideas
in
his
mind
and
uppermost
among
them
was
the
feeling
that
one
can
not
desert
a
friend
just
as
the
foremost
wagon
creaked
into
motion
and
rumbled
forward
into
the
dark
his
resolution
found
its
way
into
words
i
think
i
will
stay
with
the
mare
he
said
in
three
days
at
least
she
will
be
rested
enough
to
go
on
and
then
i
can
easily
overtake
you
we
do
want
to
lose
her
he
tried
to
hide
the
depth
of
his
feeling
with
commonplace
words
it
would
be
sensible
when
we
have
so
few
horses
abner
did
not
consent
willingly
but
he
agreed
at
last
she
travel
fast
when
she
is
on
her
feet
again
he
said
and
i
do
like
leaving
her
myself
felix
took
some
provisions
from
the
cook
wagon
gathered
up
his
blankets
slung
his
gun
over
his
shoulder
and
as
a
last
thought
reached
in
for
his
violin
it
would
be
good
company
in
the
dark
he
thought
keep
your
gun
cocked
for
indians
were
abner
last
instructions
look
out
for
rattlesnakes
at
the
water
holes
and
catch
us
up
when
you
can
good
luck
to
you
the
boy
stood
beside
the
trail
and
listened
to
the
slow
complaining
of
the
wheels
and
the
shuffling
of
the
feet
of
horses
and
oxen
in
the
dust
as
the
whole
train
moved
onward
for
a
little
while
he
could
hear
them
and
could
see
the
bulk
of
the
wagon
tops
outlined
against
the
stars
then
the
long
roll
of
the
prairie
hid
them
and
he
was
left
all
alone
in
the
wide
wild
empty
plain
chapter
ix
the
fiddler
of
apple
tree
lane
felix
tended
the
little
horse
as
best
he
could
bringing
her
grass
which
she
would
not
eat
and
water
which
she
drank
gratefully
at
last
unbelievably
tired
he
built
up
the
fire
and
lay
down
to
sleep
his
heavy
eyes
were
just
closing
when
he
saw
a
black
shadow
move
silently
across
the
basin
of
the
little
watercourse
and
heard
the
crunch
of
a
pebble
dislodged
by
a
softly
padding
foot
as
he
sat
up
a
big
gray
wolf
as
unafraid
as
a
dog
from
long
following
at
the
heels
of
the
emigrant
trains
came
out
into
the
circle
of
light
with
its
head
lowered
and
its
eyes
shining
in
the
dark
it
sat
down
to
wait
the
fire
dwindled
for
there
was
little
to
burn
save
the
dried
twigs
from
the
bushes
that
lined
the
stream
nor
did
felix
dare
to
leave
the
horse
long
enough
to
gather
a
fresh
supply
more
gray
figures
came
through
the
dark
to
gather
in
a
wide
waiting
circle
all
about
the
fire
within
the
limits
of
their
brutish
minds
lay
the
knowledge
that
fires
would
die
down
that
strength
of
man
and
beast
would
fail
and
that
once
a
straggler
could
not
go
on
patient
waiting
always
made
him
their
prey
at
last
felix
cocked
his
gun
took
long
aim
at
a
pair
of
green
eyes
glittering
in
the
dark
but
in
the
end
lowered
the
muzzle
without
firing
the
flash
of
a
rifle
and
its
report
carried
far
over
the
level
prairie
and
there
were
other
eyes
that
might
be
watching
for
human
stragglers
fiercer
and
hungrier
eyes
even
than
were
the
wolves
as
the
foremost
animal
drew
a
little
closer
he
took
up
his
violin
and
began
to
play
he
had
a
strange
audience
the
greedy
beasts
that
slunk
away
at
the
first
strains
of
the
unwonted
sound
stole
back
yet
moved
uneasily
away
again
the
little
fat
inquisitive
prairie
dogs
that
popped
out
of
their
burrows
and
sat
up
to
listen
the
circling
nighthawks
that
wheeled
and
called
overhead
hour
after
hour
he
played
but
whenever
he
paused
the
hungry
circle
drew
in
about
him
and
he
was
forced
to
raise
his
aching
arm
and
ply
his
bow
again
the
first
hint
of
dawn
was
brightening
the
sky
when
the
creatures
of
the
night
began
to
slip
away
and
felix
laying
down
his
violin
suddenly
laughed
aloud
i
wish
that
granny
fullerton
who
thought
that
it
was
quite
safe
for
us
to
live
on
the
windy
hill
he
said
i
wish
that
she
could
see
me
now
then
he
lay
down
pillowed
his
head
upon
his
arm
and
fell
so
fast
asleep
that
as
he
said
afterward
a
whole
tribe
of
indians
could
have
ridden
over
him
and
he
would
never
have
moved
it
was
indeed
horse
feet
that
aroused
him
but
not
by
good
fortune
the
unshod
hoofs
of
indian
ponies
a
band
of
men
was
riding
toward
him
from
the
westward
hard
grizzled
men
and
beyond
anything
felix
had
ever
seen
we
met
your
party
back
yonder
said
their
leader
they
asked
us
to
look
out
for
you
as
we
went
by
glad
to
see
the
indians
have
got
you
yet
oh
exclaimed
felix
sitting
up
and
rubbing
his
eyes
have
you
have
you
been
in
california
the
man
nodded
he
drew
out
of
his
pocket
a
greasy
little
buckskin
bag
opened
the
strings
and
poured
a
stream
of
something
yellow
into
the
boy
hand
ever
see
gold
dust
before
he
asked
it
was
felix
first
sight
of
the
odd
flattened
flakes
of
metal
that
shine
dully
in
your
hand
that
are
no
two
alike
so
that
you
can
turn
them
over
and
over
always
seeing
different
shapes
and
sizes
different
gleams
and
lights
upon
their
changing
surfaces
there
a
lot
of
it
back
there
where
we
been
the
man
said
grinning
slowly
as
he
saw
felix
excited
face
we
left
it
there
for
you
and
those
like
you
and
did
you
find
all
you
wanted
are
you
going
home
now
to
be
rich
and
comfortable
all
your
days
the
boy
inquired
the
man
grin
grew
broader
still
you
do
know
gold
miners
sonny
he
said
we
been
at
work
on
the
american
river
diggings
where
your
folks
ahead
there
are
going
and
we
found
it
good
enough
but
we
heard
of
something
better
over
to
the
southward
of
that
valley
there
another
one
deeper
wilder
hard
to
get
into
but
with
the
richest
pay
dirt
you
ever
dreamed
of
we
staked
out
our
claims
and
left
one
man
to
hold
it
while
we
go
back
to
the
states
for
supplies
and
better
equipment
the
gold
harder
to
get
out
but
it
there
all
right
it
makes
american
river
look
like
nothing
at
all
he
turned
in
the
saddle
and
looked
up
the
little
stream
bed
where
the
water
lay
in
shallow
pools
below
the
overhanging
bushes
the
black
mare
had
at
last
struggled
to
her
feet
and
was
now
grazing
on
the
sparse
grass
that
bordered
the
river
it
is
none
too
safe
for
you
to
be
here
alone
young
fellow
the
man
observed
there
a
band
of
indians
have
been
doing
considerable
mischief
around
this
neighborhood
just
lately
we
been
hearing
of
them
from
every
party
as
we
came
along
i
not
afraid
returned
felix
stoutly
one
boy
and
one
horse
would
be
hard
to
find
in
this
great
wide
prairie
are
you
afraid
you
will
meet
the
indians
yourselves
afraid
the
other
laughed
aloud
why
we
looking
for
them
and
it
will
be
a
sorry
day
for
them
when
we
find
them
he
sobered
and
went
on
earnestly
the
woman
in
that
party
you
left
called
out
a
message
for
you
as
we
came
by
him
she
said
to
us
the
horse
is
his
and
that
he
is
to
go
back
with
you
to
the
states
tell
him
god
bless
him
she
said
we
be
glad
enough
to
have
you
if
you
care
to
come
with
us
he
concluded
felix
looked
at
the
long
empty
trail
before
him
he
looked
up
at
the
prospector
hard
brown
face
and
then
at
the
little
heap
of
gold
dust
in
his
hand
i
not
go
back
just
yet
he
said
there
are
things
i
must
see
first
they
rode
jingling
away
the
sun
glinting
on
their
gun
barrels
and
pistol
butts
until
they
disappeared
in
the
shimmering
hot
distance
of
the
dusty
trail
felix
as
the
heat
of
the
day
increased
led
the
mare
up
the
watercourse
to
where
the
bushes
were
tall
enough
to
afford
a
little
shade
he
himself
crawled
under
a
rock
beside
one
of
the
pools
and
lay
there
very
quietly
waiting
for
the
long
sleepy
day
to
pass
it
was
noontime
with
the
world
so
still
that
he
could
actually
hear
the
water
of
the
stream
filtering
through
the
sand
as
it
ran
sluggishly
from
pool
to
pool
when
a
new
sound
caught
his
attention
there
was
a
shuffling
of
muffled
feet
a
stone
dislodged
from
the
bank
above
the
click
of
metal
against
metal
but
every
noise
so
stealthy
and
quiet
that
he
could
hardly
believe
he
heard
he
did
not
dare
to
move
but
peered
through
the
branches
of
the
bush
beside
him
and
saw
a
strange
cavalcade
passing
on
the
high
bank
above
little
brown
and
buckskin
and
piebald
indian
ponies
their
unshod
hoofs
stepping
lightly
and
quietly
over
the
dry
grass
each
with
a
painted
rider
armed
and
decorated
with
all
of
an
indian
trappings
of
war
the
feathered
war
bonnets
that
crowned
their
heads
and
reached
to
their
heels
were
of
every
gay
color
their
fierce
faces
were
daubed
with
red
and
ocher
they
carried
some
of
them
guns
more
of
them
rude
lances
and
bows
and
arrows
felix
was
so
near
that
he
could
make
out
the
strings
of
beads
and
claws
of
wild
animals
about
their
necks
could
see
their
red
skins
glisten
and
could
watch
the
muscles
of
their
slim
thighs
move
and
ripple
as
they
guided
their
wise
little
horses
more
by
pressure
of
the
knee
than
by
use
of
the
rude
indian
bridles
not
one
of
them
spoke
once
a
pony
snorted
in
the
dust
but
that
was
the
only
sound
as
they
moved
past
him
and
turned
into
the
trail
with
their
faces
eastward
the
whole
procession
might
have
been
a
vision
a
mirage
of
the
high
hot
noontide
and
of
the
boy
tired
brain
but
after
the
men
were
gone
and
he
had
crawled
out
from
his
hiding
place
he
could
see
the
footprints
in
the
dust
and
could
assure
himself
that
they
were
real
after
a
long
time
he
heard
shots
very
faint
and
far
away
lasting
for
an
hour
or
more
before
the
hush
of
the
prairie
fell
again
the
cool
night
came
at
last
and
the
little
mare
visibly
strengthened
by
the
rest
and
grazing
came
trotting
to
him
splashing
happily
through
the
water
of
the
pool
those
gray
enemies
of
the
night
before
did
not
come
near
nor
though
he
waited
two
days
watchful
and
alert
did
any
of
the
indians
return
he
thought
of
that
band
of
men
he
had
talked
with
hard
seasoned
and
well
armed
for
the
struggle
from
the
very
first
he
had
felt
little
doubt
as
to
what
the
issue
of
such
a
battle
would
be
it
seems
too
long
to
tell
of
how
felix
mounted
the
mare
at
last
and
cantered
away
along
the
trail
rejoicing
in
swift
motion
again
after
the
long
wait
and
the
crawling
pace
of
the
ox
team
nor
can
it
be
fully
told
how
he
and
his
friends
toiled
forward
across
the
plain
over
that
dreaded
stretch
of
desert
that
came
at
the
far
edge
of
it
up
the
mountains
until
that
wondrous
minute
when
the
endless
bleak
slopes
suddenly
fell
away
before
them
and
they
looked
down
into
the
wide
green
wonder
of
a
new
land
in
less
than
a
week
from
that
day
felix
long
dream
had
come
true
he
was
standing
in
a
rushing
stream
with
a
miner
pan
in
his
excited
hands
he
saw
the
gravel
wash
away
the
muddy
earth
dissolve
the
black
sand
settle
to
the
bottom
to
be
dried
and
blown
away
leaving
it
did
not
even
then
seem
believable
the
sparkling
grains
of
yellow
gold
they
did
well
he
and
abner
blythe
though
their
backs
ached
at
the
end
of
the
day
and
they
came
home
to
sleep
worn
out
wet
and
dirty
their
buckskin
bags
filled
slowly
with
gold
dust
as
the
autumn
passed
yet
felix
could
not
put
from
his
mind
the
talk
of
the
man
he
had
met
on
the
prairie
the
tale
of
higher
mountains
deeper
valleys
and
richer
diggings
over
to
the
southward
when
the
rains
came
and
there
was
little
work
to
do
he
thought
of
those
words
more
and
more
and
when
the
open
weather
came
once
more
he
gathered
supplies
said
one
day
to
abner
and
anna
and
set
forth
to
seek
a
further
greater
fortune
for
them
all
it
was
a
toilsome
journey
over
the
mountains
for
very
few
had
as
yet
passed
that
way
the
deep
shadowy
cañons
the
rushing
streams
the
smooth
faces
of
granite
walls
seemed
impassable
barriers
but
felix
at
last
passed
them
all
and
came
into
the
wild
rugged
valley
of
bear
creek
he
staked
his
claim
put
up
his
little
tent
and
went
down
to
the
river
to
wash
his
first
pan
of
gold
yes
the
prospector
had
been
right
here
in
this
bleak
far
region
the
toil
was
much
heavier
but
the
reward
was
unbelievably
great
there
were
not
yet
many
miners
who
had
come
so
far
but
the
one
whose
claim
was
next
to
felix
and
whose
rough
shanty
stood
almost
side
by
side
with
his
tent
had
been
there
among
the
first
he
was
a
friend
of
those
men
from
whom
the
boy
had
first
heard
of
the
place
and
he
willingly
showed
the
newcomer
the
best
slope
for
his
claim
and
the
easiest
way
to
wash
the
gold
there
room
for
all
so
far
he
said
the
others
below
there
on
american
river
have
had
time
to
get
discontented
yet
but
there
will
be
a
rush
up
here
soon
when
the
place
begins
to
be
crowded
there
will
be
jumping
of
claims
and
robbery
and
fights
with
knives
out
and
blood
shed
just
as
you
have
seen
it
down
there
but
we
will
be
peaceable
and
friendly
here
as
long
as
we
can
the
old
miner
seemed
to
take
a
great
fancy
to
felix
and
helped
him
with
advice
and
kindness
in
unnumbered
ways
he
had
built
himself
a
little
hut
of
pine
logs
roofed
with
bark
as
a
better
protection
than
a
tent
against
the
mountain
storms
felix
sat
there
with
him
one
night
before
the
rude
stone
hearth
while
the
rain
fell
in
deluges
outside
and
the
wind
went
calling
and
blustering
down
the
valley
the
miner
piled
the
fuel
high
upon
the
fire
and
as
the
hours
passed
told
story
after
story
of
wild
adventure
of
desperate
escape
of
bold
crime
and
of
the
quick
merciless
justice
of
the
frontier
at
last
his
fund
of
narrative
seemed
to
come
to
an
end
and
he
was
silent
for
a
little
yes
these
are
rich
diggings
he
said
finally
going
back
to
the
subject
of
which
they
had
first
been
talking
but
there
is
more
gold
even
than
this
somewhere
beyond
a
man
i
knew
once
a
prospector
told
me
a
strange
story
he
was
captured
by
the
indians
and
carried
off
to
the
south
over
beyond
the
mountains
to
the
edge
of
the
desert
he
escaped
from
them
but
he
got
lost
trying
to
go
back
and
wandered
for
days
nearly
dying
with
thirst
torn
and
cut
by
the
cactus
thorns
blind
and
nearly
crazed
by
the
terrible
heat
he
came
to
the
foot
of
a
hill
that
he
was
too
weak
to
climb
and
he
lay
down
there
to
die
but
a
rain
fell
and
he
lay
soaking
in
it
all
night
drinking
what
gathered
in
a
rock
pool
beside
him
with
rattlesnakes
and
lizards
he
said
crawling
up
to
drink
with
him
and
he
never
cared
in
the
morning
his
head
was
clear
and
he
looked
up
the
hill
to
see
the
outcropping
of
such
a
gold
mine
as
you
never
dreamed
of
lying
there
on
the
open
slope
was
the
quartz
in
plain
sight
to
be
picked
up
with
your
bare
hands
he
took
some
with
him
but
not
much
for
gold
is
heavy
when
you
are
staggering
weak
and
he
went
on
and
on
lost
again
and
nearly
dead
but
at
last
he
came
to
a
settlement
he
lay
in
a
mexican
house
raving
with
fever
for
weeks
but
in
the
end
he
got
well
but
when
he
tried
to
go
back
to
his
mine
he
could
never
find
the
way
felix
was
listening
eagerly
but
he
did
not
interrupt
or
even
ask
a
question
when
the
man
paused
the
deep
voice
rasped
huskily
for
evidently
the
miner
was
telling
his
tale
with
an
intent
purpose
i
have
always
meant
some
day
to
go
and
look
for
that
mine
myself
when
i
found
a
comrade
i
could
trust
one
who
would
not
be
afraid
of
the
hardship
and
the
danger
the
way
there
is
a
terrible
journey
but
i
believe
i
know
almost
to
a
certainty
where
the
place
must
be
will
you
come
boy
will
you
come
felix
got
up
and
went
to
the
tiny
square
window
to
look
out
his
voice
was
thick
with
excitement
but
he
did
not
answer
directly
the
storm
has
passed
he
said
and
i
must
go
back
to
my
tent
i
i
will
think
about
what
you
say
and
tell
you
in
the
morning
he
went
out
into
the
dark
wet
night
closing
the
door
with
a
hand
that
shook
and
fumbled
against
the
wooden
latch
the
old
miner
must
have
slept
little
for
it
was
scarcely
dawn
before
he
had
crossed
the
muddy
slope
to
felix
tent
early
as
he
was
the
boy
was
before
him
gathering
up
his
possessions
and
thrusting
them
into
his
pack
you
going
cried
the
man
joyfully
but
felix
shook
his
head
i
going
back
he
said
and
beyond
that
he
would
tell
him
nothing
he
could
not
explain
how
in
the
watches
of
the
night
there
had
come
to
him
the
realization
that
the
fever
for
finding
gold
is
more
consuming
than
the
fever
for
getting
it
that
there
is
always
the
thirst
to
go
on
to
leave
what
one
has
and
seek
some
new
dazzling
discovery
that
seems
just
out
of
reach
to
follow
adventure
is
one
thing
but
as
the
years
pass
to
surrender
a
whole
life
to
a
single
and
selfish
desire
is
quite
another
some
indwelling
wisdom
had
told
felix
that
it
was
time
to
turn
back
but
he
had
no
words
by
which
to
make
the
other
understand
the
old
miner
had
given
up
to
the
dream
long
ago
he
would
always
be
seeking
something
richer
and
better
always
leaving
it
for
some
golden
vision
that
would
lure
him
forward
until
at
last
he
would
disappear
in
the
mountains
or
the
desert
and
never
return
i
am
going
to
turn
over
my
claim
here
to
abner
blythe
declared
felix
it
will
make
him
rich
and
his
wife
happy
and
you
had
better
stay
to
work
it
with
him
for
i
am
going
home
i
ca
stay
the
miner
seemed
to
understand
also
but
he
was
as
brief
and
inarticulate
as
was
the
boy
i
one
of
those
that
has
to
go
on
and
on
he
turned
away
and
walked
back
to
his
cabin
through
the
flowers
and
the
dripping
green
bushes
who
may
know
what
pictures
either
of
dark
regret
or
of
golden
hope
were
passing
before
his
eyes
as
vividly
as
were
felix
memories
of
the
low
cottage
on
the
hill
of
the
apple
trees
that
would
be
in
bloom
now
all
up
and
down
medford
valley
of
the
wind
talking
in
the
oak
tree
outside
his
window
a
quarrel
with
one
only
brother
looks
suddenly
very
small
when
so
many
thousand
miles
are
stretched
out
between
ralph
had
often
said
that
the
hollyhocks
were
growing
too
many
and
should
be
uprooted
but
barbara
begging
for
their
lives
somehow
always
saved
them
in
the
end
they
had
spread
out
from
the
door
and
advanced
down
the
hill
in
marching
regiments
a
glowing
mass
of
color
the
singing
bees
were
busy
all
day
in
the
cups
of
scarlet
fading
to
pink
and
white
and
white
shading
into
yellow
the
afternoon
sun
was
behind
them
lighting
them
to
unwonted
glory
when
felix
came
plodding
along
the
lane
on
each
side
of
which
the
apple
trees
were
beginning
to
grow
tall
barbara
was
in
the
garden
cutting
sweet
peas
into
her
apron
and
ralph
beside
her
was
standing
in
silence
watching
the
bees
a
dozen
times
the
girl
had
read
that
same
thought
in
his
mind
that
he
would
give
ten
years
of
life
to
unsay
the
words
that
had
driven
his
brother
away
and
that
had
taught
himself
such
a
bitter
lesson
then
suddenly
barbara
uttered
such
a
cry
of
joy
that
even
the
bees
hummed
and
hovered
lower
and
slow
old
chloe
came
hurrying
to
the
door
the
old
woman
smiled
with
tears
running
down
her
wrinkled
face
as
she
saw
who
it
was
that
came
trudging
up
the
hill
there
good
luck
come
back
to
this
house
at
last
she
said
aloud
an
hour
later
when
felix
as
the
twilight
was
falling
sat
down
upon
the
doorstep
and
began
to
play
his
violin
he
never
grew
tired
of
telling
the
tale
of
his
adventurous
journey
nor
did
his
sister
and
brother
ever
grow
tired
of
listening
ralph
brighton
had
lost
in
that
one
dreadful
hour
his
love
for
dollar
signs
and
he
nodded
in
wise
agreement
over
felix
decision
to
give
up
the
quest
for
gold
barbara
would
hearken
in
awed
fascination
to
that
story
of
the
man
lost
in
the
desert
whose
eyes
looked
once
upon
fabulous
wealth
but
who
could
never
find
it
again
wherever
gold
mines
are
there
is
to
be
found
such
a
legend
a
tale
of
greater
riches
just
beyond
men
knowledge
no
matter
how
dazzling
is
the
wealth
at
hand
there
is
always
that
tantalizing
story
of
the
lost
mine
sometimes
reputed
to
be
far
and
inaccessible
sometimes
only
just
over
the
next
hill
yet
always
as
difficult
to
discover
as
the
end
of
the
rainbow
but
as
abner
blythe
said
it
is
so
a
country
grows
and
when
men
cease
from
following
rainbows
then
will
the
world
stand
still
chapter
x
a
man
of
straw
the
shower
had
lifted
and
was
moving
away
down
the
valley
a
gray
mist
of
rain
with
a
slowly
following
flood
of
sunshine
oliver
got
up
and
said
without
enthusiasm
we
must
go
now
we
have
an
errand
we
must
do
come
along
janet
she
rose
to
go
with
him
but
looked
back
wistfully
several
times
as
she
went
with
lagging
feet
down
the
hill
she
had
wished
that
the
story
might
last
forever
so
that
she
need
not
face
anthony
crawford
at
the
end
of
it
they
said
nothing
to
each
other
as
they
climbed
into
the
car
and
threaded
the
twisting
lanes
and
byroads
that
would
take
them
to
the
house
they
sought
oliver
was
rehearsing
within
himself
what
he
should
say
when
they
presented
the
picture
my
sister
carried
this
away
by
mistake
we
thought
that
we
should
return
it
to
you
as
soon
as
possible
and
then
he
will
say
something
sharp
and
unkind
and
i
wo
know
what
to
answer
he
reflected
drearily
i
will
want
to
say
that
i
am
sure
it
is
his
anyway
and
that
janet
did
well
to
take
it
even
by
accident
but
what
is
the
use
of
stirring
up
more
trouble
well
i
can
only
explain
and
then
get
away
as
quickly
as
we
can
it
is
probable
that
janet
who
sat
by
him
in
silence
was
really
suffering
less
than
he
oliver
had
undertaken
the
responsibility
of
returning
the
picture
and
oliver
was
a
dependable
boy
who
could
manage
it
far
better
than
she
could
she
thought
little
of
what
was
to
be
said
or
done
and
was
only
anxious
to
have
the
affair
over
they
left
the
car
in
the
lane
and
walked
together
toward
the
sagging
gate
a
man
was
just
coming
through
it
who
proved
as
they
came
near
to
be
john
massey
his
friendly
face
was
pale
under
its
sunburn
and
drawn
into
unfamiliar
lines
of
anger
and
despair
peyton
sent
me
the
money
to
settle
up
my
rent
he
told
them
and
i
came
up
here
to
pay
it
and
arrange
about
leaving
crawford
wants
me
to
stay
until
the
first
of
the
month
but
i
am
going
he
has
never
stocked
the
farm
with
the
tools
and
machinery
a
landlord
is
supposed
to
furnish
so
i
bought
them
myself
what
i
could
and
now
he
says
they
are
his
he
wants
to
know
how
i
can
prove
that
i
paid
for
them
when
every
one
knows
that
it
was
his
place
to
do
it
he
laughed
at
me
when
i
said
it
would
ruin
me
entirely
he
said
one
gain
was
always
from
another
man
loss
i
vow
there
is
the
spirit
of
a
devil
in
him
he
looked
back
at
the
house
among
the
trees
clenching
his
big
hands
and
muttering
to
himself
in
helpless
fury
he
just
stood
there
grinning
even
guessing
my
thoughts
for
he
said
could
knock
me
down
i
know
but
it
would
be
no
satisfaction
to
you
for
i
would
get
back
at
you
through
the
law
it
would
cost
you
more
than
it
is
worth
john
massey
it
was
what
i
knew
was
true
myself
so
i
kept
my
hands
off
him
and
came
away
janet
and
oliver
stood
looking
at
him
miserably
knowing
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
get
into
the
car
and
wait
for
us
oliver
directed
at
last
we
will
take
you
home
when
we
have
finished
here
we
wo
stay
long
you
wo
want
to
observed
john
massey
bitterly
he
is
in
a
famous
bad
temper
they
went
through
the
gate
with
janet
steps
lagging
more
than
ever
there
was
something
almost
uncanny
about
a
man
who
could
cause
such
misery
to
other
people
and
yet
go
unscathed
himself
they
saw
him
almost
immediately
as
they
came
up
the
path
he
had
been
cutting
down
some
weeds
in
the
neglected
field
and
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
it
close
beside
the
scarecrow
he
did
not
move
but
waited
for
them
to
come
close
evidently
meditating
what
he
could
say
that
would
hurt
and
anger
them
the
most
he
began
to
speak
the
moment
they
came
near
giving
oliver
no
opening
for
what
he
had
meant
to
say
so
jasper
peyton
having
sent
one
of
you
to
steal
my
picture
has
lost
courage
and
sent
two
of
you
to
bring
it
back
again
very
clever
very
clever
of
him
indeed
he
knew
nothing
about
it
janet
was
beginning
passionately
when
oliver
silenced
her
by
a
touch
on
her
shoulder
he
knows
that
he
reminded
her
calmly
he
is
only
trying
to
make
you
angry
he
caught
a
look
of
smoldering
fury
in
anthony
crawford
eye
and
a
note
of
surprised
irritation
in
his
voice
well
the
man
snapped
am
i
to
have
my
property
or
not
you
are
to
have
it
we
will
not
keep
anything
that
you
even
claim
as
yours
returned
oliver
he
felt
hot
rage
surging
up
within
him
yet
he
strove
to
keep
it
down
he
had
realized
of
a
sudden
that
this
man
who
could
hurt
his
cousin
jasper
so
deeply
who
could
ruin
john
massey
could
harm
neither
him
nor
janet
in
the
least
oliver
had
felt
real
dread
as
he
came
through
the
gate
he
had
been
haunted
by
the
vague
terror
of
what
anthony
crawford
might
be
able
to
do
but
he
looked
upon
him
now
with
disillusioned
eyes
knowing
him
for
nothing
but
a
selfish
spiteful
man
whose
power
over
them
was
nothing
at
all
if
i
can
only
keep
as
calm
as
he
can
he
will
never
get
the
better
of
me
the
boy
thought
desperately
as
he
struggled
with
his
own
rising
tide
of
anger
perhaps
you
would
be
glad
to
have
me
establish
my
real
rights
said
crawford
you
would
like
to
have
it
brought
up
in
court
perhaps
how
your
sister
was
found
going
through
my
possessions
and
how
she
happened
quite
by
chance
of
course
to
select
the
most
portable
and
valuable
article
in
my
house
and
carry
it
away
with
her
she
would
like
i
am
sure
to
have
public
opportunity
to
make
all
that
quite
plain
oliver
heard
janet
gasp
of
horror
but
he
still
by
a
great
effort
retained
his
own
presence
of
mind
we
are
not
afraid
of
you
he
asserted
looking
straight
into
the
other
narrow
shifting
eyes
i
am
nearly
as
big
as
you
and
i
could
roll
you
over
and
over
in
the
mud
of
this
wet
field
only
that
would
give
you
the
legal
hold
on
me
that
is
just
what
you
wish
you
ca
do
us
any
real
harm
no
matter
what
you
pretend
i
do
believe
you
have
anything
behind
those
threats
you
make
to
cousin
jasper
i
do
think
you
believe
in
your
claims
yourself
you
a
bluff
like
this
scarecrow
here
you
nothing
but
a
bogy
man
stuffed
with
straw
he
caught
the
scarecrow
by
the
shoulder
venting
his
rage
upon
the
helpless
bundle
of
rags
shaking
it
even
out
of
its
ridiculous
resemblance
to
its
master
until
it
fell
to
bits
about
his
feet
he
flung
down
the
miniature
upon
the
heap
of
rags
and
followed
by
janet
walked
away
across
the
field
anthony
crawford
stood
looking
after
him
never
offering
a
word
when
oliver
reached
the
path
he
became
aware
that
john
massey
was
leaning
over
the
gate
grinning
in
delight
the
rain
was
beginning
to
fall
steadily
again
as
they
came
out
into
the
lane
and
climbed
into
the
car
it
rained
all
of
the
afternoon
but
ceased
at
nightfall
just
in
time
so
janet
said
to
keep
brown
from
nervous
prostration
oliver
could
not
quite
understand
how
plump
comfortable
brown
could
be
threatened
with
such
a
malady
for
he
had
forgotten
that
next
day
there
was
to
be
a
much
heralded
outing
for
all
the
members
of
cousin
jasper
household
the
occasion
was
a
celebration
at
the
next
village
a
glorified
edition
of
the
ordinary
country
fair
in
which
farmers
summer
visitors
and
the
residents
of
the
bigger
estates
were
all
accustomed
to
take
part
a
magnificent
affair
it
was
to
be
with
exhibitions
peanut
and
lemonade
stands
motor
races
a
horse
show
something
to
please
the
taste
of
every
variety
of
person
it
was
cousin
jasper
custom
to
give
the
whole
staff
of
servants
a
holiday
for
the
festival
although
the
cook
usually
waited
to
serve
an
early
lunch
and
brown
came
home
before
the
others
to
set
out
a
late
supper
no
influence
on
earth
could
ever
persuade
cousin
jasper
to
attend
one
of
these
merrymakings
but
every
other
person
under
his
roof
was
absorbed
in
looking
forward
to
the
great
day
of
the
summer
elaborate
preparations
had
been
made
and
all
that
was
now
in
question
was
the
weather
for
to
make
such
an
event
a
success
it
seemed
absolutely
necessary
to
have
one
of
those
clear
days
that
seem
specially
to
belong
to
circuses
fairs
and
midsummer
festivals
janet
was
to
go
under
the
safe
but
excited
wing
of
brown
and
oliver
also
was
looking
forward
to
the
day
with
some
anticipation
i
wonder
if
the
beeman
and
polly
will
be
there
he
thought
and
went
off
into
further
speculation
as
to
what
the
beeman
would
look
like
in
the
more
civilized
clothes
that
such
an
occasion
would
demand
i
might
not
even
know
him
he
reflected
when
the
day
came
however
cloudless
hot
just
what
such
a
day
should
be
oliver
suddenly
announced
that
he
was
not
going
i
do
like
to
leave
cousin
jasper
all
alone
when
he
is
so
worried
he
said
to
janet
but
could
not
explain
why
there
should
be
any
cause
for
misgiving
i
did
care
a
great
deal
about
going
anyway
he
refused
to
listen
to
her
suggestion
that
she
should
stay
also
lines
of
motors
were
rolling
down
the
road
from
early
morning
onward
filled
with
or
befrilled
holiday
makers
or
laden
with
farmers
and
farmers
wives
and
farmers
children
janet
and
brown
the
one
an
excited
flutter
of
white
organdie
skirts
the
other
a
ponderous
rustle
of
tight
brown
taffeta
departed
at
ten
and
by
one
the
great
house
was
empty
of
all
save
oliver
and
cousin
jasper
the
afternoon
seemed
very
still
and
very
long
as
one
hour
followed
another
oliver
strolled
out
to
the
gate
and
stood
looking
down
the
road
but
the
procession
of
motors
had
long
since
come
to
an
end
so
that
the
highway
stretched
white
and
empty
to
the
far
end
of
the
valley
yet
as
he
stood
idly
staring
out
in
the
hot
quiet
he
thought
that
he
saw
a
small
dilapidated
vehicle
come
round
a
distant
turn
and
advance
slowly
toward
him
when
it
was
near
enough
for
him
to
recognize
the
old
white
horse
the
driver
pulled
up
suddenly
turned
the
cart
sharply
about
in
the
road
and
rattled
away
in
the
direction
from
which
he
had
come
could
it
be
that
he
had
seen
the
boy
there
in
the
open
gate
and
therefore
had
decided
not
to
come
in
oliver
could
scarcely
believe
that
this
was
the
reason
an
hour
later
when
he
had
gone
back
to
the
house
he
saw
a
ragged
barefoot
youth
in
faded
overalls
come
shuffling
up
the
drive
he
delivered
to
oliver
a
letter
addressed
to
cousin
jasper
and
said
it
was
from
crawford
and
he
was
to
be
sure
to
get
an
answer
oliver
carried
it
away
to
the
study
and
stood
waiting
looking
out
through
the
window
while
cousin
jasper
should
read
it
and
write
a
reply
the
brightness
of
the
holiday
weather
seemed
to
be
growing
dim
somehow
the
sun
was
still
shining
but
with
a
touch
of
greenish
unreal
light
i
hope
there
is
going
to
be
a
storm
he
thought
his
reflections
were
interrupted
by
a
sound
in
the
room
behind
him
cousin
jasper
was
tearing
the
letter
sharply
to
pieces
anthony
has
sent
what
he
calls
an
ultimatum
he
said
trying
to
smile
and
not
succeeding
tell
the
boy
there
is
no
answer
the
messenger
on
being
so
informed
seemed
reluctant
to
believe
it
he
said
i
must
have
one
not
to
come
back
without
it
he
kept
insisting
how
anthony
crawford
had
found
any
one
to
carry
his
letter
on
this
day
when
medford
valley
seemed
quite
emptied
of
inhabitants
seemed
rather
a
mystery
yet
he
had
not
only
found
one
but
had
impressed
him
forcibly
with
the
necessity
of
fulfilling
his
errand
it
was
only
after
he
had
received
a
coin
from
oliver
pocket
and
a
large
apple
from
the
fruit
dish
in
the
dining
room
that
the
shabby
youth
finally
decided
to
go
away
he
said
i
was
to
come
back
without
an
answer
so
if
i
have
one
i
need
go
back
at
all
he
seemed
to
find
this
solution
of
the
difficulty
an
excellent
one
and
went
striding
away
whistling
cheerfully
whatever
final
threat
anthony
crawford
letter
had
contained
it
seemed
to
be
unusually
disturbing
to
cousin
jasper
having
evidently
made
up
his
mind
to
ignore
it
he
seemed
just
as
plainly
to
be
able
to
think
of
nothing
else
he
seemed
unwilling
to
be
alone
and
yet
to
be
very
bad
company
for
he
was
restless
silent
and
when
oliver
with
an
effort
tried
to
talk
of
cheerful
things
was
completely
inattentive
they
went
into
the
garden
at
last
to
see
how
the
flowers
were
faring
the
sunshine
was
more
unreal
than
ever
and
sudden
fitful
gusts
of
wind
were
beginning
to
stir
the
trees
they
had
inspected
the
flowers
and
were
halfway
across
the
lawn
on
their
way
to
the
house
when
the
sun
vanished
the
wind
rose
to
a
roar
and
before
they
could
reach
the
steps
the
blinding
rain
was
upon
them
it
was
not
an
ordinary
thunderstorm
but
one
of
those
sinister
tempests
that
occasionally
break
the
tension
of
a
hot
summer
day
oliver
inside
the
hastily
closed
windows
could
see
the
trees
lashing
helplessly
and
could
hear
them
groaning
and
snapping
as
one
great
branch
after
another
came
crashing
to
the
ground
it
was
only
a
few
minutes
that
the
furious
wind
lasted
as
it
swept
across
the
garden
but
it
left
destruction
in
its
wake
the
beds
of
lilies
were
drenched
and
flattened
the
smooth
lawn
was
strewn
with
twigs
and
broken
boughs
half
a
dozen
trees
were
split
and
one
huge
lombardy
poplar
with
a
mass
of
earth
and
roots
turned
upward
lay
prone
across
the
driveway
it
was
half
past
six
by
oliver
watch
then
seven
then
eight
no
one
had
come
home
cousin
jasper
was
growing
more
and
more
restless
and
overwrought
oliver
was
anxious
and
hungry
he
saw
his
cousin
gather
up
the
fragments
of
the
letter
piece
them
together
for
rereading
then
fling
them
from
him
once
more
the
boy
wandered
about
aimlessly
in
the
solitude
of
the
big
house
wishing
that
this
long
miserable
day
would
reach
an
end
and
that
janet
and
brown
would
come
home
it
grew
dark
and
no
one
returned
although
after
a
long
time
the
telephone
began
to
ring
it
was
brown
voice
nervous
and
only
half
audible
that
sounded
at
the
far
end
yes
she
and
miss
janet
were
quite
safe
they
had
been
under
shelter
during
the
storm
but
there
had
been
such
damage
by
the
wind
that
both
the
railway
and
the
road
were
blocked
they
would
not
be
able
to
get
home
for
some
hours
she
feared
could
you
oliver
just
slip
down
to
the
kitchen
and
make
poor
peyton
a
cup
of
tea
and
some
toast
it
is
so
bad
for
him
to
wait
so
late
for
his
dinner
you
will
find
the
tea
in
the
cupboard
and
the
butter
the
unsatisfactory
connection
cut
her
off
leaving
oliver
standing
aghast
at
her
suggestion
just
slip
down
to
the
kitchen
indeed
when
he
did
not
even
know
the
way
to
that
region
of
the
house
and
make
tea
it
seemed
an
utterly
impossible
task
through
the
long
vista
of
rooms
he
could
see
cousin
jasper
in
his
study
sitting
before
his
desk
and
fancying
himself
unseen
suddenly
bowing
his
head
in
his
hands
it
wo
do
thought
oliver
determinedly
he
must
have
some
one
to
help
him
some
one
that
knows
more
about
this
wretched
business
there
is
that
cousin
tom
he
talks
about
eleanor
father
i
ca
think
of
any
one
else
i
will
send
for
him
if
he
could
only
have
found
the
beeman
he
even
searched
the
telephone
book
for
the
name
of
marshall
but
found
none
and
he
had
never
discovered
where
the
beeman
and
polly
lived
yes
the
only
choice
was
cousin
tom
he
got
the
connection
with
some
difficulty
and
asked
for
brighton
brighton
is
at
dinner
returned
the
smooth
voice
of
a
servant
he
can
not
be
interrupted
but
this
is
very
important
insisted
oliver
i
am
quite
sure
that
if
he
knew
my
orders
are
that
he
is
not
to
be
disturbed
was
the
politely
firm
answer
while
the
boy
raged
and
fumed
impotently
then
tell
him
oliver
directed
that
his
cousin
jasper
peyton
is
in
very
great
trouble
and
needs
to
see
him
as
as
soon
as
he
finds
it
quite
convenient
his
voice
was
trembling
with
anger
and
he
slammed
down
the
receiver
without
waiting
for
a
reply
there
was
no
use
sending
for
him
after
all
he
reflected
in
black
discouragement
he
was
not
used
to
such
treatment
nor
did
he
think
that
a
man
should
surround
himself
with
so
much
ceremony
that
he
could
not
hear
a
plea
for
help
he
is
just
what
cousin
eleanor
father
would
be
was
his
disgusted
verdict
i
was
a
fool
to
hope
for
any
help
there
if
it
had
been
the
beeman
never
had
the
house
seemed
so
enormous
or
so
silent
as
it
was
he
went
out
through
a
swinging
door
attempting
to
find
the
kitchen
fumbling
down
a
passage
feeling
in
likely
places
for
electric
buttons
and
not
discovering
them
he
bumped
his
head
against
unexpected
doors
and
cupboards
he
upset
something
with
a
horrifying
crash
in
the
butler
pantry
at
last
he
found
the
right
door
and
the
proper
light
switch
and
stood
in
the
big
shining
white
kitchen
looking
about
him
helplessly
at
all
the
complicated
apparatus
of
cookery
clean
polished
and
complete
and
utterly
useless
to
him
this
is
no
place
for
a
boy
he
exclaimed
stormily
after
he
had
pinched
his
fingers
in
a
drawer
spilled
the
water
and
produced
a
roaring
spitting
flame
in
the
gas
burner
that
blew
up
in
his
face
and
then
went
out
after
fifteen
minutes
of
miserable
effort
he
at
last
heard
the
water
boil
noisily
in
the
kettle
where
he
had
placed
water
and
tea
together
he
poured
out
a
cupful
of
the
poisonous
brew
and
stood
regarding
it
in
despair
i
wish
brown
would
come
home
he
groaned
i
be
glad
of
any
woman
any
girl
even
cousin
eleanor
he
had
opened
a
window
for
the
place
was
hot
and
close
and
through
this
he
could
hear
of
a
sudden
the
sound
of
an
automobile
coming
up
the
drive
he
dashed
through
the
dark
passage
hurried
to
the
great
front
door
and
flung
it
open
there
was
a
crunching
of
big
wheels
on
the
gravel
and
the
snorting
of
an
engine
checked
suddenly
to
a
stop
it
was
not
brown
and
janet
for
though
he
heard
voices
they
were
not
theirs
the
car
had
stopped
beyond
the
fallen
tree
and
some
one
was
coming
across
the
grass
two
people
for
the
voices
were
a
man
and
a
girl
apparently
cousin
tom
had
not
stopped
to
finish
his
dinner
after
all
and
he
had
brought
cousin
eleanor
yes
i
be
glad
to
see
even
her
he
thought
desperately
the
two
came
nearer
a
man
in
white
flannels
but
bareheaded
in
the
hurry
of
his
coming
and
a
girl
in
white
also
there
was
something
familiar
in
the
swing
of
those
broad
shoulders
in
the
tone
of
that
voice
yet
oliver
stood
blinking
stupidly
holding
to
the
side
of
the
door
too
dazed
to
speak
when
the
two
stepped
out
of
the
dark
and
came
up
the
steps
the
beeman
and
polly
chapter
xi
three
cousins
good
gracious
oliver
do
you
mean
to
say
you
really
did
not
know
we
used
to
talk
it
over
polly
and
i
and
wonder
whether
you
were
not
beginning
to
see
through
us
janet
had
some
suspicions
and
when
she
met
us
at
the
fair
this
afternoon
she
understood
who
we
were
at
last
now
i
will
present
you
to
miss
eleanor
marshall
brighton
known
to
her
own
family
as
polly
i
would
not
have
broken
this
thing
to
you
so
suddenly
if
i
had
taken
time
to
think
oliver
listened
to
cousin
tom
explanations
yet
he
scarcely
heard
them
but
still
stood
leaning
against
the
doorpost
gaping
with
astonishment
of
course
he
had
always
known
that
there
was
something
unusual
about
the
beeman
but
as
to
who
he
really
was
he
had
never
had
an
inkling
and
this
was
cousin
eleanor
the
girl
he
had
pictured
so
definitely
that
it
seemed
she
could
not
be
other
than
the
prim
detested
person
he
had
so
dreaded
meeting
it
was
the
very
vividness
of
his
idea
of
her
that
had
stood
in
the
way
of
his
guessing
the
truth
but
if
the
beeman
were
really
cousin
tom
then
he
could
of
course
put
everything
right
and
more
immediate
cause
for
rejoicing
polly
could
cook
oh
come
down
to
the
kitchen
and
get
cousin
jasper
something
to
eat
he
begged
he
is
almost
starved
it
is
half
past
eight
and
he
had
lunch
at
twelve
he
gave
tom
brighton
a
rapid
account
of
what
had
happened
that
day
of
the
letter
of
cousin
jasper
increasing
agitation
of
his
final
desperate
call
for
help
on
his
own
responsibility
poor
oliver
what
a
day
you
have
had
while
the
rest
of
us
were
enjoying
ourselves
at
the
fair
said
cousin
tom
polly
and
i
happened
to
come
home
early
before
the
storm
so
that
your
message
found
us
and
we
came
at
once
and
he
is
starved
himself
put
in
polly
he
has
not
had
anything
to
eat
any
more
than
cousin
jasper
it
was
wonderful
to
watch
polly
making
short
shrift
of
the
remains
of
his
own
awkward
preparations
to
see
her
skillful
manipulation
of
the
gas
burners
and
her
marvelous
dexterity
with
the
egg
beater
and
this
slim
eager
shy
polly
with
her
crinkled
brown
hair
and
her
freckled
nose
this
was
really
eleanor
brighton
oliver
sat
down
limply
upon
one
of
the
kitchen
chairs
to
contemplate
the
wonder
of
it
anew
i
did
not
know
who
you
were
myself
that
first
day
she
said
though
daddy
guessed
at
once
and
even
suspected
that
you
were
planning
to
go
away
janet
told
us
all
about
it
this
afternoon
how
cousin
jasper
made
such
a
mistake
and
thought
that
he
could
force
you
to
meet
a
girl
that
you
were
sure
you
would
like
i
would
have
done
just
the
same
myself
if
my
father
had
tried
to
make
me
meet
you
only
he
is
too
wise
for
such
a
thing
but
oliver
could
only
shake
his
head
and
marvel
that
he
had
not
guessed
later
after
cousin
jasper
and
oliver
had
feasted
on
the
supper
of
polly
providing
they
all
gathered
about
the
table
in
the
library
and
cousin
tom
unlocked
the
battered
old
strong
box
that
he
had
brought
in
from
the
car
as
i
am
the
family
lawyer
he
explained
to
oliver
yes
bees
are
only
a
hobby
and
my
real
business
is
the
law
i
have
in
my
possession
most
of
the
records
belonging
to
this
affair
i
have
gone
into
the
whole
matter
of
anthony
claims
from
the
very
beginning
and
i
am
prepared
to
fight
him
for
every
inch
that
he
demands
he
began
taking
papers
from
the
box
fat
rolls
of
legal
documents
letters
with
their
edges
worn
into
tatters
and
addressed
in
the
crabbed
writing
of
a
century
ago
title
deeds
discolored
and
yellow
with
age
most
of
them
fastened
with
great
red
seals
a
mass
of
musty
records
that
looked
dry
and
dull
indeed
while
he
was
spreading
them
out
upon
the
table
the
door
opened
quietly
and
janet
slipped
in
she
assured
them
that
she
had
dined
and
had
not
got
wet
that
except
for
brown
terrible
fever
of
anxiety
lest
cousin
jasper
should
not
be
properly
cared
for
all
had
gone
well
might
she
listen
please
and
was
there
going
to
be
another
story
not
of
just
the
same
kind
that
i
have
been
telling
you
up
yonder
on
the
windy
hill
replied
tom
brighton
although
here
you
see
the
source
of
all
those
tales
and
of
a
hundred
others
like
them
they
are
all
buried
here
in
these
dusty
papers
the
history
of
your
forbears
and
of
the
lands
in
medford
valley
it
goes
all
the
way
back
does
the
record
to
the
time
when
our
several
times
bought
the
first
tract
from
the
indian
nashola
i
am
always
glad
to
think
that
the
red
man
had
enough
intelligence
and
the
white
man
enough
honor
to
make
something
like
a
real
bargain
that
this
valley
was
purchased
for
what
the
wild
lands
were
worth
instead
of
being
paid
for
with
a
gun
a
drink
of
bad
spirits
and
a
handful
of
beads
see
here
is
nashola
name
he
learned
to
write
after
a
fashion
although
the
indian
witnesses
signed
only
with
a
mark
and
here
is
the
signature
of
that
first
one
of
our
kin
to
settle
in
the
new
world
matthew
hallowell
hallowell
echoed
oliver
did
he
belong
to
those
same
hallowells
in
the
story
who
quarreled
over
the
yes
was
the
answer
he
was
the
beginning
of
a
vigorous
line
living
in
and
near
medford
valley
until
there
came
at
last
the
hallowell
who
moved
to
the
seaport
town
who
built
his
first
ship
there
and
launched
into
foreign
trade
they
became
great
merchants
the
hallowells
in
that
time
between
the
revolution
and
the
war
of
when
yankee
ships
and
yankee
owners
were
lords
of
the
high
seas
but
fortune
failed
after
the
death
of
reuben
hallowell
his
son
alan
loved
sailing
rather
than
trading
and
his
daughter
cicely
married
a
junior
partner
in
a
lesser
firm
howard
brighton
who
thought
it
better
for
his
sons
and
daughter
to
go
to
live
on
the
lands
in
medford
valley
that
had
belonged
to
their
mother
and
had
been
given
by
her
to
him
cicely
children
were
ralph
and
felix
and
barbara
brighton
of
all
of
whom
you
have
heard
how
have
they
heard
tom
asked
cousin
jasper
and
the
beeman
smiled
i
have
been
filling
up
their
minds
with
family
history
for
i
knew
that
they
must
understand
about
this
whole
affair
some
day
and
it
would
take
too
long
to
tell
them
all
the
facts
at
once
so
we
have
come
now
to
the
latest
portion
of
the
story
he
went
on
turning
again
to
the
younger
members
of
his
audience
to
a
period
when
three
cousins
jasper
peyton
anthony
crawford
and
tom
brighton
used
to
spend
much
time
together
when
they
were
growing
up
jasper
and
i
are
first
cousins
since
my
father
was
ralph
brighton
and
his
mother
was
that
younger
sister
barbara
i
have
had
no
reluctance
in
telling
you
of
that
bitter
mistake
my
father
made
and
the
quarrel
with
his
brother
for
he
spoke
of
it
often
himself
and
said
that
in
all
his
life
he
never
learned
a
more
valuable
lesson
felix
did
not
marry
since
his
zeal
for
the
orchard
and
the
bees
and
later
for
farming
on
a
larger
and
larger
scale
seemed
to
occupy
his
every
thought
it
was
he
who
reclaimed
the
marshy
waste
ground
in
the
valley
he
said
is
wrong
that
we
on
the
seaboard
leave
our
home
acres
and
move
farther
and
farther
westward
looking
for
new
land
that
is
easy
to
till
it
is
a
wasteful
policy
even
for
a
new
country
that
was
one
of
the
things
he
had
learned
on
his
long
journey
across
the
west
and
back
again
but
i
do
not
understand
about
anthony
crawford
put
in
oliver
i
have
seen
yet
where
he
comes
in
at
all
he
calls
us
cousin
but
it
is
a
distant
kinship
since
he
is
grandson
of
that
martin
hallowell
who
broke
with
his
partner
reuben
over
the
matter
of
the
he
used
to
come
often
to
stay
in
medford
valley
for
he
had
been
left
without
parents
and
felix
brighton
was
his
guardian
my
aunt
barbara
jasper
mother
had
lost
her
husband
early
and
she
went
to
live
with
her
brother
felix
in
the
yellow
stone
farmhouse
that
had
come
to
him
from
some
earlier
hallowell
who
had
built
it
a
hundred
years
ago
how
we
loved
the
place
and
how
happy
we
all
were
there
for
i
spent
almost
as
much
time
under
that
wide
friendly
roof
as
did
anthony
how
patient
and
good
jasper
mother
was
to
three
mischievous
active
boys
and
how
unceasingly
wisely
kind
was
felix
brighton
he
has
done
much
for
us
jasper
and
me
and
he
would
if
he
could
have
made
a
man
of
anthony
he
was
not
like
the
other
two
of
us
we
could
see
that
even
when
we
were
children
he
was
quicker
and
more
clever
than
we
and
he
was
better
or
at
least
wiser
at
holding
his
tongue
and
keeping
his
temper
when
the
occasion
served
but
the
key
to
his
whole
character
was
that
he
could
never
see
any
possession
in
the
hands
of
another
without
instinctively
wishing
to
have
it
for
himself
i
have
seen
him
move
heaven
and
earth
to
get
something
that
he
did
not
really
want
merely
because
it
seemed
of
value
when
it
belonged
to
some
one
else
there
was
no
one
more
clever
than
he
at
acquiring
what
he
desired
felix
brighton
prospered
greatly
but
he
never
moved
out
of
the
comfortable
farmhouse
of
which
we
were
all
so
fond
it
became
very
beautiful
under
his
hands
extended
and
improved
and
filled
with
the
rarest
treasures
of
his
gathering
he
was
especially
fond
of
pictures
so
that
there
was
a
wealth
of
portraits
and
landscapes
that
he
had
collected
or
inherited
that
glowed
like
jewels
on
the
mellow
old
walls
he
did
us
unnumbered
kindnesses
when
we
were
boys
and
when
on
growing
up
we
decided
that
we
would
all
three
be
lawyers
he
set
us
up
as
partners
peyton
crawford
brighton
we
felt
very
important
with
our
law
books
our
profound
knowledge
our
newly
painted
sign
and
very
little
else
even
while
we
were
studying
it
was
plain
that
anthony
in
his
erratic
changeable
way
was
the
cleverest
of
us
all
and
then
history
repeated
itself
as
it
so
often
does
the
grandson
of
martin
hallowell
and
the
two
of
reuben
fell
out
with
each
other
over
just
such
a
questionable
enterprise
as
had
wrecked
a
partnership
a
hundred
years
ago
i
can
see
him
now
as
he
came
hurrying
into
our
office
that
day
full
of
the
plan
for
his
great
scheme
just
a
quibble
of
the
law
and
the
thing
was
done
we
were
all
to
be
made
rich
and
successful
by
it
he
explained
there
is
no
use
in
describing
to
you
the
intricacies
of
his
idea
it
was
one
of
those
shoal
waters
in
which
the
honesty
of
young
lawyers
can
sometimes
come
to
grief
the
pursuit
of
law
will
winnow
out
the
true
from
the
false
it
makes
an
upright
man
a
hundred
times
more
certain
and
more
proud
of
his
honor
it
searches
out
the
small
weak
places
of
a
meaner
soul
anthony
tried
to
make
this
project
sound
quite
simple
and
straightforward
but
i
can
remember
how
narrowly
he
watched
us
and
how
when
he
attempted
to
laugh
at
our
objections
his
voice
cracked
into
shrill
falsetto
under
pressure
of
his
excitement
i
would
have
argued
with
him
explained
tried
to
dissuade
him
but
jasper
scorned
my
temporizing
and
would
have
had
none
of
it
his
sense
of
justice
blazed
high
within
him
and
his
words
leaped
forth
a
very
avalanche
of
scorn
and
wrath
anthony
heard
him
through
without
replying
then
turned
on
his
heel
and
went
out
our
partnership
was
at
an
end
later
we
heard
that
he
had
become
involved
with
his
scheme
even
before
he
spoke
to
us
that
he
had
made
himself
liable
for
a
sum
of
money
and
that
to
pay
it
do
wince
jasper
these
children
must
know
the
truth
to
pay
it
he
forged
felix
brighton
name
there
is
something
very
terrible
in
the
sudden
destruction
of
your
confidence
in
some
one
you
have
loved
and
trusted
anthony
is
greatly
changed
now
although
there
is
still
a
little
of
his
old
charm
left
yet
you
would
not
think
of
him
as
some
one
who
had
been
an
intimate
part
of
our
lives
a
comrade
whose
cleverness
we
admired
and
whose
honesty
we
had
never
doubted
and
then
he
was
suddenly
blotted
out
of
our
existence
the
wrong
he
had
done
was
hushed
up
he
disappeared
somewhere
in
the
west
and
it
seemed
that
we
were
never
to
hear
of
him
again
the
years
went
by
jasper
mother
and
then
our
uncle
felix
went
from
us
he
had
given
me
the
lands
on
the
west
side
of
the
river
since
i
was
already
owner
of
the
cottage
the
windy
hill
and
the
bees
that
he
had
taught
me
to
tend
and
love
to
jasper
he
had
given
the
yellow
stone
house
that
had
been
like
home
for
us
all
and
his
intimate
possessions
the
treasures
it
contained
he
had
given
him
also
the
drained
farm
lands
by
the
river
a
legacy
that
was
an
occupation
in
itself
he
had
seen
that
jasper
bent
was
not
really
for
the
law
but
that
his
best
calling
was
the
care
of
such
an
estate
as
this
more
years
passed
i
became
more
and
more
absorbed
in
my
own
work
down
in
the
seaport
town
that
has
become
a
city
spending
my
holidays
and
my
vacations
in
caring
for
the
bees
not
seeing
jasper
so
often
for
he
was
also
and
then
anthony
came
home
whatever
he
had
been
doing
in
all
this
time
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
he
had
altered
greatly
so
that
there
seemed
nothing
left
of
his
old
self
except
his
cleverness
some
lingering
affection
for
the
place
where
he
had
been
happy
as
a
boy
and
that
old
habit
of
coveting
what
other
people
had
he
came
back
with
a
claim
to
make
one
that
went
back
as
far
as
the
day
when
reuben
and
martin
hallowell
quarreled
and
made
a
hasty
division
of
what
had
belonged
to
them
in
common
there
had
always
been
a
slight
doubt
as
to
the
title
of
the
land
upon
which
the
yellow
stone
farmhouse
stood
and
to
the
upper
end
of
the
farms
by
the
river
anthony
knew
of
it
from
the
days
when
we
studied
law
together
and
he
came
back
determined
to
make
that
property
his
i
will
not
deny
that
he
had
some
slight
basis
for
his
claim
he
would
accept
no
compromise
or
offer
of
purchase
so
in
the
end
jasper
gave
in
to
him
cousin
jasper
had
not
spoken
throughout
tom
brighton
recounting
of
the
whole
affair
but
now
he
took
up
the
tale
himself
going
over
the
ground
that
very
evidently
he
had
pondered
and
argued
and
weighed
within
himself
a
hundred
times
i
had
much
and
he
had
nothing
he
was
in
real
want
and
had
a
wife
and
two
children
besides
there
was
as
tom
says
some
real
basis
for
his
claim
since
the
title
had
never
been
made
quite
clear
and
there
is
further
no
more
bitter
thing
than
a
family
quarrel
a
division
over
the
settlement
of
property
this
one
asking
for
what
is
more
than
his
that
one
fighting
to
hold
what
is
not
his
own
no
it
was
unthinkable
so
we
settled
the
matter
peaceably
enough
i
built
a
new
house
above
him
on
the
hill
and
he
settled
down
in
the
place
that
had
been
home
to
all
of
us
he
seemed
to
have
repented
of
the
wrong
he
had
done
and
we
were
ready
to
forget
it
i
do
not
think
that
i
ever
doubted
the
honesty
of
his
purpose
at
first
then
it
came
to
my
wishing
for
some
of
the
old
possessions
for
my
new
house
and
he
vowed
that
every
one
of
them
was
his
i
know
said
janet
nodding
quickly
he
would
give
up
the
pictures
though
he
did
not
care
for
them
himself
they
were
stored
in
the
dust
and
dirt
under
the
eaves
and
he
asked
me
if
you
had
sent
me
to
see
where
he
kept
them
he
only
wanted
them
because
they
were
yours
i
suppose
he
meant
to
sell
them
some
day
cousin
jasper
answered
for
there
were
several
that
were
of
almost
as
much
value
as
the
house
itself
but
less
than
ever
was
i
willing
to
bicker
and
haggle
over
what
i
had
really
loved
and
since
he
would
not
sell
them
to
me
i
gave
the
matter
up
even
then
there
was
a
little
justice
on
his
side
for
the
pictures
had
been
purchased
with
money
from
the
lands
that
he
called
his
but
it
was
my
great
mistake
since
he
did
not
understand
at
all
why
i
yielded
to
him
and
from
that
time
he
made
certain
that
he
had
but
to
force
me
and
i
would
relinquish
everything
oliver
muttered
something
angrily
and
went
to
stand
by
the
window
he
wanted
a
minute
to
think
it
out
to
understand
clearly
before
the
tale
went
on
he
could
see
just
how
anthony
had
read
cousin
character
sensitive
with
strong
affections
that
not
even
great
wrongs
could
quite
break
down
but
how
mistaken
the
man
had
been
who
thought
jasper
peyton
was
a
person
to
be
led
anywhere
his
success
in
getting
made
him
greedy
for
more
went
on
cousin
jasper
and
he
began
to
push
his
claims
further
and
further
until
i
verily
believe
he
began
to
think
that
everything
i
had
should
be
his
own
when
i
refused
to
yield
one
more
inch
then
the
difficulties
began
indeed
he
let
the
old
house
fall
into
unbelievable
disrepair
and
he
took
the
stand
that
since
i
was
defrauding
him
he
was
too
poor
to
do
otherwise
i
built
the
high
wall
across
the
garden
so
that
i
need
not
see
the
home
i
had
loved
dropping
to
pieces
before
my
eyes
at
that
his
anger
seemed
to
pass
beyond
control
he
claims
this
and
he
claims
that
but
i
know
that
his
final
aim
is
the
whole
of
what
i
have
he
sent
me
a
letter
i
do
not
understand
why
he
did
not
come
himself
he
says
that
he
is
about
to
take
public
action
that
he
will
bring
into
court
the
story
of
how
felix
brighton
became
his
guardian
and
used
that
position
as
a
blind
to
live
in
possession
of
anthony
inheritance
oh
i
can
not
repeat
it
all
his
threats
against
our
good
name
and
against
the
memory
of
those
who
are
gone
cousin
jasper
voice
dropped
wearily
into
silence
oliver
dug
his
hands
deep
into
his
pockets
and
stood
staring
and
scowling
out
through
the
window
although
all
that
he
saw
was
the
blackness
outside
and
the
dim
reflection
of
his
own
face
upon
the
pane
our
uncle
felix
never
had
the
least
notion
that
anthony
had
a
claim
upon
the
place
tom
brighton
was
saying
behind
him
it
was
a
legal
technicality
that
anthony
was
clever
enough
to
find
and
make
the
most
of
i
do
not
at
all
believe
in
his
right
to
it
even
yet
he
does
believe
in
it
himself
oliver
made
his
declaration
whirling
suddenly
about
upon
them
i
told
him
that
he
was
only
bluffing
and
he
could
not
even
deny
it
how
i
hate
him
he
cried
huskily
it
is
lucky
that
there
are
none
of
your
bees
near
by
just
now
jasper
peyton
looked
at
him
in
blank
inquiry
but
the
beeman
smiled
yet
shook
his
head
at
the
same
time
it
is
not
only
bees
that
are
destroyed
by
hating
he
said
it
is
every
good
thing
in
life
that
dries
up
and
blows
away
under
the
force
of
dislike
and
bitterness
look
at
anthony
who
vows
he
has
no
affection
for
any
one
who
does
not
believe
in
friends
or
kindliness
he
has
hurt
others
he
has
brought
no
happiness
to
himself
and
unless
i
am
mistaken
he
is
going
to
wreck
his
whole
scheme
in
one
tremendous
crash
that
we
can
not
now
foresee
a
lawyer
like
myself
sees
many
hard
miserable
sordid
things
but
a
beeman
has
leisure
to
speculate
as
to
whither
they
tend
and
they
all
tend
to
the
same
thing
they
sat
for
some
time
about
the
table
explaining
discussing
and
questioning
until
finally
the
muffled
booming
of
the
clock
in
the
hall
proclaimed
the
hour
of
ten
polly
eyes
were
beginning
to
look
heavy
a
fact
that
did
not
escape
her
father
watchful
observation
these
girls
have
had
a
long
day
and
it
is
time
for
them
to
be
in
bed
he
announced
we
have
been
over
this
whole
matter
and
made
things
clear
and
we
have
only
to
decide
since
we
are
to
fight
anthony
in
court
just
what
stand
we
will
make
we
will
talk
that
over
jasper
while
oliver
takes
your
car
and
drives
polly
home
i
go
with
them
said
janet
jumping
up
also
she
had
been
listening
and
alert
through
all
of
the
story
and
showed
no
signs
of
sleepiness
oliver
tore
himself
away
with
some
regret
for
he
did
not
wish
to
miss
a
word
of
the
plans
the
two
men
were
making
but
polly
was
evidently
weary
and
ready
to
go
home
come
along
cousin
eleanor
he
said
briskly
and
the
three
went
laughing
out
through
the
door
and
down
the
steps
it
was
very
dark
when
oliver
brought
out
the
big
car
and
skirting
the
fallen
tree
made
his
way
carefully
down
the
drive
a
bank
of
clouds
to
the
eastward
was
all
that
was
left
of
the
storm
however
and
through
this
the
moon
was
breaking
with
promise
to
rise
clear
and
come
out
into
an
empty
sky
oliver
slowed
down
the
car
as
they
came
to
the
gate
and
stopped
for
a
moment
to
consider
the
wind
had
dropped
so
completely
that
they
could
hear
every
sound
of
the
summer
night
even
the
dull
roar
of
the
flooded
river
do
you
know
he
began
slowly
we
never
remembered
to
tell
them
that
john
massey
has
left
his
place
i
do
think
any
one
but
ourselves
knows
that
he
went
away
immediately
they
will
be
thinking
that
he
is
still
there
watching
the
dike
and
listen
how
loud
the
river
sounds
suppose
we
go
down
and
look
said
polly
it
will
not
take
us
long
and
the
road
runs
close
to
the
bank
he
turned
the
car
accordingly
and
they
sped
down
the
steep
road
the
sky
growing
brighter
above
them
and
the
darkness
fading
as
the
moon
came
out
when
they
reached
the
last
incline
the
whole
of
the
valley
lands
spread
below
them
were
so
flooded
with
light
that
the
broad
picture
looked
like
an
etching
white
fields
black
trees
with
blacker
splashes
of
shade
pointed
shadows
of
houses
and
farm
buildings
the
silver
expanse
of
the
river
and
the
straight
white
ribbon
of
the
road
it
was
all
very
still
and
peaceful
with
scarcely
a
light
in
any
house
and
no
single
moving
figure
upon
the
highway
medford
valley
worn
out
with
its
day
of
merrymaking
was
wrapped
in
heavy
sleep
very
strangely
the
sight
of
this
unsuspecting
slumbering
community
seemed
to
fill
them
all
with
sudden
misgiving
i
hope
there
nothing
wrong
muttered
oliver
swinging
the
car
into
its
highest
speed
as
they
dashed
down
the
road
john
massey
house
lay
still
and
dark
in
the
moonlight
its
windows
staring
with
the
blank
eyes
that
an
uninhabited
dwelling
always
shows
the
moment
home
life
has
gone
out
of
it
they
stopped
the
car
near
his
gate
and
climbed
out
all
three
of
them
to
walk
at
the
foot
of
the
high
bank
and
search
for
signs
of
danger
it
looked
firm
and
solid
enough
with
its
thick
green
sod
its
fringe
of
willows
along
the
top
but
with
the
whispering
haste
of
the
river
sounding
plainly
against
its
outer
wall
standing
on
tiptoe
they
could
catch
sight
of
the
swift
sliding
water
risen
so
high
that
it
touched
the
very
top
of
the
bank
the
roar
of
the
swollen
current
could
be
heard
all
across
the
valley
but
it
was
not
so
ominous
somehow
as
the
smaller
voices
of
the
ripples
sucking
and
gurgling
so
close
to
their
ears
they
walked
along
three
ghostly
figures
in
the
moonlight
until
janet
who
happened
to
be
ahead
stopped
suddenly
i
hear
something
strange
i
do
understand
what
it
is
she
said
oliver
stepped
forward
bending
his
head
to
listen
yes
he
could
hear
it
too
the
sound
was
a
soft
hissing
as
though
a
tiny
snake
might
be
hidden
in
the
grass
at
their
feet
but
there
was
no
grass
thick
enough
for
such
shelter
only
a
few
sparse
stalks
rising
in
a
drift
of
sand
at
the
foot
of
the
dike
the
noise
was
made
by
the
moving
of
the
sand
particles
as
they
stirred
and
seethed
with
drops
of
water
bubbling
between
them
like
the
trickle
of
a
spring
as
they
watched
the
round
wet
space
widened
it
had
been
as
big
as
a
cup
now
it
was
like
a
dinner
plate
it
a
leak
in
the
bank
oliver
regarded
it
intently
thinking
it
quite
too
small
to
be
dangerous
i
ought
to
be
able
to
put
my
thumb
in
it
he
added
cheerfully
but
either
there
is
something
wrong
with
that
dutch
story
or
there
is
something
wrong
with
this
hole
it
is
a
joke
said
polly
quickly
they
always
begin
that
way
it
oh
run
run
for
the
boiling
circle
of
sand
had
changed
suddenly
to
a
spout
of
muddy
water
that
shot
upward
spreading
into
a
wide
brown
pool
that
came
washing
over
the
grass
to
hide
the
spot
where
they
had
stood
a
moment
before
from
the
higher
ground
of
the
road
they
watched
it
follow
them
rising
pausing
a
little
then
rising
again
back
up
the
car
or
you
will
have
to
drive
through
the
water
directed
polly
henry
brook
is
the
nearest
house
where
we
can
find
help
if
that
leak
is
to
be
blocked
the
men
will
have
to
be
quick
they
were
in
the
car
oliver
had
backed
it
round
almost
within
its
own
length
and
they
were
flying
up
the
road
before
polly
had
finished
speaking
once
years
ago
this
long
stretch
of
dike
caved
in
and
the
whole
current
of
the
river
came
roaring
down
through
the
bottom
lands
but
there
were
no
houses
here
then
they
came
to
a
crossroad
turned
into
it
and
stopped
short
before
a
gate
oliver
did
not
take
time
to
open
it
but
tumbled
over
the
top
raced
across
the
grass
and
thundered
at
the
door
of
a
dark
silent
house
oh
why
did
country
people
sleep
so
soundly
he
knocked
and
knocked
again
and
after
what
seemed
an
interminable
time
saw
a
light
above
and
heard
a
window
open
what
do
you
want
the
farmer
big
voice
sounded
none
too
pleased
but
it
changed
quickly
when
oliver
told
his
news
a
break
in
the
dike
where
on
anthony
crawford
land
is
it
well
that
just
where
it
would
be
we
do
any
of
us
around
here
have
much
friendship
for
crawford
of
course
if
the
leak
is
very
bad
it
will
threaten
us
all
i
spread
the
alarm
while
you
go
to
get
mr
peyton
they
were
away
up
the
road
again
but
fast
as
they
flew
the
news
seemed
to
travel
faster
the
rural
telephone
and
the
comfortable
country
habit
of
listening
in
on
every
message
can
spread
tidings
broadcast
at
a
moment
notice
the
largest
farm
at
the
foot
of
the
valley
had
a
great
bell
swung
above
its
central
barn
a
bell
whose
excited
voice
could
carry
but
one
of
two
messages
flood
or
fire
before
they
were
halfway
up
the
hill
its
wild
clanging
was
calling
all
across
the
valley
up
cousin
jasper
avenue
they
came
with
a
rush
flung
themselves
out
of
the
car
and
ran
to
the
house
the
two
men
were
still
bending
over
the
papers
cousin
jasper
with
his
thin
intent
face
listening
tom
brighton
talking
steadily
his
eyes
alight
with
that
cheerful
eager
kindliness
that
had
so
drawn
oliver
to
him
from
the
first
moment
they
both
turned
in
astonishment
as
the
three
came
bursting
in
a
break
in
the
dike
at
john
massey
place
and
where
was
john
massey
cousin
tom
questioned
sharply
gone
if
we
had
known
that
he
had
left
neither
jasper
nor
i
would
have
been
sitting
here
so
quietly
all
evening
with
the
river
in
flood
and
you
have
given
the
alarm
that
is
good
there
was
a
bustle
of
hasty
preparations
but
they
were
still
standing
in
the
hall
when
there
came
the
sound
of
flying
wheels
on
the
drive
and
the
uneven
hoofbeats
of
an
uncertain
old
horse
urged
to
utmost
speed
it
anthony
crawford
said
oliver
suddenly
the
man
came
in
the
outcast
cousin
who
had
turned
his
hand
against
them
all
his
face
was
white
his
gray
eyes
were
burning
with
excitement
his
voice
was
harsh
and
choked
when
he
tried
to
speak
the
dike
i
see
you
know
already
i
went
down
over
the
hill
to
look
and
saw
the
moonlight
on
that
pool
of
water
it
was
at
john
place
i
came
to
get
help
cousin
tom
alone
answered
why
was
john
massey
gone
he
said
oliver
stepped
forward
to
tom
brighton
side
and
looked
curiously
at
the
man
who
been
their
enemy
he
could
see
his
hands
shake
as
they
crushed
his
battered
old
hat
between
them
we
had
quarreled
anthony
crawford
explained
his
voice
suddenly
gone
little
and
husky
i
turned
him
away
three
days
ago
and
and
we
had
some
words
so
that
he
would
stay
even
overnight
after
that
he
watched
the
dike
and
now
the
water
is
coming
in
one
more
question
cousin
tom
asked
why
did
you
come
to
us
he
inquired
steadily
it
would
have
been
quicker
to
go
down
through
the
fields
to
the
farms
in
the
valley
to
call
out
henry
brook
and
send
him
with
men
and
shovels
and
sandbags
to
stop
the
flood
to
get
here
is
a
mile
by
the
road
and
there
was
no
time
to
lose
he
pressed
his
question
mercilessly
why
did
you
come
to
us
anthony
crawford
moistened
his
dry
lips
but
he
did
not
speak
there
was
a
pause
though
all
of
them
knew
that
every
second
the
waters
of
medford
river
were
sweeping
higher
and
higher
it
was
finally
tom
brighton
who
answered
his
own
question
you
were
afraid
to
go
elsewhere
it
was
your
doing
this
flood
you
took
the
land
you
neglected
the
dikes
you
sent
john
massey
away
who
would
have
watched
against
such
a
disaster
as
this
you
were
afraid
to
face
those
men
below
and
tell
them
what
you
had
done
the
other
nodded
i
have
a
friend
in
medford
valley
to
help
me
except
you
yes
i
was
afraid
to
face
them
the
break
is
in
just
the
place
where
it
may
flood
the
whole
bottom
land
i
thought
they
would
move
to
help
me
until
it
was
too
late
and
on
my
life
tom
brighton
if
we
can
stop
the
flood
i
do
not
care
what
becomes
of
me
it
was
quite
true
as
they
could
all
see
that
the
man
desperate
terror
was
not
all
for
himself
that
the
situation
was
far
too
bad
for
that
he
was
picturing
how
the
whole
torrent
of
medford
river
might
soon
be
sweeping
across
those
fields
of
ripening
grain
those
comfortable
barns
with
their
cows
and
sheep
and
horses
those
pleasant
white
farmhouses
where
a
hundred
people
lay
asleep
he
was
seeing
how
little
by
little
he
had
built
up
the
wrong
that
was
to
be
his
ruin
he
had
driven
away
his
friends
he
had
seized
the
land
he
had
turned
off
its
guardian
and
now
in
a
wild
whirlwind
the
results
of
his
misdoing
were
upon
him
he
did
not
look
at
tom
brighton
set
face
but
at
jasper
peyton
the
one
he
had
wronged
most
a
man
ca
live
without
friends
he
said
will
you
stand
by
me
jasper
not
for
what
i
deserve
but
for
what
i
need
yes
answered
jasper
peyton
he
smiled
suddenly
with
all
the
old
tense
misery
quite
gone
from
his
face
we
going
to
stand
by
you
anthony
all
of
us
we
are
with
you
still
chapter
xii
medford
river
cousin
tom
was
giving
rapid
directions
as
they
went
out
to
the
waiting
automobiles
i
will
go
on
with
jasper
and
we
will
pick
up
some
men
from
the
farms
as
we
pass
anthony
you
had
better
come
with
oliver
we
shall
want
to
crowd
in
all
the
farmers
we
can
what
is
it
polly
you
want
to
come
with
me
i
suspect
you
think
you
are
going
to
keep
your
father
out
of
danger
and
i
think
the
same
of
you
there
is
room
in
front
here
between
us
jump
in
the
engine
grumbled
and
roared
and
the
first
car
slid
away
into
the
shadows
get
in
said
oliver
curtly
to
anthony
crawford
while
janet
opened
the
door
of
the
second
motor
and
slipped
to
the
far
side
to
give
him
room
none
of
the
three
spoke
as
they
went
down
the
drive
behind
cousin
tom
as
they
came
through
the
gate
they
could
hear
faintly
the
wild
clanging
of
the
bell
in
the
valley
below
oliver
was
too
much
occupied
with
his
driving
to
have
any
other
thought
janet
was
awed
into
silence
by
the
alien
presence
at
her
side
but
anthony
crawford
in
that
same
husky
broken
voice
suddenly
began
to
speak
as
though
he
were
following
his
thoughts
out
loud
i
do
know
why
i
came
back
to
medford
valley
he
said
i
had
lived
through
every
sort
of
thing
since
i
went
away
but
i
was
making
good
at
last
martha
that
the
girl
i
married
she
was
a
daughter
had
helped
me
to
go
straight
i
was
working
in
a
mine
harder
work
than
i
had
ever
dreamed
of
in
my
life
it
was
good
for
me
yet
i
kept
telling
myself
that
it
was
being
in
prison
perhaps
it
was
but
i
had
forgotten
that
prison
was
the
place
where
i
ought
to
be
oliver
tilted
back
his
head
that
he
might
hear
better
but
his
only
answer
was
an
inarticulate
sound
like
a
mutter
of
agreement
to
reach
the
valley
as
soon
as
possible
and
without
mishap
was
more
important
to
him
at
that
moment
than
explanations
but
janet
looked
up
with
round
wondering
eyes
eager
to
hear
the
rest
i
kept
thinking
how
it
was
here
at
home
so
green
and
clean
and
peaceful
not
like
that
stark
bare
mountain
country
where
i
seemed
to
be
working
my
whole
life
away
i
told
myself
that
a
certain
portion
of
medford
valley
belonged
to
me
that
i
could
come
back
and
live
a
life
of
dignified
idleness
if
only
i
had
my
rights
if
only
jasper
would
give
me
what
was
my
own
but
it
was
true
you
knew
that
he
would
keep
what
belonged
to
you
burst
out
janet
i
knew
it
was
true
but
people
love
to
deceive
themselves
and
i
had
to
explain
to
martha
she
would
never
have
come
if
she
had
known
how
things
really
stood
she
was
unwilling
even
as
it
was
but
i
was
so
sure
i
thought
i
knew
jasper
so
well
exactly
how
i
could
threaten
him
just
where
i
could
hurt
him
most
had
i
not
learned
when
i
was
a
boy
how
proud
and
sensitive
and
generous
he
could
be
i
was
as
successful
as
i
had
hoped
to
be
but
i
wanted
more
and
more
and
see
where
it
has
brought
me
in
the
end
it
seemed
a
relief
to
him
to
confess
the
very
whole
of
his
to
leave
hidden
no
single
meanness
or
thought
it
was
as
though
in
the
clean
night
air
in
the
face
of
two
just
and
companions
he
wished
to
cast
aside
all
the
wrong
of
the
past
before
making
a
new
beginning
i
am
going
away
he
said
it
is
because
i
found
that
my
plan
did
pay
as
i
had
hoped
it
would
it
is
because
i
was
happier
back
there
in
the
west
serving
out
a
sentence
at
hard
labor
learning
to
live
by
the
work
of
my
hands
rather
than
by
my
dishonorable
wits
i
can
look
back
over
my
life
and
see
just
where
my
honesty
began
to
waver
just
when
i
first
compromised
with
my
own
conscience
and
persuaded
myself
that
something
was
fair
and
honest
when
i
knew
it
was
not
we
had
all
the
same
chance
jasper
and
tom
and
i
look
at
them
and
look
at
me
you
may
wonder
why
i
say
all
this
to
you
perhaps
it
is
because
you
alone
saw
through
me
dared
to
tell
me
that
i
had
no
confidence
even
in
my
own
claims
called
me
a
man
of
straw
and
a
bogy
well
after
i
am
going
back
to
be
a
real
man
again
for
the
first
time
oliver
slackened
the
speed
of
the
car
and
nearly
stopped
in
the
road
do
you
want
to
go
now
he
inquired
shortly
we
can
take
you
to
the
station
if
you
do
they
do
need
us
down
there
as
they
do
the
others
no
not
now
i
must
know
what
my
criminal
bungling
has
amounted
to
first
when
i
have
seen
the
flood
go
down
then
it
will
be
time
to
go
i
want
to
see
this
thing
through
they
had
straightened
out
into
the
level
road
and
were
forced
to
drive
more
slowly
for
the
highway
was
no
longer
empty
a
big
tractor
was
lumbering
ahead
farm
wagons
turned
out
for
them
to
pass
and
hastily
dressed
men
were
thronging
alongside
two
of
them
jumped
upon
the
running
board
but
seeing
who
sat
in
the
car
muttered
some
imprecation
and
dropped
off
again
anthony
crawford
stood
up
and
opened
the
door
i
walk
he
announced
briefly
load
in
all
the
men
you
can
carry
you
will
need
every
one
janet
climbed
over
to
the
place
beside
her
brother
and
the
tonneau
filled
up
with
men
who
crowded
the
seats
clung
to
the
step
and
the
fenders
and
sat
in
a
row
across
the
back
of
the
car
they
came
to
the
end
of
the
road
at
last
where
in
that
place
that
had
been
so
empty
and
quiet
half
an
hour
ago
there
was
now
gathered
a
surging
crowd
of
men
of
horses
tractors
automobiles
and
wagons
oliver
could
see
on
a
knoll
above
the
others
polly
standing
with
two
farmers
wives
the
only
women
there
at
first
he
could
not
see
the
water
but
as
they
pressed
into
the
crowd
he
caught
sight
of
the
broad
pool
dark
even
in
the
moonlight
it
was
over
the
road
now
through
the
fence
and
had
crept
halfway
across
the
stretch
of
grass
before
john
massey
door
tom
figure
was
going
back
and
forth
among
the
men
but
it
was
cousin
jasper
standing
high
above
the
others
on
the
seat
of
a
wagon
who
was
directing
operations
and
getting
this
confused
army
of
workers
into
rapid
organization
tom
take
half
the
men
to
shovel
dirt
and
pile
up
the
sand
sacks
and
send
the
other
half
back
to
the
sand
pits
to
fill
them
clear
the
road
so
that
the
wagons
can
go
back
and
forth
henry
brook
take
out
your
horses
and
join
your
team
with
johnson
the
tractor
can
pull
two
wagons
and
we
need
four
horses
to
each
of
the
others
now
go
to
it
and
bring
the
sandbags
as
fast
as
they
can
be
filled
we
ca
save
john
massey
house
but
we
will
build
a
dam
to
hold
the
water
a
hundred
yards
back
where
the
ground
begins
to
rise
and
remember
you
ca
be
too
quick
if
you
want
to
save
the
valley
oliver
took
off
his
coat
and
jumped
out
of
the
car
go
over
where
polly
is
he
told
janet
i
am
going
into
this
game
with
the
others
he
was
in
every
portion
of
it
as
the
night
wore
by
never
quite
knowing
how
he
passed
from
one
task
to
another
but
following
orders
blindly
hour
after
hour
he
helped
to
dig
but
was
not
quite
so
quick
as
the
others
he
carried
the
sacks
of
sand
that
were
brought
up
loaded
high
upon
the
wagons
but
he
had
not
the
quick
swing
of
the
more
sturdy
farmers
he
found
himself
at
last
on
the
high
vibrating
seat
of
the
heavy
tractor
rumbling
down
the
road
with
a
line
of
wagons
behind
him
stopping
at
the
sand
pits
to
have
them
filled
then
turning
laboriously
to
haul
them
back
again
the
owner
sat
beside
him
on
the
first
trip
directing
him
how
to
manage
the
unfamiliar
machine
but
as
they
made
ready
for
a
second
he
ejaculated
you
do
and
jumped
down
to
labor
with
the
diggers
oliver
was
left
to
drive
his
clumsy
powerful
steed
alone
he
saw
the
broad
semicircular
wall
of
piled
sandbags
banked
with
earth
rise
slowly
as
the
men
worked
with
feverish
haste
he
saw
the
water
come
up
to
the
foot
of
it
seem
to
hesitate
and
then
creep
up
the
side
he
saw
suddenly
just
as
they
had
all
stopped
to
breathe
a
long
portion
of
the
dike
begin
to
tremble
then
cave
in
with
a
hideous
sucking
crash
that
shook
the
ground
under
them
he
saw
the
flood
of
muddy
water
come
roaring
in
and
sweep
against
the
painfully
built
rampart
which
swayed
and
crumbled
to
its
fall
in
a
wild
turmoil
of
running
shouting
men
backing
wagons
and
rearing
horses
he
managed
to
extricate
the
clumsy
monster
that
had
been
put
under
his
care
brought
it
laboring
and
snorting
out
on
higher
ground
and
fell
to
work
again
the
barrier
they
had
set
up
with
so
much
toil
was
tumbling
and
collapsing
in
great
gaps
where
the
hungry
current
flung
against
it
but
it
held
just
long
enough
for
them
to
raise
another
wall
longer
higher
firmer
than
the
other
and
built
with
the
frantic
haste
of
desperate
men
the
hours
went
by
it
was
long
after
midnight
with
the
sky
growing
pale
for
the
morning
once
or
twice
oliver
had
seen
anthony
crawford
working
among
the
rest
carrying
sacks
of
sand
jostled
and
cursed
by
the
men
about
him
but
in
spite
of
their
abuse
toiling
steadily
onward
when
the
dike
collapsed
and
the
men
ran
for
their
lives
one
wagon
lurched
off
the
road
its
driver
was
flung
from
the
seat
and
caught
under
the
wheel
while
the
horses
having
jammed
the
tongue
against
the
bank
reared
and
plunged
helplessly
oliver
saw
anthony
crawford
run
out
with
the
swift
muddy
water
flowing
around
him
watched
him
extricate
the
man
drag
him
to
the
seat
and
back
the
frantic
horses
away
from
the
bank
to
bring
them
struggling
through
the
water
to
safety
there
was
no
time
for
words
of
commendation
both
men
at
once
went
back
to
their
task
of
carrying
sacks
as
the
slow
building
of
another
wall
began
some
one
had
built
a
fire
on
the
knoll
and
here
the
farmers
wives
with
janet
and
polly
among
them
were
boiling
coffee
frying
bacon
and
serving
out
food
to
the
hungry
men
oliver
had
munched
a
generous
sandwich
as
he
drove
down
the
road
as
he
came
back
again
he
noticed
a
strange
lull
and
observed
that
the
men
were
leaning
on
their
shovels
and
that
the
work
had
ceased
tom
brighton
wet
and
muddy
from
head
to
foot
motioned
him
to
come
near
we
done
all
we
can
the
big
farmer
beside
them
was
saying
the
sacks
are
nearly
gone
and
the
men
are
dead
beat
if
she
breaks
through
now
the
whole
valley
will
have
to
go
under
the
water
was
halfway
up
the
side
of
the
wall
and
was
still
rising
here
and
there
a
muddy
trickle
came
oozing
through
to
be
stopped
by
a
clod
of
earth
but
otherwise
there
was
nothing
to
do
to
oliver
it
seemed
that
they
stood
for
hours
staring
waiting
as
the
water
lifted
slowly
rose
half
an
inch
paused
and
rose
again
it
was
of
the
way
up
it
was
a
foot
below
the
lip
of
the
wall
the
space
of
a
foot
dwindled
to
six
inches
if
there
should
be
a
wind
now
said
the
man
beside
him
hoarsely
oliver
looked
back
along
the
valley
at
the
arch
of
sky
showing
blue
instead
of
gray
at
the
trees
moving
gently
in
a
morning
breeze
that
touched
the
hilltop
but
that
did
not
stir
the
still
air
below
he
heard
tom
brighton
suddenly
draw
a
sharp
breath
and
he
looked
back
quickly
was
that
space
above
the
water
a
little
wider
was
there
a
wet
black
line
that
stretched
all
along
the
rough
wall
where
the
flood
had
touched
and
fallen
again
he
was
not
dreaming
it
was
true
the
level
of
the
muddy
tide
was
dropping
the
crest
of
the
flood
had
passed
it
was
broad
daylight
now
with
the
morning
sunlight
moving
slowly
down
the
slope
into
the
valley
for
the
first
time
oliver
could
see
clearly
the
sullen
yellow
pool
of
water
the
crevasse
in
the
dike
and
john
massey
little
house
submerged
to
its
very
eaves
he
watched
the
shining
streak
of
wet
earth
that
marked
the
drop
in
the
water
he
saw
it
broaden
into
a
ribbon
and
from
a
ribbon
turn
into
a
wide
glistening
zone
of
safety
that
proved
to
all
the
danger
had
gone
by
we
can
go
now
said
cousin
tom
at
last
there
is
work
enough
still
to
do
but
it
is
time
for
us
all
to
rest
a
little
we
are
certainly
a
wet
and
crew
they
had
breakfast
all
of
the
cousins
together
at
cousin
house
where
brown
having
spent
half
the
night
wringing
her
hands
in
helpless
anxiety
had
seemed
to
spend
the
other
half
superintending
the
preparation
of
a
feast
that
should
be
truly
worthy
of
the
occasion
the
guests
were
all
cheerful
and
were
still
so
keyed
up
by
the
struggle
of
the
night
that
they
did
not
yet
feel
weariness
anthony
crawford
sat
on
one
side
of
cousin
jasper
tom
brighton
on
the
other
while
the
three
younger
members
of
the
party
watched
them
wonderingly
from
the
other
end
of
the
table
everything
for
the
moment
seemed
forgotten
except
the
old
comradeship
of
their
boyhood
the
only
reminder
of
the
unhappy
days
just
passed
lay
in
the
atmosphere
of
relief
and
peacefulness
that
seemed
to
pervade
the
whole
house
the
windows
stood
wide
open
and
the
morning
wind
came
in
to
lift
the
long
curtains
and
to
stir
the
great
bowl
of
flowers
on
the
table
oliver
hungrily
devouring
chicken
and
rolls
and
bacon
and
sausages
and
hot
waffles
with
maple
sirup
was
saying
little
but
was
listening
earnestly
to
the
jokes
and
laughter
of
cousin
jasper
after
a
day
and
night
of
anxiety
depression
struggle
and
victory
he
seemed
suddenly
to
have
become
a
new
man
they
were
talking
the
three
elders
of
their
early
adventures
together
but
oliver
noticed
that
the
reminiscences
never
traveled
beyond
a
certain
year
that
their
stories
would
go
forward
to
the
time
when
they
were
nearly
grown
and
then
would
slip
back
to
their
younger
days
again
some
black
memory
was
laid
across
the
happy
recollection
of
their
friendship
cutting
off
all
that
came
after
yet
they
talked
and
laughed
easily
of
the
bright
remote
happiness
that
was
common
to
them
all
the
boy
noticed
also
as
they
sat
together
that
anthony
was
like
the
others
in
certain
ways
that
his
eyes
could
light
with
the
same
merriment
as
cousin
jasper
and
that
his
chin
was
cut
in
the
same
determined
line
as
tom
brighton
yet
no
there
was
something
about
his
face
that
never
could
be
quite
like
theirs
they
had
finished
at
last
and
anthony
crawford
pushing
back
his
chair
came
abruptly
out
of
the
past
into
the
present
he
thrust
his
hand
into
the
inner
pocket
of
his
coat
and
brought
out
some
papers
like
those
that
cousin
tom
had
locked
away
in
the
tin
box
here
is
the
deed
that
you
made
out
jasper
for
the
house
and
the
land
that
you
gave
up
to
me
i
put
it
in
my
pocket
yesterday
morning
it
seems
a
year
ago
the
purpose
i
had
then
is
something
that
i
would
rather
forget
if
i
ever
can
but
this
is
what
i
do
with
it
now
he
tore
the
heavy
paper
into
pieces
smaller
and
smaller
as
though
he
could
not
demolish
completely
enough
the
record
of
what
he
had
demanded
the
breeze
from
the
garden
sent
the
scraps
fluttering
over
the
table
and
across
the
rug
it
carried
the
round
red
seal
along
the
tablecloth
and
dropped
it
into
janet
lap
tom
will
have
to
make
out
some
official
papers
he
said
but
i
want
you
to
understand
this
fully
that
there
among
those
fragments
lies
the
end
of
this
whole
affair
cousin
jasper
was
about
to
speak
but
tom
brighton
broke
in
ahead
of
him
it
has
turned
out
better
than
we
could
have
hoped
anthony
he
began
so
that
we
can
all
agree
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
anthony
crawford
turned
very
slowly
and
looked
with
those
penetrating
gray
eyes
at
oliver
we
owe
a
great
deal
to
these
children
here
he
said
and
as
for
one
of
them
convinced
that
something
was
about
to
be
said
of
him
oliver
got
up
quickly
pretending
that
it
was
merely
because
he
had
finished
his
breakfast
and
wished
to
be
excused
hurried
across
the
room
and
slipped
out
through
one
of
the
long
windows
that
opened
on
the
terrace
he
could
still
hear
anthony
crawford
voice
however
in
the
room
behind
him
saying
it
was
these
children
who
found
the
leak
in
the
dike
it
was
oliver
who
thought
of
going
to
look
for
it
it
was
oliver
who
saw
through
me
saw
that
i
had
not
a
shred
of
honor
or
honesty
behind
my
claim
and
told
me
what
i
was
the
boy
moved
farther
away
from
the
window
so
that
he
could
not
hear
and
stood
his
hands
clenched
on
the
terrace
rail
looking
out
over
the
garden
across
the
pools
of
color
and
stretches
of
green
lawn
over
the
wall
and
down
the
white
road
that
led
away
the
length
of
the
valley
no
matter
what
words
they
might
speak
of
him
they
could
never
make
him
forget
how
he
had
walked
away
down
that
road
meaning
to
leave
all
this
vaguely
understood
trouble
behind
him
only
a
chance
meeting
the
beeman
friendly
smile
the
interest
of
a
story
that
had
caught
him
for
a
moment
and
all
would
have
been
changed
no
there
should
be
no
words
of
praise
for
him
the
voices
were
louder
behind
him
for
the
three
men
were
passing
through
the
library
and
cousin
jasper
was
speaking
just
within
we
still
have
to
talk
over
this
matter
of
rebuilding
the
dike
he
said
we
must
have
your
advice
in
that
anthony
go
into
the
study
anthony
crawford
replied
i
must
speak
to
oliver
for
a
moment
he
came
out
through
the
window
while
the
others
walked
on
together
oliver
turned
to
face
him
i
am
going
now
anthony
said
quietly
i
thought
you
would
be
ready
to
help
me
when
it
was
time
oliver
reddened
when
he
remembered
the
promptness
of
his
offer
the
evening
before
do
you
need
to
go
he
said
awkwardly
when
you
are
friends
again
with
every
one
here
even
the
men
in
the
valley
do
hate
you
he
added
bluntly
after
what
you
did
last
night
i
believe
cousin
jasper
will
want
you
to
stay
if
i
let
him
tell
me
so
i
will
not
go
the
other
replied
quickly
it
must
be
this
minute
while
my
mind
is
still
made
up
or
never
i
will
write
to
martha
to
follow
i
can
not
even
trust
myself
to
wait
for
her
it
is
better
that
i
should
go
better
for
them
in
the
study
there
better
for
the
community
for
myself
even
better
for
you
oliver
i
know
come
he
insisted
as
the
boy
still
hesitated
my
confidence
in
you
will
be
less
great
if
you
do
not
tell
me
that
you
know
it
also
yes
returned
oliver
grudgingly
at
last
yes
i
know
it
too
they
drove
away
down
the
empty
road
with
the
early
morning
wind
rushing
about
their
ears
as
they
climbed
to
the
highest
ridge
anthony
crawford
stood
up
to
look
back
down
the
green
length
of
medford
valley
yet
he
did
not
speak
until
they
had
reached
the
station
with
the
train
thundering
in
just
as
they
drew
up
beside
the
platform
oliver
he
said
briefly
the
boy
knew
that
the
word
of
farewell
was
not
for
him
but
for
all
that
the
man
was
leaving
friends
memories
the
place
that
he
had
loved
in
his
strange
crooked
way
all
that
he
was
putting
behind
him
forever
a
bell
rang
a
voice
shouted
the
unintelligible
something
that
stands
for
all
aboard
the
train
ground
into
motion
and
he
was
gone
almost
every
one
in
medford
valley
must
have
slept
that
morning
through
the
long
hours
until
far
past
noon
but
by
four
oliver
had
slumbered
all
his
weariness
away
and
so
had
janet
they
were
restless
after
their
excitement
of
the
night
before
and
they
found
the
house
very
still
and
with
cousin
jasper
nowhere
visible
they
went
out
to
the
garage
got
into
the
car
and
set
off
along
the
familiar
way
toward
the
windy
hill
just
to
see
if
they
are
there
as
oliver
said
to
janet
they
came
up
the
slope
through
the
grass
and
saw
the
blue
wood
smoke
rising
lazily
above
them
unmistakable
signal
that
the
beeman
was
at
work
polly
greeted
them
gayly
for
she
like
them
was
quite
refreshed
by
the
hours
of
slumber
that
had
passed
her
father
still
looked
weary
as
though
he
had
spent
the
interval
in
troubled
thought
rather
than
sleep
but
he
hailed
them
cheerily
all
up
and
down
the
hill
was
a
subdued
and
busy
humming
for
the
day
after
rain
is
the
best
of
all
seasons
for
bees
to
gather
honey
we
thought
we
must
find
out
what
the
storm
had
done
to
our
hives
the
beeman
said
only
three
were
blown
over
but
there
must
have
been
a
great
commotion
now
we
have
everything
set
to
rights
and
we
are
not
in
the
mood
to
tell
the
truth
for
a
great
deal
more
work
are
you
too
tired
janet
asked
for
for
a
story
no
he
answered
stories
come
easily
for
a
man
who
has
had
training
as
polly
father
i
thought
there
was
no
one
like
her
for
demanding
stories
but
you
are
just
such
another
they
sat
down
on
the
grass
with
the
broad
shadow
of
the
oak
tree
lying
all
about
them
and
stretching
farther
and
farther
as
the
afternoon
sun
moved
down
the
sky
they
had
chosen
the
steeper
slope
of
the
hill
so
that
they
could
look
down
upon
the
whole
length
of
the
winding
stream
the
scattered
and
the
wide
green
of
those
gardenlike
stretches
that
still
lay
safe
and
serene
ripening
their
grain
beside
the
river
the
beeman
eyes
moved
up
and
down
the
valley
resting
longest
upon
the
slope
opposite
where
the
yellow
farmhouse
stood
at
the
edge
of
its
grove
of
trees
and
showed
its
wide
gray
roof
its
white
thread
of
pathway
leading
up
to
the
door
its
row
of
broad
windows
that
were
beginning
to
flash
and
shine
under
the
touch
of
the
level
rays
of
the
sun
poor
anthony
he
said
slowly
at
last
to
be
banished
from
a
place
he
loved
so
much
and
yet
a
person
thinks
it
a
little
thing
when
he
first
confuses
right
with
wrong
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
then
turned
to
the
girls
with
his
old
cheery
smile
a
story
he
repeated
it
will
not
be
like
the
others
a
tale
from
old
dusty
chronicles
of
medford
valley
to
tell
you
things
that
you
should
know
we
have
lived
the
last
chapter
of
that
tale
and
now
we
will
go
on
to
something
new
oliver
leaned
back
luxuriously
in
the
grass
to
stare
up
at
the
clear
sky
and
the
dark
outline
of
the
oak
tree
against
the
blue
its
heavy
branches
were
just
stirring
in
the
unfailing
breeze
that
blew
in
from
the
sea
and
its
rustling
mingled
sleepily
with
the
beeman
voice
as
he
began
once
upon
a
time
