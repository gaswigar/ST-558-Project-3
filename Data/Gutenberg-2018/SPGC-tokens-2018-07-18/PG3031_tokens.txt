the

partridge
these
stories
are
true
although
i
have
left
the
strict
line
of
historical
truth
in
many
places
the
animals
in
this
book
were
all
real
characters
they
lived
the
lives
i
have
depicted
and
showed
the
stamp
of
heroism
and
personality
more
strongly
by
far
than
it
has
been
in
the
power
of
my
pen
to
tell
i
believe
that
natural
history
has
lost
much
by
the
vague
general
treatment
that
is
so
common
what
satisfaction
would
be
derived
from
a
sketch
of
the
habits
and
customs
of
man
how
much
more
profitable
it
would
be
to
devote
that
space
to
the
life
of
some
one
great
man
this
is
the
principle
i
have
endeavored
to
apply
to
my
animals
the
real
personality
of
the
individual
and
his
view
of
life
are
my
theme
rather
than
the
ways
of
the
race
in
general
as
viewed
by
a
casual
and
hostile
human
eye
this
may
sound
inconsistent
in
view
of
my
having
pieced
together
some
of
the
characters
but
that
was
made
necessary
by
the
fragmentary
nature
of
the
records
there
is
however
almost
no
deviation
from
the
truth
in
lobo
bingo
and
the
mustang
lobo
lived
his
wild
romantic
life
from
to
in
the
currumpaw
region
as
the
ranchmen
know
too
well
and
died
precisely
as
related
on
january
bingo
was
my
dog
from
to
in
spite
of
interruptions
caused
by
lengthy
visits
to
new
york
as
my
manitoban
friends
will
remember
and
my
old
friend
the
owner
of
tan
will
learn
from
these
pages
how
his
dog
really
died
the
mustang
lived
not
far
from
lobo
in
the
early
nineties
the
story
is
given
strictly
as
it
occurred
excepting
that
there
is
a
dispute
as
to
the
manner
of
his
death
according
to
some
testimony
he
broke
his
neck
in
the
corral
that
he
was
first
taken
to
old
turkeytrack
is
where
he
can
not
be
consulted
to
settle
it
wully
is
in
a
sense
a
compound
of
two
dogs
both
were
mongrels
of
some
collie
blood
and
were
raised
as
the
first
part
of
wully
is
given
as
it
happened
after
that
it
was
known
only
that
he
became
a
savage
treacherous
the
details
of
the
second
part
belong
really
to
another
a
similar
yaller
dog
who
long
lived
the
faithful
by
day
and
a
bloodthirsty
treacherous
monster
by
night
such
things
are
less
rare
than
is
supposed
and
since
writing
these
stories
i
have
heard
of
another
that
added
to
its
night
amusements
the
crowning
barbarity
of
murdering
the
smaller
dogs
of
the
neighborhood
he
had
killed
twenty
and
hidden
them
in
a
sandpit
when
discovered
by
his
master
he
died
just
as
wully
did
all
told
i
now
have
information
of
six
of
these
dogs
in
each
case
it
happened
to
be
a
collie
redruff
really
lived
in
the
don
valley
north
of
toronto
and
many
of
my
companions
will
remember
him
he
was
killed
in
between
the
sugar
loaf
and
castle
frank
by
a
creature
whose
name
i
have
withheld
as
it
is
the
species
rather
than
the
individual
that
i
wish
to
expose
silverspot
raggylug
and
vixen
are
founded
on
real
characters
though
i
have
ascribed
to
them
the
adventures
of
more
than
one
of
their
kind
every
incident
in
their
biographies
is
from
life
the
fact
that
these
stories
are
true
is
the
reason
why
all
are
tragic
the
life
of
a
wild
animal
always
has
a
tragic
end
such
a
collection
of
histories
naturally
suggests
a
common
thought
a
moral
it
would
have
been
called
in
the
last
century
no
doubt
each
different
mind
will
find
a
moral
to
its
taste
but
i
hope
some
will
herein
find
emphasized
a
moral
as
old
as
scripture
we
and
the
beasts
are
kin
man
has
nothing
that
the
animals
have
not
at
least
a
vestige
of
the
animals
have
nothing
that
man
does
not
in
some
degree
share
since
then
the
animals
are
creatures
with
wants
and
feelings
differing
in
degree
only
from
our
own
they
surely
have
their
rights
this
fact
now
beginning
to
be
recognized
by
the
caucasian
world
was
first
proclaimed
by
moses
and
was
emphasized
by
the
buddhist
over
years
ago
ernest
thompson
seton
lobo
the
king
of
currumpaw
i
currumpaw
is
a
vast
cattle
range
in
northern
new
mexico
it
is
a
land
of
rich
pastures
and
teeming
flocks
and
herds
a
land
of
rolling
mesas
and
precious
running
waters
that
at
length
unite
in
the
currumpaw
river
from
which
the
whole
region
is
named
and
the
king
whose
despotic
power
was
felt
over
its
entire
extent
was
an
old
gray
wolf
old
lobo
or
the
king
as
the
mexicans
called
him
was
the
gigantic
leader
of
a
remarkable
pack
of
gray
wolves
that
had
ravaged
the
currumpaw
valley
for
a
number
of
years
all
the
shepherds
and
ranchmen
knew
him
well
and
wherever
he
appeared
with
his
trusty
band
terror
reigned
supreme
among
the
cattle
and
wrath
and
despair
among
their
owners
old
lobo
was
a
giant
among
wolves
and
was
cunning
and
strong
in
proportion
to
his
size
his
voice
at
night
was
and
easily
distinguished
from
that
of
any
of
his
fellows
an
ordinary
wolf
might
howl
half
the
night
about
the
herdsman
bivouac
without
attracting
more
than
a
passing
notice
but
when
the
deep
roar
of
the
old
king
came
booming
down
the
canon
the
watcher
bestirred
himself
and
prepared
to
learn
in
the
morning
that
fresh
and
serious
inroads
had
been
made
among
the
herds
old
lobo
band
was
but
a
small
one
this
i
never
quite
understood
for
usually
when
a
wolf
rises
to
the
position
and
power
that
he
had
he
attracts
a
numerous
following
it
may
be
that
he
had
as
many
as
he
desired
or
perhaps
his
ferocious
temper
prevented
the
increase
of
his
pack
certain
is
it
that
lobo
had
only
five
followers
during
the
latter
part
of
his
reign
each
of
these
however
was
a
wolf
of
renown
most
of
them
were
above
the
ordinary
size
one
in
particular
the
second
in
command
was
a
veritable
giant
but
even
he
was
far
below
the
leader
in
size
and
prowess
several
of
the
band
besides
the
two
leaders
were
especially
noted
one
of
those
was
a
beautiful
white
wolf
that
the
mexicans
called
blanca
this
was
supposed
to
be
a
female
possibly
lobo
mate
another
was
a
yellow
wolf
of
remarkable
swiftness
which
according
to
current
stories
had
on
several
occasions
captured
an
antelope
for
the
pack
it
will
be
seen
then
that
these
wolves
were
thoroughly
to
the
cowboys
and
shepherds
they
were
frequently
seen
and
oftener
heard
and
their
lives
were
intimately
associated
with
those
of
the
cattlemen
who
would
so
gladly
have
destroyed
them
there
was
not
a
stockman
on
the
currumpaw
who
would
not
readily
have
given
the
value
of
many
steers
for
the
scalp
of
any
one
of
lobo
band
but
they
seemed
to
possess
charmed
lives
and
defied
all
manner
of
devices
to
kill
them
they
scorned
all
hunters
derided
all
poisons
and
continued
for
at
least
five
years
to
exact
their
tribute
from
the
currumpaw
ranchers
to
the
extent
many
said
of
a
cow
each
day
according
to
this
estimate
therefore
the
band
had
killed
more
than
two
thousand
of
the
finest
stock
for
as
was
only
too
they
selected
the
best
in
every
instance
the
old
idea
that
a
wolf
was
constantly
in
a
starving
state
and
therefore
ready
to
eat
anything
was
as
far
as
possible
from
the
truth
in
this
case
for
these
freebooters
were
always
sleek
and
and
were
in
fact
most
fastidious
about
what
they
ate
any
animal
that
had
died
from
natural
causes
or
that
was
diseased
or
tainted
they
would
not
touch
and
they
even
rejected
anything
that
had
been
killed
by
the
stockmen
their
choice
and
daily
food
was
the
tenderer
part
of
a
freshly
killed
yearling
heifer
an
old
bull
or
cow
they
disdained
and
though
they
occasionally
took
a
young
calf
or
colt
it
was
quite
clear
that
veal
or
horseflesh
was
not
their
favorite
diet
it
was
also
known
that
they
were
not
fond
of
mutton
although
they
often
amused
themselves
by
killing
sheep
one
night
in
november
blanca
and
the
yellow
wolf
killed
two
hundred
and
fifty
sheep
apparently
for
the
fun
of
it
and
did
not
eat
an
ounce
of
their
flesh
these
are
examples
of
many
stories
which
i
might
repeat
to
show
the
ravages
of
this
destructive
band
many
new
devices
for
their
extinction
were
tried
each
year
but
still
they
lived
and
throve
in
spite
of
all
the
efforts
of
their
foes
a
great
price
was
set
on
lobo
head
and
in
consequence
poison
in
a
score
of
subtle
forms
was
put
out
for
him
but
he
never
failed
to
detect
and
avoid
it
one
thing
only
he
feared
that
was
firearms
and
knowing
full
well
that
all
men
in
this
region
carried
them
he
never
was
known
to
attack
or
face
a
human
being
indeed
the
set
policy
of
his
band
was
to
take
refuge
in
flight
whenever
in
the
daytime
a
man
was
descried
no
matter
at
what
distance
lobo
habit
of
permitting
the
pack
to
eat
only
that
which
they
themselves
had
killed
was
in
numerous
cases
their
salvation
and
the
keenness
of
his
scent
to
detect
the
taint
of
human
hands
or
the
poison
itself
completed
their
immunity
on
one
occasion
one
of
the
cowboys
heard
the
too
familiar
of
old
lobo
and
stealthily
approaching
he
found
the
currumpaw
pack
in
a
hollow
where
they
had
up
a
small
herd
of
cattle
lobo
sat
apart
on
a
knoll
while
blanca
with
the
rest
was
endeavoring
to
out
a
young
cow
which
they
had
selected
but
the
cattle
were
standing
in
a
compact
mass
with
their
heads
outward
and
presented
to
the
foe
a
line
of
horns
unbroken
save
when
some
cow
frightened
by
a
fresh
onset
of
the
wolves
tried
to
retreat
into
the
middle
of
the
herd
it
was
only
by
taking
advantage
of
these
breaks
that
the
wolves
had
succeeded
at
all
in
wounding
the
selected
cow
but
she
was
far
from
being
disabled
and
it
seemed
that
lobo
at
length
lost
patience
with
his
followers
for
he
left
his
position
on
the
hill
and
uttering
a
deep
roar
dashed
toward
the
herd
the
terrified
rank
broke
at
his
charge
and
he
sprang
in
among
them
then
the
cattle
scattered
like
the
pieces
of
a
bursting
bomb
away
went
the
chosen
victim
but
ere
she
had
gone
yards
lobo
was
upon
her
seizing
her
by
the
neck
he
suddenly
held
back
with
all
his
force
and
so
threw
her
heavily
to
the
ground
the
shock
must
have
been
tremendous
for
the
heifer
was
thrown
heels
over
head
lobo
also
turned
a
somersault
but
immediately
recovered
himself
and
his
followers
falling
on
the
poor
cow
killed
her
in
a
few
seconds
lobo
took
no
part
in
the
killing
after
having
thrown
the
victim
he
seemed
to
say
now
why
could
not
some
of
you
have
done
that
at
once
without
wasting
so
much
time
the
man
now
rode
up
shouting
the
wolves
as
usual
retired
and
he
having
a
bottle
of
strychnine
quickly
poisoned
the
carcass
in
three
places
then
went
away
knowing
they
would
return
to
feed
as
they
had
killed
the
animal
themselves
but
next
morning
on
going
to
look
for
his
expected
victims
he
found
that
although
the
wolves
had
eaten
the
heifer
they
had
carefully
cut
out
and
thrown
aside
all
those
parts
that
had
been
poisoned
the
dread
of
this
great
wolf
spread
yearly
among
the
ranchmen
and
each
year
a
larger
price
was
set
on
his
head
until
at
last
it
reached
an
unparalleled
surely
many
a
good
man
has
been
hunted
down
for
less
tempted
by
the
promised
reward
a
texan
ranger
named
tannerey
came
one
day
galloping
up
the
canyon
of
the
currumpaw
he
had
a
superb
outfit
for
the
best
of
guns
and
horses
and
a
pack
of
enormous
far
out
on
the
plains
of
the
panhandle
he
and
his
dogs
had
killed
many
a
wolf
and
now
he
never
doubted
that
within
a
few
days
old
lobo
scalp
would
dangle
at
his
saddlebow
away
they
went
bravely
on
their
hunt
in
the
gray
dawn
of
a
summer
morning
and
soon
the
great
dogs
gave
joyous
tongue
to
say
that
they
were
already
on
the
track
of
their
quarry
within
two
miles
the
grizzly
band
of
currumpaw
leaped
into
view
and
the
chase
grew
fast
and
furious
the
part
of
the
was
merely
to
hold
the
wolves
at
bay
till
the
hunter
could
ride
up
and
shoot
them
and
this
usually
was
easy
on
the
open
plains
of
texas
but
here
a
new
feature
of
the
country
came
into
play
and
showed
how
well
lobo
had
chosen
his
range
for
the
rocky
canyons
of
the
currumpaw
and
its
tributaries
intersect
the
prairies
in
every
direction
the
old
wolf
at
once
made
for
the
nearest
of
these
and
by
crossing
it
got
rid
of
the
horseman
his
band
then
scattered
and
thereby
scattered
the
dogs
and
when
they
reunited
at
a
distant
point
of
course
all
of
the
dogs
did
not
turn
up
and
the
wolves
no
longer
outnumbered
turned
on
their
pursuers
and
killed
or
desperately
wounded
them
all
that
night
when
tannerey
mustered
his
dogs
only
six
of
them
returned
and
of
these
two
were
terribly
lacerated
this
hunter
made
two
other
attempts
to
capture
the
royal
scalp
but
neither
of
them
was
more
successful
than
the
first
and
on
the
last
occasion
his
best
horse
met
its
death
by
a
fall
so
he
gave
up
the
chase
in
disgust
and
went
back
to
texas
leaving
lobo
more
than
ever
the
despot
of
the
region
next
year
two
other
hunters
appeared
determined
to
win
the
promised
bounty
each
believed
he
could
destroy
this
noted
wolf
the
first
by
means
of
a
newly
devised
poison
which
was
to
be
laid
out
in
an
entirely
new
manner
the
other
a
french
canadian
by
poison
assisted
with
certain
spells
and
charms
for
he
firmly
believed
that
lobo
was
a
veritable
and
could
not
be
killed
by
ordinary
means
but
cunningly
compounded
poisons
charms
and
incantations
were
all
of
no
avail
against
this
grizzly
devastator
he
made
his
weekly
rounds
and
daily
banquets
as
aforetime
and
before
many
weeks
had
passed
calone
and
laloche
gave
up
in
despair
and
went
elsewhere
to
hunt
in
the
spring
of
after
his
unsuccessful
attempt
to
capture
lobo
joe
calone
had
a
humiliating
experience
which
seems
to
show
that
the
big
wolf
simply
scorned
his
enemies
and
had
absolute
confidence
in
himself
calone
farm
was
on
a
small
tributary
of
the
currumpaw
in
a
picturesque
canyon
and
among
the
rocks
of
this
very
canyon
within
a
thousand
yards
of
the
house
old
lobo
and
his
mate
selected
their
den
and
raised
their
family
that
season
there
they
lived
all
summer
and
killed
joe
cattle
sheep
and
dogs
but
laughed
at
all
his
poisons
and
traps
and
rested
securely
among
the
recesses
of
the
cavernous
cliffs
while
joe
vainly
racked
his
brain
for
some
method
of
smoking
them
out
or
of
reaching
them
with
dynamite
but
they
escaped
entirely
unscathed
and
continued
their
ravages
as
before
there
where
he
lived
all
last
summer
said
joe
pointing
to
the
face
of
the
cliff
and
i
could
do
a
thing
with
him
i
was
like
a
fool
to
him
ii
this
history
gathered
so
far
from
the
cowboys
i
found
hard
to
believe
until
in
the
fall
of
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
wily
marauder
and
at
length
came
to
know
him
more
thoroughly
than
anyone
else
some
years
before
in
the
bingo
days
i
had
been
a
but
my
occupations
since
then
had
been
of
another
sort
chaining
me
to
stool
and
desk
i
was
much
in
need
of
a
change
and
when
a
friend
who
was
also
a
on
the
currumpaw
asked
me
to
come
to
new
mexico
and
try
if
i
could
do
anything
with
this
predatory
pack
i
accepted
the
invitation
and
eager
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
its
king
was
as
soon
as
possible
among
the
mesas
of
that
region
i
spent
some
time
riding
about
to
learn
the
country
and
at
intervals
my
guide
would
point
to
the
skeleton
of
a
cow
to
which
the
hide
still
adhered
and
remark
some
of
his
work
it
became
quite
clear
to
me
that
in
this
rough
country
it
was
useless
to
think
of
pursuing
lobo
with
hounds
and
horses
so
that
poison
or
traps
were
the
only
available
expedients
at
present
we
had
no
traps
large
enough
so
i
set
to
work
with
poison
i
need
not
enter
into
the
details
of
a
hundred
devices
that
i
employed
to
circumvent
this
there
was
no
combination
of
strychnine
arsenic
cyanide
or
prussic
acid
that
i
did
not
essay
there
was
no
manner
of
flesh
that
i
did
not
try
as
bait
but
morning
after
morning
as
i
rode
forth
to
learn
the
result
i
found
that
all
my
efforts
had
been
useless
the
old
king
was
too
cunning
for
me
a
single
instance
will
show
his
wonderful
sagacity
acting
on
the
hint
of
an
old
trapper
i
melted
some
cheese
together
with
the
kidney
fat
of
a
freshly
killed
heifer
stewing
it
in
a
china
dish
and
cutting
it
with
a
bone
knife
to
avoid
the
taint
of
metal
when
the
mixture
was
cool
i
cut
it
into
lumps
and
making
a
hole
in
one
side
of
each
lump
i
inserted
a
large
dose
of
strychnine
and
cyanide
contained
in
a
capsule
that
was
impermeable
by
any
odor
finally
i
sealed
the
holes
up
with
pieces
of
the
cheese
itself
during
the
whole
process
i
wore
a
pair
of
gloves
steeped
in
the
hot
blood
of
the
heifer
and
even
avoided
breathing
on
the
baits
when
all
was
ready
i
put
them
in
a
bag
rubbed
all
over
with
blood
and
rode
forth
dragging
the
liver
and
kidneys
of
the
beef
at
the
end
of
a
rope
with
this
i
made
a
circuit
dropping
a
bait
at
each
quarter
of
a
mile
and
taking
the
utmost
care
always
not
to
touch
any
with
my
hands
lobo
generally
came
into
this
part
of
the
range
in
the
early
part
of
each
week
and
passed
the
latter
part
it
was
supposed
around
the
base
of
sierra
grande
this
was
monday
and
that
same
evening
as
we
were
about
to
retire
i
heard
the
deep
bass
howl
of
his
majesty
on
hearing
it
one
of
the
boys
briefly
remarked
there
he
is
we
see
the
next
morning
i
went
forth
eager
to
know
the
result
i
soon
came
on
the
fresh
trail
of
the
robbers
with
lobo
in
the
lead
his
track
was
always
easily
distinguished
an
ordinary
wolf
forefoot
is
inches
long
that
of
a
large
wolf
inches
but
lobo
as
measured
a
number
of
times
was
inches
from
claw
to
heel
i
afterward
found
that
his
other
proportions
were
commensurate
for
he
stood
three
feet
high
at
the
shoulder
and
weighed
pounds
his
trail
therefore
though
obscured
by
those
of
his
followers
was
never
difficult
to
trace
the
pack
had
soon
found
the
track
of
my
drag
and
as
usual
followed
it
i
could
see
that
lobo
had
come
to
the
first
bait
sniffed
about
it
and
finally
had
picked
it
up
then
i
could
not
conceal
my
delight
i
got
him
at
last
i
exclaimed
i
shall
find
him
stark
within
a
mile
and
i
galloped
on
with
eager
eyes
fixed
on
the
great
broad
track
in
the
dust
it
led
me
to
the
second
bait
and
that
also
was
gone
how
i
exulted
i
surely
have
him
now
and
perhaps
several
of
his
band
but
there
was
the
broad
pawmark
still
on
the
drag
and
though
i
stood
in
the
stirrup
and
scanned
the
plain
i
saw
nothing
that
looked
like
a
dead
wolf
again
i
followed
to
find
now
that
the
third
bait
was
gone
and
the
track
led
on
to
the
fourth
there
to
learn
that
he
had
not
really
taken
a
bait
at
all
but
had
merely
carried
them
in
his
mouth
then
having
piled
the
three
on
the
fourth
he
scattered
filth
over
them
to
express
his
utter
contempt
for
my
devices
after
this
he
left
my
drag
and
went
about
his
business
with
the
pack
he
guarded
so
effectively
this
is
only
one
of
many
similar
experiences
which
convinced
me
that
poison
would
never
avail
to
destroy
this
robber
and
though
i
continued
to
use
it
while
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
traps
it
was
only
because
it
was
meanwhile
a
sure
means
of
killing
many
prairie
wolves
and
other
destructive
vermin
about
this
time
there
came
under
my
observation
an
incident
that
will
illustrate
lobo
diabolic
cunning
these
wolves
had
at
least
one
pursuit
which
was
merely
an
amusement
it
was
stampeding
and
killing
sheep
though
they
rarely
ate
them
the
sheep
are
usually
kept
in
flocks
of
from
one
thousand
to
three
thousand
under
one
or
more
shepherds
at
night
they
are
gathered
in
the
most
sheltered
place
available
and
a
herdsman
sleeps
on
each
side
of
the
flock
to
give
additional
protection
sheep
are
such
senseless
creatures
that
they
are
liable
to
be
stampeded
by
the
veriest
trifle
but
they
have
deeply
ingrained
in
their
nature
one
and
perhaps
only
one
strong
weakness
namely
to
follow
their
leader
and
this
the
shepherds
turn
to
good
account
by
putting
half
a
dozen
goats
in
the
flock
of
sheep
the
latter
recognize
the
superior
intelligence
of
their
bearded
cousins
and
when
a
night
alarm
occurs
they
crowd
around
them
and
usually
are
thus
saved
from
a
stampede
and
are
easily
protected
but
it
was
not
always
so
one
night
late
in
last
november
two
perico
shepherds
were
aroused
by
an
onset
of
wolves
their
flocks
huddled
around
the
goats
which
being
neither
fools
nor
cowards
stood
their
ground
and
were
bravely
defiant
but
alas
for
them
no
common
wolf
was
heading
this
attack
old
lobo
the
werewolf
knew
as
well
as
the
shepherds
that
the
goats
were
the
moral
force
of
the
flock
so
hastily
running
over
the
backs
of
the
densely
packed
sheep
he
fell
on
these
leaders
slew
them
all
in
a
few
minutes
and
soon
had
the
luckless
sheep
stampeding
in
a
thousand
different
directions
for
weeks
afterward
i
was
almost
daily
accosted
by
some
anxious
shepherd
who
asked
have
you
seen
any
stray
oto
sheep
lately
and
usually
i
was
obliged
to
say
i
had
one
day
it
was
yes
i
came
on
some
five
or
six
carcasses
by
diamond
springs
or
another
it
was
to
the
effect
that
i
had
seen
a
small
bunch
running
on
the
malpai
mesa
or
again
no
but
juan
meira
saw
about
twenty
freshly
killed
on
the
cedra
monte
two
days
ago
at
length
the
wolf
traps
arrived
and
with
two
men
i
worked
a
whole
week
to
get
them
properly
set
out
we
spared
no
labor
or
pains
i
adopted
every
device
i
could
think
of
that
might
help
to
insure
success
the
second
day
after
the
traps
arrived
i
rode
around
to
inspect
and
soon
came
upon
lobo
trail
running
from
trap
to
trap
in
the
dust
i
could
read
the
whole
story
of
his
doings
that
night
he
had
trotted
along
in
the
darkness
and
although
the
traps
were
so
carefully
concealed
he
had
instantly
detected
the
first
one
stopping
the
onward
march
of
the
pack
he
had
cautiously
scratched
around
it
until
he
had
disclosed
the
trap
the
chain
and
the
log
then
left
them
wholly
exposed
to
view
with
the
trap
still
unsprung
and
passing
on
he
treated
over
a
dozen
traps
in
the
same
fashion
very
soon
i
noticed
that
he
stopped
and
turned
aside
as
soon
as
he
detected
suspicious
signs
on
the
trail
and
a
new
plan
to
outwit
him
at
once
suggested
itself
i
set
the
traps
in
the
form
of
an
h
that
is
with
a
row
of
traps
on
each
side
of
the
trail
and
one
on
the
trail
for
the
of
the
before
long
i
had
an
opportunity
to
count
another
failure
lobo
came
trotting
along
the
trail
and
was
fairly
between
the
parallel
lines
before
he
detected
the
single
trap
in
the
trail
but
he
stopped
in
time
and
why
or
how
he
knew
enough
i
can
not
tell
the
angel
of
the
wild
things
must
have
been
with
him
but
without
turning
an
inch
to
the
right
or
left
he
slowly
and
cautiously
backed
on
his
own
tracks
putting
each
paw
exactly
in
its
old
track
until
he
was
off
the
dangerous
ground
then
returning
at
one
side
he
scratched
clods
and
stones
with
his
hind
feet
till
he
had
sprung
every
trap
this
he
did
on
many
other
occasions
and
although
i
varied
my
methods
and
redoubled
my
precautions
he
was
never
deceived
his
sagacity
seemed
never
at
fault
and
he
might
have
been
pursuing
his
career
of
rapine
but
for
an
unfortunate
alliance
that
proved
his
ruin
and
added
his
name
to
the
long
list
of
heroes
who
unassailable
when
alone
have
fallen
through
the
indiscretion
of
a
trusted
ally
iii
once
or
twice
i
had
found
indications
that
everything
was
not
quite
right
in
the
currumpaw
pack
there
were
signs
of
irregularity
i
thought
for
instance
there
was
clearly
the
trail
of
a
smaller
wolf
running
ahead
of
the
leader
at
times
and
this
i
could
not
understand
until
a
cowboy
made
a
remark
which
explained
the
matter
i
saw
them
he
said
and
the
wild
one
that
breaks
away
is
blanca
then
the
truth
dawned
upon
me
and
i
added
now
i
know
that
blanca
is
a
because
were
a
to
act
thus
lobo
would
kill
him
at
once
this
suggested
a
new
plan
i
killed
a
heifer
and
set
one
or
two
rather
obvious
traps
about
the
carcass
then
cutting
off
the
head
which
is
considered
useless
offal
and
quite
beneath
the
notice
of
a
wolf
i
set
it
a
little
apart
and
around
it
placed
six
powerful
steel
traps
properly
deodorized
and
concealed
with
the
utmost
care
during
my
operations
i
kept
my
hands
boots
and
implements
smeared
with
fresh
blood
and
afterward
sprinkled
the
ground
with
the
same
as
though
it
had
flowed
from
the
head
and
when
the
traps
were
buried
in
the
dust
i
brushed
the
place
over
with
the
skin
of
a
coyote
and
with
a
foot
of
the
same
animal
made
a
number
of
tracks
over
the
traps
the
head
was
so
placed
that
there
was
a
narrow
passage
between
it
and
some
tussocks
and
in
this
passage
i
buried
two
of
my
best
traps
fastening
them
to
the
head
itself
wolves
have
a
habit
of
approaching
every
carcass
they
get
the
wind
of
in
order
to
examine
it
even
when
they
have
no
intention
of
eating
it
and
i
hoped
that
this
habit
would
bring
the
currumpaw
pack
within
reach
of
my
latest
stratagem
i
did
not
doubt
that
lobo
would
detect
my
handiwork
about
the
meat
and
prevent
the
pack
approaching
it
but
i
did
build
some
hopes
on
the
head
for
it
looked
as
though
it
had
been
thrown
aside
as
useless
next
morning
i
sallied
forth
to
inspect
the
traps
and
there
oh
joy
were
the
tracks
of
the
pack
and
the
place
where
the
and
its
traps
had
been
was
empty
a
hasty
study
of
the
trail
showed
that
lobo
had
kept
the
pack
from
approaching
the
meat
but
one
a
small
wolf
had
evidently
gone
on
to
examine
the
head
as
it
lay
apart
and
had
walked
right
into
one
of
the
traps
we
set
out
on
the
trail
and
within
a
mile
discovered
that
the
hapless
wolf
was
blanca
away
she
went
however
at
a
gallop
and
although
encumbered
by
the
which
weighed
over
fifty
pounds
she
speedily
distanced
my
companion
who
was
on
foot
but
we
overtook
her
when
she
reached
the
rocks
for
the
horns
of
the
cow
head
became
caught
and
held
her
fast
she
was
the
handsomest
wolf
i
had
ever
seen
her
coat
was
in
perfect
condition
and
nearly
white
she
turned
to
fight
and
raising
her
voice
in
the
rallying
cry
of
her
race
sent
a
long
howl
rolling
over
the
canyon
from
far
away
upon
the
mesa
came
a
deep
response
the
cry
of
old
lobo
that
was
her
last
call
for
now
we
had
closed
in
on
her
and
all
her
energy
and
breath
were
devoted
to
combat
then
followed
the
inevitable
tragedy
the
idea
of
which
i
shrank
from
afterward
more
than
at
the
time
we
each
threw
a
lasso
over
the
neck
of
the
doomed
wolf
and
strained
our
horses
in
opposite
directions
until
the
blood
burst
from
her
mouth
her
eyes
glazed
her
limbs
stiffened
and
then
fell
limp
homeward
then
we
rode
carrying
the
dead
wolf
and
exulting
over
this
the
first
we
had
been
able
to
inflict
on
the
currumpaw
pack
at
intervals
during
the
tragedy
and
afterward
as
we
rode
homeward
we
heard
the
roar
of
lobo
as
he
wandered
about
on
the
distant
mesas
where
he
seemed
to
be
searching
for
blanca
he
had
never
really
deserted
her
but
knowing
that
he
could
not
save
her
his
dread
of
firearms
had
been
too
much
for
him
when
he
saw
us
approaching
all
that
day
we
heard
him
wailing
as
he
roamed
in
his
quest
and
i
remarked
at
length
to
one
of
the
boys
now
indeed
i
truly
know
that
blanca
was
his
mate
as
evening
fell
he
seemed
to
be
coming
toward
the
home
canyon
for
his
voice
sounded
continually
nearer
there
was
an
unmistakable
note
of
sorrow
in
it
now
it
was
no
longer
the
loud
defiant
howl
but
a
long
plaintive
wail
blanca
blanca
he
seemed
to
call
and
as
night
came
down
i
noticed
that
he
was
not
far
from
the
place
where
we
had
overtaken
her
at
length
he
seemed
to
find
the
trail
and
when
he
came
to
the
spot
where
we
had
killed
her
his
heartbroken
wailing
was
piteous
to
hear
it
was
sadder
than
i
could
possibly
have
believed
even
the
stolid
cowboys
noticed
it
and
said
they
had
never
heard
a
wolf
carry
on
like
that
before
he
seemed
to
know
exactly
what
had
taken
place
for
her
blood
had
stained
the
place
of
her
death
then
he
took
up
the
trail
of
the
horses
and
followed
it
to
the
whether
in
hopes
of
finding
her
there
or
in
quest
of
revenge
i
know
not
but
the
latter
was
what
he
found
for
he
surprised
our
unfortunate
watchdog
outside
and
tore
him
to
little
bits
within
fifty
yards
of
the
door
he
evidently
came
alone
this
time
for
i
found
but
one
trail
next
morning
and
he
had
galloped
about
in
a
reckless
manner
that
was
very
unusual
with
him
i
had
half
expected
this
and
had
set
a
number
of
additional
traps
about
the
pasture
afterward
i
found
that
he
had
indeed
fallen
into
one
of
these
but
such
was
his
strength
he
had
torn
himself
loose
and
cast
it
aside
i
believed
that
he
would
continue
in
the
neighborhood
until
he
found
her
body
at
least
so
i
concentrated
all
my
energies
on
this
one
enterprise
of
catching
him
before
he
left
the
region
and
while
yet
in
this
reckless
mood
then
i
realized
what
a
mistake
i
had
made
in
killing
blanca
for
by
using
her
as
a
decoy
i
might
have
secured
him
the
next
night
i
gathered
in
all
the
traps
i
could
command
one
hundred
and
thirty
strong
steel
and
set
them
in
fours
in
every
trail
that
led
into
the
canyon
each
trap
was
separately
fastened
to
a
log
and
each
log
was
separately
buried
in
burying
them
i
carefully
removed
the
sod
and
every
particle
of
earth
that
was
lifted
we
put
in
blankets
so
that
after
the
sod
was
replaced
and
all
was
finished
the
eye
could
detect
no
trace
of
human
handiwork
when
the
traps
were
concealed
i
trailed
the
body
of
poor
blanca
over
each
place
and
made
of
it
a
drag
that
circled
all
about
the
ranch
and
finally
i
took
off
one
of
her
paws
and
made
with
it
a
line
of
tracks
over
each
trap
every
precaution
and
device
known
to
me
i
used
and
retired
at
a
late
hour
to
await
the
result
once
during
the
night
i
thought
i
heard
old
lobo
but
was
not
sure
of
it
next
day
i
rode
around
but
darkness
came
on
before
i
completed
the
circuit
of
the
north
canon
and
i
had
nothing
to
report
at
supper
one
of
the
cowboys
said
there
was
a
great
row
among
the
cattle
in
the
north
canyon
this
morning
maybe
there
is
something
in
the
traps
there
it
was
afternoon
of
the
next
day
before
i
got
to
the
place
referred
to
and
as
i
drew
near
a
great
grizzly
form
arose
from
the
ground
vainly
endeavoring
to
escape
and
there
revealed
before
me
stood
lobo
king
of
the
currumpaw
firmly
held
in
the
traps
poor
old
hero
he
had
never
ceased
to
search
for
his
darling
and
when
he
found
the
trail
her
body
had
made
he
followed
it
recklessly
and
so
fell
into
the
snare
prepared
for
him
there
he
lay
in
the
iron
grasp
of
all
four
traps
perfectly
helpless
and
all
around
him
were
numerous
tracks
showing
how
the
cattle
had
gathered
about
him
to
insult
the
fallen
despot
without
daring
to
approach
within
his
reach
for
two
days
and
two
nights
he
had
lain
there
and
now
was
worn
out
with
struggling
yet
when
i
went
near
him
he
rose
up
with
bristling
mane
and
raised
his
voice
and
for
the
last
time
made
the
canyon
reverberate
with
his
deep
bass
roar
a
call
for
help
the
muster
call
of
his
band
but
there
was
none
to
answer
him
and
left
alone
in
his
extremity
he
whirled
about
with
all
his
strength
and
made
a
desperate
effort
to
get
at
me
all
in
vain
each
trap
was
a
dead
drag
of
over
three
hundred
pounds
and
in
their
relentless
fourfold
grasp
with
great
steel
jaws
on
every
foot
and
the
heavy
logs
and
chains
all
entangled
together
he
was
absolutely
powerless
how
his
huge
ivory
tusks
did
grind
on
those
cruel
chains
and
when
i
ventured
to
touch
him
with
my
he
left
grooves
on
it
which
are
there
to
this
day
his
eyes
glared
green
with
hate
and
fury
and
his
jaws
snapped
with
a
hollow
as
he
vainly
endeavored
to
reach
me
and
my
trembling
horse
but
he
was
worn
out
with
hunger
and
struggling
and
loss
of
blood
and
he
soon
sank
exhausted
to
the
ground
something
like
compunction
came
over
me
as
i
prepared
to
deal
out
to
him
that
which
so
many
had
suffered
at
his
hands
grand
old
outlaw
hero
of
a
thousand
lawless
raids
in
a
few
minutes
you
will
be
but
a
great
load
of
carrion
it
can
not
be
otherwise
then
i
swung
my
lasso
and
sent
it
whistling
over
his
head
but
not
so
fast
he
was
yet
far
from
being
subdued
and
before
the
supple
coils
had
fallen
on
his
neck
he
seized
the
noose
and
with
one
fierce
chop
cut
through
its
hard
thick
strands
and
dropped
it
in
two
pieces
at
his
feet
of
course
i
had
my
rifle
as
a
last
resource
but
i
did
not
wish
to
spoil
his
royal
hide
so
i
galloped
back
to
the
camp
and
returned
with
a
cowboy
and
a
fresh
lasso
we
threw
to
our
victim
a
stick
of
wood
which
he
seized
in
his
teeth
and
before
he
could
relinquish
it
our
lassoes
whistled
through
the
air
and
tightened
on
his
neck
yet
before
the
light
had
died
from
his
fierce
eyes
i
cried
stay
we
will
not
kill
him
let
us
take
him
alive
to
the
camp
he
was
so
completely
powerless
now
that
it
was
easy
to
put
a
stout
stick
through
his
mouth
behind
his
tusks
and
then
lash
his
jaws
with
a
heavy
cord
which
was
also
fastened
to
the
stick
the
stick
kept
the
cord
in
and
the
cord
kept
the
stick
in
so
he
was
harmless
as
soon
as
he
felt
his
jaws
were
tied
he
made
no
further
resistance
and
uttered
no
sound
but
looked
calmly
at
us
and
seemed
to
say
well
you
have
got
me
at
last
do
as
you
please
with
me
and
from
that
time
he
took
no
more
notice
of
us
we
tied
his
feet
securely
but
he
never
groaned
nor
growled
nor
turned
his
head
then
with
our
united
strength
we
were
just
able
to
put
him
on
my
horse
his
breath
came
evenly
as
though
sleeping
and
his
eyes
were
bright
and
clear
again
but
did
not
rest
on
us
afar
on
the
great
rolling
mesas
they
were
fixed
his
passing
kingdom
where
his
famous
band
was
now
scattered
and
he
gazed
till
the
pony
descended
the
pathway
into
the
canyon
and
the
rocks
cut
off
the
view
by
travelling
slowly
we
reached
the
ranch
in
safety
and
after
securing
him
with
a
collar
and
a
strong
chain
we
staked
him
out
in
the
pasture
and
removed
the
cords
then
for
the
first
time
i
could
examine
him
closely
and
proved
how
unreliable
is
vulgar
report
when
a
living
hero
or
tyrant
is
concerned
he
had
not
a
collar
of
gold
about
his
neck
nor
was
there
on
his
shoulders
an
inverted
cross
to
denote
that
he
had
leagued
himself
with
satan
but
i
did
find
on
one
haunch
a
great
broad
scar
that
tradition
says
was
the
of
juno
the
leader
of
tannerey
a
mark
which
she
gave
him
the
moment
before
he
stretched
her
lifeless
on
the
sand
of
the
canyon
i
set
meat
and
water
beside
him
but
he
paid
no
heed
he
lay
calmly
on
his
breast
and
gazed
with
those
steadfast
yellow
eyes
away
past
me
down
through
the
gateway
of
the
canyon
over
the
open
plains
his
plains
nor
moved
a
muscle
when
i
touched
him
when
the
sun
went
down
he
was
still
gazing
fixedly
across
the
prairie
i
expected
he
would
call
up
his
band
when
night
came
and
prepared
for
them
but
he
had
called
once
in
his
extremity
and
none
had
come
he
would
never
call
again
a
lion
shorn
of
his
strength
an
eagle
robbed
of
his
freedom
or
a
dove
bereft
of
his
mate
all
die
it
is
said
of
a
broken
heart
and
who
will
aver
that
this
grim
bandit
could
bear
the
brunt
this
only
i
know
that
when
the
morning
dawned
he
was
lying
there
still
in
his
position
of
calm
repose
his
body
unwounded
but
his
spirit
was
gone
the
old
kingwolf
was
dead
i
took
the
chain
from
his
neck
a
cowboy
helped
me
to
carry
him
to
the
shed
where
lay
the
remains
of
blanca
and
as
we
laid
him
beside
her
the
exclaimed
there
you
would
come
to
her
now
you
are
together
again
silverspot
the
story
of
a
crow
i
how
many
of
us
have
ever
got
to
know
a
wild
animal
i
do
not
mean
merely
to
meet
with
one
once
or
twice
or
to
have
one
in
a
cage
but
to
really
know
it
for
a
long
time
while
it
is
wild
and
to
get
an
insight
into
its
life
and
history
the
trouble
usually
is
to
know
one
creature
from
his
fellow
one
fox
or
crow
is
so
much
like
another
that
we
can
not
be
sure
that
it
really
is
the
same
next
time
we
meet
but
once
in
awhile
there
arises
an
animal
who
is
stronger
or
wiser
than
his
fellow
who
becomes
a
great
leader
who
is
as
we
would
say
a
genius
and
if
he
is
bigger
or
has
some
mark
by
which
men
can
know
him
he
soon
becomes
famous
in
his
country
and
shows
us
that
the
life
of
a
wild
animal
may
be
far
more
interesting
and
exciting
than
that
of
many
human
beings
of
this
class
were
courtant
the
wolf
that
terrorized
the
whole
city
of
paris
for
about
ten
years
in
the
beginning
of
the
fourteenth
century
clubfoot
the
lame
grizzly
bear
that
left
such
a
terrific
record
in
the
san
joaquin
valley
of
california
lobo
the
of
new
mexico
that
killed
a
cow
every
day
for
five
years
and
the
seonee
panther
that
in
less
than
two
years
killed
nearly
three
hundred
human
beings
and
such
also
was
silverspot
whose
history
so
far
as
i
could
learn
it
i
shall
now
briefly
tell
silverspot
was
simply
a
wise
old
crow
his
name
was
given
because
of
the
silvery
white
spot
that
was
like
a
nickel
stuck
on
his
right
side
between
the
eye
and
the
bill
and
it
was
owing
to
this
spot
that
i
was
able
to
know
him
from
the
other
crows
and
put
together
the
parts
of
his
history
that
came
to
my
knowledge
crows
are
as
you
must
know
our
most
intelligent
as
an
old
crow
did
not
become
a
saying
without
good
reason
crows
know
the
value
of
organization
and
are
as
well
drilled
as
soldiers
very
much
better
than
some
soldiers
in
fact
for
crows
are
always
on
duty
always
at
war
and
always
dependent
on
each
other
for
life
and
safety
their
leaders
not
only
are
the
oldest
and
wisest
of
the
band
but
also
the
strongest
and
bravest
for
they
must
be
ready
at
any
time
with
sheer
force
to
put
down
an
upstart
or
a
rebel
the
rank
and
file
are
the
youngsters
and
the
crows
without
special
gifts
old
silverspot
was
the
leader
of
a
large
band
of
crows
that
made
their
headquarters
near
toronto
canada
in
castle
frank
which
is
a
hill
on
the
northeast
edge
of
the
city
this
band
numbered
about
two
hundred
and
for
reasons
that
i
never
understood
did
not
increase
in
mild
winters
they
stayed
along
the
niagara
river
in
cold
winters
they
went
much
farther
south
but
each
year
in
the
last
week
of
february
old
silverspot
would
muster
his
followers
and
boldly
cross
the
forty
miles
of
open
water
that
lies
between
toronto
and
niagara
not
however
in
a
straight
line
would
he
go
but
always
in
a
curve
to
the
west
whereby
he
kept
in
sight
of
the
familiar
landmark
of
dundas
mountain
until
the
hill
itself
came
in
view
each
year
he
came
with
his
troop
and
for
about
six
weeks
took
up
his
abode
on
the
hill
each
morning
thereafter
the
crows
set
out
in
three
bands
to
forage
one
band
went
southeast
to
ashbridge
bay
one
went
north
up
the
don
and
one
the
largest
went
northwestward
up
the
ravine
the
last
silverspot
led
in
person
who
led
the
others
i
never
found
out
on
calm
mornings
they
flew
high
and
straight
away
but
when
it
was
windy
the
band
flew
low
and
followed
the
ravine
for
shelter
my
windows
overlooked
the
ravine
and
it
was
thus
that
in
i
first
noticed
this
old
crow
i
was
a
newcomer
in
the
neighborhood
but
an
old
resident
said
to
me
then
that
there
old
crow
has
been
up
and
down
this
ravine
for
more
than
twenty
years
my
chances
to
watch
were
in
the
ravine
and
silverspot
doggedly
clinging
to
the
old
route
though
now
it
was
edged
with
houses
and
spanned
by
bridges
became
a
very
familiar
acquaintance
twice
each
day
in
march
and
part
of
april
then
again
in
the
late
summer
and
the
fall
he
passed
and
repassed
and
gave
me
chances
to
see
his
movements
and
hear
his
orders
to
his
bands
and
so
little
by
little
opened
my
eyes
to
the
fact
that
the
crows
though
a
little
people
are
of
great
wit
a
race
of
birds
with
a
language
and
a
social
system
that
is
wonderfully
human
in
many
of
its
chief
points
and
in
some
is
better
carried
out
than
our
own
one
windy
day
i
stood
on
the
high
bridge
across
the
ravine
as
the
old
crow
heading
his
long
straggling
troop
came
flying
down
homeward
half
a
mile
away
i
could
hear
the
contented
well
come
right
along
as
we
should
say
or
as
he
put
it
and
as
also
his
lieutenant
echoed
it
at
the
rear
of
the
band
they
were
flying
very
low
to
be
out
of
the
wind
and
would
have
to
rise
a
little
to
clear
the
bridge
on
which
i
was
silverspot
saw
me
standing
there
and
as
i
was
closely
watching
him
he
did
like
it
he
checked
his
flight
and
called
out
on
your
guard
and
rose
much
higher
in
the
air
then
seeing
that
i
was
not
armed
he
flew
over
my
head
about
twenty
feet
and
his
followers
in
turn
did
the
same
dipping
again
to
the
old
level
when
past
the
bridge
next
day
i
was
at
the
same
place
and
as
the
crows
came
near
i
raised
my
walking
stick
and
pointed
it
at
them
the
old
fellow
at
once
cried
out
and
rose
fifty
feet
higher
than
before
seeing
that
it
was
not
a
gun
he
ventured
to
fly
over
but
on
the
third
day
i
took
with
me
a
gun
and
at
once
he
cried
out
danger
a
gun
his
lieutenant
repeated
the
cry
and
every
crow
in
the
troop
began
to
tower
and
scatter
from
the
rest
till
they
were
far
above
gun
shot
and
so
passed
safely
over
coming
down
again
to
the
shelter
of
the
valley
when
well
beyond
reach
another
time
as
the
long
straggling
troop
came
down
the
valley
a
hawk
alighted
on
a
tree
close
by
their
intended
route
the
leader
cried
out
hawk
and
stayed
his
flight
as
did
each
crow
on
nearing
him
until
all
were
massed
in
a
solid
body
then
no
longer
fearing
the
hawk
they
passed
on
but
a
quarter
of
a
mile
farther
on
a
man
with
a
gun
appeared
below
and
the
cry
danger
a
gun
a
gun
scatter
fur
your
lives
at
once
caused
them
to
scatter
widely
and
tower
till
far
beyond
range
many
others
of
his
words
of
command
i
learned
in
the
course
of
my
long
acquaintance
and
found
that
sometimes
a
very
little
difference
in
the
sound
makes
a
very
great
difference
in
meaning
thus
while
no
means
hawk
or
any
large
dangerous
bird
this
means
around
evidently
a
combination
of
no
whose
root
idea
is
danger
and
of
no
whose
root
idea
is
retreat
and
this
again
is
a
mere
day
to
a
far
away
comrade
this
is
usually
addressed
to
the
ranks
and
means
early
in
april
there
began
to
be
great
doings
among
the
crows
some
new
cause
of
excitement
seemed
to
have
come
on
them
they
spent
half
the
day
among
the
pines
instead
of
foraging
from
dawn
till
dark
pairs
and
trios
might
be
seen
chasing
each
other
and
from
time
to
time
they
showed
off
in
various
feats
of
flight
a
favorite
sport
was
to
dart
down
suddenly
from
a
great
height
toward
some
perching
crow
and
just
before
touching
it
to
turn
at
a
hairbreadth
and
rebound
in
the
air
so
fast
that
the
wings
of
the
swooper
whirred
with
a
sound
like
distant
thunder
sometimes
one
crow
would
lower
his
head
raise
every
feather
and
coming
close
to
another
would
gurgle
out
a
long
note
like
what
did
it
all
mean
i
soon
learned
they
were
making
love
and
pairing
off
the
males
were
showing
off
their
wing
powers
and
their
voices
to
the
lady
crows
and
they
must
have
been
highly
appreciated
for
by
the
middle
of
april
all
had
mated
and
had
scattered
over
the
country
for
their
honeymoon
leaving
the
sombre
old
pines
of
castle
frank
deserted
and
silent
ii
the
sugar
loaf
hill
stands
alone
in
the
don
valley
it
is
still
covered
with
woods
that
join
with
those
of
castle
frank
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
in
the
woods
between
the
two
hills
is
a
in
whose
top
is
a
deserted
hawk
nest
every
toronto
knows
the
nest
and
excepting
that
i
had
once
shot
a
black
squirrel
on
its
edge
no
one
had
ever
seen
a
sign
of
life
about
it
there
it
was
year
after
year
ragged
and
old
and
falling
to
pieces
yet
strange
to
tell
in
all
that
time
it
never
did
drop
to
pieces
like
other
old
nests
one
morning
in
may
i
was
out
at
gray
dawn
and
stealing
gently
through
the
woods
whose
dead
leaves
were
so
wet
that
no
rustle
was
made
i
chanced
to
pass
under
the
old
nest
and
was
surprised
to
see
a
black
tail
sticking
over
the
edge
i
struck
the
tree
a
smart
blow
off
flew
a
crow
and
the
secret
was
out
i
had
long
suspected
that
a
pair
of
crows
nested
each
year
about
the
pines
but
now
i
realized
that
it
was
silverspot
and
his
wife
the
old
nest
was
theirs
and
they
were
too
wise
to
give
it
an
air
of
and
housekeeping
each
year
here
they
had
nested
for
long
though
guns
in
the
hands
of
men
and
boys
hungry
to
shoot
crows
were
carried
under
their
home
every
day
i
never
surprised
the
old
fellow
again
though
i
several
times
saw
him
through
my
telescope
one
day
while
watching
i
saw
a
crow
crossing
the
don
valley
with
something
white
in
his
beak
he
flew
to
the
mouth
of
the
rosedale
brook
then
took
a
short
flight
to
the
beaver
elm
there
he
dropped
the
white
object
and
looking
about
gave
me
a
chance
to
recognize
my
old
friend
silverspot
after
a
minute
he
picked
up
the
white
thing
a
shell
and
walked
over
past
the
spring
and
here
among
the
docks
and
the
he
unearthed
a
pile
of
shells
and
other
white
shiny
things
he
spread
them
out
in
the
sun
turned
them
over
turned
them
one
by
one
in
his
beak
dropped
them
nestled
on
them
as
though
they
were
eggs
toyed
with
them
and
gloated
over
them
like
a
miser
this
was
his
hobby
his
weakness
he
could
not
have
explained
why
he
enjoyed
them
any
more
than
a
boy
can
explain
why
he
collects
or
a
girl
why
she
prefers
pearls
to
rubies
but
his
pleasure
in
them
was
very
real
and
after
half
an
hour
he
covered
them
all
including
the
new
one
with
earth
and
leaves
and
flew
off
i
went
at
once
to
the
spot
and
examined
the
hoard
there
was
about
a
hatfull
in
all
chiefly
white
pebbles
and
some
bits
of
tin
but
there
was
also
the
handle
of
a
china
cup
which
must
have
been
the
gem
of
the
collection
that
was
the
last
time
i
saw
them
silverspot
knew
that
i
had
found
his
treasures
and
he
removed
them
at
once
where
i
never
knew
during
the
space
that
i
watched
him
so
closely
he
had
many
little
adventures
and
escapes
he
was
once
severely
handled
by
a
sparrowhawk
and
often
he
was
chased
and
worried
by
kingbirds
not
that
these
did
him
much
harm
but
they
were
such
noisy
pests
that
he
avoided
their
company
as
quickly
as
possible
just
as
a
grown
man
avoids
a
conflict
with
a
noisy
and
impudent
small
boy
he
had
some
cruel
tricks
too
he
had
a
way
of
going
the
round
of
the
small
birds
nests
each
morning
to
eat
the
new
laid
eggs
as
regularly
as
a
doctor
visiting
his
patients
but
we
must
not
judge
him
for
that
as
it
is
just
what
we
ourselves
do
to
the
hens
in
the
barnyard
his
quickness
of
wit
was
often
shown
one
day
i
saw
him
flying
down
the
ravine
with
a
large
piece
of
bread
in
his
bill
the
stream
below
him
was
at
this
time
being
bricked
over
as
a
sewer
there
was
one
part
of
two
hundred
yards
quite
finished
and
as
he
flew
over
the
open
water
just
above
this
the
bread
fell
from
his
bill
and
was
swept
by
the
current
out
of
sight
into
the
tunnel
he
flew
down
and
peered
vainly
into
the
dark
cavern
then
acting
upon
a
happy
thought
he
flew
to
the
downstream
end
of
the
tunnel
and
awaiting
the
reappearance
of
the
floating
bread
as
it
was
swept
onward
by
the
current
he
seized
and
bore
it
off
in
triumph
silverspot
was
a
crow
of
the
world
he
was
truly
a
successful
crow
he
lived
in
a
region
that
though
full
of
dangers
abounded
with
food
in
the
old
unrepaired
nest
he
raised
a
brood
each
year
with
his
wife
whom
by
the
way
i
never
could
distinguish
and
when
the
crows
again
gathered
together
he
was
their
acknowledged
chief
the
reassembling
takes
place
about
the
end
of
june
the
young
crows
with
their
soft
wings
and
falsetto
voices
are
brought
by
their
parents
whom
they
nearly
equal
in
size
and
introduced
to
society
at
the
old
pine
woods
a
woods
that
is
at
once
their
fortress
and
college
here
they
find
security
in
numbers
and
in
lofty
yet
sheltered
perches
and
here
they
begin
their
schooling
and
are
taught
all
the
secrets
of
success
in
crow
life
and
in
crow
life
the
least
failure
does
not
simply
mean
begin
again
it
means
death
the
first
week
or
two
after
their
arrival
is
spent
by
the
young
ones
in
getting
acquainted
for
each
crow
must
know
personally
all
the
others
in
the
band
their
parents
meanwhile
have
time
to
rest
a
little
after
the
work
of
raising
them
for
now
the
youngsters
are
able
to
feed
themselves
and
roost
on
a
branch
in
a
row
just
like
big
folks
in
a
week
or
two
the
moulting
season
comes
at
this
time
the
old
crows
are
usually
irritable
and
nervous
but
it
does
not
stop
them
from
beginning
to
drill
the
youngsters
who
of
course
do
not
much
enjoy
the
punishment
and
nagging
they
get
so
soon
after
they
have
been
mamma
own
darlings
but
it
is
all
for
their
good
as
the
old
lady
said
when
she
skinned
the
eels
and
old
silverspot
is
an
excellent
teacher
sometimes
he
seems
to
make
a
speech
to
them
what
he
says
i
can
not
guess
but
judging
by
the
way
they
receive
it
it
must
be
extremely
witty
each
morning
there
is
a
company
drill
for
the
young
ones
naturally
drop
into
two
or
three
squads
according
to
their
age
and
strength
the
rest
of
the
day
they
forage
with
their
parents
when
at
length
september
comes
we
find
a
great
change
the
rabble
of
silly
little
crows
have
begun
to
learn
sense
the
delicate
blue
iris
of
their
eyes
the
sign
of
a
has
given
place
to
the
dark
brown
eye
of
the
old
stager
they
know
their
drill
now
and
have
learned
sentry
duty
they
have
been
taught
guns
and
traps
and
taken
a
special
course
in
wireworms
and
they
know
that
a
fat
old
farmer
wife
is
much
less
dangerous
though
so
much
larger
than
her
son
and
they
can
tell
the
boy
from
his
sister
they
know
that
an
umbrella
is
not
a
gun
and
they
can
count
up
to
six
which
is
fair
for
young
crows
though
silverspot
can
go
up
nearly
to
thirty
they
know
the
smell
of
gunpowder
and
the
south
side
of
a
and
begin
to
plume
themselves
upon
being
crows
of
the
world
they
always
fold
their
wings
three
times
after
alighting
to
be
sure
that
it
is
neatly
done
they
know
how
to
worry
a
fox
into
giving
up
half
his
dinner
and
also
that
when
the
kingbird
or
the
purple
martin
assails
them
they
must
dash
into
a
bush
for
it
is
as
impossible
to
fight
the
little
pests
as
it
is
for
the
fat
to
catch
the
small
boys
who
have
raided
her
basket
all
these
things
do
the
young
crows
know
but
they
have
taken
no
lessons
in
yet
for
it
is
not
the
season
they
are
unacquainted
with
clams
and
have
never
tasted
horses
eyes
or
seen
sprouted
corn
and
they
do
know
a
thing
about
travel
the
greatest
educator
of
all
they
did
not
think
of
that
two
months
ago
and
since
then
they
have
thought
of
it
but
have
learned
to
wait
till
their
betters
are
ready
september
sees
a
great
change
in
the
old
crows
too
their
moulting
is
over
they
are
now
in
full
feather
again
and
proud
of
their
handsome
coats
their
health
is
again
good
and
with
it
their
tempers
are
improved
even
old
silverspot
the
strict
teacher
becomes
quite
jolly
and
the
youngsters
who
have
long
ago
learned
to
respect
him
begin
really
to
love
him
he
has
hammered
away
at
drill
teaching
them
all
the
signals
and
words
of
command
in
use
and
now
it
is
a
pleasure
to
see
them
in
the
early
morning
i
the
old
chieftain
would
cry
in
crow
and
company
i
would
answer
with
a
great
clamor
and
himself
leading
them
they
would
all
fly
straight
forward
and
straight
upward
they
turned
in
a
moment
and
they
all
massed
into
a
dense
black
flock
and
they
spread
out
like
leaves
before
the
wind
line
and
they
strung
out
into
the
long
line
of
ordinary
flight
and
they
all
dropped
nearly
to
the
ground
and
they
alighted
and
scattered
about
to
feed
while
two
of
the
permanent
sentries
mounted
duty
one
on
a
tree
to
the
right
the
other
on
a
mound
to
the
far
left
a
minute
or
two
later
silverspot
would
cry
out
man
with
a
gun
the
sentries
repeated
the
cry
and
the
company
flew
at
once
in
open
order
as
quickly
as
possible
toward
the
trees
once
behind
these
they
formed
line
again
in
safety
and
returned
to
the
home
pines
sentry
duty
is
not
taken
in
turn
by
all
the
crows
but
a
certain
number
whose
watchfulness
has
been
often
proved
are
the
perpetual
sentries
and
are
expected
to
watch
and
forage
at
the
same
time
rather
hard
on
them
it
seems
to
us
but
it
works
well
and
the
crow
organization
is
admitted
by
all
birds
to
be
the
very
best
in
existence
finally
each
november
sees
the
troop
sail
away
southward
to
learn
new
modes
of
life
new
landmarks
and
new
kinds
of
food
under
the
guidance
of
the
everwise
silverspot
iii
there
is
only
one
time
when
a
crow
is
a
fool
and
that
is
at
night
there
is
only
one
bird
that
terrifies
the
crow
and
that
is
the
owl
when
therefore
these
come
together
it
is
a
woeful
thing
for
the
sable
birds
the
distant
hoot
of
an
owl
after
dark
is
enough
to
make
them
withdraw
their
heads
from
under
their
wings
and
sit
trembling
and
miserable
till
morning
in
very
cold
weather
the
exposure
of
their
faces
thus
has
often
resulted
in
a
crow
having
one
or
both
of
his
eyes
frozen
so
that
blindness
followed
and
therefore
death
there
are
no
hospitals
for
sick
crows
but
with
the
morning
their
courage
comes
again
and
arousing
themselves
they
ransack
the
woods
for
a
mile
around
till
they
find
that
owl
and
if
they
do
not
kill
him
they
at
least
worry
him
half
to
death
and
drive
him
twenty
miles
away
in
the
crows
had
come
as
usual
to
castle
frank
i
was
walking
in
these
woods
a
few
days
afterward
when
i
chanced
upon
the
track
of
a
rabbit
that
had
been
running
at
full
speed
over
the
snow
and
dodging
about
among
the
trees
as
though
pursued
strange
to
tell
i
could
see
no
track
of
the
pursuer
i
followed
the
trail
and
presently
saw
a
drop
of
blood
on
the
snow
and
a
little
farther
on
found
the
partly
devoured
remains
of
a
little
brown
bunny
what
had
killed
him
was
a
mystery
until
a
careful
search
showed
in
the
snow
a
great
track
and
a
beautifully
pencilled
brown
feather
then
all
was
clear
a
horned
owl
half
an
hour
later
in
passing
again
by
the
place
there
in
a
tree
within
ten
feet
of
the
bones
of
his
victim
was
the
owl
himself
the
murderer
still
hung
about
the
scene
of
his
crime
for
once
circumstantial
evidence
had
not
lied
at
my
approach
he
gave
a
guttural
and
flew
off
with
low
flagging
flight
to
haunt
the
distant
sombre
woods
two
days
afterward
at
dawn
there
was
a
great
uproar
among
the
crows
i
went
out
early
to
see
and
found
some
black
feathers
drifting
over
the
snow
i
followed
up
the
wind
in
the
direction
from
which
they
came
and
soon
saw
the
bloody
remains
of
a
crow
and
the
great
track
which
again
told
me
that
the
murderer
was
the
owl
all
around
were
signs
of
the
struggle
but
the
fell
destroyer
was
too
strong
the
poor
crow
had
been
dragged
from
his
perch
at
night
when
the
darkness
bad
put
him
at
a
hopeless
disadvantage
i
turned
over
the
remains
and
by
chance
unburied
the
head
then
started
with
an
exclamation
of
sorrow
alas
it
was
the
head
of
old
silverspot
his
long
life
of
usefulness
to
his
tribe
was
over
slain
at
last
by
the
owl
that
he
had
taught
so
many
hundreds
of
young
crows
to
beware
of
the
old
nest
on
the
sugar
loaf
is
abandoned
now
the
crows
still
come
in
to
castle
frank
but
without
their
famous
leader
their
numbers
are
dwindling
and
soon
they
will
be
seen
no
more
about
the
old
in
which
they
and
their
forefathers
had
lived
and
learned
for
ages
raggylug
the
story
of
a
cottontail
rabbit
raggylug
or
rag
was
the
name
of
a
young
cottontail
rabbit
it
was
given
him
from
his
torn
and
ragged
ear
a
that
he
got
in
his
first
adventure
he
lived
with
his
mother
in
olifant
swamp
where
i
made
their
acquaintance
and
gathered
in
a
hundred
different
ways
the
little
bits
of
proof
and
scraps
of
truth
that
at
length
enabled
me
to
write
this
history
those
who
do
not
know
the
animals
well
may
think
i
have
humanized
them
but
those
who
have
lived
so
near
them
as
to
know
somewhat
of
their
ways
and
their
minds
will
not
think
so
truly
rabbits
have
no
speech
as
we
understand
it
but
they
have
a
way
of
conveying
ideas
by
a
system
of
sounds
signs
scents
movements
and
example
that
answers
the
purpose
of
speech
and
it
must
be
remembered
that
though
in
telling
this
story
i
freely
translate
from
rabbit
into
english
i
repeat
nothing
that
they
did
not
say
i
the
rank
swamp
grass
bent
over
and
concealed
the
snug
nest
where
raggylug
mother
had
hidden
him
she
had
partly
covered
him
with
some
of
the
bedding
and
as
always
her
last
warning
was
to
lie
low
and
say
nothing
whatever
happens
though
tucked
in
bed
he
was
wide
awake
and
his
bright
eyes
were
taking
in
that
part
of
his
little
green
world
that
was
straight
above
a
bluejay
and
a
two
notorious
thieves
were
loudly
berating
each
other
for
stealing
and
at
one
time
home
bush
was
the
centre
of
their
fight
a
yellow
warbler
caught
a
blue
butterfly
but
six
inches
from
his
nose
and
a
scarlet
and
black
ladybug
serenely
waving
her
knobbed
feelers
took
a
long
walk
up
one
down
another
and
across
the
nest
and
over
rag
face
and
yet
he
never
moved
nor
even
winked
after
a
while
he
heard
a
strange
rustling
of
the
leaves
in
the
near
thicket
it
was
an
odd
continuous
sound
and
though
it
went
this
way
and
that
way
and
came
ever
nearer
there
was
no
patter
of
feet
with
it
rag
had
lived
his
whole
life
in
the
swamp
he
was
three
weeks
old
and
yet
had
never
heard
anything
like
this
of
course
his
curiosity
was
greatly
aroused
his
mother
had
cautioned
him
to
lie
low
but
that
was
understood
to
be
in
case
of
danger
and
this
strange
sound
without
footfalls
could
not
be
anything
to
fear
the
low
rasping
went
past
close
at
hand
then
to
the
right
then
back
and
seemed
going
away
rag
felt
he
knew
what
he
was
about
he
a
baby
it
was
his
duty
to
learn
what
it
was
he
slowly
raised
his
rolypoly
body
on
his
short
fluffy
legs
lifted
his
little
round
head
above
the
covering
of
his
nest
and
peeped
out
into
the
woods
the
sound
had
ceased
as
soon
as
he
moved
he
saw
nothing
so
took
one
step
forward
to
a
clear
view
and
instantly
found
himself
face
to
face
with
an
enormous
black
serpent
mammy
he
screamed
in
mortal
terror
as
the
monster
darted
at
him
with
all
the
strength
of
his
tiny
limbs
he
tried
to
run
but
in
a
flash
the
snake
had
him
by
one
ear
and
whipped
around
him
with
his
coils
to
gloat
over
the
helpless
little
baby
bunny
he
had
secured
for
dinner
gasped
poor
little
raggylug
as
the
cruel
monster
began
slowly
choking
him
to
death
very
soon
the
little
one
cry
would
have
ceased
but
bounding
through
the
woods
straight
as
an
arrow
came
mammy
no
longer
a
shy
helpless
little
molly
cottontail
ready
to
fly
from
a
shadow
the
mother
love
was
strong
in
her
the
cry
of
her
baby
had
filled
her
with
the
courage
of
a
hero
and
hop
she
went
over
that
horrible
reptile
whack
she
struck
down
at
him
with
her
sharp
hind
claws
as
she
passed
giving
him
such
a
stinging
blow
that
he
squirmed
with
pain
and
hissed
with
anger
came
feebly
from
the
little
one
and
mammy
came
leaping
again
and
again
and
struck
harder
and
fiercer
until
the
loathsome
reptile
let
go
the
little
one
ear
and
tried
to
bite
the
old
one
as
she
leaped
over
but
all
he
got
was
a
mouthful
of
wool
each
time
and
molly
fierce
blows
began
to
tell
as
long
bloody
rips
were
torn
in
the
black
snake
scaly
armor
things
were
now
looking
bad
for
the
snake
and
bracing
himself
for
the
next
charge
he
lost
his
tight
hold
on
baby
bunny
who
at
once
wriggled
out
of
the
coils
and
away
into
the
underbrush
breathless
and
terribly
frightened
but
unhurt
save
that
his
left
ear
was
much
torn
by
the
teeth
of
that
dreadful
serpent
molly
now
had
gained
all
she
wanted
she
had
no
notion
of
fighting
for
glory
or
revenge
away
she
went
into
the
woods
and
the
little
one
followed
the
shining
beacon
of
her
tail
until
she
led
him
to
a
safe
corner
of
the
swamp
ii
old
olifant
swamp
was
a
rough
brambly
tract
of
woods
with
a
marshy
pond
and
a
stream
through
the
middle
a
few
ragged
remnants
of
the
old
forest
still
stood
in
it
and
a
few
of
the
still
older
trunks
were
lying
about
as
dead
logs
in
the
brushwood
the
land
about
the
pond
was
of
that
sedgy
kind
that
cats
and
horses
avoid
but
that
cattle
do
not
fear
the
drier
zones
were
overgrown
with
briars
and
young
trees
the
outermost
belt
of
all
that
next
the
fields
was
of
thrifty
young
pines
whose
living
needles
in
air
and
dead
ones
on
earth
offer
so
delicious
an
odor
to
the
nostrils
of
the
and
so
deadly
a
breath
to
those
seedlings
that
would
compete
with
them
for
the
worthless
waste
they
grow
on
all
around
for
a
long
way
were
smooth
fields
and
the
only
wild
tracks
that
ever
crossed
these
fields
were
those
of
a
thoroughly
bad
and
unscrupulous
fox
that
lived
only
too
near
the
chief
indwellers
of
the
swamp
were
molly
and
rag
their
nearest
neighbors
were
far
away
and
their
nearest
kin
were
dead
this
was
their
home
and
here
they
lived
together
and
here
rag
received
the
training
that
made
his
success
in
life
molly
was
a
good
little
mother
and
gave
him
a
careful
bringing
up
the
first
thing
he
learned
was
to
lie
low
and
say
nothing
his
adventure
with
the
snake
taught
him
the
wisdom
of
this
rag
never
forgot
that
lesson
afterward
he
did
as
he
was
told
and
it
made
the
other
things
come
more
easily
the
second
lesson
he
learned
was
it
grows
out
of
the
first
and
rag
was
taught
it
as
soon
as
he
could
run
is
simply
doing
nothing
turning
into
a
statue
as
soon
as
he
finds
a
foe
near
no
matter
what
he
is
doing
a
cottontail
keeps
just
as
he
is
and
stops
all
movement
for
the
creatures
of
the
woods
are
of
the
same
color
as
the
things
in
the
woods
and
catch
the
eye
only
while
moving
so
when
enemies
chance
together
the
one
who
first
sees
the
other
can
keep
himself
unseen
by
and
thus
have
all
the
advantage
of
choosing
the
time
for
attack
or
escape
only
those
who
live
in
the
woods
know
the
importance
of
this
every
wild
creature
and
every
hunter
must
learn
it
all
learn
to
do
it
well
but
not
one
of
them
can
beat
molly
cottontail
in
the
doing
rag
mother
taught
him
this
trick
by
example
when
the
white
cotton
cushion
that
she
always
carried
to
sit
on
went
bobbing
away
through
the
woods
of
course
rag
ran
his
hardest
to
keep
up
but
when
molly
stopped
and
the
natural
wish
to
copy
made
him
do
the
same
but
the
best
lesson
of
all
that
rag
learned
from
his
mother
was
the
secret
of
the
brierbrush
it
is
a
very
old
secret
now
and
to
make
it
plain
you
must
first
hear
why
the
brierbrush
quarrelled
with
the
beasts
long
ago
the
roses
used
to
grow
on
bushes
that
had
no
thorns
but
the
squirrels
and
mice
used
to
climb
after
them
the
cattle
used
to
knock
them
off
with
their
horns
the
possum
would
twitch
them
off
with
his
long
tail
and
the
deer
with
his
sharp
hoofs
would
break
them
down
so
the
brierbrush
armed
itself
with
spikes
to
protect
its
roses
and
declared
eternal
war
on
all
creatures
that
climbed
trees
or
had
horns
or
hoofs
or
long
tails
this
left
the
brierbrush
at
peace
with
none
but
molly
cottontail
who
could
not
climb
was
hornless
hoofless
and
had
scarcely
any
tail
at
all
in
truth
the
cottontail
had
never
harmed
a
brierrose
and
having
now
so
many
enemies
the
rose
took
the
rabbit
into
especial
friendship
and
when
dangers
are
threatening
poor
bunny
he
flies
to
the
nearest
brierbrush
certain
that
it
is
ready
with
a
million
keen
and
poisoned
daggers
to
defend
him
so
the
secret
that
rag
learned
from
his
mother
was
the
brierbrush
is
your
best
friend
much
of
the
time
that
season
was
spent
in
learning
the
lay
of
the
land
and
the
bramble
and
brier
mazes
and
rag
learned
them
so
well
that
he
could
go
all
around
the
swamp
by
two
different
ways
and
never
leave
the
friendly
briers
at
any
place
for
more
than
five
hops
it
is
not
long
since
the
foes
of
the
cottontails
were
disgusted
to
find
that
man
had
brought
a
new
kind
of
bramble
and
planted
it
in
long
lines
throughout
the
country
it
was
so
strong
that
no
creatures
could
break
it
down
and
so
sharp
that
the
toughest
skin
was
torn
by
it
each
year
there
was
more
of
it
and
each
year
it
became
a
more
serious
matter
to
the
wild
creatures
but
molly
cottontail
had
no
fear
of
it
she
was
not
brought
up
in
the
briers
for
nothing
dogs
and
foxes
cattle
and
sheep
and
even
man
himself
might
be
torn
by
those
fearful
spikes
but
molly
understands
it
and
lives
and
thrives
under
it
and
the
further
it
spreads
the
more
safe
country
there
is
for
the
cottontail
and
the
name
of
this
new
and
dreaded
bramble
is
the
fence
iii
molly
had
no
other
children
to
look
after
now
so
rag
had
all
her
care
he
was
unusually
quick
and
bright
as
well
as
strong
and
he
had
uncommonly
good
chances
so
he
got
on
remarkably
well
all
the
season
she
kept
him
busy
learning
the
tricks
of
the
trail
and
what
to
eat
and
drink
and
what
not
to
touch
day
by
day
she
worked
to
train
him
little
by
little
she
taught
him
putting
into
his
mind
hundreds
of
ideas
that
her
own
life
or
early
training
had
stored
in
hers
and
so
equipped
him
with
the
knowledge
that
makes
life
possible
to
their
kind
close
by
her
side
in
the
or
the
thicket
he
would
sit
and
copy
her
when
she
wobbled
her
nose
keep
her
smeller
clear
and
pull
the
bite
from
her
mouth
or
taste
her
lips
to
make
sure
he
was
getting
the
same
kind
of
fodder
still
copying
her
he
learned
to
comb
his
ears
with
his
claws
and
to
dress
his
coat
and
to
bite
the
burrs
out
of
his
vest
and
socks
he
learned
too
that
nothing
but
clear
dewdrops
from
the
briers
were
fit
for
a
rabbit
to
drink
as
water
which
has
once
touched
the
earth
must
surely
bear
some
taint
thus
he
began
the
study
of
woodcraft
the
oldest
of
all
sciences
as
soon
as
rag
was
big
enough
to
go
out
alone
his
mother
taught
him
the
signal
code
rabbits
telegraph
each
other
by
thumping
on
the
ground
with
their
hind
feet
along
the
ground
sound
carries
far
a
thump
that
at
six
feet
from
the
earth
is
not
heard
at
twenty
yards
will
near
the
ground
be
heard
at
least
one
hundred
yards
rabbits
have
very
keen
hearing
and
so
might
hear
this
same
thump
at
two
hundred
yards
and
that
would
reach
from
end
to
end
of
olifant
swamp
a
single
thump
means
or
a
slow
thump
thump
means
a
fast
thump
thump
means
and
a
very
fast
thump
thump
thump
means
for
dear
life
at
another
time
when
the
weather
was
fine
and
the
bluejays
were
quarrelling
among
themselves
a
sure
sign
that
no
dangerous
foe
was
about
rag
began
a
new
study
molly
by
flattening
her
ears
gave
the
sign
to
squat
then
she
ran
far
away
in
the
thicket
and
gave
the
thumping
signal
for
rag
set
out
at
a
run
to
the
place
but
could
not
find
molly
he
thumped
but
got
no
reply
setting
carefully
about
his
search
he
found
her
and
following
this
strange
guide
that
the
beasts
all
know
so
well
and
man
does
not
know
at
all
he
worked
out
the
trail
and
found
her
where
she
was
hidden
thus
he
got
his
first
lesson
in
trailing
and
thus
it
was
that
the
games
of
hide
and
seek
they
played
became
the
schooling
for
the
serious
chase
of
which
there
was
so
much
in
his
after
life
before
that
first
season
of
schooling
was
over
he
had
learnt
all
the
principal
tricks
by
which
a
rabbit
lives
and
in
not
a
few
problems
showed
himself
a
veritable
genius
he
was
an
adept
at
and
he
could
play
with
and
with
so
well
that
he
scarcely
needed
any
other
tricks
he
had
not
yet
tried
it
but
he
knew
just
how
to
play
which
is
a
new
trick
of
the
brilliant
order
he
had
made
a
special
study
of
which
burns
up
all
scent
and
was
deeply
versed
in
and
as
well
as
which
is
a
trick
requiring
longer
notice
and
yet
he
never
forgot
that
is
the
beginning
of
all
wisdom
and
the
only
trick
that
is
always
safe
he
was
taught
the
signs
by
which
to
know
all
his
foes
and
then
the
way
to
baffle
them
for
hawks
owls
foxes
hounds
curs
minks
weasels
cats
skunks
coons
and
men
each
have
a
different
plan
of
pursuit
and
for
each
and
all
of
these
evils
he
was
taught
a
remedy
and
for
knowledge
of
the
enemy
approach
he
learnt
to
depend
first
on
himself
and
his
mother
and
then
on
the
bluejay
never
neglect
the
bluejay
warning
said
molly
he
is
a
a
marplot
and
a
thief
all
the
time
but
nothing
escapes
him
he
would
mind
harming
us
but
he
can
not
thanks
to
the
briers
and
his
enemies
are
ours
so
it
is
well
to
heed
him
if
the
woodpecker
cries
a
warning
you
can
trust
him
he
is
honest
but
he
is
a
fool
beside
the
bluejay
and
though
the
bluejay
often
tells
lies
for
mischief
you
are
safe
to
believe
him
when
he
brings
ill
news
the
trick
takes
a
deal
of
nerve
and
the
best
of
legs
it
was
long
before
rag
ventured
to
play
it
but
as
he
came
to
his
full
powers
it
became
one
of
his
favorites
it
fine
play
for
those
who
can
do
it
said
molly
first
you
lead
off
your
dog
on
a
straightaway
and
warm
him
up
a
bit
by
nearly
letting
him
catch
you
then
keeping
just
one
hop
ahead
you
lead
him
at
a
long
slant
full
tilt
into
a
i
seen
many
a
dog
and
fox
crippled
and
one
big
hound
killed
outright
this
way
but
i
also
seen
more
than
one
rabbit
lose
his
life
in
trying
it
rag
early
learnt
what
some
rabbits
never
learn
at
all
that
is
not
such
a
fine
ruse
as
it
seems
it
may
be
the
certain
safety
of
a
wise
rabbit
but
soon
or
late
is
a
sure
to
a
fool
a
young
rabbit
always
thinks
of
it
first
an
old
rabbit
never
tries
it
till
all
others
fail
it
means
escape
from
a
man
or
dog
a
fox
or
a
bird
of
prey
but
it
means
sudden
death
if
the
foe
is
a
ferret
mink
skunk
or
weasel
there
were
but
two
in
the
swamp
one
on
the
sunning
bank
which
was
a
dry
sheltered
knoll
in
the
it
was
open
and
sloping
to
the
sun
and
here
on
fine
days
the
cottontails
took
their
they
stretched
out
among
the
fragrant
pine
needles
and
in
odd
positions
and
turned
slowly
over
as
though
roasting
and
wishing
all
sides
well
done
and
they
blinked
and
panted
and
squirmed
as
if
in
dreadful
pain
yet
this
was
one
of
the
keenest
enjoyments
they
knew
just
over
the
brow
of
the
knoll
was
a
large
pine
stump
its
grotesque
roots
wriggled
out
above
the
yellow
like
dragons
and
under
their
protecting
claws
a
sulky
old
woodchuck
had
digged
a
den
long
ago
he
became
more
sour
and
as
weeks
went
by
and
one
day
waited
to
quarrel
with
olifant
dog
instead
of
going
in
so
that
molly
cottontail
was
able
to
take
possession
of
the
den
an
hour
later
this
the
hole
was
afterward
very
coolly
taken
by
a
young
skunk
who
with
less
valor
might
have
enjoyed
greater
longevity
for
he
imagined
that
even
man
with
a
gun
would
fly
from
him
instead
of
keeping
molly
from
the
den
for
good
therefore
his
reign
like
that
of
a
certain
hebrew
king
was
over
in
seven
days
the
other
the
was
in
a
fern
thicket
next
the
clover
field
it
was
small
and
damp
and
useless
except
as
a
last
retreat
it
also
was
the
work
of
a
woodchuck
a
friendly
neighbor
but
a
harebrained
youngster
whose
skin
in
the
form
of
a
whiplash
was
now
developing
higher
in
the
olifant
working
team
simple
justice
said
the
old
man
for
that
hide
was
raised
on
stolen
feed
that
the
team
would
a
turned
into
anyway
the
cottontails
were
now
sole
owners
of
the
holes
and
did
not
go
near
them
when
they
could
help
it
lest
anything
like
a
path
should
be
made
that
might
betray
these
last
retreats
to
an
enemy
there
was
also
the
hollow
hickory
which
though
nearly
fallen
was
still
green
and
had
the
great
advantage
of
being
open
at
both
ends
this
had
long
been
the
residence
of
one
lotor
a
solitary
old
coon
whose
ostensible
calling
was
and
who
like
the
monks
of
old
was
supposed
to
abstain
from
all
flesh
food
but
it
was
shrewdly
suspected
that
he
needed
but
a
chance
to
indulge
in
a
diet
of
rabbit
when
at
last
one
dark
night
he
was
killed
while
raiding
olifant
henhouse
molly
so
far
from
feeling
a
pang
of
regret
took
possession
of
his
cosy
nest
with
a
sense
of
unbounded
relief
iv
bright
august
sunlight
was
flooding
the
swamp
in
the
morning
everything
seemed
soaking
in
the
warm
radiance
a
little
brown
was
teetering
on
a
long
rush
in
the
pond
beneath
him
there
were
open
spaces
of
dirty
water
that
brought
down
a
few
scraps
of
the
blue
sky
and
worked
it
and
the
yellow
into
an
exquisite
mosaic
with
a
little
picture
of
the
bird
in
the
middle
on
the
bank
behind
was
a
great
vigorous
growth
of
golden
green
that
cast
dense
shadow
over
the
brown
swamp
tussocks
the
eyes
of
the
were
not
trained
to
take
in
the
color
glories
but
he
saw
what
we
might
have
missed
that
two
of
the
numberless
leafy
brown
bumps
under
the
broad
were
furry
living
things
with
noses
that
never
ceased
to
move
up
and
down
whatever
else
was
still
it
was
molly
and
rag
they
were
stretched
under
the
not
because
they
liked
its
rank
smell
but
because
the
winged
ticks
could
not
stand
it
at
all
and
so
left
them
in
peace
rabbits
have
no
set
time
for
lessons
they
are
always
learning
but
what
the
lesson
is
depends
on
the
present
stress
and
that
must
arrive
before
it
is
known
they
went
to
this
place
for
a
quiet
rest
but
had
not
been
long
there
when
suddenly
a
warning
note
from
the
bluejay
caused
molly
nose
and
ears
to
go
up
and
her
tail
to
tighten
to
her
back
away
across
the
swamp
was
olifant
big
black
and
white
dog
coming
straight
toward
them
now
said
molly
squat
while
i
go
and
keep
that
fool
out
of
mischief
away
she
went
to
meet
him
and
she
fearlessly
dashed
across
the
dog
path
he
fairly
yelled
as
he
bounded
after
molly
but
she
kept
just
beyond
his
reach
and
led
him
where
the
million
daggers
struck
fast
and
deep
till
his
tender
ears
were
scratched
raw
and
guided
him
at
last
plump
into
a
hidden
fence
where
he
got
such
a
gashing
that
he
went
homeward
howling
with
pain
after
making
a
short
double
a
loop
and
a
baulk
in
case
the
dog
should
come
back
molly
returned
to
find
that
rag
in
his
eagerness
was
standing
bolt
upright
and
craning
his
neck
to
see
the
sport
this
disobedience
made
her
so
angry
that
she
struck
him
with
her
hind
foot
and
knocked
him
over
in
the
mud
one
day
as
they
fed
on
the
near
clover
field
a
hawk
came
swooping
after
them
molly
kicked
up
her
hind
legs
to
make
fun
of
him
and
skipped
into
the
briers
along
one
of
their
old
pathways
where
of
course
the
hawk
could
not
follow
it
was
the
main
path
from
the
creekside
thicket
to
the
brushpile
several
creepers
had
grown
across
it
and
molly
keeping
one
eye
on
the
hawk
set
to
work
and
cut
the
creepers
off
rag
watched
her
then
ran
on
ahead
and
cut
some
more
that
were
across
the
path
that
right
said
molly
always
keep
the
runways
clear
you
will
need
them
often
enough
not
wide
but
clear
cut
everything
like
a
creeper
across
them
and
some
day
you
will
find
you
have
cut
a
snare
a
what
asked
rag
as
he
scratched
his
right
ear
with
his
left
hind
foot
a
snare
is
something
that
looks
like
a
creeper
but
it
does
grow
and
it
worse
than
all
the
hawks
in
the
world
said
molly
glancing
at
the
now
for
there
it
hides
night
and
day
in
the
runway
till
the
chance
to
catch
you
comes
i
do
believe
it
could
catch
me
said
rag
with
the
pride
of
youth
as
he
rose
on
his
heels
to
rub
his
chin
and
whiskers
high
up
on
a
smooth
sapling
rag
did
not
know
he
was
doing
this
but
his
mother
saw
and
knew
it
was
a
sign
like
the
changing
of
a
boy
voice
that
her
little
one
was
no
longer
a
baby
but
would
soon
be
a
cottontail
v
there
is
magic
in
running
water
who
does
not
know
it
and
feel
it
the
railroad
builder
fearlessly
throws
his
bank
across
the
wide
bog
or
lake
or
the
sea
itself
but
the
tiniest
ril
of
running
water
he
treats
with
great
respect
studies
its
wish
and
its
way
and
gives
it
all
it
seems
to
ask
the
traveller
in
the
poisonous
alkali
deserts
holds
back
in
deadly
fear
from
the
sedgy
ponds
till
he
finds
one
down
whose
centre
is
a
thin
clear
line
and
a
faint
flow
the
sign
of
running
living
water
and
joyfully
he
drinks
there
is
magic
in
running
water
no
evil
spell
can
cross
it
tam
proved
its
potency
in
time
of
sorest
need
the
creature
with
its
deadly
foe
following
tireless
on
the
trail
scent
realizes
its
nearing
doom
and
feels
an
awful
spell
its
strength
is
spent
its
every
trick
is
tried
in
vain
till
the
good
angel
leads
it
to
the
water
the
running
living
water
and
dashing
in
it
follows
the
cooling
stream
and
then
with
force
renewed
takes
to
the
woods
again
there
is
magic
in
running
water
the
hounds
come
to
the
very
spot
and
halt
and
cast
about
and
halt
and
cast
in
vain
their
spell
is
broken
by
the
merry
stream
and
the
wild
thing
lives
its
life
and
this
was
one
of
the
great
secrets
that
raggylug
learned
from
his
mother
after
the
brierrose
the
water
is
your
friend
one
hot
muggy
night
in
august
molly
led
rag
through
the
woods
the
cushion
she
wore
under
her
tail
twinkled
ahead
and
was
his
guiding
lantern
though
it
went
out
as
soon
as
she
stopped
and
sat
on
it
after
a
few
runs
and
stops
to
listen
they
came
to
the
edge
of
the
pond
the
hylas
in
the
trees
above
them
were
singing
sleep
and
away
out
on
a
sunken
log
in
the
deep
water
up
to
his
chin
in
the
cooling
bath
a
bloated
bullfrog
was
singing
the
praises
of
a
rum
follow
me
still
said
molly
in
rabbit
and
she
went
into
the
pond
and
struck
out
for
the
sunken
log
in
the
middle
rag
flinched
but
plunged
with
a
little
gasping
and
wobbling
his
nose
very
fast
but
still
copying
his
mother
the
same
movements
as
on
land
sent
him
through
the
water
and
thus
he
found
he
could
swim
on
he
went
till
he
reached
the
sunken
log
and
scrambled
up
by
his
dripping
mother
on
the
high
dry
end
with
a
rushy
screen
around
them
and
the
water
that
tells
no
tales
after
this
on
warm
black
nights
when
that
old
fox
from
springfield
came
prowling
through
the
swamp
rag
would
note
the
place
of
the
bullfrog
voice
for
in
case
of
direst
need
it
might
be
a
guide
to
safety
and
thenceforth
the
words
of
the
song
that
the
bullfrog
sang
were
come
in
danger
come
this
was
the
latest
study
that
rag
took
up
with
his
mother
it
was
really
a
course
for
many
little
rabbits
never
learn
it
at
all
vi
no
wild
animal
dies
of
old
age
its
life
has
soon
or
late
a
tragic
end
it
is
only
a
question
of
how
long
it
can
hold
out
against
its
foes
but
rag
life
was
proof
that
once
a
rabbit
passes
out
of
his
youth
he
is
likely
to
outlive
his
prime
and
be
killed
only
in
the
last
third
of
life
the
downhill
third
we
call
old
age
the
cottontails
had
enemies
on
every
side
their
daily
life
was
a
series
of
escapes
for
dogs
foxes
cats
skunks
coons
weasels
minks
snakes
hawks
owls
and
men
and
even
insects
were
all
plotting
to
kill
them
they
had
hundreds
of
adventures
and
at
least
once
a
day
they
had
to
fly
for
their
lives
and
save
themselves
by
their
legs
and
wits
more
than
once
that
hateful
fox
from
springfield
drove
them
to
taking
refuge
under
the
wreck
of
a
barbedwire
by
the
spring
but
once
there
they
could
look
calmly
at
him
while
he
spiked
his
legs
in
vain
attempts
to
reach
them
once
or
twice
rag
when
hunted
had
played
off
the
hound
against
a
skunk
that
had
seemed
likely
to
be
quite
as
dangerous
as
the
dog
once
he
was
caught
alive
by
a
hunter
who
had
a
hound
and
a
ferret
to
help
him
but
rag
had
the
luck
to
escape
next
day
with
a
yet
deeper
distrust
of
ground
holes
he
was
several
times
run
into
the
water
by
the
cat
and
many
times
was
chased
by
hawks
and
owls
but
for
each
kind
of
danger
there
was
a
safeguard
his
mother
taught
him
the
principal
dodges
and
he
improved
on
them
and
made
many
new
ones
as
he
grew
older
and
the
older
and
wiser
he
grew
the
less
he
trusted
to
his
legs
and
the
more
to
his
wits
for
safety
ranger
was
the
name
of
a
young
hound
in
the
neighborhood
to
train
him
his
master
used
to
put
him
on
the
trail
of
one
of
the
cottontails
it
was
nearly
always
rag
that
they
ran
for
the
young
buck
enjoyed
the
runs
as
much
as
they
did
the
spice
of
danger
in
them
being
just
enough
for
zest
he
would
say
oh
mother
here
comes
the
dog
again
i
must
have
a
run
you
are
too
bold
raggy
my
son
she
might
reply
i
fear
you
will
run
once
too
often
but
mother
it
is
such
glorious
fun
to
tease
that
fool
dog
and
all
good
training
i
thump
if
i
am
too
hard
pressed
then
you
can
come
and
change
off
while
i
get
my
second
wind
on
he
would
come
and
ranger
would
take
the
trail
and
follow
till
rag
got
tired
of
it
then
he
either
sent
a
thumping
telegram
for
help
which
brought
molly
to
take
charge
of
the
dog
or
he
got
rid
of
the
dog
by
some
clever
trick
a
description
of
one
of
these
shows
how
well
rag
had
learned
the
arts
of
the
woods
he
knew
that
his
scent
lay
best
near
the
ground
and
was
strongest
when
he
was
warm
so
if
he
could
get
off
the
ground
and
be
left
in
peace
for
half
an
hour
to
cool
off
and
for
the
trail
to
stale
he
knew
he
would
be
safe
when
therefore
he
tired
of
the
chase
he
made
for
the
creekside
where
he
that
is
till
he
left
a
course
so
crooked
that
the
dog
was
sure
to
be
greatly
delayed
in
working
it
out
he
then
went
straight
to
d
in
the
woods
passing
one
hop
to
windward
of
the
high
log
stopping
at
d
he
followed
his
back
trail
to
f
here
he
leaped
aside
and
ran
toward
then
returning
on
his
trail
to
j
he
waited
till
the
hound
passed
on
his
trail
at
rag
then
got
back
on
his
old
trail
at
h
and
followed
it
to
e
where
with
a
scentbaulk
or
great
leap
aside
he
reached
the
high
log
and
running
to
its
higher
end
he
sat
like
a
bump
ranger
lost
much
time
in
the
bramble
maze
and
the
scent
was
very
poor
when
he
got
it
straightened
out
and
came
to
here
he
began
to
circle
to
pick
it
up
and
after
losing
much
time
struck
the
trail
which
ended
suddenly
at
again
he
was
at
fault
and
had
to
circle
to
find
the
trail
wider
and
wider
circles
until
at
last
he
passed
right
under
the
log
rag
was
on
but
a
cold
scent
on
a
cold
day
does
not
go
downward
much
rag
never
budged
nor
winked
and
the
hound
passed
again
the
dog
came
round
this
time
he
crossed
the
low
part
of
the
log
and
stopped
to
smell
it
clearly
it
was
rabbity
but
it
was
a
stale
scent
now
still
he
mounted
the
log
it
was
a
trying
moment
for
rag
as
the
great
hound
came
along
the
log
but
his
nerve
did
not
forsake
him
the
wind
was
right
he
had
his
mind
made
up
to
bolt
as
soon
as
ranger
came
half
way
up
but
he
did
come
a
yellow
cur
would
have
seen
the
rabbit
sitting
there
but
the
hound
did
not
and
the
scent
seemed
stale
so
he
leaped
off
the
log
and
rag
had
won
vii
rag
had
never
seen
any
other
rabbit
than
his
mother
indeed
he
had
scarcely
thought
about
there
being
any
other
he
was
more
and
more
away
from
her
now
and
yet
he
never
felt
lonely
for
rabbits
do
not
hanker
for
company
but
one
day
in
december
while
he
was
among
the
red
dogwood
brush
cutting
a
new
path
to
the
great
creekside
thicket
he
saw
all
at
once
against
the
sky
over
the
sunning
bank
the
head
and
ears
of
a
strange
rabbit
the
newcomer
had
the
air
of
a
discoverer
and
soon
came
hopping
rag
way
along
one
of
his
paths
into
his
swamp
a
new
feeling
rushed
over
him
that
boiling
mixture
of
anger
and
hatred
called
jealousy
the
stranger
stopped
at
one
of
rag
that
is
a
tree
against
which
he
used
to
stand
on
his
heels
and
rub
his
chin
as
far
up
as
he
could
reach
he
thought
he
did
this
simply
because
he
liked
it
but
all
buckrabbits
do
so
and
several
ends
are
served
it
makes
the
tree
rabbity
so
that
other
rabbits
know
that
this
swamp
already
belongs
to
a
rabbit
family
and
is
not
open
for
settlement
it
also
lets
the
next
one
know
by
the
scent
if
the
last
caller
was
an
acquaintance
and
the
height
from
the
ground
of
the
shows
how
tall
the
rabbit
is
now
to
his
disgust
rag
noticed
that
the
was
a
head
taller
than
himself
and
a
big
stout
buck
at
that
this
was
a
wholly
new
experience
and
filled
rag
with
a
wholly
new
feeling
the
spirit
of
murder
entered
his
heart
he
chewed
very
hard
at
nothing
in
his
mouth
and
hopping
forward
onto
a
smooth
piece
of
hard
ground
he
struck
slowly
thump
thump
which
is
a
rabbit
telegram
for
out
of
my
swamp
or
fight
the
made
a
big
v
with
his
ears
sat
upright
for
a
few
seconds
then
dropping
on
his
sent
along
the
ground
a
louder
stronger
thump
thump
and
so
war
was
declared
they
came
together
by
short
runs
each
one
trying
to
get
the
wind
of
the
other
and
watching
for
a
chance
advantage
the
stranger
was
a
big
heavy
buck
with
plenty
of
muscle
but
one
or
two
trifles
such
as
treading
on
a
turnover
and
failing
to
close
when
rag
was
on
low
ground
showed
that
he
had
not
much
cunning
and
counted
on
winning
his
battles
by
his
weight
on
he
came
at
last
and
rag
met
him
like
a
little
fury
as
they
came
together
they
leaped
up
and
struck
out
with
their
hind
feet
thud
thud
they
came
and
down
went
poor
little
rag
in
a
moment
the
stranger
was
on
him
with
his
teeth
and
rag
was
bitten
and
lost
several
tufts
of
hair
before
he
could
get
up
but
he
was
swift
of
foot
and
got
out
of
reach
again
he
charged
and
again
he
was
knocked
down
and
bitten
severely
he
was
no
match
for
his
foe
and
it
soon
became
a
question
of
saving
his
own
life
hurt
as
he
was
he
sprang
away
with
the
stranger
in
full
chase
and
bound
to
kill
him
as
well
as
to
oust
him
from
the
swamp
where
he
was
born
rag
legs
were
good
and
so
was
his
wind
the
stranger
was
big
and
so
heavy
that
he
soon
gave
up
the
chase
and
it
was
well
for
poor
rag
that
he
did
for
he
was
getting
stiff
from
his
wounds
as
well
as
tired
from
that
day
began
a
reign
of
terror
for
rag
his
training
had
been
against
owls
dogs
weasels
men
and
so
on
but
what
to
do
when
chased
by
another
rabbit
he
did
not
know
all
he
knew
was
to
lie
low
till
he
was
found
then
run
poor
little
molly
was
completely
terrorized
she
could
not
help
rag
and
sought
only
to
hide
but
the
big
buck
soon
found
her
out
she
tried
to
run
from
him
but
she
was
not
now
so
swift
as
rag
the
stranger
made
no
attempt
to
kill
her
but
he
made
love
to
her
and
because
she
hated
him
and
tried
to
get
away
he
treated
her
shamefully
day
after
day
he
worried
her
by
following
her
about
and
often
furious
at
her
lasting
hatred
he
would
knock
her
down
and
tear
out
mouthfuls
of
her
soft
fur
till
his
rage
cooled
somewhat
when
he
would
let
her
go
for
a
while
but
his
fixed
purpose
was
to
kill
rag
whose
escape
seemed
hopeless
there
was
no
other
swamp
he
could
go
to
and
whenever
he
took
a
nap
now
he
had
to
be
ready
at
any
moment
to
dash
for
his
life
a
dozen
times
a
day
the
big
stranger
came
creeping
up
to
where
he
slept
but
each
time
the
watchful
rag
awoke
in
time
to
escape
to
escape
yet
not
to
escape
he
saved
his
life
indeed
but
oh
what
a
miserable
life
it
had
become
how
maddening
to
be
thus
helpless
to
see
his
little
mother
daily
beaten
and
torn
as
well
as
to
see
all
his
favorite
the
cosy
nooks
and
the
pathways
he
had
made
with
so
much
labor
forced
from
him
by
this
hateful
brute
unhappy
rag
realized
that
to
the
victor
belong
the
spoils
and
he
hated
him
more
than
ever
he
did
fox
or
ferret
how
was
it
to
end
he
was
wearing
out
with
running
and
watching
and
bad
food
and
little
molly
strength
and
spirit
were
breaking
down
under
the
long
persecution
the
stranger
was
ready
to
go
to
all
lengths
to
destroy
poor
rag
and
at
last
stooped
to
the
worst
crime
known
among
rabbits
however
much
they
may
hate
each
other
all
good
rabbits
forget
their
feuds
when
their
common
enemy
appears
yet
one
day
when
a
great
goshawk
came
swooping
over
the
swamp
the
stranger
keeping
well
under
cover
himself
tried
again
and
again
to
drive
rag
into
the
open
once
or
twice
the
hawk
nearly
had
him
but
still
the
briers
saved
him
and
it
was
only
when
the
big
buck
himself
came
near
being
caught
that
he
gave
it
up
and
again
rag
escaped
no
better
off
he
made
up
his
mind
to
leave
with
his
mother
if
possible
next
night
and
go
into
the
world
in
quest
of
some
new
home
when
he
heard
old
thunder
the
hound
sniffing
and
searching
about
the
outskirts
of
the
swamp
and
he
resolved
on
playing
a
desperate
game
he
deliberately
crossed
the
hound
view
and
the
chase
that
then
began
was
fast
and
furious
thrice
around
the
swamp
they
went
till
rag
had
made
sure
that
his
mother
was
hidden
safely
and
that
his
hated
foe
was
in
his
usual
nest
then
right
into
that
nest
and
plump
over
him
he
jumped
giving
him
a
rap
with
one
hind
foot
as
he
passed
over
his
head
you
miserable
fool
i
kill
you
yet
cried
the
stranger
and
up
he
jumped
only
to
find
himself
between
rag
and
the
dog
and
heir
to
all
the
peril
of
the
chase
on
came
the
hound
baying
hotly
on
the
scent
the
weight
and
size
were
great
advantages
in
a
rabbit
fight
but
now
they
were
fatal
he
did
not
know
many
tricks
just
the
simple
ones
like
and
that
every
baby
bunny
knows
but
the
chase
was
too
close
for
doubling
and
winding
and
he
did
know
where
the
holes
were
it
was
a
straight
race
the
brierrose
kind
to
all
rabbits
alike
did
its
best
but
it
was
no
use
the
baying
of
the
hound
was
fast
and
steady
the
crashing
of
the
brush
and
the
yelping
of
the
hound
each
time
the
briers
tore
his
tender
ears
were
borne
to
the
two
rabbits
where
they
crouched
in
hiding
but
suddenly
these
sounds
stopped
there
was
a
scuffle
then
loud
and
terrible
screaming
rag
knew
what
it
meant
and
it
sent
a
shiver
through
him
but
he
soon
forgot
that
when
all
was
over
and
rejoiced
to
be
once
more
the
master
of
the
dear
old
swamp
viii
old
olifant
had
doubtless
a
right
to
burn
all
those
in
the
east
and
south
of
the
swamp
and
to
clear
up
the
wreck
of
the
old
just
below
the
spring
but
it
was
none
the
less
hard
on
rag
and
his
mother
the
first
were
their
various
residences
and
outposts
and
the
second
their
grand
fastness
and
safe
retreat
they
had
so
long
held
the
swamp
and
felt
it
to
be
their
very
own
in
every
part
and
suburb
including
olifant
grounds
and
buildings
that
they
would
have
resented
the
appearance
of
another
rabbit
even
about
the
adjoining
barnyard
their
claim
that
of
long
successful
occupancy
was
exactly
the
same
as
that
by
which
most
nations
hold
their
land
and
it
would
be
hard
to
find
a
better
right
during
the
time
of
the
january
thaw
the
olifants
had
cut
the
rest
of
the
large
wood
about
the
pond
and
curtailed
the
cottontails
domain
on
all
sides
but
they
still
clung
to
the
dwindling
swamp
for
it
was
their
home
and
they
were
loath
to
move
to
foreign
parts
their
life
of
daily
perils
went
on
but
they
were
still
fleet
of
foot
long
of
wind
and
bright
of
wit
of
late
they
had
been
somewhat
troubled
by
a
mink
that
had
wandered
upstream
to
their
quiet
nook
a
little
judicious
guidance
had
transferred
the
uncomfortable
visitor
to
olifant
but
they
were
not
yet
quite
sure
that
he
had
been
properly
looked
after
so
for
the
present
they
gave
up
using
the
which
were
of
course
dangerous
and
stuck
closer
than
ever
to
the
briers
and
the
that
were
left
that
first
snow
had
quite
gone
and
the
weather
was
bright
and
warm
until
now
molly
feeling
a
touch
of
rheumatism
was
somewhere
in
the
lower
thicket
seeking
a
teaberry
tonic
rag
was
sitting
in
the
weak
sunlight
on
a
bank
in
the
east
side
the
smoke
from
the
familiar
gable
chimney
of
olifant
house
came
fitfully
drifting
a
pale
blue
haze
through
the
underwoods
and
showing
as
a
dull
brown
against
the
brightness
of
the
sky
the
gable
was
cut
off
midway
by
the
banks
of
brier
brush
that
purple
in
shadow
shone
like
rods
of
blazing
crimson
and
gold
in
the
light
beyond
the
house
the
barn
with
its
gable
and
roof
new
gift
at
the
house
stood
up
like
a
noah
ark
the
sounds
that
came
from
it
and
yet
more
the
delicious
smell
that
mingled
with
the
smoke
told
rag
that
the
animals
were
being
fed
cabbage
in
the
yard
rag
mouth
watered
at
the
idea
of
the
feast
he
blinked
and
blinked
as
he
snuffed
its
odorous
promises
for
he
loved
cabbage
dearly
but
then
he
had
been
to
the
barnyard
the
night
before
after
a
few
paltry
and
no
wise
rabbit
would
go
two
nights
running
to
the
same
place
therefore
he
did
the
wise
thing
he
moved
across
where
he
could
not
smell
the
cabbage
and
made
his
supper
of
a
bundle
of
hay
that
had
been
blown
from
the
stack
later
when
about
to
settle
for
the
night
he
was
joined
by
molly
who
had
taken
her
teaberry
and
then
eaten
her
frugal
meal
of
sweet
birch
near
the
sunning
bank
meanwhile
the
sun
had
gone
about
his
business
elsewhere
taking
all
his
gold
and
glory
with
him
off
in
the
east
a
big
black
shutter
came
pushing
up
and
rising
higher
and
higher
it
spread
over
the
whole
sky
shut
out
all
light
and
left
the
world
a
very
gloomy
place
indeed
then
another
the
wind
taking
advantage
of
the
sun
absence
came
on
the
scene
and
set
about
brewing
trouble
the
weather
turned
colder
and
colder
it
seemed
worse
than
when
the
ground
had
been
covered
with
snow
is
this
terribly
cold
how
i
wish
we
had
our
said
rag
a
good
night
for
the
hole
replied
molly
but
we
have
not
yet
seen
the
pelt
of
that
mink
on
the
end
of
the
barn
and
it
is
not
safe
till
we
do
the
hollow
hickory
was
gone
in
fact
at
this
very
moment
its
trunk
lying
in
the
was
harboring
the
mink
they
feared
so
the
cottontails
hopped
to
the
south
side
of
the
pond
and
choosing
a
they
crept
under
and
snuggled
down
for
the
night
facing
the
wind
but
with
their
noses
in
different
directions
so
as
to
go
out
different
ways
in
case
of
alarm
the
wind
blew
harder
and
colder
as
the
hours
went
by
and
about
midnight
a
fine
icy
snow
came
ticking
down
on
the
dead
leaves
and
hissing
through
the
it
might
seem
a
poor
night
for
hunting
but
that
old
fox
from
springfield
was
out
he
came
pointing
up
the
wind
in
the
shelter
of
the
swamp
and
chanced
in
the
lee
of
the
where
he
scented
the
sleeping
he
halted
for
a
moment
then
came
stealthily
sneaking
up
toward
the
brush
under
which
his
nose
told
him
the
rabbits
were
crouching
the
noise
of
the
wind
and
the
sleet
enabled
him
to
come
quite
close
before
molly
heard
the
faint
crunch
of
a
dry
leaf
under
his
paw
she
touched
whiskers
and
both
were
fully
awake
just
as
the
fox
sprang
on
them
but
they
always
slept
with
their
legs
ready
for
a
jump
molly
darted
out
into
the
blinding
storm
the
fox
missed
his
spring
but
followed
like
a
racer
while
rag
dashed
off
to
one
side
there
was
only
one
road
for
molly
that
was
straight
up
the
wind
and
bounding
for
her
life
she
gained
a
little
over
the
unfrozen
mud
that
would
not
carry
the
fox
till
she
reached
the
margin
of
the
pond
no
chance
to
turn
now
on
she
must
go
splash
splash
through
the
weeds
she
went
then
plunge
into
the
deep
water
and
plunge
went
the
fox
close
behind
but
it
was
too
much
for
reynard
on
such
a
night
he
turned
back
and
molly
seeing
only
one
course
struggled
through
the
reeds
into
the
deep
water
and
struck
out
for
the
other
shore
but
there
was
a
strong
headwind
the
little
waves
icy
cold
broke
over
her
head
as
she
swam
and
the
water
was
full
of
snow
that
blocked
her
way
like
soft
ice
or
floating
mud
the
dark
line
of
the
other
shore
seemed
far
far
away
with
perhaps
the
fox
waiting
for
her
there
but
she
laid
her
ears
flat
to
be
out
of
the
gale
and
bravely
put
forth
all
her
strength
with
wind
and
tide
against
her
after
a
long
weary
swim
in
the
cold
water
she
had
nearly
reached
the
farther
reeds
when
a
great
mass
of
floating
snow
barred
her
road
then
the
wind
on
the
bank
made
strange
sounds
that
robbed
her
of
all
force
and
she
was
drifted
far
backward
before
she
could
get
free
from
the
floating
bar
again
she
struck
out
but
slowly
oh
so
slowly
now
and
when
at
last
she
reached
the
lee
of
the
tall
reeds
her
limbs
were
numbed
her
strength
spent
her
brave
little
heart
was
sinking
and
she
cared
no
more
whether
the
fox
were
there
or
not
through
the
reeds
she
did
indeed
pass
but
once
in
the
weeds
her
course
wavered
and
slowed
her
feeble
strokes
no
longer
sent
her
landward
the
ice
forming
around
her
stopped
her
altogether
in
a
little
while
the
cold
weak
limbs
ceased
to
move
the
furry
of
the
little
mother
cottontail
wobbled
no
more
and
the
soft
brown
eyes
were
closed
in
death
but
there
was
no
fox
waiting
to
tear
her
with
ravenous
jaws
rag
had
escaped
the
first
onset
of
the
foe
and
as
soon
as
he
regained
his
wits
he
came
running
back
to
and
so
help
his
mother
he
met
the
old
fox
going
round
the
pond
to
meet
molly
and
led
him
far
and
away
then
dismissed
him
with
a
gash
on
his
head
and
came
to
the
bank
and
sought
about
and
trailed
and
thumped
but
all
his
searching
was
in
vain
he
could
not
find
his
little
mother
he
never
saw
her
again
and
he
never
knew
whither
she
went
for
she
slept
her
sleep
in
the
of
her
friend
the
water
that
tells
no
tales
poor
little
molly
cottontail
she
was
a
true
heroine
yet
only
one
of
unnumbered
millions
that
without
a
thought
of
heroism
have
lived
and
done
their
best
in
their
little
world
and
died
she
fought
a
good
fight
in
the
battle
of
life
she
was
good
stuff
the
stuff
that
never
dies
for
flesh
of
her
flesh
and
brain
of
her
brain
was
rag
she
lives
in
him
and
through
him
transmits
a
finer
fibre
to
her
race
and
rag
still
lives
in
the
swamp
old
olifant
died
that
winter
and
the
unthrifty
sons
ceased
to
clear
the
swamp
or
mend
the
wire
fences
within
a
single
year
it
was
a
wilder
place
than
ever
fresh
trees
and
brambles
grew
and
falling
wires
made
many
cottontail
castles

retreats

the
story
of
my
dog
i
it
was
early
in
november
and
the
manitoba
winter
had
just
set
in
i
was
tilting
back
in
my
chair
for
a
few
lazy
moments
after
breakfast
idly
alternating
my
gaze
from
the
one
of
our
shanty
through
which
was
framed
a
bit
of
the
prairie
and
the
end
of
our
cowshed
to
the
old
rhyme
of
the
dogge
pinned
on
the
logs
near
by
but
the
dreamy
mixture
of
rhyme
and
view
was
quickly
dispelled
by
the
sight
of
a
large
gray
animal
dashing
across
the
prairie
into
the
cowshed
with
a
smaller
black
and
white
animal
in
hot
pursuit
a
wolf
i
exclaimed
and
seizing
a
rifle
dashed
out
to
help
the
dog
but
before
i
could
get
there
they
had
left
the
stable
and
after
a
short
run
over
the
snow
the
wolf
again
turned
at
bay
and
the
dog
our
neighbor
collie
circled
about
watching
his
chance
to
snap
i
fired
a
couple
of
long
shots
which
had
the
effect
only
of
setting
them
off
again
over
the
prairie
after
another
run
this
matchless
dog
closed
and
seized
the
wolf
by
the
haunch
but
again
retreated
to
avoid
the
fierce
return
chop
then
there
was
another
stand
at
bay
and
again
a
race
over
the
snow
every
few
hundred
yards
this
scene
was
repeated
the
dog
managing
so
that
each
fresh
rush
should
be
toward
the
settlement
while
the
wolf
vainly
tried
to
break
back
toward
the
dark
belt
of
trees
in
the
east
at
last
after
a
mile
of
this
fighting
and
running
i
overtook
them
and
the
dog
seeing
that
he
now
had
good
backing
closed
in
for
the
finish
after
a
few
seconds
the
whirl
of
struggling
animals
resolved
itself
into
a
wolf
on
his
back
with
a
bleeding
collie
gripping
his
throat
and
it
was
now
easy
for
me
to
step
up
and
end
the
fight
by
putting
a
ball
through
the
wolf
head
then
when
this
dog
of
marvellous
wind
saw
that
his
foe
was
dead
he
gave
him
no
second
glance
but
set
out
at
a
lope
for
a
farm
four
miles
across
the
snow
where
he
had
left
his
master
when
first
the
wolf
was
started
he
was
a
wonderful
dog
and
even
if
i
had
not
come
he
undoubtedly
would
have
killed
the
wolf
alone
as
i
learned
he
had
already
done
with
others
of
the
kind
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
wolf
though
of
the
smaller
or
prairie
race
was
much
larger
than
himself
i
was
filled
with
admiration
for
the
dog
prowess
and
at
once
sought
to
buy
him
at
any
price
the
scornful
reply
of
his
owner
was
why
do
you
try
to
buy
one
of
the
children
since
frank
was
not
in
the
market
i
was
obliged
to
content
myself
with
the
next
best
thing
one
of
his
alleged
progeny
that
is
a
son
of
his
wife
this
probable
offspring
of
an
illustrious
sire
was
a
ball
of
black
fur
that
looked
more
like
a
bearcub
than
a
puppy
but
he
had
some
tan
markings
like
those
on
frank
coat
that
were
i
hoped
guarantees
of
future
greatness
and
also
a
very
characteristic
ring
of
white
that
he
always
wore
on
his
muzzle
having
got
possession
of
his
person
the
next
thing
was
to
find
him
a
name
surely
this
puzzle
was
already
solved
the
rhyme
of
the
dogge
was
with
the
foundation
of
our
acquaintance
so
with
adequate
pomp
yclept
him
little
bingo
ii
the
rest
of
that
winter
bingo
spent
in
our
shanty
living
the
life
of
a
blubbery
fat
puppy
gorging
himself
with
food
and
growing
bigger
and
clumsier
each
day
even
sad
experience
failed
to
teach
him
that
he
must
keep
his
nose
out
of
the
rat
trap
his
most
friendly
overtures
to
the
cat
were
wholly
misunderstood
and
resulted
only
in
an
armed
neutrality
that
varied
by
occasional
reigns
of
terror
continued
to
the
end
which
came
when
bingo
who
early
showed
a
mind
of
his
own
got
a
notion
for
sleeping
at
the
barn
and
avoiding
the
shanty
altogether
when
the
spring
came
i
set
about
his
serious
education
after
much
pains
on
my
behalf
and
many
pains
on
his
he
learned
to
go
at
the
word
in
quest
of
our
old
yellow
cow
that
pastured
at
will
on
the
unfenced
prairie
once
he
had
learned
his
business
he
became
very
fond
of
it
and
nothing
pleased
him
more
than
an
order
to
go
and
fetch
the
cow
away
he
would
dash
barking
with
pleasure
and
leaping
high
in
the
air
that
he
might
better
scan
the
plain
for
his
victim
in
a
short
time
he
would
return
driving
her
at
full
gallop
before
him
and
gave
her
no
peace
until
puffing
and
blowing
she
was
safely
driven
into
the
farthest
corner
of
her
stable
less
energy
on
his
part
would
have
been
more
satisfactory
but
we
bore
with
him
until
he
grew
so
fond
of
this
hunt
that
he
began
to
bring
dunne
without
being
told
and
at
length
not
once
or
twice
but
a
dozen
times
a
day
this
energetic
cowherd
would
sally
forth
on
his
own
responsibility
and
drive
the
cow
home
to
the
stable
at
last
things
came
to
such
a
pass
that
whenever
he
felt
like
taking
a
little
exercise
or
had
a
few
minutes
of
spare
time
or
even
happened
to
think
of
it
bingo
would
sally
forth
at
racing
speed
over
the
plain
and
a
few
minutes
later
return
driving
the
unhappy
yellow
cow
at
full
gallop
before
him
at
first
this
did
not
seem
very
bad
as
it
kept
the
cow
from
straying
too
far
but
soon
it
was
seen
that
it
hindered
her
feeding
she
became
thin
and
gave
less
milk
it
seemed
to
weigh
on
her
mind
too
as
she
was
always
watching
nervously
for
that
hateful
dog
and
in
the
mornings
would
hang
around
the
stable
as
though
afraid
to
venture
off
and
subject
herself
at
once
to
an
onset
this
was
going
too
far
all
attempts
to
make
bingo
more
moderate
in
his
pleasure
were
failures
so
he
was
compelled
to
give
it
up
altogether
after
this
though
he
dared
not
bring
her
home
he
continued
to
show
his
interest
by
lying
at
her
stable
door
while
she
was
being
milked
as
the
summer
came
on
the
mosquitoes
became
a
dreadful
plague
and
the
consequent
vicious
switching
of
dunne
tail
at
was
even
more
annoying
than
the
mosquitoes
fred
the
brother
who
did
the
milking
was
of
an
inventive
as
well
as
an
impatient
turn
of
mind
and
he
devised
a
simple
plan
to
stop
the
switching
he
fastened
a
brick
to
the
cow
tail
then
set
blithely
about
his
work
assured
of
unusual
comfort
while
the
rest
of
us
looked
on
in
doubt
suddenly
through
the
mist
of
mosquitoes
came
a
dull
whack
and
an
outburst
of
the
cow
went
on
placidly
chewing
till
fred
got
on
his
feet
and
furiously
attacked
her
with
the
it
was
bad
enough
to
be
whacked
on
the
ear
with
a
brick
by
a
stupid
old
cow
but
the
uproarious
enjoyment
and
ridicule
of
the
bystanders
made
it
unendurable
bingo
hearing
the
uproar
and
divining
that
he
was
needed
rushed
in
and
attacked
dunne
on
the
other
side
before
the
affair
quieted
down
the
milk
was
spilt
the
pail
and
stool
were
broken
and
the
cow
and
the
dog
severely
beaten
poor
bingo
could
not
understand
it
at
all
he
had
long
ago
learned
to
despise
that
cow
and
now
in
utter
disgust
he
decided
to
forsake
even
her
stable
door
and
from
that
time
be
attached
himself
exclusively
to
the
horses
and
their
stable
the
cattle
were
mine
the
horses
were
my
brother
and
in
transferring
his
allegiance
from
the
to
the
bingo
seemed
to
give
me
up
too
and
anything
like
daily
companionship
ceased
and
yet
whenever
any
emergency
arose
bingo
turned
to
me
and
i
to
him
and
both
seemed
to
feel
that
the
bond
between
man
and
dog
is
one
that
lasts
as
long
as
life
the
only
other
occasion
on
which
bingo
acted
as
cowherd
was
in
the
autumn
of
the
same
year
at
the
annual
carberry
fair
among
the
dazzling
inducements
to
enter
one
stock
there
was
in
addition
to
a
prospect
of
glory
a
cash
prize
of
dollars
for
the
collie
in
training
misled
by
a
false
friend
i
entered
bingo
and
early
on
the
day
fixed
the
cow
was
driven
to
the
prairie
just
outside
of
the
village
when
the
time
came
she
was
pointed
out
to
bingo
and
the
word
given
fetch
the
cow
it
was
the
intention
of
course
that
he
should
bring
her
to
me
at
the
judge
stand
but
the
animals
knew
better
they
had
rehearsed
all
summer
for
nothing
when
dunne
saw
bingo
careering
form
she
knew
that
her
only
hope
for
safety
was
to
get
into
her
stable
and
bingo
was
equally
sure
that
his
sole
mission
in
life
was
to
quicken
her
pace
in
that
direction
so
off
they
raced
over
the
prairie
like
a
wolf
after
a
deer
and
heading
straight
toward
their
home
two
miles
way
they
disappeared
from
view
that
was
the
last
that
judge
or
jury
ever
saw
of
dog
or
cow
the
prize
was
awarded
to
the
only
other
entry
iii
bingo
loyalty
to
the
horses
was
quite
remarkable
by
day
he
trotted
beside
them
and
by
night
he
slept
at
the
stable
door
where
the
team
went
bingo
went
and
nothing
kept
him
away
from
them
this
interesting
assumption
of
ownership
lent
the
greater
significance
to
the
following
circumstance
i
was
not
superstitious
and
up
to
this
time
had
had
no
faith
in
omens
but
was
now
deeply
impressed
by
a
strange
occurrence
in
which
bingo
took
a
leading
part
there
were
but
two
of
us
now
living
on
the
de
winton
farm
one
morning
my
brother
set
out
for
boggy
creek
for
a
load
of
hay
it
was
a
long
day
journey
there
and
back
and
he
made
an
early
start
strange
to
tell
bingo
for
once
in
his
life
did
not
follow
the
team
my
brother
called
to
him
but
still
he
stood
at
a
safe
distance
and
eyeing
the
team
askance
refused
to
stir
suddenly
he
raised
his
nose
in
the
air
and
gave
vent
to
a
long
melancholy
howl
he
watched
the
wagon
out
of
sight
and
even
followed
for
a
hundred
yards
or
so
raising
his
voice
from
time
to
time
in
the
most
doleful
howlings
all
that
day
he
stayed
about
the
barn
the
only
time
that
he
was
willingly
separated
from
the
horses
and
at
intervals
howled
a
very
death
dirge
i
was
alone
and
the
dog
behavior
inspired
me
with
an
awful
foreboding
of
calamity
that
weighed
upon
us
more
and
more
as
the
hours
passed
away
about
six
bingo
howlings
became
unbearable
so
that
for
lack
of
a
better
thought
i
threw
something
at
him
and
ordered
him
away
but
oh
the
feeling
of
horror
that
filled
me
why
did
i
let
my
brother
go
away
alone
should
i
ever
again
see
him
alive
i
might
have
known
from
the
dog
actions
that
something
dreadful
was
about
to
happen
at
length
the
hour
for
his
return
arrived
and
there
was
john
on
his
load
i
took
charge
of
the
horses
vastly
relieved
and
with
an
air
of
assumed
unconcern
asked
all
right
right
was
the
laconic
answer
who
now
can
say
that
there
is
nothing
in
omens
and
yet
when
long
afterward
i
told
this
to
one
skilled
in
the
occult
he
looked
grave
and
said
bingo
always
turned
to
you
in
a
crisis
yes
then
do
not
smile
it
was
you
that
were
in
danger
that
day
he
stayed
and
saved
your
life
though
you
never
knew
from
what
iv
early
in
the
spring
i
had
begun
bingo
education
very
shortly
afterward
he
began
mine
midway
on
the
stretch
of
prairie
that
lay
between
our
shanty
and
the
village
of
carberry
was
the
of
the
farm
it
was
a
stout
post
in
a
low
mound
of
earth
and
was
visible
from
afar
i
soon
noticed
that
bingo
never
passed
without
minutely
examining
this
mysterious
post
next
i
learned
that
it
was
also
visited
by
the
prairie
wolves
as
well
as
by
all
the
dogs
in
the
neighborhood
and
at
length
with
the
aid
of
a
telescope
i
made
a
number
of
observations
that
helped
me
to
an
understanding
of
the
matter
and
enabled
me
to
enter
more
fully
into
bingo
private
life
the
post
was
by
common
agreement
a
registry
of
the
canine
tribes
their
exquisite
sense
of
smell
enabled
each
individual
to
tell
at
once
by
the
track
and
trace
what
other
had
recently
been
at
the
post
when
the
snow
came
much
more
was
revealed
i
then
discovered
that
this
post
was
but
one
of
a
system
that
covered
the
country
that
in
short
the
entire
region
was
laid
out
in
signal
stations
at
convenient
intervals
these
were
marked
by
any
conspicuous
post
stone
buffalo
skull
or
other
object
that
chanced
to
be
in
the
desired
locality
and
extensive
observation
showed
that
it
was
a
very
complete
system
for
getting
and
giving
the
news
each
dog
or
wolf
makes
a
point
of
calling
at
those
stations
that
are
near
his
line
of
travel
to
learn
who
has
recently
been
there
just
as
a
man
calls
at
his
club
on
returning
to
town
and
looks
up
the
register
i
have
seen
bingo
approach
the
post
sniff
examine
the
ground
about
then
growl
and
with
bristling
mane
and
glowing
eyes
scratch
fiercely
and
contemptuously
with
his
hind
feet
finally
walking
off
very
stiffly
glancing
back
from
time
to
time
all
of
which
being
interpreted
said
grrrh
woof
there
that
dirty
cur
of
mccarthy
woof
i
to
him
tonight
woof
woof
on
another
occasion
after
the
preliminaries
he
became
keenly
interested
and
studied
a
coyote
track
that
came
and
went
saying
to
himself
as
i
afterward
learned
a
coyote
track
coming
from
the
north
smelling
of
dead
cow
indeed
pollworth
old
brindle
must
be
dead
at
last
this
is
worth
looking
into
at
other
times
he
would
wag
his
tail
trot
about
the
vicinity
and
come
again
and
again
to
make
his
own
visit
more
evident
perhaps
for
the
benefit
of
his
brother
bill
just
back
from
brandon
so
that
it
was
not
by
chance
that
one
night
bill
turned
up
at
bingo
home
and
was
taken
to
the
hills
where
a
delicious
dead
horse
afforded
a
chance
to
suitably
celebrate
the
reunion
at
other
times
he
would
be
suddenly
aroused
by
the
news
take
up
the
trail
and
race
to
the
next
station
for
later
information
sometimes
his
inspection
produced
only
an
air
of
grave
attention
as
though
he
said
to
himself
dear
me
who
the
deuce
is
this
or
it
seems
to
me
i
met
that
fellow
at
the
portage
last
summer
one
morning
on
approaching
the
post
bingo
every
hair
stood
on
end
his
tail
dropped
and
quivered
and
he
gave
proof
that
he
was
suddenly
sick
at
the
stomach
sure
signs
of
terror
he
showed
no
desire
to
follow
up
or
know
more
of
the
matter
but
returned
to
the
house
and
half
an
hour
afterward
his
mane
was
still
bristling
and
his
expression
one
of
hate
or
fear
i
studied
the
dreaded
track
and
learned
that
in
bingo
language
the
means
wolf
these
were
among
the
things
that
bingo
taught
me
and
in
the
after
time
when
i
might
chance
to
see
him
arouse
from
his
frosty
nest
by
the
stable
door
and
after
stretching
himself
and
shaking
the
snow
from
his
shaggy
coat
disappear
into
the
gloom
at
a
steady
trot
trot
trot
i
used
to
think
ahh
old
dog
i
know
where
you
are
off
to
and
why
you
eschew
the
shelter
of
the
shanty
now
i
know
why
your
nightly
trips
over
the
country
are
so
well
timed
and
how
you
know
just
where
to
go
for
what
you
want
and
when
and
how
to
seek
it
v
in
the
autumn
of
the
shanty
at
de
winton
farm
was
closed
and
bingo
changed
his
home
to
the
establishment
that
is
to
the
stable
not
the
house
of
gordon
wright
our
most
intimate
neighbor
since
the
winter
of
his
puppyhood
he
had
declined
to
enter
a
house
at
any
time
excepting
during
a
thunderstorm
of
thunder
and
guns
he
had
a
deep
dread
no
doubt
the
fear
of
the
first
originated
in
the
second
and
that
arose
from
some
unpleasant
experiences
the
cause
of
which
will
be
seen
his
nightly
couch
was
outside
the
stable
even
during
the
coldest
weather
and
it
was
easy
to
see
he
enjoyed
to
the
full
the
complete
nocturnal
liberty
entailed
bingo
midnight
wanderings
extended
across
the
plains
for
miles
there
was
plenty
of
proof
of
this
some
farmers
at
very
remote
points
sent
word
to
old
gordon
that
if
he
did
not
keep
his
dog
home
nights
they
would
use
the
and
bingo
terror
of
firearms
would
indicate
that
the
threats
were
not
idle
a
man
living
as
far
away
as
petrel
said
he
saw
a
large
black
wolf
kill
a
coyote
on
the
snow
one
winter
evening
but
afterward
he
changed
his
opinion
and
it
must
been
wright
dog
whenever
the
body
of
a
ox
or
horse
was
exposed
bingo
was
sure
to
repair
to
it
nightly
and
driving
away
the
prairie
wolves
feast
to
repletion
sometimes
the
object
of
a
night
foray
was
merely
to
maul
some
distant
neighbor
dog
and
notwithstanding
vengeful
threats
there
seemed
no
reason
to
fear
that
the
bingo
breed
would
die
out
one
man
even
avowed
that
he
had
seen
a
prairie
wolf
accompanied
by
three
young
ones
which
resembled
the
mother
excepting
that
they
were
very
large
and
black
and
had
a
ring
of
white
around
the
muzzle
true
or
not
as
that
may
be
i
know
that
late
in
march
while
we
were
out
in
the
sleigh
with
bingo
trotting
behind
a
prairie
wolf
was
started
from
a
hollow
away
it
went
with
bingo
in
full
chase
but
the
wolf
did
not
greatly
exert
itself
to
escape
and
within
a
short
distance
bingo
was
close
up
yet
strange
to
tell
there
was
no
grappling
no
fight
bingo
trotted
amiably
alongside
and
licked
the
wolf
nose
we
were
astounded
and
shouted
to
urge
bingo
on
our
shouting
and
approach
several
times
started
the
wolf
off
at
speed
and
bingo
again
pursued
until
he
had
overtaken
it
but
his
gentleness
was
too
obvious
it
is
a
he
wo
harm
her
i
exclaimed
as
the
truth
dawned
on
me
and
gordon
said
well
i
be
darned
so
we
called
our
unwilling
dog
and
drove
on
for
weeks
after
this
we
were
annoyed
by
the
depredations
of
a
prairie
wolf
who
killed
our
chickens
stole
pieces
of
pork
from
the
end
of
the
house
and
several
times
terrified
the
children
by
looking
into
the
window
of
the
shanty
while
the
men
were
away
against
this
animal
bingo
seemed
to
be
no
safeguard
at
length
the
wolf
a
female
was
killed
and
then
bingo
plainly
showed
his
hand
by
his
lasting
enmity
toward
oliver
the
man
who
did
the
deed
vi
it
is
wonderful
and
beautiful
how
a
man
and
his
dog
will
stick
to
one
another
through
thick
and
thin
butler
tells
of
an
undivided
indian
tribe
in
the
far
north
which
was
all
but
exterminated
by
an
internecine
feud
over
a
dog
that
belonged
to
one
man
and
was
killed
by
his
neighbor
and
among
ourselves
we
have
lawsuits
fights
and
deadly
feuds
all
pointing
the
same
old
moral
me
love
my
dog
one
of
our
neighbors
had
a
very
fine
hound
that
he
thought
the
best
and
dearest
dog
in
the
world
i
loved
him
so
i
loved
his
dog
and
when
one
day
poor
tan
crawled
home
terribly
mangled
and
died
by
the
door
i
joined
my
threats
of
vengeance
with
those
of
his
master
and
thenceforth
lost
no
opportunity
of
tracing
the
miscreant
both
by
offering
rewards
and
by
collecting
scraps
of
evidence
at
length
it
was
clear
that
one
of
three
men
to
the
southward
had
had
a
hand
in
the
cruel
affair
the
scent
was
warming
up
and
soon
we
should
have
been
in
a
position
to
exact
rigorous
justice
at
least
from
the
wretch
who
had
murdered
poor
old
tan
then
something
took
place
which
at
once
changed
my
mind
and
led
me
to
believe
that
the
mangling
of
the
old
hound
was
not
by
any
means
an
unpardonable
crime
but
indeed
on
second
thoughts
was
rather
commendable
than
otherwise
gordon
wright
farm
lay
to
the
south
of
us
and
while
there
one
day
gordon
knowing
that
i
was
tracking
the
murderer
took
me
aside
and
looking
about
furtively
he
whispered
in
tragic
tones
it
was
bing
done
it
and
the
matter
dropped
right
there
for
i
confess
that
from
that
moment
i
did
all
in
my
power
to
baffle
the
justice
i
had
previously
striven
so
hard
to
further
i
had
given
bingo
away
long
before
but
the
feeling
of
ownership
did
not
die
and
of
this
indissoluble
fellowship
of
dog
and
man
he
was
soon
to
take
part
in
another
important
illustration
old
gordon
and
oliver
were
close
neighbors
and
friends
they
joined
in
a
contract
to
cut
wood
and
worked
together
harmoniously
till
late
on
in
winter
then
oliver
old
horse
died
and
he
determining
to
profit
as
far
as
possible
dragged
it
out
on
the
plain
and
laid
poison
baits
for
wolves
around
it
alas
for
poor
bingo
he
would
lead
a
wolfish
life
though
again
and
again
it
brought
him
into
wolfish
misfortunes
he
was
as
fond
of
dead
horse
as
any
of
his
wild
kindred
that
very
night
with
wright
own
dog
curley
he
visited
the
carcass
it
seemed
as
though
bing
had
busied
himself
chiefly
keeping
off
the
wolves
but
curley
feasted
immoderately
the
tracks
in
the
snow
told
the
story
of
the
banquet
the
interruption
as
the
poison
began
to
work
and
of
the
dreadful
spasms
of
pain
during
the
erratic
course
back
home
where
curley
falling
in
convulsions
at
gordon
feet
died
in
the
greatest
agony
me
love
my
dog
no
explanations
or
apology
were
acceptable
it
was
useless
to
urge
that
it
was
accidental
the
feud
between
bingo
and
oliver
was
now
remembered
as
an
important
sidelight
the
was
thrown
up
all
friendly
relations
ceased
and
to
this
day
there
is
no
county
big
enough
to
hold
the
rival
factions
which
were
called
at
once
into
existence
and
to
arms
by
curley
dying
yell
it
was
months
before
bingo
really
recovered
from
the
poison
we
believed
indeed
that
he
never
again
would
be
the
sturdy
bingo
but
when
the
spring
came
he
began
to
gain
strength
and
bettering
as
the
grass
grew
he
was
within
a
few
weeks
once
more
in
full
health
and
vigor
to
be
a
pride
to
his
friends
and
a
nuisance
to
his
neighbors
vii
changes
took
me
far
away
from
manitoba
and
on
my
return
in
bingo
was
still
a
member
of
wright
household
i
thought
he
would
have
forgotten
me
after
two
years
absence
but
not
so
one
day
early
in
the
winter
after
having
been
lost
for
hours
he
crawled
home
to
wright
with
a
and
a
heavy
log
fast
to
one
foot
and
the
foot
frozen
to
stony
hardness
no
one
had
been
able
to
approach
to
help
him
he
was
so
savage
when
i
the
stranger
now
stooped
down
and
laid
hold
of
the
trap
with
one
hand
and
his
leg
with
the
other
instantly
he
seized
my
wrist
in
his
teeth
without
stirring
i
said
bing
do
you
know
me
he
had
not
broken
the
skin
and
at
once
released
his
hold
and
offered
no
further
resistance
although
he
whined
a
good
deal
during
the
removal
of
the
trap
he
still
acknowledged
me
his
master
in
spite
of
his
change
of
residence
and
my
long
absence
and
notwithstanding
my
surrender
of
ownership
i
still
felt
that
he
was
my
dog
bing
was
carried
into
the
house
much
against
his
will
and
his
frozen
foot
thawed
out
during
the
rest
of
the
winter
he
went
lame
and
two
of
his
toes
eventually
dropped
off
but
before
the
return
of
warm
weather
his
health
and
strength
were
fully
restored
and
to
a
casual
glance
he
bore
no
mark
of
his
dreadful
experience
in
the
steel
trap
viii
during
that
same
winter
i
caught
many
wolves
and
foxes
who
did
not
have
bingo
good
luck
in
escaping
the
traps
which
i
kept
out
right
into
the
spring
for
bounties
are
good
even
when
fur
is
not
kennedy
plain
was
always
a
good
trapping
ground
because
it
was
unfrequented
by
man
and
yet
lay
between
the
heavy
woods
and
the
settlement
i
had
been
fortunate
with
the
fur
here
and
late
in
april
rode
in
on
one
of
my
regular
rounds
the
are
made
of
heavy
steel
and
have
two
springs
each
of
one
hundred
pounds
power
they
are
set
in
fours
around
a
buried
bait
and
after
being
strongly
fastened
to
concealed
logs
are
carefully
covered
in
cotton
and
in
fine
sand
so
as
to
be
quite
invisible
a
prairie
wolf
was
caught
in
one
of
these
i
killed
him
with
a
club
and
throwing
him
aside
proceeded
to
reset
the
trap
as
i
had
done
so
many
hundred
times
before
all
was
quickly
done
i
threw
the
over
toward
the
pony
and
seeing
some
fine
sand
nearby
i
reached
out
for
a
handful
of
it
to
add
a
good
finish
to
the
setting
oh
unlucky
thought
oh
mad
heedlessness
born
of
long
immunity
that
fine
sand
was
on
the
next
wolftrap
and
in
an
instant
i
was
a
prisoner
although
not
wounded
for
the
traps
have
no
teeth
and
my
thick
trapping
gloves
deadened
the
snap
i
was
firmly
caught
across
the
hand
above
the
knuckles
not
greatly
alarmed
at
this
i
tried
to
reach
the
with
my
right
foot
stretching
out
at
full
length
face
downward
i
worked
myself
toward
it
making
my
imprisoned
arm
as
long
and
straight
as
possible
i
could
not
see
and
reach
at
the
same
time
but
counted
on
my
toe
telling
me
when
i
touched
the
little
iron
key
to
my
fetters
my
first
effort
was
a
failure
strain
as
i
might
at
the
chain
my
toe
struck
no
metal
i
swung
slowly
around
my
anchor
but
still
failed
then
a
painfully
taken
observation
showed
i
was
much
too
far
to
the
west
i
set
about
working
around
tapping
blindly
with
my
toe
to
discover
the
key
thus
wildly
groping
with
my
right
foot
i
forgot
about
the
other
till
there
was
a
sharp
and
the
iron
jaws
of
trap
no
closed
tight
on
my
left
foot
the
terrors
of
the
situation
did
not
at
first
impress
me
but
i
soon
found
that
all
my
struggles
were
in
vain
i
could
not
get
free
from
either
trap
or
move
the
traps
together
and
there
i
lay
stretched
out
and
firmly
staked
to
the
ground
what
would
become
of
me
now
there
was
not
much
danger
of
freezing
for
the
cold
weather
was
over
but
kennedy
plain
was
never
visited
by
the
winter
no
one
knew
where
i
had
gone
and
unless
i
could
manage
to
free
myself
there
was
no
prospect
ahead
but
to
be
devoured
by
wolves
or
else
die
of
cold
and
starvation
as
i
lay
there
the
red
sun
went
down
over
the
spruce
swamp
west
of
the
plain
and
a
shorelark
on
a
gopher
mound
a
few
yards
off
twittered
his
evening
song
just
as
one
had
done
the
night
before
at
our
shanty
door
and
though
the
numb
pains
were
creeping
up
my
arm
and
a
deadly
chill
possessed
me
i
noticed
how
long
his
little
were
then
my
thoughts
went
to
the
comfortable
at
wright
shanty
and
i
thought
now
they
are
frying
the
pork
for
supper
or
just
sitting
down
my
pony
still
stood
as
i
left
him
with
his
bridle
on
the
ground
patiently
waiting
to
take
me
home
he
did
not
understand
the
long
delay
and
when
i
called
he
ceased
nibbling
the
grass
and
looked
at
me
in
dumb
helpless
inquiry
if
he
would
only
go
home
the
empty
saddle
might
tell
the
tale
and
bring
help
but
his
very
faithfulness
kept
him
waiting
hour
after
hour
while
i
was
perishing
of
cold
and
hunger
then
i
remembered
how
old
girou
the
trapper
had
been
lost
and
in
the
following
spring
his
comrades
found
his
skeleton
held
by
the
leg
in
a
i
wondered
which
part
of
my
clothing
would
show
my
identity
then
a
new
thought
came
to
me
this
is
how
a
wolf
feels
when
he
is
trapped
oh
what
misery
have
i
been
responsible
for
now
i
to
pay
for
it
night
came
slowly
on
a
prairie
wolf
howled
the
pony
pricked
up
his
ears
and
walking
nearer
to
me
stood
with
his
head
down
then
another
prairie
wolf
howled
and
another
and
i
could
make
out
that
they
were
gathering
in
the
neighborhood
there
i
lay
prone
and
helpless
wondering
if
it
would
not
be
strictly
just
that
they
should
come
and
tear
me
to
pieces
i
heard
them
calling
for
a
long
time
before
i
realized
that
dim
shadowy
forms
were
sneaking
near
the
horse
saw
them
first
and
his
terrified
snort
drove
them
back
at
first
but
they
came
nearer
next
time
and
sat
around
me
on
the
prairie
soon
one
bolder
than
the
others
crawled
up
and
tugged
at
the
body
of
his
dead
relative
i
shouted
and
he
retreated
growling
the
pony
ran
to
a
distance
in
terror
presently
the
wolf
returned
and
after
after
two
or
three
of
these
retreats
and
returns
the
body
was
dragged
off
and
devoured
by
the
rest
in
a
few
minutes
after
this
they
gathered
nearer
and
sat
on
their
haunches
to
look
at
me
and
the
boldest
one
smelt
the
rifle
and
scratched
dirt
on
it
he
retreated
when
i
kicked
at
him
with
my
free
foot
and
shouted
but
growing
bolder
as
i
grew
weaker
he
came
and
snarled
right
in
my
face
at
this
several
others
snarled
and
came
up
closer
and
i
realized
that
i
was
to
be
devoured
by
the
foe
that
i
most
despised
when
suddenly
out
of
the
gloom
with
a
guttural
roar
sprang
a
great
black
wolf
the
prairie
wolves
scattered
like
chaff
except
the
bold
one
which
seized
by
the
black
was
in
a
few
moments
a
draggled
corpse
and
then
oh
horrors
this
mighty
brute
bounded
at
me
and
bingo
noble
bingo
rubbed
his
shaggy
panting
sides
against
me
and
licked
my
cold
face
bingo
bing
old
boy
fetch
me
the
trap
wrench
away
he
went
and
returned
dragging
the
rifle
for
he
knew
only
that
i
wanted
something
no
bing
the
this
time
it
was
my
sash
but
at
last
he
brought
the
wrench
and
wagged
his
tail
in
joy
that
it
was
right
reaching
out
with
my
free
hand
after
much
difficulty
i
unscrewed
the
the
trap
fell
apart
and
my
hand
was
released
and
a
minute
later
i
was
free
bing
brought
the
pony
up
and
after
slowly
walking
to
restore
the
circulation
i
was
able
to
mount
then
slowly
at
first
but
soon
at
a
gallop
with
bingo
as
herald
careering
and
barking
ahead
we
set
out
for
home
there
to
learn
that
the
night
before
though
never
taken
on
the
trapping
rounds
the
brave
dog
had
acted
strangely
whimpering
and
watching
the
and
at
last
when
night
came
on
in
spite
of
attempts
to
detain
him
he
had
set
out
in
the
gloom
and
guided
by
a
knowledge
that
is
beyond
us
had
reached
the
spot
in
time
to
avenge
me
as
well
as
set
me
free
staunch
old
bing
he
was
a
strange
dog
though
his
heart
was
with
me
he
passed
me
next
day
with
scarcely
a
look
but
responded
with
alacrity
when
little
gordon
called
him
to
a
and
it
was
so
to
the
end
and
to
the
end
also
he
lived
the
wolfish
life
that
he
loved
and
never
failed
to
seek
the
horses
and
found
one
again
with
a
poisoned
bait
and
wolfishly
bolted
that
then
feeling
the
pang
set
out
not
for
wright
but
to
find
me
and
reached
the
door
of
my
shanty
where
i
should
have
been
next
day
on
returning
i
found
him
dead
in
the
snow
with
his
head
on
the
sill
of
the
door
the
door
of
his
days
my
dog
to
the
last
in
his
heart
of
hearts
it
was
my
help
he
sought
and
vainly
sought
in
the
hour
of
his
bitter
extremity
the
springfield
fox
i
the
hens
had
been
mysteriously
disappearing
for
over
a
month
and
when
i
came
home
to
springfield
for
the
summer
holidays
it
was
my
duty
to
find
the
cause
this
was
soon
done
the
fowls
were
carried
away
bodily
one
at
a
time
before
going
to
roost
or
else
after
leaving
which
put
tramps
and
neighbors
out
of
court
they
were
not
taken
from
the
high
perches
which
cleared
all
coons
and
owls
or
left
partly
eaten
so
that
weasels
skunks
or
minks
were
not
the
guilty
ones
and
the
blame
therefore
was
surely
left
at
reynard
door
the
great
pine
wood
of
erindale
was
on
the
other
bank
of
the
river
and
on
looking
carefully
about
the
lower
ford
i
saw
a
few
and
a
barred
feather
from
one
of
our
plymouth
rock
chickens
on
climbing
the
farther
bank
in
search
of
more
clews
i
heard
a
great
outcry
of
crows
behind
me
and
turning
saw
a
number
of
these
birds
darting
down
at
something
in
the
ford
a
better
view
showed
that
it
was
the
old
story
thief
catch
thief
for
there
in
the
middle
of
the
ford
was
a
fox
with
something
in
his
jaws
he
was
returning
from
our
barnyard
with
another
hen
the
crows
though
shameless
robbers
themselves
are
ever
first
to
cry
thief
and
yet
more
than
ready
to
take
in
the
form
of
a
share
in
the
plunder
and
this
was
their
game
now
the
fox
to
get
back
home
must
cross
the
river
where
he
was
exposed
to
the
full
brunt
of
the
crow
mob
he
made
a
dash
for
it
and
would
doubtless
have
gotten
across
with
his
booty
had
i
not
joined
in
the
attack
whereupon
he
dropped
the
hen
scarce
dead
and
disappeared
in
the
woods
this
large
and
regular
levy
of
provisions
wholly
carried
off
could
mean
but
one
thing
a
family
of
little
foxes
at
home
and
to
find
them
i
now
was
bound
that
evening
i
went
with
ranger
my
hound
across
the
river
into
the
erindale
woods
as
soon
as
the
hound
began
to
circle
we
heard
the
short
sharp
bark
of
a
fox
from
a
thickly
wooded
ravine
close
by
ranger
dashed
in
at
once
struck
a
hot
scent
and
went
off
on
a
lively
till
his
voice
was
lost
in
the
distance
away
over
the
upland
after
nearly
an
hour
he
came
back
panting
and
warm
for
it
was
baking
august
weather
and
lay
down
at
my
feet
but
almost
immediately
the
same
foxy
yurrr
was
heard
close
at
hand
and
off
dashed
the
dog
on
another
chase
away
he
went
in
the
darkness
baying
like
a
foghorn
straight
away
to
the
north
and
the
loud
boo
became
a
low
oo
and
that
a
feeble
and
then
was
lost
they
must
have
gone
some
miles
away
for
even
with
ear
to
the
ground
i
heard
nothing
of
them
though
a
mile
was
easy
distance
for
ranger
brazen
voice
as
i
waited
in
the
black
woods
i
heard
a
sweet
sound
of
dripping
water
tank
tenk
tink
ta
tink
tank
tenk
tonk
i
did
not
know
of
any
spring
so
near
and
in
the
hot
night
it
was
a
glad
find
but
the
sound
led
me
to
the
bough
of
a
where
i
found
its
source
such
a
soft
sweet
song
full
of
delightful
suggestion
on
such
a
night
tonk
tank
tenk
tink
ta
tink
a
tonk
a
tank
a
tink
a
ta
ta
tink
tank
ta
ta
tonk
tink
drink
a
tank
a
drink
a
drunk
it
was
the
song
of
the
owl
but
suddenly
a
deep
raucous
breathing
and
a
rustle
of
leaves
showed
that
ranger
was
back
he
was
completely
fagged
out
his
tongue
hung
almost
to
the
ground
and
was
dripping
with
foam
his
flanks
were
heaving
and
dribbled
from
his
breast
and
sides
he
stopped
panting
a
moment
to
give
my
hand
a
dutiful
lick
then
flung
himself
flop
on
the
leaves
to
drown
all
other
sounds
with
his
noisy
panting
but
again
that
tantilizing
yurrr
was
heard
a
few
feet
away
and
the
meaning
of
it
all
dawned
on
me
we
were
close
to
the
den
where
the
little
foxes
were
and
the
old
ones
were
taking
turns
in
trying
to
lead
us
away
it
was
late
night
now
so
we
went
home
feeling
sure
that
the
problem
was
nearly
solved
ii
it
was
well
known
that
there
was
an
old
fox
with
his
family
living
in
the
neighborhood
but
no
one
supposed
them
so
near
this
fox
had
been
called
because
of
a
scar
reaching
from
his
eye
through
and
back
of
his
ear
this
was
supposed
to
have
been
given
him
by
a
fence
during
a
rabbit
hunt
and
as
the
hair
came
in
white
after
it
healed
it
was
always
a
strong
mark
the
winter
before
i
had
met
with
him
and
had
had
a
sample
of
his
craftiness
i
was
out
shooting
after
a
fall
of
snow
and
had
crossed
the
open
fields
to
the
edge
of
the
brushy
hollow
back
of
the
old
mill
as
my
head
rose
to
a
view
of
the
hollow
i
caught
sight
of
a
fox
trotting
at
long
range
down
the
other
side
in
line
to
cross
my
course
instantly
i
held
motionless
and
did
not
even
lower
or
turn
my
head
lest
i
should
catch
his
eye
by
moving
until
he
went
on
out
of
sight
in
the
thick
cover
at
the
bottom
as
soon
as
he
was
hidden
i
bobbed
down
and
ran
to
head
him
off
where
he
should
leave
the
cover
on
the
other
side
and
was
there
in
good
time
awaiting
but
no
fox
came
forth
a
careful
look
showed
the
fresh
track
of
a
fox
that
had
bounded
from
the
cover
and
following
it
with
my
eye
i
saw
old
scarface
himself
far
out
of
range
behind
me
sitting
on
his
haunches
and
grinning
as
though
much
amused
a
study
of
the
trail
made
all
clear
he
had
seen
me
at
the
moment
i
saw
him
but
he
also
like
a
true
hunter
had
concealed
the
fact
putting
on
an
air
of
unconcern
till
out
of
sight
when
he
had
run
for
his
life
around
behind
me
and
amused
himself
by
watching
my
trick
in
the
springtime
i
had
yet
another
instance
of
scarface
cunning
i
was
walking
with
a
friend
along
the
road
over
the
high
pasture
we
passed
within
thirty
feet
of
a
ridge
on
which
were
several
gray
and
brown
boulders
when
at
the
nearest
point
my
friend
said
stone
number
three
looks
to
me
very
much
like
a
fox
curled
up
but
i
could
not
see
it
and
we
passed
we
had
not
gone
many
yards
farther
when
the
wind
blew
on
this
boulder
as
on
fur
my
friend
said
i
am
sure
that
is
a
fox
lying
asleep
we
soon
settle
that
i
replied
and
turned
back
but
as
soon
as
i
had
taken
one
step
from
the
road
up
jumped
scarface
for
it
was
he
and
ran
a
fire
had
swept
the
middle
of
the
pasture
leaving
a
broad
belt
of
black
over
this
he
scurried
till
he
came
to
the
unburnt
yellow
grass
again
where
he
squatted
down
and
was
lost
to
view
he
had
been
watching
us
all
the
time
and
would
not
have
moved
had
we
kept
to
the
road
the
wonderful
part
of
this
is
not
that
he
resembled
the
round
stones
and
dry
grass
but
that
he
knew
he
did
and
was
ready
to
profit
by
it
we
soon
found
that
it
was
scarface
and
his
wife
vixen
that
had
made
our
woods
their
home
and
our
barnyard
their
base
of
supplies
next
morning
a
search
in
the
pines
showed
a
great
bank
of
earth
that
had
been
scratched
up
within
a
few
months
it
must
have
come
from
a
hole
and
yet
there
was
none
to
be
seen
it
is
well
known
that
a
really
cute
fox
on
digging
a
new
den
brings
all
the
earth
out
at
the
first
hole
made
but
carries
on
a
tunnel
into
some
distant
thicket
then
closing
up
for
good
the
first
made
and
too
door
uses
only
the
entrance
hidden
in
the
thicket
so
after
a
little
search
at
the
other
side
of
a
knoll
i
found
the
real
entry
and
good
proof
that
there
was
a
nest
of
little
foxes
inside
rising
above
the
brush
on
the
hillside
was
a
great
hollow
basswood
it
leaned
a
good
deal
and
had
a
large
hole
at
the
bottom
and
a
smaller
one
at
top
we
boys
had
often
used
this
tree
in
playing
swiss
family
robinson
and
by
cutting
steps
in
its
soft
punky
walls
had
made
it
easy
to
go
up
and
down
in
the
hollow
now
it
came
in
handy
for
next
day
when
the
sun
was
warm
i
went
there
to
watch
and
from
this
perch
on
the
roof
i
soon
saw
the
interesting
family
that
lived
in
the
cellar
near
by
there
were
four
little
foxes
they
looked
curiously
like
little
lambs
with
their
woolly
coats
their
long
thick
legs
and
innocent
expressions
and
yet
a
second
glance
at
their
broad
visages
showed
that
each
of
these
innocents
was
the
makings
of
a
crafty
old
fox
they
played
about
basking
in
the
sun
or
wrestling
with
each
other
till
a
slight
sound
made
them
scurry
under
ground
but
their
alarm
was
needless
for
the
cause
of
it
was
their
mother
she
stepped
from
the
bushes
bringing
another
hen
number
seventeen
as
i
remember
a
low
call
from
her
and
the
little
fellows
came
tumbling
out
then
began
a
scene
that
i
thought
charming
but
which
my
uncle
would
not
have
enjoyed
at
all
they
rushed
on
the
hen
and
tussled
and
fought
with
it
and
each
other
while
the
mother
keeping
a
sharp
eye
for
enemies
looked
on
with
fond
delight
the
expression
on
her
face
was
remarkable
it
was
first
a
grinning
of
delight
but
her
usual
look
of
wildness
and
cunning
was
there
nor
were
cruelty
and
nervousness
lacking
but
over
all
was
the
unmistakable
look
of
the
mother
pride
and
love
the
base
of
my
tree
was
hidden
in
bushes
and
much
lower
than
the
knoll
where
the
den
was
so
i
could
come
and
go
at
will
without
scaring
the
foxes
for
many
days
i
went
there
and
saw
much
of
the
training
of
the
young
ones
they
early
learned
to
turn
to
statuettes
sound
and
then
on
hearing
it
again
or
finding
other
cause
for
fear
to
run
for
shelter
some
animals
have
so
much
that
it
overflows
and
benefits
outsiders
not
so
old
vixen
it
would
seem
her
pleasure
in
the
cubs
led
to
most
refined
cruelty
for
she
often
brought
home
to
them
mice
and
birds
alive
and
with
diabolic
gentleness
would
avoid
doing
them
serious
hurt
so
that
the
cubs
might
have
larger
scope
to
torment
them
there
was
a
woodchuck
that
lived
over
in
the
hill
orchard
he
was
neither
handsome
nor
interesting
but
he
knew
how
to
take
care
of
himself
he
had
dug
a
den
between
the
roots
of
an
old
pine
stump
so
that
the
foxes
could
not
follow
him
by
digging
but
hard
work
was
not
their
way
of
life
wits
they
believed
worth
more
then
elbowgrease
this
woodchuck
usually
sunned
himself
on
the
stump
each
morning
if
he
saw
a
fox
near
he
went
down
in
the
door
of
his
den
or
if
the
enemy
was
very
near
he
went
inside
and
stayed
long
enough
for
the
danger
to
pass
one
morning
vixen
and
her
mate
seemed
to
decide
that
it
was
time
the
children
knew
something
about
the
broad
subject
of
woodchucks
and
further
that
this
orchard
woodchuck
would
serve
nicely
for
an
so
they
went
together
to
the
unseen
by
old
chuckie
on
his
stump
scarface
then
showed
himself
in
the
orchard
and
quietly
walked
in
a
line
so
as
to
pass
by
the
stump
at
a
distance
but
never
once
turned
his
head
or
allowed
the
woodchuck
to
think
himself
seen
when
the
fox
entered
the
field
the
woodchuck
quietly
dropped
down
to
the
mouth
of
his
den
here
he
waited
as
the
fox
passed
but
concluding
that
after
all
wisdom
is
the
better
part
went
into
his
hole
this
was
what
the
foxes
wanted
vixen
had
kept
out
of
sight
but
now
ran
swiftly
to
the
stump
and
hid
behind
it
scarface
had
kept
straight
on
going
very
slowly
the
woodchuck
had
not
been
frightened
so
before
long
his
head
popped
up
between
the
roots
and
he
looked
around
there
was
that
fox
still
going
on
farther
and
farther
away
the
woodchuck
grew
bold
as
the
fox
went
and
came
out
farther
and
then
seeing
the
coast
clear
he
scrambled
onto
the
stump
and
with
one
spring
vixen
had
him
and
shook
him
till
he
lay
senseless
scarface
had
watched
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
and
now
came
running
back
but
vixen
took
the
chuck
in
her
jaws
and
made
for
the
den
so
he
saw
he
was
needed
back
to
the
den
came
vix
and
carried
the
chuck
so
carefully
that
he
was
able
to
struggle
a
little
when
she
got
there
a
low
at
the
den
brought
the
little
fellows
out
like
schoolboys
to
play
she
threw
the
wounded
animal
to
them
and
they
set
on
him
like
four
little
furies
uttering
little
growls
and
biting
little
bites
with
all
the
strength
of
their
baby
jaws
but
the
woodchuck
fought
for
his
life
and
beating
them
off
slowly
hobbled
to
the
shelter
of
a
thicket
the
little
ones
pursued
like
a
pack
of
hounds
and
dragged
at
his
tail
and
flanks
but
could
not
hold
him
back
so
vixen
overtook
him
with
a
couple
of
bounds
and
dragged
him
again
into
the
open
for
the
children
to
worry
again
and
again
this
rough
sport
went
on
till
one
of
the
little
ones
was
badly
bitten
and
his
squeal
of
pain
roused
vix
to
end
the
woodchuck
misery
and
serve
him
up
at
once
not
far
from
the
den
was
a
hollow
overgrown
with
coarse
grass
the
playground
of
a
colony
of
the
earliest
lesson
in
woodcraft
that
the
little
ones
took
away
from
the
den
was
in
this
hollow
here
they
had
their
first
course
of
mice
the
easiest
of
all
game
in
teaching
the
main
thing
was
example
aided
by
a
instinct
the
old
fox
also
had
one
or
two
signs
meaning
lie
still
and
watch
come
do
as
i
do
and
so
on
that
were
much
used
so
the
merry
lot
went
to
this
hollow
one
calm
evening
and
mother
fox
made
them
lie
still
in
the
grass
presently
a
faint
squeak
showed
that
the
game
was
astir
vix
rose
up
and
went
on
tiptoe
into
the
grass
not
crouching
but
as
high
as
she
could
stand
sometimes
on
her
hind
legs
so
as
to
get
a
better
view
the
runs
that
the
mice
follow
are
hidden
under
the
grass
tangle
and
the
only
way
to
know
the
whereabouts
of
a
mouse
is
by
seeing
the
slight
shaking
of
the
grass
which
is
the
reason
why
mice
are
hunted
only
on
calm
days
and
the
trick
is
to
locate
the
mouse
and
seize
him
first
and
see
him
afterward
vix
soon
made
a
spring
and
in
the
middle
of
the
bunch
of
dead
grass
that
she
grabbed
was
a
squeaking
his
last
squeak
he
was
soon
gobbled
and
the
four
awkward
little
foxes
tried
to
do
the
same
as
their
mother
and
when
at
length
the
eldest
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
caught
game
he
quivered
with
excitement
and
ground
his
pearly
little
into
the
mouse
with
a
rush
of
inborn
savageness
that
must
have
surprised
even
himself
another
home
lesson
was
on
the
one
of
these
noisy
vulgar
creatures
lived
close
by
and
used
to
waste
part
of
each
day
scolding
the
foxes
from
some
safe
perch
the
cubs
made
many
vain
attempts
to
catch
him
as
he
ran
across
their
glade
from
one
tree
to
an
other
or
spluttered
and
scolded
at
them
a
foot
or
so
out
of
reach
but
old
vixen
was
up
in
natural
history
she
knew
squirrel
nature
and
took
the
case
in
hand
when
the
proper
time
came
she
hid
the
children
and
lay
down
flat
in
the
middle
of
the
open
glade
the
saucy
squirrel
came
and
scolded
as
usual
but
she
moved
no
hair
he
came
nearer
and
at
last
right
over
head
to
chatter
you
brute
you
you
brute
you
but
vix
lay
as
dead
this
was
very
perplexing
so
the
squirrel
came
down
the
trunk
and
peeping
about
made
a
nervous
dash
across
the
grass
to
another
tree
again
to
scold
from
a
safe
perch
you
brute
you
you
useless
brute
but
flat
and
lifeless
on
the
grass
lay
vix
this
was
most
tantilizing
to
the
squirrel
he
was
naturally
curious
and
disposed
to
be
venturesome
so
again
he
came
to
the
ground
and
scurried
across
the
glade
nearer
than
before
still
as
death
lay
vix
surely
she
was
dead
and
the
little
foxes
began
to
wonder
if
their
mother
was
asleep
but
the
squirrel
was
working
himself
into
a
little
craze
of
foolhardy
curiosity
he
had
dropped
a
piece
of
bark
on
vix
head
he
had
used
up
his
list
of
bad
words
and
he
had
done
it
all
over
again
without
getting
a
sign
of
life
so
after
a
couple
more
dashes
across
the
glade
he
ventured
within
a
few
feet
of
the
really
watchful
vix
who
sprang
to
her
feet
and
pinned
him
in
a
twinkling
and
the
little
ones
picked
the
bones
thus
the
rudiments
of
their
education
were
laid
and
afterward
as
they
grew
stronger
they
were
taken
farther
afield
to
begin
the
higher
branches
of
trailing
and
scenting
for
each
kind
of
prey
they
were
taught
a
way
to
hunt
for
every
animal
has
some
great
strength
or
it
could
not
live
and
some
great
weakness
or
the
others
could
not
live
the
squirrel
weakness
was
foolish
curiosity
the
fox
that
he
ca
climb
a
tree
and
the
training
of
the
little
foxes
was
all
shaped
to
take
advantage
of
the
weakness
of
the
other
creatures
and
to
make
up
for
their
own
by
defter
play
where
they
are
strong
from
their
parents
they
learned
the
chief
axioms
of
the
fox
world
how
is
not
easy
to
say
but
that
they
learned
this
in
company
with
their
parents
was
clear
here
are
some
that
foxes
taught
me
without
saying
a
word
never
sleep
on
your
straight
track
your
nose
is
before
your
eyes
then
trust
it
first
a
fool
runs
down
the
wind
running
rills
cure
many
ills
never
take
the
open
if
you
can
keep
the
cover
never
leave
a
straight
trail
if
a
crooked
one
will
do
if
it
strange
it
hostile
dust
and
water
burn
the
scent
never
hunt
mice
in
a
or
rabbits
in
a
henyard
keep
off
the
grass
inklings
of
the
meanings
of
these
were
already
entering
the
little
minds
thus
follow
what
you
ca
smell
was
wise
they
could
see
because
if
you
ca
smell
it
then
the
wind
is
so
that
it
must
smell
you
one
by
one
they
learned
the
birds
and
beasts
of
their
home
woods
and
then
as
they
were
able
to
go
abroad
with
their
parents
they
learned
new
animals
they
were
beginning
to
think
they
knew
the
scent
of
everything
that
moved
but
one
night
the
mother
took
them
to
a
field
where
there
was
a
strange
black
flat
thing
on
the
ground
she
brought
them
on
purpose
to
smell
it
but
at
the
first
whiff
their
every
hair
stood
on
end
they
trembled
they
knew
not
why
it
seemed
to
tingle
through
their
blood
and
fill
them
with
instinctive
hate
and
fear
and
when
she
saw
its
full
effect
she
told
them
that
is
iii
meanwhile
the
hens
continued
to
disappear
i
had
not
betrayed
the
den
of
cubs
indeed
i
thought
a
good
deal
more
of
the
little
rascals
than
i
did
of
the
hens
but
uncle
was
dreadfully
wrought
up
and
made
most
disparaging
remarks
about
my
woodcraft
to
please
him
i
one
day
took
the
hound
across
to
the
woods
and
seating
myself
on
a
stump
on
the
open
hillside
i
bade
the
dog
go
on
within
three
minutes
he
sang
out
in
the
tongue
all
hunters
know
so
well
fox
fox
fox
straight
away
down
the
valley
after
awhile
i
heard
them
coming
back
there
i
saw
the
fox
scarface
loping
lightly
across
the
to
the
stream
in
he
went
and
trotted
along
in
the
shallow
water
near
the
margin
for
two
hundred
yards
then
came
out
straight
toward
me
though
in
full
view
he
saw
me
not
but
came
up
the
hill
watching
over
his
shoulder
for
the
hound
within
ten
feet
of
me
he
turned
and
sat
with
his
back
to
me
while
he
craned
his
neck
and
showed
an
eager
interest
in
the
doings
of
the
hound
ranger
came
bawling
along
the
trail
till
he
came
to
the
running
water
the
killer
of
scent
and
here
he
was
puzzled
but
there
was
only
one
thing
to
do
that
was
by
going
up
and
down
both
banks
find
where
the
fox
had
left
the
river
the
fox
before
me
shifted
his
position
a
little
to
get
a
better
view
and
watched
with
a
most
human
interest
all
the
circling
of
the
hound
he
was
so
close
that
i
saw
the
hair
of
his
shoulder
bristle
a
little
when
the
dog
came
in
sight
i
could
see
the
jumping
of
his
heart
on
his
ribs
and
the
gleam
of
his
yellow
eye
when
the
dog
was
wholly
baulked
by
the
water
trick
it
was
comical
to
see
he
could
not
sit
still
but
rocked
up
and
down
in
glee
and
reared
on
his
hind
feet
to
get
a
better
view
of
the
hound
with
mouth
opened
nearly
to
his
ears
though
not
at
all
winded
he
panted
noisily
for
a
moment
or
rather
he
laughed
gleefully
just
as
a
dog
laughs
by
grinning
and
panting
old
scarface
wriggled
in
huge
enjoyment
as
the
hound
puzzled
over
the
trail
so
long
that
when
he
did
find
it
it
was
so
stale
he
could
barely
follow
it
and
did
not
feel
justified
in
tonguing
on
it
at
all
as
soon
as
the
hound
was
working
up
the
hill
the
fox
quietly
went
into
the
woods
i
had
been
sitting
in
plain
view
only
ten
feet
away
but
i
had
the
wind
and
kept
still
and
the
fox
never
knew
that
his
life
had
for
twenty
minutes
been
in
the
power
of
the
foe
he
most
feared
ranger
also
would
have
passed
me
as
near
as
the
fox
but
i
spoke
to
him
and
with
a
little
nervous
start
he
quit
the
trail
and
looking
sheepish
lay
down
by
my
feet
this
little
comedy
was
played
with
variations
for
several
days
but
it
was
all
in
plain
view
from
the
house
across
the
river
my
uncle
impatient
at
the
daily
loss
of
hens
went
out
himself
sat
on
the
open
knoll
and
when
old
scarface
trotted
to
his
lookout
to
watch
the
dull
hound
on
the
river
flat
below
my
uncle
remorselessly
shot
him
in
the
back
at
the
very
moment
when
he
was
grinning
over
a
new
triumph
iv
but
still
the
hens
were
disappearing
my
uncle
was
wrathy
he
determined
to
conduct
the
war
himself
and
sowed
the
woods
with
poison
baits
trusting
to
luck
that
our
own
dogs
would
not
get
them
he
indulged
in
contemptuous
remarks
on
my
woodcraft
and
went
out
evenings
with
a
gun
and
the
two
dogs
to
see
what
he
could
destroy
vix
knew
right
well
what
a
poisoned
bait
was
she
passed
them
by
or
else
treated
them
with
active
contempt
but
one
she
dropped
down
the
hole
of
an
old
enemy
a
skunk
who
was
never
afterward
seen
formerly
old
scarface
was
always
ready
to
take
charge
of
the
dogs
and
keep
them
out
of
mischief
but
now
that
vix
had
the
whole
burden
of
the
brood
she
could
no
longer
spend
time
in
breaking
every
track
to
the
den
and
was
not
always
at
hand
to
meet
and
mislead
the
foes
that
might
be
coming
too
near
the
end
is
easily
foreseen
ranger
followed
a
hot
trail
to
the
den
and
spot
the
announced
that
the
family
was
at
home
and
then
did
his
best
to
go
in
after
them
the
whole
secret
was
now
out
and
the
whole
family
doomed
the
hired
man
came
around
with
pick
and
shovel
to
dig
them
out
while
we
and
the
dogs
stood
by
old
vix
soon
showed
herself
in
the
near
woods
and
led
the
dogs
away
off
down
the
river
where
she
shook
them
off
when
she
thought
proper
by
the
simple
device
of
springing
on
a
sheep
back
the
frightened
animal
ran
for
several
hundred
yards
then
vix
got
off
knowing
that
there
was
now
a
hopeless
gap
in
the
scent
and
returned
to
the
den
but
the
dogs
baffled
by
the
break
in
the
trail
soon
did
the
same
to
find
vix
hanging
about
in
despair
vainly
trying
to
decoy
us
away
from
her
treasures
meanwhile
paddy
plied
both
pick
and
shovel
with
vigor
and
effect
the
yellow
gravelly
sand
was
heaping
on
both
sides
and
the
shoulders
of
the
sturdy
digger
were
sinking
below
the
level
after
an
hour
digging
enlivened
by
frantic
rushes
of
the
dogs
after
the
old
fox
who
hovered
near
in
the
woods
pat
called
here
they
are
sot
it
was
the
den
at
the
end
of
the
burrow
and
cowering
as
far
back
as
they
could
were
the
four
little
woolly
cubs
before
i
could
interfere
a
murderous
blow
from
the
shovel
and
a
sudden
rush
for
the
fierce
little
terrier
ended
the
lives
of
three
the
fourth
and
smallest
was
barely
saved
by
holding
him
by
his
tail
high
out
of
reach
of
the
excited
dogs
he
gave
one
short
squeal
and
his
poor
mother
came
at
the
cry
and
circled
so
near
that
she
would
have
been
shot
but
for
the
accidental
protection
of
the
dogs
who
somehow
always
seemed
to
get
between
and
whom
she
once
more
led
away
on
a
fruitless
chase
the
little
one
saved
alive
was
dropped
into
a
bag
where
he
lay
quite
still
his
unfortunate
brothers
were
thrown
back
into
their
nursery
bed
and
buried
under
a
few
shovelfuls
of
earth
we
guilty
ones
then
went
back
into
the
house
and
the
little
fox
was
soon
chained
in
the
yard
no
one
knew
just
why
he
was
kept
alive
but
in
all
a
change
of
feeling
had
set
in
and
the
idea
of
killing
him
was
without
a
supporter
he
was
a
pretty
little
fellow
like
a
cross
between
a
fox
and
a
lamb
his
woolly
visage
and
form
were
strangely
and
innocent
but
one
could
find
in
his
yellow
eyes
a
gleam
of
cunning
and
savageness
as
as
it
possibly
could
be
as
long
as
anyone
was
near
he
crouched
sullen
and
cowed
in
his
and
it
was
a
full
hour
after
being
left
alone
before
he
ventured
to
look
out
my
window
now
took
the
place
of
the
hollow
bass
wood
a
number
of
hens
of
the
breed
he
knew
so
well
were
about
the
cub
in
the
yard
late
that
afternoon
as
they
strayed
near
the
captive
there
was
a
sudden
rattle
of
the
chain
and
the
youngster
dashed
at
the
nearest
one
and
would
have
caught
him
but
for
the
chain
which
brought
him
up
with
a
jerk
he
got
on
his
feet
and
slunk
back
to
his
box
and
though
he
afterward
made
several
rushes
he
so
gauged
his
leap
as
to
win
or
fail
within
the
length
of
the
chain
and
never
again
was
brought
up
by
its
cruel
jerk
as
night
came
down
the
little
fellow
became
very
uneasy
sneaking
out
of
his
box
but
going
back
at
each
slight
alarm
tugging
at
his
chain
or
at
times
biting
it
in
fury
while
he
held
it
down
with
his
fore
paws
suddenly
he
paused
as
though
listening
then
raising
his
little
black
nose
he
poured
out
a
short
quavering
cry
once
or
twice
this
was
repeated
the
time
between
being
occupied
in
worrying
the
chain
and
running
about
then
an
answer
came
the
of
the
old
fox
a
few
minutes
later
a
shadowy
form
appeared
on
the
the
little
one
slunk
into
his
box
but
at
once
returned
and
ran
to
meet
his
mother
with
all
the
gladness
that
a
fox
could
show
quick
as
a
flash
she
seized
him
and
turned
to
bear
him
away
by
the
road
she
came
but
the
moment
the
end
of
the
chain
was
reached
the
cub
was
rudely
jerked
from
the
old
one
mouth
and
she
scared
by
the
opening
of
a
window
fled
over
the
an
hour
afterward
the
cub
had
ceased
to
run
about
or
cry
i
peeped
out
and
by
the
light
of
the
moon
saw
the
form
of
the
mother
at
full
length
on
the
ground
by
the
little
one
gnawing
at
something
the
clank
of
iron
told
what
it
was
that
cruel
chain
and
tip
the
little
one
meanwhile
was
helping
himself
to
a
warm
drink
on
my
going
out
she
fled
into
the
dark
woods
but
there
by
the
were
two
little
mice
bloody
and
still
warm
food
for
the
cub
brought
by
the
devoted
mother
and
in
the
morning
i
found
the
chain
was
very
bright
for
a
foot
or
two
next
the
little
one
collar
on
walking
across
the
woods
to
the
ruined
den
i
again
found
signs
of
vixen
the
poor
mother
had
come
and
dug
out
the
bedraggled
bodies
of
her
little
ones
there
lay
the
three
little
baby
foxes
all
licked
smooth
now
and
by
them
were
two
of
our
hens
fresh
killed
the
newly
heaved
earth
was
printed
all
over
with
telltale
signs
signs
that
told
me
that
here
by
the
side
of
her
dead
she
had
watched
like
rizpah
here
she
had
brought
their
usual
meal
the
spoil
of
her
nightly
hunt
here
she
had
stretched
herself
beside
them
and
vainly
offered
them
their
natural
drink
and
yearned
to
feed
and
warm
them
as
of
old
but
only
stiff
little
bodies
under
their
soft
wool
she
found
and
little
cold
noses
still
and
unresponsive
a
deep
impress
of
elbows
breasts
and
hocks
showed
where
she
had
laid
in
silent
grief
and
watched
them
for
long
and
mourned
as
a
wild
mother
can
mourn
for
its
young
but
from
that
time
she
came
no
more
to
the
ruined
den
for
now
she
surely
knew
that
her
little
ones
were
dead
tip
the
captive
the
weakling
of
the
brood
was
now
the
heir
to
all
her
love
the
dogs
were
loosed
to
guard
the
hens
the
hired
man
had
orders
to
shoot
the
old
fox
on
sight
so
had
i
but
was
resolved
never
to
see
her
that
a
fox
loves
and
a
dog
will
not
touch
had
been
poisoned
and
scattered
through
the
woods
and
the
only
way
to
the
yard
where
tip
was
tied
was
by
climbing
the
after
braving
all
other
dangers
and
yet
each
night
old
vix
was
there
to
nurse
her
baby
and
bring
it
hens
and
game
again
and
again
i
saw
her
although
she
came
now
without
awaiting
the
querulous
cry
of
the
captive
the
second
night
of
the
captivity
i
heard
the
rattle
of
the
chain
and
then
made
out
that
the
old
fox
was
there
hard
at
work
digging
a
hole
by
the
little
one
kennel
when
it
was
deep
enough
to
half
bury
her
she
gathered
into
it
all
the
slack
of
the
chain
and
filled
it
again
with
earth
then
in
triumph
thinking
she
had
gotten
rid
of
the
chain
she
seized
little
tip
by
the
neck
and
turned
to
dash
off
up
the
but
alas
only
to
have
him
jerked
roughly
from
her
grasp
poor
little
fellow
he
whimpered
sadly
as
he
crawled
into
his
box
after
half
an
hour
there
was
a
great
out
cry
among
the
dogs
and
by
their
tonguing
through
the
far
wood
i
knew
they
were
chasing
vix
away
up
north
they
went
in
the
direction
of
the
railway
and
their
noise
faded
from
hearing
next
morning
the
hound
had
not
come
back
we
soon
knew
why
foxes
long
ago
learned
what
a
railroad
is
they
soon
devised
several
ways
of
turning
it
to
account
one
way
is
when
hunted
to
walk
the
rails
for
a
long
distance
just
before
a
train
comes
the
scent
always
poor
on
iron
is
destroyed
by
the
train
and
there
is
always
a
chance
of
hounds
being
killed
by
the
engine
but
another
way
more
sure
but
harder
to
play
is
to
lead
the
hounds
straight
to
a
high
trestle
just
ahead
of
the
train
so
that
the
engine
overtakes
them
on
it
and
they
are
surely
dashed
to
destruction
this
trick
was
skilfully
played
and
down
below
we
found
the
mangled
remains
of
old
ranger
and
learned
that
vix
was
already
wreaking
her
revenge
that
same
night
she
returned
to
the
yard
before
spot
weary
limbs
could
bring
him
back
and
killed
another
hen
and
brought
it
to
tip
and
stretched
her
panting
length
beside
him
that
he
might
quench
his
thirst
for
she
seemed
to
think
he
had
no
food
but
what
she
brought
it
was
that
hen
that
betrayed
to
my
uncle
the
nightly
visits
my
own
sympathies
were
all
turning
to
vix
and
i
would
have
no
hand
in
planning
further
murders
next
night
my
uncle
himself
watched
gun
in
hand
for
an
hour
then
when
it
became
cold
and
the
moon
clouded
over
he
remembered
other
important
business
elsewhere
and
left
paddy
in
his
place
but
paddy
was
onaisy
as
the
stillness
and
anxiety
of
watching
worked
on
his
nerves
and
the
loud
bang
bang
an
hour
later
left
us
sure
only
that
powder
had
been
burned
in
the
morning
we
found
vix
had
not
failed
her
young
one
again
next
night
found
my
uncle
on
guard
for
another
hen
had
been
taken
soon
after
dark
a
single
shot
was
heard
but
vix
dropped
the
game
she
was
bringing
and
escaped
another
attempt
made
that
night
called
forth
another
gunshot
yet
next
day
it
was
seen
by
the
brightness
of
the
chain
that
she
had
come
again
and
vainly
tried
for
hours
to
cut
that
hateful
bond
such
courage
and
stanch
fidelity
were
bound
to
win
respect
if
not
toleration
at
any
rate
there
was
no
gunner
in
wait
next
night
when
all
was
still
could
it
be
of
any
use
driven
off
thrice
with
gunshots
would
she
make
another
try
to
feed
or
free
her
captive
young
one
would
she
hers
was
a
mother
love
there
was
but
one
to
watch
them
this
time
the
fourth
night
when
the
quavering
whine
of
the
little
one
was
followed
by
that
shadowy
form
above
the
wood
pile
but
carrying
no
fowl
or
food
that
could
be
seen
had
the
keen
huntress
failed
at
last
had
she
no
head
of
game
for
this
her
only
charge
or
had
she
learned
to
trust
his
captors
for
his
food
no
far
from
all
this
the
mother
heart
and
hate
were
true
her
only
thought
had
been
to
set
him
free
all
means
she
knew
she
tried
and
every
danger
braved
to
tend
him
well
and
help
him
to
be
free
but
all
had
failed
like
a
shadow
she
came
and
in
a
moment
was
gone
and
tip
seized
on
something
dropped
and
crunched
and
chewed
with
relish
what
she
brought
but
even
as
he
ate
a
pang
shot
through
and
a
scream
of
pain
escaped
him
then
there
was
a
momentary
struggle
and
the
little
fox
was
dead
the
mother
love
was
strong
in
vix
but
a
higher
thought
was
stronger
she
knew
right
well
the
poison
power
she
knew
the
poison
bait
and
would
have
taught
him
had
he
lived
to
know
and
shun
it
too
but
now
at
last
when
she
must
choose
for
him
a
wretched
prisoner
life
or
sudden
death
she
quenched
the
mother
in
her
breast
and
freed
him
by
the
one
remaining
door
it
is
when
the
snow
is
on
the
ground
that
we
take
the
census
of
the
woods
and
when
the
winter
came
it
told
me
that
vix
no
longer
roamed
the
woods
of
erindale
where
she
went
it
never
told
but
only
this
that
she
was
gone
gone
perhaps
to
some
other
haunt
to
leave
behind
the
sad
remembrance
of
her
murdered
little
ones
and
mate
or
gone
may
be
deliberately
from
the
scene
of
a
sorrowful
life
as
many
a
mother
has
gone
by
the
means
that
she
herself
had
used
to
free
her
young
one
the
last
of
all
her
brood
the
pacing
mustang
i
jo
calone
threw
down
his
saddle
on
the
dusty
ground
turned
his
horses
loose
and
went
clanking
into
the
ranchhouse
nigh
about
chuck
time
he
asked
seventeen
minutes
said
the
cook
glancing
at
the
waterbury
with
the
air
of
a
train
starter
though
this
show
of
precision
had
never
yet
been
justified
by
events
how
things
on
the
perico
said
jo
pard
hinges
said
jo
cattle
seem
lots
of
calves
i
seen
that
bunch
o
mustangs
that
waters
at
antelope
springs

o
colts
along
one
little
dark
one
a
fair
dandy
a

i
run
them
a
mile
or
two
and
he
led
the
bunch

never
broke
his
pace

loose
an
pushed
them

for
fun
an
darned
if
i
could
make

scarth
incredulously
that
all
right
scarth
you
had
to
crawl
on
our
last
bet
an
get
another
chance
soon
as
you
man
enough
chuck
shouted
the
cook
and
the
subject
was
dropped
next
day
the
scene
of
the
roundup
was
changed
and
the
mustangs
were
forgotten
a
year
later
the
same
corner
of
new
mexico
was
worked
over
by
the
roundup
and
again
the
mustang
bunch
was
seen
the
dark
colt
was
now
a
black
yearling
with
thin
clean
legs
and
glossy
flanks
and
more
than
one
of
the
boys
saw
with
his
own
eyes
this
oddity
the
mustang
was
a
born
pacer
jo
was
along
and
the
idea
now
struck
him
that
that
colt
was
worth
having
to
an
easterner
this
thought
may
not
seem
startling
or
original
but
in
the
west
where
an
unbroken
horse
is
worth
and
where
an
ordinary
saddlehorse
is
worth
or
the
idea
of
a
wild
mustang
being
desirable
property
does
not
occur
to
the
average
cowboy
for
mustangs
are
hard
to
catch
and
when
caught
are
merely
wild
animal
prisoners
perfectly
useless
and
untamable
to
the
last
not
a
few
of
the
make
a
point
of
shooting
all
mustangs
at
sight
they
are
not
only
useless
cumberers
of
the
but
commonly
lead
away
domestic
horses
which
soon
take
to
wild
life
and
are
thenceforth
lost
wild
jo
calone
knew
a
right
down
to
subsoil
i
never
seen
a
white
that
was
soft
nor
a
chestnut
that
was
nervous
nor
a
bay
that
was
good
if
broke
right
nor
a
black
that
was
hard
as
nails
an
full
of
the
old
harry
all
a
black
bronk
wants
is
claws
to
be
daniel
hull
outfit
of
lions
since
then
a
mustang
is
worthless
vermin
and
a
black
mustang
ten
times
worse
than
worthless
jo
pard
did
see
no
sense
in
wantin
to
corral
the
yearling
as
he
now
seemed
intent
on
doing
but
jo
got
no
chance
to
try
that
year
he
was
only
a
on
a
month
and
tied
to
hours
like
most
of
the
boys
he
always
looked
forward
to
having
a
ranch
and
an
outfit
of
his
own
his
brand
the
hogpen
of
sinister
suggestion
was
already
registered
at
santa
fe
but
of
horned
stock
it
was
borne
by
a
single
old
cow
so
as
to
give
him
a
legal
right
to
put
his
brand
on
any
maverick
or
unbranded
animal
he
might
chance
to
find
yet
each
fall
when
paid
off
jo
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
go
to
town
with
the
boys
and
have
a
good
time
the
stuff
held
out
so
that
his
property
consisted
of
little
more
than
his
saddle
his
bed
and
his
old
cow
he
kept
on
hoping
to
make
a
strike
that
would
leave
him
well
fixed
with
a
fair
start
and
when
the
thought
came
that
the
black
mustang
was
his
mascot
he
only
needed
a
chance
to
the
try
the
roundup
circled
down
to
the
canadian
river
and
back
in
the
fall
by
the
don
carlos
hills
and
jo
saw
no
more
of
the
pacer
though
he
heard
of
him
from
many
quarters
for
the
colt
now
a
vigorous
young
horse
rising
three
was
beginning
to
be
talked
of
antelope
springs
is
in
the
middle
of
a
great
level
plain
when
the
water
is
high
it
spreads
into
a
small
lake
with
a
belt
of
sedge
around
it
when
it
is
low
there
is
a
wide
flat
of
black
mud
glistening
white
with
alkali
in
places
and
the
spring
a
in
the
middle
it
has
no
flow
or
outlet
and
is
fairly
good
water
the
only
for
many
miles
this
flat
or
prairie
as
it
would
be
called
farther
north
was
the
favorite
of
the
black
stallion
but
it
was
also
the
pasture
of
many
herds
of
range
horses
and
cattle
chiefly
interested
was
the
cross
f
outfit
foster
the
manager
and
part
owner
was
a
man
of
enterprise
he
believed
it
would
pay
to
handle
a
better
class
of
cattle
and
horses
on
the
range
and
one
of
his
ventures
was
ten
mares
tall
creatures
that
made
the
scrub
look
like
pitiful
starvelings
of
some
degenerate
and
quite
different
species
one
of
these
was
kept
stabled
for
use
but
the
nine
after
the
weaning
of
their
colts
managed
to
get
away
and
wandered
off
on
the
range
a
horse
has
a
fine
instinct
for
the
road
to
the
best
feed
and
the
nine
mares
drifted
of
course
to
the
prairie
of
antelope
springs
twenty
miles
to
the
southward
and
when
later
that
summer
foster
went
to
round
them
up
he
found
the
nine
indeed
but
with
them
and
guarding
them
with
an
air
of
more
than
mere
comradeship
was
a
stallion
prancing
around
and
rounding
up
the
bunch
like
an
expert
his
coat
a
vivid
contrast
to
the
golden
hides
of
his
harem
the
mares
were
gentle
and
would
have
been
easily
driven
homeward
but
for
a
new
and
unexpected
thing
the
black
stallion
became
greatly
aroused
he
seemed
to
inspire
them
too
with
his
wildness
and
flying
this
way
and
that
way
drove
the
whole
band
at
full
gallop
where
he
would
away
they
went
and
the
little
that
carried
the
men
were
easily
left
behind
this
was
maddening
and
both
men
at
last
drew
their
guns
and
sought
a
chance
to
drop
that
stallion
but
no
chance
came
that
was
not
to
of
dropping
one
of
the
mares
a
long
day
of
manoeuvring
made
no
change
the
pacer
for
it
was
he
kept
his
family
together
and
disappeared
among
the
southern
the
cattlemen
on
their
jaded
ponies
set
out
for
home
with
the
poor
satisfaction
of
vowing
vengeance
for
their
failure
on
the
superb
cause
of
it
one
of
the
most
aggravating
parts
of
it
was
that
one
or
two
experiences
like
this
would
surely
make
the
mares
as
wild
as
the
mustang
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
way
of
saving
them
from
it
scientists
differ
on
the
power
of
beauty
and
prowess
to
attract
female
admiration
among
the
lower
animals
but
whether
it
is
admiration
or
the
prowess
itself
it
is
certain
that
a
wild
animal
of
uncommon
gifts
soon
wins
a
large
following
from
the
harems
of
his
rivals
and
the
great
black
horse
with
his
inky
mane
and
tail
and
his
eyes
ranged
through
all
that
region
and
added
to
his
following
from
many
bands
till
not
less
than
a
score
of
mares
were
in
his
most
were
merely
humble
turned
out
to
range
but
the
nine
great
mares
were
there
a
striking
group
by
themselves
according
to
all
reports
this
bunch
was
always
kept
rounded
up
and
guarded
with
such
energy
and
jealously
that
a
mare
once
in
it
was
a
lost
animal
so
far
as
man
was
concerned
and
the
ranchmen
realized
soon
that
they
had
gotten
on
the
range
a
mustang
that
was
doing
them
more
harm
than
all
other
sources
of
loss
put
together
ii
it
was
december
i
was
new
in
the
country
and
was
setting
out
from
the
on
the
pinavetitos
to
go
with
a
wagon
to
the
canadian
river
as
i
was
leaving
foster
finished
his
remark
by
and
if
you
get
a
chance
to
draw
a
bead
on
that
accursed
mustang
do
fail
to
drop
him
in
his
tracks
this
was
the
first
i
had
heard
of
him
and
as
i
rode
along
i
gathered
from
burns
my
guide
the
history
that
has
been
given
i
was
full
of
curiosity
to
see
the
famous
and
was
not
a
little
disappointed
on
the
second
day
when
we
came
to
the
prairie
on
antelope
springs
and
saw
no
sign
of
the
pacer
or
his
band
but
on
the
next
day
as
we
crossed
the
alamosa
arroyo
and
were
rising
to
the
rolling
prairie
again
jack
burns
who
was
riding
on
ahead
suddenly
dropped
flat
on
the
neck
of
his
horse
and
swung
back
to
me
in
the
wagon
saying
get
out
your
rifle
here
that
stallion
i
seized
my
rifle
and
hurried
forward
to
a
view
over
the
prairie
ridge
in
the
hollow
below
was
a
band
of
horses
and
there
at
one
end
was
the
great
black
mustang
he
had
heard
some
sound
of
our
approach
and
was
not
unsuspicious
of
danger
there
he
stood
with
head
and
tail
erect
and
nostrils
wide
an
image
of
horse
perfection
and
beauty
as
noble
an
animal
as
ever
ranged
the
plains
and
the
mere
notion
of
turning
that
magnificent
creature
into
a
mass
of
carrion
was
horrible
in
spite
of
jack
exhortation
to
quick
i
delayed
and
threw
open
the
breach
whereupon
he
always
hot
and
hasty
swore
at
my
slowness
growled
me
that
gun
and
as
he
seized
it
i
turned
the
muzzle
up
and
accidentally
the
gun
went
off
instantly
the
herd
below
was
all
alarm
the
great
black
leader
snorted
and
neighed
and
dashed
about
and
the
mares
bunched
and
away
all
went
in
a
rumble
of
hoofs
and
a
cloud
of
dust
the
stallion
careered
now
on
this
side
now
on
that
and
kept
his
eye
on
all
and
led
and
drove
them
far
away
as
long
as
i
could
see
i
watched
and
never
once
did
he
break
his
pace
jack
made
western
remarks
about
me
and
my
gun
as
well
as
that
mustang
but
i
rejoiced
in
the
pacer
strength
and
beauty
and
not
for
all
the
mares
in
the
bunch
would
i
have
harmed
his
glossy
hide
iii
there
are
several
ways
of
capturing
wild
horses
one
is
by
creasing
that
is
grazing
the
animal
nape
with
a
so
that
he
is
stunned
long
enough
for
hobbling
yes
i
seen
about
a
hundred
necks
broke
trying
it
but
i
never
seen
a
mustang
creased
yet
was
wild
jo
critical
remark
sometimes
if
the
shape
of
the
country
abets
it
the
herd
can
be
driven
into
a
corral
sometimes
with
extra
fine
mounts
they
can
be
run
down
but
by
far
the
commonest
way
paradoxical
as
it
may
seem
is
to
walk
them
down
the
fame
of
the
stallion
that
never
was
known
to
gallop
was
spreading
extraordinary
stories
were
told
of
his
gait
his
speed
and
his
wind
and
when
old
montgomery
of
the
outfit
came
out
plump
at
well
hotel
in
clayton
and
in
presence
of
witnesses
said
he
give
one
thousand
dollars
cash
for
him
safe
in
a
providing
the
stories
were
true
a
dozen
young
were
eager
to
cut
loose
and
win
the
purse
as
soon
as
present
engagements
were
up
but
wild
jo
had
had
his
eye
on
this
very
deal
for
quite
a
while
there
was
no
time
to
lose
so
ignoring
present
contracts
he
rustled
all
night
to
raise
the
necessary
equipment
for
the
game
by
straining
his
already
overstrained
credit
and
taxing
the
already
overtaxed
generosity
of
his
friends
he
got
together
an
expedition
consisting
of
twenty
good
a
and
a
stuff
for
three
men
himself
his
charley
and
the
cook
then
they
set
out
from
clayton
with
the
avowed
intention
of
walking
down
the
wonderfully
swift
wild
horse
the
third
day
they
arrived
at
antelope
springs
and
as
it
was
about
noon
they
were
not
surprised
to
see
the
black
pacer
marching
down
to
drink
with
all
his
band
behind
him
jo
kept
out
of
sight
until
the
wild
horses
each
and
all
had
drunk
their
fill
for
a
thirsty
animal
always
travels
better
than
one
laden
with
water
jo
then
rode
quietly
forward
the
pacer
took
alarm
at
half
a
mile
and
led
his
band
away
out
of
sight
on
the
soapweed
mesa
to
the
southeast
jo
followed
at
a
gallop
till
he
once
more
sighted
them
then
came
back
and
instructed
the
cook
who
was
also
teamster
to
make
for
alamosa
arroyo
in
the
south
then
away
to
the
southeast
he
went
after
the
mustangs
after
a
mile
or
two
he
once
more
sighted
them
and
walked
his
horse
quietly
till
so
near
that
they
again
took
alarm
and
circled
away
to
the
south
an
hour
trot
not
on
the
trail
but
cutting
across
to
where
they
ought
to
go
brought
jo
again
in
close
sight
again
he
walked
quietly
toward
the
herd
and
again
there
was
the
alarm
and
fright
and
so
they
passed
the
afternoon
but
circled
ever
more
and
more
to
the
south
so
that
when
the
sun
was
low
they
were
as
jo
had
expected
not
far
from
alamosa
arroyo
the
band
was
again
close
at
hand
and
jo
after
starting
them
off
rode
to
the
wagon
while
his
pard
who
had
been
taking
it
easy
took
up
the
slow
chase
on
a
fresh
horse
after
supper
the
wagon
moved
on
to
the
upper
ford
of
the
alamosa
as
arranged
and
there
camped
for
the
night
meanwhile
charley
followed
the
herd
they
had
not
run
so
far
as
at
first
for
their
pursuer
made
no
sign
of
attack
and
they
were
getting
used
to
his
company
they
were
more
easily
found
as
the
shadows
fell
on
account
of
a
mare
that
was
in
the
bunch
a
young
moon
in
the
sky
now
gave
some
help
and
relying
on
his
horse
to
choose
the
path
charley
kept
him
quietly
walking
after
the
herd
represented
by
that
mare
till
they
were
lost
in
the
night
he
then
got
off
unsaddled
and
picketed
his
horse
and
in
his
blanket
quickly
went
to
sleep
at
the
first
streak
of
dawn
he
was
up
and
within
a
short
thanks
to
the
snowy
mare
he
found
the
band
at
his
approach
the
shrill
neigh
of
the
pacer
bugled
his
troop
into
a
flying
squad
but
on
the
first
mesa
they
stopped
and
faced
about
to
see
what
this
persistent
follower
was
and
what
he
wanted
for
a
moment
or
so
they
stood
against
the
sky
to
gaze
and
then
deciding
that
he
knew
him
as
well
as
he
wished
to
that
black
meteor
flung
his
mane
on
the
wind
and
led
off
at
his
tireless
even
swing
while
the
mares
came
streaming
after
away
they
went
circling
now
to
the
west
and
after
several
repetitions
of
this
same
play
flying
following
and
overtaking
and
flying
again
they
passed
near
noon
the
old
apache
buffalo
bluff
and
here
on
watch
was
jo
a
long
thin
column
of
smoke
told
charley
to
come
to
camp
and
with
a
flashing
he
made
response
jo
freshly
mounted
rode
across
and
again
took
up
the
chase
and
back
came
charley
to
camp
to
eat
and
rest
and
then
move
on
up
stream
all
that
day
jo
followed
and
managed
when
it
was
needed
that
the
herd
should
keep
the
great
circle
of
which
the
wagon
cut
a
small
chord
at
sundown
he
came
to
verde
crossing
and
there
was
charley
with
a
fresh
horse
and
food
and
jo
went
on
in
the
same
calm
dogged
way
all
the
evening
he
followed
and
far
into
the
night
for
the
wild
herd
was
now
getting
somewhat
used
to
the
presence
of
the
harmless
strangers
and
were
more
easily
followed
moreover
they
were
tiring
out
with
perpetual
traveling
they
were
no
longer
in
the
good
grass
country
they
were
not
like
the
horses
on
their
track
and
above
all
the
slight
but
continuous
nervous
tension
was
surely
telling
it
spoiled
their
appetites
but
made
them
very
thirsty
they
were
allowed
and
as
far
as
possible
encouraged
to
drink
deeply
at
every
chance
the
effect
of
large
quantities
of
water
on
a
running
animal
is
well
known
it
tends
to
stiffen
the
limbs
and
spoil
the
wind
jo
carefully
guarded
his
own
horse
against
such
excess
and
both
he
and
his
horse
were
fresh
when
they
camped
that
night
on
the
trail
of
the
jaded
mustangs
at
dawn
he
found
them
easily
close
at
hand
and
though
they
ran
at
first
they
did
not
go
far
before
they
dropped
into
a
walk
the
battle
seemed
nearly
won
now
for
the
chief
difficulty
in
the
is
to
keep
track
of
the
herd
the
first
two
or
three
days
when
they
are
fresh
all
that
morning
jo
kept
in
sight
generally
in
close
sight
of
the
band
about
ten
charley
relieved
him
near
jos
peak
and
that
day
the
mustangs
walked
only
a
quarter
of
a
mile
ahead
with
much
less
spirit
than
the
day
before
and
circled
now
more
north
again
at
night
charley
was
supplied
with
a
fresh
horse
and
followed
as
before
next
day
the
mustangs
walked
with
heads
held
low
and
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
the
black
pacer
at
times
they
were
less
than
a
hundred
yards
ahead
of
their
pursuer
the
fourth
and
fifth
days
passed
the
same
way
and
now
the
herd
was
nearly
back
to
antelope
springs
so
far
all
had
come
out
as
expected
the
chase
had
been
in
a
great
circle
with
the
wagon
following
a
lesser
circle
the
wild
herd
was
back
to
its
worn
out
and
the
hunters
were
back
fresh
and
on
fresh
horses
the
herd
was
kept
from
drinking
till
late
in
the
afternoon
and
then
driven
to
the
springs
to
swell
themselves
with
a
perfect
water
gorge
now
was
the
chance
for
the
skilful
ropers
on
the
horses
to
close
in
for
the
sudden
heavy
drink
was
ruination
almost
paralysis
of
wind
and
limb
and
it
would
be
easy
to
rope
and
hobble
them
one
by
one
there
was
only
one
weak
spot
in
the
programme
the
black
stallion
the
cause
of
the
hunt
seemed
made
of
iron
that
ceaseless
swinging
pace
seemed
as
swift
and
vigorous
now
as
on
the
morning
when
the
chase
began
up
and
down
he
went
rounding
up
the
herd
and
urging
them
on
by
voice
and
example
to
escape
but
they
were
played
out
the
old
white
mare
that
had
been
such
help
in
sighting
them
at
night
had
dropped
out
hours
ago
dead
beat
the
seemed
to
be
losing
all
fear
of
the
horsemen
the
band
was
clearly
in
jo
power
but
the
one
who
was
the
prize
of
all
the
hunt
seemed
just
as
far
as
ever
out
of
reach
here
was
a
puzzle
jo
comrades
knew
him
well
and
would
not
have
been
surprised
to
see
him
in
a
sudden
rage
attempt
to
shoot
the
stallion
down
but
jo
had
no
such
mind
during
that
long
week
of
following
he
had
watched
the
horse
all
day
at
speed
and
never
once
had
he
seen
him
gallop
the
horseman
adoration
of
a
noble
horse
had
grown
and
grown
till
now
he
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
shooting
his
best
mount
as
firing
on
that
splendid
beast
jo
even
asked
himself
whether
he
would
take
the
handsome
sum
that
was
offered
for
the
prize
such
an
animal
would
be
a
fortune
in
himself
to
sire
a
race
of
pacers
for
the
track
but
the
prize
was
still
at
large
the
time
had
come
to
finish
up
the
hunt
jo
finest
mount
was
caught
she
was
a
mare
of
eastern
blood
but
raised
on
the
plains
she
never
would
have
come
into
jo
possession
but
for
a
curious
weakness
the
loco
is
a
poisonous
weed
that
grows
in
these
regions
most
stock
will
not
touch
it
but
sometimes
an
animal
tries
it
and
becomes
addicted
to
it
it
acts
somewhat
like
morphine
but
the
animal
though
sane
for
long
intervals
has
always
a
passion
for
the
herb
and
finally
dies
mad
a
beast
with
the
craze
is
said
to
be
locoed
and
jo
best
mount
had
a
wild
gleam
in
her
eye
that
to
an
expert
told
the
tale
but
she
was
swift
and
strong
and
jo
chose
her
for
the
grand
finish
of
the
chase
it
would
have
been
an
easy
matter
now
to
rope
the
mares
but
was
no
longer
necessary
they
could
be
separated
from
their
black
leader
and
driven
home
to
the
corral
but
that
leader
still
had
the
look
of
untamed
strength
jo
rejoicing
in
a
worthy
foe
went
bounding
forth
to
try
the
odds
the
lasso
was
flung
on
the
ground
and
trailed
to
take
out
every
kink
and
gathered
as
he
rode
into
neatest
coils
across
his
left
palm
then
putting
on
the
spur
the
first
time
in
that
chase
he
rode
straight
for
the
stallion
a
quarter
of
a
mile
beyond
away
he
went
and
away
went
jo
each
at
his
best
while
the
mares
scattered
right
and
left
and
let
them
pass
straight
across
the
open
plain
the
fresh
horse
went
at
its
hardest
gallop
and
the
stallion
leading
off
still
kept
his
start
and
kept
his
famous
swing
it
was
incredible
and
jo
put
on
more
spur
and
shouted
to
his
horse
which
fairly
flew
but
shortened
up
the
space
between
by
not
a
single
inch
for
the
black
one
whirled
across
the
flat
and
up
and
passed
a
mesa
and
down
across
a
sandy
treacherous
plain
then
over
a
grassy
stretch
where
prairie
dogs
barked
then
hid
below
and
on
came
jo
but
there
to
see
could
he
believe
his
eyes
the
stallion
start
grown
longer
still
and
jo
began
to
curse
his
luck
and
urge
and
spur
his
horse
until
the
poor
uncertain
brute
got
into
such
a
state
of
nervous
fright
her
eyes
began
to
roll
she
wildly
shook
her
head
from
side
to
side
no
longer
picked
her
ground
a
received
her
foot
and
down
she
went
and
jo
went
flying
to
the
earth
though
badly
bruised
he
gained
his
feet
and
tried
to
mount
his
crazy
beast
but
she
poor
brute
was
done
for
her
off
hung
loose
there
was
but
one
thing
to
do
jo
loosed
the
cinch
put
lightfoot
out
of
pain
and
carried
back
the
saddle
to
the
camp
while
the
pacer
steamed
away
till
lost
to
view
this
was
not
quite
defeat
for
all
the
mares
were
manageable
now
and
jo
and
charley
drove
them
carefully
to
the
cross
f
corral
and
claimed
a
good
reward
but
jo
was
more
than
ever
bound
to
own
the
stallion
he
had
seen
what
stuff
he
was
made
of
he
prized
him
more
and
more
and
only
sought
to
strike
some
better
plan
to
catch
him
iv
the
cook
on
that
trip
was
bates
thomas
bates
he
called
himself
at
the
where
he
regularly
went
for
the
letters
and
remittance
which
never
came
old
tom
turkeytrack
the
boys
called
him
from
his
which
he
said
was
on
record
at
denver
and
which
according
to
his
story
was
also
borne
by
countless
beef
and
saddle
stock
on
the
plains
of
the
unknown
north
when
asked
to
join
the
trip
as
a
partner
bates
made
some
sarcastic
remarks
about
horses
not
fetching
a
dozen
which
had
been
literally
true
within
the
year
and
he
preferred
to
go
on
a
very
meagre
salary
but
no
one
who
once
saw
the
pacer
going
had
failed
to
catch
the
craze
turkeytrack
experienced
the
usual
change
of
heart
he
now
wanted
to
own
that
mustang
how
this
was
to
be
brought
about
he
did
not
clearly
see
till
one
day
there
called
at
the
ranch
that
had
his
services
as
he
put
it
one
bill
smith
more
usually
known
as
horseshoe
billy
from
his
while
the
excellent
fresh
beef
and
bread
and
the
vile
coffee
dried
peaches
and
molasses
were
being
consumed
he
of
the
horseshoe
remarked
in
tones
which
percolated
through
a
huge
of
bread
wall
i
seen
that
thar
pacer
nigh
enough
to
put
a
plait
in
his
tail
what
you
did
shoot
no
but
i
come
mighty
near
it
do
you
be
led
into
no
sich
foolishness
said
a
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
i
that
maverick
carry
my
brand
before
the
moon
changes
you
have
to
be
pretty
spry
or
you
find
a
dot
on
his
weather
side
when
you
get
there
where
did
you
run
across
him
wail
it
was
like
this
i
was
riding
the
flat
by
antelope
springs
and
i
sees
a
lump
on
the
dry
mud
inside
the
rush
belt
i
knowed
i
never
seen
that
before
so
i
rides
up
thinking
it
might
be
some
of
our
stock
seen
it
was
a
horse
lying
plumb
flat
the
wind
was
blowing
like
from
him
to
me
so
i
rides
up
close
and
seen
it
was
the
pacer
dead
as
a
mackerel
still
he
did
look
swelled
or
cut
and
there
no
smell
an
i
did
know
what
to
think
till
i
seen
his
ear
twitch
off
a
fly
and
then
i
knowed
he
was
sleeping
i
gits
down
me
rope
and
coils
it
and
seen
it
was
old
and
pretty
shaky
in
spots
and
me
saddle
a
single
cinch
an
me
pony
about
again
a
lbs
stallion
an
i
sez
to
meself
sez
i
no
use
i
only
break
me
cinch
and
git
throwed
an
lose
me
saddle
so
i
hits
the
a
crack
with
the
hondu
and
i
you
a
seen
that
mustang
he
lept
six
foot
in
the
air
snorted
like
he
was
shunting
cars
his
eyes
fairly
bugged
out
an
he
lighted
out
lickety
split
for
california
and
he
orter
be
there
about
now
if
he
kep
on
like
he
started
and
i
swear
he
never
made
a
break
the
hull
trip
the
story
was
not
quite
so
consecutive
as
given
here
it
was
much
punctuated
by
present
engrossments
and
from
first
to
last
was
more
or
less
infiltrated
through
the
necessaries
of
life
for
bill
was
a
healthy
young
man
without
a
trace
of
false
shame
but
the
account
was
complete
and
everyone
believed
it
for
billy
was
known
to
be
reliable
of
all
those
who
heard
old
turkeytrack
talked
the
least
and
probably
thought
the
most
for
it
gave
him
a
new
idea
during
his
pipe
he
studied
it
out
and
deciding
that
he
could
not
go
it
alone
he
took
horseshoe
billy
into
his
council
and
the
result
was
a
partnership
in
a
new
venture
to
capture
the
pacer
that
is
the
that
was
now
said
to
be
the
offer
for
him
safe
in
a
antelope
springs
was
still
the
usual
of
the
pacer
the
water
being
low
left
a
broad
belt
of
dry
black
mud
between
the
sedge
and
the
spring
at
two
places
this
belt
was
broken
by
a
trail
made
by
the
animals
coming
to
drink
horses
and
wild
animals
usually
kept
to
these
trails
though
the
horned
cattle
had
no
hesitation
in
taking
a
short
cut
through
the
sedge
in
the
most
used
of
these
trails
the
two
men
set
to
work
with
shovels
and
dug
a
pit
feet
long
feet
wide
and
feet
deep
it
was
a
hard
twenty
hours
work
for
them
as
it
had
to
be
completed
between
the
mustang
drinks
and
it
began
to
be
very
damp
work
before
it
was
finished
with
poles
brush
and
earth
it
was
then
cleverly
covered
over
and
concealed
and
the
men
went
to
a
distance
and
hid
in
pits
made
for
the
purpose
about
noon
the
pacer
came
alone
now
since
the
capture
of
his
band
the
trail
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
mud
belt
was
little
used
and
old
tom
by
throwing
some
fresh
rushes
across
it
expected
to
make
sure
that
the
stallion
would
enter
by
the
other
if
indeed
he
should
by
any
caprice
try
to
come
by
the
unusual
path
what
sleepless
angel
is
it
watches
over
and
cares
for
the
wild
animals
in
spite
of
all
reasons
to
take
the
usual
path
the
pacer
came
along
the
other
the
rushes
did
not
stop
him
he
walked
calmly
to
the
water
and
drank
there
was
only
one
way
now
to
prevent
utter
failure
when
he
lowered
his
head
for
the
second
draft
which
horses
always
take
bates
and
smith
quit
their
holes
and
ran
swiftly
toward
the
trail
behind
him
and
when
he
raised
his
proud
head
smith
sent
a
revolver
shot
into
the
ground
behind
him
away
went
the
pacer
at
his
famous
gait
straight
to
the
trap
another
second
and
he
would
be
into
it
already
he
is
on
the
trail
and
already
they
feel
they
have
him
but
the
angel
of
the
wild
things
is
with
him
that
incomprehensible
warning
comes
and
with
one
mighty
bound
he
clears
the
fifteen
feet
of
treacherous
ground
and
spurns
the
earth
as
he
fades
away
unharmed
never
again
to
visit
antelope
springs
by
either
of
the
beaten
paths
v
wild
jo
never
lacked
energy
he
meant
to
catch
that
mustang
and
when
he
learned
that
others
were
bestirring
themselves
for
the
same
purpose
he
at
once
set
about
trying
the
best
untried
plan
he
knew
the
plan
by
which
the
coyote
catches
the
fleeter
jackrabbit
and
the
mounted
indian
the
far
swifter
antelope
the
old
plan
of
the
relay
chase
the
canadian
river
on
the
south
its
affluent
the
pinavetitos
arroyo
on
the
northeast
and
the
don
carlos
hills
with
the
ute
creek
canyon
on
the
west
formed
a
triangle
that
was
the
range
of
the
pacer
it
was
believed
that
he
never
went
outside
this
and
at
all
times
antelope
springs
was
his
headquarters
jo
knew
this
country
well
all
the
and
canon
crossings
as
well
as
the
ways
of
the
pacer
if
he
could
have
gotten
fifty
good
horses
he
could
have
posted
them
to
advantage
so
as
to
cover
all
points
but
twenty
mounts
and
five
good
riders
were
all
that
proved
available
the
horses
for
two
weeks
before
were
sent
on
ahead
each
man
was
instructed
how
to
play
his
part
and
sent
to
his
post
the
day
before
the
race
on
the
day
of
the
start
jo
with
his
wagon
drove
to
the
plain
of
antelope
springs
and
camping
far
off
in
a
little
draw
waited
at
last
he
came
that
horse
out
from
the
at
the
south
alone
as
always
now
and
walked
calmly
down
to
the
springs
and
circled
quite
around
it
to
sniff
for
any
hidden
foe
then
he
approached
where
there
was
no
trail
at
all
and
drank
jo
watched
and
wished
that
he
would
drink
a
but
the
moment
that
he
turned
and
sought
the
grass
jo
spurred
his
steed
the
pacer
heard
the
hoofs
then
saw
the
running
horse
and
did
not
want
a
nearer
view
but
led
away
across
the
flat
he
went
down
to
the
south
and
kept
the
famous
swinging
gait
that
made
his
start
grow
longer
now
through
the
sandy
dunes
he
went
and
steadying
to
an
even
pace
he
gained
considerably
and
jo
horse
plunged
through
the
sand
and
sinking
fetlock
deep
he
lost
at
every
bound
then
came
a
level
stretch
where
the
runner
seemed
to
gain
and
then
a
long
decline
where
horse
dared
not
run
his
best
so
lost
again
at
every
step
but
on
they
went
and
jo
spared
neither
spur
nor
quirt
a
mile
a
mile
and
another
mile
and
the
rock
at
arriba
loomed
up
ahead
and
there
jo
knew
fresh
mounts
were
held
and
on
they
dashed
but
the
mane
out
level
on
the
breeze
ahead
was
gaining
more
and
more
arriba
canon
reached
at
last
the
watcher
stood
aside
for
it
was
not
wished
to
turn
the
race
and
the
stallion
passed
dashed
down
across
and
up
the
slope
with
that
unbroken
pace
the
only
one
he
knew
and
jo
came
bounding
on
his
foaming
steed
and
on
the
waiting
mount
then
urged
him
down
the
slope
and
up
upon
the
track
and
on
the
upland
once
more
drove
in
the
spurs
and
raced
and
raced
and
raced
but
not
a
single
inch
he
gained
with
measured
beat
he
went
an
hour
an
hour
and
another
hour
arroyo
alamosa
just
ahead
with
fresh
relays
and
jo
yelled
at
his
horse
and
pushed
him
on
and
on
straight
for
the
place
the
black
one
made
but
on
the
last
two
miles
some
strange
foreboding
turned
him
to
the
left
and
jo
foresaw
escape
in
this
and
pushed
his
jaded
mount
at
any
cost
to
head
him
off
and
hard
as
they
had
raced
this
was
the
hardest
race
of
all
with
gasps
for
breath
and
leather
squeaks
at
every
straining
bound
then
cutting
right
across
jo
seemed
to
gain
and
drawing
his
gun
he
fired
shot
after
shot
to
toss
the
dust
and
so
turned
the
stallion
head
and
forced
him
back
to
take
the
crossing
to
the
right
down
they
went
the
stallion
crossed
and
jo
sprang
to
the
ground
his
horse
was
done
for
thirty
miles
had
passed
in
the
last
stretch
and
jo
himself
was
worn
out
his
eyes
were
burnt
with
flying
alkali
dust
he
was
half
blind
so
he
motioned
to
his
to
go
ahead
and
keep
him
straight
for
alamosa
ford
out
shot
the
rider
on
a
strong
fresh
steed
and
away
they
went
up
and
down
on
the
rolling
plain
the
black
horse
flecked
with
snowy
foam
his
heaving
ribs
and
noisy
breath
showed
what
he
felt
but
on
and
on
he
went
and
tom
on
ginger
seemed
to
gain
then
lose
and
lose
when
in
an
hour
the
long
decline
of
alamosa
came
and
there
a
freshly
mounted
lad
took
up
the
chase
and
turned
it
west
and
on
they
went
past
towns
of
prairie
dogs
through
soapweed
tracts
and
cactus
brakes
by
scores
and
pricked
and
wrenched
rode
on
with
dust
and
sweat
the
black
was
now
a
dappled
brown
but
still
he
stepped
the
same
young
carrington
who
followed
bad
hurt
his
steed
by
pushing
at
the
very
start
and
spurred
and
urged
him
now
to
cut
across
a
gulch
at
which
the
pacer
shied
just
one
misstep
and
down
they
went
the
boy
escaped
but
the
pony
lies
there
yet
and
the
wild
black
horse
kept
on
this
was
close
to
old
gallego
ranch
where
jo
himself
had
cut
across
refreshed
to
push
the
chase
within
thirty
minutes
he
was
again
scorching
the
pacer
trail
far
in
the
west
the
carlos
hills
were
seen
and
there
jo
knew
fresh
men
and
mounts
were
waiting
and
that
way
the
indomitable
rider
tried
to
turn
the
race
but
by
a
sudden
whim
of
the
inner
warning
born
perhaps
the
pacer
turned
sharp
to
the
north
he
went
and
jo
the
skilful
wrangler
rode
and
rode
and
yelled
and
tossed
the
dust
with
shots
but
down
on
a
gulch
the
wild
black
meteor
streamed
and
jo
could
only
follow
then
came
the
hardest
race
of
all
jo
cruel
to
the
mustang
was
crueller
to
his
mount
and
to
himself
the
sun
was
hot
the
scorching
plain
was
dim
in
shimmering
heat
his
eyes
and
lips
were
burnt
with
sand
and
salt
and
yet
the
chase
sped
on
the
only
chance
to
win
would
be
if
he
could
drive
the
mustang
back
to
the
big
arroyo
crossing
now
almost
for
the
first
time
he
saw
signs
of
weakening
in
the
black
his
mane
and
tail
were
not
just
quite
so
high
and
his
short
half
mile
of
start
was
down
by
more
than
half
but
still
he
stayed
ahead
and
paced
and
paced
and
paced
an
hour
and
another
hour
and
still
they
went
the
same
but
they
turned
again
and
night
was
near
when
big
arroyo
ford
was
reached
fully
twenty
miles
but
jo
was
game
he
seized
the
waiting
horse
the
one
he
left
went
gasping
to
the
stream
and
gorged
himself
with
water
till
he
died
then
jo
held
back
in
hopes
the
foaming
black
would
drink
but
he
was
wise
he
gulped
a
single
gulp
splashed
through
the
stream
and
then
passed
on
with
jo
at
speed
behind
him
and
when
they
last
were
seen
the
black
was
on
ahead
just
out
of
reach
and
jo
horse
bounding
on
it
was
morning
when
jo
came
to
camp
on
foot
his
tale
was
briefly
told

he
grinned
into
the
pot
and
said
that
mustang

then
falling
back
on

for
a

was

persecution
had
made
the
pacer
wilder
than
ever
but
it
did
not
drive
him
away
from
antelope
springs
that
was
the
only
with
absolutely
no
shelter
for
a
mile
on
every
side
to
hide
an
enemy
here
he
came
almost
every
day
about
noon
and
after
thoroughly
spying
the
land
approached
to
drink
his
had
been
a
lonely
life
all
winter
since
the
capture
of
his
harem
and
of
this
old
turkeytrack
was
fully
aware
the
old
cook
chum
had
a
nice
little
brown
mare
which
he
judged
would
serve
his
ends
and
taking
a
pair
of
the
strongest
hobbles
a
spade
a
spare
lasso
and
a
stout
post
he
mounted
the
mare
and
rode
away
to
the
famous
springs
a
few
antelope
skimmed
over
the
plain
before
him
in
the
early
freshness
of
the
day
cattle
were
lying
about
in
groups
and
the
loud
sweet
song
of
the
prairie
lark
was
heard
on
every
side
for
the
bright
snowless
winter
of
the
mesas
was
gone
and
the
springtime
was
at
hand
the
grass
was
greening
and
all
nature
seemed
turning
to
thoughts
of
love
it
was
in
the
air
and
when
the
little
brown
mare
was
picketed
out
to
graze
she
raised
her
nose
from
time
to
time
to
pour
forth
a
long
shrill
whinny
that
surely
was
her
song
if
song
she
had
of
love
old
turkeytrack
studied
the
wind
and
the
lay
of
the
land
there
was
the
pit
he
had
labored
at
now
opened
and
filled
with
water
that
was
rank
with
drowned
prairie
dogs
and
mice
here
was
the
new
trail
the
animals
were
forced
to
make
by
the
pit
he
selected
a
sedgy
clump
near
some
smooth
grassy
ground
and
first
firmly
sunk
the
post
then
dug
a
hole
large
enough
to
hide
in
and
spread
his
blanket
in
it
he
shortened
up
the
little
mare
tether
till
she
could
scarcely
move
then
on
the
ground
between
he
spread
his
open
lasso
tying
the
long
end
to
the
post
then
covered
the
rope
with
dust
and
grass
and
went
into
his
about
noon
after
long
waiting
the
amorous
whinny
of
the
mare
was
answered
from
the
high
ground
away
to
the
west
and
there
black
against
the
sky
was
the
famous
mustang
down
he
came
at
that
long
swinging
gait
but
grown
crafty
with
much
pursuit
he
often
stopped
to
gaze
and
whinny
and
got
answer
that
surely
touched
his
heart
nearer
he
came
again
to
call
then
took
alarm
and
paced
all
around
in
a
great
circle
to
try
the
wind
for
his
foes
and
seemed
in
doubt
the
angel
whispered
do
go
but
the
brown
mare
called
again
he
circled
nearer
still
and
neighed
once
more
and
got
reply
that
seemed
to
quell
all
fears
and
set
his
heart
aglow
nearer
still
he
pranced
till
he
touched
solly
nose
with
his
own
and
finding
her
as
responsive
as
he
well
could
wish
thrust
aside
all
thoughts
of
danger
and
abandoned
himself
to
the
delight
of
conquest
until
as
he
pranced
around
his
hind
legs
for
a
moment
stood
within
the
evil
circle
of
the
rope
one
deft
sharp
twitch
the
noose
flew
tight
and
he
was
caught
a
snort
of
terror
and
a
bound
in
the
air
gave
tom
the
chance
to
add
the
double
hitch
the
loop
flashed
up
the
line
and
bound
those
mighty
hoofs
terror
lent
speed
and
double
strength
for
a
moment
but
the
end
of
the
rope
was
reached
and
down
he
went
a
captive
a
hopeless
prisoner
at
last
old
tom
ugly
little
crooked
form
sprang
from
the
pit
to
complete
the
mastering
of
the
great
glorious
creature
whose
mighty
strength
had
proved
as
nothing
when
matched
with
the
wits
of
a
little
old
man
with
snorts
and
desperate
bounds
of
awful
force
the
great
beast
dashed
and
struggled
to
be
free
but
all
in
vain
the
rope
was
strong
the
second
lasso
was
deftly
swung
and
the
forefeet
caught
and
then
with
a
skilful
move
the
feet
were
drawn
together
and
down
went
the
raging
pacer
to
lie
a
moment
later
and
helpless
on
the
ground
there
he
struggled
till
worn
out
sobbing
great
convulsive
sobs
while
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
tom
stood
by
and
watched
but
a
strange
revulsion
of
feeling
came
over
the
old
he
trembled
nervously
from
head
to
foot
as
he
had
not
done
since
he
roped
his
first
steer
and
for
a
while
could
do
nothing
but
gaze
on
his
tremendous
prisoner
but
the
feeling
soon
passed
away
he
saddled
delilah
and
taking
the
second
lasso
roped
the
great
horse
about
the
neck
and
left
the
mare
to
hold
the
stallion
head
while
he
put
on
the
hobbles
this
was
soon
done
and
sure
of
him
now
old
bates
was
about
to
loose
the
ropes
but
on
a
sudden
thought
he
stopped
he
had
quite
forgotten
and
had
come
unprepared
for
something
of
importance
in
western
law
the
mustang
was
the
property
of
the
first
man
to
mark
him
with
his
brand
how
was
this
to
be
done
with
the
nearest
twenty
miles
away
old
tom
went
to
his
mare
took
up
her
hoofs
one
at
a
time
and
examined
each
shoe
yes
one
was
a
little
loose
he
pushed
and
pried
it
with
the
spade
and
got
it
off
buffalo
chips
and
kindred
fuel
were
plentiful
about
the
plain
so
a
fire
was
quickly
made
and
he
soon
had
one
arm
of
the
red
hot
then
holding
the
other
wrapped
in
his
sock
he
rudely
sketched
on
the
left
shoulder
of
the
helpless
mustang
a
turkeytrack
his
brand
the
first
time
really
that
it
had
ever
been
used
the
pacer
shuddered
as
the
hot
iron
seared
his
flesh
but
it
was
quickly
done
and
the
famous
mustang
stallion
was
a
maverick
no
more
now
all
there
was
to
do
was
to
take
him
home
the
ropes
were
loosed
the
mustang
felt
himself
freed
thought
he
was
free
and
sprang
to
his
feet
only
to
fall
as
soon
as
he
tried
to
take
a
stride
his
forefeet
were
strongly
tied
together
his
only
possible
gait
a
shuffling
walk
or
else
a
desperate
labored
bounding
with
feet
so
unnaturally
held
that
within
a
few
yards
he
was
inevitably
thrown
each
time
he
tired
to
break
away
tom
on
the
light
pony
headed
him
off
again
and
again
and
by
dint
of
driving
threatening
and
maneuvering
contrived
to
force
his
foaming
crazy
captive
northward
toward
the
pinavetitos
canyon
but
the
wild
horse
would
not
drive
would
not
give
in
with
snorts
of
terror
or
of
rage
and
maddest
bounds
he
tried
and
tried
to
get
away
it
was
one
long
cruel
fight
his
glossy
sides
were
thick
with
dark
foam
and
the
foam
was
stained
with
blood
countless
hard
falls
and
exhaustion
that
a
long
day
chase
was
powerless
to
produce
were
telling
on
him
his
straining
bounds
first
this
way
and
then
that
were
not
now
quite
so
strong
and
the
spray
he
snorted
as
he
gasped
was
half
a
spray
of
blood
but
his
captor
relentless
masterful
and
cool
still
forced
him
on
down
the
slope
toward
the
canyon
they
had
come
every
yard
a
fight
and
now
they
were
at
the
head
of
the
draw
that
took
the
trail
down
to
the
only
crossing
of
the
canon
the
northmost
limit
of
the
pacer
ancient
range
from
this
the
first
corral
and
were
in
sight
the
man
rejoiced
but
the
mustang
gathered
his
remaining
strength
for
one
more
desperate
dash
up
up
the
grassy
slope
from
the
trail
he
went
defied
the
swinging
slashing
rope
and
the
gunshot
fired
in
air
in
vain
attempt
to
turn
his
frenzied
course
up
up
and
on
above
the
sheerest
cliff
he
dashed
then
sprang
away
into
the
vacant
air
down
down
two
hundred
downward
feet
to
fall
and
land
upon
the
rocks
below
a
lifeless
wreck
but
free
wully
the
story
of
a
yaller
dog
wully
was
a
little
yaller
dog
a
yaller
dog
be
it
understood
is
not
necessarily
the
same
as
a
yellow
dog
he
is
not
simply
a
canine
whose
capillary
covering
is
highly
charged
with
yellow
pigment
he
is
the
mongrelest
mixture
of
all
mongrels
the
least
common
multiple
of
all
dogs
the
breedless
union
of
all
breeds
and
though
of
no
breed
at
all
he
is
yet
of
older
better
breed
than
any
of
his
aristocratic
relations
for
he
is
nature
attempt
to
restore
the
ancestral
jackal
the
parent
stock
of
all
dogs
indeed
the
scientific
name
of
the
jackal
canis
aureus
means
simply
dog
and
not
a
few
of
that
animal
characteristics
are
seen
in
his
domesticated
representative
for
the
plebeian
cur
is
shrewd
active
and
hardy
and
far
better
equipped
for
the
real
struggle
of
life
than
any
of
his
kinsmen
if
we
were
to
abandon
a
yaller
dog
a
greyhound
and
a
bulldog
on
a
desert
island
which
of
them
after
six
months
would
be
alive
and
well
unquestionably
it
would
be
the
despised
yellow
cur
he
has
not
the
speed
of
the
greyhound
but
neither
does
he
bear
the
seeds
of
lung
and
skin
diseases
he
has
not
the
strength
or
reckless
courage
of
the
bulldog
but
he
has
something
a
thousand
times
better
he
has
common
sense
health
and
wit
are
no
mean
equipment
for
the
life
struggle
and
when
the
is
not
by
man
they
have
never
yet
failed
to
bring
out
the
yellow
mongrel
as
the
sole
and
triumphant
survivor
once
in
a
while
the
reversion
to
the
jackal
type
is
more
complete
and
the
yaller
dog
has
pricked
and
pointed
ears
beware
of
him
then
he
is
cunning
and
plucky
and
can
bite
like
a
wolf
there
is
a
strange
wild
streak
in
his
nature
too
that
under
cruelty
or
long
adversity
may
develop
into
deadliest
treachery
in
spite
of
the
better
traits
that
are
the
foundation
of
man
love
for
the
dog
i
away
up
in
the
cheviots
little
wully
was
born
he
and
one
other
of
the
litter
were
kept
his
brother
because
he
resembled
the
best
dog
in
the
vicinity
and
himself
because
he
was
a
little
yellow
beauty
his
early
life
was
that
of
a
in
company
with
an
experienced
collie
who
trained
him
and
an
old
shepherd
who
was
scarcely
inferior
to
them
in
intelligence
by
the
time
he
was
two
years
old
wully
was
full
grown
and
had
taken
a
thorough
course
in
sheep
he
knew
them
from
to
and
old
robin
his
master
at
length
had
such
confidence
in
his
sagacity
that
he
would
frequently
stay
at
the
tavern
all
night
while
wully
guarded
the
woolly
idiots
in
the
hills
his
education
had
been
wisely
bestowed
and
in
most
ways
he
was
a
very
bright
little
dog
with
a
future
before
him
yet
he
never
learned
to
despise
that
robin
the
old
shepherd
with
all
his
faults
his
continual
striving
after
his
ideal
state
intoxication
and
his
life
in
general
was
rarely
brutal
to
wully
and
wully
repaid
him
with
an
exaggerated
worship
that
the
greatest
and
wisest
in
the
land
would
have
aspired
to
in
vain
wully
could
not
have
imagined
any
greater
being
than
robin
and
yet
for
the
sum
of
five
shillings
a
week
all
robin
vital
energy
and
mental
force
were
pledged
to
the
service
of
a
not
very
great
cattle
and
sheep
dealer
the
real
proprietor
of
wully
charge
and
when
this
man
really
less
great
than
the
neighboring
laird
ordered
robin
to
drive
his
flock
by
stages
to
the
yorkshire
moors
and
markets
of
all
the
mentalities
concerned
wully
was
the
most
interested
and
interesting
the
journey
through
northumberland
was
uneventful
at
the
river
tyne
the
sheep
were
driven
on
to
the
ferry
and
landed
safely
in
smoky
south
shields
the
great
factory
chimneys
were
just
starting
up
for
the
day
and
belching
out
fogbanks
and
of
opaque
leaden
smoke
that
darkened
the
air
and
hung
low
like
a
over
the
streets
the
sheep
thought
that
they
recognized
the
fuming
dun
of
an
unusually
heavy
cheviot
storm
they
became
alarmed
and
in
spite
of
their
keepers
stampeded
through
the
town
in
different
directions
robin
was
vexed
to
the
inmost
recesses
of
his
tiny
soul
he
stared
stupidly
after
the
sheep
for
half
a
minute
then
gave
the
order
wully
fetch
them
in
after
this
mental
effort
he
sat
down
lit
his
pipe
and
taking
out
his
knitting
began
work
on
a
sock
to
wully
the
voice
of
robin
was
the
voice
of
god
away
he
ran
in
different
directions
and
headed
off
and
rounded
up
the
different
wanderers
and
brought
them
back
to
the
before
robin
who
was
stolidly
watching
the
process
had
toed
off
his
sock
finally
wully
not
robin
gave
the
sign
that
all
were
in
the
old
shepherd
proceeded
to
count
them
wully
he
said
reproachfully
thar
no
a
here
thur
anither
and
wully
stung
with
shame
bounded
off
to
scour
the
whole
city
for
the
missing
one
he
was
not
long
gone
when
a
small
boy
pointed
out
to
robin
that
the
sheep
were
all
there
the
whole
now
robin
was
in
a
quandary
his
order
was
to
hasten
on
to
yorkshire
and
yet
he
knew
that
wully
pride
would
prevent
his
coming
back
without
another
sheep
even
if
he
had
to
steal
it
such
things
had
happened
before
and
resulted
in
embarrassing
complications
what
should
he
do
there
was
five
shillings
a
week
at
stake
wully
was
a
good
dog
it
was
a
pity
to
lose
him
but
then
his
orders
from
the
master
and
again
if
wully
stole
an
extra
sheep
to
make
up
the
number
then
what
in
a
foreign
land
too
he
decided
to
abandon
wully
and
push
on
alone
with
the
sheep
and
how
he
fared
no
one
knows
or
cares
meanwhile
wully
careered
through
miles
of
streets
hunting
in
vain
for
his
lost
sheep
all
day
he
searched
and
at
night
famished
and
worn
out
he
sneaked
shamefacedly
back
to
the
ferry
only
to
find
that
master
and
sheep
had
gone
his
sorrow
was
pitiful
to
see
he
ran
about
whimpering
then
took
the
ferryboat
across
to
the
other
side
and
searched
everywhere
for
robin
he
returned
to
south
shields
and
searched
there
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
night
seeking
for
his
wretched
idol
the
next
day
he
continued
his
search
he
crossed
and
recrossed
the
river
many
times
he
watched
and
smelt
everyone
that
came
over
and
with
significant
shrewdness
he
sought
unceasingly
in
the
neighboring
taverns
for
his
master
the
next
day
he
set
to
work
systematically
to
smell
everyone
that
might
cross
the
ferry
the
ferry
makes
fifty
trips
a
day
with
an
average
of
one
hundred
persons
a
trip
yet
never
once
did
wully
fail
to
be
on
the
and
smell
every
pair
of
legs
that
crossed
pairs
legs
that
day
did
wully
examine
after
his
own
fashion
and
the
next
day
and
the
next
and
all
the
week
he
kept
his
post
and
seemed
indifferent
to
feeding
himself
soon
starvation
and
worry
began
to
tell
on
him
he
grew
thin
and
no
one
could
touch
him
and
any
attempt
to
interfere
with
his
daily
occupation
of
roused
him
to
desperation
day
after
day
week
after
week
wully
watched
and
waited
for
his
master
who
never
came
the
ferry
men
learned
to
respect
wully
fidelity
at
first
he
scorned
their
proffered
food
and
shelter
and
lived
no
one
knew
how
but
starved
to
it
at
last
he
accepted
the
gifts
and
learned
to
tolerate
the
givers
although
embittered
against
the
world
his
heart
was
true
to
his
worthless
master
fourteen
months
afterward
i
made
his
acquaintance
he
was
still
on
rigid
duty
at
his
post
he
had
regained
his
good
looks
his
bright
keen
face
set
off
by
his
white
ruff
and
pricked
ears
made
a
dog
to
catch
the
eye
anywhere
but
he
gave
me
no
second
glance
once
he
found
my
legs
were
not
those
he
sought
and
in
spite
of
my
friendly
overtures
during
the
ten
months
following
that
he
continued
his
watch
i
got
no
farther
into
his
confidence
than
any
other
stranger
for
two
whole
years
did
this
devoted
creature
attend
that
ferry
there
was
only
one
thing
to
prevent
him
going
home
to
the
hills
not
the
distance
nor
the
chance
of
getting
lost
but
the
conviction
that
robin
the
godlike
robin
wished
him
to
stay
by
the
ferry
and
he
stayed
but
he
crossed
the
water
as
often
as
he
felt
it
would
serve
his
purpose
the
fare
for
a
dog
was
one
penny
and
it
was
calculated
that
wully
owed
the
company
hundreds
of
pounds
before
he
gave
up
his
quest
he
never
failed
to
sense
every
pair
of
nethers
that
crossed
the
gangplank
legs
by
computation
had
been
pronounced
upon
by
this
expert
but
all
to
no
purpose
his
unswerving
fidelity
never
faltered
though
his
temper
was
obviously
souring
under
the
long
strain
we
had
never
heard
what
became
of
robin
but
one
day
a
sturdy
drover
strode
down
the
and
wully
mechanically
assaying
the
new
personality
suddenly
started
his
mane
bristled
he
trembled
a
low
growl
escaped
him
and
he
fixed
his
every
sense
on
the
drover
one
of
the
ferry
hands
not
understanding
called
to
the
stranger
hoot
mon
ye
maunna
hort
oor
dawg
whaes
hortin
ye
fule
he
is
mair
like
to
hort
me
but
further
explanation
was
not
necessary
wully
manner
had
wholly
changed
he
fawned
on
the
drover
and
his
tail
was
wagging
violently
for
the
first
time
in
years
a
few
words
made
it
all
clear
dorley
the
drover
had
known
robin
very
well
and
the
mittens
and
comforter
he
wore
were
of
robin
own
make
and
had
once
been
part
of
his
wardrobe
wully
recognized
the
traces
of
his
master
and
despairing
of
any
nearer
approach
to
his
lost
idol
he
abandoned
his
post
at
the
ferry
and
plainly
announced
his
intention
of
sticking
to
the
owner
of
the
mittens
and
dorley
was
well
pleased
to
take
wully
along
to
his
home
among
the
hills
of
derbyshire
where
he
became
once
more
a
in
charge
of
a
flock
ii
monsaldale
is
one
of
the
valleys
in
derbyshire
the
pig
and
whistle
is
its
single
but
celebrated
inn
and
jo
greatorex
the
landlord
is
a
shrewd
and
sturdy
yorkshireman
nature
meant
him
for
a
frontiersman
but
circumstances
made
him
an
innkeeper
and
his
inborn
tastes
made
him
a
well
never
mind
there
was
a
great
deal
of
poaching
done
in
that
country
wully
new
home
was
on
the
upland
east
of
the
valley
above
jo
inn
and
that
fact
was
not
without
weight
in
bringing
me
to
monsaldale
his
master
dorley
farmed
in
a
small
way
on
the
lowland
and
on
the
moors
had
a
large
number
of
sheep
these
wully
guarded
with
his
sagacity
watching
them
while
they
fed
and
bringing
them
to
the
fold
at
night
he
was
reserved
and
preoccupied
for
a
dog
and
rather
too
ready
to
show
his
teeth
to
strangers
but
he
was
so
unremitting
in
his
attention
to
his
flock
that
dorley
did
not
lose
a
lamb
that
year
although
the
neighboring
farmers
paid
the
usual
tribute
to
eagles
and
to
foxes
the
dales
are
poor
country
at
best
the
rocky
ridges
high
stone
walls
and
precipices
are
too
numerous
to
please
the
riders
and
the
final
retreats
in
the
rocks
are
so
plentiful
that
it
was
a
marvel
the
foxes
did
not
overrun
monsaldale
but
they
did
there
had
been
but
little
reason
for
complaint
until
the
year
when
a
sly
old
fox
quartered
himself
on
the
fat
parish
like
a
mouse
inside
a
cheese
and
laughed
equally
at
the
hounds
of
the
huntsmen
and
the
lurchers
of
the
farmers
he
was
several
times
run
by
the
peak
hounds
and
escaped
by
making
for
the
devil
hole
once
in
this
gorge
where
the
cracks
in
the
rocks
extend
unknown
distances
he
was
safe
the
country
folk
began
to
see
something
more
than
chance
in
the
fact
that
he
always
escaped
at
the
devil
hole
and
when
one
of
the
hounds
who
nearly
caught
this
fox
soon
after
went
mad
it
removed
all
doubt
as
to
the
spiritual
paternity
of
said
fox
he
continued
his
career
of
rapine
making
audacious
raids
and
escapes
and
finally
began
as
do
many
old
foxes
to
kill
from
a
mania
for
slaughter
thus
it
was
that
digby
lost
ten
lambs
in
one
night
carroll
lost
seven
the
next
night
later
the
vicarage
was
wholly
devastated
and
scarcely
a
night
passed
but
someone
in
the
region
had
to
report
a
carnage
of
poultry
lambs
or
sheep
and
finally
even
calves
of
course
all
the
slaughter
was
attributed
to
this
one
fox
of
the
devil
hole
it
was
known
only
that
he
was
a
very
large
fox
at
least
one
that
made
a
very
large
track
he
never
was
clearly
seen
even
by
the
huntsmen
and
it
was
noticed
that
thunder
and
bell
the
stanchest
hounds
in
the
pack
had
refused
to
tongue
or
even
to
follow
the
trail
when
he
was
hunted
his
reputation
for
madness
sufficed
to
make
the
master
of
the
peak
hounds
avoid
the
neighborhood
the
farmers
in
monsaldale
led
by
jo
agreed
among
themselves
that
if
it
would
only
come
on
a
snow
they
would
assemble
and
beat
the
whole
country
and
in
defiance
of
all
rules
of
the
hunt
get
rid
of
the
fox
in
any
way
they
could
but
the
snow
did
not
come
and
the
gentleman
lived
his
life
notwithstanding
his
madness
he
did
not
lack
method
he
never
came
two
successive
nights
to
the
same
farm
he
never
ate
where
he
killed
and
he
never
left
a
track
that
betrayed
his
he
usually
finished
up
his
trail
on
the
turf
or
on
a
public
highway
once
i
saw
him
i
was
walking
to
monsaldale
from
bakewell
late
one
night
during
a
heavy
storm
and
as
i
turned
the
corner
of
stead
there
was
a
vivid
flash
of
lightning
by
its
light
there
was
fixed
on
my
retina
a
picture
that
made
me
start
sitting
on
his
haunches
by
the
roadside
twenty
yards
away
was
a
very
large
fox
gazing
at
me
with
malignant
eyes
and
licking
his
muzzle
in
a
suggestive
manner
all
this
i
saw
but
no
more
and
might
have
forgotten
it
or
thought
myself
mistaken
but
the
next
morning
in
that
very
fold
were
found
the
bodies
of
lambs
and
sheep
and
the
unmistakable
signs
that
brought
home
the
crime
to
the
marauder
there
was
only
one
man
who
escaped
and
that
was
dorley
this
was
the
more
remarkable
because
he
lived
in
the
centre
of
the
region
raided
and
within
one
mile
of
the
devil
hole
faithful
wully
proved
himself
worth
all
the
dogs
in
the
neighborhood
night
after
night
he
brought
in
the
sheep
and
never
one
was
missing
the
mad
fox
might
prowl
about
the
dorley
homestead
if
he
wished
but
wully
shrewd
brave
active
wully
was
more
than
a
match
for
him
and
not
only
saved
his
master
flock
but
himself
escaped
with
a
whole
skin
everyone
entertained
a
profound
respect
for
him
and
he
might
have
been
a
popular
pet
but
for
his
temper
which
never
genial
became
more
and
more
crabbed
he
seemed
to
like
dorley
and
huldah
dorley
eldest
daughter
a
shrewd
handsome
young
woman
who
in
the
capacity
of
general
manager
of
the
house
was
special
guardian
the
other
members
of
dorley
family
wully
learned
to
tolerate
but
the
rest
of
the
world
men
and
dogs
he
seemed
to
hate
his
uncanny
disposition
was
well
shown
in
the
last
meeting
i
had
with
him
i
was
walking
on
a
pathway
across
the
moor
behind
dorley
house
wully
was
lying
on
the
doorstep
as
i
drew
near
he
arose
and
without
appearing
to
see
me
trotted
toward
my
pathway
and
placed
himself
across
it
about
ten
yards
ahead
of
me
there
he
stood
silently
and
intently
regarding
the
distant
moor
his
slightly
bristling
mane
the
only
sign
that
he
had
not
been
suddenly
turned
to
stone
he
did
not
stir
as
i
came
up
and
not
wishing
to
quarrel
i
stepped
around
past
his
nose
and
walked
on
wully
at
once
left
his
position
and
in
the
same
eerie
silence
trotted
on
some
twenty
feet
and
again
stood
across
the
pathway
once
more
i
came
up
and
stepping
into
the
grass
brushed
past
his
nose
instantly
but
without
a
sound
he
seized
my
left
heel
i
kicked
out
with
the
other
foot
but
he
escaped
not
having
a
stick
i
flung
a
large
stone
at
him
he
leaped
forward
and
the
stone
struck
him
in
the
ham
bowling
him
over
into
a
ditch
he
gasped
out
a
savage
growl
as
he
fell
but
scrambled
out
of
the
ditch
and
limped
away
in
silence
yet
sullen
and
ferocious
as
wully
was
to
the
world
he
was
always
gentle
with
dorley
sheep
many
were
the
tales
of
rescues
told
of
him
many
a
poor
lamb
that
had
fallen
into
a
pond
or
hole
would
have
perished
but
for
his
timely
and
sagacious
aid
many
a
ewe
did
he
turn
right
side
up
while
his
keen
eye
discerned
and
his
fierce
courage
baffled
every
eagle
that
had
appeared
on
the
moor
in
his
time
iii
the
monsaldale
farmers
were
still
paying
their
nightly
tribute
to
the
mad
fox
when
the
snow
came
late
in
december
poor
widow
cot
lost
her
entire
flock
of
twenty
sheep
and
the
fiery
cross
went
forth
early
in
the
morning
with
guns
unconcealed
the
burly
farmers
set
out
to
follow
to
the
finish
the
tracks
in
the
snow
those
of
a
very
large
fox
undoubtedly
the
villain
for
a
while
the
trail
was
clear
enough
then
it
came
to
the
river
and
the
habitual
cunning
of
the
animal
was
shown
he
reached
the
water
at
a
long
angle
pointing
down
stream
and
jumped
into
the
shallow
unfrozen
current
but
at
the
other
side
there
was
no
track
leading
out
and
it
was
only
after
long
searching
that
a
quarter
of
a
mile
higher
up
the
stream
they
found
where
he
had
come
out
the
track
then
ran
to
the
top
of
henley
high
stone
wall
where
there
was
no
snow
left
to
tell
tales
but
the
patient
hunters
persevered
when
it
crossed
the
smooth
snow
from
the
wall
to
the
high
road
there
was
a
difference
of
opinion
some
claimed
that
the
track
went
up
others
down
the
road
but
jo
settled
it
and
after
another
long
search
they
found
where
apparently
the
same
trail
though
some
said
a
larger
one
had
left
the
road
to
enter
a
and
leaving
this
without
harming
the
occupants
the
had
stepped
in
the
footmarks
of
a
countryman
thereby
getting
to
the
moor
road
along
which
he
had
trotted
straight
to
dorley
farm
that
day
the
sheep
were
kept
in
on
account
of
the
snow
and
wully
without
his
usual
occupation
was
lying
on
some
planks
in
the
sun
as
the
hunters
drew
near
the
house
he
growled
savagely
and
sneaked
around
to
where
the
sheep
were
jo
greatorex
walked
up
to
where
wully
had
crossed
the
fresh
snow
gave
a
glance
looked
dumbfounded
then
pointing
to
the
retreating
he
said
with
emphasis
lads
we
off
the
track
of
the
fox
but
there
the
killer
of
the
widder
yowes
some
agreed
with
jo
others
recalled
the
doubt
in
the
trail
and
were
for
going
back
to
make
a
fresh
follow
at
this
juncture
dorley
himself
came
out
of
the
house
tom
said
jo
that
dog
o
thine
killed
twenty
of
widder
sheep
last
night

jo
in
vain
the
company
related
the
history
of

morning
tom
swore
that
it
was
nothing
but
a
jealous
conspiracy
to
rob
him
of
wully
wully
sleeps
i
the
kitchen
every
night
never

tom
became
much
excited
over
this
abominable
attempt
against
reputation
and
life
jo
and
his
partisans
got
equally
angry
and
it
was
a
wise
suggestion
of
huldah
that
quieted
them
feyther
said
she
ah
sleep
i
the
kitchen
the
night
if
wully
ae
way
of
gettin
oot
ah
see
it
an
if
he
no
oot
an
killed
on
the
we
ha
proof
it
na
wully
that
night
huldah
stretched
herself
on
the
settee
and
wully
slept
as
usual
underneath
the
table
as
night
wore
on
the
dog
became
restless
he
turned
on
his
bed
and
once
or
twice
got
up
stretched
looked
at
huldah
and
lay
down
again
about
two
he
seemed
no
longer
able
to
resist
some
strange
impulse
he
arose
quietly
looked
toward
the
low
window
then
at
the
motionless
girl
huldah
lay
still
and
breathed
as
though
sleeping
wully
slowly
came
near
and
sniffed
and
breathed
his
doggy
breath
in
her
face
she
made
no
move
he
nudged
her
gently
with
his
nose
then
with
his
sharp
ears
forward
and
his
head
on
one
side
he
studied
her
calm
face
still
no
sign
he
walked
quietly
to
the
window
mounted
the
table
without
noise
placed
his
nose
under
the
and
raised
the
light
frame
until
he
could
put
one
paw
underneath
then
changing
he
put
his
nose
under
the
sash
and
raised
it
high
enough
to
slip
out
easing
down
the
frame
finally
on
his
rump
and
tail
with
an
adroitness
that
told
of
long
practice
then
he
disappeared
into
the
darkness
from
her
couch
huldah
watched
in
amazement
after
waiting
for
some
time
to
make
sure
that
he
was
gone
she
arose
intending
to
call
her
father
at
once
but
on
second
thought
she
decided
to
await
more
conclusive
proof
she
peered
into
the
darkness
but
no
sign
of
wully
was
to
be
seen
she
put
more
wood
on
the
fire
and
lay
down
again
for
over
an
hour
she
lay
wide
awake
listening
to
the
kitchen
clock
and
starting
at
each
trifling
sound
and
wondering
what
the
dog
was
doing
could
it
be
possible
that
he
had
really
killed
the
widow
sheep
then
the
recollection
of
his
gentleness
to
their
own
sheep
came
and
completed
her
perplexity
another
hour
slowly
she
heard
a
slight
sound
at
the
window
that
made
her
heart
jump
the
scratching
sound
was
soon
followed
by
the
lifting
of
the
sash
and
in
a
short
time
wully
was
back
in
the
kitchen
with
the
window
closed
behind
him
by
the
flickering
huldah
could
see
a
strange
wild
gleam
in
his
eye
and
his
jaws
and
snowy
breast
were
dashed
with
fresh
blood
the
dog
ceased
his
slight
panting
as
he
scrutinized
the
girl
then
as
she
did
not
move
he
lay
down
and
began
to
lick
his
paws
and
muzzle
growling
lowly
once
or
twice
as
though
at
the
remembrance
of
some
recent
occurrence
huldah
had
seen
enough
there
could
no
longer
be
any
doubt
that
jo
was
right
and
more
a
new
thought
flashed
into
her
quick
brain
she
realized
that
the
weird
fox
of
monsal
was
before
her
raising
herself
she
looked
straight
at
wully
and
exclaimed
wully
wully
so
it
a
true
oh
wully
ye
terrible
brute
her
voice
was
fiercely
reproachful
it
rang
in
the
quiet
kitchen
and
wully
recoiled
as
though
shot
he
gave
a
desperate
glance
toward
the
closed
window
his
eye
gleamed
and
his
mane
bristled
but
he
cowered
under
her
gaze
and
grovelled
on
the
floor
as
though
begging
for
mercy
slowly
he
crawled
nearer
and
nearer
as
if
to
lick
her
feet
until
quite
close
then
with
the
fury
of
a
tiger
but
without
a
sound
he
sprang
for
her
throat
the
girl
was
taken
unawares
but
she
threw
up
her
arm
in
time
and
wully
long
gleaming
tusks
sank
into
her
flesh
and
grated
on
the
bone
help
help
feyther
feyther
she
shrieked
wully
was
a
light
weight
and
for
a
moment
she
flung
him
off
but
there
could
be
no
mistaking
his
purpose
the
game
was
up
it
was
his
life
or
hers
now
feyther
feyther
she
screamed
as
the
yellow
fury
striving
to
kill
her
bit
and
tore
the
unprotected
hands
that
had
so
often
fed
him
in
vain
she
fought
to
hold
him
off
he
would
soon
have
had
her
by
the
throat
when
in
rushed
dorley
straight
at
him
now
in
the
same
horrid
silence
sprang
wully
and
savagely
tore
him
again
and
again
before
a
deadly
blow
from
the
disabled
him
dashing
him
gasping
and
writhing
on
the
stone
floor
desperate
and
done
for
but
game
and
defiant
to
the
last
another
quick
blow
scattered
his
brains
on
the
hearthstone
where
so
long
he
had
been
a
faithful
and
honored
retainer
and
wully
bright
fierce
trusty
treacherous
wully
quivered
a
moment
then
straightened
out
and
lay
forever
still
redruff
the
story
of
the
don
valley
partridge
i
down
the
wooded
slope
of
taylor
hill
the
mother
partridge
led
her
brood
down
toward
the
crystal
brook
that
by
some
strange
whim
was
called
mud
creek
her
little
ones
were
one
day
old
but
already
quick
on
foot
and
she
was
taking
them
for
the
first
time
to
drink
she
walked
slowly
crouching
low
as
she
went
for
the
woods
were
full
of
enemies
she
was
uttering
a
soft
little
cluck
in
her
throat
a
call
to
the
little
balls
of
mottled
down
that
on
their
tiny
pink
legs
came
toddling
after
and
peeping
softly
and
plaintively
if
left
even
a
few
inches
behind
and
seeming
so
fragile
they
made
the
very
chickadees
look
big
and
coarse
there
were
twelve
of
them
but
mother
grouse
watched
them
all
and
she
watched
every
bush
and
tree
and
thicket
and
the
whole
woods
and
the
sky
itself
always
for
enemies
she
seemed
seeking
friends
were
too
scarce
to
be
looked
for
and
an
enemy
she
found
away
across
the
level
beaver
meadow
was
a
great
brute
of
a
fox
he
was
coming
their
way
and
in
a
few
moments
would
surely
wind
them
or
strike
their
trail
there
was
no
time
to
lose
krrr
hide
hide
cried
the
mother
in
a
low
firm
voice
and
the
little
bits
of
things
scarcely
bigger
than
acorns
and
but
a
day
old
scattered
far
a
few
inches
apart
to
hide
one
dived
under
a
leaf
another
between
two
roots
a
third
crawled
into
a
curl
of
birchbark
a
fourth
into
a
hole
and
so
on
till
all
were
hidden
but
one
who
could
find
no
cover
so
squatted
on
a
broad
yellow
chip
and
lay
very
flat
and
closed
his
eyes
very
tight
sure
that
now
he
was
safe
from
being
seen
they
ceased
their
frightened
peeping
and
all
was
still
mother
partridge
flew
straight
toward
the
dreaded
beast
alighted
fearlessly
a
few
yards
to
one
side
of
him
and
then
flung
herself
on
the
ground
flopping
as
though
winged
and
lame
oh
so
dreadfully
lame
and
whining
like
a
distressed
puppy
was
she
begging
for
mercy
mercy
from
a
bloodthirsty
cruel
fox
oh
dear
no
she
was
no
fool
one
often
hears
of
the
cunning
of
the
fox
wait
and
see
what
a
fool
he
is
compared
with
a
elated
at
the
prize
so
suddenly
within
his
reach
the
fox
turned
with
a
dash
and
caught
at
least
no
he
did
quite
catch
the
bird
she
flopped
by
chance
just
a
foot
out
of
reach
he
followed
with
another
jump
and
would
have
seized
her
this
time
surely
but
somehow
a
sapling
came
just
between
and
the
partridge
dragged
herself
awkwardly
away
and
under
a
log
but
the
great
brute
snapped
his
jaws
and
hounded
over
the
log
while
she
seeming
a
trifle
less
lame
made
another
clumsy
forward
spring
and
tumbled
down
a
bank
and
reynard
keenly
following
almost
caught
her
tail
but
oddly
enough
fast
as
he
went
and
leaped
she
still
seemed
just
a
trifle
faster
it
was
most
extraordinary
a
winged
partridge
and
he
reynard
the
had
not
caught
her
in
five
minutes
racing
it
was
really
shameful
but
the
partridge
seemed
to
gain
strength
as
the
fox
put
forth
his
and
after
a
quarter
of
a
mile
race
racing
that
was
somehow
all
away
from
hill
the
bird
got
unaccountably
quite
well
and
rising
with
a
derisive
whirr
flew
off
through
the
woods
leaving
the
fox
utterly
dumfounded
to
realize
that
he
had
been
made
a
fool
of
and
worst
of
all
he
now
remembered
that
this
was
not
the
first
time
he
had
been
served
this
very
trick
though
he
never
knew
the
reason
for
it
meanwhile
mother
partridge
skimmed
in
a
great
circle
and
came
by
a
roundabout
way
back
to
the
little
she
had
left
hidden
in
the
woods
with
a
wild
bird
keen
memory
for
places
she
went
to
the
very
she
last
trod
on
and
stood
for
a
moment
fondly
to
admire
the
perfect
stillness
of
her
children
even
at
her
step
not
one
had
stirred
and
the
little
fellow
on
the
chip
not
so
very
badly
concealed
after
all
had
not
budged
nor
did
he
now
he
only
closed
his
eyes
a
tiny
little
bit
harder
till
the
mother
said
come
children
and
instantly
like
a
fairy
story
every
hole
gave
up
its
little
and
the
wee
fellow
on
the
chip
the
biggest
of
them
all
really
opened
his
eyes
and
ran
to
the
shelter
of
her
broad
tail
with
a
sweet
little
peep
which
an
enemy
could
not
have
heard
three
feet
away
but
which
his
mother
could
not
have
missed
thrice
as
far
and
all
the
other
thimblefuls
of
down
joined
in
and
no
doubt
thought
themselves
dreadfully
noisy
and
were
proportionately
happy
the
sun
was
hot
now
there
was
an
open
space
to
cross
on
the
road
to
the
water
and
after
a
careful
lookout
for
enemies
the
mother
gathered
the
little
things
under
the
shadow
of
her
spread
fantail
and
kept
off
all
danger
of
sunstroke
until
they
reached
the
brier
thicket
by
the
stream
here
a
cottontail
rabbit
leaped
out
and
gave
them
a
great
scare
but
the
flag
of
truce
he
carried
behind
was
enough
he
was
an
old
friend
and
among
other
things
the
little
ones
learned
that
day
that
bunny
always
sails
under
a
flag
of
truce
and
lives
up
to
it
too
and
then
came
the
drink
the
purest
of
living
water
though
silly
men
had
called
it
mud
creek
at
first
the
little
fellows
did
know
how
to
drink
but
they
copied
their
mother
and
soon
learned
to
drink
like
her
and
give
thanks
after
every
sip
there
they
stood
in
a
row
along
the
edge
twelve
little
brown
and
golden
balls
on
little
feet
with
twelve
sweet
little
golden
heads
gravely
bowing
drinking
and
giving
thanks
like
their
mother
then
she
led
them
by
short
stages
keeping
the
cover
to
the
far
side
of
the
where
was
a
great
grassy
dome
the
mother
had
made
a
note
of
this
dome
some
time
before
it
takes
a
number
of
such
domes
to
raise
a
brood
of
partridges
for
this
was
an
ant
nest
the
old
one
stepped
on
top
looked
about
a
moment
then
gave
half
a
dozen
vigorous
rakes
with
her
claws
the
friable
was
broken
open
and
the
earthen
galleries
scattered
in
ruins
down
the
slope
the
ants
swarmed
out
and
quarreled
with
each
other
for
lack
of
a
better
plan
some
ran
around
the
hill
with
vast
energy
and
little
purpose
while
a
few
of
the
more
sensible
began
to
carry
away
fat
white
eggs
but
the
old
partridge
coming
to
the
little
ones
picked
up
one
of
these
bags
and
clucked
and
dropped
it
and
picked
it
up
again
and
again
and
clucked
then
swallowed
it
the
young
ones
stood
around
then
one
little
yellow
fellow
the
one
that
sat
on
the
chip
picked
up
an
dropped
it
a
few
times
then
yielding
to
a
sudden
impulse
swallowed
it
and
so
had
learned
to
eat
within
twenty
minutes
even
the
runt
had
learned
and
a
merry
time
they
had
scrambling
after
the
delicious
eggs
as
their
mother
broke
open
more
and
sent
them
and
their
contents
rolling
down
the
bank
till
every
little
partridge
had
so
crammed
his
little
crop
that
he
was
positively
misshapen
and
could
eat
no
more
then
all
went
cautiously
up
the
stream
and
on
a
sandy
bank
well
screened
by
brambles
they
lay
for
all
that
afternoon
and
learned
how
pleasant
it
was
to
feel
the
cool
powdery
dust
running
between
their
hot
little
toes
with
their
strong
bent
for
copying
they
lay
on
their
sides
like
their
mother
and
scratched
with
their
tiny
feet
and
flopped
with
their
wings
though
they
had
no
wings
to
flop
with
only
a
little
tag
among
the
down
on
each
side
to
show
where
the
wings
would
come
that
night
she
took
them
to
a
dry
thicket
near
by
and
there
among
the
crisp
dead
leaves
that
would
prevent
an
enemy
silent
approach
on
foot
and
under
the
interlacing
briers
that
kept
off
all
foes
of
the
air
she
cradled
them
in
their
nursery
and
rejoiced
in
the
fulness
of
a
mother
joy
over
the
wee
cuddling
things
that
peeped
in
their
sleep
and
snuggled
so
trustfully
against
her
warm
body
ii
the
third
day
the
chicks
were
much
stronger
on
their
feet
they
no
longer
had
to
go
around
an
acorn
they
could
even
scramble
over
and
on
the
little
tags
that
marked
the
places
for
their
wings
were
now
to
be
seen
blue
rows
of
fat
their
start
in
life
was
a
good
mother
good
legs
a
few
reliable
instincts
and
a
germ
of
reason
it
was
instinct
that
is
inherited
habit
which
taught
them
to
hide
at
the
word
from
their
mother
it
was
instinct
that
taught
them
to
follow
her
but
it
was
reason
which
made
them
keep
under
the
shadow
of
her
tail
when
the
sun
was
smiting
down
and
from
that
day
reason
entered
more
and
more
into
their
expanding
lives
next
day
the
had
sprouted
the
tips
of
feathers
on
the
next
the
feathers
were
well
out
and
a
week
later
the
whole
family
of
babies
were
strong
on
the
wing
and
yet
not
all
poor
little
runtie
had
been
sickly
from
the
first
he
bore
his
on
his
back
for
hours
after
he
came
out
he
ran
less
and
cheeped
more
than
his
brothers
and
when
one
evening
at
the
onset
of
a
skunk
the
mother
gave
the
word
kwit
fly
fly
runtie
was
left
behind
and
when
she
gathered
her
brood
on
the
piney
hill
he
was
missing
and
they
saw
him
no
more
meanwhile
their
training
had
gone
on
they
knew
that
the
finest
grasshoppers
abounded
in
the
long
grass
by
the
brook
they
knew
that
the
dropped
fatness
in
the
form
of
smooth
green
worms
they
knew
that
the
dome
of
an
rising
against
the
distant
woods
stood
for
a
garner
of
plenty
they
knew
that
strawberries
though
not
really
insects
were
almost
as
delicious
they
knew
that
the
huge
danaid
butterflies
were
good
safe
game
if
they
could
only
catch
them
and
that
a
slab
of
bark
dropping
from
the
side
of
a
rotten
log
was
sure
to
abound
in
good
things
of
many
different
kinds
and
they
had
learned
also
that
woolly
worms
and
were
better
let
alone
it
was
now
july
the
moon
of
berries
the
chicks
had
grown
and
flourished
amazingly
during
this
last
month
and
were
now
so
large
that
in
her
efforts
to
cover
them
the
mother
was
kept
standing
all
night
they
took
their
daily
but
of
late
had
changed
to
another
higher
on
the
hill
it
was
one
in
use
by
many
different
birds
and
at
first
the
mother
disliked
the
idea
of
such
a
bath
but
the
dust
was
of
such
a
fine
agreeable
quality
and
the
children
led
the
way
with
such
enthusiasm
that
she
forgot
her
mistrust
after
a
fortnight
the
little
ones
began
to
droop
and
she
herself
did
not
feel
very
well
they
were
always
hungry
and
though
they
ate
enormously
they
one
and
all
grew
thinner
and
thinner
the
mother
was
the
last
to
be
affected
but
when
it
came
it
came
as
hard
on
her
a
ravenous
hunger
a
feverish
headache
and
a
wasting
weakness
she
never
knew
the
cause
she
could
not
know
that
the
dust
of
the
that
her
true
instinct
taught
her
to
mistrust
at
first
and
now
again
to
shun
was
sown
with
parasitic
worms
and
that
all
of
the
family
were
infested
no
natural
impulse
is
without
a
purpose
the
knowledge
of
healing
was
only
to
follow
natural
impulse
the
eager
feverish
craving
for
something
she
knew
not
what
led
her
to
eat
or
try
everything
that
looked
eatable
and
to
seek
the
coolest
woods
and
there
she
found
a
deadly
sumac
laden
with
its
poison
fruit
a
month
ago
she
would
have
passed
it
by
but
now
she
tried
the
unattractive
berries
the
acrid
burning
juice
seemed
to
answer
some
strange
demand
of
her
body
she
ate
and
ate
and
all
her
family
joined
in
the
strange
feast
of
physic
no
human
doctor
could
have
hit
it
better
it
proved
a
biting
drastic
purge
the
dreadful
secret
foe
was
downed
the
danger
passed
but
not
for
all
nature
the
old
nurse
had
come
too
late
for
two
of
them
the
weakest
by
inexorable
law
dropped
out
enfeebled
by
the
disease
the
remedy
was
too
severe
for
them
they
drank
and
drank
by
the
stream
and
next
morning
did
not
move
when
the
others
followed
the
mother
strange
vengeance
was
theirs
now
for
a
skunk
the
same
that
could
have
told
where
runtie
went
found
and
devoured
their
bodies
and
died
of
the
poison
they
had
eaten
seven
little
partridges
now
obeyed
the
mother
call
their
individual
characters
were
early
shown
and
now
developed
fast
the
weaklings
were
gone
but
there
were
still
a
fool
and
a
lazy
one
the
mother
could
not
help
caring
for
some
more
than
for
others
and
her
favorite
was
the
biggest
he
who
once
sat
on
the
yellow
chip
for
concealment
he
was
not
only
the
biggest
strongest
and
handsomest
of
the
brood
but
best
of
all
the
most
obedient
his
mother
warning
danger
did
not
always
keep
the
others
from
a
risky
path
or
a
doubtful
food
but
obedience
seemed
natural
to
him
and
he
never
failed
to
respond
to
her
soft
come
and
of
this
obedience
he
reaped
the
reward
for
his
days
were
longest
in
the
land
august
the
molting
moon
went
by
the
young
ones
were
now
three
parts
grown
they
knew
just
enough
to
think
themselves
wonderfully
wise
when
they
were
small
it
was
necessary
to
sleep
on
the
ground
so
their
mother
could
shelter
them
but
now
they
were
too
big
to
need
that
and
the
mother
began
to
introduce
grownup
ways
of
life
it
was
time
to
roost
in
the
trees
the
young
weasels
foxes
skunks
and
minks
were
beginning
to
run
the
ground
grew
more
dangerous
each
night
so
at
sundown
mother
partridge
called
and
flew
into
a
thick
low
tree
the
little
ones
followed
except
one
an
obstinate
little
fool
who
persisted
in
sleeping
on
the
ground
as
heretofore
it
was
all
right
that
time
but
the
next
night
his
brothers
were
awakened
by
his
cries
there
was
a
slight
scuffle
then
stillness
broken
only
by
a
horrid
sound
of
crunching
bones
and
a
smacking
of
lips
they
peered
down
into
the
terrible
darkness
below
where
the
glint
of
two
eyes
and
a
peculiar
musty
smell
told
them
that
a
mink
was
the
killer
of
their
fool
brother
six
little
partridges
now
sat
in
a
row
at
night
with
their
mother
in
the
middle
though
it
was
not
unusual
for
some
little
one
with
cold
feet
to
perch
on
her
back
their
education
went
on
and
about
this
time
they
were
taught
a
partridge
can
rise
on
the
wing
silently
if
it
wishes
but
whirring
is
so
important
at
times
that
all
are
taught
how
and
when
to
rise
on
thundering
wings
many
ends
are
gained
by
the
whirr
it
warns
all
other
partridges
near
that
danger
is
at
hand
it
unnerves
the
gunner
or
it
fixes
the
foe
attention
on
the
whirrer
while
the
others
sneak
off
in
silence
or
by
squatting
escape
notice
a
partridge
adage
might
well
be
and
food
for
every
moon
september
came
with
seeds
and
grain
in
place
of
berries
and
and
gunners
in
place
of
skunks
and
minks
the
partridges
knew
well
what
a
fox
was
but
had
scarcely
seen
a
dog
a
fox
they
knew
they
could
easily
baffle
by
taking
to
a
tree
but
when
in
the
gunner
moon
old
cuddy
came
prowling
through
the
ravine
with
his
yellow
cur
the
mother
spied
the
dog
and
cried
out
kwit
fly
fly
two
of
the
brood
thought
it
a
pity
their
mother
should
lose
her
wits
so
easily
over
a
fox
and
were
pleased
to
show
their
superior
nerve
by
springing
into
a
tree
in
spite
of
her
earnestly
repeated
kwit
and
her
example
of
speeding
away
on
silent
wings
meanwhile
the
strange
fox
came
under
the
tree
and
yapped
and
yapped
at
them
they
were
much
amused
at
him
and
at
their
mother
and
brothers
so
much
that
they
never
noticed
a
rustling
in
the
bushes
till
there
was
a
loud
bang
bang
and
down
fell
two
bloody
flopping
partridges
to
be
seized
and
mangled
by
the
yellow
cur
until
the
gunner
ran
from
the
bushes
and
rescued
the
remains
iii
cuddy
lived
in
a
wretched
shanty
near
the
don
north
of
toronto
his
was
what
greek
philosophy
would
have
demonstrated
to
be
an
ideal
existence
he
had
no
wealth
no
taxes
no
social
pretensions
and
no
property
to
speak
of
his
life
was
made
up
of
a
very
little
work
and
a
great
deal
of
play
with
as
much
outdoor
life
as
he
chose
he
considered
himself
a
true
sportsman
because
he
was
o
huntin
and
a
sight
comfort
out
of
seein
the
critters
hit
the
mud
when
his
gun
was
fired
the
neighbors
called
him
a
squatter
and
looked
on
him
merely
as
an
anchored
tramp
he
shot
and
trapped
the
year
round
and
varied
his
game
somewhat
with
the
season
perforce
but
had
been
heard
to
remark
he
could
tell
the
month
by
the
o
the
partridges
if
he
did
happen
to
know
by
the
almanac
this
no
doubt
showed
keen
observation
but
was
also
unfortunate
proof
of
something
not
so
creditable
the
lawful
season
for
murdering
partridges
began
september
but
there
was
nothing
surprising
in
cuddy
being
out
a
fortnight
ahead
of
time
yet
he
managed
to
escape
punishment
year
after
year
and
even
contrived
to
pose
in
a
newspaper
interview
as
an
interesting
character
he
rarely
shot
on
the
wing
preferring
to
pot
his
birds
which
was
not
easy
to
do
when
the
leaves
were
on
and
accounted
for
the
brood
in
the
third
ravine
going
so
long
unharmed
but
the
near
prospect
of
other
gunners
finding
them
now
had
stirred
him
to
go
after
mess
o
birds
he
had
heard
no
roar
of
wings
when
the
led
off
her
four
survivors
so
pocketed
the
two
he
had
killed
and
returned
to
the
shanty
the
little
grouse
thus
learned
that
a
dog
is
not
a
fox
and
must
be
differently
played
and
an
old
lesson
was
yet
more
deeply
graven
is
long
life
the
rest
of
september
was
passed
in
keeping
quietly
out
of
the
way
of
gunners
as
well
as
some
old
enemies
they
still
roosted
on
the
long
thin
branches
of
the
hardwood
trees
among
the
thickest
leaves
which
protected
them
from
foes
in
the
air
the
height
saved
them
from
foes
on
the
ground
and
left
them
nothing
to
fear
but
coons
whose
slow
heavy
tread
on
the
timber
boughs
never
failed
to
give
them
timely
warning
but
the
leaves
were
falling
now
every
month
its
foes
and
its
food
this
was
nut
time
and
it
was
owl
time
too
barred
owls
coming
down
from
the
north
doubled
or
trebled
the
owl
population
the
nights
were
getting
frosty
and
the
coons
less
dangerous
so
the
mother
changed
the
place
of
roosting
to
the
thickest
foliage
of
a
only
one
of
the
brood
disregarded
the
warning
kreet
he
stuck
to
his
swinging
now
nearly
naked
and
a
great
owl
bore
him
off
before
morning
mother
and
three
young
ones
now
were
left
but
they
were
as
big
as
she
was
indeed
one
the
eldest
he
of
the
chip
was
bigger
their
ruffs
had
begun
to
show
just
the
tips
to
tell
what
they
would
be
like
when
grown
and
not
a
little
proud
they
were
of
them
the
ruff
is
to
the
partridge
what
the
train
is
to
the
peacock
his
chief
beauty
and
his
pride
a
hen
ruff
is
black
with
a
slight
green
gloss
a
cock
is
much
larger
and
blacker
and
is
glossed
with
more
vivid
once
in
a
while
a
partridge
is
born
of
unusual
size
and
vigor
whose
ruff
is
not
only
larger
but
by
a
peculiar
kind
of
intensification
is
of
a
deep
coppery
red
iridescent
with
violet
green
and
gold
such
a
bird
is
sure
to
be
a
wonder
to
all
who
know
him
and
the
little
one
who
had
squatted
on
the
chip
and
had
always
done
what
he
was
told
developed
before
the
acorn
moon
had
changed
into
all
the
glory
of
a
gold
and
copper
ruff
for
this
was
redruff
the
famous
partridge
of
the
don
valley
iv
one
day
late
in
the
acorn
moon
that
is
about
as
the
grouse
family
were
basking
with
full
crops
near
a
great
pine
log
on
the
sunlit
edge
of
the
they
heard
the
bang
of
a
gun
and
redruff
acting
on
some
impulse
from
within
leaped
on
the
log
strutted
up
and
down
a
couple
of
times
then
yielding
to
the
elation
of
the
bright
clear
bracing
air
he
whirred
his
wings
in
loud
defiance
then
giving
fuller
vent
to
this
expression
of
vigor
just
as
a
colt
frisks
to
show
how
well
he
feels
he
whirred
yet
more
loudly
until
unwittingly
he
found
himself
drumming
and
tickled
with
the
discovery
of
his
new
power
thumped
the
air
again
and
again
till
he
filled
the
near
woods
with
the
loud
tattoo
of
the
fully
grown
his
brother
and
sister
heard
and
looked
on
with
admiration
and
surprise
so
did
his
mother
but
from
that
time
she
began
to
be
a
little
afraid
of
him
in
early
november
comes
the
moon
of
a
weird
foe
by
a
strange
law
of
nature
not
wholly
without
parallel
among
mankind
all
partridges
go
crazy
in
the
november
moon
of
their
first
year
they
become
possessed
of
a
mad
hankering
to
get
away
somewhere
it
does
not
matter
much
where
and
the
wisest
of
them
do
all
sorts
of
foolish
things
at
this
period
they
go
drifting
perhaps
at
speed
over
the
country
by
night
and
are
cut
in
two
by
wires
or
dash
into
lighthouses
or
locomotive
headlights
daylight
finds
them
in
all
sorts
of
absurd
places
in
buildings
in
open
marshes
perched
on
telephone
wires
in
a
great
city
or
even
on
board
of
coasting
vessels
the
craze
seems
to
be
a
relic
of
a
bygone
habit
of
migration
and
it
has
at
least
one
good
effect
it
breaks
up
the
families
and
prevents
the
constant
intermarrying
which
would
surely
be
fatal
to
their
race
it
always
takes
the
young
badly
their
first
year
and
they
may
have
it
again
the
second
fall
for
it
is
very
catching
but
in
the
third
season
it
is
practically
unknown
redruff
mother
knew
it
was
coming
as
soon
as
she
saw
the
frost
grapes
blackening
and
the
maples
shedding
their
crimson
and
gold
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
care
for
their
health
and
keep
them
in
the
quietest
part
of
the
woods
the
first
sign
of
it
came
when
a
flock
of
wild
geese
went
honking
southward
overhead
the
young
ones
had
never
before
seen
such
hawks
and
were
afraid
of
them
but
seeing
that
their
mother
had
no
fear
they
took
courage
and
watched
them
with
intense
interest
was
it
the
wild
clanging
cry
that
moved
them
or
was
it
solely
the
inner
prompting
then
come
to
the
surface
a
strange
longing
to
follow
took
possession
of
each
of
the
young
ones
they
watched
those
arrowy
trumpeters
fading
away
to
the
south
and
sought
out
higher
perches
to
watch
them
farther
yet
and
from
that
time
things
were
no
more
the
same
the
november
moon
was
waxing
and
when
it
was
full
the
november
madness
came
the
least
vigorous
of
the
flock
were
most
affected
the
little
family
was
scattered
redruff
himself
flew
on
several
long
erratic
night
journeys
the
impulse
took
him
southward
but
there
lay
the
boundless
stretch
of
lake
ontario
so
he
turned
again
and
the
waning
of
the
mad
moon
found
him
once
more
in
the
mud
creek
glen
but
absolutely
alone
v
food
grew
scarce
as
winter
wore
on
redruff
clung
to
the
old
ravine
and
the
piney
sides
of
taylor
hill
but
every
month
brought
its
food
and
its
foes
the
mad
moon
brought
madness
solitude
and
grapes
the
snow
moon
came
with
rosehips
and
the
stormy
moon
brought
browse
of
birch
and
silver
storms
that
sheathed
the
woods
in
ice
and
made
it
hard
to
keep
one
perch
while
pulling
off
the
frozen
buds
redruff
beak
grew
terribly
worn
with
the
work
so
that
even
when
closed
there
was
still
an
opening
through
behind
the
hook
but
nature
had
prepared
him
for
the
slippery
footing
his
toes
so
slim
and
trim
in
september
had
sprouted
rows
of
sharp
horny
points
and
these
grew
with
the
growing
cold
till
the
first
snow
had
found
him
fully
equipped
with
and
icecreepers
the
cold
weather
had
driven
away
most
of
the
hawks
and
owls
and
made
it
impossible
for
his
enemies
to
approach
unseen
so
that
things
were
nearly
balanced
his
flight
in
search
of
food
had
daily
led
him
farther
on
till
he
had
discovered
and
explored
the
rosedale
creek
with
its
banks
of
and
castle
frank
with
its
grapes
and
rowan
berries
as
well
as
chester
woods
where
amelanchier
and
swung
their
and
checkerberries
glowed
beneath
the
snow
he
soon
found
out
that
for
some
strange
reason
men
with
guns
did
not
go
within
the
high
fence
of
castle
frank
so
among
these
scenes
he
lived
his
life
learning
new
places
new
foods
and
grew
wiser
and
more
beautiful
every
day
he
was
quite
alone
so
far
as
kindred
were
concerned
but
that
scarcely
seemed
a
hardship
wherever
he
went
he
could
see
the
jolly
chickadees
scrambling
merrily
about
and
he
remembered
the
time
when
they
had
seemed
such
big
important
creatures
they
were
the
most
absurdly
cheerful
things
in
the
woods
before
the
autumn
was
fairly
over
they
had
begun
to
sing
their
famous
refrain
soon
and
kept
it
up
with
good
heart
more
or
less
all
through
the
winter
direst
storms
till
at
length
the
waning
of
the
hunger
moon
our
february
seemed
really
to
lend
some
point
to
the
ditty
and
they
redoubled
their
optimistic
announcement
to
the
world
in
an
mood
soon
good
support
was
found
for
the
sun
gained
strength
and
melted
the
snow
from
the
southern
slope
of
castle
frank
hill
and
exposed
great
banks
of
fragrant
wintergreen
whose
berries
were
a
bounteous
feast
for
redruff
and
ending
the
hard
work
of
pulling
frozen
browse
gave
his
bill
the
needed
chance
to
grow
into
its
proper
shape
again
very
soon
the
first
bluebird
came
flying
over
and
warbled
as
he
flew
spring
is
coming
the
sun
kept
gaining
and
early
one
day
in
the
dark
of
the
wakening
moon
of
march
there
was
a
loud
caw
and
old
the
came
swinging
along
from
the
south
at
the
head
of
his
troops
and
officially
announced
spring
has
all
nature
seemed
to
respond
to
this
the
opening
of
the
birds
new
year
and
yet
it
was
something
within
that
chiefly
seemed
to
move
them
the
chickadees
went
simply
wild
they
sang
their
now
spring
now
now
spring
now
now
so
persistently
that
one
wondered
how
they
found
time
to
get
a
living
and
redruff
felt
it
thrill
him
through
and
through
he
sprang
with
joyous
vigor
on
a
stump
and
sent
rolling
down
the
little
valley
again
and
again
a
thundering
thump
thump
thunderrrrrrrrr
that
wakened
dull
echoes
as
it
rolled
and
voiced
his
gladness
in
the
coming
of
the
spring
away
down
the
valley
was
cuddy
shanty
he
heard
the
on
the
still
morning
air
and
there
was
a
cock
patridge
to
git
and
came
sneaking
up
the
ravine
with
his
gun
but
redruff
skimmed
away
in
silence
nor
rested
till
once
more
in
mud
creek
glen
and
there
he
mounted
the
very
log
where
first
he
had
drummed
and
rolled
his
loud
tattoo
again
and
again
till
a
small
boy
who
had
taken
a
short
cut
to
the
mill
through
the
woods
ran
home
badly
scared
to
tell
his
mother
he
was
sure
the
indians
were
on
the
for
he
heard
their
beating
in
the
glen
why
does
a
happy
boy
holla
why
does
a
lonesome
youth
sigh
they
know
any
more
than
redruff
knew
why
every
day
now
he
mounted
some
dead
log
and
thumped
and
thundered
to
the
woods
then
strutted
and
admired
his
gorgeous
blazing
ruffs
as
they
flashed
their
jewels
in
the
sunlight
and
then
thundered
out
again
whence
now
came
the
strange
wish
for
someone
else
to
admire
the
plumes
and
why
had
such
a
notion
never
come
till
the
pussywillow
moon
thump
thump
he
rumbled
again
and
again
day
after
day
he
sought
the
favorite
log
and
a
new
beauty
a
comb
grew
out
above
each
clear
keen
eye
and
the
clumsy
snowshoes
were
wholly
shed
from
his
feet
his
ruff
grew
finer
his
eye
brighter
and
his
whole
appearance
splendid
to
behold
as
he
strutted
and
flashed
in
the
sun
but
oh
he
was
so
lonesome
now
yet
what
could
he
do
but
blindly
vent
his
hankering
in
this
daily
till
on
a
day
early
in
loveliest
may
when
the
trilliums
had
fringed
his
log
with
silver
stars
and
he
had
drummed
and
longed
then
drummed
again
his
keen
ear
caught
a
sound
a
gentle
footfall
in
the
brush
he
turned
to
a
statue
and
watched
he
knew
he
had
been
watched
could
it
be
possible
yes
there
it
was
a
form
another
a
shy
little
lady
grouse
now
bashfully
seeking
to
hide
in
a
moment
he
was
by
her
side
his
whole
nature
swamped
by
a
new
feeling
burnt
up
with
thirst
a
cooling
spring
in
sight
and
how
he
spread
and
flashed
his
proud
array
how
came
he
to
know
that
that
would
please
he
puffed
his
plumes
and
contrived
to
stand
just
right
to
catch
the
sun
and
he
strutted
and
uttered
a
low
soft
chuckle
that
must
have
been
as
good
as
the
nothings
of
another
race
for
clearly
now
her
heart
was
won
won
really
days
ago
if
only
he
had
known
for
full
three
days
she
had
come
at
the
loud
tattoo
and
coyly
admired
him
from
afar
and
felt
a
little
piqued
that
he
had
not
yet
found
out
her
so
close
at
hand
so
it
was
not
quite
all
mischance
perhaps
that
little
stamp
that
caught
his
ear
but
now
she
meekly
bowed
her
head
with
sweet
submissive
grace
the
desert
passed
the
wanderer
found
the
spring
at
last
oh
those
were
bright
glad
days
in
the
lovely
glen
of
the
unlovely
name
the
sun
was
never
so
bright
and
the
piney
air
was
balmier
sweet
than
dreams
and
that
great
noble
bird
came
daily
on
his
log
sometimes
with
her
and
sometimes
quite
alone
and
drummed
for
very
joy
of
being
alive
but
why
sometimes
alone
why
not
forever
with
his
brownie
bride
why
should
she
stay
to
feast
and
play
with
him
for
hours
then
take
some
stealthy
chance
to
slip
away
and
see
him
no
more
for
hours
or
till
next
day
when
his
martial
music
from
the
log
announced
him
restless
for
her
quick
return
there
was
a
woodland
mystery
here
he
could
not
clear
why
should
her
stay
with
him
grow
daily
less
till
it
was
down
to
minutes
and
one
day
at
last
she
never
came
at
all
nor
the
next
nor
the
next
and
redruff
wild
careered
on
lightning
wing
and
drummed
on
the
old
log
then
away
on
another
log
and
skimmed
the
hill
to
another
ravine
to
drum
and
drum
but
on
the
fourth
day
when
he
came
and
loudly
called
her
as
of
old
at
their
earliest
tryst
he
heard
a
sound
in
the
bushes
as
at
first
and
there
was
his
missing
brownie
bride
with
ten
little
peeping
partridges
following
after
redruff
skimmed
to
her
side
terribly
frightening
the
downlings
and
was
just
a
little
dashed
to
find
the
brood
with
claims
far
stronger
than
his
own
but
he
soon
accepted
the
change
and
thenceforth
joined
himself
to
the
brood
caring
for
them
as
his
father
never
had
for
him
vi
good
fathers
are
rare
in
the
grouse
world
the
builds
her
nest
and
hatches
out
her
young
without
help
she
even
hides
the
place
of
the
nest
from
the
father
and
meets
him
only
at
the
and
the
or
perhaps
the
which
is
the
of
the
grouse
kind
when
brownie
little
ones
came
out
they
had
filled
her
every
thought
even
to
the
forgetting
of
their
splendid
father
but
on
the
third
day
when
they
were
strong
enough
she
had
taken
them
with
her
at
the
father
call
some
fathers
take
no
interest
in
their
little
ones
but
redruff
joined
at
once
to
help
brownie
in
the
task
of
rearing
the
brood
they
had
learned
to
eat
and
drink
just
as
their
father
had
learned
long
ago
and
could
toddle
along
with
their
mother
leading
the
way
while
the
father
ranged
near
by
or
followed
far
behind
the
very
next
day
as
they
went
from
the
down
toward
the
creek
in
a
somewhat
string
like
beads
with
a
big
one
at
each
end
a
red
squirrel
peeping
around
a
watched
the
procession
of
downlings
with
the
runtie
straggling
far
in
the
rear
redruff
yards
behind
preening
his
feathers
on
a
high
log
had
escaped
the
eye
of
the
squirrel
whose
strange
perverted
thirst
for
birdling
blood
was
roused
at
what
seemed
so
fair
a
chance
with
murderous
intent
to
cut
off
the
hindmost
straggler
he
made
a
dash
brownie
could
not
have
seen
him
until
too
late
but
redruff
did
he
flew
for
that
cutthroat
his
weapons
were
his
fists
that
is
the
of
the
wings
and
what
a
blow
he
could
strike
at
the
first
onset
he
struck
the
squirrel
square
on
the
end
of
the
nose
his
weakest
spot
and
sent
him
reeling
he
staggered
and
wriggled
into
a
where
he
had
expected
to
carry
the
little
grouse
and
there
lay
gasping
with
red
drops
trickling
down
his
wicked
snout
the
partridges
left
him
lying
there
and
what
became
of
him
they
never
knew
but
he
troubled
them
no
more
the
family
went
on
toward
the
water
but
a
cow
had
left
deep
tracks
in
the
sandy
loam
and
into
one
of
these
fell
one
of
the
chicks
and
peeped
in
dire
distress
when
he
found
he
could
not
get
out
this
was
a
fix
neither
old
one
seemed
to
know
what
to
do
but
as
they
trampled
vainly
round
the
edge
the
sandy
bank
caved
in
and
running
down
formed
a
long
slope
up
which
the
young
one
ran
and
rejoined
his
brothers
under
the
broad
veranda
of
their
mother
tail
brownie
was
a
bright
little
mother
of
small
stature
but
keen
of
wit
and
sense
and
was
night
and
day
alert
to
care
for
her
darling
chicks
how
proudly
she
stepped
and
clucked
through
the
arching
woods
with
her
dainty
brood
behind
her
how
she
strained
her
little
brown
tail
almost
to
a
to
give
them
a
broader
shade
and
never
flinched
at
sight
of
any
foe
but
held
ready
to
fight
or
fly
whichever
seemed
the
best
for
her
little
ones
before
the
chicks
could
fly
they
had
a
meeting
with
old
cuddy
though
it
was
june
he
was
out
with
his
gun
up
the
third
ravine
he
went
and
tike
his
dog
ranging
ahead
came
so
dangerously
near
the
brownie
brood
that
redruff
ran
to
meet
him
and
by
the
old
but
never
failing
trick
led
him
on
a
foolish
chase
away
back
down
the
valley
of
the
don
but
cuddy
as
it
chanced
came
right
along
straight
for
the
brood
and
brownie
giving
the
signal
to
the
children
krrr
hide
hide
ran
to
lead
the
man
away
just
as
her
mate
had
led
the
dog
full
of
a
mother
devoted
love
and
skilled
in
the
learning
of
the
woods
she
ran
in
silence
till
quite
near
then
sprang
with
a
roar
of
wings
right
in
his
face
and
tumbling
on
the
leaves
she
shammed
a
lameness
that
for
a
moment
deceived
the
poacher
but
when
she
dragged
one
wing
and
whined
about
his
feet
then
slowly
crawled
away
he
knew
just
what
it
meant
that
it
was
all
a
trick
to
lead
him
from
her
brood
and
he
struck
at
her
a
savage
blow
but
little
brownie
was
quick
she
avoided
the
blow
and
limped
behind
a
sapling
there
to
beat
herself
upon
the
leaves
again
in
sore
distress
and
seem
so
lame
that
cuddy
made
another
try
to
strike
her
down
with
a
stick
but
she
moved
in
time
to
balk
him
and
bravely
steadfast
still
to
lead
him
from
her
helpless
little
ones
she
flung
herself
before
him
and
beat
her
gentle
breast
upon
the
ground
and
moaned
as
though
begging
for
mercy
and
cuddy
failing
again
to
strike
her
raised
his
gun
and
firing
charge
enough
to
kill
a
bear
he
blew
poor
brave
devoted
brownie
into
quivering
bloody
rags
this
gunner
brute
knew
the
young
must
be
hiding
near
so
looked
about
to
find
them
but
no
one
moved
or
peeped
he
saw
not
one
but
as
he
tramped
about
with
heedless
hateful
feet
he
crossed
and
crossed
again
their
and
more
than
one
of
the
silent
little
sufferers
he
trampled
to
death
and
neither
knew
nor
cared
redruff
had
taken
the
yellow
brute
away
off
downstream
and
now
returned
to
where
he
left
his
mate
the
murderer
had
gone
taking
her
remains
to
be
thrown
to
the
dog
redruff
sought
about
and
found
the
bloody
spot
with
feathers
brownie
feathers
scattered
around
and
now
he
knew
the
meaning
of
that
shot
who
can
tell
what
his
horror
and
his
mourning
were
the
outward
signs
were
few
some
minutes
dumbly
gazing
at
the
place
with
downcast
draggled
look
and
then
a
change
at
the
thought
of
their
helpless
brood
back
to
the
he
went
and
called
the
kreet
did
every
grave
give
up
its
little
inmate
at
the
magic
word
no
barely
more
than
half
six
little
balls
of
down
unveiled
their
lustrous
eyes
and
rising
ran
to
meet
him
but
four
feathered
little
bodies
had
found
their
graves
indeed
redruff
called
again
and
again
till
he
was
sure
that
all
who
could
respond
had
come
and
led
them
from
that
dreadful
place
far
far
away
where
fences
and
bramble
thickets
were
found
to
offer
a
less
grateful
but
more
reliable
shelter
here
the
brood
grew
and
were
trained
by
their
father
just
as
his
mother
had
trained
him
though
wider
knowledge
and
experience
gave
him
many
advantages
he
knew
so
well
the
country
round
and
all
the
and
how
to
meet
the
ills
that
harass
that
the
summer
passed
and
not
a
chick
was
lost
they
grew
and
flourished
and
when
the
gunner
moon
arrived
they
were
a
fine
family
of
six
grouse
with
redruff
splendid
in
his
gleaming
copper
feathers
at
their
head
he
had
ceased
to
drum
during
the
summer
after
the
loss
of
brownie
but
drumming
is
to
the
partridge
what
singing
is
to
the
lark
while
it
is
his
lovesong
it
is
also
an
expression
of
exuberance
born
of
health
and
when
the
molt
was
over
and
september
food
and
weather
had
renewed
his
splendid
plumes
and
braced
himself
up
again
his
spirits
revived
and
finding
himself
one
day
near
the
old
log
he
mounted
impulsively
and
drummed
again
and
again
from
that
time
he
often
drummed
while
his
children
sat
around
or
one
who
showed
his
father
blood
would
mount
some
nearby
stump
or
stone
and
beat
the
air
in
the
loud
tattoo
the
black
grapes
and
the
mad
moon
now
came
on
but
redruff
brood
were
of
a
vigorous
stock
their
robust
health
meant
robust
wits
and
though
they
got
the
craze
it
passed
within
a
week
and
only
three
had
flown
away
for
good
redruff
with
his
remaining
three
was
living
in
the
glen
when
the
snow
came
it
was
light
flaky
snow
and
as
the
weather
was
not
very
cold
the
family
squatted
for
the
night
under
the
low
flat
boughs
of
a
but
next
day
the
storm
continued
it
grew
colder
and
the
drifts
piled
up
all
day
at
night
the
ceased
but
the
frost
grew
harder
still
so
redruff
leading
the
family
to
a
above
a
deep
drift
dived
into
the
snow
and
the
others
did
the
same
then
into
the
holes
the
wind
blew
the
loose
snow
their
pure
white
and
thus
tucked
in
they
slept
in
comfort
for
the
snow
is
a
warm
wrap
and
the
air
passes
through
it
easily
enough
for
breathing
next
morning
each
partridge
found
a
solid
wall
of
ice
before
him
from
his
frozen
breath
but
easily
turned
to
one
side
and
rose
on
the
wing
at
redruff
morning
kreet
kwit
come
children
come
children
fly
this
was
the
first
night
for
them
in
a
though
it
was
an
old
story
to
redruff
and
next
night
they
merrily
dived
again
into
bed
and
the
north
wind
tucked
them
in
as
before
but
a
change
of
weather
was
brewing
the
night
wind
veered
to
the
east
a
fall
of
heavy
flakes
gave
place
to
sleet
and
that
to
silver
rain
the
whole
wide
world
was
sheathed
in
ice
and
when
the
grouse
awoke
to
quit
their
beds
they
found
themselves
sealed
in
with
a
great
cruel
sheet
of
edgeless
ice
the
deeper
snow
was
still
quite
soft
and
redruff
bored
his
way
to
the
top
but
there
the
hard
white
sheet
defied
his
strength
hammer
and
struggle
as
he
might
he
could
make
no
impression
and
only
bruised
his
wings
and
head
his
life
had
been
made
up
of
keen
joys
and
dull
hardships
with
frequent
sudden
desperate
straits
but
this
seemed
the
hardest
brunt
of
all
as
the
slow
hours
wore
on
and
found
him
weakening
with
his
struggles
but
no
nearer
to
freedom
he
could
hear
the
struggling
of
his
family
too
or
sometimes
heard
them
calling
to
him
for
help
with
their
plaintive
they
were
hidden
from
many
of
their
enemies
but
not
from
the
pangs
of
hunger
and
when
the
night
came
down
the
weary
prisoners
worn
out
with
hunger
and
useless
toil
grew
quiet
in
despair
at
first
they
had
been
afraid
the
fox
would
come
and
find
them
imprisoned
there
at
his
mercy
but
as
the
second
night
went
slowly
by
they
no
longer
cared
and
even
wished
he
would
come
and
break
the
crusted
snow
and
so
give
them
at
least
a
fighting
chance
for
life
but
when
the
fox
really
did
come
padding
over
the
frozen
drift
the
love
of
life
revived
and
they
crouched
in
utter
stillness
till
he
passed
the
second
day
was
one
of
driving
storm
the
north
wind
sent
his
hissing
and
careering
over
the
white
earth
tossing
and
curling
their
white
manes
and
kicking
up
more
snow
as
they
dashed
on
the
long
hard
grinding
of
the
granular
snow
seemed
to
be
thinning
the
for
though
far
from
dark
below
it
kept
on
growing
lighter
redruff
had
pecked
and
pecked
at
the
under
side
all
day
till
his
head
ached
and
his
bill
was
wearing
blunt
but
when
the
sun
went
down
he
seemed
as
far
as
ever
from
escape
the
night
passed
like
the
others
except
no
fox
went
trotting
overhead
in
the
morning
he
renewed
his
pecking
though
now
with
scarcely
any
force
and
the
voices
or
struggles
of
the
others
were
no
more
heard
as
the
daylight
grew
stronger
he
could
see
that
his
long
efforts
had
made
a
brighter
spot
above
him
in
the
snow
and
he
continued
feebly
pecking
outside
the
kept
on
trampling
all
day
the
crust
was
really
growing
thin
under
their
heels
and
late
that
afternoon
his
bill
went
through
into
the
open
air
new
life
came
with
this
gain
and
he
pecked
away
till
just
before
the
sun
went
down
he
had
made
a
hole
that
his
head
his
neck
and
his
ruffs
could
pass
his
great
broad
shoulders
were
too
large
but
he
could
now
strike
downward
which
gave
him
fourfold
force
the
crumbled
quickly
and
in
a
little
while
he
sprang
from
his
icy
prison
once
more
free
but
the
young
ones
redruff
flew
to
the
nearest
bank
hastily
gathered
a
few
red
hips
to
stay
his
gnawing
hunger
then
returned
to
the
and
clucked
and
stamped
he
got
only
one
reply
a
feeble
peete
and
scratching
with
his
sharp
claws
on
the
thinned
granular
sheet
he
soon
broke
through
and
graytail
feebly
crawled
out
of
the
hole
but
that
was
all
the
others
scattered
he
could
not
tell
where
in
the
drift
made
no
reply
gave
no
sign
of
life
and
he
was
forced
to
leave
them
when
the
snow
melted
in
the
spring
their
bodies
came
to
view
skin
bones
and
feathers
nothing
more
vii
it
was
long
before
redruff
and
graytail
fully
recovered
but
food
and
rest
in
plenty
are
sure
and
a
bright
clear
day
in
midwinter
had
the
usual
effect
of
setting
the
vigorous
redruff
to
drumming
on
the
log
was
it
the
drumming
or
the
tracks
of
their
on
the
omnipresent
snow
that
betrayed
them
to
cuddy
he
came
prowling
again
and
again
up
the
ravine
with
dog
and
gun
intent
to
hunt
the
partridges
down
they
knew
him
of
old
and
he
was
coming
now
to
know
them
well
that
great
cock
was
becoming
famous
up
and
down
the
valley
during
the
gunner
moon
many
a
one
had
tried
to
end
his
splendid
life
just
as
a
worthless
wretch
of
old
sought
fame
by
burning
the
ephesian
wonder
of
the
world
but
redruff
was
deep
in
woodcraft
he
knew
just
where
to
hide
and
when
to
rise
on
silent
wing
and
when
to
squat
till
overstepped
then
rise
on
thunder
wing
within
a
yard
to
shield
himself
at
once
behind
some
mighty
and
speed
away
but
cuddy
never
ceased
to
follow
with
his
gun
that
cock
many
a
long
snapshot
he
tried
but
somehow
always
found
a
tree
a
bank
or
some
safe
shield
between
and
redruff
lived
and
throve
and
drummed
when
the
snow
moon
came
he
moved
with
graytail
to
the
castle
frank
woods
where
food
was
plenty
as
well
as
grand
old
trees
there
was
in
particular
on
the
east
slope
among
the
creeping
hemlocks
a
splendid
pine
it
was
six
feet
through
and
its
first
branches
began
at
the
tops
of
the
other
trees
its
top
in
was
a
famous
resort
for
the
bluejay
and
his
bride
here
far
beyond
the
reach
of
shot
in
warm
spring
days
the
jay
would
sing
and
dance
before
his
mate
spread
his
bright
blue
plumes
and
warble
the
sweetest
fairyland
music
so
sweet
and
soft
that
few
hear
it
but
the
one
for
whom
it
is
meant
and
books
know
nothing
at
all
about
it
this
great
pine
had
an
especial
interest
for
redruff
now
living
near
with
his
remaining
young
one
but
its
base
not
its
crown
concerned
him
all
around
were
low
creeping
hemlocks
and
among
them
the
and
the
wintergreen
grew
and
the
sweet
black
acorns
could
be
scratched
from
under
the
snow
there
was
no
better
for
when
that
insatiable
gunner
came
on
them
there
it
was
easy
to
run
low
among
the
hemlocks
to
the
great
pine
then
rise
with
a
derisive
whirr
behind
its
bulk
and
keeping
the
huge
trunk
in
line
with
the
deadly
gun
skim
off
in
safety
a
dozen
times
at
least
the
pine
had
saved
them
during
the
lawful
murder
season
and
here
it
was
that
cuddy
knowing
their
feeding
habits
laid
a
new
trap
under
the
bank
he
sneaked
and
watched
in
ambush
while
an
accomplice
went
around
the
sugar
loaf
to
drive
the
birds
he
came
trampling
through
the
low
thicket
where
redruff
and
graytail
were
feeding
and
long
before
the
gunner
was
dangerously
near
redruff
gave
a
low
warning
danger
and
walked
quickly
toward
the
great
pine
in
case
they
had
to
rise
graytail
was
some
distance
up
the
hill
and
suddenly
caught
sight
of
a
new
foe
close
at
hand
the
yellow
cur
coming
right
on
redruff
much
farther
off
could
not
see
him
for
the
bushes
and
graytail
became
greatly
alarmed
kwit
fly
fly
she
cried
running
down
the
hill
for
a
start
this
way
hide
cried
the
cooler
redruff
for
he
saw
that
now
the
man
with
the
gun
was
getting
in
range
he
gained
the
great
trunk
and
behind
it
as
he
paused
a
moment
to
call
earnestly
to
graytail
way
this
way
he
heard
a
slight
noise
under
the
bank
before
him
that
betrayed
the
ambush
then
there
was
a
terrified
cry
from
graytail
as
the
dog
sprang
at
her
she
rose
in
air
and
skimmed
behind
the
shielding
trunk
away
from
the
gunner
in
the
open
right
into
the
power
of
the
miserable
wretch
under
the
bank
whirr
and
up
she
went
a
beautiful
sentient
noble
being
bang
and
down
she
fell
battered
and
bleeding
to
gasp
her
life
out
and
to
lie
mere
carrion
in
the
snow
it
was
a
perilous
place
for
redruff
there
was
no
chance
for
a
safe
rise
so
he
squatted
low
the
dog
came
within
ten
feet
of
him
and
the
stranger
coming
across
to
cuddy
passed
at
five
feet
but
he
never
moved
till
a
chance
came
to
slip
behind
the
great
trunk
away
from
both
then
he
safely
rose
and
flew
to
the
lonely
glen
by
taylor
hill
one
by
one
the
deadly
cruel
gun
had
stricken
his
near
ones
down
till
now
once
more
he
was
alone
the
snow
moon
slowly
passed
with
many
a
narrow
escape
and
redruff
now
known
to
be
the
only
survivor
of
his
kind
was
relentlessly
pursued
and
grew
wilder
every
day
it
seemed
at
length
a
waste
of
time
to
follow
him
with
a
gun
so
when
the
snow
was
deepest
and
food
scarcest
cuddy
hatched
a
new
plot
right
across
the
almost
the
only
good
one
now
in
the
stormy
moon
he
set
a
row
of
snares
a
cottontail
rabbit
an
old
friend
cut
several
of
these
with
his
sharp
teeth
but
some
remained
and
redruff
watching
a
speck
that
might
turn
out
a
hawk
trod
right
in
one
of
them
and
in
an
instant
was
jerked
into
the
air
to
dangle
by
one
foot
have
the
wild
things
no
moral
or
legal
rights
what
right
has
man
to
inflict
such
long
and
fearful
agony
on
a
simply
because
that
creature
does
not
speak
his
language
all
that
day
with
growing
racking
pains
poor
redruff
hung
and
beat
his
great
strong
wings
in
helpless
struggles
to
be
free
all
day
all
night
with
growing
torture
until
he
only
longed
for
death
but
no
one
came
the
morning
broke
the
day
wore
on
and
still
he
hung
there
slowly
dying
his
very
strength
a
curse
the
second
night
crawled
slowly
down
and
when
in
the
dawdling
hours
of
darkness
a
great
horned
owl
drawn
by
the
feeble
flutter
of
a
dying
wing
cut
short
the
pain
the
deed
was
wholly
kind
the
wind
blew
down
the
valley
from
the
north
the
went
racing
over
the
wrinkled
ice
over
the
don
flats
and
over
the
marsh
toward
the
lake
white
for
they
were
driven
snow
but
on
them
scattered
dark
were
riding
plumy
fragments
of
partridge
ruffs
the
famous
rainbow
ruffs
and
they
rode
on
the
winter
wind
that
night
away
and
away
to
the
south
over
the
dark
and
boisterous
lake
as
they
rode
in
the
gloom
of
his
mad
moon
flight
riding
and
riding
on
till
they
were
engulfed
the
last
trace
of
the
last
of
the
don
valley
race
for
now
no
partridge
comes
to
castle
frank
its
miss
the
martial
spring
salute
and
in
mud
creek
ravine
the
old
pine
drumlog
since
unused
has
rotted
in
silence
away
