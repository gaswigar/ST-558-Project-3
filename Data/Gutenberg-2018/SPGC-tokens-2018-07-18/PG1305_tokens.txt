the

de

head
of
one
of

families
in

had
served
the
bourbon
cause
with
intelligence
and
bravery
during
the
war
in
la

against
the
republic
after
having
escaped
all
the
dangers
which
threatened
the
royalist
leaders
during
this
stormy
period
of
modern
history
he
was
wont
to
say
in
jest
i
am
one
of
the
men
who
gave
themselves
to
be
killed
on
the
steps
of
the
and
the
pleasantry
had
some
truth
in
it
as
spoken
by
a
man
left
for
dead
at
the
bloody
battle
of
les
quatre
chemins
though
ruined
by
confiscation
the
staunch
vendeen
steadily
refused
the
lucrative
posts
offered
to
him
by
the
emperor
napoleon
immovable
in
his
aristocratic
faith
he
had
blindly
obeyed
its
precepts
when
he
thought
it
fitting
to
choose
a
companion
for
life
in
spite
of
the
blandishments
of
a
rich
but
revolutionary
parvenu
who
valued
the
alliance
at
a
high
figure
he
married
mademoiselle
de
kergarouet
without
a
fortune
but
belonging
to
one
of
the
oldest
families
in
brittany
when
the
second
revolution
burst
on
monsieur
de
fontaine
he
was
encumbered
with
a
large
family
though
it
was
no
part
of
the
noble
gentlemen
s
views
to
solicit
favors
he
yielded
to
his
wife
s
wish
left
his
country
estate
of
which
the
income
barely
sufficed
to
maintain
his
children
and
came
to
paris
saddened
by
seeing
the
greediness
of
his
former
comrades
in
the
rush
for
places
and
dignities
under
the
new
constitution
he
was
about
to
return
to
his
property
when
he
received
a
ministerial
despatch
in
which
a
magnate
announced
to
him
his
nomination
as
marechal
de
camp
or
under
a
rule
which
allowed
the
officers
of
the
catholic
armies
to
count
the
twenty
submerged
years
of
louis
s
reign
as
years
of
service
some
days
later
he
further
received
without
any
solicitation
ex
officio
the
crosses
of
the
legion
of
honor
and
of
shaken
in
his
determination
by
these
successive
favors
due
as
he
supposed
to
the
monarch
s
remembrance
he
was
no
longer
satisfied
with
taking
his
family
as
he
had
piously
done
every
sunday
to
cry
vive
le
roi
in
the
hall
of
the
tuileries
when
the
royal
family
passed
through
on
their
way
to
chapel
he
craved
the
favor
of
a
private
audience
the
audience
at
once
granted
was
in
no
sense
private
the
royal
was
full
of
old
adherents
whose
powdered
heads
seen
from
above
suggested
a
carpet
of
snow
there
the
count
met
some
old
friends
who
received
him
somewhat
coldly
but
the
princes
he
thought
adorable
an
enthusiastic
expression
which
escaped
him
when
the
most
gracious
of
his
masters
to
whom
the
count
had
supposed
himself
to
be
known
only
by
name
came
to
shake
hands
with
him
and
spoke
of
him
as
the
most
thorough
vendeen
of
them
all
notwithstanding
this
ovation
none
of
these
august
persons
thought
of
inquiring
as
to
the
sum
of
his
losses
or
of
the
money
he
had
poured
so
generously
into
the
chests
of
the
catholic
regiments
he
discovered
a
little
late
that
he
had
made
war
at
his
own
cost
towards
the
end
of
the
evening
he
thought
he
might
venture
on
a
witty
allusion
to
the
state
of
his
affairs
similar
as
it
was
to
that
of
many
other
gentlemen
his
majesty
laughed
heartily
enough
any
speech
that
bore
the
of
wit
was
certain
to
please
him
but
he
nevertheless
replied
with
one
of
those
royal
pleasantries
whose
sweetness
is
more
formidable
than
the
anger
of
a
rebuke
one
of
the
king
s
most
intimate
advisers
took
an
opportunity
of
going
up
to
the
vendeen
and
made
him
understand
by
a
keen
and
polite
hint
that
the
time
had
not
yet
come
for
settling
accounts
with
the
sovereign
that
there
were
bills
of
much
longer
standing
than
his
on
the
books
and
there
no
doubt
they
would
remain
as
part
of
the
history
of
the
revolution
the
count
prudently
withdrew
from
the
venerable
group
which
formed
a
respectful
before
the
august
family
then
having
extricated
his
sword
not
without
some
difficulty
from
among
the
lean
legs
which
had
got
mixed
up
with
it
he
crossed
the
courtyard
of
the
tuileries
and
got
into
the
hackney
cab
he
had
left
on
the
quay
with
the
restive
spirit
which
is
peculiar
to
the
nobility
of
the
old
school
in
whom
still
survives
the
memory
of
the
league
and
the
day
of
the
barricades
in
he
bewailed
himself
in
his
cab
loudly
enough
to
compromise
him
over
the
change
that
had
come
over
the
court
formerly
he
said
to
himself
every
one
could
speak
freely
to
the
king
of
his
own
little
affairs
the
nobles
could
ask
him
a
favor
or
for
money
when
it
suited
them
and
nowadays
one
can
not
recover
the
money
advanced
for
his
service
without
raising
a
scandal
by
heaven
the
cross
of
and
the
rank
of
will
not
make
good
the
three
hundred
thousand
livres
i
have
spent
out
and
out
on
the
royal
cause
i
must
speak
to
the
king
face
to
face
in
his
own
this
scene
cooled
monsieur
de
fontaine
s
ardor
all
the
more
effectually
because
his
requests
for
an
interview
were
never
answered
and
indeed
he
saw
the
upstarts
of
the
empire
obtaining
some
of
the
offices
reserved
under
the
old
monarchy
for
the
highest
families
all
is
lost
he
exclaimed
one
morning
the
king
has
certainly
never
been
other
than
a
revolutionary
but
for
monsieur
who
never
derogates
and
is
some
comfort
to
his
faithful
adherents
i
do
not
know
what
hands
the
crown
of
france
might
not
fall
into
if
things
are
to
go
on
like
this
their
cursed
constitutional
system
is
the
worst
possible
government
and
can
never
suit
france
louis
xviii
and
monsieur
beugnot
spoiled
everything
at
saint
the
count
in
despair
was
preparing
to
retire
to
his
estate
abandoning
with
dignity
all
claims
to
repayment
at
this
moment
the
events
of
the
march
gave
warning
of
a
fresh
storm
threatening
to
overwhelm
the
legitimate
monarch
and
his
defenders
monsieur
de
fontaine
like
one
of
those
generous
souls
who
do
not
dismiss
a
servant
in
a
torrent
of
rain
borrowed
on
his
lands
to
follow
the
routed
monarchy
without
knowing
whether
this
complicity
in
emigration
would
prove
more
propitious
to
him
than
his
past
devotion
but
when
he
perceived
that
the
companions
of
the
king
s
exile
were
in
higher
favor
than
the
brave
men
who
had
protested
sword
in
hand
against
the
establishment
of
the
republic
he
may
perhaps
have
hoped
to
derive
greater
profit
from
this
journey
into
a
foreign
land
than
from
active
and
dangerous
service
in
the
heart
of
his
own
country
nor
was
his
calculation
one
of
these
rash
speculations
which
promise
splendid
results
on
paper
and
are
ruinous
in
effect
he
was
to
quote
the
wittiest
and
most
successful
of
our
diplomates
one
of
the
faithful
five
hundred
who
shared
the
exile
of
the
court
at
ghent
and
one
of
the
fifty
thousand
who
returned
with
it
during
the
short
banishment
of
royalty
monsieur
de
fontaine
was
so
happy
as
to
be
employed
by
louis
and
found
more
than
one
opportunity
of
giving
him
proofs
of
great
political
honesty
and
sincere
attachment
one
evening
when
the
king
had
nothing
better
to
do
he
recalled
monsieur
de
fontaine
s
witticism
at
the
tuileries
the
old
vendeen
did
not
let
such
a
happy
chance
slip
he
told
his
history
with
so
much
vivacity
that
a
king
who
never
forgot
anything
might
remember
it
at
a
convenient
season
the
royal
amateur
of
literature
also
observed
the
elegant
style
given
to
some
notes
which
the
discreet
gentleman
had
been
invited
to
recast
this
little
success
stamped
monsieur
de
fontaine
on
the
king
s
memory
as
one
of
the
loyal
servants
of
the
crown
at
the
second
restoration
the
count
was
one
of
those
special
envoys
who
were
sent
throughout
the
departments
charged
with
absolute
jurisdiction
over
the
leaders
of
revolt
but
he
used
his
terrible
powers
with
moderation
as
soon
as
the
temporary
commission
was
ended
the
high
provost
found
a
seat
in
the
privy
council
became
a
deputy
spoke
little
listened
much
and
changed
his
opinions
very
considerably
certain
circumstances
unknown
to
historians
brought
him
into
such
intimate
relations
with
the
sovereign
that
one
day
as
he
came
in
the
shrewd
monarch
addressed
him
thus
my
friend
fontaine
i
shall
take
care
never
to
appoint
you
to
be
or
minister
neither
you
nor
i
as
employees
could
keep
our
place
on
account
of
our
opinions
representative
government
has
this
advantage
it
saves
us
the
trouble
we
used
to
have
of
dismissing
our
secretaries
of
state
our
council
is
a
perfect
whither
public
opinion
sometimes
sends
strange
travelers
however
we
can
always
find
a
place
for
our
faithful
this
ironical
speech
was
introductory
to
a
rescript
giving
monsieur
de
fontaine
an
appointment
as
administrator
in
the
office
of
crown
lands
as
a
consequence
of
the
intelligent
attention
with
which
he
listened
to
his
royal
friend
s
sarcasms
his
name
always
rose
to
his
majesty
s
lips
when
a
commission
was
to
be
appointed
of
which
the
members
were
to
receive
a
handsome
salary
he
had
the
good
sense
to
hold
his
tongue
about
the
favor
with
which
he
was
honored
and
knew
how
to
entertain
the
monarch
in
those
familiar
chats
in
which
louis
xviii
delighted
as
much
as
in
a
note
by
his
brilliant
manner
of
repeating
political
anecdotes
and
the
political
or
parliamentary
if
the
expression
may
pass
which
at
that
time
was
rife
it
is
well
known
that
he
was
immensely
amused
by
every
detail
of
his
gouvernementabilite
a
word
adopted
by
his
facetious
majesty
thanks
to
the
comte
de
fontaine
s
good
sense
wit
and
tact
every
member
of
his
numerous
family
however
young
ended
as
he
jestingly
told
his
sovereign
in
attaching
himself
like
a
silkworm
to
the
leaves
of
the
thus
by
the
king
s
intervention
his
eldest
son
found
a
high
and
fixed
position
as
a
lawyer
the
second
before
the
restoration
a
mere
captain
was
appointed
to
the
command
of
a
legion
on
the
return
from
ghent
then
thanks
to
the
confusion
of
when
the
regulations
were
evaded
he
passed
into
the
bodyguard
returned
to
a
line
regiment
and
found
himself
after
the
affair
of
the
trocadero
a
with
a
commission
in
the
guards
the
youngest
appointed
ere
long
became
a
legal
official
and
director
of
a
municipal
board
of
the
city
of
paris
where
he
was
safe
from
changes
in
legislature
these
bounties
bestowed
without
parade
and
as
secret
as
the
favor
enjoyed
by
the
count
fell
unperceived
though
the
father
and
his
three
sons
each
had
sinecures
enough
to
enjoy
an
income
in
salaries
almost
equal
to
that
of
a
chief
of
department
their
political
good
fortune
excited
no
envy
in
those
early
days
of
the
constitutional
system
few
persons
had
very
precise
ideas
of
the
peaceful
domain
of
the
civil
service
where
astute
favorites
managed
to
find
an
equivalent
for
the
demolished
abbeys
monsieur
le
comte
de
fontaine
who
till
lately
boasted
that
he
had
not
read
the
charter
and
displayed
such
indignation
at
the
greed
of
courtiers
had
before
long
proved
to
his
august
master
that
he
understood
as
well
as
the
king
himself
the
spirit
and
resources
of
the
representative
system
at
the
same
time
notwithstanding
the
established
careers
open
to
his
three
sons
and
the
pecuniary
advantages
derived
from
four
official
appointments
monsieur
de
fontaine
was
the
head
of
too
large
a
family
to
be
able
to
his
fortune
easily
and
rapidly
his
three
sons
were
rich
in
prospects
in
favor
and
in
talent
but
he
had
three
daughters
and
was
afraid
of
wearying
the
monarch
s
benevolence
it
occurred
to
him
to
mention
only
one
by
one
these
virgins
eager
to
light
their
torches
the
king
had
too
much
good
taste
to
leave
his
work
incomplete
the
marriage
of
the
eldest
with
a
planat
de
baudry
was
arranged
by
one
of
those
royal
speeches
which
cost
nothing
and
are
worth
millions
one
evening
when
the
sovereign
was
out
of
spirits
he
smiled
on
hearing
of
the
existence
of
another
demoiselle
de
fontaine
for
whom
he
found
a
husband
in
the
person
of
a
young
magistrate
of
inferior
birth
no
doubt
but
wealthy
and
whom
he
created
baron
when
the
year
after
the
vendeen
spoke
of
mademoiselle
emilie
de
fontaine
the
king
replied
in
his
thin
sharp
tones
amicus
plato
sed
magis
amica
then
a
few
days
later
he
treated
his
friend
fontaine
to
a
quatrain
harmless
enough
which
he
styled
an
epigram
in
which
he
made
fun
of
these
three
daughters
so
skilfully
introduced
under
the
form
of
a
trinity
nay
if
report
is
to
be
believed
the
monarch
had
found
the
point
of
the
jest
in
the
unity
of
the
three
divine
persons
if
your
majesty
would
only
condescend
to
turn
the
epigram
into
an
epithalamium
said
the
count
trying
to
turn
the
sally
to
good
account
though
i
see
the
rhyme
of
it
i
fail
to
see
the
reason
retorted
the
king
who
did
not
relish
any
pleasantry
however
mild
on
the
subject
of
his
poetry
from
that
day
his
intercourse
with
monsieur
de
fontaine
showed
less
amenity
kings
enjoy
contradicting
more
than
people
think
like
most
youngest
children
emilie
de
fontaine
was
a
benjamin
spoilt
by
almost
everybody
the
king
s
coolness
therefore
caused
the
count
all
the
more
regret
because
no
marriage
was
ever
so
difficult
to
arrange
as
that
of
this
darling
daughter
to
understand
all
the
obstacles
we
must
make
our
way
into
the
fine
residence
where
the
official
was
housed
at
the
expense
of
the
nation
emilie
had
spent
her
childhood
on
the
family
estate
enjoying
the
abundance
which
suffices
for
the
joys
of
early
youth
her
lightest
wishes
had
been
law
to
her
sisters
her
brothers
her
mother
and
even
her
father
all
her
relations
doted
on
her
having
come
to
years
of
discretion
just
when
her
family
was
loaded
with
the
favors
of
fortune
the
enchantment
of
life
continued
the
luxury
of
paris
seemed
to
her
just
as
natural
as
a
wealth
of
flowers
or
fruit
or
as
the
rural
plenty
which
had
been
the
joy
of
her
first
years
just
as
in
her
childhood
she
had
never
been
thwarted
in
the
satisfaction
of
her
playful
desires
so
now
at
fourteen
she
was
still
obeyed
when
she
rushed
into
the
whirl
of
fashion
thus
accustomed
by
degrees
to
the
enjoyment
of
money
elegance
of
dress
of
gilded
and
fine
carriages
became
as
necessary
to
her
as
the
compliments
of
flattery
sincere
or
false
and
the
festivities
and
vanities
of
court
life
like
most
spoiled
children
she
tyrannized
over
those
who
loved
her
and
kept
her
blandishments
for
those
who
were
indifferent
her
faults
grew
with
her
growth
and
her
parents
were
to
gather
the
bitter
fruits
of
this
disastrous
education
at
the
age
of
nineteen
emilie
de
fontaine
had
not
yet
been
pleased
to
make
a
choice
from
among
the
many
young
men
whom
her
father
s
politics
brought
to
his
entertainments
though
so
young
she
asserted
in
society
all
the
freedom
of
mind
that
a
married
woman
can
enjoy
her
beauty
was
so
remarkable
that
for
her
to
appear
in
a
room
was
to
be
its
queen
but
like
sovereigns
she
had
no
friends
though
she
was
everywhere
the
object
of
attentions
to
which
a
finer
nature
than
hers
might
perhaps
have
succumbed
not
a
man
not
even
an
old
man
had
it
in
him
to
contradict
the
opinions
of
a
young
girl
whose
lightest
look
could
rekindle
love
in
the
coldest
heart
she
had
been
educated
with
a
care
which
her
sisters
had
not
enjoyed
painted
pretty
well
spoke
italian
and
english
and
played
the
piano
brilliantly
her
voice
trained
by
the
best
masters
had
a
ring
in
it
which
made
her
singing
irresistibly
charming
clever
and
intimate
with
every
branch
of
literature
she
might
have
made
folks
believe
that
as
mascarille
says
people
of
quality
come
into
the
world
knowing
everything
she
could
argue
fluently
on
italian
or
flemish
painting
on
the
middle
ages
or
the
renaissance
pronounced
at
haphazard
on
books
new
or
old
and
could
expose
the
defects
of
a
work
with
a
cruelly
graceful
wit
the
simplest
thing
she
said
was
accepted
by
an
admiring
crowd
as
a
fetfah
of
the
sultan
by
the
turks
she
thus
dazzled
shallow
persons
as
to
deeper
minds
her
natural
tact
enabled
her
to
discern
them
and
for
them
she
put
forth
so
much
fascination
that
under
cover
of
her
charms
she
escaped
their
scrutiny
this
enchanting
veneer
covered
a
careless
heart
the
opinion
common
to
many
young
girls
that
no
one
else
dwelt
in
a
sphere
so
lofty
as
to
be
able
to
understand
the
merits
of
her
soul
and
a
pride
based
no
less
on
her
birth
than
on
her
beauty
in
the
absence
of
the
overwhelming
sentiment
which
sooner
or
later
works
havoc
in
a
woman
s
heart
she
spent
her
young
ardor
in
an
immoderate
love
of
distinctions
and
expressed
the
deepest
contempt
for
persons
of
inferior
birth
supremely
impertinent
to
all
nobility
she
made
every
effort
to
get
her
parents
recognized
as
equals
by
the
most
illustrious
families
of
the
quarter
these
sentiments
had
not
escaped
the
observing
eye
of
monsieur
de
fontaine
who
more
than
once
when
his
two
elder
girls
were
married
had
smarted
under
emilie
s
sarcasm
logical
readers
will
be
surprised
to
see
the
old
royalist
bestowing
his
eldest
daughter
on
a
possessed
indeed
of
some
old
hereditary
estates
but
whose
name
was
not
preceded
by
the
little
word
to
which
the
throne
owed
so
many
partisans
and
his
second
to
a
magistrate
too
lately
baronified
to
obscure
the
fact
that
his
father
had
sold
firewood
this
noteworthy
change
in
the
ideas
of
a
noble
on
the
verge
of
his
sixtieth
year
an
age
when
men
rarely
renounce
their
convictions
was
due
not
merely
to
his
unfortunate
residence
in
the
modern
babylon
where
sooner
or
later
country
folks
all
get
their
corners
rubbed
down
the
comte
de
fontaine
s
new
political
conscience
was
also
a
result
of
the
king
s
advice
and
friendship
the
philosophical
prince
had
taken
pleasure
in
converting
the
vendeen
to
the
ideas
required
by
the
advance
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
the
new
aspect
of
the
monarchy
louis
xviii
aimed
at
fusing
parties
as
napoleon
had
fused
things
and
men
the
legitimate
king
who
was
not
less
clever
perhaps
than
his
rival
acted
in
a
contrary
direction
the
last
head
of
the
house
of
bourbon
was
just
as
eager
to
satisfy
the
third
estate
and
the
creations
of
the
empire
by
curbing
the
clergy
as
the
first
of
the
napoleons
had
been
to
attract
the
grand
old
nobility
or
to
endow
the
church
the
privy
councillor
being
in
the
secret
of
these
royal
projects
had
insensibly
become
one
of
the
most
prudent
and
influential
leaders
of
that
moderate
party
which
most
desired
a
fusion
of
opinion
in
the
interests
of
the
nation
he
preached
the
expensive
doctrines
of
constitutional
government
and
lent
all
his
weight
to
encourage
the
political
which
enabled
his
master
to
rule
france
in
the
midst
of
storms
perhaps
monsieur
de
fontaine
hoped
that
one
of
the
sudden
gusts
of
legislation
whose
unexpected
efforts
then
startled
the
oldest
politicians
might
carry
him
up
to
the
rank
of
peer
one
of
his
most
rigid
principles
was
to
recognize
no
nobility
in
france
but
that
of
the
peerage
the
only
families
that
might
enjoy
any
privileges
a
nobility
bereft
of
privileges
he
would
say
is
a
tool
without
a
as
far
from
lafayette
s
party
as
he
was
from
la
bourdonnaye
s
he
ardently
engaged
in
the
task
of
general
reconciliation
which
was
to
result
in
a
new
era
and
splendid
fortunes
for
france
he
strove
to
convince
the
families
who
frequented
his
or
those
whom
he
visited
how
few
favorable
openings
would
henceforth
be
offered
by
a
civil
or
military
career
he
urged
mothers
to
give
their
boys
a
start
in
independent
and
industrial
professions
explaining
that
military
posts
and
high
government
appointments
must
at
last
pertain
in
a
quite
constitutional
order
to
the
younger
sons
of
members
of
the
peerage
according
to
him
the
people
had
conquered
a
sufficiently
large
share
in
practical
government
by
its
elective
assembly
its
appointments
to
and
those
of
the
exchequer
which
said
he
would
always
as
heretofore
be
the
natural
right
of
the
distinguished
men
of
the
third
estate
these
new
notions
of
the
head
of
the
fontaines
and
the
prudent
matches
for
his
eldest
girls
to
which
they
had
led
met
with
strong
resistance
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
the
comtesse
de
fontaine
remained
faithful
to
the
ancient
beliefs
which
no
woman
could
disown
who
through
her
mother
belonged
to
the
rohans
although
she
had
for
a
while
opposed
the
happiness
and
fortune
awaiting
her
two
eldest
girls
she
yielded
to
those
private
considerations
which
husband
and
wife
confide
to
each
other
when
their
heads
are
resting
on
the
same
pillow
monsieur
de
fontaine
calmly
pointed
out
to
his
wife
by
exact
arithmetic
that
their
residence
in
paris
the
necessity
for
entertaining
the
magnificence
of
the
house
which
made
up
to
them
now
for
the
privations
so
bravely
shared
in
la
vendee
and
the
expenses
of
their
sons
swallowed
up
the
chief
part
of
their
income
from
salaries
they
must
therefore
seize
as
a
boon
from
heaven
the
opportunities
which
offered
for
settling
their
girls
with
such
wealth
would
they
not
some
day
enjoy
sixty
eighty
a
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
such
advantageous
matches
were
not
to
be
met
with
every
day
for
girls
without
a
portion
again
it
was
time
that
they
should
begin
to
think
of
economizing
to
add
to
the
estate
of
fontaine
and
the
old
territorial
fortune
of
the
family
the
countess
yielded
to
such
cogent
arguments
as
every
mother
would
have
done
in
her
place
though
perhaps
with
a
better
grace
but
she
declared
that
emilie
at
any
rate
should
marry
in
such
a
way
as
to
satisfy
the
pride
she
had
unfortunately
contributed
to
foster
in
the
girl
s
young
soul
thus
events
which
ought
to
have
brought
joy
into
the
family
had
introduced
a
small
leaven
of
discord
the
and
the
young
lawyer
were
the
objects
of
a
ceremonious
formality
which
the
countess
and
emilie
contrived
to
create
this
etiquette
soon
found
even
ampler
opportunity
for
the
display
of
domestic
tyranny
for
de
fontaine
married
mademoiselle
mongenod
the
daughter
of
a
rich
banker
the
president
very
sensibly
found
a
wife
in
a
young
lady
whose
father
twice
or
thrice
a
millionaire
had
traded
in
salt
and
the
third
brother
faithful
to
his
plebeian
doctrines
married
mademoiselle
grossetete
the
only
daughter
of
the
at
bourges
the
three
and
the
two
found
the
high
sphere
of
political
bigwigs
and
the
of
the
faubourg
so
full
of
charm
and
of
personal
advantages
that
they
united
in
forming
a
little
court
round
the
overbearing
emilie
this
treaty
between
interest
and
pride
was
not
however
so
firmly
cemented
but
that
the
young
despot
was
not
unfrequently
the
cause
of
revolts
in
her
little
realm
scenes
which
the
highest
circles
would
not
have
disowned
kept
up
a
sarcastic
temper
among
all
the
members
of
this
powerful
family
and
this
without
seriously
diminishing
the
regard
they
professed
in
public
degenerated
sometimes
in
private
into
sentiments
far
from
charitable
thus
the
s
wife
having
become
a
baronne
thought
herself
quite
as
noble
as
a
kergarouet
and
imagined
that
her
good
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
gave
her
the
right
to
be
as
impertinent
as
her
emilie
whom
she
would
sometimes
wish
to
see
happily
married
as
she
announced
that
the
daughter
of
some
peer
of
france
had
married
monsieur
with
no
title
to
his
name
the
vicomtesse
de
fontaine
amused
herself
by
eclipsing
emilie
in
the
taste
and
magnificence
that
were
conspicuous
in
her
dress
her
furniture
and
her
carriages
the
satirical
spirit
in
which
her
brothers
and
sisters
sometimes
received
the
claims
avowed
by
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
roused
her
to
wrath
that
a
perfect
hailstorm
of
sharp
sayings
could
hardly
mitigate
so
when
the
head
of
the
family
felt
a
slight
chill
in
the
king
s
tacit
and
precarious
friendship
he
trembled
all
the
more
because
as
a
result
of
her
sisters
defiant
mockery
his
favorite
daughter
had
never
looked
so
high
in
the
midst
of
these
circumstances
and
at
a
moment
when
this
petty
domestic
warfare
had
become
serious
the
monarch
whose
favor
monsieur
de
fontaine
still
hoped
to
regain
was
attacked
by
the
malady
of
which
he
was
to
die
the
great
political
chief
who
knew
so
well
how
to
steer
his
bark
in
the
midst
of
tempests
soon
succumbed
certain
then
of
favors
to
come
the
comte
de
fontaine
made
every
effort
to
collect
the
elite
of
marrying
men
about
his
youngest
daughter
those
who
may
have
tried
to
solve
the
difficult
problem
of
settling
a
haughty
and
capricious
girl
will
understand
the
trouble
taken
by
the
unlucky
father
such
an
affair
carried
out
to
the
liking
of
his
beloved
child
would
worthily
crown
the
career
the
count
had
followed
for
these
ten
years
at
paris
from
the
way
in
which
his
family
claimed
salaries
under
every
department
it
might
be
compared
with
the
house
of
austria
which
by
intermarriage
threatens
to
pervade
europe
the
old
vendeen
was
not
to
be
discouraged
in
bringing
forward
suitors
so
much
had
he
his
daughter
s
happiness
at
heart
but
nothing
could
be
more
absurd
than
the
way
in
which
the
impertinent
young
thing
pronounced
her
verdicts
and
judged
the
merits
of
her
adorers
it
might
have
been
supposed
that
like
a
princess
in
the
arabian
nights
emilie
was
rich
enough
and
beautiful
enough
to
choose
from
among
all
the
princes
in
the
world
her
objections
were
each
more
preposterous
than
the
last
one
had
too
thick
knees
and
was
another
was
this
one
s
name
was
durand
that
one
limped
and
almost
all
were
too
fat
livelier
more
attractive
and
gayer
than
ever
after
dismissing
two
or
three
suitors
she
rushed
into
the
festivities
of
the
winter
season
and
to
balls
where
her
keen
eyes
criticised
the
celebrities
of
the
day
delighted
in
encouraging
proposals
which
she
invariably
rejected
nature
had
bestowed
on
her
all
the
advantages
needed
for
playing
the
part
of
celimene
tall
and
slight
emilie
de
fontaine
could
assume
a
dignified
or
a
frolicsome
mien
at
her
will
her
neck
was
rather
long
allowing
her
to
affect
beautiful
attitudes
of
scorn
and
impertinence
she
had
cultivated
a
large
variety
of
those
turns
of
the
head
and
feminine
gestures
which
emphasize
so
cruelly
or
so
happily
a
hint
of
a
smile
fine
black
hair
thick
and
eyebrows
lent
her
countenance
an
expression
of
pride
to
which
her
coquettish
instincts
and
her
mirror
had
taught
her
to
add
terror
by
a
stare
or
gentleness
by
the
softness
of
her
gaze
by
the
set
of
the
gracious
curve
of
her
lips
by
the
coldness
or
the
sweetness
of
her
smile
when
emilie
meant
to
conquer
a
heart
her
pure
voice
did
not
lack
melody
but
she
could
also
give
it
a
sort
of
curt
clearness
when
she
was
minded
to
paralyze
a
partner
s
indiscreet
tongue
her
colorless
face
and
alabaster
brow
were
like
the
limpid
surface
of
a
lake
which
by
turns
is
rippled
by
the
impulse
of
a
breeze
and
recovers
its
glad
serenity
when
the
air
is
still
more
than
one
young
man
a
victim
to
her
scorn
accused
her
of
acting
a
part
but
she
justified
herself
by
inspiring
her
detractors
with
the
desire
to
please
her
and
then
subjecting
them
to
all
her
most
contemptuous
caprice
among
the
young
girls
of
fashion
not
one
knew
better
than
she
how
to
assume
an
air
of
reserve
when
a
man
of
talent
was
introduced
to
her
or
how
to
display
the
insulting
politeness
which
treats
an
equal
as
an
inferior
and
to
pour
out
her
impertinence
on
all
who
tried
to
hold
their
heads
on
a
level
with
hers
wherever
she
went
she
seemed
to
be
accepting
homage
rather
than
compliments
and
even
in
a
princess
her
airs
and
manner
would
have
transformed
the
chair
on
which
she
sat
into
an
imperial
throne
monsieur
de
fontaine
discovered
too
late
how
utterly
the
education
of
the
daughter
he
loved
had
been
ruined
by
the
tender
devotion
of
the
whole
family
the
admiration
which
the
world
is
at
first
ready
to
bestow
on
a
young
girl
but
for
which
sooner
or
later
it
takes
its
revenge
had
added
to
emilie
s
pride
and
increased
her
universal
subservience
had
developed
in
her
the
selfishness
natural
to
spoilt
children
who
like
kings
make
a
plaything
of
everything
that
comes
to
hand
as
yet
the
graces
of
youth
and
the
charms
of
talent
hid
these
faults
from
every
eye
faults
all
the
more
odious
in
a
woman
since
she
can
only
please
by
and
unselfishness
but
nothing
escapes
the
eye
of
a
good
father
and
monsieur
de
fontaine
often
tried
to
explain
to
his
daughter
the
more
important
pages
of
the
mysterious
book
of
life
vain
effort
he
had
to
lament
his
daughter
s
capricious
indocility
and
ironical
shrewdness
too
often
to
persevere
in
a
task
so
difficult
as
that
of
correcting
an
nature
he
contented
himself
with
giving
her
from
time
to
time
some
gentle
and
kind
advice
but
he
had
the
sorrow
of
seeing
his
tenderest
words
slide
from
his
daughter
s
heart
as
if
it
were
of
marble
a
father
s
eyes
are
slow
to
be
unsealed
and
it
needed
more
than
one
experience
before
the
old
royalist
perceived
that
his
daughter
s
rare
caresses
were
bestowed
on
him
with
an
air
of
condescension
she
was
like
young
children
who
seem
to
say
to
their
mother
make
haste
to
kiss
me
that
i
may
go
to
in
short
emilie
vouchsafed
to
be
fond
of
her
parents
but
often
by
those
sudden
whims
which
seem
inexplicable
in
young
girls
she
kept
aloof
and
scarcely
ever
appeared
she
complained
of
having
to
share
her
father
s
and
mother
s
heart
with
too
many
people
she
was
jealous
of
every
one
even
of
her
brothers
and
sisters
then
after
creating
a
desert
about
her
the
strange
girl
accused
all
nature
of
her
unreal
solitude
and
her
wilful
griefs
strong
in
the
experience
of
her
twenty
years
she
blamed
fate
because
not
knowing
that
the
mainspring
of
happiness
is
in
ourselves
she
demanded
it
of
the
circumstances
of
life
she
would
have
fled
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
to
escape
a
marriage
such
as
those
of
her
two
sisters
and
nevertheless
her
heart
was
full
of
horrible
jealousy
at
seeing
them
married
rich
and
happy
in
short
she
sometimes
led
her
mother
who
was
as
much
a
victim
to
her
vagaries
as
monsieur
de
fontaine
to
suspect
that
she
had
a
touch
of
madness
but
such
aberrations
are
quite
inexplicable
nothing
is
commoner
than
this
unconfessed
pride
developed
in
the
heart
of
young
girls
belonging
to
families
high
in
the
social
scale
and
gifted
by
nature
with
great
beauty
they
are
almost
all
convinced
that
their
mothers
now
forty
or
fifty
years
of
age
can
neither
sympathize
with
their
young
souls
nor
conceive
of
their
imaginings
they
fancy
that
most
mothers
jealous
of
their
girls
want
to
dress
them
in
their
own
way
with
the
premeditated
purpose
of
eclipsing
them
or
robbing
them
of
admiration
hence
often
secret
tears
and
dumb
revolt
against
supposed
tyranny
in
the
midst
of
these
woes
which
become
very
real
though
built
on
an
imaginary
basis
they
have
also
a
mania
for
composing
a
scheme
of
life
while
casting
for
themselves
a
brilliant
horoscope
their
magic
consists
in
taking
their
dreams
for
reality
secretly
in
their
long
meditations
they
resolve
to
give
their
heart
and
hand
to
none
but
the
man
possessing
this
or
the
other
qualification
and
they
paint
in
fancy
a
model
to
which
whether
or
no
the
future
lover
must
correspond
after
some
little
experience
of
life
and
the
serious
reflections
that
come
with
years
by
dint
of
seeing
the
world
and
its
prosaic
round
by
dint
of
observing
unhappy
examples
the
brilliant
hues
of
their
ideal
are
extinguished
then
one
fine
day
in
the
course
of
events
they
are
quite
astonished
to
find
themselves
happy
without
the
nuptial
poetry
of
their
it
was
on
the
strength
of
that
poetry
that
mademoiselle
emilie
de
fontaine
in
her
slender
wisdom
had
drawn
up
a
programme
to
which
a
suitor
must
conform
to
be
excepted
hence
her
disdain
and
sarcasm
though
young
and
of
an
ancient
family
he
must
be
a
peer
of
france
said
she
to
herself
i
could
not
bear
not
to
see
my
on
the
panels
of
my
carriage
among
the
folds
of
azure
mantling
not
to
drive
like
the
princes
down
the
broad
walk
of
the
on
the
days
of
longchamps
in
holy
week
besides
my
father
says
that
it
will
someday
be
the
highest
dignity
in
france
he
must
be
a
soldier
but
i
reserve
the
right
of
making
him
retire
and
he
must
bear
an
order
that
the
sentries
may
present
arms
to
and
these
rare
qualifications
would
count
for
nothing
if
this
creature
of
fancy
had
not
the
most
amiable
temper
a
fine
figure
intelligence
and
above
all
if
he
were
not
slender
to
be
lean
a
personal
grace
which
is
but
fugitive
especially
under
a
representative
government
was
an
indispensable
condition
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
had
an
ideal
standard
which
was
to
be
the
model
a
young
man
who
at
the
first
glance
did
not
fulfil
the
requisite
conditions
did
not
even
get
a
second
look
good
heavens
see
how
fat
he
is
was
with
her
the
utmost
expression
of
contempt
to
hear
her
people
of
respectable
corpulence
were
incapable
of
sentiment
bad
husbands
and
unfit
for
civilized
society
though
it
is
esteemed
a
beauty
in
the
east
to
be
fat
seemed
to
her
a
misfortune
for
a
woman
but
in
a
man
it
was
a
crime
these
paradoxical
views
were
amusing
thanks
to
a
certain
liveliness
of
rhetoric
the
count
felt
nevertheless
that
his
daughter
s
affections
of
which
the
absurdity
would
be
evident
to
some
women
who
were
not
less
than
merciless
would
inevitably
become
a
subject
of
constant
ridicule
he
feared
lest
her
eccentric
notions
should
deviate
into
bad
style
he
trembled
to
think
that
the
pitiless
world
might
already
be
laughing
at
a
young
woman
who
remained
so
long
on
the
stage
without
arriving
at
any
conclusion
of
the
drama
she
was
playing
more
than
one
actor
in
it
disgusted
by
a
refusal
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
the
slightest
turn
of
to
take
his
revenge
the
indifferent
the
were
beginning
to
weary
of
it
admiration
is
always
exhausting
to
human
beings
the
old
vendeen
knew
better
than
any
one
that
if
there
is
an
art
in
choosing
the
right
moment
for
coming
forward
on
the
boards
of
the
world
on
those
of
the
court
in
a
or
on
the
stage
it
is
still
more
difficult
to
quit
them
in
the
nick
of
time
so
during
the
first
winter
after
the
accession
of
charles
he
redoubled
his
efforts
seconded
by
his
three
sons
and
his
to
assemble
in
the
rooms
of
his
official
residence
the
best
matches
which
paris
and
the
various
deputations
from
departments
could
offer
the
splendor
of
his
entertainments
the
luxury
of
his
and
his
dinners
fragrant
with
truffles
rivaled
the
famous
banquets
by
which
the
ministers
of
that
time
secured
the
vote
of
their
parliamentary
recruits
the
honorable
deputy
was
consequently
pointed
at
as
a
most
influential
corrupter
of
the
legislative
honesty
of
the
illustrious
chamber
that
was
dying
as
it
would
seem
of
indigestion
a
whimsical
result
his
efforts
to
get
his
daughter
married
secured
him
a
splendid
popularity
he
perhaps
found
some
covert
advantage
in
selling
his
truffles
twice
over
this
accusation
started
by
certain
mocking
liberals
who
made
up
by
their
flow
of
words
for
their
small
following
in
the
chamber
was
not
a
success
the
poitevin
gentleman
had
always
been
so
noble
and
so
honorable
that
he
was
not
once
the
object
of
those
epigrams
which
the
malicious
journalism
of
the
day
hurled
at
the
three
hundred
votes
of
the
centre
at
the
ministers
the
cooks
the
the
princely
amphitryons
and
the
official
supporters
of
the
villele
ministry
at
the
close
of
this
campaign
during
which
monsieur
de
fontaine
had
on
several
occasions
brought
out
all
his
forces
he
believed
that
this
time
the
procession
of
suitors
would
not
be
a
mere
dissolving
view
in
his
daughter
s
eyes
that
it
was
time
she
should
make
up
her
mind
he
felt
a
certain
inward
satisfaction
at
having
well
fulfilled
his
duty
as
a
father
and
having
left
no
stone
unturned
he
hoped
that
among
so
many
hearts
laid
at
emilie
s
feet
there
might
be
one
to
which
her
caprice
might
give
a
preference
incapable
of
repeating
such
an
effort
and
tired
too
of
his
daughter
s
conduct
one
morning
towards
the
end
of
lent
when
the
business
at
the
chamber
did
not
demand
his
vote
he
determined
to
ask
what
her
views
were
while
his
valet
was
artistically
decorating
his
bald
yellow
head
with
the
delta
of
powder
which
with
the
hanging
ailes
de
pigeon
completed
his
venerable
style
of
hairdressing
emilie
s
father
not
without
some
secret
misgivings
told
his
old
servant
to
go
and
desire
the
haughty
damsel
to
appear
in
the
presence
of
the
head
of
the
family
joseph
he
added
when
his
hair
was
dressed
take
away
that
towel
draw
back
the
curtains
put
those
chairs
square
shake
the
rug
and
lay
it
quite
straight
dust
now
air
the
room
a
little
by
opening
the
the
count
multiplied
his
orders
putting
joseph
out
of
breath
and
the
old
servant
understanding
his
master
s
intentions
aired
and
tidied
the
room
of
course
the
least
cared
for
of
any
in
the
house
and
succeeded
in
giving
a
look
of
harmony
to
the
files
of
bills
the
the
books
and
furniture
of
this
sanctum
where
the
interests
of
the
royal
demesnes
were
debated
over
when
joseph
had
reduced
this
chaos
to
some
sort
of
order
and
brought
to
the
front
such
things
as
might
be
most
pleasing
to
the
eye
as
if
it
were
a
shop
front
or
such
as
by
their
color
might
give
the
effect
of
a
kind
of
official
poetry
he
stood
for
a
minute
in
the
midst
of
the
labyrinth
of
papers
piled
in
some
places
even
on
the
floor
admired
his
handiwork
jerked
his
head
and
went
the
anxious
did
not
share
his
retainer
s
favorable
opinion
before
seating
himself
in
his
deep
chair
whose
rounded
back
screened
him
from
draughts
he
looked
round
him
doubtfully
examined
his
with
a
hostile
expression
shook
off
a
few
grains
of
snuff
carefully
wiped
his
nose
arranged
the
tongs
and
shovel
made
the
fire
pulled
up
the
heels
of
his
slippers
pulled
out
his
little
queue
of
hair
which
had
lodged
horizontally
between
the
collar
of
his
waistcoat
and
that
of
his
restoring
it
to
its
perpendicular
position
then
he
swept
up
the
ashes
of
the
hearth
which
bore
witness
to
a
persistent
catarrh
finally
the
old
man
did
not
settle
himself
till
he
had
once
more
looked
all
over
the
room
hoping
that
nothing
could
give
occasion
to
the
saucy
and
impertinent
remarks
with
which
his
daughter
was
apt
to
answer
his
good
advice
on
this
occasion
he
was
anxious
not
to
compromise
his
dignity
as
a
father
he
daintily
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
cleared
his
throat
two
or
three
times
as
if
he
were
about
to
demand
a
count
out
of
the
house
then
he
heard
his
daughter
s
light
step
and
she
came
in
humming
an
air
from
il
barbiere
papa
what
do
you
want
with
me
so
early
having
sung
these
words
as
though
they
were
the
refrain
of
the
melody
she
kissed
the
count
not
with
the
familiar
tenderness
which
makes
a
daughter
s
love
so
sweet
a
thing
but
with
the
light
carelessness
of
a
mistress
confident
of
pleasing
whatever
she
may
do
my
dear
child
said
monsieur
de
fontaine
gravely
i
sent
for
you
to
talk
to
you
very
seriously
about
your
future
prospects
you
are
at
this
moment
under
the
necessity
of
making
such
a
choice
of
a
husband
as
may
secure
your
durable
happiness
my
good
father
replied
emilie
assuming
her
most
coaxing
tone
of
voice
to
interrupt
him
it
strikes
me
that
the
armistice
on
which
we
agreed
as
to
my
suitors
is
not
yet
emilie
we
must
forbear
from
jesting
on
so
important
a
matter
for
some
time
past
the
efforts
of
those
who
most
truly
love
you
my
dear
child
have
been
concentrated
on
the
endeavor
to
settle
you
suitably
and
you
would
be
guilty
of
ingratitude
in
meeting
with
levity
those
proofs
of
kindness
which
i
am
not
alone
in
lavishing
on
as
she
heard
these
words
after
flashing
a
mischievously
inquisitive
look
at
the
furniture
of
her
father
s
study
the
young
girl
brought
forward
the
armchair
which
looked
as
if
it
had
been
least
used
by
petitioners
set
it
at
the
side
of
the
fireplace
so
as
to
sit
facing
her
father
and
settled
herself
in
so
solemn
an
attitude
that
it
was
impossible
not
to
read
in
it
a
mocking
intention
crossing
her
arms
over
the
dainty
trimmings
of
a
pelerine
a
la
neige
and
ruthlessly
crushing
its
endless
frills
of
white
tulle
after
a
laughing
side
glance
at
her
old
father
s
troubled
face
she
broke
silence
i
never
heard
you
say
my
dear
father
that
the
government
issued
its
instructions
in
its
however
and
she
smiled
that
does
not
matter
the
mob
are
probably
not
particular
now
what
are
your
proposals
for
legislation
and
your
official
introductions
i
shall
not
always
be
able
to
make
them
headstrong
girl
listen
emilie
it
is
my
intention
no
longer
to
compromise
my
reputation
which
is
part
of
my
children
s
fortune
by
recruiting
the
regiment
of
dancers
which
spring
after
spring
you
put
to
rout
you
have
already
been
the
cause
of
many
dangerous
misunderstandings
with
certain
families
i
hope
to
make
you
perceive
more
truly
the
difficulties
of
your
position
and
of
ours
you
are
my
dear
child
and
you
ought
to
have
been
married
nearly
three
years
since
your
brothers
and
your
two
sisters
are
richly
and
happily
provided
for
but
my
dear
the
expenses
occasioned
by
these
marriages
and
the
style
of
housekeeping
you
require
of
your
mother
have
made
such
inroads
on
our
income
that
i
can
hardly
promise
you
a
hundred
thousand
francs
as
a
marriage
portion
from
this
day
forth
i
shall
think
only
of
providing
for
your
mother
who
must
not
be
sacrificed
to
her
children
emilie
if
i
were
to
be
taken
from
my
family
madame
de
fontaine
could
not
be
left
at
anybody
s
mercy
and
ought
to
enjoy
the
affluence
which
i
have
given
her
too
late
as
the
reward
of
her
devotion
in
my
misfortunes
you
see
my
child
that
the
amount
of
your
fortune
bears
no
relation
to
your
notions
of
grandeur
even
that
would
be
such
a
sacrifice
as
i
have
not
hitherto
made
for
either
of
my
children
but
they
have
generously
agreed
not
to
expect
in
the
future
any
compensation
for
the
advantage
thus
given
to
a
too
favored
in
their
position
said
emilie
with
an
ironical
toss
of
her
head
my
dear
do
not
so
depreciate
those
who
love
you
only
the
poor
are
generous
as
a
rule
the
rich
have
always
excellent
reasons
for
not
handing
over
twenty
thousand
francs
to
a
relation
come
my
child
do
not
pout
let
us
talk
among
the
young
marrying
men
have
you
noticed
monsieur
de
manerville
oh
he
minces
his
words
he
says
zules
instead
of
jules
he
is
always
looking
at
his
feet
because
he
thinks
them
small
and
he
gazes
at
himself
in
the
glass
besides
he
is
fair
i
don
t
like
fair
well
then
monsieur
de
beaudenord
he
is
not
noble
he
is
ill
made
and
stout
he
is
dark
it
is
if
the
two
gentlemen
could
agree
to
combine
their
fortunes
and
the
first
would
give
his
name
and
his
figure
to
the
second
who
should
keep
his
dark
hair
then
perhaps
what
can
you
say
against
monsieur
de
rastignac
madame
de
nucingen
has
made
a
banker
of
him
she
said
with
meaning
and
our
cousin
the
vicomte
de
portenduere
a
mere
boy
who
dances
badly
besides
he
has
no
fortune
and
after
all
papa
none
of
these
people
have
titles
i
want
at
least
to
be
a
countess
like
my
have
you
seen
no
one
then
this
winter
no
what
then
do
you
want
the
son
of
a
peer
of
france
my
dear
girl
you
are
mad
said
monsieur
de
fontaine
rising
but
he
suddenly
lifted
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
seemed
to
find
a
fresh
fount
of
resignation
in
some
religious
thought
then
with
a
look
of
fatherly
pity
at
his
daughter
who
herself
was
moved
he
took
her
hand
pressed
it
and
said
with
deep
feeling
god
is
my
witness
poor
mistaken
child
i
have
conscientiously
discharged
my
duty
to
you
as
a
father
conscientiously
do
i
say
most
lovingly
my
emilie
yes
god
knows
this
winter
i
have
brought
before
you
more
than
one
good
man
whose
character
whose
habits
and
whose
temper
were
known
to
me
and
all
seemed
worthy
of
you
my
child
my
task
is
done
from
this
day
forth
you
are
the
arbiter
of
your
fate
and
i
consider
myself
both
happy
and
unhappy
at
finding
myself
relieved
of
the
heaviest
of
paternal
functions
i
know
not
whether
you
will
for
any
long
time
now
hear
a
voice
which
to
you
has
never
been
stern
but
remember
that
conjugal
happiness
does
not
rest
so
much
on
brilliant
qualities
and
ample
fortune
as
on
reciprocal
esteem
this
happiness
is
in
its
nature
modest
and
devoid
of
show
so
now
my
dear
my
consent
is
given
beforehand
whoever
the
may
be
whom
you
introduce
to
me
but
if
you
should
be
unhappy
remember
you
will
have
no
right
to
accuse
your
father
i
shall
not
refuse
to
take
proper
steps
and
help
you
only
your
choice
must
be
serious
and
final
i
will
never
twice
compromise
the
respect
due
to
my
white
the
affection
thus
expressed
by
her
father
the
solemn
tones
of
his
urgent
address
deeply
touched
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
but
she
concealed
her
emotion
seated
herself
on
her
father
s
knees
for
he
had
dropped
all
tremulous
into
his
chair
again
caressed
him
fondly
and
coaxed
him
so
engagingly
that
the
old
man
s
brow
cleared
as
soon
as
emilie
thought
that
her
father
had
got
over
his
painful
agitation
she
said
in
a
gentle
voice
i
have
to
thank
you
for
your
graceful
attention
my
dear
father
you
have
had
your
room
set
in
order
to
receive
your
beloved
daughter
you
did
not
perhaps
know
that
you
would
find
her
so
foolish
and
so
headstrong
but
papa
is
it
so
difficult
to
get
married
to
a
peer
of
france
you
declared
that
they
were
manufactured
by
dozens
at
least
you
will
not
refuse
to
advise
no
my
poor
child
no
and
more
than
once
i
may
have
occasion
to
cry
beware
remember
that
the
making
of
peers
is
so
recent
a
force
in
our
government
machinery
that
they
have
no
great
fortunes
those
who
are
rich
look
to
becoming
richer
the
wealthiest
member
of
our
peerage
has
not
half
the
income
of
the
least
rich
lord
in
the
english
upper
chamber
thus
all
the
french
peers
are
on
the
lookout
for
great
heiresses
for
their
sons
wherever
they
may
meet
with
them
the
necessity
in
which
they
find
themselves
of
marrying
for
money
will
certainly
exist
for
at
least
two
centuries
pending
such
a
fortunate
accident
as
you
long
for
and
this
fastidiousness
may
cost
you
the
best
years
of
your
life
your
attractions
might
work
a
miracle
for
men
often
marry
for
love
in
these
days
when
experience
lurks
behind
so
sweet
a
face
as
yours
it
may
achieve
wonders
in
the
first
place
have
you
not
the
gift
of
recognizing
virtue
in
the
greater
or
smaller
dimensions
of
a
man
s
body
this
is
no
small
matter
to
so
wise
a
young
person
as
you
are
i
need
not
enlarge
on
all
the
difficulties
of
the
enterprise
i
am
sure
that
you
would
never
attribute
good
sense
to
a
stranger
because
he
had
a
handsome
face
or
all
the
virtues
because
he
had
a
fine
figure
and
i
am
quite
of
your
mind
in
thinking
that
the
sons
of
peers
ought
to
have
an
air
peculiar
to
themselves
and
perfectly
distinctive
manners
though
nowadays
no
external
sign
stamps
a
man
of
rank
those
young
men
will
have
perhaps
to
you
the
indefinable
something
that
will
reveal
it
then
again
you
have
your
heart
well
in
hand
like
a
good
horseman
who
is
sure
his
steed
can
not
bolt
luck
be
with
you
my
dear
you
are
making
game
of
me
papa
well
i
assure
you
that
i
would
rather
die
in
mademoiselle
de
conde
s
convent
than
not
be
the
wife
of
a
peer
of
she
slipped
out
of
her
father
s
arms
and
proud
of
being
her
own
mistress
went
off
singing
the
air
of
cara
non
dubitare
in
the
matrimonio
as
it
happened
the
family
were
that
day
keeping
the
anniversary
of
a
family
fete
at
dessert
madame
planat
the
s
wife
spoke
with
some
enthusiasm
of
a
young
american
owning
an
immense
fortune
who
had
fallen
passionately
in
love
with
her
sister
and
made
through
her
the
most
splendid
proposals
a
banker
i
rather
think
observed
emilie
carelessly
i
do
not
like
money
but
emilie
replied
the
baron
de
villaine
the
husband
of
the
count
s
second
daughter
you
do
not
like
lawyers
either
so
that
if
you
refuse
men
of
wealth
who
have
not
titles
i
do
not
quite
see
in
what
class
you
are
to
choose
a
especially
emilie
with
your
standard
of
slimness
added
the
i
know
what
i
want
replied
the
young
lady
my
sister
wants
a
fine
name
a
fine
young
man
fine
prospects
and
a
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
said
the
baronne
de
fontaine
monsieur
de
marsay
for
i
know
my
dear
retorted
emilie
that
i
do
not
mean
to
make
such
a
foolish
marriage
as
some
i
have
seen
moreover
to
put
an
end
to
these
matrimonial
discussions
i
hereby
declare
that
i
shall
look
on
anyone
who
talks
to
me
of
marriage
as
a
foe
to
my
peace
of
an
uncle
of
emilie
s
a
whose
fortune
had
just
been
increased
by
twenty
thousand
francs
a
year
in
consequence
of
the
act
of
indemnity
and
a
man
of
seventy
feeling
himself
privileged
to
say
hard
things
to
his
on
whom
he
doted
in
order
to
mollify
the
bitter
tone
of
the
discussion
now
exclaimed
do
not
tease
my
poor
little
emilie
don
t
you
see
she
is
waiting
till
the
duc
de
bordeaux
comes
of
age
the
old
man
s
pleasantry
was
received
with
general
laughter
take
care
i
don
t
marry
you
old
fool
replied
the
young
girl
whose
last
words
were
happily
drowned
in
the
noise
my
dear
children
said
madame
de
fontaine
to
soften
this
saucy
retort
emilie
like
you
will
take
no
advice
but
her
mother
bless
me
i
shall
take
no
advice
but
my
own
in
a
matter
which
concerns
no
one
but
myself
said
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
very
distinctly
at
this
all
eyes
were
turned
to
the
head
of
the
family
every
one
seemed
anxious
as
to
what
he
would
do
to
assert
his
dignity
the
venerable
gentleman
enjoyed
much
consideration
not
only
in
the
world
happier
than
many
fathers
he
was
also
appreciated
by
his
family
all
its
members
having
a
just
esteem
for
the
solid
qualities
by
which
he
had
been
able
to
make
their
fortunes
hence
he
was
treated
with
the
deep
respect
which
is
shown
by
english
families
and
some
aristocratic
houses
on
the
continent
to
the
living
representatives
of
an
ancient
pedigree
deep
silence
had
fallen
and
the
guests
looked
alternately
from
the
spoilt
girl
s
proud
and
sulky
pout
to
the
severe
faces
of
monsieur
and
madame
de
fontaine
i
have
made
my
daughter
emilie
mistress
of
her
own
fate
was
the
reply
spoken
by
the
count
in
a
deep
voice
relations
and
guests
gazed
at
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
with
mingled
curiosity
and
pity
the
words
seemed
to
declare
that
fatherly
affection
was
weary
of
the
contest
with
a
character
that
the
whole
family
knew
to
be
incorrigible
the
muttered
and
the
brothers
glanced
at
their
wives
with
mocking
smiles
from
that
moment
every
one
ceased
to
take
any
interest
in
the
haughty
girl
s
prospects
of
marriage
her
old
uncle
was
the
only
person
who
as
an
old
sailor
ventured
to
stand
on
her
tack
and
take
her
broadsides
without
ever
troubling
himself
to
return
her
fire
when
the
fine
weather
was
settled
and
after
the
budget
was
voted
the
whole
family
a
perfect
example
of
the
parliamentary
families
on
the
northern
side
of
the
channel
who
have
a
footing
in
every
government
department
and
ten
votes
in
the
house
of
commons
flew
away
like
a
brood
of
young
birds
to
the
charming
neighborhoods
of
aulnay
antony
and
chatenay
the
wealthy
had
lately
purchased
in
this
part
of
the
world
a
for
his
wife
who
remained
in
paris
only
during
the
session
though
the
fair
emilie
despised
the
commonalty
her
feeling
was
not
carried
so
far
as
to
scorn
the
advantages
of
a
fortune
acquired
in
a
profession
so
she
accompanied
her
sister
to
the
sumptuous
villa
less
out
of
affection
for
the
members
of
her
family
who
were
visiting
there
than
because
fashion
has
ordained
that
every
woman
who
has
any
must
leave
paris
in
the
summer
the
green
seclusion
of
sceaux
answered
to
perfection
the
requirements
of
good
style
and
of
the
duties
of
an
official
position
as
it
is
extremely
doubtful
that
the
fame
of
the
bal
de
sceaux
should
ever
have
extended
beyond
the
borders
of
the
department
of
the
seine
it
will
be
necessary
to
give
some
account
of
this
weekly
festivity
which
at
that
time
was
important
enough
to
threaten
to
become
an
institution
the
environs
of
the
little
town
of
sceaux
enjoy
a
reputation
due
to
the
scenery
which
is
considered
enchanting
perhaps
it
is
quite
ordinary
and
owes
its
fame
only
to
the
stupidity
of
the
paris
townsfolk
who
emerging
from
the
stony
abyss
in
which
they
are
buried
would
find
something
to
admire
in
the
flats
of
la
beauce
however
as
the
poetic
shades
of
aulnay
the
hillsides
of
antony
and
the
valley
of
the
bieve
are
peopled
with
artists
who
have
traveled
far
by
foreigners
who
are
very
hard
to
please
and
by
a
great
many
pretty
women
not
devoid
of
taste
it
is
to
be
supposed
that
the
parisians
are
right
but
sceaux
possesses
another
attraction
not
less
powerful
to
the
parisian
in
the
midst
of
a
garden
whence
there
are
delightful
views
stands
a
large
rotunda
open
on
all
sides
with
a
light
spreading
roof
supported
on
elegant
pillars
this
rural
baldachino
shelters
a
the
most
landowners
of
the
neighborhood
rarely
fail
to
make
an
excursion
thither
once
or
twice
during
the
season
arriving
at
this
rustic
palace
of
terpsichore
either
in
dashing
parties
on
horseback
or
in
the
light
and
elegant
carriages
which
powder
the
philosophical
pedestrian
with
dust
the
hope
of
meeting
some
women
of
fashion
and
of
being
seen
by
them
and
the
hope
less
often
disappointed
of
seeing
young
peasant
girls
as
wily
as
judges
crowds
the
ballroom
at
sceaux
with
numerous
swarms
of
lawyers
clerks
of
the
disciples
of
aesculapius
and
other
youths
whose
complexions
are
kept
pale
and
moist
by
the
damp
atmosphere
of
paris
and
a
good
many
bourgeois
marriages
have
had
their
beginning
to
the
sound
of
the
band
occupying
the
centre
of
this
circular
ballroom
if
that
roof
could
speak
what
could
it
not
tell
this
interesting
medley
gave
the
sceaux
balls
at
that
time
a
spice
of
more
amusement
than
those
of
two
or
three
places
of
the
same
kind
near
paris
and
it
had
incontestable
advantages
in
its
rotunda
and
the
beauty
of
its
situation
and
its
gardens
emilie
was
the
first
to
express
a
wish
to
play
at
being
common
folk
at
this
gleeful
suburban
entertainment
and
promised
herself
immense
pleasure
in
mingling
with
the
crowd
everybody
wondered
at
her
desire
to
wander
through
such
a
mob
but
is
there
not
a
keen
pleasure
to
grand
people
in
an
incognito
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
amused
herself
with
imagining
all
these
figures
she
fancied
herself
leaving
the
memory
of
a
bewitching
glance
and
smile
stamped
on
more
than
one
shopkeeper
s
heart
laughed
beforehand
at
the
damsels
airs
and
sharpened
her
pencils
for
the
scenes
she
proposed
to
sketch
in
her
satirical
album
sunday
could
not
come
soon
enough
to
satisfy
her
impatience
the
party
from
the
villa
planat
set
out
on
foot
so
as
not
to
betray
the
rank
of
the
personages
who
were
about
to
honor
the
ball
with
their
presence
they
dined
early
and
the
month
of
may
humored
this
aristocratic
escapade
by
one
of
its
finest
evenings
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
was
quite
surprised
to
find
in
the
rotunda
some
quadrilles
made
up
of
persons
who
seemed
to
belong
to
the
upper
classes
here
and
there
indeed
were
some
young
men
who
look
as
though
they
must
have
saved
for
a
month
to
shine
for
a
day
and
she
perceived
several
couples
whose
too
hearty
glee
suggested
nothing
conjugal
still
she
could
only
glean
instead
of
gathering
a
harvest
she
was
amused
to
see
that
pleasure
in
a
cotton
dress
was
so
very
like
pleasure
robed
in
satin
and
that
the
girls
of
the
middle
class
danced
quite
as
well
as
ladies
nay
sometimes
better
most
of
the
women
were
simply
and
suitably
dressed
those
who
in
this
assembly
represented
the
ruling
power
that
is
to
say
the
kept
apart
with
wonderful
politeness
in
fact
mademoiselle
emilie
had
to
study
the
various
elements
that
composed
the
mixture
before
she
could
find
any
subject
for
pleasantry
but
she
had
not
time
to
give
herself
up
to
malicious
criticism
or
opportunity
for
hearing
many
of
the
startling
speeches
which
caricaturists
so
gladly
pick
up
the
haughty
young
lady
suddenly
found
a
flower
in
this
wide
field
the
metaphor
is
reasonable
whose
splendor
and
coloring
worked
on
her
imagination
with
all
the
fascination
of
novelty
it
often
happens
that
we
look
at
a
dress
a
hanging
a
blank
sheet
of
paper
with
so
little
heed
that
we
do
not
at
first
detect
a
stain
or
a
bright
spot
which
afterwards
strikes
the
eye
as
though
it
had
come
there
at
the
very
instant
when
we
see
it
and
by
a
sort
of
moral
phenomenon
somewhat
resembling
this
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
discovered
in
a
young
man
the
external
perfection
of
which
she
had
so
long
dreamed
seated
on
one
of
the
clumsy
chairs
which
marked
the
boundary
line
of
the
circular
floor
she
had
placed
herself
at
the
end
of
the
row
formed
by
the
family
party
so
as
to
be
able
to
stand
up
or
push
forward
as
her
fancy
moved
her
treating
the
living
pictures
and
groups
in
the
hall
as
if
she
were
in
a
picture
gallery
impertinently
turning
her
on
persons
not
two
yards
away
and
making
her
remarks
as
though
she
were
criticising
or
praising
a
study
of
a
head
a
painting
of
genre
her
eyes
after
wandering
over
the
vast
moving
picture
were
suddenly
caught
by
this
figure
which
seemed
to
have
been
placed
on
purpose
in
one
corner
of
the
canvas
and
in
the
best
light
like
a
person
out
of
all
proportion
with
the
rest
the
stranger
alone
and
absorbed
in
thought
leaned
lightly
against
one
of
the
columns
that
supported
the
roof
his
arms
were
folded
and
he
leaned
slightly
on
one
side
as
though
he
had
placed
himself
there
to
have
his
portrait
taken
by
a
painter
his
attitude
though
full
of
elegance
and
dignity
was
devoid
of
affectation
nothing
suggested
that
he
had
half
turned
his
head
and
bent
it
a
little
to
the
right
like
alexander
or
lord
byron
and
some
other
great
men
for
the
sole
purpose
of
attracting
attention
his
fixed
gaze
followed
a
girl
who
was
dancing
and
betrayed
some
strong
feeling
his
slender
easy
frame
recalled
the
noble
proportions
of
the
apollo
fine
black
hair
curled
naturally
over
a
high
forehead
at
a
glance
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
observed
that
his
linen
was
fine
his
gloves
fresh
and
evidently
bought
of
a
good
maker
and
his
feet
were
small
and
well
shod
in
boots
of
irish
kid
he
had
none
of
the
vulgar
trinkets
displayed
by
the
dandies
of
the
national
guard
or
the
lovelaces
of
the
a
black
ribbon
to
which
an
was
attached
hung
over
a
waistcoat
of
the
most
fashionable
cut
never
had
the
fastidious
emilie
seen
a
man
s
eyes
shaded
by
such
long
curled
lashes
melancholy
and
passion
were
expressed
in
this
face
and
the
complexion
was
of
a
manly
olive
hue
his
mouth
seemed
ready
to
smile
unbending
the
corners
of
eloquent
lips
but
this
far
from
hinting
at
gaiety
revealed
on
the
contrary
a
sort
of
pathetic
grace
there
was
too
much
promise
in
that
head
too
much
distinction
in
his
whole
person
to
allow
of
one
s
saying
what
a
handsome
man
or
what
a
fine
man
one
wanted
to
know
him
the
most
observer
on
seeing
this
stranger
could
not
have
helped
taking
him
for
a
clever
man
attracted
to
this
rural
festivity
by
some
powerful
motive
all
these
observations
cost
emilie
only
a
minute
s
attention
during
which
the
privileged
gentleman
under
her
severe
scrutiny
became
the
object
of
her
secret
admiration
she
did
not
say
to
herself
he
must
be
a
peer
of
france
but
oh
if
only
he
is
noble
and
he
surely
must
be
without
finishing
her
thought
she
suddenly
rose
and
followed
by
her
brother
the
general
she
made
her
way
towards
the
column
affecting
to
watch
the
merry
quadrille
but
by
a
stratagem
of
the
eye
familiar
to
women
she
lost
not
a
gesture
of
the
young
man
as
she
went
towards
him
the
stranger
politely
moved
to
make
way
for
the
newcomers
and
went
to
lean
against
another
pillar
emilie
as
much
nettled
by
his
politeness
as
she
might
have
been
by
an
impertinence
began
talking
to
her
brother
in
a
louder
voice
than
good
taste
enjoined
she
turned
and
tossed
her
head
gesticulated
eagerly
and
laughed
for
no
particular
reason
less
to
amuse
her
brother
than
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
imperturbable
stranger
none
of
her
little
arts
succeeded
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
then
followed
the
direction
in
which
his
eyes
were
fixed
and
discovered
the
cause
of
his
indifference
in
the
midst
of
the
quadrille
close
in
front
of
them
a
pale
girl
was
dancing
her
face
was
like
one
of
the
divinities
which
girodet
has
introduced
into
his
immense
composition
of
french
warriors
received
by
ossian
emilie
fancied
that
she
recognized
her
as
a
distinguished
milady
who
for
some
months
had
been
living
on
a
neighboring
estate
her
partner
was
a
lad
of
about
fifteen
with
red
hands
and
dressed
in
nankeen
trousers
a
blue
coat
and
white
shoes
which
showed
that
the
damsel
s
love
of
dancing
made
her
easy
to
please
in
the
matter
of
partners
her
movements
did
not
betray
her
apparent
delicacy
but
a
faint
flush
already
tinged
her
white
cheeks
and
her
complexion
was
gaining
color
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
went
nearer
to
be
able
to
examine
the
young
lady
at
the
moment
when
she
returned
to
her
place
while
the
side
couples
in
their
turn
danced
the
figure
but
the
stranger
went
up
to
the
pretty
dancer
and
leaning
over
said
in
a
gentle
but
commanding
tone
clara
my
child
do
not
dance
any
clara
made
a
little
pouting
face
bent
her
head
and
finally
smiled
when
the
dance
was
over
the
young
man
wrapped
her
in
a
cashmere
shawl
with
a
lover
s
care
and
seated
her
in
a
place
sheltered
from
the
wind
very
soon
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
seeing
them
rise
and
walk
round
the
place
as
if
preparing
to
leave
found
means
to
follow
them
under
pretence
of
admiring
the
views
from
the
garden
her
brother
lent
himself
with
malicious
to
the
divagations
of
her
rather
eccentric
wanderings
emilie
then
saw
the
attractive
couple
get
into
an
elegant
tilbury
by
which
stood
a
mounted
groom
in
livery
at
the
moment
when
from
his
high
seat
the
young
man
was
drawing
the
reins
even
she
caught
a
glance
from
his
eye
such
as
a
man
casts
aimlessly
at
the
crowd
and
then
she
enjoyed
the
feeble
satisfaction
of
seeing
him
turn
his
head
to
look
at
her
the
young
lady
did
the
same
was
it
from
jealousy
i
imagine
you
have
now
seen
enough
of
the
garden
said
her
brother
we
may
go
back
to
the
i
am
ready
said
she
do
you
think
the
girl
can
be
a
relation
of
lady
dudley
s
lady
dudley
may
have
some
male
relation
staying
with
her
said
the
baron
de
fontaine
but
a
young
girl
no
next
day
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
expressed
a
wish
to
take
a
ride
then
she
gradually
accustomed
her
old
uncle
and
her
brothers
to
escorting
her
in
very
early
rides
excellent
she
declared
for
her
health
she
had
a
particular
fancy
for
the
environs
of
the
hamlet
where
lady
dudley
was
living
notwithstanding
her
cavalry
manoeuvres
she
did
not
meet
the
stranger
so
soon
as
the
eager
search
she
pursued
might
have
allowed
her
to
hope
she
went
several
times
to
the
bal
de
sceaux
without
seeing
the
young
englishman
who
had
dropped
from
the
skies
to
pervade
and
beautify
her
dreams
though
nothing
spurs
on
a
young
girl
s
infant
passion
so
effectually
as
an
obstacle
there
was
a
time
when
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
was
on
the
point
of
giving
up
her
strange
and
secret
search
almost
despairing
of
the
success
of
an
enterprise
whose
singularity
may
give
some
idea
of
the
boldness
of
her
temper
in
point
of
fact
she
might
have
wandered
long
about
the
village
of
chatenay
without
meeting
her
unknown
the
fair
clara
since
that
was
the
name
emilie
had
overheard
was
not
english
and
the
stranger
who
escorted
her
did
not
dwell
among
the
flowery
and
fragrant
bowers
of
chatenay
one
evening
emilie
out
riding
with
her
uncle
who
during
the
fine
weather
had
gained
a
fairly
long
truce
from
the
gout
met
lady
dudley
the
distinguished
foreigner
had
with
her
in
her
open
carriage
monsieur
vandenesse
emilie
recognized
the
handsome
couple
and
her
suppositions
were
at
once
dissipated
like
a
dream
annoyed
as
any
woman
must
be
whose
expectations
are
frustrated
she
touched
up
her
horse
so
suddenly
that
her
uncle
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
following
her
she
had
set
off
at
such
a
pace
i
am
too
old
it
would
seem
to
understand
these
youthful
spirits
said
the
old
sailor
to
himself
as
he
put
his
horse
to
a
canter
or
perhaps
young
people
are
not
what
they
used
to
be
but
what
ails
my
niece
now
she
is
walking
at
a
like
a
gendarme
on
patrol
in
the
paris
streets
one
might
fancy
she
wanted
to
outflank
that
worthy
man
who
looks
to
me
like
an
author
dreaming
over
his
poetry
for
he
has
i
think
a
notebook
in
his
hand
my
word
i
am
a
great
simpleton
is
not
that
the
very
young
man
we
are
in
search
of
at
this
idea
the
old
admiral
moderated
his
horse
s
pace
so
as
to
follow
his
niece
without
making
any
noise
he
had
played
too
many
pranks
in
the
years
and
soon
after
a
time
of
our
history
when
gallantry
was
held
in
honor
not
to
guess
at
once
that
by
the
merest
chance
emilie
had
met
the
unknown
of
the
sceaux
gardens
in
spite
of
the
film
which
age
had
drawn
over
his
gray
eyes
the
comte
de
kergarouet
could
recognize
the
signs
of
extreme
agitation
in
his
niece
under
the
unmoved
expression
she
tried
to
give
to
her
features
the
girl
s
piercing
eyes
were
fixed
in
a
sort
of
dull
amazement
on
the
stranger
who
quietly
walked
on
in
front
of
her
ay
that
s
it
thought
the
sailor
she
is
following
him
as
a
pirate
follows
a
merchantman
then
when
she
has
lost
sight
of
him
she
will
be
in
despair
at
not
knowing
who
it
is
she
is
in
love
with
and
whether
he
is
a
marquis
or
a
shopkeeper
really
these
young
heads
need
an
old
fogy
like
me
always
by
their
side
he
unexpectedly
spurred
his
horse
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
his
niece
s
bolt
and
rode
so
hastily
between
her
and
the
young
man
on
foot
that
he
obliged
him
to
fall
back
on
to
the
grassy
bank
which
rose
from
the
roadside
then
abruptly
drawing
up
the
count
exclaimed
couldn
t
you
get
out
of
the
way
i
beg
your
pardon
monsieur
but
i
did
not
know
that
it
lay
with
me
to
apologize
to
you
because
you
almost
rode
me
there
enough
of
that
my
good
fellow
replied
the
sailor
harshly
in
a
sneering
tone
that
was
nothing
less
than
insulting
at
the
same
time
the
count
raised
his
as
if
to
strike
his
horse
and
touched
the
young
fellow
s
shoulder
saying
a
liberal
citizen
is
a
reasoner
every
reasoner
should
be
the
young
man
went
up
the
bankside
as
he
heard
the
sarcasm
then
he
crossed
his
arms
and
said
in
an
excited
tone
of
voice
i
can
not
suppose
monsieur
as
i
look
at
your
white
hairs
that
you
still
amuse
yourself
by
provoking
duels
white
hairs
cried
the
sailor
interrupting
him
you
lie
in
your
throat
they
are
only
a
quarrel
thus
begun
had
in
a
few
seconds
become
so
fierce
that
the
younger
man
forgot
the
moderation
he
had
tried
to
preserve
just
as
the
comte
de
kergarouet
saw
his
niece
coming
back
to
them
with
every
sign
of
the
greatest
uneasiness
he
told
his
antagonist
his
name
bidding
him
keep
silence
before
the
young
lady
entrusted
to
his
care
the
stranger
could
not
help
smiling
as
he
gave
a
visiting
card
to
the
old
man
desiring
him
to
observe
that
he
was
living
at
a
at
chevreuse
and
after
pointing
this
out
to
him
he
hurried
away
you
very
nearly
damaged
that
poor
young
my
dear
said
the
count
advancing
hastily
to
meet
emilie
do
you
not
know
how
to
hold
your
horse
in
and
there
you
leave
me
to
compromise
my
dignity
in
order
to
screen
your
folly
whereas
if
you
had
but
stopped
one
of
your
looks
or
one
of
your
pretty
speeches
one
of
those
you
can
make
so
prettily
when
you
are
not
pert
would
have
set
everything
right
even
if
you
had
broken
his
but
my
dear
uncle
it
was
your
horse
not
mine
that
caused
the
accident
i
really
think
you
can
no
longer
ride
you
are
not
so
good
a
horseman
as
you
were
last
but
instead
of
talking
nonsense
nonsense
by
gad
is
it
nothing
to
be
so
impertinent
to
your
uncle
ought
we
not
to
go
on
and
inquire
if
the
young
man
is
hurt
he
is
limping
uncle
only
look
no
he
is
running
i
rated
him
oh
yes
uncle
i
know
you
there
stop
said
the
count
pulling
emilie
s
horse
by
the
bridle
i
do
not
see
the
necessity
of
making
advances
to
some
shopkeeper
who
is
only
too
lucky
to
have
been
thrown
down
by
a
charming
young
lady
or
the
commander
of
la
why
do
you
think
he
is
anything
so
common
my
dear
uncle
he
seems
to
me
to
have
very
fine
every
one
has
manners
nowadays
my
no
uncle
not
every
one
has
the
air
and
style
which
come
of
the
habit
of
frequenting
and
i
am
ready
to
lay
a
bet
with
you
that
the
young
man
is
of
noble
you
had
not
long
to
study
no
but
it
is
not
the
first
time
i
have
seen
nor
is
it
the
first
time
you
have
looked
for
him
replied
the
admiral
with
a
laugh
emilie
colored
her
uncle
amused
himself
for
some
time
with
her
embarrassment
then
he
said
emilie
you
know
that
i
love
you
as
my
own
child
precisely
because
you
are
the
only
member
of
the
family
who
has
the
legitimate
pride
of
high
birth
devil
take
it
child
who
could
have
believed
that
sound
principles
would
become
so
rare
well
i
will
be
your
confidant
my
dear
child
i
see
that
his
young
gentleman
is
not
indifferent
to
you
hush
all
the
family
would
laugh
at
us
if
we
sailed
under
the
wrong
flag
you
know
what
that
means
we
two
will
keep
our
secret
and
i
promise
to
bring
him
straight
into
the
when
uncle
but
my
dear
uncle
i
am
not
committed
to
anything
nothing
whatever
and
you
may
bombard
him
set
fire
to
him
and
leave
him
to
founder
like
an
old
hulk
if
you
choose
he
won
t
be
the
first
i
fancy
you
are
kind
uncle
as
soon
as
the
count
got
home
he
put
on
his
glasses
quietly
took
the
card
out
of
his
pocket
and
read
maximilien
longueville
rue
de
make
yourself
happy
my
dear
niece
he
said
to
emilie
you
may
hook
him
with
any
easy
conscience
he
belongs
to
one
of
our
historical
families
and
if
he
is
not
a
peer
of
france
he
infallibly
will
how
do
you
know
so
much
that
is
my
then
do
you
know
his
name
the
old
man
bowed
his
gray
head
which
was
not
unlike
a
gnarled
with
a
few
leaves
fluttering
about
it
withered
by
autumnal
frosts
and
his
niece
immediately
began
to
try
the
power
of
her
coquettish
arts
long
familiar
with
the
secret
of
cajoling
the
old
man
she
lavished
on
him
the
most
childlike
caresses
the
tenderest
names
she
even
went
so
far
as
to
kiss
him
to
induce
him
to
divulge
so
important
a
secret
the
old
man
who
spent
his
life
in
playing
off
these
scenes
on
his
niece
often
paying
for
them
with
a
present
of
jewelry
or
by
giving
her
his
box
at
the
opera
this
time
amused
himself
with
her
entreaties
and
above
all
her
caresses
but
as
he
spun
out
this
pleasure
too
long
emilie
grew
angry
passed
from
coaxing
to
sarcasm
and
sulks
then
urged
by
curiosity
she
recovered
herself
the
diplomatic
admiral
extracted
a
solemn
promise
from
his
niece
that
she
would
for
the
future
be
gentler
less
noisy
and
less
wilful
that
she
would
spend
less
and
above
all
tell
him
everything
the
treaty
being
concluded
and
signed
by
a
kiss
impressed
on
emilie
s
white
brow
he
led
her
into
a
corner
of
the
room
drew
her
on
to
his
knee
held
the
card
under
the
thumbs
so
as
to
hide
it
and
then
uncovered
the
letters
one
by
one
spelling
the
name
of
longueville
but
he
firmly
refused
to
show
her
anything
more
this
incident
added
to
the
intensity
of
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
s
secret
sentiment
and
during
chief
part
of
the
night
she
evolved
the
most
brilliant
pictures
from
the
dreams
with
which
she
had
fed
her
hopes
at
last
thanks
to
chance
to
which
she
had
so
often
appealed
emilie
could
now
see
something
very
unlike
a
chimera
at
the
of
the
imaginary
wealth
with
which
she
gilded
her
married
life
ignorant
as
all
young
girls
are
of
the
perils
of
love
and
marriage
she
was
passionately
captivated
by
the
externals
of
marriage
and
love
is
not
this
as
much
as
to
say
that
her
feeling
had
birth
like
all
the
feelings
of
extreme
youth
sweet
but
cruel
mistakes
which
exert
a
fatal
influence
on
the
lives
of
young
girls
so
inexperienced
as
to
trust
their
own
judgment
to
take
care
of
their
future
happiness
next
morning
before
emilie
was
awake
her
uncle
had
hastened
to
chevreuse
on
recognizing
in
the
courtyard
of
an
elegant
little
villa
the
young
man
he
had
so
determinedly
insulted
the
day
before
he
went
up
to
him
with
the
pressing
politeness
of
men
of
the
old
court
why
my
dear
sir
who
could
have
guessed
that
i
should
have
a
brush
at
the
age
of
with
the
son
or
the
grandson
of
one
of
my
best
friends
i
am
a
monsieur
is
not
that
as
much
as
to
say
that
i
think
no
more
of
fighting
a
duel
than
of
smoking
a
cigar
why
in
my
time
no
two
young
men
could
be
intimate
till
they
had
seen
the
color
of
their
blood
but
sdeath
sir
last
evening
i
had
taken
a
drop
too
much
grog
on
board
and
i
ran
you
down
shake
hands
i
would
rather
take
a
hundred
rebuffs
from
a
longueville
than
cause
his
family
the
smallest
however
coldly
the
young
man
tried
to
behave
to
the
comte
de
kergarouet
he
could
not
resist
the
frank
cordiality
of
his
manner
and
presently
gave
him
his
hand
you
were
going
out
riding
said
the
count
do
not
let
me
detain
you
but
unless
you
have
other
plans
i
beg
you
will
come
to
dinner
at
the
villa
planat
my
nephew
the
comte
de
fontaine
is
a
man
it
is
essential
that
you
should
know
ah
ha
and
i
propose
to
make
up
to
you
for
my
clumsiness
by
introducing
you
to
five
of
the
prettiest
women
in
paris
so
so
young
man
your
brow
is
clearing
i
am
fond
of
young
people
and
i
like
to
see
them
happy
their
happiness
reminds
me
of
the
good
times
of
my
youth
when
adventures
were
not
lacking
any
more
than
duels
we
were
gay
dogs
then
nowadays
you
think
and
worry
over
everything
as
though
there
had
never
been
a
fifteenth
and
a
sixteenth
but
monsieur
are
we
not
in
the
right
the
sixteenth
century
only
gave
religious
liberty
to
europe
and
the
nineteenth
will
give
it
political
lib
oh
we
will
not
talk
politics
i
am
a
perfect
old
woman
ultra
you
see
but
i
do
not
hinder
young
men
from
being
revolutionary
so
long
as
they
leave
the
king
at
liberty
to
disperse
their
when
they
had
gone
a
little
way
and
the
count
and
his
companion
were
in
the
heart
of
the
woods
the
old
sailor
pointed
out
a
slender
young
birch
sapling
pulled
up
his
horse
took
out
one
of
his
pistols
and
the
bullet
was
lodged
in
the
heart
of
the
tree
fifteen
paces
away
you
see
my
dear
fellow
that
i
am
not
afraid
of
a
duel
he
said
with
comical
gravity
as
he
looked
at
monsieur
longueville
nor
am
i
replied
the
young
man
promptly
cocking
his
pistol
he
aimed
at
the
hole
made
by
the
comte
s
bullet
and
sent
his
own
close
to
it
that
is
what
i
call
a
man
cried
the
admiral
with
enthusiasm
during
this
ride
with
the
youth
whom
he
already
regarded
as
his
nephew
he
found
endless
opportunities
of
catechizing
him
on
all
the
trifles
of
which
a
perfect
knowledge
constituted
according
to
his
private
code
an
accomplished
gentleman
have
you
any
debts
he
at
last
asked
of
his
companion
after
many
other
inquiries
no
what
you
pay
for
all
you
have
punctually
otherwise
we
should
lose
our
credit
and
every
sort
of
but
at
least
you
have
more
than
one
mistress
ah
you
blush
comrade
well
manners
have
changed
all
these
notions
of
lawful
order
kantism
and
liberty
have
spoilt
the
young
men
you
have
no
guimard
now
no
duthe
no
creditors
and
you
know
nothing
of
heraldry
why
my
dear
young
friend
you
are
not
fully
fledged
the
man
who
does
not
sow
his
wild
oats
in
the
spring
sows
them
in
the
winter
if
i
have
but
eighty
thousand
francs
a
year
at
the
age
of
seventy
it
is
because
i
ran
through
the
capital
at
thirty
oh
with
my
wife
in
decency
and
honor
however
your
imperfections
will
not
interfere
with
my
introducing
you
at
the
pavillon
planat
remember
you
have
promised
to
come
and
i
shall
expect
what
an
odd
little
old
man
said
longueville
to
himself
he
is
so
jolly
and
hale
but
though
he
wishes
to
seem
a
good
fellow
i
will
not
trust
him
too
next
day
at
about
four
o
clock
when
the
house
party
were
dispersed
in
the
and
a
servant
announced
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
villa
planat
monsieur
de
on
hearing
the
name
of
the
old
admiral
s
protege
every
one
down
to
the
player
who
was
about
to
miss
his
stroke
rushed
in
as
much
to
study
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
s
countenance
as
to
judge
of
this
phoenix
of
men
who
had
earned
honorable
mention
to
the
detriment
of
so
many
rivals
a
simple
but
elegant
style
of
dress
an
air
of
perfect
ease
polite
manners
a
pleasant
voice
with
a
ring
in
it
which
found
a
response
in
the
hearer
s
won
the
of
the
family
for
monsieur
longueville
he
did
not
seem
unaccustomed
to
the
luxury
of
the
s
ostentatious
mansion
though
his
conversation
was
that
of
a
man
of
the
world
it
was
easy
to
discern
that
he
had
had
a
brilliant
education
and
that
his
knowledge
was
as
thorough
as
it
was
extensive
he
knew
so
well
the
right
thing
to
say
in
a
discussion
on
naval
architecture
trivial
it
is
true
started
by
the
old
admiral
that
one
of
the
ladies
remarked
that
he
must
have
passed
through
the
ecole
polytechnique
and
i
think
madame
he
replied
that
i
may
regard
it
as
an
honor
to
have
got
in
spite
of
urgent
pressing
he
refused
politely
but
firmly
to
be
kept
to
dinner
and
put
an
end
to
the
persistency
of
the
ladies
by
saying
that
he
was
the
hippocrates
of
his
young
sister
whose
delicate
health
required
great
care
monsieur
is
perhaps
a
medical
man
asked
one
of
emilie
s
with
ironical
meaning
monsieur
has
left
the
ecole
polytechnique
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
kindly
put
in
her
face
had
flushed
with
richer
color
as
she
learned
that
the
young
lady
of
the
ball
was
monsieur
longueville
s
sister
but
my
dear
he
may
be
a
doctor
and
yet
have
been
to
the
ecole
polytechnique
is
it
not
so
monsieur
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
it
madame
replied
the
young
man
every
eye
was
on
emilie
who
was
gazing
with
uneasy
curiosity
at
the
fascinating
stranger
she
breathed
more
freely
when
he
added
not
without
a
smile
i
have
not
the
honor
of
belonging
to
the
medical
profession
and
i
even
gave
up
going
into
the
engineers
in
order
to
preserve
my
and
you
did
well
said
the
count
but
how
can
you
regard
it
as
an
honor
to
be
a
doctor
added
the
breton
nobleman
ah
my
young
friend
such
a
man
as
you
monsieur
le
comte
i
respect
every
profession
that
has
a
useful
well
in
that
we
agree
you
respect
those
professions
i
imagine
as
a
young
man
respects
a
monsieur
longueville
made
his
visit
neither
too
long
nor
too
short
he
left
at
the
moment
when
he
saw
that
he
had
pleased
everybody
and
that
each
one
s
curiosity
about
him
had
been
roused
he
is
a
cunning
rascal
said
the
count
coming
into
the
after
seeing
him
to
the
door
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
who
had
been
in
the
secret
of
this
call
had
dressed
with
some
care
to
attract
the
young
man
s
eye
but
she
had
the
little
disappointment
of
finding
that
he
did
not
bestow
on
her
so
much
attention
as
she
thought
she
deserved
the
family
were
a
good
deal
surprised
at
the
silence
into
which
she
had
retired
emilie
generally
displayed
all
her
arts
for
the
benefit
of
newcomers
her
witty
prattle
and
the
inexhaustible
eloquence
of
her
eyes
and
attitudes
whether
it
was
that
the
young
man
s
pleasing
voice
and
attractive
manners
had
charmed
her
that
she
was
seriously
in
love
and
that
this
feeling
had
worked
a
change
in
her
her
demeanor
had
lost
all
its
affectations
being
simple
and
natural
she
must
no
doubt
have
seemed
more
beautiful
some
of
her
sisters
and
an
old
lady
a
friend
of
the
family
saw
in
this
behavior
a
refinement
of
art
they
supposed
that
emilie
judging
the
man
worthy
of
her
intended
to
delay
revealing
her
merits
so
as
to
dazzle
him
suddenly
when
she
found
that
she
pleased
him
every
member
of
the
family
was
curious
to
know
what
this
capricious
creature
thought
of
the
stranger
but
when
during
dinner
every
one
chose
to
endow
monsieur
longueville
with
some
fresh
quality
which
no
one
else
had
discovered
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
sat
for
some
time
in
silence
a
sarcastic
remark
of
her
uncle
s
suddenly
roused
her
from
her
apathy
she
said
somewhat
epigrammatically
that
such
heavenly
perfection
must
cover
some
great
defect
and
that
she
would
take
good
care
how
she
judged
so
gifted
a
man
at
first
sight
those
who
please
everybody
please
nobody
she
added
and
the
worst
of
all
faults
is
to
have
like
all
girls
who
are
in
love
emilie
cherished
the
hope
of
being
able
to
hide
her
feelings
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
by
putting
the
that
watched
on
the
wrong
tack
but
by
the
end
of
a
fortnight
there
was
not
a
member
of
the
large
family
party
who
was
not
in
this
little
domestic
secret
when
monsieur
longueville
called
for
the
third
time
emilie
believed
it
was
chiefly
for
her
sake
this
discovery
gave
her
such
intoxicating
pleasure
that
she
was
startled
as
she
reflected
on
it
there
was
something
in
it
very
painful
to
her
pride
accustomed
as
she
was
to
be
the
centre
of
her
world
she
was
obliged
to
recognize
a
force
that
attracted
her
outside
herself
she
tried
to
resist
but
she
could
not
chase
from
her
heart
the
fascinating
image
of
the
young
man
then
came
some
anxiety
two
of
monsieur
longueville
s
qualities
very
adverse
to
general
curiosity
and
especially
to
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
s
were
unexpected
modesty
and
discretion
he
never
spoke
of
himself
of
his
pursuits
or
of
his
family
the
hints
emilie
threw
out
in
conversation
and
the
traps
she
laid
to
extract
from
the
young
fellow
some
facts
concerning
himself
he
could
evade
with
the
adroitness
of
a
diplomatist
concealing
a
secret
if
she
talked
of
painting
he
responded
as
a
connoisseur
if
she
sat
down
to
play
he
showed
without
conceit
that
he
was
a
very
good
pianist
one
evening
he
delighted
all
the
party
by
joining
his
delightful
voice
to
emilie
s
in
one
of
cimarosa
s
charming
duets
but
when
they
tried
to
find
out
whether
he
were
a
professional
singer
he
baffled
them
so
pleasantly
that
he
did
not
afford
these
women
practised
as
they
were
in
the
art
of
reading
feelings
the
least
chance
of
discovering
to
what
social
sphere
he
belonged
however
boldly
the
old
uncle
cast
the
over
the
vessel
longueville
slipped
away
cleverly
so
as
to
preserve
the
charm
of
mystery
and
it
was
easy
to
him
to
remain
the
handsome
stranger
at
the
villa
because
curiosity
never
overstepped
the
bounds
of
good
breeding
emilie
distracted
by
this
reserve
hoped
to
get
more
out
of
the
sister
than
the
brother
in
the
form
of
confidences
aided
by
her
uncle
who
was
as
skilful
in
such
manoeuvres
as
in
handling
a
ship
she
endeavored
to
bring
upon
the
scene
the
hitherto
unseen
figure
of
mademoiselle
clara
longueville
the
family
party
at
the
villa
planat
soon
expressed
the
greatest
desire
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
so
amiable
a
young
lady
and
to
give
her
some
amusement
an
informal
dance
was
proposed
and
accepted
the
ladies
did
not
despair
of
making
a
young
girl
of
sixteen
talk
notwithstanding
the
little
clouds
piled
up
by
suspicion
and
created
by
curiosity
a
light
of
joy
shone
in
emilie
s
soul
for
she
found
life
delicious
when
thus
intimately
connected
with
another
than
herself
she
began
to
understand
the
relations
of
life
whether
it
is
that
happiness
makes
us
better
or
that
she
was
too
fully
occupied
to
torment
other
people
she
became
less
caustic
more
gentle
and
indulgent
this
change
in
her
temper
enchanted
and
amazed
her
family
perhaps
at
last
her
selfishness
was
being
transformed
to
love
it
was
a
deep
delight
to
her
to
look
for
the
arrival
of
her
bashful
and
unconfessed
adorer
though
they
had
not
uttered
a
word
of
passion
she
knew
that
she
was
loved
and
with
what
art
did
she
not
lead
the
stranger
to
unlock
the
stores
of
his
information
which
proved
to
be
varied
she
perceived
that
she
too
was
being
studied
and
that
made
her
endeavor
to
remedy
the
defects
her
education
had
encouraged
was
not
this
her
first
homage
to
love
and
a
bitter
reproach
to
herself
she
desired
to
please
and
she
was
enchanting
she
loved
and
she
was
idolized
her
family
knowing
that
her
pride
would
sufficiently
protect
her
gave
her
enough
freedom
to
enjoy
the
little
childish
delights
which
give
to
first
love
its
charm
and
its
violence
more
than
once
the
young
man
and
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
walked
in
the
avenues
of
the
garden
where
nature
was
dressed
like
a
woman
going
to
a
ball
more
than
once
they
had
those
conversations
aimless
and
meaningless
in
which
the
emptiest
phrases
are
those
which
cover
the
deepest
feelings
they
often
admired
together
the
setting
sun
and
its
gorgeous
coloring
they
gathered
daisies
to
pull
the
petals
off
and
sang
the
most
impassioned
duets
using
the
notes
set
down
by
pergolesi
or
rossini
as
faithful
interpreters
to
express
their
secrets
the
day
of
the
dance
came
clara
longueville
and
her
brother
whom
the
servants
persisted
in
honoring
with
the
noble
de
were
the
principle
guests
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
felt
pleasure
in
a
young
girl
s
triumph
she
lavished
on
clara
in
all
sincerity
the
gracious
petting
and
little
attentions
which
women
generally
give
each
other
only
to
excite
the
jealousy
of
men
emilie
had
indeed
an
object
in
view
she
wanted
to
discover
some
secrets
but
being
a
girl
mademoiselle
longueville
showed
even
more
than
her
brother
for
she
did
not
even
look
as
if
she
were
hiding
a
secret
and
kept
the
conversation
to
subjects
unconnected
with
personal
interests
while
at
the
same
time
she
gave
it
so
much
charm
that
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
was
almost
envious
and
called
her
the
though
emilie
had
intended
to
make
clara
talk
it
was
clara
in
fact
who
questioned
emilie
she
had
meant
to
judge
her
and
she
was
judged
by
her
she
was
constantly
provoked
to
find
that
she
had
betrayed
her
own
character
in
some
reply
which
clara
had
extracted
from
her
while
her
modest
and
candid
manner
prohibited
any
suspicion
of
perfidy
there
was
a
moment
when
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
seemed
sorry
for
an
sally
against
the
commonalty
to
which
clara
had
led
her
mademoiselle
said
the
sweet
child
i
have
heard
so
much
of
you
from
maximilien
that
i
had
the
keenest
desire
to
know
you
out
of
affection
for
him
but
is
not
a
wish
to
know
you
a
wish
to
love
you
my
dear
clara
i
feared
i
might
have
displeased
you
by
speaking
thus
of
people
who
are
not
of
noble
oh
be
quite
easy
that
sort
of
discussion
is
pointless
in
these
days
as
for
me
it
does
not
affect
me
i
am
beside
the
ambitious
as
the
answer
might
seem
it
filled
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
with
the
deepest
joy
for
like
all
infatuated
people
she
explained
it
as
oracles
are
explained
in
the
sense
that
harmonized
with
her
wishes
she
began
dancing
again
in
higher
spirits
than
ever
as
she
watched
longueville
whose
figure
and
grace
almost
surpassed
those
of
her
imaginary
ideal
she
felt
added
satisfaction
in
believing
him
to
be
well
born
her
black
eyes
sparkled
and
she
danced
with
all
the
pleasure
that
comes
of
dancing
in
the
presence
of
the
being
we
love
the
couple
had
never
understood
each
other
as
well
as
at
this
moment
more
than
once
they
felt
their
finger
tips
thrill
and
tremble
as
they
were
married
in
the
figures
of
the
dance
the
early
autumn
had
come
to
the
handsome
pair
in
the
midst
of
country
festivities
and
pleasures
they
had
abandoned
themselves
softly
to
the
tide
of
the
sweetest
sentiment
in
life
strengthening
it
by
a
thousand
little
incidents
which
any
one
can
imagine
for
love
is
in
some
respects
always
the
same
they
studied
each
other
through
it
all
as
much
as
lovers
can
well
well
a
flirtation
never
turned
so
quickly
into
a
love
match
said
the
old
uncle
who
kept
an
eye
on
the
two
young
people
as
a
naturalist
watches
an
insect
in
the
microscope
the
speech
alarmed
monsieur
and
madame
fontaine
the
old
vendeen
had
ceased
to
be
so
indifferent
to
his
daughter
s
prospects
as
he
had
promised
to
be
he
went
to
paris
to
seek
information
and
found
none
uneasy
at
this
mystery
and
not
yet
knowing
what
might
be
the
outcome
of
the
inquiry
which
he
had
begged
a
paris
friend
to
institute
with
reference
to
the
family
of
longueville
he
thought
it
his
duty
to
warn
his
daughter
to
behave
prudently
the
fatherly
admonition
was
received
with
mock
submission
spiced
with
irony
at
least
my
dear
emilie
if
you
love
him
do
not
own
it
to
my
dear
father
i
certainly
do
love
him
but
i
will
await
your
permission
before
i
tell
him
but
remember
emilie
you
know
nothing
of
his
family
or
his
i
may
be
ignorant
but
i
am
content
to
be
but
father
you
wished
to
see
me
married
you
left
me
at
liberty
to
make
my
choice
my
choice
is
irrevocably
made
what
more
is
needful
it
is
needful
to
ascertain
my
dear
whether
the
man
of
your
choice
is
the
son
of
a
peer
of
france
the
venerable
gentleman
retorted
sarcastically
emilie
was
silent
for
a
moment
she
presently
raised
her
head
looked
at
her
father
and
said
somewhat
anxiously
are
not
the
longuevilles
they
became
extinct
in
the
person
of
the
old
duc
de
who
perished
on
the
scaffold
in
he
was
the
last
representative
of
the
last
and
younger
but
papa
there
are
some
very
good
families
descended
from
bastards
the
history
of
france
swarms
with
princes
bearing
the
bar
sinister
on
their
your
ideas
are
much
changed
said
the
old
man
with
a
smile
the
following
day
was
the
last
that
the
fontaine
family
were
to
spend
at
the
pavillon
planat
emilie
greatly
disturbed
by
her
father
s
warning
awaited
with
extreme
impatience
the
hour
at
which
young
longueville
was
in
the
habit
of
coming
to
wring
some
explanation
from
him
she
went
out
after
dinner
and
walked
alone
across
the
shrubbery
towards
an
arbor
fit
for
lovers
where
she
knew
that
the
eager
youth
would
seek
her
and
as
she
hastened
thither
she
considered
of
the
best
way
to
discover
so
important
a
matter
without
compromising
herself
a
rather
difficult
thing
hitherto
no
direct
avowal
had
sanctioned
the
feelings
which
bound
her
to
this
stranger
like
maximilien
she
had
secretly
enjoyed
the
sweetness
of
first
love
but
both
were
equally
proud
and
each
feared
to
confess
that
love
maximilien
longueville
to
whom
clara
had
communicated
her
not
unfounded
suspicions
as
to
emilie
s
character
was
by
turns
carried
away
by
the
violence
of
a
young
man
s
passion
and
held
back
by
a
wish
to
know
and
test
the
woman
to
whom
he
would
be
entrusting
his
happiness
his
love
had
not
hindered
him
from
perceiving
in
emilie
the
prejudices
which
marred
her
young
nature
but
before
attempting
to
counteract
them
he
wished
to
be
sure
that
she
loved
him
for
he
would
no
sooner
risk
the
fate
of
his
love
than
of
his
life
he
had
therefore
persistently
kept
a
silence
to
which
his
looks
his
behavior
and
his
smallest
actions
gave
the
lie
on
her
side
the
natural
to
a
young
girl
augmented
in
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
by
the
monstrous
vanity
founded
on
her
birth
and
beauty
kept
her
from
meeting
the
declaration
which
her
growing
passion
sometimes
urged
her
to
invite
thus
the
lovers
had
instinctively
understood
the
situation
without
explaining
to
each
other
their
secret
motives
there
are
times
in
life
when
such
vagueness
pleases
youthful
minds
just
because
each
had
postponed
speaking
too
long
they
seemed
to
be
playing
a
cruel
game
of
suspense
he
was
trying
to
discover
whether
he
was
beloved
by
the
effort
any
confession
would
cost
his
haughty
mistress
she
every
minute
hoped
that
he
would
break
a
too
respectful
silence
emilie
seated
on
a
rustic
bench
was
reflecting
on
all
that
had
happened
in
these
three
months
full
of
enchantment
her
father
s
suspicions
were
the
last
that
could
appeal
to
her
she
even
disposed
of
them
at
once
by
two
or
three
of
those
reflections
natural
to
an
inexperienced
girl
which
to
her
seemed
conclusive
above
all
she
was
convinced
that
it
was
impossible
that
she
should
deceive
herself
all
the
summer
through
she
had
not
been
able
to
detect
in
maximilien
a
single
gesture
or
a
single
word
which
could
indicate
a
vulgar
origin
or
vulgar
occupations
nay
more
his
manner
of
discussing
things
revealed
a
man
devoted
to
the
highest
interests
of
the
nation
besides
she
reflected
an
office
clerk
a
banker
or
a
merchant
would
not
be
at
leisure
to
spend
a
whole
season
in
paying
his
addresses
to
me
in
the
midst
of
woods
and
fields
wasting
his
time
as
freely
as
a
nobleman
who
has
life
before
him
free
of
all
she
had
given
herself
up
to
meditations
far
more
interesting
to
her
than
these
preliminary
thoughts
when
a
slight
rustling
in
the
leaves
announced
to
her
than
maximilien
had
been
watching
her
for
a
minute
not
probably
without
admiration
do
you
know
that
it
is
very
wrong
to
take
a
young
girl
thus
unawares
she
asked
him
smiling
especially
when
they
are
busy
with
their
secrets
replied
maximilien
archly
why
should
i
not
have
my
secrets
you
certainly
have
then
you
really
were
thinking
of
your
secrets
he
went
on
laughing
no
i
was
thinking
of
yours
my
own
i
but
perhaps
my
secrets
are
yours
and
yours
mine
cried
the
young
man
softly
seizing
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
s
hand
and
drawing
it
through
his
arm
after
walking
a
few
steps
they
found
themselves
under
a
clump
of
trees
which
the
hues
of
the
sinking
sun
wrapped
in
a
haze
of
red
and
brown
this
touch
of
natural
magic
lent
a
certain
solemnity
to
the
moment
the
young
man
s
free
and
eager
action
and
above
all
the
throbbing
of
his
surging
heart
whose
hurried
beating
spoke
to
emilie
s
arm
stirred
her
to
an
emotion
that
was
all
the
more
disturbing
because
it
was
produced
by
the
simplest
and
most
innocent
circumstances
the
restraint
under
which
the
young
girls
of
the
upper
class
live
gives
incredible
force
to
any
explosion
of
feeling
and
to
meet
an
impassioned
lover
is
one
of
the
greatest
dangers
they
can
encounter
never
had
emilie
and
maximilien
allowed
their
eyes
to
say
so
much
that
they
dared
never
speak
carried
a
way
by
this
intoxication
they
easily
forgot
the
petty
stipulations
of
pride
and
the
cold
hesitancies
of
suspicion
at
first
indeed
they
could
only
express
themselves
by
a
pressure
of
hands
which
interpreted
their
happy
thoughts
after
slowing
pacing
a
few
steps
in
long
silence
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
spoke
monsieur
i
have
a
question
to
ask
you
she
said
trembling
and
in
an
agitated
voice
but
remember
i
beg
that
it
is
in
a
manner
compulsory
on
me
from
the
rather
singular
position
i
am
in
with
regard
to
my
a
pause
terrible
to
emilie
followed
these
sentences
which
she
had
almost
stammered
out
during
the
minute
while
it
lasted
the
girl
haughty
as
she
was
dared
not
meet
the
flashing
eye
of
the
man
she
loved
for
she
was
secretly
conscious
of
the
meanness
of
the
next
words
she
added
are
you
of
noble
birth
as
soon
as
the
words
were
spoken
she
wished
herself
at
the
bottom
of
a
lake
mademoiselle
longueville
gravely
replied
and
his
face
assumed
a
sort
of
stern
dignity
i
promise
to
answer
you
truly
as
soon
as
you
shall
have
answered
in
all
sincerity
a
question
i
will
put
to
you
he
released
her
arm
and
the
girl
suddenly
felt
alone
in
the
world
as
he
said
what
is
your
object
in
questioning
me
as
to
my
birth
she
stood
motionless
cold
and
speechless
mademoiselle
maximilien
went
on
let
us
go
no
further
if
we
do
not
understand
each
other
i
love
you
he
said
in
a
voice
of
deep
emotion
well
then
he
added
as
he
heard
the
joyful
exclamation
she
could
not
suppress
why
ask
me
if
i
am
of
noble
birth
could
he
speak
so
if
he
were
not
cried
a
voice
within
her
which
emilie
believed
came
from
the
depths
of
her
heart
she
gracefully
raised
her
head
seemed
to
find
new
life
in
the
young
man
s
gaze
and
held
out
her
hand
as
if
to
renew
the
alliance
you
thought
i
cared
very
much
for
dignities
said
she
with
keen
archness
i
have
no
titles
to
offer
my
wife
he
replied
in
a
tone
but
if
i
choose
one
of
high
rank
and
among
women
whom
a
wealthy
home
has
accustomed
to
the
luxury
and
pleasures
of
a
fine
fortune
i
know
what
such
a
choice
requires
of
me
love
gives
everything
he
added
lightly
but
only
to
lovers
once
married
they
need
something
more
than
the
vault
of
heaven
and
the
carpet
of
a
he
is
rich
she
reflected
as
to
titles
perhaps
he
only
wants
to
try
me
he
has
been
told
that
i
am
mad
about
titles
and
bent
on
marrying
none
but
a
peer
s
son
my
priggish
sisters
have
played
me
that
i
assure
you
monsieur
she
said
aloud
that
i
have
had
very
extravagant
ideas
about
life
and
the
world
but
now
she
added
pointedly
looking
at
him
in
a
perfectly
distracting
way
i
know
where
true
riches
are
to
be
found
for
a
i
must
believe
that
you
are
speaking
from
the
depths
of
your
heart
he
said
with
gentle
gravity
but
this
winter
my
dear
emilie
in
less
than
two
months
perhaps
i
may
be
proud
of
what
i
shall
have
to
offer
you
if
you
care
for
the
pleasures
of
wealth
this
is
the
only
secret
i
shall
keep
locked
here
and
he
laid
his
hand
on
his
heart
for
on
its
success
my
happiness
depends
i
dare
not
say
yes
yes
ours
exchanging
such
sweet
nothings
they
slowly
made
their
way
back
to
rejoin
the
company
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
had
never
found
her
lover
more
amiable
or
wittier
his
light
figure
his
engaging
manners
seemed
to
her
more
charming
than
ever
since
the
conversation
which
had
made
her
to
some
extent
the
possessor
of
a
heart
worthy
to
be
the
envy
of
every
woman
they
sang
an
italian
duet
with
so
much
expression
that
the
audience
applauded
enthusiastically
their
adieux
were
in
a
conventional
tone
which
concealed
their
happiness
in
short
this
day
had
been
to
emilie
like
a
chain
binding
her
more
closely
than
ever
to
the
stranger
s
fate
the
strength
and
dignity
he
had
displayed
in
the
scene
when
they
had
confessed
their
feelings
had
perhaps
impressed
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
with
the
respect
without
which
there
is
no
true
love
when
she
was
left
alone
in
the
with
her
father
the
old
man
went
up
to
her
affectionately
held
her
hands
and
asked
her
whether
she
had
gained
any
light
at
to
monsieur
longueville
s
family
and
fortune
yes
my
dear
father
she
replied
and
i
am
happier
than
i
could
have
hoped
in
short
monsieur
de
longueville
is
the
only
man
i
could
ever
very
well
emilie
said
the
count
then
i
know
what
remains
for
me
to
do
you
know
of
any
impediment
she
asked
in
sincere
alarm
my
dear
child
the
young
man
is
totally
unknown
to
me
but
unless
he
is
not
a
man
of
honor
so
long
as
you
love
him
he
is
as
dear
to
me
as
a
not
a
man
of
honor
exclaimed
emilie
as
to
that
i
am
quite
easy
my
uncle
who
introduced
him
to
us
will
answer
for
him
say
my
dear
uncle
has
he
been
a
filibuster
an
outlaw
a
pirate
i
knew
i
should
find
myself
in
this
fix
cried
the
old
sailor
waking
up
he
looked
round
the
room
but
his
niece
had
vanished
like
s
fires
to
use
his
favorite
expression
well
uncle
monsieur
de
fontaine
went
on
how
could
you
hide
from
us
all
you
knew
about
this
young
man
you
must
have
seen
how
anxious
we
have
been
is
monsieur
de
longueville
a
man
of
family
i
don
t
know
him
from
adam
or
eve
said
the
comte
de
kergarouet
trusting
to
that
crazy
child
s
tact
i
got
him
here
by
a
method
of
my
own
i
know
that
the
boy
shoots
with
a
pistol
to
admiration
hunts
well
plays
wonderfully
at
billiards
at
chess
and
at
backgammon
he
handles
the
foils
and
rides
a
horse
like
the
late
chevalier
de
he
has
a
thorough
knowledge
of
all
our
vintages
he
is
as
good
an
arithmetician
as
bareme
draws
dances
and
sings
well
the
devil
s
in
it
what
more
do
you
want
if
that
is
not
a
perfect
gentleman
find
me
a
bourgeois
who
knows
all
this
or
any
man
who
lives
more
nobly
than
he
does
does
he
do
anything
i
ask
you
does
he
compromise
his
dignity
by
hanging
about
an
office
bowing
down
before
the
upstarts
you
call
he
walks
upright
he
is
a
however
i
have
just
found
in
my
waistcoat
pocket
the
card
he
gave
me
when
he
fancied
i
wanted
to
cut
his
throat
poor
innocent
young
men
are
very
nowadays
here
it
rue
du
sentier
no
said
monsieur
de
fontaine
trying
to
recall
among
all
the
information
he
had
received
something
which
might
concern
the
stranger
what
the
devil
can
it
mean
palma
werbrust
wholesale
dealers
in
muslins
calicoes
and
printed
cotton
goods
live
stay
i
have
it
longueville
the
deputy
has
an
interest
in
their
house
well
but
so
far
as
i
know
longueville
has
but
one
son
of
who
is
not
at
all
like
our
man
and
to
whom
he
gave
fifty
thousand
francs
a
year
that
he
might
marry
a
minister
s
daughter
he
wants
to
be
made
a
peer
like
the
rest
of
i
never
heard
him
mention
this
maximilien
has
he
a
daughter
what
is
this
girl
clara
besides
it
is
open
to
any
adventurer
to
call
himself
longueville
but
is
not
the
house
of
palma
werbrust
half
ruined
by
some
speculation
in
mexico
or
the
indies
i
will
clear
all
this
you
speak
a
soliloquy
as
if
you
were
on
the
stage
and
seem
to
account
me
a
cipher
said
the
old
admiral
suddenly
don
t
you
know
that
if
he
is
a
gentleman
i
have
more
than
one
bag
in
my
hold
that
will
stop
any
leak
in
his
fortune
as
to
that
if
he
is
a
son
of
longueville
s
he
will
want
nothing
but
said
monsieur
de
fontaine
shaking
his
head
from
side
to
side
his
father
has
not
even
washed
off
the
stains
of
his
origin
before
the
revolution
he
was
an
attorney
and
the
de
he
has
since
assumed
no
more
belongs
to
him
than
half
of
his
pooh
pooh
happy
those
whose
fathers
were
hanged
cried
the
admiral
gaily
three
or
four
days
after
this
memorable
day
on
one
of
those
fine
mornings
in
the
month
of
november
which
show
the
boulevards
cleaned
by
the
sharp
cold
of
an
early
frost
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
wrapped
in
a
new
style
of
fur
cape
of
which
she
wished
to
set
the
fashion
went
out
with
two
of
her
on
whom
she
had
been
wont
to
discharge
her
most
cutting
remarks
the
three
women
were
tempted
to
the
drive
less
by
their
desire
to
try
a
very
elegant
carriage
and
wear
gowns
which
were
to
set
the
fashion
for
the
winter
than
by
their
wish
to
see
a
cape
which
a
friend
had
observed
in
a
handsome
lace
and
linen
shop
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
la
paix
as
soon
as
they
were
in
the
shop
the
baronne
de
fontaine
pulled
emilie
by
the
sleeve
and
pointed
out
to
her
maximilien
longueville
seated
behind
the
desk
and
engaged
in
paying
out
the
change
for
a
gold
piece
to
one
of
the
workwomen
with
whom
he
seemed
to
be
in
consultation
the
handsome
stranger
held
in
his
hand
a
parcel
of
patterns
which
left
no
doubt
as
to
his
honorable
profession
emilie
felt
an
icy
shudder
though
no
one
perceived
it
thanks
to
the
good
breeding
of
the
best
society
she
completely
concealed
the
rage
in
her
heart
and
answered
her
with
the
words
i
knew
it
with
a
fulness
of
intonation
and
inimitable
decision
which
the
most
famous
actress
of
the
time
might
have
envied
her
she
went
straight
up
to
the
desk
longueville
looked
up
put
the
patterns
in
his
pocket
with
distracting
coolness
bowed
to
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
and
came
forward
looking
at
her
keenly
mademoiselle
he
said
to
the
shopgirl
who
followed
him
looking
very
much
disturbed
i
will
send
to
settle
that
account
my
house
deals
in
that
way
but
here
he
whispered
into
her
ear
as
he
gave
her
a
note
take
this
it
is
between
you
will
forgive
me
i
trust
mademoiselle
he
added
turning
to
emilie
you
will
kindly
excuse
the
tyranny
of
business
indeed
monsieur
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
no
concern
of
mine
replied
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
looking
at
him
with
a
bold
expression
of
sarcastic
indifference
which
might
have
made
any
one
believe
that
she
now
saw
him
for
the
first
time
do
you
really
mean
it
asked
maximilien
in
a
broken
voice
emilie
turned
her
back
upon
him
with
amazing
insolence
these
words
spoken
in
an
undertone
had
escaped
the
ears
of
her
two
when
after
buying
the
cape
the
three
ladies
got
into
the
carriage
again
emilie
seated
with
her
back
to
the
horses
could
not
resist
one
last
comprehensive
glance
into
the
depths
of
the
odious
shop
where
she
saw
maximilien
standing
with
his
arms
folded
in
the
attitude
of
a
man
superior
to
the
disaster
that
has
so
suddenly
fallen
on
him
their
eyes
met
and
flashed
implacable
looks
each
hoped
to
inflict
a
cruel
wound
on
the
heart
of
a
lover
in
one
instant
they
were
as
far
apart
as
if
one
had
been
in
china
and
the
other
in
greenland
does
not
the
breath
of
vanity
wither
everything
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
a
prey
to
the
most
violent
struggle
that
can
torture
the
heart
of
a
young
girl
reaped
the
richest
harvest
of
anguish
that
prejudice
and
ever
sowed
in
a
human
soul
her
face
but
just
now
fresh
and
velvety
was
streaked
with
yellow
lines
and
red
patches
the
paleness
of
her
cheeks
seemed
every
now
and
then
to
turn
green
hoping
to
hide
her
despair
from
her
sisters
she
would
laugh
as
she
pointed
out
some
ridiculous
dress
or
but
her
laughter
was
spasmodic
she
was
more
deeply
hurt
by
their
unspoken
compassion
than
by
any
satirical
comments
for
which
she
might
have
revenged
herself
she
exhausted
her
wit
in
trying
to
engage
them
in
a
conversation
in
which
she
tried
to
expend
her
fury
in
senseless
paradoxes
heaping
on
all
men
engaged
in
trade
the
bitterest
insults
and
witticisms
in
the
worst
taste
on
getting
home
she
had
an
attack
of
fever
which
at
first
assumed
a
somewhat
serious
character
by
the
end
of
a
month
the
care
of
her
parents
and
of
the
physician
restored
her
to
her
family
every
one
hoped
that
this
lesson
would
be
severe
enough
to
subdue
emilie
s
nature
but
she
insensibly
fell
into
her
old
habits
and
threw
herself
again
into
the
world
of
fashion
she
declared
that
there
was
no
disgrace
in
making
a
mistake
if
she
like
her
father
had
a
vote
in
the
chamber
she
would
move
for
an
edict
she
said
by
which
all
merchants
and
especially
dealers
in
calico
should
be
branded
on
the
forehead
like
berri
sheep
down
to
the
third
generation
she
wished
that
none
but
nobles
should
have
the
right
to
wear
the
antique
french
costume
which
was
so
becoming
to
the
courtiers
of
louis
xv
to
hear
her
it
was
a
misfortune
for
france
perhaps
that
there
was
no
outward
and
visible
difference
between
a
merchant
and
a
peer
of
france
and
a
hundred
more
such
pleasantries
easy
to
imagine
were
rapidly
poured
out
when
any
accident
brought
up
the
subject
but
those
who
loved
emilie
could
see
through
all
her
banter
a
tinge
of
melancholy
it
was
clear
that
maximilien
longueville
still
reigned
over
that
inexorable
heart
sometimes
she
would
be
as
gentle
as
she
had
been
during
the
brief
summer
that
had
seen
the
birth
of
her
love
sometimes
again
she
was
unendurable
every
one
made
excuses
for
her
inequality
of
temper
which
had
its
source
in
sufferings
at
once
secret
and
known
to
all
the
comte
de
kergarouet
had
some
influence
over
her
thanks
to
his
increased
prodigality
a
kind
of
consolation
which
rarely
fails
of
its
effect
on
a
parisian
girl
the
first
ball
at
which
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
appeared
was
at
the
neapolitan
ambassador
s
as
she
took
her
place
in
the
first
quadrille
she
saw
a
few
yards
away
from
her
maximilien
longueville
who
nodded
slightly
to
her
partner
is
that
young
man
a
friend
of
yours
she
asked
with
a
scornful
air
only
my
brother
he
replied
emilie
could
not
help
starting
ah
he
continued
and
he
is
the
noblest
soul
living
do
you
know
my
name
asked
emilie
eagerly
interrupting
him
no
mademoiselle
it
is
a
crime
i
confess
not
to
remember
a
name
which
is
on
every
lip
i
ought
to
say
in
every
heart
but
i
have
a
valid
excuse
i
have
but
just
arrived
from
germany
my
ambassador
who
is
in
paris
on
leave
sent
me
here
this
evening
to
take
care
of
his
amiable
wife
whom
you
may
see
yonder
in
that
a
perfect
tragic
mask
said
emilie
after
looking
at
the
ambassadress
and
yet
that
is
her
ballroom
face
said
the
young
man
laughing
i
shall
have
to
dance
with
her
so
i
thought
i
might
have
some
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
courtesied
i
was
very
much
surprised
the
voluble
young
secretary
went
on
to
find
my
brother
here
on
arriving
from
vienna
i
heard
that
the
poor
boy
was
ill
in
bed
and
i
counted
on
seeing
him
before
coming
to
this
ball
but
good
policy
will
always
allow
us
to
indulge
family
affection
the
padrona
della
case
would
not
give
me
time
to
call
on
my
poor
then
monsieur
your
brother
is
not
like
you
in
diplomatic
no
said
the
attache
with
a
sigh
the
poor
fellow
sacrificed
himself
for
me
he
and
my
sister
clara
have
renounced
their
share
of
my
father
s
fortune
to
make
an
eldest
son
of
me
my
father
dreams
of
a
peerage
like
all
who
vote
for
the
ministry
indeed
it
is
promised
him
he
added
in
an
undertone
after
saving
up
a
little
capital
my
brother
joined
a
banking
firm
and
i
hear
he
has
just
effected
a
speculation
in
brazil
which
may
make
him
a
millionaire
you
see
me
in
the
highest
spirits
at
having
been
able
by
my
diplomatic
connections
to
contribute
to
his
success
i
am
impatiently
expecting
a
dispatch
from
the
brazilian
legation
which
will
help
to
lift
the
cloud
from
his
brow
what
do
you
think
of
him
well
your
brother
s
face
does
not
look
to
me
like
that
of
a
man
busied
with
money
the
young
attache
shot
a
scrutinizing
glance
at
the
apparently
calm
face
of
his
partner
what
he
exclaimed
with
a
smile
can
young
ladies
read
the
thoughts
of
love
behind
the
silent
brow
your
brother
is
in
love
then
she
asked
betrayed
into
a
movement
of
curiosity
yes
my
sister
clara
to
whom
he
is
as
devoted
as
a
mother
wrote
to
me
that
he
had
fallen
in
love
this
summer
with
a
very
pretty
girl
but
i
have
had
no
further
news
of
the
affair
would
you
believe
that
the
poor
boy
used
to
get
up
at
five
in
the
morning
and
went
off
to
settle
his
business
that
he
might
be
back
by
four
o
clock
in
the
country
where
the
lady
was
in
fact
he
ruined
a
very
nice
thoroughbred
that
i
had
just
given
him
forgive
my
chatter
mademoiselle
i
have
but
just
come
home
from
germany
for
a
year
i
have
heard
no
decent
french
i
have
been
weaned
from
french
faces
and
satiated
with
germans
to
such
a
degree
that
i
believe
in
my
patriotic
mania
i
could
talk
to
the
chimeras
on
a
french
candlestick
and
if
i
talk
with
a
lack
of
reserve
unbecoming
in
a
diplomatist
the
fault
is
yours
mademoiselle
was
it
not
you
who
pointed
out
my
brother
when
he
is
the
theme
i
become
inexhaustible
i
should
like
to
proclaim
to
all
the
world
how
good
and
generous
he
is
he
gave
up
no
less
than
a
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
the
income
from
the
longueville
if
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
had
the
benefit
of
these
important
revelations
it
was
partly
due
to
the
skill
with
which
she
continued
to
question
her
confiding
partner
from
the
moment
when
she
found
that
he
was
the
brother
of
her
scorned
lover
and
could
you
without
being
grieved
see
your
brother
selling
muslin
and
calico
asked
emilie
at
the
end
of
the
third
figure
of
the
quadrille
how
do
you
know
that
asked
the
attache
thank
god
though
i
pour
out
a
flood
of
words
i
have
already
acquired
the
art
of
not
telling
more
than
i
intend
like
all
the
other
diplomatic
apprentices
i
you
told
me
i
assure
monsieur
de
longueville
looked
at
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
with
a
surprise
that
was
full
of
perspicacity
a
suspicion
flashed
upon
him
he
glanced
inquiringly
from
his
brother
to
his
partner
guessed
everything
clasped
his
hands
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
ceiling
and
began
to
laugh
saying
i
am
an
idiot
you
are
the
handsomest
person
here
my
brother
keeps
stealing
glances
at
you
he
is
dancing
in
spite
of
his
illness
and
you
pretend
not
to
see
him
make
him
happy
he
added
as
he
led
her
back
to
her
old
uncle
i
shall
not
be
jealous
but
i
shall
always
shiver
a
little
at
calling
you
my
sister
the
lovers
however
were
to
prove
as
inexorable
to
each
other
as
they
were
to
themselves
at
about
two
in
the
morning
refreshments
were
served
in
an
immense
corridor
where
to
leave
persons
of
the
same
coterie
free
to
meet
each
other
the
tables
were
arranged
as
in
a
restaurant
by
one
of
those
accidents
which
always
happen
to
lovers
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
found
herself
at
a
table
next
to
that
at
which
the
more
important
guests
were
seated
maximilien
was
of
the
group
emilie
who
lent
an
attentive
ear
to
her
neighbors
conversation
overheard
one
of
those
dialogues
into
which
a
young
woman
so
easily
falls
with
a
young
man
who
has
the
grace
and
style
of
maximilien
longueville
the
lady
talking
to
the
young
banker
was
a
neapolitan
duchess
whose
eyes
shot
lightning
flashes
and
whose
skin
had
the
sheen
of
satin
the
intimate
terms
on
which
longueville
affected
to
be
with
her
stung
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
all
the
more
because
she
had
just
given
her
lover
back
twenty
times
as
much
tenderness
as
she
had
ever
felt
for
him
before
yes
monsieur
in
my
country
true
love
can
make
every
kind
of
sacrifice
the
duchess
was
saying
in
a
simper
you
have
more
passion
than
frenchwomen
said
maximilien
whose
burning
gaze
fell
on
emilie
they
are
all
monsieur
emilie
eagerly
interposed
is
it
not
very
wrong
to
calumniate
your
own
country
devotion
is
to
be
found
in
every
do
you
imagine
mademoiselle
retorted
the
italian
with
a
sardonic
smile
that
a
parisian
would
be
capable
of
following
her
lover
all
over
the
world
oh
madame
let
us
understand
each
other
she
would
follow
him
to
a
desert
and
live
in
a
tent
but
not
to
sit
in
a
a
disdainful
gesture
completed
her
meaning
thus
under
the
influence
of
her
disastrous
education
emile
for
the
second
time
killed
her
budding
happiness
and
destroyed
its
prospects
of
life
maximilien
s
apparent
indifference
and
a
woman
s
smile
had
wrung
from
her
one
of
those
sarcasms
whose
treacherous
zest
always
let
her
astray
mademoiselle
said
longueville
in
a
low
voice
under
cover
of
the
noise
made
by
the
ladies
as
they
rose
from
the
table
no
one
will
ever
more
ardently
desire
your
happiness
than
i
permit
me
to
assure
you
of
this
as
i
am
taking
leave
of
you
i
am
starting
for
italy
in
a
few
with
a
duchess
no
doubt
no
but
perhaps
with
a
mortal
is
not
that
pure
fancy
asked
emilie
with
an
anxious
glance
no
he
replied
there
are
wounds
which
never
you
are
not
to
go
said
the
girl
imperiously
and
she
smiled
i
shall
go
replied
maximilien
gravely
you
will
find
me
married
on
your
return
i
warn
you
she
said
coquettishly
i
hope
impertinent
wretch
she
exclaimed
how
cruel
a
revenge
a
fortnight
later
maximilien
set
out
with
his
sister
clara
for
the
warm
and
poetic
scenes
of
beautiful
italy
leaving
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
a
prey
to
the
most
vehement
regret
the
young
secretary
to
the
embassy
took
up
his
brother
s
quarrel
and
contrived
to
take
signal
vengeance
on
emilie
s
disdain
by
making
known
the
occasion
of
the
lovers
separation
he
repaid
his
fair
partner
with
interest
all
the
sarcasm
with
which
she
had
formerly
attacked
maximilien
and
often
made
more
than
one
excellency
smile
by
describing
the
fair
foe
of
the
the
amazon
who
preached
a
crusade
against
bankers
the
young
girl
whose
love
had
evaporated
before
a
bale
of
muslin
the
comte
de
fontaine
was
obliged
to
use
his
influence
to
procure
an
appointment
to
russia
for
auguste
longueville
in
order
to
protect
his
daughter
from
the
ridicule
heaped
upon
her
by
this
dangerous
young
persecutor
not
long
after
the
ministry
being
compelled
to
raise
a
levy
of
peers
to
support
the
aristocratic
party
trembling
in
the
upper
chamber
under
the
lash
of
an
illustrious
writer
gave
monsieur
guiraudin
de
longueville
a
peerage
with
the
title
of
vicomte
monsieur
de
fontaine
also
obtained
a
peerage
the
reward
due
as
much
to
his
fidelity
in
evil
days
as
to
his
name
which
claimed
a
place
in
the
hereditary
chamber
about
this
time
emilie
now
of
age
made
no
doubt
some
serious
reflections
on
life
for
her
tone
and
manners
changed
perceptibly
instead
of
amusing
herself
by
saying
spiteful
things
to
her
uncle
she
lavished
on
him
the
most
affectionate
attentions
she
brought
him
his
stick
with
a
persevering
devotion
that
made
the
cynical
smile
she
gave
him
her
arm
rode
in
his
carriage
and
accompanied
him
in
all
his
drives
she
even
persuaded
him
that
she
liked
the
smell
of
tobacco
and
read
him
his
favorite
paper
la
quotidienne
in
the
midst
of
clouds
of
smoke
which
the
malicious
old
sailor
intentionally
blew
over
her
she
learned
piquet
to
be
a
match
for
the
old
count
and
this
fantastic
damsel
even
listened
without
impatience
to
his
periodical
narratives
of
the
battles
of
the
the
manoeuvres
of
the
ville
de
paris
de
suffren
s
first
expedition
or
the
battle
of
aboukir
though
the
old
sailor
had
often
said
that
he
knew
his
longitude
and
latitude
too
well
to
allow
himself
to
be
captured
by
a
young
corvette
one
fine
morning
paris
heard
the
news
of
the
marriage
of
mademoiselle
de
fontaine
to
the
comte
de
kergarouet
the
young
countess
gave
splendid
entertainments
to
drown
thought
but
she
no
doubt
found
a
void
at
the
bottom
of
the
whirlpool
luxury
was
ineffectual
to
disguise
the
emptiness
and
grief
of
her
sorrowing
soul
for
the
most
part
in
spite
of
the
flashes
of
assumed
gaiety
her
beautiful
face
expressed
unspoken
melancholy
emilie
appeared
however
full
of
attentions
and
consideration
for
her
old
husband
who
on
retiring
to
his
rooms
at
night
to
the
sounds
of
a
lively
band
would
often
say
i
do
not
know
myself
was
i
to
wait
till
the
age
of
to
embark
as
pilot
on
board
the
belle
emilie
after
twenty
years
of
matrimonial
galleys
the
conduct
of
the
young
countess
was
marked
by
such
strictness
that
the
most
criticism
had
no
fault
to
find
with
her
lookers
on
chose
to
think
that
the
had
reserved
the
right
of
disposing
of
his
fortune
to
keep
his
wife
more
tightly
in
hand
but
this
was
a
notion
as
insulting
to
the
uncle
as
to
the
niece
their
conduct
was
indeed
so
delicately
judicious
that
the
men
who
were
most
interested
in
guessing
the
secrets
of
the
couple
could
never
decide
whether
the
old
count
regarded
her
as
a
wife
or
as
a
daughter
he
was
often
heard
to
say
that
he
had
rescued
his
niece
as
a
castaway
after
shipwreck
and
that
for
his
part
he
had
never
taken
a
mean
advantage
of
hospitality
when
he
had
saved
an
enemy
from
the
fury
of
the
storm
though
the
countess
aspired
to
reign
in
paris
and
tried
to
keep
pace
with
mesdames
the
duchesses
de
maufrigneuse
and
du
chaulieu
the
marquises
d
espard
and
d
aiglemont
the
comtesses
feraud
de
montcornet
and
de
restaud
madame
de
camps
and
mademoiselle
des
touches
she
did
not
yield
to
the
addresses
of
the
young
vicomte
de
portenduere
who
made
her
his
idol
two
years
after
her
marriage
in
one
of
the
old
in
the
faubourg
where
she
was
admired
for
her
character
worthy
of
the
old
school
emilie
heard
the
vicomte
de
longueville
announced
in
the
corner
of
the
room
where
she
was
sitting
playing
piquet
with
the
bishop
of
persepolis
her
agitation
was
not
observed
she
turned
her
head
and
saw
her
former
lover
come
in
in
all
the
freshness
of
youth
his
father
s
death
and
then
that
of
his
brother
killed
by
the
severe
climate
of
had
placed
on
maximilien
s
head
the
hereditary
plumes
of
the
french
peer
s
hat
his
fortune
matched
his
learning
and
his
merits
only
the
day
before
his
youthful
and
fervid
eloquence
had
dazzled
the
assembly
at
this
moment
he
stood
before
the
countess
free
and
graced
with
all
the
advantages
she
had
formerly
required
of
her
ideal
every
mother
with
a
daughter
to
marry
made
amiable
advances
to
a
man
gifted
with
the
virtues
which
they
attributed
to
him
as
they
admired
his
attractive
person
but
emilie
knew
better
than
any
one
that
the
vicomte
de
longueville
had
the
steadfast
nature
in
which
a
wise
woman
sees
a
guarantee
of
happiness
she
looked
at
the
admiral
who
to
use
his
favorite
expression
seemed
likely
