the
rubáiyát
of
a
persian
kitten
wake
for
the
golden
cat
has
put
to
flight
the
mouse
of
darkness
with
his
paw
of
light
which
means
in
plain
and
simple
unoriental
speech
the
dawn
is
bright
illustration
they
say
the
early
bird
the
worm
shall
taste
then
rise
o
kitten
wherefore
sleeping
waste
the
fruits
of
virtue
quick
the
early
bird
will
soon
be
on
the
flutter
o
make
haste
illustration
the
early
bird
has
gone
and
with
him
the
early
worm
alas
the
moral
plain
o
senseless
worm
thus
thus
we
are
repaid
for
early
rising
i
shall
doze
again
illustration
the
mouse
makes
merry
the
larder
shelves
the
bird
for
dinner
in
the
garden
delves
i
often
wonder
what
the
creatures
eat
one
half
so
toothsome
as
they
are
themselves
illustration
and
that
inverted
bowl
of
skyblue
delf
that
helpless
lies
upon
the
pantry
shelf
lift
not
your
eyes
to
it
for
help
for
it
is
quite
as
empty
as
you
are
yourself
illustration
the
ball
no
question
makes
of
ayes
or
noes
but
right
or
left
as
strikes
the
kitten
goes
yet
why
altho
i
toss
it
far
afield
it
still
returneth
goodness
only
knows
illustration
a
secret
presence
that
my
likeness
feigns
and
yet
eludes
my
pains
in
vain
i
look
for
him
behind
the
glass
he
is
not
there
and
yet
he
still
remains
illustration
what
out
of
airy
nothing
to
invoke
a
senseless
something
to
resist
the
stroke
of
unpermitted
paw
upon
the
pain
of
everlasting
penalties
if
broke
illustration
i
sometimes
think
the
grey
are
angel
kittens
who
have
lost
their
way
and
every
bulrush
on
the
river
bank
a
from
some
lovely
cat
astray
illustration
sometimes
i
think
perchance
that
allah
may
when
he
created
cats
have
thrown
away
the
tails
he
marred
in
making
and
they
grew
to
and
to
grey
illustration
and
lately
when
i
was
not
feeling
fit
bereft
alike
of
piety
and
wit
there
came
an
angel
shape
and
offered
me
a
fragrant
plant
and
bid
me
taste
of
it
illustration
was
that
reviving
herb
that
spicy
weed
the
tho
is
good
in
time
of
need
ah
feed
upon
it
lightly
for
who
knows
to
what
unlovely
antics
it
may
lead
illustration
strange
is
it
not
that
of
the
numbers
who
before
me
passed
this
door
of
darkness
thro
not
one
returns
thro
it
again
ofttimes
i
waited
here
an
hour
or
two
illustration
is
but
a
tent
where
takes
his
one
night
rest
a
rodent
to
the
realms
of
death
address
when
cook
arising
looks
for
him
and
then
baits
and
prepares
it
for
another
guest
illustration
they
say
the
lion
and
the
lizard
keep
the
courts
where
jamshýd
gloried
and
drank
deep
the
lion
is
my
cousin
i
do
know
who
jamshýd
is
nor
shall
it
break
my
sleep
illustration
impotent
glimpses
of
the
game
displayed
upon
the
counter
temptingly
arrayed
hither
and
thither
moved
or
checked
or
weighed
and
one
by
one
back
in
the
ice
chest
laid
illustration
what
if
the
sole
could
fling
the
ice
aside
and
with
me
to
some
area
haven
glide
not
a
shame
not
a
shame
for
it
in
this
cold
prison
crippled
to
abide
illustration
some
for
the
glories
of
the
sole
and
some
mew
for
the
proper
bowl
of
milk
to
come
ah
take
the
fish
and
let
your
credit
go
and
plead
the
rumble
of
an
empty
tum
illustration
one
thing
is
certain
tho
this
stolen
bite
should
be
my
last
and
wrath
consume
me
quite
one
taste
of
it
within
the
area
caught
better
than
at
the
table
lost
outright
illustration
indeed
indeed
repentance
oft
before
i
swore
but
was
i
hungry
when
i
swore
and
then
and
then
came
cook
with
hose
in
hand
and
drowned
my
glory
in
a
sorry
pour
illustration
what
without
asking
hither
harried
whence
and
without
asking
whither
harried
hence
o
many
a
taste
of
that
forbidden
sole
must
down
the
memory
of
that
insolence
illustration
heaven
but
the
vision
of
a
flowing
bowl
and
hell
the
sizzle
of
a
frying
sole
heard
in
the
hungry
darkness
where
myself
so
rudely
cast
must
impotently
roll
illustration
the
vine
has
a
tough
fibre
which
about
while
clings
my
being
let
the
canine
flout
till
his
bass
voice
be
pitched
to
such
loud
key
it
shall
unlock
the
door
i
mew
without
illustration
up
from
the
basement
to
the
seventh
flat
i
rose
and
on
the
crown
of
fashion
sat
and
many
a
ball
unravelled
by
the
way
but
not
the
master
angry
bawl
of
scat
illustration
then
to
the
well
of
wisdom
i
and
lo
with
my
own
paw
i
wrought
to
make
it
flow
and
this
was
all
the
harvest
that
i
reaped
we
come
like
kittens
and
like
cats
we
go
illustration
why
be
this
ink
the
fount
of
wit
who
dare
blaspheme
the
glistening
as
a
snare
a
blessing
i
should
spread
it
should
i
not
and
if
a
curse
why
then
upset
it
there
illustration
a
moment
halt
a
momentary
taste
of
bitter
and
amid
the
trickling
waste
i
wrought
strange
shapes
from
máh
to
máhi
yet
i
know
not
what
i
wrote
nor
why
they
chased
illustration
now
i
beyond
the
pale
am
safely
past
o
but
the
long
long
time
their
rage
shall
last
which
tho
they
call
to
supper
i
shall
heed
as
a
stone
cat
should
heed
a
pebble
cast
illustration
and
that
perverted
soul
beneath
the
sky
they
call
the
dog
heed
not
his
angry
cry
not
all
his
threats
can
make
me
budge
one
bit
nor
all
his
empty
bluster
terrify
illustration
they
are
no
other
than
a
moving
show
of
whirling
shadow
shapes
that
come
and
go
thro
moon
illumined
darkness
hurled
in
midnight
by
the
lodgers
in
the
row
illustration
myself
when
young
did
eagerly
frequent
the
backyard
fence
and
heard
great
argument
about
it
and
about
yet
evermore
came
out
with
fewer
fur
than
in
i
went
illustration
ah
me
if
you
and
i
could
but
conspire
to
grasp
this
sorry
scheme
of
things
entire
would
we
not
shatter
it
to
bits
and
then
enfold
it
nearer
to
our
heart
desire
illustration
tho
two
and
two
make
four
by
rule
of
line
or
they
make
by
logic
fine
of
all
the
figures
one
may
fathom
i
shall
be
floored
by
anything
but
nine
illustration
and
fear
not
lest
existence
shut
the
door
on
you
and
me
to
open
it
no
more
the
cream
of
life
from
out
your
bowl
shall
pour
nine
times
ere
it
lie
broken
on
the
floor
illustration
so
if
the
fish
you
steal
the
cream
you
drink
ends
in
what
all
begins
and
ends
in
think
unless
the
stern
recorder
points
to
nine
tho
they
would
drown
you
still
you
shall
not
sink
