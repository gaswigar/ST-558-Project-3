i
the
rising
of
the
curtain
you
come
to
the
row
of
hovels
that
leads
to
the
gate
of
the
city
they
are
built
of
dried
mud
and
so
dilapidated
that
you
feel
a
breath
of
wind
will
lay
them
flat
upon
the
dusty
earth
from
which
they
have
been
made
a
string
of
camels
heavily
laden
steps
warily
past
you
they
wear
the
disdainful
air
of
profiteers
forced
to
traverse
a
world
in
which
many
people
are
not
so
rich
as
they
a
little
crowd
tattered
in
their
blue
clothes
is
gathered
about
the
gate
and
it
scatters
as
a
youth
in
a
pointed
cap
gallops
up
on
a
mongolian
pony
a
band
of
children
are
chasing
a
lame
dog
and
they
throw
clods
of
mud
at
it
two
stout
gentlemen
in
long
black
gowns
of
figured
silk
and
silk
jackets
stand
talking
to
one
another
each
holds
a
little
stick
perched
on
which
with
a
string
attached
to
its
leg
is
a
little
bird
they
have
brought
out
their
pets
for
an
airing
and
in
friendly
fashion
compare
their
merits
now
and
then
the
birds
give
a
flutter
into
the
air
the
length
of
the
string
and
return
quickly
to
their
perch
the
two
chinese
gentlemen
smiling
look
at
them
with
soft
eyes
rude
boys
cry
out
at
the
foreigner
in
a
shrill
and
scornful
voice
the
city
wall
crumbling
old
and
crenellated
looks
like
the
city
wall
in
an
old
picture
of
some
palestinish
town
of
the
crusaders
you
pass
through
the
gateway
into
a
narrow
street
lined
with
shops
many
of
them
with
their
elegant
lattice
work
red
and
gold
and
their
elaborate
carving
have
a
peculiar
ruined
magnificence
and
you
imagine
that
in
their
dark
recesses
are
sold
all
manner
of
strange
wares
of
the
fabulous
east
a
great
multitude
surges
along
the
uneven
narrow
footwalk
or
in
the
deepset
street
and
coolies
bearing
heavy
loads
shout
for
way
in
short
sharp
cries
hawkers
with
guttural
sound
call
their
wares
and
now
at
a
sedate
pace
drawn
by
a
sleek
mule
comes
a
peking
cart
its
hood
is
bright
blue
and
its
great
wheels
are
studded
with
nails
the
driver
sits
with
dangling
legs
on
a
shaft
it
is
evening
and
the
sun
sets
red
behind
the
yellow
steep
and
fantastic
roof
of
a
temple
the
peking
cart
the
blind
in
front
drawn
down
passes
silently
and
you
wonder
who
it
is
that
sits
within
perhaps
it
is
a
scholar
all
the
learning
of
the
classics
at
his
finger
ends
bound
on
a
visit
to
a
friend
with
whom
he
will
exchange
elaborate
compliments
and
discuss
the
golden
age
of
tang
and
sung
which
can
return
no
more
perhaps
it
is
a
singing
girl
in
splendid
silks
and
richly
embroidered
coat
with
jade
in
her
black
hair
summoned
to
a
party
so
that
she
may
sing
a
little
song
and
exchange
elegant
repartee
with
young
blades
cultured
enough
to
appreciate
wit
the
peking
cart
disappears
into
the
gathering
darkness
it
seems
to
carry
all
the
mystery
of
the
east
ii
my
lady
parlour
i
really
think
i
can
make
something
of
it
she
said
she
looked
about
her
briskly
and
the
light
of
the
creative
imagination
filled
her
eyes
with
brightness
it
was
an
old
temple
a
small
one
in
the
city
which
she
had
taken
and
was
turning
into
a
dwelling
house
it
had
been
built
for
a
very
holy
monk
by
his
admirers
three
hundred
years
before
and
here
in
great
piety
practising
innumerable
austerities
he
had
passed
his
declining
days
for
long
after
in
memory
of
his
virtue
the
faithful
had
come
to
worship
but
in
course
of
time
funds
had
fallen
very
low
and
at
last
the
two
or
three
monks
that
remained
were
forced
to
leave
it
was
and
the
green
tiles
of
the
roof
were
overgrown
with
weeds
the
raftered
ceiling
was
still
beautiful
with
its
faded
gold
dragons
on
a
faded
red
but
she
did
not
like
a
dark
ceiling
so
she
stretched
a
canvas
across
and
papered
it
needing
air
and
sunlight
she
cut
two
large
windows
on
one
side
she
very
luckily
had
some
blue
curtains
which
were
just
the
right
size
blue
was
her
favourite
colour
it
brought
out
the
colour
of
her
eyes
since
the
columns
great
red
sturdy
columns
oppressed
her
a
little
she
papered
them
with
a
very
nice
paper
which
did
not
look
chinese
at
all
she
was
lucky
also
with
the
paper
with
which
she
covered
the
walls
it
was
bought
in
a
native
shop
but
really
it
might
have
come
from
sandersons
it
was
a
very
nice
pink
stripe
and
it
made
the
place
look
cheerful
at
once
at
the
back
was
a
recess
in
which
had
stood
a
great
lacquer
table
and
behind
it
an
image
of
the
buddha
in
his
eternal
meditation
here
generations
of
believers
had
burned
their
tapers
and
prayed
some
for
this
temporal
benefit
or
that
some
for
release
from
the
returning
burden
of
earthly
existence
and
this
seemed
to
her
the
very
place
for
an
american
stove
she
was
obliged
to
buy
her
carpet
in
china
but
she
managed
to
get
one
that
looked
so
like
an
axminster
that
you
would
hardly
know
the
difference
of
course
being
it
had
not
quite
the
smoothness
of
the
english
article
but
it
was
a
very
decent
substitute
she
was
able
to
buy
a
very
nice
lot
of
furniture
from
a
member
of
the
legation
who
was
leaving
the
country
for
a
post
in
rome
and
she
got
a
nice
bright
chintz
from
shanghai
to
make
loose
covers
with
fortunately
she
had
quite
a
number
of
pictures
wedding
presents
and
some
even
that
she
had
bought
herself
for
she
was
very
artistic
and
these
gave
the
room
a
cosy
look
she
needed
a
screen
and
here
there
was
no
help
for
it
she
had
to
buy
a
chinese
one
but
as
she
very
cleverly
said
you
might
perfectly
well
have
a
chinese
screen
in
england
she
had
a
great
many
photographs
in
silver
frames
one
of
them
of
a
princess
of
and
one
of
the
queen
of
sweden
both
signed
and
these
she
put
on
the
grand
piano
for
they
give
a
room
an
air
of
being
lived
in
then
having
finished
she
surveyed
her
work
with
satisfaction
of
course
it
does
look
like
a
room
in
london
she
said
but
it
might
quite
well
be
a
room
in
some
nice
place
in
england

iii
the
mongol
chief
heaven
knows
from
what
mysterious
distance
he
had
come
he
rode
down
the
winding
pathway
from
the
high
mongolian
plateau
with
the
mountains
barren
stony
and
inaccessible
stretching
on
all
sides
an
impenetrable
barrier
he
rode
down
past
the
temple
that
guarded
the
head
of
the
pass
till
he
came
to
the
old
river
bed
which
was
the
gateway
into
china
it
was
hedged
in
by
the
foothills
brilliant
under
the
morning
sun
with
sharp
shadows
and
the
innumerable
traffic
of
the
centuries
had
formed
on
that
stony
floor
a
rough
road
the
air
was
keen
and
clear
the
sky
was
blue
here
all
the
year
round
from
daybreak
till
sundown
passed
an
unending
stream
camels
in
caravan
bearing
the
brick
tea
to
urga
seven
hundred
miles
away
and
so
to
siberia
long
lines
of
wagons
drawn
by
placid
bullocks
and
little
carts
in
twos
and
threes
behind
stout
ponies
and
in
the
contrary
direction
into
china
again
camels
in
caravan
bringing
hides
to
the
markets
of
peking
and
wagons
in
long
procession
now
a
mob
of
horses
went
by
and
then
a
flock
of
goats
but
his
eyes
did
not
rest
on
the
various
scene
he
seemed
not
to
notice
that
others
were
travelling
the
pass
he
was
accompanied
by
his
henchmen
six
or
seven
of
them
somewhat
bedraggled
it
is
true
on
sorry
nags
but
they
had
a
truculent
air
they
ambled
along
in
a
slovenly
bunch
he
was
dressed
in
a
black
silk
coat
and
black
silk
trousers
thrust
into
his
long
riding
boots
with
their
toes
and
on
his
head
he
wore
the
high
sable
cap
of
his
country
he
held
himself
erect
riding
a
little
ahead
of
his
followers
proudly
and
as
he
rode
his
head
high
and
his
eyes
steady
you
wondered
if
he
thought
that
down
this
pass
in
days
gone
by
his
ancestors
had
ridden
ridden
down
upon
the
fertile
plain
of
china
where
rich
cities
lay
ready
to
their
looting
iv
the
rolling
stone
i
heard
his
extraordinary
story
before
i
saw
him
and
i
expected
someone
of
striking
appearance
it
seemed
to
me
that
anyone
who
had
gone
through
such
singular
experiences
must
have
in
his
outer
man
something
singular
too
but
i
found
a
person
in
whose
aspect
there
was
nothing
remarkable
he
was
smaller
than
the
average
somewhat
frail
with
hair
beginning
to
turn
grey
though
he
was
still
under
thirty
and
brown
eyes
he
looked
like
anybody
else
and
you
might
see
him
half
a
dozen
times
before
remembering
who
he
was
if
you
had
happened
upon
him
behind
the
counter
of
a
department
store
or
on
a
stool
in
a
broker
office
you
would
have
thought
him
perfectly
in
place
but
you
would
have
noticed
him
as
little
as
you
noticed
the
counter
or
the
stool
there
was
so
little
in
him
to
attract
attention
that
in
the
end
it
became
intriguing
his
face
empty
of
significance
reminded
you
of
the
blank
wall
of
a
manchu
palace
in
a
sordid
street
behind
which
you
knew
were
painted
courtyards
carved
dragons
and
heaven
knows
what
subtle
intricacy
of
life
for
his
whole
career
was
remarkable
the
son
of
a
veterinary
surgeon
he
had
been
a
reporter
in
the
london
police
courts
and
then
had
gone
as
steward
on
board
a
merchant
ship
to
buenos
ayres
there
he
had
deserted
and
somehow
or
other
had
worked
his
way
across
south
america
from
a
port
in
chili
he
managed
to
get
to
the
marquesas
where
for
six
months
he
had
lived
on
the
natives
always
ready
to
offer
hospitality
to
a
white
man
and
then
begging
a
passage
on
a
schooner
to
tahiti
had
shipped
to
amoy
as
second
mate
of
an
old
tub
which
carried
chinese
labour
to
the
society
islands
that
was
nine
years
before
i
met
him
and
since
then
he
had
lived
in
china
first
he
got
work
with
the
company
but
after
a
couple
of
years
he
found
it
monotonous
and
having
acquired
a
certain
knowledge
of
the
language
he
entered
the
employment
of
a
firm
which
distributed
patent
medicines
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
for
three
years
he
wandered
in
province
after
province
selling
pills
and
at
the
end
of
it
had
saved
eight
hundred
dollars
he
cut
himself
adrift
once
more
he
began
then
the
most
remarkable
of
his
adventures
he
set
out
from
peking
on
a
journey
right
across
the
country
travelling
in
the
guise
of
a
poor
chinaman
with
his
roll
of
bedding
his
chinese
pipe
and
his
he
stayed
in
the
chinese
inns
sleeping
on
the
kangs
huddled
up
with
fellow
wayfarers
and
ate
the
chinese
food
this
alone
is
no
mean
feat
he
used
the
train
but
little
going
for
the
most
part
on
foot
by
cart
or
by
river
he
went
through
shensi
and
shansi
he
walked
on
the
windy
plateaus
of
mongolia
and
risked
his
life
in
barbaric
turkestan
he
spent
long
weeks
with
the
nomads
of
the
desert
and
travelled
with
the
caravans
that
carried
the
brick
tea
across
the
arid
wilderness
of
gobi
at
last
four
years
later
having
spent
his
last
dollar
he
reached
peking
once
more
he
set
about
looking
for
a
job
the
easiest
way
to
earn
money
seemed
to
write
and
the
editor
of
one
of
the
english
papers
in
china
offered
to
take
a
series
of
articles
on
his
journey
i
suppose
his
only
difficulty
was
to
choose
from
the
fulness
of
his
experience
he
knew
much
which
he
was
perhaps
the
only
englishman
to
know
he
had
seen
all
manner
of
things
quaint
impressive
terrible
amusing
and
unexpected
he
wrote
articles
i
will
not
say
that
they
were
unreadable
for
they
showed
a
careful
and
a
sympathetic
observation
but
he
had
seen
everything
at
haphazard
as
it
were
and
they
were
but
the
material
of
art
they
were
like
the
catalogue
of
the
army
and
navy
stores
a
mine
to
the
imaginative
man
but
the
foundation
of
literature
rather
than
literature
itself
he
was
the
field
naturalist
who
patiently
collects
an
infinity
of
facts
but
has
no
gift
for
generalisation
they
remain
facts
that
await
the
synthesis
of
minds
more
complicated
than
his
he
collected
neither
plants
nor
beasts
but
men
his
collection
was
unrivalled
but
his
knowledge
of
it
slender
when
i
met
him
i
sought
to
discern
how
the
variety
of
his
experience
had
affected
him
but
though
he
was
full
of
anecdote
a
jovial
friendly
creature
willing
to
talk
at
length
of
all
he
had
seen
i
could
not
discover
that
any
of
his
adventures
had
intimately
touched
him
the
instinct
to
do
all
the
queer
things
he
had
done
showed
that
there
was
in
him
a
streak
of
queerness
the
civilised
world
irked
him
and
he
had
a
passion
to
get
away
from
the
beaten
trail
the
oddities
of
life
amused
him
he
had
an
insatiable
curiosity
but
i
think
his
experiences
were
merely
of
the
body
and
were
never
translated
into
experiences
of
the
soul
perhaps
that
is
why
at
bottom
you
felt
he
was
commonplace
the
insignificance
of
his
mien
was
a
true
index
to
the
insignificance
of
his
soul
behind
the
blank
wall
was
blankness
that
was
certainly
why
with
so
much
to
write
about
he
wrote
tediously
for
in
writing
the
important
thing
is
less
richness
of
material
than
richness
of
personality
v
the
cabinet
minister
he
received
me
in
a
long
room
looking
on
to
a
sandy
garden
the
roses
withered
on
the
stunted
bushes
and
the
great
old
trees
flagged
forlorn
he
sat
me
down
on
a
square
stool
at
a
square
table
and
took
his
seat
in
front
of
me
a
servant
brought
cups
of
flowered
tea
and
american
cigarettes
he
was
a
thin
man
of
the
middle
height
with
thin
elegant
hands
and
through
his
spectacles
he
looked
at
me
with
large
dark
and
melancholy
eyes
he
had
the
look
of
a
student
or
of
a
dreamer
his
smile
was
very
sweet
he
wore
a
brown
silk
gown
and
over
it
a
short
black
silk
jacket
and
on
his
head
a
billycock
hat
is
it
not
strange
he
said
with
his
charming
smile
that
we
chinese
wear
this
gown
because
three
hundred
years
ago
the
manchus
were
horsemen
not
so
strange
i
retorted
as
that
because
the
english
won
the
battle
of
waterloo
your
excellency
should
wear
a
bowler
do
you
think
that
is
why
i
wear
it
i
could
easily
prove
it
since
i
was
afraid
that
his
exquisite
courtesy
would
prevent
him
from
asking
me
how
i
hastened
in
a
few
words
to
do
so
he
took
off
his
hat
and
looked
at
it
with
the
shadow
of
a
sigh
i
glanced
round
the
room
it
had
a
green
brussels
carpet
with
great
flowers
on
it
and
round
the
walls
were
highly
carved
blackwood
chairs
from
a
picture
rail
hung
scrolls
on
which
were
writings
by
the
great
masters
of
the
past
and
to
vary
these
in
bright
gold
frames
were
oil
paintings
which
in
the
nineties
might
very
well
have
been
exhibited
in
the
royal
academy
the
minister
did
his
work
at
an
american
desk
he
talked
to
me
with
melancholy
of
the
state
of
china
a
civilisation
the
oldest
the
world
had
known
was
now
being
ruthlessly
swept
away
the
students
who
came
back
from
europe
and
from
america
were
tearing
down
what
endless
generations
had
built
up
and
they
were
placing
nothing
in
its
stead
they
had
no
love
of
their
country
no
religion
no
reverence
the
temples
deserted
by
worshipper
and
priest
were
falling
into
decay
and
presently
their
beauty
would
be
nothing
but
a
memory
but
then
with
a
gesture
of
his
thin
aristocratic
hands
he
put
the
subject
aside
he
asked
me
whether
i
would
care
to
see
some
of
his
works
of
art
we
walked
round
the
room
and
he
showed
me
priceless
porcelains
bronzes
and
tang
figures
there
was
a
horse
from
a
grave
in
honan
which
had
the
grace
and
the
exquisite
modelling
of
a
greek
work
on
a
large
table
by
the
side
of
his
desk
was
a
number
of
rolls
he
chose
one
and
holding
it
at
the
top
gave
it
to
me
to
unroll
it
was
a
picture
of
some
early
dynasty
of
mountains
seen
through
fleecy
clouds
and
with
smiling
eyes
he
watched
my
pleasure
as
i
looked
the
picture
was
set
aside
and
he
showed
me
another
and
yet
another
presently
i
protested
that
i
could
not
allow
a
busy
man
to
waste
his
time
on
me
but
he
would
not
let
me
go
he
brought
out
picture
after
picture
he
was
a
connoisseur
he
was
pleased
to
tell
me
the
schools
and
periods
to
which
they
belonged
and
neat
anecdotes
about
their
painters
i
wish
i
could
think
it
was
possible
for
you
to
appreciate
my
greatest
treasures
he
said
pointing
to
the
scrolls
that
adorned
his
walls
here
you
have
examples
of
the
most
perfect
calligraphies
of
china
do
you
like
them
better
than
paintings
i
asked
infinitely
their
beauty
is
more
chaste
there
is
nothing
meretricious
in
them
but
i
can
quite
understand
that
a
european
would
have
difficulty
in
appreciating
so
severe
and
so
delicate
an
art
your
taste
in
chinese
things
tends
a
little
to
the
grotesque
i
think
he
produced
books
of
paintings
and
i
turned
their
leaves
beautiful
things
with
the
dramatic
instinct
of
the
collector
he
kept
to
the
last
the
book
by
which
he
set
most
store
it
was
a
series
of
little
pictures
of
birds
and
flowers
roughly
done
with
a
few
strokes
but
with
such
a
power
of
suggestion
with
so
great
a
feeling
for
nature
and
such
a
playful
tenderness
that
it
took
your
breath
away
there
were
sprigs
of
that
held
in
their
dainty
freshness
all
the
magic
of
the
spring
there
were
sparrows
in
whose
ruffled
plumage
were
the
beat
and
the
tremor
of
life
it
was
the
work
of
a
great
artist
will
these
american
students
ever
produce
anything
like
this
he
asked
with
a
rueful
smile
but
to
me
the
most
charming
part
of
it
was
that
i
knew
all
the
time
that
he
was
a
rascal
corrupt
inefficient
and
unscrupulous
he
let
nothing
stand
in
his
way
he
was
a
master
of
the
squeeze
he
had
acquired
a
large
fortune
by
the
most
abominable
methods
he
was
dishonest
cruel
vindictive
and
venal
he
had
certainly
had
a
share
in
reducing
china
to
the
desperate
plight
which
he
so
sincerely
lamented
but
when
he
held
in
his
hand
a
little
vase
of
the
colour
of
lapis
lazuli
his
fingers
seemed
to
curl
about
it
with
a
charming
tenderness
his
melancholy
eyes
caressed
it
as
they
looked
and
his
lips
were
slightly
parted
as
though
with
a
sigh
of
desire
vi
dinner
parties
i
legation
quarter
the
swiss
director
of
the
banque
was
announced
he
came
with
a
large
handsome
wife
who
displayed
her
opulent
charms
so
generously
that
it
made
you
a
little
nervous
it
was
said
that
she
had
been
a
and
an
english
maiden
lady
in
salmon
pink
satin
and
beads
who
had
come
early
greeted
her
with
a
thin
and
frigid
smile
the
minister
of
guatemala
and
the
chargé
of
montenegro
entered
together
the
chargé
was
in
a
state
of
extreme
agitation
he
had
not
understood
that
it
was
an
official
function
he
thought
he
had
been
asked
to
dine
petit
and
he
had
not
put
on
his
orders
and
there
was
the
minister
of
guatemala
blazing
with
stars
what
in
heaven
name
was
to
be
done
the
emotion
caused
by
what
for
a
moment
seemed
almost
a
diplomatic
incident
was
diverted
by
the
appearance
of
two
chinese
servants
in
long
silk
robes
and
hats
with
cocktails
and
zakouski
then
a
russian
princess
sailed
in
she
had
white
hair
and
a
black
silk
dress
up
to
her
neck
she
looked
like
the
heroine
of
a
play
by
victorien
sardou
who
had
outlived
the
melodramatic
fury
of
her
youth
and
now
did
crochet
she
was
infinitely
bored
when
you
spoke
to
her
of
tolstoi
or
chekov
but
grew
animated
when
she
talked
of
jack
london
she
put
a
question
to
the
maiden
lady
which
the
maiden
lady
though
no
longer
young
had
no
answer
for
why
she
asked
do
you
english
write
such
silly
books
about
russia
but
then
the
first
secretary
of
the
british
legation
appeared
he
gave
his
entrance
the
significance
of
an
event
he
was
very
tall
baldish
but
elegant
and
he
was
beautifully
dressed
he
looked
with
polite
astonishment
at
the
dazzling
orders
of
the
minister
of
guatemala
the
chargé
of
montenegro
who
flattered
himself
that
he
was
the
best
dressed
man
in
the
diplomatic
body
but
was
not
quite
sure
whether
the
first
secretary
of
the
british
legation
thought
him
so
fluttered
up
to
him
to
ask
his
candid
opinion
of
the
frilled
shirt
he
wore
the
englishman
placed
a
glass
in
his
eye
and
looked
at
it
for
a
moment
gravely
then
he
paid
the
other
a
devastating
compliment
everyone
had
come
by
now
but
the
wife
of
the
french
military
attaché
they
said
she
was
always
late
est
said
the
handsome
wife
of
the
swiss
banker
but
at
last
magnificently
indifferent
to
the
fact
that
she
had
kept
everyone
waiting
for
half
an
hour
she
swam
into
the
room
she
was
tall
on
her
outrageously
high
heels
extremely
thin
and
she
wore
a
dress
that
gave
you
the
impression
that
she
had
nothing
on
at
all
her
hair
was
bobbed
and
blonde
and
she
was
boldly
painted
she
looked
like
a
idea
of
patient
griselda
when
she
moved
the
air
was
heavy
with
exotic
odours
she
gave
the
minister
of
guatemala
a
jewelled
emaciated
hand
to
kiss
with
a
few
smiling
words
made
the
banker
wife
feel
passée
provincial
and
portly
flung
an
improper
jest
at
the
english
lady
whose
embarrassment
was
mitigated
by
the
knowledge
that
the
wife
of
the
french
military
attaché
was
bien
and
drank
three
cocktails
in
rapid
succession
dinner
was
served
the
conversation
varied
from
a
resonant
rolling
french
to
a
somewhat
halting
english
they
talked
of
this
minister
who
had
just
written
from
bucharest
or
lima
and
that
counsellor
wife
who
found
it
so
dull
in
christiania
or
so
expensive
in
washington
on
the
whole
it
made
little
difference
to
them
in
what
capital
they
found
themselves
for
they
did
precisely
the
same
things
in
constantinople
berne
stockholm
and
peking
entrenched
within
their
diplomatic
privileges
and
supported
by
a
lively
sense
of
their
social
consequence
they
dwelt
in
a
world
in
which
copernicus
had
never
existed
for
to
them
sun
and
stars
circled
obsequiously
round
this
earth
of
ours
and
they
were
its
centre
no
one
knew
why
the
english
lady
was
there
and
the
wife
of
the
swiss
director
said
privately
that
she
was
without
doubt
a
german
spy
but
she
was
an
authority
on
the
country
she
told
you
that
the
chinese
had
such
perfect
manners
and
you
really
should
have
known
the
empress
dowager
she
was
a
perfect
darling
you
knew
very
well
that
in
constantinople
she
would
have
assured
you
that
the
turks
were
such
perfect
gentlemen
and
the
sultana
fatima
was
a
perfect
dear
and
spoke
such
wonderful
french
homeless
she
was
at
home
wherever
her
country
had
a
diplomatic
representative
the
first
secretary
of
the
british
legation
thought
the
party
rather
mixed
he
spoke
french
more
like
a
frenchman
than
any
frenchman
who
ever
lived
he
was
a
man
of
taste
and
he
had
a
natural
aptitude
for
being
right
he
only
knew
the
right
people
and
only
read
the
right
books
he
admired
none
but
the
right
music
and
cared
for
none
but
the
right
pictures
he
bought
his
clothes
at
the
right
tailor
and
his
shirts
from
the
only
possible
haberdasher
you
listened
to
him
with
stupefaction
presently
you
wished
with
all
your
heart
that
he
would
confess
to
a
liking
for
something
just
a
little
vulgar
you
would
have
felt
more
at
your
ease
if
only
with
bold
idiosyncrasy
he
had
claimed
that
soul
was
a
work
of
art
or
a
masterpiece
but
his
taste
was
faultless
he
was
perfect
and
you
were
half
afraid
that
he
knew
it
for
in
repose
his
face
had
the
look
of
one
who
bears
an
intolerable
burden
and
then
you
discovered
that
he
wrote
you
breathed
again
ii
at
a
treaty
port
there
was
about
the
party
a
splendour
which
has
vanished
from
the
dinner
tables
of
england
the
mahogany
groaned
with
silver
in
the
middle
of
the
snowy
damask
cloth
was
a
centrepiece
of
yellow
silk
such
as
you
were
unwillingly
constrained
to
buy
in
the
bazaars
of
your
prim
youth
and
on
this
was
a
massive
épergne
tall
silver
vases
in
which
were
large
chrysanthemums
made
it
possible
to
catch
only
glimpses
of
the
persons
opposite
you
and
tall
silver
candlesticks
reared
their
proud
heads
two
by
two
down
the
length
of
the
table
each
course
was
served
with
its
appropriate
wine
sherry
with
the
soup
and
hock
with
the
fish
and
there
were
the
two
entrées
a
white
entrée
and
a
brown
entrée
which
the
careful
housekeeper
of
the
nineties
felt
were
essential
to
a
properly
arranged
dinner
perhaps
the
conversation
was
less
varied
than
the
courses
for
guests
and
hosts
had
seen
one
another
nearly
every
day
for
an
intolerable
number
of
years
and
each
topic
that
arose
was
seized
upon
desperately
only
to
be
exhausted
and
followed
by
a
formidable
silence
they
talked
of
racing
and
golf
and
shooting
they
would
have
thought
it
bad
form
to
touch
upon
the
abstract
and
there
were
no
politics
for
them
to
discuss
china
bored
them
all
they
did
not
want
to
speak
of
that
they
only
knew
just
so
much
about
it
as
was
necessary
to
their
business
and
they
looked
with
distrust
upon
any
man
who
studied
the
chinese
language
why
should
he
unless
he
were
a
missionary
or
a
chinese
secretary
at
the
legation
you
could
hire
an
interpreter
for
dollars
a
month
and
it
was
well
known
that
all
those
fellows
who
went
in
for
chinese
grew
queer
in
the
head
they
were
all
persons
of
consequence
there
was
number
one
at
jardine
with
his
wife
and
the
manager
of
the
and
shanghai
bank
with
his
wife
the
man
and
his
wife
and
the
man
with
his
wife
and
the
s
man
with
his
wife
they
wore
their
evening
clothes
a
little
uneasily
as
though
they
wore
them
from
a
sense
of
duty
to
their
country
rather
than
as
a
comfortable
change
from
day
dress
they
had
come
to
the
party
because
they
had
nothing
else
in
the
world
to
do
but
when
the
moment
came
that
they
could
decently
take
their
leave
they
would
go
with
a
sigh
of
relief
they
were
bored
to
death
with
one
another

the

it

on

were
inscribed

words

he
offered
incense

and

and

knelt
and
knocked
his

marble
pavement
nine
times

at
the
very
spot
where
the
of

knelt

wrote
his
name
in
a
fine
bold
hand
and
the
town
and
state
he
came
from
hastings
nebraska
so
he
sought
to
attach
his
fleeting
personality
to
the
recollection
of
that
grandeur
of
which
some
dim
rumour
had
reached
him
he
thought
that
so
men
would
remember
him
when
he
was
no
more
he
aimed
in
this
crude
way
at
immortality
but
vain
are
the
hopes
of
men
for
no
sooner
had
he
sauntered
down
the
steps
than
a
chinese
caretaker
who
had
been
leaning
against
the
balustrade
idly
looking
at
the
blue
sky
came
forward
spat
neatly
on
the
spot
where
willard
untermeyer
had
written
and
with
his
foot
smeared
his
spittle
over
the
name
in
a
moment
no
trace
remained
that
willard
untermeyer
had
ever
visited
that
place
viii
the
servants
of
god
they
were
sitting
side
by
side
two
missionaries
talking
to
one
another
of
perfectly
trivial
things
in
the
way
people
talk
who
wish
to
show
each
other
civility
but
have
nothing
in
common
and
they
would
have
been
surprised
to
be
told
that
they
had
certainly
one
admirable
thing
in
common
goodness
for
both
had
this
also
in
common
humility
though
perhaps
in
the
englishman
it
was
more
deliberate
and
so
if
more
conspicuous
less
natural
than
it
was
in
the
frenchman
otherwise
the
contrasts
between
them
were
almost
ludicrous
the
frenchman
was
hard
on
eighty
a
tall
man
still
unbent
and
his
large
bones
suggested
that
in
youth
he
had
been
a
man
of
uncommon
strength
now
his
only
sign
of
power
lay
in
his
eyes
immensely
large
so
that
you
could
not
help
noticing
their
strange
expression
and
flashing
that
is
an
epithet
often
applied
to
eyes
but
i
do
not
think
i
have
ever
seen
any
to
which
it
might
be
applied
so
fitly
there
was
really
a
flame
in
them
and
they
seemed
to
emit
light
they
had
a
wildness
which
hardly
suggested
sanity
they
were
the
eyes
of
a
prophet
in
israel
his
nose
was
large
and
aggressive
his
chin
was
firm
and
square
at
no
time
could
he
have
been
a
man
to
trifle
with
but
in
his
prime
he
must
have
been
terrific
perhaps
the
passion
of
his
eyes
bespoke
battles
long
fought
out
in
the
uttermost
depths
of
his
heart
and
his
soul
cried
out
in
them
vanquished
and
bleeding
yet
triumphant
and
he
exulted
in
the
unclosed
wound
which
he
offered
in
willing
sacrifice
to
almighty
god
he
felt
the
cold
in
his
old
bones
and
he
wore
wrapped
about
him
like
a
soldier
cloak
a
great
fur
and
on
his
head
a
cap
of
chinese
sable
he
was
a
magnificent
figure
he
had
been
in
china
for
half
a
century
and
thrice
he
had
fled
for
his
life
when
the
chinese
had
attacked
his
mission
i
trust
they
wo
attack
it
again
he
said
smiling
for
i
am
too
old
now
to
make
these
precipitate
journeys
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
serai
he
lit
a
long
black
cigar
and
puffed
it
with
great
enjoyment
the
other
was
very
much
younger
he
could
not
have
been
more
than
fifty
and
he
had
not
been
in
china
for
more
than
twenty
years
he
was
a
member
of
the
english
church
mission
and
he
was
dressed
in
a
grey
tweed
suit
and
a
spotted
tie
he
sought
to
look
as
little
like
a
clergyman
as
possible
he
was
a
little
taller
than
the
average
but
he
was
so
fat
that
he
looked
stumpy
he
had
a
round
face
with
red
cheeks
and
a
grey
moustache
of
the
variety
known
as
toothbrush
he
was
very
bald
but
with
a
pardonable
and
touching
vanity
he
had
grown
his
hair
long
enough
on
one
side
to
be
brought
over
the
scalp
and
so
give
himself
at
all
events
the
illusion
that
his
head
was
he
was
a
jovial
fellow
with
a
hearty
laugh
and
it
rang
out
loudly
honest
and
true
when
he
chaffed
his
friends
or
was
chaffed
by
them
he
had
the
humour
of
a
schoolboy
and
you
could
imagine
him
shaking
in
all
his
bulk
when
someone
slipped
on
a
piece
of
orange
peel
but
the
laughter
would
be
stopped
and
he
would
redden
as
it
struck
him
suddenly
that
the
man
who
slipped
might
have
hurt
himself
and
then
he
would
be
all
kindness
and
sympathy
for
it
was
impossible
to
be
with
him
for
ten
minutes
without
realising
the
tenderness
of
his
heart
you
felt
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
ask
him
to
do
anything
he
would
not
gladly
do
and
if
perhaps
at
first
his
heartiness
would
make
it
difficult
to
go
to
him
in
your
spiritual
needs
you
could
be
sure
in
all
practical
affairs
of
his
attention
sympathy
and
good
sense
he
was
a
man
whose
purse
was
always
open
to
the
indigent
and
whose
time
was
always
at
the
service
of
those
who
wanted
it
and
yet
perhaps
it
is
unjust
to
say
that
in
the
affairs
of
the
soul
his
help
would
not
be
very
effectual
for
though
he
could
not
speak
to
you
like
the
old
frenchman
with
the
authority
of
a
church
that
has
never
admitted
doubt
or
with
the
compelling
fire
of
the
ascetic
he
would
share
your
distress
with
such
a
candid
sympathy
consoling
you
with
his
own
hesitations
less
a
minister
of
god
then
than
a
halting
tremulous
man
of
the
same
flesh
as
yourself
who
sought
to
share
with
you
the
hope
and
the
consolation
with
which
his
own
soul
was
refreshed
that
perhaps
in
his
own
way
he
had
something
as
good
to
offer
as
the
other
his
story
was
a
little
unusual
he
had
been
a
soldier
and
he
was
pleased
to
talk
of
the
old
days
when
he
had
hunted
with
the
quorn
and
danced
through
the
london
season
he
had
no
unhealthy
feeling
of
past
sin
i
was
a
great
dancer
in
my
young
days
he
said
but
i
expect
i
should
be
quite
out
of
it
now
with
all
these
new
dances
it
was
a
good
life
so
long
as
it
lasted
and
though
he
did
not
for
a
moment
regret
it
he
had
no
feeling
of
resentment
for
it
the
call
had
come
when
he
was
in
india
he
did
not
exactly
know
how
or
why
it
had
just
come
a
sudden
feeling
that
he
must
give
up
his
life
to
bringing
the
heathen
to
the
belief
in
christ
but
it
was
a
feeling
that
he
could
not
resist
it
gave
him
no
peace
he
was
a
happy
man
now
enjoying
his
work
it
a
slow
business
he
said
but
i
see
signs
of
progress
and
i
love
the
chinese
i
would
change
my
life
here
for
any
in
the
world
the
two
missionaries
said
to
one
another
when
are
you
going
home
asked
the
englishman
oh
in
a
day
or
two
i
may
not
see
you
again
then
i
expect
to
go
home
in
march
but
one
meant
the
little
town
with
its
narrow
streets
where
he
had
lived
for
fifty
years
since
when
he
left
france
a
young
man
he
left
it
for
ever
but
the
other
meant
the
elizabethan
house
in
cheshire
with
its
smooth
lawns
and
its
oak
trees
where
his
ancestors
had
dwelt
for
three
centuries
ix
the
inn
it
seems
long
since
the
night
fell
and
for
an
hour
a
coolie
has
walked
before
your
chair
carrying
a
lantern
it
throws
a
thin
circle
of
light
in
front
of
you
and
as
you
pass
you
catch
a
pale
glimpse
like
a
thing
of
beauty
emerging
vaguely
from
the
ceaseless
flux
of
common
life
of
a
bamboo
thicket
a
flash
of
water
in
a
rice
field
or
the
heavy
darkness
of
a
banyan
now
and
then
a
belated
peasant
bearing
two
heavy
baskets
on
his
yoke
sidles
by
the
bearers
walk
more
slowly
but
after
the
long
day
they
have
lost
none
of
their
spirit
and
they
chatter
gaily
they
laugh
and
one
of
them
breaks
into
a
fragment
of
tuneless
song
but
the
causeway
rises
and
the
lantern
throws
its
light
suddenly
on
a
whitewashed
wall
you
have
reached
the
first
miserable
houses
that
straggle
along
the
path
outside
the
city
wall
and
two
or
three
minutes
more
bring
you
to
a
steep
flight
of
steps
the
bearers
take
them
at
a
run
you
pass
through
the
city
gates
the
narrow
streets
are
multitudinous
and
in
the
shops
they
are
busy
still
the
bearers
shout
raucously
the
crowd
divides
and
you
pass
through
a
double
hedge
of
serried
curious
people
their
faces
are
impassive
and
their
dark
eyes
stare
mysteriously
the
bearers
their
day
work
done
march
with
a
swinging
stride
suddenly
they
stop
wheel
to
the
right
into
a
courtyard
and
you
have
reached
the
inn
your
chair
is
set
down
the
inn
it
consists
of
a
long
yard
partly
covered
with
rooms
opening
on
it
on
each
side
is
lit
by
three
or
four
oil
lamps
they
throw
a
dim
light
immediately
around
them
but
make
the
surrounding
darkness
more
impenetrable
all
the
front
of
the
yard
is
crowded
with
tables
and
at
these
people
are
packed
eating
rice
or
drinking
tea
some
of
them
play
games
you
do
not
know
at
the
great
stove
where
water
in
a
cauldron
is
perpetually
heating
and
rice
in
a
huge
pan
being
prepared
stand
the
persons
of
the
inn
they
serve
out
rapidly
great
bowls
of
rice
and
fill
the
teapots
which
are
incessantly
brought
them
further
back
a
couple
of
naked
coolies
sturdy
thickset
and
supple
are
sluicing
themselves
with
boiling
water
you
walk
to
the
end
of
the
yard
where
facing
the
entrance
but
protected
from
the
vulgar
gaze
by
a
screen
is
the
principal
guest
chamber
it
is
a
spacious
windowless
room
with
a
floor
of
trodden
earth
lofty
for
it
goes
the
whole
height
of
the
inn
with
an
open
roof
the
walls
are
whitewashed
showing
the
beams
so
that
they
remind
you
of
a
farmhouse
in
sussex
the
furniture
consists
of
a
square
table
with
a
couple
of
wooden
and
three
or
four
wooden
pallets
covered
with
matting
on
the
least
dirty
of
which
you
will
presently
lay
your
bed
in
a
cup
of
oil
a
taper
gives
a
tiny
point
of
light
they
bring
you
your
lantern
and
you
wait
while
your
dinner
is
cooked
the
bearers
are
merry
now
that
they
have
set
down
their
loads
they
wash
their
feet
and
put
on
clean
sandals
and
smoke
their
long
pipes
how
precious
then
is
the
inordinate
length
of
your
book
for
you
are
travelling
light
and
you
have
limited
yourself
to
three
and
how
jealously
you
read
every
word
of
every
page
so
that
you
may
delay
as
long
as
possible
the
dreaded
moment
when
you
must
reach
the
end
you
are
mightily
thankful
then
to
the
authors
of
long
books
and
when
you
turn
over
their
pages
reckoning
how
long
you
can
make
them
last
you
wish
they
were
half
as
long
again
you
do
not
ask
then
for
the
perfect
lucidity
which
he
who
runs
may
read
a
complicated
phraseology
which
makes
it
needful
to
read
the
sentence
a
second
time
to
get
its
meaning
is
not
unwelcome
a
profusion
of
metaphor
giving
your
fancy
ample
play
a
richness
of
allusion
affording
you
the
delight
of
recognition
are
then
qualities
beyond
price
then
if
the
thought
is
elaborate
without
being
profound
for
you
have
been
on
the
road
since
dawn
and
of
the
forty
miles
of
the
day
journey
you
have
footed
it
more
than
half
you
have
the
perfect
book
for
the
occasion
but
the
noise
in
the
inn
suddenly
increases
to
a
din
and
looking
out
you
see
that
more
travellers
a
party
of
chinese
in
sedan
chairs
have
arrived
they
take
the
rooms
on
each
side
of
you
and
through
the
thin
walls
you
hear
their
loud
talking
far
into
the
night
with
a
lazy
restful
eye
your
whole
body
conscious
of
the
enjoyment
of
lying
in
bed
taking
a
sensual
pleasure
in
its
fatigue
you
follow
the
elaborate
pattern
of
the
transom
the
dim
lamp
in
the
yard
shines
through
the
torn
paper
with
which
it
is
covered
and
its
intricate
design
is
black
against
the
light
at
last
everything
is
quiet
but
for
a
man
in
the
next
room
who
is
coughing
painfully
it
is
the
peculiar
repeated
cough
of
phthisis
and
hearing
it
at
intervals
through
the
night
you
wonder
how
long
the
poor
devil
can
live
you
rejoice
in
your
own
rude
strength
then
a
cock
crows
loudly
just
behind
your
head
it
seems
and
not
far
away
a
bugler
blows
a
long
blast
on
his
bugle
a
melancholy
wail
the
inn
begins
to
stir
again
lights
are
lit
and
the
coolies
make
ready
their
loads
for
another
day
x
the
glory
hole
it
is
a
sort
of
little
cubicle
in
a
corner
of
the
chandler
store
just
under
the
ceiling
and
you
reach
it
by
a
stair
which
is
like
a
ship
companion
it
is
partitioned
off
from
the
shop
by
matchboarding
about
four
feet
high
so
that
when
you
sit
on
the
wooden
benches
that
surround
the
table
you
can
see
into
the
shop
with
all
its
stores
here
are
coils
of
rope
oilskins
heavy
hurricane
lamps
hams
tinned
goods
liquor
of
all
sorts
curios
to
take
home
to
your
wife
and
children
clothes
i
know
not
what
there
is
everything
that
a
foreign
ship
can
want
in
an
eastern
port
you
can
watch
the
chinese
salesmen
and
customers
and
they
have
a
pleasantly
mysterious
air
as
though
they
were
concerned
in
nefarious
business
you
can
see
who
comes
into
the
shop
and
since
it
is
certainly
a
friend
bid
him
join
you
in
the
glory
hole
through
the
wide
doorway
you
see
the
sun
beating
down
on
the
stone
pavement
of
the
roadway
and
the
coolies
scurrying
past
with
their
heavy
loads
at
about
midday
the
company
begins
to
assemble
two
or
three
pilots
captain
thompson
and
captain
brown
old
men
who
have
sailed
the
china
seas
for
thirty
years
and
now
have
a
comfortable
billet
ashore
the
skipper
of
a
tramp
from
shanghai
and
the
taipans
of
one
or
two
tea
firms
the
boy
stands
silently
waiting
for
orders
and
he
brings
the
drinks
and
the
talk
flows
rather
prosily
at
first
a
boat
was
wrecked
the
other
day
going
in
to
foochow
that
fellow
maclean
the
engineer
of
the
has
made
a
pot
of
money
in
rubber
lately
the
consul
wife
is
coming
out
from
home
in
the
but
by
the
time
the
has
travelled
round
the
table
and
the
loser
has
signed
the
chit
the
glasses
are
empty
and
the
is
reached
for
once
more
the
boy
brings
the
second
round
of
drinks
then
the
tongues
of
these
stolid
stubborn
men
are
loosened
a
little
and
they
begin
to
talk
of
the
past
one
of
the
pilots
knew
the
port
first
hard
on
fifty
years
ago
ah
those
were
the
great
days
that
when
you
ought
to
have
seen
the
glory
hole
he
says
with
a
smile
those
were
the
days
of
the
tea
clippers
when
there
would
be
thirty
or
forty
ships
in
the
harbour
waiting
for
their
cargo
everyone
had
plenty
of
money
to
spend
then
and
the
glory
hole
was
the
centre
of
life
in
the
port
if
you
wanted
to
find
a
man
why
you
came
to
the
glory
hole
and
if
he
was
there
he
be
sure
to
come
along
soon
the
agents
did
their
business
with
the
skippers
there
and
the
doctor
did
have
office
hours
he
went
to
the
glory
hole
at
noon
and
if
anyone
was
sick
he
attended
to
him
there
and
then
those
were
the
days
when
men
knew
how
to
drink
they
would
come
at
midday
and
drink
all
through
the
afternoon
a
boy
bringing
them
a
bite
if
they
were
hungry
and
drink
all
through
the
night
fortunes
were
lost
and
won
in
the
glory
hole
for
they
were
gamblers
then
and
a
man
would
risk
all
the
profits
of
his
run
in
a
game
of
cards
those
were
the
good
old
days
but
now
the
trade
was
gone
the
tea
clippers
no
longer
thronged
the
harbour
the
port
was
dead
and
the
young
men
the
young
men
of
the
or
of
jardine
turned
up
their
noses
at
the
glory
hole
and
as
the
old
pilot
talked
that
dingy
little
cubicle
with
its
stained
table
seemed
to
be
for
a
moment
peopled
with
those
old
skippers
hardy
reckless
and
adventurous
of
a
day
that
has
gone
for
ever
xi
fear
i
was
staying
a
night
with
him
on
the
road
the
mission
stood
on
a
little
hill
just
outside
the
gates
of
a
populous
city
the
first
thing
i
noticed
about
him
was
the
difference
of
his
taste
the
house
as
a
rule
is
furnished
in
a
style
which
is
almost
an
outrage
to
decency
the
parlour
with
its
air
of
an
unused
room
is
papered
with
a
gaudy
paper
and
on
the
wall
hang
texts
engravings
of
sentimental
pictures
soul
and
luke
filde
or
if
the
missionary
has
been
long
in
the
country
congratulatory
scrolls
on
stiff
red
paper
there
is
a
brussels
carpet
on
the
floor
rocking
chairs
if
the
household
is
american
and
a
stiff
on
each
side
of
the
fireplace
if
it
is
english
there
is
a
sofa
which
is
so
placed
that
nobody
sits
on
it
and
by
the
grim
look
of
it
few
can
want
to
there
are
lace
curtains
on
the
windows
here
and
there
are
occasional
tables
on
which
are
photographs
and
with
modern
porcelain
on
them
the
has
an
appearance
of
more
use
but
almost
the
whole
of
it
is
taken
up
by
a
large
table
and
when
you
sit
at
it
you
are
crowded
into
the
fireplace
but
in
wingrove
study
there
were
books
from
floor
to
ceiling
a
table
littered
with
papers
curtains
of
a
rich
green
stuff
and
over
the
fireplace
a
tibetan
banner
there
was
a
row
of
tibetan
buddhas
on
the
chimney
piece
i
do
know
how
it
is
but
you
got
just
the
feeling
of
college
rooms
about
the
place
i
said
do
you
think
so
he
answered
i
was
a
tutor
at
oriel
for
some
time
he
was
a
man
of
nearly
fifty
i
should
think
tall
and
though
not
stout
with
grey
hair
cut
very
short
and
a
reddish
face
one
imagined
that
he
must
be
a
jovial
man
fond
of
laughter
an
easy
talker
and
a
good
fellow
but
his
eyes
disconcerted
you
they
were
grave
and
unsmiling
they
had
a
look
that
i
could
only
describe
as
harassed
i
wondered
if
i
had
fallen
upon
him
at
an
inconvenient
moment
when
his
mind
was
taken
up
with
irksome
matters
yet
somehow
i
felt
that
this
was
not
a
passing
expression
but
a
settled
one
rather
and
i
could
not
understand
it
he
had
just
that
look
of
anxiety
which
you
see
in
certain
forms
of
heart
disease
he
chatted
about
one
thing
and
another
then
he
said
i
hear
my
wife
come
in
shall
we
go
into
the
he
led
me
in
and
introduced
me
to
a
little
thin
woman
with
spectacles
and
a
shy
manner
it
was
plain
that
she
belonged
to
a
different
class
from
her
husband
the
missionaries
for
the
most
part
with
all
manner
of
virtues
have
not
those
which
we
can
find
no
better
way
to
describe
than
under
the
category
of
good
breeding
they
may
be
saints
but
they
are
not
often
gentlemen
now
it
struck
me
that
wingrove
was
a
gentleman
for
it
was
evident
that
his
wife
was
not
a
lady
she
had
a
vulgar
intonation
the
was
furnished
in
a
way
i
had
never
before
seen
in
a
missionary
house
there
was
a
chinese
carpet
on
the
floor
chinese
pictures
old
ones
hung
on
the
yellow
walls
two
or
three
ming
tiles
gave
a
dash
of
colour
in
the
middle
of
the
room
was
a
blackwood
table
elaborately
carved
and
on
it
was
a
figure
in
white
porcelain
i
made
a
trivial
remark
i
do
much
care
for
all
these
chinese
things
meself
answered
my
hostess
briskly
but
wingrove
set
on
them
i
clear
them
all
out
if
i
had
my
way
i
laughed
not
because
i
was
amused
and
then
i
caught
in
wingrove
eyes
a
flash
of
icy
hatred
i
was
astonished
but
it
passed
in
a
moment
we
wo
have
them
if
you
do
like
them
my
dear
he
said
gently
they
can
be
put
away
oh
i
do
mind
them
if
they
please
you
we
began
to
talk
about
my
journey
and
in
the
course
of
conversation
i
happened
to
ask
wingrove
how
long
it
was
since
he
had
been
in
england
seventeen
years
he
said
i
was
surprised
but
i
thought
you
had
one
year
furlough
every
seven
yes
but
i
have
cared
to
go
wingrove
thinks
it
bad
for
the
work
to
go
away
for
a
year
like
that
explained
his
wife
of
course
i
do
care
to
go
without
him
i
wondered
how
it
was
that
he
had
ever
come
to
china
the
actual
details
of
the
call
fascinate
me
and
often
enough
you
find
people
who
are
willing
to
talk
of
it
though
you
have
to
form
your
own
opinion
on
the
matter
less
from
the
words
they
say
than
from
the
implications
of
them
but
i
did
not
feel
that
wingrove
was
a
man
who
would
be
induced
either
directly
or
indirectly
to
speak
of
that
intimate
experience
he
evidently
took
his
work
very
seriously
are
there
other
foreigners
here
i
asked
no
it
must
be
very
lonely
i
said
i
think
i
prefer
it
so
he
answered
looking
at
one
of
the
pictures
on
the
wall
they
only
be
business
people
and
you
know
he
smiled
they
have
much
use
for
missionaries
and
they
not
so
intellectual
that
it
is
a
great
hardship
to
be
deprived
of
their
company
and
of
course
we
not
really
alone
you
know
said
wingrove
we
have
two
evangelists
and
then
there
are
two
young
ladies
who
teach
and
there
are
the
school
children
tea
was
brought
in
and
we
gossiped
desultorily
wingrove
seemed
to
speak
with
effort
and
i
had
increasingly
that
feeling
in
him
of
perturbed
repression
he
had
pleasing
manners
and
was
certainly
trying
to
be
cordial
and
yet
i
had
a
sense
of
effort
i
led
the
conversation
to
oxford
mentioning
various
friends
whom
he
might
know
but
he
gave
me
no
encouragement
it
so
long
since
i
left
home
he
said
and
i
have
kept
up
with
anyone
there
a
great
deal
of
work
in
a
mission
like
this
and
it
absorbs
one
entirely
i
thought
he
was
exaggerating
a
little
so
i
remarked
well
by
the
number
of
books
you
have
i
take
it
that
you
get
a
certain
amount
of
time
for
reading
i
very
seldom
read
he
answered
with
abruptness
in
a
voice
that
i
knew
already
was
not
quite
his
own
i
was
puzzled
there
was
something
odd
about
the
man
at
last
as
was
inevitable
i
suppose
he
began
to
talk
of
the
chinese
wingrove
said
the
same
things
about
them
that
i
had
already
heard
so
many
missionaries
say
they
were
a
lying
people
untrustworthy
cruel
and
dirty
but
a
faint
light
was
visible
in
the
east
though
the
results
of
missionary
endeavour
were
not
very
noteworthy
as
yet
the
future
was
promising
they
no
longer
believed
in
their
old
gods
and
the
power
of
the
literati
was
broken
it
is
an
attitude
of
mistrust
and
dislike
tempered
by
optimism
but
wingrove
mitigated
his
wife
strictures
he
dwelt
on
the
of
the
chinese
on
their
devotion
to
their
parents
and
on
their
love
for
their
children
wingrove
wo
hear
a
word
against
the
chinese
said
his
wife
he
simply
loves
them
i
think
they
have
great
qualities
he
said
you
ca
walk
through
those
crowded
streets
of
theirs
without
having
that
impressed
on
you
i
do
believe
wingrove
notices
the
smells
his
wife
laughed
at
that
moment
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
a
young
woman
came
in
she
had
the
long
skirts
and
the
unbound
feet
of
the
native
christian
and
on
her
face
a
look
that
was
at
once
cringing
and
sullen
she
said
something
to
wingrove
i
happened
to
catch
sight
of
face
when
he
saw
her
there
passed
over
it
an
expression
of
the
most
intense
physical
repulsion
it
was
distorted
as
though
by
an
odour
that
nauseated
him
and
then
immediately
it
vanished
and
his
lips
twitched
to
a
pleasant
smile
but
the
effort
was
too
great
and
he
showed
only
a
tortured
grimace
i
looked
at
him
with
amazement
wingrove
with
an
excuse
me
got
up
and
left
the
room
that
is
one
of
our
teachers
said
wingrove
in
that
same
set
voice
which
had
a
little
puzzled
me
before
she
invaluable
i
put
infinite
reliance
on
her
she
has
a
very
fine
character
then
i
hardly
know
why
in
a
flash
i
saw
the
truth
i
saw
the
disgust
in
his
soul
for
all
that
his
will
loved
i
was
filled
with
the
excitement
which
an
explorer
may
feel
when
after
a
hazardous
journey
he
comes
upon
a
country
with
features
new
and
unexpected
those
tortured
eyes
explained
themselves
the
unnatural
voice
the
measured
restraint
with
which
he
praised
that
air
he
had
of
a
hunted
man
notwithstanding
all
he
said
he
hated
the
chinese
with
a
hatred
beside
which
his
distaste
was
insignificant
when
he
walked
through
the
teeming
streets
of
the
city
it
was
an
agony
to
him
his
missionary
life
revolted
him
his
soul
was
like
the
raw
shoulders
of
the
coolies
and
the
carrying
pole
burnt
the
bleeding
wound
he
would
not
go
home
because
he
could
not
bear
to
see
again
what
he
cared
for
so
much
he
would
not
read
his
books
because
they
reminded
him
of
the
life
he
loved
so
passionately
and
perhaps
he
had
married
that
vulgar
wife
in
order
to
cut
himself
off
more
resolutely
from
a
world
that
his
every
instinct
craved
for
he
martyred
his
tortured
soul
with
a
passionate
exasperation
i
tried
to
see
how
the
call
had
come
i
think
that
for
years
he
had
been
completely
happy
in
his
easy
ways
at
oxford
and
he
had
loved
his
work
with
its
pleasant
companionship
his
books
his
holidays
in
france
and
italy
he
was
a
contented
man
and
asked
nothing
better
than
to
spend
the
rest
of
his
days
in
just
such
a
fashion
but
i
know
not
what
obscure
feeling
had
gradually
taken
hold
of
him
that
his
life
was
too
lazy
too
contented
i
think
he
was
always
a
religious
man
and
perhaps
some
early
belief
instilled
into
him
in
childhood
and
long
forgotten
of
a
jealous
god
who
hated
his
creatures
to
be
happy
on
earth
rankled
in
the
depths
of
his
heart
i
think
because
he
was
so
well
satisfied
with
his
life
he
began
to
think
it
was
sinful
a
restless
anxiety
seized
him
whatever
he
thought
with
his
intelligence
his
instincts
began
to
tremble
with
the
dread
of
eternal
punishment
i
do
not
know
what
put
the
idea
of
china
into
his
head
but
at
first
he
must
have
thrust
it
aside
with
violent
repulsion
and
perhaps
the
very
violence
of
his
repulsion
impressed
the
idea
on
him
for
he
found
it
haunting
him
i
think
he
said
that
he
would
not
go
but
i
think
he
felt
that
he
would
have
to
god
was
pursuing
him
and
wherever
he
hid
himself
god
followed
with
his
reason
he
struggled
but
with
his
heart
he
was
caught
he
could
not
help
himself
at
least
he
gave
in
i
knew
i
should
never
see
him
again
and
i
had
not
the
time
to
spend
on
the
commonplaces
of
conversation
before
a
reasonable
familiarity
would
permit
me
to
talk
of
more
intimate
matters
i
seized
the
opportunity
while
we
were
still
alone
tell
me
i
said
do
you
believe
god
will
condemn
the
chinese
to
eternal
punishment
if
they
do
accept
christianity
i
am
sure
my
question
was
crude
and
tactless
for
the
old
man
in
him
tightened
his
lips
but
nevertheless
he
answered
the
whole
teaching
of
the
gospel
forces
one
to
that
conclusion
there
is
not
a
single
argument
which
people
have
adduced
to
the
contrary
which
has
the
force
of
the
plain
words
of
jesus
christ
xii
the
picture
i
do
not
know
whether
he
was
a
mandarin
bound
for
the
capital
of
the
province
or
some
student
travelling
to
a
seat
of
learning
nor
what
the
reason
that
delayed
him
in
the
most
miserable
of
all
the
miserable
inns
in
china
perhaps
one
or
other
of
his
bearers
hidden
somewhere
to
smoke
a
pipe
of
opium
for
it
is
cheap
in
that
neighborhood
and
you
must
be
prepared
for
trouble
with
your
coolies
could
not
be
found
perhaps
a
storm
of
torrential
rain
had
held
him
for
an
hour
an
unwilling
prisoner
the
room
was
so
low
that
you
could
easily
touch
the
rafters
with
your
hand
the
mud
walls
were
covered
with
dirty
whitewash
here
and
there
worn
away
and
all
round
on
wooden
pallets
were
straw
beds
for
the
coolies
who
were
the
inn
habitual
guests
the
sun
alone
enabled
you
to
support
the
melancholy
squalor
it
shone
through
the
latticed
window
a
beam
of
golden
light
and
threw
on
the
trodden
earth
of
the
floor
a
pattern
of
an
intricate
and
splendid
richness
and
here
to
pass
an
idle
moment
he
had
taken
his
stone
tablet
and
mixing
a
little
water
with
the
stick
of
ink
which
he
rubbed
on
it
seized
the
fine
brush
with
which
he
executed
the
beautiful
characters
of
the
chinese
writing
he
was
surely
proud
of
his
exquisite
calligraphy
and
it
was
a
welcome
gift
which
he
made
his
friends
when
he
sent
them
a
scroll
on
which
was
written
a
maxim
glitteringly
compact
of
the
divine
confucius
and
with
a
bold
hand
he
drew
on
the
wall
a
branch
of
and
a
bird
perched
on
it
it
was
done
very
lightly
but
with
an
admirable
ease
i
know
not
what
happy
chance
guided
the
artist
touch
for
the
bird
was
all
with
life
and
the
were
tremulous
on
their
stalks
the
soft
airs
of
spring
blew
through
the
sketch
into
that
sordid
chamber
and
for
the
beating
of
a
pulse
you
were
in
touch
with
the
eternal
xiii
her
britannic
majesty
representative
he
was
a
man
of
less
than
middle
height
with
stiff
brown
hair
a
little
toothbrush
moustache
and
glasses
through
which
his
blue
eyes
looking
at
you
aggressively
were
somewhat
distorted
there
was
a
defiant
perkiness
in
his
appearance
which
reminded
you
of
the
and
as
he
asked
you
to
sit
down
and
inquired
your
business
meanwhile
sorting
the
papers
littered
on
his
desk
as
though
you
had
disturbed
him
in
the
midst
of
important
affairs
you
had
the
feeling
that
he
was
on
the
look
out
for
an
opportunity
to
put
you
in
your
place
he
had
cultivated
the
official
manner
to
perfection
you
were
the
public
an
unavoidable
nuisance
and
the
only
justification
for
your
existence
was
that
you
did
what
you
were
told
without
argument
or
delay
but
even
officials
have
their
weakness
and
somehow
it
chanced
that
he
found
it
very
difficult
to
bring
any
business
to
an
end
without
confiding
his
grievance
to
you
it
appeared
that
people
missionaries
especially
thought
him
supercilious
and
domineering
he
assured
you
that
he
thought
there
was
a
great
deal
of
good
in
missionaries
it
is
true
that
many
of
them
were
ignorant
and
unreasonable
and
he
like
their
attitude
in
his
district
most
of
them
were
canadians
and
personally
he
did
like
canadians
but
as
for
saying
that
he
put
on
airs
of
superiority
he
fixed
his
more
firmly
on
his
nose
it
was
monstrously
untrue
on
the
contrary
he
went
out
of
his
way
to
help
them
but
it
was
only
natural
that
he
should
help
them
in
his
way
rather
than
in
theirs
it
was
hard
to
listen
to
him
without
a
smile
for
in
every
word
he
said
you
felt
how
exasperating
he
must
be
to
the
unfortunate
persons
over
whom
he
had
control
his
manner
was
deplorable
he
had
developed
the
gift
of
putting
up
your
back
to
a
degree
which
is
very
seldom
met
with
he
was
in
short
a
vain
irritable
bumptious
and
tiresome
little
man
during
the
revolution
while
a
lot
of
firing
was
going
on
in
the
city
between
the
rival
factions
he
had
occasion
to
go
to
the
southern
general
on
official
business
connected
with
the
safety
of
his
nationals
and
on
his
way
through
the
yamen
he
came
across
three
prisoners
being
led
out
to
execution
he
stopped
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
firing
party
and
finding
out
what
was
about
to
happen
vehemently
protested
these
were
prisoners
of
war
and
it
was
barbarity
to
kill
them
the
officer
very
rudely
in
the
consul
words
told
him
that
he
must
carry
out
his
orders
the
consul
fired
up
he
was
going
to
let
a
confounded
chinese
officer
talk
to
him
in
that
way
an
altercation
ensued
the
general
informed
of
what
was
occurring
sent
out
to
ask
the
consul
to
come
in
to
him
but
the
consul
refused
to
move
till
the
prisoners
three
wretched
coolies
green
with
fear
were
handed
over
to
his
the
officer
waved
him
aside
and
ordered
his
firing
squad
to
take
aim
then
the
consul
i
can
see
him
fixing
his
glasses
on
his
nose
and
his
hair
bristling
fiercely
then
the
consul
stepped
forwards
between
the
levelled
rifles
and
the
three
miserable
men
and
told
the
soldiers
to
shoot
and
be
damned
there
was
hesitation
and
confusion
it
was
plain
that
the
rebels
did
not
want
to
shoot
a
british
consul
i
suppose
there
was
a
hurried
consultation
the
three
prisoners
were
given
over
to
him
and
in
triumph
the
little
man
marched
back
to
the
consulate
damn
it
sir
he
said
furiously
i
almost
thought
the
blighters
would
have
the
confounded
cheek
to
shoot
me
they
are
strange
people
the
british
if
their
manners
were
as
good
as
their
courage
is
great
they
would
merit
the
opinion
they
have
of
themselves
xiv
the
opium
den
on
the
stage
it
makes
a
very
effective
set
it
is
dimly
lit
the
room
is
low
and
squalid
in
one
corner
a
lamp
burns
mysteriously
before
a
hideous
image
and
incense
fills
the
theatre
with
its
exotic
scent
a
chinaman
wanders
to
and
fro
aloof
and
saturnine
while
on
wretched
pallets
lie
stupefied
the
victims
of
the
drug
now
and
then
one
of
them
breaks
into
frantic
raving
there
is
a
highly
dramatic
scene
where
some
poor
creature
unable
to
pay
for
the
satisfaction
of
his
craving
with
prayers
and
curses
begs
the
villainous
proprietor
for
a
pipe
to
still
his
anguish
i
have
read
also
in
novels
descriptions
which
made
my
blood
run
cold
and
when
i
was
taken
to
an
opium
den
by
a
eurasian
the
narrow
winding
stairway
up
which
he
led
me
prepared
me
sufficiently
to
receive
the
thrill
i
expected
i
was
introduced
into
a
neat
enough
room
brightly
lit
divided
into
cubicles
the
raised
floor
of
which
covered
with
clean
matting
formed
a
convenient
couch
in
one
an
elderly
gentleman
with
a
grey
head
and
very
beautiful
hands
was
quietly
reading
a
newspaper
with
his
long
pipe
by
his
side
in
another
two
coolies
were
lying
with
a
pipe
between
them
which
they
alternately
prepared
and
smoked
they
were
young
men
of
a
hearty
appearance
and
they
smiled
at
me
in
a
friendly
way
one
of
them
offered
me
a
smoke
in
a
third
four
men
squatted
over
a
and
a
little
further
on
a
man
was
dandling
a
baby
the
inscrutable
oriental
has
a
passion
for
children
while
the
mother
whom
i
took
to
be
the
landlord
wife
a
plump
woman
watched
him
with
a
broad
smile
on
her
lips
it
was
a
cheerful
spot
comfortable
and
cosy
it
reminded
me
somewhat
of
the
little
intimate
of
berlin
where
the
tired
working
man
could
go
in
the
evening
and
spend
a
peaceful
hour
fiction
is
stranger
than
fact
xv
the
last
chance
it
was
pathetically
obvious
that
she
had
come
to
china
to
be
married
and
what
made
it
almost
tragic
was
that
not
a
single
man
in
the
treaty
port
was
ignorant
of
the
fact
she
was
a
big
woman
with
an
ungainly
figure
her
hands
and
feet
were
large
she
had
a
large
nose
indeed
all
her
features
were
large
but
her
blue
eyes
were
fine
she
was
perhaps
a
little
too
conscious
of
them
she
was
a
blonde
and
she
was
thirty
in
the
daytime
when
she
wore
sensible
boots
a
short
skirt
and
a
slouch
hat
she
was
personable
but
in
the
evening
in
blue
silk
to
enhance
the
colour
of
her
eyes
in
a
frock
cut
by
heaven
knows
what
suburban
dressmaker
from
the
models
in
an
illustrated
paper
when
she
set
herself
out
to
be
alluring
she
was
an
object
that
made
you
horribly
she
wished
to
be
all
things
to
all
unmarried
men
she
listened
brightly
while
one
of
them
talked
of
shooting
and
she
listened
gaily
when
another
talked
of
the
freight
on
tea
she
clapped
her
hands
with
girlish
excitement
when
they
discussed
the
races
which
were
to
be
run
next
week
she
was
desperately
fond
of
dancing
with
a
young
american
and
she
made
him
promise
to
take
her
to
a
baseball
match
but
dancing
was
the
only
thing
she
cared
for
you
can
have
too
much
of
a
good
thing
and
with
the
elderly
but
single
taipan
of
an
important
firm
what
she
simply
loved
was
a
game
of
golf
she
was
willing
to
be
taught
billiards
by
a
young
man
who
had
lost
his
leg
in
the
war
and
she
gave
her
sprightly
attention
to
the
manager
of
a
bank
who
told
her
what
he
thought
of
silver
she
was
not
much
interested
in
the
chinese
for
that
was
a
subject
which
was
not
very
good
form
in
the
circles
in
which
she
found
herself
but
being
a
woman
she
could
not
help
being
revolted
at
the
way
in
which
chinese
women
were
treated
you
know
they
do
have
a
word
to
say
about
who
they
going
to
marry
she
explained
it
all
arranged
by
and
the
man
does
even
see
the
girl
till
he
married
her
there
no
romance
or
anything
like
that
and
as
far
as
love
goes
words
failed
her
she
was
a
thoroughly
creature
she
would
have
made
any
of
those
men
young
or
old
a
perfectly
good
wife
and
she
knew
it
xvi
the
nun
the
convent
lay
white
and
cool
among
the
trees
on
the
top
of
a
hill
and
as
i
stood
at
the
gateway
waiting
to
be
let
in
i
looked
down
at
the
tawny
river
glittering
in
the
sunlight
and
at
the
rugged
mountains
beyond
it
was
the
mother
superior
who
received
me
a
placid
lady
with
a
soft
voice
and
an
accent
which
told
me
that
she
came
from
the
south
of
france
she
showed
me
the
orphans
who
were
in
her
charge
busy
at
the
which
the
nuns
had
taught
them
smiling
shyly
and
she
showed
me
the
hospital
where
lay
soldiers
suffering
from
dysentery
typhoid
and
malaria
they
were
squalid
and
dirty
the
mother
superior
told
me
she
was
a
basque
the
mountains
that
she
looked
out
on
from
the
convent
windows
reminded
her
of
the
pyrenees
she
had
been
in
china
for
twenty
years
she
said
that
it
was
hard
sometimes
never
to
see
the
sea
here
on
the
great
river
they
were
a
thousand
miles
away
from
it
and
because
i
knew
the
country
where
she
was
born
she
talked
to
me
a
little
of
the
fine
roads
that
led
over
the
mountains
ah
they
did
not
have
them
here
in
china
and
the
vineyards
and
the
pleasant
villages
with
their
running
streams
that
nestled
at
the
foot
of
the
hills
but
the
chinese
were
good
people
the
orphans
were
very
quick
with
their
fingers
and
they
were
industrious
the
chinese
sought
them
as
wives
because
they
had
learnt
useful
things
in
the
convent
and
even
after
they
were
married
they
could
earn
a
little
money
by
their
needles
and
the
soldiers
too
they
were
not
so
bad
as
people
said
after
all
pauvres
they
did
not
want
to
be
soldiers
they
would
much
sooner
be
at
home
working
in
the
fields
those
whom
the
sisters
had
nursed
through
illness
were
not
devoid
of
gratitude
sometimes
when
they
were
coming
along
in
a
chair
and
overtook
two
nuns
who
had
been
in
the
town
to
buy
things
and
were
laden
with
parcels
they
would
offer
to
take
their
parcels
in
the
chair
they
were
not
bad
hearted
they
do
not
go
so
far
as
to
get
out
and
let
the
nuns
ride
in
their
stead
i
asked
a
nun
in
their
eyes
is
only
a
woman
she
smiled
indulgently
you
must
not
ask
from
people
more
than
they
are
capable
of
giving
how
true
and
yet
how
hard
to
remember
xvii
henderson
it
was
very
hard
to
look
at
him
without
a
chuckle
for
his
appearance
immediately
told
you
all
about
him
when
you
saw
him
at
the
club
reading
london
or
lounging
at
the
bar
with
a
gin
and
bitters
at
his
elbow
no
cocktails
for
him
his
unconventionality
attracted
your
attention
but
you
recognised
him
at
once
for
he
was
a
perfect
specimen
of
his
class
his
unconventionality
was
exquisitely
conventional
everything
about
him
was
according
to
standard
from
his
serviceable
boots
to
his
rather
long
untidy
hair
he
wore
a
loose
low
collar
that
showed
a
thick
neck
and
loose
somewhat
shabby
but
clothes
he
always
smoked
a
short
briar
pipe
he
was
very
humorous
on
the
subject
of
cigarettes
he
was
a
biggish
fellow
athletic
with
fine
eyes
and
a
pleasant
voice
he
talked
fluently
his
language
was
often
obscene
not
because
his
mind
was
impure
but
because
his
bent
was
democratic
as
you
guessed
by
the
look
of
him
he
drank
beer
not
in
fact
but
in
the
spirit
with
chesterton
and
walked
the
sussex
downs
with
hilaire
belloc
he
had
played
football
at
oxford
but
with
wells
he
despised
the
ancient
seat
of
learning
he
looked
upon
bernard
shaw
as
a
little
out
of
date
but
he
had
still
great
hopes
of
granville
barker
he
had
had
many
serious
talks
with
and
sydney
webb
and
he
was
a
member
of
the
fabian
society
the
only
point
where
he
touched
upon
the
same
world
as
the
frivolous
was
his
appreciation
of
the
russian
ballet
he
wrote
rugged
poems
about
prostitutes
dogs
magdalen
college
public
houses
and
country
vicarages
he
held
english
french
and
americans
in
scorn
but
on
the
other
hand
he
was
no
misanthropist
he
would
not
listen
to
a
word
in
dispraise
of
tamils
bengalis
kaffirs
germans
or
greeks
at
the
club
they
thought
him
rather
a
wild
fellow
a
socialist
you
know
they
said
but
he
was
junior
partner
in
a
and
respectable
firm
and
one
of
the
peculiarities
of
china
is
that
your
position
excuses
your
idiosyncrasies
it
may
be
notorious
that
you
beat
your
wife
but
if
you
are
manager
of
a
bank
the
world
will
be
civil
to
you
and
ask
you
to
dinner
so
when
henderson
announced
his
socialistic
opinions
they
merely
laughed
when
he
first
came
to
shanghai
he
refused
to
use
the
jinrickshaw
it
revolted
his
sense
of
personal
dignity
that
a
man
a
human
being
no
different
from
himself
should
drag
him
hither
and
thither
so
he
walked
he
swore
it
was
good
exercise
and
it
kept
him
fit
besides
it
gave
him
a
thirst
he
would
sell
for
twenty
dollars
and
he
drank
his
beer
with
gusto
but
shanghai
is
very
hot
and
sometimes
he
was
in
a
hurry
so
now
and
again
he
was
obliged
to
use
the
degrading
vehicle
it
made
him
feel
uncomfortable
but
it
was
certainly
convenient
presently
he
came
to
use
it
frequently
but
he
always
thought
of
the
boy
between
the
shafts
as
a
man
and
a
brother
he
had
been
three
years
in
shanghai
when
i
saw
him
we
had
spent
the
morning
in
the
chinese
city
going
from
shop
to
shop
and
our
rickshaw
boys
were
hot
with
sweat
every
minute
or
two
they
wiped
their
foreheads
with
ragged
handkerchiefs
we
were
bound
now
for
the
club
and
had
nearly
reached
it
when
henderson
remembered
that
he
wanted
to
get
bertrand
russell
new
book
which
had
just
reached
shanghai
he
stopped
the
boys
and
told
them
to
go
back
do
you
think
we
might
leave
it
till
after
luncheon
i
said
those
fellows
are
sweating
like
pigs
it
good
for
them
he
answered
you
must
ever
pay
attention
to
the
chinese
you
see
we
only
here
because
they
fear
us
we
the
ruling
race
i
did
not
say
anything
i
did
not
even
smile
the
chinese
always
have
had
masters
and
they
always
will
a
passing
car
separated
us
for
a
moment
and
when
he
came
once
more
abreast
of
me
he
had
put
the
matter
aside
you
men
who
live
in
england
do
know
what
it
means
to
us
when
new
books
get
out
here
he
remarked
i
read
everything
that
bertrand
russell
writes
have
you
seen
the
last
one
roads
to
freedom
yes
i
read
it
before
i
left
england
i
read
several
reviews
i
think
he
got
hold
of
some
interesting
ideas
i
think
henderson
was
going
to
enlarge
on
them
but
the
rickshaw
boy
passed
the
turning
he
should
have
taken
round
the
corner
you
bloody
fool
cried
henderson
and
to
emphasize
his
meaning
he
gave
the
man
a
smart
kick
on
the
bottom
xviii
dawn
it
is
night
still
and
the
courtyard
of
the
inn
is
rich
with
deep
patches
of
darkness
lanterns
throw
fitful
lights
on
the
coolies
busily
preparing
their
loads
for
the
journey
they
shout
and
laugh
angrily
argue
with
one
another
and
vociferously
quarrel
i
go
out
into
the
street
and
walk
along
preceded
by
a
boy
with
a
lantern
here
and
there
behind
closed
doors
cocks
are
crowing
but
in
many
of
the
shops
the
shutters
are
down
already
and
the
indefatigable
people
are
beginning
their
long
day
here
an
apprentice
is
sweeping
the
floor
and
there
a
man
is
washing
his
hands
and
face
a
wick
burning
in
a
cup
of
oil
is
all
his
light
i
pass
a
tavern
where
half
a
dozen
persons
are
seated
at
an
early
meal
the
ward
gate
is
closed
but
a
watchman
lets
me
through
a
postern
and
i
walk
along
a
wall
by
a
sluggish
stream
in
which
are
reflected
the
bright
stars
then
i
reach
the
great
gate
of
the
city
and
this
time
one
half
of
it
is
open
i
pass
out
and
there
awaiting
me
all
ghostly
is
the
dawn
the
day
and
the
long
road
and
the
open
country
lie
before
me
put
out
the
lantern
behind
me
the
darkness
pales
to
a
mist
of
purple
and
i
know
that
soon
this
will
kindle
to
a
rosy
flush
i
can
make
out
the
causeway
well
enough
and
the
water
in
the
padi
fields
reflects
already
a
wan
and
shadowy
light
it
is
no
longer
night
but
it
is
not
yet
day
this
is
the
moment
of
most
magical
beauty
when
the
hills
and
the
valleys
the
trees
and
the
water
have
a
mystery
which
is
not
of
earth
for
when
once
the
sun
has
risen
for
a
time
the
world
is
very
cheerless
the
light
is
cold
and
grey
like
the
light
in
a
studio
and
there
are
no
shadows
to
diaper
the
ground
with
a
coloured
pattern
skirting
the
brow
of
a
wooded
hill
i
look
down
on
the
padi
fields
but
to
call
them
fields
is
too
grandiose
they
are
for
the
most
part
crescent
shaped
patches
built
on
the
slope
of
a
hill
one
below
the
other
so
that
they
can
be
flooded
firs
and
bamboos
grow
in
the
hollows
as
though
placed
there
by
a
skilful
gardener
with
a
sense
of
ordered
beauty
to
imitate
formally
the
abandon
of
nature
in
this
moment
of
enchantment
you
do
not
look
upon
the
scene
of
humble
toil
but
on
the
pleasure
gardens
of
an
emperor
here
throwing
aside
the
cares
of
state
he
might
come
in
yellow
silk
embroidered
with
dragons
with
jewelled
bracelets
on
his
wrists
to
sport
with
a
concubine
so
beautiful
that
men
in
after
ages
felt
it
natural
if
a
dynasty
was
destroyed
for
her
sake
and
now
with
the
increasing
day
a
mist
arises
from
the
padi
fields
and
climbs
half
way
up
the
gentle
hills
you
may
see
a
hundred
pictures
of
the
sight
before
you
for
it
is
one
that
the
old
masters
of
china
loved
exceedingly
the
little
hills
wooded
to
their
summit
with
a
line
of
fir
trees
along
the
crest
a
firm
silhouette
against
the
sky
the
little
hills
rise
behind
one
another
and
the
varying
level
of
the
mist
forming
a
pattern
gives
the
composition
a
completeness
which
yet
allows
the
imagination
ample
scope
the
bamboos
grow
right
down
to
the
causeway
their
thin
leaves
shivering
in
the
shadow
of
a
breeze
and
they
grow
with
a
grace
so
that
they
look
like
groups
of
ladies
in
the
great
ming
dynasty
resting
languidly
by
the
they
have
been
to
some
temple
and
their
silken
dresses
are
richly
wrought
with
flowers
and
in
their
hair
are
precious
ornaments
of
jade
they
rest
there
for
a
while
on
their
small
feet
their
golden
lilies
gossiping
elegantly
for
do
they
not
know
that
the
best
use
of
culture
is
to
talk
nonsense
with
distinction
and
in
a
moment
slipping
back
into
their
chairs
they
will
be
gone
but
the
road
turns
and
my
god
the
bamboos
the
chinese
bamboos
transformed
by
some
magic
of
the
mist
look
just
like
the
hops
of
a
kentish
field
do
you
remember
the
sweet
smelling
and
the
fat
green
meadows
the
railway
line
that
runs
along
the
sea
and
the
long
shining
beach
and
the
desolate
greyness
of
the
english
channel
the
seagull
flies
over
the
wintry
coldness
and
the
melancholy
of
its
cry
is
almost
unbearable
xix
the
point
of
honour
nothing
hinders
friendly
relations
between
different
countries
so
much
as
the
fantastic
notions
which
they
cherish
about
one
characteristics
and
perhaps
no
nation
has
suffered
so
much
from
the
misconception
of
its
neighbours
as
the
french
they
have
been
considered
a
frivolous
race
incapable
of
profound
thought
flippant
immoral
and
unreliable
even
the
virtues
that
have
been
allowed
them
their
brilliancy
their
gaiety
have
been
allowed
them
at
least
by
the
english
in
a
patronising
way
for
they
were
not
virtues
on
which
the
set
great
store
it
was
never
realised
that
there
is
a
deep
seriousness
at
the
bottom
of
the
french
character
and
that
the
predominant
concern
of
the
average
frenchman
is
the
concern
for
his
personal
dignity
it
is
by
no
hazard
that
la
rochefoucauld
a
keen
judge
of
human
nature
in
general
and
of
his
countrymen
in
particular
should
have
made
the
pivot
of
his
system
the
punctiliousness
with
which
our
neighbours
regard
it
has
often
entertained
the
briton
who
is
accustomed
to
look
upon
himself
with
humour
but
it
is
a
living
force
as
the
phrase
goes
with
the
frenchman
and
you
can
not
hope
to
understand
him
unless
you
bear
in
mind
always
the
susceptibility
of
his
sense
of
honour
these
reflections
were
suggested
to
me
whenever
i
saw
the
vicomte
de
steenvoorde
driving
in
his
sumptuous
car
or
seated
at
the
head
of
his
own
table
he
represented
certain
important
french
interests
in
china
and
was
said
to
have
more
power
at
the
quai
than
the
minister
himself
there
was
never
a
very
cordial
feeling
between
the
pair
since
the
latter
not
unnaturally
resented
that
one
of
his
nationals
should
deal
in
diplomatic
matters
with
the
chinese
behind
his
back
the
esteem
in
which
de
steenvoorde
was
held
at
home
was
sufficiently
proved
by
the
red
button
that
adorned
the
lappet
of
his
frock
coat
the
vicomte
had
a
fine
head
somewhat
bald
but
not
unbecomingly
légère
as
the
french
novelists
put
it
and
thereby
rob
the
cruel
fact
of
half
its
sting
a
nose
like
the
great
duke
of
wellington
bright
black
eyes
under
heavy
eyelids
and
a
small
mouth
hidden
by
an
exceedingly
handsome
moustache
the
ends
of
which
he
twisted
a
great
deal
with
white
richly
jewelled
fingers
his
air
of
dignity
was
heightened
by
three
massive
chins
he
had
a
big
trunk
and
an
imposing
corpulence
so
that
when
he
sat
at
table
he
sat
a
little
away
from
it
as
though
he
ate
under
protest
and
were
just
there
for
a
snack
but
nature
had
played
a
dirty
though
not
uncommon
trick
on
him
for
his
legs
were
much
too
short
for
his
body
so
that
though
seated
he
had
all
the
appearance
of
a
tall
man
you
were
taken
aback
to
find
when
he
stood
up
that
he
was
hardly
of
average
height
it
was
for
this
reason
that
he
made
his
best
effect
at
table
or
when
he
was
driving
through
the
city
in
his
car
then
his
presence
was
commanding
when
he
waved
to
you
or
with
a
broad
gesture
took
off
his
hat
you
felt
that
it
was
incredibly
affable
of
him
to
take
any
notice
of
human
beings
he
had
all
the
solid
respectability
of
those
statesmen
of
louis
philippe
in
sober
black
with
their
long
hair
and
faces
who
look
out
at
you
with
portentous
solemnity
from
the
canvases
of
ingres
one
often
hears
of
people
who
talk
like
a
book
de
steenvoorde
talked
like
a
magazine
not
of
course
a
magazine
devoted
to
light
literature
and
the
distraction
of
an
idle
hour
but
a
magazine
of
sound
learning
and
influential
opinion
de
steenvoorde
talked
like
the
des
deux
it
was
a
treat
though
a
little
fatiguing
to
listen
to
him
he
had
the
fluency
of
those
who
have
said
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
he
never
hesitated
for
a
word
he
put
everything
with
lucidity
an
admirable
choice
of
language
and
such
an
authority
that
in
his
lips
the
obvious
had
all
the
sparkle
of
an
epigram
he
was
by
no
means
without
wit
he
could
be
very
amusing
at
the
expense
of
his
neighbours
and
when
having
said
something
peculiarly
malicious
he
turned
to
you
with
an
observation
absents
ont
toujours
he
managed
to
invest
it
with
the
freshness
of
an
original
aphorism
he
was
an
ardent
catholic
but
he
flattered
himself
no
reactionary
a
man
of
standing
substance
and
principle
a
poor
man
but
ambitious
fame
the
last
infirmity
of
noble
mind
he
had
married
for
her
enormous
dot
the
daughter
of
a
sugar
broker
now
a
painted
little
lady
with
hennaed
hair
in
beautiful
clothes
and
it
must
have
been
a
sore
trial
to
him
that
when
he
gave
her
his
honoured
name
he
could
not
also
endow
her
with
the
sense
of
personal
pride
which
was
so
powerful
a
motive
in
all
his
actions
for
like
many
great
men
de
steenvoorde
was
married
to
a
wife
who
was
extremely
unfaithful
to
him
but
this
misfortune
he
bore
with
a
courage
and
a
dignity
which
were
absolutely
characteristic
his
demeanour
was
so
perfect
that
his
infelicity
positively
raised
him
in
the
eyes
of
his
friends
he
was
to
all
an
object
of
sympathy
he
might
be
a
cuckold
but
he
remained
a
person
of
quality
whenever
indeed
mme
de
steenvoorde
took
a
new
lover
he
insisted
that
her
parents
should
give
him
a
sufficient
sum
of
money
to
make
good
the
outrage
to
his
name
and
honour
common
report
put
it
at
a
quarter
of
a
million
francs
but
with
silver
at
its
present
price
i
believe
that
a
business
man
would
insist
on
being
paid
in
dollars
de
steenvoorde
is
already
a
man
of
means
but
before
his
wife
reaches
the
canonical
age
he
will
undoubtedly
be
a
rich
one
xx
the
beast
of
burden
at
first
when
you
see
the
coolie
on
the
road
bearing
his
load
it
is
as
a
pleasing
object
that
he
strikes
the
eye
in
his
blue
rags
a
blue
of
all
colours
from
indigo
to
turquoise
and
then
to
the
paleness
of
a
milky
sky
he
fits
the
landscape
he
seems
exactly
right
as
he
trudges
along
the
narrow
causeway
between
the
rice
fields
or
climbs
a
green
hill
his
clothing
consists
of
no
more
than
a
short
coat
and
a
pair
of
trousers
and
if
he
had
a
suit
which
was
at
the
beginning
all
of
a
piece
he
never
thinks
when
it
comes
to
patching
to
choose
a
bit
of
stuff
of
the
same
colour
he
takes
anything
that
comes
handy
from
sun
and
rain
he
protects
his
head
with
a
straw
hat
shaped
like
an
extinguisher
with
a
preposterously
wide
flat
brim
you
see
a
string
of
coolies
come
along
one
after
the
other
each
with
a
pole
on
his
shoulders
from
the
ends
of
which
hang
two
great
bales
and
they
make
an
agreeable
pattern
it
is
amusing
to
watch
their
hurrying
reflections
in
the
padi
water
you
watch
their
faces
as
they
pass
you
they
are
faces
and
frank
you
would
have
said
if
it
had
not
been
drilled
into
you
that
the
oriental
is
inscrutable
and
when
you
see
them
lying
down
with
their
loads
under
a
banyan
tree
by
a
wayside
shrine
smoking
and
chatting
gaily
if
you
have
tried
to
lift
the
bales
they
carry
for
thirty
miles
or
more
a
day
it
seems
natural
to
feel
admiration
for
their
endurance
and
their
spirit
but
you
will
be
thought
somewhat
absurd
if
you
mention
your
admiration
to
the
old
residents
of
china
you
will
be
told
with
a
tolerant
shrug
of
the
shoulders
that
the
coolies
are
animals
and
for
two
thousand
years
from
father
to
son
have
carried
burdens
so
it
is
no
wonder
if
they
do
it
cheerfully
and
indeed
you
can
see
for
yourself
that
they
begin
early
for
you
will
encounter
little
children
with
a
yoke
on
their
shoulders
staggering
under
the
weight
of
vegetable
baskets
the
day
wears
on
and
it
grows
warmer
the
coolies
take
off
their
coats
and
walk
stripped
to
the
waist
then
sometimes
in
a
man
resting
for
an
instant
his
load
on
the
ground
but
the
pole
still
on
his
shoulders
so
that
he
has
to
rest
slightly
crouched
you
see
the
poor
tired
heart
beating
against
the
ribs
you
see
it
as
plainly
as
in
some
cases
of
heart
disease
in
the
room
of
a
hospital
it
is
strangely
distressing
to
watch
then
also
you
see
the
coolies
backs
the
pressure
of
the
pole
for
long
years
day
after
day
has
made
hard
red
scars
and
sometimes
even
there
are
open
sores
great
sores
without
bandages
or
dressing
that
rub
against
the
wood
but
the
strangest
thing
of
all
is
that
sometimes
as
though
nature
sought
to
adapt
man
for
these
cruel
uses
to
which
he
is
put
an
odd
malformation
seems
to
have
arisen
so
that
there
is
a
sort
of
hump
like
a
camel
against
which
the
pole
rests
but
beating
heart
or
angry
sore
bitter
rain
or
burning
sun
notwithstanding
they
go
on
eternally
from
dawn
till
dusk
year
in
year
out
from
childhood
to
the
extreme
of
age
you
see
old
men
without
an
ounce
of
fat
on
their
bodies
their
skin
loose
on
their
bones
wizened
their
little
faces
wrinkled
and
apelike
with
hair
thin
and
grey
and
they
totter
under
their
burdens
to
the
edge
of
the
grave
in
which
at
last
they
shall
have
rest
and
still
the
coolies
go
not
exactly
running
but
not
walking
either
sidling
quickly
with
their
eyes
on
the
ground
to
choose
the
spot
to
place
their
feet
and
on
their
faces
a
strained
anxious
expression
you
can
make
no
longer
a
pattern
of
them
as
they
wend
their
way
their
effort
oppresses
you
you
are
filled
with
a
useless
compassion
in
china
it
is
man
that
is
the
beast
of
burden
be
harassed
by
the
wear
and
tear
of
life
and
to
pass
rapidly
through
it
without
the
possibility
of
arresting
one
course
is
not
this
pitiful
indeed
to
labour
without
ceasing
and
then
without
living
to
enjoy
the
fruit
worn
out
to
depart
suddenly
one
knows
not
whither
is
not
that
a
just
cause
for
grief
so
wrote
the
chinese
mystic
xxi
macalister
he
was
a
fine
figure
of
a
man
hard
upon
sixty
i
should
think
when
i
knew
him
but
hale
still
and
active
he
was
stout
but
his
great
height
enabled
him
to
carry
his
corpulence
with
dignity
he
had
a
strong
almost
a
handsome
face
with
a
hooked
nose
bushy
white
eyebrows
and
a
firm
chin
he
was
dressed
in
black
and
he
wore
a
low
collar
and
a
white
bow
tie
he
had
the
look
of
an
english
divine
of
a
past
generation
his
voice
was
resonant
and
hearty
and
he
laughed
boisterously
his
career
was
somewhat
out
of
the
common
he
had
come
to
china
thirty
years
before
as
a
medical
missionary
but
now
though
still
on
good
terms
with
the
mission
he
was
no
longer
a
member
it
had
been
decided
it
appears
to
build
a
school
on
a
certain
desirable
spot
which
the
doctor
had
hit
upon
and
in
a
crowded
chinese
city
it
is
never
very
easy
to
find
building
land
but
when
the
mission
after
much
bargaining
had
eventually
bought
this
the
discovery
was
made
that
the
owner
was
not
the
chinese
with
whom
the
negotiations
had
been
conducted
but
the
doctor
himself
knowing
that
the
school
must
be
built
and
seeing
that
no
other
piece
of
land
was
available
he
had
borrowed
money
from
a
chinese
banker
and
bought
it
himself
the
transaction
was
not
dishonest
but
perhaps
it
was
a
little
unscrupulous
and
the
other
members
of
the
mission
did
not
look
upon
it
as
the
good
joke
that
macalister
did
they
displayed
even
a
certain
acrimony
and
the
result
was
that
macalister
though
preserving
friendly
relations
with
persons
with
whose
aims
and
interests
he
was
in
the
fullest
sympathy
resigned
his
position
he
was
known
to
be
a
clever
doctor
and
he
soon
had
a
large
practice
both
among
the
foreigners
and
the
chinese
he
started
a
hostel
in
which
the
traveller
at
a
price
and
a
high
one
could
have
board
and
lodging
his
guests
complained
a
little
because
they
were
not
allowed
to
drink
alcohol
but
it
was
much
more
comfortable
than
a
chinese
inn
and
some
allowance
had
to
be
made
for
the
doctor
principles
he
was
a
man
of
resource
he
bought
a
large
piece
of
land
on
a
hill
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
and
put
up
bungalows
which
he
sold
one
by
one
to
the
missionaries
as
summer
resorts
and
he
owned
a
large
store
in
which
he
sold
everything
from
picture
postcards
and
curios
to
worcester
sauce
and
knitted
jumpers
which
a
foreigner
could
possibly
want
he
made
a
very
good
thing
out
of
it
he
had
a
commercial
bent
the
tiffin
he
invited
me
to
was
quite
an
imposing
function
he
lived
above
his
store
in
a
large
apartment
overlooking
the
river
the
party
consisted
of
macalister
and
his
third
wife
a
lady
of
in
spectacles
and
black
satin
a
missionary
spending
a
few
days
with
the
doctor
on
his
way
into
the
interior
and
two
silent
young
ladies
who
had
just
joined
the
mission
and
were
busily
learning
chinese
on
the
walls
of
the
hung
a
number
of
congratulatory
scrolls
which
had
been
presented
to
my
host
by
chinese
friends
and
converts
on
his
fiftieth
birthday
there
was
a
great
deal
of
food
as
there
always
is
in
china
and
macalister
did
full
justice
to
it
the
meal
began
and
ended
with
a
long
grace
which
he
said
in
his
deep
voice
with
an
impressive
unction
when
we
returned
to
the
macalister
standing
in
front
of
the
grateful
fire
for
it
can
be
very
cold
in
china
took
a
little
photograph
from
the
chimney
piece
and
showed
it
to
me
do
you
know
who
that
is
he
asked
it
was
the
photograph
of
a
very
thin
young
missionary
in
a
low
collar
and
a
white
tie
with
large
melancholy
eyes
and
a
look
of
profound
seriousness
nice
looking
fellow
eh
boomed
the
doctor
very
i
answered
a
somewhat
priggish
young
man
possibly
but
priggishness
is
a
pardonable
defect
in
youth
and
here
it
was
certainly
counterbalanced
by
the
appealing
wistfulness
of
the
expression
it
was
a
fine
a
sensitive
and
even
a
beautiful
face
and
those
disconsolate
eyes
were
strangely
moving
there
was
fanaticism
there
perhaps
but
there
was
the
courage
that
would
not
fear
martyrdom
there
was
a
charming
idealism
and
its
youth
its
ingenuousness
warmed
one
heart
a
most
attractive
face
i
said
as
i
returned
the
photograph
macalister
gave
a
chuckle
that
what
i
looked
like
when
i
first
came
out
to
china
he
said
it
was
a
photograph
of
himself
no
one
recognises
it
smiled
macalister
it
was
the
very
image
of
me
he
said
he
spread
out
the
tails
of
his
black
coat
and
planted
himself
more
firmly
in
front
of
the
fire
i
often
laugh
when
i
think
of
my
first
impressions
of
china
he
said
i
came
out
expecting
to
undergo
hardships
and
privations
my
first
shock
was
the
steamer
with
dinners
and
accommodation
there
was
much
hardship
in
that
but
i
said
to
myself
wait
till
you
get
to
china
well
at
shanghai
i
was
met
by
some
friends
and
i
stayed
in
a
fine
house
and
was
waited
on
by
fine
servants
and
i
ate
fine
food
shanghai
i
said
the
plague
spot
of
the
east
it
be
different
in
the
interior
at
last
i
reached
here
i
was
to
stay
with
the
head
of
the
mission
till
my
own
quarters
were
ready
he
lived
in
a
large
compound
he
had
a
very
nice
house
with
american
furniture
in
it
and
i
slept
in
a
better
bed
than
i
ever
slept
in
he
was
very
fond
of
his
garden
and
he
grew
all
kinds
of
vegetables
in
it
we
had
salads
just
like
the
salads
we
had
in
america
and
fruit
all
kinds
of
fruit
he
kept
a
cow
and
we
had
fresh
milk
and
butter
i
thought
i
never
eaten
so
much
and
so
well
in
my
life
you
did
nothing
for
yourself
if
you
wanted
a
glass
of
water
you
called
a
boy
and
he
brought
it
to
you
it
was
the
beginning
of
summer
when
i
arrived
and
they
were
all
packing
up
to
go
to
the
hills
they
had
got
bungalows
then
but
they
used
to
spend
the
summer
in
a
temple
i
began
to
think
i
should
have
to
put
up
with
much
privation
after
all
i
had
been
looking
forward
to
a
martyr
crown
do
you
know
what
i
did
macalister
chuckled
as
he
thought
of
that
long
passed
time
the
first
night
i
got
here
when
i
was
alone
in
my
room
i
threw
myself
on
my
bed
and
i
just
cried
like
a
child
macalister
went
on
talking
but
i
could
not
pay
much
attention
to
what
he
said
i
wondered
by
what
steps
he
had
come
to
be
the
man
i
knew
now
from
the
man
he
had
been
then
that
is
the
story
i
should
like
to
write
xxii
the
road
it
is
not
a
road
at
all
but
a
causeway
made
of
paving
stones
about
a
foot
wide
and
four
feet
broad
so
that
there
is
just
room
for
two
sedan
chairs
with
caution
to
pass
each
other
for
the
most
part
it
is
in
good
enough
repair
but
here
and
there
the
stones
are
broken
or
swept
away
by
the
flooding
of
the
rice
fields
and
then
walking
is
difficult
it
winds
tortuously
along
the
path
which
has
connected
city
to
city
since
first
a
thousand
years
ago
or
more
there
were
cities
in
the
land
it
winds
between
the
rice
fields
following
the
accidents
of
the
country
with
a
careful
nonchalance
and
you
can
tell
that
it
was
built
on
a
track
made
by
the
peasant
of
dim
ages
past
who
sought
not
the
quickest
but
the
easiest
way
to
walk
the
beginnings
of
it
you
may
see
when
leaving
the
main
road
you
cut
across
country
bound
for
some
town
that
is
apart
from
the
main
line
of
traffic
then
the
causeway
is
so
narrow
that
there
is
no
room
for
a
coolie
bearing
a
load
to
pass
and
if
you
are
in
the
midst
of
the
rice
fields
he
has
to
get
on
the
little
bank
planted
with
beans
that
divides
one
from
another
till
you
go
by
presently
the
stones
are
wanting
and
you
travel
along
a
path
of
trodden
mud
so
narrow
that
your
bearers
step
warily
the
journey
for
all
the
stories
of
bandits
with
which
they
sought
to
deter
you
and
the
ragged
soldiers
of
your
escort
is
devoid
of
adventure
but
it
is
crowded
with
incident
first
there
is
the
constant
variety
of
the
dawn
poets
have
written
of
it
with
enthusiasm
but
they
are
and
they
have
trusted
for
inspiration
to
their
fancy
rather
than
to
their
sleepy
eyes
like
a
mistress
known
in
the
dream
of
a
moonlit
night
who
has
charms
unshared
by
the
beauties
of
the
wakeful
day
they
have
ascribed
to
it
excellencies
which
are
only
of
the
imagination
for
the
most
exquisite
dawn
has
none
of
the
splendour
of
an
indifferent
sunset
but
because
it
is
a
less
accustomed
sight
it
seems
to
have
a
greater
diversity
every
dawn
is
a
little
different
from
every
other
and
you
can
fancy
that
each
day
the
world
is
created
anew
not
quite
the
same
as
it
was
the
day
before
then
there
are
the
common
sights
of
the
a
peasant
thigh
deep
in
water
ploughs
his
field
with
a
plough
as
primitive
as
those
his
fathers
have
used
for
forty
mortal
centuries
the
water
buffalo
splashes
sinister
through
the
mud
and
his
cynical
eyes
seem
to
ask
what
end
has
been
served
by
this
unending
toil
an
old
woman
goes
by
in
her
blue
smock
and
short
blue
trousers
on
bound
feet
and
she
supports
her
unsteady
steps
with
a
long
staff
two
fat
chinese
in
chairs
pass
you
and
passing
stare
at
you
with
curious
yet
listless
eyes
everyone
you
see
is
an
incident
however
trivial
sufficient
to
arouse
your
fancy
for
an
instant
and
now
your
eyes
rest
with
pleasure
on
the
smooth
skin
like
yellow
ivory
of
a
young
mother
sauntering
along
with
a
child
strapped
to
her
back
on
the
wrinkled
inscrutable
visage
of
an
old
man
or
on
the
fine
bones
visible
through
the
flesh
of
the
face
of
a
strapping
coolie
and
beside
all
this
there
is
the
constant
delight
with
which
having
climbed
laboriously
a
hill
you
see
the
country
spread
out
before
you
for
days
and
days
it
is
just
the
same
but
each
time
you
see
it
you
have
the
same
little
thrill
of
discovery
the
same
little
rounded
hills
like
a
flock
of
sheep
surrounding
you
succeeding
one
another
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
and
on
many
a
lone
tree
as
though
planted
deliberately
for
the
sake
of
the
picturesque
outlines
its
gracious
pattern
against
the
sky
the
same
groves
of
bamboo
lean
delicately
almost
surrounding
the
same
farm
houses
which
with
their
clustering
roofs
nestle
pleasantly
in
the
same
sheltered
hollows
the
bamboos
lean
over
the
highway
with
an
adorable
grace
they
have
the
condescension
of
great
ladies
which
flatters
rather
than
wounds
they
have
the
abandon
of
flowers
a
wantonness
that
is
too
sure
of
its
good
breeding
ever
to
be
in
danger
of
debauchery
but
the
memorial
arch
to
virtuous
widow
or
to
fortunate
scholar
warns
you
that
you
are
approaching
a
village
or
a
town
and
you
pass
affording
a
moment
sensation
to
the
inhabitants
through
a
ragged
line
of
sordid
hovels
or
a
busy
street
the
street
is
shaded
from
the
sun
by
great
mats
stretched
from
eave
to
eave
the
light
is
dim
and
the
thronging
crowd
has
an
unnatural
air
you
think
that
so
must
have
looked
the
people
in
those
cities
of
magicians
which
the
arab
traveller
knew
and
where
during
the
night
a
terrible
transformation
befell
you
so
that
till
you
found
the
magic
formula
to
free
you
you
went
through
life
in
the
guise
of
a
ass
or
of
a
green
and
yellow
parrot
the
merchants
in
their
open
shops
seem
to
sell
no
common
merchandise
and
in
the
taverns
messes
are
prepared
of
things
horrible
for
men
to
eat
your
eye
amid
the
uniformity
for
every
chinese
town
at
all
events
to
the
stranger
eye
much
resembles
every
other
takes
pleasure
in
noting
trivial
differences
and
so
you
observe
the
predominant
industries
of
each
one
every
town
makes
all
that
its
inhabitants
require
but
it
has
also
a
speciality
and
here
you
will
find
cotton
cloth
there
string
and
here
again
silk
now
the
orange
tree
golden
with
fruit
grows
scarce
and
the
sugar
cane
makes
its
appearance
the
black
silk
cap
gives
way
to
the
turban
and
the
red
umbrella
of
oiled
paper
to
the
umbrella
of
bright
blue
cotton
but
these
are
the
common
incidents
of
every
day
they
are
like
the
expected
happenings
of
life
which
keep
it
from
monotony
working
days
and
holidays
meetings
with
your
friends
the
coming
of
spring
with
its
elation
and
the
coming
of
winter
with
its
long
evenings
its
easy
intimacies
and
its
twilight
now
and
then
as
love
enters
making
all
the
rest
but
a
setting
for
its
radiance
and
lifts
the
common
affairs
of
the
day
to
a
level
on
which
the
most
trifling
things
have
a
mysterious
significance
now
and
then
the
common
round
is
interrupted
and
you
are
faced
by
a
beauty
which
takes
your
soul
all
unprepared
by
assault
for
looming
through
the
mist
you
may
see
the
fantastic
roofs
of
a
temple
loftily
raised
on
a
huge
stone
bastion
around
which
a
natural
moat
flows
a
quiet
green
river
and
when
the
sun
lights
it
you
seem
to
see
the
dream
of
a
chinese
palace
a
palace
as
rich
and
splendid
as
those
which
haunted
the
fancy
of
the
arabian
story
tellers
or
crossing
a
ferry
at
dawn
you
may
see
a
little
above
you
silhouetted
against
the
sunrise
a
sampan
in
which
a
ferryman
is
carrying
a
crowd
of
passengers
you
recognise
on
a
sudden
charon
and
you
know
that
his
passengers
are
the
melancholy
dead
xxiii
god
truth
birch
was
the
agent
of
the
and
he
was
stationed
in
a
little
town
of
the
interior
with
streets
which
after
it
had
rained
were
a
foot
deep
in
mud
then
you
had
to
get
right
inside
your
cart
to
prevent
yourself
from
being
splashed
from
head
to
foot
the
roadway
worn
to
pieces
by
the
ceaseless
traffic
was
so
full
of
holes
that
the
breath
was
jolted
out
of
your
body
as
you
jogged
along
at
a
foot
pace
there
were
two
or
three
streets
of
shops
but
he
knew
by
heart
everything
that
was
in
them
and
there
were
interminable
winding
alleys
which
presented
a
monotonous
expanse
of
wall
broken
only
by
solid
closed
doors
these
were
the
chinese
houses
and
they
were
as
impenetrable
to
one
of
his
colour
as
the
life
which
surrounded
him
he
was
very
homesick
he
had
not
spoken
to
a
white
man
for
three
months
his
day
work
was
over
since
he
had
nothing
else
to
do
he
went
for
the
only
walk
there
was
he
went
out
of
the
city
gate
and
strolled
along
the
ragged
road
with
its
deep
ruts
into
the
country
the
valley
was
bounded
by
wild
barren
mountains
and
they
seemed
to
shut
him
in
he
felt
immeasurably
far
away
from
civilisation
he
knew
he
could
not
afford
to
surrender
to
that
sense
of
utter
loneliness
which
beset
him
but
it
was
more
of
an
effort
than
usual
to
keep
a
stiff
upper
lip
he
was
very
nearly
at
the
end
of
his
tether
suddenly
he
saw
a
white
man
riding
towards
him
on
a
pony
behind
came
slowly
a
chinese
cart
in
which
presumably
were
his
belongings
birch
guessed
at
once
that
this
was
a
missionary
going
down
to
one
of
the
from
his
station
further
up
country
and
his
heart
leaped
with
joy
at
last
he
would
have
some
one
to
talk
to
he
hurried
his
steps
his
lassitude
left
him
he
was
all
alert
he
was
almost
running
when
he
came
up
to
the
rider
hulloa
he
said
where
have
you
sprung
from
the
rider
stopped
and
named
a
distant
town
i
am
on
my
way
down
to
take
the
train
he
added
you
better
put
up
with
me
for
the
night
i
have
seen
a
white
man
for
three
months
there
lots
of
room
at
my
place
you
know
said
the
rider
his
face
changed
and
his
eyes
before
friendly
and
smiling
grew
hard
i
do
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
you
he
gave
his
pony
a
kick
and
started
on
but
birch
seized
the
bridle
he
could
not
believe
his
ears
what
do
you
mean
i
ca
have
anything
to
do
with
a
man
who
trades
in
tobacco
let
go
that
bridle
but
i
not
spoken
to
a
white
man
for
three
months
that
no
business
of
mine
let
go
that
bridle
he
gave
his
pony
another
kick
his
lips
were
obstinately
set
and
he
looked
at
birch
sternly
then
birch
lost
his
temper
he
clung
to
the
bridle
as
the
pony
moved
on
and
began
to
curse
the
missionary
he
hurled
at
him
every
term
of
abuse
he
could
think
of
he
swore
he
was
horribly
obscene
the
missionary
did
not
answer
but
urged
his
pony
on
birch
seized
the
missionary
leg
and
jerked
it
out
of
the
stirrup
the
missionary
nearly
fell
off
and
he
clung
in
a
somewhat
undignified
fashion
to
the
pony
mane
then
he
half
slipped
half
tumbled
to
the
ground
the
cart
had
come
up
to
them
by
now
and
stopped
the
two
chinese
who
were
sitting
in
it
looked
at
the
white
men
with
indolent
curiosity
the
missionary
was
livid
with
rage
you
assaulted
me
i
have
you
fired
for
that
you
can
go
to
hell
said
birch
i
have
seen
a
white
man
for
three
months
and
you
wo
even
speak
to
me
do
you
call
yourself
a
christian
what
is
your
name
birch
is
my
name
and
be
damned
to
you
i
shall
report
you
to
your
chief
now
stand
back
and
let
me
get
on
my
journey
birch
clenched
his
hands
get
a
move
on
or
i
break
every
bone
in
your
body
the
missionary
mounted
gave
his
pony
a
sharp
cut
with
the
whip
and
cantered
away
the
chinese
cart
lumbered
slowly
after
but
when
birch
was
left
alone
his
anger
left
him
and
a
sob
broke
unwillingly
from
his
lips
the
barren
mountains
were
less
hard
than
the
heart
of
man
he
turned
and
walked
slowly
back
to
the
little
walled
city
xxiv
romance
all
day
i
had
been
dropping
down
the
river
this
was
the
river
up
which
chang
chien
seeking
its
source
had
sailed
for
many
days
till
he
came
to
a
city
where
he
saw
a
girl
spinning
and
a
youth
leading
an
ox
to
the
water
he
asked
what
place
this
was
and
in
reply
the
girl
gave
him
her
shuttle
telling
him
to
show
it
on
his
return
to
the
astrologer
yen
who
would
thus
know
where
he
had
been
he
did
so
and
the
astrologer
at
once
recognised
the
shuttle
as
that
of
the
spinning
damsel
further
declaring
that
on
the
day
and
at
the
hour
when
chang
chien
received
the
shuttle
he
had
noticed
a
wandering
star
intrude
itself
between
the
spinning
damsel
and
the
cowherd
so
chang
chien
knew
that
he
had
sailed
upon
the
bosom
of
the
milky
way
i
however
had
not
been
so
far
all
day
as
for
seven
days
before
my
five
rowers
standing
up
had
rowed
and
there
rang
still
in
my
ears
the
monotonous
sound
of
their
oars
against
the
wooden
pin
that
served
as
rowlock
now
and
again
the
water
became
very
shallow
and
there
was
a
jar
and
a
jolt
as
we
scraped
along
the
stones
of
the
river
bed
then
two
or
three
of
the
rowers
turned
up
their
blue
trousers
to
the
hip
and
let
themselves
over
the
side
shouting
they
dragged
the
boat
over
the
shoal
now
and
again
we
came
to
a
rapid
of
no
great
consequence
when
compared
with
the
turbulent
rapids
of
the
yangtze
but
sufficiently
swift
to
call
for
trackers
to
pull
the
junks
that
were
going
up
stream
and
we
going
down
passed
through
them
with
many
shouts
shot
the
foaming
breakers
and
presently
reached
water
as
smooth
as
any
lake
now
it
was
night
and
my
crew
were
asleep
forward
huddled
together
in
such
shelter
as
they
had
been
able
to
rig
up
when
we
moored
at
dusk
i
sat
on
my
bed
bamboo
matting
spread
over
three
wooden
arches
made
the
sorry
cabin
which
for
a
week
had
served
me
as
parlour
and
bedroom
it
was
closed
at
one
end
by
matchboarding
so
roughly
put
together
that
there
were
large
chinks
between
each
board
the
bitter
wind
blew
through
them
it
was
on
the
other
side
of
this
that
the
crew
fine
sturdy
fellows
rowed
by
day
and
slept
by
night
joined
then
by
the
steersman
who
had
stood
from
dawn
to
dusk
in
a
tattered
blue
gown
and
a
wadded
coat
of
faded
grey
a
black
turban
round
his
head
at
the
long
oar
which
was
his
helm
there
was
no
furniture
but
my
bed
a
shallow
dish
like
an
enormous
in
which
burned
charcoal
for
it
was
cold
a
basket
containing
my
clothes
which
i
used
as
a
table
and
a
hurricane
lamp
which
hung
from
one
of
the
arches
and
swayed
slightly
with
the
motion
of
the
water
the
cabin
was
so
low
that
i
a
person
of
no
great
height
i
comfort
myself
with
bacon
observation
that
with
tall
men
it
is
as
with
tall
houses
the
top
story
is
commonly
the
least
furnished
could
only
just
stand
upright
one
of
the
sleepers
began
to
snore
more
loudly
and
perhaps
he
awoke
two
of
the
others
for
i
heard
the
sound
of
speaking
but
presently
this
ceased
the
snorer
was
quiet
and
all
about
me
once
more
was
silence
then
suddenly
i
had
a
feeling
that
here
facing
me
touching
me
almost
was
the
romance
i
sought
it
was
a
feeling
like
no
other
just
as
specific
as
the
thrill
of
art
but
i
could
not
for
the
life
of
me
tell
what
it
was
that
had
given
me
just
then
that
rare
emotion
in
the
course
of
my
life
i
have
been
often
in
situations
which
had
i
read
of
them
would
have
seemed
to
me
sufficiently
romantic
but
it
is
only
in
retrospect
comparing
them
with
my
ideas
of
what
was
romantic
that
i
have
seen
them
as
at
all
out
of
the
ordinary
it
is
only
by
an
effort
of
the
imagination
making
myself
as
it
were
a
spectator
of
myself
acting
a
part
that
i
have
caught
anything
of
the
precious
quality
in
circumstances
which
in
others
would
have
seemed
to
me
instinct
with
its
fine
flower
when
i
have
danced
with
an
actress
whose
fascination
and
whose
genius
made
her
the
idol
of
my
country
or
wandered
through
the
halls
of
some
great
house
in
which
was
gathered
all
that
was
distinguished
by
lineage
or
intellect
that
london
could
show
i
have
only
recognized
afterwards
that
here
perhaps
though
in
somewhat
ouidaesque
a
fashion
was
romance
in
battle
when
myself
in
no
great
danger
i
was
able
to
watch
events
with
a
thrill
of
interest
i
had
not
the
phlegm
to
assume
the
part
of
a
spectator
i
have
sailed
through
the
night
under
the
full
moon
to
a
coral
island
in
the
pacific
and
then
the
beauty
and
the
wonder
of
the
scene
gave
me
a
conscious
happiness
but
only
later
the
exhilarating
sense
that
romance
and
i
had
touched
fingers
i
heard
the
flutter
of
its
wings
when
once
in
the
bedroom
of
a
hotel
in
new
york
i
sat
round
a
table
with
half
a
dozen
others
and
made
plans
to
restore
an
ancient
kingdom
whose
wrongs
have
for
a
century
inspired
the
poet
and
the
patriot
but
my
chief
feeling
was
a
surprised
amusement
that
through
the
hazards
of
war
i
found
myself
engaged
in
business
so
foreign
to
my
bent
the
authentic
thrill
of
romance
has
seized
me
under
circumstances
which
one
would
have
thought
far
less
romantic
and
i
remember
that
i
knew
it
first
one
evening
when
i
was
playing
cards
in
a
cottage
on
the
coast
of
brittany
in
the
next
room
an
old
fisherman
lay
dying
and
the
women
of
the
house
said
that
he
would
go
out
with
the
tide
without
a
storm
was
raging
and
it
seemed
fit
for
the
last
moments
of
that
aged
warrior
of
the
seas
that
his
going
should
be
accompanied
by
the
wild
cries
of
the
wind
as
it
hurled
itself
against
the
shuttered
windows
the
waves
thundered
upon
the
tortured
rocks
i
felt
a
sudden
exultation
for
i
knew
that
here
was
romance
and
now
the
same
exultation
seized
me
and
once
more
romance
like
a
bodily
presence
was
before
me
but
it
had
come
so
unexpectedly
that
i
was
intrigued
i
could
not
tell
whether
it
had
crept
in
among
the
shadows
that
the
lamp
threw
on
the
bamboo
matting
or
whether
it
was
wafted
down
the
river
that
i
saw
through
the
opening
of
my
cabin
curious
to
know
what
were
the
elements
that
made
up
the
ineffable
delight
of
the
moment
i
went
out
to
the
stern
of
the
boat
alongside
were
moored
half
a
dozen
junks
going
up
river
for
their
masts
were
erect
and
everything
was
silent
in
them
their
crews
were
long
since
asleep
the
night
was
not
dark
for
though
it
was
cloudy
the
moon
was
full
but
the
river
in
that
veiled
light
was
ghostly
a
vague
mist
blurred
the
trees
on
the
further
bank
it
was
an
enchanting
sight
but
there
was
in
it
nothing
unaccustomed
and
what
i
sought
was
not
there
i
turned
away
but
when
i
returned
to
my
bamboo
shelter
the
magic
which
had
given
it
so
extraordinary
a
character
was
gone
alas
i
was
like
a
man
who
should
tear
a
butterfly
to
pieces
in
order
to
discover
in
what
its
beauty
lay
and
yet
as
moses
descending
from
mount
sinai
wore
on
his
face
a
brightness
from
his
converse
with
the
god
of
israel
my
little
cabin
my
dish
of
charcoal
my
lamp
even
my
camp
bed
had
still
about
them
something
of
the
thrill
which
for
a
moment
was
mine
i
could
not
see
them
any
more
quite
indifferently
because
for
a
moment
i
had
seen
them
magically
xxv
the
grand
style
he
was
a
very
old
man
it
was
years
since
he
came
to
china
as
a
ship
doctor
and
took
the
place
in
one
of
the
southern
ports
of
a
medical
officer
whose
health
had
obliged
him
to
go
home
he
could
not
then
have
been
less
than
so
that
now
he
must
have
been
well
over
eighty
he
was
a
tall
man
very
thin
and
his
skin
hung
on
his
bones
like
a
suit
of
clothes
much
too
large
for
him
under
his
chin
was
a
great
sack
like
the
wattle
of
an
old
but
his
blue
eyes
large
and
bright
had
kept
their
colour
and
his
voice
was
strong
and
deep
in
these
seven
and
fifty
years
he
had
bought
and
sold
three
or
four
practices
along
the
coast
and
now
he
was
back
once
more
within
a
few
miles
of
the
port
in
which
he
had
first
lived
it
was
an
anchorage
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
where
the
steamers
unable
owing
to
their
draught
to
reach
the
city
discharged
and
loaded
their
cargo
there
were
only
seven
white
men
houses
a
small
hospital
and
a
handful
of
chinese
so
that
it
would
not
have
been
worth
a
doctor
while
to
settle
there
but
he
was
as
well
and
the
easy
life
at
his
great
age
just
suited
him
there
was
enough
to
do
to
prevent
him
from
feeling
idle
but
not
enough
to
tire
him
his
spirit
was
still
hale
i
thinking
of
retiring
he
said
it
about
time
i
gave
the
youngsters
a
chance
he
amused
himself
with
plans
for
the
future
all
his
life
he
had
wanted
to
visit
the
west
indies
and
upon
his
soul
he
meant
to
now
by
george
sir
he
could
afford
to
leave
it
much
longer
england
well
from
all
he
heard
england
was
no
place
for
a
gentleman
nowadays
he
was
last
there
thirty
years
ago
besides
he
was
english
he
was
born
in
ireland
yes
sir
he
took
his
degree
at
trinity
college
dublin
but
what
with
the
priests
on
one
side
and
the
sinn
feiners
on
the
other
he
could
not
believe
there
was
much
left
of
the
ireland
he
knew
as
a
boy
a
fine
country
to
hunt
in
he
said
with
a
gleam
in
his
open
blue
eyes
he
had
better
manners
than
are
usually
found
in
the
medical
profession
which
though
blest
with
many
virtues
neglects
somewhat
the
amenities
of
polite
behaviour
i
do
not
know
whether
it
is
commerce
with
the
sick
which
gives
the
doctor
an
unfortunate
sense
of
superiority
the
example
of
his
teachers
some
of
whom
have
still
a
bad
tradition
of
rudeness
which
certain
eminent
practitioners
of
the
past
cultivated
as
a
professional
asset
or
his
early
training
among
the
poor
patients
of
a
hospital
whom
he
is
apt
to
look
upon
as
of
a
lower
class
than
himself
but
it
is
certain
that
no
body
of
men
is
on
the
whole
so
wanting
in
civility
he
was
very
different
from
the
men
of
my
generation
but
whether
the
difference
lay
in
his
voice
and
gesture
in
the
ease
of
his
manner
or
in
the
elaborateness
of
his
antique
courtesy
it
was
not
easy
to
discover
i
think
he
was
more
definitely
a
gentleman
than
people
are
nowadays
when
a
man
is
a
gentleman
with
deprecation
the
word
is
in
bad
odour
and
the
qualities
it
denotes
have
come
in
for
a
deal
of
ridicule
persons
who
by
no
stretch
of
the
fancy
could
be
so
described
have
made
a
great
stir
in
the
world
during
the
last
thirty
years
and
they
have
used
all
the
resources
of
their
sarcasm
to
render
odious
a
title
which
they
are
perhaps
all
too
conscious
of
never
deserving
perhaps
also
the
difference
in
him
was
due
to
a
difference
of
education
in
his
youth
he
had
been
taught
much
useless
learning
the
classics
of
greece
and
rome
and
they
had
given
a
foundation
to
his
character
which
in
the
present
is
somewhat
rare
he
was
young
in
an
age
which
did
not
know
the
weekly
press
and
when
the
monthly
magazine
was
a
staid
affair
reading
was
more
solid
perhaps
men
drank
more
than
was
good
for
them
but
they
read
horace
for
pleasure
and
they
knew
by
heart
the
novels
of
sir
walter
scott
he
remembered
reading
when
it
came
out
i
think
the
men
of
that
time
were
if
not
more
adventurous
than
the
men
of
ours
more
adventurous
in
the
grand
manner
now
a
man
will
risk
his
life
with
a
joke
from
on
his
lips
then
it
was
with
a
latin
quotation
but
how
can
i
analyse
the
subtle
quality
which
distinguished
this
old
man
read
a
page
of
swift
the
words
are
the
same
as
those
we
use
and
there
is
hardly
a
sentence
in
which
they
are
not
placed
in
the
simplest
order
and
yet
there
is
a
dignity
a
spaciousness
an
aroma
which
all
our
modern
effort
fails
to
attain
in
short
there
is
style
and
so
with
him
there
was
style
and
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
xxvi
rain
yes
but
the
sun
does
not
shine
every
day
sometimes
a
cold
rain
beats
down
on
you
and
a
northeast
wind
chills
you
to
the
bone
your
shoes
and
your
coat
are
wet
still
from
the
day
before
and
you
have
three
hours
to
go
before
breakfast
you
tramp
along
in
the
cheerless
light
of
that
bitter
dawn
with
thirty
miles
before
you
and
nothing
to
look
forward
to
at
the
end
but
the
squalid
discomfort
of
a
chinese
inn
there
you
will
find
bare
walls
a
clammy
floor
of
trodden
earth
and
you
will
dry
yourself
as
best
you
can
over
a
dish
of
burning
charcoal
then
you
think
of
your
pleasant
room
in
london
the
rain
driving
in
squalls
against
the
windows
only
makes
its
warmth
more
grateful
you
sit
by
the
fire
your
pipe
in
your
mouth
and
read
the
from
cover
to
cover
not
the
leading
articles
of
course
but
the
agony
column
and
the
advertisements
of
country
houses
you
will
never
be
able
to
afford
on
the
chiltern
hills
standing
in
its
own
park
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
acres
with
spacious
garden
orchard
a
georgian
house
in
perfect
condition
with
original
woodwork
and
chimney
pieces
six
reception
rooms
fourteen
bedrooms
and
usual
offices
modern
sanitation
stabling
with
rooms
over
and
excellent
garage
three
miles
from
first
rate
golf
course
i
know
then
that
knight
frank
and
rutley
are
my
favourite
authors
the
matters
that
they
treat
of
like
the
great
commonplaces
which
are
the
material
of
all
fine
poetry
never
stale
and
their
manner
like
that
of
the
best
masters
is
characteristic
but
at
the
same
time
various
their
style
as
is
that
of
confucius
according
to
the
sinologues
is
glitteringly
compact
succinct
but
suggestive
it
combines
an
admirable
exactness
with
a
breadth
of
image
which
gives
the
imagination
an
agreeable
freedom
their
mastery
of
words
such
as
rood
and
perch
of
which
i
suppose
i
once
knew
the
meaning
but
which
for
many
years
have
been
a
mystery
to
me
is
amazing
and
they
will
use
them
with
ease
and
assurance
they
can
play
with
technical
terms
with
the
ingenuity
of
rudyard
kipling
and
they
can
invest
them
with
the
celtic
glamour
of
yeats
they
have
combined
their
individualities
so
completely
that
i
defy
the
most
discerning
critic
to
discover
traces
of
a
divided
authorship
literary
history
is
acquainted
with
the
collaboration
of
two
writers
and
the
names
of
beaumont
and
fletcher
erckman
chatrian
besant
and
rice
spring
to
the
excited
fancy
but
now
that
the
higher
criticism
has
destroyed
that
belief
in
the
triple
authorship
of
the
bible
which
i
was
taught
in
my
youth
i
conjecture
that
the
case
of
knight
frank
and
rutley
is
unique
then
elizabeth
very
smart
in
the
white
squirrel
i
brought
her
from
china
comes
in
to
say
to
me
for
she
poor
child
must
go
out
whatever
the
weather
and
i
play
trains
with
her
while
her
pram
is
being
got
ready
then
of
course
i
should
do
a
little
work
but
the
weather
is
so
bad
that
i
feel
lazy
and
i
take
up
instead
professor
giles
book
on
the
rigid
confucianists
frown
upon
him
because
he
is
an
individualist
and
it
is
to
the
individualism
of
the
age
that
they
ascribe
the
lamentable
decay
of
china
but
he
is
very
good
reading
he
has
the
advantage
on
a
rainy
day
that
he
can
be
read
without
great
application
and
not
seldom
you
come
across
a
thought
that
sets
your
own
wandering
but
presently
ideas
insinuating
themselves
into
your
consciousness
like
the
lapping
waves
of
a
rising
tide
absorb
you
to
the
exclusion
of
those
which
old
suggested
and
notwithstanding
your
desire
to
idle
you
sit
down
at
your
table
only
the
dilettante
uses
a
desk
your
pen
goes
easily
and
you
write
without
effort
it
is
very
good
to
be
alive
then
two
amusing
people
come
to
luncheon
and
when
they
are
gone
you
drop
into
christie
you
see
some
ming
figures
there
but
they
are
not
so
good
as
those
you
brought
from
china
yourself
and
then
you
watch
being
sold
pictures
you
are
only
too
glad
not
to
possess
you
look
at
your
watch
there
is
pretty
sure
to
be
a
rubber
going
at
the
garrick
and
the
shocking
weather
justifies
you
in
wasting
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
you
can
not
stay
very
late
for
you
have
seats
for
a
first
night
and
you
must
get
home
and
dress
for
an
early
dinner
you
will
be
just
in
time
to
tell
elizabeth
a
little
story
before
she
goes
to
sleep
she
looks
really
very
nice
in
her
pyjamas
with
her
hair
done
up
in
two
plaits
there
is
something
about
a
first
night
which
only
the
satiety
of
the
critic
can
fail
to
be
moved
by
it
is
pleasant
to
see
your
friends
and
amusing
to
hear
the
pit
applause
when
a
favourite
of
the
stage
acting
better
than
she
ever
does
behind
the
footlights
a
delightful
embarrassment
at
being
recognised
advances
to
take
her
seat
it
may
be
a
bad
play
that
you
are
going
to
see
but
it
has
at
least
the
merit
that
no
one
has
seen
it
before
and
there
is
always
the
chance
of
a
moment
emotion
or
of
a
smile
towards
you
in
their
great
straw
hats
like
the
hat
of
pierrot
but
with
a
huge

sullivan
he
was
an
irish
sailor
he
deserted
his
ship
at
and
took
it
into
his
head
to
walk
across
china
he
spent
three
years
wandering
about
the
country
and
soon
acquired
a
very
good
knowledge
of
chinese
he
learned
it
as
is
common
among
men
of
his
class
with
greater
ease
than
do
the
more
highly
educated
he
lived
on
his
wits
he
made
a
point
of
avoiding
the
british
consul
but
went
to
the
magistrate
of
each
town
he
came
to
and
represented
himself
as
having
been
robbed
on
the
way
of
all
his
money
his
story
was
not
improbable
and
it
was
told
with
a
wealth
of
convincing
detail
which
would
have
excited
the
admiration
of
so
great
a
master
as
captain
costigan
the
magistrate
after
the
chinese
fashion
was
anxious
to
get
rid
of
him
and
was
glad
to
do
so
at
the
cost
of
ten
or
fifteen
dollars
if
he
could
get
no
money
he
could
generally
count
on
a
place
to
sleep
in
and
a
good
meal
he
had
a
certain
rough
humour
which
appealed
to
the
chinese
so
he
continued
very
successfully
till
he
hit
by
misfortune
on
a
magistrate
of
a
different
stamp
this
man
when
he
told
his
story
said
to
him
you
are
nothing
but
a
beggar
and
a
vagabond
you
must
be
beaten
he
gave
an
order
and
the
fellow
was
promptly
taken
out
thrown
on
the
ground
and
soundly
thrashed
he
was
not
only
very
much
hurt
but
exceedingly
surprised
and
what
is
more
strangely
mortified
it
ruined
his
nerve
there
and
then
he
gave
up
his
vagrant
life
and
making
his
way
to
one
of
the
applied
to
the
commissioner
of
customs
for
a
place
as
it
is
not
easy
to
find
white
men
to
take
such
posts
and
few
questions
are
asked
of
those
who
seek
them
he
was
given
a
job
and
you
may
see
him
now
a
man
of
florid
and
rather
stout
in
a
neat
blue
uniform
boarding
the
steamers
and
the
junks
at
a
little
riverside
town
where
the
the
postmaster
a
missionary
and
he
are
the
only
europeans
his
knowledge
of
the
chinese
and
their
ways
makes
him
an
invaluable
servant
he
has
a
little
yellow
wife
and
four
children
he
has
no
shame
about
his
past
and
over
a
good
stiff
whisky
he
will
tell
you
the
whole
story
of
his
adventurous
travels
but
the
beating
is
what
he
can
never
get
over
it
surprises
him
yet
and
he
can
not
he
simply
can
not
understand
it
he
has
no
towards
the
magistrate
who
ordered
it
on
the
contrary
it
appeals
to
his
sense
of
humour
he
was
a
great
old
sportsman
the
old
blackguard
he
says
nerve

the
it
was
an
immense
room
in
an
immense
house
when
it
was
built
building
was
cheap
and
the
merchant
princes
of
that
day
built
magnificently
money
was
made
easily
then
and
life
was
luxurious
it
was
not
hard
to
make
a
fortune
and
a
man
almost
before
he
had
reached
middle
age
could
return
to
england
and
live
the
rest
of
his
days
no
less
splendidly
in
a
fine
house
in
surrey
it
is
true
that
the
population
was
hostile
and
it
was
always
possible
that
a
riot
might
make
it
necessary
for
him
to
fly
for
his
life
but
this
only
added
a
spice
to
the
comfort
of
his
existence
and
when
danger
threatened
it
was
fairly
certain
that
a
gunboat
would
arrive
in
time
to
offer
protection
or
refuge
the
foreign
community
largely
allied
by
marriage
was
sociable
and
its
members
entertained
one
another
lavishly
they
gave
pompous
dinner
parties
they
danced
together
and
they
played
whist
work
was
not
so
pressing
that
it
was
impossible
to
spend
now
and
again
a
few
days
in
the
interior
shooting
duck
it
was
certainly
very
hot
in
summer
and
after
a
few
years
a
man
was
apt
to
take
things
easily
but
the
rest
of
the
year
was
only
warm
with
blue
skies
and
a
balmy
air
and
life
was
very
pleasant
there
was
a
certain
liberty
of
behaviour
and
no
one
was
thought
the
worse
of
so
long
as
the
matter
was
not
intruded
on
the
notice
of
the
ladies
if
he
had
to
live
with
him
a
little
chinese
girl
when
he
married
he
sent
her
away
with
a
present
and
if
there
were
children
they
were
provided
for
at
a
eurasian
school
in
shanghai
but
this
agreeable
life
was
a
thing
of
the
past
the
port
lived
on
its
export
of
tea
and
the
change
of
taste
from
chinese
to
ceylon
had
ruined
it
for
thirty
years
the
port
had
lain
before
that
the
consul
had
had
two
to
help
him
in
his
work
but
now
he
was
able
to
do
it
easily
by
himself
he
generally
managed
to
get
a
game
of
golf
in
the
afternoon
and
he
was
seldom
too
busy
for
a
rubber
of
bridge
nothing
remained
of
the
old
splendour
but
the
enormous
hongs
and
they
were
mostly
empty
the
tea
merchants
such
as
were
left
of
them
turned
their
hands
to
all
manner
of
side
lines
in
the
effort
to
make
both
ends
meet
but
the
effort
was
listless
everyone
in
the
port
seemed
old
it
was
no
place
for
a
young
man
and
in
the
room
in
which
i
sat
i
seemed
to
read
the
history
of
the
past
and
the
history
of
the
man
i
was
awaiting
it
was
sunday
morning
and
when
i
arrived
after
two
days
on
a
coasting
steamer
he
was
in
church
i
tried
to
construct
a
portrait
of
him
from
the
room
there
was
something
pathetic
about
it
it
had
the
magnificence
of
a
past
generation
but
a
magnificence
run
to
seed
and
its
tidiness
i
know
not
why
seemed
to
emphasize
a
poverty
on
the
floor
was
a
huge
turkey
carpet
which
in
the
seventies
must
have
cost
a
great
deal
of
money
but
now
it
was
quite
threadbare
the
immense
mahogany
table
at
which
so
many
good
dinners
had
been
eaten
with
such
a
luxury
of
wine
was
so
highly
polished
that
you
could
see
your
face
in
it

suggested

old
and
tawny

gentlemen
with

the
antics
of
the
mountebank
disraeli
the
walls
were
of
that
sombre
red
which
was
thought
suitable
for
a
dining
room
when
dinner
was
a
respectable
function
and
they
were
heavy
with
pictures
here
were
the
father
and
mother
of
my
host
an
elderly
gentleman
with
grey
whiskers
and
a
bald
head
and

stern
dark

with
her
hair
dressed
in
the
fashion
of
the

his
grandfather
in

his
grandmother
in

sideboard
with

at

with

much
else

in
the
middle
of
the
dining
table
stood
an
immense
épergne
on
the
black
marble
chimney
piece
was
a
black
marble
clock
flanked
by
black
marble
vases
and
in
the
four
corners

were
cabinets
filled
with
all
manner

plated
articles

and
there
great
palms
in
pots
spread
their
stiff
foliage
the
chairs
were
of
massive
mahogany
stuffed
and
covered
with
faded
red
leather
and
on
each
side
of
the
fireplace
was
an
the
room
large
though
it
was
seemed
crowded
but
because
everything
was
rather
shabby
it
gave
you
an
impression
of
melancholy
all
those
things
seemed
to
have
a
sad
life
of
their
own
but
a
life
subdued
as
though
the
force
of
circumstances
had
proved
too
much
for
them
they
had
no
longer
the
strength
to
struggle
against
fate
but
they
clung
together
with
a
tremulous
eagerness
as
though
they
had
a
vague
feeling
that
only
so
could
they
retain
their
significance
and
i
felt
that
it
was
only
a
little
time
before
the
end
came
when
they
would
lie
haphazard
in
an
unlovely
confusion
with
little
numbers
pasted
on
them

dreary
coldness

xxx
the
consul
pete
was
in
a
state
of
the
liveliest
exasperation
he
had
been
in
the
consular
service
for
more
than
twenty
years
and
he
had
had
to
deal
with
all
manner
of
vexatious
people
officials
who
would
not
listen
to
reason
merchants
who
took
the
british
government
for
a
debt
collecting
agency
missionaries
who
resented
as
gross
injustice
any
attempt
at
fair
play
but
he
never
recollected
a
case
which
had
left
him
more
completely
at
a
loss
he
was
a
man
but
for
no
reason
he
flew
into
a
passion
with
his
writer
and
he
very
nearly
sacked
the
eurasian
clerk
because
he
had
wrongly
spelt
two
words
in
a
letter
placed
before
him
for
his
official
signature
he
was
a
conscientious
man
and
he
could
not
persuade
himself
to
leave
his
office
before
the
clock
struck
four
but
the
moment
it
did
he
jumped
up
and
called
for
his
hat
and
stick
because
his
boy
did
not
bring
them
at
once
he
abused
him
roundly
they
say
that
the
consuls
all
grow
a
little
odd
and
the
merchants
who
can
live
for
years
in
china
without
learning
enough
of
the
language
to
ask
their
way
in
the
street
say
that
it
is
because
they
have
to
study
chinese
and
there
was
no
doubt
that
pete
was
decidedly
odd
he
was
a
bachelor
and
on
that
account
had
been
sent
to
a
series
of
posts
which
by
reason
of
their
isolation
were
thought
unsuited
to
married
men
he
had
lived
so
much
alone
that
his
natural
tendency
to
eccentricity
had
developed
to
an
extravagant
degree
and
he
had
habits
which
surprised
the
stranger
he
was
very
he
paid
no
attention
to
his
house
which
was
always
in
great
disorder
nor
to
his
food
his
boys
gave
him
to
eat
what
they
liked
and
for
everything
he
had
made
him
pay
through
the
nose
he
was
untiring
in
his
efforts
to
suppress
the
opium
traffic
but
he
was
the
only
person
in
the
city
who
did
not
know
that
his
servants
kept
opium
in
the
consulate
itself
and
a
busy
traffic
in
the
drug
was
openly
conducted
at
the
back
door
of
the
compound
he
was
an
ardent
collector
and
the
house
provided
for
him
by
the
government
was
filled
with
the
various
things
which
he
had
collected
one
after
the
other
pewter
brass
carved
wood
these
were
his
more
legitimate
enterprises
but
he
also
collected
stamps
birds
eggs
hotel
labels
and
postmarks
he
boasted
that
he
had
a
collection
of
postmarks
which
was
unequalled
in
the
empire
during
his
long
sojourning
in
lonely
places
he
had
read
a
great
deal
and
though
he
was
no
sinologue
he
had
a
greater
knowledge
of
china
its
history
literature
and
people
than
most
of
his
colleagues
but
from
his
wide
reading
he
had
acquired
not
toleration
but
vanity
he
was
a
man
of
a
singular
appearance
his
body
was
small
and
frail
and
when
he
walked
he
gave
you
the
idea
of
a
dead
leaf
dancing
before
the
wind
and
then
there
was
something
extraordinarily
odd
in
the
small
tyrolese
hat
with
a
cock
feather
in
it
very
old
and
shabby
which
he
wore
perched
rakishly
on
the
side
of
his
large
head
he
was
exceedingly
bald
you
saw
that
his
eyes
blue
and
pale
were
weak
behind
the
spectacles
and
a
drooping
ragged
dingy
moustache
did
not
hide
the
peevishness
of
his
mouth
and
now
turning
out
of
the
street
in
which
was
the
consulate
he
made
his
way
on
to
the
city
wall
for
there
only
in
the
multitudinous
city
was
it
possible
to
walk
with
comfort
he
was
a
man
who
took
his
work
hardly
worrying
himself
to
death
over
every
trifle
but
as
a
rule
a
walk
on
the
wall
soothed
and
rested
him
the
city
stood
in
the
midst
of
a
great
plain
and
often
at
sundown
from
the
wall
you
could
see
in
the
distance
the
mountains
the
mountains
of
tibet
but
now
he
walked
quickly
looking
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
and
his
fat
spaniel
frisked
about
him
unobserved
he
talked
to
himself
rapidly
in
a
low
monotone
the
cause
of
his
irritation
was
a
visit
that
he
had
that
day
received
from
a
lady
who
called
herself
yü
and
whom
he
with
a
consular
passion
for
precision
insisted
on
calling
miss
lambert
this
in
itself
sufficed
to
deprive
their
intercourse
of
amenity
she
was
an
englishwoman
married
to
a
chinese
she
had
arrived
two
years
before
with
her
husband
from
england
where
he
had
been
studying
at
the
university
of
london
he
had
made
her
believe
that
he
was
a
great
personage
in
his
own
country
and
she
had
imagined
herself
to
be
coming
to
a
gorgeous
palace
and
a
position
of
consequence
it
was
a
bitter
surprise
when
she
found
herself
brought
to
a
shabby
chinese
house
crowded
with
people
there
was
not
even
a
foreign
bed
in
it
nor
a
knife
and
fork
everything
seemed
to
her
very
dirty
and
smelly
it
was
a
shock
to
find
that
she
had
to
live
with
her
husband
father
and
mother
and
he
told
her
that
she
must
do
exactly
what
his
mother
bade
her
but
in
her
complete
ignorance
of
chinese
it
was
not
till
she
had
been
two
or
three
days
in
the
house
that
she
realised
that
she
was
not
her
husband
only
wife
he
had
been
married
as
a
boy
before
he
left
his
native
city
to
acquire
the
knowledge
of
the
barbarians
when
she
bitterly
upbraided
him
for
deceiving
her
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
a
chinese
from
having
two
wives
if
he
wanted
them
and
he
added
with
some
disregard
to
truth
no
chinese
woman
looked
upon
it
as
a
hardship
it
was
upon
making
this
discovery
that
she
paid
her
first
visit
to
the
consul
he
had
already
heard
of
her
arrival
in
china
everyone
knows
everything
about
everyone
and
he
received
her
without
surprise
nor
had
he
much
sympathy
to
show
her
that
a
foreign
woman
should
marry
a
chinese
at
all
filled
him
with
indignation
but
that
she
should
do
so
without
making
proper
inquiries
vexed
him
like
a
personal
affront
she
was
not
at
all
the
sort
of
woman
whose
appearance
led
you
to
imagine
that
she
would
be
guilty
of
such
a
folly
she
was
a
solid
young
person
short
plain
and
matter
of
fact
she
was
cheaply
dressed
in
a
suit
and
she
wore
a
she
had
bad
teeth
and
a
muddy
skin
her
hands
were
large
and
red
and
ill
cared
for
you
could
tell
that
she
was
not
unused
to
hard
work
she
spoke
english
with
a
cockney
whine
how
did
you
meet
mr
yü
asked
the
consul
frigidly
well
you
see
it
like
this
she
answered
dad
was
in
a
very
good
position
and
when
he
died
mother
said
it
seems
a
sinful
waste
to
keep
all
these
rooms
empty
i
put
a
card
in
the
window
the
consul
interrupted
her
he
had
lodgings
with
you
well
they
were
exactly
lodgings
she
said
shall
we
say
apartments
then
replied
the
consul
with
his
thin
slightly
vain
smile
that
was
generally
the
explanation
of
these
marriages
then
because
he
thought
her
a
very
foolish
vulgar
woman
he
explained
bluntly
that
according
to
english
law
she
was
not
married
to
yü
and
that
the
best
thing
she
could
do
was
to
go
back
to
england
at
once
she
began
to
cry
and
his
heart
softened
a
little
to
her
he
promised
to
put
her
in
charge
of
some
missionary
ladies
who
would
look
after
her
on
the
long
journey
and
indeed
if
she
liked
he
would
see
if
meanwhile
she
could
not
live
in
one
of
the
missions
but
while
he
talked
miss
lambert
dried
her
tears
what
the
good
of
going
back
to
england
she
said
at
last
i
got
nowhere
to
go
to
you
can
go
to
your
mother
she
was
all
against
my
marrying
yü
i
should
never
hear
the
last
of
it
if
i
was
to
go
back
now
the
consul
began
to
argue
with
her
but
the
more
he
argued
the
more
determined
she
became
and
at
last
he
lost
his
temper
if
you
like
to
stay
here
with
a
man
who
is
your
husband
it
your
own
look
out
but
i
wash
my
hands
of
all
responsibility
her
retort
had
often
rankled
then
you
got
no
cause
to
worry
she
said
and
the
look
on
her
face
returned
to
him
whenever
he
thought
of
her
that
was
two
years
ago
and
he
had
seen
her
once
or
twice
since
then
it
appeared
that
she
got
on
very
badly
both
with
her
and
with
her
husband
other
wife
and
she
had
come
to
the
consul
with
preposterous
questions
about
her
rights
according
to
chinese
law
he
repeated
his
offer
to
get
her
away
but
she
remained
steadfast
in
her
refusal
to
go
and
their
interview
always
ended
in
the
consul
flying
into
a
passion
he
was
almost
inclined
to
pity
the
rascally
yü
who
had
to
keep
the
peace
between
three
warring
women
according
to
his
english
wife
account
he
was
not
unkind
to
her
he
tried
to
act
fairly
by
both
his
wives
miss
lambert
did
not
improve
the
consul
knew
that
ordinarily
she
wore
chinese
clothes
but
when
she
came
to
see
him
she
put
on
european
dress
she
was
become
extremely
blowsy
her
health
suffered
from
the
chinese
food
she
ate
and
she
was
beginning
to
look
wretchedly
ill
but
really
he
was
shocked
when
she
had
been
shown
into
his
office
that
day
she
wore
no
hat
and
her
hair
was
dishevelled
she
was
in
a
highly
hysterical
state
they
trying
to
poison
me
she
screamed
and
she
put
before
him
a
bowl
of
some
foul
smelling
food
it
poisoned
she
said
i
been
ill
for
the
last
ten
days
it
only
by
a
miracle
i
escaped
she
gave
him
a
long
story
circumstantial
and
probable
enough
to
convince
him
after
all
nothing
was
more
likely
than
that
the
chinese
women
should
use
familiar
methods
to
get
rid
of
an
intruder
who
was
hateful
to
them
do
they
know
you
come
here
of
course
they
do
i
told
them
i
was
going
to
show
them
up
now
at
last
was
the
moment
for
decisive
action
the
consul
looked
at
her
in
his
most
official
manner
well
you
must
never
go
back
there
i
refuse
to
put
up
with
your
nonsense
any
longer
i
insist
on
your
leaving
this
man
who
is
your
husband
but
he
found
himself
helpless
against
the
woman
insane
obstinacy
he
repeated
all
the
arguments
he
had
used
so
often
but
she
would
not
listen
and
as
usual
he
lost
his
temper
it
was
then
in
answer
to
his
final
desperate
question
that
she
had
made
the
remark
which
had
entirely
robbed
him
of
his
calm
but
what
on
earth
makes
you
stay
with
the
man
he
cried
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
a
curious
look
came
into
her
eyes
there
something
in
the
way
his
hair
grows
on
his
forehead
that
i
ca
help
liking
she
answered
the
consul
had
never
heard
anything
so
outrageous
it
really
was
the
last
straw
and
now
while
he
strode
along
trying
to
walk
off
his
anger
though
he
was
not
a
man
who
often
used
bad
language
he
really
could
not
restrain
himself
and
he
said
fiercely
women
are
simply
bloody
xxxi
the
stripling
he
walked
along
the
causeway
with
an
easy
confident
stride
he
was
seventeen
tall
and
slim
with
a
smooth
and
yellow
skin
that
had
never
known
a
razor
his
eyes
but
slightly
aslant
were
large
and
open
and
his
full
red
lips
were
tremulous
with
a
smile
the
happy
audacity
of
youth
was
in
his
bearing
his
little
round
cap
was
set
jauntily
on
his
head
his
black
gown
was
girt
about
his
loins
and
his
trousers
as
a
rule
gartered
at
the
ankle
were
turned
up
to
the
knees
he
went
barefoot
but
for
thin
straw
sandals
and
his
feet
were
small
and
shapely
he
had
walked
since
early
morning
along
the
paved
causeway
that
wound
its
sinuous
path
up
the
hills
and
down
into
the
valleys
with
their
innumerable
padi
fields
past
burial
grounds
with
their
serried
dead
through
busy
villages
where
maybe
his
eyes
rested
approvingly
for
a
moment
on
some
pretty
girl
in
her
blue
smock
and
her
short
blue
trousers
sitting
in
an
open
doorway
but
i
think
his
glance
claimed
admiration
rather
than
gave
it
and
now
he
was
nearing
the
end
of
his
journey
and
the
city
whither
he
was
bound
seeking
his
fortune
it
stood
in
the
midst
of
a
fertile
plain
surrounded
by
a
crenellated
wall
and
when
he
saw
it
he
stepped
forward
with
resolution
he
threw
back
his
head
boldly
he
was
proud
of
his
strength
all
his
worldly
goods
were
wrapped
up
in
a
parcel
of
blue
cotton
which
he
carried
over
his
shoulder
now
dick
whittington
setting
out
to
win
fame
and
fortune
had
a
cat
for
his
companion
but
the
chinese
carried
with
him
a
round
cage
with
red
bars
which
he
held
with
a
peculiar
grace
between
finger
and
thumb
and
in
the
cage
was
a
beautiful
green
parrot
xxxii
the
fannings
they
lived
in
a
fine
square
house
with
a
verandah
all
round
it
on
the
top
of
a
low
hill
that
faced
the
river
and
below
them
a
little
to
the
right
was
another
fine
square
house
which
was
the
customs
and
to
this
for
he
was
deputy
commissioner
fanning
went
every
day
the
city
was
five
miles
away
and
on
the
river
bank
was
nothing
but
a
small
village
which
had
sprung
up
to
provide
the
crews
of
junks
with
what
gear
or
food
they
needed
in
the
city
were
a
few
missionaries
but
these
they
saw
seldom
and
the
only
foreigners
in
the
village
besides
themselves
were
the
one
of
these
had
been
an
able
seaman
and
the
other
was
an
italian
they
both
had
chinese
wives
the
fannings
asked
them
to
tiffin
on
christmas
day
and
on
the
king
birthday
but
otherwise
their
relations
with
them
were
purely
official
the
steamers
stayed
but
half
an
hour
so
they
never
saw
the
captains
or
the
chief
engineers
who
were
the
only
white
men
on
them
and
for
five
months
in
the
year
the
water
was
too
low
for
steamers
to
pass
oddly
enough
it
was
then
they
saw
most
foreigners
for
it
happened
now
and
again
that
a
traveller
a
merchant
or
consular
official
perhaps
more
often
a
missionary
going
up
stream
by
junk
tied
up
for
the
night
and
then
the
commissioner
went
down
to
the
river
and
asked
him
to
dine
they
lived
very
much
alone
fanning
was
extremely
bald
a
short
thickset
man
with
a
snub
nose
and
a
very
black
moustache
he
was
a
martinet
aggressive
brusque
with
a
bullying
manner
and
he
never
spoke
to
a
chinese
without
raising
his
voice
to
a
tone
of
rasping
command
though
he
spoke
fluent
chinese
when
one
of
his
boys
did
something
to
displease
him
he
abused
him
roundly
in
english
he
made
a
disagreeable
impression
on
you
till
you
discovered
that
his
aggressiveness
was
merely
an
armour
put
on
to
conceal
a
painful
shyness
it
was
a
triumph
of
his
will
over
his
disposition
his
gruffness
was
an
almost
absurd
attempt
to
persuade
those
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
that
he
was
not
frightened
of
them
you
felt
that
no
one
was
more
surprised
than
himself
that
he
was
taken
seriously
he
was
like
those
little
grotesque
figures
that
children
blow
out
like
balloons
and
you
had
an
idea
that
he
went
in
lively
fear
of
bursting
and
then
everyone
would
see
that
he
was
but
a
hollow
bladder
it
was
his
wife
who
was
constantly
alert
to
persuade
him
that
he
was
a
man
of
iron
and
when
the
explosion
was
over
she
would
say
to
him
you
know
you
frighten
me
when
you
get
in
those
passions
or
i
think
i
better
say
something
to
the
boy
he
quite
shaken
by
what
you
said
then
fanning
would
puff
himself
up
and
smile
indulgently
when
a
visitor
came
she
would
say
the
chinese
are
terrified
of
my
husband
but
of
course
they
respect
him
they
know
it
no
good
trying
any
of
their
nonsense
with
him
well
i
ought
to
know
how
to
treat
them
he
would
answer
with
beetling
brows
i
been
over
twenty
years
in
the
country
fanning
was
a
little
plain
woman
wizened
like
a
with
a
big
nose
and
bad
teeth
she
was
always
very
untidy
her
hair
going
a
little
grey
was
continually
on
the
point
of
falling
down
now
and
then
in
the
midst
of
conversation
she
would
abstractedly
take
out
a
pin
or
two
give
it
a
shake
and
without
troubling
to
look
in
the
glass
insecurely
fix
its
few
thin
wisps
she
had
a
love
of
brilliant
colour
and
she
wore
fantastic
clothes
which
she
and
the
sewing
amah
ran
up
together
from
the
fashion
papers
but
when
she
dressed
she
could
never
find
anything
that
went
with
anything
else
and
she
looked
like
a
woman
who
had
been
rescued
from
shipwreck
and
clothed
in
any
oddments
that
could
be
found
she
was
a
caricature
and
you
could
not
help
smiling
when
you
looked
at
her
the
only
attractive
thing
she
had
was
a
soft
and
extremely
musical
voice
and
she
spoke
with
a
little
drawl
which
came
from
i
know
not
what
part
of
england
the
fannings
had
two
sons
one
of
nine
and
one
of
seven
and
they
completed
the
solitary
household
they
were
attractive
children
affectionate
and
demonstrative
and
it
was
pleasant
to
see
how
united
the
family
was
they
had
little
jokes
together
that
amused
them
hugely
and
they
played
pranks
with
one
another
as
though
not
one
of
them
was
more
than
ten
though
they
had
so
much
of
one
another
society
it
really
looked
as
though
they
could
not
bear
to
be
out
of
one
another
sight
and
each
day
when
fanning
went
to
his
office
his
boys
would
hardly
let
him
go
and
each
day
when
he
returned
they
greeted
him
with
extravagant
delight
they
had
no
fear
of
his
gruff
bluster
and
presently
you
discovered
that
the
centre
of
this
concord
was
that
little
grotesque
ugly
woman
it
was
not
chance
that
kept
the
family
united
nor
peculiarly
agreeable
dispositions
but
a
passion
of
love
in
her
from
the
moment
she
got
up
in
the
morning
till
the
time
she
went
to
bed
her
thoughts
were
occupied
with
the
welfare
of
the
three
male
persons
who
were
in
her
charge
her
active
mind
was
busy
all
the
time
with
schemes
for
their
happiness
i
do
not
think
a
thought
of
self
ever
entered
her
untidy
head
she
was
a
miracle
of
unselfishness
it
was
really
hardly
human
she
never
had
a
hard
word
for
anyone
she
was
very
hospitable
and
it
was
she
who
caused
her
husband
to
go
down
to
the
houseboats
and
invite
travellers
to
come
up
to
dinner
but
i
do
not
think
she
wanted
them
for
her
own
sake
she
was
quite
happy
in
her
solitude
but
she
thought
her
husband
enjoyed
a
talk
with
strangers
i
do
want
him
to
get
in
a
rut
she
said
my
poor
husband
he
misses
his
billiards
and
his
bridge
it
very
hard
for
a
man
to
have
no
one
to
talk
to
but
a
woman
every
evening
when
the
children
had
been
put
to
bed
they
played
piquet
she
had
no
head
for
cards
poor
dear
and
she
always
made
mistakes
but
when
her
husband
upbraided
her
she
said
you
ca
expect
everyone
to
be
as
clever
as
you
are
and
because
she
so
obviously
meant
what
she
said
he
could
not
find
it
in
his
heart
to
be
angry
with
her
then
when
the
commissioner
was
tired
of
beating
her
they
would
turn
on
the
gramophone
and
sitting
side
by
side
listen
in
silence
to
the
latest
songs
from
the
musical
comedies
of
london
you
may
turn
up
your
nose
they
lived
ten
thousand
miles
away
from
england
and
it
was
their
only
tie
with
the
home
they
loved
it
made
them
feel
not
quite
so
utterly
cut
off
from
civilisation
and
presently
they
would
talk
of
what
they
would
do
with
the
children
when
they
grew
up
soon
it
would
be
time
to
send
them
home
to
school
and
perhaps
a
pang
passed
through
the
little
woman
gentle
heart
it
be
hard
for
you
bertie
when
they
go
she
said
but
perhaps
we
shall
be
moved
then
to
some
place
where
there
a
club
and
then
you
be
able
to
go
and
play
bridge
in
the
evenings
xxxiii
the
song
of
the
river
you
hear
it
all
along
the
river
you
hear
it
loud
and
strong
from
the
rowers
as
they
urge
the
junk
with
its
high
stern
the
mast
lashed
alongside
down
the
swift
running
stream
you
hear
it
from
the
trackers
a
more
breathless
chaunt
as
they
pull
desperately
against
the
current
half
a
dozen
of
them
perhaps
if
they
are
taking
up
a
wupan
a
couple
of
hundred
if
they
are
hauling
a
splendid
junk
its
square
sail
set
over
a
rapid
on
the
junk
a
man
stands
amidships
beating
a
drum
incessantly
to
guide
their
efforts
and
they
pull
with
all
their
strength
like
men
possessed
bent
double
and
sometimes
in
the
extremity
of
their
travail
they
crawl
on
the
ground
on
all
fours
like
the
beasts
of
the
field
they
strain
strain
fiercely
against
the
pitiless
might
of
the
stream
the
leader
goes
up
and
down
the
line
and
when
he
sees
one
who
is
not
putting
all
his
will
into
the
task
he
brings
down
his
split
bamboo
on
the
naked
back
each
one
must
do
his
utmost
or
the
labour
of
all
is
vain
and
still
they
sing
a
vehement
eager
chaunt
the
chaunt
of
the
turbulent
waters
i
do
not
know
how
words
can
describe
what
there
is
in
it
of
effort
it
serves
to
express
the
straining
heart
the
breaking
muscles
and
at
the
same
time
the
indomitable
spirit
of
man
which
overcomes
the
pitiless
force
of
nature
though
the
rope
may
part
and
the
great
junk
swing
back
in
the
end
the
rapid
will
be
passed
and
at
the
close
of
the
weary
day
there
is
the
hearty
meal
and
perhaps
the
opium
pipe
with
its
dreams
of
ease
but
the
most
agonising
song
is
the
song
of
the
coolies
who
bring
the
great
bales
from
the
junk
up
the
steep
steps
to
the
town
wall
up
and
down
they
go
endlessly
and
endless
as
their
toil
rises
their
rhythmic
cry
he
aw
ah
oh
they
are
barefoot
and
naked
to
the
waist
the
sweat
pours
down
their
faces
and
their
song
is
a
groan
of
pain
it
is
a
sigh
of
despair
it
is
it
is
hardly
human
it
is
the
cry
of
souls
in
infinite
distress
only
just
musical
and
that
last
note
is
the
ultimate
sob
of
humanity
life
is
too
hard
too
cruel
and
this
is
the
final
despairing
protest
that
is
the
song
of
the
river
xxxiv
mirage
he
is
a
tall
man
with
bulging
sky
blue
eyes
and
an
embarrassed
manner
he
looks
as
though
he
were
a
little
too
large
for
his
skin
and
you
feel
that
he
would
be
more
comfortable
if
it
were
a
trifle
looser
his
hair
very
smooth
and
crisp
fits
so
tightly
on
his
head
that
it
gives
you
the
impression
of
a
wig
and
you
have
an
almost
irresistible
inclination
to
pull
it
he
has
no
small
talk
he
hunts
for
topics
of
conversation
and
racking
his
brain
to
no
purpose
in
desperation
offers
you
a
whisky
and
soda
he
is
in
charge
of
the
and
the
building
in
which
he
lives
is
office
godown
and
residence
all
in
one
his
parlour
is
furnished
with
a
suite
of
dingy
upholstered
furniture
placed
neatly
round
the
walls
and
in
the
middle
is
a
round
table
a
hanging
petroleum
lamp
gives
a
melancholy
light
and
an
oil
stove
heat
in
appropriate
places
are
richly
framed
oleographs
from
the
christmas
numbers
of
american
magazines
but
he
does
not
sit
in
this
room
he
spends
his
leisure
in
his
bedroom
in
america
he
has
always
lived
in
a
boarding
house
where
his
bedroom
was
the
only
privacy
he
knew
and
he
has
gotten
the
habit
of
living
in
one
it
seems
unnatural
to
him
to
sit
in
a
he
does
not
like
to
take
his
coat
off
and
he
only
feels
at
home
in
shirt
sleeves
he
keeps
his
books
and
his
private
papers
in
his
bedroom
he
has
a
desk
and
a
rocking
chair
there
he
has
lived
in
china
for
five
years
but
he
knows
no
chinese
and
takes
no
interest
in
the
race
among
whom
in
all
likelihood
the
best
years
of
his
life
will
be
spent
his
business
is
done
through
an
interpreter
and
his
house
is
managed
by
a
boy
now
and
then
he
takes
a
journey
of
several
hundred
miles
into
mongolia
a
wild
and
rugged
country
either
in
chinese
carts
or
on
ponies
and
he
sleeps
at
the
wayside
inns
where
congregate
merchants
drovers
herdsmen
men
at
arms
ruffians
and
wild
fellows
the
people
of
the
land
are
turbulent
when
there
is
unrest
he
is
exposed
to
not
a
little
risk
but
these
are
purely
business
undertakings
they
bore
him
he
is
always
glad
to
get
back
to
his
familiar
bedroom
at
the
for
he
is
a
great
reader
he
reads
nothing
but
american
magazines
and
the
number
of
those
he
has
sent
to
him
by
every
mail
is
amazing
he
never
throws
them
away
and
there
are
piles
of
them
all
over
the
house
the
city
in
which
he
lives
is
the
gateway
into
china
from
mongolia
there
dwell
the
teeming
chinese
and
through
its
gates
pass
constantly
the
mongols
with
their
caravans
of
camels
endless
processions
of
carts
drawn
by
oxen
which
have
brought
hides
from
the
illimitable
distances
of
asia
rumble
noisily
through
its
crowded
streets
he
is
bored
it
has
never
occurred
to
him
that
he
lives
a
life
in
which
the
possibility
of
adventure
is
at
his
doors
he
can
only
recognise
it
through
the
printed
page
and
it
needs
a
story
of
in
texas
or
nevada
of
hairbreadth
escape
in
the
south
seas
to
stir
his
blood
xxxv
the
stranger
it
was
a
comfort
in
that
sweltering
heat
to
get
out
of
the
city
the
missionary
stepped
out
of
the
launch
in
which
he
had
dropped
leisurely
down
the
river
and
comfortably
settled
himself
in
the
chair
which
was
waiting
for
him
at
the
water
edge
he
was
carried
through
the
village
by
the
river
side
and
began
to
ascend
the
hill
it
was
an
hour
journey
along
a
pathway
of
broad
stone
steps
under
fir
trees
and
now
and
again
you
caught
a
delightful
glimpse
of
the
broad
river
shining
in
the
sun
amid
the
exultant
green
of
the
padi
fields
the
bearers
went
along
with
a
swinging
stride
the
sweat
on
their
backs
shone
it
was
a
sacred
mountain
with
a
buddhist
monastery
on
the
top
of
it
and
on
the
way
up
there
were
rest
houses
where
the
coolies
set
down
the
chair
for
a
few
minutes
and
a
monk
in
his
grey
robe
gave
you
a
cup
of
flowered
tea
the
air
was
fresh
and
sweet
the
pleasure
of
that
lazy
journey
the
swing
of
the
chair
was
very
soothing
made
a
day
in
the
city
almost
worth
while
and
at
the
end
of
it
was
his
trim
little
bungalow
where
he
spent
the
summer
and
before
him
the
night
the
mail
had
come
in
that
day
and
he
was
bringing
on
letters
and
papers
there
were
four
numbers
of
the
evening
and
four
of
the
he
had
nothing
but
pleasant
things
to
look
forward
to
and
the
usual
peace
a
peace
as
he
often
said
which
passeth
all
understanding
which
filled
him
whenever
he
was
among
these
green
trees
away
from
the
teeming
city
should
long
since
have
descended
upon
him
but
he
was
harassed
he
had
had
that
day
an
unfortunate
encounter
and
he
was
unable
trivial
as
it
was
to
put
it
out
of
his
mind
it
was
on
this
account
that
his
face
bore
a
somewhat
peevish
expression
it
was
a
thin
and
sensitive
face
almost
ascetic
with
regular
features
and
intelligent
eyes
he
was
very
long
and
thin
with
the
spindly
legs
of
a
grasshopper
and
as
he
sat
in
his
chair
swaying
a
little
with
the
motion
of
his
bearers
he
reminded
you
somewhat
grotesquely
of
a
faded
lily
a
gentle
creature
he
could
never
have
hurt
a
fly
he
had
run
across
saunders
in
one
of
the
streets
of
the
city
saunders
was
a
little
man
with
a
high
colour
and
a
snub
nose
which
gave
him
a
strangely
impudent
expression
he
had
a
large
sensual
mouth
and
when
he
laughed
which
he
did
very
often
he
showed
decayed
and
discoloured
teeth
when
he
laughed
his
little
blue
eyes
wrinkled
in
a
curious
fashion
and
then
he
looked
the
very
picture
of
malice
there
was
something
faunlike
in
him
his
movements
were
quick
and
unexpected
he
walked
with
a
rapid
trip
as
though
he
were
always
in
a
hurry
he
was
a
doctor
who
lived
in
the
heart
of
the
city
among
the
chinese
he
was
not
on
the
register
but
someone
had
made
it
his
business
to
find
out
that
he
had
been
duly
qualified
he
had
been
struck
off
but
for
what
crime
whether
social
or
purely
professional
none
know
nor
how
he
had
happened
to
come
to
the
east
and
eventually
settle
on
the
china
coast
but
it
was
evident
that
he
was
a
very
clever
doctor
and
the
chinese
had
great
faith
in
him
he
avoided
the
foreigners
and
rather
disagreeable
stories
were
circulated
about
him
everyone
knew
him
to
say
how
do
you
do
to
but
no
one
asked
him
to
his
house
nor
visited
him
in
his
own
when
they
had
met
that
afternoon
saunders
had
exclaimed
what
on
earth
has
brought
you
to
the
city
at
this
time
of
year
i
have
some
business
that
i
could
leave
any
longer
answered
the
missionary
and
then
i
wanted
to
get
the
mail
there
was
a
stranger
here
the
other
day
asking
for
you
said
the
doctor
for
me
cried
the
other
with
surprise
well
not
for
you
particularly
explained
the
doctor
he
wanted
to
know
the
way
to
the
american
mission
i
told
him
but
i
said
he
would
find
anyone
there
he
seemed
rather
surprised
at
that
so
i
told
him
that
you
all
went
up
to
the
hills
in
may
and
did
come
back
till
september
a
foreigner
asked
the
missionary
still
wondering
who
the
stranger
could
be
oh
yes
certainly
the
doctor
eyes
twinkled
then
he
asked
me
about
the
other
missions
i
told
him
the
london
mission
had
a
settlement
here
but
it
was
the
least
use
going
there
as
all
the
missionaries
were
away
in
the
hills
after
all
it
devilish
hot
in
the
city
i
like
to
go
to
one
of
the
mission
schools
said
the
stranger
they
all
closed
i
said
then
i
go
to
the
hospital
well
worth
a
visit
i
said
american
hospital
is
equipped
with
all
the
latest
contrivances
their
operating
theatre
is
perfect
is
the
name
of
the
doctor
in
charge
he
up
in
the
hills
what
about
the
sick
are
no
sick
between
may
and
september
i
said
if
there
are
they
have
to
put
up
with
the
native
dispensers
saunders
paused
for
a
moment
the
missionary
looked
ever
so
slightly
vexed
well
he
said
the
stranger
looked
at
me
irresolutely
for
a
moment
or
two
wanted
to
see
something
of
the
missions
before
i
left
he
said
might
try
the
roman
catholics
i
said
here
all
the
year
round
do
they
take
their
holidays
then
he
asked
do
i
said
he
left
me
at
that
i
think
he
went
to
the
spanish
convent
the
missionary
fell
into
the
trap
and
it
irritated
him
to
think
how
ingenuously
he
had
done
so
he
ought
to
have
seen
what
was
coming
who
was
this
anyway
he
asked
innocently
i
asked
him
his
name
said
the
doctor
i
christ
he
said
the
missionary
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
abruptly
told
his
rickshaw
boy
to
go
on
it
had
put
him
thoroughly
out
of
temper
it
was
so
unjust
of
course
they
went
away
from
may
to
september
the
heat
made
any
useful
activity
quite
out
of
the
question
and
it
had
been
found
by
experience
that
the
missionaries
preserved
their
health
and
strength
much
better
if
they
spent
the
hot
months
in
the
hills
a
sick
missionary
was
only
an
encumbrance
it
was
a
matter
of
practical
politics
and
it
had
been
found
that
the
lord
work
was
done
more
efficiently
if
a
certain
part
of
the
year
was
set
aside
for
rest
and
recreation
and
then
the
reference
to
the
roman
catholics
was
grossly
unfair
they
were
unmarried
they
had
no
families
to
think
of
the
mortality
among
them
was
terrifying
why
in
that
very
city
of
fourteen
nuns
who
had
come
out
to
china
ten
years
ago
all
but
three
were
dead
it
was
perfectly
easy
for
them
because
it
was
more
convenient
for
their
work
to
live
in
the
middle
of
the
city
and
to
stay
there
all
the
year
round
they
had
no
ties
they
had
no
duties
to
those
who
were
near
and
dear
to
them
oh
it
was
grossly
unjust
to
drag
in
the
roman
catholics
but
suddenly
an
idea
flashed
through
his
mind
what
rankled
most
was
that
he
had
left
the
rascally
doctor
you
only
had
to
look
at
his
face
all
puckered
with
malicious
amusement
to
know
he
was
a
rogue
without
a
word
there
certainly
was
an
answer
but
he
had
not
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
make
it
and
now
the
perfect
repartee
occurred
to
him
a
glow
of
satisfaction
filled
him
and
he
almost
fancied
that
he
had
made
it
it
was
a
crushing
rejoinder
and
he
rubbed
his
very
long
thin
hands
with
satisfaction
dear
sir
he
ought
to
have
said
lord
never
in
the
whole
course
of
his
ministry
claimed
to
be
the
christ
it
was
an
unanswerable
snub
and
thinking
of
it
the
missionary
forgot
his
xxxvi
democracy
it
was
a
cold
night
i
had
finished
my
dinner
and
my
boy
was
making
up
my
bed
while
i
sat
over
a
brazier
of
burning
charcoal
most
of
the
coolies
had
already
settled
themselves
for
the
night
in
a
room
next
to
mine
and
through
the
thin
matchboarding
of
the
wall
that
separated
us
i
heard
a
couple
of
them
talk
another
party
of
travellers
had
arrived
about
an
hour
before
and
the
small
inn
was
full
suddenly
there
was
a
commotion
and
going
to
the
door
of
my
room
to
look
out
i
saw
three
sedan
chairs
enter
the
courtyard
they
were
set
down
in
front
of
me
and
from
the
first
stepped
out
a
stout
chinese
of
imposing
aspect
he
wore
a
long
black
robe
of
figured
silk
lined
with
squirrel
and
on
his
head
a
square
fur
cap
he
seemed
taken
aback
when
he
saw
me
at
the
door
of
the
principal
guest
chamber
and
turning
to
the
landlord
addressed
him
in
authoritative
tones
it
appeared
that
he
was
an
official
and
he
was
much
annoyed
to
find
that
the
best
apartment
in
the
inn
was
already
taken
he
was
told
that
but
one
room
was
available
it
was
small
with
pallets
covered
with
tumbled
straw
lining
the
walls
and
was
used
as
a
rule
only
by
coolies
he
flung
into
a
violent
passion
and
on
a
sudden
arose
a
scene
of
the
greatest
animation
the
official
his
two
companions
and
his
bearers
exclaimed
against
the
indignity
which
it
was
sought
to
thrust
upon
him
while
the
landlord
and
the
servants
of
the
inn
argued
expostulated
and
entreated
the
official
stormed
and
threatened
for
a
few
minutes
the
courtyard
so
silent
before
rang
with
the
angry
shouts
then
subsiding
as
quickly
as
it
began
the
hubbub
ceased
and
the
official
went
into
the
vacant
room
hot
water
was
brought
by
a
bedraggled
servant
and
presently
the
landlord
followed
with
great
bowls
of
steaming
rice
all
was
once
more
quiet
an
hour
later
i
went
into
the
yard
to
stretch
my
legs
for
five
minutes
before
going
to
bed
and
somewhat
to
my
surprise
i
came
upon
the
stout
official
a
little
while
ago
so
pompous
and
seated
at
a
table
in
the
front
of
the
inn
with
the
most
ragged
of
my
coolies
they
were
chatting
amicably
and
the
official
quietly
smoked
a
he
had
made
all
that
to
give
himself
face
but
having
achieved
his
object
was
satisfied
and
feeling
the
need
of
conversation
had
accepted
the
company
of
any
coolie
without
a
thought
of
social
distinction
his
manner
was
perfectly
cordial
and
there
was
in
it
no
trace
of
condescension
the
coolie
talked
with
him
on
an
equal
footing
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
was
true
democracy
in
the
east
man
is
equal
in
a
sense
you
find
neither
in
europe
nor
in
america
position
and
wealth
put
a
man
in
a
relation
of
superiority
to
another
that
is
purely
adventitious
and
they
are
no
bar
to
sociability
when
i
lay
in
my
bed
i
asked
myself
why
in
the
despotic
east
there
should
be
between
men
an
equality
so
much
greater
than
in
the
free
and
democratic
west
and
was
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
the
explanation
must
be
sought
in
the
for
in
the
west
we
are
divided
from
our
fellows
by
our
sense
of
smell
the
working
man
is
our
master
inclined
to
rule
us
with
an
iron
hand
but
it
can
not
be
denied
that
he
stinks
none
can
wonder
at
it
for
a
bath
in
the
dawn
when
you
have
to
hurry
to
your
work
before
the
factory
bell
rings
is
no
pleasant
thing
nor
does
heavy
labour
tend
to
sweetness
and
you
do
not
change
your
linen
more
than
you
can
help
when
the
week
washing
must
be
done
by
a
wife
i
do
not
blame
the
working
man
because
he
stinks
but
stink
he
does
it
makes
social
intercourse
difficult
to
persons
of
a
sensitive
nostril
the
matutinal
tub
divides
the
classes
more
effectually
than
birth
wealth
or
education
it
is
very
significant
that
those
novelists
who
have
risen
from
the
ranks
of
labour
are
apt
to
make
it
a
symbol
of
class
prejudice
and
one
of
the
most
distinguished
writers
of
our
day
always
marks
the
rascals
of
his
entertaining
stories
by
the
fact
that
they
take
a
bath
every
morning
now
the
chinese
live
all
their
lives
in
the
proximity
of
very
nasty
smells
they
do
not
notice
them
their
nostrils
are
blunted
to
the
odours
that
assail
the
europeans
and
so
they
can
move
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
tiller
of
the
soil
the
coolie
and
the
artisan
i
venture
to
think
that
the
is
more
necessary
to
democracy
than
parliamentary
institutions
the
invention
of
the
sanitary
convenience
has
destroyed
the
sense
of
equality
in
men
it
is
responsible
for
class
hatred
much
more
than
the
monopoly
of
capital
in
the
hands
of
the
few
it
is
a
tragic
thought
that
the
first
man
who
pulled
the
plug
of
a
with
that
negligent
gesture
rang
the
knell
of
democracy
xxxvii
the
seventh
day
adventist
he
was
a
big
man
and
his
bones
were
well
covered
he
gave
you
the
impression
that
he
had
put
on
flesh
since
he
bought
his
clothes
for
they
seemed
somewhat
tight
for
him
he
always
wore
the
same
things
a
blue
suit
evidently
bought
in
a
department
store
the
lapel
decorated
with
a
small
american
flag
a
high
starched
collar
and
a
white
tie
on
which
was
a
pattern
of
his
short
nose
and
pugnacious
chin
gave
his
face
a
determined
look
his
eyes
behind
large
spectacles
were
large
and
blue
and
his
hair
receding
on
the
temples
lank
and
dull
was
plastered
down
on
his
head
but
on
the
crown
protruded
a
rebellious
cock
feather
he
was
travelling
up
the
yangtze
for
the
first
time
but
he
took
no
interest
in
his
surroundings
he
had
no
eye
for
the
waste
of
turbulent
waters
that
was
spread
before
him
nor
for
the
colours
tragic
or
tender
which
sunrise
and
sunset
lent
the
scene
the
great
junks
with
their
square
white
sails
proceeded
stately
down
the
stream
the
moon
rose
flooding
the
noble
river
with
silver
and
giving
a
strange
magic
to
the
temples
on
the
bank
among
a
grove
of
trees
he
was
frankly
bored
during
a
certain
part
of
the
day
he
studied
chinese
but
for
the
rest
of
the
time
he
read
nothing
but
a
york
three
months
old
and
the
parliamentary
debates
of
july
which
heaven
knows
why
happened
to
be
on
board
he
took
no
interest
in
the
religions
which
flourished
in
the
land
he
had
come
to
evangelise
he
classed
them
all
contemptuously
as
devil
worship
i
do
not
think
he
had
ever
read
the
analects
of
confucius
he
was
ignorant
of
the
history
art
and
literature
of
china
i
could
not
make
out
what
had
brought
him
to
the
country
he
spoke
of
his
work
as
a
profession
which
he
had
entered
as
a
man
might
enter
the
civil
service
and
which
though
it
was
poorly
paid
he
complained
that
he
earned
less
than
an
artisan
he
wanted
notwithstanding
to
make
a
good
job
of
he
wanted
to
increase
his
church
membership
he
wanted
to
make
his
school
if
ever
he
had
had
a
serious
call
to
convert
the
heathen
there
was
in
him
no
trace
of
it
now
he
looked
upon
the
whole
matter
as
a
business
proposition
the
secret
of
success
lay
in
the
precious
word
organization
he
was
upright
honest
and
virtuous
but
there
was
neither
passion
in
him
nor
enthusiasm
he
seemed
to
be
under
the
impression
that
the
chinese
were
very
simple
people
and
because
they
did
not
know
the
same
things
that
he
did
he
thought
them
ignorant
he
could
not
help
showing
that
he
looked
upon
himself
as
superior
to
them
the
laws
they
made
were
not
applicable
to
the
white
man
and
he
resented
the
fact
that
they
expected
him
to
conform
to
their
customs
but
he
was
not
a
bad
fellow
indeed
he
was
a
one
and
so
long
as
you
did
not
attempt
to
question
his
authority
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
would
have
done
everything
in
his
power
to
serve
you
xxxviii
the
philosopher
it
was
surprising
to
find
so
vast
a
city
in
a
spot
that
seemed
to
me
so
remote
from
its
battlemented
gate
towards
sunset
you
could
see
the
snowy
mountains
of
tibet
it
was
so
populous
that
you
could
walk
at
ease
only
on
the
walls
and
it
took
a
rapid
walker
three
hours
to
complete
their
circuit
there
was
no
railway
within
a
thousand
miles
and
the
river
on
which
it
stood
was
so
shallow
that
only
junks
of
light
burden
could
safely
navigate
it
five
days
in
a
sampan
were
needed
to
reach
the
upper
yangtze
for
an
uneasy
moment
you
asked
yourself
whether
trains
and
steamships
were
as
necessary
to
the
conduct
of
life
as
we
who
use
them
every
day
consider
for
here
a
million
persons
throve
married
begat
their
kind
and
died
here
a
million
persons
were
busily
occupied
with
commerce
art
and
thought
and
here
lived
a
philosopher
of
repute
the
desire
to
see
whom
had
been
to
me
one
of
the
incentives
of
a
somewhat
arduous
journey
he
was
the
greatest
authority
in
china
on
the
confucian
learning
he
was
said
to
speak
english
and
german
with
facility
he
had
been
for
many
years
secretary
to
one
of
the
empress
dowager
greatest
viceroys
but
he
lived
now
in
retirement
on
certain
days
in
the
week
however
all
through
the
year
he
opened
his
doors
to
such
as
sought
after
knowledge
and
discoursed
on
the
teaching
of
confucius
he
had
a
body
of
disciples
but
it
was
small
since
the
students
for
the
most
part
preferred
to
his
modest
dwelling
and
his
severe
exhortations
the
sumptuous
buildings
of
the
foreign
university
and
the
useful
science
of
the
barbarians
with
him
this
was
mentioned
only
to
be
scornfully
dismissed
from
all
i
heard
of
him
i
concluded
that
he
was
a
man
of
character
when
i
announced
my
wish
to
meet
this
distinguished
person
my
host
immediately
offered
to
arrange
a
meeting
but
the
days
passed
and
nothing
happened
i
made
enquiries
and
my
host
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
sent
him
a
chit
and
told
him
to
come
along
he
said
i
do
know
why
he
has
turned
up
he
a
old
fellow
i
did
not
think
it
was
proper
to
approach
a
philosopher
in
so
cavalier
a
fashion
and
i
was
hardly
surprised
that
he
had
ignored
a
summons
such
as
this
i
caused
a
letter
to
be
sent
asking
in
the
politest
terms
i
could
devise
whether
he
would
allow
me
to
call
upon
him
and
within
two
hours
received
an
answer
making
an
appointment
for
the
following
morning
at
ten
i
was
carried
in
a
chair
the
way
seemed
interminable
i
went
through
crowded
streets
and
through
streets
deserted
till
i
came
at
last
to
one
silent
and
empty
in
which
at
a
small
door
in
a
long
white
wall
my
bearers
set
down
my
chair
one
of
them
knocked
and
after
a
considerable
time
a
judas
was
opened
dark
eyes
looked
through
there
was
a
brief
colloquy
and
finally
i
was
admitted
a
youth
pallid
of
face
wizened
and
poorly
dressed
motioned
me
to
follow
him
i
did
not
know
if
he
was
a
servant
or
a
pupil
of
the
great
man
i
passed
through
a
shabby
yard
and
was
led
into
a
long
low
room
sparsely
furnished
with
an
american
desk
a
couple
of
blackwood
chairs
and
two
little
chinese
tables
against
the
walls
were
shelves
on
which
were
a
great
number
of
books
most
of
them
of
course
were
chinese
but
there
were
many
philosophical
and
scientific
works
in
english
french
and
german
and
there
were
hundreds
of
unbound
copies
of
learned
reviews
where
books
did
not
take
up
the
wall
space
hung
scrolls
on
which
in
various
calligraphies
were
written
i
suppose
confucian
quotations
there
was
no
carpet
on
the
floor
it
was
a
cold
bare
and
comfortless
chamber
its
sombreness
was
relieved
only
by
a
yellow
chrysanthemum
which
stood
by
itself
on
the
desk
in
a
long
vase
i
waited
for
some
time
and
the
youth
who
had
shown
me
in
brought
a
pot
of
tea
two
cups
and
a
tin
of
virginian
cigarettes
as
he
went
out
the
philosopher
entered
i
hastened
to
express
my
sense
of
the
honour
he
did
me
in
allowing
me
to
visit
him
he
waved
me
to
a
chair
and
poured
out
the
tea
i
am
flattered
that
you
wished
to
see
me
he
returned
your
countrymen
deal
only
with
coolies
and
with
compradores
they
think
every
chinese
must
be
one
or
the
other
i
ventured
to
protest
but
i
had
not
caught
his
point
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
looked
at
me
with
an
expression
of
mockery
they
think
they
have
but
to
beckon
and
we
must
come
i
saw
then
that
my
friend
unfortunate
communication
still
rankled
i
did
not
quite
know
how
to
reply
i
murmured
something
complimentary
he
was
an
old
man
tall
with
a
thin
grey
queue
and
bright
large
eyes
under
which
were
heavy
bags
his
teeth
were
broken
and
discoloured
he
was
exceedingly
thin
and
his
hands
fine
and
small
were
withered
and
i
had
been
told
that
he
was
an
he
was
very
shabbily
dressed
in
a
black
gown
a
little
black
cap
both
much
the
worse
for
wear
and
dark
grey
trousers
gartered
at
the
ankle
he
was
watching
he
did
not
quite
know
what
attitude
to
take
up
and
he
had
the
manner
of
a
man
who
was
on
his
guard
of
course
the
philosopher
occupies
a
royal
place
among
those
who
concern
themselves
with
the
things
of
the
spirit
and
we
have
the
authority
of
benjamin
disraeli
that
royalty
must
be
treated
with
abundant
flattery
i
seized
my
trowel
presently
i
was
conscious
of
a
certain
relaxation
in
his
demeanour
he
was
like
a
man
who
was
all
set
and
rigid
to
have
his
photograph
taken
but
hearing
the
shutter
click
lets
himself
go
and
eases
into
his
natural
self
he
showed
me
his
books
i
took
the
in
berlin
you
know
he
said
and
afterwards
i
studied
for
some
time
in
oxford
but
the
english
if
you
will
allow
me
to
say
so
have
no
great
aptitude
for
philosophy
though
he
put
the
remark
apologetically
it
was
evident
that
he
was
not
displeased
to
say
a
slightly
disagreeable
thing
we
have
had
philosophers
who
have
not
been
without
influence
in
the
world
of
thought
i
suggested
hume
and
berkeley
the
philosophers
who
taught
at
oxford
when
i
was
there
were
anxious
not
to
offend
their
theological
colleagues
they
would
not
follow
their
thought
to
its
logical
consequences
in
case
they
should
jeopardise
their
position
in
university
society
have
you
studied
the
modern
developments
of
philosophy
in
america
i
asked
are
you
speaking
of
pragmatism
it
is
the
last
refuge
of
those
who
want
to
believe
the
incredible
i
have
more
use
for
american
petroleum
than
for
american
philosophy
his
judgments
were
tart
we
sat
down
once
more
and
drank
another
cup
of
tea
he
began
to
talk
with
fluency
he
spoke
a
somewhat
formal
but
an
idiomatic
english
now
and
then
he
helped
himself
out
with
a
german
phrase
so
far
as
it
was
possible
for
a
man
of
that
stubborn
character
to
be
influenced
he
had
been
influenced
by
germany
the
method
and
the
industry
of
the
germans
had
deeply
impressed
him
and
their
philosophical
acumen
was
patent
to
him
when
a
laborious
professor
published
in
a
learned
magazine
an
essay
on
one
of
his
own
writings
i
have
written
twenty
books
he
said
and
that
is
the
only
notice
that
has
ever
been
taken
of
me
in
a
european
publication
but
his
study
of
western
philosophy
had
only
served
in
the
end
to
satisfy
him
that
wisdom
after
all
was
to
be
found
within
the
limits
of
the
confucian
canon
he
accepted
its
philosophy
with
conviction
it
answered
the
needs
of
his
spirit
with
a
completeness
which
made
all
foreign
learning
seem
vain
i
was
interested
in
this
because
it
bore
out
an
opinion
of
mine
that
philosophy
is
an
affair
of
character
rather
than
of
logic
the
philosopher
believes
not
according
to
evidence
but
according
to
his
own
temperament
and
his
thinking
merely
serves
to
make
reasonable
what
his
instinct
regards
as
true
if
confucianism
gained
so
firm
a
hold
on
the
chinese
it
is
because
it
explained
and
expressed
them
as
no
other
system
of
thought
could
do
my
host
lit
a
cigarette
his
voice
at
first
had
been
thin
and
tired
but
as
he
grew
interested
in
what
he
said
it
gained
volume
he
talked
vehemently
there
was
in
him
none
of
the
repose
of
the
sage
he
was
a
polemist
and
a
fighter
he
loathed
the
modern
cry
for
individualism
for
him
society
was
the
unit
and
the
family
the
foundation
of
society
he
upheld
the
old
china
and
the
old
school
monarchy
and
the
rigid
canon
of
confucius
he
grew
violent
and
bitter
as
he
spoke
of
the
students
fresh
from
foreign
universities
who
with
sacrilegious
hands
tore
down
the
oldest
civilisation
in
the
world
but
you
do
you
know
what
you
are
doing
he
exclaimed
what
is
the
reason
for
which
you
deem
yourselves
our
betters
have
you
excelled
us
in
arts
or
letters
have
our
thinkers
been
less
profound
than
yours
has
our
civilisation
been
less
elaborate
less
complicated
less
refined
than
yours
why
when
you
lived
in
caves
and
clothed
yourselves
with
skins
we
were
a
cultured
people
do
you
know
that
we
tried
an
experiment
which
is
unique
in
the
history
of
the
world
we
sought
to
rule
this
great
country
not
by
force
but
by
wisdom
and
for
centuries
we
succeeded
then
why
does
the
white
man
despise
the
yellow
shall
i
tell
you
because
he
has
invented
the
machine
gun
that
is
your
superiority
we
are
a
defenceless
horde
and
you
can
blow
us
into
eternity
you
have
shattered
the
dream
of
our
philosophers
that
the
world
could
be
governed
by
the
power
of
law
and
order
and
now
you
are
teaching
our
young
men
your
secret
you
have
thrust
your
hideous
inventions
upon
us
do
you
not
know
that
we
have
a
genius
for
mechanics
do
you
not
know
that
there
are
in
this
country
four
hundred
millions
of
the
most
practical
and
industrious
people
in
the
world
do
you
think
it
will
take
us
long
to
learn
and
what
will
become
of
your
superiority
when
the
yellow
man
can
make
as
good
guns
as
the
white
and
fire
them
as
straight
you
have
appealed
to
the
machine
gun
and
by
the
machine
gun
shall
you
be
judged
but
at
that
moment
we
were
interrupted
a
little
girl
came
softly
in
and
nestled
close
up
to
the
old
gentleman
she
stared
at
me
with
curious
eyes
he
told
me
that
she
was
his
youngest
child
he
put
his
arms
round
her
and
with
a
murmur
of
caressing
words
kissed
her
fondly
she
wore
a
black
coat
and
trousers
that
barely
reached
her
ankles
and
she
had
a
long
hanging
down
her
back
she
was
born
on
the
day
the
revolution
was
brought
to
a
successful
issue
by
the
abdication
of
the
emperor
i
thought
she
heralded
the
spring
of
a
new
era
he
said
she
was
but
the
last
flower
of
this
great
nation
fall
from
a
drawer
in
his
desk
he
took
a
few
cash
and
handing
them
to
her
sent
her
away
you
see
that
i
wear
a
queue
he
said
taking
it
in
his
hands
it
is
a
symbol
i
am
the
last
representative
of
the
old
china
he
talked
to
me
more
gently
now
of
how
philosophers
in
long
past
days
wandered
from
state
to
state
with
their
disciples
teaching
all
who
were
worthy
to
learn
kings
called
them
to
their
councils
and
made
them
rulers
of
cities
his
erudition
was
great
and
his
eloquent
phrases
gave
a
multicoloured
vitality
to
the
incidents
he
related
to
me
of
the
history
of
his
country
i
could
not
help
thinking
him
a
somewhat
pathetic
figure
he
felt
in
himself
the
capacity
to
administer
the
state
but
there
was
no
king
to
entrust
him
with
office
he
had
vast
stores
of
learning
which
he
was
eager
to
impart
to
the
great
band
of
students
that
his
soul
hankered
after
and
there
came
to
listen
but
a
few
wretched
and
obtuse
provincials
once
or
twice
discretion
had
made
me
suggest
that
i
should
take
my
leave
but
he
had
been
unwilling
to
let
me
go
now
at
last
i
was
obliged
to
i
rose
he
held
my
hand
i
should
like
to
give
you
something
as
a
recollection
of
your
visit
to
the
last
philosopher
in
china
but
i
am
a
poor
man
and
i
do
not
know
what
i
can
give
you
that
would
be
worthy
of
your
acceptance
i
protested
that
the
recollection
of
my
visit
was
in
itself
a
priceless
gift
he
smiled
men
have
short
memories
in
these
degenerate
days
and
i
should
like
to
give
you
something
more
substantial
i
would
give
you
one
of
my
books
but
you
can
not
read
chinese
he
looked
at
me
with
an
amicable
perplexity
i
had
an
inspiration
give
me
a
sample
of
your
calligraphy
i
said
would
you
like
that
he
smiled
in
my
youth
i
was
considered
to
wield
the
brush
in
a
manner
that
was
not
entirely
despicable
he
sat
down
at
his
desk
took
a
fair
sheet
of
paper
and
placed
it
before
him
he
poured
a
few
drops
of
water
on
a
stone
rubbed
the
ink
stick
in
it
and
took
his
brush
with
a
free
movement
of
the
arm
he
began
to
write
and
as
i
watched
him
i
remembered
with
not
a
little
amusement
something
else
which
had
been
told
me
of
him
it
appeared
that
the
old
gentleman
whenever
he
could
scrape
a
little
money
together
spent
it
wantonly
in
the
streets
inhabited
by
ladies
to
describe
whom
a
euphemism
is
generally
used
his
eldest
son
a
person
of
standing
in
the
city
was
vexed
and
humiliated
by
the
scandal
of
this
behaviour
and
only
his
strong
sense
of
filial
duty
prevented
him
from
reproaching
the
libertine
with
severity
i
daresay
that
to
a
son
such
looseness
would
be
disconcerting
but
the
student
of
human
nature
could
look
upon
it
with
equanimity
philosophers
are
apt
to
elaborate
their
theories
in
the
study
forming
conclusions
upon
life
which
they
know
only
at
second
hand
and
it
has
seemed
to
me
often
that
their
works
would
have
a
more
definite
significance
if
they
had
exposed
themselves
to
the
vicissitudes
which
befall
the
common
run
of
men
i
was
prepared
to
regard
the
old
gentleman
dalliance
in
hidden
places
with
leniency
perhaps
he
sought
but
to
elucidate
the
most
inscrutable
of
human
illusions
he
finished
to
dry
the
ink
he
scattered
a
little
ash
on
the
paper
and
rising
handed
it
to
me
what
have
you
written
i
asked
i
thought
there
was
a
slightly
malicious
gleam
in
his
eyes
i
have
ventured
to
offer
you
two
little
poems
of
my
own
i
did
not
know
you
were
a
poet
when
china
was
still
an
uncivilised
country
he
retorted
with
sarcasm
all
educated
men
could
write
verse
at
least
with
elegance
i
took
the
paper
and
looked
at
the
chinese
characters
they
made
an
agreeable
pattern
upon
it
wo
you
also
give
me
a
translation
he
answered
you
can
not
expect
me
to
betray
myself
ask
one
of
your
english
friends
those
who
know
most
about
china
know
nothing
but
you
will
at
least
find
one
who
is
competent
to
give
you
a
rendering
of
a
few
rough
and
simple
lines
i
bade
him
farewell
and
with
great
politeness
he
showed
me
to
my
chair
when
i
had
the
opportunity
i
gave
the
poems
to
a
sinologue
of
my
acquaintance
and
here
is
the
version
he
made
i
confess
that
doubtless
unreasonably
i
was
somewhat
taken
aback
when
i
read
it
loved
me
not
your
voice
was
sweet
your
eyes
were
full
of
laughter
your
hands
were
tender
and
then
you
loved
me
your
voice
was
bitter
your
eyes
were
full
of
tears
your
hands
were
cruel
sad
sad
that
love
should
make
you
craved
the
years
would
quickly
pass
that
you
might
lose
the
brightness
of
your
eyes
the
of
your
skin
and
all
the
cruel
splendour
of
your
youth
then
i
alone
would
love
you
and
you
at
last
would
envious
years
have
passed
full
soon
and
you
have
lost
the
brightness
of
your
eyes
the
of
your
skin
and
all
the
charming
splendour
of
your
youth
alas
i
do
not
love
you
and
i
care
not
if
you
i
owe
it
to
the
kindness
of
my
friend
davidson
xxxix
the
missionary
lady
she
was
certainly
fifty
but
a
life
of
convictions
harassed
by
never
a
doubt
had
left
her
face
unwrinkled
the
hesitations
of
thought
had
never
lined
the
smoothness
of
her
brow
her
features
were
bold
and
regular
somewhat
masculine
and
her
determined
chin
bore
out
the
impression
given
you
by
her
eyes
they
were
blue
confident
and
unperturbed
they
summed
you
up
through
large
round
spectacles
you
felt
that
here
was
a
woman
to
whom
command
came
easily
her
charity
was
above
all
things
competent
and
you
were
certain
that
she
ran
the
obvious
goodness
of
her
heart
on
thoroughly
business
lines
it
was
possible
to
suppose
that
she
was
not
devoid
of
human
vanity
and
this
is
to
be
counted
to
her
for
grace
since
she
wore
a
dress
of
violet
silk
heavily
embroidered
and
a
toque
of
immense
pansies
which
on
a
less
respectable
head
would
have
been
almost
saucy
but
my
uncle
henry
for
years
vicar
of
whitstable
who
had
decided
views
on
the
proper
manner
of
dress
for
a
clergyman
wife
never
objected
to
my
aunt
sophie
wearing
violet
and
he
would
have
found
nothing
to
criticise
in
the
missionary
lady
gown
she
spoke
fluently
with
the
even
flow
of
water
turned
on
at
a
tap
her
conversation
had
the
admirable
volubility
of
a
politician
at
the
end
of
an
electioneering
campaign
you
felt
that
she
knew
what
she
meant
with
most
of
us
so
rare
an
accomplishment
and
meant
what
she
said
i
always
think
she
remarked
pleasantly
that
if
you
know
both
sides
of
a
question
you
judge
differently
from
what
you
will
if
you
only
know
one
side
but
the
fact
remains
that
two
and
two
make
four
and
you
can
argue
all
night
and
you
wo
make
them
five
am
i
right
or
am
i
wrong
i
hastened
to
assure
her
that
she
was
right
though
with
these
new
theories
of
relativity
and
parallel
lines
behaving
at
infinity
in
such
a
surprising
manner
i
was
in
my
heart
of
hearts
none
too
sure
no
one
can
eat
their
cake
and
have
it
she
continued
exemplifying
benedetto
croce
theory
that
grammar
has
little
to
do
with
expression
and
one
has
to
take
the
rough
with
the
smooth
but
as
i
always
say
to
the
children
you
ca
expect
to
have
everything
your
own
way
no
one
is
perfect
in
this
world
and
i
always
think
that
if
you
expect
the
best
from
people
you
get
the
best
i
confess
that
i
was
staggered
but
i
determined
to
do
my
part
it
was
only
civil
most
men
live
long
enough
to
discover
that
every
cloud
has
a
silver
lining
i
began
earnestly
with
perseverance
you
can
do
most
things
that
are
not
beyond
your
powers
and
after
all
it
better
to
want
what
you
have
than
to
have
what
you
want
i
thought
her
eyes
were
glazed
with
a
sudden
perplexity
when
i
made
this
confident
statement
but
i
daresay
it
was
only
my
fancy
for
she
nodded
vigorously
of
course
i
see
your
point
she
said
we
ca
do
more
than
we
can
but
my
blood
was
up
now
and
i
waved
aside
the
interruption
i
went
on
few
people
realise
the
profound
truth
that
there
are
twenty
shillings
in
every
pound
and
twelve
pence
in
every
shilling
i
sure
it
better
to
see
clearly
to
the
end
of
your
nose
than
indistinctly
through
a
brick
wall
if
there
one
thing
we
can
be
certain
about
it
is
that
the
whole
is
greater
than
the
part
when
with
a
hearty
shake
of
the
hand
firm
and
characteristic
she
bade
me
farewell
she
said
well
we
had
a
most
interesting
chat
it
does
one
good
in
a
place
like
this
so
far
away
from
civilisation
to
exchange
ideas
with
intellectual
equals
especially
other
people
i
murmured
i
always
think
that
one
should
profit
by
the
great
thoughts
of
the
past
she
retorted
it
shows
that
the
mighty
dead
have
not
lived
in
vain
her
conversation
was
devastating
xl
a
game
of
billiards
i
was
sitting
in
the
lobby
of
the
hotel
reading
a
number
several
days
old
of
the
china
when
the
door
of
the
bar
was
somewhat
brusquely
thrown
open
and
a
very
long
thin
man
appeared
do
you
care
for
a
game
of
billiards
he
said
by
all
means
i
got
up
and
went
with
him
into
the
bar
it
was
a
small
hotel
of
stone
somewhat
pretentious
in
appearance
and
it
was
kept
by
a
portuguese
who
smoked
opium
there
were
not
half
a
dozen
people
staying
there
a
portuguese
official
and
his
wife
waiting
for
a
ship
to
take
them
to
a
distant
colony
a
lancashire
engineer
who
was
sullenly
drunk
all
day
long
a
mysterious
lady
no
longer
young
but
of
voluptuous
appearance
who
came
to
the
dining
room
for
meals
and
went
back
to
her
room
immediately
afterwards
and
i
had
not
seen
the
stranger
before
i
supposed
he
had
come
in
that
evening
on
a
chinese
boat
he
was
a
man
of
over
fifty
i
should
think
shrivelled
as
though
the
sap
had
been
dried
out
of
him
by
tropical
suns
with
a
face
that
was
almost
brick
red
i
could
not
place
him
he
might
have
been
a
skipper
out
of
a
job
or
the
agent
of
some
foreign
firm
in
hong
kong
he
was
very
silent
and
he
made
no
answer
to
the
casual
remarks
that
i
made
in
the
course
of
the
game
he
played
billiards
well
enough
though
not
excellently
but
he
was
a
very
pleasant
fellow
to
play
with
and
when
he
pocketed
my
ball
instead
of
leaving
me
a
double
balk
gave
me
a
reasonable
shot
but
when
the
game
was
over
i
should
never
have
thought
of
him
again
if
suddenly
breaking
his
silence
for
the
first
time
he
had
not
put
me
a
very
odd
question
do
you
believe
in
fate
he
asked
at
billiards
i
retorted
not
a
little
astonished
at
his
remark
no
in
life
i
did
not
want
to
answer
him
seriously
i
hardly
know
i
said
he
took
his
shot
he
made
a
little
break
at
the
end
of
it
chalking
his
cue
he
said
i
do
i
believe
if
things
are
coming
to
you
you
ca
escape
them
that
was
all
he
said
nothing
more
when
we
had
finished
the
game
he
went
up
to
bed
and
i
never
saw
him
again
i
shall
never
know
what
strange
emotion
impelled
him
to
put
that
sudden
question
to
a
stranger
xli
the
skipper
i
knew
he
was
drunk
he
was
a
skipper
of
the
new
school
a
neat
little
man
who
might
easily
have
passed
for
the
commander
of
a
submarine
in
his
cabin
there
hung
a
beautiful
new
coat
with
gold
braid
on
it
the
uniform
which
for
its
good
service
in
the
war
has
been
granted
to
the
mercantile
marine
but
he
was
shy
of
using
it
it
seemed
absurd
when
he
was
no
more
than
captain
of
a
small
boat
on
the
yangtze
and
he
stood
on
his
bridge
in
a
neat
brown
suit
and
a
homburg
hat
you
could
almost
see
yourself
in
his
admirably
polished
shoes
his
eyes
were
clear
and
bright
and
his
skin
was
fresh
though
he
had
been
at
sea
for
twenty
years
and
could
not
have
been
much
less
than
forty
he
did
not
look
more
than
you
might
be
sure
that
he
was
a
fellow
as
healthy
in
mind
as
he
was
in
body
and
the
depravity
of
the
east
of
which
they
talk
had
left
him
untouched
he
had
a
pleasant
taste
in
light
literature
and
the
works
of
lucas
adorned
his
in
his
cabin
you
saw
a
photograph
of
a
football
team
in
which
he
figured
and
two
of
a
young
woman
with
neatly
waved
hair
whom
it
was
possible
enough
he
was
engaged
to
i
knew
he
was
drunk
but
i
did
not
think
he
was
very
drunk
till
he
asked
me
suddenly
what
is
democracy
i
returned
an
evasive
perhaps
a
flippant
answer
and
for
some
minutes
the
conversation
turned
on
less
unseasonable
topics
to
the
occasion
then
breaking
his
silence
he
said
i
hope
you
do
think
i
a
socialist
because
i
said
what
is
democracy
not
at
all
i
answered
but
i
do
see
why
you
should
be
a
socialist
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
i
not
he
protested
if
i
had
my
way
i
stand
them
up
against
a
wall
and
shoot
them
what
is
socialism
i
asked
oh
you
know
what
i
mean
henderson
and
ramsay
macdonald
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
he
answered
i
about
fed
up
with
the
working
man
but
you
a
working
man
yourself
i
should
have
thought
he
was
silent
for
quite
a
long
time
and
i
thought
his
mind
had
wandered
to
other
things
but
i
was
wrong
he
was
thinking
my
statement
over
in
all
its
bearings
for
at
last
he
said
look
here
i
not
a
working
man
hang
it
all
i
was
at
harrow
xlii
the
sights
of
the
town
i
am
not
an
industrious
and
when
guides
professional
or
friendly
urge
me
to
visit
a
famous
monument
i
have
a
stubborn
inclination
to
send
them
about
their
business
too
many
eyes
before
mine
have
looked
with
awe
upon
mont
blanc
too
many
hearts
before
mine
have
throbbed
with
deep
emotion
in
the
presence
of
the
sistine
madonna
sights
like
these
are
like
women
of
too
generous
sympathies
you
feel
that
so
many
persons
have
found
solace
in
their
commiseration
that
you
are
embarrassed
when
they
bid
you
with
what
practised
tact
to
whisper
in
their
discreet
ears
the
whole
tale
of
your
distress
supposing
you
were
the
last
straw
that
broke
the
camel
back
no
madam
i
will
take
my
sorrows
if
i
can
not
bear
them
alone
which
is
better
to
someone
who
is
not
quite
so
certain
of
saying
so
exactly
the
right
thing
to
comfort
me
when
i
am
in
a
foreign
town
i
prefer
to
wander
at
random
and
if
maybe
i
lose
the
rapture
of
a
gothic
cathedral
i
may
happen
upon
a
little
romanesque
chapel
or
a
renaissance
doorway
which
i
shall
be
able
to
flatter
myself
no
one
else
has
troubled
about
but
of
course
this
was
a
very
extraordinary
sight
indeed
and
it
would
have
been
absurd
to
miss
it
i
came
across
it
by
pure
chance
i
was
sauntering
along
a
dusty
road
outside
the
city
wall
and
by
the
side
of
it
i
saw
a
number
of
memorial
arches
they
were
small
and
undecorated
standing
not
across
the
way
but
along
it
close
to
one
another
and
sometimes
one
in
front
of
the
other
as
though
they
had
been
erected
by
no
impulse
of
gratitude
to
the
departed
or
of
admiration
for
the
virtuous
but
in
formal
compliment
as
knighthoods
on
the
birthday
are
conferred
on
prominent
citizens
of
provincial
towns
behind
this
row
of
arches
the
land
rose
sharply
and
since
in
this
part
of
the
country
the
chinese
bury
their
dead
by
preference
on
the
side
of
a
hill
it
was
thickly
covered
with
graves
a
trodden
path
led
to
a
little
tower
and
i
followed
it
it
was
a
stumpy
little
tower
ten
feet
high
perhaps
made
of
blocks
of
stone
it
was
cone
shaped
and
the
roof
was
like
a
pierrot
hat
it
stood
on
a
hillock
quaint
and
rather
picturesque
against
the
blue
sky
amid
the
graves
at
its
foot
were
a
number
of
rough
baskets
thrown
about
in
disorder
i
walked
round
and
on
one
side
saw
an
oblong
hole
eighteen
inches
by
eight
perhaps
from
which
hung
a
stout
string
from
the
hole
there
came
a
very
strange
a
nauseating
odour
suddenly
i
understood
what
the
queer
little
building
was
it
was
a
baby
tower
the
baskets
were
the
baskets
in
which
the
babies
had
been
brought
two
or
three
of
them
were
quite
new
they
could
not
have
been
there
more
than
a
few
hours
and
the
string
why
if
the
person
who
brought
the
baby
parent
or
grandmother
midwife
or
obliging
friend
were
of
a
humane
disposition
and
did
not
care
to
let
the
child
drop
to
the
bottom
for
underneath
the
tower
was
a
deep
pit
it
could
be
let
down
gently
by
means
of
the
string
the
odour
was
the
odour
of
putrefaction
a
lively
little
boy
came
up
to
me
while
i
stood
there
and
made
me
understand
that
four
babes
had
been
brought
to
the
tower
that
morning
there
are
philosophers
who
look
upon
evil
with
a
certain
complacency
since
without
it
they
opine
there
would
be
no
possibility
of
good
without
want
there
would
be
no
occasion
for
charity
without
distress
of
sympathy
without
danger
of
courage
and
without
unhappiness
of
resignation
they
would
find
in
the
chinese
practice
of
infanticide
an
apt
illustration
of
their
views
except
for
the
baby
tower
there
would
not
be
in
this
city
an
orphanage
the
traveller
would
miss
an
interesting
and
curious
sight
and
a
few
poor
women
would
have
no
opportunity
to
exercise
a
beautiful
and
touching
virtue
the
orphanage
is
shabby
and
bedraggled
it
is
situated
in
a
poor
and
crowded
part
of
the
city
for
the
spanish
nuns
who
conduct
it
there
are
but
five
of
them
think
it
more
convenient
to
live
where
they
may
be
most
useful
and
besides
they
have
not
the
money
to
build
commodious
premises
in
a
salubrious
quarter
the
institution
is
supported
by
the
work
lace
and
fine
embroidery
which
they
teach
the
girls
to
do
and
by
the
alms
of
the
faithful
two
nuns
the
mother
superior
and
another
showed
me
what
there
was
to
see
it
was
very
strange
to
go
through
the
whitewashed
rooms
playrooms
dormitories
and
refectory
low
cool
and
bare
for
you
might
have
been
in
spain
and
when
you
passed
a
window
you
half
expected
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
giralda
and
it
was
charming
to
see
the
tenderness
with
which
the
nuns
used
the
children
there
were
two
hundred
of
them
and
they
were
of
course
orphans
only
in
the
sense
that
their
parents
had
abandoned
them
there
was
one
room
in
which
a
number
were
playing
all
of
the
same
age
perhaps
four
and
all
of
the
same
size
with
their
black
eyes
and
black
hair
their
yellow
skins
they
all
looked
so
much
alike
that
they
might
have
been
the
children
of
a
chinese
old
woman
who
lived
in
a
shoe
they
crowded
round
the
nuns
and
began
to
romp
with
them
the
mother
superior
had
the
gentlest
voice
i
ever
heard
but
it
became
gentler
still
when
she
joked
with
the
tiny
mites
they
nestled
about
her
she
looked
a
very
picture
of
charity
some
were
deformed
and
some
were
diseased
some
were
puny
and
hideous
some
were
blind
it
gave
me
a
little
shudder
i
marvelled
when
i
saw
the
love
that
filled
her
kind
eyes
and
the
affectionate
sweetness
of
her
smile
then
i
was
taken
into
a
parlour
where
i
was
made
to
eat
little
sweet
spanish
cakes
and
given
a
glass
of
manzanilla
to
drink
and
when
i
told
them
that
i
had
lived
in
seville
a
third
nun
was
sent
for
so
that
she
might
talk
for
a
few
minutes
with
someone
who
had
seen
the
city
she
was
born
in
with
pride
they
showed
me
their
poor
little
chapel
with
its
tawdry
statue
of
the
blessed
virgin
its
paper
flowers
and
its
gaudy
shoddy
decoration
for
those
dear
faithful
hearts
alas
were
possessed
of
singularly
bad
taste
i
did
not
care
to
me
there
was
something
positively
touching
in
that
dreadful
vulgarity
and
when
i
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
mother
superior
asked
me
whether
i
would
care
to
see
the
babies
who
had
come
in
that
day
in
order
to
persuade
people
to
bring
them
they
gave
twenty
cents
for
every
one
twenty
cents
you
see
she
explained
they
have
often
a
long
walk
to
come
here
and
unless
we
give
them
something
they
wo
take
the
trouble
she
took
me
into
a
little
anteroom
near
the
entrance
and
there
lying
on
a
table
under
a
counterpane
were
four
babes
they
had
just
been
washed
and
put
into
long
clothes
the
counterpane
was
lifted
off
they
lay
side
by
side
on
their
backs
four
tiny
wriggling
mites
very
red
in
the
face
rather
cross
perhaps
because
they
had
been
bathed
and
very
hungry
their
eyes
seemed
preternaturally
large
they
were
so
small
so
helpless
you
were
forced
to
smile
when
you
looked
at
them
and
at
the
same
time
you
felt
a
lump
in
your
throat
xliii
nightfall
towards
evening
perhaps
tired
of
walking
you
get
into
your
chair
and
on
the
crest
of
a
hill
you
pass
through
a
stone
gateway
you
can
not
tell
why
there
should
be
a
gateway
in
that
deserted
spot
far
from
a
village
but
a
fragment
of
massive
wall
suggests
the
ruin
of
fortifications
against
the
foes
of
a
forgotten
dynasty
and
when
you
come
through
the
gateway
you
see
below
you
the
shining
water
in
the
rice
fields
diapered
like
the
in
some
chinese
in
and
then
the
rounded
hills
but
making
your
way
down
the
stone
steps
of
the
narrow
causeway
which
is
the
high
road
from
city
to
city
in
the
gathering
darkness
you
pass
a
coppice
and
from
it
waft
towards
you
chill
woodland
odours
of
the
night
then
you
hear
no
longer
the
measured
tread
of
your
bearers
your
ears
are
on
a
sudden
deaf
to
their
sharp
cries
as
they
change
the
pole
from
shoulder
to
shoulder
and
to
the
ceaseless
chatter
or
the
occasional
snatch
of
song
with
which
they
enliven
the
monotonous
way
for
the
woodland
odours
are
the
same
as
those
which
steal
up
from
the
fat
kentish
soil
when
you
pass
through
the
woods
of
bleane
and
nostalgia
seizes
you
your
thoughts
travel
through
time
and
space
far
from
the
here
and
now
and
you
remember
your
vanished
youth
with
its
high
hopes
its
passionate
love
and
its
ambition
then
if
you
are
a
cynic
as
they
say
and
therefore
a
sentimentalist
tears
come
to
your
unwilling
eyes
and
when
you
have
regained
your
the
night
has
fallen
xliv
the
normal
man
i
was
once
obliged
to
study
anatomy
a
very
dreary
business
since
there
is
neither
rhyme
nor
reason
for
the
vast
number
of
things
you
have
to
remember
but
one
remark
made
by
my
teacher
when
he
was
helping
me
in
the
dissection
of
a
thigh
has
always
remained
in
my
memory
i
was
looking
in
vain
for
a
certain
nerve
and
it
needed
his
greater
skill
to
discover
it
in
a
place
in
which
i
had
not
sought
it
i
was
aggrieved
because
the
text
book
had
misled
me
he
smiled
and
said
you
see
the
normal
is
the
rarest
thing
in
the
world
and
though
he
spoke
of
anatomy
he
might
have
spoken
with
equal
truth
of
man
the
casual
observation
impressed
itself
upon
me
as
many
a
profounder
one
has
not
and
all
the
years
that
have
passed
since
then
with
the
increasing
knowledge
of
human
nature
which
they
have
brought
have
only
strengthened
my
conviction
of
its
truth
i
have
met
a
hundred
men
who
seemed
perfectly
normal
only
to
find
in
them
presently
an
idiosyncrasy
so
marked
as
to
put
them
almost
in
a
class
by
themselves
it
has
entertained
me
not
a
little
to
discover
the
hidden
oddity
of
men
to
all
appearances
most
ordinary
i
have
been
often
amazed
to
come
upon
a
hideous
depravity
in
men
who
you
would
have
sworn
were
perfectly
commonplace
i
have
at
last
sought
the
normal
man
as
a
precious
work
of
art
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
to
know
him
would
give
me
that
peculiar
satisfaction
which
can
only
be
described
as
æsthetic
i
really
thought
i
had
found
him
in
robert
webb
he
was
a
consul
in
one
of
the
smaller
ports
and
i
was
given
a
letter
to
him
i
heard
a
good
deal
about
him
on
my
way
through
china
and
i
heard
nothing
but
good
whenever
i
happened
to
mention
that
i
was
going
to
the
port
in
which
he
was
stationed
someone
was
sure
to
say
you
like
bob
webb
he
an
awfully
good
chap
he
was
no
less
popular
as
an
official
than
he
was
as
a
private
person
he
managed
to
please
the
merchants
because
he
was
active
in
their
interests
without
antagonising
the
chinese
who
praised
his
firmness
or
the
missionaries
who
approved
his
private
life
during
the
revolution
by
his
tact
decision
and
courage
he
had
not
only
saved
from
great
danger
the
foreign
population
of
the
city
in
which
he
then
was
but
also
many
chinese
he
had
come
forward
as
a
peacemaker
between
the
warring
parties
and
by
his
ingenuity
had
been
able
to
bring
about
a
satisfactory
settlement
he
was
marked
down
for
promotion
i
certainly
found
him
a
very
engaging
fellow
though
he
was
not
his
appearance
was
pleasing
he
was
tall
perhaps
a
little
more
than
of
average
height
well
covered
without
being
fat
with
a
fresh
complexion
inclined
now
for
he
was
nearly
fifty
to
be
somewhat
bloated
in
the
morning
this
was
not
strange
for
in
china
the
foreigners
both
eat
and
drink
a
great
deal
too
much
and
robert
webb
had
a
healthy
liking
for
the
good
things
of
life
he
kept
an
excellent
table
he
liked
eating
in
company
and
it
was
seldom
that
he
did
not
have
one
or
two
people
to
tiffin
or
to
dinner
with
him
his
eyes
were
blue
and
friendly
he
had
the
social
gifts
that
give
pleasure
he
played
the
piano
quite
well
but
he
liked
the
music
that
other
people
liked
and
he
was
always
ready
to
play
a
one
step
or
a
waltz
if
others
wanted
to
dance
with
a
wife
a
son
and
a
daughter
in
england
he
could
not
afford
to
keep
racing
ponies
but
he
was
keenly
interested
in
racing
he
was
a
good
tennis
player
and
his
bridge
was
better
than
the
average
unlike
many
of
his
colleagues
he
did
not
allow
himself
to
be
overwhelmed
by
his
position
and
in
the
evening
at
the
club
he
was
affable
and
unaffected
but
he
did
not
forget
that
he
was
his
britannic
majesty
consul
and
i
admired
the
skill
with
which
without
portentousness
he
preserved
the
dignity
which
he
thought
necessary
to
his
station
in
short
he
had
very
good
manners
he
talked
agreeably
and
his
interests
though
somewhat
ordinary
were
varied
he
had
a
nice
sense
of
humour
he
could
make
a
joke
and
tell
a
good
story
he
was
very
happily
married
his
son
was
at
charterhouse
and
he
showed
me
a
photograph
of
a
tall
fair
lad
in
flannels
with
a
frank
and
pleasant
face
he
showed
me
also
the
photograph
of
his
daughter
it
is
one
of
the
tragedies
of
life
in
china
that
a
man
must
be
separated
for
long
periods
from
his
family
and
owing
to
the
war
robert
webb
had
not
seen
his
for
eight
years
his
wife
had
taken
the
children
home
when
the
boy
was
eight
and
the
girl
eleven
they
had
meant
to
wait
till
his
leave
came
so
that
they
could
go
all
together
but
he
was
stationed
in
a
place
that
suited
neither
of
the
children
and
he
and
his
wife
agreed
that
she
had
better
take
them
at
once
his
leave
was
due
in
three
years
and
then
he
could
spend
twelve
months
with
them
but
when
the
time
for
this
came
the
war
broke
out
the
consular
staff
was
and
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
leave
his
post
his
wife
did
not
want
to
be
separated
from
young
children
the
journey
was
difficult
and
dangerous
no
one
expected
the
war
to
last
so
long
and
one
by
one
the
years
passed
my
girl
was
a
child
when
i
saw
her
last
he
said
to
me
when
he
showed
me
the
photograph
now
she
a
married
woman
when
are
you
going
on
leave
i
asked
him
oh
my
wife
coming
out
now
but
do
you
want
to
see
your
daughter
i
asked
he
looked
at
the
photograph
again
and
then
looked
away
there
was
a
curious
look
in
his
face
a
somewhat
peevish
look
i
thought
and
he
answered
i
been
away
from
home
too
long
now
i
shall
never
go
back
i
leaned
back
in
my
chair
smoking
my
pipe
the
photograph
showed
me
a
girl
of
nineteen
with
wide
blue
eyes
and
bobbed
hair
it
was
a
pretty
face
open
and
friendly
but
the
most
noticeable
thing
about
it
was
a
peculiar
charm
of
expression
bob
webb
daughter
was
a
very
alluring
young
person
i
liked
that
engaging
audacity
it
was
rather
a
surprise
to
me
when
she
sent
along
that
photograph
he
said
presently
i
always
thought
of
her
as
a
child
if
i
met
her
in
the
street
i
should
have
known
her
he
gave
a
little
laugh
that
was
not
quite
natural
it
is
fair
when
she
was
a
child
she
used
to
love
being
petted
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
photograph
i
seemed
to
see
in
them
a
very
unexpected
emotion
i
can
hardly
realise
she
my
daughter
i
thought
she
come
back
with
her
mother
and
then
she
wrote
and
said
she
was
engaged
he
looked
away
now
and
i
thought
there
was
a
singular
embarrassment
in
the
corners
of
his
mouth
i
suppose
one
gets
selfish
out
here
i
felt
awfully
sore
but
i
gave
a
big
dinner
party
to
all
the
fellows
here
the
day
she
was
married
and
we
all
got
blind
he
gave
an
apologetic
laugh
i
had
to
you
know
he
said
awkwardly
i
had
such
an
awful
hump
what
the
young
man
like
i
asked
she
awfully
in
love
with
him
when
she
writes
to
me
her
letters
are
about
nothing
else
there
was
an
odd
quaver
in
his
voice
it
a
bit
thick
to
bring
a
child
into
the
world
and
to
educate
her
and
be
fond
of
her
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
just
for
some
man
whom
you
never
even
seen
i
got
his
photograph
somewhere
i
do
know
where
it
is
i
do
think
i
care
about
him
very
much
he
helped
himself
to
another
whisky
he
was
tired
he
looked
old
and
bloated
he
said
nothing
for
a
long
time
and
then
suddenly
he
seemed
to
pull
himself
together
well
thank
god
her
mother
coming
out
soon
i
do
think
he
was
quite
a
normal
man
after
all
xlv
the
old
timer
he
was
years
old
he
had
come
to
china
when
he
was
little
more
than
a
boy
as
second
mate
of
a
sailing
vessel
and
had
never
gone
home
again
since
then
he
had
been
many
things
for
long
years
he
had
commanded
a
chinese
boat
that
ran
from
shanghai
to
ichang
and
he
knew
by
heart
every
inch
of
the
great
and
terrible
yangtze
he
had
been
master
of
a
tug
at
and
had
fought
in
the
army
he
had
got
a
lot
of
loot
in
the
boxer
troubles
and
had
been
in
hankow
during
the
revolution
when
the
rebels
shelled
the
city
he
had
been
married
three
times
first
to
a
japanese
woman
then
to
a
chinese
and
finally
when
he
was
hard
upon
fifty
to
an
englishwoman
they
were
all
dead
now
and
it
was
the
japanese
who
lingered
in
his
memory
he
would
tell
you
how
she
arranged
the
flowers
in
the
house
in
shanghai
just
one
chrysanthemum
in
a
vase
or
a
sprig
of
cherry
blossom
and
he
always
remembered
how
she
held
a
with
both
hands
delicately
he
had
had
a
number
of
children
but
he
took
no
interest
in
them
they
were
settled
in
the
various
ports
of
china
in
banks
and
shipping
offices
and
he
seldom
saw
them
he
was
proud
of
his
daughter
by
his
english
wife
the
only
girl
he
ever
had
but
she
had
married
well
and
was
gone
to
england
he
would
never
see
her
again
the
only
person
now
for
whom
he
had
any
affection
was
the
boy
who
had
been
with
him
for
five
and
forty
years
he
was
a
little
wizened
chinaman
with
a
bald
head
slow
of
movement
and
solemn
he
was
well
over
sixty
they
quarrelled
incessantly
the
old
timer
would
tell
the
boy
that
he
was
past
his
work
and
that
he
must
get
rid
of
him
and
then
the
boy
would
say
that
he
was
tired
of
serving
a
mad
foreign
devil
but
each
knew
that
the
other
did
not
mean
a
word
he
said
they
were
old
friends
old
men
both
of
them
and
they
would
remain
together
till
death
parted
them
it
was
when
he
married
his
english
wife
that
he
retired
from
the
water
and
put
his
savings
into
a
hotel
but
it
was
not
a
success
it
was
a
little
way
from
shanghai
a
summer
resort
and
it
was
before
there
were
motor
cars
in
china
he
was
a
sociable
fellow
and
he
spent
too
much
of
his
time
in
the
bar
he
was
generous
and
he
gave
away
as
many
drinks
as
were
paid
for
he
also
had
the
peculiar
habit
of
spitting
in
the
bath
and
the
more
squeamish
of
his
visitors
objected
to
it
when
his
last
wife
died
he
found
it
was
she
who
had
kept
things
from
going
to
pieces
and
in
a
little
while
he
could
no
longer
bear
up
against
the
difficulty
of
his
circumstances
all
his
savings
had
gone
into
buying
the
place
now
heavily
mortgaged
and
in
making
up
the
deficit
year
by
year
he
was
obliged
to
sell
out
to
a
japanese
and
having
paid
his
debts
at
the
age
of
found
himself
without
a
penny
but
by
god
sir
he
was
a
sailor
one
of
the
companies
running
boats
up
the
yangtze
gave
him
a
berth
as
chief
officer
he
had
no
master
certificate
and
he
returned
to
the
river
which
he
knew
so
well
for
eight
years
he
had
been
on
the
same
run
and
now
he
stood
on
the
bridge
of
his
trim
little
ship
not
so
large
as
a
penny
steamer
on
the
thames
a
gallant
figure
upright
and
slender
as
when
he
was
a
lad
in
a
neat
blue
suit
and
the
company
cap
set
jauntily
on
his
white
hair
with
his
pointed
beard
nattily
trimmed
years
old
it
is
a
great
age
with
his
head
thrown
back
his
glasses
in
his
hand
the
chinese
pilot
by
his
side
he
watched
the
vast
expanse
of
the
winding
river
a
fleet
of
junks
with
their
high
sterns
their
square
sails
set
descended
on
the
swift
current
and
the
rowers
chanted
a
monotonous
chant
as
they
worked
at
their
creaking
oars
the
yellow
water
in
the
setting
sun
was
lovely
with
pale
soft
tints
it
was
as
smooth
as
glass
and
along
the
flat
banks
the
trees
and
the
huts
of
a
bedraggled
village
hazy
in
the
heat
of
the
day
were
now
silhouetted
sharply
like
the
shadows
of
a
shadowgraph
against
the
pale
sky
he
raised
his
head
as
he
heard
the
cry
of
wild
geese
and
he
saw
them
flying
high
above
him
in
a
great
v
to
what
far
lands
he
knew
not
in
the
distance
against
the
sunlight
stood
a
solitary
hill
crowned
with
temples
because
he
had
seen
all
this
so
often
it
affected
him
strangely
the
dying
day
made
him
think
he
knew
not
why
of
his
long
past
and
of
his
great
age
he
regretted
nothing
by
george
he
muttered
i
had
a
fine
life
xlvi
the
plain
the
incident
was
of
course
perfectly
trivial
and
it
could
be
very
easily
explained
but
i
was
surprised
that
the
eyes
of
the
spirit
could
blind
me
so
completely
to
what
was
visible
to
the
eyes
of
sense
i
was
taken
aback
to
find
how
completely
one
could
be
at
the
mercy
of
the
laws
of
association
day
after
day
i
had
marched
among
the
uplands
and
i
knew
that
i
must
come
to
the
great
plain
in
which
lay
the
ancient
city
whither
i
was
bound
but
when
i
set
out
in
the
morning
there
was
no
sign
that
i
approached
it
indeed
the
hills
seemed
no
less
sheer
and
when
i
reached
the
top
of
one
thinking
to
see
the
valley
below
it
was
only
to
see
before
me
one
steeper
and
taller
yet
beyond
climbing
steadily
i
could
see
the
white
causeway
that
i
had
followed
so
long
shining
in
the
sunlight
as
it
skirted
the
brow
of
a
rugged
tawny
rock
the
sky
was
blue
and
in
the
west
hung
here
and
there
little
clouds
like
fishing
boats
becalmed
towards
evening
off
dungeness
i
trudged
along
mounting
all
the
time
alert
for
the
prospect
that
awaited
me
if
not
round
this
bend
then
round
the
next
and
at
last
suddenly
when
i
was
thinking
of
other
things
i
came
upon
it
but
it
was
no
chinese
landscape
that
i
saw
with
its
padi
fields
its
memorial
arches
and
its
fantastic
temples
with
its
farmhouses
set
in
a
bamboo
grove
and
its
wayside
inns
where
under
the
banyan
trees
the
poor
coolies
may
rest
them
of
their
weary
loads
it
was
the
valley
of
the
rhine
the
broad
plain
all
golden
in
the
sunset
the
valley
of
the
rhine
with
its
river
a
silvery
streak
running
through
it
and
the
distant
towers
of
worms
it
was
the
great
plain
upon
which
my
young
eyes
rested
when
a
student
in
heidelberg
after
walking
long
among
the
hills
above
the
old
city
i
came
out
upon
a
clearing
and
because
i
was
there
first
conscious
of
beauty
because
there
i
knew
the
first
glow
of
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
each
book
i
read
was
an
extraordinary
adventure
because
there
i
first
knew
the
delight
of
conversation
oh
those
wonderful
commonplaces
which
each
boy
discovers
as
though
none
had
discovered
them
before
because
of
the
morning
stroll
in
the
sunny
anlage
the
cakes
and
coffee
which
refreshed
my
abstemious
youth
at
the
end
of
a
strenuous
walk
the
leisurely
evenings
on
the
castle
terrace
with
the
smoky
blue
haze
over
the
tumbled
roofs
of
the
old
town
below
me
because
of
goethe
and
heine
and
beethoven
and
wagner
and
why
not
strauss
with
his
waltzes
and
the
where
the
band
played
and
girls
with
yellow
plaits
walked
sedately
because
of
all
these
things
recollections
which
have
all
the
force
of
the
appeal
of
sense
to
me
not
only
does
the
word
mean
everywhere
and
exclusively
the
valley
of
the
rhine
but
the
only
symbol
for
happiness
i
know
is
a
wide
prospect
all
golden
in
the
setting
sun
with
a
shining
stream
of
silver
running
through
it
like
the
path
of
life
or
like
the
ideal
that
guides
you
through
it
and
far
away
the
grey
towers
of
an
ancient
town
xlvii
failure
a
little
man
portly
in
a
fantastic
hat
like
a
bushranger
with
an
immense
brim
a
such
as
you
see
in
leech
pictures
of
the
man
and
very
wide
check
trousers
of
a
cut
fashionable
heaven
knows
how
many
years
ago
when
he
takes
off
his
hat
you
see
a
fine
head
of
long
curly
hair
and
though
he
is
approaching
the
sixties
it
is
scarcely
grey
his
features
are
regular
he
wears
a
collar
several
sizes
too
large
for
him
so
that
his
whole
neck
massive
and
statuesque
is
shown
he
has
the
look
of
a
roman
emperor
in
a
tragedy
of
the
sixties
and
this
air
of
an
actor
of
the
old
school
is
enhanced
by
his
deep
booming
voice
his
stumpy
frame
makes
it
slightly
absurd
you
can
imagine
his
declaiming
the
blank
verse
of
sheridan
knowles
with
an
emphasis
to
rouse
the
pit
to
frenzy
and
when
he
greets
you
with
too
large
a
gesture
you
guess
how
that
resonant
organ
would
tremble
when
he
wrung
your
heart
in
over
the
death
of
his
child
it
was
splendid
a
little
later
to
hear
him
ask
the
chinese
servant
for
me
boots
boy
me
boots
a
kingdom
for
me
boots
he
confessed
that
he
should
have
been
an
actor
to
be
or
not
to
be
that
was
the
question
but
me
family
me
family
dear
boy
they
would
have
died
of
the
disgrace
and
so
i
was
exposed
to
the
slings
and
arrows
of
outrageous
fortune
in
short
he
came
out
to
china
as
a
but
he
came
when
the
ceylon
tea
was
already
ousting
the
chinese
and
it
was
no
longer
possible
for
the
merchant
to
enrich
himself
in
a
few
years
but
the
old
lavishness
endured
and
life
was
led
in
a
grand
style
when
the
means
to
pay
for
it
no
longer
existed
the
struggle
became
harder
finally
came
the
war
and
with
the
loss
of
formosa
ruin
the
looked
about
for
other
means
of
livelihood
he
became
a
an
undertaker
an
a
broker
an
auctioneer
he
tried
every
way
of
making
money
that
his
ardent
imagination
suggested
but
with
the
diminishing
prosperity
of
the
port
his
efforts
were
bootless
life
was
too
much
for
him
and
now
at
last
he
had
the
pitiful
air
of
a
broken
man
there
was
even
something
touching
in
it
like
the
appeal
of
a
woman
who
can
not
believe
in
the
loss
of
her
beauty
and
implores
the
compliment
which
reassures
but
no
longer
convinces
her
and
yet
notwithstanding
he
had
a
solace
he
had
still
a
magnificent
assurance
he
was
a
failure
and
he
knew
it
but
it
did
not
really
affect
him
for
he
was
the
victim
of
fate
no
shadow
of
a
doubt
in
his
own
capacity
had
ever
crossed
his
mind
xlviii
a
student
of
the
drama
he
sent
in
a
neat
card
of
the
correct
shape
and
size
deeply
bordered
in
black
upon
which
under
his
name
was
printed
of
comparative
modern
he
turned
out
to
be
a
young
man
small
with
tiny
elegant
hands
with
a
larger
nose
than
you
see
as
a
rule
in
the
chinese
and
gold
rimmed
spectacles
though
it
was
a
warm
day
he
was
dressed
in
european
clothes
in
a
suit
of
heavy
tweed
he
seemed
a
trifle
shy
he
spoke
in
a
high
falsetto
as
though
his
voice
had
never
broken
and
those
shrill
notes
gave
i
know
not
what
feeling
of
unreality
to
his
conversation
he
had
studied
in
geneva
and
in
paris
berlin
and
vienna
and
he
expressed
himself
fluently
in
english
french
and
german
it
appeared
that
he
lectured
on
the
drama
and
he
had
lately
written
in
french
a
work
on
the
chinese
theatre
his
studies
abroad
had
left
him
with
a
surprising
enthusiasm
for
scribe
and
this
was
the
model
he
proposed
for
the
regeneration
of
the
chinese
drama
it
was
curious
to
hear
him
demand
that
the
drama
should
be
exciting
he
was
asking
for
the
bien
the
à
the
curtain
the
unexpected
the
dramatic
the
chinese
theatre
with
its
elaborate
symbolism
has
been
what
we
are
always
crying
for
the
theatre
of
ideas
and
apparently
it
has
been
perishing
of
dullness
it
is
true
that
ideas
do
not
grow
on
every
gooseberry
bush
they
need
novelty
to
make
them
appetising
and
when
they
are
stale
they
stink
as
badly
as
stale
fish
but
then
remembering
the
description
on
the
card
i
asked
my
friend
what
books
english
and
french
he
recommended
his
students
to
read
in
order
to
familiarise
themselves
with
the
current
literature
of
the
day
he
hesitated
a
little
i
really
do
know
he
said
at
last
you
see
that
not
my
branch
i
only
have
to
do
with
drama
but
if
you
interested
i
ask
my
colleague
who
lectures
on
european
fiction
to
call
on
you
i
beg
your
pardon
i
said
have
you
read
he
asked
i
think
that
is
the
finest
play
that
has
been
produced
in
europe
since
scribe
do
you
i
said
politely
yes
you
see
our
students
are
greatly
interested
in
sociological
questions
it
is
my
misfortune
that
i
am
not
and
so
as
deftly
as
i
could
i
led
the
conversation
to
chinese
philosophy
which
i
was
desultorily
reading
i
mentioned
the
professor
jaw
fell
he
lived
a
very
long
time
ago
he
said
perplexed
so
did
aristotle
i
murmured
pleasantly
i
have
never
studied
the
philosophers
he
said
but
of
course
we
have
at
our
university
a
professor
of
chinese
philosophy
and
if
you
are
interested
in
that
i
will
ask
him
to
come
and
call
on
you
it
is
useless
to
argue
with
a
pedagogue
as
the
spirit
of
the
ocean
somewhat
portentously
to
my
mind
remarked
to
the
spirit
of
the
river
and
i
resigned
myself
to
discuss
the
drama
my
professor
was
interested
in
its
technique
and
indeed
was
preparing
a
course
of
lectures
on
the
subject
which
he
seemed
to
think
both
complicated
and
abstruse
he
flattered
me
by
asking
me
what
were
the
secrets
of
the
craft
i
know
only
two
i
answered
one
is
to
have
and
the
other
is
to
stick
to
the
point
does
it
require
no
more
than
that
to
write
a
play
he
inquired
with
a
shade
of
dismay
in
his
tone
you
want
a
certain
knack
i
allowed
but
no
more
than
to
play
billiards
they
lecture
on
the
technique
of
the
drama
in
all
the
important
universities
of
america
said
he
the
americans
are
an
extremely
practical
people
i
answered
i
believe
that
harvard
is
instituting
a
chair
to
instruct
grandmothers
how
to
suck
eggs
i
do
not
think
i
quite
understand
you
if
you
ca
write
a
play
no
one
can
teach
you
and
if
you
can
it
as
easy
as
falling
off
a
log
here
his
face
expressed
a
lively
perplexity
but
i
think
only
because
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
whether
this
operation
came
within
the
province
of
the
professor
of
physics
or
within
that
of
the
professor
of
applied
mechanics
but
if
it
is
so
easy
to
write
a
play
why
do
dramatists
take
so
long
about
it
they
did
you
know
lope
de
la
vega
and
shakespeare
and
a
hundred
others
wrote
copiously
and
with
ease
some
modern
playwrights
have
been
perfectly
illiterate
men
and
have
found
it
an
almost
insuperable
difficulty
to
put
two
sentences
together
a
celebrated
english
dramatist
once
showed
me
a
manuscript
and
i
saw
that
he
had
written
the
question
will
you
have
sugar
in
your
tea
five
times
before
he
could
put
it
in
this
form
a
novelist
would
starve
if
he
could
not
on
the
whole
say
what
he
wanted
to
without
any
beating
about
the
bush
you
would
not
call
ibsen
an
illiterate
man
and
yet
it
is
well
known
that
he
took
two
years
to
write
a
play
it
is
obvious
that
ibsen
found
a
prodigious
difficulty
in
thinking
of
a
plot
he
racked
his
brain
furiously
month
after
month
and
at
last
in
despair
used
the
very
same
that
he
had
used
before
what
do
you
mean
the
professor
cried
his
voice
rising
to
a
shrill
scream
i
do
not
understand
you
at
all
have
you
not
noticed
that
ibsen
uses
the
same
plot
over
and
over
again
a
number
of
people
are
living
in
a
closed
and
stuffy
room
then
some
one
comes
from
the
mountains
or
from
over
the
sea
and
flings
the
window
open
everyone
gets
a
cold
in
the
head
and
the
curtain
falls
i
thought
it
just
possible
that
the
shadow
of
a
smile
might
lighten
for
a
moment
the
professor
grave
face
but
he
knit
his
brows
and
gazed
for
two
minutes
into
space
then
he
rose
i
will
peruse
the
works
of
henrik
ibsen
once
more
with
that
point
of
view
in
mind
he
said
i
did
not
omit
before
he
left
to
put
him
the
question
which
one
earnest
student
of
the
drama
always
puts
another
when
peradventure
they
meet
i
asked
him
namely
what
he
thought
was
the
future
of
the
theatre
i
had
an
idea
that
he
said
oh
hell
but
on
reflection
i
believe
his
exclamation
must
have
been
ciel
he
sighed
he
shook
his
head
he
threw
up
his
elegant
hands
he
looked
the
picture
of
dejection
it
was
certainly
a
comfort
to
find
that
all
thoughtful
people
considered
the
drama
state
in
china
no
less
desperate
than
all
thoughtful
people
consider
it
in
england
xlix
the
taipan
no
one
knew
better
than
he
that
he
was
an
important
person
he
was
number
one
in
not
the
least
important
branch
of
the
most
important
english
firm
in
china
he
had
worked
his
way
up
through
solid
ability
and
he
looked
back
with
a
faint
smile
at
the
callow
clerk
who
had
come
out
to
china
thirty
years
before
when
he
remembered
the
modest
home
he
had
come
from
a
little
red
house
in
a
long
row
of
little
red
houses
in
barnes
a
suburb
which
aiming
desperately
at
the
genteel
achieves
only
a
sordid
melancholy
and
compared
it
with
the
magnificent
stone
mansion
with
its
wide
verandahs
and
spacious
rooms
which
was
at
once
the
office
of
the
company
and
his
own
residence
he
chuckled
with
satisfaction
he
had
come
a
long
way
since
then
he
thought
of
the
high
tea
to
which
he
sat
down
when
he
came
home
from
school
he
was
at
paul
with
his
father
and
mother
and
his
two
sisters
a
slice
of
cold
meat
a
great
deal
of
bread
and
butter
and
plenty
of
milk
in
his
tea
everybody
helping
himself
and
then
he
thought
of
the
state
in
which
now
he
ate
his
evening
meal
he
always
dressed
and
whether
he
was
alone
or
not
he
expected
the
three
boys
to
wait
at
table
his
number
one
boy
knew
exactly
what
he
liked
and
he
never
had
to
bother
himself
with
the
details
of
housekeeping
but
he
always
had
a
set
dinner
with
soup
and
fish
entrée
roast
sweet
and
savoury
so
that
if
he
wanted
to
ask
anyone
in
at
the
last
moment
he
could
he
liked
his
food
and
he
did
not
see
why
when
he
was
alone
he
should
have
less
good
a
dinner
than
when
he
had
a
guest
he
had
indeed
gone
far
that
was
why
he
did
not
care
to
go
home
now
he
had
not
been
to
england
for
ten
years
and
he
took
his
leave
in
japan
or
vancouver
where
he
was
sure
of
meeting
old
friends
from
the
china
coast
he
knew
no
one
at
home
his
sisters
had
married
in
their
own
station
their
husbands
were
clerks
and
their
sons
were
clerks
there
was
nothing
between
him
and
them
they
bored
him
he
satisfied
the
claims
of
relationship
by
sending
them
every
christmas
a
piece
of
fine
silk
some
elaborate
embroidery
or
a
case
of
tea
he
was
not
a
mean
man
and
as
long
as
his
mother
lived
he
had
made
her
an
allowance
but
when
the
time
came
for
him
to
retire
he
had
no
intention
of
going
back
to
england
he
had
seen
too
many
men
do
that
and
he
knew
how
often
it
was
a
failure
he
meant
to
take
a
house
near
the
in
shanghai
what
with
bridge
and
his
ponies
and
golf
he
expected
to
get
through
the
rest
of
his
life
very
comfortably
but
he
had
a
good
many
years
before
he
need
think
of
retiring
in
another
five
or
six
higgins
would
be
going
home
and
then
he
would
take
charge
of
the
head
office
in
shanghai
meanwhile
he
was
very
happy
where
he
was
he
could
save
money
which
you
could
do
in
shanghai
and
have
a
good
time
into
the
bargain
this
place
had
another
advantage
over
shanghai
he
was
the
most
prominent
man
in
the
community
and
what
he
said
went
even
the
consul
took
care
to
keep
on
the
right
side
of
him
once
a
consul
and
he
had
been
at
loggerheads
and
it
was
not
he
who
had
gone
to
the
wall
the
taipan
thrust
out
his
jaw
pugnaciously
as
he
thought
of
the
incident
but
he
smiled
for
he
felt
in
an
excellent
humour
he
was
walking
back
to
his
office
from
a
capital
luncheon
at
the
and
shanghai
bank
they
did
you
very
well
there
the
food
was
first
rate
and
there
was
plenty
of
liquor
he
had
started
with
a
couple
of
cocktails
then
he
had
some
excellent
sauterne
and
he
had
finished
up
with
two
glasses
of
port
and
some
fine
old
brandy
he
felt
good
and
when
he
left
he
did
a
thing
that
was
rare
with
him
he
walked
his
bearers
with
his
chair
kept
a
few
paces
behind
him
in
case
he
felt
inclined
to
slip
into
it
but
he
enjoyed
stretching
his
legs
he
did
not
get
enough
exercise
these
days
now
that
he
was
too
heavy
to
ride
it
was
difficult
to
get
exercise
but
if
he
was
too
heavy
to
ride
he
could
still
keep
ponies
and
as
he
strolled
along
in
the
balmy
air
he
thought
of
the
spring
meeting
he
had
a
couple
of
griffins
that
he
had
hopes
of
and
one
of
the
lads
in
his
office
had
turned
out
a
fine
jockey
he
must
see
they
did
sneak
him
away
old
higgins
in
shanghai
would
give
a
pot
of
money
to
get
him
over
there
and
he
ought
to
pull
off
two
or
three
races
he
flattered
himself
that
he
had
the
finest
stable
in
the
city
he
pouted
his
broad
chest
like
a
pigeon
it
was
a
beautiful
day
and
it
was
good
to
be
alive
he
paused
as
he
came
to
the
cemetery
it
stood
there
neat
and
orderly
as
an
evident
sign
of
the
community
opulence
he
never
passed
the
cemetery
without
a
little
glow
of
pride
he
was
pleased
to
be
an
englishman
for
the
cemetery
stood
in
a
place
valueless
when
it
was
chosen
which
with
the
increase
of
the
city
affluence
was
now
worth
a
great
deal
of
money
it
had
been
suggested
that
the
graves
should
be
moved
to
another
spot
and
the
land
sold
for
building
but
the
feeling
of
the
community
was
against
it
it
gave
the
taipan
a
sense
of
satisfaction
to
think
that
their
dead
rested
on
the
most
valuable
site
on
the
island
it
showed
that
there
were
things
they
cared
for
more
than
money
money
be
blowed
when
it
came
to
the
things
that
mattered
this
was
a
favourite
phrase
with
the
taipan
well
one
remembered
that
money
was
everything
and
now
he
thought
he
would
take
a
stroll
through
he
looked
at
the
graves
they
were
neatly
kept
and
the
pathways
were
free
from
weeds
there
was
a
look
of
prosperity
and
as
he
sauntered
along
he
read
the
names
on
the
tombstones
here
were
three
side
by
side
the
captain
the
first
mate
and
the
second
mate
of
the
barque
who
had
all
perished
together
in
the
typhoon
of
he
remembered
it
well
there
was
a
little
group
of
two
missionaries
their
wives
and
children
who
had
been
massacred
during
the
boxer
troubles
shocking
thing
that
had
been
not
that
he
took
much
stock
in
missionaries
but
hang
it
all
one
could
have
these
damned
chinese
massacring
them
then
he
came
to
a
cross
with
a
name
on
it
he
knew
good
chap
edward
mulock
but
he
could
stand
his
liquor
drank
himself
to
death
poor
devil
at
the
taipan
had
known
a
lot
of
them
do
that
there
were
several
more
neat
crosses
with
a
man
name
on
them
and
the
age
or
it
was
always
the
same
story
they
had
come
out
to
china
they
had
never
seen
so
much
money
before
they
were
good
fellows
and
they
wanted
to
drink
with
the
rest
they
could
stand
it
and
there
they
were
in
the
cemetery
you
had
to
have
a
strong
head
and
a
fine
constitution
to
drink
drink
for
drink
on
the
china
coast
of
course
it
was
very
sad
but
the
taipan
could
hardly
help
a
smile
when
he
thought
how
many
of
those
young
fellows
he
had
drunk
underground
and
there
was
a
death
that
had
been
useful
a
fellow
in
his
own
firm
senior
to
him
and
a
clever
chap
too
if
that
fellow
had
lived
he
might
not
have
been
taipan
now
truly
the
ways
of
fate
were
inscrutable
ah
and
here
was
little
turner
violet
turner
she
had
been
a
pretty
little
thing
he
had
had
quite
an
affair
with
her
he
had
been
devilish
cut
up
when
she
died
he
looked
at
her
age
on
the
tombstone
she
be
no
chicken
if
she
were
alive
now
and
as
he
thought
of
all
those
dead
people
a
sense
of
satisfaction
spread
through
him
he
had
beaten
them
all
they
were
dead
and
he
was
alive
and
by
george
he
scored
them
off
his
eyes
collected
in
one
picture
all
those
crowded
graves
and
he
smiled
scornfully
he
very
nearly
rubbed
his
hands
no
one
ever
thought
i
was
a
fool
he
muttered
he
had
a
feeling
of
contempt
for
the
gibbering
dead
then
as
he
strolled
along
he
came
suddenly
upon
two
coolies
digging
a
grave
he
was
astonished
for
he
had
not
heard
that
anyone
in
the
community
was
dead
who
the
devil
that
for
he
said
aloud
the
coolies
did
not
even
look
at
him
they
went
on
with
their
work
standing
in
the
grave
deep
down
and
they
shovelled
up
heavy
clods
of
earth
though
he
had
been
so
long
in
china
he
knew
no
chinese
in
his
day
it
was
not
thought
necessary
to
learn
the
damned
language
and
he
asked
the
coolies
in
english
whose
grave
they
were
digging
they
did
not
understand
they
answered
him
in
chinese
and
he
cursed
them
for
ignorant
fools
he
knew
that
broome
child
was
ailing
and
it
might
have
died
but
he
would
certainly
have
heard
of
it
and
besides
that
was
a
child
grave
it
was
a
man
and
a
big
man
too
it
was
uncanny
he
wished
he
had
gone
into
that
cemetery
he
hurried
out
and
stepped
into
his
chair
his
good
humour
had
all
gone
and
there
was
an
uneasy
frown
on
his
face
the
moment
he
got
back
to
his
office
he
called
to
his
number
two
i
say
peters
who
dead
know
but
peters
knew
nothing
the
taipan
was
puzzled
he
called
one
of
the
native
clerks
and
sent
him
to
the
cemetery
to
ask
the
coolies
he
began
to
sign
his
letters
the
clerk
came
back
and
said
the
coolies
had
gone
and
there
was
no
one
to
ask
the
taipan
began
to
feel
vaguely
annoyed
he
did
not
like
things
to
happen
of
which
he
knew
nothing
his
own
boy
would
know
his
boy
always
knew
everything
and
he
sent
for
him
but
the
boy
had
heard
of
no
death
in
the
community
i
knew
no
one
was
dead
said
the
taipan
irritably
but
what
the
grave
for
he
told
the
boy
to
go
to
the
overseer
of
the
cemetery
and
find
out
what
the
devil
he
had
dug
a
grave
for
when
no
one
was
dead
let
me
have
a
whisky
and
soda
before
you
go
he
added
as
the
boy
was
leaving
the
room
he
did
not
know
why
the
sight
of
the
grave
had
made
him
uncomfortable
but
he
tried
to
put
it
out
of
his
mind
he
felt
better
when
he
had
drunk
the
whisky
and
he
finished
his
work
he
went
upstairs
and
turned
over
the
pages
of
in
a
few
minutes
he
would
go
to
the
club
and
play
a
rubber
or
two
of
bridge
before
dinner
but
it
would
ease
his
mind
to
hear
what
his
boy
had
to
say
and
he
waited
for
his
return
in
a
little
while
the
boy
came
back
and
he
brought
the
overseer
with
him
what
are
you
having
a
grave
dug
for
he
asked
the
overseer
point
blank
nobody
dead
i
no
dig
glave
said
the
man
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
by
that
there
were
two
coolies
digging
a
grave
this
afternoon
the
two
chinese
looked
at
one
another
then
the
boy
said
they
had
been
to
the
cemetery
together
there
was
no
new
grave
there
the
taipan
only
just
stopped
himself
from
speaking
but
damn
it
all
i
saw
it
myself
were
the
words
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
but
he
did
not
say
them
he
grew
very
red
as
he
choked
them
down
the
two
chinese
looked
at
him
with
their
steady
eyes
for
a
moment
his
breath
failed
him
all
right
get
out
he
gasped
but
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
he
shouted
for
the
boy
again
and
when
he
came
maddeningly
impassive
he
told
him
to
bring
some
whisky
he
rubbed
his
sweating
face
with
a
handkerchief
his
hand
trembled
when
he
lifted
the
glass
to
his
lips
they
could
say
what
they
liked
but
he
had
seen
the
grave
why
he
could
hear
still
the
dull
thud
as
the
coolies
threw
the
spadefuls
of
earth
on
the
ground
above
them
what
did
it
mean
he
could
feel
his
heart
beating
he
felt
strangely
ill
at
ease
but
he
pulled
himself
together
it
was
all
nonsense
if
there
was
no
grave
there
it
must
have
been
an
hallucination
the
best
thing
he
could
do
was
to
go
to
the
club
and
if
he
ran
across
the
doctor
he
would
ask
him
to
give
him
a
look
over
everyone
in
the
club
looked
just
the
same
as
ever
he
did
not
know
why
he
should
have
expected
them
to
look
different
it
was
a
comfort
these
men
living
for
many
years
with
one
another
lives
that
were
methodically
regulated
had
acquired
a
number
of
little
idiosyncrasies
one
of
them
hummed
incessantly
while
he
played
bridge
another
insisted
on
drinking
beer
through
a
straw
and
these
tricks
which
had
so
often
irritated
the
taipan
now
gave
him
a
sense
of
security
he
needed
it
for
he
could
not
get
out
of
his
head
that
strange
sight
he
had
seen
he
played
bridge
very
badly
his
partner
was
censorious
and
the
taipan
lost
his
temper
he
thought
the
men
were
looking
at
him
oddly
he
wondered
what
they
saw
in
him
that
was
unaccustomed
suddenly
he
felt
he
could
not
bear
to
stay
in
the
club
any
longer
as
he
went
out
he
saw
the
doctor
reading
in
the
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
speak
to
him
he
wanted
to
see
for
himself
whether
that
grave
was
really
there
and
stepping
into
his
chair
he
told
his
bearers
to
take
him
to
the
cemetery
you
could
have
an
hallucination
twice
could
you
and
besides
he
would
take
the
overseer
in
with
him
and
if
the
grave
was
not
there
he
would
see
it
and
if
it
was
he
give
the
overseer
the
soundest
thrashing
he
ever
had
but
the
overseer
was
nowhere
to
be
found
he
had
gone
out
and
taken
the
keys
with
him
when
the
taipan
found
he
could
not
get
into
the
cemetery
he
felt
suddenly
exhausted
he
got
back
into
his
chair
and
told
his
bearers
to
take
him
home
he
would
lie
down
for
half
an
hour
before
dinner
he
was
tired
out
that
was
it
he
had
heard
that
people
had
hallucinations
when
they
were
tired
when
his
boy
came
in
to
put
out
his
clothes
for
dinner
it
was
only
by
an
effort
of
will
that
he
got
up
he
had
a
strong
inclination
not
to
dress
that
evening
but
he
resisted
it
he
made
it
a
rule
to
dress
he
had
dressed
every
evening
for
twenty
years
and
it
would
never
do
to
break
his
rule
but
he
ordered
a
bottle
of
champagne
with
his
dinner
and
that
made
him
feel
more
comfortable
afterwards
he
told
the
boy
to
bring
him
the
best
brandy
when
he
had
drunk
a
couple
of
glasses
of
this
he
felt
himself
again
hallucinations
be
damned
he
went
to
the
billiard
room
and
practised
a
few
difficult
shots
there
could
not
be
much
the
matter
with
him
when
his
eye
was
so
sure
when
he
went
to
bed
he
sank
immediately
into
a
sound
sleep
but
suddenly
he
awoke
he
had
dreamed
of
that
open
grave
and
the
coolies
digging
leisurely
he
was
sure
he
had
seen
them
it
was
absurd
to
say
it
was
an
hallucination
when
he
had
seen
them
with
his
own
eyes
then
he
heard
the
rattle
of
the
night
watchman
going
his
rounds
it
broke
upon
the
stillness
of
the
night
so
harshly
that
it
made
him
jump
out
of
his
skin
and
then
terror
seized
him
he
felt
a
horror
of
the
winding
multitudinous
streets
of
the
chinese
city
and
there
was
something
ghastly
and
terrible
in
the
convoluted
roofs
of
the
temples
with
their
devils
grimacing
and
tortured
he
loathed
the
smells
that
assaulted
his
nostrils
and
the
people
those
myriads
of
blue
clad
coolies
and
the
beggars
in
their
filthy
rags
and
the
merchants
and
the
magistrates
sleek
smiling
and
inscrutable
in
their
long
black
gowns
they
seemed
to
press
upon
him
with
menace
he
hated
the
country
china
why
had
he
ever
come
he
was
now
he
must
get
out
he
would
not
stay
another
year
another
month
what
did
he
care
about
shanghai
oh
my
god
he
cried
if
i
were
only
safely
back
in
england
he
wanted
to
go
home
if
he
had
to
die
he
wanted
to
die
in
england
he
could
not
bear
to
be
buried
among
all
these
yellow
men
with
their
slanting
eyes
and
their
grinning
faces
he
wanted
to
be
buried
at
home
not
in
that
grave
he
had
seen
that
day
he
could
never
rest
there
never
what
did
it
matter
what
people
thought
let
them
think
what
they
liked
the
only
thing
that
mattered
was
to
get
away
while
he
had
the
chance
he
got
out
of
bed
and
wrote
to
the
head
of
the
firm
and
said
he
had
discovered
he
was
dangerously
ill
he
must
be
replaced
he
could
not
stay
longer
than
was
absolutely
necessary
he
must
go
home
at
once
they
found
the
letter
in
the
morning
clenched
in
the
taipan
hand
he
had
slipped
down
between
the
desk
and
the
chair
he
was
stone
dead
l
metempsychosis
he
was
decently
though
far
from
richly
clad
he
had
a
small
round
cap
of
black
silk
on
his
head
and
on
his
feet
black
silk
shoes
his
robe
was
pale
green
of
the
flowered
silk
which
is
made
in
and
over
it
he
wore
a
short
black
jacket
he
was
an
old
man
with
a
white
beard
long
and
for
a
chinese
full
his
broad
face
much
wrinkled
especially
between
the
brows
was
benign
and
his
large
horn
spectacles
did
not
conceal
the
friendliness
of
his
eyes
he
had
all
the
look
of
one
of
those
sages
whom
you
may
see
in
an
old
picture
seated
by
a
bamboo
grove
at
the
foot
of
a
great
rocky
mountain
contemplating
the
eternal
way
but
now
his
face
bore
an
expression
of
great
annoyance
and
his
kindly
eyes
were
frowning
for
he
was
engaged
in
the
singular
occupation
for
a
man
of
his
appearance
of
leading
a
little
black
pig
along
the
causeway
between
the
flooded
padi
fields
and
the
little
black
pig
with
sudden
jerks
with
unexpected
dodging
ran
hither
and
thither
in
every
direction
but
that
in
which
the
old
gentleman
wished
to
go
he
pulled
the
string
violently
but
the
pig
squealing
refused
to
follow
he
addressed
it
in
terms
of
expostulation
and
of
abuse
but
the
little
pig
sat
on
his
haunches
and
looked
at
him
with
malicious
eyes
then
i
knew
that
in
the
tang
dynasty
the
old
gentleman
had
been
a
philosopher
who
had
juggled
with
facts
as
philosophers
will
making
them
suit
the
whims
which
he
called
his
theories
and
now
after
who
knows
how
many
existences
he
was
expiating
his
sins
in
suffering
in
his
turn
the
stubborn
tyranny
of
the
facts
which
he
had
outraged
li
the
fragment
when
you
travel
in
china
i
think
nothing
amazes
you
more
than
the
passion
for
decoration
which
possesses
the
chinese
it
is
not
astonishing
that
you
should
find
decoration
in
memorial
arches
or
in
temples
here
the
occasion
for
it
is
obvious
and
it
is
natural
enough
to
find
it
in
furniture
nor
does
it
surprise
though
it
delights
you
to
discover
it
on
the
commoner
objects
of
household
use
the
pewter
pot
is
enriched
with
a
graceful
design
the
coolie
rice
bowl
has
its
rough
but
not
inelegant
adornment
you
may
fancy
that
the
chinese
craftsman
does
not
look
upon
an
article
as
complete
till
by
line
or
colour
he
has
broken
the
plainness
of
a
surface
he
will
even
print
an
arabesque
on
the
paper
he
uses
for
wrapping
but
it
is
more
unexpected
when
you
see
the
elaborate
embellishment
of
a
the
splendid
carving
gilt
or
relieved
with
gold
of
its
counter
and
the
intricate
sculpture
of
the
signboard
it
may
be
that
this
magnificence
serves
as
an
advertisement
but
it
does
so
only
because
the
the
possible
customer
takes
pleasure
in
elegance
and
you
are
apt
to
think
that
the
tradesman
who
owns
the
shop
takes
pleasure
in
it
too
when
he
sits
at
his
door
smoking
his
water
pipe
and
through
his
great
horn
spectacles
reading
a
newspaper
his
eyes
must
rest
with
good
humour
sometimes
on
the
fantastic
ornamentation
on
the
counter
in
a
pot
stands
a
solitary
carnation
you
will
find
the
same
delight
in
the
ornate
in
the
poorest
villages
where
the
severity
of
a
door
is
mitigated
by
a
charming
piece
of
carving
and
where
the
trellis
of
the
windows
forms
a
complicated
and
graceful
pattern
you
can
seldom
cross
a
bridge
in
however
unfrequented
a
district
without
seeing
in
it
the
hand
of
an
artist
the
stones
are
so
laid
as
to
make
an
intricate
decoration
and
it
seems
as
though
these
singular
people
judged
with
a
careful
eye
whether
a
flat
bridge
or
an
arched
one
would
fit
in
best
with
the
surrounding
scene
the
balustrade
is
ornamented
with
lions
or
with
dragons
i
remember
a
bridge
that
must
have
been
placed
just
where
it
was
for
the
pure
delight
of
its
beauty
rather
than
for
any
useful
purpose
since
though
broad
enough
for
a
carriage
and
pair
to
pass
over
it
it
served
only
to
connect
a
narrow
path
that
led
from
one
ragged
village
to
another
the
nearest
town
was
thirty
miles
away
the
broad
river
narrowing
at
this
point
flowed
between
two
green
hills
and
nut
trees
grew
on
the
bank
the
bridge
had
no
balustrade
it
was
constructed
of
immense
slabs
of
granite
and
rested
on
five
piers
the
middle
pier
consisted
of
a
huge
and
fantastic
dragon
with
a
long
and
scaly
tail
on
the
sides
of
the
outer
slabs
running
the
whole
length
of
the
bridge
was
cut
in
very
low
relief
a
pattern
of
an
unimaginable
lightness
delicacy
and
grace
but
though
the
chinese
take
such
careful
pains
to
avoid
fatiguing
your
eye
with
sure
taste
making
the
elaborateness
of
a
decoration
endurable
by
contrasting
it
with
a
plain
surface
in
the
end
weariness
overcomes
you
their
exuberance
bewilders
you
can
not
refuse
your
admiration
to
the
ingenuity
with
which
they
so
diversify
the
ideas
that
occupy
them
as
to
give
you
an
impression
of
changing
fantasy
but
the
fact
is
plain
that
the
ideas
are
few
the
chinese
artist
is
like
a
fiddler
who
with
infinite
skill
should
play
infinite
variations
upon
a
single
tune
now
i
happened
upon
a
french
doctor
who
had
been
in
practice
for
many
years
in
the
city
in
which
i
then
found
myself
and
he
was
a
collector
of
porcelain
bronze
and
embroidery
he
took
me
to
see
his
things
they
were
beautiful
but
they
were
a
trifle
monotonous
i
admired
perfunctorily
suddenly
i
came
upon
the
fragment
of
a
bust
but
that
is
greek
i
said
in
surprise
do
you
think
so
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
it
head
and
arms
were
gone
and
the
statue
for
such
it
had
been
was
broken
off
just
above
the
waist
but
there
was
a
breastplate
with
a
sun
in
the
middle
of
it
and
in
relief
perseus
killing
the
dragon
it
was
a
fragment
of
no
great
importance
but
it
was
greek
and
perhaps
because
i
was
surfeited
with
chinese
beauty
it
affected
me
strangely
it
spoke
in
a
tongue
with
which
i
was
familiar
it
rested
my
heart
i
passed
my
hands
over
its
surface
with
a
delight
i
was
myself
surprised
at
i
was
like
a
sailor
who
wandering
in
a
tropic
sea
has
known
the
lazy
loveliness
of
coral
islands
and
the
splendours
of
the
cities
of
the
east
but
finds
himself
once
more
in
the
dingy
alleys
of
a
channel
port
it
is
cold
and
grey
and
sordid
but
it
is
england
the
doctor
he
was
a
little
bald
man
with
gleaming
eyes
and
an
excitable
manner
rubbed
his
hands
do
you
know
it
was
found
within
thirty
miles
of
here
on
this
side
of
the
tibetan
frontier
found
i
exclaimed
found
where
in
the
ground
it
had
been
buried
for
two
thousand
years
they
found
this
and
several
fragments
more
one
or
two
complete
statues
i
believe
but
they
were
broken
up
and
only
this
remained
it
was
incredible
that
greek
statues
should
have
been
discovered
in
so
remote
a
spot
but
what
is
your
explanation
i
asked
i
think
this
was
a
statue
of
alexander
he
said
by
george
it
was
a
thrill
was
it
possible
that
one
of
the
commanders
of
the
macedonian
after
the
expedition
into
india
had
found
his
way
into
this
mysterious
corner
of
china
under
the
shadow
of
the
mountains
of
tibet
the
doctor
wanted
to
show
me
manchu
dresses
but
i
could
not
give
them
my
attention
what
bold
adventurer
was
he
who
had
penetrated
so
far
towards
the
east
to
found
a
kingdom
there
he
had
built
a
temple
to
aphrodite
and
a
temple
to
dionysus
and
in
the
theatre
actors
had
sung
the
antigone
and
in
his
halls
at
night
bards
had
recited
the
odyssey
and
he
and
his
men
listening
may
have
felt
themselves
the
peers
of
the
old
seaman
and
his
followers
what
magnificence
did
that
stained
fragment
of
marble
call
up
and
what
fabulous
adventures
how
long
had
the
kingdom
lasted
and
what
tragedy
marked
its
fall
ah
just
then
i
could
not
look
at
tibetan
banners
or
celadon
cups
for
i
saw
the
parthenon
severe
and
lovely
and
beyond
serene
the
blue
ægean
lii
one
of
the
best
i
could
never
remember
his
name
but
whenever
he
was
spoken
of
in
the
port
he
was
always
described
as
one
of
the
best
he
was
a
man
of
fifty
perhaps
thin
and
rather
tall
dapper
and
with
a
small
neat
head
and
sharp
features
his
blue
eyes
were
and
jovial
behind
his
he
was
of
a
cheerful
disposition
and
he
had
a
vein
of
banter
which
was
not
ineffective
he
could
turn
out
the
sort
of
jokes
that
make
men
standing
at
the
club
bar
laugh
heartily
and
he
could
be
agreeably
malicious
but
without
about
any
member
of
the
community
who
did
not
happen
to
be
present
his
humour
was
of
the
same
nature
as
that
of
the
comedian
in
a
musical
play
when
they
spoke
of
him
they
often
said
you
know
i
wonder
he
never
went
on
the
stage
he
have
made
a
hit
one
of
the
best
he
was
always
ready
to
have
a
drink
with
you
and
no
sooner
was
your
glass
empty
than
he
was
prompt
with
the
china
phrase
ready
for
the
other
half
but
he
did
not
drink
more
than
was
good
for
him
oh
he
got
his
head
screwed
on
his
shoulders
the
right
way
they
said
one
of
the
best
when
the
hat
was
passed
round
for
some
charitable
object
he
could
always
be
counted
on
to
give
as
much
as
anyone
else
and
he
was
always
ready
to
go
in
for
a
golf
competition
or
a
billiards
tournament
he
was
a
bachelor
marriage
is
no
use
to
a
man
who
lives
in
china
he
said
he
has
to
send
his
wife
away
every
summer
and
then
when
the
kids
are
beginning
to
be
interesting
they
have
to
go
home
it
costs
a
deuce
of
a
lot
of
money
and
you
get
nothing
out
of
it
but
he
was
always
willing
to
do
a
good
turn
to
any
woman
in
the
community
he
was
number
one
at
jardine
and
he
often
had
the
power
to
make
himself
useful
he
had
been
in
china
for
thirty
years
and
he
prided
himself
on
not
speaking
a
word
of
chinese
he
never
went
into
the
chinese
city
his
compradore
was
chinese
and
some
of
the
clerks
his
boys
of
course
and
the
chair
coolies
but
they
were
the
only
chinese
he
had
anything
to
do
with
and
quite
enough
too
i
hate
the
country
i
hate
the
people
he
said
as
soon
as
saved
enough
money
i
mean
to
clear
out
he
laughed
do
you
know
last
time
i
was
home
i
found
everyone
cracked
over
chinese
junk
pictures
and
porcelain
and
stuff
do
talk
to
me
about
chinese
things
i
said
to
i
never
want
to
see
anything
chinese
as
long
as
i
live
he
turned
to
me
i
tell
you
what
i
do
believe
i
got
a
single
chinese
thing
in
my
house
but
if
you
wanted
him
to
talk
to
you
about
london
he
was
prepared
to
do
so
by
the
hour
he
knew
all
the
musical
comedies
that
had
been
played
for
twenty
years
and
at
the
distance
of
nine
thousand
miles
he
was
able
to
keep
up
with
the
doings
of
miss
lily
elsie
and
miss
elsie
janis
he
played
the
piano
and
he
had
a
pleasing
voice
it
required
little
persuasion
to
induce
him
to
sit
down
and
sing
you
the
popular
ditties
he
had
heard
when
last
he
was
at
home
it
was
quite
singular
to
me
the
unfathomable
frivolity
of
this
man
it
was
even
a
little
uncanny
but
people
applauded
him
loudly
when
he
finished
he
priceless
is
he
they
said
oh
one
of
the
best
liii
the
ships
captains
for
the
most
part
are
very
dull
men
their
conversation
is
of
freights
and
cargoes
they
have
seen
little
more
in
the
ports
they
visit
than
their
agent
office
the
bar
which
their
kind
frequents
and
the
bawdy
houses
they
owe
the
glamour
of
romance
which
their
connection
with
the
sea
has
cast
over
them
to
the
imagination
of
the
landsman
to
them
the
sea
is
a
means
of
livelihood
and
they
know
it
as
an
knows
his
engine
from
a
standpoint
which
is
aridly
practical
they
are
men
working
men
of
a
narrow
outlook
with
small
education
for
the
most
part
and
little
culture
they
are
all
of
a
piece
and
they
have
neither
subtlety
nor
imagination
straightforward
courageous
honest
and
reliable
they
stand
on
the
immutability
of
the
obvious
and
they
are
definite
they
are
placed
in
their
surroundings
like
the
objects
in
a
stereoscopic
photograph
so
that
you
seem
to
see
all
round
them
they
offer
themselves
to
you
with
salient
traits
but
no
one
could
have
adhered
less
to
type
than
captain
boots
he
was
the
master
of
a
little
chinese
steamer
on
the
upper
yangtze
and
because
i
was
his
only
passenger
we
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
in
one
company
but
though
he
was
fluent
of
speech
garrulous
even
i
see
him
shadowly
and
he
remains
in
my
mind
indistinctly
i
suppose
it
is
on
account
of
his
elusiveness
that
he
engages
my
imagination
there
was
certainly
nothing
elusive
in
his
appearance
he
was
a
big
man
six
foot
two
powerfully
built
with
large
features
and
a
red
friendly
face
when
he
laughed
he
showed
a
row
of
handsome
gold
teeth
he
was
very
bald
and
but
he
had
the
most
bushy
abundant
and
aggressive
eyebrows
that
i
have
ever
seen
and
under
them
mild
blue
eyes
he
was
a
dutchman
and
though
he
had
left
holland
when
he
was
eight
he
still
spoke
with
an
accent
he
could
not
pronounce
th
but
always
made
it
his
father
a
fisherman
who
sailed
his
own
schooner
on
the
zuyder
zee
hearing
that
fishing
was
good
in
newfoundland
had
set
out
with
his
wife
and
his
two
sons
across
the
broad
atlantic
after
some
years
there
and
in
hudson
bay
all
this
was
hard
on
half
a
century
ago
they
had
sailed
round
the
horn
for
the
behring
straits
they
hunted
seal
until
the
law
stepped
in
to
save
the
beasts
they
were
exterminating
and
then
boots
a
man
now
and
a
brave
one
god
knows
sailed
here
and
there
as
third
then
as
second
mate
on
sailing
vessels
he
had
been
almost
all
his
life
in
sail
and
now
on
a
steamer
could
not
make
himself
at
home
it
only
in
a
sailing
boat
you
get
comfort
he
said
dere
no
comfort
anywhere
when
you
got
steam
he
had
been
all
along
the
coast
of
south
america
after
nitrates
then
to
the
west
coast
of
africa
then
again
fishing
cod
off
the
coast
of
maine
to
america
and
after
that
with
cargoes
of
salt
fish
to
spain
and
portugal
a
tavern
acquaintance
in
manila
suggested
that
he
should
try
the
chinese
customs
he
went
to
where
he
was
taken
on
as
a
and
presently
was
put
in
command
of
a
steam
launch
he
spent
three
years
chasing
the
opium
smugglers
and
then
having
saved
a
little
money
built
himself
a
ton
schooner
with
which
he
determined
to
go
to
the
behring
straits
and
try
his
luck
again
with
the
seal
fishery
but
i
guess
my
crew
got
scared
he
said
when
i
got
to
shanghai
they
deserted
and
i
could
get
no
oder
so
i
had
to
sell
de
boat
and
i
shipped
on
a
vessel
what
was
going
to
vancouver
it
was
then
he
first
left
the
sea
he
met
a
man
who
was
pushing
a
patent
and
this
he
agreed
to
take
round
the
states
it
was
a
queer
occupation
for
a
and
it
was
not
a
successful
one
for
at
salt
lake
city
the
firm
that
employed
him
having
gone
bankrupt
he
found
himself
stranded
somehow
or
other
he
got
back
to
vancouver
but
he
was
taken
with
the
idea
of
life
ashore
and
he
found
work
with
an
it
was
his
duty
to
take
the
purchasers
of
land
to
their
plots
and
if
they
were
not
satisfied
persuade
them
that
they
need
not
regret
their
bargain
we
sold
one
fellow
a
farm
on
de
side
of
a
mountain
he
said
his
blue
eyes
twinkling
at
the
recollection
an
it
was
so
steep
dat
de
chickens
had
one
leg
longer
dan
de
oder
after
five
years
he
had
the
idea
that
he
would
like
to
go
back
to
china
he
had
no
difficulty
in
getting
a
job
as
mate
of
a
ship
sailing
west
and
soon
he
was
at
the
old
life
once
more
since
then
he
had
been
on
most
of
the
china
runs
from
vladivostok
to
shanghai
from
amoy
to
manila
and
on
all
the
big
rivers
on
steamers
now
rising
from
second
to
first
mate
and
at
last
on
chinese
owned
ships
to
master
he
talked
willingly
of
his
plans
for
the
future
he
had
been
in
china
long
enough
and
he
hankered
after
a
farm
on
the
fraser
river
he
would
build
himself
a
boat
and
do
a
bit
of
fishing
salmon
and
halibut
it
time
i
settled
down
he
said
years
i
been
to
sea
an
i
should
wonder
but
what
i
did
a
bit
of
boat
building
too
i
not
one
to
stick
to
one
ding
there
he
was
right
and
this
restlessness
of
his
translated
itself
into
a
curious
indecision
of
character
there
was
something
fluid
about
him
so
that
you
did
not
know
where
to
take
hold
of
him
he
reminded
you
of
a
scene
of
mist
and
rain
in
a
japanese
print
where
the
design
barely
suggested
almost
escapes
you
he
had
a
peculiar
gentleness
which
was
somewhat
unexpected
in
the
rough
old
salt
i
do
want
to
offend
anyone
he
said
treat
kindly
what
i
try
to
do
if
people
wo
do
what
you
want
talk
to
nicely
persuade
dere
no
need
to
be
nasty
try
what
coaxing
do
it
was
a
principle
which
it
was
unusual
to
find
used
with
the
chinese
and
i
do
not
know
that
it
answered
very
well
for
after
some
difficulty
he
would
come
into
the
cabin
wave
his
hands
and
say
i
can
do
noding
wid
dem
dey
wo
listen
to
reason
and
then
his
moderation
looked
very
like
weakness
but
he
was
no
fool
he
had
a
sense
of
humour
at
one
place
we
were
drawing
over
seven
feet
and
since
the
river
at
its
shallowest
was
barely
that
and
the
course
was
dangerous
the
harbour
authorities
would
not
give
us
our
papers
till
part
of
the
cargo
was
unloaded
it
was
the
ship
last
trip
and
she
was
carrying
the
pay
of
regiments
stationed
several
days
down
stream
the
military
governor
refused
to
let
the
ship
start
unless
the
bullion
was
taken
i
guess
i
got
to
do
what
you
tell
me
said
captain
boots
to
the
harbour
master
you
do
get
your
papers
till
i
see
the
five
foot
mark
above
the
water
answered
the
harbour
master
i
tell
the
compradore
to
take
out
some
of
dat
silver
he
took
the
harbour
master
up
to
the
customs
club
and
stood
him
drinks
while
this
was
being
done
he
drank
with
him
for
four
hours
and
when
he
returned
he
walked
as
steadily
as
when
he
went
but
the
was
drunk
ah
i
see
dey
got
it
down
two
foot
said
captain
boots
dat
all
right
den
the
looked
at
the
numbers
on
the
ship
side
and
sure
enough
the
five
foot
mark
was
at
the
water
edge
that
good
he
said
and
now
you
can
go
i
be
off
right
away
said
the
captain
not
a
pound
of
cargo
had
been
removed
but
an
astute
chinaman
had
neatly
repainted
the
numbers
and
later
when
mutinous
regiments
with
an
eye
on
the
silver
we
carried
sought
to
prevent
us
from
leaving
one
of
the
riverside
cities
he
showed
an
agreeable
firmness
his
equable
temper
was
tried
and
he
said
no
one
going
to
make
me
stay
where
i
do
want
to
i
de
master
of
dis
ship
and
i
de
man
what
gives
de
orders
i
going
the
agitated
compradore
said
the
military
would
fire
if
we
attempted
to
move
an
officer
uttered
a
command
and
the
soldiers
going
down
on
one
knee
levelled
their
rifles
captain
boots
looked
at
them
put
down
de
bullet
proof
screen
he
said
i
tell
you
i
going
and
de
chinese
army
can
go
to
hell
he
gave
his
orders
to
raise
the
anchor
and
at
the
same
time
the
officer
gave
the
order
to
fire
captain
boots
stood
on
his
bridge
a
somewhat
grotesque
figure
for
in
his
old
blue
jersey
with
his
red
face
and
burly
frame
he
looked
the
very
image
of
those
ancient
fishermen
that
you
see
lounging
about
grimsby
docks
and
he
rang
his
bell
we
steamed
out
slowly
to
the
spatter
of
rifle
shots
liv
the
question
they
took
me
to
the
temple
it
stood
on
the
side
of
a
hill
with
a
of
tawny
mountains
behind
it
staging
it
as
it
were
with
a
formal
grandeur
and
they
pointed
out
to
me
with
what
exquisite
art
the
series
of
buildings
climbed
the
hill
till
you
reached
the
final
edifice
a
jewel
of
white
marble
encircled
by
the
trees
for
the
chinese
architect
sought
to
make
his
creation
an
ornament
to
nature
and
he
used
the
accidents
of
the
landscape
to
complete
his
decorative
scheme
they
pointed
out
to
me
how
cunningly
the
trees
were
planted
to
contrast
with
the
marble
of
a
gateway
to
give
an
agreeable
shadow
here
or
there
to
serve
as
a
background
and
they
made
me
remark
the
admirable
proportion
of
those
great
roofs
rising
one
beyond
the
other
in
rich
profusion
with
the
grace
of
flowers
and
they
showed
me
that
the
yellow
tiles
were
of
different
hues
so
that
the
sensibility
was
not
offended
by
an
expanse
of
colour
but
amused
and
pleased
by
a
subtle
variety
of
tone
they
showed
me
how
the
elaborate
carving
of
a
gateway
was
contrasted
with
a
surface
without
adornment
so
that
the
eye
was
not
wearied
all
this
they
showed
me
as
we
walked
through
elegant
courtyards
over
bridges
which
were
a
miracle
of
grace
through
temples
with
strange
gods
dark
and
gesticulating
but
when
i
asked
them
what
was
the
spiritual
state
which
had
caused
all
this
mass
of
building
to
be
made
they
could
not
tell
me
lv
the
sinologue
he
is
a
tall
man
rather
stout
flabby
as
though
he
does
not
take
enough
exercise
with
a
red
broad
face
and
grey
hair
he
talks
very
quickly
in
a
nervous
manner
with
a
voice
not
quite
big
enough
for
his
body
he
lives
in
a
temple
just
outside
the
city
gate
inhabiting
the
guest
chambers
and
three
buddhist
priests
with
a
tiny
acolyte
tend
the
temple
and
conduct
the
rites
there
is
a
little
chinese
furniture
in
the
rooms
and
a
vast
number
of
books
but
no
comfort
it
is
cold
and
the
study
in
which
we
sit
is
insufficiently
warmed
by
a
petroleum
stove
he
knows
more
chinese
than
any
man
in
china
he
has
been
working
for
ten
years
on
a
dictionary
which
will
supersede
that
of
a
noted
scholar
whom
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
he
has
personally
disliked
he
is
thus
benefiting
sinological
studies
and
satisfying
a
private
grudge
he
has
all
the
manner
of
a
don
and
you
feel
that
eventually
he
will
be
professor
of
chinese
at
the
university
of
oxford
and
then
at
last
exactly
in
his
place
he
is
a
man
of
wider
culture
than
most
sinologues
who
may
know
chinese
and
this
you
must
take
on
trust
but
who
it
is
lamentably
obvious
know
nothing
else
and
his
conversation
upon
chinese
thought
and
literature
has
in
consequence
a
fullness
and
a
variety
which
you
do
not
often
find
among
students
of
the
language
because
he
has
immersed
himself
in
his
particular
pursuits
and
has
cared
nothing
for
racing
and
shooting
the
europeans
think
him
queer
they
look
upon
him
with
the
suspicion
and
awe
with
which
human
beings
always
regard
those
who
do
not
share
their
tastes
they
suggest
that
he
is
not
quite
sane
and
some
accuse
him
of
smoking
opium
it
is
the
charge
which
is
always
brought
against
the
white
man
who
has
sought
to
familiarise
himself
with
the
civilisation
in
which
he
is
to
pass
the
greater
part
of
his
career
you
have
only
to
spend
a
little
while
in
that
apartment
bare
of
the
most
common
luxury
to
know
that
this
is
a
man
who
leads
a
life
wholly
of
the
spirit
but
it
is
a
specialised
life
art
and
beauty
seem
not
to
touch
him
and
as
i
listen
to
him
talk
so
sympathetically
of
the
chinese
poets
i
can
not
help
asking
myself
if
the
best
things
have
not
after
all
slipped
through
his
fingers
here
is
a
man
who
has
touched
reality
only
through
the
printed
page
the
tragic
splendour
of
the
lotus
moves
him
only
when
its
loveliness
is
enshrined
in
the
verse
of
li
po
and
the
laughter
of
demure
chinese
girls
stirs
his
blood
but
in
the
perfection
of
an
exquisitely
chiselled
quatrain
lvi
the
his
bearers
set
down
his
chair
in
the
yamen
and
unfastened
the
apron
which
protected
him
from
the
pouring
rain
he
put
out
his
head
like
a
bird
looking
out
of
its
nest
and
then
his
long
thin
body
and
finally
his
thin
long
legs
he
stood
for
a
moment
as
if
he
did
not
quite
know
what
to
do
with
himself
he
was
a
very
young
man
and
his
long
limbs
with
their
ungainliness
somehow
added
to
the
callowness
of
his
air
his
round
face
his
head
looked
too
small
for
the
length
of
his
body
with
its
fresh
complexion
was
quite
boyish
and
his
pleasant
brown
eyes
were
ingenuous
and
candid
the
sense
of
importance
which
his
official
position
gave
him
it
was
not
long
since
he
had
been
no
more
than
a
struggled
with
his
native
shyness
he
gave
his
card
to
the
judge
secretary
and
was
led
by
him
into
an
inner
court
and
asked
to
sit
down
it
was
cold
and
draughty
and
the
was
glad
of
his
heavy
waterproof
a
ragged
attendant
brought
tea
and
cigarettes
the
secretary
an
emaciated
youth
in
a
very
shabby
black
gown
had
been
a
student
at
harvard
and
was
glad
to
show
off
his
fluent
english
then
the
judge
came
in
and
the
stood
up
the
judge
was
a
portly
gentleman
in
heavily
wadded
clothes
with
a
large
smiling
face
and
spectacles
they
sat
down
and
sipped
their
tea
and
smoked
american
cigarettes
they
chatted
affably
the
judge
spoke
no
english
but
the
chinese
was
fresh
in
his
mind
and
he
could
not
help
thinking
that
he
acquitted
himself
creditably
presently
an
attendant
appeared
and
said
a
few
words
to
the
judge
and
the
judge
very
courteously
asked
the
if
he
was
ready
for
the
business
which
had
brought
him
the
door
into
the
outer
court
was
thrown
open
and
the
judge
walking
through
took
his
place
on
a
large
seat
at
a
table
that
stood
at
the
top
of
the
steps
he
did
not
smile
now
he
had
assumed
instinctively
the
gravity
proper
to
his
office
and
in
his
walk
notwithstanding
his
obesity
there
was
an
impressive
dignity
the
obeying
a
polite
gesture
took
a
seat
by
his
side
the
secretary
stood
at
the
end
of
the
table
then
the
outer
gateway
was
flung
wide
it
seemed
to
the
that
there
was
nothing
so
dramatic
as
the
opening
of
a
door
and
quickly
with
an
odd
sort
of
flurry
the
criminal
walked
in
he
walked
to
the
centre
of
the
courtyard
and
stood
still
facing
his
judge
on
each
side
of
him
walked
a
soldier
in
khaki
he
was
a
young
man
and
the
thought
that
he
could
be
no
older
than
himself
he
wore
only
a
pair
of
cotton
trousers
and
a
cotton
singlet
they
were
faded
but
clean
he
was
and
he
looked
no
different
from
any
of
the
thousands
of
coolies
in
their
monotonous
blue
that
you
passed
every
day
in
the
crowded
streets
of
the
city
the
judge
and
the
criminal
faced
one
another
in
silence
the
looked
at
the
face
but
then
he
looked
down
quickly
he
did
not
want
to
see
what
was
there
to
be
seen
so
plainly
he
felt
suddenly
embarrassed
and
looking
down
he
noticed
how
small
the
man
feet
were
shapely
and
slender
his
hands
were
tied
behind
his
back
he
was
slightly
built
of
the
middle
height
a
lissome
creature
that
suggested
the
wild
animal
and
standing
on
those
beautiful
feet
of
his
there
was
in
his
carriage
a
peculiar
grace
but
the
eyes
were
drawn
back
unwillingly
to
the
oval
smooth
and
unlined
face
it
was
livid
the
had
often
read
of
faces
that
were
green
with
terror
and
he
had
thought
it
but
a
fanciful
expression
and
here
he
saw
it
it
startled
him
it
made
him
feel
ashamed
and
in
the
eyes
too
eyes
that
did
not
slant
as
the
chinese
eye
is
wrongly
supposed
always
to
do
but
were
straight
in
the
eyes
that
seemed
unnaturally
large
and
bright
fixed
on
those
of
the
judge
was
a
terror
that
was
horrible
to
see
but
when
the
judge
put
him
a
question
trial
and
sentence
were
over
and
he
had
been
brought
there
that
morning
only
for
purposes
of
identification
he
answered
in
a
loud
plain
voice
boldly
however
his
body
might
betray
him
he
was
still
master
of
his
will
the
judge
gave
a
brief
order
and
flanked
by
his
two
soldiers
the
man
marched
out
the
judge
and
the
rose
and
walked
to
the
gateway
where
their
chairs
awaited
them
here
stood
the
criminal
with
his
guard
notwithstanding
his
tied
hands
he
smoked
a
cigarette
a
squad
of
little
soldiers
had
been
sheltering
themselves
under
the
overhanging
roof
and
on
the
appearance
of
the
judge
the
officer
in
charge
made
them
form
up
the
judge
and
the
settled
themselves
in
their
chairs
the
officer
gave
an
order
and
the
squad
stepped
out
a
couple
of
yards
behind
them
walked
the
criminal
then
came
the
judge
in
his
chair
and
finally
the
they
went
quickly
through
the
busy
streets
and
the
shopkeepers
gave
the
procession
an
incurious
stare
the
wind
was
cold
and
the
rain
fell
steadily
the
criminal
in
his
cotton
singlet
must
have
been
wet
through
he
walked
with
a
firm
step
his
head
held
high
jauntily
almost
it
was
some
distance
from
the
judge
yamen
to
the
city
wall
and
to
cover
it
took
them
nearly
half
an
hour
then
they
came
to
the
city
gate
and
went
through
it
four
men
in
ragged
blue
they
looked
like
peasants
were
standing
against
the
wall
by
the
side
of
a
poor
coffin
rough
hewn
and
unpainted
the
criminal
gave
it
a
glance
as
he
passed
by
the
judge
and
the
dismounted
from
their
chairs
and
the
officer
halted
his
soldiers
the
rice
fields
began
at
the
city
wall
the
criminal
was
led
to
a
pathway
between
two
patches
and
told
to
kneel
down
but
the
officer
did
not
think
the
spot
suitable
he
told
the
man
to
rise
he
walked
a
yard
or
two
and
knelt
down
again
a
soldier
was
detached
from
the
squad
and
took
up
his
position
behind
the
prisoner
three
feet
from
him
perhaps
he
raised
his
gun
the
officer
gave
the
word
of
command
he
fired
the
criminal
fell
forward
and
he
moved
a
little
convulsively
the
officer
went
up
to
him
and
seeing
that
he
was
not
quite
dead
emptied
two
barrels
of
his
revolver
into
the
body
then
he
formed
up
his
soldiers
once
more
the
judge
gave
the
a
smile
but
it
was
a
grimace
rather
than
a
smile
it
distorted
painfully
that
fat
face
they
stepped
into
their
chairs
but
at
the
city
gate
their
ways
parted
the
judge
bowed
the
a
courteous
farewell
the
was
carried
back
towards
the
consulate
through
the
streets
crowded
and
tortuous
where
life
was
going
on
just
as
usual
and
as
he
went
along
quickly
for
the
consular
bearers
were
fine
fellows
his
mind
distracted
a
little
by
their
constant
shouts
to
make
way
he
thought
how
terrible
it
was
to
make
an
end
of
life
deliberately
it
seemed
an
immense
responsibility
to
destroy
what
was
the
result
of
innumerable
generations
the
human
race
has
existed
so
long
and
each
one
of
us
is
here
as
the
result
of
an
infinite
series
of
miraculous
events
but
at
the
same
time
puzzling
him
he
had
a
sense
of
the
triviality
of
life
one
more
or
less
mattered
so
little
but
just
as
he
reached
the
consulate
he
looked
at
his
watch
he
had
no
idea
it
was
so
late
and
he
told
the
bearers
to
take
him
to
the
club
it
was
time
for
a
cocktail
and
by
heaven
he
could
do
with
one
a
dozen
men
were
standing
at
the
bar
when
he
went
in
they
knew
on
what
errand
he
had
been
that
morning
well
they
said
did
you
see
the
blighter
shot
you
bet
i
did
he
said
in
a
loud
and
casual
voice
everything
go
off
all
right
he
wriggled
a
bit
he
turned
to
the
bartender
same
as
usual
john
lvii
a
city
built
on
a
rock
they
say
of
it
that
the
dogs
bark
when
peradventure
the
sun
shines
there
it
is
a
grey
and
gloomy
city
shrouded
in
mist
for
it
stands
upon
its
rock
where
two
great
rivers
meet
so
that
it
is
washed
on
all
sides
but
one
by
turbid
rushing
waters
the
rock
is
like
the
prow
of
an
ancient
galley
and
seems
as
though
possessed
of
a
strange
unnatural
life
all
tremulous
with
effort
it
is
as
if
it
were
ever
on
the
point
of
forging
into
the
tumultuous
stream
rugged
mountains
hem
the
city
round
about
outside
the
walls
bedraggled
houses
are
built
on
piles
and
here
when
the
river
is
low
a
hazardous
population
lives
on
the
needs
of
the
watermen
for
at
the
foot
of
the
rock
a
thousand
junks
are
moored
wedged
in
with
one
another
tightly
and
men
lives
there
have
all
the
turbulence
of
the
river
a
steep
and
tortuous
stairway
leads
to
the
great
gate
guarded
by
a
temple
and
up
and
down
this
all
day
long
go
the
water
coolies
with
their
dripping
buckets
and
from
their
splashing
the
stair
and
the
street
that
leads
from
the
gate
are
wet
as
though
after
heavy
rain
it
is
difficult
to
walk
on
the
level
for
more
than
a
few
minutes
and
there
are
as
many
steps
as
in
the
hill
towns
of
the
italian
riviera
because
there
is
so
little
space
the
streets
are
pressed
together
narrow
and
dark
and
they
wind
continuously
so
that
to
find
your
way
is
like
finding
it
in
a
labyrinth
the
throng
is
as
thick
as
the
throng
on
a
pavement
in
london
when
a
theatre
is
emptying
itself
of
its
audience
you
have
to
push
your
way
through
it
stepping
aside
every
moment
as
chairs
come
by
and
coolies
bearing
their
everlasting
loads
itinerant
sellers
selling
almost
anything
that
anyone
can
want
to
buy
jostle
you
as
you
pass
the
shops
are
wide
open
to
the
street
without
windows
or
doors
and
they
are
crowded
too
they
are
like
an
exhibition
of
arts
and
crafts
and
you
may
see
what
a
street
looked
like
in
medieval
england
when
each
town
made
all
that
was
necessary
to
its
needs
the
various
industries
are
huddled
together
so
that
you
will
pass
through
a
street
of
butchers
where
carcasses
and
entrails
hang
bloody
on
each
side
of
you
with
flies
buzzing
about
them
and
mangy
dogs
prowling
hungrily
below
you
will
pass
through
a
street
where
in
each
house
there
is
a
and
they
are
busily
weaving
cloth
or
silk
there
are
innumerable
eating
houses
from
which
come
heavy
odours
and
here
at
all
hours
people
are
eating
then
generally
at
a
corner
you
will
see
and
here
all
day
long
again
the
tables
are
packed
with
men
of
all
sorts
drinking
tea
and
smoking
the
barbers
ply
their
trade
in
the
public
view
and
you
will
see
men
leaning
patiently
on
their
crossed
arms
while
their
heads
are
being
shaved
others
are
having
their
ears
cleaned
and
some
a
revolting
spectacle
the
inside
of
their
eyelids
scraped
it
is
a
city
of
a
thousand
noises
there
are
the
peddlers
who
announce
their
presence
by
a
wooden
gong
the
clappers
of
the
blind
musician
or
of
the
masseuse
the
shrill
falsetto
of
a
man
singing
in
a
tavern
the
loud
beating
of
a
gong
from
a
house
where
a
wedding
or
a
funeral
is
being
celebrated
there
are
the
raucous
shouts
of
the
coolies
and
the
menacing
whines
of
the
beggars
caricatures
of
humanity
their
emaciated
limbs
barely
covered
by
filthy
tatters
and
revolting
with
disease
the
cracked
melancholy
of
the
bugler
who
incessantly
practises
a
call
he
can
never
get
and
then
like
a
bass
to
which
all
these
are
a
barbaric
melody
the
insistent
sound
of
conversation
of
people
laughing
quarrelling
joking
shouting
arguing
gossiping
it
is
a
ceaseless
din
it
is
extraordinary
at
first
then
confusing
exasperating
and
at
last
maddening
you
long
for
a
moment
utter
silence
it
seems
to
you
that
it
would
be
a
voluptuous
delight
and
then
combining
with
the
irksome
throng
and
the
din
that
exhausts
your
ears
is
a
stench
which
time
and
experience
enable
you
to
distinguish
into
a
thousand
separate
stenches
your
nostrils
grow
cunning
foul
odours
beat
upon
your
harassed
nerves
like
the
sound
of
uncouth
instruments
playing
a
horrible
symphony
you
can
not
tell
what
are
the
lives
of
these
thousands
who
surge
about
you
upon
your
own
people
sympathy
and
knowledge
give
you
a
hold
you
can
enter
into
their
lives
at
least
imaginatively
and
in
a
way
really
possess
them
by
the
effort
of
your
fancy
you
can
make
them
after
a
fashion
part
of
yourself
but
these
are
as
strange
to
you
as
you
are
strange
to
them
you
have
no
clue
to
their
mystery
for
their
likeness
to
yourself
in
so
much
does
not
help
you
it
serves
rather
to
emphasize
their
difference
someone
attracts
your
attention
a
pale
youth
with
great
horn
spectacles
and
a
book
under
his
arm
whose
studious
look
is
pleasant
or
an
old
man
wearing
a
hood
with
a
grey
sparse
beard
and
tired
eyes
he
looks
like
one
of
those
sages
that
the
chinese
artists
painted
in
a
rocky
landscape
or
under
modelled
in
porcelain
but
you
might
as
well
look
at
a
brick
wall
you
have
nothing
to
go
upon
you
do
not
know
the
first
thing
about
them
and
your
imagination
is
baffled
but
when
reaching
the
top
of
the
hill
you
come
once
more
to
the
crenellated
walls
that
surround
the
city
and
go
out
through
the
frowning
gate
you
come
to
the
graves
they
stretch
over
the
country
one
mile
two
miles
three
four
five
interminable
green
mounds
up
and
down
the
hills
with
grey
stones
to
which
the
people
once
a
year
come
to
offer
libation
and
to
tell
the
dead
how
fare
the
living
whom
they
left
behind
and
they
are
as
thickly
crowded
the
dead
as
are
the
living
in
the
city
and
they
seem
to
press
upon
the
living
as
though
they
would
force
them
into
the
turbid
swirling
river
there
is
something
menacing
about
those
serried
ranks
it
is
as
though
they
were
laying
siege
to
the
city
with
a
sullen
ruthlessness
biding
their
time
and
as
though
in
the
end
encroaching
irresistibly
as
fate
they
would
drive
those
seething
throngs
before
them
till
the
houses
and
the
streets
were
covered
by
them
and
the
green
mounds
came
down
to
the
water
gate
then
at
last
silence
silence
would
dwell
there
undisturbed
they
are
uncanny
those
green
graves
they
are
terrifying
they
seem
to
wait
lviii
a
libation
to
the
gods
she
was
an
old
woman
and
her
face
was
wizened
and
deeply
lined
in
her
grey
hair
three
long
silver
knives
formed
a
fantastic
headgear
her
dress
of
faded
blue
consisted
of
a
long
jacket
worn
and
patched
and
a
pair
of
trousers
that
reached
a
little
below
her
calves
her
feet
were
bare
but
on
one
ankle
she
wore
a
silver
bangle
it
was
plain
that
she
was
very
poor
she
was
not
stout
but
squarely
built
and
in
her
prime
she
must
have
done
without
effort
the
heavy
work
in
which
her
life
had
been
spent
she
walked
leisurely
with
the
sedate
tread
of
an
elderly
woman
and
she
carried
on
her
arm
a
basket
she
came
down
to
the
harbour
it
was
crowded
with
painted
junks
her
eyes
rested
for
a
moment
curiously
on
a
man
who
stood
on
a
narrow
bamboo
raft
fishing
with
cormorants
and
then
she
set
about
her
business
she
put
down
her
basket
on
the
stones
of
the
quay
at
the
water
edge
and
took
from
it
a
red
candle
this
she
lit
and
fixed
in
a
chink
of
the
stones
then
she
took
several
held
each
of
them
for
a
moment
in
the
flame
of
the
candle
and
set
them
up
around
it
she
took
three
tiny
bowls
and
filled
them
with
a
liquid
that
she
had
brought
with
her
in
a
bottle
and
placed
them
neatly
in
a
row
then
from
her
basket
she
took
rolls
of
paper
cash
and
paper
shoes
and
unravelled
them
so
that
they
should
burn
easily
she
made
a
little
bonfire
and
when
it
was
well
alight
she
took
the
three
bowls
and
poured
out
some
of
their
contents
before
the
smouldering
she
bowed
herself
three
times
and
muttered
certain
words
she
stirred
the
burning
paper
so
that
the
flames
burned
brightly
then
she
emptied
the
bowls
on
the
stones
and
again
bowed
three
times
no
one
took
the
smallest
notice
of
her
she
took
a
few
more
paper
cash
from
her
basket
and
flung
them
in
the
fire
then
without
further
ado
she
took
up
her
basket
and
with
the
same
leisurely
rather
heavy
tread
walked
away
the
gods
were
duly
propitiated
and
like
an
old
peasant
woman
in
france
who
has
satisfactorily
done
her
day
housekeeping
she
went
