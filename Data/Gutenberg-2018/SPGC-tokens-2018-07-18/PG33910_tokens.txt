the

i

katrine
said
gwethyn
in
her
most
impressive
manner
have
you
noticed
anything
peculiar
going
on
in
this
house
the
last
two
or
three
days
why
no
replied
katrine
abstractedly
taking
a
fresh
squeeze
of
cobalt
blue
and
mixing
it
carefully
with
the
rose
madder
and
the
yellow
ochre
already
on
her
palette
nothing
at
all
unusual
gwethyn
be
careful
you
nearly
sat
down
on
my
brigand
and
his
head
still
wet
peccavi
i
did
see
he
was
there
apologized
gwethyn
rescuing
the
canvas
in
question
and
placing
it
in
a
position
of
greater
safety
on
the
mantelpiece
considering
you
got
absolutely
every
single
chair
littered
with
books
paints
and
turpentine
bottles
there
really
does
seem
a
spot
left
to
sit
upon
she
continued
in
an
injured
tone
except
the
table
returned
katrine
hastily
moving
a
box
of
pastels
and
a
pile
of
loose
drawings
to
make
room
please
do
disturb
my
things
i
been
sorting
them
out
and
i
do
want
to
get
them
mixed
up
again
squat
here
if
you
tired
and
leave
the
bottles
alone
i
am
tired
i
nearly
dead
i
bicycled
all
the
way
to
lindley
park
and
back
with
mona
taylor
on
the
step
she
make
me
take
her
and
she
no
light
weight
the
young
jumbo
poor
martyr
would
you
like
a
drink
of
turpentine
to
revive
you
sorry
the
chocs
are
finished
do
mock
me
mona
a
decent
kid
but
she
really
was
the
limit
i
see
myself
at
jericho
before
i
let
her
climb
on
my
step
again
but
kattie
to
go
back
to
what
i
was
saying
before
you
interrupted
me
have
you
noticed
there
a
something
a
most
decided
something
in
the
wind
your
imagination
my
dear
child
is
one
of
your
brightest
talents
you
particularly
clever
at
noticing
what
is
there
and
you
as
blind
as
a
bat
ca
you
see
for
yourself
that
father
and
mother
have
got
some
secret
they
keeping
from
us
why
are
we
having
our
summer
dresses
made
in
april
why
are
all
our
underclothes
being
overhauled
and
counted
why
did
two
new
trunks
arrive
yesterday
with
and
painted
on
them
in
red
letters
why
did
father
just
begin
to
say
something
last
night
and
mother
shut
him
up
in
a
hurry
and
he
look
and
murmur
forgotten
they
do
know
yet
girl
alive
if
you
blind
i
not
something
exciting
on
foot
i
wild
to
find
out
what
why
mother
tell
us
it
too
bad
she
just
going
to
now
said
a
voice
from
the
door
and
a
small
little
lady
walked
in
laughing
you
sha
be
kept
in
the
dark
any
longer
poor
injured
creatures
i
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
at
last
mumsie
cried
both
girls
jumping
up
and
sweeping
away
the
books
and
painting
materials
that
encumbered
the
one
sit
here
you
darling
it
is
turpentiny
really
here
the
cushion
are
you
comfy
now
well
do
please
begin
and
tell
we
all
in
a
dither
to
know
brace
your
nerves
then
chicks
first
and
foremost
father
has
been
asked
in
a
hurry
to
go
out
to
the
scientific
conference
at
sydney
and
give
the
lectures
on
geology
in
place
of
professor
baillie
who
has
been
taken
ill
and
ca
keep
his
engagement
he
has
accepted
and
must
start
by
the
he
wants
me
to
go
with
him
we
shall
probably
be
away
for
three
months
and
leave
us
gwethyn
voice
was
reproachful
are
we
to
be
two
sort
of
half
orphans
for
three
whole
months
oh
mumsie
it
ca
be
helped
replied
marsden
stroking
the
brown
head
apologetically
what
a
mummie
baby
you
are
still
remember
it
a
great
honour
for
father
to
be
asked
to
take
the
geology
chair
at
the
conference
he
ever
so
pleased
about
it
and
of
course
i
must
go
too
because
the
girls
smiled
simultaneously
and
with
complete
understanding
if
you
were
there
to
remind
him
mumsie
daddie
forget
which
days
his
lectures
were
on
twinkled
katrine
yes
and
i
verily
believe
put
his
coat
on
inside
out
or
wear
two
hats
or
do
something
horrible
if
he
were
thinking
very
hard
of
the
pleistocene
period
he
be
utterly
lost
without
you
no
you
could
let
him
go
alone
it
not
to
be
thought
of
agreed
marsden
hastily
pack
kattie
and
me
inside
your
trunk
urged
gwethyn
beseeching
voice
i
like
to
see
australia
too
expensive
a
business
for
four
no
we
made
other
plans
for
you
get
up
baby
you
too
heavy
to
nurse
go
and
sit
somewhere
else
yes
on
the
table
if
you
like
well
father
and
i
have
talked
the
matter
thoroughly
over
and
we
decided
to
send
you
both
for
a
term
to
a
we
know
of
in
redlandshire
to
school
shrieked
katrine
but
mumsie
i
left
school
last
christmas
why
i
almost
turned
my
hair
up
i
ca
go
back
and
be
a
kid
again
it
quite
impossible
no
one
wants
you
to
do
that
i
have
made
special
arrangements
for
you
with
franklin
you
are
to
join
some
of
the
classes
and
spend
the
rest
of
your
time
studying
painting
franklin
sister
miss
aubrey
is
a
very
good
artist
and
will
take
you
out
sketching
that
a
cheering
prospect
you
wanted
so
much
to
have
lessons
in
landscape
not
so
bad
but
i
suffering
still
from
shock
returned
katrine
school
school
anyhow
you
like
to
put
it
and
when
i
thought
i
left
for
good
and
where
do
i
come
in
wailed
a
melancholy
voice
from
the
table
you
katrine
and
i
only
gwethyn
i
too
for
words
mumsie
you
betrayed
us
shamefully
i
did
think
it
of
you
or
daddie
either
do
please
change
your
minds
no
for
once
we
parents
laughed
marsden
i
wrote
last
night
and
arranged
definitely
and
finally
for
you
to
go
to
aireyholme
on
the
i
suppose
i
can
take
tony
with
me
asked
gwethyn
anxiously
quitting
her
seat
on
the
table
to
catch
up
a
small
pekinese
spaniel
and
press
a
kiss
on
his
snub
nose
he
break
his
little
heart
with
fretting
bless
him
if
i
left
him
behind
would
you
tootitums
i
afraid
that
impossible
we
must
board
tony
out
while
we
away
i
dare
say
wilson
at
the
market
gardens
would
look
after
him
or
mary
might
take
him
home
with
her
now
gwethyn
do
make
a
fuss
for
i
ca
help
it
i
doing
the
best
i
can
for
everybody
you
realize
what
a
business
it
is
to
start
for
australia
at
such
a
short
notice
and
have
to
shut
up
one
house
and
dispose
of
one
family
all
in
three
weeks
time
i
nearly
distracted
with
making
so
many
arrangements
poor
darling
little
mumsie
said
katrine
squatting
down
by
the
and
cuddling
her
mother
hand
you
be
glad
when
over
and
you
safe
on
board
ship
which
way
do
people
sail
for
australia
i
do
know
any
geography
we
go
through
the
suez
canal
oh
mumsie
hereward
interrupted
both
the
girls
eagerly
marsden
eyes
were
shining
i
not
counting
on
seeing
him
she
protested
it
wildly
improbable
he
get
leave
and
we
only
have
a
few
hours
i
believe
at
port
said
still
of
course
there
always
just
the
possibility
now
i
understand
why
you
so
keen
to
go
to
australia
said
gwethyn
you
darling
humbug
you
have
made
daddie
accept
a
lectureship
on
the
top
of
chimborazo
or
at
the
north
pole
if
there
were
a
chance
of
seeing
hereward
for
ten
seconds
on
the
way
confess
you
would
i
suppose
i
as
as
most
mothers
who
have
an
only
son
in
the
army
said
marsden
rising
from
her
one
keep
one
bairns
babies
for
ever
they
grow
up
only
too
fast
and
fly
from
the
nest
well
i
told
you
the
great
secret
so
i
leave
you
to
digest
it
at
your
leisure
chicks
aireyholme
is
a
delightful
school
i
sure
you
enjoy
being
there
perhaps
you
going
to
have
the
time
of
your
lives
left
alone
the
two
girls
were
not
slow
in
discussing
the
wonderful
news
the
room
where
they
were
sitting
was
a
large
attic
which
had
been
converted
into
a
studio
the
drab
walls
were
covered
with
sketches
in
oils
pencil
or
chalk
a
couple
of
easels
palettes
and
canvases
and
a
litter
of
small
articles
mediums
pastels
and
stumps
gave
a
very
artistic
general
effect
and
suggested
plenty
of
work
on
the
part
of
the
owners
both
the
sisters
were
fond
of
painting
and
katrine
at
any
rate
spent
much
of
her
spare
time
here
with
her
blue
eyes
regular
features
clear
pale
complexion
and
plentiful
hair
katrine
looked
artistic
to
her
she
was
just
seventeen
and
owing
to
her
extreme
predilection
for
painting
had
persuaded
her
parents
to
take
her
from
the
high
school
and
let
her
attend
the
school
of
art
where
she
could
devote
all
her
energies
to
her
pet
subject
on
the
strength
of
this
promotion
she
regarded
herself
as
almost
if
not
quite
grown
up
a
view
that
was
certainly
not
shared
by
her
mother
and
was
perhaps
a
determining
influence
in
marsden
decision
to
send
her
to
a
gwethyn
two
years
younger
was
a
bright
merry
jolly
independent
damsel
with
twinkling
hazel
eyes
and
ripply
brown
hair
a
pair
of
beguiling
dimples
at
the
corners
of
her
mouth
and
a
nose
which
as
tennyson
kindly
expresses
it
was
inclined
to
be
unromantic
gwethyn
did
not
care
a
toss
about
high
art
though
in
her
way
she
was
rather
clever
at
painting
and
inclined
to
follow
katrine
lead
she
liked
drawing
animals
or
niggers
or
copying
funny
pictures
from
comic
papers
and
sometimes
i
fear
she
was
guilty
of
caricaturing
the
mistresses
at
school
to
the
immense
edification
of
the
rest
of
the
form
while
katrine
painted
fairies
gwethyn
would
be
drawing
grinning
gargoyles
or
goblins
with
a
spirited
dash
about
the
lines
and
much
humour
in
the
expression
of
the
faces
sometimes
these
artistic
efforts
produced
at
inopportune
moments
in
school
got
her
into
trouble
but
wrath
from
had
little
permanent
effect
upon
gwethyn
her
irrepressible
spirits
bobbed
cheerily
up
again
when
the
scoldings
were
over
and
her
eyes
instead
of
being
filled
with
penitential
tears
would
be
twinkling
with
suppressed
fun
just
now
she
was
sitting
on
the
table
in
the
studio
hugging
tony
and
trying
to
adjust
her
mental
vision
to
the
new
prospect
which
opened
before
her
it
hard
luck
to
have
to
leave
the
when
i
really
a
chance
for
the
tennis
championship
she
mourned
i
suppose
they
play
tennis
at
this
new
school
i
hope
to
goodness
they
wo
be
very
prim
i
guess
i
wake
them
up
a
little
if
they
are
katrine
do
you
hear
i
going
to
have
high
jinks
somehow
jink
if
you
like
returned
katrine
dolefully
it
all
very
well
for
you
you
only
changing
schools
but
i
left
and
i
quite
made
up
my
mind
to
turn
up
my
hair
this
term
of
course
i
like
the
i
can
do
lots
of
things
for
the
sketching
club
while
i
away
but
it
certainly
a
venture
perhaps
an
adventure
it
be
a
surprise
packet
at
any
rate
laughed
gwethyn
we
know
the
place
or
the
people
we
going
to
meet
or
anything
at
all
about
it
kattie
i
felt
serious
a
minute
ago
but
the
sight
of
your
lugubrious
face
makes
me
cackle
i
want
to
sketch
you
for
a
gargoyle
a
melancholy
one
this
time
that
better
now
you
laughing
look
here
we
have
some
fun
out
of
this
business
somehow
i
going
to
enjoy
myself
and
if
you
do
play
up
and
follow
suit
you
no
sister
of
mine
a
fortnight
later
the
two
girls
were
waving
from
the
window
of
a
train
that
steamed
slowly
out
of
hartfield
station
even
gwethyn
looked
a
trifle
serious
as
a
railway
arch
hid
the
last
glimpse
of
mumsie
standing
on
the
platform
and
katrine
conveniently
got
something
in
her
eye
which
required
the
vigorous
application
of
her
they
cheered
up
however
when
the
city
was
passed
and
suburban
villas
began
to
give
place
to
fields
and
hawthorn
hedges
after
all
novelty
was
delightful
and
for
girls
three
months
of
country
life
even
at
school
held
out
attractions
it
was
a
four
hours
journey
to
carford
where
they
changed
the
express
was
late
and
somewhat
to
their
dismay
they
found
they
had
missed
the
local
train
and
would
have
to
wait
three
hours
for
the
next
as
it
was
only
eight
miles
to
heathwell
the
village
where
the
school
was
situated
they
decided
to
ride
there
on
their
bicycles
leaving
their
luggage
to
follow
by
rail
the
prospect
of
a
cycling
jaunt
seemed
far
pleasanter
than
waiting
at
an
uninteresting
junction
it
would
be
fun
to
explore
the
country
and
they
would
probably
arrive
at
school
earlier
by
carrying
out
this
plan
through
the
sweet
lanes
therefore
they
started
where
the
young
leaves
were
lovely
with
the
tender
green
of
late
april
and
the
banks
gay
with
celandine
stars
and
white
stitchwort
and
the
thrushes
and
blackbirds
were
chanting
rival
choruses
in
the
hedgerow
and
the
larks
were
rising
up
from
the
fields
with
their
little
brown
throats
bubbling
over
with
the
message
of
spring
on
and
on
mile
after
mile
of
softly
undulating
country
where
farms
lay
among
orchards
full
of
blossom
and
a
river
wandered
between
banks
of
osiers
and
pollard
willows
and
the
sleek
cattle
grazed
in
meadows
flowery
as
gardens
it
seemed
a
fitting
way
to
eden
but
the
girls
had
not
quite
anticipated
the
little
paradise
that
burst
upon
their
view
when
a
bend
of
the
road
brought
them
suddenly
into
the
heart
of
heathwell
surely
they
must
have
left
the
present
century
and
by
some
strange
jugglery
of
fate
have
turned
back
the
clock
and
found
themselves
transported
to
mediæval
times
the
broad
village
street
ran
from
the
old
market
hall
at
one
end
to
the
ancient
church
at
the
other
flanked
on
either
side
by
houses
so
quaint
in
design
and
so
picturesque
in
effect
that
they
might
have
stepped
from
a
painting
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
the
irregular
flights
of
steps
the
creepers
climbing
to
the
very
chimneys
the
latticed
windows
the
swinging
with
its
heraldic
dragon
all
combined
to
make
up
a
scene
which
was
typically
representative
of
merrie
england
are
we
awake
or
are
we
in
an
elizabethan
dream
asked
katrine
dismounting
from
her
bicycle
to
stand
and
survey
the
prospect
i
do
know
i
feel
as
if
i
were
on
the
stage
of
a
shakespearian
play
a
crowd
of
peasants
with
may
garlands
ought
to
come
running
out
of
that
archway
and
perform
a
morris
dance
then
the
principal
characters
should
walk
on
by
the
side
wings
it
too
fascinating
for
words
i
wonder
where
aireyholme
is
we
shall
have
to
ask
our
way
ought
one
to
say
good
knave
canst
inform
me
or
gentle
swain
i
have
need
of
thy
counsel
we
shall
start
with
a
reputation
for
lunacy
if
you
do
the
school
proved
to
be
not
very
far
away
from
the
village
aireyholme
as
it
was
aptly
called
was
a
large
comfortable
rather
house
that
stood
on
a
small
hill
overlooking
the
river
orchards
in
the
glory
of
their
spring
bloom
made
a
pink
background
for
the
white
chimneys
and
the
roof
a
smooth
tennis
lawn
with
four
courts
faced
the
front
and
in
a
field
adjoining
the
river
were
some
hockey
goals
not
so
utterly
benighted
commented
gwethyn
as
she
and
katrine
wheeled
their
bicycles
up
the
drive
there
more
room
for
games
here
than
we
had
at
the
i
glad
i
bought
that
new
racket
wonder
what
their
play
like
i
say
these
are
ripping
courts
to
judge
by
the
soft
thud
of
balls
behind
the
bushes
and
the
cries
that
registered
the
scoring
several
sets
of
tennis
were
in
progress
and
as
the
girls
turned
the
corner
of
the
shrubbery
and
came
out
on
to
the
carriage
sweep
before
the
front
door
they
had
an
excellent
view
of
the
lawn
their
sudden
appearance
however
stopped
the
games
the
players
had
evidently
been
expecting
them
and
running
up
greeted
them
in
characteristic
schoolgirl
fashion
hello
are
you
katrine
and
gwethyn
marsden
so
you
turned
up
at
last
did
you
miss
your
train
miss
spencer
was
in
an
awful
state
of
mind
when
you
were
at
the
station
she
went
to
meet
you
have
you
biked
all
the
way
from
carford
yes
and
we
tired
and
as
hungry
as
hunters
returned
katrine
our
luggage
is
coming
by
the
we
missed
the
so
we
thought
rather
ride
on
than
wait
where
can
we
put
our
bikes
i
show
you
said
a
tall
girl
who
seemed
to
assume
the
lead
at
least
jess
and
novie
can
put
them
away
for
you
now
and
i
take
you
straight
to
franklin
she
be
most
fearfully
relieved
to
see
you
she
gets
herself
into
such
stews
over
anybody
who
does
arrive
on
the
nail
i
viola
webster
i
introduce
the
others
afterwards
soon
get
to
know
us
all
i
expect
there
are
here
this
term
counting
yourselves
did
you
bring
rackets
oh
good
we
awfully
keen
on
tennis
so
are
you
dorrie
vernon
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
our
games
secretary
i
wonder
if
franklin
is
in
the
study
or
in
the
perhaps
you
better
wait
here
while
i
find
her
oh
there
she
is
after
all
coming
down
the
stairs
the
new
world
into
which
katrine
and
gwethyn
were
speedily
introduced
was
a
very
different
affair
from
the
high
school
which
they
had
previously
attended
the
smaller
number
of
pupils
and
the
fact
that
it
was
a
made
the
girls
on
far
more
intimate
terms
with
one
another
than
is
possible
in
a
large
franklin
the
principal
was
a
woman
of
strong
character
she
had
been
a
lecturer
at
college
before
her
marriage
and
after
her
husband
death
had
begun
her
work
at
aireyholme
in
order
to
find
some
outlet
for
her
energies
her
two
sons
were
both
at
the
front
one
in
the
territorials
and
the
other
as
a
naval
chaplain
her
only
daughter
ermengarde
had
lately
been
married
to
a
clergyman
tall
massive
perhaps
even
a
trifle
masculine
in
appearance
franklin
hid
a
really
kind
heart
under
a
rather
uncompromising
and
masterful
manner
she
was
a
clever
manager
an
admirable
housekeeper
and
ruled
her
little
kingdom
well
and
wisely
both
in
features
and
personality
she
resembled
an
ancient
roman
matron
and
among
the
girls
she
was
often
known
as
the
mother
of
the
gracchi
franklin
sister
miss
aubrey
who
lived
at
the
school
was
an
artist
of
considerable
talent
she
superintended
the
art
teaching
and
gave
the
rest
of
her
time
to
in
both
oil
and
water
colours
it
was
largely
the
fact
that
katrine
might
have
sketching
lessons
from
miss
aubrey
which
had
influenced
and
marsden
in
their
choice
of
aireyholme
the
art
department
was
a
very
important
feature
of
that
school
any
talent
shown
among
the
pupils
was
carefully
fostered
the
general
atmosphere
of
the
place
was
artistic
the
girls
were
familiar
with
reproductions
of
pictures
from
famous
galleries
they
took
in
art
and
they
revelled
in
illustrated
catalogues
of
the
salon
or
the
royal
academy
and
dabbled
in
many
mediums
oil
water
colour
pastel
crayon
and
tempera
the
big
studio
was
perhaps
the
pet
room
of
the
house
it
was
liberty
hall
where
anybody
might
pursue
her
favourite
project
and
though
some
of
the
attempts
were
certainly
rather
crude
they
were
all
helpful
in
training
eye
and
hand
to
work
together
of
the
other
mistresses
miss
spencer
was
bookish
and
miss
andrews
athletic
the
former
was
rather
cold
and
dignified
an
excellent
and
painstaking
though
not
very
inspiring
teacher
she
spoke
slowly
and
precisely
and
there
was
a
smack
of
college
about
her
a
scholastic
officialism
of
manner
that
raised
a
barrier
of
reserve
between
herself
and
her
pupils
difficult
to
cross
very
different
was
miss
andrews
whose
hearty
breezy
ways
were
more
those
of
a
monitress
than
of
a
mistress
she
laughed
and
joked
with
the
girls
almost
like
one
of
themselves
though
she
could
assert
her
authority
emphatically
when
she
wished
needless
to
say
she
was
highly
popular
and
although
she
had
only
been
a
year
at
aireyholme
she
was
already
regarded
as
an
indispensable
feature
of
the
establishment
into
this
busy
and
highly
organized
little
community
katrine
and
gwethyn
as
must
shake
themselves
down
chapter
ii
a
scrape
katrine
and
gwethyn
had
been
given
a
bedroom
over
the
porch
a
dear
little
room
with
roses
and
jasmine
clustering
round
the
windows
and
with
an
excellent
view
of
the
tennis
lawn
they
arranged
their
possessions
there
after
tea
and
when
their
photos
books
and
had
found
suitable
niches
the
place
began
to
have
quite
a
appearance
it
not
so
bad
considering
it
school
commented
gwethyn
i
believe
i
going
to
like
one
or
two
of
those
girls
i
do
know
whether
i
going
to
like
franklin
objected
katrine
she
inclined
to
boss
as
if
one
were
a
kid
i
hope
mother
made
her
quite
understand
that
i
past
seventeen
and
not
an
schoolgirl
you
younger
than
viola
webster
though
or
that
other
girl
her
name
dorrie
vernon
returned
gwethyn
what
have
you
got
there
oh
katrine
a
box
of
hairpins
now
you
promised
mumsie
you
turn
up
your
hair
i
was
only
just
going
to
try
it
sometimes
for
fun
when
a
girl
is
as
tall
as
i
am
it
ridiculous
to
see
her
with
a
plait
flapping
down
her
back
i
sure
i
look
older
than
either
viola
or
dorrie
most
people
would
take
me
for
eighteen
katrine
was
staring
anxiously
at
herself
in
the
glass
i
not
going
to
be
treated
here
like
a
junior
they
begin
it
oh
you
settle
them
all
right
i
dare
say
answered
gwethyn
abstractedly
she
was
calculating
the
capacities
of
the
top
drawer
and
moreover
she
was
accustomed
to
these
outbursts
on
the
part
of
her
sister
katrine
put
the
hairpins
not
on
the
but
in
a
handy
spot
of
her
drawer
where
she
could
easily
get
at
them
it
was
absurd
of
gwethyn
to
make
such
a
fuss
so
she
reflected
a
girl
of
only
fifteen
can
not
possibly
enter
into
the
feelings
of
one
who
is
nearly
grown
up
she
preserved
a
rather
distant
manner
at
supper
it
would
not
be
dignified
to
unbend
all
at
once
to
strangers
gwethyn
always
too
with
everybody
was
talking
to
her
next
neighbour
and
evidently
eliciting
much
information
an
unrestrained
chuckle
on
her
part
caused
franklin
to
cast
a
glance
of
surprise
at
that
particular
portion
of
the
table
by
bedtime
both
the
were
feeling
serious
they
would
not
for
the
world
have
confessed
to
but
katrine
observed
that
she
hoped
vessels
bound
for
australia
never
blundered
into
german
mines
and
gwethyn
said
she
had
seen
in
one
of
the
papers
that
there
was
an
outbreak
of
enteric
among
the
troops
in
egypt
and
she
wondered
if
it
were
in
hereward
regiment
neither
of
which
remarks
was
calculated
to
raise
their
spirits
the
beds
had
spring
mattresses
and
were
quite
as
comfortable
as
those
at
home
by
all
ordinary
natural
laws
the
girls
tired
with
their
journey
ought
to
have
slept
the
slumbers
of
the
just
immediately
their
heads
touched
their
pillows
instead
of
doing
anything
so
sensible
they
lay
talking
until
they
were
both
so
excited
and
so
thoroughly
wideawake
that
sleep
refused
to
be
wooed
hour
after
hour
they
tossed
and
turned
counting
imaginary
sheep
jumping
over
gates
repeating
pieces
of
poetry
and
trying
the
expedients
that
are
supposed
to
be
infallible
brain
lullers
but
all
with
no
effect
outside
owls
were
hooting
a
continual
dismal
concert
of
i
like
owls
from
a
natural
history
point
of
view
groaned
katrine
and
i
no
doubt
they
only
telling
one
another
about
fat
mice
and
sparrows
but
i
wish
they
be
quiet
and
not
talk
they
far
more
disturbing
than
trams
and
taxis
talk
of
the
peace
of
the
country
i
should
like
to
know
where
it
is
agreed
gwethyn
turning
her
pillow
for
the
fourteenth
time
there
a
cock
crowing
now
and
a
dog
barking
it
impossible
to
sleep
a
wink
declared
katrine
jumping
out
of
bed
in
desperation
and
drawing
aside
the
window
curtain
i
believe
getting
light
there
was
a
stirring
of
dawn
in
the
air
all
the
world
seemed
wrapped
in
a
transparent
grey
veil
just
thin
enough
for
objects
to
loom
dimly
through
the
dusk
she
could
see
the
heavy
outlines
of
the
trees
at
the
farther
side
of
the
lawn
a
thrush
was
already
giving
a
preliminary
note
and
sparrows
were
beginning
to
twitter
under
the
eaves
what
the
use
of
stopping
in
bed
when
one
ca
sleep
exclaimed
katrine
let
us
dress
find
our
machines
and
go
for
a
spin
what
go
out
now
why
not
people
are
supposed
to
get
up
early
in
the
country
all
right
if
you
game
i
am
the
two
girls
had
not
been
accustomed
to
much
discipline
at
home
and
their
notions
of
school
rules
were
rudimentary
the
idea
of
getting
up
so
early
and
going
out
to
explore
struck
them
both
as
delightfully
enterprising
and
adventurous
they
made
a
hurried
toilet
crept
cautiously
downstairs
and
found
the
passage
at
the
back
of
the
house
where
their
bicycles
had
been
temporarily
placed
the
night
before
it
was
an
easy
matter
to
unbolt
a
side
door
and
make
their
way
through
the
garden
and
down
the
drive
before
the
day
was
much
older
they
were
riding
along
the
quiet
dim
road
in
that
calm
silence
that
precedes
the
dawn
the
air
was
most
fresh
and
exhilarating
as
their
machines
sped
through
the
grey
morning
mist
they
felt
almost
as
if
they
were
on
aeroplanes
rushing
among
the
clouds
at
first
all
was
dark
and
vague
and
mysterious
but
every
minute
the
light
was
growing
stronger
and
presently
they
could
distinguish
the
gossamer
hung
like
a
tangled
magic
web
upon
the
hedges
in
dainty
shimmering
masses
as
if
the
pixies
had
been
spinning
and
weaving
in
the
night
and
had
not
yet
had
time
to
carry
off
the
result
of
their
labours
it
just
like
a
fairy
tale
said
gwethyn
do
you
remember
the
boy
who
sat
on
the
fox
tail
and
they
went
on
and
on
till
his
hair
whistled
in
the
wind
those
rabbits
ought
to
stop
and
talk
and
tell
us
about
brer
terrapin
and
the
tar
baby
i
sure
uncle
remus
is
squatting
at
the
foot
of
that
tree
we
shall
meet
the
presently
i
expect
what
a
baby
you
are
but
it
is
lovely
i
agree
with
you
oh
gwethyn
look
at
the
sky
over
there
that
a
fairy
tale
if
you
like
let
stop
and
watch
it
it
was
indeed
a
glorious
sight
the
colour
which
at
first
had
been
had
changed
to
transparent
opal
then
blushing
with
a
warmer
hue
grew
slowly
to
pink
amber
and
violet
great
streamers
of
rosy
orange
began
to
stretch
like
ethereal
fingers
upwards
from
the
horizon
the
fields
were
in
shadow
and
a
quiet
stillness
reigned
as
if
the
world
paused
waiting
in
hope
and
expectancy
for
that
fresh
and
ever
wonderful
vision
the
miracle
of
the
returning
dawn
then
the
great
shimmering
glowing
sun
lifted
himself
up
from
among
the
mists
in
the
meadows
gaining
in
brilliance
with
every
foot
he
ascended
till
the
light
burst
out
a
flood
of
brightness
and
all
the
landscape
was
radiant
at
that
mother
earth
seemed
to
bestir
herself
with
the
new
day
came
the
fresh
pulse
of
life
and
the
reawakening
of
myriads
of
nature
children
the
first
lark
went
soaring
into
the
overhead
the
chaffinches
began
to
tweet
in
the
elms
a
white
butterfly
fluttered
over
the
hedge
and
a
marvellous
busy
throng
of
insect
life
seemed
suddenly
astir
and
ahum
it
was
a
different
world
from
that
of
an
hour
before
a
living
breathing
working
rejoicing
world
the
shadows
and
the
mystery
had
fled
and
left
it
as
fair
as
if
just
created
it
was
worth
getting
up
for
this
said
katrine
i
never
seen
such
a
transformation
scene
in
my
life
i
wish
i
could
paint
it
but
what
colours
could
one
use
nothing
but
stained
glass
could
give
that
glowing
glorious
pinky
violet
i
have
the
least
idea
where
we
are
or
how
far
away
from
the
school
said
gwethyn
we
rode
along
quite
spec
and
we
may
have
come
two
miles
or
five
for
anything
i
know
yes
it
has
been
lovely
and
i
see
you
still
wrapt
in
a
sort
of
rapturous
dream
and
up
among
rosy
clouds
but
i
come
down
to
earth
and
i
most
unromantically
hungry
it
seems
years
since
we
had
supper
last
night
i
wonder
if
we
could
find
a
farm
and
buy
some
milk
rose
madder
mixed
with
violet
lake
and
a
touch
of
aureolin
and
italian
pink
might
do
it
murmured
katrine
no
it
would
they
want
current
coin
of
the
realm
have
you
any
pennies
left
in
your
coat
pocket
you
mundane
creature
i
was
talking
of
the
sunrise
and
not
of
mere
milk
yes
i
have
five
pennies
and
a
halfpenny
which
ought
to
buy
enough
to
take
a
bath
in
i
do
want
a
bath
only
a
glassful
but
it
a
case
of
catch
your
farm
i
do
see
the
very
ghost
of
a
chimney
anywhere
nothing
but
fields
and
trees
better
go
on
till
we
find
one
then
said
katrine
mounting
her
machine
again
they
rode
at
least
half
a
mile
without
passing
any
human
habitation
then
at
last
the
welcome
sight
of
a
gate
and
barns
greeted
them
it
looks
like
the
back
of
a
farm
decided
gwethyn
let
us
leave
our
bikes
here
and
explore
up
a
short
lane
and
across
a
they
penetrated
into
an
orchard
here
under
a
maze
of
pink
blossom
a
girl
of
perhaps
twelve
or
thirteen
with
a
carriage
whip
in
one
hand
and
a
bowl
in
the
other
was
throwing
grain
to
a
large
flock
of
poultry
ducks
geese
and
hens
that
were
collected
round
her
the
by
all
that
wonderful
i
told
you
it
was
a
morning
whispered
gwethyn
now
for
it
i
go
and
demand
milk
how
ought
one
to
greet
a
she
stepped
forward
but
at
that
moment
a
large
collie
dog
that
had
been
lying
unnoticed
at
the
foot
of
an
apple
tree
sprang
up
suddenly
and
faced
her
snarling
good
dog
poor
old
fellow
come
here
then
said
gwethyn
in
a
wheedling
voice
hoping
to
propitiate
it
for
she
was
fond
of
dogs
instead
of
being
pacified
by
her
blandishments
however
it
showed
its
teeth
savagely
and
darting
behind
her
seized
her
by
the
skirt
gwethyn
was
not
she
shrieked
as
if
she
were
being
murdered
help
help
yelled
katrine
distractedly
the
was
already
calling
off
the
dog
and
with
a
lash
of
her
long
whip
sent
him
howling
away
she
walked
leisurely
up
to
the
visitors
you
more
frightened
than
hurt
she
remarked
with
a
glance
at
gwethyn
what
do
you
want
here
we
came
to
ask
if
we
could
buy
some
milk
stammered
katrine
i
suppose
this
is
a
farm
no
it
is
a
farm
and
we
do
sell
milk
the
girl
tone
was
ungracious
her
appearance
also
was
the
reverse
of
attractive
her
sharp
features
and
sallow
complexion
had
an
unwholesome
look
her
hair
was
lank
and
lustreless
and
the
bright
dark
eyes
did
not
hold
a
pleasant
expression
she
wore
a
blue
gingham
overall
pinafore
that
hid
her
dress
where
are
you
from
and
what
are
you
doing
here
so
early
she
continued
gazing
curiously
at
katrine
and
gwethyn
we
bicycled
from
aireyholme
began
gwethyn
you
never
the
new
girls
oh
i
say
who
gave
you
leave
to
go
out
nobody
well
i
should
care
to
be
you
when
you
get
back
that
all
franklin
will
have
something
to
say
do
you
know
her
then
gasped
gwethyn
know
her
i
should
think
i
do
just
a
little
if
you
take
my
advice
you
ride
back
as
quick
as
you
can
i
must
go
and
feed
my
chickens
now
oh
you
will
catch
it
she
walked
away
chuckling
to
herself
as
if
she
rather
enjoyed
the
prospect
of
their
discomfiture
as
she
turned
into
the
garden
she
looked
round
and
laughed
outright
what
an
odious
girl
who
is
she
exclaimed
katrine
indignantly
she
never
apologized
for
her
hateful
dog
catching
hold
of
you
what
does
she
mean
by
laughing
at
us
i
should
like
to
teach
her
manners
perhaps
we
better
be
riding
back
said
gwethyn
uneasily
they
said
breakfast
was
at
eight
i
have
an
idea
what
the
time
is
i
wish
we
brought
our
watches
they
had
cycled
farther
than
they
imagined
and
in
retracing
their
road
they
took
a
wrong
turning
consequently
going
several
miles
out
of
their
way
they
were
beginning
to
be
rather
tired
by
the
time
they
reached
aireyholme
the
excitement
and
romance
of
the
spring
dawn
had
faded
life
seemed
quite
ordinary
and
prosaic
with
the
sun
high
in
the
heavens
perhaps
they
both
felt
a
little
doubtful
of
their
reception
though
neither
was
prepared
to
admit
it
as
they
wheeled
their
machines
past
the
lower
schoolroom
window
where
the
girls
were
at
early
morning
preparation
a
dozen
excited
heads
bobbed
up
to
look
at
them
they
took
the
bicycles
through
the
side
door
and
left
them
in
the
passage
in
the
hall
they
met
coralie
nelson
going
to
practice
with
a
pile
of
music
in
her
hand
hello
is
it
you
she
exclaimed
so
you
turned
up
again
after
all
there
been
a
pretty
hullabaloo
i
can
tell
you
were
you
trying
to
run
away
of
course
not
declared
katrine
airily
we
were
only
taking
a
little
run
on
our
bikes
before
breakfast
it
was
delicious
riding
so
early
was
it
indeed
well
you
are
the
limit
for
coolness
i
must
say
better
go
and
explain
to
franklin
she
in
the
study
and
particularly
anxious
to
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
hope
have
a
pleasant
interview
hope
we
shall
thanks
returned
katrine
bluffing
the
matter
off
as
well
as
she
could
i
ca
see
what
there
is
to
make
such
a
fuss
about
we
not
late
for
breakfast
i
suppose
oh
dear
me
no
you
in
excellent
time
coralie
tone
was
sarcastic
punctuality
is
considered
a
great
virtue
at
aireyholme
perhaps
you
may
be
congratulated
upon
it
i
wo
prophesy
on
the
whole
i
would
change
into
your
shoes
though
we
do
want
you
to
retorted
gwethyn
the
two
girls
tapped
at
the
study
door
and
entered
with
nonchalance
katrine
in
particular
was
determined
to
show
her
superiority
to
the
conventions
which
might
hedge
in
ordinary
pupils
a
girl
of
seventeen
who
had
left
school
last
christmas
must
not
allow
herself
to
be
treated
as
the
rest
of
the
rank
and
file
at
the
sight
of
the
principal
calm
determined
face
however
her
courage
began
to
slip
away
somehow
she
did
not
feel
quite
so
as
she
had
expected
franklin
had
not
kept
school
for
fifteen
years
for
nothing
her
keen
grey
eyes
could
quell
the
most
unruly
spirit
katrine
and
gwethyn
marsden
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
she
began
peremptorily
who
gave
you
leave
of
absence
before
breakfast
we
saw
no
reason
to
ask
replied
katrine
we
could
sleep
so
we
thought
we
get
up
early
and
take
a
spin
on
our
machines
please
to
understand
for
the
future
that
such
escapades
are
strictly
forbidden
there
are
certain
free
hours
during
the
day
and
there
are
definite
school
bounds
which
one
of
the
monitresses
will
explain
to
you
later
on
no
girl
is
allowed
to
exceed
these
limits
without
special
permission
illustration
goose
girl
by
all
that
wonderful
whispered
gwethyn
but
i
thought
mother
said
i
was
to
be
in
the
ordinary
school
urged
katrine
your
mother
has
placed
you
in
my
charge
frowned
franklin
and
my
decision
upon
every
question
must
be
final
while
you
are
at
aireyholme
you
will
follow
our
usual
rules
i
make
exceptions
for
nobody
do
let
me
have
to
remind
you
of
this
again
the
principal
manner
was
authoritative
her
large
presence
and
handsome
roman
features
seemed
to
give
extra
weight
to
her
words
she
was
evidently
not
accustomed
to
argue
with
her
pupils
katrine
with
those
steely
blue
eyes
fixed
upon
her
had
the
wisdom
to
desist
from
further
excuses
she
left
the
room
outwardly
submissive
though
inwardly
raging
at
seventeen
to
be
treated
like
a
kindergarten
infant
indeed
katrine
dignity
was
severely
wounded
i
do
believe
i
going
to
like
this
place
she
remarked
to
gwethyn
as
they
went
upstairs
the
rest
of
the
morning
until
seemed
a
confused
whirl
to
the
marsdens
last
night
they
had
been
let
alone
but
now
they
were
initiated
into
the
many
and
manifold
ways
of
the
school
they
were
placed
respectively
in
the
sixth
and
fifth
form
desks
and
lockers
were
apportioned
to
them
they
were
given
new
books
and
allotted
certain
times
for
practising
on
the
piano
at
the
interval
they
made
the
more
intimate
acquaintance
of
at
least
half
of
their
did
you
get
into
a
scrape
with
mother
franklin
asked
coralie
the
idea
of
your
going
gallivanting
off
on
your
own
this
morning
by
the
by
your
bikes
have
been
put
in
the
shed
with
the
others
it
locked
up
at
night
we
get
special
exeats
sometimes
to
go
long
rides
so
look
so
doleful
shall
i
tell
you
who
some
of
the
girls
are
you
know
viola
webster
our
captain
and
dorrie
vernon
our
tennis
champion
that
fair
one
talking
to
them
is
diana
bennett
they
our
monitresses
those
inseparables
are
jill
barton
and
ivy
parkins
the
one
with
two
is
rose
randall
and
those
kids
are
belgian
refugees
yvonne
and
mélanie
de
boeck
they
supposed
to
be
improving
our
french
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
talk
english
of
a
sort
most
of
the
time
that
laura
browne
playing
tennis
i
warn
you
that
she
sure
to
take
you
up
hotly
for
a
day
or
two
while
you
new
but
she
drop
you
again
afterwards
anyone
else
you
like
to
ask
about
i
act
school
directory
coralie
rattled
on
in
a
half
half
quizzical
fashion
giving
brief
biographical
sketches
of
her
companions
introducing
some
and
indicating
others
most
of
the
girls
were
collected
round
the
tennis
lawn
watching
the
sets
a
group
of
juniors
seated
on
a
bench
attracted
katrine
attention
standing
near
them
though
somewhat
apart
was
one
whose
thin
angular
figure
and
sharp
pale
face
seemed
familiar
even
without
the
blue
overall
pinafore
it
was
easy
enough
to
recognize
her
katrine
nudged
gwethyn
and
both
simultaneously
exclaimed
the
who
is
that
dreadful
child
asked
katrine
we
met
her
while
we
were
out
this
morning
and
she
was
civil
her
face
is
just
the
colour
of
a
fungus
coralie
laughed
oh
that
githa
hamilton
she
not
exactly
celebrated
for
her
sweet
temper
so
i
should
imagine
what
was
she
doing
out
of
bounds
before
seven
she
not
a
boarder
she
lives
with
an
uncle
and
aunt
and
comes
to
school
on
her
bicycle
she
the
only
we
have
i
hate
to
be
a
you
out
of
everything
i
should
think
such
an
extraordinary
little
toadstool
would
be
in
anything
even
if
she
were
a
boarder
commented
gwethyn
who
had
not
forgiven
the
savage
assault
of
the
collie
and
the
contemptuous
more
frightened
than
hurt
of
its
mistress
you
about
right
there
githa
no
particular
favourite
even
in
her
own
form
if
i
straight
lank
hair
like
that
i
friz
it
every
night
declared
gwethyn
emphatically
she
the
plainest
girl
in
the
school
that
my
opinion
of
her
chapter
iii
shaking
down
if
katrine
and
gwethyn
had
taken
a
dislike
to
the
toadstool
as
they
nicknamed
githa
hamilton
that
elfish
damsel
seemed
ready
to
return
the
sentiment
with
interest
she
divined
their
weak
points
with
horrible
intuition
and
her
sharp
little
tongue
was
always
armed
with
caustic
remarks
she
would
stand
watching
them
like
a
malign
imp
when
they
played
tennis
sneering
if
they
made
bad
strokes
and
rejoicing
over
their
opponents
scores
with
ostentatious
triumph
at
katrine
airs
of
dignity
she
scoffed
openly
and
she
would
call
in
question
really
quite
harmless
little
exaggerations
with
ruthless
punctiliousness
the
tried
to
preserve
an
airy
calm
and
treat
this
offensive
junior
as
beneath
their
notice
but
she
was
a
determined
enemy
returning
constantly
to
the
assault
and
the
skirmishes
continued
a
complete
contrast
to
githa
spirit
of
opposition
was
the
behaviour
of
laura
browne
as
coralie
had
predicted
she
took
up
the
new
girls
hotly
she
walked
with
them
or
sat
next
to
them
on
every
possible
occasion
asked
for
their
autographs
obtained
snapshots
of
them
with
her
brownie
camera
and
gushed
over
their
home
photos
and
private
possessions
it
so
nice
to
have
someone
at
the
school
with
whom
i
really
feel
i
can
become
friends
she
assured
gwethyn
the
moment
i
saw
you
both
i
fell
in
love
with
you
i
believe
strongly
in
first
impressions
you
something
seems
to
tell
me
there
to
be
a
link
between
our
lives
how
romantic
to
have
a
brother
at
the
front
i
think
his
portrait
in
uniform
is
simply
perfect
i
shall
ask
you
to
lend
it
to
me
sometimes
when
you
can
spare
it
it
does
one
good
to
look
at
a
hero
like
that
i
wish
my
brothers
were
old
enough
to
join
they
at
the
mischievous
age
at
present
i
envy
you
your
luck
and
laura
sighed
dramatically
katrine
mindful
of
coralie
hint
received
these
advances
with
caution
but
gwethyn
who
was
not
a
very
discriminating
little
person
felt
rather
flattered
after
all
it
is
highly
pleasant
to
be
openly
admired
your
friendship
courted
your
wishes
consulted
and
your
opinions
treated
with
deference
in
the
first
flush
of
her
enthusiasm
she
readily
drew
a
sketch
in
laura
album
embroidered
a
handkerchief
for
her
and
proffered
peppermint
creams
as
long
as
the
box
lasted
she
submitted
peaceably
to
lend
penknife
scissors
pencils
or
any
other
unconsidered
trifles
and
when
she
was
obliged
to
ask
for
them
back
her
new
friend
was
so
ready
with
apologies
for
their
that
she
felt
almost
ashamed
of
having
mentioned
the
matter
between
githa
evident
dislike
and
laura
fawning
sycophancy
was
a
wide
gap
these
two
had
openly
declared
themselves
for
or
against
the
solid
block
of
the
school
stood
aloof
during
their
first
week
at
least
the
new
girls
must
be
on
approval
before
they
settled
into
the
places
which
they
would
eventually
occupy
their
sayings
and
doings
were
closely
noted
but
public
opinion
reserved
itself
the
monitresses
were
kind
but
slightly
cool
they
did
not
altogether
like
attitude
she
had
given
them
to
understand
that
she
had
come
to
aireyholme
as
an
art
student
and
not
as
a
pupil
and
they
resented
the
assumption
of
superiority
implied
we
all
art
students
here
diana
bennett
had
replied
stiffly
but
you
not
taking
special
private
lessons
from
miss
aubrey
asked
katrine
feeling
that
she
scored
by
this
point
viola
and
dorrie
and
i
are
going
in
for
the
so
we
have
much
time
for
painting
it
a
jolly
grind
getting
up
all
our
subjects
i
can
tell
you
in
the
privacy
of
their
own
study
the
three
monitresses
discussed
the
matter
at
some
length
i
rather
like
them
both
said
dorrie
katrine
quite
an
interesting
sort
of
girl
only
she
has
at
present
far
too
high
an
idea
of
her
own
importance
she
inclined
to
be
a
little
patronizing
commented
viola
of
course
that
wo
do
i
captain
here
and
she
have
quite
to
realize
that
we
ca
let
a
girl
come
into
the
school
at
seventeen
and
begin
to
boss
the
whole
show
rather
not
there
ought
to
be
a
rule
to
admit
no
one
over
fifteen
thirteen
would
be
better
well
at
any
rate
when
they
juniors
and
have
time
to
get
used
to
aireyholme
ways
i
been
here
six
years
and
if
anyone
knows
the
school
traditions
i
ought
to
no
miss
katrine
marsden
must
be
allowed
to
give
herself
airs
that
i
quite
made
up
my
mind
about
what
do
you
think
of
gwethyn
she
a
but
i
like
her
the
better
of
the
two
she
inseparables
with
laura
browne
well
you
know
laura
she
goes
for
every
new
girl
and
toadies
till
she
got
all
she
can
or
grows
tired
of
it
gwethyn
will
find
her
out
in
course
of
time
i
suppose
the
real
gist
of
the
matter
said
dorrie
wrinkling
her
brows
anxiously
is
whether
i
to
put
them
in
the
tennis
list
they
play
uncommonly
well
oh
it
would
be
fair
to
let
new
girls
represent
the
school
you
think
so
on
the
other
hand
the
school
must
win
by
hook
or
by
crook
well
i
do
think
it
would
do
to
make
either
of
them
a
champion
putting
them
above
the
heads
of
those
who
have
been
here
for
years
it
a
difficult
question
certainly
difficult
not
at
all
i
think
it
conclusive
snapped
viola
rather
sharply
those
who
are
trained
in
aireyholme
methods
are
best
fitted
to
represent
aireyholme
there
ca
be
two
opinions
about
it
there
was
certainly
some
occasion
for
the
rather
jealous
attitude
which
the
monitresses
were
inclined
to
adopt
towards
katrine
by
the
arrangement
which
her
mother
had
made
with
franklin
she
was
really
more
in
the
position
of
the
parlour
boarder
than
of
an
ordinary
pupil
she
had
been
placed
in
the
sixth
form
but
took
less
than
half
the
classes
the
rest
of
her
time
being
devoted
to
art
lessons
while
others
were
drudging
away
at
latin
translation
or
racking
their
brains
over
mathematical
problems
she
was
seated
in
the
studio
blissfully
painting
flowers
or
greater
luck
still
sallying
forth
with
and
easel
to
sketch
from
nature
as
the
studio
was
the
favourite
haunt
of
most
of
the
seniors
these
special
privileges
were
the
envy
of
the
school
nan
bethell
and
gladwin
riley
in
particular
hitherto
the
aireyholme
art
stars
felt
their
noses
much
put
out
of
joint
and
were
injured
that
their
mothers
had
not
made
a
like
arrangement
on
their
behalf
they
went
so
far
as
to
petition
franklin
for
a
similar
exemption
from
certain
lessons
in
favour
of
painting
but
the
principal
was
adamant
the
sixth
was
her
own
particular
form
she
was
jealous
of
its
reputation
and
by
no
means
disposed
to
excuse
members
whom
she
had
been
coaching
for
months
the
credit
which
they
ought
to
gain
for
the
school
in
the
examination
lists
though
art
was
a
pet
hobby
at
aireyholme
it
must
not
be
allowed
to
usurp
the
chief
place
to
the
detriment
of
franklin
own
subjects
in
the
meantime
katrine
quite
unaware
of
these
difficulties
wore
her
picturesque
painting
apron
for
several
hours
daily
and
revelled
both
in
her
work
and
in
the
companionship
of
her
new
teacher
miss
aubrey
was
the
greatest
possible
contrast
to
her
sister
franklin
instead
of
being
tall
imposing
and
masterful
she
was
small
slight
and
gentle
in
manner
a
ducky
little
thing
most
of
the
girls
called
her
and
katrine
endorsed
the
general
opinion
miss
aubrey
certainly
would
not
have
made
a
good
head
of
the
establishment
she
was
dreamy
and
made
no
attempt
to
uphold
discipline
but
in
her
own
department
she
was
delightful
the
pupils
talked
with
impunity
in
her
classes
but
they
nevertheless
worked
with
an
enthusiasm
that
many
a
stricter
teacher
might
have
failed
to
inspire
there
was
an
artistic
atmosphere
about
miss
aubrey
she
always
seemed
slightly
in
the
clouds
as
if
she
were
busier
observing
the
general
picturesque
effect
of
life
than
its
particular
details
in
appearance
she
was
pleasing
with
soft
grey
eyes
and
smooth
brown
hair
it
was
the
fashion
at
the
school
to
call
her
pretty
the
girls
set
her
down
as
many
years
younger
than
franklin
the
studio
was
of
course
her
special
domain
at
aireyholme
she
worked
much
there
herself
and
quite
a
collection
of
her
pictures
adorned
the
walls
the
crisp
bold
style
of
painting
aroused
admiration
and
made
her
long
to
try
her
skill
at
miss
aubrey
had
kept
her
at
a
study
of
flowers
until
she
could
judge
her
capabilities
but
at
the
end
of
the
first
week
the
mistress
declared
her
ready
for
more
advanced
work
i
am
going
into
the
village
this
morning
to
finish
a
picture
of
my
own
she
announced
you
and
your
sister
may
come
with
me
and
i
will
start
you
both
at
a
pretty
little
subject
gwethyn
whose
had
been
left
to
the
entire
discretion
of
franklin
was
highly
elated
to
find
that
she
was
to
share
some
of
katrine
art
privileges
she
had
never
expected
such
luck
and
rejoiced
accordingly
the
fact
was
that
miss
aubrey
wished
to
continue
her
own
sketch
and
to
settle
katrine
at
an
easier
subject
a
hundred
yards
farther
down
the
street
she
thought
it
might
be
unpleasant
for
the
girl
to
sit
alone
and
that
the
sisters
would
be
company
for
each
other
she
would
be
near
enough
to
keep
an
eye
on
them
and
to
come
and
correct
their
drawings
from
time
to
time
much
encumbered
therefore
with
easels
boards
and
other
impedimenta
but
feeling
almost
equal
to
artists
the
marsdens
to
the
wild
envy
of
their
less
fortunate
sallied
forth
with
miss
aubrey
down
to
the
village
their
teacher
had
chosen
a
very
picturesque
little
bit
for
their
first
attempt
a
charming
cottage
with
an
uneven
roof
and
an
irregular
chimney
she
superintended
them
while
they
opened
their
and
fixed
their
easels
then
showed
them
where
the
principal
lines
in
their
sketches
ought
to
be
placed
you
must
mind
if
people
come
and
stare
at
you
a
little
she
remarked
cheerfully
it
what
all
artists
have
to
put
up
with
get
used
to
it
now
i
going
to
my
own
subject
i
shall
come
back
very
soon
to
see
how
you
getting
on
with
great
satisfaction
the
girls
began
blocking
in
their
cottage
feeling
almost
like
professional
artists
as
they
marked
roof
angles
and
points
of
perspective
with
the
aid
of
a
what
a
lovely
little
village
it
is
exulted
katrine
and
so
delightfully
peaceful
and
quiet
there
nobody
about
yes
it
heavenly
one
could
sit
out
sketching
in
the
street
at
home
agreed
gwethyn
enthusiastically
alas
their
bliss
was
shortlived
they
had
scarcely
been
five
minutes
at
work
when
they
were
espied
by
half
a
dozen
children
who
ran
up
promptly
and
joyfully
to
stare
at
their
proceedings
the
group
of
spectators
seemed
to
consider
them
an
attraction
for
they
rushed
off
to
spread
the
gleeful
news
among
their
fellows
with
the
result
that
in
a
few
moments
half
the
youth
of
the
neighbourhood
were
swarming
round
katrine
and
gwethyn
like
flies
round
a
evidently
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
regarded
artists
as
a
free
show
not
only
did
the
small
fry
flock
round
the
girls
easels
but
a
certain
proportion
of
who
apparently
had
nothing
better
to
do
strolled
up
and
made
an
outside
ring
to
the
increasing
and
interested
audience
do
they
imagine
we
the
vanguard
of
a
circus
or
that
it
an
ingenious
form
of
advertisement
whispered
gwethyn
i
believe
they
expect
me
to
write
menagerie
is
coming
in
big
letters
on
my
or
perhaps
purple
pills
i
should
feel
more
inclined
to
write
come
within
ten
yards
groaned
katrine
i
wish
they
go
away
they
make
me
so
nervous
horrible
to
feel
your
every
stroke
is
being
watched
i
put
in
my
chimney
quite
crooked
are
they
troubling
miss
aubrey
i
wonder
gwethyn
stood
up
to
command
a
full
view
of
the
street
yes
miss
aubrey
was
also
surrounded
by
a
small
crowd
but
she
took
no
notice
of
the
spectators
and
was
painting
away
as
if
oblivious
of
their
presence
she
does
seem
to
mind
commented
gwethyn
i
wish
i
her
nerve
they
seem
to
find
us
as
attractive
as
a
dancing
bear
groaned
katrine
that
fat
old
man
in
the
blue
flannel
shirt
is
gazing
at
us
with
the
most
insinuating
smile
do
look
at
him
oh
why
did
you
encouraged
him
so
much
he
coming
to
speak
to
us
the
wearer
of
the
blue
shirt
appeared
to
think
he
was
doing
a
kind
action
in
patronizing
the
strangers
his
smile
broadened
he
forced
his
way
forward
among
the
pushing
children
and
opened
the
conversation
with
a
preliminary
cough
be
you
that
old
house
across
there
he
began
consequentially
why
it
be
full
o
cracks
and
stains
and
wanted
pullin
down
these
ten
year
or
more
it
beautiful
replied
katrine
briefly
beautiful
with
the
tiles
all
cracked
and
the
wall
bulgin
now
if
you
was
wantin
a
house
to
draw
you
should
done
mine
it
a
new
red
brick
with
bow
windows
and
a
slated
roof
and
there
a
row
o
nice
tidy
iron
railings
round
the
garden
too
you
must
come
and
take
a
look
at
it
we
like
the
old
cottages
better
thank
you
said
gwethyn
as
politely
as
she
could
would
you
please
mind
moving
a
little
to
the
left
standing
just
exactly
in
my
light
he
a
picturesque
figure
whispered
katrine
as
their
new
acquaintance
heaved
himself
heavily
from
the
then
she
added
aloud
i
wonder
if
you
mind
standing
still
a
minute
or
two
and
letting
me
put
you
into
my
picture
yes
just
there
please
you
wants
to
take
i
he
guffawed
well
i
never
did
best
let
me
go
home
and
tidy
up
a
bit
first
no
no
i
like
you
as
you
are
do
move
only
keep
still
for
three
minutes
implored
katrine
sketching
with
frantic
haste
i
do
know
what
my
missis
would
say
at
i
being
took
in
my
corduroys
remonstrated
the
model
who
appeared
half
bashful
and
half
flattered
at
the
honour
thrust
upon
him
i
change
to
my
sunday
clothes
if
wait
a
bit
missie
well
it
be
queer
taste
for
sure
i
thought
a
suit
o
broadcloth
would
looked
a
sight
better
in
a
picture
see
the
lady
she
in
abel
barnes
gasped
the
children
crowding
yet
nearer
and
almost
upsetting
the
pair
of
easels
in
their
excitement
there
his
head
there
be
his
arm
oh
and
his
legs
too
it
be
just
like
him
so
it
be
keep
back
and
let
the
ladies
alone
commanded
abel
in
a
stentorian
voice
where
are
your
manners
got
to
if
you
finished
missie
you
maybe
not
object
to
my
takin
a
look
well
for
sure
there
i
be
to
the
life
wherever
that
picture
goes
in
all
the
world
abel
barnes
will
go
with
it
piped
a
small
awestruck
voice
in
the
background
yes
she
take
me
away
with
her
replied
abel
in
a
tone
that
implied
some
gratification
perhaps
a
touch
of
vanity
lingered
under
the
blue
flannel
shirt
if
i
but
in
my
sunday
clothes
he
continued
regretfully
still
you
only
to
say
the
word
and
i
put
on
for
you
any
day
you
a
mind
to
take
i
again
and
you
could
draw
the
missis
too
and
the
house
if
you
like
i
were
goin
to
give
the
railings
a
fresh
coat
o
paint
anyways
so
i
may
as
well
do
it
afore
you
begins
finding
that
katrine
would
not
commit
herself
to
any
rash
promises
he
finally
strolled
away
possibly
to
buy
a
tin
of
paint
or
to
review
his
sunday
garments
in
anticipation
of
the
portrait
the
children
filled
with
envy
at
his
distinction
were
all
eager
to
volunteer
as
models
and
began
posing
in
the
road
in
various
stiff
and
photographic
attitudes
put
in
i
put
in
i
implored
each
and
all
i
sha
put
in
anybody
if
you
do
behave
yourselves
replied
katrine
severely
how
can
i
see
anything
when
you
standing
exactly
in
front
of
me
go
away
at
once
and
leave
us
quiet
to
remove
themselves
from
the
vicinity
of
the
interesting
strangers
was
however
not
at
all
in
the
children
calculations
they
only
backed
and
formed
a
close
ring
again
round
the
exasperated
girls
breathing
heavily
and
keeping
up
a
chorus
of
whispered
comments
katrine
and
gwethyn
sighed
ruefully
but
judged
it
better
to
follow
miss
example
and
take
no
notice
hoping
that
their
tormentors
might
presently
tire
and
run
off
to
play
marbles
or
the
cottage
proved
by
no
means
an
easy
subject
to
sketch
it
needed
very
careful
spacing
and
drawing
before
they
could
secure
a
correct
outline
it
would
have
been
hard
enough
if
they
had
been
alone
and
undisturbed
but
to
be
obliged
to
work
in
full
view
of
a
frank
and
critical
audience
was
particularly
trying
every
time
they
rubbed
anything
out
a
small
voice
would
cry
missed
again
she
ca
do
it
i
never
realized
before
how
often
i
used
my
murmured
poor
gwethyn
they
seem
to
think
i
making
a
series
of
very
bad
shots
i
wonder
if
i
dare
begin
my
sky
or
if
i
ought
to
show
the
drawing
to
miss
aubrey
first
said
katrine
i
believe
i
shall
venture
how
i
wish
a
would
come
along
and
scatter
these
wretched
infants
or
that
their
mothers
would
call
them
in
for
a
meal
there
was
no
such
luck
the
sight
of
the
mixing
of
cobalt
blue
and
naples
yellow
on
katrine
palette
only
caused
the
children
to
press
yet
closer
oh
look
this
lady
be
doing
it
in
colours
they
shouted
she
be
cleverer
than
the
other
lady
katrine
we
must
get
rid
of
them
exclaimed
the
outraged
gwethyn
then
turning
to
the
crowd
of
shock
heads
behind
she
inquired
frowningly
how
is
it
you
not
in
school
it
a
holiday
came
in
prompt
chorus
there
the
board
of
guardians
meeting
at
the
schoolhouse
explained
an
urchin
poking
a
chubby
face
in
such
close
proximity
to
that
in
she
gave
him
a
dab
of
blue
on
his
freckled
nose
it
be
luck
for
us
when
they
have
their
meetings
volunteered
another
gleefully
but
not
for
us
groaned
gwethyn
katrine
i
wonder
if
the
church
catechism
would
rout
them
i
declare
i
try
it
my
last
weapon
vain
hope
alas
if
gwethyn
had
expected
to
thin
the
throng
by
acting
catechist
she
was
much
mistaken
the
children
had
been
well
grounded
at
sunday
school
and
so
far
from
quailing
at
the
questions
were
anxious
to
air
their
knowledge
and
show
off
before
visitors
ask
i
i
can
say
it
all
from
or
to
with
all
men
piped
a
too
willing
voice
be
you
to
give
i
sweets
for
saying
it
inquired
another
with
an
eye
to
business
katrine
i
shall
have
to
beat
a
retreat
murmured
gwethyn
impossible
to
paint
a
stroke
with
this
sticky
little
crew
buzzing
round
like
flies
i
do
like
being
a
public
character
i
had
enough
notoriety
this
morning
to
last
for
the
rest
of
my
life
now
then
you
young
rascal
if
you
lay
a
finger
on
that
i
shall
call
on
the
schoolmaster
and
ask
him
to
spank
you
at
this
juncture
much
to
the
girls
relief
miss
aubrey
came
to
criticize
their
sketches
she
pointed
out
the
mistakes
in
their
drawings
and
waited
while
they
corrected
them
it
no
use
beginning
the
painting
she
remarked
in
a
low
tone
the
children
are
too
great
a
nuisance
i
did
not
know
about
the
board
of
guardians
meeting
or
i
would
not
have
brought
you
this
morning
we
must
come
another
time
when
these
small
folk
are
safely
in
school
and
we
can
work
undisturbed
i
afraid
you
must
have
found
them
very
troublesome
the
ten
plagues
of
egypt
were
in
it
replied
gwethyn
joyfully
closing
her
and
beginning
to
pack
up
her
traps
you
had
a
crowd
too
oh
i
more
accustomed
to
it
though
i
admit
i
rather
dispense
with
an
audience
if
you
want
to
be
an
artist
you
have
to
learn
to
put
up
with
this
kind
of
thing
never
mind
i
promise
our
next
subject
shall
be
in
an
absolutely
retired
spot
where
no
one
can
find
us
out
chapter
iv
the
school
mascot
although
katrine
had
come
to
aireyholme
primarily
to
study
art
she
did
not
escape
with
respect
to
other
lessons
franklin
was
a
martinet
where
work
was
concerned
she
often
remarked
that
she
did
not
approve
of
young
people
wasting
their
time
and
she
certainly
endeavoured
to
put
her
principles
into
practice
she
taught
the
sixth
form
herself
some
of
the
girls
were
preparing
for
their
matriculation
and
received
special
private
coaching
from
a
professor
who
came
twice
a
week
from
carford
but
all
whether
they
were
going
in
for
the
examination
or
not
were
taking
the
same
general
course
katrine
had
pursued
her
studies
at
hartfield
high
school
with
very
languid
interest
and
had
joyfully
abandoned
them
in
favour
of
the
art
school
she
was
not
at
all
enthusiastic
at
being
obliged
to
continue
her
ordinary
education
and
indeed
considered
the
classes
in
the
light
of
a
grievance
it
was
humiliating
to
find
herself
behind
the
rest
of
the
form
in
mathematics
to
stumble
in
the
french
translation
and
make
bad
shots
at
botany
particularly
so
before
viola
webster
who
listened
to
her
mistakes
and
halting
recitations
with
a
superior
smile
or
an
amused
glance
at
diana
bennett
if
we
had
had
you
at
aireyholme
the
last
year
or
two
you
would
have
reached
a
much
higher
standard
by
now
said
franklin
you
must
do
your
best
to
make
up
for
lost
time
an
extra
preparation
every
day
would
do
you
no
harm
you
might
get
up
a
little
earlier
in
the
mornings
katrine
whose
object
was
not
so
much
to
repair
the
gaps
left
in
her
education
by
the
hartfield
high
school
as
to
amble
through
the
present
term
with
the
least
possible
exertion
of
her
brains
received
the
suggestion
coldly
and
forbore
to
act
upon
it
it
all
very
well
for
the
matric
girls
to
get
up
at
six
and
swat
but
you
wo
find
me
trying
it
on
she
assured
gwethyn
in
private
what
does
it
matter
whether
i
can
work
a
rubbishy
problem
or
patter
off
a
page
of
french
poetry
i
got
to
take
the
classes
worse
luck
but
all
the
franklins
in
the
world
sha
make
me
grind
between
katrine
and
the
principal
there
existed
a
kind
of
armed
neutrality
franklin
persisted
in
regarding
her
as
an
ordinary
pupil
while
katrine
considered
that
she
had
come
to
school
on
a
totally
different
footing
neither
would
yield
an
inch
franklin
was
masterful
but
katrine
was
gently
stubborn
it
is
impossible
to
make
a
girl
work
who
is
determined
to
idle
at
art
katrine
was
prepared
to
slave
and
she
had
already
begun
to
worship
miss
aubrey
but
as
a
member
of
the
sixth
form
she
was
the
champion
slacker
the
principal
by
turns
tried
severity
cajoling
and
sarcasm
a
most
talented
essay
she
remarked
one
day
handing
back
an
untidy
manuscript
one
might
regard
it
as
a
study
in
tautology
the
word
occurs
seven
times
in
a
single
page
it
is
scarcely
usual
for
a
girl
of
seventeen
to
make
twelve
mistakes
in
spelling
i
never
could
spell
answered
katrine
serenely
then
it
time
you
learnt
your
writing
also
is
sprawling
and
careless
and
you
have
no
idea
of
punctuation
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
the
neat
beautifully
expressed
essays
that
ermengarde
used
to
write
they
were
models
of
composition
and
tidiness
a
suppressed
smile
passed
round
the
form
the
subject
of
ermengarde
was
a
perennial
joke
among
the
girls
franklin
did
not
approve
of
holding
up
present
pupils
as
patterns
for
fear
of
fostering
their
vanity
so
she
generally
quoted
her
daughter
as
an
epitome
of
all
the
virtues
it
was
common
knowledge
in
the
school
that
achievements
had
acquired
an
which
at
the
time
they
certainly
did
not
justify
so
far
from
being
a
shining
ornament
of
aireyholme
she
had
generally
lagged
in
the
wake
of
her
form
she
had
bitterly
disappointed
her
mother
by
barely
scraping
through
her
matriculation
and
failing
to
win
a
scholarship
for
college
poor
ermengarde
had
no
gift
for
study
she
was
not
particularly
talented
in
any
direction
and
shirking
the
various
careers
which
franklin
urged
upon
her
had
taken
fate
into
her
own
hands
by
marrying
a
curate
albeit
he
was
impecunious
and
not
at
all
clever
thank
goodness
as
she
confided
to
her
intimate
friends
when
matrimony
had
debarred
ermengarde
from
any
possibility
of
a
college
degree
her
mother
took
it
for
granted
that
she
would
have
obtained
honours
if
she
had
only
tried
for
them
and
always
spoke
of
her
with
regretful
admiration
as
one
who
had
laid
aside
the
laurels
of
the
muses
for
the
duster
of
domesticity
saint
ermengarde
so
the
girls
called
her
in
mockery
lived
therefore
as
a
kind
of
school
tradition
and
she
would
have
been
very
much
surprised
indeed
had
she
known
the
extent
to
which
her
modest
efforts
had
been
magnified
gwethyn
who
had
been
placed
in
the
fifth
form
found
her
level
more
quickly
than
did
katrine
in
the
sixth
her
high
spirits
and
ways
commended
her
to
most
of
her
new
companions
she
had
a
racy
method
of
speech
and
a
humorous
habit
of
exaggeration
that
were
rather
amusing
fresh
from
at
the
hartfield
high
school
she
fell
easily
into
the
work
of
the
form
and
if
she
did
not
particularly
distinguish
herself
gave
no
special
trouble
the
spirited
sketch
which
she
made
of
miss
spencer
on
nose
and
book
in
hand
was
considered
to
the
life
and
she
was
enough
to
make
no
less
than
five
copies
of
it
at
the
earnest
request
of
prissie
yorke
susie
parker
rose
randall
beatrix
bates
and
dona
matthews
her
drawings
of
imps
and
goblins
with
which
she
speedily
decorated
the
of
her
new
were
immensely
admired
general
feeling
inclined
to
the
opinion
that
while
katrine
gave
herself
airs
gwethyn
was
the
right
sort
and
might
be
adopted
with
due
caution
into
the
heart
of
the
form
it
would
of
course
be
unwise
to
make
too
much
fuss
of
her
in
the
beginning
every
new
girl
must
go
through
her
novitiate
of
snubbing
but
such
a
jolly
specimen
as
this
would
not
be
long
in
settling
into
aireyholme
ways
the
had
arrived
on
april
they
had
therefore
been
a
little
more
than
a
week
at
the
school
when
the
of
may
ushered
in
the
summer
may
day
was
kept
with
great
ceremony
at
heathwell
the
old
festival
abandoned
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
had
been
revived
lately
in
the
village
largely
at
the
instance
of
miss
aubrey
whose
artistic
spirit
revelled
in
such
picturesque
scenes
she
had
persuaded
boswell
the
local
squire
to
place
a
on
a
small
green
near
the
market
hall
and
she
had
herself
taught
the
children
of
the
council
school
a
number
of
charming
folk
dances
the
schoolmaster
and
the
vicar
both
approved
of
the
movement
and
gave
every
facility
and
encouragement
and
the
children
themselves
were
highly
enthusiastic
this
year
it
was
proposed
to
have
a
more
than
usually
elaborate
performance
and
to
take
a
collection
in
the
streets
in
aid
of
the
prince
of
wales
fund
may
day
fortunately
fell
on
a
saturday
so
as
the
festival
had
been
well
advertised
it
was
hoped
that
visitors
would
come
over
from
carford
and
other
places
in
the
neighbourhood
though
the
actual
pageant
was
to
be
given
by
the
council
school
children
the
girls
at
aireyholme
rendered
very
valuable
help
they
made
some
of
the
dresses
plaited
garlands
stitched
knots
of
coloured
ribbons
and
last
but
not
least
were
responsible
for
the
collecting
fifteen
of
the
seniors
wearing
union
jack
badges
on
their
hats
and
broad
bands
of
tricolour
ribbon
tied
under
one
arm
and
across
the
shoulder
were
set
apart
for
the
task
each
carrying
a
wooden
box
labelled
prince
of
wales
fund
the
festivities
were
to
begin
at
three
to
fit
in
with
the
times
of
the
local
railway
trains
the
morning
was
a
busy
whirl
of
preparation
miss
aubrey
with
the
monitresses
as
special
helpers
flitted
backwards
and
forwards
between
aireyholme
and
the
village
making
last
arrangements
and
putting
finishing
touches
katrine
and
gwethyn
had
never
before
had
the
opportunity
of
witnessing
such
a
spectacle
so
they
were
full
of
excitement
at
the
prospect
at
two
franklin
mistresses
and
girls
sallied
forth
to
the
scene
of
action
and
secured
an
admirable
position
on
the
steps
of
the
market
hall
whence
they
could
have
a
good
view
of
the
proceedings
it
was
a
balmy
sunny
day
and
the
lovely
weather
combined
with
the
quaint
programme
had
tempted
many
visitors
from
various
places
in
the
district
the
trains
arrived
full
and
heathwell
for
once
was
overflowing
not
only
had
people
made
use
of
the
railway
but
many
had
come
on
bicycles
and
added
to
the
crush
the
local
shops
and
even
the
cottages
had
taken
advantage
of
the
occasion
to
sell
lemonade
and
ginger
beer
and
had
hung
out
signs
announcing
their
willingness
to
provide
teas
and
store
cycles
the
village
was
and
the
general
atmosphere
was
one
of
jollity
and
enjoyment
the
children
were
waiting
in
the
school
under
the
superintendence
of
their
teachers
and
miss
aubrey
precisely
as
the
church
clock
struck
three
the
procession
started
it
was
led
by
the
band
of
the
local
corps
of
boy
scouts
the
drummer
very
proud
indeed
in
the
possession
of
the
orthodox
leopard
skin
which
had
been
presented
only
the
week
before
by
a
local
magnate
after
the
scouts
came
a
number
of
children
dressed
in
kate
greenaway
costumes
and
carrying
may
knots
sticks
surmounted
with
wreaths
of
flowers
and
green
leaves
a
band
of
little
ones
representing
fairies
heralded
the
approach
of
the
may
queen
who
drove
in
great
state
in
a
tiny
carriage
drawn
by
a
very
small
shetland
pony
led
by
a
page
resplendent
in
ribbons
and
buckles
the
carriage
was
so
covered
with
flowers
that
it
well
resembled
the
car
of
friga
the
spring
goddess
of
scandinavian
mythology
who
gave
her
name
to
friday
no
deity
classic
or
teutonic
could
have
been
prettier
than
the
little
maiden
who
sat
up
stiffly
trying
with
great
dignity
to
support
her
regal
honours
her
courtiers
walked
behind
her
and
after
came
a
band
of
morris
dancers
jingling
their
bells
as
they
went
the
pageant
paraded
down
the
high
street
made
a
circuit
round
the
market
hall
and
drew
up
round
the
on
the
strip
of
green
a
platform
had
been
erected
here
with
a
throne
for
the
queen
so
her
little
majesty
was
duly
handed
out
of
her
carriage
and
installed
in
the
post
of
honour
amid
ringing
cheers
the
crown
was
placed
on
her
curly
head
and
the
sceptre
delivered
to
her
while
small
courtiers
bowed
with
a
very
excellent
imitation
of
mediæval
grace
what
an
absolute
darling
the
queen
is
remarked
gwethyn
who
with
katrine
was
an
ecstatic
spectator
it

village

at
that
tiny
wee
chap
who

just
by
the
pony
that
hugh
gartley
is
he
an
absolute
cherub
we
had
him
for
a
model
at
the
studio
we
call
him
school
mascot
because
he
brought
us
such
luck
miss

successes
for

sweetest
little
rascal

franklin

resist
patting
him
on
the
head
and
giving
him
biscuits
he
an
absolute
angel
agreed
the
marsdens
enthusiastically
when
the
coronation
of
the
may
queen
was
duly
accomplished
the
sports
began
a
band
of
dainty
damsels
holding
coloured
ribbons
plaited
and
unplaited
the
much
to
the
admiration
of
the
crowd
who
encored
the
performance
the
fairies
gave
a
pretty
exhibition
waving
garlands
of
flowers
as
they
trod
their
fantastic
measure
the
morris
dancers
capered
their
best
and
the
boy
scouts
band
did
its
utmost
in
providing
the
music
it
was
a
very
charming
scene
so
quaint
amid
the
setting
of
the
picturesque
village
that
the
spectators
clapped
and
cheered
with
heartiest
approval
the
little
actors
excited
by
the
applause
began
to
go
beyond
control
and
to
run
about
waving
their
garlands
and
shouting
hurrah
the
crowd
also
was
breaking
up
a
train
was
nearly
due
and
some
of
the
visitors
made
a
rush
for
the
station
a
with
three
horses
started
from
the
bell
and
dragon
at
that
identical
moment
little
hugh
gartley
seeing
some
attraction
on
the
opposite
pavement
threw
discipline
to
the
winds
and
dashed
suddenly
across
the
road
in
front
of
the
very
wheels
of
the
passing
katrine
happened
to
be
watching
him
with
a
leap
and
a
run
she
was
down
the
steps
of
the
market
hall
and
in
the
street
before
the
child
or
anyone
else
realized
his
danger
she
had
snatched
him
from
the
front
of
the
horses
and
had
dragged
him
on
to
the
pavement
the
driver
pulled
up
in
considerable
alarm
it
not
my
fault
he
protested
kids
should
bolt
across
like
that
finding
there
was
no
harm
done
he
drove
on
the
incident
was
over
so
quickly
that
it
was
hardly
noticed
by
the
general
public
little
hugh
gartley
much
scared
clung
crying
to
katrine
hand
she
took
him
in
her
arms
and
comforted
him
with
chocolates
he
made
friends
readily
and
instead
of
rejoining
the
may
dancers
insisted
upon
staying
with
her
for
the
rest
of
the
performance
katrine
was
fond
of
children
and
enjoyed
petting
the
pretty
little
fellow
she
kept
him
by
her
until
the
procession
passed
on
its
return
to
the
schoolhouse
then
she
made
him
slip
in
amongst
the
other
masqueraders
the
fifteen
collectors
had
been
busy
all
the
afternoon
handing
round
their
boxes
and
anticipated
quite
a
good
harvest
i
should
be
surprised
if
we
taken
seven
or
eight
pounds
many
people
put
in
silver
said
diana
bennett
it
will
be
grand
when
the
boxes
are
opened
you
missed
the
excitement
near
the
market
hall
volunteered
coralie
katrine
marsden
rescued
hugh
gartley
from
being
run
over
she
snatched
him
back
just
in
the
nick
of
time
oh
it
was
nothing
protested
katrine
indeed
it
was
splendid
presence
of
mind
he
might
have
been
killed
if
you
had
dashed
down
so
promptly
and
snatched
him
katrine
action
in
saving
the
school
mascot
was
soon
noised
abroad
among
the
girls
and
brought
her
a
quite
unexpected
spell
of
popularity
chiefly
with
the
juniors
and
the
fifth
form
however
the
sixth
led
by
the
monitresses
still
hung
back
jealous
of
their
privileges
and
unwilling
to
tolerate
one
who
persisted
in
considering
herself
a
parlour
boarder
and
as
they
expressed
it
putting
on
side
it
was
really
mostly
katrine
own
fault
her
previous
acquaintance
with
school
life
ought
to
have
taught
her
wisdom
but
seventeen
is
a
crude
age
and
not
given
to
profiting
by
past
experience
some
of
the
she
sustained
were
well
deserved
on
the
evening
of
may
day
being
a
saturday
as
well
as
a
special
festival
the
monitresses
decided
to
give
a
cocoa
party
in
their
study
and
invite
the
rest
of
the
form
we
got
eight
pounds
fifteen
and
twopence
halfpenny
in
the
collecting
boxes
this
afternoon
announced
viola
and
we
ought
to
drink
the
health
of
the
prince
of
wales
fund
in
cocoa
we
have
a
little
fun
too
just
among
ourselves
all
serene
agreed
diana
this
child
always
ready
for
sport
what
about
biscuits
we
may
send
out
for
what
we
like
i
interviewed
the
great
panjandrum
and
she
was
affability
itself
good
cocoanut
fingers
for
me
and
perhaps
a
few
savoys
make
your
list
tomlinson
is
to
go
and
fetch
them
we
shall
have
to
borrow
cups
from
the
kitchen
said
dorrie
who
had
been
investigating
inside
the
cupboard
since
that
last
smash
rather
low
down
in
our
china
only
four
cups
left
intact
go
and
ask
the
cook
for
five
more
then
five
that
only
make
nine
quite
enough
are
you
going
to
invite
katrine
marsden
viola
pulled
a
long
face
is
it
necessary
she
does
consider
herself
one
of
the
sixth
but
she
is
really
it
seems
rather
marked
to
leave
her
out
oh
well
rather
icily
ask
her
if
you
like
of
course
i
sure
i
do
want
to
keep
her
out
of
things
if
she
cares
to
join
in
dorrie
accordingly
ran
up
to
the
studio
where
katrine
was
sitting
putting
a
few
finishing
touches
to
the
study
of
tulips
upon
which
she
had
been
engaged
during
the
last
week
we
having
a
cocoa
party
at
eight
in
our
study
awfully
pleased
to
see
you
just
our
own
form
announced
dorrie
heartily
thanks
very
much
returned
katrine
casually
but
i
really
do
think
i
shall
have
time
to
come
i
want
to
finish
these
tulips
is
it
getting
too
dark
for
painting
oh
no
the
light
good
for
some
time
yet
and
miss
aubrey
probably
coming
upstairs
to
go
on
with
her
study
i
love
sitting
with
her
she
most
inspiring
comme
vous
voulez
mademoiselle
answered
dorrie
retiring
in
high
dudgeon
to
report
to
her
they
were
most
indignant
at
the
slight
cheek
turns
up
her
nose
at
our
invitation
does
she
she
can
please
herself
i
sure
she
no
loss
at
any
rate
look
here
said
dorrie
i
got
an
idea
we
pay
her

at
eight
an
extremely
jolly
party
assembled
in
the
little
room
underneath
the
studio
all
prepared
to
abandon
themselves
to
enjoyment
to
crack
jokes
sing
catches
ask
riddles
or
indulge
in
anything
that
savoured
of
fun
there
were
not
chairs
for
all
but
nobody
minded
sitting
on
the
floor
viola
was
on
the
table
and
the
kettle
steamed
cheerily
tins
of
cocoa
and
condensed
milk
and
packets
of
biscuits
were
spread
forth
with
the
row
of
cups
and
saucers
miss
aubrey
throned
in
a
with
girls
quarrelling
for
the
privilege
of
sitting
near
her
held
a
kind
of
impromptu
court
it
been
a
ripping
may
day
everybody
was
saying
how
well
engineered
the
whole
thing
viola
assured
her
the
folk
dances
were
just
too
sweet
those
americans
who
came
in
that
big
car
were
in
raptures
they
dropped
half
a
sovereign
into
my
box
they
said
the
may
queen
was
the
prettiest
child
they
ever
seen
mary
gartley
is
only
second
to
hugh
replied
miss
aubrey
i
hear
the
little
chap
nearly
got
run
over
this
afternoon
and
katrine
marsden
rescued
him
where
is
katrine
by
the
by
for
a
moment
an
awkward
silence
reigned
she
in
the
studio
we
invited
her
but
she
would
come
volunteered
dorrie
at
last
oh
said
miss
aubrey
with
a
gleam
of
comprehension
upstairs
katrine
was
painting
away
rather
she
wondered
why
her
beloved
did
not
arrive
it
would
be
delightful
to
have
her
all
to
herself
without
those
schoolgirls
the
door
burst
open
and
gwethyn
came
rushing
tumultuously
in
kattie
the
fifth
are
giving
a
mad
hatter
party
we
going
to
have
the
most
screaming
fun
they
asked
you
so
do
come
quick
oh
i
do
care
about
it
child
i
waiting
here
for
miss
aubrey
miss
aubrey
why
she
gone
to
the
sixth
form
party
i
saw
her
walking
into
their
study
with
a
box
of
chocolates
and
a
bag
of
something
in
her
hand
they
at
it
hard
a
glimpse
of
katrine
face
at
that
moment
might
have
soothed
the
injured
feelings
of
the
monitresses
from
below
rose
unmistakable
sounds
of
mirth
to
confirm
gwethyn
words
are
you
coming
do
hurry
up
urged
gwethyn
impatiently
but
to
join
in
the
festivities
of
the
fifth
form
after
declining
those
of
the
sixth
was
too
great
a
for
katrine
dignity
run
along
baby
i
do
care
for
nonsense
parties
i
rather
stay
and
paint
she
replied
with
an
air
of
that
was
perhaps
slightly
overdone
tantrums
well
you
a
jolly
silly
that
all
i
can
say
for
going
to
have
ripping
fun
chirruped
gwethyn
shutting
the
door
with
a
slam
chapter
v
lilac
grange
so
far
gwethyn
impression
of
aireyholme
had
been
largely
tinged
by
the
prevailing
presence
of
laura
browne
laura
took
her
up
the
very
evening
she
arrived
and
had
since
gushed
over
her
without
intermission
monopolizing
her
almost
entirely
it
was
laura
who
explained
the
school
rules
and
offered
advice
on
the
subject
of
preparation
or
practising
laura
who
walked
with
her
round
the
garden
introduced
her
to
the
library
and
showed
her
the
senior
museum
the
temperature
of
the
friendship
might
be
described
on
laura
side
at
any
rate
as
she
took
complete
possession
of
gwethyn
driving
off
the
other
girls
gently
but
firmly
i
tell
her
all
about
the
lessons
she
would
declare
waving
rose
or
susie
away
come
with
me
dearest
of
course
i
know
our
work
nothing
to
you
after
your
other
school
but
any
help
that
i
can
give
you
you
more
than
welcome
to
it
so
refreshing
to
have
a
girl
like
you
here
after
these
others
oh
anyone
could
see
the
difference
i
fell
in
love
with
you
at
first
sight
look
at
rose
randall
now
it
would
be
impossible
to
be
friends
with
her
i
could
do
it
and
beatrix
and
marian
are
unspeakable
no
darling
until
you
came
i
had
a
chum
in
the
whole
school
as
the
rest
of
the
form
held
slightly
aloof
gwethyn
found
herself
flung
into
the
arms
of
laura
browne
she
had
not
katrine
reserve
and
would
rather
be
friends
with
anybody
than
nobody
she
did
not
altogether
care
for
laura
fawning
manners
but
as
the
intimacy
was
forced
upon
her
she
accepted
it
for
ten
days
they
had
been
dubbed
the
lovers
and
were
constantly
in
each
other
company
i
hear
you
brought
your
violin
sweetest
said
laura
at
recreation
one
morning
as
the
pair
stood
watching
a
set
of
tennis
how
is
it
you
did
tell
me
i
dying
to
hear
you
play
it
oh
i
only
a
beginner
i
brought
it
just
in
case
i
found
time
to
practise
a
little
i
not
taking
lessons
on
it
here
but
you
will
play
for
me
if
you
like
but
it
wo
be
a
treat
i
break
about
a
dozen
strings
every
time
i
tune
it
a
violin
has
four
strings
so
you
must
snip
them
with
a
pair
of
scissors
i
should
think
if
you
break
twelve
each
time
you
tune
up
remarked
a
sarcastic
voice
from
behind
gwethyn
turned
round
and
met
the
scornful
eyes
of
githa
hamilton
that
horrid
child
why
ca
she
let
me
alone
she
whispered
to
laura
she
the
image
of
a
toadstool
with
her
khaki
complexion
and
lank
hair
but
githa
sharp
ears
overheard
thanks
for
the
compliment
khaki
a
nice
patriotic
colour
i
like
my
hair
straight
i
have
the
least
desire
to
friz
it
out
or
curl
it
if
you
going
to
break
a
dozen
strings
tuning
your
fiddle
perhaps
you
save
me
the
pieces
they
make
splendid
lashes
for
whips
to
drive
geese
with
retorted
gwethyn
exactly
how
clever
of
you
to
guess
there
are
a
great
many
geese
in
this
neighbourhood
i
come
in
contact
with
them
every
day
do
mind
the
snarly
little
thing
said
laura
walking
gwethyn
away
now
tell
me
when
i
to
hear
your
violin
shall
we
say
a
two
this
afternoon
in
the
i
play
your
piano
accompaniment
and
i
be
there
for
the
surplus
strings
piped
githa
following
behind
githa
hamilton
take
yourself
off
commanded
laura
routing
the
enemy
at
last
gwethyn
had
not
opened
her
since
coming
to
aireyholme
she
had
taken
lessons
for
about
a
year
and
her
mother
had
urged
her
to
try
and
find
time
to
practise
so
that
she
should
not
forget
all
she
had
learned
but
so
far
there
had
been
so
many
other
things
to
occupy
her
that
the
violin
had
been
entirely
thrust
on
one
side
true
to
her
promise
to
laura
she
brought
it
out
of
its
retirement
this
afternoon
and
going
to
the
began
to
tune
it
by
the
piano
not
a
string
snapped
in
the
process
and
the
instrument
was
soon
in
order
gwethyn
laid
it
down
on
the
table
and
waited
surely
laura
could
not
be
long
she
had
made
the
appointment
for
and
had
expressed
herself
at
dinner
as
impatient
for
the
time
to
arrive
the
minutes
rolled
by
however
and
no
laura
appeared
presently
a
smooth
dark
head
peeped
round
the
door
any
strings
on
hand
inquired
githa
with
an
elfish
grin
i
come
for
that
odd
dozen
you
got
to
spare
i
did
break
any
returned
gwethyn
shortly
bad
news
for
me
well
now
i
suppose
you
at
the
waiting
for
the
beloved
laura
be
turning
up
soon
grunted
gwethyn
sorry
to
break
your
heart
instead
of
your
strings
i
afraid
she
turn
up
it
a
case
of
cometh
not
she
said
the
fair
one
is
false
and
fickle
and
loves
another
if
you
going
to
have
hysterics
or
faint
please
give
me
warning
poor
lone
heart
what
nonsense
you
talking
what
do
you
mean
asked
gwethyn
laughing
in
spite
of
herself
it
the
sad
and
solemn
truth
laura
browne
regardless
of
her
appointment
with
you
is
now
walking
round
the
with
another
love
and
gazing
admiringly
into
her
eyes
your
image
is
wiped
from
her
memory
you
are
a
broken
idol
a
faded
flower
a
past
episode
a
thing
of
yesterday
for
goodness
sake
stop
ragging
well
if
you
prefer
it
in
plain
prose
you
superseded
by
phyllis
lowman
she
franklin
niece
and
comes
occasionally
to
spend
a
few
days
here
she
arrived
just
after
dinner
we
not
keen
on
her
in
the
school
but
laura
truckles
to
her
to
curry
favour
with
mother
franklin
during
her
visit
the
pair
will
be
inseparable
and
your
poor
plaintive
nose
will
be
absolutely
out
of
joint
i
do
believe
you
flared
gwethyn
oh
all
right
go
and
see
for
yourself
it
is
i
who
exaggerate
and
with
a
malicious
little
laugh
the
toadstool
beat
a
retreat
there
were
a
few
minutes
left
before
afternoon
school
so
gwethyn
tired
of
waiting
took
a
run
round
the
garden
alas
githa
had
spoken
the
truth
wandering
amongst
the
gooseberry
bushes
she
met
her
missing
friend
in
company
with
a
stranger
they
were
linked
and
their
heads
were
pressed
closely
together
as
they
passed
gwethyn
laura
eyes
showed
not
a
trace
even
of
recognition
much
less
apology
or
regret
i
been
simply
vegetating
till
you
came
here
again
phyllis
darling
i
living
you
sweetest
the
words
in
laura
most
honied
tones
were
wafted
back
as
the
pair
walked
towards
the
house
gwethyn
looked
after
them
and
stamped
so
that
laura
browne
and
her
fine
friendship
well
i
done
with
her
from
she
wo
catch
me
having
anything
more
to
say
to
her
i
really
think
this
is
the
limit
i
could
have
believed
it
of
her
if
i
had
seen
it
the
utter
sneak
phyllis
lowman
spent
three
days
at
aireyholme
during
which
period
laura
was
her
slave
and
when
she
returned
home
the
latter
turned
her
attention
again
to
her
first
love
but
gwethyn
would
have
none
of
her
and
received
her
advances
in
so
cavalier
a
fashion
that
she
gave
up
the
futile
attempt
at
reconciliation
the
other
members
of
the
fifth
enjoyed
the
little
comedy
it
was
what
they
had
expected
gwethyn
was
bound
to
be
at
first
laughed
susie
parker
it
the
inevitable
laura
new
friendships
have
to
run
their
course
like
measles
this
has
only
been
a
short
business
and
now
we
may
consider
gwethyn
disinfected
no
longer
monopolized
by
laura
gwethyn
began
to
make
friends
with
other
girls
and
was
soon
a
favourite
in
the
fifth
her
love
of
fun
and
readiness
to
give
and
take
commended
her
to
the
form
and
on
her
side
she
much
preferred
to
be
ordinary
chums
with
her
comrades
than
to
be
offered
a
slavish
and
rather
ridiculous
worship
such
as
laura
had
tendered
since
their
very
trying
experiences
in
the
high
street
the
marsdens
had
begged
miss
aubrey
to
allow
them
to
abandon
that
particular
subject
and
begin
another
sketch
in
some
more
retired
place
where
spectators
would
not
come
to
look
over
their
shoulders
miss
aubrey
herself
disliked
working
in
the
midst
of
a
crowd
so
she
readily
agreed
and
at
their
next
painting
lesson
announced
that
she
had
found
the
very
spot
to
suit
them
nan
bethell
gladwin
riley
and
coralie
nelson
were
to
join
the
class
that
afternoon
viola
dorrie
and
diana
were
also
extremely
anxious
to
go
but
franklin
would
not
spare
her
best
matriculation
students
and
sternly
set
them
to
work
at
mathematics
instead
much
to
their
disgust
tita
gray
hilda
smart
and
ellaline
dickens
the
remaining
members
of
the
sixth
were
detained
by
music
lessons
with
a
master
who
came
over
weekly
from
carford
only
five
fortunate
ones
sallied
forth
therefore
with
miss
aubrey
the
subject
which
their
teacher
had
chosen
was
not
far
off
though
rather
out
of
the
way
standing
back
from
the
village
at
the
end
of
a
long
lane
was
a
rambling
old
house
known
as
the
grange
it
lay
low
in
a
somewhat
damp
spot
close
to
the
river
faced
north
and
had
no
particular
view
owing
no
doubt
to
these
drawbacks
and
to
its
inconvenient
situation
it
had
been
unlet
for
several
years
and
as
the
owner
did
not
seem
inclined
to
spend
money
on
repairs
its
dilapidated
condition
held
out
little
promise
of
a
new
tenant
to
anyone
anxious
for
seclusion
no
more
suitable
retreat
could
be
found
the
long
leafy
lane
which
led
to
its
rusty
iron
gate
the
thickness
of
its
surrounding
plantation
the
tall
shrubs
in
the
garden
which
almost
touched
the
windows
all
seemed
so
many
barriers
to
discourage
the
public
and
to
keep
the
lonely
dwelling
apart
from
the
outside
world
to
the
girls
it
looked
mysterious
and
it
was
with
almost
a
creepy
feeling
that
they
opened
the
creaking
gate
and
made
their
way
through
the
tangled
garden
everything
seemed
as
overgrown
and
as
quiet
as
in
the
palace
of
the
sleeping
beauty
not
a
face
to
be
seen
at
the
windows
nor
a
footstep
to
be
heard
in
the
grounds
the
were
a
mass
of
rank
weeds
the
paths
were
covered
with
grass
and
the
lawn
was
a
hayfield
in
the
prime
of
their
beauty
however
were
the
lilac
bushes
they
had
thriven
with
neglect
and
were
covered
with
masses
of
exquisite
blossom
scenting
the
whole
air
and
making
the
garden
a
purple
paradise
the
place
ought
to
be
called
grange
said
katrine
admiringly
it
a
perfect
show
at
present
are
we
to
paint
them
i
afraid
they
would
prove
rather
difficult
i
have
an
easier
subject
for
you
round
at
the
back
said
miss
aubrey
leading
the
way
to
the
rear
of
the
house
where
a
timbered
dovecote
stood
in
the
old
paved
courtyard
with
its
black
beams
and
carved
doorway
it
seemed
of
much
greater
antiquity
than
the
grange
itself
which
had
probably
been
rebuilt
on
the
site
of
an
older
structure
miss
aubrey
found
a
favourable
view
where
the
afternoon
sunshine
cast
warm
shadows
upon
the
plaster
and
she
at
once
set
her
pupils
to
work
to
catch
the
effect
before
the
light
changed
what
a
harbour
of
refuge
this
is
declared
gwethyn
haunted
by
memories
of
the
high
street
there
is
a
single
child
to
come
and
disturb
us
i
call
this
absolute
bliss
and
a
ripping
subject
agreed
katrine
for
a
long
time
the
girls
worked
away
quietly
passing
an
occasional
remark
but
too
busy
to
talk
at
last
the
marsdens
who
drew
more
quickly
than
their
comrades
had
reached
a
stage
at
which
it
was
impossible
to
continue
without
advice
miss
aubrey
was
sketching
the
lilac
round
the
corner
so
leaving
their
easels
they
went
in
search
of
her
not
sorry
to
stretch
their
limbs
for
a
few
minutes
they
decided
first
to
take
a
run
round
the
garden
it
would
be
fun
to
explore
and
katrine
would
get
rid
of
the
pins
and
needles
in
her
foot
under
the
lanky
laurel
bushes
and
overgrown
rose
arches
along
a
swampy
little
path
by
the
river
through
a
broken
and
back
across
a
terrace
not
a
soul
to
be
seen
about
the
whole
place
it
was
peaceful
as
a
palace
of
dreams
stop
what
was
that
rustling
among
the
leaves
there
was
a
movement
under
the
lilac
bushes
and
a
slight
figure
stepped
out
into
the
sunshine
githa
hamilton
whatever
are
you
doing
here
exclaimed
the
girls
the
pale
little
toadstool
looked
more
surprised
than
pleased
at
the
meeting
i
may
return
the
compliment
and
ask
what
you
are
doing
here
she
parried
we
sketching
with
miss
aubrey
and
i
amusing
myself
my
time
my
own
after
school
is
over
she
spoke
aggressively
almost
belligerently
to
judge
from
her
appearance
no
one
would
have
imagined
that
she
had
been
amusing
herself
the
redness
of
her
eyes
suggested
crying
i
going
home
now
for
tea
she
snapped
i
left
my
bicycle
by
the
gate
when
katrine
and
gwethyn
drawings
had
been
duly
corrected
by
their
teacher
and
they
had
settled
down
again
for
the
final
work
they
mentioned
this
meeting
with
githa
to
coralie
who
was
sitting
close
by
what
was
the
queer
child
doing
asked
katrine
i
thought
she
seemed
rather
caught
she
glared
at
us
as
if
she
wished
us
at
timbuctoo
oh
was
githa
here
well
you
see
it
used
to
be
her
old
home
her
grandfather
owned
the
grange
she
and
her
brother
were
orphans
and
lived
with
him
then
when
he
died
they
had
to
go
to
an
uncle
and
the
house
was
to
let
everybody
thinks
they
were
treated
very
hardly
old
ledbury
had
promised
to
provide
for
them
they
were
his
children
but
when
the
will
was
read
there
was
no
mention
of
them
no
one
could
understand
how
it
was
that
he
had
left
them
without
a
penny
he
had
always
seemed
so
fond
of
them
their
uncle
wilfred
ledbury
who
inherited
everything
took
them
to
live
with
him
rather
on
sufferance
the
boy
is
at
a
but
i
do
think
githa
has
a
particularly
nice
time
at
the
gables
what
an
atrocious
shame
exploded
gwethyn
oh
do
misunderstand
me
they
not
exactly
unkind
to
her
sent
to
school
at
aireyholme
and
she
always
quite
nicely
dressed
she
has
her
bicycle
and
she
may
keep
her
pets
in
the
stable
only
her
uncle
just
ignores
her
and
her
aunt
is
sympathetic
or
interested
in
her
with
being
a
she
out
of
all
the
fun
we
boarders
get
i
fancy
she
most
fearfully
lonely
oh
the
poor
little
toadstool
if
i
only
known
that
i
would
have
been
so
rude
to
her
i
was
a
brute
gwethyn
was
really
genuine
i
be
nice
to
her
now
i
will
indeed
do
start
pitying
her
for
goodness
sake
it
the
one
thing
githa
ca
stand
she
as
proud
as
lucifer
and
if
she
suspects
you
the
least
atom
sorry
for
her
it
makes
her
as
hard
as
nails
she
never
lets
us
know
she
not
happy
she
always
makes
out
she
better
off
than
we
are
going
home
every
day
but
i
sure
she
miserable
yes
you
can
see
that
in
her
face
agreed
katrine
impulsive
gwethyn
having
learnt
githa
story
was
anxious
to
atone
for
several
lively
passages
of
arms
and
to
make
friends
but
the
conquest
of
the
toadstool
was
harder
than
she
expected
githa
proud
little
heart
resented
anything
savouring
of
patronage
and
she
repelled
all
advances
no
hedgehog
could
have
been
more
prickly
she
refused
to
play
tennis
declined
the
loan
of
books
and
even
said
no
thank
you
to
proffered
chocolates
instead
of
appearing
grateful
for
the
notice
of
a
girl
in
a
higher
form
she
seemed
to
stiffen
herself
into
an
attitude
of
haughty
reserve
finding
all
attempts
at
kindness
useless
gwethyn
simply
let
her
alone
taking
no
notice
whatever
of
her
and
just
ignoring
pointed
remarks
and
sarcasms
instead
of
returning
them
with
compound
interest
as
formerly
baffled
by
this
new
attitude
the
toadstool
after
trying
her
most
aggravating
sallies
and
failing
to
draw
any
sparks
relapsed
into
neutrality
her
dark
eyes
often
followed
gwethyn
with
an
inscrutable
gaze
but
she
steadfastly
avoided
speaking
to
her
gwethyn
did
not
greatly
concern
herself
for
she
had
found
three
most
congenial
chums
rose
randall
beatrix
bates
and
dona
matthews
were
kindred
spirits
where
fun
was
concerned
and
in
their
society
she
spent
all
her
spare
time
as
for
katrine
she
was
not
likely
to
trouble
about
a
fourth
form
girl
she
just
realized
githa
as
a
plain
and
very
objectionable
junior
but
never
gave
a
thought
to
her
or
her
affairs
at
present
katrine
mind
was
devoted
to
art
and
had
no
corner
to
spare
for
minor
interests
under
miss
aubrey
tuition
she
was
making
strides
and
was
beginning
to
put
on
her
colours
in
a
far
more
professional
manner
she
really
had
a
decided
talent
for
painting
as
well
as
a
love
for
it
and
she
had
come
prepared
to
work
her
teacher
glad
to
find
such
enthusiasm
gave
her
every
encouragement
she
took
her
out
sketching
daily
allowed
her
to
watch
while
she
herself
painted
and
took
infinite
trouble
to
set
her
in
the
way
of
real
art
progress
katrine
easel
had
never
before
had
so
much
exercise
she
planted
it
in
a
variety
of
situations
at
the
instance
of
miss
aubrey
whose
trained
eye
could
at
once
pick
out
suitable
subjects
for
the
brush
heathwell
was
a
very
paradise
for
artists
with
its
deep
lanes
its
hedges
a
tangle
of
honeysuckle
wild
rose
and
white
briony
its
quiet
timbered
farmsteads
set
in
the
midst
of
lush
meadows
its
flowery
gardens
and
its
river
with
reedy
willowy
banks
those
were
halcyon
days
to
katrine
whether
she
sat
in
the
sunshine
among
the
pinks
and
pansies
of
a
cottage
garden
sketching
the
subtle
varied
stones
of
a
gable
against
the
rich
brown
of
a
thatched
roof
the
bees
humming
in
and
out
of
the
flowers
and
the
pigeons
cooing
gently
in
the
dovecote
close
by
or
whether
miss
aubrey
took
her
to
the
shelter
of
thick
woods
where
the
warm
light
shimmering
through
the
leaves
cast
flickering
shadows
on
the
soft
grass
below
there
were
glorious
mornings
when
nature
seemed
to
have
washed
her
children
faces
and
turned
the
world
out
in
clean
clothes
golden
noons
when
all
was
in
a
haze
of
heat
and
the
sky
a
blue
dome
from
horizon
to
zenith
and
still
quiet
evenings
when
the
elms
were
a
blot
of
against
a
pale
yellow
afterglow
and
the
uncut
hayfield
such
a
soft
delicate
blurred
mass
of
indefinite
colour
that
she
gave
up
the
vain
effort
to
depict
it
and
simply
sat
to
gaze
and
wonder
and
enjoy
down
by
the
river
the
calm
pools
would
catch
the
carmine
of
the
sky
till
one
could
fancy
that
one
of
the
ten
plagues
had
returned
to
earth
and
that
the
waters
were
turned
into
blood
each
leaf
of
the
willows
seemed
to
reflect
a
shade
of
warmer
hue
till
all
was
bathed
in
a
glow
of
ruddy
light
and
looking
over
the
gently
quivering
reed
tops
to
the
splendour
across
the
horizon
one
could
almost
see
angels
between
the
cloud
bars
miss
aubrey
who
had
lived
many
years
at
heathwell
had
a
score
of
rustic
acquaintances
the
cottage
folk
often
sat
to
her
as
models
their
quaint
ways
and
ingenuous
remarks
opened
out
a
new
phase
of
the
world
to
katrine
she
became
immensely
interested
in
the
villagers
from
abel
barnes
who
still
urged
the
claims
of
his
villa
as
a
subject
for
her
brush
to
bonny
little
hugh
gartley
whose
cherubic
beauty
she
vainly
tried
to
transfer
to
canvas
she
found
the
gartleys
a
fascinating
family
there
were
so
many
of
them
and
they
were
all
so
fair
and
with
such
ready
smiles
and
winning
manners
how
they
contrived
to
fit
into
their
very
small
cottage
katrine
could
never
imagine
she
had
spoken
once
or
twice
to
the
mother
a
untidy
slatternly
young
woman
whose
income
never
seemed
to
run
to
soap
but
she
avoided
the
father
an
idle
with
a
reputation
for
poaching
it
is
very
difficult
to
help
the
gartleys
said
miss
aubrey
the
children
are
most
attractive
but
it
is
simply
encouraging
pauperism
to
give
to
them
while
bob
gartley
stays
at
home
drinking
and
refusing
to
work
i
hope
you
have
given
them
any
money
only
a
few
pennies
to
hugh
and
mary
they
looked
so
pretty
admitted
katrine
guiltily
chapter
vi
an
awkward
predicament
for
some
days
katrine
had
been
convinced
that
there
was
another
artist
in
the
neighbourhood
she
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
an
easel
fixed
in
a
field
she
had
found
a
tube
of
paint
lying
in
the
road
and
had
noticed
upon
a
paling
the
scrapings
of
a
palette
she
had
not
yet
however
been
vouchsafed
a
sight
of
the
stranger
against
whom
she
had
conceived
a
violent
prejudice
she
had
come
to
regard
heathwell
as
the
private
sketching
property
of
herself
and
miss
aubrey
and
regarded
the
in
the
light
of
a
poacher
on
their
art
preserves
he
or
she
she
did
not
even
know
the
sex
of
the
intruder
might
very
well
have
chosen
some
other
village
in
her
opinion
instead
of
fixing
upon
this
particular
paradise
all
the
same
she
was
inquisitive
and
would
have
liked
very
much
to
see
the
unknown
artist
work
one
afternoon
miss
aubrey
took
the
marsdens
to
a
little
subject
in
a
meadow
on
the
road
to
the
river
she
watched
them
begin
to
draw
in
a
picturesque
railing
and
hawthorn
stump
then
went
herself
to
another
position
in
the
field
left
alone
the
girls
worked
for
some
time
in
silence
katrine
with
absorption
and
gwethyn
in
a
more
dilettante
fashion
the
latter
did
not
care
to
stick
at
things
too
long
she
soon
grew
tired
and
threw
down
her
brush
ugh
it
makes
me
stiff
to
sit
so
still
i
going
to
walk
round
the
pasture
do
come
katrine
oh
how
you
swat
you
might
take
two
rest
we
just
above
the
road
here
and
i
believe
somebody
sitting
down
below
i
can
smell
tobacco
i
going
to
investigate
gwethyn
came
back
in
a
few
moments
with
her
eyes
dancing
it
an
artist
she
whispered
he
painting
in
the
road
exactly
below
us
i
can
see
his
picture
through
the
hedge
come
and
look
such
exciting
information
broke
the
spell
of
katrine
work
she
put
down
her
palette
at
once
and
followed
gwethyn
it
was
impossible
to
resist
taking
a
peep
at
the
interesting
stranger
sketch
you
must
promise
not
even
to
breathe
i
should
be
most
annoyed
if
he
happened
to
see
us
she
declared
all
right
i
be
mum
as
a
mouse
and
walk
as
softly
as
a
i
undertake
it
wo
be
my
fault
if
he
divines
our
existence
very
gently
the
two
girls
crept
along
the
edge
of
the
pasture
trying
not
to
rustle
the
grass
and
heroically
refraining
from
conversation
here
we
are
signalled
gwethyn
at
last
pausing
at
a
thin
place
in
the
hedge
which
might
have
been
made
on
purpose
for
a
through
a
frame
of
sycamore
leaves
they
could
peer
into
the
road
exactly
at
the
spot
where
the
rival
easel
was
pitched
the
artist
back
was
towards
them
they
could
see
nothing
but
his
tweed
suit
his
grey
hair
under
a
brown
hat
and
the
skilful
right
hand
which
kept
dabbing
subtle
combinations
of
upon
his
canvas
he
seemed
utterly
unconscious
of
their
presence
and
worked
away
in
sublime
ignorance
that
two
pairs
of
eyes
were
following
every
stroke
of
his
brush
he
was
no
amateur
that
was
plain
the
girls
were
sufficient
judges
of
painting
to
recognize
that
though
the
sketch
was
still
at
an
elementary
stage
he
had
made
a
masterly
beginning
katrine
watched
quite
fascinated
trying
to
decide
what
colours
he
was
using
and
in
what
proportion
he
had
mixed
them
if
she
could
only
see
his
palette
she
might
perhaps
discover
the
secret
of
that
particularly
warm
shadow
he
was
in
the
act
of
placing
under
the
near
tree
she
craned
her
head
a
little
forward
through
the
hedge
gwethyn
equally
anxious
to
see
everything
possible
pressed
closely
behind
her
whether
it
was
the
heat
of
the
sun
or
whether
a
sycamore
leaf
tickled
the
end
of
her
nose
i
can
not
tell
the
cause
is
immaterial
but
the
awful
and
tangible
result
was
that
katrine
katrine
who
prided
herself
upon
prunes
and
prism
burst
without
warning
into
a
violent
and
uncontrollable
sneeze
naturally
the
artist
turned
at
the
unwonted
sound
to
catch
an
astonishing
vision
of
two
dismayed
faces
peeping
like
dryads
from
the
greenery
behind
him
katrine
dashed
off
like
a
thief
detected
but
she
had
hardly
gone
a
yard
when
gwethyn
seized
her
by
the
arm
katrine
stop
there
no
need
to
run
in
that
silly
way
ca
you
see
it
mr
freeman
what
the
matter
girls
asked
miss
aubrey
who
had
walked
up
to
correct
their
drawings
katrine
felt
caught
on
both
sides
but
there
seemed
nothing
for
it
but
to
pass
off
the
affair
as
well
as
she
could
we
met
an
old
friend
of
my
father
she
explained
i
suppose
we
may
say
do
you
do
to
him
over
the
hedge
if
the
girls
were
surprised
to
see
freeman
he
was
equally
astonished
to
find
them
at
heathwell
did
know
you
were
at
school
here
it
a
grand
part
of
the
world
for
sketching
never
saw
so
many
paintable
bits
in
my
life
my
diggings
are
in
the
village
yes
come
down
and
look
at
my
picture
if
you
like
freeman
had
often
been
a
guest
at
the
marsdens
the
girls
knew
him
well
he
had
criticized
katrine
earliest
art
efforts
and
had
painted
a
portrait
of
gwethyn
when
she
was
about
seven
years
old
he
seemed
to
have
grasped
the
humour
of
the
present
situation
for
he
gazed
up
the
bank
with
twinkling
eyes
katrine
hastily
introduced
miss
aubrey
over
the
top
of
the
hedge
not
a
very
dignified
method
of
presenting
a
friend
but
the
only
one
available
fortunately
miss
aubrey
was
not
franklin
an
invitation
to
make
a
nearer
acquaintance
with
the
picture
was
irresistible
katrine
took
her
teacher
by
the
arm
and
pulled
her
gently
in
the
direction
of
the
gate
she
offered
no
objection
i
was
most
extremely
glad
for
freeman
to
meet
miss
aubrey
katrine
confided
to
gwethyn
afterwards
two
such
good
artists
positively
ought
to
know
each
other
they
each
got
a
picture
in
the
academy
and
is
it
funny
in
the
very
same
room
numbers
and
they
seemed
to
find
plenty
to
talk
about
returned
gwethyn
i
hope
freeman
really
will
look
us
up
at
school
not
only
did
their
artist
friend
take
an
early
opportunity
of
calling
on
them
at
aireyholme
but
he
asked
miss
aubrey
to
bring
them
to
see
his
sketches
in
the
little
studio
he
had
rigged
up
in
the
village
it
was
a
treat
to
be
shown
his
charming
interpretations
of
heathwell
and
its
inhabitants
he
had
already
requisitioned
some
of
the
gartley
children
as
models
and
was
in
ecstasies
over
their
picturesque
appearance
his
study
of
the
high
street
at
sunset
was
a
poem
on
canvas
this
beats
every
other
place
i
ever
stayed
at
for
painting
he
announced
now
i
found
this
studio
i
shall
stop
here
for
the
summer
there
any
amount
to
be
done
you
certainly
find
plenty
of
subjects
round
about
agreed
miss
aubrey
i
wonder
if
the
painting
is
altogether
the
whole
of
the
attraction
mused
gwethyn
who
in
some
respects
was
wise
beyond
her
years
miss
aubrey
was
an
immense
favourite
at
aireyholme
but
among
all
the
girls
she
had
no
stancher
and
more
admirer
than
githa
hamilton
githa
was
not
demonstrative
she
never
said
much
but
whenever
possible
she
haunted
her
idol
like
a
drab
little
shadow
watching
her
with
adoring
eyes
and
hanging
upon
her
words
miss
aubrey
had
a
very
shrewd
suspicion
that
githa
was
lonely
at
home
and
left
out
at
school
realizing
her
peculiar
disposition
she
made
no
great
fuss
over
her
but
every
now
and
then
managed
unobtrusively
to
include
the
girl
in
some
special
expedition
or
particular
treat
at
an
early
date
in
june
she
arranged
to
take
a
few
members
of
the
painting
class
on
a
saturday
excursion
to
chiplow
where
a
fine
old
abbey
would
provide
a
capital
subject
for
an
afternoon
sketching
chiplow
was
on
a
different
line
of
railway
from
carford
therefore
the
heathwell
local
trains
were
of
little
use
in
getting
there
the
quickest
route
was
to
bicycle
to
chorlton
lacy
a
station
on
the
south
midland
line
seven
miles
away
whence
they
could
book
excursion
tickets
to
chiplow
only
girls
possessing
bicycles
were
available
for
the
jaunt
and
as
for
one
reason
or
another
several
of
these
were
obliged
to
be
excluded
miss
aubrey
invited
githa
to
accompany
them
and
make
up
the
dozen
required
for
the
issue
of
the
special
cheap
holiday
bookings
the
poor
little
toadstool
turned
up
radiant
with
delight
and
looking
really
almost
pretty
in
her
cycle
costume
scarlet
tie
and
panama
a
union
jack
fluttered
from
her
machine
and
in
the
basket
which
hung
from
the
she
had
a
store
of
toffee
as
well
as
her
in
spirits
the
party
set
off
along
the
road
riding
in
style
through
the
village
with
much
ringing
of
bells
to
scare
away
children
they
for
nearly
a
mile
downhill
and
then
had
a
splendid
level
stretch
of
road
beside
the
river
bank
we
getting
along
capitally
said
miss
aubrey
at
this
rate
we
shall
be
at
the
station
half
an
hour
too
soon
unless
we
meet
with
some
excitement
ventured
gwethyn
hopefully
if
gwethyn
craved
for
excitement
she
was
soon
to
find
it
they
had
not
gone
half
a
mile
farther
before
their
way
was
barred
by
an
enormous
bull
which
to
judge
by
a
gap
in
the
hedge
must
have
broken
out
of
a
neighbouring
field
there
it
stood
in
a
dip
of
the
road
right
in
their
path
tossing
its
great
head
pawing
the
ground
and
bellowing
lustily
the
cyclists
jumped
off
their
machines
decidedly
scared
by
the
apparition
that
faced
them
oh
but
does
it
look
a
splendid
subject
gasped
katrine
whose
artistic
instincts
were
uppermost
even
at
such
a
crisis
if
we
could
only
draw
it
do
be
idiotic
cried
nan
bethell
it
would
be
like
taking
a
snapshot
of
a
lion
when
it
rushing
at
you
with
open
jaws
i
sure
rosa
bonheur
or
lucy
would
have
sketched
it
then
they
have
been
impaled
one
on
each
horn
and
serve
them
right
for
tempting
providence
look
at
the
dust
the
creature
raising
in
the
road
all
the
party
were
in
consternation
miss
aubrey
who
felt
the
responsibility
of
her
charge
and
moreover
had
a
natural
fear
of
bulls
for
once
almost
lost
her
presence
of
mind
what
are
we
to
do
it
would
be
madness
to
try
and
ride
past
it
i
suppose
we
shall
have
to
turn
back
home
she
fluttered
ca
we
call
for
help
halloo
shouted
some
of
the
girls
there
nobody
about
i
see
a
hat
in
that
field
it
only
a
scarecrow
then
githa
who
had
been
standing
silently
by
her
bicycle
suddenly
assumed
direction
of
the
situation
stop
shouting
you
excite
the
bull
she
commanded
now
let
us
stack
our
machines
in
the
ditch
and
climb
over
this
fence
into
the
field
come
along
quick
this
way
it
seemed
such
excellent
advice
that
even
miss
aubrey
obeyed
quite
meekly
leaving
their
bicycles
below
they
all
scrambled
hastily
up
the
bank
and
over
some
hurdles
into
a
field
we
safe
but
we
shall
lose
our
train
lamented
gladwin
riley
not
a
bit
of
it
we
turn
up
in
time
at
the
station
you
see
replied
githa
just
leave
it
to
me
she
broke
a
stick
from
the
hedge
picked
up
several
large
stones
and
then
ran
along
the
meadow
for
some
distance
and
climbed
another
fence
all
at
once
the
girls
realized
her
intention
she
was
descending
into
the
road
in
the
rear
of
the
bull
stop
her
stop
her
shrieked
miss
aubrey
by
that
time
however
githa
was
down
the
bank
before
the
bull
had
time
to
realize
her
presence
and
turn
round
she
began
a
vigorous
onslaught
with
stones
upon
his
hind
quarters
shouting
at
the
pitch
of
her
lungs
her
sudden
attack
had
exactly
the
effect
she
hoped
the
bull
enraged
by
the
noise
and
the
stones
rushed
blindly
forward
along
the
road
passing
the
bicycles
without
notice
and
stampeding
in
the
direction
of
heathwell
someone
will
stop
him
before
he
gets
into
the
village
murmured
miss
aubrey
at
the
top
of
the
bank
the
brave
little
toadstool
received
an
ovation
as
the
rest
of
the
party
climbed
down
from
the
post
of
vantage
she
took
her
honours
ungraciously
what
the
use
of
making
a
fuss
anyone
with
two
grains
of
sense
would
have
thought
of
it
for
goodness
sake
let
me
get
on
my
machine
we
have
overmuch
time
and
we
do
want
to
miss
our
train
standing
palavering
how
just
exactly
like
githa
hamilton
commented
hilda
smart
as
the
girls
resumed
their
interrupted
ride
after
all
they
arrived
at
the
station
with
five
minutes
to
spare
just
long
enough
to
book
their
excursion
tickets
and
to
leave
their
bicycles
in
the
office
they
were
fortunate
enough
to
find
an
empty
carriage
and
crammed
themselves
in
somehow
it
was
rather
a
tight
fit
for
a
dozen
but
it
felt
so
much
jollier
to
be
all
together
chiplow
was
an
hour
journey
away
a
few
of
the
party
had
been
there
before
but
to
most
it
was
a
new
experience
the
abbey
was
one
of
the
show
places
of
the
county
and
the
old
town
had
a
historic
reputation
there
was
plenty
to
be
seen
in
the
streets
alone
the
houses
were
of
the
sixteenth
century
and
very
picturesque
many
of
them
with
carved
wooden
pillars
and
with
dates
and
over
the
doorways
miss
aubrey
took
her
charges
into
the
church
a
dim
ancient
edifice
with
a
leper
window
a
over
the
pulpit
and
almost
hidden
away
in
the
transept
a
for
scolds
the
girls
looked
at
the
curious
old
instrument
of
punishment
with
great
curiosity
and
githa
who
had
brought
her
camera
took
a
time
exposure
of
it
poor
old
souls
said
katrine
it
was
too
bad
to
souse
them
in
the
pond
just
because
they
waxed
too
eloquent
i
no
doubt
the
husbands
deserved
it
if
everybody
who
talks
too
much
nowadays
were
treated
to
the
cure
we
should
be
a
taciturn
set
it
might
be
a
wholesome
warning
in
some
cases
laughed
miss
aubrey
it
really
very
trying
when
people
babble
on
all
about
nothing
and
insist
upon
one
listening
to
them
after
lunch
at
a
café
in
the
town
the
party
adjourned
to
the
abbey
a
most
romantic
ruin
standing
among
woods
by
the
side
of
a
river
the
monks
of
old
must
have
been
true
artists
to
choose
such
unrivalled
sites
on
which
to
rear
their
glorious
architecture
it
was
an
exquisite
jewel
in
a
perfect
setting
and
miss
aubrey
was
soon
in
ecstasies
over
delicate
pieces
of
tracery
and
perpendicular
windows
she
set
her
class
to
work
on
an
arched
gateway
overhung
by
a
graceful
tree
it
was
not
a
particularly
easy
subject
and
most
of
them
did
not
accomplish
more
than
the
drawing
though
katrine
and
nan
managed
to
put
on
a
little
colour
during
the
last
everyone
was
very
loath
to
leave
when
miss
aubrey
at
last
declared
it
was
time
to
close
the
their
train
was
due
at
six
and
they
must
have
tea
before
starting
so
it
was
impossible
to
linger
any
longer
katrine
had
bought
a
at
the
abbey
and
studied
it
over
the
at
the
café
she
was
dismayed
to
find
how
many
objects
of
interest
in
the
town
they
had
missed
i
should
like
to
see
the
old
house
where
mary
queen
of
scots
stayed
she
exclaimed
it
only
just
down
the
street
here
miss
aubrey
gwethyn
and
i
have
finished
tea
may
we
go
and
look
at
it
we
be
ever
so
quick
you
can
if
you
like
but
do
miss
the
train
if
you
turn
up
cliff
street
exactly
opposite
the
hospital
it
will
bring
you
straight
to
the
station
and
save
your
walking
back
here
six
remember
oh
thank
you
there
heaps
of
time
come
gwethyn
the
marsdens
marched
off
with
their
and
easily
found
the
old
house
in
question
which
was
now
used
as
an
alms
hospital
for
superannuated
and
disabled
soldiers
they
so
dutifully
curtailed
their
inspection
of
it
that
katrine
declared
they
might
safely
go
and
look
at
the
ruins
of
the
city
gate
which
according
to
her
guide
must
be
quite
close
by
whether
the
book
was
unreliable
or
whether
katrine
in
her
haste
missed
the
right
turning
is
uncertain
but
after
wandering
vainly
round
several
streets
the
girls
found
themselves
down
by
the
bank
of
the
river
you
said
we
had
plenty
of
time
but
you
did
look
at
your
watch
panted
gwethyn
if
that
clock
over
there
is
right
we
shall
never
catch
our
train
oh
you
are
a
genius
a
prince
of
katrine
came
to
a
sudden
halt
gwethyn
remarks
were
unpalatable
but
strictly
true
there
were
exactly
ten
minutes
to
spare
to
go
back
to
the
station
would
require
at
least
twenty
it
the
only
train
available
by
our
excursion
tickets
wailed
gwethyn
i
believe
there
a
later
one
about
nine
or
ten
but
they
make
us
pay
the
difference
between
cheap
bookings
and
ordinary
fare
i
can
see
the
glass
roof
of
the
station
across
the
river
and
there
a
bridge
in
front
of
us
it
probably
a
short
cut
and
will
save
half
the
distance
announced
katrine
hopefully
come
along
perhaps
we
can
just
do
it
the
girls
scurried
forward
in
frantic
haste
what
convenient
things
bridges
were
why
of
course
there
was
the
railway
quite
close
on
the
other
side
they
tore
across
the
creaking
planks
in
triumph
feeling
that
every
step
brought
them
nearer
to
the
station
but
alas
for
the
vanity
of
human
wishes
the
farther
side
of
the
bridge
was
closed
by
a
turnstile
and
a
fiend
in
human
form
was
basely
and
mercenarily
demanding
the
one
thing
in
the
world
which
at
present
they
could
not
muster
a
penny
toll
it
seemed
absurd
to
be
in
the
depths
of
destitution
but
it
was
the
fact
they
had
given
the
money
for
the
excursion
to
miss
aubrey
who
acted
as
paymaster
for
the
whole
party
and
the
few
pence
they
had
kept
they
had
spent
on
the
and
some
chocolates
to
be
at
one
last
penny
is
a
proverbial
expression
but
katrine
and
gwethyn
had
never
before
realized
the
dire
extremity
of
being
absolutely
without
a
single
specimen
of
that
useful
coin
of
the
realm
they
rummaged
in
their
pockets
hoping
against
hope
that
some
stray
copper
might
have
slipped
into
an
obscure
corner
and
have
been
overlooked
gwethyn
even
felt
the
bottom
of
her
coat
in
case
a
could
have
strayed
between
the
material
and
the
lining
in
the
meantime
the
keeper
of
the
bridge
stood
with
outstretched
hand
awaiting
his
dues
casting
an
impatient
eye
back
into
his
where
his
tea
was
rapidly
cooling
upon
the
table
we
find
we
have
any
money
with
us
faltered
katrine
at
last
would
you
please
let
us
through
without
and
we
send
you
stamps
could
do
it
responded
the
man
surlily
this
bridge
is
a
cash
concern
and
i
never
give
credit
but
we
want
to
catch
a
train
pleaded
gwethyn
and
there
is
time
to
go
back
through
the
town
our
tickets
are
only
available
by
this
train
and
our
friends
are
waiting
for
us
at
the
station
added
katrine
i
heard
tales
like
this
before
do
you
try
to
come
over
me
you
either
pays
your
pennies
or
you
wo
go
through
this
gate
if
we
left
something
as
a
pledge
cried
katrine
in
despair
here
my
or
my
coat
or
yes
even
my
watch
you
must
let
us
pass
declared
gwethyn
tragically
must
indeed
i
put
here
in
charge
of
the
bridge
and
a
pretty
thing
it
would
be
if
i
was
to
let
everyone
through
i
my
orders
and
i
do
my
duty
said
the
officiously
waving
away
the
articles
which
katrine
was
vainly
trying
to
press
upon
him
the
poor
girls
were
waxing
hysterical
the
precious
moments
were
hurrying
by
and
already
a
suggestive
whistle
in
the
distance
gave
ominous
warning
of
the
approaching
train
to
be
left
behind
in
chiplow
was
a
prospect
too
appalling
even
to
contemplate
they
had
serious
thoughts
of
either
attempting
to
push
past
the
official
or
to
make
a
dash
and
climb
the
railings
both
of
which
proceedings
would
be
equally
undignified
and
illegal
at
this
desperate
and
critical
moment
a
little
figure
suddenly
rushed
up
from
behind
a
gasping
panting
figure
with
hair
flying
in
wild
elf
locks
and
pale
cheeks
scarlet
for
once
open
the
gate
quick
it
commanded
threepence
here
you
are
come
on
we
just
do
it
there
was
no
time
even
to
greet
their
deliverer
the
three
girls
simply
tore
along
the
road
that
led
to
the
station
with
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
signal
which
was
already
down
the
toadstool
was
swift
of
foot
and
had
indomitable
pluck
or
winded
already
she
could
never
have
managed
that
last
wild
spurt
caught
it
by
the
skin
of
our
teeth
exclaimed
katrine
a
minute
and
a
half
later
as
nearly
exhausted
the
girls
were
hustled
into
a
compartment
by
the
distracted
miss
aubrey
just
the
moment
before
the
train
started
oh
dear
i
never
had
such
a
scramble
in
all
my
life
i
half
dead
githa
hamilton
you
an
absolute
trump
whispered
gwethyn
when
she
recovered
sufficient
breath
for
speech
that
horrid
man
would
let
us
through
we
should
have
had
to
stop
in
chiplow
it
was
good
of
you
to
come
after
us
no
it
was
snapped
the
toadstool
rather
gaspily
i
did
it
to
please
miss
aubrey
i
did
care
twopence
about
you
two
she
was
getting
anxious
so
i
said
i
follow
you
and
round
you
up
somehow
a
precious
job
i
had
asking
people
if
they
seen
two
girls
in
panama
hats
whatever
induced
you
to
go
down
by
the
river
you
pair
of
sillies
it
would
have
just
served
you
jolly
well
right
if
you
been
left
in
chiplow
after
all
chapter
vii
the
mad
hatters
if
katrine
was
determined
that
her
career
at
aireyholme
should
be
art
before
all
gwethyn
school
motto
might
be
described
as
fun
at
any
price
her
high
spirits
were
continually
at
effervescing
point
and
she
was
fast
acquiring
the
reputation
of
champion
ragger
of
the
fifth
there
were
rollicking
times
in
the
form
jokes
and
chaff
to
an
even
greater
extent
than
had
obtained
before
her
advent
half
a
dozen
of
the
girls
had
always
been
lively
but
now
under
gwethyn
sway
their
escapades
earned
them
the
title
of
the
mad
hatters
the
influence
spread
downwards
and
infected
the
juniors
eight
members
of
the
fourth
formed
themselves
into
a
league
dubbed
the
march
hares
and
by
the
wildness
of
their
pranks
sought
to
outdo
their
seniors
there
was
a
rivalry
of
jokes
between
them
and
whichever
scored
the
most
points
for
the
time
held
the
palm
needless
to
say
their
efforts
were
scarcely
appreciated
at
things
considered
intensely
diverting
by
the
form
were
viewed
very
differently
by
mistresses
and
monitresses
and
both
hatters
and
hares
were
liable
to
find
themselves
in
trouble
i
have
mentioned
that
katrine
and
gwethyn
slept
in
a
little
room
over
the
porch
the
door
was
in
the
middle
of
a
long
passage
leading
to
other
bedrooms
occupied
by
the
fourth
and
fifth
the
aireyholme
dormitory
discipline
was
tolerably
strict
and
usually
the
girls
were
a
crew
one
morning
some
unlucky
star
caused
gwethyn
to
open
her
eyes
before
the
usual
bell
and
aroused
in
her
a
spirit
of
mischief
taking
her
pillow
she
stole
along
the
passage
to
no
and
awoke
marian
susie
and
megan
come
along
she
proclaimed
let
find
dona
and
beatrix
and
go
and
rout
up
the
march
hares
there
time
for
a
little
artillery
practice
before
the
bell
rings
bolsters
are
heavy
ammunition
and
pillows
light
you
can
take
your
choice
anyone
refusing
to
do
battle
will
be
proclaimed
coward
all
the
fallen
will
be
buried
with
the
honours
of
war
get
up
you
soft
sybarites
finding
their
bedclothes
on
the
floor
and
severe
tickling
the
penalty
of
a
love
for
slumber
the
occupants
of
the
various
dormitories
on
the
landing
turned
out
and
followed
their
leader
hares
versus
hatters
commanded
gwethyn
you
may
duck
and
dodge
but
anyone
fairly
hit
is
to
be
considered
fallen
the
bedrooms
are
trenches
remember
mum
the
word
though
the
battle
began
and
waged
fiercely
the
missiles
flew
hither
and
thither
some
of
the
girls
were
good
shots
but
others
had
the
proverbial
feminine
incapacity
for
a
true
aim
there
were
wildly
thrilling
encounters
frantic
chasings
and
wholesale
routs
in
their
excitement
the
combatants
completely
forgot
the
necessity
for
silence
they
chuckled
groaned
hooted
and
even
squealed
small
wonder
that
long
before
the
fight
was
fought
to
a
finish
an
avenging
deity
in
a
appeared
upon
the
scene
and
proclaimed
a
compulsory
peace
girls
whatever
are
you
doing
demanded
viola
you
ought
to
be
thoroughly
ashamed
of
yourselves
go
back
to
your
rooms
at
once
you
know
this
kind
of
thing
is
not
allowed
the
delinquents
seized
their
missiles
and
beat
a
hurried
retreat
while
viola
who
was
wise
in
her
generation
sounded
the
bell
as
a
signal
for
the
rest
of
the
school
to
rise
and
dress
they
get
into
mischief
again
if
i
leave
them
larking
about
in
their
rooms
and
it
wo
do
anybody
any
harm
to
be
up
a
quarter
of
an
hour
earlier
for
once
she
decided
but
i
see
they
put
in
the
extra
time
at
preparation
the
young
wretches
the
head
girl
was
as
good
as
her
word
she
kept
a
stern
eye
on
the
sinners
directly
they
appeared
downstairs
the
morning
a
good
time
to
work
she
announced
grimly
if
fond
of
early
rising
i
call
you
all
every
day
at
six
and
arrange
for
prep
at
instead
of
at
seven
no
doubt
you
benefit
by
it
the
jokers
who
had
not
calculated
upon
an
increased
allowance
of
school
hours
sought
their
desks
glumly
but
there
was
a
further
trial
in
store
for
them
when
they
were
seated
at
breakfast
franklin
took
her
place
at
the
table
with
an
air
of
and
injured
patience
girls
she
began
in
a
martyred
voice
i
have
been
most
hurt
most
pained
at
what
occurred
this
morning
anything
more
thoughtless
and
inconsiderate
i
could
not
have
imagined
i
had
passed
a
bad
night
and
i
was
snatching
a
short
sleep
when
i
was
awakened
by
an
uproar
that
is
without
all
precedent
when
ermengarde
was
here
such
a
thing
never
occurred
there
was
a
different
spirit
abroad
in
the
school
every
girl
even
the
youngest
junior
was
careful
for
my
comfort
and
would
not
have
dreamed
of
disturbing
me
i
fear
now
an
entirely
selfish
feeling
prevails
in
the
fifth
and
fourth
forms
i
am
grieved
to
see
it
our
traditions
at
aireyholme
have
been
very
high
i
beg
the
standard
may
never
be
lowered
no
names
were
mentioned
but
hares
and
hatters
were
conscious
that
the
eyes
of
the
rest
of
the
school
were
fixed
upon
them
with
scornful
reproach
they
ate
their
breakfast
in
a
state
of
dejection
i
never
dreamed
franklin
would
take
it
that
way
mourned
rose
afterwards
to
her
diana
bennett
says
we
are
a
set
of
brutes
sighed
beatrix
ruefully
she
admired
diana
and
winced
under
her
scorn
the
others
were
wild
at
getting
extra
prep
this
morning
they
ready
to
take
it
out
of
us
remarked
susie
look
here
said
gwethyn
i
think
the
best
way
to
settle
the
whole
business
will
be
to
go
and
apologize
to
franklin
say
we
know
she
had
a
headache
and
we
sorry
that
ought
to
square
things
then
diana
may
stop
nagging
at
the
interval
a
dozen
girls
reported
themselves
at
the
principal
study
and
with
rose
as
spokeswoman
tendered
an
embarrassed
apology
franklin
was
not
inclined
to
treat
the
matter
too
lightly
she
considered
herself
justly
offended
but
after
listening
with
due
gravity
she
solemnly
and
majestically
forgave
them
i
suppose
i
can
not
expect
all
to
be
as
naturally
thoughtful
and
as
ermengarde
she
added
but
i
try
to
stand
in
the
place
of
a
mother
to
you
here
and
i
hope
to
meet
with
some
response
i
am
afraid
franklin
would
have
been
grieved
again
if
she
had
heard
the
laughter
that
ensued
when
the
girls
were
out
of
of
the
study
they
were
really
sorry
to
have
hurt
her
feelings
but
the
mention
of
the
impeccable
ermengarde
was
always
a
subject
for
mirth
i
have
it
on
absolute
authority
that
ermengarde
once
made
another
girl
an
bed
tittered
susie
it
was
nell
stokes
who
told
me
she
was
at
aireyholme
then
and
slept
in
the
same
dormitory
what
happened
history
does
relate
i
should
say
saint
ermie
got
disciplined
and
did
penance
she
was
canonized
then
although
franklin
was
apt
to
be
a
little
pompous
and
over
stately
she
was
very
good
to
the
pupils
on
the
whole
and
they
thoroughly
respected
her
they
sympathized
deeply
with
her
anxiety
for
news
from
the
war
where
her
two
sons
were
serving
their
country
many
of
the
girls
had
brothers
or
cousins
in
the
army
and
each
morning
an
enthusiastic
crowd
collected
to
hear
the
items
which
franklin
read
out
to
them
they
were
not
allowed
to
look
at
the
daily
papers
for
themselves
as
franklin
considered
many
of
the
details
unsuitable
for
their
perusal
but
she
gave
them
a
summary
of
the
course
of
events
with
special
particulars
if
possible
of
regiments
in
which
they
were
interested
the
occasional
letters
received
by
girls
from
relatives
at
the
front
were
subjects
for
great
rejoicing
they
compared
notes
keenly
over
the
experiences
related
katrine
and
gwethyn
scored
considerably
for
their
brother
hereward
was
a
fairly
regular
correspondent
and
gave
vivid
accounts
of
his
campaigning
it
was
at
gwethyn
suggestion
that
the
school
held
what
they
called
a
exhibition
every
girl
with
a
relative
engaged
in
the
war
was
requested
to
lend
his
photograph
any
chance
snapshots
she
might
have
of
him
any
newspaper
cuttings
narrating
his
achievements
and
any
of
his
regimental
buttons
if
she
were
lucky
enough
to
possess
them
these
contributions
were
arranged
on
a
table
with
an
appropriate
background
of
flags
and
sprigs
of
laurel
a
penny
each
was
charged
for
admission
and
catalogues
of
the
exhibits
were
sold
at
one
halfpenny
as
all
the
girls
the
mistresses
and
three
of
the
servants
patronized
the
show
the
sum
of
five
shillings
and
twopence
halfpenny
was
cleared
and
put
in
the
belgian
relief
fund
box
gwethyn
had
wished
to
add
a
competition
with
votes
for
the
handsomest
hero
but
franklin
sternly
vetoed
the
idea
it
would
have
been
ever
such
fun
and
the
girls
would
have
loved
it
gwethyn
assured
her
chums
in
private
but
of
course
i
see
the
reason
franklin
sons
may
be
very
estimable
but
they
both
plain
and
of
course
hereward
photo
would
have
won
the
most
votes
he
by
far
the
you
utter
goose
that
was
the
reason
snubbed
rose
randall
besides
which
if
it
comes
to
a
question
of
looks
your
brother
in
the
running
with
my
cousin
everard
gwethyn
fertile
brain
was
continually
at
work
in
spite
of
the
madness
of
some
of
her
propositions
she
was
really
an
acquisition
to
the
fifth
she
could
always
be
counted
upon
for
new
suggestions
and
on
wet
days
she
would
invent
games
get
up
charades
or
engineer
impromptu
entertainments
with
the
ingenuity
of
a
variety
manager
one
afternoon
the
heavy
rain
prevented
the
girls
from
taking
their
usual
outdoor
exercise
between
dinner
and
school
very
disconsolately
they
hung
about
grumbling
at
the
downpour
only
the
sixth
form
were
privileged
to
use
the
studio
on
such
occasions
the
younger
ones
flung
on
their
own
resources
killed
time
as
best
they
could
the
fourth
suffered
more
particularly
as
it
was
their
afternoon
for
the
tennis
courts
and
they
had
had
bad
luck
lately
in
the
matter
of
weather
on
their
special
tennis
days
i
declare
i
sorry
for
those
poor
kids
said
gwethyn
this
is
the
third
wednesday
their
sets
have
been
stopped
they
are
standing
in
the
corridor
looking
like
a
funeral
ca
we
liven
them
up
somehow
all
serene
let
ask
them
into
our
form
room
and
play
games
agreed
rose
where
are
the
rest
of
us
jill
go
and
hunt
up
susie
and
beatrix
it
far
more
fun
when
there
are
plenty
i
say
you
kiddies
there
come
along
and
have
some
jinks
pass
the
word
on
the
juniors
responded
promptly
to
the
invitation
they
flocked
into
the
fifth
room
and
settled
themselves
anywhere
on
desks
or
floor
what
the
game
they
asked
hopefully
it
quite
a
new
one
explained
gwethyn
who
had
had
a
hasty
private
conference
with
some
of
her
chums
it
called
oracle
of
fortune
i
to
be
blindfolded
so
that
i
ca
see
the
least
peep
then
all
to
march
round
me
in
a
circle
when
i
tap
with
this
stick
you
stop
and
i
point
at
somebody
who
comes
forward
oh
i
know
french
that
nothing
new
exclaimed
madge
carter
no
it
not
french
returned
gwethyn
so
crushingly
that
madge
was
sorry
she
had
spoken
i
do
feel
your
faces
while
you
giggle
it
something
quite
different
i
tell
your
characters
if
they
correct
you
walk
on
if
i
make
a
mistake
you
may
take
my
place
as
oracle
who
to
judge
if
they
right
the
general
opinion
frowned
gwethyn
but
suppose
oh
suppress
that
dormouse
exclaimed
some
of
the
march
hares
where
is
there
a
big
handkerchief
to
bind
your
eyes
you
must
have
the
least
little
teeny
weeny
scrap
of
a
left
we
take
care
of
that
bandaged
to
the
entire
satisfaction
of
all
spectators
gwethyn
took
her
place
in
the
centre
of
the
room
and
the
girls
commenced
to
circle
round
her
at
a
rap
from
her
stick
they
halted
she
pointed
blindly
to
an
unknown
figure
who
stepped
silently
forward
list
to
the
oracle
proclaimed
gwethyn
dramatically
sweet
temper
kindness
and
modesty
here
go
hand
in
hand
pass
on
gentle
maiden
thou
art
worthy
bertha
grant
a
small
and
inoffensive
junior
retired
into
the
ring
amid
the
applause
of
the
audience
and
the
march
continued
at
the
next
halt
myrtle
goodwin
a
particularly
turbulent
and
mischievous
member
of
the
fourth
responded
to
the
rap
whom
have
we
here
murmured
the
oracle
alas
my
inner
sense
tells
me
this
is
imp
not
angel
go
and
amend
thy
misdeeds
i
feel
the
darkness
of
thy
shadow
again
a
round
of
clapping
certified
to
the
correctness
of
the
character
given
the
girls
began
to
think
the
game
rather
fun
laura
browne
happened
to
be
the
next
chosen
fair
on
the
surface
but
false
below
was
the
verdict
the
professed
friend
of
everybody
but
the
chum
of
nobody
full
of
promises
but
shy
of
performance
she
can
see
she
must
be
able
to
see
shouted
the
girls
much
struck
by
the
aptness
of
the
remarks
no
i
ca
not
one
look
at
my
bandages
for
yourselves
declared
gwethyn
emphatically
though
she
murmured
done
you
laura
browne
under
her
breath
does
anybody
imagine
i
can
see
through
two
silk
handkerchiefs
i
have
eyes
the
real
fact
was
that
gwethyn
and
rose
had
arranged
beforehand
a
code
of
signals
the
characters
were
to
be
of
three
classes
good
moderate
and
bad
when
the
march
stopped
and
a
girl
stepped
forward
rose
was
to
give
her
confederate
the
required
information
by
means
of
a
cough
a
tap
on
the
floor
or
a
laugh
for
certain
of
the
girls
special
signals
of
identification
had
been
arranged
laura
was
one
of
these
and
as
luck
would
have
it
the
lot
had
fallen
to
her
early
in
the
game
go
on
and
try
me
again
commanded
gwethyn
anyone
who
likes
may
consult
the
gipsy
at
the
next
halt
rose
signalled
as
usual
and
the
oracle
responded
whom
have
we
here
a
junior
remarkable
for
her
charm
of
disposition
a
girl
with
many
friends
a
favourite
in
her
form
here
gwethyn
was
interrupted
by
an
outburst
of
giggles
wrong
for
once
this
does
fit
the
oracle
not
working
gwethyn
tore
off
the
silk
handkerchiefs
that
bandaged
her
eyes
she
saw
at
once
what
had
happened
amid
the
noise
of
the
tramping
she
had
misinterpreted
rose
signal
junior
bad
for
junior
good
instead
of
addressing
one
of
the
pattern
members
of
the
fourth
she
had
been
eulogizing
githa
hamilton
the
poor
little
toadstool
stood
with
a
very
curious
expression
in
her
dark
eyes
keen
delight
was
just
fading
into
bitter
disappointment
she
looked
round
the
circle
of
tittering
girls
not
one
endorsed
the
good
character
or
had
a
kind
word
to
say
for
her
all
were
clamouring
against
the
falseness
of
this
description
her
face
hardened
gwethyn
perceived
it
in
a
flash
does
she
really
care
what
they
think
of
her
she
speculated
gwethyn
instinct
was
always
to
fight
on
behalf
of
the
losing
side
and
at
this
moment
githa
seemed
to
stand
alone
against
the
whole
room
moreover
the
oracle
was
not
disposed
to
own
up
that
she
had
made
a
mistake
she
stuck
therefore
to
her
guns
if
githa
not
a
favourite
she
ought
to
be
it
your
own
lack
of
appreciation
where
are
your
eyes
she
a
jewel
if
you
the
sense
to
see
it
there
i
sick
of
the
whole
business
if
anybody
likes
to
take
my
place
i
resign
or
shall
we
play
something
else
instead
perhaps
the
girls
thought
the
game
was
growing
rather
too
personal
nobody
offered
to
act
gipsy
and
someone
hurriedly
suggested
clumps
in
less
than
a
minute
the
crowd
had
divided
into
two
close
circles
and
the
catechism
of
animal
vegetable
or
mineral
began
briskly
githa
took
no
open
notice
of
gwethyn
unexpected
championship
but
from
that
afternoon
her
attitude
changed
instead
of
continually
snapping
or
exercising
her
wit
in
sharp
little
remarks
she
was
unusually
quiet
she
would
watch
gwethyn
without
speaking
and
often
followed
her
about
the
school
though
always
at
a
short
distance
and
with
no
apparent
intention
it
was
at
this
crisis
that
gwethyn
one
morning
received
bad
news
tony
her
pekinese
spaniel
and
the
idol
of
her
heart
had
been
put
out
to
board
when
the
marsdens
left
home
his
a
respectable
working
woman
wrote
occasionally
to
record
his
progress
hitherto
her
letters
had
been
satisfactory
but
her
report
was
serious
katrine
found
gwethyn
weeping
violently
in
the
sanctum
of
their
bedroom
what
the
matter
she
asked
in
some
anxiety
matter
oh
whatever
am
i
to
do
read
this
dear
miss
marsden
i
did
not
answer
your
inquiries
before
about
the
poor
little
dog
hoping
he
might
pick
up
a
bit
but
indeed
he
frets
like
to
break
his
heart
the
children
next
door
worries
him
and
he
wo
eat
and
he
has
gone
that
thin
it
is
pitiful
to
see
him
i
do
my
best
but
he
does
not
like
being
here
he
is
getting
just
a
bag
of
bones
and
my
husband
says
it
is
nothing
but
will
you
please
tell
me
what
i
am
to
do
about
him
your
obedient
servant
mary
carter
the
darling
the
poor
darling
breaking
his
little
heart
for
his
missis
sobbed
gwethyn
i
knew
he
never
be
happy
at
the
cottage
a
bag
of
bones
oh
my
tony
katrine
have
you
got
a
penny
stamp
the
girls
at
aireyholme
were
not
supposed
to
send
letters
without
submitting
them
first
to
a
mistress
but
the
rule
was
not
very
strictly
enforced
and
gwethyn
had
no
difficulty
in
answering
by
return
of
post
what
she
said
to
carter
she
did
not
reveal
even
to
katrine
through
the
whole
of
that
day
and
the
next
she
went
about
with
a
look
of
mingled
anxiety
and
triumph
on
her
face
illustration
gwethyn
tore
off
the
silk
handkerchiefs
she
saw
at
once
what
had
happened
at
four
on
the
following
afternoon
just
when
the
girls
were
coming
from
their
classes
there
was
a
bustle
at
the
side
door
a
porter
with
a
from
the
railway
station
was
delivering
a
large
hamper
franklin
chanced
to
be
passing
at
the
moment
and
stopped
to
make
inquiries
a
hamper
for
whom
miss
marsden
and
labelled
stock
with
care
what
does
this
mean
gwethyn
coming
out
of
the
fifth
form
room
caught
sight
of
the
and
with
a
cry
of
ecstasy
made
a
rush
for
the
hamper
it
tony
my
darling
tony
oh
my
pretty
boy
where
are
you
pulling
her
penknife
from
her
pocket
she
cut
the
cords
in
a
trice
and
opening
the
lid
clutched
her
whimpering
pet
in
her
arms
a
crowd
of
girls
collected
to
see
what
was
happening
franklin
thought
it
high
time
to
interfere
gwethyn
marsden
whose
dog
is
this
she
asked
sharply
he
mine
we
left
him
at
a
cottage
when
we
shut
up
our
house
but
he
fretted
so
i
told
carter
to
send
him
here
he
wanted
his
missis
you
sent
for
this
dog
on
your
own
authority
and
without
asking
my
permission
he
was
breaking
his
heart
you
have
taken
the
most
unwarrantable
liberty
franklin
was
bridling
with
indignation
i
can
not
allow
you
to
keep
this
dog
it
must
be
sent
back
oh
no
please
please
implored
gwethyn
he
die
if
he
has
to
go
back
i
wo
let
him
be
one
scrap
of
trouble
he
sleep
on
my
bed
impossible
said
the
principal
firmly
do
you
think
i
am
going
to
relax
all
the
rules
of
the
school
in
your
favour
you
have
been
indulged
too
much
already
there
are
pupils
here
and
if
each
one
wished
to
keep
a
pet
the
place
would
be
a
menagerie
i
can
not
make
an
exception
in
your
case
it
was
most
impertinent
of
you
to
write
and
arrange
for
the
animal
to
be
sent
matters
had
reached
the
point
of
tragedy
franklin
for
once
was
really
angry
she
considered
that
the
marsdens
were
not
sufficiently
amenable
to
school
discipline
at
any
time
but
this
breach
was
beyond
all
bounds
gwethyn
hugged
tony
tightly
and
wept
stubborn
tears
then
githa
hamilton
stepped
to
the
rescue
please
franklin
instead
of
sending
the
little
dog
back
might
i
take
him
home
with
me
until
the
end
of
the
term
my
own
died
two
months
ago
and
my
uncle
said
i
could
have
another
dog
it
was
such
a
splendid
solution
of
the
difficulty
that
even
the
principal
face
cleared
gwethyn
wiped
her
eyes
and
beamed
encouragement
are
you
sure
your
uncle
and
aunt
would
consent
asked
franklin
hopefully
but
doubtfully
oh
yes
they
said
i
might
take
the
first
nice
puppy
that
was
offered
me
so
i
know
it
all
right
then
i
shall
be
very
much
obliged
if
you
will
accept
the
charge
of
this
dog
i
be
only
too
glad
githa
you
absolute
angel
murmured
gwethyn
pressing
her
treasure
into
the
toadstool
hospitable
arms
as
franklin
mollified
at
last
turned
into
the
house
angels
do
have
complexions
yes
they
do
the
nicest
sort
i
do
care
for
the
kind
at
this
moment
you
my
of
blessedness
toadstools
savour
of
elves
not
angels
githa
was
well
aware
of
her
nickname
but
look
here
i
take
good
care
of
the
little
chap
and
make
him
happy
i
smuggle
him
to
school
sometimes
so
that
you
can
see
him
i
could
shut
him
up
in
the
if
i
square
fuller
your
collie
wo
devour
him
gwethyn
asked
with
a
sudden
burst
of
anxiety
rolf
never
touches
small
dogs
he
a
gentleman
in
that
do
you
worry
tony
be
quite
safe
and
he
soon
fatten
up
with
plenty
of
milk
and
a
garden
to
run
about
in
bless
him
he
taking
to
his
new
missis
already
there
precious
one
i
want
him
back
at
the
holidays
cried
gwethyn
jealously
he
not
to
forget
me
right
you
are
hold
him
while
i
get
my
hat
and
my
bike
i
do
think
i
can
carry
him
and
ride
he
wriggle
i
have
to
wheel
my
machine
home
there
kiss
his
nose
just
once
more
and
let
him
go
chapter
viii
an
adventure
the
transference
of
tony
cemented
the
friendship
between
gwethyn
and
githa
with
such
a
precious
bond
to
unite
them
intimacy
followed
as
a
matter
of
course
on
closer
acquaintance
the
little
toadstool
proved
quite
an
interesting
companion
she
was
humorous
and
amusing
and
though
not
demonstrative
seemed
to
have
a
store
of
affection
hidden
behind
the
barrier
of
her
reserve
she
was
seldom
confidential
but
every
now
and
then
she
would
open
her
heart
the
least
little
bit
and
give
gwethyn
a
peep
at
her
real
feelings
why
did
you
take
such
a
spite
against
me
when
first
i
came
asked
the
latter
in
one
of
these
rare
moments
i
do
know
i
liked
you
and
yet
i
hated
you
i
think
it
was
because
you
and
katrine
sprung
yourselves
so
suddenly
on
me
that
morning
in
the
orchard
you
caught
me
in
my
old
pinafore
feeding
the
fowls
you
both
looked
so
smart
and
you
marched
up
so
confidently
asking
for
milk
and
evidently
taking
me
for
a
farm
girl
i
could
have
thrown
stones
at
you
i
thought
you
were
conceited
and
i
try
and
take
you
down
a
peg
you
certainly
did
your
best
you
were
absolutely
vitriolic
well
i
sorry
no
i
not
you
were
rather
conceited
at
first
you
and
katrine
thought
you
just
run
the
show
at
aireyholme
you
ever
so
much
nicer
now
do
be
offended
i
always
say
what
i
think
you
know
that
by
this
time
the
toadstool
was
certainly
apt
to
carry
the
virtue
of
frankness
beyond
all
bounds
and
to
allow
it
to
degenerate
into
a
vice
gwethyn
however
was
a
very
girl
and
instead
of
taking
offence
she
only
laughed
at
most
of
githa
remarks
and
told
her
not
to
be
a
little
wasp
in
the
circumstances
it
was
the
best
possible
treatment
people
who
are
fond
of
making
smart
and
stinging
remarks
are
always
disconcerted
if
they
fall
flat
gwethyn
toleration
made
githa
rather
ashamed
of
herself
insensibly
she
was
catching
her
new
friend
tone
the
habit
of
perpetually
sharpening
her
wit
upon
her
companions
began
to
slip
away
not
all
at
once
for
habits
are
a
strong
growth
but
by
distinctly
perceptible
degrees
even
the
girls
noticed
a
difference
spitfire
is
half
so
venomous
as
she
used
to
be
was
the
general
verdict
though
githa
might
practise
plain
speaking
where
other
people
were
concerned
she
was
extremely
reserved
on
the
subject
of
her
own
affairs
only
very
occasionally
would
she
wax
confidential
and
talk
about
her
home
life
even
then
the
scraps
of
information
seemed
to
escape
her
unwillingly
from
the
few
hints
thus
dropped
and
from
what
the
other
girls
could
tell
gwethyn
pieced
together
the
main
outline
of
her
friend
childhood
it
was
a
sad
little
story
lilac
grange
had
been
full
of
tragedy
six
years
ago
when
on
a
visit
there
githa
father
mother
and
two
elder
sisters
had
fallen
victims
to
a
virulent
outbreak
of
diphtheria
and
had
died
within
a
few
days
of
one
another
the
boy
and
girl
the
sole
survivors
of
the
family
were
adopted
by
their
grandfather
and
had
lived
with
him
at
the
grange
until
his
sudden
death
three
years
afterwards
old
ledbury
had
often
mentioned
that
he
meant
to
make
provision
for
his
two
grandchildren
but
apparently
he
had
allowed
the
months
to
slip
by
without
fulfilling
his
intention
when
his
affairs
were
investigated
the
only
will
which
could
be
discovered
was
one
dated
ten
years
back
in
which
he
left
his
entire
fortune
to
his
elder
son
wilfred
ledbury
at
that
time
he
had
quarrelled
with
his
daughter
githa
mother
but
a
reconciliation
had
followed
shortly
afterwards
and
the
hamiltons
had
stayed
at
the
grange
on
quite
friendly
terms
ledbury
had
had
another
son
frank
a
headstrong
unsettled
fellow
who
had
also
quarrelled
with
his
father
and
had
gone
away
to
america
that
frank
should
be
entirely
cut
out
of
any
inheritance
though
unjust
was
not
surprising
but
the
neighbourhood
agreed
that
to
leave
the
orphan
grandchildren
penniless
was
an
open
scandal
and
that
old
ledbury
had
failed
in
his
duty
by
neglecting
to
make
a
will
in
their
favour
people
even
whispered
sometimes
that
wilfred
ledbury
who
had
been
on
the
spot
at
the
time
of
his
father
death
had
spent
the
night
hunting
through
his
papers
and
had
probably
suppressed
any
document
that
was
not
to
his
advantage
such
stories
however
were
only
in
the
nature
of
gossip
nothing
could
be
proved
nobody
had
seen
or
witnessed
a
later
will
and
wilfred
ledbury
stepped
unchallenged
into
his
heritage
after
all
it
was
not
as
good
as
he
had
expected
a
number
of
securities
which
he
had
believed
his
father
to
possess
turned
out
to
have
been
disposed
of
beforehand
though
what
had
become
of
the
it
was
impossible
to
tell
old
ledbury
had
been
fond
of
speculating
on
the
stock
exchange
and
he
had
probably
lost
it
in
some
unlucky
venture
wilfred
thinking
the
grange
unhealthy
had
refused
to
go
and
live
there
so
the
furniture
was
sold
and
the
old
house
was
to
let
though
so
far
no
tenant
had
yet
been
found
to
take
it
wilfred
ledbury
was
a
solicitor
in
carford
and
owned
a
pretty
house
in
a
much
more
open
and
airy
situation
four
miles
beyond
heathwell
his
daughter
was
married
to
his
partner
in
the
firm
and
his
sons
were
grown
up
one
practising
at
the
bar
in
london
and
the
other
a
professor
at
cambridge
his
whole
interest
was
centred
in
his
own
children
and
their
prospects
he
had
taken
charge
of
his
nephew
and
niece
after
his
father
death
and
gave
them
a
home
and
education
but
he
let
them
feel
that
he
considered
them
an
encumbrance
the
which
he
chose
for
cedric
was
not
altogether
suitable
but
he
would
not
listen
to
the
boy
complaints
or
inquire
into
the
justice
of
his
grievances
githa
he
simply
ignored
he
paid
the
bills
for
her
schooling
and
clothes
but
took
no
notice
of
her
she
kept
out
of
his
way
as
much
as
possible
and
rarely
spoke
to
him
unless
he
asked
her
a
question
ledbury
was
not
unkind
but
did
not
care
to
be
troubled
with
her
niece
she
left
githa
almost
entirely
to
her
own
devices
except
when
her
brother
came
back
for
the
holidays
the
poor
child
led
a
lonely
life
at
her
uncle
home
she
amused
herself
mostly
out
of
doors
she
was
fond
of
animals
kept
a
few
rabbits
and
white
mice
in
a
disused
stable
and
liked
to
help
to
look
after
the
poultry
in
the
house
she
was
suppressed
and
quiet
generally
with
her
nose
buried
in
a
book
her
aunt
said
that
she
was
a
most
unresponsive
tiresome
and
unaccountable
child
with
no
sense
of
gratitude
for
all
that
was
done
for
her
the
one
person
in
the
world
whom
githa
worshipped
was
her
brother
cedric
she
lived
for
his
return
from
school
and
the
holidays
spent
with
him
were
her
landmarks
for
the
year
at
present
she
bestowed
the
wealth
of
her
surplus
affection
upon
tony
he
was
a
fascinating
little
dog
and
so
that
ledbury
offered
no
objections
to
his
temporary
adoption
she
was
really
kind
to
her
niece
in
the
matter
of
allowing
her
to
keep
pets
tony
took
to
his
new
mistress
with
an
enthusiasm
that
would
have
disgusted
gwethyn
had
she
seen
it
but
githa
was
discreet
enough
not
to
descant
too
much
upon
his
blandishments
and
keep
his
affection
as
a
delightful
secret
between
herself
and
him
i
took
you
first
of
all
to
please
gwethyn
you
precious
she
would
say
kissing
his
silky
head
but
now
you
like
my
own
and
what
do
when
i
got
to
give
you
up
i
do
know
gwethyn
ignorant
of
the
fickle
tony
lightly
transferred
allegiance
would
ask
eagerly
for
news
of
him
each
morning
she
kept
a
snapshot
of
him
on
her
and
urged
githa
to
take
the
earliest
opportunity
of
smuggling
him
to
school
for
a
day
but
githa
under
the
plea
of
the
gardener
lack
of
connivance
and
fear
of
wrath
always
managed
to
find
some
excuse
and
put
the
matter
off
to
a
future
date
the
marsdens
had
been
again
to
the
grange
with
miss
aubrey
and
had
finished
their
sketches
of
the
dovecot
it
was
a
pretty
subject
and
the
result
was
quite
successful
katrine
contemplating
her
canvas
in
the
studio
on
the
following
afternoon
was
frankly
pleased
we
both
improving
she
said
to
gwethyn
the
two
girls
had
the
room
to
themselves
for
once
i
like
miss
aubrey
style
of
teaching
immensely
it
just
what
i
wanted
she
helped
me
enormously
by
the
by
i
lost
my
best
penknife
at
the
grange
yesterday
i
must
have
dropped
it
somewhere
by
my
what
a
nuisance
but
you
have
another
not
so
good
i
do
mean
to
abandon
that
dear
little
one
will
you
come
with
me
now
and
we
go
and
look
for
it
the
grange
is
out
of
bounds
but
who
cares
certainly
i
do
franklin
rules
are
ridiculous
for
a
girl
of
my
age
surely
i
can
go
and
fetch
my
penknife
besides
we
need
go
by
the
road
if
we
climb
the
fence
in
the
orchard
we
can
cut
across
the
fields
as
the
crow
flies
and
get
into
the
lane
by
the
big
gate
of
the
grange
i
your
girl
let
toddle
off
at
once
if
any
one
croaks
i
sure
we
can
call
the
fields
within
bounds
i
not
going
to
be
bound
by
bounds
franklin
is
a
bounder
retorted
katrine
grandly
nevertheless
she
did
not
make
her
exit
over
the
orchard
fence
until
she
was
sure
no
one
was
watching
choosing
a
suitable
moment
the
girls
scaled
the
low
bars
then
skirted
round
by
the
hedge
along
the
field
till
they
were
out
of
sight
of
aireyholme
by
this
short
cut
it
was
only
a
few
minutes
walk
to
the
grange
the
old
house
seemed
more
than
ever
like
a
palace
with
an
enchanted
garden
the
lilacs
were
fading
but
the
tangle
of
greenery
had
grown
taller
and
wilder
and
even
the
very
windows
were
invaded
and
half
covered
by
long
trails
of
bindweed
and
traveller
joy
that
stretched
out
quickly
spreading
shoots
and
clinging
tendrils
and
threatened
to
bury
everything
in
a
mass
of
vegetation
how
absolutely
still
and
quiet
it
is
said
katrine
i
do
suppose
a
soul
ever
comes
near
except
ourselves
it
does
look
as
if
a
footstep
had
been
across
the
grass
for
a
long
time
why
here
my
penknife
on
the
walk
i
must
have
dropped
it
out
of
my
i
so
glad
i
found
it
it
well
we
came
this
afternoon
it
would
have
rusted
if
it
had
lain
there
much
longer
i
wonder
what
the
old
house
is
like
inside
probably
very
dark
and
damp
with
the
windows
shaded
and
unopened
it
looks
gloomy
as
if
people
had
died
there
it
is
sad
to
see
it
so
neglected
and
overgrown
one
feels
nature
has
been
too
exuberant
she
does
care
about
our
little
lives
and
tragedies
it
does
matter
to
her
what
has
been
suffered
here
she
just
pushes
that
all
to
one
side
and
forgets
and
goes
on
making
fresh
shoots
as
if
nothing
had
happened
i
think
it
kind
of
her
to
try
and
throw
a
lovely
green
veil
over
the
place
it
like
charity
covering
a
multitude
of
sins
she
doing
her
best
in
her
own
way
to
soften
down
the
tragedy
i
going
to
lift
her
veil
and
take
a
peep
inside
and
gwethyn
pulled
back
a
mass
of
succulent
briony
and
peered
through
the
dim
glass
can
you
see
anything
yes
i
can
see
a
hall
and
long
passage
it
looks
interesting
this
window
is
not
latched
i
believe
i
could
push
it
up
if
you
help
me
there
it
actually
open
the
girls
found
themselves
peering
into
a
small
room
which
was
apparently
the
vestibule
of
a
hall
the
window
was
not
placed
very
high
so
low
indeed
that
gwethyn
scrambled
without
much
difficulty
on
to
the
sill
i
going
in
she
declared
it
will
be
ever
such
fun
to
explore
i
always
wondered
what
the
inside
was
like
she
dropped
quite
easily
on
to
the
floor
within
and
gave
a
hand
to
katrine
who
was
not
slow
in
following
both
felt
it
would
be
an
adventure
to
investigate
the
interior
of
the
old
house
they
stood
still
for
a
moment
listening
but
not
a
sound
was
to
be
heard
so
they
ventured
to
go
forward
i
believe
we
have
the
place
absolutely
and
entirely
to
ourselves
unless
there
are
a
few
ghosts
flitting
about
the
passages
they
seem
more
suitable
inhabitants
than
human
beings
proclaimed
gwethyn
several
led
from
the
hall
which
by
their
decorations
proclaimed
their
use
the
one
with
the
rosewood
fittings
was
undoubtedly
the
the
larger
one
with
the
big
bow
window
could
not
fail
to
be
the
and
the
one
to
the
back
with
the
oak
panelling
must
surely
be
a
study
or
library
the
were
very
faded
and
dilapidated
and
the
paint
dingy
there
was
an
air
of
shabbiness
about
everything
the
numerous
the
cobwebs
the
odd
heaps
of
straw
and
the
thick
dust
helped
to
render
it
unattractive
and
the
general
impression
was
forlorn
in
the
extreme
i
do
wonder
nobody
takes
it
said
gwethyn
i
should
say
it
will
be
to
let
for
years
and
years
why
does
ledbury
tidy
it
up
perhaps
he
thinks
it
no
use
spending
the
money
unless
he
has
a
possible
tenant
even
if
he
papered
and
painted
it
it
would
soon
get
into
the
same
state
if
no
one
lived
here
he
might
have
a
caretaker
yes
i
wonder
he
does
i
expect
it
so
far
away
from
the
village
that
nobody
would
come
without
being
very
highly
paid
and
he
afford
that
when
he
getting
no
rent
how
large
the
place
seemed
the
girls
peeped
into
empty
room
after
empty
room
their
footsteps
echoing
in
that
strange
hollow
fashion
that
is
only
noticed
in
deserted
houses
it
gives
me
the
shivers
it
so
wretched
said
gwethyn
i
certainly
should
like
to
live
here
i
think
we
been
nearly
all
round
shall
we
go
downstairs
again
wait
there
just
this
one
passage
that
leads
somewhere
have
you
seen
enough
my
curiosity
is
insatiable
katrine
hesitated
one
room
was
exactly
like
another
it
did
not
seem
worth
while
to
explore
further
she
half
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
stairs
then
noticing
that
the
passage
was
panelled
and
thinking
that
the
room
at
the
end
might
therefore
be
older
and
quainter
than
the
rest
she
changed
her
mind
after
all
it
was
disappointing
as
bare
and
empty
as
the
others
with
torn
paper
hanging
in
strips
from
the
damp
walls
there
a
fine
view
of
the
dovecot
though
said
katrine
i
can
see
the
carving
on
the
gable
beautifully
from
here
she
flung
the
window
open
wide
the
fresh
wholesome
outside
air
came
rushing
in
the
draught
banged
the
door
and
a
sound
of
something
falling
followed
but
the
girls
were
too
occupied
to
take
any
notice
they
were
leaning
out
of
the
window
trying
to
decipher
the
date
on
the
worn
piece
of
carving
it
looks
like
opined
gwethyn
more
likely
the
tail
of
the
nine
is
cracked
away
it
older
than
the
house
at
any
rate
i
wish
i
had
my
here
and
i
have
copied
it
have
you
a
in
your
pocket
no
and
i
should
lend
it
to
you
if
i
had
we
must
be
going
at
once
or
we
shall
be
late
for
prep
katrine
consulted
her
watch
and
turned
to
the
door
then
she
gave
a
cry
of
consternation
it
was
impossible
to
open
it
the
knob
had
been
loose
and
when
the
door
banged
the
whole
handle
had
fallen
out
into
the
passage
they
were
shut
in
as
securely
as
if
by
bolt
and
bar
here
was
a
dilemma
indeed
they
looked
at
one
another
in
consternation
what
are
we
to
do
faltered
gwethyn
katrine
was
trying
to
wedge
the
handle
of
her
penknife
into
the
empty
socket
but
the
effort
was
useless
it
went
in
a
little
way
but
would
not
turn
her
attempt
to
slip
back
the
catch
with
the
blade
was
equally
futile
the
unpleasant
truth
was
hopelessly
plain
they
were
prisoners
in
the
empty
house
the
prospect
was
appalling
the
grange
was
in
such
a
secluded
spot
that
nobody
might
come
near
for
days
no
doubt
they
would
soon
be
missed
at
aireyholme
but
would
franklin
think
of
looking
for
them
here
they
shouted
and
called
out
of
the
window
but
only
the
birds
twittered
in
reply
they
were
in
the
upper
story
a
good
height
from
the
ground
and
much
too
far
to
jump
the
creepers
were
too
frail
to
offer
any
adequate
support
they
turned
to
the
door
again
and
tried
to
break
through
one
of
the
panels
but
the
wood
was
oak
and
resisted
their
kicks
and
blows
were
ever
two
girls
in
such
a
desperate
situation
the
tears
were
raining
down
gwethyn
cheeks
shall
we
have
to
stop
here
all
night
she
sobbed
i
wish
we
never
come
near
the
wretched
place
we
trapped
like
rats
in
a
cage
declared
katrine
pacing
distractedly
up
and
down
their
prison
she
paused
at
the
window
gwethyn
i
do
believe
somebody
is
in
the
garden
the
blackbirds
are
making
such
a
fuss
perhaps
it
a
cat
or
a
hawk
that
frightening
them
perhaps
but
let
us
call
in
case
it
a
human
being
even
a
burglar
would
be
welcome
we
rather
like
burglars
ourselves
said
gwethyn
her
sense
of
humour
triumphing
over
her
tears
only
there
certainly
is
anything
here
to
burgle
the
girls
leaned
from
the
window
and
shouted
with
all
the
power
of
their
lungs
then
they
waited
and
listened
anxiously
was
that
a
footstep
crunching
on
the
gravel
o
jubilate
somebody
coming
gasped
katrine
let
shout
again
oh
the
angel
it
was
freeman
sketching
paraphernalia
in
hand
who
stepped
round
the
corner
of
the
dovecot
a
guardian
angel
in
tweed
knickers
smoking
a
most
unangelic
briar
pipe
he
looked
about
to
see
whence
the
noise
proceeded
and
spying
the
girls
waved
his
hand
we
in
an
awful
fix
called
katrine
we
locked
into
this
room
will
you
please
climb
in
through
the
vestibule
window
it
open
and
let
us
out
all
right
i
be
up
in
half
a
jiff
replied
freeman
laying
his
painting
traps
on
the
dovecot
steps
in
a
few
minutes
they
could
hear
him
tramping
up
the
stairs
he
soon
picked
up
the
handle
fitted
it
in
its
socket
and
opened
the
door
he
regarded
the
girls
with
an
amused
smile
of
accusation
it
strikes
me
you
young
ladies
ought
to
be
at
school
instead
of
exploring
old
houses
on
your
own
he
ventured
in
reply
to
their
overwhelming
thanks
we
going
back
now
and
a
jolly
scrape
we
shall
get
into
if
we
not
quick
about
it
said
gwethyn
the
great
panjandrum
will
jaw
us
no
end
is
your
teacher
capable
of
scolding
rather
you
should
just
hear
her
she
does
look
it
oh
you
do
know
her
she
all
right
in
public
but
she
can
be
a
tartar
in
private
a
shade
passed
over
freeman
face
he
seemed
disappointed
oh
i
do
mean
miss
aubrey
put
in
gwethyn
quickly
she
a
darling
it
franklin
i
talking
about
she
an
absolutely
different
kind
of
person
well
i
glad
to
know
somebody
keeps
you
in
order
for
you
seem
to
need
it
laughed
freeman
have
you
heard
from
your
father
and
mother
again
we
had
a
letter
on
sunday
they
getting
on
splendidly
replied
katrine
gwethyn
we
must
bolt
illustration
the
unpleasant
truth
was
hopelessly
plain
they
were
prisoners
in
the
empty
house
with
renewed
thanks
and
a
hasty
to
their
rescuer
the
girls
made
their
exit
and
tore
back
over
the
fields
to
aireyholme
they
did
not
deserve
any
luck
but
they
managed
to
arrive
in
the
very
nick
of
time
and
walked
into
their
classrooms
just
as
the
preparation
bell
stopped
ringing
the
teachers
supposing
them
to
be
in
the
garden
had
not
noticed
their
absence
they
had
agreed
to
keep
the
adventure
to
themselves
in
case
it
should
reach
the
ears
of
the
monitresses
so
gwethyn
heroically
refrained
from
relating
her
thrilling
experience
to
rose
or
susie
she
had
learnt
by
this
time
not
to
trust
their
tongues
too
far
chapter
ix
the
tennis
championship
the
girls
at
aireyholme
did
not
go
in
for
cricket
but
concentrated
the
whole
of
their
summer
energies
upon
tennis
they
practised
constantly
and
prided
themselves
upon
their
play
dorrie
vernon
was
games
secretary
and
calculated
that
she
knew
the
exact
capabilities
of
every
girl
in
the
school
tournaments
were
the
order
of
the
term
sometimes
with
handicaps
between
different
forms
sometimes
school
versus
mistresses
for
miss
spencer
and
miss
andrews
were
good
players
and
occasionally
when
franklin
entertained
friends
a
match
was
arranged
for
visitors
versus
aireyholme
there
were
few
schools
in
the
neighbourhood
against
whom
they
could
try
their
skill
but
they
had
received
an
invitation
to
take
part
in
a
tournament
at
carford
college
and
with
franklin
sanction
proposed
to
send
two
representatives
the
choice
of
these
champions
was
a
subject
of
the
very
deepest
importance
dorrie
went
about
the
matter
in
a
thoroughly
manner
she
kept
a
tennis
notebook
and
carefully
entered
every
girl
score
day
by
day
balancing
the
totals
weekly
the
results
were
discussed
at
the
monitresses
meeting
gladwin
play
is
fearfully
off
this
term
announced
dorrie
nan
a
regular
slacker
tita
is
unequal
you
never
know
whether
she
be
brilliant
or
a
dead
failure
coralie
and
ellaline
keep
fairly
well
up
to
the
mark
hilda
has
improved
simply
immensely
our
own
record
is
satisfactory
may
i
see
the
notebook
who
has
scored
highest
altogether
asked
diana
well
katrine
marsden
by
absolute
points
admitted
dorrie
rather
unwillingly
the
three
monitresses
scanned
the
book
and
looked
somewhat
blank
it
was
an
unpalatable
truth
that
the
had
beaten
the
record
katrine
swift
serves
were
baffling
there
was
no
doubt
that
she
was
an
excellent
player
it
puts
us
in
rather
an
awkward
position
faltered
dorrie
wrinkling
her
brows
not
at
all
snapped
viola
katrine
marsden
out
of
the
running
for
a
championship
well
i
do
know
but
i
do
know
she
does
consider
herself
an
ordinary
pupil
here
only
what
she
chooses
to
call
a
boarder
therefore
she
certainly
ca
represent
the
school
that
flat
she
played
for
aireyholme
against
visitors
though
objected
diana
oh
well
that
was
different
of
course
miss
andrews
played
for
aireyholme
too
but
we
could
choose
her
for
a
champion
this
was
rather
a
convincing
argument
diana
face
cleared
she
was
always
ready
to
follow
viola
lead
we
do
want
katrine
if
we
can
help
it
she
agreed
obediently
and
yet
we
want
to
be
sporting
vacillated
dorrie
who
prided
herself
on
strictest
impartiality
and
fair
dealing
every
committee
has
to
have
its
rules
the
school
ought
to
be
represented
by
its
pupils
and
that
the
point
is
katrine
a
pupil
or
is
she
not
katrine
says
but
franklin
says
decidedly
i
think
it
beyond
argument
frowned
viola
and
after
all
captain
and
final
referee
oh
if
you
put
it
that
way
of
course
i
do
put
it
that
way
i
consider
it
only
justice
if
katrine
marsden
wo
acknowledge
herself
on
the
same
level
with
everyone
else
she
does
deserve
to
have
our
privileges
it
ca
be
all
take
and
no
give
on
her
part
there
no
need
for
us
to
be
so
very
tender
about
her
feelings
i
sure
not
the
slightest
need
echoed
diana
it
wo
do
her
any
harm
to
be
passed
over
good
for
her
in
fact
we
may
as
well
pose
as
philanthropists
while
we
about
it
twinkled
viola
suddenly
seeing
the
humour
of
the
situation
the
three
girls
laughed
all
the
same
you
only
looking
at
the
matter
from
one
side
contended
dorrie
we
got
the
credit
of
the
school
to
think
about
the
question
is
who
likely
to
score
highest
for
aireyholme
at
the
tournament
we
may
call
katrine
an
ideal
champion
but
we
must
let
ourselves
be
biased
by
private
prejudice
i
hope
i
above
such
a
low
motive
as
that
viola
answered
stiffly
no
one
could
have
the
interests
of
the
school
more
thoroughly
at
heart
than
i
for
this
very
reason
it
seems
to
me
folly
to
trust
the
championship
to
a
girl
who
really
has
much
concern
whether
aireyholme
wins
or
not
oh
surely
she
play
up
i
do
know
about
that
if
she
were
in
one
of
her
dreamy
moods
perhaps
she
would
better
not
risk
it
had
we
better
put
the
matter
to
the
vote
suggested
diana
by
all
means
i
propose
that
katrine
marsden
is
not
eligible
for
the
championship
viola
tone
was
decisive
even
slightly
aggressive
i
make
a
to
place
her
at
least
on
the
list
of
eligibles
returned
dorrie
stolidly
keeping
her
temper
diana
had
the
casting
vote
she
promptly
plumped
for
viola
partly
from
real
conviction
and
partly
because
she
was
chums
with
the
captain
so
be
it
said
dorrie
shrugging
her
shoulders
she
could
not
agree
with
the
decision
but
she
did
not
take
the
matter
much
to
heart
you
two
will
have
to
brace
up
and
practise
for
all
you
worth
we
let
carford
beat
us
when
the
result
of
the
monitresses
meeting
became
known
the
school
took
it
in
various
ways
some
girls
sympathized
with
viola
others
hotly
espoused
katrine
cause
the
affair
was
very
much
discussed
and
there
were
many
lively
arguments
over
the
justice
of
the
pronouncement
katrine
herself
accepted
it
callously
i
sure
i
do
want
to
be
champion
thanks
she
responded
to
her
sympathizers
it
would
be
an
awful
bore
to
go
and
play
carford
rather
stop
in
the
studio
and
paint
in
spite
of
her
assumed
indifference
katrine
was
rather
piqued
she
knew
her
play
was
good
and
that
it
was
mainly
jealousy
on
viola
part
which
caused
her
to
be
thus
set
aside
although
she
had
adopted
a
superior
attitude
katrine
nevertheless
rather
liked
to
shine
in
the
school
she
had
played
tennis
in
a
dilettante
fashion
before
just
to
amuse
herself
now
in
a
spirit
of
opposition
she
began
to
train
for
once
she
would
let
these
girls
see
what
she
was
capable
of
there
were
only
five
days
before
the
tournament
she
would
devote
them
to
tennis
having
arrived
at
this
decision
she
temporarily
threw
art
to
the
winds
the
studio
knew
her
presence
no
more
out
of
class
hours
the
whole
of
her
spare
time
was
given
up
to
the
courts
she
had
an
immense
advantage
over
the
monitresses
for
they
were
studying
hard
for
their
matriculation
and
had
very
little
recreation
while
she
had
a
double
portion
of
leisure
her
play
good
as
it
was
before
improved
by
leaps
and
bounds
soon
not
a
girl
in
the
school
could
compete
with
her
upon
equal
terms
and
win
her
handicaps
were
raised
continually
there
was
a
growing
feeling
that
it
was
both
unwise
and
unfair
to
exclude
her
someone
ought
to
speak
to
the
monitresses
about
it
said
jill
barton
it
would
be
precious
little
use
returned
rose
randall
viola
is
so
pigheaded
if
once
she
says
a
thing
she
stick
to
it
but
is
it
fair
that
she
should
settle
everything
well
she
captain
and
dorrie
games
secretary
they
have
the
authority
between
them
dorrie
has
been
overruled
by
viola
no
doubt
but
i
do
see
what
we
can
do
except
call
a
mass
meeting
and
appeal
um
that
rather
a
desperate
measure
i
hate
upsets
in
a
school
we
ought
all
to
pull
together
harmoniously
if
we
can
let
us
try
and
put
the
screw
on
privately
but
do
have
open
ructions
viola
is
a
decent
sort
we
do
want
to
quarrel
with
her
for
katrine
sake
most
of
the
girls
shared
jill
opinion
they
might
not
agree
with
their
captain
views
but
they
liked
her
too
well
to
proceed
to
extremities
after
all
katrine
was
a
and
viola
was
the
bulwark
of
aireyholme
traditions
they
tried
to
manage
the
matter
by
finesse
they
understood
their
leader
well
enough
to
know
that
any
alteration
must
be
proposed
by
herself
she
was
not
fond
of
entertaining
other
suggestions
so
they
forbore
to
revolt
openly
and
confined
themselves
to
desperate
hints
and
innuendoes
viola
was
perfectly
well
aware
of
what
was
going
on
and
she
ignored
the
hints
the
situation
amounted
to
a
duel
between
herself
and
katrine
and
she
trusted
to
her
influence
as
captain
to
come
off
conqueror
it
was
impossible
not
to
acknowledge
the
superiority
of
katrine
play
and
viola
really
stuck
to
her
guns
out
of
sheer
obstinacy
everybody
wondered
what
was
going
to
happen
and
whether
the
difficulty
could
be
solved
without
a
quarrel
the
time
was
painfully
short
it
was
now
the
very
day
before
the
tournament
the
question
must
be
settled
that
evening
the
results
of
the
were
posted
up
by
dorrie
on
the
notice
board
katrine
headed
the
list
by
an
overwhelming
majority
viola
followed
dorrie
was
only
a
few
points
behind
and
diana
and
hilda
bracketed
equal
came
next
if
katrine
were
ruled
out
of
competition
then
the
championship
must
fall
to
viola
and
dorrie
the
strain
waxed
acute
little
groups
of
girls
stood
about
in
the
hall
and
passages
discussing
the
pros
and
cons
it
was
evident
that
something
must
be
done
the
ferment
of
feeling
was
almost
at
effervescing
point
at
this
crisis
miss
spencer
issued
from
the
head
mistress
study
she
walked
to
the
notice
board
pinned
up
a
paper
and
marched
away
without
a
word
everyone
crowded
round
to
read
the
notice
it
was
brief
but
to
the
point
and
in
the
principal
own
handwriting
in
view
of
the
forthcoming
tournament
franklin
requests
that
the
games
committee
choose
as
champions
girls
who
are
not
entered
for
the
matriculation
no
examination
candidate
will
be
allowed
leave
of
absence
this
was
indeed
a
cutting
of
the
gordian
knot
viola
dorrie
and
diana
were
absolutely
disqualified
it
was
a
totally
unexpected
and
for
the
moment
they
were
utterly
taken
aback
as
befitted
monitresses
however
they
pulled
themselves
together
and
bore
their
disappointment
with
spartan
heroism
perhaps
they
realized
the
cleverness
of
franklin
generalship
it
was
certainly
a
safe
way
out
of
an
awkward
predicament
viola
was
an
intelligent
girl
and
had
the
sense
to
climb
down
gracefully
diana
and
dorrie
and
i
are
out
of
it
she
at
once
announced
so
i
suggest
katrine
and
hilda
as
champions
there
has
been
some
little
doubt
as
to
whether
katrine
is
eligible
to
represent
the
school
but
i
beg
to
propose
that
any
disqualifying
clause
should
be
set
aside
in
this
emergency
and
that
she
be
requested
to
play
for
aireyholme
i
sure
she
do
us
credit
all
in
favour
of
this
proposition
please
say
such
a
universal
chorus
of
assent
rose
from
the
assembled
girls
that
katrine
who
had
been
inclined
to
refuse
the
proffered
honour
was
obliged
to
accede
both
she
and
viola
had
saved
their
dignity
and
in
consequence
each
felt
a
more
friendly
disposition
towards
the
other
they
discussed
the
coming
tournament
quite
amicably
and
viola
even
offered
to
lend
her
racket
which
was
superior
to
katrine
own
hilda
was
all
smiles
with
such
a
partner
she
hoped
to
do
great
things
franklin
is
a
modern
solomon
whispered
nan
to
gladwin
katrine
was
secretly
much
gratified
at
being
chosen
champion
after
all
though
she
was
far
too
proud
to
show
it
her
affected
carelessness
however
deceived
nobody
she
as
pleased
as
punch
was
the
unanimous
verdict
of
the
school
everybody
sympathized
for
each
one
would
have
been
only
too
delighted
if
the
happy
lot
had
been
hers
the
two
champions
were
the
centres
of
congratulation
the
various
points
of
their
play
were
eagerly
discussed
they
were
the
one
topic
of
conversation
in
addition
to
the
pair
who
were
to
take
part
in
the
tournament
twelve
girls
had
been
invited
to
carford
college
as
spectators
those
whose
scores
came
next
on
the
tennis
list
were
chosen
and
gwethyn
and
rose
randall
were
among
the
lucky
number
they
were
to
be
escorted
by
miss
andrews
whose
athletic
tendencies
made
her
as
keen
as
anybody
on
the
event
fourteen
smiling
girls
stood
ready
on
the
following
morning
all
in
immaculate
white
silk
blouses
with
their
school
ties
and
hats
katrine
and
hilda
wore
rosettes
of
pink
brown
and
green
the
aireyholme
colours
to
distinguish
them
as
champions
and
most
of
the
others
sported
patriotic
badges
the
school
assembled
on
the
drive
to
see
them
off
and
they
departed
amid
a
chorus
of
good
wishes
some
of
the
juniors
even
began
to
shout
hoorays
but
franklin
suppressed
them
it
will
be
time
enough
to
cheer
if
we
win
the
tournament
she
reminded
them
remember
that
other
schools
are
competing
whose
play
may
be
better
than
ours
which
is
a
polite
way
of
saying
crow
till
you
out
of
the
wood
laughed
dorrie
to
diana
all
the
same
i
back
katrine
against
anyone
i
know
carford
college
was
a
big
situated
about
a
mile
out
of
the
town
the
aireyholme
contingent
was
received
by
the
head
mistress
and
at
once
handed
on
to
stewards
who
took
katrine
and
hilda
to
the
champions
tent
and
the
rest
to
the
seats
which
had
been
reserved
for
them
the
college
prided
itself
on
its
games
activities
its
courts
were
in
excellent
condition
and
there
was
every
facility
for
the
comfort
of
spectators
six
other
schools
besides
aireyholme
had
been
invited
to
compete
and
bring
twelve
representatives
each
to
witness
the
combat
so
that
with
the
pupils
of
the
college
there
was
a
crowd
of
more
than
two
hundred
to
watch
the
trial
of
skill
katrine
and
hilda
inside
the
tent
were
having
a
good
time
they
were
regaled
with
lemonade
and
introduced
to
the
other
champions
it
was
interesting
to
compare
notes
on
sports
and
schools
if
any
of
the
strangers
were
inclined
to
be
shy
the
ice
was
soon
broken
and
all
were
chatting
like
old
friends
by
the
time
the
tournament
began
the
college
games
captain
a
particularly
jolly
girl
made
an
admirable
hostess
and
put
all
her
guests
at
their
ease
she
had
herself
been
entertained
in
similar
circumstances
so
she
had
experience
to
guide
her
as
the
train
service
from
heathwell
to
carford
was
not
very
convenient
the
aireyholme
party
had
come
early
two
of
the
other
schools
were
in
like
case
and
the
rest
turned
up
by
degrees
at
last
all
the
competitors
had
arrived
and
the
drawing
took
place
aireyholme
was
not
in
the
first
set
rather
to
katrine
relief
i
hate
to
have
to
begin
she
remarked
to
hilda
it
much
more
helpful
if
one
can
watch
other
people
play
for
a
while
the
competitors
who
opened
the
tournament
were
fairly
evenly
matched
oakfield
house
perhaps
excelled
in
serving
but
summerlea
possessed
a
champion
who
seemed
able
to
take
every
ball
in
whatsoever
awkward
spot
it
alighted
she
was
a
short
freckled
ungainly
girl
katrine
had
mentally
noted
her
plainness
when
they
met
in
the
tent
but
her
method
of
play
was
highly
successful
and
her
side
scored
heavily
we
shall
have
our
work
cut
out
for
us
if
we
put
against
her
grunted
hilda
oakfield
did
do
badly
either
in
the
beginning
but
they
could
stand
against
this
doris
pinecroft
versus
arden
grange
came
next
on
the
list
resulting
in
a
narrow
victory
for
the
former
carford
college
had
an
exciting
tussle
with
windleness
everybody
except
of
course
the
windleness
girls
wanted
the
college
to
win
it
was
felt
that
it
would
be
too
bad
if
the
hostesses
of
the
occasion
were
out
of
the
finals
by
almost
superhuman
effort
carford
managed
to
score
but
windleness
was
accorded
full
honours
of
war
by
the
spectators
at
last
it
was
the
turn
of
katrine
and
hilda
aireyholme
had
been
drawn
to
play
ashley
hall
a
school
so
it
was
rumoured
with
a
reputation
i
horribly
nervous
i
know
we
never
beat
them
whispered
hilda
with
scarlet
cheeks
now
do
work
yourself
up
into
a
state
for
goodness
sake
keep
cool
katrine
besought
her
if
you
let
yourself
worry
you
play
badly
our
salvation
is
to
keep
our
heads
if
you
get
excited
done
for
brace
up
ca
you
i
do
my
best
murmured
hilda
setting
her
teeth
the
aireyholme
girls
had
sometimes
been
inclined
to
sneer
at
calm
imperturbable
composure
but
it
stood
the
school
in
good
stead
in
tournaments
the
cool
competitor
generally
has
an
advantage
over
an
excitable
impulsive
or
nervous
rival
the
ashley
hall
champions
were
splendid
players
but
they
were
more
brilliant
than
steady
one
or
two
little
things
put
them
out
they
lost
their
nerve
and
made
a
few
bad
strokes
katrine
on
the
contrary
kept
absolute
she
calculated
balls
to
a
nicety
and
it
was
chiefly
owing
to
her
preparedness
that
the
set
was
won
she
and
hilda
retired
with
sighs
of
relief
the
foe
was
worthy
of
their
steel
or
rather
rackets
said
gwethyn
to
rose
randall
i
glad
i
was
chosen
champion
i
never
can
keep
cool
like
kattie
she
always
the
same
never
the
least
excited
while
gyrating
all
over
the
place
like
a
lunatic
there
was
now
a
midday
interval
for
lunch
and
the
crowd
dispersed
most
of
the
college
girls
went
home
for
their
meal
but
the
visitors
from
the
other
schools
were
entertained
in
the
big
hall
with
coffee
plates
of
ham
or
tongue
buns
and
fruit
at
one
the
finals
were
to
begin
it
was
not
desirable
to
waste
too
much
time
as
several
of
the
schools
must
catch
certain
return
trains
you
played
splendidly
katrine
and
hilda
backed
you
up
no
end
declared
the
aireyholme
girls
anxious
to
congratulate
their
champions
go
on
in
that
style
and
you
do
do
expect
too
much
the
college
will
probably
win
a
love
set
when
we
play
them
returned
katrine
you
better
be
bracing
your
nerves
oh
we
sporting
enough
to
take
our
luck
as
it
comes
but
we
pin
our
faith
to
you
this
afternoon
if
the
first
sets
had
been
exciting
the
finals
were
doubly
so
summerlea
after
a
homeric
contest
vanquished
pinecroft
and
was
placed
against
aireyholme
katrine
had
anticipated
a
tussle
with
doris
kendrick
their
champion
and
she
had
calculated
correctly
doris
play
was
magnificent
and
aireyholme
only
won
by
the
skin
of
its
teeth
we
must
tackle
carford
too
whispered
katrine
to
hilda
do
give
in
now
the
excitement
among
the
spectators
was
intense
general
sympathy
was
perhaps
on
the
side
of
the
college
but
everyone
admired
plucky
play
katrine
is
commented
rose
just
look
at
that
stroke
i
never
thought
she
take
that
ball
i
believe
we
do
it
yet
well
done
hilda
good
old
girl
keep
it
up
keep
it
up
oh
i
say
ours
what
a
frolicsome
joke
the
college
girls
were
disappointed
at
the
failure
of
their
champions
but
they
were
magnanimous
enough
to
start
the
cheer
for
aireyholme
katrine
and
hilda
were
called
up
by
the
principal
to
receive
their
prizes
two
pretty
bangles
and
congratulations
poured
in
from
all
sides
there
was
not
time
for
much
more
than
to
express
their
thanks
for
miss
andrews
was
consulting
her
watch
and
announcing
that
they
must
rush
to
the
station
if
they
wished
to
catch
their
train
so
with
hasty
to
their
hostesses
they
made
their
exit
their
arrival
at
aireyholme
was
a
scene
of
triumph
franklin
was
immensely
gratified
at
the
good
news
and
the
girls
cheered
till
they
were
hoarse
we
put
it
down
in
the
school
minutes
under
the
heading
of
purred
dorrie
i
have
given
up
the
matric
to
be
there
anybody
taken
snapshots
you
rose
good
we
develop
them
and
if
they
come
out
decently
we
paste
them
in
the
school
album
i
never
thought
we
should
really
beat
carford
college
it
breaks
the
record
this
is
a
ripping
term
for
aireyholme
kattie
scored
in
more
senses
than
one
whispered
gwethyn
to
her
chum
rose
randall
chapter
x
an
antique
purchase
as
the
summer
came
on
bringing
the
climbing
roses
out
on
the
cottages
and
filling
the
village
gardens
with
a
wealth
of
flowers
artistic
soul
revelled
more
and
more
in
the
picturesque
beauty
of
heathwell
her
sketching
expeditions
were
an
intense
delight
she
was
improving
fast
under
miss
aubrey
tuition
and
also
picked
up
many
hints
from
freeman
who
would
always
stop
if
he
passed
their
easels
and
give
her
work
the
benefit
of
his
criticism
katrine
often
felt
as
if
she
were
living
in
the
past
at
heathwell
not
only
were
the
cottages
antique
but
the
people
also
had
an
atmosphere
lingering
among
them
many
of
the
women
wore
they
baked
their
bread
in
brick
ovens
made
rhubarb
wine
and
cowslip
beer
cured
their
own
bacon
and
pursued
various
homely
little
avocations
which
are
fast
going
out
of
date
in
other
parts
of
the
country
even
the
children
were
not
aggressively
advanced
some
of
them
still
bobbed
curtsies
and
wore
clean
white
pinafores
to
go
to
church
on
sundays
miss
aubrey
was
a
great
favourite
in
the
village
her
painting
brought
her
closely
into
touch
with
the
people
and
she
had
a
ready
sympathy
for
them
quite
unmixed
with
patronage
a
distinction
which
they
recognized
and
appreciated
the
patriarch
in
the
picturesque
coat
would
slowly
bring
out
his
reminiscences
during
the
hours
she
sat
sketching
him
in
his
garden
the
mothers
would
tell
her
their
troubles
and
the
children
swarmed
round
her
like
bees
it
was
an
entirely
new
phase
of
life
for
katrine
who
had
had
no
experience
before
of
our
sturdy
english
peasantry
she
saw
the
people
at
first
through
miss
aubrey
spectacles
then
she
learnt
to
like
them
on
her
own
account
and
acquired
quite
a
number
of
village
friends
the
blacksmith
who
smiled
at
her
from
his
forge
the
crippled
wife
of
the
saddler
who
waved
greetings
from
her
seat
at
the
window
the
fussy
little
spinster
in
charge
of
the
post
office
the
six
ancient
pensioners
who
generally
sat
sunning
themselves
on
the
bench
outside
the
almshouses
the
cobbler
who
bobbed
up
his
head
and
smiled
as
she
passed
his
open
doorway
the
widow
who
baked
the
brown
bread
and
the
muffins
and
the
elderly
dame
at
the
crockery
shop
there
were
many
quaint
people
in
heathwell
so
many
that
katrine
often
declared
a
list
ought
to
be
made
of
the
village
worthies
and
preserved
in
a
local
museum
there
was
linton
a
bent
old
labourer
who
supplemented
his
parish
relief
by
breaking
stones
on
the
roadside
katrine
first
made
friends
with
him
over
a
stile
it
happened
to
be
rather
a
high
and
difficult
one
and
he
was
sitting
on
the
top
of
it
so
she
paused
to
allow
him
to
descend
come
on
missie
come
on
he
cried
in
encouraging
tones
though
it
do
be
a
rare
awkward
stile
for
faymales
i
telled
parson
so
when
he
it
up
but
says
he
to
i
or
no
faymales
they
have

over
it
linton
was
a
character
in
his
way
a
antiquarian
a
nature
lover
a
dormant
poet
an
incipient
artist
and
something
of
a
philosopher
round
it
all
who
knows
what
strange
dreams
he
may
have
dreamed
in
his
youth
of
fame
to
be
won
and
songs
to
be
uttered
but
life
obligations
had
proved
too
heavy
a
burden
and
his
was
still
a
mute
inglorious
muse
his
delight
in
miss
aubrey
sketches
was
almost
pathetic
he
would
toddle
far
out
of
his
way
to
pass
her
easel
and
take
a
peep
at
the
progress
of
some
roadside
scene
or
cottage
garden
he
even
volunteered
one
evening
to
find
her
a
subject
and
to
please
him
she
and
katrine
allowed
him
to
escort
them
to
the
summit
of
a
mound
near
the
river
the
place
without
doubt
was
an
ancient
grave
for
it
was
close
to
offa
dyke
the
great
barrier
between
saxon
and
celt
and
though
from
an
artistic
point
of
view
it
was
not
paintable
the
romance
of
its
situation
was
palpable
to
miss
aubrey
and
katrine
the
true
subject
was
the
rugged
old
fellow
himself
standing
outlined
against
the
glowing
west
as
with
outstretched
hand
he
showed
where
the
slain
in
the
forgotten
had
been
heaped
and
the
earth
piled
high
above
them
his
voice
rang
as
he
tried
to
picture
the
scene
and
there
shone
from
his
eyes
just
a
gleam
of
the
divine
fire
look
around
you
he
cried
see
where
yon
river
down
and
yon
hills
back
as
they
did
a
thousand
years
agone
aye
i
often
comes
hither
and
thinks
what
a
sight
it
will
be
for
their
uprising
of
all
the
quaint
village
folk
perhaps
the
funniest
was
stubbs
who
kept
a
little
shop
at
the
corner
of
the
high
street
it
was
nominally
a
but
it
included
so
many
other
things
as
well
that
it
might
fairly
claim
to
be
a
china
store
a
bookseller
and
a
repository
of
antiquities
though
the
counter
was
spread
with
cabbages
and
cauliflowers
the
floor
was
covered
with
crockery
and
the
small
parlour
behind
was
overflowing
with
old
furniture
and
all
kinds
of
oddments
picked
up
at
auctions
chairs
mirrors
ancient
etchings
and
engravings
wedgwood
plates
toby
jugs
horn
lanterns
blunderbusses
cases
of
butterflies
clocks
medallions
pewter
dishes
and
a
vast
number
of
other
articles
stubbs
had
a
genius
for
a
bargain
she
was
a
familiar
figure
at
every
sale
in
the
district
where
she
would
bid
successfully
even
against
individuals
of
the
hebrew
persuasion
and
bear
off
her
spoils
in
triumph
she
knew
the
marketable
value
of
most
of
her
antiques
to
the
last
halfpenny
and
carried
on
a
successful
little
business
by
disposing
of
them
to
london
dealers
or
to
collectors
in
the
neighbourhood
often
at
double
the
prices
she
had
originally
paid
for
them
for
katrine
this
old
curiosity
shop
held
an
absolute
fascination
she
had
been
brought
up
to
appreciate
such
things
for
her
father
chief
hobby
was
the
collecting
of
antiques
marsden
revelled
in
carved
oak
furniture
and
worcester
china
and
had
communicated
some
of
his
enthusiasm
to
his
daughter
miss
aubrey
sympathized
with
tastes
and
would
often
allow
her
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
shop
sometimes
sending
her
there
on
small
errands
for
the
ostensible
purpose
of
ordering
peas
for
aireyholme
katrine
entered
stubbs
repository
one
memorable
afternoon
the
good
dame
had
attended
a
sale
on
the
preceding
day
and
her
small
establishment
had
received
so
many
additions
to
its
already
large
collection
that
it
was
almost
overflowing
into
the
street
she
was
superintending
the
rearrangement
of
some
of
these
articles
by
stubbs
a
individual
who
proved
a
sad
thorn
in
the
flesh
to
his
capable
better
half
and
whose
delinquencies
formed
a
topic
for
much
of
her
conversation
he
no
more
use
nor
a
babe
she
confided
indignantly
with
his
legs
that
wobbly
and
his
hand
that
shaky
i
dare
let
him
lay
a
finger
on
the
china
for
fear
he
be
dropping
it
he
took
half
a
crown
out
of
the
till
when
my
back
was
turned
and
off
he
goes
with
it
straight
to
the
well
he
was
a
article
when
i
married
him
and
i
might
known
he
were
up
to
much
if
i
had
the
experience
i
got
now
stubbs
spoke
with
warmth
evidently
regarding
her
husband
as
a
bad
investment
which
she
unfortunately
had
no
opportunity
of
passing
on
at
a
profit
to
anybody
else
she
hustled
him
out
of
the
way
at
present
and
telling
him
to
retire
to
the
kitchen
took
katrine
into
the
crowded
little
parlour
to
inspect
her
latest
purchases
the
sale
had
been
at
the
house
of
an
old
maiden
lady
who
had
possessed
many
antique
belongings
including
carved
ivories
and
miniatures
as
well
as
sheraton
furniture
these
treasures
were
of
course
far
beyond
katrine
pocket
though
she
regarded
them
with
the
covetous
eye
of
a
born
collector
i
afraid
i
ca
afford
anything
old
she
said
at
last
i
really
came
to
order
three
pecks
of
peas
for
mrs
franklin
i
a
little
cupboard
here
i
like
to
show
you
urged
stubbs
who
always
saw
in
katrine
a
possible
customer
it
went
at
the
sale
too
so
i
could
afford
to
let
you
have
it
for
one
pound
five
and
clear
a
trifle
of
profit
just
enough
to
pay
me
for
the
trouble
of
fetching
it
what
do
you
think
of
this
now
the
cupboard
in
question
was
a
small
oak
one
about
two
feet
in
height
with
the
date
carved
on
its
door
it
was
plainly
intended
for
spices
for
inside
it
had
nine
tiny
drawers
surrounding
a
space
in
the
centre
it
was
such
a
quaint
bijou
attractive
little
piece
that
katrine
promptly
fell
in
love
with
it
she
knew
it
would
absolutely
delight
her
father
and
she
determined
to
buy
it
and
give
it
to
him
as
a
birthday
present
if
you
say
a
pound
she
ventured
remembering
that
all
dealers
affect
an
almost
eastern
habit
of
bargaining
done
declared
stubbs
promptly
i
would
quarrel
with
you
over
a
few
shillings
and
i
so
stocked
up
with
things
i
be
glad
to
make
room
this
is
as
nice
a
bit
of
oak
as
you
find
in
all
heathwell
i
suppose
it
comes
from
miss
jackson
family
said
katrine
what
are
those
two
initials
carved
under
the
date
they
look
like
an
r
and
an
maybe
it
might
come
from
jackson
mother
i
did
hear
where
she
got
it
but
she
a
lot
of
fine
stuff
in
her
house
and
thought
a
deal
of
it
too
i
seen
her
at
auctions
myself
buying
a
few
odd
trifles
she
fancied
poor
dear
lady
it
sad
to
think
she
dead
and
gone
she
be
sore
upset
if
she
could
see
her
things
all
scattered
well
missie
i
send
stubbs
round
to
aireyholme
this
evening
with
the
cupboard
but
do
you
give
him
the
money
for
it
however
he
may
ask
you
call
and
pay
me
some
other
time
when
he
ai
about
he
not
fit
to
be
trusted
with
a
penny
piece
the
delinquent
stubbs
staggered
round
in
the
course
of
the
evening
bearing
the
little
oak
cupboard
in
his
arms
but
mindful
of
his
failing
katrine
forbore
even
to
give
him
a
tip
for
himself
i
felt
horribly
mean
she
assured
miss
aubrey
to
whom
she
had
confided
the
particulars
of
her
purchase
especially
as
he
hinted
so
desperately
you
were
right
for
he
would
have
gone
straight
to
the
and
spent
it
shall
we
carry
your
cupboard
into
the
studio
then
we
can
all
enjoy
it
while
it
here
oh
please
do
is
it
a
little
beauty
dad
will
be
simply
delighted
with
it
i
want
to
show
it
to
freeman
he
a
very
good
judge
of
old
oak
and
will
know
if
it
genuine
there
can
be
no
mistake
about
its
genuineness
i
think
you
are
very
lucky
to
get
hold
of
it
replied
miss
aubrey
calling
one
of
the
servants
and
telling
her
to
take
the
cupboard
upstairs
a
place
was
found
for
katrine
treasure
on
the
top
of
an
oak
chest
and
it
was
admired
to
her
heart
content
by
special
invitation
freeman
came
to
inspect
it
and
congratulated
her
on
her
possession
it
a
real
antique
a
very
pretty
little
piece
it
will
just
suit
marsden
in
the
meantime
it
an
ornament
in
the
studio
here
find
these
small
drawers
most
convenient
to
keep
paints
and
bottles
in
katrine
always
rode
her
hobbies
hard
the
acquisition
of
the
oak
had
started
her
in
a
new
line
she
now
posed
as
a
collector
of
antiques
she
borrowed
some
books
from
freeman
and
after
a
brief
study
of
their
contents
began
to
talk
glibly
of
the
sheraton
and
heppelwhite
periods
adams
and
soft
paste
worcester
china
she
aired
her
knowledge
so
ceaselessly
in
season
and
out
of
season
that
the
girls
always
ready
to
take
offence
at
her
superior
attitude
began
to
make
fun
of
her
they
chuckled
audibly
when
franklin
more
mathematical
than
artistic
made
her
calculate
the
cubic
contents
of
her
cupboard
as
a
problem
in
class
especially
as
her
answer
was
wrong
and
she
had
to
work
the
sum
again
all
sorts
of
mock
treasures
were
presented
to
her
rusty
nails
old
tins
scraps
of
leather
dug
up
from
the
garden
or
pieces
of
wood
one
morning
the
following
poetic
gem
was
left
on
her
the
authoress
was
apparently
too
modest
to
sign
her
name
so
the
lines
were
anonymous
there
was
a
collector
of
oak
she
knew
more
than
folk
on
pastes
soft
or
hard
she
hold
forth
by
the
yard
and
now
she
become
quite
a
joke
fortunately
katrine
possessed
a
sense
of
humour
that
counterbalanced
the
strain
of
priggishness
in
her
composition
she
laughed
at
the
effusion
and
took
the
hint
she
was
perhaps
conscious
that
she
had
been
putting
on
side
rather
too
vigorously
and
that
it
would
be
judicious
to
climb
down
it
viola
who
wrote
it
i
certain
she
confided
to
gwethyn
look
here
i
vote
we
play
a
joke
on
the
school
i
thought
of
something
rather
fine
the
two
girls
put
their
heads
together
and
had
a
long
confabulation
the
result
they
confided
to
nobody
but
during
the
afternoon
they
were
observed
to
be
hunting
round
the
garden
and
orchard
apparently
in
search
of
something
next
day
katrine
studied
the
carefully
and
ascertained
that
the
studio
would
be
unoccupied
by
any
classes
from
to
making
the
excuse
that
she
wished
to
touch
up
some
sketches
there
she
easily
persuaded
miss
aubrey
to
excuse
part
of
her
outdoor
work
that
afternoon
and
returning
to
aireyholme
at
three
she
secured
undisturbed
possession
of
the
room
for
half
an
hour
she
did
not
spend
the
time
in
painting
though
she
was
extremely
busy
when
the
girls
trooped
from
their
forms
at
four
they
found
a
large
and
prominent

posted
up
in
the

to

aloof
fell
victims
to
eve

of
curiosity
and
followed
the
rest
excusing
their
weakness
on
the
ground
that
as
monitresses
they
felt
obliged
to
be
present
at
all
school

and
were
thus

fulfilling

entered

declared
githa
then
drawing
gwethyn
aside
she
asked
where
did
katrine
get
that
little
cupboard
githa
had
been
away
from
school
for
a
few
days
on
the
sick
list
and
had
only
returned
that
morning
she
had
heard
the
girls
teasing
katrine
about
her
oak
treasure
but
had
not
seen
it
until
now
she
examined
it
with
much
attention
kattie
bought
it
from
stubbs
answered
gwethyn
i
believe
she
got
it
at
a
sale
a
miss
jackson
things
githa
nodded
i
know
she
died
last
month
it
used
to
be
ours

and

are
for
richard
ledbury
it
stood
on
a
table
in
the
library
at
the
grange
grandfather
had
promised
it
to
me
he
often
called
it
cupboard
i
suppose
uncle
wilfred
put
it
in
with
the
rest
of
the
things
at
the
sale
and
miss
jackson
must
have
bought
it
i
always
wondered
what
had
become
of
it
it
such
a
dear
little
cupboard
oh
i
sorry
if
we
sneaked
it
away
from
you

mind
it

your
fault

rather
katrine
had
it
than
anyone
else
i
glad
to
see
it
again
and
to
know
that
somebody
got
it
who
value
it
chapter
xi
waterloo
day
the
girls
at
aireyholme
were
nothing
if
not
patriotic
they
followed
the
course
of
national
events
with
keenest
interest
in
common
with
most
other
schools
they
had
sent
their
quota
of
knitted
garments
to
the
troops
and
they
kept
for
both
prince
of
wales
and
belgian
relief
funds
these
enterprises
were
good
as
far
as
they
went
but
not
nearly
sufficient
to
satisfy
their
martial
spirit
we
not
making
any
sacrifices
declared
viola
webster
impressively
we
do
realize
the
war
enough
we
letting
our
allies
outstrip
us
if
we
were
serbian
or

we
should
be
doing
far
more
what
sort
of
things
queried
hilda
smart
hilda
was
practical
to
a
fault
though
viola
liked
vaguely
to
generalize
oh
patriotic
things
you
know
viola
was
rather
cornered
when
it
came
to
explanations
tearing
up
our
gymnastic
costumes
for
lint
and
and
helping
to
make
bullets
and
all
the
rest
of
it
i
thought
bullets
were
made
by
machinery
at
ordnance
works
and
it
would
be
rather
silly
to
tear
up
our
gym
clothes
they
would
make
good
lint
either
well
if
not
exactly
that
we
ought
to
be
doing
something
we
have
drill
and
i
have
liked
rifle
practice
i
do
see
why
girls
should
shoot
at
my
brothers
school
they
have
a
cadet
corps
franklin
would
have
a
fit
if
she
saw
us
handling
rifles
laughed
coralie
a
girls
cadet
corps
sounds
utopian
but
we
never
get
the
powers
that
be
to
allow
it
all
the
same
interposed
diana
i
think
vi
is
right
we
not
doing
as
much
as
we
might
if
we
ca
have
a
cadet
corps
let
us
start
a
girls
patriotic
league
good
it
would
brace
us
all
up
we
plan
it
out
have
you
a
scrap
of
paper
and
a
pencil
we
call
it
aireyholme
patriotic
league
object
to
render
the
utmost
possible
service
to
our
country
in
her
hour
of
need
let
make
up
a
committee
and
fix
some
rules
best
call
a
general
meeting
of
the
whole
school
suggested
dorrie
vernon
the
kids
will
take
to
it
far
better
if
they
have
a
hand
in
it
from
the
beginning
dorrie
was
special
monitress
for
the
fourth
form
and
knew
the
mind
of
the
juniors
she
was
always
ready
to
take
their
part
and
secure
them
their
fair
share
in
what
was
going
on
viola
and
diana
were
inclined
to
use
their
prerogative
almost
to
domineering
point
but
dorrie
stood
as
representative
of
the
rights
of
the
bulk
of
the
school
after
a
short
argument
her
counsel
prevailed
and
a
general
meeting
was
announced
the
girls
responded
with
enthusiasm
everybody
turned
up
and
all
were
ready
to
join
the
new
society
discussions
were
invited
and
in
the
end
the
following
rules
were
drafted
that
this
society
be
called
the
aireyholme
girls
patriotic
league
that
its
object
is
to
render
service
to
our
country
and
her
allies
that
members
pledge
themselves
to
devote
not
less
than
half
an
hour
a
day
to
some
patriotic
duty
either
drilling
signalling
red
cross
work
sewing
or
the
making
of
articles
to
be
sold
for
the
benefit
of
our
soldiers
and
sailors
that
members
cultivate
the
qualities
of
courage
and
patience
that
each
member
agree
to
sacrifice
some
small
luxury
and
devote
the
money
thus
saved
to
the
good
of
the
cause
that
a
particular
effort
be
made
to
raise
funds
by
giving
an
entertainment
the
idea
of
making
some
special
for
the
good
of
their
country
rather
appealed
to
the
girls
each
promised
something
definite
those
who
took
sugar
in
their
tea
bound
themselves
to
give
it
up
and
ask
franklin
to
place
the
money
saved
towards
their
fund
others
agreed
to
relinquish
chocolates
the
buying
of
foreign
stamps
the
present
hobby
amongst
the
juniors
or
the
indulgence
in
various
other
little
fads
that
involved
the
outlay
of
small
sums
further
it
was
unanimously
agreed
that
franklin
should
be
asked
to
give
no
prizes
at
the
end
of
the
term
but
devote
the
money
to
patriotic
causes
viola
who
loved
dramatic
scenes
made
all
with
uplifted
hand
take
a
solemn
pledge
to
keep
the
rules
she
exhibited
a
specimen
badge
which
she
had
designed
the
initials
worked
in
red
on
a
piece
of
white
ribbon
and
urged
each
member
to
copy
it
as
speedily
as
possible
having
thus
discussed
broad
details
she
went
on
to
particulars
we
must
get
up
some
kind
of
a
bazaar
or
entertainment
to
make
money
she
proposed
who
can
give
suggestions
oh
do
all
speak
at
once
please
it
no
use
all
jabbering
together
silence
am
i
chairman
or
not
anybody
with
a
genuine
and
helpful
idea
kindly
hold
up
her
hand
the
rest
keep
quiet
yes
gwethyn
marsden
what
have
you
to
say
stand
up
please
i
beg
to
suggest
that
june
is
the
centenary
of
the
battle
of
waterloo
and
that
we
ought
to
give
our
entertainment
on
that
day
a
thrill
passed
round
the
room
gwethyn
sat
down
covered
with
glory
everybody
felt
that
her
idea
was
most
appropriate
it
would
be
glorious
hesitated
viola
but
how
about
the
the
exam
begins
on
june
and
lasts
four
days
why
we
should
just
be
free
for
the
of
course
it
gives
us
a
very
short
time
to
make
arrangements
and
diana
and
dorrie
and
i
shall
be
too
busy
to
help
with
anything
until
our
ordeal
is
over
never
mind
the
others
must
do
the
work
waterloo
day
would
be
just
prime
declared
dorrie
hugely
taken
with
the
notion
we
write
and
get
our
home
folks
to
send
us
things
we
can
have
stalls
and
sell
fancy
articles
and
give
entertainments
as
well
it
will
be
ripping
fun
we
have
asked
mother
franklin
yet
objected
diana
oh
she
agree
do
you
alarm
yourself
she
as
keen
on
the
soldiers
and
sailors
as
we
are
it
her
saving
virtue
the
mother
of
the
gracchi
wo
refuse
you
bet
the
principal
when
approached
on
the
subject
gave
a
cordial
assent
but
only
on
the
understanding
that
the
new
undertaking
should
not
interfere
with
the
matriculation
studies
of
the
three
monitresses
they
might
help
when
their
examination
was
over
but
not
before
she
approved
of
the
league
and
its
objects
promised
to
devote
both
sugar
money
and
prize
money
to
the
funds
and
set
apart
waterloo
day
for
a
special
entertainment
to
which
the
neighbourhood
should
be
invited
she
moreover
graciously
consented
to
act
as
president
of
the
society
and
accepted
a
badge
in
token
of
membership
the
set
to
work
with
enthusiasm
scarcely
more
than
a
fortnight
was
at
their
disposal
for
preparations
so
it
behoved
them
to
waste
no
time
urgent
letters
were
dispatched
home
begging
for
suitable
things
to
furnish
the
stalls
and
to
provide
costumes
for
the
entertainment
while
all
available
recreation
was
spent
in
the
fabrication
of
such
articles
as
they
could
make
at
school
an
extra
spur
was
given
to
their
patriotic
ardour
by
stirring
news
which
franklin
with
shining
eyes
announced
one
morning
her
son
at
the
front
had
performed
a
splendid
and
heroic
deed
in
guarding
an
outpost
against
almost
overwhelming
odds
his
brave
action
was
recorded
in
the
newspapers
which
also
published
his
portrait
and
a
brief
account
of
his
career
he
was
practically
sure
to
receive
the
victoria
cross
poor
franklin
could
not
restrain
her
pride
in
her
though
there
was
anxiety
mixed
with
the
triumph
for
he
was
lying
wounded
in
a
french
hospital
as
the
result
of
his
gallantry
she
cut
the
account
from
the
newspaper
and
pinned
it
on
the
school
notice
board
for
the
girls
to
read
and
did
not
check
them
when
they
raised
noisy
cheers
on
behalf
of
the
hero
i
wish
we
knew
where
hereward
is
sighed
katrine
to
gwethyn
fearfully
tantalizing
just
to
be
told
that
his
regiment
is
moved
and
not
a
hint
allowed
as
to
where
it
going
i
sure
he
win
a
victoria
cross
too
before
the
war
is
over
would
mumsie
be
proud
she
be
ready
to
worship
him
agreed
gwethyn
the
marsdens
heard
from
their
parents
as
frequently
as
circumstances
allowed
they
looked
forward
immensely
to
mail
days
and
devoured
the
long
letters
that
arrived
full
of
descriptions
of
the
doings
of
the
conference
at
sydney
where
professor
marsden
was
winning
laurels
by
his
lectures
on
geology
and
antediluvian
mammalia
mumsie
gave
bright
accounts
also
of
her
adventures
in
australian
society
and
of
various
excursions
to
see
the
sights
of
the
country
she
spoke
warmly
of
the
hospitality
that
had
been
accorded
them
and
the
agreeable
impression
they
had
formed
of
the
colony
the
girls
in
return
had
plenty
of
school
doings
to
relate
katrine
waxed
enthusiastic
over
her
sketching
experiences
and
gwethyn
described
her
chums
and
descanted
on
the
fun
enjoyed
by
her
form
both
acknowledged
that
they
were
happy
at
aireyholme
and
that
the
term
was
passing
very
much
faster
and
more
pleasantly
than
they
had
anticipated
it
was
of
course
impossible
for
the
marsdens
to
ask
their
mother
to
send
gifts
for
their
patriotic
bazaar
the
whole
affair
would
be
over
before
the
letter
could
reach
australia
but
they
wrote
to
various
aunts
and
cousins
and
pleaded
their
cause
so
well
that
they
had
quite
a
nice
little
collection
of
articles
to
offer
as
their
contribution
everybody
at
school
was
working
as
well
as
begging
from
friends
and
relations
all
kinds
of
dainty
trifles
were
fabricated
by
willing
fingers
and
the
entertainment
guild
seemed
to
be
practising
incessantly
miss
aubrey
was
a
great
help
in
planning
and
arranging
costumes
and
katrine
even
boldly
tackled
freeman
and
persuaded
him
to
paint
a
scene
background
to
be
used
for
the
tableaux
a
few
of
the
village
youngsters
were
requisitioned
to
take
parts
which
needed
child
actors
for
none
of
the
aireyholme
girls
were
under
twelve
and
even
the
youngest
in
the
fourth
had
reached
a
leggy
and
lanky
stage
quite
impossible
for
the
infantine
rôles
that
were
required
there
was
no
lack
of
volunteers
from
the
council
school
the
picturesque
little
gartleys
were
delighted
to
be
chosen
and
such
keen
rivalry
was
shown
among
the
other
cherubs
to
secure
the
honour
of
helping
in
the
entertainment
that
miss
aubrey
found
it
difficult
not
to
include
the
whole
of
the
infant
standard
invitations
were
sent
to
everybody
in
the
neighbourhood
who
was
likely
to
come
a
poster
was
nailed
up
outside
the
market
hall
and
another
by
the
church
so
that
all
the
village
might
know
what
was
happening
they
were
designed
by
freeman
and
executed
by
katrine
with
a
little
assistance
from
nan
and
gladwin
and
very
temptingly
set
forth
the
attractions
of
the
bazaar
it
was
a
great
scramble
to
get
everything
finished
in
so
short
a
time
and
miss
aubrey
and
the
other
mistresses
bore
the
brunt
of
the
burden
of
the
arrangements
thanks
to
their
energy
and
clever
management
there
were
no
hitches
and
the
goods
for
sale
and
the
entertainments
were
in
equal
readiness
when
the
great
day
came
on
the
monday
tuesday
wednesday
and
thursday
viola
diana
and
dorrie
had
attended
the
local
centre
at
carford
to
take
their
matriculation
examination
their
ordeal
being
over
they
were
able
with
free
minds
to
devote
their
energies
to
the
league
franklin
was
not
particularly
fond
of
remitting
classes
but
she
had
the
wisdom
to
grant
a
whole
holiday
for
the
occasion
perhaps
she
realized
that
it
would
be
futile
to
attempt
to
set
her
pupils
to
work
in
the
morning
when
so
much
was
to
happen
in
the
afternoon
i
could
have
tackled
one
single
problem
averred
rose
randall
it
would
have
been
cruelty
to
animals
to
expect
us
to
do
maths
besides
we
got
to
set
out
our
stalls
and
that
no
end
of
a
business
take
hours
i
glad
we
french
i
think
our
costumes
are
much
the
prettiest
the
stalls
were
to
represent
various
nations
they
were
lavishly
decorated
with
flags
and
upon
them
were
displayed
goods
representative
of
the
countries
of
the
allies
the
sixth
had
chosen
the
british
empire
and
had
an
assortment
of
all
kinds
of
articles
of
a
patriotic
description
photos
of
lord
kitchener
general
french
and
admiral
jellicoe
were
of
course
largely
to
the
fore
and
as
memorials
of
the
waterloo
centenary
portraits
of
wellington
and
of
napoleon
also
figured
on
the
stalls
with
picture
post
cards
of
the
famous
it
was
astonishing
how
many
purposes
the
union
jack
was
made
to
serve
its
familiar
red
white
and
blue
stripes
were
reproduced
on
bradshaw
covers
nightdress
cases
blotters
handkerchief
sachets
and
toilet
tidies
the
shamrock
also
was
a
favourite
design
and
the
red
dragon
of
wales
and
the
scotch
thistle
had
been
attempted
coralie
aunt
had
sent
a
few
indian
contributions
bought
from
the
eastern
department
at
the
stores
and
ellaline
dickens
had
managed
to
procure
a
number
of
post
cards
of
egypt
to
help
to
represent
the
empire
perhaps
the
most
striking
feature
of
the
stall
was
an
exhibit
which
was
not
for
sale
colonel
harvey
an
elderly
gentleman
who
lived
within
a
few
miles
of
heathwell
had
lent
some
swords
and
bullets
taken
from
the
battle
of
waterloo
where
his
had
commanded
a
regiment
i
am
afraid
the
girls
giggled
a
little
as
they
arranged
them
on
the
stall
for
it
reminded
them
of
katrine
mock
exhibition
these
however
were
genuine
and
certified
antiques
of
whose
authenticity
there
could
be
no
possibility
of
doubt
the
stallholders
were
dressed
to
represent
various
typical
members
of
the
empire
britannia
with
helmet
and
trident
stood
for
england
and
was
impersonated
by
diana
bennett
gladwin
riley
made
a
sweet
irish
colleen
tita
gray
wore
the
scotch
plaid
and
nan
bethell
the
tall
welsh
hat
viola
webster
was
a
hindu
zenana
princess
and
coralie
nelson
a
canadian
squaw
the
french
stall
run
by
the
fifth
was
an
equal
success
the
girls
had
chosen
to
wear
the
picturesque
breton
costume
and
looked
charming
in
their
velvet
bodices
white
sleeves
and
quaint
caps
it
had
been
most
difficult
to
provide
articles
that
were
specially
french
so
they
had
fallen
back
mainly
on
refreshments
and
sold
numerous
dainty
cakes
and
sweetmeats
and
cups
of
au
yvonne
and
mélanie
de
broeck
the
two
little
belgian
refugees
who
were
being
educated
at
aireyholme
were
naturally
much
in
request
on
this
occasion
and
chattered
french
to
the
guests
very
winningly
but
perhaps
the
prettiest
of
all
was
the
fourth
form
stall
which
was
intended
to
depict
a
scene
in
old
japan
coloured
lanterns
were
hung
up
and
branches
of
fir
and
clumps
of
lovely
iris
were
carefully
arranged
in
artistic
japanese
fashion
a
number
of
cheap
and
tasteful
articles
had
been
procured
from
the
stores
tiny
cabinets
cups
and
saucers
teapots
vases
lacquered
goods
paper
kites
native
dolls
and
queer
little
books
all
of
which
found
a
ready
sale
six
brunette
members
of
the
form
were
attired
in
geisha
costumes
and
made
quite
creditable
little
oriental
ladies
with
their
dark
tresses
twisted
into
smooth
knots
and
their
eyebrows
painted
to
give
them
the
required
slant
they
sold
fruit
and
flowers
in
addition
to
their
other
wares
and
waxed
so
persuasive
that
their
stall
began
to
be
cleared
the
earliest
of
the
three
rather
to
the
envy
of
france
and
the
british
empire
who
had
not
expected
the
juniors
to
do
so
well
in
addition
to
providing
a
stall
each
form
gave
a
special
entertainment
for
which
a
separate
admission
was
charged
the
sixth
made
great
capital
with
patriotic
songs
drake
drum
your
king
and
country
want
you
the
motherland
and
o
england
happy
england
were
received
with
much
applause
and
all
the
audience
joined
in
the
chorus
to
tipperary
a
very
pretty
picture
accompanied
the
song
in
a
child
small
hand
wee
ruth
and
rose
gartley
dressed
in
the
greenaway
costumes
they
had
worn
on
may
day
and
looking
sublimely
cherubic
stood
holding
out
their
fat
little
fingers
while
ellaline
sang
in
a
child
small
hand
lies
the
fate
of
our
land
it
is
hers
to
mar
or
save
for
a
sweet
child
sure
grows
a
woman
pure
to
make
men
good
and
brave
we
english
shall
kiss
the
rod
come
our
foes
on
land
or
sea
if
our
children
be
true
to
themselves
and
to
god
oh
great
shall
our
england
be
special
emphasis
was
laid
in
the
entertainment
on
the
fact
that
it
was
waterloo
day
hilda
smart
in
a
white
dress
of
the
fashion
of
recited
byron
famous
lines
there
was
a
sound
of
revelry
by
night
and
nan
bethell
gave
napoleon
at
helena
and
nelson
motto
some
pretty
english
scotch
irish

the

the

by

their
french

had
been
prepared
with
equal
care
they
commenced
appropriately
by
singing
the
marseillaise
yvonne

mélanie
were
placed
in
prominent
positions
in
the
front
holding
the
belgian
flag
and
followed
with
la
brabançonne
in
english
as
a
duet
it
was
rather
an
affecting
performance
as
the
two
little
refugees
sang
in
their
pretty
foreign
accent
the

by

a

of

famous

based
upon

the

the
fourth
form
entertainment
was
of
a
different
type
a
japanese
festival
was
represented
and
most
pretty
it
proved
to
be
a
number
of
tiny
village
children
were
dressed
as
japanese
dolls
and
posed
as
in
a
toy
shop
but
to
the
great
delight
of
the
audience
the
dolls
suddenly
came
to
life
stood
up
and
played
a
japanese
game
very
charmingly
and
other
appropriate
songs
were
sung
and
a
patriotic
touch
was
given
to
the
affair
by
the
inclusion
of
some
russian
peasant
dances
and
the
russian
national
anthem

the

was
a

the

and
the
villagers
came
in
full
force
and
sixpences
literally
poured

chapter
xii
katrine
ambition
katrine
undoubtedly
had
a
very
decided
vocation
for
art
she
was
full
of
enthusiasm
and
ready
for
any
amount
of
hard
work
in
connection
with
this
her
favourite
study
moreover
she
was
ambitious
in
secret
she
cherished
a
very
precious
dream
she
did
not
dare
to
confide
it
to
anybody
not
even
to
gwethyn
but
she
thought
about
it
constantly
in
private
her
scheme
was
no
other
than
to
get
a
picture
into
some
public
exhibition
the
royal
academy
she
realized
was
beyond
her
also
it
was
at
present
open
so
that
there
could
be
no
chance
of
competing
for
it
until
march
in
the
following
year
when
you
are
seventeen
eight
months
seem
an
eternity
it
was
impossible
to
wait
so
long
before
trying
to
place
her
work
in
the
public
gaze
she
knew
that
autumn
exhibitions
were
held
in
some
of
the
large
provincial
cities
freeman
was
at
present
busy
with
pictures
destined
for
these
galleries
and
miss
aubrey
also
was
a
member
of
several
art
societies
which
had
held
local
shows
katrine
idea
was
to
try
and
paint
a
really
good
sketch
then
to
have
it
framed
and
entreat
freeman
to
allow
it
to
be
dispatched
with
his
pictures
when
he
sent
them
to
the
liverpool
exhibition
of
course
it
might
not
get
in
the
hanging
committee
would
very
possibly
reject
it
but
there
was
always
the
chance
of
its
acceptance
and
surely
there
could
be
no
harm
in
trying
her
luck
to
have
a
picture
in
a
public
exhibition
would
place
her
entirely
above
the
level
of
schoolgirl
and
raise
her
to
the
delightful
rank
of
artist
in
imagination
she
saw
her
picture
already
hung
not
skied
but
in
an
excellent
position
on
the
line
perhaps
even
with
a
red
star
in
one
corner
that
summit
of
artists
hopes
to
mark
it
as
sold
how
delightful
to
go
to
the
gallery
and
see
it
for
herself
how
she
would
revel
in
the
catalogue
in
which
her
name
would
be
printed
as
an
exhibitor
she
would
certainly
turn
up
her
hair
for
the
occasion
it
would
be
ridiculous
to
wear
it
in
a
plait
but
before
these
golden
visions
had
any
chance
of
realization
she
must
produce
her
masterpiece
she
did
not
think
freeman
would
countenance
submitting
any
of
her
present
sketches
to
a
hanging
committee
his
criticisms
of
them
though
kindly
had
not
spared
their
faults
a
really
good
subject
was
half
the
battle
of
a
picture
in
her
estimation
so
she
turned
over
many
ideas
in
her
mind
one
day
she
had
an
inspiration
miss
aubrey
had
engaged
as
a
model
an
old
village
woman
who
came
three
days
in
the
week
to
sit
in
the
studio
she
was
a
picturesque
figure
in
lilac
cotton
dress
white
apron
and
and
miss
aubrey
posed
her
with
katrine
own
cupboard
as
an
accessory
katrine
notion
was
to
complete
the
picture
by
the
addition
of
a
child
holding
outstretched
hands
as
if
to
ask
granny
blundell
for
something
from
the
cupboard
little
hugh
gartley
was
the
very
one
his
flaxen
curls
would
look
lovely
against
a
background
of
old
oak
moreover
he
was
the
school
mascot
twice
before
his
portraits
had
secured
luck
to
their
fortunate
painters
why
not
a
third
time
in
anticipation
her
name
was
already
in
the
catalogue
she
thought
of
several
appropriate
titles
please
granny
grandmother
cupboard
i
want
some
and
i
a
good
boy
but
could
not
decide
which
she
liked
the
best
she
easily
persuaded
miss
aubrey
to
allow
her
to
have
hugh
as
a
model
and
the
little
fellow
came
for
a
short
time
every
day
after
his
to
stand
for
his
portrait
katrine
took
an
immense
amount
of
pains
over
her
sketch
it
was
decidedly
the
best
she
had
done
and
miss
aubrey
commended
it
the
thing
it
chiefly
wants
is
a
really
suitable
background
said
katrine
i
ought
to
paint
a
cottage
interior
with
a
little
window
and
a
flowerpot
on
the
sill
may
i
take
my
sketch
to
the
gartleys
cottage
and
finish
it
there
certainly
if
you
like
i
ca
go
with
you
for
there
would
be
room
for
two
easels
but
you
will
be
all
right
there
alone
gwethyn
laughed
when
katrine
announced
her
intention
i
do
envy
you
painting
in
the
midst
of
a
close
circle
of
gartleys
she
said
never
mind
i
shall
have
to
stand
it
one
must
pay
the
price
for
efforts
perhaps
the
mother
will
keep
them
in
order
put
on
your
oldest
skirt
then
for
they
smear
sticky
fingers
over
it
are
seven
is
a
nice
sentiment
in
a
poem
but
one
prefers
a
lesser
number
in
a
cottage
especially
when
the
family
is
so
addicted
to
treacle
i
call
you
a
martyr
to
the
cause
of
art
i
like
the
dilapidated
picturesque
exteriors
but
i
draw
the
line
at
sitting
inside
some
of
them
that
where
your
enthusiasm
falls
short
of
mine
yes
i
should
want
the
gartley
residence
first
but
tastes
differ
you
can
always
overlook
every
inconvenience
for
the
sake
of
the
picturesque
so
go
and
my
blessing
go
with
you
do
rag
murmured
katrine
it
not
so
bad
as
all
that
when
katrine
arrived
at
the
cottage
and
proffered
her
request
to
gartley
to
be
allowed
to
make
a
sketch
of
the
kitchen
she
thought
just
a
shade
of
doubt
passed
over
the
face
and
that
the
assent
though
ready
enough
was
not
quite
so
cordial
as
she
had
expected
she
saw
the
explanation
of
the
woman
hesitation
at
once
when
she
entered
seated
by
the
fireside
with
his
boots
on
the
fender
and
a
clay
pipe
in
his
mouth
was
a
individual
whom
she
had
no
difficulty
in
guessing
to
be
bob
gartley
though
she
had
never
chanced
to
come
across
him
before
you
wo
mind
he
said
gartley
apologetically
under
her
breath
he
biding
at
home
instead
of
at
his
work
it
a
poor
place
for
you
to
sit
but
i
try
and
keep
the
children
off
you
hugh
oh
yes
he
stand
if
you
want
him
go
and
fetch
him
mary
get
away
tom
would
you
like
a
chair
miss
i
brought
my
thank
you
replied
katrine
unpacking
her
sketching
materials
and
placing
her
canvas
upon
her
easel
you
see
i
already
put
hugh
into
the
picture
i
only
want
to
finish
him
off
and
paint
a
background
why
there
he
be
to
the
life
and
if
it
is
old
blundell
too
oh
is
it
beautiful
might
bob
take
a
look
bob
come
and
see
how
nice
the
lady
painted
our
hugh
bob
heaved
himself
up
rather
diffidently
and
approached
the
easel
he
was
apparently
modest
at
receiving
visitors
he
stared
hard
at
the
canvas
bending
down
indeed
to
examine
it
more
closely
katrine
thought
he
was
mentally
appraising
the
portrait
of
his
child
but
when
at
last
he
spoke
his
criticism
was
totally
unexpected
where
did
you
get
yon
cupboard
he
grunted
this
little
spice
cupboard
in
the
picture
why
i
bought
it
from
mrs
stubbs
you
bought
it
off
stubbs
how
did
she
come
to
get
hold
of
it
now
i
believe
she
got
it
at
a
sale
and
you
drawed
it
just
as
it
is
you
have
made
up
they
letters
and
figures
and
things
as
is
on
it
oh
no
i
copied
them
exactly
and
where
is
it
now
i
have
it
safely
at
aireyholme
in
the
studio
what
do
you
want
to
know
for
bob
interposed
his
wife
never
you
mind
it
no
business
of
yours
nor
of
anyone
else
so
far
as
i
can
see
hugh
oh
yes
it
like
enough
to
the
brat
i
dare
say
they
a
noisy
set
all
on
and
without
vouchsafing
any
further
information
the
head
of
the
gartley
family
stumped
out
of
the
cottage
in
the
direction
of
the
dragon
well
it
the
first
time
as
ever
i
known
bob
take
so
much
notice
of
anything
exclaimed
gartley
what
he
got
to
do
with
cupboards
perhaps
he
fond
of
old
furniture
ventured
katrine
him
he
fond
of
his
pipe
and
his
beer
and
that
all
i
like
to
know
what
be
up
why
i
suppose
anyone
can
feel
a
little
natural
curiosity
when
he
looks
at
a
picture
said
katrine
who
saw
nothing
unusual
in
the
incident
natural
curiosity
indeed
he
a
deep
is
bob
well
perhaps
he
tell
you
at
not
he
he
do
tell
me
naught
but
there
what
the
use
of
talking
of
him
a
young
lady
like
you
wo
want
to
be
thinking
of
such
as
he
probably
gartley
was
right
katrine
went
on
with
her
sketch
and
forgot
all
about
bob
and
his
temporary
burst
of
inquisitiveness
she
painted
the
little
window
and
the
pots
of
geraniums
and
a
part
of
the
doorway
with
a
peep
of
the
village
street
showing
through
the
open
door
it
was
exactly
the
background
she
wanted
for
her
figures
the
whole
made
quite
a
charming
picture
at
four
she
packed
up
her
traps
and
went
back
to
school
rather
reluctantly
for
she
had
spent
a
pleasant
afternoon
it
was
not
until
after
she
had
gone
that
bob
gartley
sauntered
back
from
the
dragon
to
join
his
family
circle
by
occupation
he
was
a
farm
labourer
a
blacksmith
assistant
a
bricklayer
or
a
carter
as
the
case
might
be
but
he
never
stuck
long
to
any
job
owing
to
the
exertions
of
his
wife
and
his
numerous
olive
branches
at
haymaking
or
in
the
harvest
field
he
generally
managed
to
get
through
the
summer
without
any
undue
expenditure
of
energy
on
his
own
part
a
state
of
affairs
which
he
regarded
as
highly
satisfactory
let
the
kids
work
he
remarked
on
this
particular
evening
after
pocketing
the
sixpence
which
katrine
had
left
for
hugh
it
good
for
develops
their
muscles
and
teaches
punctuality
and
perseverance
and
order
and
all
they
things
the
parish
magazine
says
ought
to
be
instilled
into
while
they
are
young
i
was
set
at
it
soon
enough
myself
and
clouted
on
the
head
if
i
did
keep
it
up
i
do
hold
with
these
council
schools
keeping
the
children
shut
up
for
the
best
part
of
the
day
when
they
ought
to
be
a
bit
of
use
in
the
fields
at
a
job
of
weeding
or
i
suppose
they
must
get
their
schooling
mary
is
learning
to
recite
shakespeare
and
she
can
do
vulgar
fractions
so
she
tells
me
replied
gartley
who
was
proud
of
her
talents
shakespeare
and
vulgar
fractions
is
all
very
well
but
they
do
earn
nothing
did
i
take
first
prize
myself
for
reciting
when
i
were
a
boy
at
school
and
much
good
it
done
me
no
if
i
a
voice
in
public
affairs
i
drop
education
and
spend
the
money
on
giving
allotments
to
decent
working
men
with
big
families
men
who
train
their
kids
not
to
be
idle
and
keep
at
it
what
the
use
of
sendin
a
child
to
school
for
a
matter
of
nine
years
to
cram
it
with
when
goin
to
get
its
livin
with
its
hands
afterwards
let
it
stop
at
home
says
i
and
copy
its
father
a
nice
example
you
make
for
sure
sneered
gartley
you
only
want
at
home
so
that
you
can
have
some
to
send
errands
why
if
there
is
stubbs
at
the
door
whatever
she
come
for
i
like
to
know
though
she
might
not
feel
undue
delight
at
the
advent
of
a
visitor
gartley
nevertheless
hastened
to
admit
the
vendor
and
usher
her
into
the
kitchen
most
poor
people
are
very
much
afraid
of
giving
one
another
offence
and
suffer
greatly
from
the
intrusions
of
their
neighbours
it
is
impossible
to
say
not
at
home
when
they
must
answer
the
door
in
person
and
the
plea
of
being
busy
would
be
regarded
as
a
mere
excuse
bob
gartley
did
not
rise
to
greet
the
neither
did
he
remove
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
but
stubbs
was
unaccustomed
to
be
treated
with
ceremony
so
she
did
not
notice
such
trifling
omissions
i
came
to
see
if
you
could
spare
half
a
day
to
help
me
with
some
cleaning
jane
she
announced
i
had
a
fresh
lot
of
furniture
in
last
week
and
it
do
be
in
such
a
state
i
must
tidy
it
up
a
bit
before
i
let
folks
look
at
it
there
a
gentleman
wrote
to
me
from
london
about
it
a
dealer
in
a
big
way
he
is
and
he
may
come
down
any
day
so
i
want
it
to
have
a
rub
with
the
you
do
a
nice
little
bit
of
business
in
your
line
stubbs
remarked
bob
gartley
and
a
pretty
quick
turnover
too
from
what
i
hear
well
things
be
just
tolerable
like
sometimes
i
make
a
profit
and
sometimes
i
do
admitted
stubbs
cautiously
it
takes
knowing
does
the
buying
of
old
furniture
but
i
may
say
i
got
a
reputation
for
spotting
what
genuine
all
the
best
people
about
comes
to
me
for
things
i
had
everard
and
captain
and
gordon
and
jefferson
and
even
sir
victor
white
his
own
self
bless
me
ca
they
afford
to
buy
their
furniture
new
exclaimed
gartley
in
much
astonishment
that
shows
you
do
know
anything
about
it
jane
gentlefolks
has
a
great
liking
for
old
things
and
will
pay
almost
any
fancy
price
for
no
i
do
mean
plain
deal
tables
and
chairs
like
these
intercepting
bob
hopeful
glance
at
his
property
but
oak
dressers
and
chests
and
cupboards
that
have
come
down
through
a
generation
or
two
well
it
a
queer
taste
if
i
was
a
lady
i
go
into
carford
and
get
a
velvet
sofa
and
a
sideboard
with
glass
at
the
back
of
it
ah
that
not
the
present
fashion
said
stubbs
shaking
her
head
wisely
you
be
amazed
how
everybody
has
took
a
craze
for
what
old
the
young
ladies
at
aireyholme
is
always
in
and
out
of
my
shop
at
bits
of
china
and
samplers
and
did
one
of
buy
a
cupboard
of
you
a
while
ago
inquired
bob
so
she
did
but
i
do
know
how
you
come
to
hear
of
it
i
seed
it
in
a
picture
she
were
making
of
our
hugh
and
she
put
in
granny
blundell
as
well
added
gartley
i
remember
the
cupboard
well
enough
said
stubbs
i
was
sorry
afterwards
i
let
her
have
it
for
i
could
have
sold
it
for
ten
shillings
more
to
someone
who
came
in
the
very
next
day
where
did
you
get
it
at
miss
jackson
sale
had
it
always
been
at
the
elms
no
i
remember
miss
jackson
buying
it
about
three
years
ago
when
there
was
that
sale
at
the
grange
i
a
fancy
for
it
myself
then
but
she
outbid
me
so
i
was
quite
pleased
to
get
hold
of
it
in
the
end
i
reckon
it
belonged
to
old
ledbury
then
no
doubt
though
i
ca
say
where
he
got
it
from
what
do
you
want
to
know
for
i
do
want
to
know
it
no
business
of
mine
katrine
sketch
was
greatly
admired
by
the
girls
at
aireyholme
but
miss
aubrey
in
her
capacity
of
art
teacher
criticized
it
sternly
to
rectify
the
faults
thus
pointed
out
katrine
toiled
very
hard
and
completely
repainted
the
two
figures
granny
blundell
was
a
patient
model
and
as
the
sittings
resulted
in
shillings
expressed
her
willingness
to
pose
any
time
for
the
school
several
of
the
other
girls
sketched
her
at
the
life
class
though
none
of
their
efforts
were
as
successful
as
katrine
noticing
the
old
woman
interest
in
the
progress
of
the
portrait
gwethyn
made
her
a
present
of
the
she
had
just
finished
her
gift
was
hardly
as
well
received
as
she
had
anticipated
the
old
body
scarcely
said
you
complained
gwethyn
much
aggrieved
perhaps
she
does
think
it
flatters
her
it
one
of
the
worst
daubs
you
ever
perpetrated
laughed
katrine
oh
i
should
hardly
imagine
her
an
art
critic
besides
she
so
very
plain
in
any
case
no
picture
in
the
world
could
make
her
look
handsome
though
blundell
might
not
be
the
belle
of
the
village
a
little
vanity
lingered
nevertheless
under
her
striped
katrine
happened
to
visit
her
cottage
alone
next
day
and
found
her
in
a
state
of
much
discontent
over
her
likeness
she
plainly
did
not
consider
that
it
did
her
justice
it
makes
me
look
all
speckly
she
remonstrated
and
i
not
speckly
am
i
now
i
was
thinkin
of
askin
her
to
touch
it
up
a
bit
i
mind
payin
her
a
trifle
if
she
do
want
to
charge
too
much
for
her
time
i
was
that
set
on
sendin
it
to
my
at
chiplow
but
be
to
let
her
think
i
a
face
like
a
dough
dumplin
stuck
currants
fearing
it
would
be
impossible
to
idealize
the
portrait
to
the
satisfaction
katrine
solved
the
problem
by
taking
a
snapshot
of
her
standing
in
the
doorway
with
her
favourite
cat
in
her
arms
and
though
the
photo
did
not
flatter
her
it
presented
her
with
a
smooth
countenance
at
any
rate
it
apparently
satisfied
her
craving
for
immortalization
and
preserved
a
remembrance
also
of
her
pet
who
unfortunately
met
with
an
untimely
fate
soon
afterwards
blundell
had
lamented
the
disappearance
of
pussy
for
some
days
then
one
afternoon
when
katrine
arrived
with
her
easel
she
discovered
the
good
dame
in
the
garden
busily
engaged
in
washing
her
pans
and
kettles
why
what
a
exclaimed
katrine
is
it
a
spring
cleaning
or
a
removal
oh
miss
returned
blundell
i
just
found
the
pore
cat
drownded
in
the
well
i
drew
her
up
myself
in
the
bucket
and
it
gave
i
such
a
shock
i
went
all
of
a
tremble
she
must
have
been
there
the
whole
time
and
somehow
now
i
ca
quite
fancy
the
water
i
should
think
not
exclaimed
katrine
horrified
at
the
idea
i
sometimes
wish
i
lived
in
a
town
with
water
laid
on
and
in
the
streets
continued
blundell
i
ca
think
what
you
see
to
paint
in
these
old
cottages
the
creepers
lovely
why
they
helps
to
make
damp
they
do
be
fit
for
decent
folks
to
live
in
they
did
ought
all
to
be
pulled
down
poor
blundell
evidently
held
strong
views
on
the
deficiencies
of
her
residence
to
judge
from
a
conversation
which
miss
aubrey
and
katrine
heard
wafted
through
the
door
as
they
sat
sketching
in
her
the
minister
appeared
to
be
paying
her
a
visit
and
was
trying
to
count
up
her
blessings
for
her
a
form
of
consolation
which
from
her
tart
replies
she
keenly
resented
you
got
a
roof
over
your
head
he
urged
the
rain
comes
through
in
the
corner
she
sniffed
it
do
be
right
as
i
should
be
in
this
place
and
some
in
such
comfort
folks
as
live
soft
here
did
ought
to
go
to
heaven
but
wealthy
people
can
live
good
lives
as
well
as
poor
ones
objected
chadwick
the
minister
easy
enough
for
when
they
all
they
want
but
it
do
be
fair
they
be
gettin
it
at
both
ends
she
answered
bitterly
doth
job
serve
god
for
nought
quoted
miss
aubrey
as
they
listened
to
the
querulous
old
voice
i
quite
grasp
her
point
poor
old
soul
i
dare
say
it
much
easier
to
watch
the
wicked
flourishing
like
a
green
bay
tree
and
anticipate
his
retribution
than
to
see
the
righteous
in
such
prosperity
and
think
he
skimming
the
cream
off
both
worlds
i
admire
chadwick
patience
i
think
he
talk
her
into
a
better
frame
of
mind
before
he
leaves
her
whatever
her
notions
might
be
on
the
subject
of
future
rewards
or
punishments
granny
blundell
made
a
picturesque
model
and
that
for
the
present
was
katrine
main
concern
she
finished
both
figures
and
background
then
left
the
canvas
to
dry
so
that
she
might
add
some
last
high
lights
would
it
ever
hang
in
an
exhibition
she
asked
herself
she
had
not
yet
dared
to
broach
the
subject
to
freeman
she
looked
at
it
often
hopefully
and
wistfully
at
present
it
was
the
focus
round
which
her
dreams
centred
a
matter
of
the
utmost
importance
the
rest
of
the
girls
would
have
laughed
at
her
had
they
realized
her
ambition
in
connection
with
it
yet
after
all
so
strangely
do
things
happen
in
this
life
the
painting
of
this
very
amateur
sketch
was
a
link
in
a
chain
of
circumstances
and
if
it
did
not
bring
artistic
success
to
herself
was
to
lead
to
wider
issues
in
other
respects
than
she
could
imagine
chapter
xiii
githa
secret
with
tony
as
their
bond
of
union
the
amenities
between
gwethyn
and
githa
still
continued
they
could
hardly
be
called
chums
for
they
were
never
on
absolutely
familiar
terms
such
as
existed
between
gwethyn
and
rose
randall
the
poor
little
toadstool
natural
disposition
was
too
reserved
for
the
frank
intimacy
common
in
most
schoolgirl
friendships
she
rarely
gave
any
confidences
and
though
she
evidently
admired
gwethyn
immensely
it
was
with
a
funny
dumb
sort
of
attachment
that
did
not
express
itself
in
words
on
the
subject
of
her
home
and
her
own
private
affairs
she
was
generally
guarded
to
a
degree
once
only
did
she
break
the
ice
in
a
most
unwonted
and
unusual
burst
of
confidence
she
admitted
to
gwethyn
that
she
was
unhappy
about
her
brother
cedric
is
at
such
a
horrid
school
the
head
master
is
a
brute
none
of
the
boys
like
him
and
he
taken
a
particular
spite
against
ceddie
and
is
absolutely
hateful
to
him
you
see
it
mainly
a
and
there
are
only
fourteen
boarders
cedric
is
the
eldest
of
them
by
three
years
and
he
thinks
it
very
hard
he
should
have
to
keep
exactly
the
same
rules
as
the
little
chaps
but
hawkins
wo
make
any
difference
he
treats
ceddie
as
if
he
were
at
a
preparatory
school
a
blustering
bullying
domineering
sort
of
man
very
fond
of
using
the
cane
well
you
know
a
boy
of
sixteen
wo
stand
all
that
especially
cedric
he
frightfully
proud
and
independent
and
he
answers
old
hawkins
back
and
then
there
are
squalls
sometimes
it
gets
to
such
a
pass
that
cedric
says
he
run
away
i
really
believe
he
will
some
day
it
past
all
bearing
ca
your
uncle
interfere
asked
gwethyn
it
no
use
telling
uncle
wilfred
he
always
says
he
not
going
to
listen
to
complaints
and
that
cedric
is
quite
as
well
treated
at
school
as
he
used
to
be
and
that
boys
are
a
soft
set
nowadays
and
have
the
grit
their
fathers
used
to
have
and
that
he
does
think
anything
of
a
lad
who
comes
whining
home
after
a
few
strokes
with
a
cane
which
are
probably
only
too
well
deserved
that
stops
cedric
mouth
he
bear
uncle
to
think
him
a
coward
all
the
same
he
often
in
a
very
tight
fix
and
i
wish
we
could
see
some
way
out
of
it
i
suppose
your
uncle
wilfred
is
his
guardian
yes
unfortunately
there
nobody
else
we
have
another
uncle
but
he
went
out
to
america
years
and
years
ago
and
we
heard
nothing
of
him
i
wish
i
knew
his
address
perhaps
cedric
might
have
gone
to
him
in
america
uncle
wilfred
is
decent
enough
to
me
because
i
a
girl
but
he
says
it
wholesome
for
boys
to
be
knocked
about
a
little
sometimes
aunt
julia
says
hawkins
is
too
strict
but
uncle
always
stands
up
for
him
and
takes
his
side
against
cedric
aunt
is
quite
kind
she
sends
ceddie
cakes
and
hampers
of
jam
every
now
and
then
but
those
do
make
up
for
hawkins
being
such
a
beast
he
and
cedric
just
hate
each
other
gwethyn
was
deeply
interested
but
could
suggest
no
remedy
there
seemed
indeed
no
way
out
of
such
a
difficult
situation
her
warm
sympathy
however
quite
touched
githa
i
never
thought
you
care
about
my
affairs
she
faltered
care
you
silly
child
of
course
i
care
protested
gwethyn
i
as
sorry
about
it
as
i
can
be
why
did
you
tell
me
before
it
never
struck
me
to
tell
you
uncle
wilfred
and
aunt
julia
do
care
to
hear
things
so
i
thought
other
people
might
be
the
same
ceddie
and
i
are
nothing
to
you
yes
you
are
and
please
to
remember
that
in
future
i
do
want
to
be
inquisitive
and
pry
into
your
private
concerns
but
i
very
interested
in
anything
you
may
wish
me
to
know
we
ca
be
friends
when
such
an
absolute
oyster
the
poor
toadstool
sighed
and
smiled
at
the
same
time
she
had
been
too
afraid
of
snubs
to
open
her
heart
readily
her
present
outpouring
though
in
a
sense
a
relief
was
also
an
effort
perhaps
she
thought
she
had
revealed
too
much
of
her
home
atmosphere
for
she
closed
up
again
and
for
days
gwethyn
could
get
nothing
at
all
out
of
her
fortunately
gwethyn
had
the
tact
to
leave
her
alone
and
make
no
attempt
to
force
her
confidence
she
realized
that
such
an
odd
prickly
little
character
must
be
treated
with
discretion
and
that
the
sympathy
which
she
was
burning
to
offer
was
in
certain
moods
as
likely
to
offend
as
to
please
her
peculiar
friend
for
the
last
three
days
githa
had
been
more
than
usually
what
the
girls
called
toadish
she
would
speak
to
nobody
or
if
baited
into
words
her
retorts
were
of
a
stinging
quality
not
encouraging
to
further
conversation
she
was
late
for
school
one
morning
and
went
off
in
a
great
hurry
in
the
afternoon
in
class
she
seemed
preoccupied
and
was
several
times
reprimanded
by
miss
andrews
for
not
attending
to
the
lessons
she
took
the
reproofs
rather
sulkily
her
had
many
wrangles
with
her
about
quite
trivial
matters
you
always
were
a
cross
little
toad
but
your
temper
got
worse
than
ever
declared
the
outraged
novie
bates
after
an
unprovoked
push
from
githa
in
the
classroom
you
should
stand
in
my
way
then
i
wanted
to
get
to
my
desk
retorted
the
toadstool
snappily
opening
the
lid
about
two
inches
to
slip
in
a
book
you
very
surreptitious
about
your
precious
desk
bantered
lena
dawson
for
the
mere
sake
of
teasing
what
have
you
got
inside
it
for
once
the
pale
little
face
was
fiery
if
you
dare
to
touch
my
desk
stamped
githa
in
a
perfect
fury
lena
had
never
intended
to
touch
it
but
thus
challenged
she
thought
it
rather
fun
to
as
she
expressed
it
make
githa
let
off
squibs
what
a
she
exclaimed
i
janitor
this
week
my
child
so
i
a
right
to
look
into
anybody
desk
if
i
like
and
report
its
condition
it
my
solemn
duty
to
examine
yours
now
and
see
if
it
reaches
the
standard
of
neatness
required
ahem
in
this
very
select
scholastic
establishment
naturally
you
do
wish
to
risk
the
loss
of
an
order
mark
but
duty
is
duty
my
hearty
you
blithering
idiot
flared
githa
holding
down
the
lid
of
her
desk
and
pushing
lena
away
with
her
elbow
now
that
equivalent
to
assaulting
the
police
i
must
trouble
you
to
show
me
the
inside
of
this
will
someone
please
help
me
novie
bates
and
jess
howard
giggling
their
hardest
came
to
lena
aid
the
three
easily
pulled
githa
aside
and
flung
open
the
desk
within
were
several
paper
bags
into
which
lena
on
a
plea
of
ex
officio
insisted
on
peeping
hello
what
have
we
got
here
scraps
of
meat
and
potatoes
cake
by
the
muses
you
having
a
good
old
feast
do
you
come
and
refresh
during
recreation
githa
flush
of
colour
had
faded
her
cheeks
were
drab
again
as
the
fungus
to
which
gwethyn
had
originally
compared
them
her
dark
eyes
were
inscrutable
it
no
business
of
yours
if
i
do
she
parried
oh
certainly
not
munch
away
as
hard
as
you
please
if
you
like
it
does
affect
us
we
willingly
spread
honey
on
the
if
it
would
sweeten
your
temper
there
lena
let
her
alone
pleaded
jess
who
thought
the
teasing
had
gone
far
enough
if
you
were
so
touchy
githa
nobody
trouble
to
bother
about
you
it
your
own
fault
if
you
get
ragged
do
be
absurd
we
not
going
to
run
away
with
your
precious
parcels
you
need
stand
guarding
them
like
an
old
hen
cackling
over
its
eggs
go
and
have
a
picnic
with
them
in
the
garden
jeered
lena
tell
mother
franklin
she
does
give
you
enough
at
and
you
have
to
bring
extra
supplies
to
school
she
not
refuse
you
a
second
helping
if
you
asked
some
people
have
big
appetites
it
a
silly
secret
to
make
such
a
fuss
about
i
call
it
greedy
scoffed
novie
on
that
very
same
afternoon
between
four
and
five
katrine
and
gwethyn
were
walking
together
in
the
orchard
the
two
often
liked
to
have
a
private
chat
though
gwethyn
chummed
with
rose
randall
katrine
had
not
made
any
special
friendship
among
the
sixth
and
mostly
counted
upon
her
sister
for
company
they
had
kept
their
adventure
at
the
grange
to
themselves
and
they
talked
of
it
now
as
they
sauntered
between
the
it
a
quaint
old
house
said
katrine
we
did
half
examine
it
when
we
were
there
i
should
like
to
look
again
at
that
panelling
in
the
library
and
take
a
rough
pencil
sketch
of
it
i
believe
it
just
what
i
want
for
one
of
my
pictures
shall
we
scoot
and
go
across
the
fields
yes
by
all
means
if
you
guarantee
we
not
get
locked
up
freeman
might
be
handy
a
second
time
oh
we
be
very
careful
and
inspect
all
the
before
we
venture
into
the
rooms
come
along
it
will
be
rather
sport
needless
to
say
gwethyn
acquiesced
the
mere
fun
of
dodging
the
school
authorities
and
paying
a
second
surreptitious
visit
to
the
old
grange
appealed
to
her
she
did
not
care
very
much
about
the
artistic
merits
of
the
panels
or
wish
to
sketch
them
so
again
the
girls
climbed
the
fence
and
manoeuvred
across
the
fields
under
cover
of
the
hedges
it
looks
as
if
a
bicycle
had
been
here
lately
said
katrine
examining
some
tracks
on
the
gravel
as
she
opened
the
gate
perhaps
we
have
the
place
to
ourselves
keep
a
then
we
can
soon
scoot
if
necessary
observing
due
caution
they
entered
the
house
by
the
same
window
as
on
a
former
occasion
very
softly
they
stole
down
the
passage
past
the
the
library
door
stood
ajar
and
katrine
pushed
it
open
she
stopped
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
on
some
upturned
boxes
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
sat
githa
and
a
boy
who
was
eating
something
hastily
out
of
a
paper
bag
at
the
sight
of
strangers
he
jumped
up
with
a
wild
hunted
look
on
his
face
and
unlatching
the
french
window
disappeared
into
the
garden
in
the
space
of
a
few
seconds
githa
had
also
sprung
to
her
feet
katrine
gwethyn
are
you
alone
or
is
miss
aubrey
or
anyone
with
you
she
faltered
all
serene
we
quite
by
ourselves
githa
ran
promptly
to
the
window
she
called
come
back
ceddie
the
boy
did
not
reply
and
after
waiting
a
little
githa
turned
again
to
her
friends
you
plumped
upon
my
secret
so
i
may
as
well
tell
you
i
know
you
wo
give
me
away
we
be
burnt
at
the
stake
first
protested
gwethyn
well
i
dare
say
you
guess
that
was
my
brother
poor
old
ceddie
been
in
fearful
trouble
and
he
run
away
from
school
he
always
said
he
would
and
now
he
done
it
at
last
i
told
you
hawkins
was
a
beast
he
caught
ceddie
smoking
a
cigarette
and
said
he
meant
to
make
an
example
of
him
he
was
just
white
with
passion
he
hauled
ceddie
into
the
big
classroom
and
made
the
janitor
hold
him
over
a
chair
and
then
thrashed
him
simply
brutally
before
all
the
school
he
gave
him
seventeen
strokes
ceddie
did
care
so
much
about
the
pain
he
bore
it
like
a
stoic
but
it
was
such
an
indignity
to
be
caned
like
that
a
tall
fellow
of
sixteen
before
all
those
little
boys
he
took
the
first
opportunity
and
bolted
that
very
evening
he
says
he
rather
die
than
go
back
to
school
i
try
and
get
him
to
come
in
and
speak
to
you
githa
ran
into
the
garden
and
apparently
used
her
powers
of
persuasion
successfully
for
after
a
short
time
she
came
back
accompanied
by
her
brother
whom
she
introduced
to
her
friends
cedric
was
rather
a
lad
painfully
shy
however
and
much
oppressed
by
the
awkwardness
of
the
situation
he
did
not
seem
disposed
to
talk
to
the
visitors
and
stood
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
looking
out
of
the
window
and
whistling
softly
as
their
presence
only
seemed
to
embarrass
him
katrine
and
gwethyn
had
the
tact
to
go
away
githa
walked
with
them
down
the
passage
he
been
here
three
days
she
confided
he
knew
there
be
a
frightful
after
him
so
he
lying
low
until
it
over
of
course
we
dare
let
uncle
know
where
he
is
there
ever
such
a
hullabaloo
going
on
about
it
all
at
home
but
i
look
absolutely
stolid
and
do
breathe
a
word
i
come
every
day
and
bring
him
food
and
he
sleeps
on
some
straw
in
the
attic
he
rather
do
that
than
be
sent
back
to
old
hawkins
tender
mercies
does
your
uncle
know
how
he
was
thrashed
i
not
sure
probably
hawkins
only
told
his
own
side
of
the
story
i
dare
ask
anything
i
so
afraid
of
letting
out
the
secret
but
he
ca
stay
here
for
ever
no
he
just
waiting
until
things
blow
over
then
he
do
a
bolt
at
night
and
walk
to
settlefield
and
try
and
enlist
he
wild
to
join
the
army
but
he
too
young
gasped
katrine
he
very
tall
for
his
age
and
of
course
he
pretend
he
was
eighteen
katrine
was
aghast
at
such
a
plan
it
seemed
to
failure
cedric
might
be
tall
but
his
boyish
figure
and
youthful
face
would
proclaim
to
any
recruiting
sergeant
that
he
was
below
the
age
for
enlistment
she
stated
her
opinion
emphatically
and
urged
githa
to
persuade
him
to
give
up
so
foolish
a
notion
oh
dear
whatever
are
we
to
do
then
sighed
the
worried
little
toadstool
we
both
counted
on
his
getting
into
the
army
i
at
my
wits
end
i
suppose
he
have
to
tramp
to
liverpool
and
get
on
a
ship
as
a
or
a
stoker
and
work
his
passage
to
america
perhaps
he
find
uncle
frank
there
i
afraid
that
would
be
worse
still
said
katrine
gently
you
trust
your
uncle
wilfred
perhaps
if
he
really
heard
cedric
side
of
the
case
he
would
take
him
away
from
this
school
and
see
about
fitting
him
for
what
he
to
be
in
the
future
after
all
he
his
guardian
and
a
very
harsh
one
no
i
dare
tell
uncle
wilfred
ceddie
must
try
to
get
to
america
other
boys
have
run
away
and
made
their
own
fortunes
but
how
many
have
done
the
opposite
urged
katrine
do
let
him
throw
away
his
life
like
this
have
you
no
friend
you
could
ask
to
help
him
githa
shook
her
head
forlornly
nobody
cares
to
bother
about
us
i
wish
father
and
mother
were
in
england
said
gwethyn
oh
how
i
wish
they
were
exclaimed
githa
with
a
flash
of
hope
on
her
face
that
faded
as
suddenly
as
it
arose
but
what
the
use
of
wishing
when
we
know
they
in
australia
the
suggestion
had
given
katrine
an
idea
however
would
you
trust
your
secret
to
mr
freeman
she
asked
he
one
of
the
kindest
men
i
know
and
perhaps
he
be
able
to
think
of
some
way
out
of
the
matter
i
need
tell
him
that
cedric
is
hiding
at
the
grange
as
githa
hesitated
i
simply
state
the
facts
of
the
case
and
ask
for
his
advice
oh
dare
we
trust
him
he
would
let
hawkins
get
hold
of
ceddie
i
promise
he
would
having
wrung
a
somewhat
unwilling
consent
katrine
hurried
away
before
githa
had
time
to
change
her
mind
in
defiance
of
all
school
rules
she
and
gwethyn
went
straight
to
the
village
and
called
at
lodgings
they
found
their
friend
painting
in
his
studio
and
having
first
pledged
him
to
strictest
secrecy
poured
out
their
story
whew
poor
little
chap
he
exclaimed
he
seems
to
have
got
himself
into
a
precious
mess
sleeping
on
straw
did
you
say
and
living
on
scraps
his
sister
brings
him
no
no
he
must
think
of
running
off
to
america
so
ledbury
is
his
uncle
the
solicitor
at
carford
well
as
it
happens
he
doing
some
legal
business
for
me
at
present
so
i
fancy
i
might
open
negotiations
with
him
very
diplomatically
of
course
do
be
afraid
i
stand
the
boy
friend
it
high
time
they
were
thinking
what
to
make
of
him
leave
it
in
my
hands
and
i
see
if
i
ca
talk
the
uncle
round
oh
thanks
so
much
exclaimed
the
girls
you
do
know
what
a
relief
it
is
to
hand
the
matter
over
to
you
now
we
must
scoot
or
we
shall
get
into
trouble
at
school
ourselves
on
this
occasion
katrine
and
gwethyn
went
straight
to
study
and
reported
themselves
for
having
broken
bounds
the
principal
glared
at
them
entered
the
offence
in
her
private
ledger
and
harangued
them
on
its
enormity
but
as
they
had
made
voluntary
confession
she
gave
them
no
special
punishment
on
the
whole
they
considered
they
had
got
off
rather
more
easily
than
they
had
expected
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
that
poor
laddie
sleeping
all
alone
in
that
dismal
old
house
said
katrine
as
the
sisters
went
to
bed
that
night
it
gives
me
the
creeps
even
to
imagine
it
he
looked
a
jolly
boy
he
and
githa
seem
to
have
hard
luck
it
was
too
bad
to
leave
them
utterly
to
their
uncle
charity
the
grandfather
ought
to
have
provided
for
them
properly
agreed
gwethyn
people
should
make
just
wills
before
they
die
githa
came
to
school
the
next
morning
with
dark
rings
round
her
eyes
she
admitted
having
lain
awake
most
of
the
night
worrying
about
her
brother
if
freeman
ca
help
us
ceddie
means
to
start
for
liverpool
she
whispered
to
gwethyn
during
the
interval
the
three
girls
spent
an
anxious
day
they
wondered
continually
if
their
friend
were
working
on
their
behalf
and
with
what
success
at
about
three
freeman
called
at
the
school
and
asked
franklin
permission
to
speak
to
katrine
he
had
good
news
to
report
he
had
seen
ledbury
and
had
spoken
to
him
about
cedric
without
betraying
the
boy
whereabouts
which
indeed
he
did
not
himself
know
he
found
that
ledbury
exhibited
the
utmost
relief
at
hearing
tidings
of
the
runaway
he
said
he
had
been
making
inquiries
and
discovered
through
information
given
him
by
one
of
the
under
masters
that
the
school
was
not
what
he
had
thought
it
to
be
and
that
the
punishment
given
to
his
nephew
had
been
excessive
and
brutal
in
the
extreme
he
was
sorry
that
he
had
ever
placed
the
boy
in
hawkins
charge
and
should
at
once
remove
him
he
sent
a
message
to
cedric
telling
him
to
return
home
and
that
all
would
be
forgiven
he
seemed
anxious
to
do
his
best
for
his
nephew
and
to
give
him
a
good
start
in
life
i
was
able
to
make
a
proposition
added
freeman
which
opens
a
way
for
the
boy
immediate
future
my
brother
is
in
the
admiralty
department
and
i
am
almost
sure
that
i
can
persuade
him
to
give
cedric
a
nomination
for
the
navy
they
want
lads
of
his
age
at
present
and
i
should
think
the
life
would
just
suit
the
young
chap
so
let
his
sister
tell
him
to
go
home
i
do
suppose
his
uncle
will
exactly
kill
the
fatted
calf
for
him
but
he
wo
be
thrashed
or
sent
back
to
school
i
guarantee
that
githa
eyes
shone
with
gratitude
when
katrine
told
her
the
result
of
freeman
kind
offices
as
peacemaker
oh
i
am
so
relieved
so
thankful
ceddie
would
love
to
get
into
the
navy
it
would
be
far
nicer
than
enlisting
as
a
private
how
proud
i
should
be
of
him
in
his
uniform
i
fly
now
on
my
bike
to
the
grange
and
get
ceddie
to
come
straight
home
with
me
i
believe
aunt
julia
will
be
glad
oh
how
ripping
to
have
cedric
at
home
again
you
and
gwethyn
are
just
the
biggest
trumps
on
earth
as
freeman
had
prognosticated
the
runaway
was
not
received
with
any
great
outward
demonstration
of
joy
by
his
uncle
and
aunt
though
both
were
secretly
much
relieved
at
his
reappearance
matters
took
an
unexpected
turn
however
for
the
poor
lad
had
caught
cold
by
sleeping
on
damp
straw
in
the
empty
house
and
was
confined
to
bed
with
a
sharp
attack
of
rheumatism
his
illness
brought
out
all
the
kindness
in
his
aunt
nature
she
had
always
had
rather
a
soft
corner
for
him
though
she
had
not
been
willing
to
admit
it
and
had
generally
persuaded
herself
that
the
two
children
were
a
burden
she
nursed
him
well
now
and
was
so
good
to
him
during
his
convalescence
that
githa
manner
thawed
and
the
girl
was
more
at
ease
with
her
aunt
than
she
had
ever
been
before
a
wonderfully
pleasant
and
unusual
state
of
affairs
freeman
representations
at
the
admiralty
had
the
desired
effect
cedric
received
his
nomination
and
in
due
course
when
the
doctor
would
pronounce
him
fit
was
to
go
up
for
his
examination
he
was
wild
with
enthusiasm
if
i
can
only
get
quickly
into
the
fighting
line
he
declared
i
just
enjoy
myself
get
well
first
commanded
githa
whose
sisterly
pride
seemed
to
think
her
brother
destined
to
become
at
least
an
admiral
chapter
xiv
a
midnight
alarm
bob
gartley
had
not
the
best
of
reputations
in
heathwell
he
had
more
than
once
been
convicted
on
a
charge
of
poaching
and
had
served
time
in
carford
jail
of
late
his
aversion
to
work
had
become
so
marked
that
his
presence
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
seemed
a
doubtful
benefit
to
his
wife
and
his
olive
branches
the
numerous
young
gartleys
learnt
rapidly
to
scuttle
out
of
reach
of
the
parental
fist
and
spent
a
great
portion
of
their
time
sitting
upon
or
playing
under
hedgerows
oblivious
of
damp
or
dirt
while
poor
gartley
who
received
the
brunt
of
her
spouse
covered
up
her
bruises
and
put
the
best
face
she
could
on
the
matter
towards
the
world
her
labours
had
to
provide
for
the
household
her
better
half
uncertain
and
occasional
earnings
being
liable
to
be
forestalled
at
the
dragon
why
they
gives
him
credit
passes
me
she
confided
to
stubbs
who
having
gone
through
similar
experiences
was
loud
in
her
condolence
it
be
a
speculation
on
stephen
peters
part
replied
the
worthy
vendor
of
antiques
he
knows
he
can
get
it
in
kind
if
not
in
cash
and
he
be
fond
of
a
pheasant
for
his
sunday
dinner
but
bob
had
best
be
careful
for
the
keepers
are
on
the
watch
more
than
ever
and
if
he
is
taken
again
so
soon
he
get
an
extra
hard
sentence
i
sure
i
warned
him
till
i
hoarse
but
it
seems
no
use
he
never
listens
to
i
one
sunday
morning
the
obdurate
bob
gartley
might
have
been
found
sitting
by
the
fireside
in
his
own
kitchen
he
was
attired
in
his
and
had
not
yet
had
the
temerity
to
attempt
either
washing
or
shaving
but
he
consoled
himself
for
these
deficiencies
by
puffing
away
at
his
pipe
and
taking
an
occasional
glance
into
a
saucepan
whence
issued
a
savoury
odour
strongly
suggestive
of
hare
or
some
other
unlawful
delicacy
the
seven
little
gartleys
having
found
their
father
in
a
very
unsabbatical
frame
of
mind
had
wisely
removed
themselves
from
his
vicinity
and
were
at
present
scrambling
about
in
the
road
awaiting
with
impatience
the
arrival
of
the
coming
to
the
door
occasionally
to
indulge
in
anticipatory
sniffs
but
being
promptly
scared
away
by
a
warning
growl
from
the
keep
they
brats
out
of
my
sight
roared
gartley
fiercely
turning
to
his
wife
who
was
making
a
slight
endeavour
to
tidy
up
the
cottage
why
ca
you
pack
off
to
church
and
sunday
school
i
were
always
sent
regular
when
i
were
a
boy
much
good
it
done
for
you
retorted
gartley
scornfully
not
but
what
i
send
the
children
if
they
any
decent
clothes
to
their
backs
i
be
to
let
go
though
in
the
same
rags
they
wears
week
in
and
week
out
and
their
toes
through
the
ends
of
their
boots
it
do
be
fair
as
we
poor
folks
should
have
to
take
the
leavin
of
everything
remarked
gartley
waxing
sententious
why
should
my
children
be
dressed
as
well
as
captain
gordon
because
you
ca
buy
the
clothes
i
suppose
what
the
use
of
askin
such
questions
i
like
to
see
in
white
dresses
and
tweed
suits
continued
gartley
who
might
have
been
a
model
father
as
far
as
aspirations
were
concerned
off
proper
and
regular
to
church
of
a
sunday
precious
likely
when
all
you
got
goes
at
the
it
a
shame
as
some
should
be
rich
and
some
poor
there
were
a
man
come
round
last
election
time
and
said
as
how
everything
ought
to
be
divided
up
equal
share
and
share
alike
and
the
workin
classes
would
stand
bein
oppressed
much
longer
they
rise
and
throw
off
the
yoke
those
was
his
very
words
some
as
is
doin
nothing
now
would
have
to
set
their
hands
to
work
if
you
mean
yourself
it
might
be
a
good
business
no
it
the
idle
rich
i
be
talkin
of
like
everard
or
captain
gordon
or
even
parson
for
what
does
he
do
i
should
like
to
know
beyond
preach
and
that
an
easy
enough
job
what
right
have
captain
gordon
or
everard
to
the
hares
and
pheasants
they
be
wild
things
and
i
says
let
anybody
take
as
can
catch
the
folks
in
scripture
went
out
huntin
and
we
not
told
as
it
was
called
poachin
they
did
bring
esau
up
before
the
magistrates
for
gettin
his
venison
gartley
shook
her
head
such
reasoning
was
utterly
beyond
her
powers
of
argument
i
reckon
times
was
different
then
she
ventured
they
be
cruel
bad
for
us
poor
folks
just
now
we
be
as
good
as
anybody
else
if
we
had
the
money
urged
her
husband
you
a
wench
still
jane
if
you
a
silk
dress
and
a
big
hat
with
feathers
like
mrs
gordon
what
the
use
o
talkin
replied
gartley
amazed
at
the
unwonted
compliment
i
never
likely
to
wear
a
silk
dress
this
side
the
grave
unlikelier
things
has
come
to
happen
than
that
we
might
be
somebodies
if
if
what
if
something
i
got
in
my
mind
was
to
come
off
what
do
you
mean
oh
nothing
particular
only
it
would
be
uncommon
nice
to
set
up
as
fine
as
other
folks
in
a
new
country
where
no
one
knowed
what
we
had
been
i
do
understand
would
you
like
to
go
out
to
america
or
australia
and
start
afresh
why
yes
but
we
have
got
a
penny
to
go
with
no
more
we
have
that
true
chuckled
gartley
you
say
uncommon
clever
things
sometimes
jane
no
we
not
got
a
to
pay
our
fares
at
present
what
are
you
drivin
at
nothing
do
you
begin
askin
questions
you
best
keep
a
still
tongue
in
your
head
and
shut
your
eyes
as
far
as
i
concerned
oh
bob
you
never
going
to
be
at
some
of
your
old
tricks
i
tell
you
it
not
safe
a
stray
hare
now
and
again
is
bad
enough
but
when
it
comes
to
shut
up
commanded
gartley
angrily
i
mind
my
own
business
and
you
may
mind
yours
go
and
turn
those
squalling
brats
off
the
they
send
me
mad
with
their
noise
i
make
go
to
church
another
time
clothes
or
no
clothes
parson
may
put
in
clean
pinafores
if
he
so
anxious
to
have
at
sunday
school
gartley
fled
to
disperse
her
family
and
wisely
refrained
from
any
further
inquiries
about
her
husband
intentions
arguments
she
knew
were
wasted
upon
him
and
it
was
useless
to
distress
herself
with
too
close
a
knowledge
of
his
devious
methods
of
acquiring
a
living
i
can
guess
what
he
after
she
thought
and
if
he
caught
give
he
seven
years
it
mean
the
poorhouse
for
i
and
the
children
well
it
no
use
talkin
for
once
bob
set
his
mind
on
a
thing
do
it
he
will
when
his
wife
was
safely
out
of
the
way
gartley
retired
upstairs
to
the
bedroom
where
after
moving
a
heavy
oak
chest
he
laid
bare
a
loose
plank
in
the
floor
this
he
lifted
and
from
some
receptacle
below
he
drew
a
dark
lantern
and
one
or
two
tools
of
peculiar
workmanship
he
stored
these
treasures
in
his
pockets
then
replacing
the
plank
he
lifted
the
chest
back
into
its
accustomed
position
she
no
idea
where
i
keep
he
muttered
and
it
best
as
she
should
know
i
may
as
well
try
folks
be
always
abed
early
and
sleep
sound
on
sundays
parson
would
say
it
was
their
good
conscience
my
old
granny
had
a
sayin
better
the
day
the
better
the
deed
so
good
luck
to
my
work
and
may
we
soon
be
off
to
america
on
this
identical
sunday
it
happened
that
a
few
of
the
aireyholme
girls
taking
a
walk
with
their
principal
in
the
afternoon
met
and
ledbury
and
githa
who
were
also
out
for
exercise
now
githa
had
brought
tony
and
gwethyn
who
was
with
the
school
party
fell
upon
her
pet
with
the
rapture
due
to
long
separation
franklin
was
not
at
all
fond
of
dogs
but
on
this
occasion
she
was
in
a
singularly
gracious
and
generous
mood
she
had
had
a
pleasant
little
chat
with
and
ledbury
and
when
turning
to
go
she
noticed
gwethyn
unwillingness
to
part
with
her
darling
tony
it
very
kind
of
githa
to
take
charge
of
your
dog
she
remarked
if
you
like
you
may
bring
him
home
with
you
this
afternoon
and
keep
him
until
gwethyn
walked
away
cuddling
her
treasure
closely
to
have
her
pet
to
herself
even
for
hours
was
an
indulgence
sufficient
to
make
her
forgive
franklin
for
many
other
strictnesses
master
tony
was
the
idol
of
the
school
at
he
was
a
vain
little
dog
who
loved
admiration
and
that
afternoon
he
was
cosseted
to
his
heart
content
he
held
almost
a
royal
reception
everybody
declaring
him
perfectly
sweet
i
wish
we
even
a
yard
dog
at
aireyholme
said
rose
randall
it
a
pity
franklin
detests
them
so
she
was
quite
kind
to
tony
how
well
he
looks
the
darling
almost
too
fat
now
instead
of
being
too
thin
precious
one
are
you
going
to
sleep
with
your
own
missis
evidently
master
tony
had
no
intention
of
being
left
alone
for
when
nine
came
he
trotted
upstairs
with
gwethyn
and
promptly
installed
himself
on
her
bed
miss
andrews
coming
her
at
nine
noticed
the
silky
head
peeping
from
under
the
that
covered
him
but
she
kindly
took
no
notice
for
once
he
was
to
be
privileged
everyone
seems
to
go
to
bed
early
on
sunday
night
remarked
katrine
taking
a
glance
through
the
window
at
the
silent
village
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
below
the
school
perhaps
it
the
mental
effort
of
listening
that
exhausts
their
brains
i
dare
say
on
many
of
them
are
like
the
agricultural
labourer
in
who
said
he
thought
of
nought
people
seem
far
more
tired
with
two
services
than
with
a
day
work
in
the
fields
the
girls
had
been
sound
asleep
for
a
long
time
when
gwethyn
was
suddenly
disturbed
by
an
uneasy
whimper
from
tony
wideawake
in
a
moment
she
sat
up
what
the
matter
my
precious
the
room
was
in
complete
darkness
but
she
could
tell
from
the
warning
growl
that
he
was
all
on
the
alert
do
you
hear
anything
tony
low
grumble
was
a
sufficient
answer
in
his
own
language
is
it
rats
be
quiet
gwethyn
and
let
us
listen
too
said
katrine
who
was
also
aroused
i
thought
i
heard
a
queer
noise
in
dead
silence
the
girls
waited
for
a
minute
or
two
all
was
still
then
came
a
curious
subdued
sound
like
the
very
gentle
working
backwards
and
forwards
of
a
file
what
is
it
whispered
gwethyn
i
do
know
it
seems
to
come
from
downstairs
yes
most
certainly
is
it
a
rat
gnawing
that
no
rat
has
a
bird
got
into
the
chimney
no
it
sounds
quite
different
i
believe
it
outside
shall
i
strike
a
match
better
not
i
want
to
listen
at
the
window
katrine
crept
out
of
bed
and
groped
her
way
across
the
dark
room
to
the
open
casement
it
was
a
cloudy
night
with
neither
moon
nor
star
in
the
sky
and
the
view
was
one
uniform
mass
of
blackness
the
silence
was
almost
oppressive
none
of
the
ordinary
country
noises
were
to
be
heard
not
a
cow
lowed
nor
a
solitary
owl
hooted
all
the
world
lay
hushed
in
quiet
sleep
the
darkness
seemed
to
hedge
them
round
and
cut
them
off
from
the
rest
of
the
slumbering
humanity
in
the
village
tony
had
followed
katrine
and
pushed
his
cold
moist
nose
into
her
hand
as
she
bent
down
to
pat
him
she
could
feel
his
whole
body
quivering
with
tense
agitation
he
knows
something
is
wrong
or
he
would
be
upset
like
this
she
thought
again
from
the
darkness
outside
came
that
curious
subdued
scraping
sound
their
bedroom
was
over
the
porch
could
a
strange
dog
be
scratching
at
the
door
beneath
or
some
wild
animal
a
weasel
or
a
stoat
perhaps
be
seeking
an
entrance
she
leaned
cautiously
from
the
window
trying
in
vain
to
distinguish
any
object
her
heart
was
beating
fast
and
she
was
trembling
with
nervousness
the
noise
ceased
again
there
was
a
moment
pause
and
for
one
second
she
saw
a
gleam
of
light
in
the
garden
below
instantly
a
sudden
illumination
swept
over
her
mind
it
was
neither
rat
bird
dog
stoat
nor
weasel
but
a
human
being
that
was
disturbing
their
peace
gwethyn
she
breathed
in
a
whisper
somebody
is
trying
to
break
in
through
the
window
at
the
very
suggestion
of
burglars
gwethyn
gave
a
shriek
of
terror
which
set
tony
barking
loudly
enough
to
have
disturbed
the
forty
thieves
so
furious
was
his
anger
against
the
unknown
intruder
that
he
would
have
leaped
through
the
window
if
she
had
not
held
him
by
the
collar
all
his
doggish
instincts
urged
him
to
defend
his
mistresses
and
he
was
ready
to
fly
at
the
throat
of
whoever
had
set
foot
in
the
garden
below
the
noise
disturbed
the
other
occupants
of
the
landing
the
girls
came
running
from
their
rooms
to
inquire
the
cause
of
the
upset
franklin
appeared
upon
the
scene
with
the
promptitude
of
practice
on
grasping
the
fact
that
an
attempt
was
being
made
to
break
into
the
house
she
ran
to
the
big
school
bell
and
tolled
an
alarm
signal
calculated
to
waken
the
whole
village
she
went
on
ringing
vigorously
until
shouts
and
running
footsteps
outside
assured
her
of
help
white
from
the
farm
near
at
hand
and
some
of
his
boys
were
the
first
to
arrive
but
they
were
followed
almost
immediately
by
the
blacksmith
the
saddler
and
a
number
of
cottagers
till
quite
a
little
crowd
had
collected
in
the
drive
franklin
hastily
explained
the
situation
and
some
of
the
men
taking
lanterns
made
a
thorough
examination
of
the
premises
this
midnight
alarm
caused
a
great
stir
in
heathwell
such
a
thing
as
an
attempted
burglary
had
hitherto
been
absolutely
unknown
and
the
inhabitants
felt
that
it
was
a
reflection
on
the
village
the
policeman
paid
a
solemn
call
at
aireyholme
produced
his
notebook
and
asked
a
multitude
of
questions
particularly
of
katrine
and
gwethyn
but
the
girls
could
give
little
or
no
information
beyond
the
fact
that
they
had
heard
a
noise
and
seen
a
light
in
the
garden
there
was
not
a
shred
of
evidence
or
the
faintest
clue
to
lead
to
the
identification
of
the
thief
the
inspector
examined
the
frame
of
the
window
which
certainly
bore
marks
as
if
an
effort
had
been
made
to
force
it
with
some
sharp
tool
and
he
carefully
measured
the
footprints
in
the
but
as
many
of
these
had
undoubtedly
been
made
by
the
stalwart
boots
of
white
and
other
assiduous
helpers
in
the
ardour
of
their
search
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
even
a
sherlock
holmes
to
gain
any
enlightenment
from
them
nobody
in
the
village
had
seen
any
suspicious
characters
about
and
everyone
seemed
to
have
been
sound
asleep
in
bed
until
roused
by
the
ringing
of
the
aireyholme
alarm
bell
in
the
end
the
policeman
wrote
a
formal
report
to
the
effect
that
some
person
or
persons
unknown
had
made
an
attempt
to
commit
a
felony
but
had
been
interrupted
in
the
act
by
the
barking
of
the
dog
all
of
which
is
absolutely
and
did
need
a
whole
investigation
said
gwethyn
still
i
suppose
poor
old
whately
had
to
write
something
in
his
notebook
the
chief
credit
seems
to
be
due
to
tony
i
sure
he
scared
the
wretch
away
i
do
know
what
we
should
have
done
without
him
tony
was
undoubtedly
the
hero
of
the
occasion
if
he
had
been
petted
before
he
was
lionized
now
even
franklin
admitted
that
a
dog
in
the
house
was
a
great
protection
and
offered
to
let
gwethyn
keep
tony
at
aireyholme
for
the
rest
of
the
term
the
principal
had
been
more
alarmed
at
the
attempted
burglary
than
she
would
confess
to
her
pupils
she
tried
to
reassure
the
girls
telling
them
it
was
very
improbable
that
any
thief
would
make
a
second
attempt
on
the
premises
but
for
many
nights
everybody
in
the
school
slept
uneasily
and
woke
at
the
least
sound
the
only
person
in
heathwell
who
did
not
exhibit
much
excitement
at
the
news
of
the
attempt
to
break
into
aireyholme
was
bob
gartley
who
received
his
wife
very
enlarged
version
of
the
story
with
an
imperturbable
countenance
there
was
a
gang
of
them
was
there
he
remarked
all
armed
with
pistols
and
bludgeons
and
bent
on
murder
where
be
they
to
then
and
why
ai
whately
tracked
out
seems
to
me
as
if
he
know
his
business
and
he
best
retire
i
think
i
apply
for
the
job
how
would
you
like
me
as
a
police
inspector
i
no
doubt
you
be
up
to
a
trick
or
two
if
you
was
it
a
comfort
though
as
you
not
mixed
up
in
this
for
you
was
over
in
captain
gordon
preserves
at
chiselton
though
you
could
bring
that
in
as
an
alibi
yes
at
chiselton
and
that
be
four
miles
from
heathwell
if
i
likes
to
take
a
little
midnight
walk
to
admire
the
moon
i
do
see
what
call
anyone
has
to
go
interferin
with
me
everyone
has
their
hobbies
and
mine
for
enjoyin
the
beauties
o
nature
but
there
were
no
moon
last
night
objected
his
wife
what
business
is
that
o
yours
a
man
may
be
a
bit
wrong
in
the
calendar
and
go
out
to
look
for
what
ai
there
why
ca
you
get
on
with
your
washin
instead
o
standin
idlin
and
talkin
it
were
a
nearish
shave
reflected
gartley
as
his
wife
beat
a
retreat
i
only
just
nipped
over
the
wall
afore
john
white
come
runnin
out

amateur

flowery
june
had
given
place
to
blazing
july
the
pink
roses
were
fading
on
the
cottage
fronts
and
the
laburnums
had
long
been
over
tall
white
lilies
still
bloomed
in
the
village
gardens
and
geraniums
were
beginning
to
show
their
scarlet
glory
the
fresh
green
of
early
summer
had
yielded
to
darker
tones
the
trees
were
thick
masses
of
foliage
the
hedges
a
tangle
of
traveller
joy
if
the
landscape
lacked
the
inspiration
of
spring
it
was
nevertheless
full
of
rich
beauty
especially
to
eyes
trained
to
appreciate
the
picturesque
miss
sketching
class
was
at
present
quite
a
large
one
for
it
had
been
augmented
by
the
addition
of
viola
dorrie
and
diana
now
that
their
matriculation
examination
was
over
they
no
longer
needed
private
coaching
and
franklin
transferred
their
spare
hours
to
her
sister
the
three
monitresses
were
glad
of
the
change
after
the
hard
brainwork
and
the
very
close
application
that
had
been
required
from
them
they
turned
to
painting
with
the
greatest
relief
every
afternoon
a
procession
of
enthusiastic
students
bearing
and
easels
wended
its
way
from
aireyholme
at
first
miss
aubrey
had
led
her
artistic
flock
to
the
village
but
with
july
days
came
a
change
of
plans
the
council
school
broke
up
for
six
weeks
and
heathwell
was
suddenly
with
children
although
according
to
statistics
the
population
of
england
might
be
on
the
decrease
here
it
certainly
showed
no
signs
of
dwindling
small
people
were
everywhere
as
the
amateur
artists
found
to
their
cost
no
doubt
it
was
most
unreasonable
of
the
aireyholme
girls
who
liked
their
own
august
vacation
to
object
to
other
schools
having
holidays
but
they
did
not
appreciate
a
crowd
of
spectators
and
grumbled
exceedingly
to
the
last
remnants
of
peace
and
quiet
said
dorrie
simply
haunted
by
these
wretched
infants
they
seem
to
think
us
fair
game
i
had
the
whole
of
the
gartley
family
including
the
baby
sitting
round
my
feet
i
like
children
singly
or
in
pairs
or
even
up
to
half
a
dozen
protested
diana
but
when
it
comes
to
having
them
wholesale
like
this
i
feel
as
if
i
were
minding
a
crèche
oh
what
a
nuisance
they
are
it
all
comes
of
being
too
attractive
as
the
old
lady
said
when
she
was
struck
by
lightning
laughed
gwethyn
the
class
was
sketching
the
street
and
the
market
hall
some
of
the
girls
were
making
very
good
attempts
at
the
subject
and
miss
aubrey
was
most
anxious
for
them
to
finish
their
paintings
so
for
two
more
afternoons
they
braved
their
fatal
popularity
it
was
impossible
to
escape
the
too
friendly
juveniles
scouts
were
generally
waiting
to
convey
the
news
of
their
arrival
and
they
would
walk
down
the
village
followed
by
a
long
comet
tail
of
small
fry
who
would
encamp
close
to
them
on
the
steps
bringing
babies
puppies
or
kittens
eating
bread
and
treacle
munching
green
apples
and
singing
deafening
school
songs
in
chorus
it
was
not
the
slightest
use
to
tell
the
youngsters
to
go
away
they
would
only
retreat
to
a
distance
of
about
ten
yards
and
then
edge
gradually
nearer
again
i
tried
to
look
cross
and
savage
said
gladwin
riley
but
they
only
grin
i
been
trying
to
civilize
them
sighed
nan
bethell
i
suggested
to
one
youth
that
it
would
be
an
improvement
for
him
to
wash
his
particularly
grimy
little
fingers
he
looked
at
me
and
then
at
his
hands
for
a
moment
or
two
apparently
it
takes
some
time
for
the
agricultural
brain
to
turn
over
a
new
idea
then
he
remarked
briefly
likes
dirty
and
transferred
them
to
his
pockets
any
further
arguments
on
my
poor
part
would
i
felt
be
superfluous
though
the
girls
laughed
over
the
humour
of
their
experiences
they
really
found
the
children
very
trying
and
both
teacher
and
pupils
were
thankful
when
the
sketches
of
the
market
hall
were
successfully
finished
one
final
incident
seemed
the
of
their
annoyances
a
child
even
more
eager
than
the
rest
to
press
near
was
jostled
by
the
others
off
the
raised
pathway
where
she
was
standing
and
fell
with
a
crash
on
to
the
road
almost
upsetting
katrine
easel
and
smashing
a
bottle
of
vinegar
which
she
had
been
holding
clasped
in
her
arms
a
woman
who
proved
to
be
the
delinquent
mother
came
out
from
a
cottage
and
after
first
administering
a
vigorous
smack
to
her
offspring
offered
hot
water
wherewith
to
sponge
the
damaged
clothing
she
was
really
very
kind
said
katrine
afterwards
but
i
could
see
that
she
was
all
the
time
regretting
such
a
waste
of
good
vinegar
more
than
sympathizing
with
me
for
absorbing
it
i
do
believe
this
skirt
will
ever
be
fit
to
wear
again
i
know
i
shall
feel
like
a
pickled
herring
if
i
put
it
on
it
was
not
at
all
an
easy
matter
for
miss
aubrey
to
choose
a
suitable
subject
for
a
large
class
the
girls
were
at
different
stages
of
ability
and
the
beginners
must
not
be
sacrificed
to
the
cleverer
few
while
katrine
gladwin
and
perhaps
diana
could
manage
a
sketch
of
trees
hayfield
or
reedy
river
the
others
demanded
something
more
palpable
in
the
way
of
drawing
a
cottage
where
you
could
reproduce
the
lines
of
roof
door
windows
and
chimney
was
far
easier
than
a
misty
impression
of
sky
and
foliage
but
where
there
were
cottages
there
were
nearly
always
children
to
stand
and
stare
so
again
miss
aubrey
found
herself
in
a
difficulty
she
solved
it
by
taking
her
class
to
sketch
a
picturesque
little
farm
about
a
mile
and
a
half
away
from
heathwell
where
for
a
marvel
not
even
a
solitary
specimen
of
childhood
resided
the
mistress
of
the
place
was
an
attraction
in
herself
she
had
established
a
considerable
reputation
in
the
neighbourhood
as
a
herb
doctor
preparing
various
nauseous
and
brews
for
sick
cows
or
horses
or
for
human
sprained
ankles
bad
legs
toothaches
headaches
or
other
ailments
she
charmed
warts
and
cured
agues
and
was
even
held
by
many
to
be
somewhat
of
a
witch
she
was
credited
with
the
evil
eye
and
awestruck
neighbours
told
dark
tales
of
terrible
misfortunes
having
befallen
those
who
were
unfortunate
or
rash
enough
to
cross
her
will
as
it
is
rare
in
this
twentieth
century
to
meet
anybody
with
even
the
shadow
of
a
reputation
for
the
black
arts
the
girls
were
thrilled
at
the
accounts
they
heard
and
much
disappointed
that
the
old
dame
never
vouchsafed
them
an
exhibition
of
her
talents
one
day
she
invited
them
to
enter
and
they
persuaded
her
to
explain
to
them
the
various
treasures
that
adorned
her
parlour
certainly
the
collection
was
unique
two
stuffed
cocks
stood
on
the
window
seat
each
covered
with
an
antimacassar
whether
to
preserve
them
or
merely
to
display
the
crochet
work
of
which
an
example
adorned
every
chair
it
was
impossible
to
decide
while
a
third
chanticleer
on
the
mantelpiece
was
generally
used
as
a
stand
for
the
good
woman
best
bonnet
they
had
no
doubt
been
fine
birds
in
their
time
and
had
won
prizes
at
a
local
show
but
their
present
value
as
ornaments
was
a
matter
of
opinion
a
marvellous
sampler
representing
the
tabernacle
in
the
wilderness
hung
over
the
sideboard
carefully
worked
flames
were
depicted
rising
from
the
altar
and
two
cherubim
with
black
beads
for
eyes
and
white
wings
hovered
at
either
corner
a
few
sizes
too
large
for
the
building
on
the
mantelpiece
lay
two
extraordinary
objects
which
the
girls
at
first
took
to
be
shells
but
as
they
corresponded
with
no
known
specimen
of
conchology
inquiries
were
made
ah
well
said
the
old
woman
taking
them
down
tenderly
these
are
my
poor
richard
heels
the
only
thing
i
have
left
of
him
now
they
came
off
all
in
a
piece
like
that
when
he
was
peeling
after
the
scarlet
fever
indeed
i
always
kept
them
to
remember
him
by
they
the
best
i
have
i
can
generally
tell
by
them
when
it
going
to
rain
thirty
years
so
miss
aubrey
hastened
to
ascertain
had
passed
since
the
memorable
illness
therefore
they
might
reasonably
hope
that
no
germs
yet
lingered
in
the
relics
but
they
shuddered
to
think
of
the
infection
which
must
surely
have
been
spread
in
the
earlier
days
when
these
treasures
were
examined
and
handled
by
curious
neighbours
an
old
illustrated
bible
with
the
date
containing
many
crude
woodcuts
occupied
the
little
round
table
under
the
window
jones
declared
she
never
did
anything
without
consulting
it
and
the
girls
were
just
going
to
express
appreciation
of
her
pious
attention
to
scripture
when
she
explained
that
her
method
was
to
shut
her
eyes
and
opening
the
book
at
random
to
insert
the
door
key
and
close
it
again
it
had
then
to
be
turned
over
seven
times
and
whatever
text
the
key
pointed
to
was
sure
to
be
appropriate
once
so
she
declared
she
had
applied
to
it
for
advice
as
to
whether
to
go
to
law
with
a
farmer
who
had
encroached
upon
her
plot
of
land
she
had
struck
the
words
him
will
i
destroy
and
being
thus
encouraged
to
pursue
her
suit
she
had
won
her
case
in
triumph
indeed
it
always
right
she
said
putting
it
carefully
back
on
its
mat
i
call
it
my
conjuring
book
and
i
would
part
with
it
for
anything
you
could
offer
me
one
gets
odd
peeps
at
life
in
the
course
of
one
painting
adventures
said
miss
aubrey
an
artist
has
the
opportunity
of
becoming
a
good
student
of
human
nature
sketching
somehow
brings
one
into
touch
with
people
in
a
way
which
no
other
hobby
can
emulate
i
have
had
many
funny
experiences
since
i
first
took
up
the
brush
jones
beats
even
granny
blundell
at
queerness
decided
the
girls
one
afternoon
as
a
very
special
treat
miss
aubrey
decided
to
take
her
three
best
pupils
with
her
on
an
expedition
by
river
to
chistleton
the
landlord
of
the
dragon
inn
owned
a
boat
and
would
row
them
there
and
back
waiting
several
hours
for
them
in
the
town
while
they
saw
the
sights
they
were
to
start
after
an
early
lunch
and
have
tea
at
a
café
in
chistleton
katrine
diana
and
gladwin
were
the
chosen
ones
and
their
luck
was
the
envy
of
the
rest
of
the
sketching
class
who
implored
to
be
included
also
miss
aubrey
however
stuck
to
her
original
plan
she
could
not
take
more
than
three
girls
in
the
boat
and
told
the
others
they
must
be
content
to
wait
until
some
future
occasion
there
was
much
to
be
seen
in
the
old
town
the
walls
were
still
extant
and
two
of
the
ancient
gateways
remained
the
almshouses
were
show
places
and
the
castle
was
the
glory
of
the
neighbourhood
miss
aubrey
wished
to
encourage
the
girls
in
rapid
sketching
and
made
them
take
quick
pencil
impressions
of
all
the
principal
sights
she
had
refused
to
allow
them
to
bring
cameras
people
are
too
ready
to
make
snapshots
nowadays
was
her
verdict
they
are
putting
photography
in
the
place
of
drawing
i
grant
that
your
kodaks
will
give
a
perfectly
accurate
picture
but
a
photo
can
never
have
the
artistic
merit
of
a
sketch
in
my
mind
it
corresponds
to
a
piece
played
on
the
pianola
it
is
correct
but
has
no
individuality
look
at
some
of
the
pencil
sketches
of
the
great
masters
how
beautiful
is
the
touch
and
how
much
is
conveyed
in
a
few
lines
nothing
gives
a
better
art
training
than
the
habit
of
continually
jotting
down
every
pretty
bit
you
may
see
hand
and
brain
learn
to
work
together
and
you
begin
to
get
that
facility
with
your
pencil
which
nothing
but
long
practice
can
give
you
miss
aubrey
own
drawings
were
delightful
the
girls
watched
with
admiration
as
her
clever
fingers
in
a
few
minutes
transferred
some
picturesque
corner
to
paper
they
tried
their
best
to
emulate
her
and
filled
several
pages
of
their
with
quite
praiseworthy
attempts
at
the
castle
especially
they
secured
some
charming
little
subjects
it
was
a
grand
old
norman
building
half
in
ruins
with
towers
courtyard
and
the
remains
of
a
moat
the
with
its
vaulted
roof
the
oratory
with
its
rose
window
and
the
were
almost
intact
and
a
winding
staircase
led
to
a
pathway
round
the
battlements
the
girls
wandered
about
drawing
first
one
bit
and
then
another
going
frequently
to
miss
aubrey
for
good
advice
they
were
pleased
with
their
efforts
which
as
well
as
being
good
practice
would
make
delightful
reminiscences
of
the
place
it
was
perhaps
a
weakness
on
their
part
to
purchase
picture
of
the
castle
but
then
as
they
elaborately
explained
to
miss
aubrey
they
only
bought
them
to
send
away
to
friends
not
to
shirk
sketching
on
their
own
account
katrine
always
on
the
for
antiquities
listened
to
the
voice
of
an
old
vendor
of
guileless
and
respectable
appearance
who
mysteriously
intimated
that
for
a
consideration
he
would
transfer
from
his
pocket
to
hers
a
few
broken
tiles
out
of
the
oratory
the
removal
of
such
keepsakes
by
the
general
public
being
strictly
forbidden
she
yielded
to
the
temptation
pressed
a
shilling
into
his
ready
hand
and
pocketed
the
fragments
she
brought
them
in
great
triumph
and
secrecy
to
show
to
miss
aubrey
it
lovely
to
have
some
real
old
pieces
she
exclaimed
ecstatically
these
will
go
with
some
roman
tiles
that
i
have
at
home
i
shall
get
a
museum
together
in
course
of
time
i
had
to
give
the
old
chap
some
backsheesh
but
i
think
he
deserved
it
let
me
look
said
miss
aubrey
examining
the
treasures
my
dear
girl
i
grieved
to
blight
your
hopes
but
i
should
certainly
like
to
know
how
one
of
these
antique
crocks
has
the
doulton
mark
on
the
back
of
it
it
has
gasped
katrine
there
it
is
most
unmistakably
i
sorry
to
undeceive
you
but
afraid
it
no
more
mediæval
than
i
am
oh
the
craft
of
the
old
villain
mourned
katrine
i
wonder
how
often
he
tried
this
trick
on
innocent
and
unsuspecting
visitors
if
i
could
only
catch
him
i
upbraid
him
and
demand
my
money
back
you
would
get
it
you
silly
child
he
has
conveniently
vanished
and
is
perhaps
boasting
of
his
cleverness
to
a
circle
of
envious
and
admiring
friends
you
must
be
very
cautious
if
you
want
to
go
in
for
collecting
false
antiquities
are
unfortunately
more
common
than
genuine
ones
and
clever
rogues
are
always
ready
to
lay
traps
for
the
unwary
after
having
tea
at
a
café
miss
aubrey
and
the
girls
made
their
way
to
the
wharf
and
found
stephen
peters
the
landlord
of
the
dragon
ready
at
the
in
excellent
spirits
they
took
their
seats
anticipating
with
much
pleasure
their
return
trip
on
the
river
they
hadna
gane
a
mile
a
mile
as
the
ballad
says
before
they
began
to
wish
themselves
back
on
dry
land
miss
aubrey
had
not
particularly
noticed
their
boatman
condition
before
they
started
but
they
had
not
rowed
far
when
she
made
the
unpleasant
discovery
that
he
was
hardly
fit
to
handle
the
oars
he
was
in
a
jovial
mood
and
insisted
upon
bursting
into
snatches
of
song
he
was
perfectly
sober
coming
from
heathwell
he
must
have
spent
the
whole
afternoon
at
the
inn
on
the
wharf
while
he
was
waiting
for
us
thought
poor
miss
aubrey
trying
to
conceal
her
fears
from
her
pupils
the
girls
were
very
naturally
alarmed
for
peters
was
rowing
in
a
particularly
crooked
fashion
continually
bumping
into
the
banks
and
running
into
clumps
of
overhanging
willows
perhaps
under
a
mistaken
impression
that
he
was
arriving
at
his
own
i
believe
the
rudder
wrong
said
diana
who
had
an
elementary
knowledge
of
matters
nautical
and
had
undertaken
to
steer
he
must
have
partly
unshipped
it
before
we
left
chistleton
it
not
the
slightest
use
i
wish
we
had
come
the
landlord
rowdy
hilarity
was
shortlived
and
rapidly
turned
to
pessimism
he
now
shipped
his
oars
and
regarded
his
frightened
passengers
with
a
baneful
glance
it
will
be
best
if
i
send
us
all
to
the
bottom
he
announced
oh
no
come
come
peters
i
sure
you
wo
do
that
said
miss
aubrey
persuasively
hoping
to
change
the
tenor
of
his
mood
again
i
do
anything
to
oblige
a
lady
was
the
maudlin
response
after
which
apparently
finding
the
situation
too
much
for
his
failing
senses
he
lay
down
comfortably
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
fell
asleep
it
was
safer
to
have
him
thus
out
of
harm
way
but
the
little
party
was
in
an
extremely
awkward
strait
none
of
them
except
diana
had
the
slightest
experience
of
rowing
and
the
rudder
was
undoubtedly
half
unshipped
katrine
and
diana
each
took
an
oar
but
their
efforts
were
of
a
most
amateur
description
and
they
could
make
little
progress
against
the
current
poor
miss
aubrey
sat
very
white
and
quiet
in
the
stern
giving
what
directions
she
could
though
she
was
practically
as
helpless
as
her
pupils
she
reproached
herself
keenly
for
having
exposed
them
to
such
danger
what
was
their
joy
on
rounding
a
bend
of
the
river
to
see
an
easel
on
the
bank
and
the
familiar
figure
of
freeman
working
at
a
canvas
they
all
halloed
loudly
to
him
for
help
and
he
soon
grasped
the
situation
can
you
manage
to
turn
her
and
paddle
to
the
bank
he
shouted
be
careful
that
right
never
mind
where
she
lands
just
get
her
ashore
anyhow
the
boat
after
wobbling
round
in
a
rather
unsteady
fashion
finally
ran
aground
in
a
bed
of
reeds
by
taking
off
his
shoes
and
stockings
freeman
contrived
to
wade
out
and
board
her
much
to
everyone
relief
we
thought
we
should
never
get
home
safely
said
miss
aubrey
peters
has
been
dreadful
he
threatened
to
send
us
to
the
bottom
we
were
thankful
when
he
collapsed
the
drunken
sot
exclaimed
freeman
looking
with
disgust
at
the
prostrate
figure
he
ought
to
have
his
licence
withdrawn
he
has
no
right
to
take
out
we
leave
him
where
he
is
and
row
you
back
to
heathwell
i
fetch
my
sketching
traps
oh
no
please
do
apologize
i
could
think
of
doing
otherwise
i
come
again
to
my
subject
i
in
no
hurry
to
finish
it
it
has
been
a
most
horrible
experience
said
miss
aubrey
to
the
girls
when
they
were
at
last
back
in
safety
at
heathwell
i
hope
stephen
peters
will
be
thoroughly
ashamed
of
himself
when
he
recovers
i
shall
never
hire
his
boat
again
and
shall
warn
other
people
not
to
trust
him
i
certainly
thought
we
were
going
to
be
upset
if
we
fortunately
come
across
freeman
i
do
know
what
might
have
happened
the
fairy
prince
always
turns
up
at
the
right
moment
whispered
diana
to
gladwin
causing
that
damsel
serious
inconvenience
for
she
wished
to
explode
but
was
obliged
to
suppress
such
mirth
in
the
presence
of
the
mistress

for

that
it
was
though
the
quiet
village
of

was
little
affected
by
the
european

echoes
of

often
reached

from

grieved
with

her

was
reported
missing
and
rejoiced
when
he
turned
out
to
be

was
added
to
the

honour
and
shared

anxiety
when
her
father
was
in
a
red
cross
hospital
as
a
practical
means
of
showing
their
patriotism
they
had
grown
vegetables
instead
of
flowers
in
their
school
gardens
and
sent
the
little
crops
of
peas
and
onions
and
cabbages
to
be
distributed
among
the
soldiers
and
sailors
wives
at
a
tipperary
club
in
carford
katrine
and
gwethyn
heard
rather
irregularly
from
hereward
they
looked
forward
to
his
letters
as
uncertain
but
delightful
events
and
sat
in
eager
expectation
every
morning
when
franklin
distributed
the
correspondence
news
that
he
was
wounded
came
as
a
sore
blow
though
a
letter
in
his
handwriting
followed
immediately
assuring
them
of
his
convalescence
in
a
base
hospital
i
am
doing
splendidly
he
wrote
and
hope
soon
to
be
at
those
huns
again
i
am
very
comfortable
here
and
as
jolly
as
a
cricket
so
bother
yourselves
over
me
there
a
fellow
in
the
bed
next
to
mine
who
says
he
knows
heathwell
we
got
talking
and
i
told
him
you
two
were
at
school
there
so
that
how
it
came
up
he
used
to
live
at
a
house
called
the
his
name
is
ledbury
an
awfully
decent
chap
in
the
canadian
rifles
he
had
rather
a
nasty
shrapnel
wound
and
will
probably
be
sent
home
on
sick
leave
we
a
jolly
lot
of
books
and
magazines
here
and
sometimes
there
a
concert
in
the
ward
i
can
tell
you
we
all
yell
the
choruses
to
the
songs
we
do
sound
much
like
invalids
when
katrine
and
gwethyn
had
finished
joying
over
the
happy
fact
that
hereward
seemed
to
be
in
no
danger
and
was
apparently
enjoying
himself
in
hospital
it
occurred
to
them
to
consider
the
item
of
news
which
he
had
mentioned
concerning
his
they
showed
the
letter
to
githa
she
was
immensely
excited
why
surely
it
must
be
uncle
frank
she
exclaimed
it
possibly
be
anyone
else
he
been
away
for
years
and
years
and
no
one
knew
what
had
become
of
him
i
have
seen
him
since
i
was
a
tiny
tot
and
i
should
remember
him
at
all
how
splendid
that
he
joined
the
canadians
oh
i
proud
to
have
a
relation
at
the
front
it
glorious
how
i
love
to
write
to
him
if
i
did
would
you
enclose
it
with
yours
to
your
brother
and
ask
him
to
give
it
to
him
of
course
it
might
be
uncle
frank
after
all
but
i
think
i
chance
it
write
straight
away
then
said
katrine
for
we
shall
be
posting
our
letters
to
hereward
i
lend
you
some
foreign
paper
oh
thanks
so
much
githa
spent
the
whole
of
her
recreation
time
at
her
desk
her
epistle
if
rather
a
funny
one
had
at
least
the
merit
of
being
spontaneous
for
she
put
exactly
what
came
into
her
head
at
the
moment
without
pausing
to
think
of
the
composition
dear
uncle
frank
at
least
i
not
at
all
sure
that
you
really
are
my
uncle
frank
but
i
do
hope
you
are
it
just
splendid
that
you
are
in
the
canadians
i
am
dreadfully
sorry
you
are
wounded
i
hope
you
will
soon
be
quite
well
again
if
you
come
back
to
england
do
please
come
and
see
me
that
is
to
say
if
you
are
really
uncle
frank
but
i
expect
you
are
i
want
to
see
you
most
dreadfully
cedric
and
i
have
often
talked
about
you
and
planned
that
we
would
go
and
live
with
you
cedric
tried
to
run
away
to
you
in
america
two
weeks
ago
but
it
is
a
good
thing
he
did
not
go
for
he
would
not
have
found
you
there
i
am
quite
sure
you
are
nice
and
i
should
so
like
to
see
you
nobody
is
living
at
the
now
and
it
looks
so
wretched
i
wish
you
would
come
and
live
there
and
ask
me
to
come
too
i
should
like
to
live
at
the
again
and
cedric
could
come
for
the
holidays
he
is
to
go
to
stay
with
a
gentleman
in
london
who
will
coach
him
for
the
naval
examination
i
must
stop
now
as
the
bell
is
just
going
to
ring
and
i
have
no
more
time
i
have
written
this
letter
in
school
from
your
loving
niece
githa
hamilton
i
hope
i
really
am
your
niece
after
all
githa
folded
and
addressed
her
letter
and
ran
to
give
it
into
safe
keeping
her
eyes
were
dancing
but
clouded
as
a
sudden
apprehension
struck
her
suppose
he
left
the
base
hospital
she
queried
hereward
will
send
it
to
him
he
easily
find
out
where
he
gone
i
undertake
it
shall
reach
him
somehow
what
a
trump
you
are
oh
i
wonder
if
it
is
really
and
truly
uncle
frank
or
only
somebody
else
i
wish
somebody
could
send
me
news
of
my
uncle
said
yvonne
de
boeck
wistfully
it
is
now
five
months
since
we
hear
is
he
alive
we
ask
ourselves
my
aunt
and
my
two
cousins
remain
yet
in
holland
yvonne
and
mélanie
had
been
at
aireyholme
since
the
preceding
november
and
though
when
they
arrived
they
could
speak
nothing
but
french
and
flemish
they
were
now
able
to
talk
english
quite
fluently
indeed
franklin
complained
that
they
had
picked
up
many
unnecessary
expressions
and
often
scolded
the
girls
for
teaching
them
so
much
slang
they
were
favourites
in
the
school
partly
because
everybody
was
so
sorry
for
them
but
also
because
they
were
really
jolly
friendly
children
and
had
adapted
themselves
so
readily
to
their
new
circumstances
yvonne
twelfth
birthday
was
celebrated
with
great
rejoicings
the
many
presents
she
received
and
the
english
iced
which
made
its
appearance
on
the
caused
her
little
round
rosy
face
to
beam
with
smiles
and
she
exclaimed
for
the
hundredth
time
mesdemoiselles
you
are
too
good
towards
me
yvonne
evinced
the
utmost
admiration
for
tony
nothing
delighted
her
more
than
to
help
with
his
toilet
to
brush
his
glossy
coat
wipe
his
paws
when
he
came
in
from
the
garden
and
assist
at
his
saturday
bath
she
was
even
found
tying
her
best
hair
ribbon
as
a
bow
on
his
collar
un
vrai
ange
she
would
declare
ecstatically
one
afternoon
when
most
of
the
girls
were
at
the
tennis
courts
yvonne
happened
to
stroll
to
the
bottom
of
the
garden
to
look
for
a
lost
ball
while
hunting
about
under
the
laurels
she
could
see
plainly
into
the
road
and
she
noticed
tony
trotting
through
the
gate
she
called
to
him
but
intent
on
errands
of
his
own
he
ignored
her
and
crossed
to
the
opposite
hedge
where
an
abandoned
bone
claimed
his
interest
he
was
still
busy
gnawing
it
and
growling
over
it
when
tramping
from
the
direction
of
the
village
appeared
an
old
ragman
with
a
sack
slung
over
his
back
as
he
passed
tony
he
stopped
and
set
his
bag
down
on
the
ground
apparently
to
rest
himself
though
he
glanced
keenly
round
with
such
a
strange
vigilant
look
on
his
face
that
it
immediately
attracted
yvonne
attention
hidden
under
the
laurels
she
watched
him
carefully
the
ragman
finding
himself
the
only
occupant
of
the
road
and
believing
he
was
safe
from
observation
opened
his
bag
and
drawing
out
a
piece
of
meat
offered
it
with
a
few
cajoling
words
to
the
unsuspecting
dog
tony
had
a
friendly
disposition
and
also
alack
a
tendency
towards
greediness
he
was
always
ready
for
something
tempting
he
left
his
bone
and
came
up
inquiringly
the
moment
he
was
within
reach
the
ragman
snatched
him
up
and
crammed
him
unceremoniously
into
the
sack
then
shouldered
him
and
walked
off
at
a
rapid
pace
it
was
all
done
so
quickly
that
tony
had
not
even
time
to
yelp
and
once
in
the
interior
of
the
sack
his
protests
were
smothered
to
suffocation
point
yvonne
overwhelmed
by
the
extreme
suddenness
and
unexpectedness
of
the
occurrence
could
only
give
a
gasp
of
horror
the
dog
had
seemed
to
vanish
as
if
by
a
conjuring
trick
luckily
she
was
possessed
of
a
certain
presence
of
mind
she
raced
up
the
shrubbery
found
george
the
garden
boy
and
poured
out
her
news
pointing
the
direction
in
which
the
ragman
had
gone
george
flung
down
his
spade
hurried
out
by
the
side
gate
and
ran
along
a
short
lane
that
led
to
the
road
by
thus
cutting
off
a
long
corner
he
almost
fell
into
the
arms
of
the
ragman
who
no
doubt
had
been
congratulating
himself
upon
the
speed
with
which
he
was
escaping
with
his
booty
and
who
certainly
did
not
expect
to
be
intercepted
in
so
prompt
a
manner
you
rascal
let
have
a
peep
inside
that
bag
exclaimed
george
and
dragging
the
sack
from
the
man
shoulder
he
opened
it
and
revealed
poor
tony
who
crawled
out
looking
the
most
astonished
dog
in
the
world
the
thief
did
not
wait
to
explain
matters
he
took
to
his
heels
leaving
his
sack
behind
him
the
thrilling
tale
of
tony
adventure
soon
spread
over
the
school
gwethyn
was
almost
in
hysterics
at
the
danger
her
pet
had
escaped
yvonne
proudly
conscious
that
for
once
she
had
acted
as
a
heroine
received
congratulations
on
all
sides
with
a
pretty
french
air
of
graciousness
coming
so
soon
after
the
attempted
burglary
the
episode
made
an
even
greater
stir
than
it
would
perhaps
otherwise
have
done
it
seemed
as
if
bad
characters
were
abroad
in
the
neighbourhood
and
property
must
be
guarded
with
unusual
vigilance
the
girls
had
allowed
their
fears
to
be
calmed
a
little
since
the
recent
midnight
alarm
but
now
their
anxiety
broke
forth
again
in
full
force
they
went
to
their
rooms
that
night
in
a
highly
nervous
condition
they
looked
carefully
underneath
their
beds
and
inside
their
wardrobes
to
make
sure
that
no
thieves
were
concealed
there
i
wish
franklin
would
let
us
have
sighed
rose
randall
directly
the
room
dark
i
know
i
shall
be
just
scared
to
death
suppose
a
man
climbed
in
through
the
window
i
more
afraid
of
someone
being
hidden
inside
the
house
waiting
for
his
opportunity
when
every
one
asleep
said
beatrix
bates
do
you
remember
that
dreadful
story
of
the
pedlar
pack
oh
yes
you
do
it
was
at
a
lonely
you
know
the
father
and
mother
were
away
for
the
night
and
at
dusk
a
pedlar
called
and
asked
if
he
might
leave
his
pack
there
till
the
next
day
the
girl
said
yes
so
he
carried
it
in
and
put
it
down
in
the
parlour
then
he
went
away
it
seemed
fearfully
heavy
so
the
girl
was
curious
and
went
to
look
at
it
and
then
beatrix
voice
was
impressive
with
horror
she
saw
it
move
she
guessed
at
once
that
a
man
was
concealed
inside
it
oh
a
big
parcel
came
by
the
carrier
i
saw
it
arrive
interrupted
prissie
yorke
in
visible
consternation
what
did
the
girl
do
with
the
pedlar
pack
asked
dona
matthews
she
stuck
a
knife
into
it
continued
beatrix
and
there
came
out
blood
oh
had
she
killed
him
but
at
this
most
sensational
point
of
the
narrative
miss
andrews
came
into
the
dormitory
scolded
the
girls
for
being
slow
in
getting
to
bed
and
absolutely
forbade
further
conversation
the
penalties
for
breaking
silence
rule
were
heavy
and
might
involve
suspension
of
tennis
on
the
following
day
so
beatrix
story
like
a
magazine
serial
must
perforce
be
left
to
be
continued
in
our
next
rose
could
not
help
thinking
about
it
as
she
lay
in
bed
she
wondered
if
groans
came
from
the
pack
and
what
the
girl
did
next
whether
she
ran
to
a
neighbour
for
help
or
called
the
dog
or
locked
the
parlour
door
or
went
out
of
her
mind
with
terror
it
would
have
driven
me
stark
staring
mad
she
shuddered
she
felt
too
nervous
to
go
to
sleep
all
the
tales
she
had
ever
heard
or
read
about
murders
and
burglaries
rushed
to
her
remembrance
with
startling
vividness
the
night
was
very
hot
and
the
window
of
course
was
wide
open
how
easy
it
would
be
for
somebody
to
creep
up
the
ivy
and
climb
across
the
sill
the
more
she
thought
about
it
the
more
terrified
she
grew
for
a
couple
of
hours
she
tossed
restlessly
lying
perfectly
still
every
now
and
then
so
as
to
listen
intently
were
those
stealthy
footsteps
in
the
passage
was
that
the
sound
of
a
file
on
the
window
below
how
could
beatrix
dona
and
prissie
sleep
so
peacefully
the
whole
house
was
absolutely
quiet
there
was
no
moon
so
it
was
perfectly
dark
again
rose
longed
for
a
it
would
be
reassuring
at
least
to
be
able
to
see
for
herself
that
the
room
held
no
intruder
what
oh
what
was
that
through
the
dead
silence
came
a
sound
like
a
she
sat
up
in
bed
trembling
in
every
limb
the
noise
had
wakened
the
other
girls
again
it
rang
through
the
quiet
so
near
that
they
were
convinced
it
must
be
in
the
room
dona
was
whimpering
with
terror
prissie
buried
her
head
in
the
bedclothes
beatrix
more
courageous
than
the
rest
stretched
out
her
hand
for
the
matches
that
lay
on
a
small
table
near
her
bed
and
lighted
a
candle
the
girls
looked
fearfully
round
fully
expecting
to
see
a
masked
figure
covering
them
with
a
revolver
there
was
nobody
at
all
they
stared
into
one
another
faces
a
third
time
close
at
hand
came
the
ringing
report
it
in
the
cupboard
quavered
rose
at
the
end
of
the
dormitory
two
steps
led
to
a
small
where
franklin
kept
spare
blankets
curtains
and
a
miscellaneous
assortment
of
articles
the
door
was
always
locked
and
the
girls
had
never
even
seen
inside
it
had
often
excited
their
curiosity
it
was
a
veritable
bluebeard
chamber
they
remembered
that
a
big
parcel
had
been
delivered
that
day
by
the
carrier
had
franklin
stored
it
in
the
cupboard
could
it
oh
horrible
idea
be
a
repetition
of
the
pedlar
pack
very
white
and
trembling
beatrix
got
out
of
bed
and
candle
in
hand
crossed
the
room
from
under
the
cupboard
door
down
the
steps
ran
a
stream
of
something
dark
and
red
the
shriek
which
she
uttered
was
followed
by
piercing
screams
from
her
companions
that
a
tragedy
was
being
enacted
in
the
they
had
not
a
shadow
of
doubt
at
any
moment
they
expected
the
door
to
open
and
the
murderer
to
show
himself
with
an
instinct
of
they
fled
from
the
dormitory
and
ran
along
the
passage
shouting
for
help
instantly
the
house
was
aroused
alarmed
faces
peeped
from
other
dormitories
timorous
voices
asked
what
was
the
matter
several
girls
began
to
weep
hysterically
franklin
armed
with
a
poker
came
hurrying
up
followed
closely
by
miss
andrews
grasping
a
hockey
stick
taking
the
candle
from
beatrix
the
principal
proceeded
to
no
the
girls
marvelling
at
her
courage
there
blood
oozing
out
of
the
cupboard
prissie
and
dona
assured
the
audience
in
the
passage
what
nonsense
nothing
of
the
sort
declared
franklin
firm
voice
as
after
a
moment
of
inspection
she
emerged
from
the
dormitory
what
has
really
happened
is
this
i
had
left
half
a
dozen
bottles
of
elder
syrup
there
the
very
hot
weather
has
no
doubt
caused
them
to
ferment
and
i
suppose
they
have
popped
their
corks
fetch
the
key
yvonne
and
novie
stop
crying
this
instant
nothing
whatever
to
be
frightened
about
franklin
supposition
proved
to
be
correct
when
the
cupboard
was
unlocked
three
corkless
bottles
and
a
sticky
pool
of
elder
syrup
were
revealed
miss
andrews
wiped
up
the
mess
with
a
towel
and
carried
the
bottles
downstairs
removing
also
the
three
which
were
intact
in
case
of
further
accidents
the
general
alarm
had
changed
to
mirth
in
their
revulsion
of
feeling
the
girls
laughed
uproariously
at
their
scare
the
elder
syrup
was
used
in
to
doctor
colds
and
they
were
rather
fond
of
it
it
had
never
played
such
a
gruesome
prank
before
it
a
good
thing
we
did
ring
the
school
bell
again
and
send
for
white
said
franklin
we
should
have
looked
extremely
foolish
if
he
and
half
the
village
had
arrived
but
how
can
you
tell
whether
it
a
real
scare
or
a
false
one
objected
dona
who
felt
that
there
was
ample
excuse
for
their
alarm
the
principal
however
was
not
disposed
to
argue
that
point
and
packed
the
girls
back
to
their
rooms
in
half
an
hour
even
rose
randall
was
sleeping
the
sleep
of
the
just
chapter
xvii
the
wishing
well
ledbury
feeling
rather
doubtful
whether
hawkins
tuition
had
been
up
to
the
required
standard
had
decided
to
send
cedric
to
receive
some
special
coaching
before
going
in
for
his
naval
examination
the
boy
departed
to
london
in
high
spirits
leaving
his
sister
visibly
depressed
at
his
absence
ledbury
had
lately
been
far
more
sympathetic
with
githa
and
noticing
that
the
girl
seemed
to
be
moping
she
suggested
inviting
a
to
spend
friday
to
monday
with
her
her
aunt
had
never
before
made
such
an
amazing
proposition
much
as
githa
would
have
liked
to
entertain
an
occasional
visitor
she
had
not
dared
to
ask
to
be
allowed
to
do
so
she
looked
so
utterly
delighted
that
ledbury
who
generally
saw
her
most
undemonstrative
side
was
frankly
astonished
it
good
for
you
to
make
friends
of
your
own
age
she
remarked
tell
me
which
girl
you
would
like
to
have
and
i
will
write
a
note
to
mrs
franklin
githa
choice
promptly
fell
on
gwethyn
the
invitation
was
sent
and
franklin
after
an
interview
in
the
study
gave
majestic
permission
for
its
acceptance
the
proposed
visit
caused
much
amazement
in
the
school
and
ledbury
had
been
looked
upon
rather
as
bogeys
by
the
girls
githa
had
been
so
guarded
in
her
information
about
her
home
life
that
it
was
always
presumed
she
was
unhappy
how
she
spent
her
spare
hours
she
had
never
divulged
her
doings
away
from
aireyholme
had
always
been
more
or
less
of
a
mystery
i
hope
you
have
a
tolerable
time
said
gwethyn
friends
to
her
in
private
their
tone
clearly
expressing
anticipation
of
the
contrary
i
suppose
ledbury
most
frightfully
strict
you
have
to
be
and
prism
personified
i
worry
through
somehow
without
shocking
her
more
than
i
can
help
returned
gwethyn
it
ever
so
decent
of
her
to
ask
me
well
of
course
you
could
refuse
decided
her
chums
if
gwethyn
had
any
misgivings
upon
the
subject
the
sight
of
pathetic
eagerness
was
sufficient
to
nerve
her
to
brave
a
hundred
strict
and
particular
aunts
the
poor
little
toadstool
had
been
so
friendless
that
it
was
an
immense
event
in
her
life
to
be
able
to
bring
a
companion
back
with
her
on
friday
afternoon
gwethyn
had
really
grown
to
like
her
so
the
visit
was
one
of
inclination
and
not
as
her
chums
insisted
sheer
philanthropy
perhaps
a
little
curiosity
was
mixed
up
with
it
she
would
certainly
be
the
first
aireyholme
girl
to
see
the
ledburys
at
home
there
was
much
debating
as
to
whether
tony
should
accompany
them
but
in
the
end
they
reluctantly
decided
to
leave
him
at
school
he
could
not
keep
pace
with
bicycles
and
it
was
almost
impossible
to
ride
and
nurse
him
so
that
to
take
him
would
necessitate
wheeling
the
machines
the
whole
way
he
possessed
such
a
host
of
admirers
that
they
could
not
honestly
flatter
themselves
that
he
would
pine
for
their
society
yvonne
would
be
only
too
proud
to
give
him
his
saturday
bath
and
he
could
sleep
on
katrine
bed
gwethyn
luggage
was
sent
by
the
carrier
and
when
school
was
over
on
friday
afternoon
she
and
githa
started
off
to
cycle
gwethyn
laughed
as
she
reminded
her
companion
how
she
and
katrine
had
first
approached
the
gables
on
the
morning
of
their
unauthorized
ride
the
house
which
from
the
back
had
looked
like
a
farm
proved
a
very
different
building
when
viewed
from
the
front
it
was
a
handsome
modern
residence
with
beautifully
kept
grounds
and
immaculately
rolled
gravel
drive
ledbury
received
gwethyn
very
graciously
if
her
manner
was
not
expansive
she
evidently
intended
to
be
kind
she
was
not
at
her
ease
with
young
girls
that
was
plainly
to
be
seen
but
she
made
some
efforts
at
conversation
to
which
gwethyn
responded
nobly
tea
served
in
the
garden
was
rather
a
solemn
business
for
githa
scarcely
spoke
once
before
her
aunt
and
there
were
long
pauses
of
silence
during
which
ledbury
seemed
conscientiously
endeavouring
to
think
of
some
fresh
remark
to
address
to
her
youthful
visitor
all
three
were
secretly
relieved
when
the
ordeal
was
over
and
ledbury
went
into
the
house
leaving
her
niece
to
entertain
her
friend
alone
githa
had
much
to
show
to
gwethyn
and
they
adjourned
at
once
to
inspect
the
menagerie
of
pets
which
she
kept
in
a
disused
stable
gwethyn
loved
animals
and
was
ready
to
wax
enthusiastic
over
the
waltzing
mice
the
the
rabbits
the
and
the
formicarium
with
its
wonderful
nest
of
ants
the
latter
especially
fascinated
her
when
githa
removed
the
cover
and
she
was
able
to
watch
the
busy
little
workers
running
hither
and
thither
at
their
domestic
operations
how
do
you
feed
them
she
asked
i
put
honey
inside
this
doorway
and
water
inside
the
other
that
all
they
need
rolf
the
collie
who
had
given
gwethyn
so
churlish
a
reception
on
her
former
visit
was
now
ready
to
make
friends
and
a
grey
stable
cat
also
condescended
to
be
petted
and
stroked
githa
took
a
deep
interest
in
poultry
and
was
anxious
to
show
the
flock
of
young
turkeys
the
goslings
the
chickens
and
ducks
all
of
which
she
had
helped
to
rear
of
course
i
ca
look
after
them
altogether
when
i
at
school
all
day
but
i
get
up
very
early
so
that
i
can
give
them
their
morning
meal
and
i
feed
them
in
the
evening
too
they
know
me
as
well
as
they
know
tom
i
just
love
taking
care
of
them
when
i
grow
up
i
like
to
have
a
poultry
farm
gwethyn
had
to
see
githa
garden
the
seat
she
had
made
in
the
the
field
where
she
often
found
nature
specimens
to
bring
to
school
and
the
bushes
where
the
nightingale
sang
in
spring
indoors
also
there
were
her
books
and
picture
to
be
inspected
and
some
fancy
work
upon
which
she
had
been
busy
and
ledbury
dined
at
seven
and
the
two
girls
had
supper
by
themselves
in
the
i
do
my
lessons
here
in
the
evenings
githa
explained
but
thank
goodness
we
none
what
would
you
like
to
do
now
shall
we
play
tennis
or
go
for
a
walk
down
the
fields
gwethyn
knowing
from
school
experience
that
githa
tennis
capabilities
were
not
of
a
very
high
order
chose
the
walk
it
was
a
greater
change
for
her
she
loved
exploring
and
aireyholme
rules
did
not
give
her
as
much
scope
in
that
direction
as
she
would
have
wished
ledbury
owned
some
of
the
land
near
the
gables
and
githa
proposed
that
she
should
take
her
friend
to
see
the
church
and
that
they
could
then
come
back
through
her
uncle
plantations
it
was
a
lovely
summer
evening
with
a
fresh
little
breeze
that
was
most
exhilarating
after
the
heat
of
the
day
they
strolled
down
a
lane
where
wild
strawberries
were
still
in
their
prime
and
could
be
found
for
careful
searching
through
cornfields
and
across
a
pasture
then
down
a
deep
lane
a
very
tangle
of
traveller
joy
their
way
led
to
the
church
the
object
of
their
expedition
it
was
a
beautiful
old
norman
building
standing
solitary
and
apart
with
no
hamlet
or
even
a
farm
near
to
it
it
had
a
neglected
appearance
for
the
porch
was
unswept
the
walk
a
mass
of
weeds
and
grass
grew
high
over
the
graves
it
seems
such
a
lonely
place
for
a
church
said
githa
i
often
wonder
if
there
used
to
be
a
village
here
in
the
middle
ages
it
a
chapel
of
ease
now
to
elphinstone
we
only
have
service
here
on
sunday
afternoons
except
on
the
first
sunday
in
the
month
not
many
people
come
only
a
few
of
the
farmers
about
i
wish
i
could
take
you
inside
but
the
locked
and
the
clerk
lives
too
far
off
for
us
to
go
and
borrow
the
keys
by
peeping
through
the
windows
they
could
see
the
ancient
carved
choir
stalls
and
some
tattered
flags
placed
as
memorials
of
battles
a
few
sculptured
tombs
with
knights
in
effigy
were
also
dimly
discernible
in
the
transept
they
belong
to
the
denham
family
explained
githa
they
used
to
be
the
great
people
of
the
neighbourhood
once
and
they
still
own
malbury
hall
that
quaint
old
place
with
the
moat
round
it
no
they
do
live
there
it
let
to
some
americans
the
denhams
are
too
poor
now
to
keep
it
up
this
is
their
coat
of
arms
over
the
porch
a
griffin
holding
a
sword
once
they
used
to
come
to
church
with
all
their
followers
it
must
have
been
a
grand
sight
i
often
wish
i
could
shut
my
eyes
and
catch
a
vision
of
it
they
tied
their
horses
to
those
the
rings
are
still
there
then
they
would
come
clattering
with
their
spurs
up
the
paved
path
and
the
ladies
would
come
too
with
little
pages
to
hold
up
their
genoese
velvet
trains
and
the
very
same
bell
would
be
ringing
that
rings
now
and
perhaps
some
of
them
would
sit
in
the
same
places
that
we
do
they
were
all
baptized
and
married
and
buried
here
and
do
they
haunt
the
church
asked
gwethyn
with
a
little
shudder
many
people
say
they
do
i
do
think
anyone
cares
to
come
here
after
dark
sir
ralph
is
supposed
to
walk
and
lady
margaret
they
go
down
that
path
towards
the
wishing
well
really
a
well
queried
gwethyn
so
folks
say
it
very
very
ancient
shall
we
go
and
look
at
it
oh
we
sha
meet
sir
ralph
and
lady
margaret
do
be
afraid
it
hardly
dusk
yet
githa
led
the
way
along
an
overgrown
little
path
among
the
bushes
in
a
corner
of
the
churchyard
overshadowed
by
thick
trees
lay
the
well
a
pool
of
water
about
six
feet
square
with
walls
like
a
bath
a
few
broken
pieces
of
masonry
lay
about
it
sometimes
called
the
black
friar
well
continued
githa
still
acting
as
guide
he
lived
during
the
great
black
death
in
the
reign
of
edward
iii
the
church
was
closed
then
because
the
rector
and
most
of
his
flock
had
died
of
the
plague
but
one
of
the
dominican
friars
used
to
come
from
cressington
abbey
and
preach
in
the
churchyard
to
the
few
people
who
were
left
and
baptize
the
babies
in
this
well
there
was
a
sort
of
little
chapel
over
it
once
but
that
supposed
to
have
tumbled
down
long
before
the
time
of
the
plague
perhaps
even
before
the
church
was
built
what
have
sir
ralph
and
lady
margaret
to
do
with
it
did
they
die
of
the
plague
asked
gwethyn
no
that
quite
another
story
they
lived
in
the
time
of
the
civil
wars
they
were
on
the
side
of
the
king
and
after
charles
execution
sir
ralph
was
considered
a
rebel
by
the
commonwealth
a
troop
of
parliamentarian
soldiers
was
sent
to
arrest
him
they
stopped
at
cressington
abbey
which
was
then
the
country
house
of
sir
guy
meldrum
a
roundhead
his
wife
dame
alice
was
cousin
to
sir
ralph
and
though
of
course
they
were
on
opposite
sides
she
was
anxious
to
save
him
she
did
not
dare
to
write
him
a
letter
or
even
to
send
him
a
verbal
message
but
she
wrapped
a
feather
in
a
piece
of
paper
and
made
a
run
across
the
fields
with
it
to
malbury
hall
while
she
delayed
the
troopers
as
long
as
she
could
at
cressington
people
in
those
troublous
times
were
very
quick
at
taking
hints
sir
ralph
guessed
that
he
had
better
fly
but
the
difficulty
was
where
to
go
no
one
would
be
anxious
to
receive
him
and
get
into
trouble
with
the
parliament
in
desperation
he
fled
to
the
church
and
hid
himself
in
the
crypt
underneath
the
chancel
it
was
a
horrible
dark
gruesome
place
to
take
refuge
in
and
of
course
he
needed
food
while
he
was
there
the
troopers
had
established
themselves
at
malbury
hall
and
kept
close
watch
but
lady
margaret
his
wife
used
to
steal
out
at
night
and
go
to
visit
her
husband
in
the
churchyard
it
must
have
been
terrible
for
her
to
walk
there
all
alone
and
she
was
afraid
of
being
followed
by
the
soldiers
her
fears
were
only
too
well
justified
in
spite
of
all
her
precautions
the
captain
of
the
troopers
was
too
clever
for
her
one
night
she
stole
to
the
crypt
as
usual
bringing
food
and
wine
for
her
husband
and
as
all
seemed
safe
and
quiet
he
came
up
into
the
churchyard
to
get
a
little
fresh
air
and
exercise
they
were
walking
together
along
the
path
that
leads
to
the
well
when
suddenly
there
was
a
shout
and
they
found
themselves
surrounded
by
the
band
of
troopers
their
captain
had
discovered
that
someone
left
the
house
at
night
and
had
kept
watch
with
extra
care
he
had
caused
his
men
to
tie
cloths
over
their
boots
so
that
they
could
walk
very
silently
and
when
lady
margaret
was
seen
vanishing
down
the
garden
they
had
followed
her
they
tried
to
make
sir
ralph
prisoner
but
he
was
determined
not
to
be
taken
alive
and
fought
desperately
with
his
back
to
the
little
bit
of
stone
wall
left
near
the
well
one
man
had
no
chance
against
a
troop
of
soldiers
however
and
he
was
soon
despatched
when
they
found
he
was
dead
they
laid
him
down
beside
the
well
and
left
him
until
they
could
return
by
daylight
and
carry
his
body
away
they
arrived
the
next
day
with
a
stretcher
and
there
lying
close
by
his
side
with
her
arms
flung
round
him
they
found
lady
margaret
quite
mad
they
treated
her
gently
and
took
her
back
to
malbury
hall
and
she
lived
there
many
years
but
she
never
recovered
her
senses
and
whenever
she
could
escape
from
her
keepers
she
would
try
to
run
by
night
to
the
churchyard
they
guarded
her
as
carefully
as
they
could
but
she
was
cunning
and
at
last
she
managed
to
evade
them
and
get
a
start
when
they
discovered
her
loss
they
followed
her
and
found
her
lying
drowned
at
the
bottom
of
the
well
they
buried
her
beside
her
husband
in
the
transept
and
a
beautiful
monument
was
erected
over
their
grave
i
do
wonder
they
supposed
to
haunt
the
place
commented
gwethyn
i
vote
we
go
this
churchyard
is
too
spooky
for
my
taste
i
do
want
to
meet
either
cavaliers
or
roundheads
thank
you
you
must
go
before
trying
your
luck
at
the
well
said
githa
everybody
who
comes
here
goes
through
the
ceremony
it
most
ancient
what
have
i
got
to
do
will
it
raise
ghosts
certainly
not
you
utter
a
wish
then
you
throw
a
stone
into
the
water
and
count
the
bubbles
that
rise
if
they
are
an
odd
number
you
get
the
wish
but
if
they
even
you
wo
all
right
here
goes
i
wish
mother
may
bring
me
back
an
australian
cockatoo
from
sydney
what
a
splash
now
how
many
bubbles
oh
what
a
sell
i
suppose
she
wo
though
i
asked
her
in
several
of
my
letters
it
your
turn
now
what
are
you
going
to
wish
that
some
time
i
may
go
and
live
at
the
grange
again
my
stone
went
in
with
a
plop
did
it
o
jubilate
i
shall
get
it
please
invite
me
when
you
settled
there
you
bet
i
will
now
i
not
going
to
stay
in
this
haunted
hole
two
seconds
longer
proclaimed
gwethyn
it
growing
ever
so
dark
and
sir
ralph
and
lady
margaret
may
come
promenading
out
any
time
i
rather
have
burglars
than
ghosts
we
go
across
the
stile
here
and
take
a
short
cut
home
through
the
plantation
agreed
githa
leading
the
way
chapter
xviii
a
discovery
it
was
indeed
high
time
for
the
girls
to
go
home
the
sun
had
set
nearly
an
hour
ago
and
the
dusk
was
creeping
on
to
that
particular
stage
when
the
law
of
the
land
requires
cyclists
to
light
up
they
climbed
the
stile
and
plunged
into
the
thick
copse
of
young
oaks
and
beeches
it
was
dim
and
mysterious
and
gloomy
under
the
trees
a
slight
breeze
had
arisen
and
the
rustle
of
the
leaves
sounded
like
gentle
footsteps
it
rather
spooky
and
creepy
said
gwethyn
i
wish
there
were
a
moon
there
is
but
it
a
new
one
i
saw
it
a
tiny
thin
crescent
when
we
were
in
the
lane
do
you
feel
rather
like
the
babes
in
the
wood
it
getting
darker
and
darker
if
we
met
the
two
villains
i
should
certainly
for
fear
we
not
likely
to
meet
anyone
it
uncle
wood
i
thought
i
heard
footsteps
i
think
it
nothing
but
the
wind
rustling
the
branches
oh
no
githa
it
is
somebody
do
stop
and
listen
i
can
hear
voices
and
they
coming
towards
us
suppose
they
poachers
let
us
hide
quickly
behind
these
bushes
and
let
them
pass
without
seeing
us
i
wish
we
brought
rolf
since
the
midnight
adventure
at
school
gwethyn
was
disposed
to
be
much
alarmed
at
all
doubtful
characters
and
would
have
gone
considerably
out
of
her
way
to
avoid
a
tramp
she
seized
githa
arm
and
drew
her
aside
now
in
nervous
haste
and
together
the
pair
crouched
behind
a
thick
sheltering
group
of
bramble
bushes
in
the
dim
light
they
were
just
able
to
distinguish
the
features
of
the
wayfarers
who
advanced
one
was
unmistakably
bob
gartley
and
the
other
they
recognized
as
a
carter
whom
they
had
sometimes
noticed
hanging
about
the
dragon
the
errand
of
the
two
men
seemed
of
a
doubtful
nature
and
might
well
justify
suspicions
they
stopped
opposite
the
very
bush
where
the
girls
were
concealed
and
taking
various
pieces
of
wire
and
string
out
of
their
pockets
commenced
to
set
traps
with
much
care
and
a
skill
worthy
of
a
better
cause
they
were
so
near
that
the
unwilling
listeners
behind
the
brambles
could
overhear
every
word
that
was
spoken
things
are
the
same
as
they
used
to
be
remarked
bob
gartley
sulkily
it
hard
work
for
a
poor
man
to
get
even
a
rabbit
nowadays
look
out
albert
you
spoiling
that
noose
it
was
very
different
when
i
was
a
boy
returned
albert
ledbury
did
own
the
shooting
in
these
woods
then
and
they
were
so
strictly
kept
one
had
an
easy
chance
of
a
pheasant
or
two
aye
it
all
belonged
to
the
grange
and
it
always
went
with
the
house
in
those
days
pity
it
changed
hands
yes
old
ledbury
never
used
to
trouble
much
and
if
one
took
a
walk
in
his
woods
there
was
no
particular
questions
asked
this
lawyer
chap
too
sharp
he
got
more
than
his
share
when
the
old
man
died
everyone
in
the
village
said
it
was
a
shame
those
two
hamilton
children
should
have
been
overlooked
and
left
nothing
some
folks
went
so
far
as
to
say
there
must
have
been
a
later
will
and
gave
wilfred
the
credit
of
suppressing
it
there
was
a
lot
of
talk
at
the
time
it
seems
there
was
a
big
sum
of
money
thousands
of
pounds
it
was
that
old
ledbury
was
known
to
have
received
only
a
day
or
so
before
his
death
it
had
been
paid
over
to
him
in
notes
he
had
put
it
in
the
bank
and
after
his
death
it
never
turned
up
he
was
a
queer
chap
was
old
ledbury
fond
of
gambling
and
the
tale
went
that
he
must
have
lost
it
at
play
now
you
speak
of
it
i
heard
some
talk
in
the
village
myself
they
say
old
ledbury
was
a
miser
as
well
as
a
gambler
and
hoarded
things
like
a
magpie
it
was
a
queer
thing
what
he
done
with
that
money
it
was
uncommon
queer
replied
bob
and
between
you
and
me
albert
i
could
tell
you
a
thing
or
two
about
that
what
do
you
mean
something
i
saw
once
admitted
bob
cautiously
but
so
far
it
not
been
worth
my
while
to
let
on
about
it
and
i
ai
been
able
to
take
advantage
of
it
myself
i
sometimes
think
if
i
a
pal
now
you
and
me
was
always
thick
bob
put
in
albert
eagerly
i
dare
say
but
you
go
clacking
like
an
old
hen
when
you
a
drop
of
drink
in
you
i
would
touch
aught
leastways
not
more
than
my
usual
pint
at
supper
if
i
thought
you
could
keep
a
still
tongue
the
two
of
us
might
manage
a
pretty
big
deal
it
be
a
risky
enough
job
but
i
know
you
stop
at
a
trifle
not
me
chuckled
albert
well
i
do
mind
tellin
you
that
i
was
peepin
in
under
the
blinds
at
the
grange
on
the
very
night
before
old
ledbury
died
and
what
did
ye
see
never
you
mind
what
i
saw
exactly
but
all
they
panels
are
solid
like
the
rest
there
be
one
as
takes
out
wheer
ai
i
tellin
you
in
the
room
at
the
grange
plump
opposite
the
fireplace
it
were
there
a
knob
as
twists
look
here
if
you
that
noose
proper
why
ca
you
be
comin
do
you
expect
me
to
be
waitin
on
you
same
as
if
you
was
captain
gordon
if
we
ai
quick
the
keepers
will
be
comin
that
morris
always
takes
a
round
about
dark
that
what
brought
me
out
so
early
all
right
but
as
you
was
grunted
albert
his
voice
sinking
to
a
murmur
as
he
rose
and
followed
his
estimable
friend
farther
into
the
wood
where
more
snares
might
be
set
with
advantage
during
the
progress
of
their
conversation
when
they
judged
the
two
men
to
be
at
a
safe
distance
githa
and
gwethyn
emerged
from
behind
the
bush
and
scurried
away
along
the
path
as
fast
as
the
gathering
dusk
would
permit
so
anxious
were
they
to
get
out
of
the
wood
that
neither
spoke
a
word
until
they
had
reached
the
farther
side
and
climbing
the
fence
found
themselves
once
more
in
the
fields
below
the
gables
it
was
the
gartley
children
father
exclaimed
gwethyn
taking
githa
arm
not
so
much
for
protection
as
for
a
sense
of
companionship
in
the
dark
i
always
heard
he
a
dreadful
poacher
i
think
such
a
hateful
insolent
kind
of
man
i
thankful
he
did
see
us
so
am
i
it
will
serve
them
right
if
the
keepers
catch
them
could
you
understand
what
they
were
talking
about
you
mean
what
they
said
about
grandfather
and
the
grange
it
was
most
mysterious
gartley
certainly
dropped
a
hint
about
a
panel
yes
but
i
could
make
out
the
rest
or
what
he
wanted
albert
to
help
him
with
you
do
think
that
your
grandfather
could
have
hidden
some
money
in
the
panelling
and
that
bob
gartley
saw
him
do
it
if
he
did
the
money
certainly
would
be
there
now
considering
the
house
has
been
empty
for
about
three
years
gartley
must
have
had
every
opportunity
of
going
in
and
taking
it
and
i
scarcely
think
he
be
restrained
by
conscientious
scruples
hardly
no
there
was
something
more
some
secret
that
he
did
want
to
tell
even
to
if
only
they
had
gone
away
just
at
that
identical
minute
groaned
gwethyn
it
was
too
tantalizing
when
we
seemed
on
the
very
point
of
learning
something
it
must
be
important
or
he
would
make
such
a
mystery
of
it
and
talk
about
its
being
to
his
advantage
do
you
think
his
wife
knows
and
that
we
could
get
her
to
tell
us
no
she
too
much
afraid
of
him
but
if
we
tried
bribery
and
corruption
he
himself
might
perhaps
be
induced
to
part
with
the
information
he
spoke
of
a
job
which
certainly
means
something
dishonest
in
that
case
i
sure
he
would
reveal
a
word
if
we
were
to
tell
the
police
could
they
make
him
confess
no
he
simply
deny
everything
flatly
then
what
can
we
do
nothing
as
regards
him
i
afraid
we
might
as
well
investigate
at
the
grange
though
shall
we
get
up
early
and
ride
over
on
our
bikes
before
breakfast
i
do
suppose
we
shall
find
anything
but
if
you
like
we
go
and
look
i
your
man
responded
gwethyn
eagerly
of
the
two
girls
gwethyn
was
the
more
excited
her
romantic
imagination
at
once
made
her
plan
all
sorts
of
delightful
possibilities
they
were
to
find
an
immense
fortune
at
the
grange
of
which
her
friend
would
be
the
heiress
who
knew
what
treasures
might
be
hoarded
somewhere
behind
the
panelling
githa
whose
natural
disposition
was
not
sanguine
and
who
had
already
tasted
some
of
the
hard
experiences
of
life
shook
her
head
at
her
golden
dreams
and
stuck
to
her
former
contention
if
bob
gartley
was
aware
that
money
was
hidden
in
the
old
house
he
certainly
would
not
have
let
it
remain
there
for
long
nevertheless
githa
was
anxious
to
explore
just
to
satisfy
herself
that
there
was
really
nothing
to
find
she
would
not
admit
the
weakness
however
and
pretended
that
the
early
morning
expedition
was
a
concession
to
her
friend
impatience
the
girls
decided
not
to
tell
a
word
to
anybody
of
what
they
had
overheard
they
did
not
mention
to
ledbury
that
they
had
been
in
the
plantation
and
githa
when
reproved
by
her
aunt
for
staying
out
so
late
merely
explained
that
she
had
been
showing
gwethyn
the
church
with
an
injunction
to
keep
to
the
garden
in
future
after
supper
ledbury
passed
the
matter
over
githa
was
a
habitual
early
riser
but
next
morning
she
excelled
herself
and
called
her
friend
almost
as
soon
as
it
was
light
at
five
they
were
getting
their
bicycles
from
the
stable
githa
mindful
of
her
pets
healthy
appetites
chalked
a
notice
on
the
door
asking
the
gardener
to
feed
them
as
soon
as
he
arrived
i
have
time
now
but
they
may
be
getting
hungry
for
their
breakfasts
before
we
are
back
she
said
and
the
fowls
ought
to
be
let
out
tom
will
attend
to
them
i
know
the
ride
through
the
fresh
morning
air
was
very
pleasant
the
girls
felt
so
fit
that
they
raced
along
making
nothing
of
hills
and
covered
the
distance
in
record
time
the
dew
was
still
heavy
on
the
grass
as
they
went
up
the
drive
to
the
empty
old
house
since
cedric
sojourn
there
neither
had
been
near
the
place
and
apparently
nobody
else
had
disturbed
the
solitude
in
spite
of
agents
tempting
advertisements
no
possible
tenant
had
even
come
to
look
at
its
attractions
the
vestibule
window
still
stood
open
an
enterprising
piece
of
clematis
had
made
entrance
and
had
grown
at
least
a
yard
inside
and
a
robin
was
flying
about
in
the
passage
the
girls
went
at
once
to
the
wainscoted
room
that
had
been
old
ledbury
library
now
i
wonder
if
bob
gartley
was
telling
the
truth
or
not
queried
githa
he
said
opposite
the
fireplace
and
knob
that
twists
said
gwethyn
tapping
the
panels
critically
with
her
knuckles
what
does
he
mean
by
knobs
there
are
any
unless
he
called
these
rosettes
in
the
scrollwork
knobs
part
of
the
panelling
was
beautifully
carved
with
a
twisting
conventional
design
no
part
of
it
protruded
sufficiently
to
merit
the
title
of
knob
but
at
intervals
there
were
round
objects
possibly
intended
to
represent
roses
they
did
not
look
encouraging
but
beginning
with
the
end
near
the
window
githa
carefully
tested
each
one
the
first
eleven
were
part
and
parcel
of
the
solid
woodwork
but
the
twelfth
moved
it
turned
round
fairly
easily
when
she
twisted
it
evidently
unlatching
some
catch
for
the
panel
below
fell
open
like
a
door
revealing
a
small
hole
or
cupboard
not
altogether
surprised
the
girls
peeped
eagerly
inside
nothing
as
i
thought
exclaimed
githa
only
a
thick
coat
of
dust
i
never
imagined
there
would
be
anything
certainly
not
if
bob
gartley
knew
anything
of
it
no
it
hardly
seemed
likely
faltered
gwethyn
but
i
disappointed
all
the
same
move
just
an
inch
and
let
me
put
in
my
hand
oh
yes
i
know
it
useless
but
i
an
obstinate
person
and
like
my
own
way
i
want
to
feel
the
inside
it
uncommonly
dirty
and
it
absolutely
empty
no
what
this
why
githa
look
i
actually
have
found
something
after
all
the
object
which
gwethyn
had
discovered
in
the
dust
of
the
cupboard
behind
the
panels
was
neither
beautiful
nor
important
only
a
small
key
of
such
an
ordinary
pattern
that
it
evidently
could
not
claim
any
interest
on
the
score
of
antiquity
not
much
of
a
find
i
afraid
she
mourned
just
something
that
has
been
overlooked
when
the
place
was
cleared
out
i
do
suppose
the
panel
was
a
very
dead
secret
it
opens
so
easily
that
the
servants
would
probably
find
it
when
they
polished
the
woodwork
i
never
knew
of
it
said
githa
i
wonder
how
bob
gartley
knew
of
it
though
and
why
he
seemed
to
think
it
rather
a
valuable
piece
of
information
yes
that
decidedly
puzzling
except
that
sometimes
uneducated
people
like
to
make
an
absurd
mystery
over
simple
things
just
to
increase
their
own
importance
perhaps
he
wanted
to
rouse
albert
curiosity
he
succeeded
in
rousing
ours
at
any
rate
and
we
have
gratified
it
a
key
without
a
lock
is
a
rather
useless
discovery
i
shall
take
it
though
and
keep
it
carefully
in
case
it
ever
turns
out
to
be
of
any
use
well
we
found
the
precious
panel
but
no
fortune
it
rather
a
swindle
only
exactly
what
i
expected
i
wanted
to
come
just
for
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
there
was
nothing
we
had
a
ripping
ride
at
any
rate
yes
and
we
better
be
going
home
again
now
come
along
and
get
our
bikes
chapter
xix
an
accident
after
breakfast
githa
and
gwethyn
having
the
whole
of
saturday
morning
at
their
disposal
resolved
to
go
mushrooming
the
warm
weather
had
brought
out
a
fairly
plentiful
crop
and
they
hoped
by
diligent
searching
to
be
able
to
fill
at
least
a
small
can
the
pastures
were
generally
scoured
early
by
people
from
the
village
who
sold
the
mushrooms
in
carford
at
a
good
price
we
ought
to
have
thought
of
it
first
thing
when
we
were
riding
to
the
grange
said
githa
i
afraid
we
shall
find
the
best
places
have
been
cleared
to
get
mushrooms
one
almost
has
to
sit
up
all
night
and
watch
them
grow
everybody
so
keen
on
them
just
now
still
i
think
i
know
of
one
or
two
fields
that
are
worth
going
to
on
the
chance
that
no
one
else
has
been
there
already
the
meadows
which
githa
proposed
to
visit
lay
near
the
river
about
between
the
gables
and
heathwell
the
prospect
of
finding
mushrooms
there
was
rendered
more
promising
on
this
particular
day
because
most
of
the
village
children
were
helping
to
gather
the
bean
harvest
and
would
therefore
be
busily
employed
elsewhere
the
july
heat
was
already
ripening
some
of
the
corn
and
before
long
the
reapers
would
be
at
work
it
a
pity
gleaning
has
gone
so
completely
said
gwethyn
it
must
have
looked
so
delightfully
romantic
none
of
the
village
people
are
half
so
picturesque
as
those
in
the
old
pictures
even
gartley
wears
a
dilapidated
but
still
fashionable
hat
which
she
bought
at
a
rummage
sale
and
blundell
daughter
makes
hay
in
the
relics
of
a
once
gorgeous
evening
blouse
and
a
voile
skirt
instead
of
a
print
and
striped
petticoat
i
suppose
people
must
keep
pace
with
the
times
but
from
an
artistic
point
of
view
i
wish
their
clothes
were
more
suitable
to
their
occupations
it
no
use
mourning
over
vanished
customs
we
do
defy
the
fashions
and
appear
in
sir
joshua
reynolds
costumes
granny
blundell
at
any
rate
is
picturesque
in
her
apron
and
she
made
a
splendid
model
for
katrine
picture
of
the
old
spice
cupboard
the
cupboard
she
stolen
from
you
no
no
she
bought
it
fairly
and
squarely
from
stubbs
as
i
told
you
before
i
glad
for
her
to
have
it
since
i
ca
have
it
myself
how
hot
it
getting
i
believe
i
tired
with
going
out
riding
so
early
i
shall
feel
in
better
spirits
when
i
found
some
mushrooms
a
penny
for
the
first
who
sees
any
and
who
to
give
the
penny
why
the
other
of
course
suppose
one
sees
the
mushroom
and
the
other
picks
it
what
then
oh
i
do
know
it
would
be
like
the
fable
of
the
two
boys
and
the
walnut
and
what
do
count
asked
gwethyn
mischievously
a
penny
on
the
wrong
side
decidedly
the
best
and
richest
meadows
for
mushrooms
lay
a
little
distance
from
the
highroad
in
a
hollow
not
far
from
the
bank
of
the
river
and
beyond
a
coppice
which
was
enclosed
with
and
strictly
preserved
a
pathway
led
through
the
edge
of
this
wood
and
the
girls
anxious
to
avail
themselves
of
a
short
cut
turned
their
steps
in
that
direction
githa
who
was
walking
first
stopped
for
a
moment
to
admire
a
lovely
clump
of
silver
birches
which
with
gleaming
white
stems
and
shimmering
leaves
stood
as
outposts
of
the
wood
a
blackbird
always
the
sentinel
of
the
wild
flew
from
the
hedge
clattering
a
noisy
warning
of
her
approach
and
roused
a
cock
pheasant
that
whirred
almost
over
her
head
in
his
flight
for
the
open
laughing
at
the
start
it
gave
her
she
climbed
lightly
up
the
steps
of
the
stile
but
at
the
top
she
paused
and
suddenly
drew
back
all
her
merriment
gone
in
a
flash
from
the
farther
side
of
the
fence
down
among
the
bracken
and
the
brambles
she
had
heard
a
groan
an
unmistakably
human
groan
with
a
faint
cry
after
it
that
sounded
something
like
help
gwethyn
she
said
with
a
decided
tremble
in
her
voice
i
believe
there
somebody
lying
down
there
is
there
let
me
look
oh
i
say
it
a
man
and
i
afraid
hurt
illustration
believe
i
broken
my
leg
he
moaned
gwethyn
did
not
delay
a
moment
to
hop
after
githa
over
the
stile
a
figure
in
corduroy
trousers
and
an
old
tweed
jacket
lay
prostrate
in
the
hedge
bottom
at
first
sight
the
girls
feared
he
was
drunk
but
one
glance
at
his
white
face
showed
that
he
needed
their
help
he
raised
himself
rather
shakily
upon
his
elbow
as
they
made
their
appearance
his
cheeks
were
drawn
with
pain
and
his
eyes
were
like
those
of
a
snared
animal
but
they
had
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
bob
gartley
what
the
matter
have
you
hurt
yourself
asked
githa
briefly
oh
thank
goodness
anyone
come
i
believe
i
broken
my
leg
he
moaned
did
you
fall
yes
and
i
ca
move
an
inch
not
even
to
drag
myself
along
i
been
lying
here
all
night
and
i
thought
i
was
goin
to
die
like
a
rabbit
in
a
trap
i
shouted
and
shouted
but
there
were
no
one
to
hear
and
then
i
could
shout
no
more
i
give
the
world
for
a
drop
of
water
he
added
feebly
sinking
back
on
the
bracken
and
his
eyes
i
fetch
some
directly
cried
gwethyn
seizing
the
can
which
they
had
brought
as
a
receptacle
for
the
mushrooms
and
rushing
frantically
in
the
direction
of
the
river
she
was
quite
unused
to
illness
and
had
never
seen
an
accident
before
so
bob
gartley
haggard
face
filled
her
with
alarm
suppose
he
were
to
die
out
there
in
the
wood
before
any
aid
could
be
secured
the
horror
of
the
thought
lent
wings
to
her
feet
without
stopping
to
consider
her
dread
of
bulls
she
climbed
a
high
fence
and
plunging
recklessly
through
a
drove
of
bullocks
reached
the
bank
and
dipped
her
tin
in
the
river
returning
to
the
stile
as
quickly
as
she
had
come
bob
gartley
was
still
alive
that
was
a
mercy
but
he
was
lying
groaning
in
the
most
terrible
manner
githa
looking
very
scared
was
supporting
his
head
with
her
arm
she
seized
the
can
from
gwethyn
and
held
it
to
his
blue
lips
a
long
draught
of
the
water
seemed
to
revive
him
and
he
opened
his
eyes
again
how
be
i
to
get
home
he
asked
plaintively
the
question
roused
githa
to
energy
we
must
do
something
to
your
leg
first
she
replied
gwethyn
remember
our
red
cross
work
it
a
case
for
first
aid
help
me
to
find
some
sticks
and
we
make
splints
i
shall
want
your
handkerchief
and
that
scarf
off
your
hat
i
so
glad
i
put
on
a
soft
belt
this
morning
that
will
help
it
was
easy
enough
to
find
sticks
in
the
coppice
for
amateur
splints
and
githa
set
to
work
with
the
best
skill
she
could
binding
the
pieces
of
wood
firmly
on
each
side
of
the
broken
leg
with
handkerchiefs
gwethyn
scarf
and
her
own
belt
the
patient
moaned
considerably
during
the
operation
but
he
seemed
on
the
whole
grateful
i
might
died
if
you
had
chanced
to
come
by
he
remarked
had
a
night
of
it
how
did
you
manage
to
fall
asked
gwethyn
i
do
know
i
suppose
i
caught
my
foot
in
the
dark
gettin
over
yon
stile
githa
forbore
to
ask
for
what
purpose
he
had
been
visiting
a
game
preserve
at
nightfall
and
turned
her
attention
to
the
more
imminent
and
practical
consideration
of
how
to
convey
him
home
i
must
fetch
help
at
once
she
said
i
believe
we
quite
close
to
cooper
poultry
farm
i
run
there
and
try
and
get
somebody
to
come
do
i
stay
here
then
with
gartley
for
i
do
think
he
ought
to
be
left
alone
in
case
he
turns
faint
again
agreed
gwethyn
this
poultry
farm
was
within
sight
at
the
top
of
a
small
hill
it
was
certainly
the
nearest
place
at
hand
githa
made
a
for
it
through
hedges
and
over
hurdles
if
she
tramped
across
the
corner
of
a
cornfield
her
errand
was
her
excuse
arrived
at
the
house
she
seized
the
knocker
and
gave
in
her
nervousness
a
tremendously
rousing
the
door
was
opened
by
cooper
himself
oh
please
there
been
an
accident
gasped
githa
in
tones
of
tragic
staccato
bob
gartley
has
broken
his
leg
he
down
in
the
wood
there
and
we
do
know
what
to
do
can
you
come
whew
that
a
bad
job
of
course
i
come
perhaps
i
better
bring
a
little
brandy
with
me
yes
and
something
to
carry
him
on
for
it
will
be
the
dickens
to
move
him
my
man
will
help
he
round
now
with
the
hens
between
us
i
should
think
we
ought
to
be
able
to
manage
it
and
if
not
we
can
fetch
somebody
from
pratt
farm
perhaps
i
can
carry
something
said
githa
could
i
hurry
back
first
with
the
brandy
no
no
if
you
do
mind
waiting
a
second
i
come
with
you
i
know
where
the
fellow
is
he
lying
just
by
the
stile
that
leads
into
the
wood
you
miss
the
place
hello
jack
are
you
there
i
want
you
bring
two
long
and
follow
me
down
to
the
birch
coppice
no
never
mind
the
hens
at
present
they
have
to
wait
leaving
githa
for
a
moment
on
the
cooper
darted
into
his
emerging
in
an
incredibly
short
space
of
time
with
a
flask
in
his
hand
and
a
blanket
flung
over
his
arm
it
bob
gartley
you
say
he
commented
oh
yes
i
know
the
fellow
well
enough
a
disreputable
scamp
he
is
too
he
was
in
the
coppice
for
no
good
you
may
be
sure
still
of
course
we
ca
leave
him
there
though
it
will
be
a
doubtful
benefit
to
his
wife
and
family
to
cart
him
back
with
a
broken
leg
if
you
consulted
the
gamekeeper
i
expect
prefer
nailing
him
to
a
corner
of
the
lodge
in
company
with
a
choice
collection
of
stoats
hawks
and
owls
he
certainly
classes
poachers
under
the
head
of
vermin
they
found
gwethyn
looking
out
anxiously
for
them
and
much
relieved
at
their
arrival
her
patient
had
fainted
after
githa
left
and
she
had
been
obliged
to
fetch
more
water
from
the
river
to
revive
him
he
was
conscious
now
but
very
weak
and
scarcely
able
to
speak
we
soon
have
him
home
said
cooper
pouring
a
few
spoonfuls
of
the
brandy
between
his
lips
this
will
bring
him
round
a
little
see
oh
there
you
are
jack
got
the
that
all
right
now
we
must
manage
to
make
a
litter
cooper
undoubtedly
had
a
head
upon
his
shoulders
and
knew
exactly
how
to
manage
in
the
circumstances
he
spread
the
blanket
on
the
ground
and
with
jack
assistance
lifted
bob
gartley
on
to
it
then
rolling
each
side
tightly
along
a
broom
handle
he
contrived
a
kind
of
hammock
on
which
it
was
possible
to
carry
the
unfortunate
man
the
first
and
greatest
difficulty
was
to
get
him
out
of
the
wood
it
was
hopeless
to
think
of
lifting
him
over
the
stile
so
they
were
obliged
to
beat
down
the
hedge
and
make
a
gap
sufficiently
wide
to
admit
their
ambulance
we
must
explain
it
to
the
keeper
afterwards
said
cooper
it
will
be
comparatively
easy
now
across
the
fields
step
with
me
jack
and
perhaps
we
sha
shake
him
so
much
the
poor
chap
in
awful
pain
now
then
left
right
left
right
we
get
him
to
the
road
and
then
call
at
pratt
farm
and
ask
them
to
lend
their
cart
it
would
be
difficult
to
carry
him
all
the
way
to
heathwell
the
sooner
he
home
and
the
doctor
can
set
his
leg
the
better
though
i
must
say
this
first
aid
has
been
splendid
if
one
of
you
young
ladies
do
mind
taking
the
flask
out
of
my
pocket
you
might
moisten
his
lips
with
the
brandy
he
looks
as
if
he
were
going
to
faint
again
the
people
at
pratt
farm
were
busy
haymaking
but
they
put
down
their
rakes
in
stolid
astonishment
at
the
news
of
the
accident
and
after
turning
the
matter
over
for
a
short
time
in
their
rustic
brains
agreed
to
lend
their
horse
and
cart
to
convey
the
invalid
home
we
put
a
good
layer
of
straw
for
him
to
lie
on
said
pratt
it
save
him
from
the
jolting
a
bit
yes
he
be
too
big
and
heavy
to
carry
all
the
way
to
heathwell
on
that
blanket
my
goodness
he
do
look
bad
i
should
be
surprised
to
see
him
took
lor
it
need
be
a
warning
to
him
if
he
pulls
round
so
it
will
for
sure
it
sent
as
a
judgment
without
doubt
agreed
pratt
gazing
with
contemplative
interest
at
the
moaning
victim
laid
temporarily
by
the
roadside
i
wish
they
think
less
about
warnings
and
judgments
and
be
a
little
quicker
with
the
cart
whispered
githa
i
offer
to
help
them
get
it
ready
that
will
probably
hurry
them
replied
cooper
country
people
have
no
idea
of
the
value
of
time
in
these
cases
or
indeed
in
any
matter
at
all
as
i
often
find
to
my
cost
after
what
seemed
an
incredible
waste
of
precious
minutes
the
cart
was
at
last
brought
out
and
bob
lifted
on
to
the
pile
of
straw
sending
his
man
back
to
feed
the
hens
cooper
decided
to
ride
himself
with
the
invalid
while
githa
and
gwethyn
ran
on
to
warn
gartley
of
what
had
occurred
they
found
the
poor
woman
in
a
state
of
indescribable
muddle
doing
some
belated
washing
gwethyn
with
a
promise
of
sweets
managed
to
cajole
all
the
little
ones
from
the
cottage
while
githa
broke
the
news
as
gently
as
she
could
to
the
mother
i
knew
it
come
to
this
some
day
exclaimed
gartley
flinging
her
apron
over
her
head
and
collapsing
in
tears
on
to
a
chair
told
him
fifty
times
if
i
told
him
once
there
no
good
happen
from
the
way
he
was
carrying
on
but
he
never
would
listen
to
i
have
you
got
everything
ready
for
him
asked
githa
he
ought
to
lie
on
a
mattress
not
a
soft
bed
cooper
says
i
can
hear
the
cart
coming
now
as
soon
as
they
brought
him
in
we
must
send
a
messenger
for
the
doctor
it
was
such
a
limp
moaning
burden
which
was
carried
upstairs
that
gartley
broke
into
frantic
hysterical
sobs
at
the
sight
and
was
no
more
use
than
the
children
who
scenting
the
fact
that
for
some
reason
they
were
being
kept
out
of
the
way
evaded
gwethyn
blandishments
and
tore
back
into
the
cottage
the
men
however
made
the
poor
fellow
as
comfortable
as
they
could
and
so
many
neighbours
began
to
arrive
that
there
was
soon
far
more
help
than
was
necessary
we
may
as
well
go
said
cooper
to
the
two
girls
we
done
all
we
can
and
he
have
to
wait
now
for
the
doctor
bob
was
lying
quite
still
with
his
eyes
shut
and
his
face
as
white
as
his
pillow
but
he
evidently
heard
that
for
he
roused
himself
if
it
had
for
you
i
ha
died
in
the
wood
he
said
i
sha
forget
githa
and
gwethyn
had
gathered
not
a
single
mushroom
but
they
were
much
too
excited
even
to
think
about
them
they
ran
up
to
aireyholme
to
tell
their
news
before
they
walked
back
to
the
gables
and
miss
aubrey
promised
to
go
at
once
to
the
gartleys
cottage
to
render
what
aid
she
could
ledbury
also
was
much
concerned
when
she
heard
the
report
of
their
morning
adventure
and
sent
during
the
afternoon
to
inquire
about
the
invalid
he
a
bad
lot
that
bob
gartley
said
ledbury
i
have
more
than
a
suspicion
that
he
comes
poaching
into
my
woods
i
seen
him
skulking
about
once
or
twice
still
in
the
name
of
humanity
you
bound
to
help
a
man
even
if
you
find
him
with
a
hare
in
one
pocket
and
a
cock
pheasant
in
the
other
you
ca
let
him
lie
with
a
broken
leg
sorry
for
his
wife
poor
thing
chapter
xx
bob
gartley
explains
the
prospects
of
the
gartley
family
at
present
were
certainly
not
of
a
rosy
description
with
her
husband
in
bed
gartley
could
not
go
out
to
work
and
her
household
was
obliged
to
subsist
as
best
it
could
on
charity
the
parish
allowed
some
outdoor
relief
which
was
supplemented
by
doles
from
the
church
funds
and
neighbours
now
that
there
was
the
excuse
of
real
sickness
were
kind
in
giving
practical
help
there
was
no
danger
of
actual
starvation
though
luxuries
were
out
of
the
question
laid
by
the
heels
with
no
exciting
expeditions
to
break
the
monotony
of
his
days
bob
gartley
alternately
pitied
himself
and
railed
at
fate
he
was
a
fractious
invalid
and
spared
his
wife
neither
time
nor
trouble
in
attending
to
his
wants
he
be
worse
nor
a
baby
she
complained
to
her
friends
i
only
to
get
him
settled
and
go
downstairs
and
begin
a
bit
o
washin
when
there
he
is
hollerin
for
me
again
and
all
about
naught
i
fair
lose
my
patience
sometimes
but
he
keeps
a
boot
handy
under
his
pillow
ready
to
fling
at
i
if
i
crosses
him
and
he
be
such
a
good
shot
he
never
misses
duck
as
i
will
the
exactions
of
her
lord
and
master
kept
gartley
so
busy
that
her
family
lived
more
than
ever
in
the
road
escaping
passing
motors
by
a
miracle
and
receiving
chance
meals
from
anybody
who
had
fragments
to
spare
a
practice
rather
sniffed
at
by
some
of
the
neighbours
not
as
i
any
wish
to
see
go
wantin
remarked
blundell
but
i
think
they
doin
better
now
than
when
their
father
had
his
health
hungry
why
yes
they
always
be
ready
to
eat
sweet
stuff
at
any
hour
of
day
that
do
prove
they
be
in
need
as
for
bob
gartley
he
must
be
livin
like
a
fightin
cock
with
all
they
basins
of
broth
and
pots
of
jelly
he
want
to
break
his
leg
again
when
times
is
bad
lying
in
his
stuffy
little
bedroom
gartley
had
leisure
to
consider
his
circumstances
and
air
his
views
he
carefully
compared
the
various
viands
that
were
sent
him
with
criticisms
on
the
culinary
skill
of
the
donors
do
bring
me
no
more
broth
he
said
to
his
wife
one
afternoon
sick
of
the
very
sight
of
it
might
as
well
be
in
hospital
why
you
get
me
a
scrap
of
liver
and
bacon
doctor
said
we
was
to
give
you
that
on
no
account
objected
gartley
i
wish
they
had
taken
you
to
hospital
while
they
was
about
it
if
it
had
been
i
i
have
jumped
at
goin
shows
how
much
you
knows
about
it
why
when
i
was
in
the
infirmary
they
washed
me
all
over
every
day
yes
it
the
truth
i
tellin
you
and
they
left
windows
open
all
day
long
and
would
allow
me
a
smoke
or
even
a
chew
of
no
more
hospitals
says
i
take
that
broth
away
ca
you
ai
there
any
jelly
in
the
house
no
the
pot
empty
then
you
let
those
brats
get
at
it
i
ai
you
had
it
all
yourself
maybe
they
be
sending
some
more
from
somewheres
like
enough
but
you
wo
get
much
more
from
aireyholme
why
not
asked
gartley
much
aggrieved
because
the
young
ladies
is
going
away
next
week
oh
it
their
holidays
is
it
aye
the
school
always
shut
up
in
holiday
time
miss
aubrey
and
franklin
goes
away
too
the
news
appeared
to
make
bob
thoughtful
and
he
pondered
over
it
for
a
few
moments
i
suppose
that
young
lady
be
takin
that
little
cupboard
with
her
he
remarked
at
last
what
little
cupboard
why
you
stupid
the
one
as
she
put
in
the
picture
with
granny
blundell
and
our
hugh
she
bought
it
from
mrs
stubbs
oh
i
remember
yes
if
she
bought
it
and
paid
for
it
of
course
she
be
takin
it
with
her
it
hard
for
a
poor
man
to
be
tied
to
his
bed
as
helpless
as
a
log
groaned
bob
goodness
knows
what
she
do
with
it
if
she
takes
it
away
sell
it
again
maybe
anyways
i
shall
be
off
the
track
of
it
what
do
you
mean
queried
his
wife
i
ca
see
as
you
got
aught
to
do
with
miss
marsden
cupboard
you
never
could
see
farther
than
your
nose
jane
some
of
they
young
ladies
has
been
very
good
to
a
poor
man
i
if
they
had
found
me
in
the
wood
why
yes
i
know
that
exclaimed
gartley
immensely
amazed
at
such
an
unwonted
outburst
of
gratitude
it
might
be
good
for
a
fiver
murmured
bob
that
little
enough
but
it
would
be
better
than
missin
everything
look
here
jane
send
mary
across
to
aireyholme
and
tell
her
to
say
i
like
to
see
miss
hamilton
on
a
bit
of
special
business
what
it
all
about
asked
gartley
inquisitively
never
you
mind
leave
that
to
me
and
send
the
child
as
i
tell
you
little
mary
gartley
arrived
with
her
message
soon
after
four
just
as
githa
was
leaving
school
gwethyn
was
walking
with
her
down
the
drive
being
in
fact
on
her
way
to
the
gartleys
cottage
to
leave
a
basketful
of
fruit
from
franklin
both
girls
were
much
astonished
at
the
summons
are
you
sure
your
father
wants
me
asked
githa
yes
miss
he
said
most
particular
as
it
was
miss
hamilton
come
with
me
gwethyn
begged
githa
you
have
to
call
at
the
door
in
any
case
i
sure
franklin
would
mind
your
going
in
perhaps
gartley
wants
to
thank
us
for
our
aid
i
do
like
going
alone
all
serene
returned
gwethyn
whose
curiosity
was
considerably
aroused
he
do
be
askin
for
you
said
gartley
who
greeted
the
girls
at
the
door
what
come
over
him
passes
me
but
he
set
on
seein
you
it
a
poor
place
upstairs
and
i
not
had
time
lately
for
cleanin
still
if
you
would
mind
steppin
up
oh
it
all
right
said
githa
stopping
the
apologies
will
you
go
first
to
show
us
the
way
well
gartley
as
they
entered
the
room
you
look
a
little
better
than
when
we
saw
you
last
i
might
easy
do
that
replied
bob
then
turning
to
his
wife
he
whispered
chuck
they
brats
downstairs
we
do
want
here
gartley
hastened
to
put
to
flight
five
of
her
offspring
who
had
followed
the
interesting
visitors
and
having
administered
chastisement
and
locked
them
out
of
the
house
returned
panting
from
the
fray
fearful
of
missing
the
least
detail
of
the
conference
when
his
audience
was
ranged
conveniently
round
his
bedside
bob
gartley
greatly
enjoying
the
sense
of
his
own
importance
opened
the
conversation
i
sent
for
you
miss
hamilton
he
began
because
there
a
something
i
had
on
my
mind
you
done
me
a
good
turn
and
i
be
ready
to
do
a
turn
back
suppose
now
as
i
had
a
bit
of
information
that
might
mean
a
deal
to
you
i
reckon
as
you
be
glad
to
get
hold
of
it
i
no
doubt
i
should
replied
githa
if
it
anything
worth
knowing
it
be
well
worth
knowing
do
you
have
no
fear
on
that
score
it
might
be
the
makin
of
you
and
it
would
clear
up
a
mystery
too
what
do
you
mean
asked
githa
quickly
i
a
poor
man
returned
gartley
evasively
i
a
big
family
to
keep
and
i
wears
myself
out
with
strivin
for
it
be
worth
anybody
while
to
know
what
i
knows
but
the
question
is
whether
it
be
worth
my
while
to
let
on
maybe
i
best
keep
my
information
to
myself
suppose
it
were
made
worth
your
while
to
tell
it
returned
githa
grasping
the
situation
ah
that
be
a
horse
of
another
colour
i
be
grateful
for
what
you
for
me
do
you
be
mistakin
me
on
that
point
but
i
ca
afford
to
be
givin
away
gratis
what
ought
to
be
good
for
golden
sovereigns
how
many
do
you
want
inquired
githa
i
no
wish
to
seem
graspin
replied
bob
virtuously
no
one
can
accuse
me
of
tryin
to
get
more
than
my
dues
but
i
not
denyin
as
five
pounds
would
be
a
very
handy
little
sum
just
at
present
as
circumstances
is
rather
awkward
i
have
five
pounds
in
the
savings
bank
you
shall
have
it
if
you
really
have
any
information
to
give
me
you
shall
be
judge
of
that
and
i
reckon
you
be
surprised
when
you
hear
what
i
got
to
tell
jane
is
there
anyone
on
the
stairs
not
a
soul
and
the
door
locked
said
gartley
who
stood
by
consumed
with
curiosity
and
almost
more
eager
than
the
girls
for
the
coming
revelations
that
be
all
right
then
i
do
hold
with
eavesdroppin
i
were
always
taught
as
it
were
mean
and
underhand
it
was
five
quid
as
we
mentioned
was
it
thanks
there
ai
nothing
like
bein
sure
of
one
ground
well
as
you
really
anxious
to
know
what
i
knows
tell
you
it
were
three
years
ago
come
last
march
and
i
happened
to
be
out
one
night
after
a
little
bit
of
business
of
my
own
which
took
me
round
by
the
grange
it
were
quite
late
maybe
between
twelve
and
one
and
i
were
in
a
hurry
to
get
back
to
my
family
so
i
makes
a
short
cut
through
the
garden
all
the
house
were
shut
up
and
dark
and
it
were
plain
as
everyone
was
in
bed
so
i
says
to
myself
when
i
comes
round
the
corner
though
if
i
do
see
a
light
in
one
of
the
lower
windows
as
i
goes
past
i
noticed
that
though
the
blind
were
down
it
were
drawn
full
to
the
bottom
and
there
was
a
chink
of
about
half
an
inch
left
i
a
man
as
takes
a
kind
of
interest
in
my
neighbours
so
i
puts
my
eye
to
it
and
i
gets
a
very
good
view
into
the
room
there
was
old
ledbury
standin
by
the
fireplace
and
he
were
turnin
over
some
papers
in
his
hand
i
take
my
bible
oath
they
was
he
counted
and
put
inside
an
envelope
then
what
does
he
do
but
go
across
the
room
me
watching
him
all
the
time
at
my
and
he
twists
a
knob
round
and
opens
one
of
the
panels
in
the
wall
he
looks
at
it
as
if
he
was
goin
to
put
the
papers
in
there
then
he
seems
to
change
his
mind
he
shakes
his
head
and
shuts
it
up
again
and
goes
over
to
side
of
the
room
where
there
was
a
little
oak
cupboard
i
could
see
him
as
plain
as
i
sees
you
now
there
was
small
drawers
in
that
cupboard
and
an
empty
space
in
the
middle
of
he
slides
a
piece
of
wood
aside
there
and
takes
a
key
from
his
pocket
and
unlocks
a
little
door
at
the
back
among
the
drawers
and
he
puts
the
envelope
in
there
and
locks
it
up
again
then
he
goes
back
to
his
by
the
fireside
gartley
i
says
to
myself
you
found
out
something
and
maybe
you
have
but
you
best
keep
a
still
tongue
in
your
head
so
i
never
tells
no
one
not
even
my
missis
here
that
you
did
agreed
gartley
i
be
the
last
you
tell
i
ca
make
out
what
you
drivin
at
you
wait
and
see
and
you
find
out
fast
enough
that
night
as
i
looked
through
the
window
was
the
very
one
afore
old
ledbury
was
took
bad
and
died
when
it
came
to
readin
his
will
there
was
a
lot
of
talk
in
the
village
and
folks
said
as
a
big
sum
of
money
were
missing
and
could
be
traced
nohow
and
he
must
have
gambled
it
away
i
my
own
ideas
on
the
subject
but
did
you
tell
anybody
gasped
githa
not
i
it
were
none
of
my
business
i
enough
trouble
on
my
own
account
just
then
for
me
to
want
to
be
mixed
up
in
anyone
affairs
i
remember
exclaimed
gartley
you
was
doin
time
you
got
three
months
hard
for
puttin
a
bullet
through
the
keeper
hat
it
do
matter
what
i
were
doin
said
bob
sulkily
at
any
rate
an
engagement
wot
kept
me
from
puttin
myself
in
a
public
position
when
i
gets
back
to
heathwell
do
you
think
i
were
anxious
to
go
and
interview
wilfred
ledbury
just
then
and
tell
him
my
views
no
had
enough
of
lawyers
for
the
present
they
was
inclined
to
doubt
my
word
somehow
and
it
hurts
an
honest
man
feelin
to
be
told
as
a
liar
i
thought
i
keep
my
eye
though
on
that
little
cupboard
but
i
found
there
been
an
auction
and
it
were
sold
i
could
get
on
the
track
of
it
do
what
i
would
or
hear
who
it
and
i
gives
it
up
as
a
bad
job
then
one
day
that
young
lady
comes
into
the
house
our
hugh
there
were
an
oak
cupboard
in
her
picture
and
i
knows
it
again
in
a
minute
you
do
mean
to
say
cried
gwethyn
springing
to
her
feet
aye
but
i
do
that
be
the
very
one
as
i
sees
old
ledbury
put
the
envelope
inside
gwethyn
and
githa
left
the
cottage
in
a
state
of
the
wildest
excitement
they
went
straight
back
to
school
and
ran
upstairs
to
the
studio
fortunately
no
one
was
in
the
room
so
they
were
able
at
once
to
begin
investigations
on
the
little
oak
cupboard
they
pulled
out
all
the
small
drawers
and
poked
and
pushed
in
every
possible
direction
but
not
a
sign
of
a
secret
could
they
find
the
wood
at
the
back
of
the
recess
in
the
middle
seemed
perfectly
solid
and
could
not
be
made
to
budge
by
the
fraction
of
an
inch
they
were
very
baffled
and
after
their
success
in
finding
the
moving
panel
at
the
grange
it
was
the
more
particularly
disappointing
i
suppose
bob
gartley
really
did
see
what
he
says
he
saw
ventured
githa
rather
doubtfully
i
wonder
he
never
mentioned
it
before
reading
between
the
lines
i
should
say
he
had
two
good
reasons
for
his
silence
replied
gwethyn
he
was
probably
at
the
grange
that
night
on
a
dishonest
errand
and
did
want
the
matter
investigated
and
also
perhaps
he
thought
he
might
find
a
chance
some
time
to
appropriate
the
notes
he
spoke
very
regretfully
about
them
do
you
think
it
could
have
been
he
who
tried
to
break
into
aireyholme
i
have
the
least
doubt
of
it
that
scare
happened
soon
after
katrine
had
painted
her
picture
of
the
cupboard
it
never
struck
anybody
to
connect
the
two
he
must
have
intended
to
get
in
through
the
window
go
upstairs
to
the
studio
and
hunt
about
for
himself
he
might
have
managed
it
if
we
had
had
tony
that
night
the
darling
roused
us
with
his
growling
what
was
to
be
done
next
that
was
the
important
question
if
bob
gartley
account
were
true
and
a
secret
place
really
existed
probably
the
only
way
to
find
it
would
be
to
have
a
joiner
up
and
get
him
to
take
the
spice
cupboard
entirely
to
pieces
but
it
was
property
and
this
could
not
be
done
without
her
permission
she
was
out
sketching
this
afternoon
with
miss
aubrey
gwethyn
promised
to
broach
the
matter
to
her
when
she
returned
do
tell
anybody
else
please
said
githa
i
rather
this
talked
about
in
the
school
if
there
really
are
inside
this
cupboard
they
wo
be
mine
i
suppose
they
be
uncle
wilfred
the
same
as
all
the
rest
of
everything
unless
there
were
a
will
no
such
luck
ceddie
and
i
were
born
under
fortunate
stars
i
must
be
going
home
now
it
most
fearfully
late
do
forget
it
the
sports
rather
not
chapter
xxi
the
sports
the
summer
term
at
aireyholme
always
wound
up
with
the
sports
they
were
as
much
of
an
institution
as
the
dramatic
performance
given
shortly
before
christmas
the
girls
stuck
to
them
with
conservative
zeal
several
times
franklin
had
suggested
some
other
kind
of
fête
to
celebrate
the
close
of
the
school
year
but
concerts
tennis
tournaments
or
pastoral
plays
were
alike
rejected
in
favour
of
athletics
for
the
last
week
the
committee
had
been
at
work
arranging
the
events
and
making
copies
of
the
programme
the
prizes
were
on
view
in
the
studio
and
were
inspected
with
deep
interest
on
the
morning
of
the
great
day
i
ca
think
why
you
should
make
such
a
fuss
about
sports
said
katrine
who
was
touching
up
some
sketches
and
found
her
painting
operations
decidedly
hindered
by
the
crowd
clustering
round
the
table
if
you
had
an
art
competition
now
it
would
have
been
far
nicer
why
did
you
because
we
got
to
think
of
something
to
suit
the
whole
school
and
not
just
a
few
hobbyists
returned
viola
rather
touchily
absolutely
obsessed
with
painting
we
monitresses
take
an
view
and
consider
the
general
good
is
it
for
the
general
good
to
elevate
public
taste
asked
katrine
who
never
missed
an
opportunity
of
arguing
with
viola
certainly
but
it
not
fair
on
an
occasion
like
this
to
have
a
competition
for
which
only
an
elect
number
are
eligible
sports
are
democratic
things
every
one
has
the
same
chance
now
there
i
do
agree
with
you
some
girls
are
better
at
running
and
jumping
just
as
others
are
cleverer
at
music
or
painting
sports
a
scrap
more
democratic
really
they
only
offer
a
different
field
of
battle
your
artistic
genius
may
be
a
duffer
at
a
sack
race
and
your
crack
pianist
a
with
a
ball
you
must
admit
that
i
sha
admit
anything
of
the
sort
it
well
known
in
every
school
that
athletics
are
the
fairest
things
going
that
why
they
so
popular
but
from
your
own
reasoning
oh
i
say
stop
for
the
sake
of
peace
interrupted
diana
going
to
have
the
sports
so
what
the
good
of
barging
about
them
if
you
write
a
few
extra
programmes
katrine
marsden
instead
of
giving
your
opinions
there
be
some
sense
in
it
i
thought
you
had
enough
we
could
do
with
half
a
dozen
more
it
horrid
to
be
short
and
extra
visitors
sometimes
turn
up
it
was
the
tradition
of
the
school
that
the
summer
fête
should
be
held
on
the
last
saturday
in
july
though
not
the
actual
day
in
the
estimation
of
the
girls
it
was
almost
as
good
after
classes
there
were
no
more
lessons
monday
would
be
devoted
to
packing
and
on
tuesday
all
would
be
speeding
away
by
train
to
different
points
of
the
compass
it
was
a
kind
of
day
rules
were
relaxed
and
everybody
made
the
most
of
the
holiday
a
band
of
helpers
under
the
superintendence
of
the
games
committee
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
morning
preparing
the
forms
were
carried
out
to
accommodate
the
spectators
hurdles
and
other
obstacles
were
arranged
and
the
ground
for
the
long
jump
freshly
raked
it
frightfully
rough
on
coralie
that
she
may
compete
this
year
said
hilda
smart
she
something
wrong
with
her
heart
i
believe
anyhow
the
doctor
has
absolutely
forbidden
it
poor
old
corrie
so
disappointed
she
was
ever
so
keen
on
winning
a
medal
she
just
have
to
sit
and
watch
like
a
visitor
and
tita
has
blistered
her
foot
and
ca
run
so
two
of
us
are
off
commented
diana
it
hard
luck
on
the
sixth
never
mind
we
got
gladwin
and
ellaline
they
have
to
brace
up
for
the
credit
of
the
form
trust
them
but
some
of
the
fifth
are
and
may
steal
a
march
on
us
not
while
dorrie
vernon
alive
i
back
her
against
anybody
has
katrine
marsden
put
her
name
down
for
anything
only
for
the
bicycle
race
she
thinks
the
other
competitions
hoydenish
if
you
called
them
olympic
contests
and
required
candidates
to
come
attired
in
ancient
greek
costumes
she
have
been
madly
enthusiastic
grinned
diana
much
jumping
one
would
do
in
classic
draperies
sniffed
hilda
scornfully
what
does
that
kid
want
hallooing
at
us
over
there
novie
bates
was
running
down
the
field
yelling
at
the
pitch
of
her
voice
for
diana
you
to
come
at
once
she
shouted
franklin
wants
you
i
saw
the
telegraph
boy
coming
up
the
drive
diana
promptly
dropped
her
rake
and
fled
towards
the
house
followed
by
hilda
and
the
rest
on
this
most
propitious
day
the
results
of
the
matriculation
examination
might
be
expected
to
be
published
and
the
three
candidates
were
on
the
for
news
franklin
was
standing
by
the
front
door
with
the
yellow
envelope
in
her
hand
but
she
did
not
divulge
its
contents
until
dorrie
and
viola
also
came
hurrying
up
all
passed
viola
first
division
diana
and
dorrie
in
the
second
the
welcome
information
was
handed
on
from
girl
to
girl
till
in
a
few
minutes
everybody
in
the
school
knew
of
it
and
ran
to
offer
congratulations
to
the
heroines
of
the
hour
the
principal
who
had
always
considered
diana
mathematics
shaky
was
looking
immensely
relieved
it
was
a
triumph
that
all
were
through
and
a
very
happy
finish
for
the
term
last
year
two
out
of
the
five
candidates
had
failed
a
deep
humiliation
to
franklin
but
this
success
restored
the
credit
of
aireyholme
it
put
everybody
in
a
good
temper
and
made
quite
a
gala
atmosphere
in
the
establishment
the
monitresses
took
their
laurels
with
an
air
of
dignified
humility
they
were
gratified
but
left
the
rejoicing
to
their
friends
of
course
when
you
worked
for
a
thing
it
a
comfort
to
pass
admitted
viola
with
nonchalance
if
i
got
a
first
div
i
be
too
proud
to
know
what
to
do
with
myself
declared
laura
browne
ecstatically
will
your
names
be
put
in
the
newspapers
asked
yvonne
with
awed
admiration
we
ought
to
run
up
a
special
flag
suggested
jill
barton
there
that
enough
on
our
behalf
said
viola
some
of
the
rest
of
you
must
do
credit
to
the
school
this
afternoon
i
hope
you
all
in
good
form
do
go
tearing
about
the
place
and
getting
yourselves
too
hot
beforehand
it
a
waste
of
superfluous
energy
the
sports
were
to
begin
at
two
and
by
that
hour
the
competitors
and
the
greater
number
of
the
spectators
were
in
their
places
invitations
had
been
sent
to
residents
in
the
neighbourhood
and
though
the
visitors
were
not
so
many
as
on
waterloo
day
there
were
quite
enough
to
fill
the
seats
which
had
been
carried
out
for
their
accommodation
githa
arrived
rather
late
it
had
been
intended
that
she
should
motor
over
with
her
uncle
and
aunt
but
at
the
last
moment
and
ledbury
were
delayed
by
a
telegram
the
contents
of
which
they
did
not
disclose
to
her
and
she
had
set
off
on
her
bicycle
by
quick
scorching
she
managed
to
join
the
ranks
of
the
school
just
in
the
nick
of
time
she
waved
to
gwethyn
but
there
was
no
opportunity
of
speaking
for
the
girls
were
ranged
according
to
their
forms
miss
andrews
and
miss
spencer
were
respectively
to
be
starter
and
and
boswell
and
the
vicar
would
act
as
judges
the
prizes
arranged
on
a
small
table
would
be
distributed
by
boswell
the
patriotic
league
had
been
anxious
to
forgo
prizes
altogether
and
offer
bouquets
of
flowers
or
crowns
of
laurel
to
the
victors
but
this
decision
was
overruled
by
franklin
who
thought
the
school
honour
demanded
at
least
a
few
inexpensive
medals
to
grace
the
occasion
i
shall
not
get
silver
ones
this
year
she
had
decreed
but
as
we
have
the
die
the
cost
of
metal
ones
will
be
comparatively
trifling
boswell
is
very
kindly
giving
the
form
trophy
and
gordon
the
prize
for
the
bicycle
race
miss
aubrey
the
mistresses
and
myself
wish
to
pay
for
the
medals
amongst
us
and
the
shillings
which
you
girls
usually
subscribe
can
be
sent
either
to
the
national
relief
fund
or
to
the
belgian
fund
whichever
you
choose
this
arrangement
satisfied
even
the
most
patriotic
conscience
all
had
felt
that
the
sports
would
not
be
complete
without
medals
though
they
were
heroically
prepared
to
make
the
sacrifice
the
athletic
prize
badges
were
coveted
distinctions
at
aireyholme
and
were
treasured
by
their
winners
almost
above
the
books
generally
awarded
for
successes
in
form
examinations
this
summer
the
medals
would
be
specially
attractive
for
they
would
seem
almost
like
military
decorations
each
girl
was
wearing
her
form
rosette
the
sixth
pink
the
fifth
green
and
the
fourth
blue
the
monitresses
in
addition
had
white
favours
and
the
members
of
the
games
committee
whose
duty
it
was
to
keep
order
and
marshal
the
competitors
wore
a
c
embroidered
on
a
mauve
ribbon
the
first
event
was
the
junior
plain
race
the
fifteen
members
of
form
iv
started
with
great
enthusiasm
and
tore
over
the
ground
as
rapidly
as
their
respective
running
powers
permitted
big
hebe
bennett
bertha
grant
also
fat
and
scant
of
breath
and
myrtle
goodwin
were
soon
distanced
by
their
more
agile
companions
yvonne
and
mélanie
made
a
gallant
struggle
but
fell
behind
and
after
an
exciting
heat
between
garnet
adams
and
gwendolen
jackson
ended
by
nora
parnell
making
a
sudden
spurt
and
beating
them
both
in
the
higher
forms
megan
owen
and
ellaline
dickens
proved
the
atalantas
megan
though
short
and
stoutly
built
was
remarkably
and
ellaline
tall
and
willowy
covered
the
ground
at
a
swinging
pace
that
distanced
even
dorrie
vernon
the
crack
champion
of
the
sixth
dorrie
redeemed
her
character
however
in
the
next
event
her
record
in
the
long
jump
was
the
highest
ever
known
at
aireyholme
it
evoked
loud
cheers
and
she
retired
with
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
her
feat
would
be
duly
entered
in
the
athletic
minutes
of
the
school
the
high
jump
came
next
on
the
programme
juniors
led
the
way
and
showed
much
agility
for
several
rounds
ten
of
them
cleared
the
bar
but
the
next
trial
proved
fatal
to
seven
leaving
only
novie
myrtle
and
githa
on
the
field
it
was
a
hard
contest
between
these
three
they
were
very
evenly
matched
novie
was
the
tallest
but
githa
had
the
best
springing
power
and
came
off
victor
in
the
end
glad
the
poor
old
toadstool
scored
commented
dona
matthews
to
gwethyn
it
a
tremendous
feather
in
her
cap
because
she
has
been
able
to
practise
as
much
as
the
rest
of
her
form
those
kids
have
been
at
it
half
the
evening
all
through
this
week
our
turn
next
hope
you
feeling
fit
i
do
my
best
but
i
always
find
the
feminine
petticoat
an
encumbrance
even
a
gymnasium
skirt
is
apt
to
catch
boys
have
that
immense
advantage
at
athletics
well
it
the
same
for
us
all
so
we
must
take
the
petticoat
as
a
handicap
gwethyn
was
fairly
good
at
jumping
and
held
her
own
well
in
the
form
she
kept
up
pluckily
when
beatrix
susie
and
even
dona
had
fallen
out
a
large
mat
had
been
placed
for
the
girls
to
jump
on
to
but
the
grass
was
very
dry
and
just
where
the
spring
must
be
taken
it
had
become
slippery
gwethyn
so
near
to
victory
slid
alas
as
on
ice
and
came
a
heavy
cropper
she
got
up
ruefully
rubbing
her
leg
not
seriously
injured
but
too
temporarily
lame
to
make
another
trial
and
the
triumph
was
scored
by
rose
randall
not
even
the
sixth
who
followed
being
able
to
break
her
record
the
sack
race
for
juniors
was
attended
with
much
merriment
the
fifteen
members
of
the
fourth
fastened
up
securely
to
the
neck
in
clean
sacks
were
laid
on
their
backs
in
a
giggling
row
at
the
word
of
command
from
the
starter
they
struggled
somehow
to
their
feet
and
began
to
make
what
shuffling
progress
they
might
it
was
a
case
of
most
haste
least
speed
for
hurry
only
resulted
in
a
fall
and
often
five
or
six
girls
would
be
squirming
like
caterpillars
on
the
ground
hopping
stumbling
tripping
anything
but
running
the
competitors
made
their
slow
way
till
jess
howard
the
foremost
literally
tumbled
across
the
ribbon
lying
mirthful
and
speechless
till
she
was
raised
and
released
from
her
impediment
by
the
stewards
the
bicycle
race
was
less
of
an
open
competition
for
only
those
could
enter
who
possessed
machines
there
were
ten
candidates
altogether
katrine
gwethyn
and
githa
being
among
the
number
it
was
the
sole
event
in
the
sports
for
which
katrine
would
compete
she
affected
to
consider
running
and
jumping
only
fit
for
juniors
and
stood
aloof
from
such
childish
recreations
as
she
termed
them
greatly
to
the
indignation
and
scorn
of
the
monitresses
who
held
a
brief
for
athletics
the
race
was
by
no
means
plain
riding
two
long
rows
of
flowerpots
had
been
placed
with
due
intervals
between
them
and
in
and
out
among
these
the
competitors
must
guide
their
machines
in
a
tortuous
twist
it
was
a
matter
of
balance
and
careful
steering
and
katrine
who
was
perhaps
a
little
too
airily
confident
came
to
grief
over
the
ninth
pot
rather
i
am
afraid
to
the
satisfaction
of
some
of
the
members
of
the
sixth
who
chuckled
together
at
her
want
of
prowess
katrine
however
had
the
virtue
of
being
able
to
take
defeat
in
a
sporting
manner
she
wheeled
her
bicycle
away
and
watched
the
finish
from
a
quite
disinterested
point
of
view
gwethyn
did
well
but
she
was
still
a
little
stiff
with
her
fall
on
the
grass
and
she
lacked
practice
githa
whose
daily
cycling
to
and
from
school
made
her
absolutely
at
home
on
her
machine
had
a
decided
pull
over
the
others
and
won
by
several
points
it
was
her
second
victory
that
afternoon
and
the
school
applauded
loudly
her
pale
cheeks
flushed
with
pleasure
at
the
sound
of
the
clapping
it
was
sweet
for
once
to
be
appreciated
she
who
was
generally
such
an
outsider
among
the
boarders
good
old
girl
you
outshone
yourself
cried
gwethyn
with
an
admiring
slap
on
the
back
you
wound
about
like
a
boa
constrictor
thanks
for
the
comparison
i
rather
be
a
toadstool
than
a
snake
laughed
githa
the
stewards
were
collecting
and
rearranging
the
flowerpots
and
a
team
of
juniors
came
forward
for
the
tortoise
race
a
difficult
competition
this
for
each
candidate
had
to
conduct
marching
operations
mounted
on
two
flowerpots
and
was
required
to
balance
herself
on
one
leg
on
one
pot
while
she
cautiously
and
skilfully
moved
the
other
pot
forwards
putting
a
foot
to
the
ground
necessitated
returning
to
the
and
several
times
the
foremost
competitors
in
their
anxiety
to
hurry
along
let
zeal
exceed
caution
and
lost
their
balance
true
to
the
title
of
tortoise
the
slow
and
steady
made
the
surest
progress
and
bertha
grant
the
hindmost
in
the
opening
running
scored
at
this
event
on
the
whole
the
girls
voted
the
obstacle
race
the
best
fun
every
competitor
rapidly
worked
a
sum
submitted
it
to
miss
andrews
and
if
correct
tore
away
to
scramble
through
some
hurdles
and
run
over
a
raised
plank
she
was
then
required
to
open
a
parcel
take
out
a
long
skirt
and
put
it
on
continuing
her
course
much
encumbered
by
its
flapping
to
climb
more
hurdles
as
a
finish
lena
dawson
dona
matthews
and
dorrie
vernon
won
credit
for
their
respective
forms
the
latter
particularly
distinguishing
herself
as
she
arrived
at
the
goal
without
having
torn
her
long
skirt
an
achievement
not
accomplished
by
lena
or
dona
the
last
event
the
north
pole
race
was
confined
to
juniors
the
girls
were
first
blindfolded
with
handkerchiefs
then
were
tied
over
their
heads
and
thus
incapacitated
from
seeing
they
were
turned
loose
to
grope
for
the
north
pole
a
stick
placed
in
the
centre
of
the
field
attendant
scouts
kept
them
on
the
course
gently
turning
them
towards
the
goal
when
they
strayed
to
other
points
of
the
compass
but
in
spite
of
this
help
they
would
often
pass
groping
hands
within
a
few
inches
of
the
stick
and
fail
to
grasp
it
after
much
fun
and
excellent
collie
work
on
the
part
of
the
scouts
meta
powers
tumbled
quite
by
accident
over
the
bearing
it
with
her
to
the
ground
as
she
shouted
a
stifled
hurrah
from
within
her
chapter
xxii
the
old
oak
cupboard
there
yet
remained
the
form
trophy
to
be
competed
for
winners
only
in
the
previous
events
being
eligible
as
candidates
to
ensure
equal
chances
for
all
the
test
was
to
be
a
handicap
race
age
and
height
being
taken
into
consideration
the
judges
carefully
placed
the
competitors
tall
rose
randall
getting
little
advantage
over
dorrie
vernon
though
she
was
two
years
younger
and
jess
howard
being
in
a
line
with
dona
matthews
githa
had
been
given
her
and
was
standing
in
readiness
for
the
signal
when
she
noticed
her
uncle
and
aunt
arriving
upon
the
scene
how
late
they
were
they
had
missed
almost
the
entire
programme
who
was
that
stranger
in
khaki
whom
they
had
brought
with
them
they
were
introducing
him
to
franklin
who
was
shaking
hands
and
finding
seats
for
all
three
some
friend
of
uncle
wilfred
she
supposed
but
here
her
reflections
were
brought
to
an
abrupt
close
for
miss
andrews
gave
the
signal
and
the
race
began
owing
to
the
handicaps
it
was
a
closely
matched
affair
all
were
on
their
mettle
and
exerted
themselves
to
the
uttermost
at
first
dona
seemed
to
be
making
the
best
progress
but
dorrie
and
ellaline
were
coming
up
fast
from
behind
and
passed
her
githa
ran
steadily
until
the
two
sixth
form
girls
were
in
a
line
with
her
then
with
a
sudden
spurt
of
which
she
had
hardly
believed
herself
capable
she
sprang
forward
kept
her
advantage
and
a
whole
yard
in
front
of
them
touched
the
ribbon
the
fourth
rent
the
air
with
their
cheers
the
trophy
was
by
far
the
most
important
event
of
the
afternoon
and
the
girl
who
had
secured
it
for
her
form
was
the
heroine
of
the
moment
too
much
out
of
breath
for
speech
but
conscious
of
her
honours
githa
walked
back
to
receive
the
congratulations
of
her
comrades
two
medals
and
the
trophy
she
could
scarcely
believe
her
good
fortune
boswell
with
smiling
face
had
turned
to
the
and
miss
andrews
was
marshalling
the
winners
in
the
order
of
their
events
the
poor
old
toadstool
looks
quite
pretty
for
once
said
jill
barton
as
githa
with
shining
eyes
and
cheeks
flushed
with
unwonted
colour
received
her
two
medals
and
the
charming
little
clock
which
would
henceforth
adorn
the
mantelpiece
of
the
fourth
form
room
when
she
through
her
ugly
duckling
stage
i
believe
she
turn
out
rather
handsome
agreed
ivy
parkins
i
always
said
she
had
good
features
only
she
looked
so
drab
and
depressed
her
expression
has
changed
lately
and
it
makes
an
immense
difference
she
does
scowl
like
she
used
to
do
it
was
indeed
such
a
bright
beaming
animated
girl
who
expressed
her
thanks
to
boswell
the
donor
of
the
clock
that
ledbury
looked
quite
amazed
she
beckoned
her
niece
to
her
side
illustration
concerns
us
very
much
githa
it
your
grandfather
last
will
come
here
githa
i
glad
to
see
you
do
so
well
i
want
you
to
speak
to
this
gentleman
indicating
the
officer
do
you
know
who
he
is
i
thought
not
well
it
a
surprise
for
us
all
but
as
githa
looked
up
into
the
kindly
face
turned
smilingly
down
to
greet
her
old
wellnigh
forgotten
scenes
of
early
childhood
came
rushing
back
and
with
a
swift
flash
half
of
intuition
half
of
memory
she
divined
the
truth
you
my
uncle
frank
she
exclaimed
later
on
in
the
afternoon
when
tea
was
over
and
the
visitors
were
dispersed
about
the
garden
githa
took
her
new
uncle
for
a
walk
in
the
orchard
she
did
not
feel
in
the
least
shy
with
him
and
clung
to
his
arm
stroking
the
khaki
sleeve
a
caress
she
would
never
have
dreamed
of
venturing
with
wilfred
ledbury
i
got
your
letter
all
right
that
what
brought
me
confided
uncle
frank
i
never
meant
to
show
my
face
in
heathwell
again
but
if
you
children
want
me
that
a
different
matter
so
you
think
you
like
to
live
with
me
you
young
witch
well
wait
till
the
war
over
and
see
what
can
be
managed
your
brother
tried
to
run
away
did
he
the
rascal
i
glad
he
ready
to
serve
his
country
the
navy
will
be
the
making
of
him
i
must
have
a
look
at
the
grange
for
old
sake
sake
now
tell
me
about
your
little
self
and
your
doings
then
somehow
githa
began
pouring
out
the
whole
story
of
the
last
few
weeks
happenings
including
the
finding
of
the
movable
panel
at
the
grange
and
ending
with
bob
gartley
confession
on
the
preceding
afternoon
her
uncle
listened
attentively
i
should
like
to
see
this
oak
cupboard
he
remarked
you
say
it
belongs
to
your
friend
katrine
the
sister
of
marsden
whom
i
met
in
hospital
would
she
show
it
to
us
now
i
sure
she
would
i
go
and
fetch
her
please
wait
for
me
here
githa
returned
in
a
few
minutes
with
both
katrine
and
gwethyn
they
were
anxious
to
make
captain
ledbury
acquaintance
and
to
ask
for
news
of
their
brother
hereward
the
account
of
his
progress
was
satisfactory
he
have
joined
his
regiment
again
by
now
i
expect
lucky
chap
he
was
on
the
list
so
had
no
need
to
be
invalided
home
oh
he
in
the
best
of
spirits
he
kept
us
all
alive
in
the
ward
with
his
jokes
never
met
such
a
fellow
for
making
puns
just
like
hereward
exclaimed
the
sisters
proudly
katrine
led
the
way
to
the
studio
and
did
the
honours
of
the
little
spice
cupboard
i
did
know
when
i
bought
it
that
it
came
originally
from
the
grange
she
explained
it
had
changed
hands
twice
before
i
got
possession
of
it
githa
and
i
spent
half
an
hour
or
more
over
it
yesterday
but
we
could
find
any
secret
place
added
gwethyn
captain
ledbury
had
stooped
down
and
was
making
a
careful
examination
he
pulled
out
all
the
small
drawers
and
felt
carefully
behind
them
i
dare
say
it
twenty
years
or
more
since
my
father
showed
me
how
this
works
i
almost
forgotten
the
trick
which
side
was
it
now
right
or
left
why
of
course
i
remember
you
push
both
together
it
rather
stiff
it
moving
oh
good
biz
a
thin
panel
of
wood
forming
the
back
of
the
recess
had
slid
aside
revealing
a
small
door
with
a
keyhole
it
refused
to
open
and
was
evidently
securely
locked
with
your
permission
miss
marsden
we
shall
have
to
do
a
little
burgling
remarked
captain
ledbury
perhaps
my
penknife
will
serve
as
a
oh
no
uncle
frank
cried
githa
do
force
it
wait
half
a
moment
i
got
it
here
in
my
pocket
look
try
this
the
key
that
i
found
inside
the
panel
at
the
grange
i
kept
it
most
carefully
in
case
i
should
ever
find
what
it
belonged
to
i
believe
you
solved
the
problem
murmured
her
uncle
all
watched
eagerly
as
captain
ledbury
made
trial
of
the
little
key
it
fitted
exactly
the
rusty
lock
creaked
as
it
turned
and
the
door
flew
open
the
space
revealed
was
very
narrow
there
was
only
just
room
for
a
fat
envelope
that
was
wedged
inside
uncle
frank
tore
the
letter
open
with
impatient
fingers
it
contained
a
pile
of
and
a
sheet
of
he
studied
the
latter
attentively
for
a
moment
or
two
then
he
turned
to
his
niece
this
concerns
us
very
much
githa
it
your
grandfather
last
will
duly
witnessed
and
apparently
in
good
order
you
and
cedric
and
myself
benefit
considerably
it
a
lucky
day
for
the
three
of
us
i
shall
keep
this
packet
and
place
it
at
once
in
the
hands
of
the
solicitor
who
is
named
as
executor
so
grandfather
had
forgotten
us
after
all
not
a
bit
of
it
you
come
in
for
a
very
nice
little
fortune
some
day
young
lady
this
is
better
than
winning
clocks
and
medals
i
never
won
anything
in
my
life
before
the
key
has
proved
my
mascot
this
afternoon
when
one
luck
turns
it
often
comes
with
a
rush
chuckled
uncle
frank
bob
gartley
really
told
the
truth
for
once
in
his
life
he
deserve
the
five
pounds
i
promised
him
he
shall
have
it
though
i
afraid
the
scoundrel
will
only
squander
it
at
the
perhaps
we
can
think
of
some
way
of
helping
the
wife
and
children
i
wish
i
could
persuade
him
to
enlist
the
discipline
of
the
army
is
just
what
he
needs
i
remember
him
very
well
when
he
was
a
lad
and
he
had
the
elements
of
good
stuff
in
him
then
pity
it
all
run
to
waste
one
never
knows
after
this
illness
a
completely
fresh
start
in
life
might
make
a
new
man
of
him
it
wonderful
what
serving
their
country
has
done
for
some
of
our
fellows
in
their
case
the
war
has
been
a
blessing
in
disguise
oh
it
would
be
glorious
if
he
go
for
a
soldier
agreed
githa
perhaps
he
will
if
you
talk
to
him
and
tell
him
about
what
going
on
at
the
front
what
a
good
thing
it
is
to
be
extravagant
sometimes
exclaimed
katrine
i
so
glad
i
bought
that
cupboard
from
stubbs
if
sold
it
to
a
dealer
in
london
the
secret
might
never
have
been
discovered
it
certainly
the
best
bargain
you
could
have
made
agreed
captain
ledbury
monday
morning
saw
the
bringing
out
of
travelling
trunks
and
a
corresponding
number
of
damsels
busy
with
the
joyful
employment
of
packing
to
go
home
rules
had
vanished
to
the
four
winds
and
the
girls
flitted
in
and
out
of
one
another
dormitories
and
talked
to
their
hearts
content
father
and
mother
will
be
home
in
ten
days
proclaimed
gwethyn
jubilantly
sitting
on
rose
randall
bed
amidst
a
litter
of
underlinen
we
to
go
and
stay
with
aunt
norah
until
they
come
mother
bring
me
the
cockatoo
she
says
they
so
noisy
and
such
a
nuisance
on
board
ship
but
she
got
another
surprise
for
me
only
it
not
alive
well
never
mind
perhaps
tony
would
have
liked
a
cockatoo
he
be
frightfully
jealous
if
i
set
up
another
pet
the
poor
darling
we
going
to
windermere
for
our
holidays
said
rose
wrapping
up
boots
and
stowing
them
inside
her
box
we
to
stay
at
a
house
close
to
the
lake
and
i
mean
to
learn
to
row
we
shall
be
off
to
our
country
cottage
in
north
wales
announced
beatrix
bates
and
bert
and
i
have
an
invitation
to
scotland
exulted
dona
matthews
girls
cried
jill
barton
bursting
suddenly
into
the
room
i
a
piece
of
news
to
tell
you
oh
such
news
you
never
guess
well
fire
away
someone
engaged
engaged
for
what
engaged
to
be
married
of
course
what
sillies
you
are
ca
you
guess
well
it
miss
aubrey
never
cried
the
owl
to
mr
freeman
oh
i
say
hold
me
up
not
really
freeman
why
he
ever
so
old
not
so
very
interrupted
gwethyn
taking
up
the
cudgels
for
her
artist
friend
he
only
rather
grey
and
of
course
miss
aubrey
is
very
young
herself
though
she
a
dear
i
immensely
glad
why
so
are
we
all
i
hope
she
have
the
wedding
during
so
that
we
can
go
and
see
her
married
would
we
cheer
her
and
throw
rice
and
old
slippers
just
i
do
fancy
anything
fixed
yet
the
engagement
is
only
just
announced
it
will
be
franklin
turn
next
perhaps
no
no
surely
ermengarde
would
permit
it
besides
what
would
become
of
the
school
joking
apart
we
shall
miss
miss
aubrey
dreadfully
gwethyn
who
rushed
to
impart
the
interesting
news
to
her
sister
found
katrine
kneeling
on
the
floor
of
their
bedroom
packing
canvases
it
will
be
our
gain
was
the
latter
comment
because
i
suppose
miss
aubrey
will
come
to
live
at
hartfield
when
she
married
to
freeman
how
lovely
to
have
her
so
near
i
shall
often
run
in
and
have
talks
with
her
it
something
to
look
forward
to
gwethyn
i
decided
to
give
my
picture
of
the
old
spice
cupboard
as
a
present
to
githa
i
believe
she
like
to
have
it
katrine
looked
with
a
sigh
at
her
portraits
of
granny
blundell
and
little
hugh
gartley
the
ambitious
hope
which
she
had
cherished
in
connection
with
them
had
fallen
to
the
ground
she
had
shown
the
painting
to
freeman
but
he
had
not
encouraged
her
to
submit
it
to
the
hanging
committee
of
any
art
gallery
your
work
is
still
too
crude
and
immature
for
exhibition
child
he
had
said
kindly
but
truthfully
you
need
to
go
and
study
and
learn
many
things
persevere
and
keep
pegging
away
and
you
do
well
in
course
of
time
i
dare
say
art
needs
an
apprenticeship
as
much
as
anything
else
the
old
masters
themselves
began
as
pupils
in
the
workshops
of
others
leaving
her
masterpiece
out
of
the
question
katrine
had
quite
a
nice
little
collection
of
sketches
to
take
home
with
