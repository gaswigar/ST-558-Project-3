chapter
i
hear
bad
news
here
it
was
ranck
s
voice
and
sounded
more
bitter
and
stringent
than
usual
i
can
easily
recall
the
little
room
in
which
i
sat
poring
over
my
next
day
s
lessons
it
was
in
one
end
of
the
attic
of
our
modest
cottage
and
the
only
room
done
off
upstairs
the
sloping
side
walls
that
followed
the
lines
of
the
roof
were
bare
except
for
the
numerous
pictures
of
yachts
and
other
sailing
craft
with
which
i
had
plastered
them
from
time
to
time
there
was
a
bed
at
one
side
and
a
small
deal
table
at
the
other
and
over
the
little
window
was
a
shelf
whereon
i
kept
my
meager
collection
of
books
sam
are
you
coming
or
not
with
a
sigh
i
laid
down
my
book
opened
the
door
and
descended
the
steep
uncarpeted
stairs
to
the
lower
room
this
was
ranck
s
where
she
cooked
our
meals
laid
the
table
and
sat
in
her
wooden
rocker
to
darn
and
mend
it
was
a
big
square
room
which
took
up
most
of
the
space
in
the
lower
part
of
the
house
leaving
only
a
place
for
a
small
at
one
end
and
the
captain
s
room
at
the
other
at
one
side
was
the
low
broad
porch
with
a
door
and
two
windows
opening
onto
it
and
at
the
other
side
which
was
properly
the
back
of
the
cottage
a
small
wing
had
been
built
which
was
occupied
by
the
housekeeper
as
her
sleeping
chamber
as
i
entered
the
in
response
to
ranck
s
summons
i
was
surprised
to
find
a
stranger
there
seated
stiffly
upon
the
edge
of
one
of
the
straight
chairs
and
holding
his
hat
in
his
lap
where
he
grasped
it
tightly
with
two
big
red
fists
as
if
afraid
that
it
would
get
away
he
wore
an
old
flannel
shirt
open
at
the
neck
and
a
and
aside
from
these
of
his
profession
it
was
easy
enough
to
determine
from
his
air
and
manner
that
he
was
a
man
there
was
nothing
remarkable
about
that
for
every
one
in
our
little
village
of
batteraft
got
a
living
from
old
ocean
in
one
way
or
another
but
what
startled
me
was
to
find
ranck
confronting
the
sailor
with
a
white
face
and
a
look
of
mingled
terror
and
anxiety
in
her
small
gray
eyes
what
is
it
aunt
i
asked
a
sudden
fear
striking
to
my
heart
as
i
looked
from
one
to
the
other
in
my
perplexity
the
woman
did
not
reply
at
first
but
continued
to
stare
wildly
at
the
bowed
head
of
the
because
he
was
embarrassed
and
ill
at
ease
but
when
he
chanced
to
raise
a
rather
appealing
pair
of
eyes
to
her
face
she
nodded
and
said
briefly
tell
yes
marm
answered
the
man
but
he
shifted
uneasily
in
his
seat
and
seemed
disinclined
to
proceed
further
all
this
began
to
make
me
very
nervous
perhaps
the
man
was
a
bearer
of
news
and
if
so
his
tale
must
have
an
evil
complexion
to
judge
by
his
manner
and
ranck
s
stern
face
i
felt
like
shrinking
back
like
running
away
from
some
calamity
that
was
about
to
overtake
me
but
i
did
not
run
boy
though
i
was
and
very
inexperienced
in
the
ways
of
life
with
its
troubles
and
tribulations
i
knew
that
i
must
stay
and
hear
all
and
i
braced
myself
for
the
ordeal
tell
me
please
i
said
and
my
voice
was
so
husky
and
low
that
i
could
scarce
hear
it
myself
tell
me
it
father
the
man
nodded
it
s
about
the
cap
n
he
said
looking
stolidly
into
ranck
s
cold
features
as
if
striving
to
find
in
them
some
assistance
i
was
one
as
sailed
with
him
las
may
aboard
the
then
why
are
you
here
i
cried
desperately
although
even
as
i
spoke
there
flashed
across
my
mind
a
first
realization
of
the
horror
the
answer
was
bound
to
convey
cause
the
saracen
foundered
off
lucayas
said
the
sailor
with
blunt
deliberation
an
went
to
the
bottom
th
all
but
me
that
is
i
caught
a
spar
an
floated
three
days
an
four
nights
makin
at
last
andros
isle
where
a
fisherman
pulled
me
ashore
more
dead
n
alive
that
s
nigh
three
months
agone
sir
i
ve
had
fever
fever
they
called
i
couldn
t
bring
the
news
i
felt
my
body
swaying
slightly
and
wondered
if
it
would
fall
then
i
caught
at
a
ray
of
hope
but
my
father
captain
steele
perhaps
he
also
floated
ashore
i
gasped
the
sailor
shook
his
head
regretfully
none
but
me
was
saved
alive
sir
he
answered
in
a
solemn
voice
the
tide
cast
up
a
many
o
the
saracen
corpses
while
i
lay
in
the
fever
an
the
fisher
folks
give
em
a
decent
burial
but
they
saved
the
trinkets
as
was
found
on
the
dead
men
an
among
em
was
cap
n
steele
s
watch
an
ring
i
kep
em
to
bring
to
you
here
they
be
he
continued
simply
as
he
rose
from
his
chair
to
place
a
small
chamois
bag
reverently
upon
the
table
ranck
pounced
upon
it
and
with
trembling
fingers
untied
the
string
then
she
drew
forth
my
father
s
round
silver
watch
and
the
carbuncle
ring
he
had
worn
upon
his
little
finger
ever
since
i
could
remember
for
a
time
no
one
spoke
i
stared
stupidly
at
the
sailor
noticing
that
the
buttons
on
his
did
not
match
and
wondering
if
he
always
sewed
them
on
himself
ranck
had
fallen
back
into
her
tall
where
she
gyrated
nervously
back
and
forth
the
left
rocker
creaking
as
if
it
needed
greasing
why
was
it
that
i
could
not
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
or
wail
or
shriek
or
do
anything
to
prove
that
i
realized
myself
suddenly
bereft
of
the
only
friend
i
had
in
all
the
world
there
was
an
iron
band
around
my
forehead
and
another
around
my
chest
my
brain
was
throbbing
under
one
and
my
heart
trying
desperately
to
beat
under
the
other
yet
outwardly
i
must
have
appeared
calm
enough
and
the
fact
filled
me
with
shame
and
disgust
an
orphan
now
and
alone
in
the
world
this
father
whom
the
angry
seas
had
engulfed
was
the
only
relative
i
had
known
since
my
sweet
little
mother
wearied
of
the
world
and
sought
refuge
in
heaven
years
and
years
ago
and
while
father
sailed
away
on
his
stout
ship
the
saracen
i
was
left
to
the
care
of
the
hard
working
but
crabbed
and
cross
old
woman
whom
i
had
come
to
call
through
courtesy
and
convenience
aunt
although
she
was
no
relation
whatever
to
me
now
i
was
alone
in
the
world
father
bluff
and
rugged
so
strong
and
resourceful
that
i
had
seldom
entertained
a
fear
for
his
safety
was
lying
dead
in
the
far
away
island
of
andros
and
his
boy
must
hereafter
learn
to
live
without
him
the
sailor
obviously
uneasy
at
the
effect
of
his
ill
tidings
now
rose
to
go
but
at
his
motion
ranck
seemed
suddenly
to
recover
the
use
of
her
tongue
and
sternly
bade
him
resume
his
seat
then
she
plied
him
with
questions
concerning
the
storm
and
the
catastrophe
that
followed
it
and
the
man
answered
to
the
best
of
his
ability
captain
steele
was
universally
acknowledged
one
of
the
best
and
most
successful
seamen
batteraft
had
ever
known
through
many
years
of
trading
in
foreign
parts
he
had
not
only
become
sole
owner
of
the
saracen
but
had
amassed
a
fortune
which
it
was
freely
stated
in
the
town
was
enough
to
satisfy
the
desires
of
any
man
but
this
was
merely
on
the
part
of
his
neighbors
for
when
ashore
the
old
sailor
confided
his
affairs
to
no
one
unless
it
might
have
been
to
ranck
for
the
housekeeper
was
a
different
person
when
the
captain
was
ashore
recounting
her
own
virtues
so
persistently
and
seeming
so
solicitous
for
my
comfort
that
poor
father
stood
somewhat
in
awe
of
her
exceptional
nobility
of
character
as
soon
as
he
had
sailed
she
dropped
the
mask
and
was
often
unkind
but
i
never
minded
this
enough
to
worry
him
with
complaints
so
he
was
unconscious
of
her
true
nature
indeed
my
dear
father
had
been
so
seldom
at
home
that
i
dreaded
to
cause
him
one
moment
s
uneasiness
he
was
a
reserved
man
too
as
is
the
case
with
so
many
sailors
and
since
the
death
of
his
dearly
loved
wife
had
passed
but
little
of
his
time
ashore
i
am
sure
he
loved
me
for
he
always
treated
me
with
a
rare
tenderness
but
he
never
would
listen
to
my
entreaties
to
sail
with
him
the
sea
s
no
place
for
a
lad
that
has
a
comfortable
home
he
used
to
reply
in
his
slow
thoughtful
way
keep
to
your
studies
sam
my
boy
and
you
ll
be
a
bigger
man
some
day
than
any
seaman
of
us
the
captain
s
brief
visits
home
were
the
only
bright
spots
in
my
existence
and
because
i
had
no
one
else
to
love
i
lavished
upon
my
one
parent
all
the
affection
of
which
i
was
capable
therefore
my
present
sudden
bereavement
was
so
colossal
and
far
reaching
in
its
effects
upon
my
young
life
that
it
is
no
wonder
the
news
staggered
me
and
curiously
dulled
my
senses
almost
as
if
in
a
dream
i
heard
ranck
s
fierce
questions
and
the
sailor
s
reluctant
answers
and
when
he
had
told
everything
that
he
knew
about
the
matter
he
got
upon
his
feet
and
took
my
hands
gently
in
both
his
big
calloused
ones
i
m
right
sorry
lad
as
ye
ve
had
this
blow
he
muttered
feelingly
the
cap
n
were
a
good
man
an
a
kind
master
an
many
s
a
time
i
ve
heard
him
tell
of
his
boy
sam
i
s
pose
he
s
left
ye
provided
with
plenty
o
this
world
s
goods
for
he
were
a
thrifty
man
and
mostly
in
luck
but
if
ye
ever
run
aground
lad
or
find
ye
need
a
friend
to
cast
a
bowline
don
t
ye
forget
that
ned
britton
ll
stand
by
ye
through
thick
an
thin
with
this
he
wrung
my
hands
until
i
winced
under
the
pressure
and
then
he
nodded
briefly
to
ranck
and
hurried
from
the
room
the
twilight
had
faded
during
the
interview
and
the
housekeeper
had
lit
a
tallow
candle
as
ned
britton
s
footsteps
died
away
the
woman
bent
forward
to
snuff
the
wick
and
i
noted
a
grim
and
determined
look
upon
her
features
that
was
new
to
them
but
her
hands
trembled
somewhat
in
spite
of
her
assumed
calmness
and
the
fact
gave
me
a
certain
satisfaction
her
loss
could
not
be
compared
with
mine
but
the
captain
s
death
was
sure
to
bring
about
a
change
in
her
fortunes
as
well
as
my
own
she
resumed
her
regular
rocking
back
and
forth
riveting
her
eyes
the
while
upon
my
face
i
did
not
sit
but
leaned
against
the
table
trying
hard
to
think
and
thus
for
a
long
time
we
regarded
each
other
in
silence
finally
she
cried
out
sharply
well
what
are
you
to
do
now
in
what
way
i
asked
drearily
in
every
way
how
are
you
goin
to
live
fer
one
thing
why
much
the
same
as
i
am
doing
now
i
suppose
said
i
trying
to
rouse
myself
to
attend
to
what
she
was
saying
father
owned
this
house
which
is
now
mine
and
i
m
sure
there
is
considerable
property
besides
although
the
ship
is
fiddlesticks
exclaimed
ranck
scornfully
i
wondered
what
she
meant
by
that
and
looked
my
question
your
father
didn
t
own
a
stick
o
this
house
she
cried
in
a
tone
that
was
almost
a
scream
it
s
mine
an
the
deed
s
in
my
own
name
i
know
i
replied
but
father
has
often
explained
that
you
merely
held
the
deed
in
trust
for
me
until
i
became
of
age
he
turned
it
over
to
you
as
a
protection
to
me
in
case
some
accident
should
happen
to
him
many
times
he
has
told
me
that
this
plan
insured
my
having
a
home
no
matter
what
i
guess
you
didn
t
understand
him
she
answered
an
evil
flash
in
her
eye
the
facts
is
this
house
were
put
into
my
name
because
the
cap
n
owed
me
what
for
i
asked
i
ve
kep
ye
in
food
an
clothes
ever
sence
ye
was
a
baby
do
ye
s
pose
that
don
t
cost
money
i
stared
at
her
bewildered
didn
t
father
furnish
the
money
not
a
cent
he
jest
let
it
run
on
as
he
did
any
wages
an
it
counts
up
big
that
then
the
house
isn
t
mine
after
all
not
an
inch
of
it
not
a
stick
ner
a
i
tried
to
think
what
this
would
mean
to
me
and
what
reason
the
woman
could
have
for
claiming
a
right
to
my
inheritance
once
said
i
musingly
father
told
me
how
he
had
brought
you
here
to
save
you
from
the
or
starvation
he
was
sorry
for
you
and
gave
you
a
home
that
was
while
mother
was
living
afterwards
he
said
he
trusted
to
your
gratitude
to
take
good
care
of
me
and
to
stand
my
friend
in
place
of
my
dead
fiddlesticks
she
snapped
again
it
was
the
word
she
usually
used
to
express
contempt
and
it
sounded
very
disagreeable
coming
from
her
lips
the
cap
n
must
a
been
when
he
told
you
that
stuff
an
nonsense
she
went
on
i
ve
treated
ye
like
my
own
son
there
s
no
mistake
about
that
but
i
did
it
for
wages
accordin
to
agreement
atween
me
an
the
cap
n
an
the
wages
wasn
t
never
paid
when
they
got
to
be
a
big
lump
he
put
the
house
in
my
name
to
secure
me
an
it
s
ry
stick
of
it
my
head
was
aching
and
i
had
to
press
my
hand
to
it
to
ease
the
pain
in
the
light
of
the
one
flickering
candle
ranck
s
hard
face
assumed
the
expression
of
a
triumphant
demon
and
i
drew
back
from
it
shocked
and
repelled
if
what
you
say
is
true
i
said
listlessly
i
would
rather
you
take
the
old
home
to
wipe
out
the
debt
yet
father
surely
told
me
it
was
mine
and
it
isn
t
like
him
to
deceive
me
or
to
owe
any
one
money
however
take
it
aunt
if
you
i
ve
got
it
she
answered
an
i
mean
to
keep
i
shall
get
along
very
well
said
i
thinking
indeed
that
nothing
mattered
much
now
father
was
gone
how
will
you
live
she
enquired
why
there
s
plenty
besides
the
house
i
replied
in
father
s
room
and
i
nodded
my
head
toward
the
door
that
was
always
kept
locked
in
the
captain
s
absence
there
must
be
a
great
many
valuable
things
stored
the
very
last
time
he
was
home
he
said
that
in
case
anything
ever
happened
to
him
i
would
find
a
little
fortune
in
his
old
may
be
rejoined
the
old
woman
uneasily
i
hope
story
o
his
n
at
least
is
true
for
your
sake
sam
i
hain
t
anything
agin
you
but
right
is
right
an
the
house
don
t
cover
all
that
s
comin
to
me
either
the
cap
n
owed
me
four
hundred
dollars
besides
the
house
for
your
keep
durin
all
these
years
an
that
ll
have
to
be
paid
afore
you
can
honestly
lay
claim
to
a
cent
o
his
of
course
i
agreed
meekly
enough
for
all
this
talk
of
money
wearied
me
but
there
should
be
much
more
than
that
in
the
chest
alone
according
to
what
father
let
s
hope
there
is
said
she
you
go
to
bed
now
for
you
re
clean
done
up
an
no
wonder
in
the
mornin
we
ll
both
look
into
the
cap
n
s
room
an
see
what
s
there
i
ain
t
to
take
no
mean
advantage
o
you
sam
you
can
depend
on
t
so
go
to
bed
sleep
s
the
best
fer
troubles
like
this
last
was
said
in
a
more
kindly
tone
and
i
was
glad
to
take
her
at
her
word
and
creep
away
to
my
little
room
in
the
attic
chapter
ii
i
find
a
relative
it
may
have
been
hours
that
i
sat
at
my
little
table
overcome
by
the
bitterness
of
my
loss
and
for
more
hours
i
tossed
restlessly
upon
my
hard
bed
striving
in
vain
for
comfort
but
suddenly
as
i
recalled
a
little
affectionate
gesture
of
my
father
s
i
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
and
oh
what
a
relief
it
was
to
be
able
to
sob
away
the
load
that
had
overburdened
my
young
heart
after
that
last
paroxysm
of
grief
i
fell
asleep
worn
out
by
my
own
emotions
and
it
was
long
past
my
usual
hour
for
rising
that
i
finally
awoke
in
a
moment
as
i
lay
staring
at
the
bright
morning
sunshine
the
sorrow
that
had
been
forgotten
in
sleep
swept
over
me
like
a
flood
and
i
wept
again
at
the
thought
of
my
utter
loneliness
and
the
dreadful
fate
that
had
overtaken
my
dear
father
but
presently
with
the
elasticity
of
youth
i
was
enabled
to
control
myself
and
turn
my
thoughts
toward
the
future
then
i
remembered
that
ranck
and
i
were
to
enter
the
captain
s
locked
room
and
take
an
inventory
of
his
possessions
and
i
began
hurriedly
to
dress
myself
that
this
sad
duty
might
be
accomplished
as
soon
as
possible
the
recollection
of
the
woman
s
preposterous
claims
moved
me
to
sullen
anger
it
seemed
like
a
reflection
on
father
s
honesty
to
claim
that
he
had
been
in
her
debt
all
these
years
and
i
resolved
that
she
should
be
paid
every
penny
she
demanded
that
the
captain
s
honor
might
remain
untarnished
in
death
even
as
it
had
ever
been
during
his
lifetime
as
soon
as
i
was
ready
i
descended
the
stairs
to
the
living
room
where
ranck
sat
rocking
in
her
chair
just
as
i
had
left
her
the
night
before
she
was
always
an
early
riser
and
i
noticed
that
she
had
eaten
her
own
breakfast
and
left
a
piece
of
bacon
and
for
me
upon
the
hearth
she
made
no
reply
to
my
good
morning
aunt
so
i
took
the
plate
from
the
hearth
and
ate
my
breakfast
in
silence
i
was
not
at
all
hungry
but
i
was
young
and
felt
the
need
of
food
not
until
i
had
finished
did
ranck
speak
we
may
as
well
look
into
the
cap
n
s
room
an
get
it
done
with
she
said
it
s
only
nat
ral
as
i
should
want
to
know
if
i
m
goin
to
get
the
money
back
i
ve
spent
on
your
keepin
very
well
said
i
she
went
to
a
drawer
of
a
tall
bureau
and
drew
out
a
small
ivory
box
within
this
i
knew
were
the
keys
belonging
to
my
father
never
before
had
ranck
dared
to
meddle
with
them
for
the
captain
had
always
forbidden
her
and
everyone
else
to
enter
his
room
during
his
absence
even
now
when
he
was
dead
it
seemed
like
disobedience
of
his
wishes
for
the
woman
to
seize
the
keys
and
march
over
to
the
door
of
the
sacred
room
in
a
moment
she
had
turned
the
lock
and
thrown
open
the
door
shy
and
half
startled
at
our
presumption
i
approached
and
peered
over
her
shoulder
occasionally
indeed
i
had
had
a
glimpse
of
the
interior
of
this
little
place
half
chamber
and
half
office
and
once
or
twice
when
a
little
child
i
had
entered
it
to
seek
my
father
now
as
i
glanced
within
it
seemed
to
be
in
perfect
order
but
it
struck
me
as
more
bare
and
unfurnished
than
i
had
ever
seen
it
before
father
must
have
secretly
removed
many
of
the
boxes
that
used
to
line
the
walls
for
they
were
all
gone
except
his
big
the
sight
of
the
chest
however
reassured
me
for
it
was
in
this
that
he
had
told
me
to
look
for
my
fortune
in
case
anything
should
happen
to
him
the
old
woman
at
once
walked
over
to
the
chest
and
taking
a
smaller
key
from
the
ivory
box
fitted
it
to
the
lock
and
threw
back
the
lid
with
a
bang
there
s
your
fortune
she
said
with
a
sneer
see
if
you
can
find
i
bent
over
the
chest
gazing
eagerly
into
its
depths
there
was
an
old
bible
in
one
end
and
a
broken
compass
in
the
other
but
that
was
all
standing
at
one
side
the
woman
looked
into
my
astonished
face
and
laughed
mockingly
this
was
another
o
the
cap
n
s
lies
she
said
he
lied
to
you
about
ownin
the
house
he
lied
to
you
about
takin
me
out
o
charity
an
he
lied
to
you
about
the
fortune
in
this
chest
an
easy
liar
was
cap
n
steele
i
must
say
i
shrank
back
looking
into
her
exultant
eyes
with
horror
in
my
own
how
dare
you
say
such
things
about
my
father
i
cried
in
anger
how
dare
i
she
retorted
why
because
they
re
true
as
you
can
see
for
yourself
your
father
s
deceived
you
an
he
s
deceived
me
i
ve
paid
out
over
four
hundred
dollars
for
your
keep
thinkin
there
was
enough
in
this
room
to
pay
me
back
an
now
i
stand
to
lose
every
penny
of
it
jest
because
i
trusted
to
a
lyin
you
won
t
lose
a
dollar
i
cried
indignantly
while
i
struggled
to
keep
back
the
tears
of
disappointment
and
shame
that
rushed
to
my
eyes
i
ll
pay
you
every
cent
of
the
money
if
i
she
looked
at
me
curiously
with
a
half
smile
upon
her
thin
lips
how
she
asked
i
ll
work
and
earn
pish
what
can
a
boy
like
you
earn
an
what
s
goin
to
happen
while
you
re
earnin
it
one
thing
s
certain
sam
steele
you
can
t
stay
here
an
live
off
n
a
poor
lone
woman
that
s
lost
four
hundred
dollars
by
you
already
you
ll
have
to
find
another
i
ll
do
that
i
said
promptly
you
can
have
three
days
to
git
out
she
continued
pushing
me
out
of
the
room
and
relocking
the
door
although
there
was
little
reason
for
that
and
you
can
take
whatever
clothes
you
ve
got
along
with
you
nobody
can
say
that
jane
ranck
ain
t
acted
like
a
christian
to
ye
even
if
she
s
beat
an
defrauded
out
n
her
just
rights
but
if
ye
should
happen
to
earn
any
money
sam
i
hope
you
ll
remember
what
ye
owe
i
will
said
i
coldly
and
i
meant
it
to
my
surprise
ranck
gave
a
strange
chuckle
which
was
doubtless
meant
for
a
first
i
had
ever
known
her
to
indulge
in
it
fired
my
indignation
to
such
a
point
that
i
cried
out
shame
and
seizing
my
cap
i
rushed
from
the
house
the
cottage
was
built
upon
a
small
hill
facing
the
bay
and
was
fully
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
from
the
edge
of
the
village
of
batteraft
from
our
gate
the
path
led
down
hill
through
a
little
group
of
trees
and
then
split
in
twain
one
branch
running
down
to
the
beach
where
the
shipping
lay
and
the
other
crossing
the
meadows
to
the
village
among
the
trees
my
father
had
built
a
board
bench
overlooking
the
bay
and
here
i
have
known
him
to
sit
for
hours
enjoying
the
beauty
of
the
view
while
the
leafy
trees
overhead
shaded
him
from
the
hot
sun
it
was
toward
this
bench
a
favorite
resort
of
mine
because
my
father
loved
it
that
i
directed
my
steps
on
leaving
ranck
at
the
moment
i
was
dazed
by
the
amazing
discovery
of
my
impoverished
condition
and
this
following
so
suddenly
upon
the
loss
of
my
father
nearly
overwhelmed
me
with
despair
but
i
knew
that
prompt
action
on
my
part
was
necessary
for
the
woman
had
only
given
me
three
days
grace
and
my
pride
would
not
suffer
me
to
remain
that
long
in
a
home
where
my
presence
was
declared
a
burden
so
i
would
sit
beneath
the
trees
and
try
to
decide
where
to
go
and
what
to
do
but
as
i
approached
the
place
i
found
to
my
astonishment
that
a
man
was
already
seated
upon
the
bench
he
was
doubtless
a
stranger
in
batteraft
for
i
had
never
seen
him
before
so
that
i
moderated
my
pace
and
approached
him
slowly
thinking
he
might
discover
he
was
on
private
grounds
and
take
his
leave
he
paid
no
attention
to
me
being
engaged
in
whittling
a
stick
with
a
big
in
appearance
he
was
short
and
of
middle
age
his
round
face
was
lined
in
every
direction
by
deep
wrinkles
and
the
scant
hair
that
showed
upon
his
temples
was
thin
and
grey
he
wore
a
blue
flannel
shirt
with
a
black
kerchief
knotted
at
the
throat
but
aside
from
this
his
dress
was
that
of
an
ordinary
civilian
so
that
at
first
i
was
unable
to
decide
whether
he
was
a
sailor
or
a
landsman
the
chief
attraction
in
the
stranger
was
the
expression
of
his
face
which
was
remarkably
humorous
although
i
was
close
by
him
now
he
paid
no
attention
to
my
presence
but
as
he
whittled
away
industriously
he
gave
vent
to
several
half
audible
chuckles
that
seemed
to
indicate
that
his
thoughts
were
very
amusing
i
was
about
to
pass
him
and
go
down
to
the
beach
where
i
might
find
a
solitary
spot
for
my
musings
when
the
man
turned
his
eyes
up
to
mine
and
gave
a
wink
that
seemed
both
mysterious
and
confidential
it
s
sam
ain
t
it
he
asked
with
another
silent
chuckle
yes
sir
i
replied
resenting
his
familiarity
while
i
wondered
how
he
should
know
me
cap
n
steele
s
son
i
m
guessin
he
continued
the
same
sir
and
i
made
a
movement
to
pass
on
sit
down
sam
there
s
no
hurry
and
he
pointed
to
the
bench
beside
him
i
obeyed
wondering
what
he
could
want
with
me
half
turning
toward
me
he
gave
another
of
those
curious
winks
and
then
suddenly
turned
grave
and
resumed
his
whittling
may
i
ask
who
you
are
sir
i
enquired
no
harm
in
that
he
replied
with
a
smile
that
lighted
his
wrinkled
face
most
comically
no
harm
in
the
world
i
m
naboth
oh
said
i
without
much
interest
never
heard
that
name
before
i
take
it
no
do
you
remember
your
mother
not
very
well
sir
i
answered
wondering
more
and
more
i
was
little
more
than
a
baby
when
she
died
you
i
know
and
he
nodded
and
gave
an
odd
sort
of
grunt
did
you
ever
hear
what
her
name
was
afore
she
married
the
cap
n
oh
yes
i
cried
suddenly
enlightened
it
was
mary
then
my
heart
fluttering
wildly
i
turned
an
intent
and
appealing
gaze
upon
the
little
man
beside
me
naboth
perkins
was
seized
with
another
of
those
queer
fits
of
silent
merriment
and
his
shoulders
bobbed
up
and
down
until
a
cough
caught
him
and
for
a
time
i
feared
he
would
choke
to
death
before
he
could
control
the
convulsions
but
at
last
he
recovered
and
wiped
the
tears
from
his
eyes
with
a
brilliant
red
handkerchief
i
m
your
uncle
lad
he
said
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
this
was
news
indeed
but
news
that
puzzled
me
exceedingly
why
have
i
never
heard
of
you
before
i
asked
soberly
haven
t
ye
he
returned
with
evident
surprise
he
looked
the
stick
over
carefully
and
cut
another
notch
in
it
well
for
one
thing
he
remarked
i
ve
never
been
in
these
parts
afore
sence
the
day
i
was
born
fer
another
thing
it
stands
to
reason
you
was
too
young
to
remember
even
if
mary
had
talked
to
ye
about
her
only
brother
afore
she
died
an
quit
this
ere
sublunatic
spear
an
fer
a
third
an
last
reason
cap
n
steele
were
a
man
that
had
little
to
say
about
most
things
so
it
s
fair
to
s
pose
he
had
less
to
say
about
his
relations
eh
perhaps
it
is
as
you
say
quite
likely
yet
it
s
mighty
funny
the
cap
n
never
let
drop
a
word
about
me
good
or
were
you
my
father
s
friend
i
asked
anxiously
that
s
as
may
be
said
perkins
evasively
friends
is
all
kinds
from
acquaintances
to
lovers
but
the
cap
n
an
me
wasn
t
enemies
by
a
long
shot
an
i
ve
been
his
partner
these
ten
year
his
partner
i
echoed
astonished
the
little
man
nodded
his
partner
he
repeated
with
much
complacency
but
our
dealin
s
together
was
all
on
a
strict
business
basis
we
didn
t
hobnob
ner
gossip
ner
slap
each
other
on
the
back
so
as
fer
saying
we
was
exactly
y
i
can
t
honestly
do
it
i
understand
said
i
accepting
his
explanation
in
good
faith
i
came
here
at
this
time
continued
perkins
addressing
his
speech
to
the
which
he
held
upon
the
palm
of
his
hand
to
see
cap
n
steele
on
an
important
business
matter
he
had
agreed
to
meet
me
but
i
saw
ned
britton
at
the
tavern
las
night
an
heerd
fer
the
first
time
that
the
saracen
had
gone
to
davy
jones
an
took
the
cap
n
with
her
so
i
come
up
here
to
have
a
little
talk
with
you
which
is
his
son
and
my
own
why
didn
t
you
come
up
to
the
house
i
enquired
perkins
turned
upon
me
his
peculiar
wink
and
his
shoulders
began
to
shake
again
till
i
feared
more
convulsions
but
he
suddenly
stopped
short
and
with
abrupt
gravity
nodded
his
head
at
me
several
times
the
woman
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
jest
can
t
abide
women
specially
when
they
s
old
an
given
to
argument
as
ned
britton
says
this
one
i
sympathized
with
him
and
said
so
whereat
my
uncle
gave
me
a
look
gentle
and
kindly
and
said
in
a
friendly
tone
sam
my
boy
i
want
to
tell
you
all
about
myself
that
s
your
blood
uncle
an
no
mistake
but
first
i
want
you
to
tell
me
all
about
yourself
you
re
an
orphan
now
an
my
dead
sister
s
child
an
i
take
it
i
m
the
only
real
friend
you
ve
got
in
the
world
so
now
fire
away
there
was
something
about
the
personality
of
naboth
perkins
that
invited
confidence
or
perhaps
it
was
my
loneliness
and
need
of
a
friend
that
led
me
to
accept
this
astonishing
uncle
in
good
faith
anyway
i
did
not
hesitate
to
tell
him
my
whole
story
including
my
recent
grief
at
the
news
of
my
dear
father
s
death
and
the
startling
discovery
i
had
just
made
that
i
was
penniless
and
in
debt
for
my
living
to
ranck
father
has
often
told
me
i
concluded
that
the
house
was
mine
and
had
been
put
in
ranck
s
name
because
he
felt
she
was
honest
and
would
guard
my
interests
in
his
absence
and
he
told
me
there
was
a
store
of
valuable
articles
in
his
room
which
he
had
been
accumulating
for
years
and
that
the
old
alone
contained
enough
to
make
me
independent
but
when
we
examined
the
room
this
morning
everything
was
gone
and
the
chest
was
empty
i
don
t
know
what
to
think
about
it
i
m
sure
for
father
never
lied
in
spite
of
what
ranck
uncle
naboth
whistled
a
sailor
s
hornpipe
in
a
slow
jerky
and
altogether
dismal
fashion
when
it
was
quite
finished
even
to
the
last
quavering
bar
he
said
sam
who
kept
the
keys
to
the
room
an
the
chest
mrs
was
the
room
dark
an
all
covered
over
with
dust
when
you
went
in
there
this
mornin
don
t
think
it
was
i
answered
trying
to
recollect
no
i
remember
now
the
blind
was
wide
open
and
the
room
looked
clean
and
in
good
sailors
remarked
perkins
impressively
never
is
known
to
keep
their
rooms
in
good
order
the
cap
n
been
gone
five
months
an
more
if
all
was
straight
the
dust
would
be
thick
on
to
be
sure
said
i
very
gravely
then
sam
it
stands
to
reason
the
ol
woman
went
inter
the
room
while
you
was
asleep
an
took
out
everything
she
could
lay
her
hands
on
cap
n
steele
didn
t
lie
to
you
my
boy
but
he
made
the
mistake
of
thinkin
the
woman
honest
she
took
advantage
of
the
fact
that
the
cap
n
was
dead
an
couldn
t
prove
nothin
and
so
she
robbed
the
suspicion
had
crossed
my
mind
before
and
i
was
not
greatly
surprised
to
hear
my
uncle
voice
it
then
can
t
we
make
her
give
it
up
i
asked
if
she
has
done
such
a
wicked
thing
it
seems
as
though
we
ought
to
accuse
her
of
it
and
make
her
give
me
all
that
belongs
to
uncle
naboth
rose
slowly
from
the
bench
settled
his
felt
hat
firmly
upon
his
head
pulled
down
his
checkered
vest
and
assumed
a
most
determined
bearing
you
wait
here
he
said
an
i
ll
beard
the
in
her
den
an
see
what
can
be
then
he
gave
a
great
sigh
and
turning
square
around
marched
stiffly
up
the
path
that
led
to
the
house
chapter
iii
my
fortunes
improve
i
awaited
with
as
much
patience
as
i
could
muster
the
result
of
the
venture
i
was
proud
of
uncle
naboth
s
bravery
and
hoped
he
would
be
successful
surely
the
brief
interview
with
my
newly
acquired
relative
had
caused
a
great
change
in
my
future
prospects
for
it
was
not
likely
that
my
mother
s
brother
would
desert
me
in
my
extremity
i
had
left
the
house
that
was
now
no
longer
my
home
without
a
single
friend
to
whom
i
could
turn
and
behold
here
was
a
champion
waiting
to
espouse
my
cause
perkins
was
somewhat
peculiar
in
his
actions
it
is
true
but
he
was
my
uncle
and
my
dead
father
s
partner
and
already
i
was
beginning
to
have
faith
in
him
it
was
a
full
half
hour
before
i
saw
him
coming
back
along
the
path
but
now
he
no
longer
strutted
with
proud
determination
instead
his
whole
stout
little
body
drooped
despondently
his
hat
was
thrust
back
from
his
forehead
and
upon
his
deeply
wrinkled
face
stood
big
drops
of
perspiration
sam
said
he
standing
before
me
with
a
rather
sheepish
air
i
were
wrong
an
i
beg
your
pardon
that
woman
ain
t
no
i
the
case
she
s
a
the
words
were
laden
with
disgust
and
indignation
uncle
naboth
drew
out
his
gorgeous
handkerchief
and
wiped
his
face
with
it
then
he
dropped
upon
the
bench
and
pushed
his
big
hands
deep
into
his
capacious
pockets
with
the
air
of
a
man
crushed
and
defeated
i
sighed
then
she
refused
to
give
up
the
property
give
up
she
d
die
first
why
sam
the
critter
tried
to
brain
me
with
a
gridiron
almost
my
boy
you
was
an
orphan
agin
he
who
fights
an
runs
away
may
n
t
get
much
credit
for
it
but
he
s
a
durned
sight
safer
ner
a
dead
man
the
perkinses
was
allus
a
reckless
crew
but
sooner
n
face
that
female
agin
i
d
tackle
a
mad
bull
won
t
the
law
help
us
i
asked
the
law
cried
perkins
in
a
voice
of
intense
horror
w
y
sam
the
law
s
more
to
be
dreaded
than
a
woman
it
s
an
invention
of
the
devil
to
keep
poor
mortals
from
becomin
too
happy
in
this
ere
vale
o
tears
my
boy
if
ye
ever
has
to
choose
between
the
law
an
a
woman
my
advice
is
to
commit
suicide
at
once
it
s
quicker
an
less
but
the
law
stands
for
justice
i
protested
that
s
the
bluff
it
puts
up
said
uncle
naboth
but
it
ain
t
so
an
where
s
your
proof
agin
ranck
anyhow
cap
n
steele
foolishly
put
the
house
in
her
name
if
she
ain
t
honest
enough
to
give
it
up
no
one
can
take
it
from
her
an
he
kep
secret
about
the
fortune
that
was
left
in
his
room
so
we
can
t
describe
the
things
you
ve
been
robbed
of
altogether
it
s
jest
a
hopeless
case
the
has
made
up
her
mind
to
inherit
your
fortune
an
you
can
t
help
as
i
stared
into
the
little
man
s
face
the
tears
came
into
my
eyes
and
blurred
my
sight
he
thrust
the
red
handkerchief
into
my
hand
and
i
quickly
wiped
away
the
traces
of
unmanly
weakness
and
when
i
could
see
plainly
again
my
uncle
was
deeply
involved
in
one
of
his
fits
of
silent
merriment
and
his
shoulders
were
shaking
spasmodically
i
waited
for
him
to
cough
and
choke
which
he
proceeded
to
do
before
regaining
his
gravity
the
attack
seemed
to
have
done
him
good
for
he
smiled
at
my
disturbed
expression
and
laid
a
kindly
hand
on
my
shoulder
run
up
to
the
house
my
lad
an
get
your
bundle
of
clothes
he
said
i
ll
be
here
when
you
get
back
don
t
worry
over
what
s
gone
i
ll
take
care
o
you
i
gave
him
a
grateful
glance
and
clasped
his
big
horny
hands
in
both
my
own
thank
you
uncle
said
i
i
don
t
know
what
would
have
become
of
me
if
you
had
not
turned
up
just
as
you
lucky
wasn
t
it
sam
but
run
along
and
get
your
i
obeyed
walking
slowly
and
thoughtfully
back
to
the
house
when
i
tried
to
raise
the
latch
i
found
the
door
locked
mrs
ranck
i
called
mrs
ranck
let
me
in
please
i
ve
come
for
my
there
was
no
answer
i
rattled
the
latch
but
all
in
vain
so
i
sat
down
upon
the
steps
of
the
porch
wondering
what
i
should
do
it
was
a
strange
and
unpleasant
sensation
to
find
myself
suddenly
barred
from
the
home
in
which
i
had
been
born
and
wherein
i
had
lived
all
my
boyhood
days
it
was
only
my
indignation
against
this
selfish
and
hard
old
woman
that
prevented
me
from
bursting
into
another
flood
of
tears
for
my
nerves
were
all
unstrung
by
the
events
of
the
past
few
hours
however
anger
held
all
other
passion
in
check
for
the
moment
and
i
was
about
to
force
an
entrance
through
the
side
window
as
i
had
done
on
several
occasions
before
when
the
sash
of
the
window
in
my
own
attic
room
was
pushed
up
and
a
bundle
was
projected
from
it
with
such
good
aim
that
it
would
have
struck
my
head
had
i
not
instinctively
dodged
it
ranck
s
head
followed
the
bundle
far
enough
to
cast
a
cruel
and
triumphant
glance
into
my
upturned
face
there
s
your
duds
take
em
an
go
you
ongrateful
wretch
she
yelled
an
don
t
ye
let
me
see
your
face
again
until
you
come
to
pay
me
the
money
you
owes
for
your
keepin
please
ranck
i
asked
meekly
can
i
have
my
father
s
watch
and
ring
no
no
no
she
screamed
in
a
fury
do
ye
want
to
rob
me
of
everything
ain
t
you
satisfied
to
owe
me
four
hundred
dollars
a
ready
d
like
some
keepsake
of
father
s
i
persisted
well
knowing
this
would
be
my
last
chance
to
procure
it
you
may
keep
the
watch
if
you
ll
give
me
the
i
ll
keep
m
both
she
retorted
you
ll
get
nothin
more
out
n
me
now
or
never
then
she
slammed
down
the
window
and
refused
to
answer
by
a
word
my
further
pleadings
so
finally
i
picked
up
the
bundle
and
feeling
miserable
and
sick
at
heart
followed
the
path
back
to
the
little
grove
it
didn
t
take
you
very
long
but
that
s
all
the
better
said
my
uncle
shutting
his
with
a
click
and
then
standing
up
to
brush
the
chips
from
his
lap
we
two
ll
go
to
the
tavern
an
talk
over
our
future
silently
i
walked
by
the
side
of
naboth
perkins
until
we
came
to
the
village
i
knew
everyone
in
the
little
town
and
several
of
the
fishermen
and
sailors
met
me
with
words
of
honest
sympathy
for
my
loss
captain
steele
had
been
the
big
man
of
batteraft
beloved
by
all
who
knew
him
despite
his
reserved
nature
and
these
simple
villagers
rude
and
uneducated
but
kindly
hearted
felt
that
in
his
death
they
had
lost
a
good
friend
and
a
neighbor
of
whom
they
had
always
been
proud
not
one
of
them
would
have
refused
assistance
to
captain
steele
s
only
son
but
they
were
all
very
poor
and
it
was
lucky
for
me
that
uncle
naboth
had
arrived
so
opportunely
to
befriend
me
having
ordered
a
substantial
dinner
of
the
landlord
of
the
rudder
perkins
gravely
invited
me
to
his
private
room
for
a
conference
and
i
climbed
the
rickety
stairs
in
his
wake
the
chamber
was
very
luxurious
in
my
eyes
with
its
rag
carpet
and
bed
its
and
i
could
not
easily
withhold
my
deference
to
the
man
who
was
able
to
hire
it
and
removing
my
cap
i
sat
upon
the
edge
of
the
bed
while
uncle
naboth
took
possession
of
the
and
lighted
a
big
briar
pipe
having
settled
himself
comfortably
by
putting
his
feet
upon
the
sill
of
the
open
window
he
remarked
now
sam
my
lad
we
ll
talk
it
all
very
well
sir
i
replied
much
impressed
in
the
first
place
i
m
your
father
s
partner
as
i
said
afore
some
years
ago
the
cap
n
found
he
had
more
money
n
he
could
use
in
his
own
business
an
i
d
saved
up
a
bit
myself
to
match
it
so
we
put
both
together
an
bought
a
schooner
called
the
flipper
w
ich
i
m
free
to
say
is
the
best
boat
fer
its
size
an
kind
that
ever
sailed
the
the
pacific
naterally
cap
n
steele
on
the
atlantic
an
cap
n
perkins
on
the
pacific
in
that
way
we
divided
up
the
world
between
he
stopped
to
wink
here
and
began
his
silent
chuckle
but
fortunately
he
remembered
the
importance
of
the
occasion
and
refrained
from
carrying
it
to
the
choking
stage
i
s
pose
your
father
never
said
naught
to
you
about
this
deal
o
ours
any
more
n
he
did
to
that
up
at
the
house
an
it
s
lucky
he
didn
t
or
the
critter
d
be
claimin
the
flipper
too
an
then
you
an
i
d
be
out
of
a
job
he
winked
again
solemnly
this
time
and
i
sat
still
and
stared
at
him
howsomever
the
flipper
is
still
in
statute
loo
an
thank
heaven
fer
that
i
made
sev
ral
voyages
in
her
to
australy
that
turned
out
fairly
profitably
an
brought
the
cap
n
an
me
some
good
bits
o
money
so
last
year
we
thought
we
d
tackle
the
japan
trade
that
seemed
to
be
lookin
up
it
looked
down
agin
as
soon
as
i
struck
the
pesky
shores
an
a
month
ago
i
returned
to
frisco
a
sadder
an
a
wiser
man
not
that
the
losses
was
so
great
sam
you
understand
but
the
earnin
s
wasn
t
enough
to
buy
a
so
i
sailed
to
batteraft
to
consult
with
my
partner
which
is
cap
n
steele
as
to
our
next
voyage
an
the
rest
o
the
story
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
your
father
bein
out
o
the
firm
from
no
fault
o
his
n
his
son
is
his
nateral
successor
so
i
take
it
that
hereafter
we
ll
have
to
consult
my
amazed
expression
amused
him
exceedingly
but
i
found
it
impossible
just
then
to
utter
a
single
word
uncle
naboth
did
not
seem
to
expect
me
to
speak
for
after
lighting
his
pipe
again
he
continued
with
an
air
of
great
complacency
it
mought
be
said
that
as
you
re
a
minor
i
stands
as
your
rightful
guardeen
an
have
a
right
to
act
for
you
til
you
come
of
age
on
the
other
hand
you
mought
claim
that
bein
a
partner
your
size
an
age
don
t
count
an
you
ve
a
right
to
be
heard
howsomever
we
won
t
go
to
law
about
it
sam
the
law
s
onreliable
sometimes
it
s
right
an
mostly
it
s
wrong
but
it
ain
t
never
to
be
trusted
by
an
honest
man
if
you
insist
on
dictatin
what
this
partnership
s
goin
to
do
you
ll
probably
run
it
on
a
rock
in
two
jerks
of
a
lamb
s
tail
for
you
haven
t
got
the
experience
old
cap
n
steele
had
but
if
you
re
satisfied
to
let
me
take
the
tiller
an
steer
you
into
harbor
why
i
ll
accept
the
job
an
do
the
best
i
can
at
uncle
naboth
i
replied
earnestly
had
you
not
been
an
honest
man
i
would
never
have
known
you
were
my
father
s
partner
or
that
he
had
any
interest
in
your
business
but
you
ve
been
more
than
honest
you
ve
been
kind
to
me
and
i
am
only
too
glad
to
trust
you
in
every
well
spoke
lad
cried
perkins
slapping
his
knee
delightedly
it
s
what
i
had
a
right
to
expect
in
poor
mary
s
boy
we
re
sure
to
get
along
sam
and
even
if
i
don
t
make
you
rich
you
ll
never
need
a
stout
friend
while
your
uncle
nabe
is
alive
an
kickin
then
we
both
stood
up
and
shook
hands
with
great
solemnity
to
seal
the
bargain
after
which
my
friend
and
protector
returned
to
his
rocker
and
once
more
stretched
his
feet
across
the
window
sill
how
much
property
belongs
to
me
uncle
i
asked
we
never
drew
up
any
papers
cap
n
steele
knew
as
he
could
trust
me
an
so
papers
wa
n
t
necessary
he
owned
interest
in
the
flipper
an
supplied
one
half
the
money
to
carry
on
the
trade
that
made
it
mighty
hard
to
figure
out
the
profits
so
we
gen
ly
lumped
it
to
save
of
course
your
father
s
been
paid
all
his
earnin
s
after
each
voyage
was
over
so
accounts
is
settled
up
to
the
japan
trip
probably
the
money
i
gave
him
was
in
the
an
that
old
up
to
the
house
grabbed
it
with
the
other
things
the
japan
voyage
was
a
failure
as
i
told
you
but
there
s
about
a
thousand
dollars
still
comin
to
the
cap
means
it
s
comin
to
you
the
ship
s
worth
a
good
ten
thousand
i
tried
to
think
what
that
meant
to
me
it
isn
t
a
very
big
sum
of
money
is
it
uncle
i
asked
diffidently
that
depends
on
how
you
look
at
it
he
answered
big
oaks
from
little
acorns
grow
you
know
if
you
leave
the
matter
to
me
i
ll
try
to
make
that
thousand
sprout
considerable
before

of
of

i
ll
leave
it
to
you
said
i
and
i
am
very
grateful
for
your
kindness
don
t
you
turn
your
gratitude
loose
too
soon
sam
i
may
land
your
fortunes
high
an
dry
on
the
rocks
afore
i
ve
got
through
with
em
but
if
i
do
it
won
t
be
on
purpose
an
we
ll
sink
or
swim
together
an
now
that
bein
as
good
as
settled
the
next
thing
to
argy
is
what
you
re
to
do
while
i
m
sailin
the
seas
an
makin
money
for
what
would
you
suggest
i
asked
well
some
folks
might
think
you
ought
to
have
more
schoolin

you
sixteen

you
read
an
write
an
do
figgers
oh
yes
i
ve
finished
the
public
school

i
replied
smiling
at
the
simple
question
then
i
guess
you
ve
had
study
enough
my
lad
and
are
ready
to
go
to
work
i
never
had
much
schoolin
myself
but
i
ve
managed
to
hold
my
own
in
the
world
in
spite
of
the
way
letters
an
figgers
mix
up
when
i
look
at
em
not
but
what
eddication
is
a
good
thing
but
all
eddication
don
t
lay
in
schools
rubbin
against
the
world
is
what
polishes
up
a
man
an
the
feller
that
keeps
his
eyes
open
can
learn
somethin
new
every
day
to
be
open
with
you
sam
i
need
you
pretty
bad
on
the
flipper
to
keep
the
books
an
look
after
the
accounts
an
do
writin
an
spellin
when
letters
has
to
be
writ
on
the
last
trip
i
put
in
four
days
hard
work
writin
a
letter
that
was
only
three
lines
long
an
i
m
blamed
if
the
landsman
i
sent
it
to
didn
t
telegraph
me
for
a
translation
so
if
you
re
willin
to
ship
with
the
firm
of
perkins
steele
i
ll
make
you
purser
an
chief
i
should
like
that
i
answered
eagerly
then
the
second
p
int
s
settled
there
s
only
one
more
the
flipper
is
lyin
in
the
harbor
at
frisco
when
shall
we
join
her
lad
i
m
ready
now
good
i
ve
ordered
a
wagon
to
carry
us
over
to
the
railroad
station
at
four
o
clock
so
ye
see
i
had
a
pretty
good
idea
beforehand
what
sort
o
stuff
mary
s
boy
was
made
of
now
let
s
go
to
chapter
iv
i
ship
aboard
the
when
the
spring
wagon
drew
up
before
the
tavern
door
quite
a
crowd
of
idle
villagers
assembled
to
see
us
off
and
among
them
i
noticed
my
father
s
old
sailor
ned
britton
uncle
naboth
climbed
aboard
at
once
but
i
stayed
to
shake
the
hands
held
out
to
me
and
to
thank
the
batteraft
people
for
their
hearty
wishes
for
my
future
prosperity
i
think
they
were
sorry
to
see
me
go
and
i
know
i
felt
a
sudden
pang
of
regret
at
parting
from
the
place
where
i
had
lived
so
long
and
the
simple
villagers
who
had
been
my
friends
when
at
last
i
mounted
to
the
rear
seat
of
the
wagon
and
sat
beside
my
uncle
i
was
astonished
to
find
ned
britton
established
beside
the
driver
are
you
going
with
us
i
asked
the
sailor
nodded
it
s
like
this
remarked
perkins
as
we
rolled
away
from
the
tavern
this
man
belonged
to
my
old
partner
cap
n
steele
an
stuck
to
his
ship
til
she
went
down
also
he
s
put
himself
out
to
come
here
an
tell
us
the
news
and
it
ain
t
every
sailor
as
ll
take
the
trouble
to
do
such
a
job
therefore
ned
britton
bein
at
present
without
a
ship
i
ve
asked
him
to
take
a
berth
aboard
the
that
was
kind
of
you
uncle
i
said
pleased
at
this
evidence
of
my
relative
s
kindly
nature
an
honest
sailor
ain
t
to
be
sneezed
at
continued
uncle
naboth
with
one
of
his
quaint
winks
if
ned
britton
were
faithful
to
the
saracen
he
ll
be
faithful
to
the
an
that
s
the
sort
o
man
we
britton
doubtless
overheard
every
word
of
this
eulogy
but
he
gazed
stolidly
ahead
and
paid
no
attention
to
my
uncle
s
words
of
praise
we
reached
the
railway
station
in
ample
time
for
the
train
and
soon
were
whirling
away
on
our
long
journey
into
the
golden
west
no
incident
worthy
of
note
occurred
on
our
way
across
the
continent
although
i
might
record
a
bit
of
diplomacy
on
the
part
of
uncle
naboth
that
illustrates
the
peculiar
shrewdness
i
have
always
found
coupled
with
his
native
simplicity
just
before
our
train
drew
into
chicago
where
we
were
to
change
cars
and
spend
the
best
part
of
a
day
my
uncle
slipped
into
my
hand
a
long
fat
saying
hide
that
in
your
pocket
sam
and
button
it
up
what
s
your
idea
uncle
nabe
i
asked
why
we
re
comin
to
the
wickedest
city
in
all
the
world
accordin
to
the
preachers
an
if
it
ain
t
that
it
s
bad
enough
in
all
conscience
there
s
robbers
an
men
by
the
thousands
an
if
one
of
em
got
hold
of
me
i
d
be
busted
in
half
a
second
but
none
of
em
would
think
of
holdin
up
a
boy
like
you
so
the
money
s
safe
in
your
pocket
if
you
don
t
go
an
lose
i
ll
try
not
to
do
that
sir
i
returned
but
all
during
the
day
the
possession
of
the
big
made
me
nervous
and
uneasy
i
constantly
felt
of
my
breast
to
see
that
the
money
was
still
safe
and
it
is
a
wonder
my
actions
did
not
betray
to
some
sly
thief
the
fact
that
i
was
concealing
the
combined
wealth
of
our
little
party
no
attempt
was
made
to
rob
us
however
either
at
chicago
or
during
the
remainder
of
the
journey
to
the
pacific
coast
and
we
arrived
at
our
destination
safely
and
in
good
spirits
uncle
naboth
seemed
especially
pleased
to
reach
san
francisco
again
this
car
travellin
he
said
is
good
enough
for
landsmen
that
don
t
know
of
anything
better
but
i
d
rather
spend
a
month
at
sea
than
a
night
in
one
of
them
stuffy
dangerous
cars
that
are
likely
to
run
off
n
the
track
any
ned
britton
and
i
accompanied
perkins
to
a
modest
but
respectable
near
the
bay
where
we
secured
rooms
and
partook
of
a
hearty
breakfast
then
we
took
a
long
walk
and
i
got
my
first
sight
of
the
famous
golden
i
was
surprised
at
the
great
quantity
of
shipping
in
the
bay
and
as
i
looked
over
the
hundreds
of
craft
at
anchor
i
wondered
curiously
which
was
the
flipper
of
which
i
was
part
gallant
ship
whose
praises
uncle
naboth
had
sung
so
persistently
ever
since
we
left
batteraft
after
luncheon
we
hired
a
small
boat
and
ned
britton
undertook
to
row
us
aboard
the
flipper
which
had
been
hidden
from
our
view
by
a
point
of
land
i
own
that
after
my
uncle
s
glowing
descriptions
of
her
i
expected
to
see
a
most
beautiful
schooner
with
lines
even
nobler
than
those
of
the
grand
old
saracen
which
had
been
my
father
s
pride
for
so
many
years
so
my
disappointment
may
be
imagined
when
we
drew
up
to
a
grimy
looking
vessel
of
some
six
hundred
tons
with
discolored
sails
rigging
and
a
glaring
need
of
fresh
paint
ned
britton
however
rested
on
his
oars
studied
the
ship
carefully
and
then
slowly
nodded
his
head
in
approval
well
what
d
ye
think
o
her
asked
uncle
naboth
relapsing
into
one
of
his
silent
chuckles
at
the
expression
of
my
face
she
looks
rather
dirty
sir
i
answered
honestly
the
flipper
ain
t
quite
as
fresh
as
a
lily
in
bloom
that
s
a
fact
returned
my
uncle
in
no
ways
discomfited
by
my
remark
she
wasn
t
no
deebutantee
when
i
bought
her
an
her
clothes
has
got
old
and
darned
and
patched
bein
as
we
haven
t
been
near
to
a
paris
dressmaker
but
i
ve
sailed
in
her
these
ten
years
past
sam
an
we
re
both
as
sound
as
a
she
ought
to
be
fast
sir
remarked
britton
critically
perkins
aloud
but
in
his
silent
distinctly
humorous
way
she
fast
my
lad
w
ich
is
a
virtue
in
a
ship
if
it
ain
t
in
a
woman
and
in
some
other
ways
besides
the
flipper
ain
t
to
be
sneezed
at
as
for
her
age
she
s
too
shy
to
tell
it
but
i
guess
it
entitles
her
to
full
we
now
drew
alongside
and
climbed
upon
the
deck
where
my
uncle
was
greeted
by
a
tall
lank
man
who
appeared
to
my
curious
eyes
to
be
a
good
example
of
a
living
skeleton
his
clothes
covered
his
bones
like
bags
and
so
thin
and
drawn
was
his
face
that
his
expression
was
one
of
constant
pain
morn
n
cap
n
said
uncle
naboth
although
it
was
afternoon
morn
n
perkins
returned
the
other
in
a
sad
voice
glad
to
see
you
here
s
my
nevvy
sam
steele
whose
father
were
part
owner
but
got
lost
in
a
storm
awhile
glad
to
see
you
sir
said
the
captain
giving
my
hand
a
melancholy
shake
an
here
s
ned
britton
who
once
sailed
with
cap
n
steele
continued
my
uncle
he
ll
sign
with
us
cap
n
gay
and
i
guess
you
ll
find
him
a
no
glad
to
see
you
britton
repeated
the
captain
in
his
dismal
voice
if
the
lanky
captain
was
as
glad
to
see
us
all
as
his
words
indicated
his
expression
fully
contradicted
the
fact
britton
saluted
and
walked
aft
where
i
noticed
several
sailors
squatting
upon
the
deck
in
careless
attitudes
to
my
glance
these
seemed
as
solemn
and
joyless
as
their
captain
but
i
acknowledge
that
on
this
first
visit
everything
about
the
ship
was
a
disappointment
to
me
perhaps
because
i
had
had
little
experience
with
trading
vessels
and
my
mind
was
stored
with
recollections
of
the
trim
below
however
was
a
comfortable
cabin
well
fitted
up
and
uncle
naboth
showed
me
a
berth
next
to
his
own
private
room
which
was
to
be
my
future
home
the
place
was
little
more
than
a
closet
but
i
decided
it
would
do
very
well
i
thought
were
the
captain
of
the
flipper
uncle
naboth
said
i
when
we
were
alone
no
i
m
jest
he
replied
with
his
usual
wink
you
see
i
wasn
t
eddicated
as
a
sailor
sam
an
never
cared
to
learn
the
trade
cap
n
gay
is
one
o
the
best
seamen
that
ever
laid
a
course
so
i
hire
him
to
take
the
ship
wherever
i
want
to
go
as
fer
the
cargo
that
s
my
special
an
it
keeps
me
busy
enough
i
can
tell
you
i
m
a
nat
ral
born
trader
and
except
fer
that
blamed
japan
trip
i
ain
t
much
ashamed
of
my
will
you
go
to
australia
again
i
asked
not
jest
now
sam
my
next
venture
s
goin
to
be
a
bit
you
might
call
speculative
an
but
we
ll
talk
that
over
tonight
after
after
making
a
cursory
examination
of
the
ship
uncle
naboth
received
the
captain
s
report
of
what
had
transpired
in
his
absence
and
then
we
rowed
back
to
town
again
we
strolled
through
the
city
streets
for
an
hour
had
supper
and
then
my
uncle
took
me
to
his
room
carefully
closed
and
locked
the
door
and
announced
that
he
was
ready
to
talk
bein
partners
he
said
we
ve
got
to
consult
together
but
i
take
it
you
won
t
feel
bad
sam
if
i
do
most
of
the
consultin
i
went
down
east
to
batteraft
to
talk
my
plans
with
your
father
but
he
slipped
his
cable
an
i
ve
got
to
talk
em
to
you
if
you
see
i
m
wrong
anywhere
jest
chip
in
an
stop
me
but
otherwise
the
less
you
say
the
more
good
we
ll
get
out
n
this
ere
very
well
to
start
in
with
we
ve
got
a
ship
an
a
crew
an
plenty
o
loose
money
so
what
ll
we
do
with
em
our
business
is
to
trade
an
to
invest
our
money
so
we
ll
make
more
with
it
what
s
the
best
way
to
do
that
he
seemed
to
pause
for
an
answer
so
i
said
i
don
t
know
nobody
of
course
but
we
can
guess
and
then
find
out
afterward
if
we
ve
guessed
right
all
business
is
a
gamble
and
if
it
wasn
t
most
men
would
quit
an
go
fishin
after
i
got
back
from
japan
i
met
a
lot
o
fellows
that
had
been
to
alaska
huntin
gold
seems
like
alaska
s
full
of
gold
an
before
long
the
whole
country
ll
be
flockin
there
like
sheep
all
frisco
s
gettin
excited
about
the
thing
so
they
tell
me
and
if
fortunes
is
goin
to
be
made
in
alaska
we
may
as
well
speak
for
one
but
we
are
not
miners
uncle
and
it
s
bitter
cold
up
there
they
well
put
we
ll
let
the
crowds
mine
the
gold
and
then
hand
it
over
to
i
m
afraid
i
don
t
understand
said
i
weakly
no
call
for
you
to
try
sam
i
m
your
guardeen
an
so
i
ll
do
the
understandin
for
us
both
folks
has
to
eat
my
lad
an
gold
hunters
is
usually
too
excited
to
make
proper
provisions
fer
their
stomachs
they
re
goin
to
be
mighty
hungry
out
in
alaska
before
long
an
when
a
man
s
hungry
he
ll
pay
liberal
fer
a
square
meal
let
s
give
it
to
him
sam
an
take
the
is
gold
dust
an
how
will
you
do
it
uncle
nabe
load
the
flipper
with
grub
an
carry
it
to
kipnac
or
up
the
yukon
as
far
as
fort
weare
or
wherever
the
gold
fields
open
up
then
when
the
miners
get
hungry
they
ll
come
to
us
and
trade
their
gold
for
our
groceries
we
re
sure
to
make
big
profits
it
looks
like
a
reasonable
proposition
sir
i
said
but
it
seems
to
me
rather
dangerous
suppose
our
ship
gets
frozen
in
the
ice
and
we
can
t
get
away
and
suppose
about
that
time
we
ve
sold
out
our
provisions
we
can
t
eat
gold
and
s
pose
the
moon
falls
out
n
the
sky
interrupted
uncle
naboth
wouldn
t
it
be
dark
at
night
though
well
sir
if
the
can
live
in
the
ice
fields
we
can
live
in
a
good
warm
ship
and
we
ll
keep
enough
grub
for
ourselves
you
may
be
sure
of
when
do
we
start
i
asked
feeling
sure
that
no
arguments
would
move
my
uncle
to
abandon
the
trip
once
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
undertake
it
as
soon
as
we
can
get
the
cargo
aboard
it
s
coming
on
warmer
weather
now
and
this
is
the
best
time
to
make
the
voyage
a
steamer
left
today
with
three
hundred
prospectors
an
they
ll
be
goin
in
bunches
every
day
now
already
i
estimate
there
s
over
a
thousand
in
the
fields
so
we
won
t
get
there
any
too
soon
to
do
business
what
do
you
say
sam
i
ve
nothing
to
say
sir
being
my
guardian
you
ve
decided
the
matter
for
both
the
partners
as
is
right
and
proper
as
your
clerk
and
assistant
i
ll
obey
whatever
orders
you
give
that
s
the
proper
spirit
lad
he
cried
with
enthusiasm
we
ll
go
to
work
tomorrow
morning
and
if
all
goes
well
we
ll
be
afloat
in
ten
days
with
a
full
cargo
chapter
nux
and
on
the
seventh
day
of
may
the
flipper
weighed
anchor
and
sailed
before
a
light
breeze
through
the
golden
gate
and
away
on
her
voyage
toward
alaska
and
its
gold
fields
stored
within
her
hold
was
a
vast
quantity
of
provisions
of
the
sort
that
could
be
kept
indefinitely
without
danger
of
spoiling
flour
hams
bacon
sugar
and
coffee
were
represented
but
canned
meats
and
vegetables
tobacco
and
cheap
cigars
comprised
by
far
the
greater
part
of
the
cargo
uncle
naboth
had
been
seriously
advised
to
carry
a
good
supply
of
liquors
but
refused
positively
to
traffic
in
such
merchandise
indeed
my
uncle
rose
many
degrees
in
my
respect
after
i
had
watched
for
a
time
his
preparations
for
our
voyage
simple
rough
and
uneducated
he
might
be
but
a
shrewder
man
at
a
bargain
i
have
never
met
in
all
my
experience
and
his
reputation
for
honesty
was
so
well
established
that
his
credit
was
practically
unlimited
among
the
wholesale
grocers
and
notion
jobbers
of
san
francisco
everyone
seemed
ready
and
anxious
to
assist
him
and
the
amount
of
consideration
he
met
with
on
every
hand
was
really
wonderful
we
ve
bought
the
right
stuff
sam
he
said
to
me
as
we
stood
on
the
deck
and
watched
the
shore
gradually
recede
and
now
we
ve
got
to
sell
it
right
that
s
the
secret
of
good
tradin
i
was
glad
enough
to
find
myself
at
sea
where
i
could
rest
from
my
labors
of
the
past
two
weeks
i
had
been
upon
the
docks
night
and
day
it
seemed
checking
off
packages
of
goods
as
fast
as
they
were
loaded
on
the
lighters
and
being
unaccustomed
to
work
i
tired
very
easily
but
my
books
were
all
accurate
and
and
i
had
found
opportunity
to
fit
up
my
little
with
many
comforts
in
this
i
had
been
aided
by
uncle
naboth
who
was
exceedingly
liberal
in
allowing
me
money
for
whatever
i
required
at
one
time
i
said
i
would
like
to
buy
a
few
books
and
the
next
day
to
my
surprise
he
sent
to
my
room
a
box
containing
the
complete
works
of
walter
scott
and
robert
louis
stevenson
with
a
miscellaneous
collection
of
volumes
by
standard
authors
i
don
t
know
much
about
books
myself
sam
he
said
so
i
got
a
feller
that
know
to
pick
em
out
for
me
an
i
guess
you
ll
find
em
the
right
i
did
not
tell
him
that
i
would
have
preferred
to
make
my
own
selection
and
afterward
i
frankly
admitted
to
myself
that
the
collection
was
an
admirable
one
by
this
time
i
had
come
to
know
all
the
officers
and
crew
and
found
them
a
pretty
good
lot
taken
altogether
the
principle
characters
aboard
were
the
dismal
captain
gay
who
was
really
as
contented
a
man
as
i
ever
knew
acker
the
ship
s
doctor
and
two
queer
black
men
called
by
everybody
nux
and
bryonia
acker
was
a
big
burly
englishman
who
besides
being
doctor
served
as
mate
he
was
jolly
and
good
natured
as
the
day
was
long
and
had
a
few
good
stories
which
he
told
over
and
over
again
invariably
laughing
at
them
more
heartily
than
his
auditors
did
singularly
enough
captain
gay
and
doc
acker
were
close
friends
and
cronies
and
lived
together
in
perfect
harmony
the
black
men
interested
me
greatly
from
the
moment
i
first
saw
them
bryonia
or
bry
as
he
was
more
frequently
called
was
the
cook
and
gave
perfect
satisfaction
in
that
capacity
nux
was
serving
the
cabin
mess
assisting
the
cook
and
acting
as
able
seaman
whenever
required
he
proved
competent
in
nearly
all
ways
and
was
a
prime
favorite
with
officers
and
men
they
were
natives
of
some
small
island
of
the
sulu
archipelago
and
their
history
was
a
strange
one
in
answer
to
my
question
as
to
why
the
blacks
were
so
queerly
named
uncle
naboth
related
the
following
it
were
six
years
ago
or
thereabout
as
we
were
homeward
bound
from
our
third
australy
trip
that
we
sighted
a
native
canoe
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
caroline
islands
it
was
early
in
the
mornin
and
at
first
the
lookout
thought
the
canoe
was
empty
but
it
happened
to
lay
in
our
course
and
as
we
overtook
it
we
saw
two
niggers
lyin
bound
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
so
we
lay
to
an
picked
em
up
an
when
they
was
histed
aboard
they
were
considerable
more
dead
ner
alive
bill
acker
was
our
mate
then
as
he
is
now
an
in
his
early
days
he
studied
to
be
a
hoss
doctor
so
he
always
carries
a
box
of
medicines
with
him
to
fix
up
the
men
in
case
they
gets
the
jaundice
or
the
colic
mostly
they
s
pills
an
sugar
coated
for
doc
hates
to
tackle
drugs
as
is
very
dangerous
an
on
account
of
a
good
deal
of
sickness
among
the
crew
that
trip
an
consequently
a
good
deal
of
experimentin
by
doc
on
the
medicine
chest
the
pills
an
such
like
was
nearly
used
up
though
no
one
seemed
much
the
worse
for
it
well
after
we
d
cut
the
niggers
bonds
an
rubbed
em
good
to
restore
the
circulation
we
come
near
decidin
they
was
dead
an
heavin
of
em
overboard
agin
but
doc
wouldn
t
give
up
he
brought
out
the
medicine
box
an
found
that
all
the
stuff
he
had
left
was
two
bottles
of
pills
one
of
em
nux
vomica
an
the
other
bryonia
i
was
workin
over
one
of
the
niggers
an
doc
he
hands
me
one
o
the
bottles
an
says
so
i
emptied
the
bottle
into
the
dead
man
s
mouth
an
by
jinks
sam
he
come
around
all
right
and
is
alive
an
kickin
today
cap
n
gay
dosed
the
other
one
with
the
bryonia
an
it
fetched
him
in
no
time
i
won
t
swear
it
were
the
pills
you
know
but
the
fact
is
the
niggers
lived
afterwards
we
found
the
critters
couldn
t
speak
a
word
of
english
ner
tell
us
even
what
their
names
were
so
we
called
one
nux
and
the
other
bryonia
accordin
to
the
medicine
that
had
saved
their
lives
an
they
ve
answered
to
those
names
ever
the
blacks
were
gentle
and
good
natured
and
being
grateful
for
their
rescue
they
had
refused
to
leave
the
ship
at
the
end
of
the
voyage
and
were
now
permanent
fixtures
of
the
they
are
not
slaves
are
they
i
asked
when
i
had
listened
to
this
story
mercy
no
exclaimed
uncle
naboth
they
re
as
free
as
any
of
us
an
draw
their
wages
reg
lar
also
they
re
as
faithful
as
the
day
is
long
an
never
get
drunk
or
mutinous
so
it
were
a
lucky
day
when
we
picked
em
bryonia
stood
fully
six
feet
in
height
and
was
muscular
and
wonderfully
strong
he
had
a
fine
face
too
and
large
and
intelligent
eyes
nux
was
much
shorter
and
inclined
to
be
fat
but
he
was
not
a
bit
lazy
for
all
that
and
accomplished
an
immense
amount
of
work
in
so
cheerful
a
manner
that
never
a
complaint
was
laid
at
his
door
not
a
sailor
could
climb
aloft
with
more
agility
or
a
surer
foot
and
both
nux
and
bryonia
were
absolutely
fearless
in
the
face
of
danger
although
these
men
were
black
they
were
not
negroes
but
belonged
to
a
branch
of
the
malay
race
their
hair
was
straight
their
noses
well
formed
and
their
eyes
very
expressive
and
intelligent
the
english
they
had
picked
up
from
the
crew
however
was
spoken
with
an
accent
not
unlike
that
peculiar
to
the
african
negroes
but
with
a
softer
and
more
sibilant
tone
before
i
had
been
on
the
ship
a
week
both
nux
and
bry
were
my
faithful
friends
and
devoted
followers
and
in
the
days
that
were
to
come
their
friendship
and
faithfulness
stood
me
in
good
stead
a
very
interesting
person
to
me
was
big
bill
acker
the
mate
called
by
courtesy
he
seemed
far
above
his
mates
in
the
matter
of
intelligence
and
was
evidently
a
well
bred
man
in
his
youth
a
shelf
above
his
bunk
bore
a
row
of
volumes
on
the
world
s
great
religions
together
with
a
talmud
a
koran
a
bible
the
works
of
confucius
and
max
müller
s
translation
of
the
vedas
one
seemed
to
have
been
as
thoroughly
read
as
the
others
yet
never
have
i
heard
doc
acker
say
one
word
good
or
bad
about
religion
whatever
the
result
of
his
studies
might
be
he
kept
his
opinions
strictly
to
himself
a
stiff
breeze
sprang
up
during
the
first
night
and
the
second
day
at
sea
found
me
miserably
ill
and
regretting
that
i
had
ever
trusted
myself
to
the
mercies
of
cruel
old
ocean
indeed
i
lay
in
a
most
pitiable
plight
until
the
big
englishman
came
to
me
with
doses
of
medicines
from
his
chest
he
might
have
been
merely
a
hoss
doctor
as
uncle
naboth
had
said
but
certain
it
is
that
his
remedies
helped
me
and
within
hours
i
was
again
able
to
walk
the
deck
in
comfort
perhaps
i
had
inherited
some
of
my
father
s
fondness
for
salt
water
for
my
new
life
soon
became
vastly
interesting
to
me
and
it
was
not
long
before
i
felt
entirely
at
home
on
the
dingy
old
one
morning
after
standing
by
the
bulwarks
for
a
time
watching
the
water
slip
by
i
climbed
upon
the
rail
and
sat
with
my
heels
dangling
over
the
side
suddenly
i
felt
a
strong
hand
grasp
my
shoulder
and
draw
me
to
the
deck
and
i
turned
around
indignantly
to
find
black
nux
beside
me
bad
place
to
sit
mars
sam
he
said
coolly
might
tum
le
ov
before
i
could
reply
uncle
naboth
who
had
witnessed
the
incident
strolled
up
to
us
and
said
nux
is
right
my
lad
you
never
find
a
sailor
sitting
on
the
rail
they
know
too
well
how
onreliable
the
motion
of
a
ship
is
if
anybody
drops
overboard
the
chances
o
bein
picked
up
alive
is
mighty
slim
i
tell
you
only
fools
put
emselves
into
unnecessary
danger
sam
take
it
on
them
orful
railroad
cars
for
instance
old
travellers
always
wait
till
the
train
stops
afore
they
gets
on
or
off
the
cars
them
as
don
t
know
the
danger
is
the
ones
that
gets
hurt
same
way
handlin
a
gun
an
old
hunter
once
told
me
he
never
p
inted
a
gun
at
anything
he
didn
t
want
to
kill
but
there
s
a
lot
o
folks
killed
ev
ry
year
that
don
t
know
the
blamed
thing
is
loaded
it
ain
t
cowardly
to
be
keerful
lad
but
only
fools
an
ignorant
people
is
reckless
enough
to
get
i
am
glad
to
say
i
took
this
lecture
with
good
humor
admitting
frankly
that
uncle
naboth
was
right
at
least
once
in
the
future
a
recollection
of
this
caution
saved
me
from
hopeless
disaster
on
the
sixth
day
the
breeze
died
away
and
the
ship
lay
still
there
was
not
a
breath
of
air
and
the
heat
was
so
intense
that
the
interior
of
the
ship
was
like
a
furnace
at
night
we
slept
upon
the
deck
and
by
day
we
lay
gasping
beneath
the
shade
of
the
tarpaulins
bryonia
let
the
galley
fire
die
out
and
served
us
cold
lunches
but
our
appetites
were
small
there
being
no
occasion
to
work
the
crew
gathered
in
little
bunches
and
told
a
series
of
yarns
that
were
very
interesting
to
me
because
most
of
them
were
of
adventures
and
escapes
that
were
positively
one
tried
to
believe
them
one
of
the
best
of
these
was
ned
britton
who
had
been
appointed
our
boatswain
and
was
already
popular
with
his
mates
as
his
yarns
were
all
of
the
atlantic
and
most
of
the
flipper
s
crew
had
sailed
only
on
the
pacific
britton
opened
to
them
a
new
field
of
adventures
which
met
with
universal
approval
nux
and
bry
who
bore
the
heat
better
than
their
white
brethren
added
to
the
general
amusement
by
giving
exhibitions
of
the
moro
war
dances
ending
with
desperate
encounters
with
sticks
to
represent
spears
that
were
sure
to
arouse
the
entire
crew
to
enthusiasm
they
sometimes
sang
their
native
war
songs
series
of
monotonous
guttural
chants
and
then
dan
donnegan
a
little
irishman
would
wind
up
with
bryan
o
lynne
or
some
other
comic
ditty
that
set
the
forecastle
roaring
with
laughter
during
this
period
of
enforced
idleness
the
dismal
captain
gay
walked
the
deck
with
solemn
patience
and
watched
for
signs
of
a
breeze
bill
acker
the
mate
read
his
religious
library
all
for
the
hundredth
time
uncle
nabe
taught
me
cribbage
and
we
played
for
hours
at
a
time
although
i
usually
came
out
second
best
at
the
game
also
i
learned
the
ropes
of
the
ship
and
received
many
lessons
in
navigation
from
my
friends
the
sailors
not
one
of
whom
knew
anything
about
that
abstruse
problem
thay
ain
t
a
man
o
the
lot
as
could
take
the
ship
back
to
frisco
in
case
of
emergency
said
my
uncle
and
i
believe
he
was
right
common
sailors
are
singularly
ignorant
of
navigation
although
they
have
a
way
of
deceiving
themselves
into
thinking
they
know
all
about
it
after
being
becalmed
six
days
the
intense
heat
was
at
last
relieved
by
a
thin
breeze
which
sprung
up
during
the
night
the
sails
were
at
once
trimmed
and
within
an
hour
the
flipper
was
skipping
the
little
waves
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
on
board
but
the
wind
steadily
increased
and
by
morning
all
hands
were
called
to
shorten
sail
by
noon
we
encountered
a
stiff
gale
which
blew
from
the
east
and
soon
lashed
the
waves
into
a
mad
frenzy
as
the
storm
gradually
increased
captain
gay
began
to
look
anxious
there
was
a
brief
lull
toward
evening
during
which
a
great
descended
upon
us
the
icy
bullets
pelting
the
sailors
unmercifully
and
driving
all
to
shelter
then
the
wind
redoubled
its
fury
and
the
captain
put
the
ship
before
it
allowing
the
gale
to
bear
us
considerably
out
of
our
course
uncle
naboth
growled
considerably
at
this
necessity
but
he
did
not
interfere
in
the
least
with
captain
gay
s
management
of
the
ship
safety
was
more
important
to
us
than
time
and
gay
was
not
a
man
to
take
unnecessary
chances
the
three
wild
days
that
followed
have
always
seemed
to
me
since
like
a
horrible
dream
i
had
no
idea
a
ship
could
be
so
tossed
and
pounded
and
battered
about
and
still
live
it
was
a
mere
chip
on
the
great
angry
ocean
and
the
water
washed
our
decks
almost
continually
after
one
of
these
deluges
when
every
man
strove
to
save
himself
by
clinging
to
the
life
lines
two
of
our
best
sailors
were
missed
and
we
never
saw
them
again
uncle
nabe
began
to
whistle
and
every
time
he
saw
me
he
gave
one
of
his
humorous
winks
or
fell
to
chuckling
in
his
silent
way
but
my
white
face
could
not
have
been
much
encouragement
to
gaiety
and
i
believe
he
was
not
over
merry
himself
but
merely
trying
to
cheer
me
up
but
although
the
danger
was
so
imminent
not
a
man
flinched
or
gave
way
to
fear
and
nux
and
bryonia
performed
their
duties
as
calmly
as
if
the
sea
were
smooth
the
vessel
was
staunch
enough
so
far
but
it
pitched
and
tossed
so
violently
that
even
burly
doc
acker
was
obliged
to
crawl
into
the
cabin
on
his
hands
and
knees
to
get
his
meals
we
fled
before
the
wind
until
the
third
night
when
the
rudder
chain
broke
and
the
helmsman
was
thrown
crushed
and
bleeding
against
the
lee
bulwarks
the
flipper
released
from
all
control
swung
quickly
around
and
the
big
mainmast
snapped
like
a
and
came
tumbling
with
its
cordage
to
the
decks
where
our
brave
sailors
rushed
upon
it
and
cut
it
clear
i
thought
the
ship
would
never
right
again
after
the
careening
given
it
by
the
fallen
mast
but
somehow
it
did
and
morning
found
us
still
afloat
although
badly
crippled
and
at
the
mercy
of
the
waves
as
if
satisfied
with
the
havoc
it
had
wrought
the
gale
now
abated
but
the
waves
ran
high
for
another
hours
and
our
crew
could
do
nothing
but
cling
to
the
remaining
rigging
and
await
calmer
weather
fortunately
our
ballast
and
cargo
held
in
place
through
all
and
the
hull
showed
no
sign
of
a
leak
when
the
sea
grew
calmer
we
floated
upright
upon
the
water
and
it
was
found
our
straits
were
not
nearly
so
desperate
as
we
had
feared
yet
our
condition
was
serious
enough
to
make
me
wonder
what
was
to
become
of
us
the
rudder
had
been
entirely
washed
away
the
mainmast
was
gone
the
mizzenmast
had
broken
at
the
head
and
the
foresail
royals
were
in
splinters
all
the
deck
was
cumbered
with
rigging
the
starboard
bulwarks
had
been
stove
in
by
the
fallen
mast
and
our
crew
was
lessened
by
three
able
seamen
but
captain
gay
no
less
dismal
than
before
you
may
be
sure
promptly
began
to
issue
orders
and
the
men
fell
to
with
a
will
to
repair
the
damage
as
best
they
might
first
they
rigged
up
a
temporary
rudder
and
swung
it
astern
it
was
a
poor
makeshift
however
and
only
with
good
weather
could
we
hope
it
would
steer
us
to
the
nearest
port
while
the
men
cleared
the
decks
and
rigged
up
a
jury
mast
under
the
supervision
of
the
mate
captain
gay
took
our
bearings
and
ascertained
that
we
had
not
departed
so
greatly
from
our
course
as
we
had
feared
yet
it
was
impossible
to
make
the
mouth
of
the
yukon
in
our
present
condition
or
even
to
reach
a
shelter
in
bering
sea
it
was
found
however
that
the
alaska
peninsula
was
not
far
away
so
we
decided
to
draw
as
near
to
that
as
possible
in
the
hope
of
meeting
a
passing
vessel
or
finding
a
temporary
refuge
on
some
one
of
the
numerous
islands
that
lie
in
this
part
of
the
north
pacific
for
four
days
we
labored
along
in
our
crippled
condition
without
sighting
land
but
then
our
fortunes
changed
during
the
night
a
good
breeze
from
the
southwest
swept
us
merrily
along
and
when
daylight
came
we
found
ourselves
close
to
a
small
wooded
island
it
lay
in
the
form
of
a
with
a
broad
protected
bay
in
the
center
and
captain
gay
anxious
to
examine
his
ship
more
closely
decided
at
once
to
enter
the
harbor
and
cast
anchor
this
was
by
no
means
an
easy
task
for
long
lines
of
reefs
extended
from
each
point
of
the
shore
almost
enclosing
the
bay
with
jagged
rocks
but
the
sea
was
calm
and
the
position
of
the
reefs
clearly
marked
so
that
by
skillful
maneuvering
the
flipper
passed
between
them
in
safety
and
to
the
relief
and
satisfaction
of
all
on
board
we
dropped
our
anchor
in
the
clear
waters
of
the
bay
chapter
vi
the
land
of
mystery
captain
gay
examined
his
chart
with
minute
care
and
solemnly
shook
his
head
the
island
was
not
there
either
the
chart
was
imperfect
or
we
had
reached
a
hitherto
undiscovered
land
the
latter
conjecture
was
not
at
all
unreasonable
for
so
many
islands
lay
in
this
neighborhood
that
even
when
sighted
by
chance
an
outlying
islet
was
little
liable
to
tempt
one
to
land
upon
it
this
was
doubtless
one
of
the
numerous
group
lying
to
the
of
the
alaska
peninsula
which
are
of
volcanic
origin
and
as
a
rule
barren
and
uninhabited
i
have
said
this
island
was
well
wooded
but
not
until
we
were
opposite
the
mouth
of
the
natural
harbor
did
we
observe
this
fact
from
the
sea
only
a
line
of
rugged
headlands
and
peaks
showed
plainly
and
had
we
not
been
in
distress
we
should
never
have
thought
to
stop
at
this
place
once
within
the
harbor
however
the
scene
that
met
our
view
was
not
unattractive
bordering
the
bay
was
a
sandy
beach
a
full
hundred
yards
in
width
broken
only
by
an
inlet
toward
the
left
or
south
which
seemed
to
lead
into
the
interior
of
the
island
winding
between
high
and
precipitous
banks
and
soon
becoming
lost
to
sight
back
of
the
beach
was
the
edge
of
a
forest
not
following
a
straight
line
but
rising
and
falling
in
hills
and
ravines
until
it
seemed
from
the
bay
to
have
been
scalloped
into
shape
by
a
pair
of
huge
scissors
the
woods
were
thick
and
the
trees
of
uniform
size
and
between
them
grew
a
mass
of
vines
and
underbrush
that
made
them
almost
impenetrable
how
far
the
forest
extended
we
were
unable
to
guess
nor
did
we
know
how
wide
the
island
might
be
for
back
of
the
hills
rose
a
range
of
wooded
mountains
nearly
a
thousand
feet
in
height
and
what
might
lie
beyond
these
was
of
course
a
matter
of
conjecture
uncle
naboth
however
advanced
the
opinion
that
the
island
ended
at
the
mountain
peaks
and
dropped
sheer
down
to
the
sea
beyond
he
had
seen
many
formations
of
that
sort
and
supposed
we
had
found
the
only
possible
harbor
on
the
island
there
was
no
apparent
indication
that
the
island
had
ever
before
been
visited
by
man
even
signs
of
native
occupation
were
lacking
but
captain
gay
decided
to
send
a
small
boat
ashore
to
explore
the
inlet
before
we
could
relax
all
vigilance
and
feel
that
we
were
not
liable
to
attack
or
interruption
so
the
gig
was
lowered
and
four
of
the
crew
accompanied
by
bill
acker
the
mate
set
off
upon
their
voyage
of
discovery
they
rowed
straight
to
the
inlet
which
proved
to
be
navigable
and
soon
after
entering
it
we
lost
sight
of
the
boat
as
it
wound
between
the
wooded
cliffs
we
waited
patiently
an
hour
two
hours
three
hours
but
the
boat
did
not
return
then
patience
gave
way
to
anxiety
and
finally
the
suspense
became
unbearable
after
the
loss
of
our
three
sailors
during
the
storm
we
were
reduced
to
eleven
men
besides
uncle
naboth
and
myself
who
were
not
counted
members
of
the
crew
thirteen
on
board
was
not
an
especially
lucky
number
so
that
some
of
the
men
had
been
looking
for
disaster
of
some
sort
ever
since
we
sighted
the
island
those
now
remaining
on
the
flipper
were
the
captain
ned
britton
and
two
other
sailors
nux
and
bryonia
my
uncle
and
myself
eight
all
told
to
send
more
men
after
the
five
who
were
absent
would
be
to
reduce
our
numbers
more
than
was
wise
yet
it
was
impossible
for
us
to
remain
inactive
finally
ned
britton
offered
to
attempt
to
make
his
way
through
the
woods
along
the
edge
of
the
inlet
and
endeavor
to
find
out
what
had
become
of
acker
and
his
men
he
armed
himself
with
two
revolvers
and
a
stout
cutlass
and
then
we
rowed
him
to
the
shore
and
watched
him
start
on
his
expedition
not
expecting
that
ned
would
be
long
absent
we
did
not
at
once
return
to
the
ship
instead
the
captain
backed
the
boat
into
deep
water
and
lay
to
that
we
might
pick
up
our
messenger
when
he
reappeared
it
had
been
agreed
that
if
ned
came
upon
the
mate
he
was
to
fire
two
shots
in
quick
succession
to
let
us
know
that
all
was
well
if
he
encountered
danger
he
was
to
fire
a
single
shot
if
he
wished
us
to
come
to
his
assistance
he
would
fire
three
shots
but
the
afternoon
passed
slowly
and
quietly
and
no
sound
of
any
kind
came
from
the
interior
to
relieve
our
anxiety
the
boat
returned
to
the
ship
and
bryonia
served
our
supper
amid
an
ominous
and
gloomy
silence
on
the
part
of
those
few
who
were
left
there
was
something
uncanny
about
this
mysterious
disappearance
of
our
comrades
had
they
been
able
to
return
or
to
communicate
with
us
there
was
no
doubt
they
would
have
done
so
therefore
their
absence
was
fraught
with
unknown
but
no
less
certain
terror
big
bill
acker
was
a
man
of
much
resource
and
absolutely
to
be
depended
upon
and
ned
britton
who
had
been
fully
warned
and
would
be
on
his
guard
against
all
dangers
was
shrewd
and
active
and
not
liable
to
be
caught
napping
what
then
had
they
encountered
wild
beasts
savages
or
some
awful
natural
phenomenon
which
had
cruelly
destroyed
them
our
imaginations
ran
riot
but
it
was
all
imagination
after
all
and
we
were
no
nearer
the
truth
an
anxious
night
passed
and
at
daybreak
uncle
naboth
called
a
council
of
war
at
which
all
on
board
were
present
we
faced
a
hard
proposition
you
may
be
sure
for
not
one
of
us
had
any
information
to
guide
him
and
all
were
alike
in
the
dark
to
desert
our
absent
friends
and
sail
away
from
the
island
was
impossible
even
had
we
desired
to
do
so
for
our
numbers
were
too
small
to
permit
us
to
work
the
disabled
flipper
in
safety
and
the
ship
s
carpenter
on
whom
we
greatly
depended
had
gone
with
the
mate
all
repairs
must
be
postponed
until
the
mystery
of
the
men
s
disappearance
was
solved
and
we
firmly
resolved
that
those
of
us
remaining
must
not
separate
but
stick
together
to
the
last
and
stick
to
the
ship
as
well
good
resolutions
indeed
but
we
failed
to
consider
the
demands
of
an
aroused
curiosity
after
two
days
had
dragged
their
hours
away
without
a
sign
of
our
absent
comrades
human
nature
could
bear
the
suspense
no
longer
uncle
naboth
called
another
council
and
said
boys
we
re
actin
like
a
pack
o
cowards
let
s
follow
after
our
friends
an
find
em
dead
or
alive
we
oughtn
t
to
shrink
from
a
danger
we
sent
em
into
and
if
we
can
t
rescue
em
let
s
run
the
chance
of
dyin
with
this
sentiment
met
with
general
approval
all
felt
that
the
time
for
action
had
arrived
and
if
there
was
a
reluctant
man
among
us
he
made
no
sign
early
next
morning
we
partook
of
a
hasty
breakfast
and
then
tumbled
into
the
long
boat
to
begin
our
quest
every
one
on
the
ship
was
to
accompany
the
expedition
for
no
one
cared
to
be
left
behind
uncle
naboth
at
first
proposed
to
leave
me
on
board
in
the
care
of
bry
but
i
pleaded
hard
to
go
with
the
rest
and
it
was
evident
that
i
would
be
in
as
much
danger
aboard
as
in
the
company
of
the
exploring
party
so
it
was
decided
to
take
me
along
and
we
practically
deserted
the
ship
taking
with
us
a
fair
supply
of
provisions
and
plenty
of
ammunition
the
men
were
fully
armed
and
my
uncle
even
intrusted
me
with
a
revolver
for
i
had
learned
to
shoot
fairly
well
it
was
a
beautiful
morning
cool
and
fresh
and
sunny
as
we
rowed
away
from
the
ship
and
headed
for
the
inlet
that
unknown
and
perhaps
terrible
dangers
lay
ahead
of
us
we
had
good
reason
to
expect
but
every
man
was
alert
and
vigilant
and
eager
to
unravel
the
mystery
of
this
strange
island
chapter
vii
the
major
presently
we
shot
into
the
opening
and
passed
swiftly
up
the
smooth
waters
of
the
inlet
the
hills
were
gradually
sloping
at
first
and
we
could
look
into
the
tangled
mass
of
forest
that
lay
on
either
hand
but
soon
the
sides
of
the
channel
became
rocky
and
precipitous
rising
higher
and
higher
until
we
found
ourselves
in
a
deep
gorge
that
wound
between
gigantic
overhanging
cliffs
the
waters
of
the
inlet
were
still
smooth
but
it
narrowed
perceptibly
all
the
time
curving
sharply
to
the
right
and
then
to
the
left
in
a
series
of
so
that
every
few
minutes
we
seemed
to
be
approaching
a
solid
rocky
wall
which
suddenly
disclosed
a
continuation
of
the
channel
to
right
angles
with
it
allowing
us
to
continue
on
our
course
it
was
indeed
necessary
to
watch
out
in
such
a
place
as
this
for
we
were
passing
through
the
heart
of
the
mountain
and
could
not
tell
from
one
moment
to
another
what
lay
before
us
there
was
barely
room
on
each
side
for
the
sweep
of
the
oars
so
that
we
had
to
pull
straight
and
carefully
but
after
a
time
the
deep
gloom
in
which
we
were
engulfed
began
to
lighten
and
we
were
aware
that
the
slope
of
the
mountain
was
decreasing
and
we
were
approaching
its
further
side
on
and
on
we
rowed
twisting
abruptly
this
way
and
that
until
suddenly
as
we
turned
a
sharp
corner
and
shot
into
open
shallow
water
the
adventure
culminated
in
a
mighty
surprise
we
were
surrounded
by
a
band
of
brawny
fellows
who
stood
waist
deep
in
the
water
and
threw
coils
of
rope
about
us
before
we
were
quite
aware
of
their
presence
at
the
same
time
they
caught
the
boat
and
arrested
its
progress
jerking
the
oars
from
the
hands
of
our
rowers
and
making
us
fast
prisoners
only
bryonia
was
quicker
than
the
men
who
sought
to
entrap
him
before
the
noose
could
settle
over
his
shoulders
he
leaped
into
the
air
and
dove
headlong
beneath
the
water
but
the
brave
attempt
to
escape
was
all
in
vain
for
as
he
rose
to
the
surface
a
dozen
hands
caught
him
and
drew
him
to
the
shore
where
despite
his
struggles
he
was
bound
as
securely
as
the
rest
of
us
so
unexpected
was
the
attack
and
so
cleverly
were
we
mastered
that
scarcely
a
word
was
uttered
by
our
little
party
as
we
stared
in
astonishment
into
the
rough
and
bearded
faces
of
our
captors
only
captain
gay
muttered
a
string
of
naughty
words
under
his
breath
the
rest
were
silent
and
uncle
naboth
bound
round
and
round
with
rope
so
that
he
could
not
move
sat
in
his
seat
and
looked
across
at
me
with
one
of
his
quaintest
winks
as
if
he
would
cheer
me
up
in
this
unexpected
crisis
nor
had
a
word
been
spoken
by
the
men
who
entrapped
us
wading
slowly
through
the
water
they
drew
our
boat
to
a
sandy
shore
and
beached
it
while
we
looked
curiously
around
upon
the
scene
that
was
now
clearly
unfolded
to
our
view
the
cliffs
had
ended
abruptly
and
the
center
of
the
island
flat
and
broad
lay
stretched
before
us
the
waters
of
the
inlet
from
here
became
shallow
and
a
wide
beach
of
strangely
bright
sands
extended
for
two
hundred
feet
on
either
side
of
it
then
came
the
jungle
thick
and
seemingly
impenetrable
beyond
which
all
was
unknown
straight
and
without
a
ripple
the
water
lay
before
as
a
full
quarter
of
a
mile
disappearing
thence
into
the
forest
on
the
thick
sands
of
the
east
shore
where
we
now
were
a
number
of
rude
huts
had
been
erected
shaped
something
like
indian
tepees
and
made
of
intertwined
branches
covered
with
leaves
from
the
forest
these
stood
in
a
row
near
to
the
edge
of
the
jungle
so
as
to
take
advantage
of
its
shade
but
more
strange
than
all
this
was
the
appearance
of
the
men
who
had
bound
us
they
were
evidently
our
own
countrymen
and
from
their
dress
and
manners
seemed
to
be
miners
but
nearly
all
were
in
rags
and
tatters
as
if
they
had
been
long
away
from
civilization
and
their
faces
were
fierce
and
brutal
bearing
the
expression
of
wild
beasts
in
search
of
prey
one
of
them
however
who
stood
upon
the
beach
regarding
us
silently
and
with
folded
arms
was
a
personage
so
remarkable
that
he
instantly
riveted
our
attention
his
height
was
least
six
feet
and
three
his
chest
was
broad
and
deep
as
that
of
ancient
hercules
he
was
bearded
like
a
gorilla
with
fiery
red
hair
which
extended
even
to
his
great
chest
disclosed
through
the
open
grey
flannel
shirt
there
was
no
hat
upon
his
head
and
he
wore
no
coat
but
high
boots
were
upon
his
feet
and
around
his
waist
a
leathern
belt
stuck
full
of
knives
and
revolvers
no
stage
pirate
no
bandit
of
southern
europe
was
ever
half
so
formidable
in
appearance
as
this
terrible
personage
he
stood
motionless
as
a
pillar
of
stone
but
his
little
red
eyes
quick
and
shrewd
roved
from
one
to
another
of
our
faces
as
if
he
were
making
a
mental
estimate
of
each
one
of
the
ogre
who
selected
his
fattest
prisoner
to
grace
his
i
own
that
i
shuddered
as
his
glance
fell
upon
me
and
we
were
all
more
or
less
disquieted
by
our
rough
seizure
and
the
uncertainty
of
the
fate
that
awaited
us
this
red
undoubtedly
the
leader
of
the
outlaw
band
for
having
pulled
our
boat
upon
the
beach
and
dragged
bryonia
to
a
position
beside
it
all
eyes
were
turned
enquiringly
upon
him
he
strode
forward
a
few
steps
fixed
his
eyes
firmly
upon
uncle
naboth
and
said
did
you
leave
anyone
aboard
the
ship
i
gave
a
start
of
surprise
the
voice
of
the
huge
bandit
was
as
gentle
and
soft
as
that
of
a
woman
no
said
my
uncle
i
guess
major
we
ve
got
em
all
now
remarked
one
of
the
men
the
giant
nodded
and
turned
again
to
uncle
naboth
you
must
pardon
us
sir
for
our
seeming
rudeness
said
he
with
a
politeness
that
seemed
absolutely
incongruous
coming
from
his
coarse
hairy
lips
my
men
and
i
are
in
desperate
straights
and
only
desperate
remedies
will
avail
to
save
us
i
beg
you
all
to
believe
that
we
have
no
personal
enmity
toward
you
then
he
turned
to
his
men
and
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
added
bring
them
illustration
captured
by
the
thereat
we
were
jerked
from
our
seats
in
the
boat
and
led
away
over
the
sands
toward
the
edge
of
the
jungle
i
noticed
that
our
arms
and
provisions
being
confiscated
were
carried
into
one
of
the
huts
but
we
ourselves
were
dragged
past
these
and
through
an
opening
in
the
trees
just
large
enough
to
admit
us
single
file
a
few
steps
from
the
edge
we
entered
a
circular
clearing
perhaps
a
dozen
paces
in
diameter
hemmed
in
on
all
sides
by
a
perfect
network
of
tangled
brushwood
and
vines
here
to
our
great
joy
we
came
upon
our
lost
comrades
all
seated
at
the
base
of
slender
trees
to
which
they
were
bound
by
stout
ropes
hurrah
cried
bill
acker
a
smile
lighting
his
careworn
face
it
s
a
joy
to
see
you
again
my
boys
although
you
seem
to
have
fallen
into
the
same
trap
we
beg
parding
cap
n
for
getting
myself
caught
said
net
britton
quite
seriously
the
brutes
jumped
me
so
quick
i
hadn
t
time
to
fire
a
all
right
ned
you
re
not
to
blame
said
captain
gay
and
while
we
were
interchanging
greetings
our
captors
were
busily
engaged
in
securing
us
to
trees
in
the
same
manner
the
others
were
bound
we
protested
very
naturally
at
such
treatment
but
the
men
surly
and
rough
answered
us
not
a
word
and
after
making
sure
we
could
not
get
away
they
withdrew
and
left
us
alone
as
the
trees
to
which
we
were
fastened
were
at
the
edge
of
the
clearing
we
were
seated
in
a
sort
of
circle
facing
one
another
well
boys
said
uncle
naboth
here
s
a
pretty
kettle
o
fish
i
must
say
the
whole
crew
o
the
flipper
officers
an
men
an
supercargo
has
been
caught
like
so
many
turtles
an
turned
on
their
backs
an
all
we
can
do
is
to
kick
and
wish
we
had
our
legs
we
all
seemed
rather
ashamed
of
ourselves
captain
gay
heaved
a
most
dismal
sigh
and
turning
to
acker
asked
who
are
these
people
bill
can
t
say
i
m
sure
tom
we
rowed
up
the
inlet
not
expecting
any
danger
when
suddenly
the
whole
lot
jumped
us
and
made
us
prisoners
in
the
wink
of
an
eye
they
brought
us
before
a
red
devil
called
the
major
who
pumped
us
to
find
out
how
many
men
were
aboard
ship
when
we
refused
to
give
them
any
information
they
brought
us
to
this
place
and
here
we
ve
been
ever
since
fast
bound
and
half
starved
for
i
guess
the
fellows
haven
t
much
to
eat
how
did
they
come
here
asked
my
uncle
really
sir
replied
acker
they
haven
t
told
us
one
word
about
fer
my
part
said
ned
britton
speaking
in
his
deliberate
manner
i
think
these
pirates
has
been
spyin
on
us
ever
since
we
anchored
in
the
bay
they
must
have
a
path
over
the
mountains
that
we
don
t
know
of
for
when
the
mate
come
up
the
inlet
in
the
gig
they
was
ready
an
waitin
for
him
and
he
didn
t
have
a
chance
to
resist
twere
the
same
with
me
sir
i
crep
along
the
edge
o
the
channel
goin
slow
an
swingin
myself
from
tree
to
tree
over
the
the
trees
was
too
thick
to
get
between
i
come
to
this
here
place
where
two
men
grabbed
me
an
knocked
me
down
an
tied
me
up
like
a
pig
sent
to
market
the
major
were
with
em
and
swore
he
d
murder
me
if
i
didn
t
tell
him
how
many
more
were
aboard
the
ship
an
what
her
cargo
was
an
where
we
are
bound
for
an
a
dozen
other
things
but
i
kep
mum
sir
as
were
my
duty
an
finally
they
brung
me
to
this
place
where
i
was
mighty
glad
to
find
the
mate
and
his
men
safe
and
we
then
related
our
own
anxiety
over
the
fate
of
those
who
had
so
mysteriously
disappeared
and
our
final
expedition
in
search
of
them
we
ve
found
you
all
right
said
uncle
naboth
in
conclusion
but
now
the
question
is
what
s
goin
to
become
of
us
an
what
shall
we
do
to
escape
from
these
blamed
pirates
that
s
captured
us
before
you
answer
that
question
said
a
quiet
voice
it
may
be
as
well
for
you
to
listen
to
what
i
have
to
we
looked
up
and
saw
the
great
form
of
the
major
standing
in
the
clearing
how
much
of
our
conversation
he
had
overheard
we
did
not
know
but
after
a
lowering
glance
into
our
startled
faces
he
calmly
seated
himself
in
the
midst
of
the
circle
thirteen
all
told
he
said
you
seem
shorthanded
for
so
big
a
we
lost
three
men
in
the
storm
said
uncle
naboth
what
are
you
the
owner
asked
the
major
part
what
is
your
cargo
mixed
replied
uncle
naboth
the
major
reflected
a
moment
we
shall
soon
find
out
all
we
wish
to
know
he
said
we
have
both
your
boats
and
we
can
examine
the
ship
for
i
s
pose
you
know
this
is
a
hangin
matter
suggested
my
uncle
it
may
be
was
the
calm
reply
at
any
rate
it
is
illegal
and
i
regret
that
circumstances
force
us
to
act
illegally
with
you
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
wish
that
i
might
have
treated
you
with
more
courtesy
but
you
had
no
business
to
come
to
this
island
and
having
come
here
and
surprised
our
great
secret
by
penetrating
into
the
center
of
the
land
you
must
take
the
consequences
of
your
folly
we
did
not
want
you
here
and
we
kept
out
of
your
way
as
long
as
you
would
let
us
when
you
invaded
our
private
domain
we
were
forced
to
protect
i
don
t
understand
said
my
uncle
much
puzzled
by
this
speech
we
re
no
robbers
ner
pirates
we
re
peaceful
citizens
of
the
united
so
are
we
retorted
the
major
but
we
re
also
the
creatures
of
fate
and
our
condition
here
forces
us
to
wage
warfare
upon
any
who
intrude
into
our
we
put
in
here
for
repairs
an
it
was
natural
we
should
want
to
explore
the
island
returned
my
uncle
doggedly
the
major
appeared
lost
in
thought
for
several
minutes
he
sat
staring
at
the
ground
with
a
great
frown
wrinkling
his
brow
for
our
part
we
watched
him
curiously
wondering
the
while
what
would
be
the
outcome
of
the
queer
condition
in
which
we
found
ourselves
finally
the
man
spoke
under
the
circumstances
said
he
there
are
but
two
courses
open
to
us
one
is
to
murder
every
man
of
you
and
bury
you
underneath
the
sands
i
imagine
you
would
be
safe
there
and
not
a
soul
on
earth
would
ever
know
what
had
become
of
i
shuddered
the
soft
tones
could
not
disguise
the
horror
of
the
words
the
alternative
continued
the
major
is
to
swear
you
to
secrecy
to
induce
you
to
work
for
us
for
fair
wages
and
finally
to
sail
back
with
you
in
your
ship
to
san
francisco
where
we
may
part
good
the
contrast
between
these
propositions
was
so
great
that
we
stared
at
the
man
in
amazement
if
we
are
to
take
our
choice
said
uncle
naboth
it
won
t
be
the
grave
under
the
sands
you
may
be
the
choice
does
not
lie
with
you
but
with
my
men
returned
the
major
coolly
for
my
part
i
am
neither
bloodthirsty
nor
inclined
to
become
a
murderer
so
i
shall
use
my
influence
in
your
with
this
he
slowly
rose
to
his
feet
and
stalked
from
the
clearing
leaving
us
to
reflections
that
were
not
entirely
comfortable
the
hours
passed
drearily
enough
toward
evening
some
of
the
men
brought
us
a
few
moldy
ship
s
biscuits
and
a
bucket
of
sweet
drinking
water
and
after
partaking
of
this
we
were
left
to
ourselves
until
the
next
daybreak
as
it
grew
dusk
nux
suddenly
rose
from
his
seat
and
we
saw
that
he
was
free
in
some
way
he
had
managed
to
slip
his
bonds
and
he
passed
quickly
from
one
to
another
of
us
until
we
were
all
released
from
the
dreadful
ropes
that
had
been
chafing
us
then
a
council
of
war
was
held
our
captors
numbered
about
thirty
and
all
were
fully
armed
to
attempt
to
oppose
them
openly
would
be
madness
but
if
we
could
manage
to
slip
away
and
regain
our
boats
we
should
be
able
to
reach
our
ship
and
so
escape
bryonia
agreed
to
spy
out
our
surroundings
and
see
where
the
boats
lay
so
he
fell
upon
all
fours
and
silently
crept
from
the
clearing
we
awaited
his
return
with
impatience
but
he
was
not
gone
long
he
the
clearing
walking
upright
and
indifferent
to
crackling
twigs
and
then
we
knew
our
case
was
hopeless
dere
s
men
sleepin
in
de
boats
an
men
on
watch
said
he
an
dey
all
has
swords
an
pistols
can
t
get
away
anyhow
mars
how
about
the
woods
asked
my
uncle
can
t
we
escape
through
them
bry
shook
his
head
decisively
he
was
an
expert
woodsman
and
declared
no
man
could
penetrate
the
thick
jungle
that
hemmed
us
in
ned
britton
also
bore
testimony
to
this
fact
so
we
were
obliged
to
sadly
abandon
any
hope
of
escape
and
stretched
ourselves
as
comfortably
as
we
might
upon
the
ground
to
await
the
approach
of
morning
with
the
first
streaks
of
day
the
major
and
a
dozen
of
his
men
arrived
and
without
appearing
to
notice
that
we
had
slipped
our
bonds
they
drove
us
in
a
pack
from
the
clearing
and
out
upon
the
sands
that
bordered
the
inlet
here
we
saw
others
of
our
captors
busy
preparing
breakfast
before
the
entrances
to
the
rude
huts
and
it
was
evident
that
they
were
using
the
provisions
they
had
captured
from
us
for
i
scented
the
aroma
of
the
coffee
that
uncle
naboth
was
so
proud
of
and
carried
with
him
wherever
he
went
we
gathered
before
the
hut
of
the
major
which
was
somewhat
larger
than
the
others
and
then
the
leader
said
in
a
tone
of
stern
command
take
off
your
we
hesitated
not
quite
understanding
the
purpose
of
the
order
strip
my
boys
said
another
of
the
pirates
with
a
grin
we
want
your
togs
we
drew
cuts
for
em
last
night
and
now
we
ll
trade
you
our
rags
for
so
we
stripped
and
tossed
our
clothes
upon
the
ground
where
they
were
eagerly
seized
by
the
outlaws
and
donned
with
great
satisfaction
the
major
did
not
participate
in
this
robbery
but
indeed
no
garment
that
we
wore
could
possibly
have
fitted
his
huge
frame
when
we
had
put
on
the
rags
discarded
by
the
others
we
were
a
curious
looking
lot
you
may
be
sure
uncle
naboth
had
a
fit
of
silent
merriment
at
my
expense
but
if
he
could
have
seen
himself
i
am
sure
he
would
have
choked
and
sputtered
dangerously
a
more
disreputable
appearance
than
that
we
now
presented
would
be
hard
to
imagine
but
our
enemies
did
not
profit
so
greatly
by
the
exchange
after
all
for
the
garments
fitted
them
as
badly
as
theirs
did
us
however
they
seemed
very
proud
of
their
acquisition
and
strutted
around
like
so
many
vain
peacocks
chapter
viii
the
sands
of
gold
the
sun
had
now
arisen
and
flooded
the
scene
with
its
glorious
rays
we
were
given
some
of
the
coffee
and
a
scant
allowance
of
food
for
our
breakfast
the
care
with
which
the
latter
was
doled
out
being
evidence
that
our
captors
did
not
know
that
the
flipper
was
loaded
down
with
provisions
as
soon
as
the
meal
was
concluded
we
all
gathered
around
the
major
s
hut
again
and
he
began
to
make
us
an
address
at
the
conference
held
last
evening
he
began
in
his
smooth
tone
we
decided
to
allow
you
to
choose
your
own
fate
it
is
death
on
the
one
hand
and
life
as
our
paid
employees
on
the
other
what
do
you
say
we
d
like
to
know
sir
said
uncle
naboth
what
you
are
doing
on
this
island
washing
gold
to
be
sure
said
the
major
are
you
so
ignorant
that
you
can
not
see
that
these
sands
upon
which
you
are
standing
are
wonderfully
rich
in
gold
why
i
hadn
t
noticed
said
my
uncle
and
then
we
all
curiously
stared
at
the
bright
billows
of
sand
that
filled
the
beach
on
both
sides
of
the
inlet
it
will
do
no
harm
to
explain
to
you
how
we
came
here
and
what
we
are
doing
said
the
major
it
will
help
you
to
make
your
seems
like
a
queer
place
to
look
for
gold
said
uncle
naboth
reflectively
but
even
then
i
can
t
see
why
you
ve
treated
us
like
you
have
or
why
you
re
so
blamed
secret
about
the
can
t
you
was
the
reply
then
i
must
jog
your
reason
with
a
few
sensible
suggestions
every
gold
field
yet
discovered
has
been
a
magnet
to
draw
men
from
every
part
of
the
civilized
world
the
result
has
been
that
the
first
discoverers
seldom
profit
to
any
extent
while
the
horde
they
draw
around
them
get
the
lion
s
share
that
has
been
our
experience
time
and
time
again
for
every
member
of
our
band
is
an
experienced
miner
we
ve
been
crowded
from
colorado
to
idaho
from
idaho
to
california
from
california
to
the
black
hills
and
back
again
finally
we
got
word
of
a
rich
find
of
gold
in
alaska
so
banding
together
we
chartered
an
old
ship
and
started
for
the
yukon
on
the
way
we
encountered
a
gale
that
blew
us
to
this
island
we
don
t
know
what
island
it
is
and
we
don
t
care
while
our
vessel
was
undergoing
repairs
we
rowed
up
the
inlet
as
you
did
and
discovered
these
sands
which
are
marvelously
rich
with
grains
of
pure
gold
before
your
eyes
gentlemen
lies
the
greatest
natural
accumulation
of
gold
the
world
has
ever
he
paused
after
this
impressive
statement
and
again
we
looked
around
wonderingly
we
can
t
get
it
all
that
s
true
resumed
the
major
but
we
have
decided
to
stay
here
and
defend
our
secret
until
each
one
of
us
has
secured
an
independent
fortune
then
the
swarms
of
can
settle
here
as
thickly
as
they
please
of
course
we
had
our
tools
with
us
and
a
good
supply
of
provisions
so
we
were
glad
to
let
alaska
take
care
of
itself
and
go
to
work
washing
out
the
wealth
that
lay
at
our
feet
we
knew
the
food
wouldn
t
last
till
we
were
ready
to
leave
here
so
we
decided
to
send
the
ship
home
for
more
provisions
the
captain
was
bound
to
secrecy
by
promise
of
a
big
share
for
himself
but
soon
after
he
sailed
away
a
great
storm
arose
and
probably
the
old
leaky
craft
never
weathered
it
for
that
was
over
a
year
ago
and
no
ship
has
reached
this
harbor
until
yours
we
listened
to
this
recital
with
eager
interest
for
it
explained
much
that
had
puzzled
us
and
uncle
naboth
remarked
it
s
a
strange
story
sir
but
i
don
t
see
why
you
treated
us
as
enemies
when
we
came
suppose
you
had
been
prospectors
like
ourselves
what
would
become
of
our
secret
then
but
we
re
not
was
the
reply
it
was
even
possible
our
captain
might
have
reached
shore
and
betrayed
us
in
that
case
you
might
be
the
forerunners
of
an
army
of
invaders
we
couldn
t
take
the
chances
sir
we
ve
been
disappointed
too
many
times
but
it
appears
that
you
were
merely
the
victims
of
the
elements
and
like
ourselves
were
driven
to
this
shore
in
a
gale
so
the
only
danger
to
be
feared
from
you
is
your
getting
away
before
we
re
ready
to
go
with
you
that
was
why
we
hesitated
between
murdering
you
and
using
your
services
to
enable
us
to
accomplish
our
task
sooner
than
we
otherwise
could
we
are
not
believe
me
nor
do
we
care
to
be
responsible
for
the
death
of
so
many
decent
men
but
the
lust
for
gold
has
made
my
fellows
desperate
and
with
immense
fortunes
within
their
grasp
they
will
stick
at
nothing
to
protect
themselves
and
their
that
s
only
natural
growled
uncle
naboth
i
m
glad
to
find
you
so
reasonable
said
the
major
having
discovered
this
field
ourselves
we
do
not
intend
to
share
the
gold
with
anyone
but
we
will
make
you
a
reasonable
proposition
we
will
pay
each
one
of
you
two
dollars
a
day
in
grains
of
gold
for
your
labor
and
you
must
buckle
to
and
help
us
to
get
out
the
gold
we
will
also
pay
you
in
gold
for
whatever
provisions
you
have
on
your
ship
or
other
supplies
we
may
need
and
when
we
have
enough
to
satisfy
ourselves
and
are
ready
to
sail
back
to
civilization
we
will
pay
you
a
reasonable
price
for
passage
in
your
ship
that
seems
to
me
to
be
fair
and
square
what
do
you
say
why
answered
uncle
naboth
with
a
gasp
that
s
all
we
could
look
for
if
we
got
to
alaska
we
re
traders
sir
an
expect
to
make
our
money
in
trade
the
only
thing
we
object
to
is
workin
like
dogs
to
wash
gold
for
somebody
you
ll
have
to
put
up
with
that
objection
returned
the
man
dryly
your
labor
will
shorten
our
stay
here
a
full
year
and
it
s
the
penalty
you
must
suffer
for
being
in
our
my
uncle
turned
to
his
crew
what
do
you
say
boys
he
asked
some
grumbled
and
all
looked
grave
but
a
glance
at
the
lowering
faces
of
the
miners
assured
them
that
discretion
was
the
better
part
of
valor
so
they
yielded
a
reluctant
consent
to
the
arrangement
there
s
one
p
int
howsomever
as
i
should
like
to
argufy
said
uncle
naboth
this
here
lad
s
too
small
an
delicate
to
work
at
the
washin
an
somebody
s
got
to
give
out
the
provisions
an
collect
the
pay
for
em
let
him
out
o
the
deal
sir
an
make
him
clerk
o
the
i
will
agree
to
that
said
the
major
promptly
when
we
get
back
to
the
states
we
don
t
want
to
have
anything
against
our
record
so
this
bargain
shall
be
kept
faithfully
on
our
side
i
ll
prepare
a
paper
which
every
man
here
must
sign
stating
that
you
accept
the
agreement
freely
and
without
compulsion
and
will
be
satisfied
with
your
wages
and
the
payment
for
your
groceries
and
supplies
also
you
must
each
one
take
an
oath
not
to
betray
to
anyone
the
whereabouts
of
this
island
after
you
leave
it
for
it
will
be
a
valuable
possession
to
us
even
after
we
ve
taken
enough
gold
from
it
to
make
us
rich
meantime
you
ll
be
well
treated
but
carefully
watched
to
some
extent
you
ll
be
morally
our
prisoners
but
the
only
hardship
you
will
suffer
is
to
labor
hard
for
a
few
months
at
a
small
that
s
agreeable
sir
said
my
uncle
and
the
men
accepted
the
arrangement
with
more
or
less
grace
then
the
conference
broke
up
our
sailors
as
well
as
captain
gay
the
mate
and
my
uncle
were
at
once
set
to
work
washing
gold
on
the
banks
of
the
inlet
their
numbers
being
distributed
among
the
miners
who
showed
them
what
to
do
and
supervised
the
work
it
appeared
that
all
the
gold
gathered
by
our
people
was
to
go
into
a
common
pot
to
be
distributed
equally
among
our
captors
but
each
miner
worked
for
himself
alone
and
was
entitled
to
whatever
he
secured
in
this
way
a
premium
was
set
upon
individual
industry
and
they
worked
eagerly
and
persistently
at
the
same
time
insisting
that
the
flipper
s
crew
did
not
loiter
the
major
whose
influence
over
his
rough
comrades
was
undoubted
retired
within
his
tent
to
draft
the
paper
we
were
to
sign
and
i
left
to
my
own
devices
wandered
here
and
there
watching
the
men
and
wondering
what
would
be
the
outcome
of
this
singular
adventure
at
noon
the
paper
was
ready
and
it
set
forth
clearly
and
fairly
the
terms
of
the
agreement
we
were
all
required
to
sign
it
as
well
as
every
miner
in
the
camp
and
then
the
major
took
possession
of
it
there
being
no
duplicate
after
the
midday
meal
six
of
our
sailors
were
selected
to
man
the
long
boat
and
then
accompanied
by
the
major
who
was
fully
armed
and
by
myself
they
rowed
down
the
inlet
to
the
harbor
and
we
boarded
the
ship
i
selected
such
of
the
provisions
as
were
most
needed
by
the
half
starved
miners
and
also
carried
away
a
number
of
blankets
as
the
nights
were
chill
and
the
blankets
would
prevent
much
suffering
two
trips
we
made
that
afternoon
and
when
the
miners
stopped
work
for
the
day
i
had
quite
a
heap
of
groceries
piled
upon
the
sands
instantly
they
surrounded
me
clamoring
for
supplies
which
i
served
to
each
man
as
he
demanded
them
they
paid
me
in
grains
of
pure
gold
which
they
drew
from
sacks
old
stockings
tied
with
a
string
and
even
pockets
cut
from
their
clothing
how
much
to
demand
i
did
not
know
and
some
paid
me
too
much
i
suppose
and
some
too
little
one
of
them
a
low
browed
black
bearded
fellow
called
larkin
obtained
a
quantity
of
goods
and
then
said
he
would
pay
me
some
other
time
but
the
major
insisted
that
i
be
paid
then
and
there
so
the
man
laid
down
a
pinch
of
gold
saying
it
was
enough
and
i
was
about
to
accept
it
when
the
major
drew
his
revolver
and
said
quietly
this
is
a
fair
deal
larkin
shell
out
the
fellow
uttered
a
string
of
angry
oaths
but
he
added
to
his
first
offering
until
his
leader
was
satisfied
and
then
went
away
vowing
to
get
even
with
the
to
avoid
further
trouble
i
brought
a
small
pair
of
scales
from
the
ship
next
day
they
were
not
very
accurate
i
fear
but
they
were
much
better
than
guesswork
the
major
and
i
figured
out
exactly
what
weight
of
gold
should
stand
for
a
dollar
and
i
was
allowed
to
put
my
own
price
on
our
supplies
but
i
took
care
not
to
be
exorbitant
in
my
demands
and
most
of
the
men
expressed
themselves
as
well
satisfied
with
the
arrangement
as
a
good
share
of
the
provisions
would
suffer
by
being
left
out
in
the
night
air
it
was
decided
to
build
a
warehouse
for
my
use
a
reg
lar
grocery
store
uncle
naboth
described
it
so
the
men
all
set
to
work
and
under
the
direction
of
our
ship
s
carpenter
soon
constructed
a
roomy
and
comfortable
hut
for
this
purpose
by
repeated
trips
to
the
ship
in
the
long
boat
i
soon
accumulated
a
good
stock
of
everything
our
cargo
represented
and
by
taking
off
the
covers
of
the
boxes
and
then
piling
them
on
their
edges
in
rows
i
soon
made
my
hut
look
like
a
prosperous
mercantile
establishment
surplus
and
unopened
boxes
were
utilized
to
form
a
counter
in
front
of
my
stock
and
here
i
placed
my
scales
and
weighed
the
gold
that
was
offered
in
payment
the
men
were
as
prodigal
as
all
miners
are
and
denied
themselves
nothing
so
long
as
they
had
gold
to
pay
for
it
so
my
stock
gradually
increased
in
gold
and
diminished
in
merchandise
and
the
men
were
well
fed
and
comfortable
but
the
sands
upon
which
we
so
carelessly
trod
were
wonderfully
rich
in
the
precious
metal
and
any
sort
of
industry
was
sure
to
be
repaid
enormously
by
the
glittering
grains
scattered
about
it
was
not
dust
you
understand
but
tiny
grains
resembling
those
of
granulated
sugar
the
richest
yield
was
derived
from
the
sands
at
the
bottom
of
the
shallow
inlet
and
the
practice
of
the
miners
was
to
wade
a
little
way
into
the
stream
scoop
up
a
basin
off
the
sandy
bottom
and
wash
it
until
only
the
specks
of
sparkling
metal
remained
as
it
was
difficult
to
care
for
this
properly
i
brought
from
the
ship
a
quantity
of
which
i
made
during
my
leisure
moments
into
stout
bags
about
the
size
of
sewing
the
seams
firmly
these
bags
i
sold
readily
to
the
miners
who
when
they
filled
one
would
usually
bury
it
beneath
the
sand
in
their
hut
so
that
it
would
be
safe
i
did
not
do
this
with
my
supply
however
but
piled
my
sacks
into
an
empty
box
in
one
corner
of
my
grocery
store
feeling
sure
there
would
be
no
theft
of
them
in
the
confines
of
our
little
camp
neither
did
the
major
secrete
his
hoard
which
lay
plainly
in
sight
of
anyone
who
entered
his
hut
and
the
major
s
store
of
gold
was
enormous
because
he
took
charge
of
all
that
our
men
washed
out
until
the
time
for
final
division
should
arrive
there
was
no
game
of
any
sort
that
we
knew
of
upon
the
island
but
the
men
caught
plenty
of
fish
in
the
upper
part
of
the
inlet
and
in
the
bay
upon
the
ocean
frontage
the
thickets
surrounding
our
camp
were
considered
absolutely
impenetrable
on
account
of
the
underbrush
and
creeping
vines
that
formed
such
a
thick
network
at
the
foot
of
the
trees
yet
there
was
a
man
named
daggett
who
it
was
rumored
had
found
a
way
to
traverse
the
forest
with
comparative
ease
this
daggett
was
quite
a
remarkable
person
and
enters
now
into
my
story
he
was
a
thin
withered
little
man
about
fifty
years
of
age
who
had
been
an
unsuccessful
miner
all
his
life
until
now
so
eager
was
he
at
first
to
take
advantage
of
the
great
opportunities
here
afforded
to
secure
a
fortune
that
he
would
work
by
moonlight
washing
gold
while
his
companions
slept
and
rested
from
their
labors
but
soon
he
conceived
an
idea
that
these
golden
sands
were
deposited
from
some
point
in
the
mountains
of
the
interior
of
the
island
where
solid
gold
abounded
in
enormous
quantities
so
he
quit
washing
and
began
a
search
for
the
imaginary
mountain
of
gold
cutting
a
secret
path
through
the
thicket
to
the
more
open
interior
and
passing
day
after
day
in
his
eager
quest
at
first
he
urged
some
of
his
comrades
to
join
him
but
they
only
laughed
at
his
idea
being
well
content
to
obtain
the
coveted
gold
in
an
easy
way
where
it
lay
plainly
before
their
eyes
but
daggett
did
not
desist
spending
day
after
day
in
roaming
through
the
wild
hills
in
his
fruitless
search
during
the
time
he
lost
in
this
way
his
mates
were
accumulating
a
vast
store
of
golden
grains
while
daggett
was
as
yet
only
in
possession
of
the
result
of
his
first
eager
labors
and
after
i
opened
my
grocery
store
he
was
obliged
to
exchange
pinches
of
his
small
substance
for
supplies
so
that
it
gradually
dwindled
away
to
a
mere
nothing
he
haggled
so
over
the
price
of
every
article
he
secured
that
his
fellows
jeered
him
unmercifully
calling
him
the
miser
and
berating
him
for
neglecting
his
opportunities
indeed
the
poor
fellow
was
desperate
at
the
last
for
he
alone
of
all
the
camp
was
still
poor
and
his
only
salvation
he
considered
was
to
find
the
hills
of
solid
gold
before
the
time
came
for
all
to
abandon
the
island
so
he
was
gone
for
days
returning
to
camp
to
secure
provisions
and
no
one
knew
where
he
wandered
or
seem
to
care
chapter
ix
the
outlaws
there
were
many
curious
characters
at
the
camp
as
i
suppose
there
are
everywhere
that
a
number
of
men
are
gathered
together
i
used
to
amuse
myself
studying
the
various
phases
of
human
nature
that
came
under
my
observation
with
the
result
that
some
men
attracted
me
and
some
repelled
me
aside
from
the
miserly
daggett
the
man
who
caused
me
the
most
trouble
was
the
surly
scowling
larkin
whom
the
major
had
threatened
to
shoot
on
sight
if
he
did
not
pay
me
for
everything
he
obtained
at
my
shop
he
was
a
lazy
fellow
and
did
not
seem
to
get
ahead
as
fast
as
his
companions
for
that
reason
sometimes
in
the
heat
of
the
afternoon
he
would
strike
work
and
come
into
my
hut
where
he
threatened
and
bullied
me
and
cast
longing
glances
at
the
sacks
of
gold
i
had
accumulated
uncle
naboth
who
by
the
way
labored
doggedly
day
after
day
as
he
was
commanded
often
warned
me
against
larkin
but
i
had
no
fears
being
assured
the
major
would
protect
me
from
the
villain
s
hatred
one
or
two
and
judson
for
evidently
disreputable
characters
and
affected
the
society
of
larkin
when
they
were
not
at
work
but
in
the
main
the
miners
were
decent
enough
fellows
and
seemed
to
have
no
thought
above
securing
a
fortune
from
the
wealth
of
the
golden
sands
they
paid
me
liberally
were
just
in
their
dealings
and
labored
industriously
day
by
day
so
as
to
lessen
the
time
of
their
captivity
upon
the
island
in
the
evenings
the
officers
and
crew
of
the
flipper
were
wont
to
gather
in
my
hut
where
they
smoked
their
pipes
and
conversed
more
or
less
gloomily
together
none
of
them
however
was
greatly
distressed
at
his
fate
and
it
was
wonderful
how
cheerful
uncle
naboth
remained
through
it
all
his
silent
merriment
and
sly
winks
were
by
no
means
lacking
in
these
days
of
tribulations
and
hard
work
and
he
found
many
opportunities
to
exercise
his
keen
sense
of
humor
in
one
way
his
fortunes
were
really
prospering
and
each
evening
he
weighed
out
the
day
s
receipts
in
golden
grains
and
calculated
the
profits
to
us
on
the
sales
i
suppose
these
must
have
been
satisfactory
for
he
never
complained
i
always
slept
in
my
hut
surrounded
by
the
store
of
merchandise
and
my
sacks
of
gold
but
the
rest
of
the
crew
of
the
ship
had
huts
of
their
own
nux
and
bryonia
occupying
one
together
one
night
after
i
had
been
asleep
for
some
hours
i
was
suddenly
awakened
by
the
muzzle
of
a
pistol
pressed
close
to
my
forehead
i
opened
my
eyes
and
saw
larkin
standing
beside
me
a
tallow
candle
had
been
lighted
in
the
hut
and
i
could
see
his
evil
features
distinctly
now
my
lad
said
he
keep
quiet
an
you
won
t
get
hurt
but
if
you
raise
any
rumpus
or
make
a
sound
i
ll
blow
your
brains
so
i
lay
quiet
but
i
kept
my
eyes
open
and
eagerly
watched
what
was
taking
place
in
the
room
besides
larkin
there
were
present
daggett
judson
and
worst
characters
in
the
camp
while
larkin
remained
beside
me
to
threaten
me
with
his
pistol
the
others
spread
out
a
blanket
and
dumped
into
it
every
sack
of
gold
i
possessed
this
they
secured
by
tying
the
corners
of
the
blanket
together
next
they
spread
another
blanket
and
threw
into
it
a
quantity
of
canned
meats
and
other
provisions
afterwards
tying
them
up
as
they
had
the
gold
then
hayes
took
the
pistol
and
stood
guard
over
me
while
the
others
crept
from
the
hut
they
were
back
in
a
few
minutes
however
bearing
another
blanket
heavily
loaded
and
now
larkin
resumed
his
place
beside
me
and
the
others
caught
up
the
three
parcels
and
after
extinguishing
the
candle
slipped
out
of
the
doorway
there
was
a
moon
outside
i
knew
but
it
was
quite
dark
in
the
hut
and
the
consciousness
of
being
at
the
mercy
of
the
scoundrel
beside
me
sent
cold
shivers
creeping
up
my
spine
after
waiting
a
few
moments
in
silence
larkin
spoke
look
sam
he
said
gruffly
but
in
a
low
voice
we
ve
took
some
gold
and
other
stuff
as
ye
know
but
we
ain
t
goin
to
do
murder
unless
we
has
to
if
you
ve
got
sense
enough
to
keep
still
for
a
solid
hour
an
make
no
fuss
you
ll
live
to
get
as
much
gold
or
more
as
we
ve
just
grabbed
but
if
you
try
to
raise
the
camp
or
foller
us
i
ll
kill
you
before
you
know
it
now
i
m
goin
to
stand
outside
the
door
for
a
solid
lay
still
an
count
sixty
seconds
to
a
minute
an
sixty
minutes
to
an
hour
if
you
move
before
that
you
re
a
dead
one
after
the
hour
ye
can
howl
all
ye
please
and
the
louder
the
better
i
ought
to
stick
a
knife
into
you
now
but
i
guess
i
ll
wait
outside
the
door
an
see
if
you
mind
what
i
tell
then
with
a
threatening
flourish
of
his
pistol
he
slunk
away
and
as
soon
as
he
was
outside
the
door
i
rose
up
and
followed
i
knew
he
was
lying
well
enough
and
that
his
threats
were
merely
meant
to
terrify
me
into
keeping
silent
until
he
escaped
he
considered
me
a
mere
boy
and
believed
i
would
be
too
frightened
to
cause
him
any
trouble
but
where
could
he
and
his
fellow
thieves
go
how
could
they
penetrate
the
wild
thicket
that
was
the
question
that
puzzled
me
and
then
i
remembered
that
daggett
was
with
them
who
was
reputed
to
be
able
to
travel
at
will
throughout
the
interior
of
the
island
when
i
reached
the
door
and
looked
around
i
could
at
first
see
no
signs
of
the
man
who
had
just
left
me
then
i
discovered
a
dark
form
creeping
along
the
edge
of
the
jungle
and
at
once
i
sprang
into
the
shade
myself
and
crept
after
him
he
was
going
slowly
and
in
my
eagerness
i
closed
up
most
of
the
distance
between
us
until
i
was
dangerously
near
but
he
did
not
look
around
and
while
my
eyes
were
fastened
upon
him
he
dropped
to
his
knees
pushed
aside
a
thick
bush
and
disappeared
into
the
thicket
that
was
all
the
information
i
wanted
just
then
so
i
hastily
marked
the
place
by
heaping
a
mound
of
sand
before
the
bush
and
then
ran
back
to
my
hut
as
fast
as
i
could
go
i
was
terribly
humiliated
at
being
robbed
so
coolly
of
the
gold
that
had
been
placed
in
my
care
and
rashly
resolved
that
i
would
recover
it
by
my
own
efforts
without
disturbing
the
slumbers
of
my
uncle
or
the
major
so
entering
the
hut
i
secured
three
revolvers
of
the
colt
type
and
several
boxes
of
cartridges
for
them
all
of
which
i
had
secretly
smuggled
from
the
ship
and
hidden
among
the
groceries
for
the
major
had
forbidden
any
of
our
crew
having
i
had
thought
that
an
emergency
might
arise
some
time
when
these
revolvers
would
be
useful
to
us
and
now
i
blessed
my
foresight
in
secreting
them
having
secured
the
weapons
i
ran
quickly
to
the
hut
of
nux
and
bryonia
and
cautiously
awakened
them
at
my
first
touch
bry
sprang
into
the
air
and
alighted
on
his
feet
what
s
matter
mars
sam
he
demanded
i
ve
been
robbed
bry
i
panted
robbed
echoed
nux
who
was
now
beside
us
yes
larkin
and
his
gang
have
taken
every
bag
of
our
through
the
dim
light
i
could
see
their
white
eyeballs
glaring
at
me
in
amazement
what
you
goin
do
mars
sam
asked
bry
i
m
going
to
give
chase
and
make
the
rascals
give
it
back
that
is
if
you
will
be
my
friends
and
stand
by
me
i
said
by
daybreak
every
bag
must
be
in
my
hut
sure
nough
murmured
nux
we
ready
mars
sam
announced
bry
quickly
then
take
these
revolvers
and
follow
i
gave
a
weapon
to
each
having
hastily
loaded
them
and
then
i
turned
away
followed
by
the
dark
forms
of
the
two
sulus
they
re
thieves
you
know
burglars
and
outlaws
i
said
so
if
we
have
to
shoot
them
down
no
one
can
blame
they
made
no
answer
to
this
remark
and
soon
we
had
left
the
camp
behind
and
reached
the
bush
underneath
which
larkin
had
disappeared
in
a
low
voice
i
related
what
i
had
seen
and
bryonia
who
was
a
master
of
woodcraft
at
once
dropped
to
his
knees
and
vanished
into
the
thicket
i
followed
closely
after
him
and
nux
brought
up
the
rear
after
creeping
a
few
paces
through
the
underbrush
bry
grasped
my
hand
and
raised
me
to
my
feet
and
i
discovered
that
we
were
now
in
a
but
narrow
path
which
allowed
us
to
stand
upright
it
was
dark
as
pitch
in
the
grim
forest
and
we
could
only
feel
our
way
along
but
it
was
not
possible
for
us
to
get
off
the
path
which
had
doubtless
been
cut
by
daggett
to
afford
his
entrance
into
the
interior
of
the
island
and
if
our
progress
was
slow
those
whom
we
pursued
could
not
proceed
at
much
greater
speed
themselves
so
we
crept
along
stumbling
over
roots
and
tearing
our
clothes
by
brushing
against
the
briars
on
either
side
for
a
period
of
nearly
an
hour
bryonia
glided
before
us
as
stealthily
as
a
panther
and
often
i
was
not
certain
but
that
he
had
left
us
far
behind
but
nux
made
as
much
noise
as
i
did
and
puffed
much
harder
to
get
his
breath
so
i
did
not
fear
being
abandoned
in
the
black
wilderness
the
ground
seemed
to
rise
gradually
as
we
penetrated
into
the
wild
interior
but
the
path
remained
as
narrow
as
at
first
now
that
my
first
excitement
and
indignation
had
cooled
this
midnight
pursuit
began
to
look
doubtful
of
result
the
robbers
knew
the
way
much
better
than
we
did
and
they
were
so
far
ahead
of
us
that
we
heard
no
sound
of
any
sort
to
guide
us
more
than
once
i
was
tempted
to
abandon
the
chase
for
my
folly
in
undertaking
it
grew
more
and
more
evident
but
the
two
blacks
had
no
thought
of
turning
back
and
i
was
ashamed
to
call
a
halt
suddenly
i
ran
plump
into
bryonia
who
grasped
my
arm
as
firmly
as
if
it
were
in
a
vice
and
held
me
rigid
nux
immediately
ran
into
me
but
stopped
short
at
the
moment
of
contact
what
is
it
bry
i
asked
in
a
whisper
look
he
answered
and
swung
me
around
in
front
of
him
then
as
i
peered
into
the
darkness
a
faint
ray
of
light
became
visible
in
a
moment
i
perceived
that
it
was
growing
bigger
and
brighter
and
then
i
knew
what
it
meant
they
ve
gone
into
camp
and
lit
a
fire
said
i
pleased
to
have
overtaken
them
dey
do
n
know
we
s
coming
chuckled
nux
from
behind
but
bry
stood
like
a
statue
holding
fast
to
my
shoulders
and
peering
over
my
head
at
the
enemy
we
could
now
see
that
the
forest
was
much
thinner
here
than
at
the
point
we
had
entered
and
just
beyond
in
a
little
hollow
where
larkin
and
his
men
were
encamped
the
trees
grew
quite
scattered
our
best
plan
said
i
after
a
moment
s
thought
will
be
to
creep
up
to
them
and
make
a
sudden
one
two
free
fou
counted
bry
in
his
deep
voice
no
use
to
tack
mars
sam
dey
got
guns
an
kill
us
all
we
have
our
revolvers
i
suggested
rather
disappointed
at
his
prediction
nux
an
i
hit
somefin
an
we
might
not
said
bry
if
we
hit
somefin
it
might
be
a
man
an
it
might
this
was
discouraging
and
it
called
to
mind
the
fact
that
i
was
not
much
used
to
myself
still
i
don
t
mean
to
go
back
without
doing
something
to
recover
our
gold
said
i
wait
whispered
the
black
and
swung
me
around
back
of
him
again
how
he
managed
this
i
do
not
know
for
the
path
was
very
narrow
next
moment
he
disappeared
as
if
the
earth
had
swallowed
him
up
nux
gave
a
laugh
and
sat
down
upon
the
ground
after
a
few
moments
i
followed
suit
squatting
in
the
place
i
had
been
standing
for
even
from
that
distance
i
could
see
by
the
flickering
firelight
the
dim
forms
of
the
robbers
gathered
around
it
and
now
i
perceived
that
bry
s
decision
was
wise
we
were
too
far
from
camp
to
expect
assistance
in
case
of
an
emergency
even
if
our
friends
succeeded
in
finding
the
entrance
to
the
jungle
that
was
so
cleverly
concealed
under
the
bush
so
whatever
was
to
be
done
must
be
done
by
boy
and
two
black
men
against
four
desperate
and
villains
who
would
stop
at
no
crime
to
retain
the
gold
they
had
stolen
evidently
they
did
not
fear
pursuit
now
for
we
could
hear
the
murmur
of
their
voices
as
they
laughed
and
shouted
at
one
another
we
waited
in
silence
for
a
long
time
and
as
the
gloom
of
the
silent
forest
became
intensified
by
the
distant
light
i
began
to
feel
for
the
first
time
a
thrill
that
was
akin
to
fear
finally
i
noticed
a
black
body
wriggling
its
way
toward
us
through
the
brush
like
some
huge
snake
and
a
moment
later
bryonia
stood
before
me
i
creep
close
an
hear
what
dey
say
mars
sam
he
reported
dey
goin
watch
all
night
i
watch
too
tomorrow
maybe
we
catch
em
you
an
nux
go
i
protested
at
once
that
i
was
not
sleepy
but
bry
led
us
away
from
the
path
to
a
quiet
place
where
he
had
found
a
bank
of
moss
and
here
he
cautioned
us
to
remain
quietly
he
himself
crept
once
again
toward
the
camp
fire
and
a
moment
later
was
wholly
invisible
nux
whispered
to
me
tales
of
bryonia
s
skill
as
a
woodsman
wherein
it
seemed
he
had
excelled
in
his
native
land
but
they
grew
monotonous
in
time
and
before
i
knew
it
i
had
fallen
fast
asleep
on
the
mossy
bank
chapter
x
the
rocking
stone
when
i
opened
my
eyes
it
was
broad
daylight
and
at
first
i
could
not
remember
where
i
was
but
as
i
sat
up
i
saw
before
me
nux
and
bryonia
seated
calmly
side
by
side
with
the
wilderness
all
around
me
and
the
distant
voices
of
the
robbers
echoing
faintly
in
my
ears
the
sun
was
up
for
i
could
see
it
glinting
through
the
trees
so
as
a
recollection
of
my
surroundings
came
back
to
me
i
asked
bry
what
was
going
on
he
said
the
men
were
breaking
camp
having
slept
late
and
that
presently
they
were
going
to
travel
still
further
into
the
interior
i
could
not
imagine
what
they
had
in
view
or
where
they
expected
to
hide
from
the
vengeance
of
the
men
they
had
plundered
but
bry
declared
we
could
follow
them
without
ourselves
being
seen
so
i
decided
not
to
give
up
until
we
had
tracked
them
to
their
hiding
indeed
they
had
one
presently
we
could
see
them
tramping
away
to
the
southward
carrying
the
gold
and
provisions
they
had
tied
up
in
the
blankets
there
must
have
been
two
or
three
hundredweight
of
the
gold
so
the
packages
were
heavy
and
they
had
to
take
turns
carrying
them
but
men
seldom
feel
overburdened
by
the
weight
of
gold
so
we
heard
no
complaints
from
the
bearers
bry
went
on
alone
hiding
behind
rocks
and
trees
but
keeping
the
men
well
in
sight
after
him
trailed
nux
keeping
bry
in
sight
and
then
as
far
away
as
i
dared
i
followed
nux
trying
to
imitate
the
example
of
the
blacks
and
to
hide
myself
as
well
as
possible
before
noon
i
grew
hungry
for
we
had
brought
no
provisions
of
any
sort
with
us
the
robbers
paused
to
lunch
and
then
went
on
but
although
i
searched
carefully
i
could
not
find
a
morsel
of
food
that
they
had
cast
aside
of
water
there
was
plenty
for
we
crossed
several
small
streams
but
food
began
to
be
more
precious
than
gold
to
me
and
i
vaguely
wondered
if
i
should
die
of
starvation
before
i
got
back
to
camp
at
evening
the
men
made
camp
again
this
time
in
a
little
clearing
strewn
with
fallen
logs
and
when
bry
rejoined
me
in
a
clump
of
trees
where
nux
and
i
had
halted
i
told
him
frankly
that
i
was
faint
with
hunger
and
that
unless
i
could
find
something
to
eat
i
could
not
go
on
i
have
no
doubt
the
blacks
were
hungry
too
but
they
were
more
inured
to
hardship
and
could
bear
it
better
but
bry
volunteered
to
try
to
secure
some
food
and
as
soon
as
darkness
had
fallen
he
crept
toward
the
camp
managing
to
approach
to
within
five
yards
of
the
camp
fire
around
which
the
robbers
sat
smoking
and
talking
he
was
concealed
by
a
huge
log
behind
which
he
hid
listening
carefully
to
the
conversation
which
he
afterward
retailed
to
me
so
far
larkin
was
saying
we
couldn
t
have
done
better
by
this
time
i
guess
we
re
pretty
safe
from
no
one
could
find
their
way
here
in
a
year
boasted
daggett
his
lean
face
grinning
with
delight
i
m
the
only
man
on
the
island
as
knows
the
are
you
sure
you
can
lead
us
to
that
queer
rock
you
tell
of
asked
judson
a
little
uneasily
sure
and
once
there
we
could
defy
an
army
returned
daggett
then
we
can
make
our
raft
row
out
to
where
the
ship
is
and
sail
away
larkin
gave
a
rude
laugh
ending
it
with
an
oath
there
ll
be
some
tall
cussin
in
the
camp
he
said
major
ll
be
crazy
assented
daggett
i
swiped
every
grain
o
gold
he
had
while
he
lay
chuckled
hayes
a
big
ruffian
who
was
called
dandy
pete
in
derision
because
he
was
so
rough
and
unkempt
pity
we
couldn
t
a
got
all
there
was
in
there
s
enough
to
make
us
all
rich
my
boys
anyhow
remarked
larkin
it
s
nearly
broke
my
back
luggin
of
it
an
there
s
only
four
of
us
to
at
this
they
seemed
to
grow
thoughtful
and
all
sat
silently
smoking
for
several
minutes
what
bothers
me

judson

daggett
promptly

added
larkin
they
looked
at
one
another
suspiciously
it
s
got
to
be
a
fair
divvy
said
dandy
pete
with
an
oath
or
else
there
won

be
so
many
to
divide
up
what
do
you

by
that
demanded
larkin
angrily
i
mean
i

stick
a
knife
in
your
ribs
if

any
trickery
with
me
replied
pete
scowling
you

the
terms

and
you

got
to
live
up
to

a
quarter

daggett
springing
to
his
feet
i
m
to
have
a
third
for
guiding
you
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
me
you
couldn
t
get
away
with
the
gold
at
who
promised
you
a
third
asked
hayes
well
let
larkin
make
it
up
to
you
out
of
his
own
share
i
m
going
to
have
a
and
so
am
i
said
judson
fingering
his
revolver
larkin
glared
at
them
with
a
white
face
we
won
t
quarrel
about
it
boys
he
said
after
a
time
there
s
plenty
for
all
and
we
must
hang
together
till
we
re
out
of
danger
i
ll
take
what
you
think
is
right
for
my
i
ll
take
my
third
an
no
less
growled
daggett
no
one
looked
at
him
each
seemed
to
be
busy
with
his
own
thoughts
bryonia
had
chosen
this
especial
log
to
hide
behind
because
the
robbers
had
placed
their
sack
of
provisions
upon
it
while
listening
to
the
conversation
i
have
recorded
the
black
had
stealthily
reached
up
his
hand
and
managed
to
extract
from
the
bundle
a
tin
of
corned
beef
and
a
handful
of
ship
s
biscuits
then
he
wriggled
carefully
away
and
in
a
few
minutes
had
rejoined
nux
and
me
where
we
hid
among
the
trees
i
think
no
food
has
ever
tasted
quite
so
delicious
to
me
as
did
that
tinned
beef
and
stale
biscuit
when
divided
amongst
three
there
was
little
enough
in
each
share
but
it
sufficed
to
allay
our
hunger
and
give
us
fresh
strength
and
courage
after
we
had
eaten
bry
decided
to
go
back
again
for
more
since
another
opportunity
to
purloin
from
the
bundle
of
provisions
might
not
be
offered
us
as
it
was
very
dark
by
this
time
nux
and
i
crept
nearer
to
where
a
big
rock
lay
and
here
hidden
by
the
deep
shadows
we
were
able
to
distinguish
clearly
all
that
transpired
around
the
camp
fire
bry
being
between
us
and
the
light
we
could
follow
his
creeping
form
with
our
eyes
until
we
saw
him
lying
safely
hidden
behind
the
log
with
the
bundle
of
food
just
over
him
by
this
time
all
the
robbers
had
lain
down
to
sleep
except
larkin
who
had
taken
the
watch
and
sat
moodily
smoking
beside
the
fire
on
which
he
tossed
now
and
then
a
handful
of
fuel
suddenly
as
he
looked
toward
the
sack
that
rested
upon
the
log
he
saw
it
move
in
an
instant
a
pistol
shot
rang
out
and
the
robbers
sprang
to
their
feet
with
cries
of
alarm
somebody
s
behind
that
log
shouted
larkin
who
was
himself
trembling
with
fear
at
once
bryonia
arose
to
his
feet
stepped
over
the
log
and
calmly
advanced
into
the
light
of
the
fire
holding
out
his
hand
in
greeting
and
smiling
broadly
into
the
angry
faces
confronting
him
don
shoot
poor
bry
he
said
pleadingly
i
se
run

to

exclaimed
larkin
while
the
others
looked
at
the
black
suspiciously
why
did
you
do

so

i
couldn

no

so
i
tried
to
steal

to

an
mars
larkin

shot

s
statement
was
so
simple
that
the
miners
were
inclined
to
believe
him
nux
and
i
who
had
crawled
nearer
to
the
fire
when
the
pistol
shot
rang
out
could
hear
distinctly
every
word
and
for
a
moment
i
was
horrified
that
bry
should
prove
false
and
desert
to
the
enemy
but
nux
was
chuckling
gleefully
and
whispered
dat
bry
he
mighty
clever
boy
mars
sam
so
i
began
to
comprehend
that
bry
was
acting
a
part
with
the
idea
of
saving
nux
and
me
from
discovery
and
ultimately
recovering
the
gold
therefore
i
kept
silent
and
listened
eagerly
evidently
the
miners
were
not
of
one
opinion
concerning
the
new
arrival
let
s
kill
the
nigger
said
daggett
then
we
won
t
run
any
don
t
be
a
fool
retorted
larkin
bry
can
be
useful
to
us
he
s
the
cook
of
the
flipper
i
m
told
and
besides
helping
to
carry
the
gold
he
can
cook
our
meals
when
we
get
to
sea
and
help
sail
the
if
he
s
run
away
from
camp
why
he
s
one
of
us
said
judson
yawning
and
sitting
down
again
and
if
it
comes
to
a
fight
he
counts
for
one
more
on
our
but
he
don
t
get
any
gold
added
dandy
pete
not
an
ounce
declared
daggett
don
t
want
any
gold
said
bry
composedly
only
want
to
get
all
right
decided
larkin
you
can
come
along
but
you
ve
got
to
obey
orders
and
the
first
time
i
catch
you
at
any
tricks
i
ll
put
a
bullet
into
bry
grinned
from
ear
to
ear
as
if
he
considered
this
a
good
joke
and
then
he
warmed
his
hands
over
the
fire
while
judson
brought
him
something
to
eat
from
the
bundle
afterward
all
lay
down
to
sleep
again
except
larkin
who
resumed
his
watch
it
was
too
soon
to
put
any
trust
in
bry
so
the
black
having
eaten
his
fill
lay
down
beside
the
others
nux
and
i
cautiously
retreated
to
the
rock
and
consulted
as
to
what
we
should
do
under
these
circumstances
the
black
man
had
perfect
confidence
in
his
comrade
and
proposed
that
we
should
still
follow
the
band
of
robbers
and
wait
for
bry
to
find
a
way
to
communicate
with
us
and
assist
us
this
seemed
reasonable
to
me
also
as
we
were
chilled
to
the
bones
in
the
cold
night
air
nux
suggested
that
we
go
into
camp
until
morning
and
led
me
a
long
distance
back
into
the
woods
where
we
finally
came
to
a
deep
hollow
here
there
would
be
little
danger
that
a
fire
could
be
seen
by
the
robbers
so
we
gathered
together
some
twigs
and
as
i
had
matches
in
my
pocket
a
fire
was
soon
started
that
proved
very
grateful
to
us
both
we
then
agreed
to
take
turns
watching
until
daylight
and
while
nux
lay
down
to
sleep
i
took
the
first
watch
but
in
some
because
the
fire
was
so
cosy
and
agreeable
gradually
lost
consciousness
and
when
morning
came
both
nux
and
i
awoke
with
a
start
to
find
the
fire
out
and
the
sun
glinting
brightly
through
the
trees
we
made
all
haste
toward
the
camp
of
the
robbers
but
when
we
arrived
at
the
place
we
found
it
deserted
they
could
not
have
been
gone
long
however
for
the
embers
of
the
fire
were
still
aglow
and
nux
who
was
keen
as
a
bloodhound
on
a
trail
declared
he
would
have
no
trouble
in
following
the
band
before
we
left
however
we
made
a
search
for
food
and
to
our
joy
discovered
behind
the
log
a
can
of
beans
and
some
more
biscuits
which
bry
had
evidently
found
an
opportunity
to
hide
there
for
our
benefit
we
began
the
chase
even
while
we
ate
for
nux
picked
out
the
trail
with
ease
and
threaded
his
way
between
the
trees
with
absolute
confidence
it
was
nearly
noon
when
he
halted
suddenly
we
had
come
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
before
us
lay
a
broad
barren
of
any
trees
or
brush
whatever
and
beyond
this
strip
of
rock
the
blue
sea
stretched
away
to
the
horizon
why
we
ve
crossed
the
island
i
exclaimed
only
one
end
of
de
island
corrected
nux
de
bay
where
our
ship
lays
ain
t
half
a
mile
it
surprised
me
that
the
shrewd
black
should
know
this
but
i
did
not
question
his
statement
just
now
my
attention
was
drawn
to
the
robbers
who
had
halted
upon
the
further
edge
of
the
which
even
from
where
we
stood
could
be
seen
to
form
a
high
bluff
above
the
ocean
at
this
place
it
ran
out
into
a
little
point
and
just
beyond
this
point
but
separated
from
the
mainland
by
a
wide
gulf
stood
an
peak
of
rock
its
flat
surface
on
a
level
with
the
bluff
it
must
at
one
time
have
formed
a
part
of
the
mainland
but
some
convulsion
of
nature
had
broken
it
away
and
now
a
deep
fissure
isolated
it
from
the
bluff
nature
was
responsible
for
two
other
curious
freaks
one
was
a
group
of
tall
pines
three
in
number
which
grew
on
the
separate
peak
where
there
seemed
scarcely
enough
soil
covering
the
rock
to
hold
the
roots
of
the
trees
yet
on
the
main
bluff
there
were
no
trees
at
all
the
other
phenomenon
was
a
great
rock
that
must
have
weighed
thousands
of
tons
which
lay
upon
the
edge
of
the
bluff
so
nicely
balanced
that
it
almost
seemed
as
if
a
good
push
would
precipitate
it
into
the
gulf
below
it
was
triangular
in
shape
and
the
base
rested
on
the
bluff
while
its
outer
point
projected
far
over
the
gulf
till
it
towered
almost
above
the
isolated
point
of
rock
i
have
described
the
robbers
when
we
first
saw
them
were
engaged
in
earnest
consultation
it
appeared
that
daggett
was
explaining
something
about
the
great
rock
for
he
pointed
toward
it
several
times
and
then
at
the
islet
the
others
leaned
over
the
edge
of
the
gulf
looked
into
the
chasm
below
at
the
triangular
rock
at
the
barren
islet
and
then
drew
back
and
shook
their
heads
then
daggett
whom
i
had
always
considered
a
coward
did
what
struck
me
as
being
a
very
brave
act
he
climbed
upon
the
sloping
rock
and
gradually
crept
upward
on
his
hands
and
knees
when
he
reached
a
point
above
the
center
the
huge
rock
began
to
tremble
daggett
crept
a
little
further
along
and
now
the
entire
mass
of
rock
which
was
poised
to
a
nicety
raised
its
vast
bulk
and
tipped
slowly
outward
daggett
slid
forward
the
point
of
rock
under
him
touched
the
islet
and
came
to
rest
and
then
he
leaped
off
and
stood
safely
upon
the
peak
while
the
relieved
of
his
weight
slowly
returned
to
its
former
position
a
cheer
went
up
from
the
men
and
they
hesitated
no
longer
bry
crept
up
the
stone
next
and
was
tipped
gracefully
upon
the
islet
one
after
another
hayes
judson
and
larkin
mounted
the
and
were
deposited
upon
the
rocky
point
together
with
their
bundles
of
gold
and
provisions
we
could
not
see
very
well
what
became
of
them
after
this
for
the
big
rock
hid
them
from
our
view
but
as
it
was
evident
they
could
not
get
back
least
by
the
same
means
they
had
employed
to
reach
the
islet
and
i
made
bold
to
creep
out
of
our
shelter
and
approach
the
point
that
jutted
outward
into
the
sea
then
to
our
surprise
we
saw
that
the
flat
top
of
the
rock
was
deserted
the
robbers
together
with
bry
and
the
treasure
seemed
to
have
vanished
into
thin
air
chapter
xi
the
cavern
from
our
better
position
we
could
now
see
the
sides
of
the
great
rock
which
reared
itself
nearly
a
hundred
feet
from
the
shore
and
stood
like
some
gigantic
flat
topped
obelisk
keeping
guard
by
the
lonely
sea
some
ancient
convulsion
of
nature
such
as
an
earthquake
or
a
lightning
bolt
had
evidently
split
it
from
the
main
precipice
of
rock
near
which
it
stood
for
the
huge
crevice
that
separated
it
and
which
extended
entirely
down
to
the
beach
almost
followed
its
outlines
in
every
particular
but
what
had
cast
up
that
great
and
placed
it
in
so
finely
balanced
a
position
that
it
could
be
made
a
curious
but
effective
bridge
to
the
isolated
peak
no
one
can
tell
another
freak
of
nature
doubtless
for
no
mortal
hands
could
ever
have
moved
so
great
a
weight
of
solid
rock
and
now
was
solved
the
problem
of
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
the
robbers
for
looking
over
the
edge
we
saw
them
creeping
slowly
down
the
side
of
the
cliff
a
natural
ledge
varying
from
one
to
three
feet
in
breadth
led
from
the
top
down
to
the
bottom
circling
entirely
around
the
crag
with
a
sort
of
corkscrew
regularity
it
was
a
dizzy
path
most
certainly
and
i
did
not
wonder
to
see
the
men
cling
fast
to
the
inner
side
of
the
rock
as
they
crept
down
the
tortuous
ledge
but
daggett
who
evidently
knew
the
place
well
led
them
fearlessly
and
the
others
followed
dragging
their
burdens
and
the
sacks
of
gold
dust
as
best
they
could
i
certainly
expected
to
see
one
or
more
of
them
tumble
headlong
at
any
moment
but
no
accident
happened
and
presently
as
they
descended
the
path
wound
around
the
opposite
side
of
the
rock
and
they
were
lost
to
view
i
wondered
if
i
would
see
them
again
and
if
it
were
wise
to
stick
to
my
exposed
post
of
observation
but
while
i
pondered
the
matter
daggett
came
into
view
again
having
passed
around
the
rock
he
was
now
two
thirds
of
the
way
to
the
sands
and
as
he
followed
the
ledge
on
the
inner
side
that
lay
next
the
face
of
the
main
cliff
i
saw
him
suddenly
pause
upon
a
broader
part
of
the
path
than
the
rest
and
then
disappear
into
the
rock
so
it
seemed
to
my
gaze
from
where
i
watched
one
by
one
the
men
came
after
him
and
one
by
one
the
rock
swallowed
them
up
with
their
burdens
and
now
passed
a
period
of
tedious
waiting
both
nux
and
i
had
counted
the
fugitives
and
saw
that
all
had
safely
descended
to
this
point
including
bry
but
what
had
become
of
them
now
was
a
mystery
what
shall
we
do
nux
i
asked
in
indecision
there
s
nothing
more
to
be
seen
from
the
black
whose
eyes
held
a
startled
expression
made
no
reply
but
he
crept
with
me
to
a
nearer
and
better
position
at
the
edge
of
the
cliff
beside
the
and
together
we
peered
over
into
the
abyss
now
indeed
the
strange
disappearance
of
the
robbers
was
explained
for
from
our
present
point
of
vantage
we
could
see
a
black
spot
far
down
on
the
inner
face
of
the
column
of
rock
where
the
ledge
passed
and
this
spot
was
evidently
a
cavity
into
which
the
men
had
penetrated
all
we
can
do
now
i
said
with
a
sigh
of
regret
is
to
wait
until
they
come
out
it
would
be
foolish
to
follow
them
into
that
nux
nodded
an
emphatic
approval
and
we
proceeded
to
lie
down
upon
our
faces
so
that
our
eyes
just
projected
over
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
in
this
position
we
watched
as
patiently
as
we
could
for
something
to
happen
it
was
fully
an
hour
before
the
men
reappeared
a
distant
sound
of
voices
raised
high
in
angry
dispute
was
the
first
token
that
the
desperadoes
were
quitting
the
interior
of
the
rock
then
larkin
and
daggett
came
out
and
stood
upon
the
ledge
the
others
crowding
behind
them
on
the
narrow
footing
while
their
guide
pointed
along
the
ledge
that
still
continued
to
lead
downward
they
were
without
burdens
now
either
of
provisions
or
gold
dust
but
the
two
axes
were
carried
over
bry
s
shoulder
and
another
man
bore
a
coil
of
rope
they
seemed
to
be
disputing
together
about
something
and
a
few
of
the
words
reached
our
ears
daggett
was
urging
them
to
follow
a
plan
he
had
proposed
while
some
of
the
others
demurred
it
s
too
hot
to
work
we
heard
one
of
the
men
declare
it
s
not
too
hot
to
hang
shouted
daggett
in
reply
and
you
ll
hang
every
mother
s
son
of
you
if
we
don
t
get
to
the
ship
that
seemed
to
be
an
effective
argument
for
after
a
few
more
words
of
protest
the
men
followed
daggett
along
the
ledge
bry
coming
last
of
all
the
path
was
broader
from
there
on
and
they
made
rapid
progress
soon
being
again
lost
to
our
view
around
the
rock
just
as
bry
disappeared
he
looked
up
and
saw
nux
and
me
eagerly
watching
from
above
for
an
instant
he
paused
to
wave
his
hand
and
grin
at
us
reassuringly
then
he
passed
around
the
edge
and
vanished
after
the
others
dat
bry
don
pear
to
be
much
scared
said
nux
in
an
encouraged
tone
no
i
answered
thoughtfully
he
s
got
some
plan
in
his
head
i
m
sure
to
help
us
but
where
have
the
men
gone
now
nux
could
not
answer
this
problem
but
after
a
few
moments
it
solved
itself
for
the
robbers
and
bry
appeared
upon
the
sandy
shore
close
to
the
water
and
walked
briskly
along
the
narrow
strip
of
beach
between
the
lapping
waves
and
the
grim
precipice
of
the
mainland
it
was
not
long
before
a
bend
in
the
coast
hid
them
completely
and
then
we
sat
up
and
looked
at
one
another
inquiringly
what
we
do
now
asked
the
black
let
s
go
down
the
rock
i
suggested
assuming
to
be
braver
than
i
really
was
they
ve
left
the
gold
behind
them
that
s
sure
and
the
gold
is
what
we
re
after
nux
once
we
have
recovered
that
it
doesn
t
matter
so
much
what
becomes
of
the
won
dey
come
back
enquired
nux
hesitatingly
i
hope
not
said
i
truthfully
at
least
not
until
after
we
ve
got
back
the
gold
but
there
s
no
time
to
lose
follow
having
thus
assumed
the
leadership
i
strove
to
banish
all
unmanly
fear
and
boldly
sprang
on
to
the
end
of
the
that
rested
on
the
mainland
slowly
and
with
caution
i
crept
up
its
incline
until
i
was
directly
over
the
gulf
it
was
now
that
the
stone
should
tip
but
it
seemed
that
my
weight
being
less
than
that
of
any
of
the
men
who
had
passed
over
was
not
sufficient
to
balance
the
rock
so
it
began
to
look
like
a
risky
thing
for
me
to
climb
further
up
the
tapering
point
but
it
s
got
to
be
done
i
muttered
to
myself
setting
my
teeth
firmly
together
and
then
summoning
what
courage
i
possessed
i
lay
close
to
the
rock
and
crawled
steadily
upward
digging
my
toes
desperately
into
the
irregular
hollows
of
the
surface
to
keep
from
sliding
into
the
gulf
that
yawned
below
higher
and
higher
i
climbed
and
at
last
the
huge
rock
trembled
and
then
gently
sank
beneath
me
for
a
moment
i
was
exultant
but
i
had
crept
so
near
to
the
slippery
point
of
the
wedge
that
i
could
find
no
rough
projection
to
grasp
with
my
fingers
and
therefore
as
soon
as
my
head
became
lower
than
my
feet
i
slid
headforemost
to
the
point
and
tumbled
off
before
the
had
reached
a
point
of
rest
upon
the
peak
fortunately
however
i
had
been
carried
over
the
gulf
and
although
i
lay
upon
the
very
edge
of
the
great
precipice
i
was
not
much
hurt
in
another
moment
i
managed
to
drag
myself
to
a
position
of
greater
safety
while
the
relieved
of
my
weight
reared
its
nearest
point
into
the
air
again
and
fell
slowly
back
into
its
original
position
nux
who
had
watched
breathlessly
my
adventure
and
escape
was
trembling
violently
when
he
in
turn
mounted
the
stone
but
i
called
out
to
reassure
him
and
his
greater
weight
caused
the
wedge
to
tip
more
quickly
so
that
he
effected
the
passage
to
the
rocky
peak
with
comparative
ease
once
beside
me
the
faithful
fellow
began
rubbing
my
limbs
briskly
to
renew
their
circulation
and
ease
the
bruises
and
it
was
not
long
before
i
felt
sufficiently
restored
to
announce
my
resolve
to
continue
the
adventure
come
on
nux
said
i
scrambling
to
my
feet
we
must
get
that
gold
before
daggett
and
his
gang
come
the
black
was
staring
at
the
now
removed
from
our
refuge
by
a
good
twenty
feet
how
we
get
back
again
he
asked
in
perplexity
i
don
t
know
said
i
that
s
a
question
we
ll
have
to
face
afterward
the
main
thing
is
to
get
the
gold
and
it
s
certain
that
if
we
can
find
no
way
to
escape
the
robbers
will
be
as
badly
off
nux
shook
his
head
dat
won
help
us
mars
sam
he
said
gravely
but
already
i
was
engaged
in
eagerly
peering
over
the
edge
of
the
peak
to
find
the
ledge
by
which
the
men
had
descended
and
in
an
instant
i
discovered
it
it
started
with
a
projection
scarcely
six
inches
wide
which
lay
nearly
four
feet
from
the
top
and
it
is
small
wonder
that
i
looked
at
it
dubiously
at
first
for
if
i
let
myself
over
and
missed
my
footing
i
would
be
tumbled
sheer
down
the
face
of
the
cliff
i
go
first
decided
nux
who
had
also
glanced
over
the
cliff
there
was
a
crack
in
the
rock
near
the
edge
which
afforded
him
a
hold
for
his
hands
and
clutching
this
the
black
let
his
body
slide
over
until
his
feet
touched
the
projection
now
mars
sam
he
said
you
hold
on
me
an
come
this
i
quickly
did
and
found
the
feat
much
less
difficult
than
i
had
feared
just
at
the
top
where
my
companion
s
feet
rested
there
was
sufficient
incline
to
enable
me
to
lean
against
the
rock
and
a
few
steps
further
on
the
ledge
widened
until
the
path
was
quite
easy
to
follow
i
went
first
followed
closely
by
the
black
and
although
it
was
not
a
descent
one
would
have
chosen
for
a
pleasure
excursion
there
was
little
of
danger
to
be
encountered
by
those
with
cool
heads
and
determined
hearts
such
as
we
strove
to
maintain
round
and
round
the
great
pillar
of
rock
we
crept
nearing
the
foot
gradually
until
we
came
at
last
to
the
side
facing
the
main
cliff
and
found
the
opening
of
a
large
cavern
beside
us
filled
with
eager
curiosity
i
took
a
step
or
two
inside
and
found
the
cavern
to
be
fully
ten
feet
in
height
and
about
fifteen
feet
in
depth
there
was
no
light
except
that
which
came
through
the
round
entrance
and
as
this
faced
the
side
of
the
cliff
it
was
so
shadowed
that
it
required
a
few
moments
for
me
to
accustom
my
eyes
to
the
gloom
so
that
i
could
see
plainly
the
interior
of
the
cave
its
floor
was
strewn
deeply
with
sand
an
evidence
that
when
the
waves
rolled
high
they
rebounded
from
the
face
of
the
cliff
and
deposited
their
sand
in
the
cavern
the
marks
of
numerous
footprints
however
were
all
that
could
be
seen
in
the
cave
and
it
did
not
take
me
a
moment
to
guess
what
had
occupied
the
robbers
so
long
they
ve
buried
the
sacks
of
gold
and
the
provisions
under
the
sand
i
exclaimed
sure
nough
agreed
nux
it
will
take
us
some
time
to
dig
for
them
for
we
don
t
know
exactly
where
to
look
i
continued
reflectively
so
our
best
plan
will
be
to
go
down
to
the
beach
and
discover
what
has
become
of
daggett
and
his
crew
and
whether
they
re
liable
to
come
back
here
before
the
black
readily
agreed
to
this
so
we
at
once
left
the
cave
and
continued
along
the
ledge
until
we
reached
the
sand
the
path
became
quite
broad
in
this
part
and
our
descent
was
therefore
concluded
very
rapidly
once
on
the
shore
we
walked
briskly
along
until
we
had
turned
the
bend
in
the
beach
which
curved
to
follow
the
lines
of
a
little
bay
here
we
paused
for
a
long
stretch
of
the
beach
was
now
opened
to
our
gaze
from
this
point
the
shore
widened
out
for
the
precipitous
mainland
shrank
backward
and
decreased
gradually
in
height
until
a
half
mile
or
so
further
on
it
reached
the
level
plain
and
merged
into
a
deep
forest
which
grew
almost
down
to
the
edge
of
the
sea
no
human
being
was
in
sight
so
we
naturally
concluded
that
the
robbers
had
entered
the
forest
being
curious
to
discover
what
they
were
doing
without
hesitation
we
decided
to
follow
them
and
their
path
was
easily
traced
by
the
footprints
in
the
sand
these
led
straight
to
the
forest
and
although
somewhat
fearful
that
the
enemy
would
discover
our
presence
we
proceeded
to
walk
boldly
around
the
shore
of
the
little
bay
until
we
came
to
the
edge
of
the
trees
a
sound
of
voices
mingled
with
the
strokes
of
the
axes
now
guided
us
and
stealthily
creeping
among
the
thick
underbrush
we
soon
discovered
the
robbers
busily
at
work
judson
and
dandy
pete
were
trimming
the
branches
from
a
fallen
while
the
others
were
rolling
and
dragging
another
big
log
toward
the
sea
the
glistening
waters
being
perceptible
but
a
few
yards
away
evidently
the
men
were
intending
to
build
a
raft
and
after
listening
for
a
few
minutes
to
their
disjointed
conversation
we
learned
that
the
raft
was
designed
to
convey
them
and
their
stolen
wealth
to
the
ship
while
daggett
larkin
and
bry
tugged
and
dragged
at
the
log
nux
and
i
crept
away
to
the
shore
where
we
found
two
big
logs
already
lying
upon
the
sands
also
we
could
now
plainly
see
sheltered
in
another
bay
the
flipper
lying
quietly
at
her
anchorage
as
nux
had
wisely
predicted
the
schemes
of
the
robbers
were
now
fully
explained
under
cover
of
the
forest
by
day
and
hidden
in
their
cave
by
night
they
intended
to
complete
the
raft
and
when
it
was
ready
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
steal
away
to
the
ship
with
the
treasure
under
cover
of
darkness
hoist
the
sails
and
creep
out
to
sea
bidding
defiance
to
the
major
and
his
comrades
and
leaving
the
miners
and
the
flipper
s
crew
to
perish
on
the
lonely
island
but
the
construction
of
the
raft
would
require
days
at
after
getting
the
logs
to
the
shore
they
must
be
fastened
together
by
secured
with
wooden
pegs
since
there
was
not
enough
rope
in
their
possession
to
bind
the
together
once
more
returning
to
a
part
of
the
underbrush
near
which
the
men
were
employed
nux
and
i
settled
ourselves
to
listen
attentively
to
their
conversation
presently
we
heard
daggett
say
this
rate
we
ll
have
the
raft
ready
by
saturday
and
saturday
night
we
ll
take
the
it
s
beastly
hard
work
growled
dandy
pete
brushing
with
his
sleeve
the
sweat
from
his
brow
yes
but
it
means
liberty
and
riches
to
every
one
of
us
said
daggett
and
that
was
an
argument
none
cared
to
deny
just
then
i
was
startled
at
hearing
low
voices
just
beside
me
and
instinctively
i
touched
the
black
s
shoulder
and
we
crouched
lower
in
the
bushes
nux
indeed
with
a
woodsman
s
instinct
was
quite
flat
upon
the
ground
lifeless
and
invisible
and
i
strove
to
imitate
him
it
s
as
easy
as
can
be
said
the
voice
which
i
recognized
as
that
of
larkin
we
ll
let
the
fools
work
until
the
raft
is
finished
and
then
we
ll
put
our
knives
in
their
hearts
and
have
the
gold
for
how
about
bry
asked
judson
hoarsely
whispering
to
his
murderous
comrade
oh
he
won
t
interfere
any
was
the
reply
and
we
need
the
nigger
to
help
us
work
the
can
three
of
us
manage
the
vessel
of
course
with
good
weather
we
ll
have
to
take
our
chances
of
a
storm
but
the
fewer
there
are
to
divide
up
the
bigger
our
fortunes
will
be
we
won
t
give
the
nigger
a
cent
but
go
halves
on
the
whole
thing
perhaps
we
can
sell
the
ship
too
for
a
good
all
right
i
m
with
you
declared
judson
with
an
oath
and
then
the
two
conspirators
crept
away
and
rejoined
the
others
unconscious
that
their
diabolical
plot
had
been
overheard
chapter
xii
we
recover
the
gold
thinking
over
the
matter
i
decided
to
return
at
once
to
the
cave
the
thieves
would
doubtless
be
occupied
in
the
forest
until
sundown
and
such
a
chance
as
this
to
secure
possession
of
the
gold
might
never
occur
again
for
if
daggett
or
his
men
chanced
to
see
our
footprints
in
the
sand
or
suspected
they
were
being
spied
upon
they
would
be
liable
to
leave
a
guard
in
the
cave
thereafter
so
we
softly
crept
from
the
forest
and
made
our
way
back
by
the
same
route
we
had
come
taking
care
to
tread
in
the
trail
made
by
the
robbers
so
that
our
footprints
could
be
less
easily
distinguished
we
did
not
feel
entirely
safe
from
observation
until
we
had
regained
the
column
of
rock
which
towered
into
the
air
beside
the
precipitous
cliff
but
once
our
feet
were
on
the
narrow
ledge
both
i
and
my
faithful
sulu
breathed
easier
and
with
more
deliberation
accomplished
the
ascent
to
the
cave
now
said
i
we
must
work
carefully
so
that
no
spot
of
sand
can
escape
us
for
the
thieves
have
taken
care
to
disturb
the
surface
everywhere
in
order
to
throw
any
chance
visitor
to
this
off
the
track
but
we
know
the
gold
is
buried
in
this
cave
nux
so
it
ought
not
to
be
a
very
hard
job
to
find
nux
nodded
with
his
usual
complaisance
we
begin
in
back
he
suggested
and
work
this
seemed
sensible
so
i
followed
the
black
to
the
far
end
of
the
cavern
and
falling
upon
our
knees
we
immediately
began
digging
with
our
hands
into
the
soft
sand
for
nearly
an
hour
we
steadily
worked
finding
nothing
at
all
then
as
i
stopped
to
rest
i
cast
a
careless
glance
along
the
rocky
sides
of
the
cave
and
thought
that
i
saw
a
white
mark
upon
the
wall
a
few
feet
toward
the
front
springing
to
my
feet
i
approached
this
point
and
discovered
that
a
small
cross
had
been
made
with
a
piece
of
chalk
or
a
bit
of
white
limestone
here
we
are
nux
i
cried
joyfully
and
at
once
began
digging
in
the
sand
beneath
the
mark
a
few
minutes
work
proved
that
my
sudden
suspicion
was
correct
for
nux
who
had
straightway
joined
me
dragged
one
of
the
sacks
to
light
while
i
discovered
another
just
beside
it
it
was
part
of
the
stolen
gold
sure
enough
and
my
heart
beat
fast
with
excitement
as
i
realized
that
the
precious
hoard
was
once
more
in
my
possession
only
a
part
had
been
hidden
in
this
place
we
found
but
now
we
had
an
unmistakeable
clew
to
guide
us
so
that
we
had
little
difficulty
in
finding
a
second
secret
mark
that
resulted
in
the
discovery
of
the
balance
of
the
treasure
as
well
as
the
sacks
of
provisions
when
all
had
been
unearthed
nux
asked
what
we
do
now
mars
sam
why
carry
it
away
of
course
i
answered
joyous
and
elate
where
enquired
the
black
simply
i
looked
at
him
in
surprise
and
then
realizing
the
meaning
of
the
question
grew
thoughtful
again
you
re
right
nux
said
i
it
s
going
to
be
a
harder
task
than
i
thought
we
can
t
pass
by
the
forest
with
it
that
s
certain
for
daggett
and
his
followers
would
be
sure
to
see
us
on
the
other
side
the
cliff
rises
straight
out
of
the
sea
and
there
s
no
way
to
escape
around
it
all
we
can
do
then
is
to
carry
the
gold
to
the
top
of
this
hm
granted
the
sulu
dat
no
good
mars
why
not
no
way
to
get
off
top
of
true
but
we
can
hide
there
till
the
thieves
go
away
to
the
ship
it
isn
t
likely
they
ll
climb
up
there
again
for
this
cave
is
a
better
place
to
sleep
nux
seemed
unconvinced
and
i
had
none
too
much
confidence
in
my
own
assertion
tonight
said
the
black
in
a
dismal
tone
dey
hunt
for
de
gold
all
gone
robber
very
mad
dey
look
ev
rywhere
den
dey
find
us
on
rock
den
dey
kill
that
s
a
pretty
tough
prophecy
nux
i
returned
as
cheerfully
as
i
could
and
it
sounds
likely
enough
i
confess
we
ve
got
the
gold
again
to
be
sure
but
the
robbers
have
got
us
so
we
re
worse
off
than
we
were
nux
took
a
lump
of
bread
from
a
provision
sack
and
begun
to
munch
it
leisurely
noticing
the
action
and
remembering
that
i
also
was
hungry
i
proceeded
to
follow
the
black
s
example
while
we
ate
however
my
sulu
was
busily
thinking
and
so
was
i
as
a
result
i
presently
gave
my
leg
a
delighted
slap
and
began
to
laugh
nux
looked
at
me
with
a
grin
of
sympathy
upon
his
black
features
what
s
matter
mars
sam
nux
said
i
checking
my
amusement
and
trying
to
look
grave
and
impressive
there
s
an
old
saying
that
there
s
never
a
lock
so
strong
but
there
s
a
key
to
fit
it
in
other
words
while
there
s
life
there
s
hope
never
give
up
the
ship
every
sky
has
a
silver
lining
nux
looked
puzzled
that
s
a
lovely
pair
of
trousers
you
re
wearing
nux
i
continued
in
a
jocular
strain
they
re
made
of
the
stoutest
cloth
uncle
naboth
could
find
in
san
francisco
and
i
gave
them
to
you
out
of
the
ship
s
stores
only
three
or
four
days
ago
because
your
old
ones
were
so
nux
glanced
at
his
blue
trousers
and
nodded
now
old
man
said
i
you
ve
often
told
me
you
used
to
go
and
in
your
own
island
so
i
m
going
to
ask
you
to
go
a
little
while
now
and
lend
me
those
wha
for
mars
sam
to
put
the
gold
grains
in
of
course
the
robbers
may
look
for
the
sacks
of
gold
when
they
come
back
but
they
re
pretty
sure
not
to
open
them
therefore
my
friend
we
ll
fix
it
so
that
they
ll
think
their
gold
is
all
how
mars
sam
by
filling
the
sacks
with
sand
and
burying
them
again
where
we
found
nux
looked
at
me
admiringly
and
grinned
until
his
mouth
stretched
from
ear
to
ear
and
displayed
every
one
of
his
white
teeth
good
mars
sam
he
cried
and
at
once
stripped
the
trousers
from
his
legs
i
now
hunted
in
the
pockets
of
my
jacket
and
brought
out
several
small
bits
of
cord
which
i
knotted
firmly
together
then
i
tied
the
legs
of
nux
s
trousers
tightly
at
the
bottoms
thus
transforming
them
into
a
double
sack
of
great
capacity
it
did
not
take
us
long
to
transfer
the
gold
dust
from
the
canvas
bags
to
the
and
as
soon
as
this
task
was
accomplished
we
refilled
the
bags
with
sand
and
tied
up
as
before
i
was
obliged
to
tear
away
a
part
of
my
own
shirt
to
get
material
with
which
to
tie
the
upper
part
of
the
trousers
for
i
did
not
wish
to
deprive
poor
nux
of
his
entire
apparel
the
sulu
looked
funny
enough
dressed
only
in
his
shoes
and
shirt
with
his
black
legs
between
them
and
more
than
once
i
was
obliged
to
pause
and
laugh
heartily
at
my
comrade
s
appearance
but
nux
didn
t
seem
to
mind
and
soon
the
seriousness
of
our
position
and
the
necessity
to
hasten
caused
me
to
forget
the
queer
costume
of
my
follower
we
abstracted
but
a
slender
supply
of
provisions
from
the
sacks
for
we
did
not
wish
to
arouse
suspicion
by
taking
too
much
the
next
task
was
to
bury
the
sacks
of
sand
and
the
provisions
exactly
as
they
had
been
before
and
to
smooth
over
the
surface
of
the
sand
and
trample
it
down
just
as
we
had
found
it
when
we
first
entered
the
cave
this
being
accomplished
to
our
complete
satisfaction
nux
lifted
the
heavy
gold
over
his
shoulder
one
leg
hanging
behind
his
back
and
one
in
front
and
started
to
mount
the
narrow
ledge
of
rock
with
his
burden
while
i
followed
close
behind
to
render
any
assistance
i
could
the
sulu
was
a
wonderfully
strong
man
but
his
task
was
a
difficult
one
although
i
tried
to
relieve
him
in
the
worst
places
by
lifting
a
part
of
the
heavy
load
our
progress
was
slow
for
poor
nux
had
to
stop
frequently
to
put
down
his
load
and
rest
and
it
was
while
we
were
on
the
outer
surface
of
the
rock
which
faced
the
sea
that
we
were
suddenly
startled
by
hearing
sounds
that
assured
us
the
robbers
were
returning
from
the
forest
much
time
had
been
consumed
in
the
cave
searching
for
the
treasure
and
securing
it
and
now
i
began
to
fear
we
had
delayed
too
long
illustration
a
hazardous
climb
just
at
this
time
the
men
could
not
see
us
but
as
soon
as
they
mounted
the
ledge
and
began
to
wind
around
the
tower
of
rock
they
would
be
sure
to
catch
sight
of
our
forms
and
then
our
fate
would
be
sealed
nux
i
whispered
pick
up
the
gold
and
be
ready
to
start
as
soon
as
the
thieves
get
back
to
the
ledge
we
must
go
on
and
keep
the
rock
always
between
us
and
them
or
we
shall
be
nux
nodded
and
obeyed
without
a
word
it
was
often
hard
to
tell
by
the
sound
of
their
voices
just
how
far
up
the
ledge
the
men
had
progressed
but
fortune
favored
us
and
only
once
did
we
lag
behind
enough
for
the
first
of
the
robber
band
to
espy
us
but
that
first
person
by
good
luck
proved
to
be
bryonia
and
the
clever
black
at
once
pretended
to
stumble
and
fall
and
so
held
the
men
that
followed
him
in
check
until
nux
and
i
had
escaped
around
the
crag
soon
after
this
the
robbers
reached
the
cave
which
they
entered
thus
enabling
us
to
reach
the
top
of
the
crag
at
our
leisure
nux
was
nearly
spent
when
at
last
he
threw
the
laden
trousers
upon
the
flat
top
and
tried
to
draw
his
tired
body
after
them
but
i
gave
him
a
hearty
boost
from
behind
and
then
scrambled
to
the
top
unaided
nerved
by
the
excitement
of
the
moment
for
several
minutes
neither
of
us
spoke
the
black
man
lay
panting
for
breath
with
the
perspiration
streaming
from
every
pore
of
his
body
and
i
filled
with
gratitude
at
our
escape
and
the
successful
accomplishment
of
our
plan
sat
beside
my
faithful
friend
and
fanned
him
with
my
straw
hat
the
sun
was
sinking
fast
by
this
time
and
the
shadows
of
the
three
tall
pine
trees
that
grew
upon
this
isolated
peak
fell
upon
the
spot
where
we
rested
and
cooled
our
bodies
although
at
times
a
rough
laugh
or
a
shouted
curse
reached
our
ears
from
the
cavern
below
there
was
no
indication
that
daggett
or
his
band
had
yet
made
the
discovery
that
the
place
had
been
visited
in
their
absence
and
the
treasure
for
which
they
had
risked
so
much
abstracted
from
its
sandy
grave
when
twilight
fell
i
arose
and
with
some
difficulty
rolled
the
trousers
to
a
place
nearer
the
center
of
the
rock
where
there
was
a
small
natural
hollow
and
then
nux
and
i
sat
beside
it
and
ate
again
sparingly
of
the
food
we
had
brought
it
was
while
we
were
thus
occupied
that
an
incident
occurred
that
filled
us
with
sudden
panic
for
before
our
faces
a
man
s
head
appeared
above
the
edge
of
rock
and
two
dark
eyes
glared
fixedly
into
our
own
at
the
moment
i
almost
screamed
with
fright
so
unnerved
had
my
recent
adventures
rendered
me
but
nux
laid
his
broad
hand
across
my
mouth
and
arrested
the
outcry
it
s
bry
he
whispered
and
even
as
he
spoke
the
newcomer
drew
himself
over
the
edge
and
crept
on
all
fours
to
our
side
i
had
no
trouble
in
recognizing
the
friendly
features
then
oh
bry
i
so
as
not
to
be
heard
by
the
robbers
clasped
the
black
hands
fervently
in
both
my
own
bry
squatted
beside
us
his
kindly
face
wreathed
in
smiles
dey
send
me
up
here
to
see
if
anyone
round
he
whispered
in
a
minute
i
go
back
and
say

you
stay
with
us

i
asked
pleadingly
not
yet

laughed
silently

he
said
but
when

steal

you

approvingly

again
very
good
way
to
fool

but

remarked

you
and
we
go
to
camp
all
right
bry
said
i
as
cheerfully
as
possible
then
the
black
bade
us
and
returned
to
the
cave
to
report
to
daggett
that
no
one
was
to
be
seen
anywhere
about
and
now
nux
and
i
wearied
by
the
adventures
of
the
day
but
buoyed
by
the
hope
that
we
might
finally
escape
with
the
recovered
gold
lay
down
upon
the
rocky
eminence
and
bathed
by
the
moon
s
silver
rays
slept
peacefully
until
morning
chapter
xiii
the
catastrophe
i
was
awakened
by
the
voices
of
the
robbers
who
were
leaving
the
cave
early
in
order
to
complete
their
raft
by
nightfall
it
was
evident
that
they
had
not
suspected
our
intrusion
into
their
retreat
or
the
fact
that
their
stolen
treasure
had
been
taken
from
them
indeed
they
seemed
in
high
spirits
especially
larkin
and
judson
who
were
doubtless
eager
to
carry
out
their
nefarious
plan
of
murdering
their
comrades
as
soon
as
the
work
on
the
raft
was
finished
daggett
might
also
harbor
a
conspiracy
to
secure
the
bulk
of
the
treasure
and
probably
all
the
members
of
the
evil
band
were
looking
forward
to
this
coming
night
to
end
their
suspense
and
give
them
an
advantage
one
over
the
other
honor
among
thieves
has
often
been
quoted
but
in
this
instance
as
in
many
others
that
could
be
mentioned
the
thieves
were
as
lacking
in
honor
as
they
were
in
honesty
from
my
elevated
perch
i
watched
them
file
along
the
ledge
to
the
sands
and
upon
reaching
the
level
set
off
toward
the
forest
not
till
they
were
well
out
of
sight
did
nux
or
i
venture
to
rise
upright
and
stretch
our
limbs
the
morning
was
warm
and
sultry
the
sun
gleamed
hot
in
a
cloudless
sky
and
not
a
breath
of
air
stirred
the
leaves
of
the
three
tall
trees
that
stood
at
the
edge
of
our
towering
rock
it
s
going
to
be
a
roasting
day
i
said
to
nux
and
we
won
t
get
any
shade
from
those
trees
until
afternoon
do
you
suppose
we
dare
go
down
to
the
cave
for
a
nux
shook
his
head
we
all
safe
now
mars
sam
he
replied
better
not
run
no
risk
wid
dis
yeah
gold
thoughtfully
i
gazed
toward
the
forest
those
fellows
will
be
cool
and
comfortable
enough
in
the
shade
i
remarked
rebelliously
and
i
don
t
believe
they
ll
come
back
through
the
hot
sun
until
it
s
time
to
get
the
treasure
let
s
go
down
to
the
sea
and
take
a
nux
was
unable
to
resist
the
temptation
so
leaving
the
trousers
full
of
golden
grains
resting
on
top
of
the
rock
we
made
our
way
cautiously
along
the
narrow
winding
ledge
until
we
reached
the
shore
there
was
not
a
ripple
on
the
sea
it
lay
as
still
and
inert
as
a
sheet
of
glass
but
the
water
was
cool
nevertheless
when
compared
with
the
stifling
atmosphere
and
so
i
and
my
black
companion
paddled
in
it
for
more
than
an
hour
feeling
much
refreshed
by
our
luxurious
bath
afterward
we
ate
our
simple
breakfast
and
then
climbed
the
ledge
as
far
as
the
mouth
of
the
cave
where
we
sat
down
in
the
shade
even
that
slight
exertion
quite
exhausted
us
we
will
be
sure
to
hear
them
if
they
should
by
chance
return
said
i
and
we
ll
certainly
be
roasted
if
we
get
on
top
of
this
rock
where
the
sun
can
strike
us
i
believe
it
s
the
hottest
day
i
ever
meantime
the
men
in
the
forest
were
finding
their
work
far
from
pleasant
as
bryonia
afterward
told
us
they
were
shaded
from
the
sun
it
is
true
but
the
air
they
breathed
was
as
hot
as
if
it
came
fresh
from
an
oven
and
the
least
exertion
caused
the
perspiration
to
stream
from
their
pores
so
there
was
considerable
grumbling
among
them
and
a
general
shirking
of
work
that
made
their
progress
slow
even
bryonia
who
was
fairly
found
he
had
little
energy
to
swing
his
axe
although
he
made
a
pretense
of
working
as
industriously
as
ever
never
mind
boys
said
daggett
when
noon
had
arrived
and
they
were
eating
the
luncheon
they
had
brought
in
their
pockets
the
raft
will
be
big
enough
to
carry
us
and
the
gold
to
the
ship
i
m
sure
for
the
sea
is
as
still
as
a
we
ll
just
get
these
two
logs
to
the
shore
and
fasten
them
to
the
others
and
call
the
thing
a
go
what
do
you
say
they
agreed
with
him
readily
enough
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
raft
might
suffice
to
carry
them
all
but
none
of
them
believed
that
all
five
would
embark
upon
it
so
many
murderous
schemes
were
lurking
in
their
minds
wearily
they
dragged
the
two
logs
toward
the
sea
but
much
time
was
consumed
in
this
operation
and
the
day
was
far
spent
before
the
raft
was
complete
and
ready
to
launch
most
of
the
men
had
stripped
themselves
naked
to
work
more
comfortably
for
the
heat
was
unbearable
but
now
as
they
stood
ready
to
push
the
raft
into
the
water
the
sun
suddenly
disappeared
and
a
cold
chill
swept
over
them
we
re
going
to
have
a
storm
cried
daggett
looking
curiously
into
the
sky
better
leave
the
raft
where
it
is
my
lads
and
make
for
the
the
warning
was
unquestionable
already
a
low
moaning
sound
came
to
their
ears
across
the
sea
and
the
sky
grew
darker
each
moment
with
one
accord
the
men
seized
their
clothing
in
their
arms
and
ran
along
the
beach
toward
the
cave
while
tiny
points
of
lightning
darted
here
and
there
about
them
casting
weird
if
momentary
gleams
upon
their
naked
forms
nux
and
i
sitting
half
asleep
by
the
mouth
of
the
cave
were
warned
by
the
first
chill
blast
that
swept
over
us
that
the
weather
had
changed
and
a
storm
was
imminent
springing
to
my
feet
i
looked
fearfully
at
the
darkening
sky
what
ll
we
do
nux
i
asked
this
will
bring
our
enemies
back
here
in
better
climb
on
top
de
rock
mars
sam
advised
the
sulu
but
it
ll
and
torrents
thunder
and
lightning
spect
it
will
mars
sam
but
rain
wont
hurt
us
and
daggett
s
gang
will
if
they
catch
us
i
guess
you
re
right
nux
come
as
we
started
along
the
ledge
the
wind
came
upon
us
in
sudden
gusts
and
the
sky
grew
so
dark
that
we
almost
had
to
feel
our
way
it
was
necessary
to
exercise
great
care
both
to
find
a
secure
footing
and
to
cling
fast
to
the
face
of
the
rock
to
prevent
our
being
blown
into
the
abyss
below
but
we
struggled
manfully
on
and
presently
reached
the
top
where
nux
hoisted
me
over
the
edge
and
then
scrambled
after
me
by
this
time
the
lightning
was
playing
all
around
us
and
we
were
obliged
to
crawl
carefully
on
hands
and
knees
to
the
little
hollow
in
the
center
of
the
rock
where
we
were
to
an
extent
shielded
from
the
fierce
gusts
of
wind
even
then
i
feared
we
would
be
blown
away
but
nux
shouted
in
my
ear
to
hold
fast
to
the
gold
which
served
as
a
sort
of
anchor
and
enabled
us
both
as
we
lay
flat
in
the
hollow
to
maintain
our
positions
securely
and
now
the
lightning
began
to
be
accompanied
by
sharp
peals
of
thunder
while
the
wind
suddenly
subsided
to
give
place
to
wild
floods
of
rain
at
intervals
could
be
heard
the
shouts
of
the
robbers
who
had
reached
the
rocks
and
were
creeping
along
the
ledge
to
their
cave
all
the
elements
seemed
engaged
in
a
confused
turmoil
until
i
was
nearly
deafened
by
the
uproar
i
tried
to
ask
a
question
of
nux
but
could
not
hear
my
own
voice
and
gave
up
the
attempt
the
thought
crossed
my
mind
that
we
had
been
very
foolish
to
climb
to
this
peak
of
rock
where
we
were
exposed
to
the
full
fury
of
the
storm
and
i
wondered
vaguely
as
i
clung
to
the
sack
of
gold
we
had
risked
so
much
to
secure
how
long
it
would
be
before
the
wind
swept
us
away
or
we
would
be
annihilated
by
a
bolt
of
lightning
presently
an
arm
was
laid
across
my
back
as
if
to
protect
me
and
raising
my
head
i
saw
by
the
light
of
a
vivid
flash
that
bryonia
had
joined
us
and
was
lying
in
the
hollow
at
my
side
i
wondered
how
the
daring
sulu
had
ever
managed
to
reach
us
but
the
strong
arm
gave
me
a
new
sense
of
security
and
impulsively
i
seized
the
black
man
s
hand
and
pressed
it
to
express
my
gratitude
and
welcome
an
instant
later
a
terrible
crash
sounded
in
my
ears
while
at
the
same
time
a
blast
of
fire
swept
over
the
rock
and
seemed
to
bathe
our
three
prostrate
figures
in
its
withering
flame
again
came
a
crash
and
still
another
while
the
crisp
lightning
darted
through
the
air
and
made
each
nerve
of
our
bodies
tingle
as
if
pricked
by
myriads
of
needle
points
half
bewildered
i
raised
my
head
and
saw
the
great
sway
from
side
to
side
and
then
plunge
headlong
into
the
gulf
that
lay
between
the
precipice
and
the
solitary
rock
whereon
we
reclined
and
i
felt
the
mighty
column
of
rock
shake
and
lean
outward
as
if
about
to
topple
into
the
sea
while
the
impact
of
the
fallen
mass
reverberated
above
the
shriek
of
the
wind
and
the
thunder
s
loudest
roar
instinctively
i
braced
myself
for
the
seemingly
inevitable
outcome
of
this
terrible
catastrophe
but
to
my
surprise
no
violent
calamity
overwhelmed
us
instead
the
lightning
as
if
satisfied
with
its
work
of
destruction
gradually
abated
the
blinding
flashes
no
longer
pained
my
closed
eyes
with
their
vivid
recurrence
and
even
the
wind
and
rain
moderated
and
grew
less
violent
chapter
xiv
buried
alive
terrified
beyond
measure
by
the
awfulness
of
the
storm
i
gave
little
heed
to
the
fact
that
the
rocky
hollow
in
which
i
lay
with
the
two
faithful
blacks
had
filled
with
water
so
that
our
bodies
were
nearly
covered
by
the
pool
that
had
formed
my
head
still
rested
on
the
trousers
packed
with
gold
and
one
arm
was
closely
clasped
around
a
leg
containing
the
treasured
metal
grains
so
i
lay
half
dazed
and
scarcely
daring
to
move
while
the
rain
pattered
down
upon
us
and
the
storm
sobbed
itself
out
by
degrees
i
must
have
lost
consciousness
after
a
time
for
my
first
distinct
recollection
is
of
bryonia
drawing
my
body
from
the
pool
to
lay
it
on
a
dryer
portion
of
the
rock
where
the
overhanging
trees
slightly
sheltered
me
the
sky
had
grown
lighter
by
now
and
while
black
streaks
of
cloud
still
drifted
swiftly
across
the
face
of
the
moon
there
were
times
when
the
great
disc
was
clear
and
shed
its
light
brilliantly
over
the
bleak
and
desolate
landscape
within
an
hour
the
rain
had
ceased
altogether
and
stars
came
out
to
join
the
moon
but
still
we
lay
motionless
atop
the
peak
of
rock
worn
out
by
our
struggles
with
the
elements
and
fitfully
dozing
in
spite
of
the
horrors
we
had
passed
through
bry
was
first
to
arouse
and
found
the
sun
shining
overhead
there
was
no
wind
and
the
temperature
of
the
morning
air
was
warm
and
genial
the
black
s
legs
pained
him
for
in
his
terrible
climb
up
the
rock
during
the
storm
a
jagged
piece
of
rock
had
cut
his
thigh
and
torn
the
flesh
badly
he
had
not
noticed
it
until
now
but
after
examining
the
wound
he
bathed
it
in
the
water
of
the
pool
and
bound
it
up
with
a
rag
torn
from
his
shirt
while
he
was
thus
occupied
nux
sat
up
and
watched
him
yawning
they
spoke
together
in
low
tones
using
the
expressive
sulu
language
and
had
soon
acquainted
each
other
with
the
events
that
had
occurred
since
they
separated
their
murmured
words
aroused
me
to
a
realization
of
the
present
and
having
partially
collected
my
thoughts
i
began
to
rub
my
eyes
and
look
wonderingly
around
me
the
top
of
the
rock
was
no
longer
flat
but
inclined
toward
the
sea
the
three
tall
trees
also
inclined
that
way
instead
of
growing
upright
and
the
neighboring
cliff
of
the
mainland
seemed
further
removed
from
us
than
before
something
appeared
to
be
missing
in
the
landscape
and
then
i
suddenly
remembered
how
the
had
leaped
into
the
gulf
during
the
storm
all
safe
i
asked
looking
at
my
black
friends
gratefully
all
safe
answered
bry
smiling
it
was
a
dreadful
night
i
continued
with
a
shudder
have
you
heard
anything
from
the
robbers
yet
no
mars
they
re
probably
sleeping
late
anyhow
they
can
t
have
gone
away
on
the
raft
bry
shook
his
head
all
very
wicked
mans
mars
sam
he
said
even
in
big
storm
while
we
climb
up
to
cave
mars
daggett
tell
me
to
go
behind
pete
an
push
him
off
the
villain
i
exclaimed
indignantly
he
tell
me
if
i
not
push
pete
off
he
kill
me
continued
bry
with
a
grin
what
did
you
do
when
they
run
into
cave
i
run
by
it
an
come
here
that
s
all
mars
you
did
well
bry
if
they
climb
up
here
after
you
we
ll
fight
them
to
the
no
climb
rock
any
more
mars
sam
said
bry
soberly
why
not
see
how
rock
tip
only
fly
can
climb
rock
i
believe
you
re
right
bry
i
cried
startled
at
this
dreadful
assertion
and
if
so
we
re
prisoners
here
let
us
see
what
it
looks
i
crawled
rather
stiffly
down
the
inclined
surface
to
the
edge
overlooking
the
sea
and
one
glance
showed
me
that
it
would
now
be
impossible
for
anyone
to
walk
along
the
narrow
ledge
while
i
looked
a
sharp
cry
of
horror
from
nux
reached
my
ears
and
swiftly
turning
i
hastened
with
bry
toward
the
place
where
the
black
was
leaning
over
the
gulf
that
separated
the
peak
from
the
mainland
what
is
it
nux
i
asked
anxiously
but
the
sulu
only
stood
motionless
pointing
with
one
finger
into
the
abyss
while
his
eyes
stared
downward
with
an
expression
of
abject
fear
we
both
followed
his
gaze
and
one
glance
was
sufficient
to
fully
acquaint
us
with
the
awful
catastrophe
the
vengeance
of
the
storm
had
wrought
the
huge
weighing
thousands
of
tons
which
for
ages
had
remained
delicately
balanced
upon
the
edge
of
the
chasm
had
been
struck
by
a
bolt
of
lightning
and
torn
from
its
base
crashing
into
the
gulf
a
point
of
the
great
boulder
had
entered
the
mouth
of
the
cave
where
the
desperadoes
sought
shelter
and
crowded
forward
by
its
own
weight
it
had
sealed
up
the
robbers
in
a
living
grave
from
whence
no
power
of
man
could
ever
rescue
them
it
was
this
mighty
wedge
crowded
into
the
space
between
the
slender
peak
and
the
main
cliff
that
had
caused
the
former
to
lean
outward
and
in
one
comprehensive
look
we
were
able
to
read
the
whole
story
of
the
night
s
tragedy
we
had
instinctively
felt
in
the
crash
of
the
storm
but
could
only
realize
now
poor
fellows
i
whispered
softly
forgetting
in
my
awe
that
they
had
been
our
relentless
enemies
it
was
a
terrible
fate
perhaps
they
re
even
now
sitting
in
that
dark
hole
shut
off
from
all
the
world
and
waiting
for
death
to
overtake
them
isn
t
it
the
blacks
glanced
at
one
another
without
reply
but
i
noticed
that
they
exchanged
a
secret
sign
which
their
pagan
priests
had
taught
them
when
they
were
boys
and
which
was
supposed
to
propitiate
the
demon
of
retribution
to
their
simple
minds
daggett
and
his
gang
of
had
been
properly
punished
for
their
wickedness
but
for
my
part
i
am
glad
to
remember
that
at
the
moment
i
ignored
the
fact
that
these
men
were
wicked
and
grieved
that
four
human
beings
had
suddenly
been
cut
off
in
the
prime
of
their
manhood
the
recollection
of
their
crimes
might
temper
my
regret
afterward
but
just
now
my
thoughts
were
all
of
sorrow
and
commiseration
nux
roused
me
from
my
reflections
by
asking
what
we
do
now
mars
sam
i
don
t
know
i
answered
despairingly
if
we
can
t
escape
from
this
rock
we
are
little
better
off
than
those
poor
fellows
below
us
see
the
stone
as
it
fell
tore
away
the
ledge
no
climb
down
any
way
at
all
said
bry
squatting
upon
the
rock
and
clasping
his
knees
with
his
hands
we
haven
t
any
rope
or
enough
clothing
to
make
one
i
continued
striving
to
be
calm
and
to
force
myself
to
think
clearly
but
if
we
remain
up
here
it
won
t
take
us
long
to
die
of
thirst
or
starvation
the
aggravating
thing
about
it
is
that
the
mainland
is
just
too
far
away
for
us
to
leap
across
to
it
we
re
in
a
bad
fix
boys
and
no
bry
gazed
reflectively
at
the
trees
if
we
had
axe
said
he
we
chop
down
tree
and
make
fall
across
the
ah
that
s
a
clever
idea
i
cried
but
my
elation
quickly
subsided
and
i
added
gloomily
in
the
next
breath
only
we
have
no
bry
made
no
answer
but
sat
thoughtfully
gazing
around
him
presently
he
began
to
creep
around
the
table
of
rock
on
his
hands
and
knees
examining
every
part
of
its
surface
with
great
care
at
one
place
where
the
edge
of
the
rock
was
jagged
and
of
a
harder
character
than
the
rest
he
paused
to
make
a
more
thorough
examination
and
then
he
drew
out
his
and
began
prying
into
the
rock
with
its
point
nux
and
i
immediately
crept
to
his
side
to
see
what
he
was
doing
and
soon
bry
had
loosened
a
piece
of
rock
that
weighed
about
five
pounds
it
was
flat
on
the
lower
surface
and
of
irregular
circular
form
this
fragment
the
sulu
examined
with
great
care
and
struck
it
sharply
against
the
rock
without
breaking
it
it
seemed
to
meet
his
approval
for
he
laid
it
carefully
aside
and
at
once
attempted
to
pry
up
another
portion
of
the
hard
rock
then
when
he
had
again
succeeded
he
sat
down
and
began
cautiously
chipping
one
piece
of
rock
against
the
other
until
he
had
brought
the
first
fragment
to
a
wedge
shape
that
resembled
a
rude
axe
ah
i
understand
now
what
you
re
about
bry
i
exclaimed
delightedly
do
you
think
you
can
make
it
work
bry
nodded
that
way
we
make
axe
in
he
said
proudly
he
now
handed
the
rude
implement
to
nux
who
seemed
to
comprehend
without
words
what
was
required
of
him
for
he
at
once
began
rubbing
the
edge
of
the
stone
axe
upon
a
rough
portion
of
rock
to
smooth
and
sharpen
it
more
perfectly
meanwhile
bry
pried
up
more
rock
and
formed
a
second
and
so
for
several
hours
the
men
labored
patiently
at
their
task
while
i
unable
to
be
of
assistance
sat
watching
them
with
breathless
interest
when
the
second
axe
was
ready
for
nux
to
sharpen
bry
climbed
up
the
trunk
of
one
of
the
tall
pines
and
selecting
a
branch
of
the
size
he
desired
with
much
effort
cut
it
from
the
tree
with
his
knife
then
he
descended
trimmed
the
branch
and
began
fashioning
it
into
an
he
made
no
attempt
to
render
it
graceful
or
beautiful
you
may
be
sure
the
one
requirement
was
service
and
the
wood
was
tough
and
strong
enough
to
answer
the
purpose
required
by
the
time
the
handle
was
ready
nux
had
worn
the
edge
of
the
first
rude
stone
axe
to
a
fair
degree
of
sharpness
and
with
it
bry
split
the
end
of
the
handle
far
enough
down
to
wedge
the
between
the
pieces
then
he
bound
the
top
together
with
strips
of
bark
cut
from
a
young
limb
which
was
far
stronger
than
any
cord
would
have
been
a
clumsy
instrument
it
seemed
to
be
when
it
was
finished
but
bry
balanced
it
gravely
in
his
hands
and
swung
it
around
his
head
and
nodded
his
full
approval
and
satisfaction
now
we
chop
down
tree
he
announced
of
the
three
trees
that
fortunately
grew
upon
the
column
of
rock
two
were
evidently
too
short
to
reach
across
the
gulf
from
where
they
stood
but
the
third
was
close
to
the
edge
and
towered
well
above
its
fellows
so
this
was
the
one
bry
selected
a
woodsman
would
probably
have
laughed
at
the
strokes
dealt
by
the
sulu
but
bry
knew
what
he
was
about
for
he
had
chopped
trees
in
this
way
before
too
hard
a
blow
would
have
crushed
the
stone
edge
of
the
weapon
and
a
prying
motion
would
have
broken
it
at
once
so
the
black
struck
straight
and
true
and
not
with
too
much
force
and
slowly
but
surely
wore
through
the
stalwart
trunk
of
the
tree
when
the
axe
got
dull
he
unbound
the
bark
thongs
and
exchanged
it
for
the
other
while
nux
it
this
consumed
a
good
deal
of
time
and
the
day
was
far
advanced
before
bry
decided
that
the
chopping
was
deep
enough
to
allow
them
to
fell
the
tree
this
they
did
in
a
peculiar
way
for
nux
climbed
into
the
high
branches
and
then
aided
by
bry
and
me
who
pushed
from
below
he
began
swaying
the
tree
back
and
forth
his
own
weight
adding
to
the
strain
until
suddenly
it
gave
way
at
the
stump
at
first
but
with
ever
accelerating
with
a
crash
across
the
gulf
it
looked
like
a
trying
and
dangerous
position
for
nux
but
the
black
cleverly
kept
on
the
outer
side
of
the
branches
which
broke
his
fall
so
perfectly
that
even
as
the
tree
touched
the
cliff
he
sprang
to
the
ground
safe
and
uninjured
hooray
i
shouted
in
delight
for
this
bridge
removed
from
my
heart
all
terrors
of
starvation
and
imprisonment
affording
us
a
means
of
leaving
the
islet
of
rock
as
soon
as
we
pleased
to
go
but
the
sun
was
even
now
sinking
below
the
horizon
so
we
decided
not
to
effect
the
crossing
until
morning
nux
climbed
back
over
the
swaying
trunk
and
after
he
had
rejoined
us
we
ate
the
last
crumbs
of
food
we
possessed
for
our
supper
and
then
lay
down
to
sleep
having
passed
the
day
in
idleness
i
found
i
was
not
very
tired
or
sleepy
but
the
blacks
were
thoroughly
exhausted
by
their
labors
and
they
welcomed
the
rest
as
only
weary
men
can
long
after
they
were
snoring
i
sat
in
the
moonlight
thinking
of
our
strange
adventures
of
the
past
hours
the
recovery
of
the
gold
the
destruction
of
the
robbers
and
our
present
means
of
release
from
the
dangerous
pinnacle
that
had
threatened
to
hold
us
fast
prisoners
and
i
realized
with
a
grateful
heart
that
i
owed
all
of
my
good
fortune
and
narrow
escapes
to
the
faithful
black
men
and
made
a
vow
that
i
would
never
in
the
future
forget
the
services
they
had
rendered
chapter
xv
the
major
gives
chase
meantime
there
had
been
much
excitement
and
confusion
in
the
camp
when
it
was
discovered
that
several
of
the
men
including
nux
and
bry
and
even
the
boy
sam
had
disappeared
during
the
night
with
most
of
the
gold
dust
that
had
been
accumulated
i
can
relate
fairly
well
what
occurred
for
i
heard
the
story
often
enough
afterward
the
major
was
furious
with
rage
at
first
and
sent
at
once
for
uncle
naboth
whom
he
accused
of
being
at
the
bottom
of
the
plot
to
rob
him
perkins
was
so
full
of
his
own
anxieties
that
he
paid
little
attention
to
the
giant
s
ravings
i
m
afraid
sam
s
in
trouble
he
said
nervously
in
trouble
you
bet
he
is
yelled
the
major
i
ll
skin
him
alive
when
i
catch
that
s
the
point
answered
uncle
naboth
how
are
we
to
find
him
again
i
ll
risk
your
hurting
the
boy
if
we
can
only
find
out
where
they
ve
taken
your
niggers
are
gone
too
the
major
reminded
him
that
s
the
only
thing
that
gives
me
hope
sir
retorted
my
uncle
those
black
men
are
as
faithful
and
honest
as
any
men
on
earth
and
i
m
thinking
they
re
gone
after
sam
to
try
to
rescue
then
you
think
he
s
been
kidnapped
do
you
of
course
the
men
that
are
missing
are
the
worst
of
your
ones
that
have
caused
you
the
most
trouble
in
every
way
there
s
not
a
man
from
the
flipper
s
crew
among
them
the
way
i
figure
it
out
is
that
daggett
larkin
hayes
and
judson
have
made
a
plot
to
steal
all
the
gold
and
escape
with
it
they
robbed
you
first
and
then
they
robbed
sam
and
when
the
boy
tried
to
make
a
fuss
they
just
kidnapped
him
and
took
him
along
with
how
about
the
niggers
asked
the
major
sarcastically
that
puzzles
me
i
ll
admit
acknowledged
my
uncle
bry
and
nux
may
have
seen
the
thieves
get
away
with
sam
and
followed
after
them
to
try
to
rescue
him
that
s
the
only
way
i
can
figure
it
out
just
now
but
we
re
losing
time
major
what
s
to
be
done
two
things
get
back
the
gold
and
shoot
down
the
robbers
like
dogs
they
can
t
get
away
you
know
they
re
somewhere
on
this
island
and
i
mean
to
find
there
s
the
what
of
it
if
they
get
aboard
and
sail
away
we
ll
be
in
a
bad
how
can
they
get
aboard
we
ve
got
the
small
they
can
make
a
raft
or
even
swim
out
to
the
ship
returned
uncle
naboth
shrewdly
i
tell
you
major
you
re
wasting
time
why
don
t
you
do
something
the
major
glanced
at
him
as
if
undecided
whether
to
be
angry
with
him
or
not
but
perkins
was
undoubtedly
right
and
the
miners
were
gathering
outside
the
door
with
curses
and
threats
against
the
men
who
had
robbed
them
for
the
news
had
quickly
spread
throughout
the
camp
so
their
leader
sent
six
men
heavily
armed
in
the
ship
s
to
board
the
flipper
and
protect
the
vessel
from
being
captured
these
were
all
his
own
men
for
he
still
suspected
that
the
flipper
s
crew
were
in
some
way
implicated
in
the
theft
then
he
picked
four
miners
and
four
of
the
sailors
to
form
a
party
to
search
for
the
robbers
and
decided
to
lead
the
band
himself
and
to
take
uncle
naboth
with
him
the
rest
of
the
men
were
ordered
to
resume
their
work
of
washing
out
gold
i
m
going
to
trust
you
perkins
said
the
major
for
your
loss
is
as
great
as
ours
and
you
seem
anxious
over
that
boy
of
yours
but
if
i
meet
with
any
treachery
i
ll
shoot
you
on
the
spot
and
if
i
find
that
sam
steele
is
one
of
the
thieves
i
ll
show
him
no
mercy
i
promise
quite
satisfactory
sir
answered
uncle
naboth
calmly
only
let
us
get
started
as
soon
as
it
was
a
puzzle
at
first
to
know
in
which
direction
to
look
for
the
fugitives
but
ned
britton
had
been
carefully
inspecting
the
edge
of
the
forest
and
came
upon
one
of
the
paths
daggett
had
made
in
the
course
of
his
various
wanderings
inland
it
was
not
the
one
we
had
taken
but
away
they
started
through
the
thicket
on
a
false
scent
and
the
entire
day
was
consumed
in
a
vain
search
as
they
sat
over
their
camp
fire
at
evening
ned
proposed
that
they
try
the
other
side
of
the
island
the
following
day
it
s
there
where
the
ship
lies
anchored
sir
he
told
the
major
and
it
s
most
likely
the
men
are
in
that
neighborhood
the
paths
we
ve
been
following
today
are
old
trails
that
lead
nowhere
in
particular
and
there
s
no
use
going
any
further
in
this
this
proposition
was
so
sensible
that
the
major
at
once
agreed
to
it
and
daybreak
saw
them
tramping
through
the
tangled
underbrush
toward
the
opposite
side
of
the
island
britton
who
had
a
good
sense
of
direction
and
knew
about
where
the
ship
lay
undertook
to
guide
them
and
was
fortunate
enough
to
strike
the
trail
of
the
robbers
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
the
tracks
lay
directly
toward
the
beach
and
they
pressed
on
with
renewed
vigor
but
the
heat
was
terribly
oppressive
in
the
more
open
country
they
had
now
reached
and
the
men
were
all
exhausted
by
the
long
tramp
when
a
little
later
the
sky
grew
black
and
the
storm
burst
upon
them
they
withdrew
to
a
thick
grove
of
trees
and
rigged
up
a
temporary
shelter
with
their
blankets
beneath
which
they
passed
the
night
the
storm
raged
all
around
them
and
occasionally
the
crash
of
a
fallen
tree
startled
their
nerves
but
the
high
cliff
broke
the
force
of
the
wind
and
the
lightning
was
less
severe
than
it
was
directly
on
the
coast
uncle
naboth
thought
of
me
more
than
once
during
this
rage
of
the
elements
and
hoped
i
was
safe
from
harm
indeed
his
anxiety
was
so
great
that
he
scarcely
closed
his
eyes
throughout
the
night
at
daybreak
they
left
their
shelter
and
gazed
wonderingly
at
the
scene
of
devastation
around
them
the
storm
had
wrought
fearful
havoc
everywhere
and
when
they
resumed
their
journey
their
progress
was
necessarily
slow
and
difficult
still
they
labored
on
and
in
the
afternoon
passed
through
the
forest
and
came
upon
the
coast
directly
opposite
the
place
where
the
flipper
still
rode
at
anchor
under
bare
masts
she
seemed
to
have
escaped
all
danger
from
the
storm
and
although
the
sea
was
still
rolling
high
the
good
ship
nodded
her
prow
to
each
wave
with
a
grace
that
betokened
she
was
still
in
good
condition
well
boys
the
robbers
haven
t
got
her
yet
cried
uncle
naboth
delightedly
no
but
they
ve
had
a
try
for
it
already
said
the
major
significantly
as
he
pointed
to
a
raft
that
had
been
lifted
high
by
the
waves
of
the
previous
night
and
wedged
fast
between
two
great
trees
evidently
the
scoundrels
don
t
know
we
have
sent
a
squad
to
guard
the
we
re
on
their
trail
all
right
remarked
ned
britton
after
examining
the
crudely
constructed
raft
carefully
but
where
do
you
suppose
they
are
somewhere
on
the
coast
of
course
said
uncle
naboth
let
s
walk
up
the
edge
of
the
bay
to
the
inlet
and
see
if
they
re
in
that
so
they
made
for
the
inlet
failing
of
course
to
find
any
traces
of
the
thieves
they
were
seen
from
the
deck
of
the
flipper
by
the
men
who
had
been
sent
aboard
in
the
long
boat
and
the
major
signaled
them
to
remain
where
they
were
for
the
present
after
a
brief
halt
the
little
band
retraced
their
steps
to
examine
the
coast
in
the
other
direction
and
another
night
overtook
them
within
hailing
distance
of
the
rocky
peak
where
i
and
my
two
blacks
were
resting
beside
our
newly
acquired
bridge
to
await
impatiently
the
morning
but
the
major
s
party
was
of
course
unaware
of
this
and
went
into
camp
in
a
hollow
where
the
light
of
their
fire
was
unobserved
by
us
at
daybreak
however
uncle
naboth
and
ned
britton
were
up
and
anxiously
exploring
the
coast
and
presently
they
saw
a
little
distance
away
the
tall
form
of
bryonia
walking
carefully
across
our
tree
trunk
the
black
almost
fell
into
the
arms
of
uncle
naboth
as
he
stepped
off
the
tree
and
the
old
man
s
first
anxious
question
was
where
s
sam
here
i
am
uncle
i
called
from
my
rock
i
ll
be
with
you
in
a
minute
but
we
ve
got
to
get
the
gold
over
the
gold
cried
uncle
naboth
in
amazement
have
you
got
it
then
after
all
to
be
sure
said
i
with
a
touch
of
pride
every
grain
of
it
uncle
naboth
groaned
i
didn
t
think
as
you
d
do
it
sam
my
boy
he
said
regretfully
i
couldn
t
have
done
it
without
nux
and
bry
i
answered
not
understanding
that
i
had
been
accused
of
the
theft
the
old
man
turned
reproachfully
to
bry
who
stood
grinning
beside
him
did
i
ever
teach
you
to
steal
sir
he
demanded
sternly
takin
gold
from
robbers
ain
t
stealin
replied
the
black
in
a
calm
tone
what
robbers
daggett
an
pete
an
oh
i
see
exclaimed
uncle
naboth
a
light
breaking
in
upon
his
confused
mind
they
stole
the
gold
from
the
camp
i
suppose
and
you
and
sam
have
followed
them
up
and
got
it
back
again
that
s
it
exactly
uncle
i
declared
from
my
side
of
the
precipice
where
i
could
hear
every
word
spoken
i
ll
tell
you
the
whole
story
bye
and
just
then
i
was
wondering
if
i
dared
cross
the
tree
it
seemed
very
frail
and
the
rounded
trunk
was
difficult
to
walk
upon
should
i
lose
my
balance
there
were
only
a
few
slender
branches
to
cling
to
in
order
to
keep
from
toppling
over
into
the
gulf
below
bry
saw
my
dilemma
however
and
running
lightly
across
the
tree
again
he
caught
me
up
bodily
and
perched
me
upon
his
broad
shoulders
hold
fast
mars
sam
he
called
and
the
next
moment
stepped
out
fearlessly
and
while
uncle
naboth
held
his
breath
in
grim
suspense
the
black
crossed
the
swaying
tree
and
dropped
me
safely
on
the
other
side
the
old
man
had
barely
time
to
grasp
both
my
hands
in
a
warm
clasp
when
the
big
major
came
up
blowing
and
sputtering
with
the
balance
of
the
party
well
where
s
the
rest
o
the
thieves
he
cried
out
glaring
fiercely
at
me
and
then
at
bry
under
that
rock
sir
i
answered
gravely
with
a
shudder
at
the
recollection
of
their
dreadful
punishment
and
then
in
as
few
words
as
possible
i
told
the
story
of
our
adventures
relating
how
we
had
followed
the
robbers
and
recovered
the
gold
and
of
the
great
storm
that
had
sent
the
hurling
into
the
chasm
to
seal
up
the
evil
band
in
a
living
tomb
even
the
major
was
impressed
by
the
weird
tale
and
uncle
naboth
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
brow
as
he
leaned
over
the
cliff
and
marked
the
immense
wedge
of
rock
that
had
closed
forever
the
mouth
of
the
cavern
it
seems
there
s
no
one
left
to
punish
growled
the
in
a
low
voice
and
i
m
glad
the
fate
of
those
scoundrels
was
taken
out
of
my
hands
as
for
you
young
man
turning
suddenly
to
me
you
ve
acted
splendidly
an
so
have
the
niggers
let
s
shake
hands
all
round
i
felt
my
face
turn
as
red
as
the
major
s
whiskers
at
this
unexpected
praise
hooray
yelled
ned
britton
and
the
others
joined
him
in
a
mighty
shout
of
approval
then
ned
and
bry
crossed
the
tree
to
where
nux
was
still
standing
on
the
peak
and
hoisted
the
loaded
trousers
to
bryonia
s
back
nux
crossed
over
in
front
and
ned
britton
behind
the
bearer
of
the
precious
gold
to
save
him
if
he
made
a
misstep
but
their
caution
was
unnecessary
the
big
sulu
was
as
as
a
goat
and
safely
deposited
his
burden
at
the
major
s
feet
then
we
all
returned
to
the
camp
for
breakfast
after
which
the
gold
being
taken
from
the
trousers
and
distributed
into
several
small
packages
that
they
might
be
more
easily
carried
nux
was
given
his
again
to
his
infinite
satisfaction
and
now
said
the
major
we
ll
make
tracks
for
the
camp
we
ve
been
away
a
long
time
but
we
ve
got
the
gold
back
and
got
rid
of
the
worst
characters
among
the
lot
of
us
so
there
s
nothing
much
to
grumble
over
after
chapter
xvi
the
grave
captain
gay
perhaps
it
was
only
natural
that
i
should
become
the
hero
of
the
miners
when
the
camp
was
at
last
reached
and
the
men
learned
the
strange
story
of
our
recovery
of
the
gold
nux
and
bry
also
came
in
for
a
good
share
of
praise
which
they
well
deserved
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
adventure
had
established
a
permanent
good
feeling
between
the
gold
seekers
and
our
crew
of
the
there
was
no
more
suspicion
on
either
side
and
when
the
major
made
a
new
division
of
the
recovered
gold
he
generously
insisted
that
i
should
receive
even
more
than
i
had
been
robbed
of
for
my
share
whatever
the
major
s
faults
might
be
he
was
certainly
liberal
in
his
dealings
with
others
and
uncle
naboth
was
greatly
pleased
with
the
profitable
result
of
an
adventure
that
had
at
first
threatened
to
ruin
the
fortunes
of
the
firm
of
perkins
steele
no
one
mourned
very
much
over
the
death
of
the
men
who
had
stolen
the
gold
on
the
contrary
there
was
a
feeling
of
general
relief
that
the
four
desperadoes
were
unable
to
cause
any
more
trouble
therefore
the
camp
resumed
its
former
routine
and
the
miners
set
to
work
with
renewed
vigor
to
wash
out
the
golden
grains
from
the
rich
sands
of
the
inlet
it
was
about
this
time
that
the
grave
and
reserved
captain
gay
proved
himself
to
be
a
genius
and
by
an
act
of
real
cleverness
that
crowned
his
name
with
glory
materially
shortened
the
stay
of
our
entire
community
on
the
island
the
captain
had
worked
side
by
side
with
the
common
sailors
for
the
major
showed
no
favoritism
and
insisted
that
every
man
should
perform
his
share
of
the
work
even
uncle
naboth
had
from
the
first
day
of
our
capture
toiled
from
morning
till
night
but
he
accepted
his
tasks
with
rare
good
nature
and
frequently
confided
to
me
in
his
droll
way
that
his
enforced
labor
had
added
ten
years
to
his
life
i
was
gettin
altogether
too
chunked
and
fat
he
said
one
evening
and
likely
enough
i
d
a
been
troubled
sooner
or
later
with
apoplexy
or
dropsical
but
now
i
ve
lost
twenty
or
thirty
pounds
weight
an
feel
as
lively
as
a
cricket
in
a
hornet
s
nest
work
s
a
good
thing
sam
i
m
glad
the
major
made
me
do
it
probably
he
s
saved
my
life
by
his
captain
gay
had
been
working
at
the
upper
end
of
the
inlet
near
to
the
place
where
a
slender
mountain
stream
fell
from
a
precipice
above
and
mingled
its
fresh
water
with
that
of
the
inlet
this
stream
fell
upon
a
rocky
bottom
but
in
course
of
years
it
had
worn
a
hollow
in
the
rock
which
could
be
distinctly
observed
through
the
transparent
water
there
ought
to
be
a
lot
of
gold
in
that
hollow
ned
britton
had
remarked
to
the
captain
one
day
i
ve
an
idea
all
the
gold
we
find
in
the
sands
of
the
inlet
has
been
brought
here
by
the
mountain
i
ve
been
thinking
that
myself
answered
the
captain
but
it
was
a
week
later
that
he
climbed
the
rock
and
followed
the
bent
of
the
stream
for
nearly
a
mile
marking
carefully
the
lay
of
the
land
the
next
morning
he
went
to
the
major
with
his
plan
which
was
nothing
less
than
a
proposal
to
turn
the
stream
from
its
bed
several
hundred
yards
above
and
let
it
follow
a
new
course
and
reach
the
inlet
a
hundred
feet
distant
from
its
present
fall
the
major
stared
thoughtfully
at
the
captain
for
a
time
and
then
followed
him
up
the
stream
and
made
a
careful
examination
of
the
territory
the
result
was
an
order
for
all
the
seamen
of
the
flipper
to
place
themselves
at
the
disposal
of
captain
gay
and
obey
his
orders
in
three
days
they
had
built
a
dam
of
rocks
and
brushwood
nearly
across
the
stream
and
pried
away
the
banks
in
another
place
to
allow
the
water
to
escape
by
the
new
channel
the
fourth
day
the
opening
was
closed
in
the
dam
and
the
stream
plunged
away
on
its
new
course
leaving
its
former
bed
practically
dry
immediately
the
men
ran
down
to
the
inlet
where
the
major
himself
waded
to
the
hollow
caused
by
the
previous
fall
of
water
and
dipped
a
pan
of
sand
from
the
cavity
upon
examination
it
proved
richer
in
gold
than
any
of
us
had
anticipated
the
sands
containing
many
small
nuggets
which
being
heavier
than
the
grains
of
metal
had
been
accumulating
for
many
years
in
the
basin
all
hands
were
set
to
work
in
this
locality
and
inspired
by
the
rich
harvest
that
rewarded
their
toil
they
labored
early
and
late
until
the
bags
of
dust
and
nuggets
had
become
so
numerous
that
even
the
major
was
filled
with
amazement
but
this
was
not
all
that
was
gained
by
turning
the
mountain
stream
from
its
bed
in
several
hollows
up
above
captain
gay
discovered
rich
deposits
of
small
nuggets
that
were
secured
with
ease
and
two
weeks
later
the
major
called
a
meeting
of
all
the
members
of
the
party
on
the
sands
before
his
tent
boys
said
he
we
ve
got
enough
to
make
every
one
of
us
rich
for
life
what
s
the
use
of
staying
here
longer
i
m
getting
homesick
for
one
and
a
good
many
of
you
are
longing
to
get
back
to
the
states
and
begin
spending
your
piles
what
do
you
we
board
the
ship
and
go
home
yes
they
yelled
without
a
dissenting
voice
then
said
the
major
tomorrow
we
ll
divide
the
spoils
so
that
every
man
has
his
honest
share
and
then
we
ll
pay
our
passage
money
to
perkins
and
sail
away
the
division
was
accomplished
with
very
little
dissatisfaction
or
friction
for
the
worst
elements
in
our
assorted
company
had
been
removed
and
the
major
was
absolutely
just
in
his
decisions
one
or
two
to
be
sure
grumbled
that
the
provisions
from
the
flipper
had
been
purchased
at
too
high
a
price
or
that
too
much
of
the
gold
was
set
aside
to
pay
for
the
passage
back
to
san
francisco
but
not
one
objected
when
the
major
set
aside
three
heavy
bags
of
gold
to
reward
captain
gay
for
his
clever
feat
in
turning
the
mountain
stream
when
uncle
naboth
and
i
in
the
seclusion
of
my
hut
had
figured
out
our
share
of
the
profits
the
old
man
was
hugely
delighted
my
partner
he
exclaimed
slapping
his
thigh
with
enthusiasm
it
s
paid
us
better
than
three
trips
to
alaska
we
ve
nearly
made
our
fortunes
sam
my
boy
and
if
we
get
safe
home
again
we
can
thank
the
major
for
making
us
his
it
did
not
take
our
party
long
to
transfer
all
their
possessions
to
the
decks
of
the
flipper
where
the
ship
s
carpenter
and
part
of
the
crew
had
been
sent
beforehand
to
clear
up
the
rigging
ship
a
new
rudder
and
make
some
repairs
that
had
been
rendered
necessary
by
the
storm
that
had
driven
us
to
this
strange
island
to
my
own
inexperienced
eyes
the
damage
had
been
so
great
that
it
seemed
as
if
the
sailors
would
require
weeks
in
which
to
make
the
vessel
fit
to
put
to
sea
again
so
that
i
was
astonished
when
i
went
aboard
to
note
how
quickly
the
task
had
been
accomplished
indeed
the
flipper
seemed
as
trim
and
staunch
as
when
she
last
sailed
out
of
the
golden
gate
and
doubtless
she
was
fully
able
to
bear
us
all
safely
home
again
all
our
party
having
been
put
aboard
together
with
their
property
captain
gay
ordered
the
anchors
hoisted
and
at
eleven
o
clock
on
the
morning
of
september
the
flipper
headed
out
to
sea
before
a
fair
breeze
the
quarters
aft
had
been
given
up
to
the
miners
most
of
whom
were
obliged
to
swing
hammocks
in
the
cabin
the
mate
offered
his
little
room
to
the
major
and
bunked
with
the
sailors
in
the
forecastle
but
captain
gay
and
perkins
retained
their
own
rooms
and
so
did
i
in
order
to
watch
over
the
firm
s
gold
which
was
stowed
carefully
away
in
my
lockers
you
may
be
sure
i
was
glad
to
get
back
to
my
books
and
my
comfortable
bed
again
and
overjoyed
to
find
myself
on
the
way
to
a
more
civilized
land
as
the
ship
stood
out
to
sea
the
major
who
had
been
pacing
the
deck
with
a
thoughtful
brow
noticed
captain
gay
taking
his
bearings
with
the
aid
of
the
sextant
while
i
stood
by
observing
him
at
once
the
big
man
s
countenance
cleared
and
he
strode
over
to
us
and
anxiously
watched
the
captain
while
the
latter
made
notes
of
his
observations
several
of
the
miners
likewise
seemed
interested
but
it
was
evident
they
did
not
understand
in
the
least
what
the
captain
was
doing
no
sooner
however
had
captain
gay
returned
to
his
cabin
where
at
his
request
i
followed
him
than
the
major
knocked
for
admittance
and
being
invited
to
enter
he
cautiously
closed
the
door
after
him
and
said
you
ve
relieved
me
of
a
great
worry
captain
i
was
afraid
we
d
never
be
able
to
find
this
island
again
but
the
sextant
gives
you
the
latitude
and
longitude
doesn
t
it
captain
gay
nodded
and
looked
thoughtfully
out
of
his
little
window
at
the
fast
receding
island
that
island
s
mine
continued
the
major
in
a
stern
voice
and
i
shall
claim
it
until
some
one
else
proves
a
better
right
to
the
still
the
captain
made
no
reply
the
major
stared
at
him
as
though
he
had
just
discovered
the
man
does
any
one
else
aboard
know
how
to
use
those
instruments
he
finally
asked
no
one
answered
the
captain
briefly
then
the
secret
is
safe
with
us
resumed
the
major
i
ll
just
trouble
you
my
good
fellow
to
give
me
the
exact
latitude
and
longitude
of
the
island
i
ll
mark
them
down
in
my
come
to
me
tomorrow
noon
said
captain
gay
why
tomorrow
noon
with
a
sudden
frown
can
t
you
understand
don
t
you
know
it
requires
hours
to
figure
out
so
complicated
a
problem
oh
does
it
a
nod
well
i
ll
come
in
tomorrow
but
understand
not
a
word
of
the
true
reckoning
to
a
soul
on
board
not
even
to
perkins
or
the
boy
here
who
has
no
business
to
be
listening
to
this
conversation
and
had
better
forget
it
the
island
is
mine
captain
gay
sat
silent
merely
drumming
with
his
fingers
on
the
little
table
before
him
the
major
gave
him
another
curious
look
and
stalked
away
whistling
softly
to
himself
as
if
something
had
occurred
to
puzzle
him
indeed
the
captain
s
face
was
so
set
and
stern
that
it
made
me
uncomfortable
and
i
soon
left
him
and
returned
to
my
own
room
the
flipper
made
good
time
during
the
afternoon
and
before
darkness
fell
those
on
board
saw
the
island
where
they
had
labored
so
hard
and
endured
so
much
gradually
sink
into
the
sea
and
disappear
the
breeze
held
all
through
the
night
and
daybreak
found
the
sturdy
ship
plowing
steadily
onward
over
the
waste
of
gray
waters
the
sailors
had
fallen
into
their
usual
routine
and
performed
their
labors
with
mechanical
precision
while
the
miners
lay
around
the
deck
and
watched
them
with
the
interest
landsmen
usually
show
when
on
a
sailing
ship
at
the
stroke
of
twelve
i
saw
the
major
promptly
approach
the
captain
s
room
where
i
knew
the
seaman
was
busily
engaged
in
writing
wishing
to
learn
the
result
of
this
second
interview
i
crept
forward
and
without
hesitation
established
myself
beside
the
door
which
the
had
carelessly
left
ajar
i
even
ventured
to
peer
curiously
through
the
opening
but
neither
of
the
men
observed
my
intrusion
the
major
for
a
moment
stood
staring
with
the
same
wondering
gaze
he
had
bestowed
on
captain
gay
the
day
before
but
suddenly
his
face
brightened
and
he
said
by
jupiter
i
ve
struck
it
at
last
struck
what
asked
the
captain
looking
up
the
resemblance
that
bothered
me
you
re
the
living
image
of
that
man
daggett
who
caused
us
that
trouble
on
the
island
it
s
a
wonder
i
never
noticed
it
the
captain
flushed
but
said
nothing
no
relation
i
hope
queried
the
major
grinning
to
daggett
yes
the
scoundrel
who
stole
our
captain
gay
had
resumed
his
writing
but
said
lightly
as
if
the
matter
was
too
preposterous
to
be
treated
seriously
is
it
likely
sir
but
already
the
major
s
mind
had
turned
to
a
more
important
subject
i
ve
come
for
that
little
memorandum
what
memorandum
asked
the
captain
quietly
the
location
of
the
oh
i
can
t
give
it
to
you
said
the
other
when
you
left
this
room
yesterday
the
draft
from
the
open
door
caught
the
paper
i
had
made
my
figures
on
and
carried
it
out
of
the
window
so
the
record
is
illustration
leave
this
room
sir
lost
the
major
stared
at
him
in
amazement
absolutely
lost
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
don
t
know
where
that
island
is
demanded
the
major
fiercely
i
haven
t
the
slightest
idea
of
its
location
during
the
night
the
helmsman
altered
our
course
several
times
steering
by
the
stars
i
think
we
re
going
in
the
right
direction
but
i
can
tell
better
when
i
ve
taken
our
observations
for
today
unfortunately
however
that
won
t
help
us
to
locate
the
the
major
sat
down
heavily
on
a
chest
the
information
he
had
received
fairly
dazed
him
but
his
gaze
remained
firmly
fixed
on
the
captain
s
expressionless
face
after
a
time
he
gave
a
laugh
and
said
i
told
you
yesterday
that
island
was
mine
i
ll
take
that
back
it
s
and
mine
you
ll
share
it
with
me
captain
gay
i
m
it
is
still
yours
major
as
far
as
i
m
concerned
if
i
knew
its
location
i
would
tell
you
willingly
but
i
don
t
you
ll
have
to
find
your
property
the
major
sprang
up
with
an
oath
you
infernal
scoundrel
he
cried
do
you
think
i
ll
be
played
with
like
this
give
me
the
location
of
that
island
or
by
the
nine
great
gods
i
ll
kill
you
where
you
sit
leave
this
room
the
captain
was
angry
too
by
this
time
he
stood
erect
and
pointed
with
dignity
to
the
doorway
from
which
i
dodged
with
alacrity
i
command
this
ship
sir
he
said
and
here
my
will
is
law
i
ll
endure
no
browbeating
major
or
any
insolence
from
you
or
any
of
my
passengers
on
the
island
i
obeyed
you
here
you
will
obey
me
or
i
ll
lock
you
fast
in
your
cabin
leave
this
room
the
major
stood
irresolute
a
moment
then
sullenly
and
slowly
he
quit
the
cabin
and
returned
to
the
deck
even
to
my
wondering
but
immature
intellect
it
was
evident
that
captain
gay
had
won
the
battle
chapter
xvii
we
give
up
the
ship
the
flipper
made
good
time
and
sighted
the
oregon
coast
on
the
morning
of
the
fifth
day
from
there
she
followed
the
dim
outlines
of
the
distant
land
down
to
the
golden
gate
and
cast
anchor
safely
and
without
event
in
the
bay
of
san
francisco
the
major
had
been
sullen
and
during
the
entire
voyage
but
although
he
made
repeated
efforts
to
see
captain
gay
privately
and
renew
his
request
for
the
location
of
the
golden
island
that
officer
positively
refused
to
hold
any
further
communication
with
him
therefore
the
major
was
helpless
after
all
the
captain
might
be
speaking
the
entire
truth
and
if
so
all
argument
was
useless
threats
do
not
affect
a
man
of
his
temperament
and
beyond
threats
the
major
did
not
care
to
go
even
to
secure
the
information
he
wished
bribery
in
such
a
case
was
absurd
therefore
nothing
could
be
done
but
bear
the
disappointment
with
a
good
grace
the
major
s
fortune
was
for
the
present
ample
and
i
wondered
why
he
should
ever
care
to
visit
the
island
again
as
soon
as
the
anchors
were
dropped
the
miners
clamored
to
be
set
ashore
and
by
night
they
had
all
quitted
the
ship
and
established
themselves
in
lodgings
in
the
town
from
whence
they
at
once
flocked
to
the
bankers
and
began
to
turn
their
golden
grains
into
cash
uncle
naboth
and
i
remained
on
board
another
day
there
were
settlements
to
be
made
with
the
sailors
and
various
other
details
that
needed
attention
at
the
close
of
the
voyage
so
that
i
was
kept
busy
with
my
books
of
accounts
and
uncle
naboth
stood
constantly
at
my
elbow
to
give
me
the
necessary
instructions
we
both
longed
to
be
on
shore
again
however
so
as
soon
as
the
last
formalities
were
completed
we
put
our
heavy
sacks
of
gold
into
a
boat
and
carried
them
to
the
docks
from
whence
an
escort
of
our
trusty
sailors
accompanied
us
to
the
bank
wherein
perkins
was
accustomed
to
keep
his
deposits
so
many
ships
had
lately
returned
from
alaska
bearing
gold
from
the
mines
that
perkins
heavy
deposit
aroused
no
wonder
except
as
to
its
extent
and
the
banker
warmly
congratulated
him
upon
his
good
fortune
in
making
so
successful
a
voyage
both
uncle
naboth
and
i
remained
at
the
bank
until
every
sack
of
gold
had
been
carefully
weighed
and
sealed
and
the
proper
receipt
given
then
breathing
freely
for
the
first
time
since
the
gold
had
been
in
our
possession
we
repaired
to
my
uncle
s
former
lodging
house
where
perkins
was
warmly
welcomed
we
ll
have
the
best
dinner
tonight
the
establishment
can
set
up
sam
my
boy
said
the
old
man
rubbing
his
hands
gleefully
together
for
we
ve
got
to
celebrate
the
success
of
the
new
partnership
you
must
a
brought
the
firm
luck
my
lad
for
this
here
is
the
biggest
haul
i
ve
heard
of
since
i
ve
been
in
the
business
we
re
rich
as
punkins
how
much
do
you
suppose
we
re
worth
uncle
i
enquired
rather
curiously
i
can
t
tell
exactly
o
course
till
after
we
ve
got
the
quality
of
our
gold
properly
graded
and
put
it
on
the
market
but
my
opinion
is
we
re
at
least
fifty
thousand
dollars
to
the
as
much
as
that
i
exclaimed
greatly
elated
full
as
much
i
then
said
i
drawing
a
sigh
of
relief
i
can
pay
ranck
that
four
hundred
dollars
i
owe
her
for
my
uncle
naboth
made
a
wry
face
it
s
a
shame
to
throw
good
money
away
on
that
old
termagan
he
remarked
and
i
ve
no
doubt
she
s
been
overpaid
already
by
stealin
the
contents
o
cap
n
steele
s
chest
but
if
it
d
make
you
feel
easier
in
your
mind
sam
i
ll
fix
it
so
you
can
send
her
the
money
as
soon
as
you
thank
you
uncle
i
replied
gratefully
i
ll
never
be
happy
until
the
debt
is
off
my
shoulders
whether
she
s
entitled
to
the
money
or
not
i
promised
ranck
i
d
pay
the
debt
and
i
want
to
keep
my
an
so
you
shall
said
uncle
naboth
with
an
approving
nod
we
feasted
royally
at
dinner
and
afterward
uncle
naboth
took
me
to
the
theatre
where
we
sat
in
the
top
gallery
among
the
crowd
of
laborers
and
sailors
but
enjoyed
the
play
very
much
indeed
some
folks
who
had
just
banked
fifty
thousand
remarked
my
uncle
reflectively
would
want
to
sit
down
there
among
them
nabobs
in
a
seat
that
costs
a
dollar
perhaps
two
dollars
for
all
i
know
but
what
s
the
use
sam
do
they
hear
or
see
any
better
than
we
do
up
here
probably
not
i
answered
with
a
smile
then
we
re
getting
as
much
fun
for
our
quarter
as
they
get
for
a
dollar
declared
uncle
naboth
chuckling
an
tomorrow
mornin
we
ll
be
so
much
richer
an
nothin
lost
by
it
sam
the
secret
o
spendin
money
ain
t
in
puttin
on
airs
it
s
in
gettin
all
the
pleasure
out
of
a
nickel
that
the
nickel
will
buy
live
high
is
my
motto
but
do
it
economical
that
s
the
true
philosophy
o
next
morning
as
we
were
sitting
in
uncle
naboth
s
little
room
we
were
surprised
by
the
entrance
of
captain
gay
he
was
accompanied
by
two
of
the
sailors
from
the
flipper
bearing
in
their
arms
the
easily
recognized
canvas
sacks
of
gold
from
the
island
the
captain
motioned
his
men
to
place
the
sacks
upon
the
rickety
table
which
nearly
collapsed
beneath
the
weight
and
then
ordered
them
to
leave
the
room
when
they
were
gone
he
carefully
closed
the
door
and
turning
to
my
uncle
said
abruptly
there
sir
is
every
grain
of
gold
i
got
in
that
accursed
island
the
most
of
it
was
given
me
for
turning
the
bed
of
the
mountain
stream
as
you
will
no
more
than
you
deserved
sir
said
uncle
naboth
puffing
his
pipe
vigorously
it
ought
to
be
worth
a
good
deal
of
money
continued
the
captain
his
voice
faltering
slightly
twenty
thousand
at
least
in
my
judgment
said
uncle
naboth
eyeing
the
sacks
well
sir
announced
captain
gay
with
decision
i
want
to
exchange
this
gold
for
a
bill
of
sale
of
the
what
the
flipper
yes
uncle
naboth
winked
at
me
gravely
as
if
to
convey
the
suggestion
that
the
man
had
gone
crazy
cap
n
said
he
after
a
pause
i
don
t
mean
to
say
as
sam
and
i
won
t
sell
the
ship
if
you
d
like
to
buy
her
but
the
tub
is
old
and
has
seen
her
best
days
she
s
worth
about
six
thousand
dollars
all
told
and
not
a
penny
you
must
take
all
that
gold
or
nothing
what
do
you
mean
asked
my
uncle
in
amazement
captain
gay
sat
down
and
looked
thoughtfully
out
of
the
window
perhaps
i
must
take
you
into
my
confidence
he
remarked
in
his
slow
quiet
tones
although
at
first
i
had
thought
this
action
would
be
unnecessary
i
ve
an
idea
i
d
like
to
own
a
ship
myself
and
to
trade
in
a
small
way
between
here
and
and
the
golden
island
occasionally
eh
cap
n
returned
uncle
naboth
shrewdly
i
ve
heard
from
sam
here
how
you
lost
the
paper
containing
your
observations
but
i
suppose
you
could
find
the
place
again
if
you
wanted
captain
gay
flushed
a
deep
red
sir
he
answered
you
wrong
me
with
your
suspicions
i
shall
never
revisit
that
island
under
any
circumstances
nor
do
i
wish
anyone
else
to
do
so
that
is
the
true
explanation
of
why
i
lost
that
did
you
lose
it
i
threw
it
uncle
naboth
whistled
i
m
free
to
confess
sir
that
i
m
all
at
sea
he
said
the
captain
arose
and
paced
the
room
with
unusual
agitation
mr
perkins
said
he
i
once
had
an
older
brother
who
when
a
boy
robbed
my
father
and
ran
away
from
home
i
never
saw
him
again
until
we
reached
that
island
where
i
recognized
my
erring
brother
in
the
man
who
called
himself
uncle
naboth
scratched
a
match
and
relit
his
pipe
i
marked
the
resemblance
between
you
he
observed
but
i
thought
nothing
of
to
my
grief
i
saw
that
he
had
not
altered
his
course
for
the
better
resumed
the
captain
of
his
final
theft
of
the
gold
and
the
awful
judgment
that
overtook
him
and
his
fellows
you
are
well
aware
i
shall
never
forget
the
horror
of
those
days
sir
it
seems
to
me
that
that
isolated
unknown
island
is
my
brother
s
tomb
where
he
must
lie
until
the
call
of
the
last
judgment
i
do
not
wish
anyone
ever
to
visit
the
spot
again
if
i
can
help
that
s
nonsense
declared
uncle
naboth
coldly
perhaps
so
but
it
s
the
way
i
feel
that
s
why
i
don
t
wish
to
touch
the
gold
i
ll
take
the
ship
in
exchange
for
it
but
i
won
t
use
the
stuff
in
any
other
way
or
have
anything
more
to
do
with
you
re
foolish
said
uncle
naboth
with
a
sternness
quite
foreign
to
his
nature
but
if
you
really
want
to
give
away
a
matter
of
twenty
thousand
for
an
old
hulk
that
s
worth
about
six
i
ll
let
you
have
your
that
s
my
desire
sir
announced
our
visitor
meekly
well
then
we
ll
go
to
a
lawyer
and
draw
up
the
papers
sam
you
stay
here
and
look
after
the
gold
till
i
get
very
well
sir
i
replied
full
of
wonder
at
this
queer
business
transaction
together
they
left
the
room
and
it
was
an
hour
before
perkins
returned
i
signed
for
both
of
us
partner
he
said
briskly
an
the
flipper
s
now
the
sole
property
of
cap
n
gay
with
the
money
this
gold
will
bring
we
can
buy
a
ship
twice
as
good
as
the
old
one
in
which
with
good
luck
to
back
us
we
ought
to
make
many
a
prosperous
why
do
you
think
he
did
it
sir
i
enquired
musingly
it
s
just
one
of
two
things
replied
perkins
either
the
man
s
a
bit
cracked
as
i
ve
sometimes
suspected
and
really
feels
sentimental
about
his
brother
s
death
or
else
he
s
got
a
sly
scheme
to
make
trips
to
the
island
in
an
old
ship
that
won
t
attract
attention
and
bring
away
many
cargoes
of
gold
that
ain
t
so
unlikely
sam
no
one
will
remark
on
cap
n
gay
s
owning
the
old
ship
he
s
commanded
for
years
but
if
he
bought
a
new
one
and
started
out
for
the
island
he
might
be
watched
and
his
true
business
suspected
either
the
feller
s
mighty
deep
or
mighty
innocent
but
it
ain
t
our
business
to
decide
which
we
ve
got
the
money
and
now
we
ll
look
for
a
newer
and
finer
new
england
s
the
best
place
to
buy
a
good
ship
sir
i
ve
often
heard
my
father
say
so
i
suggested
then
let
s
go
to
new
england
returned
uncle
naboth
promptly
we
ll
travel
together
and
you
can
run
up
to
batteraft
and
pay
the
old
hag
that
i
d
like
to
do
that
said
i
greatly
pleased
it
would
do
me
good
to
see
her
surprise
when
she
finds
i
ve
earned
so
much
money
then
it
s
all
settled
declared
uncle
naboth
i
ll
go
up
to
the
village
with
you
and
see
fair
play
twould
be
a
fine
chance
to
give
that
cankered
venus
a
piece
of
my
mind
just
as
a
parting
would
you
dare
sir
i
asked
recollecting
his
former
experience
with
ranck
would
i
dare
do
you
take
me
for
a
coward
then
demanded
the
old
man
indignantly
no
sir
but
i
never
mind
that
sam
i
was
worried
about
other
things
that
day
and
wasn
t
quite
myself
but
just
wait
till
i
get
the
old
serpent
face
to
face
that
s
all
all
right
uncle
when
shall
we
go
just
as
soon
as
we
ve
paid
all
the
bills
and
settled
our
accounts
for
the
last
voyage
a
week
ll
do
that
i
reckon
an
now
partner
just
run
out
and
hire
a
closed
carriage
and
we
ll
get
cap
n
gay
s
gold
to
the
bank
as
soon
as
possible
sam
my
boy
if
this
streak
o
luck
holds
good
we
ll
be
the
envy
of
rockyfeller
in
a
few
years
chapter
xviii
uncle
naboth
s
revenge
ten
days
later
having
paid
all
our
indebtedness
and
converted
every
ounce
of
our
gold
into
ready
money
that
was
deposited
to
the
credit
of
perkins
steele
at
the
bank
we
started
on
what
uncle
naboth
called
our
voyage
across
the
continent
we
had
both
taken
a
strong
liking
for
ned
britton
who
has
stood
by
us
so
faithfully
at
the
island
so
perkins
decided
to
make
ned
the
mate
of
the
new
ship
when
she
had
been
purchased
for
this
reason
and
because
the
sailor
wished
to
revisit
some
of
his
relatives
in
the
east
and
make
them
happy
by
sharing
with
them
his
prize
money
ned
also
traveled
on
the
same
train
with
us
britton
s
judgment
will
be
useful
in
helping
us
to
pick
out
a
ship
said
the
old
man
i
m
glad
he
s
going
with
nux
and
bryonia
had
promptly
deserted
the
flipper
as
soon
as
they
found
that
captain
gay
had
purchased
her
and
i
think
my
hardest
task
was
to
leave
the
simple
black
men
behind
me
they
declared
that
they
belonged
to
the
firm
and
must
be
given
places
on
the
new
ship
and
this
both
uncle
naboth
and
i
were
anxious
to
do
as
we
knew
we
could
never
again
find
such
loyal
and
unselfish
servants
but
it
would
be
folly
to
take
them
east
until
all
arrangements
had
been
made
so
i
found
them
comfortable
lodgings
and
supplied
them
with
all
the
money
they
could
possibly
require
until
they
were
sent
for
at
the
last
moment
they
were
at
the
station
to
see
the
train
move
away
and
were
so
fearful
of
the
iron
monster
that
was
to
carry
their
friends
on
the
journey
that
they
cautioned
me
again
and
again
to
be
very
careful
in
my
actions
fore
all
mars
sam
said
nux
earnestly
doan
you
go
skeer
dat
injine
on
no
count
w
en
it
s
skeert
it
smashes
ev
ything
into

gentle
nouf
now
sam
added
bry
but
don
you
trust
it
no
how
tain
t
safe
like
a
great
sail
an
a
stiff
right
you
are
lad
cried
uncle
naboth
approvingly
injines
is
an
invention
of
the
devil
bry
but
good
christians
can
use
em
if
they
only
watch
out
an
now
good
bye
an
take
care
o
yourselves
till
we
get
back
or
send
for
on
account
of
our
great
wealth
perkins
had
decided
to
take
a
tourist
for
the
trip
rather
than
sit
up
in
the
seats
of
the
common
cars
all
night
sleepin
cars
is
a
genuine
luxury
sam
he
said
an
only
fit
for
the
very
rich
who
ve
got
so
much
money
they
won
t
miss
it
or
the
very
poor
who
ve
got
so
little
there
s
no
use
savin
it
i
guess
we
can
afford
the
treat
and
the
bunks
in
this
ere
tourist
car
is
jest
as
big
as
the
ones
in
the
coaches
ahead
so
as
soon
as
we
get
clear
of
frisco
let
s
go
to
but
it
isn
t
dark
yet
uncle
i
protested
it
won
t
be
bedtime
for
sam
replied
the
old
man
earnestly
do
you
mean
to
say
you
re
goin
to
pay
for
a
bed
and
let
it
lay
idle
that
s
what
i
call
rank
extravagance
i
ve
seen
it
done
on
my
travels
o
course
i
ve
known
a
man
to
pay
three
dollars
for
a
bed
an
then
set
up
half
the
night
in
the
smokin
cars
before
he
turns
in
but
do
you
s
pose
the
railroad
company
pays
him
back
half
the
money
never
they
just
laughs
at
him
and
keeps
the
whole
three
dollars
to
pay
for
a
thing
and
use
it
ain
t
extravagance
but
to
buy
a
bed
and
then
set
up
half
the
night
is
why
it
s
like
payin
for
a
dinner
an
then
skippin
half
the
courses
would
a
sensible
man
do
that
not
if
he
s
hungry
uncle
said
i
laughing
at
this
philosophy
if
he
ain
t
hungry
he
buys
a
sandwich
an
not
a
cried
uncle
naboth
triumphantly
nevertheless
being
fully
conscious
of
my
newly
acquired
wealth
i
recklessly
sat
up
until
bedtime
while
my
thrifty
uncle
occupied
his
bunk
and
snored
peacefully
the
journey
was
accomplished
in
safety
and
from
boston
we
took
the
little
railway
to
the
seaport
town
of
batteraft
during
the
last
hours
of
the
trip
uncle
naboth
had
become
very
thoughtful
and
i
frequently
noticed
him
making
laborious
memoranda
with
his
pencil
on
the
backs
of
envelopes
and
scraps
of
paper
which
he
took
from
his
wallet
finally
i
asked
what
are
you
writing
uncle
i
m
jest
jotting
down
the
things
i
mean
to
say
to
that
old
female
shark
at
batteraft
was
the
reply
i
tell
you
sam
she
s
goin
to
have
the
talkin
of
her
life
when
i
get
at
her
and
she
ll
deserve
every
word
of
it
i
ll
let
you
pay
her
first
so
s
the

i

try
to
square
the
moral
will
she
let
you
i
enquired
doubtfully
for
i
had
a
vivid
remembrance
of
ranck
s
dislike
of
any
opposition
she
can
t
help
herself
replied
uncle
naboth
seriously
if
you
knew
the
things
she
up
an
said
to
me
that
day
i
tackled
her
before
sam
an
the
harsh
an
impident
tones
she
used
to
say
em
with
you
d
realize
how
much
my
revenge
means
to
why
didn
t
you
resent
it
then
uncle
why
she
took
me
by
surprise
an
i
didn
t
have
time
to
collect
my
parrergraphs
and
that
s
the
reason
also
it
s
the
reason
i
m
figgerin
out
my
speeches
aforehand
this
time
so
s
i
won
t
be
backwards
when
the
time
comes
you
can
t
thrash
the
cantankerous
old
termagen
like
you
would
a
man
but
you
can
lash
her
with
speeches
that
cuts
like
a
sword
at
sarcasm
and
ironical
i
m
quite
a
professor
sam
but
them
talents
would
be
wasted
on
ranck
with
her
i
ll
open
my
vials
o
wrath
an
empty
em
to
the
dregs
i
ll
wither
her
with
scorn
an
tell
her
just
what
i
think
o
her
he
concluded
rather
lamely
i
sighed
for
the
mention
of
ranck
always
recalled
to
me
the
fate
of
my
poor
father
the
landscape
began
to
grow
very
familiar
now
and
presently
the
train
swung
into
the
little
station
where
i
had
so
often
stood
in
my
younger
days
to
watch
the
passengers
get
on
and
off
the
cars
ned
britton
at
once
walked
on
to
the
tavern
but
as
the
afternoon
was
only
half
gone
uncle
naboth
and
i
decided
to
go
on
up
to
my
father
s
old
home
without
delay
and
have
our
carefully
planned
interview
with
ranck
the
banknotes
i
was
to
pay
to
her
lay
crisply
in
my
new
and
i
was
eager
to
be
free
of
my
debt
to
the
cruel
woman
who
had
aspersed
my
dead
father
s
character
and
driven
me
from
my
old
home
uncle
naboth
walked
very
fast
at
first
but
while
we
ascended
the
little
hill
his
pace
grew
gradually
slower
and
as
we
reached
the
bench
beneath
the
trees
from
whence
our
first
view
of
the
cottage
was
obtained
my
uncle
suddenly
set
himself
down
and
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
with
the
crimson
handkerchief
we
ll
rest
a
minute
sam
so
s
i
can
get
my
breath
back
he
gasped
i
ll
need
it
all
presently
and
ain
t
my
special
so
i
sat
down
beside
him
and
waited
patiently
eyeing
the
while
rather
sadly
the
old
home
where
i
had
once
been
so
happy
it
seemed
not
to
have
changed
in
any
way
since
i
left
it
the
blinds
of
my
little
room
in
the
attic
were
closed
but
those
of
the
lower
floor
were
thrown
back
and
a
column
of
thin
smoke
ascended
lazily
from
the
chimney
showing
that
the
place
was
still
inhabited
in
spite
of
myself
i
shivered
the
autumn
air
struck
me
as
being
chilly
for
the
first
time
and
the
declining
sun
moved
slowly
behind
a
cloud
throwing
the
same
gloom
over
the
landscape
that
was
already
in
my
heart
are
you
ready
uncle
i
asked
unable
to
bear
the
suspense
longer
jest
a
minute
sam
let
s
see
the
opening
shot
was
this
way
there
s
folks
ma
am
that
can
be
more
heartless
than
the
brute
beasts
more
slyer
than
a
roarin
tiger
more
fiercer
than
a
yellow
fox
an
that
isn
t
right
uncle
naboth
i
interrupted
the
fox
is
sly
and
the
i
know
i
know
them
speeches
is
gettin
sorter
mixed
in
my
mind
but
if
that
don
t
quail
when
she
hears
em
my
name
ain
t
naboth
perkins
perhaps
i
ought
to
have
committed
em
more
to
sam
what
do
you
say
to
waitin
till
tomorrow
no
uncle
let
s
go
to
her
now
you
can
reserve
your
vials
of
wrath
if
you
want
to
but
i
shan
t
sleep
a
wink
unless
i
pay
ranck
that
all
right
said
the
old
man
with
assumed
cheerfulness
there
s
no
time
like
the
present
never
put
off
til
tomorrer
you
know
come
along
my
lad
he
sprang
up
and
led
the
way
with
alacrity
for
a
few
steps
and
then
slackened
his
pace
perceptibly
if
i
m
goin
to
forget
all
them
speeches
he
whispered
in
a
voice
that
trembled
slightly
i
might
jest
as
well
have
saved
my
time
of
em
drat
the
old
if
she
wasn
t
a
woman
i
d
pitch
her
into
the
by
this
time
i
was
myself
too
much
agitated
to
pay
attention
to
my
uncle
s
evident
fright
on
the
eve
of
battle
the
house
was
very
near
now
a
few
steps
further
and
we
were
standing
upon
the
little
porch
you
knock
uncle
i
said
in
a
whisper
uncle
naboth
glanced
at
me
reproachfully
and
then
raised
his
knuckles
but
before
they
touched
the
panel
of
the
door
he
paused
drew
out
his
handkerchief
and
again
wiped
his
brow
i
felt
that
my
nerves
would
hear
no
further
strain
with
the
desperation
of
despair
or
a
sudden
accession
of
never
knew
rapped
loudly
upon
the
door
a
moment
s
profound
silence
was
followed
by
a
peculiar
sound
thump
thump
thump
echoed
from
the
room
inside
at
regular
intervals
and
then
the
door
was
suddenly
opened
and
a
man
with
a
wooden
leg
stood
before
us
he
was
clothed
in
sailor
fashion
and
a
bushy
beard
ornamented
his
round
frank
face
for
an
instant
we
three
stood
regarding
one
another
in
mute
wonder
the
open
door
disclosed
the
long
at
the
back
end
of
which
ranck
stood
by
the
kitchen
table
with
a
plate
in
one
hand
and
a
towel
in
the
other
motionless
as
a
marble
statue
and
with
a
look
of
terror
fixed
upon
her
white
face
singularly
enough
i
was
the
first
to
recover
from
my
surprise
dad
i
cried
in
a
glad
voice
and
threw
myself
joyfully
into

sailor

the
conquest
of

i
regret
to
say
that
my
father
s
welcome
was
not
especially
cordial
nevertheless
he
was
for
some
reason
evidently
pleased
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
his
son
and
his
releasing
himself
gently
from
my
clinging
embrace
he
said
in
his
deep
grave
voice

in
and
sit
down
i
never
thought
to
see
you
again

and
much
less

fairly
screamed
in
her
shrill
voice

commanded
the
captain
sternly
this

although
it

added
bitterly

my
a
sudden
tenderness
that
crept
into

words

to
rouse
the
woman
to
fury

boy
that
robbed

cried
pointing
at
me
a
trembling
bony
finger

the

the
man
turning
fiercely
upon
my
horrified

as
aided

abetted

in

at

time
captain
steele
looked
toward
me
gravely
as
i
stood
regarding
the
woman
with
unmistakable
amazement
then
he
turned
to
naboth
perkins
to
find
the
little
man
doubled
up
in
his
chair
and
shaking
with
silent
laughter
a
moment
later
he
began
to
gasp
and
choke
and
cough
until
just
as
he
appeared
to
be
on
the
verge
of
convulsions
he
suddenly
straightened
up
and
wiped
the
tears
from
his
eyes

said

minute
that

a
lyin
tale
as
you

trumped
up
would

turned
away
and
caught
her
shawl
from
a
peg

said
sullenly
no

perkins
bounding
between
her
and
the
door
of
her
room
toward
which
she
was
hastening

mystery

my
father
nodded
gazing
with
lowering
brow
upon
the
cowed
and
trembling
form
of
the
housekeeper
the
cap
n
s
property
an
his
savin

didn

continued
uncle

this
woman

both
here

an
if
you

to
wiggle

i
ll
call
the
police
the
woman
obeyed
a
dull
glaze
had
come
over
her
eyes
and
her
features
were
white
and
set
in
all
her
cunning
plotting
she
had
never
imagined
that
i
or
my
uncle
would
ever
return
to
batteraft
to
confound
her
she
believed
that
the
knowledge
that
i
was
in
her
debt
would
prevent
my
coming
back
in
any
event
and
she
fully
expected
me
to
be
buffeted
here
and
there
about
the
world
with
never
a
chance
of
my
being
again
heard
of
in
my
old
home
what
a
mistake
she
had
made
but
it
was
all
owing
to
this
little
fat
man
whom
she
had
driven
thoughtlessly
from
her
door
the
day
that
i
was
sent
away
into
exile
she
had
never
heard
of
naboth
perkins
before
nor
did
she
know
any
more
than
i
myself
did
at
the
time
of
the
partnership
formerly
existing
between
the
two
men
or
even
the
fact
of
their
relationship
she
felt
that
she
was
caught
in
a
trap
in
some
unexpected
way
and
the
disaster
stunned
her
captain
steele
filled
and
lighted
his
pipe
before
the
silence
of
the
little
group
was
again
broken
then
turning
to
me
he
asked
why
did
you
believe
i
was
dead
one
of
your
sailors
brought
the
news
sir
and
told
us
of
the
wreck
he
gave
ranck
your
watch
and
ring
which
he
believed
were
taken
from
your
dead
it
s
a
lie
snapped
the
woman
desperately
i
never
seen
the
watch
and
ring
but
he
said
the
cap
n
was
dead
all
right
an
that
s
why
sam
run
away
with
the
who
was
the
sailor
enquired
my
father
thoughtfully
ned
britton
aye
an
honest
worthy
lad
who
sailed
with
me
for
years
and
he
had
the
watch
and
ring
yes
sir
ned
was
taken
with
a
fever
when
he
escaped
from
the
wreck
and
after
he
recovered
they
told
him
that
several
bodies
had
been
washed
ashore
and
buried
by
the
villagers
on
one
of
the
bodies
they
found
the
watch
and
ring
so
ned
naturally
thought
you
had
when
the
ship
broke
up
said
captain
steele
slowly
and
i
knew
the
end
had
come
i
sent
one
of
my
lads
to
my
cabin
to
get
my
trinkets
while
i
attended
to
lowering
the
boats
i
never
saw
him
again
for
my
part
my
leg
was
crushed
by
a
falling
mast
but
i
got
entangled
in
the
rigging
and
the
mast
floated
me
to
a
little
island
where
a
dozen
lived
one
was
a
bit
of
a
doctor
and
cut
away
my
mangled
leg
and
nursed
me
back
to
life
while
i
waited
for
a
ship
to
touch
the
island
i
regained
my
strength
and
made
myself
a
new
leg
out
of
then
one
day
a
schooner
carried
me
to
plymouth
and
the
captain
who
was
a
kindly
man
loaned
me
enough
money
to
bring
me
to
batteraft
where
i
thought
i
d
find
my
savings
enough
to
buy
a
new
ship
and
start
business
again
but
ranck
met
me
with
the
news
that
my
son
had
stripped
the
house
of
all
my
valuables
and
run
away
with
a
man
that
was
known
to
be
a
pirate
my
room
was
quite
bare
i
found
and
ranck
claimed
she
had
hardly
enough
left
of
her
savings
to
buy
food
with
so
here
i
was
a
cripple
and
condemned
to
poverty
after
a
successful
career
and
it
s
no
wonder
my
thoughts
were
bitter
towards
my
son
whom
i
never
would
have
believed
could
act
so
ungratefully
my
only
comfort
was
that
sam
had
believed
me
uncle
naboth
nodded
approval
quite
proper
sir
he
said
an
all
quite
right
and
shipshape
sam
didn
t
take
a
penny
s
worth
from
this
house
but
i
made
him
my
partner
in
your
place
and
we
ve
had
a
successful
voyage
and
come
back
rich
as
croesuses
you
ll
live
in
clover
from
this
time
on
cap
n
steele
even
if
you
never
get
back
the
property
ranck
has
robbed
you
of
but
why
not
make
her
give
it
up
she
can
t
have
squandered
it
on
riotous
living
by
the
looks
of
captain
steele
turned
to
the
housekeeper
what
have
you
to
say
ranck
he
asked
it
s
all
a
pack
o
lies
she
snarled
but
there
s
no
call
for
you
to
believe
me
if
you
don
t
want
to
one
thing
s
certain
though
this
is
my
house
an
the
deed
of
it
s
in
my
name
you
ll
have
to
clear
out
o
here
all
three
of
you
or
i
ll
have
the
law
on
you
an
put
you
out
captain
steele
arose
calmly
and
seized
the
woman
by
her
arms
in
spite
of
her
screams
and
struggles
he
carried
her
to
his
own
little
room
and
thrust
her
in
locking
the
door
safely
upon
her
now
said
he
let
s
explore
the
place
and
see
what
we
can
find
i
ve
never
been
in
ranck
s
room
for
until
today
i
had
no
suspicions
of
her
come
with
me
if
she
s
honest
we
shall
find
nothing
for
she
can
t
have
disposed
of
the
right
you
are
sir
cried
uncle
naboth
springing
up
and
we
all
three
at
once
proceeded
to
enter
the
room
the
housekeeper
had
for
so
many
years
reserved
for
her
own
use
it
was
simply
and
plainly
furnished
and
a
single
glance
served
to
convince
us
that
it
contained
no
evidence
whatever
of
the
missing
property
illustration
here
s
the
treasure
house
sir
he
exclaimed
triumphantly
strange
said
my
father
musingly
there
were
nine
cases
and
three
chests
besides
the
great
that
i
found
still
in
my
room
although
emptied
of
all
its
contents
whatever
could
have
become
of
them
all
dad
i
exclaimed
suddenly
i
remember
there
used
to
be
a
sort
of
cellar
under
this
room
that
could
only
be
reached
by
a
true
replied
my
father
i
remember
that
too
but
where
is
the
trap
uncle
naboth
was
already
making
a
careful
inspection
of
the
old
rag
carpet
that
covered
the
floor
in
one
corner
the
tacks
seemed
far
apart
and
scanty
he
seized
the
carpet
and
jerked
it
away
from
the
fastenings
disclosing
a
small
square
trap
with
an
iron
ring
in
the
center
here
s
the
treasure
house
sir
he
announced
triumphantly
get
a
candle
sam
said
my
father
gravely
when
it
was
brought
all
three
of
us
descended
the
narrow
stairs
to
the
underground
room
where
the
cases
and
chests
were
speedily
found
all
stored
in
orderly
fashion
against
the
walls
the
contents
of
the
great
sea
chest
which
she
had
doubtless
removed
before
admitting
me
to
the
captain
s
room
had
been
placed
in
boxes
which
ranck
had
secured
from
the
grocery
store
in
addition
to
captain
steele
s
property
there
was
also
a
brass
kettle
almost
full
of
gold
and
silver
coins
which
the
miserly
old
woman
had
saved
from
the
money
my
father
had
given
her
to
clothe
and
care
for
me
as
well
as
to
defray
the
household
expenses
while
the
sailor
was
away
upon
his
voyages
perhaps
her
own
wages
were
added
to
this
store
as
well
anyway
captain
steele
seemed
to
think
so
for
after
assuring
himself
that
all
his
missing
property
was
safe
he
carried
the
kettle
up
to
the
living
room
and
proceeded
to
liberate
ranck
when
scowling
but
subdued
she
crept
from
the
little
room
my
father
offered
to
give
to
her
the
entire
contents
of
the
kettle
if
she
would
freely
transfer
to
him
the
deed
to
the
house
and
quit
batteraft
for
good
and
all
it
s
more
than
you
deserve
said
he
but
i
don
t
want
to
go
to
the
police
in
this
matter
unless
you
force
me
to
take
the
money
and
go
and
never
let
me
see
your
face
in
batteraft
of
course
she
accepted
the
generous
proposition
after
gathering
her
few
clothes
into
a
bundle
she
took
her
treasure
and
left
the
house
the
first
train
that
left
batteraft
carried
her
with
it
and
i
have
never
seen
her
since
i
acknowledge
that
i
watched
her
go
with
a
lighter
and
happier
heart
than
i
had
known
for
months
it
was
in
this
way
that
she
once
drove
me
from
my
old
home
father
i
said
but
it
can
t
be
such
a
bad
world
after
all
for
if
the
wicked
sometimes
appear
to
triumph
they
are
usually
punished
in
the
end
and
now
that
ranck
has
passed
out
of
our
lives
we
ought
to
be
very
happy
we
will
be

my
father
earnestly
as
he
affectionately
pressed
my
hand
hooray

steele
perkins
and
steele
captain
steele
was
extremely
grateful
to
uncle
naboth
for
his
care
of
me
and
was
delighted
by
the
relation
of
our
adventures
on
the
golden
island
as
well
as
pardonably
proud
of
the
financial
success
we
had
attained
a
new
firm
was
created
under
the
title
of
steele
perkins
and
steele
and
a
new
ship
was
soon
found
that
seemed
to
have
been
especially
constructed
to
meet
our
requirements
captain
steele
declaring
that
his
wooden
leg
would
in
no
way
interfere
with
his
usefulness
decided
to
command
the
ship
himself
and
ned
britton
was
made
first
mate
uncle
naboth
and
i
were
appointed
to
look
after
all
the
finances
and
attend
to
the
trading
at
the
various
ports
and
nux
and
bryonia
were
brought
from
san
francisco
and
given
posts
on
the
new
ship
to
their
great
delight
by
the
advice
of
his
shrewder
my
father
converted
all
his
accumulated
treasures
into
money
which
was
safely
invested
in
government
bonds
that
were
deposited
in
a
boston
bank
whatever
happens
now
observed
uncle
naboth
nobody
can
t
rob
you
again
and
if
our
business
ventures
proves
unsuccessful
and
sam
and
i
go
bankrupt
you
ve
always
got
something
to
fall
back
on
in
your
old
but
success
seemed
to
follow
in
the
wake
of
the
new
firm
and
the
cleopatra
as
our
ship
is
named
has
made
voyage
after
voyage
with
unvarying
good
fortune
