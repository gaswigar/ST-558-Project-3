lincoln
it
is
hard
when
englishmen
patience
must
be
thus
jetted
on
by
strangers
and
they
not
dare
to
revenge
their
own
wrongs
george
lincoln
let
beat
them
down
and
bear
no
more
of
these
abuses
lincoln
we
may
not

be
patient
and

stranger
take

endured
george
let

revenge
my
lord
ambassador
shall
once
more
make
your
major
have
a
check
if
he
punish
thee
for
this
saucy
presumption
williamson
indeed
my
lord
mayor
on
the
ambassador
complaint
sent
me
to
newgate
one
day
because
against
my
will
i
took
the
wall
of
a
stranger
you
may
do
any
thing
the
goldsmith
wife
and
mine
now
must
be
at
your
commandment
george
the
more
patient
fools
are
ye
both
to
suffer
it
barde
suffer

thou

george
i
tell

lombard
these
words

why
betts
am
not
i
as
dear
t

as
my
lord
mayor
wife
to

and
wilt
thou
so
neglectly
suffer
thine
own
shame
hands
off
proud
stranger
or
by
him
that
bought
me
if
men
milky
hearts
dare
not
strike
a
stranger
yet
women
beat
them
down
ere
they
bear
these
abuses
barde
mistress
i
say
you
shall
along
with
me
doll
touch
not
doll
williamson
least
she
lay
thee
along
on
god
dear
and
you
sir
to
caveler
that
allow
such
coarse
cates
to
carpenters
whilst
pigeons
which
they
pay
for
must
serve
your
dainty
appetite
deliver
them
back
to
my
husband
again
or
i
call
so
many
women
to
mine
assistance
as
will
not
leave
one
inch
untorn
of
thee
if
our
husbands
must
be
bridled
by
law
and
forced
to
bear
your
wrongs
their
wives
will
be
a
little
lawless
and
soundly
beat
ye
caveler
come
away
de
barde
and
let
us
go
complain
to
my
lord
ambassador
exeunt
ambo
doll
aye
go
and
send
him
among
us
and
we
give
him
his
welcome
i
am
ashamed
that
freeborn
englishmen
having
beaten
strangers
within
their
own
homes
should
thus
be
braved
and
abused
by
them
at
home
sherwin
it
is
not
our
lack
of
courage
in
the
cause
but
the
strict
obedience
that
we
are
bound
to
i
am
the
goldsmith
whose
wrongs
you
talked
of
but
how
to
redress
yours
or
mine
own
is
a
matter
beyond
our
abilities
lincoln
not
so
not
so
my
good
friends
i
though
a
mean
man
a
broker
by
profession
and
named
john
lincoln
have
long
time
winked
at
these
wild
enormities
with
mighty
impatience
and
as
these
two
brethren
here
betts
by
name
can
witness
with
loss
of
mine
own
life
would
gladly
remedy
them
george
and
he
is
in
a
good
forwardness
i
tell
ye
if
all
hit
right
doll
as
how
i
prithee
tell
it
to
doll
williamson
lincoln
you
know
the
spittle
sermons
begin
the
next
week
i
have
drawn
a
bill
of
our
wrongs
and
the
strangers
insolences
george
which
he
means
the
preachers
shall
there
openly
publish
in
the
pulpit
williamson
oh
but
that
they
would
yfaith
it
would
tickle
our
strangers
thoroughly
doll
aye
and
if
you
men
durst
not
undertake
it
before
god
we
women
would
take
an
honest
woman
from
her
husband
why
it
is
intolerable
sherwin
but
how
find
ye
the
preachers
affected
to
our
proceeding
lincoln
master
doctor
standish
hath
answered
that
it
becomes
not
him
to
move
any
such
thing
in
his
sermon
and
tells
us
we
must
move
the
mayor
and
aldermen
to
reform
it
and
doubts
not
but
happy
success
will
ensue
on
statement
of
our
wrongs
you
shall
perceive
no
hurt
in
the
bill
here
a
couple
of
it
i
pray
ye
hear
it
all
with
all
our
hearts
for
god
sake
read
it
lincoln
reads
to
you
all
the
worshipful
lords
and
masters
of
this
city
that
will
take
compassion
over
the
poor
people
your
neighbors
and
also
of
the
great
importable
hurts
losses
and
hinderances
whereof
proceedeth
extreme
poverty
to
all
the
king
subjects
that
inhabit
within
this
city
and
suburbs
of
the
same
for
so
it
is
that
aliens
and
strangers
eat
the
bread
from
the
fatherless
children
and
take
the
living
from
all
the
artificers
and
the
intercourse
from
all
the
merchants
whereby
poverty
is
so
much
increased
that
every
man
bewaileth
the
misery
of
other
for
craftsmen
be
brought
to
beggary
and
merchants
to
neediness
wherefore
the
premises
considered
the
redress
must
be
of
the
common
knit
and
united
to
one
part
and
as
the
hurt
and
damage
grieveth
all
men
so
must
all
men
see
to
their
willing
power
for
remedy
and
not
suffer
the
said
aliens
in
their
wealth
and
the
natural
born
men
of
this
region
to
come
to
confusion
doll
before
god
tis
excellent
and
i
maintain
the
suit
to
be
honest
sherwin
well
say
tis
read
what
is
your
further
meaning
in
the
matter
george

me

lay
to
tempt
the

the
purpose
of
this

desperate
case
wherein

in

seven
pounds
odd

on

more
seven
pounds
odd

what
were
you
so
mad
being
a
wise
man
and
a
magistrate
to
trust
your
purse
with
such
a
liberal
sum
seven
pounds
odd
money
fore
god
it
is
a
shame
with
such
a
sum
to
tempt
necessity
i
promise
ye
a
man
that
goes
abroad
with
an
intent
of
truth
meeting
such
a
booty
may
be
wrought
to
that
he
never
thought
what
makes
so
many
pilferers
and
felons
but
these
fond
baits
that
foolish
people
lay
to
tempt
the
needy
miserable
wretch
should
he
be
taken
now
that
has
your
purse
i
stand
you
are
guilty
of
his
death
for
questionless
he
would
be
cast
by
law
twere
a
good
deed
to
fine
ye
as
much
more
to
the
relief
of
the
poor
prisoners
to
teach
ye
lock
your

up
at

suresby
well
master
more
you
are
a
merry

i
find
ye
well
enough
more
nay
ye
shall
see
sir
trusting
thus
your
money
and
lifter
here
in
trial
for
like
case
but
that
the
poor
man
is
a
prisoner
it
would
be
now
suspected
that
he
had
it
thus
may
ye
see
what
mischief
often
comes
by
the
fond
carriage
of
such
needless
sums
lord
mayor
believe
me
master
suresby
this
is
strange
you
being
a
man
so
settled
in
assurance
will
fall
in
that
which
you
condemned
in

more
well
master
suresby

from

so
well
a
tempered
mercy
and
a
grace
to
all
the
aliens
in
this
fruitful

four
hundred

some
wronged
citizens
that
found

oft
cast
into

for

employed

that
fell
about
the

where
by
persuasion
i
enforced
the
wrongs
and
urged
the
grief
of
the
displeased
city
he
answered
me
and
with
a
solemn
oath
that
if
he
had
the
mayor
of
london
wife
he
would
keep
her
in
despite

my

our

some

now
will
take
the

from

he
hath
bought
a
carpenter
as
i
was
late
informed
who
having
bought
a
pair
of
doves
in
cheap
immediately
a
frenchman
took
them
from
him
and
beat
the
poor
man
for
resisting
him
and
when
the
fellow
did
complain
his
wrongs
he
was
severely
punished
for
his
labor
surrey

if
the
english
blood
be
once

up
as
i
perceive
their

already
full
i
fear
me
much
before
their

be
cold
some
of
these
saucy
aliens
for
their
pride
will
pay
for
soundly
wheresoere
it
lights
this
tide
of
rage
that
with

the

wherein
you

till

had
been
from

alas
poor

what

it
you
have
got
although
we
grant
you
get
the
thing
you
seek
george

the
removing
of
the

which
can
not
choose
but
much
advantage
the
poor
handicrafts
of
the
city
more
grant
them
removed
and
grant
that
this
your
noise
hath
chid
down
all
the
majesty
of
england
imagine
that
you
see
the
wretched
strangers
their
babies
at
their
backs
and
their
poor
luggage
plodding
to
th
ports
and
costs
for
transportation
and
that
you
sit
as
kings
in
your
desires
authority
quite
silent
by
your
brawl
and
you
in
ruff
of
your
opinions
clothed
what
had
you
got
i
tell
you
you
had
taught
how
insolence
and
strong
hand
should
prevail
how
order
should
be
quelled
and
by
this
pattern
not
one
of
you
should
live
an
aged
man
for
other
ruffians
as
their
fancies
wrought
with
self
same
hand
self
reasons
and
self
right
would
shark
on
you
and
men
like
ravenous
fishes
would
feed
on
one
another
doll
before
god
that
as
true
as
the
gospel
lincoln
nay
this
is
a
sound
fellow
i
tell
you
let
mark
him
more
let
me
set
up
before
your
thoughts
good
friends
on
supposition
which
if
you
will
mark
you
shall
perceive
how
horrible
a
shape
your
innovation
bears
first
tis
a
sin
which
oft
the
apostle
did
forewarn
us
of
urging
obedience
to
authority
and
twere
no
error
if
i
told
you
all
you
were
in
arms
against
your
god
himself
all
marry
god
forbid
that
more
nay
certainly
you
are
for
to
the
king
god
hath
his
office
lent
of
dread
of
justice
power
and
command
hath
bid
him
rule
and
willed
you
to
obey
and
to
add
ampler
majesty
to
this
he
hath
not
only
lent
the
king
his
figure
his
throne
and
sword
but
given
him
his
own
name
calls
him
a
god
on
earth
what
do
you
then
rising
gainst
him
that
god
himself
installs
but
rise
against
god
what
do
you
to
your
souls
in
doing
this
o
desperate
as
you
are
wash
your
foul
minds
with
tears
and
those
same
hands
that
you
like
rebels
lift
against
the
peace
lift
up
for
peace
and
your
unreverent
knees
make
them
your
feet
to
kneel
to
be
forgiven
tell
me
but
this
what
rebel
captain
as
mutinies
are
incident
by
his
name
can
still
the
rout
who
will
obey
a
traitor
or
how
can
well
that
proclamation
sound
when
there
is
no
addition
but
a
rebel
to
qualify
a
rebel
you
put
down
strangers
kill
them
cut
their
throats
possess
their
houses
and
lead
the
majesty
of
law
in
line
to
slip
him
like
a
hound
say
now
the
king
as
he
is
clement
if
th
offender
mourn
should
so
much
come
to
short
of
your
great
trespass
as
but
to
banish
you
whether
would
you
go
what
country
by
the
nature
of
your
error
should
give
you
harbor
go
you
to
france
or
flanders
to
any
german
province
to
spain
or
portugal
nay
any
where
that
not
adheres
to
england
why
you
must
needs
be
strangers
would
you
be
pleased
to
find
a
nation
of
such
barbarous
temper
that
breaking
out
in
hideous
violence
would
not
afford
you
an
abode
on
earth
whet
their
detested
knives
against
your
throats
spurn
you
like
dogs
and
like
as
if
that
god
owed
not
nor
made
not
you
nor
that
the
claimants
were
not
all
appropriate
to
your
comforts
but
chartered
unto
them
what
would
you
think
to
be
thus
used
this
is
the
strangers
case
and
this
your
mountanish
inhumanity

sheriff
what
is
it
clown
that
as
you
have
hanged
lincoln
first
and
will
hang
her
next
so
you
will
not
hang
me
at
all
sheriff
nay
you
set
ope
the
counter
gates
and
you
must
hang
for
the
folly
clown
well
then
so
much
for
it
doll
sir
your
free
bounty
much
contents
my
mind
commend
me
to
that
good
shrieve
master
more
and
tell
him
not
been
for
his
persuasion
john
lincoln
had
not
hung
here
as
he
does
we
would
first
have
locked
us
up
in
leadenhall
and
there
been
burnt
to
ashes
with
the
roof
sheriff
woman
what
master
more
did
was
a
subject
duty
and
hath
so
pleased
our
gracious
lord
the
king
that
he
is
hence
removed
to
higher
place
and
made
of
council
to
his
majesty
doll
well
is
he
worthy
of
it
by
my
troth
an
honest
wise
well
spoken
gentleman
yet
would
i
praise
his
honesty
much
more
if
he
had
kept
his
word
and
saved
our
lives
but
let
that
pass
men
are
but
men
and
so
words
are
but
words
and
pays
not
what
men
you
husband
since
perhaps
the
world
may
say
that
through
my
means
thou
comest
thus
to
thy
end
here
i
begin
this
cup
of
death
to
thee
because
thou
shalt
be
sure
to
taste
no
worse
than
i
have
taken
that
must
go
before
thee
what
though
i
be
a
woman
that
no

i
do
owe
god
a
death
and
i
must
pay
him
husband
give
me
thy
hand
be
not
dismayed
this
chair
being
chaired
then
all
our
debt
is
paid
only
two
little
babes
we
leave
behind
us
and
all
i
can
bequeath
them
at
this
time
is
but
the
love
of
some
good
honest
friend
to
bring
them
up
in
charitable
sort
what
masters
he
goes
upright
that
never
halts
and
they
may
live
to
mend
their
parents
faults

surrey
i
tell
ye
master
sheriff
you
are
too
forward
to
make
such
haste
with
men
unto
their
death
i
think
your
pains
will
merit
little
thanks
since
that
his
highness
is
so
merciful
as
not
to
spill
the
blood
of
any
subject
sheriff
my
noble
lord
would
we
so
much
had
known
the

warrant
hastened
our
dispatch
it
had
not
else
been
done
so
suddenly
surrey
sir
thomas
more
humbly
upon
his
knee
did
beg
the
lives
of
all
since
on
his
word
they
did
so
gently
yield
the
king
hath
granted
it
and
made
him
lord
high
chancellor
of
england
according
as
he
worthily
deserves
since
lincoln
life
can
not
be
had
again
then
for
the
rest
from
my
dread
sovereign
lips
i
here
pronounce
free
pardon
for
them
all
all

save

god
save
the

my
good
lord

and
the
earl

flinging
up

doll

desires
it
from
her
very
heart
more
name
may
live
for
this
right
noble
part
and
whensoere
we
talk
of
ill
may
day
praise
more
surrey
in
hope
his
highness
clemency
and
mercy
which
in
the
arms
of
mild
and
meek
compassion
would
rather
clip
you
as
the
loving
nurse
oft
doth
the
wayward
infant
then
to
leave
you
to
the
sharp
rod
of
justice
so
to
draw
you
to
shun
such
lewd
assemblies
as
beget
unlawful
riots
and
such
traitorous
acts
that
striking
with
the
hand
of
private
hate
maim
your
dear
country
with
a
public
wound
oh
god
that
mercy
whose
majestic
brow
should
be
unwrinkled
and
that
awful
justice
which
looketh
through
a
vail
of
sufferance
upon
the
frailty
of
the
multitude
should
with
the
clamours
of
outrageous
wrongs
be
stirred

more
it
is
in

that
i

and
that
which

profanely

shaped
just
to
that
strength
of
nature
which
we
are

withal
good

good

that
i
from
such
an

bench
of

should
step
as
twere
up
to
my

head
and
give
the
law
out
there
i
in

to
take

and
him
bind
by

to
give
the
smooth

me
that
owe
it
him
by

sure
these
things
not

the

thou
in

a
fray
in

because
they
would
not
be

faulkner
my
noble
lord
paniar
allies
throat
was
open
more
sirrah
hold
your

faulkner
i
prove
the
street
was
not

fellow
was
a
principal
broacher
of
the

between

lie
there
but
a
month
faulkner
i
not
lose
a
hair
to
be
lord
chancellor
of
europe
more
to
newgate
then
sirrah
great

that
body
where

foul
head
away
with
him
exeunt
all
except
randall
enter
surrey
erasmus
and
attendants
surrey
now
great
erasmus
you
approach
the
presence
of
a
most
worthy
learned
gentleman
this
little
isle
holds
not
a
truer
friend
unto
the
arts
nor
doth
his
greatness
add
a
feigned
flourish
to
his
worthy
parts
he
great
in
study
that
the
statist
grace
that
gains
more
reverence
than
the
outward
place
erasmus
report
my
lord
hath
crossed
the
narrow
seas
and
to
the
several
parts
of
christendom
hath
borne
the
fame
of
your
lord
chancellor
i
long
to
see
him
whom
with
loving
thoughts
i
in
my
study
oft
have
visited
is
that
sir
thomas
more
surrey
it
is
erasmus
now
shall
you
view
the
honorablest
scholar
the
most
religious
politician
the
worthiest
counsellor
that
tends
our
state
that
study
is
the
general
watch
of
england
in
it
the
prince
safety
and
the
peace
that
shines
upon
our
commonwealth
are
forged
by
loyal
industry
erasmus
i
doubt
him
not
to
be
as
near
the
life
of
excellence
as
you
proclaim
him
when
his
meanest
servants
are
of
some
weight
you
saw
my
lord
his
porter
give
entertainment
to
us
at
the
gate
in
latin
good
phrase
what
the
master
then
when
such
good
parts
shine
in
his
meanest
men
surrey
his
lordship
hath
some
weighty
business
for
see
yet
he
takes
no
notice
of
us
erasmus
i
think
twere
best
i
did
my
duty
to
him
in
a
short
latin
qui
in
celiberima
patria
natus
est
ett
gloriosa
plus
habet
negotii
ut
in

veniat
quam
qui
randall
i
prithee
good
erasmus
be
covered
i
have
forsworn
speaking
of
latin
else
as
i
am
true
counsellor
i
tickle
you
with
a
speech
nay
sit
erasmus
sit
good
my
lord
of
surrey
i
make
my
lady
come
to
you
anon
if
she
will
and
give
you
entertainment
erasmus
is
this
sir
thomas
more
surrey
oh
good
erasmus
you
must
conceive
his
vain
he
ever
furnished
with
these
conceits
randall
yes
faith
my
learned
poet
doth
not
lie
for
that
matter
i
am
neither
more
nor
less
than
merry
sir
thomas
always
wilt
sup
with
me
by
god
i
love
a
parlous
wise
fellow
that
smells
of
a
politician
better
than
a
long
progress
enter
sir
thomas
more
surrey
we
are
deluded
this
is
not
his
lordship
randall
i
pray
you
erasmus
how
long
will
the
holland
cheese
in
your
country
keep
without
maggots
more
fool
painted
barbarism
retire
thyself
into
thy
first
creation
exit
randall
thus
you
see
my
loving
learned
friends
how
far
respect
waits
often
on
the
ceremonious
train
of
base
illiterate
wealth
whilst
men
of
schools
shrouded
in
poverty
are
counted
fools
pardon
thou
reverent
german
i
have
mixed
so
slight
a
jest
to
the
fair
entertainment
of
thy
most
worthy
self
for
know
erasmus
mirth
wrinkles
up
my
face
and
i
still
crave
when
that
forsakes
me
i
may
hug
my
grave
erasmus
your
honor
merry
humor
is
best
physic
unto
your
able
body
for
we
learn
where
melancholy
chokes
the
passages
of
blood
and
breath
the
erected
spirit
still
lengthens
our
days
with
sportful
exercise
study
should
be
the
saddest
time
of
life
the
rest
a
sport
exempt
from
thought
of
strife

preacheth
gospel
against

my
noble
poet
surrey
oh
my
lord
you
tax
me
in
that
word
poet
of
much
idleness
it
is
a
study
that
makes
poor
our
fate
poets
were
ever
thought
unfit
for
state
more
o
give
not
up
fair
poesy
sweet
lord
to
such
contempt
that
i
may
speak
my
heart
it
is
the
sweetest
heraldry
of
art
that
sets
a
difference
the
tough
sharp
holly
and
tender
bay
tree
surrey
yet
my
lord
it
is
become
the
very
logic
number
to
all
mechanic
sciences
more
why
i
show
the
reason
this
is
no
age
for
poets
they
should
sing
to
the
loud
canon
heroica
facta
qui
faciunt
reges

as
great

a
play
to
lengthen
out
your

they
say
it
is
the
marriage
of

and
wisdom
a
theme
of
some
import
how
ere
it
prove
but
if
art
fail
we
inch
it
out
with
enter
a
servant
what
are
they
ready
servant
my
lord
one
of
the
players
craves
to
speak
with
you
more
with
me
where
is
he
enter
inclination
the
vice
ready
inclination
here
my
lord
more
how
now
what
the
matter
inclination
we
would
desire
your
honor
but
to
stay
a
little
one
of
my
fellows
is
but
run
to
oagles
for
a
long
beard
for
young
wit
and
he
be
here
presently
more
a
long
beard
for
young
wit
why
man
he
may
be
without
a
beard
till
he
come
to
marriage
for
wit
goes
not
all
by
the
hair
when
comes
wit
in
inclination
in
the
second
scene
next
to
the
prologue
my
lord
more
why
play
on
till
that
scene
come
and
by
that
time
wit
beard
will
be
grown
or
else
the
fellow
returned
with
it
and
what
part
playest
thou
inclination
inclination
the
vice
my
lord
more
gramercies
now
i
may
take
the
vice
if
i
list
and
wherefore
hast
thou
that
bridle
in
thy
hand
inclination
i
must
be
bridled
anon
my
lord
more
and
thou
beest
not
saddled
too
it
makes
no
matter
for
then
inclination
may
gallop
so
fast
that
he
will
outstrip
wisdom
and
fall
to
folly
inclination
indeed
so
he
does
to
lady
vanity
but
we
have
no
folly
in
our
play
more
then
there
no
wit
in
i
be
sworn
folly
waits
on
wit
as
the
shadow
on
the
body
and
where
wit
is
ripest
there
folly
still
is
readiest
but
begin
i
prithee
we
rather
allow
a
beardless
wit
than
wit
all
beard
to
have
no
brain
inclination
nay
he
has
his
apparel
on
too
my
lord
and
therefore
he
is
the
readier
to
enter
more
then
good
inclination
begin
at
a
exit
inclination
my
lord
mayor
wit
lacks
a
beard
or
else
they
would
begin
i
lend
him
mine
but
that
it
is
too
thin
silence
they
come
the
trumpet
sounds
enter
the
prologue
prologue
now
for
as
much
as
in
these
latter
days
throughout
the
whole
world
in
every
land
vice
doth
increase
and
virtue
decays
iniquity
having
the
upper
hand
we
therefore
intend
good
gentle
audience
a
pretty
short
interlude
to
play
at
this
present
desiring
your
leave
and
quiet
silence
to
show
the
same
as
is
meet
and
expedient
it
is
called
the
marriage
of
wit
and
wisdom
a
matter
right
pithy
and
pleasing
to
hear
whereof
in
brief
we
will
show
the
whole
sum
but
i
must
be
gone
for
wit
doth
appear
exit
enter
wit
ruffling
and
inclination
the
vice
wit
in
an
arbor
green
asleep
whereas
i
lay
the
birds
sang
sweetly
in
the
midst
of
the
day
i
dreamed
fast
of
mirth
and
play
in
youth
is
pleasure
in
youth
is
pleasure
methought
i
walked
still
to
and
fro
and
from
her
company
i
could
not
go
but
when
i
waked
it
was
not
so
in
youth
is
pleasure
in
youth
is
pleasure
therefore
my
heart
is
surely
plight
of
her
alone
to
have
a
sight
which
is
my
joy
and
heart
delight
in
youth
is
pleasure
in
youth

pleasure
more

that
time

to
the
commodity

what
time
of
day
clerk
past

wonder

my
good
lord

doth
stay
so

considering
there
matters
of
high
importance
to
be
scanned
upon
surrey
clerk

oh
serious
square
they
sit
upon
this
little
board
is
daily
scanned
the
health
and
preservation
of
the
land
we
the
physicians
that
effect
this
good
now
by
choice
diet
anon
by
letting
blood
our
toil
and
careful
watching
brings
the
king
in
league
with
slumbers
to
which
peace
doth
avoid
the
room
there
what
business
lords
today
shrewsbury
this
my
good
lord
about
the
entertainment
of
the
emperor
gainst
the
perfidious
french
into
our
pay
surrey
my
lords
as
tis
the
custom
in
this
place
the
youngest
should
speak
first
so
if
i
chance
in
this
case
to
speak
youngly
pardon
me
i
will
agree
france
now
hath
her
full
strength
as
having
new
recovered
the
pale
blood
which
war
sluiced
forth
and
i
consent
to
this
that
the
conjunction
of
our
english
forces
with
arms
of
germany
may
soon
bring
this
prize
of
conquest
in
but
then
my
lords
as
in
the
moral
hunting
twixt
the
lion
and
other
beasts
force
joined
with
greed
frighted
the
weaker
sharers
from
their
parts
so
if
the
empire
sovereign
chance
to
put
his
plea
of
partnership
into
war
court
swords
should
decide
the
difference
and
our
blood
in
private
tears
lament
his
entertainment
shrewsbury
to
doubt
the
worst
is
still
the
wise
man
shield
that
arms
him
safely
but
the
world
knows
this
the
emperor
is
a
man
of
royal
faith
his
love
unto
our
sovereign
brings
him
down
from
his
imperial
seat
to
march
in
pay
under
our
english
flag
and
wear
the
cross
like
some
high
order
on
his
manly
breast
thus
serving
he
not
master
of
himself
but
like
a
colonel
commanding
other
is
by
the
general
himself
rochester
yet
my
good
lord
shrewsbury
let
me
conclude
my
speech
as
subjects
share
no
portion
in
the
conquest
of
their
true
sovereign
other
than
the
merit
that
from
the
sovereign
guerdons
the
true
subject
so
the
good
emperor
in
a
friendly
league
of
amity
with
england
will
not
soil
his
honor
with
the
theft
of
english
spoil
more
there
is
no
question
but
this
entertainment
will
be
most
honorable
most
commodious
i
have
oft
heard
good
captains
wish
to
have
rich
soldiers
to
attend
them
such
as
would
fight
both
for
their
lives
and
livings
such
a
one
is
the
good
emperor
i
would
to
god
we
had
ten
thousand
of
such
able
men
hah
then
there
would
appear
no
court

city

where
the
wars

would
pay
themselves

the
strangest
dream
that
ere
my
sleep
was
troubled
with
me
thought
twas
night
and
that
the
king
and
queen
went
on
the
thames
in
barges
to
hear
music
my
lord
and
i
were
in
a
little
boat
me
thought
lord
lord
what
strange
things
live
in
slumbers
and
being
near
we
grappled
to
the
barge
that
bare
the
king
but
after
many
pleasing
voices
spent
in
that
still
moving
music
house
me
though
the
violence
of
the
stream
did
sever
us
quite
from
the
golden
fleet
and
hurried
us
unto
the
bridge
which
with
unused
horror
we
entered
at
full
tide
thence
some
slight
shoot
being
carried
by
the
waves
our
boat
stood
still
just
opposite
the
tower
and
there
it
turned
and
turned
about
as
when
a
sucks
the
circled
waters
me
thought
that
we
both
cried
till
that
we
sunk
where
arm
in
arm
we
died
roper

no
respect

dreams

slight
illusions

you

let
now
survey
our
state
here
sits
my

and
dear
esteemed

yonder
stand
my
loving

now
the
difference
twixt
those
and
these
now
you
shall
hear
my
speak
like
more
in
melancholy
i
conceive
that
nature
hath
sundry
metals
out
of
which
she
frames
us
mortals
each
in
valuation
outprizing
other
of
the
finest
stuff
the
finest
features
come
the
rest
of
earth
receive
base
fortune
even
before
their
birth
hence
slaves
have
their
creation
and
i
think
nature
provides
content
for
the
base
mind
under
the
whip
the
burden
and
the
toil
their
bodies
drudge
in
patience
as
for
the
prince
in
all
his
maw
and
his
rank
flesh
that
sinfully
renews
the
noon
excess
in
the
night
dangerous
surfeits
what
means
or
misery
from
our
birth
doth
flow
nature
entitles
to
us
that
we
owe
but
we
being
subject
to
the
rack
of
hate
falling
from
happy
life
to
bondage
state
having
seen
better
days
now
know
the
lack
of
glory
that
once
reared
each
back
but
you
that
in
your
age
did
view
better
challenged
not
fortune
for
your
thriftless
debter
catesby
sir
we
have
seen
far
better
days
than
these
more
i
was
the
patron
of
those
days
and
know
those
were
but
painted
days
only

hath
bestown
twenty
nobles
the
best
and
worst
together
all
alike
which
master
catesby
here
forth
will
pay
ye

take
it
as
it
is
meant
a
kind
remembrance
of
a
fair
kinder
lord
with
whose
sad
fall
he
gives
up
house
and
farewell
to
us
all

sir
thomas

that

this
while

been
lord
chancellor
more
say
ye
so
master
lieutenant
what
do
ye
think
a
man
that

purchase
lieutenant
perhaps
my
lord
two
thousand
pound
a
year
more
master
lieutenant
i
protest
to
you
i
never
had
the
means
in
all
my
life
to
purchase
one
poor
hundred
pound
a
year
i
think
i
am
the
poorest
chancellor
that
ever
was
in
england
though
i
could
wish
for
credit
of
the
place
that
my
estate
were
better
lieutenant
it
very
strange
more
it
will
be
found
as
true
i
think
sir
that
with
most
part
of
my
coin
i
have
purchased
as
strange
commodities
as
ever
you
heard
tell
of
in
your
life
lieutenant
commodities
my
lord
might
i
without
offence
enquire
of
them
more
croutches
master
lieutenant
and
bare
cloaks
for
halting
soldiers
and
poor
needy
scholars
have
had
my
gettings
in
the
chancery
to
think
but
what
a
cheat
the
crown
shall
have
by
my
attainder
i
prithee
if
thou
beest
a
gentleman
get
but
a
copy
of
my
inventory
that
part
of
poet
that
was
given
me
made
me
a
very
unthrift
for
this
is
the
disease
attends
us
all
poets
were
never
thrifty
never
shall
enter

none
of

here
i
can

you

bad
voice
to
act
this
last
scene
of
my
tragedy
i
send

for
my
trespass

somewhat
bald
for
it
is
not
requisite

head
should
stand
covered
to
so
high
majesty
if
that
content
him
not
because
