i
once
upon
a
time
the
queen
of
fairyland
finding
her
own
subjects
far
too
to
be
amusing
took
a
sudden
longing
to
have
a
mortal
or
two
at
her
court
so
after
looking
about
her
for
some
time
she
fixed
upon
two
to
bring
to
fairyland
but
how
were
they
to
be
brought
please
your
majesty
said
at
last
the
daughter
of
the
i
will
bring
the
girl
the
speaker
whose
name
was
peaseblossom
after
her
looked
so
graceful
and
hung
her
head
so
apologetically
that
the
queen
said
at
once
how
will
you
manage
it
peaseblossom
i
will
open
the
road
before
her
and
close
it
behind
her
i
have
heard
that
you
have
pretty
ways
of
doing
things
so
you
may
try
the
court
happened
to
be
held
in
an
open
of
smooth
turf
upon
which
there
was
just
one
as
soon
as
the
queen
had
given
her
permission
to
peaseblossom
up
through
the
came
the
head
of
a
goblin
which
cried
out
please
your
majesty
i
will
bring
the
boy
you
exclaimed
the
queen
how
will
you
do
it
the
goblin
began
to
wriggle
himself
out
of
the
earth
as
if
he
had
been
a
snake
and
the
whole
world
his
skin
till
the
court
was
convulsed
with
laughter
as
soon
as
he
got
free
he
began
to
roll
over
and
over
in
every
possible
manner
rotatory
and
cylindrical
all
at
once
until
he
reached
the
wood
the
courtiers
followed
holding
their
sides
so
that
the
queen
was
left
sitting
upon
her
throne
in
solitary
state
when
they
reached
the
wood
the
goblin
whose
name
was
toadstool
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
while
they
were
looking
for
him
out
popped
his
head
from
the
again
with
the
words
so
your
majesty
you
have
taken
your
own
time
to
answer
said
the
queen
laughing
and
my
own
way
too
eh
your
majesty
rejoined
toadstool
grinning
no
doubt
well
you
may
try
and
the
goblin
making
as
much
of
a
bow
as
he
could
with
only
half
his
neck
above
ground
disappeared
under
it
chapter
ii
no
mortal
or
fairy
either
can
tell
where
fairyland
begins
and
where
it
ends
but
somewhere
on
the
borders
of
fairyland
there
was
a
nice
country
village
in
which
lived
some
nice
country
people
alice
was
the
daughter
of
the
squire
a
pretty
girl
whom
her
friends
called
and
others
called
silly
one
rosy
summer
evening
when
the
wall
opposite
her
window
was
flaked
all
over
with
rosiness
she
threw
herself
down
on
her
bed
and
lay
gazing
at
the
wall
the
sank
through
her
eyes
and
dyed
her
brain
and
she
began
to
feel
as
if
she
were
reading
a
she
thought
she
was
looking
at
a
western
sea
with
the
waves
all
red
with
sunset
but
when
the
colour
died
out
alice
gave
a
sigh
to
see
how
commonplace
the
wall
grew
i
wish
it
was
always
sunset
she
said
half
aloud
i
do
like
gray
things
i
will
take
you
where
the
sun
is
always
setting
if
you
like
alice
said
a
sweet
tiny
voice
near
her
she
looked
down
on
the
coverlet
of
the
bed
and
there
looking
up
at
her
stood
a
lovely
little
creature
it
seemed
quite
natural
that
the
little
lady
should
be
there
for
many
things
we
never
could
believe
have
only
to
happen
and
then
there
is
nothing
strange
about
them
she
was
dressed
in
white
with
a
cloak
of
the
colours
of
the
sweetest
of
on
her
head
was
a
crown
of
twisted
tendrils
with
a
little
gold
beetle
in
front
are
you
a
fairy
said
alice
yes
will
you
go
with
me
to
the
sunset
yes
i
will
when
alice
proceeded
to
rise
she
found
that
she
was
no
bigger
than
the
fairy
and
when
she
stood
up
on
the
counterpane
the
bed
looked
like
a
great
hall
with
a
painted
ceiling
as
she
walked
towards
peaseblossom
she
stumbled
several
times
over
the
tufts
that
made
the
pattern
but
the
fairy
took
her
by
the
hand
and
led
her
towards
the
foot
of
the
bed
long
before
they
reached
it
however
alice
saw
that
the
fairy
was
a
tall
slender
lady
and
that
she
herself
was
quite
her
own
size
what
she
had
taken
for
tufts
on
the
counterpane
were
really
bushes
of
furze
and
broom
and
heather
on
the
side
of
a
slope
where
are
we
asked
alice
going
on
answered
the
fairy
alice
not
liking
the
reply
said
i
want
to
go
home
then
answered
the
fairy
alice
looked
round
a
wide
hilly
country
lay
all
about
them
she
could
not
even
tell
from
what
quarter
they
had
come
i
must
go
with
you
i
see
she
said
before
they
reached
the
bottom
they
were
walking
over
the
loveliest
a
little
stream
went
cantering
down
beside
them
without
channel
or
bank
sometimes
running
between
the
blades
sometimes
sweeping
the
grass
all
one
way
under
it
and
it
made
a
great
babbling
for
such
a
little
stream
and
such
a
smooth
course
gradually
the
slope
grew
gentler
and
the
stream
flowed
more
softly
and
spread
out
wider
at
length
they
came
to
a
wood
of
long
straight
poplars
growing
out
of
the
water
for
the
stream
ran
into
the
wood
and
there
stretched
out
into
a
lake
alice
thought
they
could
go
no
farther
but
peaseblossom
led
her
straight
on
and
they
walked
through
it
was
now
dark
but
everything
under
the
water
gave
out
a
pale
quiet
light
there
were
deep
pools
here
and
there
but
there
was
no
mud
or
frogs
or
or
eels
all
the
bottom
was
pure
lovely
grass
brilliantly
green
down
the
banks
of
the
pools
she
saw
all
under
water
primroses
and
violets
and
pimpernels
any
flower
she
wished
to
see
she
had
only
to
look
for
and
she
was
sure
to
find
it
when
a
pool
came
in
their
way
the
fairy
swam
and
alice
swam
by
her
and
when
they
got
out
they
were
quite
dry
though
the
water
was
as
delightfully
wet
as
water
should
be
besides
the
trees
tall
splendid
lilies
grew
out
of
it
and
hollyhocks
and
irises
and
and
many
other
flowers
from
every
leaf
and
petal
of
these
from
every
and
tendril
dropped
bright
water
it
gathered
slowly
at
each
point
but
the
points
were
so
many
that
there
was
a
constant
musical
plashing
of
diamond
rain
upon
the
still
surface
of
the
lake
as
they
went
on
the
moon
rose
and
threw
a
pale
mist
of
light
over
the
whole
and
the
diamond
drops
turned
to
pearls
and
round
every
was
a
halo
of
moonlight
and
the
water
went
to
sleep
and
the
flowers
began
to
dream
look
said
the
fairy
those
lilies
are
just
dreaming
themselves
into
a
child
sleep
i
can
see
them
smiling
this
is
the
place
out
of
which
go
the
things
that
appear
to
children
every
night
is
this
dreamland
then
asked
alice
if
you
like
answered
the
fairy
how
far
am
i
from
home
the
farther
you
go
the
nearer
home
you
are
then
the
fairy
lady
gathered
a
bundle
of
poppies
and
gave
it
to
alice
the
next
deep
pool
that
they
came
to
she
told
her
to
throw
it
in
alice
did
so
and
following
it
laid
her
head
upon
it
that
moment
she
began
to
sink
down
and
down
she
went
till
at
last
she
felt
herself
lying
on
the
long
thick
grass
at
the
bottom
of
the
pool
with
the
poppies
under
her
head
and
the
clear
water
high
over
it
up
through
it
she
saw
the
moon
whose
bright
face
looked
sleepy
too
disturbed
only
by
the
little
ripples
of
the
rain
from
the
tall
flowers
on
the
edges
of
the
pool
she
fell
fast
asleep
and
all
night
dreamed
about
home
chapter
iii
richard
which
is
name
enough
for
a
fairy
story
was
the
son
of
a
widow
in
alice
village
he
was
so
poor
that
he
did
not
find
himself
generally
welcome
so
he
hardly
went
anywhere
but
read
books
at
home
and
waited
upon
his
mother
his
manners
therefore
were
shy
and
sufficiently
awkward
to
give
an
unfavourable
impression
to
those
who
looked
at
outsides
alice
would
have
despised
him
but
he
never
came
near
enough
for
that
now
richard
had
been
saving
up
his
few
pence
in
order
to
buy
an
umbrella
for
his
mother
for
the
winter
would
come
and
the
one
she
had
was
almost
torn
to
ribands
one
bright
summer
evening
when
he
thought
umbrellas
must
be
cheap
he
was
walking
across
the
to
buy
one
there
in
the
middle
of
it
stood
an
little
man
actually
selling
umbrellas
here
was
a
chance
for
him
when
he
drew
nearer
he
found
that
the
little
man
while
vaunting
his
umbrellas
to
the
skies
was
asking
such
absurdly
small
prices
for
them
that
no
one
would
venture
to
buy
one
he
had
opened
and
laid
them
all
out
at
full
stretch
on
the
about
of
them
stick
downwards
like
little
tents
and
he
stood
beside
haranguing
the
people
but
he
would
not
allow
one
of
the
crowd
to
touch
his
umbrellas
as
soon
as
his
eye
fell
upon
richard
he
changed
his
tone
and
said
well
as
nobody
seems
inclined
to
buy
i
think
my
dear
umbrellas
we
had
better
be
going
home
whereupon
the
umbrellas
got
up
with
some
difficulty
and
began
hobbling
away
the
people
stared
at
each
other
with
open
mouths
for
they
saw
that
what
they
had
taken
for
a
lot
of
umbrellas
was
in
reality
a
flock
of
black
geese
a
great
went
gobbling
behind
them
driving
them
all
down
a
lane
towards
the
forest
richard
thought
with
himself
there
is
more
in
this
than
i
can
account
for
but
an
umbrella
that
could
lay
eggs
would
be
a
very
jolly
umbrella
so
by
the
time
the
people
were
beginning
to
laugh
at
each
other
richard
was
down
the
lane
at
the
heels
of
the
geese
there
he
stooped
and
caught
one
of
them
but
instead
of
a
goose
he
had
a
huge
hedgehog
in
his
hands
which
he
dropped
in
dismay
whereupon
it
waddled
away
a
goose
as
before
and
the
whole
of
them
began
cackling
and
hissing
in
a
way
that
he
could
not
mistake
for
the
he
gobbled
and
gabbled
and
choked
himself
and
got
right
again
in
the
most
ridiculous
manner
in
fact
he
seemed
sometimes
to
forget
that
he
was
a
turkey
and
laughed
like
a
fool
all
at
once
with
a
simultaneous
hiss
they
flew
into
the
wood
and
the
turkey
after
them
but
richard
soon
got
up
with
them
again
and
found
them
all
hanging
by
their
feet
from
the
trees
in
two
rows
one
on
each
side
of
the
path
while
the
turkey
was
walking
on
him
richard
followed
but
the
moment
he
reached
the
middle
of
the
suspended
geese
from
every
side
arose
the
most
frightful
hisses
and
their
necks
grew
longer
and
longer
till
there
were
nearly
thirty
broad
bills
close
to
his
head
blowing
in
his
face
in
his
ears
and
at
the
back
of
his
neck
but
the
turkey
looking
round
and
seeing
what
was
going
on
turned
and
walked
back
when
he
reached
the
place
he
looked
up
at
the
first
and
gobbled
at
him
in
the
wildest
manner
that
goose
grew
silent
and
dropped
from
the
tree
then
he
went
to
the
next
and
the
next
and
so
on
till
he
had
gobbled
them
all
off
the
trees
one
after
another
but
when
richard
expected
to
see
them
go
after
the
turkey
there
was
nothing
there
but
a
flock
of
huge
mushrooms
and
i
have
had
enough
of
this
thought
richard
i
will
go
home
again
go
home
richard
said
a
voice
close
to
him
looking
down
he
saw
instead
of
the
turkey
the
most
little
man
he
had
ever
seen
go
home
master
richard
repeated
he
grinning
not
for
your
bidding
answered
richard
come
on
then
master
richard
nor
that
either
without
a
good
reason
i
will
give
you
an
umbrella
for
your
mother
i
do
take
presents
from
strangers
bless
you
i
no
stranger
here
oh
no
not
at
all
and
he
set
off
in
the
manner
usual
with
him
rolling
every
way
at
once
richard
could
not
help
laughing
and
following
at
length
toadstool
plumped
into
a
great
hole
full
of
water
served
him
right
thought
richard
served
him
right
bawled
the
goblin
crawling
out
again
and
shaking
the
water
from
him
like
a
spaniel
this
is
the
very
place
i
wanted
only
i
rolled
too
fast
however
he
went
on
rolling
again
faster
than
before
though
it
was
now
uphill
till
he
came
to
the
top
of
a
considerable
height
on
which
grew
a
number
of
have
you
a
knife
richard
said
the
goblin
stopping
all
at
once
as
if
he
had
been
walking
quietly
along
just
like
other
people
richard
pulled
out
a
and
gave
it
to
the
creature
who
instantly
cut
a
deep
gash
in
one
of
the
trees
then
he
bounded
to
another
and
did
the
same
and
so
on
till
he
had
gashed
them
all
richard
following
him
saw
that
a
little
stream
clearer
than
the
clearest
water
began
to
flow
from
each
increasing
in
size
the
longer
it
flowed
before
he
had
reached
the
last
there
was
quite
a
tinkling
and
rustling
of
the
little
rills
that
ran
down
the
stems
of
the
palms
this
grew
and
grew
till
richard
saw
that
a
full
rivulet
was
flowing
down
the
side
of
the
hill
here
is
your
knife
richard
said
the
goblin
but
by
the
time
he
had
put
it
in
his
pocket
the
rivulet
had
grown
to
a
small
torrent
now
richard
come
along
said
toadstool
and
threw
himself
into
the
torrent
i
would
rather
have
a
boat
returned
richard
oh
you
stupid
cried
toadstool
crawling
up
the
side
of
the
hill
down
which
the
stream
had
already
carried
him
some
distance
with
every
contortion
that
labour
and
difficulty
could
suggest
yet
with
incredible
rapidity
he
crawled
to
the
very
top
of
one
of
the
trees
and
tore
down
a
huge
leaf
which
he
threw
on
the
ground
and
himself
after
it
rebounding
like
a
ball
he
then
laid
the
leaf
on
the
water
held
it
by
the
stem
and
told
richard
to
get
upon
it
he
did
so
it
went
down
deep
in
the
middle
with
his
weight
toadstool
let
it
go
and
it
shot
down
the
stream
like
an
arrow
this
began
the
strangest
and
most
delightful
voyage
the
stream
rushed
careering
and
curveting
down
the
bright
as
a
diamond
and
soon
reached
a
meadow
plain
the
goblin
rolled
alongside
of
the
boat
like
a
bundle
of
weeds
but
richard
rode
in
triumph
through
the
low
grassy
country
upon
the
back
of
his
watery
steed
it
went
straight
as
an
arrow
and
strange
to
tell
was
heaped
up
on
the
ground
like
a
ridge
of
water
or
a
wave
only
rushing
on
endways
it
needed
no
channel
and
turned
aside
for
no
opposition
it
flowed
over
everything
that
crossed
its
path
like
a
great
serpent
of
water
with
folds
fitting
into
all
the
ups
and
downs
of
the
way
if
a
wall
came
in
its
course
it
flowed
against
it
heaping
itself
up
on
itself
till
it
reached
the
top
whence
it
plunged
to
the
foot
on
the
other
side
and
flowed
on
soon
he
found
that
it
was
running
gently
up
a
grassy
hill
the
waves
kept
curling
back
as
if
the
wind
blew
them
or
as
if
they
could
hardly
keep
from
running
down
again
but
still
the
stream
mounted
and
flowed
and
the
waves
with
it
it
found
it
difficult
but
it
could
do
it
when
they
reached
the
top
it
bore
them
across
a
heathy
country
rolling
over
purple
heather
and
blue
harebells
and
delicate
ferns
and
tall
foxgloves
crowded
with
bells
purple
and
white
all
the
time
the
curled
its
edges
away
from
the
water
and
made
a
delightful
boat
for
richard
while
toadstool
tumbled
along
in
the
stream
like
a
porpoise
at
length
the
water
began
to
run
very
fast
and
went
faster
and
faster
till
suddenly
it
plunged
them
into
a
deep
lake
with
a
great
splash
and
stopped
there
toadstool
went
out
of
sight
and
came
up
gasping
and
grinning
while
richard
boat
tossed
and
heaved
like
a
vessel
in
a
storm
at
sea
but
not
a
drop
of
water
came
in
then
the
goblin
began
to
swim
and
pushed
and
tugged
the
boat
along
but
the
lake
was
so
still
and
the
motion
so
pleasant
that
richard
fell
fast
asleep
chapter
iv
when
he
woke
he
found
himself
still
afloat
upon
the
broad
he
was
alone
in
the
middle
of
a
lake
with
flowers
and
trees
growing
in
and
out
of
it
everywhere
the
sun
was
just
over
the
a
drip
of
water
from
the
flowers
greeted
him
with
music
the
mists
were
dissolving
away
and
where
the
sunlight
fell
on
the
lake
the
water
was
clear
as
glass
casting
his
eyes
downward
he
saw
just
beneath
him
far
down
at
the
bottom
alice
drowned
as
he
thought
he
was
in
the
act
of
plunging
in
when
he
saw
her
open
her
eyes
and
at
the
same
moment
begin
to
float
up
he
held
out
his
hand
but
she
repelled
it
with
disdain
and
swimming
to
a
tree
sat
down
on
a
low
branch
wondering
how
ever
the
poor
widow
son
could
have
found
his
way
into
fairyland
she
did
not
like
it
it
was
an
invasion
of
privilege
how
did
you
come
here
young
richard
she
asked
from
six
yards
off
a
goblin
brought
me
ah
i
thought
so
a
fairy
brought
me
where
is
your
fairy
here
i
am
said
peaseblossom
rising
slowly
to
the
surface
just
by
the
tree
on
which
alice
was
seated
where
is
your
goblin
retorted
alice
here
i
am
bawled
toadstool
rushing
out
of
the
water
like
a
salmon
and
casting
a
summersault
in
the
air
before
he
fell
in
again
with
a
tremendous
splash
his
head
rose
again
close
beside
peaseblossom
who
being
used
to
such
creatures
only
laughed
is
he
handsome
he
grinned
yes
very
he
wants
polishing
though
you
could
do
that
for
yourself
you
know
shall
we
change
i
do
mind
you
find
her
rather
silly
that
nothing
the
boy
too
sensible
for
me
he
dived
and
rose
at
alice
feet
she
shrieked
with
terror
the
fairy
floated
away
like
a
towards
richard
what
a
lovely
creature
thought
he
but
hearing
alice
shriek
again
he
said
do
leave
alice
she
frightened
at
that
queer
i
think
there
any
harm
in
him
though
alice
oh
no
he
wo
hurt
her
said
peaseblossom
i
tired
of
her
going
to
take
her
to
the
court
and
i
will
take
you
i
do
want
to
go
but
you
must
you
ca
go
home
again
you
do
know
the
way
richard
richard
cried
alice
in
an
agony
richard
sprang
from
his
boat
and
was
by
her
side
in
a
moment
he
pinched
me
cried
alice
richard
hit
the
goblin
a
terrible
blow
on
the
head
but
it
took
no
more
effect
upon
him
than
if
his
head
had
been
a
round
ball
of
he
gave
richard
a
furious
look
however
and
bawling
out
repent
that
dick
vanished
under
the
water
come
along
richard
make
haste
he
will
murder
you
cried
the
fairy
it
is
all
your
fault
said
richard
i
wo
leave
alice
then
the
fairy
saw
it
was
all
over
with
her
and
toadstool
for
they
can
do
nothing
with
mortals
against
their
will
so
she
floated
away
across
the
water
in
richard
boat
holding
her
robe
for
a
sail
and
vanished
leaving
the
two
alone
in
the
lake
you
have
driven
away
my
fairy
cried
alice
i
shall
never
get
home
now
it
is
all
your
fault
you
naughty
young
man
i
drove
away
the
goblin
remonstrated
richard
will
you
please
to
sit
on
the
other
side
of
the
tree
i
wonder
what
my
papa
would
say
if
he
saw
me
talking
to
you
will
you
come
to
the
next
tree
alice
said
richard
after
a
pause
alice
who
had
been
crying
all
the
time
that
richard
was
thinking
said
i
wo
richard
therefore
plunged
into
the
water
without
her
and
swam
for
the
tree
before
he
had
got
however
he
heard
alice
crying
richard
richard
this
was
just
what
he
wanted
so
he
turned
back
and
alice
threw
herself
into
the
water
with
richard
help
she
swam
pretty
well
and
they
reached
the
tree
now
for
the
next
said
richard
and
they
swam
to
the
next
and
then
to
the
third
every
tree
they
reached
was
larger
than
the
last
and
every
tree
before
them
was
larger
still
so
they
swam
from
tree
to
tree
till
they
came
to
one
that
was
so
large
that
they
could
not
see
round
it
what
was
to
be
done
clearly
to
climb
this
tree
it
was
a
dreadful
prospect
for
alice
but
richard
proceeded
to
climb
and
by
putting
her
feet
where
he
put
his
and
now
and
then
getting
hold
of
his
ankle
she
managed
to
make
her
way
up
there
were
a
great
many
stumps
where
branches
had
withered
off
and
the
bark
was
nearly
as
rough
as
a
so
there
was
plenty
of
foothold
for
them
when
they
had
climbed
a
long
time
and
were
getting
very
tired
indeed
alice
cried
out
richard
i
shall
drop
i
shall
why
did
you
come
this
way
and
she
began
once
more
to
cry
but
at
that
moment
richard
caught
hold
of
a
branch
above
his
head
and
reaching
down
his
other
hand
got
hold
of
alice
and
held
her
till
she
had
recovered
a
little
in
a
few
moments
more
they
reached
the
fork
of
the
tree
and
there
they
sat
and
rested
this
is
capital
said
richard
cheerily
what
is
asked
alice
sulkily
why
we
have
room
to
rest
and
there
no
hurry
for
a
minute
or
two
i
tired
you
selfish
creature
said
alice
if
you
are
tired
what
must
i
be
tired
too
answered
richard
but
we
got
on
bravely
and
look
what
that
by
this
time
the
day
was
gone
and
the
night
so
near
that
in
the
shadows
of
the
tree
all
was
dusky
and
dim
but
there
was
still
light
enough
to
discover
that
in
a
niche
of
the
tree
sat
a
huge
horned
owl
with
green
spectacles
on
his
beak
and
a
book
in
one
foot
he
took
no
heed
of
the
intruders
but
kept
muttering
to
himself
and
what
do
you
think
the
owl
was
saying
i
will
tell
you
he
was
talking
about
the
book
that
he
held
upside
down
in
his
foot
stupid
book
nothing
in
it
at
all
everything
upside
down
stupid
says
owls
ca
read
can
read
backwards
i
think
that
is
the
goblin
again
said
richard
in
a
whisper
however
if
you
ask
a
plain
question
he
must
give
you
a
plain
answer
for
they
are
not
allowed
to
tell
downright
lies
in
fairyland
do
ask
him
richard
you
know
you
gave
him
a
dreadful
blow
i
gave
him
what
he
deserved
and
he
owes
me
the
hallo
which
is
the
way
out
he
would
say
you
because
then
it
would
not
have
been
a
plain
question
hissed
the
owl
without
ever
lifting
his
eyes
from
the
book
which
all
the
time
he
read
upside
down
so
learned
was
he
on
your
honour
as
a
respectable
old
owl
asked
richard
no
hissed
the
owl
and
richard
was
almost
sure
that
he
was
not
really
an
owl
so
he
stood
staring
at
him
for
a
few
moments
when
all
at
once
without
lifting
his
eyes
from
the
book
the
owl
said
i
will
sing
a
song
and
began
nobody
knows
the
world
but
me
when
they
all
in
bed
i
sit
up
to
see
i
a
better
student
than
students
all
for
i
never
read
till
the
darkness
fall
and
i
never
read
without
my
glasses
and
that
is
how
my
wisdom
passes
howlowlwhoolhoolwoolool
i
can
see
the
wind
now
who
can
do
that
i
see
the
dreams
that
he
has
in
his
hat
i
see
him
snorting
them
out
as
he
goes
out
at
his
stupid
old
ten
thousand
things
that
you
could
think
i
write
them
down
with
pen
and
ink
howlowlwhooloolwhitit
that
wit
you
may
call
it
learning
is
no
one
else
sees
the
sit
on
the
sea
her
nest
all
night
but
the
owl
hatching
the
boats
and
the
fowl
when
the
oysters
gape
to
sing
by
rote
she
crams
a
pearl
down
each
stupid
throat
howlowlwhitit
that
wit
there
a
fowl
and
so
singing
he
threw
the
book
in
richard
face
spread
out
his
great
silent
soft
wings
and
sped
away
into
the
depths
of
the
tree
when
the
book
struck
richard
he
found
that
it
was
only
a
lump
of
wet
moss
while
talking
to
the
owl
he
had
spied
a
hollow
behind
one
of
the
branches
judging
this
to
be
the
way
the
owl
meant
he
went
to
see
and
found
a
rude
staircase
going
down
into
the
very
heart
of
the
trunk
but
so
large
was
the
tree
that
this
could
not
have
hurt
it
in
the
least
down
this
stair
then
richard
scrambled
as
best
he
could
followed
by
alice
not
of
her
own
will
she
gave
him
clearly
to
understand
but
because
she
could
do
no
better
down
down
they
went
slipping
and
falling
sometimes
but
never
very
far
because
the
stair
went
round
and
round
it
caught
richard
when
he
slipped
and
he
caught
alice
when
she
did
they
had
begun
to
fear
that
there
was
no
end
to
the
stair
it
went
round
and
round
so
steadily
when
creeping
through
a
crack
they
found
themselves
in
a
great
hall
supported
by
thousands
of
pillars
of
gray
stone
where
the
little
light
came
from
they
could
not
tell
this
hall
they
began
to
cross
in
a
straight
line
hoping
to
reach
one
side
and
intending
to
walk
along
it
till
they
came
to
some
opening
they
kept
straight
by
going
from
pillar
to
pillar
as
they
had
done
before
by
the
trees
any
honest
plan
will
do
in
fairyland
if
you
only
stick
to
it
and
no
plan
will
do
if
you
do
not
stick
to
it
it
was
very
silent
and
alice
disliked
the
silence
more
than
the
dimness
so
much
indeed
that
she
longed
to
hear
richard
voice
but
she
had
always
been
so
cross
to
him
when
he
had
spoken
that
he
thought
it
better
to
let
her
speak
first
and
she
was
too
proud
to
do
that
she
would
not
even
let
him
walk
alongside
of
her
but
always
went
slower
when
he
wanted
to
wait
for
her
so
that
at
last
he
strode
on
alone
and
alice
followed
but
by
degrees
the
horror
of
silence
grew
upon
her
and
she
felt
at
last
as
if
there
was
no
one
in
the
universe
but
herself
the
hall
went
on
widening
around
her
their
footsteps
made
no
noise
the
silence
grew
so
intense
that
it
seemed
on
the
point
of
taking
shape
at
last
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
she
ran
after
richard
got
up
with
him
and
laid
hold
of
his
arm
he
had
been
thinking
for
some
time
what
an
obstinate
disagreeable
girl
alice
was
and
wishing
he
had
her
safe
home
to
be
rid
of
her
when
feeling
a
hand
and
looking
round
he
saw
that
it
was
the
disagreeable
girl
she
soon
began
to
be
companionable
after
a
fashion
for
she
began
to
think
putting
everything
together
that
richard
must
have
been
several
times
in
fairyland
before
now
it
is
very
strange
she
said
to
herself
for
he
is
quite
a
poor
boy
i
am
sure
of
that
his
arms
stick
out
beyond
his
jacket
like
the
ribs
of
his
mother
umbrella
and
to
think
of
me
wandering
about
fairyland
with
the
moment
she
touched
his
arm
they
saw
an
arch
of
blackness
before
them
they
had
walked
straight
to
a
door
not
a
very
inviting
one
for
it
opened
upon
an
utterly
dark
passage
where
there
was
only
one
door
however
there
was
no
difficulty
about
choosing
richard
walked
straight
through
it
and
from
the
greater
fear
of
being
left
behind
alice
faced
the
lesser
fear
of
going
on
in
a
moment
they
were
in
total
darkness
alice
clung
to
richard
arm
and
murmured
almost
against
her
will
dear
richard
it
was
strange
that
fear
should
speak
like
love
but
it
was
in
fairyland
it
was
strange
too
that
as
soon
as
she
spoke
thus
richard
should
fall
in
love
with
her
all
at
once
but
what
was
more
curious
still
was
that
at
the
same
moment
richard
saw
her
face
in
spite
of
her
fear
which
had
made
her
pale
she
looked
very
lovely
dear
alice
said
richard
how
pale
you
look
how
can
you
tell
that
richard
when
all
is
as
black
as
pitch
i
can
see
your
face
it
gives
out
light
now
i
see
your
hands
now
i
can
see
your
feet
yes
i
can
see
every
spot
where
you
are
going
to
no
do
put
your
foot
there
there
is
an
ugly
toad
just
there
the
fact
was
that
the
moment
he
began
to
love
alice
his
eyes
began
to
send
forth
light
what
he
thought
came
from
alice
face
really
came
from
his
eyes
all
about
her
and
her
path
he
could
see
and
every
minute
saw
better
but
to
his
own
path
he
was
blind
he
could
not
see
his
hand
when
he
held
it
straight
before
his
face
so
dark
was
it
but
he
could
see
alice
and
that
was
better
than
seeing
the
way
ever
so
much
at
length
alice
too
began
to
see
a
face
dawning
through
the
darkness
it
was
richard
face
but
it
was
far
handsomer
than
when
she
saw
it
last
her
eyes
had
begun
to
give
light
too
and
she
said
to
herself
can
it
be
that
i
love
the
poor
widow
son
i
suppose
that
must
be
it
she
answered
herself
with
a
smile
for
she
was
not
disgusted
with
herself
at
all
richard
saw
the
smile
and
was
glad
her
paleness
had
gone
and
a
sweet
rosiness
had
taken
its
place
and
now
she
saw
richard
path
as
he
saw
hers
and
between
the
two
sights
they
got
on
well
they
were
now
walking
on
a
path
betwixt
two
deep
waters
which
never
moved
shining
as
black
as
ebony
where
the
eyelight
fell
but
they
saw
ere
long
that
this
path
kept
growing
narrower
and
narrower
at
last
to
alice
dismay
the
black
waters
met
in
front
of
them
what
is
to
be
done
now
richard
she
said
when
they
fixed
their
eyes
on
the
water
before
them
they
saw
that
it
was
swarming
with
lizards
and
frogs
and
black
snakes
and
all
kinds
of
strange
and
ugly
creatures
especially
some
that
had
neither
heads
nor
tails
nor
legs
nor
fins
nor
feelers
being
in
fact
only
living
lumps
these
kept
jumping
out
and
in
and
sprawling
upon
the
path
richard
thought
for
a
few
moments
before
replying
to
alice
question
as
indeed
well
he
might
but
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
path
could
not
have
gone
on
for
the
sake
of
stopping
there
and
that
it
must
be
a
kind
of
finger
that
pointed
on
where
it
was
not
allowed
to
go
itself
so
he
caught
up
alice
in
his
strong
arms
and
jumped
into
the
middle
of
the
horrid
swarm
and
just
as
minnows
vanish
if
you
throw
anything
amongst
them
just
so
these
wretched
creatures
vanished
right
and
left
and
every
way
he
found
the
water
broader
than
he
had
expected
and
before
he
got
over
he
found
alice
heavier
than
he
could
have
believed
but
upon
a
firm
rocky
bottom
richard
waded
through
in
safety
when
he
reached
the
other
side
he
found
that
the
bank
was
a
lofty
smooth
perpendicular
rock
with
some
rough
steps
cut
in
it
by
and
by
the
steps
led
them
right
into
the
rock
and
they
were
in
a
narrow
passage
once
more
but
this
time
leading
up
it
wound
round
and
round
like
the
thread
of
a
great
screw
at
last
richard
knocked
his
head
against
something
and
could
go
no
farther
the
place
was
close
and
hot
he
put
up
his
hands
and
pushed
what
felt
like
a
warm
stone
it
moved
a
little
go
down
you
brutes
growled
a
voice
above
quivering
with
anger
you
upset
my
pot
and
my
cat
and
my
temper
too
if
you
push
that
way
go
down
richard
knocked
very
gently
and
said
please
let
us
out
oh
yes
i
dare
say
very
fine
and
go
down
you
goblin
brutes
i
had
enough
of
you
i
scald
the
hair
off
your
ugly
heads
if
you
do
that
again
go
down
i
say
seeing
fair
speech
was
of
no
avail
richard
told
alice
to
go
down
a
little
out
of
the
way
and
setting
his
shoulders
to
one
end
of
the
stone
heaved
it
up
whereupon
down
came
the
other
end
with
a
pot
and
a
fire
and
a
cat
which
had
been
asleep
beside
it
she
frightened
alice
dreadfully
as
she
rushed
past
her
showing
nothing
but
her
green
lamping
eyes
richard
peeping
up
found
that
he
had
turned
a
upside
down
on
the
edge
of
the
hole
stood
a
little
crooked
old
man
brandishing
a
in
a
tremendous
rage
and
hesitating
only
where
to
strike
him
but
richard
put
him
out
of
his
difficulty
by
springing
up
and
taking
the
stick
from
him
then
having
lifted
alice
out
he
returned
it
with
a
bow
and
heedless
of
the
maledictions
of
the
old
man
proceeded
to
get
the
stone
and
the
pot
up
again
for
puss
she
got
out
of
herself
then
the
old
man
became
a
little
more
friendly
and
said
i
beg
your
pardon
i
thought
you
were
goblins
they
never
will
let
me
alone
but
you
must
allow
it
was
rather
an
unusual
way
of
paying
a
morning
call
and
the
creature
bowed
conciliatingly
it
was
indeed
answered
richard
i
wish
you
had
turned
the
door
to
us
instead
of
the
for
he
did
not
trust
the
old
man
but
he
added
i
hope
you
will
forgive
us
oh
certainly
certainly
my
dear
young
people
use
your
freedom
but
such
young
people
have
no
business
to
be
out
alone
it
is
against
the
rules
but
what
is
one
to
do
i
mean
two
to
do
when
they
ca
help
it
yes
yes
of
course
but
now
you
know
i
must
take
charge
of
you
so
you
sit
there
young
gentleman
and
you
sit
there
young
lady
he
put
a
chair
for
one
at
one
side
of
the
hearth
and
for
the
other
at
the
other
side
and
then
drew
his
chair
between
them
the
cat
got
upon
his
hump
and
then
set
up
her
own
so
here
was
a
wall
that
would
let
through
no
moonshine
but
although
both
richard
and
alice
were
very
much
amused
they
did
not
like
to
be
parted
in
this
peremptory
manner
still
they
thought
it
better
not
to
anger
the
old
man
any
more
in
his
own
house
too
but
he
had
been
once
angered
and
that
was
once
too
often
for
he
had
made
it
a
rule
never
to
forgive
without
taking
it
out
in
humiliation
it
was
so
disagreeable
to
have
him
sitting
there
between
them
that
they
felt
as
if
they
were
far
asunder
in
order
to
get
the
better
of
the
fancy
they
wanted
to
hold
each
other
hand
behind
the
back
but
the
moment
their
hands
began
to
approach
the
back
of
the
cat
began
to
grow
long
and
its
hump
to
grow
high
and
in
a
moment
more
richard
found
himself
crawling
wearily
up
a
steep
hill
whose
ridge
rose
against
the
stars
while
a
cold
wind
blew
drearily
over
it
not
a
habitation
was
in
sight
and
alice
had
vanished
from
his
eyes
he
felt
however
that
she
must
be
somewhere
on
the
other
side
and
so
climbed
and
climbed
to
get
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
down
to
where
he
thought
she
must
be
but
the
longer
he
climbed
the
farther
off
the
top
of
the
hill
seemed
till
at
last
he
sank
quite
exhausted
and
must
i
confess
it
very
nearly
began
to
cry
to
think
of
being
separated
from
alice
all
at
once
and
in
such
a
disagreeable
way
but
he
fell
instead
and
soon
said
to
himself
this
must
be
some
trick
of
that
wretched
old
man
either
this
mountain
is
a
cat
or
it
is
not
if
it
is
a
mountain
this
wo
hurt
it
if
it
is
a
cat
i
hope
it
will
with
that
he
pulled
out
his
and
feeling
for
a
soft
place
drove
it
at
one
blow
up
to
the
handle
in
the
side
of
the
mountain
a
terrific
shriek
was
the
first
result
and
the
second
that
alice
and
he
sat
looking
at
each
other
across
the
old
man
hump
from
which
the
had
vanished
their
host
sat
staring
at
the
blank
fireplace
without
ever
turning
round
pretending
to
know
nothing
of
what
had
taken
place
come
along
alice
said
richard
rising
this
wo
do
we
stop
here
alice
rose
at
once
and
put
her
hand
in
his
they
walked
towards
the
door
the
old
man
took
no
notice
of
them
the
moon
was
shining
brightly
through
the
window
but
instead
of
stepping
out
into
the
moonlight
when
they
opened
the
door
they
stepped
into
a
great
beautiful
hall
through
the
high
gothic
windows
of
which
the
same
moon
was
shining
out
of
this
hall
they
could
find
no
way
except
by
a
staircase
of
stone
which
led
upwards
they
ascended
it
together
at
the
top
alice
let
go
hand
to
peep
into
a
little
room
which
looked
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
just
like
the
inside
of
a
diamond
richard
went
a
step
or
two
along
a
corridor
but
finding
she
had
left
him
turned
and
looked
into
the
chamber
he
could
see
her
nowhere
the
room
was
full
of
doors
and
she
must
have
mistaken
the
door
he
heard
her
voice
calling
him
and
hurried
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
but
he
could
see
nothing
of
her
more
tricks
he
said
to
himself
it
is
of
no
use
to
stab
this
one
i
must
wait
till
i
see
what
can
be
done
still
he
heard
alice
calling
him
and
still
he
followed
as
well
as
he
could
at
length
he
came
to
a
doorway
open
to
the
air
through
which
the
moonlight
fell
but
when
he
reached
it
he
found
that
it
was
high
up
in
the
side
of
a
tower
the
wall
of
which
went
straight
down
from
his
feet
without
stair
or
descent
of
any
kind
again
he
heard
alice
call
him
and
lifting
his
eyes
saw
her
across
a
wide
standing
at
another
door
just
like
the
one
he
was
at
with
the
moon
shining
full
upon
her
all
right
alice
he
cried
can
you
hear
me
yes
answered
she
then
listen
this
is
all
a
trick
it
is
all
a
lie
of
that
old
wretch
in
the
kitchen
just
reach
out
your
hand
alice
dear
alice
did
as
richard
asked
her
and
although
they
saw
each
other
many
yards
off
across
the
court
their
hands
met
there
i
thought
so
exclaimed
richard
triumphantly
now
alice
i
do
believe
it
is
more
than
a
foot
or
two
down
to
the
court
below
though
it
looks
like
a
hundred
feet
keep
fast
hold
of
my
hand
and
jump
when
i
count
three
but
alice
drew
her
hand
from
him
in
sudden
dismay
whereupon
richard
said
well
i
will
try
first
and
jumped
the
same
moment
his
cheery
laugh
came
to
alice
ears
and
she
saw
him
standing
safe
on
the
ground
far
below
jump
dear
alice
and
i
will
catch
you
said
he
i
ca
i
am
afraid
answered
she
the
old
man
is
somewhere
near
you
you
had
better
jump
said
richard
alice
sprang
from
the
wall
in
terror
and
only
fell
a
foot
or
two
into
richard
arms
the
moment
she
touched
the
ground
they
found
themselves
outside
the
door
of
a
little
cottage
which
they
knew
very
well
for
it
was
only
just
within
the
wood
that
bordered
on
their
village
hand
in
hand
they
ran
home
as
fast
as
they
could
when
they
reached
a
little
gate
that
led
into
her
father
grounds
richard
bade
alice
the
tears
came
in
her
eyes
richard
and
she
seemed
to
have
grown
quite
man
and
woman
in
fairyland
and
they
did
not
want
to
part
now
but
they
felt
that
they
must
so
alice
ran
in
the
back
way
and
reached
her
own
room
before
anyone
had
missed
her
indeed
the
last
of
the
red
had
not
quite
faded
from
the
west
as
richard
crossed
the
on
his
way
home
he
saw
an
just
selling
the
last
of
his
umbrellas
he
thought
the
man
gave
him
a
queer
look
as
he
passed
and
felt
very
much
inclined
to
punch
his
head
but
remembering
how
useless
it
had
been
to
punch
the
goblin
head
he
thought
it
better
not
in
reward
of
their
courage
the
fairy
queen
sent
them
permission
to
visit
fairyland
as
often
as
they
pleased
and
no
goblin
or
fairy
was
allowed
to
interfere
with
them
for
peaseblossom
and
toadstool
they
were
both
banished
from
court
and
compelled
to
live
together
for
seven
years
in
an
old
tree
that
had
just
one
green
leaf
upon
it
toadstool
did
not
mind
it
much
but
peaseblossom
did
the
shadows
old
ralph
rinkelmann
made
his
living
by
comic
sketches
and
all
but
lost
it
again
by
tragic
poems
so
he
was
just
the
man
to
be
chosen
king
of
the
fairies
for
in
fairyland
the
sovereignty
is
elective
it
is
no
doubt
very
strange
that
fairies
should
desire
to
have
a
mortal
king
but
the
fact
is
that
with
all
their
knowledge
and
power
they
can
not
get
rid
of
the
feeling
that
some
men
are
greater
than
they
are
though
they
can
neither
fly
nor
play
tricks
so
at
such
times
as
there
happens
to
be
twice
the
usual
number
of
sensible
electors
such
a
man
as
ralph
rinkelmann
gets
to
be
chosen
they
did
not
mean
to
insist
on
his
residence
for
they
needed
his
presence
only
on
special
occasions
but
they
must
get
hold
of
him
somehow
first
of
all
in
order
to
make
him
king
once
he
was
crowned
they
could
get
him
as
often
as
they
pleased
but
before
this
ceremony
there
was
a
difficulty
for
it
is
only
between
life
and
death
that
the
fairies
have
power
over
mortals
and
can
carry
them
off
to
their
country
so
they
had
to
watch
for
an
opportunity
nor
had
they
to
wait
long
for
old
ralph
was
taken
dreadfully
ill
and
while
hovering
between
life
and
death
they
carried
him
off
and
crowned
him
king
of
fairyland
but
after
he
was
crowned
it
was
no
wonder
considering
the
state
of
his
health
that
he
should
not
be
able
to
sit
quite
upright
on
the
throne
of
fairyland
or
that
in
consequence
all
the
gnomes
and
goblins
and
ugly
cruel
things
that
live
in
the
holes
and
corners
of
the
kingdom
should
take
advantage
of
his
condition
and
run
quite
wild
playing
him
king
as
he
was
all
sorts
of
tricks
crowding
about
his
throne
climbing
up
the
steps
and
actually
scrambling
and
quarrelling
like
mice
about
his
ears
and
eyes
so
that
he
could
see
and
think
of
nothing
else
but
i
am
not
going
to
tell
anything
more
about
this
part
of
his
adventures
just
at
present
by
strong
and
sustained
efforts
he
succeeded
after
much
trouble
and
suffering
in
reducing
his
rebellious
subjects
to
order
they
all
vanished
to
their
respective
holes
and
corners
and
king
ralph
coming
to
himself
found
himself
in
his
bed
half
propped
up
with
pillows
but
the
room
was
full
of
dark
creatures
which
gambolled
about
in
the
firelight
in
such
a
strange
huge
though
noiseless
fashion
that
he
thought
at
first
that
some
of
his
rebellious
goblins
had
not
been
subdued
with
the
rest
but
had
followed
him
beyond
the
bounds
of
fairyland
into
his
own
private
house
in
london
how
else
could
these
mad
grotesque
make
their
ugly
appearance
in
ralph
rinkelmann
but
he
soon
found
out
that
although
they
were
like
the
underground
goblins
they
were
very
different
as
well
and
would
require
quite
different
treatment
he
felt
convinced
that
they
were
his
subjects
too
but
that
he
must
have
overlooked
them
somehow
at
his
late
coronation
if
indeed
they
had
been
present
for
he
could
not
recollect
that
he
had
seen
anything
just
like
them
before
he
resolved
therefore
to
pay
particular
attention
to
their
habits
ways
and
characters
else
he
saw
plainly
that
they
would
soon
be
too
much
for
him
as
indeed
this
intrusion
into
his
chamber
where
rinkelmann
who
must
be
queen
if
he
was
king
sat
taking
some
tea
by
the
fireside
evidently
foreshadowed
but
she
perceiving
that
he
was
looking
about
him
with
a
more
composed
expression
than
his
face
had
worn
for
many
days
started
up
and
came
quickly
and
quietly
to
his
side
and
her
face
was
bright
with
gladness
whereupon
the
fire
burned
up
more
cheerily
and
the
figures
became
more
composed
and
respectful
in
their
behaviour
retreating
towards
the
wall
like
attendants
then
the
king
of
fairyland
had
some
tea
and
dry
toast
and
leaning
back
on
his
pillows
nearly
fell
asleep
but
not
quite
for
he
still
watched
the
intruders
presently
the
queen
left
the
room
to
give
some
of
the
young
princes
and
princesses
their
tea
and
the
fire
burned
lower
and
behold
the
figures
grew
as
black
and
as
mad
in
their
gambols
as
ever
their
favourite
games
seemed
to
be
and
and
and
and
many
other
such
and
all
in
the
king
too
so
that
it
was
quite
alarming
it
was
almost
as
bad
as
if
the
house
had
been
haunted
by
certain
creatures
which
shall
be
nameless
in
a
fairy
story
because
with
them
fairyland
will
not
willingly
have
much
to
do
but
it
is
a
mercy
that
they
have
their
slippers
on
said
the
king
to
himself
for
his
head
ached
as
he
lay
back
with
his
eyes
half
shut
and
half
open
too
tired
to
pay
longer
attention
to
their
games
but
on
the
whole
considerably
more
amused
than
offended
with
the
liberties
they
took
for
they
seemed
creatures
and
more
frolicsome
than
positively
he
became
suddenly
aware
that
two
of
them
had
stepped
forward
from
the
walls
upon
which
after
the
manner
of
great
spiders
most
of
them
preferred
sprawling
and
now
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
at
the
foot
of
his
majesty
bed
becking
and
bowing
and
ducking
in
the
most
grotesquely
obsequious
manner
while
every
now
and
then
they
turned
solemnly
round
upon
one
heel
evidently
considering
that
motion
the
highest
token
of
homage
they
could
show
what
do
you
want
said
the
king
that
it
may
please
your
majesty
to
be
better
acquainted
with
us
answered
they
we
are
your
majesty
subjects
i
know
you
are
i
shall
be
most
happy
answered
the
king
we
are
not
what
your
majesty
takes
us
for
though
we
are
not
so
foolish
as
your
majesty
thinks
us
it
is
impossible
to
take
you
for
anything
that
i
know
of
rejoined
the
king
who
wished
to
make
them
talk
and
said
whatever
came
uppermost
for
soldiers
sailors
or
anything
you
will
not
stand
still
long
enough
i
suppose
you
really
belong
to
the
fire
brigade
at
least
you
keep
putting
its
light
out
do
jest
please
your
majesty
and
as
they
said
the
words
for
they
both
spoke
at
once
throughout
the
interview
they
performed
a
grave
somerset
towards
the
king
not
jest
retorted
he
and
with
you
why
you
do
nothing
but
jest
what
are
you
the
shadows
sire
and
when
we
do
jest
sire
we
always
jest
in
earnest
but
perhaps
your
majesty
does
not
see
us
distinctly
i
see
you
perfectly
well
returned
the
king
permit
me
however
rejoined
one
of
the
shadows
and
as
he
spoke
he
approached
the
king
and
lifting
a
dark
forefinger
he
drew
it
lightly
but
carefully
across
the
ridge
of
his
forehead
from
temple
to
temple
the
king
felt
the
soft
gliding
touch
go
like
water
into
every
hollow
and
over
the
top
of
every
height
of
that
of
thought
he
had
involuntarily
closed
his
eyes
during
the
operation
and
when
he
unclosed
them
again
as
soon
as
the
finger
was
withdrawn
he
found
that
they
were
opened
in
more
senses
than
one
the
room
appeared
to
have
extended
itself
on
all
sides
till
he
could
not
exactly
see
where
the
walls
were
and
all
about
it
stood
the
shadows
motionless
they
were
tall
and
solemn
rather
awful
indeed
in
their
appearance
notwithstanding
many
remarkable
traits
of
grotesqueness
for
they
looked
just
like
the
pictures
of
puritans
drawn
by
cavaliers
with
long
arms
and
very
long
thin
legs
from
which
hung
large
loose
feet
while
in
their
countenances
length
of
chin
and
nose
predominated
the
solemnity
of
their
mien
however
overcame
all
the
oddity
of
their
form
so
that
they
were
very
indeed
to
look
at
dressed
as
they
all
were
in
funereal
black
but
a
single
glance
was
all
that
the
king
was
allowed
to
have
for
the
former
operator
waved
his
dusky
palm
across
his
vision
and
once
more
the
king
saw
only
the
walls
and
dark
shapes
flickering
about
upon
them
the
two
who
had
spoken
for
the
rest
seemed
likewise
to
have
vanished
but
at
last
the
king
discovered
them
standing
one
on
each
side
of
the
fireplace
they
kept
close
to
the
and
talked
to
each
other
across
the
length
of
the
thus
avoiding
the
direct
rays
of
the
fire
which
though
light
is
necessary
to
their
appearing
to
human
eyes
do
not
agree
with
them
at
all
much
less
give
birth
to
them
as
the
king
was
soon
to
learn
after
a
few
minutes
they
again
approached
the
bed
and
spoke
thus
it
is
now
getting
dark
please
your
majesty
we
mean
out
of
doors
in
the
snow
your
majesty
may
see
from
where
he
is
lying
the
cold
light
of
its
great
a
famous
carpet
for
the
shadows
to
dance
upon
your
majesty
all
our
brothers
and
sisters
will
be
at
church
now
before
going
to
their
night
work
do
they
always
go
to
church
before
they
go
to
work
they
always
go
to
church
first
where
is
the
church
in
iceland
would
your
majesty
like
to
see
it
how
can
i
go
and
see
it
when
as
you
know
very
well
i
am
ill
in
bed
besides
i
should
be
sure
to
take
cold
in
a
frosty
night
like
this
even
if
i
put
on
the
blankets
and
took
the
for
a
muff
a
sort
of
quivering
passed
over
their
faces
which
seemed
to
be
their
mode
of
laughing
the
whole
shape
of
the
face
shook
and
fluctuated
as
if
it
had
been
some
dark
fluid
till
by
slow
degrees
of
gathering
calm
it
settled
into
its
former
rest
then
one
of
them
drew
aside
the
curtains
of
the
bed
and
the
not
having
been
yet
drawn
the
king
beheld
the
white
glimmering
night
outside
struggling
with
the
heaps
of
darkness
that
tried
to
quench
it
and
the
heavens
full
of
stars
flashing
and
sparkling
like
live
jewels
the
other
shadow
went
towards
the
fire
and
vanished
in
it
scores
of
shadows
immediately
began
an
insane
dance
all
about
the
room
disappearing
one
after
the
other
through
the
uncovered
window
and
gliding
darkly
away
over
the
face
of
the
white
snow
for
the
window
looked
at
once
on
a
field
of
snow
in
a
few
moments
the
room
was
quite
cleared
of
them
but
instead
of
being
relieved
by
their
absence
the
king
felt
immediately
as
if
he
were
in
a
and
could
hardly
breathe
for
the
sense
of
emptiness
and
desolation
that
fell
upon
him
but
as
he
lay
looking
out
on
the
snow
which
stretched
blank
and
wide
before
him
he
spied
in
the
distance
a
long
dark
line
which
drew
nearer
and
nearer
and
showed
itself
at
last
to
be
all
the
shadows
walking
in
a
double
row
and
carrying
in
the
midst
of
them
something
like
a
bier
they
vanished
under
the
window
but
soon
reappeared
having
somehow
climbed
up
the
wall
of
the
house
for
they
entered
in
perfect
order
by
the
window
as
if
melting
through
the
transparency
of
the
glass
they
still
carried
the
bier
or
litter
it
was
covered
with
richest
furs
and
skins
of
gorgeous
wild
beasts
whose
eyes
were
replaced
by
sapphires
and
emeralds
that
glittered
and
gleamed
in
the
fire
and
snow
light
the
outermost
skin
sparkled
with
frost
but
the
inside
ones
were
soft
and
warm
and
dry
as
the
down
under
a
swan
wing
the
shadows
approached
the
bed
and
set
the
litter
upon
it
then
a
number
of
them
brought
a
huge
fur
robe
and
wrapping
it
round
the
king
laid
him
on
the
litter
in
the
midst
of
the
furs
nothing
could
be
more
gentle
and
respectful
than
the
way
in
which
they
moved
him
and
he
never
thought
of
refusing
to
go
then
they
put
something
on
his
head
and
lifting
the
litter
carried
him
once
round
the
room
to
fall
into
order
as
he
passed
the
mirror
he
saw
that
he
was
covered
with
royal
ermine
and
that
his
head
wore
a
wonderful
crown
of
gold
set
with
none
but
red
stones
rubies
and
carbuncles
and
garnets
and
others
whose
names
he
could
not
tell
glowed
gloriously
around
his
head
like
the
salamandrine
essence
of
all
the
christmas
fires
over
the
world
a
sceptre
lay
beside
him
a
rod
of
ebony
surmounted
by
a
diamond
which
cut
in
a
hundred
facets
flashed
all
the
hues
of
the
rainbow
and
threw
coloured
gleams
on
every
side
that
looked
like
shadows
too
but
more
ethereal
than
those
that
bore
him
then
the
shadows
rose
gently
to
the
window
passed
through
it
and
sinking
slowing
upon
the
field
of
outstretched
snow
commenced
an
orderly
gliding
rather
than
march
along
the
frozen
surface
they
took
it
by
turns
to
bear
the
king
as
they
sped
with
the
swiftness
of
thought
in
a
straight
line
towards
the
north
the
rose
above
their
heads
with
visible
rapidity
for
indeed
they
moved
quite
as
fast
as
sad
thoughts
though
not
with
all
the
speed
of
happy
desires
england
and
scotland
slid
past
the
litter
of
the
king
of
the
shadows
over
rivers
and
lakes
they
skimmed
and
glided
they
climbed
the
high
mountains
and
crossed
the
valleys
with
a
fearless
bound
till
they
came
to
house
and
the
northern
sea
the
sea
was
not
frozen
for
all
the
stars
shone
as
clear
out
of
the
deeps
below
as
they
shone
out
of
the
deeps
above
and
as
the
bearers
slid
along
the
surface
with
never
a
furrow
in
their
track
so
pure
was
the
water
beneath
that
the
king
saw
neither
surface
bottom
nor
substance
to
it
and
seemed
to
be
gliding
only
through
the
blue
sphere
of
heaven
with
the
stars
above
him
and
the
stars
below
him
and
between
the
stars
and
him
nothing
but
an
emptiness
where
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
his
soul
felt
that
it
had
room
enough
at
length
they
reached
the
rocky
shores
of
iceland
there
they
landed
still
pursuing
their
journey
all
this
time
the
king
felt
no
cold
for
the
red
stones
in
his
crown
kept
him
warm
and
the
emerald
and
sapphire
eyes
of
the
wild
beasts
kept
the
frosts
from
settling
upon
his
litter
oftentimes
upon
their
way
they
had
to
pass
through
forests
caverns
and
paths
where
it
was
so
dark
that
at
first
the
king
feared
he
should
lose
his
shadows
altogether
but
as
soon
as
they
entered
such
places
the
diamond
in
his
sceptre
began
to
shine
and
glow
and
flash
sending
out
streams
of
light
of
all
the
colours
that
painter
soul
could
dream
of
in
which
light
the
shadows
grew
livelier
and
stronger
than
ever
speeding
through
the
dark
ways
with
an
all
but
blinding
swiftness
in
the
light
of
the
diamond
too
some
of
their
forms
became
more
simple
and
human
while
others
seemed
only
to
break
out
into
a
yet
more
untamable
absurdity
once
as
they
passed
through
a
cave
the
king
actually
saw
some
of
their
eyes
strange
he
had
never
seen
any
of
their
eyes
before
but
at
the
same
moment
when
he
saw
their
eyes
he
knew
their
faces
too
for
they
turned
them
full
upon
him
for
an
instant
and
the
other
shadows
catching
sight
of
these
shrank
and
shivered
and
nearly
vanished
lovely
faces
they
were
but
the
king
was
very
thoughtful
after
he
saw
them
and
continued
rather
troubled
all
the
rest
of
the
journey
he
could
not
account
for
those
faces
being
there
and
the
faces
of
shadows
too
with
living
eyes
but
he
soon
found
that
amongst
the
shgadows
a
man
must
learn
never
to
be
surprised
at
anything
for
if
he
does
not
he
will
soon
grow
quite
stupid
in
consequence
of
the
endless
recurrence
of
surprises
at
last
they
climbed
up
the
bed
of
a
little
stream
and
then
passing
through
a
narrow
rocky
defile
came
out
suddenly
upon
the
side
of
a
mountain
overlooking
a
blue
frozen
lake
in
the
very
heart
of
mighty
hills
overhead
the
was
shivering
and
flashing
like
a
battle
of
ten
thousand
spears
underneath
its
beams
passed
faintly
over
the
blue
ice
and
the
sides
of
the
mountains
whose
tops
shot
up
like
huge
icicles
all
about
with
here
and
there
a
star
sparkling
on
the
very
tip
of
one
but
as
the
northern
lights
in
the
sky
above
so
wavered
and
quivered
and
shot
hither
and
thither
the
shadows
on
the
surface
of
the
lake
below
now
gathering
in
groups
and
now
shivering
asunder
now
covering
the
whole
surface
of
the
lake
and
anon
condensed
into
one
dark
knot
in
the
centre
every
here
and
there
on
the
white
mountains
might
be
seen
two
or
three
shooting
away
towards
the
tops
to
vanish
beyond
them
so
that
their
number
was
gradually
though
not
visibly
diminishing
please
your
majesty
said
the
shadows
this
is
our
church
the
church
of
the
shadows
and
so
saying
the
king
set
down
the
litter
upon
a
rock
and
plunged
into
the
multitudes
below
they
soon
returned
however
and
bore
the
king
down
into
the
middle
of
the
lake
all
the
shadows
came
crowding
round
him
respectfully
but
fearlessly
and
sure
never
such
a
grotesque
assembly
revealed
itself
before
to
mortal
eyes
the
king
had
seen
all
kind
of
gnomes
goblins
and
kobolds
at
his
coronation
but
they
were
quite
rectilinear
figures
compared
with
the
insane
lawlessness
of
form
in
which
the
shadows
rejoiced
and
the
wildest
gambols
of
the
former
were
orderly
dances
of
ceremony
beside
the
apparently
aimless
and
wilful
contortions
of
figure
and
metamorphoses
of
shape
in
which
the
latter
indulged
they
retained
however
all
the
time
to
the
surprise
of
the
king
an
identity
each
of
his
own
type
inexplicably
perceptible
through
every
change
indeed
this
preservation
of
the
primary
idea
of
each
form
was
more
wonderful
than
the
bewildering
and
ridiculous
alterations
to
which
the
form
itself
was
every
moment
subjected
what
are
you
said
the
king
leaning
on
his
elbow
and
looking
around
him
the
shadows
your
majesty
answered
several
voices
at
once
what
shadows
the
human
shadows
the
shadows
of
men
and
women
and
their
children
are
you
not
the
shadows
of
chairs
and
tables
and
pokers
and
tongs
just
as
well
at
this
question
a
strange
jarring
commotion
went
through
the
assembly
with
a
shock
several
of
the
figures
shot
up
as
high
as
the
aurora
but
instantly
settled
down
again
to
human
size
as
if
overmastering
their
feelings
out
of
respect
to
him
who
had
roused
them
one
who
had
bounded
to
the
highest
visible
icy
peak
and
as
suddenly
returned
now
elbowed
his
way
through
the
rest
and
made
himself
spokesman
for
them
during
the
remaining
part
of
the
dialogue
excuse
our
agitation
your
majesty
said
he
i
see
your
majesty
has
not
yet
thought
proper
to
make
himself
acquainted
with
our
nature
and
habits
i
wish
to
do
so
now
replied
the
king
we
are
the
shadows
repeated
the
shadow
solemnly
well
said
the
king
we
do
not
often
appear
to
men
ha
said
the
king
we
do
not
belong
to
the
sunshine
at
all
we
go
through
it
unseen
and
only
by
a
passing
chill
do
men
recognize
an
unknown
presence
ha
said
the
king
again
it
is
only
in
the
twilight
of
the
fire
or
when
one
man
or
woman
is
alone
with
a
single
candle
or
when
any
number
of
people
are
all
feeling
the
same
thing
at
once
making
them
one
that
we
show
ourselves
and
the
truth
of
things
can
that
be
true
that
loves
the
night
said
the
king
the
darkness
is
the
nurse
of
light
answered
the
shadow
can
that
be
true
which
mocks
at
forms
said
the
king
truth
rides
abroad
in
shapeless
storms
answered
the
shadow
ha
ha
thought
ralph
rinkelmann
it
rhymes
the
shadow
caps
my
questions
with
his
answers
very
strange
and
he
grew
thoughtful
again
the
shadow
was
the
first
to
resume
please
your
majesty
may
we
present
our
petition
by
all
means
replied
the
king
i
am
not
well
enough
to
receive
it
in
proper
state
never
mind
your
majesty
we
do
not
care
for
much
ceremony
and
indeed
none
of
us
are
quite
well
at
present
the
subject
of
our
petition
weighs
upon
us
go
on
said
the
king
sire
began
the
shadow
our
very
existence
is
in
danger
the
various
sorts
of
artificial
light
both
in
houses
and
in
men
women
and
children
threaten
to
end
our
being
the
use
and
the
disposition
of
gaslights
especially
high
in
the
centres
blind
the
eyes
by
which
alone
we
can
be
perceived
we
are
all
but
banished
from
towns
we
are
driven
into
villages
and
lonely
houses
chiefly
old
out
of
which
even
our
friends
the
fairies
are
fast
disappearing
we
therefore
petition
our
king
by
the
power
of
his
art
to
restore
us
to
our
rights
in
the
house
itself
and
in
the
hearts
of
its
inhabitants
but
said
the
king
you
frighten
the
children
very
seldom
your
majesty
and
then
only
for
their
good
we
seldom
seek
to
frighten
anybody
we
mostly
want
to
make
people
silent
and
thoughtful
to
awe
them
a
little
your
majesty
you
are
much
more
likely
to
make
them
laugh
said
the
king
are
we
said
the
shadow
and
approaching
the
king
one
step
he
stood
quite
still
for
a
moment
the
diamond
of
the
king
sceptre
shot
out
a
vivid
flame
of
violet
light
and
the
king
stared
at
the
shadow
in
silence
and
his
lip
quivered
he
never
told
what
he
saw
then
but
he
would
say
just
fancy
what
it
might
be
if
flitting
thoughts
were
to
persist
in
staying
to
be
looked
at
it
is
only
resumed
the
shadow
when
our
thoughts
are
not
fixed
upon
any
particular
object
that
our
bodies
are
subject
to
all
the
vagaries
of
elemental
influences
generally
amongst
worldly
men
and
frivolous
women
we
only
attach
ourselves
to
some
article
of
furniture
or
of
dress
and
they
never
doubt
that
we
are
mere
foolish
and
vague
results
of
the
dashing
of
the
waves
of
the
light
against
the
solid
forms
of
which
their
houses
are
full
we
do
not
care
to
tell
them
the
truth
for
they
would
never
see
it
but
let
the
worldly
man
or
the
frivolous
woman
and
then
at
each
of
the
pauses
indicated
the
mass
of
shadows
throbbed
and
heaved
with
emotion
but
they
soon
settled
again
into
comparative
stillness
once
more
the
shadow
addressed
himself
to
speak
but
suddenly
they
all
looked
up
and
the
king
following
their
gaze
saw
that
the
aurora
had
begun
to
pale
the
moon
is
rising
said
the
shadow
as
soon
as
she
looks
over
the
mountains
into
the
valley
we
must
be
gone
for
we
have
plenty
to
do
by
the
moon
we
are
powerful
in
her
light
but
if
your
majesty
will
come
here
night
your
majesty
may
learn
a
great
deal
more
about
us
and
judge
for
himself
whether
it
be
fit
to
accord
our
petition
for
then
will
be
our
grand
annual
assembly
in
which
we
report
to
our
chiefs
the
things
we
have
attempted
and
the
good
or
bad
success
we
have
had
if
you
send
for
me
returned
the
king
i
will
come
ere
the
shadow
could
reply
the
tip
of
the
moon
crescent
horn
peeped
up
from
behind
an
icy
pinnacle
and
one
slender
ray
fell
on
the
lake
it
shone
upon
no
shadows
ere
the
eye
of
the
king
could
again
seek
the
earth
after
beholding
the
first
brightness
of
the
moon
resurrection
they
had
vanished
and
the
surface
of
the
lake
glittered
gold
and
blue
in
the
pale
moonlight
there
the
king
lay
alone
in
the
midst
of
the
frozen
lake
with
the
moon
staring
at
him
but
at
length
he
heard
from
somewhere
a
voice
that
he
knew
will
you
take
another
cup
of
tea
dear
said
rinkelmann
and
ralph
coming
slowly
to
himself
found
that
he
was
lying
in
his
own
bed
yes
i
will
he
answered
and
rather
a
large
piece
of
toast
if
you
please
for
i
have
been
a
long
journey
since
i
saw
you
last
he
has
not
come
to
himself
quite
said
rinkelmann
between
her
and
herself
you
would
be
rather
surprised
continued
ralph
if
i
told
you
where
i
had
been
i
dare
say
i
should
responded
his
wife
then
i
will
tell
you
rejoined
ralph
but
at
that
moment
a
great
shadow
bounced
out
of
the
fire
with
a
single
huge
leap
and
covered
the
whole
room
then
it
settled
in
one
corner
and
ralph
saw
it
shaking
its
fist
at
him
from
the
end
of
a
preposterous
arm
so
he
took
the
hint
and
held
his
peace
and
it
was
as
well
for
him
for
i
happen
to
know
something
about
the
shadows
too
and
i
know
that
if
he
had
told
his
wife
all
about
it
just
then
they
would
not
have
sent
for
him
the
following
evening
but
as
the
king
after
finishing
his
tea
and
toast
lay
and
looked
about
him
the
shadows
dancing
in
his
room
seemed
to
him
odder
and
more
inexplicable
than
ever
the
whole
chamber
was
full
of
mystery
so
it
generally
was
but
now
it
was
more
mysterious
than
ever
after
all
that
he
had
seen
in
the
his
own
room
and
its
shadows
were
yet
more
wonderful
and
unintelligible
than
those
this
made
it
the
more
likely
that
he
had
seen
a
true
vision
for
instead
of
making
common
things
look
commonplace
as
a
false
vision
would
have
done
it
had
made
common
things
disclose
the
wonderful
that
was
in
them
the
same
applies
to
all
arts
as
well
thought
ralph
rinkelmann
the
next
afternoon
as
the
twilight
was
growing
dusky
the
king
lay
wondering
whether
or
not
the
shadows
would
fetch
him
again
he
wanted
very
much
to
go
for
he
had
enjoyed
the
journey
exceedingly
and
he
longed
besides
to
hear
some
of
the
shadows
tell
their
stories
but
the
darkness
grew
deeper
and
deeper
and
the
shadows
did
not
come
the
cause
was
that
rinkelmann
sat
by
the
fire
in
the
gloaming
and
they
could
not
carry
off
the
king
while
she
was
there
some
of
them
tried
to
frighten
her
away
by
playing
the
oddest
pranks
on
the
walls
and
floor
and
ceiling
but
altogether
without
effect
the
queen
only
smiled
for
she
had
a
good
conscience
suddenly
however
a
dreadful
scream
was
heard
from
the
nursery
and
rinkelmann
rushed
upstairs
to
see
what
was
the
matter
no
sooner
had
she
gone
than
the
two
warders
of
the
stepped
out
into
the
middle
of
the
room
and
said
in
a
low
voice
is
your
majesty
ready
have
you
no
hearts
said
the
king
or
are
they
as
black
as
your
faces
did
you
not
hear
the
child
scream
i
must
know
what
is
the
matter
with
her
before
i
go
your
majesty
may
keep
his
mind
easy
on
that
point
replied
the
warders
we
had
tried
everything
we
could
think
of
to
get
rid
of
her
majesty
the
queen
but
without
effect
so
a
young
madcap
shadow
half
against
the
will
of
the
older
ones
of
us
slipped
upstairs
into
the
nursery
and
has
no
doubt
succeeded
in
appalling
the
baby
for
he
is
very
lithe
and
now
your
majesty
i
will
have
no
such
tricks
played
in
my
nursery
said
the
king
rather
angrily
you
might
put
the
child
beside
itself
then
there
would
be
twins
your
majesty
and
we
rather
like
twins
none
of
your
miserable
jesting
you
might
put
the
child
out
of
her
wits
impossible
sire
for
she
has
not
got
into
them
yet
go
away
said
the
king
forgive
us
your
majesty
really
it
will
do
the
child
good
for
that
shadow
will
all
her
life
be
to
her
a
symbol
of
what
is
ugly
and
bad
when
she
feels
in
danger
of
hating
or
envying
anyone
that
shadow
will
come
back
to
her
mind
and
make
her
shudder
very
well
said
the
king
i
like
that
let
us
go
the
shadows
went
through
the
same
ceremonies
and
preparations
as
before
during
which
the
young
shadow
contrived
to
make
such
grimaces
as
kept
the
baby
in
terror
and
the
queen
in
the
nursery
till
all
was
ready
then
with
a
bound
that
doubled
him
up
against
the
ceiling
and
a
kick
of
his
legs
six
feet
out
behind
him
he
vanished
through
the
nursery
door
and
reached
the
king
just
in
time
to
take
his
place
with
the
last
who
were
melting
through
the
window
in
the
rear
of
the
litter
and
settling
down
upon
the
snow
beneath
away
they
went
as
before
a
gliding
blackness
over
the
white
carpet
and
it
was
when
they
came
in
sight
of
the
the
king
saw
that
it
was
crowded
over
its
whole
surface
with
a
changeful
intermingling
of
shadows
they
were
all
talking
and
listening
alternately
in
pairs
trios
and
groups
of
every
size
here
and
there
large
companies
were
absorbed
in
attention
to
one
elevated
above
the
rest
not
in
a
pulpit
or
on
a
platform
but
on
the
stilts
of
his
own
legs
elongated
for
the
nonce
the
aurora
right
overhead
lighted
up
the
lake
and
the
sides
of
the
mountains
by
sending
down
from
the
zenith
nearly
to
the
surface
of
the
lake
great
folded
vapours
luminous
with
all
the
colours
of
a
faint
rainbow
many
however
as
the
words
were
that
passed
on
all
sides
not
a
shadow
of
a
sound
reached
the
ears
of
the
king
the
could
not
enter
his
corporeal
organs
one
of
his
guides
however
seeing
that
the
king
wanted
to
hear
and
could
not
went
through
a
strange
manipulation
of
his
head
and
ears
after
which
he
could
hear
perfectly
though
still
only
the
voice
to
which
for
the
time
he
directed
his
attention
this
however
was
a
great
advantage
and
one
which
the
king
longed
to
carry
back
with
him
to
the
world
of
men
the
king
now
discovered
that
this
was
not
merely
the
church
of
the
shadows
but
their
news
exchange
at
the
same
time
for
as
the
shadows
have
no
writing
or
printing
the
only
way
in
which
they
can
make
each
other
acquainted
with
their
doings
and
thinkings
is
to
meet
and
talk
at
this
and
parliament
of
shades
and
as
in
the
world
people
read
their
favourite
authors
and
listen
to
their
favourite
speakers
so
here
the
shadows
seek
their
favourite
shadows
listen
to
their
adventures
and
hear
generally
what
they
have
to
say
feeling
quite
strong
the
king
rose
and
walked
about
amongst
them
wrapped
in
his
ermine
robe
with
his
red
crown
on
his
head
and
his
diamond
sceptre
in
his
hand
every
group
of
shadows
to
which
he
drew
near
ceased
talking
as
soon
as
they
saw
him
approach
but
at
a
nod
they
went
on
again
directly
conversing
and
relating
and
commenting
as
if
no
one
was
there
of
other
kind
or
of
higher
rank
than
themselves
so
the
king
heard
a
good
many
stories
at
some
of
them
he
laughed
and
at
some
of
them
he
cried
but
if
the
stories
that
the
shadows
told
were
printed
they
would
make
a
book
that
no
publisher
could
produce
fast
enough
to
satisfy
the
buyers
i
will
record
some
of
the
things
that
the
king
heard
for
he
told
them
to
me
soon
after
in
fact
i
was
for
some
time
his
private
secretary
i
made
him
confess
before
a
week
was
over
said
a
gloomy
old
shadow
but
what
was
the
good
of
that
rejoined
a
pert
young
one
that
could
not
undo
what
was
done
yes
it
could
what
bring
the
dead
to
life
no
but
comfort
the
murderer
i
could
not
bear
to
see
the
pitiable
misery
he
was
in
he
was
far
happier
with
the
rope
round
his
neck
than
he
was
with
the
purse
in
his
pocket
i
saved
him
from
killing
himself
too
how
did
you
make
him
confess
only
by
wallowing
on
the
wall
a
little
how
could
that
make
him
tell
knows
the
shadow
was
silent
and
the
king
turned
to
another
who
was
preparing
to
speak
i
made
a
fashionable
mother
repent
how
broke
from
several
voices
in
whose
sound
was
mingled
a
touch
of
incredulity
only
by
making
a
little
coffin
on
the
wall
was
the
reply
did
the
fashionable
mother
confess
too
she
had
nothing
more
to
confess
than
everybody
knew
what
did
everybody
know
then
that
she
might
have
been
kissing
a
living
child
when
she
followed
a
dead
one
to
the
the
next
will
fare
better
i
put
a
stop
to
a
wedding
said
another
horrid
shade
remarked
a
poetic
imp
how
said
others
tell
us
how
only
by
throwing
a
darkness
as
if
from
the
branch
of
a
sconce
over
the
forehead
of
a
fair
they
are
not
married
yet
and
i
do
not
think
they
will
be
but
i
loved
the
youth
who
loved
her
how
he
started
it
was
a
revelation
to
him
but
did
it
not
deceive
him
quite
the
contrary
but
it
was
only
a
shadow
from
the
outside
not
a
shadow
coming
through
from
the
soul
of
the
girl
yes
you
may
say
so
but
it
was
all
that
was
wanted
to
make
the
meaning
of
her
forehead
manifest
yes
of
her
whole
face
which
had
now
and
then
in
the
pauses
of
his
passion
perplexed
the
youth
all
of
it
curled
nostrils
pouting
lips
projecting
chin
instantly
fell
into
harmony
with
that
darkness
between
her
eyebrows
the
youth
understood
it
in
a
moment
and
went
home
miserable
and
they
not
married
i
caught
a
toper
alone
over
his
magnum
of
port
said
a
very
dark
shadow
and
did
i
give
it
him
i
made
first
and
then
i
settled
into
a
funeral
passing
slowly
along
the
length
of
the
opposite
wall
i
gave
him
plenty
of
plumes
and
mourning
coaches
and
then
i
gave
him
a
funeral
service
but
i
could
not
manage
to
make
the
surplice
white
which
was
all
the
better
for
such
a
sinner
the
wretch
stared
till
his
face
passed
from
purple
to
grey
and
actually
left
his
fifth
glass
only
unfinished
and
took
refuge
with
his
wife
and
children
in
the
much
to
their
surprise
i
believe
he
actually
drank
a
cup
of
tea
and
although
i
have
often
looked
in
since
i
have
never
caught
him
again
drinking
alone
at
least
but
does
he
drink
less
have
you
done
him
any
good
i
hope
so
but
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
ca
feel
sure
about
it
humph
humph
humph
grunted
various
shadow
throats
i
had
such
fun
once
cried
another
i
made
such
game
of
a
young
clergyman
you
have
no
right
to
make
game
of
anyone
oh
yes
i
have
when
it
is
for
his
good
he
used
to
study
his
sermons
where
do
you
think
in
his
study
of
course
where
else
should
it
be
yes
and
no
guess
again
out
amongst
the
faces
in
the
streets
guess
again
in
still
green
places
in
the
country
guess
again
in
old
books
guess
again
no
no
tell
us
in
the
looking
glass
ha
ha
ha
he
was
fair
game
fair
shadow
game
i
thought
so
and
i
made
such
fun
of
him
one
night
on
the
wall
he
had
sense
enough
to
see
that
it
was
himself
and
very
like
an
ape
so
he
got
ashamed
turned
the
mirror
with
its
face
to
the
wall
and
thought
a
little
more
about
his
people
and
a
little
less
about
himself
i
was
very
glad
for
please
your
majesty
and
here
the
speaker
turned
towards
the
king
we
do
like
the
creatures
that
live
in
the
mirrors
you
call
them
ghosts
do
you
before
the
king
could
reply
another
had
commenced
but
the
story
about
the
clergyman
had
made
the
king
wish
to
hear
one
of
the
so
he
turned
him
towards
a
long
shadow
who
was
preaching
to
a
very
quiet
and
listening
crowd
he
was
just
concluding
his
sermon
therefore
dear
shadows
it
is
the
more
needful
that
we
love
one
another
as
much
as
we
can
because
that
is
not
much
we
have
no
such
excuse
for
not
loving
as
mortals
have
for
we
do
not
die
like
them
i
suppose
it
is
the
thought
of
that
death
that
makes
them
hate
so
much
then
again
we
go
to
sleep
all
day
most
of
us
and
not
in
the
night
as
men
do
and
you
know
that
we
forget
everything
that
happened
the
night
before
therefore
we
ought
to
love
well
for
the
love
is
short
ah
dear
shadow
whom
i
love
now
with
all
my
shadowy
soul
i
shall
not
love
thee
eve
i
shall
not
know
thee
i
shall
pass
thee
in
the
crowd
and
never
dream
that
the
shadow
whom
i
now
love
is
near
me
then
happy
shades
for
we
only
remember
our
tales
until
we
have
told
them
here
and
then
they
vanish
in
the
where
we
bury
only
our
dead
selves
ah
brethren
who
would
be
a
man
and
remember
who
would
be
a
man
and
weep
we
ought
indeed
to
love
one
another
for
we
alone
inherit
oblivion
we
alone
are
renewed
with
eternal
birth
we
alone
have
no
gathered
weight
of
years
i
will
tell
you
the
awful
fate
of
one
shadow
who
rebelled
against
his
nature
and
sought
to
remember
the
past
he
said
remember
this
eve
he
fought
with
the
genial
influences
of
kindly
sleep
when
the
sun
rose
on
the
awful
dead
day
of
light
and
although
he
could
not
keep
quite
awake
he
dreamed
of
the
foregone
eve
and
he
never
forgot
his
dream
then
he
tried
again
the
next
night
and
the
next
and
the
next
and
he
tempted
another
shadow
to
try
it
with
him
but
at
last
their
awful
fate
overtook
them
for
instead
of
continuing
to
be
shadows
they
began
to
cast
shadows
as
foolish
men
say
and
so
they
thickened
and
thickened
till
they
vanished
out
of
our
world
they
are
now
condemned
to
walk
the
earth
a
man
and
a
woman
with
death
behind
them
and
memories
within
them
ah
brother
shades
let
us
love
one
another
for
we
shall
soon
forget
we
are
not
men
but
shadows
the
king
turned
away
and
pitied
the
poor
shadows
far
more
than
they
pitied
men
oh
how
we
played
with
a
musician
one
night
exclaimed
a
shadow
in
another
group
to
which
the
king
had
first
directed
a
passing
thought
and
then
had
stopped
to
up
and
down
we
went
like
the
hammers
and
dampers
on
his
piano
but
he
took
his
revenge
on
us
for
after
he
had
watched
us
for
half
an
hour
in
the
twilight
he
rose
and
went
to
his
instrument
and
played
a
that
fixed
us
all
in
sound
for
ever
each
could
tell
the
very
notes
meant
for
him
and
as
long
as
he
played
we
could
not
stop
but
went
on
dancing
and
dancing
after
the
music
just
as
the
magician
i
mean
the
musician
pleased
and
he
punished
us
well
for
he
nearly
danced
us
all
off
our
legs
and
out
of
shape
into
tired
heaps
of
collapsed
and
palpitating
darkness
we
go
near
him
for
some
time
again
if
we
can
only
remember
it
he
had
been
very
miserable
all
day
he
was
so
poor
and
we
could
not
think
of
any
way
of
comforting
him
except
making
him
laugh
we
did
not
succeed
with
our
wildest
efforts
but
it
turned
out
better
than
we
had
expected
after
all
for
his
got
him
into
notice
and
he
is
quite
popular
now
and
making
money
if
he
does
not
take
care
we
shall
have
other
work
to
do
with
him
by
and
by
poor
fellow
i
and
some
others
did
the
same
for
a
poor
once
he
had
a
christmas
piece
to
write
and
not
being
an
original
genius
it
was
not
so
easy
for
him
to
find
a
subject
as
it
is
for
most
of
his
class
i
saw
the
trouble
he
was
in
and
collecting
a
few
stray
shadows
we
acted
in
of
course
the
funniest
bit
of
nonsense
we
could
think
of
and
it
was
quite
successful
the
poor
fellow
watched
every
motion
roaring
with
laughter
at
us
and
delight
at
the
ideas
we
put
into
his
head
he
turned
it
all
into
words
and
scenes
and
actions
and
the
piece
came
off
with
a
splendid
success
but
how
long
we
have
to
look
for
a
chance
of
doing
anything
worth
doing
said
a
long
thin
especially
lugubrious
shadow
i
have
only
done
one
thing
worth
telling
ever
since
we
met
last
but
i
am
proud
of
that
what
was
it
what
was
it
rose
from
twenty
voices
i
crept
into
a
one
twilight
soon
after
i
had
been
drawn
thither
by
the
glow
of
a
bright
fire
shining
through
red
at
first
i
thought
there
was
no
one
there
and
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
room
and
going
out
again
into
the
snowy
street
when
i
suddenly
caught
the
sparkle
of
eyes
i
found
that
they
belonged
to
a
little
boy
who
lay
very
still
on
a
sofa
i
crept
into
a
dark
corner
by
the
sideboard
and
watched
him
he
seemed
very
sad
and
did
nothing
but
stare
into
the
fire
at
last
he
sighed
out
wish
mamma
would
come
home
boy
thought
i
is
no
help
for
that
but
mamma
yet
i
would
try
to
while
away
the
time
for
him
so
out
of
my
corner
i
stretched
a
long
shadow
arm
reaching
all
across
the
ceiling
and
pretended
to
make
a
grab
at
him
he
was
rather
frightened
at
first
but
he
was
a
brave
boy
and
soon
saw
that
it
was
all
a
joke
so
when
i
did
it
again
he
made
a
clutch
at
me
and
then
we
had
such
fun
for
though
he
often
sighed
and
wished
mamma
would
come
home
he
always
began
again
with
me
and
on
we
went
with
the
wildest
games
at
last
his
mother
knock
came
to
the
door
and
starting
up
in
delight
he
rushed
into
the
hall
to
meet
her
and
forgot
all
about
poor
black
me
but
i
did
not
mind
that
in
the
least
for
when
i
glided
out
after
him
into
the
hall
i
was
well
repaid
for
my
trouble
by
hearing
his
mother
say
to
him
charlie
my
dear
you
look
ever
so
much
better
since
i
left
you
at
that
moment
i
slipped
through
the
closing
door
and
as
i
ran
across
the
snow
i
heard
the
mother
say
shadow
can
that
be
passing
so
quickly
and
charlie
answered
with
a
merry
laugh
mamma
i
suppose
it
must
be
the
funny
shadow
that
has
been
playing
such
games
with
me
all
the
time
you
were
out
as
soon
as
the
door
was
shut
i
crept
along
the
wall
and
looked
in
at
the
window
and
i
heard
his
mamma
say
as
she
led
him
into
the
room
an
imagination
the
boy
has
ha
ha
ha
then
she
looked
at
him
and
the
tears
came
in
her
eyes
and
she
stooped
down
over
him
and
i
heard
the
sounds
of
a
mingling
kiss
and
sob
i
always
look
for
nurseries
full
of
children
said
another
and
this
winter
i
have
been
very
fortunate
i
am
sure
children
belong
especially
to
us
one
evening
looking
about
in
a
great
city
i
saw
through
the
window
into
a
large
nursery
where
the
odious
gas
had
not
yet
been
lighted
round
the
fire
sat
a
company
of
the
most
delightful
children
i
had
ever
seen
they
were
waiting
patiently
for
their
tea
it
was
too
good
an
opportunity
to
be
lost
i
hurried
away
and
gathering
together
twenty
of
the
best
shadows
i
could
find
returned
in
a
few
moments
and
entering
the
nursery
we
danced
on
the
walls
one
of
our
best
dances
to
be
sure
it
was
mostly
extemporized
but
i
managed
to
keep
it
in
harmony
by
singing
this
song
which
i
made
as
we
went
on
of
course
the
children
could
not
hear
it
they
only
saw
the
motions
that
answered
to
it
but
with
them
they
seemed
to
be
very
much
delighted
indeed
as
i
shall
presently
prove
to
you
this
was
the
song
swang
swingle
swuff
flicker
flacker
fling
fluff
thus
we
go
to
and
fro
here
and
there
everywhere
born
and
bred
never
dead
only
gone
come
on
looming
glooming
spreading
fuming
shattering
scattering
parting
darting
settling
starting
all
our
life
is
a
strife
and
a
wearying
for
rest
on
the
darkness
friendly
breast
splitting
rising
sitting
laughing
shaking
sides
all
aching
grumbling
grim
and
gruff
swingle

a

a

the

black
and
black
enough
now
like
demons
lying
like
the
dead
gladly
would
we
stop
it
and
go
down
to
bed
but
our
work
we
still
must
do
shadow

as
well
as
you

the

are
said
one
of
the
children
a
thoughtful
little
girl
wonder
where
they
come
from
said
a
dreamy
little
boy
think
they
grow
out
of
the
wall
answered
the
little
girl
i
have
been
watching
them
come
first
one
and
then
another
and
then
a
whole
lot
of
them
i
am
sure
they
grow
out
of
the
walls
they
have
papas
and
mammas
said
an
older
boy
with
a
smile
yes
and
the
doctor
brings
them
in
his
pocket
said
another
a
consequential
little
maiden
i
tell
you
said
the
older
boy
ghosts
ghosts
are
white
but
these
have
got
black
coming
down
the
chimney
said
a
boy
of
fourteen
who
had
been
reading
by
the
firelight
and
had
stopped
to
hear
the
little
ones
talk
body
ghosts
they
not
soul
ghosts
silence
followed
broken
by
the
first
the
boy
who
said
hope
they
did
make
me
at
which
they
all
burst
out
laughing
just
then
the
nurse
brought
in
their
tea
and
when
she
proceeded
to
light
the
gas
we
vanished
i
stopped
a
murder
cried
another
how
how
how
i
will
tell
you
i
had
been
lurking
about
a
for
some
time
where
a
miser
lay
apparently
dying
i
did
not
like
the
place
at
all
but
i
felt
as
if
i
should
be
wanted
there
there
were
plenty
of
about
for
the
room
was
full
of
all
sorts
of
old
furniture
especially
cabinets
chests
and
presses
i
believe
he
had
in
that
room
every
bit
of
the
property
he
had
spent
a
long
life
in
gathering
i
found
that
he
had
gold
and
gold
in
those
places
for
one
night
when
his
nurse
was
away
he
crept
out
of
bed
mumbling
and
shaking
and
managed
to
open
one
of
his
chests
though
he
nearly
fell
down
with
the
effort
i
was
peeping
over
his
shoulder
and
such
a
gleam
of
gold
fell
upon
me
that
it
nearly
killed
me
but
hearing
his
nurse
coming
he
slammed
the
lid
down
and
i
recovered
i
tried
very
hard
but
i
could
not
do
him
any
good
for
although
i
made
all
sorts
of
shapes
on
the
walls
and
ceiling
representing
evil
deeds
that
he
had
done
of
which
there
were
plenty
to
choose
from
i
could
make
no
shapes
on
his
brain
or
conscience
he
had
no
eyes
for
anything
but
gold
and
it
so
happened
that
his
nurse
had
neither
eyes
nor
heart
for
anything
else
either
day
as
she
was
seated
beside
his
bed
but
where
he
could
not
see
her
stirring
some
gruel
in
a
basin
to
cool
it
from
him
i
saw
her
take
a
little
phial
from
her
bosom
and
i
knew
by
the
expression
of
her
face
both
what
it
was
and
what
she
was
going
to
do
with
it
fortunately
the
cork
was
a
little
hard
to
get
out
and
this
gave
me
one
moment
to
think
the
room
was
so
crowded
with
all
sorts
of
things
that
although
there
were
no
curtains
on
the
bed
to
hide
from
the
miser
the
sight
of
his
precious
treasures
there
was
yet
but
one
small
part
of
the
ceiling
suitable
for
casting
myself
upon
in
the
shape
i
wished
to
assume
and
this
spot
was
hard
to
reach
but
having
discovered
that
upon
this
very
place
lay
a
dull
gleam
of
firelight
thrown
from
a
strange
old
dusty
mirror
that
stood
away
in
some
corner
i
got
in
front
of
the
fire
spied
where
the
mirror
was
threw
myself
upon
it
and
bounded
from
its
face
upon
the
oval
pool
of
dim
light
on
the
ceiling
assuming
as
i
passed
the
shape
of
an
old
stooping
hag
who
poured
something
from
a
phial
into
a
basin
i
made
the
handle
of
the
spoon
with
my
own
nose
ha
ha
and
the
caressed
the
of
the
before
the
resumed
the
old
miser
saw
me
he
would
not
taste
the
gruel
that
night
although
his
nurse
coaxed
and
scolded
till
they
were
both
weary
she
pretended
to
taste
it
herself
and
to
think
it
very
good
but
at
last
retired
into
a
corner
and
after
making
as
if
she
were
eating
it
took
good
care
to
pour
it
all
out
into
the
ashes
but
she
must
either
succeed
or
starve
him
at
last
interposed
a
shadow
i
will
tell
you
and
interposed
a
third
he
was
not
worth
saving
he
might
repent
suggested
another
who
was
more
benevolent
no
chance
of
that
returned
the
former
misers
never
do
the
love
of
money
has
less
in
it
to
cure
itself
than
any
other
wickedness
into
which
wretched
men
can
fall
what
a
mercy
it
is
to
be
born
a
shadow
wickedness
does
not
stick
to
us
what
do
we
care
for
gold
rubbish
amen
amen
amen
came
from
a
hundred
you
should
have
let
her
murder
him
and
so
you
would
have
been
quit
of
him
and
besides
how
was
he
to
escape
at
last
he
could
never
get
rid
of
her
you
know
i
was
going
to
tell
you
resumed
the
narrator
only
you
had
so
many
to
make
that
you
would
not
let
me
go
on
go
on
there
was
a
little
grandchild
who
used
to
come
and
see
him
sometimes
the
only
creature
the
miser
cared
for
her
mother
was
his
daughter
but
the
old
man
would
never
see
her
because
she
had
married
against
his
will
her
husband
was
now
dead
but
he
had
not
forgiven
her
yet
after
the
shadow
he
had
seen
however
he
said
to
himself
as
he
lay
awake
that
night
i
saw
the
words
on
his
face
shall
i
get
rid
of
that
old
devil
if
i
do
eat
i
shall
die
and
if
i
do
eat
i
shall
be
poisoned
i
wish
little
mary
would
come
ah
her
mother
would
never
have
served
me
so
he
lay
awake
thinking
such
things
over
and
over
again
all
night
long
and
i
stood
watching
him
from
a
dark
corner
till
the
dayspring
came
and
shook
me
out
when
i
came
back
next
night
the
room
was
tidy
and
clean
his
own
daughter
a
but
beautiful
woman
sat
by
his
bedside
and
little
mary
was
curled
up
on
the
floor
by
the
fire
imitating
us
by
making
queer
shadows
on
the
ceiling
with
her
twisted
hands
but
she
could
not
think
how
ever
they
got
there
and
no
wonder
for
i
helped
her
to
some
very
unaccountable
ones
i
have
a
story
about
a
granddaughter
too
said
another
the
moment
that
speaker
ceased
tell
it
tell
it
last
he
began
i
and
a
troop
of
us
set
out
in
the
twilight
to
find
some
house
where
we
could
all
have
something
to
do
for
we
had
made
up
our
minds
to
act
together
we
tried
several
but
found
objections
to
them
all
at
last
we
espied
a
large
lonely
and
hastening
to
it
we
found
great
preparations
making
for
the
christmas
dinner
we
rushed
into
it
scampered
all
over
it
and
made
up
our
minds
in
a
moment
that
it
would
do
we
amused
ourselves
in
the
nursery
first
where
there
were
several
children
being
dressed
for
dinner
we
generally
do
go
to
the
nursery
first
your
majesty
this
time
we
were
especially
charmed
with
a
little
girl
about
five
years
old
who
clapped
her
hands
and
danced
about
with
delight
at
the
antics
we
performed
and
we
said
we
would
do
something
for
her
if
we
had
a
chance
the
company
began
to
arrive
and
at
every
arrival
we
rushed
to
the
hall
and
cut
wonderful
capers
of
welcome
between
times
we
scudded
away
to
see
how
the
dressing
went
on
one
girl
about
eighteen
was
delightful
she
dressed
herself
as
if
she
did
not
care
much
about
it
but
could
not
help
doing
it
prettily
when
she
took
her
last
look
at
the
phantom
in
the
glass
she
half
smiled
to
but
do
not
like
those
creatures
that
come
into
the
mirrors
at
all
your
majesty
we
do
understand
them
they
are
dreadful
to
she
looked
rather
sad
and
pale
but
very
sweet
and
hopeful
so
we
wanted
to
know
all
about
her
and
soon
found
out
that
she
was
a
distant
relation
and
a
great
favourite
of
the
gentleman
of
the
house
an
old
man
in
whose
face
benevolence
was
mingled
with
obstinacy
and
a
deep
shade
of
the
tyrannical
we
could
not
admire
him
much
but
we
would
not
make
up
our
minds
all
at
once
shadows
never
do
the
rang
and
down
we
hurried
the
children
all
looked
happy
and
we
were
merry
but
there
was
one
cross
fellow
among
the
servants
and
did
we
plague
him
and
did
we
get
fun
out
of
him
when
he
was
bringing
up
dishes
we
lay
in
wait
for
him
at
every
corner
and
sprang
upon
him
from
the
floor
and
from
over
the
banisters
and
down
from
the
cornices
he
started
and
stumbled
and
blundered
so
in
consequence
that
his
thought
he
was
tipsy
once
he
dropped
a
plate
and
had
to
pick
up
the
pieces
and
hurry
away
with
them
and
did
we
pursue
him
as
he
went
it
was
lucky
for
him
his
master
did
not
see
how
he
went
on
but
we
took
care
not
to
let
him
get
into
any
real
scrape
though
he
was
quite
dazed
with
the
dodging
of
the
unaccountable
shadows
sometimes
he
thought
the
walls
were
coming
down
upon
him
sometimes
that
the
floor
was
gaping
to
swallow
him
sometimes
that
he
would
be
knocked
to
pieces
by
the
hurrying
to
and
fro
or
be
smothered
in
the
black
crowd
when
the
blazing
was
carried
in
we
made
a
perfect
about
it
dancing
and
mumming
in
the
blue
flames
like
mad
demons
and
how
the
children
screamed
with
delight
the
old
gentleman
who
was
very
fond
of
children
was
laughing
his
heartiest
laugh
when
a
loud
knock
came
to
the
the
fair
maiden
started
turned
paler
and
then
red
as
the
christmas
fire
i
saw
it
and
flung
my
hands
across
her
face
she
was
very
glad
and
i
know
she
said
in
her
heart
kind
shadow
which
paid
me
well
then
i
followed
the
rest
into
the
hall
and
found
there
a
jolly
handsome
sailor
evidently
a
son
of
the
house
the
old
man
received
him
with
tears
in
his
eyes
and
the
children
with
shouts
of
joy
the
maiden
escaped
in
the
confusion
just
in
time
to
save
herself
from
fainting
we
crowded
about
the
lamp
to
hide
her
retreat
and
nearly
put
it
out
and
the
butler
could
not
get
it
to
burn
up
before
she
had
glided
into
her
place
again
relieved
to
find
the
room
so
dark
the
sailor
only
had
seen
her
go
and
now
he
sat
down
beside
her
and
without
a
word
got
hold
of
her
hand
in
the
gloom
when
we
all
scattered
to
the
walls
and
the
corners
and
the
lamp
blazed
up
again
he
let
her
hand
go
during
the
rest
of
the
dinner
the
old
man
watched
the
two
and
saw
that
there
was
something
between
them
and
was
very
angry
for
he
was
an
important
man
in
his
own
estimation
and
they
had
never
consulted
him
the
fact
was
they
had
never
known
their
own
minds
till
the
sailor
had
gone
upon
his
last
voyage
and
had
learned
each
other
only
this
we
found
out
all
this
by
watching
them
and
then
talking
together
about
it
the
old
gentleman
saw
too
that
his
favourite
who
was
under
such
obligation
to
him
for
loving
her
so
much
loved
his
son
better
than
him
and
he
grew
by
degrees
so
jealous
that
he
overshadowed
the
whole
table
with
his
morose
looks
and
short
answers
that
kind
of
shadowing
is
very
different
from
ours
and
the
christmas
dessert
grew
so
gloomy
that
we
shadows
could
not
bear
it
and
were
delighted
when
the
ladies
rose
to
go
to
the
the
gentlemen
would
not
stay
behind
the
ladies
even
for
the
sake
of
the
wine
so
the
moody
host
notwithstanding
his
hospitality
was
left
alone
at
the
table
in
the
great
silent
room
we
followed
the
company
upstairs
to
the
and
thence
to
the
nursery
for
but
while
they
were
busy
with
this
most
shadowy
of
games
nearly
all
the
shadows
crept
downstairs
again
to
the
where
the
old
man
still
sat
gnawing
the
bone
of
his
own
selfishness
they
crowded
into
the
room
and
by
using
every
kind
of
expansion
blowing
themselves
out
like
they
succeeded
in
heaping
up
the
whole
room
with
shade
upon
shade
they
clustered
thickest
about
the
fire
and
the
lamp
till
at
last
they
almost
drowned
them
in
hills
of
darkness
before
they
had
accomplished
so
much
the
children
tired
with
fun
and
frolic
had
been
put
to
bed
but
the
little
girl
of
five
years
old
with
whom
we
had
been
so
pleased
when
first
we
arrived
could
not
go
to
sleep
she
had
a
little
room
of
her
own
and
i
had
watched
her
to
bed
and
now
kept
her
awake
by
gambolling
in
the
rays
of
the
when
her
eyes
were
once
fixed
upon
me
i
took
the
shape
of
her
grandfather
representing
him
on
the
wall
as
he
sat
in
his
chair
with
his
head
bent
down
and
his
arms
hanging
listlessly
by
his
sides
and
the
child
remembered
that
that
was
just
as
she
had
seen
him
last
for
she
had
happened
to
peep
in
at
the
door
after
all
the
rest
had
gone
upstairs
if
he
should
be
sitting
there
still
thought
she
alone
in
the
dark
she
scrambled
out
of
bed
and
crept
down
meantime
the
others
had
made
the
room
below
so
dark
that
only
the
face
and
white
hair
of
the
old
man
could
be
dimly
discerned
in
the
shadowy
crowd
for
he
had
filled
his
own
mind
with
shadows
which
we
shadows
wanted
to
draw
out
of
him
those
shadows
are
very
different
from
us
your
majesty
knows
he
was
thinking
of
all
the
disappointments
he
had
had
in
life
and
of
all
the
ingratitude
he
had
met
with
and
he
thought
far
more
of
the
good
he
had
done
than
the
good
others
had
got
all
i
have
done
for
them
said
he
with
a
sigh
of
bitterness
one
of
them
cares
a
straw
for
me
my
own
children
will
be
glad
when
i
am
gone
at
that
instant
he
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
saw
standing
close
by
the
door
a
tiny
figure
in
a
long
the
door
behind
her
was
shut
it
was
my
little
friend
who
had
crept
in
noiselessly
a
pang
of
icy
fear
shot
to
the
old
man
heart
but
it
melted
away
as
fast
for
we
made
a
lane
through
us
for
a
single
ray
from
the
fire
to
fall
on
the
face
of
the
little
sprite
and
he
thought
it
was
a
child
of
his
own
that
had
died
when
just
the
age
of
her
who
now
stood
looking
for
her
grandfather
among
the
shadows
he
thought
she
had
come
out
of
her
grave
in
the
cold
darkness
to
ask
why
her
father
was
sitting
alone
on
and
he
felt
he
had
no
answer
to
give
his
little
ghost
but
one
he
would
be
ashamed
for
her
to
hear
but
his
grandchild
saw
him
now
and
walked
up
to
him
with
a
childish
stateliness
stumbling
once
or
twice
on
what
seemed
her
long
shroud
pushing
through
the
crowded
shadows
she
reached
him
climbed
upon
his
knee
laid
her
little
head
on
his
shoulders
and
said
you
goomy
is
it
your
too
ganpa
a
new
fount
of
love
seemed
to
burst
from
the
clay
of
the
old
heart
he
clasped
the
child
to
his
bosom
and
wept
then
without
a
word
he
rose
with
her
in
his
arms
carried
her
up
to
her
room
and
laying
her
down
in
her
bed
covered
her
up
kissed
her
sweet
little
mouth
unconscious
of
reproof
and
then
went
to
the
as
soon
as
he
entered
he
saw
the
culprits
in
a
quiet
corner
alone
he
went
up
to
them
took
a
hand
of
each
and
joining
them
in
both
his
said
bless
you
then
he
turned
to
the
rest
of
the
company
and
said
he
have
a
christmas
carol
and
well
he
might
for
though
i
have
paid
many
visits
to
the
house
i
have
never
seen
him
cross
since
and
i
am
sure
that
must
cost
him
a
good
deal
of
trouble
we
have
just
come
from
a
great
palace
said
another
where
we
knew
there
were
many
children
and
where
we
thought
to
hear
glad
voices
and
see
royally
merry
looks
but
as
soon
as
we
entered
we
became
aware
that
one
mighty
shadow
shrouded
the
whole
and
that
shadow
deepened
and
deepened
till
it
gathered
in
darkness
about
the
reposing
form
of
a
wise
prince
when
we
saw
him
we
could
move
no
more
but
clung
heavily
to
the
walls
and
by
our
stillness
added
to
the
sorrow
of
the
hour
and
when
we
saw
the
mother
of
her
people
weeping
with
bowed
head
for
the
loss
of
him
in
whom
she
had
trusted
we
were
seized
with
such
a
longing
to
be
shadows
no
more
but
winged
angels
which
are
the
white
shadows
cast
in
heaven
from
the
light
of
light
so
as
to
gather
around
her
and
hover
over
her
with
comforting
that
we
vanished
from
the
walls
and
found
ourselves
floating
high
above
the
towers
of
the
palace
where
we
met
the
angels
on
their
way
and
knew
that
our
service
was
not
needed
by
this
time
there
was
a
glimmer
of
approaching
moonlight
and
the
king
began
to
see
several
of
those
stranger
shadows
with
human
faces
and
eyes
moving
about
amongst
the
crowd
he
knew
at
once
that
they
did
not
belong
to
his
dominion
they
looked
at
him
and
came
near
him
and
passed
slowly
but
they
never
made
any
obeisance
or
gave
sign
of
homage
and
what
their
eyes
said
to
him
the
king
only
could
tell
and
he
did
not
tell
what
are
those
other
shadows
that
move
through
the
crowd
said
he
to
one
of
his
subjects
near
him
the
shadow
started
looked
round
shivered
slightly
and
laid
his
finger
on
his
lips
then
leading
the
king
a
little
aside
and
looking
carefully
about
him
once
more
i
do
not
know
said
he
in
a
low
tone
what
they
are
i
have
heard
of
them
often
but
only
once
did
i
ever
see
any
of
them
before
that
was
when
some
of
us
one
night
paid
a
visit
to
a
man
who
sat
much
alone
and
was
said
to
think
a
great
deal
we
saw
two
of
those
sitting
in
the
room
with
him
and
he
was
as
pale
as
they
were
we
could
not
cross
the
threshold
but
shivered
and
shook
and
felt
ready
to
melt
away
is
not
your
majesty
afraid
of
them
too
but
the
king
made
no
answer
and
before
he
could
speak
again
the
moon
had
climbed
above
the
mighty
pillars
of
the
church
of
the
shadows
and
looked
in
at
the
great
window
of
the
sky
the
shapes
had
all
vanished
and
the
king
again
lifting
up
his
eyes
saw
but
the
wall
of
his
own
chamber
on
which
flickered
the
shadow
of
a
little
child
he
looked
down
and
there
sitting
on
a
stool
by
the
fire
he
saw
one
of
his
own
little
ones
waiting
to
say
to
his
father
and
go
to
bed
early
that
he
might
rise
early
too
and
be
very
good
and
happy
all
and
ralph
rinkelmann
rejoiced
that
he
was
a
man
and
not
a
shadow
but
as
the
shadows
vanished
they
left
the
sense
of
song
in
the
brain
and
the
words
of
their
song
must
have
been
something
like
these
shadows
shadows
shadows
all
shadow
birth
and
funeral
shadow
moons
gleam
overhead
over
we
tread
lives
grows
and
dies
from
entices
on
to
on
closing
up
the
with
a
thou
art
a
gloom
cast
upon
a
through
the
endless
shadow
air
from
the
shadow
sitting
there
on
a
moveless
glooming
through
the
ages
gone
north
and
south
and
in
and
out
east
and
west
and
all
about
flinging
shadows
everywhere
on
the
air
thou
hast
no
story
nothing
but
a
but
ralph
rinkelmann
said
to
himself
they
are
but
shadows
that
sing
thus
for
a
shadow
can
see
but
shadows
a
man
sees
a
man
where
a
shadow
sees
only
a
shadow
and
he
was
comforted
in
himself
