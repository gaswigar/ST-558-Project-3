the
foregoing
sentence
set
up
in
type
always
so
constantly
does
it
come
tripping
off
the
pens
of
all
reviewers
nor
ever
do
i
read
it
without
a
fresh
thrill
of
respect
for
the
young
stevenson
i
in
my
own
very
inferior
boyhood
found
it
hard
to
revel
in
so
much
as
a
single
page
of
any
writer
earlier
than
thackeray
this
disability
i
did
not
shake
off
alas
after
i
left
school
there
seemed
to
be
so
many
live
authors
worth
reading
i
gave
precedence
to
them
and
not
being
much
of
a
reader
never
had
time
to
grapple
with
the
old
masters
meanwhile
i
was
already
writing
a
little
on
my
own
account
i
had
had
some
sort
of
aptitude
for
latin
prose
and
latin
verse
i
wondered
often
whether
those
two
things
essential
though
they
were
and
are
to
the
making
of
a
decent
style
in
english
prose
sufficed
for
the
making
of
a
style
more
than
decent
i
felt
that
i
must
have
other
models
and
thus
i
acquired
the
habit
of
aping
now
and
again
quite
sedulously
this
or
that
live
writer
sometimes
it
must
be
admitted
in
the
hope
of
learning
rather
what
to
avoid
i
acquired
too
the
habit
of
publishing
these
patient
little
efforts
some
of
them
appeared
in
the
saturday
review
many
years
ago
others
appeared
there
more
recently
i
have
selected

kind

the
editor

the
earlier
lot
and

from
the
later

other
nine
in
this
book

printed
for
the
first

the

itself
may
be
taken
as

the
mote
in
the
middle
distance
it
was
with
the
sense
of
a
for
him
very
memorable
something
that
he
peered
now
into
the
immediate
future
and
tried
not
without
compunction
to
take
that
period
up
where
he
had
prospectively
left
it
but
just
where
the
deuce
he
left
it
the
consciousness
of
dubiety
was
for
our
friend
not
this
morning
quite
yet
enough
to
outline
the
figures
on
what
she
had
called
his
horizon
between
which
and
himself
the
twilight
was
indeed
of
a
quality
somewhat
intimidating
he
had
run
up
in
the
course
of
time
against
a
good
number
of
teasers
and
the
function
of
teasing
them
back
of
as
it
were
giving
them
every
now
and
then
what
for
was
in
him
so
much
a
habit
that
he
would
have
been
at
a
loss
had
there
been
on
the
face
of
it
nothing
to
lose
oh
he
always
had
offered
rewards
of
course
had
ever
so
liberally
pasted
the
windows
of
his
soul
with
staring
appeals
minute
descriptions
promises
that
knew
no
bounds
but
the
actual
recovery
of
the
article
the
business
of
drawing
and
crossing
the
cheque
blotched
though
this
were
with
tears
of
joy
had
blankly
appeared
to
him
rather
in
the
light
of
a
sacrilege
casting
he
sometimes
felt
a
palpable
chill
on
the
fervour
of
the
next
quest
it
was
just
this
fervour
that
was
threatened
as
raising
himself
on
his
elbow
he
stared
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
that
his
eyes
refused
to
rest
there
for
more
than
the
fraction
of
an
instant
may
be
taken
even
then
taken
by
keith
tantalus
as
a
hint
of
his
recollection
that
after
all
the
phenomenon
was
to
be
singular
thus
the
exact
repetition
at
the
foot
of
eva
bed
of
the
shape
pendulous
at
the
foot
of
was
hardly
enough
to
account
for
the
fixity
with
which
he
envisaged
it
and
for
which
he
was
to
find
some
years
later
a
motive
in
the
as
it
turned
out
hardly
generous
fear
that
eva
had
already
made
the
great
investigation
on
her
own
her
very
regular
breathing
presently
reassured
him
that
if
she
peeped
into
her
stocking
she
must
have
done
so
in
sleep
whether
he
should
wake
her
now
or
wait
for
their
nurse
to
wake
them
both
in
due
course
was
a
problem
presently
solved
by
a
new
development
it
was
plain
that
his
sister
was
now
watching
him
between
her
eyelashes
he
had
half
expected
that
she
really
was
he
had
often
told
her
that
she
really
was
magnificent
and
her
magnificence
was
never
more
obvious
than
in
the
pause
that
elapsed
before
she
all
of
a
sudden
remarked
they
so
very
indubitably
you
know
it
occurred
to
him
as
befitting
eva
remoteness
which
was
a
part
of
eva
magnificence
that
her
voice
emerged
somewhat
muffled
by
the
bedclothes
she
was
ever
indeed
the
most
telephonic
of
her
sex
in
talking
to
eva
you
always
had
as
it
were
your
lips
to
the
receiver
if
you
did
try
to
meet
her
fine
eyes
it
was
that
you
simply
could
hope
to
there
were
too
many
dark
too
many
buzzing
and
bewildering
and
all
frankly
not
negotiable
leagues
in
between
snatches
of
other
voices
seemed
often
to
intertrude
themselves
in
the
parley
and
your
loyal
effort
not
to
overhear
these
was
complicated
by
your
fear
of
missing
what
eva
might
be
twittering
oh
you
certainly
have
my
dear
the
trick
of
propinquity
was
a
thrust
she
had
once
parried
by
saying
that
in
that
case
had
to
which
his
unspoken
rejoinder
that
she
had
caught
her
tone
from
the
peevish
young
women
at
the
central
seemed
to
him
if
not
perhaps
in
the
last
certainly
in
the
last
but
one
analysis
to
lack
finality
with
eva
he
had
found
it
was
always
safest
to
ring
off
it
was
with
a
certain
sense
of
his
rashness
in
the
matter
therefore
that
he
now
with
an
air
of
feverishly
holding
the
line
said
oh
as
to
that
had
he
presently
asked
himself
rung
off
it
was
characteristic
of
our
friend
was
indeed
him
all
over
that
his
fear
of
what
she
was
going
to
say
was
as
nothing
to
his
fear
of
what
she
might
be
going
to
leave
unsaid
he
had
in
his
converse
with
her
been
never
so
conscious
as
now
of
the
intervening
leagues
they
had
never
so
insistently
beaten
the
drum
of
his
ear
and
he
caught
himself
in
the
act
of
awfully
computing
with
a
certain
statistical
passion
the
distance
between
rome
and
boston
he
has
never
been
able
to
decide
which
of
these
points
he
was
psychically
the
nearer
to
at
the
moment
when
eva
replying
well
one
does
anyhow
leave
a
margin
for
the
pretext
you
know
made
him
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
wonder
whether
she
were
not
more
magnificent
than
even
he
had
ever
given
her
credit
for
being
perhaps
it
was
to
test
this
theory
or
perhaps
merely
to
gain
time
that
he
now
raised
himself
to
his
knees
and
leaning
with
outstretched
arm
towards
the
foot
of
his
bed
made
as
though
to
touch
the
stocking
which
santa
claus
had
overnight
left
dangling
there
his
posture
as
he
stared
obliquely
at
eva
with
a
sort
of
beaming
defiance
recalled
to
him
something
seen
in
an
illustration
this
reminiscence
however
if
such
it
was
save
in
the
scarred
the
poor
dear
old
woebegone
and
so
very
beguilingly
refractive
mirror
of
the
moment
took
a
peculiar
twist
from
behaviour
she
had
with
startling
suddenness
sat
bolt
upright
and
looked
to
him
as
if
she
were
overhearing
some
tragedy
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire
where
in
the
nature
of
things
she
was
unable
to
arrest
it
the
gaze
she
fixed
on
her
extravagant
kinsman
was
of
a
kind
to
make
him
wonder
how
he
contrived
to
remain
as
he
beautifully
did
rigid
his
prop
was
possibly
the
reflection
that
flashed
on
him
that
if
abounded
in
attenuations
well
hang
it
all
so
did
it
was
simply
a
difference
of
plane
readjust
the
values
as
painters
say
and
there
you
were
he
was
to
feel
that
he
was
only
too
crudely
there
when
leaning
further
forward
he
laid
a
chubby
forefinger
on
the
stocking
causing
that
receptacle
to
rock
ponderously
to
and
fro
this
effect
was
more
expected
than
the
tears
which
started
to
eyes
and
the
intensity
with
which
do
you
she
exclaimed
see
the
mote
in
the
middle
distance
he
asked
did
you
ever
my
dear
know
me
to
see
anything
else
i
tell
you
it
blocks
out
everything
it
a
cathedral
it
a
herd
of
elephants
it
the
whole
habitable
globe
oh
it
believe
me
of
an
obsessiveness
but
his
sense
of
the
one
thing
it
block
out
from
his
purview
enabled
him
to
launch
at
eva
a
speculation
as
to
just
how
far
santa
claus
had
for
the
particular
occasion
gone
the
gauge
for
both
of
them
of
this
seasonable
distance
seemed
almost
blatantly
suspended
in
the
silhouettes
of
the
two
stockings
over
and
above
the
basis
of
presumably
sweetmeats
in
the
toes
and
heels
certain
extrusions
stood
for
a
very
plenary
fulfilment
of
desire
and
since
eva
had
set
her
heart
on
a
doll
of
ample
proportions
and
practicable
eyelids
had
asked
that
most
admirable
of
her
sex
their
mother
for
it
with
not
less
directness
than
he
himself
had
put
into
his
demand
for
a
sword
and
helmet
her
coyness
now
struck
keith
as
lying
near
to
at
indeed
a
hardly
measurable
distance
from
the
of
his
patience
if
she
did
want
the
doll
why
the
deuce
had
she
made
such
a
point
of
getting
it
he
was
perhaps
on
the
verge
of
putting
this
question
to
her
when
waving
her
hand
to
include
both
stockings
she
said
of
course
my
dear
you
see
there
they
are
and
you
know
i
know
you
know
we
would
either
of
us
dip
a
finger
into
them
with
a
vibrancy
of
tone
that
seemed
to
bring
her
voice
quite
close
to
him
one
does
she
added
violate
the
shrine
pick
the
pearl
from
the
shell
even
had
the
answering
question
does
one
just
which
for
an
instant
hovered
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
been
uttered
it
could
not
have
obscured
for
keith
the
change
which
her
magnificence
had
wrought
in
him
something
perhaps
of
the
bigotry
of
the
convert
was
already
discernible
in
the
way
that
averting
his
eyes
he
said
one
even
peer
as
to
whether
in
the
years
that
have
elapsed
since
he
said
this
either
of
our
friends
now
adult
has
in
fact
peered
is
a
question
which
whenever
i
call
at
the
house
i
am
tempted
to
put
to
one
or
other
of
them
but
any
regret
i
may
feel
in
my
invariable
failure
to
come
up
to
the
scratch
of
yielding
to
this
temptation
is
balanced
for
me
by
my
impression
my
sometimes
all
but
throned
and
anointed
certainty
that
the
answer
if
vouchsafed
would
be
in
the
negative

next
morning
sharp
round
a
corner
on
the
way
home
i
collided
with
something
firmer
than
the
regulation
i
righted
myself
after
the
recoil
and
saw
some
stars
that
were
very
pretty
indeed
then
i
perceived
the
nature
of
the
obstruction
evening
judlip
i
said
sweetly
when
i
had
collected
my
hat
from
the
gutter

many
were
the
i
had
been
privileged
to
walk
with
judlip
imbibing
curious
lore
that
made
glad
the
civilian
heart
of
me
seven
whole
inch
had
i
pitmanised
to
the
brim
with
judlip
and
now
to
be
repulsed
as
one
of
the
uninitiated
it
hurt
horrid
there
is
a
thing
called
dignity
small
boys
sometimes
stand
on
it
then
they
have
to
be
kicked
then
they
get
down

i
asked
more
sweetly
than
ever

blank
yuss
drawn
a
blank
blank
blank
so
much
as
a
kick
at
a
lorst
dorg
christmas
eve
ai
wot
it
was
i
felt
for
my
lawd
i
remembers
the
time
when
the
drunks
and
disorderlies
down
this
street
was
as
thick
as
flies
on
a
one
just
picked
orf
with
one
finger
and
thumb
a
bloomin
battew
that
wot
it
wos
the
night
yet
young
judlip
i
insinuated
with
a
jerk
of
my
thumb
at
the
flaring
windows
of
the
rat
and
blood
hound
at
that
moment
the
swung
open
emitting
a
man
and
woman
who
walked
with
linked
arms
and
exceeding
great
care
judlip
eyed
them
longingly
as
they
tacked
up
the
street
then
he
sighed
now
when
judlip
sighs
the
sound
is
like
unto
that
which
issues
from
the
vent
of
a
crosby
boiler
when
the
are
at
come
judlip
i
said
possess
your
soul
in
patience
you
soon
find
someone
to
make
an
example
of
meanwhile
i
threw
back
my
head
and
smacked
my
lips
the
usual
judlip
in
another
minute
i
emerged
through
the
bearing
a
furtive
glass
of
that
same
usual
and
nipped
down
the
mews
where
my
friend
was
wont
to
await
these
little
tokens
of
esteem
to
the
majesty
of
the
law
judlip
when
he
had
honoured
the
toast
i
scooted
back
with
the
glass
leaving
him
wiping
the
beads
off
his
he
was
in
his
philosophic
mood
when
i
rejoined
him
at
the
corner

he
had
broken
off
and
was
peering
fixedly
upwards
at
an
angle
of
across
the
moonlit
street
ullo
he
said
in
a
hoarse
whisper
striking
an
average
between
the
direction
of
his
eyes
for
judlip
when
on
the
job
has
a
squint
i
perceived
someone
in
the
act
of
emerging
from
a
judlip
voice
clove
the
silence
wot

there
the
person
addressed
came
to
the
edge
of
the
parapet
i
saw
then
that
he
had
a
hoary
white
beard
a
red
ulster
with
the
hood
up
and
what
looked
like
a
sack
over
his
shoulder
he
said
something
or
other
in
a
voice
like
a
concertina
that
has
been
left
out
in

i
dessay
answered
my

just
you

the
old
man
nodded
and
smiled
then
as
i
hope
to
be
saved
he
came
floating
gently
down
through
the
moonlight
with
the
sack
over
his
shoulder
and
a
young
clasped
to
his
chest
he
alighted
in
a
friendly
manner
on
the
curb
beside
us
judlip
was
the
first
to
recover
himself
out
went
his
right
arm
and
the
airman
was
slung
round
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
spilling
his
sack
in
the
road
i
made
a
for
his
burglar
or
no

he
was
the
best
airman
out
and
i
was
muchly
desirous
to
know
the
precise
nature
of
the
apparatus
under
his
ulster
a
from
judlip
left
caused
me
to
hop
quickly
aside
the
prisoner
was
squealing

chapter
christmas
more
and
more
as
the
tranquil
years
went
by
percy
found
himself
able
to
draw
a
quiet
satisfaction
from
the
regularity
the
even
sureness
with
which
in
every
year
one
season
succeeded
to
another
in
boyhood
he
had
felt
always
a
little
sad
at
the
approach
of
autumn
the
yellowing
leaves
of
the
lime
trees
the
creeper
that
flushed
to
so
deep
a
crimson
against
the
old
grey
walls
the
chrysanthemums
that
shed
so
prodigally
their
petals
on
the
smooth
green
lawn
all
these
things
beautiful
and
wonderful
though
they
were
were
somehow
a
little
melancholy
also
as
being
signs
of
the
year
decay
once
when
he
was
fourteen
or
fifteen
years
old
he
had
overheard
a
friend
of
the
family
say
to
his
father
how
the
days
are
drawing
in
a
remark
which
set
him
thinking
deeply
with
an
almost
morbid
abandonment
to
gloom
for
quite
a
long
time
he
had
not
then
grasped
the
truth
that
in
exactly
the
proportion
in
which
the
days
draw
in
they
will
in
the
fullness
of
time
draw
out
this
was
a
lesson
that
he
mastered
in
later
years
and
though
the
waning
of
summer
never
failed
to
touch
him
with
the
sense
of
an
almost
personal
loss
yet
it
seemed
to
him
a
right
thing
a
wise
ordination
that
there
should
be
these
recurring
changes
those
men
and
women
of
whom
the
poet
tells
us
that
they
lived
in
a
land
where
it
was
always
afternoon
could
they
percy
often
wondered
have
felt
quite
that
thankfulness
which
on
a
fine
afternoon
is
felt
by
us
dwellers
in
ordinary
climes
ah
no
surely
it
is
because
we
are
made
acquainted
with
the
grey
sadness
of
twilight
the
solemn
majesty
of
the
the
faint
chill
of
the
dawn
that
we
set
so
high
a
value
on
the
more
meridional
hours
if
there
were
no
autumn
no
winter
then
spring
and
summer
would
lose
not
all
indeed
yet
an
appreciable
part
of
their
sweet
savour
for
us
thus
as
his
mind
matured
percy
came
to
be
very
glad
of
the
gradual
changes
of
the
year
he
found
in
them
a
rhythm
as
he
once
described
it
in
his
diary
and
this
he
liked
very
much
indeed
he
was
aware
that
in
his
own
character
with
its
tendency
to
waywardness
to
caprice
to
disorder
there
was
an
almost
grievous
lack
of
this
quality
in
the
sure
and
seemly
progression
of
the
months
was
there
not
for
him
a
desirable
exemplar
a
needed
corrective
he
was
so
liable
to
moods
in
which
he
rebelled
against
the
performance
of
some
quite
simple
duty
some
appointed
task
moods
in
which
he
said
to
himself
it
i
will
not
do
this
or
oh
i
shall
not
do
that
but
it
was
clear
that
nature
herself
never
spoke
thus
even
as
a
passenger
in
a
frail
barque
on
the
troublous
ocean
will
keep
his
eyes
directed
towards
some
upstanding
rock
on
the
far
horizon
finding
thus
inwardly
for
himself
or
hoping
to
find
a
more
stable
equilibrium
a
deeper
tranquillity
than
is
his
so
did
percy
daily
devote
a
certain
portion
of
his
time
to
quiet
communion
with
the
almanac
there
were
times
when
he
was
sorely
tempted
to
regret
a
little
that
some
of
the
feasts
of
the
church
were
moveable
true
they
moved
only
within
strictly
prescribed
limits
and
in
accordance
with
certain
unalterable
wholly
justifiable
rules
yet
in
the
very
fact
that
they
did
move
there
seemed
to
use
an
expressive
slang
phrase
of
the
day
something
not
quite
nice
it
was
therefore
the
fixed
feasts
that
pleased
percy
best
and
on
christmas
day
especially
he
experienced
a
temperate
glow
which
would
have
perhaps
surprised
those
who
knew
him
only
slightly
by
reason
of
the
athletic
exercises
of
his
earlier
years
percy
had
retained
in
middle
life
a
certain
lightness
and
firmness
of
tread
and
this
on
christmas
morning
between
his
rooms
and
the
cathedral
was
always
so
peculiarly
elastic
that
he
might
almost
have
seemed
to
be
rather
running
than
walking
the
ancient
fane
with
its
soarings
of
grey
columns
to
the
dimness
of
its
embowed
roof
the
delicate
traceries
of
the
organ
screen
the
swelling
notes
of
the
organ
the
mellow
shafts
of
light
filtered
through
the
windows
whose
hues
were
as
those
of
emeralds
and
rubies
and
amethysts
the
stainless
purity
of
the
surplices
of
clergy
and
choir
the
sober
richness
of
sunday
bonnets
in
the
transept
the
faint
yet
heavy
fragrance
exhaled
from
the
pipes
all
these
familiar
things
appealing
as
he
sometimes
felt
almost
too
strongly
to
that
sensuous
side
of
his
nature
which
made
him
so
susceptible
to
the
paintings
of
leader
of
sir
luke
fildes
were
on
christmas
morning
more
than
usually
affecting
by
reason
of
that
note
of
quiet
joyousness
of
peace
and
good
will
that
pervaded
the
lessons
of
the
day
the
collect
the
hymns
the
sermon
it
was
this
spiritual
aspect
of
christmas
that
percy
felt
to
be
hardly
sufficiently
regarded
or
at
least
dwelt
on
nowadays
and
he
sometimes
wondered
whether
the
modern
christmas
had
not
been
in
some
degree
inspired
and
informed
by
charles
dickens
he
had
for
that
writer
a
very
sincere
admiration
though
he
was
inclined
to
think
that
his
true
excellence
lay
not
so
much
in
faithful
portrayal
of
the
life
of
his
times
or
in
gift
of
sustained
narration
or
in
those
scenes
of
pathos
which
have
moved
so
many
hearts
in
so
many
quiet
homes
as
in
the
power
of
inventing
highly
fantastic
figures
such
as
micawber
or
pickwick
this
view
percy
knew
to
be
somewhat
heretical
and
constitutionally
averse
from
the
danger
of
being
suspected
of
talking
for
effect
he
kept
it
to
himself
but
had
anyone
challenged
him
to
give
his
opinion
it
was
thus
that
he
would
have
expressed
himself
in
regard
to
christmas
he
could
not
help
wishing
that
charles
dickens
had
laid
more
stress
on
its
spiritual
element
it
was
right
that
the
feast
should
be
an
occasion
for
good
cheer
for
the
savoury
meats
the
steaming
bowl
the
blazing
log
the
traditional
games
but
was
not
the
modern
world
with
its
almost
avowed
bias
towards
materialism
too
little
apt
to
think
of
christmas
as
also
a
time
for
meditation
for
taking
stock
as
it
were
of
the
things
of
the
soul
percy
had
heard
that
in
london
nowadays
there
was
a
class
of
people
who
sate
down
to
their
christmas
dinners
in
public
hotels
he
did
not
condemn
this
practice
he
never
condemned
a
thing
but
wondered
rather
whether
it
were
right
and
could
not
help
feeling
that
somehow
it
was
not
in
the
course
of
his
rare
visits
to
london
he
had
more
than
once
been
inside
of
one
of
the
large
new
hotels
that
had
sprung
up
these
great
caravanseries
as
he
described
them
in
a
letter
to
an
old
who
had
been
engaged
for
many
years
in
chinese
mission
work
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
true
spirit
of
christmas
could
hardly
be
acclimatised
in
such
places
but
found
its
proper
in
quiet
detached
homes
where
were
gathered
together
only
those
connected
with
one
another
by
ties
of
kinship
or
of
long
and
tested
friendship
he
sometimes
blamed
himself
for
having
tended
more
and
more
as
the
quiet
peaceful
tranquil
years
went
by
to
absent
himself
from
even
those
small
domestic
gatherings
and
yet
might
it
not
be
that
his
instinct
for
solitude
at
this
season
was
a
right
instinct
at
least
for
him
and
that
to
run
counter
to
it
would
be
in
some
degree
unacceptable
to
the
power
that
fashioned
us
thus
he
allowed
himself
to
go
as
it
were
his
own
way
after
morning
service
he
sate
down
to
his
christmas
fare
alone
and
then
when
the
simple
meal
was
over
would
sit
and
think
in
his
accustomed
chair
falling
perhaps
into
one
of
those
quiet
dozes
from
which
because
they
seemed
to
be
so
natural
a
result
so
seemly
a
consummation
of
his
thoughts
he
did
not
regularly
abstain
later
he
sallied
forth
with
a
sense
of
refreshment
for
a
brisk
walk
among
the
fens
the
sedges
the
hedgerows
the
pools
the
pollard
willows
that
would
in
due
course
be
putting
forth
their
tender
shoots
of
palest
green
and
then
once
more
in
his
rooms
with
the
curtains
drawn
and
the
candles
lit
he
would
turn
to
his
and
choose
from
among
them
some
old
book
that
he
knew
and
loved
or
maybe
some
quite
new
book
by
that
writer
whose
works
were
most
dear
to
him
because
in
them
he
seemed
always
to
know
so
precisely
what
the
author
would
say
next
and
because
he
found
in
their
repetitions
a
singular
repose
a
sense
of
security
an
earnest
of
calm
and
continuity
as
though
he
were
reading
over
again
one
of
those
wise
that
he
had
so
loved
in
boyhood
or
were
listening
to
the
sounds
made
on
a
piano
by
some
modest
very
conscientious
young
girl
with
a
pale
red
practising
her
scales
very
gently

chapter
xx
it
was
the
christmas
party
at
heighton
that
was
one
of
the
in
perkins
life
the
duchess
had
sent
him
a
wire
in
the
hyperbolical
style
of
her
class
conveying
a
vague
impression
that
she
and
the
duke
had
arranged
to
commit
suicide
together
if
perkins
did
chuck
any
previous
engagement
he
had
made
and
perkins
had
felt
in
a
slipshod
sort
of
way
for
at
this
period
he
was
incapable
of
ordered
thought
he
might
as
well
be
at
heighton
as
anywhere
the
enormous
house
was
almost
full
there
must
have
been
upwards
of
fifty
people
sitting
down
to
every
meal
many
of
these
were
members
of
the
family
perkins
was
able
to
recognise
them
by
their
unconvoluted
ears
the
grifford
ear
transmitted
from
one
generation
to
another
for
the
rest
there
were
the
usual
lot
from
the
front
benches
and
the
embassies
evesham
was
there
clutching
at
the
lapels
of
his
coat
and
the
prescotts
he
with
his
massive
mask
of
a
face
and
she
with
her
quick
ways
talking
about
two
things
at
a
time
old
tommy
strickland
with
his
monocle
and
his
dropped
g
telling
you
what
he
had
once
said
to
disraeli
boubou
seaforth
and
his
american
wife
john
pirram
ardent
and
elegant
spouting
old
french
lyrics
and
a
score
of
others
perkins
had
got
used
to
them
by
now
he
no
longer
wondered
what
they
were
up
to
for
he
knew
they
were
up
to
nothing
whatever
he
reflected
while
he
was
dressing
for
dinner
on
christmas
night
how
odd
it
was
he
had
ever
thought
of
using
them
he
might
as
well
have
hoped
to
use
the
dresden
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
that
grinned
out
in
the
last
stages
of
refinement
at
him
from
the
glazed
cabinets
in
the
or
the
labour
members
themselves
true
there
was
evesham
he
had
shown
an
exquisitely
open
mind
about
the
whole
thing
he
had
at
once
grasped
the
underlying
principles
thrown
out
some
amazingly
luminous
suggestions
oh
yes
evesham
was
a
statesman
right
enough
but
had
even
he
ever
really
in
the
idea
of
a
provisional
government
of
england
by
the
female
foundlings
to
perkins
the
whole
thing
had
seemed
so
simple
so
imminent
a
thing
that
needed
only
a
little
general
to
bring
it
about
and
now
suppose
his
bill
passed
its
second
reading
suppose
it
had
become
law
would
this
poor
old
england
be
by
way
of
functioning
decently
after
all
foundlings
were
sometimes
naughty
what
was
the
matter
with
the
whole
human
race
he
remembered
again
those
words
of
scragson
that
had
had
such
a
depressing
effect
on
him
at
the
cambridge
union
look
here
you
know
it
all
a
huge
nasty
mess
and
we
trying
to
swab
it
up
with
a
pocket
handkerchief
well
he
given
up
trying
to
do
that
during
dinner
his
eyes
wandered
furtively
up
and
down
the
endless
ornate
table
and
he
felt
he
had
been
in
a
sort
of
way
right
in
thinking
these
people
were
the
handiest
instrument
to
prise
open
the
national
conscience
with
the
shining
red
faces
of
the
men
the
shining
white
necks
and
arms
of
the
women
the
fearless
eyes
the
general
and
spaciousness
the
look
of
late
hours
counteracted
by
fresh
air
and
exercise
and
the
best
things
to
eat
and
drink
what
might
be
made
of
these
people
if
they
only
submit
perkins
looked
behind
them
at
the
solemn
young
footmen
passing
and
repassing
noiselessly
in

and

it
was
just
because
they
had
been
able
to
that
they
were

perkins
under
his
breath
one
of
the
big
conifers
from
the
park
had
been
erected
in
the
hall
and
this
after
dinner
was
found
to
be
all
lighted
up
with
electric
bulbs
and
hung
with
packages
in
tissue
paper
the
duchess
stood
a
bright
feral
figure
distributing
these
packages
to
the
guests
perkins
name
was
called
out
in
due
course
and
the
package
addressed
to
him
was
slipped
into
his
hand
he
retired
with
it
into
a
corner
inside
the
was
a
small
morocco
leather
case
inside
that
was
a
set
of
diamond
and
sapphire
large
ones
he
stood
looking
at
them
blinking
a
little
he
supposed
he
must
put
them
on
but
something
in
him
some
intractably
tough
bit
of
his
old
self
rose
up
protesting
frantically
if
he
could
use
these
people
at
least
they
were
going
to
use
no
damn
it
he
said
under
his
breath
and
thrusting
the
case
into
his
pocket
slipped
away
unobserved
he
flung
himself
into
a
chair
in
his
bedroom
and
puffed
a
blast
of
air
from
his
lungs
yes
it
had
been
a
narrow
escape
he
knew
that
if
he
had
put
those
beastly
blue
and
white
things
on
he
would
have
been
a
lost
soul
you
got
to
pull
yourself
together
hear
he
said
to
himself
you
got
to
do
a
lot
of
clear
steady
merciless
thinking
now
you
got
to
persuade
yourself
somehow
that
foundlings
or
no
foundlings
this
regeneration
of
mankind
business
may
still
be
set
going
and
by
he
paced
up
and
down
the
room
fuming
how
recapture
the
generous
certitudes
that
had
one
by
one
been
slipping
away
from
him
he
found
himself
staring
vacantly
at
the
row
of
books
on
the
little
shelf
by
his
bed
one
of
them
seemed
suddenly
to
detach
itself
he
could
almost
have
sworn
afterwards
that
he
did
reach
out
for
it
but
that
it
hopped
down
into
his
hand
sitting
up
for
the
dawn
it
was
one
of
that
sociological
series
by
which
had
first
touched
his
soul
to
finer
issues
when
he
was
at
the
he
opened
it
with
tremulous
fingers
could
it
its
old
sway
over
him
now
the
page
he
had
opened
it
at
was
headed
general
cessation
day
and
he
began
to
read
the
of
the
calendar
on
a
decimal
basis
seems
a
simple
enough
matter
at
first
sight
but
even
here
there
are
details
that
will
have
to
be
thrashed
out
edgar
dibbs
in
his
able
pamphlet

the

a
day
and
has
drawn
up
an
ingenious
scheme
for
accelerating
the
motion
of
this
planet
by
four
in
every
hours
so
that
the
alternations
of
light
and
darkness
shall
be
to
the
new
reckoning
i
think
such
would
be
indispensable
though
i
know
there
is
a
formidable
body
of
opinion
against
me
but
i
am
far
from
being
convinced
of
the
feasibility
of
dibbs

the
hour

has
come
to
stay
anomalous
though
it
certainly
will
seem

the
week
the
month
and
the
year
i
should
like
to
have
incorporated
dibbs
scheme
in
my
vision
of
the
dawn
but
as
i
have
said
the
scope
of
this
vision
is
purely
practical

rendered
by

that
the

how
to
secure

these

we
are

the

that
is
the
solution
is
really
very
simple
the

will
be
divided
into
ten
sections
section
a
section
b
and
so
on
to
section
j
and
to
every
section
one
day
of
the
decimal
week
will
be
assigned
as
a
day

those
people
who
fall

those

will
rest

so
on
on
every
day
of

of

population
will
be
resting
but
the
other
will
be
at
work
the
joyous
hum
and
clang
of
labour
will
never
cease
in
the
municipal
workshops
you
figure
the
smokeless
blue
sky
above
london
dotted
all
over
with
airships
in
which
the
tenth
are
themselves
for
the
labour
of
next
week
looking
down
a
little
wistfully
perhaps
at
the
workshops
from
which
they
are
temporarily
banished
and
here
i
scent
a
difficulty
so
attractive
a
thing
will
labour
be
in
the
dawn
that
a
man
will
be
tempted
not
to
knock
off
work
when
his
cessation
day
comes
round
and
will
prefer
to
work
for
no
wage
rather
than
not
at
all
so
that
perhaps
there
will
have
to
be
a
law
making
cessation
day
compulsory
and
the
overseers
will
be
empowered
to
punish
infringement
of
this
law
by
forbidding
the
culprit
to
work
for
ten
days
after
the
first
offence
twenty
after
the
second
and
so
on
but
i
do
suppose
there
will
often
be
need
to
put
this
law
in
motion
the
children
of
the
dawn
remember
will
not
be
the
puny
creatures
that
we
are
they
will
not
say
this
what
i
want
to
do
but
i
by
doing
this
be
a
harming
or
b
benefiting
no
matter
in
how
infinitesimal
a
degree
the
future
of
the
race
sunday
must
go
and
as
i
have
hinted
the
progress
of
mankind
will
be
steady
proportionately
to
its
own
automatism
yet
i
think
there
would
be
no
harm
in
having
one
just
one
day
in
the
year
set
aside
as
a
day
of
universal
rest
a
day
for
the
searching
of
hearts
heaven
i
mean
the
future
forbid
that
i
should
be
by
logic
in
dealing
with
problems
of
flesh
and
blood
the
sociologists
of
the
past
thought
the
grey
matter
of
their
own
brains
they
forgot
that
flesh
is
pink
and
blood
is
red
that
is
why
they
could
not
convert
people
the
and
last
day
of
each
year
shall
be
a
general
cessation
day
it
will
correspond
somewhat
to
our
present
christmas
day
but
with
what
a
difference
it
will
not
be
as
with
us
a
mere
opportunity
for
relatives
to
make
up
the
quarrels
they
have
picked
with
each
other
during
the
past
year
and
to
eat
and
drink
things
that
will
make
them
ill
well
into
next
year
holly
and
mistletoe
there
will
be
in
the
municipal
eating
rooms
but
the
men
and
women
who
sit
down
there
to
general
cessation
will
be
glowing
not
with
a
facile
affection
for
their
kith
and
kin
but
with
communal
anxiety
for
the
welfare
of
the
of
people
they
have
never
met
and
are
never
likely
to
meet
the
great
event
of
the
day
will
be
the
performance
of
the
ceremony
of
way
in
the
dawn
death
will
not
be
the
haphazard
affair
that
it
is
under
the
present
anarchic
conditions
men
will
not
be
stumbling
out
of
the
world
at
odd
moments
and
for
reasons
over
which
they
have
no
control
there
will
always
of
course
be
a
percentage
of
deaths
by
misadventure
but
there
will
be
no
deaths
by
disease
nor
on
the
other
hand
will
people
die
of
old
age
every
child
will
start
life
knowing
that
barring
misadventure
he
has
a
certain
fixed
period
of
life
before
him
so
much
and
no
more
but
not
a
moment
less
it
is
impossible
to
foretell
to
what
average
age
the
children
of
the
dawn
will
retain
the
use
of
all
their
faculties
be
fully
vigorous
mentally
and
physically
we
only
know
they
will
be
strong
at
ages
when
we
have
long
ceased
to
be
any
use
to
the
state
let
us
for
sake
of
argument
say
that
on
the
average
their
facilities
will
have
begun
to
decay
at
the
age
of
ninety
a
trifle
over
by
the
new
reckoning
that
then
will
be
the
period
of
life
fixed
for
all
citizens
every
man
on
fulfilling
that
period
will
avail
himself
of
the
municipal
lethal
chamber
he
will
way
i
thought
at
one
time
that
it
would
be
best
for
every
man
to
way
on
the
actual
day
when
he
reaches
the
but
i
see
now
that
this
would
savour
of
private
enterprise
moreover
it
would
rule
out
that
element
of
sentiment
which
in
relation
to
such
a
thing
as
death
we
must
do
nothing
to
mar
the
children
and
friends
of
a
man
on
the
brink
of
death
would
instinctively
wish
to
gather
round
him
how
could
they
accompany
him
to
the
lethal
chamber
if
it
were
an
ordinary
with
every
moment
of
the
time
mapped
out
for
them
on
general
cessation
day
therefore
the
gates
of
the
lethal
chambers
will
stand
open
for
all
those
who
shall
in
the
course
of
the
past
year
have
reached
the
you
figure
the
wide
streets
filled
all
day
long
with
little
solemn
processions
solemn
and
yet
not
in
the
least
unhappy
you
figure
the
old
man
walking
with
a
firm
step
in
the
midst
of
his
progeny
looking
around
him
with
a
clear
eye
at
this
dear
world
which
is
about
to
lose
him
he
will
not
be
thinking
of
himself
he
will
not
be
wishing
the
way
to
the
lethal
chamber
was
longer
he
will
be
filled
with
joy
at
the
thought
that
he
is
about
to
die
for
the
good
of
the
race
to
way
for
the
beautiful
young
breed
of
men
and
women
who
in
simple
artistic
antiseptic
garments
are
disporting
themselves
so
gladly
on
this
day
of
days
they
pause
to
salute
him
as
he
passes
and
presently
he
sees
radiant
in
the
sunlight
the
pleasant
dome
of
the
lethal
chamber
you
figure
him
at
the
gate
shaking
hands
all
round
and
speaking
perhaps
a
few
words
about
the
future
it
was
enough
the
old
broom
had
lost
its
snap
it
had
swept
clean
the
chambers
of
perkins
soul
swished
away
the
whole
accumulation
of
nasty
little
cobwebs
and
malignant
germs
gone
were
the
mean
doubts
that
had
formed
in
him
the
lethargy
the
cheap
cynicism
perkins
was
himself
again
he
saw
now
how
very
stupid
it
was
of
him
to
have
despaired
just
because
his
own
particular
panacea
was
given
a
chance
that
provisional
government
plan
of
his
had
been
good
but
it
was
only
one
of
an
infinite
number
of
possible
paths
to
the
dawn
he
would
try
others
scores
of
others
he
must
get
right
away
out
of
here
he
must
have
his
car
brought
round
from
the
garage
now
to
a
side
door
but
first
he
sat
down
to
the
and
wrote
quickly
duchess
regret
i
am
called
away
on
urgent
political
business
perkins
he
took
the
morocco
leather
case
out
of
his
pocket
and
enclosed
it
with
the
note
in
a
large
envelope
then
he
pressed
the
electric
button
by
his
bedside
almost
feeling
that
this
was
a
signal
for
the
dawn
to
rise
without
more
ado
some
damnable
errors
about
christmas
that
it
is
human
to
err
is
admitted
by
even
the
most
positive
of
our
thinkers
here
we
have
the
great
difference
between
thought
and
the
thought
of
the
past
if
euclid
were
alive
and
i
dare
say
he
is
he
would
not
say
the
angles
at
the
base
of
an
isosceles
triangle
are
equal
to
one
another
he
would
say
to
me
a
very
frail
and
fallible
being
remember
it
does
somehow
seem
that
these
two
angles
have
a
mysterious
and
awful
equality
to
one
another
the
dislike
of
schoolboys
for
euclid
is
unreasonable
in
many
ways
but
fundamentally
it
is
entirely
reasonable
fundamentally
it
is
the
revolt
from
a
man
who
was
either
fallible
and
therefore
in
pretending
to
infallibility
an
impostor
or
infallible
and
therefore
not
human
now
since
it
is
human
to
err
it
is
always
in
reference
to
those
things
which
arouse
in
us
the
most
human
of
all
our
emotions
i
mean
the
emotion
of
love
that
we
conceive
the
deepest
of
our
errors
suppose
we
met
euclid
on
westminster
bridge
and
he
took
us
aside
and
confessed
to
us
that
whilst
he
regarded
parallelograms
and
rhomboids
with
an
indifference
bordering
on
contempt
for
isosceles
triangles
he
cherished
a
wild
romantic
devotion
suppose
he
asked
us
to
accompany
him
to
the
nearest
and
there
purchased
a
guitar
in
order
that
he
might
worthily
sing
to
us
the
radiant
beauty
and
the
radiant
goodness
of
isosceles
triangles
as
men
we
should
i
hope
respect
his
enthusiasm
and
encourage
his
enthusiasm
and
catch
his
enthusiasm
but
as
seekers
after
truth
we
should
be
compelled
to
regard
with
a
dark
suspicion
and
to
check
with
the
most
anxious
care
every
fact
that
he
told
us
about
isosceles
triangles
for
adoration
involves
a
glorious
obliquity
of
vision
it
involves
more
than
that
we
do
not
say
of
love
that
he
is
we
do
not
say
of
love
that
he
is
myopic
we
do
not
say
of
love
that
he
is
astigmatic
we
say
quite
simply
love
is
blind
we
might
go
further
and
say
love
is
deaf
that
would
be
a
profound
and
obvious
truth
we
might
go
further
still
and
say
love
is
dumb
but
that
would
be
a
profound
and
obvious
lie
for
love
is
always
an
extraordinarily
fluent
talker
love
is
a
filled
with
a
gusty
wind
from
heaven
it
is
always
about
the
thing
that
we
love
most
that
we
talk
most
about
this
thing
therefore
our
errors
are
something
more
than
our
deepest
errors
they
are
our
most
frequent
errors
that
is
why
for
nearly
two
thousand
years
mankind
has
been
more
glaringly
wrong
on
the
subject
of
christmas
than
on
any
other
subject
if
mankind
had
hated
christmas
he
would
have
understood
it
from
the
first
what
would
have
happened
then
it
is
impossible
to
say
for
that
which
is
hated
and
therefore
is
persecuted
and
therefore
grows
brave
lives
on
for
ever
whilst
that
which
is
understood
dies
in
the
moment
of
our
understanding
of
it
dies
as
it
were
in
our
awful
grasp
between
the
horns
of
this
eternal
dilemma
shivers
all
the
mystery
of
the
jolly
visible
world
and
of
that
still
jollier
world
which
is
invisible
and
it
is
because
shaw
and
the
writers
of
his
school
can
not
with
all
their
splendid
sincerity
and
acumen
perceive
that
he
and
they
and
all
of
us
are
impaled
on
those
horns
as
certainly
as
the
sausages
i
ate
for
breakfast
this
morning
had
been
impaled
on
the
it
is
for
this
reason
i
say
that
shaw
and
his
friends
seem
to
me
to
miss
the
basic
principle
that
lies
at
the
root
of
all
things
human
and
divine
by
the
way
not
all
things
that
are
divine
are
human
but
all
things
that
are
human
are
divine
but
to
return
to
christmas
i
select
at
random
two
of
the
more
obvious
fallacies
that
obtain
one
is
that
christmas
should
be
observed
as
a
time
of
jubilation
this
is
i
admit
quite
a
recent
idea
it
never
entered
into
the
tousled
heads
of
the
shepherds
by
night
when
the
light
of
the
angel
of
the
lord
shone
about
them
and
they
arose
and
went
to
do
homage
to
the
child
it
never
entered
into
the
heads
of
the
three
wise
men
they
did
not
bring
their
gifts
as
a
joke
but
as
an
awful
oblation
it
never
entered
into
the
heads
of
the
saints
and
scholars
the
poets
and
painters
of
the
middle
ages
looking
back
across
the
years
they
saw
in
that
dark
and
ungarnished
manger
only
a
shrinking
woman
a
brooding
man
and
a
child
born
to
sorrow
the
philomaths
of
the
eighteenth
century
looking
back
saw
nothing
at
all
it
is
not
the
least
of
the
glories
of
the
victorian
era
that
it
rediscovered
christmas
it
is
not
the
least
of
the
mistakes
of
the
victorian
era
that
it
supposed
christmas
to
be
a
feast
the
splendour
of
the
saying
i
have
piped
unto
you
and
you
have
not
danced
i
have
wept
with
you
and
you
have
not
mourned
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
might
have
been
uttered
with
equal
truth
by
any
man
who
had
ever
piped
or
wept
there
is
in
the
human
race
some
dark
spirit
of
recalcitrance
always
pulling
us
in
the
direction
contrary
to
that
in
which
we
are
reasonably
expected
to
go
at
a
funeral
the
slightest
thing
not
in
the
least
ridiculous
at
any
other
time
will
convulse
us
with
internal
laughter
at
a
wedding
we
hover
mysteriously
on
the
brink
of
tears
so
it
is
with
the
modern
christmas
i
find
myself
in
agreement
with
the
cynics
in
so
far
that
i
admit
that
christmas
as
now
observed
tends
to
create
melancholy
but
the
reason
for
this
lies
solely
in
our
own
misconception
christmas
is
essentially
a
if
the
cynics
will
only
make
up
their
minds
to
treat
it
as
such
even
the
saddest
and
most
atrabilious
of
them
will
acknowledge
that
he
has
had
a
rollicking
day
this
brings
me
to
the
second
fallacy
i
refer
to
the
belief
that
christmas
comes
but
once
a
year
perhaps
it
does
according
to
the
calendar
a
quaint
and
interesting
compilation
but
of
little
or
no
practical
value
to
anybody
it
is
not
the
calendar
but
the
spirit
of
man
that
regulates
the
recurrence
of
feasts
and
fasts
spiritually
christmas
day
recurs
exactly
seven
times
a
week
when
we
have
frankly
acknowledged
this
and
acted
on
this
we
shall
begin
to
realise
the
day
mystical
and
terrific
beauty
for
it
is
only
things
that
reveal
themselves
to
us
in
all
their
wonder
and
their
splendour
a
man
who
happens
one
day
to
be
knocked
down
by
a
merely
utters
a
curse
and
instructs
his
solicitor
but
a
man
who
has
been
knocked
down
by
a
every
day
of
the
year
will
have
begun
to
feel
that
he
is
taking
part
in
an
august
and
ritual
he
will
await
the
diurnal
stroke
of
fate
with
the
same
lowly
and
pious
joy
as
animated
the
hindoos
awaiting
juggernaut
his
bruises
will
be
decorations
worn
with
the
modest
pride
of
the
veteran
he
will
cry
aloud
in
the
words
of
the
late
henley
my
head
is
bloody
but
unbowed
he
will
add
my
ribs
are
broken
but
unbent
i
look
for
the
time
when
we
shall
wish
one
another
a
merry
christmas
every
morning
when
roast
turkey
and
shall
be
the
staple
of
our
daily
dinner
and
the
holly
shall
never
be
taken
down
from
the
walls
and
everyone
will
always
be
kissing
everyone
else
under
the
mistletoe
and
what
is
right
as
regards
christmas
is
right
as
regards
all
other
anniversaries
the
time
will
come
when
we
shall
dance
round
the
maypole
every
morning
before
breakfast
a
meal
at
which
buns
will
be
a
standing
dish
and
shall
make
april
fools
of
one
another
every
day
before
noon
the
profound
significance
of
all
fool
day
the
glorious
lesson
that
we
are
all
fools
is
too
apt
at
present
to
be
lost
nor
is
justice
done
to
the
sublime
symbolism
of
shrove
tuesday
the
day
on
which
all
sins
are
shriven
every
day
pancakes
shall
be
eaten
either
before
or
after
the
they
shall
be
eaten
slowly
and
sacramentally
they
shall
be
fried
over
fires
tended
and
kept
for
ever
bright

he

it

elsewhere
upon
this

only
some
blind
deaf
unthinking
justifies
the

acknowledging

this

quick

followed

shakespeare
and
christmas
that
shakespeare
hated
christmas
hated
it
with
a
venom
utterly
alien
to
the
gentle
heart
in
him
i
take
to
be
a
proposition
that
establishes
itself
automatically
if
there
is
one
thing
in
the
plays
and
sonnets
it
is
shakespeare
unconquerable
loathing
of
christmas
the
professors
deny
it
however
or
deny
that
it
is
proven
with
these
gentlemen
i
will
deal
faithfully
i
will
meet
them
on
their
own
parched
ground
making
them
fertilise
it
by
shedding
there
the
last
drop
of
the
water
that
flows
through
their
veins
if
you
find
in
the
works
of
a
poet
whose
instinct
is
to
write
about
everything
under
the
sun
one
obvious
theme
untouched
or
touched
hardly
at
all
then
it
is
at
least
presumable
that
there
was
some
good
reason
for
that
abstinence
such
a
poet
was
shakespeare
it
was
one
of
the
divine
frailties
of
his
genius
that
he
must
be
ever
flying
off
at
a
tangent
from
his
main
theme
to
unpack
his
heart
in
words
about
some
irrelevance
that
had
come
into
his
head
if
it
could
be
shown
that
he
never
mentioned
christmas
we
should
have
proof
presumptive
that
he
consciously
avoided
doing
so
but
if
the
fact
is
that
he
did
mention
it
now
and
again
but
in
grudging
fashion
without
one
spark
of
illumination
he
the
of
all
things
then
we
have
proof
positive
that
he
detested
it
i
see
dryasdust
thumbing
his
concordance
let
my
memory
save
him
the
trouble
i
will
reel
him
off
the
one
passage
in
which
shakespeare
spoke
of
christmas
in
words
that
rise
to
the
level
of
mediocrity
some
say
that
ever
that
season
comes
wherein
our
saviour
birth
is
celebrated
the
bird
of
dawning
singeth
all
night
long
and
then
they
say
no
spirit
dare
stir
abroad
the
nights
are
wholesome
then
no
planets
strike
no
fairy
takes
nor
witch
hath
power
to
charm
so
hallowed
and
so
gracious
is
the
time
so
says
marcellus
at
elsinore
this
is
the
best
our
shakespeare
can
vamp
up
for
the
birthday
of
the
man
with
whom
he
of
all
men
had
the
most
in
common
and
dryasdust
eternally
unable
to
distinguish
chalk
from
cheese
throws
up
his
hands
in
admiration
of
the
marvellous
poetry
if
dryasdust
had
written
it
it
would
more
than
pass
muster
but
as
coming
from
shakespeare
how
aye
and
the
greatest
praiser
the
world
will
ever
know
and
all
he
can
find
in
his
heart
to
sing
of
christmas
is
a
of
old
women
superstitions
again
and
again
he
has
painted
winter
for
us
as
it
never
has
been
painted
since
never
by
goethe
even
though
goethe
in
more
than
one
of
the
touched
the
hem
of
his
garment
there
was
every
external
reason
why
he
should
sing
as
only
he
could
have
sung
of
christmas
the
queen
set
great
store
by
it
she
and
her
courtiers
celebrated
it
year
by
year
with
unction
and
thus
the
ineradicable
snob
in
shakespeare
had
the
most
potent
of
all
inducements
to
honour
the
feast
with
the
full
power
that
was
in
him
but
he
did
not
because
he
would
not
what
is
the
key
to
the
enigma
for
many
years
i
hunted
it
vainly
the
second
time
that
i
met
carlyle
i
tried
to
enlist
his
sympathy
and
aid
he
sat
pensive
for
a
while
and
then
said
that
it
seemed
to
him
a
i
replied
you
have
always
a
phrase
for
everything
tom
but
always
the
wrong
one
he
covered
his
face
and
presently
peering
at
me
through
his
gnarled
fingers
said
mon
ye
recht
i
discussed
the
problem
with
renan
with
emerson
with
disraeli
also
with
cetewayo
poor
cetewayo
best
and
bravest
of
men
but
intellectually
a
professor
like
the
rest
of
them
it
was
borne
in
on
me
that
if
i
were
to
win
to
the
heart
of
the
mystery
i
must
win
alone
the
solution
when
suddenly
it
dawned
on
me
was
so
that
i
was
ashamed
of
the
ways
i
had
been
following
i
learned
then
and
perhaps
it
is
the
one
lesson
worth
the
learning
of
any
man
that
truth
may
be
approached
only
through
the
logic
of
the
heart
for
the
heart
is
eye
and
ear
and
all
excellent
understanding
abides
there
on
christmas
day
assuredly
anne
hathaway
was
born
in
what
year
she
was
born
i
do
not
know
nor
care
i
take
it
she
was
not
less
than
when
she
married
shakespeare
this
however
is
sheer
conjecture
and
in
no
way
to
our
inquiry
it
is
not
the
year
but
the
day
of
the
year
that
matters
all
we
need
bear
in
mind
is
that
on
christmas
day
that
woman
was
born
into
the
world
if
there
be
any
doubting
thomas
among
my
readers
let
him
not
be
afraid
to
utter
himself
i
am
with
the
possible
exception
of
shakespeare
the
gentlest
man
that
ever
breathed
and
i
do
but
bid
him
study
the
plays
in
the
light
i
have
given
him
the
first
thing
that
will
strike
him
is
that
shakespeare
thoughts
turned
constantly
to
the
birthdays
of
all
his
as
a
lover
thoughts
always
do
turn
to
the
moment
at
which
the
loved
one
first
saw
the
light
there
was
a
star
danced
and
under
that
was
born
beatrice
juliet
was
born
on
lammas
eve
marina
tells
us
she
derived
her
name
from
the
chance
of
her
having
been
born
at
sea
and
so
on
throughout
the
whole
gamut
of
women
in
whom
mary
fitton
was
bodied
forth
to
us
but
mark
how
carefully
shakespeare
says
never
a
word
about
the
birthdays
of
the
various
shrews
and
sluts
in
whom
again
and
again
he
gave
us
his
wife
when
and
were
was
born
queen
constance
the
scold
and
bianca
and
doll
tearsheet
and
greasy
jane
in
the
song
and
all
the
rest
of
them
it
is
of
the
last
importance
that
we
should
know
yet
never
a
hint
is
vouchsafed
us
in
the
text
it
is
clear
that
shakespeare
can
not
bring
himself
to
write
about
anne
birthday
will
not
stain
his
imagination
by
thinking
of
it
that
is
entirely
but
why
should
he
loathe
christmas
day
itself
with
precisely
the
same
loathing
there
is
but
one
answer
and
that
the
two
days
were
one
some
are
so
terrible
that
the
most
hardened
realist
of
us
may
well
shrink
from
laying
them
bare
such
a
was
this
of
shakespeare
think
of
it
the
gentlest
spirit
that
ever
breathed
raging
and
fuming
endlessly
in
spleen
against
the
prettiest
of
festivals
here
is
a
spectacle
so
that
try
as
we
will
we
shall
not
put
it
from
us
and
it
is
well
that
we
should
not
for
in
our
plenary
compassion
we
shall
but
learn
to
love
the
man
the
more
is
very
much
a
man
of
genius
and
i
should
be
sorry
if
this
adumbration
of
his
manner
made
any
one
suppose
that
i
do
not
rate
his
writings
about
shakespeare
higher
than
those
of
all
the
professors
scruts
emily
wrackgarth
stirred
the
christmas
pudding
till
her
right
arm
began
to
ache
but
she
did
not
cease
for
that
she
stirred
on
till
her
right
arm
grew
so
numb
that
it
might
have
been
the
right
arm
of
some
girl
at
the
other
end
of
bursley
and
yet
something
deep
down
in
her
whispered
it
is
right
arm
and
you
can
do
what
you
like
with
it
she
did
what
she
liked
with
it
relentlessly
she
kept
it
moving
till
it
reasserted
itself
as
the
arm
of
emily
wrackgarth
prickling
and
tingling
as
with
needles
in
every
tendon
from
wrist
to
elbow
and
still
emily
wrackgarth
hardened
her
heart
presently
she
saw
the
spoon
no
longer
revolving
but
wavering
aimlessly
in
the
midst
of
the
basin
ridiculous
this
must
be
seen
to
in
the
down
of
dark
hairs
that
connected
her
eyebrows
there
was
a
marked
deepening
of
that
vertical
cleft
which
visible
at
all
times
warned
you
that
here
was
a
young
woman
not
to
be
trifled
with
her
brain
despatched
to
her
hand
a
peremptory
message
which
miscarried
the
spoon
wabbled
as
though
held
by
a
baby
emily
knew
that
she
herself
as
a
baby
had
been
carried
into
this
very
kitchen
to
stir
the
christmas
pudding
year
after
year
as
she
grew
up
she
had
been
allowed
to
stir
it
for
luck
and
those
she
reflected
were
the
only
cookery
lessons
she
ever
got
how
like
mother
wrackgarth
had
died
in
the
past
year
of
a
complication
of
ailments
emily
still
wore
on
her
left
shoulder
that
small
tag
of
crape
which
is
as
far
as
the
five
towns
go
in
the
way
of
mourning
her
father
had
died
in
the
year
previous
to
that
of
a
still
more
curious
and
enthralling
complication
of
ailments
jos
his
son
carried
on
the
wrackgarth
works
and
emily
kept
house
for
jos
she
with
her
own
hand
had
made
this
pudding
but
for
her
this
pudding
would
not
have
been
fantastic
utterly
incredible
and
yet
so
it
was
she
was
she
was
mistress
of
the
house
she
could
make
or
unmake
puddings
at
will
and
yet
she
was
emily
wrackgarth
which
was
absurd

footnote

history

wrackgarth

she
would
not
try
to
explain
to
reconcile
she
abandoned
herself
to
the
exquisite
mysteries
of
existence
and
yet
in
her
abandonment
she
kept
a
sharp
on
herself
trying
fiercely
to
make
head
or
tail
of
her
nature
she
thought
herself
a
fool
but
the
fact
that
she
thought
so
was
for
her
a
proof
of
adult
sapience
odd
she
gave
herself
up
and
yet
it
was
just
by
giving
herself
up
that
she
seemed
to
glimpse
sometimes
her
own
inwardness
and
these
bleak
revelations
saddened
her
but
she
savoured
her
sadness
it
was
the
wine
of
life
to
her
and
for
her
sadness
she
scorned
herself
and
in
her
conscious
scorn
she
recovered
her
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
people
of
southern
england
have
even
yet
realised
how
much
introspection
there
is
going
on
all
the
time
in
the
five
towns
visible
from
the
window
of
the
wrackgarths
parlour
was
that
colossal
statue
of
commerce
which
rears
itself
aloft
at
the
point
where
oodge
lane
is
intersected
by
blackstead
street
commerce
executed
in
glossy
doultonware
by
some
sculptor
or
sculptors
unknown
stands
pointing
her
thumb
over
her
shoulder
towards
the
chimneys
of
far
hanbridge
when
i
tell
you
that
the
circumference
of
that
thumb
is
six
inches
and
the
rest
to
scale
you
will
understand
that
the
statue
is
one
of
the
prime
glories
of
bursley
there
were
times
when
emily
wrackgarth
seemed
to
herself
as
vast
and
as
lustrously
impressive
as
it
there
were
other
times
when
she
seemed
to
herself
as
trivial
and
slavish
as
one
of
those
performing
fleas
she
had
seen
at
the
annual
ladies
evening
fête
organised
by
the
bursley
mutual
burial
club
extremist
she
was
now
stirring
the
pudding
with
her
left
hand
the
ingredients
had
already
been
mingled
indistinguishably
in
that
rich
undulating
mass
of
tawniness
which
proclaims
perfection
but
emily
was
determined
to
give
her
left
hand
not
less
than
her
right
what
she
called
a
doing
emily
was
like
that
at
when
her
brother
came
home
from
the
works
she
was
still
at
it
brought
those
scruts
with
you
she
asked
without
looking
up
that
a
fact
he
said
dipping
his
hand
into
the
sagging
pocket
of
his
coat
it
is
perhaps
necessary
to
explain
what
scruts
are
in
the
daily
output
of
every
potbank
there
are
a
certain
proportion
of
flawed
vessels
these
are
cast
aside
by
the
foreman
with
a
lordly
gesture
and
in
due
course
are
hammered
into
fragments
these
fragments
which
are
put
to
various
uses
are
called
scruts
and
one
of
the
uses
they
are
put
to
is
a
sentimental
one
the
dainty
and
luxurious
southerner
looks
to
find
in
his
christmas
pudding
a
a
gold
thimble
a
or
the
like
to
such
the
five
towns
would
say
fie
a
christmas
pudding
in
the
five
towns
contains
nothing
but
suet
flour
cinnamon
brandy
almonds
raisins
and
two
or
three
scruts
there
is
a
world
of
poetry
beauty
romance
in
scruts
though
you
have
to
have
been
brought
up
on
them
to
appreciate
it
scruts
have
passed
into
the
proverbial
philosophy
of
the
district
him
a
pudden
with
more
scruts
than
raisins
to
is
a
criticism
not
infrequently
heard
it
implies
respect
even
admiration
of
emily
wrackgarth
herself
people
often
said
in
reference
to
her
likeness
to
her
father
her
a
scrut
o
th
owd
basin
jos
had
emptied
out
from
his
pocket
on
to
the
table
a
good
three
dozen
of
scruts
emily
laid
aside
her
spoon
rubbed
the
palms
of
her
hands
on
the
bib
of
her
apron
and
proceeded
to
finger
these
scruts
with
the
air
of
a
connoisseur
rejecting
one
after
another
the
pudding
was
a
small
one
designed
merely
for
herself
and
jos
with
remainder
to
the
girl
so
that
it
could
hardly
accommodate
more
than
two
or
three
scruts
emily
knew
well
that
one
scrut
is
as
good
as
another
yet
she
did
not
want
her
brother
to
feel
that
anything
selected
by
him
would
necessarily
pass
muster
with
her
for
his
benefit
she
ostentatiously
wrinkled
her
nose
by
the
by
said
jos
you
remember
albert
grapp
i
asked
him
to
step
over
from
hanbridge
and
help
eat
our
snack
on
christmas
day
emily
gave
jos
one
of
her
looks
you
asked
that
mr
grapp
no
objection
i
hope
he
not
a
bad
sort
and
he
considered
a
bit
of
a
ladies
man
you
know
she
gathered
up
all
the
scruts
and
let
them
fall
in
a
rattling
shower
on
the
exiguous
pudding
two
or
three
fell
wide
of
the
basin
these
she
added
steady
on
cried
jos
what
that
for
that
for
your
guest
replied
his
sister
and
if
you
think
going
to
palm
me
off
on
to
him
or
on
to
any
other
young
fellow
you
a
fool
jos
wrackgarth
the
young
man
protested
weakly
but
she
cut
him
short
do
think
she
said
i
do
know
what
you
been
after
just
of
late
cracking
up
one
young
sawny
and
then
another
on
the
chance
of
me
marrying
him
i
never
heard
of
such
goings
on
but
here
i
am
and
here
i
stay
as
sure
as
my
name
emily
wrackgarth
jos
wrackgarth
she
was
the
incarnation
of
the
adorably
feminine
she
was
exquisitely
vital
she
exuded
at
every
pore
the
pathos
of
her
young
undirected
force
it
is
difficult
to
write
calmly
about
her
for
her
in
another
age
ships
would
have
been
launched
and
cities
besieged
but
brothers
are
a
race
apart
and
blind
it
is
a
fact
that
jos
would
have
been
glad
to
see
his
sister
settled
preferably
in
one
of
the
other
four
towns
she
took
up
the
spoon
and
stirred
vigorously
the
scruts
grated
and
squeaked
together
around
the
basin
while
the
pudding
feebly
wormed
its
way
up
among
them
ii
albert
grapp
ladies
man
though
he
was
was
humble
of
heart
nobody
knew
this
but
himself
not
one
of
his
fellow
clerks
in
bank
knew
it
the
general
theory
in
hanbridge
was
him
got
a
stiff
opinion
o
hisself
but
this
arose
from
what
was
really
a
sign
of
humility
in
him
he
made
the
most
of
himself
he
had
for
instance
a
way
of
his
own
in
the
matter
of
dressing
he
always
wore
a
voluminous
with
a
pair
of
vicuna
trousers
which
he
placed
every
night
under
his
mattress
thus
preserving
in
perfection
the
crease
down
the
centre
of
each
his
collar
was
of
the
highest
secured
in
front
with
an
aluminium
stud
to
which
was
attached
by
a
patent
loop
a
natty
bow
of
sateen
he
had
two
caps
one
of
blue
serge
the
other
of
shepherd
plaid
these
he
wore
on
alternate
days
he
wore
them
in
a
way
of
his
own
well
back
from
his
forehead
so
as
not
to
hide
his
hair
and
with
the
peak
behind
the
peak
made
a
sort
of
over
the
back
of
his
collar
through
a
fault
of
his
tailor
there
was
a
yawning
gap
between
the
back
of
his
collar
and
the
collar
of
his
coat
whenever
he
shook
his
head
the
peak
of
his
cap
had
the
look
of
a
live
thing
trying
to
investigate
this
abyss
dimly
aware
of
the
effect
albert
grapp
shook
his
head
as
seldom
as
possible
on
wet
days
he
wore
a
mackintosh
this
as
he
did
not
yet
possess
a
he
wore
also
but
with
less
glory
on
cold
days
he
had
hoped
there
might
be
rain
on
christmas
morning
but
there
was
no
rain
like
my
luck
he
said
as
he
came
out
of
his
lodgings
and
turned
his
steps
to
that
corner
of
jubilee
avenue
from
which
the
trams
start
every
since
jos
wrackgarth
had
introduced
him
to
his
sister
at
the
hanbridge
oddfellows
biennial
hop
when
he
danced
two
quadrilles
with
her
he
had
seen
her
but
once
he
had
nodded
to
her
five
towns
fashion
and
she
had
nodded
back
at
him
but
with
a
look
that
seemed
to
say
you
need
nod
next
time
you
see
me
i
can
get
along
well
enough
without
your
nods
a
frightening
girl
and
yet
her
brother
had
since
told
him
she
seemed
a
bit
gone
like
on
him
impossible
he
albert
grapp
make
an
impression
on
the
brilliant
miss
wrackgarth
yet
she
had
sent
him
a
verbal
invite
to
spend
christmas
in
her
own
home
and
the
time
had
come
he
was
on
his
way
incredible
that
he
should
arrive
the
tram
must
surely
overturn
or
be
struck
by
lightning
and
yet
no
he
arrived
safely
the
small
servant
who
opened
the
door
gave
him
another
verbal
message
from
miss
wrackgarth
it
was
that
he
must
wipe
his
feet
well
on
the
mat
in
obeying
this
order
he
experienced
a
thrill
of
satisfaction
he
could
not
account
for
he
must
have
stood
shuffling
his
boots
vigorously
for
a
full
minute
this
he
told
himself
was
life
he
albert
grapp
was
alive
and
the
world
was
full
of
other
men
all
alive
and
yet
because
they
were
not
doing
miss
wrackgarth
bidding
none
of
them
really
lived
he
was
filled
with
a
vague
melancholy
but
his
melancholy
pleased
him
in
the
parlour
he
found
jos
awaiting
him
the
table
was
laid
for
three
so
you
here
are
you
said
the
host
using
the
five
towns
formula
emily
in
the
kitchen
he
added
happen
she
be
here
directly
i
hope
she
asked
albert
she
is
said
jos
but
do
you
go
saying
that
to
her
she
care
about
society
airs
and
graces
you
make
no
headway
if
you
are
blunt
oh
right
you
are
said
albert
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
knew
his
way
about
a
moment
later
emily
joined
them
still
wearing
her
kitchen
apron
so
you
here
are
you
she
said
but
did
not
shake
hands
the
servant
had
followed
her
in
with
the
tray
and
the
next
few
seconds
were
occupied
in
the
disposal
of
the
beef
and
trimmings
the
meal
began
emily
carving
the
main
thought
of
a
man
less
infatuated
than
albert
grapp
would
have
been
this
girl
ca
cook
and
she
never
learn
to
the
beef
instead
of
being
red
and
brown
was
pink
and
white
uneatable
beef
and
yet
he
relished
it
more
than
anything
he
had
ever
tasted
this
beef
was
her
own
handiwork
thus
it
was
because
she
had
made
it
so
he
warily
refrained
from
complimenting
her
but
the
idea
of
a
second
helping
obsessed
him
happen
i
could
do
with
a
bit
more
like
he
said
emily
hacked
off
the
bit
more
and
jerked
it
on
to
the
plate
he
had
held
out
to
her
thanks
he
said
and
then
as
emily
lip
curled
and
jos
gave
him
a
warning
kick
under
the
table
he
tried
to
look
as
if
he
had
said
nothing
only
when
the
second
course
came
on
did
he
suspect
that
the
meal
was
a
calculated
protest
against
his
presence
this
a
christmas
pudding
the
litter
of
fractured
earthenware
was
hardly
held
together
by
the
suet
and
raisins
all
his
pride
of
manhood
and
there
was
plenty
of
pride
mixed
up
with
albert
grapp
humility
dictated
a
refusal
to
touch
that
pudding
yet
he
soon
found
himself
touching
it
though
gingerly
with
his
spoon
and
fork
in
the
matter
of
dealing
with
scruts
there
are
two
schools
the
old
and
the
new
the
old
school
pushes
its
head
well
over
its
plate
and
drops
the
scrut
straight
from
its
mouth
the
new
school
emits
the
scrut
into
the
fingers
of
its
left
hand
and
therewith
deposits
it
on
the
rim
of
the
plate
albert
noticed
that
emily
was
of
the
new
school
but
might
she
not
despise
as
affectation
in
him
what
came
natural
to
herself
on
the
other
hand
if
he
showed
himself
as
a
prop
of
the
old
school
might
she
not
set
her
face
the
more
stringently
against
him
the
chances
were
that
whichever
course
he
took
would
be
the
wrong
one
it
was
then
that
he
had
an
inspiration
an
idea
of
the
sort
that
comes
to
a
man
once
in
his
life
and
finds
him
likely
as
not
unable
to
put
it
into
practice
albert
was
not
sure
he
could
consummate
this
idea
of
his
he
had
indisputably
fine
teeth
a
proper
mouthful
of
grinders
in
local
phrase
but
would
they
stand
the
strain
he
was
going
to
impose
on
them
he
could
but
try
them
without
a
sign
of
nervousness
he
raised
his
spoon
with
one
scrut
in
it
to
his
mouth
this
scrut
he
put
between
two
of
his
molars
bit
hard
on
it
and
eternity
of
that
moment
felt
it
and
heard
it
snap
in
two
emily
also
heard
it
he
was
conscious
that
at
sound
of
the
percussion
she
started
forward
and
stared
at
him
but
he
did
not
look
at
her
calmly
systematically
with
gradually
diminishing
crackles
he
reduced
that
scrut
to
powder
and
washed
the
powder
down
with
a
sip
of
beer
while
he
dealt
with
the
second
scrut
he
talked
to
jos
about
the
borough
council
proposal
to
erect
an
electric
on
the
site
of
the
old
down
hillport
way
he
was
aware
of
a
slight
abrasion
inside
his
left
cheek
no
matter
he
must
be
more
careful
there
were
six
scruts
still
to
be
negotiated
he
knew
that
what
he
was
doing
was
a
thing
grandiose
unique
epical
a
thing
a
thing
that
would
outlive
marble
and
the
gilded
monuments
of
princes
yet
he
kept
his
head
he
did
not
hurry
nor
did
he
dawdle
scrut
by
scrut
he
ground
slowly
but
he
ground
exceeding
small
and
while
he
did
so
he
talked
wisely
and
well
he
passed
from
the
to
a
first
edition
of
leconte
de
lisle
parnasse
contemporain
that
he
had
picked
up
for
sixpence
in
liverpool
and
thence
to
the
proposal
to
drive
a
tunnel
under
the
knype
canal
so
as
to
link
up
the
with
the
critchworth
and
suddleford
jos
was
too
amazed
to
put
in
a
word
jos
sat
merely
gaping
a
gape
that
merged
by
imperceptible
degrees
into
a
grin
presently
he
ceased
to
watch
his
guest
he
sat
watching
his
sister
not
once
did
albert
himself
glance
in
her
direction
she
was
just
a
dim
silhouette
on
the
outskirts
of
his
vision
but
there
she
was
unmoving
and
he
could
feel
the
fixture
of
her
unseen
eyes
the
time
was
at
hand
when
he
would
have
to
meet
those
eyes
would
he
flinch
was
he
master
of
himself
the
last
scrut
was
powder
no
temporising
he
jerked
his
glass
to
his
mouth
a
moment
later
holding
out
his
plate
to
her
he
looked
emily
full
in
the
eyes
they
were
emily
eyes
but
not
hers
alone
they
were
collective
eyes
that
was
it
they
were
the
eyes
of
stark
staring
womanhood
her
face
had
been
dead
white
but
now
suddenly
up
from
her
throat
over
her
cheeks
through
the
down
between
her
eyebrows
went
a
rush
of
colour
up
over
her
temples
through
the
very
parting
of
her
hair
happen
he
said
without
a
quaver
in
his
voice
i
have
a
bit
more
like
she
flung
her
arms
forward
on
the
table
and
buried
her
face
in
them
it
was
a
gesture
wild
and
meek
it
was
the
gesture
foreseen
and
yet
incredible
it
was
recondite
inexplicable
and
yet
obvious
it
was
the
only
thing
to
be
done
and
yet
by
gum
she
had
done
it
her
brother
had
risen
from
his
seat
and
was
now
at
the
door
think
i
step
round
to
the
works
he
said
and
see
if
they
banked
up
that
furnace
aright
author
has
in
preparation
a
series
of
volumes
dealing
with
the
life
of
albert
and
emily
endeavour
the
dawn
of
christmas
day
found
london
laid
out
in
a
shroud
of
snow
like
a
body
wasted
by
diseases
that
had
triumphed
over
it
at
last
london
lay
stark
and
still
now
beneath
a
sky
that
was
as
the
closed
leaden
shell
of
a
coffin
it
was
what
is
called
an
christmas
nothing
seemed
to
be
moving
except
the
thames
whose
embanked
waters
flowed
on
sullenly
in
their
eternal
act
of
escape
to
the
sea
all
along
the
wan
stretch
of
cheyne
walk
the
thin
trees
stood
exanimate
with
not
a
breath
of
wind
to
stir
the
snow
that
pied
their
branches
here
and
there
on
the
muffled
ground
lay
a
sparrow
that
had
been
frozen
in
the
night
its
little
claws
sticking
up
heavenward
but
here
and
there
also
those
tinier
adventurers
of
the
london
air
smuts
floated
vaguely
and
came
to
rest
on
the
snow
signs
that
in
the
seeming
death
of
civilisation
some
housemaids
at
least
survived
and
some
fires
had
been
lit
one
of
these
fires
crackling
in
the
grate
of
one
of
those
which
look
fondly
out
on
the
river
and
tolerantly
across
to
battersea
was
being
watched
by
the
critical
eye
of
an
aged
canary
the
cage
in
which
this
bird
sat
was
hung
in
the
middle
of
the
it
contained
three
perches
and
also
a
pendent
hoop
the
tray
that
was
its
floor
had
just
been
cleaned
and
sanded
in
the
embrasure
to
the
right
was
a
fresh
supply
of
in
the
embrasure
to
the
left
the
had
just
been
refilled
with
clear
water
stuck
between
the
bars
was
a
large
sprig
of
groundsel
yet
though
all
was
thus
in
order
the
bird
did
not
eat
nor
drink
nor
did
he
bathe
with
his
back
to
battersea
and
his
head
sunk
deep
between
his
little
sloping
shoulders
he
watched
the
fire
the
windows
had
for
a
while
been
opened
as
usual
to
air
the
room
for
him
and
the
fire
had
not
yet
mitigated
the
chill
it
was
not
his
custom
to
bathe
at
so
inclement
an
hour
and
his
appetite
for
food
and
drink
less
keen
than
it
had
once
been
required
to
be
whetted
by
example
he
never
broke
his
fast
before
his
master
and
mistress
broke
theirs
time
had
been
when
for
sheer
joy
in
life
he
fluttered
from
perch
to
perch
though
there
were
none
to
watch
him
and
even
sang
roulades
though
there
were
none
to
hear
he
would
not
do
these
things
nowadays
save
at
the
fond
instigation
of
and
adrian
berridge
the
housemaid
who
ministered
to
his
cage
the
parlourmaid
who
laid
the
breakfast
table
sometimes
tried
to
incite
him
to
perform
for
their
own
pleasure
but
the
sense
of
caste
strong
in
his
protuberant
little
bosom
steeled
him
against
these
advances
while
the
was
being
laid
he
heard
a
faint
tap
against
the
turning
round
he
perceived
on
the
sill
a
creature
like
to
himself
but
very
different
a
creature
who
despite
the
pretensions
of
a
red
waistcoat
in
the
worst
possible
taste
belonged
evidently
to
the
ranks
of
the
outcast
and
the
disinherited
in
previous
winters
the
sill
had
been
strewn
every
morning
with
this
winter
no
had
been
vouchsafed
and
the
canary
though
he
did
not
exactly
understand
why
this
was
so
was
glad
that
so
it
was
he
had
felt
that
his
poor
relations
took
advantage
of
the
berridges
kindness
two
or
three
of
them
as
pensioners
might
not
have
been
amiss
but
they
came
in
swarms
and
they
gobbled
their
food
in
a
disgusting
fashion
not
trifling
coquettishly
with
it
as
birds
should
the
reason
for
this
the
canary
knew
was
that
they
were
hungry
and
of
that
he
was
sorry
he
hated
to
think
how
much
destitution
there
was
in
the
world
and
he
could
not
help
thinking
about
it
when
samples
of
it
were
thrust
under
his
notice
that
was
the
principal
reason
why
he
was
glad
that
the
was
strewn
no
more
and
seldom
visited
he
would
much
rather
not
have
seen
this
solitary
applicant
the
two
eyes
fixed
on
his
made
him
feel
very
uncomfortable
and
yet
for
fear
of
seeming
to
be
outfaced
he
did
not
like
to
look
away
the
subdued
clangour
of
the
gong
sounded
for
breakfast
gave
him
an
excuse
for
turning
suddenly
round
and
watching
the
door
of
the
room
a
few
moments
later
there
came
to
him
a
faint
odour
of
harris
tweed
followed
immediately
by
the
short
somewhat
stout
figure
of
his
master
a
man
whose
mild
fresh
pink
round
face
seemed
to
find
salvation
as
it
were
at
the
last
moment
in
a
auburn
beard
adrian
berridge
paused
on
the
threshold
as
was
his
wont
with
closed
eyes
and
dilated
nostrils
enjoying
the
aroma
of
complex
freshness
which
the
had
at
this
hour
pathetically
a
creature
of
habit
he
liked
to
savour
the
various
scents
sweet
or
acrid
that
went
to
symbolise
for
him
the
time
and
the
place
here
were
the
immediate
scents
of
dry
toast
of
china
tea
of
napery
fresh
from
the
wash
together
with
that
vague
scent
which
boiled
eggs
give
out
through
their
unbroken
shells
and
as
a
permanent
base
to
these
there
was
the
scent
of
chippendale
and
of
parquet
and
of
persian
rugs
moreover
crowning
the
composition
there
was
the
delicate
pungency
of
the
holly
that
topped
the
queen
anne
mirror
and
the
mantegna
prints
coming
forward
into
the
room
berridge
greeted
the
canary
well
amber
old
fellow
he
said
a
happy
christmas
to
you
affectionately
he
pushed
the
tip
of
a
plump
white
finger
between
the
bars
tweet
he
added
tweet
answered
the
bird
hopping
to
and
fro
along
his
perch
quite
an
christmas
amber
said
berridge
turning
to
scan
the
weather
at
sight
of
the
robin
a
little
spasm
of
pain
contracted
his
face
a
shine
of
tears
came
to
his
prominent
pale
eyes
and
he
turned
quickly
away
just
at
that
moment
heralded
by
a
slight
fragrance
of
old
lace
and
of
that
peculiar
almost
unseizable
odour
that
uncut
turquoises
have
berridge
appeared
what
is
the
matter
adrian
she
asked
quickly
she
glanced
sideways
into
the
queen
anne
mirror
her
hand
fluttering
like
a
pale
moth
to
her
hair
which
she
always
wore
braided
in
a
fashion
she
had
derived
from
pollaiuolo
ursula
nothing
jacynth
nothing
he
answered
with
a
lightness
that
carried
no
conviction
and
he
made
behind
his
back
a
gesture
to
frighten
away
the
robin
amber
is
unwell
is
he
she
came
quickly
to
the
cage
amber
executed
for
her
a
roulade
of
great
sweetness
his
voice
had
not
perhaps
the
fullness
for
which
it
had
been
noted
in
earlier
years
but
the
art
with
which
he
managed
it
was
as
exquisite
as
ever
it
was
clear
to
his
audience
that
the
veteran
artist
was
hale
and
hearty
but
jacynth
relieved
on
one
point
had
a
misgiving
on
another
this
groundsel
does
look
very
fresh
does
it
she
murmured
withdrawing
the
sprig
from
the
bars
she
rang
the
bell
and
when
the
servant
came
in
answer
to
it
said
oh
jenny
will
you
please
bring
up
another
piece
of
groundsel
for
master
amber
i
do
think
this
one
is
quite
fresh
this
formal
way
of
naming
the
canary
to
the
servants
always
jarred
on
her
principles
and
on
those
of
her
husband
they
tried
to
regard
their
servants
as
essentially
equals
of
themselves
and
lately
had
given
jenny
strict
orders
to
leave
off
calling
them
sir
and
and
to
call
them
simply
adrian
and
jacynth
but
jenny
after
one
or
two
efforts
that
ended
in
faint
giggles
had
reverted
to
the
crude
old
nomenclature
as
much
to
the
relief
as
to
the
mortification
of
the
berridges
they
did
it
is
true
discuss
the
possibility
of
redressing
the
balance
by
calling
the
parlourmaid
miss
but
when
it
came
to
the
point
their
lips
refused
this
office
and
conversely
their
lips
persisted
in
the
social
prefix
to
the
bird
name
somehow
that
anomaly
seemed
to
them
symbolic
of
their
lives
both
of
them
yearned
so
wistfully
to
live
always
in
accordance
to
the
nature
of
things
and
this
they
felt
ought
surely
to
be
the
line
of
least
resistance
in
the
immense
difficulties
it
presented
and
in
their
constant
failures
to
surmount
these
difficulties
they
often
wondered
whether
the
nature
of
things
might
not
be
after
all
something
other
than
what
they
thought
it
again
and
again
it
seemed
to
be
in
as
direct
conflict
with
duty
as
with
inclination
so
that
they
were
driven
to
wonder
also
whether
what
they
conceived
to
be
duty
were
not
also
a
mirage
a
leading
them
on
to
disaster
the
fresh
groundsel
was
brought
in
while
jacynth
was
pouring
out
the
tea
she
rose
and
took
it
to
the
cage
and
it
was
then
that
she
too
saw
the
robin
still
fluttering
on
the
sill
with
a
quick
instinct
she
knew
that
adrian
had
seen
it
knew
what
had
brought
that
look
to
his
face
she
went
and
bending
over
him
laid
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
the
disturbance
of
her
touch
caused
the
tweed
to
give
out
a
tremendous
volume
of
scent
making
her
feel
a
little
dizzy
adrian
she
faltered
might
we
for
once
it
is
christmas
day
might
we
just
sprinkle
some
he
rose
from
the
table
and
leaned
against
the
mantelpiece
looking
down
at
the
fire
she
watched
him
tensely
at
length
oh
jacynth
he
groaned
do
do
tempt
me
but
surely
dear
surely
jacynth
do
you
remember
that
long
talk
we
had
last
winter
after
the
annual
meeting
of
the
feathered
friends
league
and
how
we
agreed
that
those
sporadic
doles
could
do
no
real
good
must
even
degrade
the
birds
who
received
them
and
that
we
had
no
right
to
meddle
in
what
ought
to
be
done
by
collective
action
of
the
state
yes
and
oh
my
dear
i
do
still
agree
with
all
my
heart
but
if
the
state
will
do
nothing
nothing
it
wo
it
dare
go
on
doing
nothing
unless
we
encourage
it
to
do
so
do
you
see
jacynth
it
is
just
because
so
many
people
take
it
on
themselves
to
feed
a
few
birds
here
and
there
that
the
state
feels
it
can
afford
to
shirk
the
responsibility
all
that
is
fearfully
true
but
just
now
adrian
the
look
in
that
robin
eyes
berridge
covered
his
own
eyes
as
though
to
blot
out
from
his
mind
the
memory
of
that
look
but
jacynth
was
not
silenced
she
felt
herself
dragged
on
by
her
sense
of
duty
to
savour
and
to
make
her
husband
savour
the
full
bitterness
that
the
situation
could
yield
for
them
both
adrian
she
said
a
fearful
thought
came
to
me
suppose
suppose
it
had
been
amber
even
before
he
shuddered
at
the
thought
he
raised
his
finger
to
his
lips
glancing
round
at
the
cage
it
was
clear
that
amber
had
not
overheard
jacynth
remark
for
he
threw
back
his
head
and
uttered
one
of
his
blithest
trills
adrian
thus
relieved
was
free
to
shudder
at
the
thought
just
suggested
sometimes
murmured
jacynth
i
wonder
if
we
holding
the
views
we
hold
are
justified
in
keeping
amber
ah
dear
we
took
him
in
our
individualistic
days
we
can
not
repudiate
him
now
it
would
be
fair
besides
you
see
he
here
on
a
basis
of
mere
charity
he
not
a
parasite
but
an
artist
he
gives
us
of
his
art
yes
dear
i
know
but
you
remember
our
doubts
about
the
position
of
artists
in
the
community
whether
the
state
ought
to
sanction
them
at
all
true
but
we
can
not
visit
those
doubts
on
our
old
friend
yonder
can
we
dear
at
the
same
time
i
admit
that
when
when
jacynth
if
ever
anything
happens
to
amber
we
shall
perhaps
not
be
justified
in
keeping
another
bird
do
please
do
talk
of
such
things
she
moved
to
the
window
snow
a
delicate
white
powder
was
falling
on
the
coverlet
of
snow
outside
on
the
sill
the
importunate
robin
lay
supine
his
little
heart
beating
no
more
behind
the
shabby
finery
of
his
breast
but
his
glazing
eyes
as
though
even
in
death
he
were
still
questioning
above
him
and
all
around
him
brooded
the
genius
of
infinity
dispassionate
inscrutable
grey
jacynth
turned
and
mutely
beckoned
her
husband
to
the
window
they
stood
there
these
two
gazing
silently
down
presently
jacynth
said
adrian
are
you
sure
that
we
you
and
i
for
all
our
theories
and
all
our
efforts
are
futile
no
dear
sometimes
i
am
not
sure
but
there
a
certain
comfort
in
not
being
sure
to
die
for
what
one
knows
to
be
true
as
many
saints
have
done
that
is
well
but
to
live
as
many
of
us
do
nowadays
in
service
of
what
may
for
aught
we
know
be
only
a
or
not
true
at
all
this
seems
to
me
nobler
still
because
it
takes
more
out
of
us
because
it
takes
more
out
of
us
standing
between
the
live
bird
and
the
dead
they
gazed
across
the
river
over
the
wharves
over
the
dim
slender
chimneys
from
which
no
smoke
came
into
the
veil
of
the
distance
and
it
seemed
to
them
that
the
genius
of
infinity
did
not
know
perhaps
did
not
even
care
whether
they
were
futile
or
not
nor
how
much
and
to
what
purpose
if
to
any
purpose
they
must
go
on
striving
christmas
one
likes
it
or
not
this
said
there
is
plaguey
little
else
to
say
of
christmas
and
i
though
i
doubt
my
sentiments
touch
you
not
at
all
would
rather
leave
that
little
unsaid
did
i
confess
a
distaste
for
christmas
i
should
incur
your
enmity
but
if
i
find
it
as
i
protest
i
do
rather
agreeable
than
otherwise
why
should
i
spoil
my
pleasure
by
stringing
vain
words
about
it
swift
and
the
broomstick
yes
but
that
essay
was
done
at
the
behest
of
a
clever
woman
and
to
annoy
the
admirers
of
robert
boyle
besides
it
was
hardly
or
do
you
think
it
was
worth
the
trouble
of
doing
it
there
was
no
trouble
involved
possibly
but
i
am
not
the
dean
and
anyhow
the
fact
that
he
never
did
anything
of
the
kind
again
may
be
taken
to
imply
that
he
would
not
be
bothered
so
would
not
i
if
i
had
a
deanery
that
is
an
hypothesis
i
am
tempted
to
pursue
i
should
like
to
fill
my
allotted
space
before
reaching
the
tiresome
theme
i
have
set
myself
a
deanery
the
cawing
of
rooks
their
effect
on
the
nervous
system
trollope
delineations
of
deans
the
advantages
of
the
novel
but
your
discursive
essayist
is
a
nuisance
best
come
to
the
point
the
bore
is
in
finding
a
point
to
come
to
besides
the
chances
are
that
any
such
point
will
have
long
ago
been
worn
blunt
by
a
score
of
more
active
seekers
alas
since
i
wrote
the
foregoing
words
i
have
been
out
for
a
long
walk
in
search
of
inspiration
through
the
streets
of
what
is
called
the
west
end
snobbishly
so
called
why
draw
these
crude
distinctions
we
all
know
that
mayfair
happens
to
lie
a
few
miles
further
west
than
whitechapel
it
argues
a
lack
of
breeding
to
go
on
calling
attention
to
the
fact
if
the
people
of
whitechapel
were
less
beautiful
or
less
or
more
ignorant
than
we
there
might
be
some
excuse
but
they
are
not
so
true
themselves
talk
about
the
east
end
but
this
only
makes
the
matter
worse
to
a
sensitive
ear
their
phrase
has
a
ring
of
ironic
humility
that
jars
not
less
than
our
own
coarse
boastfulness
heaven
knows
they
have
a
right
to
be
ironic
and
who
shall
blame
them
for
exercising
it
all
the
same
this
sort
of
thing
worries
me
horribly
i
said
that
i
found
christmas
rather
agreeable
than
otherwise
but
i
was
speaking
as
one
accustomed
to
live
mostly
in
the
past
the
walk
i
have
just
taken
refreshing
in
itself
has
painfully
reminded
me
that
i
can
not
hit
it
off
with
the
present
my
life
is
in
the
later
days
of
the
eighteenth
and
the
earlier
days
of
the
nineteenth
century
this
twentieth
affair
is
as
a
vision
dimly
foreseen
at
odd
moments
and
put
from
me
with
a
slight
shudder
my
actual
christmases
are
spent
say
in
holland
house
which
has
but
recently
been
built
little
charles
fox
is
allowed
by
his
father
to
join
us
for
the
earlier
stages
of
dessert
i
am
conscious
of
patting
him
on
the
head
and
predicting
for
him
a
distinguished
future
a
very
bright
little
fellow
with
his
father
eyes
or
again
i
am
down
at
newstead
byron
is
in
his
wildest
spirits
a
shade
too
uproarious
i
am
glad
to
escape
into
the
park
and
stroll
a
quiet
hour
on
the
arm
of
hughes
ball
years
pass
the
approach
of
christmas
finds
one
loth
to
leave
one
usual
haunts
one
is
on
one
way
to
one
club
to
dine
with
postumus
and
dear
old
wigsby
pendennis
quietly
at
one
consecrated
table
near
the
fireplace
as
one
is
crossing
james
street
an
grunt
causes
one
to
reel
back
just
in
time
to
be
not
run
over
by
a
inside
is
a
woman
who
scowls
down
at
one
through
the
window
serve
you
right
if
we
gone
over
you
yes
i
often
have
these
awakenings
to
fact
or
rather
these
provisions
of
what
life
might
be
if
i
survived
into
the
twentieth
century
alas
i
have
mentioned
that
woman
in
the
because
she
is
germane
to
my
theme
she
typifies
the
vices
of
the
modern
christmas
for
her
by
the
absurd
accident
of
her
wealth
there
is
no
distinction
between
people
who
have
not
and
people
who
might
as
well
be
run
over
but
i
wrong
her
if
we
others
were
all
run
over
there
would
be
no
one
before
whom
she
could
flaunt
her
loathsome
air
of
superiority
and
what
would
she
do
then
poor
thing
i
doubt
she
would
die
of
boredom
painfully
one
hopes
in
the
same
way
if
the
in
bond
street
knew
there
was
no
one
who
could
not
afford
to
buy
the
things
in
their
windows
there
would
be
an
end
to
the
display
that
makes
those
windows
intolerable
to
you
and
me
during
the
month
of
december
i
had
often
suspected
that
the
things
there
were
not
meant
to
be
bought
by
people
who
could
buy
them
but
merely
to
irritate
the
rest
this
afternoon
i
was
sure
of
it
not
in
one
window
anything
a
sane
person
would
give
to
any
one
not
an
idiot
but
everywhere
a
general
glossy
grin
out
at
people
who
are
not
plutocrats
this
sort
of
thing
lashes
me
to
ungovernable
fury
the
lion
is
roused
and
i
recognise
in
myself
a
born
leader
of
men
be
so
good
as
to
smash
those
windows
for
me
one
does
not
like
to
think
that
christmas
has
been
snapped
up
docked
of
its
kindliness
and
pressed
into
the
service
of
an
odious
ostentation
but
so
it
has
alas
the
thought
of
father
christmas
trudging
through
the
snow
to
the
homes
of
gentle
and
simple
alike
forgive
that
stupid
snobbish
phrase
was
agreeable
but
father
christmas
in
red
plush
breeches
lounging
on
the
doorstep
of
sir
gorgius
midas
one
averts
one
eyes
i
have
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
another
objection
to
the
modern
christmas
it
would
be
affectation
to
pretend
not
to
know
that
there
are
many
jews
living
in
england
and
in
london
especially
i
have
always
had
a
deep
respect
for
that
race
their
distinction
in
intellect
and
in
character
being
not
one
of
them
i
may
in
their
behalf
put
a
point
which
themselves
would
be
the
last
to
suggest
i
hope
they
will
acquit
me
of
impertinence
in
doing
this
you
in
your
turn
must
acquit
me
of
sentimentalism
the
jews
are
a
minority
and
as
such
must
take
their
chances
but
may
not
a
majority
refrain
from
pressing
its
rights
to
the
utmost
it
is
well
that
we
should
celebrate
christmas
heartily
and
all
that
but
we
could
do
so
without
an
emphasis
that
seems
to
me
in
the
circumstances
side
good
taste
good
taste
is
a
hateful
phrase
but
it
escaped
me
in
the
heat
of
the
moment
alas
the
feast
the
hut
in
which
slept
the
white
man
was
on
a
clearing
between
the
forest
and
the
river
silence
the
silence
murmurous
and
unquiet
of
a
tropical
night
brooded
over
the
hut
that
baked
through
by
the
sun
sweated
a
vapour
beneath
the
cynical
light
of
the
stars
mahamo
lay
rigid
and
watchful
at
the
hut
mouth
in
his
upturned
eyes
and
along
the
polished
surface
of
his
lean
body
black
and
immobile
the
stars
were
reflected
creating
an
illusion
of
themselves
who
are
illusions
the
roofs
of
the
congested
trees
writhing
in
some
kind
of
agony
private
and
eternal
made
tenebrous
and
shifty
silhouettes
against
the
sky
like
shapes
cut
out
of
black
paper
by
a
maniac
who
pushes
them
with
his
thumb
this
way
and
that
irritably
on
a
concave
surface
of
blue
steel
resin
oozed
unseen
from
the
upper
branches
to
the
trunks
swathed
in
creepers
that
clutched
and
interlocked
with
tendrils
venomous
frantic
and
faint
down
below
by
force
of
habit
the
lush
herbage
went
through
the
farce
of
growth
that
farce
old
and
screaming
whose
trite
end
is
decomposition
within
the
hut
the
form
of
the
white
man
corpulent
and
pale
was
covered
with
a
that
was
itself
illusory
like
everything
else
only
more
so
flying
squadrons
of
mosquitoes
inside
its
meshes
flickered
and
darted
over
him
working
hard
but
keeping
silence
so
as
not
to
excite
him
from
sleep
cohorts
of
yellow
ants
disputed
him
against
cohorts
of
purple
ants
the
two
kinds
slaying
one
another
in
thousands
the
battle
was
undecided
when
suddenly
with
no
such
warning
as
it
gives
in
some
parts
of
the
world
the
sun
blazed
up
over
the
horizon
turning
night
into
day
and
the
insects
vanished
back
into
their
camps
the
white
man
ground
his
knuckles
into
the
corners
of
his
eyes
emitting
that
snore
final
and
querulous
of
a
man
awakened
rudely
with
a
gesture
brusque
but
flaccid
he
plucked
aside
the
net
and
peered
around
the
bales
of
cotton
cloth
the
beads
the
brass
wire
the
bottles
of
rum
had
not
been
spirited
away
in
the
night
so
far
so
good
the
faithful
servant
of
his
employers
was
now
at
liberty
to
care
for
his
own
interests
he
regarded
himself
passing
his
hands
over
his
skin
hi
mahamo
he
shouted
i
been
eaten
up
the
islander
with
one
sinuous
motion
sprang
from
the
ground
through
the
mouth
of
the
hut
then
after
a
glance
he
threw
high
his
hands
in
thanks
to
such
good
and
evil
spirits
as
had
charge
of
his
concerns
in
a
tone
half
of
reproach
half
of
apology
he
murmured
you
white
men
sometimes
say
strange
things
that
deceive
the
heart
reach
me
that
ammonia
bottle
hear
answered
the
white
man
this
is
a
pretty
place
you
brought
me
to
he
took
a
draught
christmas
day
too
of
all
the
but
i
suppose
it
seems
all
right
to
you
you
funny
blackamoor
to
be
here
on
christmas
day
we
are
here
on
the
day
appointed
williams
it
is
a
of
your
people
williams
had
lain
back
with
closed
eyes
on
his
mat
nostalgia
was
doing
duty
to
him
for
imagination
he
was
wafted
to
a
bedroom
in
marylebone
where
in
honour
of
the
day
he
lay
late
dozing
with
great
contentment
outside
a
slush
of
snow
in
the
street
the
sound
of
from
below
a
savour
of
especial
cookery
yes
he
said
it
a
of
my
people
of
mine
also
said
the
islander
humbly
is
it
though
but
they
do
business
first
they
must
first
do
that
and
they
bring
their
ivory
with
them
every
man
will
bring
ivory
answered
the
islander
with
a
smile
gleaming
and
wide
how
soon
they
be
here
has
not
the
sun
risen
they
are
on
their
way
well
i
hope
they
hurry
the
sooner
we
off
this
cursed
island
of
yours
the
better
take
all
those
things
out
williams
added
pointing
to
the
merchandise
and
arrange
them
neatly
mind
you
in
certain
circumstances
it
is
right
that
a
man
be
humoured
in
trifles
mahamo
having
borne
out
the
merchandise
arranged
it
very
neatly
while
williams
made
his
toilet
the
sun
and
the
forest
careless
of
the
doings
of
white
and
black
men
alike
waged
their
warfare
implacable
and
daily
the
forest
from
its
inmost
depths
sent
forth
perpetually
its
legions
of
shadows
that
fell
dead
in
the
instant
of
exposure
to
the
enemy
whose
rays
heroic
and
absurd
its
outposts
annihilated
there
came
from
those
inilluminable
depths
the
equable
rumour
of
myriads
of
winged
things
and
crawling
things
newly
roused
to
the
task
of
killing
and
being
killed
thence
detached
itself
little
by
little
an
insidious
sound
of
a
drum
beaten
this
sound
drew
more
near
williams
issuing
from
the
hut
heard
it
and
stood
gaping
towards
it
is
that
them
he
asked
that
is
they
the
islander
murmured
moving
away
towards
the
edge
of
the
forest
sounds
of
chanting
were
a
now
audible
accompaniment
to
the
drum
what
that
they
singing
asked
williams
they
sing
of
their
business
said
mahamo
oh
williams
was
slightly
shocked
i
have
thought
they
be
singing
of
their
feast
it
is
of
their
feast
they
sing
it
has
been
stated
that
williams
was
not
imaginative
but
a
few
years
of
life
in
climates
alien
and
intemperate
had
disordered
his
nerves
there
was
that
in
the
rhythms
of
the
hymn
which
made
bristle
his
flesh
suddenly
when
they
were
very
near
the
voices
ceased
leaving
a
legacy
of
silence
more
sinister
than
themselves
and
now
the
black
spaces
between
the
trees
were
relieved
by
bits
of
white
that
were
the
eyeballs
and
teeth
of
mahamo
brethren
it
was
of
their
feast
it
was
of
you
they
sang
said
mahamo
look
here
cried
williams
in
his
voice
of
a
man
not
to
be
trifled
with
look
here
if
you
he
was
silenced
by
sight
of
what
seemed
to
be
a
young
sapling
sprung
up
from
the
ground
within
a
yard
of
him
a
young
sapling
tremulous
with
a
root
of
steel
then
a
shadow
skimmed
the
air
and
another
spear
came
impinging
the
ground
within
an
inch
of
his
feet
as
he
turned
in
his
flight
he
saw
the
goods
so
neatly
arranged
at
his
orders
and
there
flashed
through
him
even
in
the
thick
of
the
spears
the
thought
that
he
would
be
a
grave
loss
to
his
employers
this
for
williams
was
not
less
than
the
goods
of
a
kind
easily
replaced
was
an
illusion
it
was
the
last
of
williams
illusions
a
recollection
and
let
us
strew
twain
wreaths
of
holly
and
of
yew
waller
one
out
of
many
christmas
days
abides
with
peculiar
vividness
in
my
memory
in
setting
down
however
clumsily
some
slight
record
of
it
i
feel
that
i
shall
be
discharging
a
duty
not
only
to
the
two
disparately
illustrious
men
who
made
it
so
very
memorable
but
also
to
all
young
students
of
english
and
scandinavian
literature
my
use
of
the
first
person
singular
delightful
though
that
pronoun
is
in
the
works
of
the
truly
gifted
jars
unspeakably
on
me
but
reasons
of
space
baulk
my
sober
desire
to
call
myself
merely
the
present
writer
or
the
infatuated
or
the
cowed
and
imponderable
young
person
who
was
in
attendance
in
the
third
week
of
december
taking
the
opportunity
of
a
brief
and
undeserved
vacation
i
went
to
venice
on
the
morning
after
my
arrival
in
answer
to
a
most
kind
and
cordial
summons
i
presented
myself
at
the
palazzo
rezzonico
intense
as
was
the
impression
he
always
made
even
in
london
i
think
that
those
of
us
who
met
robert
browning
only
in
the
stress
and
roar
of
that
metropolis
can
hardly
have
gauged
the
fullness
of
his
potentialities
for
impressing
venice
so
weak
so
quiet
as
ruskin
had
called
her
was
indeed
the
ideal
setting
for
one
to
whom
neither
of
those
epithets
could
by
any
possibility
have
been
deemed
applicable
the
steamboats
that
now
wake
the
echoes
of
the
canals
had
not
yet
been
imported
but
the
vitality
of
the
imported
poet
was
in
some
measure
a
preparation
for
them
it
did
not
however
find
me
quite
prepared
for
itself
and
i
am
afraid
that
some
minutes
must
have
elapsed
before
i
could
as
it
were
find
my
feet
in
the
torrent
of
his
geniality
and
high
spirits
and
give
him
news
of
his
friends
in
london
he
was
at
that
time
engaged
in
revising
the
of
dramatic
idylls
and
after
luncheon
to
which
he
very
kindly
bade
me
remain
he
read
aloud
certain
selected
passages
the
yellow
haze
of
a
wintry
venetian
sunshine
poured
in
through
the
vast
windows
of
his
making
an
aureole
around
his
silvered
head
i
would
give
much
to
live
that
hour
over
again
but
it
was
vouchsafed
in
days
before
the
browning
society
came
and
made
everything
so
simple
for
us
all
i
am
afraid
that
after
a
few
minutes
i
sat
enraptured
by
the
sound
rather
than
by
the
sense
of
the
lines
i
find
in
the
notes
i
made
of
the
occasion
that
i
figured
myself
as
plunging
through
some
enchanted
thicket
on
the
back
of
an
inspired
bull
that
evening
as
i
was
strolling
in
piazza
san
marco
my
thoughts
of
browning
were
all
of
a
sudden
scattered
by
the
vision
of
a
small
man
seated
at
one
of
the
tables
in
the
café
florian
this
was
and
my
heart
leapt
like
a
young
trout
when
i
saw
that
it
could
be
none
other
than
henrik
ibsen
whether
joy
or
fear
was
the
predominant
emotion
in
me
i
should
be
hard
put
to
it
to
say
it
had
been
my
privilege
to
correspond
extensively
with
the
great
scandinavian
and
to
be
frequently
received
by
him
some
years
earlier
than
the
date
of
which
i
write
in
rome
in
that
city
haunted
by
the
shades
of
so
many
emperors
and
popes
i
had
felt
comparatively
at
ease
even
in
presence
but
seated
here
in
the
homelier
decay
of
venice
closely
buttoned
in
his
black
surcoat
and
crowned
with
his
uncompromising
with
the
lights
of
the
piazza
flashing
back
wanly
from
his
spectacles
and
his
lips
like
some
steel
trap
into
which
our
poor
humanity
had
just
fallen
he
seemed
to
constitute
a
menace
under
which
the
boldest
might
well
quail
nevertheless
i
took
my
courage
in
both
hands
and
laid
it
as
a
kind
of
votive
offering
on
the
little
table
before
him
my
reward
was
in
the
surprising
amiability
that
he
then
and
afterwards
displayed
my
travelling
had
indeed
been
doubly
blessed
for
whilst
my
subsequent
afternoons
were
spent
in
browning
presence
my
evenings
fell
with
regularity
into
the
charge
of
ibsen
one
of
these
evenings
is
for
me
prouder
more
laurel
than
the
rest
as
having
been
the
occasion
when
he
read
to
me
the
of
a
play
which
he
had
just
completed
he
was
staying
at
the
hôtel
danieli
an
edifice
famous
for
having
been
rather
more
than
forty
years
previously
the
socket
in
which
the
flame
of
an
historic
had
finally
sunk
and
guttered
out
with
no
inconsiderable
accompaniment
of
smoke
and
odour
it
was
there
in
an
upper
room
that
i
now
made
acquaintance
with
a
couple
very
different
from
george
sand
and
alfred
de
musset
though
destined
to
become
hardly
less
famous
than
they
i
refer
to
torvald
and
nora
helmer
my
host
read
to
me
with
the
utmost
vivacity
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
apartment
and
i
remember
that
in
the
scene
where
nora
helmer
dances
the
tarantella
her
creator
instinctively
executed
a
few
illustrative
steps
during
those
days
i
felt
very
much
as
might
a
minnow
swimming
to
and
fro
between
leviathan
on
the
one
hand
and
behemoth
on
the
other
a
minnow
tremulously
pleased
but
ever
wistful
for
some
means
of
bringing
his
two
enormous
acquaintances
together
on
the
afternoon
of
december
i
confided
to
browning
my
aspiration
he
had
never
heard
of
this
brother
poet
and
dramatist
whose
fame
indeed
was
at
that
time
still
mainly
boreal
but
he
cried
out
with
the
greatest
heartiness
capital
bring
him
round
with
you
at
one
for
turkey
and
i
betook
myself
straight
to
the
hôtel
danieli
hoping
against
hope
that
ibsen
sole
answer
would
not
be
a
comminatory
grunt
and
an
instant
rupture
of
all
future
relations
with
myself
at
first
he
was
indeed
resolute
not
to
go
he
had
never
heard
of
this
herr
browning
it
was
one
of
the
strengths
of
his
strange
crustacean
genius
that
he
never
had
heard
of
anybody
i
took
it
on
myself
to
say
that
herr
browning
would
send
his
private
gondola
propelled
by
his
two
gondoliers
to
conduct
herr
ibsen
to
the
scene
of
the
festivity
i
think
it
was
this
prospect
that
made
him
gradually
unbend
for
he
had
already
acquired
that
taste
for
pomp
and
circumstance
which
was
so
notable
a
characteristic
of
his
later
years
i
hastened
back
to
the
palazzo
rezzonico
before
he
could
change
his
mind
i
need
hardly
say
that
browning
instantly
consented
to
send
the
gondola
so
large
and
lovable
was
his
nature
that
had
he
owned
a
thousand
of
those
conveyances
he
would
not
have
hesitated
to
send
out
the
whole
fleet
in
honour
of
any
friend
of
any
friend
of
his
next
day
as
i
followed
ibsen
down
the
danielian
into
the
expectant
gondola
my
emotion
was
such
that
i
was
tempted
to
snatch
from
him
his
umbrella
and
spread
it
out
over
his
head
like
the
umbrella
beneath
which
the
doges
of
days
gone
by
had
made
their
appearances
in
public
it
was
perhaps
a
pity
that
i
repressed
this
impulse
ibsen
seemed
to
be
already
regretting
that
he
had
unbent
i
could
not
help
thinking
as
we
floated
along
the
riva
schiavoni
that
he
looked
like
some
particularly
ruthless
member
of
the
council
of
ten
i
did
however
try
faintly
to
attune
him
in
some
sort
to
the
spirit
of
our
host
and
of
the
day
of
the
year
i
adumbrated
browning
outlook
on
life
translating
into
norwegian
i
well
remember
the
words
god
in
his
heaven
all
right
with
the
world
in
fact
i
can
not
charge
myself
with
not
having
done
what
i
could
i
can
only
lament
that
it
was
not
enough
when
we
marched
into
the
browning
was
seated
at
the
piano
playing
i
think
a
toccata
of
galuppi
on
seeing
us
he
brought
his
hands
down
with
a
great
crash
on
the
keyboard
seemed
to
reach
us
in
one
astonishing
bound
across
the
marble
floor
and
clapped
ibsen
loudly
on
either
shoulder
wishing
him
the
merriest
of
merry
christmases
ibsen
under
this
sudden
impact
stood
firm
as
a
rock
and
it
flitted
through
my
brain
that
here
at
last
was
solved
the
old
problem
of
what
would
happen
if
an
irresistible
force
met
an
immoveable
mass
but
it
was
obvious
that
the
rock
was
not
rejoicing
in
the
moment
of
victory
i
was
tartly
asked
whether
i
had
not
explained
to
herr
browning
that
his
guest
did
not
understand
english
i
hastily
rectified
my
omission
and
thenceforth
our
host
spoke
in
italian
ibsen
though
he
understood
that
language
fairly
well
was
averse
to
speaking
it
such
remarks
as
he
made
in
the
course
of
the
meal
to
which
we
presently
sat
down
were
made
in
norwegian
and
translated
by
myself
browning
while
he
was
carving
the
turkey
asked
ibsen
whether
he
had
visited
any
of
the
venetian
theatres
ibsen
reply
was
that
he
never
visited
theatres
browning
laughed
his
great
laugh
and
cried
right
we
poets
who
write
plays
must
give
the
theatres
as
wide
a
berth
as
possible
we
are
wanted
there
how
so
asked
ibsen
browning
looked
a
little
puzzled
and
i
had
to
explain
that
in
northern
europe
herr
ibsen
plays
were
frequently
performed
at
this
i
seemed
to
see
on
browning
face
a
slight
shadow
so
swift
and
transient
a
shadow
as
might
be
cast
by
a
swallow
flying
across
a
sunlit
garden
an
instant
and
it
was
gone
i
was
glad
however
to
be
able
to
soften
my
statement
by
adding
that
herr
ibsen
had
in
his
recent
plays
abandoned
the
use
of
verse
the
trouble
was
that
in
browning
company
he
seemed
practically
to
have
abandoned
the
use
of
prose
too
when
moreover
he
did
speak
it
was
always
in
a
sense
contrary
to
that
of
our
host
the
risorgimento
was
a
theme
always
very
near
to
the
great
heart
of
browning
and
on
this
occasion
he
hymned
it
with
more
than
his
usual
animation
and
resource
if
indeed
that
were
possible
he
descanted
especially
on
the
vast
increase
that
had
accrued
to
the
sum
of
human
happiness
in
italy
since
the
success
of
that
remarkable
movement
when
ibsen
rapped
out
the
conviction
that
what
italy
needed
was
to
be
invaded
and
conquered
once
and
for
all
by
austria
i
feared
that
an
explosion
was
inevitable
but
hardly
had
my
translation
of
the
inauspicious
sentiment
been
uttered
when
the
was
borne
into
the
room
flaming
on
its
dish
i
clapped
my
hands
wildly
at
sight
of
it
in
the
english
fashion
and
was
intensely
relieved
when
the
yet
more
resonant
applause
of
robert
browning
followed
mine
disaster
had
been
averted
by
a
crowning
mercy
but
i
am
afraid
that
ibsen
thought
us
both
quite
mad
the
next
topic
that
was
started
harmless
though
it
seemed
at
first
was
fraught
with
yet
graver
peril
the
world
of
scholarship
was
at
that
time
agitated
by
the
recent
discovery
of
what
might
or
might
not
prove
to
be
a
fragment
of
sappho
browning
proclaimed
his
unshakeable
belief
in
the
authenticity
of
these
verses
to
my
surprise
ibsen
whom
i
had
been
unprepared
to
regard
as
a
classical
scholar
said
positively
that
they
had
not
been
written
by
sappho
browning
challenged
him
to
give
a
reason
a
literal
translation
of
the
reply
would
have
been
because
no
woman
ever
was
capable
of
writing
a
fragment
of
good
poetry
imagination
reels
at
the
effect
this
would
have
had
on
the
recipient
of
sonnets
from
the
portuguese
the
agonised
interpreter
throwing
honour
to
the
winds
babbled
some
wholly
fallacious
version
of
the
words
again
the
situation
had
been
saved
but
it
was
of
the
kind
that
does
not
even
in
furthest
retrospect
lose
its
power
to
freeze
the
heart
and
constrict
the
diaphragm
i
was
fain
to
thank
heaven
when
immediately
after
the
termination
of
the
meal
ibsen
rose
bowed
to
his
host
and
bade
me
express
his
thanks
for
the
entertainment
out
on
the
grand
canal
in
the
gondola
which
had
again
been
placed
at
our
disposal
his
passion
for
documents
that
might
bear
on
his
work
was
quickly
manifested
he
asked
me
whether
herr
browning
had
ever
married
receiving
an
emphatically
affirmative
reply
he
inquired
whether
fru
browning
had
been
happy
loth
though
i
was
to
cast
a
blight
on
his
interest
in
the
matter
i
conveyed
to
him
with
all
possible
directness
the
impression
that
elizabeth
barrett
had
assuredly
been
one
of
those
wives
who
do
not
dance
tarantellas
nor
slam
he
did
not
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
make
further
mention
of
browning
either
then
or
afterwards
browning
himself
however
thanked
me
warmly
next
day
for
having
introduced
my
friend
to
him
a
capital
fellow
he
exclaimed
and
then
for
a
moment
seemed
as
though
he
were
about
to
qualify
this
estimate
but
ended
by
merely
repeating
a
capital
fellow
ibsen
remained
in
venice
some
weeks
after
my
return
to
london
he
was
it
may
be
conjectured
bent
on
a
specially
close
study
of
the
bride
of
the
adriatic
because
her
marriage
had
been
not
altogether
a
happy
one
but
there
appears
to
be
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
he
went
again
either
of
his
own
accord
or
by
invitation
to
the
palazzo
rezzonico
of
christmas
there
was
a
man
came
to
an
inn
by
night
and
after
he
had
called
three
times
they
should
open
him
the
door
though
why
three
times
and
not
three
times
three
nor
thirty
times
thirty
which
is
the
number
of
the
little
stone
devils
that
make
mows
at
aloesius
of
ledera
over
against
the
marshes
to
this
day
nor
three
hundred
times
three
hundred
which
is
a
bestial
number
nor
three
thousand
times
upon
my
soul
i
know
not
and
nor
do
you
when
then
this
jolly
fellow
had
three
times
cried
out
shouted
yelled
holloa
loudly
besought
caterwauled
brayed
sung
out
and
roared
he
did
by
the
same
token
set
himself
to
beat
hammer
bang
pummel
and
knock
at
the
door
now
the
door
was
oak
it
had
been
grown
in
the
forest
of
boulevoise
hewn
in
seasoned
in
south
hoxton
hinged
nowhere
in
particular
and
panelled
and
that
most
abominably
well
in
arque
where
the
peasants
sell
their
souls
for
skill
in
such
handicraft
but
our
man
knew
nothing
of
all
this
which
had
he
known
it
would
have
mattered
little
enough
to
him
for
a
reason
which
i
propose
to
tell
in
the
next
sentence
the
door
was
opened
as
to
the
reasons
why
it
was
not
opened
sooner
these
are
most
tediously
set
forth
in
professor
sir
slibby
with
historic
doors
as
also
in
a
fragment
at
one
time
attributed
to
oleaginus
silo
but
now
proven
a
forgery
by
miss
evans
enough
for
our
purpose
merry
reader
of
mine
that
the
door
was
opened
the
man
as
men
will
went
in
and
there
for
god
sake
and
by
the
grace
of
mary
mother
let
us
leave
him
for
the
truth
of
it
is
that
his
strength
was
all
in
his
lungs
and
himself
a
poor
weak
bloke
anyway
who
at
trinity
hall
had
spent
the
most
of
his
time
in
reading
hume
that
was
satan
lackey
and
after
taking
his
degree
did
a
little
in
the
way
of
imperial
finance
of
him
it
was
that
lord
abraham
hart
that
statesman
said
this
young
man
has
the
root
of
the
matter
in
him
i
quote
the
epigram
rather
for
its
perfect
form
than
for
its
truth
for
once
lord
abraham
was
deceived
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
he
was
at
this
time
being
plagued
almost
out
of
his
wits
by
the
vile
though
cleverly
engineered
agitation
for
the
compulsory
of
the
rondoosdop
development
company
afterwards
in
wormwood
scrubbs
his
lordship
admitted
that
his
estimate
of
his
young
friend
had
perhaps
been
pitched
too
high
in
dartmoor
he
has
since
revoked
it
altogether
with
that
manliness
for
which
the
empire
so
loved
him
when
he
was
at
large
now
the
young
man
name
was
dimby
trot
dimby
and
his
mother
had
been
a
clupton
so
that
but
had
i
not
already
dismissed
him
indeed
i
only
mentioned
him
because
it
seemed
that
his
going
to
that
inn
might
put
me
on
track
of
that
one
great
ultimate
and
final
true
thing
i
am
purposed
to
say
about
christmas
do
ask
me
yet
what
that
thing
is
truth
dwells
in
no
man
but
is
a
shy
beast
you
must
hunt
as
you
may
in
the
forests
that
are
round
about
the
walls
of
heaven
and
i
do
hereby
curse
gibbet
and
denounce
in
perpetuam
atque
the
man
who
hunts
in
a
crafty
or
calculating
way
as
lying
low
nosing
for
scents
squinting
for
trails
crawling
noiselessly
till
he
shall
come
near
to
his
quarry
and
then
taking
careful
aim
to
him
who
hunts
truth
in
the
honest
fashion
of
men
which
is
going
blindly
at
it
following
his
first
scent
if
such
there
be
or
if
none
none
scrambling
over
boulders
fording
torrents
winding
his
horn
plunging
into
thickets
skipping
firing
off
his
gun
in
the
air
continually
and
then
ramming
in
some
more
ammunition
anyhow
with
a
laugh
and
a
curse
if
the
charge
explode
in
his
own
jolly
face
the
chances
are
he
will
bring
home
in
his
bag
nothing
but
a
he
trod
on
by
accident
not
the
less
his
is
the
true
sport
and
the
essential
stuff
of
holiness
as
touching
christmas
but
there
is
nothing
like
verse
to
clear
the
mind
heat
the
blood
and
make
very
humble
the
heart
rouse
thee
muse
one
christmas
night
in
pontgibaud
a
man
with
a
drum
went
to
and
fro
merry
eyes
two
cheeks
nor
not
a
citril
within
without
but
heard
the
racket
and
heard
the
rout
and
marvelled
what
it
was
all
about
who
shall
shrive
beelzebub
he
whacked
so
hard
the
drum
was
split
out
lept
saint
gabriel
from
it
who
spread
his
wings
and
up
he
went
nor
ever
paused
in
his
ascent
till
he
had
reached
the
firmament
that
what
i
shall
sing
please
god
at
dawn
standing
on
the
high
green
barrow
at
storrington
where
the
bones
of
men
are
yea
at
dawn
on
storrington
barrow
i
beg
or
borrow
a
bow
and
arrow
and
shoot
sleek
sorrow
through
the
marrow
the
floods
are
out
and
the
ford
is
narrow
the
stars
hang
dead
and
my
limbs
are
lead
but
ale
is
gold
and
there
good
on
the
cuckfield
side
of
storrington
barrow
this
too
i
shall
sing
and
other
songs
that
are
yet
to
write
in
pagham
i
shall
sing
them
again
and
again
in
little
dewstead
in
hornside
i
shall
rewrite
them
and
at
the
scythe
and
turtle
in
liphook
if
i
have
patience
annotate
them
at
selsey
they
will
be
very
damnably
in
the
way
and
i
do
at
all
know
what
i
shall
do
with
them
at
selsey
such
then
as
i
see
it
is
the
whole
pith

and
inner
meaning
beauty
intrinsic
and
extrinsic
and
right
character
of
christmas
feast
urbs
atque

pray
for
my
soul
a
straight
talk
to
snt
george
a
christmas
play
when
a
public
man
lays
his
hand
on
his
heart
and
declares
that
his
conduct
needs
no
apology
the
audience
hastens
to
put
up
its
umbrellas
against
the
particularly
severe
downpour
of
apologies
in
store
for
it
i
wont
give
the
customary
warning
my
conduct
shrieks
aloud
for
apology
and
you
are
in
for
a
thorough
drenching
flatly
i
stole
this
play
the
one
valid
excuse
for
the
theft
would
be
mental
starvation
that
excuse
i
shant
plead
i
could
have
made
a
dozen
better
plays
than
this
out
of
my
own
head
you
do
suppose
shakespeare
was
so
vacant
in
the
upper
storey
that
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
rummage
through
cinquecento
romances
townley
mysteries
and
suchlike
insanitary
rubbishheaps
in
order
that
he
might
fish
out
enough
scraps
for
his
artistic
fangs
to
fasten
on
depend
on
it
there
were
plenty
of
decent
original
notions
seething
behind
yon
marble
brow
why
did
our
william
use
them
he
was
too
lazy
and
so
am
i
it
is
easier
to
give
a
new
twist
to
somebody
else
story
that
you
take
readymade
than
to
perform
that
form
of
skilled
labor
which
consists
in
giving
artistic
coherence
to
a
story
that
you
have
conceived
roughly
for
yourself
a
literary
gentleman
once
hoisted
a
theory
that
there
are
only
possible
stories
in
the
world
this
i
say
it
with
no
deference
at
all
is
bosh
there
are
as
many
possible
stories
in
the
world
as
there
are
microbes
in
the
shelves
of
a
literary
gentleman
den
on
the
other
hand
it
is
perfectly
true
that
only
a
baker
dozen
of
these
have
got
themselves
told
the
reason
lies
in
that
bland
unalterable
resolve
to
shirk
honest
work
by
which
you
recognise
the
artist
as
surely
as
you
recognise
the
leopard
by
his
spots
in
so
far
as
i
am
an
artist
i
am
a
loafer
and
if
you
expect
me
in
that
line
to
do
anything
but
loaf
you
will
get
the
shock
your
romantic
folly
deserves
the
only
difference
between
me
and
my
rivals
past
and
present
is
that
i
have
the
decency
to
be
ashamed
of
myself
so
that
if
you
are
not
too
bemused
and
bedevilled
by
my
brilliancy
to
kick
me
downstairs
you
may
rely
on
me
to
cheerfully
lend
a
foot
in
the
operation
but
while
i
have
my
share
of
judicial
vindictiveness
against
crime
im
not
going
to
talk
the
common
judicial
cant
about
brutality
making
a
better
man
of
the
criminal
i
havent
the
slightest
doubt
that
i
would
thieve
again
at
the
earliest
opportunity
meanwhile
be
so
good
as
to
listen
to
the
evidence
on
the
present
charge
in
the
december
after
i
was
first
cast
ashore
at
holyhead
i
had
to
go
down
to
dorsetshire
in
those
days
the
more
enterprising
used
still
to
annually
dress
themselves
up
in
order
to
tickle
the
gentry
into
disbursing
the
money
needed
to
supplement
a
wage
they
called
themselves
the
christmas
mummers
and
performed
a
play
entitled
snt
george
as
my
education
had
been
of
the
typical
irish
kind
and
the
ideas
on
which
i
had
been
nourished
were
precisely
the
ideas
that
once
in
tara
hall
were
regarded
as
dangerous
novelties
snt
george
staggered
me
with
the
sense
of
being
suddenly
bumped
up
against
a
thing
which
lay
centuries
ahead
of
the
time
i
had
been
born
into
being
in
point
of
fact
only
a
matter
of
five
hundred
years
old
it
would
have
the
same
effect
on
the
average
london
playgoer
if
it
was
produced
in
a
west
end
theatre
the
plot
was
simple
it
is
set
forth
in
thomas
hardy
return
of
the
native
but
as
the
people
who
read
my
books
have
no
energy
left
over
to
cope
with
other
authors
i
must
supply
an
outline
of
it
myself
entered
first
of
all
the
english
knight
announcing
his
determination
to
fight
and
vanquish
the
turkish
knight
a
vastly
superior
swordsman
who
promptly
made
mincemeat
of
him
after
the
saracen
had
celebrated
his
victory
in
verse
and
proclaimed
himself
the
world
champion
entered
snt
george
who
after
some
preliminary
patriotic
flourishes
promptly
made
mincemeat
of
the
saracen
to
the
blank
amazement
of
an
audience
which
included
several
retired
army
officers
snt
george
however
saved
his
face
by
the
usual
expedient
of
the
victorious
british
general
attributing
to
providence
a
result
which
by
no
polite
stretch
of
casuistry
could
have
been
traced
to
the
operations
of
his
own
brain
but
here
the
dramatist
was
confronted
by
another
difficulty
there
being
no
curtain
to
ring
down
how
were
the
two
corpses
to
be
got
gracefully
rid
of
entered
therefore
the
physician
and
brought
them
both
to
life
any
one
objecting
to
this
scene
on
the
score
of
romantic
improbability
is
hereby
referred
to
the
royal
college
of
physicians
or
to
the
directors
of
any
accredited
medical
journal
who
will
hail
with
delight
this
opportunity
of
proving
once
and
for
all
that
is
the
of
the
faculty
such
then
is
the
play
that
i
have
stolen
for
all
the
many
pleasing
esthetic
qualities
you
will
find
in
it
dramatic
inventiveness
humor
and
pathos
eloquence
elfin
glamor
and
the
like
you
must
bless
the
original
author
of
these
things
i
have
only
the
usufruct
to
me
the
play
owes
nothing
but
the
stiffening
of
civistic
conscience
that
has
been
crammed
in
modest
not
a
bit
of
it
it
is
my
civistic
conscience
that
makes
a
man
of
me
and
incidentally
makes
this
play
a
masterpiece
nothing
could
have
been
easier
for
me
if
i
were
some
one
else
than
to
perform
my
task
in
that
spirit
which
so
grossly
flatters
the
sensibilities
of
the
average
citizen
by
its
assumption
that
he
is
sharp
enough
to
be
dismayed
by
what
stares
him
in
the
face
charles
dickens
had
lucid
intervals
in
which
he
was
vaguely
conscious
of
the
abuses
around
him
but
his
spasmodic
efforts
to
expose
these
brought
him
into
contact
with
realities
so
agonising
to
his
highstrung
literary
nerves
that
he
invariably
sank
back
into
debauches
of
unsocial
optimism
even
the
swan
of
avon
had
his
glimpses
of
the
havoc
of
displacement
wrought
by
elizabethan
romanticism
in
the
social
machine
which
had
been
working
with
tolerable
smoothness
under
the
prosaic
guidance
of
henry
the
time
was
out
of
joint
and
the
swan
recognising
that
he
was
the
last
person
to
ever
set
it
right
consoled
himself
by
offering
the
world
a
soothing
doctrine
of
despair
not
for
me
thank
you
that
swansdown
pillow
i
refuse
as
flatly
to
fuddle
myself
in
the
shop
of
shakespeare
druggist
as
to
stimulate
myself
with
the
juicy
joints
of
dickens
family
butcher
of
these
and
suchlike
pernicious
establishments
my
patronage
consists
in
weaving
round
the
a
entanglement
of
dialectic
and
then
training
my
moral
on
the
customers
in
this
devilish
function
i
have
as
you
know
acquired
by
practice
a
tremendous
technical
skill
and
but
for
the
more
or
less
innocent
pride
i
take
in
showing
off
my
accomplishment
to
all
and
sundry
i
doubt
whether
even
my
iron
nerves
would
be
proof
against
the
horrors
that
have
impelled
me
to
thus
perfect
myself
in
my
nonage
i
believed
humanity
could
be
reformed
if
only
it
were
intelligently
preached
at
for
a
sufficiently
long
period
this
first
fine
careless
rapture
i
could
no
more
recapture
at
my
age
than
i
could
recapture
hoopingcough
or
nettlerash
one
by
one
i
have
flung
all
political
nostra
overboard
till
there
remain
only
dynamite
and
scientific
breeding
my
touching
faith
in
these
saves
me
from
pessimism
i
believe
in
the
future
but
this
only
makes
the
present
which
i
foresee
as
going
strong
for
a
couple
of
million
of
years
or
so
all
the
more
excruciating
by
contrast
for
casting
into
dramatic
form
a
compendium
of
my
indictments
of
the
present
from
a
purely
political
standpoint
the
old
play
of
snt
george
occurred
to
me
as
having
exactly
the
framework
i
needed
in
the
person
of
the
turkish
knight
i
could
embody
that
howling
chaos
which
does
duty
among
us
for
a
the
english
knight
would
accordingly
be
the
liberal
party
whose
efforts
whenever
it
is
in
favor
with
the
electorate
to
reduce
chaos
to
order
by
emulating
in
foreign
politics
the
blackguardism
of
a
metternich
or
bismarck
and
in
home
politics
the
spirited
attitudinisings
of
a
garibaldi
or
cavor
are
foredoomed
to
the
failure
which
its
inherent
oldmaidishness
must
always
win
for
the
liberal
party
in
all
undertakings
whatsoever
snt
george
is
of
course
myself
but
here
my
very
aptitude
in
controversy
tripped
me
up
as
playwright
owing
to
my
nack
of
going
straight
to
the
root
of
the
matter
in
hand
and
substituting
before
you
can
say
jack
robinson
a
truth
for
every
fallacy
and
a
natural
law
for
every
convention
the
scene
of
snt
george
bernard
shaw
victory
over
the
turkish
knight
came
out
too
short
for
theatrical
purposes
i
calculated
that
the
play
as
it
stood
would
not
occupy
more
than
five
hours
in
performance
i
therefore
departed
from
the
original
scheme
so
far
as
to
provide
the
turkish
knight
with
three
attendant
monsters
severally
named
the
good
the
beyootiful
and
the
and
representing
in
themselves
the
current
forms
of
religion
art
and
science
these
three
snt
george
successively
challenges
tackles
and
flattens
out
the
first
as
lunacy
the
second
as
harlotry
the
third
as
witchcraft
but
even
so
the
play
would
not
be
long
enough
had
i
not
padded
a
good
deal
of
buffoonery
into
the
scene
where
the
five
corpses
are
brought
back
to
life
the
restorative
physician
symbolises
that
irresistible
force
of
human
stupidity
by
which
the
rottenest
and
basest
institutions
are
enabled
to
thrive
in
the
teeth
of
the
logic
that
has
demolished
them
thus
for
the
author
the
close
of
the
play
is
essentially
tragic
but
what
is
death
to
him
is
fun
to
you
and
my
buffooneries
wont
offend
any
of
you

to

take
the
cause
of
the
bicker
enough
that
they
were
at
sulks
here
for
a
sight
of
the
girl
johannes
sargent
that
swift
giant
from
the
new
world
had
already
flung
her
on
canvas
with
a
brace
of
sisters
she
outstands
there
a
virgin
hair
like
ravelled
flax
and
coiffed
in
the
fashion
of
the
period
neck
like
a
giraffe
lips
shaped
for
kissing
rather
than
smiling
eyes
like
a
giraffe
again
breasts
like
a
boy
and
something
of
a
boy
in
the
total
aspect
of
her
she
has
arms
a
trifle
long
even
for
such
height
as
hers
fingers
very
long
too
with
nails
trimmed
to
a
point
she
looks
out
slantwise
conscious
of
her
beauty
and
perhaps
of
certain
other
things
fire
under
that
ice
i
conjecture
red
corpuscles
rampant
behind
that
meek
white
mask
of
hers
in
hoc
anno
pulcherrima
is
the
verdict
of
a
contemporary
journal
for
read
no
slur
that
on
the
rest
of
the
bevy
very
much
as
johannes
had
seen
her
did
she
appear
now
to
the
cits
as
the
cabriolet
swung
past
them
paramount
there
she
was
still
more
paramount
here
yet
this
geoffrey
was
not
in
the
secret
journal
of
mary
jane
in
the
palace
of
geoffrey
father
who
gat
his
barony
by
beer
note
is
made
of
his
lovely
blue
eyes
complexion
like
a
blush
rose
hands
like
a
girl

like
a
again
yellow
curls
close
cropped
and
for

so
young
is
he
yet
such
a
shadow
as
amber
might
cast

i
would

time
urges
though
the
cabrioleteer
thrashes
his
horse
me
with
it
to
a
canter
and
plunges
into
soho
some
wagon
athwart
the
path
gives
pause
angelica
looking
about
her
bites
lip
for
this
is
the
street
of
wardour
wherein
say
all
the
chronicles
most
absolutely
she
and
geoffrey
had
first
met
and
plit
their
troth
methinks
cries
she
loud
and
clear
to
the
wagoner
and
pointing
finger
at
geoffrey
the
devil
must
be
between
your
shafts
to
make
a
mock
of
me
in
this
conjunction
the
which
is
truly
of
his
own
doing
sweet
madam
says
geoffrey
who
was
also
called
the
ready
shall
i
help
harness
you
at
his
side
though
for
my
part
i
doubt
supererogant
in
that
he
buckled
you
to
his
service
or
ever
the
priest
dipped
you
a
bitter
jest
this
and
the
thought
of
it
still
tingled
on
the
girl
cheek
and
clawed
her
heart
when
geoffrey
handed
her
down
at
the
portico
of
drury
lane
theatre
a
new
pantomime
was
afoot
father
that
bluff
red
baron
had
chartered
a
box
was
already
there
with
his
lady
and
others
lily
among
peonies
angelica
sat
brooding
her
eyes
fastened
on
the
stage
geoffrey
behind
her
chair
brooding
by
the
same
token
presto
he
saw
a
flood
of
pink
rush
up
her
shoulders
to
her
ears
the
principal
boy
had
just
skipped
on
to
the
stage
no
boy
at
all
god
be
witness
but
one
mistress
tina
vandeleur
very
apt
in
masquerado
and
seeming
true
boy
enough
to
the
guileless
stout
of
leg
with
a
tricksy
plume
to
his
cap
and
the
swagger
of
one
who
would
beard
the
saints
for
a
wager
this
aladdin
was
just
such
a
galliard
as
angelica
had
often
fondled
in
her
dreams
he
lept
straight
into
the
closet
of
her
heart
and
deus
she
cried
maugre
my
maidenhood
i
will
follow
those
pretty
heels
round
the
earth
cried
geoffrey
yea
and
will
not
i
presently
string
his
ham
to
save
your
panting
cried
the
groundlings
a
moment
after
geoffrey
forgot
his
spleen
cupid
had
noosed
him
bound
him
tight
to
the
widow
twankey
this
was
a
woman
most
unlike
to
angelica
i
grant
you
but
into
the
bargain
robustious
and
puffed
bravely
out
with
hot
vital
essences
seemed
so
to
geoffrey
at
least
who
had
no
smattering
of
theatres
and
knew
not
his
cynosure
to
be
none
other
than
master
willie
joffers
prime
buffo
of
the
day
like
angelica
he
had
had
fond
visions
and
lo
here
the
very
lady
of
them
says
he
to
angelica
i
am
heartset
on
this
widow
by
so
much
the
better
she
laughs
i
to
my
peacock
you
to
your
peahen
with
a
godspeed
from
each
to
other
how
to
snare
the
birds
a
pretty
problem
the
fowling
was
like
to
be
delicate
so
hale
a
strutter
as
aladdin
could
not
lack
for
bonamies
will
he
deign
me
wondered
meek
angelica
this
widow
thought
geoffrey
is
belike
no
widow
at
all
but
a
modest
wife
with
a
yea
for
no
man
but
her
lord
head
to
head
they
took
counsel
cudgelled
their
wits
for
some
proper
vantage
of
a
sudden
geoffrey
clapped
hand
to
thigh
student
of
boccaccio
heveletius
and
other
sages
he
had
the
clue
in
his
palm
a
whisper
from
him
a
nod
from
angelica
and
the
twain
withdrew
from
the
box
into
the
corridor
without
there
back
to
back
they
disrobed
swiftly
each
tossing
to
other
every
garment
as
it
was
doffed
then
a
flurried
toilet
and
a
difficult
for
the
man
especially
but
hotness
of
desire
breeds
dexterity
when
they
turned
and
faced
each
other
angelica
was
such
a
boy
as
aladdin
would
not
spurn
as
page
geoffrey
such
a
girl
as
the
widow
might
well
covet
as
out
they
hied
under
the
stars
and
sought
way
to
the
postern
whereby
the
mummers
would
come
when
their
work
were
done
thereat
they
stationed
themselves
in
shadow
a
bitter
night
with
a
lather
of
snow
on
the
cobbles
but
they
were
heedless
of
that
love
and
their
dancing
hearts
warmed
them
they
waited
long
strings
of
muffled
figures
began
to
file
out
but
never
an
one
like
to
aladdin
or
the
widow
midnight
tolled
had
these
two
had
wind
of
the
ambuscado
and
crept
out
by
another
door
nay
patience
at
last
a
figure
showed
in
the
doorway
a
figure
cloaked
womanly
but
topped
with
face
of
aladdin
trousered
angelica
with
a
cry
darted
forth
from
the
shadow
to
mistress
vandeleur
eyes
she
was
as
truly
man
as
was
mistress
vandeleur
to
hers
thus
confronted
mistress
vandeleur
shrank
back
blushing
hot
nay
laughs
angelica
clipping
her
by
the
wrists
cold
boy
you
shall
not
so
easily
slip
me
a
pretty
girl
you
make
aladdin
but
love
pierces
such
disguise
as
a
rapier
might
pierce
lard
madman
unhandle
me
screams
the
actress
no
madman
i
as
well
you
know
answers
angelica
but
a
maid
whom
spurned
love
may
yet
madden
kiss
me
on
the
lips
while
they
struggle
another
figure
fills
the
postern
and
in
an
instant
angelica
is
torn
aside
by
master
willie
joffers
well
versed
for
all
his
mumming
in
matters
of
chivalry
kisses
for
such
coward
lips
cries
he
nay
but
a
swinge
to
silence
them
and
would
have
struck
trousered
angelica
full
on
the
mouth
but
décolleté
geoffrey
dizzard
crying
at
him
sweet
termagant
think
not
to
baffle
me
by
these
airs
of
manhood
had
sprung
in
the
way
and
on
his
own
nose
received
the
blow
he
staggered
and
spurting
blood
fell
up
go
the
buffo
hands
and
now
may
the
saints
whip
me
cries
he
for
a
tapster
of
girl
blood
and
fled
into
the
night
howling
like
a
dog
mistress
vandeleur
had
fled
already
down
on
her
knees
goes
angelica
to
stanch
geoffrey
flux
thus
far
straight
history
apocrypha
all
the
rest
you
shall
pick
your
own
sequel
as
for
instance
some
say
geoffrey
bled
to
the
death
whereby
stepped
master
joffers
to
the
scaffold
and
angelica
the
vandeleur
too
like
as
not
to
a
nunnery
others
have
it
he
lived
thanks
to
nurse
angelica
who
thereon
wed
suckled
him
twin
dizzards
in
due
season
joffers
they
say
had
wife
already
else
would
have
wed
the
vandeleur
for
sake
of
symmetry
dickens
i
had
often
wondered
why
when
people
talked
to
me
of
tintoretto
i
always
found
myself
thinking
of
turgéneff
it
seemed
to
me
strange
that
i
should
think
of
turgéneff
instead
of
thinking
of
tintoretto
for
at
first
sight
nothing
can
be
more
far
apart
than
the
slav
mind
and
the
flemish
but
one
morning
some
years
ago
while
i
was
musing
by
my
fireplace
in
victoria
street
dolmetsch
came
to
see
me
he
had
a
soiled
roll
of
music
under
his
left
arm
i
said
how
are
you
he
said
i
am
well
and
you
i
said
i
too
am
well
what
is
that
my
dear
dolmetsch
that
you
carry
under
your
left
arm
he
answered
it
is
a
mass
by
palestrina
will
you
read
me
the
score
i
asked
i
was
afraid
he
would
say
no
but
dolmetsch
is
not
one
of
those
men
who
say
no
and
he
read
me
the
score
he
did
not
read
very
well
but
i
had
never
heard
it
before
so
when
he
finished
i
begged
of
him
he
would
read
it
to
me
again
he
said
very
well
i
will
read
it
to
you
again
i
remember
his
exact
words
because
they
seemed
to
me
at
the
time
to
be
the
sort
of
thing
that
only
dolmetsch
could
have
said
it
was
a
foggy
morning
in
victoria
street
and
while
dolmetsch
read
again
the
first
few
bars
i
thought
how
renoir
would
have
loved
to
paint
in
such
an
atmosphere
the
tops
of
the
plane
trees
that
flaccidly
show
above
the
wall
of
buckingham
palace
why
had
i
never
been
invited
to
buckingham
palace
i
did
not
want
to
go
there
but
it
would
have
been
nice
to
have
been
asked
how
was
renoir
and
how
well
he
painted
from
that
subfusc
palette
my
roving
thoughts
were
caught
back
to
the
divine
score
which
arnold
dolmetsch
was
reading
to
me
how
well
placed
they
were
those
semibreves
could
anyone
but
palestrina
have
placed
them
so
nicely
i
wondered
what
girl
palestrina
was
courting
when
he
conceived
them
she
must
have
been
blonde
surely
and
with
narrow
flanks
there
are
moments
when
one
does
not
think
of
girls
are
there
not
dear
reader
and
i
swear
to
you
that
such
a
moment
came
to
me
while
dolmetsch
mumbled
the
last
two
bars
of
that
mass
the
notes
were
do
la
sol
do
fa
do
sol
la
and
as
he
mumbled
them
i
sat
upright
and
stared
into
space
for
it
had
become
suddenly
plain
to
me
why
when
people
talked
of
tintoretto
i
always
found
myself
thinking
of
turgéneff
i
do
not
say
that
this
story
that
i
have
told
to
you
is
a
very
good
story
and
i
am
afraid
that
i
have
not
well
told
it
some
day
when
i
have
time
i
should
like
to
it
but
meantime
i
let
it
stand
because
without
it
you
could
not
receive
what
is
upmost
in
my
thoughts
and
which
i
wish
you
to
share
with
me
without
it
what
i
am
yearning
to
say
might
seem
to
you
a
hard
saying
but
now
you
will
understand
me
there
never
was
a
writer
except
dickens
perhaps
you
have
never
heard
say
of
him
no
matter
till
a
few
days
past
he
was
only
a
name
to
me
i
remember
that
when
i
was
a
young
man
in
paris
i
read
a
praise
of
him
in
some
journal
but
in
those
days
i
was
kneeling
at
other
altars
i
was
scrubbing
other
doorsteps
so
has
it
been
ever
since
always
a
false
god
always
the
wrong
doorstep
i
am
sick
of
the
smell
of
the
incense
i
have
swung
to
this
and
that
false
god
zola
yeats
tous
ces
i
am
angry
to
have
got
housemaid
knee
because
i
got
it
on
doorsteps
that
led
to
nowhere
there
is
but
one
doorstep
worth
scrubbing
the
doorstep
of
charles
dickens
did
he
write
many
books
i
know
not
it
does
not
greatly
matter
he
wrote
the
pickwick
papers
that
suffices
i
have
read
as
yet
but
one
chapter
describing
a
christmas
party
in
a
country
house
strange
that
anyone
should
have
essayed
to
write
about
anything
but
that
christmas
i
see
it
now
is
the
only
moment
in
which
men
and
women
are
really
alive
are
really
worth
writing
about
at
other
seasons
they
do
not
exist
for
the
purpose
of
art
i
spit
on
all
seasons
except
christmas
is
he
not
in
all
fiction
the
greatest
figure
this
wardell
this
old
squire
who
entertains
this
christmas
party
at
his
house
he
is
more
truthful
he
is
more
significant
than
any
figure
in
balzac
he
is
better
than
all
balzac
figures
rolled
into
one
i
used
to
kneel
on
that
doorstep
balzac
wrote
many
books
but
now
it
behoves
me
to
ask
myself
whether
he
ever
wrote
a
good
book
one
knows
that
he
used
to
write
for
fifteen
hours
at
a
stretch
gulping
down
coffee
all
the
while
but
it
does
not
follow
that
the
coffee
was
good
nor
does
it
follow
that
what
he
wrote
was
good
the
comédie
humaine
is
all
chicory
i
had
wished
for
some
years
to
say
this
i
am
glad
débarrassé
ma
poitrine
de
to
have
described
divinely
a
christmas
party
is
something
but
it
is
not
everything
the
disengaging
of
the
erotic
motive
is
everything
is
the
only
touchstone
if
while
that
is
being
done
we
are
soothed
into
a
trance
a
nebulous
delirium
of
the
nerves
then
we
know
the
novelist
to
be
a
supreme
novelist
if
we
retain
consciousness
he
is
not
supreme
and
to
be
less
than
supreme
in
art
is
to
not
exist
dickens
disengages
the
erotic
motive
through
two
figures
winkle
a
sportman
and
miss
arabella
a
young
lady
with
boots
they
go
skating
he
helps
her
over
a
stile
can
one
not
well
see
her
she
steps
over
the
stile
and
her
shin
defines
itself
through
her
balbriggan
stocking
she
is
a
girl
and
she
looks
at
winkle
with
that
sensual
regard
that
sometimes
comes
when
the
wind
is
yes
it
is
a
wind
that
is
blowing
over
this
landscape
that
hals
or
winchoven
might
have
painted
no
winchoven
would
have
fumbled
it
with
but
hals
would
have
done
it
well
hals
would
have
approved
would
he
not
the
pollard
aspens
these
pollard
aspens
deciduous
and
wistful
which
the
rime
makes
glistening
that
field
how
well
ploughed
it
is
and
are
they
not
like
petticoats
those
clouds
yes
hals
would
have
stated
them
well
but
only
manet
could
have
stated
the
slope
of
the
thighs
of
the
girl
how
does
she
call
herself
arabella
it
is
a
so
hard
name
to
remember
as
she
steps
across
the
stile
manet
would
have
found
pleasure
in
her
cheeks
also
they
are
a
little
chapped
with
the
wind
that
makes
the
pollard
aspens
to
quiver
how
adorable
a
thing
it
is
a
girl
nose
that
the
wind
renders
red
we
may
tire
of
it
sometimes
because
we
sometimes
tire
of
all
things
but
winkle
does
not
know
this
is
arabella
his
mistress
if
she
is
not
she
has
been
or
at
any
rate
she
will
be
how
full
she
is
of
temperament
is
she
not
her
seem
a
little
carelessly
modelled
but
how
good
they
are
in
intention
how
well
placed
that
smut
on
her
left
cheek
strange
thoughts
of
her
surge
up
vaguely
in
me
as
i
watch
her
thoughts
that
i
can
not
express
in
english
elle
est
plus
vieille
que
les
roches
entre
lesquelles
elle
assise
comme
le
vampire
elle
a
été
fréquemment
morte
et
a
appris
les
secrets
du
tombeau
et
plongée
dans
des
