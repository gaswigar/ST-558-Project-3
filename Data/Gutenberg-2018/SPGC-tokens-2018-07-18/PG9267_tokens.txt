with

in

and
turned
a

chapter
i
the
old
man
sister
the
weekly
mail
had
just
arrived
at
the
flying
u
ranch
shorty
who
had
made
the
trip
to
dry
lake
on
horseback
that
afternoon
tossed
the
bundle
to
the
old
man
and
was
halfway
to
the
stable
when
he
was
called
back
peremptorily
shorty
shorty
hi
shorty
kicked
his
steaming
horse
in
the
ribs
and
swung
round
in
the
path
bringing
up
before
the
porch
with
a
jerk
where
this
letter
been
demanded
the
old
man
with
some
excitement
james
whitmore
cattleman
would
have
been
greatly
surprised
had
he
known
that
his
cowboys
were
in
the
habit
of
calling
him
the
old
man
behind
his
back
james
whitmore
did
not
consider
himself
old
though
he
was
constrained
to
admit
after
several
hours
in
the
saddle
that
rheumatism
had
searched
him
out
because
of
his
fourteen
years
of
roughing
it
he
said
also
there
was
a
place
on
the
crown
of
his
head
where
the
hair
was
thin
and
growing
thinner
every
day
of
his
life
though
he
did
not
realize
it
the
thin
spot
showed
now
as
he
stood
in
the
path
waving
a
square
envelope
aloft
before
shorty
who
regarded
it
with
supreme
indifference
not
so
shorty
horse
he
rolled
his
eyes
till
the
whites
showed
snorted
and
backed
away
from
the
fluttering
white
object
doggone
it
where
this
been
reiterated
james
accusingly
how
the
devil
do
i
know
retorted
shorty
forcing
his
horse
nearer
in
the
office
most
likely
i
got
it
with
the
rest
it
two
weeks
old
stormed
the
old
man
i
never
knew
it
to
fail
if
a
letter
says
anybody
coming
or
you
to
hurry
up
and
go
somewhere
to
meet
somebody
that
letter
the
one
that
monkeys
around
and
comes
when
the
last
dog
hung
a
letter
asking
yuh
if
yuh
do
want
to
get
rich
in
ten
days
sellin
books
or
something
hike
along
out
here
in
no
time
doggone
it
you
got
a
order
to
go
somewhere
queried
shorty
mildly
sympathetic
worse
than
that
groaned
james

sister

out
to
spend
the
summer
and
no
cook
but
patsy
and
she
ca

in
the
mess
house
and
the

looks
like

up
against

all
right
grinned
shorty
shorty

a
sort
of
foreman
and
was
allowed
much
freedom
of
speech
somebody

to
meet
her

shorty
having

all
that
it
was
important
to
know

clattering
down
the
long
slope
again
to
the
stable
it
was
supper
time
and
shorty
was
hungry
also
there
was
news
to
tell
and
he
was
curious
to
see
how
the
boys
would
take
it
he
was
just
turning
loose
the
horse
when
supper
was
called
he
hurried
back
up
the
hill
to
the
mess
house
performed
hasty
ablutions
in
the
tin
wash
basin
on
the
bench
beside
the
door
scrubbed
his
face
dry
on
the
roller
towel
and
took
his
place
at
the
long
table
within
any

for
me
jack
bates
looked
up
from
emptying
the
third
spoon
of

into
his
coffee

write
this
time

reached
a
long
arm
for
the
mulligan
how

uh
shorty
became
suddenly
engaged
in
cooling
his
coffee
enjoying
the
varied
emotions
depicted
on
the
faces
of
the
boys
who
coming
what
up
shorty
took
two
leisurely
gulps
before

jack

half
emptying

plate
patsy
had
hot
biscuits

consumption
maybe
or

the
table

a
diploma

at
yeah
that

means

a
short
fat
man
who
took
life
seriously

man
they

in
fine
irony

real
warm

a
reputation
for
mischief
i

cynically
there
just
two
bunches
to
choose
from

the
sweet
young
things
that
faint
away
at
sight
of
a
and
squawk
and
catch
at
your
arm
if
they
see
a
garter
snake
and
blush
if
you
happen
to
catch
their
eye
suddenly
and
cry
if
you
do
take
off
your
hat
every
time
you
see
them
a
mile
chip
held
out
his
cup
for
patsy
to
refill
yeah

run
up
against
that
brand
and
they
sure

and
smoke

she
try
to

everything
and
wind
up
by
making
a
darn
fool
of
herself
either

began
weary
i
bet
a
skinny
old
maid
with
a
peaked
nose
and
glasses
that
round
us
up
every
sunday
and
read
tracts
at
our
heads
and
come
down
on
us
with
both
feet
about
tobacco
hearts
and
whisky
livers
and
the
evils
and
devils
wrapped
up
in
a
cigarette
paper
i
seen
a
woman
doctor
once
she
was
stopping
at
the
t
down
when
i
was
for
them
and
say
she
was
a
holy
fright
she
had
us
fellows
going
south
before
a
week
i
stampeded
clean
off
the
range
soon
as
my
month
was
say
interrupted
cal
do
yuh
remember
that
picture
the
old
man
got
last
fall
of
his
sister
she
was
the
image
of
the
old
man
and
mighty
near
as
chip
thinking
of
the
morrow
drive
groaned
in
real
anguish
of
spirit

predicted
happy
jack
mournfully

returned
chip
dryly
if
the
old
girl

like
my
style
why

walking

all
taken
say
chip
suggested
jack
bates
you
size
her
up
at
the
depot
and
if
she
do
look
promising
just
slack
the
lines
on
antelope
hill
the
creams
do

rest
if

the
job
shorty
tactfully
pushed
back
his
chair
and
rose
you
fellows
want
to
git
too
gay
he
warned
the
old
man
just
beginning
to
forget
about
the
then
he
went
out
and
shut
the
door
after
him
the
boys
liked
shorty
he
believed
in
the
old
adage
about
wisdom
being
bliss
at
certain
times
and
the
boys
were
all
the
better
for
his
living
up
to
his
belief
he
knew
the
happy
family
would
stop
inside
the
limit
at
least
they
always
had
so
far
what
the
game
demanded
cal
when
the
door
closed
behind
their
indulgent
foreman
why
it
this
pass
the
syrup
happy
sunday
so
have
time
t
burn
we
dig
up
all
the
guns
we
can

on
the
ranch
t
pull

clear

the
ground
we

build
no
derrick
said
jack
witheringly
we
have
a
dummy
rigged
up
in
the
bunk
house
when
chip
and
the
doctor
heave
in
sight
on
top
of
the
grade
we
break
loose
down
here
with
our
bronks
and
our
guns
and
smoke
up
the
ranch
in
style
we
drag
out
strawman
and
lynch
him
to
the
big
gate
before
they
get
along
we
be
him
with
bullets
when
they
arrive
and
by
that
time
she
be
so
rattled
she
wo
know
whether
it
a
man
or
a
mule
we
got
strung
you
have
to
cut
down
your
victim
before
i
get
there
grinned
chip
i
never
could
get
the
creams
through
the
gate
with
a
man
hung
to
the
frame
they
spill
us
into
the
washout
by
the
old
shed
sure
as
that
be
all
right
the
old
maid
would
sure
know
she
was
out
west
we
need
something
to
add
to
the
excitement
if
the
old
man
new
buggy
is
piled
in
a
heap
you
wish
you
had
cut
out
some
of
the
excitement
retorted
chip
all
right
splinter
we
wo
hang
him
there
at
all
that
old
cottonwood
down
by
the
creek
would
do
fine
it
curdle
her
blood
like
dutch
cheese
to
see
us
marching
him
down
there
and
she
ca
see
the
hay
sticking
out
of
his
sleeves
that
far
what
if
she
wants
to
hold
an
autopsy
bantered
chip
by
golly
we
stake
her
to
a
hay
knife
and
tell
her
to
go
after
him
cried
slim
suddenly
waking
up
to
the
situation
the
noon
train
slid
away
from
the
little
red
depot
at
dry
lake
and
curled
out
of
sight
around
a
hill
the
only
arrival
looked
expectantly
into
the
cheerless
waiting
room
gazed
after
the
train
which
seemed
the
last
link
between
her
and
civilization
and
walked
to
the
edge
of
the
platform
with
a
distinct
frown
upon
the
bit
of
forehead
visible
under
her
felt
hat
a
fat
young
man
threw
the
mail
sack
into
a
buggy
and
drove
leisurely
down
the
track
to
the
post
office
the
girl
watched
him
out
of
sight
and
sighed
disconsolately
all
about
her
stretched
the
rolling
grass
land
faintly
green
in
the
hollows
brownly
barren
on
the
hilltops
save
the
water
tank
and
depot
not
a
house
was
to
be
seen
and
the
silence
and
loneliness
oppressed
her
the
agent
was
dragging
some
boxes
off
the
platform
she
turned
and
walked
determinedly
up
to
him
and
the
agent
became
embarrassed
under
her
level
look
is
there
anyone
here
to
meet
me
she
demanded
quite
needlessly
i
am
miss
whitmore
and
my
brother
owns
a
ranch
somewhere
near
here
i
wrote
him
two
weeks
ago
that
i
was
coming
and
i
certainly
expected
him
to
meet
she
tucked
a
lock
of
brown
hair
under
her
hat
crown
and
looked
at
the
agent
reproachfully
as
if
he
were
to
blame
and
the
agent
feeling
suddenly
that
somehow
the
fault
was
his
blushed
guiltily
and
kicked
at
a
box
of
oranges
whitmore
rig
is
in
town
he
said
hastily
i
saw
his
man
at
dinner
the
train
was
reported
late
but
she
made
up
grasping
desperately
at
his
dignity
he
swallowed
an
abject
apology
and
retreated
into
the
office
miss
whitmore
followed
him
a
few
steps
thought
better
of
it
and
paced
the
platform
for
ten
minutes
at
the
end
of
which
the
flying
u
rig
whirled
up
in
a
cloud
of
dust
and
the
agent
hurried
out
to
help
with
the
two
trunks
and
the
mandolin
and
guitar
in
their
canvas
cases
the
creams
circled
fearsomely
up
to
the
platform
and
stood
quivering
with
eagerness
to
be
off
their
great
eyes
rolling
nervously
miss
whitmore
took
her
place
beside
chip
with
some
inward
trepidation
mingled
with
her
relief
when
they
were
quite
ready
and
the
reins
loosened
suggestively
pet
stood
upon
her
hind
feet
with
delight
and
polly
lunged
forward
precipitately
the
girl
caught
her
breath
and
chip
eyed
her
sharply
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
hoped
she
was
not
going
to
scream
he
detested
screaming
women
she
looked
young
to
be
a
doctor
he
decided
after
that
lightning
survey
he
hoped
to
goodness
she
was
of
the
sweet
young
thing
order
he
had
no
patience
with
that
sort
of
woman
truth
to
tell
he
had
no
patience
with
any
sort
of
woman
he
spoke
to
the
horses
authoritatively
and
they
obeyed
and
settled
to
a
long
swinging
trot
that
knew
no
weariness
and
the
girl
heart
returned
to
its
normal
action
two
miles
were
covered
in
swift
silence
then
miss
whitmore
brought
herself
to
think
of
the
present
and
realized
that
the
young
man
beside
her
had
not
opened
his
lips
except
to
speak
once
to
his
team
she
turned
her
head
and
regarded
him
curiously
and
chip
feeling
the
scrutiny
grew
inwardly
defiant
miss
whitmore
decided
after
a
close
inspection
that
she
rather
liked
his
looks
though
he
did
not
strike
her
as
a
very
amiable
young
man
perhaps
she
was
a
bit
tired
of
amiable
young
men
his
face
was
thin
and
refined
and
strong
the
strength
of
level
brows
straight
nose
and
square
chin
with
a
pair
of
paradoxical
lips
which
were
curved
and
womanish
in
their
sensitiveness
the
refinement
was
an
intangible
expression
which
belonged
to
no
particular
feature
but
pervaded
the
whole
face
as
to
his
eyes
she
was
left
to
speculate
upon
their
color
since
she
had
not
seen
them
but
she
reflected
that
many
a
girl
would
give
a
good
deal
to
own
his
lashes
of
a
sudden
he
turned
his
eyes
from
the
trail
and
met
her
look
squarely
if
he
meant
to
confuse
her
he
failed
for
she
only
smiled
and
said
to
herself
they
do
you
think
we
ought
to
introduce
ourselves
she
asked
composedly
when
she
was
quite
sure
the
eyes
were
not
brown
chip
tone
was
neutrally
polite
miss
whitmore
had
suspected
that
he
was
painfully
bashful
after
the
manner
of
country
young
men
she
now
decided
that
he
was
not
he
was
passively
antagonistic
of
course
you
know
that
i
della
whitmore
she
said
chip
carefully
brushed
a
fly
off
polly
flank
with
the
whip
i
took
it
for
granted
i
was
sent
to
meet
a
miss
whitmore
at
the
train
and
i
took
the
only
lady
in
you
took
the
right
one
but
i
not
i
have
the
faintest
idea
who
you
my
name
is
claude
bennett
and
i
happy
to
make
your
i
do
believe
it
you
do
look
happy
said
miss
whitmore
inwardly
amused
that
the
proper
thing
to
say
when
you
been
introduced
to
a
lady
remarked
chip
noncommittally
though
his
lips
twitched
at
the
corners
miss
whitmore
finding
no
ready
reply
to
this
truthful
statement
remarked
after
a
pause
that
it
was
windy
chip
agreed
that
it
was
and
conversation
languished
miss
whitmore
sighed
and
took
to
studying
the
landscape
which
had
become
a
succession
of
sharp
ridges
and
narrow
coulees
and
bleak
with
a
purplish
line
of
mountains
off
to
the
left
after
several
miles
she
spoke
what
is
that
animal
over
there
do
dogs
wander
over
this
wilderness
alone
chip
eyes
followed
her
pointing
finger
that
a
coyote
i
wish
i
could
get
a
shot
at
him
they
an
awful
pest
out
here
you
he
looked
longingly
at
the
rifle
under
his
feet
if
i
thought
you
could
hold
the
horses
a
minute
oh
i
ca
i
i
not
accustomed
to
horses
but
i
can
shoot
a
chip
gave
her
a
quick
measuring
glance
the
coyote
had
halted
and
was
squatting
upon
his
haunches
his
sharp
nose
pointed
inquisitively
toward
them
chip
slowed
the
creams
to
a
walk
raised
the
gun
and
laid
it
across
his
knees
threw
a
shell
into
position
and
adjusted
the
sight
here
you
can
try
if
you
like
he
said
whenever
you
ready
stop
you
had
better
stand
up
i
watch
that
you
do
fall
ready
whoa
pet
miss
whitmore
did
not
much
like
the
skepticism
in
his
tone
but
she
stood
up
took
quick
careful
aim
and
fired
pet
jumped
her
full
length
and
reared
but
chip
was
watching
for
some
such
performance
and
had
them
well
under
control
even
though
he
was
compelled
to
catch
miss
whitmore
from
lurching
backward
upon
her
baggage
behind
the
seat
which
would
have
been
bad
for
the
guitar
and
mandolin
if
not
for
the
young
woman
the
coyote
had
sprung
high
in
air
whirled
dizzily
and
darted
over
the
hill
you
hit
him
cried
chip
forgetting
his
prejudice
for
a
moment
he
turned
the
creams
from
the
road
filled
with
the
spirit
of
the
chase
miss
whitmore
will
long
remember
that
mad
dash
over
the
hilltops
and
into
the
hollows
in
which
she
could
only
cling
to
the
rifle
and
to
the
seat
as
best
she
might
and
hope
that
the
driver
knew
what
he
was
about
which
he
certainly
did
there
he
goes
sneaking
down
that
coulee
he
get
into
one
of
those
washouts
and
hide
if
we
do
head
him
off
i
drive
around
so
you
can
get
another
shot
at
him
cried
chip
he
headed
up
the
hill
again
until
the
coyote
crouching
low
was
fully
revealed
that
a
fine
shot
throw
another
shell
in
quick
you
better
kneel
on
the
seat
this
time
the
horses
know
what
coming
steady
polly
my
girl
miss
whitmore
glanced
down
the
hill
and
then
apprehensively
at
the
creams
who
were
clanking
their
bits
and
quivering
only
their
master
familiar
voice
and
firm
grip
on
the
reins
held
them
there
at
all
chip
saw
and
interpreted
the
glance
somewhat
contemptuously
oh
of
course
if
you
afraid
miss
whitmore
set
her
teeth
savagely
knelt
and
fired
cutting
the
sentence
short
in
his
teeth
and
forcing
his
undivided
attention
to
the
horses
which
showed
a
strong
inclination
to
bolt
i
think
i
got
him
that
time
said
she
nonchalantly
setting
her
hat
straight
though
chip
with
one
of
his
quick
glances
observed
that
she
was
rather
white
around
the
mouth
he
brought
the
horses
dexterously
into
the
road
and
quieted
them
are
you
going
to
get
my
coyote
she
ventured
to
ask
certainly
the
road
swings
back
down
that
same
coulee
and
pass
right
by
it
then
i
get
out
and
pick
him
up
while
you
hold
the
you
hold
those
horses
yourself
returned
miss
whitmore
with
considerable
spirit
i
much
rather
pick
up
the
coyote
thank
chip
said
nothing
to
this
whatever
he
may
have
thought
he
drove
up
to
the
coyote
with
much
coaxing
of
pet
and
polly
who
eyed
the
gray
object
askance
miss
whitmore
sprang
out
and
seized
the
animal
by
its
coarse
bushy
tail
gracious
he
heavy
she
exclaimed
after
one
tug
he
been
fattening
up
on
flying
u
calves
remarked
chip
his
foot
upon
the
brake
miss
whitmore
knelt
and
examined
the
cattle
thief
curiously
look
she
said
here
where
i
hit
him
the
first
time
the
bullet
took
a
diagonal
course
from
the
shoulder
back
to
the
other
side
it
must
have
gone
within
an
inch
of
his
heart
and
would
have
finished
him
in
a
short
time
without
that
other
shot
that
penetrated
his
brain
you
see
death
was
chip
had
taken
advantage
of
the
halt
to
roll
a
cigarette
holding
the
reins
tightly
between
his
knees
while
he
did
so
he
passed
the
loose
edge
of
the
paper
across
the
tip
of
his
tongue
eying
the
young
woman
curiously
the
while
you
seem
to
be
pretty
well
onto
your
job
he
remarked
dryly
i
ought
to
be
she
said
laughing
a
little
i
been
learning
the
trade
ever
since
i
was
yes
you
began
my
uncle
john
is
a
doctor
i
helped
him
in
the
office
till
he
got
me
into
the
medical
school
i
was
brought
up
in
an
atmosphere
of
antiseptics
and
learned
all
the
bones
in
uncle
john
the
skeleton
you
know
before
i
knew
all
my
she
dragged
the
coyote
close
to
the
wheel
let
me
get
hold
of
the
chip
carefully
pinched
out
the
blaze
of
his
match
and
threw
it
away
before
he
leaned
over
to
help
with
a
quick
lift
he
landed
the
animal
limp
and
bloody
squarely
upon
the
top
of
miss
whitmore
largest
trunk
the
pointed
nose
hung
down
the
side
the
white
fangs
exposed
in
a
sinister
grin
the
girl
gazed
upon
him
proudly
at
first
then
in
dismay
oh
he
dripping
blood
all
over
my
mandolin
case
and
i
just
know
it
wo
come
out
she
tugged
frantically
at
the
instrument
damned
spot
quoted
chip
in
a
sepulchral
tone
before
he
turned
to
assist
her
miss
whitmore
let
go
the
mandolin
and
stared
blankly
up
at
him
and
chip
offended
at
her
frank
surprise
that
he
should
quote
shakespeare
shut
his
lips
tightly
and
relapsed
into
silence
chapter
ii
over
the
hog
that
flying
u
ranch
volunteered
chip
as
they
turned
sharply
to
the
right
and
began
to
descend
a
long
grade
built
into
the
side
of
a
steep
rocky
bluff
below
them
lay
the
ranch
in
a
long
narrow
coulee
nearest
them
sprawled
the
house
low
white
and
roomy
with
broad
porches
and
wide
windows
further
down
the
coulee
at
the
base
of
a
gentle
slope
were
the
sheds
the
high
round
corrals
and
the
haystacks
great
board
gates
were
distributed
in
seemingly
useless
profusion
while
barbed
wire
fences
stretched
away
in
all
directions
a
small
creek
bordered
with
cottonwoods
and
scraggly
willows
wound
aimlessly
away
down
the
coulee
j
does
seem
to
have
much
method
remarked
miss
whitmore
after
a
critical
survey
what
are
all
those
log
cabins
scattered
down
the
hill
for
they
look
as
though
had
a
handful
that
he
did
want
and
just
threw
them
down
toward
the
stable
and
left
them
lying
where
they
happened
to
it
does
all
right
conceded
chip
they
the
bunk
house
where
us
fellows
sleep
and
the
mess
house
where
we
eat
and
then
come
the
blacksmith
shop
and
a
shack
we
keep
all
kinds
of
truck
in
and
what
in
the
world
a
chorus
of
shouts
and
shots
arose
from
below
a
scurrying
group
of
horsemen
burst
over
the
hill
behind
the
house
dashed
half
down
the
slope
and
surrounded
the
bunk
house
with
yells
chip
held
the
creams
to
a
walk
and
furtively
watched
his
companion
miss
whitmore
eyes
were
very
wide
open
plainly
she
was
astonished
beyond
measure
at
the
uproar
whether
she
was
also
frightened
chip
could
not
determine
the
menacing
yells
increased
in
volume
till
the
very
hills
seemed
to
cower
in
fear
miss
whitmore
gasped
when
a
limp
form
was
dragged
from
the
cabin
and
lifted
to
the
back
of
a
snorting
pony
they
got
a
rope
around
that
man
neck
she
breathed
in
a
horrified
half
whisper
are
they
going
to
hang
him
it
kinda
looks
that
way
from
here
said
chip
inwardly
ashamed
all
at
once
it
struck
him
as
mean
and
cowardly
to
frighten
a
lady
who
had
traveled
far
among
strangers
and
who
had
that
tired
droop
to
her
mouth
it
was
a
fair
game
it
was
cheating
only
for
his
promise
to
the
boys
he
would
have
told
her
the
truth
then
and
there
miss
whitmore
was
not
a
stupid
young
woman
his
very
indifference
told
her
all
that
she
needed
to
know
she
tore
her
eyes
from
the
confused
jumble
of
gesticulating
men
and
restive
steeds
to
look
sharply
at
chip
he
met
her
eyes
squarely
for
an
instant
and
the
horror
oozed
from
her
and
left
only
amused
chagrin
that
they
should
try
to
trick
her
so
hurry
up
she
commanded
so
i
can
be
in
at
the
death
remember
i
a
doctor
they
tying
him
to
his
horse
he
looks
half
dead
with
inwardly
she
added
he
overacts
the
part
the
little
cavalcade
in
the
coulee
fired
a
spectacular
volley
into
the
air
and
swept
down
the
slope
like
a
whirlwind
across
a
patch
of
alkali
ground
through
the
big
gate
and
up
the
road
past
the
stables
they
thundered
the
prisoner
bound
and
helpless
in
their
midst
then
something
happened
a
river
press
flapping
impotently
in
the
embrace
of
a
willow
caught
the
eye
of
banjo
a
little
blaze
faced
bay
who
bore
the
captive
he
squatted
ducked
backward
so
suddenly
that
his
reins
slipped
from
slim
fingers
and
lowered
his
head
between
his
white
front
feet
his
rider
seemed
stupid
beyond
any
that
banjo
had
ever
known
and
he
had
known
many
snorting
and
pitching
he
was
away
before
the
valiant
band
realized
what
was
happening
in
their
midst
the
prisoner
swayed
drunkenly
in
the
saddle
at
the
third
jump
his
hat
flew
off
disclosing
the
jagged
end
of
a
the
happy
family
groaned
as
one
man
and
gave
chase
banjo
with
almost
human
maliciousness
was
heading
up
the
road
straight
toward
chip
and
the
woman
doctor
and
she
must
be
a
poor
doctor
indeed
and
a
badly
frightened
one
withal
if
she
failed
to
observe
a
peculiarity
in
the
horse
thief
cranium
cal
emmett
dug
his
spurs
into
his
horse
and
shot
by
slim
like
a
locomotive
shouting
profanity
as
he
went
head
him
into
the
creek
yelled
happy
jack
and
leaned
low
over
the
neck
of
his
sorrel
weary
willie
stood
up
in
his
stirrups
and
fanned
glory
with
his
hat
yip
yee
go
to
it
banjo
old
boy
watch
his
nibs
ride
would
yuh
he
a
broncho
buster
from
away
weary
willie
was
the
only
man
of
them
all
who
appeared
to
find
any
enjoyment
in
the
situation
if
chip
only
had
the
sense
to
slow
up
and
give
us
a
chance
or
spill
that
old
maid
over
the
bank
groaned
jack
bates
and
plied
whip
and
spur
to
overtake
the
runaway
now
the
captive
was
riding
dizzily
head
downward
frightening
banjo
half
out
of
his
senses
what
he
had
started
as
a
grim
jest
he
now
continued
in
deadly
earnest
what
was
this
uncanny
semblance
of
a
which
he
could
not
unseat
yet
which
clung
so
precariously
to
the
saddle
he
had
no
thought
now
of
bucking
in
pure
devilment
he
was
galloping
madly
his
eyes
wild
and
staring
of
a
sudden
chip
saw
danger
lurking
beneath
the
fun
of
it
he
leaned
forward
a
little
got
a
fresh
grip
on
the
reins
and
took
the
whip
hang
tight
now
i
going
to
beat
that
horse
to
the
hog
miss
whitmore
laughing
till
the
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
braced
herself
mechanically
chip
had
been
laughing
also
but
that
was
before
banjo
struck
into
the
hill
road
in
his
wild
flight
from
the
terror
that
rode
in
the
saddle
a
smart
flick
of
the
whip
upon
their
glossy
backs
and
the
creams
sprang
forward
at
a
run
the
buggy
was
new
and
strong
and
if
they
kept
the
road
all
would
be
well
unless
they
met
banjo
upon
the
narrow
ridge
between
two
knolls
known
as
the
hog
back
another
tap
and
the
creams
ran
like
deer
one
wheel
struck
a
cobble
stone
and
the
buggy
lurched
horribly
stop
there
goes
my
coyote
cried
miss
whitmore
as
a
gray
object
slid
down
under
the
hind
wheel
hang
on
or
you
go
next
was
all
the
comfort
she
got
as
chip
braced
himself
for
the
struggle
before
him
the
hog
back
was
reached
but
banjo
was
pounding
up
the
hill
beyond
his
nostrils
red
and
flaring
his
sides
reeking
with
perspiration
behind
him
tore
the
flying
u
boys
in
a
vain
effort
to
head
him
back
into
the
coulee
before
mischief
was
done
chip
drew
his
breath
sharply
when
the
creams
swerved
out
upon
the
broad
hilltop
just
as
banjo
thundered
past
with
nothing
left
of
his
rider
but
the
legs
and
with
them
shorn
of
their
plumpness
as
the
hay
dribbled
out
upon
the
road
a
fresh
danger
straightway
forced
itself
upon
chip
consciousness
the
creams
maddened
by
the
excitement
were
running
away
he
held
them
sternly
to
the
road
and
left
the
stopping
of
them
to
providence
inwardly
thanking
the
lord
that
miss
whitmore
did
not
seem
to
be
the
screaming
kind
of
woman
the
vigilantes
drew
hastily
out
of
the
road
and
scudded
out
of
sight
down
a
gully
as
the
creams
lunged
down
the
steep
grade
and
across
the
shallow
creek
bed
fortunately
the
great
gate
by
the
stable
swung
wide
open
and
they
galloped
through
and
up
the
long
slope
to
the
house
coming
more
under
control
at
every
leap
till
by
a
supreme
effort
chip
brought
them
panting
to
a
stand
before
the
porch
where
the
old
man
stood
boiling
over
with
anxiety
and
excitement
james
whitmore
was
not
a
man
who
took
things
calmly
had
he
been
a
woman
he
would
have
been
called
fussy
what
in
what
was
you
making
a
race
track
out
of
the
grade
for
he
demanded
after
he
had
bestowed
a
hasty
kiss
beside
the
nose
of
his
sister
chip
dropped
a
heavy
trunk
upon
the
porch
and
reached
for
the
guitar
before
he
answered
i
was
just
trying
those
new
springs
on
the
it
was
very
exciting
commented
miss
whitmore
airily
i
shot
a
coyote
but
we
lost
it
coming
down
the
hill
your
men
were
playing
a
funny
game
hare
and
hounds
it
looked
like
or
were
they
breaking
a
new
horse
the
old
man
looked
at
chip
intelligence
dawning
in
his
face
there
was
something
back
of
it
all
he
knew
he
had
been
asleep
when
the
uproar
began
and
had
reached
the
door
only
in
time
to
see
the
creams
come
down
the
grade
like
a
daylight
shooting
star
i
guess
they
was
breaking
a
bronk
he
said
carelessly
you
got
enough
baggage
for
a
trip
round
the
world
dell
i
hope
it
ai
all
dope
for
us
poor
devils
tell
shorty
i
want
t
see
him
chip
took
the
reins
from
the
old
man
hands
sprang
in
and
drove
back
down
the
hill
to
the
stables
the
reception
committee
as
chip
sarcastically
christened
them
rounded
up
the
runaway
and
sneaked
back
to
the
ranch
by
the
coulee
trail
with
much
unseemly
language
they
stripped
the
saddle
and
a
flapping
pair
of
overalls
off
poor
disgraced
banjo
and
kicked
him
out
of
the
corral
that
the
way
jack
schemes
always
pan
out
grumbled
slim
by
golly
yuh
do
get
me
into
another
jackpot
like
that
you
might
explain
why
you
let
that
several
kinds
of
cayuse
get
away
from
you
retorted
jack
fretfully
if
you
been
onto
your
job
things
would
have
been
smooth
as
wonder
what
the
old
maid
thought
broke
in
weary
bent
on
preserving
peace
in
the
happy
family
i
bet
she
never
saw
us
at
all
laughed
cal
old
splinter
gave
her
all
she
wanted
to
do
hanging
to
the
rig
the
way
he
came
down
that
grade
was
slow
he
just
missed
running
into
banjo
on
the
hog
back
by
the
skin
of
the
teeth
if
he
had
it
be
doctor
and
chip
too
gee
that
was
a
close
shave
well
said
happy
jack
mournfully
if
we
do
all
get
the
bounce
for
this
i
miss
my
guess
it
a
little
the
worst
we
done
except
that
time
we
that
stray
steer
last
winter
amended
weary
chuckling
over
the
remembrance
as

fastened
the
big
gate
behind

that
was
another
of
jack

schemes
put
in
slim

and
let
him
take
after

mournful
conviction

how

whose
sunny
temper

glanced
at
them
and
went
on
cutting
the
leaves
of
a
late
magazine
which
he
had
purloined
from
the
dry
lake
barber
cal
emmett
strode
up
and
grabbed
the
limp
gray
hat
from
his
head
and
began
using
it
for
a
football

held

was
new
two
years
ago
explained
chip
making
an
ineffectual
grab
at
it
cal
threw
it
to
him
and
came
and
sat
down
upon
his
heels
to
peer
over
chip
arm
at
the
magazine
how
the
old
maid
doctor
asked
jack
bates
leaning
against
the
door
while
he
rolled
a
cigarette
scared
plum
to
death
i
left
the
remains
in
the
old
man
was
she
scared
honest
cal
left
off
studying
the
types
of
fair
what
did
she
say
when
we
broke
loose
jack
drew
a
match
sharply
along
a
log
nothing
well
yes
she
said
they
going
to
that
man
chip
voice
quavered
the
words
in
a
shrill
falsetto
the
deuce
she
did
jack
indulged
in
a
gratified
laugh
what
did
she
say
when
you
put
the
creams
under
the
whip
up
there
i
do
suppose
the
old
girl
is
wise
to
the
fact
that
you
saved
her
neck
right
then
but
you
sure
did
you
done
yourself
proud
cal
patted
chip
knee
approvingly
chip
blushed
under
the
praise
and
hastily
answered
the
question
she
hollered
out
there
goes
my
coyote
her
coyote
her
coyote
what
the
devil
was
she
doing
with
a
coyote
the
happy
family
stood
transfixed
and
chip
eyes
were
seen
to
laugh
her
coyote
did
any
of
you
fellows
happen
to
see
a
dead
coyote
up
on
the
grade
because
if
you
did
it
the
weary
willie
walked
deliberately
over
and
seized
chip
by
the
shoulders
bringing
him
to
his
feet
with
one
powerful
yank
do
you
try
throwing
any
loads
into
this
crowd
young
man
answer
me
yuh
how
did
that
old
maid
come
by
a
coyote
a
dead
one
chip
squirmed
loose
and
reached
for
his
cigarette
book
she
shot
it
he
said
calmly
but
with
twitching
lips
shot
it
five
voices
made
up
the
incredulous
echo
what
with
demanded
weary
when
he
got
his
breath
with
my
rifle
i
brought
it
out
from
town
today
bert
rogers
had
left
it
at
the
barber
shop
for
gee
whiz
and
them
creams
hating
a
gun
like
poison
she
did
shoot
from
the
rig
did
she
yes
said
chip
she
did
the
first
time
she
did
know
any
better
and
the
second
time
she
was
hot
at
me
for
hinting
she
was
scared
she
a
spunky
little
devil
all
right
she
busy
hating
me
right
now
for
running
the
grade
thinks
i
did
it
to
scare
her
i
guess
that
all
some
fool
women
she
a
howling
sport
then
groaned
cal
who
much
preferred
the
sweet
young
things
no
i
sized
her
up
as
a
what
does
she
look
like
how
old
is
she
i
never
asked
her
age
replied
chip
his
face
lighting
briefly
in
a
smile
as
to
her
looks
she
is
and
she
is
that
as
much
as
i
after
this
bald
lie
he
became
busy
with
his
cigarette
give
me
that
magazine
cal
i
did
finish
cutting
the
chapter
iii
silver
miss
della
whitmore
gazed
meditatively
down
the
hill
at
the
bunk
house
the
boys
were
all
at
work
she
knew
she
had
heard
tell
two
of
them
to
ride
the
sheep
coulee
fence
and
had
been
consumed
with
amazed
curiosity
at
the
order
wherefore
should
two
sturdy
young
men
be
commanded
to
ride
a
fence
when
there
were
horses
that
assuredly
needed
exercise
judging
by
their
antics
and
needed
it
badly
she
resolved
to
ask
at
the
first
opportunity
the
others
were
down
at
the
corrals
branding
a
few
calves
which
belonged
on
the
home
ranch
she
had
announced
her
intention
of
going
to
look
on
and
her
brother
knowing
how
the
boys
would
regard
her
presence
had
told
her
plainly
that
they
did
not
want
her
he
said
it
was
no
place
for
girls
anyway
then
he
had
put
on
a
very
dirty
pair
of
overalls
and
hurried
down
to
help
for
he
was
not
above
lending
a
hand
when
there
was
extra
work
to
be
done
miss
della
whitmore
tidied
the
kitchen
and
dusted
the
sitting
room
and
then
having
a
pair
of
mischievously
idle
hands
and
a
very
feminine
curiosity
conceived
an
irrepressible
desire
to
inspect
the
bunk
house
would
tell
her
that
also
was
no
place
for
girls
she
supposed
but
was
not
present
so
his
opinion
did
not
concern
her
she
had
been
at
the
flying
u
ranch
a
whole
week
and
was
beginning
to
feel
that
its
resources
for
entertainment
aside
from
the
masculine
contingent
which
held
some
promising
material
were
about
exhausted
she
had
climbed
the
bluffs
which
hemmed
the
coulee
on
either
side
had
selected
her
own
private
saddle
horse
a
little
sorrel
named
concho
and
had
made
friends
with
patsy
the
cook
she
had
dazzled
cal
emmett
with
her
wiles
and
had
found
occasion
to
show
chip
how
little
she
thought
of
him
a
highly
unsatisfactory
achievement
since
chip
calmly
her
whenever
common
politeness
permitted
him
there
yet
remained
the
unexplored
mystery
of
that
little
cabin
down
the
slope
from
which
sounded
so
much
boylike
laughter
of
an
evening
she
watched
and
waited
till
she
was
positive
the
coast
was
clear
then
clapped
an
old
hat
of
upon
her
head
and
ran
lightly
down
the
hill
with
her
hand
upon
the
knob
she
ran
her
eye
critically
along
the
outer
wall
and
decided
that
it
had
at
some
remote
date
been
treated
to
a
coat
of
whitewash
gave
the
knob
a
sudden
twist
with
a
backward
glance
like
a
child
stealing
cookies
stepped
in
and
came
near
falling
headlong
she
had
not
expected
that
remoteness
of
floor
common
to
cabins
built
on
a
side
hill
well
she
pulled
herself
together
and
looked
curiously
about
her
what
struck
her
at
first
was
the
total
absence
of
bunks
there
were
a
couple
of
plain
iron
bedsteads
and
two
wooden
ones
made
of
rough
planks
there
was
a
table
made
of
an
inverted
coffee
box
with
legs
of
and
littered
with
a
characteristic
collection
of
bachelor
trinkets
there
was
a
glass
lamp
with
a
badly
smoked
chimney
a
pack
of
cards
a
sack
of
smoking
tobacco
and
a
box
of
matches
there
was
a
tin
box
with
spools
of
very
coarse
thread
some
equally
coarse
needles
and
a
pair
of
scissors
there
was
also
and
miss
whitmore
gasped
when
she
saw
it
a
pile
of
magazines
with
the
latest
number
of
her
favorite
upon
the
top
she
went
closer
and
examined
them
and
glanced
around
the
room
with
doubting
eyes
there
were
spurs
quirts
chaps
and
bits
upon
the
walls
there
were
cigarette
stubs
and
burned
matches
innumerable
upon
the
rough
board
floor
and
here
in
her
hand
she
turned
the
pages
of
her
favorite
abstractedly
and
a
paper
fluttered
out
and
fell
face
upward
on
the
floor
she
stooped
and
recovered
it
glanced
and
gasped
well
it
was
only
a
pencil
sketch
done
on
cheap
unruled
tablet
paper
but
her
mind
dissolved
into
a
chaos
of
interrogation
marks
and
exclamation
points
with
the
latter
predominating
more
and
more
the
longer
she
looked
it
showed
hills
and
a
shallow
coulee
which
she
remembered
perfectly
in
the
foreground
a
young
woman
in
a
smart
tailored
costume
the
accuracy
of
which
was
something
amazing
stood
proudly
surveying
a
dead
coyote
at
her
feet
in
a
corner
of
the
picture
stood
a
stump
with
a
long
thin
splinter
beside
it
on
the
ground
underneath
was
written
in
characters
beautifully
symmetrical
the
old
maid
credential
there
was
no
gainsaying
the
likeness
even
the
rakish
tilt
of
the
jaunty
felt
hat
caused
by
the
wind
and
that
wild
dash
across
country
was
painstakingly
reproduced
and
the
fanciful
tucks
on
the
sleeve
of
the
gown
and
i
did
suppose
he
had
deigned
so
much
as
a
glance
was
her
first
coherent
thought
miss
whitmore
soul
burned
with
resentment
no
woman
even
at
loves
to
be
called
the
old
maid
especially
by
a
young
man
with
square
chin
and
lips
with
a
pronounced
curve
to
them
and
whoever
supposed
the
fellow
could
draw
like
that
and
notice
every
tiny
little
detail
without
really
looking
once
of
course
she
knew
her
hat
was
crooked
with
the
wind
blowing
one
head
off
almost
but
he
had
no
business
the
old
maid
credential
card
old
maid
indeed
the
audacity
of
him
beg
pardon
miss
whitmore
wheeled
quickly
her
heart
in
the
upper
part
of
her
throat
judging
by
the
feel
of
it
chip
himself
stood
just
inside
the
door
eying
her
coldly
i
was
not
speaking
said
miss
whitmore
haughtily
in
futile
denial
to
this
surprising
statement
chip
had
nothing
to
say
he
went
to
one
of
the
iron
beds
stooped
and
drew
out
a
bundle
which
had
miss
whitmore
asked
him
what
it
was
he
would
probably
have
called
his
war
she
did
not
ask
she
stood
and
watched
him
though
her
conscience
assured
her
it
was
a
dreadfully
rude
thing
to
do
and
that
her
place
was
up
at
the
house
miss
whitmore
was
frequently
at
odds
with
her
conscience
at
this
time
she
stood
her
ground
backed
by
her
pride
which
was
her
chiefest
ally
in
such
emergencies
when
he
drew
a
huge
revolver
from
its
scabbard
and
proceeded
calmly
to
insert
cartridge
after
cartridge
miss
whitmore
was
constrained
to
speech
are
you
going
to
shoot
something
the
question
struck
them
both
as
particularly
inane
in
view
of
his
actions
i
am
replied
he
without
looking
up
he
whirled
the
cylinder
into
place
pushed
the
bundle
back
under
the
bed
and
rose
polishing
the
barrel
of
the
gun
with
a
silk
handkerchief
miss
whitmore
hoped
he
was
going
to
murder
anyone
he
looked
keyed
up
to
almost
any
desperate
deed
who
what
are
you
going
to
shoot
really
the
question
asked
itself
chip
raised
his
eyes
for
a
fleeting
glance
which
took
in
the
pencil
sketch
in
her
hand
miss
whitmore
observed
that
his
eyes
were
much
darker
than
hazel
they
were
almost
black
and
there
was
strangely
enough
not
a
particle
of
curve
to
his
lips
they
were
thin
and
straight
and
stern
silver
he
broke
his
oh
there
was
real
horror
in
her
tone
miss
whitmore
knew
all
about
silver
from
garrulous
patsy
chip
had
rescued
a
pretty
brown
colt
from
starving
on
the
range
had
bought
him
of
the
owner
petted
and
cared
for
him
until
he
was
now
one
of
the
best
saddle
horses
on
the
ranch
he
was
a
dark
chestnut
with
beautiful
white
crinkly
mane
and
tail
and
white
feet
miss
whitmore
had
seen
chip
riding
him
down
the
coulee
trail
only
yesterday
and
now
her
heart
ached
with
the
pity
of
it
how
did
it
happen
i
do
know
he
was
in
the
little
pasture
got
kicked
chip
jerked
open
the
door
with
a
force
greatly
in
excess
of
the
need
of
it
miss
whitmore
started
impulsively
toward
him
her
eyes
were
not
quite
clear
do
not
yet
let
me
go
if
it
a
straight
break
i
can
set
the
bone
and
save
chip
savage
in
his
misery
regarded
her
over
one
square
shoulder
are
you
a
veterinary
surgeon
may
i
ask
miss
whitmore
felt
her
cheeks
grow
hot
but
she
stood
her
ground
i
am
not
but
a
broken
bone
is
a
broken
bone
whether
it
belongs
to
a
man
or
some
other
beast
y
chip
way
of
saying
yes
was
one
of
his
chief
weapons
of
annihilation
he
had
a
peculiar
taunting
inflection
which
he
could
give
to
it
upon
occasion
which
caused
prickles
of
flesh
upon
the
victim
to
say
that
miss
whitmore
was
not
utterly
quenched
argues
well
for
her
courage
she
only
gasped
as
though
treated
to
an
unexpected
dash
of
cold
water
and
went
on
i
sure
i
might
save
him
if
you
let
me
try
or
are
you
really
eager
to
shoot
him
chip
muscles
shrank
eager
to
shoot
him
silver
the
only
thing
that
loved
and
understood
him
you
may
come
and
look
at
him
if
you
like
he
said
after
a
breath
or
two
miss
whitmore
overlooked
the
tolerance
of
the
tone
and
stepped
to
his
side
mechanically
clutching
the
sketch
in
her
fingers
it
was
chip
looking
down
at
her
from
his
extra
foot
of
height
who
called
her
attention
to
it
are
you
thinking
of
using
that
for
a
plaster
miss
whitmore
started
and
blushed
then
with
an
uptilt
of
chin
if
i
need
a
strong
irritant
yes
she
calmly
rolled
the
paper
into
a
tiny
tube
and
thrust
it
into
the
front
of
her
pink
for
want
of
a
pocket
and
chip
watching
her
surreptitiously
felt
a
queer
grip
in
his
chest
which
he
thought
it
best
to
set
down
as
anger
silently
they
hurried
down
where
silver
lay
his
beautiful
gleaming
mane
brushing
the
tender
green
of
the
young
grass
blades
he
lifted
his
head
when
he
heard
chip
step
and
neighed
wistfully
chip
bent
over
him
black
agony
in
his
eyes
miss
whitmore
looking
on
realized
for
the
first
time
that
the
suffering
of
the
horse
was
a
mere
trifle
compared
to
that
of
his
master
her
eyes
wandered
to
the
loaded
revolver
which
bulged
his
pocket
behind
and
she
shuddered
but
not
for
silver
she
went
closer
and
laid
her
hand
upon
the
shimmery
mane
the
horse
snorted
nervously
and
struggled
to
rise
he
not
used
to
a
woman
said
chip
with
a
certain
accent
of
pride
i
guess
this
is
the
closest
he
ever
been
to
one
you
see
he
never
had
any
one
handle
him
but
then
he
certainly
is
no
lady
horse
said
miss
whitmore
somehow
in
the
last
moment
her
attitude
toward
chip
had
changed
considerably
try
and
make
him
let
me
feel
the
with
much
coaxing
and
soothing
words
it
was
accomplished
and
it
did
not
take
long
for
it
was
a
front
leg
broken
straight
across
just
above
the
fetlock
miss
whitmore
stood
up
and
smiled
into
the
young
eyes
conscious
of
a
desire
to
bring
the
curve
back
into
his
lips
it
very
simple
she
declared
cheerfully
i
know
i
can
cure
him
we
had
a
colt
at
home
with
his
leg
broken
the
same
way
and
he
was
entirely
cured
and
does
even
limp
of
course
she
added
honestly
uncle
john
doctored
him
but
i
chip
drew
the
back
of
his
gloved
hand
quickly
across
his
eyes
and
swallowed
miss
whitmore
if
you
could
save
old
silver
miss
whitmore
the
young
medical
graduate
blinked
rapidly
and
found
urgent
need
of
tucking
in
brown
locks
with
her
back
to
the
tall
who
had
unwittingly
dropped
his
mask
for
an
instant
she
took
off
old
hat
turned
it
clean
around
twice
and
put
it
back
exactly
as
it
was
before
unless
the
tilt
over
her
left
ear
was
a
trifle
more
pronounced
show
me
the
woman
who
can
set
a
hat
straight
upon
her
head
without
aid
of
a
mirror
we
must
get
him
up
from
there
and
into
a
box
stall
there
is
one
there
y
chip
hesitated
i
would
ask
the
old
your
brother
for
the
use
of
it
though
not
even
for
i
will
returned
she
promptly
i
never
feel
any
compunction
about
asking
for
what
i
want
if
i
ca
get
it
any
other
way
i
understand
why
you
wanted
to
shoot
you
must
have
known
this
bone
could
be
i
did
want
to
chip
bent
over
and
drove
a
fly
from
shoulder
when
a
horse
belonging
to
the
outfit
gets
crippled
like
that
he
makes
coyote
bait
a
ca
expect
any
better
for
his
own
he
get
better
whatever
he
may
expect
i
just
spoiling
for
something
to
practice
on
anyway
and
he
such
a
beauty
if
you
can
get
him
up
lead
him
to
the
stable
while
i
go
and
tell
and
get
some
one
to
she
started
away
whom
shall
i
get
she
called
back
weary
if
you
can
and
slim
a
good
hand
with
horses
slim
is
that
the
tall
lanky
man
no
he
the
short
fat
one
that
is
miss
whitmore
fixed
these
facts
firmly
in
her
memory
and
ran
swiftly
to
where
rose
all
the
dust
and
noise
from
the
further
corral
she
climbed
up
until
she
could
look
conveniently
over
the
top
rail
the
fence
seemed
to
her
dreadfully
high
a
clear
waste
of
straight
sturdy
poles
j
g
baw
came
answer
from
a
wholly
unexpected
source
as
a
big
red
cow
charged
and
struck
the
fence
under
her
feet
a
blow
which
nearly
dislodged
her
from
her
perch
the
cow
recoiled
a
few
steps
and
lowered
her
head
truculently
scat
shoo
there
go
on
away
you
horrid
old
thing
you
oh
g
weary
who
was
roping
had
just
dragged
a
calf
up
to
the
fire
and
was
making
a
loop
to
catch
another
when
the
cow
made
a
second
charge
at
the
fence
he
dashed
in
ahead
of
her
his
horse
narrowly
escaping
an
ugly
gash
from
her
long
wicked
horns
as
he
dodged
he
threw
his
rope
with
the
peculiar
twist
of
the
practiced
roper
catching
her
by
the
head
and
one
front
foot
straight
across
the
corral
he
shot
to
the
end
of
a
rope
tied
fast
to
the
saddle
horn
the
red
cow
flopped
with
a
thump
which
knocked
all
desire
for
trouble
out
of
her
for
the
time
shorty
slipped
the
rope
off
and
climbed
the
fence
but
the
cow
only
shook
her
aching
sides
and
limped
sullenly
away
to
the
far
side
of
the
corral
and
the
boys
had
shinned
up
the
fence
like
scared
cats
up
a
tree
when
the
trouble
began
and
perched
in
a
row
upon
the
top
the
old
man
looked
across
and
espied
his
sister
and
undignified
watching
the
outcome
dell
what
in
thunder
the
you
doing
on
that
fence
he
shouted
across
the
corral
what
in
thunder
are
you
doing
on
the
fence
she
flung
back
at
him
the
old
man
climbed
shamefacedly
down
followed
by
the
others
is
that
what
you
call
put
in
the
clear
asked
she
genially
i
see
now
it
means
clear
on
the
top
you
go
back
to
the
house
and
stay
there
commanded
wrathfully
the
boys
were
showing
unmistakable
symptoms
of
mirth
and
the
laugh
was
plainly
against
the
old
man
oh
no
came
her
voice
and
calm
shoo
that
cow
this
way
again
will
you
i
like
to
watch
shin
up
the
fence
it
good
for
him
it
makes
one
supple
and
actually
getting
hurry
along
with
that
calf
shouted
the
old
man
recovering
the
branding
iron
and
turning
his
back
on
his
tormentor
the
boys
beyond
grinning
furtively
at
one
another
behaved
with
quite
praiseworthy
gravity
miss
whitmore
watched
while
weary
dragged
a
spotted
calf
up
to
the
fire
and
the
boys
threw
it
to
the
ground
and
held
it
until
the
old
man
had
stamped
it
artistically
with
a
smoking
u
oh
ai
you
gone
yet
what
want
silver
broke
his
huh
i
knew
that
long
ago
chip
gone
to
shoot
him
you
go
on
to
the
house
doggone
it
you
have
every
cow
in
the
corral
on
the
fight
that
red
waist
of
yours
it
is
red

beautiful
rose

cows

either
going
to
shoot
that
horse
i
going
to
set
his
leg
and
cure
him
and
going
to
keep
him
in
one
of
your
box
stalls
there
now
cal
emmett
took
a
sudden
fit
of
coughing
and
leaned
his
forehead
weakly
against
a
rail
and
weary
got
into
some
unnecessary
argument
with
his
horse
and
bolted
across
to
the
gate
where
his
shoulders
were
seen
to
shake
possibly
with
a
nervous
chill
the
bravest
riders
are
sometimes
so
affected
nobody
laughed
however
indeed
slim
seemed
unusually
serious
even
for
him
while
happy
jack
looked
positively
in
pain
i
want
that
short
fat
man
to
help
slim
squirmed
at
this
blunt
identification
of
himself
and
weary
miss
whitmore
might
have
spoken
with
a
greater
effect
of
dignity
had
she
not
been
clinging
to
the
top
of
the
fence
with
two
dainty
slipper
toes
thrust
between
the
rails
not
so
very
far
below
under
the
circumstances
she
looked
like
a
pretty
spoiled
little
schoolgirl
oh
you
turned
horse
doctor
have
yuh
leaned
suddenly
upon
his
branding
iron
and
laughed
doggone
it
that
ai
a
bad
idea
got
two
box
stalls
and
there
an
old
gray
horse
in
the
pasture
the
same
old
gray
horse
that
come
out
uh
the
wilderness
with
a
bad
case
uh
i
have
some
uh
the
boys

him
up
and

start
a
horsepital

jokes
by
ear

while

last
week

a
please

here
sighed
miss
whitmore
plaintively
climbing
gingerly
down
chapter
iv
an
ideal
picture
i
guess
i
go
down
to
denson
said
at
the
breakfast
table
one
morning
maybe
we
can
get
that
grass
widow
to
come
and

do
want
any
old
grass
widow

long
as
patsy
bakes
the
bread
and
meat
and
cake
and
stuff
it
just
fun
to
keep
house
the
only
trouble
is
there
is
half
enough
to
keep
me
busy
i
going
to
get
a
license
to
practice
medicine
so
if
there
any
sickness
around
i
can
be
of
some
use
you
say
it
fifty
miles
to
the
nearest
doctor
but
that
make
a
grass
widow
necessary
i
can
keep
house
it
looks
better
than
when
i
came
and
you
know
which
remark
would
have
hurt
the
feelings
of
several
had
they
overheard
it
oh
i
ai
finding
fault
with
your
housekeeping
you
do
pretty
well
for
a
green
hand
but
patsy

to
go
with

it
starts
and
what
men
i
keep
on
the
ranch

have
to
eat
with
us
that
the
way
i
been
used
to
fixing
things
i
was
never
so
good
i
could
eat
at
the
same
table
with
my
men
if
they
was
fit
for
my
company
i
fired
and
got
fellows
that
was
i
had
this
bunch
a
good
long
while
now
you
can
do
all
right
with
just
me
but
you
cook
for
two
or
three
men
you
ca
cook
good
enough
even
if
it
too
much
had
a
blunt
way
of
stating
disagreeable
facts
occasionally
very
well
get
your
grass
widow
by
all
means
retorted
she
with
much
wasted
dignity
she
a
swell
cook
and
a
fine
housekeeper
and
shell
keep
yuh
from
getting
lonesome
she
good
company
the
countess
he
grinned
when
he
said
it
i

up
the
creams
and
you
get
ready
and
go
along
with
us
it
give
you
a
chance
to
size
up
the
kind
uh
neighbors
yuh
there
was
real
pleasure
in
driving
swiftly
over
the
prairie
land
through
the
sweet
spring
sunshine
and
miss
whitmore
tingled
with
enthusiasm
till
they
drove
headlong
into
a
deep
coulee
which
sheltered
the
denson
family
this
road
is
positively
dangerous
she
exclaimed
when
they
reached
a
particularly
steep
place
and
chip
threw
all
his
weight
upon
the
brake
we
get
the
countess
in
beside
yuh
coming
back
and
then
yuh
rattle
around
in
the
seat
so
much
she
good
and
solid
just
hang
onto
her
and
you
be
all
right
said
if
i
do
like
her
looks
and
i
know
i
wo
i
get
into
the
front
seat
and
you
can
hang
onto
her
yourself
chip
who
had
been
silent
till
now
glanced
briefly
over
his
shoulder
it
a
cinch
you
take
the
front
seat
he
remarked
laconically
j
if
you
hire
a
woman
like
that
like
what
doggone
it
it
takes
a
woman
to
jump
at
conclusions
the
countess
is
all
right
she
talks
some
i
tell
a
man
she
does
broke
in
chip
tersely
well
show
me
the
woman
that
do
do

bluffed
so
easy
dell
i
never

the
woman
yet
that
chip
had
any
time
for
the
countess
is
all
right
and
she
certainly
can
cook
i
admit
she
talks
chip
laughed
grimly
and
the
old
man
subsided
at
the
house
a
small
man
came
down
to
the
gate
to
greet
them
why
how
i
could
make
out
who
was
comin
but
mary
she
up
an
the

and
i
dunno
what
i
like

ye
take
a
look
at
it
fore
ye
go
i
expect
t
pay
the
old
man
winked
appreciatively
at
chip
before
he
came
humanely
to
the
rescue
and
explained
that
his
sister
was
not
a
horse
doctor
and
denson
looking
very
disappointed
reiterated
his
invitation
to
enter
denson
a
large
woman
who
narrowly
escaped
being
like
her
husband
beamed
upon
them
from
the
doorway
come
right
on
in
louise
here

awful
lonesome
comin
right

from
the
east
where

is
thick
do
lay
off
yer
things
della
looked
appealingly
at
who
again
came
to
the
rescue
somehow
he
made
himself
heard
long
enough
to
explain
their
errand
and
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
they
were
in
a
great
hurry
and
had
eaten
dinner
before
they
started
from
home
in
his
sister
opinion
he
made
one
exceedingly
rash
statement
he
said
that
he
wished
to
hire
sister
for
the
summer
denson
immediately
sent
a
shrill
call
for
louise
then
appeared
the
countess
tall
gaunt
and
muscular
with
sallow
skin
and
a
nervous
manner
the
front
seat
or
walk
declared
miss
whitmore
mentally
after
a
brief
scrutiny
and
began
storing
up
a
scathing
rebuke
for
louise
this
is
miss
whitmore
began
denson
cheerfully
fortified
by
a
fresh
lungful
of
air
they
after
yuh
t
go
keep

for
an
i
guess
yuh
better
go

somehow
now
the
most
louise
had
been
talking
also
but
her
sister
seemed
to
have
a
stronger
pair
of
lungs
for
her
voice
drowned
that
of
the
countess
who
retreated
to
pack
the
minutes
dragged
by
to
the
tune
of
several
chapters
of
family
history
as
voluminously
interpreted
by
denson
miss
whitmore
had
always
boasted
the
of
nerves
but
this
day
she
developed
a
genuine
case
of
once
she
saw
chip
face
turned
inquiringly
toward
the
window
and
telegraphed
her
state
of
mind
while
denson
back
was
turned
so
eloquently
that
chip
was
swept
at
once
into
sympathetic
he
arranged
the
cushion
on
the
front
seat
significantly
and
was
rewarded
by
an
emphatic
though
furtive
nod
and
smile
whereupon
he
leaned
comfortably
back
rolled
a
cigarette
and
smoked
contentedly
at
peace
with
himself
and
the
world
though
he
did
not
in
the
least
know
why
an
as
i
told
louise
folks
has
got
t
put
up
with
things
an
not
be
huntin
trouble
with
a
club
all
the
time
if
they
expect
t
git
any
comfort
out
uh
this

luck

t
me
but
we
always
git
along
somehow
an
we
ai
had
no
sickness
except
when
a
confused
uproar
arose
in
the
room
above
them
followed
immediately
by
a
humpety
bump
and
a
crash
as
a
small
pink
object
burst
open
a
door
and
rolled
precipitately
into
their
midst
it
proved
to
be
one
of
the
little
densons
who
kicked
feebly
with
both
feet
and
then
lay
still
mercy
upon
us
ellen
who
pushed
sary
down

she

up
and
lifted

the
quartet
snuffling
and
reluctant
was
dragged
ignominiously
to
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
there
confessed
tears
and
much
recrimination
that
they
had
been
peeping
down
at
the
through
various
in
the
chamber
floor
that
as
sary
was
next
the
wall
her
range
of
vision
was
restricted
to
the
thin
spot
upon
the
crown
of
head
and
the
back
of
his
neck

longed
for
sight
of
the
woman

and
when
she
essayed
to
crowd
in
and
usurp
ellen
point
of
vantage
there
ensued
a
war
of
extermination
which
ended
in
the
literal
downfall
of
sary
by
the
time
this
court
of
inquiry
adjourned
louise
appeared
and
said
she
believed
she
was
ready
and
miss
whitmore
escaped
from
the
house
far
in
advance
of
the
others
and
such
were
telepathic
powers
that
he
sprang
down
voluntarily
and
assisted
her
to
the
front
seat
without
a
word
being
said
by
either
followed
a
week
of
dullness
at
the
ranch
with
the
countess
scrubbing
and
dusting
and
cleaning
from
morning
till
night
the
little
doctor
as
the
bunk
house
had
christened
her
was
away
attending
the
state
medical
examination
at
helena
sighed
cal
on
sunday
afternoon
it
seems
mighty
queer
without
the
little
doctor
around
here
sassing
the
old
man
and
putting
the
hull
bunch
of
us
on
the
fence
about
once
a
day
if
it
was
for
len
adams
it
would
do
you
any
good
to
throw
a
nasty
loop
at
the
little
doctor
broke
in
weary
she
spoken
for
by
all
signs
and
tokens
there
some
fellow
back
east
got
a
long
rope
on
you
got
the
papers
for
that
jeered
cal
the
little
doctor
act
the
way
i
want
my
girl
t
act
supposin
i
was
some
thousand
or
fifteen
hundred
miles
off
her
range
she
ai
doing
no
pining
i
tell
yuh
she
doing
a
lot
of
writing
though
i
bet
money
if
we
called
the
roll
right
here
you
see
there
been
a
letter
a
week
hittin
the
trail
to
one
cecil
granthum
gilroy
that
what
agreed
jack
bates
i
packed
one
last
week
i
done
worse
than
that
said
weary
blandly
i
up
and
fired
a
shot
at
her
after
the
second
one
she
handed
me
i
says
as
innocent
if
i
lost
this
there
be
a
fellow
out
on
the
next
train
with
blood
in
his
eye
and
a
in
both
hands
demanding
explanations
and
she
flashed
them
dimples
on
me
and
twinkled
them
big
gray
eyes
of
hers
and
says
up
to
you
to
carry
it
safe
then
or
words
to
that
effect
i
took
notice
she
did
deny
but
what
he
two
doctors
in
one
family
gee
whiz
mused
cal
if
i
had
got
the
only
girl
god
ever
made
right
i
give
one
cecil
granthum
of
gilroy
ohio
a
run
for
his
money
i
tell
yuh
those
i
impress
it
upon
him
that
a
man
taking
long
chances
when
he
stands
and
lets
his
best
girl
stampede
out
here
among
us
for
a
change
uh
grass
that
fellow
needs
looking
after
he
ai
finished
his
education
jacky
you
ai
got
a
female
girl
yanking
your
heart
around
sail
in
and
show
us
what
yuh
can
do
in
that
nit
said
jack
bates
briefly
my
heart
doing
business
at
the
old
stand
and
doing
it
satisfactory
and
proper
i
do
want
to
set
it
to
bucking
over
a
girl
that
would
have
me
at
any
price
let
slim
the
little
doctor
half
stuck
on
him
while
the
boys
amused
themselves
in
serious
debate
with
slim
chip
put
away
his
magazine
and
went
down
to
visit
silver
in
the
box
stall
he
was
glad
they
had
not
attempted
to
draw
him
into
the
banter
they
had
never
once
thought
to
do
so
probably
though
he
had
been
thrown
into
the
company
of
the
little
doctor
more
than
any
of
the
others
for
several
good
reasons
he
had
broken
the
creams
to
harness
and
always
drove
them
for
the
old
man
found
them
more
than
he
cared
to
tackle
and
there
was
silver
with
frequent
discussions
over
his
progress
toward
recovery
and
some
argument
over
his
treatment
for
chip
had
certain
ideas
of
his
own
concerning
horses
and
was
not
backward
about
expressing
them
upon
occasion
that
the
little
doctor
should
write
frequent
letters
to
a
man
in
the
east
did
not
concern
him
why
should
it
still
a
fellow
without
a
home
and
without
some
woman
who
cares
for
him
can
not
escape
having
his
loneliness
thrust
upon
him
at
times
he
wondered
why
he
should
care
surely
ten
years
of
living
his
life
alone
ought
to
kill
that
latent
homesickness
which
used
to
hold
him
awake
at
nights
sometimes
even
of
late
years
when
he
stood
guard
over
the
cattle
at
night
and
got
to
thinking
oh
it
was
hell
to
be
all
alone
in
the
world
there
were
cal
and
weary
they
had
girls
who
loved
them
and
they
were
sure
welcome
to
them
and
jack
bates
and
happy
jack
had
sisters
and
mothers
and
even
slim
had
an
old
maid
aunt
who
always
knit
him
a
red
and
green
pair
of
wristlets
for
christmas
chip
smoothing
mechanically
the
shimmery
white
mane
of
his
pet
thought
he
might
be
contented
if
he
had
even
an
old
maid
aunt
but
he
would
see
that
she
made
his
wristlets
of
some
other
color
than
those
bestowed
every
year
upon
slim
as
for
the
little
doctor
it
would
be
something
strange
if
she
had
gone
through
life
without
having
some
fellow
in
love
with
her
probably
if
the
truth
was
known
there
had
been
more
than
cecil
granthum
bah
what
a
sickening
name
cecil
it
might
as
well
be
adolphus
or
regie
or
what
does
a
man
want
to
pack
around
a
name
like
that
for
probably
he
was
the
kind
of
man
that
the
name
sounded
like
a
dude
with
pink
cheeks
chip
knew
just
how
he
looked
inspiration
suddenly
seizing
upon
him
he
sat
down
upon
the
manger
drew
his
memorandum
book
out
of
his
inner
coat
pocket
carefully
sharpened
a
bit
of
lead
pencil
which
he
found
in
another
pocket
tore
a
leaf
from
the
book
and
with
silver
looking
over
his
shoulder
drew
a
graphic
ideal
picture
of
cecil
granthum
chapter
in
silver
stall
oh
are
you
here
it
a
wonder
you
do
have
your
bed
brought
down
here
so
you
can
sleep
near
silver
how
has
he
been
doing
since
i
left
chip
simply
sat
still
upon
the
edge
of
the
manger
and
stared
his
gray
hat
was
pushed
far
back
upon
his
head
and
his
dark
hair
waved
and
curled
upon
his
forehead
very
much
as
a
girl
might
have
done
he
did
not
know
that
he
was
a
very
young
man
but
perhaps
the
little
doctor
did
she
smiled
and
came
up
and
patted
silver
who
had
forgotten
that
he
ever
had
objected
to
her
nearness
he
nickered
a
soft
welcome
and
laid
his
nose
on
her
shoulder
you
been
drawing
a
picture
who
the
victim
of
your
satirical
pencil
this
time
the
little
doctor
reaching
out
quickly
calmly
appropriated
the
sketch
before
chip
had
time
to
withdraw
it
even
if
he
had
cared
to
do
so
he
was
busy
wondering
how
the
little
doctor
came
to
be
there
at
that
particular
time
and
had
forgotten
the
picture
which
he
had
not
quite
finished
labeling
dr
cecil
miss
whitmore
turned
red
at
first
then
broke
into
laughter
oh
h
ha
ha
ha
silver
you
do
know
how
funny
this
master
of
yours
can
be
ha
ha
she
raised
her
head
from
silver
neck
where
it
had
rested
and
wiped
her
eyes
how
did
you
know
about
cecil
she
demanded
of
a
very
discomfited
young
man
upon
the
manger
i
did
know
and
i
did
want
to
know
i
heard
the
boys
talking
and
joshing
about
him
and
i
just
drew
their
own
chip
grinned
a
little
and
whittled
at
his
pencil
and
wondered
how
much
of
the
statement
was
a
lie
miss
whitmore
tamed
red
again
and
ended
by
laughing
even
more
heartily
than
at
first
their
conclusions
are
very
complimentary
she
said
i
believe
cecil
would
feel
flattered
at
this
why
those
bowed
legs
may
i
ask
and
wherefore
that
long
lean
dyspeptic
visage
cecil
let
me
inform
you
has
a
digestion
that
quails
not
at
deviled
crabs
and
horrors
at
midnight
as
i
have
abundant
reason
to
know
i
have
seen
cecil
prepare
a
welsh
rabbit
and
eat
it
also
with
much
relish
apparently
oh
no
their
conclusions
were
quite
correct
there
are
other
details
i
might
mention
that
cane
for
instance
but
let
it
pass
i
shall
keep
this
i
think
as
a
companion
to
old
maid
credential
card
are
you
in
the
habit
of
keeping
other
folk
property
inquired
chip
with
some
acerbity
nothing
but
personal
caricatures
and
hearts
perhaps
returned
the
little
doctor
sweetly
i
hardly
think
your
collection
of
the
last
named
article
is
very
large
retorted
chip
still
i
added
to
the
collection
pursued
miss
whitmore
calmly
i
shared
my
seat
in
the
train
with
silent
partner
i
did
not
find
him
silent
however
duncan
whitaker
he
hired
a
team
in
dry
lake
and
we
came
out
together
and
i
believe
please
mention
cecil
granthum
to
him
will
you
chip
wished
quite
savagely
that
she
would
let
those
dimples
dodge
into
her
cheeks
and
the
laugh
dodge
into
her
eyes
like
that
it
made
a
fellow
uncomfortable
he
was
thoroughly
disgusted
with
her
or
he
would
be
if
she
would
only
stop
looking
like
that
he
was
in
that
state
of
mind
where
his
only
salvation
seemingly
lay
in
quarreling
with
some
one
immediately
so
old
dunk
come
back
if
you
got
his
heart
you
must
have
gone
hunting
it
with
a
microscope
for
it
a
mighty
small
one
almost
as
small
as
his
soul
no
one
else
even
knew
he
had
one
you
ought
to
have
it
set
in
a
ring
so
you
wo
lose
i
do
wear
phony
jewelry
thank
you
said
miss
whitmore
and
chip
thought
dimples
were
so
bad
after
all
the
little
doctor
was
weaving
silver
mane
about
her
white
fingers
and
meditating
deeply
chip
wondered
if
she
were
thinking
of
cecil
where
did
you
learn
to
draw
like
that
she
asked
suddenly
turning
toward
him
you
do
much
better
than
i
and
i
always
been
learning
from
good
teachers
did
you
ever
try
painting
chip
blushed
and
looked
away
from
her
this
was
treading
close
to
his
inner
self
i
do
know
where
i
learned
i
never
took
a
lesson
in
my
life
except
from
watching
people
and
horses
and
the
country
and
remembering
the
lines
they
made
you
know
i
always
made
pictures
ever
since
i
can
remember
but
i
never
tried
colors
very
much
i
never
had
a
chance
working
around
and
on
i
like
to
have
you
look
over
some
of
my
sketches
and
things
and
paints
and
canvas
if
you
ever
care
to
try
that
come
up
to
the
house
some
evening
and
i
show
you
my
daubs
they
none
of
them
as
good
as
old
maid
i
wish
you
tear
that
thing
up
said
chip
vehemently
why
the
likeness
is
perfect
one
would
think
you
were
designer
for
a
fashion
paper
the
way
you
got
the
tucks
in
my
sleeve
and
the
braid
on
my
collar
and
you
might
have
had
the
kindness
to
tell
me
my
hat
was
on
crooked
i
think
there
was
a
rustle
in
the
loose
straw
a
distant
slam
of
the
stable
door
and
chip
sat
alone
with
his
horse
whittling
abstractedly
at
his
pencil
till
his
knife
blade
grated
upon
the
metal
which
held
the
eraser
chapter
vi
the
hum
of
preparation
miss
whitmore
ran
down
to
the
blacksmith
shop
waving
an
paper
in
her
hand
i
got
it
got
what
smallpox
did
not
even
look
up
from
the
iron
he
was
welding

my
license

jack

man
gave
the
bellows
a
pull
which
sent
a
shower
of
sparks
toward
the
really
truly
doctor
brought
the
license
she
explained
patiently
you
can
see
for
yourself
they
were
awfully
nice
to
me
they
seemed
to
think
a
girl
doctor
is
some
kind
of
joke
out
here
they
did
make
it
any
easier
though
they
acted
as
if
they
did
expect
me
to
pass
but
i
did
the
old
man
rubbed
one
smutty
hand
down
his
trousers

and
extended
it
for
the
precious
document

a
look

his
pride
in

to
her
knees
and
dipped

handful
of
amber
soap
from

the
little
doctor
gurgled
this
was
a
malady
which
had
not
been
mentioned
at
the
medical
college
where
shall
we
set
the
tables
if
we
dance
in
the
dining
room
she
asked
having
heard
enough
of
the
beckmans
for
the
present
why
we
wo
set
any
tables
folks
always
have
a
lap
supper
at

a

and
take
the
plates
on
their
laps
and
yuh
pass
stuff

beautiful
bread
interrupted
the
little
doctor
very
sincerely
well
i
ai
had
the
best
uh
luck
lately
but
i
guess
it
does
taste
good
after
that
bread
yuh

no
name
for
patsy
made
that
bread

sniffed
the
countess
contemptuously
as
i
told

when
i
come
i
wonder
how
many
cakes

need
miss
whitmore
you
will
observe
had
learned
to
interrupt
when
she
had
anything
to
say
it
was
the
only
course
to
pursue
with
anyone
from
denson
coulee
the
countess
having
finished
her
scrubbing
rose
jerkily
and
upset
the
soap
can
which
rolled
over
and
over
down
the
steps
leaving
a
yellow
trail
as
it
went
well
there
if
that
was
a
bright
trick
uh
mine
they

the
more

the

naively
the
little
doctor

behind
her
handkerchief
my
stars
alive
i

cried
the
countess
and
ran
to

a
list
of

wedge
of
feathery
delight

foot
the
the
old
man
thinking
to
go
back
to

work
stepped
into
the
puddle
of
soft
soap
and
sat
emphatically
down
upon
the
top
step
coasting
rapidly
to
the
bottom
a
carpet
slipper
shot
through
the
open
door
and
landed
in
the
dishpan
the
other
slipper
disappeared
mysteriously
the
wedge
of
cake
was
immediately
pounced
upon
by
an
investigative
hen
and
carried
in
triumph
to
her
brood

painfully
to

with
the
aid
of
a
large
splinter
to
scrape
the
offending
soap
from
his
trousers
certainly

bachelors

della

but
gitting
married
there
ai
any
cure
for
that
chapter
vii
love
and
a
stomach
pump
an
electrical
undercurrent
of
expectation
pervaded
the
very
atmosphere
of
flying
u
ranch
the
musicians
two
supercilious
but
undeniably
efficient
young
men
from
great
falls
had
arrived
two
hours
before
and
were
being
graciously
entertained
by
the
little
doctor
up
at
the
house
the
sandwiches
stood
waiting
the
coffee
was
ready
for
the
boiling
water
and
the
floor
was
smooth
as
wax
could
make
it
for
some
reason
unknown
to
himself
chip
was
in
the
he
even
threatened
to
stop
in
the
bunk
house
and
said
he
did
feel
like
dancing
but
was
brought
into
line
by
weight
of
numbers
he
hated
dick
brown
anyway
for
his
cute
little
yellow
mustache
that
curled
up
at
the
ends
like
the
tail
of
a
drake
he
had
snubbed
him
all
the
way
out
from
town
and
handled
dick
guitar
with
a
recklessness
that
invited
disaster
and
the
way
dick
smirked
when
the
old
man
introduced
him
to
the
little
doctor
a
girl
with
a
fellow
in
the
east
ought
to
let
her
eyes
smile
that
way
at
a
little
dude
like
dick
brown
anyway
and
he
chip
had
given
her
a
letter
postmarked
blatantly
gilroy
ohio
and
she
had
been
so
taken
up
with
those
cussed
musicians
that
she
could
even
thank
him
and
only
just
glanced
at
the
letter
before
she
stuck
it
inside
her
belt
probably
she
even
read
it
till
after
the
dance
he
wondered
if
cecil
granthum
cared
oh
hell
of
course
he
cared
that
is
if
he
had
any
sense
at
all
but
the
little
doctor
she
was
above
flirting
he
noticed
if
he
ever
fell
in
love
with
a
girl
which
the
lord
forbid
he
take
mighty
good
care
she
did
get
time
to
make
dimples
and
smiles
for
some
other
fellow
to
go
to
heaven
looking
at
there
that
was
her
laughing
like
she
always
laughed
it
reminded
him
of
pines
nodding
in
a
canyon
and
looking
wise
and
whispering
things
they
seen
and
heard
before
you
were
born
and
of
water
falling
over
rocks
somehow
queer
maybe
but
it
did
he
wondered
if
dick
brown
had
been
trying
to
say
something
funny
he
did
see
for
the
life
of
him
how
the
little
doctor
could
laugh
at
that
little
imitation
man
girls
are
well
they
easy
pleased
most
of
them
down
in
the
bunk
house
the
boys
were
hurrying
into
their
war
togs
which
is
being
interpreted
their
best
clothes
there
was
a
nervous
scramble
over
the
cracked
piece
of
a
bar
mirror
which
had
a
history
and
cries
of
get
out

me
there
a
minute
ca
yuh
and
get
up

painfully
frequent

jack

blindly
with
a
refractory
red
tie
which
his
face
rivaled
in
hue
and
sheen
for
he
had
been
generous
of
soap
weary
had
possessed
himself
of
the
glass
and
was
shaving
as
leisurely
as
though
four
restive
were
not
waiting
anxiously

turn
for
the
lord

upon

nobody

gaudy
countenance

got
on
and
his
necktie
most
as
he
stropped
his
razor
with
exasperating
nicety
stopping
now
and
then
to
test
its
edge
upon
a
hair
from
his
own
brown
head
happy
jack
grown
desperate
over
his
tie
and
purple
over
remarks
craned
his
neck
over
the
shoulder
of
that
gentleman
and
leered
into
the
mirror
when
happy
liked
he
could
contort
his
naturally
plain
features
into
a
diabolical
grin
which
sent
prickly
waves
creeping
along
the
spine
of
the
beholder
weary

stared
half
rose
from
his
chair
holy
smithereens

you
look
like
the
devil
by
happy
watching
seized
the
hand
that
held
the
razor
cal
like
a
cat
pounced
upon
the
mirror
and
jack
bates
deftly
wrenched
the
razor
from
weary
fingers
whoopee
boys
some
of
you
tie
weary
down
and
set
on
him
while
i
shave
cried
cal
jubilant
over
the
mutiny
we
make
short
work
of
this
toilet
whereupon
weary
was
borne
to
the
floor
bound
hand
and
foot
with
silk
handkerchiefs
carried
bodily
and
laid
upon
his
bed
oh
the
things

he
asserted
darkly
there
wo
nary
a
uh

a
dance
from
my
little
you
see
he
grinned
prophetically
closed
his
eyes
and
murmured
call
me
early
mother
dear
and
straightway
fell
away
into
slumber
and
peaceful
snoring
while
the
lather
dried
upon
his
face
better
turn
weary
loose
and
wake
him
up
chip
suggested
jack
bates
half
an
hour
later
shoving
the
stopper
into
his
cologne
bottle
and
making
for
the
door
at
the
rate
the
rigs
are
rolling
in
it
take
us
all
to
put
up
the
the
door
slammed
behind
him
as
it
had
done
behind
the
others
as
they
hurried
away
here
chip
untied
weary
hands
and
feet
and
took
him
by
the
shoulder
wake
up
willie
if
you
want
to
be
queen
o
the
weary
sat
up
and
rubbed
his
eyes
confound
them
two
jacks
what
time
is
it
a
little
after
eight
your
crowd
has
come
yet
so
you

not
going
up
yet
for
a
while
you
off
your

up
and
take
all

going
my
weary
prepared
to
finish
his
interrupted
beautification
i
going
to
all
the
bottles
that
is
if
that
dry
lake
gang
comes
loaded
down
with
whisky
like
they
generally
do
we
ought
to
get
hold
of
it
and
cache
every
drop
weary
turned
clear
around
to
stare
his
astonishment
when
did
the
get
you
by
the
collar
he
demanded
aw
do
be
a
fool
weary
retorted
chip
you
can
see
it
look
right
for
us
to
let
any
of
the
boys
get
full
or
even
half
shot
seeing
this
is
the
little
doctor
weary
meditatively
scraped
his
left
jaw
and
wiped
the
lather
from
the
razor
upon
a
fragment
of
newspaper
splinter
we
throwed
in
together
ever
since
we
drifted
onto
the
same
range
and
i
with
you
uh
course
but
do
overlook
cecil
granthum
i
hate
like
the
devil
to
see
you
git
throwed
down
because
it
hurt
you
worse
than
anybody
i
chip
calmly
sifted
some
tobacco
into
a
cigarette
paper
his
mouth
was
very
straight
and
his
brows
very
close
together
it
a
devilish
good
thing
it
was
you
said
that
weary
if
it
had
been
anyone
else
i
punch
his
face
for
why
yes
an
i
help
you
weary
his
mouth
very
much
on
one
side
of
his
face
that
he
might
the
easier
shave
the
other
spoke
in
fragments
you
do
take
it
amiss
from
me
though
i
can
see
the
door
slammed
with
extreme
violence
and
weary
slashed
his
chin
unbecomingly
in
consequence
but
he
felt
no
resentment
toward
chip
he
calmly
stuck
a
bit
of
paper
on
the
cut
to
stop
the
bleeding
and
continued
to
shave
a
short
time
after
the
little
doctor
came
across
chip
glaring
at
dick
brown
who
was
strumming
his
guitar
with
ostentatious
ease
upon
an
inverted
box
at
one
end
of
the
long
dining
room
i
came
to
ask
a
favor
of
you
she
said
but
my
courage
oozed
at
the
first
it
hard
to
believe
your
courage
would
ooze
at
anything
what
the
favor
the
little
doctor
bent
her
head
and
lowered
her
voice
to
a
confidential
undertone
which
caught
at
chip
blood
and
set
it
leaping
i
want
you
to
come
and
help
me
turn
my
drug
store
around
with
its
face
to
the
wall
all
the
later
editions
of
denson
pilgreen
and
beckman
have
taken
possession
of
my
office
and
as
the
countess
says
beckman
kids
is
holy
terrors
an
it
savin
the
rod
an
spoilin
the
kid
that
makes
so
chip
laughed
outright
the
denson
kids
are
a
heap
worse
if
she
only
knew
it
he
said
and
followed
her
willingly
the
little
doctor
office
was
a
homey
little
room
with
a
couch
a
morris
rocker
two
willow
chairs
and
a
small
table
for
the
not

were
marched
silently
through

around

through

and
so
into

out
there
and

again
there
yuh
are
doctor
sail
upheld
mentally
by
the
unfailing
sunniness
of
weary
and
the
calm
determination
of
chip
to
whom
flying
heels
and
squirming
bodies
were
as
nothing
or
at
most
a
mere
trifle
the
little
doctor
set
to
work
with
a
thoroughness
and
dispatch
which
struck
terror
to
the
hearts
of
the
guilty
seven
it
did
not
take
long
as
weary
had
said
it
was
very
much
like
branding
calves
no
sooner
was
one
child
made
to
disgorge
and
laid
limp
and
subdued
upon
the
bed
than
chip
and
weary
seized
another
dexterously
by
heels
and
head
the
countess
did
nothing
beyond
guarding
the
door
and
acting
as
chaperon
to
the
undaunted
little
doctor
but
she
did
her
duty
and
held
her
tongue
afterward
which
was
a
great
deal
for
her
to
do
the
little
doctor
sat
down
in
a
chair
when
it
was
all
over
looking
rather
white
chip
moved
nearer
though
there
was
really
nothing
that
he
could
do
beyond
handing
her
a
glass
of
water
which
she
accepted
gratefully
weary
held
a
little
paper
trough
of
tobacco
in
his
fingers
and
drew
the
tobacco
sack
shut
with
his
teeth
his
eyes
were
fixed
reflectively
upon
the
bed
he
placed
the
sack
absently
in
his
pocket
still
meditating
other
things
she
answered
are
seven
he
quoted
softly
and
solemnly
and
the
little
doctor
forgot
her
faintness
in
a
hearty
laugh
you
two
go
back
to
your
dancing
now
she
commanded
letting
the
dimples
stand
in
her
cheeks
in
a
way
that
chip
dreamed
about
afterward
i
do
know
what
i
should
have
done
without
you
a
seems
born
to
meet
emergencies
in
just
the
right
way
please
do
tell
anyone
will
you
never
do
you
worry
about
us
doctor
chip
and
i
do
set
up
nights
emptying
our
brains
out
our
mouths
we
do
tell
our
secrets
to
nobody
but
our
horses
and
they
dead
you
need
think
i
tell
either
said
the
countess
earnestly
i
ai
forgot
how
you
took
the
blame
uh
that
sof
soap
dell
as
the
sayin
is
weary
closed
the
door
then
so
they
did
not
hear
the
saying
which
seemed
to
apply
to
this
particular
case
his
arm
hooked
into
chip
he
led
the
way
through
the
kitchen
and
down
the
hill
to
the
hay
corral
once
safe
from
observation
he
threw
himself
into
the
sweetly
pungent
and
laughed
and
laughed
chip
nervous
system
did
not
demand
the
relief
of
cachinnation
he
went
away
to
silver
stall
and
groped
blindly
to
the
place
where
two
luminous
green
moons
shone
upon
him
in
the
darkness
he
rubbed
the
delicate
nose
gently
and
tangled
his
fingers
in
the
dimly
gleaming
mane
as
he
had
seen
her
do
such
pink
little
fingers
they
were
he
laid
his
brown
cheek
against
the
place
where
he
remembered
them
to
have
rested
silver
horse
he
whispered
if
i
ever
fall
in
love
with
a
girl
which
is
likely
i
want
her
to
have
dimples
and
big
gray
eyes
and
a
laugh
like
chapter
viii
prescriptions
it
was
sunday
the
second
day
after
the
dance
the
boys
were
scattered
for
the
day
was
delicious
one
of
those
sweet
soft
days
which
come
to
us
early
in
may
down
in
the
blacksmith
shop
chip
was
putting
new
rowels
into
his
spurs
and
whistling
softly
to
himself
while
he
worked
the
little
doctor
had
gone
with
him
to
visit
silver
that
morning
and
had
not
hurried
away
but
had
leaned
against
the
manger
and
listened
while
he
told
her
of
the
time
silver
swimming
the
river
when
it
was
up
had
followed
him
to
the
shonkin
camp
when
chip
had
thought
to
leave
him
at
home
and
they
had
laughed
together
over
the
juvenile
seven
and
the
subsequent
indignation
of
the
mothers
who
with
the
exception
of
mary
had
bundled
up
their
offspring
and
gone
home
mad
true
they
had
none
of
them
thoroughly
understood
the
situation
having
only
the
version
of
the
children
who
accused
the
little
doctor
of
trying
to
make
them
eat
rubber
just
cause
she
was
mad
about
some
little
old
the
mystification
of
the
others
among
the
happy
family
who
scented
a
secret
with
a
joke
to
it
but
despaired
of
wringing
the
truth
from
either
weary
or
chip
was
dwelt
upon
with
much
enjoyment
by
the
little
doctor
it
was
a
good
old
world
and
a
pleasant
and
chip
had
no
present
quarrel
with
fate
or
with
anybody
else
that
was
why
he
whistled
then
voices
reached
him
through
the
open
door
and
a
laugh
her
laugh
chip
smiled
sympathetically
though
he
had
not
the
faintest
notion
of
the
cause
of
her
mirth
as
the
voices
drew
nearer
the
soft
smooth
hated
tones
of
dunk
whitaker
untangled
from
the
little
doctor
laugh
and
chip
stopped
whistling
dunk
was
making
a
good
long
stay
of
it
this
time
usually
he
came
one
day
and
went
the
next
and
no
one
grieved
at
his
departure
you
find
them
an
entirely
new
species
of
course
how
do
you
get
on
with
them
said
dunk
and
the
little
doctor
answered
him
frankly
and
distinctly
oh
very
well
considering
all
things
they
furnish
me
with
some
amusement
and
i
give
them
something
quite
new
to
talk
about
so
we
are
quits
they
are
a
lot
you
know
but
so
ignorant
i
do
suppose
the
words
trailed
into
an
indistinct
murmur
punctuated
by
jarring
cackle
chip
did
not
resume
his
whistling
though
he
might
have
done
so
if
he
had
heard
a
little
more
or
a
little
less
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
the
densons
and
the
pilgreens
and
the
beckmans
that
were
under
discussion
and
not
the
flying
u
cowboys
as
chip
believed
he
no
longer
smiled
sympathetically
we
furnish
her
with
some
amusement
do
we
that
good
we
a
lot
but
so
ignorant
the
devil
we
are
he
struck
the
rivet
such
a
blow
that
he
snapped
one
shank
of
his
spur
short
off
this
meant
ten
or
twelve
dollars
for
a
new
pair
though
the
cost
of
it
troubled
him
little
just
then
it
was
something
tangible
upon
which
to
pour
profanity
however
and
the
atmosphere
grew
sulphurous
in
the
vicinity
of
the
blacksmith
shop
and
remained
so
for
several
minutes
after
which
a
tall
irate
with
his
hat
pulled
low
over
angry
eyes
left
the
shop
and
strode
up
the
path
to
the
deserted
bunk
house
he
did
not
emerge
till
the
old
man
called
to
him
to
ride
down
to
benson
after
one
of
the
flying
u
horses
which
had
broken
out
of
the
pasture
della
was
looking
from
the
window
when
chip
rode
up
the
hill
upon
the
coulee
trail
which
passed
close
by
the
house
she
was
tired
of
the
platitudes
of
dunk
who
trying
to
be
both
original
and
polished
fell
far
short
of
being
either
and
only
succeeded
in
being
extremely
tiresome
where
chip
going
she
demanded
in
a
proprietary
tone
down
t
benson
after
a
spoke
lazily
without
taking
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
oh
i
wish
i
could
go
i
wonder
if
he
the
little
doctor
spoke
impulsively
as
was
her
habit
he
would
hey
chip
hold
on
a
minute
the
old
man
stood
waving
his
pipe
in
the
doorway
chip
jerked
his
horse
to
a
and
half
turned
in
the
saddle
what
dell
wants
t
go
along
will
yuh
saddle
up
concho
for
there
no
hurry
anyhow
you
got
plenty
uh
time
dell
afraid
one
uh
the
kids
might
fall
downstairs
and
she
miss
the
i
not
either
said
the
little
doctor
coming
to
stand
by
her
brother
it
too
nice
a
day
to
stay
inside
and
my
muscles
ache
for
a
gallop
over
the
chip
did
not
look
up
at
her
he
did
not
dare
he
felt
that
if
he
met
her
eyes
with
the
laugh
in
them
he
should
do
one
of
two
undesirable
things
he
should
either
smile
back
at
her
weakly
overlooking
the
hypocrisy
of
her
friendliness
or
sneer
in
answer
to
her
smile
which
would
be
very
rude
and
ungentlemanly
if
you
had
mentioned
wanting
a
ride
i
should
have
been
glad
to
accompany
you
remarked
dunk
reproachfully
when
chip
had
ridden
somewhat
sullenly
back
to
the
stable
i
did
think
of
it
before
thank
you
said
the
little
doctor
lightly
and
hurried
away
to
put
on
her
blue
riding
habit
with
its
cunning
little
jockey
cap
which
she
found
the
only
headgear
that
would
stay
upon
her
head
in
the
teeth
of
montana
wind
and
which
made
her
kissable
she
was
standing
on
the
porch
drawing
on
her
gauntlets
when
chip
returned
leading
concho
by
the
bridle
let
me
help
you
begged
dunk
at
her
elbow
hoping
till
the
last
that
she
would
invite
him
to
go
with
them
the
little
doctor
not
averse
to
hiding
the
bitter
of
her
medicine
under
a
coating
of
sugar
smiled
sweetly
upon
him
to
the
delectation
of
dunk
and
the
added
bitterness
of
chip
who
was
rapidly
nearing
that
state
of
mind
which
is
locally
described
as
being
strictly
on
the
i
expect
she
thinks
i
amuse
her
some
more
he
thought
savagely
as
they
galloped
away
through
the
quivering
sunlight
for
the
first
two
miles
the
road
was
level
and
chip
set
the
pace
which
was
as
he
intended
it
should
be
too
swift
for
much
speech
after
that
the
trail
climbed
abruptly
out
of
flying
u
coulee
and
the
horses
were
compelled
to
walk
then
it
was
that
chip
native
chivalry
and
were
put
to
test
he
was
hungry
for
a
solitary
ride
such
as
had
before
now
drawn
much
of
the
lonely
ache
out
of
his
heart
and
keyed
him
up
to
the
life
which
he
must
live
and
which
chafed
his
spirit
more
than
even
he
realized
instead
of
such
slender
comfort
he
was
forced
to
ride
beside
the
girl
who
had
hurt
him
so
close
that
his
knee
sometimes
brushed
her
horse
and
to
listen
to
her
friendly
chatter
and
make
answer
at
times
with
at
least
some
show
of
civility
she
was
talking
reminiscently
of
the
dance
j
showed
splendid
judgment
in
his
choice
of
musicians
did
he
chip
looked
straight
ahead
this
was
touching
a
sore
place
in
his
memory
a
vision
of
dick
brown
vapid
smile
and
curled
up
mustache
rose
before
him
i
tell
a
man
he
said
with
faint
irony
the
little
doctor
gave
him
a
quick
surprised
look
and
went
on
i
liked
their
playing
so
much
brown
was
especially
good
upon
the
y
yes
of
course
you
know
yourself
he
plays
are
expected
to
know
all
these
chip
hated
himself
for
replying
so
but
the
temptation
mastered
him
are
they
i
ca
see
why
chip
closed
his
lips
tightly
to
keep
in
something
impolite
the
little
doctor
puzzled
as
well
as
piqued
went
straight
to
the
point
why
did
you
like
brown
playing
did
i
say
i
did
like
it
well
you
not
exactly
but
you
implied
that
you
did
y
the
little
doctor
gave
the
reins
an
impatient
twitch
yes
yes
yes
no
answer
from
chip
he
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
that
was
not
more
or
less
profane
i
think
he
a
very
nice
amiable
young
man
strong
emphasis
upon
the
second
adjective
i
like
amiable
young
silence
he
going
to
come
down
here
hunting
next
fall
invited
yes
what
does
he
expect
to
find
why
whatever
there
is
to
hunt
chickens
and
er
deer
by
this
they
reached
the
level
and
the
horses
broke
of
their
own
accord
into
a
gallop
which
somewhat
relieved
the
strain
upon
the
mental
atmosphere
at
the
next
hill
the
little
doctor
looked
her
companion
over
critically
mr
bennett
you
look
positively
bilious
shall
i
prescribe
for
you
i
ca
see
how
that
would
add
to
your
i
not
trying
to
add
to
my
no
if
i
were
there
no
material
at
hand
young
men
are
never
amusing
to
me
i
like
amiable
young
men
such
as
dick
i
think
you
need
a
change
of
air
yes
i
felt
lately
that
eastern
airs
do
agree
with
my
miss
whitmore
grew
red
as
to
cheeks
and
bright
as
to
eyes
i
think
a
few
small
doses
of
eastern
manners
would
improve
you
very
much
she
said
pointedly
y
they
have
to
be
small
because
the
supply
is
very
the
little
doctor
grew
white
around
the
mouth
she
held
concho
rein
so
tight
he
almost
stopped
if
you
did
want
me
to
come
why
in
the
world
did
you
have
the
courage
to
say
so
at
the
start
i
must
say
i
do
admire
people
whose
tempers
and
manners
are
so
unstable
i
sorry
i
forced
my
presence
upon
you
and
i
promise
you
it
wo
occur
she
hesitated
and
then
fired
a
parting
shot
which
certainly
was
spiteful
in
the
extreme
there
one
good
thing
about
it
she
smiled
tartly
i
shall
have
something
interesting
to
write
to
with
that
she
turned
astonished
concho
short
around
in
the
trail
and
as
chip
gave
blazes
a
vicious
jab
with
his
spurs
at
the
same
instant
the
distance
between
them
widened
rapidly
as
chip
raced
away
over
the
prairie
he
discovered
a
new
and
puzzling
kink
in
his
temper
he
had
been
angry
with
the
little
doctor
for
coming
but
it
was
nothing
to
the
rage
he
felt
when
she
turned
back
he
did
not
own
to
himself
that
he
wanted
her
beside
him
to
taunt
and
to
hurt
with
his
rudeness
but
it
was
a
fact
for
all
that
and
it
was
a
very
surly
young
man
who
rode
into
the
denson
corral
and
threw
a
loop
over
the
head
of
the
runaway
chapter
ix
before
the
the
little
doctor
wants

come

where
the
boys
were

and
packing
their
belongings

to
start
with
the
wagon

the
morning
jack
bates
hurriedly
stuffed
a
miscellaneous
collection
of
socks
and
handkerchiefs
into
his
war
bag
and
made

asserted
jack
bates
grabbing
his
hat

made
a
few
hasty
passes
at
his
hair
and
said
he
was

when

and
get
t
pouring
our
incense
and

on
the

took
the

and
emptied
his
lungs
of

you

he
bent
again
to
his
eternal
drawing
the
dickens
you
ai
weary
was
too
astounded
to
say
more
chip
said
nothing
his
gray
shielded
his
face
from
view
save
for
the
thin
curved
lips
and
firm
chin
weary
studied
chin
and
lips
curiously
and
whatever
he
read
there
he
refrained
from
further
argument
he
knew
chip
so
much
better
than
did
anyone
else
aw
what
the
matter
with
yuh
splinter

cried
cal
from
the
doorway
i
guess
you
let
a
fellow
do
as
he
likes
about
it
wo
you
queried
chip
without
looking
up
he
was
very
busy
just
then
shading
the
shoulders
of
a
horse
so
that
one
might
see
the
tense
muscles
what
the
matter
you
and
the
little
doctor
have
a
falling
out
not
very
bad
chip
tone
was
open
to
several
interpretations
cal
interpreted
it
as
a
denial
sick
he
asked
next
yes
said
chip
shortly
and
falsely
we
call
the
doctor
in
then
volunteered
jack
bates
i
do
think
you
will
when
i
sick
enough
for
that
i
let
you
know
i
going
to
aw
come
on
and
let
him
alone
chip
able
t
take
care
of
himself
i
guess
said
weary
mercifully
holding
open
the
door
they
trooped
out
and
the
last
heard
of
them
was
cal
remarking
gee
whiz
i
have
t
be
ready
t
croak
before
i
miss
this
chance
uh
dealing
old
dunk
chip
sat
where
they
had
left
him
staring
unseeingly
down
at
the
uncompleted
sketch
his
cigarette
went
out
but
he
did
not
roll
a
fresh
one
and
held
the
stub
abstractedly
between
his
lips
set
in
bitter
lines
why
should
he
care
what
a
slip
of
a
girl
thought
of
him
he
care
he
only
that
thought
he
did
not
follow
to
the
end
but
started
immediately
on
a
new
one
he
supposed
he
was
ignorant
according
to
eastern
standards
lined
up
alongside
cecil
granthum
damn
him
he
would
cut
a
sorry
figure
no
doubt
he
had
never
seen
the
outside
of
a
college
let
alone
imbibing
learning
within
one
he
had
learned
some
of
the
wisdom
which
nature
teaches
those
who
can
read
her
language
and
he
had
read
much
lying
on
his
stomach
under
a
summer
sky
while
the
cattle
grazed
all
around
him
and
his
horse
cropped
the
sweet
grasses
within
reach
of
his
hand
he
could
repeat
whole
pages
of
shakespeare
and
of
scott
and
bobbie
burns
he
like
to
try
cecil
on
some
of
them
and
see
who
came
out
ahead
still
he
was
ignorant
and
none
realized
it
more
keenly
and
bitterly
than
did
chip
he
rested
his
chin
in
his
hand
and
brooded
over
his
comfortless
past
and
cheerless
future
he
could
just
remember
his
mother
and
he
preferred
not
to
remember
his
father
who
was
less
kind
to
him
than
were
strangers
that
was
his
past
and
the
future
always
to
be
a
there
was
his
knack
for
drawing
if
he
could
study
and
practice
perhaps
even
the
little
doctor
would
not
dare
call
him
ignorant
then
not
that
he
cared
for
what
she
might
say
or
might
not
say
but
a
fellow
ca
help
hating
to
be
reminded
of
something
that
he
knows
better
than
anyone
else
and
that
is
not
pleasant
however
you
may
try
to
cover
up
the
unsightliness
of
it
if
cecil
granthum
damn
him
had
been
kicked
into
the
world
and
made
to
fight
fate
with
tender
childish
little
fists
but
lately
outgrown
their
baby
dimples
as
had
been
his
lot
would
he
have
amounted
to
anything
either
maybe
cecil
would
have
grown
up
just
common
and
ignorant
and
fit
for
nothing
better
than
to
furnish
amusement
to
girl
doctors
with
dimples
and
big
gray
eyes
and
a
way
of
laughing
he
like
to
show
that
little
woman
that
she
did
know
all
about
him
yet
it
was
too
late
he
was
only
he
would
study
and
work
and
climb
to
where
she
must
look
up
not
down
to
him
if
she
cared
enough
to
look
at
all
it
was
too
late
he
would
quit
gambling
and
save
his
money
and
by
next
winter
he
have
enough
to
go
somewhere
and
learn
to
make
pictures
that
amounted
to
something
he
show
her
after
reiterating
this
resolve
in
several
emphatic
forms
chip
spirits
grew
perceptibly
lighter
so
much
so
that
he
rolled
a
fresh
cigarette
and
finished
the
drawing
in
his
hands
which
demonstrated
the
manner
in
which
a
particularly
snaky
broncho
had
taken
a
fall
out
of
jack
bates
in
the
corral
that
morning
next
day
early
in
the
afternoon
the
climbed
the
grade
and
started
on
its
long
trip
over
the
range
and
after
they
had
gone
the
ranch
seemed
very
quiet
and
very
lonely
to
the
little
doctor
who
revenged
herself
by
snubbing
dunk
so
unmercifully
that
he
announced
his
intention
of
taking
the
next
train
for
butte
where
he
lived
in
the
luxury
of
rich
bachelorhood
as
the
little
doctor
showed
no
symptoms
of
repenting
he
rode
sullenly
away
to
dry
lake
and
she
employed
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
writing
a
full
and
decidedly
prejudiced
account
to
cecil
of
her
quarrel
with
chip
whom
she
said
she
quite
hated
chapter
x
what
whizzer
did
i
guess
happy
lost
some
of
his
horses
las
night
said
slim
at
the
breakfast
table
next
morning
slim
had
been
kept
at
the
ranch
to
look
after
the
fences
and
the
ditches
and
was
doing
full
justice
to
the
expert
cookery
of
the
countess
what
makes
yuh
think
that
the
old
man
poised
a
bit
of
tender
broiled
steak
upon
the
end
of
his
fork
they
a
bunch
hangin
around
the
upper
fence
an
whizzer
among
i
know
that
snake
ten
miles
the
little
doctor
looked
up
quickly
she
had
never
before
heard
of
a
snake
but
then
she
had
not
yet
made
the
acquaintance
of
whizzer
well
maybe
you
better
run
into
the
corral
and
hold
till
shorty
sends
some
one
after
suggested
the
old
man
i
never
c
run
in
alone
not
with
whizzer
in
the
bunch
objected
slim
he
the
orneriest
cayuse
in
chouteau
whizzer
make
a
rattlin
good
saddle
horse
some
day
when
he
broke
gentle
argued
the
old
man
huh
i
do
envy
chip
the
job
uh
breakin
him
though
grunted
slim
as
he
went
out
of
the
door
after
breakfast
the
little
doctor
visited
silver
and
fed
him
his
customary
ration
of
lump
sugar
helped
the
countess
tidy
the
house
and
then
found
herself
at
a
loss
for
something
to
do
she
stood
looking
out
into
the
hazy
sunlight
which
lay
warm
on
hill
and
coulee
i
think
i
go
up
above
the
grade
and
make
a
sketch
of
the
ranch
she
said
to
the
countess
and
hastily
collected
her
materials
down
by
the
creek
a
sprang
out
of
her
way
and
kicked
itself
out
of
sight
beneath
a
bowlder
the
little
doctor
stood
and
watched
till
he
disappeared
before
going
on
again
further
up
the
bluff
a
striped
snake
gave
her
a
shivery
surprise
before
he
glided
sinuously
away
under
a
sagebush
she
crossed
the
grade
and
climbed
the
steep
bluff
beyond
searching
for
a
comfortable
place
to
work
a
little
higher
she
took
possession
of
a
great
gray
bowlder
jutting
like
a
giant
table
from
the
gravelly
soil
she
walked
out
upon
it
and
looked
down
a
sheer
drop
of
ten
or
twelve
feet
to
the
barren
yellow
slope
below
i
suppose
it
is
perfectly
solid
she
soliloquized
and
stamped
one
stout
little
boot
to
see
if
the
rock
would
tremble
if
human
emotions
are
possible
to
a
heart
of
stone
the
rock
must
have
been
greatly
amused
at
the
test
it
stood
firm
as
the
hills
around
it
della
sat
down
and
looked
below
at
the
house
a
doll
house
at
the
toy
corrals
and
tiny
sheds
and
stables
slim
walking
down
the
hill
was
a
mere
pigmy
a
short
waddling
insect
at
least
to
a
girl
unused
to
gazing
from
a
height
each
object
seemed
absurdly
small
flying
u
coulee
stretched
away
to
the
west
with
a
silver
ribbon
drawn
carelessly
through
it
with
many
a
twist
and
loop
fringed
with
a
tender
green
of
young
leaves
away
and
beyond
stood
the
bear
paws
hazily
blue
with
splotches
of
purple
shadows
i
do
blame
for
loving
this
place
thought
the
little
doctor
drinking
in
the
intoxication
of
the
west
with
every
breath
she
drew
she
had
just
become
absorbed
in
her
work
when
a
clatter
arose
from
the
grade
below
and
a
dozen
horses
headed
by
a
tall
rangy
sorrel
she
surmised
was
whizzer
dashed
down
the
hill
weary
and
chip
galloped
close
behind
they
did
not
look
up
and
so
passed
without
seeing
her
they
were
talking
and
laughing
in
very
good
spirits
which
the
little
doctor
resented
for
some
inexplicable
reason
she
heard
them
call
to
slim
to
open
the
corral
gate
and
saw
slim
run
to
do
their
bidding
she
forgot
her
sketching
and
watched
whizzer
dodge
and
bolt
back
and
chip
tear
through
the
creek
bed
after
him
at
peril
of
life
and
limb
back
and
forth
round
and
round
went
whizzer
running
almost
through
the
corral
gate
then
swerving
suddenly
and
evading
his
pursuers
with
an
ease
which
bordered
closely
on
the
marvelous
slim
saddled
a
horse
and
joined
in
the
chase
and
the
old
man
climbed
upon
the
fence
and
shouted
advice
which
no
one
heard
and
would
not
have
heeded
if
they
had
as
the
chase
grew
in
earnestness
and
excitement
the
sympathies
of
the
little
doctor
were
given
unreservedly
to
whizzer
whenever
a
particularly
clever
maneuver
of
his
set
the
men
to
swearing
she
clapped
her
hands
in
sincere
though
unheard
and
unappreciated
applause
good
boy
she
cried
approvingly
when
he
dodged
chip
and
whirled
through
the
big
gate
which
the
old
man
had
unwittingly
left
open
leaned
perilously
forward
and
shook
his
fist
unavailingly
whizzer
tossed
head
and
heels
alternately
and
scurried
up
the
path
to
the
very
door
of
the
kitchen
where
he
swung
round
and
looked
back
down
the
hill
snorting
triumph
shoo
there
shrilled
the
countess
shaking
her
dish
towel
at
him
who
snorted
he
disdainfully
and
trotted
leisurely
round
the
corner
chip
galloped
up
the
hill
his
horse
running
heavily
after
him
came
weary
liberally
applying
quirt
and
mild
invective
at
the
house
they
parted
and
headed
the
fugitive
toward
the
stables
he
shot
through
the
big
gate
lifting
his
heels
viciously
at
the
old
man
as
he
passed
whirled
around
the
stable
and
trotted
haughtily
past
slim
into
the
corral
of
his
own
accord
quite
as
if
he
had
meant
to
do
so
all
along
did
you
ever
exclaimed
the
little
doctor
disgustedly
from
her
perch
whizzer
i
ashamed
of
you
i
would
have
given
in
like
that
but
you
gave
them
a
chase
did
you
my
beauty
the
boys
flung
themselves
off
their
tired
horses
and
went
up
to
the
house
to
beg
the
countess
for
a
lunch
and
della
turned
resolutely
to
her
sketching
again
she
was
just
beginning
to
forget
that
the
world
held
aught
but
soft
shadows
mellow
glow
and
hazy
perspective
when
a
subdued
uproar
reached
her
from
below
she
drew
an
uncertain
line
or
two
frowned
and
laid
her
pencil
resignedly
in
her
lap
it
of
no
use
i
ca
do
a
thing
till
those
take
themselves
and
their
bronchos
off
the
ranch
and
may
it
be
soon
she
told
herself
disconsolately
and
not
oversincerely
the
best
of
us
are
not
above
trying
to
pull
the
wool
over
our
own
eyes
at
times
in
reality
their
brief
presence
made
the
near
future
seem
very
flat
and
insipid
to
the
little
doctor
it
was
washing
all
the
color
out
of
the
picture
and
leaving
it
a
dirty
gray
she
gazed
moodily
down
at
the
whirl
of
dust
in
the
corral
where
whizzer
was
struggling
to
free
himself
from
the
loop
chip
had
thrown
with
his
accustomed
calm
precision
whatever
chip
did
he
did
thoroughly
with
no
slurring
of
detail
whizzer
was
fain
to
own
himself
fairly
caught
oh
he
got
you
fast
my
beauty
sighed
the
little
doctor
woefully
why
did
you
jump
over
the
fence
i
think
you
could
and
run
run
to
freedom
she
grew
quite
melodramatic
over
the
humiliation
of
the
horse
she
had
chosen
to
champion
and
glared
resentfully
when
chip
threw
his
saddle
with
no
gentle
hand
upon
the
sleek
back
and
tightened
the
cinches
with
a
few
strong
relentless
yanks
chip
you
an
ugly
that
right
whizzer
kick
him
if
you
can
i
stand
by
you
this
assertion
you
understand
was
purely
figurative
the
little
doctor
would
have
hesitated
long
before
attempting
to
carry
it
out
literally
now
whizzer
when
he
tries
to
ride
you
do
you
let
him
throw
him
stable
so
there
perhaps
whizzer
understood
the
command
in
some
mysterious
telepathic
manner
at
any
rate
he
set
himself
straightway
to
obey
it
and
there
was
not
a
shadow
of
doubt
but
that
he
did
his
best
but
chip
did
not
choose
to
go
over
the
stable
instead
of
doing
so
he
remained
in
the
saddle
and
changed
ends
with
his
quirt
to
the
intense
rage
of
the
little
doctor
who
nearly
cried
oh
you
brute
you
fiend
i
never
speak
to
you
again
as
long
as
i
live
oh
whizzer
you
poor
fellow
why
do
you
let
him
abuse
you
so
why
do
you
throw
him
clean
off
the
ranch
this
is
exactly
what
whizzer
was
trying
his
best
to
do
and
best
was
exceedingly
bad
for
his
rider
as
a
general
thing
but
chip
calmly
refused
to
be
thrown
and
whizzer
who
was
no
fool
suddenly
changed
his
tactics
and
became
so
meek
that
his
champion
on
the
bluff
felt
tempted
to
despise
him
for
such
servile
submission
to
a
tyrant
in
brown
chaps
and
gray
hat
i
am
transcribing
the
facts
according
to
the
little
doctor
interpretation
she
watched
gloomily
while
whizzer
in
whose
brain
lurked
no
thought
of
submission
galloped
steadily
along
behind
the
bunch
which
slim
made
haste
to
liberate
and
bided
his
time
she
had
expected
better
rather
worse
of
him
than
that
she
had
not
dreamed
he
would
surrender
so
tamely
as
they
crossed
the
hog
back
and
climbed
the
steep
grade
just
below
her
she
eyed
him
reproachfully
and
said
again
whizzer
i
ashamed
of
you
it
did
certainly
seem
that
whizzer
heard
and
felt
the
pricking
of
pride
at
the
reproof
he
made
a
feint
at
being
frightened
by
a
jack
rabbit
which
sprang
out
from
the
shade
of
a
rock
and
bounced
down
the
hill
like
a
rubber
ball
as
if
whizzer
had
never
seen
a
jack
rabbit
before
he
who
had
been
born
and
reared
upon
the
range
among
them
it
was
a
feeble
excuse
at
the
best
but
he
made
the
most
of
it
and
lost
no
time
seeking
a
better
he
stopped
short
sidled
against
weary
horse
and
snorted
chip
in
none
the
best
humor
with
him
jerked
the
reins
savagely
and
dug
him
with
his
spurs
and
whizzer
resenting
the
affront
whirled
and
bounded
high
in
the
air
back
down
the
grade
he
bucked
with
the
high
rocking
crooked
jumps
which
none
but
a
western
cayuse
can
make
while
weary
turned
in
his
saddle
and
watched
with
breaths
there
was
nothing
else
that
he
could
do
chip
was
by
no
means
passive
for
every
jump
that
whizzer
made
the
rawhide
quirt
landed
across
his
flaring
nostrils
and
the
locked
rowels
of
chip
spurs
raked
the
sorrel
sides
from
cinch
to
flank
leaving
crimson
streams
behind
them
wild
with
rage
at
this
clinging
whom
he
could
not
dislodge
who
stung
his
sides
and
head
like
the
hornets
in
the
meadow
whizzer
gathered
himself
for
a
mighty
leap
as
he
reached
the
hog
back
like
a
wire
spring
released
he
shot
into
the
air
shook
himself
in
one
last
desperate
hope
of
victory
and
failing
came
down
with
not
a
joint
in
his
legs
and
turned
a
somersault
a
moment
and
he
struggled
to
his
feet
and
limped
painfully
away
crushed
and
beaten
in
spirit
chip
did
not
struggle
he
lay
a
long
length
of
brown
chaps
shirt
and
gray
hat
just
where
he
had
fallen
the
little
doctor
never
could
remember
getting
down
that
bluff
and
her
sketching
materials
went
to
amuse
the
jack
rabbits
and
the
birds
fast
as
she
flew
weary
was
before
her
and
had
raised
chip
head
upon
one
arm
she
knelt
beside
him
in
the
dust
hovering
over
the
white
face
and
still
form
like
a
pitying
little
gray
angel
weary
looked
at
her
impersonally
but
neither
of
them
spoke
in
those
first
breathless
moments
the
old
man
who
had
witnessed
the
accident
came
puffing
laboriously
up
the
hill
taking
the
short
cut
straight
across
from
the
stable
is
he
dead
he
yelled
while
he
scrambled
weary
turned
his
head
long
enough
to
look
down
at
him
with
the
same
impersonal
gaze
he
had
bestowed
upon
the
little
doctor
but
he
did
not
answer
the
question
he
could
not
for
he
did
not
know
the
little
doctor
seemed
not
to
have
heard
the
old
man
redoubled
his
exertions
and
reached
them
very
much
out
of
breath
is
he
dead
dell
he
repeated
in
an
awestruck
tone
he
feared
she
would
say
yes
the
little
doctor
had
taken
possession
of
the
brown
head
she
looked
up
at
her
brother
a
very
unprofessional
pallor
upon
her
face
and
down
at
the
long
brown
lashes
and
at
the
curved
sensitive
lips
which
held
no
hint
of
red
she
pressed
the
face
closer
to
her
breast
and
shook
her
head
she
could
not
speak
just
then
for
the
griping
ache
that
was
in
her
throat
one
of
the
best
men
on
the
ranch
gone
under
just
when
we
need
help
the
worst
complained
the
old
man
is
he
hurt
bad
j
began
the
little
doctor
in
a
voice
all
the
fiercer
for
being
suppressed
i
want
you
to
kill
that
horse
do
you
hear
if
you
do
do
it
i
will
you
wo
have
to
if
old
splinter
goes
down
and
out
said
weary
with
quiet
meaning
and
the
little
doctor
gave
him
a
grateful
flash
of
gray
eyes
how
bad
is
he
hurt
repeated
the
old
man
impatiently
supposed
t
be
a
doctor
do
you
know
he
has
a
scalp
wound
which
does
not
seem
serious
said
she
in
an
attempt
to
be
and
his
left
collar
bone
is
doggone
it
a
broken
collar
bone
ai
mended
no
acquiesced
the
little
doctor
it
these
last
two
remarks
chip
heard
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
straight
up
into
the
gray
ones
above
a
long
questioning
rebellious
look
he
tried
then
to
rise
to
free
himself
from
the
bitter
ecstasy
of
those
soft
enfolding
arms
only
a
broken
collar
bone
good
thing
it
was
no
worse
ugh
a
spasm
of
pain
contracted
his
features
and
drew
beads
of
moisture
to
his
forehead
the
spurned
arms
once
more
felt
the
dead
weight
of
him
what
is
it
the
little
doctor
voice
called
to
him
from
afar
must
he
answer
he
wanted
to
drift
on
and
on
can
you
tell
me
where
the
pain
is
pain
oh
yes
there
had
been
pain
but
he
wanted
to
drift
he
opened
his
eyes
again
reluctantly
again
the
pain
clutched
him
it
my
for
the
first
time
the
eyes
of
the
little
doctor
left
his
face
and
traveled
downward
to
the
spurred
boots
one
was
twisted
in
a
horrible
unnatural
position
that
told
the
agonizing
truth
a
badly
dislocated
ankle
they
returned
quickly
to
the
face
and
swam
full
of
blinding
tears
such
as
a
doctor
should
not
succumb
to
he
was
not
drifting
into
oblivion
now
his
teeth
were
not
digging
into
his
lower
lip
for
nothing
she
knew
weary
she
said
forgetting
to
call
him
properly
by
name
ride
to
the
house
and
get
my
medicine
case
the
little
black
one
the
countess
knows
and
have
slim
bring
something
to
carry
him
home
on
and
ride
weary
was
gone
before
she
had
finished
and
he
certainly
you
have
another
crippled
on
yer
hands
first
thing
yuh
know
grumbled
the
old
man
anxiously
as
he
watched
weary
race
recklessly
down
the
hill
the
little
doctor
did
not
answer
she
scarcely
heard
him
she
was
stroking
the
hair
back
from
chip
forehead
softly
unconsciously
wondering
why
she
had
never
before
noticed
the
wave
in
it
but
then
she
had
scarcely
seen
him
with
his
hat
off
how
silky
and
soft
it
felt
and
she
had
called
him
all
sorts
of
mean
names
and
had
wanted
whizzer
to
she
shuddered
and
turned
sick
at
the
memory
of
the
thud
when
they
struck
the
hard
road
together
dell
exclaimed
the
old
man
you
white
a
rag
doggone
it
throw
up
yer
hands
at
yer
first
case
brace
up
chip
looked
up
at
her
curiously
forgetting
the
pain
long
enough
to
wonder
at
her
whiteness
did
she
have
a
heart
then
or
was
it
a
feminine
trait
to
turn
pale
in
every
emergency
she
had
not
turned
so
very
white
when
those
kids
he
felt
inclined
to
laugh
only
for
that
cussed
foot
instead
he
relaxed
his
vigilance
and
a
groan
slipped
out
before
he
knew
just
a
minute
more
and
i
ease
the
pain
for
you
murmured
the
girl
compassionately
all
right
so
long
as
you
do
use
the
stomach
pump
he
retorted
with
a
miserable
makeshift
of
a
laugh
what
that
asked
the
old
man
but
no
one
explained
the
little
doctor
was
struggling
with
the
lump
in
her
throat
that
he
should
try
to
joke
about
it
then
weary
was
back
and
holding
the
little
black
case
out
to
her
she
seized
it
eagerly
slipping
chip
head
to
her
knees
that
she
might
use
her
hands
freely
there
was
no
halting
over
the
tiny
vials
for
she
had
decided
just
what
she
must
do
she
laid
something
against
chip
closed
lips
swallow
these
she
said
and
he
obeyed
her
weary
oh
you
knew
what
to
do
i
see
there
lay
the
coat
down
there
for
a
relieved
of
her
burden
she
rose
and
went
to
the
poor
twisted
foot
weary
and
the
old
man
watched
her
go
to
work
systematically
and
disclose
the
swollen
purpling
ankle
very
gently
she
did
it
and
when
she
had
administered
a
merciful
anaesthetic
the
enthusiasm
of
the
old
man
demanded
speech
well
i
be
eternally
doggoned

your
job

commented
weary
fishing
for
his
cigarette
book
he
was
beginning
to
feel
the
need
of
a
quieting
smoke
they
hauled
me
forty
miles
to
that
must
have
been
torture
shuddered
the
little
doctor
a
dislocated
ankle

a
most
agonizing

match
it

is
all
chapter
xi

mr
davidson
have
you
nerve
enough
to
help
me
replace
this
ankle
the
countess
is
too
nervous
and
is
too
chip
was
lying
oblivious
to
his
surroundings
or
his
hurt
in
the
sunny
south
room
which
dunk
whitaker
chose
to
call
his
i
never
been
accused
of
wanting
nerve
grinned
weary
i
guess
i
can
stand
it
if
you
and
a
very
efficient
assistant
he
proved
himself
to
be
when
the
question
of
a
nurse
arose
when
all
had
been
done
that
could
be
done
and
weary
had
gone
the
little
doctor
found
herself
involved
in
an
argument
with
the
countess
the
countess
wanted
them
to
send
for
bill
bill
just
thought
the
world
and
all
of
chip
she
declared
and
would
just
love
to
come
she
was
positive
that
bill
was
the
very
one
they
needed
and
the
little
doctor
who
had
conceived
a
violent
dislike
for
bill
a
smirky
youth
addicted
to
chewing
tobacco
red
neckties
and
a
perennial
grin
was
equally
positive
he
was
the
very
one
they
did
not
want
in
despair
she
retrenched
herself
behind
the
assertion
that
chip
should
choose
for
himself
i
just
know
he
choose
bill
crowed
the
countess
after
the
flicker
of
the
doctor
skirts
chip
turned
his
head
rebelliously
upon
the
pillow
and
looked
up
at
her
something
in
his
eyes
brought
to
mind
certain
stormy
crises
in
the
headstrong
childhood
of
the
little
in
which
she
was
forced
to
submission
very
much
against
her
will
it
was
the
same
mutinous
surrender
to
overwhelming
strength
the
same
futile
defiance
of
fate
i
came
to
ask
you
who
you
would
rather
have
to
nurse
you
she
said
trying
to
keep
the
erratic
color
from
crimsoning
her
cheeks
you
see
she
had
never
had
a
patient
of
her
very
own
before
and
there
were
certain
embarrassing
complications
in
having
this
particular
young
man
in
charge
chip
eyes
wandered
wistfully
to
the
window
where
a
warm
spring
breeze
flapped
the
curtains
in
and
out
how
long
have
i
got
to
lie
here
he
asked
reluctantly
a
month
at
the
least
more
likely
six
weeks
she
said
with
kind
bluntness
it
was
best
he
should
know
the
worst
at
once
chip
turned
his
face
bitterly
to
the
wall
for
a
minute
and
traced
an
impossible
vine
to
its
breaking
point
where
the
paper
had
not
been
properly
matched
twenty
miles
away
the
boys
were
hurrying
through
their
early
dinner
that
they
might
catch
up
their
horses
for
the
work
and
they
had
two
good
feet
to
walk
on
two
sound
arms
to
subdue
restless
horseflesh
and
he
was
not
there
he
could
fairly
smell
the
sweet
trampled
sod
as
the
horses
circled
endlessly
inside
the
rope
corral
and
hear
them
snort
when
a
noose
swished
close
he
wondered
who
would
get
his
string
to
ride
and
what
they
would
do
with
his
bed
he
did
need
it
now
he
would
lie
on
wire
springs
instead
of
on
the
crisp
prairie
grass
he
would
be
waited
on
like
a
yearling
baby
and
the
countess
just
knows
you
will
choose
bill
interrupted
a
whimsical
girl
voice
chip
said
something
which
the
little
doctor
did
not
try
to
hear
distinctly
do
she
think
i
had
enough
misery
dealt
me
for
once
he
asked
without
taking
his
eyes
from
the
poor
broken
vine
he
rather
pitied
the
vine
it
seemed
to
have
been
badly
used
by
fate
just
as
he
had
been
he
was
sure
it
had
not
wanted
to
stop
right
there
on
that
line
as
it
had
been
forced
to
do
he
had
not
wanted
to
stop
either
he
she
says
bill
would
just
love
to
come
said
the
voice
with
a
bit
of
a
laugh
in
it
chip
turning
his
head
back
suddenly
looked
into
the
gray
eyes
and
felt
inexplicably
cheered
he
almost
believed
she
understood
something
of
what
it
all
meant
to
him
and
she
mercifully
refrained
from
spoken
pity
which
he
felt
he
could
not
have
borne
just
then
his
lips
took
back
some
of
their
curve
you
tell
her
i
would
just
love
to
have
him
he
said
grimly
i
never
dare
she
dotes
on
bill
whom
do
you
want
when
it
comes
to
that
i
do
want
anybody
but
if
you
could
get
johnny
beckman
to
come
oh
i
will
i
go
myself
to
make
sure
of
him
which
one
is
johnny
johnny
the
one
said
chip
but
they
all
yes
but
his
head
is
several
shades
redder
than
any
of
the
others
interrupted
he
quite
cheerfully
the
little
doctor
observing
the
twinkle
in
his
eyes
felt
her
spirits
rise
wonderfully
she
could
not
bear
that
hurt
rebellious
lonely
look
which
they
had
worn
i
bring
him
but
i
may
have
to
chloroform
the
countess
to
get
him
into
the
house
you
must
try
to
sleep
while
i
gone
and
fret
will
you
you
get
well
all
the
quicker
for
taking
things
chip
smiled
faintly
at
this
wholesome
advice
and
the
little
doctor
laid
her
hand
shyly
upon
his
forehead
to
test
its
temperature
drew
down
the
shade
over
the
south
window
and
left
him
in
dim
shadowy
coolness
to
sleep
she
came
again
before
she
started
for
johnny
and
found
him
wide
awake
and
staring
hungrily
at
the
patch
of
blue
sky
visible
through
the
window
which
faced
the
east
you
have
to
learn
to
obey
orders
better
than
this
she
said
severely
and
took
quiet
possession
of
his
wrist
i
told
you
not
to
fret
about
being
hurt
i
know
you
hate
it
chip
flushed
a
little
under
her
touch
and
the
tone
in
which
she
spoke
the
last
words
it
seemed
to
mean
that
she
hated
it
even
more
than
he
did
having
him
helpless
in
the
house
with
her
it
had
been
so
long
since
she
had
told
him
plainly
how
little
she
liked
him
he
was
not
going
to
forget
in
a
hurry
why
do
you
send
me
to
the
hospital
he
demanded
brusquely
i
could
stand
the
trip
all
the
little
doctor
the
color
coming
and
going
in
her
cheeks
pressed
her
cool
fingers
against
his
forehead
because
i
want
you
here
to
practice
on
do
you
think
i
let
such
a
chance
escape
after
she
was
gone
chip
found
some
things
to
puzzle
over
he
felt
that
he
was
no
match
for
the
little
doctor
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
deeply
regretted
his
ignorance
of
woman
nature
when
the
dishes
were
done
the
countess
put
her
resentment
behind
her
and
went
in
to
sit
with
chip
with
the
best
of
intentions
the
most
disagreeable
trait
of
some
disagreeable
people
is
that
their
intentions
are
invariably
good
she
had
her
crochy
work
and
chip
groaned
inwardly
when
he
saw
her
settle
herself
comfortably
in
a
and
unwind
her
thread
the
countess
had
worked
hard
all
her
life
and
her
hands
were
red
and
there
was
no
pleasure
in
watching
their
clever
manipulation
of
the
little
steel
hook
if
it
had
been
the
little
doctor
hands
now
chip
turned
again
to
the
decapitated
pale
blue
vine
with
its
pink
flowers
and
no
leaves
the
countess
counted
off
chain
and
began
in
a
constrained
tone
such
as
some
people
employ
against
helpless
sick
folk
how
yuh
feelin
now
yuh
want
a
drink
or
anything
chip
did
not
want
a
drink
and
he
felt
all
right
he
guessed
the
countess
thought
to
cheer
him
a
little
well
i
do
think
it
too
bad
yuh
got
t
lay
here
all
through
this
purty
spring
weather
if
it
had
been
in
the
winter
when
it
cold
and
stormy
outside
a
person
would
mind
it
s
much
i
know
yuh
must
feel
purty
blew
over
it
fer
yuh
was
always
sech
a
hand
t
be
tearin
around
the
country
on
the
dead
run
seems
like
i
always
told
mary
weary
always
rode
like
the
sheriff
a
mile
yuh
i
you
feel
it
all
the
more
seein
the
jest
out
weary
said
yuh
was
playin
big
luck
if
yuh
only
knew
enough
cash
in
yer
chips
at
the
right
time
but
he
afraid
yuh
would
be
watching
the
game
close
enough
an
ud
lose
yer
pile
i
do
know
what
he
was
drivin
at
an
i
guess
he
did
neither
it
too
bad
anyway
i
guess
yuh
did
expect
t
wind
up
in
bed
when
yuh
rode
off
up
the
hill
but
as
the
sayin
is
plans
an
god
displans
an
i
guess
it
so
here
yuh
are
laid
up
fer
the
summer
dell
says
the
las
thing
on
earth
i
guess
that
yuh
was
lookin
fer
an
yuh
rode
buckin
bronks
right
along
too
i
never
looked
fer
whizzer
t
buck
yuh
off
i
must
say
yuh
got
the
name
uh
bein
sech
a
good
rider
too
but
they
say
the
pitcher
always
goin
t
the
well
is
bound
t
git
busted
sometime
an
i
guess
your
turn
come
t
git
busted
anyway
i
did
get
bucked
off
broke
in
chip
angrily
a
bronch
fighter
is
not
more
jealous
of
his
sweetheart
than
of
his
reputation
as
a
rider
a
fellow
ca
very
well
make
a
pretty
ride
while
his
horse
is
turning
a
oh
well
i
did
happen
t
se
it
i
thought
weary
said
yuh
got
throwed
off
on
the
hog
back
anyway
i
do
know
it
makes
much
difference
how
yuh
happened
t
hit
the
ground
i
guess
it
does
make
a
difference
cried
chip
hotly
his
eyes
took
on
the
glitter
of
fever
it
makes
a
whole
heap
of
difference
let
me
tell
you
i
like
to
hear
weary
or
anybody
else
stand
up
and
tell
me
that
i
got
bucked
off
i
may
be
pretty
badly
smashed
up
but
i
come
pretty
near
showing
him
where
he
oh
well
yuh
need
go
t
work
an
git
mad
about
it
remonstrated
the
countess
dropping
her
thread
in
her
perturbation
at
his
excitement
the
spool
rolled
under
the
bed
and
she
was
obliged
to
get
down
upon
her
knees
and
claw
it
back
and
she
jarred
the
bed
and
set
chip
foot
to
hurting
again
something
awful
when
she
finally
secured
the
spool
and
resumed
her
chair
chip
eyes
were
tightly
closed
but
the
look
of
his
mouth
and
the
flush
in
his
cheeks
together
with
his
quick
breathing
precluded
the
belief
that
he
was
asleep
the
countess
was
not
a
fool
she
saw
at
once
that
fever
which
the
little
doctor
had
feared
was
fast
taking
hold
of
him
she
rolled
her
half
yard
of
edging
around
the
spool
of
thread
jabbed
the
hook
through
the
lump
and
went
out
and
told
the
old
man
that
chip
was
getting
worse
every
minute
which
was
the
truth
the
old
map
knocked
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
and
went
in
to
look
at
him
did
weary
say
i
got
bucked
off
demanded
the
sick
man
before
the
old
man
was
fairly
in
the
room
if
he
did
he
lied
that
all
i
think
weary
do
me
dirt
like
that
i
thought
he
stand
by
me
if
anybody
would
he
knows
i
was
throwed
i
here
young
fellow
put
in
the
old
man
calmly
do
yuh
git
rampagin
around
over
nothin
you
turn
over
there
an
go
t
i
be
hanged
if
i
will
retorted
chip
if
weary
taken
to
lying
about
me
i
have
it
out
with
him
if
i
break
all
the
rest
of
my
bones
doing
it
do
you
think
i
going
to
stand
a
thing
like
that
i
see
easy
there
doggone
it
i
never
heard
weary
yuh
got
bucked
off
whizzer
turned
over
on
his
head
near
as
i
c
make
out
fer
dust
i
took
it
he
turned
a
chip
befogged
brain
caught
at
the
last
word
yes
that
just
what
he
did
it
beats
me
how
weary
could
say
or
even
think
that
i
it
was
the
jack
rabbit
first
and
i
told
her
the
supply
was
limited
and
if
we
do
furnish
lots
of
amusement
but
i
guess
i
made
her
understand
i
was
so
easy
as
she
took
me
to
be
she
hey
the
old
man
could
hardly
be
blamed
for
losing
the
drift
of
rapid
utterances
if
we
want
to
get
them
rounded
up
before
the
dance
i
it
a
good
thing
it
was
poison
for
seven
dead
kids
at
once
the
old
man
knew
something
about
sickness
himself
he
hurried
out
returning
in
a
moment
with
a
bowl
of
cool
water
and
a
fringed
napkin
which
he
pilfered
from
the
table
wisely
intending
to
bathe
chip
head
but
chip
would
have
none
of
him
or
his
wise
intentions
he
jerked
the
wet
napkin
from
the
old
man
fingers
and
threw
it
down
behind
the
bed
knocked
up
the
bowl
of
water
into
the
old
man
face
and
called
him
some
very
bad
names
the
countess
came
and
looked
in
and
chip
hurled
a
pillow
at
her
and
called
her
a
bad
name
also
so
that
she
retreated
to
the
kitchen
with
her
feelings
very
much
hurt
after
that
chip
had
the
south
room
to
himself
until
the
little
doctor
returned
with
johnny
the
old
man
looking
rather
scared
met
her
on
the
porch
the
little
doctor
read
his
face
before
she
was
off
her
horse
what
the
matter
is
he
worse
she
demanded
abruptly
that
fer
you
t
find
out
i
ai
no
doctor
he
got
on
the
fight
a
while
back
an
took
t
throwin
things
an
usin
langwidge
he
git
out
uh
bed
thank
the
lord
or
we
be
takin
t
the
hills
by
then
somebody
has
it
to
answer
for
he
was
all
right
when
i
left
him
two
hours
ago
with
not
a
sign
of
fever
has
the
countess
been
pestering
him
no
said
the
countess
popping
her
head
out
of
the
kitchen
window
and
speaking
in
an
aggrieved
tone
i
hope
i
never
pester
anybody
i
went
an
done
all
i
could
t
cheer
up
an
that
all
the
thanks
i
git
fer
it
i
must
say
some
folks
ai
overburdened
with
gratitude
the
little
doctor
did
not
wait
to
hear
her
out
she
went
straight
to
the
south
room
pulling
off
her
gloves
on
the
way
the
pillow
on
the
floor
told
her
an
eloquent
tale
and
she
sighed
as
she
picked
it
up
and
patted
some
shape
back
into
it
chip
stared
at
her
with
wide
bright
eyes
from
the
bed
i
do
suppose
cecil
granthum
would
throw
pillows
at
anybody
he
remarked
sarcastically
as
she
placed
it
very
gently
under
his
head
perhaps
if
the
provocation
was
great
enough
what
have
they
been
doing
to
you
did
weary
say
i
got
bucked
off
he
demanded
excitedly
the
little
doctor
was
counting
his
pulse
and
waited
till
she
had
finished
it
was
a
high
number
much
higher
than
she
liked
no
weary
did
how
could
he
you
did
you
know
i
saw
it
all
from
the
bluff
and
i
know
the
horse
turned
over
upon
you
it
a
wonder
you
were
killed
outright
now
do
worry
about
it
any
more
i
expect
it
was
the
countess
told
you
that
weary
hated
dreadfully
to
leave
you
i
wonder
if
you
know
how
much
he
thinks
of
you
i
did
till
i
saw
how
he
looked
when
you
here
drink
this
all
of
it
you
got
to
sleep
you
there
was
a
week
when
the
house
was
kept
very
still
and
the
south
room
very
cool
and
shadowy
and
chip
did
not
much
care
who
it
was
that
ministered
to
him
only
that
the
hands
of
the
little
doctor
were
always
soft
and
soothing
on
his
head
and
he
wished
she
would
keep
them
there
always
when
he
was
himself
enough
to
wish
anything
coherently
chapter
xii
the
last
to
use
a
trite
expression
and
say
that
chip
fought
his
way
back
to
health
would
be
simply
stating
a
fact
and
stating
it
mildly
he
went
about
it
much
as
he
would
go
about
gentling
a
refractory
broncho
and
with
nearly
the
same
results
his
ankle
however
simply
could
not
be
hurried
or
bluffed
into
premature
soundness
and
the
little
doctor
was
at
her
wits
end
to
keep
chip
from
fretting
himself
back
into
fever
once
he
was
safely
pulled
out
of
it
she
made
haste
to
explain
the
bit
of
overheard
conversation
which
he
harped
on
more
than
he
dreamed
when
his
head
went
light
in
that
first
week
and
so
established
a
more
friendly
feeling
between
them
still
there
was
a
certain
aloofness
about
him
which
she
could
not
conquer
try
as
she
might
just
so
far
they
were
comrades
beyond
chip
walked
moodily
alone
the
little
doctor
did
not
like
that
overmuch
she
preferred
to
know
that
she
fairly
understood
her
friends
and
was
admitted
sometimes
to
their
full
confidence
she
did
not
relish
bumping
her
head
against
a
blank
wall
that
was
too
high
to
look
over
or
to
climb
and
in
which
there
seemed
to
be
no
door
to
be
sure
he
talked
freely
and
amusingly
of
his
adventures
and
of
the
places
he
had
known
but
it
was
always
an
impersonal
recital
and
told
little
of
his
real
self
or
his
real
feelings
still
when
she
asked
him
he
told
her
exactly
what
he
thought
about
things
whether
his
opinion
pleased
her
or
not
there
were
times
when
he
would
sit
in
the
old
morris
chair
and
smoke
and
watch
her
make
lacey
stuff
in
a
little
round
frame
battenberg
she
said
it
was
he
loved
to
see
her
fingers
manipulate
the
needle
and
the
thread
and
take
wonderful
pains
with
her
work
but
once
she
showed
him
a
butterfly
whose
wings
did
not
quite
match
and
he
pointed
it
out
to
her
she
had
been
listening
to
him
tell
a
story
of
indians
and
cowboys
and
with
some
wild
riding
mixed
into
it
and
well
she
used
the
wrong
stitch
but
no
one
would
notice
it
in
a
thousand
years
this
her
argument
you
always
know
the
mistake
there
and
you
wo
get
the
satisfaction
out
of
it
you
would
if
it
was
perfect
would
you
argued
chip
letting
his
eyes
dwell
on
her
face
more
than
was
good
for
him
the
little
doctor
pouted
her
lips
in
a
way
to
tempt
a
man
all
he
could
stand
and
snipped
out
the
wing
with
her
scissors
and
did
it
over
so
with
her
painting
she
started
a
scene
in
the
edge
of
the
bad
lands
down
the
river
chip
knew
the
place
well
there
was
a
heated
discussion
over
the
foreground
for
the
little
doctor
wanted
him
to
sketch
in
some
indian
tepees
and
some
squaws
for
her
and
chip
absolutely
refused
to
do
so
he
said
there
were
no
indians
in
that
country
and
it
would
spoil
the
whole
picture
anyway
the
little
doctor
threatened
to
sketch
them
herself
drawing
on
her
imagination
and
what
little
she
knew
of
indians
but
something
in
his
eyes
stayed
her
hand
she
left
the
easel
in
disgust
and
refused
to
touch
it
again
for
a
week
she
was
to
spend
a
long
day
with
miss
satterly
the
and
started
off
soon
after
breakfast
one
morning
i
hope
you
find
something
to
keep
you
out
of
mischief
while
gone
she
remarked
with
a
pretty
authoritative
air
make
him
take
his
medicine
johnny
and
do
let
him
have
the
crutches
well
i
think
i
shall
hide
them
to
make
i
wish
to
goodness
you
had
that
picture
done
grumbled
chip
it
seems
to
me
you
doing
a
heap
of
running
around
lately
why
do
you
finish
it
up
those
lonesome
hills
are
getting
on
my
i
cover
it
up
said
she
let
it
be
i
like
to
look
at
chip
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
watched
her
a
hunger
greater
than
he
knew
in
his
eyes
it
was
most
awfully
lonesome
when
she
was
gone
all
day
and
last
night
she
had
been
writing
all
the
evening
to
cecil
granthum
damn
him
chip
always
hitched
that
invective
to
the
unknown
doctor
name
for
some
reason
he
saw
fit
not
to
explain
to
himself
he
did
see
what
she
could
find
to
write
about
so
much
for
his
part
and
he
did
hate
a
long
day
with
no
one
but
johnny
to
talk
to
he
craned
his
neck
to
keep
her
in
view
as
long
as
possible
drew
a
long
discontented
breath
and
settled
himself
more
comfortably
in
the
chair
where
he
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
waking
hours
hand
me
the
tobacco
will
you
kid
he
fished
his
cigarette
book
from
his
pocket
thanks
he
tore
a
narrow
strip
from
the
paper
and
sifted
in
a
little
tobacco
now
a
match
kid
and
then
you
johnny
placed
the
matches
within
easy
reach
shoved
a
few
magazines
close
to
chip
elbow
and
stretched
himself
upon
the
floor
with
a
book
chip
lay
back
against
the
cushions
and
smoked
lazily
his
eyes
half
closed
dreaming
rather
than
thinking
the
unfinished
painting
stood
facing
him
upon
its
easel
and
his
eyes
idly
fixed
upon
it
he
knew
the
place
so
well
jagged
pinnacles
dotted
here
and
there
with
scrubby
pines
hemmed
in
a
tiny
basin
below
where
was
blank
canvas
he
went
mentally
over
the
argument
again
and
from
that
drifted
to
a
scene
he
had
witnessed
in
that
same
basin
one
day
but
that
was
in
the
winter
dirty
gray
snow
drifts
where
a
chinook
had
cut
them
and
icy
side
hills
made
the
place
still
drearier
and
the
foreground
if
the
little
doctor
could
get
that
now
she
would
be
doing
something
ah
that
foreground
a
poor
range
cow
with
her
calf
which
the
had
overlooked
in
the
fall
stood
at
bay
against
a
steep
cut
bank
before
them
squatted
five
great
gaunt
wolves
intent
upon
fresh
beef
for
their
supper
but
the
cow
horns
were
long
and
sharp
and
threatening
and
the
calf
snuggled
close
to
her
side
shivering
with
the
cold
and
the
fear
of
death
the
wolves
licked
their
cruel
lips
and
their
eyes
gleamed
hungrily
but
the
eyes
of
the
cow
answered
them
gleam
for
gleam
if
it
could
be
put
upon
canvas
just
as
he
had
seen
it
with
the
bitter
biting
cold
of
a
frozen
chinook
showing
gray
and
sinister
in
the
slaty
sky
kid
huh
johnny
struggled
reluctantly
back
to
montana
get
me
the
little
doctor
paint
and
truck
over
on
that
table
and
slide
that
easel
up
johnny
stared
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
then
wisely
closed
it
and
did
as
he
was
bidden
philosophically
he
told
himself
it
was
chip
funeral
if
the
little
doctor
made
a
kick
all
right
chip
tossed
the
cigarette
stub
out
of
the
window
you
can
go
ahead
and
read
now
lock
the
door
first
and
do
you
bother
me
not
on
your
then
chip
plunged
headlong
into
the
bad
lands
so
to
speak
a
few
dabs
of
dirty
white
here
and
there
a
wholly
original
manipulation
of
the
sky
what
mattered
the
method
so
he
attained
the
result
half
an
hour
and
the
hills
were
clutched
in
the
chill
embrace
of
a
frozen
chinook
such
as
the
little
doctor
had
never
seen
in
her
life
but
johnny
peeping
surreptitiously
over
chip
shoulder
stared
at
the
change
then
feeling
the
spirit
of
it
shivered
in
sympathy
with
the
barren
hills
hully
gee
he
muttered
under
his
breath
he
sure
a
corker
paint
cold
that
fair
makes
yer
nose
and
he
curled
up
in
a
chair
behind
where
he
could
steal
a
look
now
and
then
without
fear
of
detection
but
chip
was
dead
to
all
save
that
tiny
basin
in
the
bad
lands
to
the
wolves
and
their
quarry
his
eyes
burned
as
they
did
when
the
fever
held
him
each
cheek
bone
glowed
flaming
red
as
wolf
after
wolf
appeared
with
what
to
johnny
seemed
uncanny
swiftness
and
squatted
grinning
and
sinister
in
a
relentless
half
circle
the
book
slipped
unheeded
to
the
floor
with
a
clatter
that
failed
to
rouse
the
painter
whose
ears
were
dulled
to
all
else
than
the
pitiful
blat
of
a
shivering
calf
whose
nose
sought
his
mother
side
for
her
comforting
warmth
and
protection
the
countess
rapped
on
the
door
for
dinner
and
johnny
rose
softly
and
tiptoed
out
to
quiet
her
may
he
be
forgiven
the
lies
he
told
that
day
of
how
chip
head
ached
and
he
wanted
to
sleep
and
must
not
be
disturbed
by
strict
orders
of
the
little
doctor
the
countess
to
whom
the
very
name
of
the
little
doctor
was
a
fetich
closed
all
intervening
doors
and
walked
on
her
toes
in
the
kitchen
and
johnny
rejoiced
at
the
funeral
quiet
which
rested
upon
the
house
faster
flew
the
brush
now
the
eyes
of
the
cow
glared
desperate
defiance
one
might
almost
see
her
bony
side
ruffled
by
the
cutting
north
wind
heave
with
her
breathing
she
was
fighting
death
for
herself
and
her
baby
but
for
how
long
already
the
nose
of
one
great
gray
beast
was
straight
uplifted
sniffing
impatient
would
they
risk
a
charge
upon
those
lowered
horns
the
dark
pines
shook
their
feathery
heads
hopelessly
a
little
while
perhaps
and
then
chip
laid
down
the
brush
and
sank
back
in
the
chair
was
the
sun
so
low
he
could
do
no
more
yes
he
took
up
a
brush
and
added
the
title
the
last
he
was
very
white
and
his
hand
shook
johnny
leaned
over
the
back
of
the
chair
his
eyes
glued
to
the
picture
gee
he
muttered
huskily
i
like
t
git
a
whack
at
them
wolves
chip
turned
his
head
until
he
could
look
at
the
lad
face
what
do
you
think
of
it
kid
he
asked
shakily
johnny
did
not
answer
for
a
moment
it
was
hard
to
put
what
he
felt
into
words
i
dunno
just
how
t
say
it
he
said
gropingly
at
last
but
it
makes
me
want
t
go
gunnin
fer
them
wolves
they
hamstring
her
it
well
it
do
seem
t
me
like
it
was
a
pitcher
somehow
it
seems
like
the
reel
thing
chip
moved
his
head
languidly
upon
the
cushion
i
dead
tired
kid
no
i
not
hungry
nor
i
do
want
any
coffee
or
anything
just
roll
this
chair
over
to
the
bed
will
you
i
johnny
was
worried
he
did
not
know
what
the
little
doctor
would
say
for
chip
had
not
eaten
his
dinner
or
taken
his
medicine
somehow
there
had
been
that
in
his
face
that
had
made
johnny
afraid
to
speak
to
him
he
went
back
to
the
easel
and
looked
long
at
the
picture
his
heart
bursting
with
rage
that
he
could
not
take
his
rifle
and
shoot
those
merciless
grinning
brutes
even
after
he
had
drawn
the
curtain
before
it
and
stood
the
easel
in
its
accustomed
place
he
kept
lifting
the
curtain
to
take
another
look
at
that
wordless
tragedy
of
the
west
chapter
xiii
art
critics
it
was
late
the
next
forenoon
when
the
little
doctor
feeling
the
spirit
of
artistic
achievement
within
her
gathered
up
brushes
and
paints
for
a
couple
hours
work
chip
sitting
by
the
window
smoking
a
cigarette
watched
her
uneasily
from
the
tail
of
his
eye
looking
back
to
yesterday
spasm
as
he
dubbed
it
mentally
he
was
filled
with
a
great
and
unaccountable
shyness
what
had
seemed
so
real
to
him
then
he
feared
to
face
as
trivial
and
weak
he
wanted
to
cry
stop
when
she
laid
hand
to
the
curtain
but
he
looked
instead
out
across
the
coulee
to
the
hills
beyond
the
blood
surging
unevenly
through
his
veins
he
felt
when
she
drew
the
cloth
aside
she
stopped
short
off
in
the
middle
of
telling
him
something
miss
satterly
had
said
some
whimsical
thing
and
he
could
hear
his
heart
pounding
in
the
silence
which
followed
the
little
nickel
alarm
clock
with
such
maddening
precision
and
speed
that
chip
wanted
to
shy
a
book
at
it
but
his
eyes
never
left
the
rocky
bluff
opposite
and
the
clock
ticked
merrily
on
one
minute
two
the
silence
was
getting
unbearable
he
could
not
endure
another
second
he
looked
toward
her
she
stood
one
hand
full
of
brushes
gazing
at
the
last
as
he
looked
a
tear
rolled
down
the
cheek
nearest
him
and
compelled
him
to
speech
what
the
matter
his
voice
seemed
to
him
rough
and
brutal
but
he
did
not
mean
it
so
the
little
doctor
drew
a
long
quivering
breath
oh
the
poor
brave
thing
she
said
in
a
hushed
tone
she
turned
sharply
away
and
sat
down
i
expect
i
spoiled
your
picture
all
right
but
i
told
you
i
get
into
mischief
if
you
went
gadding
around
and
left
me
the
little
doctor
stealthily
wiped
her
eyes
hoping
to
goodness
chip
had
not
seen
that
they
had
need
of
wiping
why
did
you
tell
me
you
could
paint
like
that
she
turned
upon
him
fiercely
here
you
sat
and
looked
on
at
me
daubing
things
up
and
if
i
known
you
could
do
better
than
looking
again
at
the
canvas
she
forgot
to
finish
the
fascination
of
it
held
her
i
not
in
the
habit
of
going
around
the
country
shouting
what
i
know
said
chip
defensively
you
taken
heaps
of
lessons
and
i
never
did
i
just
noticed
the
color
of
everything
and
oh
i
know
it
in
me
to
do
those
things
i
ca
help
trying
to
paint
and
i
suppose
old
von
heim
would
have
something
to
say
of
your
way
of
doing
clouds
but
you
got
the
effect
though
better
than
he
did
sometimes
and
that
cow
i
can
see
her
breathe
i
tell
you
and
the
wolves
oh
do
sit
there
and
smoke
your
everlasting
cigarettes
and
look
so
stoical
over
it
what
are
you
made
of
anyway
ca
you
feel
proud
oh
do
you
know
what
you
done
i
i
like
to
shake
you
so
now
well
i
do
much
blame
you
i
knew
i
no
business
to
meddle
maybe
if
you
touch
it
up
a
little
i
not
touch
a
brush
to
that
i
i
afraid
i
might
kill
the
she
gave
a
little
hysterical
laugh
do
you
think
you
rather
excitable
for
a
doctor
scoffed
chip
and
her
chin
went
up
for
a
minute
i
like
t
kill
them
wolves
said
johnny
coming
in
just
then
turn
the
thing
around
kid
so
i
can
see
it
commanded
chip
suddenly
i
worked
at
it
yesterday
till
the
colors
all
ran
together
and
i
could
tell
much
about
johnny
turned
the
easel
and
chip
looking
fell
silent
had
his
hand
guided
the
brush
while
that
scene
grew
from
blank
canvas
to
palpitating
reality
verily
he
had
builded
better
than
he
something
in
his
throat
gripped
achingly
and
dry
did
anybody
see
it
yesterday
asked
the
little
doctor
no
not
unless
the
kid
i
never
said
a
word
about
it
denied
johnny
hastily
and
vehemently
i
lied
like
the
dickens
i
said
you
had
headache
an
was
tryin
t
sleep
it
off
i
kep
the
countess
around
on
her
toes
all
johnny
giggled
at
the
memory
of
it
well
i
going
to
call
them
all
in
and
see
what
they
say
declared
she
starting
for
the
door
i
do
think
you
will
began
chip
rebelliously
blushing
over
his
achievement
like
a
girl
over
her
graduation
essay
i
do
want
to
be
well
we
need
tell
them
you
did
it
suggested
she
oh
if
you
willing
to
shoulder
the
blame
compromised
chip
much
relieved
he
hated
to
be
fussed
over
the
little
doctor
regarded
him
attentively
a
moment
smiled
queerly
to
herself
and
stood
back
to
get
a
better
view
of
the
painting
i
shoulder
the
blame
and
maybe
claim
the
glory
it
was
mine
in
the
first
place
you
she
watched
him
from
under
her
lashes
yes
it
yours
all
right
said
chip
readily
but
something
went
out
of
his
face
and
lodged
rather
painfully
in
the
deepest
corner
of
his
heart
he
ignored
it
proudly
and
smiled
back
at
her
do
such
things
really
happen
out
here
she
asked
hurriedly
i
tell
a
man
said
chip
his
eyes
returning
to
the
picture
i
was
riding
through
that
country
last
winter
and
i
came
upon
that
very
cow
just
as
you
see
her
there
in
that
same
basin
that
how
i
came
to
paint
it
into
your
foreground
i
got
to
thinking
about
it
and
i
could
help
trying
to
put
it
on
canvas
only
i
opened
up
on
the
wolves
with
my
and
i
got
two
that
big
fellow
ready
to
howl
there
and
that
one
next
the
the
rest
broke
out
down
the
coulee
and
made
for
the
breaks
where
i
could
follow
they
say
old
dunk
comin
announced
johnny
hurrying
in
why
do
yuh
let
see
the
pitcher
an
think
all
the
time
the
little
doctor
done
it
gee
it
be
great
t
hear
go
on
an
praise
it
up
like
he
always
does
an
not
know
the
johnny
you
a
genius
cried
she
effusively
do
tell
a
soul
that
chip
had
a
brush
in
his
hand
yesterday
will
you
he
he
rather
not
have
anyone
know
he
did
anything
to
the
painting
you
aw
i
wo
tell
interrupted
johnny
gruffly
eying
his
divinity
with
distrust
for
the
first
time
in
his
short
acquaintance
with
her
was
she
mean
enough
to
claim
it
really
just
at
first
as
a
joke
it
would
be
fun
but
afterward
oh
she
would
do
a
thing
like
that
do
you
bring
dunk
in
here
warned
chip
or
things
might
happen
i
do
want
to
run
up
against
him
again
till
i
got
two
good
feet
to
stand
their
relation
was
a
thing
to
be
watched
over
tenderly
since
month
of
invalidism
dunk
had
notions
concerning
master
and
servant
and
concerning
chip
as
an
individual
he
did
not
fancy
occupying
the
back
bedroom
while
chip
reigned
in
his
sunny
south
room
waited
on
petted
dunk
applied
the
term
petted
and
amused
indefatigably
by
the
little
doctor
and
there
had
been
a
scene
short
but
exceeding
strenuous
over
a
pencil
sketch
which
graphically
portrayed
an
incident
dunk
fain
would
forget
the
incident
of
himself
as
a
broncho
fighter
with
banjo
of
vigilante
fame
as
the
means
of
his
downfall
physical
mental
and
spiritual
dunk
might
in
time
have
forgiven
the
crippled
ankle
and
the
consequent
appropriation
of
his
room
but
never
would
he
forgive
the
merciless
detail
of
that
sketch
i
carry
easel
and
all
into
the
parlor
and
leave
the
door
open
so
you
can
hear
what
they
all
say
said
the
little
doctor
cheerfully
i
wish
cecil
could
be
here
i
always
miss
cecil
when
anything
especial
going
on
in
the
way
of
yes
answered
chip
and
made
himself
another
cigarette
he
would
be
glad
when
he
could
hobble
out
to
some
lonely
spot
and
empty
his
soul
of
the
profane
language
stored
away
opposite
the
name
of
cecil
granthum
there
is
so
little
comfort
in
swearing
all
inside
when
one
feels
deeply
upon
a
subject
it
a
wonder
you
would
send
for
him
if
you
miss
him
that
bad
he
remarked
after
a
minute
hoping
the
little
doctor
would
not
find
anything
amiss
with
his
tone
which
he
meant
should
be
cordial
and
interested
and
which
evinced
plenty
of
interest
of
a
kind
but
was
curiously
lacking
in
cordiality
i
did
beg
and
tease
and
entreat
but
cecil
in
a
hospital
as
a
physician
you
understand
not
as
a
patient
and
ca
get
off
just
yet
in
a
month
or
two
perhaps
dinner
called
shrilly
by
the
countess
interrupted
her
and
she
flitted
out
of
the
room
looking
as
little
like
a
lovelorn
maiden
as
she
did
like
a
doctor
which
was
little
indeed
she
begged
and
teased
and
entreated
repeated
chip
savagely
to
himself
when
the
door
closed
upon
her
and
fell
into
gloomy
meditation
which
left
him
feeling
that
there
was
no
good
thing
in
this
wicked
world
no
not
one
that
was
not
appropriated
by
some
one
with
not
sense
enough
to
understand
and
appreciate
his
blessing
after
dinner
the
little
doctor
spoke
to
the
unsuspecting
critics
that
picture
which
i
started
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
is
finished
at
last
and
i
want
you
good
people
to
come
and
tell
me
what
you
think
of
it
i
want
you
all
you
slim
and
louise
you
are
to
come
and
give
your
well
i
do
know
the
first
thing
about
paintin
remonstrated
the
countess
coming
in
from
the
kitchen
the
old
man
lighted
his
pipe
and
followed
her
into
the
parlor
with
the
others
and
slim
rolled
a
cigarette
to
hide
his
embarrassment
for
the
role
of
art
critic
was
new
to
him
there
was
some
nervousness
in
the
little
doctor
manner
as
she
set
the
easel
to
her
liking
and
drew
aside
the
curtain
she
did
not
mean
to
be
theatrical
about
it
but
chip
watching
through
the
open
door
fancied
so
and
let
his
lip
curl
a
trifle
he
was
not
in
a
happy
frame
of
mind
just
then
a
silence
fell
upon
the
group
the
old
man
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
stared
the
cheeks
of
the
little
doctor
paled
and
grew
pink
again
she
laughed
a
bit
as
though
she
would
much
rather
cry
say
something
somebody
quick
she
cried
when
her
nerves
would
bear
no
more
well
i
do
think
it
awfully
good
dell
began
the
countess
by
golly
i
do
see
how
you
done
that
without
seein
it
happen
exclaimed
slim
looking
very
dazed
and
mystified
that
a
diamond
bar
cow
remarked
abstractedly
that
outfit
never
does
git
half
their

that
too
slim
always
slow
and
very
much
in
earnest
gradually
became
infused
with
the
spirit
of
the
scene
jest
look
at
that
ole
gray
sinner
with
his
nose
straight
up
in
the
air
over
there
by
golly
he
callin
all
his
wife

ole
diamon

with
head
down

rollin
all

ready
fer
the
first
darn
cuss

a
crooked

scatteration
among
a

could
easy
but
slim
they
nothing
but
paint
the
little
doctor
eyes
were
shining
slim
turned
red
and
grinned
sheepishly
at
the
others
i
kinda
fergot
it
was
nothin
but
a
pitcher
he
stammered
apologetically
that
is
the
gist
of
the
whole
matter
said
dunk
you
could
ask
for
a
greater
compliment
or
higher
praise
than
that
miss
della
one
forgets
that
it
is
a
picture
one
only
feels
a
deep
longing
for
a
good
rifle
you
must
let
me
take
it
with
me
to
butte
that
picture
will
make
you
famous
among
cattlemen
at
least
that
is
to
say
out
west
here
and
if
you
will
sell
it
i
am
positive
i
can
get
you
a
high
price
for
the
eyes
of
the
little
doctor
involuntarily
sought
the
morris
chair
in
the
next
room
but
chip
was
looking
out
across
the
coulee
as
he
had
a
habit
of
doing
lately
and
seemed
not
to
hear
what
was
going
on
in
the
parlor
he
was
indifference
personified
if
one
might
judge
from
his
outward
appearance
the
little
doctor
turned
her
glance
resentfully
to
her
brother
partner
do
you
mean
all
that
she
demanded
of
him
i
certainly
do
it
is
great
miss
della
i
admit
that
it
is
not
quite
like
your
other
work
the
treatment
seems
different
in
places
and
er
stronger
it
is
the
best
picture
of
the
kind
that
i
have
ever
seen
i
think
it
holds
one
in
a
way
by
golly
i
bet
chip
took
a
pitcher
uh
that
exclaimed
slim
who
had
been
doing
some
hard
thinking
he
was
tellin
us
last
winter
about
ridin
up
on
that
ole
diamon
bar
cow
with
a
pack
uh
wolves
around
her
an
her
off
an
he
shot
two
uh
the
wolves
yes
sir
chip
jest
about
got
a
snap
shot
of
well
doggone
it
what
if
he
did
the
old
man
turned
jealously
upon
him
it
ai
everyone
that
kin
paint
like
that
with
nothin
but
a
little
kodak
picture
t
go
by
doggone
it
i
do
care
if
dell
had
a
hull
apurn
full
uh
kodak
pictures
that
chip
took
it
a
rattlin
good
piece
uh
work
all
the
i
ai
sayin
anything
agin
the
pitcher
retorted
slim
i
was
jest
wonderin
how
she
happened
t
git
that
cow
down
s
fine
brand
all
without
some
kind
uh
pattern
t
go
by
s
fur
the
pitcher
goes
it
about
as
good
kin
be
did
with
paint
i
guess
i
ai
ever
seen
anything
in
the
pitcher
line
that
looked
any
well
i
do
think
it
just
splendid
gurgled
the
countess
every
bit
as
good
the
one
mary
got
with
a
year
subscription
t
the
household
treasure
fer
fifty
cents
that
one
got
some
hounds
a
deer
and
a
man
hidin
in
bushes
sost
yuh
kin
jest
see
his
head
it
an
awful
purty
pitcher
but
this
one
jest
as
good
i
do
it
a
little
bit
better
if
anything
mary
has
got
some
awful
nice
green
grass
an
the
sky
an
awful
purty
blue
jest
about
the
color
uh
my
blue
silk
waist
but
yuh
ca
expect
t
have
grass
an
sky
like
that
in
the
winter
an
this
is
more
of
a
winter
pitcher
it
looks
awful
cold
an
lonesome
somehow
an
it
makes
yuh
want
t
cry
if
yuh
look
at
it
long
the
critics
stampeded
as
they
always
did
when
the
countess
began
to
talk
you
better
let
dunk
take
it
with
him
dell
was
the
parting
advice
of
the
old
man
chapter
xiv
convalescence
you
do
mind
do
you
the
little
doctor
was
visibly
uneasy
mind
what
chip
tone
was
one
of
elaborate
unconsciousness
mind
dunk
selling
the
picture
for
you
why
should
i
it
yours
you
i
think
you
have
some
interest
in
it
yourself
she
said
without
looking
at
him
you
do
think
i
mean
to
to
i
do
think
anything
except
that
it
your
picture
and
i
put
in
a
little
time
meddling
with
your
property
for
want
of
something
else
to
do
all
i
painted
does
cover
one
quarter
of
the
canvas
and
i
guess
you
done
enough
for
me
to
more
than
make
up
i
guess
you
worry
over
that
cow
and
calf
you
welcome
to
them
both
and
if
you
can
get
a
bounty
on
those
five
wolves
i
be
glad
to
have
you
just
keep
still
about
my
part
of
chip
really
felt
that
way
about
it
after
the
first
dash
of
wounded
pride
he
could
never
begin
to
square
accounts
with
the
little
doctor
anyhow
and
he
was
proud
that
he
could
do
something
for
her
even
if
it
was
nothing
more
than
fixing
up
a
picture
so
that
it
rose
considerably
above
mediocrity
he
had
meant
it
that
way
all
along
but
the
suspicion
that
she
was
quite
ready
to
appropriate
his
work
rather
shocked
him
just
at
first
no
one
likes
having
a
gift
we
joy
in
bestowing
calmly
taken
from
our
hands
before
it
has
been
offered
he
wanted
her
to
have
the
picture
for
her
very
own
but
but
he
had
not
thought
of
the
possibility
of
her
selling
it
or
of
dunk
as
her
agent
it
was
all
right
of
course
if
she
wanted
to
do
that
with
it
but
there
was
something
about
it
that
hurt
and
the
hurt
of
it
was
not
less
simply
because
he
could
not
locate
the
pain
his
mind
fidgeted
with
the
subject
if
he
could
have
saddled
silver
and
gone
for
a
long
gallop
over
the
prairie
land
he
could
have
grappled
with
his
rebellious
inner
self
and
choked
to
death
several
unwelcome
emotions
he
thought
but
there
was
silver
crippled
and
swung
uncomfortably
in
canvas
wrappings
in
the
box
stall
and
here
was
himself
crippled
and
held
day
after
day
in
one
room
and
one
chair
albeit
a
very
pleasant
room
and
a
very
comfortable
chair
and
a
gallop
as
impossible
to
one
of
them
as
to
the
other
i
do
wish
the
little
doctor
checked
herself
abruptly
and
hummed
a
bit
of
coon
song
what
do
you
wish
chip
pushed
his
thoughts
behind
him
and
tried
to
speak
in
his
usual
manner
nothing
much
i
was
just
wishing
cecil
could
see
last
stand
chip
said
absolutely
nothing
for
five
minutes
and
for
an
excellent
reason
there
was
not
a
single
thought
during
that
time
which
would
sound
pretty
if
put
into
words
and
he
had
no
wish
to
shock
the
little
doctor
after
that
day
a
constraint
fell
upon
them
both
which
each
felt
keenly
and
neither
cared
to
explain
away
the
last
stand
was
tacitly
dismissed
from
their
conversation
of
which
there
grew
less
and
less
as
the
days
passed
then
came
a
time
when
chip
strongly
resented
being
looked
upon
as
an
invalid
and
johnny
was
sent
home
greatly
to
his
sorrow
chip
hobbled
about
the
house
on
crutches
and
chafed
and
fretted
and
managed
to
be
very
miserable
indeed
because
he
could
not
get
out
and
ride
and
clear
his
brain
and
heart
of
some
of
their
hurt
for
it
had
come
to
just
that
he
had
been
compelled
to
own
that
there
was
a
hurt
which
would
not
heal
in
a
hurry
it
was
a
very
bitter
young
man
who
lounging
in
the
big
chair
by
the
window
one
day
suddenly
snorted
contempt
at
a
western
story
he
had
been
reading
and
cast
the
magazine
one
of
the
six
leading
clean
into
the
parlor
where
it
sprawled
its
artistic
leaves
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
the
little
doctor
was
somewhere
he
never
seemed
to
know
just
where
nowadays
and
the
house
was
lonesome
as
an
isolated
peak
in
the
bad
lands
i
wish
i
had
the
making
of
the
laws
i
put
a
bounty
on
all
the
darn
fools
that
think
they
can
write
cowboy
stories
just
because
they
rode
past
a
roundup
once
on
a
fast
train
he
growled
reaching
for
his
tobacco
sack
huh
i
like
to
meet
up
with
the
yahoo
that
wrote
that
rank
yarn
i
ask
him
where
he
got
his
lack
of
information
huh
a
togged
up
like
he
was
going
after
the
snakiest
bronk
in
the
country
when
he
was
only
going
to
drive
to
town
in
a
buckboard
pistol
belt
and
dirk
and
leathern
chaps
oh
lord
oh
lord
and
spurs
i
wonder
if
he
thinks
it
takes
spurs
to
ride
a
buckboard
do
they
think
back
east
that
spurs
grow
on
a
man
heels
out
here
and
wo
come
off
do
they
think
we
sleep
in
i
wonder
he
drew
a
match
along
the
arm
of
the
chair
where
the
varnish
was
worn
off
they
think
all
a
has
to
do
is
eat
and
sleep
and
ride
fat
horses
i
like
to
tell
some
of
them
a
few
things
that
they
do
i
brought
you
a
caller
chip
are
you
glad
to
see
him
it
was
the
little
doctor
at
the
window
and
the
laugh
he
loved
was
in
her
voice
and
in
her
eyes
that
it
hurt
him
to
meet
lately
the
color
surged
to
his
face
and
he
leaned
from
the
window
his
thin
white
hand
outstretched
caressingly
i
tell
a
man
he
said
and
choked
a
little
over
it
silver
old
boy
silver
nickering
softly
limped
forward
and
nestled
his
nose
in
the
palm
of
his
master
he
been
out
in
the
corral
for
several
days
but
i
did
tell
you
i
wanted
it
for
a
surprise
said
the
little
doctor
this
is
his
longest
trip
but
he
soon
be
well
yes
i
give
a
good
deal
if
i
could
walk
as
well
as
he
can
said
chip
gloomily
he
was
hurt
as
badly
as
you
were
you
ought
to
be
thankful
you
can
walk
at
all
and
that
you
wo
limp
all
your
life
i
was
afraid
for
a
while
just
at
first
you
were
why
did
you
tell
me
chip
eyes
were
fixed
sternly
upon
her
because
i
did
want
to
it
would
only
have
made
matters
worse
anyway
and
you
wo
limp
you
know
if
you
careful
for
a
while
longer
i
going
to
get
silver
his
sugar
he
has
sugar
every
silver
lifted
his
head
and
looked
after
her
inquiringly
whinnied
complainingly
and
prepared
to
follow
as
best
he
could
silver
oh
silver
chip
snapped
his
fingers
to
attract
his
attention
hang
the
luck
come
back
here
would
you
throw
down
your
best
friend
for
that
girl
has
she
got
to
have
you
too
his
voice
grew
wistfully
rebellious
you
mine
come
back
here
you
little
fool
she
silver
stopped
at
the
corner
swung
his
head
and
looked
back
at
chip
beckoning
coaxing
swearing
under
his
breath
his
eyes
sought
for
sign
of
his
goddess
who
had
disappeared
most
mysteriously
throwing
up
his
head
he
sent
a
protest
shrilling
through
the
air
and
looked
no
more
at
chip
i
coming
now
be
still
oh
do
you
dare
paw
with
your
lame
leg
why
did
you
stay
with
your
master
he
no
use
for
his
master
any
more
said
chip
with
a
hurt
laugh
a
woman
always
does
play
the
mischief
somehow
i
wonder
why
they
look
innocent
wait
till
your
turn
comes
and
perhaps
you
learn
why
retorted
she
chip
knowing
that
his
turn
had
come
and
come
to
tarry
found
nothing
to
say
beside
continued
the
little
doctor
silver
did
want
me
so
much
it
was
the
sugar
i
hope
you
are
jealous
of
me
because
i
know
his
heart
is
big
enough
to
hold
us
she
stayed
a
long
half
hour
and
was
so
gay
that
it
seemed
like
old
times
to
listen
to
her
laugh
and
watch
her
dimples
while
she
talked
chip
forgot
that
he
had
a
quarrel
with
fate
and
he
also
forgot
cecil
granthum
of
gilroy
ohio
until
slim
rode
up
and
handed
the
little
doctor
a
letter
addressed
in
that
bold
writing
that
chip
considered
a
little
the
ugliest
specimen
of
chirography
he
had
ever
seen
in
his
life
it
from
cecil
said
the
little
doctor
simply
and
unnecessarily
and
led
silver
back
down
the
hill
chip
gazing
at
that
tiresome
bluff
across
the
coulee
renewed
his
quarrel
with
fate
chapter
xv
the
spoils
of
victory
i
wish
while
i
gone
you
paint
me
another
picture
will
you
please
when
a
girl
has
big
gray
eyes
that
half
convince
you
they
are
not
gray
at
all
but
brown
or
blue
at
times
and
a
way
of
using
them
that
makes
a
fellow
heady
like
champagne
and
a
couple
of
dimples
that
will
dodge
into
her
cheeks
just
when
a
fellow
is
least
prepared
to
resist
them
why
what
can
a
fellow
do
but
knuckle
under
and
say
yes
especially
when
she
lets
her
head
tip
to
one
side
a
little
and
says
please
like
that
chip
tried
not
to
look
at
her
but
he
could
help
himself
very
well
while
she
stood
directly
in
front
of
him
he
compromised
weakly
instead
of
refusing
as
he
told
himself
he
wanted
to
do
i
do
know
maybe
i
ca
maybe
you
can
though
here
an
eighteen
by
canvas
and
here
are
all
the
paints
i
have
in
the
house
and
the
brushes
expect
to
see
something
worth
while
when
i
well
but
if
i
ca
look
here
straight
in
the
eye
if
you
please
now
will
you
try
chip
looking
into
her
eyes
that
were
laughing
but
with
a
certain
earnestness
behind
the
laugh
threw
up
his
hands
mentally
you
know
yes
i
try
how
long
are
you
going
to
be
gone
oh
perhaps
a
week
she
said
lightly
and
chip
heart
went
heavy
you
may
paint
any
kind
of
picture
you
like
but
i
rather
you
did
something
like
last
stand
only
better
and
put
your
brand
as
you
call
it
in
one
you
wo
sell
it
will
you
the
words
slipped
out
before
he
knew
no
no
i
wo
sell
it
for
it
wo
be
mine
it
for
yourself
this
then
there
wo
be
any
picture
said
chip
shortly
oh
yes
there
will
smiled
the
little
doctor
sweetly
and
went
away
before
he
could
contradict
her
perhaps
a
week
heavens
that
was
seven
days
and
every
day
had
at
least
sixteen
waking
hours
how
would
it
be
when
it
was
years
then
when
cecil
granthum
er
no
i
wo
the
invective
attached
to
that
gentleman
name
was
something
not
to
be
repeated
here
at
any
rate
a
week
was
a
long
long
time
to
put
in
without
any
gray
eyes
or
any
laugh
or
any
dimples
or
in
short
without
the
little
doctor
he
could
not
see
for
his
part
why
she
wanted
to
go
gadding
off
to
the
falls
with
len
adams
and
the
anyway
could
they
get
along
without
her
they
always
had
before
she
came
to
the
country
but
for
that
matter
so
had
he
the
problem
was
how
was
he
going
to
get
along
without
her
for
the
rest
of
his
life
what
did
they
want
to
stay
a
week
for
could
they
buy
everything
they
wanted
in
a
day
or
so
and
the
giant
spring
was
such
great
shakes
nor
the
rainbow
falls
that
they
need
to
hang
around
town
a
week
just
to
look
at
them
and
the
picture
what
was
he
such
a
fool
for
could
he
say
no
with
a
pair
of
gray
eyes
staring
into
his
it
seemed
not
he
supposed
he
must
think
up
something
to
daub
on
there
the
poorer
the
better
that
first
day
chip
smoked
something
like
two
dozen
cigarettes
gazed
out
across
the
coulee
till
his
eyes
ached
glared
morosely
at
the
canvas
on
the
easel
which
stared
back
at
him
till
the
dull
blankness
of
it
stamped
itself
upon
his
brain
and
he
could
see
nothing
else
look
where
he
might
whereupon
he
gathered
up
hat
and
crutches
and
hobbled
slowly
down
the
hill
to
tell
silver
his
troubles
the
second
day
threatened
to
be
like
the
first
chip
sat
by
the
window
and
smoked
but
little
by
little
the
smoke
took
form
and
substance
until
when
he
turned
his
eyes
to
the
easel
a
picture
looked
back
at
him
even
though
to
other
eyes
the
canvas
was
yet
blank
and
waiting
there
was
no
johnny
this
time
to
run
at
his
beckoning
he
limped
about
on
his
crutches
collected
all
things
needful
and
sat
down
to
work
as
he
sketched
and
painted
with
a
characteristic
rapidity
that
was
impatient
of
the
slightest
interruption
yet
patient
in
its
perfectness
of
detail
the
picture
born
of
the
smoke
grew
steadily
upon
the
canvas
it
seemed
at
first
that
the
last
stand
was
to
be
repeated
there
were
the
same
jagged
pinnacles
and
scrubby
pines
held
in
the
fierce
grip
of
the
frozen
chinook
the
same
but
there
was
a
difference
not
to
be
explained
perhaps
but
certainly
to
be
felt
the
little
hills
were
jagged
barren
hills
her
pines
were
very
nice
pines
indeed
chip
hills
were
jagged
they
were
barren
they
were
desolate
his
pines
were
shuddering
lonely
pines
for
he
had
wandered
alone
among
them
and
had
caught
the
message
of
the
wilderness
his
sky
was
the
cold
sinister
sky
of
the
last
stand
but
it
was
colder
more
sinister
for
it
was
night
a
young
moon
hung
low
in
the
west
its
face
half
hidden
behind
a
rift
of
scurrying
snow
clouds
the
tiny
basin
was
shadowy
and
vague
the
a
black
wall
touched
here
and
there
by
a
quivering
shaft
of
light
there
was
no
threatening
cow
with
lowered
horns
and
watchful
eye
there
was
no
calf
to
whip
up
her
flagging
courage
with
its
trust
in
her
the
wolves
yes
there
were
the
wolves
but
there
were
more
of
them
they
were
not
sitting
in
a
waiting
half
circle
they
were
scattered
unwatchful
two
of
them
in
the
immediate
foreground
were
wrangling
over
a
bone
the
rest
of
the
pack
were
nosing
a
heap
pitifully
eloquent
as
before
so
now
they
tricked
the
eye
into
a
fancy
that
they
lived
one
could
all
but
hear
the
snarls
of
the
two
standing
boldly
in
the
moonlight
the
hair
all
bristly
along
the
necks
the
white
fangs
gleaming
between
lips
one
felt
tempted
to
brace
oneself
for
the
rush
that
was
to
come
for
two
days
chip
shut
himself
in
his
room
and
worked
through
the
long
hours
of
daylight
jealous
of
the
minutes
darkness
stole
from
him
he
clothed
the
feast
in
a
merciful
shade
which
hid
the
repugnance
and
left
only
the
pathos
two
long
sharp
horns
which
gleamed
in
the
moonlight
but
were
no
longer
threatening
he
centered
his
energy
upon
the
two
wolves
in
the
foreground
grimly
determined
that
slim
should
pray
for
a
gatling
gun
when
he
saw
them
the
third
day
when
he
was
touching
up
the
shoulders
of
one
of
the
combatants
a
puff
of
wind
blew
open
the
door
which
led
to
the
parlor
he
did
not
notice
it
and
kept
steadily
at
work
painting
his
brand
into
a
corner
beneath
the
stump
and
its
splinter
he
lettered
his
name
a
thing
he
had
never
done
before
well
i
be
doggoned
chip
jumped
half
out
of
his
chair
giving
his
lame
ankle
a
jolt
which
made
him
grind
his
teeth
darn
it
chip
did
you
do
that
it
kind
of
looks
that
way
do
it
chip
was
plainly
disconcerted
and
his
ankle
hurt
h
the
old
man
eyed
it
sharply
a
minute
it
a
wonder
you
would
paint
in
a
howl
or
two
while
you
about
it
i
suppose
a
mate
to
doggone
you
chip
why
did
yuh
tell
us
you
painted
that
other
one
i
did
said
chip
getting
red
and
uncomfortable
except
the
cow
and
yes
except
the
part
that
makes
the
picture
worth
the
paint
it
done
with
snorted
the
old
man
i
must
say
i
never
thought
that
uh
dell
thought
what
flared
chip
hotly
forgetting
everything
but
that
the
little
doctor
was
being
censured
it
was
her
picture
she
started
it
and
intended
to
finish
it
i
painted
on
it
one
day
when
she
was
gone
and
she
did
know
it
i
told
her
not
to
tell
anyone
i
had
anything
to
do
with
it
it
was
her
huh
grunted
the
old
man
as
if
he
had
his
own
opinion
on
that
matter
well
it
a
rattling
good
picture
but
this
one
better
poor
ole
diamond
bar
she
could
come
through
with
it
after
all
she
put
up
a
good
fight
out
there
alone
but
she
had
t
go
under
her
an
her
he
stood
quiet
a
minute
gazing
and
gazing
doggone
them
measly
wolves
why
in
thunder
ca
a
feller
pump
lead
into
like
he
wants
t
chip
heart
glowed
within
him
his
technique
was
faulty
his
colors
daring
perhaps
but
his
triumph
was
for
that
the
greater
if
men
could
feel
his
pictures
and
they
did
that
was
the
joy
of
it
they
did
darn
them
snarlin
brutes
anyway
i
thought
it
was
doggone
queer
if
dell
could
dab
away
all
her
life
at
nice
common
things
that
you
only
think
is
purty
an
then
blossom
out
all
of
a
sudden
with
one
like
that
other
was
that
yuh
felt
all
up
an
down
yer
back
the
little
cheat
she
no
business
t
take
the
glory
uh
like
she
done
give
her
thunder
when
she
gits
you
wo
do
anything
of
the
kind
said
chip
quietly
too
quietly
not
to
be
menacing
i
tell
you
that
was
my
fault
i
gave
her
all
i
did
to
the
picture
and
i
told
her
not
to
say
anything
do
you
think
i
know
what
i
owe
to
her
do
you
think
i
do
know
she
saved
life
and
maybe
mine
forty
pictures
would
square
me
with
the
little
doctor
not
if
they
were
a
heap
better
than
they
are
and
she
claimed
every
darned
one
i
doing
this
and
i
thank
you
not
to
buy
in
where
you
not
wanted
this
picture
is
for
her
too
but
i
do
want
the
thing
shouted
from
the
housetops
when
you
go
out
i
wish
you
shut
the
the
old
man
thoroughly
subdued
took
the
hint
he
went
out
and
he
shut
the
door
chapter

weary
advises
i
have
a
short
article
here
which

interest
you
miss
della
said
dunk
coming
out
on
the
porch
a
few
days
later
with
a
butte
paper
in
his
hand
the
little
doctor
was
swinging
leisurely
in
the
hammock
it
about
the
picture
he
added
smiling
the
picture
oh
let
me
see
the
little
doctor
stopped
the
hammock
with
her
toe
and
sat
up
the
wind
had
tumbled
her
hair
about
her
face
and
drawn
extra
color
to
her
cheeks
and
she
looked
very
sweet
dunk
thought
he
held
out
the
paper
pointing
a
finger
at
the
place
he
wished
her
to
read
there
was
a
rather
large
headline
for
news
was
scarce
just
then
and
every
little
thing
was
made
the
most
of
the
eyes
of
the
little
doctor
clung
greedily
to
the
lines
it
is
reported
that
last
stand
has
been
sold
the
painting
which
has
been
on
exhibition
in
the
lobby
of
the
summit
hotel
has
attracted
much
attention
among
art
lovers
and
many
people
have
viewed
it
in
the
last
week
duncan
gray
whitaker
the
mine
owner
and
cattleman
who
brought
the
picture
to
butte
is
said
to
have
received
an
offer
which
the
artist
will
probably
accept
whitaker
still
declines
to
give
the
artist
name
but
whoever
he
is
he
certainly
has
a
brilliant
future
before
him
and
montana
can
justly
feel
proud
of
him
it
has
been
rumored
that
the
artist
is
a
woman
but
the
best
critics
are
slow
to
believe
this
claiming
that
the
work
has
been
done
with
a
power
and
boldness
undoubtedly
masculine
those
who
have
seen
last
will
not
easily
forget
it
and
the
price
offered
for
it
is
said
to
be
a
large
one
whitaker
will
leave
the
city
to
consult
the
unknown
artist
and
promises
upon
his
return
to
reveal
the
name
of
the
modest
genius
who
can
so
infuse
a
bit
of
canvas
with
palpitating
what
do
you
think
of
that
is
the
genius
rather
proud
of
the
hit
she
has
made
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
the
old
stockmen
stand
around
it
and
tell
wolf
stories
to
one
another
by
the
hour
the
women
came
and
cried
over
it
they
were
so
sorry
for
the
cow
really
miss
della
she
the
most
famous
cow
in
butte
just
now
i
had
plenty
of
smaller
offers
but
i
waited
till
senator
blake
came
home
he
a
crank
on
western
pictures
and
he
has
a
long
pocketbook
and
wo
haggle
over
prices
he
took
it
just
as
i
expected
but
he
insists
that
the
name
must
be
attached
to
it
and
if
you
take
his
offer
he
may
bring
the
picture
down
himself
for
he
quite
anxious
to
meet
you
i
am
to
wire
your
decision
at
the
little
doctor
watched
a
pale
green
measuring
worm
loop
its
way
hurriedly
along
the
floor
of
the
porch
she
was
breathing
rather
quickly
and
unevenly
and
she
seemed
to
be
thinking
very
fast
when
the
worm
reaching
the
end
doubled
out
of
sight
she
started
the
hammock
swinging
and
leaned
back
upon
her
cushions
you
may
tell
him
to
come
i
should
like
very
much
to
see
him
she
said
and
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
the
service
you
have
she
became
very
much
interested
in
a
magazine
and
seemed
to
dismiss
dunk
and
the
picture
entirely
from
her
mind
dunk
after
waiting
till
he
was
convinced
she
had
no
intention
of
saying
more
went
off
to
the
stables
to
find
a
messenger
for
the
telegram
telling
himself
on
the
way
that
miss
della
whitmore
was
a
very
cool
young
person
and
not
as
grateful
as
he
would
like
her
to
be
the
little
doctor
went
immediately
to
find
chip
but
that
young
man
who
had
been
just
inside
the
window
and
had
heard
every
word
was
not
so
easily
found
he
was
down
in
the
bunk
house
thinking
things
and
when
she
did
find
him
near
supper
time
he
was
so
utterly
unapproachable
that
her
courage
and
her
patience
failed
together
and
she
did
not
mention
the
picture
at
all
hello
doctor
it
was
a
heartening
voice
sounding
very
sweet
to
the
ears
of
the
little
doctor
just
then
she
turned
eagerly
her
arms
still
clasping
silver
neck
she
had
come
down
to
the
corral
to
feed
him
sugar
and
tell
him
what
a
very
difficult
young
man
his
master
was
and
how
he
held
her
at
arm
length
with
his
manner
and
yet
was
nice
and
friendly
and
sunny
enough
like
the
sun
shining
on
an
iceberg
but
human
sympathy
was
within
reach
of
her
hand
and
it
was
much
more
satisfying
than
the
mute
sympathy
of
a
horse
weary
willy
davidson
you
do
know
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
as
the
sayin
is
think
of
angels
an
their
opposets
ai
fur
off
i
am
glad
to
see
dirt
and
all
grinned
weary
for
he
had
ridden
far
in
the
heat
and
was
and
travelworn
he
pulled
the
saddle
off
glory
also
travelworn
and
and
gave
him
an
affectionate
slap
of
dismissal
i
chance
money
you
was
thinking
of
me
he
said
pointedly
how
is
the
old
ranch
anyhow
splinter
up
yet
you
must
think
i
a
feeble
excuse
for
a
doctor
retorted
she
of
course
he
up
he
walks
all
around
the
house
and
yard
with
a
cane
i
promoted
him
from
crutches
good
shot
that
was
sure
a
bad
foot
he
had
on
him
and
i
know
what
he
been
putting
in
the
time
at
making
pictures
or
love
pictures
said
the
little
doctor
hastily
laying
her
cheek
against
silver
mane
i
like
to
see
him
making
love
yuh
would
said
weary
innocently
disregarding
the
irony
of
her
tone
well
if
yuh
ever
do
i
tell
yuh
right
now
you
see
the
real
thing
if
he
makes
love
like
he
does
other
things
there
wo
any
female
girl
dodge
his
loop
that
straight
what
about
the
pictures
well
he
drew
a
picture
of
sliding
down
the
kitchen
steps
before
he
was
out
of
bed
and
he
made
a
picture
of
dunk
that
time
banjo
bucked
him
off
you
saw
that
happen
i
suppose
and
it
was
great
dunk
was
standing
on
his
head
in
front
of
his
horse
but
i
ca
show
you
it
because
it
blew
out
of
the
window
and
landed
at
dunk
feet
in
the
path
and
he
picked
it
up
and
tore
it
into
little
bits
and
he
does
play
in
chip
yard
any
he
never
did
grinned
weary
dunk
a
great
hand
to
go
around
shooting
off
his
mouth
about
things
he
no
business
to
buy
into
and
old
splinter
let
him
down
on
his
face
once
or
twice
chip
can
sure
give
a
man
a
hard
fall
when
he
wants
to
and
not
use
many
words
either
what
little
he
does
say
generally
the
little
doctor
memory
squirmed
assentingly
it
the
tone
he
uses
she
said
reflectively
the
way
he
can
say
sometimes
you
bumped
into
that
huh
bert
rogers
lit
into
him
with
a
tent
peg
once
for
saying
yes
at
him
they
sure
was
busy
for
a
few
minutes
i
just
sat
in
the
shade
of
a
wagon
wheel
and
laughed
till
i
near
cracked
a
rib
when
they
got
through
they
laughed
too
and
they
played
ten
games
uh
pool
together
that
night
and
got
weary
caught
himself
up
suddenly
pool
ai
any
gambling
game
he
hastened
to
explain
just
knocking
balls
into
the
pockets
innocent
like
yuh
mr
davidson
there
something
i
like
to
tell
you
about
will
you
wait
a
few
minutes
more
for
your
supper
sure
said
weary
wonderingly
and
sat
down
upon
the
edge
of
the
watering
trough
the
little
doctor
her
arms
still
around
silver
neck
told
him
all
about
the
last
stand
and
the
spoils
of
victory
and
chip
and
dunk
and
herself
and
weary
listened
silently
digging
little
trenches
in
the
hard
soil
with
the
rowels
of
his
spurs
and
knowing
chip
as
he
did
understanding
the
matter
much
better
than
did
the
little
doctor
and
he
does
seem
to
know
that
i
never
meant
to
claim
the
picture
as
my
work
and
i
ca
explain
while
he
acts
so
oh
you
know
how
he
can
act
and
dunk
would
have
sold
the
picture
if
he
had
known
chip
painted
it
and
it
was
wrong
of
course
but
i
did
so
want
chip
to
have
some
real
encouragement
so
he
would
make
that
his
life
work
you
know
he
is
fitted
for
something
better
than
and
now
the
picture
has
made
a
hit
and
brought
a
good
price
and
he
must
own
it
dunk
will
be
furious
of
course
but
that
does
matter
to
me
it
chip
that
i
ca
seem
to
weary
smiled
queerly
down
at
his
spurs
it
a
cinch
you
could
manage
him
easy
enough
if
you
took
the
right
way
to
do
it
he
said
quietly
probably
the
right
way
would
be
too
much
trouble
said
the
little
doctor
with
her
chin
well
up
once
i
get
this
picture
deal
settled
satisfactorily
i
quite
willing
to
resign
and
let
him
manage
himself
senator
blake
is
coming
and
i
so
glad
you
will
be
here
to
help
i
sure
like
to
see
yuh
through
with
the
deal
old
blake
wo
be
hard
to
throw
i
know
him
and
so
does
chip
did
he
tell
yuh
about
it
tell
me
flashed
the
little
doctor
i
told
him
senator
blake
was
coming
and
that
he
wanted
to
buy
the
picture
and
he
just
made
him
a
cigarette
and
said
and
after
that
there
was
any
conversation
of
any
description
weary
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
that
sure
sounds
just
like
him
he
said
and
at
that
minute
chip
himself
hobbled
into
the
corral
and
the
little
doctor
hastened
to
leave
it
and
retreat
to
the
house
chapter
xvii
when
a
maiden
wills
it
was
dunk
who
drove
to
meet
the
train
next
day
and
it
was
an
extremely
nervous
young
woman
who
met
senator
blake
upon
the
porch
chip
sprawled
in
the
hammock
on
the
east
porch
out
of
sight
the
senator
was
a
little
man
whose
coat
did
not
fit
and
whose
hair
was
sandy
and
sparse
and
who
had
keen
twinkling
blue
eyes
which
managed
to
see
a
great
deal
more
than
one
would
suspect
from
the
rest
of
his
face
he
pumped
the
little
doctor
hand
up
and
down
three
times
and
called
her
my
dear
young
after
the
first
ten
minutes
the
little
doctor
spirits
rose
considerably
and
her
heart
stopped
thumping
so
she
could
hear
it
she
remembered
what
weary
had
told
her
that
old
blake
wo
be
hard
to
she
no
longer
feared
the
senator
but
she
refused
to
speculate
upon
what
chip
might
do
he
seemed
more
approachable
but
that
did
not
count
probably
he
was
only
reflecting
weary
sunshine
and
would
freeze
solid
the
minute
and
so
you
are
the
mysterious
genius
who
has
set
the
butte
critics
by
the
ears
chuckled
the
senator
they
say
your
cloud
treatment
is
all
wrong
and
that
your
coloring
is
too
bold
but
directly
they
forget
all
that
and
wonder
which
wolf
will
make
the
first
dash
and
how
many
the
cow
will
put
out
of
business
before
she
goes
under
herself
do
be
offended
if
i
say
that
you
look
more
capable
of
portraying
woolly
white
lambs
at
play
than
ravening
wolves
measuring
the
strength
of
their
quarry
i
must
confess
i
was
looking
for
the
er
man
behind
that
i
told
the
senator
coming
out
that
it
was
a
lady
he
would
have
to
make
terms
with
he
would
hardly
believe
it
smiled
dunk
he
need
believe
it
said
the
little
doctor
much
more
calmly
than
she
felt
i
do
remember
ever
saying
that
i
painted
last
stand
dunk
threw
up
his
head
and
looked
at
her
sharply
genius
is
certainly
modest
he
said
with
a
laugh
that
was
not
nice
to
hear
in
this
case
the
genius
is
unusually
modest
assented
she
getting
rather
white
unfortunately
for
myself
senator
i
did
not
paint
the
wolves
which
caught
your
fancy
it
would
be
utterly
beyond
my
a
glimmering
of
the
truth
came
to
dunk
and
his
eyes
narrowed
who
did
paint
it
for
you
your
friend
chip
the
little
doctor
caught
her
breath
at
the
venomous
accent
he
employed
and
the
old
man
half
rose
from
his
chair
but
della
could
fight
her
own
battles
she
stood
up
and
faced
dunk
and
proud
yes
whitaker
my
friend
bennett
of
whose
friendship
i
am
rather
proud
painted
the
best
part
of
last
stand
senator
blake
must
forgive
my
being
misled
by
your
previous
statement
that
the
picture
was
yours
sneered
dunk
i
made
no
previous
statement
the
little
doctor
tone
was
sweetly
freezing
i
said
that
the
picture
which
i
had
begun
was
finished
and
i
invited
you
all
to
look
at
it
it
was
your
misfortune
that
you
took
too
much
for
it
a
mistake
to
take
anything
for
granted
where
a
woman
is
concerned
at
the
same
time
i
should
be
blamed
if
i
take
it
for
granted
chip
suppose
you
say
the
rest
to
me
dunk
suggested
chip
from
the
doorway
where
he
leaned
heavily
upon
his
cane
it
begins
to
look
as
though
i
held
a
hand
in
this
dunk
wheeled
furiously
upon
him
you
playing
a
high
hand
for
a
man
he
grated
and
you
about
reached
your
limit
the
stakes
are
beyond
your
reach
my
chip
went
white
with
anger
at
the
thrust
which
struck
deeper
than
dunk
knew
but
he
stood
his
ground
ye
es
wait
till
the
cards
are
all
it
turned
him
sick
though
the
emptiness
of
the
boast
it
was
such
a
pitiful
ghastly
bluff
for
the
cards
were
all
against
him
and
he
knew
it
a
man
in
gilroy
ohio
would
take
the
trick
which
decided
the
game
hearts
were
trumps
and
cecil
granthum
had
the
ace
the
little
senator
got
out
of
his
chair
and
faced
chip
tactfully
kid
bennett
you
rascal
are
you
going
to
shake
hands
his
own
was
outstretched
waiting
chip
crowded
several
hot
words
off
his
tongue
and
gave
up
his
hand
for
a
temporary
pump
handle
how
do
you
do
blake
i
did
think
you
remember
you
did
how
could
i
help
it
i
can
feel
the
cold
of
the
water
yet
and
your
rope
settling
over
my
shoulders
you
never
gave
me
a
chance
to
say
bless
you
for
that
you
just
coiled
up
your
rope
swearing
all
the
time
you
did
it
because
it
was
wet
and
rode
off
dripping
like
a
muskrat
what
did
you
do
it
for
i
was
in
a
hurry
to
get
back
to
camp
grinned
chip
sinking
into
a
chair
and
you
were
a
senator
it
would
have
been
all
the
same
if
i
had
been
i
reckon
responded
the
senator
shaking
chip
hand
again
well
well
so
you
are
the
genius
that
sounds
more
likely
no
offense
miss
whitmore
do
you
remember
that
picture
you
drew
with
charcoal
on
a
piece
of
pine
board
it
stands
on
the
mantel
in
my
library
and
i
always
point
it
out
to
my
friends
as
the
work
of
a
young
man
with
a
future
and
you
painted
last
stand
well
well
i
think
i
have
to
send
the
price
up
another
notch
just
to
get
even
with
you
for
swearing
at
me
when
my
lungs
were
so
full
of
water
i
could
swear
back
while
he
talked
he
was
busy
unwrapping
the
picture
which
he
had
brought
with
him
and
he
reminded
the
little
doctor
of
a
loquacious
peddler
opening
his
pack
he
was
much
more
genial
and
unpretentious
since
chip
entered
the
room
and
she
wondered
why
she
wanted
to
ask
about
that
reference
to
the
water
but
he
stood
the
painting
against
the
wall
just
then
and
she
forgot
everything
but
that
chip
eyes
clung
to
the
scene
greedily
after
all
it
was
his
and
he
knew
in
his
heart
that
it
was
good
after
a
minute
he
limped
into
his
room
and
brought
the
spoils
of
victory
and
stood
it
beside
the
last
a
the
senator
breathed
the
word
deep
in
his
throat
and
fell
silent
even
the
old
man
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
that
he
might
see
the
better
the
little
doctor
could
not
see
anything
just
then
but
no
one
noticed
anything
wrong
with
her
eyes
for
they
were
all
down
in
the
bad
lands
watching
an
old
range
cow
defend
her
calf
bennett
do
the
two
go
together
asked
the
senator
at
last
i
do
know
i
painted
it
for
miss
whitmore
said
chip
a
dull
glow
in
his
cheeks
the
little
doctor
glanced
at
him
quickly
rather
startled
if
the
truth
be
known
oh
that
was
just
a
joke
bennett
i
would
much
rather
have
you
paint
me
another
one
this
one
makes
me
want
to
cry
and
a
doctor
must
forego
the
luxury
of
tears
i
have
no
claim
upon
either
of
them
blake
it
was
like
this
i
started
last
stand
but
i
only
had
the
background
painted
and
one
day
while
i
was
gone
bennett
finished
it
up
and
it
is
his
work
that
makes
the
picture
worth
anything
i
let
it
pass
as
mine
for
the
time
but
i
never
intended
to
wear
the
laurel
crown
really
i
only
borrowed
it
for
a
little
while
i
hope
you
can
make
bennett
behave
himself
and
put
his
brand
on
it
for
if
he
does
it
will
go
down
to
posterity
unsigned
this
other
spoils
of
victory
he
can
not
attempt
to
disown
for
i
was
away
at
great
falls
when
he
painted
it
and
he
was
here
alone
so
far
as
help
of
any
kind
is
concerned
now
do
make
him
be
sensible
the
senator
looked
at
chip
then
at
the
little
doctor
chuckled
and
sat
down
on
the
couch
well
well
kid
bennett
has
changed
i
see
he
just
as
ornery
as
he
ever
was
and
you
the
mysterious
modest
genius
how
did
you
come
out
after
that
dip
into
the
old
missouri
he
asked
abruptly
you
did
take
cold
riding
in
those
wet
clothes
i
hope
i
no
i
was
all
right
i
stopped
at
that
sheep
camp
and
borrowed
some
dry
chip
was
very
uncomfortable
he
wished
blake
would
keep
bringing
up
that
affair
which
was
four
years
old
and
quite
trivial
in
his
opinion
it
was
a
good
thing
dunk
pulled
out
when
he
saw
he
got
the
worst
of
it
or
there
have
been
trouble
most
likely
and
blake
the
senator
went
on
addressing
the
others
do
you
know
what
this
young
fellow
did
four
years
ago
this
last
spring
i
tried
to
cross
the
river
near
my
place
in
a
little
boat
while
the
water
was
high
bennett
here
came
along
and
swore
that
a
man
with
no
more
sense
than
i
had
ought
to
drown
which
was
very
true
i
admit
i
had
just
got
out
a
nice
little
distance
for
drowning
properly
when
a
tree
came
bobbing
along
and
upset
my
boat
and
kid
bennett
as
we
called
him
then
rode
in
as
far
as
he
could
which
was
a
great
deal
further
than
was
safe
for
him
and
roped
me
just
as
he
would
have
roped
a
yearling
ha
ha
i
can
see
him
yet
scowling
at
me
and
whirling
the
loop
over
his
head
ready
to
throw
a
picture
of
that
now
when
he
had
dragged
me
to
the
bank
he
used
some
rather
strong
language
a
cowboy
does
hate
to
wet
his
rope
and
rode
off
before
i
had
a
chance
to
thank
him
this
is
the
first
time
i
seen
him
since
chip
got
very
red
i
was
young
and
foolish
those
days
and
you
were
a
senator
he
repeated
apologetically
my
being
a
senator
would
have
mattered
at
all
they
been
changing
your
name
over
this
side
the
river
i
see
how
did
that
happen
again
chip
was
uncomfortable
we
got
a
cook
that
is
out
of
sight
when
it
comes
to
saratoga
chips
and
i
a
fiend
for
them
you
see
the
boys
got
to
calling
me
saratoga
chip
and
then
they
cut
it
down
to
chip
and
stuck
to
i
see
there
was
a
fellow
with
you
over
there
davidson
what
has
become
of
him
weary
he
works
here
too
he
down
in
the
bunk
house
now
i
well
well
let
go
and
hunt
him
up
and
we
can
settle
about
the
pictures
at
the
same
time
you
seem
to
be
crippled
how
did
that
happen
some
performance
i
the
senator
smiled
reassuringly
at
the
little
doctor
and
got
chip
out
of
the
house
and
down
in
the
bunk
house
with
weary
and
whatever
means
he
used
to
make
chip
behave
himself
they
certainly
were
a
success
for
when
he
left
the
next
day
he
left
behind
him
a
check
of
generous
size
and
chip
was
not
so
aloof
as
he
had
been
with
the
little
doctor
and
planned
with
her
at
least
a
dozen
pictures
which
he
meant
to
paint
some
time
there
was
one
which
he
did
paint
at
once
however
though
no
one
saw
it
but
della
it
was
the
picture
of
a
slim
young
woman
with
gray
eyes
and
an
old
felt
hat
on
her
head
standing
with
her
fingers
tangled
in
the
mane
of
a
chestnut
horse
if
there
was
a
heartache
in
the
work
if
the
brush
touched
the
slim
figure
caressingly
and
lingered
wistfully
upon
the
face
no
one
knew
but
chip
and
chip
had
learned
long
ago
to
keep
his
own
counsel
there
were
some
thoughts
which
he
could
not
whisper
into
even
silver
ear
chapter
xviii
cecil
granthum
the
little
doctor
leaned
from
the
window
and
called
down
the
hill
to
her
recovered
patient
more
properly
her
nearly
recovered
patient
for
chip
still
walked
with
the
aid
of
a
cane
though
by
making
use
of
only
one
stirrup
he
could
ride
very
well
he
limped
up
the
hill
to
her
and
sat
down
on
the
top
step
of
the
porch
what
the
excitement
now
he
asked
banteringly
i
got
the
best
the
most
splendid
news
you
could
guess
what
in
a
thousand
years
then
i
wo
try
it
too
chip
took
off
his
hat
and
fanned
himself
with
it
well
ca
you
look
a
little
bit
excited
try
and
look
the
way
i
feel
anybody
as
cool
as
you
are
should
suffer
with
the
i
do
know
i
get
pretty
hot
sometimes
well
what
is
the
most
splendid
news
ca
you
tell
a
fellow
after
calling
him
up
here
in
the
hot
sun
well
listen
the
gilroy
hospital
you
know
where
cecil
is
chip
knew
has
a
case
of
blighted
love
and
shattered
hopes
chip
foolish
nearly
turned
a
somersault
was
it
possible
and
it
the
luckiest
thing
ever
yes
chip
wished
to
goodness
she
would
get
to
the
point
she
could
be
direct
enough
in
her
statements
when
what
she
said
was
going
to
hurt
a
fellow
his
heart
was
thumping
so
it
hurt
him
yes
a
doctor
there
was
planning
to
get
married
and
go
away
on
his
honeymoon
you
know
chip
nodded
half
suffocated
with
crowding
incredulous
hopes
well
and
now
he
is
his
ladylove
was
faithless
and
loves
another
and
his
honeymoon
is
indefinitely
postponed
do
you
see
now
where
the
good
news
comes
in
chip
shook
his
head
once
and
looked
away
up
the
grade
funny
but
something
had
gone
wrong
with
his
throat
he
was
half
choked
well
you
are
dull
now
that
fellow
is
going
to
have
any
vacation
so
cecil
can
come
out
right
away
next
week
think
of
it
chip
tried
to
think
of
it
but
he
could
think
of
anything
just
then
he
was
only
conscious
of
wishing
whizzer
had
made
a
finish
of
the
job
up
there
on
the
hog
back
that
day
his
heart
no
longer
thumped
it
was
throbbing
in
a
tired
listless
fashion
why
ca
you
look
a
little
bit
pleased
smiled
the
torturer
from
the
window
you
sit
there
like
a
an
indian
before
a
cigar
store
just
about
the
same
i
ca
help
it
i
never
was
fierce
to
meet
strangers
judging
from
my
own
experience
i
think
you
are
uncommonly
fierce
at
meeting
strangers
i
have
forgotten
how
unmercifully
you
snubbed
me
when
i
came
to
the
ranch
or
how
you
risked
my
neck
on
the
grade
up
there
trying
to
make
me
scared
enough
to
scream
i
did
though
i
wanted
to
i
admit
when
you
made
the
horses
run
down
the
steepest
part
but
i
did
and
so
i
could
easily
forgive
could
you
said
chip
in
a
colorless
tone
if
you
had
gained
your
object
i
could
have
remarked
she
i
did
you
did
did
you
do
it
just
to
frighten
me
chip
gave
her
a
glance
of
weary
tolerance
you
must
think
i
about
as
much
sense
as
a
jack
rabbit
i
was
taking
long
chances
to
run
that
well
for
pity
sake
what
did
you
do
it
for
it
was
the
only
thing
to
do
how
do
you
think
we
have
come
out
of
the
if
we
had
met
banjo
on
the
hog
back
where
there
is
room
to
pass
do
you
think
we
have
been
pretty
well
smashed
up
both
of
us
by
the
time
we
got
to
the
bottom
of
that
gully
there
a
runaway
horse
is
a
nasty
thing
to
meet
let
me
tell
you
especially
when
it
as
scared
as
banjo
was
they
wo
turn
out
they
just
go
straight
ahead
and
let
the
other
fellow
get
out
of
the
way
if
he
i
i
thought
you
did
it
just
for
a
joke
said
the
little
doctor
weakly
i
told
cecil
you
did
it
to
frighten
me
and
cecil
said
i
do
think
you
need
to
tell
me
what
cecil
said
chip
remarked
with
the
quiet
tone
that
made
one
very
uncomfortable
it
was
anything
so
dreadful
you
know
i
do
want
to
know
when
is
he
coming
did
you
say
next
wednesday
and
this
is
friday
i
know
you
like
chip
made
him
a
cigarette
but
he
had
heart
enough
to
light
it
he
held
it
absently
in
his
fingers
everybody
likes
yes
secretly
chip
had
his
doubts
he
knew
one
that
did
and
would
we
have
all
kinds
of
fun
and
go
everywhere
and
do
everything
as
soon
as
the
is
over
i
think
i
make
give
another
dance
but
i
take
care
that
the
drug
store
is
safely
locked
away
and
some
day
we
take
a
lunch
and
go
prowling
around
down
in
the
bad
lands
you
have
to
go
so
we
wo
get
lost
and
we
have
len
adams
and
rena
and
the
over
here
often
and
oh
my
brain
just
buzzes
with
plans
i
so
anxious
for
cecil
to
see
the
countess
and
well
everybody
around
here
you
i
sure
a
curiosity
said
chip
getting
on
his
feet
again
always
had
the
name
of
being
something
of
a
freak
i
do
wonder
you
want
to
exhibit
me
to
your
he
went
down
the
hill
to
the
bunk
house
holding
the
unlighted
cigarette
still
in
his
fingers
when
slim
opened
the
door
to
tell
him
supper
was
ready
he
found
chip
lying
on
his
bed
his
face
buried
in
his
arms
if
chip
never
had
understood
before
how
a
man
can
stand
up
straight
on
the
gallows
throw
back
his
shoulders
and
smile
at
his
executioner
he
learned
the
secret
during
that
mile
drive
to
dry
lake
with
the
little
doctor
he
would
have
shirked
the
ordeal
gladly
and
laid
awake
o
nights
planning
subterfuges
that
would
relieve
him
but
the
little
doctor
seemed
almost
malignantly
innocent
and
managed
to
checkmate
every
turn
she
could
not
trust
anyone
else
to
manage
the
creams
she
was
afraid
slim
might
get
drunk
while
they
waited
for
the
train
or
forget
his
duties
in
a
game
she
hated
way
of
fussing
over
trifles
and
would
have
him
along
chip
was
not
able
to
help
much
with
the
ranch
work
and
she
knew
he
could
manage
the
horses
so
much
better
than
anyone
else
and
cecil
had
been
in
a
runaway
once
and
so
was
dreadfully
nervous
behind
a
strange
team
which
last
declaration
set
chip
lips
the
woman
usually
does
have
her
own
way
in
the
end
and
so
chip
marched
to
the
gallows
with
his
chin
well
up
smiling
at
his
executioner
the
train
was
late
the
little
doctor
waited
in
the
hotel
parlor
and
chip
waited
in
the
hotel
saloon
longing
to
turn
a
deluge
of
whisky
down
his
throat
to
deaden
that
unbearable
heavy
ache
in
his
heart
but
instead
he
played
pool
with
bert
rogers
who
happened
to
be
in
town
that
day
and
took
cigars
after
each
game
instead
of
whiskey
varying
the
monotony
occasionally
by
lemon
soda
till
he
was
fairly
sick
then
the
station
agent
telephoned
up
that
the
train
was
coming
and
chip
threw
down
his
billiard
cue
swallowed
another
glass
of
lemon
soda
and
gagged
over
it
sent
bert
rogers
to
tell
the
little
doctor
the
train
was
coming
and
went
after
the
team
he
let
the
creams
lope
in
the
harness
all
the
way
to
the
depot
excusing
himself
on
the
plea
that
the
time
was
short
the
fact
was
chip
wanted
the
agony
over
as
soon
as
possible
nothing
so
wears
a
man
patients
as
to
have
a
disagreeable
duty
drag
at
the
depot
he
drove
around
to
the
back
where
freight
was
unloaded
with
the
explanation
that
the
creams
were
afraid
of
the
train
and
the
fact
of
that
matter
was
that
chip
was
afraid
cecil
might
greet
the
little
doctor
with
a
kiss
he
be
a
fool
if
he
did
and
chip
did
not
want
to
witness
the
salute
sitting
with
his
well
foot
in
the
brake
he
pictured
the
scene
on
the
other
side
of
the
building
when
the
train
pulled
in
and
stopped
he
could
not
hear
much
on
account
of
the
noise
the
engine
made
pumping
air
but
he
could
guess
about
what
was
taking
place
now
the
fellow
was
on
the
platform
probably
and
he
had
a
suit
case
in
one
hand
and
a
light
tan
overcoat
over
the
other
arm
and
now
he
was
advancing
toward
the
little
doctor
who
would
have
grown
shy
and
remained
by
the
door
now
he
had
changed
his
suit
case
to
the
other
hand
and
was
bending
down
over
oh
hell
he
settle
up
with
the
old
man
and
pull
out
back
across
the
river
old
blake
would
give
him
work
on
his
ranch
over
there
that
was
a
cinch
and
the
little
doctor
could
have
her
cecil
and
be
hanged
to
him
he
would
go
er
no
he
have
to
wait
till
silver
was
able
to
make
the
trip
for
he
would
leave
him
behind
no
he
could
go
just
yet
he
have
to
stay
with
the
deal
another
month
he
would
stay
a
day
longer
than
he
had
to
thought
you
could
gamble
on
that
there
the
train
was
sliding
out
say
what
if
the
fellow
had
come
though
such
a
possibility
had
not
before
occurred
to
chip
the
little
doctor
be
fighty
though
serve
her
right
the
little
flirt
er
no
he
could
think
anything
against
the
little
doctor
no
matter
what
she
did
no
he
sure
hate
to
see
her
disappointed
still
if
the
fellow
had
come
chip
would
be
to
blame
for
that
and
cecil
ca
you
drive
around
to
the
platform
now
to
load
in
the
trunk
sure
said
chip
with
deceitful
cheerfulness
and
took
his
foot
off
the
brake
while
the
little
doctor
went
back
to
her
cecil
the
agent
had
the
trunk
on
the
baggage
truck
and
trundled
it
along
the
platform
and
chip
eyes
searched
for
his
enemy
they
were
in
the
waiting
room
he
could
hear
that
laugh
of
the
little
doctor
lord
how
he
hated
to
hear
it
directed
at
some
other
fellow
that
is
yes
there
was
the
suit
case
it
looked
just
as
he
had
expected
it
would
and
there
was
a
glimpse
of
tan
cloth
just
inside
the
door
chip
turned
to
help
the
agent
push
the
suit
case
under
the
seat
where
it
was
an
exceeding
tight
fit
getting
it
there
with
the
trunk
taking
up
so
much
room
when
he
straightened
up
the
little
doctor
stood
ready
to
get
into
the
buggy
and
behind
her
stood
cecil
granthum
smiling
in
a
way
that
disclosed
some
very
nice
teeth
cecil
this
is
bennett
the
that
i
have
mentioned
as
being
at
the
ranch
chip
allow
me
to
present
cecil
cecil
advanced
with
hand
out
invitingly
i
heard
so
much
about
chip
that
i
feel
very
well
acquainted
i
hope
you
wo
expect
me
to
call
you
bennett
for
i
sha
you
too
utterly
at
sea
to
make
reply
chip
took
the
offered
hand
in
his
hate
cecil
how
could
he
hate
this
big
breezy
young
woman
she
shook
his
hand
heartily
and
smiled
deep
into
his
troubled
eyes
and
drew
the
poison
from
his
wounds
in
that
one
glance
the
little
doctor
plumped
into
the
seat
and
made
room
for
cecil
like
the
spoiled
little
girl
that
she
was
compared
with
the
other
i
going
to
sit
in
the
middle
cecil
you
the
biggest
and
you
can
easily
hang
on
and
beside
this
young
man
is
so
fierce
with
strangers
that
he
snub
you
something
awful
if
we
give
him
a
chance
he
been
scheming
ever
since
i
told
him
you
were
coming
to
get
out
of
driving
in
to
meet
you
he
tried
to
make
me
take
slim
slim
cecil
smiled
at
chip
behind
the
little
doctor
back
and
chip
could
have
hugged
her
then
and
there
for
he
knew
somehow
that
she
understood
and
was
his
friend
i
should
like
very
much
to
say
that
it
seemed
to
chip
that
the
sun
shone
brighter
and
that
the
grass
was
greener
and
the
sky
several
shades
bluer
on
that
homeward
drive
but
i
must
record
the
facts
which
are
these
chip
did
not
know
whether
the
sun
shone
or
the
moon
and
he
care
just
so
there
was
light
to
see
the
hair
blowing
about
the
little
doctor
face
and
to
watch
the
dimple
come
and
go
in
the
cheek
next
him
and
whether
the
grass
was
green
and
the
sky
blue
or
whether
the
reverse
was
the
case
he
did
know
and
if
you
had
asked
him
he
might
have
said
tersely
that
he
did
care
a
darn
about
the
grass
that
is
if
he
gave
you
sufficient
attention
to
reply
at
all
chapter
xix
love

its
hour
bay
denver
broke
out
uh
the
little
pasture
announced
the
old
man
putting
his
head
in
at
the
door
of
the
blacksmith
shop
where
chip
was
hammering
gayly
upon
a
bent
branding
iron
for
want
of
a
better
way
to
kill
time
and
give
vent
to
his
surplus
energy
i
wish

feet

hammer
and
reached
for
his

be
down

from

yit
yuh
want
t
watch

denver
meet
her
he
scare
the
liver
out
uh
chip
was
well
aware
that
the
little
doctor
had
not
returned
from
denson
where
she
had
been
summoned
to
attend
one
of
the
children
who
had
run
a
rusty
nail
into
her
foot
she
had
gone
alone
for
cecil
was
learning
to
make
bread
and
had
refused
to
budge
from
the
kitchen
till
her
first
batch
was
safely
baked
chip
limped
hurriedly
to
the
corral
and
two
minutes
later
was
clattering
down
the
coulee
upon
blazes
after
the
runaway
denver
was
a
beautiful
bay
stallion
the
pride
and
terror
of
the
ranch
he
was
noted
for
his
speed
and
his
vindictive
hatred
of
the
more
plebeian
horses
scarcely
one
of
which
but
had
at
some
time
felt
his
teeth
in
their
flesh
and
he
was
hated
and
feared
by
them
all
he
stopped
at
the
place
where
the
trail
forked
tossed
his
crinkly
mane
triumphantly
and
looked
back
freedom
was
sweet
to
him
sweet
as
it
was
rare
his
world
was
a
roomy
box
stall
with
a
small
high
corral
adjoining
it
for
exercise
with
an
occasional
day
in
the
little
pasture
as
a
great
treat
two
miles
was
a
long
long
way
from
home
it
seemed
to
him
he
watched
the
hill
behind
a
moment
threw
up
his
head
and
trotted
off
up
the
trail
to
denson
chip
galloping
madly
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
fugitive
a
mile
away
set
his
teeth
together
and
swung
blazes
sharply
off
the
trail
into
a
bypath
which
intersected
the
road
further
on
he
hoped
the
little
doctor
was
safe
at
denson
but
at
that
very
moment
he
saw
her
ride
slowly
over
a
distant
ridge
now
there
was
a
race
denver
cantering
gleefully
down
the
trail
chip
spurring
desperately
across
the
prairie
the
little
doctor
had
disappeared
into
a
hollow
with
concho
pacing
slowly
half
asleep
the
reins
drooping
low
on
his
neck
the
little
doctor
loved
to
dream
along
the
road
and
concho
had
learned
to
do
likewise
and
to
enjoy
it
very
much
at
the
crest
of
the
next
hill
she
looked
up
saw
herself
the
apex
of
a
rapidly
shortening
triangle
and
grasped
instantly
the
situation
she
had
peeped
admiringly
and
fearsomely
between
the
stout
rails
of
the
little
round
corral
too
often
not
to
know
denver
when
she
saw
him
and
in
a
panic
turned
from
the
trail
toward
chip
concho
was
rudely
awakened
by
a
stinging
blow
from
her
whip
a
blow
which
filled
him
with
astonishment
and
reproach
he
laid
back
his
ears
and
galloped
angrily
not
in
the
path
the
little
doctor
was
too
frightened
for
that
but
straight
as
a
hawk
would
fly
denver
marking
concho
for
his
prey
and
not
to
be
easily
cheated
turned
and
followed
chip
swore
inwardly
and
kept
straight
ahead
leaving
the
path
himself
to
do
so
he
knew
a
deep
washout
lay
now
between
himself
and
the
little
doctor
and
his
only
hope
was
to
get
within
speaking
distance
before
she
was
overtaken
concho
fled
to
the
very
brink
of
the
washout
and
stopped
so
suddenly
that
his
forefeet
plowed
a
furrow
in
the
grass
and
the
little
doctor
came
near
going
clean
over
his
head
she
recovered
her
balance
and
cast
a
frightened
glance
over
her
shoulder
denver
was
rushing
down
upon
them
like
an
express
train
get
off
your
shouted
chip
making
a
trumpet
of
his
hands
fight
denver
off
with
your
whip
the
last
command
the
little
doctor
did
not
hear
distinctly
the
first
she
made
haste
to
obey
throwing
herself
from
the
saddle
she
slid
precipitately
into
the
washout
just
as
denver
thundered
up
snorting
a
challenge
concho
scared
out
of
his
wits
turned
and
tore
off
down
the
washout
whipped
around
the
end
of
it
and
made
for
home
his
enemy
at
his
heels
and
chip
after
the
two
of
them
leaning
low
over
his
horse
as
blazes
catching
the
excitement
and
urged
by
the
spurs
ran
like
an
antelope
the
little
doctor
climbing
the
steep
bank
to
level
ground
gazed
after
the
fleeing
group
with
consternation
here
was
she
a
long
four
miles
from
home
five
if
she
followed
the
windings
of
the
trail
and
it
looked
very
much
as
if
her
two
feet
must
take
her
there
the
prospect
was
not
an
enlivening
one
but
she
started
off
across
the
prairie
very
philosophically
at
first
very
dejectedly
later
on
and
very
angrily
at
last
the
sun
was
scorching
and
it
was
dinner
time
and
she
was
hungry
and
hot
and
tired
and
she
did
not
bless
her
rescuer
she
heaped
maledictions
upon
his
head
mild
ones
at
first
but
growing
perceptibly
more
forcible
and
less
genteel
as
the
way
grew
rougher
and
her
feet
grew
wearier
and
her
stomach
emptier
then
as
if
her
troubles
were
all
to
come
in
a
lump
as
they
have
a
way
of
doing
she
stepped
squarely
into
a
bunch
of
pincushion
cactus
i
just
hate
montana
she
burst
out
vehemently
blinking
back
some
tears
i
do
care
if
cecil
did
just
come
day
before
yesterday
i
shall
pack
up
and
go
back
home
she
can
stay
if
she
wants
to
but
i
wo
live
here
another
day
i
hate
chip
bennett
too
and
i
tell
him
so
if
i
ever
get
home
i
do
see
what
thinking
of
to
live
in
such
a
hole
where
there
nothing
but
miles
upon
miles
of
cactuses
the
downfall
of
eastern
to
deliberately
say
cactuses
but
the
provocation
was
great
i
admit
if
any
man
doubts
let
him
tread
upon
a
healthy
little
pincushion
and
be
convinced
i
think
he
will
confess
that
cactuses
is
an
exceedingly
conservative
epithet
and
all
too
mild
for
the
occasion
half
an
hour
later
chip
leading
concho
by
the
bridle
rein
rode
over
the
brow
of
a
hill
and
came
suddenly
upon
the
little
doctor
sitting
disconsolately
upon
a
rock
she
had
one
shoe
off
and
was
striving
petulantly
to
extract
a
cactus
thorn
from
the
leather
with
a
hat
pin
chip
rode
close
and
stopped
regarding
her
with
satisfaction
from
the
saddle
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
succeeded
in
finding
the
little
doctor
alone
since
the
arrival
of
cecil
granthum
god
bless
her
hello
what
you
trying
to
do
no
answer
the
little
doctor
refused
even
to
lift
her
lashes
which
were
wet
and
clung
together
in
little
groups
of
two
or
three
chip
also
observed
that
there
were
suggestive
streaks
upon
her
cheeks
and
not
a
sign
of
a
dimple
anywhere
he
lifted
one
leg
over
the
horn
of
the
saddle
to
ease
his
ankle
which
still
pained
him
a
little
after
a
ride
and
watched
her
a
moment
what
the
matter
doctor
step
on
a
cactus
oh
no
snapped
the
doctor
in
a
tone
to
take
one
head
off
i
step
on
a
cactus
i
just
walked
all
over
acres
and
acres
of
them
there
was
a
suspicious
gurgle
from
somewhere
the
little
doctor
looked
up
do
hesitate
to
laugh
bennett
if
you
happen
to
feel
that
way
bennett
evidently
felt
that
way
he
rocked
in
the
saddle
and
shouted
with
laughter
the
little
doctor
stood
this
for
as
much
as
a
minute
oh
no
doubt
it
very
funny
to
set
me
afoot
away
off
from
everywhere
her
voice
quivered
and
broke
from
her
head
bent
lower
over
her
shoe
chip
made
haste
to
stifle
his
mirth
in
fear
that
she
was
going
to
cry
he
could
have
endured
that
he
reached
for
his
tobacco
and
began
to
make
a
cigarette
i
did
set
you
afoot
he
said
that
was
a
bad
break
you
made
yourself
why
did
you
do
as
i
told
you
hang
to
the
bridle
and
fight
denver
off
with
your
whip
you
had
yes
and
let
him
gnaw
me
chip
gurgled
again
and
drew
the
tobacco
sack
shut
with
his
teeth
he
would
you
he
would
have
come
near
you
he
whip
trained
and
i
have
been
there
myself
in
another
i
did
want
you
there
and
i
do
pretend
to
be
a
bennett
there
several
things
about
your
old
ranch
life
that
i
know
and
do
want
to
know
i
going
back
to
ohio
so
there
yes
he
drew
a
match
sharply
along
his
stamped
and
applied
it
to
the
cigarette
pinched
out
the
blaze
with
extreme
care
and
tossed
the
facetiously
against
concho
nose
he
did
not
seem
particularly
alarmed
at
her
threat
or
perhaps
he
did
not
care
the
little
doctor
prodded
savagely
at
her
shoe
too
angry
to
see
the
thorn
and
chip
drove
another
nail
into
his
coffin
with
apparent
relish
and
watched
her
after
a
little
he
slid
to
the
ground
and
limped
over
to
her
here
give
me
that
shoe
you
have
it
all
picked
to
pieces
and
not
get
the
thorn
either
where
is
it
it
sniffed
the
little
doctor
surrendering
the
shoe
with
hypocritical
reluctance
it
there
a
dozen
at
the
very
least
chip
emptied
his
lungs
of
smoke
and
turned
the
shoe
in
his
hands
oh
i
guess
not
there
is
room
in
this
little
bit
of
leather
for
a
dozen
two
would
be
i
detest
flattery
above
all
things
but
being
a
woman
the
brow
of
the
little
doctor
cleared
perceptibly
yes
you
just
like
me
in
that
respect
i
love
the
thinking
of
cecil
the
little
doctor
grew
guiltily
red
but
she
had
never
said
cecil
was
a
man
she
reflected
with
what
comfort
she
could
the
boys
like
dunk
had
simply
made
the
mistake
of
taking
too
much
for
granted
chip
opened
the
smallest
blade
of
his
knife
deliberately
sat
down
upon
a
neighboring
rock
and
finished
his
cigarette
still
turning
the
shoe
reflectively
and
caressingly
in
his
hand
i
smile
to
see
the
countess
try
to
put
that
shoe
on
he
remarked
holding
the
cigarette
in
some
mysterious
manner
on
his
lip
i
bet
she
could
get
one
toe
in
i
do
see
that
it
matters
whether
she
could
or
not
snapped
the
little
doctor
for
goodness
sake
hurry
you
pretty
mad
are
you
inquired
he
shoving
his
hat
back
off
his
forehead
and
looking
at
her
as
though
he
enjoyed
doing
so
do
i
look
mad
asked
she
tartly
i
tell
a
man
you
do
well
my
appearance
does
half
express
the
state
of
my
mind
your
mind
must
be
in
an
awful
it
two
minutes
passed
silently
dr
cecil
bread
is
done
she
gave
me
a
slice
as
big
as
your
hat
with
butter
and
jelly
on
it
it
was
out
of
the
little
doctor
groaned
and
rallied
butter
and
jelly
on
my
hat
did
you
say
not
on
your
hat
on
the
bread
i
ate
it
coming
back
down
the
coulee
and
i
sure
had
my
hands
full
leading
concho
the
little
doctor
held
back
the
question
trembling
on
her
hungry
parched
lips
as
long
as
she
could
but
it
would
come
was
it
good
i
tell
a
man
said
chip
briefly
and
eloquently
the
little
doctor
sighed
dr
cecil
granthum
a
mighty
good
fellow
i
stuck
on
him
myself
and
if
i
have
got
the
symptoms
sized
up
wrong
the
old
going
to
that
all
the
good
it
will
do
him
cecil
and
i
are
going
somewhere
and
practice
medicine
together
and
we
are
either
of
us
going
to
get
married
ever
have
you
got
the
papers
for
that
grinned
chip
utterly
unmoved
i
have
my
license
said
the
little
doctor
coldly
you
ahead
of
me
there
for
i
have
yet
i
can
soon
get
one
i
wish
to
goodness
you
hurry
up
with
that
shoe
i
half
well
show
me
a
dimple
and
you
can
have
it
my
you
are
cranky
the
little
doctor
showed
him
two
and
chip
laid
the
shoe
in
her
lap
after
he
had
surprised
himself
and
the
doctor
by
planting
a
daring
little
kiss
upon
the
toe
the
idea
exclaimed
she
with
a
feeble
show
of
indignation
and
slipped
her
foot
hurriedly
into
its
orthodox
covering
feeling
his
inscrutable
hazel
eyes
upon
her
she
blushed
uncomfortably
and
fumbled
the
laces
you
better
let
me
lace
that
shoe
you
wo
have
it
done
in
a
thousand
years
at
that
if
you
in
a
hurry
said
she
without
looking
at
him
you
can
ride
on
ahead
it
would
please
me
better
if
you
yes
you
been
pleased
all
summer
at
my
expense
i
going
to
please
myself
this
time
it
my
deal
little
doctor
do
you
want
to
know
what
trumps
no
i
do
still
without
looking
at
him
she
tied
her
shoelaces
with
an
impatient
twitch
that
came
near
breaking
them
and
walked
haughtily
to
where
concho
stood
dutifully
waiting
with
an
impulsive
movement
she
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
hid
her
hot
face
against
his
scanty
mane
a
pair
of
arms
clad
in
striped
sleeves
went
suddenly
about
her
her
clasp
on
concho
loosened
and
she
threw
back
her
head
startled
to
be
still
more
startled
at
the
touch
of
lips
that
were
curved
and
thin
and
masterful
the
arms
whirled
her
about
and
held
her
against
a
heart
which
her
trained
senses
knew
at
once
was
beating
very
irregularly
you
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
she
asserted
feebly
at
last
i
not
the
arms
tightened
their
clasp
a
little
you
you
do
seem
to
be
admitted
the
little
doctor
meekly
for
answer
he
kissed
her
hungrily
not
once
but
many
times
are
you
going
to
let
me
go
she
demanded
afterward
but
very
faintly
no
said
he
boldly
i
going
to
keep
you
there
was
conviction
in
the
tone
she
stood
silent
a
minute
listening
to
his
heart
and
her
own
and
digesting
this
bit
of
news
are
you
quite
sure
about
that
she
asked
at
length
i
tell
a
man
unless
he
held
her
off
and
looked
at
her
you
like
me
but
you
do
do
you
his
eyes
were
searching
her
face
the
little
doctor
struggled
to
release
herself
from
the
arms
which
held
her
unyieldingly
and
tenderly
failing
this
she
raised
her
eyes
to
the
white
silk
handkerchief
knotted
around
his
throat
to
the
chin
to
the
lips
wistful
with
their
well
defined
curve
to
the
eyes
where
they
lingered
shyly
a
moment
and
then
looked
away
to
the
horizon
do
you
like
me
say
he
gave
her
a
gentle
shake
ye
does
seem
to
matter
whether
i
do
or
not
she
retorted
with
growing
spirit
witness
the
dimple
dodging
into
her
cheek
yes
it
does
it
matters
a
whole
heap
you
dealt
me
misery
ever
since
i
first
set
eyes
on
you
and
i
believe
on
my
soul
you
liked
to
watch
me
squirm
but
you
do
like
me
do
you
i
i
tell
a
man
said
she
and
immediately
hid
a
very
red
face
from
sight
of
him
concho
turned
his
head
and
gazed
wonderingly
upon
the
two
what
amazed
him
was
to
see
chip
kissing
his
mistress
again
and
again
and
to
hear
the
idolatrous
tone
in
which
he
was
saying
my
little
doctor
the
end
